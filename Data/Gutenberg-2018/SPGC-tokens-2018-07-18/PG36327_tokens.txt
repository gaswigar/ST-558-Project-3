chapter
i
introductory
christ
testimony
with
regard
to
his
sufferings
christ
came
to
do
the
will
of
his
father
the
testimony
of
the
father
at
his
baptism
and
transfiguration
in
the
last
chapter
of
luke
gospel
is
to
be
found
a
deeply
interesting
account
of
several
events
that
took
place
on
the
day
that
the
redeemer
was
resurrected
amongst
other
incidents
he
relates
that
on
that
day
two
of
the
disciples
took
a
melancholy
journey
from
jerusalem
to
the
neighboring
village
of
emmaus
whilst
they
walked
the
sadness
of
their
hearts
found
expression
on
their
tongues
and
they
mournfully
rehearsed
to
each
other
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
of
their
master
by
and
by
they
were
joined
by
an
apparent
stranger
who
though
none
other
than
the
resurrected
savior
was
not
recognized
by
them
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
they
repeated
the
sad
history
of
the
days
just
passed
and
expressed
the
disappointment
that
his
death
had
brought
for
they
trusted
that
it
had
been
he
who
should
have
redeemed
israel
then
jesus
said
unto
them
o
fools
and
slow
of
heart
to
believe
all
that
the
prophets
have
spoken
ought
not
christ
to
have
suffered
these
things
and
to
enter
into
his
glory
and
beginning
at
moses
and
all
the
prophets
he
expounded
unto
them
in
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
himself
luke
xxiv
when
they
reached
emmaus
with
characteristic
eastern
hospitality
they
constrained
the
stranger
to
abide
with
them
he
consented
and
as
they
sat
at
meat
he
took
bread
and
blessed
it
brake
and
gave
unto
them
then
their
eyes
were
opened
and
they
knew
him
and
he
vanished
out
of
their
sight
and
they
rose
up
the
same
hour
and
returned
to
jerusalem
and
found
the
eleven
gathered
together
and
them
that
were
with
them
saying
the
lord
is
risen
indeed
and
hath
appeared
to
simon
and
they
told
what
things
were
done
in
the
way
and
how
he
was
known
of
them
in
breaking
of
bread
and
as
they
thus
spake
jesus
himself
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
and
saith
unto
them
peace
be
unto
you
after
the
savior
had
convinced
the
disciples
then
present
of
his
identity
and
had
partaken
of
some
broiled
fish
and
an
honey
comb
he
said
unto
them
these
are
the
words
which
i
spake
unto
you
while
i
was
yet
with
you
that
all
things
must
be
fulfilled
which
were
written
in
the
law
of
moses
and
in
the
prophets
and
in
the
psalms
concerning
me
then
opened
he
their
understanding
that
they
might
understand
the
scriptures
and
said
unto
them
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behooved
christ
to
suffer
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
day
and
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
nations
beginning
at
jerusalem
and
ye
are
witnesses
of
these
things
one
great
and
very
striking
statement
is
here
made
by
the
lord
himself
to
the
effect
that
it
behooved
christ
to
suffer
and
the
question
at
once
presents
itself
before
us
why
did
it
behoove
him
or
why
was
it
necessary
that
he
should
suffer
for
it
would
seem
from
his
language
through
his
sufferings
death
atonement
and
resurrection
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
could
be
preached
among
all
nations
and
that
consequently
if
he
had
not
atoned
for
the
sins
of
the
world
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
could
not
have
been
preached
to
the
nations
a
very
important
principle
is
here
enunciated
one
in
which
the
interests
of
the
whole
human
family
throughout
all
the
world
are
involved
that
principle
is
the
offering
up
of
the
son
of
god
as
a
sacrifice
an
atonement
and
a
propitiation
for
our
sins
jesus
said
he
came
not
to
do
his
will
but
the
will
of
his
father
who
sent
him
he
came
as
we
are
told
to
take
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
and
not
only
did
he
come
but
he
came
in
accordance
with
certain
preconceived
ideas
that
had
been
entertained
and
testified
of
by
prophets
and
men
of
god
in
all
preceding
ages
or
from
the
days
of
adam
to
the
days
of
john
the
baptist
the
latter
being
his
precursor
or
forerunner
who
indeed
when
he
saw
him
coming
made
the
declaration
behold
the
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
at
his
baptism
the
spirit
of
god
bore
witness
to
this
testimony
and
descended
upon
jesus
in
the
form
of
a
dove
or
rather
the
form
of
a
dove
was
the
sign
of
the
holy
spirit
whilst
a
voice
was
heard
from
heaven
proclaiming
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
this
manifestation
of
god
acknowledgment
of
his
beloved
son
was
spoken
of
by
personal
witnesses
who
bore
record
to
the
facts
matthew
testifies
then
cometh
jesus
from
galilee
to
jordan
unto
john
to
be
baptized
of
him
but
john
forbade
him
saying
i
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
and
jesus
answering
said
unto
him
suffer
it
to
be
so
now
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
then
he
suffered
him
and
jesus
when
he
was
baptized
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
water
and
lo
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him
and
he
saw
the
spirit
of
god
descending
like
a
dove
and
lighting
upon
him
and
lo
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
matthew
iii
whilst
mark
relates
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
jesus
came
from
nazareth
of
galilee
and
was
baptized
of
john
in
jordan
and
straightway
coming
up
out
of
the
water
he
saw
the
heavens
opened
and
the
spirit
like
a
dove
descending
upon
him
and
there
came
a
voice
from
heaven
saying
thou
art
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
mark
i
and
john
in
his
gospel
states
that
john
the
baptist
bare
record
saying
i
saw
the
spirit
descending
from
heaven
like
a
dove
and
it
abode
upon
him
and
i
knew
him
not
but
he
that
sent
me
to
baptize
with
water
the
same
said
unto
me
upon
whom
thou
shalt
see
the
spirit
descending
and
remaining
on
him
the
same
is
he
which
baptizeth
with
the
holy
ghost
and
i
saw
and
bare
record
that
this
is
the
son
of
god
john
i
we
have
this
great
truth
of
the
open
recognition
of
jesus
by
his
father
as
his
beloved
son
again
enunciated
when
the
three
apostles
peter
james
and
john
were
on
the
mount
and
jesus
was
transfigured
before
them
it
is
declared
that
a
bright
cloud
overshadowed
them
and
behold
a
voice
out
of
the
cloud
which
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
hear
ye
him
matthew
xvii
the
son
thus
openly
acknowledged
came
not
to
earth
to
do
his
own
will
but
the
will
of
his
father
the
will
of
the
father
appears
to
have
been
that
the
son
should
suffer
for
he
himself
prayed
o
my
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
nevertheless
not
as
i
will
but
as
thou
wilt
matthew
xxvi
or
as
the
new
translation
by
the
prophet
joseph
smith
has
it
o
my
father
if
this
cup
may
not
pass
away
from
me
except
i
drink
it
thy
will
be
done
the
father
did
not
let
it
pass
from
him
he
therefore
drank
it
and
finally
on
the
cross
he
said
it
is
finished
and
bowed
his
head
and
gave
up
the
ghost
in
regard
to
this
jesus
himself
testifies
first
to
the
nephites
behold
i
am
jesus
christ
whom
the
prophets
testified
shall
come
into
the
world
and
behold
i
am
the
light
and
life
of
the
world
and
i
have
drunk
out
of
that
bitter
cup
which
the
father
hath
given
me
and
have
glorified
the
father
in
taking
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
in
the
which
i
have
suffered
the
will
of
the
father
in
all
things
from
the
beginning

nephi

and
again
in
this
dispensation
he
bears
witness
for
behold
i
god
have
suffered
these
things
for
all
that
they
might
not
suffer
if
they
would
repent
but
if
they
would
not
repent
they
must
suffer
even
as
i
which
suffering
caused
myself
even
god
the
greatest
of
all
to
tremble
because
of
pain
and
to
bleed
at
every
pore
and
to
suffer
both
body
and
spirit
and
would
that
i
might
not
drink
the
bitter
cup
and
shrink
nevertheless
glory
be
to
the
father

the
saying
of
our
savior
to
which
we
have
already
alluded
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behooved
christ
to
suffer
is
a
very
important
one
and
it
would
seem
to
be
necessary
in
the
consideration
of
our
subject
for
us
to
obtain
from
the
writings
of
the
servants
of
god
that
we
have
an
understanding
what
these
statements
were
how
extensively
they
were
corroborated
by
the
sacred
records
and
what
is
said
with
regard
to
the
necessity
of
christ
sufferings
thus
referred
to
and
furthermore
we
may
notice
the
reason
why
they
should
be
thus
necessary
in
making
this
examination
we
will
first
quote
from
the
writings
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
although
we
are
informed
by
later
revelations
that
many
parts
which
are
plain
and
most
precious
have
been
taken
away
therefrom
yet
there
is
a
large
amount
of
testimony
left
in
this
valuable
and
sacred
record
which
plainly
exhibits
that
the
principle
of
the
atonement
was
fully
understood
by
the
prophets
in
former
ages
chapter
ii
the
testimony
of
jesus
the
spirit
of
prophecy
the
declarations
of
the
ancient
servants
of
god
extracts
from
the
writings
and
testimonies
of
moses
job
david
isaiah
zechariah
micah
and
hosea
to
be
found
in
the
old
testament
with
remarks
in
the
chapter
of
luke
gospel
to
which
we
have
already
referred
speaking
of
jesus
it
is
written
beginning
with
moses
and
all
the
prophets
he
expounded
unto
them
in
all
the
scriptures
the
things
concerning
himself
if
this
be
taken
in
the
fullest
sense
and
we
know
of
no
reason
why
it
should
not
thus
be
received
there
is
a
great
principle
developed
which
is
that
not
only
moses
but
all
the
prophets
testified
concerning
the
coming
redeemer
as
elsewhere
stated
this
must
have
been
the
case
for
we
are
told
that
the
testimony
of
jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
this
being
admitted
how
could
they
have
the
spirit
of
prophecy
or
be
prophets
without
having
the
testimony
of
jesus
and
we
are
told
further
that
the
prophets
sought
what
manner
of
time
the
spirit
of
christ
which
was
in
them
did
signify
when
it
testified
beforehand
the
sufferings
of
christ
and
the
glory
that
should
follow
peter
i
these
scriptures
evidently
show
that
the
testimony
of
jesus
was
the
very
principle
essence
and
power
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
whereby
they
were
inspired
we
find
a
great
many
statements
corroborative
of
these
facts
in
those
portions
of
the
writings
and
prophecies
of
the
ancient
servants
of
god
that
have
been
handed
down
to
us
in
the
old
testament
and
from
these
testimonies
we
select
a
few
to
show
how
various
and
how
detailed
have
been
the
inspired
utterances
regarding
the
life
and
death
of
the
messiah
the
lord
thy
god
will
raise
up
unto
thee
a
prophet
from
the
midst
of
thee
of
thy
brethren
like
unto
me
moses
unto
him
ye
shall
hearken
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
they
have
well
spoken
that
which
they
have
spoken
i
will
raise
them
up
a
prophet
from
among
their
brethren
like
unto
thee
and
will
put
my
words
in
his
mouth
and
he
shall
speak
unto
them
all
that
i
shall
command
him
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
will
not
hearken
unto
my
words
which
he
shall
speak
in
my
name
i
will
require
it
of
him
xviii
for
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth
and
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
body
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
whom
i
shall
see
for
myself
and
mine
eyes
shall
behold
and
not
another
though
my
reins
be
consumed
within
me
job

why
do
the
heathen
rage
and
the
people
imagine
a
vain
thing
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
saying
let
us
break
their
bands
asunder
and
cast
away
their
cords
from
us
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh
the
lord
shall
have
them
in
derision
then
shall
he
speak
unto
them
in
his
wrath
and
vex
them
in
his
sore
displeasure
yet
have
i
set
my
king
upon
my
holy
hill
of
zion
i
will
declare
the
decree
the
lord
hath
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
ask
of
me
and
i
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
possession
thou
shalt
break
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
thou
shalt
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter
vessel
be
wise
now
therefore
o
ye
kings
be
instructed
ye
judges
of
the
earth
serve
the
lord
with
fear
and
rejoice
with
trembling
kiss
the
son
lest
he
be
angry
and
ye
perish
from
the
way
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
little
blessed
are
all
they
that
put
their
trust
in
him
psalm
ii
while
the
first
portion
of
the
above
psalm
refers
to
the
anointed
of
the
lord
and
matters
that
would
take
place
at
his
first
appearing
still
many
of
the
things
therein
mentioned
have
not
yet
transpired
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
following
passages
from
zechariah
which
speak
of
his
being
pierced
and
of
his
rejection
by
the
jews
as
a
thing
accomplished
when
at
that
time
these
events
had
not
taken
place
but
it
does
prove
that
his
people
would
reject
and
pierce
him
and
that
afterwards
when
he
should
come
as
their
deliverer
like
joseph
whom
his
brethren
sold
appeared
as
their
deliverer
in
egypt
they
should
look
upon
him
whom
they
had
pierced
and
i
will
pour
upon
the
house
of
david
and
upon
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
the
spirit
of
grace
and
of
supplications
and
they
shall
look
upon
me
whom
they
have
pierced
and
they
shall
mourn
for
him
as
one
mourneth
for
his
only
son
and
shall
be
in
bitterness
for
him
as
one
that
is
in
bitterness
for
his
first
born
xii
and
one
shall
say
unto
him
what
are
these
wounds
in

hands

he
shall
answer

with
which

was
wounded

grow
up

him
as
a
tender
plant
and
as
a
root
out
of
a
dry
ground
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
and
when
we
shall
see
him
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him
he
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him
he
was
despised
and
we
esteemed
him
not
surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
yet
we
did
esteem
him
stricken
smitten
of
god
and
afflicted
but
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
he
was
oppressed
and
he
was
afflicted
yet
he
opened
not
his
mouth
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
openeth
not
his
mouth
he
was
taken
from
prison

from
judgment
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
for
the
transgression
of
my
people
was
he
stricken
and
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
rich
in
his
death
because
he
had
done
no
violence
neither
was
any
deceit
in

mouth
yet
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
he
hath
put
him
to
grief
when
thou
shalt
make
his
soul
an
offering

sin
he

psalm
xvi
this
expression
of
the
psalmist
evidently
refers
to
the
resurrection
of
the
son
of
god
it
is
so
quoted
by
paul
in
his
sermon
at
antioch
and
we
declare
unto
you
glad
tidings
how
that
the
promise
which
was
made
unto
the
fathers
god
hath
fulfilled
the
same
unto
us
their
children
in
that
he
hath
raised
up
jesus
again
as
it
is
also
written
in
the
second
psalm
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
and
as
concerning
that
he
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
now
no
more
to
return
to
corruption
he
said
on
this
wise
i
will
give
you
the
sure
mercies
of
david
wherefore
he
saith
also
in
another
psalm
thou
shalt
not
suffer
thine
holy
one
to
see
corruption
for
david
after
he
had
served
his
own
generation
by
the
will
of
god
fell
on
sleep
and
was
laid
unto
his
fathers
and
saw
corruption
but
he
whom
god
raised
again
saw
no
corruption

this

sabbath
day
and
stood
up
for
to
read
and
there
was
delivered
unto
him
the
book
of
the
prophet
esaias
and
when
he
had
opened
the
book
he
found
the
place
where
it
was
written
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the

set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
to
preach
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
and
he
closed
the
book
and
he
gave
it
again
to
the
minister
and
sat
down
and
the
eyes
of
all
them
that
were
in
the
synagogue
were
fastened
on
him
and
he
began
to
say
unto
them

chapter
iii
extracts
from
the
new
testament
touching
the
personal
history
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
remarks
on
the
times
of
refreshing
results
accruing
to
the
redeemer
through
his
death
on
the
cross
etc
from
the
new
testament
we
will
first
introduce
some
texts
with
regard
to
the
birth
of
the
savior
followed
by
testimonies
of
the
lord
jesus
with
regard
to
himself
and
afterwards
give
extracts
from
the
teachings
and
epistles
of
his
disciples
etc
now
the
birth
of
jesus
christ
was
on
this
wise
when
as
his
mother
mary
was
espoused
to
joseph
before
they
came
together
she
was
found
with
child
of
the
holy
ghost
then
joseph
her
husband
being
a
just
man
and
not
willing
to
make
her
a
public
example
was
minded
to
put
her
away
privily
but
while
he
thought
on
these
things
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
in
a
dream
saying
joseph
thou
son
of
david
fear
not
to
take
unto
thee
mary
thy
wife
for
that
which
is
conceived
in
her
is
of
the
holy
ghost
and
she
shall
bring
forth
a
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
sins
now
all
this
was
done
that
it
might
be
fulfilled
which
was
spoken
of
the
lord
by
the
prophet
saying
behold
a
virgin
shall
be
with
child
and
shall
bring
forth
a
son
and
they
shall
call
his
name
emmanuel
which
being
interpreted
is
god
with
us
matthew
i
and
in
the
sixth
month
the
angel
gabriel
was
sent
from
god
unto
a
city
of
galilee
named
nazareth
to
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
joseph
of
the
house
of
david
and
the
virgin
name
was
mary
and
the
angel
came
in
unto
her
and
said
hail
thou
that
art
highly
favored
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
when
she
saw
him
she
was
troubled
at
his
saying
and
cast
in
her
mind
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should
be
and
the
angel
said
unto
her
fear
not
mary
for
thou
hast
found
favor
with
god
and
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
womb
and
bring
forth
a
son
and
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
he
shall
be
great
and
shall
be
called
the
son
of
the
highest
and
the
lord
god
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
david
and
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
forever
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
end
then
said
mary
unto
the
angel
how
shall
this
be
seeing
i
know
not
a
man
and
the
angel
answered
and
said
unto
her
the
holy
ghost
shall
come
upon
thee
and
the
power
of
the
highest
shall
overshadow
thee
therefore
also
that
holy
thing
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
son
of
god
and
behold
thy
cousin
elisabeth
she
hath
also
conceived
a
son
in
her
old
age
and
this
is
the
sixth
month
with
her
who
was
called
barren
for
with
god
nothing
shall
be
impossible
and
mary
said
behold
the
handmaid
of
the
lord
be
it
unto
me
according
to
thy
word
and
the
angel
departed
from
her
and
mary
arose
in
those
days
and
went
into
the
with
haste
into
a
city
of
juda
and
entered
into
the
house
of
zacharias
and
saluted
elisabeth
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
elisabeth
heard
the
salutation
of
mary
the
babe
leaped
in
her
womb
and
elisabeth
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
she
spake
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
blessed
is
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
and
whence
is
this
to
me
that
the
mother
of
my
lord
should
come
to
me
for
lo
as
soon
as
the
voice
of
thy
salutation
sounded
in
mine
ears
the
babe
leaped
in
my
womb
for
joy
and
blessed
is
she
that
believed
for
there
shall
be
a
performance
of
those
things
which
were
told
her
from
the
lord
and
mary
said
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
and
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
god
my
savior
for
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
handmaiden
for
behold
from
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
blessed
for
he
that
is
mighty
hath
done
to
me
great
things
and
holy
is
his
name
and
his
mercy
is
on
them
that
fear
him
from
generation
to
generation
he
hath
shewed
strength
with
his
arm
he
hath
scattered
the
proud
in
the
imagination
of
their
hearts
he
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seats
and
exalted
them
of
low
degree
he
hath
filled
the
hungry
with
good
things
and
the
rich
he
hath
sent
empty
away
he
hath
holpen
his
servant
israel
in
remembrance
of
his
mercy
as
he
spake
to
our
fathers
to
abraham
and
to
his
seed
forever
luke
i
and
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
that
there
went
out
a
decree
from
cesar
augustus
that
all
the
world
should
be
taxed
and
this
taxing
was
first
made
when
cyrenius
was
governor
of
syria
and
all
went
to
be
taxed
every
one
into
his
own
city
and
joseph
also
went
up
from
galilee
out
of
the
city
of
nazareth
into
judea
unto
the
city
of
david
which
is
called
bethlehem
because
he
was
of
the
house
and
lineage
of
david
to
be
taxed
with
mary
his
espoused
wife
being
great
with
child
and
so
it
was
that
while
they
were
there
the
days
were
accomplished
that
she
should
be
delivered
and
she
brought
forth
her
first
born
son
and
wrapped
him
in
and
laid
him
in
a
manger
because
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
the
inn
and
there
were
in
the
same
country
shepherds
abiding
in
the
field
keeping
watch
over
their
flock
by
night
and
lo
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shone
round
about
them
and
they
were
sore
afraid
and
the
angel
said
unto
them
fear
not
for
behold
i
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
joy
which
shall
be
to
all
people
for
unto
you
is
born
this
day
in
the
city
of
david
a
savior
which
is
christ
the
lord
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you
ye
shall
find
the
babe
wrapped
in
lying
in
a
manger
and
suddenly
there
was
with
the
angel
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
god
and
saying
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
and
on
earth
peace
good
will
toward
men
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
angels
were
gone
away
from
them
into
heaven
the
shepherds
said
one
to
another
let
us
now
go
even
unto
bethlehem
and
see
this
thing
which
is
come
to
pass
which
the
lord
hath
made
known
unto
us
luke
ii
when
jesus
came
into
the
coasts
of
cesarea
philippi
he
asked
his
disciples
saying
whom
do
men
say
that
i
the
son
of
man
am
and
they
said
some
say
that
thou
art
john
the
baptist
some
elias
and
others
jeremias
or
one
of
the
prophets
he
saith
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
and
simon
peter
answered
and
said
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
simon
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee
but
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
then
charged
he
his
disciples
that
they
should
tell
no
man
that
he
was
jesus
the
christ
xvi
of
this
same
conversation
mark
records
and
jesus
went
out
and
his
disciples
into
the
towns
of
cesarea
philippi
and
by
the
way
he
asked
his
disciples
saying
unto
them
whom
do
men
say
that
i
am
and
they
answered
john
the
baptist
but
some
say
elias
and
others
one
of
the
prophets
and
he
saith
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
and
peter
answereth
and
saith
unto
him
thou
art
the
christ
and
he
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
of
him
and
he
began
to
teach
them
that
the
son
of
man
must
suffer
many
things
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
of
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
killed
and
after
three
days
rise
again
and
he
spake
that
saying
openly
mark
viii
whilst
luke
testifies
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
alone
praying
his
disciples
were
with
him
and
he
asked
them
saying
whom
say
the
people
that
i
am
they
answering
said
john
the
baptist
but
some
say
elias
and
others
say
that
one
of
the
old
prophets
is
risen
again
he
said
unto
them
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
peter
answering
said
the
christ
of
god
and
he
straitly
charged
them
and
commanded
them
to
tell
no
man
that
thing
saying
the
son
of
man
must
suffer
many
things
and
be
rejected
of
the
elders
and
chief
priests
and
scribes
and
be
slain
and
be
raised
the
third
day
luke
ix
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
for
god
sent
not
his
son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
world
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
saved
john
iii
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
are
from
beneath
i
am
from
above
ye
are
of
this
world
i
am
not
of
this
world
i
said
therefore
unto
you
that
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins
for
if
ye
believe
not
that
i
am
he
ye
shall
die
in
your
sins
then
said
they
unto
him
who
art
thou
and
jesus
saith
unto
them
even
the
same
that
i
said
unto
you
from
the
beginning
i
have
many
things
to
say
and
to
judge
of
you
but
he
that
sent
me
is
true
and
i
speak
to
the
world
those
things
which
i
have
heard
of
him
they
understood
not
that
he
spake
to
them
of
the
father
then
said
jesus
unto
them
when
ye
have
lifted
up
the
son
of
man
then
shall
ye
know
that
i
am
he
and
that
i
do
nothing
of
myself
but
as
my
father
hath
taught
me
i
speak
these
things
and
he
that
sent
me
is
with
me
the
father
hath
not
left
me
alone
for
i
do
always
those
things
that
please
him
john
viii
then
answered
jesus
and
said
unto
them
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
himself
but
what
he
seeth
the
father
do
for
what
things
soever
he
doeth
these
also
doeth
the
son
likewise
for
the
father
loveth
the
son
and
sheweth
him
all
things
that
himself
doeth
and
he
will
shew
him
greater
works
than
these
that
ye
may
marvel
for
as
the
father
raiseth
up
the
dead
and
quickeneth
them
even
so
the
son
quickeneth
whom
he
will
for
the
father
judgeth
no
man
but
hath
committed
all
judgment
unto
the
son
that
all
men
should
honor
the
son
even
as
they
honor
the
father
he
that
honoreth
not
the
son
honoreth
not
the
father
which
hath
sent
him
but
i
have
greater
witness
than
that
of
john
for
the
works
which
the
father
hath
given
me
to
finish
the
same
works
that
i
do
bear
witness
of
me
that
the
father
hath
sent
me
and
the
father
himself
which
hath
sent
me
hath
borne
witness
of
me
ye
have
neither
heard
his
voice
at
any
time
nor
seen
his
shape
and
ye
have
not
his
word
abiding
in
you
for
whom
he
hath
sent
him
ye
believe
not
search
the
scriptures
for
in
them
ye
think
ye
have
eternal
life
and
they
are
they
which
testify
of
me
john
v
jesus
heard
that
they
had
cast
him
out
and
when
he
had
found
him
he
said
unto
him
dost
thou
believe
on
the
son
of
god
he
answered
and
said
who
is
he
lord
that
i
might
believe
on
him
and
jesus
said
unto
him
thou
hast
both
seen
him
and
it
is
he
that
talketh
with
thee
and
he
said
lord
i
believe
and
he
worshipped
him
and
jesus
said
for
judgment
i
am
come
into
this
world
that
they
which
see
not
might
see
and
that
they
which
see
might
be
made
blind
john
ix
i
am
the
good
shepherd
and
know
my
sheep
and
am
known
of
mine
as
the
father
knoweth
me
even
so
know
i
the
father
and
i
lay
down
my
life
for
the
sheep
and
other
sheep
i
have
which
are
not
of
this
fold
them
also
i
must
bring
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
i
know
them
and
they
follow
me
and
i
give
unto
them
eternal
life
and
they
shall
never
perish
neither
shall
any
pluck
them
out
of
my
hand
my
father
which
gave
them
me
is
greater
than
all
and
none
is
able
to
pluck
them
out
of
my
father
hand
i
and
my
father
are
one
john
x
and
while
they
abode
in
galilee
jesus
said
unto
them
the
son
of
man
shall
be
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
men
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
the
third
day
he
shall
be
raised
again
and
they
were
exceeding
sorry
xvii
of
this
same
prophecy
mark
relates
and
they
departed
thence
and
passed
through
galilee
and
he
would
not
that
any
man
should
know
it
for
he
taught
his
disciples
and
said
unto
them
the
son
of
man
is
delivered
into
the
hands
of
men
and
they
shall
kill
him
and
after
that
he
is
killed
he
shall
rise
the
third
day
but
they
understood
not
that
saying
and
were
afraid
to
ask
him
mark
ix
and
luke
states
and
they
were
all
amazed
at
the
mighty
power
of
god
but
while
they
wondered
every
one
at
all
things
which
jesus
did
he
said
unto
his
disciples
let
these
sayings
sink
down
into
your
ears
for
the
son
of
man
shall
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
men
but
they
understood
not
this
saying
and
it
was
hid
from
them
that
they
perceived
it
not
and
they
feared
to
ask
him
of
that
saying
luke
ix
and
as
they
were
eating
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
it
and
gave
it
to
the
disciples
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
and
he
took
the
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
drink
ye
all
of
it
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
xxvi
and
as
they
did
eat
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
and
brake
it
and
gave
to
them
and
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
and
he
took
the
cup
and
when
he
had
given
thanks
he
gave
it
to
them
and
they
all
drank
of
it
and
he
said
unto
them
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
mark
xiv
and
he
took
bread
and
gave

and
gave
unto
them
saying
this
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
likewise
also
the
cup
after
supper
saying
this
cup
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood
which
is
shed
for
you
luke
xxii
for
the
son
of
man

in
the
glory

his
father
with
his
angels
and
then
he
shall
reward
every
man
according
to
his
works
xvi
take
heed
that
ye
despise
not
one
of
these
little
ones
for
i
say
unto
you
that
in
heaven
their
angels
do
always
behold
the
face
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
for
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
save
that
which
was
lost
xviii
then
the
eleven
disciples
went
away
into
galilee
into
a
mountain
where
jesus
had
appointed
them
and
when
they
saw
him
they
worshipped
him
but
some
doubted
and
jesus
came
and
spake
unto
them
saying
all
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
you
and
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
amen
xxviii
then
said
jesus
unto
the
twelve
will
ye
also
go
away
then
simon
peter
answered
him
lord
to
whom
shall
we
go
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
life
and
we
believe
and
are
sure
that
thou
art
that
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
john
vi
him
being
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
ye
have
taken
and
by
wicked
hands
have
crucified
and
slain
whom
god
hath
raised
up
having
loosed
the
pains
of
death
because
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
it
acts
ii
this
jesus
hath
god
raised
up
whereof
we
all
are
witnesses
therefore
being
by
the
right
hand
of
god
exalted
and
having
received
of
the
father
the
promise
of
the
holy
ghost
he
hath
shed
forth
this
which
ye
now
see
and
hear
for
david
is
not
ascended
into
the
heavens
but
he
saith
himself
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thy
foes
thy
footstool
therefore
let
all
the
house
of
israel
know
assuredly
that
god
hath
made
that
same
jesus
whom
ye
have
crucified
both
lord
and
acts
ii
and
now
brethren
i
wot
that
through
ignorance
ye
did
it
as
did
also
your
rulers
but
those
things
which
god
before
had
shewed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
that
christ
should
suffer
he
hath
so
fulfilled
repent
ye
therefore
and
be
converted
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
out
when
the
times
of
refreshing
shall
come
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
send
jesus
christ
which
before
was
preached
unto
you
whom
the
heavens
must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
of
all
things
which
god
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began
for
moses
truly
said
unto
the
fathers
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
soul
which
will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
destroyed
from
among
the
people
yea
and
all
the
prophets
from
samuel
and
those
that
follow
after
as
many
as
have
spoken
have
likewise
foretold
of
these
days
acts
iii
does
it
not
seem
from
this
that
these
men
having
committed
the
infamous
act
of
crucifying
jesus
or
consenting
to
his
death
although
they
may
have
done
it
ignorantly
could
not
at
that
time
even
by
repentance
and
conversion
be
placed
in
a
state
of
salvation
but
that
they
would
have
to
wait
until
jesus
christ
should
come
again
before
their
sins
could
be
blotted
out
when
jesus
christ
should
be
sent
who
before
was
preached
unto
them
and
whom
they
had
crucified
is
not
this
the
same
condition
that
the
antediluvians
were
in
when
once
the
long
suffering
of
god
waited
in
the
days
of
noah
when
they
were
cast
into
prison
and
remained
there
until
the
time
when
jesus
went
and
preached
to
those
spirits
in
prison
in
their
day
they
rejected
the
offers
of
mercy
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
as
the
jews
did
in
their
time
but
afterwards
they
had
the
same
gospel
preached
to
them
by
jesus
and
those
jews
who
had
participated
in
those
deeds
or
who
had
consented
thereto
to
whom
the
apostle
then
spake
even
if
they
then
repented
would
have
to
wait
for
forgiveness
and
salvation
until
jesus
should
come
again
furthermore
the
jews
who
will
live
in
the
times
of
the
restitution
in
the
last
days
after
the
testimony
of
the
gospel
shall
have
gone
to
the
gentiles
through
this
same
atonement
and
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
will
again
have
it
preached
to
them
on
the
earth
and
will
through
him
the
elias
or
restorer
be
gathered
again
to
their
own
land
be
it
known
unto
you
all
and
to
all
the
people
of
israel
that
by
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
whom
ye
crucified
whom
god
raised
from
the
dead
even
by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
whole
this
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
naught
of
you
builders
which
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
other
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
saved
acts
iv
but
he
stephen
being
full
of
the
holy
ghost
looked
up
steadfastly
into
heaven
and
saw
the
glory
of
god
and
jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
and
said
behold
i
see
the
heavens
opened
and
the
son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
acts
vii
the
place
of
the
scripture
which
he
read
was
this
he
was
led
as
a
sheep
to
the
slaughter
and
like
a
lamb
dumb
before
his
shearer
so
opened
he
not
his
mouth
in
his
humiliation
his
judgment
was
taken
away
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
his
life
is
taken
from
the
earth
acts
viii
take
heed
therefore
unto
yourselves
and
to
all
the
flock
over
the
which
the
holy
ghost
hath
made
you
overseers
to
feed
the
church
of
god
which
he
hath
purchased
with
his
own
blood
acts
xx
the
next
day
john
seeth
jesus
coming
unto
him
and
saith
behold
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
john
i
for
all
have
sinned
and
come
short
of
the
glory
of
god
being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
jesus
whom
god
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
blood
to
declare
his
righteousness
for
the
remission
of
sins
that
are
past
through
the
forbearance
of
god
iii
but
for
us
also
to
whom
it
shall
be
imputed
if
we
believe
on
him
that
raised
up
jesus
our
lord
from
the
dead
who
was
delivered
for
our
offences
and
was
raised
again
for
our
justification
iv
but
god
commendeth
his
love
toward
us
in
that
while
we
were
yet
sinners
christ
died
for
us
much
more
then
being
now
justified
by
his
blood
we
shall
be
saved
from
wrath
through
him
for
if
when
we
were
enemies
we
were
reconciled
to
god
by
the
death
of
his
son
much
more
being
reconciled
we
shall
be
saved
by
his
life
and
not
only
so
but
we
also
joy
in
god
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
we
have
now
received
the
atonement
wherefore
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
by
sin
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
men
for
that
all
have
sinned
v
for
i
delivered
unto
you
first
of
all
that
which
i
also
received
how
that
christ
died
for
our
sins
according
to
the
scriptures
and
that
he
was
buried
and
that
he
rose
again
the
third
day
according
to
the
scriptures
and
that
he
was
seen
of
cephas
then
of
the
twelve
after
that
he
was
seen
of
above
five
hundred
brethren
at
once
of
whom
the
greater
part
remain
unto
this
present
but
some
are
fallen
asleep
after
that
he
was
seen
of
james
then
of
all
the
apostles
and
last
of
all
he
was
seen
of
me
also
as
of
one
born
out
of
due
time
for
i
am
the
least
of
the
apostles
that
am
not
meet
to
be
called
an
apostle
because
i
persecuted
the
church
of
god
xv
to
the
praise
of
the
glory
of
his
grace
wherein
he
hath
made
us
accepted
in
the
beloved
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
blood
the
forgiveness
of
sins
according
to
the
riches
of
his
grace
ephesians
i
giving
thanks
unto
the
father
which
hath
made
us
meet
to
be
partakers
of
the
inheritance
of
the
saints
in
light
who
hath
delivered
us
from
the
power
of
darkness
and
hath
translated
us
into
the
kingdom
of
his
dear
son
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
blood
even
the
forgiveness
of
sins
who
is
the
image
of
the
invisible
god
the
of
every
creature
and
he
is
the
head
of
the
body
the
church
who
is
the
beginning
the
firstborn
from
the
dead
that
in
all
things
he
might
have
the
for
it
pleased
the
father
that
in
him
should
all
fulness
dwell
and
having
made
peace
through
the
blood
of
his
cross
by
him
to
reconcile
all
things
unto
himself
by
him
i
say
whether
they
be
things
in
earth
or
things
in
heaven
i
from
the
above
passage
we
learn
that
our
redemption
is
obtained
through
the
blood
of
jesus
that
he
is
in
the
image
of
god
again
that
he
is
the
firstborn
of
every
creature
also
that
he
is
the
from
the
dead
and
furthermore
that
he
stands
preeminent
as
the
representative
of
god
in
the
interests
of
humanity
pertaining
to
this
world
or
the
world
which
is
to
come
and
that
he
is
the
head
of
the
church
the
grand
medium
through
which
all
blessings
flow
to
the
human
family
beware
lest
any
man
spoil
you
through
philosophy
and
vain
deceit
after
the
tradition
of
men
after
the
rudiments
of
the
world
and
not
after
christ
for
in
him
dwelleth
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
bodily
and
ye
are
complete
in
him
which
is
the
head
of
all
principality
and
power
ii
for
there
is
one
god
and
one
mediator
between
god
and
men
the
man
christ
jesus
who
gave
himself
a
ransom
for
all
to
be
testified
in
due
time
ii
for
unto
which
of
the
angels
said
he
at
any
time
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
and
again
i
will
be
to
him
a
father
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
son
and
again
when
he
bringeth
in
the
into
the
world
he
saith
and
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
him
i
thou
hast
put
all
things
in
subjection
under
his
feet
for
in
that
he
put
all
in
subjection
under
him
he
left
nothing
that
is
not
put
under
him
but
now
we
see
not
yet
all
things
put
under
him
but
we
see
jesus
who
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
for
the
suffering
of
death
crowned
with
glory
and
honor
that
he
by
the
grace
of
god
should
taste
death
for
every
man
for
it
became
him
for
whom
are
all
things
and
by
whom
are
all
things
in
bringing
many
sons
unto
glory
to
make
the
captain
of
their
salvation
perfect
through
sufferings
ii
here
we
have
something
said
of
the
results
accruing
to
the
redeemer
himself
through
his
sufferings
and
death
he
stands
next
to
the
father
and
is
on
the
right
hand
of
god
angels
and
authorities
and
powers
being
made
subject
unto
him
peter
iii
or
as
he
elsewhere
says
of
himself
all
power
is
given
unto
me
in
heaven
and
in
earth
and
again
it
is
written
that
he
forever
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
god
from
henceforth
expecting
till
his
enemies
be
made
his
footstool
and
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
shall
bow
of
things
in
heaven
and
things
in
earth
and
things
under
the
earth
and
that
every
tongue
should
confess
that
jesus
christ
is
lord
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
philippians
ii
for
such
an
high
priest
became
us
who
is
holy
harmless
undefiled
separate
from
sinners
and
made
higher
than
the
heavens
who
needeth
not
daily
as
those
high
priests
to
offer
up
sacrifice
first
for
his
own
sins
and
then
for
the
people
for
this
he
did
once
when
he
offered
up
himself
for
the
law
maketh
men
high
priests
which
have
infirmity
but
the
word
of
the
oath
which
was
since
the
law
maketh
the
son
who
is
consecrated
forevermore
vii
there
is
something
peculiar
pertaining
to
the
expression
here
used
forevermore
which
manifestly
exhibits
an
eternal
principle
we
find
the
same
expression
as
elsewhere
alluded
to
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
to
adam
it
was
said
thou
shalt
do
all
that
thou
doest
in
the
name
of
the
son
and
thou
shalt
repent
and
call
upon
god
in
the
name
of
the
son
forevermore
the
same
principle
continued
both
on
the
asiatic
and
on
this
continent
and
was
recognized
by
all
men
of
god
holding
the
melchisedec
priesthood
and
will
be
recognized
throughout
all
time
until
the
final
consummation
of
all
things
when
every
knee
shall
bow
and
every
tongue
confess
that
jesus
is
the
christ
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
calves
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
in
once
into
the
holy
place
having
obtained
eternal
redemption
for
us
for
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
ashes
of
an
heifer
sprinkling
the
unclean
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
flesh
how
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
christ
who
through
the
eternal
spirit
offered
himself
without
spot
to
god
purge
your
conscience
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
god
and
almost
all
things
are
by
the
law
purged
with
blood
and
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
remission
ix
by
the
which
will
we
are
sanctified
through
the
offering
of
the
body
of
jesus
christ
once
for
all
and
every
priest
standeth
daily
ministering
and
offering
oftentimes
the
same
sacrifices
which
can
never
take
away
sins
but
this
man
after
he
had
offered
one
sacrifice
for

with
corruptible
things
as
silver
and

from
your
vain
conversation
received
by
tradition
from
your
fathers
but
with
the
precious
blood
of
christ
as
of
a
lamb
without
blemish
and
without
spot
who
verily
was
foreordained
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
was
manifest
in
these
last
times
for
you
peter
i
for
christ
also
hath
once
suffered
for
sins
the
just
for
the
unjust
that
he
might
bring
us
to
god
being
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
but
quickened
by
the
spirit
by
which
also
he
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison
which
sometime
were
disobedient
when
once
the
of
god
waited
in
the
days
of
noah
while
the
ark
was
a
preparing
wherein
few
that
is
eight
souls
were
saved
by
water
the
like
figure
whereunto
even
baptism
doth
also
now
save
us
not
the
putting
away
of
the
filth
of
the
flesh
but
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
toward
god
by
the
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
who
is
gone
into
heaven
and
is
on
the
right
hand
of
god
angels
and
authorities
and
powers

peter
iii
this
then
is
the
message
which
we
have
heard
of
him
and
declare
unto
you
that
god
is
light
and
in
him
is
no
darkness
at
all
if
we
say
that
we
have
fellowship
with
him
and
walk
in
darkness
we
lie
and
do
not
the
truth
but
if
we
walk
in
the
light
as
he
is
in
the
light
we
have
fellowship
one
with
another
and
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
his
son
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin
john
i
and
if
any
man
sin
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
father
jesus
christ
the
righteous
and
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
and
not
for
ours
only
but
also
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
john
ii
or
as
it
is
written
in
the
inspired
translation
but
if
any
man
sin
we
have
an
advocate
etc
and
from
jesus
christ
who
is
the
faithful
witness
and
the
of
the
dead
and
the
prince
of
the
kings
of
the
earth
unto
him
that
loved
us
and
washed
us
from
our
sins
in
his
own
blood
i
these
things
saith
the
amen
the
faithful
and
true
witness
the
beginning
of
the
creation
of
god
iii
and
when
he
had
taken
the
book
the
four
beasts
and
four
and
twenty
elders
fell
down
before
the
lamb
having
every
one
of
them
harps
and
golden
vials
full
of
odors
which
are
the
prayers
of
saints
and
they
sung
a
new
song
saying
thou
art
worthy
to
take
the
book
and
to
open
the
seals
thereof
for
thou
wast
slain
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
hast
made
us
unto
our
god
kings
and
priests
and
we
shall
reign
on
the
earth
v
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
from
all
nations
and
peoples
are
indebted
to
the
lord
jesus
christ
through
his
atonement
for
the
position
that
they
will
occupy
in
the
state
of
exaltation
here
referred
to
and
if
they
are
exalted
to
be
kings
and
priests
unto
god
it
is
through
the
ordinances
which
he
has
appointed
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
object

these
extracts
are
taken
from

of

prophet
joseph
smith
and
god
spake
unto
moses
saying
behold
i
am
the

almighty
and
endless
is
my
name
for
i
am
without
beginning
of

wherefore

and
i
will
show
thee
the
workmanship
of
mine
hands
but
not
all
for
my
works
are
without
end
and
also
my
words
for
they
never
cease
wherefore
no
man
can
behold
all
my
works
except
he
behold
all
my
glory
and
no
man
can
behold
all
my
glory
and
afterwards
remain
in

and
i
have
a
work
for
thee
moses
my
son
and
thou
art
in
the
similitude
of
mine
only
begotten
and
my
only
begotten
is
and
shall
be
the
savior
for
he
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
but
there
is
no
god
beside
me
and
all
things
are
present
with
me
for
i
know
them
all
pearl
of
great
price
and
in
that
day
the
holy
ghost
fell
upon
adam
which
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
the
son
saying
i
am
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
from
the
beginning
henceforth
and
for
ever
that
as
thou
hast
fallen
thou
mayest
be
redeemed
and
all
mankind
even
as
many
as
ibid
but
god
hath
made
known
unto
our
fathers
that
all
men
must
repent
and
he
called
upon
our
father
adam
by
his
own
voice
saying
i
am
god
i
made
the
world
and
men
before
they
were
in
the
flesh
and
he
also
said
unto
him
if
thou
wilt
turn
unto
me
and
hearken
unto
my
voice
and
believe
and
repent
of
all
thy
transgressions
and
be
baptized
even
in
water
in
the
name
of
mine
only
begotten
son
who
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
which
is
jesus
christ
the
only
name
which
shall
be
given
under
heaven
whereby
salvation
shall
come
unto
the
children
of
men
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
asking
all
things
in
his
name
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
it
shall
be
given
you
and
our
father
adam
spake
unto
the
lord
and
said
why
is
it
that
men
must
repent
and
be
baptized
in
water
and
the
lord
said
unto
adam
behold
i
have
forgiven
thee
thy
transgression
in
the
garden
of
eden
hence
came
the
saying
abroad
among
the
people
that
the
son
of
god
hath
atoned
for
original
guilt
wherein
the
sins
of
the
parents
can
not
be
answered
upon
the
heads
of
the
children
for
they
are
whole
from
the
foundation
of
the
ibid
wherefore
teach
it
unto
your
children
that
all
men
everywhere
must
repent
or
they
can
in
no
wise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
for
no
unclean
thing
can
dwell
there
or
dwell
in
his
presence
for
in
the
language
of
adam
man
of
holiness
is
his
name
and
the
name
of
his
only
begotten
is
the
son
of
man
even
jesus
christ
a
righteous
judge
who
shall
come
in
the
meridian
of
time
therefore
i
give
unto
you
a
commandment
to
teach
these
things
freely
unto
your
children
saying
that
by
reason
of
transgression
cometh
the
fall
which
fall
bringeth
death
and
inasmuch
as
ye
were
born
into
the
world
by
water
and
blood
and
the
spirit
which
i
have
made
and
so
became
of
dust
a
living
soul
even
so
ye
must
be
born
again
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
and
be
cleansed
by
blood
even
the
blood
of
mine
only
begotten
that
ye
might
be
sanctified
from
all
sin
and
enjoy
the
words
of
eternal
life
in
this
world
and
eternal
life
in
the
world
to
come
even
immortal
glory
for
by
the
water
ye
keep
the
commandment
by
the
spirit
ye
are
justified
and
by
the
blood
ye
are
sanctified
therefore
it
is
given
to
abide
in
you
the
record
of
heaven
the
comforter
the
peaceable
things
of
immortal
glory
the
truth
of
all
things
that
which
quickeneth
all
things
which
maketh
alive
all
things
that
which
knoweth
all
things
and
hath
all
power
according
to
wisdom
mercy
truth
justice
and
judgment
and
now
behold
i
say
unto
you
this
is
the
plan
of
salvation
unto
all
men
through
the
blood
of
mine
only
begotten
who
shall
come
in
the
meridian
of
ibid
and
he
gave
unto
me
enoch
a
commandment
that
i
should
baptize
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
who
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
and
the
holy
ghost
which
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
the
ibid
and
behold
enoch
saw
the
day
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
even
in
the
flesh
and
his
soul
rejoiced
saying
the
righteous
is
lifted
up
and
the
lamb
is
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
through
faith
i
am
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
and
behold
zion
is
with
me
ibid
and
great
tribulations
shall
be
among
the
children
of
men
but
my
people
will
i
preserve
and
righteousness
will
i
send
down
out
of
heaven
and
truth
will
i
send
forth
out
of
the
earth
to
bear
testimony
of
mine
only
begotten
his
resurrection
from
the
dead
yea
and
also
the
resurrection
of
all
ibid
and
it
came
to
pass
that
noah
continued
his
preaching
unto
the
people
saying
hearken
and
give
heed
unto
my
words
believe
and
repent
of
your
sins
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
even
as
our
fathers
did
and
ye
shall
receive
the
holy
ghost
that
ye
may
have
all
things
made
manifest
and
if
ye
do
not
this
the
floods
will
come
in
upon
ibid
and
if
thou
shalt
die
yet
thou
shalt
possess
it
the
land
of
canaan
for
the
day
cometh
that
the
son
of
man
shall
live
but
how
can
he
live
if
he
be
not
dead
he
must
first
be
quickened
and
it
came
to
pass
that
abram
looked
forth
and
saw
the
days
of
the
son
of
man
and
was
glad
and
his
soul
found
rest

him

the
body
he
shall
show
himself
unto
those
at
jerusalem
from
whence
we
came
for
it
is
expedient
that
it
should
be
among
them
for
it
behoveth
the
great
creator
that
he
suffereth
himself
to
become
subject
unto
man
in
the
flesh
and
die
for
all
men
that
all
men
might
become
subject
unto
him
for
as
death
hath
passed
upon
all
men
to
fulfil
the
merciful
plan
of
the
great
creator
there
must
needs
be
a
power
of
resurrection
and
the
resurrection
must
needs
come
unto
man
by
reason
of
the
fall
and
the
fall
came
by
reason
of
transgression
and
because
man
became
fallen
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
nephi
ix
wherefore
i
know
that
thou
art
redeemed
because
of
the
righteousness
of
thy
redeemer
for
thou
hast
beheld
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
he
cometh
to
bring
salvation
unto
men
and
thou
hast
beheld
in
thy
youth
his
glory
wherefore
thou
art
blessed
even
as
they
unto
whom
he
shall
minister
in
the
flesh
for
the
spirit
is
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
and
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
fall
of
man
and
salvation
is
free
and
men
are
instructed
sufficiently
that
they
know
good
from
evil
and
the
law
is
given
unto
men
and
by
the
law
no
flesh
is
justified
or
by
the
law
men
are
cut
off
yea
by
the
temporal
law
they
were
cut
off
and
also
by
the
spiritual
law
they
perish
from
that
which
is
good
and
become
miserable
for
ever
wherefore
redemption
cometh
in
and
through
the
holy
messiah
for
he
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
behold
he
offereth
himself
a
sacrifice
for
sin
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
law
unto
all
those
who
have
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
and
unto
none
else
can
the
ends
of
the
law
be
answered
wherefore
how
great
the
importance
to
make
these
things
known
unto
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
they
may
know
that
there
is
no
flesh
that
can
dwell
in
the
presence
of
god
save
it
be
through
the
merits
and
mercy
and
grace
of
the
holy
messiah
who
layeth
down
his
life
according
to
the
flesh
and
taketh
it
again
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
that
he
may
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
being
the
first
that
should
rise
wherefore
he
is
the
first
fruits
unto
god
inasmuch
as
he
shall
make
intercession
for
all
the
children
of
men
and
they
that
believe
in
him
shall
be
saved
and
because
of
the
intercession
for
all
all
men
come
unto
god
wherefore
they
stand
in
the
presence
of
him
to
be
judged
of
him
according
to
the
truth
and
holiness
which
is
in
him
wherefore
the
ends
of
the
law
which
the
holy
one
hath
given
unto
the
inflicting
of
the
punishment
which
is
affixed
which
punishment
that
is
affixed
is
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
happiness
which
is
affixed
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
atonement
for
it
must
needs
be
that
there
is
an
opposition
in
all
things
if
not
so
my
in
the
wilderness
righteousness
could
not
be
brought
to
pass
neither
wickedness
neither
holiness
nor
misery
neither
good
nor
bad
wherefore
all
things
must
needs
be
a
compound
in
one
wherefore
if
it
should
be
one
body
it
must
needs
remain
as
dead
having
no
life
neither
death
nor
corruption
nor
incorruption
happiness
nor
misery
neither
sense
nor
insensibility
wherefore
it
must
needs
have
been
created
for
a
thing
of
naught
wherefore
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
in
the
end
of
its
creation
wherefore
this
thing
must
needs
destroy
the
wisdom
of
god
and
his
eternal
purposes
and
also
the
power
and
the
mercy
and
the
justice
of
god
and
if
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
law
ye
shall
also
say
there
is
no
sin
if
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
sin
ye
shall
also
say
there
is
no
righteousness
and
if
there
be
no
righteousness
there
be
no
happiness
and
if
there
be
no
righteousness
nor
happiness
there
be
no
punishment
nor
misery
and
if
these
things
are
not
there
is
no
god
and
if
there
is
no
god
we
are
not
neither
the
earth
for
there
could
have
been
no
creation
of
things
neither
to
act
nor
to
be
acted
upon
wherefore
all
things
must
have
vanished
away
and
now
my
sons
i
speak
unto
you
these
things
for
your
profit
and
learning
for
there
is
a
god
and
he
hath
created
all
things
both
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
things
that
in
them
is
both
things
to
act
and
things
to
be
acted
upon
and
to
bring
about
his
eternal
purposes
in
the
end
of
man
after
he
had
created
our
first
parents
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
in
fine
all
things
which
are
created
it
must
needs
be
that
there
was
an
opposition
even
the
forbidden
fruit
in
opposition
to
the
tree
of
life
the
one
being
sweet
and
the
other
bitter
wherefore
the
lord
god
gave
unto
man
that
he
should
act
for
himself
wherefore
man
could
not
act
for
himself
save
it
should
be
that
he
was
enticed
by
the
one
or
the
other
and
i
lehi
according
to
the
things
which
i
have
read
must
needs
suppose
that
an
angel
of
god
according
to
that
which
is
written
had
fallen
from
heaven
wherefore
he
became
a
devil
having
sought
that
which
was
evil
before
god
and
because
he
had
fallen
from
heaven
and
had
become
miserable
for
ever
he
sought
also
the
misery
of
all
mankind
wherefore
he
said
unto
eve
yea
even
that
old
serpent
who
is
the
devil
who
is
the
father
of
all
lies
wherefore
he
said
partake
of
the
forbidden
fruit
and
ye
shall
not
die
but
ye
shall
be
as
god
knowing
good
and
evil
and
after
adam
and
eve
had
partaken
of
the
forbidden
fruit
they
were
driven
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
earth
and
they
have
brought
forth
children
yea
even
the
family
of
all
the
earth
and
the
days
of
the
children
of
men
were
prolonged
according
to
the
will
of
god
that
they
might
repent
while
in
the
flesh
wherefore
their
state
became
a
state
of
probation
and
their
time
was
lengthened
according
to
the
commandments
which
the
lord
god
gave
unto
the
children
of
men
for
he
gave
commandment
that
all
men
must
repent
for
he
shewed
unto
all
men
that
they
were
lost
because
of
the
transgression
of
their
nephi
ii
and
now
my
brethren
i
have
spoken
plain
that
ye
can
not
err
and
as
the
lord
god
liveth
that
brought
israel
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
gave
unto
moses
power
that
he
should
heal
the
nations
after
they
had
been
bitten
by
the
poisonous
serpents
if
they
would
cast
their
eyes
unto
the
serpent
which
he
did
raise
up
before
them
and
also
gave
him
power
that
he
should
smite
the
rock
and
the
water
should
come
forth
yea
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
as
these
things
are
true
and
as
the
lord
god
liveth
there
is
none
other
name
given
under
heaven
save
it
be
this
jesus
christ
of
whom
i
have
spoken
whereby
man
can
be
saved
wherefore
for
this
cause
hath
the
lord
god
promised
unto
me
that
these
things
which
i
write
shall
be
kept
and
preserved
and
handed
down
unto
my
seed
from
generation
to
generation
that
the
promise
may
be
fulfilled
unto
joseph
that
his
seed
should
never
perish
as
long
as
the
earth
should
stand
wherefore
these
things
shall
go
from
generation
to
generation
as
long
as
the
earth
shall
stand
and
they
shall
go
according
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
god
and
the
nations
who
shall
possess
them
shall
be
judged
of
them
according
to
the
words
which
are
written
for
we
labor
diligently
to
write
to
persuade
our
children
and
also
our
brethren
to
believe
in
christ
and
to
be
reconciled
to
god
for
we
know
that
it
is
by
grace
that
we
are
saved
after
all
we
can
do
and
notwithstanding
we
believe
in
christ
we
keep
the
law
of
moses
and
look
forward
with
steadfastness
unto
christ
until
the
law
shall
be
fulfilled
for
for
this
end
was
the
law
given
wherefore
the
law
hath
become
dead
unto
us
and
we
are
made
alive
in
christ
because
of
our
faith
yet
we
keep
the
law
because
of
the
commandments
and
we
talk
of
christ
we
rejoice
in
christ
we
preach
of
christ
we
prophesy
of
christ
and
we
write
according
to
our
prophecies
that
our
children
may
know
to
what
source
they
may
look
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
wherefore
we
speak
concerning
the
law
that
our
children
may
know
the
deadness
of
the
law
and
they
by
knowing
the
deadness
of
the
law
may
look
forward
unto
that
life
which
is
in
christ
and
know
for
what
end
the
law
was
given
and
after
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
christ
that
they
need
not
harden
their
hearts
against
him
when
the
law
ought
to
be
done
away
nephi
xxv
the
reference
in
the
above
quotation
to
the
serpent
which
moses
raised
up
before
the
children
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
directly
confirms
the
statement
of
our
savior
and
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
even
so
must
the
son
of
man
be
lifted
up
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
john
iii
we
now
return
to
our
extracts
from
the
book
of
mormon
king
benjamin
teaches
for
behold
the
time
cometh
and
is
not
far
distant
that
with
power
the
lord
omnipotent
who
reigneth
who
was
and
is
from
all
eternity
to
all
eternity
shall
come
down
from
heaven
among
the
children
of
men
and
shall
dwell
in
a
tabernacle
of
clay
and
shall
go
forth
amongst
men
working
mighty
miracles
such
as
healing
the
sick
raising
the
dead
causing
the
lame
to
walk
the
blind
to
receive
their
sight
and
the
deaf
to
hear
and
curing
all
manner
of
diseases
and
he
shall
cast
out
devils
or
the
evil
spirits
which
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
and
lo
he
shall
suffer
temptations
and
pain
of
body
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
even
more
than
man
can
suffer
except
it
be
unto
death
for
behold
blood
cometh
from
every
pore
so
great
shall
be
his
anguish
for
the
wickedness
and
the
abominations
of
his
people
and
he
shall
be
called
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
the
father
of
heaven
and
earth
the
creator
of
all
things
from
the
beginning
and
his
mother
shall
be
called
mary
and
lo
he
cometh
unto
his
own
that
salvation
might
come
unto
the
children
of
men
even
through
faith
on
his
name
and
even
after
all
this
they
shall
consider
him
a
man
and
say
that
he
hath
a
devil
and
shall
scourge
him
and
shall
crucify
him
and
he
shall
rise
the
third
day
from
the
dead
and
behold
he
standeth
to
judge
the
world
and
behold
all
these
things
are
done
that
a
righteous
judgment
might
come
upon
the
children
of
men
for
behold
and
also
his
blood
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
those
who
have
fallen
by
the
transgression
of
adam
who
have
died
not
knowing
the
will
of
god
concerning
them
or
who
have
ignorantly
sinned
but
wo
wo
unto
him
who
knoweth
that
he
rebelleth
against
god
for
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
except
it
be
through
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
lord
god
hath
sent
his
holy
prophets
among
all
the
children
of
men
to
declare
these
things
to
every
kindred
nation
and
tongue
that
thereby
whosoever
should
believe
that
christ
should
come
the
same
might
receive
remission
of
their
sins
and
rejoice
with
exceeding
great
joy
even
as
though
he
had
already
come
among
them
yet
the
lord
god
saw
that
his
people
were
a
stiffnecked
people
and
he
appointed
unto
them
a
law
even
the
law
of
moses
and
many
signs
and
wonders
and
types
and
shadows
shewed
he
unto
them
concerning
his
coming
and
also
holy
prophets
spake
unto
them
concerning
his
coming
and
yet
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
understood
not
that
the
law
of
moses
availeth
nothing
except
it
were
through
the
atonement
of
his
blood
and
even
if
it
were
possible
that
little
children
could
sin
they
could
not
be
saved
but
i
say
unto
you
they
are
blessed
for
behold
as
in
adam
or
by
nature
they
fall
even
so
the
blood
of
christ
atoneth
for
their
sins
and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
there
shall
be
no
other
name
given
nor
any
other
way
nor
means
whereby
salvation
can
come
unto
the
children
of
men
only
in
and
through
the
name
of
christ
the
lord
omnipotent
for
behold
he
judgeth
and
his
judgment
is
just
and
the
infant
perisheth
not
that
dieth
in
his
infancy
but
men
drink
damnation
to
their
own
souls
except
they
humble
themselves
and
become
as
little
children
and
believe
that
salvation
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
in
and
through
the
atoning
blood
of
christ
the
lord
omnipotent
for
the
natural
man
is
an
enemy
to
god
and
has
been
from
the
fall
of
adam
and
will
be
for
ever
and
ever
but
if
he
yields
to
the
enticings
of
the
holy
spirit
and
putteth
off
the
natural
man
and
becometh
a
saint
through
the
atonement
of
christ
the
lord
and
becometh
as
a
child
submissive
meek
humble
patient
full
of
love
willing
to
submit
to
all
things
which
the
lord
seeth
fit
to
inflict
upon
him
even
as
a
child
doth
submit
to
his
father
and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
when
the
knowledge
of
a
savior
shall
spread
throughout
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
and
behold
when
that
time
cometh
none
shall
be
found
blameless
before
god
except
it
be
little
children
only
through
repentance
and
faith
on
the
name
of
the
lord
god
omnipotent
mosiah
iii
and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
which
had
been
delivered
unto
him
by
the
angel
of
the
lord
that
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
the
multitude
and
behold
they
had
fallen
to
the
earth
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
had
come
upon
them
and
they
had
viewed
themselves
in
their
own
carnal
state
even
less
than
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
they
all
cried
aloud
with
one
voice
saying
o
have
mercy
and
apply
the
atoning
blood
of
christ
that
we
may
receive
forgiveness
of
our
sins
and
our
hearts
may
be
purified
for
we
believe
in
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
who
created
heaven
and
earth
and
all
things
who
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
spoken
these
words
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
they
were
filled
with
joy
having
received
a
remission
of
their
sins
and
having
peace
of
conscience
because
of
the
exceeding
faith
which
they
had
in
jesus
christ
who
should
come
according
to
the
words
which
king
benjamin
had
spoken
unto
them
and
king
benjamin
again
opened
his
mouth
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
saying
my
friends
and
my
brethren
my
kindred
and
my
people
i
would
again
call
your
attention
that
ye
may
hear
and
understand
the
remainder
of
my
words
which
i
shall
speak
unto
you
for
behold
if
the
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
god
at
this
time
has
awakened
you
to
a
sense
of
your
nothingness
and
your
worthless
and
fallen
state
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
god
and
his
matchless
power
and
his
wisdom
and
his
patience
and
his
long
suffering
towards
the
children
of
men
and
also
the
atonement
which
has
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
that
thereby
salvation
might
come
to
him
that
should
put
his
trust
in
the
lord
and
should
be
diligent
in
keeping
his
commandments
and
continue
in
the
faith
even
unto
the
end
of
his
life
i
mean
the
life
of
the
mortal
body
i
say
that
this
is
the
man
who
receiveth
salvation
through
the
atonement
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
for
all
mankind
which
ever
were
since
the
fall
of
adam
or
who
are
or
whoever
shall
be
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
and
this
is
the
means
whereby
salvation
cometh
and
there
is
none
other
salvation
save
this
which
hath
been
spoken
of
neither
are
there
any
conditions
whereby
man
can
be
saved
except
the
conditions
which
i
have
told
you
mosiah
iv
and
now
abinadi
said
unto
them
i
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
god
himself
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
and
shall
redeem
his
people
and
because
he
dwelleth
in
flesh
he
shall
be
called
the
son
of
god
and
having
subjected
the
flesh
to
the
will
of
the
father
being
the
father
and
the
son
the
father
because
he
was
conceived
by
the
power
of
god
and
the
son
because
of
the
flesh
thus
becoming
the
father
and
son
and
they
are
one
god
yea
the
very
eternal
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
and
thus
the
flesh
becoming
subject
to
the
spirit
or
the
son
to
the
father
being
one
god
suffereth
temptation
and
yieldeth
not
to
the
temptation
but
suffereth
himself
to
be
mocked
and
scourged
and
cast
out
and
disowned
by
his
people
and
after
all
this
after
working
many
mighty
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
he
shall
be
led
yea
even
as
isaiah
said
as
a
sheep
before
the
shearer
is
dumb
so
he
opened
not
his
mouth
yea
even
so
he
shall
be
led
crucified
and
slain
the
flesh
becoming
subject
even
unto
death
the
will
of
the
son
being
swallowed
up
in
the
will
of
the
father
and
thus
god
breaketh
the
bands
of
death
having
gained
the
victory
over
death
giving
the
son
power
to
make
intercession
for
the
children
of
men
having
ascended
into
heaven
having
the
bowels
of
mercy
being
filled
with
compassion
towards
the
children
of
men
standing
betwixt
them
and
justice
having
broken
the
bands
of
death
taken
upon
himself
their
iniquity
and
their
transgressions
having
redeemed
them
and
satisfied
the
demands
of
justice
mosiah
xv
and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
said
the
time
shall
come
when
all
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
when
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
shall
see
eye
to
eye
and
shall
confess
before
god
that
his
judgments
are
just
and
then
shall
the
wicked
be
cast
out
and
they
shall
have
cause
to
howl
and
weep
and
wail
and
gnash
their
teeth
and
this
because
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
therefore
the
lord
redeemeth
them
not
for
they
are
carnal
and
devilish
and
the
devil
has
power
over
them
yea
even
that
old
serpent
that
did
beguile
our
first
parents
which
was
the
cause
of
their
fall
which
was
the
cause
of
all
mankind
becoming
carnal
sensual
devilish
knowing
evil
from
good
subjecting
themselves
to
the
devil
thus
all
mankind
were
lost
and
behold
they
would
have
been
endlessly
lost
were
it
not
that
god
redeemed
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state
but
remember
that
he
that
persists
in
his
own
carnal
nature
and
goes
on
in
the
ways
of
sin
and
rebellion
against
god
remaineth
in
his
fallen
state
and
the
devil
hath
all
power
over
him
therefore
he
is
as
though
there
was
no
redemption
made
being
an
enemy
to
god
and
also
is
the
devil
an
enemy
of
god
and
now
if
christ
had
not
come
into
the
world
speaking
of
things
to
come
as
though
they
had
already
come
there
could
have
been
no
redemption
and
if
christ
had
not
risen
from
the
dead
or
have
broken
the
bands
of
death
that
the
grave
should
have
no
victory
and
that
death
should
have
no
sting
there
could
have
been
no
resurrection
but
there
is
a
resurrection
therefore
the
grave
hath
no
victory
and
the
sting
of
death
is
swallowed
up
in
christ
he
is
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
world
yea
a
light
that
is
endless
that
can
never
be
darkened
yea
and
also
a
life
which
is
endless
that
there
can
be
no
more
death
even
this
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
and
this
corruption
shall
put
on
incorruption
and
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
the
bar
of
god
to
be
judged
of
him
according
to
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil
if
they
be
good
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
life
and
happiness
and
if
they
be
evil
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
damnation
being
delivered
up
to
the
devil
who
hath
subjected
them
which
is
damnation
having
gone
according
to
their
own
carnal
wills
and
desires
having
never
called
upon
the
lord
while
the
arms
of
mercy
were
extended
towards
them
for
the
arms
of
mercy
were
extended
towards
them
and
they
would
not
they
being
warned
of
their
iniquities
and
yet
they
would
not
depart
from
them
and
they
were
commanded
to
repent
and
yet
they
would
not
repent
and
now
had
ye
not
ought
to
tremble
and
repent
of
your
sins
and
remember
only
in
and
through
christ
ye
can
be
saved
therefore
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
also
teach
that
it
is
a
shadow
of
those
things
which
are
to
come
teach
them
that
redemption
cometh
through
christ
the
lord
who
is
the
very
eternal
father
amen
mosiah
xvi
but
behold
the
spirit
hath
said
this
much
unto
me
saying
cry
unto
this
people
saying
repent
ye
and
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
and
walk
in
his
paths
which
are
straight
for
behold
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
and
the
son
of
god
cometh
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
behold
he
shall
be
born
of
mary
at
jerusalem
which
is
the
land
of
our
forefathers
she
being
a
virgin
a
precious
and
chosen
vessel
who
shall
be
overshadowed
and
conceive
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
bring
forth
a
son
yea
even
the
son
of
god
and
he
shall
go
forth
suffering
pains
and
afflictions
and
temptations
of
every
kind
and
this
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
which
saith
he
will
take
upon
him
the
pains
and
the
sicknesses
of
his
people
and
he
will
take
upon
him
death
that
he
may
loose
the
bands
of
death
which
bind
his
people
and
he
will
take
upon
him
their
infirmities
that
his
bowels
may
be
filled
with
mercy
according
to
the
flesh
that
he
may
know
according
to
the
flesh
how
to
succor
his
people
according
to
their
infirmities
now
the
spirit
knoweth
all
things
nevertheless
the
son
of
god
suffereth
according
to
the
flesh
that
he
might
take
upon
him
the
sins
of
his
people
that
he
might
blot
out
their
transgressions
according
to
the
power
of
his
deliverance
and
now
behold
this
is
the
testimony
which
is
in
me
alma
vii
now
zeezrom
said
unto
the
people
see
that
ye
remember
these
things
for
he
said
there
is
but
one
god
yet
he
saith
that
the
son
of
god
shall
come
but
he
shall
not
save
his
people
as
though
he
had
authority
to
command
god
now
amulek
saith
again
unto
him
behold
thou
hast
lied
for
thou
sayest
that
i
spake
as
though
i
had
authority
to
command
god
because
i
said
he
shall
not
save
his
people
in
their
sins
and
i
say
unto
you
again
that
he
can
not
save
them
in
their
sins
for
i
can
not
deny
his
word
and
he
hath
said
that
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
how
can
ye
be
saved
except
ye
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
ye
can
not
be
saved
in
your
sins
now
zeezrom
saith
again
unto
him
is
the
son
of
god
the
very
eternal
father
and
amulek
said
unto
him
yea
he
is
the
very
eternal
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
and
all
things
which
in
them
is
he
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
first
and
the
last
and
he
shall
come
into
the
world
to
redeem
his
people
and
he
shall
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
those
who
believe
on
his
name
and
these
are
they
that
shall
have
eternal
life
and
salvation
cometh
to
none
else
therefore
the
wicked
remain
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemption
made
except
it
be
the
loosing
of
the
bands
of
death
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
and
stand
before
god
and
be
judged
according
to
their
works
now
there
is
a
death
which
is
called
a
temporal
death
and
the
death
of
christ
shall
loose
the
bands
of
this
temporal
death
that
all
shall
be
raised
from
this
temporal
death
the
spirit
and
the
body
shall
be
again
in
its
perfect
form
both
limb
and
joint
shall
be
restored
to
its
proper
frame
even
as
we
now
are
at
this
time
and
we
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
god
knowing
even
as
we
know
now
and
have
a
bright
recollection
of
all
our
guilt
now
this
restoration
shall
come
to
all
both
old
and
young
both
bond
and
free
both
male
and
female
both
the
wicked
and
the
righteous
and
even
there
shall
not
so
much
as
a
hair
of
their
heads
be
lost
but
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
its
perfect
frame
as
it
is
now
or
in
the
body
and
shall
be
brought
and
be
arraigned
before
the
bar
of
christ
the
son
and
god
the
father
and
the
holy
spirit
which
is
one
eternal
god
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil
alma
xi
now
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
must
repent
and
be
born
again
for
the
spirit
saith
if
ye
are
not
born
again
ye
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
come
and
be
baptized
unto
repentance
that
ye
may
be
washed
from
your
sins
that
ye
may
have
faith
on
the
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
who
is
mighty
to
save
and
to
cleanse
from
all
unrighteousness
alma
vii
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
look
and
i
looked
and
beheld
three
generations
pass
away
in
righteousness
and
their
garments
were
white
even
like
unto
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
these
are
made
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
because
of
their
faith
in
him
nephi
xii
therefore
they
were
called
after
this
holy
order
and
were
sanctified
and
their
garments
were
washed
white
through
the
blood
of
the
lamb
alma
xiii
and
this
i
know
because
the
lord
hath
said
he
dwelleth
not
in
unholy
temples
but
in
the
hearts
of
the
righteous
doth
he
dwell
yea
and
he
has
also
said
that
the
righteous
shall
sit
down
in
his
kingdom
to
go
no
more
out
but
their
garments
should
be
made
white
through
the
blood
of
the
lamb
alma

o
then
ye
unbelieving
turn
ye
unto
the
lord
cry
mightily
unto
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus
that
perhaps
ye
may
be
found
spotless
pure
fair
and
white
having
been
cleansed
by
the
blood
of
the

for
behold
he
must
surely
die
that
salvation
may

it

he
dieth
to
bring
to

the

that
thereby

may
be

behold
the

redeemeth
mankind
yea
even
all
mankind
and
bringeth
them
back

forth
unto

ye

thrust
your

into

that
ye
may
feel
the

in

behold
he
created

by

came
the
fall

because
of
the
fall

came
jesus

even
the

came
the

came
by

they
are
brought

death
is
a

then
cometh
the
judgment

holy
one

cometh
the
time

from

he
received
not
of

continued
from

received

occupy
chapter

introduction
to
the
historical
portion
of
this
treatise
the
dealings
of
god
with
adam
cain
and
abel
the
institution
of
sacrifice
the
symbolism
of
this
rite
the
words
of
the
angel
to
adam
lucifer
his
rebellion
in
heaven
his
conflict
with
michael
for
the
body
of
moses
he
tempts
christ
he
is
cast
into
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
having
thus
gathered
in
one
numerous
testimonies
from
the
writings
of
the
ancient
inspired
servants
of
god
who
dwelt
on
either
hemisphere
and
joined
therewith
extracts
from
the
revelations
of
the
present
dispensation
with
regard
to
the
mission
lifework
and
death
of
the
only
begotten
son
we
shall
now
proceed
to
trace
from
the
sacred
volumes
the
revelation
of
our
savior
and
the
prophecy
of
his
advent
from
the
earliest
ages
of
recorded
history
until
he
fulfilled
in
himself
all
even
all
that
as
offering
sacrifice
sacrament
vision
or
prophetic
word
had
foreshadowed
his
appearing
or
typified
the
mystery
of
his
blood
we
shall
commence
this
portion
of
our
subject
by
showing
that
sacrifices
have
been
offered
from
the
very
earliest
times
and
that
when
performed
under
divine
instruction
they
prefigured
and
typified
the
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
and
that
it
was
with
this
view
these
sacrifices
were
offered
up
it
is
recorded
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
the
book
of
genesis
that
adam
knew
eve
his
wife
and
she
conceived
and
bare
cain
and
said
i
have
gotten
a
man
from
the
lord
and
she
again
bare
his
brother
abel
and
abel
was
a
keeper
of
sheep
but
cain
was
a
tiller
of
the
ground
and
in
process
of
time
it
came
to
pass
that
cain
brought
of
the
fruit
of
ground
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
abel
he
also
brought
of
the
firstings
of
his
flock
and
of
the
fat
thereof
and
the
lord
had
respect
unto
abel
and
to
his
offering
but
unto
cain
and
to
his
offering
he
had
not
respect
genesis
iv
as
these
sayings
found
in
king
james
translation
of
the
bible
are
very
limited
and
somewhat
obscure
we
will
here
refer
as
a
starting
point
on
this
subject
to
the
account
given
of
these
events
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
which
is
a
selection
from
the
revelations
translations
and
narrations
of
joseph
smith
the
prophet
seer
and
revelator
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
for
in
that
translation
it
is
stated
that
adam
previous
to
these
acts
of
abel
and
cain
offered
up
a
sacrifice
by
the
direct
command
of
god
it
is
there
written
that
the
lord
gave
unto
adam
and
eve
commandments
that
they
should
worship
the
lord
their
god
and
should
offer
the
firstlings
of
their
flocks
for
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
adam
was
obedient
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
after
many
days
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
adam
saying
why
dost
thou
offer
sacrifices
unto
the
lord
and
adam
said
unto
him
i
know
not
save
the
lord
commanded
me
and
then
the
angel
spake
saying
this
thing
is
a
similitude
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
which
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
wherefore
thou
shalt
do
all
that
thou
doest
in
the
name
of
the
son
and
thou
shalt
repent
and
call
upon
god
in
the
name
of
the
son
for
evermore
we
are
further
informed
that
adam
and
eve
blessed
the
name
of
god
and
they
made
all
things
known
unto
their
sons
and
their
daughters
from
the
above
it
would
seem
that
adam
until
instructed
by
the
angel
did
not
know
the
reasons
for
the
offering
up
of
sacrifices
nor
the
object
that
the
lord
had
in
view
in
requiring
this
offering
at
his
hands
for
being
asked
by
the
angel
why
he
performed
this
rite
he
said
i
know
not
save
the
lord
commanded
me
and
the
object
of
the
visit
of
this
holy
being
to
adam
evidently
was
to
show
him
why
he
was
called
to
offer
a
sacrifice
to
the
lord
as
on
adam
expressing
his
ignorance
of
the
intent
of
this
offering
the
angel
stated
very
explicitly
that
this
thing
was
a
similitude
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
we
have
here
given
a
reason
why
adam
offered
up
this
sacrifice
we
may
hereafter
explain
why
it
was
necessary
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
should
be
made
these
sacrifices
which
were
similitudes
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
only
begotten
were
continued
from
that
time
until
as
is
stated
in
the
scriptures
jesus
came
to
offer
his
own
body
once
for
all
x
we
will
now
return
to
the
sacrifices
offered
by
cain
and
abel
and
give
the
statement
in
relation
thereto
contained
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
it
is
as
follows
and
cain
loved
satan
more
than
god
and
satan
commanded
him
saying
make
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
in
process
of
time
it
came
to
pass
that
cain
brought
of
the
fruits
of
the
ground
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
abel
he
also
brought
of
the
firstlings
of
his
flock
and
of
the
fat
thereof
and
the
lord
had
respect
unto
abel
and
to
his
offering
but
unto
cain
and
to
his
offering
he
had
not
respect
now
satan
knew
this
and
it
pleased
him
and
cain
was
very
wroth
and
his
countenance
fell
and
the
lord
said
unto
cain
why
art
thou
wroth
why
is
thy
countenance
fallen
if
thou
doest
well
thou
shalt
be
accepted
and
if
thou
doest
not
well
sin
lieth
at
the
door
and
satan
desireth
to
have
thee
and
except
thou
shalt
hearken
unto
my
commandments
i
will
deliver
thee
up
and
it
shall
be
unto
thee
according
to
his
desire
and
thou
shalt
rule
over
him
for
from
this
time
forth
thou
shalt
be
the
father
of
his
lies
thou
shalt
be
called
perdition
for
thou
wast
also
before
the
world
and
it
shall
be
said
in
time
to
come
that
these
abominations
were
had
from
cain
for
he
rejected
the
greater
counsel
which
was
had
from
god
and
this
is
a
cursing
which
i
will
put
upon
thee
except
thou
repent
and
cain
was
wroth
and
listened
not
any
more
to
the
voice
of
the
lord
neither
to
abel
his
brother
who
walked
in
holiness
before
the
lord
from
the
above
it
would
appear
that
satan
or
lucifer
was
also
before
the
world
and
that
the
term
also
refers
to
another
personage
and
that
personage
was
the
messiah
the
christ
the
well
beloved
son
who
we
are
told
was
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
it
is
obvious
that
lucifer
who
is
elsewhere
called
the
son
of
the
morning
had
an
important
role
to
play
upon
the
earth
as
well
as
the
messiah
and
that
he
occupied
a
very
prominent
position
before
the
world
was
and
still
occupies
that
position
in
opposition
to
his
heavenly
father
to
the
son
of
god
and
to
the
interests
of
humanity
which
opposition
will
continue
we
are
informed
until
he
shall
not
only
be
bound
but
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
as
stated
by
the
apostle
john
in
the
book
of
revelations
and
i
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand
and
he
laid
hold
on
the
dragon
that
old
serpent
which
is
the
devil
and
satan
and
bound
him
a
thousand
years
and
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit
and
shut
him
up
and
set
a
seal
upon
him
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
more
till
the
thousand
years
should
be
fulfilled
and
after
that
he
must
be
loosed
a
little
season
xx
and
a
little
further
on
we
read
that
after
the
thousand
years
have
passed
satan
shall
be
loosed
out
of
his
prison
and
shall
go
out
to
deceive
the
nations
and
gather
them
to
battle
against
the
saints
when
fire
from
heaven
will
devour
them
and
the
devil
that
deceived
them
was
cast
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
where
the
beast
and
the
false
prophet
are
and
shall
be
tormented
day
and
night
for
ever
and
ever
xx
the
operations
of
satan
in
opposition
to
the
designs
and
purposes
of
god
are
frequently
noticed
in
holy
writ
reference
has
already
been
made
to
his
control
over
cain
and
the
results
thereof
and
unfortunately
for
them
cain
was
not
the
only
one
in
that
early
age
of
the
world
history
over
whom
satan
gained
the
mastery
for
he
went
abroad
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
saying
i
am
also
a
son
of
god
and
they
loved
satan
more
than
god
and
men
began
from
that
time
forth
to
be
carnal
sensual
and
devilish
and
so
they
continued
increasing
in
wickedness
until
all
flesh
had
corrupted
its
way
upon
the
earth
and
the
waters
of
the
flood
had
to
accomplish
the
work
which
the
preaching
of
noah
could
not
effect
in
later
years
we
hear
of
satan
contending
with
the
archangel
michael
for
the
body
of
moses
jude
writes
yet
michael
the
archangel
when
contending
with
the
devil
he
disputed
about
the
body
of
moses
durst
not
bring
against
him
a
railing
accusation
but
said
the
lord
rebuke
thee
this
is
again
exhibited
in
the
part
he
took
in
tempting
the
savior
after
his
baptism
and
recognition
by
his
heavenly
father
of
this
event
it
is
written
then
was
jesus
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
and
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
nights
he
was
afterward
an
hungered
and
when
the
tempter
came
to
him
he
said
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
command
that
these
stones
be
made
bread
but
he
answered
and
said
it
is
written
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
then
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
the
holy
city
and
setteth
him
on
a
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
saith
unto
him
if
thou
be
the
son
of
god
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
concerning
thee
and
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
thee
up
lest
at
any
time
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
jesus
said
unto
him
it
is
written
again
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the
lord
thy
god
again
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
showeth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the

and
the
glory
of
them
and
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
will

then
saith
jesus
unto

get
thee
hence
satan
for
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the

thy
god
and
him
only
shalt
thou
serve
then
the
devil
leaveth
him
and
behold
angels
came
and
ministered
unto
him
iv
or
to
give
the
words
of
the
inspired
translation
then
jesus
was
led
up
of
the
spirit
into
the
wilderness
to
be
with
god
and
when
he
had
fasted
forty
days
and
forty
nights
and
had
communed
with
god
he
was
afterwards
an
hungered
and
was
left
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
and
when
the
tempter
came
to
him
he
said
if
thou
be
the
son
of

command
that
these

be

but
jesus
answered
and
said
it
is

by

was
taken
up
into

jesus
said
unto
him
it
is
written
again
thou
shalt
not
tempt
the

thy

and
again
jesus
was
in
the
spirit
and
it
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
showed
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of

and
the

came
unto
him
again
and
said
all

the

leaveth
him
again
john
in
the
revelations
when
referring
to
the
latter
days
exclaims
wo
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
down
unto
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
he
hath
but
a
short
time
xii
and
by
and
by
the
same
writer
tells
us
in
a
passage
already
quoted
that
satan
time
is
finished
and
he
is
bound
and
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
chapter
viii
seth
his
sacrifice
accepted
rebellion
in
the
heavens
the
gathering
of
the
patriarchs
in
the
valley
of
sacrifices
offered
there
the
next
eminent
personage
that
appears
is
seth
concerning
him
it
is
said
in
the
old
testament
and
adam
knew
his
wife
again
and
she
bare
a
son
and
called
his
name
seth
for
god
said
she
hath
appointed
me
another
seed
instead
of
abel
whom
cain
slew
iv
there
is
a
principle
developed
here
pertaining
to
the
economy
of
god
with
the
human
family
abel
held
a
representative
position
as
also
did
cain
and
that
position
it
would
seem
associated
abel
with
what
may
be
denominated
the
chosen
seed
cain
slew
abel
but
that
the
purposes
relating
to
the
perpetuation
of
that
seed
might
stand
and
the
plan
of
god
not
be
frustrated
by
the
adversary
he
gave
to
adam
seth
who
inherited
the
priesthood
and
promises
of
his
martyred
brother
in
this
substantiating
a
principle
that
paul
refers
to
when
he
writes
that
the
purpose
of
god
according
to
election
might
stand
not
of
works
but
of
him
that
calleth
ix
yet
although
seth
was
one
of
the
leading
characters
spoken
of
in
the
scripture
and
one
to
whom
and
through
whom
the
promises
were
made
and
who
actually
stood
in
the
place
of
or
represented
his
brother
abel
yet
there
is
nothing
said
in
the
ordinary
translation
pertaining
to
his
offering
sacrifices
we
therefore
again
refer
to
the
pearl
of
great
price
it
is
there
stated
that
adam
glorified
the
name
of
god
for
he
said
god
hath
appointed
me
another
seed
instead
of
abel
whom
cain
slew
and
god
revealed
himself
unto
seth
and
he
rebelled
not
but
offered
an
acceptable
sacrifice
like
unto
his
brother
abel
seth
we
are
here
told
rebelled
not
but
offered
an
acceptable
sacrifice
thus
carrying
out
the
same
idea
of
the
atonement
of
the
only
begotten
in
this
connection
we
must
remember
that
there
had
been
a
rebellion
in
heaven
and
many
of
the
angels
they
which
kept
not
their
first
estate
jude
were
cast
out
lucifer
was
the
leader
of
these
rebellious
ones
who
were
then
cast
down
to
the
earth
he
had
rebelled
against
god
his
father
and
it
would
seem
from
revelations
that
we
shall
hereafter
draw
attention
to
that
his
rebellion
had
its
origin
in
his
rejection
of
the
counsel
given
to
him
by
his
father
pertaining
to
the
salvation
and
exaltation
of
mankind
when
man
was
placed
upon
the
earth
lucifer
or
satan
still
manifested
the
same
animus
and
spirit
and
through
his
influence
he
operated
upon
cain
for
cain
listened
to
his
wiles
and
being
controlled
by
him
he
also
rebelled
against
his
father
and
his
god
thus
the
rebellion
in
the
heavens
was
transmitted
to
a
rebellion
on
the
earth
and
all
who
became
subject
to
this
influence
placed
themselves
in
a
state
of
enmity
and
antagonism
to
god
and
one
of
the
first
results
exhibited
was
covetousness
and
murder
even
the
murder
by
cain
of
his
brother
abel
thus
we
find
the
first
man
slain
abel
was
one
holding
the
holy
priesthood
and
the
same
vindictive
spirit
manifested
against
the
servants
of
god
of
all
later
ages
gave
the
martyr
stephen
good
reason
to
ask
his
persecutors
which
of
the
prophets
have
not
your
fathers
persecuted
and
they
have
slain
them
which
showed
before
of
the
coming
of
the
just
one
of
whom
ye
have
been
now
the
betrayers
and
murderers
acts
vii
although
there
is
nothing
said
in
the
book
of
genesis
in
relation
to
sacrifices
offered
up
by
enos
who
was
the
son
of
seth
nor
by
his
descendants
canaan
mahalaleel
jared
enoch
and
methuselah
all
of
whom
held
the
high
priesthood
and
were
consequently
prophets
of
the
lord
yet
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
being
of
the
promised
seed
through
whom
the
messiah
was
to
come
did
offer
up
sacrifices
as
commemorative
of
that
great
promised
event
further
in
relation
to
this
subject
we
are
informed
in
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
section
par
that
three
years
previous
to
the
death
of
adam
he
called
seth
enos
cainan
mahalaleel
and
methuselah
the
persons
mentioned
above
who
were
all
high
priests
with
the
residue
of
his
posterity
who
were
righteous
into
the
valley
of
and
there
bestowed
upon
them
his
last
blessing
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
them
and
they
rose
up
and
blessed
adam
and
called
him
michael
the
prince
the
archangel
and
the
lord
administered
comfort
unto
adam
and
said
unto
him
i
have
set
thee
to
be
at
the
head
a
multitude
of
nations
shall
come
of
thee
and
thou
art
a
prince
over
them
for
ever
and
adam
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
congregation
and
notwithstanding
he
was
bowed
down
with
age
being
full
of
the
holy
ghost
predicted
whatsoever
should
befall
his
posterity
unto
the
latest
generation
these
things
were
all
written
in
the
book
of
enoch
and
are
to
be
testified
of
in
due
time
although
in
the
above
there
is
nothing
directly
said
about
the
offering
of
sacrifices
yet
as
this
was
a
usual
ceremony
and
it
belonged
to
the
priesthood
and
to
the
promised
seed
to
offer
sacrifices
it
would
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
adam
did
then
and
there
officiate
in
that
rite
indeed
it
was
stated
by
the
prophet
joseph
smith
in
our
hearing
while
standing
on
an
elevated
piece
of
ground
or
plateau
near
a
davis
missouri
where
there
were
a
number
of
rocks
piled
together
that
the
valley
before
us
was
the
valley
of
or
in
other
words
the
valley
where
god
talked
with
adam
and
where
he
gathered
his
righteous
posterity
as
recorded
in
the
above
revelation
and
that
this
pile
of
stones
was
an
altar
built
by
him
when
he
offered
up
sacrifices
as
we
understand
on
that
occasion
if
adam
then
offered
up
sacrifices
in
the
presence
of
these
prominent
men
he
being
the
president
of
these
high
priests
he
would
officiate
for
them
as
well
as
for
himself
while
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
believe
that
they
assisted
in
the
offerings
made
upon
that
altar
regarding
this
the
saints
sing
footnote
a
revelation
to
joseph

near
ferry
at
a
place
called
spring

davis
county
missouri
may
wherein
spring
hill
is
named
by
the
lord
because
said
he
it
is
the
place
where
adam
shall
come
to
visit
his
people
or
the
ancient
of
days
shall
sit
as
spoken
of
by
daniel
the
doc
and
cov
sec
p
this
earth
was
once
a
garden
place
with
all
her
glories
common
and
men
did
live
a
holy
race
and
worship

we
next
come
to
enoch
who
presents
a
very
important
figure
among
the
antediluvians
and
of
whom
there
are
some
very
marvelous
things
related
the
bible
record
of
him
is
as
follows
and
jared
lived
an
hundred
sixty
and
two
years
and
he
begat
enoch
and
enoch
lived
sixty
and
five
years
and
begat
methuselah
and
enoch
walked
with
god
after
he
begat
methuselah
three
hundred
years
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
all
the
days
of
enoch
were
three
hundred
sixty
and
five
years
and
enoch
walked
with
god
and
he
was
not
for
god
took
him
v
this
is
certainly
a
very
meagre
history
of
so
great
a
personage
and
to
supply
the
deficiency
we
must
have
recourse
to
other
testimonies
one
important
fact
however
is
here
stated
that
he
walked
with
god
another
is
that
god
took
him
there
was
evidently
a
book
written
by
this
patriarch
which
is
called
the
book
of
enoch
for
jude
says
and
enoch
also
the
seventh
from
adam
prophesied
of
these
saying
behold
the
lord
cometh
with
ten
thousand
of
his
saints
to
execute
judgment
upon
all
and
to
convince
all
that
are
ungodly
among
them
of
all
their
ungodly
deeds
which
they
have
ungodly
committed
and
of
all
their
hard
speeches
which
ungodly
sinners
have
spoken
against
him
jude
i
from
the
above
it
would
seem
that
not
only
had
enoch
written
a
book
but
that
jude
had
access
to
it
or
if
not
had
had
a
communication
or
revelation
from
enoch
as
referred
to
by
joseph
smith
hereafter
for
we
discover
that
he
had
a
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
the
messiah
it
is
true
the
only
begotten
as
he
is
spoken
of
elsewhere
is
not
here
mentioned
but
only
the
lord
is
referred
to
yet
the
circumstances
connected
therewith
are
indicative
of
it
being
that
personage
for
paul
expresses
the
same
sentiment
in
regard
to
the
second
coming
of
the
messiah
and
says
and
to
you
who
are
troubled
rest
with
us
when
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
revealed
from
heaven
with
his
mighty
angels
in
flaming
fire
taking
vengeance
on
them
that
know
not
god
and
that
obey
not
the
gospel
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
shall
be
punished
with
everlasting
destruction
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
from
the
glory
of
his
power
when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in
his
saints
and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed
in
that
day
i
moreover
jesus
himself
makes
the
following
remarks
concerning
the
same
subject
when
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
glory
and
all
the
holy
angels
with
him
then
shall
he
sit
upon
the
throne
of
his
glory
and
before
him
shall
be
gathered
all
nations
and
he
shall
separate
them
one
from
another
as
a
shepherd
divideth
his
sheep
from
the
goats
xxv
thus
showing
that
it
was
the
same
personage
that
was
referred
to
by
enoch
paul
in
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
writes
by
faith
enoch
was
translated
that
he
should
not
see
death
and
was
not
found
because
god
had
translated
him
for
before
his
translation
he
had
this
testimony
that
he
pleased
god
xi
these
declarations
are
very
strongly
corroborated
by
the
following
extracts
from
a
revelation
given
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
relating
to
the
prophecy
of
enoch
and
published
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
and
from
that
time
forth
enoch
began
to
prophesy
saying
unto
the
people
that
as
i
was
journeying
and
stood
in
the
place
mahujah
and
cried
unto
the
lord
there
came
a
voice
out
of
heaven
saying
turn
ye
and
get
ye
upon
the
mount
simeon
and
it
came
to
pass
that
i
turned
and
went
up
on
the
mount
and
as
i
stood
upon
the
mount
i
beheld
the
heavens
open
and
i
was
clothed
upon
with
glory
and
i
saw
the
lord
and
he
stood
before
my
face
and
he
talked
with
me
even
as
a
man
talketh
one
with
another
face
to
face
and
he
said
unto
me
look
and
i
will
show
unto
thee
the
world
for
the
space
of
many
generations
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
forth
to
this
people
and
say
unto
them
repent
lest
i
come
out
and
smite
them
with
a
curse
and
they
die
and
he
gave
unto
me
a
commandment
that
i
should
baptize
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
who
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
and
the
holy
ghost
which
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
the
son
and
it
came
to
pass
that
enoch
continued
to
call
upon
all
the
people
save
it
were
the
people
of
cainan
to
repent
and
so
great
was
the
faith
of
enoch
that
he
led
the
people
of
god
and
their
enemies
came
to
battle
against
them
and
he
spake
the
word
of
the
lord
and
the
earth
trembled
and
the
mountains
fled
even
according
to
his
command
and
the
rivers
of
water
were
turned
out
of
their
course
and
the
roar
of
the
lions
was
heard
out
of
the
wilderness
and
all
nations
feared
greatly
and
there
went
forth
a
curse
upon
all
the
people
who
fought
against
god
and
from
that
time
forth
there
were
wars
and
bloodshed
among
them
but
the
lord
came
and
dwelt
with
his
people
and
they
dwelt
in
righteousness
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
was
upon
all
nations
so
great
was
the
glory
of
the
lord
which
was
upon
his
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
enoch
talked
with
the
lord
and
he
said
unto
the
lord
surely
zion
shall
dwell
in
safety
for
ever
but
the
lord
said
unto
enoch
zion
have
i
blessed
but
the
residue
of
the
people
have
i
cursed
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
showed
unto
enoch
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
he
beheld
and
lo
zion
in
process
of
time
was
taken
up
into
heaven
and
the
lord
said
unto
enoch
behold
mine
abode
for
ever
the
prophet
joseph
smith
when
speaking
of
enoch
and
his
people
and
the
doctrine
of
translation
said
if
cain
had
fulfilled
the
law
of
righteousness
as
did
enoch
he
would
have
walked
with
god
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
never
failed
of
a
blessing
v
enoch
walked
with
god
after
he
begat
methuselah
three
hundred
years
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
and
all
the
days
of
enoch
were
three
hundred
and
years
and
enoch
walked
with
god
and
he
was
not
for
god
took
him
now
this
enoch
god
reserved
unto
himself
that
he
should
not
die
at
that
time
and
appointed
unto
him
a
ministry
unto
terrestrial
bodies
of
whom
there
has
been
but
little
revealed
he
is
reserved
also
unto
the
presidency
of
a
dispensation
and
more
shall
be
said
of
him
and
terrestrial
bodies
in
another
treatise
he
is
a
ministering
angel
to
minister
to
those
who
shall
be
heirs
of
salvation
and
appeared
unto
jude
as
abel
did
unto
paul
therefore
jude
spoke
of
him
and
verses
enoch
the
seventh
from
adam
revealed
these
sayings
behold
the
lord
cometh
with
ten
thousand
of
his
saints
paul
was
also
acquainted
with
this
character
and
received
instructions
from
him
xi
faith
enoch
was
translated
that
he
should
not
see
death
and
was
not
found
because
god
had
translated
him
for
before
his
translation
he
had
this
testimony
that
he
pleased
god
but
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
him
for
he
that
cometh
to
god
must
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
a
revealer
to
those
who
diligently
seek
him
now
the
doctrine
of
translation
is
a
power
which
belongs
to
this
priesthood
there
are
many
things
which
belong
to
the
powers
of
the
priesthood
and
the
keys
thereof
that
have
been
kept
hid
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
they
are
hid
from
the
wise
and
prudent
to
be
revealed
in
the
last
times
many
may
have
supposed
that
the
doctrine
of
translation
was
a
doctrine
whereby
men
were
taken
immediately
into
the
presence
of
god
and
into
an
eternal
fulness
but
this
is
a
mistaken
idea
their
place
of
habitation
is
that
of
the
terrestrial
order
and
a
place
prepared
for
such
characters
he
held
in
reserve
to
be
ministering
angels
unto
many
planets
and
who
as
yet
have
not
entered
into
so
great
a
fulness
as
those
who
are
resurrected
from
the
dead
see
xi
part
of
verse
were
tortured
not
accepting
deliverance
that
they
might
obtain
a
better
resurrection
now
it
is
evident
that
there
was
a
better
resurrection
or
else
god
would
not
have
revealed
it
unto
paul
wherein
then
can
it
be
said
a
better
resurrection
this
distinction
is
made
between
the
doctrine
of
the
actual
resurrection
and
translation
translation
obtains
deliverance
from
the
tortures
and
sufferings
of
the
body
but
their
existence
will
prolong
as
to
the
labors
and
toils
of
the
ministry
before
they
can
enter
into
so
great
a
rest
and
glory
on
the
other
hand
those
who
were

the
present

it
would
appear
that
the
translated
residents
of

city
are
under
the
direction
of
jesus
who
is
the
creator
of
worlds
and
that
he

could
in

select
the

perform
a

as

they
could
be

holds
the
authority
we
read
in
the
times

truly
jesus
christ
created
the
worlds
and
is
lord
of
lords
and
as
the
psalmist
said
among
the
gods
then
moses
might
have
said
with
propriety
he
is
the
god
and
christ
speaking
of
the
flesh
could
say
i
am
the
son
of
man
and
peter
enlightened
by
the
holy
ghost
thou
art
the
son
of
the
living
god
meaning
our
father
in
heaven
and
who
with
jesus
christ
his
first
begotten
son
and
the
holy
ghost
are
one
in
power
one
in
dominion
and
one
in
glory
constituting

again
the

are
governed
by
the
same
rules
and
destined
to
the

honor
book

and
page
par
a
for
i
will
liken
these
kingdoms
unto
a
man
having
a
field
and
he
sent
forth
his
servants
into
the
field
to
dig
in
the
field
and
he
said
unto
the
first
go
ye
and
labor
in
the
field
and
in
the
first
hour
i
will
come
unto
you
and
ye
shall
behold
the
joy
of
my
countenance
and
he
said
unto
the
second
go
ye
also
into
the
field
and
in
the
second
hour
i
will
visit
you
with
the
joy
of
my
countenance
and
also
unto
the
third
saying
i
will
visit
you
and
unto
the
fourth
and
so
on
unto
the
twelfth
footnote
a
page
new
edition
it
is
further
stated
in
this
section
therefore
unto
this
parable
will
i
liken
all
these
kingdoms
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
every
kingdom
in
its
hour
and
in
its
time
and
in
its
season
even
according
to
the
decree
which
god
hath
made
verse
that
is
each
kingdom
or
planet
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
blessed
with
the
visits
and
presence
of
their
creator
in
their
several
times
and
seasons
it
is
recorded
that
to
jesus
has
been
given
all
power
in
heaven
and
in
earth
and
from
the
foregoing
quotations
he
evidently
had
power
which
he
used
to
commission
the
citizens
of
the
zion
of
enoch
to
go
to
other
worlds
on
missions
in
an
extract
from
the
teachings
of
the
prophet
joseph
elsewhere
inserted
it
is
written
elijah
was
the
last
prophet
that
held
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
and
who
will
before
the
last
dispensation
restore
the
authority
and
deliver
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
in
order
that
all
the
ordinances
may
be
attended
to
in
righteousness
it
is
true
that
the
savior
had
authority
and
power
to
bestow
this
blessing
but
the
sons
of
levi
were
too
prejudiced
here
jesus
paid
deference
to
the
priesthood
who
held
keys
relating
to
the
ministration
of
its
powers
and
blessings
but
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
when
other
worlds
are
concerned
over
whom
also
he
holds
the
keys
of
salvation
that
these
considerations
would
not
necessarily
interpose
and
that
he
would
send
or
commission
members
of
the
translated
priesthood
of
enoch
zion
amongst
terrestrial
worlds
whithersoever
it
pleased
him
in
the
interests
of
the
peoples
thus
situated
we
now
resume
our
extracts
from
the
prophecy
of
enoch
and
enoch
beheld
angels
descending
out
of
heaven
bearing
testimony
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
fell
on
many
and
they
were
caught
up
by
the
power
of
heaven
into
zion
and
it
came
to
pass
that
enoch
looked
and
from
noah
he
beheld
all
the
families
of
the
earth
and
he
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
when
shall
the
day
of
the
lord
come
when
shall
the
blood
of
the
righteous
be
shed
that
all
they
that
mourn
may
be
sanctified
and
have
eternal
life
and
the
lord
said
it
shall
be
in
the
meridian
of
time
in
the
days
of
wickedness
and
vengeance
and
behold
enoch
saw
the
day
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
even
in
the
flesh
and
his
soul
rejoiced
saying
the
righteous
is
lifted
up
and
the
lamb
is
slain
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
through
faith
i
am
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
and
behold
zion
is
with
me
enoch
continued
his
cry
unto
the
lord
saying
i
ask
thee
o
lord
in
the
name
of
thine
only
begotten
even
jesus
christ
that
thou
wilt
have
mercy
upon
noah
and
his
seed
that
the
earth
might
never
more
be
covered
by
the
floods
and
the
lord
could
not
withhold
and
he
covenanted
with
enoch
and
sware
unto
him
with
an
oath
that
he
would
stay
the
floods
that
he
would
call
upon
the
children
of
noah
and
he
sent
forth
an
unalterable
decree
that
a
remnant
of
his
seed
should
always
be
found
among
all
nations
while
the
earth
should
stand
and
the
lord
said
blessed
is
he
through
whose
seed
messiah
shall
come
for
he
saith
i
am
messiah
the
king
of
zion
the
rock
of
heaven
which
is
broad
as
eternity
and
whoso
cometh
in
at
the
gate
and
climbeth
up
by
me
shall
never
fall
and
the
lord
said
unto
enoch
look
and
he
looked
and
beheld
the
son
of
man
lifted
up
on
the
cross
after
the
manner
of
men
and
he
heard
a
loud
voice
and
the
heavens
were
veiled
and
all
the
creations
of
god
mourned
and
the
earth
groaned
and
the
rocks
were
rent
and
the
saints
arose
and
were
crowned
at
the
right
hand
of
the
son
of
man
with
crowns
of
glory
and
as
many
of
the
spirits
as
were
in
prison
came
forth
and
stood
on
the
right
hand
of
god
and
the
remainder
were
reserved
in
chains
of
darkness
until
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
and
it
came
to
pass
that
enoch
saw
the
day
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
in
the
last
days
to
dwell
on
the
earth
in
righteousness
for
the
space
of
a
thousand
years
and
the
lord
showed
enoch
all
things
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
and
he
saw
the
day
of
the
righteous
the
hour
of
their
redemption
and
received
a
fulness
of
joy
and
all
the
days
of
zion
in
the
days
of
enoch
were
three
hundred
and
years
and
enoch
and
all
his
people
walked
with
god
and
he
dwelt
in
the
midst
of
zion
and
it
came
to
pass
that
zion
was
not
for
god
received
it
up
into
his
own
bosom
and
from
thence
went
forth
the
saying
zion
is
fled
from
the
foregoing
extracts
we
learn
amongst
other
truths
all
based
upon
enoch
faith
in
the
atoning
blood
of
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
the
following
that
enoch
was
clothed
with
glory
and
saw
the
lord
who
talked
with
him
as
one
man
talks
with
another
even
face
to
face
that
the
lord
commanded
enoch
to
preach
repentance
and
to
baptize
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
the
son
which
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
and
the
holy
spirit
which
bears
record
of
the
father
and
the
son
that
so
great
was
the
faith
of
enoch
that
he
led
the
people
of
god
overthrew
their
enemies
and
at
his
word
the
earth
trembled
whilst
the
mountains
rivers
and
seas
obeyed
his
command
that
through
this
faith
enoch
saw
the
days
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
man
in
the
flesh
and
by
it
he
obtained
a
covenant
from
the
lord
that
after
noah
day
he
would
never
again
cover
the
earth
by
a
flood
and
obtained
an
unalterable
decree
that
a
remnant
of
his
seed
should
always
be
found
among
all
nations
while
the
earth
should
stand
that
the
lord
showed
enoch
the
world
and
its
future
history
for
the
space
of
many
generations
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
that
so
great
was
the
faith
and
righteousness
of
enoch
and
his
people
that
the
lord
came
down
and
dwelt
with
them
and
in
process
of
time
enoch
city
zion
was
taken
up
into
heaven
and
many
through
the
testimony
of
the
father
and
the
son
were
afterwards
caught
up
by
the
powers
of
heaven
into
zion
and
further
that
while
enoch
through
the
favor
of
the
almighty
not
only
had
a
mission
to
preach
the
gospel
and
to
gather
the
people
but
that
he
was
also
empowered
to
have
the
people
that
he
had
thus
gathered
and
taught
and
instructed
in
the
laws
of
life
and
the
city
in
which
they
dwelt
translated
and
taken
into
the
bosom
of
the
father
there
to
be
preserved
until
the
latter
times
while
the
threatened
calamities
should
overtake
the
world
but
he
also
further
obtained
a
promise
that
the
future
peopling
of
the
earth
should
come
through
his
seed
thus
making
him
one
of
the
great
agencies
to
administer
salvation

we
are
told
noah
and
his

came
forth
out
of
the
ark
and
noah
builded
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
took
of

and
of

clean
fowl
and
offered

the
lord
smelled

lord
said
in

i
will
not

for

viii
the
details
of
this
act
are
given
us
somewhat
differently
in
the
inspired
translation
it
is
there
written
and
noah
builded
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
took
of
every
clean
beast
and
of
every
clean
fowl
and
offered
burnt
offerings
on
the
altar
and
gave
thanks
unto
the
lord
and
rejoiced
in
his
heart
and
the
lord
spake
unto
noah
and
he
blessed
him
and
noah
smelt
a
sweet
savour
and
he
said
in
his
heart
i
will
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
that
he
will
not
again
curse
the
ground
any
more
for
man
sake
for
the
imagination
of
man
heart
is
evil
from
his
youth
and
that
he
will
not
smite
any
more
every
thing
living
as
he
hath
done
while
the
earth
remaineth
and
that
seed
time
and
harvest
and
cold
and
heat
and
summer
and
winter
and
day
and
night
may
not
cease
with
man
thus
we
discover
that
the
first
act
after
the
destruction
of
the
world
by
a
flood
was
a
recognition
of
the
great
expiatory
principle
of
the
atonement
which
was
to
be
made
by
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
as
revealed
by
the
angel
to
adam
and
as
god
recognized
adam
and
abel
offerings
so
he
also
recognized
that
of
noah
and
as
a
result
the
patriarch
obtained
great
promises
in
which
the
people
of
all
ages
then
to
come
would
be
interested
for
god
spake
unto
noah
and
to
his
sons
with
him
saying
and
i
behold
i
will
establish
my
covenant
with
you
which
i
made
unto
your
father
enoch
concerning
your
seed
after
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
living
creature
that
is
with
you
of
the
fowl
and
of
the
cattle
and
of
the
beast
of
the
earth
that
is
with
you
which
shall
go
out
of
the
ark
shall
not
altogether
perish
neither
shall
all

off
any
more
by
the
waters
of
a

neither

there
any
more
be
a

destroy
the

and
i
will
establish
my
covenant
with
you
which
i
made
unto
enoch
concerning
the
remnants
of
your
posterity
and
god
made
a
covenant
with
noah
and
said
this
shall
be
the
token
of
the
covenant
i
make
between
me
and
you
and
for
every
living
creature
with
you
for
perpetual
generations
i

set
my
bow
in

cloud
and
it
shall
be

a
token
of
a

it
shall
come
to

when
i
bring
a
cloud
over
the

that
the

shall
be
seen
in
the

and
i
will
remember
my
covenant
which
i
have
made
between

and
you
for
every
living

of
all
flesh
and
the
waters
shall
no
more
become
a
flood
to
destroy
all
flesh
and
the
bow
shall
be
in
the
cloud
and
i
will
look
upon
it
that
i
may
remember
the
everlasting
covenant
which
i
made
unto
thy
father
enoch
that
when
men
should
keep
all
my
commandments
zion
should
again
come
on
the
earth
the
city
of
enoch
which
i
have
caught
up
unto
myself
and
this
is
mine
everlasting
covenant
that
when
thy
posterity
shall
embrace
the
truth
and
look
upward
then
shall
zion
look
downward

all
the

shall
shake
with
gladness

the

shall
tremble

come
down
out

possess
the

shall
have
place

this
is
mine
everlasting

i
made
with
thy

shall
be
in

we
will
now
turn
to
melchizedek
of
whom
it
is
written
in
king
translation
and
melchizedek
king
of
salem
brought
forth
bread
and
wine
and
he
was
the
priest
of
the
most

gave
him
tithes
of
all
xiv
this
passage
is
given
with
greater
completeness
in
the
inspired
translation
where
it
appears
as
follows
and
melchizedek
king
of
salem
brought
forth
bread
and
wine
and
he
brake
bread
and
blessed
it
and
he
blessed
the
wine
he
being
the
priest
of
the
most
high
god
and
he
gave
to
abram
and
he
blessed
him
and
said
blessed
abram
thou
art
a
man
of
the
most
high

possessor
of
heaven
and
of
earth
and
blessed
is
the
name
of
the
most
high
god
which
hath
delivered
thine
enemies
into
thine
hand
and
abram
gave
him
tithes
of
all
he
had
taken
in
this
action
of
melchizedek
in
administering
the
bread
and
wine
by
virtue
of
his
priestly
office
is
there
not
a
representation
of
the
body
and
blood
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
as
also
indicated
by
the
messiah
himself
when
he
partook
of
the
passover
with
his
disciples
for
melchizedek
was
a
great
high
priest
of
the
same
order
and
like
priesthood
as
was
held
by
the
son
of
god
so
great
indeed
that
before
his
day
it
was
called
the
holy
priesthood
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
but
out
of
respect
or
reverence
to
the
name
of
the
supreme
being
to
avoid
the
too
frequent
repetition
of
his
name
they
the
church
in
ancient
days
called
that
priesthood
after
melchizedek
or
the
melchizedek
doc
and
sec
par
paul
also
in
reasoning
on
this
subject
in
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
chapter
vii
writes
for
this
melchizedek
king
of
salem
priest
of
the
most
high
god
who
met
abraham
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
kings
and
blessed
him
to
whom
also
abraham
gave
a
tenth
part
of
all
first
being
by
interpretation
king
of
righteousness
and
after
that
also
king
of
salem
which
is
king
of
peace
without
father
without
mother
without
descent
having
neither
beginning
of
days
nor
end
of
life
but
made
like
unto
the
son
of
god
abideth
a
priest
continually
now
consider
how
great
this
man
was
unto
whom
even
the
patriarch
abraham
gave
the
tenth
of
the
spoils
and
verily
they
that
are
of
the
sons
of
levi
who
receive
the
office
of
the
priesthood
have
a
commandment
to
take
tithes
of
the
people
according
to
the
law
that
is
of
their
brethren
though
they
come
out
of
the
loins
of
abraham
but
he
whose
descent
is
not
counted
from
them
received
tithes
of
abraham
and
blessed
him
that
had
the
promises
and
without
all
contradiction
the
less
is
blessed
of
the
better
to
make
the
matter
still
plainer
we
transcribe
the
third
verse
from
the
inspired
translation
for
this
melchizedek
was
ordained
a
priest
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
which
order
was
without
father
without
mother
without
descent
having
neither
beginning
of
days
nor
end
of
life
and
all
those
who
are
ordained
unto
this
priesthood
are
made
like
unto
the
son
of
god
abiding
a
priest
continually
in
genesis
inspired
translation
chapter
xiv
it
is
also
stated
regarding
melchizedek
thus
having
been
approved
of
god
he
was
ordained
an
high
priest
after
the
order
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
enoch
it
being
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
which
order
came
not
by
man
nor
the
will
of
man
neither
by
father
nor
mother
neither
by
beginning
of
days
nor
end
of
years
but
of
god
and
it
was
delivered
unto
men
by
the
calling
of
his
own
voice
according
to
his
own
will
unto
as
many
as
believed
on
his
name
for
god
having
sworn
unto
enoch
and
unto
his
seed
with
an
oath
by
himself
that
every
one
being
ordained
after
this
order
and
calling
should
have
power
by
faith
to
break
mountains
to
divide
the
seas
to
dry
up
waters
to
turn
them
out
of
their
course
to
put
at
defiance
the
armies
of
nations
to
divide
the
earth
to
break
every
band
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
god
to
do
all
things
according
to
his
will
according
to
his
command
subdue
principalities
and
powers
and
this
by
the
will
of
the
son
of
god
which
was
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
men
having
this
faith
coming
up
unto
this
order
of
god
were
translated
and
taken
up
into
heaven
and
now
melchizedek
was
a
priest
of
this
order
therefore
he
obtained
peace
in
salem
and
was
called
the
prince
of
peace
and
his
people
wrought
righteousness
and
obtained
heaven
and
sought
for
the
city
of
enoch
which
god
had
before
taken
separating
it
from
the
earth
having
reserved
it
unto
the
or
the
end
of
the
world
and
hath
said
and
sworn
with
an
oath
that
the
heavens
and
the
earth
should
come
together
and
the
sons
of
god
should
be
tried
so
as
by
fire
and
this
melchizedek
having
thus
established
righteousness
was
called
the
king
of
heaven
by
his
people
or
in
other
words
the
king
of
peace
from
the
above
it
would
seem
that
this
people
possessed
the
power
of
translation
and
that
they
obtained
heaven
and
sought
for
the
city
of
enoch
which
god
had
before
taken
or
which
was
before
translated
the
principle
of
power
also
over
the
varied
creations
of
god
above
spoken
of
pertaining
to
the
holy
priesthood
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
has
by
faith
been
manifested
to
the
world
in
the
lives
and
actions
of
numbers
of
the
servants
of
the
most
high
the
power
of
enoch
wherein
he
caused
the
earth
to
tremble
whilst
mountains
fled
at
his
command
and
rivers
were
turned
out

their
course

mighty
miracles
among
them
nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
all
these
miracles
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
and
did
seek
to
kill
them
even
as
the
jews
at
jerusalem
sought
to
kill
jesus
according
to
his
word
and
they
did
cast
them
into
furnaces
of
fire
and
they
came
forth
receiving
no
harm
and
they
also
cast
them
into
dens
of
wild
beasts
and
they
did
play
with
the
wild
beasts
even
as
a
child
with
a
lamb
and
they
did
come
forth
from
among
them
receiving
no
harm
nephi
i
this
same
power
has
also
been
abundantly
manifested
in
these
latter
days
in
the
midst
of
the
saints
of
god
in
deliverances
from
evil
in
escapes
from
enemies
in
the
quelling
of
mobs
in
the
stilling
of
the
angry
waves
of
the
sea
in
the
healing
of
the
sick
in
the
casting
out
of
unclean
spirits
and
in
many
other
miraculous
manifestations
of
the
power
and
goodness
of
god
and
of
the
authority
with
which
he
has
invested
his
servants
who
are
endowed
and
clothed
upon
with
the
priesthood
which
is
endless
and
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
thus
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
and
the
salvation
and
redemption
brought
about
by
that
atonement
these
wonderful
manifestations
and
deliverances
have
been
accomplished
by
faith
in
god
and
the
priesthood
being
after
the
order
of
the
son
of
god
and
proceeding
from
him
through
the
atonement
those
who
held
this
priesthood
possessed
according
to
their
faith
the
above
mentioned
powers
and
without
that
atonement
this
power
never
could
have
existed
for
men
without
that
sacrifice
could
not
have
been
brought
into
that
relationship
to
god
by
which
they
would
have
the
right
the
power
and
authority
to
act
in
his
name
or
to
be
his
representatives
to
fallen
humanity
in
fact
the
power
manifested
by
the
priesthood
is
simply
the
power
of
god
for
he
is
the
head
of
the
priesthood
with
jesus
as
our
president
and
great
high
priest
and
it
is
upon
this
principle
that
all
the
works
of
god
have
been
accomplished
whether
on
the
earth
or
in
the
heavens
and
any
manifestation
of
power
through
the
priesthood
on
the
earth
is
simply
a
delegated
power
from
the
priesthood
in
the
heavens
and
the
more
the
priesthood
on
the
earth
becomes
assimilated
with
and
subject
to
the
priesthood
in
the
heavens
the
more
of
this
power
shall
we
possess
hence
paul
in
speaking
on
this
subject
says
through
faith
we
understand
that
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
god
so
that
things
which
are
seen
were
not
made
of
things
which
do
appear
xi
the
work
of
god
and
the
glory
of
god
is
to
bring
to
pass
the
immortality
and
eternal
life
of
man
as
it
is
written
for
this
is
my
work
and
my
glory
to
bring
to
pass
the
immortality
and
eternal
life
of
man
pearl
of
great
price
the
creation
of
man
and
the
multiplication
of
man
was
one
thing
the
immortality
and
eternal
life
of
man
and
his
exaltation
is
another
thing
and
in
the
organization
of
the
world
and
in
the
calculations
of
the
almighty
pertaining
to
this
immortality
and
eternal
life
it
would
seem
that
it
was
decreed
that
the
only
begotten
son
was
provided
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
this
object
and
hence
christ
was
the
lamb
slain
according
to
the
eternal
purposes
of
god
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
in
relation
to
the
creation
of
the
worlds
as
above
referred
to
by
paul
john
in
the
commencement
of
his
gospel
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
a
preface
or
introduction
writes
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
in
him
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
and
the
light
shineth
in
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
john
i
or
to
give
the
passage
in
the
wording
of
the
inspired
translation
in
the
beginning
was
the
gospel
preached
through
the
son
and
the
gospel
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
the
son
and
the
son
was
with
god
and
the
son
was
of
god
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
which
was
made
in
him
was
the
gospel
and
the
gospel
was
the
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
and
the
light
shineth
in
the
world
and
the
world
perceiveth
it
not
from
the
testimony
of
john
as
given
in
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
we
also
extract
the
following
and
he
bore
record
saying
i
saw
his
glory
that
he
was
in
the
beginning
before
the
world
was
therefore
in
the
beginning
the
word
was
for
he
was
the
word
even
the
messenger
of
salvation
the
light
and
the
redeemer
of
the
world
the
spirit
of
truth
who
came
into
the
world
because
the
world
was
made
by
him
and
in
him
was
the
life
of
men
and
the
light
of
men
the
worlds
were
made
by
him
men
were
made
by
him
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
through
him
and
of
him
and
i
john
bear
record
that
i
beheld
his
glory
as
the
glory
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
full
of
grace
and
truth
even
the
spirit
of
truth
which
came
and
dwelt
in
the
flesh
and
dwelt
among
sec
xciii
paul
likewise
in
his
epistles
more
than
once
directs
attention
to
this
great
truth
in
writing
to
the
colossians
he
says
for
by
him
were
all
things
created
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
visible
and
invisible
whether
they
be
thrones
or
dominions
or
principalities
or
powers
all
things
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
and
he
is
before
all
things
and
by
him
all
things
consist
i
and
to
the
hebrews
he
writes
that
god
hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
son
whom
he
hath
appointed
heir
of
all
things
by
whom
also
he
made
the
worlds
who
being
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
the
express
image
of
his
person
and
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
power
when
he
had
by
himself
purged
our
sins
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
majesty
on
high
i
god
revealed
these
things
unto
moses
but
his
words
in
relation
thereto
are
among
the
precious
things
that
have
been
taken
from
the
scriptures
by
the
iniquity
of
man
amongst
those
restored
to
us
by
modern
revelation
are
the
following
words
of
god
to
that
patriarch
with
regard
to
the
creation
and
by
the
word
of
my
power
have
i
created
them
which
is
mine
only
begotten
son
who
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
and
worlds
without
number
have
i
created
and
i
also
created
them
for
mine
own
purpose
and
by
the
son
i
created
them
which
is
mine
only
begotten

only
an

behold
there
are

which
have
passed

by

word
of
my
power
and
there
are
many
also
which
now
stand

regarding

the
lord
also
revealed
to
abraham
many
great
and
glorious
principles
and
truths
relating
to
the
creation
we
extract
the
following
from
the
fragment
of
the
writings
of
that
patriarch
which
has
been
graciously
restored
to
us
by
the
lord
in
these
days
and
the
gods
prepared
the
earth
to
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind
cattle
and
creeping
things
and
beasts
of
the
earth
after
their
kind
and
it
was
so
as
they
had
said
and
the
gods
organized
the
earth
to
bring
forth
the
beasts
after
their
kind
the
cattle
after
their
kind
and
everything
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
after
their
kind
and
the
gods
saw
they
would
obey
and
the
gods
took
counsel
among
themselves
and
said
let
us
go
down
and
form
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
we
will
give
them
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
earth
and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
so
the
gods
went
down
to
organize
man
in
their
own
image
in
the
image
of
the
gods
to
form
they
him
male
and
female
to
form
they
them
and
the
gods
said
we
will
bless
them
and
the
gods
said
we
will
cause
them
to
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
to
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
and
the
gods
said
behold
we
will
give
them
every
herb
bearing
seed
that
shall
come
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree
which
shall
have
fruit
upon
it
yea
the
fruit
of
the
tree
yielding
seed
to
them
we
will
give
it
it
shall
be
for
their
meat
and
to
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
to
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
to
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
behold
we
will
give
them
life
and
also
we
will
give
to
them
every
green
herb
for
meat
and
all
these
things
shall
be
thus
organized
and
the
gods
said
we
will
do
every
thing
that
we
have
said
and
organize
them
and
behold
they
shall
be
very
obedient
and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
from
evening
until
morning
they
called
night
and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
from
morning
until
evening
that
they
called
day
and
they
numbered
the
sixth
time
and
thus
we
will
finish
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
the
hosts
of
them
and
the
gods
said
among
themselves
on
the
seventh
time
we
will
end
our
work
which
we
have
counseled
and
we
will
rest
on
the
seventh
time
from
all
our
work
which
we
have
counseled
and
the
gods
concluded
upon
the
seventh
time
because
that
on
the
seventh
time
they
would
rest
from
all
their
works
which
they
the
gods
counseled
among
themselves
to
form
and
sanctified
it
and
thus
were
their
decisions
at
the
time
that
they
counseled
among
themselves
to
form
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
the
gods
came
down
and
formed
these
the
generations
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
when
they
were
formed
in
the
day
that
the
gods
formed
the
earth
and
the
heavens
according
to
all
that
which
they
had
said
concerning
every
plant
of
the
field
before
it
was
in
the
earth
and
every
herb
of
the
field
before
it
grew
for
the
gods
had
not
caused
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth
when
they
counseled
to
do
them
and
had
not
formed
a
man
to
till
the
ground
but
there
went
up
a
mist
from
the
earth
and
watered
the
whole
face
of
the
ground
and
the
gods
formed
man
from
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
took
his
spirit
that
is
the
man
spirit
and
put
it
into
him
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a
living
soul
although
this
matter
of
the
council
or
conference
is
not
so
fully
exhibited
in
the
old
testament
scriptures
as
in
this
revelation
to
abraham
yet
it
is
definitely
stated
in
the
book
of
genesis
that
god
said
let
make
man
in
image
after
likeness
and
again
after
adam
had
taken
of
the
forbidden
fruit
the
lord
said
behold
the
man
has
become
as
one
of
us
and
the
inference
is
direct
that
in
all
that
related
to
the
work
of
the
creation
of
the
world
there
was
a
consultation
and
though
god
spake
as
it
is
recorded
in
the
bible
yet
it
is
evident
he
counseled
with
others
the
scriptures
tell
us
there
are
gods
many
and
lords
many
but
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
the
father
viii
and
for
this
reason
though
there
were
others
engaged
in
the
creation
of
the
worlds
it
is
given
to
us
in
the
bible
in
the
shape
that
it
is
for
the
fulness
of
these
truths
is
only
revealed
to
highly
favored
persons
for
certain
reasons
known
to
god
as
we
are
told
in
the
scriptures
the
secret
of
the
lord
is
with
them
that
fear
him
and
he
will
show
them
his
covenant
psalms
xxv
it
is
consistent
to
believe
that
at
this
council
in
the
heavens
the
plan
that
should
be
adopted
in
relation
to
the
sons
of
god
who
were
then
spirits
and
had
not
yet
obtained
tabernacles
was
duly
considered
for
in
view
of
the
creation
of
the
world
and
the
placing
of
men
upon
it
whereby
it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
obtain
tabernacles
and
in
those
tabernacles
obey
laws
of
life
and
with
them
again
be
exalted
among
the
gods
we
are
told
that
at
that
time
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
the
question
then
arose
how
and
upon
what
principle
should
the
salvation
exaltation
and
eternal
glory
of
god
sons
be
brought
about
it
is
evident
that
at
that
council
certain
plans
had
been
proposed
and
discussed
and
that
after
a
full
discussion
of
those
principles
and
the
declaration
of
the
father
will
pertaining
to
his
design
lucifer
came
before
the
father
with
a
plan
of
his
own
saying
behold
i
send
me
i
will
be
thy
son
and
i
will
redeem
all
mankind
that
one
soul
shall
not
be
lost
and
surely
i
will
do
it
wherefore
give
me
thine
honor
but
jesus
on
hearing
this
statement
made
by
lucifer
said
father
thy
will
be
done
and
the
glory
be
thine
forever
from
these
remarks
made
by
the
well
beloved
son
we
should
naturally
infer
that
in
the
discussion
of
this
subject
the
father
had
made
known
his
will
and
developed
his
plan
and
design
pertaining
to
these
matters
and
all
that
his
well
beloved
son
wanted
to
do
was
to
carry
out
the
will
of
his
father
as
it
would
appear
had
been
before
expressed
he
also
wished
the
glory
to
be
given
to
his
father
who
as
god
the
father
and
the
originator
and
designer
of
the
plan
had
a
right
to
all
the
honor
and
glory
but
lucifer
wanted
to
introduce
a
plan
contrary
to
the
will
of
his
father
and
then
wanted
his
honor
and
said
i
will
save
every
soul
of
man
wherefore
give
me
thine
honor
he
wanted
to
go
contrary
to
the
will
of
his
father
and
presumptuously
sought
to
deprive
man
of
his
free
agency
thus
making
him
a
serf
and
placing
him
in
a
position
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
obtain
that
exaltation
which
god
designed
should
be
man
through
obedience
to
the
law
which
he
had
suggested
and
again
lucifer
wanted
the
honor
and
power
of
his
father
to
enable
him
to
carry
out
principles
which
were
contrary
to
the
father
wish
and
further
in
regard
to
agency
if
man
had
not
had
his
agency
or
if
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
agency
he
could
not
have
been
tempted
of
the
devil
or
of
any
other
power
for
if
the
will
of
god
prevailed
and
was
carried
out
without
man
action
or
agency
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
done
anything
wrong
for
he
would
have
been
deprived
of
the
power
of
doing
that
wrong
this
was
the
position
that
satan
desired
to
place
not
only
the
spirits
in
the
heavens
but
also
mankind
upon
the
earth
and
satan
said
surely
i
will
save
every
one
of
them
wherefore
give
me
thine
honor
but
god
plan
was
different
from
this
and
as
stated
above
had
been
decided
upon
in
the
councils
of
heaven
and
the
father
had
made
a
decree
as
to
how
these
things
should
be
done
and
that
both
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
and
the
inhabitants
of
earth
should
have
their
free
agency
it
was
against
this
that
lucifer
rebelled
and
he
could
not
have
rebelled
against
a
plan
or
commandment
that
had
not
been
given
for
rebellion
signifies
a
violation
of
law
command
or
authority
and
he
was
cast
out
of
heaven
because
of
this
rebellion
this
rebellion
could
not
have
existed
without
a
free
agency
for
without
a
free
agency
they
would
all
have
been
compelled
to
do
the
will
of
the
father
but
having
the
free
agency
they
used
it
and
lucifer
and
a
third
part
of
the
angels
were
cast
out
because
they
rebelled
and
used
this
agency
in
opposition
to
their
heavenly
father
and
not
only
because
they
rebelled
but
because
as
stated
they
sought
to
destroy
the
agency
of
man
and
their
agency
would
have
been
used
in
opposition
to
the
interests
happiness
and
eternal
exaltation
of
mankind
which
were
proposed
to
be
accomplished
through
the
atonement
and
redemption
provided
by
jesus
christ
in
accordance
with
this
we
find
the
following
statements
in
the
revelations
given
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
behold
the
devil
was
before
adam
for
he
rebelled
against
me
saying
give
me
thine
honor
which
is
my
power
and
also
a
third
part
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
turned
he
away
from
me
because
of
their
agency
and
they
were
thrust
down
and
thus
came
the
devil
and
his
angels
and
behold
there
is
a
place
prepared
for
them
from
the
beginning
which
place
is
hell
and
it
must
needs
be
that
the
devil
should
tempt
the
children
of
men
or
they
could
not
be
agents
unto
themselves
for
if
they
never
should
have
bitter
they
could
not
know
the
doc
and
xxix
and
again
and
this
we
saw
also
and
bear
record
that
an
angel
of
god
who
was
in
authority
in
the
presence
of
god
who
rebelled
against
the
only
begotten
son
whom
the
father
loved
and
who
was
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
was
thrust
down
from
the
presence
of
god
and
the
son
and
was
called
perdition
for
the
heavens
wept
over
him
he
was
lucifer
a
son
of
the
morning
and
we
beheld
and
lo
he
is
fallen
is
fallen
even
a
son
of
the
morning
and
while
we
were
yet
in
the
spirit
the
lord
commanded
us
that
we
should
write
the
vision
for
we
beheld
satan
that
old
serpent
even
the
devil
who
rebelled
against
god
and
sought
to
take
the
kingdom
of
our
god
and
his
christ
doc
and
lxxvi
the
father
accepted
the
offer
of
his
well
beloved
son
and
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
decision
of
the
council
and
as
we
are
informed
in
the
bible
inspired
translation
god
said
to
his
only
begotten
let
us
make
man
in
our
image
after
our
likeness
and
it
was
so
there
are
other
questions
mixed
up
with
this
rebellion
besides
those
above
referred
to
and
those
questions
are
directly
connected
with
the
atonement
in
the
event
of
man
having
his
free
will
and
being
subject
to
the
power
of
temptation
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
the
allurements
of
the
world
and
the
powers
of
darkness
it
was
known
that
he
must
necessarily
fall
and
being
fallen
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
redeem
himself
and
that
according
to
an
eternal
law
of
justice
it
would
require
an
infinite
expiatory
atonement
to
redeem
man
to
save
him
from
the
effects
and
ruin
of
the
fall
and
to
place
him
in
a
condition
where
he
could
again
be
reinstated
in
the
favor
of
god
according
to
the
eternal
laws
of
justice
and
mercy
and
find
his
way
back
to
the
presence
of
the
father
satan
it
is
possible
being
opposed
to
the
will
of
his
father
wished
to
avoid
the
responsibilities
of
this
position
and
rather
than
assume
the
consequences
of
the
acceptance
of
the
plan
of
the
father
he
would
deprive
man
of
his
free
agency
and
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
obtain
that
exaltation
which
god
designed
it
would
further
seem
probable
that
he
refused
to
take
the
position
of
redeemer
and
assume
all
the
consequences
associated
therewith
but
he
did
propose
as
stated
before
to
take
another
plan
and
deprive
man
of
his
agency
and
he
probably
intended
to
make
men
atone
for
their
own
acts
by
an
act
of
coercion
and
the
shedding
of
their
own
blood
as
an
atonement
for
their
sins
therefore
he
says
i
will
redeem
all
mankind
that
one
soul
shall
not
be
lost
and
surely
i
will
do
it
wherefore
give
me
thine
honor
his
plan
however
was
rejected
as
contrary
to
the
counsel
of
god
his
father
the
well
beloved
son
then
addressed
the
father
and
instead
of
proposing
to
carry
out
any
plan
of
his
own
knowing
what
his
father
will
was
said
thy
will
be
done
will
carry
out
thy
plans
and
thy
designs
and
as
man
will
fall
i
will
offer
myself
as
an
atonement
according
to
thy
will
o
god
neither
do
i
wish
the
honor
but
thine
be
the
glory
and
a
covenant
was
entered
into
between
him
and
his
father
in
which
he
agreed
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
he
thus
as
stated
became
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
in
this
connection
it
is
related
by
abraham
and
there
stood
one
among
them
that
was
like
unto
god
and
he
said
unto
those
who
were
with
him
we
will
go
down
for
there
is
space
there
and
we
will
take
of
these
materials
and
we
will
make
an
earth
whereon
these
may
dwell
and
we
will
prove
them
herewith
to
see
if
they
will
do
all
things
whatsoever
the
lord
their
god
shall
command
them
and
they
who
keep
their
first
estate
shall
be
added
upon
and
they
who
keep
not
their
first
estate
shall
not
have
glory
in
the
same
kingdom
with
those
who
keep
their
first
estate
and
they
who
keep
their
second
estate
shall
have
glory
added
upon
their
heads
for
ever
and
ever
and
hence
as
jesus
himself
said
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behooved
christ
to
suffer
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
day
and
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
nations
beginning
at
jerusalem
we
will
now
give
in
full
the
quotation
from
the
pearl
of
great
price
with
regard
to
the
above
matter
and
also
add
a
short
recapitulation
and
i
the
lord
god
spake
unto
moses
saying
that
satan
whom
thou
hast
commanded
in
the
name
of
mine
only
begotten
is
the
same
which
was
from
the
beginning
and
he
came
before
me
saying
behold
i
send
me
i
will
be
thy
son
and
i
will
redeem
all
mankind
that
one
soul
shall
not
be
lost
and
surely
i
will
do
it
wherefore
give
me
thine
honor
but
behold
my
beloved
son
which
was
my
beloved
and
chosen
from
the
beginning
said
unto
me
father
thy
will
be
done
and
the
glory
be
thine
for
ever
wherefore
because
that
satan
rebelled
against
me
and
sought
to
destroy
the
agency
of
man
which
i
the
lord
god
had
given
him
and
also
that
i
should
give
unto
him
mine
own
power
by
the
power
of
mine
only
begotten
i
caused
that
he
should
be
cast
down
and
he
became
satan
yea
even
the
devil
the
father
of
all
lies
to
deceive
and
to
blind
men
and
to
lead
them
captive
at
his
will
even
as
many
as
would
not
hearken
unto
my
voice
from
the
above
we
gather
first
that
the
proposition
of
lucifer
was
an
act
of
rebellion
against
me
god
second
that
god
had
already
decreed
that
man
should
have
his
free
agency
and
this
agency
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
lord
as
it
is
said
which
i
the
lord
god
had
given
him
third
that
lucifer
coveted
and
asked
for
a
power
which
was
the
prerogative
of
the
almighty
and
alone
belonged
to
god
and
which
he
called
mine
own
power
fourth
that
for
this
rebellion
lucifer
was
cast
out
and
became
satan
fifth
that
the
power
by
which
he
was
cast
out
was
by
a
certain
power
or
priesthood
which
had
been
conferred
by
god
on
his
only
begotten
for
he
said
by
the
power
of
mine
only
begotten
i
caused
that
he
should
be
cast
down
sixth
that
being
cast
down
and
becoming
satan
even
the
devil
the
father
of
lies
his
office
was
to
deceive
and
to
blind
men
as
it
is
stated
to
deceive
and
to
blind
men
and
to
lead
them
captive
at
his
will
even
as
many
as
would
not
hearken
unto
my
voice
chapter

abraham
isaac
and
jacob
sacrifices
offered
by
them
abraham
and
the
gospel
covenant
extracts
from
the
book
of
abraham
and
the
writings
of
paul
we
will
now
return
to
abraham
who
is
denominated
the
father
of
the
faithful
and
who
as
we
have
before
seen
was
a
contemporary
of
melchizedek
the
testimony
in
the
bible
is
direct
and
explicit
that
abraham
fulfilled
the
law
requiring
the
offering
of
sacrifices
and
furthermore
was
in
possession
of
the
principles
of
the
gospel
and
understood
the
saving
value
of
the
atonement
in
the
historical
narrative
of
the
book
of
genesis
we
have
numerous
testimonies
that
abraham
offered
up
sacrifices
in
connection
with
his
worship
of
the
almighty
for
instance
it
is
written
and
abram
passed
through
the
land
unto
the
place
of
sichem
unto
the
plain
of
moreh
and
the
canaanite
was
then
in
the
land
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
abram
and
said
unto
thy
seed
will
i
give
this
land
and
there
builded
he
an
altar
unto
the
lord
who
appeared
unto
him
and
he
removed
from
thence
unto
a
mountain
on
the
east
of
and
pitched
his
tent
having
on
the
west
and
hai
on
the
east
and
there
he
builded
an
altar
unto
the
lord
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
xii
in
the
next
chapter
we
are
told
that
abraham
went
on
his
journeys
from
the
south
even
to
unto
the
place
where
his
tent
had
been
at
the
beginning
between
and
hai
unto
the
place
of
the
altar
which
he
had
made
there
at
the
first
and
there
abram
called
on
the
name
of
the
lord
xiii
and
afterwards
he
removed
his
tent
and
came
and
dwelt
in
the
plain
of
mamre
which
is
in
hebron
and
built
there
an
altar
unto
the
lord
xiii
the
book
of
abraham
gives
some
further
details
on
these
matters
the
patriarch
therein
states
now
i
abraham
built
an
altar
in
the
land
of
jershon
and
made
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
prayed
that
the
famine
might
be
turned
away
from
my
father
house
that
they
might
not
perish
and
then
we
passed
from
jershon
through
the
land
unto
the
place
of
sechem
it
was
situated
in
the
plains
of
moreh
and
we
had
already
come
into
the
borders
of
the
land
of
the
canaanites
and
i
offered
sacrifice
there
in
the
plains
of
moreh
and
called
on
the
lord
devoutly
because
we
had
already
come
into
the
land
of
this
idolatrous
nation
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
me
in
answer
to
my
prayers
and
said
unto
me
unto
thy
seed
will
i
give
this
land
and
i
abraham
arose
from
the
place
of
the
altar
which
i
had
built
unto
the
lord
and
removed
from
thence
unto
a
mountain
on
the
east
of
bethel
and
pitched
my
tent
there
bethel
on
the
west
and
hai
on
the
east
and
there
i
built
another
altar
unto
the
lord
and
called
again
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
pearl
of
great
price
although
full
details
are
not
given
of
the
mode
of
sacrifice
in
those
ancient
times
nor
of
all
the
creatures
that
were
acceptable
unto
the
lord
in
the
performance
of
this
rite
yet
the
narrative
of
the
contemplated
sacrifice
of
isaac
by
his
father
is
indicative
of
the
principle
being
well
understood
we
are
told
that
the
young
man
said
my
father
and
he
said
here
am
i
my
son
and
he
said
behold
the
fire
and
the
wood
but
where
is
the
lamb
for
a
and
abraham
said
my
son
god
will
provide
himself
a
lamb
for
a
xxii
it
is
evident
from
other
scriptures
that
abraham
offered
up
these
sacrifices
in
token
of
the
great
expiatory
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
indeed
the
redeemer
himself
told
the
jews
your
father
abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
day
and
he
saw
it
and
was
glad
john
viii
in
confirmation
of
this
statement
we
read
in
the
inspired
translation
of
the
book
of
genesis
that
the
lord
said
to
abraham
in
relation
to
his
possession
of
the
land
of
canaan
though
thou
wast
dead
yet
am
i
not
able
to
give
it
thee
and
if
thou
shalt
die
yet
thou
shalt
possess
it
for
the
day
cometh
that
the
son
of
man
shall
live
but
how
can
he
live
if
he
be
not
dead
he
must
first
be
quickened
and
it
came
to
pass
that
abram
looked
forth
and
saw
the
days
of
the
son
of
man
and
was
glad
and
his
soul
found
rest
and
he
believed
in
the
lord
and
the
lord
counted
it
unto
him
for
righteousness
again
paul
in
writing
to
the
galatians
states
and
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
so
then
they
which
be
of
faith
are
blessed
with
faithful
abraham
iii
this
promise
is
corroborated
by
the
statements
of
peter
to
the
jews
ye
are
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
our
fathers
saying
unto
abraham
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
unto
you
first
god
having
raised
up
his
son
jesus
sent
him
to
bless
you
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
iniquities
acts
iii
the
record
of
this
covenant
is
to
be
found
in
the
book
of
genesis
as
follows
now
the
lord
had
said
unto
abram
get
thee
out
of
thy
country
and
from
thy
kindred
and
from
thy
father
house
unto
a
land
that
i
will
show
thee
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation
and
i
will
bless
thee
and
make
thy
name
great
and
i
will
bless
them
that
bless
thee
and
curse
him
that
curseth
thee
and
in
thee
shall
all
families
of
the
earth
be
blessed

a
footnote
a

genesis
xviii
xxii
it
will
be
noticed
in
the
above
quotation
from
the
book
of
genesis
that
no
reference
is
made
to
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
to
abraham
in
connection
with
these
great
promises
as
spoken
of
by
paul
this
deficiency
is
supplied
by
the
book
of
abraham
wherein
the
covenant
between
god
and
his
faithful
servant
is
given
at
greater
length
in
that
covenant
we
find
the
following
my
name
is
jehovah
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
great
nation
and
i
will
bless
thee
above
measure
and
make
thy
name
great
among
all
nations
and
thou
shalt
be
a
blessing
unto
thy
seed
after
thee
that
in
their
hands
they
shall
bear
this
ministry
and
priesthood
unto
all
nations
and
i
will
bless
them
through
thy
name
for
as
many
as
receive
this
gospel
shall
he
called
after
thy
name
and
shall
be
accounted
thy
seed
and
shall
rise
up
and
bless
thee
as
their
father
and
i
will
bless

that
bless

and

that

thee
and
in
thee
that

for
i
give
unto
thee
a
promise
that
this
right
shall
continue
in
thee
and
in
thy
seed
after
thee
that
is
to
say
the
literal
seed
or
the
seed
of
the

shall
all
the

of
the

be
blessed
even
with
the
blessings
of
the

which
are
the
blessings
of
salvation
even
of
life
eternal
of
the
personal
history
of
isaac
we
have
but
a
very
meagre
account
in
the
bible
however
sufficient
is
said
to
inform
us
that
he
like
his
father
offered
up
sacrifices
that
his
offering
was
acceptable
to
god
and
that
he
renewed
with
him
the
covenant
previously
made
with
abraham
of
isaac
it
is
written
and
he
went
up
from
thence
to
and
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
the
same
night
and
said
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
thy
father
fear
not
for
i
am
with
thee
and
will
bless
thee
and
multiply
thy
seed
for
my
servant
abraham
sake
and
he
builded
an
altar
there
and
called
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
xxvi
jacob
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
his
father
he
worshipped
the
true
and
living
god
and
had
the
blessings
of
his
fathers
confirmed
on
him
regarding
sacrifices
we
are
informed
that
after
his
sudden
departure
from
laban
and
their
later
somewhat
stormy
interview
jacob
offered
sacrifice
upon
the
mount
xxxi
and
again
shortly
after
by
command
of
the
lord
he
journeyed
to
bethel
and
he
built
there
an
altar
and
called
the
place
or
the
house

the

the

in
regard
to
the
offering
of
sacrifices
it
is
very
evident
that
in
the
days
of
moses
the
children
of
israel
were
quite
familiar
with
this
rite
as
also
were
the
egyptians
for
one
great
request
which
moses
and
aaron
made
of
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
was
let
us
go
we
pray
thee
three
days
journey
into
the
desert
and
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
our
god
and
as
a
reason
why
they
should
thus
go
into
the
wilderness
it
was
urged
by
them
when
the
egyptian
monarch
said
go
ye
sacrifice
to
your
god
in
the
land
that
it
is
not
meet
so
to
do
for
we
shall
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
egyptians
to
the
lord
our
god
lo
shall
we
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
egyptians
before
their
eyes
and
will
they
not
stone
us
we
will
go
three
days
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
sacrifice
to
the
lord
our
god
as
he
shall
command
us
viii
it
is
further
stated
that
after
a
time
when
all
other
judgments
had
failed
to
bring
about
the
desired
effect
with
pharaoh
that
moses
said
thus
saith
the
lord
about
midnight
will
i
go
out
into
the
midst
of
egypt
and
all
the
in
the
land
of
egypt
shall
die
from
the
of
pharaoh
that
sitteth
upon
his
throne
even
unto
the
of
the
that
is
behind
the
mill
and
all
the
of
beasts
and
there
shall
be
a
great
cry
throughout
all
the
land
of
egypt
such
as
there
was
none
like
it
nor
shall
be
like
it
any
more
but
against
any
of
the
children
of
israel
shall
not
a
dog
move
his
tongue
against
man
or
beast
that
ye
may
know
how
that
the
lord
doth
put
a
difference
between
the
egyptians
and
israel
xi
the
next
chapter
gives
the
history
of
the
fulfilment
of
this
threatened
judgment
and
the
results
that
flowed
therefrom
it
is
recorded
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
and
aaron
in
the
land
of
egypt
saying
this
month
shall
be
unto
you
the
beginning
of
months
it
shall
be
the
first
month
of
the
year
to
you
speak
ye
unto
all
the
congregation
of
israel
saying
in
the
tenth
day
of
this
month
they
shall
take
to
them
every
man
a
lamb
according
to
the
house
of
their
fathers
a
lamb
for
an
house
and
if
the
household
be
too
little
for
the
lamb
let
him
and
his
neighbor
next
unto
his
house
take
it
according
to
the
number
of
the
souls
every
man
according
to
his
eating

make
your
count

your
lamb
shall
be
without

a
male
of
the
first
year
ye
shall
take
it
out
from
the
sheep
or
from
the
goats
and
ye
shall
keep
it
up
until
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
same
month
and
the
whole
assembly
of
the
congregation
of
israel
shall
kill
it
in
the
evening
and
they
shall
take
of
the
blood
and
strike
it
on
the
two
and
on
the
upper
of
the
houses
wherein
they
shall
eat
it
and
they
shall
eat
the
flesh
in
that
night
roast
with
fire
and
unleavened
bread
and
with
bitter
herbs
they
shall
eat
it
xii
and
thus
shall
ye
eat
it
with
your
loins
girded
your
shoes
on
your
feet
and
your
staff
in
your
hand
and
ye
shall
eat
it
in
haste
it
is
the
lord
passover
for
i
will
pass
through
the
land
of
egypt
this
night
and
will
smite
all
the
in
the
land
of
egypt
both
man
and
beast
and
against
all
the
gods
of
egypt
i
will
execute
judgment
i
am
the
lord
and
the
blood
shall
be
to
you
for
a
token
upon
the
houses
where
ye
are
and
when
i
see
the
blood
i
will
pass
over
you
and
the
plague
shall
not
be
upon
you
to
destroy
you
when
i
smite
the
land
of

and
this
day
shall
be
unto
you
for
a
memorial
and
ye
shall
keep
it
a
feast
to
the
lord
throughout
your
generations
ye
shall
keep
it
a
feast
by
an
ordinance
for
ever
xii
then
moses
called
for
all
the
elders
of
israel
and
said
unto
them
draw
out
and
take
you
a
lamb
according
to
your
families
and
kill
the
passover
and
ye
take
a
bunch
of
hyssop
and
dip
it
in
the
blood
that
is
in
the
basin
and
strike
the
lintel
and
the
two
with
the
blood
that
is
in
the
basin
and
none
of
you
shall
go
out
at
the
door
of
his
house
until
the
morning
for
the
lord
will
pass
through
to
smite
the
egyptians
and
when
he
seeth
the
blood
upon
the
lintel
and
on
the
two
the
lord
will
pass
over
the
door
and
will
not
suffer
the
destroyer
to
come
in
unto
your
houses
to
smite
you
and
ye
shall
observe
this
thing
for
an
ordinance
to
thee
and
to
thy
sons
for
ever
xii
and
the
children
of
israel
went
away
and
did
as
the
lord
had
commanded
moses
and
aaron
so
did
they
and
it
came
to
pass
that
at
midnight
the
lord
smote
all
the
in
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
of
pharaoh
that
sat
on
his
throne
unto
the
of
the
captive
that
was
in
the
dungeon
and
all
the
of
cattle
and
pharaoh
rose
up
in
the
night
he
and
all
his
servants
and
all
the
egyptians
and
there
was
a
great
cry
in
egypt
for
there
was
not
a
house
where
there
was
not
one
dead
and
he
called
for
moses
and
aaron
by
night
and
said
rise
up
and
get
you
forth
from
among
my
people
both
ye
and
the
children
of
israel
and
go
serve
the
lord
as
ye
have
said
also
take
your
flocks
and
your
herds
as
ye
have
said
and
be
gone
and
bless
me
also
and
the
egyptians
were
urgent
upon
the
people
that
they
might
send
them
out
of
the
land
in
haste
for
they
said
we
be
all
dead
men
xii
it
is
further
said
and
it
shall
be
when
thy
son
asketh
thee
in
time
to
come
saying
what
is
this
that
thou
shalt
say
unto
him
by
strength
of
hand
the
lord
brought
us
out
from
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
and
it
came
to
pass
when
pharaoh
would
hardly
let
us
go
that
the
lord
slew
all
the
in
the
land
of
egypt
both
the
of
man
and
the
of
beasts
therefore
i
sacrifice
to
the
lord
all
that
openeth
the
matrix
being
males
but
all
the
of
my
children
i
redeem
xiii
from
the
above
quotations
amongst
other
important
matters
it
appears
that
when
the
destroying
angel
passed
by
the
houses
of
the
children
of
israel
he
found
the
blood
of
a
lamb
sprinkled
on
the
door
post
which
was
a
type
of
the
blood
of
christ
the
lamb
of
god
the
angel
who
was
the
executor
of
justice
could
not
touch
those
who
were
protected
by
that
sacred
symbol
because
that
prefigured
the
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
which
was
provided
at
the
beginning
of
creation
for
the
redemption
of
the
human
family
and
which
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
provisions
then
made
by
the
almighty
for
that
purpose
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
accepted
in
full
as
an
atonement
for
the
transgressions
of
mankind
according
to
the
requirements
of
eternal
justice
and
agreed
to
by
the
savior
and
his
father
a
proposition
is
made
to
meet
the
requirements
of
justice
which
proposal
is
accepted
by
the
contracting
parties
all
these
contracting
parties
being
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
thus
made
hence
it
is
said
by
one
of
the
prophets
then
he
is
gracious
unto
him
and
saith
deliver
him
from
going
down
to
the
pit
i
have
found

and
further
therefore
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
shall
return
and
come
with
singing
unto
zion
and
everlasting
joy
shall
be
upon
their
head
they
shall
obtain
gladness
and
joy

sorrow
and
mourning
shall

away
isaiah
li
who
are
the
redeemed
except
those
who
have
accepted
the
terms
of
the
ransom
thus
provided
the
ransom
being
provided
and
accepted
the
requirements
of
justice
are
met
for
those
contracts
are
provided
and
sanctioned
by
the
highest
contracting
parties
that
can
be
found
in
the
heavens
and
the
strongest
most
indubitable
and
infinite
assurances
are
given
for
the
fulfilment
of
that
contract
and
until
the
contract
is
fulfilled
the
sacrifices
are
offered
as
a
token
and
remembrance
of
the
engagements
and
covenants
entered
into
god
gave
a
token
to
noah
of
a
rainbow
which
should
be
a
sign
between
him
and
mankind
that
he
would
nevermore
destroy
the
earth
by
water
he
accepted
these
sacrifices
as
a
token
of
the
covenant
that
the
messiah
should
come
to
take
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
and
thus
fulfil
the
covenant
pertaining
to
this
matter
made
before
the
world
was
and
again
there
was
another
token
which
was
given
to
adam
by
an
angel
this
holy
messenger
said
to
our
great
father
thou
shalt
do
all
that
thou
doest
in
the
name
of
the
son
and
thou
shalt
repent
and
call
upon
god
in
the
name
of
the
son
for
evermore
pearl
of
great
price
for
as
expressed
in
the
new
testament
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
saved
acts
iv
or
to
quote
from
the
book
of
mormon
there
shall
be
no
other
name
given
nor
any
other
way
nor
means
whereby
salvation
can
come
unto
the
children
of
men
only
in
and
through
the
name
of
christ
the
lord
omnipotent
and
furthermore
that
name
or
token
will
continue
to
be
given
until
the
scripture
is
fulfilled
which
saith
wherefore
god
also
hath
highly
exalted
him
and
given
him
a
name
which
is
above
every
name
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
shall
bow
of
things
in
heaven
and
things
in
earth
and
things
under
the
earth
and
that
every
tongue
should
confess
that
jesus
christ
is
lord
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
ii
again
the
lord
through
the
sprinkling
of
the
blood
of
a
lamb
on
the
of
the
israelites
having
saved
the
lives
of
all
the
of
israel
made
a
claim
upon
them
for
their
services
in
his
cause
it
is
written
and
i
behold
i
have
taken
the
levites
from
among
the
children
of
israel
instead
of
all
the
that
openeth
the
matrix
among
the
children
of
israel
therefore
the
levites
shall
be
mine
because
all
the
are
mine
for
on
the
day
that
i
smote
all
the
in
the

i
hallowed
unto
me

but
the
of
the
egyptians
for
whom
no
lamb
as
a
token
of
the
propitiation
was
offered
were
destroyed
it
was
through
the
propitiation
and
atonement
alone
that
the
israelites
were
saved
and
under
the
circumstances
they
must
have
perished
with
the
egyptians
who
were
doomed
had
it
not
been
for
the
contemplated
atonement
and
propitiation
of
christ
of
which
this
was
a
figure
hence
the
lord
claimed
those
that
he
saved
as
righteously
belonging
to
him
and
claiming
them
as
his
he
demanded
their
services
but
afterwards
as
shown
in
the
above
quotation
he
accepted
the
tribe
of
levi
in
lieu
of
the
of
israel
and
as
there
were
more
of
the
than
there
were
of
the
levites
the
balance
had
to
be
redeemed
with
money

was

history
of

and
the
law
of

among
the
nephites
references
to
the
books
of
nephi
jacob
mosiah
and
alma
the
testimony
of
jesus
regarding
the
law
of
moses
from
the
bible
we
turn
to
the
book
of
mormon
with
a
view
to
discover
to
what
extent
the
law
of
sacrifice
as
a
type
of
the
offering
up
of
the
promised
messiah
was
observed
among
that
branch
of
the
house
of
israel
which
god
planted
on
this
continent
in
perusing
the
pages
of
this
sacred
record
we
shall
find
several
important
facts
and
ideas
in
connection
with
this
subject
presented
very
prominently
by
the
ancient
nephite
historians
among
them
first
that
the
law
of
moses
with
all
its
rites
ordinances
and
sacrifices
was
strictly
observed
by
the
faithful
nephites
from
the
time
of
their
arrival
on
the
promised
land
until
it
was
fulfilled
in
christ
and
by
his
command
ceased
to
be
observed
second
that
when
the
nephites
brought
any
of
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledge
and
worship
of
the
true
god
they
taught
them
to
observe
this
law
third
that
those
who
apostatized
from
the
nephites
as
a
general
thing
ceased
to
observe
this
law
fourth
that
the
true
import
of
the
law
of
moses
and
of
its
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
as
typical
of
the
atonement
yet
to
be
made
by
our
lord
and
savior
was
thoroughly
taught
by
the
priesthood
among
that
people
and
very
generally
understood
by
them
fifth
that
associated
with
the
observance
of
this
law
there
were
continued
admonitions
given
that
salvation
was
in
christ
and
not
in
the
law
which
was
but
the
shadow
and
type
of
that
of
which
he
was
the
prototype
and
reality
sixth
that
temples
were
erected
of
the
same
pattern
as
that
of
solomon
at
jerusalem
evidently
for
the
reason
that
they
were
to
be
used
for
the
same
purposes
seventh
that
the
gospel
was
preached
in
connection
with
the
law
and
churches
were
established
and
organized
according
to
the
gospel
requirements
and
that
the
higher
priesthood
although
not
fully
organized
in
all
its
parts
ministered
to
the
nephites
as
well
as
the
lesser
eighth
it
appears
indubitable
from
the
two
records
the
bible
and
the
book
of
mormon
that
the
intent
and
true
meaning
of
the
law
of
moses
of
its
sacrifices
were
far
better
understood
and
comprehended
by
the
nephites
than
by
the
jews
but
in
this
connection
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
a
great
many
most
plain
and
precious
things
as
the
book
of
mormon
states
have
been
taken
from
the
bible
through
the
ignorance
of
uninspired
translators
or
the
design
and
cunning
of
wicked
men
as
might
naturally
be
expected
we
find
that
lehi
like
his
forefathers
of
the
mosaic
age
offered
sacrifices
to
the
lord
during
his
journeyings
in
the
wilderness
these
sacrifices
were
occasions
of
thanksgiving
and
praise
to
god
as
examples
we
note
the
occasion
of
the
safe
return
of
lehi
sons
from
jerusalem
with
the
records
when
we
are
told
by
nephi
their
parents
did
rejoice
exceedingly
and
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
and
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
god
of
israel
and
after
they
had
given
thanks
unto
the
god
of
israel
my
father
lehi
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
and
he
did
search
them
from
the
beginning
nephi
v
another
occasion
was
when
nephi
and
his
brethren
again
returned
from
the
holy
city
bringing
with
them
ishmael
and
his
family
of
this
nephi
writes
after
i
and
my
brethren
and
all
the
house
of
ishmael
had
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
my
father
they
did
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
they
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
him
nephi
vii
after
the
arrival
of
the
colony
on
the
promised
land
and
the
death
of
lehi
his
sons
and
their
families
divided
into
two
communities
or
nationalities
the
one
righteous
and
godfearing
the
other
rebellious
and
debased
owing
to
the
contentious
and
quarrelsome
disposition
of
the
latter
who
recognized
laman
lehi
eldest
son
as
their
head
the
portion
who
sought
to
serve
the
lord
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
security
moved
some
distance
to
the
northward
nephi
was
their
leader
and
of
them
he
records
and
all
those
who
were
with
me
did
take
upon
them
to
call
themselves
the
people
of
nephi
and
we
did
observe
to
keep
the
judgments
and
the
statutes
and
the
commandments
of
the
lord
in
all
things
according
to
the
law
of
moses
and
the
lord
was
with
us
and
we
did
prosper
exceedingly
nephi
v
one
of
the
first
things
that
the
nephites
did
on
their
arrival
at
their
new
home
was
to
build
a
temple
they
could
not
keep
the
judgments
the
commandments
and
the
statutes
of
the
lord
in
all
things
according
to
the
law
of
moses
unless
they
did
so
and
necessarily
it
was
fashioned
after
the
one
at
jerusalem
for
it
was
to
be
used
for
the
same
purposes
in
it
the
same
ordinances
were
to
be
performed
the
same
sacrifices
were
to
be
offered
nephi
writes
and
i
nephi
did
build
a
temple
and
i
did
construct
it
after
the
manner
of
the
temple
of
solomon
save
it
were
not
built
of
so
many
precious
things
for
they
were
not
to
be
found
upon
the
land
wherefore
it
could
not
be
built
like
unto
solomon
temple
but
the
manner
of
the
construction
was
like
unto
the
temple
of
solomon
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
nephi
v
thus
the
fulfilling
of
the
divine
commandments
was
provided
for
a
place
was
erected
where
the
law
of
moses
could
be
carried
out
and
the
sacrifices
be
offered
which
formed
so
important
a
part
of
that
code
the
nephites
were
not
left
by
their
priesthood
in
ignorance
of
the
intent
and
symbolism
of
these
ceremonies
they
were
not
unmeaning
burdensome
spiritless
performances
to
them
nephi
and
his
successors
were
particularly
careful
in
explaining
that
these
ordinances
like
all
other
rites
of
the
church
of
god
had
their
value
in
their
association
with
or
being
directly
typical
of
the
great
infinite
sacrifice
of
atonement
to
be
offered
up
by
the
lamb
of
god
in
his
own
person
nephi
informs
us
behold
my
soul
delighteth
in
proving
unto
my
people
the
truth
of
the
coining
of
christ
for
for
this
end
hath
the
law
of
moses
been
given
and
all
things
which
have
been
given
of
god
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
unto
man
are
the
typifying
of
him
nephi
xi
and
a
little
later
he
writes
and
notwithstanding
we
believe
in
christ
we
keep
the
law
of
moses
and
look
forward
with
steadfastness
unto
christ
until
the
law
shall
be
fulfilled
for
for
this
end
was
the
law
given
wherefore
the
law
hath
become
dead
unto
us
and
we
are
made
alive
in
christ
because
of
our
faith
yet
we
keep
the
law
because
of
the
commandments
and
we
talk
of
christ
we
rejoice
in
christ
we
preach
of
christ
we
prophesy
of
christ
and
we
write
according
to
our
prophecies
that
our
children
may
know
to
what
source
they
may
look
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
wherefore
we
speak
concerning
the
law
that
our
children
may
know
the
deadness
of
the
law
and
they
by
knowing
the
deadness
of
the
law
may
look
forward
to
the
life
which
is
in
christ
and
know
for
what
end
the
law
was
given
and
after
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
christ
that
they
need
not
harden
their
hearts
against
him
when
the
law
ought
to
be
done
away
nephi
xxv
which
agrees
with
the
statement
of
paul
wherefore
the
law
was
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
unto
christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
so
firm
a
foundation
having
been
laid
for
the
faith
of
the
nephite
people
we
find
that
in
every
period
of
their
history
they
retained
their
reverence
for
the
law
of
moses
though
disputations
sometimes
arose
by
reason
of
iniquity
with
regard
to
its
symbolism
or
its
saving
quality
the
apostates
who
separated
themselves
from
the
church
occasionally
fell
into
the
grievous
error
ef
exalting
the
law
above
the
gospel
and
whilst
maintaining
its
divine
origin
they
ignored
its
typical
value
and
denied
that
it
was
a
preparatory
system
leading
to
a
higher
holier
and
more
perfect
law
they
refused
to
recognize
it
as
a
schoolmaster
to
bring
them
to
christ
the
first
of
these
apostacies
occurred
in
the
days
of
jacob
the
brother
of
nephi
with
regard
to
the
people
in
general
he
writes
behold
they
believed
in
christ
and
worshipped
the
father
in
his
name
and
also
we
worship
the
father
in
his
name
and
for
this
intent
we
keep
the
law
of
moses
it
pointing
our
souls
to
him
and
for
this
cause
it
is
sanctified
unto
us
for
righteousness
even
as
it
was
accounted
unto
abraham
in
the
wilderness
to
be
obedient
unto
the
commandments
of
god
in
offering
up
his
son
isaac
which
is
a
similitude
of
god
and
his
only
begotten
son
jacob
iv
but
while
the
majority
of
the
nephites
fully
recognized
these
saving
truths
there
arose
a
man
named
sherem
who
disputed
and
denied
that
the
law
pointed
the
souls
of
men
to
christ
as
the
great
propitiator
for
sin
and
the
redeemer
of
the
world
this
sherem
declared
unto
the
people
that
there
should
be
no
christ
and
his
flatteries
and
sophistries
led
away
many
people
of
him
and
his
doings
jacob
writes
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
unto
me
and
on
this
wise
did
he
speak
unto
me
saying
brother
jacob
i
have
sought
much
opportunity
that
i
might
speak
unto
you
for
i
have
heard
and
also
know
that
thou
goest
about
much
preaching
that
which
you
call
the
gospel
or
the
doctrine
of
christ
and
ye
have
led
away
much
of
this
people
that
they
pervert
the
right
way
of
god
and
keep
not
the
law
of
moses
which
is
the
right
way
and
convert
the
law
of
moses
into
the
worship
of
a
being
which
ye
say
shall
come
many
hundred
years
hence
and
now
behold
i
sherem
declare
unto
you
that
this
is
blasphemy
for
no
man
knoweth
of
such
things
for
he
can
not
tell
of
things
to
come
and
after
this
manner
did
sherem
contend
against
me
but
behold
the
lord
god
poured
in
his
spirit
into
my
soul
insomuch
that
i
did
confound
him
in
all
his
words
and
i
said
unto
him
deniest
thou
the
christ
who
should
come
and
he
said
if
there
should
be
a
christ
i
would
not
deny
him
but
i
know
that
there
is
no
christ
neither
has
been
nor
ever
will
be
and
i
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
scriptures
and
he
said
yea
and
i
said
unto
him
then
ye
do
not
understand
them
for
they
truly
testify
of
christ
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
none
of
the
prophets
have
written
nor
prophesied
save
they
have
spoken
concerning
this
christ
and
this
is
not
all
it
has
been
made
manifest
unto
me
for
i
have
heard
and
seen
and
it
also
has
been
made
manifest
unto
me
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
wherefore
i
know
if
there
should
be
no
atonement
made
all
mankind
must
be
lost
jacob
vii
somewhat
similar
was
the
argument
that
took
place
between
the
martyr
abinadi
and
the
apostate
priests
of
the
iniquitous
noah
king
of
the
land
of
they
officiated
in
the
temple
observed
the
outward
forms
of
the
mosaic
law
but
revelled
in
licentiousness
covetousness
gluttony
and
all
manner
of
iniquity
to
them
was
abinadi
sent
to
warn
them
and
their
king
of
the
results
of
their
mutual
wrong
doing
in
the
account
of
this
mission
of
abinadi
we
read
that
he
said
ye
have
not
applied
your
hearts
to
understanding
therefore
ye
have
not
been
wise
therefore
what
teach
ye
this
people
and
they
said
we
teach
the
law
of
moses
and
again
he
said
unto
them
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
why
do
ye
not
keep
it
why
do
ye
set
your
hearts
upon
riches
why
do
ye
commit
whoredoms
and
spend
your
strength
with
harlots
yea
and
cause
this
people
to
commit
sin
that
the
lord
has
cause
to
send
me
to
prophesy
against
this
people
yea
even
a
great
evil
against
this
people
know
ye
not
that
i
speak
the
truth
yea
ye
know
that
i
speak
the
truth
and
you
ought
to
tremble
before
god
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
be
smitten
for
your
iniquities
for
ye
have
said
that
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
and
what
know
ye
concerning
the
law
of
moses
does
salvation
come
by
the
law
of
moses
what
say
ye
and
they
answered
and
said
that
salvation
did
come
by
the
law
of
moses
but
now
abinadi
said
unto
them
i
know
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shall
be
saved
yea
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
which
the
lord
delivered
unto
moses
in
the
mount
of
sinai
xii
he
then
rehearsed
to
them
the
commandments
after
which
he
again
inquired
have
ye
taught
this
people
that
they
should
observe
to
do
all
these
things
for
to
keep
these
commandments
i
say
unto
you
nay
for
if
ye
had
the
lord
would
not
have
caused
me
to
come
forth
and
to
prophesy
evil
concerning
this
people
and
now
ye
have
said
that
salvation
cometh
by
the
law
of
moses
i
say
unto
you
that
it
is
expedient
that
ye
should
keep
the
law
of
moses
as
yet
but
i
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
when
it
shall
no
more
be
expedient
to
keep
the
law
of
moses
and
moreover
i
say
unto
you
that
salvation
doth
not
come
by
the
law
alone
and
were
it
not
for
the
atonement
which
god
himself
shall
make
for
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
his
people
that
they
must
unavoidably
perish
notwithstanding
the
law
of
moses
and
now
i
say
unto
you
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
law
given
to
the
children
of
israel
yea
even
a
very
strict
law
for
they
were
a
people
quick
to
do
iniquity
and
slow
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
therefore
there
was
a
law
given
them
yea
a
law
of
performances
and
of
ordinances
a
law
which
they
were
to
observe
strictly
from
day
to
day
to
keep
them
in
remembrance
of
god
and
their
duty
towards
him
but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
all
these
things
were
types
of
things
to
come
and
now
did
they
understand
the
law
i
say
unto
you
nay
they
did
not
all
understand
the
law
and
this
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
for
they
understood
not
that
there
could
not
any
man
be
saved
except
it
were
through
the
redemption
of
god
for
behold
did
not
moses
prophesy
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
the
messiah
and
that
god
should
redeem
his
people
yea
and
even
all
the
prophets
who
have
prophesied
ever
since
the
world
began
have
they
not
spoken
more
or
less
concerning
these
things
xiii
at
this
time
the
righteous
nephites
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
were
keeping
the
law
of
moses
strictly
so
far
as
its
outward
ordinances
were
concerned
and
understandingly
with
regard
to
its
symbolism
and
similitudes
when
the
obedient
nephites
were
led
out
of
the
land
of
nephi
by
mosiah
they
found
in
the
land
afterwards
called
zarahemla
a
people
who
proved
to
be
a
branch
of
the
house
of
israel
but
who
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
had
no
records
nor
scriptures
had
corrupted
their
language
failed
to
observe
the
law
of
moses
and
had
so
far
fallen
that
they
actually
denied
the
existence
of
god
mosiah
and
the
nephites
amalgamated
with
this
people
taught
them
their
language
instructed
them
in
the
worship
of
god
and
built
a
temple
in
that
land
which
indeed
they
made
their
permanent
home
mosiah
had
a
son
called
benjamin
who
ruled
in
righteousness
all
the
days
of
his
long
life
shortly
before
his
death
he
instructed
his
son
mosiah
to
gather
the
people
to
the
temple
that
he
might
give
them
a
charge
and
nominate
his
successor
it
is
written
after
mosiah
had
done
as
his
father
had
commanded
him
and
had
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
the
land
that
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
throughout
all
the
land
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
words
which
king
benjamin
should
speak
unto
them
and
there
were
a
great
number
even
so
many
that
they
did
not
number
them
for
they
had
multiplied
exceedingly
and
waxed
great
in
the
land
and
they
also
took
of
the
firstlings
of
their
flocks
that
they
might
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
according
to
the
law
of
moses
ii
here
we
observe
that
the
law
in
relation
to
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
was
still
faithfully
observed
although
nearly
five
hundred
years
had
passed
since
lehi
left
jerusalem
for
the
colony
which
he
led
started
on
their
eventful
journey
six
hundred
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
whilst
this
gathering
took
place
one
hundred
and
years
before
that
same
most
important
appearing
during
the
days
that
the
judges
ruled
the
nephites
the
righteous
portion
of
that
people
continued
to
observe
the
requirements
of
this
law
we
will
simply
give
two
quotations
from
the
book
of
alma
on
this
point
though
the
references
are
numerous
the
first
is
yea
and
they
did
keep
the
law
of
moses
for
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
keep
the
law
of
moses
as
yet
for
it
was
not
all
fulfilled
but
notwithstanding
the
law
of
moses
they
did
look
forward
to
the
coming
of
christ
considering
that
the
law
of
moses
was
a
type
of
his
coming
and
believing
that
they
must
keep
those
outward
performances
until
the
time
that
he
should
be
revealed
unto
them
now
they
did
not
suppose
that
salvation
came
by
the
law
of
moses
but
the
law
of
moses
did
serve
to
strengthen
their
faith
in
christ
and
thus
they
did
retain
a
hope
through
faith
unto
eternal
salvation
relying
upon
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
spake
of
those
things
to
come
alma
xxv
with
this
the
words
of
paul
when
speaking
on
this
subject
precisely
agree
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
under
the

this

the
whole

of
the

that
great

but
some
of
those
who
apostatized
from
the
nephites
and
organized
churches
of
their
own
ceased
to
keep
this
law
such
a
sect
were
the
zoramites
of
whom
it
is
written
now
the
zoramites
were
dissenters
from
the
nephites
therefore
they
had
the
word
of
god
preached
unto
them
but
they
had
fallen
into
great
errors
for
they
would
not
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
his
statutes
according
to
the
law
of
moses
neither
would
they
observe
the
performances
of
the
church
to
continue
in
prayer
and
supplication
to
god
daily
that
they
might
not
enter
into
temptation
yea
in
fine
they
did
pervert
the
ways
of
the
lord
in
very
many
instances
alma
xxxi
shortly
after
the
appearance
of
the
signs
that
betokened
the
birth
of
the
savior
at
bethlehem
there
arose
a
few
among
the
nephites
who
endeavored
to
prove
by
the
scriptures
that
it
was
no
more
expedient
to
observe
the
law
of
moses
now
in
this
thing
they
did
err
having
not
understood
the
scriptures
but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
soon
became
converted
and
were
convinced
of
the
error
which
they
were
in
for
it
was
made
known
unto
them
that
the
law
was
not
yet
fulfilled
nephi
i
after
his
resurrection
jesus
in
his
ministrations
in
the
midst
of
the
nephites
perceiving
that
they
wondered
regarding
the
fulfilment
of
the
law
of
moses
said
unto
the
listening
multitude
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
the
law
is
fulfilled
that
was
given
unto
moses
behold
i
am
he
that
gave
the
law
and
i
am
he
who
covenanted
with
my
people
israel
therefore
the
law
in
me
is
fulfilled
for
i
have
come
to
fulfil
the
law
therefore
it
hath
an
end
behold
i
do
not
destroy
the
prophets
for
as
many
as
have
not
been
fulfilled
in
me
verily
i
say
unto
you
shall
all
be
fulfilled
and
because
i
said
unto
you
that
old
things
hath
passed
away
i
do
not
destroy
that
which
hath
been
spoken
concerning
things
which
are
to
come
for
behold
the
covenant
which
i
have
made
with
my
people
is
not

when

of
the

in

will
offer
up
an
acceptable
offering
unto
the
lord
what
this
offering
will
be
does
not
distinctly
appear
there
are
many
things
associated
with
the
final
salvation
of
man
and
the
working
out
and
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
of
god
in
relation
to
the
human
family
which
lie
yet
in
the
future
the
peculiar
position
which
the
children
will
occupy
also
the
position
of
the
heathen
who
have
died
without
law
and
of
those
who
have
been
translated
and
who
it
would
appear
have
a
specified
labor
to
perform
associated
with
their
mission
to
the
terrestrial
worlds
the
letting
loose
of
satan
after
the
thousand
years
and
many
other
things
which
it
is
not
permitted
for
us
at
the
present
time
to
comprehend
in
full
these
will
all
be
revealed
in
the
due
time
of
the
lord
the
prophet
joseph
makes
the
following
statement
with
regard
to
the
offerings
above
referred
to
thus
we
behold
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
consisted
in
obtaining
the
voice
of
jehovah
that
he
talked
with
him
noah
in
a
familiar
and
friendly
manner
that
he
continued
to
him
the
keys
the
covenants
the
power
and
the
glory
with
which
he
blessed
adam
at
the
beginning
and
the
offering
of
sacrifice
which
also
shall
be
continued
at
the
last
time
for
all
the
ordinances
and
duties
that
ever
have
been
required
by
the
priesthood
under
the
directions
and
commandments
of
the
almighty
in
any
of
the
dispensations
shall
all
be
had
in
the
last
dispensation
therefore
all
things
had
under
the
authority
of
the
priesthood
at
any
former
period
shall
be
had
again
bringing
to
pass
the
restoration
spoken
of
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
holy
prophets
then
shall
the
sons
of
levi
offer
an
acceptable
sacrifice
to
tho
lord
see
malachi
iii
he
shall
sit
as
a
refiner
and
purifier
of
silver
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
levi
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
lord
it
will
be
necessary
here
to
make
a
few
observations
on
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
the
above
quotation
as
it
is
generally
supposed
that
sacrifice
was
entirely
done
away
when
the
great
sacrifice
was
offered
up
and
that
there
will
be
no
necessity
for
the
ordinance
of
sacrifice
in
future
but
those
who
assert
this
are
certainly
not
acquainted
with
the
duties
privileges
and
authority
of
the
priesthood
or
with
the
prophets
the
offering
of
sacrifice
has
ever
been
connected
with
and
forms
a
part
of
the
duties
of
the
priesthood
it
began
with
the
priesthood
and
will
be
continued
until
after
the
coming
of
christ
from
generation
to
generation
we
frequently
have
mention
made
of
the
offering
of
sacrifice
by
the
servants
of
the
most
high
in
ancient
days
prior
to
the
law
of
moses
which
ordinances
will
be
continued
when
the
priesthood
is
restored
with
all
its
authority
power
and
blessings
elijah
was
the
last
prophet
that
held
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
and
who
will
before
the
last
dispensation
restore
the
authority
and
deliver
the
keys
of
this
priesthood
in
order
that
all
the
ordinances
may
be
attended
to
in
righteousness
it
is
true
that
the
savior
had
authority
and
power
to
bestow
this
blessing
but
the
sons
of
levi
were
too
prejudiced
i
will
send
elijah
the
prophet
before
the
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord
etc
why
send
elijah
because
he
holds
the
keys
of
the
authority
to
administer
in
all
the
ordinances
of
the
priesthood
and
without
the
authority
is
given
the
ordinances
could
not
be
administered
in
righteousness
it
is
a
very
prevalent
opinion
that
the
sacrifices
which
were
offered
were
entirely
consumed
this
was
not
the
case
if
you
read
leviticus
second
chapter
second
and
third
verses
you
will
observe
that
the
priest
took
a
part
as
a
memorial
and
offered
it
up
before
the
lord
while
the
remainder
was
kept
for
the
maintenance
of
the
priests
so
that
the
offerings
and
sacrifices
are
not
all
consumed
upon
the
altar
but
the
blood
is
sprinkled
and
the
fat
and
certain
other
portions
are
consumed
these
sacrifices
as
well
as
every
ordinance
belonging
to
the
priesthood
will
when
the
temple
of
the
lord
shall
be
built
and
the
sons
of
levi
be
purified
be
fully
restored
and
attended
to
in
all
their
powers
ramifications
and
blessings
this
ever
did
and
will
exist
when
the
powers
of
the
melchizedek
priesthood
are
sufficiently
manifest
else
how
can
the
restitution
of
all
things
spoken
of
by
all
the
holy
prophets
be
brought
to
pass
it
is
not
to
be
understood
that
the
law
of
moses
will
be
established
again
with
all
its
rites
and
variety
of
ceremonies
this
has
never
been
spoken
of
by
the
prophets
but
those
things
which
existed
prior
to
moses
day
namely
sacrifice
will
be
continued
it
may
be
asked
by
some
what
necessity
for
sacrifice
since
the
great
sacrifice
was
offered
in
answer
to
which
if
repentance
baptism
and
faith
existed
prior
to
the
days
of
christ
what
necessity
for
them
since
that
time
the
priesthood
has
descended
in
a
regular
line
from
father
to
son
through
their
succeeding
generations
see

of

and
covenants

no
the
remarks
of
president
joseph
smith
are
very
plain
and
explicit
and
are
a
strong
confirmation
of
the
passage
he
himself
refers
to
pertaining
to
the
times
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
which
will
embrace
all
systems
doctrines
ordinances
dispensations
and
priesthoods
connected
with
the
church
and
kingdom
of
god
that
there
will
be
a
full
manifestation
of
all
these
things
relating
to
the
various
times
and
dispensations
is
assured
yet
as
joseph
smith
has
very
properly
said
the
details
of
those
rituals
and
observances
can
not
now
be
fully
defined
but
as
ancient
israel
preserved
in
the
ark
of
the
covenant
memorials
of
god
power
goodness
and
mercy
manifested
during
the
exodus
from
egypt
in
the
two
tables
of
stone
and
the
pot
of
manna
and
of
the
recognition
of
the
aaronic
priesthood
in
aaron
rod
that
budded
and
as
the
sword
of
laban
the
sacred
plates
already
revealed
as
well
as
numerous
others
yet
to
be
made
manifest
and
a
urim
and
thummim
were
preserved
on
this
continent
so
will
there
be
an
exhibition
an
evidence
a
memorial
and
an
actual
manifestation
of
matters
pertaining
to
laws
ordinances
ceremonies
and
dispensations
from
the
commencement
of
the
world
to
the
present
time
preserved
and
manifested
in
the
dispensation
that
the
lord
in
his
loving
kindness
has
now
inaugurated
this
will
be
in
accordance
with
the
eternal
plans
and
purposes
of
god
and
with
the
rights
ceremonies
and
ordinances
belonging
to
the
priesthoods
of
god
in
the
different
ages
pertaining
to
the
organization
of
this
world
the
proposed
mediation
and
atonement
of
the
son
of
god
the
manifestations
and
developments
of
the
melchizedek
priesthood
as
the
prophet
joseph
has
referred
to
as
well
relating
to
sacrifices
in
early
days
as
in
other
matters
the
introduction
of
the
aaronic
priesthood
together
with
the
ark
and
the
tabernacle
which
we
are
told
were
made
after
the
patterns
shown
unto
moses
in
the
mount
patterns
which
existed
in
the
heavens
the
eternal
existence
authority
and
power
of
both
priesthoods
as
connected
with
god
and
administering
in
time
and
eternity
the
attempts
of
satan
to
overthrow
the
dynasty
power
and
authority
of
jehovah
and
his
complete
failure
and
discomfiture
exhibiting
in
a
panorama
all
the
leading
prominent
details
of
the
creation
atonement
redemption
salvation
and
exaltation
of
the
world
and
man
the
organization
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
and
all
the
purposes
of
god
his
plans
and
ordinances
manifested
through
the
priesthood
from
the
first
inception
of
the
organization
of
the
world
to
the
final
consummation
purification
and
exaltation
of
the
world
and
its
inhabitants
according
to
the
foreknowledge
and
determinate
counsel
of
the
almighty
for
as
these
memorials
of
the
atonement
were
used
by
the
ancient
patriarchs
and
prophets
to
manifest
to
god
their
faith
in
the
plan
of
redemption
and
in
the
coming
redeemer
so
will
these
great
types
be
again
introduced
as
exhibiting
the
sacrifice
of
the
great
antitype
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
and
as
a
perpetual
recognition
of
the
eternal
salvation
and
exaltation
wrought
out
by
him
for
the
human

by
the

to

the

as
before
stated
these
sacrifices
which
were
offered
up
from
the
days
of
adam
until
the
time
of
our
savior
advent
were
typical
of
the
great
expiatory
sacrifice
which
he
was
to
make
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
they
were
so
many
types
shadows
and
forms
of
which
he
was
the
great
prototype
the
substance
the
reality
prefigured
and
foreshadowed
by
the
other
sacrifices
which
had
been
offered
up
from
the
beginning
when
the
law
was
given
by
moses
all
the
forms
pertaining
to
the
sacrificial
ceremonies
were
revealed
in
detail
and
the
instructions
in
relation
thereto
were
not
simply
of
a
general
nature
but
they
entered
into
minute
particulars
in
relation
to
all
things
connected
with
those
who
officiated
the
form
and
pattern
of
the
sacred
utensils
and
of
the
vestments
of
the
priesthood
the
creatures
to
be
sacrificed
the
order
of
the
proceedings
and
indeed
of
all
matters
associated
with
the
observance
of
these
rites
almost
the
whole
of
the
book
of
leviticus
and
considerable
of
the
book
of
numbers
is
occupied
with
these
instructions
and
kindred
matters
this
mosaic
law
with
all
its
duties
observances
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
continued
in
force
until
christ
death
the
time
having
come
when
the
great
atonement
should
be
made
by
the
offering
up
of
himself
christ
told
peter
and
john
to
go
and
prepare
a
place
where
he
might
according
to
his
custom
eat
the
passover
with
his
disciples
eat
what
with
his
disciples
the
passover
was
it
the
passover
or
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
the
lord
in
egypt
passed
by
or
passed
over
the
houses
of
the
israelites
whose
door
posts
had
been
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
the
lamb
sacrificed
for
that
purpose
and
the
israelites
were
commanded
to
observe
this
passover
in
all
their
generations
jesus
in
compliance
with
this
command
directed
that
a
place
be
made
ready
where
he
might
eat
the
passover
with
his
apostles
for
he
the
great
prototype
was
going
to
offer
up
himself
as
a
lamb
without
spot
or
blemish
not
only
for
the
israelites
but
for
all
nations
for
every
people
and
kindred
and
tongue
under
the
face
of
the
whole
heavens
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
for
god
sent
not
his
son
into
the
world
to
condemn
the
world
but
that
the
world
through
him
might
be
saved
but
previous
to
the
offering
up
of
himself
as
the
great
expiatory
sacrifice
having
fulfilled
the
law
and
made
it
honorable
and
having
introduced
the
gospel
he
met
with
his
disciples
as
already
noticed
to
eat
the
passover
he
then
told
them
with
desire
i
have
desired
to
eat
this
passover
with
you
before
i
suffer
to
eat
what
with
you
the
passover
to
eat
what
with
you
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
thus
he
eat
both
for
the
two
ceremonies
centered
in
him
he
was
the
embodiment
of
both
he
was
the
being
provided
before
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
prophesied
of
by
men
of
god
throughout
all
the
preceding
ages
and
also
on
account
of
whom
the
sacrifices
were
offered
up
by
all
the
servants
of
the
lord
from
the
fall
of
adam
to
that
time
and
all
the
various
atonements
heretofore
offered
pointed
to
him
for
whom
they
were
all
made
and
in
whom
they
all
centered
on
the
other
hand
he
it
was
who
introduced
the
more
perfect
law
and
offering
himself
once
for
all
an
infinite
atonement
he
through
this
sacrifice
accomplished
that
which
was
designed
by
the
almighty
before
the
world
was
and
of
which
the
blood
of
bullocks
of
goats
and
of
lambs
was
merely
the
shadow
in
view
of
what
was
almost
immediately
to
take
place
he
instituted
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
in
commemoration
of
this
great
crowning
act
of
redemption
when
at
the
table
he
took
bread
and
gave
thanks
and
brake
it
and
gave
unto
them
saying
this
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
afterwards
he
took
the
cup
and
gave
thanks
and
gave
it
to
them
saying
drink
ye
all
of
it
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
in
reality
this
act
of
the
atonement
was
the
fulfilment
of
the
sacrifices
of
the
prophesying
of
the
passover
and
of
all
the
leading
prominent
acts
of
the
patriarchs
and
prophets
relating
thereto
and
having
performed
this
the
past
and
the
future
both
centered
in
him
did
these
worthies
offer
sacrifices
they
prefigured
his
appearing
and
atonement
did
they
prophecy
it
was
of
him
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy
did
they
keep
the
passover
he
himself
was
the
great
expiatory
offering
were
the
people
called
upon
afterwards
to
commemorate
this
event
they
did
it
in
remembrance
of
him
as
a
great
memorial
among
all
of
his
disciples
in
all
nations
throughout
all
time
of
the
sacrifice
of
his
broken
body
and
spilt
blood
the
antitype
of
the
sacrificial
lamb
slain
at
the
time
of
the
passover
of
him
as
being
the
mediator
the
messiah
the
christ
the
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
son
of
the
living
god
as
from
the
commencement
of
the
world
to
the
time
when
the
passover
was
instituted
sacrifices
had
been
offered
as
a
memorial
or
type
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
so
from
the
time
of
the
passover
until
that
time
when
he
came
to
offer
up
himself
these
sacrifices
and
types
and
shadows
had
been
carefully
observed
by
prophets
and
patriarchs
according
to
the
command
given
to
moses
and
other
followers
of
the
lord
so
also
did
he
himself
fulfil
this
requirement
and
kept
the
passover
as
did
others
and
now
we
after
the
great
sacrifice
has
been
offered
partake
of
the
sacrament
of
the
supper
in
remembrance
thereof
thus
this
act
was
the
great
connecting
link
between
the
past
and
the
future
thus
he
fulfilled
the
law
met
the
demands
of
justice
and
obeyed
the
requirements
of
his
heavenly
father
although
laboring
under
the
weight
of
the
sins
of
the
world
and
the
terrible
expiation
which
he
had
to
make
when
sweating
great
drops
of
blood
he
cried
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
nevertheless
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
and
when
expiring
in
agony
upon
the
cross
he
cried
it
is
finished
and
gave
up
the
ghost
during
this
ever
memorable
supper
the
savior
said
unto
his
disciples
but
i
say
unto
you
i
will
not
drink
henceforth
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
until
that
day
when
i
drink
it
new
with
you
in
my
kingdom
he
was
the
lamb
proposed
to
be
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
he
was
the
lamb
spoken
of
by
the
prophets
in
the
different
ages
and
for
which
sacrifices
were
made
in
him
was
now
fulfilled
everything
that
prefigured
his
approach
and
that
was
prophesied
of
him
pertaining
to
the
atonement
he
also
was
to
burst
the
barriers
of
the
tomb
become
the
first
fruits
of
those
that
slept
and
introduce
the
resurrection
and
indeed
to
be
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
was
also
to
ascend
to
the
heavens
resurrect
his
saints
and
after
resurrecting
them
drink
of
the
fruit
of
the
vine
with
them
in
his
father
kingdom
every
knee
should
yet
bow
to
him
and
every
tongue
confess
that
he
was
the
christ
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
every
nation
kindred
and
tongue
should
bow
to
his
sceptre
and
the
earth
through
him
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
god
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
the
earth
be
redeemed
and
become
celestial
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
be
instituted
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
and
the
redemption
and
resurrection
of
the
living
and
the
dead
according
to
the
eternal
plan
of
jehovah
should
be
brought
about
through
his
mediation
and
atonement
chapter
xvii
the
atonement
and
the
resurrection
adam
and
christ
why
a
law
was
given
unto
adam
the
results
of
disobedience
to
that
law
testimony
of
our
first
parents
adam
fell
that
man
might
be
the
fall
a
necessary
part
of
the
plan
of
salvation
god
plan
a
merciful
plan
the
plan
of
lucifer
man
free
agency
the
chain
complete
in
the
economy
of
god
and
the
plan
proposed
by
the
almighty
it
was
provided
that
man
was
to
be
placed
under
a
law
apparently
simple
in
itself
yet
the
test
of
that
law
was
fraught
with
the
gravest
consequences
the
observance
of
that
law
would
secure
eternal
life
and
the
penalty
for
the
violation
of
that
law
was
death
for
we
are
told
in
adam
all
die
and
hence
the
declaration
it
is
appointed
for
man
once
to
die
there
is
another
principle
associated
with
this
which
is
that
the
atonement
provided
a
means
and
plan
whereby
death
could
be
overcome
and
the
resurrection
of
the
body
from
death
be
brought
about
for
it
is
written
as
in
adam
all
die
even
so
in
christ
shall
all
be
made
alive
but
without
this
atonement
the
resurrection
of
the
body
could
not
be
brought
about
hence
jesus
when
on
earth
proclaimed
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
and
he
himself
was
the
first
fruits
of
them
that
slept
men
could
not
have
been
tested
without
a
law
the
penalty
for
the
violation
of
that
law
was
death
if
the
law
had
not
been
broken
man
would
have
lived
but
would
man
thus
living
have
been
capable
of
perpetuating
his
species
and
of
thus
fulfilling
the
designs
of
god
in
preparing
tabernacles
for
the
spirits
which
had
been
created
in
the
spirit
world
and
further
could
they
have
had
the
need
of
a
mediator
who
was
to
act
as
a
propitiation
for
the
violation
of
this
law
which
it
would
appear
from
the
circumstances
was
destined
to
be
broken
or
could
the
eternal
increase
and
perpetuity
of
man
have
been
continued
and
his
high
exaltation
to
the
godhead
been
accomplished
without
the
propitiatory
atonement
and
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
jesus
said
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behooved
christ
to
suffer
could
it
have
behooved
christ
to
suffer
if
man
had
not
sinned
and
was
it
not
part
of
the
eternal
plan
of
god
that
man
should
violate
that
law
that
an
atonement
might
be
provided
and
had
and
by
this
means
man
be
purified
and
perfected
through
the
struggles
and
trials
incident
to
his
coming
in
contact
with
the
powers
of
darkness
and
through
the
mediation
and
atonement
of
jesus
christ
and
his
own
obedience
to
the
requirements
of
the
law
associated
therewith
be
raised
to
a
higher
state
of
existence
than
it
would
have
been
possible
for
him
to
have
obtained
without
the
transgression
of
that
law
these
points
are
made
exceedingly
plain
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
it
is
there
stated
and
adam
called
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
and
eve
also
his
wife
and
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
from
the
way
towards
the
garden
of
eden
speaking
unto
them
and
they
saw
him
not
for
they
were
shut
out
from
his
presence
and
he
gave
unto
them
commandments
that
they
should
worship
the
lord
their
god
and
should
offer
the
firstlings
of
their
flocks
for
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
adam
was
obedient
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
after
many
days
an
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
adam
saying
why
dost
thou
offer
sacrifices
unto
the
lord
and
adam
said
unto
him
i
know
not
save
the
lord
commanded
me
and
then
the
angel
spake
saying
this
thing
is
a
similitude
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
which
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
wherefore
thou
shalt
do
all
that
thou
doest
in
the
name
of
the
son
and
thou
shalt
repent
and
call
upon
god
in
the
name
of
the
son
for
evermore
and
in
that
day
the
holy
ghost
fell
upon
adam
which
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
the
son
saying
i
am
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
from
the
beginning
henceforth
and
for
ever
that
as
thou
hast
fallen
thou
mayest
be
redeemed
and
all
mankind
even
as
many
as
will
and
in
that
day
adam
blessed
god
and
was
filled
and
began
to
prophesy
concerning
all
the
families
of
the
earth
saying
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
for
because
of
my
transgression
my
eyes
are
opened
and
in
this
life
i
shall
have
joy
and
again
in
the
flesh
i
shall
see
god
and
eve
his
wife
heard
all
these
things
and
was
glad
saying
were
it
not
for
our
transgression
we
never
should
have
had
seed
and
never
should
have
known
good
and
evil
and
the
joy
of
our
redemption
and
the
eternal
life
which
god
giveth
unto
all
the
obedient
and
adam
and
eve
blessed
the
name
of
god
and
they
made
all
things
known
unto
their
sons
and
their
daughters
thus
we
find
firstly
that
adam
and
eve
both
considered
that
they
had
gained
instead
of
suffered
loss
through
their
disobedience
to
that
law
for
they
made
the
statement
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
transgression
they
never
would
have
known
good
and
evil
and
again
they
would
have
been
incapable
of
increase
and
without
that
increase
the
designs
of
god
in
relation
to
the
formation
of
the
earth
and
man
could
not
have
been
accomplished
for
one
great
object
of
the
creation
of
the
world
was
the
propagation
of
the
human
species
that
bodies
might
be
prepared
for
those
spirits
who
already
existed
and
who
when
they
saw
the
earth
formed
shouted
for
joy
secondly
by
pursuing
the
course
they
did
through
the
atonement
they
would
see
god
as
they
had
done
before
and
furthermore
they
would
be
capable
of
exaltation
which
was
made
possible
only
through
their
fall
and
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
and
also
they
might
have
the
comforting
influence
of
the
spirit
of
god
and
his
guidance
and
direction
here
as
well
as
eternal
lives
and
exaltations
in
the
world
to
come
paul
in
his
epistle
to
the
romans
also
writes
very
directly
upon
these
truths
he
says
nevertheless
death
reigned
from
adam
to
moses
even
over
them
that
had
not
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
adam
transgression
who
is
the
figure
of
him
that
was
to
come
but
not
as
the
offence
so
also
is
the
free
gift
for
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
dead
much
more
the
grace
of
god
and
the
gift
by
grace
which
is
by
one
man
jesus
christ
hath
abounded
unto
many
and
not
as
it
was
by
one
that
sinned
so
is
the
gift
for
the
judgment
was
by
one
to
condemnation
but
the
free
gift
is
of
many
offences
unto
justification
for
if
by
one
man
offence
death
reigned
by
one
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righteousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
one
jesus
christ
therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
judgment
came
upon
all
men
to
condemnation
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
life
for
as
by
one
man
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
righteous
moreover
the
law
entered
that
the
offence
might
abound
but
where
sin
abounded
grace
did
much
more
abound
that
as
sin
hath
reigned
unto
death
even
so
might
grace
reign
through
righteousness
unto
eternal
life
by
jesus
christ
our
lord
romans
whilst
in
the
book
of
mormon
lehi
teaches
and
now
behold
if
adam
had
not
transgressed
he
would
not
have
fallen
but
he
would
have
remained
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
all
things
which
were
created
must
have
remained
in
the
same
state
which
they
were
after
they
were
created
and
they
must
have
remained
for
ever
and
had
no
end
and
they
would
have
had
no
children
wherefore
they
would
have
remained
in
a
state
of
innocence
having
no
joy
for
they
knew
no
misery
doing
no
good
for
they
knew
no
sin
but
behold
all
things
have
been
done
in
the
wisdom
of
him
who
knoweth
all
things
adam
fell
that
men
might
be
and
men
are
that
they
might
have
joy
and
the
messiah
cometh
in
the
fulness
of
time
that
he
may
redeem
the
children
of
men
from
the
fall
and
because
that
they
are
redeemed
from
the
fall
they
have
become
free
for
ever
knowing
good
from
evil
to
act
for
themselves
and
not
to
be
acted
upon
save
it
be
by
the
punishment
of
the
law
at
the
great
and
last
day
according
to
the
commandments
which
god
hath
given
wherefore
men
are
free
according
to
the
flesh
and
all
things
are
given
them
which
are
expedient
unto
man
and
they
are
free
to
choose
liberty
and
eternal
life
through
the
great
mediation
of
all
men
or
to
choose
captivity
and
death
according
to
the
captivity
and
power
of
the
devil
for
he
seeketh
that
all
men
might
be
miserable
like
unto
himself
nephi
ii
in
the
same
book
it
is
written
yea
i
know
that
ye
know
that
in
the
body
he
shall
show
himself
unto
those
at
jerusalem
from
whence
we
came
for
it
is
expedient
that
it
should
be
among
them
for
it
behooveth
the
great
creator
that
he
suffereth
himself
to
become
subject
unto
man
in
the
flesh
and
die
for
all
men
that
all
men
might
become
subject
unto
him
for
as
death
hath
passed
upon
all
men
to
fulfil
the
merciful
plan
of
the
great
creator
there
must
needs
be
a
power
of
resurrection
and
the
resurrection
must
needs
come
unto
man
by
reason
of
the
fall
and
the
fall
came
by
reason
of
transgression
and
because
man
became
fallen
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
an
infinite
atonement
save
it
should
be
an
infinite
atonement
this
corruption
could
not
put
on
incorruption
wherefore
the
first
judgment
which
came
upon
man
must
needs
have
remained
to
an
endless
duration
and
if
so
this
flesh
must
have
laid
down
to
rot
and
to
crumble
to
its
mother
earth
to
rise
no
more
o
the
wisdom
of
god
his
mercy
and
grace
for
behold
if
the
flesh
should
rise
no
more
our
spirits
must
become
subject
to
that
angel
who
fell
from
before
the
presence
of
the
eternal
god
and
became
the
devil
to
rise
no
more
nephi
ix
there
is
a
principle
developed
in
the
above
quotation
to
the
effect
that
death
was
passed
upon
all
men
to
fulfill
the
of
the
great
creator
and
furthermore
that
the
resurrection
came
by
reason
of
the
fall
for
if
man
had
not
sinned
there
would
have
been
no
death
and
if
jesus
had
not
atoned
for
the
sin
there
would
have
been
no
resurrection
hence
these
things
are
spoken
of
as
being
according
to
the
merciful
plan
of
god
this
corruption
could
not
have
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortality
could
not
have
put
on
immortality
for
as
we
have
elsewhere
shown
man
by
reason
of
any
thing
that
he
himself
could
do
or
accomplish
could
only
exalt
himself
to
the
dignity
and
capability
of
man
and
therefore
it
needed
the
atonement
of
a
god
before
man
through
the
adoption
could
be
exalted
to
the
godhead
again
if
the
body
could
not
have
been
resurrected
it
would
have
had
to
crumble
to
its
mother
earth
and
remain
in
that
condition
without
the
capability
of
ascending
to
the
godhead
and
furthermore
not
only
would
our
bodies
have
lost
their
entity
their
life
and
power
but
the
spirit
also
would
have
been
placed
in
a
state
of
subjection
to
that
angel
who
fell
from
before
the
presence
of
the
eternal
god
and
became
the
devil
without
a
capability
or
even
hope
of
life
salvation
and
exaltation
and
would
have
been
deprived
of
all
free
agency
and
power
and
subject
to
the
influences
dominion
and
eternal
destruction
of
lucifer
the
enemy
of
man
and
of
god
hence
on
this
ground
and
because
of
the
terrible
effects
which
would
have
resulted
to
humanity
from
the
proposed
plan
to
deprive
man
of
his
free
agency
and
in
seeking
to
do
away
with
the
atonement
lucifer
was
cast
out
of
heaven
as
were
also
those
associated
with
him
in
the
same
diabolical
plans
and
purposes
the
testimony
of
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
is
in
full
accord
with
the
revelations
in
the
ancient
scriptures
in
it
we
are
instructed
that
god
created
man
male
and
female
after
his
own
image
and
in
his
own
likeness
created
he
them
and
pave
unto
them
commandments
that
they
should
love
and
serve
him
the
only
living
and
true
god
and
that
he
should
be
the
only
being
whom
they
should
worship
but
by
the
transgression
of
these
holy
laws
man
became
sensual
and
devilish
and
became
fallen
man
wherefore
the
almighty
god
gave
his
only
begotten
son
as
it
is
written
in
those
scriptures
which
have
been
given
of
him
he
suffered
temptations
but
gave
no
heed
unto
them
he
was
crucified
died
and
rose
again
the
third
day
and
ascended
into
heaven
to
sit
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
father
to
reign
with
almighty
power
according
to
the
will
of
the
doc
and
sec
xx
again
we
read
from
the
same
source
behold
i
gave
unto
him
that
he
should
be
an
agent
unto
himself
and
i
gave
unto
him
commandment
but
no
temporal
commandment
gave
i
unto
him
for
my
commandments
are
spiritual
they
are
not
natural
nor
temporal
neither
carnal
nor
doc
and
sec
xxix
wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
the
devil
tempted
adam
and
he
partook
the
forbidden
fruit
and
transgressed
the
commandment
wherein
he
became
subject
to
the
will
of
the
because
he
yielded
unto
temptation
wherefore
i
the
lord
god
caused
that
he
should
be
cast
out
from
the
garden
of
eden
from
my
presence
because
of
his
transgression
wherein
he
became
spiritually
dead
which
is
the
first
death
even
that
same
death
which
is
the
last
death
which
is
spiritual
which
shall
be
pronounced
upon
the
wicked
when
i
shall
say
depart
ye
cursed
but
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
i
the
lord
god
gave
unto
adam
and
to
his
seed
that
they
should
not
die
as
to
the
temporal
death
until
i
the
lord
god
should
send
forth
angels
to
declare
unto
them
repentance
and
redemption
through
faith
on
the
name
of
mine
only
begotten
son
and
thus
did
i
the
lord
god
appoint
unto
man
the
days
of
his
probation
that
by
his
natural
death
he
might
be
raised
in
immortality
unto
eternal
life
even
as
many
as
would
doc
and
xxix
in
accordance
with
this
we
find
it
written
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
that
the
lord
did
send
an
angel
to
adam
as
elsewhere
quoted
who
taught
unto
him
the
gospel
thus
it
would
appear
that
if
any
of
the
links
of
this
great
chain
had
been
broken
it
would
have
interfered
with
the
comprehensive
plan
of
the
almighty
pertaining
to
the
salvation
and
eternal
exaltation
of
those
spirits
who
were
his
sons
and
for
whom
principally
the
world
was
made
that
they
through
submission
to
the
requirements
of
the
eternal
principle
and
law
governing
these
matters
might
possess
bodies
and
these
bodies
united
with
the
spirits
might
become
living
souls
and
being
the
sons
of
god
and
made
in
the
image
of
god
they
through
the
atonement
might
be
exalted
by
obedience
to
the
law
of
the
gospel
to
the
godhead
chapter
xviii
christ
as
the
son
of
god
a
comparison
between
his
position
glory
and
those
of
other
sons
of
god
his
recognition
by
the
father
christ
called
the
very
eternal
father
it
may
here
be
asked
what
difference
is
there
between
the
son
of
god
as
the
son
of
god
the
redeemer
and
those
who
believe
in
him
and
partake
of
the
blessings
of
the
gospel
one
thing
as
we
read
is
that
the
father
gave
him
power
to
have
life
in
himself
for
as
the
father
hath
life
in
himself
so
hath
he
given
to
the
son
to
have
life
in
himself
and
further
he
had
power
when
all
mankind
had
lost
their
life
to
restore
life
to
them
again
and
hence
he
is
the
resurrection
and
the
life
which
power
no
other
man
possesses
another
distinction
is
that
having
this
life
in
himself
he
had
power
as
he
said
to
lay
down
his
life
and
to
take
it
up
again
which
power
was
also
given
him
by
the
father
this
is
also
a
power
which
no
other
being
associated
with
this
earth
possesses
again
he
is
the
brightness
of
his
father
glory
and
the
express
image
of
his
person
also
he
doeth
what
he
seeth
the
father
do
while
we
only
do
that
which
we
are
permitted
and
empowered
to
do
by
him
he
is
the
elect
the
chosen
and
one
of
the
presidency
in
the
heavens
and
in
him
dwells
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
bodily
which
could
not
be
said
of
us
in
any
of
these
particulars
another
thing
is
that
all
power
is
given
to
him
in
heaven
and
upon
earth
which
no
earthly
being
could
say
it
is
also
stated
that
lucifer
was
before
adam
so
was
jesus
and
adam
as
well
as
all
other
believers
was
commanded
to
do
all
that
he
did
in
the
name
of
the
son
and
to
call
upon
god
in
his
name
for
ever
more
which
honor
was
not
applicable
to
any
earthly
being
he
in
the
nearness
of
his
relationship
to
the
father
seems
to
occupy
a
position
that
no
other
person
occupies
he
is
spoken
of
as
his
well
beloved
son
as
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
does
not
this
mean
the
only
begotten
after
the
flesh
if
he
was
the
first
born
and
obedient
to
the
laws
of
his
father
did
he
not
inherit
the
position
by
right
to
be
the
representative
of
god
the
savior
and
redeemer
of
the
world
and
was
it
not
his
peculiar
right
and
privilege
as
the
firstborn
the
legitimate
heir
of
god
the
eternal
father
to
step
forth
accomplish
and
carry
out
the
designs
of
his
heavenly
father
pertaining
to
the
redemption
salvation
and
exaltation
of
man
and
being
himself
without
sin
which
no
other
mortal
was
he
took
the
position
of
savior
and
redeemer
which
by
right
belonged
to
him
as
the
first
born
and
does
it
not
seem
that
in
having
a
body
specially
prepared
and
being
the
offspring
of
god
both
in
body
and
spirit
he
stood
preeminently
in
the
position
of
the
son
of
god
or
in
the
place
of
god
and
was
god
and
was
thus
the
fit
and
only
personage
capable
of
making
an
infinite
atonement
hence
we
read
wherefore
when
he
cometh
into
the
world
he
saith
sacrifice
and
offering
thou
wouldst
not
but
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
me
in
burnt
offerings
and
sacrifices
for
sin
thou
hast
had
no
pleasure
then
said
i
lo
i
come
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me
to
do
thy
will
o
god
above
when
he
said
sacrifice
and
offering
and
and
offering
for
sin
thou
wouldst
not
neither
hadst
pleasure
therein
which
are
offered
by
the
law
then
said
he
lo
i
come
to
do
thy
will
o
god
he
taketh
away
the
first
that
he
may
establish
the
second
x
we
are
told
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
that
when
satan
proposed
a
plan
of
his
own
promising
to
redeem
every
soul
of
man
but
wherein
the
free
agency
of
man
would
be
destroyed
and
said
wherefore
give
me
thine
honor
the
only
begotten
said
father
thy
will
be
done
and
the
glory
be
thine
for
ever
i
am
prepared
to
carry
out
thy
plan
the
apostle
above
quoted
states
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
me
then
said
i
lo
i
come
to
do
thy
will
o
lord
hence
from
the
above
we
learn
that
though
others
might
be
the
sons
of
god
through
him
yet
it
needed
his
body
his
fulfilment
of
the
law
the
sacrifice
or
offering
up
of
that
body
in
the
atonement
before
any
of
these
others
who
were
also
sons
of
god
by
birth
in
the
spirit
world
could
attain
to
the
position
of
sons
of
god
as
he
was
and
that
only
through
his
mediation
and
atonement
so
that
in
him
and
of
him
and
through
him
through
the
principle
of
adoption
could
we
alone
obtain
that
position
which
is
spoken
of
by
john
beloved
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
thus
his
atonement
made
it
possible
for
us
to
obtain
an
exaltation
which
we
could
not
have
possessed
without
it
his
name
shall
be
called
immanuel
which
being
interpreted
is
god
with
us
hence
he
is
not
only
called
the
son
of
god
the
first
begotten
of
the
father
the
well
beloved
the
head
and
ruler
and
dictator
of
all
things
jehovah
the
i
am
the
alpha
and
omega
but
he
is
also
called
the
very
eternal
father
does
not
this
mean
that
in
him
were
the
attributes
and
power
of
the
very
eternal
father
for
the
angel
to
adam
said
that
all
things
should
be
done
in
his
name
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
heavens
when
jesus
was
baptized
by
john
the
baptist
saying
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
and
when
the
father
and
the
son
appeared
together
to
the
prophet
joseph
smith
they
were
exactly
alike
in
form
in
appearance
in
glory
and
the
father
said
pointing
to
his
son
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
him
there
the
father
had
his
apparent
tabernacle
and
the
son
had
his
apparent
tabernacle
but
the
son
was
the
agency
through
which
the
father
would
communicate
to
man
as
it
is
elsewhere
said
wherefore
thou
shalt
do
all
that
thou
doest
in
the
name
of
the
son
and
thou
shalt
repent
and
shalt
call
upon
god
in
the
name
of
the
son
for
evermore

in

image
of

of

he
stands
erect

in

beautifully
constructed

standing
not

by

but
by
adaptability
beauty
symmetry
and
glory
at
the
head
of
all
creation
possessing
also
mental
powers
and
the
capacity
of
reflecting
upon
the
past
with
capabilities
to
reason
upon
cause
and
effect
and
by
the
inductive
powers
of
his
mind
through
the
inspiration
of
the
almighty
to
comprehend
the
magnificent
laws
of
nature
as
exhibited
in
the
works
of
creation
with
the
capacity
also
of
using
the
elements
and
forces
of
nature
and
of
adapting
them
to
his
own
special
benefit
and
by
his
powers
penetrating
into
the
deep
ascending
into
the
heavens
rushing
with
mighty
velocity
across
the
earth
making
use
of
the
separate
or
combined
forces
of
nature
with
which
he
is
surrounded
and
subjugating
them
to
his
will
as
likewise
by
his
intelligence
he
has
dominion
over
the
fishes
of
the
sea
over
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
he
can
girdle
the
earth
with
the
electric
fluid
and
convey
his
thoughts
to
any
land
or
zone
by
the
same
subtle
influence
he
can
talk
with
his
fellows
and
be
heard
when
hundreds
of
miles
apart
he
can
apply
the
forces
of
earth
air
fire
and
water
to
make
them
subservient
to
his
will
and
stands
proudly
erect
as
the
head
of
all
creation
and
the
representative
of
god
upon
the
earth
but
while
he
occupies
this
exalted
position
and
is
in
the
image
of
god
yet
he
possesses
simply
as
a
man
only
the
powers
which
belong
to
man
and
is
subject
to
weakness
infirmity
disease
and
death
and
when
he
dies
without
some
superior
aid
pertaining
to
the
future
that
noble
structure
lies
silent
and
helpless
its
organs
that
heretofore
were
active
lively
and
energetic
are
now
dormant
inactive
and
powerless
and
what
of
the
mind
that
before
went
back
into
eternity
and
reached
forward
into
eternity
and
what
of
its
powers
or
what
of
that
spirit
which
with
its
godlike
energies
its
prescience
and
power
could
grasp
infinity
what
of
it
and
where
is
it
the
scriptures
say
that
the
body
returns
to
the
dust
and
the
spirit
returns
to
god
who
gave
it
but
what
of
its
powers
as
made
known
to
us
what
of
the
hereafter
the
philosophy
of
the
world
tells
us
that
the
spirit
dies
with
the
body
and
like
it
is
dissipated
in
surrounding
nature
but
as
an
entirety
no
longer
exists
and
all
the
power
the
being
ever
had
was
to
propagate
its
own
species
and
to
impart
the
powers
of
the
body
and
the
mind
to
its
posterity
such
philosophers
can
comprehend
nothing
pertaining
to
the
future
no
glory
no
exaltation
no
eternal
progression
only
as
developed
by
a
succession
of
manhood
if
then
there
is
a
spirit
in
man
which
reaches
into
futurity
that
would
grasp
eternal
progress
eternal
enjoyments
and
eternal
exaltations
then
those
glories
those
exaltations
those
capabilities
and
those
powers
must
be
the
gift
of
some
superior
being
power
or
authority
to
that
which
exists
in
man
for
the
foregoing
is
a
brief
exhibition
of
the
powers
and
capabilities
of
humanity
it
is
of
this
gift
that
we
now
speak
it
is
of
a
principle
that
emanates
from
god
that
originates
with
a
superior
intelligence
whose
plans
and
powers
and
capabilities
are
exalted
above
those
of
mortal
man
as
the
heavens
are
above
the
earth
or
as
the
majestic
works
of
the
great
creator
throughout
the
infinitude
of
space
are
superior
to
the
puny
efforts
of
the
children
of
mortality
it
is
for
the
exaltation
of
man
to
this
state
of
superior
intelligence
and
godhead
that
the
mediation
and
atonement
of
jesus
christ
is
instituted
and
that
noble
being
man
made
in
the
image
of
god
is
rendered
capable
not
only
of
being
a
son
of
man
but
also
a
son
of
god
through
adoption
and
is
rendered
capable
of
becoming
a
god
possessing
the
power
the
majesty
the
exaltation
and
the
position
of
a
god
as
it
is
written
beloved
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
as
a
man
through
the
powers
of
his
body
he
could
attain
to
the
dignity
and
completeness
of
manhood
but
could
go
no
further
as
a
man
he
is
born
as
a
man
he
lives
and
as
a
man
he
dies
but
through
the
essence
and
power
of
the
godhead
which
is
in
him
which
descended
to
him
as
the
gift
of
god
from
his
heavenly
father
he
is
capable
of
rising
from
the
contracted
limits
of
manhood
to
the
dignity
of
a
god
and
thus
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
and
the
adoption
he
is
capable
of
eternal
exaltation
eternal
lives
and
eternal
progression
but
this
transition
from
his
manhood
to
the
godhead
can
alone
be
made
through
a
power
which
is
superior
to
man
an
infinite
power
an
eternal
power
even
the
power
of
the
godhead
for
as
in
adam
all
die
so
in
christ
can
all
be
made
alive
through
him
mankind
are
brought
into
communion
and
communication
with
god
through
his
atonement
they
are
enabled
as
he
was
to
vanquish
death
through
that
atonement
and
the
power
of
the
priesthood
associated
therewith
they
become
heirs
of
god
and

christ
to
be
subject
to

all
things

had
there
been
no

the
sons
of

inability
to
save

christ
glory
before
the

was
necessity
for
an
infinite
atonement
the
father
and
son
have
life
in
themselves
again
we
will
return
to
the
quotation
from
the
book
of
mormon
a
satan
as
we
have
remarked
before
wanted
to
deprive
man
of
his
agency
for
if
man
had
his
agency
it
would
seem
that
necessarily
the
lord
would
be
subject
to
him
as
is
stated
for
it
behooveth
the
great
creator
that
he
suffereth
himself
to
become
subject
unto
man
in
the
flesh
and
die
for
all
men
that
all
men
might
become
subject
unto
him
footnote
a
nephi
ix
the
lord
being
thus
subjected
to
man
he
would
be
placed
in
the
lowest
position
to
which
it
was
possible
for
him
to
descend
because
of
the
weakness
the
corruption
and
the
fallibility
of
human
nature
but
if
man
had
his
free
agency
this
necessarily
would
be
the
result
and
hence
as
it
is
said
jesus
descended
below
all
things
that
he
might
be
raised
above
all
things
and
hence
also
while
satan
calculation
was
to
deprive
man
of
his
free
agency
and
to
prevent
himself
or
the
only
begotten
from
being
subject
to
this
humiliation
and
infamy
the
lord
plan
was
to
give
man
his
free
agency
provide
a
redeemer
and
suffer
that
redeemer
to
endure
all
the
results
incidental
to
such
a
position
and
thus
by
offering
himself
as
a
substitute
and
conquering
death
hell
and
the
grave
he
would
ultimately
subjugate
all
things
unto
himself
and
at
the
same
time
make
it
possible
for
man
to
obtain
an
exaltation
that
he
never
could
have
had
without
his
agency
it
is
said
as
already
stated
for
behold
if
the
flesh
should
rise
no
more
our
spirits
must
become
subject
to
that
angel
who
fell
from
before
the
presence
of
the
eternal
god
and
became
the
devil
to
rise
no
more
and
hence
the
plan
of
satan
it
appears
would
have
frustrated
the
designs
of
the
almighty
and
have
deprived
man
of
that
exaltation
and
glory
which
his
heavenly
father
contemplated
it
is
further
written
and
our
spirits
must
have
become
like
unto
him
and
we
become
devils
angels
to
a
devil
to
be
shut
out
from
the
presence
of
our
god
and
to
remain
with
the
father
of
lies
in
misery
like
unto
himself
yea
to
that
being
who
beguiled
our
first
parents
who
transformeth
himself
nigh
unto
an
angel
of
light
and
stirreth
up
the
children
of
men
unto
secret
combinations
of
murder
and
all
manner
of
secret
works
of
darkness
o
how
great
the
goodness
of
our
god
who
prepareth
a
way
for
our
escape
from
the
grasp
of
this
awful
monster
yea
that
monster
death
and
hell
which
i
call
the
death
of
the
body
and
also
the
death
of
the
spirit
and
because
of
the
way
of
deliverance
of
our
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
this
death
of
which
i
have
spoken
which
is
the
temporal
shall
deliver
up
its
dead
which
death
is
the
grave
and
this
death
of
which
i
have
spoken
which
is
the
spiritual
death
shall
deliver
up
its
dead
which
spiritual
death
is
hell
wherefore
death
and
hell
must
deliver
up
their
dead
and
hell
must
deliver
up
its
captive
spirits
and
the
grave
must
deliver
up
its
captive
bodies
and
the
bodies
and
the
spirits
of
men
will
be
restored
one
to
the
other
and
it
is
by
the
power
of
the
resurrection
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
o
how
great
the
plan
of
our
god
for
on
the
other
hand
the
paradise
of
god
must
deliver
up
the
spirits
of
the
righteous
and
the
grave
deliver
up
the
body
of
the
righteous
and
the
spirit
and
the
body
is
restored
to
itself
again
and
all
men
become
incorruptible
and
immortal
and
they
are
living
souls
having
a
perfect
knowledge
like
unto
us
in
the
flesh
save
it
be
that
our
knowledge
shall
be
perfect
wherefore
we
shall
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
our
guilt
and
our
uncleanness
and
our
nakedness
and
the
righteous
shall
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
their
enjoyment
and
their
righteousness
being
clothed
with
purity
yea
even
with
the
robe
of
righteousness
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
all
men
shall
have
passed
from
this
first
death
unto
life
insomuch
as
they
have
become
immortal
they
must
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
and
then
cometh
the
judgment
and
then
must
they
be
judged
according
to
the
holy
judgment
of
god
and
assuredly
as
the
lord
liveth
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
it
and
it
is
his
eternal
word
which
can
not
pass
away
that
they
who
are
righteous
shall
be
righteous
still
and
they
who
are
filthy
shall
be
filthy
still
wherefore
they
who
are
filthy
are
the
devil
and
his
angels
and
they
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
them
and
their
torment
is
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
whose
flame
ascendeth
up
for
ever
and
ever
and
has
no
end
o
the
greatness
and
the
justice
of
our
god
for
he
executeth
all
his
words
and
they
have
gone
forth
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
law
must
be
fulfilled
nephi
ix
in
the
economy
of
god
pertaining
to
the
salvation
of
the
human
family
we
are
told
in
the
scriptures
that
it
was
necessary
that
christ
should
descend
below
all
things
that
he
might
be
raised
above
all
things
as
stated
above
he
had
to
become
subject
to
man
in
the
flesh
it
was
further
necessary
that
he
should
descend
below
all
things
in
order
that
he
might
raise
others
above
all
things
for
if
he
could
not
raise
himself
and
be
exalted
through
those
principles
brought
about
by
the
atonement
he
could
not
raise
others
he
could
not
do
for
others
what
he
could
not
do
for
himself
and
hence
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
descend
below
all
things
that
he
might
be
raised
above
all
things
and
it
was
necessary
that
those
whom
he
proposed
to
save
should
also
descend
below
all
things
that
by
and
through
the
same
power
that
he
obtained
his
exaltation
they
also
through
his
atonement
expiation
and
intercession
might
be
raised
to
the
same
power
with
him
and
as
he
was
the
son
of
god
that
they
might
also
be
the
adopted
sons
of
god
hence
john
says
beloved
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
john
iii
and
by
this
power
we
shall
overcome
and
sit
down
on
his
throne
as
jesus
overcame
and
sat
down
upon
the
throne
of
his
father
we
are
told
in
the
foregoing
quotation
from
the
book
of
mormon
that
the
atonement
must
needs
be
infinite
why
did
it
need
an
infinite
atonement
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
stream
can
never
rise
higher
than
its
fountain
and
man
having
assumed
a
fleshly
body
and
become
of
the
earth
earthy
and
through
the
violation
of
a
law
having
cut
himself
off
from
his
association
with
his
father
and
become
subject
to
death
in
this
condition
as
the
mortal
life
of
man
was
short
and
in
and
of
himself
he
could
have
no
hope
of
benefitting
himself
or
redeeming
himself
from
his
fallen
condition
or
of
bringing
himself
back
to
the
presence
of
his
father
some
superior
agency
was
needed
to
elevate
him
above
his
low
and
degraded
position
this
superior
agency
was
the
son
of
god
who
had
not
as
man
had
violated
a
law
of
his
father
but
was
yet
one
with
his
father
possessing
his
glory
his
power
his
authority
his
dominion
as
he
himself
prayed
and
now
o
father
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
thee
before
the
world
was
john
xvii
a
man
as
a
man
could
arrive
at
all
the
dignity
that
a
man
was
capable
of
obtaining
or
receiving
but
it
needed
a
god
to
raise
him
to
the
dignity
of
a
god
for
this
cause
it
is
written
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
and
how
and
why
like
him
because
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
atonement
and
the
adoption
it
is
made
possible
for
us
to
become
of
the
family
of
god
and
joint
heirs
with
jesus
christ
and
that
as
he
the
potential
instrument
through
the
oneness
that
existed
between
him
and
his
father
by
reason
of
obedience
to
divine
law
overcame
death
hell
and
the
grave
and
sat
down
upon
his
father
throne
so
shall
we
be
able
to
sit
down
with
him
even
upon
his
throne
thus
as
it
is
taught
in
the
book
of
mormon
it
must
needs
be
that
there
be
an
infinite
atonement
and
hence
of
him
and
by
him
and
through
him
are
all
things
and
through
him
do
we
obtain
every
blessing
power
right
immunity
salvation
and
exaltation
he
is
our
god
our
redeemer
our
savior
to
whom
with
the
father
and
the
holy
spirit
be
eternal
and
everlasting
praises
worlds
without
end
again
jesus
testifies
of
himself
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
the
hour
is
coming
and
now
is
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
god
and
they
that
hear
shall
live
for
as
the
father
hath
life
in
himself
so
hath
he
given
to
the
son
to
have
life
in
himself
and
hath
given
him
authority
to
execute
judgment
also
because
he
is
the
son
of
man
marvel
not
at
this
for
the
hour
is
coming
in
the
which
all
that
are
in
the
graves
shall
hear
his
voice
and
shall
come
forth
they
that
have
done
good
unto
the
resurrection
of
life
and
they
that
have
done
evil
unto
the
resurrection
of
damnation
john
v
it
would
seem
from
the
above
that
the
son
hath
life
inherent
in
himself
even
as
the
father
hath
life
in
himself
he
having
received
this
power
from
the
father
also
that
he
had
power
in
himself
as
elsewhere
stated
to
lay
down
this
body
and
also
to
take
it
up
again
and
in
this
respect
he
differed
from
others
while
man
dies
and
lays
down
his
body
he
has
not
power
under
any
circumstance
to
raise
it
again
only
through
the
power
of
jesus
and
his
intercession
and
atonement
for
the
redeemer
has
proclaimed
himself
to
be
the
resurrection
and
the
life
and
it
is
by
this
resurrective
power
which
he
possesses
as
the
gift
of
god
through
obedience
to
the
will
of
the
father
that
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
god
and
shall
live
hence
he
not
only
becomes
the
first
fruits
of
those
that
slept
having
conquered
death
himself
and
triumphed
over
it
but
he
also
becomes
the
means
of
the
resurrection
of
all
men
from
the
dead
hence
he
says
therefore
doth
my
father
love
me
because
i
lay
down
my
life
that
i
might
take
it
again
no
man
taketh
it
from
me
but
i
lay
it
down
of
myself
i
have
power
to
lay
it
down
and
i
have
power
to
take
it
again
this
commandment
have
i
received
of
my
father
john
x
thus
when
he
says
he
has
power
to
lay
down
his
life
and
power
to
take
it
up
again
he
speaks
of
a
power
never
before
exhibited
among
men
upon
this
earth
and
which
power
indeed
does
not
belong
to
man
in
and
of
himself
chapter

the
relation
of
the
atonement
to
little
children
jesus
assumes
the
responsibility
of
man

and
bears
the
weight
of
his
sins
and
sufferings
the
inferior
creatures
and
sacrifice
the
terrors
and
agonies
of
christ
passion
and
death
the
tribulations
earthquakes
when
he
gave
up

universal
nature
trembles
the

zenos
and
enoch
the
testimony
of
the
centurion
heirship
and
the
descent
of
blessings
and
curses
the
redeemer
himself
when
tabernacling
in
the
flesh
said
to
his
disciples
on
the
eastern
continent
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
god
verily
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
not
receive
the
kingdom
of
god
as
a
little
child
shall
in
no
wise
enter
therein
luke
xviii
and
after
his
crucifixion
and
resurrection
he
repeated
this
same
admonition
to
his
nephite
disciples
and
again
i
say
unto
you
ye
must
repent
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
and
become
as
a
little
child
or
ye
can
in
no
wise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
nephi
xi
without
adam
transgression
those
children
could
not
have
existed
through
the
atonement
they
are
placed
in
a
state
of
salvation
without
any
act
of
their
own
these
would
embrace
according
to
the
opinion
of
statisticians
more
than
of
the
human
family
who
can
attribute
their
salvation
only
to
the
mediation
and
atonement
of
the
savior
thus
as
stated
elsewhere
in
some
mysterious
incomprehensible
way
jesus
assumed
the
responsibility
which
naturally
would
have
devolved
upon
adam
but
which
could
only
be
accomplished
through
the
mediation
of
himself
and
by
taking
upon
himself
their
sorrows
assuming
their
responsibilities
and
bearing
their
transgressions
or
sins
in
a
manner
to
us
incomprehensible
and
inexplicable
he
bore
the
weight
of
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
not
only
of
adam
but
of
his
posterity
and
in
doing
that
opened
the
kingdom
of
heaven
not
only
to
all
believers
and
all
who
obeyed
the
law
of
god
but
to
more
than
of
the
human
family
who
die
before
they
come
to
years
of
maturity
as
well
as
to
the
heathen
who
having
died
without
law
will
through
his
mediation
be
resurrected
without
law
and
be
judged
without
law
and
thus
participate
according
to
their
capacity
works
and
worth
in
the
blessings
of
his
atonement
again
there
is
another
phase
of
this
subject
that
must
not
be
forgotten
from
the
commencement
of
the
offering
of
sacrifices
the
inferior
creature
had
to
suffer
for
the
superior
although
it
had
taken
no
part
in
the
act
of
disobedience
yet
was
its
blood
shed
and
its
life
sacrificed
thus
prefiguring
the
atonement
of
the
son
of
god
which
should
eventually
take
place
the
creature
indeed
was
made
subject
to
vanity
not
willingly
but
by
reason
of
him
who
hath
subjected
the
same
in
hope
millions
of
such
offerings
were
made
and
hecatombs
of
these
expiatory
sacrifices
were
offered
in
view
of
the
great
event
that
would
be
consummated
when
jesus
should
offer
up
himself
with
man
this
was
simply
the
obedience
to
a
command
and
a
given
law
and
with
him
might
be
considered
simply
a
pecuniary
sacrifice
with
the
animals
it
was
a
sacrifice
of
life
but
what
is
the
reason
for
all
this
suffering
and
bloodshed
and
sacrifice
we
are
told
that
without
shedding
of
blood
is
no
remission
of
sins
this
is
beyond
our
comprehension
jesus
had
to
take
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
the
just
for
the
unjust
but
previous
to
this
grand
sacrifice
these
animals
had
to
have
their
blood
shed
as
types
until
the
great
antitype
should
offer
up
himself
once
for
all
and
as
he
in
his
own
person
bore
the
sins
of
all
and
atoned
for
them
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
so
there
came
upon
him
the
weight
and
agony
of
ages
and
generations
the
indescribable
agony
consequent
upon
this
great
sacrificial
atonement
wherein
he
bore
the
sins
of
the
world
and
suffered
in
his
own
person
the
consequences
of
an
eternal
law
of
god
broken
by
man
hence
his
profound
grief
his
indescribable
anguish
his
overpowering
torture
all
experienced
in
the
submission
to
the
eternal
fiat
of
jehovah
and
the
requirements
of
an
inexorable
law
the
suffering
of
the
son
of
god
was
not
simply
the
suffering
of
personal
death
for
in
assuming
the
position
that
he
did
in
making
an
atonement
for
the
sins
of
the
world
he
bore
the
weight
the
responsibility
and
the
burden
of
the
sins
of
all
men
which
to
us
is
incomprehensible
as
stated
the
lord
your
redeemer
suffered
death
in
the
flesh
wherefore
he
suffereth
the
pains
of
all
men
and
isaiah
says
surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
also
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
again
he
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
and
he
bare
the
sins
of
many
or
as
it
is
written
in
the
second
book
of
nephi
for
behold
he
suffereth
the
pains
of
all
men
yea
the
pains
of
every
living
creature
both
men
women
and
children
who
belong
to
the
family
of
adam
whilst
in
mosiah
it
is
declared
he
shall
suffer
temptations
and
pain
of
body
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
even
more
than
man
can
suffer
except
it
be
unto
death
for
behold
blood
cometh
from
every
pore
so
great
shall
be
his
anguish
for
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
his
people
groaning
beneath
this
concentrated
load
this
intense
incomprehensible
pressure
this
terrible
exaction
of
divine
justice
from
which
feeble
humanity
shrank
and
through
the
agony
thus
experienced
sweating
great
drops
of
blood
he
was
led
to
exclaim
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
he
had
wrestled
with
the
superincumbent
load
in
the
wilderness
he
had
struggled
against
the
powers
of
darkness
that
had
been
let
loose
upon
him
there
placed
below
all
things
his
mind
surcharged
with
agony
and
pain
lonely
and
apparently
helpless
and
forsaken
in
his
agony
the
blood
oozed
from
his
pores
thus
rejected
by
his
own
attacked
by
the
powers
of
darkness
and
seemingly
forsaken
by
his
god
on
the
cross
he
bowed
beneath
the
accumulated
load
and
cried
out
in
anguish
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
when
death
approached
to
relieve
him
from
his
horrible
position
a
ray
of
hope
appeared
through
the
abyss
of
darkness
with
which
he
had
been
surrounded
and
in
a
spasm
of
relief
seeing
the
bright
future
beyond
he
said
it
is
finished
father
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit
as
a
god
he
descended
below
all
things
and
made
himself
subject
to
man
in
man
fallen
condition
as
a
man
he
grappled
with
all
the
circumstances
incident
to
his
sufferings
in
the
world
anointed
indeed
with
the
oil
of
gladness
above
his
fellows
he
struggled
with
and
overcame
the
powers
of
men
and
devils
of
earth
and
hell
combined
and
aided
by
this
superior
power
of
the
godhead
he
vanquished
death
hell
and
the
grave
and
arose
triumphant
as
the
son
of
god
the
very
eternal
father
the
messiah
the
prince
of
peace
the
redeemer
the
savior
of
the
world
having
finished
and
completed
the
work
pertaining
to
the
atonement
which
his
father
had
given
him
to
do
as
the
son
of
god
and
the
son
of
man
as
the
son
of
man
he
endured
all
that
it
was
possible
for
flesh
and
blood
to
endure
as
the
son
of
god
he
triumphed
over
all
and
forever
ascended
to
the
right
hand
of
god
to
further
carry
out
the
designs
of
jehovah
pertaining
to
the
world
and
to
the
human
family
and
again
not
only
did
his
agony
affect
the
mind
and
body
of
jesus
causing
him
to
sweat
great
drops
of
blood
but
by
reason
of
some
principle
to
us
unfathomable
his
suffering
affected
universal
nature
world
upon
world
eternal
things
hang
on
thy
anguish
king
of
kings
when
he
gave
up
the
ghost
the
solid
rocks
were
riven
the
foundations
of
the
earth
trembled
earthquakes
shook
the
continents
and
rent
the
isles
of
the
deep
darkness
overspread
the
sky
the
mighty
waters
overflowed
their
accustomed
bounds
huge
mountains
sank
and
valleys
rose
the
handiwork
of
feeble
men
was
overthrown
their
cities
were
engulphed
or
consumed
by
the
vivid
shafts
of
lightning
and
all
material
things
were
convulsed
with
the
throes
of
seeming
dissolution
thus
was
brought
to
pass
that
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophet
zenos
the
rocks
of
the
earth
must
rend
and
because
of
the
groanings
of
the
earth
many
of
the
kings
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
shall
be
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
exclaim
the
god
of
nature
suffers
nephi
xix
and
it
is
recorded
that
so
confessed
the
centurion
and
they
that
were
with
him
watching
the
body
of
jesus
for
when
they
witnessed
the
earthquake
and
the
other
things
that
were
done
they
feared
greatly
saying
truly
this
was
the
son
of
god
so
also
was
fulfilled
that
which
is
written
in
the
prophecy
of
enoch
and
the
lord
said
unto
enoch
look
and
he
looked
and
beheld
the
son
of
man
lifted
up
on
the
cross
after
the
manner
of
men
and
he
heard
a
loud
voice
and
the
heavens
were
veiled
and
all
the
creations
of
god
mourned
and
the
earth
groaned
and
the
rocks
were
rent
and
the
saints
arose
and
were
crowned
at
the
right
hand
of
the
son
of
man
with
crowns
of
glory
and
as
many
of
the
spirits
as
were
in
prison
came
forth
and
stood
on
the
right
hand
of
god
and
the
remainder
were
reserved
in
chains
of
darkness
until
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
pearl
of
great
price
thus
such
was
the
torturing
pressure
of
this
intense
this
indescribable
agony
that
it
burst
forth
abroad
beyond
the
confines
of
his
body
convulsed
all
nature
and
spread
throughout
all
space
the
statement
previously
quoted
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
could
only
be
in
reference
to
the
transgression
of
our
first
parent
who
acting
as
the
progenitor
and
head
of
the
human
family
assumed
a
responsibility
not
only
for
himself
but
for
all
of
his
seed
for
the
whole
of
the
human
family
not
having
then
been
born
could
not
be
responsible
personally
for
acts
that
transpired
before
they
had
an
existence
on
the
earth
but
as
children
inherit
blessings
from
their
fathers
so
it
would
also
seem
that
they
must
inherit
curses
or
share
in
their
calamities
the
lord
in
speaking
to
the
children
of
israel
said
he
would
visit
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
him
and
furthermore
a
bastard
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
the
lord
even
to
his
tenth
generation
this
ostracism
or
punishment
could
be
for
no
personal
act
of
their
own
for
they
had
no
part
in
the
sin
of
their
parents
any
more
than
progeny
had
in
the
original
sin
or
transgression
but
it
seems
to
be
a
principle
admitted
that
if
they
share
the
blessings
accruing
to
their
father
for
righteous
acts
they
must
also
share
the
condemnation
for
acts
that
are
unrighteous
hence
comes
in
the
atonement
of
the
messiah
which
amply
covers
all
of
these
acts
and
more
than
that
for
as
paul
says
but
not
as
the
offence
so
also
is
the
free
gift
for
if
through
the
offence
of
one
many
be
dead
much
more
the
grace
of
god
and
the
gift
by
grace
winch
is
by
one
man
jesus
christ
hath
abounded
unto
many
hence
we
say
as
above
the
atonement
covered
more
apparently
than
the
transgression
for
adam
without
the
transgression
would
have
had
no
increase
that
transgression
opened
the
way
for
the
increase
as
stated
by
eve
were
it
not
for
our
transgression
we
never
should
have
had
seed
and
never
should
have
known
good
and
evil
and
the
joy
of
our
redemption
and
the
eternal
life
which
god
giveth
unto
all
the
obedient
that
being
the
case
all
children
born
among
any
people
not
having
arrived
at
the
years
of
accountability
are
saved
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
as
stated
by
moroni
little
children
can
not
repent
wherefore
it
is
awful
wickedness
to
deny
the
pure
mercies
of
god
unto
them
for
they
are
all
alive
in
him
because
of
his
mercy
and
he
that
saith
that
little
children
need
baptism
denieth
the
mercies
of
christ
and
setteth
at
naught
the
atonement
of
him
and
the
power
of
his
redemption
wo
unto
such
for
they
are
in
danger
of
death
hell
and
endless
torment
i
speak
it
boldly
god
hath
commanded
me
listen
unto
them
and
give
heed
or
they
stand
against
you
at
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
for
behold
that
all
little
children
are
alive
in
christ
and
also
all
they
that
are
without
the
law
for
the
power
of
redemption
cometh
on
all
they
that
have
no
law
wherefore
he
that
is
not
condemned
or
he
that
is
under
no
condemnation
can
not
repent
and
unto
such
baptism
availeth
nothing
but
it
is
mockery
before
god
denying
the
mercies
of
christ
and
the
power
of
his
holy
spirit
and
putting
trust
in
dead
works

something
peculiarly
interesting
in
the
contemplation
of
events
associated
with
the
future
destiny
of
mankind
among
other
things
it
will
be
seen
that
there
is
a
very
close
connection
or
affinity
between
the
operations
of
the
priesthood
in
the
heavens
and
the
priesthood
upon
earth
in
examining
this
subject
we
find
it
written
the
lord
redeemeth
none
such
that
rebel
against
him
and
die
in
their
sins
yea
even
all
those
that
have
perished
in
their
sins
ever
since
the
world
began
that
have
wilfully
rebelled
against
god
that
have
known
the
commandments
of
god
and
would
not
keep
them
these
are
they
that
have
no
part
in
the
first
resurrection

but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
promised
that
those
who
would
have
received
the
gospel
if
they
had
had
the
opportunity
shall
yet
have
that
privilege
the
prophet
joseph
smith
records
in
his
history
thus
came
the
voice
of
the
lord
unto
me
saying
all
those
who
have
died
without
a
knowledge
of
this
gospel
who
would
have
received
it
if
they

no
with
this
agree
the
words
of
the
apostle
paul
that
those
who
have
died
without
law
shall
be
judged
without
law
whilst
the
lord
further
reveals
to
the
prophet
joseph
that
that
which
is
governed
by
law
is
also
preserved
by
law
and
perfected
and
sanctified
by
the
same
that
which
breaketh
a
law
and
abideth
not
by
law
but
seeketh
to
become
a
law
unto
itself
and
willeth
to
abide
in
sin
and
altogether
abideth
in
sin
can
not
be
sanctified
by
law
neither
by
mercy
justice
nor
judgment
therefore
they
must
remain
filthy
still
with
this
teaching
is
associated
a
grand
principle
connected
with
the
everlasting
priesthood
which
administers
in
time
and
in
eternity
when
we
reflect
upon
the
statement
of
creatures
being
judged
without
law
the
question
arises
as
to
who
are
to
be
their
judges
we
may
here
state
that
christ
is
called
the
judge
of
the
quick
and
the
dead
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
we
further
read
that
the
twelve
apostles
who
ministered
in
jerusalem
shall
sit
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
xix
also
the
following
and
again
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
and
it
hath
gone
forth
in
a
firm
decree
by
the
will
of
the
father
that
mine
apostles
the
twelve
who
were
with
me
in
my
ministry
at
jerusalem
shall
stand
at
my
right
hand
at
the
day
of
my
coming
in
a
pillar
of
fire
being
clothed
with
robes
of
righteousness
with
crowns
upon
their
heads
in
glory
even
as
i
am
to
judge
the
whole
house
of
israel
even
as
many
as
have
loved
me
and
kept
my
commandments
and
none
doc
and
sec
xxix
and
nephi
writes
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
twelve
disciples
of
the
lamb
who
are
chosen
to
minister
unto
thy
seed
and
he
said
unto
me
thou
rememberest
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
behold
they
are
they
who
shall
judge
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
wherefore
the
twelve
ministers
of
thy
seed
shall
be
judged
of
them
for
ye
are
of
the
house
of
israel
and
these
twelve
ministers
whom
thou
beholdest
shall
judge
thy
seed
and
behold
they
are
righteous
for
ever
for
because
of
their
faith
in
the
lamb
of
god
their
garments
are
made
white
in
his
blood
nephi
xii
this
exhibits
a
principle
of
adjudication
or
judgment
in
the
hands
firstly
of
the
great
high
priest
and
king
jesus
of
nazareth
the
son
of
god
secondly
in
the
hands
of
the
twelve
apostles
on
the
continent
of
asia
bestowed
by
jesus
himself
thirdly
in
the
twelve
disciples
on
this
continent
to
their
peoples
who
it
appears
are
under
the
presidency
of
the
twelve
apostles
who
ministered
at
jerusalem
which
presidency
is
also
exhibited
by
peter
james
and
john
the
acknowledged
presidency
of
the
twelve
apostles
they
holding
this
priesthood
first
on
the
earth
and
then
in
the
heavens
being
the
legitimate
custodians
of
the
keys
of
the
priesthood
came
and
bestowed
it
upon
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
it
is
also
further
stated
that
the
saints
shall
judge
the
world
thus
christ
is
at
the
head
his
apostles
and
disciples
seem
to
take
the
next
prominent
part
then
comes
the
action
of
the
saints
or
other
branches
of
the
priesthood
who
it
is
stated
shall
judge
the
world
this
combined
priesthood
it
would
appear
will
hold
the
destiny
of
the
human
family
in
their
hands
and
adjudicate
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
their
affairs
and
it
would
seem
to
be
quite
reasonable
if
the
twelve
apostles
in
jerusalem
are
to
be
the
judges
of
the
twelve
tribes
and
the
twelve
disciples
on
this
continent
are
to
be
the
judges
of
the
descendants
of
nephi
then
that
the
brother
of
jared
and
jared
should
be
the
judges
of
the
jaredites
their
descendants
and
further
that
the
first
presidency
and
twelve
who
have
officiated
in
our
age
should
operate
in
regard
to
mankind
in
this
dispensation
and
also
in
regard
to
all
matters
connected
with
them
whether
they
relate
to
the
past
present
or
future
as
the
aforementioned
have
done
in
regard
to
their
several
peoples
and
that
the
patriarchs
the
presidents
the
twelve
the
high
priests
the
seventies
the
elders
the
bishops
priests
teachers
and
deacons
should
hold
their
several
places
behind
the
veil
and
officiate
according
to
their
calling
and
standing
in
that
priesthood
in
fact
the
priesthood
is
called
an
everlasting
priesthood
it
ministers
in
time
and
in
eternity
moses
speaks
of
the
levitical
priesthood
as
an
everlasting
priesthood
xl
paul
refers
to
the
melchizedek
priesthood
as
being
without
father
without
mother
without
descent
having
neither
beginning
of
days
nor
end
of
life
vii
whilst
the
prophet
joseph
smith
states
that
this
priesthood
continueth
in
the
church

p
this
being
the
case
it
necessarily
follows
that
those
holding
the
priesthood
on
the
earth
continue
in
the
exercise
of
that
priesthood
in
the
heavens
their
operations
being
changed
from
this
to
another
state
of
existence
and
when
the
dead
small
and
great
shall
be
judged
while
god
stands
at
the
head
and
jesus
is
the
great
high
priest
of
our
profession
all
those
who
have
ever
lived
who
are
worthy
will
stand
in
their
proper
positions
according
to
their
callings
priesthood
ordinations
or
quorums
it
is
written
that
they
without
us
can
not
be
made
perfect
and
that
we
without
them
can
not
be
made
perfect
we
have
commenced
to
build
temples
and
to
administer
in
them
according
to
the
decrees
purposes
and
foreknowledge
of
god
when
we
have
got
through
with
our
personal
affairs
connected
with
our
individual
families
and
interests
so
far
as
we
can
legitimately
trace
them
then
it
becomes
a
question
as
to
the
position
of
those
that
are
behind
the
veil
of
whom
we
have
no
personal
knowledge
does
it
not
seem
consistent
that
to
the
ancient
as
well
as
the
modern
patriarchs
prophets
presidents
apostles
seventies
high
priests
elders
bishops
and
others
would
be
committed
the
manipulation
and
judgment
of
those
who
are
behind
the
veil
and
with
whom
we
at
present
have
nothing
to
do
and
if
temples
are
to
be
built
here
and
ordinances
performed
in
them
in
the
interest
of
those
who
have
died
without
law
and
in
the
adjudication
of
all
these
matters
that
the
priesthood
behind
the
veil
to
whom
is
committed
the
judgment
of
these
things
should
communicate
with
the
priesthood
upon
the
earth
that
they
may
be
administered
for
by
proxy
in
the
temples
erected
by
us
and
those
who
shall
follow
after
us
that
all
things
may
be
done
according
to
equity
law
and
justice
and
that
none
but
those
worthy
to
receive
those
great
blessings
and
high
exaltations
can
participate
in
the
same
being
thus
sanctioned
by
the
priesthood
in
heaven
and
the
priesthood
upon
the
earth
hence
while
they
are
saviors
preach
to
the
spirits
in
prison
and
judge
the
dead
we
build
temples
and
administer
for
them
upon
the
earth
and
thus
become
as
it
is
written
saviors
upon
mount
zion
operating
and
cooperating
with
the
priesthood
behind
the
veil
in
the
interest
happiness
salvation
and
exaltation
of
the
human
family
thus
shall
we
also
become
legitimately
and
by
right
through
the
atonement
and
adoption
kings
and
priests
priests
to
administer
in
the
holy
ordinances
pertaining
to
the
endowments
and
exaltations
and
kings
under
christ
who
is
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
to
rule
and
govern
according
to
the
eternal
laws
of
justice
and
equity
those
who
are
thus
redeemed
and
exalted
in
corroboration
of
these
ideas
is
the
statement
in
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
that
father
joseph
smith
who
was
the
first
patriarch
to
the
church
in
this
dispensation
is
now
at
the
right
hand
of
abraham
who
was
also
a
presiding
patriarch
the
passage
reads
that
i
may
receive
him
unto
myself
even
as
i
did
my
aged
servant
joseph
smith
who
sitteth
with
abraham
at
his
right
hand
and
blessed
and
holy
is
he
for
he
is
doc
and
cxxiv
it
is
also
stated
of
david
patten
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
who
was
slain
by
the
mobbers
in
missouri
that
david
patten
i
have
taken
unto
myself
behold
his
priesthood
no
man
taketh
from
him
but
verily
i
say
unto
you
another
may
be
appointed
unto
the
same
doc
and
cxxiv
the
same
is
said
of
seymour
brunson
one
of
the
high
council
and
of
edward
partridge
the
first
bishop
of
the
church
both
of
whom
were
dead
seymour
brunson
i
have
taken
unto
myself
no
man
taketh
his
priesthood
but
another
may
be
appointed
unto
the
same
priesthood
in
his
doc
and
sec
cxxiv
that
when
he
shall
finish
his
work
that
i
may
receive
him
unto
myself
even
as
i
did
my
servant
david
patten
who
is
with
me
at
this
time
and
also
my
servant
edward
doc
and
sec
cxxiv
we
read
that
moses
and
elias
came
to
administer
to
jesus
on
the
mount
while
peter
james
and
john
were
with
him
who
were
this
moses
and
this
elias
moses
was
a
great
prophet
appointed
by
the
lord
to
deliver
israel
from
egyptian
bondage
and
lead
them
to
the
promised
land
and
he
held
the
keys
of
the
gathering
dispensation
which
keys
he
afterwards
conferred
upon
joseph
smith
in
the
kirtland
temple
who
was
elias
elijah
which
name
in
the
old
scriptures
is
made
synonymous
with
elias
and
who
held
according
to
the
testimony
of
joseph
smith
as
elsewhere
stated
the
keys
of
the
priesthood
these
men
who
held
those
keys
and
officiated
upon
the
earth
having
left
the
earth
now
come
associated
with
jesus
to
administer
to
peter
james
and
john
and
confer
upon
them
the
priesthood
which
they
hold
and
these
three
ancient
apostles
conferred
the
priesthood
upon
joseph
smith
and
oliver
cowdery
in
this
dispensation
this
principle
is
very
clearly
illustrated
in
the
following
quotation
from
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
sec
cxxviii
and
again
what
do
we
hear
glad
tidings
from
cumorah
moroni
an
angel
from
heaven
declaring
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophets
the
book
to
be
revealed
a
voice
of
the
lord
in
the
wilderness
of
fayette
seneca
county
declaring
the
three
witnesses
to
bear
record
of
the
book
the
voice
of
michael
on
the
banks
of
the
susquehanna
detecting
the
devil
when
he
appeared
as
an
angel
of
light
the
voice
of
peter
james
and
john
in
the
wilderness
between
harmony
susquehanna
county
and
colesville
broome
county
on
the
susquehanna
river
declaring
themselves
as
possessing
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
and
of
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
and
again
the
voice
of
god
in
the
chamber
of
old
father
whitmer
in
fayette
seneca
county
and
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
places
through
all
the
travels
and
tribulations
of
this
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
and
the
voice
of
michael
the
archangel
the
voice
of
gabriel
and
of
raphael
and
of
divers
angels
from
michael
or
adam
down
to
the
present
time
all
declaring
their
dispensation
their
rights
their
keys
their
honors
their
majesty
and
glory
and
the
power
of
their
priesthood
giving
line
upon
line
precept
upon
precept
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
giving
us
consolation
by
holding
forth
that
which
is
to
come
confirming
our
hope
hence
their
priesthood
was
everlasting
it
administered
in
time
and
in
eternity
in
consonance
with
the
same
idea
is
a
remark
made
by
a
mighty
angel
to
be
found
in
the
revelation
received
by
john
on
the
isle
of
patmos
after
this
angel
had
communicated
to
john
many
great
and
important
events
yet
to
transpire
the
apostle
was
so
overawed
by
his
presence
that
he
fell
at
his
feet
to
worship
him
whereas
the
angel
said
see
that
thou
do
it
not
i
am
thy
fellow
servant
and
of
thy
brethren
that
have
kept
the
testimony
of
jesus
worship
god
for
the
testimony
of
jesus
is
the
spirit
of
prophecy
xix
in
other
words
he
had
held
the
holy
priesthood
on
the
earth
and
had
officiated
therein
he
had
been
subjected
to
all
the
obloquy
contumely
and
reproach
which
the
prophets
of
god
generally
suffered
but
now
the
scene
was
changed
he
was
officiating
in
another
sphere
and
was
revealing
unto
the
apostle
john
who
had
a
peculiar
mission
on
the
earth
some
of
the
great
and
important
truths
or
events
that
should
be
developed
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
of
god
all
of
these
men
having
held
the
everlasting
priesthood
on
earth
still
retain
the
power
and
authority
conferred
upon
them
and
stand
forth
as
prominent
examples
of
the
perpetuity
of
the
everlasting
priesthood
administering
on
the
earth
or
in
the
heavens
as
the
purposes
of
god
and
the
fulfilment
of
their
duties
render
necessary

there
are
eternal
unchangeable
laws
associated
with
god
and
with
all
his
plans
his
works
and
ways
the
requirements
of
which
must
be
met
nor
can
they
be
evaded
or
changed
except
on
certain
principles
provided
for
and
contained
in
the
laws
themselves
when
man
had
transgressed
an
atonement
had
to
be
made
commensurate
with
the
act
and
fully
adequate
to
meet
the
inexorable
demands
of
justice
so
that
as
stated
justice
might
be
satisfied
which
if
it
had
not
been
the
law
pertaining
to
this
matter
could
not
have
been
carried
out
and
must
necessarily
have
been
violated
all
the
works
of
god
connected
with
the
world
which
we
inhabit
and
with
all
other
worlds
are
strictly
governed
by
law
so
accurate
are
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
that
even
with
our
limited
knowledge
we
can
compute
after
the
departure
of
most
of
these
bodies
the
time
of
their
return
to
a
minute
the
sun
rises
and
sets
with
great
regularity
and
we
can
tell
to
a
moment
by
calculating
the
revolution
of
the
earth
at
what
time
it
will
make
its
appearance
in
the
morning
and
disappear
in
the
evening
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
moon
the
whole
of
the
solar
system
and
to
all
bodies
that
can
be
reached
by
our
instruments
there
is
perfect
regularity
exactitude
and
order
associated
with
all
worlds
a
departure
from
which
would
produce
incalculable
evil
and
irretrievable
destruction
and
ruin
with
regard
to
the
matter
of
which
the
earth
is
composed
it
is
also
governed
by
strict
unchangeable
laws
matter
possessing
the
same
properties
under
the
same
conditions
in
all
parts
of
the
world
the
various
grasses
herbs
plants
shrubs
flowers
minerals
metals
waters
fluids
or
gases
when
under
the
same
conditions
are
subject
to
or
governed
by
unchangeable
laws
and
by
those
laws
chemists
or
scientists
are
enabled
to
apply
tests
to
demonstrate
the
properties
of
the
various
elements
in
nature
which
they
find
are
always
immutable
and
the
same
degree
of
accuracy
applies
to
the
laws
and
various
formations
of
crystallization
under
the
same
circumstances
the
animal
and
vegetable
creations
are
governed
by
certain
laws
and
are
composed
of
certain
elements
peculiar
to
themselves
this
applies
to
man
to
the
beasts
fowls
fish
and
creeping
things
to
the
insects
and
to
all
animated
nature
each
one
possessing
its
own
distinctive
features
each
requiring
a
specific
sustenance
each
having
an
organism
and
faculties
governed
by
prescribed
laws
to
perpetuate
its
own
kind
so
accurate
is
the
formation
of
the
various
living
creatures
that
an
intelligent
student
of
nature
can
tell
by
any
particular
bone
of
the
skeleton
of
an
animal
to
what
class
or
order
it
belongs
these
principles
do
not
change
as
represented
by
evolutionists
of
the
darwinian
school
but
the
primitive
organisms
of
all
living
beings
exist
in
the
same
form
as
when
they
first
received
their
impress
from
their
maker
there
are
indeed
some
very
slight
exceptions
as
for
instance
the
ass
may
mix
with
the
mare
and
produce
the
mule
but
there
it
ends
the
violation
of
the
laws
of
procreation
receives
a
check
and
its
operations
can
go
no
further
similar
compounds
may
possibly
be
made
by
experimentalists
in
the
vegetable
and
mineral
kingdoms
but
the
original
elements
remain
the
same
yet
this
is
not
the
normal
but
an
abnormal
condition
with
them
as
with
animals
birds
etc
and
if
we
take
man
he
is
said
to
have
been
made
in
the
image
of
god
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
is
a
son
of
god
and
being
his
son
he
is
of
course
his
offspring
an
emanation
from
god
in
whose
likeness
we
are
told
he
is
made
he
did
not
originate
from
a
chaotic
mass
of
matter
moving
or
inert
but
came
forth
possessing
in
an
embryotic
state
all
the
faculties
and
powers
of
a
god
and
when
he
shall
be
perfected
and
have
progressed
to
maturity
he
will
be
like
his
father
a
god
being
indeed
his
offspring
as
the
horse
the
ox
the
sheep
and
every
living
creature
including
man
propagates
its
own
species
and
perpetuates
its
own
kind
so
does
god
perpetuate
his
there
are
different
organisms
possessing
different
qualities
from
which
the
same
results
are
uniformly
obtained
the
body
of
a
sheep
produces
wool
that
of
a
goat
produces
hair
the
flesh
of
certain
kinds
of
fish
produces
scales
the
flesh
of
birds
produces
feathers
and
by
the
coverings
of
the
various
kinds
of
animals
birds
and
fishes
may
their
originals
be
known
it
is
true
that
some
of
these
coverings
may
be
slightly
changed
by
a
removal
of
the
creature
from
the
arctic
to
the
torrid
zone
or
vice
versa
wool
may
assume
a
nearer
approach
to
hair
in
length
and
texture
or
hair
may
become
more
woolly
but
these
modifications
are
slight
and
this
covering
of
the
animal
is
predisposed
to
return
to
its
original
qualities
when
the
creature
is
replaced
in
his
natural
habitat
paul
in
speaking
on
the
resurrection
refers
to
the
different
qualities
of
flesh
as
follows
but
god
giveth
it
a
body
as
it
hath
pleased
him
and
to
every
seed
his
own
body
all
flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh
but
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
men
another
flesh
of
beasts
another
of
fishes
and
another
of
birds
xv
these
different
qualities
seem
to
be
inherent
in
the
several
species
as
much
so
as
the
properties
of
silver
gold
copper
iron
and
other
minerals
are
inherent
in
the
matter
in
which
they
are
contained
whilst
herbs
according
to
their
kind
possess
their
specific
properties
or
as
the
leading
properties
of
earth
air
and
water
are
distinct
from
one
another
and
hence
on
physiological
grounds
this
principle
being
admitted
and
it
can
not
be
controverted
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
the
tissues
of
the
lower
or
indeed
of
any
order
of
fishes
and
make
of
them
an
ox
a
bird
or
a
man
as
impossible
as
it
would
be
to
take
iron
and
make
it
into
gold
silver
or
copper
or
to
produce
other
changes
in
the
laws
which
govern
any
kind
of
matter
and
when
the
resurrection
and
exaltation
of
man
shall
be
consummated
although
more
pure
refined
and
glorious
yet
will
he
still
be
in
the
same
image
and
have
the
same
likeness
without
variation
or
change
in
any
of
his
parts
or
faculties
except
the
substitution
of
spirit
for
blood
this
principle
of
exactitude
in
all
the
works
of
god
represents
the
principles
that
dwell
in
god
himself
he
is
called
in
scripture
the
i
am
in
other
words
i
am
that
i
am
because
of
those
inherent
principles
which
are
also
eternal
and
unchangeable
for
where
those
principles
exist
he
exists
and
when
speaking
of
the
worlds
by
which
we
are
surrounded
it
is
said
behold
all
these
are
kingdoms
and
any
man
who
hath
seen
any
or
the
least
of
these
hath
seen
god
moving
in
his
majesty
and
doc
and
sec
lxxxviii
and
again
it
is
written
he
comprehendeth
all
things
and
all
things
are
before
him
and
all
things
are
round
about
him
and
he
is
above
all
things
and
in
all
things
and
is
through
all
things
and
is
round
about
all
things
and
all
things
are
by
him
and
of
him
even
god
for
ever
and
ever
and
again
verily
i
say
unto
you
he
hath
given
a
law
unto
all
things
by
which
they
move
in
their
times
and
their
seasons
and
again
in
the
same
revelation
we
read
as
also
he
is
in
the
sun
and
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
power
thereof
by
which
it
was
made
as
also
he
is
in
the
moon
and
is
the
light
of
the
moon
and
the
power
thereof
by
which
it
was
made
as
also
the
light
of
the
stars
and
the
power
thereof
by
which
they
were
made
and
the
earth
also
and
the
power
thereof
even
the
earth
upon
which
you
stand
and
the
light
which
now
shineth
which
giveth
you
light
is
through
him
who
enlighteneth
your
eyes
which
is
the
same
light
that
quickeneth
your
understandings
which
light
proceedeth
forth
from
the
presence
of
god
to
fill
the
immensity
of
space
the
light
which
is
in
all
things
which
giveth
life
to
all
things
which
is
the
law
by
which
all
things
are
governed
even
the
power
of
god
who
sitteth
upon
his
throne
who
is
in
the
bosom
of
eternity
who
is
in
the
midst
of
all
things
the
world
was
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
was
made
and
therefore
having
made
all
things
he
has
given
to
all
things
a
law
and
hence
those
laws
which
we
have
briefly
alluded
to
are
the
productions
of
his
comprehensive
intelligent
and
infinite
mind
he
is
the
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
fountain
of
all
life
of
all
light
of
all
truth
of
all
intelligence
of
all
existence
he
is
also
the
sustainer
of
all
life
and
all
light
in
all
created
beings
in
him
all
animal
life
of
every
form
has
its
being
there
are
some
apparent
deviations
from
general
laws
but
these
apparent
deviations
are
merely
appendages
to
the
great
general
law
in
order
that
creation
may
be
perfect
in
all
its
parts
for
instance
there
is
a
general
law
of
what
is
termed
gravitation
which
causes
bodies
to
fall
to
the
earth
from
a
given
height
with
the
same
velocity
according
to
their
specific
gravity
but
there
are
other
local
laws
which
disturb
the
normal
conditions
so
far
as
they
extend
of
what
may
be
termed
the
general
law
as
for
example
the
magnet
in
its
limited
sphere
is
more
powerful
than
the
general
law
of
gravity
it
attracting
certain
matter
to
itself
in
opposition
to
the
general
law
while
the
magnet
itself
is
subject
to
the
general
law
there
is
also
another
principle
called
capillary
attraction
which
causes
water
and
other
fluids
to
ascend
in
the
earth
in
tubes
etc
take
away
these
local
agencies
and
everything
resumes
its
normal
condition
a
bird
through
the
use
of
its
wings
possesses
the
power
of
locomotion
through
the
air
let
that
bird
however
lose
its
mechanism
and
power
by
being
maimed
or
killed
and
it
is
governed
by
the
same
law
of
gravitation
and
drops
to
the
earth
balloons
will
ascend
and
carry
a
specified
weight
with
them
to
great
altitudes
but
this
is
owing
to
a
modification
of
one
part
of
the
law
of
gravitation
which
causes
denser
bodies
to
cling
with
greater
tenacity
to
the
earth
and
the
gas
that
enters
the
balloons
is
more
rarified
than
the
atmosphere
immediately
contiguous
to
the
earth
which
dense
atmosphere
forces
the
lighter
gases
to
their
proper
place
causing
them
to
bound
upwards
this
being
done
and
the
equilibrium
obtained
if
the
gas
is
permitted
to
escape
the
materials
of
which
the
balloon
is
composed
together
with
its
occupants
are
precipitated
according
to
the
general
laws
of
gravitation
to
the
earth
god
is
unchangeable
so
are
also
his
laws
in
all
their
forms
and
in
all
their
applications
and
being
himself
the
essence
of
law
the
giver
of
law
the
sustainer
of
law
all
of
those
laws
are
eternal
in
all
their
operations
in
all
bodies
and
matter
and
throughout
all
space
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
violate
law
because
in
so
doing
he
would
strike
at
his
own
dignity
power
principles
glory
exaltation
and
existence
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
states
and
again
verily
i
say
unto
you
that
which
is
governed
by
law
is
also
preserved
by
law
and
perfected
and
sanctified
by
the
same
that
which
breaketh
a
law
and
abideth
not
by
law
but
seeketh
to
become
a
law
unto
itself
and
willeth
to
abide
in
sin
and
altogether
abideth
in
sin
can
not
be
sanctified
by
law
neither
by
mercy
justice
nor
judgment
therefore
they
must
remain
filthy
still
all
kingdoms
have
a
law
given
and
there
are
many
kingdoms
for
there
is
no
space
in
the
which
there
is
no
kingdom
and
there
is
no
kingdom
in
which
there
is
no
space
either
a
greater
or
a
lesser
kingdom
and
unto
every
kingdom
is
given
a
law
and
unto
every
law
there
are
certain
bounds
also
and
conditions
all
beings
who
abide
not
in
those
conditions
are
not
justified
for
intelligence
cleaveth
unto
intelligence
wisdom

truth

mercy

goeth
before

face
of
him
who
sitteth
upon
the

lxxxviii
hence
the
law
of
atonement
had
to
be
met
as
well
as
all
other
laws
for
god
could
not
be
god
without
fulfilling
it
jesus
said
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
but
it
was
not
possible
for
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
law
and
he
had
to
take
it
the
atonement
must
be
made
a
god
must
be
sacrificed
no
power
can
resist
a
law
of
god
it
is
omnipresent
omnipotent
exists
everywhere
in
all
things
through
all
things
and
round
about
all
things
we
read
o
the
greatness
of
the
mercy
of
our
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
for
he
delivereth
his
saints
from
that
awful
monster
the
devil
and
death
and
hell
and
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
endless
torment
o
how
great
the
holiness
of
our
god
for
he
knoweth
all
things
and
there
is
not
any
thing
save
he
knows
it
and
he
cometh
into
the
world
that
he
may
save
all
men
if
they
will
hearken
unto
his
voice
for
behold
he
suffereth
the
pains
of
all
men
yea
the
pains
of
every
living
creature
both
men
women
and
children
who
belong
to
the
family
of
adam
and
he
suffereth
this
that
the
resurrection
might
pass
upon
all
men
that
all
might
stand
before
him
at
the
great
and
judgment
day
and
he
commandeth
all
men
that
they
must
repent
and
be
baptized
in
his
name
having
perfect
faith
in
the
holy
one
of
israel
or
they
can
not
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
if
they
will
not
repent
and
believe
in
his
name
and
be
baptized
in
his
name
and
endure
to
the
end
they
must
be
damned
for
the
lord
god
the
holy
one
of
israel
has
spoken
it
wherefore
he
has
given
a
law
and
where
there
is
no
law
given
there
is
no
punishment
and
where
there
is
no
punishment
there
is
no
condemnation
and
where
there
is
no
condemnation
the
mercies
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
have
claim
upon
them
because
of
the
atonement
for
they
are
delivered
by
the
power
of
him
for
the
atonement
satisfieth
the
demands
of
his
justice
upon
all
those
who
have
not
the
law
given
to
them
that
they
are
delivered
from
that
awful
monster
death
and
hell
and
the
devil
and
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
which
is
endless
torment
and
they
are
restored
to
that
god
who
gave
them
breath
which
is
the
holy
one
of
israel
but
wo
unto
him
that
has
the
law
given
yea
that
has
all
the
commandments
of
god
like
unto
us
and
that
transgresseth
them
and
that
wasteth
the
days
of
his
probation

awful

the
results

the

paid

and

extracts
from
the
teachings
of
alma
and
others
from
the
facts
in
the
case
and
the
testimony
presented
in
the
scriptures
it
becomes
evident
that
through
the
great
atonement
the
expiatory
sacrifice
of
the
son
of
god
it
is
made
possible
that
man
can
be
redeemed
restored
resurrected
and
exalted
to
the
elevated
position
designed
for
him
in
the
creation
as
a
son
of
god
that
eternal
justice
and
law
required
the
penalty
to
be
paid
by
man
himself
or
by
the
atonement
of
the
son
of
god
that
jesus
offered
himself
as
the
great
expiatory
sacrifice
that
this
offering
being
in
accordance
with
the
demands
or
requirements
of
the
law
was
accepted
by
the
great
lawgiver
that
it
was
prefigured
by
sacrifices
and
ultimately
fulfilled
by
himself
according
to
the
eternal
covenant
he
was
wounded
as
prophesied
of
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
the
savior
thus
becomes
master
of
the
situation
the
debt
is
paid
the
redemption
made
the
covenant
fulfilled
justice
satisfied
the
will
of
god
done
and
all
power
is
now
given
into
the
hands
of
the
son
of
god
the
power
of
the
resurrection
the
power
of
the
redemption
the
power
of
salvation
the
power
to
enact
laws
for
the
carrying
out
and
accomplishment
of
this
design
hence
life
and
immortality
are
brought
to
light
the
gospel
is
introduced
and
he
becomes
the
author
of
eternal
life
and
exaltation
he
is
the
redeemer
the
resurrector
the
savior
of
man
and
the
world
and
he
has
appointed
the
law
of
the
gospel
as
the
medium
which
must
be
complied
with
in
this
world
or
the
next
as
he
complied
with
his
father
law
hence
he
that
believeth
shall
be
saved
and
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
the

the

of

it

by

and
was
carried
out
and
consummated
on

hence
being
the
mediator
between

he
becomes
by
right
the

all
the

harmonize
in
this
great
grand
momentous
just
equitable
merciful
and
meritorious
act
the
book
of
mormon
is
very
explicit
on
these
principles
we
read
therein
and
behold
i
say
unto
you
this
is
not
all
for
o
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
that
is
the
founder
of
peace
yea
even
the
lord
who
has
redeemed
his
people
yea
him
who
has
granted
salvation
unto
his
people
for
were
it
not
for
the
redemption
which
he
hath
made
for
his
people
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
i
say
unto
you
were
it
not
for
this
all
mankind
must
have
perished
but
behold
the
bands
of
death
shall
be
broken
and
the
son
reigneth
and
hath
power
over
the
dead
therefore
he
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
there
cometh
a
resurrection
even
a
first
resurrection
yea
even
a
resurrection
of
those
that
have
been
and
who
are
and
who
shall
be
even
until
the
resurrection
of
christ
for
so
shall
he
be
called
and
now
the
resurrection
of
all
the
prophets
and
all
those
that
have
believed
in
their
words
or
all
those
that
have
kept
the
commandments
of
god
shall
come
forth
in
the
first
resurrection
therefore
they
are
the
first
resurrection
they
are
raised
to
dwell
with
god
who
has
redeemed
them
thus
they
have
eternal
life
through
christ
who
has
broken
the
bands
of
death
and
these
are
those
who
have
part
in
the
first
resurrection
and
these
are
they
that
have
died
before
christ
came
in
their
ignorance
not
having
salvation
declared
unto
them
and
thus
the
lord
bringeth
about
the
restoration
of
these
and
they
have
a
part
in
the
first
resurrection
or
have
eternal
life
being
redeemed
by
the
lord
and
little
children
also
have
eternal
life
but
behold
and
fear
and
tremble
before
god
for
ye
ought
to
tremble
for
the
lord
redeemeth
none
such
that
rebel
against
him
and
die
in
their
sins
yea
even
all
those
that
have
perished
in
their
sins
ever
since
the
world
began
that
have
wilfully
rebelled
against
god
that
have
known
the
commandments
of
god
and
would
not
keep
them
these
are
they
that
have
no
part
in
the
first
resurrection
therefore
had
ye
not
ought
to
tremble
for
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
none
such
yea
neither
can
the
lord
redeem
such
for
he
can
not
deny
himself
for
he
can
not
deny
justice

it
has
its
claim

the
next
is
a
portion
of
a
sermon
of
the
prophet
amulek
the
companion
of
alma
to
the
zoramites
my
brother
has
called
upon
the
words
of
zenos
that
redemption
cometh
through
the
son
of
god
and
also
upon
the
words
of
zenoch
and
also
he
has
appealed
unto
moses
to
prove
that
these
things
are
true
and
now
behold
i
will
testify
unto
you
of
myself
that
these
things
are
true
behold
i
say
unto
you
that
i
do
know
that
christ
shall
come
among
the
children
of
men
to
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
his
people
and
that
he
shall
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
it
for
it
is
expedient
that
an
atonement
should
be
made
for
according
to
the
great
plan
of
the
eternal
god
there
must
be
an
atonement
made
or
else
all
mankind
must
unavoidably
perish
yea
all
are
hardened
yea
all
are
fallen
and
are
lost
and
must
perish
except
it
be
through
the
atonement
which
it
is
expedient
should
be
made
for
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sacrifice
yea
not
a
sacrifice
of
man
neither
of
beast
neither
of
any
manner
of
fowl
for
it
shall
not
be
a
human
sacrifice
but
it
must
be
an
infinite
and
eternal
sacrifice
now
there
is
not
any
man
that
can
sacrifice
his
own
blood
which
will
atone
for
the
sins
of
another
now
if
a
man
murdereth
behold
will
our
law
which
is
just
take
the
life
of
his
brother
i
say
unto
you
nay
but
the
law
requireth
the
life
of
him
who
hath
murdered
therefore
there
can
be
nothing
which
is
short
of
an
infinite
atonement
which
will
suffice
for
the
sins
of
the
world
therefore
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sacrifice
and
then
shall
there
be
or
it
is
expedient
there
should
be
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
blood
then
shall
the
law
of
moses
be
fulfilled
yea
it
shall
be
all
fulfilled
every
jot
and
tittle
and
none
shall
have
passed
away
and
behold
this
is
the
whole
meaning
of
the
law
every
whit
pointing
to
that
great
and
last
sacrifice
and
that
great
and
last
sacrifice
will
be
the
son
of
god
yea
infinite
and
eternal
and
thus
he
shall
bring
salvation
to
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
his
name
this
being
the
intent
of
this
last
sacrifice
to
bring
about
the
bowels
of
mercy
which
overpowereth
justice
and
bringeth
about
means
unto
men
that
they
may
have
faith
unto
repentance
and
thus
mercy
can
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
and
encircles
them
in
the
arms
of
safety
while
he
that
exercises
no
faith
unto
repentance
is
exposed
to
the
whole
law
of
the
demands
of
justice
therefore
only
unto
him
that
has
faith
unto
repentance
is
brought
about
the
great
and
eternal
plan
of
redemption
therefore
may
god
grant
unto
you
my
brethren
that
ye
may
begin
to
exercise
your
faith
unto
repentance
that
ye
begin
to
call
upon
his
holy
name
that
he
would
have
mercy
upon
you
alma
xxxiv
and
again
to
quote
from
the
commandments
of
alma
to
his
son
corianton
and
now
my
son
i
perceive
there
is
somewhat
more
which
doth
worry
your
mind
which
ye
can
not
understand
which
is
concerning
the
justice
of
god
in
the
punishment
of
the
sinner
for
ye
do
try
to
suppose
that
it
is
injustice
that
the
sinner
should
be
consigned
to
a
state
of
misery
now
behold
my
son
i
will
explain
this
thing
unto
thee
for
behold
after
the
lord
god
sent
our
first
parents
forth
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
they
were
taken
yea
he
drew
out
the
man
and
he
placed
at
the
east
end
of
the
garden
of
eden
cherubim
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turned
every
way
to
keep
the
tree
of
life
now
we
see
that
the
man
had
become
as
god
knowing
good
and
evil
and
lest
he
should
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
for
ever
the
lord
god
placed
cherubim
and
the
flaming
sword
that
he
should
not
partake
of
the
fruit
and
thus
we
see
that
there
was
a
time
granted
unto
man
to
repent
yea
a
probationary
time
a
time
to
repent
and
serve
god
for
behold
if
adam
had
put
forth
his
hand
immediately
and
partook
of
the
tree
of
life
he
would
have
lived
for
ever
according
to
the
word
of
god
having
no
space
for
repentance
yea
and
also
the
word
of
god
would
have
been
void
and
the
great
plan
of
salvation
would
have
been
frustrated
but
behold
it
was
appointed
unto
man
to
die
therefore
as
they
were
cut
off
from
the
tree
of
life
they
should
be
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
man
become
lost
for
ever
yea
they
became
fallen
man
and
now
we
see
by
this
that
our
parents
were
cut
off
both
temporally
and
spiritually
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
thus
we
see
they
became
subjects
to
follow
after
their
own
will
now
behold
it
was
not
expedient
that
man
should
be
reclaimed
from
this
temporal
death
for
that
would
destroy
the
great
plan
of
happiness
therefore
as
the
soul
could
never
die
and
the
fall
had
brought
upon
all
mankind
a
spiritual
death
as
well
as
a
temporal
that
is
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
it
was
expedient
that
mankind
should
be
reclaimed
from
this
spiritual
death
therefore
as
they
had
become
carnal
sensual
and
devilish
by
nature
this
probationary
state
became
a
state
for
them
to
prepare
it
became
a
preparatory
state
and
now
remember
my
son
if
it
were
not
for
the
plan
of
redemption
laying
it
aside
as
soon
as
they
were
dead
their
souls
were
miserable
being
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
now
there
was
no
means
to
reclaim
men
from
this
fallen
state
which
man
had
brought
upon
himself
because
of
his
own
disobedience
therefore
according
to
justice
the
plan
of
redemption
could
not
be
brought
about
only
on
conditions
of
repentance
of
men
in
this
probationary
state
yea
this
preparatory
state
for
except
it
were
for
these
conditions
mercy
could
not
take
effect
except
it
should
destroy
the
work
of
justice
now
the
work
of
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
if
so
god
would
cease
to
be
god
and
thus
we
see
that
all
mankind
were
fallen
and
they
were
in
the
grasp
of
justice
yea
the
justice
of
god
which
consigned
them
for
ever
to
be
cut
off
from
his
presence
and
now
the
plan
of
mercy
could
not
be
brought
about
except
an
atonement
should
be
made
therefore
god
himself
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
the
world
to
bring
about
the
plan
of
mercy
to
appease
the
demands
of
justice
that
god
might
be
a
perfect
just
god
and
a
merciful
god
also
now
repentance
could
not
come
unto
men
except
there
were
a
punishment
which
also
was
eternal
as
the
life
of
the
soul
should
be
affixed
opposite
to
the
plan
of
happiness
which
was
as
eternal
also
as
the
life
of
the
soul
now
how
could
a
man
repent
except
he
should
sin
how
could
he
sin
if
there
was
no
law
how
could
there
be
a
law
save
there
was
a
punishment
now
there
was
a
punishment
affixed
and
a
just
law
given
which
brought
remorse
of
conscience
unto
man
now
if
there
was
no
law
given
if
a
man
murdered
he
should
die
would
he
be
afraid
he
would
die
if
he
should
murder
and
also
if
there
was
no
law
given
against
sin
men
would
not
be
afraid
to
sin
and
if
there
was
no
law
given
if
men
sinned
what
could
justice
do
or
mercy
either
for
they
would
have
no
claim
upon
the
creature
but
there
is
a
law
given
and
a
punishment
affixed
and
a
repentance
granted
which
repentance
mercy
claimeth
otherwise
justice
claimeth
the
creature
and
executeth
the
law
and
the
law
inflicteth
the
punishment
if
not
so
the
works
of
justice
would
be
destroyed
and
god
would
cease
to
be
god
but
god
ceaseth
not
to
be
god
and
mercy
claimeth
the
penitent
and
mercy
cometh
because
of
the
atonement
and
the
atonement
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
bringeth
back
men
into
the
presence
of
god
and
thus
they
are
restored
into
his
presence
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
according
to
the
law
and
justice
for
behold
justice
exerciseth
all
his
demands
and
also
mercy
claimeth
all
which
is
her
own
and
thus
none
but
the
truly
penitent
are
saved
what
do
ye
suppose
that
mercy
can
rob
justice
i
say
unto
you
nay
not
one
whit
if
so
god
would
cease
to
be
god
and
thus
god
bringeth
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposes
which
were
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
thus
cometh
about
the
salvation
and
the
redemption
of
men
and
also
their
destruction
and
misery
alma
xlii
in
the
first
place
according
to
justice
men
could
not
have
been
redeemed
from
temporal
death
except
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
and
in
the
second
place
they
could
not
be
redeemed
from
spiritual
death
only
through
obedience
to
his
law
chapter
xxv
the
resurrection
the
universality
of
the
atonement
the
promises
to
those
who
overcome
the
gospel
its
first
principles
faith
repentance
baptism
and
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
its
antiquity
it
is
preached
in
various
dispensations
from
adam
until
the
present
the
final
triumph
of
the
saints
the
great
having
been
fulfilled
it
now
becomes
our
duty
to
enquire
what
next
had
to
be
done
to
consummate
the
great
object
obtainable
through
the
fulfilment
of
this
law
or
what
was
accomplished
by
the
atonement
first
the
resurrection
the
penalty
of
the
broken
law
in
adam
day
was
death
and
death
is
passed
upon
all
the
word
of
the
lord
was
in
the
day
that
thou
eatest
thereof
thou
shalt
surely
die
the
atonement
made
by
jesus
christ
brought
about
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
restored
life
and
hence
jesus
said
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
jesus
himself
became
the
first
fruits
of
those
who
slept
the
next
question
that
arises
is
how
far
does
this
principle
extend
and
to
whom
is
it
applicable
it
extends
to
all
the
human
family
to
all
men
of
every
nation
as
it
is
written
for
if
by
one
man
offence
death
reigneth
by
one
much
more
they
which
receive
abundance
of
grace
and
of
the
gift
of
righteousness
shall
reign
in
life
by
one
jesus
christ
therefore
as
by
the
offence
of
one
judgment
came
upon
all
men
to
condemnation
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
free
gift
came
upon
all
men
unto
justification
of
life
romans
v
this
will
not
all
take
place
at
once
but
every
man
in
his
own
order
christ
the
first
fruits
afterward
they
that
are
christ
at
his
coming
xv
but
the
rest
of
the
dead
lived
not
again
until
the
thousand
years
were
finished
xx
hence
what
was
lost
in
adam
was
restored
in
jesus
christ
so
far
as
all
men
are
concerned
in
all
ages
with
some
very
slight
exceptions
arising
from
an
abuse
of
privileges
transgression
of
the
law
brought
death
upon
all
the
posterity
of
adam
the
restoration
through
the
atonement
restored
all
the
human
family
to
life
for
since
by
man
came
death
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
for
as
in
adam
all
die
even
so
in
christ
shall
all
be
made
alive
so
that
whatever
was
lost
by
adam
was
restored
by
jesus
christ
the
penalty
of
the
transgression
of
the
law
was
the
death
of
the
body
the
atonement
made
by
jesus
christ
resulted
in
the
resurrection
of
the
human
body
its
scope
embraced
all
peoples
nations
and
tongues
for
all
my
lord
was
crucified
for
all
for
all
my
savior
died
this
is
one
part
of
the
restoration
this
is
the
restoration
of
the
body
the
next
question
for
us
to
examine
is
how
and
in
what
manner
are
men
benefitted
by
the
atonement
and
by
the
resurrection
in
this
that
the
atonement
having
restored
man
to
his
former
position
before
the
lord
it
has
placed
him
in
a
position
and
made
it
possible
for
him
to
obtain
that
exaltation
and
glory
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
received
without
it
even
to
become
a
son
of
god
by
adoption
and
being
a
son
then
an
heir
of
god
and
a
joint
heir
with
jesus
christ
and
that
as
christ
overcame
he
has
made
it
possible
and
has
placed
it
within
the
power
of
believers
in
him
also
to
overcome
and
as
he
is
authorized
to
inherit
his
father
glory
which
he
had
with
him
before
the
world
was
with
his
resurrected
body
so
through
the
adoption
may
we
overcome
and
sit
down
with
him
upon
his
throne
as
he
has
overcome
and
has
sat
down
upon
his
throne
and
as
he
has
said
i
and
the
father
are
one
so
are
the
obedient
saints
one
with
him
as
he
is
one
with
the
father
even
as
he
prayed
that
they
all
may
be
one
as
thou
father
art
in
me
and
i
in
thee
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
us
that
the
world
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
and
the
glory
which
thou
gavest
me
i
have
given
them
that
they
may
be
one
even
as
we
are
one
i
in
them
and
thou
in
me
that
they
may
be
made
perfect
in
one
and
that
the
world
may
know
that
thou
hast
sent
me
and
hast
loved
them
as
thou
hast
loved
me
john
xvii
being
the
sons
of
god
through
the
atonement
and
adoption
and
through
faith
in
jesus
christ
they
rise
to
the
dignity
and
glory
of
the
godhead
even
to
be
gods
as
it
is
promised
him
that
overcometh
will
i
make
a
pillar
in
the
temple
of
my
god
and
he
shall
go
no
more
out
and
i
will
write
upon
him
the
name
of
my
god
and
the
name
of
the
city
of
my
god
which
is
new
jerusalem
which
cometh
down
out
of
heaven
from
my
god
and
i
will
write
upon
him
my
new
name
iii
again
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
even
as
i
also
overcame
and
am
set
down
with
my
father
in
his
throne
iii
yet
again
he
that
overcometh
shall
inherit
all
things
and
i
will
be
his
god
and
he
shall
be
my
son
xxi
hence
through
his
atonement
believers
in
christ
and
those
who
obey
his
law
partake
of
his
glory
and
exaltation
and
are
inheritors
of
the
godhead
whilst
those
who
do
not
obey
his
law
although
resurrected
can
not
inherit
this
exaltation
they
are
raised
from
the
dead
but
can
not
inherit
a
celestial
glory
without
being
obedient
to
a
celestial
law
and
thus
we
come
again
to
a
scripture
quoted
before
jesus
said
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behooved
christ
to
suffer
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
the
third
day
and
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
name
among
all
nations
beginning
at
jerusalem
having
noticed
the
great
blessings
privileges
powers
and
exaltations
that
are
placed
within
the
reach
of
man
through
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
it
next
becomes
our
duty
to
enquire
what
is
required
of
man
to
place
him
in
possession
of
them
that
the
world
might
be
benefitted
through
the
redemption
brought
about
by
jesus
christ
he
called
and
ordained
twelve
apostles
and
commanded
them
to
go
forth
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
saying
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
or
condemned
thus
placing
it
within
the
reach
of
every
man
to
obtain
the
glory
and
exaltation
referred
to
above
and
leaving
all
men
without
excuse
who
would
not
obey
the
law
and
be
subject
to
the
conditions
imposed
the
penalty
of
adam
sin
having
been
removed
through
the
atonement
it
now
became
the
privilege
of
all
men
in
all
nations
to
partake
of
the
salvation
provided
by
the
great
mediator
and
this
provision
applies
not
only
to
the
living
but
also
to
the
dead
so
that
all
men
who
have
existed
in
all
ages
who
do
exist
now
or
who
will
exist
while
the
earth
shall
stand
may
be
placed
upon
the
same
footing
and
that
all
men
may
have
the
privilege
living
or
dead
of
accepting
the
conditions
of
the
great
plan
of
redemption
provided
by
the
father
through
the
son
before
the
world
was
and
that
the
justice
and
mercy
of
god
may
be
applied
to
every
being
living
or
dead
that
ever
has
existed
that
does
now
exist
or
that
ever
will
exist
the
conditions
required
of
the
human
family
to
enable
them
to
obtain
the
high
exaltation
which
the
atonement
makes
it
possible
for
them
to
receive
are
first
faith
in
god
as
our
father
and
the
great
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
in
whose
hands
are
the
destinies
of
the
human
family
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
and
in
his
son
jesus
christ
as
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
as
the
great
mediator
and
great
propitiatory
sacrifice
provided
by
the
father
before
the
creation
and
consummated
by
the
offering
of
himself
upon
the
cross
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
life
or
to
use
the
words
of
the
nephite
king
benjamin
believe
in
god
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
created
all
things
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believe
that
he
has
all
wisdom
and
all
power
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believe
that
man
doth
not
comprehend
all
the
things
which
the
lord
can
comprehend
or
as
paul
writes
he
that
cometh
to
god
must
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
a
rewarder
of
them
that
diligently
seek
him
the
second
principle
of
the
gospel
of
salvation
is
repentance
it
is
a
sincere
and
godly
sorrow
for
and
a
forsaking
of
sin
combined
with
full
purpose
of
heart
to
keep
god
commandments
as
is
written
by
the
prophet
isaiah
let
the
wicked
forsake
his
way
and
the
unrighteous
man
his
thoughts
and
let
him
return
unto
the
lord
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
him
and
to
our
god
for
he
will
abundantly
pardon
and
to
quote
from
the
book
of
mormon
and
again
believe
that
ye
must
repent
of
your
sins
and
forsake
them
and
humble
yourselves
before
god
and
ask
in
sincerity
of
heart
that
he
would
forgive
you
and
now
if
you
believe
all
these
things
see
that
ye
do
them
mosiah
iv
thirdly
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
of
our
personal
transgressions
which
through
this
means
provided
by
divine
mercy
are
by
reason
of
the
atonement
blotted
out
to
use
the
words
of
paul
therefore
we
are
buried
with
him
by
baptism
into
death
that
like
as
christ
was
raised
up
from
the
dead
by
the
glory
of
the
father
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
life
for
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
death
we
shall
be
also
in
the
likeness
of
his
resurrection
next
the
reception
of
the
holy
ghost
through
the
laying
on
of
hands
of
those
who
have
received
the
holy
priesthood
and
are
duly
authorized
ordained
and
empowered
to
impart
this
blessing
thus
peter
preached
on
the
day
of
pentecost
repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
for
the
promise
is
unto
you
and
to
your
children
and
to
all
that
are
afar
off
even
as
many
as
the
lord
our
god
shall
call
acts
ii
these
are
the
introductory
or
first
principles
of
the
everlasting
unchangeable
gospel
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
that
is
and
has
been
the
same
to
all
men
amongst
all
nations
in
all
ages
whenever
or
wherever
it
has
been
taught
by
the
authority
of
heaven
hence
we
read
it
was
preached
from
the
beginning
being
declared
by
holy
angels
sent
from
the
presence
of
god
and
by
his
own
voice
and
by
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
thus
all
things
were
confirmed
unto
adam
by
an
holy
ordinance
and
the
gospel
preached
and
a
decree
sent
forth
that
it
should
be
in
the
world
until
the
end
thereof
pearl
of
great
price
and
in
that
day
the
lord
god
called
upon
men
by
the
holy
ghost
everywhere
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
repent
and
as
many
as
believed
in
the
son
and
repented
of
their
sins
should
be
saved
and
as
many
as
believed
not
and
repented
not
should
be
damned
and
the
words
went
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
in
a
firm
decree
wherefore
they
must
be
ibid
this
same
gospel
was
preached
to
seth
and
to
all
the
antediluvian
patriarchs
and
they
ministered
under
its
authority
by
its
power
as
we
have
already
shown
enoch
and
his
people
were
translated
of
noah
it
is
written
and
the
lord
ordained
noah
after
his
own
order
and
commanded
him
that
he
should
go
forth
and
declare
his
gospel
unto
the
children
of
men
even
as
it
was
given
unto
enoch
and
further
to
quote
from
the
testimony
of
noah
before
the
flood
and
it
came
to
pass
that
noah
continued
his
preaching
unto
the
people
saying
hearken
and
give
heed
unto
my
words
believe
and
repent
of
your
sins
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
even
as
our
fathers
did
and
ye
shall
receive
the
holy
ghost
that
ye
may
have
all
things
made
manifest
and
if
ye
do
not
this
the
floods
will
come
in
upon
you
from
this
we
learn
that
the
principles
of
the
gospel
in
the
first
ages
of
the
world
were
identical
with
those
taught
in
our
day
the
gospel
and
the
holy
priesthood
continued
from
noah
to
abraham
abraham
received
the
priesthood
from
melchizedek
who
received
it
through
the
lineage
of
his
fathers
even
till
noah
doc
and
lxxxiv
p
as
paul
writes
and
the
scripture
foreseeing
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
preached
before
the
gospel
unto
abraham
saying
in
thee
shall
all
nations
be
blessed
whilst
jesus
declared
abraham
saw
my
day
and
was
glad
the
knowledge
and
practice
of
the
gospel
were
perpetuated
through
isaac
jacob
joseph
and
other
patriarchs
until
the
age
of
moses
who
it
is
said
esteemed
the
reproach
of
christ
greater
riches
than
the
treasures
in
egypt
and
of
the
israelites
of
whom
he
was
the
great
lawgiver
paul
writes
moreover
brethren
i
would
not
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
how
that
all
our
fathers
were
under
the
cloud
and
all
passed
through
the
sea
and
were
all
baptized
unto
moses
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
and
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
meat
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink
for
they
drank
of
that
spiritual
rock
that
followed
them
and
that
rock
was
christ
but
with
many
of
them
god
was
not
pleased
for
they
were
overthrown
in
the
wilderness
x
the
further
history
of
the
gospel
in
its
relation
to
the
house
of
israel
is
briefly
told
in
the
following
paragraphs
from
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
now
this
moses
plainly
taught
to
the
children
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
and
sought
diligently
to
sanctify
his
people
that
they
might
behold
the
face
of
god
but
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
could
not
endure
his
presence
therefore
the
lord
in
his
wrath
for
his
anger
was
kindled
against
them
swore
that
they
should
not
enter
into
his
rest
while
in
the
wilderness
which
rest
is
the
fulness
of
his
glory
therefore
he
took
moses
out
of
their
midst
and
the
holy
priesthood
also
and
the
lesser
priesthood
continued
which
priesthood
holdeth
the
key
of
the
ministering
of
angels
and
the
preparatory
gospel
which
gospel
is
the
gospel
of
repentance
and
of
baptism
and
the
remission
of
sins
and
the
law
of
carnal
commandments
which
the
lord
in
his
wrath
caused
to
continue
with
the
house
of
aaron
among
the
children
of
israel
until
john
whom
god
raised
up
being
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
from
his
mother
womb
for
he
was
baptized
while
he
was
yet
in
his
childhood
and
was
ordained
by
the
angel
of
god
at
the
time
he
was
eight
days
old
unto
this
power
to
overthrow
the
kingdom
of
the
jews
and
to
make
straight
the
way
of
the
lord
before
the
face
of
his
people
to
prepare
them
for
the
coming
of
the
lord
in
whose
hand
is
given
all
sec
lxxxiv
it
was
this
same
gospel
that
the
crucified
redeemer
commanded
his
disciples
to
preach
when
he
said
unto
them
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
in
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
they
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
it
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay
hands
on
the
sick
and
they
shall
recover
mark
xvi
and
mark
testifies
they
went
forth
and
preached
every
where
the
lord
working
with
them
and
confirming
the
word
with
signs
following
hence
we
find
on
the
day
of
pentecost
peter
the
senior
of
the
apostles
in
answer
to
the
cry
of
the
believing
multitude
men
and
brethren
what
shall
we
do
replying
in
the
words
already
quoted
repent
and
be
baptized
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
for
the
promise
is
unto
you
and
your
children
and
to
all
that
are
afar
off
even
as
many
as
the
lord
our
god
shall
call
acts
ii
again
it
was
this
same
everlasting
unalterable
unchangeable
gospel
whose
restoration
to
the
earth
john
the
apostle
spoke
of
as
follows
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgment
is
come
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven
and
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
fountains
of
waters
revelation
xiv
from
the
bible
we
turn
to
the
book
of
mormon
and
in
its
pages
discover
that
the
same
gospel
which
jesus
directed
his
disciples
to
go
into
all
the
world
and
preach
was
preached
on
this
continent
from
the
earliest
ages
the
jaredites
became
acquainted
with
it
through
the
revelations
given
to
the
brother
of
jared
in
one
of
which
jesus
said
unto
him
behold
i
am
he
who
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
to
redeem
my
people
behold
i
am
jesus
christ
i
am
the
father
and
the
son
in
me
shall
all
mankind
have
light
and
that
eternally
even
they
who
shall
believe
on
my
name
and
they
shall
become
my
sons
and
my
daughters
ether
iii
and
he
ministered
unto
him
even
as
he
ministered
unto
the
nephites
ether
iii
the
principles
of
this
gospel
were
very
fully
understood
by
the
nephites
before
the
advent
of
the
messiah
we
quote
from
a
sermon
of
the
younger
alma
he
says
now
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
laid
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
there
could
have
been
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
but
there
was
a
plan
of
redemption
laid
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
of
which
has
been
spoken
and
now
behold
if
it
were
possible
that
our
first
parents
could
have
went
forth
and
partaken
of
the
tree
of
life
they
would
have
been
for
ever
miserable
having
no
preparatory
state
and
thus
the
plan
of
redemption
would
have
been
frustrated
and
the
word
of
god
would
have
been
void
taking
none
effect
but
behold
it
was
not
so
but
it
was
appointed
unto
man
that
they
must
die
and
after
death
they
must
come
to
judgment
even
that
same
judgment
of
which
we
have
spoken
which
is
the
end
and
after
god
had
appointed
that
these
things
should
come
unto
man
behold
then
he
saw
that
it
was
expedient
that
man
should
know
concerning
the
things
whereof
he
had
appointed
unto
them
therefore
he
sent
angels
to
converse
with
them
who
caused
men
to
behold
of
his
glory
alma
xii
it
will
be
seen
from
this
in
the
first
place
that
as
we
have
before
stated
god
plan
in
relation
to
man
was
that
he
should
fall
and
having
fallen
and
obtained
a
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
which
knowledge
he
could
not
have
obtained
without
placing
himself
in
that
position
then
it
became
necessary
that
he
should
know
concerning
the
atonement
and
redemption
which
should
be
brought
about
through
the
mediation
of
jesus
christ
and
hence
the
angel
communicated
as
before
related
this
knowledge
to
adam
and
alma
testimony
on
this
continent
is
found
to
agree
precisely
with
the
testimony
given
in
the
pearl
of
great
price
pertaining
to
the
revelation
of
god
will
through
an
angel
to
adam
we
again
quote
from
the
same
discourse
and
they
began
from
that
time
forth
to
call
on
his
name
therefore
god
conversed
with
men
and
made
known
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
which
had
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
this
he
made
known
unto
them
according
to
their
faith
and
repentance
and
their
holy
works
wherefore
he
gave
commandments
unto
men
they
having
first
transgressed
the
first
commandments
as
to
things
which
were
temporal
and
becoming
as
gods
knowing
good
from
evil
placing
themselves
in
a
state
to
act
or
being
placed
in
a
state
to
act
according
to
their
wills
and
pleasures
whether
to
do
evil
or
to
do
good
therefore
god
gave
unto
them
commandments
after
having
made
known
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
that
they
should
not
do
evil
the
penalty
thereof
being
a
second
death
which
was
an
everlasting
death
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
for
on
such
the
plan
of
redemption
could
have
no
power
for
the
works
of
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
according
to
the
supreme
goodness
of
god
but
god
did
call
on
men
in
the
name
of
his
son
this
being
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
laid
saying
if
ye
will
repent
and
harden
not
your
hearts
then
will
i
have
mercy
upon
you
through
mine
only
begotten
son
therefore
whosoever
repenteth
and
hardeneth
not
his
heart
he
shall
have
claim
on
mercy
through
mine
only
begotten
son
unto
a
remission
of
his
sins
and
these
shall
enter
into
my
rest
and
whosoever
will
harden
his
heart
and
will
do
iniquity
behold
i
swear
in
my
wrath
that
he
shall
not
enter
into
my
rest
alma
xii
when
jesus
himself
appeared
to
the
nephites
he
preached
the
same
identical
principles
that
he
had
previously
taught
to
the
jews
adding
occasionally
further
truths
because
of
the
greater
faith
of
the
first
named
people
and
he
did
expound
all
things
even
from
the
beginning
even
until
the
time
he
should
come
in
his
glory
amongst
other
things
he
said
whosoever
will
hearken
unto
my
words
and
repenteth
and
is
baptized
the
same
shall
be
saved
search
the
prophets
for
many
there
be
that
testify
of
these
things
nephi
xxiii
and
it
is
this
same
gospel
attended
by
the
same
power
and
spirit
blessed
by
the
same
inspiration
and
led
by
the
same
priesthood
that
is
now
being
preached
to
all
the
world
for
a
witness
through
its
principles
and
by
its
power
the
kingdom
of
god
will
be
established
righteousness
spread
evil
overcome
and
satan
be
vanquished
by
it
zion
and
the
new
jerusalem
will
be
built
up
enoch
and
his
city
be
received
the
work
of
the
millennium
be
done
the
renovation
of
the
earth
accomplished
and
all
god
glorious
will
be
fulfilled
until
the
vision
becomes
a
reality
which
daniel
saw
and
wrote
behold
one
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
and
there
was

appendix
the
ideas
of
a
general
atonement
and
redemption
entertained
by
ancient
heathen
nations
derived
originally
from
the
teachings
of
earlier
servants
of
god
the
following
are
some
natural
deductions
drawn
from
the
theories
entertained
by
men
and
recorded
in
history
which
tend
to
establish
rather
than
to
overturn
the
principles
which
are
so
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
foregoing
pages
exhibiting
and
showing
that
the
atonement
was
a
great
plan
of
the
almighty
for
the
salvation
redemption
and
exaltation
of
the
human
family
and
that
the
pretenders
in
the
various
ages
had
drawn
whatever
of
truth
they
possessed
from
a
knowledge
of
those
principles
taught
by
the
priesthood
from
the
earliest
periods
of
recorded
time
instead
of
christianity
being
indebted
as
some
late
writers
would
allege
to
the
turbid
systems
of
heathen
mythology
and
to
pagan
ceremonials
we
believe
in
the
foregoing
pages
it
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
to
all
saints
that
the
prophecy
and
promise
of
the
coming
of
the
son
of
god
was
fully
understood
in
every
dispensation
of
providence
from
the
earliest
period
of
the
world
history
down
through
the
succeeding
ages
everywhere
and
at
all
times
when
the
church
of
god
existed
on
the
earth
furthermore
that
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
as
understood
by
us
was
understood
in
like
manner
by
the
ancient
servants
of
the
lord
and
that
it
was
the
central
principle
of
their
faith
the
foundation
of
their
hope
for
eternal
felicity
and
salvation
and
their
only
trust
for
the
resurrection
of
their
bodies
and
life
everlasting
in
the
presence
of
the
father
again
that
the
ancient
patriarchs
seers
prophets
high
priests
and
others
were
almost
as
intimately
acquainted
with
the
earthly
life
and
ministry
of
the
savior
by
and
through
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
the
spirit
of
revelation
as
we
are
by
the
perusal
of
his
history
given
to
us
in
the
sacred
scriptures
these
worthies
of
olden
time
knew
where
he
would
be
born
and
the
names
that
would
be
given
to
him
that
his
mother
would
be
called
mary
and
be
a
virgin
of
the
tribe
of
judah
and
house
of
david
herod
massacre
of
the
innocents
and
the
flight
of
the
holy
family
into
egypt
were
not
hidden
from
them
they
spake
of
christ
baptism
by
john
in
jordan
and
of
the
divine
approval
that
would
follow
they
prophesied
of
his
ministry
rejoiced
in
his
wonderful
works
of
power
and
deeds
of
charity
and
love
they
understood
that
he
should
be
betrayed
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
they
mourned
at
the
vision
of
his
sufferings
and
death
and
rejoiced
at
his
triumph
and
resurrection
even
the
minor
details
of
the
soldiers
parting
his
raiment
among
them
his
death
between
two
malefactors
and
his
burial
in
the
rich
man
tomb
were
revealed
and
still
further
his
descent
into
hades
his
preaching
to
the
spirits
in
prison
his
visits
to
the
nephites
and
his
ultimate
ascension
to
the
father
were
all
comprehended
they
knew
that
he
would
triumph
over
death
hell
and
the
grave
be
crowned
with
glory
at
the
right
hand
of
the
majesty
on
high
and
that
all
power
would
be
given
to
him
in
heaven
and
on
earth
these
and
many
more
details
were
understood
prophesied
of
talked
about
and
rejoiced
in
by
the
priesthood
and
saints
from
the
days
of
adam
to
the
hour
that
they
began
to
be
fulfilled
by
his
advent
and
incarnation
it
is
needless
for
us
to
go
backward
to
the
days
before
the
flood
to
learn
to
what
extent
these
truths
were
understood
by
the
antediluvian
races
for
all
the
accounts
that
we
have
of
those
peoples
come
down
to
us
through
the
channel
of
the
holy
priesthood
and
all
the
records
books
traditions
of
those
early
inhabitants
of
our
globe
were
brought
to
the
children
of
the
renovated
earth
through
one
family
that
of
noah
and
that
patriarch
by
right
of
universal
fatherhood
to
the
new
generations
ruled
them
as
high
priest
patriarch
and
king
as
one
to
whom
the
living
god
revealed
his
mind
and
will
through
whom
the
keys
rights
and
powers
of
the
everlasting
priesthood
were
continued
upon
the
earth
and
with
whom
special
covenants
were
made
by
the
almighty
and
the
bow
set
in
the
clouds
as
an
everlasting
token
of
their
perpetuity
and
unchangeableness
it
will
be
perceived
that
in
the
first
days
after
the
flood
there
was
but
one
religion
and
that
was
the
worship
of
the
true
god
under
the
ministration
and
guidance
of
his
duly
authorized
servants
further
that
the
belief
of
the
first
inhabitants
of
the
postdiluvian
age
was
not
only
the
true
one
but
it
was
accompanied
by
the
power
and
authority
of
the
holy
priesthood
which
received
revelations
direct
from
the
almighty
thus
the
young
world
like
the
old
was
opened
with
a
dispensation
of
god
mercy
and
the
posterity
of
noah
were
not
left
to
grope
in
the
dark
for
light
and
truth
anymore
than
had
been
the
immediate
descendants
of
our
great
original
father
the
effects
of
thus
repeopling
the
earth
under
the
direct
and
immediate
guidance
of
jehovah
through
his
duly
appointed
servants
have
been
felt
through
all
succeeding
generations
for
men
as
they
scattered
over
the
earth
took
with
them
the
seeds
of
divine
truth
and
though
frequently
in
after
ages
they
disfigured
it
with
false
and
base
theories
of
their
own
introduced
all
manner
of
corruptions
into
their
forms
of
worship
established
orders
of
uninspired
and
unauthorized
priesthood
and
replaced
the
worship
of
the
true
god
by
idolatry
yet
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
god
the
universal
father
was
not
entirely
forgotten
nor
was
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
ever
utterly
obliterated
from
the
minds
of
men
so
strong
and
so
universal
a
hold
had
this
principle
in
the
varied
religions
of
antiquity
that
its
very
strength
has
been
used
as
an
argument
against
the
doctrine
and
it
has
been
vigorously
asserted
that
the
gospel
taught
by
the
savior
was
of
pagan
origin
and
that
he
was
simply
a
reformer
who
took
the
most
excellent
wisdom
of
past
ages
and
framed
it
into
a
code
of
morals
and
system
of
religious
faith
to
suit
his
own
ideas
and
accomplish
his
own
purposes
however
noble
those
purposes
might
have
been
the
earliest
departures
from
the
straight
and
narrow
path
to
the
lives
that
are
eternal
appear
to
have
been
made
in
chaldea
and
egypt
in
the
former
land
nimrod
was
one
of
the
first
leaders
in
apostacy
and
wickedness
a
these
evils
so
rapidly
spread
that
as
early
as
the
days
of
melchizedec
and
abraham
the
worship
of
false
deities
and
idols
seems
to
have
become
almost
universal
and
even
those
who
did
not
worship
graven
images
the
starry
hosts
of
heaven
or
the
forces
of
nature
had
so
far
perverted
the
principles
of
the
gospel
that
they
taught
numerous
soul
destroying
errors
totally
inconsistent
with
the
plan
devised
by
heaven
in
egypt
the
apostacy
began
and
an
unauthorized
priesthood
was
established
as
early
as
the
days
of
the
grandson
of
ham
the
origin
of
this
defection
is
explained
in
the
book
of
abraham

now
the
first
government
of
egypt
was
established
by
pharaoh
the
eldest
son
of
egyptus
the
daughter
of

and
it
was
after
the
manner
of
the
government
of

which
was
patriarchal
pharaoh
being
a
righteous
man
established
his

in

in

with

fain
claim
it
from

the
idolatries
of
chaldea

marked
tone
and
color
to
the
mythologies
of
the
dominant
races
of
antiquity
on
the
eastern
hemisphere
we
shall
not
trace
the
growth
and
development
of
the
religions
of
persia
greece
rome
through
their
various
branches
and
ramifications
such
an
effort
would
require
a
volume
but
we
shall
confine
ourselves
simply
to
a
brief
consideration
of
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
as
understood
by
the
ancient
gentile
nations
referring
only
to
such
other
theories
and
ideas
as
have
naturally
a
bearing
on
that
doctrine
as
a
starting
point
we
believe
we
may
state
with
assurance
of
its
truth
that
the
expectation
of
the
coming
of
a
son
of
god
a
messiah
in
the
flesh
was
universal
with
all
the
leading
nations
that
flourished
in
the
ages
previous
to
the
advent
of
the
redeemer
this
is
true
of
the
people
of
egypt
babylon
arabia
persia
hindostan
greece
and
rome
as
also
of
the
races
that
inhabited
the
american
continent
and
so
strong
in
certain
cases
had
this
idea
grown
that
by
gradual
stages
it
became
changed
into
the
belief
that
that
expected
son
of
god
had
already
come
and
such
a
being
was
reverenced
and
worshiped
under
various
names
in
greece
and
rome
this
idea
became
so
prevalent
that
nearly
every
very
eminent
man
was
thought
to
be
a
son
of
one
of
the
gods
and
evil
designing
men
sometimes
personated
these
deities
on
purpose
to
seduce
the
virtuous
of
the
other
sex
whose
chastity
they
could
overcome
in
no
other
way
than
by
falsely
declaring
themselves
to
be
the
god
for
whom
such
women
had
particular
reverence
and
esteem
a
whilst
on
the
other
hand
young
women
who
found
themselves
mothers
without
husbands
would
cunningly
declare
that
their
children
were
the
offspring
of
a
god
or
to
use
the
words
of
the
historian
grote
when
speaking
of
greece
the
furtive
pregnancy
of
young
women
often
by

one
of
the
most
frequently
recurring
incidents
in
the
legendary
narratives
of
the
country
to
such
an
extent
did
this
excess
run
that
at
a
later
period
a
decree
was
issued
subjecting
to
a
very
severe
penalty
any
woman
who
should
pretend
that
her
child
was
of
divine
parentage
one
writer
states
many
are
the
cases
noted
in
history
of
young
maidens
claiming
a
paternity
for
their
male
offspring
by
a
god
in
greece
it
became
so
common
that
the
reigning
king
issued
an
edict
decreeing
the
death
of
all
young
women
who
should
offer
such
an
insult
to
deity
as
to
lay
to
him
the
charge
of
begetting
their
children
whilst
on
this
point

immaculate
conceptions
and
celestial
descents
were
so
currently
received

days

had

distinguished
himself

was
thought
to
be

as

had
been
set
up
we
are
informed
a
that
those
who
were
initiated
into
the
inner

time
the
wisdom

the

of
god
the
incarnation
and
earthly
life
of
this
important
being
constituted
the
grand
mystery
of
their
entire
religious
system
so
great
was
their
faith
in
the
advent

this
holy
one

they
had
chambers
prepared
in

the
priesthood
of

egyptians
though
entirely
without
divine
authority
taught
many
great
truths
which
they
had
received
from
noah
through
ham
and
pharaoh
and
it
took
generations
before
these
gospel
truths
were
so
entirely
overlaid
and
corrupted
by
falsehood
and
pagan
innovations
that
they
became
undiscernable
to
all
but
the
initiated
it
is
an
important
fact
holding
good
of
other
ancient
civilizations
as
well
as
that
of
egypt
that
the
farther
we
trace
back
their
religious
beliefs
and
mythologies
the
purer
does
the
creed
become
the
nearer
it
approaches
to
heavenly
truth
and
the
stronger
and
more
evident
are
the
traces
of
gospel
teachings
this
fact
alone
is
sufficient
to
prove
that
paganism
had
its
origin
in
the
revelations
of
heaven
from
which
in
its
various
diverse
branches
it
had
turned
and
strayed
and
by
gradual
growth
had
become
the
vile
inconsistent
degrading
and
loathsome
system
which
is
abhorred
by
all
pure
minded
honorable
and
intelligent
people
had
the
various
forms
of
ancient
dominant
pagan
worship
been
radically
and
entirely
different
with
only
those
features
in
common
that
could
reasonably
be
attributed
to
accident
or
the
of
races
the
inference
would
be
strong
that
they
had
different
origins
but
when
as
is
the
case
there
is
a
strong
family
likeness
and
that
likeness
grows
stronger
the
further
it
is
traced
back
and
continually
points
to
a
common
parentage
and
that
parentage
is
the
truth
as
taught
by
the
early
patriarchs
and
inspired
servants
of
heaven
our
conclusions
must
necessarily
be
that
these
correct
and
teachings
were
the
source
from
whence
the
whole
sprang
and
the
differences
in
development
arose
from
the
varied
incidents
in
the
history
and
the
peculiar
surroundings
of
the
various

that
gave

that
the

satan
led
men
from
the
right
path
and
under
the
influences
of
a
false
or
diabolic
inspiration
many
errors
were
introduced
as
well
as
through
the
natural
corrupt
ambition
of
men
who
sought
to
obtain
power
over
their
fellows
by
promulgating
new
theories
in
the
name
of
god
and
under
the
auspices
of
religion
the
ologies
of
would
have
been
impossible
in
the
days
of
pharaoh
and
nimrod
the
style
of
apostacy
was
necessarily
fashioned
by
the
condition
of
men
minds
their
advance
in
civilization
and
their
understanding
of
physical
laws
in
the
rudimentary
condition
of
the
nations
who
scattered
at
babel
the
easiest
thing
for
them
to
do
was
to
worship
their
dead
ancestors
and
the
heavenly
orbs
in
due
course
naturally
followed
the
framing
of
idols
which
at
first
only
represented
the
being
or
thing
worshiped
but
which
were
afterwards
regarded
as
gods
themselves
and
as
such
reverenced
the
idea
of
god
anger
at
men
sins
associated
with
the
law
of
sacrifice
led
mankind
to
believe
that
the
more
precious
and
beloved
was
the
offering
to
him
who
offered
it
the
more
acceptable
would
it
be
to
heaven
as
a
result
men
soon
began
to
offer
up
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
appease
the
wrath
of
their
gods
abraham
informs
us
now
at
this
time
it
was
the
custom
of
the
priest
of
pharaoh
the
king
of
egypt
to
offer
up
upon
the
altar
which
was
built
in
the
land
of
chaldea
for
the
offering
unto
these
strange
gods
men
women
and
children
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
priest
made
an
offering
unto
the
god
of
pharaoh
and
also
unto
the
god
of
shagreel
even
after
the
manner
of
the
egyptians
now
the
god
of
shagreel
was
the
sun
even
the
of
a
child
did
the
priest
of
pharaoh
offer
upon
the
altar
which
stood
by
the
hill
called
potiphar
hill
at
the
head
of
the
plain
of
olishem
now
this
priest
had
offered
upon
this
altar
three
virgins
at
one
time
who
were
the
daughters
of
onitah
one
of
the
royal
descent
directly
from
the
loins
of
ham
these
virgins
were
offered
up
because
of
their
virtue
they
would
not
bow
down
to
worship
gods
of
wood
or
of
stone
therefore
they
were
killed
upon
this
altar
and
it
was
done
after
the
manner
of
the
egyptians
book
of
abraham
this
practice
of
offering
human
sacrifices
had
become
very
general
on
the
eastern
continent
in
abraham
day
one
peculiar
phase
of
false
doctrine
with
regard
to
the
atonement
had
grown
strong
in
the
days
of
this
patriarch
it
was
that
the
blood
of
the
righteous
abel
was
shed
for
sins
a
this
was
a
very
natural
mental
outgrowth
among
people
who
believed
in
the
consequences
of
the
fall
of
adam
and
had
been
taught
the
necessity
of
a
redeemer
it
was
a
very
easy
thing
to
fall
into
the
error
that
as
adam
had
transgressed
so
his
immediate
son
atoned
by
his
blood
for
his
father
act
and
in
the
spread
of
this
incorrect
idea
of
abel
atonement
amongst
the
early
peoples
may
be
found
the
origin
of
the
many
diversified
legends
of
a
sacrificed
redeemer
this
theory
was
taught
at
a
day
so
early
in
the
world
history
that
it
spread
with
the
migrating
races
in
every
direction
so
that
traces
of
it
can
be
found
from
hindostan
to
spain
from
the
baltic
to
ethiopia
of
course
every
people
in
their
own
language
had
their
peculiar
name
for
this
savior
and
each
race
claimed
him
as
theirs
as
abel
certainly
belonged
as
much
to
one
as
the
other
having
no
posterity
and
by
degrees
they
wove
many
fanciful
and
mythical
legends
round
his
life
and
death
varying
according
to
the
tastes
imaginative
power
and
environment
of
the
different
races
this
to
a
very
great
extent
explains
that
enigma
to
christians
who
believe
that
gospel
truths
were
first
taught
by
jesus
when
in
the
flesh
how
the
knowledge
of
the
principle
of
the
atonement
and
the
tradition
of
a
savior
was
so
wide
spread
throughout
the
world
before
his
actual
coming
footnote
a
inspired
translation
of
genesis
xvii
there
is
another
way
by
which
the
knowledge
of
these
truths
was
taught
we
refer
to
the
extended
preaching
of
such
worthies
as
melchizedec
abraham
jethro
job
jeremiah
jonah
and
others
and
above
all
to
that
of
the
apostles
after
the
redeemer
death
dispensation
succeeded
dispensation
as
age
succeeded
age
time
and
time
again
the
people
apostatized
but
each
time
some
little
remnant
of
divine
truth
remained
with
them
jesus
christ
was
preached
by
name
soon
after
the
creation
as
cyrus
was
named
by
divine
revelation
about
two
hundred
years
before
his
birth
thus
in
some
languages
we
have
accounts
of
great
men
of
god
or
gods
as
the
case
may
be
whose
acts
are
said
to
have
been
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
counterpart
of
those
of
the
messiah
when
he
tabernacled
in
the
flesh
and
whose
names
bear
a
most
remarkable
likeness
to
that
of
the
son
of
god
hence
we
have
checsna
or
chrishna
of
hindostan
and
hesus
of
the
druids
both
of
which
names
bear
a
marked
similarity
to
those
of
the
redeemer
the
first
to
christ
the
second
to
jesus
it
appears
altogether
probable
that
the
histories
of
these
men
are
simply
the
shadowy
traditions
of
the
savior
the
faint
recollection
of
the
teachings
of
inspired
men
which
were
localized
to
suit
sectional
vanity
or
pride
of
race
or
that
some
ancient
teacher
of
their
own
peoples
has
been
clothed
with
the
attributes
and
works
of
christ
and
during
the
lapse
of
ages
the
acts
and
deeds
of
the
two
lives
have
been
intermingled
in
one
until
at
this
day
a
rightful
separation
is
impossible
this
habit
of
mixing
and
mingling
the
great
deeds
of
several
distinct
persons
and
forming
therefrom
one
grand
if
not
altogether
harmonious
whole
is
one
well
understood
by
those
who
have
studied
the
traditions
of
mankind
it
is
not
peculiar
to
any
age
or
race
and
even
in
our
day
we
often
find
a
certain
anecdote
whether
real
or
imaginary
told
of
various
celebrities
some
of
whom
may
be
yet
living
while
others
are
among
the
recent
dead
the
effects
of
this
habit
when
continued
through
long
ages
amongst
or
barbarous
nations
went
far
to
fashion
the
history
of
their
gods
and
often
to
manufacture
deities
out
of
altogether
imaginary
personages
modern
revelation
has
restored
another
most
important
key
to
unlock
the
mystery
of
the
almost
universal
knowledge
of
the
redeemer
and
of
the
plan
of
the
atonement
it
is
found
in
the
statement
that
jesus
after
his
resurrection
visited
at
least
the
inhabitants
of
two
distinct
portions
of
the
earth
which
could
not
have
been
reached
through
the
ministry
of
his
jewish
apostles
these
two
peoples
were
the
nephites
on
this
land
and
the
ten
tribes
in
their
distant
northern
home
the
knowledge
that
the
mexicans
and
other
aboriginal
races
of
america
had
at
the
time
of
their
discovery
by
the
spaniards
of
the
life
of
the
savior
was
so
exact
that
the
catholics
suggested
two
theories
both
incorrect
however
to
solve
the
mystery
one
was
that
the
devil
had
invented
an
imitation
gospel
to
delude
the
indians
the
other
that
the
apostle
thomas
had
visited
america
and
taught
its
people
the
plan
of
salvation
the
story
of
the
life
of
the
mexican
divinity
quetzalcoatl
closely
resembles
that
of
the
savior
so
closely
indeed
that
we
can
come
to
no
other
conclusion
than
that
quetzalcoatl
and
christ
are
the
same
being
but
the
history
of
the
former
has
been
handed
down
to
us
through
an
impure
lamanitish
source
which
has
sadly
disfigured
and
perverted
the
original
incidents
and
teachings
of
the
savior
life
and
ministry
regarding
this
god
humboldt
writes
how
truly
surprising
is
it
to
find
that
the
mexicans
who
seem
to
have
been
unacquainted
with
the
doctrine
of
the
migration
of
the
soul
and
the
metempsychosis
have
believed
in
the
incarnation
of
the
only
son
of
the
supreme
god
for
mexican
mythology
speaking
of
no
other
son
of
god
except
quetzalcoatl
who
was
born
of
chimelman
the
virgin
of
tula
without
man
by
his
breath
alone
by
which
may
be
signified
his
word
or
will
when
it
was
announced
to
chimelman
by
the
celestial
messenger
whom
he
dispatched
to
inform
her
that
she
should
conceive
a
son
it
must
be
presumed
this
was
quetzalcoatl
who
was
the
only
son
other
authors
might
be
adduced
to
show
that
the
mexicans
believe
that
this
quetzalcoatl
was
both
god
and
man
that
he
had
previously
to
his
incarnation
existed
from
eternity
and
that
he
had
been
the
creator
both
of
the
world
and
man
and
that
he
had
descended
to
reform
the
world
by
endurance
and
being
king
of
tula
was
crucified
for
the
sins
of
mankind
as
is
plainly
declared
in
the
tradition
of
yucatan
and
mysteriously
represented
in
the
mexican
paintings
the
following
brief
extracts
relating
to
quetzalcoatl
are
from
lord
kingsborough
antiquities
of
mexico
speaking
of
a
certain
plate
he
observes
quetzalcoatl
is
there
painted
in
the
attitude
of
a
person
crucified
with
the
impression
of
nails
in
his
hands
and
feet
but
not
actually
upon
the
cross
again
the
plate
of
the
borgian
is
the
most
remarkable
of
all
for
quetzalcoatl
is
not
only
represented
there
as
crucified
upon
a
cross
of
greek
form
but
his
burial
and
descent
into
hell
are
also
depicted
in
a
very
curious
manner
in
another
place
he
observes
the
mexicans
believe
that
quetzalcoatl
took
human
nature
upon
him
partaking
of
all
the
infirmities
of
man
and
was
not
exempt
from
sorrow
pain
or
death
which
he
suffered
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
rosales
in
his
history
when
speaking
of
the
people
of
the
extreme
southern
portion
of
america
states
they
had
heard
their
fathers
say
a
wonderful
man
had
come
to
that
country
who
performed
many
miracles
cured
the
sick
with
water
caused
it
to
rain
that
their
crops
of
grain
might
grow
kindled
fire
at
a
breath
healing
the
sick
and
giving
sight
to
the
blind
and
that
he
spoke
with
as
much
propriety
and
elegance
in
the
language
of
their
country
as
if
he
had
always
resided
in
it
addressing
them
in
words
very
sweet
and
new
to
them
telling
them
that
the
creator
of
the
universe
resided
in
the
highest
place
of
heaven
and
that
many
men
and
women
resplendent
as
the
sun
dwelt
with
him
thus
we
see
that
in
the
tradition
with
regard
to
this
especial
god
we
have
an
almost
complete
life
of
the
savior
from
the
announcement
of
his
birth
to
his
virgin
mother
by
an
angel
to
his
resurrection
from
the
grave
had
we
space
other
extracts
could
be
given
showing
that
there
were
many
details
not
above
mentioned
ascribed
to
quetzalcoatl
that
relate
to
incidents
in
the
life
of
christ
the
book
of
mormon
alone
explains
the
mystery
the
account
there
given
of
christ
ministrations
amongst
the
forefathers
of
these
peoples
makes
the
whole
thing
plain
we
understand
through
that
record
how
and
by
what
means
they
obtained
this
great
knowledge
and
can
also
readily
perceive
how
the
unworthy
descendants
of
those
whom
the
savior
visited
gradually
added
much
childish
rubbish
to
the
original
facts
making
their
story
like
almost
all
other
mythology
an
unseemly
compound
of
heavenly
truth
and
puerile
fable
but
in
view
of
these
facts
when
all
things
are
considered
it
is
almost
a
wonder
that
so
much
of
the
truth
was
retained
to
the
days
when
america
became
known
to
europeans
we
find
in
the
mythology
of
the
northmen
certain
traditions
that
lead
us
to
imagine
that
it
is
possible
that
the
visit
of
the
savior
to
the
ten
tribes
was
by
some
means
communicated
to
them
but
this
is
simply
a
conjecture
however
it
is
asserted
that
they
claimed
that
woden
one
of
their
principal
deities
was
a
descendant
of
king
david
a
very
curious
circumstance
that
it
is
difficult
to
explain
only
on
the
supposition
of
christ
visit
and
that
woden
with
them
occupied
the
place
that
quetzalcoatl
did
with
the
mexicans
there
is
yet
another
source
from
which
the
ancients
obtained
their
ideas
of
the
life
and
mission
of
the
son
of
god
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
translation
of
enoch
and
his
city
the
fact
of
enoch
translation
was
generally
known
by
the
people
who
lived
immediately
after
the
flood
it
had
occurred
so
short
a
time
before
that
it
was
almost
a
matter
of
personal
recollection
with
the
sons
of
noah
they
must
also
have
been
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
others
were
caught
up
by
the
power
of
heaven
into
zion
and
it
would
appear
strongly
probable
that
melchizedec
and
many
of
his
people
were
also
translated
revelation
does
not
state
this
in
so
many
words
but
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
what
is
said
points
clearly
in
that
direction
the
fact
of
these
translations
the
frequent
visits
of
angels
to
men
holding
the
priesthood
and
the
manifestation
of
god
power
over
the
elements
of
nature
made
manifest
through
his
servants
laid
a
foundation
for
many
of
the
fables
of
ancient
mythology
some
of
which
if
we
were
to
change
the
names
and
localities
to
those
of
bible
history
would
not
be
as
far
from
the
truth
as
many
suppose
this
era
of
with
the
holy
beings
of
the
other
world
was
easily
magnified
and
distorted
into
the
golden
age
when
gods
dwelt
with
men
associated
with
much
of
earth
life
and
were
swayed
by
passions
very
much
as
were
their
mortal
companions
and
as
before
remarked
the
simplicity
of
these
traditions
was
greatly
changed
as
the
ages
rolled
around
until
they
were
completely
overlaid
and
hidden
by
abominable
and
monstrous
fables
invented
taught
and
used
by
the
priests
and
their
associates
for
their
own
sinister
and
unholy
purposes
from
the
whole
of
these
statements
we
gather
that
while
men
who
have
written
in
relation
to
the
various
gods
or
virgins
who
have
each
in
her
turn
conceived
and
borne
a
god
or
a
messiah
would
argue
that
the
accounts
of
the
birth
ministry
death
resurrection
of
the
savior
were
simply
a
backing
up
and
resuscitating
of
some
of
the
old
legends
of
heathen
mythology
which
had
been
in
existence
in
ages
long
antecedent
to
his
advent
and
that
therefore
the
account
of
the
life
and
works
of
the
redeemer
was
simply
an
act
of
priestcraft
to
introduce
another
messiah
and
another
establishment
of
religion
in
the
interests
of
the
projectors
and
that
christianity
was
simply
a
copy
of
the
old
paganisms
that
had
exhibited
themselves
in
the
forms
above
referred
to
whereas
the
reverse
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
foregoing
chapters
on
the
atonement
the
fact
is
clearly
proved
instead
of
christianity
deriving
its
existence
and
facts
from
the
ideas
and
practices
of
heathen
mythologists
and
from
the
various
false
systems
that
had
been
introduced
by
apostacy
unrecognized
pretensions
and
fraud
that
those
very
systems
themselves
were
obtained
from
the
true
priesthood
and
founded
on
its
teachings
from
the
earliest
ages
to
the
advent
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
that
those
holy
principles
were
taught
to
adam
and
by
him
to
his
posterity
that
enoch
noah
abraham
and
the
various
prophets
had
all
borne
testimony
of
this
grand
and
important
event
wherein
the
interest
and
happiness
of
the
whole
world
were
concerned
pertaining
to
time
and
to
eternity
the
gospel
is
a
system
great
grand
and
comprehensive
commencing
in
eternity
extending
through
all
time
and
then
reaching
into
the
eternities
to
come
and
the
ideas
with
regard
to
these
disjointed
materials
that
are
gathered
together
from
the
turbid
waters
of
heathen
mythology
are
so
much
clap
trap
and
nonsense
calculated
only
to
deceive
the
unwary
superstitious
and
ignorant
and
are
as
far
below
those
great
and
eternal
principles
