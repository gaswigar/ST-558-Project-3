preface
an
attempt
is
made
in
the
pages
of
this
book
to
write
of
theosophy
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
understood
by
the
ordinary
reader
bold
statements
are
made
in
it
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
writer
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
distinctly
to
be
understood
that
he
alone
is
responsible
for
what
is
therein
written
the
theosophical
society
is
not
involved
in
nor
bound
by
anything
said
in
the
book
nor
are
any
of
its
members
any
the
less
good
theosophists
because
they
may
not
accept
what
he
has
set
down
the
tone
of
settled
conviction
which
may
be
thought
to
pervade
the
chapters
is
not
the
result
of
dogmatism
or
conceit
but
flows
from
knowledge
based
upon
evidence
and
experience
members
of
the
theosophical
society
will
notice
that
certain
theories
or
doctrines
have
not
been
gone
into
that
is
because
they
could
not
be
treated
without
unduly
extending
the
book
and
arousing
needless
controversy
the
subject
of
the
will
has
received
no
treatment
inasmuch
as
that
power
or
faculty
is
hidden
subtle
undiscoverable
as
to
essence
and
only
visible
in
effect
as
it
is
absolutely
colorless
and
varies
in
moral
quality
in
accordance
with
the
desire
behind
it
as
also
it
acts
frequently
without
our
knowledge
and
as
it
operates
in
all
the
kingdoms
below
man
there
could
be
nothing
gained
by
attempting
to
enquire
into
it
apart
from
the
spirit
and
the
desire
no
originality
is
claimed
for
this
book
the
writer
invented
none
of
it
discovered
none
of
it
but
has
simply
written
that
which
he
has
been
taught
and
which
has
been
proved
to
him
it
therefore
is
only
a
handing
on
of
what
has
been
known
before
william

judge
preface
to
new
edition
some
years
ago
the
first
edition
of
the
ocean
of
theosophy
was
published
by
its
author
wm
q
judge
since
that
time
thousands
of
books
dealing
with
theosophy
have
been
published
by
more
or
less
prominent
students
of
theosophy
but
unfortunately
for
the
public
none
of
these
show
the
knowledge
grasp
and
range
which
is
so
evident
in
the
present
volume
still
more
unfortunately
the
methods
pursued
by
these
writers
have
served
to
obscure
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
an
exposition
of
theosophy
written
by
a
teacher
of
that
science
of
life
as
the
author
s
preface
shows
the
book
was
written
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
understood
by
the
ordinary
reader
the
simplicity
of
the
terms
used
however
should
not
mislead
the
reader
into
thinking
that
the
work
is
an
elementary
one
for
behind
and
within
every
statement
there
is
a
depth
of
meaning
that
the
careless
and
superficial
fail
to
perceive
it
is
really
a
simplified
of
the
fundamental
teachings
of
theosophy
and
is
found
by
students
of
the
secret
doctrine
to
be
a
true
abridgment
of
that
great
work
and
a
wonderful
aid
in
its
comprehension
it
was
written
with
that
end
in
view
by
the
only
one
competent
to
do
so
and
is
therefore
earnestly
recommended
to
every
student
of
theosophy
the
passage
of
years
has
served
to
show
not
only
the
value
of
this
little
book
but
the
status
of
judge
as
a
teacher
everything
he
has
written
bears
impress
of
his
deep
knowledge
to
every
real
student
of
theosophy
even
the
ordinary
reader
can
not
fail
to
perceive
that
only
one
who
knows
could
have
so
applied
theosophy
to
the
circumstances
and
conditions
of
human
existence
there
are
but
few
books
whose
issuance
is
due
to
judge
these
few
however
are
most
valuable
aids
to
the
student
in
living
the
theosophic
life
letters
that
have
helped
me
are
two
small
volumes
containing
letters
written
to
students
with
comments
by
the
compiler
echoes
from
the
orient
is
a
broad
outline
of
theosophical
doctrines
pages

a
rendition
much
better
and
clearer
than
any
literal
translation
extant
patanjali
s
yoga
aphorisms
is
an
ancient
treatise
on
the
soul
and
its
powers
from
which
modern
psychology
has
much
to
learn
in
addition
judge
wrote
a
great
number
of
articles
dealing
with
the
philosophy
in
its
practical
application
to
daily
life
these
can
be
found
in
the
magazine
the
earnest
student
will
do
well
to
study
conjointly
the
writings
of
blavatsky
and
wm
q
judge
from
them
he
will
learn
theosophy
pure
and
simple
will
recognize
the
community
of
knowledge
and
complete
accord
that
existed
between
them
and
will
more
fully
appreciate
the
mission
and
nature
of
those

have
had

names
in

apollonius
moses
solomon

others
were
members
of
this
fraternity
they
had

the
ocean
of
theosophy
chapter
theosophy
is
that
ocean
of
knowledge
which
spreads
from
shore
to
shore
of
the
evolution
of
sentient
beings
unfathomable
in
its
deepest
parts
it
gives
the
greatest
minds
their
fullest
scope
yet
shallow
enough
at
its
shores
it
will
not
overwhelm
the
understanding
of
a
child
it
is
wisdom
about
god
for
those
who
believe
that
he
is
all
things
and
in
all
and
wisdom
about
nature
for
the
man
who
accepts
the
statement
found
in
the
christian
bible
that
god
can
not
be
measured
or
discovered
and
that
darkness
is
around
his
pavilion
although
it
contains
by
derivation
the
name
god
and
thus
may
seem
at
first
sight
to
embrace
religion
alone
it
does
not
neglect
science
for
it
is
the
science
of
sciences
and
therefore
has
been
called
the
wisdom
religion
for
no
science
is
complete
which
leaves
out
any
department
of
nature
whether
visible
or
invisible
and
that
religion
which
depending
solely
on
an
assumed
revelation
turns
away
from
things
and
the
laws
which
govern
them
is
nothing
but
a
delusion
a
foe
to
progress
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
man
s
advancement
toward
happiness
embracing
both
the
scientific
and
the
religious
theosophy
is
a
scientific
religion
and
a
religious
science
it
is
not
a
belief
or
dogma
formulated
or
invented
by
man
but
is
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
which
govern
the
evolution
of
the
physical
astral
psychical
and
intellectual
constituents
of
nature
and
of
man
the
religion
of
the
day
is
but
a
series
of
dogmas
and
with
no
scientific
foundation
for
promulgated
ethics
while
our
science
as
yet
ignores
the
unseen
and
failing
to
admit
the
existence
of
a
complete
set
of
inner
faculties
of
perception
in
man
it
is
cut
off
from
the
immense
and
real
field
of
experience
which
lies
within
the
visible
and
tangible
worlds
but
theosophy
knows
that
the
whole
is
constituted
of
the
visible
and
the
invisible
and
perceiving
outer
things
and
objects
to
be
but
transitory
it
grasps
the
facts
of
nature
both
without
and
within
it
is
therefore
complete
in
itself
and
sees
no
unsolvable
mystery
anywhere
it
throws
the
word
coincidence
out
of
its
vocabulary
and
hails
the
reign
of
law
in
everything
and
every
circumstance
that
man
possesses
an
immortal
soul
is
the
common
belief
of
humanity
to
this
theosophy
adds
that
he
is
a
soul
and
further
that
all
nature
is
sentient
that
the
vast
array
of
objects
and
men
are
not
mere
collections
of
atoms
fortuitously
thrown
together
and
thus
without
law
evolving
law
but
down
to
the
smallest
atom
all
is
soul
and
spirit
ever
evolving
under
the
rule
of
law
which
is
inherent
in
the
whole
and
just
as
the
ancients
taught
so
does
theosophy
that
the
course
of
evolution
is
the
drama
of
the
soul
and
that
nature
exists
for
no
other
purpose
than
the
soul
s
experience
the
theosophist
agrees
with
huxley
in
the
assertion
that
there
must
be
beings
in
the
universe
whose
intelligence
is
as
much
beyond
ours
as
ours
exceeds
that
of
the
black
beetle
and
who
take
an
active
part
in
the
government
of
the
natural
order
of
things
pushing
further
on
by
the
light
of
the
confidence
had
in
his
teachers
the
theosophist
adds
that
such
intelligences
were
once
human
and
came
like
all
of
us
from
other
and
previous
worlds
where
as
varied
experience
had
been
gained
as
is
possible
on
this
one
we
are
therefore
not
appearing
for
the
first
time
when
we
come
upon
this
planet
but
have
pursued
a
long
an
immeasurable
course
of
activity
and
intelligent
perception
on
other
systems
of
globes
some
of
which
were
destroyed
ages
before
the
solar
system
condensed
this
immense
reach
of
the
evolutionary
system
means
then
that
this
planet
on
which
we
now
are
is
the
result
of
the
activity
and
the
evolution
of
some
other
one
that
died
long
ago
leaving
its
energy
to
be
used
in
the
bringing
into
existence
of
the
earth
and
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
latter
in
their
turn
came
from
some
older
world
to
proceed
here
with
the
destined
work
in
matter
and
the
brighter
planets
such
as
venus
are
the
habitation
of
still
more
progressed
entities
once
as
low
as
ourselves
but
now
raised
up
to
a
pitch
of
glory
incomprehensible
for
our
intellects
the
most
intelligent
being
in
the
universe
man
has
never
then
been
without
a
friend
but
has
a
line
of
elder
brothers
who
continually
watch
over
the
progress
of
the
less
progressed
preserve
the
knowledge
gained
through
aeons
of
trial
and
experience
and
continually
seek
for
opportunities
of
drawing
the
developing
intelligence
of
the
race
on
this
or
other
globes
to
consider
the
great
truths
concerning
the
destiny
of
the
soul
these
elder
brothers
also
keep
the
knowledge
they
have
gained
of
the
laws
of
nature
in
all
departments
and
are
ready
when
cyclic
law
permits
to
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
they
have
always
existed
as
a
body
all
knowing
each
other
no
matter
in
what
part
of
the
world
they
may
be
and
all
working
for
the
race
in
many
different
ways
in
some
periods
they
are
well
known
to
the
people
and
move
among
ordinary
men
whenever
the
social
organization
the
virtue
and
the
development
of
the
nations
permit
it
for
if
they
were
to
come
out
openly
and
be
heard
of
everywhere
they
would
be
worshipped
as
gods
by
some
and
hunted
as
devils
by
others
in
those
periods
when
they
do
come
out
some
of
their
number
are
rulers
of
men
some
teachers
a
few
great
philosophers
while
others
remain
still
unknown
except
to
the
most
advanced
of
the
body
it
would
be
subversive
of
the
ends
they
have
in
view
were
they
to
make
themselves
public
in
the
present
civilization
which
is
based
almost
wholly
on
money
fame
glory
and
personality
for
this
age
as
one
of
them
has
already
said
is
an
age
of
transition
when
every
system
of
thought
science
religion
government
and
society
is
changing
and
men
s
minds
are
only
preparing
for
an
alteration
into
that
state
which
will
permit
the
race
to
advance
to
the
point
suitable
for
these
elder
brothers
to
introduce
their
actual
presence
to
our
sight
they
may
be
truly
called
the
bearers
of
the
torch
of
truth
across
the
ages
they
investigate
all
things
and
beings
they
know
what
man
is
in
his
innermost
nature
and
what
his
powers
and
destiny
his
state
before
birth
and
the
states
into
which
he
goes
after
the
death
of
his
body
they
have
stood
by
the
cradle
of
nations
and
seen
the
vast
achievements
of
the
ancients
watched
sadly
the
decay
of
those
who
had
no
power
to
resist
the
cyclic
law
of
rise
and
fall
and
while
cataclysms
seemed
to
show
a
universal
destruction
of
art
architecture
religion
and
philosophy
they
have
preserved
the
records
of
it
all
in
places
secure
from
the
ravages
of
either
men
or
time
they
have
made
minute
observations
through
trained
psychics
among
their
own
order
into
the
unseen
realms
of
nature
and
of
mind
recorded
the
observations
and
preserved
the
record
they
have
mastered
the
mysteries
of
sound
and
color
through
which
alone
the
elemental
beings
behind
the
veil
of
matter
can
be
communicated
with
and
thus
can
tell
why
the
rain
falls
and
what
it
falls
for
whether
the
earth
is
hollow
or
not
what
makes
the
wind
to
blow
and
light
to
shine
and
greater
feat
than
which
implies
a
knowledge
of
the
very
foundations
of
know
what
the
ultimate
divisions
of
time
are
and
what
are
the
meaning
and
the
times
of
the
cycles
but
asks
the
busy
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
reads
the
newspapers
and
believes
in
modern
progress
if
these
elder
brothers
are
all
you
claim
them
to
be
why
have
they
left
no
mark
on
history
nor
gathered
men
around
them
their
own
reply
published
some
time
ago
by
sinnett
is
better
than
any
i
could
write
we
will
first
discuss
if
you
please
the
one
relating
to
the
presumed
failure
of
the
fraternity
to
leave
any
mark
upon
the
history
of
the
world
they
ought
you
think
to
have
been
able
with
their
extraordinary
advantages
to
have
gathered
into
their
schools
a
considerable
portion
of
the
more
enlightened
minds
of
every
race
how
do
you
know
they
have
made
no
such
mark
are
you
acquainted
with
their
efforts
successes
and
failures
have
you
any
dock
upon
which
to
arraign
them
how
could
your
world
collect
proofs
of
the
doings
of
men
who
have
sedulously
kept
closed
every
possible
door
of
approach
by
which
the
inquisitive
could
spy
upon
them
the
precise
condition
of
their
success
was
that
they
should
never
be
supervised
or
obstructed
what
they
have
done
they
know
all
that
those
outside
their
circle
could
perceive
was
the
results
the
causes
of
which
were
masked
from
view
to
account
for
these
results
many
have
in
different
ages
invented
theories
of
the
interposition
of
gods
special
providences
fates
the
benign
or
hostile
influences
of
the
stars
there
never
was
a
time
within
or
before
the
historical
period
when
our
predecessors
were
not
moulding
events
and
making
history
the
facts
of
which
were
subsequently
and
invariably
distorted
by
historians
to
suit
contemporary
prejudices
are
you
quite
sure
that
the
visible
heroic
figures
in
the
successive
dramas
were
not
often
but
their
puppets
we
never
pretended
to
be
able
to
draw
nations
in
the
mass
to
this
or
that
crisis
in
spite
of
the
general
drift
of
the
world
s
cosmic
relations
the
cycles
must
run
their
rounds
periods
of
mental
and
moral
light
and
darkness
succeed
each
other
as
day
does
night
the
major
and
minor
yugas
must
be
accomplished
according
to
the
established
order
of
things
and
we
borne
along
the
mighty
tide
can
only
modify
and
direct
some
of
its
minor
it
is
under
cyclic
law
during
a
dark
period
in
the
history
of
mind
that
the
true
philosophy
disappears
for
a
time
but
the
same
law
causes
it
to
reappear
as
surely
as
the
sun
rises
and
the
human
mind
is
present
to
see
it
but
some
works
can
only
be
performed
by
the
master
while
other
works
require
the
assistance
of
the
companions
it
is
the
master
s
work
to
preserve
the
true
philosophy
but
the
help
of
the
companions
is
needed
to
rediscover
and
promulgate
it
once
more
the
elder
brothers
have
indicated
where
the
be
found
and
the
companions
all
over
the
world
are
engaged
in
bringing
it
forth
for
wider
currency
and
propagation
the
elder
brothers
of
humanity
are
men
who
were
perfected
in
former
periods
of
evolution
these
periods
of
manifestation
are
unknown
to
modern
evolutionists
so
far
as
their
number
are
concerned
though
long
ago
understood
by
not
only
the
older
hindus
but
also
by
those
great
minds
and
men
who
instituted
and
carried
on
the
first
pure
and
undebased
form
of
the
mysteries
of
greece
the
periods
when
out
of
the
great
unknown
there
come
forth
the
visible
universes
are
eternal
in
their
coming
and
going
alternating
with
equal
periods
of
silence
and
rest
again
in
the
unknown
the
object
of
these
mighty
waves
is
the
production
of
perfect
man
the
evolution
of
soul
and
they
always
witness
the
increase
of
the
number
of
elder
brothers
the
life
of
the
least
of
men
pictures
them
in
day
and
night
waking
and
sleeping
birth
and
death
for
these
two
light
and
dark
day
and
night
are
the
world
s
eternal
in
every
age
and
complete
national
history
these
men
of
power
and
compassion
are
given
different
designations
they
have
been
called
initiates
adepts
magi
hierophants
kings
of
the
east
wise
men
brothers
and
what
not
but
in
the
sanscrit
language
there
is
a
word
which
being
applied
to
them
at
once
thoroughly
identifies
them
with
humanity
it
is
mahatma
this
is
composed
of
great
and
soul
so
it
means
great
soul
and
as
all
men
are
souls
the
distinction
of
the
mahatma
lies
in
greatness
the
term
mahatma
has
come
into
wide
use
through
the
theosophical
society
as
mme
blavatsky
constantly
referred
to
them
as
her
masters
who
gave
her
the
knowledge
she
possessed
they
were
at
first
known
only
as
the
brothers
but
afterwards
when
many
hindus
flocked
to
the
theosophical
movement
the
name
mahatma
was
brought
into
use
inasmuch
as
it
has
behind
it
an
immense
body
of
indian
tradition
and
literature
at
different
times
unscrupulous
enemies
of
the
theosophical
society
have
said
that
even
this
name
had
been
invented
and
that
such
beings
are
not
known
of
among
the
indians
or
in
their
literature
but
these
assertions
are
made
only
to
discredit
if
possible
a
philosophical
movement
that
threatens
to
completely
upset
prevailing
erroneous
theological
dogmas
for
all
through
hindu
literature
mahatmas
are
often
spoken
of
and
in
parts
of
the
north
of
that
country
the
term
is
common
in
the
very
old
poem
the
revered
by
all
hindu
sects
and
admitted
by
the
western
critics
to
be
noble
as
well
as
beautiful
there
is
a
verse
reading
such
a
mahatma
is
difficult
to
but
irrespective
of
all
disputes
as
to
specific
names
there
is
sufficient
argument
and
proof
to
show
that
a
body
of
men
having
the
wonderful
knowledge
described
above
has
always
existed
and
probably
exists
the
older
mysteries
continually
refer
to
them
ancient
egypt
had
them
in
her
great
sons
of
the
sun
and
friends
of
great
gods
there
is
a
habit
of
belittling
the
ideas
of
the
ancients
which
is
in
itself
belittling
to
the
people
of
even
the
christian
who
reverently
speaks
of
abraham
as
the
friend
of
god
will
scornfully
laugh
at
the
idea
of
the
claims
of
egyptian
rulers
to
the
same
friendship
being
other
than
childish
assumption
of
dignity
and
title
but
the
truth
is
these
great
egyptians
were
initiates
members
of
the
one
great
lodge
which
includes
all
others
of
whatever
degree
or
operation
the
later
and
declining
egyptians
of
course
must
have
imitated
their
predecessors
but
that
was
when
the
true
doctrine
was
beginning
once
more
to
be
obscured
upon
the
rise
of
dogma
and
priesthood
the
story
of
apollonius
of
tyana
is
about
a
member
of
one
of
the
same
ancient
orders
appearing
among
men
at
a
descending
cycle
and
only
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
a
witness
upon
the
scene
for
future
generations
abraham
and
moses
of
the
jews
are
two
other
initiates
adepts
who
had
their
work
to
do
with
a
certain
people
and
in
the
history
of
abraham
we
meet
with
melchizedek
who
was
so
much
beyond
abraham
that
he
had
the
right
to
confer
upon
the
latter
a
dignity
a
privilege
or
a
blessing
the
same
chapter
of
human
history
which
contains
the
names
of
moses
and
abraham
is
illuminated
also
by
that
of
solomon
and
thus
these
three
make
a
great
triad
of
adepts
the
record
of
whose
deeds
can
not
be
brushed
aside
as
folly
and
devoid
of
basis
moses
was
educated
by
the
egyptians
and
in
midian
from
both
of
which
he
gained
much
occult
knowledge
and
any
student
of
the
great
universal
masonry
can
perceive
all
through
his
books
the
hand
the
plan
and
the
work
of
a
master
abraham
again
knew
all
the
arts
and
much
of
the
power
in
psychical
realms
that
were
cultivated
in
his
day
or
else
he
could
not
have
consorted
with
kings
nor
have
been
the
friend
of
god
and
the
reference
to
his
conversations
with
the
almighty
in
respect
to
the
destruction
of
cities
alone
shows
him
to
have
been
an
adept
who
had
long
ago
passed
beyond
the
need
of
ceremonial
or
other
adventitious
aids
solomon
completes
this
triad
and
stands
out
in
characters
of
fire
around
him
is
clustered
such
a
mass
of
legend
and
story
about
his
dealings
with
the
elemental
powers
and
of
his
magic
possessions
that
one
must
condemn
the
whole
ancient
world
as
a
collection
of
fools
who
made
lies
for
amusement
if
a
denial
is
made
of
his
being
a
great
character
a
wonderful
example
of
the
incarnation
among
men
of
a
powerful
adept
we
do
not
have
to
accept
the
name
solomon
nor
the
pretense
that
he
reigned
over
the
jews
but
we
must
admit
the
fact
that
somewhere
in
the
misty
time
to
which
the
jewish
records
refer
there
lived
and
moved
among
the
people
of
the
earth
one
who
was
an
adept
and
given
that
name
afterwards
peripatetics
and
microscopic
critics
may
affect
to
see
in
the
prevalence
of
universal
tradition
naught
but
evidence
of
the
gullibility
of
men
and
their
power
to
imitate
but
the
true
student
of
human
nature
and
life
knows
that
the
universal
tradition
is
true
and
arises
from
the
facts
in
the
history
of
man
turning
to
india
so
long
forgotten
and
ignored
by
the
lusty
and
egotistical
the
fighting
and
the
trading
west
we
find
her
full
of
the
lore
relating
to
these
wonderful
men
of
whom
noah
abraham
moses
and
solomon
are
only
examples
there
the
people
are
fitted
by
temperament
and
climate
to
be
the
preservers
of
the
philosophical
ethical
and
psychical
jewels
that
would
have
been
forever
lost
to
us
had
they
been
left
to
the
ravages
of
such
goths
and
vandals
as
western
nations
were
in
the
early
days
of
their
struggle
for
education
and
civilization
if
the
men
who
wantonly
burned
up
vast
masses
of
historical
and
ethnological
treasures
found
by
the
minions
of
the
catholic
rulers
of
spain
in
central
and
south
america
could
have
known
of
and
put
their
hands
upon
the
books
and
records
of
india
before
the
protecting
shield
of
england
was
raised
against
them
they
would
have
destroyed
them
all
as
they
did
for
the
americans
and
as
their
predecessors
attempted
to
do
for
the
alexandrian
library
fortunately
events
worked
otherwise
all
along
the
stream
of
indian
literature
we
can
find
the
names
by
scores
of
great
adepts
who
were
well
known
to
the
people
and
who
all
taught
the
same
great
epic
of
the
human
soul
their
names
are
unfamiliar
to
western
ears
but
the
records
of
their
thoughts
their
work
and
powers
remain
still
more
in
the
quiet
unmoveable
east
there
are
by
the
hundred
persons
who
know
of
their
own
knowledge
that
the
great
lodge
still
exists
and
has
its
mahatmas
adepts
initiates
brothers
and
yet
further
in
that
land
are
such
a
number
of
experts
in
the
practical
application
of
minor
though
still
very
astonishing
power
over
nature
and
her
forces
that
we
have
an
irresistible
mass
of
human
evidence
to
prove
the
proposition
laid
down
and
if
teaching
of
this
great
as
said
both
scientific
and
religious
then
from
the
ethical
side
we
have
still
more
proof
a
mighty
triad
acting
on
and
through
ethics
is
that
composed
of
buddha
confucius
and
jesus
the
first
a
hindoo
founds
a
religion
which
embraces
many
more
people
than
christianity
teaching
centuries
before
jesus
the
ethics
which
he
taught
and
which
had
been
given
out
even
centuries
before
buddha
jesus
coming
to
reform
his
people
repeats
these
ancient
ethics
and
confucius
does
the
same
thing
for
ancient
and
honorable
china
the
theosophist
says
that
all
these
great
names
represent
members
of
the
one
single
brotherhood
who
all
have
a
single
doctrine
and
the
extraordinary
characters
who
now
and
again
appear
in
western
civilization
such
as
germain
jacob
boehme
cagliostro
paracelsus
mesmer
count
martin
and
madame
blavatsky
are
agents
for
the
doing
of
the
work
of
the
great
lodge
at
the
proper
time
it
is
true
they
are
generally
reviled
and
classed
as
no
one
can
find
out
why
they
are
when
they
generally
confer
benefits
and
lay
down
propositions
or
make
discoveries
of
great
value
to
science
after
they
have
died
but
jesus
himself
would
be
called
an
impostor
if
he
appeared
in
some
fifth
avenue
theatrical
church
rebuking
the
professed
christians
paracelsus
was
the
originator
of
valuable
methods
and
treatments
in
medicine
now
universally
used
mesmer
taught
hypnotism
under
another
name
madame
blavatsky
brought
once
more
to
the
attention
of
the
west
the
most
important
system
long
known
to
the
lodge
respecting
man
his
nature
and
destiny
but
all
are
alike
called
imposters
by
a
people
who
have
no
original
philosophy
of
their
own
and
whose
mendicant
and
criminal
classes
exceed
in
misery
and
in
number
those
of
any
civilization
on
the
earth
it
will
not
be
unusual
for
nearly
all
occidental
readers
to
wonder
how
men
could
possibly
know
so
much
and
have
such
power
over
the
operations
of
natural
law
as
i
have
ascribed
to
the
initiates
now
so
commonly
spoken
of
as
the
mahatmas
in
india
china
and
other
oriental
lands
no
wonder
would
arise
on
these
heads
because
there
although
everything
of
a
material
civilization
is
just
now
in
a
backward
state
they
have
never
lost
a
belief
in
the
inner
nature
of
man
and
in
the
power
he
may
exercise
if
he
will
consequently
living
examples
of
such
powers
and
capacities
have
not
been
absent
from
those
people
but
in
the
west
a
materialistic
civilization
having
arisen
through
a
denial
of
the
soul
life
and
nature
consequent
upon
a
reaction
from
illogical
dogmatism
there
has
not
been
any
investigation
of
these
subjects
and
until
lately
the
general
public
has
not
believed
in
the
possibility
of
anyone
save
a
supposed
god
having
such
power
a
mahatma
endowed
with
power
over
space
time
mind
and
matter
is
a
possibility
just
because
he
is
a
perfected
man
every
human
being
has
the
germ
of
all
the
powers
attributed
to
these
great
initiates
the
difference
lying
solely
in
the
fact
that
we
have
in
general
not
developed
what
we
possess
the
germ
of
while
the
mahatma
has
gone
through
the
training
and
experience
which
have
caused
all
the
unseen
human
powers
to
develop
in
him
and
conferred
gifts
that
look
to
his
struggling
brother
below
telepathy
and
hypnotism
all
long
ago
known
to
theosophy
show
the
existence
in
the
human
subject
of
planes
of
consciousness
functions
and
faculties
hitherto
undreamed
of
and
the
influencing
of
the
mind
of
the
hypnotized
subject
at
a
distance
prove
the
existence
of
a
mind
which
is
not
wholly
dependent
upon
a
brain
and
that
a
medium
exists
through
which
the
influencing
thought
may
be
sent
it
is
under
this
law
that
the
initiates
can
communicate
with
each
other
at
no
matter
what
distance
its
not
yet
admitted
by
the
schools
of
the
hypnotizers
is
that
if
the
two
minds
vibrate
or
change
into
the
same
state
they
will
think
alike
or
in
other
words
the
one
who
is
to
hear
at
a
distance
receives
the
impression
sent
by
the
other
in
the
same
way
with
all
other
powers
no
matter
how
extraordinary
they
are
all
natural
although
now
unusual
just
as
great
musical
ability
is
natural
though
not
usual
or
common
if
an
initiate
can
make
a
solid
object
move
without
contact
it
is
because
he
understands
the
two
laws
of
attraction
and
repulsion
of
which
gravitation
is
but
the
name
for
one
if
he
is
able
to
precipitate
out
of
the
viewless
air
the
carbon
which
we
know
is
in
it
forming
the
carbon
into
sentences
upon
the
paper
it
is
through
his
knowledge
of
the
occult
higher
chemistry
and
the
use
of
a
trained
and
powerful
image
making
faculty
which
every
man
possesses
if
he
reads
your
thoughts
with
ease
that
results
from
the
use
of
the
inner
and
only
real
powers
of
sight
which
require
no
retina
to
see
the
web
which
the
vibrating
brain
of
man
weaves
about
him
all
that
the
mahatma
may
do
is
natural
to
the
perfected
man
but
if
those
powers
are
not
at
once
revealed
to
us
it
is
because
the
race
is
as
yet
selfish
altogether
and
still
living
for
the
present
and
the
transitory
i
repeat
then
that
though
the
true
doctrine
disappears
for
a
time
from
among
men
it
is
bound
to
reäppear
because
first
it
is
impacted
in
the
imperishable
center
of
man
s
nature
and
secondly
the
lodge
forever
preserves
it
not
only
in
actual
objective
records
but
also
in
the
intelligent
and
fully
men
who
having
successfully
overpassed
the
many
periods
of
evolution
which
preceded
the
one
we
are
now
involved
in
can
not
lose
the
precious
possessions
they
have
acquired
and
because
the
elder
brothers
are
the
highest
product
of
evolution
through
whom
alone
in
cöoperation
with
the
whole
human
family
the
further
regular
and
workmanlike
prosecution
of
the
plans
of
the
great
architect
of
the
universe
could
be
carried
on
i
have
thought
it
well
to
advert
to
them
and
their
universal
lodge
before
going
to
other
parts
of
the
subject
chapter
ii
the
teachings
of
theosophy
deal
for
the
present
chiefly
with
our
earth
although
its
purview
extends
to
all
the
worlds
since
no
part
of
the
manifested
universe
is
outside
the
single
body
of
laws
which
operate
upon
us
our
globe
being
one
of
the
solar
system
is
certainly
connected
with
venus
jupiter
and
other
planets
but
as
the
great
human
family
has
to
remain
with
its
material
all
the
units
of
the
race
which
are
ready
are
perfected
the
evolution
of
that
family
is
of
greater
importance
to
the
members
of
it
some
particulars
respecting
the
other
planets
may
be
given
later
on
first
let
us
take
a
general
view
of
the
laws
governing
all
the
universe
evolves
from
the
unknown
into
which
no
man
or
mind
however
high
can
inquire
on
seven
planes
or
in
seven
ways
or
methods
in
all
worlds
and
this
sevenfold
differentiation
causes
all
the
worlds
of
the
universe
and
the
beings
thereon
to
have
a
septenary
constitution
as
was
taught
of
old
the
little
worlds
and
the
great
are
copies
of
the
whole
and
the
minutest
insect
as
well
as
the
most
highly
developed
being
are
in
little
or
in
great
of
the
vast
inclusive
original
hence
sprang
the
saying
as
above
so
below
which
the
hermetic
philosophers
used
the
divisions
of
the
sevenfold
universe
may
be
laid
down
roughly
as
the
absolute
spirit
mind
matter
will
akasa
or
æther
and
life
in
place
of
the
absolute
we
can
use
the
word
space
for
space
is
that
which
ever
is
and
in
which
all
manifestation
must
take
place
the
term
akasa
taken
from
the
sanscrit
is
used
in
place
of
æther
because
the
english
language
has
not
yet
evolved
a
word
to
properly
designate
that
tenuous
state
of
matter
which
is
now
sometimes
called
ether
by
modern
scientists
as
to
the
absolute
we
can
do
no
more
than
say
it
is
none
of
the
great
teachers
of
the
school
ascribe
qualities
to
the
absolute
although
all
the
qualities
exist
in
it
our
knowledge
begins
with
differentiation
and
all
manifested
objects
beings
or
powers
are
only
differentiations
of
the
great
unknown
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
the
absolute
periodically
differentiates
itself
and
periodically
withdraws
the
differentiated
into
itself
the
first
metaphysically
as
to
spirit
with
which
appears
matter
and
mind
akasa
is
produced
from
matter
and
spirit
will
is
the
force
of
spirit
in
action
and
life
is
a
resultant
of
the
action
of
akasa
moved
by
spirit
upon
matter
but
the
matter
here
spoken
of
is
not
that
which
is
vulgarly
known
as
such
it
is
the
real
matter
which
is
always
invisible
and
has
sometimes
been
called
primordial
matter
in
the
brahmanical
system
it
is
denominated
the
ancient
teaching
always
held
as
is
now
admitted
by
science
that
we
see
or
perceive
only
the
phenomena
but
not
the
essential
nature
body
or
being
of
matter
mind
is
the
intelligent
part
of
the
cosmos
and
in
the
collection
of
seven
differentiations
above
roughly
sketched
mind
is
that
in
which
the
plan
of
the
cosmos
is
fixed
or
contained
this
plan
is
brought
over
from
a
prior
period
of
manifestation
which
added
to
its
perfectness
and
no
limit
can
be
set
to
its
evolutionary
possibilities
in
perfectness
because
there
was
never
any
beginning
to
the
periodical
manifestations
of
the
absolute
there
never
will
be
any
end
but
forever
the
going
forth
and
withdrawing
into
the
unknown
will
go
on
wherever
a
world
or
system
of
worlds
is
evolving
there
the
plan
has
been
laid
down
in
universal
mind
the
original
force
comes
from
spirit
the
basis
is
is
in
fact
sustains
all
the
forms
requiring
life
and
akasa
is
the
connecting
link
between
matter
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
when
a
world
or
a
system
comes
to
the
end
of
certain
great
cycles
men
record
a
cataclysm
in
history
or
tradition
these
traditions
abound
among
the
jews
in
their
flood
with
the
babylonians
in
theirs
in
egyptian
papyri
in
the
hindu
cosmology
and
none
of
them
as
merely
confirmatory
of
the
little
jewish
tradition
but
all
pointing
to
early
teaching
and
dim
recollection
also
of
the
periodical
destructions
and
renovations
the
hebraic
story
is
but
a
poor
fragment
torn
from
the
pavement
of
the
temple
of
truth
just
as
there
are
periodical
minor
cataclysms
or
partial
destructions
so
the
doctrine
holds
there
is
the
universal
evolution
and
involution
forever
the
great
breath
goes
forth
and
returns
again
as
it
proceeds
outwards
objects
worlds
and
men
appear
as
it
recedes
all
disappear
into
the
original
source
this
is
the
waking
and
the
sleeping
of
the
great
being
the
day
and
the
night
of
brahma
the
prototype
of
our
waking
days
and
sleeping
nights
as
men
of
our
disappearance
from
the
scene
at
the
end
of
one
little
human
life
and
our
return
again
to
take
up
the
unfinished
work
in
another
life
in
a
new
day
the
real
age
of
the
world
has
long
been
involved
in
doubt
for
western
investigators
who
up
to
the
present
have
shown
a
singular
unwillingness
to
take
instruction
from
the
records
of
oriental
people
much
older
than
the
west
yet
with
the
orientals
is
the
truth
about
the
matter
it
is
admitted
that
egyptian
civilization
flourished
many
centuries
ago
and
as
there
are
no
living
egyptian
schools
of
ancient
learning
to
offend
modern
pride
and
perhaps
because
the
jews
came
out
of
egypt
to
fasten
the
mosaic
misunderstood
tradition
upon
modern
progress
the
inscriptions
cut
in
rocks
and
written
on
papyri
obtain
a
little
more
credit
than
the
living
thought
and
record
of
the
hindus
for
the
latter
are
still
among
us
and
it
would
never
do
to
admit
that
a
poor
and
conquered
race
possesses
knowledge
respecting
the
age
of
man
and
his
world
which
the
western
flower
of
culture
war
and
annexation
knows
nothing
of
ever
since
the
ignorant
monks
and
theologians
of
asia
minor
and
europe
succeeded
in
imposing
the
mosaic
account
of
the
genesis
of
earth
and
man
upon
the
coming
western
evolution
the
most
learned
even
of
our
scientific
men
have
stood
in
fear
of
the
years
that
elapsed
since
adam
or
have
been
warped
in
thought
and
perception
whenever
their
eyes
turned
to
any
chronology
different
from
that
of
a
few
tribes
of
the
sons
of
jacob
even
the
noble
aged
and
silent
pyramid
of
gizeh
guarded
by
sphinx
and
memnon
made
of
stone
has
been
degraded
by
piazzi
smyth
and
others
into
a
proof
that
the
british
inch
must
prevail
and
that
a
continental
sunday
controverts
the
law
of
the
most
high
yet
in
the
mosaic
account
where
one
would
expect
to
find
a
reference
to
such
a
proof
as
the
pyramid
we
can
discover
not
a
single
hint
of
it
and
only
a
record
of
the
building
by
king
solomon
of
a
temple
of
which
there
never
was
a
trace
but
the
theosophist
knows
why
the
hebraic
tradition
came
to
be
thus
an
apparent
drag
on
the
mind
of
the
west
he
knows
the
connection
between
jew
and
egyptian
what
is
and
is
to
be
the
resurrection
of
the
old
pyramid
builders
of
the
nile
valley
and
where
the
plans
of
those
ancient
master
masons
have
been
hidden
from
the
profane
eyes
until
the
cycle
should
roll
round
again
for
their
bringing
forth
the
jews
preserved
merely
a
part
of
the
learning
of
egypt
hidden
under
the
letter
of
the
books
of
moses
and
it
is
there
still
to
this
day
in
what
they
call
the
cabalistic
or
hidden
meaning
of
the
scriptures
but
the
egyptian
souls
who
helped
in
planning
the
pyramid
of
gizeh
who
took
part
in
the
egyptian
government
theology
science
and
civilization
departed
from
their
old
race
that
race
died
out
and
the
former
egyptians
took
up
their
work
in
the
oncoming
races
of
the
west
especially
in
those
which
are
now
repeopling
the
american
continents
when
egypt
and
india
were
younger
there
was
a
constant
intercourse
between
them
they
both
in
the
opinion
of
the
theosophist
thought
alike
but
fate
ruled
that
of
the
two
the
hindus
only
should
preserve
the
old
ideas
among
a
living
people
i
will
therefore
take
from
the
brahmanical
records
of
hindustan
their
doctrine
about
the
days
nights
years
and
life
of
brahma
who
represents
the
universe
and
the
worlds
the
doctrine
at
once
upsets
the
interpretation
so
long
given
to
the
mosaic
tradition
but
fully
accords
with
the
evident
account
in
genesis
of
other
and
former
creations
with
the
cabalistic
construction
of
the
old
testament
verse
about
the
kings
of
edom
who
there
represent
former
periods
of
evolution
prior
to
that
started
with
adam
and
also
coincides
with
the
belief
held
by
some
of
the
early
christian
fathers
who
told
their
brethren
about
wonderful
previous
worlds
and
creations
the
day
of
brahma
is
said
to
last
one
thousand
years
and
his
night
is
of
equal
length
in
the
christian
bible
is
a
verse
saying
that
one
day
is
as
a
thousand
years
to
the
lord
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
this
has
generally
been
used
to
magnify
the
power
of
jehovah
but
it
has
a
suspicious
resemblance
to
the
older
doctrine
of
the
length
of
brahma
s
day
and
night
it
would
be
of
more
value
if
construed
to
be
a
statement
of
the
periodical
coming
forth
for
great
days
and
nights
of
equal
length
of
the
universe
of
manifested
worlds
a
day
of
mortals
is
reckoned
by
the
sun
and
is
but
twelve
hours
in
length
on
mercury
it
would
be
different
and
on
saturn
or
uranus
still
more
so
but
a
day
of
brahma
is
made
up
of
what
are
called
period
between
two
in
number
these
include
four
billion
three
hundred
and
twenty
million
mortal
or
earth
years
which
is
one
day
of
brahma
when
this
day
opens
cosmic
evolution
so
far
as
relates
to
this
solar
system
begins
and
occupies
between
one
and
two
billions
of
years
in
evolving
the
very
ethereal
first
matter
before
the
astral
kingdoms
of
mineral
vegetable
animal
and
men
are
possible
this
second
step
takes
some
three
hundred
millions
of
years
and
then
still
more
material
processes
go
forward
for
the
production
of
the
tangible
kingdoms
of
nature
including
man
this
covers
over
one
and
billions
of
years
and
the
number
of
solar
years
included
in
the
present
human
period
is
over
eighteen
millions
of
years
this
is
exactly
what
herbert
spencer
designates
as
the
gradual
coming
forth
of
the
known
and
heterogeneous
from
the
unknown
and
homogeneous
for
the
ancient
egyptian
and
hindu
theosophists
never
admitted
a
creation
out
of
nothing
but
ever
strenuously
insisted
upon
evolution
by
gradual
stages
of
the
heterogeneous
and
differentiated
from
the
homogeneous
and
undifferentiated
no
mind
can
comprehend
the
infinite
and
absolute
unknown
which
has
no
beginning
and
shall
have
no
end
which
is
both
last
and
first
because
whether
differentiated
or
withdrawn
into
itself
it
ever
is
this
is
the
god
spoken
of
in
the
christian
bible
as
the
one
around
whose
pavilion
there
is
darkness
this
cosmic
and
human
chronology
of
the
hindus
is
laughed
at
by
western
orientalists
yet
they
can
furnish
nothing
better
and
are
continually
disagreeing
with
each
other
on
the
same
subject
in
wilson
s
translation
of
he
calls
it
all
fiction
based
on
nothing
and
childish
boasting
but
the
free
masons
who
remain
inactive
hereupon
ought
to
know
better
they
could
find
in
the
story
of
the
building
of
solomon
s
temple
from
the
heterogeneous
materials
brought
from
everywhere
and
its
erection
without
the
noise
of
a
tool
being
heard
the
agreement
with
these
ideas
of
their
egyptian
and
hindu
brothers
for
solomon
s
temple
means
man
whose
frame
is
built
up
finished
and
decorated
without
the
least
noise
but
the
materials
had
to
be
found
gathered
together
and
fashioned
in
other
and
distant
places
these
are
in
the
periods
above
spoken
of
very
distant
and
very
silent
man
could
not
have
his
bodily
temple
to
live
in
until
all
the
matter
in
and
about
his
world
had
been
found
by
the
master
who
is
the
inner
man
when
found
the
plans
for
working
it
required
to
be
detailed
they
then
had
to
be
carried
out
in
different
detail
until
all
the
parts
should
be
perfectly
ready
and
fit
for
placing
in
the
final
structure
so
in
the
vast
stretch
of
time
which
began
after
the
first
almost
intangible
matter
had
been
gathered
and
kneaded
the
material
and
vegetable
kingdoms
had
sole
possession
here
with
the
was
hidden
from
sight
within
carrying
forward
the
plans
for
the
foundations
of
the
human
temple
all
of
this
requires
many
many
ages
since
we
know
that
nature
never
leaps
and
when
the
rough
work
was
completed
when
the
human
temple
was
erected
many
more
ages
would
be
required
for
all
the
servants
the
priests
and
the
counsellors
to
learn
their
parts
properly
so
that
man
the
master
might
be
able
to
use
the
temple
for
its
best
and
highest
purposes
the
ancient
doctrine
is
far
nobler
than
the
christian
religious
one
or
that
of
the
purely
scientific
school
the
religious
gives
a
theory
which
conflicts
with
reason
and
fact
while
science
can
give
for
the
facts
which
it
observes
no
reason
which
is
in
any
way
noble
or
elevating
theosophy
alone
inclusive
of
all
systems
and
every
experience
gives
the
key
the
plan
the
doctrine
the
truth
the
real
age
of
the
world
is
asserted
by
theosophy
to
be
almost
incalculable
and
that
of
man
as
he
is
now
formed
is
over
eighteen
millions
of
years
what
has
become
at
last
man
is
of
vastly
greater
age
for
before
the
present
two
sexes
appeared
the
human
creature
was
sometimes
of
one
shape
and
sometimes
of
another
until
the
whole
plan
had
been
fully
worked
out
into
our
present
form
function
and
capacity
this
is
found
to
be
referred
to
in
the
ancient
books
written
for
the
profane
where
man
is
said
to
have
been
at
one
time
globular
in
shape
this
was
at
a
time
when
the
conditions
favored
such
a
form
and
of
course
it
was
longer
ago
than
eighteen
millions
of
years
and
when
this
globular
form
was
the
rule
the
sexes
as
we
know
them
had
not
differentiated
and
hence
there
was
but
one
sex
or
if
you
like
no
sex
at
all
during
all
these
ages
before
our
man
came
into
being
evolution
was
carrying
on
the
work
of
perfecting
various
powers
which
are
now
our
possession
this
was
accomplished
by
the
ego
or
real
man
going
through
experience
in
countless
conditions
of
matter
all
different
one
from
the
other
and
the
same
plan
in
general
was
and
is
pursued
as
prevails
in
respect
to
the
general
evolution
of
the
universe
to
which
i
have
before
adverted
that
is
details
were
first
worked
out
in
spheres
of
being
very
ethereal
metaphysical
in
fact
then
the
next
step
brought
the
same
details
to
be
worked
out
on
a
plane
of
matter
a
little
more
dense
until
at
last
it
could
be
done
on
our
present
plane
of
what
we
miscall
gross
matter
in
these
anterior
states
the
senses
existed
in
germ
as
it
were
or
in
idea
until
the
astral
plane
which
is
next
to
this
one
was
arrived
at
and
then
they
were
concentrated
so
as
to
be
the
actual
senses
we
now
use
through
the
agency
of
the
different
outer
organs
these
outer
organs
of
sight
touch
and
hearing
and
tasting
are
often
mistaken
by
the
unlearned
or
the
thoughtless
for
the
real
organs
and
senses
but
he
who
stops
to
think
must
see
that
the
senses
are
interior
and
that
their
outer
organs
are
but
mediators
between
the
visible
universe
and
the
real
perceiver
within
and
all
these
various
powers
and
potentialities
being
well
worked
out
in
this
slow
but
sure
process
at
last
man
is
put
upon
the
scene
a
sevenfold
being
just
as
the
universe
and
earth
itself
are
sevenfold
each
of
his
seven
principles
is
derived
from
one
of
the
great
first
seven
divisions
and
each
relates
to
a
planet
or
scene
of
evolution
and
to
a
race
in
which
that
evolution
was
carried
out
so
the
first
sevenfold
differentiation
is
important
to
be
borne
in
mind
since
it
is
the
basis
of
all
that
follows
just
as
the
universal
evolution
is
septenary
so
the
evolution
of
humanity
sevenfold
in
its
constitution
is
carried
on
upon
a
septenary
earth
this
is
spoken
of
in
theosophical
literature
as
the
sevenfold
planetary
chain
and
is
intimately
connected
with
man
s
special
evolution
chapter
iii
coming
now
to
our
earth
the
view
put
forward
by
theosophy
regarding
its
genesis
its
evolution
and
the
evolution
of
the
human
animal
and
other
monads
is
quite
different
from
modern
ideas
and
in
some
things
contrary
to
accepted
theories
but
the
theories
of
are
not
stable
they
change
with
each
century
while
the
theosophical
one
never
alters
because
in
the
opinion
of
those
elder
brothers
who
have
caused
its
repromulgation
and
pointed
to
its
confirmation
in
ancient
books
it
is
but
a
statement
of
facts
in
nature
the
modern
theory
is
on
the
contrary
always
speculative
changeable
and
continually
altered
following
the
general
plan
outlined
in
preceding
pages
the
earth
is
sevenfold
it
is
an
entity
and
not
a
mere
lump
of
gross
matter
and
being
thus
an
entity
of
a
septenary
nature
there
must
be
six
other
globes
which
roll
with
it
in
space
this
company
of
seven
globes
has
been
called
the
earth
chain
the
planetary
chain
in
this
is
clearly
stated
but
there
a
rather
hard
and
fast
materialistic
view
of
it
is
given
and
the
reader
led
to
believe
that
the
doctrine
speaks
of
seven
distinct
globes
all
separated
from
though
connected
with
each
other
one
is
forced
to
conclude
that
the
author
meant
to
say
that
the
globe
earth
is
as
distinct
from
the
other
six
as
venus
is
from
mars
this
is
not
the
doctrine
the
earth
is
one
of
seven
globes
in
respect
to
man
s
consciousness
only
because
when
he
functions
on
one
of
the
seven
he
perceives
it
as
a
distinct
globe
and
does
not
see
the
other
six
this
is
in
perfect
correspondence
with
man
himself
who
has
six
other
constituents
of
which
only
the
gross
body
is
visible
to
him
because
he
is
now
functioning
on
the
the
fourth
his
body
represents
the
earth
the
whole
seven
globes
constitute
one
single
mass
or
great
globe
and
they
all
interpenetrate
each
other
but
we
have
to
say
globe
because
the
ultimate
shape
is
globular
or
spherical
if
one
relies
too
closely
on
the
explanation
made
by
sinnett
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
globes
did
not
interpenetrate
each
other
but
were
connected
by
currents
or
lines
of
magnetic
force
and
if
too
close
attention
is
paid
to
the
diagrams
used
in
the
to
illustrate
the
scheme
without
paying
due
regard
to
the
explanations
and
cautions
given
by
blavatsky
the
same
error
may
be
made
but
both
she
and
her
adept
teachers
say
that
the
seven
globes
of
our
chain
are
in
with
each
other
but
not
in
this
is
further
enforced
by
cautions
not
to
rely
on
statistics
or
plane
surface
diagrams
but
to
look
at
the
metaphysical
and
spiritual
aspect
of
the
theory
as
stated
in
english
thus
from
the
very
source
of
sinnett
s
book
we
have
the
statement
that
these
globes
are
united
in
one
mass
though
differing
from
each
other
in
substance
and
that
this
difference
of
substance
is
due
to
change
of
centre
of
consciousness
vol
first
edition
the
earth
chain
of
seven
globes
as
thus
defined
is
the
direct
reïncarnation
of
a
former
chain
of
seven
globes
and
that
former
family
of
seven
was
the
moon
chain
the
moon
itself
being
the
visible
representative
of
the
fourth
globe
of
the
old
chain
when
that
former
vast
entity
composed
of
the
moon
and
six
others
all
united
in
one
mass
reached
its
limit
of
life
it
died
just
as
any
being
dies
each
one
of
the
seven
sent
its
energies
into
space
and
gave
similar
life
or
vibration
to
cosmic
the
total
cohesive
force
of
the
whole
kept
the
seven
energies
together
this
resulted
in
the
evolving
of
the
present
earth
chain
of
seven
centres
of
energy
or
evolution
combined
in
one
mass
as
the
moon
was
the
fourth
of
the
old
series
it
is
on
the
same
plane
of
perception
as
the
earth
and
as
we
are
now
confined
in
our
consciousness
largely
to
earth
we
are
able
only
to
see
one
of
the
old
wit
our
moon
when
we
are
functioning
on
any
of
the
other
seven
we
will
perceive
in
our
sky
the
corresponding
old
corpse
which
will
then
be
a
moon
and
we
will
not
see
the
present
moon
venus
mars
mercury
and
other
visible
planets
are
all
globes
of
distinct
planetary
masses
and
for
that
reason
are
visible
to
us
their
companion
six
centres
of
energy
and
consciousness
being
invisible
all
diagrams
on
plane
surfaces
will
only
becloud
the
theory
because
a
diagram
necessitates
linear
divisions
the
stream
or
mass
of
egos
which
evolves
on
the
seven
globes
of
our
chain
is
limited
in
number
yet
the
actual
quantity
is
enormous
for
though
the
universe
is
limitless
and
infinite
yet
in
any
particular
portion
of
cosmos
in
which
manifestation
and
evolution
have
begun
there
is
a
limit
to
the
extent
of
manifestation
and
to
the
number
of
egos
engaged
therein
and
the
whole
number
of
monads
now
going
through
evolution
on
our
earth
chain
came
over
from
the
old
seven
planets
or
globes
which
i
have
described
calls
this
mass
of
egos
a
life
wave
meaning
the
stream
of
monads
it
reached
this
planetary
mass
represented
to
our
consciousness
by
the
central
point
our
earth
and
began
on
globe
a
or
no
coming
like
an
army
or
river
the
first
portion
began
on
globe
a
and
went
through
a
long
evolution
there
in
bodies
suited
to
such
a
state
of
matter
and
then
passed
on
to
b
and
so
on
through
the
whole
seven
greater
states
of
consciousness
which
have
been
called
globes
when
the
first
portion
left
a
others
streamed
in
and
pursued
the
same
course
the
whole
army
proceeding
with
regularity
round
the
septenary
route
this
journey
went
on
for
four
circlings
round
the
whole
and
then
the
whole
stream
or
army
of
egos
from
the
old
moon
chain
had
arrived
and
being
complete
no
more
entered
after
the
middle
of
the
fourth
round
the
same
circling
process
of
these
differently
arrived
classes
goes
on
for
seven
complete
rounds
of
the
whole
seven
planetary
centres
of
consciousness
and
when
the
seven
are
ended
as
much
perfection
as
is
possible
in
the
immense
period
occupied
will
have
been
attained
and
then
this
chain
or
mass
of
globes
will
die
in
its
turn
to
give
birth
to
still
another
series
each
one
of
the
globes
is
used
by
evolutionary
law
for
the
development
of
seven
races
and
of
senses
faculties
and
powers
appropriate
to
that
state
of
matter
the
experience
of
the
whole
seven
globes
being
needed
to
make
a
perfect
development
hence
we
have
the
rounds
and
races
the
round
is
a
circling
of
the
seven
centres
of
planetary
consciousness
the
race
the
racial
development
on
one
of
those
seven
there
are
seven
races
for
each
globe
but
the
total
of
races
only
makes
up
seven
great
races
the
special
septennate
of
races
on
each
globe
or
planetary
centre
composing
in
reality
one
race
of
seven
constituents
or
special
peculiarities
of
function
and
power
and
as
no
complete
race
could
be
evolved
in
a
moment
on
any
globe
the
slow
orderly
processes
of
nature
which
allow
no
jumps
must
proceed
by
appropriate
means
hence
have
to
be
evolved
one
after
the
other
before
the
perfect
root
race
is
formed
and
then
the
root
race
sends
off
its
while
it
is
declining
and
preparing
for
the
advent
of
the
next
great
race
as
illustrating
this
it
is
distinctly
taught
that
on
the
americas
is
to
be
evolved
the
and
here
all
the
races
of
the
earth
are
now
engaged
in
a
great
amalgamation
from
which
will
result
a
very
highly
developed
after
which
others
will
be
evolved
by
similar
processes
until
the
new
one
is
completed
between
the
end
of
any
great
race
and
the
beginning
of
another
there
is
a
period
of
rest
so
far
as
the
globe
is
concerned
for
then
the
stream
of
human
egos
leaves
it
for
another
one
of
the
chain
in
order
to
go
on
with
further
evolution
of
powers
and
faculties
there
but
when
the
last
the
seventh
race
has
appeared
and
fully
perfected
itself
a
great
dissolution
comes
on
similar
to
that
which
i
briefly
described
as
preceding
the
birth
of
the
earth
s
chain
and
then
the
world
disappears
as
a
tangible
thing
and
so
far
as
the
human
ear
is
concerned
there
is
silence
this
it
is
said
is
the
root
of
the
belief
so
general
that
the
world
will
come
to
an
end
that
there
will
be
a
or
that
there
have
been
universal
floods
or
fires
taking
up
evolution
on
the
earth
it
is
stated
that
the
stream
of
monads
begins
first
to
work
up
the
mass
of
matter
in
what
are
called
elemental
conditions
when
all
is
gaseous
or
fiery
for
the
ancient
and
true
theory
is
that
no
evolution
is
possible
without
the
monad
as
vivifying
agent
in
this
first
stage
there
is
no
animal
nor
vegetable
next
comes
the
mineral
when
the
whole
mass
hardens
the
monads
being
all
imprisoned
within
then
the
first
monads
emerge
into
vegetable
forms
which
they
construct
themselves
and
no
animals
yet
appear
next
the
first
class
of
monads
emerges
from
the
vegetable
and
produces
the
animal
then
the
human
astral
and
shadowy
model
and
we
have
minerals
vegetables
animals
and
future
men
for
the
second
and
later
classes
are
still
evolving
in
the
lower
kingdoms
when
the
middle
of
the
fourth
round
is
reached
no
more
monads
emerge
into
the
human
stage
and
will
not
until
a
new
planetary
mass
reïncarnated
from
ours
is
made
this
is
the
whole
process
roughly
given
but
with
many
details
left
out
for
in
one
of
the
rounds
man
appears
before
the
animals
but
this
detail
need
lead
to
no
confusion
and
to
state
it
in
another
way
the
plan
comes
first
in
the
universal
mind
after
which
the
astral
model
or
basis
is
made
and
when
that
astral
model
is
completed
the
whole
process
is
gone
over
so
as
to
condense
the
matter
up
to
the
middle
of
the
fourth
round
subsequent
to
that
which
is
our
future
the
whole
mass
is
spiritualized
with
full
consciousness
and
the
entire
body
of
globes
raised
up
to
a
higher
plane
of
development
in
the
process
of
condensing
above
referred
to
there
is
an
alteration
in
respect
to
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
planet
but
as
to
these
details
the
teachers
have
only
said
that
at
the
second
round
the
plan
varies
but
the
variation
will
not
be
given
to
this
hence
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
it
but
there
is
no
vagueness
on
the
point
that
seven
great
races
have
to
evolve
here
on
this
planet
and
that
the
entire
collection
of
races
has
to
go
seven
times
round
the
whole
series
of
seven
globes
human
beings
did
not
appear
here
in
two
sexes
first
the
first
were
of
no
sex
then
they
altered
into
hermaphrodite
and
lastly
separated
into
male
and
female
and
this
separation
into
male
and
female
for
human
beings
was
over
years
ago
for
that
reason
is
it
said
in
these
ancient
schools
that
our
humanity
is
years
old
and
a
little
over
chapter
iv
respecting
the
nature
of
man
there
are
two
ideas
current
in
the
religious
circles
of
christendom
one
is
the
teaching
and
the
other
the
common
acceptation
of
it
the
first
is
not
secret
to
be
sure
in
the
church
but
it
is
so
seldom
dwelt
upon
in
the
hearing
of
the
laity
as
to
be
almost
arcane
for
the
ordinary
person
nearly
everyone
says
he
has
a
soul
and
a
body
and
there
it
ends
what
the
soul
is
and
whether
it
is
the
real
person
or
whether
it
has
any
powers
of
its
own
are
not
inquired
into
the
preachers
usually
confining
themselves
to
its
salvation
or
damnation
and
by
thus
talking
of
it
as
something
different
from
oneself
the
people
have
acquired
an
underlying
notion
that
they
are
not
souls
because
the
soul
may
be
lost
by
them
from
this
has
come
about
a
tendency
to
materialism
causing
men
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
body
than
to
the
soul
the
latter
being
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
priest
of
the
roman
catholics
and
among
dissenters
the
care
of
it
is
most
frequently
put
off
to
the
dying
day
but
when
the
true
teaching
is
known
it
will
be
seen
that
the
care
of
the
soul
which
is
the
self
is
a
vital
matter
requiring
attention
every
day
and
not
to
be
deferred
without
grievous
injury
resulting
to
the
whole
man
both
soul
and
body
the
christian
teaching
supported
by
paul
since
upon
him
in
fact
dogmatic
christianity
rests
is
that
man
is
composed
of
body
soul
and
spirit
this
is
the
threefold
constitution
of
man
believed
by
the
theologians
but
kept
in
the
background
because
its
examination
might
result
in
the
readoption
of
views
once
orthodox
but
now
heretical
for
when
we
thus
place
soul
between
spirit
and
body
we
come
very
close
to
the
necessity
for
looking
into
the
question
of
the
soul
s
mere
body
can
have
no
responsibility
and
in
order
to
make
the
soul
responsible
for
the
acts
performed
we
must
assume
that
it
has
powers
and
functions
from
this
it
is
easy
to
take
the
position
that
the
soul
may
be
rational
or
irrational
as
the
greeks
sometimes
thought
and
then
there
is
but
a
step
to
further
theosophical
propositions
this
threefold
scheme
of
the
nature
of
man
contains
in
fact
the
theosophical
teaching
of
his
sevenfold
constitution
because
the
four
other
divisions
missing
from
the
category
can
be
found
in
the
powers
and
functions
of
body
and
soul
as
i
shall
attempt
to
show
later
on
this
conviction
that
man
is
a
septenary
and
not
merely
a
duad
was
held
long
ago
and
very
plainly
taught
to
every
one
with
accompanying
demonstrations
but
like
other
philosophical
tenets
it
disappeared
from
sight
because
gradually
withdrawn
at
the
time
when
in
the
east
of
europe
morals
were
degenerating
and
before
materialism
had
gained
full
sway
in
company
with
scepticism
its
twin
upon
its
withdrawal
the
present
dogma
of
body
soul
spirit
was
left
to
christendom
the
reason
for
that
concealment
and
its
rejuvenescence
in
this
century
is
well
put
by
mme
blavatsky
in
the
in
answer
to
the
statement
we
can
not
understand
how
any
danger
could
arise
from
the
revelation
of
such
a
purely
philosophical
doctrine
as
the
evolution
of
the
planetary
chain
she
says
the
danger
was
this
doctrines
such
as
the
planetary
chain
or
the
seven
races
at
once
give
a
clue
to
the
sevenfold
nature
of
man
for
each
principle
is
correlated
to
a
plane
a
planet
and
a
race
and
the
human
principles
are
on
every
plane
correlated
to
the
sevenfold
occult
of
the
higher
planes
being
of
tremendous
occult
power
the
abuse
of
which
would
cause
incalculable
evil
to
humanity
a
clue
which
is
perhaps
no
clue
to
the
present
the
as
they
are
by
their
very
blindness
and
ignorant
materialistic
disbelief
in
the
occult
but
a
clue
which
would
nevertheless
be
very
real
in
the
early
centuries
of
the
christian
era
to
people
fully
convinced
of
the
reality
of
occultism
and
entering
a
cycle
of
degradation
which
made
them
ripe
for
abuse
of
occult
powers
and
sorcery
of
the
worst
description
sinnett
at
one
time
an
official
in
the
government
of
india
first
outlined
in
this
century
the
real
nature
of
man
in
his
book
which
was
made
up
from
information
conveyed
to
him
by
blavatsky
directly
from
the
great
lodge
of
initiates
to
which
reference
has
been
made
and
in
thus
placing
the
old
doctrine
before
western
civilization
he
conferred
a
great
benefit
on
his
generation
and
helped
considerably
the
cause
of
theosophy
his
classification
was
the
body
or
vitality
or
astral
body
or
animal
soul
or
human
soul
or
spiritual
soul
or
spirit
or
the
words
in
italics
being
equivalents
in
the
sanscrit
language
adopted
by
him
for
the
english
terms
this
classification
stands
to
this
day
for
all
practical
purposes
but
it
is
capable
of
modification
and
extension
for
instance
a
later
arrangement
which
places
astral
body
second
instead
of
third
in
the
category
does
not
substantially
alter
it
it
at
once
gives
an
idea
of
what
man
is
very
different
from
the
vague
description
by
the
words
body
and
soul
and
also
boldly
challenges
the
materialistic
conception
that
mind
is
the
product
of
brain
a
portion
of
the
body
no
claim
is
made
that
these
principles
were
hitherto
unknown
for
they
were
all
understood
in
various
ways
not
only
by
the
hindus
but
by
many
europeans
yet
the
compact
presentation
of
the
sevenfold
constitution
of
man
in
intimate
connection
with
the
septenary
constitution
of
a
chain
of
globes
through
which
the
being
evolves
had
not
been
given
out
the
french
abbé
eliphas
levi
wrote
about
the
astral
realm
and
the
astral
body
but
evidently
had
no
knowledge
of
the
remainder
of
the
doctrine
and
while
the
hindus
possessed
the
other
terms
in
their
language
and
philosophy
they
did
not
use
a
septenary
classification
but
depended
chiefly
on
a
fourfold
one
and
certainly
concealed
if
they
knew
of
it
the
doctrine
of
a
chain
of
seven
globes
including
our
earth
indeed
a
learned
hindu
subba
row
now
deceased
asserted
that
they
knew
of
a
sevenfold
classification
but
that
it
had
not
been
and
would
not
be
given
out
considering
these
constituents
in
another
manner
we
would
say
that
the
lower
man
is
a
composite
being
but
in
his
real
nature
is
a
unity
or
immortal
being
comprising
a
trinity
of
spirit
discernment
and
mind
which
requires
four
lower
mortal
instruments
or
vehicles
through
which
to
work
in
matter
and
obtain
experience
from
nature
this
trinity
is
that
called
in
sanscrit
difficult
terms
to
render
in
english
is
spirit
is
the
highest
power
of
intellection
that
which
discerns
and
judges
and
is
mind
this
threefold
collection
is
the
real
man
and
beyond
doubt
the
doctrine
is
the
origin
of
the
theological
one
of
the
trinity
of
father
son
and
holy
ghost
the
four
lower
instruments
or
vehicles
are
shown
in
this
table
the
passions
and
desires
life
principle
astral
body
physical
body
these
four
lower
material
constituents
are
transitory
and
subject
to
disintegration
in
themselves
as
well
as
to
separation
from
each
other
when
the
hour
arrives
for
their
separation
to
begin
the
combination
can
no
longer
be
kept
up
the
physical
body
dies
the
atoms
of
which
each
of
the
four
is
composed
begin
to
separate
from
each
other
and
the
whole
collection
being
disjointed
is
no
longer
fit
for
one
as
an
instrument
for
the
real
man
this
is
what
is
called
death
among
us
mortals
but
it
is
not
death
for
the
real
man
because
he
is
deathless
persistent
immortal
he
is
therefore
called
the
triad
or
indestructible
trinity
while
they
are
known
as
the
quaternary
or
mortal
four
this
quaternary
or
lower
man
is
a
product
of
cosmic
or
physical
laws
and
substance
it
has
been
evolved
during
a
lapse
of
ages
like
any
other
physical
thing
from
cosmic
substance
and
is
therefore
subject
to
physical
physiological
and
psychical
laws
which
govern
the
race
of
man
as
a
whole
hence
its
period
of
possible
continuance
can
be
calculated
just
as
the
limit
of
tensile
strain
among
the
metals
used
in
bridge
building
can
be
deduced
by
the
engineer
any
one
collection
in
the
form
of
man
made
up
of
these
constituents
is
therefore
limited
in
duration
by
the
laws
of
the
evolutionary
period
in
which
it
exists
just
now
that
is
generally
seventy
to
one
hundred
years
but
its
possible
duration
is
longer
thus
there
are
in
history
instances
where
ordinary
persons
have
lived
to
be
two
hundred
years
of
age
and
by
a
knowledge
of
the
occult
laws
of
nature
the
possible
limit
of
duration
may
be
extended
nearly
to
four
hundred
years

the

and

the

man
is

called
or
it
will
be
seen
that
the
physical
part
of
our
nature
is
thus
extended
to
a
second
department
which
though
invisible
to
the
physical
eye
is
nevertheless
material
and
subject
to
decay
because
people
in
general
have
been
in
the
habit
of
admitting
to
be
real
only
what
they
can
see
with
the
physical
eye
they
have
at
last
come
to
suppose
that
the
unseen
is
neither
real
nor
material
but
they
forget
that
even
on
the
earth
plane
noxious
gases
are
invisible
though
real
and
powerfully
material
and
that
water
may
exist
in
the
air
held
suspended
and
invisible
until
conditions
alter
and
cause
its
precipitation
let
us
recapitulate
before
going
into
details
the
is
the
trinity
of
or
spirit
and
mind
and
he
uses
certain
agents
and
instruments
to
get
in
touch
with
nature
in
order
to
know
himself
these
instruments
and
agents
are
found
in
the
lower
the
principle
in
which
category
is
of
itself
an
instrument
for
the
particular
experience
belonging
to
its
own
field
the
body
being
the
lowest
least
important
and
most
transitory
of
the
whole
series
for
when
we
arrive
at
the
body
on
the
way
down
from
the
higher
mind
it
can
be
shown
that
all
of
its
organs
are
in
themselves
senseless
and
useless
when
deprived
of
the
man
within
sight
hearing
touch
taste
and
smelling
do
not
pertain
to
the
body
but
to
the
second
unseen
physical
man
the
real
organs
for
the
exercise
of
those
powers
being
in
the
astral
body
and
those
in
the
physical

inside
chapter
the
body
as
a
mass
of
flesh
bones
muscles
nerves
brain
matter
bile
mucous
blood
and
skin
is
an
object
of
exclusive
care
for
too
many
people
who
make
it
their
god
because
they
have
come
to
identify
themselves
with
it
meaning
it
only
when
they
say
left
to
itself
it
is
devoid
of
sense
and
acts
in
such
a
case
solely
by
reflex
and
automatic
action
this
we
see
in
sleep
for
then
the
body
assumes
attitudes
and
makes
motions
which
the
waking
man
does
not
permit
it
is
like
mother
earth
in
that
it
is
made
up
of
an
infinitesimal
number
of
lives
each
of
these
lives
is
a
sensitive
point
not
only
are
there
microbes
bacilli
and
bacteria
but
these
are
composed
of
others
and
those
others
of
still
more
minute
lives
these
lives
are
not
the
cells
of
the
body
but
make
up
the
cells
keeping
ever
within
the
limits
assigned
by
evolution
to
the
cell
they
are
forever
whirling
and
moving
together
throughout
the
whole
body
being
in
certain
apparently
void
spaces
as
well
as
where
flesh
membrane
bones
and
blood
are
seen
they
extend
too
beyond
the
actual
outer
limits
of
the
body
to
a
measurable
distance
one
of
the
mysteries
of
physical
life
is
hidden
among
these
lives
their
action
forced
forward
by
the
life
or
explain
active
existence
and
physical
death
they
are
divided
into
two
classes
one
the
destroyers
the
other
the
preservers
and
these
two
war
upon
each
other
from
birth
until
the
destroyers
win
in
this
struggle
the
life
energy
itself
ends
the
contest
because
it
is
life
that
kills
this
may
seem
heterodox
but
in
theosophical
philosophy
it
is
held
to
be
the
fact
for
it
is
said
the
infant
lives
because
the
combination
of
healthy
organs
is
able
to
absorb
the
life
all
around
it
in
space
and
is
put
to
sleep
each
day
by
the
overpowering
strength
of
the
stream
of
life
since
the
preservers
among
the
cells
of
the
youthful
body
are
not
yet
mastered
by
the
other
class
these
processes
of
going
to
sleep
and
waking
again
are
simply
and
solely
the
restoring
of
the
equilibrium
in
sleep
and
the
action
produced
by
disturbing
it
when
awake
it
may
be
compared
with
the
light
wherein
the
brilliant
arc
of
light
at
the
point
of
resistance
is
the
symbol
of
the
waking
active
man
so
in
sleep
we
are
again
absorbing
and
not
resisting
the
life
energy
when
we
wake
we
are
throwing
it
off
but
as
it
exists
around
us
like
an
ocean
in
which
we
swim
our
power
to
throw
it
off
is
necessarily
limited
just
when
we
wake
we
are
in
equilibrium
as
to
our
organs
and
life
when
we
fall
asleep
we
are
yet
more
full
of
life
than
in
the
morning
it
has
exhausted
us
it
finally
kills
the
body
such
a
contest
could
not
be
waged
forever
since
the
whole
solar
system
s
weight
of
life
is
pitted
against
the
power
to
resist
focussed
in
one
small
human
frame
the
body
is
considered
by
the
masters
of
wisdom
to
be
the
most
transitory
impermanent
and
illusionary
of
the
whole
series
of
constituents
in
man
not
for
a
moment
is
it
the
same
ever
changing
in
motion
in
every
part
it
is
in
fact
never
complete
or
finished
though
tangible
the
ancients
clearly
perceived
this
for
they
elaborated
a
doctrine
called
naimittika
pralaya
or
the
continual
change
in
material
things
the
continual
destruction
this
is
known
now
to
science
in
the
doctrine
that
the
body
undergoes
a
complete
alteration
and
renovation
every
seven
years
at
the
end
of
the
first
seven
years
it
is
not
the
same
body
it
was
in
the
beginning
at
the
end
of
our
days
it
has
changed
seven
times
perhaps
more
and
yet
it
presents
the
same
general
appearance
from
maturity
until
death
and
it
is
a
human
form
from
birth
to
maturity
this
is
a
mystery
science
explains
not
it
is
a
question
pertaining
to
the
cell
and
to
the
means
whereby
the
general
human
shape
is
preserved
the
cell
is
an
illusion
it
is
merely
a
word
it
has
no
existence
as
a
material
thing
for
any
cell
is
composed
of
other
cells
what
then
is
a
cell
it
is
the
ideal
form
within
which
the
actual
physical
up
of
the
lives
themselves
as
it
is
admitted
that
the
physical
molecules
are
forever
rushing
away
from
the
body
they
must
be
leaving
the
cells
each
moment
hence
there
is
no
physical
cell
but
the
privative
limits
of
one
the
ideal
walls
and
general
shape
the
molecules
assume
position
within
the
ideal
shape
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
and
leave
it
again
almost
at
once
to
give
place
to
other
atoms
and
as
it
is
thus
with
the
body
so
is
it
with
the
earth
and
with
the
solar
system
thus
also
is
it
though
in
slower
measure
with
all
material
objects
they
are
all
in
constant
motion
and
change
this
is
modern
and
also
ancient
wisdom
this
is
the
physical
explanation
of
clairvoyance
clairaudience
telepathy
and
it
helps
to
show
us
what
a
deluding
and
unsatisfactory
thing
our
body
is
although
strictly
speaking
the
second
constituent
of
man
is
the
astral
in
sanscrit
will
consider
life
and
in
because
to
our
observation
the
phenomenon
of
life
is
more
plainly
exhibited
in
connection
with
the
body
life
is
not
the
result
of
the
operation
of
the
organs
nor
is
it
gone
when
the
body
dissolves
it
is
a
universally
pervasive
principle
it
is
the
ocean
in
which
the
earth
floats
it
permeates
the
globe
and
every
being
and
object
on
it
it
works
unceasingly
on
and
around
us
pulsating
against
and
through
us
forever
when
we
occupy
a
body
we
merely
use
a
more
specialized
instrument
than
any
other
for
dealing
with
both
and
strictly
speaking
is
breath
and
as
breath
is
necessary
for
continuance
of
life
in
the
human
machine
that
is
the
better
word
means
life
and
also
is
applied
to
the
living
soul
for
the
life
in
general
is
derived
from
the
supreme
life
itself
is
therefore
capable
of
general
application
whereas
is
more
particular
it
can
not
be
said
that
one
has
a
definite
amount
of
this
life
energy
which
will
fly
back
to
its
source
should
the
body
be
burned
but
rather
that
it
works
with
whatever
be
the
mass
of
matter
in
it
we
as
it
were
secrete
or
use
it
as
we
live
for
whether
we
are
alive
or
dead
is
still
there
in
life
among
our
organs
sustaining
them
in
death
among
the
innumerable
creatures
that
arise
from
our
destruction
we
can
no
more
do
away
with
this
life
than
we
can
erase
the
air
in
which
the
bird
floats
and
like
the
air
it
fills
all
the
spaces
on
the
planet
so
that
nowhere
can
we
lose
the
benefit
of
it
nor
escape
its
final
crushing
power
but
in
working
upon
the
physical
body
this
a
vehicle
means
or
guide
and
this
vehicle
is
the
astral
body
there
are
many
names
for
the
astral
body
here
are
a
few
sanscrit
meaning
design
body
and
the
best
one
of
all
ethereal
double
phantom
wraith
apparition
doppelgänger
personal
man
perisprit
irrational
soul
animal
soul
elementary
spook
devil
demon
some
of
these
apply
only
to
the
astral
body
when
devoid
of
the
corpus
after
death
devil
and
elementary
are
nearly
synonymous
the
first
sanscrit
the
other
english
with
the
hindus
the
is
the
astral
body
when
it
is
by
death
released
from
the
body
and
the
mind
and
being
thus
separated
from
conscience
is
a
devil
in
their
estimation
they
are
not
far
wrong
if
we
abolish
the
old
notion
that
a
devil
is
an
angel
fallen
from
heaven
for
this
bodily
devil
is
something
which
rises
from
the
earth
it
may
be
objected
that
the
term
astral
body
is
not
the
right
one
for
this
purpose
the
objection
is
one
which
arises
from
the
nature
and
genesis
of
the
english
language
for
as
that
has
grown
up
in
a
struggle
with
nature
and
among
a
commercial
people
it
has
not
as
yet
coined
the
words
needed
for
designating
the
great
range
of
faculties
and
organs
of
the
unseen
man
and
as
its
philosophers
have
not
admitted
the
existence
of
these
inner
organs
the
right
terms
do
not
exist
in
the
language
so
in
looking
for
words
to
describe
the
inner
body
the
only
ones
found
in
english
were
the
astral
body
this
term
comes
near
to
the
real
fact
since
the
substance
of
this
form
is
derived
from
cosmic
matter
or
star
matter
roughly
speaking
but
the
old
sanscrit
word
describes
it
the
design
it
is
the
design
or
model
for
the
physical
body
this
is
better
than
ethereal
body
as
the
latter
might
be
said
to
be
subsequent
to
the
physical
whereas
in
fact
the
astral
body
precedes
the
material
one
the
astral
body
is
made
of
matter
of
very
fine
texture
as
compared
with
the
visible
body
and
has
a
great
tensile
strength
so
that
it
changes
but
little
during
a
lifetime
while
the
physical
alters
every
moment
and
not
only
has
it
this
immense
strength
but
at
the
same
time
possesses
an
elasticity
permitting
its
extension
to
a
considerable
distance
it
is
flexible
plastic
extensible
and
strong
the
matter
of
which
it
is
composed
is
electrical
and
magnetic
in
its
essence
and
is
just
what
the
whole
world
was
composed
of
in
the
dim
past
when
the
processes
of
evolution
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
point
of
producing
the
material
body
for
man
but
it
is
not
raw
or
crude
matter
having
been
through
a
vast
period
of
evolution
and
undergone
purifying
processes
of
an
incalculable
number
its
nature
has
been
refined
to
a
degree
far
beyond
the
gross
physical
elements
we
see
and
touch
with
the
physical
eye
and
hand
the
astral
body
is
the
guiding
model
for
the
physical
one
and
all
the
other
kingdoms
have
the
same
astral
model
vegetables
minerals
and
animals
have
the
ethereal
double
and
this
theory
is
the
only
one
which
will
answer
the
question
how
it
is
that
the
seed
produces
its
own
kind
and
all
sentient
beings
bring
forth
their
like
biologists
can
only
say
that
the
facts
are
as
we
know
them
but
can
give
no
reason
why
the
acorn
will
never
grow
anything
but
an
oak
except
that
no
man
ever
knew
it
to
be
otherwise
but
in
the
old
schools
of
the
past
the
true
doctrine
was
known
and
it
has
been
once
again
brought
out
in
the
west
through
the
efforts
of
blavatsky
and
those
who
have
found
inspiration
in
her
works
this
doctrine
is
that
in
early
times
of
the
evolution
of
this
globe
the
various
kingdoms
of
nature
are
outlined
in
plan
or
ideal
form
first
and
then
the
astral
matter
begins
to
work
on
this
plan
with
the
aid
of
the
life
principle
until
after
long
ages
the
astral
human
form
is
evolved
and
perfected
this
is
then
the
first
form
that
the
human
race
had
and
corresponds
in
a
way
with
the
allegory
of
man
s
state
in
the
garden
of
eden
after
another
long
period
during
which
the
cycle
of
further
descent
into
matter
is
rolling
forward
the
astral
form
at
last
clothes
itself
with
a
coat
of
skin
and
the
present
physical
form
is
on
the
scene
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
verse
of
the
book
of
genesis
which
describes
the
giving
of
coats
of
skin
to
adam
and
eve
it
is
the
final
fall
into
matter
for
from
that
point
on
the
man
within
strives
to
raise
the
whole
mass
of
physical
substance
up
to
a
higher
level
and
to
inform
it
all
with
a
larger
measure
of
spiritual
influence
so
that
it
may
be
ready
to
go
still
further
on
during
the
next
great
period
of
evolution
after
the
present
one
is
ended
so
at
the
present
time
the
model
for
the
growing
child
in
the
womb
is
the
astral
body
already
perfect
in
shape
before
the
child
is
born
it
is
on
this
the
molecules
arrange
themselves
until
the
child
is
complete
and
the
presence
of
the
ethereal
will
explain
how
the
form
grows
into
shape
how
the
eyes
push
themselves
out
from
within
to
the
surface
of
the
face
and
many
other
mysterious
matters
in
embryology
which
are
passed
over
by
medical
men
with
a
description
but
with
no
explanation
this
will
also
explain
as
nothing
else
can
the
cases
of
marking
of
the
child
in
the
womb
sometimes
denied
by
physicians
but
by
those
who
care
to
watch
to
be
a
fact
of
frequent
occurrence
the
growing
physical
form
is
subject
to
the
astral
model
it
is
connected
with
the
imagination
of
the
mother
by
physical
and
psychical
organs
the
mother
makes
a
strong
picture
from
horror
fear
or
otherwise
and
the
astral
model
is
then
similarly
affected
in
the
case
of
marking
by
being
born
legless
the
ideas
and
strong
imagination
of
the
mother
act
so
as
to
cut
off
or
shrivel
up
the
astral
leg
and
the
result
is
that
the
molecules
having
no
model
of
leg
to
work
on
make
no
physical
leg
whatever
and
similarly
in
all
such
cases
but
where
we
find
a
man
who
still
feels
the
leg
which
the
surgeon
has
cut
off
or
perceives
the
fingers
that
were
amputated
then
the
astral
member
has
not
been
interfered
with
and
hence
the
man
feels
as
if
it
were
still
on
his
person
for
knife
or
acid
will
not
injure
the
astral
model
but
in
the
first
stages
of
its
growth
ideas
and
imagination
have
the
power
of
acid
and
sharpened
steel
in
the
ordinary
man
who
has
not
been
trained
in
practical
occultism
or
who
has
not
the
faculty
by
birth
the
astral
body
can
not
go
more
than
a
few
feet
from
the
physical
one
it
is
a
part
of
that
physical
it
sustains
it
and
is
incorporated
in
it
just
as
the
fibres
of
the
mango
are
all
through
that
fruit
but
there
are
those
who
by
reason
of
practices
pursued
in
former
lives
on
the
earth
have
a
power
born
with
them
of
unconsciously
sending
out
the
astral
body
these
are
mediums
some
seers
and
many
hysterical
cataleptic
and
scrofulous
people
those
who
have
trained
themselves
by
a
long
course
of
excessively
hard
discipline
which
reaches
to
the
moral
and
mental
nature
and
quite
beyond
the
power
of
the
average
man
of
the
day
can
use
the
astral
form
at
will
for
they
have
gotten
completely
over
the
delusion
that
the
physical
body
is
a
permanent
part
of
them
and
besides
they
have
learned
the
chemical
and
electrical
laws
governing
in
this
matter
in
their
case
they
act
with
knowledge
and
consciously
in
the
other
cases
the
act
is
done
without
power
to
prevent
it
or
to
bring
it
about
at
will
or
to
avoid
the
risks
attendant
on
such
use
of
potencies
in
nature
of
a
high
character
the
astral
body
has
in
it
the
real
organs
of
the
outer
sense
organs
in
it
are
the
sight
hearing
power
to
smell
and
the
sense
of
touch
it
has
a
complete
system
of
nerves
and
arteries
of
its
own
for
the
conveyance
of
the
astral
fluid
which
is
to
that
body
as
our
blood
is
to
the
physical
it
is
the
real
personal
man
there
are
located
the
subconscious
perception
and
the
latent
memory
which
the
hypnotizers
of
the
day
are
dealing
with
and
being
baffled
by
so
when
the
body
dies
the
astral
man
is
released
and
as
at
death
the
immortal
away
to
another
state
the
astral
becomes
a
shell
of
the
once
living
man
and
requires
time
to
dissipate
it
retains
all
the
memories
of
the
life
lived
by
the
man
and
thus
reflexly
and
automatically
can
repeat
what
the
dead
man
knew
said
thought
and
saw
it
remains
near
the
deserted
physical
body
nearly
all
the
time
until
that
is
completely
dissipated
for
it
has
to
go
through
its
own
process
of
dying
it
may
become
visible
under
certain
conditions
it
is
the
spook
of
the
spiritualistic
rooms
and
is
there
made
to
masquerade
as
the
real
spirit
of
this
or
that
individual
attracted
by
the
thoughts
of
the
medium
and
the
sitters
it
vaguely
flutters
where
they
are
and
then
is
galvanized
into
a
factitious
life
by
a
whole
host
of
elemental
forces
and
by
the
active
astral
body
of
the
medium
who
is
holding
the
or
of
any
other
medium
in
the
audience
from
it
as
from
a
photograph
are
then
reflected
into
the
medium
s
brain
all
the
boasted
evidences
which
spiritualists
claim
go
to
prove
identity
of
deceased
friend
or
relative
these
evidences
are
accepted
as
proof
that
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
is
present
because
neither
mediums
nor
sitters
are
acquainted
with
the
laws
governing
their
own
nature
nor
with
the
constitution
power
and
function
of
astral
matter
and
astral
man
the
theosophical
philosophy
does
not
deny
the
facts
proven
in
spiritualistic
but
it
gives
an
explanation
of
them
wholly
opposed
to
that
of
the
spiritualists
and
surely
the
utter
absence
of
any
logical
scientific
explanation
by
these
spirits
of
the
phenomena
they
are
said
to
produce
supports
the
contention
that
they
have
no
knowledge
to
impart
they
can
merely
cause
certain
phenomena
the
examination
of
those
and
deductions
therefrom
can
only
be
properly
carried
on
by
a
trained
brain
guided
by
a
living
trinity
of
spirit
soul
and
mind
and
here
another
class
of
spiritualistic
phenomena
requires
brief
notice
that
is
the
appearance
of
what
is
called
a
materialized
spirit
three
explanations
are
offered
that
the
astral
body
of
the
living
medium
detaches
itself
from
its
corpus
and
assumes
the
appearance
of
the
spirit
for
one
of
the
properties
of
the
astral
matter
is
capacity
to
reflect
an
image
existing
unseen
in
ether
the
actual
astral
shell
of
the
devoid
of
his
or
her
spirit
and
visible
and
tangible
when
the
condition
of
air
and
ether
is
such
as
to
so
alter
the
vibration
of
the
molecules
of
the
astral
shell
that
it
may
become
visible
the
phenomena
of
density
and
apparent
weight
are
explained
by
other
laws
an
unseen
mass
of
electrical
and
magnetic
matter
is
collected
and
upon
it
is
reflected
out
of
the
astral
light
a
picture
of
any
desired
person
either
dead
or
living
this
is
taken
to
be
the
spirit
of
such
persons
but
it
is
not
and
has
been
justly
called
by
blavatsky
a
psychological
fraud
because
it
pretends
to
be
what
it
is
not
and
strange
to
say
this
very
explanation
of
materializations
has
been
given
by
a
spirit
at
a
regular
but
has
never
been
accepted
by
the
spiritualists
just
because
it
upsets
their
notion
of
the
return
of
the
spirits
of
deceased
persons
finally
the
astral
body
will
explain
nearly
all
the
strange
psychical
things
happening
in
daily
life
and
in
dealings
with
genuine
mediums
it
shows
what
an
apparition
may
be
and
the
possibility
of
such
being
seen
and
thus
prevents
the
scientific
doubter
from
violating
good
sense
by
asserting
you
did
not
see
what
you
know
you
have
seen
it
removes
superstition
by
showing
the
real
nature
of
these
phenomena
and
destroys
the
unreasonable
fear
of
the
unknown
which
makes
a
man
afraid
to
see
a
ghost
by
it
also
we
can
explain
the
apportation
of
objects
without
physical
contact
for
the
astral
hand
may
be
extruded
and
made
to
take
hold
of
an
object
drawing
it
in
toward
the
body
when
this
is
shown
to
be
possible
then
travelers
will
not
be
laughed
at
who
tell
of
seeing
the
hindu
yogee
make
coffee
cups
fly
through
the
air
and
distant
objects
approach
apparently
of
their
own
accord
untouched
by
him
or
any
one
else
all
the
instances
of
clairvoyance
and
clairaudience
are
to
be
explained
also
by
the
astral
body
and
astral
light
the
are
the
do
the
seeing
and
the
hearing
and
as
all
material
objects
are
constantly
in
motion
among
their
own
atoms
the
astral
sight
and
hearing
are
not
impeded
but
work
at
a
distance
as
great
as
the
extension
of
the
astral
light
or
matter
around
and
about
the
earth
thus
it
was
that
the
great
seer
swedenborg
saw
houses
burning
in
the
city
of
stockholm
when
he
was
at
another
city
many
miles
off
and
by
the
same
means
any
clairvoyant
of
the
day
sees
and
hears
at
a
distance
chapter
vi
the
author
of
book
ought
to
be
consulted
by
all
students
of
theosophy
since
it
was
made
from
suggestions
given
by
some
of
the
adepts
the
name
to
the
fourth
principle
of
man
s
constitution
the
reason
was
that
the
word
in
the
sanscrit
language
means
desire
and
as
the
idea
intended
to
be
conveyed
was
that
the
fourth
principle
was
the
body
or
mass
of
desires
and
passions
sinnett
added
the
sanscrit
word
for
body
or
form
which
is
thus
making
the
compound
word
i
shall
call
it
by
the
english
and
those
terms
exactly
express
its
nature
and
i
do
this
also
in
order
to
make
the
sharp
issue
which
actually
exists
between
the
psychology
and
mental
philosophy
of
the
west
and
those
of
the
east
the
west
divides
man
into
intellect
will
and
feeling
but
it
is
not
understood
whether
the
passions
and
desires
constitute
a
principle
in
themselves
or
are
due
entirely
to
the
body
indeed
most
people
consider
them
as
being
the
result
of
the
influence
of
the
flesh
for
they
are
designated
often
by
the
terms
desires
of
the
flesh
and
fleshly
appetites
the
ancients
however
and
the
theosophists
know
them
to
be
a
principle
in
themselves
and
not
merely
the
impulses
from
the
body
there
is
no
help
to
be
had
in
this
matter
from
the
western
psychology
now
in
its
infancy
and
wholly
devoid
of
knowledge
about
the
inner
which
is
the
psychical
nature
of
man
and
from
this
point
there
is
the
greatest
divergence
between
it
and
theosophy
the
passions
and
desires
are
not
produced
by
the
body
but
on
the
contrary
the
body
is
caused
to
be
by
the
former
it
is
desire
and
passion
which
caused
us
to
be
born
and
will
bring
us
to
birth
again
and
again
in
this
body
or
in
some
other
it
is
by
passion
and
desire
we
are
made
to
evolve
through
the
mansions
of
death
called
lives
on
earth
it
was
by
the
arising
of
desire
in
the
unknown
first
cause
the
one
absolute
existence
that
the
whole
collection
of
worlds
was
manifested
and
by
means
of
the
influence
of
desire
in
the
now
manifested
world
is
the
latter
kept
in
existence
this
fourth
principle
is
the
balance
principle
of
the
whole
seven
it
stands
in
the
middle
and
from
it
the
ways
go
up
or
down
it
is
the
basis
of
action
and
the
mover
of
the
will
as
the
old
hermetists
say
behind
will
stands
for
whether
we
wish
to
do
well
or
ill
we
have
to
first
arouse
within
us
the
desire
for
either
course
the
good
man
who
at
last
becomes
even
a
sage
had
at
one
time
in
his
many
lives
to
arouse
the
desire
for
the
company
of
holy
men
and
to
keep
his
desire
for
progress
alive
in
order
to
continue
on
his
way
even
a
buddha
or
a
jesus
had
first
to
make
a
vow
which
is
a
desire
in
some
life
that
he
would
save
the
world
or
some
part
of
it
and
to
persevere
with
the
desire
alive
in
his
heart
through
countless
lives
and
equally
so
on
the
other
hand
the
bad
man
life
after
life
took
unto
himself
low
selfish
wicked
desires
thus
debasing
instead
of
purifying
this
principle
on
the
material
and
scientific
side
of
occultism
use
of
the
inner
hidden
powers
of
our
this
principle
of
desire
be
not
strong
the
master
power
of
imagination
can
not
do
its
work
because
though
it
makes
a
mould
or
matrix
the
will
can
not
act
unless
it
is
moved
directed
and
kept
up
to
pitch
by
desire
the
desires
and
passions
therefore
have
two
aspects
the
one
being
low
and
the
other
high
the
low
is
that
shown
by
the
constant
placing
of
the
consciousness
entirely
below
in
the
body
and
the
astral
body
the
high
comes
from
the
influence
of
and
aspiration
to
the
trinity
above
of
mind
buddhi
and
spirit
this
fourth
principle
is
like
the
sign
libra
in
the
path
of
the
sun
through
the
zodiac
when
the
sun
who
is
the
real
man
reaches
that
sign
he
trembles
in
the
balance
should
he
go
back
the
worlds
would
be
destroyed
he
goes
onward
and
the
whole
human
race
is
lifted
up
to
perfection
during
life
the
emplacement
of
the
desires
and
passions
is
as
obtains
with
the
astral
body
throughout
the
entire
lower
man
and
like
that
ethereal
counterpart
of
our
physical
person
it
may
be
added
to
or
diminished
made
weak
or
increased
in
strength
debased
or
purified
at
death
it
informs
the
astral
body
which
then
becomes
a
mere
shell
for
when
a
man
dies
his
astral
body
and
principle
of
passion
and
desire
leave
the
physical
in
company
and
coalesce
it
is
then
that
the
term
may
be
applied
as
is
really
made
of
astral
body
and
in
conjunction
and
this
joining
of
the
two
makes
a
shape
or
form
which
though
ordinarily
invisible
is
material
and
may
be
brought
into
visibility
although
it
is
empty
of
mind
and
conscience
it
has
powers
of
its
own
that
can
be
exercised
whenever
the
conditions
permit
these
conditions
are
furnished
by
the
medium
of
the
spiritualists
and
in
every
room
the
astral
shells
of
deceased
persons
are
always
present
to
delude
the
sitters
whose
powers
of
discrimination
have
been
destroyed
by
wonderment
it
is
the
devil
of
the
hindus
and
a
worse
enemy
the
poor
medium
could
not
have
for
the
astral
but
the
mass
of
the
desires
and
passions
abandoned
by
the
real
person
who
has
fled
to
heaven
and
has
no
concern
with
the
people
left
behind
least
of
all
with
and
mediums
hence
being
devoid
of
the
nobler
soul
these
desires
and
passions
work
only
on
the
very
lowest
part
of
the
medium
s
nature
and
stir
up
no
good
elements
but
always
the
lower
leanings
of
the
being
therefore
it
is
that
even
the
spiritualists
themselves
admit
that
in
the
ranks
of
the
mediums
there
is
much
fraud
and
mediums
have
often
confessed
the
spirits
did
tempt
me
and
i
committed
fraud
at
their
this
spook
is
also
the
enemy
of
our
civilization
which
permits
us
to
execute
men
for
crimes
committed
and
thus
throw
out
into
the
ether
the
mass
of
passion
and
desire
free
from
the
weight
of
the
body
and
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
attracted
to
any
sensitive
person
being
thus
attracted
the
deplorable
images
of
crimes
committed
and
also
the
picture
of
the
execution
and
all
the
accompanying
curses
and
wishes
for
revenge
are
implanted
in
living
persons
who
not
seeing
the
evil
are
unable
to
throw
it
off
thus
crimes
and
new
ideas
of
crimes
are
wilfully
propagated
every
day
by
those
countries
where
capital
punishment
prevails
the
astral
shells
together
with
the
still
living
astral
body
of
the
medium
helped
by
certain
forces
of
nature
which
the
theosophists
call
elementals
produce
nearly
all
the
phenomena
of
spiritualism
the
medium
s
astral
body
having
the
power
of
extension
and
extrusion
forms
the
framework
for
what
are
called
materialized
spirits
makes
objects
move
without
physical
contact
gives
reports
from
deceased
relatives
none
of
them
anything
more
than
recollections
and
pictures
from
the
astral
light
and
in
all
this
using
and
being
used
by
the
shells
of
suicides
executed
murderers
and
all
such
spooks
as
are
naturally
near
to
this
plane
of
life
the
number
of
cases
in
which
any
communication
comes
from
an
actual
spirit
out
of
the
body
is
so
small
as
to
be
countable
almost
on
one
hand
but
the
spirits
of
living
men
sometimes
while
their
bodies
are
asleep
come
to
and
take
part
therein
but
they
can
not
recollect
it
do
not
know
how
they
do
it
and
are
not
distinguished
by
mediums
from
the
mass
of
astral
corpses
the
fact
that
such
things
can
be
done
by
the
inner
man
and
not
be
recollected
proves
nothing
against
these
theories
for
the
child
can
see
without
knowing
how
the
eye
acts
and
the
savage
who
has
no
knowledge
of
the
complex
machinery
working
in
his
body
still
carries
on
the
process
of
digestion
perfectly
and
that
the
latter
is
unconscious
with
him
is
exactly
in
line
with
the
theory
for
these
acts
and
doings
of
the
inner
man
are
the
unconscious
actions
of
the
subconscious
mind
these
words
conscious
and
subconscious
are
of
course
used
relatively
the
unconsciousness
being
that
of
the
brain
only
and
hypnotic
experiments
have
conclusively
proved
all
these
theories
as
on
one
day
not
far
away
will
be
fully
admitted
besides
this
the
astral
shells
of
suicides
and
executed
criminals
are
the
most
coherent
longest
lived
and
nearest
to
us
of
all
the
shades
of
hades
and
hence
must
out
of
the
necessity
of
the
case
be
the
real
controls
of
the
room
passion
and
desire
together
with
astral
are
common
to
men
and
animals
as
also
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
though
in
the
last
but
faintly
developed
and
at
one
period
in
evolution
no
further
material
principles
had
been
developed
and
all
the
three
higher
of
mind
soul
and
spirit
were
but
latent
up
to
this
point
man
and
animal
were
equal
for
the
brute
in
us
is
made
of
the
passions
and
the
astral
body
the
development
of
the
germs
of
mind
made
man
because
it
constituted
the
great
differentiation
the
god
within
begins
with
or
mind
and
it
is
the
struggle
between
this
god
and
the
brute
below
which
theosophy
speaks
of
and
warns
about
the
lower
principle
is
called
bad
because
by
comparison
with
the
higher
it
is
so
but
still
it
is
the
basis
of
action
we
can
not
rise
unless
self
first
asserts
itself
in
the
desire
to
do
better
in
this
aspect
it
is
called
or
the
active
and
bad
quality
as
distinguished
from
or
the
quality
of
darkness
and
indifference
rising
is
not
possible
unless
is
present
to
give
the
impulse
and
by
the
use
of
this
principle
of
passion
all
the
higher
qualities
are
brought
to
at
last
so
refine
and
elevate
our
desires
that
they
may
be
continually
placed
upon
truth
and
spirit
by
this
theosophy
does
not
teach
that
the
passions
are
to
be
pandered
to
or
satiated
for
a
more
pernicious
doctrine
was
never
taught
but
the
injunction
is
to
make
use
of
the
activity
given
by
the
fourth
principle
so
as
to
ever
rise
and
not
to
fall
under
the
dominion
of
the
dark
quality
that
ends
with
annihilation
after
having
begun
in
selfishness
and
indifference
having
thus
gone
over
the
field
and
shown
what
are
the
lower
principles
we
find
theosophy
teaching
that
at
the
present
point
of
man
s
evolution
he
is
a
fully
developed
quaternary
with
the
higher
principles
partly
developed
hence
it
is
taught
that
man
shows
himself
to
be
moved
by
passion
and
desire
this
is
proved
by
a
glance
at
the
civilizations
of
the
earth
for
they
are
all
moved
by
this
principle
and
in
countries
like
france
england
and
america
a
glorification
of
it
is
exhibited
in
the
attention
to
display
to
sensuous
art
to
struggle
for
power
and
place
and
in
all
the
habits
and
modes
of
living
where
the
gratification
of
the
senses
is
sometimes
esteemed
the
highest
good
but
as
mind
is
being
evolved
more
and
more
as
we
proceed
in
our
course
along
the
line
of
the
race
development
there
can
be
perceived
underneath
in
all
countries
the
beginning
of
the
transition
from
the
animal
possessed
of
the
germ
of
real
mind
to
the
man
of
mind
complete
this
day
is
therefore
known
to
the
masters
who
have
given
out
some
of
the
old
truths
as
the
transition
period
proud
science
and
prouder
religion
do
not
admit
this
but
think
we
are
as
we
always
will
be
but
believing
in
his
teacher
the
theosophist
sees
all
around
him
the
evidence
that
the
race
mind
is
changing
by
enlargement
that
the
old
days
of
dogmatism
are
gone
and
the
age
of
inquiry
has
come
that
the
inquiries
will
grow
louder
year
by
year
and
the
answers
be
required
to
satisfy
the
mind
as
it
grows
more
and
more
until
at
last
all
dogmatism
being
ended
the
race
will
be
ready
to
face
all
problems
each
man
for
himself
all
working
for
the
good
of
the
whole
and
that
the
end
will
be
the
perfecting
of
those
who
struggle
to
overcome
the
brute
for
these
reasons
the
old
doctrines
are
given
out
again
and
theosophy
asks
every
one
to
reflect
whether
to
give
way
to
the
animal
below
or
look
up
to
and
be
governed
by
the
god
within
a
fuller
treatment
of
the
fourth
principle
of
our
constitution
would
compel
us
to
consider
all
such
questions
as
those
presented
by
the
wonder
workers
of
the
east
by
spiritualistic
phenomena
hypnotism
apparitions
insanity
and
the
like
but
they
must
be
reserved
for
separate
handling
chapter
vii
in
our
analysis
of
man
s
nature
we
have
so
far
considered
only
the
perishable
elements
which
make
up
the
lower
man
and
have
arrived
at
the
fourth
principle
or
of
having
touched
upon
the
question
of
mind
but
even
so
far
as
we
have
gone
it
must
be
evident
that
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
ordinary
ideas
about
mind
and
those
found
in
theosophy
ordinarily
the
mind
is
thought
to
be
immaterial
or
to
be
merely
the
name
for
the
action
of
the
brain
in
evolving
thought
a
process
wholly
unknown
other
than
by
inference
or
that
if
there
be
no
brain
there
can
be
no
mind
a
good
deal
of
attention
has
been
paid
to
cataloguing
some
mental
functions
and
attributes
but
the
terms
are
altogether
absent
from
the
language
to
describe
actual
metaphysical
and
spiritual
facts
about
man
this
confusion
and
poverty
of
words
for
these
uses
are
due
almost
entirely
first
to
dogmatic
religion
which
has
asserted
and
enforced
for
many
centuries
dogmas
and
doctrines
which
reason
could
not
accept
and
secondly
to
the
natural
war
which
grew
up
between
science
and
religion
just
as
soon
as
the
fetters
placed
by
religion
upon
science
were
removed
and
the
latter
was
permitted
to
deal
with
facts
in
nature
the
reaction
against
religion
naturally
prevented
science
from
taking
any
but
a
materialistic
view
of
man
and
nature
so
from
neither
of
these
two
have
we
yet
gained
the
words
needed
for
describing
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
principles
those
which
make
up
the
trinity
the
real
man
the
immortal
pilgrim
the
fifth
principle
is
in
the
classification
adopted
by
sinnett
and
is
usually
translated
mind
other
names
have
been
given
to
it
but
it
is
the
knower
the
perceiver
the
thinker
the
sixth
is
or
spiritual
discernment
the
seventh
is
or
spirit
the
ray
from
the
absolute
being
the
english
language
will
suffice
to
describe
in
part
what
is
but
not
nor
and
will
leave
many
things
relating
to
undescribed
the
course
of
evolution
developed
the
lower
principles
and
produced
at
last
the
form
of
man
with
a
brain
of
better
and
deeper
capacity
than
that
of
any
other
animal
but
this
man
in
form
was
not
man
in
mind
and
needed
the
fifth
principle
the
thinking
perceiving
one
to
differentiate
him
from
the
animal
kingdom
and
to
confer
the
power
of
becoming
the
monad
was
imprisoned
in
these
forms
and
that
monad
is
composed
of
and
for
without
the
presence
of
the
monad
evolution
could
not
go
forward
going
back
for
a
moment
to
the
time
when
the
races
were
devoid
of
mind
the
question
arises
who
gave
the
mind
where
did
it
come
from
and
what
is
it
it
is
the
link
between
the
spirit
of
god
above
and
the
personal
below
it
was
given
to
the
mindless
monads
by
others
who
had
gone
all
through
this
process
ages
upon
ages
before
in
other
worlds
and
systems
of
worlds
and
it
therefore
came
from
other
evolutionary
periods
which
were
carried
out
and
completed
long
before
the
solar
system
had
begun
this
is
the
theory
strange
and
unacceptable
but
which
must
be
stated
if
we
are
to
tell
the
truth
about
theosophy
and
this
is
only
handing
on
what
others
have
said
before
the
manner
in
which
this
light
of
mind
was
given
to
the
mindless
men
can
be
understood
from
the
illustration
of
one
candle
lighting
many
given
one
lighted
candle
and
numerous
unlighted
ones
it
follows
that
from
one
light
the
others
may
also
be
set
aflame
so
in
the
case
of
it
is
the
candle
of
flame
the
mindless
men
having
four
elementary
principles
of
body
astral
body
life
and
desire
are
the
unlighted
candles
that
can
not
light
themselves
the
sons
of
wisdom
who
are
the
elder
brothers
of
every
family
of
men
on
any
globe
have
the
light
derived
by
them
from
others
who
reach
back
and
yet
farther
back
in
endless
procession
with
no
beginning
nor
end
they
set
fire
to
the
combined
lower
principles
and
the
monad
thus
lighting
up
in
the
new
men
and
preparing
another
great
race
for
final
initiation
this
lighting
up
of
the
fire
of
is
symbolized
in
all
great
religions
and
freemasonry
in
the
east
one
priest
appears
holding
a
candle
lighted
at
the
altar
and
thousands
of
others
light
their
candles
from
this
one
the
parsees
also
have
their
sacred
fire
which
is
lighted
from
some
other
sacred
flame
or
the
thinker
is
the
reïncarnating
being
the
immortal
who
carries
the
results
and
values
of
all
the
different
lives
lived
on
earth
or
elsewhere
its
nature
becomes
dual
as
soon
as
it
is
attached
to
a
body
for
the
human
brain
is
a
superior
organism
and
uses
it
to
reason
from
premises
to
conclusions
this
also
differentiates
man
from
animal
for
the
animal
acts
from
automatic
and
instinctual
impulses
whereas
the
man
can
use
reason
this
is
the
lower
aspect
of
the
thinker
or
and
not
as
some
have
supposed
the
highest
and
best
gift
belonging
to
man
its
other
and
in
theosophy
higher
aspect
is
the
intuitional
which
knows
and
does
not
depend
on
reason
the
lower
and
purely
intellectual
is
nearest
to
the
principle
of
desire
and
is
thus
distinguished
from
its
other
side
which
has
affinity
for
the
spiritual
principles
above
if
the
thinker
then
becomes
wholly
intellectual
the
entire
nature
begins
to
tend
downward
for
intellect
alone
is
cold
heartless
selfish
because
it
is
not
lighted
up
by
the
two
other
principles
of
and
in
the
thoughts
of
all
lives
are
stored
that
is
to
say
in
any
one
life
the
sum
total
of
thoughts
underlying
all
the
acts
of
the
will
be
of
one
character
in
general
but
may
be
placed
in
one
or
more
classes
that
is
the
business
man
of
is
a
single
type
his
entire
life
thoughts
represent
but
one
single
thread
of
thought
the
artist
is
another
the
man
who
has
engaged
in
business
but
also
thought
much
upon
fame
and
power
which
he
never
attained
is
still
another
the
great
mass
of
courageous
and
strong
poor
people
who
have
but
little
time
to
think
constitute
another
distinct
class
in
all
these
the
total
quantity
of
life
thoughts
makes
up
the
stream
or
thread
of
a
life
s
that
upon
which
the
heart
was
set
is
stored
in
to
be
brought
out
again
at
any
time
in
whatever
life
the
brain
and
bodily
environments
are
similar
to
those
used
in
engendering
that
class
of
thoughts
it
is
which
sees
the
objects
presented
to
it
by
the
bodily
organs
and
the
actual
organs
within
when
the
open
eye
receives
a
picture
on
the
retina
the
whole
scene
is
turned
into
vibrations
in
the
optic
nerves
which
disappear
into
the
brain
where
is
enabled
to
perceive
them
as
idea
and
so
with
every
other
organ
or
sense
if
the
connection
between
and
the
brain
be
broken
intelligence
will
not
be
manifested
unless
has
by
training
found
out
how
to
project
the
astral
body
from
the
physical
and
thereby
keep
up
communication
with
fellowmen
that
the
organs
and
senses
do
not
cognize
objects
hypnotism
mesmerism
and
spiritualism
have
now
proved
for
as
we
see
in
mesmeric
and
hypnotic
experiments
the
object
seen
or
felt
and
from
which
all
the
effects
of
solid
objects
may
be
sensed
is
often
only
an
idea
existing
in
the
operator
s
brain
in
the
same
way
using
the
astral
body
has
only
to
impress
an
idea
upon
the
other
person
to
make
the
latter
see
the
idea
and
translate
it
into
a
visible
body
from
which
the
usual
effects
of
density
and
weight
seem
to
follow
and
in
hypnotism
there
are
many
experiments
all
of
which
go
to
show
that
so
called
matter
is
not
solid
or
dense
that
sight
does
not
always
depend
on
the
eye
and
rays
of
light
proceeding
from
an
object
that
the
intangible
for
one
normal
brain
and
organs
may
be
perfectly
tangible
for
another
and
that
physical
effects
in
the
body
may
be
produced
from
an
idea
solely
the
experiments
of
producing
a
blister
by
a
simple
piece
of
paper
or
preventing
a
real
blistering
plaster
from
making
a
blister
by
force
of
the
idea
conveyed
to
a
subject
either
that
there
was
to
be
or
not
to
be
a
blister
conclusively
prove
the
power
of
effecting
an
impulse
on
matter
by
the
use
of
that
which
is
called
but
all
these
phenomena
are
the
exhibition
of
the
powers
of
lower
acting
in
the
astral
body
and
the
fourth
using
the
physical
body
as
the
field
for
the
exhibition
of
the
forces
it
is
this
lower
which
retains
all
the
impressions
of
a
and
sometimes
strangely
exhibits
them
in
trances
or
dreams
delirium
induced
states
here
and
there
in
normal
conditions
and
very
often
at
the
time
of
physical
death
but
it
is
so
occupied
with
the
brain
with
memory
and
with
sensation
that
it
usually
presents
but
few
recollections
out
of
the
mass
of
events
that
years
have
brought
before
it
it
interferes
with
the
action
of
higher
because
just
at
the
present
point
of
evolution
desire
and
all
corresponding
powers
faculties
and
senses
are
the
most
highly
developed
thus
obscuring
as
it
were
the
white
light
of
the
spiritual
side
of
it
is
tinted
by
each
object
presented
to
it
whether
it
be
a
or
a
material
one
that
is
to
say
lower
operating
through
the
brain
is
at
once
altered
into
the
shape
and
other
characteristics
of
any
object
mental
or
otherwise
this
causes
it
to
have
four
peculiarities
to
naturally
fly
off
from
any
point
object
or
subject
to
fly
to
some
pleasant
idea
to
fly
to
an
unpleasant
idea
to
remain
passive
and
considering
naught
the
first
is
due
to
memory
and
the
natural
motion
of
the
second
and
third
are
due
to
memory
alone
the
fourth
signifies
sleep
when
not
abnormal
and
when
abnormal
is
going
toward
insanity
these
mental
characteristics
all
belonging
to
lower
are
those
which
the
higher
aided
by
and
has
to
fight
and
conquer
higher
if
able
to
act
becomes
what
we
sometimes
call
genius
if
completely
master
then
one
may
become
a
god
but
memory
continually
presents
pictures
to
lower
and
the
result
is
that
the
higher
is
obscured
sometimes
however
along
the
pathway
of
life
we
do
see
here
and
there
men
who
are
geniuses
or
great
seers
and
prophets
in
these
the
higher
powers
of
are
active
and
the
person
illuminated
such
were
the
great
sages
of
the
past
men
like
buddha
jesus
confucius
zoroaster
and
others
poets
too
such
as
tennyson
longfellow
and
others
are
men
in
whom
higher
now
and
then
sheds
a
bright
ray
on
the
man
below
to
be
soon
obscured
however
by
the
effect
of
dogmatic
religious
education
which
has
given
memory
certain
pictures
that
always
prevent
from
gaining
full
activity
in
this
higher
trinity
we
have
the
god
above
each
one
this
is
and
may
be
called
the
higher
self
next
is
the
spiritual
part
of
the
soul
called
when
thoroughly
united
with
this
may
be
called
the
divine
ego
the
inner
ego
who
reïncarnates
taking
on
body
after
body
storing
up
the
impressions
of
life
after
life
gaining
experience
and
adding
it
to
the
divine
ego
suffering
and
enjoying
through
an
immense
period
of
years
is
the
fifth
united
to
this
is
the
permanent
individuality
which
gives
to
every
man
the
feeling
of
being
himself
and
not
some
other
that
which
through
all
the
changes
of
the
days
and
nights
from
youth
to
the
end
of
life
makes
us
feel
one
identity
through
all
the
period
it
bridges
the
gap
made
by
sleep
in
like
manner
it
bridges
the
gap
made
by
the
sleep
of
death
it
is
this
and
not
our
brain
that
lifts
us
above
the
animal
the
depth
and
variety
of
the
brain
convolutions
in
man
are
caused
by
the
presence
of
and
are
not
the
cause
of
mind
and
when
we
either
wholly
or
now
and
then
become
consciously
united
with
the
spiritual
soul
we
behold
god
as
it
were
this
is
what
the
ancients
all
desired
to
see
but
what
the
moderns
do
not
believe
in
the
latter
preferring
rather
to
throw
away
their
own
right
to
be
great
in
nature
and
to
worship
an
imaginary
god
made
up
solely
of
their
own
fancies
and
not
very
different
from
weak
human
nature
this
permanent
individuality
in
the
present
race
has
therefore
been
through
every
sort
of
experience
for
theosophy
insists
on
its
permanence
and
in
the
necessity
for
its
continuing
to
take
part
in
evolution
it
has
a
duty
to
perform
consisting
in
raising
up
to
a
higher
state
all
the
matter
concerned
in
the
chain
of
globes
to
which
the
earth
belongs
we
have
all
lived
and
taken
part
in
civilization
after
civilization
race
after
race
on
earth
and
will
so
continue
throughout
all
the
rounds
and
races
until
the
seventh
is
complete
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
matter
of
this
globe
and
that
connected
with
it
has
also
been
through
every
kind
of
form
with
possibly
some
exceptions
in
very
low
planes
of
mineral
formation
but
in
general
all
the
matter
visible
or
held
in
space
still
unprecipitated
has
been
moulded
at
one
time
or
another
into
forms
of
all
varieties
many
of
these
being
such
as
we
now
have
no
idea
of
the
processes
of
evolution
therefore
in
some
departments
now
go
forward
with
greater
rapidity
than
in
former
ages
because
both
and
matter
have
acquired
facility
of
action
especially
is
this
so
in
regard
to
man
who
is
the
farthest
ahead
of
all
things
or
beings
in
this
evolution
he
is
now
incarnated
and
projected
into
life
more
quickly
than
in
earlier
periods
when
it
consumed
many
years
to
obtain
a
coat
of
skin
this
coming
into
life
over
and
over
again
can
not
be
avoided
by
the
ordinary
man
because
lower
is
still
bound
by
desire
which
is
the
preponderating
principle
at
the
present
period
being
so
influenced
by
desire
is
continually
deluded
while
in
the
body
and
being
thus
deluded
is
unable
to
prevent
the
action
upon
it
of
the
forces
set
up
in
the
life
time
these
forces
are
generated
by
that
is
by
the
thinking
of
the
life
time
each
thought
makes
a
physical
as
well
as
mental
link
with
the
desire
in
which
it
is
rooted
all
life
is
filled
with
such
thoughts
and
when
the
period
of
rest
after
death
is
ended
is
bound
by
innumerable
electrical
magnetic
threads
to
earth
by
reason
of
the
thoughts
of
the
last
life
and
therefore
by
desire
for
it
was
desire
that
caused
so
many
thoughts
and
ignorance
of
the
true
nature
of
things
an
understanding
of
this
doctrine
of
man
being
really
a
thinker
and
made
of
thought
will
make
clear
all
the
rest
in
relation
to
incarnation
and
reïncarnation
the
body
of
the
inner
man
is
made
of
thought
and
this
being
so
it
must
follow
that
if
the
thoughts
have
more
affinity
for
than
for
life
elsewhere
a
return
to
life
here
is
inevitable
at
the
present
day
is
not
fully
active
in
the
race
as
desire
still
is
uppermost
in
the
next
cycle
of
the
human
period
will
be
fully
active
and
developed
in
the
entire
race
hence
the
people
of
the
earth
have
not
yet
come
to
the
point
of
making
a
conscious
choice
as
to
the
path
they
will
take
but
when
in
the
cycle
referred
to
is
active
all
will
then
be
compelled
to
consciously
make
the
choice
to
right
or
left
the
one
leading
to
complete
and
conscious
union
with
the
other
to
the
annihilation
of
those
beings
who
prefer
that
path
chapter

how
man
has
come
to
be
the
complex
being
that
he
is
and
why
are
questions
that
neither
science
nor
religion
makes
conclusive
answer
to
this
immortal
thinker
having
such
vast
powers
and
possibilities
all
his
because
of
his
intimate
connection
with
every
secret
part
of
nature
from
which
he
has
been
built
up
stands
at
the
top
of
an
immense
and
silent
evolution
he
asks
why
nature
exists
what
the
drama
of
life
has
for
its
aim
how
that
aim
may
be
attained
but
science
and
religion
both
fail
to
give
a
reasonable
reply
science
does
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
give
the
solution
saying
that
the
examination
of
things
as
they
are
is
enough
of
a
task
religion
offers
an
explanation
both
illogical
and
unmeaning
and
acceptable
but
to
the
bigot
as
it
requires
us
to
consider
the
whole
of
nature
as
a
mystery
and
to
seek
for
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
life
with
all
its
sorrow
in
the
pleasure
of
a
god
who
can
not
be
found
out
the
educated
and
enquiring
mind
knows
that
dogmatic
religion
can
only
give
an
answer
invented
by
man
while
it
pretends
to
be
from
god
what
then
is
the
universe
for
and
for
what
final
purpose
is
man
the
immortal
thinker
here
in
evolution
it
is
all
for
the
experience
and
emancipation
of
the
soul
for
the
purpose
of
raising
the
entire
mass
of
manifested
matter
up
to
the
stature
nature
and
dignity
of
conscious
the
great
aim
is
to
reach
not
through
a
race
or
a
tribe
or
some
favored
nation
but
by
and
through
the
perfecting
after
transformation
of
the
whole
mass
of
matter
as
well
as
what
we
now
call
soul
nothing
is
or
is
to
be
left
out
the
aim
for
present
man
is
his
initiation
into
complete
knowledge
and
for
the
other
kingdoms
below
him
that
they
may
be
raised
up
gradually
from
stage
to
stage
to
be
in
time
initiated
also
this
is
evolution
carried
to
its
highest
power
it
is
a
magnificent
prospect
it
makes
of
man
a
god
and
gives
to
every
part
of
nature
the
possibility
of
being
one
day
the
same
there
is
strength
and
nobility
in
it
for
by
this
no
man
is
dwarfed
and
belittled
for
no
one
is
so
originally
sinful
that
he
can
not
rise
above
all
sin
treated
from
the
materialistic
position
of
science
evolution
takes
in
but
half
of
life
while
the
religious
conception
of
it
is
a
mixture
of
nonsense
and
fear
present
religions
keep
the
element
of
fear
and
at
the
same
time
imagine
that
an
almighty
being
can
think
of
no
other
earth
but
this
and
has
to
govern
this
one
very
imperfectly
but
the
old
theosophical
view
makes
the
universe
a
vast
complete
and
perfect
whole
now
the
moment
we
postulate
a
double
evolution
physical
and
spiritual
we
have
at
the
same
time
to
admit
that
it
can
only
be
carried
on
by
reïncarnation
this
is
in
fact
demonstrated
by
science
it
is
shown
that
the
matter
of
the
earth
and
of
all
things
physical
upon
it
was
at
one
time
either
gaseous
or
molten
that
it
cooled
that
it
altered
that
from
its
alterations
and
evolutions
at
last
were
produced
all
the
great
variety
of
things
and
beings
this
on
the
physical
plane
is
transformation
or
change
from
one
form
to
another
the
total
mass
of
matter
is
about
the
same
as
in
the
beginning
of
this
globe
with
a
very
minute
allowance
for
some
star
dust
hence
it
must
have
been
changed
over
and
over
again
and
thus
been
physically
reformed
and
reëmbodied
of
course
to
be
strictly
accurate
we
can
not
use
the
word
reïncarnation
because
incarnate
refers
to
flesh
let
us
say
reëmbodied
and
then
we
see
that
both
for
matter
and
for
man
there
has
been
a
constant
change
of
form
and
this
is
broadly
speaking
reïncarnation
as
to
the
whole
mass
of
matter
the
doctrine
is
that
it
will
all
be
raised
to
man
s
estate
when
man
has
gone
further
on
himself
there
is
no
residuum
left
after
man
s
final
salvation
which
in
a
mysterious
way
is
to
be
disposed
of
or
done
away
with
in
some
remote
dustheap
of
nature
the
true
doctrine
allows
for
nothing
like
that
and
at
the
same
time
is
not
afraid
to
give
the
true
disposition
of
what
would
seem
to
be
a
residuum
it
is
all
worked
up
into
other
states
for
as
the
philosophy
declares
there
is
no
inorganic
matter
whatever
but
that
every
atom
is
alive
and
has
the
germ
of
it
must
follow
that
one
day
it
will
all
have
been
changed
thus
what
is
now
called
human
flesh
is
so
much
matter
that
one
day
was
wholly
mineral
later
on
vegetable
and
now
refined
into
human
atoms
at
a
point
of
time
very
far
from
now
the
present
vegetable
matter
will
have
been
raised
to
the
animal
stage
and
what
we
now
use
as
our
organic
or
fleshy
matter
will
have
changed
by
transformation
through
evolution
into
thinkers
and
so
on
up
the
whole
scale
until
the
time
shall
come
when
what
is
now
known
as
mineral
matter
will
have
passed
on
to
the
human
stage
and
out
into
that
of
thinker
then
at
the
coming
on
of
another
great
period
of
evolution
the
mineral
matter
of
that
time
will
be
some
which
is
now
passing
through
its
lower
transformations
on
other
planets
and
in
other
systems
of
worlds
this
is
perhaps
a
fanciful
scheme
for
the
men
of
the
present
day
who
are
so
accustomed
to
being
called
bad
sinful
weak
and
utterly
foolish
from
their
birth
that
they
fear
to
believe
the
truth
about
themselves
but
for
the
disciples
of
the
ancient
theosophists
it
is
not
impossible
or
fanciful
but
is
logical
and
vast
and
no
doubt
it
will
one
day
be
admitted
by
everyone
when
the
mind
of
the
western
race
has
broken
away
from
mosaic
chronology
and
mosaic
ideas
of
men
and
nature
therefore
as
to
reïncarnation
and
metempsychosis
we
say
that
they
are
first
to
be
applied
to
the
whole
cosmos
and
not
alone
to
man
but
as
man
is
the
most
interesting
object
to
himself
we
will
consider
in
detail
its
application
to
him
this
is
the
most
ancient
of
doctrines
and
is
believed
in
now
by
more
human
minds
than
the
number
of
those
who
do
not
hold
it
the
millions
in
the
east
almost
all
accept
it
it
was
taught
by
the
greeks
a
large
number
of
the
chinese
now
believe
it
as
their
forefathers
did
before
them
the
jews
thought
it
was
true
and
it
has
not
disappeared
from
their
religion
and
jesus
who
is
called
the
founder
of
christianity
also
believed
and
taught
it
in
the
early
christian
church
it
was
known
and
taught
and
the
very
best
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
believed
and
promulgated
it
christians
should
remember
that
jesus
was
a
jew
who
thought
his
mission
was
to
jews
for
he
says
in
matthew
i
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
he
must
have
well
known
the
doctrines
held
by
them
they
all
believed
in
reïncarnation
for
them
moses
adam
noah
seth
and
others
had
returned
to
earth
and
at
the
time
of
jesus
it
was
currently
believed
that
the
old
prophet
elias
was
yet
to
return
so
we
find
first
that
jesus
never
denied
the
doctrine
and
on
various
occasions
assented
to
it
as
when
he
said
that
john
the
baptist
was
actually
the
elias
of
old
whom
the
people
were
expecting
all
this
can
be
seen
by
consulting
matthew
in
chapters
xvii
xi
and
others
in
these
it
is
very
clear
that
jesus
is
shown
as
approving
the
doctrine
of
reïncarnation
and
following
jesus
we
find
paul
in
romans
ix
speaking
of
esau
and
jacob
being
actually
in
existence
before
they
were
born
and
later
such
great
christian
fathers
as
origen
synesius
and
others
believing
and
teaching
the
theory
in
proverbs
viii
we
have
solomon
saying
that
when
the
earth
was
made
he
was
present
and
that
long
before
he
could
have
been
born
as
solomon
his
delights
were
in
the
habitable
parts
of
the
earth
with
the
sons
of
men
john
the
revelator
says
in
revs
iii
he
was
told
in
a
vision
which
refers
to
the
voice
of
god
or
the
voice
of
one
speaking
for
god
that
whosoever
should
overcome
would
not
be
under
the
necessity
of
going
out
any
more
that
is
would
not
need
to
be
reïncarnated
for
five
hundred
years
after
jesus
the
doctrine
was
taught
in
the
church
until
the
council
of
constantinople
then
a
condemnation
was
passed
upon
a
phase
of
the
question
which
has
been
regarded
by
many
as
against
reïncarnation
but
if
that
condemnation
goes
against
the
words
of
jesus
it
is
of
no
effect
it
does
go
against
him
and
thus
the
church
is
in
the
position
of
saying
in
effect
that
jesus
did
not
know
enough
to
curse
as
it
did
a
doctrine
known
and
taught
in
his
day
and
which
was
brought
to
his
notice
prominently
and
never
condemned
but
in
fact
approved
by
him
christianity
is
a
jewish
religion
and
this
doctrine
of
reïncarnation
belongs
to
it
historically
by
succession
from
the
jews
and
also
by
reason
of
its
having
been
taught
by
jesus
and
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
if
there
be
any
truthful
or
logical
way
for
the
christian
church
to
get
out
of
this
of
course
dogmas
of
the
theosophist
would
like
to
be
shown
it
indeed
the
theosophist
holds
that
whenever
a
professed
christian
denies
the
theory
he
thereby
sets
up
his
judgment
against
that
of
jesus
who
must
have
known
more
about
the
matter
than
those
who
follow
him
it
is
the
anathema
hurled
by
the
church
council
and
the
absence
of
the
doctrine
from
the
teaching
now
that
have
damaged
christianity
and
made
of
all
the
christian
nations
people
who
pretend
to
be
followers
of
jesus
and
the
law
of
love
but
who
really
as
nations
are
followers
of
the
mosaic
law
of
retaliation
for
alone
in
reïncarnation
is
the
answer
to
all
the
problems
of
life
and
in
it
and
karma
is
the
force
that
will
make
men
pursue
in
fact
the
ethics
they
have
in
theory
it
is
the
aim
of
the
old
philosophy
to
restore
this
doctrine
to
whatsoever
religion
has
lost
it
and
hence
we
call
it
the
lost
chord
of
but
who
or
what
is
it
that
reïncarnates
it
is
not
the
body
for
that
dies
and
disintegrates
and
but
few
of
us
would
like
to
be
chained
forever
to
such
bodies
as
we
now
have
admitted
to
be
infected
with
disease
except
in
the
case
of
the
savage
it
is
not
the
astral
body
for
as
shown
that
also
has
its
term
and
must
go
to
pieces
after
the
physical
has
gone
nor
is
it
the
passions
and
desires
they
to
be
sure
have
a
very
long
term
because
they
have
the
power
to
reproduce
themselves
in
each
life
so
long
as
we
do
not
eradicate
them
and
reïncarnation
provides
for
that
since
we
are
given
by
it
many
opportunities
of
slowly
one
by
one
killing
off
the
desires
and
passions
which
mar
the
heavenly
picture
of
the
spiritual
man
it
has
been
shown
how
the
passional
part
of
us
coalesces
with
the
astral
after
death
and
makes
a
seeming
being
that
has
a
short
life
to
live
while
it
is
disintegrating
when
the
separation
is
complete
between
the
body
that
has
died
the
astral
body
and
the
passions
and
having
begun
to
busy
itself
with
other
higher
triad
and
who
are
the
real
man
immediately
go
into
another
state
and
when
that
state
which
is
called
or
heaven
is
over
they
are
attracted
back
to
earth
for
reïncarnation
they
are
the
immortal
part
of
us
they
in
fact
and
no
other
are
we
this
should
be
firmly
grasped
by
the
mind
for
upon
its
clear
understanding
depends
the
comprehension
of
the
entire
doctrine
what
stands
in
the
way
of
the
modern
western
man
s
seeing
this
clearly
is
the
long
training
we
have
all
had
in
materialistic
science
and
materializing
religion
both
of
which
have
made
the
mere
physical
body
too
prominent
the
one
has
taught
of
matter
alone
and
the
other
has
preached
the
resurrection
of
the
body
a
doctrine
against
common
sense
fact
logic
and
testimony
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
theory
of
the
bodily
resurrection
has
arisen
from
the
corruption
of
the
older
and
true
teaching
resurrection
is
founded
on
what
job
says
about
seeing
his
redeemer
in
his
flesh
and
on
paul
s
remark
that
the
body
was
raised
incorruptible
but
job
was
an
egyptian
who
spoke
of
seeing
his
teacher
or
initiator
who
was
the
redeemer
and
jesus
and
paul
referred
to
the
spiritual
body
only
although
reïncarnation
is
the
law
of
nature
the
complete
trinity
of
does
not
yet
fully
incarnate
in
this
race
they
use
and
occupy
the
body
by
means
of
the
entrance
of
the
lowest
of
the
three
and
the
other
two
shine
upon
it
from
above
constituting
the
god
in
heaven
this
was
symbolized
in
the
old
jewish
teaching
about
the
heavenly
man
who
stands
with
his
head
in
heaven
and
his
feet
in
hell
that
is
the
head
and
are
yet
in
heaven
and
the
feet
walk
in
hell
which
is
the
body
and
physical
life
for
that
reason
man
is
not
yet
fully
conscious
and
reïncarnations
are
needed
to
at
last
complete
the
incarnation
of
the
whole
trinity
in
the
body
when
that
has
been
accomplished
the
race
will
have
become
as
gods
and
the
godlike
trinity
being
in
full
possession
the
entire
mass
of
matter
will
be
perfected
and
raised
up
for
the
next
step
this
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
made
flesh
it
was
so
grand
a
thing
in
the
case
of
any
single
person
such
as
jesus
or
buddha
as
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
divine
incarnation
and
out
of
this
too
comes
the
idea
of
the
crucifixion
for
is
thus
crucified
for
the
purpose
of
raising
up
the
thief
to
paradise
it
is
because
the
trinity
is
not
yet
incarnate
in
the
race
that
life
has
so
many
mysteries
some
of
which
are
showing
themselves
from
day
to
day
in
all
the
various
experiments
made
on
and
in
man
the
physician
knows
not
what
life
is
nor
why
the
body
moves
as
it
does
because
the
spiritual
portion
is
yet
enshrouded
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
the
scientist
is
wandering
in
the
dark
confounded
and
confused
by
all
that
hypnotism
and
other
strange
things
bring
before
him
because
the
conscious
man
is
out
of
sight
on
the
very
top
of
the
divine
mountain
thus
compelling
the
learned
to
speak
of
the
subconscious
mind
the
latent
personality
and
the
like
and
the
priest
can
give
us
no
light
at
all
because
he
denies
man
s
nature
reduces
all
to
the
level
of
original
sin
and
puts
upon
our
conception
of
god
the
black
mark
of
inability
to
control
or
manage
the
creation
without
invention
of
expedients
to
cure
supposed
errors
but
this
old
truth
solves
the
riddle
and
paints
god
and
nature
in
harmonious
colors
reïncarnation
does
not
mean
that
we
go
into
animal
forms
after
death
as
is
believed
by
some
eastern
peoples
once
a
man
always
a
man
is
the
saying
in
the
great
lodge
but
it
would
not
be
too
much
punishment
for
some
men
were
it
possible
to
condemn
them
to
rebirth
in
brute
bodies
however
nature
does
not
go
by
sentiment
but
by
law
and
we
not
being
able
to
see
all
can
not
say
that
the
brutal
man
is
brute
all
through
his
nature
and
evolution
having
brought
the
thinker
and
immortal
person
on
to
this
plane
can
not
send
him
back
to
the
brute
which
has
not
by
looking
into
two
explanations
for
the
literal
acceptation
by
some
people
in
the
east
of
those
laws
of
manu
which
seem
to
teach
the
transmigrating
into
brutes
insects
and
so
on
we
can
see
how
the
true
student
of
this
doctrine
will
not
fall
into
the
same
error
the
first
is
that
the
various
verses
and
books
teaching
such
transmigration
have
to
do
with
the
actual
method
of
reïncarnation
that
is
with
the
explanation
of
the
actual
physical
processes
which
have
to
be
undergone
by
the
ego
in
passing
from
the
unembodied
to
the
embodied
state
and
also
with
the
roads
ways
or
means
of
descent
from
the
invisible
to
the
visible
plane
this
has
not
yet
been
plainly
explained
in
theosophical
books
because
on
the
one
hand
it
is
a
delicate
matter
and
on
the
other
the
details
would
not
as
yet
be
received
even
by
theosophists
with
credence
although
one
day
they
will
be
and
as
these
details
are
not
of
the
greatest
importance
they
are
not
now
expounded
but
as
we
know
that
no
human
body
is
formed
without
the
union
of
the
sexes
and
that
the
germs
for
such
production
are
locked
up
in
the
sexes
and
must
come
from
food
which
is
taken
into
the
body
it
is
obvious
that
foods
have
something
to
do
with
the
reïncarnating
of
the
ego
now
if
the
road
to
reïncarnation
leads
through
certain
food
and
none
other
it
may
be
possible
that
if
the
ego
gets
entangled
in
food
which
will
not
lead
to
the
germ
of
physical
reproduction
a
punishment
is
indicated
where
manu
says
that
such
and
such
practices
will
lead
to
transmigration
which
is
then
a
hindrance
i
throw
this
out
so
far
for
the
benefit
of
certain
theosophists
who
read
these
and
whose
own
theories
on
this
subject
are
now
rather
vague
and
in
some
instances
based
on
quite
other
hypotheses
the
second
explanation
is
that
inasmuch
as
nature
intends
us
to
use
the
matter
which
comes
into
our
body
and
astral
body
for
the
purpose
among
others
of
benefiting
the
matter
by
the
impress
it
gets
from
association
with
the
human
ego
if
we
use
it
so
as
to
give
it
only
a
brutal
impression
it
must
fly
back
to
the
animal
kingdom
to
be
absorbed
there
instead
of
being
refined
and
kept
on
the
human
plane
and
as
all
the
matter
which
the
human
ego
gathered
to
it
retains
the
stamp
or
photographic
impression
of
the
human
being
the
matter
transmigrates
to
the
lower
level
when
given
an
animal
impress
by
the
ego
this
actual
fact
in
the
great
chemical
laboratory
of
nature
could
easily
be
misconstrued
by
the
ignorant
but
the
students
know
that
once
the
thinker
has
arrived
on
the
scene
he
does
not
return
to
baser
forms
first
because
he
does
not
wish
to
and
second
because
he
can
not
for
just
as
the
blood
in
the
body
is
prevented
by
valves
from
rushing
back
and
engorging
the
heart
so
in
this
greater
system
of
universal
circulation
the
door
is
shut
behind
the
thinker
and
prevents
his
retrocession
reïncarnation
as
a
doctrine
applying
to
the
real
man
does
not
teach
transmigration
into
kingdoms
of
nature
below
the
human
chapter
ix
in
the
west
where
the
object
of
life
is
commercial
financial
social
or
scientific
success
that
is
personal
profit
aggrandizement
and
power
the
real
life
of
man
receives
but
little
attention
and
we
unlike
the
orientals
give
scant
prominence
to
the
doctrine
of
preëxistence
and
reïncarnation
that
the
church
denies
it
is
enough
for
many
with
whom
no
argument
is
of
any
use
relying
on
the
church
they
do
not
wish
to
disturb
the
serenity
of
their
faith
in
dogmas
that
may
be
illogical
and
as
they
have
been
taught
that
the
church
can
bind
them
in
hell
a
blind
fear
of
the
anathema
hurled
at
reïncarnation
in
the
constantinople
council
about
would
alone
debar
them
from
accepting
the
accursed
theory
and
the
church
in
arguing
on
the
doctrine
urges
the
objection
that
if
men
are
convinced
that
they
will
live
many
lives
the
temptation
to
accept
the
present
and
do
evil
without
check
will
be
too
strong
absurd
as
this
seems
it
is
put
forward
by
learned
jesuits
who
say
men
will
rather
have
the
present
chance
than
wait
for
others
if
there
were
no
retribution
at
all
this
would
be
a
good
objection
but
as
nature
has
also
a
nemesis
for
every
evil
doer
and
as
each
under
the
law
of
is
that
of
cause
and
effect
and
perfect
receive
the
exact
consequences
himself
in
every
life
for
what
good
or
bad
deeds
and
thoughts
he
did
and
had
in
other
lives
the
basis
for
moral
conduct
is
secure
it
is
safe
under
this
system
since
no
man
can
by
any
possibility
or
favor
or
edict
or
belief
escape
the
consequences
and
each
one
who
grasps
this
doctrine
will
be
moved
by
conscience
and
the
whole
power
of
nature
to
do
well
in
order
that
he
may
receive
good
and
become
happy
it
is
maintained
that
the
idea
of
rebirth
is
uncongenial
and
unpleasant
because
on
the
one
hand
it
is
cold
allowing
no
sentiment
to
interfere
prohibiting
us
from
renouncing
at
will
a
life
which
we
have
found
to
be
sorrowful
and
on
the
other
that
there
appears
to
be
no
chance
under
it
for
us
to
see
our
loved
ones
who
have
passed
away
before
us
but
whether
we
like
it
or
not
nature
s
laws
go
forward
unerringly
and
sentiment
or
feeling
can
in
no
way
avert
the
consequence
that
must
follow
a
cause
if
we
eat
bad
food
bad
results
must
come
the
glutton
would
have
nature
permit
him
to
gorge
himself
without
the
indigestion
which
will
come
but
nature
s
laws
are
not
to
be
thus
put
aside
now
the
objection
to
reïncarnation
that
we
will
not
see
our
loved
ones
in
heaven
as
promised
in
dogmatic
religion
presupposes
a
complete
stoppage
of
the
evolution
and
development
of
those
who
leave
earth
before
ourselves
and
also
assumes
that
recognition
is
dependent
on
physical
appearance
but
as
we
progress
in
this
life
so
also
must
we
progress
upon
leaving
it
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
compel
the
others
to
await
our
arrival
in
order
that
we
may
recognize
them
and
if
one
reflects
on
the
natural
consequences
of
arising
to
heaven
where
all
trammels
are
cast
off
it
must
be
apparent
that
those
who
have
been
there
say
twenty
of
mortal
years
before
us
must
in
the
nature
of
things
mental
and
spiritual
have
made
a
progress
equal
to
many
hundreds
of
years
here
under
varied
and
very
favorable
circumstances
how
then
could
we
arriving
later
and
still
imperfect
be
able
to
recognize
those
who
had
been
perfecting
themselves
in
heaven
with
such
advantages
and
as
we
know
that
the
body
is
left
behind
to
disintegrate
so
it
is
evident
recognition
can
not
depend
in
the
spiritual
and
mental
life
on
physical
appearance
for
not
only
is
this
thus
plain
but
since
we
are
aware
that
an
unhandsome
or
deformed
body
often
enshrines
a
glorious
mind
and
pure
soul
and
that
a
beautifully
formed
as
in
the
case
of
the
hide
an
incarnate
devil
in
character
the
physical
form
gives
no
guarantee
of
recognition
in
that
world
where
the
body
is
absent
and
the
mother
who
has
lost
a
child
who
had
grown
to
maturity
must
know
that
she
loved
the
child
when
a
baby
as
much
as
afterwards
when
the
great
alteration
to
later
life
had
completely
swept
away
the
form
and
features
of
early
youth
the
theosophists
see
that
this
objection
can
have
no
existence
in
the
face
of
the
eternal
and
pure
life
of
the
soul
and
theosophy
also
teaches
that
those
who
are
like
unto
each
other
and
love
each
other
will
be
reïncarnated
together
whenever
the
conditions
permit
whenever
one
of
us
has
gone
farther
on
the
road
to
perfection
he
will
always
be
moved
to
help
and
comfort
those
who
belong
to
the
same
family
but
when
one
has
become
gross
and
selfish
and
wicked
no
one
would
want
his
companionship
in
any
life
recognition
depends
on
the
inner
sight
and
not
on
outward
appearance
hence
there
is
no
force
in
this
objection
and
the
other
phase
of
it
relating
to
loss
of
parent
child
or
relative
is
based
on
the
erroneous
notion
that
as
the
parents
give
the
child
its
body
so
also
is
given
its
soul
but
soul
is
immortal
and
parentless
hence
this
objection
is
without
a
root
some
urge
that
heredity
invalidates
reïncarnation
we
urge
it
as
proof
heredity
in
giving
us
a
body
in
any
family
provides
the
appropriate
environment
for
the
ego
the
ego
only
goes
into
the
family
which
either
completely
answers
to
its
whole
nature
or
which
gives
an
opportunity
for
the
working
out
of
its
evolution
and
which
is
also
connected
with
it
by
reason
of
past
incarnations
or
causes
mutually
set
up
thus
the
evil
child
may
come
to
the
presently
good
family
because
parents
and
child
are
indissolubly
connected
by
past
actions
it
is
a
chance
for
redemption
to
the
child
and
the
occasion
of
punishment
to
the
parents
this
points
to
bodily
heredity
as
a
natural
rule
governing
the
bodies
we
must
inhabit
just
as
the
houses
in
a
city
will
show
the
mind
of
the
builders
and
as
we
as
well
as
our
parents
were
the
makers
and
influencers
of
bodies
took
part
in
and
are
responsible
for
states
of
society
in
which
the
development
of
physical
body
and
brain
was
either
retarded
or
helped
on
debased
or
the
contrary
so
we
are
in
this
life
responsible
for
the
civilization
in
which
we
now
appear
but
when
we
look
at
the
characters
in
human
bodies
great
inherent
differences
are
seen
this
is
due
to
the
soul
inside
who
is
suffering
or
enjoying
in
the
family
nation
and
race
his
own
thoughts
and
acts
which
in
the
past
lives
have
made
it
inevitable
he
should
incarnate
with
heredity
provides
the
tenement
and
also
imposes
those
limitations
of
capacity
of
brain
or
body
which
are
often
a
punishment
and
sometimes
a
help
but
it
does
not
affect
the
real
ego
the
transmission
of
traits
is
a
physical
matter
and
nothing
more
than
the
coming
out
into
a
nation
of
the
consequences
of
the
prior
lives
of
all
egos
who
are
to
be
in
that
race
the
limitations
imposed
on
the
ego
by
any
family
heredity
are
exact
consequences
of
that
ego
s
prior
lives
the
fact
that
such
physical
traits
and
mental
peculiarities
are
transmitted
does
not
confute
reïncarnation
since
we
know
that
the
guiding
mind
and
real
character
of
each
are
not
the
result
of
a
body
and
brain
but
are
peculiar
to
the
ego
in
its
essential
life
transmission
of
trait
and
tendency
by
means
of
parent
and
body
is
exactly
the
mode
selected
by
nature
for
providing
the
incarnating
ego
with
the
proper
tenement
in
which
to
carry
on
its
work
another
mode
would
be
impossible
and
subversive
of
order
again
those
who
dwell
on
the
objection
from
heredity
forget
that
they
are
accentuating
similarities
and
overlooking
divergencies
for
while
investigations
on
the
line
of
heredity
have
recorded
many
transmitted
traits
they
have
not
done
so
in
respect
to
divergencies
from
heredity
vastly
greater
in
number
every
mother
knows
that
the
children
of
a
family
are
as
different
in
character
as
the
fingers
on
one
are
all
from
the
same
parents
but
all
vary
in
character
and
capacity
but
heredity
as
the
great
rule
and
as
a
complete
explanation
is
absolutely
overthrown
by
history
which
shows
no
constant
transmission
of
learning
power
and
capacity
for
instance
in
the
case
of
the
ancient
egyptians
long
gone
and
their
line
of
transmission
shattered
we
have
no
transmission
to
their
descendants
if
physical
heredity
settles
the
question
of
character
how
has
the
great
egyptian
character
been
lost
the
same
question
holds
in
respect
to
other
ancient
and
extinct
nations
and
taking
an
individual
illustration
we
have
the
great
musician
bach
whose
direct
descendants
showed
a
decrease
in
musical
ability
leading
to
its
final
disappearance
from
the
family
stock
but
theosophy
teaches
that
in
both
of
these
in
all
like
real
capacity
and
ability
have
only
disappeared
from
a
family
and
national
body
but
are
retained
in
the
egos
who
once
exhibited
them
being
now
incarnated
in
some
other
nation
and
family
of
the
present
time
suffering
comes
to
nearly
all
men
and
a
great
many
live
lives
of
sorrow
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
so
it
is
objected
that
reïncarnation
is
unjust
because
we
suffer
for
the
wrong
done
by
some
other
person
in
another
life
this
objection
is
based
on
the
false
notion
that
the
person
in
the
other
life
was
some
one
else
but
in
every
life
it
is
the
same
person
when
we
come
again
we
do
not
take
up
the
body
of
some
one
else
nor
another
s
deeds
but
are
like
an
actor
who
plays
many
parts
the
same
actor
inside
though
the
costumes
and
the
lines
recited
differ
in
each
new
play
shakespeare
was
right
in
saying
that
life
is
a
play
for
the
great
life
of
the
soul
is
a
drama
and
each
new
life
and
rebirth
another
act
in
which
we
assume
another
part
and
put
on
a
new
dress
but
all
through
it
we
are
the
person
so
instead
of
its
being
unjust
it
is
perfect
justice
and
in
no
other
manner
could
justice
be
preserved
but
it
is
said
if
we
reïncarnate
how
is
it
that
we
do
not
remember
the
other
life
and
further
as
we
can
not
remember
the
deeds
for
which
we
suffer
is
it
not
unjust
for
that
reason
those
who
ask
this
always
ignore
the
fact
that
they
also
have
enjoyment
and
reward
in
life
and
are
content
to
accept
them
without
question
for
if
it
is
unjust
to
be
punished
for
deeds
we
do
not
remember
then
it
is
also
inequitable
to
be
rewarded
for
other
acts
which
have
been
forgotten
mere
entry
into
life
is
no
fit
foundation
for
any
reward
or
punishment
reward
and
punishment
must
be
the
just
desert
for
prior
conduct
nature
s
law
of
justice
is
not
imperfect
and
it
is
only
the
imperfection
of
human
justice
that
requires
the
offender
to
know
and
remember
in
this
life
a
deed
to
which
a
penalty
is
annexed
in
the
prior
life
the
doer
was
then
quite
aware
of
what
he
did
and
nature
affixes
consequences
to
his
acts
being
thus
just
we
well
know
that
she
will
make
the
effect
follow
the
cause
whatever
we
wish
and
whether
we
remember
or
forget
what
we
did
if
a
baby
is
hurt
in
its
first
years
by
the
nurse
so
as
to
lay
the
ground
for
a
crippling
disease
in
after
life
as
is
often
the
case
the
crippling
disease
will
come
although
the
child
neither
brought
on
the
present
cause
nor
remembered
aught
about
it
but
reïncarnation
with
its
companion
doctrine
of
karma
rightly
understood
shows
how
perfectly
just
the
whole
scheme
of
nature
is
memory
of
a
prior
life
is
not
needed
to
prove
that
we
passed
through
that
existence
nor
is
the
fact
of
not
remembering
a
good
objection
we
forget
the
greater
part
of
the
occurrences
of
the
years
and
days
of
this
life
but
no
one
would
say
for
that
reason
we
did
not
go
through
these
years
they
were
lived
and
we
retain
but
little
of
the
details
in
the
brain
but
the
entire
effect
of
them
on
the
character
is
kept
and
made
a
part
of
ourselves
the
whole
mass
of
detail
of
a
life
is
preserved
in
the
inner
man
to
be
one
day
fully
brought
back
to
the
conscious
memory
in
some
other
life
when
we
are
perfected
and
even
now
imperfect
as
we
are
and
little
as
we
know
the
experiments
in
hypnotism
show
that
all
the
smallest
details
are
registered
in
what
is
for
the
present
known
as
the
subconscious
mind
the
theosophical
doctrine
is
that
not
a
single
one
of
these
happenings
is
forgotten
in
fact
and
at
the
end
of
life
when
the
eyes
are
closed
and
those
about
say
we
are
dead
every
thought
and
circumstance
of
life
flash
vividly
into
and
across
the
mind
many
persons
do
however
remember
that
they
have
lived
before
poets
have
sung
of
this
children
know
it
well
until
the
constant
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
unbelief
drives
the
recollection
from
their
minds
for
the
present
but
all
are
subject
to
the
limitations
imposed
upon
the
ego
by
the
new
brain
in
each
life
this
is
why
we
are
not
able
to
keep
the
pictures
of
the
past
whether
of
this
life
or
the
preceding
ones
the
brain
is
the
instrument
for
the
memory
of
the
soul
and
being
new
in
each
life
with
but
a
certain
capacity
the
ego
is
only
able
to
use
it
for
the
new
life
up
to
its
capacity
that
capacity
will
be
fully
availed
of
or
the
contrary
just
according
to
the
ego
s
own
desire
and
prior
conduct
because
such
past
living
will
have
increased
or
diminished
its
power
to
overcome
the
forces
of
material
existence
by
living
according
to
the
dictates
of
the
soul
the
brain
may
at
last
be
made
porous
to
the
soul
s
recollections
if
the
contrary
sort
of
a
life
is
led
then
more
and
more
will
clouds
obscure
that
reminiscence
but
as
the
brain
had
no
part
in
the
life
last
lived
it
is
in
general
unable
to
remember
and
this
is
a
wise
law
for
we
should
be
very
miserable
if
the
deeds
and
scenes
of
our
former
lives
were
not
hidden
from
our
view
until
by
discipline
we
become
able
to
bear
a
knowledge
of
them
another
objection
brought
up
is
that
under
the
doctrine
of
reïncarnation
it
is
not
possible
to
account
for
the
increase
of
the
world
s
population
this
assumes
that
we
know
surely
that
its
population
has
increased
and
are
keeping
informed
of
its
fluctuations
but
it
is
not
certain
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
have
increased
and
further
vast
numbers
of
people
are
annually
destroyed
of
whom
we
know
nothing
in
china
year
after
year
many
thousands
have
been
carried
off
by
flood
statistics
of
famine
have
not
been
made
we
do
not
know
by
how
many
thousands
the
deaths
in
africa
exceed
the
births
in
any
year
the
objection
is
based
on
imperfect
tables
which
only
have
to
do
with
western
lands
it
also
assumes
that
there
are
fewer
egos
out
of
incarnation
and
waiting
to
come
in
than
the
number
of
those
inhabiting
bodies
and
this
is
incorrect
annie
besant
has
put
this
well
in
her
reïncarnation
by
saying
that
the
inhabited
globe
resembles
a
hall
in
a
town
which
is
filled
from
the
much
greater
population
of
the
town
outside
the
number
in
the
hall
may
vary
but
there
is
a
constant
source
of
supply
from
the
town
it
is
true
that
so
far
as
concerns
this
globe
the
number
of
egos
belonging
to
it
is
definite
but
no
one
knows
what
that
quantity
is
nor
what
is
the
total
capacity
of
the
earth
for
sustaining
them
the
statisticians
of
the
day
are
chiefly
in
the
west
and
their
tables
embrace
but
a
small
section
of
the
history
of
man
they
can
not
say
how
many
persons
were
incarnated
on
the
earth
at
any
prior
date
when
the
globe
was
full
in
all
parts
hence
the
quantity
of
egos
willing
or
waiting
to
be
reborn
is
unknown
to
the
men
of
the
masters
of
theosophical
knowledge
say
that
the
total
number
of
such
egos
is
vast
and
for
that
reason
the
supply
of
those
for
the
occupation
of
bodies
to
be
born
over
and
above
the
number
that
die
is
sufficient
then
too
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
each
ego
for
itself
varies
the
length
of
stay
in
the
states
they
do
not
reïncarnate
at
the
same
interval
but
come
out
of
the
state
after
death
at
different
rates
and
whenever
there
occurs
a
great
number
of
deaths
by
war
pestilence
or
famine
there
is
at
once
a
rush
of
souls
to
incarnation
either
in
the
same
place
or
in
some
other
place
or
race
the
earth
is
so
small
a
globe
in
the
vast
assemblage
of
inhabitable
planets
there
is
a
sufficient
supply
of
egos
for
incarnation
here
but
with
due
respect
to
those
who
put
this
objection
i
do
not
see
that
it
has
the
slightest
force
or
any
relation
to
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
of
reïncarnation
chapter
x
unless
we
deny
the
immortality
of
man
and
the
existence
of
soul
there
are
no
sound
arguments
against
the
doctrine
of
preëxistence
and
save
such
as
rest
on
the
dictum
of
the
church
that
each
soul
is
a
new
creation
this
dictum
can
be
supported
only
by
blind
dogmatism
for
given
a
soul
we
must
sooner
or
later
arrive
at
the
theory
of
because
even
if
each
soul
is
new
on
this
earth
it
must
keep
on
living
somewhere
after
passing
away
and
in
view
of
the
known
order
of
nature
will
have
other
bodies
in
other
planets
or
spheres
theosophy
applies
to
the
same
laws
which
are
seen
everywhere
in
operation
throughout
nature
and
those
are
all
varieties
of
the
great
law
that
effects
follow
causes
and
no
effect
is
without
a
cause
the
soul
s
in
by
the
mass
of
embodiment
here
or
elsewhere
and
to
be
embodied
means
reïncarnation
if
we
come
to
this
earth
for
but
a
few
years
and
then
go
to
some
other
the
soul
must
be
embodied
there
as
well
as
here
and
if
we
have
travelled
from
some
other
world
we
must
have
had
there
too
our
proper
vesture
the
powers
of
mind
and
the
laws
governing
its
motion
its
attachment
and
its
detachment
as
given
in
theosophical
philosophy
show
that
its
reëmbodiment
must
be
here
where
it
moved
and
worked
until
such
time
as
the
mind
is
able
to
overcome
the
forces
which
chain
it
to
this
globe
to
permit
the
involved
entity
to
transfer
itself
to
another
scene
of
action
before
it
had
overcome
all
the
causes
drawing
it
here
and
without
its
having
worked
out
its
responsibilities
to
other
entities
in
the
same
stream
of
evolution
would
be
unjust
and
contrary
to
the
powerful
occult
laws
and
forces
which
continually
operate
upon
it
the
early
christian
fathers
saw
this
and
taught
that
the
soul
had
fallen
into
matter
and
was
obliged
by
the
law
of
its
nature
to
toil
upward
again
to
the
place
from
which
it
came
they
used
an
old
greek
hymn
which
ran
eternal
mind
thy
seedling
spark
through
this
thin
vase
of
clay
athwart
the
waves
of
chaos
dark
emits
a
timorous
ray
this
mind
enfolding
soul
is
sown
incarnate
germ
in
earth
in
pity
blessed
lord
then
own
what
claims
in
thee
its
birth
far
forth
from
thee
thou
central
fire
to
earth
s
sad
bondage
cast
let
not
the
trembling
spark
expire
absorb
thine
own
at
last
each
human
being
has
a
definite
character
different
from
every
other
human
being
and
masses
of
beings
aggregated
into
nations
show
as
wholes
that
the
national
force
and
distinguishing
peculiarities
go
to
make
up
a
definite
and
separate
national
character
these
differences
both
individual
and
national
are
due
to
essential
character
and
not
to
education
even
the
doctrine
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
should
show
this
for
the
fitness
can
not
come
from
nothing
but
must
at
last
show
itself
from
the
coming
to
the
surface
of
the
actual
inner
character
and
as
both
individuals
and
nations
among
those
who
are
ahead
in
the
struggle
with
nature
exhibit
an
immense
force
in
their
character
we
must
find
a
place
and
time
where
the
force
was
evolved
these
theosophy
says
are
this
earth
and
the
whole
period
during
which
the
human
race
has
been
on
the
planet
so
then
while
heredity
has
something
to
do
with
the
difference
in
character
as
to
force
and
morale
swaying
the
soul
and
mind
a
little
and
furnishing
also
the
appropriate
place
for
receiving
reward
and
punishment
it
is
not
the
cause
for
the
essential
nature
shown
by
every
one
but
all
these
differences
such
as
those
shown
by
babes
from
birth
by
adults
as
character
comes
forth
more
and
more
and
by
nations
in
their
history
are
due
to
long
experience
gained
during
many
lives
on
earth
are
the
outcome
of
the
soul
s
own
evolution
a
survey
of
one
short
human
life
gives
no
ground
for
the
production
of
his
inner
nature
it
is
needful
that
each
soul
should
have
all
possible
experience
and
one
life
can
not
give
this
even
under
the
best
conditions
it
would
be
folly
for
the
almighty
to
put
us
here
for
such
a
short
time
only
to
remove
us
just
when
we
had
begun
to
see
the
object
of
life
and
the
possibilities
in
it
the
mere
selfish
desire
of
a
person
to
escape
the
trials
and
discipline
of
life
is
not
enough
to
set
nature
s
laws
aside
so
the
soul
must
be
reborn
until
it
has
ceased
to
set
in
motion
the
cause
of
rebirth
after
having
developed
character
up
to
its
possible
limit
as
indicated
by
all
the
varieties
of
human
nature
when
every
experience
has
been
passed
through
and
not
until
all
of
truth
that
can
be
known
has
been
acquired
the
vast
disparity
among
men
in
respect
to
capacity
compels
us
if
we
wish
to
ascribe
justice
to
nature
or
to
god
to
admit
reïncarnation
and
to
trace
the
origin
of
the
disparity
back
to
the
past
lives
of
the
ego
for
people
are
as
much
hindered
and
handicapped
abused
and
made
the
victims
of
seeming
injustice
because
of
limited
capacity
as
they
are
by
reason
of
circumstances
of
birth
or
education
we
see
the
uneducated
rising
above
circumstances
of
family
and
training
and
often
those
born
in
good
families
have
very
small
capacity
but
the
troubles
of
nations
and
families
arise
from
want
of
capacity
more
than
from
any
other
cause
and
if
we
consider
savage
races
only
there
the
seeming
injustice
is
enormous
for
many
savages
have
good
actual
brain
capacity
but
still
are
savage
this
is
because
the
ego
in
that
body
is
still
savage
and
undeveloped
for
in
contrast
to
the
savage
there
are
many
civilized
men
with
small
actual
brain
force
who
are
not
savage
in
nature
because
the
indwelling
ego
has
had
long
experience
in
civilization
during
other
lives
and
being
a
more
developed
soul
has
power
to
use
the
brain
instrument
to
its
highest
limit
each
man
feels
and
knows
that
he
has
an
individuality
of
his
own
a
personal
identity
which
bridges
over
not
only
the
gaps
made
by
sleep
but
also
those
sometimes
supervening
on
temporary
lesions
in
the
brain
this
identity
never
breaks
from
beginning
to
end
of
life
in
the
normal
person
and
only
the
persistence
and
eternal
character
of
the
soul
will
account
for
it
so
ever
since
we
began
to
remember
we
know
that
our
personal
identity
has
not
failed
us
no
matter
how
bad
may
be
our
memory
this
disposes
of
the
argument
that
identity
depends
on
recollection
for
the
reason
that
if
it
did
depend
alone
on
recollection
we
should
each
day
have
to
begin
over
again
as
we
can
not
remember
the
events
of
the
past
in
detail
and
some
minds
remember
but
little
yet
feel
their
personal
identity
and
as
it
is
often
seen
that
some
who
remember
the
least
insist
as
strongly
as
the
others
on
their
personal
identity
that
persistence
of
feeling
must
come
from
the
old
and
immortal
soul
viewing
life
and
its
probable
object
with
all
the
varied
experience
possible
for
man
one
must
be
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
a
single
life
is
not
enough
for
carrying
out
all
that
is
intended
by
nature
to
say
nothing
of
what
man
himself
desires
to
do
the
scale
of
variety
in
experience
is
enormous
there
is
a
vast
range
of
powers
latent
in
man
which
we
see
may
be
developed
if
opportunity
be
given
knowledge
infinite
in
scope
and
diversity
lies
before
us
and
especially
in
these
days
when
special
investigation
is
the
rule
we
perceive
that
we
have
high
aspirations
with
no
time
to
reach
up
to
their
measure
while
the
great
troop
of
passions
and
desires
selfish
motives
and
ambitions
war
with
us
and
among
themselves
pursuing
us
even
to
the
door
of
death
all
these
have
to
be
tried
conquered
used
subdued
one
life
is
not
enough
for
all
this
to
say
that
we
have
but
one
life
here
with
such
possibilities
put
before
us
and
impossible
of
development
is
to
make
the
universe
and
life
a
huge
and
cruel
joke
perpetrated
by
a
powerful
god
who
is
thus
accused
by
those
who
believe
in
a
special
creation
of
souls
of
triumphing
and
playing
with
puny
man
just
because
that
man
is
small
and
the
creature
of
the
almighty
a
human
life
at
most
is
seventy
years
statistics
reduce
this
to
about
forty
and
out
of
that
little
remainder
a
large
part
is
spent
in
sleep
and
another
part
in
childhood
thus
in
one
life
it
is
perfectly
impossible
to
attain
to
the
merest
fraction
of
what
nature
evidently
has
in
view
we
see
many
truths
vaguely
which
a
life
gives
us
no
time
to
grasp
and
especially
is
this
so
when
men
have
to
make
such
a
struggle
to
live
at
all
our
faculties
are
small
or
dwarfed
or
weak
one
life
gives
no
opportunity
to
alter
this
we
perceive
other
powers
latent
in
us
that
can
not
possibly
be
brought
out
in
such
a
small
space
of
time
and
we
have
much
more
than
a
suspicion
that
the
extent
of
the
field
of
truth
is
vastly
greater
than
the
narrow
circle
we
are
confined
to
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
either
god
or
nature
projects
us
into
a
body
simply
to
fill
us
with
bitterness
because
we
can
have
no
other
opportunity
here
but
rather
we
must
conclude
that
a
series
of
incarnations
has
led
to
the
present
condition
and
that
the
process
of
coming
here
again
and
again
must
go
on
for
the
purpose
of
affording
us
the
opportunity
needed
the
mere
fact
of
dying
is
not
of
itself
enough
to
bring
about
development
of
faculties
or
the
elimination
of
wrong
tendency
and
inclination
if
we
assume
that
upon
entering
heaven
we
at
once
acquire
all
knowledge
and
purity
then
that
state
after
death
is
reduced
to
a
dead
level
and
life
itself
with
all
its
discipline
is
shorn
of
every
meaning
some
of
the
churches
teach
of
a
school
of
discipline
after
death
where
it
is
impudently
stated
that
the
apostles
themselves
well
known
to
be
ignorant
men
are
to
be
the
teachers
this
is
absurd
and
devoid
of
any
basis
or
reason
in
the
natural
order
besides
if
there
is
to
be
such
subsequent
discipline
why
were
we
projected
into
life
at
all
and
why
after
the
suffering
and
the
error
committed
are
we
taken
from
the
place
where
we
did
our
acts
the
only
solution
left
is
in
reïncarnation
we
come
back
to
earth
because
on
it
and
with
the
beings
upon
it
our
deeds
were
performed
because
it
is
the
only
proper
place
where
punishment
and
reward
can
be
justly
meted
out
because
here
is
the
only
natural
spot
in
which
to
continue
the
struggle
toward
perfection
toward
the
development
of
the
faculties
we
have
and
the
destruction
of
the
wickedness
in
us
justice
to
ourselves
and
to
all
other
beings
demands
it
for
we
can
not
live
for
ourselves
and
it
would
be
unjust
to
permit
some
of
us
to
escape
leaving
those
who
were
participants
with
us
to
remain
or
to
be
plunged
into
a
hell
of
eternal
duration
the
persistence
of
savagery
the
rise
and
decay
of
nations
and
civilizations
the
total
extinction
of
nations
all
demand
an
explanation
found
nowhere
but
in
reïncarnation
savagery
remains
because
there
are
still
egos
whose
experience
is
so
limited
that
they
are
still
savage
they
will
come
up
into
higher
races
when
ready
races
die
out
because
the
egos
have
had
enough
of
the
experience
that
sort
of
race
gives
so
we
find
the
red
indian
the
hottentot
the
easter
islanders
and
others
as
examples
of
races
deserted
by
high
egos
and
as
they
are
dying
away
other
souls
who
have
had
no
higher
life
in
the
past
enter
into
the
bodies
of
the
race
to
go
on
using
them
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
such
experience
as
the
race
body
will
give
a
race
could
not
possibly
arise
and
then
suddenly
go
out
we
see
that
such
is
not
the
case
but
science
has
no
explanation
it
simply
says
that
this
is
the
fact
that
nations
decay
but
in
this
explanation
no
account
is
taken
of
the
inner
man
nor
of
the
recondite
subtle
and
occult
laws
that
unite
to
make
a
race
theosophy
shows
that
the
energy
drawn
together
has
to
expend
itself
gradually
and
therefore
the
reproduction
of
bodies
of
the
character
of
that
race
will
go
on
though
the
egos
are
not
compelled
to
inhabit
bodies
of
that
sort
any
longer
than
while
they
are
of
the
same
development
as
the
race
hence
a
time
comes
when
the
whole
mass
of
egos
which
built
up
the
race
leaves
it
for
another
physical
environment
more
like
themselves
the
economy
of
nature
will
not
permit
the
physical
race
to
suddenly
fade
away
and
so
in
the
real
order
of
evolution
other
and
less
progressed
egos
come
in
and
use
the
forms
provided
keeping
up
the
production
of
new
bodies
but
less
and
less
in
number
each
century
these
lower
egos
are
not
able
to
keep
up
to
the
limit
of
the
capacity
of
the
congeries
of
energies
left
by
the
other
egos
and
so
while
the
new
set
gains
as
much
experience
as
is
possible
the
race
in
time
dies
out
after
passing
through
its
decay
this
is
the
explanation
of
what
we
may
call
descending
savagery
and
no
other
theory
will
meet
the
facts
it
has
been
sometimes
thought
by
ethnologists
that
the
more
civilized
races
kill
off
the
others
but
the
fact
is
that
in
consequence
of
the
great
difference
between
the
egos
inhabiting
the
old
race
body
and
the
energy
of
that
body
itself
the
females
begin
to
be
sterile
and
thus
slowly
but
surely
the
number
of
deaths
exceeds
the
births
china
itself
is
in
process
of
decay
she
being
now
in
the
almost
stationary
stage
just
before
the
rush
downward
great
civilizations
like
those
of
egypt
and
babylon
have
gone
because
the
souls
who
made
them
have
long
ago
reïncarnated
in
the
great
conquering
nations
of
europe
and
the
present
american
continents
as
nations
and
races
they
have
been
totally
reïncarnated
and
born
again
for
greater
and
higher
purposes
than
ever
of
all
the
old
races
the
aryan
indian
alone
yet
remains
as
the
preserver
of
the
old
doctrines
it
will
one
day
rise
again
to
its
old
heights
of
glory
the
appearance
of
geniuses
and
great
minds
in
families
destitute
of
these
qualities
as
well
as
the
extinction
from
a
family
of
the
genius
shown
by
some
ancestor
can
only
be
met
by
the
law
of
rebirth
napoleon
the
first
came
in
a
family
wholly
unlike
him
in
power
and
force
nothing
in
his
heredity
will
explain
his
character
he
said
himself
as
told
in
the
memoirs
of
prince
talleyrand
that
he
was
charlemagne
only
by
assuming
for
him
a
long
series
of
lives
giving
the
right
line
of
evolution
or
cause
for
his
mind
and
nature
and
force
to
be
brought
out
can
we
have
the
slightest
idea
why
he
or
any
other
great
genius
appeared
at
all
mozart
when
an
infant
could
compose
orchestral
score
this
was
not
due
to
heredity
for
such
a
score
is
not
natural
but
is
forced
mechanical
and
wholly
conventional
yet
he
understood
it
without
schooling
how
because
he
was
a
musician
reïncarnated
with
a
musical
brain
furnished
by
his
family
and
thus
not
impeded
in
his
endeavors
to
show
forth
his
musical
knowledge
but
stronger
yet
is
the
case
of
blind
tom
a
negro
whose
family
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
a
knowledge
of
the
piano
a
modern
instrument
so
as
to
transmit
that
knowledge
to
the
atoms
of
his
body
yet
he
had
great
musical
power
and
knew
the
present
mechanical
musical
scale
on
the
piano
there
are
hundreds
of
examples
like
these
among
the
many
prodigies
who
have
appeared
to
the
world
s
astonishment
in
india
there
are
many
histories
of
sages
born
with
complete
knowledge
of
philosophy
and
the
like
and
doubtless
in
all
nations
the
same
can
be
met
with
this
bringing
back
of
knowledge
also
explains
instinct
for
that
is
no
more
than
recollection
divisible
into
physical
and
mental
memory
it
is
seen
in
the
child
and
the
animal
and
is
no
more
than
the
result
of
previous
experience
and
whether
we
look
at
the
babe
flinging
out
its
arms
for
or
the
animal
with
very
strong
instinctual
power
or
the
bee
building
a
cell
on
the
rules
of
geometry
it
is
all
the
effect
of
reïncarnation
acting
either
in
the
mind
or
physical
cell
for
under
what
was
first
laid
down
no
atom
is
devoid
of
life
consciousness
and
intelligence
of
its
own
in
the
case
of
the
musician
bach
we
have
proof
that
heredity
counts
for
nothing
if
the
ego
is
not
advanced
for
his
genius
was
not
borne
down
his
family
line
it
gradually
faded
out
finally
leaving
the
family
stream
entirely
so
too
the
coming
of
idiots
or
vicious
children
to
parents
who
are
good
pure
or
highly
intellectual
is
explained
in
the
same
way
they
are
cases
where
heredity
is
set
at
nought
by
a
wholly
bad
or
deficient
ego
and
lastly
the
fact
that
certain
inherent
ideas
are
common
to
the
whole
race
is
explained
by
the
sages
as
due
to
recollection
of
such
ideas
which
were
implanted
in
the
human
mind
at
the
very
beginning
of
its
evolutionary
career
on
this
planet
by
those
brothers
and
sages
who
learned
their
lessons
and
were
perfected
in
former
ages
long
before
the
development
of
this
globe
began
no
explanation
for
inherent
ideas
is
offered
by
science
that
will
do
more
than
say
they
these
were
actually
taught
to
the
mass
of
egos
who
are
engaged
in
this
earth
s
evolution
they
were
imprinted
or
burned
into
their
natures
and
always
recollected
they
follow
the
ego
through
the
long
pilgrimage
it
has
been
often
thought
that
the
opposition
to
reïncarnation
has
been
solely
based
on
prejudice
when
not
due
to
a
dogma
which
can
only
stand
when
the
mind
is
bound
down
and
prevented
from
using
its
own
powers
it
is
a
doctrine
the
most
noble
of
all
and
with
its
companion
one
of
karma
next
to
be
considered
it
alone
gives
the
basis
for
ethics
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
founder
of
christianity
took
it
for
granted
and
that
its
present
absence
from
that
religion
is
the
reason
for
the
contradiction
between
the
professed
ethics
of
christian
nations
and
their
actual
practices
which
are
so
contrary
to
the
morals
given
out
by
jesus
chapter
xi
karma
is
an
unfamiliar
word
for
western
ears
it
is
the
name
adopted
by
theosophists
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
laws
of
nature
ceaseless
in
its
operation
it
bears
alike
upon
planets
systems
of
planets
races
nations
families
and
individuals
it
is
the
twin
doctrine
to
reïncarnation
so
inextricably
interlaced
are
these
two
laws
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
properly
consider
one
apart
from
the
other
no
spot
or
being
in
the
universe
is
exempt
from
the
operation
of
karma
but
all
are
under
its
sway
punished
for
error
by
it
yet
beneficently
led
on
through
discipline
rest
and
reward
to
the
distant
heights
of
perfection
it
is
a
law
so
comprehensive
in
its
sweep
embracing
at
once
our
physical
and
our
moral
being
that
it
is
only
by
paraphrase
and
copious
explanation
one
can
convey
its
meaning
in
english
for
that
reason
the
sanscrit
term
was
adopted
to
designate
it
applied
to
man
s
moral
life
it
is
the
law
of
ethical
causation
justice
reward
and
punishment
the
cause
for
birth
and
rebirth
yet
equally
the
means
for
escape
from
incarnation
viewed
from
another
point
it
is
merely
effect
flowing
from
cause
action
and
reaction
exact
result
for
every
thought
and
act
it
is
act
and
the
result
of
act
for
the
word
s
literal
meaning
is
action
theosophy
views
the
universe
as
an
intelligent
whole
hence
every
motion
in
the
universe
is
an
action
of
that
whole
leading
to
results
which
themselves
become
causes
for
further
results
viewing
it
thus
broadly
the
ancient
hindus
said
that
every
being
up
to
brahma
was
under
the
rule
of
karma
it
is
not
a
being
but
a
law
the
universal
law
of
harmony
which
unerringly
restores
all
disturbance
to
equilibrium
in
this
the
theory
conflicts
with
the
ordinary
conception
about
god
built
up
from
the
jewish
system
which
assumes
that
the
almighty
as
a
thinking
entity
extraneous
to
the
cosmos
builds
up
finds
his
construction
inharmonious
out
of
proportion
errant
and
disturbed
and
then
has
to
pull
down
destroy
or
punish
that
which
he
created
this
has
either
caused
thousands
to
live
in
fear
of
god
in
compliance
with
his
assumed
commands
with
the
selfish
object
of
obtaining
reward
and
securing
escape
from
his
wrath
or
has
plunged
them
into
darkness
which
comes
from
a
denial
of
all
spiritual
life
but
as
there
is
plainly
indeed
painfully
evident
to
every
human
being
a
constant
destruction
going
on
in
and
around
us
a
continual
war
not
only
among
men
but
everywhere
through
the
whole
solar
system
causing
sorrow
in
all
directions
reason
requires
a
solution
of
the
riddle
the
poor
who
see
no
refuge
or
hope
cry
aloud
to
a
god
who
makes
no
reply
and
then
envy
springs
up
in
them
when
they
consider
the
comforts
and
opportunities
of
the
rich
they
see
the
rich
profligates
the
wealthy
fools
enjoying
themselves
unpunished
turning
to
the
teacher
of
religion
they
meet
the
reply
to
their
questioning
of
the
justice
which
will
permit
such
misery
to
those
who
did
nothing
requiring
them
to
be
born
with
no
means
no
opportunities
for
education
no
capacity
to
overcome
social
racial
or
circumstantial
obstacles
it
is
the
will
of
parents
produce
beloved
offspring
who
are
cut
off
by
death
at
an
untimely
hour
just
when
all
promised
well
they
too
have
no
answer
to
the
question
why
am
i
thus
afflicted
but
the
same
unreasonable
reference
to
an
inaccessible
god
whose
arbitrary
will
causes
their
misery
thus
in
every
walk
of
life
loss
injury
persecution
deprivation
of
opportunity
nature
s
own
forces
working
to
destroy
the
happiness
of
man
death
reverses
disappointment
continually
beset
good
and
evil
men
alike
but
nowhere
is
there
any
answer
or
relief
save
in
the
ancient
truths
that
each
man
is
the
maker
and
fashioner
of
his
own
destiny
the
only
one
who
sets
in
motion
the
causes
for
his
own
happiness
and
misery
in
one
life
he
sows
and
in
the
next
he
reaps
thus
on
and
forever
the
law
of
karma
leads
him
karma
is
a
beneficent
law
wholly
merciful
relentlessly
just
for
true
mercy
is
not
favor
but
impartial
justice
my
brothers
each
man
s
life
the
outcome
of
his
former
living
is
the
bygone
wrongs
bring
forth
sorrows
and
woes
the
bygone
right
breeds
bliss
this
is
the
doctrine
of
how
is
the
present
life
affected
by
that
bygone
right
and
wrong
act
and
is
it
always
by
way
of
punishment
is
karma
only
fate
under
another
name
an
already
fixed
and
formulated
destiny
from
which
no
escape
is
possible
and
which
therefore
might
make
us
careless
of
act
or
thought
that
can
not
affect
destiny
it
is
not
fatalism
everything
done
in
a
former
body
has
consequences
which
in
the
new
birth
the
ego
must
enjoy
or
suffer
for
as
paul
said
brethren
be
not
deceived
god
is
not
mocked
for
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
also
for
the
effect
is
in
the
cause
and
karma
produces
the
manifestation
of
it
in
the
body
brain
and
mind
furnished
by
reïncarnation
and
as
a
cause
set
up
by
one
man
has
a
distinct
relation
to
him
as
a
centre
from
which
it
came
so
each
one
experiences
the
results
of
his
own
acts
we
may
sometimes
seem
to
receive
effects
solely
from
the
acts
of
others
but
this
is
the
result
of
our
own
acts
and
thoughts
in
this
or
some
prior
life
we
perform
our
acts
in
company
with
others
always
and
the
acts
with
their
underlying
thoughts
have
relation
always
to
other
persons
and
to
ourselves
no
act
is
performed
without
a
thought
at
its
root
either
at
the
time
of
performance
or
as
leading
to
it
these
thoughts
are
lodged
in
that
part
of
man
which
we
have
called
mind
and
there
remain
as
subtle
but
powerful
links
with
magnetic
threads
that
enmesh
the
solar
system
and
through
which
various
effects
are
brought
out
the
theory
put
forward
in
earlier
pages
that
the
whole
system
to
which
this
globe
belongs
is
alive
conscious
on
every
plane
though
only
in
man
showing
comes
into
play
here
to
explain
how
the
thought
under
the
act
in
this
life
may
cause
result
in
this
or
the
next
birth
the
marvellous
modern
experiments
in
hypnotism
show
that
the
slightest
impression
no
matter
how
far
back
in
the
history
of
the
person
may
be
waked
up
to
life
thus
proving
it
is
not
lost
but
only
latent
take
for
instance
the
case
of
a
child
born
humpbacked
and
very
short
the
head
sunk
between
the
shoulders
the
arms
long
and
legs
curtailed
why
is
this
his
karma
for
thoughts
and
acts
in
a
prior
life
he
reviled
persecuted
or
otherwise
injured
a
deformed
person
so
persistently
or
violently
as
to
imprint
in
his
own
immortal
mind
the
deformed
picture
of
his
victim
for
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
of
his
thought
will
be
the
intensity
and
depth
of
the
picture
it
is
exactly
similar
to
the
exposure
of
the
sensitive
photographic
plate
whereby
just
as
the
exposure
is
long
or
short
the
impression
in
the
plate
is
weak
or
deep
so
this
thinker
and
again
to
rebirth
carries
with
him
this
picture
and
if
the
family
to
which
he
is
attracted
for
birth
has
similar
physical
tendencies
in
its
stream
the
mental
picture
causes
the
astral
body
to
assume
a
deformed
shape
by
electrical
and
magnetic
osmosis
through
the
mother
of
the
child
and
as
all
beings
on
earth
are
indissolubly
joined
together
the
misshapen
child
is
the
karma
of
the
parents
also
an
exact
consequence
for
similar
acts
and
thoughts
on
their
part
in
other
lives
here
is
an
exactitude
of
justice
which
no
other
theory
will
furnish
but
as
we
often
see
a
deformed
human
the
instance
merely
for
the
purpose
of
a
happy
disposition
an
excellent
intellect
sound
judgment
and
every
good
moral
quality
this
very
instance
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
karma
must
be
of
several
different
kinds
in
every
individual
case
and
also
evidently
operates
in
more
than
one
department
of
our
being
with
the
possibility
of
being
pleasant
in
effect
for
one
portion
of
our
nature
and
unpleasant
for
another
karma
is
of
three
sorts
which
has
not
begun
to
produce
any
effect
in
our
lives
owing
to
the
operation
on
us
of
some
other
karmic
causes
this
is
under
a
law
well
known
to
physicists
that
two
opposing
forces
tend
to
neutrality
and
that
one
force
may
be
strong
enough
to
temporarily
prevent
the
operation
of
another
one
this
law
works
on
the
unseen
mental
and
karmic
planes
or
spheres
of
being
just
as
it
does
on
the
material
ones
the
force
of
a
certain
set
of
bodily
mental
and
psychical
faculties
with
their
tendencies
may
wholly
inhibit
the
operation
on
us
of
causes
with
which
we
are
connected
because
the
whole
nature
of
each
person
is
used
in
the
carrying
out
of
this
law
hence
the
weak
and
mediocre
furnish
a
weak
focus
for
karma
and
in
them
the
general
result
of
a
lifetime
is
limited
although
they
may
feel
it
all
to
be
very
heavy
but
that
person
who
has
a
wide
and
character
and
much
force
will
feel
the
operation
of
a
greater
quantity
of
karma
than
the
weaker
person
karma
which
we
are
now
making
or
storing
up
by
our
thoughts
and
acts
and
which
will
operate
in
the
future
when
the
appropriate
body
mind
and
environment
are
taken
up
by
the
incarnating
ego
in
some
other
life
or
whenever
obstructive
karma
is
removed
this
bears
both
on
the
present
life
and
the
next
one
for
one
may
in
this
life
come
to
a
point
where
all
previous
causes
being
worked
out
new
karma
or
that
which
is
unexpended
must
begin
to
operate
under
this
are
those
cases
where
men
have
sudden
reverses
of
fortune
or
changes
for
the
better
either
in
circumstances
or
character
a
very
important
bearing
of
this
is
on
our
present
conduct
while
old
karma
must
work
out
and
can
not
be
stopped
it
is
wise
for
the
man
to
so
think
and
act
now
under
present
circumstances
no
matter
what
they
are
that
he
shall
produce
no
bad
or
prejudicial
causes
for
the
next
rebirth
or
for
later
years
in
this
life
rebellion
is
useless
for
the
law
works
on
whether
we
weep
or
rejoice
the
great
french
engineer
de
lesseps
is
a
good
example
of
this
class
of
karma
raised
to
a
high
pitch
of
glory
and
achievement
for
many
years
of
his
life
he
suddenly
falls
covered
with
shame
through
the
panama
canal
scandal
whether
he
was
innocent
or
guilty
he
has
the
shame
of
the
connection
of
his
name
with
a
national
enterprise
all
besmirched
with
bribery
and
corruption
that
involved
high
officials
this
was
the
operation
of
old
karmic
causes
on
him
the
very
moment
those
which
had
governed
his
previous
years
were
exhausted
napoleon
i
is
another
for
he
rose
to
a
very
great
fame
then
suddenly
fell
and
died
in
exile
and
disgrace
many
other
cases
will
occur
to
every
thoughtful
reader
karma
which
has
begun
to
produce
results
it
is
the
operating
now
in
this
life
on
us
of
causes
set
up
in
previous
lives
in
company
with
other
egos
and
it
is
in
operation
because
being
most
adapted
to
the
family
stock
the
individual
body
astral
body
and
race
tendencies
of
the
present
incarnation
it
exhibits
itself
plainly
while
other
unexpended
karma
awaits
its
regular
turn
these
three
classes
of
karma
govern
men
animals
worlds
and
periods
of
evolution
every
effect
flows
from
a
cause
precedent
and
as
all
beings
are
constantly
being
reborn
they
are
continually
experiencing
the
effects
of
their
thoughts
and
acts
which
are
themselves
causes
of
a
prior
incarnation
and
thus
each
one
answers
as
matthew
says
for
every
word
and
thought
none
can
escape
either
by
prayer
or
favor
or
force
or
any
other
intermediary
now
as
karmic
causes
are
divisible
into
three
classes
they
must
have
various
fields
in
which
to
work
they
operate
upon
man
in
his
mental
and
intellectual
nature
in
his
psychical
or
soul
nature
and
in
his
body
and
circumstances
the
spiritual
nature
of
man
is
never
affected
or
operated
upon
by
karma
one
species
of
karma
may
act
on
the
three
specified
planes
of
our
nature
at
the
same
time
to
the
same
degree
or
there
may
be
a
mixture
of
the
causes
some
on
one
plane
and
some
on
another
take
a
deformed
person
who
has
a
fine
mind
and
a
deficiency
in
his
soul
nature
here
punitive
or
unpleasant
karma
is
operating
on
his
body
while
in
his
mental
and
intellectual
nature
good
karma
is
being
experienced
but
psychically
the
karma
or
cause
being
of
an
indifferent
sort
the
result
is
indifferent
in
another
person
other
combinations
appear
he
has
a
fine
body
and
favorable
circumstances
but
the
character
is
morose
peevish
irritable
revengeful
morbid
and
disagreeable
to
himself
and
others
here
good
physical
karma
is
at
work
with
very
bad
mental
intellectual
and
psychical
karma
cases
will
occur
to
readers
of
persons
born
in
high
station
having
every
opportunity
and
power
yet
being
imbecile
or
suddenly
becoming
insane
and
just
as
all
these
phases
of
the
law
of
karma
have
sway
over
the
individual
man
so
they
similarly
operate
upon
races
nations
and
families
each
race
has
its
karma
as
a
whole
if
it
be
good
that
race
goes
forward
if
bad
it
goes
as
a
the
souls
concerned
take
up
their
karma
in
other
races
and
bodies
nations
can
not
escape
their
national
karma
and
any
nation
that
has
acted
in
a
wicked
manner
must
suffer
some
day
be
it
soon
or
late
the
karma
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
west
is
the
karma
of
israel
for
even
the
merest
tyro
can
see
that
the
mosaic
influence
is
the
strongest
in
the
european
and
american
nations
the
old
aztec
and
other
ancient
american
peoples
died
out
because
their
own
result
of
their
own
life
as
nations
in
the
far
upon
and
destroyed
them
with
nations
this
heavy
operation
of
karma
is
always
through
famine
war
convulsion
of
nature
and
the
sterility
of
the
women
of
the
nation
the
latter
cause
comes
near
the
end
and
sweeps
the
whole
remnant
away
and
the
individual
in
race
or
nation
is
warned
by
this
great
doctrine
that
if
he
falls
into
indifference
of
thought
and
act
thus
moulding
himself
into
the
general
average
karma
of
his
race
or
nation
that
national
and
race
karma
will
at
last
carry
him
off
in
the
general
destiny
this
is
why
teachers
of
old
cried
come
ye
out
and
be
ye
with
reïncarnation
the
doctrine
of
karma
explains
the
misery
and
suffering
of
the
world
and
no
room
is
left
to
accuse
nature
of
injustice
the
misery
of
any
nation
or
race
is
the
direct
result
of
the
thoughts
and
acts
of
the
egos
who
make
up
the
race
or
nation
in
the
dim
past
they
did
wickedly
and
now
suffer
they
violated
the
laws
of
harmony
the
immutable
rule
is
that
harmony
must
be
restored
if
violated
so
these
egos
suffer
in
making
compensation
and
establishing
the
equilibrium
of
the
occult
cosmos
the
whole
mass
of
egos
must
go
on
incarnating
and
reïncarnating
in
the
nation
or
race
until
they
have
all
worked
out
to
the
end
the
causes
set
up
though
the
nation
may
for
a
time
disappear
as
a
physical
thing
the
egos
that
made
it
do
not
leave
the
world
but
come
out
as
the
makers
of
some
new
nation
in
which
they
must
go
on
with
the
task
and
take
either
punishment
or
reward
as
accords
with
their
karma
of
this
law
the
old
egyptians
are
an
illustration
they
certainly
rose
to
a
high
point
of
development
and
as
certainly
they
were
extinguished
as
a
nation
but
the
old
on
and
are
now
fulfilling
their
destiny
as
some
other
nation
now
in
our
period
they
may
be
the
new
american
nation
or
the
jews
fated
to
wander
up
and
down
in
the
world
and
suffer
much
at
the
hands
of
others
this
process
is
perfectly
just
take
for
instance
the
united
states
and
the
red
indians
the
latter
have
been
most
shamefully
treated
by
the
nation
the
indian
egos
will
be
reborn
in
the
new
and
conquering
people
and
as
members
of
that
great
family
will
be
the
means
themselves
of
bringing
on
the
due
results
for
such
acts
as
were
done
against
them
when
they
had
red
bodies
thus
it
has
happened
before
and
so
it
will
come
about
again
individual
unhappiness
in
any
life
is
thus
explained
it
is
punishment
for
evil
done
in
past
lives
or
it
is
discipline
taken
up
by
the
ego
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
defects
or
acquiring
fortitude
and
sympathy
when
defects
are
eliminated
it
is
like
removing
the
obstruction
in
an
irrigating
canal
which
then
lets
the
water
flow
on
happiness
is
explained
in
the
same
way
the
result
of
prior
lives
of
goodness
the
scientific
and
basis
for
right
ethics
is
found
in
these
and
in
no
other
doctrines
for
if
right
ethics
are
to
be
practised
merely
for
themselves
men
will
not
see
why
and
have
never
been
able
to
see
why
for
that
reason
they
should
do
right
if
ethics
are
to
be
followed
from
fear
man
is
degraded
and
will
surely
evade
if
the
favor
of
the
almighty
not
based
on
law
or
justice
be
the
reason
then
we
will
have
just
what
prevails
code
given
by
jesus
to
the
west
professed
by
nations
and
not
practised
save
by
the
few
who
would
in
any
case
be
virtuous
on
this
subject
the
adepts
have
written
the
following
to
be
found
in
the
nor
would
the
ways
of
karma
be
inscrutable
were
men
to
work
in
union
and
harmony
instead
of
disunion
and
strife
for
our
ignorance
of
those
one
portion
of
mankind
calls
the
ways
of
providence
dark
and
intricate
while
another
sees
in
them
the
action
of
blind
fatalism
and
a
third
simple
chance
with
neither
gods
nor
devils
to
guide
surely
disappear
if
we
would
but
attribute
all
these
to
their
correct
cause
with
right
knowledge
or
at
any
rate
with
a
confident
conviction
that
our
neighbors
will
no
more
work
harm
to
us
than
we
would
think
of
harming
them
of
the
world
s
evil
would
vanish
into
thin
air
were
no
man
to
hurt
his
brother
would
have
neither
cause
to
work
for
nor
weapons
to
act
through
we
cut
these
numerous
windings
in
our
destinies
daily
with
our
own
hands
while
we
imagine
that
we
are
pursuing
a
track
on
the
royal
high
road
of
respectability
and
duty
and
then
complain
of
those
ways
being
so
intricate
and
so
dark
we
stand
bewildered
before
the
mystery
of
our
own
making
and
the
riddles
of
life
that
will
solve
and
then
accuse
the
great
sphinx
of
devouring
us
but
verily
there
is
not
an
accident
in
our
lives
not
a
misshapen
day
or
a
misfortune
that
could
not
be
traced
back
to
our
own
doings
in
this
or
another
life
knowledge
of
karma
gives
the
conviction
that
virtue
in
distress
and
vice
in
triumph
make
atheists
of
mankind
it
is
only
because
that
mankind
has
ever
shut
its
eyes
to
the
great
truth
that
man
is
himself
his
own
saviour
as
his
own
destroyer
that
he
need
not
accuse
heaven
and
the
gods
fates
and
providence
of
the
apparent
injustice
that
reigns
in
the
midst
of
humanity
but
let
him
rather
remember
and
repeat
this
bit
of
grecian
wisdom
which
warns
man
to
forbear
accusing
which
just
though
mysterious
leads
us
on
unerring
through
ways
unmarked
from
guilt
to
punishment
are
now
the
ways
and
the
high
road
on
which
move
onward
the
great
european
nations
the
western
aryans
had
every
nation
and
tribe
like
their
eastern
brethren
of
the
fifth
race
their
golden
and
their
iron
ages
their
period
of
comparative
irresponsibility
or
the
satya
age
of
purity
while
now
several
of
them
have
reached
their
iron
age
the
an
age
with
this
state
will
last
until
we
begin
acting
from
within
instead
of
ever
following
impulses
from
without
until
then
the
only
palliative
is
union
and
brotherhood
in
and
not
simply
in
name
chapter
xii
let
us
now
consider
the
states
of
man
after
the
death
of
the
body
and
before
birth
having
looked
over
the
whole
field
of
the
evolution
of
things
and
beings
in
a
general
way
this
brings
up
at
once
the
questions
is
there
any
heaven
or
hell
and
what
are
they
are
they
states
or
places
is
there
a
spot
in
space
where
they
may
be
found
and
to
which
we
go
or
from
where
we
come
we
must
also
go
back
to
the
subject
of
the
fourth
principle
of
the
constitution
of
man
that
called
kama
in
sanscrit
and
desire
or
passion
in
english
bearing
in
mind
what
was
said
about
that
principle
and
also
the
teaching
in
respect
to
the
astral
body
and
the
astral
light
it
will
be
easier
to
understand
what
is
taught
about
the
two
states
and
in
chronological
order
we
go
into
kama
the
plane
of
on
the
demise
of
the
body
and
then
the
higher
principles
the
real
man
fall
into
the
state
of
after
dealing
with
kama
loka
it
will
be
more
easy
to
study
the
question
of
the
breath
leaves
the
body
and
we
say
the
man
is
dead
but
that
is
only
the
beginning
of
death
it
proceeds
on
other
planes
when
the
frame
is
cold
and
eyes
closed
all
the
forces
of
the
body
and
mind
rush
through
the
brain
and
by
a
series
of
pictures
the
whole
life
just
ended
is
imprinted
indelibly
on
the
inner
man
not
only
in
a
general
outline
but
down
to
the
smallest
detail
of
even
the
most
minute
and
fleeting
impression
at
this
moment
though
every
indication
leads
the
physician
to
pronounce
for
death
and
though
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
person
is
dead
to
this
life
the
real
man
is
busy
in
the
brain
and
not
until
his
work
there
is
ended
is
the
person
gone
when
this
solemn
work
is
over
the
astral
body
detaches
itself
from
the
physical
and
life
energy
having
departed
the
remaining
five
principles
are
in
the
plane
of
kama
loka
the
natural
separation
of
the
principles
brought
about
by
death
divides
the
total
man
into
three
parts
the
visible
body
with
all
its
elements
left
to
further
disintegration
on
the
earth
plane
where
all
that
it
is
composed
of
is
in
time
resolved
into
the
different
physical
departments
of
nature
the
made
up
of
the
astral
body
and
the
passions
and
desires
which
also
begins
at
once
to
go
to
pieces
on
the
astral
plane
the
real
man
the
upper
triad
of
deathless
but
now
out
of
earth
conditions
devoid
of
body
begins
in
to
function
solely
as
mind
clothed
in
a
very
ethereal
vesture
which
it
will
shake
off
when
the
time
comes
for
it
to
return
to
earth
the
place
of
the
astral
region
penetrating
and
surrounding
the
earth
as
a
place
it
is
on
and
in
and
about
the
earth
its
extent
is
to
a
measurable
distance
from
the
earth
but
the
ordinary
laws
obtaining
here
do
not
obtain
there
and
entities
therein
are
not
under
the
same
conditions
as
to
space
and
time
as
we
are
as
a
state
it
is
metaphysical
though
that
metaphysic
relates
to
the
astral
plane
it
is
called
the
plane
of
desire
because
it
relates
to
the
fourth
principle
and
in
it
the
ruling
force
is
desire
devoid
of
and
divorced
from
intelligence
it
is
an
astral
sphere
intermediate
between
earthly
and
heavenly
life
beyond
any
doubt
it
is
the
origin
of
the
christian
theory
of
purgatory
where
the
soul
undergoes
penance
for
evil
done
and
from
which
it
can
be
released
by
prayer
and
other
ceremonies
or
offerings
the
fact
underlying
this
superstition
is
that
the
soul
may
be
detained
in
by
the
enormous
force
of
some
unsatisfied
desire
and
can
not
get
rid
of
the
astral
and
kamic
clothing
until
that
desire
is
satisfied
by
some
one
on
earth
or
by
the
soul
itself
but
if
the
person
was
pure
minded
and
of
high
aspirations
the
separation
of
the
principles
on
that
plane
is
soon
completed
permitting
the
higher
triad
to
go
into
being
the
purely
astral
sphere
it
partakes
of
the
nature
of
the
astral
matter
which
is
essentially
earthly
and
devilish
and
in
it
all
the
forces
work
undirected
by
soul
or
conscience
it
is
the
as
it
were
of
the
great
furnace
of
life
where
nature
provides
for
the
sloughing
off
of
elements
which
have
no
place
in
and
for
that
reason
it
must
have
many
degrees
every
one
of
which
was
noted
by
the
ancients
these
degrees
are
known
in
sanscrit
as
or
places
in
a
metaphysical
sense
human
life
is
very
varied
as
to
character
and
other
potentialities
and
for
each
of
these
the
appropriate
place
after
death
is
provided
thus
making
an
infinitely
varied
sphere
in
life
some
of
the
differences
among
men
are
modified
and
some
inhibited
by
a
similarity
of
body
and
heredity
but
in
all
the
hidden
desires
and
passions
are
let
loose
in
consequence
of
the
absence
of
body
and
for
that
reason
the
state
is
vastly
more
diversified
than
the
life
plane
not
only
is
it
necessary
to
provide
for
the
natural
varieties
and
differences
but
also
for
those
caused
by
the
manner
of
death
about
which
something
shall
be
said
and
all
these
various
divisions
are
but
the
natural
result
of
the
life
thoughts
and
last
thoughts
of
the
persons
who
die
on
earth
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
to
go
into
a
description
of
all
these
degrees
inasmuch
as
volumes
would
be
needed
to
describe
them
and
then
but
few
would
understand
to
deal
with
compels
us
to
deal
also
with
the
fourth
principle
in
the
classification
of
man
s
constitution
and
arouses
a
conflict
with
modern
ideas
and
education
on
the
subject
of
the
desires
and
passions
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
desires
and
passions
are
inherent
tendencies
in
the
individual
and
they
have
an
altogether
unreal
and
misty
appearance
for
the
ordinary
student
but
in
this
system
of
philosophy
they
are
not
merely
inherent
in
the
individual
nor
are
they
due
to
the
body
while
the
man
is
living
in
the
world
the
desires
and
principle
no
separate
life
apart
from
the
astral
and
inner
man
being
so
to
say
diffused
throughout
his
being
but
as
they
coalesce
with
the
astral
body
after
death
and
thus
form
an
entity
with
its
own
term
of
life
though
without
soul
very
important
questions
arise
during
mortal
life
the
desires
and
passions
are
guided
by
the
mind
and
soul
after
death
they
work
without
guidance
from
the
former
master
while
we
live
we
are
responsible
for
them
and
their
effects
and
when
we
have
left
this
life
we
are
still
responsible
although
they
go
on
working
and
making
effects
on
others
while
they
last
as
the
sort
of
entity
i
have
described
and
without
our
direct
guidance
in
this
is
seen
the
continuance
of
responsibility
they
are
a
portion
of
the
known
in
eastern
are
the
aggregates
that
make
up
the
man
the
body
includes
one
set
of
the
the
astral
man
another
the
principle
is
another
set
and
still
others
pertain
to
other
parts
in
are
the
really
active
and
important
ones
which
control
rebirths
and
lead
to
all
the
varieties
of
life
and
circumstance
upon
each
rebirth
they
are
being
made
from
day
to
day
under
the
law
that
every
thought
combines
instantly
with
one
of
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
becoming
to
that
extent
an
entity
which
will
endure
in
accordance
with
the
strength
of
the
thought
as
it
leaves
the
brain
and
all
of
these
are
inseparably
connected
with
the
being
who
evolved
them
there
is
no
way
of
escaping
all
we
can
do
is
to
have
thoughts
of
good
quality
for
the
highest
of
the
masters
themselves
are
not
exempt
from
this
law
but
they
people
their
current
in
space
with
entities
powerful
for
good
alone
now
in
this
mass
of
desire
and
thought
exists
very
definitely
until
the
conclusion
of
its
disintegration
and
then
the
remainder
consists
of
the
essence
of
these
connected
of
course
with
the
being
that
evolved
and
had
them
they
can
no
more
be
done
away
with
than
we
can
blot
out
the
universe
hence
they
are
said
to
remain
until
the
being
comes
out
of
and
then
at
once
by
the
law
of
attraction
they
are
drawn
to
the
being
who
from
them
as
germ
or
basis
builds
up
a
new
set
of
for
the
new
life
therefore
is
distinguished
from
the
earth
plane
by
reason
of
the
existence
therein
uncontrolled
and
unguided
of
the
mass
of
passions
and
desires
but
at
the
same
time
is
also
a
since
it
is
largely
governed
by
the
principle
and
will
be
so
until
at
a
far
distant
time
in
the
course
of
evolution
the
races
of
men
shall
have
developed
the
fifth
and
sixth
principles
thus
throwing
into
its
own
sphere
and
freeing
from
its
influence
the
astral
man
in
is
a
mere
shell
devoid
of
soul
and
mind
without
conscience
and
also
unable
to
act
unless
vivified
by
forces
outside
of
itself
it
has
that
which
seems
like
an
animal
or
automatic
consciousness
due
wholly
to
the
very
recent
association
with
the
human
ego
for
under
the
principle
laid
down
in
another
chapter
every
atom
going
to
make
up
the
man
has
a
memory
of
its
own
which
is
capable
of
lasting
a
length
of
time
in
proportion
to
the
force
given
it
in
the
case
of
a
very
material
and
gross
or
selfish
person
the
force
lasts
longer
than
in
any
other
and
hence
in
that
case
the
automatic
consciousness
will
be
more
definite
and
bewildering
to
one
who
without
knowledge
dabbles
with
necromancy
its
purely
astral
portion
contains
and
carries
the
record
of
all
that
ever
passed
before
the
person
when
living
for
one
of
the
qualities
of
the
astral
substance
is
to
absorb
all
scenes
and
pictures
and
the
impressions
of
all
thoughts
to
keep
them
and
to
throw
them
forth
by
reflection
when
the
conditions
permit
this
astral
shell
cast
off
by
every
man
at
death
would
be
a
menace
to
all
men
were
it
not
in
every
case
except
one
which
shall
be
mentioned
devoid
of
all
the
higher
principles
which
are
the
directors
but
those
guiding
constituents
being
disjoined
from
the
shell
it
wavers
and
floats
about
from
place
to
place
without
any
will
of
its
own
but
governed
wholly
by
attractions
in
the
astral
and
magnetic
fields
it
is
possible
for
the
real
the
spirit
by
communicate
with
us
immediately
after
death
for
a
few
brief
moments
but
those
passed
the
soul
has
no
more
to
do
with
earth
until
reïncarnated
what
can
and
do
influence
the
sensitive
and
the
medium
from
out
of
this
sphere
are
the
shells
i
have
described
soulless
and
conscienceless
these
in
no
sense
are
the
spirits
of
our
deceased
ones
they
are
the
clothing
thrown
off
by
the
inner
man
the
brutal
earthly
portion
discarded
in
the
flight
to
and
so
have
always
been
considered
by
the
ancients
as
personal
essentially
astral
earthly
and
passional
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
this
shell
after
being
for
so
long
the
vehicle
of
the
real
man
on
earth
did
not
retain
an
automatic
memory
and
consciousness
we
see
the
decapitated
body
of
the
frog
or
the
cock
moving
and
acting
for
a
time
with
a
seeming
intelligence
and
why
is
it
not
possible
for
the
finer
and
more
subtle
astral
form
to
act
and
move
with
a
far
greater
amount
of
seeming
mental
direction
existing
in
the
sphere
of
as
indeed
also
in
all
parts
of
the
globe
and
the
solar
system
are
the
elementals
or
nature
forces
they
are
innumerable
and
their
divisions
are
almost
infinite
as
they
are
in
a
sense
the
nerves
of
nature
each
class
has
its
own
work
just
as
has
every
natural
element
or
thing
as
fire
burns
and
as
water
runs
down
and
not
up
under
their
general
law
so
the
elementals
act
under
law
but
being
higher
in
the
scale
than
gross
fire
or
water
their
action
seems
guided
by
mind
some
of
them
have
a
special
relation
to
mental
operations
and
to
the
action
of
the
astral
organs
whether
these
be
joined
to
a
body
or
not
when
a
medium
forms
the
channel
and
also
from
other
natural
coördination
these
elementals
make
an
artificial
connection
with
the
shell
of
a
deceased
person
aided
by
the
nervous
fluid
of
the
medium
and
others
near
and
then
the
shell
is
galvanized
into
an
artificial
life
through
the
medium
connection
is
made
with
the
physical
and
psychical
forces
of
all
present
the
old
impressions
on
the
astral
body
give
up
their
images
to
the
mind
of
the
medium
the
old
passions
are
set
on
fire
various
messages
and
reports
are
then
obtained
from
it
but
not
one
of
them
is
original
not
one
is
from
the
spirit
by
their
strangeness
and
in
consequence
of
the
ignorance
of
those
who
dabble
in
it
this
is
mistaken
for
the
work
of
spirit
but
it
is
all
from
the
living
when
it
is
not
the
mere
picking
out
from
the
astral
light
of
the
images
of
what
has
been
in
the
past
in
certain
cases
to
be
noted
there
is
an
intelligence
at
work
that
is
wholly
and
intensely
bad
to
which
every
medium
is
subject
and
which
will
explain
why
so
many
of
them
have
succumbed
to
evil
as
they
have
confessed
a
rough
classification
of
these
shells
that
visit
mediums
would
be
as
follows
those
of
the
recently
deceased
whose
place
of
burial
is
not
far
away
this
class
will
be
quite
coherent
in
accordance
with
the
life
and
thought
of
the
former
owner
an
unmaterial
good
and
spiritualized
person
leaves
a
shell
that
will
soon
disintegrate
a
gross
mean
selfish
material
person
s
shell
will
be
heavy
consistent
and
long
lived
and
so
on
with
all
varieties
those
of
persons
who
had
died
far
away
from
the
place
where
the
medium
is
lapse
of
time
permits
such
to
escape
from
the
vicinity
of
their
old
bodies
and
at
the
same
time
brings
on
a
greater
degree
of
disintegration
which
corresponds
on
the
astral
plane
to
putrefaction
on
the
physical
these
are
vague
shadowy
incoherent
respond
but
briefly
to
the
psychic
stimulus
and
are
whirled
off
by
any
magnetic
current
they
are
galvanized
for
a
moment
by
the
astral
currents
of
the
medium
and
of
those
persons
present
who
were
related
to
the
deceased
purely
shadowy
remains
which
can
hardly
be
given
a
place
there
is
no
english
to
describe
them
though
they
are
facts
in
this
sphere
they
might
be
said
to
be
the
mere
mould
or
impress
left
in
the
astral
substance
by
the
once
coherent
shell
long
since
disintegrated
they
are
therefore
so
near
being
fictitious
as
to
almost
deserve
the
designation
as
such
shadowy
photographs
they
are
enlarged
decorated
and
given
an
imaginary
life
by
the
thoughts
desires
hopes
and
imaginings
of
medium
and
sitters
at
the
definite
coherent
entities
human
souls
bereft
of
the
spiritual
tie
now
tending
down
to
the
worst
state
of
all
where
annihilation
of
the
personality
is
the
end
they
are
known
as
black
magicians
having
centred
the
consciousness
in
the
principle
of
preserved
intellect
divorced
themselves
from
spirit
they
are
the
only
damned
beings
we
know
in
life
they
had
human
bodies
and
reached
their
awful
state
by
persistent
lives
of
evil
for
its
own
sake
some
of
such
already
doomed
to
become
what
i
have
described
are
among
us
on
earth
these
are
not
ordinary
shells
for
they
have
centred
all
their
force
in
thrown
out
every
spark
of
good
thought
or
aspiration
and
have
a
complete
mastery
of
the
astral
sphere
i
put
them
in
the
classification
of
shells
because
they
are
such
in
the
sense
that
they
are
doomed
to
disintegration
consciously
as
the
others
are
to
the
same
end
mechanically
only
they
may
and
do
last
for
many
centuries
gratifying
their
lusts
through
any
sensitive
they
can
lay
hold
of
where
bad
thought
gives
them
an
opening
they
preside
at
nearly
all
assuming
high
names
and
taking
the
direction
so
as
to
keep
the
control
and
continue
the
delusion
of
the
medium
thus
enabling
themselves
to
have
a
convenient
channel
for
their
own
evil
purposes
indeed
with
the
shells
of
suicides
of
those
poor
wretches
who
die
at
the
hand
of
the
law
of
drunkards
and
gluttons
these
black
magicians
living
in
the
astral
world
hold
the
field
of
physical
mediumship
and
are
liable
to
invade
the
sphere
of
any
medium
no
matter
how
good
the
door
once
open
it
is
open
to
all
this
class
of
shell
has
lost
higher
but
in
the
struggle
not
only
after
death
but
as
well
in
life
the
lower
portion
of
which
should
have
been
raised
up
to
godlike
excellence
was
torn
away
from
its
lord
and
now
gives
this
entity
intelligence
which
is
devoid
of
spirit
but
has
power
to
suffer
as
it
will
when
its
final
day
shall
come
in
the
state
of
suicides
and
those
who
are
suddenly
shot
out
of
life
by
accident
or
murder
legal
or
illegal
pass
a
term
almost
equal
to
the
length
life
would
have
been
but
for
the
sudden
termination
these
are
not
really
dead
to
bring
on
a
normal
death
a
factor
not
recognized
by
medical
science
must
be
present
that
is
the
principles
of
the
being
as
described
in
other
chapters
have
their
own
term
of
cohesion
at
the
natural
end
of
which
they
separate
from
each
other
under
their
own
laws
this
involves
the
great
subject
of
the
cohesive
forces
of
the
human
subject
requiring
a
book
in
itself
i
must
be
content
therefore
with
the
assertion
that
this
law
of
cohesion
obtains
among
the
human
principles
before
that
natural
end
the
principles
are
unable
to
separate
obviously
the
normal
destruction
of
the
cohesive
force
can
not
be
brought
about
by
mechanical
processes
except
in
respect
to
the
physical
body
hence
a
suicide
or
person
killed
by
accident
or
murdered
by
man
or
by
order
of
human
law
has
not
come
to
the
natural
termination
of
the
cohesion
among
the
other
constituents
and
is
hurled
into
the
state
only
partly
dead
there
the
remaining
principles
have
to
wait
until
the
actual
natural
life
term
is
reached
whether
it
be
one
month
or
sixty
years
but
the
degrees
of
provide
for
the
many
varieties
of
the
shells
some
pass
the
period
in
great
suffering
others
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
sleep
each
according
to
the
moral
responsibility
but
executed
criminals
are
in
general
thrown
out
of
life
full
of
hate
and
revenge
smarting
under
a
penalty
they
do
not
admit
the
justice
of
they
are
ever
rehearsing
in
their
crime
their
trial
their
execution
and
their
revenge
and
whenever
they
can
gain
touch
with
a
sensitive
living
person
medium
or
not
they
attempt
to
inject
thoughts
of
murder
and
other
crime
into
the
brain
of
such
unfortunate
and
that
they
succeed
in
such
attempts
the
deeper
students
of
theosophy
full
well
know
we
have
now
approached
after
a
certain
time
in
the
being
falls
into
a
state
of
unconsciousness
which
precedes
the
change
into
the
next
state
it
is
like
the
birth
into
life
preluded
by
a
term
of
darkness
and
heavy
sleep
it
then
wakes
to
the
joys
of
chapter
xiii
having
shown
that
just
beyond
the
threshold
of
human
life
there
is
a
place
of
separation
wherein
the
better
part
of
man
is
divided
from
his
lower
and
brute
elements
we
come
to
consider
what
is
the
state
after
death
of
the
real
being
the
immortal
who
travels
from
life
to
life
struggling
out
of
the
body
the
entire
man
goes
into
to
purgatory
where
he
again
struggles
and
loosens
himself
from
the
lower
this
period
of
birth
over
the
higher
principles
begin
to
think
in
a
manner
different
from
that
which
the
body
and
brain
permitted
in
life
this
is
the
state
of
a
sanscrit
word
meaning
literally
the
place
of
the
gods
where
the
soul
enjoys
felicity
but
as
the
gods
have
no
such
bodies
as
ours
the
self
in
is
devoid
of
a
mortal
body
in
the
ancient
books
it
is
said
that
this
state
lasts
for
years
of
infinite
number
or
for
a
period
proportionate
to
the
merit
of
the
being
and
when
the
mental
forces
peculiar
to
the
state
are
exhausted
the
being
is
drawn
down
again
to
be
reborn
in
the
world
of
mortals
is
therefore
an
interlude
between
births
in
the
world
the
law
of
karma
which
forces
us
all
to
enter
the
world
being
ceaseless
in
its
operation
and
also
universal
in
scope
acts
also
on
the
being
in
for
only
by
the
force
or
operation
of
karma
are
we
taken
out
of
it
is
something
like
the
pressure
of
atmosphere
which
being
continuous
and
uniform
will
push
out
or
crush
that
which
is
subjected
to
it
unless
there
be
a
compensating
quantity
of
atmosphere
to
counteract
the
pressure
in
the
present
case
the
karma
of
the
being
is
the
atmosphere
always
pressing
the
being
on
or
out
from
state
to
state
the
counteracting
quantity
of
atmosphere
is
the
force
of
the
being
s
own
and
aspirations
which
prevent
his
coming
out
of
until
that
force
is
exhausted
but
which
being
spent
has
no
more
power
to
hold
back
the
decree
of
our
mortal
destiny
the
necessity
for
this
state
after
death
is
one
of
the
necessities
of
evolution
growing
out
of
the
nature
of
mind
and
soul
the
very
nature
of
requires
a
devachanic
state
as
soon
as
the
body
is
lost
and
it
is
simply
the
effect
of
loosening
the
bonds
placed
upon
the
mind
by
its
physical
and
astral
encasement
in
life
we
can
but
to
a
fractional
extent
act
out
the
thoughts
we
have
each
moment
and
still
less
can
we
exhaust
the
psychic
energies
engendered
by
each
day
s
aspirations
and
dreams
the
energy
thus
engendered
is
not
lost
or
annihilated
but
is
stored
in
but
the
body
brain
and
astral
body
permit
no
full
development
of
the
force
hence
held
latent
until
death
it
bursts
then
from
the
weakened
bonds
and
plunges
the
thinker
into
the
expansion
use
and
development
of
the
set
up
in
life
the
impossibility
of
escaping
this
necessary
state
lies
in
man
s
ignorance
of
his
own
powers
and
faculties
from
this
ignorance
delusion
arises
and
not
being
wholly
free
is
carried
by
its
own
force
into
the
thinking
of
but
while
ignorance
is
the
cause
for
going
into
this
state
the
whole
process
is
remedial
restful
and
beneficial
for
if
the
average
man
returned
at
once
to
another
body
in
the
same
civilization
he
had
just
quitted
his
soul
would
be
completely
tired
out
and
deprived
of
the
needed
opportunity
for
the
development
of
the
higher
part
of
his
nature
now
the
ego
being
minus
mortal
body
and
clothes
itself
in
with
a
vesture
which
can
not
be
called
body
but
may
be
styled
means
or
vehicle
and
in
that
it
functions
in
the
devachanic
state
entirely
on
the
plane
of
mind
and
soul
everything
is
as
real
then
to
the
being
as
this
world
seems
to
be
to
us
it
simply
now
has
gotten
the
opportunity
to
make
its
own
world
for
itself
unhampered
by
the
clogs
of
physical
life
its
state
may
be
compared
to
that
of
the
poet
or
artist
who
rapt
in
ecstacy
of
composition
or
arrangement
of
color
cares
not
for
and
knows
not
of
either
time
or
objects
of
the
world
we
are
making
causes
every
moment
and
but
two
fields
exist
for
the
manifestation
in
effect
of
those
causes
these
are
the
objective
as
this
world
is
called
and
the
subjective
which
is
both
here
and
after
we
have
left
this
life
the
objective
field
relates
to
earth
life
and
the
grosser
part
of
man
to
his
bodily
acts
and
his
brain
thoughts
as
also
sometimes
to
his
astral
body
the
subjective
has
to
do
with
his
higher
and
spiritual
parts
in
the
objective
field
the
psychic
impulses
can
not
work
out
nor
can
the
high
leanings
and
aspirations
of
his
soul
hence
these
must
be
the
basis
cause
substratum
and
support
for
the
state
of
what
then
is
the
time
measured
by
mortal
years
that
one
will
stay
in
this
question
while
dealing
with
what
call
time
does
not
of
course
touch
the
real
meaning
of
time
itself
that
is
of
what
may
be
in
fact
for
this
solar
system
the
ultimate
order
precedence
succession
and
length
of
moments
it
is
a
question
which
may
be
answered
in
respect
to
our
time
but
not
certainly
in
respect
to
the
time
on
the
planet
mercury
for
instance
where
time
is
not
the
same
as
ours
nor
indeed
in
respect
to
time
as
conceived
by
the
soul
as
to
the
latter
any
man
can
see
that
after
many
years
have
slipped
away
he
has
no
direct
perception
of
the
time
just
passed
but
is
able
only
to
pick
out
some
of
the
incidents
which
marked
its
passage
and
as
to
some
poignant
or
happy
instants
or
hours
he
seems
to
feel
them
as
but
of
yesterday
and
thus
it
is
for
the
being
in
no
time
is
there
the
soul
has
all
the
benefit
of
what
goes
on
within
itself
in
that
state
but
it
indulges
in
no
speculations
as
to
the
lapse
of
moments
all
is
made
up
of
events
while
all
the
time
the
solar
orb
is
marking
off
the
years
for
us
on
the
earth
plane
this
can
not
be
regarded
as
an
impossibility
if
we
will
remember
how
as
is
well
known
in
life
events
pictures
thoughts
argument
introspective
feeling
will
all
sweep
over
us
in
perfect
detail
in
an
instant
or
as
is
known
of
those
who
have
been
drowning
the
events
of
a
whole
life
time
pass
in
a
flash
before
the
eye
of
the
mind
but
the
ego
remains
as
said
in
for
a
time
exactly
proportioned
to
the
psychic
impulses
generated
during
life
now
this
being
a
matter
which
deals
with
the
mathematics
of
the
soul
no
one
but
a
master
can
tell
what
the
time
would
be
for
the
average
man
of
this
century
in
every
land
hence
we
have
to
depend
on
the
masters
of
wisdom
for
that
average
as
it
must
be
based
upon
a
calculation
they
have
said
as
is
well
put
by
sinnett
in
his
that
the
period
is
fifteen
hundred
years
in
general
from
a
reading
of
his
book
which
was
made
up
from
letters
from
the
masters
it
is
to
be
inferred
he
desires
it
to
be
understood
that
the
devachanic
period
is
in
each
and
every
case
fifteen
centuries
but
to
do
away
with
that
misapprehension
his
informants
wrote
at
a
later
date
that
that
is
the
average
period
and
not
a
fixed
one
such
must
be
the
truth
for
as
we
see
that
men
differ
in
respect
to
the
periods
of
time
they
remain
in
any
state
of
mind
in
life
due
to
the
varying
intensities
of
their
thoughts
so
it
must
be
in
where
thought
has
a
greater
force
though
always
due
to
the
being
who
had
the
thoughts
what
the
master
did
say
on
this
is
as
follows
the
dream
of
lasts
until
karma
is
satisfied
in
that
direction
in
there
is
a
gradual
exhaustion
of
force
the
stay
in
is
proportionate
to
the
unexhausted
psychic
impulses
originated
in
earth
life
those
whose
actions
were
preponderatingly
material
will
be
sooner
brought
back
into
rebirth
by
the
force
of
is
the
thirst
for
life
he
therefore
who
has
not
in
life
originated
many
psychic
impulses
will
have
but
little
basis
or
force
in
his
essential
nature
to
keep
his
higher
principles
in
about
all
he
will
have
are
those
originated
in
childhood
before
he
began
to
fix
his
thoughts
on
materialistic
thinking
the
thirst
for
life
expressed
by
the
word
is
the
pulling
or
magnetic
force
lodged
in
the
inherent
in
all
beings
in
such
a
case
as
this
the
average
rule
does
not
apply
since
the
whole
effect
either
way
is
due
to
a
balancing
of
forces
and
is
the
outcome
of
action
and
reaction
and
this
sort
of
materialistic
thinker
may
emerge
out
of
into
another
body
here
in
a
month
allowing
for
the
unexpended
psychic
forces
originated
in
early
life
but
as
every
one
of
such
persons
varies
as
to
class
intensity
and
quantity
of
thought
and
psychic
impulse
each
may
vary
in
respect
to
the
time
of
stay
in
desperately
materialistic
thinkers
will
remain
in
the
devachanic
condition
stupefied
or
asleep
as
it
were
as
they
have
no
forces
in
them
appropriate
to
that
state
save
in
a
very
vague
fashion
and
for
them
it
can
be
very
truly
said
that
there
is
no
state
after
death
so
far
as
mind
is
concerned
they
are
torpid
for
a
while
and
then
they
live
again
on
earth
this
general
average
of
the
stay
in
gives
us
the
length
of
a
very
important
human
cycle
the
cycle
of
reïncarnation
for
under
that
law
national
development
will
be
found
to
repeat
itself
and
the
times
that
are
past
will
be
found
to
come
again
the
last
series
of
powerful
and
deeply
imprinted
thoughts
are
those
which
give
color
and
trend
to
the
whole
life
in
the
last
moment
will
color
each
subsequent
moment
on
those
the
soul
and
mind
fix
themselves
and
weave
of
them
a
whole
set
of
events
and
experiences
expanding
them
to
their
highest
limit
carrying
out
all
that
was
not
possible
in
life
thus
expanding
and
weaving
these
thoughts
the
entity
has
its
youth
and
growth
and
growing
old
that
is
the
uprush
of
the
force
its
expansion
and
its
dying
down
to
final
exhaustion
if
the
person
has
led
a
colorless
life
the
will
be
colorless
if
a
rich
life
then
it
will
be
rich
in
variety
and
effect
existence
there
is
not
a
dream
save
in
a
conventional
sense
for
it
is
a
stage
of
the
life
of
man
and
when
we
are
there
this
present
life
is
a
dream
it
is
not
in
any
sense
monotonous
we
are
too
prone
to
measure
all
possible
states
of
life
and
places
for
experience
by
our
present
earthly
one
and
to
imagine
it
to
be
reality
but
the
life
of
the
soul
is
endless
and
not
to
be
stopped
for
one
instant
leaving
our
physical
body
is
but
a
transition
to
another
place
or
plane
for
living
in
but
as
the
ethereal
garments
of
are
more
lasting
than
those
we
wear
here
the
spiritual
moral
and
psychic
causes
use
more
time
in
expanding
and
exhausting
in
that
state
than
they
do
on
earth
if
the
molecules
that
form
the
physical
body
were
not
subject
to
the
general
chemical
laws
that
govern
physical
earth
then
we
should
live
as
long
in
these
bodies
as
we
do
in
the
devachanic
state
but
such
a
life
of
endless
strain
and
suffering
would
be
enough
to
blast
the
soul
compelled
to
undergo
it
pleasure
would
then
be
pain
and
surfeit
would
end
but
in
an
immortal
insanity
nature
always
kind
leads
us
soon
again
into
heaven
for
a
rest

the

natures

then
neither

all
that
we

affect
those

for
their
good
not
only
in
the
moral
field
but
also
in
that

circumstance
this
is
possible
under
a
law
of
the
occult
universe
which
can
not
be
explained
now
with
profit
but
the
fact
may
be
stated
it
has
been
given
out
before
this
by
blavatsky
without
however
much
attention
being
drawn
to
it
the
last
question
to
consider
is
whether
we
here
can
reach
those
in
or
do
they
come
here
we
can
not
reach
them
nor
affect
them
unless
we
are
adepts
the
claim
of
mediums
to
hold
communion
with
the
spirits
of
the
dead
is
baseless
and
still
less
valid
is
the
claim
of
ability
to
help
those
who
have
gone
to
the
mahatma
a
being
who
has
developed
all
his
powers
and
is
free
from
illusion
can
go
into
the
devachanic
state
and
then
communicate
with
the
egos
there
such
is
one
of
their
functions
and
that
is
the
only
school
of
the
apostles
after
death
they
deal
with
certain
entities
in
for
the
purpose
of
getting
them
out
of
the
state
so
as
to
return
to
earth
for
the
benefit
of
the
race
the
egos
they
thus
deal
with
are
those
whose
nature
is
great
and
deep
but
who
are
not
wise
enough
to
be
able
to
overcome
the
natural
illusions
of
sometimes
also
the
hypersensitive
and
pure
medium
goes
into
this
state
and
then
holds
communication
with
the
egos
there
but
it
is
rare
and
certainly
will
not
take
place
with
the
general
run
of
mediums
who
trade
for
money
but
the
soul
never
descends
here
to
the
medium
and
the
gulf
between
the
consciousness
of
and
that
of
earth
is
so
deep
and
wide
that
it
is
but
seldom
the
medium
can
remember
upon
returning
to
recollection
here
what
or
whom
it
met
or
saw
or
heard
in
this
gulf
is
similar
to
that
which
separates
from
rebirth
it
is
one
in
which
all
memory
of
what
preceded
it
is
blotted
out

whole
period
allotted
by
the

forces

to
assert
their
power
the
self
wakes
from
the
dream
it
is
borne
swiftly
off
to
a
new
body
and
then
just
before
birth
it
sees
for
a
moment
all
the
causes
that
led
it
to
and
back
to
the
life
it
is
about
to
begin
and
knowing
it
to
be
all
just
to
be
the
result
of
its
own
past
life
it

not
but

up

for
some
centuries
suspected
that
events
move
in
cycles
and
a
few
of
the
writers
in
the
field
of
european
literature
have
dealt
with
the
subject
but
all
in
a
very
incomplete
fashion
this
incompleteness
and
want
of
accurate
knowledge
have
been
due
to
the
lack
of
belief
in
spiritual
things
and
the
desire
to
square
everything
with
materialistic
science
nor
do
i
pretend
to
give
the
cyclic
law
in
full
for
it
is
one
that
is
not
given
out
in
detail
by
the
masters
of
wisdom
but
enough
has
been
divulged
and
enough
was
for
a
long
time
known
to
the
ancients
to
add
considerably
to
our
knowledge
a
cycle
is
a
ring
or
turning
as
the
derivation
of
the
word
indicates
the
corresponding
words
in
the
sanscrit
are
but
of
these
comes
nearest
to
cycle
as
it
is
lesser
in
duration
than
the
others
the
beginning
of
a
cycle
must
be
a
moment
that
added
to
other
moments
makes
a
day
and
those
added
together
constitute
months
years
decades
and
centuries
beyond
this
the
west
hardly
goes
it
recognizes
the
moon
cycle
and
the
great
sidereal
one
but
looks
at
both
and
upon
the
others
merely
as
periods
of
time
if
we
are
to
consider
them
as
but
lengths
of
time
there
is
no
profit
except
to
the
dry
student
or
to
the
astronomer
and
in
this
way
they
are
regarded
by
european
and
american
thinkers
who
say
cycles
exist
but
have
no
very
great
bearing
on
human
life
and
certainly
no
bearing
on
the
actual
recurrence
of
events
or
the
reäppearance
on
the
stage
of
life
of
persons
who
once
lived
in
the
world
the
theosophical
theory
is
distinctly
otherwise
as
it
must
be
if
it
carries
out
the
doctrine
of
reïncarnation
to
which
in
preceding
pages
a
good
deal
of
attention
has
been
given
not
only
are
the
cycles
named
actual
physical
facts
in
respect
to
time
but
they
and
other
periods
have
a
very
great
effect
on
human
life
and
the
evolution
of
the
globe
with
all
the
forms
of
life
thereon
starting
with
the
moment
and
proceeding
through
a
day
this
theory
erects
the
cycle
into
a
comprehensive
ring
which
includes
all
in
its
limits
the
moment
being
the
basis
the
question
to
be
settled
in
respect
to
the
great
cycles
is
when
did
the
first
moment
come
this
can
not
be
answered
but
it
can
be
said
that
the
truth
is
held
by
the
ancient
theosophists
to
be
that
at
the
first
moments
of
the
solidification
of
this
globe
the
mass
of
matter
involved
attained
a
certain
and
definite
rate
of
vibration
which
will
hold
through
all
variations
in
any
part
of
it
until
its
hour
for
dissolution
comes
these
rates
of
vibration
are
what
determine
the
different
cycles
and
contrary
to
the
ideas
of
western
science
the
doctrine
is
that
the
solar
system
and
the
globe
we
are
now
on
will
come
to
an
end
when
the
force
behind
the
whole
mass
of
seen
and
unseen
matter
has
reached
its
limit
of
duration
under
cyclic
law
here
our
doctrine
is
again
different
from
both
the
religious
and
scientific
one
we
do
not
admit
that
the
ending
of
the
force
is
the
withdrawal
by
a
god
of
his
protection
nor
the
sudden
propulsion
by
him
of
another
force
against
the
globe
but
that
the
force
at
work
and
determining
the
great
cycle
is
that
of
man
himself
considered
as
a
spiritual
being
when
he
is
done
using
the
globe
he
leaves
it
and
then
with
him
goes
out
the
force
holding
all
together
the
consequence
is
dissolution
by
fire
or
water
or
what
not
these
phenomena
being
simply
effects
and
not
causes
the
ordinary
scientific
speculations
on
this
head
are
that
the
earth
may
fall
into
the
sun
or
that
a
comet
of
density
may
destroy
the
globe
or
that
we
may
collide
with
a
greater
planet
known
or
unknown
these
dreams
are
idle
for
the
present
reïncarnation
being
the
great
law
of
life
and
progress
it
is
interwoven
with
that
of
the
cycles
and
karma
these
three
work
together
and
in
practice
it
is
almost
impossible
to
disentangle
reïncarnation
from
cyclic
law
individuals
and
nations
in
definite
streams
return
in
regularly
recurring
periods
to
the
earth
and
thus
bring
back
to
the
globe
the
arts
the
civilization
the
very
persons
who
once
were
on
it
at
work
and
as
the
units
in
nation
and
race
are
connected
together
by
invisible
strong
threads
large
bodies
of
such
units
moving
slowly
but
surely
all
together
reunite
at
different
times
and
emerge
again
and
again
together
into
new
race
and
new
civilization
as
the
cycles
roll
their
appointed
rounds
therefore
the
souls
who
made
the
most
ancient
civilizations
will
come
back
and
bring
the
old
civilization
with
them
in
idea
and
essence
which
being
added
to
what
others
have
done
for
the
development
of
the
human
race
in
its
character
and
knowledge
will
produce
a
new
and
higher
state
of
civilization
this
newer
and
better
development
will
not
be
due
to
books
to
records
to
arts
or
mechanics
because
all
those
are
periodically
destroyed
so
far
as
physical
evidence
goes
but
the
soul
ever
retaining
in
the
knowledge
it
once
gained
and
always
pushing
to
completer
development
the
higher
principles
and
powers
the
essence
of
progress
remains
and
will
as
surely
come
out
as
the
sun
shines
and
along
this
road
are
the
points
when
the
small
and
large
cycles
of
avatars
bring
out
for
man
s
benefit
the
great
characters
who
mould
the
race
from
time
to
time
the
cycle
of
avatars
includes
several
smaller
ones
the
greater
are
those
marked
by
the
appearance
of
rama
and
krishna
among
the
hindus
of
menes
among
the
egyptians
of
zoroaster
among
the
persians
and
of
buddha
to
the
hindus
and
other
nations
of
the
east
buddha
is
the
last
of
the
great
avatars
and
is
in
a
larger
cycle
than
is
jesus
of
the
jews
for
the
teachings
of
the
latter
are
the
same
as
those
of
buddha
and
tinctured
with
what
buddha
had
taught
to
those
who
instructed
jesus
another
great
avatar
is
yet
to
come
corresponding
to
buddha
and
krishna
combined
krishna
and
rama
were
of
the
military
civil
religious
and
occult
order
buddha
of
the
ethical
religious
and
mystical
in
which
he
was
followed
by
jesus
mohammed
was
a
minor
intermediate
one
for
a
certain
part
of
the
race
and
was
civil
military
and
religious
in
these
cycles
we
can
include
mixed
characters
who
have
had
great
influence
on
nations
such
as
king
arthur
pharaoh
moses
charlemagne
reïncarnated
as
napoleon
buonaparte
clovis
of
france
reborn
as
emperor
frederic
iii
of
germany
and
washington
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
where
the
root
for
the
new
race
is
being
formed
at
the
intersection
of
the
great
cycles
dynamic
effects
follow
and
alter
the
surface
of
the
planet
by
reason
of
the
shifting
of
the
poles
of
the
globe
or
other
convulsion
this
is
not
a
theory
generally
acceptable
but
we
hold
it
to
be
true
man
is
a
great
dynamo
making
storing
and
throwing
out
energy
and
when
masses
of
men
composing
a
race
thus
make
and
distribute
energy
there
is
a
resulting
dynamic
effect
on
the
material
of
the
globe
which
will
be
powerful
enough
to
be
distinct
and
cataclysmic
that
there
have
been
vast
and
awful
disturbances
in
the
strata
of
the
world
is
admitted
on
every
hand
and
now
needs
no
proof
these
have
been
due
to
earthquakes
and
ice
formation
so
far
as
concerns
geology
but
in
respect
to
animal
forms
the
cyclic
law
is
that
certain
animal
forms
now
extinct
and
also
certain
human
ones
not
known
but
sometimes
suspected
will
return
again
in
their
own
cycle
and
certain
human
languages
now
known
as
dead
will
be
in
use
once
more
at
their
appointed
cyclic
hour
the
metonic
cycle
is
that
of
the
moon
it
is
a
period
of
about
nineteen
years
which
being
completed
the
new
and
the
full
moons
return
on
the
same
days
of
the
the
cycle
of
the
sun
is
a
period
of
twenty
eight
years
which
having
elapsed
the
dominical
or
sunday
letters
return
to
their
former
place
and
proceed
in
the
former
order
according
to
the
julian
the
great
sidereal
year
is
the
period
taken
by
the
equinoctial
points
to
make
in
their
precession
a
complete
revolution
of
the
heavens
it
is
composed
of
solar
years
almost
it
is
said
that
the
last
sidereal
year
ended
about
years
ago
at
which
time
there
must
have
been
on
this
earth
a
violent
convulsion
or
series
of
such
as
well
as
distributions
of
nations
the
completion
of
this
grand
period
brings
the
earth
into
newer
spaces
of
the
cosmos
not
in
respect
to
its
own
orbit
but
by
reason
of
the
actual
progress
of
the
sun
in
an
orbit
of
its
own
that
can
not
be
measured
by
any
observer
of
the
present
day
but
which
is
guessed
at
by
some
and
located
in
one
of
the
constellations
affecting
man
especially
are
the
spiritual
psychic
and
moral
cycles
and
out
of
these
grow
the
national
racial
and
individual
cycles
race
and
national
cycles
are
both
historical
the
individual
cycles
are
of
reïncarnation
of
sensation
and
of
impression
the
length
of
the
individual
reïncarnation
cycle
for
the
general
mass
of
men
is
fifteen
hundred
years
and
this
in
its
turn
gives
us
a
large
historical
cycle
related
closely
to
the
progress
of
civilization
for
as
the
masses
of
persons
return
from
it
must
follow
that
the
roman
the
greek
the
old
aryan
and
other
ages
will
be
seen
again
and
can
to
a
very
great
extent
be
plainly
traced
but
man
is
also
affected
by
astronomical
cycles
because
he
is
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
and
these
cycles
mark
the
periods
when
mankind
as
a
whole
will
undergo
a
change
in
the
sacred
books
of
all
nations
these
are
often
mentioned
and
are
in
the
bible
of
the
christians
as
for
instance
in
the
story
of
jonah
in
the
belly
of
the
whale
this
is
an
absurdity
when
read
as
history
but
not
so
as
an
astronomical
cycle
jonah
is
in
the
constellations
and
when
that
astronomical
point
which
represents
man
reaches
a
point
in
the
zodiac
which
is
directly
opposite
the
belly
of
cetus
or
the
whale
on
the
other
side
of
the
circle
by
what
is
known
as
the
process
of
opposition
then
jonah
is
said
to
be
in
the
centre
of
the
fish
and
is
thrown
out
at
the
expiration
of
the
period
when
that
has
passed
so
far
along
in
the
zodiac
as
to
be
out
of
opposition
to
the
whale
similarly
as
the
same
point
moves
thus
through
the
zodiac
it
is
brought
by
opposition
into
the
different
constellations
that
are
exactly
opposite
from
century
to
century
while
it
moves
along
during
these
progresses
changes
take
place
among
men
and
on
earth
exactly
signified
by
the
constellations
when
those
are
read
according
to
the
right
rules
of
symbology
it
is
not
claimed
that
the
conjunction
causes
the
effect
but
that
ages
ago
the
masters
of
wisdom
worked
out
all
the
problems
in
respect
to
man
and
found
in
the
heavens
the
means
for
knowing
the
exact
dates
when
events
are
sure
to
recur
and
then
by
imprinting
in
the
minds
of
older
nations
the
symbology
of
the
zodiac
were
able
to
preserve
the
record
and
the
prophecy
thus
in
the
same
way
that
a
watchmaker
can
tell
the
hour
by
the
arrival
of
the
hands
or
the
works
of
the
watch
at
certain
fixed
points
the
sages
can
tell
the
hour
for
events
by
the
zodiacal
clock
this
is
not
of
course
believed
but
it
will
be
well
understood
in
future
centuries
and
as
the
nations
of
the
earth
have
all
similar
symbols
in
general
for
the
zodiac
and
as
also
the
records
of
races
long
dead
have
the
same
it
is
not
likely
that
the
of
the
western
nineteenth
century
will
be
able
to
efface
this
valuable
heritage
of
our
evolution
in
egypt
the
denderah
zodiac
tells
the
same
tale
as
that
one
left
to
us
by
the
old
civilization
of
the
american
continent
and
all
of
these
are
from
the
same
source
they
are
the
work
of
the
sages
who
come
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
human
cycle
and
give
to
man
when
he
begins
his
toilsome
ascent
up
the
road
of
development
those
great
symbols
and
ideas
of
an
astronomical
character
which
will
last
through
all
the
cycles
in
regard
to
great
cataclysms
occurring
at
the
beginning
and
ending
of
the
great
cycles
the
main
laws
governing
the
effects
are
those
of
karma
and
reëmbodiment
or
reïncarnation
proceeding
under
cyclic
rule
not
only
is
man
ruled
by
these
laws
but
every
atom
of
matter
as
well
and
the
mass
of
matter
is
constantly
undergoing
a
change
at
the
same
time
with
man
it
must
therefore
exhibit
alterations
corresponding
to
those
through
which
the
thinker
is
going
on
the
physical
plane
effects
are
brought
out
through
the
electrical
and
other
fluids
acting
with
the
gases
on
the
solids
of
the
globe
at
the
change
of
a
great
cycle
they
reach
what
may
be
termed
the
exploding
point
and
cause
violent
convulsions
of
the
following
classes
earthquakes
floods
fire
ice
earthquakes
may
be
brought
on
according
to
this
philosophy
by
two
general
causes
subsidence
or
elevation
under
the
due
to
heat
and
steam
electrical
and
magnetic
changes
which
affect
water
and
earth
at
the
same
time
these
last
have
the
power
to
instantaneously
make
the
earth
fluidic
without
melting
it
thus
causing
immense
and
violent
displacements
in
large
or
small
waves
and
this
effect
is
sometimes
seen
now
in
earthquake
districts
when
similar
electrical
causes
are
at
work
in
a
smaller
measure
floods
of
general
extent
are
caused
by
displacement
of
water
from
the
subsidence
or
elevation
of
land
and
by
those
combined
with
electrical
change
which
induces
a
copious
discharge
of
moisture
the
latter
is
not
a
mere
emptying
of
a
cloud
but
a
sudden
turning
of
vast
bodies
of
fluids
and
solids
into
water
universal
fires
come
on
from
electrical
and
magnetic
changes
in
the
atmosphere
by
which
the
moisture
is
withdrawn
from
the
air
and
the
latter
turned
into
a
fiery
mass
and
secondly
by
the
sudden
expansion
of
the
solar
magnetic
centre
into
seven
such
centres
thus
burning
the
globe
ice
cataclysms
come
on
not
only
from
the
sudden
alteration
of
the
poles
but
also
from
lowered
temperature
due
to
the
alteration
of
the
warm
fluid
currents
in
the
sea
and
the
hot
magnetic
currents
in
the
earth
the
first
being
known
to
science
the
latter
not
the
lower
stratum
of
moisture
is
suddenly
frozen
and
vast
tracts
of
land
covered
in
a
night
with
many
feet
of
ice
this
can
easily
happen
to
the
british
isles
if
the
warm
currents
of
the
ocean
are
diverted
from
its
shores
both
egyptians
and
greeks
had
their
cycles
but
in
our
opinion
derived
them
from
the
indian
sages
the
chinese
always
were
a
nation
of
astronomers
and
have
recorded
observations
reaching
far
back
of
the
christian
era
but
as
they
belong
to
an
old
race
which
is
doomed
to
as
the
assertion
may
conclusions
will
not
be
correct
for
the
aryan
races
on
the
coming
of
the
christian
era
a
heavy
pall
of
darkness
fell
on
the
minds
of
men
in
the
west
and
india
was
for
many
centuries
isolated
so
as
to
preserve
these
great
ideas
during
the
mental
night
of
europe
this
isolation
was
brought
about
deliberately
as
a
necessary
precaution
taken
by
that
great
lodge
to
which
i
adverted
in
chapter
i
because
its
adepts
knowing
the
cyclic
laws
perfectly
wished
to
preserve
philosophy
for
future
generations
as
it
would
be
mere
pedantry
and
speculation
to
discuss
the
unknown
saros
and
naros
and
other
cycles
of
the
egyptians
i
will
give
the
brahmanical
ones
since
they
tally
almost
exactly
with
the
correct
periods
a
period
or
exhibition
of
universal
manifestation
is

at

as
some
races
are

others
are

prejudice

at

we
are

chapter
xv
between
science
and
theosophy
there
is
a
wide
gulf
for
the
present
unbridged
on
the
question
of
the
origin
of
man
and
the
differentiation
of
species
the
teachers
of
religion
in
the
west
offer
on
this
subject
a
theory
dogmatically
buttressed
by
an
assumed
revelation
as
impossible
as
the
one
put
forward
by
scientific
men
and
yet
the
religious
expounders
are
nearer
than
science
to
the
truth
under
the
religious
superstition
about
adam
and
eve
is
hidden
the
truth
and
in
the
tales
of
cain
seth
and
noah
is
vaguely
shadowed
the
real
story
of
the
other
races
of
men
adam
being
but
the
representative
of
one
single
race
the
people
who
received
cain
and
gave
him
a
wife
were
some
of
those
human
races
which
had
appeared
simultaneously
with
the
one
headed
by
adam
the
ultimate
origin
or
beginning
of
man
is
not
to
be
discovered
although
we
may
know
when
and
from
where
the
men
of
this
globe
came
man
never
was
not
if
not
on
this
globe
then
on
some
others
he
ever
was
and
will
ever
be
in
existence
somewhere
in
the
cosmos
ever
perfecting
and
reaching
up
to
the
image
of
the
heavenly
man
he
is
always
becoming
but
as
the
human
mind
can
not
go
back
to
any
beginning
we
shall
start
with
this
globe
upon
this
earth
and
upon
the
whole
chain
of
globes
of
which
it
is
a
part
seven
races
of
men
appeared
simultaneously
coming
over
to
it
from
other
globes
of
an
older
chain
and
in
respect
to
this
fourth
of
this
seven
races
came
simultaneously
from
another
globe
of
this
chain
this
appearance
of
seven
races
together
happens
in
the
first
and
in
part
of
the
second
round
of
the
globes
in
the
second
round
the
seven
masses
of
beings
are
amalgamated
and
their
destiny
after
that
is
to
slowly
differentiate
during
the
succeeding
rounds
until
at
the
seventh
round
the
seven
first
great
races
will
be
once
more
distinct
as
perfect
types
of
the
human
race
as
this
period
of
evolution
will
allow
at
the
present
time
the
seven
races
are
mixed
together
and
representatives
of
all
are
in
the
many
races
of
men
as
classified
by
our
present
science
the
object
of
this
amalgamation
and
subsequent
differentiation
is
to
give
to
every
race
the
benefit
of
the
progress
and
power
of
the
whole
derived
from
prior
progress
in
other
planets
and
systems
for
nature
never
does
her
work
in
a
hasty
or
undue
fashion
but
by
the
sure
method
of
mixture
precipitation
and
separation
brings
about
the
greatest
perfection
and
this
method
was
one
known
to
the
alchemists
though
not
fully
understood
in
all
its
bearings
even
by
them
hence
man
did
not
spring
from
a
single
pair
neither
did
he
come
from
any
tribe
or
family
of
monkey
it
is
hopeless
to
look
to
either
religion
or
science
for
a
solution
of
the
question
for
science
is
confused
on
her
own
admission
and
religion
is
tangled
with
a
revelation
that
in
its
books
controverts
the
theory
put
forward
by
the
priest
adam
is
called
the
first
man
but
the
record
in
which
the
story
is
found
shows
that
other
races
of
men
must
have
existed
on
the
earth
before
cain
could
have
founded
a
city
the
bible
then
does
not
support
the
single
pair
theory
if
we
take
up
one
of
the
hypotheses
of
science
and
admit
for
the
moment
that
man
and
monkey
differentiated
from
one
ancestor
we
have
then
to
decide
where
the
first
ancestor
came
from
the
first
postulate
of
the
lodge
on
this
subject
is
that
seven
races
of
men
appeared
simultaneously
on
the
earth
and
the
first
negative
assumption
is
that
man
did
not
spring
from
a
single
pair
or
from
the
animal
kingdom
the
varieties
of
character
and
capacity
which
subsequently
appear
in
man
s
history
are
the
forthcoming
of
the
variations
which
were
induced
in
the
egos
in
other
and
long
anterior
periods
of
evolution
upon
other
chains
of
globes
these
variations
were
so
deeply
impacted
as
to
be
equivalent
to
inherent
characteristics
for
the
races
of
this
globe
the
prior
period
of
evolution
was
passed
on
the
chain
of
globes
of
which
our
moon
is
the
visible
representative
the
burning
question
of
the
anthropoid
apes
as
related
to
man
is
settled
by
the
masters
of
wisdom
who
say
that
instead
of
those
being
our
progenitors
they
were
produced
by
man
himself
in
one
of
the
early
periods
of
the
globe
the
men
of
that
time
begot
from
large
females
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
anthropoids
and
in
anthropoid
bodies
were
caught
a
certain
number
of
egos
destined
one
day
to
be
men
the
remainder
of
the
descendants
of
the
true
anthropoid
are
the
descendants
of
those
illegitimate
children
of
men
and
will
die
away
gradually
their
egos
entering
human
bodies
those
and
bodies
could
not
be
ensouled
by
strictly
animal
egos
and
for
that
reason
they
are
known
to
the
secret
doctrine
as
the
delayed
race
the
only
one
not
included
in
the
fiat
of
nature
that
no
more
egos
from
the
lower
kingdoms
will
come
into
the
human
kingdom
until
the
next
but
to
all
kingdoms
below
man
except
the
anthropoids
the
door
is
now
closed
for
entry
into
the
human
stage
and
the
egos
in
the
subordinate
forms
must
all
wait
their
turn
in
the
succeeding
great
cycle
and
as
the
delayed
egos
of
the
anthropoid
family
will
emerge
into
the
man
stage
later
on
they
will
thus
be
rewarded
for
the
long
wait
in
that
degraded
race
all
the
other
monkeys
are
products
in
the
ordinary
manner
of
the
evolutionary
processes
on
this
subject
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
the
words
of
one
of
those
masters
of
wisdom
giving
the
esoteric
anthropology
from
the
secret
volumes
thus
the
anatomical
resemblance
between
man
and
the
higher
ape
so
frequently
cited
by
the
darwinists
as
pointing
to
some
former
ancestor
common
to
both
presents
an
interesting
problem
the
proper
solution
of
which
is
to
be
sought
for
in
the
esoteric
explanation
of
the
genesis
of
the
pithecoid
stocks
we
have
given
it
so
far
as
was
useful
by
stating
that
the
bestiality
of
the
primeval
mindless
races
resulted
in
the
production
of
huge
offspring
of
human
and
animal
parents
as
time
rolled
on
and
the
still
forms
consolidated
into
the
physical
the
descendants
of
these
creatures
were
modified
by
external
conditions
until
the
breed
dwindling
in
size
culminated
in
the
lower
apes
of
the
miocene
period
with
these
the
later
atlanteans
renewed
the
sin
of
the
mindless
time
with
full
responsibility
the
resultants
of
their
crime
were
the
species
now
known
as
the
anthropoid
let
us
remember
the
esoteric
teaching
which
tells
us
of
man
having
had
in
the
third
round
a
gigantic
form
on
the
astral
plane
and
similarly
at
the
close
of
the
third
race
in
this
round
thus
it
accounts
for
the
human
features
of
the
apes
especially
of
the
later
anthropoids
from
the
fact
that
these
latter
preserved
by
heredity
a
resemblance
to
their
sires
the
same
teachers
furthermore
assert
that
the
mammalian
types
were
produced
in
the
fourth
round
subsequent
to
the
appearance
of
the
human
types
for
this
reason
there
was
no
barrier
against
fertility
because
the
of
those
mammals
were
not
far
enough
removed
to
raise
the
natural
barrier
the
unnatural
union
in
the
third
race
when
man
had
not
yet
had
the
light
of
given
to
him
was
not
a
crime
against
nature
since
no
mind
being
present
save
in
the
merest
germ
no
responsibility
could
attach
but
in
the
fourth
round
the
light
of
being
present
the
renewal
of
the
act
by
the
new
race
was
a
crime
because
it
was
done
with
a
full
knowledge
of
the
consequences
and
against
the
warning
of
conscience
the
karmic
effect
of
this
including
as
it
does
all
races
has
yet
to
be
fully
felt
and
a
much
later
day
than
now
as
man
came
to
this
globe
from
another
planet
though
of
course
then
a
being
of
very
great
power
before
being
completely
enmeshed
in
matter
so
the
lower
kingdoms
came
likewise
in
germ
and
type
from
other
planets
and
carry
on
their
evolution
step
by
step
upward
by
the
aid
of
man
who
is
in
all
periods
of
manifestation
at
the
front
of
the
wave
of
life
the
egos
in
these
lower
kingdoms
could
not
finish
their
evolution
in
the
preceding
before
its
dissolution
and
coming
to
this
they
go
forward
age
after
age
gradually
approaching
nearer
the
man
stage
one
day
they
too
will
become
men
and
act
as
the
advance
guard
and
guide
for
other
lower
kingdoms
of
this
or
other
globes
and
in
the
coming
from
the
former
planet
there
are
always
brought
with
the
first
and
highest
class
of
beings
some
forms
of
animal
life
some
fruits
and
other
products
as
models
or
types
for
use
here
it
will
not
be
profitable
to
go
into
this
here
with
particularity
for
being
too
far
ahead
of
the
time
it
would
evoke
only
ridicule
from
some
and
stupidity
from
others
but
the
general
forms
of
the
various
kingdoms
being
so
brought
over
we
have
next
to
consider
how
the
differentiation
of
animal
and
other
lower
species
began
and
was
carried
on
this
is
the
point
where
intelligent
aid
and
interference
from
a
mind
or
mass
of
minds
is
absolutely
necessary
such
aid
and
interference
was
and
is
the
fact
for
nature
unaided
can
not
do
the
work
right
but
i
do
not
mean
that
god
or
angel
interferes
and
aids
it
is
man
who
does
this
not
the
man
of
the
day
weak
and
ignorant
as
he
is
but
great
souls
high
and
holy
men
of
immense
power
knowledge
and
wisdom
just
such
as
every
man
would
now
know
he
could
become
if
it
were
not
that
religion
on
one
hand
and
science
on
the
other
have
painted
such
a
picture
of
our
weakness
inherent
evil
and
purely
material
origin
that
nearly
all
men
think
they
are
puppets
of
god
or
cruel
fate
without
hope
or
remain
with
a
degrading
and
selfish
aim
in
view
both
here
and
after
various
names
have
been
given
to
these
beings
now
removed
from
our
plane
they
are
the
the
creators
the
guides
the
great
spirits
and
so
on
by
many
titles
in
theosophical
literature
they
are
called
the
by
methods
known
to
themselves
and
to
the
great
lodge
they
work
on
the
forms
so
brought
over
and
by
adding
here
taking
away
there
and
often
altering
they
gradually
transform
by
such
alteration
and
addition
the
kingdoms
of
nature
as
well
as
the
gradually
forming
gross
body
of
man
this
process
is
carried
on
chiefly
in
the
purely
astral
period
preceding
the
gross
physical
stage
as
the
impulses
thus
given
will
surely
carry
themselves
forward
through
the
succeeding
times
when
the
midway
point
of
evolution
is
reached
the
species
emerge
on
to
the
present
stage
and
not
showing
the
connection
to
the
eye
of
man
nor
to
our
instruments
the
investigations
of
the
day
have
traced
certain
species
down
to
a
point
where
as
is
confessed
it
is
not
known
to
what
root
they
go
back
taking
oxen
on
one
side
and
horses
on
the
other
we
see
that
both
are
hoofed
but
one
has
a
split
hoof
and
the
other
but
one
toe
these
bring
us
back
when
we
reach
the
oldest
ancestor
of
each
to
the
midway
point
and
there
science
has
to
stop
at
this
spot
the
wisdom
of
the
masters
comes
in
to
show
that
back
of
this
is
the
astral
region
of
ancient
evolution
where
were
the
in
which
the
dhyanis
began
the
evolution
by
alteration
and
addition
which
resulted
in
the
differentiation
afterwards
on
this
gross
plane
into
the
various
families
species
and
genera
a
vast
period
of
time
about
years
was
passed
by
earth
and
man
and
all
the
kingdoms
of
nature
in
an
astral
stage
then
there
was
no
gross
matter
such
as
we
now
know
this
was
in
the
early
rounds
when
nature
was
proceeding
slowly
with
the
work
of
perfecting
the
types
on
the
astral
plane
which
is
matter
though
very
fine
in
its
texture
at
the
end
of
that
stretch
of
years
the
process
of
hardening
began
the
form
of
man
being
the
first
to
become
solid
and
then
some
of
the
astral
prototypes
of
the
preceding
rounds
were
involved
in
the
solidification
though
really
belonging
to
a
former
period
when
everything
was
astral
when
those
fossils
are
discovered
it
is
argued
that
they
must
be
those
of
creatures
which
coëxisted
with
the
gross
physical
body
of
man
while
that
argument
is
proper
enough
under
the
other
theories
of
science
it
becomes
only
an
assumption
if
the
existence
of
the
astral
period
be
admitted
it
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
this
work
to
go
further
into
particulars
but
it
may
incidentally
be
said
that
neither
the
bee
nor
the
wheat
could
have
had
their
original
differentiation
in
this
chain
of
globes
but
must
have
been
produced
and
finished
in
some
other
from
which
they
were
brought
over
into
this
why
this
should
be
so
i
am
willing
to
leave
for
the
present
to
conjecture
to
the
whole
theory
it
may
be
objected
that
science
has
not
been
able
to
find
the
missing
links
between
the
of
the
astral
period
and
the
present
fossils
or
living
species
in
the
year
at
moscow
professor
virchow
said
in
a
lecture
that
the
missing
link
was
as
far
off
as
ever
as
much
of
a
dream
as
ever
and
that
no
real
evidence
was
at
hand
to
show
man
as
coming
from
the
animals
this
is
quite
true
and
neither
class
of
missing
link
will
be
discovered
by
science
under
her
present
methods
for
all
of
them
exist
in
the
astral
plane
and
therefore
are
invisible
to
the
physical
eye
they
can
only
be
seen
by
the
inner
astral
senses
which
must
first
be
trained
to
do
their
work
properly
and
until
science
admits
the
existence
of
the
astral
and
inner
senses
she
will
never
try
to
develop
them
always
then
science
will
be
without
the
instruments
for
discovering
the
astral
links
left
on
the
astral
plane
in
the
long
course
of
differentiation
the
fossils
spoken
of
above
which
were
so
to
say
solidified
out
of
date
form
an
exception
to
the
impossibility
of
finding
any
missing
links
but
they
are
blind
alleys
to
science
because
she
admits
none
of
the
necessary
facts
the
object
of
all
this
differentiation
amalgamation
and
separation
is
well
stated
by
another
of
the
masters
thus
nature
consciously
prefers
that
matter
should
be
indestructible
in
organic
rather
than
inorganic
forms
and
works
slowly
but
incessantly
towards
the
realization
of
this
evolution
of
conscious
life
out
of
inert
material
chapter
xvi
the
field
of
psychic
forces
phenomena
and
dynamics
is
a
vast
one
such
phenomena
are
seen
and
the
forces
exhibited
every
day
in
all
lands
but
until
a
few
years
ago
very
little
attention
was
given
to
them
by
scientific
persons
while
a
great
deal
of
ridicule
was
heaped
upon
those
who
related
the
occurrences
or
averred
belief
in
the
psychic
nature
a
cult
sprang
up
in
the
united
states
some
forty
years
ago
calling
itself
quite
wrongly
spiritualism
but
having
a
great
opportunity
it
neglected
it
and
fell
into
mere
without
the
slightest
shadow
of
a
philosophy
it
has
accomplished
but
little
in
the
way
of
progress
except
a
record
of
many
undigested
facts
which
for
four
decades
failed
to
attract
the
serious
attention
of
people
in
general
while
it
has
had
its
uses
and
includes
in
its
ranks
many
good
minds
the
great
dangers
and
damages
coming
to
the
human
instruments
involved
and
to
those
who
sought
them
more
than
offset
the
good
done
in
the
opinion
of
those
disciples
of
the
lodge
who
would
have
man
progress
evenly
and
without
ruin
along
his
path
of
evolution
but
other
western
investigators
of
the
accepted
schools
have
not
done
much
better
and
the
result
is
that
there
is
no
western
psychology
worthy
of
the
name
this
lack
of
an
adequate
system
of
psychology
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
materialistic
bias
of
science
and
the
paralyzing
influence
of
dogmatic
religion
the
one
ridiculing
effort
and
blocking
the
way
the
other
forbidding
investigation
the
roman
catholic
branch
of
the
christian
church
is
in
some
respects
an
exception
however
it
has
always
admitted
the
existence
of
the
psychic
it
is
the
realm
of
devils
and
angels
but
as
angels
manifest
when
they
choose
and
devils
are
to
be
shunned
no
one
is
permitted
by
that
church
to
meddle
in
such
matters
except
an
authorized
priest
so
far
as
that
church
s
prohibiting
the
pernicious
practice
of
necromancy
indulged
in
by
spiritualists
it
was
right
but
not
in
its
other
prohibitions
and
restrictions
real
psychology
is
an
oriental
product
very
true
the
system
was
known
in
the
west
when
a
very
ancient
civilization
flourished
in
america
and
in
certain
parts
of
europe
anterior
to
the
christian
era
but
for
the
present
day
psychology
in
its
true
phase
belongs
to
the
orient
are
there
psychic
forces
laws
and
powers
if
there
are
then
there
must
be
the
phenomena
and
if
all
that
has
been
outlined
in
preceding
chapters
is
true
then
in
man
are
the
same
powers
and
forces
which
are
to
be
found
anywhere
in
nature
he
is
held
by
the
masters
of
wisdom
to
be
the
highest
product
of
the
whole
system
of
evolution
and
mirrors
in
himself
every
power
however
wonderful
or
terrible
of
nature
by
the
very
fact
of
being
such
a
mirror
he
is
man
this
has
long
been
recognized
in
the
east
where
the
writer
has
seen
exhibitions
of
such
powers
which
would
upset
the
theories
of
many
a
western
man
of
science
and
in
the
west
the
same
phenomena
have
been
repeated
for
the
writer
so
that
he
knows
of
his
own
knowledge
that
every
man
of
every
race
has
the
same
powers
potentially
the
genuine
as
they
are
often
called
done
by
the
eastern
faquir
or
yogee
are
all
performed
by
the
use
of
natural
forces
and
processes
not
even
dreamed
of
as
yet
by
the
west
levitation
of
the
body
in
apparent
defiance
of
gravitation
is
a
thing
to
be
done
with
ease
when
the
process
is
completely
mastered
it
contravenes
no
law
gravitation
is
only
half
of
a
law
the
oriental
sage
admits
gravity
if
one
wishes
to
adopt
the
term
but
the
real
term
is
attraction
the
other
half
of
the
law
being
expressed
by
the
word
repulsion
and
both
being
governed
by
the
great
laws
of
electrical
force
weight
and
stability
depend
on
polarity
and
when
the
polarity
of
an
object
is
altered
in
respect
to
the
earth
immediately
underneath
it
then
the
object
may
rise
but
as
mere
objects
are
devoid
of
the
consciousness
found
in
man
they
can
not
rise
without
certain
other
aids
the
human
body
however
will
rise
in
the
air
unsupported
like
a
bird
when
its
polarity
is
thus
changed
this
change
is
brought
about
consciously
by
a
certain
system
of
breathing
known
to
the
oriental
it
may
be
induced
also
by
aid
from
certain
natural
forces
spoken
of
later
in
the
cases
of
those
who
without
knowing
the
law
perform
the
phenomena
as
with
the
saints
of
the
roman
catholic
church
a
third
great
law
which
enters
into
many
of
the
phenomena
of
the
east
and
west
is
that
of
cohesion
the
power
of
cohesion
is
a
distinct
power
of
itself
and
not
a
result
as
is
supposed
this
law
and
its
action
must
be
known
if
certain
phenomena
are
to
be
brought
about
as
for
instance
what
the
writer
has
seen
the
passing
of
one
solid
iron
ring
through
another
or
a
stone
through
a
solid
wall
hence
another
force
is
used
which
can
only
be
called
dispersion
cohesion
is
the
dominating
force
for
the
moment
the
dispersing
force
is
withdrawn
the
cohesive
force
restores
the
particles
to
their
original
position
following
this
out
the
adept
in
such
great
dynamics
is
able
to
disperse
the
atoms
of
an
always
the
human
such
a
distance
from
each
other
as
to
render
the
object
invisible
and
then
can
send
them
along
a
current
formed
in
the
ether
to
any
distance
on
the
earth
at
the
desired
point
the
dispersing
force
is
withdrawn
when
immediately
cohesion
reässerts
itself
and
the
object
reäppears
intact
this
may
sound
like
fiction
but
being
known
to
the
lodge
and
its
disciples
as
an
actual
fact
it
is
equally
certain
that
science
will
sooner
or
later
admit
the
proposition
but
the
lay
mind
infected
by
the
materialism
of
the
day
wonders
how
all
these
manipulations
are
possible
seeing
that
no
instruments
are
spoken
of
the
instruments
are
in
the
body
and
brain
of
man
in
the
view
of
the
lodge
the
human
brain
is
an
exhaustless
generator
of
force
and
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
inner
chemical
and
dynamic
laws
of
nature
together
with
a
trained
mind
give
the
possessor
the
power
to
operate
the
laws
to
which
i
have
referred
this
will
be
man
s
possession
in
the
future
and
would
be
his
were
it
not
for
blind
dogmatism
selfishness
and
materialistic
unbelief
not
even
the
christian
lives
up
to
his
master
s
very
true
statement
that
if
one
had
faith
he
could
remove
a
mountain
a
knowledge
of
the
law
when
added
to
faith
gives
power
over
matter
mind
space
and
time
using
the
same
powers
the
trained
adept
can
produce
before
the
eye
objective
to
the
touch
material
which
was
not
visible
before
and
in
any
desired
shape
this
would
be
called
creation
by
the
vulgar
but
it
is
simply
evolution
in
your
very
presence
matter
is
held
suspended
in
the
air
about
us
every
particle
of
matter
visible
or
still
unprecipitated
has
been
through
all
possible
forms
and
what
the
adept
does
is
to
select
any
desired
form
existing
as
they
all
do
in
the
astral
light
and
then
by
effort
of
the
will
and
imagination
to
clothe
the
form
with
the
matter
by
precipitation
the
object
so
made
will
fade
away
unless
certain
other
processes
are
resorted
to
which
need
not
be
here
described
but
if
these
processes
are
used
the
object
will
remain
permanently
and
if
it
is
desired
to
make
visible
a
message
on
paper
or
other
surface
the
same
laws
and
powers
are
used
the
and
sharply
of
every
line
of
every
letter
or
picture
is
formed
in
the
mind
and
then
out
of
the
air
is
drawn
the
pigment
to
fall
within
the
limits
laid
down
by
the
brain
the
exhaustless
generator
of
force
and
form
all
these
things
the
writer
has
seen
done
in
the
way
described
and
not
by
any
hired
or
irresponsible
medium
and
he
knows
whereof
he
speaks
this
then
naturally
leads
to
the
proposition
that
the
human
will
is
all
powerful
and
the
imagination
is
a
most
useful
faculty
with
a
dynamic
force
the
imagination
is
the
power
of
the
human
mind
in
the
ordinary
average
human
person
it
has
not
enough
training
or
force
to
be
more
than
a
sort
of
dream
but
it
may
be
trained
when
trained
it
is
the
constructor
in
the
human
workshop
arrived
at
that
stage
it
makes
a
matrix
in
the
astral
substance
through
which
effects
objectively
will
flow
it
is
the
greatest
power
after
will
in
the
human
assemblage
of
complicated
instruments
the
modern
western
definition
of
imagination
is
incomplete
and
wide
of
the
mark
it
is
chiefly
used
to
designate
fancy
or
misconception
and
at
all
times
stands
for
unreality
it
is
impossible
to
get
another
term
as
good
because
one
of
the
powers
of
the
trained
imagination
is
that
of
making
an
image
the
word
is
derived
from
those
signifying
the
formation
or
reflection
of
an
image
this
faculty
used
or
rather
suffered
to
act
in
an
unregulated
mode
has
given
the
west
no
other
idea
than
that
covered
by
fancy
so
far
as
that
goes
it
is
right
but
it
may
be
pushed
to
a
greater
limit
which
when
reached
causes
the
imagination
to
evolve
in
the
astral
substance
an
actual
image
or
form
which
may
be
then
used
in
the
same
way
as
an
iron
moulder
uses
a
mould
of
sand
for
the
molten
iron
it
is
therefore
the
king
faculty
inasmuch
as
the
will
can
not
do
its
work
if
the
imagination
be
at
all
weak
or
untrained
for
instance
if
the
person
desiring
to
precipitate
from
the
air
wavers
in
the
least
with
the
image
made
in
the
astral
substance
the
pigment
will
fall
upon
the
paper
in
a
correspondingly
wavering
and
diffused
manner
to
communicate
with
another
mind
at
any
distance
the
adept
attunes
all
the
molecules
of
the
brain
and
all
the
thoughts
of
the
mind
so
as
to
vibrate
in
unison
with
the
mind
to
be
affected
and
that
other
mind
and
brain
have
also
to
be
either
voluntarily
thrown
into
the
same
unison
or
fall
into
it
voluntarily
so
though
the
adept
be
at
bombay
and
his
friend
in
new
york
the
distance
is
no
obstacle
as
the
inner
senses
are
not
dependent
on
an
ear
but
may
feel
and
see
the
thoughts
and
images
in
the
mind
of
the
other
person
and
when
it
is
desired
to
look
into
the
mind
and
catch
the
thoughts
of
another
and
the
pictures
all
around
him
of
all
he
has
thought
and
looked
at
the
adept
s
inner
sight
and
hearing
are
directed
to
the
mind
to
be
seen
when
at
once
all
is
visible
but
as
said
before
only
a
rogue
would
do
this
and
the
adepts
do
not
do
it
except
in
strictly
authorized
cases
the
modern
man
sees
no
misdemeanor
in
looking
into
the
secrets
of
another
by
means
of
this
power
but
the
adepts
say
it
is
an
invasion
of
the
rights
of
the
other
person
no
man
has
the
right
even
when
he
has
the
power
in
his
hand
to
enter
into
the
mind
of
another
and
pick
out
its
secrets
this
is
the
law
of
the
lodge
to
all
who
seek
and
if
one
sees
that
he
is
about
to
discover
the
secrets
of
another
he
must
at
once
withdraw
and
proceed
no
further
if
he
proceeds
his
power
is
taken
from
him
in
the
case
of
a
disciple
in
the
case
of
any
other
person
he
must
take
the
consequence
of
this
sort
of
burglary
for
nature
has
her
laws
and
her
policemen
and
if
we
commit
felonies
in
the
astral
world
the
great
law
and
the
guardians
of
it
for
which
no
bribery
is
possible
will
execute
the
penalty
no
matter
how
long
we
wait
even
if
it
be
for
ten
thousand
years
here
is
another
safeguard
for
ethics
and
morals
but
until
men
admit
the
system
of
philosophy
put
forward
in
this
book
they
will
not
deem
it
wrong
to
commit
felonies
in
fields
where
their
weak
human
law
has
no
effect
but
at
the
same
time
by
thus
refusing
the
philosophy
they
will
put
off
the
day
when
all
may
have
these
great
powers
for
the
use
of
all
among
phenomena
useful
to
notice
are
those
consisting
of
the
moving
of
objects
without
physical
contact
this
may
be
done
and
in
more
than
one
way
the
first
is
to
extrude
from
the
physical
body
the
astral
hand
and
arm
and
with
those
grasp
the
object
to
be
moved
this
may
be
accomplished
at
a
distance
of
as
much
as
ten
feet
from
the
person
i
do
not
go
into
argument
on
this
only
referring
to
the
properties
of
the
astral
substance
and
members
this
will
serve
to
some
extent
to
explain
several
of
the
phenomena
of
mediums
in
nearly
all
cases
of
such
apportation
the
feat
is
accomplished
by
thus
using
the
unseen
but
material
astral
hand
the
second
method
is
to
use
the
elementals
of
which
i
have
spoken
they
have
the
power
when
directed
by
the
inner
man
to
carry
objects
by
changing
the
polarity
and
then
we
see
as
with
the
fakirs
of
india
and
some
mediums
in
america
small
objects
moving
apparently
unsupported
these
elemental
entities
are
used
when
things
are
brought
from
longer
distances
than
the
length
to
which
the
astral
members
may
be
stretched
it
is
no
argument
against
this
that
mediums
do
not
know
they
do
so
they
rarely
if
ever
know
anything
about
how
they
accomplish
any
feat
and
their
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
proof
of
its
those
students
who
have
seen
the
forces
work
from
the
inside
will
need
no
argument
on
this
clairvoyance
clairaudience
and
are
all
related
very
closely
every
exercise
of
any
one
of
them
draws
in
at
the
same
time
both
of
the
others
they
are
but
variations
of
one
power
sound
is
one
of
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
the
astral
sphere
and
as
light
goes
with
sound
sight
obtains
simultaneously
with
hearing
to
see
an
image
with
the
astral
senses
means
that
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
sound
and
to
hear
the
latter
infers
the
presence
of
a
related
image
in
astral
substance
it
is
perfectly
well
known
to
the
true
student
of
occultism
that
every
sound
produces
instantaneously
an
image
and
this
so
long
known
in
the
orient
has
lately
been
demonstrated
in
the
west
in
the
production
to
the
eye
of
sound
pictures
on
a
stretched
tympanum
this
part
of
the
subject
can
be
gone
into
very
much
further
with
the
aid
of
occultism
but
as
it
is
a
dangerous
one
in
the
present
state
of
society
i
refrain
at
this
point
in
the
astral
light
are
pictures
of
all
things
whatsoever
that
happened
to
any
person
and
as
well
also
pictures
of
those
events
to
come
the
causes
for
which
are
sufficiently
well
marked
and
made
if
the
causes
are
yet
indefinite
so
will
be
the
images
of
the
future
but
for
the
mass
of
events
for
several
years
to
come
all
the
producing
and
efficient
causes
are
always
laid
down
with
enough
definiteness
to
permit
the
seer
to
see
them
in
advance
as
if
present
by
means
of
these
pictures
seen
with
the
inner
senses
all
clairvoyants
exercise
their
strange
faculty
yet
it
is
a
faculty
common
to
all
men
though
in
the
majority
but
slightly
developed
but
occultism
asserts
that
were
it
not
for
the
germ
of
this
power
slightly
active
in
every
one
no
man
could
convey
to
another
any
idea
whatsoever
in
clairvoyance
the
pictures
in
the
astral
light
pass
before
the
inner
vision
and
are
reflected
into
the
physical
eye
from
within
they
then
appear
objectively
to
the
seer
if
they
are
of
past
events
or
those
to
come
the
picture
only
is
seen
if
of
events
actually
then
occurring
the
scene
is
perceived
through
the
astral
light
by
the
inner
sense
the
distinguishing
difference
between
ordinary
and
clairvoyant
vision
is
then
that
in
clairvoyance
with
waking
sight
the
vibration
is
communicated
to
the
brain
first
from
which
it
is
transmitted
to
the
physical
eye
where
it
sets
up
an
image
upon
the
retina
just
as
the
revolving
cylinder
of
the
phonograph
causes
the
mouthpiece
to
vibrate
exactly
as
the
voice
had
vibrated
when
thrown
into
the
receiver
in
ordinary
eye
vision
the
vibrations
are
given
to
the
eye
first
and
then
transmitted
to
the
brain
images
and
sounds
are
both
caused
by
vibrations
and
hence
any
sound
once
made
is
preserved
in
the
astral
light
from
whence
the
inner
sense
can
take
it
and
from
within
transmit
it
to
the
brain
from
which
it
reaches
the
physical
ear
so
in
clairaudience
at
a
distance
the
hearer
does
not
hear
with
the
ear
but
with
the
centre
of
hearing
in
the
astral
body
is
a
combination
of
clairaudience
and
clairvoyance
or
not
just
as
the
particular
case
is
and
the
frequency
with
which
future
events
are
seen
by
the
seer
adds
an
element
of
prophecy
the
highest
order
of
of
spiritual
very
rare
the
usual
clairvoyant
deals
only
with
the
ordinary
aspects
and
strata
of
the
astral
matter
spiritual
sight
comes
only
to
those
who
are
pure
devoted
and
firm
it
may
be
attained
by
special
development
of
the
particular
organ
in
the
body
through
which
alone
such
sight
is
possible
and
only
after
discipline
long
training
and
the
highest
altruism
all
other
clairvoyance
is
transitory
inadequate
and
fragmentary
dealing
as
it
does
only
with
matter
and
illusion
its
fragmentary
and
inadequate
character
results
from
the
fact
that
hardly
any
clairvoyant
has
the
power
to
see
into
more
than
one
of
the
lower
grades
of
astral
substance
at
any
one
time
the
and
the
brave
can
deal
with
the
future
and
the
present
far
better
than
any
clairvoyant
but
as
the
existence
of
these
two
powers
proves
the
presence
in
us
of
the
inner
senses
and
of
the
necessary
astral
light
they
have
as
such
human
faculties
an
important
bearing
upon
the
claims
made
by
the
spirits
of
the
room
dreams
are
sometimes
the
result
of
brain
action
automatically
proceeding
and
are
also
produced
by
the
transmission
into
the
brain
by
the
real
inner
person
of
those
scenes
or
ideas
high
or
low
which
that
real
person
has
seen
while
the
body
slept
they
are
then
strained
into
the
brain
as
if
floating
on
the
soul
as
it
sinks
into
the
body
these
dreams
may
be
of
use
but
generally
the
resumption
of
bodily
activity
destroys
the
meaning
perverts
the
image
and
reduces
all
to
confusion
but
the
great
fact
of
all
dreaming
is
that
some
one
perceives
and
feels
therein
and
this
is
one
of
the
arguments
for
the
inner
person
s
existence
in
sleep
the
inner
man
communes
with
higher
intelligences
and
sometimes
succeeds
in
impressing
the
brain
with
what
is
gained
either
a
high
idea
or
a
prophetic
vision
or
else
fails
in
consequence
of
the
resistance
of
brain
fibre
the
karma
of
the
person
also
determines
the
meaning
of
a
dream
for
a
king
may
dream
that
which
relates
to
his
kingdom
while
the
same
thing
dreamed
by
a
citizen
relates
to
nothing
of
temporal
consequence
but
as
said
by
job
in
dreams
and
visions
of
the
night
man
is
apparitions
and
doubles
are
of
two
general
classes
the
one
astral
shells
or
images
from
the
astral
world
either
actually
visible
to
the
eye
or
the
result
of
vibration
within
thrown
out
to
the
eye
and
thus
making
the
person
think
he
sees
an
objective
form
without
the
other
the
astral
body
of
living
persons
and
carrying
full
consciousness
or
only
partially
so
endowed
laborious
attempts
by
psychical
research
societies
to
prove
apparitions
without
knowing
these
laws
really
prove
nothing
for
out
of
twenty
admitted
cases
nineteen
may
be
the
objectivization
of
the
image
impressed
on
the
brain
but
that
apparitions
have
been
seen
there
is
no
doubt
apparitions
of
those
just
dead
may
be
either
pictures
made
objective
as
described
or
the
astral
at
this
the
deceased
and
as
the
dying
thoughts
and
forces
released
from
the
body
are
very
strong
we
have
more
accounts
of
such
apparitions
than
of
any
other
class
the
adept
may
send
out
his
apparition
which
however
is
called
by
another
name
as
it
consists
of
his
conscious
and
trained
astral
body
endowed
with
all
his
intelligence
and
not
wholly
detached
from
his
physical
frame
theosophy
does
not
deny
nor
ignore
the
physical
laws
discovered
by
science
it
admits
all
such
as
are
proven
but
it
asserts
the
existence
of
others
which
modify
the
action
of
those
we
ordinarily
know
behind
all
the
visible
phenomena
is
the
occult
cosmos
with
its
ideal
machinery
that
occult
cosmos
can
only
be
fully
understood
by
means
of
the
inner
senses
which
pertain
to
it
those
senses
will
not
be
easily
developed
if
their
existence
is
denied
brain
and
mind
acting
together
have
the
power
to
evolve
forms
first
as
astral
ones
in
astral
substance
and
later
as
visible
ones
by
accretions
of
the
matter
on
this
plane
objectivity
depends
largely
on
perception
and
perception
may
be
affected
by
inner
stimuli
hence
a
witness
may
either
see
an
object
which
actually
exists
as
such
without
or
may
be
made
to
see
one
by
internal
stimulus
this
gives
us
three
modes
of
sight
with
the
eye
by
means
of
light
from
an
object
with
the
inner
senses
by
means
of
the
astral
light
and
by
stimulus
from
within
which
causes
the
eye
to
report
to
the
brain
thus
throwing
the
inner
image
without
the
phenomena
of
the
other
senses
may
be
tabulated
in
the
same
manner
the
astral
substance
being
the
register
of
all
thoughts
sounds
pictures
and
other
vibrations
and
the
inner
man
being
a
complete
person
able
to
act
with
or
without
coördination
with
the
physical
all
the
phenomena
of
hypnotism
clairvoyance
clairaudience
mediumship
and
the
rest
of
those
which
are
not
consciously
performed
may
be
explained
in
the
astral
substance
are
all
sounds
and
pictures
and
in
the
astral
man
remain
impressions
of
every
event
however
remote
or
insignificant
these
acting
together
produce
the
phenomena
which
seem
so
strange
to
those
who
deny
or
are
unaware
of
the
postulates
of
occultism
but
to
explain
the
phenomena
performed
by
adepts
fakirs
yogees
and
all
trained
occultists
one
has
to
understand
the
occult
laws
of
chemistry
of
mind
of
force
and
of
matter
these
it
is
obviously
not
the
province
of
such
a
work
as
this
to
treat
in
detail
chapter
xvii
in
the
history
of
psychical
phenomena
the
records
of
spiritualism
in
europe
america
and
elsewhere
hold
an
important
place
advisedly
i
say
that
no
term
was
ever
more
misapplied
than
that
of
spiritualism
to
the
cult
in
europe
and
america
just
mentioned
inasmuch
as
there
is
nothing
of
the
spirit
about
it
the
doctrines
given
in
preceding
chapters
are
those
of
true
spiritualism
the
misnamed
practices
of
modern
mediums
and
spiritists
constitute
the
worship
of
the
dead
necromancy
in
fact
which
was
always
prohibited
by
spiritual
teachers
they
are
a
gross
materializing
of
the
spiritual
idea
and
deal
with
matter
more
than
with
its
opposite
this
cult
is
supposed
by
some
to
have
originated
about
forty
years
ago
in
america
at
rochester
under
the
mediumship
of
the
fox
sisters
but
it
was
known
in
salem
during
the
witchcraft
excitement
and
in
europe
one
hundred
years
ago
the
same
practices
were
pursued
similar
phenomena
seen
mediums
developed
and
held
for
centuries
it
has
been
well
known
in
india
where
it
is
properly
designated
worship
meaning
the
attempt
to
communicate
with
the
devil
or
astral
remnants
of
deceased
persons
this
should
be
its
name
here
also
for
by
it
the
gross
and
devilish
or
earthly
parts
of
man
are
excited
appealed
to
and
communicated
with
but
the
facts
of
the
long
record
of
forty
years
in
america
demand
a
brief
examination
these
facts
all
studious
theosophists
must
admit
the
theosophical
explanation
and
deductions
however
are
totally
different
from
those
of
the
average
spiritualist
a
philosophy
has
not
been
evolved
in
the
ranks
or
literature
of
spiritualism
nothing
but
theosophy
will
give
the
true
explanation
point
out
defects
reveal
dangers
and
suggest
remedies
as
it
is
plain
that
clairvoyance
clairaudience
prophecy
dream
and
vision
levitation
apparitional
appearance
are
all
powers
that
have
been
known
for
ages
the
questions
most
pressing
in
respect
to
spiritualism
are
those
relating
to
communication
with
the
souls
of
those
who
have
left
this
earth
and
are
now
disembodied
and
with
unclassified
spirits
who
have
not
been
embodied
here
but
belong
to
other
spheres
perhaps
also
the
question
of
materialization
of
forms
at
deserves
some
attention
communication
includes
slate
and
other
writing
independent
voices
in
the
air
speaking
through
the
physical
vocal
organs
of
the
medium
and
precipitation
of
written
messages
out
of
the
air
do
the
mediums
communicate
with
the
spirits
of
the
dead
do
our
departed
friends
perceive
the
state
of
life
they
have
left
and
do
they
sometimes
return
to
speak
to
and
with
us
the
answers
are
intimated
in
foregoing
chapters
our
departed
do
not
see
us
here
they
are
relieved
from
the
terrible
pang
such
a
sight
would
inflict
once
in
a
while
a
unpaid
medium
may
ascend
in
trance
to
the
state
in
which
a
deceased
soul
is
and
may
remember
some
bits
of
what
was
there
heard
but
this
is
rare
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
decades
some
high
human
spirit
may
for
a
moment
return
and
by
unmistakable
means
communicate
with
mortals
at
the
moment
of
death
the
soul
may
speak
to
some
friend
on
earth
before
the
door
is
finally
shut
but
the
mass
of
communications
alleged
as
made
day
after
day
through
mediums
are
from
the
astral
unintelligent
remains
of
men
or
in
many
cases
entirely
the
production
of
invention
compilation
discovery
and
collocation
by
the
loosely
attached
astral
body
of
the
living
medium
certain
objections
arise
to
the
theory
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
communicate
some
are
i
at
no
time
have
these
spirits
given
the
laws
governing
any
of
the
phenomena
except
in
a
few
instances
not
accepted
by
the
cult
where
the
theosophical
theory
was
advanced
as
it
would
destroy
such
structures
as
those
erected
by
davis
these
particular
spirits
fell
into
discredit
ii
the
spirits
disagree
among
themselves
one
stating
the
to
be
very
different
from
the
description
by
another
these
disagreements
vary
with
the
medium
and
the
supposed
theories
of
the
deceased
during
life
one
spirit
admits
reïncarnation
and
others
deny
it
iii
the
spirits
have
discovered
nothing
in
respect
to
history
anthropology
or
other
important
matters
seeming
to
have
less
ability
in
that
line
than
living
men
and
although
they
often
claim
to
be
men
who
lived
in
older
civilizations
they
show
ignorance
thereupon
or
merely
repeat
recently
published
discoveries
iv
in
these
forty
years
no
of
phenomena
nor
of
development
of
mediumship
has
been
obtained
from
the
spirits
great
philosophers
are
reported
as
speaking
through
mediums
but
utter
only
drivel
and
merest
commonplaces
the
mediums
come
to
physical
and
moral
grief
are
accused
of
fraud
are
shown
guilty
of
trickery
but
the
spirit
guides
and
controls
do
not
interfere
to
either
prevent
or
save
vi
it
is
admitted
that
the
guides
and
controls
deceive
and
incite
to
fraud
vii
it
is
plainly
to
be
seen
through
all
that
is
reported
of
the
spirits
that
their
assertions
and
philosophy
if
any
vary
with
the
medium
and
the
most
advanced
thought
of
living
spiritualists
from
all
this
and
much
more
that
could
be
adduced
the
man
of
materialistic
science
is
fortified
in
his
ridicule
but
the
theosophist
has
to
conclude
that
the
entities
if
there
be
any
communicating
are
not
human
spirits
and
that
the
explanations
are
to
be
found
in
some
other
theories
materialization
of
a
form
out
of
the
air
independent
of
the
medium
s
physical
body
is
a
fact
but
it
is
not
a
spirit
as
was
very
well
said
by
one
of
the
spirits
not
favored
by
spiritualism
one
way
to
produce
this
phenomenon
is
by
the
accretion
of
electrical
and
magnetic
particles
into
one
mass
upon
which
matter
is
aggregated
and
an
image
reflected
out
of
the
astral
sphere
this
is
the
whole
of
it
as
much
a
fraud
as
a
collection
of
muslin
and
masks
how
this
is
accomplished
is
another
matter
the
spirits
are
not
able
to
tell
but
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
indicate
the
methods
and
instruments
in
former
chapters
the
second
method
is
by
the
use
of
the
astral
body
of
the
living
medium
in
this
case
the
astral
form
exudes
from
the
side
of
the
medium
gradually
collects
upon
itself
particles
extracted
from
the
air
and
the
bodies
of
the
sitters
present
until
at
last
it
becomes
visible
sometimes
it
will
resemble
the
medium
at
others
it
bears
a
different
appearance
in
almost
every
instance
dimness
of
light
is
requisite
because
a
high
light
would
disturb
the
astral
substance
in
a
violent
manner
and
render
the
projection
difficult
some
materializations
are
hollow
mockeries
as
they
are
but
flat
plates
of
electrical
and
magnetic
substance
on
which
pictures
from
the
astral
light
are
reflected
these
seem
to
be
the
faces
of
the
dead
but
they
are
simply
pictured
illusions
if
one
is
to
understand
the
psychic
phenomena
found
in
the
history
of
spiritualism
it
is
necessary
to
know
and
admit
the
following
i
the
complete
heredity
of
man
astrally
spiritually
and
psychically
as
a
being
who
knows
reasons
feels
and
acts
through
the
body
the
astral
body
and
the
soul
ii
the
nature
of
the
mind
its
operation
its
powers
the
nature
and
power
of
imagination
the
duration
and
effect
of
impressions
most
important
in
this
is
the
persistence
of
the
slightest
impression
as
well
as
the
deepest
that
every
impression
produces
a
picture
in
the
individual
aura
and
that
by
means
of
this
a
connection
is
established
between
the
auras
of
friends
and
relatives
old
new
near
distant
and
remote
in
degree
this
would
give
a
wide
range
of
possible
sight
to
a
clairvoyant
iii
the
nature
extent
function
and
power
of
man
s
inner
astral
organs
and
faculties
included
in
the
terms
astral
body
and
that
these
are
not
hindered
from
action
by
trance
or
sleep
but
are
increased
in
the
medium
when
entranced
at
the
same
time
their
action
is
not
free
but
governed
by
the
mass
chord
of
thought
among
the
sitters
or
by
a
predominating
will
or
by
the
presiding
devil
behind
the
scenes
if
a
sceptical
scientific
investigator
be
present
his
mental
attitude
may
totally
inhibit
the
action
of
the
medium
s
powers
by
what
we
might
call
a
freezing
process
which
no
english
terms
will
adequately
describe
iv
the
fate
of
the
real

if
any

here
that
the
intermediary
between
mind
and
astral
thrown
off
at
death
and
left
in
the
astral
light
to
fade
away
and
that
the
real
man
goes
to
vi
the
existence
nature
power
and
function
of
the
astral
light
and
its
place
as
a
register
in
nature
that
it
contains
retains
and
reflects
pictures
of
each
and
every
thing
that
happened
to
anyone
and
also
every
thought
that
it
permeates
the
globe
and
the
atmosphere
around
it
that
the
transmission
of
vibration
through
it
is
practically
instantaneous
since
the
rate
is
much
quicker
than
that
of
electricity
as
now
known
vii
the
existence
in
the
astral
light
of
beings
not
using
bodies
like
ours
but
not
human
in
their
nature
having
powers
faculties
and
a
sort
of
consciousness
of
their
own
these
include
the
elemental
forces
or
nature
sprites
divided
into
many
degrees
and
which
have
to
do
with
every
operation
of
nature
and
every
motion
of
the
mind
of
man
that
these
elementals
act
at
automatically
in
their
various
departments
one
class
presenting
pictures
another
producing
sounds
and
others
depolarizing
objects
for
the
purposes
of
apportation
acting
with
them
in
this
astral
sphere
are
the
soulless
men
who
live
in
it
to
these
are
to
be
ascribed
the
phenomenon
among
others
of
the
independent
voice
always
sounding
like
a
voice
in
a
barrel
just
because
it
is
made
in
a
vacuum
which
is
absolutely
necessary
for
an
entity
so
far
removed
from
spirit
the
peculiar
of
this
sort
of
voice
has
not
been
noticed
by
the
spiritualists
as
important
but
it
is
extremely
significant
in
the
view
of
occultism
viii
the
existence
and
operation
of
occult
laws
and
forces
in
nature
which
may
be
used
to
produce
phenomenal
results
on
this
plane
that
these
laws
and
forces
may
be
put
into
operation
by
the
subconscious
man
and
by
the
elementals
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
that
many
of
these
occult
operations
are
automatic
in
the
same
way
as
is
the
freezing
of
water
under
intense
cold
or
the
melting
of
ice
under
heat
ix
that
the
astral
body
of
the
medium
partaking
of
the
nature
of
the
astral
substance
may
be
extended
from
the
physical
body
may
act
outside
of
the
latter
and
may
also
extrude
at
times
any
portion
of
itself
such
as
hand
arm
or
leg
and
thereby
move
objects
indite
letters
produce
touches
on
the
body
and
so
on
and
that
the
astral
body
of
any
person
may
be
made
to
feel
sensation
which
being
transmitted
to
the
brain
causes
the
person
to
think
he
is
touched
on
the
outside
or
has
heard
a
sound
mediumship
is
full
of
dangers
because
the
astral
part
of
the
man
is
now
only
normal
in
action
when
joined
to
the
body
in
distant
years
it
will
normally
act
without
a
body
as
it
has
in
the
far
past
to
become
a
medium
means
that
you
have
to
become
disorganized
physiologically
and
in
the
nervous
system
because
through
the
latter
is
the
connection
between
the
two
worlds
the
moment
the
door
is
opened
all
the
unknown
forces
rush
in
and
as
the
grosser
part
of
nature
is
nearest
to
us
it
is
that
part
which
affects
us
most
the
lower
nature
is
also
first
affected
and
inflamed
because
the
forces
used
are
from
that
part
of
us
we
are
then
at
the
mercy
of
the
vile
thoughts
of
all
men
and
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
shells
in
if
to
this
be
added
the
taking
of
money
for
the
practice
of
mediumship
an
additional
danger
is
at
hand
for
the
things
of
the
spirit
and
those
relating
to
the
astral
world
must
not
be
sold
this
is
the
great
disease
of
american
spiritualism
which
has
debased
and
degraded
its
whole
history
until
it
is
eliminated
no
good
will
come
from
the
practice
those
who
wish
to
hear
truth
from
the
other
world
must
devote
themselves
to
truth
and
leave
all
considerations
of
money
out
of
sight
to
attempt
to
acquire
the
use
of
the
psychic
powers
for
mere
curiosity
or
for
selfish
ends
is
also
dangerous
for
the
same
reasons
as
in
the
case
of
mediumship
as
the
civilization
of
the
present
day
is
selfish
to
the
last
degree
and
built
on
the
personal
element
the
rules
for
the
development
of
these
powers
in
the
right
way
have
not
been
given
out
but
the
masters
of
wisdom
have
said
that
philosophy
and
ethics
must
first
be
learned
and
practised
before
any
development
of
the
other
department
is
to
be
indulged
in
and
their
condemnation
of
the
wholesale
development
of
mediums
is
supported
by
the
history
of
spiritualism
which
is
one
long
story
of
the
ruin
of
mediums
in
every
direction
equally
improper
is
the
manner
of
the
scientific
schools
which
without
a
thought
for
the
true
nature
of
man
indulge
in
experiments
in
hypnotism
in
which
the
subjects
are
injured
for
life
put
into
disgraceful
attitudes
and
made
to
do
things
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
investigators
which
would
never
be
done
by
men
and
women
in
their
normal
state
the
lodge
of
the
masters
does
not
care
for
science
unless
it
aims
to
better
man
s
state
morally
as
well
as
physically
and
no
aid
will
be
given
to
science
until
she
looks
at
man
and
life
from
the
moral
and
spiritual
side
for
this
reason
those
who
know
all
about
the
psychical
world
its
denizens
and
laws
are
proceeding
with
a
reform
in
morals
and
philosophy
before
any
great
attention
will
be
accorded
to
the
strange
and
seductive
phenomena
possible
for
the
inner
powers
of
man
and
at
the
present
time
the
cycle
has
almost
run
its
course
for
this
century
now
as
a
century
ago
the
forces
are
slackening
for
that
reason
the
phenomena
of
spiritualism
are
lessening
in
number
and
volume
the
lodge
hopes
by
the
time
the
next
tide
begins
to
rise
that
the
west
will
have
gained
some
right
knowledge
of
the
true
philosophy
of
man
and
nature
and
be
then
ready
to
bear
the
lifting
of
the
veil
a
little
more
to
help
on
the
progress
of
the
race
in
this
direction
is
the
object
of
this
book
and
with
that
it
is
submitted
to
its
readers
in
every
part
of
the
world
the
united
lodge
of
theosophists
declaration
the
policy
of
this
lodge
is
independent
devotion
to
the
cause
of
theosophy
without
professing
attachment
to
any
theosophical
organization
it
is
loyal
to
the
great
founders
of
the
theosophical
movement
but
does
not
concern
itself
with
dissensions
or
differences
of
individual
opinion
the
work
it
has
on
hand
and
the
end
it
keeps
in
view
are
too
absorbing
and
too
lofty
to
leave
it
the
time
or
inclination
to
take
part
in
side
issues
that
work
and
that
end
is
the
dissemination
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
philosophy
of
theosophy
and
the
exemplification
in
practice
of
those
principles
through
a
truer
realization
of
the
self
a
profounder
conviction
of
universal
brotherhood
it
holds
that
the
unassailable
for
among
theosophists
wherever
and
however
situated
is
of
aim
purpose
and
and
therefore
has
neither
constitution
nor
officers
the
sole
bond
between
its
associates
being
that
and
it
aims
to
disseminate
this
idea
among
theosophists
in
the
furtherance
of
unity
it
regards
as
theosophists
all
who
are
engaged
in
the
true
service
of
humanity
without
distinction
of
race
creed
sex
condition
or
organization
and
it
welcomes
to
its
association
all
those
who
are
in
accord
with
its
declared
purposes
and
who
desire
to
fit
themselves
by
study
and
otherwise
to
be
the
better
able
to
help
and
teach
others
true

belongs
to

with
the
purposes
of
this
