chapter
one
they
also

oh
kitty
look
little
billy
carter
jumped
up
and
down
in
delight
beside
his
tall
sister
there
s
daddy
where
kitty
asked
as
she
searched
the
files
of
marching
troops
for
a
look
at
her
dad
billy
pointed
with
his
chubby
finger
yonder
the
straightest
bestest
of
all
then
kitty
s
heart
swelled
with
pride
too
as
she
watched
a
tall
man
with
the
other
medical
officers
from
the
naval
hospital
they
were
all
wonderful
those
rhythmical
moving
lines
of
blue
green
and
khaki
but
for
the
two
carters
the
heart
and
soul
of
it
all
was
the
chief
pharmacist
s
mate
they
called
dad
they
were
sure
the
war
could
never
be
won
without
him
it
was
a
gala
day
in
bayport
for
every
organization
had
turned
out
to
boost
the
community
chest
drive
now
a
military
band
was
passing
while
billy
s
small
feet
kept
time
and
scuffed
out
the
soles
of
his
shoes
kitty
had
had
no
idea
a
could
wear
out
so
many
shoes
till
she
had
come
home
from
college
a
short
time
ago
was
it
really
only
a
few
weeks
ago
to
kitty
it
seemed
ages
for
her
whole
program
of
life
had
been
changed
in
that
time
there
come
the
wacs
to
give
hitler
whacks
billy
prattled
and
there
are
the
waves
our
american
kitty
laughed
though
her
heart
was
like
stone
as
she
repeated
the
silly
rhyme
she
had
made
up
for
billy
at
christmastime
when
she
told
him
she
was
going
to
join
the
waves
how
little
she
had
dreamed
during
that
happy
vacation
that
aunt
nina
would
be
gone
in
another
month
and
billy
would
have
no
one
to
look
to
except
his
big
sister
but
kitty
couldn
t
keep
back
the
blinding
tears
as
the
wacs
and
waves
passed
in
their
trim
uniforms
their
heads
held
high
their
eyes
bright
in
the
knowledge
that
they
were
doing
their
share
to
help
win
the
war
when
are
you
going
to
be
a
wave
kit
and
wear
a
pretty
uniform
billy
wanted
to
know
i
ve
decided
not
to
be
a
wave
darling
kitty
looked
straight
ahead
for
fear
he
would
see
her
tears
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
help
win
the
war
dad
says
we
all
look
there
come
the
tanks
billy
forgot
his
puzzlement
over
his
sister
s
change
of
plans
for
the
tanks
were
followed
by
jeeps
trucks
and
more
lines
of
marching
men
and
women
at
last
the
parade
went
on
down
bay
street
but
kitty
still
stood
staring
at
the
moving
stream
of
passenger
cars
in
its
wake
though
she
really
saw
nothing
that
passed
somehow
she
felt
cheated
out
of
it
all
after
a
while
an
insistent
small
hand
tugging
at
hers
brought
her
back
to
the
present
aren
t
we
going
to
see
the
ducks
in
the
park
you
yes
of
course
it
ll
be
fun
watching
the
ducks
let
s
go
across
to
the
bay
they
succeeded
in
crossing
the
street
finally
and
hurried
down
the
path
curving
around
the
bay
shore
in
sight
of
the
water
kitty
s
spirits
always
lifted
after
all
it
was
for
such
as
billy
that
this
war
was
being
fought
that
they
might
be
free
to
go
to
parks
and
feed
ducks
and
walk
along
a
bay
shore
without
fear
of
bombs
overhead
as
dad
had
said
she
was
really
doing
more
than
her
bit
giving
him
a
start
in
life
bayshore
park
was
a
lovely
spot
of
green
under
magnificent
live
oaks
by
the
time
they
reached
it
the
parade
had
broken
up
and
marines
soldiers
and
sailors
were
scattered
about
the
green
slopes
resting
after
their
long
march
at
the
duck
pond
kitty
took
a
small
package
of
bread
crumbs
for
the
ducks
from
her
purse
and
handed
them
to
billy
as
she
sat
on
a
bench
near
by
her
attention
was
suddenly
caught
by
a
group
of
canteen
workers
serving
a
lunch
to
the
tired
soldiers
there
were
young
girls
in
the
corps
some
even
younger
than
she
laughing
and
talking
with
the
men
as
they
served
them
coffee
doughnuts
and
sandwiches
from
a
long
table
under
the
trees
how
hungry
the
boys
seemed
and
how
appreciative
of
having
some
girls
to
talk
to
now
she
recognized
one
of
the
girls
from
near
her
home
over
on
palmetto
island
why
sally
bright
was
still
in
high
school
how
could
she
get
into
the
canteen
corps
look
kitty
the
sailor
made
me
a
boat
again
billy
s
voice
recalled
her
from
her
abstraction
she
discovered
a
young
yeoman
squatting
by
the
pond
with
billy
as
they
launched
a
boat
with
an
sail
billy
was
gobbling
half
a
sandwich
the
sailor
had
given
him
you
shouldn
t
have
given
him
your
sandwich
she
exclaimed
the
young
man
sprang
to
his
feet
apparently
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
they
re
so
good
he
explained
i
couldn
t
eat
with
him
looking
he
had
brown
eyes
that
twinkled
as
he
spoke
they
do
look
good
she
admitted
let
me
get
you
one
these
canteen
girls
sure
have
a
genius
for
making
oh
no
don
t
bother
please
i
m
not
i
ve
a
kid
sister
who
s
learned
lots
about
good
food
since
she
s
been
a
canteen
kid
sister
repeated
kitty
puzzled
he
laughed
well
she
s
not
such
a
kid
after
all
i
guess
junior
in
how
can
she
be
a
canteen
worker
and
go
to
college
too
oh
she
has
plenty
of
extra
time
to
get
in
her
canteen
quota
of
hours
a
girl
can
do
canteen
work
anywhere
she
happens
to
be
oh
i
didn
t
know
that
you
mean
they
don
t
have
to
sign
up
for
full
time
or
go
away
from
home
to
do
that
work
sure
oh
say
why
didn
t
i
know
about
this
before
the
sailor
s
face
grew
serious
at
the
desperate
way
in
which
she
spoke
why
would
you
like
to
do
canteen
work
i
d
like
to
do
anything
to
well
gal
nobody
s
keeping
you
from
it
there
s
miss
pearson
right
over
yonder
i
ll
introduce
you
to
her
heard
her
say
she
s
going
to
start
a
new
nutrition
class
next
he
caught
her
hand
and
started
across
the
green
to
the
end
of
the
long
table
where
an
woman
in
a
blue
uniform
with
spotless
white
collar
and
cuffs
was
pouring
coffee
within
a
few
feet
of
her
the
sailor
stopped
suddenly
what
your
name
after
all
introductions
are
awkward
without
having
the
names
of
both
they
laughed
kathryn
they
call
me
of
i
m
yeoman
brad
i
knew
you
were
a
crossed
feather
insignia
she
told
him
you
see
my
dad
s
been
in
the
navy
ten
his
face
brightened
oh
then
we
re
practically
in
the
same
family
and
now
that
the
formalities
are
over
we
ll
proceed
to
kitty
glanced
toward
the
end
of
the
table
and
realized
that
miss
pearson
had
overheard
their
little
conversation
the
three
of
them
laughed
and
the
ice
was
completely
broken
since
introductions
are
now
unnecessary
miss
pearson
said
brad
let
me
explain
that
this
young
lady
has
suddenly
discovered
there
s
such
a
thing
in
this
man
s
war
as
a
canteen
kitty
flushed
oh
really
now
i
ve
always
known
about
them
but
just
got
the
idea
of
doing
that
work
it
s
certainly
the
duty
of
everyone
to
serve
kitty
felt
a
slight
edge
on
miss
pearson
s
tone
and
was
aware
that
her
eyes
swept
over
her
smart
sweater
suit
and
the
jaunty
blue
tam
i
ve
always
meant
to
do
my
bit
the
minute
i
got
my
degree
kitty
hastened
to
explain
but
i
ve
thought
and
dreamed
and
worked
toward
going
into
the
well
why
don
t
you
they
re
doing
a
marvelous
kitty
s
eyes
wandered
to
where
billy
poked
at
his
sail
boat
with
a
long
stick
i
can
t
go
now
she
said
in
a
low
tone
my
aunt
who
has
taken
care
of
my
little
brother
since
my
mother
died
also
left
us
six
weeks
ago
dad
s
in
the
service
and
there
s
no
one
left
with
billy
but
miss
pearson
followed
kitty
s
glance
to
the
little
form
beside
the
pond
her
voice
was
warm
with
understanding
as
she
said
yes
he
s
your
first
then
she
smiled
gently
as
she
added
but
i
know
it
was
hard
for
you
to
give
up
your
dream
of
being
a
don
t
think
i
m
bitter
about
it
kitty
hastened
to
assure
her
i
adore
billy
he
s
worth
any
sacrifice
i
could
make
but
if
i
could
help
somewhere
to
hasten
the
end
of
this
war
nothing
would
make
me
that
s
certainly
miss
pearson
glanced
with
a
comradely
look
at
brad
i
ll
say
he
agreed
heartily
do
you
think
i
could
get
into
the
canteen
corps
mason
says
you
don
t
have
to
live
away
from
of
course
they
ll
be
delighted
to
have
you
my
dear
come
over
to
the
station
wagon
and
i
ll
give
you
some
leaflets
telling
about
our
wait
a
minute
till
i
get
billy
he
ll
be
sure
to
fall
in
the
pond
if
i
go
out
of
you
go
long
i
ll
look
after
billy
volunteered
brad
i
like
that
boy
he
s
enough
like
my
oldest
sister
s
kid
to
be
his
as
they
turned
toward
the
station
wagon
that
had
brought
over
the
canteen
supplies
kitty
began
to
have
misgivings
maybe
i
can
t
do
this
sort
of
thing
at
all
you
know
i
majored
in
music
at
you
like
to
eat
don
t
you
retorted
miss
pearson
in
that
snappy
way
she
had
i
ll
say
and
cook
too
it
s
one
of
my
well
then
what
are
you
worrying
about
she
reached
to
the
car
seat
and
took
out
a
brief
case
packed
with
notebooks
and
leaflets
this
little
book
will
tell
you
what
the
canteen
corps
as
kitty
took
the
blue
book
with
the
red
cross
on
the
cover
she
exclaimed
oh
it
s
part
of
the
red
cross
work
of
course
what
did
you
think
it
was
i
hadn
t
thought
this
will
make
it
all
the
more
wonderful
working
with
the
red
cross
you
know
i
think
that
s
the
most
marvelous
organization
it
s
simply
great
what
they
do
for
anybody
miss
pearson
smiled
at
the
exaggeration
well
my
dear
it
s
not
quite
so
comprehensive
as
that
but
we
do
stand
ready
to
help
in
all
emergencies
and
that
s
where
the
canteen
workers
play
such
an
important
part
we
are
ready
to
feed
people
after
air
raids
storms
floods
and
disasters
of
all
oh
that
is
important
and
we
must
work
under
all
sorts
of
handicaps
we
often
have
to
prepare
large
quantities
of
food
right
out
in
the
i
learned
something
of
outdoor
cooking
in
my
girl
scout
work
years
ago
said
kitty
proudly
then
you
already
have
a
splendid
foundation
some
scouts
are
helping
us
this
what
must
i
do
to
get
in
when
can
i
start
first
you
must
take
a
course
in
nutrition
i
m
starting
a
new
class
next
monday
is
the
class
filled
i
hope
i
can
get
i
already
have
a
full
class
but
i
can
make
room
for
someone
like
you
you
see
lots
of
women
take
this
course
even
when
they
can
t
follow
it
up
with
canteen
when
this
course
is
finished
may
i
sign
up
for
canteen
work
you
have
to
follow
the
nutrition
course
with
a
course
in
canteen
wish
i
d
started
sooner
so
i
d
be
ready
for
work
the
course
may
seem
long
but
there
s
much
more
to
canteen
work
than
the
foundation
course
and
emergency
feeding
we
do
so
many
things
we
often
serve
refreshments
at
blood
donation
centers
we
have
snack
bars
in
uso
halls
sometimes
our
canteen
women
help
with
school
lunch
counters
or
in
day
there
s
one
over
on
palmetto
island
where
billy
sometimes
so
you
live
on
palmetto
island
that
s
all
to
the
good
we
re
badly
in
need
of
workers
oh
i
m
so
happy
to
learn
about
this
and
you
still
think
i
can
do
it
and
not
neglect
my
duty
to
billy
of
course
my
dear
we
have
many
mothers
with
several
children
who
manage
to
keep
up
their
quota
of
canteen
hours
every
year
and
not
neglect
their
homes
in
fact
they
re
better
mothers
and
homemakers
for
having
taken
the
i
ve
got
to
hug
exclaimed
kitty
impulsively
throwing
her
arms
around
miss
pearson
it
s
so
wonderful
to
find
something
i
can
really
do
to
when
miss
pearson
had
told
her
the
time
and
place
of
the
nutrition
class
kitty
hurried
back
to
billy
wondering
if
she
would
ever
have
patience
to
wait
till
monday
to
begin
her
training
chapter
two
a
strange
meeting
will
i
be
eating
sandwiches
you
made
the
next
time
the
canteen
serves
here
brad
mason
s
eyes
twinkled
teasingly
as
he
put
the
question
to
kitty
when
she
returned
to
the
duck
pond
are
you
really
going
to
take
the
canteen
course
i
wouldn
t
miss
it
for
worlds
and
say
i
owe
you
a
vote
of
thanks
if
you
hadn
t
dropped
those
remarks
about
the
canteen
work
i
might
never
have
thought
of
and
what
a
prize
they
would
have
missed
kitty
flushed
as
she
took
billy
s
hand
and
told
him
it
was
time
to
go
home
it
was
strange
how
brad
mason
seemed
like
someone
she
had
always
known
wait
a
minute
now
exclaimed
brad
pretending
to
be
angry
you
can
t
walk
out
of
my
life
like
this
after
all
we
ve
been
introduced
properly
with
miss
pearson
as
kitty
glanced
up
into
his
face
as
she
buttoned
billy
s
coat
then
they
laughed
gayly
at
least
you
might
tell
me
where
you
live
brad
persisted
on
palmetto
island
near
the
hospital
my
dad
works
there
he
s
a
chief
pharmacist
s
not
really
maybe
you
know
him
since
you
re
in
the
why
were
as
good
as
in
the
same
family
i
work
in
the
registrar
s
office
at
the
kitty
thought
he
was
joking
and
said
so
i
don
t
remember
ever
seeing
you
been
on
leave
for
two
weeks
and
i
had
a
little
sick
spell
before
oh
then
that
explains
odd
i
never
saw
you
i
came
home
from
college
about
a
month
ago
dad
s
been
down
here
two
yeah
i
know
him
well
he
s
tops
we
think
so
don
t
we
billy
you
bet
he
s
the
bravest
man
in
the
whole
kitty
made
a
move
to
leave
the
park
but
brad
followed
i
didn
t
parade
i
got
into
town
only
today
couldn
t
i
ride
the
bus
back
to
the
island
with
you
i
came
in
our
launch
i
have
to
wait
and
meet
someone
who
is
coming
in
on
the
train
but
say
if
you
re
not
in
a
hurry
we
d
be
glad
to
have
you
ride
back
across
the
bay
with
us
there
s
plenty
of
that
ll
be
the
town
busses
were
so
packed
with
people
going
home
from
the
parade
they
decided
to
walk
to
the
railroad
station
as
it
was
only
a
few
blocks
down
the
street
when
billy
got
too
tired
brad
took
him
astride
his
shoulders
and
didn
t
seem
to
care
a
bit
if
anyone
stared
at
him
going
to
meet
some
girl
friend
he
asked
when
they
were
in
sight
of
the
station
no
a
new
nurse
is
coming
to
the
hospital
i
think
she
has
worked
in
some
hospital
with
dad
before
he
knew
all
the
island
busses
would
be
jammed
after
the
parade
so
suggested
i
come
over
in
the
launch
and
bring
her
as
kitty
had
never
seen
hazel
dawson
she
was
a
little
uneasy
for
fear
she
would
slip
through
the
train
gates
unrecognized
there
were
several
smartly
uniformed
women
among
the
travelers
wacs
and
waves
and
women
marines
most
of
them
hurried
by
as
if
familiar
with
the
station
and
town
then
she
saw
a
navy
nurse
following
a
redcap
loaded
with
bags
kitty
was
still
hesitating
when
the
nurse
paused
suddenly
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
kitty
began
she
got
no
further
when
the
nurse
exclaimed
why
you
must
be
kitty
carter
or
her
then
you
miss
dawson
no
other
but
i
didn
t
expect
anyone
to
meet
kitty
explained
about
the
parade
and
the
crowded
busses
then
introduced
brad
and
billy
this
really
is
an
honor
it
seems
almost
like
going
home
to
have
someone
meet
me
said
miss
dawson
happily
they
caught
a
taxi
outside
the
station
after
the
flurry
of
seeing
about
baggage
hazel
dawson
seemed
tired
as
she
settled
back
in
the
car
seat
kitty
glanced
fleetingly
at
her
face
to
see
a
weary
worried
expression
in
her
eyes
tired
she
asked
sympathetically
somehow
she
felt
strangely
drawn
to
this
older
woman
she
judged
ensign
dawson
to
be
somewhere
in
her
thirties
evidently
she
had
already
seen
real
action
on
her
coat
she
wore
the
yellow
ribbon
for
south
pacific
service
and
two
stars
indicating
she
had
been
in
two
major
engagements
her
eyes
held
the
shadowed
yet
kindly
light
of
one
who
eased
much
suffering
not
too
tired
she
replied
to
kitty
s
question
as
she
forced
a
smile
to
her
lips
she
studied
the
girl
s
face
thoughtfully
a
moment
before
she
added
so
you
re
kitty
they
say
i
look
like
you
do
i
had
no
trouble
recognizing
you
wherever
your
dad
is
he
always
keeps
your
picture
and
billy
s
on
his
illustration
then
you
are
miss
dawson
kitty
so
you
ve
served
with
him
before
we
worked
together
several
months
in
the
pacific
and
were
in
the
same
hospital
at
i
didn
t
visit
dad
when
he
was
at
annapolis
you
see
ever
since
the
war
began
i
ve
been
cramming
winter
and
summer
to
get
my
degree
i
wanted
to
get
through
as
soon
as
i
could
and
join
the
yes
your
father
told
the
you
had
to
change
your
hazel
sent
an
understanding
glance
toward
billy
sitting
on
brad
s
lap
but
i
m
going
to
be
able
to
help
after
all
said
kitty
eagerly
really
then
you
ve
made
arrangements
for
the
boy
oh
no
i
can
help
and
still
keep
our
little
home
i
m
going
into
canteen
that
s
splendid
i
might
never
have
thought
of
it
if
i
hadn
t
met
brad
mason
oh
you
only
met
brad
grinned
boyishly
i
thought
it
was
important
to
get
acquainted
with
her
even
if
i
did
have
to
use
billy
as
a
billy
as
a
exclaimed
kitty
shocked
do
you
mean
you
made
that
sailboat
for
him
with
an
ulterior
motive
i
ll
have
to
plead
guilty
but
brad
s
hearty
laugh
betrayed
no
sense
of
guilt
when
i
saw
you
sitting
on
that
bench
looking
so
pensive
i
said
to
myself
now
there
s
a
pretty
girl
who
needs
and
we
women
have
the
idea
it
s
the
service
men
who
need
cheering
said
hazel
kitty
laughed
in
spite
of
her
chagrin
well
i
ll
have
to
hand
it
to
you
for
being
a
she
admitted
how
did
he
stir
up
your
interest
in
canteen
work
asked
hazel
entering
gayly
into
their
banter
kitty
gave
a
sprightly
account
of
their
meeting
and
ended
by
saying
and
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
i
had
practically
joined
the
canteen
corps
and
invited
brad
to
ride
home
with
but
you
can
bet
she
wouldn
t
have
done
it
if
you
hadn
t
been
coming
along
i
know
kitty
s
kind
she
s
a
stickler
for
oh
not
really
just
the
same
it
ll
do
you
no
end
of
good
being
a
canteen
worker
brad
persisted
kitty
was
about
to
make
a
saucy
retort
when
billy
piped
up
look
kit
there
s
the
red
cross
station
wagon
sure
enough
they
were
passing
the
park
where
the
station
wagon
was
being
loaded
again
miss
pearson
glanced
her
way
and
waved
i
think
she
s
going
to
be
nice
to
work
with
said
kitty
happily
i
can
hardly
wait
till
monday
to
begin
my
can
i
ride
in
the
station
wagon
with
you
when
you
re
a
canteen
worker
billy
wanted
to
know
if
they
ll
let
at
the
corner
where
they
had
to
turn
toward
the
docks
the
taxi
was
held
up
by
traffic
a
crowded
palmetto
island
bus
in
front
of
them
was
loading
passengers
a
dozen
or
more
people
couldn
t
get
on
at
all
among
them
kitty
noticed
lieutenant
cary
one
of
the
physicians
from
their
own
hospital
it
seemed
a
shame
to
leave
him
to
wait
for
the
next
bus
when
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
their
launch
as
the
taxi
crept
through
the
traffic
near
the
spot
where
the
young
lieutenant
stood
she
called
out
to
him
come
down
to
the
she
pointed
down
the
side
street
toward
the
bay
we
ll
give
you
a
ride
over
to
the
island
in
our
he
acknowledged
her
invitation
with
a
dignified
bow
when
they
moved
on
kitty
turned
to
brad
and
said
seemed
a
shame
not
to
pick
him
up
you
know
him
of
cary
oh
kitty
was
surprised
to
find
brad
s
cool
tone
reflecting
some
of
her
own
instinctive
dislike
of
the
man
she
tried
to
disregard
the
feeling
for
she
scarcely
knew
lieutenant
cary
she
had
encountered
him
only
a
few
times
in
her
father
s
office
at
the
hospital
though
he
made
obvious
efforts
to
be
friendly
kitty
had
an
unaccountable
aversion
for
him
but
she
could
not
let
her
ungrounded
prejudice
go
so
far
as
to
make
her
pass
by
one
of
her
father
s
when
she
had
plenty
of
room
to
take
him
home
transportation
conditions
were
bad
enough
without
anyone
traveling
with
unused
space
brad
was
most
helpful
in
loading
hazel
s
suitcases
into
the
launch
by
the
time
they
had
loaded
the
launch
and
warmed
the
motor
lieutenant
cary
came
sprinting
toward
them
brad
and
miss
dawson
saluted
their
superior
officer
as
the
physician
paused
a
moment
on
the
dock
this
is
really
kind
of
you
miss
carter
cary
said
stepping
into
the
launch
i
had
no
idea
there
d
be
such
a
traffic
jam
when
i
came
miss
dawson
may
i
present
lieutenant
cary
said
kitty
while
cary
still
stood
beside
her
in
the
middle
of
the
launch
he
bowed
with
what
kitty
thought
exaggerated
formality
under
the
cramped
conditions
you
re
the
new
nurse
scheduled
to
begin
work
tomorrow
i
presume
that
is
correct
lieutenant
kitty
felt
as
if
icy
spray
had
been
dashed
into
her
face
at
the
coolness
of
the
tone
you
re
no
relation
of
mate
willard
dawson
i
presume
questioned
the
lieutenant
i
m
proud
to
say
he
s
my
brother
hazel
dawson
spoke
the
words
almost
with
defiance
kitty
standing
between
the
two
wondered
what
all
this
meant
their
antagonistic
attitude
was
most
unaccountable
she
glanced
at
brad
to
find
a
strained
embarrassed
look
on
his
face
kitty
deliberately
raced
the
engine
to
end
the
awkward
moment
as
she
slowly
and
skillfully
steered
the
launch
through
the
harbor
traffic
she
wondered
what
all
this
meant
who
was
this
mysterious
willard
dawson
and
why
should
hazel
be
so
in
her
assertion
that
he
was
her
brother
fortunately
hazel
was
in
the
prow
while
lieutenant
cary
sat
in
the
stern
with
brad
billy
always
wanted
to
stand
in
the
prow
so
nurse
dawson
kept
a
protecting
arm
around
him
while
kitty
ran
the
boat
kitty
s
father
had
said
many
times
that
she
had
been
born
with
the
salt
of
the
sea
in
her
veins
like
all
the
carters
two
generations
of
naval
officers
had
been
preceded
by
a
who
was
captain
of
his
own
sailing
vessel
so
kitty
had
only
been
following
the
family
tradition
when
she
aspired
toward
the
waves
but
she
decided
that
afternoon
as
she
headed
back
toward
palmetto
island
that
serving
the
canteen
was
the
perfect
substitute
under
the
circumstances
the
noise
of
the
motor
made
conversation
difficult
and
she
was
rather
glad
of
it
for
the
afternoon
had
been
so
eventful
she
had
much
to
think
about
first
and
foremost
was
her
delight
in
making
a
service
link
and
meeting
was
something
she
would
never
forget
and
hazel
dawson
too
she
sensed
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
and
different
sort
of
friendship
she
wondered
why
the
thought
of
cary
chilled
her
ardor
did
brad
know
why
these
two
seemed
to
freeze
on
meeting
she
meant
to
ask
him
when
she
had
a
chance
hazel
caught
her
attention
waving
toward
the
receding
shores
beautiful
she
exclaimed
above
the
noise
of
the
motor
you
ll
love
it
kitty
told
her
i
ll
take
you
boat
riding
even
if
we
have
to
row
to
save
gas
you
must
see
these
intriguing
marshes
and
the
beautiful
shore
lines
with
the
wonderful
live
oaks
draped
in
spanish
this
is
my
first
trip
south
in
my
own
country
hazel
told
her
palmetto
island
now
came
into
view
with
its
many
smokestacks
marking
the
sky
line
a
fringe
of
palmettoes
farther
east
was
lost
in
the
mists
where
the
inland
waterways
met
the
sea
kitty
pointed
to
the
western
shore
where
a
large
white
building
stood
on
the
point
there
s
the
bernard
general
hospital
she
said
to
hazel
our
house
isn
t
far
away
and
the
marine
base
is
farther
east
and
a
lovely
spot
kitty
thought
she
caught
a
wistful
note
in
hazel
s
voice
and
her
eyes
were
almost
sad
as
she
drank
in
the
beauty
of
green
marshes
the
blue
sky
and
the
bluer
sea
on
reaching
the
island
docks
kitty
phoned
her
father
as
they
had
previously
arranged
to
send
down
a
car
when
she
came
out
of
the
warehouse
where
she
had
used
the
phone
lieutenant
cary
was
gone
we
could
have
taken
him
up
with
us
she
said
embarrassed
that
she
had
failed
to
invite
him
specifically
before
she
had
gone
to
phone
her
father
he
said
he
had
to
stop
on
the
way
up
to
see
a
friend
brad
explained
he
left
his
thanks
to
you
for
giving
him
a
then
to
kitty
s
amazement
brad
added
in
a
low
tone
through
almost
closed
teeth
good
riddance
if
you
ask
me
that
night
at
supper
kitty
gave
her
father
an
account
of
her
unusual
afternoon
the
main
point
of
which
was
to
tell
him
she
wanted
to
begin
canteen
training
i
m
proud
of
you
kitty
that
you
wouldn
t
give
up
till
you
found
some
way
you
could
serve
under
the
circumstances
said
her
father
then
you
do
think
i
can
do
it
of
course
there
s
nothing
to
prevent
we
ll
have
to
pay
jane
extra
to
stay
with
billy
the
nights
i
m
on
duty
can
we
afford
that
certainly
my
dear
i
ve
been
thinking
we
might
fix
up
that
room
behind
the
kitchen
so
jane
can
be
here
all
the
that
s
a
swell
idea
dad
i
d
think
she
d
be
glad
to
have
a
place
rent
free
last
week
she
had
to
borrow
money
to
pay
her
they
talked
over
further
details
of
the
new
arrangement
for
their
combination
nurse
and
cook
but
even
while
they
discussed
their
domestic
problems
kitty
s
mind
kept
going
back
to
the
meeting
between
lieutenant
cary
and
ensign
dawson
finally
she
blurted
out
dad
did
you
ever
know
willard
dawson
hazel
s
brother
he
glanced
at
her
sharply
no
he
left
before
i
came
i
was
sent
to
take
his
then
he
worked
a
while
with
lieutenant
cary
of
course
cary
has
been
here
six
months
but
why
do
you
ask
then
kitty
attempted
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
meeting
on
the
launch
and
the
animosity
she
felt
existed
between
the
two
strangers
her
father
tried
to
brush
her
suspicions
aside
you
mustn
t
get
the
habit
of
attributing
motives
to
every
little
thing
people
do
kitty
often
people
are
merely
tired
or
preoccupied
and
their
coolness
has
no
significance
at
but
kitty
was
not
satisfied
with
this
explanation
she
felt
that
her
father
knew
much
more
about
the
mysterious
willard
dawson
than
he
had
revealed
chapter
three
the
uso
party
all
the
next
day
though
kitty
had
many
obligations
and
numerous
things
on
her
mind
her
thoughts
continually
returned
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
her
boat
ride
from
town
there
was
something
very
mysterious
about
the
whole
business
she
felt
certain
her
father
had
evaded
telling
her
all
he
might
have
was
the
new
nurse
involved
in
some
mystery
suddenly
kitty
recalled
brad
s
worried
expression
at
the
meeting
of
the
two
he
looked
like
one
who
suspected
the
cause
of
the
disharmony
though
she
could
not
question
nurse
dawson
there
was
no
reason
why
she
shouldn
t
talk
to
brad
about
what
had
happened
maybe
she
would
see
him
at
the
uso
party
saturday
night
as
she
dressed
for
the
party
the
following
night
kitty
s
thoughts
were
busy
with
what
she
would
say
to
brad
all
the
girls
were
wearing
gay
evening
clothes
even
though
they
were
gowns
for
this
made
the
occasion
seem
festive
for
the
boys
vera
parsons
a
member
of
the
motor
corps
who
drove
the
station
wagon
around
to
collect
the
girls
for
the
uso
parties
honked
before
kitty
had
quite
finished
dressing
she
threw
her
coat
around
her
shoulders
caught
up
the
skirt
of
the
fluffy
evening
dress
of
pale
yellow
and
hurried
toward
the
front
door
she
felt
buoyantly
happy
as
she
kissed
billy
good
night
and
joined
the
girls
life
had
become
an
interesting
adventure
once
more
with
a
goal
to
work
toward
she
had
the
happy
feeling
of
one
who
had
at
last
found
a
niche
into
which
she
fitted
perfectly
kitty
had
been
to
only
one
other
uso
dance
for
she
had
been
in
no
mood
for
parties
when
she
first
joined
her
father
on
the
island
she
missed
her
aunt
nina
too
keenly
it
was
vera
parsons
who
made
her
realize
these
dances
were
not
like
most
others
she
would
not
be
going
merely
for
her
own
pleasure
but
to
help
the
boys
forget
they
were
homesick
and
lonely
and
still
had
a
big
job
ahead
of
them
you
know
they
won
t
allow
just
any
sort
of
girl
to
go
to
these
dances
vera
told
her
only
those
of
the
highest
caliber
they
re
not
always
easy
to
find
especially
on
an
island
as
small
as
palmetto
we
need
all
the
nice
girls
we
can
get
to
help
us
so
kitty
had
attended
the
dance
last
tuesday
and
enjoyed
it
immensely
it
was
then
she
had
noticed
though
only
casually
the
snack
bar
which
the
canteen
operated
tonight
she
planned
to
give
the
bar
more
than
a
brief
inspection
and
to
get
acquainted
with
the
workers
vera
knew
all
the
girls
and
introduced
kitty
she
had
been
on
the
island
a
year
and
was
acquainted
with
everyone
who
was
helping
with
war
work
vera
was
a
most
capable
girl
large
and
rather
muscular
but
with
such
a
wholesome
attitude
kitty
warmed
to
her
at
once
she
had
come
upon
her
the
first
time
on
a
sandy
road
running
through
a
palmetto
thicket
vera
was
changing
a
tire
with
as
much
ease
as
a
garage
mechanic
kitty
later
learned
that
she
was
the
type
of
girl
who
doesn
t
hesitate
to
put
her
hands
to
any
task
her
reddish
brown
hair
snapping
brown
eyes
and
gusty
manner
won
her
friends
wherever
she
went
well
kitty
carter
s
soon
going
to
be
one
of
you
was
her
method
of
introducing
the
canteen
candidate
to
the
girls
behind
the
snack
bar
kitty
this
is
evans
she
s
chairman
of
the
corps
over
here
and
this
is
sally
bright
and
judy
we
ll
surely
be
glad
to
have
you
spoke
up
evans
a
thin
sprightly
woman
in
her
fifties
though
much
older
than
the
other
two
she
was
still
young
enough
in
spirit
to
be
comradely
i
can
hardly
wait
to
begin
my
training
said
kitty
perching
on
one
of
the
stools
and
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
counter
when
do
you
start
asked
sally
illustration
we
ll
be
glad
to
have
you
evans
monday
the
nutrition
class
yes
that
must
come
first
evans
told
her
it
s
a
prerequisite
to
the
canteen
course
we
have
to
know
a
lot
about
food
since
our
job
is
feeding
people
under
all
sorts
of
and
we
have
to
know
how
to
wash
a
stack
of
dishes
as
high
as
the
washington
monument
put
in
judy
conner
with
a
groan
fortunately
no
one
has
to
do
that
all
the
time
evans
explained
we
take
turns
doing
the
different
tasks
so
everyone
has
an
opportunity
to
gain
i
m
always
glad
when
it
comes
my
turn
to
make
out
menus
said
judy
but
sally
actually
likes
to
clean
up
can
you
imagine
that
sally
s
button
nose
wrinkled
as
her
round
face
spread
into
a
grin
strange
but
true
i
like
to
bring
order
out
of
isn
t
it
wonderful
that
we
have
a
group
where
different
ones
like
to
do
different
things
said
evans
happily
i
like
to
cook
kitty
told
them
i
like
experimenting
and
creating
new
concoctions
and
trying
out
new
i
m
afraid
there
won
t
be
much
opportunity
for
new
dishes
in
this
work
but
you
ll
be
given
plenty
of
opportunity
to
cook
if
you
like
kitty
glanced
at
sally
with
a
look
of
appreciation
but
i
just
can
t
imagine
anyone
really
liking
to
clean
a
they
re
rare
birds
giggled
judy
it
gives
my
esthetic
nature
a
keen
satisfaction
to
leave
a
kitchen
after
the
hullabaloo
is
over
sally
explained
sometimes
she
is
too
anxious
to
clean
judy
reported
she
has
a
way
of
cleaning
up
bowls
and
spoons
before
the
cooks
have
finished
with
sally
went
back
to
the
kitchen
to
end
their
teasing
and
kitty
asked
is
the
nutrition
course
very
hard
oh
no
miss
pearson
makes
it
very
interesting
you
learn
all
about
food
needs
in
emergencies
and
food
values
for
all
times
explained
evans
i
guess
we
could
all
learn
a
lot
about
indeed
we
could
part
of
our
work
too
is
giving
instructions
and
demonstrations
to
people
good
health
and
sane
living
are
so
dependent
on
proper
more
so
than
most
people
will
admit
said
judy
you
ll
learn
about
that
in
nutrition
well
it
seems
i
m
in
line
to
learn
lots
that
will
help
me
even
after
the
war
is
won
kitty
answered
and
she
felt
her
interest
and
anticipation
in
the
work
increasing
the
most
exciting
part
of
the
work
comes
at
the
time
of
an
emergency
explained
evans
i
helped
once
during
a
flood
out
in
mississippi
that
was
when
i
first
went
into
canteen
when
we
read
about
such
things
in
the
papers
they
seem
so
unreal
and
far
away
said
kitty
suddenly
feeling
a
great
sense
of
responsibility
in
her
new
undertaking
she
realized
now
that
a
canteen
worker
must
have
the
courage
and
endurance
of
a
true
soldier
if
she
was
to
fulfill
her
obligations
there
was
much
more
she
wanted
to
ask
evans
and
the
girls
but
at
that
moment
the
band
began
playing
and
jimmy
barnes
a
young
storekeeper
came
to
ask
her
to
dance
with
him
the
second
dance
had
just
begun
when
someone
tapped
her
partner
on
the
shoulder
kitty
looked
over
the
sailor
s
shoulder
to
see
the
spotless
white
of
a
naval
officer
s
uniform
she
was
surprised
to
recognize
lieutenant
cary
she
could
not
suppress
a
startled
exclamation
oh
you
sorry
to
break
in
but
i
had
to
apologize
for
leaving
yesterday
at
the
dock
without
telling
you
how
much
i
appreciated
the
ride
from
town
but
i
was
late
for
an
oh
that
was
dad
had
told
me
to
phone
so
we
d
have
a
way
of
getting
miss
dawson
s
bags
up
from
the
so
she
s
an
old
friend
though
the
young
doctor
s
words
seemed
harmless
enough
kitty
was
instantly
on
the
defensive
guardedly
she
replied
i
never
saw
her
till
though
you
met
her
at
the
train
kitty
noticed
how
blond
the
lieutenant
s
eyebrows
were
when
he
lifted
them
with
a
skeptical
expression
she
made
no
reply
to
his
last
remark
not
knowing
how
best
to
speak
he
seemed
to
take
the
hint
that
the
subject
was
closed
and
after
an
interval
said
you
dance
you
look
charming
tonight
he
persisted
she
flushed
in
spite
of
not
wanting
him
to
pay
her
compliments
she
was
about
to
make
a
pert
retort
when
she
reminded
herself
that
he
too
was
in
the
service
even
though
she
disliked
him
personally
after
all
she
had
come
here
to
try
to
make
these
men
who
were
serving
her
country
a
bit
happier
suddenly
she
caught
sight
of
brad
watching
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
to
her
relief
the
band
crashed
out
the
finale
at
that
moment
and
brad
came
to
claim
her
for
the
next
dance
so
glad
you
came
kitty
said
cordially
no
gladder
than
i
he
grinned
as
he
looked
her
over
with
a
sauciness
at
which
no
one
could
take
offense
then
he
whistled
softly
gosh
but
you
look
like
a
dream
walking
but
i
came
here
to
dance
not
you
didn
t
come
here
to
dance
with
lieutenant
cary
from
now
on
if
i
have
anything
to
do
with
why
he
dances
kitty
found
herself
defending
the
man
she
didn
t
like
just
to
take
brad
down
a
peg
or
two
maybe
he
learned
his
dance
steps
where
the
great
strauss
waltzes
were
brad
glanced
around
before
he
added
you
mean
we
can
t
talk
here
he
warned
quietly
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
something
did
you
he
asked
eagerly
he
took
her
arm
and
started
toward
the
rear
door
some
steps
led
down
to
a
court
with
a
fountain
in
the
center
and
natural
palms
around
it
there
were
dim
lights
and
a
hostess
to
make
everyone
welcome
brad
found
a
seat
at
the
far
end
where
the
lights
were
dimmed
enough
for
them
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
stars
kitty
glanced
around
to
be
sure
that
no
one
else
was
within
hearing
distance
brad
did
you
notice
anything
odd
yesterday
when
i
introduced
nurse
dawson
to
lieutenant
cary
plenty
he
spoke
the
word
with
significance
they
seemed
to
have
an
innate
animosity
for
each
other
when
obviously
they
had
never
met
if
you
ask
me
kitty
it
was
a
blow
to
lieutenant
cary
to
discover
ensign
dawson
on
her
way
to
bernard
but
why
well
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
it
seems
so
of
it
must
be
a
mighty
big
hunch
for
i
have
the
same
sort
of
feeling
that
something
s
wrong
somewhere
miss
dawson
looked
so
sort
of
guess
she
has
enough
to
make
her
feel
depressed
and
definitely
at
being
sent
to
this
hospital
of
all
why
something
happened
while
her
brother
was
here
he
left
under
a
sort
of
shadow
was
shipped
off
to
you
mean
he
almost
got
a
well
not
quite
but
i
heard
things
were
terribly
mixed
up
in
his
work
he
was
chief
pharmacist
s
mate
like
your
i
wonder
what
was
wrong
that
s
what
i
haven
t
been
able
to
find
out
but
on
several
occasions
i
heard
him
and
lieutenant
cary
having
rather
hot
arguments
i
could
never
get
to
the
root
of
their
then
you
think
lieutenant
cary
had
something
to
do
with
dawson
s
leaving
the
hospital
i
m
convinced
of
did
you
know
him
very
well
i
wasn
t
there
long
before
he
left
but
i
liked
him
an
awful
naturally
lieutenant
cary
would
resent
nurse
dawson
being
sent
to
the
same
and
he
didn
t
make
any
bones
about
showing
it
said
brad
in
disgust
kitty
watched
some
couples
go
back
to
the
dance
hall
as
the
band
struck
up
again
after
an
interval
she
said
brad
i
believe
dad
knows
something
about
all
he
ought
to
if
anyone
does
they
put
him
in
the
position
dawson
had
he
shut
up
like
a
clam
when
i
told
him
what
happened
in
the
launch
kitty
sat
turning
the
opal
ring
on
her
third
finger
as
she
puzzled
over
the
complications
you
have
nice
brad
told
her
that
s
from
all
the
years
of
piano
practice
you
have
to
have
piano
you
know
along
with
voice
some
time
will
you
sing
for
me
she
smiled
up
into
his
eager
eyes
i
d
love
to
but
right
now
brad
i
can
t
think
of
anything
but
this
queer
business
we
ve
stumbled
on
i
have
a
queer
feeling
it
may
mean
real
trouble
at
the
oh
i
don
t
think
it
s
anything
as
serious
as
that
but
i
ll
tell
you
frankly
i
don
t
trust
lieutenant
cary
he
s
a
man
who
ll
bear
watching
all
right
i
heard
that
just
a
year
before
the
war
broke
out
he
was
studying
surgery
in
vienna
and
chapter
four
emergency
feeding
kitty
was
glad
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
monday
morning
when
she
ran
to
the
window
to
look
out
she
felt
eager
and
ready
to
tackle
the
toughest
sort
of
job
she
could
face
her
friends
with
new
assurance
now
for
she
was
soon
to
be
a
part
of
the
great
army
of
workers
dedicated
to
restoring
peace
to
a
troubled
world
for
a
while
at
least
while
their
gasoline
allowance
lasted
she
was
going
back
and
forth
in
the
launch
as
that
would
save
at
least
an
hour
each
day
in
transportation
time
two
other
girls
from
the
island
were
going
to
take
the
course
with
her
and
share
those
rides
so
she
felt
justified
in
the
use
of
gasoline
she
had
spent
the
early
years
of
her
life
on
the
gulf
coast
and
was
perfectly
at
home
on
the
water
and
how
she
loved
it
vera
parsons
had
decided
to
add
the
canteen
course
to
her
other
lines
of
service
and
sally
bright
s
sister
lana
was
joining
also
i
hope
the
course
won
t
be
too
dry
mused
lana
when
they
were
crossing
the
bay
that
first
morning
it
won
t
be
if
miss
pearson
s
in
charge
vera
assured
her
she
could
put
pep
into
a
i
wish
i
could
begin
work
right
now
said
kitty
i
don
t
see
how
i
ll
have
patience
to
wait
to
finish
the
there
s
nothing
to
keep
you
from
helping
right
now
vera
told
her
there
re
lots
of
canteen
canteen
aides
girls
who
haven
t
taken
the
courses
but
do
volunteer
work
in
oh
that
s
great
i
want
to
get
into
it
as
soon
as
possible
i
ve
felt
like
a
shirker
these
last
i
don
t
see
why
you
call
yourself
a
shirker
consoled
lana
with
a
kid
brother
a
dad
and
a
cottage
to
look
after
i
should
think
you
d
have
your
hands
the
nutrition
classes
were
being
held
in
the
power
company
s
demonstration
kitchen
the
trio
from
palmetto
island
found
about
thirty
women
and
girls
gathered
when
they
arrived
miss
pearson
spotless
in
her
attractive
uniform
was
already
giving
out
mimeographed
sheets
for
study
all
the
seats
toward
the
back
were
taken
but
kitty
and
her
friends
found
folding
chairs
near
the
demonstration
table
where
miss
pearson
had
her
materials
spread
out
kitty
thought
how
easy
it
was
to
slip
into
the
old
habit
of
making
notes
at
lectures
when
she
took
a
notebook
and
fountain
pen
from
her
purse
miss
pearson
had
not
been
lecturing
half
an
hour
when
kitty
realized
how
valuable
the
classes
were
going
to
be
she
could
use
the
information
now
and
long
after
the
war
i
want
to
sketch
briefly
what
we
must
cover
in
this
course
miss
pearson
began
as
a
foundation
every
one
must
know
the
requirements
of
good
nutrition
and
the
value
of
different
kinds
of
kitty
thought
how
little
attention
she
had
paid
to
such
matters
in
the
years
she
had
been
concentrating
on
her
music
she
had
eaten
what
was
put
before
her
at
school
and
had
given
no
heed
to
it
unless
she
became
ill
and
the
doctor
restricted
her
diet
when
miss
pearson
mentioned
that
she
would
give
assistance
in
planning
menus
to
fit
food
rationing
situations
kitty
was
really
delighted
that
planning
had
been
a
mathematical
problem
to
her
ever
since
she
had
started
housekeeping
field
trips
to
large
kitchens
of
the
community
and
to
food
preserving
plants
promised
interesting
diversions
to
classroom
activities
tomorrow
morning
i
ve
arranged
for
us
to
visit
the
bayshore
bakery
after
class
miss
pearson
told
them
there
you
ll
learn
a
little
about
mass
production
you
see
we
have
to
be
prepared
to
cook
large
quantities
of
food
in
times
of
kitty
saw
that
there
was
going
to
be
real
work
also
in
the
course
at
the
bottom
of
their
instruction
sheets
were
some
questions
that
must
be
answered
next
day
in
class
we
can
discuss
these
going
and
coming
in
the
boat
kitty
suggested
to
her
friends
as
they
were
going
out
i
really
think
it
s
going
to
be
fun
lana
said
and
very
valuable
too
said
kitty
i
noticed
a
couple
of
women
from
over
at
the
oyster
cannery
settlement
said
vera
every
woman
over
there
ought
to
be
taking
this
course
for
the
good
of
her
family
miss
pearson
is
going
to
show
us
how
to
make
a
little
bit
go
a
long
that
s
surely
something
we
can
all
use
said
kitty
their
excursion
to
the
bakery
was
followed
by
a
visit
to
the
oyster
cannery
the
community
cannery
a
cafeteria
kitchen
and
to
a
school
lunchroom
which
was
most
efficiently
organized
every
person
in
that
lunchroom
took
our
nutrition
course
when
i
first
gave
it
explained
miss
pearson
kitty
found
it
hard
to
believe
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
that
half
her
nutrition
course
was
already
complete
she
had
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
to
be
a
part
of
a
great
scheme
like
this
in
which
everyone
was
cooperating
for
the
general
welfare
gave
her
a
glow
of
satisfaction
she
didn
t
mind
at
all
that
she
had
to
work
till
bedtime
to
finish
her
home
duties
to
see
about
billy
s
clothes
and
plan
her
own
food
program
for
the
next
day
in
her
carefree
days
at
college
she
had
not
dreamed
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
in
the
world
classes
were
held
in
the
evening
during
the
second
week
of
the
course
this
was
a
compromise
to
fit
the
needs
of
several
housewives
who
found
it
difficult
to
leave
home
in
the
morning
this
arrangement
made
it
necessary
for
kitty
vera
and
lana
to
ride
the
island
busses
as
the
girls
could
not
go
alone
in
the
launch
at
night
palmetto
island
was
connected
with
the
mainland
by
a
long
causeway
across
the
marshes
this
made
the
bus
trip
about
three
times
the
length
of
the
boat
ride
the
second
evening
as
the
girls
were
returning
home
about
the
bus
stopped
near
the
oyster
cannery
to
pick
up
some
passengers
one
of
them
was
a
sailor
wearing
the
crescent
of
the
galley
service
he
impressed
kitty
as
being
a
raw
recruit
though
kitty
was
preoccupied
with
her
own
thoughts
about
the
canteen
work
she
had
the
fleeting
idea
that
the
boy
must
be
on
his
way
back
to
bernard
hospital
she
probably
would
never
have
thought
of
him
again
had
not
something
rather
peculiar
happened
the
sailor
stood
just
in
line
of
her
vision
on
the
crowded
bus
the
man
next
to
him
had
been
smoking
a
cigar
when
he
came
aboard
and
now
held
it
in
his
hand
suddenly
as
the
bus
lurched
around
a
corner
ashes
from
the
end
of
the
cigar
fell
on
the
sailor
s
shoe
instantly
a
spurt
of
flame
ran
diagonally
across
the
boy
s
shoe
as
if
some
inflammable
liquid
had
been
spilled
on
it
hastily
the
sailor
stamped
out
the
flame
with
his
other
foot
it
all
happened
and
was
over
in
a
flash
kitty
was
impressed
enough
by
the
incident
however
to
notice
that
the
young
man
got
off
the
bus
at
the
hospital
station
even
then
she
would
probably
have
forgotten
the
incident
but
for
the
strange
events
of
the
following
day
she
was
roused
at
dawn
by
the
telephone
it
was
evans
chairman
of
the
island
canteen
unit
there
was
a
big
fire
over
at
the
oyster
cannery
last
night
she
told
kitty
practically
every
shack
on
the
point
was
burned
oh
how
terrible
can
i
do
anything
kitty
knew
that
the
oyster
cannery
district
was
the
poorest
housed
section
of
town
indeed
there
is
we
need
every
canteen
worker
we
can
get
to
help
prepare
for
these
homeless
i
ll
be
right
down
said
kitty
promptly
could
we
use
your
launch
oh
yes
i
m
sure
dad
won
t
illustration
spurt
of
flame
ran
across
the
boy
s
we
are
already
loading
the
station
wagon
but
that
won
t
hold
all
we
need
miss
pearson
phoned
from
bayport
for
us
to
bring
dishes
equipment
and
all
the
help
we
can
i
ll
be
down
as
soon
as
i
can
put
on
my
clothes
kitty
promised
how
thankful
she
was
that
they
had
arranged
for
jane
to
have
the
small
room
behind
the
kitchen
kitty
roused
her
and
gave
careful
instructions
about
the
house
and
billy
in
case
she
would
have
to
be
gone
all
day
then
she
told
her
father
about
the
call
and
in
ten
minutes
was
on
her
way
down
to
the
canteen
she
helped
vera
finish
loading
the
station
wagon
and
they
drove
over
to
the
dock
where
her
boat
was
housed
with
the
aid
of
sally
and
lana
they
filled
the
boat
with
pots
pans
all
sorts
of
utensils
and
dishes
and
what
canned
goods
they
had
in
stock
so
many
willing
hands
made
quick
work
of
the
packing
they
left
only
room
enough
for
evans
the
two
bright
girls
and
kitty
judy
conner
was
going
to
help
vera
pack
the
rest
of
their
things
in
the
station
wagon
and
drive
around
over
the
causeway
not
until
they
were
seated
in
the
boat
and
on
their
way
to
bayport
did
kitty
find
time
to
ask
about
the
fire
the
old
cannery
was
a
regular
firetrap
anyhow
said
sally
it
s
a
miracle
the
fire
didn
t
sweep
on
to
the
shipyards
evans
remarked
there
was
a
strong
northeast
wind
blowing
that
carried
burning
brands
right
in
that
sounds
like
sabotage
put
in
lana
i
doubt
it
said
evans
who
had
a
way
of
thinking
the
best
of
everything
and
everybody
a
careless
match
or
hot
cigarette
ashes
could
have
started
the
fire
in
any
of
those
the
mention
of
cigarette
ashes
made
kitty
think
of
the
cigar
ash
falling
on
the
sailor
s
shoe
in
the
bus
then
with
a
feeling
of
shock
she
recalled
that
the
sailor
had
come
aboard
the
bus
in
the
oyster
cannery
district
could
there
possibly
be
any
connection
between
the
two
fires
she
knew
that
gasoline
or
kerosene
was
often
used
by
saboteurs
in
setting
fires
perhaps
the
main
motive
had
not
been
the
destruction
of
the
cannery
and
shacks
but
the
shipyards
and
government
docks
beyond
resolutely
she
tried
to
dismiss
the
entire
affair
thinking
how
unjust
it
was
to
be
suspicious
of
people
she
didn
t
know
at
least
she
would
say
nothing
about
it
to
anyone
else
but
she
decided
to
do
some
investigating
on
her
own
if
opportunity
came
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
on
reaching
the
scene
of
the
disaster
however
that
for
a
time
kitty
forgot
all
about
the
incident
on
the
bus
the
bayport
canteen
workers
had
already
set
up
a
kitchen
in
a
small
playground
near
the
center
of
the
oyster
cannery
district
she
was
amazed
at
the
devastation
that
had
been
wrought
in
a
few
short
hours
practically
every
home
that
had
surrounded
the
oyster
cannery
and
docks
had
been
burned
to
charcoal
the
firemen
seeing
it
was
impossible
to
save
the
poorly
built
shacks
in
the
strong
gale
had
concentrated
on
preventing
the
spread
of
the
fire
to
the
essential
war
industries
near
by
it
may
be
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
these
people
said
miss
pearson
when
the
island
group
of
workers
arrived
we
ll
see
that
proper
housing
units
surround
the
cannery
if
it
is
kitty
had
her
initiation
that
day
in
the
wonderful
work
which
the
red
cross
does
in
emergencies
as
there
was
no
adequate
kitchen
within
easy
reach
of
the
homeless
people
cooking
racks
had
been
set
up
in
the
open
if
this
were
night
and
there
was
danger
of
air
raids
miss
pearson
explained
to
a
group
of
canteen
apprentices
who
stood
around
the
cook
fire
we
d
have
to
cover
our
cook
fire
completely
to
keep
it
from
being
seen
my
brother
in
the
coast
guard
says
even
a
match
struck
in
the
marshes
can
be
seen
by
a
passing
plane
sally
told
them
soon
pots
were
steaming
with
coffee
while
huge
saucepans
held
bubbling
cereal
kitty
with
three
other
girls
improvised
a
table
and
benches
where
the
children
could
sit
to
eat
in
her
group
was
janice
a
member
of
the
nutrition
class
whom
vera
had
pointed
out
as
a
resident
of
the
cannery
district
she
was
an
uneducated
woman
with
an
eager
willingness
to
do
everything
in
her
power
to
help
three
of
her
sons
were
in
the
service
though
she
and
her
other
two
children
were
now
left
homeless
she
was
doing
her
bit
to
help
her
fellow
sufferers
there
s
talk
that
the
cannery
was
set
afire
she
told
kitty
when
they
went
off
together
to
tear
some
loose
planks
from
a
small
section
of
the
cannery
that
had
not
burned
really
what
have
you
heard
about
it
kitty
said
encouraging
janice
to
talk
the
night
watchman
said
he
saw
a
stranger
in
dark
clothes
hurrying
past
the
factory
not
ten
minutes
before
he
discovered
the
then
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
a
sailor
too
he
could
it
be
possible
that
the
boy
she
had
seen
on
the
bus
had
done
this
awful
thing
but
kitty
tried
not
to
show
her
suspicions
as
she
said
but
people
must
constantly
pass
by
the
that
s
so
of
course
but
you
know
how
it
is
you
hear
all
sorts
o
talk
people
round
here
were
mighty
careful
bout
fire
knowing
how
shoddy
our
houses
maybe
it
s
a
blessing
in
disguise
you
ll
certainly
have
better
homes
to
live
in
after
with
the
aid
of
janice
s
son
jerry
they
found
a
half
dozen
boards
from
which
they
managed
to
make
a
table
the
canteen
workers
were
soon
helping
the
hungry
children
to
bowls
of
hot
cereal
and
milk
as
they
lined
up
at
the
table
some
of
them
were
upset
at
being
separated
from
their
parents
but
kitty
had
a
way
of
stilling
their
fears
as
she
satisfied
their
hunger
when
their
breakfast
was
over
kitty
gave
each
of
them
an
apple
and
herded
them
over
near
the
swings
she
solicited
the
aid
of
some
older
boys
and
girls
to
keep
the
younger
children
amused
while
their
parents
ate
then
for
two
hours
she
helped
wash
the
pile
of
dishes
how
long
will
we
have
to
feed
them
she
asked
evans
when
she
was
finally
drying
her
hands
tired
already
oh
is
of
course
i
m
tired
but
i
didn
t
mean
it
that
way
i
was
just
wondering
what
s
to
be
done
about
all
these
people
where
will
they
sleep
tonight
what
will
they
do
till
more
homes
can
be
built
and
well
you
may
my
dear
said
evans
kindly
the
town
is
packed
to
capacity
with
war
workers
in
spite
of
that
many
homes
have
already
made
room
for
some
of
these
people
the
red
cross
will
provide
tents
for
others
until
permanent
shelter
can
be
found
in
the
meantime
they
are
dependent
on
the
canteen
corps
for
kitty
s
eyes
were
starry
as
she
looked
at
her
leader
it
s
wonderful
work
isn
t
it
evans
indeed
it
is
if
this
fire
was
the
work
of
saboteurs
it
only
makes
us
dedicate
ourselves
all
the
more
devotedly
to
bringing
peace
and
harmony
in
the
sometimes
the
most
loyal
person
can
let
carelessness
make
him
the
worst
sort
of
saboteur
said
evans
significantly
kitty
thought
she
had
more
reason
than
anyone
else
for
doubting
that
that
fire
had
been
started
by
a
careless
patriot
she
had
thought
at
first
that
she
would
keep
quiet
about
the
little
incident
on
the
bus
last
night
but
now
she
made
up
her
mind
to
take
brad
mason
into
her
confidence
brad
might
be
in
a
position
to
make
some
investigations
that
she
could
not
about
the
sailor
chapter
five
the
snack
bar
nutrition
classes
were
suspended
for
the
duration
of
the
emergency
you
ll
learn
more
through
actual
experience
now
miss
pearson
told
them
than
i
could
teach
you
in
many
kitty
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
during
the
next
three
days
helping
to
feed
the
homeless
cannery
workers
and
their
families
tuesday
evening
she
was
much
too
weary
to
go
to
the
regular
uso
party
and
so
she
had
no
opportunity
to
see
brad
till
the
following
saturday
by
that
time
her
excitement
over
the
fire
had
cooled
and
she
was
afraid
he
would
think
her
silly
to
accuse
the
strange
sailor
of
having
anything
to
do
with
it
a
score
of
times
she
had
heard
her
father
say
when
in
doubt
say
so
she
wisely
followed
his
advice
there
was
so
much
work
to
be
done
in
the
closing
days
of
the
nutrition
class
that
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
anything
else
the
course
had
opened
up
to
her
a
whole
new
world
of
practical
interest
i
can
t
believe
we
ve
learned
so
much
in
two
weeks
she
said
to
lana
and
vera
i
m
surely
glad
miss
pearson
taught
us
every
day
instead
of
once
a
week
as
they
do
in
some
places
said
vera
i
ll
say
agreed
lana
it
s
much
better
to
do
it
in
two
weeks
instead
of
and
it
s
been
so
much
fun
too
said
kitty
only
think
of
the
places
we
ve
plants
canneries
bakeries
restaurant
kitchens
it
s
so
interesting
to
learn
about
all
the
food
industries
around
this
part
of
the
i
ve
got
a
whole
notebook
full
of
recipes
and
ideas
about
food
i
can
put
to
good
use
when
my
jim
comes
back
from
italy
said
vera
huh
laughed
kitty
i
don
t
have
to
wait
for
anybody
to
come
lana
laughed
too
that
s
right
you
have
a
dad
and
little
brother
to
experiment
on
right
on
the
last
evening
as
they
were
going
over
to
class
kitty
said
to
her
two
pals
strange
but
i
don
t
feel
a
bit
nervous
over
the
it
s
been
so
practical
and
interesting
there
s
no
sense
in
anyone
being
nervous
vera
agreed
i
wish
i
felt
as
certain
as
you
two
said
lana
who
was
still
poring
over
her
tables
of
vitamins
and
caloric
values
at
this
final
meeting
all
except
three
members
of
the
class
signed
up
to
go
on
with
the
canteen
work
though
kitty
and
her
two
friends
were
the
only
ones
from
palmetto
island
kitty
felt
a
real
glow
of
pride
when
she
received
her
certificate
at
the
conclusion
of
the
course
each
member
of
the
class
was
also
given
a
recipe
book
to
help
with
her
own
home
menus
the
canteen
course
that
followed
immediately
under
evans
gave
quite
a
different
kind
of
instruction
the
brief
experience
they
had
already
had
in
emergency
feeding
made
them
keenly
appreciative
of
all
the
phases
of
the
canteen
instruction
step
by
step
they
discussed
all
the
angles
of
the
work
planning
menus
for
large
scale
feeding
food
preparation
and
here
the
course
they
had
just
taken
was
of
invaluable
aid
they
also
discussed
methods
of
food
service
and
how
to
keep
a
canteen
orderly
and
spotless
kitty
was
one
of
the
group
who
received
some
practical
experience
in
serving
food
at
the
blood
donation
center
twice
a
week
two
days
before
this
course
ended
there
was
a
railroad
wreck
miles
from
town
kitty
went
with
the
mobile
canteen
to
supply
food
for
the
rescue
crew
who
were
working
to
clear
the
wounded
from
the
wreck
it
happened
to
be
hazel
dawson
s
day
off
and
she
too
went
in
the
red
cross
station
wagon
and
worked
like
a
trooper
giving
first
aid
to
the
wounded
tired
asked
hazel
gently
as
they
were
riding
home
in
the
red
cross
car
at
ten
o
clock
that
night
i
didn
t
know
i
was
tired
till
i
sat
down
kitty
admitted
but
hazel
isn
t
it
wonderful
to
be
able
to
help
people
at
a
time
like
this
there
s
nothing
in
life
quite
so
wonderful
you
have
the
spirit
of
a
real
canteen
worker
kitty
it
s
a
privilege
to
feed
men
s
bodies
when
they
re
hungry
but
it
s
still
more
wonderful
to
give
comfort
to
their
souls
and
anxious
minds
as
i
saw
you
doing
several
times
kitty
had
had
no
greater
sense
of
pride
when
she
donned
her
cap
and
gown
at
graduation
than
she
felt
the
day
she
was
entitled
to
wear
her
canteen
uniform
the
first
time
she
was
going
over
to
bayport
to
meet
a
troop
train
with
several
of
the
workers
the
belgian
blue
poplin
dress
made
her
bright
eyes
seem
all
the
bluer
her
heart
was
beating
proudly
when
she
arranged
her
cap
behind
the
auburn
hair
rolled
softly
into
a
pompadour
she
had
a
feeling
of
real
pride
in
those
red
crosses
on
her
pocket
and
the
white
band
of
her
cap
some
day
she
meant
to
earn
service
bars
too
evans
wore
a
chevron
and
three
bars
representing
seven
years
of
service
although
the
girls
did
not
wear
their
uniforms
at
the
snack
bar
kitty
donned
the
official
apron
she
was
allowed
to
wear
there
on
the
first
evening
after
finishing
her
course
though
she
had
done
much
volunteer
work
at
the
bar
she
felt
somewhat
elated
tonight
over
being
a
canteen
worker
she
was
in
an
expansive
mood
and
said
as
she
and
judy
were
slicing
bread
for
sandwiches
let
s
make
em
extra
large
with
plenty
of
stuffing
just
to
celebrate
our
you
might
make
that
special
dressing
you
were
telling
me
about
judy
suggested
may
i
evans
kitty
asked
of
course
the
boys
always
enjoy
something
kitty
had
learned
to
make
a
tart
creole
sauce
for
sandwich
filling
from
their
cook
in
new
orleans
so
she
prepared
a
bowlful
by
the
time
the
boys
began
to
drift
into
the
hall
the
air
was
fragrant
with
coffee
and
chocolate
and
trays
of
sandwiches
were
ready
brad
knowing
it
was
kitty
s
initiation
night
was
one
of
the
first
bluejackets
to
plant
his
elbows
on
the
counter
and
demand
a
sandwich
and
a
cupa
cawfee
too
wench
and
be
snappy
about
it
he
said
with
mock
gruffness
she
made
a
face
at
him
as
she
turned
to
get
the
coffee
after
one
bite
of
the
sandwich
brad
s
eyes
bulged
oh
boy
this
tastes
like
something
from
toni
s
swanky
joint
in
new
kitty
laughed
in
delight
our
old
cook
used
to
work
at
toni
s
she
gave
me
lots
of
his
jimmy
barnes
sat
beside
brad
taking
huge
bites
of
a
sandwich
he
enthusiastically
added
his
praise
to
brad
s
boy
but
this
is
really
seasoned
up
like
home
about
the
best
seasoning
they
give
us
up
at
the
hospital
is
the
shrimp
and
they
only
have
that
about
twice
a
month
added
jimmy
in
disgust
kitty
s
curiosity
stirred
maybe
this
was
her
chance
to
learn
something
about
the
staff
in
the
galley
do
you
know
the
cooks
very
well
she
asked
only
a
passing
acquaintance
said
brad
our
chief
commissary
steward
is
named
old
timer
at
the
i
saw
a
thin
chap
on
the
bus
the
other
night
with
a
crescent
on
his
arm
do
you
happen
to
know
him
quite
a
number
down
there
said
jimmy
dubiously
only
one
i
ve
talked
to
very
often
is
a
fair
young
chap
named
ned
there
s
one
named
punaro
fits
your
description
brad
told
kitty
he
empties
wastebaskets
on
our
right
eighteen
or
nineteen
kitty
persisted
about
that
only
been
in
a
few
months
why
oh
nothing
i
just
happened
to
see
him
the
other
day
on
the
a
few
minutes
later
brad
and
jimmy
went
off
to
play
a
game
of
pingpong
with
some
of
the
girls
and
for
the
next
hour
kitty
was
very
busy
at
the
bar
later
during
a
lull
in
their
business
she
glanced
down
the
hall
and
noticed
that
lieutenant
cary
was
playing
chess
with
someone
in
the
south
corner
of
the
room
they
were
about
the
only
two
who
had
not
patronized
the
snack
bar
during
the
evening
what
s
so
interesting
over
there
brad
s
teasing
tone
jolted
kitty
out
of
her
curious
speculation
who
s
that
playing
chess
with
lieutenant
cary
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
brad
glanced
to
the
south
corner
of
the
room
and
replied
you
mean
the
head
cook
up
at
the
hospital
what
s
so
surprising
about
that
somehow
i
thought
lieutenant
cary
would
be
too
snippity
to
play
chess
with
the
why
krome
s
chief
commissary
steward
lieutenant
cary
has
no
reason
to
be
to
him
he
was
in
the
service
long
before
cary
ever
thought
of
such
a
is
that
so
but
cary
is
a
just
the
same
he
s
only
been
in
the
service
a
few
months
he
s
one
of
the
physicians
recently
oh
i
see
murmured
kitty
in
a
significant
tone
then
she
asked
do
you
know
anything
about
the
cook
illustration
what
s
so
interesting
there
brad
brad
laughed
i
know
he
can
dish
up
some
mighty
good
chow
on
he
looks
as
though
he
didn
t
object
to
good
eating
himself
he
must
weigh
two
hundred
and
at
kitty
tried
to
make
her
tone
seem
trivial
in
case
anyone
else
had
overheard
their
conversation
i
ll
be
trotting
along
brad
said
i
promised
to
make
a
fourth
for
bridge
over
kitty
held
his
eyes
a
moment
and
lowered
her
voice
to
say
there
s
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
when
i
have
a
i
ll
see
you
home
if
you
can
get
through
before
eleven
we
can
talk
on
the
way
fine
she
agreed
brad
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
with
the
other
players
when
lieutenant
cary
and
chief
krome
came
toward
the
bar
excitedly
kitty
whispered
to
judy
let
me
wait
on
them
if
they
come
judy
sent
her
a
surprised
look
you
re
welcome
to
them
i
wouldn
t
be
neither
am
i
in
the
way
you
think
retorted
kitty
with
a
laugh
she
thought
what
an
odd
pair
they
made
as
they
came
toward
the
snack
bar
lieutenant
cary
was
as
lean
and
alert
as
a
bloodhound
while
the
krome
was
almost
a
head
shorter
kitty
would
have
felt
curious
about
any
man
who
was
friendly
with
lieutenant
cary
even
if
her
curiosity
had
not
already
been
stirred
by
one
of
krome
s
assistants
so
that
the
association
brought
the
chief
steward
under
suspicion
also
vera
came
out
of
the
kitchen
just
as
the
two
men
straddled
the
stools
at
the
counter
and
she
took
lieutenant
cary
s
order
kitty
s
hand
was
a
little
unsteady
as
she
poured
krome
s
cup
of
coffee
we
have
some
special
sandwiches
tonight
judy
explained
to
the
two
customers
made
by
our
new
canteen
worker
miss
kitty
i
ll
take
two
krome
spoke
up
promptly
when
kitty
faced
the
head
cook
squarely
he
seemed
such
a
hearty
sort
her
suspicions
evaporated
like
the
steam
above
his
coffee
cup
so
you
re
now
a
canteen
though
lieutenant
cary
s
smile
and
words
were
friendly
enough
his
tone
held
a
slight
cynicism
i
wasn
t
a
bit
prouder
when
i
donned
my
cap
and
gown
at
graduation
from
college
than
when
i
put
on
my
uniform
the
first
time
she
said
frankly
they
got
something
when
they
got
you
young
lady
spoke
up
krome
warmly
these
sandwiches
ain
t
to
be
sneezed
why
i
m
thrilled
that
you
think
so
they
tell
me
you
can
serve
some
very
good
things
over
at
the
hospital
and
i
can
vouch
for
it
myself
the
few
times
i
ve
eaten
so
you
re
chief
carter
s
daughter
and
proud
i
am
to
have
the
krome
finished
the
last
crumb
of
his
sandwich
and
said
how
about
giving
me
the
recipe
for
that
sandwich
filling
kitty
looked
disconcerted
if
you
feed
the
boys
on
it
at
the
hospital
they
may
not
want
our
sandwiches
down
i
ll
promise
not
to
do
kitty
laughed
oh
really
i
wouldn
t
be
that
selfish
you
re
welcome
to
the
recipe
and
maybe
you
d
do
me
a
favor
in
krome
looked
surprised
me
do
you
a
favor
he
asked
indicating
himself
then
kitty
with
his
fat
hand
then
he
laughed
as
if
it
were
a
great
joke
i
heard
the
boys
talking
about
your
grand
shrimp
that
they
don
t
get
it
often
enough
how
about
giving
me
that
recipe
oh
that
sure
we
ll
swap
recipes
then
i
ll
bring
it
next
time
i
when
the
men
had
gone
judy
said
with
a
sniff
if
you
ever
get
a
recipe
out
of
him
you
ll
do
better
than
evans
has
he
s
promised
her
several
and
never
brought
maybe
he
ll
pay
more
attention
to
my
request
if
he
wants
a
recipe
from
at
when
kitty
put
on
her
light
wrap
to
go
home
she
was
really
tired
but
how
glowingly
happy
she
felt
at
the
realization
that
her
job
had
been
well
done
brad
was
waiting
for
her
though
it
was
only
march
there
was
more
than
a
hint
of
spring
in
the
balmy
night
air
and
the
stars
seemed
close
and
warm
in
a
sky
like
deep
purple
porcelain
neither
of
them
spoke
while
they
walked
the
first
block
then
brad
said
you
wanted
to
ask
me
about
something
yes
i
did
but
somehow
it
seems
absurd
to
be
suspicious
of
anyone
on
a
night
like
well
forget
after
an
interval
he
asked
think
you
re
going
to
enjoy
the
canteen
work
i
m
crazy
about
it
but
really
it
seems
so
little
to
do
when
there
s
so
much
to
be
it
s
all
the
little
bits
put
together
that
s
going
to
help
us
win
this
and
prepare
us
to
live
in
a
more
wonderful
peace
afterward
it
s
learning
to
work
together
that
s
so
one
person
pulling
in
the
wrong
direction
can
upset
the
whole
kitty
made
no
reply
but
she
thought
he
must
know
what
was
on
her
mind
even
before
he
added
i
figure
you
ve
been
wondering
why
krome
and
cary
seem
so
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
we
ve
both
put
a
big
question
mark
behind
cary
and
when
we
see
krome
buddying
with
him
he
gets
a
question
mark
not
only
that
chap
punaro
you
were
asking
about
what
s
he
done
i
ve
hesitated
a
long
time
about
mentioning
it
it
may
seem
i
m
straining
at
a
let
s
have
it
he
urged
you
do
hate
to
suspect
people
of
being
spies
and
saboteurs
especially
when
they
re
right
in
the
hospital
with
your
own
all
the
more
reason
you
shouldn
t
take
any
quickly
kitty
gave
brad
an
account
of
the
little
incident
on
the
bus
three
weeks
earlier
it
seems
sort
of
absurd
now
that
i
m
talking
about
it
for
the
first
time
to
think
the
boy
might
have
had
anything
to
do
with
the
fire
at
the
oyster
cannery
but
that
s
exactly
what
i
have
been
i
don
t
think
your
suspicions
are
if
he
used
gasoline
or
kerosene
to
start
that
fire
it
was
still
fresh
enough
to
flame
up
from
those
cigar
ashes
and
he
certainly
did
get
on
the
bus
right
at
the
cannery
if
that
fire
was
the
work
of
saboteurs
the
objective
was
no
doubt
the
shipyards
not
the
they
walked
on
to
kitty
s
door
in
silence
then
brad
said
i
sure
wish
you
d
told
me
about
this
when
it
why
i
can
t
see
that
we
can
do
maybe
i
could
have
managed
to
get
a
squint
at
punaro
s
punaro
s
shoes
but
the
gasoline
or
whatever
it
was
had
already
burned
but
shell
dust
would
still
have
been
on
the
soles
next
s
so
i
hadn
t
thought
of
you
know
all
that
land
around
the
cannery
has
been
built
up
of
oyster
shells
explained
brad
it
was
once
only
a
marshy
bog
they
tell
me
if
punaro
set
that
fire
he
d
be
obliged
to
get
shell
dust
on
his
the
only
paved
sidewalk
runs
along
the
street
where
the
bus
stopped
explained
kitty
i
noticed
that
the
day
we
went
over
to
open
the
there
s
a
possibility
i
might
still
find
out
how
he
probably
stopped
wearing
those
shoes
with
the
burned
stain
if
he
discarded
them
right
away
they
d
probably
still
bear
the
evidence
of
shell
and
even
if
you
found
out
he
d
really
been
there
brad
where
would
it
take
us
i
don
t
know
but
you
can
just
be
sure
kit
i
m
not
going
to
let
a
thing
like
this
slide
chapter
six
a
revelation
kitty
was
still
thinking
of
her
conversation
with
brad
when
she
went
in
to
help
jane
with
breakfast
the
next
morning
what
could
they
do
about
it
even
if
they
had
positive
proof
that
the
punaro
boy
had
visited
the
oyster
cannery
on
the
night
of
the
fire
he
could
claim
he
had
gone
there
to
see
friends
and
they
would
have
accomplished
nothing
by
their
prying
she
hoped
brad
wouldn
t
get
in
any
trouble
about
it
how
did
you
like
your
canteen
work
her
father
asked
at
breakfast
oh
fine
she
exclaimed
her
thoughts
returning
to
the
real
work
of
the
previous
evening
it
s
really
loads
of
fun
i
m
going
to
be
on
duty
every
other
you
ll
be
doing
more
than
your
quota
of
hours
won
t
you
oh
i
don
t
mind
that
this
is
no
time
to
stick
to
quotas
you
you
spoke
a
truth
then
kitten
her
father
said
proudly
we
have
so
few
workers
over
here
on
the
island
each
of
us
will
have
to
do
double
duty
it
s
going
to
be
loads
of
i
m
so
pleased
you
ve
found
your
place
in
the
war
program
i
was
sure
you
kitty
glanced
at
her
father
gratefully
as
she
handed
him
the
hot
muffins
jane
had
brought
in
no
thanks
i
have
but
dad
you
always
eat
two
and
you
haven
t
eaten
half
your
eggs
that
s
very
unpatriotic
with
eggs
so
he
laughed
i
m
beginning
to
see
the
effects
of
your
nutrition
course
i
ll
admit
it
s
made
me
food
conscious
and
i
was
already
point
i
must
hand
it
to
you
women
for
having
a
streak
of
genius
with
handling
rationing
i
m
ashamed
to
admit
it
dad
but
i
find
myself
figuring
up
point
values
first
and
almost
forgetting
what
a
thing
is
going
to
i
ve
had
a
few
worries
myself
over
supplies
he
said
and
kitty
saw
the
furrow
deepen
between
his
brows
how
s
that
dad
she
asked
eagerly
hoping
he
would
open
up
about
what
was
on
his
mind
oh
you
have
problems
enough
without
being
burdened
with
mine
he
said
kitty
ate
the
last
half
of
her
muffin
with
some
honey
then
she
sat
looking
thoughtfully
at
her
father
she
had
been
so
absorbed
in
her
own
activities
lately
she
had
paid
scant
heed
to
his
failing
appetite
now
she
realized
he
had
eaten
very
little
for
several
days
dad
don
t
you
think
you
d
better
take
a
tonic
or
something
she
said
finally
your
appetite
is
just
about
he
tried
to
laugh
off
her
anxiety
oh
i
ll
pick
up
in
a
day
or
so
i
ve
been
rather
preoccupied
with
things
at
the
his
admission
gave
her
a
start
anything
wrong
nothing
that
can
t
be
adjusted
in
time
i
you
couldn
t
tell
me
about
it
no
sense
in
burdening
you
with
my
problems
kitty
you
have
enough
on
your
shoulders
maybe
i
could
help
sometimes
problems
clear
up
after
talking
them
over
with
others
every
time
i
ve
ever
brought
my
troubles
to
you
they
seem
to
vanish
in
thin
there
re
some
things
a
man
can
t
talk
over
with
anyone
kitten
when
he
s
in
the
service
he
has
to
keep
things
from
even
his
own
daughter
whom
he
d
trust
with
his
very
kitty
was
now
certain
that
there
was
something
radically
wrong
was
it
possible
that
it
could
in
any
way
be
connected
with
the
clues
she
had
picked
up
in
the
last
few
weeks
willard
dawson
chief
pharmacist
s
mate
who
had
just
preceded
him
had
been
involved
in
some
sort
of
trouble
at
the
hospital
was
her
father
becoming
involved
in
the
same
sort
of
complications
the
idea
that
he
also
might
be
relegated
to
some
remote
base
filled
kitty
with
terror
the
life
they
were
living
here
together
seemed
a
paradise
when
she
feared
that
something
tragic
might
happen
to
end
it
after
her
father
had
gone
to
the
hospital
kitty
couldn
t
put
him
from
her
mind
she
decided
she
must
do
something
to
lift
him
out
of
his
depression
later
when
she
was
in
the
kitchen
helping
to
fix
billy
s
breakfast
plate
she
remarked
to
jane
that
she
was
afraid
her
father
wasn
t
very
well
reckon
he
worried
bout
somepen
miss
kit
why
what
makes
you
think
that
las
night
atter
us
all
in
bed
i
hear
him
pacin
back
an
fo
th
back
an
fo
th
like
somepen
whut
s
somepen
whut
s
trapped
kept
ringing
in
kitty
s
head
after
she
left
the
kitchen
this
morning
she
felt
like
someone
who
had
picked
up
half
a
dozen
pieces
of
a
puzzle
out
of
which
she
could
make
no
sense
at
all
if
she
had
had
any
idea
of
what
was
back
of
it
all
she
might
have
pieced
them
together
in
an
orderly
pattern
later
as
she
gathered
fresh
nasturtiums
from
the
little
flower
bed
under
the
window
the
vision
of
lieutenant
cary
and
chief
krome
playing
chess
rose
up
to
trouble
her
surely
they
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
father
s
anxieties
yet
she
could
not
forget
the
mutual
antagonism
which
cary
and
hazel
had
shown
each
other
instantly
and
she
felt
instinctively
that
they
were
all
involved
in
a
strange
chess
game
which
she
had
to
play
blindfolded
but
she
was
determined
if
her
alertness
could
prevent
it
that
her
father
would
never
become
a
pawn
to
be
sacrificed
as
willard
dawson
had
been
suddenly
she
had
a
sense
of
guilt
that
she
had
given
her
father
so
little
companionship
lately
then
she
thought
of
nurse
dawson
and
something
he
had
said
when
she
first
arrived
we
must
have
her
over
to
dinner
some
evening
it
means
so
much
to
people
in
the
service
to
go
into
real
why
not
have
her
over
tonight
she
thought
she
had
an
evening
free
of
canteen
work
and
dad
definitely
needed
cheering
up
she
hurried
to
her
desk
drawer
to
study
her
ration
books
to
see
if
there
were
enough
points
left
for
a
decent
roast
since
dad
had
been
eating
two
meals
at
home
he
also
had
books
which
helped
out
greatly
and
with
jane
s
books
added
she
had
much
more
latitude
in
her
buying
her
father
had
just
reached
his
office
when
kitty
got
him
on
the
phone
she
made
her
tone
as
sprightly
as
possible
when
she
asked
dad
how
about
having
hazel
over
to
dinner
tonight
his
voice
had
an
eager
quality
when
he
answered
oh
fine
kitten
it
wouldn
t
be
too
much
bother
illustration
how
about
asking
hazel
over
tonight
no
indeed
i
ve
been
wanting
to
for
a
long
time
and
this
evening
i
haven
t
another
thing
to
do
will
you
ask
her
maybe
you
d
better
phone
her
i
won
t
have
an
opportunity
to
see
her
till
lunch
and
by
that
time
she
may
have
made
other
old
dear
just
as
you
tell
her
i
ll
call
for
her
at
kitty
thought
as
she
dialed
the
hospital
that
her
father
had
let
slip
an
important
point
in
mentioning
that
he
wouldn
t
see
hazel
till
noon
he
implied
that
they
must
eat
together
every
day
the
thought
made
her
feel
very
happy
when
kitty
finally
got
in
touch
with
hazel
and
gave
her
the
invitation
she
eagerly
accepted
is
she
comin
jane
wanted
to
know
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
awaiting
the
answer
she
and
dad
were
as
pleased
as
two
kids
being
invited
to
a
picnic
we
ll
have
to
give
them
a
swell
feed
jane
and
see
if
this
improves
his
kitty
dashed
off
to
the
market
to
see
what
she
could
get
for
their
dinner
she
did
a
weekly
shopping
in
bayport
on
saturdays
in
order
to
save
gasoline
she
tried
to
manage
the
rest
of
the
time
with
what
she
could
pick
up
on
the
island
it
proved
to
be
a
busy
day
for
both
her
and
jane
while
the
negro
girl
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
kitty
tried
to
brighten
up
the
rather
shabby
furnishings
of
their
little
cottage
she
reminded
herself
that
it
was
wartime
and
one
must
make
the
best
of
undesirable
living
conditions
they
had
brought
their
own
silver
and
linens
from
their
old
home
on
the
gulf
coast
and
with
these
she
made
the
table
look
very
pretty
the
bowl
of
nasturtiums
in
the
center
gave
quite
a
festive
air
ain
t
no
use
to
worry
bout
de
looks
miss
kit
jane
consoled
her
when
she
arranged
and
the
flowers
to
get
the
right
effect
us
make
de
grub
taste
good
enough
an
dey
won
t
think
bout
nothin
else
dese
ain
t
no
times
to
worry
bout
de
frills
o
livin
kitty
had
often
thought
that
jane
with
a
little
more
education
would
have
made
a
fine
philosopher
certainly
she
would
never
die
of
worrying
over
what
couldn
t
be
helped
kitty
wore
sweater
suits
so
constantly
she
felt
really
dressed
up
when
she
put
on
one
of
her
old
silk
prints
and
let
her
hair
down
from
its
tight
ringlets
to
fall
in
soft
auburn
curls
about
her
face
it
seemed
to
belong
that
way
with
the
flowered
print
though
kitty
had
intended
cultivating
hazel
dawson
s
acquaintance
she
had
actually
been
with
her
only
once
since
her
arrival
then
she
and
her
father
and
hazel
had
eaten
lunch
together
in
the
hospital
where
there
was
little
chance
for
connected
conversation
so
kitty
was
also
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
develop
their
friendship
hazel
couldn
t
praise
kitty
s
delicious
dinner
enough
and
remarked
several
times
how
wonderful
it
was
to
be
in
a
real
home
it
s
nothing
like
the
lovely
bungalow
we
had
in
new
orleans
said
kitty
of
course
we
had
our
own
things
there
but
i
m
not
complaining
it
s
too
wonderful
that
we
can
be
together
in
any
sort
of
home
after
a
while
kitty
slipped
into
the
background
and
listened
while
her
father
and
hazel
discussed
other
places
they
had
worked
and
mutual
friends
who
were
now
scattered
far
and
wide
the
meal
was
not
half
over
before
kitty
was
certain
her
father
had
more
than
a
passing
interest
in
this
nurse
his
preoccupation
of
the
morning
had
vanished
with
the
genial
companionship
i
m
hoping
i
ll
get
a
chance
at
overseas
duty
again
said
hazel
you
wouldn
t
want
to
go
till
you
finish
the
job
you
came
here
to
oh
no
no
indeed
i
wouldn
t
be
satisfied
to
go
anywhere
till
that
s
kitty
glanced
speculatively
from
one
to
the
other
their
words
implied
much
when
hazel
looked
across
the
table
to
find
a
puzzled
expression
on
kitty
s
face
she
instantly
changed
the
subject
don
t
forget
my
dear
that
you
promised
to
take
me
on
a
tour
of
these
inland
i
haven
t
forgotten
but
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
while
i
was
taking
my
canteen
i
m
so
interested
in
this
coast
country
it
s
really
in
a
week
or
so
the
weather
will
be
getting
very
mild
then
we
ll
make
a
day
of
it
when
you
have
some
time
off
kitty
promised
after
dinner
kitty
excused
herself
to
see
about
billy
who
had
eaten
earlier
and
been
put
to
bed
as
she
went
down
the
hall
she
heard
hazel
say
to
her
father
i
ve
been
wanting
to
tell
you
something
i
have
just
then
for
the
first
time
kitty
felt
certain
that
hazel
dawson
had
come
to
the
bernard
hospital
in
the
double
capacity
of
nurse
and
investigator
in
behalf
of
her
brother
in
order
to
give
them
plenty
of
time
for
consultation
she
stayed
in
billy
s
room
an
hour
reading
him
bedtime
stories
his
sleepy
eyes
had
been
closed
some
time
when
her
father
poked
his
head
in
the
doorway
and
asked
kitten
aren
t
you
coming
back
to
the
she
tried
to
smile
disarmingly
as
she
said
softly
billy
felt
sort
of
out
of
it
all
i
had
to
make
it
up
to
i
want
you
to
sing
for
hazel
he
added
as
they
went
down
the
hall
oh
please
do
exclaimed
hazel
who
overheard
them
i
ve
always
wanted
to
hear
you
this
old
piano
is
terribly
out
of
tune
and
i
m
out
of
practice
but
i
ll
she
sang
a
simple
little
lullaby
first
and
gaining
courage
from
their
praise
she
sang
the
aria
she
had
learned
for
her
closing
recital
at
school
oh
kitty
darling
your
voice
is
really
beautiful
so
full
and
rich
you
go
on
with
your
music
all
the
world
ought
to
be
hearing
that
beautiful
hazel
s
words
once
more
stirred
kitty
s
old
ambition
that
had
been
overshadowed
of
late
by
circumstances
when
the
war
is
over
maybe
she
tried
to
speak
with
an
indifference
she
did
not
feel
but
right
now
i
have
other
jobs
to
haven
t
we
all
said
hazel
significantly
and
turned
to
meet
her
friend
s
understanding
glance
later
when
her
father
had
gone
to
take
hazel
home
kitty
sat
at
the
window
a
long
time
she
felt
an
unaccountable
loneliness
even
while
her
heart
rejoiced
at
what
the
evening
had
revealed
what
a
wonderful
wife
hazel
would
make
for
her
dad
his
loneliness
had
long
been
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
her
finally
she
went
to
her
room
humming
softly
the
lullaby
hoping
that
those
suspicions
at
least
had
good
foundation
maybe
some
day
after
the
war
she
would
have
a
home
of
her
own
what
a
comfort
it
would
be
to
know
dad
was
not
left
alone
chapter
seven
the
tangled
web
a
wild
march
gale
was
howling
over
the
island
the
following
evening
though
rain
poured
in
torrents
kitty
found
a
score
of
marines
and
sailors
already
in
the
uso
hall
when
she
arrived
at
the
snack
bar
on
such
nights
she
always
thought
of
the
boys
across
the
water
who
were
fighting
in
all
sorts
of
weather
the
snack
bar
and
the
cozy
atmosphere
of
the
big
hall
made
her
wish
they
could
all
share
this
comfort
nell
cruger
the
uso
hostess
was
worried
when
she
remarked
to
kitty
vera
just
phoned
from
out
at
thompsons
place
that
she
s
stuck
in
the
mud
but
will
get
here
as
soon
as
she
can
we
haven
t
half
enough
girls
to
keep
the
boys
entertained
till
oh
depend
on
vera
to
get
out
of
any
sort
of
tight
spot
replied
kitty
confidently
she
ll
be
along
after
a
while
with
a
station
wagon
full
of
kitty
had
her
own
canteen
duties
to
look
after
and
was
quite
busy
for
half
an
hour
before
she
realized
that
vera
had
not
yet
arrived
only
one
carful
of
girls
had
come
in
and
although
they
were
doing
their
best
to
make
the
boys
have
a
pleasant
evening
there
was
still
not
nearly
enough
girls
kitty
decided
the
canteen
girls
would
have
to
do
double
duty
by
helping
the
uso
hostess
she
was
about
to
tell
evans
she
would
go
outside
into
the
hall
to
be
some
boy
s
partner
for
a
dance
when
she
noticed
a
fellow
at
her
own
snack
bar
she
had
served
him
a
cup
of
coffee
when
he
first
came
in
and
had
made
overtures
of
friendship
which
had
been
indifferently
received
he
still
sat
on
the
end
stool
looking
dejectedly
into
space
half
his
coffee
still
in
the
cup
anything
else
you
d
like
she
asked
no
thanks
he
replied
without
changing
his
position
or
looking
toward
her
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
a
moment
later
to
get
some
more
cream
and
sally
elbow
deep
in
suds
said
poor
boy
he
s
been
sitting
there
in
a
fog
for
the
last
half
hour
guess
he
s
got
something
rather
bothersome
on
his
he
looks
like
a
new
one
in
the
service
commented
kitty
later
as
she
wiped
the
counter
clean
she
noticed
the
sailor
s
fresh
fair
complexion
not
yet
tanned
by
the
southern
sun
there
was
something
about
him
that
made
her
think
of
billy
her
own
little
brother
might
look
like
that
when
he
was
grown
up
in
twenty
years
she
hoped
there
wouldn
t
be
another
war
to
catch
him
in
its
snares
if
it
had
to
happen
she
knew
she
would
thank
any
canteen
worker
who
would
cheer
him
she
pushed
a
neatly
wrapped
sandwich
toward
the
sailor
these
sandwiches
are
really
good
she
said
encouragingly
wouldn
t
you
like
to
try
one
then
he
turned
slightly
and
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
i
couldn
t
swallow
a
bite
he
said
his
gentle
gray
eyes
were
as
pathetic
as
a
frightened
lamb
s
kitty
couldn
t
bear
it
she
darted
back
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
evans
about
him
he
s
been
sitting
there
utterly
dejected
for
the
last
half
he
s
ned
miller
explained
sally
i
ve
noticed
him
several
times
awfully
he
doesn
t
even
know
they
re
dancing
and
playing
games
out
there
in
the
hall
kitty
said
i
ll
see
if
i
can
draw
him
out
evans
volunteered
she
strolled
from
the
kitchen
and
pretended
to
be
busy
at
the
counter
in
a
casual
manner
she
addressed
ned
wouldn
t
you
like
to
dance
a
bit
no
thanks
i
don
t
want
to
his
tone
was
flat
from
lack
of
interest
they
re
scarce
of
girls
tonight
but
we
re
not
so
busy
either
i
could
spare
one
of
the
canteen
girls
to
play
a
game
of
checkers
with
you
if
you
no
just
inside
the
kitchen
door
kitty
and
sally
listened
to
evans
s
overtures
of
friendship
finally
she
spoke
in
a
motherly
tone
son
you
re
worried
about
something
isn
t
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
then
the
pleading
gray
eyes
looked
up
at
the
motherly
face
and
this
time
they
were
swimming
in
tears
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
appraising
her
finding
the
sympathy
of
her
heart
reflected
in
her
eyes
he
finally
blurted
want
to
hold
a
kitty
watching
beside
sally
in
the
background
fairly
held
her
breath
at
this
unexpected
retort
a
baby
repeated
evans
ned
dug
into
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
yellow
sheet
of
paper
the
girls
saw
it
was
a
telegram
as
he
handed
it
to
her
our
baby
came
yesterday
they
re
in
california
ve
been
so
scared
for
her
the
last
week
i
haven
t
had
good
sense
i
can
t
believe
it
s
all
over
and
she
s
all
oh
that
s
wonderful
exclaimed
evans
and
a
boy
too
eight
he
grew
more
confidential
at
her
warmth
and
understanding
i
could
only
hold
a
baby
once
to
see
how
it
feels
i
ve
never
held
a
baby
maybe
i
can
believe
i
m
a
father
when
i
know
how
a
baby
hot
tears
blinded
kitty
s
eyes
and
her
throat
tightened
how
tragic
it
was
to
be
three
thousand
miles
away
from
your
firstborn
with
no
real
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
before
you
were
sent
across
sally
i
m
going
to
find
a
baby
for
him
to
hold
if
there
s
a
young
baby
on
this
island
kitty
whispered
sally
wiggled
her
button
nose
as
she
too
blinked
back
the
tears
say
but
that
s
tough
where
ll
you
find
a
young
one
kit
i
don
t
know
where
there
s
a
young
i
ll
find
one
you
ll
see
said
kitty
and
dashed
out
to
the
telephone
in
two
minutes
she
had
hazel
dawson
on
the
phone
surely
she
would
know
if
any
of
the
wives
of
the
service
men
up
at
the
hospital
had
young
babies
hazel
was
rather
surprised
at
kitty
s
unusual
request
but
after
a
little
thought
said
mrs
harper
s
baby
is
about
ten
days
old
she
came
back
from
the
hospital
in
town
yesterday
i
do
you
think
you
could
possibly
arrange
for
me
to
bring
ned
miller
up
to
see
it
asked
kitty
i
m
sure
they
d
be
glad
to
have
him
visit
them
hazel
said
kindly
suppose
you
come
past
the
hospital
tomorrow
at
when
i
get
off
duty
and
i
ll
go
with
oh
you
re
an
angel
if
you
could
only
see
this
pathetic
boy
you
d
do
anything
in
the
world
to
make
him
a
little
kitty
tried
not
to
seem
too
excited
over
her
success
when
she
went
back
behind
the
bar
evans
was
still
talking
to
ned
when
she
joined
them
the
harpers
have
a
young
baby
she
said
almost
bluntly
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
and
his
sensitive
face
flushed
maybe
you
think
it
s
silly
of
me
he
apologized
but
it
s
an
awful
feeling
to
be
three
thousand
miles
away
from
your
wife
and
you
re
not
silly
at
all
i
d
be
thrilled
to
pieces
to
go
to
see
the
harpers
baby
with
you
they
re
friends
of
hazel
dawson
you
know
ensign
dawson
up
at
the
hospital
sure
she
s
always
ready
to
help
the
harpers
baby
is
a
few
days
older
than
yours
but
then
they
d
feel
the
you
re
so
kind
to
go
to
all
that
trouble
for
i
ll
pick
you
up
in
our
car
tomorrow
at
i
m
going
over
to
get
miss
dawson
anyhow
she
said
she
d
go
with
us
and
make
arrangements
with
the
i
just
can
t
thank
you
a
smile
actually
brightened
ned
s
face
as
he
spoke
while
kitty
was
still
talking
to
him
vera
came
in
with
half
a
dozen
girls
after
she
turned
them
loose
in
the
hall
she
went
behind
the
snack
bar
looking
rather
excited
kitty
suggested
that
one
of
the
new
arrivals
dance
with
ned
and
when
they
had
gone
she
said
to
vera
hear
you
had
quite
a
illustration
you
re
not
silly
at
all
kitty
told
i
ll
were
you
alone
when
you
got
stuck
asked
sally
sure
you
never
get
stuck
when
there
s
anyone
along
to
where
were
you
asked
kitty
on
that
lonely
stretch
of
road
leading
to
the
thompson
place
i
went
out
there
to
get
nancy
rain
had
made
the
sand
all
gooey
this
side
of
waco
bridge
and
i
got
stuck
in
that
dark
swampy
road
asked
sally
it
would
be
there
said
vera
in
disgust
i
worked
till
nearly
dark
trying
to
get
out
then
i
started
on
foot
toward
thompsons
i
was
just
about
to
cross
the
bridge
over
waco
creek
when
i
heard
oars
up
the
i
d
have
been
scared
stiff
there
by
myself
said
sally
with
a
shiver
i
was
too
mad
over
being
stuck
to
feel
scared
vera
stated
i
yelled
for
that
boatman
to
come
and
help
me
him
i
was
well
said
kitty
sensing
there
was
something
very
peculiar
to
come
he
did
help
you
of
not
that
sneak
the
minute
i
yelled
for
help
those
oars
stopped
and
i
never
heard
another
why
he
couldn
t
help
but
know
it
was
a
woman
calling
kitty
exclaimed
sure
he
knew
it
was
a
woman
in
i
can
t
understand
that
said
sally
i
ve
lived
round
here
all
my
life
and
all
the
natives
white
and
colored
will
go
to
no
end
of
trouble
to
help
a
person
out
of
a
tight
spot
specially
i
figured
he
was
no
native
and
up
to
some
skulduggery
said
vera
i
went
on
down
the
road
and
got
nancy
thompson
s
brother
and
we
searched
that
creek
with
flashlights
as
far
as
we
could
and
found
nothing
asked
kitty
that
sneak
had
cleared
out
while
i
was
gone
if
you
ask
me
there
s
plenty
happening
on
this
island
that
s
not
printed
in
the
secretly
kitty
agreed
with
her
the
incident
made
her
only
more
determined
not
to
relax
her
vigilance
about
certain
peculiar
people
she
was
watching
the
next
afternoon
kitty
was
waiting
outside
hazel
s
door
at
the
hospital
promptly
at
she
soon
heard
the
soft
but
brisk
step
of
her
friend
coming
down
the
hall
come
in
while
i
freshen
up
a
bit
hazel
invited
kitty
had
never
been
in
her
new
friend
s
room
and
felt
a
little
flutter
of
excitement
as
she
went
inside
hazel
proffered
the
only
rocker
invitingly
you
sit
there
and
rest
a
minute
dear
while
i
powder
my
nose
and
brush
my
hair
you
look
as
fresh
as
if
you
hadn
t
had
your
household
to
look
after
all
i
must
admit
i
haven
t
had
any
idle
moments
kitty
confessed
while
hazel
was
in
the
bathroom
kitty
glanced
around
the
room
that
had
been
made
so
homelike
with
many
individual
touches
on
the
dresser
she
noticed
a
picture
of
a
handsome
man
evidently
slightly
older
than
hazel
her
heart
sank
with
misgivings
perhaps
hazel
was
already
engaged
to
someone
for
a
moment
she
felt
a
pang
of
jealousy
and
resentment
but
she
simply
couldn
t
believe
hazel
would
lead
her
father
on
if
she
were
in
love
with
someone
else
who
s
the
man
she
asked
frankly
when
hazel
returned
to
the
room
that
s
my
oh
yes
of
brother
willard
i
ve
heard
you
speak
but
how
did
you
know
his
name
never
mention
him
the
day
i
met
you
in
the
launch
lieutenant
cary
spoke
of
hazel
s
tone
became
a
degree
cooler
he
used
to
be
stationed
here
she
added
after
a
moment
so
dad
said
he
was
sent
here
in
his
place
i
i
hope
we
don
t
live
to
regret
his
asking
for
this
mean
dad
asked
for
this
appointment
oh
beg
pardon
i
thought
you
knew
no
i
didn
t
i
knew
nothing
about
it
till
dad
wrote
me
he
was
coming
to
palmetto
island
and
it
would
be
a
grand
place
for
me
and
billy
to
why
had
both
her
father
and
hazel
asked
to
come
here
after
the
trouble
hazel
s
brother
had
had
to
cover
her
confused
thoughts
kitty
took
the
picture
from
the
dresser
and
studied
the
face
frankly
now
she
could
see
a
resemblance
to
hazel
in
that
strong
chin
firm
mouth
and
the
wide
frank
eyes
she
could
find
no
evidence
of
one
whose
conduct
might
merit
his
being
relegated
to
some
obscure
naval
station
as
she
and
hazel
went
out
to
meet
ned
miller
in
the
lobby
below
she
was
more
convinced
than
ever
that
there
was
something
mysterious
going
on
in
which
her
father
was
deeply
involved
hazel
proved
herself
an
understanding
pal
that
afternoon
she
made
it
seem
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
ned
should
want
to
see
a
tiny
baby
kitty
thought
she
had
never
seen
anyone
so
frightened
and
so
awkward
as
ned
when
he
first
took
that
little
blanketed
form
in
his
arms
but
with
every
passing
minute
his
stiffness
and
embarrassment
grew
less
before
their
brief
call
was
over
he
had
promised
to
carve
the
baby
a
wooden
bowl
and
spoon
for
his
first
eating
i
like
to
carve
things
he
said
i
made
one
for
my
own
youngster
two
months
he
seemed
to
expand
to
new
importance
as
he
spoke
when
kitty
and
ned
left
together
hazel
stayed
on
for
a
longer
visit
with
her
friends
as
they
drove
away
kitty
remarked
i
didn
t
notice
till
this
afternoon
that
you
re
one
of
the
boys
who
work
in
the
i
like
it
pretty
well
there
admitted
ned
i
like
doing
things
with
my
hands
glad
they
didn
t
put
me
where
i
have
to
work
at
a
desk
or
anything
like
and
it
helps
a
lot
when
you
like
the
people
you
work
with
said
kitty
not
without
an
ulterior
motive
my
boss
is
natured
as
they
make
krome
you
mean
chief
steward
krome
only
one
trouble
about
snores
like
a
steam
engine
you
punch
him
and
wake
him
up
and
he
goes
right
back
at
it
isn
t
there
a
thin
dark
fellow
named
punaro
down
in
the
galley
yeah
he
collects
waste
from
over
the
hospital
and
does
things
like
that
looks
after
the
kitchen
garbage
i
saw
him
over
at
the
uso
the
other
night
playing
chess
with
lieutenant
ned
sent
her
an
odd
look
and
said
you
did
after
an
interval
he
added
diffidently
i
m
not
the
kind
to
talk
about
people
miss
kitty
but
if
you
were
my
sister
i
wouldn
t
want
you
to
be
letting
him
take
you
home
from
canteen
or
anything
like
punaro
thanks
for
the
hint
she
wanted
to
ask
him
more
but
didn
t
know
how
without
betraying
those
she
felt
she
had
no
reason
to
suspect
they
parted
in
the
lobby
as
kitty
turned
off
toward
her
father
s
office
but
she
thought
how
odd
it
at
almost
every
contact
she
made
the
tangled
web
of
clues
she
was
picking
up
became
more
bewildering
chapter
eight
what
s
in
a
title
when
kitty
told
hazel
about
the
shortage
of
girls
at
the
uso
on
that
stormy
night
her
friend
said
stop
by
for
me
next
time
you
go
to
canteen
my
evenings
are
rather
lonely
i
ll
be
glad
to
help
entertain
the
i
ll
have
to
get
a
card
for
you
but
that
won
t
be
any
trouble
said
kitty
however
hazel
s
remark
about
her
lonely
evenings
left
kitty
somewhat
at
sea
her
father
was
away
from
home
several
evenings
a
week
and
she
had
thought
he
was
spending
them
with
hazel
now
she
felt
she
had
been
mistaken
next
time
kitty
was
on
duty
at
the
snack
bar
she
went
over
to
the
hospital
for
hazel
and
together
they
walked
the
five
blocks
to
the
uso
hall
as
they
walked
along
the
main
street
in
the
twilight
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
docks
with
their
dimmed
boat
lights
at
each
street
intersection
i
love
living
here
don
t
you
said
kitty
under
different
circumstances
it
would
be
quite
an
interesting
under
different
circumstances
kitty
s
tone
implied
her
puzzlement
i
m
in
rather
an
awkward
spot
you
know
my
brother
had
a
very
unpleasant
time
blamed
for
something
of
which
he
was
oh
i
m
naturally
i
still
feel
the
cloud
hanging
over
me
i
ll
never
be
quite
happy
till
my
brother
is
is
there
anything
i
can
do
i
wish
i
could
i
m
afraid
there
s
nothing
anyone
can
do
outside
the
kitty
wanted
to
ask
for
more
details
but
the
tone
of
hazel
s
last
remark
suggested
that
the
subject
was
closed
in
fact
she
felt
very
much
surprised
that
her
friend
had
been
as
frank
as
she
had
about
the
matter
at
the
uso
hall
they
separated
for
a
while
hazel
to
help
amuse
the
boys
while
kitty
went
into
the
canteen
quarters
when
she
slipped
off
her
coat
and
put
on
her
apron
she
went
out
to
the
bar
to
find
ned
miller
waiting
for
her
he
seemed
as
bright
as
a
sunny
day
after
a
long
rainy
spell
miss
kitty
you
ll
never
guess
what
s
happened
he
exclaimed
your
wife
and
baby
aren
t
flying
to
palmetto
island
already
oh
no
nothing
so
marvelous
as
that
but
surprising
then
spill
the
news
ned
and
don
t
keep
me
in
suspense
she
encouraged
the
harpers
have
asked
me
to
be
godfather
for
their
oh
ned
that
s
super
imagine
me
a
father
and
a
godfather
all
in
one
week
judy
sally
and
evans
drew
nearer
to
add
their
congratulations
to
kitty
s
you
ve
all
got
to
drink
a
hot
chocolate
with
me
to
celebrate
continued
ned
proudly
it
s
on
me
this
time
evans
poured
the
chocolate
and
topped
it
with
an
unusually
generous
spoonful
of
whipped
cream
this
is
on
the
canteen
she
said
and
they
all
made
merry
over
the
great
event
you
must
all
come
to
the
christening
a
week
from
sunday
at
the
little
chapel
a
block
from
the
hazel
came
presently
and
took
ned
off
for
some
dancing
as
kitty
watched
them
go
there
was
a
tender
light
in
her
eyes
how
happy
she
felt
to
realize
that
she
had
made
the
sun
break
through
the
fog
for
at
least
one
boy
during
a
lull
in
business
some
time
later
she
drew
up
a
stool
and
watched
the
activities
in
the
large
hall
at
the
right
in
an
open
space
around
the
piano
a
dozen
or
more
couples
danced
while
a
marine
kept
the
keys
warm
with
his
nimble
fingers
in
the
space
directly
in
front
of
the
bar
were
tables
where
couples
and
foursomes
played
all
manner
of
games
some
boys
lolled
on
couches
or
in
large
armchairs
with
books
or
magazines
while
others
sat
at
desks
against
the
wall
writing
letters
home
apparently
unmindful
of
the
confusion
around
them
presently
kitty
s
survey
was
checked
as
her
gaze
came
to
rest
once
more
on
lieutenant
cary
playing
chess
again
this
time
the
players
were
sitting
so
she
could
see
the
profiles
of
both
men
instantly
she
recognized
the
physician
s
partner
as
the
boy
punaro
whom
she
had
seen
on
the
bus
that
memorable
night
before
the
big
fire
at
the
cannery
the
last
time
she
had
noticed
cary
here
he
was
playing
with
chief
commissary
steward
krome
she
wondered
why
he
was
on
such
intimate
terms
with
the
galley
staff
presently
she
was
aware
that
hazel
dawson
had
returned
to
the
bar
and
was
sitting
on
a
stool
across
the
counter
does
lieutenant
cary
come
here
very
often
she
asked
only
does
he
always
play
chess
with
someone
from
the
galley
kitty
sent
hazel
a
surprised
glance
yes
both
times
i
ve
seen
him
playing
the
other
night
it
was
the
chief
commissary
steward
i
can
understand
that
krome
has
his
rank
but
tonight
he
buddies
with
the
boy
who
empties
our
kitty
bent
closer
and
lowered
her
voice
do
you
know
anything
about
punaro
fellow
hazel
showed
surprise
at
the
question
as
she
countered
why
do
you
ask
do
you
know
anything
about
him
he
was
here
the
other
she
thought
of
adding
that
they
had
come
home
on
the
same
bus
the
night
of
the
cannery
fire
but
caution
silenced
her
there
were
too
many
around
who
might
have
keen
ears
brad
came
in
later
you
re
almost
a
stranger
kitty
greeted
him
hazel
went
off
with
one
of
the
boys
who
claimed
her
for
a
dance
and
brad
leaned
closer
i
was
too
busy
to
come
sooner
but
i
wanted
to
get
over
here
in
time
to
see
you
home
something
to
tell
i
brought
hazel
with
me
we
ll
have
to
take
her
back
to
the
hospital
before
we
can
glad
you
came
she
added
after
a
moment
you
can
go
with
me
to
hunt
up
chief
krome
he
promised
me
that
shrimp
creole
yeah
sure
we
want
it
for
that
picnic
they
say
the
only
way
you
ever
get
a
recipe
out
of
krome
is
to
go
after
it
he
looks
too
easygoing
to
let
the
mild
matter
of
a
promise
like
that
weigh
on
his
sure
is
nice
of
you
canteen
girls
to
go
down
on
the
beach
and
fix
that
supper
for
us
tomorrow
ned
miller
s
looking
forward
to
it
too
you
sure
lifted
his
countenance
kitty
flushed
oh
i
guess
i
got
as
big
a
kick
out
of
it
as
he
there
was
an
awkward
pause
and
she
looked
about
for
something
to
change
the
subject
finally
she
nudged
brad
s
arm
and
whispered
take
a
look
over
in
the
south
corner
at
those
chess
brad
glanced
at
them
and
whistled
softly
the
trail
grows
warmer
find
out
anything
about
punaro
plenty
but
we
ll
save
that
till
later
but
when
you
see
two
suspected
ones
hobnobbing
it
begins
to
look
as
though
something
is
an
hour
before
closing
time
kitty
saw
the
chess
players
leave
their
board
and
go
out
they
hadn
t
patronized
the
snack
bar
all
evening
that
was
one
night
kitty
was
glad
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
she
had
had
no
opportunity
for
a
private
talk
with
brad
for
some
time
and
she
had
much
on
her
mind
at
the
hospital
they
left
hazel
at
her
door
and
took
the
elevator
down
to
the
basement
surely
am
glad
you
came
along
brad
said
kitty
i
wouldn
t
like
to
be
hunting
up
chief
krome
at
this
hour
of
the
night
by
there
was
no
one
in
sight
when
they
got
off
the
elevator
at
the
basement
floor
i
ve
never
been
down
here
before
kitty
remarked
as
she
followed
brad
toward
the
chief
cook
s
quarters
quite
a
nifty
arrangement
brad
explained
extending
out
front
this
wing
of
the
hospital
is
a
platform
running
right
down
to
a
dock
over
the
water
supply
boats
come
almost
right
up
to
the
building
saves
an
awful
lot
in
transportation
of
fuel
and
kitty
felt
no
particular
interest
in
what
brad
said
she
was
eager
to
get
the
recipe
from
krome
and
return
to
the
street
where
she
and
brad
could
talk
without
fear
of
being
overheard
brad
knocked
on
krome
s
door
several
times
but
got
no
answer
must
be
out
kitty
said
disappointed
they
were
about
to
turn
away
when
ned
miller
came
running
down
the
stairs
looking
for
krome
he
asked
seeing
them
outside
the
chief
cook
s
door
he
promised
me
that
shrimp
creole
recipe
and
they
say
i
ll
have
to
run
him
down
to
get
it
kitty
explained
i
ll
go
ask
him
for
it
for
you
offered
ned
eager
to
be
of
service
to
kitty
i
saw
him
up
in
the
recreation
room
as
i
came
through
playing
chess
with
lieutenant
oh
you
did
exclaimed
kitty
but
ned
was
already
hurrying
back
toward
the
stairs
they
were
about
to
follow
when
brad
said
come
while
we
re
down
here
i
ll
show
you
the
not
wanting
to
be
rude
enough
to
tell
him
it
didn
t
interest
her
in
the
least
kitty
followed
brad
toward
the
double
doors
that
stood
wide
open
at
the
end
of
the
cement
passage
there
was
only
a
shaded
light
outside
her
first
impression
was
a
confused
one
of
several
barges
huddled
against
the
dock
piled
high
with
boxes
crates
kegs
and
all
manner
of
freight
then
suddenly
she
saw
a
man
at
one
of
the
barges
her
pulse
quickened
when
she
noted
it
was
filled
with
refuse
the
man
had
his
back
to
them
pushing
something
onto
the
barge
it
seemed
to
be
a
large
box
but
kitty
had
only
a
glimpse
for
the
man
threw
a
strip
of
old
sail
over
it
and
turned
sharply
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
as
he
came
toward
them
there
was
indignation
in
his
very
stride
what
do
you
want
here
he
growled
as
he
spoke
and
came
nearer
the
glow
from
the
hallway
kitty
recognized
punaro
who
less
than
an
hour
ago
had
been
playing
chess
in
the
uso
hall
with
lieutenant
cary
we
re
looking
for
krome
said
brad
with
aggravating
nonchalance
he
s
not
down
here
stated
punaro
you
ll
find
him
up
in
the
recreation
room
playing
chess
with
thanks
thanks
a
lot
brad
said
and
kitty
wondered
why
his
thanks
was
so
profuse
when
they
went
down
the
hall
they
found
ned
returning
from
above
chief
said
if
i
d
bring
his
recipe
book
he
d
find
the
thing
you
want
and
let
you
copy
it
ned
explained
he
s
just
about
to
checkmate
lieutenant
cary
and
can
t
leave
his
game
right
when
ned
went
into
krome
s
quarters
kitty
whispered
to
brad
did
you
notice
anything
queer
out
there
punaro
throwing
a
strip
of
sail
over
a
box
on
the
barge
you
d
make
a
grand
detective
kitty
and
i
noticed
more
but
we
d
better
wait
till
we
get
outside
to
lieutenant
cary
sent
them
an
unwelcome
look
when
they
went
upstairs
but
krome
was
quite
about
the
interruption
he
handed
kitty
his
own
pen
and
a
bit
of
notepaper
on
which
to
write
the
recipe
he
chuckled
and
advised
her
to
spice
it
up
sharply
for
the
boys
illustration
what
do
you
want
here
punaro
asked
when
at
last
they
were
outside
in
the
cool
moonlight
kitty
slipped
her
arm
through
brad
s
and
whispered
there
s
something
mighty
queer
going
you
re
telling
me
i
wouldn
t
trust
that
punaro
one
minute
i
ll
bet
you
a
hundred
dollars
he
s
sneaking
something
out
of
the
hospital
on
that
what
and
where
to
it
now
becomes
our
job
to
find
did
you
notice
anything
queer
about
his
knowing
instantly
where
krome
was
i
ll
say
it
looks
to
me
as
though
cary
got
krome
tied
up
in
that
chess
game
while
punaro
does
what
he
pleases
in
the
that
s
a
wise
deduction
holmes
but
watson
noticed
something
brad
laughed
in
spite
of
his
uneasiness
i
d
call
you
the
sherlock
holmes
and
me
watson
you
were
the
first
to
begin
picking
up
strange
how
so
many
things
have
come
up
to
make
me
know
something
s
wrong
even
ned
miller
warned
me
the
other
day
when
i
mentioned
i
mustn
t
ever
let
him
bring
me
home
that
he
s
not
my
ned
s
in
a
position
to
know
kitty
right
down
there
working
with
him
and
say
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
up
at
the
snack
go
ahead
i
ve
been
bustin
to
i
noticed
punaro
s
shoes
the
other
day
when
he
came
in
to
empty
our
wastebasket
there
s
a
scorched
streak
across
them
but
he
s
evidently
tried
to
polish
it
and
you
really
think
it
could
have
been
caused
by
a
spark
igniting
spilled
gasoline
or
kerosene
it
s
possible
yes
but
doing
work
like
his
it
might
have
been
spilled
acid
too
i
m
afraid
the
circumstantial
evidence
there
is
far
too
weak
to
blame
him
for
the
cannery
of
course
but
later
developments
seem
to
prove
that
my
suspicions
may
not
be
entirely
say
you
were
going
to
tell
me
something
else
you
noticed
out
there
just
do
you
realize
he
called
cary
doctor
not
lieutenant
you
re
did
everybody
else
round
here
calls
him
who
ve
only
known
him
since
he
came
into
the
i
ll
say
your
perception
is
very
keen
kitty
it
seems
proof
that
cary
and
punaro
knew
each
other
before
they
came
into
the
service
i
ll
try
to
find
out
where
they
both
hail
do
brad
if
you
can
this
thing
is
beginning
to
look
very
serious
we
ve
got
to
find
out
what
it
s
all
chapter
nine
into
the
marshes
kitty
had
so
much
on
her
mind
that
night
she
couldn
t
sleep
until
after
one
o
clock
she
didn
t
even
hear
the
alarm
clock
next
morning
and
was
roused
by
the
sunlight
streaming
across
her
bed
she
pulled
on
her
bathrobe
and
ran
to
the
kitchen
what
time
is
it
she
asked
jane
eight
o
clock
yo
pah
done
et
breakfus
and
went
to
de
why
didn
t
you
call
me
wa
n
t
no
use
to
bother
you
you
wus
sleepin
jus
like
a
sho
nuff
but
there
was
something
special
i
wanted
to
talk
to
dad
about
this
you
ll
see
him
but
i
m
going
with
a
bunch
of
canteen
workers
to
fix
supper
for
the
boys
on
the
beach
late
this
kitty
had
just
started
back
to
her
room
when
the
phone
rang
she
found
it
was
hazel
dawson
listen
dear
i
heard
you
say
once
you
always
go
to
town
on
saturday
morning
came
her
friend
s
voice
over
the
wire
yes
i
do
is
there
anything
i
can
get
you
if
it
wouldn
t
be
too
much
bother
i
d
like
you
to
get
me
a
set
of
a
set
of
chessmen
kitty
could
not
hide
her
surprise
chess
had
become
intimately
associated
in
her
mind
with
cary
and
his
partners
hazel
laughed
in
my
old
age
i
ve
suddenly
decided
to
become
a
chess
it
does
seem
to
be
quite
a
fad
around
here
admitted
kitty
i
haven
t
any
way
to
get
the
money
to
you
before
you
oh
that
s
all
right
said
kitty
what
price
do
you
want
to
pay
she
recalled
that
her
grandfather
s
ivory
chessmen
had
been
very
valuable
oh
the
cheapest
ones
you
can
find
will
do
for
me
plastic
or
wood
will
be
all
right
i
only
want
them
so
i
can
learn
the
as
kitty
put
down
the
phone
after
this
unusual
request
she
wondered
what
was
behind
it
she
had
no
doubt
that
hazel
s
motive
in
learning
the
game
had
some
connection
with
lieutenant
cary
s
chess
playing
yet
the
two
made
no
pretense
at
friendship
though
she
had
missed
her
father
at
breakfast
kitty
was
determined
to
see
him
before
she
went
to
town
so
she
decided
to
go
to
the
hospital
by
nine
she
had
eaten
breakfast
and
was
ready
for
the
weekly
shopping
expedition
is
you
gwine
to
tek
billy
to
town
wid
you
asked
jane
seeing
kitty
dressed
so
early
yes
he
has
to
have
a
new
pair
of
shoes
hope
i
can
get
some
ones
he
s
already
used
my
last
dat
boy
can
sho
stomp
out
dem
you
d
better
wake
him
up
and
give
him
breakfast
by
the
time
i
come
back
i
m
going
to
run
up
to
the
hospital
to
see
dad
a
few
all
the
guards
and
attendants
at
the
hospital
knew
kitty
as
the
daughter
of
the
chief
pharmacist
s
mate
she
always
gave
them
a
smile
a
jaunty
salute
and
passed
in
without
comment
a
few
minutes
later
she
slipped
noiselessly
into
her
father
s
office
he
was
busy
going
over
some
order
sheets
with
a
junior
officer
so
kitty
sat
down
near
the
door
till
he
was
at
leisure
see
you
in
a
few
minutes
kitten
her
father
said
when
the
petty
officer
went
out
and
his
stenographer
came
up
with
some
letters
to
be
signed
kitty
thought
how
wonderful
it
was
to
live
where
she
could
occasionally
drop
in
on
her
father
at
his
work
he
had
not
finished
the
letters
when
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
to
her
amazement
young
punaro
stepped
in
and
picked
up
her
father
s
wastebasket
he
didn
t
see
her
till
he
turned
to
go
back
to
the
hall
where
he
had
left
the
large
container
which
he
rolled
along
the
halls
to
collect
trash
by
the
ominous
look
he
sent
her
she
knew
instantly
he
recognized
her
as
the
same
girl
who
had
come
upon
him
unexpectedly
at
the
galley
dock
last
night
before
he
came
back
with
the
empty
basket
her
father
called
her
to
his
desk
he
waited
a
moment
till
punaro
closed
the
door
what
s
on
your
mind
kitten
he
asked
dropping
his
professional
manner
like
a
mask
plenty
she
said
i
don
t
like
that
punaro
fellow
coming
into
your
office
for
one
her
father
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
now
now
you
mustn
t
be
suspicious
of
everyone
who
has
a
slightly
olive
cast
to
his
he
has
a
very
italian
name
you
seem
to
forget
they
re
fighting
on
our
side
yes
but
some
of
them
here
are
still
friends
of
the
knowing
from
experience
that
money
could
often
make
a
person
forget
unpleasant
things
carter
took
out
his
billfold
guess
you
d
like
a
little
change
for
the
trip
to
kitty
laughed
you
ve
never
known
me
to
refuse
money
have
you
dad
not
he
handed
her
a
bill
you
might
get
billy
that
ball
and
mitt
he
s
been
begging
for
it
ll
soon
be
warm
enough
for
him
to
play
outdoors
all
day
maybe
the
ball
will
keep
him
from
climbing
so
many
kitty
smiled
he
s
a
regular
monkey
when
it
comes
to
trees
when
i
take
him
to
the
park
he
picks
out
the
tallest
and
climbs
up
it
like
a
i
m
afraid
nina
spoiled
him
letting
him
climb
that
old
magnolia
in
our
yard
back
dear
aunt
nina
how
i
miss
kitty
sighed
as
she
put
the
money
into
her
purse
yours
is
the
second
order
for
playthings
i
ve
had
this
why
billy
ordered
something
else
not
billy
hazel
dawson
wants
me
to
get
her
a
set
of
hazel
wants
a
set
of
chessmen
he
said
puzzled
seems
to
be
getting
quite
a
fad
lieutenant
cary
plays
every
time
he
comes
to
the
uso
carter
s
tone
carried
a
world
of
meaning
oddly
enough
it
s
generally
with
someone
from
the
galley
first
it
was
chief
krome
and
last
night
it
was
that
young
fellow
punaro
who
was
in
here
just
kitty
s
watching
eyes
caught
the
surprised
look
that
came
into
her
father
s
face
dad
how
long
has
punaro
been
in
the
service
i
don
t
know
two
or
three
months
i
she
felt
he
was
annoyed
with
her
but
couldn
t
keep
from
saying
it
doesn
t
take
so
many
months
for
them
to
show
their
true
colors
does
it
why
so
much
interest
in
this
raw
recruit
illustration
caught
the
surprise
on
her
father
s
some
things
have
happened
recently
to
stir
my
curiosity
she
answered
evasively
her
father
s
attitude
repelled
her
further
confidences
nor
did
she
feel
this
was
the
place
to
talk
too
much
but
she
was
determined
to
learn
the
one
fact
for
which
she
had
come
i
must
go
now
dad
but
tell
me
one
more
anything
you
want
to
know
except
military
secrets
he
replied
becoming
playful
again
because
she
was
so
serious
why
do
they
haul
the
hospital
refuse
away
on
a
barge
instead
of
burning
it
in
the
incinerator
as
they
do
in
other
hospitals
we
had
an
explosion
at
the
incinerator
several
weeks
ago
for
some
reason
they
ve
been
slow
in
getting
it
i
see
said
kitty
with
a
significant
nod
and
in
the
meantime
i
suppose
the
garbage
is
hauled
off
somewhere
in
the
marshes
and
burned
that
s
suddenly
her
father
s
face
became
very
serious
and
he
sent
her
a
penetrating
glance
what
are
you
driving
at
kitty
with
all
these
strange
questions
haven
t
time
to
explain
now
she
said
evasively
for
so
long
kitty
had
had
to
solve
her
own
problems
when
her
father
was
at
distant
stations
that
she
had
not
yet
learned
how
to
make
a
confidant
of
him
nor
did
she
want
to
run
the
risk
of
having
him
put
a
stop
to
her
investigations
but
she
made
bold
to
ask
one
further
question
do
you
know
where
they
haul
the
garbage
dad
he
led
her
to
the
window
and
pointed
across
the
marshes
see
that
smoke
on
the
south
that
s
it
that
s
where
they
burn
why
so
far
away
we
couldn
t
stand
the
stench
if
it
was
too
close
even
at
that
distance
a
southwest
wind
will
bring
the
odor
into
my
window
i
ll
surely
be
thankful
when
they
use
the
incinerator
kitty
s
mind
was
clicking
like
a
teletype
machine
as
she
left
the
hospital
she
hadn
t
used
their
boat
in
a
week
and
felt
she
was
entitled
to
a
little
gasoline
for
explorations
billy
looked
forward
to
these
weekly
visits
to
town
with
keen
delight
so
kitty
didn
t
have
the
heart
to
curtail
his
enjoyment
they
paid
their
usual
visit
to
the
toy
department
at
the
dime
store
and
took
a
peep
at
the
ducks
in
bayshore
park
at
noon
they
ate
at
a
lunch
counter
perched
on
high
stools
which
billy
adored
afterward
kitty
made
her
weekly
food
purchases
at
the
grocery
store
on
bay
street
opposite
where
she
always
left
her
boat
when
the
grocery
boy
had
packed
her
things
into
the
launch
kitty
looked
at
billy
gave
him
a
knowing
wink
and
asked
want
to
go
exploring
oh
kit
where
you
ll
see
way
into
the
billy
s
eyes
grew
round
into
a
cove
or
somepen
where
pirates
hide
their
booty
no
telling
what
we
ll
find
way
off
in
the
it
was
already
and
at
five
vera
was
to
pick
kitty
up
for
the
trip
to
the
beach
she
would
have
to
do
her
exploring
in
that
interval
of
time
she
had
made
a
careful
note
of
the
location
of
that
smoke
smudge
on
the
horizon
as
her
father
pointed
it
out
from
his
office
however
kitty
didn
t
feel
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
marshy
inlets
to
take
a
short
cut
to
the
spot
she
decided
the
safest
course
was
to
return
near
enough
to
palmetto
island
to
get
her
bearings
from
there
and
seek
out
the
channel
through
which
the
barge
from
the
hospital
traveled
in
going
to
the
dump
aren
t
we
gonner
explore
billy
asked
in
a
disappointed
tone
when
the
smoke
stacks
of
the
marine
base
came
into
view
we
re
going
to
turn
off
into
this
inlet
right
here
kitty
reassured
him
a
bit
of
wind
was
blowing
making
whitecaps
dot
the
deep
green
water
though
the
weather
was
pleasant
enough
ashore
there
was
a
sharp
tang
on
the
water
that
brought
a
glow
to
their
cheeks
in
the
narrowing
inlet
southwest
of
palmetto
island
kitty
had
to
cut
down
her
speed
to
keep
from
running
aground
in
the
curving
channel
she
had
never
been
in
this
section
of
the
marshes
before
and
she
thought
how
easy
it
would
be
to
get
lost
on
the
crisscross
winding
inlets
that
interlaced
the
marshy
islands
most
of
these
green
mud
flats
were
treeless
but
far
off
in
the
direction
of
that
smoke
smudge
which
was
her
destination
the
horizon
was
broken
by
palmettoes
and
pines
where
s
the
pirate
s
lair
billy
finally
asked
growing
impatient
to
reach
some
destination
we
re
almost
there
kitty
assured
him
they
were
near
enough
now
to
see
two
or
three
spirals
of
smoke
rising
from
a
mound
of
rubbish
dumped
on
a
sloping
shore
fortunately
the
wind
was
out
of
the
east
and
carried
smoke
away
from
them
so
kitty
had
a
clear
view
of
the
dump
she
shivered
to
see
buzzards
circling
above
the
smoking
pile
of
refuse
what
a
fitting
place
she
thought
for
spies
to
meet
for
their
diabolical
planning
had
some
foreign
agent
met
punaro
here
this
morning
to
take
away
that
box
of
supplies
she
had
noticed
on
the
barge
as
she
drew
nearer
she
saw
the
rubbish
was
burning
on
an
old
oyster
reef
off
the
north
end
of
a
large
island
the
southern
side
was
densely
overgrown
with
palmettoes
pines
oaks
and
a
tangled
thicket
of
mangroves
along
shore
get
out
the
field
glasses
billy
she
ordered
and
we
ll
see
if
we
can
find
any
gurgled
billy
he
made
a
dive
for
the
stern
locker
where
they
kept
odds
and
ends
it
was
all
wonderful
to
him
kitty
had
slowed
the
launch
and
before
she
took
the
glasses
she
cut
off
the
motor
and
let
the
boat
drift
a
quick
survey
of
the
dump
heap
made
her
want
to
explore
even
if
it
was
a
repulsive
spot
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
with
billy
along
she
was
afraid
to
come
even
this
close
for
fear
he
would
pick
up
some
germ
the
very
thought
made
her
hand
him
the
glasses
and
start
the
motor
again
though
it
was
already
growing
late
she
decided
to
take
a
turn
around
the
small
island
she
was
glad
she
had
taken
the
chance
when
she
reached
the
opposite
side
there
she
found
a
deep
open
channel
moving
eastward
toward
the
sea
billy
kept
looking
through
the
glasses
toward
the
island
while
kitty
studied
the
channel
looks
deep
enough
to
float
a
sub
she
thought
kit
let
s
go
home
exclaimed
billy
sudden
terror
in
his
voice
why
i
saw
somebody
looking
at
us
from
the
woods
yonder
maybe
it
was
a
though
kitty
took
the
glasses
from
her
small
brother
s
hands
she
could
see
nothing
in
the
mangrove
jungle
had
it
been
only
his
vivid
imagination
or
had
he
seen
someone
however
she
did
not
tarry
to
find
out
as
she
gave
her
motor
all
the
power
it
would
take
and
headed
for
home
chapter
ten
the
beach
party
it
was
four
o
clock
by
the
time
kitty
came
ashore
on
palmetto
island
at
a
landing
spot
a
block
behind
her
house
she
sent
billy
home
with
an
armful
of
bundles
to
bring
jane
down
to
help
with
the
unloading
there
was
many
a
job
to
be
done
in
the
next
hour
but
kitty
had
learned
how
to
make
every
minute
count
she
put
the
groceries
in
the
closet
and
the
perishable
food
in
the
ice
box
she
planned
the
evening
meal
for
her
father
and
billy
and
had
just
put
on
her
slacks
when
vera
drove
up
and
honked
the
horn
it
was
nice
to
sit
back
temporarily
free
of
responsibility
and
enjoy
her
ride
across
the
island
with
the
competent
vera
at
the
wheel
in
the
basket
at
her
feet
were
the
ingredients
for
chief
krome
s
famous
shrimp
creole
all
except
the
shrimp
which
the
boys
were
at
that
moment
catching
the
drive
to
the
beach
carried
them
over
a
half
dozen
bridges
spanning
marshy
inlets
finally
they
rolled
off
the
pavement
into
a
road
winding
through
a
palmetto
thicket
the
station
wagon
turned
off
finally
to
the
hard
beach
and
they
rolled
along
within
a
few
feet
of
the
tumbling
breakers
as
kitty
looked
across
the
water
mottled
with
whitecaps
she
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
enemy
subs
might
at
that
very
moment
be
lurking
in
the
cool
depths
somebody
sent
down
a
boat
off
shore
in
the
last
hours
said
sally
look
at
that
oily
scum
on
the
water
and
the
junk
floating
the
receding
tide
had
left
part
of
a
bunch
of
bananas
right
in
their
path
while
crates
bottles
empty
boxes
and
splintered
timbers
bobbed
up
and
down
on
the
tide
we
have
just
three
hours
to
fix
our
chow
eat
and
get
out
of
here
said
vera
or
i
ll
never
get
through
that
sandy
road
without
i
suppose
it
is
too
close
to
the
beach
to
use
headlights
in
there
said
judy
they
all
knew
that
no
lights
were
permitted
anywhere
along
the
entire
shore
and
that
the
beach
was
even
more
carefully
patrolled
at
night
than
in
the
day
i
don
t
care
to
get
stuck
on
a
sandy
road
again
said
vera
they
were
to
meet
the
boys
a
mile
downshore
where
an
inlet
cut
through
the
beach
to
join
the
sea
the
boys
had
already
been
shrimping
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
shallows
of
this
inlet
when
the
station
wagon
turned
a
sharp
bend
in
the
beach
the
girls
saw
a
curl
of
smoke
rising
beyond
a
large
sand
dune
that
shielded
the
light
of
the
campfire
from
possible
watchers
at
sea
vera
had
to
keep
the
car
to
a
narrow
strip
of
beach
between
the
rolling
dry
dunes
and
the
breakers
when
the
boys
saw
them
pull
up
behind
the
dune
they
came
trotting
over
to
help
unload
we
ve
got
the
nicest
mess
of
shrimp
you
ever
saw
boasted
ned
miller
proudly
how
long
have
you
been
here
asked
kitty
long
enough
to
catch
something
more
than
shrimp
retorted
jimmy
you
re
not
ahead
of
us
sally
told
them
we
saw
rubbish
washing
up
all
along
shore
a
must
have
hit
somebody
out
we
don
t
claim
we
ve
located
the
admitted
ned
but
we
did
find
an
old
bateau
hidden
under
some
at
least
five
miles
from
any
habitation
added
jimmy
oh
i
thought
they
had
something
said
vera
with
a
laugh
if
you
had
lived
in
this
part
of
the
country
as
long
as
i
have
you
d
be
used
to
bateaux
and
old
boats
in
all
sorts
of
kitty
watched
brad
s
face
intently
during
this
exchange
and
finally
their
eyes
met
his
expression
implied
that
he
would
tell
her
more
later
there
was
no
opportunity
however
in
the
next
hour
for
them
to
talk
privately
the
boys
were
already
preparing
the
shrimp
for
the
pot
and
kitty
quickly
mixed
the
other
ingredients
the
shrimp
creole
was
soon
cooking
in
the
meantime
they
sat
on
the
sands
around
the
campfire
its
warm
glow
was
more
than
welcome
in
the
biting
salt
air
jimmy
barnes
amused
them
with
a
tale
while
they
waited
the
beach
guard
stopped
to
chat
with
us
a
few
minutes
ago
jimmy
began
the
coast
guard
station
was
several
miles
down
the
coast
from
the
marine
base
kitty
had
seen
very
little
of
those
men
since
she
came
to
palmetto
island
jim
asked
the
chap
if
he
didn
t
get
lonesome
down
here
put
in
ned
lonesome
said
the
guard
why
man
i
ve
got
a
box
seat
at
the
livest
show
in
then
he
told
us
something
that
ll
make
your
eyes
pop
explained
jimmy
about
a
week
ago
he
said
a
sub
was
hit
right
in
sight
of
palmetto
island
and
you
d
never
guess
what
they
found
cut
out
the
suspense
ned
and
tell
us
what
vera
ordered
fresh
bread
wrapped
in
bayshore
bakery
no
not
really
exclaimed
kitty
recalling
her
interesting
visit
to
the
bakery
and
the
spicy
little
cakes
each
nutrition
student
had
been
given
as
a
souvenir
of
course
nobody
can
blame
the
bayshore
bakery
jimmy
hastened
to
say
but
it
only
goes
to
show
that
the
are
getting
all
sorts
of
supplies
from
our
own
towns
they
say
that
bread
was
t
have
been
more
than
a
day
it
s
hard
to
believe
such
things
are
going
on
said
lana
bright
her
big
brown
eyes
wide
as
she
glanced
anxiously
toward
the
eastern
horizon
in
the
good
old
days
there
had
always
been
steamers
or
small
craft
on
the
horizon
but
now
every
ship
that
passed
must
be
convoyed
for
protection
against
subs
sally
and
lana
had
been
brought
up
on
the
southern
coast
and
found
it
hard
to
realize
that
a
enemy
could
encroach
on
their
childhood
playground
as
they
had
always
considered
the
beach
and
that
s
still
happening
even
after
most
people
feel
we
ve
practically
got
the
situation
in
hand
commented
kitty
yes
and
when
we
take
the
complacent
attitude
that
we
ve
got
any
of
this
war
business
under
control
and
sit
down
on
the
job
there
s
bound
to
be
trouble
stated
brad
that
coast
guard
chap
also
told
us
about
those
oil
tankers
that
were
attacked
right
off
this
very
shore
last
week
continued
jimmy
i
heard
the
firing
exclaimed
kitty
at
first
i
thought
it
was
thunder
but
dad
said
when
he
came
home
that
a
had
been
sunk
out
and
the
guard
saw
the
whole
works
ned
told
them
eagerly
he
said
the
tankers
were
going
when
the
sub
attacked
them
in
two
minutes
he
had
the
coast
guard
station
over
his
and
ten
minutes
later
our
planes
were
dropping
depth
bombs
and
boy
they
got
that
sub
i
d
have
given
anything
to
be
down
here
makes
me
wish
i
d
gone
into
the
coast
guard
after
hearing
all
this
kitty
felt
still
more
uneasy
about
her
experience
earlier
in
the
afternoon
could
it
be
possible
that
the
man
billy
had
seen
on
the
island
was
the
same
who
owned
that
boat
hidden
in
the
mangroves
she
had
noticed
no
boat
herself
but
one
certainly
could
have
been
hidden
in
the
dense
shrubbery
that
overhung
the
water
kitty
was
relieved
when
their
supper
was
ready
and
the
hungry
boys
had
been
served
vera
poured
the
hot
coffee
and
sally
supplied
them
with
fresh
bread
from
the
bayshore
bakery
makes
you
feel
sort
of
funny
eating
this
bread
and
knowing
the
germans
have
recently
eaten
bread
out
of
the
same
kind
of
wrappers
said
kitty
giving
brad
a
significant
look
as
she
handed
him
a
plate
let
s
sit
over
on
that
palmetto
log
he
suggested
when
she
picked
up
her
own
plate
illustration
the
coast
guard
saw
it
all
ned
told
other
couples
had
paired
off
and
kitty
was
glad
that
at
last
she
had
a
chance
to
talk
privately
with
brad
what
about
that
boat
you
saw
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
when
they
were
seated
wish
the
others
hadn
t
spread
the
news
do
you
think
it
has
any
connection
with
the
mysterious
business
we
re
trailing
there
s
no
telling
if
it
leaks
out
at
the
hospital
that
people
are
getting
wise
to
the
skulduggery
it
may
put
a
temporary
stop
to
the
dirty
business
and
throw
us
off
the
where
did
you
see
that
boat
kitty
asked
south
end
of
that
where
they
re
burning
the
hospital
kitty
s
fork
stopped
in
and
she
stared
speechless
at
brad
a
moment
why
brad
i
passed
that
very
spot
you
he
exclaimed
incredulously
what
were
you
doing
there
alone
not
alone
billy
was
with
briefly
she
gave
him
an
account
of
her
day
beginning
with
the
conversation
in
her
father
s
office
brad
i
m
convinced
punaro
is
smuggling
something
out
of
the
hospital
with
the
garbage
who
knows
but
what
he
s
the
one
keeping
these
supplied
with
fresh
bread
green
vegetables
and
stuff
like
they
re
getting
it
from
somewhere
and
that
s
a
certainty
stated
brad
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
said
anxiously
but
kitty
you
shouldn
t
have
gone
off
there
in
the
marshes
billy
was
with
me
you
forget
i
was
practically
brought
up
in
a
boat
brad
i
m
never
afraid
on
the
but
it
s
dangerous
now
promise
me
kit
you
won
t
ever
go
off
like
that
alone
she
laughed
at
his
fears
but
her
pulse
beat
a
little
faster
because
of
his
solicitude
i
may
have
to
sometime
brad
but
i
ll
promise
to
be
more
why
anything
could
have
happened
to
you
that
man
could
have
fired
from
the
mangroves
and
nobody
would
ever
have
known
what
had
become
of
you
but
i
had
to
know
where
that
barge
took
the
stuff
what
the
general
situation
was
i
didn
t
even
think
about
being
is
not
till
billy
told
me
about
seeing
the
man
through
our
they
were
silent
while
they
finished
their
supper
then
kitty
said
brad
i
ve
always
spies
come
ashore
from
the
subs
in
rubber
so
they
but
didn
t
jimmy
say
the
one
they
saw
was
an
old
bateau
so
it
was
maybe
that
s
the
boat
that
comes
out
to
meet
the
enemy
boats
we
ve
already
caught
several
of
the
native
fishermen
round
here
in
the
pay
of
enemy
spies
no
doubt
there
re
still
plenty
of
others
free
and
it
seems
incredible
that
anyone
could
be
so
unpatriotic
and
you
don
t
know
people
like
i
do
kit
plenty
of
people
will
sell
their
very
souls
for
a
little
but
the
risks
they
take
how
do
they
get
away
with
it
you
d
be
surprised
if
you
knew
why
when
we
first
went
to
war
fishing
boats
all
along
the
coast
were
supplying
german
subs
with
gasoline
right
under
the
nose
of
the
and
all
of
us
so
skimped
for
gasoline
then
the
government
took
over
most
of
the
fishing
boats
and
conditions
kitty
leaned
closer
and
said
with
determination
and
brad
we
re
going
to
put
a
stop
to
the
dirty
work
going
on
at
our
hospital
if
i
can
t
give
all
my
time
to
my
country
maybe
i
can
help
in
this
i
m
afraid
we
ve
got
a
big
job
kit
but
every
day
i
become
more
certain
that
there
s
something
going
on
round
there
that
is
really
she
glanced
at
him
sharply
anything
new
turned
up
he
nodded
it
may
or
may
not
be
important
i
talked
to
ivy
the
man
who
looks
after
the
oh
do
you
think
he
s
working
with
punaro
and
maybe
lieutenant
cary
no
i
don
t
i
believe
ivy
s
on
the
level
if
ever
a
man
was
he
s
terribly
upset
over
not
being
able
to
get
the
incinerator
fixed
he
says
repair
parts
have
come
twice
and
both
times
they
didn
t
somebody
at
the
factory
is
trying
to
hold
up
the
repairs
looks
that
way
and
ivy
swears
the
explosion
in
the
incinerator
was
the
work
of
saboteurs
poor
fellow
he
almost
got
a
for
it
himself
if
he
hadn
t
had
such
a
wonderful
record
for
five
years
back
i
guess
he
would
what
do
you
think
all
this
adds
up
to
brad
seems
plain
as
the
nose
on
a
man
s
face
the
incinerator
is
kept
out
of
order
to
give
a
free
hand
to
the
spies
in
getting
the
stuff
out
of
the
hospital
and
into
the
marshes
where
it
can
be
picked
up
by
the
kitty
felt
the
goose
flesh
prickle
along
her
spine
she
had
never
dreamed
when
she
came
to
palmetto
island
and
went
into
canteen
work
that
she
would
find
herself
in
the
midst
of
such
dangerous
intrigue
chapter
eleven
terrapin
island
kitty
saw
her
father
reading
the
evening
paper
as
brad
brought
her
home
about
nine
o
clock
won
t
you
come
in
she
asked
though
she
knew
her
voice
betrayed
her
weariness
not
tonight
you
ve
had
a
full
day
and
better
get
some
i
am
tired
she
admitted
but
she
felt
a
glow
of
happiness
that
he
was
so
understanding
guess
your
dad
is
sort
of
lonesome
he
ll
want
to
hear
all
about
what
you
ve
been
doing
he
wouldn
t
like
it
kit
if
he
knew
what
chances
you
ve
been
no
i
suppose
not
she
admitted
i
d
better
be
careful
what
i
say
or
he
may
try
to
stop
my
sherlock
holmes
when
she
went
into
the
living
room
her
father
glanced
over
the
top
of
his
paper
enjoy
your
trip
to
the
beach
he
asked
still
somewhat
preoccupied
it
was
wonderful
almost
like
old
she
sat
on
a
footstool
near
him
and
took
off
the
kerchief
that
had
bound
up
her
hair
all
the
girls
had
worn
slacks
and
kerchiefs
for
the
picnic
instead
of
their
canteen
uniforms
a
boat
s
been
sunk
offshore
the
beach
was
full
of
yes
one
went
down
not
far
from
here
i
had
no
idea
so
many
were
still
being
far
more
than
get
into
the
one
of
the
boys
told
us
about
them
capturing
a
sub
that
had
fresh
bread
on
it
from
bayshore
bakery
that
seems
incredible
her
father
let
his
paper
slide
to
his
lap
and
reached
for
his
pipe
oh
they
re
getting
supplies
all
the
gasoline
and
many
other
things
no
can
t
they
put
a
stop
to
it
not
as
long
as
weak
human
beings
can
be
bribed
by
the
glint
of
and
for
other
reasons
too
do
you
suppose
any
men
are
in
our
army
and
navy
who
are
agents
of
the
nazis
and
japs
certainly
not
kit
her
father
answered
then
added
a
bit
dubiously
well
i
suppose
it
could
happen
in
an
organization
as
large
and
as
rapidly
built
as
this
one
might
slip
through
but
you
may
be
sure
they
would
not
stay
long
for
with
our
intelligence
service
their
activities
would
soon
be
brought
to
but
sometimes
even
high
officials
are
new
men
haven
t
been
in
the
doctors
they
kitty
was
thinking
definitely
of
lieutenant
cary
but
didn
t
mention
his
name
yes
of
course
they
have
to
give
a
man
of
that
caliber
a
and
right
away
they
re
put
into
positions
of
authority
where
they
can
help
the
enemy
if
they
ve
a
mind
yes
of
course
but
as
i
said
they
soon
show
their
her
father
paused
his
match
halfway
to
his
pipe
as
he
looked
at
her
searchingly
but
why
all
this
interest
in
such
things
kitten
you
ve
become
a
walking
oh
the
talk
you
pick
up
makes
you
wonder
about
lots
of
things
she
replied
evasively
after
i
asked
you
this
morning
about
the
disposal
of
the
waste
i
got
to
wondering
what
they
do
with
all
the
food
her
father
looked
surprised
at
such
a
question
and
repeated
food
scraps
i
often
see
the
ward
boys
dumping
food
left
by
the
patients
into
big
oh
that
it
s
contracted
for
by
a
cattleman
beeson
i
believe
his
name
is
he
lives
on
terrapin
island
and
uses
the
waste
to
feed
his
next
morning
brad
came
by
to
go
to
church
with
kitty
as
they
were
walking
home
together
she
asked
brad
do
you
know
where
terrapin
island
is
no
but
i
can
find
out
up
at
the
hospital
they
have
some
very
fine
detailed
maps
of
every
island
and
inlet
along
this
soundings
too
and
water
depths
i
should
think
so
i
never
studied
them
closely
they
were
done
by
some
boys
over
at
the
marine
who
used
to
work
for
the
coast
geodetic
wish
i
could
have
a
look
at
might
stir
up
some
comment
kit
no
use
to
lay
ourselves
open
to
no
of
course
what
did
you
want
to
look
up
specially
i
was
wondering
yesterday
when
i
went
exploring
if
that
inlet
flowing
around
the
south
end
of
that
island
is
deep
enough
to
float
a
brad
laughed
you
can
put
that
worry
out
of
your
mind
kit
any
inlet
along
this
coast
that
s
deep
enough
to
float
a
sub
is
thoroughly
guarded
and
protected
by
netting
at
the
sea
water
of
but
that
s
no
assurance
that
small
rubber
boats
can
t
come
in
for
oh
no
nor
that
traitors
from
our
shores
can
t
slip
out
to
waiting
subs
and
of
course
we
know
that
s
being
done
all
the
brad
wouldn
t
it
be
wonderful
if
you
and
i
could
do
something
to
nip
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
bud
kit
don
t
be
too
sure
we
can
do
anything
about
it
we
re
dealing
with
clever
crooks
with
devilishly
keen
a
few
minutes
later
when
brad
paused
at
kitty
s
door
she
said
can
t
you
come
in
and
have
dinner
with
us
jane
always
fixes
something
a
little
extra
because
dad
eats
dinner
with
us
at
noon
on
you
re
a
peach
kit
it
really
would
feel
good
to
stick
my
feet
under
a
home
table
once
carter
made
brad
welcome
while
kitty
went
back
to
have
jane
set
an
extra
place
at
the
table
they
were
half
through
dinner
when
billy
said
dad
let
s
go
boat
riding
you
promised
to
take
me
some
so
you
did
dad
as
soon
as
the
weather
was
mild
enough
it
couldn
t
be
a
more
perfect
day
to
get
carter
glanced
at
brad
and
said
they
forget
a
war
s
on
and
we
have
to
use
gasoline
what
s
wrong
with
a
bit
of
rowing
suggested
brad
a
little
exercise
like
that
would
do
me
wouldn
t
do
me
any
harm
either
agreed
carter
i
sit
in
my
office
so
much
my
muscles
are
getting
how
about
asking
hazel
kitty
suggested
she
s
been
wanting
to
explore
these
marshes
a
long
a
brilliant
idea
kitten
her
father
showed
real
interest
now
we
can
catch
the
rising
tide
up
into
the
marshes
and
come
back
when
it
brad
laughed
that
method
will
certainly
be
much
easier
on
the
hazel
had
the
day
off
and
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
spending
the
afternoon
out
in
the
sunshine
tell
her
i
ll
call
for
her
at
carter
told
kitty
as
she
phoned
that
ll
give
me
half
an
hour
to
run
up
to
the
hospital
said
brad
there
is
something
i
must
attend
to
up
there
before
i
then
i
ll
have
time
to
pack
some
sandwiches
and
cookies
so
we
can
eat
our
supper
another
brilliant
idea
said
her
father
we
ll
make
an
afternoon
of
that
will
give
jane
the
whole
afternoon
off
she
needs
a
rest
said
kitty
as
she
hurried
out
to
the
kitchen
to
see
what
she
could
prepare
on
such
short
notice
there
was
a
long
loaf
of
bayshore
bakery
bread
that
hadn
t
been
opened
while
she
made
chicken
sandwiches
from
dinner
she
thought
how
strange
it
seemed
to
be
eating
bread
from
the
same
bakery
as
that
eaten
by
the
nazis
off
shore
as
she
worked
she
wondered
also
what
had
taken
brad
back
to
the
hospital
her
father
had
already
left
in
his
car
to
bring
hazel
from
the
hospital
when
brad
came
back
and
bolted
on
into
the
pantry
i
made
a
little
sketch
from
that
big
map
he
told
kitty
so
that
s
what
you
went
for
thought
we
might
have
a
chance
to
look
up
terrapin
island
while
we
re
out
he
said
come
let
me
show
he
spread
a
hasty
sketch
on
the
table
i
ve
been
wondering
if
terrapin
island
is
near
the
place
where
they
burn
the
hospital
it
s
the
very
next
island
see
brad
traced
with
his
finger
the
inlet
that
swung
southwest
around
palmetto
island
and
farther
south
separated
terrapin
island
from
its
neighbor
which
they
discovered
was
called
mangrove
island
two
hours
later
the
picnickers
came
ashore
on
an
island
covered
with
virgin
pines
by
subtle
suggestions
kitty
and
brad
had
succeeded
in
heading
their
expedition
toward
the
goal
they
had
in
mind
carter
and
hazel
had
no
particular
purpose
but
to
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
bracing
air
and
so
were
amenable
to
suggestions
kitty
and
hazel
insisted
on
doing
their
share
of
the
rowing
so
the
trip
was
easy
for
all
billy
was
hilarious
when
they
climbed
up
the
bank
to
a
deep
carpet
of
pine
needles
under
the
towering
trees
oh
daddy
let
s
stay
here
a
long
time
and
play
he
exclaimed
we
can
stay
two
whole
hours
before
we
start
back
that
s
a
very
long
i
never
saw
such
magnificent
trees
said
hazel
her
eyes
turned
here
and
there
as
if
she
could
not
take
in
enough
of
the
beauty
and
smell
the
fragrance
of
the
sun
on
the
pine
needles
said
kitty
a
wise
old
hindu
told
me
once
that
man
can
gain
renewed
vitality
in
a
pine
grove
quicker
than
anywhere
else
carter
told
them
then
anybody
ought
to
live
forever
here
said
brad
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
such
a
virgin
forest
there
was
very
little
underbrush
just
the
towering
pines
rising
from
their
thick
carpet
of
brown
needles
their
green
tops
nodding
against
a
blue
sky
with
a
sweet
sighing
in
the
gentle
breeze
this
carpet
of
brown
needles
doesn
t
look
as
though
a
human
foot
had
been
set
here
for
half
a
century
remarked
kitty
they
re
protected
from
the
sea
winds
by
that
island
to
the
east
said
carter
as
he
glanced
that
way
his
expression
changed
i
do
believe
we
ve
landed
behind
the
island
where
they
burn
the
hospital
brad
glanced
at
kitty
but
neither
admitted
that
this
was
where
they
wanted
to
land
billy
picked
up
a
branch
for
a
gun
and
began
to
play
indian
do
you
think
this
is
really
terrapin
island
kitty
asked
in
a
low
tone
when
she
and
brad
strolled
off
toward
the
eastern
shore
he
took
out
his
little
map
and
they
studied
it
can
t
be
any
other
he
said
there
re
smoke
smudges
yonder
must
be
the
dump
heap
we
re
directly
west
of
but
there
s
no
sign
of
a
hog
range
the
map
indicates
it
s
a
rather
large
island
compared
with
many
others
round
here
the
hogs
may
be
at
the
other
end
these
islands
are
often
broken
up
by
low
lands
that
fill
at
high
brad
do
you
suppose
this
beeson
could
be
helping
get
stuff
to
the
german
subs
too
it
all
looks
very
suspicious
to
me
kit
here
he
is
living
right
next
to
where
the
dump
is
we
have
every
reason
to
doubt
punaro
s
loyalty
he
s
obliged
to
have
dealings
with
this
hog
raiser
when
he
comes
to
get
the
stuff
from
the
galley
you
can
t
help
judging
people
by
those
they
re
closely
associated
billy
trailed
after
them
as
they
picked
their
way
along
the
eastern
shore
to
the
island
on
this
side
there
was
a
low
bluff
kitty
glanced
back
to
note
that
her
father
and
hazel
were
sitting
under
a
pine
in
sight
of
their
boat
she
and
brad
continued
tramping
down
the
eastern
shore
when
they
had
gone
about
a
half
mile
they
saw
an
old
negro
fishing
from
the
bluff
on
knees
he
got
to
his
feet
as
they
approached
howdy
he
said
with
the
genuine
courtesy
of
the
old
southern
negro
y
all
lookin
fer
somebody
oh
no
said
brad
we
just
came
out
here
on
a
little
boat
ride
and
for
a
picnic
the
old
man
took
off
his
battered
felt
and
scratched
his
woolly
head
reckon
y
all
bettah
go
some
ers
else
to
eat
yo
suppah
massa
don
like
nobody
in
the
pine
grove
reckon
you
see
dem
sign
he
stick
they
had
noticed
no
trespassing
signs
but
kitty
had
thought
that
applied
to
hunting
and
fishing
we
aren
t
doing
a
bit
of
harm
kitty
told
the
old
man
the
trees
are
so
beautiful
there

no
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
enjoy

m
dat

thought
the
old
man
looked
to
be
eighty
or
ninety
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
deeply
sunken
in
his
wrinkled
dusty
brown
face
while
his
frame
had
little
padding
left
on
the
bones
it
was
nice
of
beeson
to

nice
just
to
pick
him
i
warmed
to
him
the
minute
i
saw
him
he
s
the
real
you
bet
suddenly
kitty
stopped
short
and
exclaimed
alarm
in
her
tone
brad
where
s
billy
why
i
d
forgotten
about
him
i
did
too
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
long
before
we
met
the
old
kitty
ran
ahead
into
the
pine
grove
calling
billy
billy
where
are
you
chapter
twelve
the
lookout
kitty
had
never
felt
so
in
her
life
as
when
she
found
billy
was
lost
maybe
he
went
back
and
joined
your
father
and
miss
dawson
brad
suggested
i
don
t
think
so
we
d
come
too
far
he
trailed
us
all
the
way
pretending
to
be
shooting
at
us
from
behind
trees
oh
brad
do
you
suppose
he
fell
from
that
bluff
into
the
water
but
he
can
swim
like
a
you
go
along
the
bluff
and
i
ll
go
through
the
thicket
she
directed
she
ran
from
him
darting
here
and
there
calling
frantically
if
anything
had
happened
to
billy
she
would
never
forgive
herself
for
being
so
preoccupied
with
this
strange
puzzle
she
and
brad
were
trying
to
work
out
suddenly
she
stopped
short
under
the
towering
pines
tears
streaming
down
her
eyes
oh
billy
darling
where
are
you
she
wailed
kitty
will
die
if
anything
has
happened
to
suddenly
she
caught
the
queer
little
noise
he
made
in
his
throat
when
pretending
to
fire
a
machine
gun
at
her
she
glanced
around
startled
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
that
must
have
been
something
she
heard
because
she
so
wanted
to
hear
it
billy
are
you
she
called
almost
desperately
again
there
came
the
playful
sound
and
this
time
kitty
thought
it
was
overhead
she
must
be
having
hallucinations
surely
hopefully
she
moved
in
the
direction
from
which
she
thought
the
sound
had
come
suddenly
a
cone
fell
almost
at
her
feet
then
there
was
a
burst
of
childish
laughter
from
the
nearest
treetop
she
looked
up
to
see
a
mischievous
face
peering
down
at
her
from
the
high
branches
her
overwhelming
relief
was
only
momentary
for
it
was
followed
by
terror
lest
billy
break
his
neck
why
billy
carter
how
in
the
world
did
you
climb
that
tall
pine
it
was
easy
come
up
kit
you
can
see
clear
across
the
i
m
not
coming
up
and
you
re
coming
down
this
very
instant
she
said
firmly
it
s
fun
up
here
let
me
stay
pleaded
billy
kitty
saw
brad
running
toward
them
attracted
by
their
voices
oh
look
at
him
in
the
top
of
that
pine
she
told
brad
how
will
he
ever
get
down
i
can
get
down
stated
billy
unexpectedly
willing
to
show
them
the
wonderful
feat
with
the
agility
of
a
little
monkey
he
swung
through
the
branches
that
crowned
the
towering
column
of
rusty
brown
kitty
s
hands
were
clenched
agonizingly
as
he
reached
the
smooth
trunk
which
had
no
supporting
branches
oh
dear
god
bring
him
down
safely
she
prayed
seeing
brad
take
a
step
toward
the
tree
she
whispered
don
t
speak
to
him
or
make
him
then
they
saw
an
amazing
thing
billy
s
feet
were
seeking
small
niches
cut
in
the
trunk
and
his
hands
holding
to
something
that
hugged
the
bark
i
do
believe
there
is
wire
wrapped
all
the
way
up
that
trunk
whispered
brad
noting
that
she
had
seen
it
too
put
there
so
somebody
could
climb
up
and
down
that
tree
easily
added
kitty
but
at
the
moment
she
did
not
stop
to
realize
how
significant
it
might
be
she
was
too
grateful
to
know
it
was
there
to
make
billy
s
descent
less
dangerous
thirty
feet
above
the
ground
the
sturdy
limbs
of
a
young
oak
spread
around
the
pine
trunk
billy
stepped
lightly
to
those
limbs
and
a
few
minutes
later
had
scrambled
safely
to
the
ground
kitty
caught
him
to
her
moaning
oh
billy
darling
you
might
have
broken
your
neck
never
do
such
a
thing
huh
he
grunted
resenting
being
made
a
baby
it
was
climbing
our
old
magnolia
back
in
n
orleans
aunt
nina
let
me
play
up
there
any
i
m
afraid
aunt
nina
spoiled
you
billy
stepped
back
and
surveyed
the
tree
with
a
proud
air
i
never
went
so
high
before
you
can
see
the
ocean
off
he
swung
his
arm
seaward
with
a
grandiose
air
the
hospital
too
there
was
even
a
seat
to
sit
a
seat
exclaimed
brad
you
mean
boards
nailed
across
the
limbs
to
make
a
seat
billy
nodded
i
sat
on
it
the
wind
swings
the
top
it
was
fun
i
was
a
bird
up
there
kitty
i
m
going
up
brad
said
with
sudden
decision
somebody
has
a
lookout
oh
the
very
idea
seemed
to
take
kitty
s
breath
away
a
moment
later
brad
was
scaling
the
tree
by
the
route
billy
had
taken
he
can
climb
most
as
good
as
me
boasted
billy
i
m
going
up
indeed
you
re
not
you
re
never
going
to
climb
such
a
high
tree
while
billy
picked
up
his
imaginary
gun
once
more
and
played
at
shooting
them
kitty
s
mind
was
in
turmoil
finding
this
tree
lookout
was
certainly
a
sequel
to
what
uncle
mose
had
told
them
it
seemed
quite
obvious
that
the
man
who
had
leased
terrapin
island
wanted
to
be
sure
that
this
end
of
the
estate
was
kept
entirely
private
even
to
the
extent
of
moving
an
ignorant
old
negro
from
his
home
can
you
see
very
far
she
asked
when
brad
reached
the
top
plenty
the
highest
lookout
that
could
be
found
in
the
entire
kitty
felt
sure
he
must
be
right
for
the
ancient
pine
looked
to
be
the
father
of
all
the
pines
in
the
entire
thicket
when
brad
again
stood
beside
her
on
the
cushiony
brown
carpet
of
needles
he
said
kitty
that
wire
has
been
strung
up
there
how
do
you
know
it
s
still
loose
and
not
embedded
in
the
trunk
you
must
be
right
even
wisteria
vines
growing
around
pine
trunks
soon
press
tightly
into
kitty
i
m
sure
glad
we
headed
for
this
you
re
telling
me
the
minute
dad
told
me
beeson
came
over
to
the
hospital
to
haul
stuff
off
for
his
swine
i
thought
he
might
be
mixed
up
in
the
dirty
evidence
is
piling
up
bit
by
looks
as
though
we
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
em
to
justice
sometime
but
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
kit
we
haven
t
got
a
single
thing
that
would
really
convict
anybody
of
she
looked
puzzled
and
distressed
that
s
true
she
had
to
admit
just
because
some
bayshore
bakery
bread
was
found
on
that
sub
and
because
we
saw
a
box
on
a
trash
barge
doesn
t
prove
anything
about
who
and
just
because
there
s
an
easy
way
to
climb
this
pine
that
has
a
seat
at
the
top
doesn
t
prove
that
anybody
on
this
island
is
a
of
course
boys
have
been
building
seats
in
trees
for
hundreds
of
years
maybe
it
was
old
uncle
mose
s
young
massa
when
he
was
last
not
very
likely
that
seat
was
put
up
there
so
recently
that
the
nails
aren
t
even
you
know
that
doesn
t
take
long
in
this
salty
air
and
what
s
more
there
s
a
boarded
up
shield
on
the
side
toward
the
marine
base
it
s
so
cleverly
camouflaged
you
d
hardly
know
it
from
the
only
after
brad
pointed
it
out
did
kitty
see
the
brown
painted
wood
in
the
thick
upper
branches
if
they
are
using
light
signals
for
subs
out
at
sea
the
coast
guard
would
surely
see
them
from
the
beach
said
kitty
they
probably
don
t
use
lights
but
some
other
signal
they
walked
slowly
toward
their
landing
place
and
kitty
let
billy
run
ahead
to
join
her
father
and
hazel
he
can
hardly
wait
to
tell
them
about
climbing
the
pine
brad
said
we
can
t
keep
him
from
telling
that
said
kitty
but
let
s
not
mention
how
significant
that
pine
seems
m
afraid
dad
may
forbid
my
nosing
about
i
think
he
already
has
an
idea
i
m
up
to
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
he
did
forbid
your
nosing
about
kitty
said
brad
unexpectedly
no
sense
in
your
taking
chances
of
coming
out
here
to
the
marshes
alone
as
you
did
oh
i
won
t
do
that
again
she
promised
now
that
i
know
there
s
real
danger
but
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
brad
i
have
an
awful
feeling
that
somehow
dad
s
good
name
may
be
at
stake
in
the
dirty
business
that
s
going
you
re
not
alone
in
wondering
about
you
know
hazel
dawson
let
it
slip
out
the
other
day
that
dad
asked
for
this
appointment
and
she
practically
admitted
that
she
asked
to
be
sent
here
too
i
know
now
that
dad
and
hazel
are
old
friends
and
are
pulling
together
with
one
to
clear
chief
pharmacist
s
mate
exactly
said
kitty
and
if
the
same
complications
still
exist
my
own
dear
dad
may
get
in
they
were
too
near
the
others
now
for
further
discussion
as
they
joined
the
older
couple
carter
said
you
must
have
taken
a
long
we
really
did
kitty
told
him
billy
has
been
telling
us
about
his
tree
he
almost
scared
the
life
out
of
me
kitty
reported
dad
you
ll
really
have
to
scold
him
again
about
this
tree
however
she
wanted
to
change
the
subject
as
quickly
as
possible
and
said
let
s
eat
i
m
she
had
brought
a
luncheon
cloth
which
they
spread
on
the
clean
pine
needles
brad
poured
the
iced
tea
from
their
thermos
jug
while
she
set
out
the
sandwiches
cold
ham
rolls
pickles
and
cookies
food
had
never
tasted
quite
so
good
to
kitty
as
they
ate
the
pines
made
soft
music
in
the
gentle
breeze
while
the
lowering
sun
painted
long
shadows
on
the
woodland
carpet
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
any
evil
deed
could
be
done
in
so
beautiful
a
spot
and
that
beyond
these
peaceful
shores
a
world
was
in
chaos
because
of
such
intrigue
everywhere
chapter
thirteen
a
dream
comes
true
on
monday
morning
evans
called
kitty
to
know
if
she
could
go
over
to
bayport
as
they
were
short
of
workers
for
special
canteen
duty
sure
i
ll
be
delighted
she
said
promptly
what
time
shall
i
report
eleven
o
i
ll
be
on
the
spot
i
m
scheduled
for
down
at
the
snack
bar
tonight
do
you
think
i
should
be
back
from
bayport
in
time
for
that
oh
sure
it
won
t
take
long
for
the
job
over
not
until
kitty
put
down
the
phone
did
she
remember
that
it
was
monday
her
busiest
day
at
home
while
jane
did
the
weekly
washing
she
always
looked
after
the
lunch
and
household
work
instantly
she
decided
to
switch
days
on
the
housework
for
she
had
made
up
her
mind
never
to
refuse
a
canteen
call
if
she
could
possibly
serve
so
at
ten
minutes
of
eleven
she
walked
into
the
bayport
canteen
she
found
that
vera
parsons
had
already
come
over
from
the
island
ah
on
the
dot
said
miss
pearson
it
s
grand
to
have
a
few
girls
we
can
depend
on
to
put
aside
personal
interests
for
what
s
cooking
kitty
wanted
to
know
troop
train
coming
through
in
half
an
hour
though
we
re
never
quite
sure
of
the
time
explained
miss
pearson
the
boys
will
appreciate
some
sandwiches
and
smokes
and
a
little
talk
with
you
kitty
had
met
troop
trains
only
a
couple
of
times
but
she
loved
it
the
boys
were
always
so
full
of
fun
and
so
appreciative
of
any
little
attention
they
didn
t
have
many
troop
trains
through
as
bayport
was
not
on
a
main
line
it
was
really
only
a
small
coast
town
that
had
spread
out
like
a
mushroom
since
war
began
the
small
railroad
station
hadn
t
had
time
to
catch
up
with
the
amazing
growth
of
the
rest
of
the
place
the
trains
rolled
along
open
tracks
beside
an
inadequate
ticket
office
and
waiting
rooms
when
the
girls
packed
into
the
station
wagon
to
drive
over
to
the
station
kitty
found
herself
sitting
beside
janice
who
had
lived
in
the
oyster
cannery
district
before
the
fire
hope
you
found
another
house
kitty
remarked
to
her
indeed
i
have
honey
in
a
better
section
of
town
i
m
so
glad
i
m
sure
the
new
houses
they
build
around
the
cannery
will
be
much
better
than
the
old
they
ain
t
making
no
plans
to
rebuild
the
cannery
till
after
the
war
s
over
but
my
boy
jim
got
a
job
in
the
bayshore
bakery
we
re
living
near
oh
bayshore
bakery
repeated
kitty
without
realizing
that
there
was
a
sort
of
question
mark
in
her
tone
yeah
i
know
all
them
rumors
bout
the
because
they
found
some
of
their
bread
wrappers
on
that
captured
sub
and
how
could
the
bakery
help
that
i
ask
you
no
fault
of
theirs
put
in
beth
gilcrist
one
of
the
town
girls
when
they
sell
bread
they
can
t
be
responsible
for
where
it
of
course
not
my
jim
thinks
they
re
fine
people
at
the
bakery
fair
and
square
and
considerate
of
their
employees
i
can
t
see
where
it
s
any
fault
of
theirs
that
the
germans
were
eating
their
bread
there
s
a
thousand
ways
they
could
have
got
as
they
rode
toward
the
station
kitty
didn
t
doubt
that
she
was
right
there
were
a
thousand
ways
the
germans
might
have
got
that
bread
while
she
and
brad
had
been
optimistic
enough
to
hope
they
could
discover
the
one
way
it
had
been
done
the
girls
were
scarcely
out
of
the
station
wagon
with
their
sandwich
trays
slung
over
their
shoulders
when
they
saw
the
smoke
of
the
troop
train
far
down
the
track
as
if
by
magic
people
suddenly
appeared
from
all
directions
to
see
the
troops
go
through
the
canteen
workers
had
to
do
considerable
elbowing
to
keep
close
enough
to
the
track
to
serve
the
men
they
tried
to
spread
out
so
their
wares
would
be
available
to
all
the
coaches
however
kit
and
beth
found
themselves
side
by
side
as
they
tried
to
keep
the
curious
crowd
from
pushing
them
onto
the
track
suddenly
beth
leaned
close
and
whispered
to
kitty
look
to
your
left
in
a
man
s
been
down
here
to
see
almost
every
troop
train
since
i
ve
been
in
canteen
kitty
glanced
at
the
man
whom
beth
indicated
in
his
hat
and
knee
boots
he
looked
like
a
western
cowhand
while
his
face
was
like
some
granite
rock
rising
out
of
the
mesa
then
in
the
push
she
lost
sight
of
him
she
and
beth
separated
as
the
train
pulled
into
the
station
the
boys
already
had
their
windows
up
and
were
leaning
out
waving
at
the
crowd
calling
greetings
to
the
canteen
girls
many
of
them
had
letters
they
wanted
mailed
eager
hands
reached
down
for
the
sandwiches
and
candy
bars
kitty
offered
they
were
not
supposed
to
ask
where
the
boys
were
going
but
there
was
no
law
against
asking
where
they
had
been
kitty
put
that
question
to
a
chap
who
thanked
her
so
profusely
for
the
sandwich
and
cigarettes
south
pacific
he
replied
carolina
s
home
it
sure
looks
good
to
wish
you
happy
landing
for
a
long
furlough
she
said
with
a
smile
as
she
moved
on
down
the
line
several
handed
her
letters
which
she
put
on
the
tray
where
the
sandwiches
had
been
suddenly
through
the
din
she
heard
someone
call
out
anybody
round
here
ever
heard
of
terrapin
island
kitty
glanced
in
amazement
toward
the
end
of
the
coach
to
see
a
sunburned
soldier
looking
over
the
crowd
as
he
asked
the
question
sure
one
man
said
another
replied
about
twenty
miles
down
the
most
of
them
were
low
country
people
who
were
familiar
with
the
name
of
terrapin
island
even
though
few
had
been
there
kitty
pushed
her
way
closer
to
the
window
from
which
the
questioner
leaned
anybody

old
uncle
mose
a
colored
man
who
s
been
living
there
all
his
life
the
soldier
asked
kitty
could
scarcely
credit
her
hearing
when
he
asked
that
was
it
possible
he
was
the
tradd
boy
just
returned
from
the
pacific
she
was
right
under
his
window
now
as
she
thrust
her
last
sandwich
into
his
hand
she
asked

at
the
the
young
man
reached
down
and
seized
her
hand
eagerly
not
whit
himself
he
said
eagerly
but
his
best

someone
so
soon
who

island
the
soldier
spoke
hurriedly
fearing
the
train
might
pull
out
at
any
moment
uncle
mose
and
terrapin
island
but
not
your
whit
kitty
replied
where

still
in
the
south
pacific
i
d
be
there
too
but
for
a
cracked
ankle
he
added
ruefully
kitty
s
face
showed
her
disappointment
but
he
told
me
if
i
ever
got
to
carolina
i
was
to
try
to
find
out
how
uncle
mose
is
he
s
fine
i
saw
him
yesterday
but
he
s
awful
lonesome
and
wants
to
hear
from
say
this
is
a
bit
of
luck
give
me
whit
s
ordered
kitty
i
promised
uncle
mose

letter
for
him
and
send
it
to
his
young
massa
if
i
could
get
the
address
imagine
meeting
you
and
imagine
meeting
you
the
young
man
took
out
a
card
and
scribbled
an
address
rapidly
on
it
as
he
handed
it
down
to
kitty
he
also
gave
her
a
dollar
take
that
and
buy
the
old
man
some
baccy
for
his
pipe
tell
him
it
s
from
the
train
was
beginning
to
move
now
and
kitty
trotted
along
beside
it
handing
up
the
last
bar
of
chocolate
from
her
tray
what
s
your
name
she
called
kenneth
turner
my
name
and
address

on
back
of
the
card
too
write
and
let
me
know
what
uncle
mose
says
say
what
s
your
name
he
yelled
as
an
when
it
was
almost
too
late
kitty
carter
she
laughingly
called
back
then
with
a
final
wave
he
was
gone
as
he
drew
his
head
inside
the
window
leaving
kitty
rather
dazed
as
she
looked
at
the
card
and
the
dollar
in
her
hand
these
were
positive
proof
that
the
thing
had
really
happened
on
the
way
back
to
the
canteen
kitty
told
the
other
workers
of
her
experience
you
could
never
believe
such
a
thing
as
that
would
happen
why
it
was
only
yesterday
that
i
met
uncle
mose
for
the
first
time
when
we
ate
our
supper
over
on
terrapin
island
it
s
really
a
small
world
after
yeah
real
small
said
vera
sourly
where
everybody
knows
everybody
s
kitty
looked
at
her
friend
feeling
somewhat
taken
aback
but
she
didn
t
ask
what
she
meant
until
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
palmetto
island
on
the
bus
you
seemed
to
forget
that
people
all
around
you
heard
every
word
you
and
that
chap
said
vera
retorted
in
a
rather
severe
tone
well
there
was
nothing
secret
about
maybe
not
but
there
was
one
listener
who
definitely
registered
the
fact
that
you
talked
with
uncle
mose
on
terrapin
island
kitty
felt
the
blood
rising
to
her
cheeks
as
she
realized
that
might
be
significant
that
island
s
posted
all
over
with
no
trespassing
signs
vera
stated
and
the
owner
was
standing
right
there
staring
at
you
and
listening
to
everything
you
not
beeson
of
which
was
he
the
tall
man
in
the
stetson
and
knee
that
man
why
beth
gilcrist
pointed
him
out
to
me
and
told
me
he
meets
all
the
troop
as
soon
as
that
fellow
yelled
out
about
terrapin
island
i
started
over
to
talk
to
him
and
i
saw
beeson
headed
that
way
too
then
after
you
took
the
floor
he
didn
t
open
his
trap
just
stood
there
glaring
at
you
as
if
he
could
kill
you
with
a
oh
how
awful
but
kitty
couldn
t
tell
vera
just
how
awful
it
was
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
she
reached
home
to
find
jane
starting

the
first
time
kitty
was
a
little
late
reaching
the
canteen
but
this
had
been
a
day
when
she
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
with
all
her
obligations
it
was
her
night
for
duty
she
had
little
to
do
until
the
dirty
dishes
began
to
pile
up
so
she
strolled
around
the
hall
talking
to
the
service
men
suddenly
she
noticed
hazel
dawson
at
the
chessboard
and
to
her
amazement
saw
that
chief
krome
sat
opposite
she
strolled
over
and
put
her
hand
caressingly
on
hazel
s
shoulder
how
are
you
progressing
slow
going
i
fear
i
never
tried
to
learn
such
a
complicated
she
s
doing
she
is
stated
krome
he
glanced
up
and
recognized
kitty
oh
it
s
you
did
the
boys
enjoy
that
shrimp
creole
the
other
night
sure
did
thanks
to
the
someone
was
playing
a
brahms
waltz
on
the
piano
and
kitty
hummed
it
softly
sing
it
kitty
dear
those
were
lovely
words
set
to
the
music
that
you
sang
for
me
the
other
night
hazel
said
glancing
up
from
her
board
do
please
kitty
urged
jimmy
barnes
who
stood
near
you
ve
been
promising
to
sing
for
us
a
long
come
ahead
said
brad
catching
her
hand
and
leading
her
toward
the
piano
all
right
if
you
insist
said
kitty
graciously
no
sooner
had
her
rich
voice
swelled
with
the
piano
accompaniment
than
the
entire
hall
fell
silent
everyone
turned
toward
her
to
look
and
listen
entranced
for
a
moment
after
the
last
notes
faded
softly
there
was
a
breathless
hush
then
a
storm
of
applause
more
someone
called
out
give
us
another
a
marine
demanded
kitty
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
sergeant
bradshaw
at
the
piano
laughing
he
began
the
australian
folk
song
that
was
such
a
rage
kitty
sang
the
first
verse
glancing
around
the
room
with
her
flashing
smile
as
the
words
raced
from
her
lips
then
at
the
chorus
she
lifted
her
hands
with
an
impelling
movement
and
said
everybody
instantly
the
room
rocked
with
nonsense
and
rhythm
after
the
storm
subsided
kitty
sang
while
they
clapped
at
the
conclusion
she
ran
off
to
the
canteen
kitchen
ned
miller
was
sent
in
to
drag
her
out
she
thrust
her
head
through
the
doorway
to
call
it
s
my
night
to
wash
we
ll
wash
the
dishes
came
a
chorus
in
retort
against
the
rules
i
ll
sing
another
she
was
flushed
and
buoyantly
happy
when
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
back
toward
the
sink
gosh
you
oughtn
t
to
be
washing
dishes
exclaimed
sally
anybody
with
a
voice
like
that
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
kitty
they
re
badly
in
need
of
dish
washers
and
they
obviously
don
t
need
don
t

burst
forth
judy
why
kitty
they
ought
to
send
you
overseas
to
sing
to
the
boys
behind
the
fighting
don
t
make
fun
of
me
judy
had
really
voiced
a
wish
that
lay
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
kitty
s
heart
to
such
a
career
as
that
her
daydreaming
had
constantly
taken
her
since
war
began
but
its
fulfillment
seemed
beyond
her
wildest
dreams
the
practical
side
of
her
nature
had
tried
to
still
those
high
ambitions
as
she
planned
to
go
first
into
the
waves
and
later
into
canteen
work
you
have
a
way
with
the
boys
that
makes
them
laugh
and
cry
cheer
and
clap
continued
sally
she
sure
has
that
s
the
sort
of
entertainer
they
ought
to
be
thrilled
to
find
added
judy
kitty
didn
t
tell
them
that
a
thousand
times
in
her
daydreaming
she
had
visioned
herself
doing
what
she
had
just
done
it
had
given
her
the
greatest
thrill
she
had
ever
known
when
she
finished
the
dishes
she
had
a
free
interval
until
another
pile
accumulated
so
she
went
outside
to
find
brad
she
was
eager
to
know
what
he
would
think
of
her
experience

jane

asked
kitty

kitty
hurried
past
her
into
billy
s
little
room
he
lay
on
the
bed
his
round
cheeks
red
his
mouth
open
as
he
struggled
for
breath
in
a
moment
she
was
sitting
on
the
bed
bending
over
him
where
do
you
feel
bad
darling
his
little
hand
went
to
his
throat
terrified
she
thought
of
diphtheria
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
you

bad
before
i
went

she
chided
he
only
moaned
and

throat
said
brad
as
soon
as
i
wash
my
get
him
a
fresh
towel
kitty
turned
the
bedside
lamp
on
the
flushed
little
face
when
brad
came
back
she
had
already
sent
for
a
spoon
to
hold
his
tongue
down
after
one
glance
inside
that
swollen
throat
brad
said
um
badly
inflamed
we
ve
got
to
do
something
about
he
and
kitty
exchanged
anxious
glances
they
heard
steps
running
up
the
porch
and
a
moment
later
carter
was
with
them
kitty
met
him
at
the
door
to
whisper
his
throat
oh
dad
i
m
so
afraid
of
diphtheria
before
going
near
the
boy
carter
went
to
the
bathroom
to
wash
up
after
a
careful
inspection
of
the
throat
he
drew
kitty
aside
do
you
think
it
is
she
asked
can
t
tell
i
m
going
to
take
him
straight
up
to
the
hospital
we
ll
soon
know
there
you
get
out
the
car
while
i
bundle
him
i
ll
drive
you
over
offered
brad
i
have
bud
wilson
s
car
out
kitty
wrapped
billy
in
a
warm
blanket
so
that
only
his
nose
was
exposed
they
closed
all
the
car
windows
and
kitty
sat
in
the
back
while
her
father
held
the
child
on
the
front
seat
beside
brad
she
wondered
contritely
why
this
had
to
happen
when
she
had
left
her
brother
practically
all
day
maybe
if
she
had
been
home
she
would
have
noticed
that
he
was
ill
earlier
carter
was
allowed
to
stay
in
the
room
with
billy
while
fletcher
examined
him
in
the
meantime
brad
paced
the
hall
with
kitty
i
ll
never
forgive
myself
for
leaving
him
so
much
today
if
there
s
anything
i
could
have
done
to
prevent
this
kitty
said
accusingly
that
s
silly
kit
no
sense
in
blaming
yourself
you
know
how
kids
are
they
almost
always
come
down
sudden
like
do
they
she
glanced
hopefully
at
him
through
eyes
of
course
i
can
remember
how
i
used
to
play
till
i
dropped
and
in
an
hour
or
so
would
be
burning
with
illustration
moaned
and
tossed
but
suppose
it
s
diphtheria
they
can
die
in
a
few
hours
of
not
in
these
times
with
all
the
new
treatment
that
knocks
things
out
in
no
they
were
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
when
kitty
saw
hazel
dawson
go
into
the
room
oh
i
hope
they
ll
let
hazel
nurse
him
she
said
then
i
ll
be
sure
everything
s
being
done
for
him
that
possibly
can
be
they
probably
how
long
will
it
take
for
them
to
find
out
what
it
is
not
long
chief
carter
will
see
to
at
that
very
moment
a
interne
came
out
of
the
room
followed
by
carter
they
hurried
off
toward
the
laboratory
the
door
stood
slightly
ajar
when
kitty
and
brad
came
nearer
kitty
saw
hazel
inside
and
motioned
to
her
may
i
come
in
now
she
whispered
he
s
already
sleeping
perhaps
you
d
better
not
till
we
find
out
what
it
will
it
take
long
no
not
with
your
father
around
to
see
that
everything
is
speeded
are
you
going
to
nurse
him
yes
i
m
glad
to
say
your
father
asked
for
i
m
so
thankful
now
i
ll
know
he
has
the
best
of
care
oh
hazel
i
ll
never
forgive
myself
kitty
couldn
t
go
on
and
hazel
put
an
arm
around
her
waist
then
she
turned
to
brad
to
say
i
think
you
d
better
take
her
home

ll
see
to
everything
i
couldn
t
possibly

know
what
it

how
i
feel
i
was
away
from
him
practically
all
day
maybe
if
i
d
put
him
to
bed
myself
i
would
have
touched
him
and
found
he
had
a
don
t
be
absurd
kitty
said
hazel
almost
severely
you
couldn
t
have
prevented
his
picking
up
some
germ
stop
blaming
yourself
for
what
can
t
be
i
know
you
re
only
trying
to
make
me
feel
better
about
it
said
kitty
wiping
her
tears
with
a
large
handkerchief
which
brad
had
thrust
into
her
hands
that
s
right
dry
your
tears
you
know
men
don
t
like
to
see
a
woman
cry
hazel
reminded
her
kitty
smiled
brad
s
been
awful
us
keep
it
up
a
little
longer
young
man
hazel
directed
you
and
kitty
can
wait
in
the
sun
parlor
until
they
bring
back
the
report
then
i
ll
get
carter
to
look
you
up
and
let
you
know
what
the
trouble
kitty
was
glad
to
obey
these
instructions
brad
found
some
pictorial
magazines
and
they
sat
on
the
couch
turning
the
pages
for
there
seemed
nothing
they
could
say
while
they
waited
kitty
saw
little
of
what
was
on
those
printed
pages
her
ears
were
too
alert
for
a
familiar
step
in
the
hall
how
easy
it
is
to
take
all
the
good
things
of
life
for
granted
until
something
like
this
comes
along
she
thought
ambition
had
been
eternally
prodding
her
to
conquer
new
worlds
when
within
the
four
walls
of
her
own
home
there
should
have
been
happiness
enough
to
fill
their
three
hearts
to
overflowing
she
tried
to
tell
brad
something
of
what
she
was
thinking
but
your
desire
to
help
in
canteen
work
or
any
war
work
is
no
reason
why
you
should
blame
yourself
for
neglecting
billy
brad
said
as
he
tried
to
make
her
see
straight
i
course
she
brushed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
and
back
over
her
forehead
that
s
something
we
ve
all
got
to
man
and
woman
in
the
there
won
t
be
any
homes
left
for
us
to
be
happy
you
re
so
sensible
it
s
such
a
comfort
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
sit
here
with
me
gosh
i
haven
t
done
anything
just
then
kitty
heard
the
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
jumped
up
fortunately
they
had
the
sun
parlor
to
themselves
all
other
visitors
had
long
since
gone
home
her
father
s
face
told
her
at
once
that
the
situation
was
better
than
they
feared
a
strep
infection
he
said
in
answer
to
her
eager
question
we
ll
soon
knock
that
out
with
the
sulfa
what
a
relief
i
think
i
would
have
died
had
it
been
anything
that
s
bad
enough
if
not
caught
in
time
her
father
stated
how
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
he
got
it
there
s
been
a
lot
of
it
here
at
the
but
i
never
bring
billy
to
the
he
could
have
picked
it
up
almost
then
with
an
appalling
recollection
kitty
saw
herself
and
billy
in
their
boat
going
past
that
hospital
dump
in
the
marshes
that
was
where
he
had
got
the
germ
she
was
positive
subconsciously
she
had
known
it
from
the
very
beginning
that
s
why
she
had
felt
so
stunned
by
billy
s
sickness
now
that
she
honestly
faced
the
results
of
her
own
carelessness
she
felt
she
couldn
t
endure
it
noting
her
pale
face
and
the
misery
in
her
eyes
carter
said
brad
please
take
her
home
for
i
couldn
t
leave
till
i
know
billy
s
going
to
be
all
right
you
can
do
absolutely
nothing
here
kitty
her
father
said
almost
severely
he
s
in
most
competent
hands
hazel
s
going
to
nurse
him
and
i
plan
to
stay
on
for
the
night
i
have
my
own
room
i
can
use
any
time
i
ll
see
that
everything
possible
is
done
it
will
be
a
relief
to
me
to
know
you
re
home
in
kitty
felt
she
could
never
sleep
again
but
said
in
a
resigned
tone
all
right
dad
i
ll
seeing
her
so
crushed
he
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulder
and
went
with
her
down
the
hall
go
home
and
take
a
hot
bath
to
calm
your
nerves
and
get
right
into
bed
i
ll
phone
you
at
six
in
the
that
night
as
kitty
tossed
about
sleepless
for
several
hours
she
made
up
her
mind
that
if
billy
recovered
she
would
tell
her
father
everything
that
had
happened
these
last
weeks
to
stir
her
suspicions
she
blamed
herself
for
her
pride
and
conceit
in
hoping
she
alone
could
find
an
answer
to
those
problems
that
were
continually
stumping
the
fbi
she
thought
bitterly
of
what
her
psychology
teacher
had
once
said
we
re
very
complicated
creatures
and
how
we
sometimes
hate
to
face
the
and
another
time
he
had
talked
to
their
class
about
how
human
beings
compensate
for
losses
and
disappointments
yes
that
was
exactly
what
she
was
trying
to
do
in
making
herself
a
private
agent
she
imagined
she
could
do
something
big
enough
in
uncovering
some
dastardly
plot
against
her
country
this
would
compensate
for
her
not
being
able
to
do
more
to
help
the
war
effort
the
fact
that
billy
had
been
her
stumbling
block
all
along
even
though
she
adored
him
made
her
feel
all
the
more
miserable
now
that
his
safety
was
involved
it
was
late
when
her
tired
body
and
tortured
mind
succumbed
to
weariness
and
she
slept
she
slept
so
heavily
then
she
didn
t
even
rouse
for
the
anticipated
phone
call
at
six
o
clock
jane
was
in
the
room
when
she
opened
her
eyes
then
sat
up
suddenly
ashamed
that
she
had
overslept
has
dad
phoned
jane
s
kindly
face
told
her
that
he
had
and
that
the
news
was
good
yas
m
sho
did
billy
s
bettah
an
yo
pah
say
you
kin
come
see
kitty
scarcely
had
patience
to
eat
her
breakfast
which
jane
insisted
she
must
have
before
she
left
even
with
that
delay
she
was
at
the
hospital
in
an
hour
after
waking
it
was
good
to
see
her
father
smiling
a
welcome
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
to
see
billy
drinking
some
milk
through
a
tube
while
the
day
nurse
held
a
glass
near
his
pillow
oh
darling
you
do
look
better
she
said
eagerly
i
m
all
right
kit
i
like
it
at
the
kit
s
going
to
stay
with
you
while
daddy
gets
some
she
turned
to
her
father
and
added
you
must
go
home
and
sleep
some
his
hollow
eyes
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
had
been
up
all
night
i
ve
had
breakfast
but
bed
will
be
very
welcome
if
billy
s
very
good
today
maybe
we
ll
take
him
home
tomorrow
that
new
bike
will
be
waiting
if
he
takes
his
medicine
well
and
gets
strong
in
a
i
ll
be
a
good
boy
dad
billy
promised
kitty
spent
the
day
at
the
hospital
and
didn
t
go
home
until
hazel
came
in
on
night
duty
her
father
had
gone
to
his
office
in
the
early
afternoon
but
he
also
was
ready
to
go
home
as
kitty
left
she
was
very
tired
but
so
relieved
that
billy
was
getting
well
that
nothing
else
mattered
as
they
walked
home
in
the
twilight
she
could
still
feel
her
father
s
depression
when
they
had
gone
a
block
in
silence
she
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
asked
what
s
wrong
dad
billy
s
going
to
be
all
right
isn
t
he
oh
yes
yes
indeed
his
throat
has
cleared
up
remarkably
but
you
re
still
worried
about
i
m
afraid
i
am
kitten
it
s
not
a
new
worry
by
any
means
things
are
rather
messed
up
at
the
hospital
in
connection
with
my
what
do
you
mean
dad
i
ve
felt
for
a
long
time
that
something
was
i
haven
t
wanted
to
worry
you
but
if
you
must
know
there
s
a
shortage
leak
that
i
can
t
oh
the
inspector
s
coming
next
her
father
s
tone
was
bitter
i
wouldn
t
want
to
follow
dawson
to
santiago
or
somewhere
else
equally
as
chapter
fifteen
a
confession
kitty
waited
until
her
father
had
eaten
dinner
before
bringing
up
the
subject
that
had
weighed
on
her
mind
since
the
previous
evening
she
knew
she
would
have
no
peace
until
she
had
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
thing
when
her
father
was
in
his
big
chair
in
the
living
room
she
sank
on
the
couch
near
by
dad
how
long
does
it
take
a
a
strep
develop
after
a
person
gets
infected
she
asked
two
or
three
days
sometimes
sooner
we
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
such
then
it
s
all
my
fault
that
billy
s
your
fault
carter
dropped
the
paper
he
had
just
picked
up
i
thoughtlessly
took
him
where
there
re
plenty
of
germs
was
so
intent
on
something
i
wanted
to
find
out
i
didn
t
even
think
of
the
what
are
you
talking
about
kitty
it
s
absurd
blaming
yourself
for
his
illness
you
ve
taken
excellent
care
of
him
ever
since
you
came
from
but
dad
we
went
out
into
the
marshes
where
they
dump
the
hospital
her
father
stared
at
her
shocked
then
she
could
see
by
his
expression
that
he
was
recalling
their
conversation
about
the
disposal
of
the
hospital
waste
that
s
why
i
asked
you
where
they
dumped
it
i
went
there
saturday
you
and
billy
alone
she
nodded
but
i
had
a
good
reason
for
wanting
to
go
dad
a
very
good
he
looked
puzzled
but
his
tone
was
not
unkind
when
he
said
i
can
t
imagine
any
reason
that
would
take
a
sensitive
girl
like
you
out
to
a
dump
i
know
you
think
i
m
crazy
but
it
s
a
long
story
and
i
ll
have
to
start
at
the
well
sit
back
calmly
and
stop
twisting
that
kitty
tossed
the
pillow
to
the
other
end
of
the
couch
and
burst
into
tears
oh
dad
i
ve
been
so
miserable
for
the
last
hours
i
could
die
it
s
all
because
i
m
too
proud
i
wanted
to
do
something
big
for
my
spectacular
i
ve
let
it
make
me
indifferent
to
everything
you
re
doing
what
you
can
kitten
in
your
canteen
yes
i
love
that
but
i
wanted
to
do
even
more
i
thought
i
could
uncover
the
work
of
some
saboteurs
tried
even
to
keep
it
all
from
you
to
do
it
all
myself
that
is
brad
and
kitty
calm
yourself
her
father
said
almost
severely
you
re
being
very
incoherent
tell
me
what
all
this
is
i
hardly
know
where
to
start
to
make
you
understand
why
i
ve
been
so
secret
about
the
place
to
start
is
at
the
beginning
i
suppose
all
this
has
happened
since
you
came
home
from
yes
of
course
in
fact
the
very
day
i
decided
to
go
into
canteen
then
she
told
him
of
her
experience
in
the
launch
when
she
had
introduced
hazel
and
lieutenant
cary
that
was
the
first
hint
i
had
that
something
was
wrong
somewhere
brad
was
with
me
and
in
on
it
from
the
very
so
you
ve
been
suspicious
of
lieutenant
cary
since
then
has
anything
else
occurred
to
justify
such
suspicions
asked
carter
viewing
his
daughter
s
confession
more
seriously
now
oh
lots
of
is
with
people
also
closely
associated
with
then
she
told
about
punaro
and
her
belief
that
he
was
connected
with
the
cannery
fire
and
later
their
coming
unexpectedly
upon
him
at
the
dock
it
looked
to
both
brad
and
me
that
he
was
hiding
a
tightly
nailed
box
with
the
rubbish
on
the
grunted
her
father
significantly
dad
that
s
why
i
wanted
to
go
out
to
the
dump
pile
and
see
what
the
situation
was
for
her
father
had
risen
and
was
now
pacing
the
floor
he
turned
toward
her
sharply
and
said
surely
you
didn
t
go
ashore
there
oh
no
we
only
rode
by
then
billy
didn
t
get
the
germ
from
that
there
was
no
greater
chance
of
his
getting
it
there
than
anywhere
else
but
the
foolish
thing
kitty
was
you
two
going
alone
you
might
have
taken
brad
with
you
as
long
as
you
had
discussed
these
things
with
he
was
down
at
the
beach
for
the
afternoon
i
picked
up
more
clues
down
there
too
which
made
it
seem
certain
supplies
are
going
out
from
our
hospital
to
the
german
subs
one
of
the
coast
guard
men
told
about
them
finding
bayshore
bakery
bread
on
one
of
those
captured
if
that
was
all
they
re
getting
i
might
not
have
so
much
to
worry
about
said
her
father
kitty
glanced
at
him
sharply
what
do
you
mean
dad
you
think
they
re
getting
more
than
that
no
doubt
they
kitty
knew
he
was
keeping
something
from
her
however
she
was
determined
now
to
tell
him
all
another
strange
thing
happened
yesterday
that
may
or
may
not
be
yes
what
was
that
it
was
odd
after
seeing
old
uncle
mose
on
terrapin
island
sunday
someone
on
the
troop
train
yesterday
asked
me
about
kitty
gave
a
sprightly
account
of
the
veteran
returned
from
the
pacific
and
by
the
way
i
have
that
dollar
and
must
take
some
tobacco
to
the
old
and
what
connection
does
all
this
have
with
the
clues
you
re
running
down
vera
parsons
told
me
that
the
owner
of
terrapin
island
was
near
when
i
was
talking
to
that
fellow
she
said
he
actually
glared
at
me
when
he
heard
i
d
been
on
the
island
of
course
it
was
all
posted
over
with
no
trespassing
signs
and
maybe
we
shouldn
t
have
eaten
our
supper
we
did
no
harm
those
signs
generally
apply
to
hunting
fishing
and
but
dad
brad
and
i
are
wondering
if
this
beeson
isn
t
in
on
the
dirty
he
paused
in
front
of
her
his
face
showing
alert
interest
how
do
you
figure
that
out
uncle
mose
told
us
beeson
comes
here
to
the
hospital
for
food
scraps
for
his
hogs
brad
and
i
figure
there
s
obliged
to
be
a
middleman
to
make
the
contact
between
the
hospital
and
the
spies
from
the
chief
carter
s
face
was
eager
as
he
said
kitty
you
may
have
picked
up
a
missing
link
she
jumped
to
her
feet
now
and
stood
facing
her
father
dad
you
ve
been
keeping
something
from
me
too
illustration
you
may
have
picked
up
a
missing
link
i
ll
have
to
admit
i
have
kitten
you
had
enough
on
your
young
shoulders
without
being
burdened
with
my
suddenly
apprehension
pierced
her
heart
it
was
one
thing
to
work
for
the
sheer
thrill
of
trapping
spies
but
quite
another
to
find
her
father
was
really
involved
dad
what
is
it
she
asked
does
all
this
in
any
way
affect
you
a
while
back
i
thought
it
might
and
i
m
afraid
it
does
kitty
but
go
on
i
want
to
hear
your
reasons
for
believing
beeson
is
for
one
thing
he
leased
that
island
after
we
went
into
the
war
that
certainly
could
have
been
done
with
an
ulterior
motive
second
he
moved
uncle
mose
out
of
his
cabin
up
to
the
other
end
of
the
island
uncle
mose
used
to
live
in
sight
of
the
hospital
dump
pile
also
he
has
a
in
the
pine
a
brad
climbed
the
pine
after
we
got
billy
down
sunday
it
s
wired
to
make
climbing
easy
there
s
a
seat
at
the
top
with
a
marvelous
view
of
the
entire
marshes
and
out
to
but
you
didn
t
mention
all
this
we
thought
right
away
it
was
connected
with
the
whole
dirty
business
hazel
was
along
so
we
decided
to
say
nothing
until
we
could
figure
things
out
is
that
all
we
figured
that
a
small
radio
could
be
carried
up
on
beeson
s
back
so
he
could
direct
action
from
his
he
could
watch
people
coming
from
any
direction
and
warn
small
boats
coming
in
from
the
subs
seemed
like
a
perfect
her
father
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
a
slow
smile
spread
over
his
face
in
spite
of
the
anxiety
still
in
his
eyes
kitten
you
show
remarkable
talent
for
becoming
a
she
pursed
her
lips
too
is
that
all
you
ve
picked
up
about
beeson
beth
gilcrist
a
canteen
worker
over
in
bayport
who
meets
all
the
troop
trains
told
me
beeson
meets
most
of
them
so
he
does
eh
he
seems
to
have
no
scarcity
of
gas
for
these
trips
back
and
carter
sat
down
on
the
couch
and
stared
into
space
as
he
thought
over
what
she
had
told
him
and
another
thing
brad
found
out
from
the
man
who
looks
after
the
incinerator
that
repair
parts
have
come
for
it
twice
and
were
not
what
he
looks
like
somebody
at
the
factory
may
be
cooperating
in
keeping
it
out
of
order
carter
surmised
that
s
exactly
what
brad
and
i
figured
out
that
s
why
we
feel
so
certain
the
barge
goes
into
the
marshes
for
more
reasons
than
to
haul
off
carter
made
no
reply
to
this
but
just
sat
staring
ahead
of
him
kitty
recalled
what
he
had
said
as
they
were
coming
home
that
evening
the
inspector
was
coming
down
and
there
was
a
shortage
in
his
department
she
had
thought
when
he
mentioned
it
that
he
meant
a
financial
shortage
now
an
appalling
possibility
entered
her
mind
dad
could
your
shortage
have
anything
to
do
with
all
this
definitely
it
could
kitty
the
amazing
things
you
have
just
told
me
may
help
me
clear
up
a
very
embarrassing
kitty
recalled
that
he
had
said
once
that
there
were
some
things
he
couldn
t
talk
about
even
to
his
own
daughter
but
she
now
ventured
to
ask
can
t
you
tell
me
about
it
now
dad
i
m
going
to
he
retorted
in
a
tone
that
implied
his
desperation
but
this
is
for
you
alone
kitty
not
even
brad
is
to
her
eyes
widened
but
you
think
he
is
trustworthy
don
t
you
of
nevertheless
this
is
to
go
no
certainly
if
that
s
the
way
you
want
as
you
have
probably
guessed
willard
dawson
lost
out
here
for
the
very
shortage
i
am
now
but
i
m
sure
he
was
not
to
blame
either
who
could
look
at
his
fine
face
and
believe
him
capable
anything
dishonest
he
simply
couldn
t
be
a
traitor
any
more
than
you
dad
of
course
we
feel
certain
of
that
that
s
why
i
asked
to
be
sent
here
i
ve
been
in
hopes
of
clearing
up
the
hazel
came
here
for
the
same
reason
didn
t
she
yes
she
did
but
so
is
until
you
told
me
all
this
tonight
i
ve
run
into
nothing
but
just
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
there
was
a
shortage
all
medical
supplies
must
pass
through
my
hands
i
have
to
all
orders
i
have
been
most
careful
in
making
those
at
the
end
of
each
month
the
sum
total
of
materials
used
far
exceeds
the
normal
use
of
a
hospital
our
you
mean
medicines
bandages
and
things
like
that
dad
all
expendable
supplies
used
in
the
supplies
of
those
are
the
kind
of
things
they
d
be
badly
in
need
of
on
a
german
sub
yes
of
do
you
suppose
those
sneaks
are
getting
some
of
the
stuff
out
of
the
hospital
along
with
the
food
in
fact
kitty
the
whole
may
be
for
the
purpose
of
getting
our
medical
supplies
instead
of
food
almost
anyone
can
get
hold
of
food
to
let
the
enemy
have
but
the
drug
business
is
quite
a
different
kitty
felt
the
gooseflesh
prickle
along
her
spine
oh
dad
suppose
i
hadn
t
paid
any
attention
to
all
those
queer
things
don
t
be
too
complacent
about
it
all
kitty
we
haven
t
caught
the
saboteurs
yet
nor
pinned
anything
on
chapter
sixteen
further
revelations
they
brought
billy
home
from
the
hospital
the
next
day
like
most
husky
youngsters
he
was
soon
playing
around
the
house
and
by
the
end
of
the
week
seemed
none
the
worse
for
his
experience
i
m
afraid
you
have
a
somber
rival
in
your
son
kitty
said
one
evening
to
her
father
how
s
that
asked
carter
forcing
himself
out
of
his
preoccupation
he
has
quite
a
crush
on
of
her
her
father
laughed
in
a
manner
oh
he
has
eh
he
wants
me
to
invite
her
to
supper
again
and
let
him
sit
up
carter
laughed
you
must
do
that
kitten
but
for
hazel
s
watchful
care
billy
might
not
have
recovered
so
i
m
sure
of
and
by
the
way
my
dear
i
ve
talked
with
hazel
about
what
you
told
me
the
other
oh
did
you
she
told
me
about
the
chess
cary
hobnobbing
with
krome
punaro
and
men
from
the
when
i
saw
him
playing
with
punaro
i
thought
they
must
be
two
of
a
kind
i
was
already
suspicious
of
them
both
but
krome
seems
a
sort
somehow
i
hate
to
think
he
may
be
in
on
the
dirty
hazel
doesn
t
think
he
the
contrary
and
it
wouldn
t
be
very
likely
a
man
who
s
been
in
the
service
ten
or
twelve
did
hazel
tell
you
why
she
s
been
learning
to
play
chess
i
was
very
curious
but
didn
t
dare
to
kitty
s
surprise
her
father
laughed
heartily
hazel
s
keen
and
certainly
has
done
a
grand
job
as
detective
since
she
s
been
here
but
i
doubt
if
she
ll
make
a
go
of
the
chess
what
do
you
mean
she
has
a
theory
that
lieutenant
cary
engages
krome
in
a
chess
game
every
time
punaro
wants
to
get
away
with
something
in
the
something
clicked
in
kitty
s
mind
and
there
s
every
reason
to
believe
she
s
right
huh
so
you
re
backing
her
up
in
the
idea
not
at
all
and
i
ll
tell
you
why
the
other
night
when
brad
and
i
ran
into
punaro
down
at
the
dock
we
told
him
we
were
looking
for
chief
krome
right
away
he
said
he
s
upstairs
in
the
recreation
room
playing
chess
with
note
he
said
cary
not
there
was
a
slightly
quizzical
expression
on
chief
carter
s
face
as
he
asked
well
is
that
significant
very
a
man
who
had
known
cary
before
he
went
into
the
service
would
call
him
doctor
under
excitement
and
punaro
was
not
only
excited
but
furious
at
kitten
i
become
more
certain
every
day
that
you
should
give
up
your
canteen
work
and
join
the
no
indeed
i
have
more
pleasant
ambitions
for
service
to
my
country
she
retorted
so
punaro
knew
just
where
his
chief
was
the
other
night
just
like
that
said
kitty
snapping
her
fingers
it
certainly
looks
as
though
hazel
s
got
the
right
lieutenant
cary
keeps
krome
occupied
while
punaro
has
a
free
hand
does
sound
plausible
her
father
conceded
but
you
haven
t
told
me
hazel
s
idea
in
learning
to
play
chess
oh
i
think
she
hopes
to
engage
cary
sometimes
in
a
chess
game
when
he
would
prefer
to
have
krome
as
a
kitty
laughed
she
thinks
then
that
krome
may
go
below
and
find
punaro
at
his
dirty
she
said
if
that
could
happen
it
would
be
worth
the
discomfort
of
sitting
opposite
cary
for
a
game
of
on
friday
evening
over
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
doughnut
at
the
snack
bar
kitty
and
brad
made
plans
to
go
to
terrapin
island
the
following
afternoon
as
brad
would
have
the
afternoon
off
when
kitty
went
to
town
saturday
morning
she
spent
the
dollar
the
veteran
had
given
her
for
smoking
tobacco
and
bought
a
new
pipe
as
her
own
gift
to
uncle
mose
this
time
she
left
billy
in
good
hands
for
her
father
was
taking
hazel
into
bayport
to
a
picture
and
billy
was
to
go
with
them
so
kitty
started
off
with
brad
in
their
launch
early
in
the
afternoon
with
a
free
mind
with
patriotic
zeal
they
put
their
hands
to
the
oars
instead
of
using
the
gasoline
in
the
tank
kit
i
ve
been
doing
a
little
spying
since
we
last
had
a
chance
to
talk
brad
told
her
hope
you
picked
up
something
i
ve
been
watching
the
barge
oh
yes
i
ve
wondered
if
that
could
be
punaro
takes
the
stuff
off
to
the
dump
every
second
morning
he
uses
a
fast
little
motor
boat
for
towing
which
ought
to
make
the
haul
in
about
an
hour
over
to
the
dump
and
another
hour
is
that
his
schedule
oh
no
he
leaves
at
dawn
and
barely
gets
back
to
the
hospital
in
time
for
chow
at
noon
last
time
i
had
a
day
off
i
made
it
my
business
to
watch
his
does
anybody
go
with
him
no
it
s
really
a
job
which
suits
his
purpose
very
well
i
figure
punaro
has
at
least
two
hours
leeway
to
contact
his
they
rowed
past
the
hospital
and
soon
turned
south
through
the
inlet
the
water
was
rather
choppy
and
there
were
ragged
clouds
overhead
but
neither
of
them
were
afraid
of
a
little
rain
they
were
almost
in
sight
of
the
pines
on
terrapin
island
when
kitty
said
there
s
probably
someone
else
upstairs
in
the
hospital
who
s
involved
in
all
besides
cary
and
what
makes
you
think
that
she
had
to
be
careful
not
to
reveal
anything
her
father
had
told
her
but
she
thought
brad
might
be
in
a
position
to
pick
up
information
her
father
couldn
t
get
if
punaro
is
actually
supplying
the
subs
with
fresh
food
doesn
t
it
seem
possible
they
might
take
other
things
supplies
for
instance
you
re
right
i
hadn
t
thought
of
brad
s
pull
on
the
oars
quickened
as
his
thoughts
raced
ahead
with
this
new
idea
slow
up
exclaimed
kitty
when
she
was
out
of
breath
trying
to
keep
in
rhythm
this
is
no
marathon
you
brad
suddenly
drew
in
his
oar
and
turned
to
face
her
she
was
glad
enough
to
drift
for
a
few
minutes
and
rest
kitty
now
that
you
mention
that
fact
i
recall
seeing
punaro
talking
several
times
with
petty
officer
brinson
one
of
the
ward
attendants
i
thought
it
was
only
about
clearing
the
trash
from
the
wards
but
i
bet
brinson
could
get
away
with
plenty
if
he
had
a
mind
i
m
glad
you
told
me
about
him
brad
i
haven
t
had
a
chance
to
tell
you
i
talked
to
dad
about
all
you
did
kitty
nodded
i
was
so
unhappy
about
it
all
when
billy
got
sick
i
felt
that
somehow
i
was
to
blame
so
i
just
told
dad
what
did
he
think
plenty
i
mean
what
does
he
think
we
ought
to
do
with
all
this
information
we
ve
been
picking
up
he
didn
t
say
you
know
a
man
in
his
position
can
t
say
much
even
to
his
that
s
true
of
the
inspector
s
coming
down
soon
he
said
i
have
a
feeling
he
plans
to
take
it
up
with
kitty
decided
she
had
better
change
the
subject
for
fear
it
might
slip
out
that
her
father
was
dangerously
involved
illustration
suddenly
turned
to
the
tide
had
carried
them
in
closer
to
terrapin
island
while
they
talked
as
kitty
saw
the
beautiful
bluff
rising
out
of
the
surrounding
green
marshes
she
said
wouldn
t
that
make
a
grand
place
for
a
summer
home
i
ll
say
and
if
the
old
hindu
your
father
told
us
about
was
right
those
pines
ought
to
have
enough
vitality
to
make
us
kitty
laughed
and
picked
up
her
oar
we
d
better
go
on
and
see
uncle
mose
or
this
storm
s
going
to
catch
us
before
we
get
they
didn
t
stop
at
their
former
landing
place
but
rowed
on
along
the
inlet
flowing
east
of
the
island
it
was
indeed
a
lonely
spot
they
now
had
a
good
view
of
mangrove
island
beyond
a
mile
strip
of
marshy
flats
which
were
interlaced
with
tidewater
creeks
a
couple
of
cranes
stood
in
water
but
took
flight
at
the
sound
of
approaching
oars
their
long
legs
trailing
behind
them
like
streamers
a
line
of
pelicans
moved
out
toward
sea
their
wings
alternately
flapping
and
poised
as
they
followed
the
impulses
of
their
leader
don
t
you
love
it
here
exclaimed
kitty
i
ll
say
it
s
really
god
s
they
passed
the
spot
where
they
had
found
uncle
mose
fishing
and
saw
his
log
cabin
far
back
among
the
trees
what
ll
we
do
if
beeson
won
t
let
us
see
uncle
mose
asked
kitty
a
little
nervously
the
old
negro
told
us
his
new
house
is
right
back
of
beeson
s
surely
he
wouldn
t
be
so
rude
as
to
prevent
us
seeing
the
old
you
never
can
tell
those
no
trespassing
signs
may
apply
to
callers
a
half
mile
farther
on
they
came
in
sight
of
the
tradds
old
summer
home
no
doubt
it
had
once
been
a
fine
residence
but
even
from
the
water
they
could
see
that
its
tabby
walls
were
crumbling
and
the
paint
had
long
since
worn
off
the
columned
porch
though
the
grounds
were
neglected
and
old
azaleas
in
full
bloom
made
gorgeous
splashes
of
color
wisteria
vines
had
been
left
to
run
riotously
over
several
pines
and
the
lavender
blossoms
were
now
hanging
far
up
the
brown
trunks
seems
a
shame
for
a
man
like
beeson
to
have
such
a
heavenly
spot
said
kitty
when
they
shipped
their
oars
and
brad
made
the
boat
fast
to
a
rickety
dock
in
front
of
the
house
the
tide
had
just
begun
to
rise
so
that
their
boat
was
eight
or
ten
feet
below
the
level
of
the
dock
there
was
a
ladder
however
by
which
they
could
go
up
brad
had
just
given
kitty
a
hand
to
help
her
up
when
there
came
a
furious
baying
of
hounds
from
the
direction
of
the
house
a
moment
later
they
saw
three
dogs
making
for
the
dock
we
can
t
take
a
chance
on
them
exclaimed
brad
realizing
at
once
that
this
was
how
beeson
kept
intruders
away
from
his
house
kitty
tumbled
back
into
the
boat
while
brad
released
their
line
so
they
could
push
off
he
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
the
dogs
dashed
along
the
dock
and
hung
over
the
edge
their
fierce
jaws
dripping
as
they
barked
furiously
what
a
reception
exclaimed
kitty
it
really
looks
as
though
uncle
mose
won
t
get
his
smoking
tobacco
no
launch
tied
up
here
i
suppose
beeson
is
away
and
this
is
the
guard
he
has
would
an
honest
man
be
so
careful
that
nobody
comes
prowling
around
i
doubt
sally
and
lana
bright
have
lived
in
this
low
country
all
their
lives
they
say
the
doors
of
their
country
house
are
never
those
who
do
the
most
skulduggery
are
likely
to
be
very
suspicious
of
other
their
boat
was
carried
off
toward
a
shelving
beach
by
the
current
noting
this
the
dogs
left
their
high
perch
on
the
dock
and
ran
around
to
head
them
off
from
landing
anywhere
else
well
trained
aren
t
they
brad
commented
sure
looks
like
i
suppose
we
can
turn
around
and
go
home
the
way
we
came
brad
said
ruefully
i
hate
to
be
checkmated
like
this
kitty
said
in
disgust
she
reached
for
her
oar
when
suddenly
brad
exclaimed
wait
there
comes
kitty
glanced
in
the
direction
he
pointed
why
it
s
uncle
mose
himself
the
old
man
came
hobbling
down
the
path
when
he
was
in
hearing
distance
kitty
called
out
hi
uncle
mose
it
s
your
friends
call
off
the
uncle
mose
came
to
the
water
s
edge
and
peered
at
them
with
dimming
eyes
before
he
said
turning
to
the
dogs
shut
up
you
hounds
quit
dat
racket
don
you
know
quality
folks
when
you
sees
em
he
finally
had
to
get
a
stick
to
send
the
hounds
slinking
back
toward
the
house
brad
pushed
their
boat
closer
to
the
shelving
shore
where
the
old
man
stood
after
that
reception
i
guess
we
d
better
stay
in

kitty
glanced
uneasily
north
along
the
inlet
but
it
was
empty
in
the
slanting
sunlight
that
had
broken
through
ragged
clouds
so
he
warned

uncle

deep
in

his
gnarled
brown
hands

the

of

terrified
for

kitty
didn
t
take
time
to
tell
him
that
the
bootlegging
of
other
days
was
mild
to
what
she
now
knew
beeson
was
doing
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
in
alarm
she
had
caught
the
sound
of
a
distant
motorboat
reckon
dat
him
now
y
all
bettah
lef
out
o
here
right
now
warned
uncle
mose
chapter
seventeen
a
narrow
escape
you
got
time
to
cross
yonder
an
hide
in
de
marsh
uncle
mose
told
kitty
and
brad
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
approaching
motorboat
let
s
get
going
said
kitty
picking
up
her
oar
you
d
better
hide
your
tobacco
and
new
pipe
uncle
yas
m
sho
the
old
man
s
sunken
eyes
turned
toward
the
inlet
you
kin
hear
de
motorboat
a
long
time
fore
she
come
in
i
m
glad
you
told
us
what
you
did
uncle
mose
said
kitty
don
t
you
worry
beeson
will
never
buy
this
t
ank
de
lawd
you
tell
young
massa
i
keep
de
trus
an
look
atter
de
place
like
he
ask
me
brad
was
impatient
to
be
off
and
kitty
bent
her
back
to
the
oar
as
he
pulled
away
from
the
little
harbor
glancing
at
uncle
mose
before
they
turned
a
point
in
the
shore
she
saw
him
waving
his
battered
felt
hat
at
them
and
pointing
straight
across
the
marsh
instead
of
turning
north
by
the
way
they
had
come
they
headed
for
the
creeks
that
cut
the
marshy
wastelands
into
patterns
they
could
have
used
the
motor
for
greater
speed
but
kitty
knew
the
noise
would
carry
for
quite
a
distance
across
the
empty
wastes
not
until
they
had
gone
almost
a
mile
up
one
of
the
winding
creeks
did
they
pause
behind
the
shelter
of
some
tall
marsh
grass
hope
we
don
t
get
stuck
in
here
said
brad
tide
s
so
but
it
s
already
turned
that
s
a
she
rubbed
her
tired
hands
together
a
moment
and
said
uncle
mose
gave
us
an
earful
didn
t
he
i
ll
say
looks
as
though
that
s
the
final
piece
to
complete
the
maybe
and
maybe
not
kit
we
ve
got
to
catch
em
with
the
goods
before
we
can
really
bring
sure
is
risky
for
that
poor
old
negro
beeson
doesn
t
look
like
the
kind
of
man
who
would
hesitate
to
put
the
old
man
out
of
the
way
if
he
interferes
with
his
you
re
maybe
we
should
have
brought
him
away
with
us
just
oh
no
that
would
never
do
beeson
would
be
sure
you
were
what
happened
at
the
troop
train
the
other
i
guess
you
re
right
that
would
make
him
cut
off
his
traffic
with
the
germans
till
suspicion
dies
kit
it
s
come
to
the
point
where
we
no
longer
have
a
right
to
keep
all
this
to
you
mean
the
fbi
should
know
certainly
it
s
not
mere
surmise
now
what
uncle
mose
told
us
bears
out
accurately
the
theories
we
ve
been
you
re
right
even
though
they
had
prided
themselves
on
their
discoveries
so
far
kitty
had
to
admit
that
the
affair
was
now
too
dangerous
for
them
to
handle
she
could
never
forgive
herself
if
through
their
bungling
uncle
mose
lost
his
life
but
we
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
first
said
brad
it
s
beginning
to
look
as
though
we
re
in
for
a
real
blow
a
real
sou
suddenly
brad
half
rose
and
peered
above
the
strip
of
marsh
grass
behind
which
they
were
hiding
listen
kit
sounds
like
beeson
s
boat
is
coming
right
in
good
heavens
what
ll
we
do
she
crawled
over
to
the
stern
locker
and
hunted
for
the
field
glasses
as
she
adjusted
them
she
stood
in
the
boat
and
scanned
the
western
horizon
finally
she
concentrated
her
gaze
on
a
section
of
the
inlet
near
the
pine
bluff
no
he
isn
t
in
the
marshes
even
with
the
wind
taking
the
sound
from
us
the
bluff
must
be
a
sort
of
sounding
board
to
throw
it
we
ll
have
to
be
s
blowing
from
us
to
him
cautioned
brad
she
let
brad
have
the
glasses
and
he
watched
while
beeson
towed
the
barge
to
the
dock
uncle
mose
is
already
there
to
carry
the
food
scraps
up
to
the
hogs
he
explained
as
he
watched
can
you
see
anything
that
looks
like
supplies
for
the
germans
she
asked
not
at
this
he
handed
her
the
glasses
and
she
watched
until
beeson
went
stomping
up
to
the
house
in
his
knee
boots
great
masses
of
purple
clouds
boiled
in
the
western
sky
while
the
tall
marsh
grass
lay
almost
level
under
the
rushing
wind
we
d
better
beat
it
for
home
exclaimed
kitty
looks
to
me
as
if
this
is
turning
to
a
on
the
gulf
coast
she
had
often
seen
storms
come
up
like
this
in
a
very
short
time
there
was
a
hurricane
reported
south
of
we
re
getting
an
edge
of
the
gale
said
brad
they
debated
whether
to
return
to
the
inlet
with
which
they
were
familiar
but
decided
the
safest
course
would
be
to
follow
the
marshy
creek
even
thought
it
might
take
them
longer
to
get
home
brad
still
had
the
little
map
which
he
had
sketched
in
his
billfold
they
studied
that
trying
to
figure
out
the
most
direct
route
back
to
palmetto
island
this
creek
swings
round
mighty
close
to
mangrove
island
kitty
said
dubiously
that
s
better
than
going
too
close
to
terrapin
acting
upon
their
decision
they
picked
up
their
oars
again
they
were
now
moving
against
the
force
of
the
rising
tide
and
found
progress
slow
they
made
several
elbow
turns
and
eventually
found
themselves
close
enough
to
mangrove
island
to
make
a
landing
if
they
had
so
desired
i
ve
wanted
to
explore
it
ever
since
you
boys
told
me
about
seeing
the
boat
in
the
mangroves
on
the
other
side
kitty
said
no
time
to
explore
now
brad
stated
rather
shortly
if
i
ever
get
you
out
of
this
saboteurs
nest
i
ll
never
bring
you
into
the
marshes
the
war
s
kitty
laughed
i
m
not
afraid
brad
what
s
there
to
be
afraid
of
now
even
as
she
spoke
there
came
a
pinging
sound
piercing
and
sharp
above
the
howl
of
the
wind
almost
simultaneously
brad
groaned
and
slapped
his
hand
to
his
shoulder
as
he
toppled
backward
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
oar
slipped
from
his
limp
fingers
and
bobbed
off
on
the
tide
lie
down
kit
lie
down
he
ordered
even
as
he
fell
brad
are
you
hurt
she
wailed
with
his
right
hand
he
seized
her
arm
and
pulled
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
beside
him
the
hand
was
wet
with
blood
from
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
he
got
me
all
right
but
keep
low
don
t
lift
your
head
above
the
two
more
shots
came
whistling
across
the
boat
we
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
stated
brad
desperately
even
if
they
had
two
oars
to
use
kitty
knew
it
would
be
suicide
to
sit
up
to
row
i
ll
start
the
motor
she
said
on
her
stomach
she
wiggled
toward
the
motor
at
such
a
disadvantage
she
wondered
if
she
could
get
the
engine
going
but
she
must
there
was
no
other
way
for
them
to
get
away
from
that
shower
of
lead
but
you
can
t
see
to
steer
said
brad
we
ll
go
headlong
into
the
we
ve
got
to
take
a
chance
i
have
a
general
idea
of
the
channel
beyond
this
way
the
other
day
when
billy
and
i
came
to
kitty
s
infinite
relief
the
starter
responded
to
her
touch
the
sound
of
that
motor
was
only
an
invitation
to
more
shots
this
time
they
were
aimed
low
evidently
with
the
hope
of
puncturing
the
boat
s
side
and
hitting
them
as
they
crouched
below
the
gunwale
but
the
lead
spattered
harmlessly
into
the
water
illustration
brad
are
you
hurt
kitty
by
holding
the
lower
curve
of
the
wheel
and
watching
the
shore
kitty
could
steer
and
give
the
motor
as
much
speed
as
she
dared
when
they
had
gone
several
yards
and
just
after
a
fresh
spatter
of
lead
struck
their
stern
she
took
a
chance
on
lifting
her
eyes
high
enough
for
a
look
ahead
three
more
shots
trailed
them
but
fell
short
of
the
mark
and
a
few
minutes
later
they
felt
that
they
must
be
out
of
range
by
the
smudge
of
smoke
at
their
right
kitty
knew
they
were
now
passing
the
dump
pile
with
open
safer
water
ahead
not
until
then
did
she
dare
give
the
boat
any
real
speed
she
glanced
down
and
saw
brad
s
face
drawn
and
white
at
her
feet
blood
had
run
from
his
coat
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
kitty
rose
from
her
crouching
position
and
saw
a
sheltering
arm
of
marshland
ahead
when
she
rounded
this
so
the
boat
was
hidden
from
mangrove
island
she
cut
off
her
motor
and
bent
over
brad
when
she
unbuttoned
his
coat
she
found
his
shirt
saturated
with
blood
a
little
lower
and
it
would
have
gone
through
your
heart
she
said
anxiously
wait
i
ll
try
to
stop
that
she
was
thankful
her
father
always
kept
the
launch
prepared
for
emergencies
they
never
went
out
without
field
glasses
flashlights
a
lantern
a
jug
of
water
tins
of
food
and
a
kit
her
deft
fingers
cut
away
the
bloody
clothes
she
cleaned
the
wound
as
best
she
could
then
bound
it
tightly
to
check
the
blood
you
seem
to
know
how
to
do
it
he
said
gratefully
i
took
two
courses
at
school
but
haven
t
had
much
chance
to
hope
you
don
t
have
another
chance
like
this
any
time
soon
he
said
ruefully
with
the
blood
checked
brad
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
his
left
arm
lying
limp
in
his
lap
you
knew
somebody
was
watching
us
before
the
shot
came
said
kitty
with
conviction
recalling
his
sudden
anxiety
to
have
her
safely
home
he
nodded
i
didn
t
say
anything
i
didn
t
want
to
frighten
you
i
thought
it
might
be
somebody
quite
far
from
it
kit
i
thought
i
saw
the
blue
of
a
sailor
s
oh
then
it
wasn
t
germans
hiding
there
till
beeson
came
back
i
may
have
been
mistaken
about
the
clothes
but
anybody
from
the
island
could
have
seen
us
watching
beeson
go
ashore
at
his
that
s
so
kitty
admitted
no
doubt
they
have
field
glasses
it
wasn
t
likely
to
be
anybody
from
the
they
d
take
too
much
risk
coming
ashore
any
time
but
at
a
sailor
s
uniform
she
repeated
could
it
have
been
punaro
it
s
possible
of
course
cary
wears
blue
but
i
thought
you
said
punaro
always
brought
the
stuff
out
here
in
the
early
morning
you
forget
this
is
saturday
afternoon
he
s
off
too
brad
reminded
her
she
realized
then
how
ghastly
white
he
had
grown
his
lips
had
a
bluish
look
and
he
was
trembling
slightly
in
the
chill
wind
she
was
afraid
of
shock
from
the
loss
of
blood
and
hurried
back
to
her
motor
she
must
take
him
to
the
hospital
as
speedily
as
possible
chapter
eighteen
a
caller
in
the
dark
by
the
time
kitty
was
in
sight
of
the
hospital
the
storm
had
reached
gale
proportions
and
even
the
inland
sheltered
waterways
were
whipped
into
tumbling
whitecaps
shall
i
go
straight
to
the
unloading
dock
behind
the
hospital
she
asked
against
regulations
nothing
s
supposed
to
come
ashore
there
but
she
was
afraid
brad
couldn
t
walk
to
the
hospital
from
any
of
the
small
landing
docks
farther
east
but
she
decided
he
could
wait
in
the
boat
while
she
went
to
their
house
for
the
car
it
ll
probably
be
better
to
go
ashore
somewhere
else
anyhow
she
told
him
wish
i
didn
t
have
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
just
now
he
said
if
it
gets
around
that
i
was
shot
in
the
marshes
lieutenant
cary
will
be
sure
to
hear
about
put
a
crimp
in
drawing
a
noose
around
the
criminals
why
didn
t
i
think
of
that
before
said
kitty
i
ll
take
you
to
our
house
surely
dad
will
be
back
from
town
by
the
time
we
get
there
he
ll
know
what
s
best
to
i
hate
to
be
so
much
bother
but
that
does
seem
the
most
sensible
thing
you
can
phone
williams
he
s
the
closest
friend
i
have
among
the
doctors
he
ll
take
care
of
the
wound
and
keep
his
mouth
shut
sure
that
s
just
what
we
ll
i
don
t
have
to
report
for
duty
till
monday
nobody
will
get
curious
about
me
till
when
kitty
turned
the
bend
in
the
channel
and
rounded
the
point
on
which
the
hospital
stood
she
thought
she
had
never
faced
such
a
howling
gale
she
glanced
toward
the
island
and
saw
that
the
hurricane
flag
was
flying
brad
ducked
his
head
and
clung
to
the
seat
kitty
anchored
herself
to
the
wheel
and
steered
for
the
landing
behind
their
cottage
already
lights
were
twinkling
along
shore
though
enough
twilight
lingered
for
her
to
come
in
to
the
dock
without
too
much
uncertainty
never
before
had
she
attempted
to
make
her
moorings
in
such
a
choppy
sea
the
stormy
wind
had
forced
the
rising
tide
up
rapidly
she
was
glad
of
this
for
it
would
spare
brad
a
climb
to
the
dock
she
was
afraid
the
force
of
the
storm
would
pound
the
launch
against
the
pilings
so
she
cut
off
their
motor
and
with
the
remaining
oar
worked
toward
the
lee
side
of
the
dock
it
took
all
her
skill
to
make
any
progress
as
she
had
to
move
straight
into
the
teeth
of
the
rushing
wind
that
swept
diagonally
across
the
island
brad
was
powerless
to
help
her
for
his
one
hand
was
needed
to
hold
himself
to
the
seat
don
t
try
to
help
kitty
called
to
him
as
he
started
to
crawl
forward
i
ll
make
it
the
least
little
strain
will
start
that
place
bleeding
in
spite
of
her
warning
after
kitty
got
the
boat
close
enough
brad
seized
their
line
and
tossed
it
deftly
over
a
hook
on
the
dock
the
rope
creaked
and
the
boat
quivered
at
the
sudden
restriction
can
you
make
it
up
the
ladder
kitty
asked
anxiously
there
were
only
three
or
four
steps
to
climb
but
even
that
would
be
a
strain
on
brad
in
his
weakened
condition
maybe
you
d
better
go
ahead
and
give
me
a
hand
he
was
forced
to
admit
guess
i
m
no
she
hadn
t
realized
how
weak
he
was
until
she
tried
to
help
him
up
that
ladder
she
had
to
pull
him
by
his
good
arm
every
step
of
the
way
when
he
reached
the
dock
he
collapsed
at
her
feet
desperately
she
glanced
toward
the
village
hoping
for
help
but
the
storm
had
evidently
driven
everyone
to
shelter
a
small
boat
battled
the
gale
half
way
between
them
and
the
hospital
but
the
howling
wind
would
drown
her
call
for
help
she
was
afraid
to
leave
him
on
the
dock
while
she
went
for
help
the
gale
might
grow
strong
enough
any
minute
to
sweep
him
into
the
water
there
was
danger
of
opening
the
wound
again
if
she
tried
to
move
him
but
she
had
no
choice
carefully
she
lifted
his
head
against
her
knees
locked
her
hands
under
his
arms
and
dragged
him
down
the
dock
to
the
shelter
of
a
twisted
oak
that
grew
on
the
shell
bank
she
was
already
wet
from
the
mist
and
spray
and
now
rain
came
in
a
sudden
deluge
it
mingled
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
as
she
ran
the
block
and
a
half
to
her
home
with
a
thankful
prayer
she
saw
that
the
lights
were
on
jane
at
least
must
be
there
let
me
in
she
called
actually
pounding
the
door
with
her
fists
jane
swung
the
door
in
almost
at
once
why

kitty

like
a
scarecrow

jane
i
don
t
want
kitty
to
strain
herself
helping
me

billy

already
in
bed
so
carter
closed
the
door
softly
he

be
all
right
we
ll
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
i
ll
drop
you
two
off
here
before
i
take

on
to
the
he
hurried
out
to
get
the
car
and
kitty
followed
him
saying
but
we
don
t
want
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
he
doesn
t
want
them
to
what
are
you
talking
about
my
child
that
s
the
place
for
not
under
the
circumstances
kitty
tumbled
into
the
car
beside
him
and
jane
got
into
the
back
praying
aloud
excitedly
carter
started
the
motor
and
they
raced
out
the
drive
please
do
as
i
say
dad
persisted
kitty
just
this
once
dad
there
s
no
time
to
tell
you
everything
but
we
ve
learned
things
this
afternoon
that
may
put
a
stop
to
all
this
awful
carter
made
no
reply
for
a
moment
grimly
intent
upon
his
driving
in
the
rain
finally
he
said
i
ve
been
a
fool
kitty
to
let
you
go
ahead
and
get
into
something
like
kitty
was
too
miserable
over
brad
to
pay
much
attention
to
her
father
s
rebuke
there
he
s
under
the
oak
yonder
she
directed
when
they
turned
the
corner
and
raced
down
the
block
they
found
brad
had
recovered
consciousness
and
was
sitting
with
his
back
propped
against
the
tree
trunk
so
silly
of
me
to
check
out
he
apologized
when
they
approached
him
i
figured
you
d
gone
for
the
think
you
can
get
in
asked
carter
sure
brad
tried
to
make
light
of
his
weakness
but
he
was
a
dead
weight
on
carter
as
he
helped
him
to
his
feet
guess
you
ve
lost
a
lot
of
blood
old
boy
where
did
they
hit
you
just
under
my
shoulder
blade
kitty
bound
it
up
but
i
d
spilled
plenty
before
she
got
a
chance
to
do
kitty
breathed
easier
when
he
was
in
the
front
seat
beside
her
father
she
and
jane
sat
in
the
back
nothing
more
was
said
until
carter
stopped
the
car
in
front
of
their
house
instead
of
going
into
the
drive
jane
you
get
out
and
stay
with
billy
kitty
you
can
come
on
up
to
the
hospital
with
us
if
you
d
there
were
tears
in
kitty
s
voice
when
she
wailed
but
dad
we
don
t
want
them
to
know
about
this
at
the
hospital
this
is
no
time
to
think
of
such
things
kitty
it
s
quite
evident
brad
will
need
a
blood
transfusion
the
hospital
is
the
proper
place
for
when
jane
got
out
and
her
father
drove
on
toward
the
hospital
kitty
couldn
t
keep
the
tears
back
what
a
mess
she
had
made
of
the
whole
business
if
she
had
known
brad
must
go
to
the
hospital
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
stop
at
the
supply
dock
regulations
or
no
regulations
now
everybody
at
the
hospital
would
know
anyhow
that
he
had
been
shot
how
the
talk
would
fly
from
mouth
to
mouth
even
if
punaro
wasn
t
the
guilty
party
he
would
learn
about
it
if
he
was
really
in
league
with
beeson
he
in
turn
would
get
the
facts
and
surmise
that
they
had
visited
terrapin
island
again
in
that
event
she
feared
for
uncle
mose
s
safety
but
after
all
she
thought
finally
what
did
any
of
this
matter
compared
with
brad
s
welfare
her
father
had
a
stretcher
brought
down
to
take
brad
to
the
emergency
room
as
kitty
followed
into
the
hospital
she
said
dad
if
brad
s
blood
is
type
one
i
ll
be
glad
to
give
him
blood
for
a
her
father
turned
and
flashed
her
a
smile
thanks
kitten
but
i
think
we
have
a
generous
supply
of
all
types
here
i
ll
go
on
to
the
emergency
room
and
see
what
his
condition
oh
dad
i
don
t
think
i
can
stand
it
if
brad
dies
it
s
all
my
fault
i
was
the
one
who
suggested
going
out
there
stop
blaming
yourself
my
child
for
everything
that
goes
wrong
he
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
here
s
the
key
to
my
office
wait
up
there
where
it
s
quiet
i
ll
come
up
later
and
tell
you
how
brad
i
want
to
hear
all
about
what
kitty
was
glad
he
had
thought
of
this
for
her
wet
clothes
and
troubled
face
would
certainly
invite
questions
from
any
friends
who
might
see
her
she
hurried
out
to
the
wing
and
up
the
steps
to
the
second
floor
instead
of
taking
the
elevator
she
had
never
been
in
the
administrative
wing
at
night
when
everyone
was
off
duty
there
was
light
in
only
one
office
as
she
went
down
the
short
hall
on
the
upper
floor
strangely
enough
she
felt
more
nervous
there
than
she
had
in
the
lonely
marshes
before
the
shooting
she
was
tempted
to
turn
back
and
go
to
hazel
s
room
but
she
knew
that
would
invite
questions
and
call
for
explanations
for
which
she
was
in
no
mood
at
the
moment
in
her
father
s
office
she
could
be
quiet
to
calm
herself
after
so
much
excitement
and
strain
she
unlocked
the
door
and
touched
the
light
button
she
crossed
to
her
father
s
desk
chair
and
sat
down
a
moment
she
felt
she
couldn
t
live
through
this
interval
while
waiting
to
hear
about
brad
to
divert
her
mind
she
reached
for
a
book
in
a
rack
at
the
back
of
the
desk
it
proved
to
be
a
medical
tome
whose
language
seemed
dry
as
dust
to
her
excited
mind
in
the
basket
at
the
right
of
the
desk
were
some
addressed
envelopes
and
a
stack
of
orders
that
had
been
made
up
and
signed
by
her
father
but
had
not
yet
been
mailed
her
eyes
ran
down
the
list
of
drugs
and
supplies
that
had
been
ordered
while
sitting
there
she
suddenly
shivered
and
realized
her
clothes
were
wet
through
noticing
one
of
her
father
s
coats
hanging
on
a
rack
in
the
corner
she
put
it
on
and
went
to
the
big
armchair
near
the
window
she
took
off
her
wet
shoes
and
socks
and
tucked
her
feet
under
her
woollen
skirt
until
they
were
warm
the
chair
faced
the
window
and
as
she
sat
there
she
recalled
that
her
father
had
pointed
out
the
location
of
mangrove
island
from
that
very
window
how
long
ago
it
seemed
she
wondered
if
punaro
or
whoever
had
shot
at
them
was
still
out
there
wind
shook
the
window
as
it
came
howling
in
from
the
sea
the
rain
had
stopped
however
and
kitty
wondered
if
she
could
see
anything
across
the
marshes
at
night
she
padded
across
the
office
on
bare
feet
and
switched
off
the
light
while
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
she
sat
on
the
window
ledge
peering
out
wondering
if
the
nazi
spies
would
dare
come
ashore
in
such
a
storm
to
pick
up
their
loot
would
anyone
be
so
foolhardy
the
night
was
impenetrably
black
under
lowering
clouds
she
could
see
nothing
except
the
glow
at
the
marine
base
to
the
east
and
a
few
house
lights
in
the
settlement
around
the
hospital
then
anxiety
for
brad
swept
over
her
again
there
was
no
use
trying
to
think
of
anything
else
unhappily
she
sank
back
into
the
leather
chair
she
pulled
her
father
s
coat
closer
about
her
sat
on
her
feet
again
and
was
soon
comfortably
warm
the
wind
came
in
from
the
sea
like
giant
breakers
rolling
up
a
beach
it
crashed
against
the
big
building
then
there
would
be
a
momentary
lull
before
the
next
gust
came
to
kitty
s
alarm
now
that
she
paused
to
listen
each
blast
seemed
worse
than
the
one
that
had
just
struck
as
soon
as
she
heard
from
brad
they
would
go
back
to
the
cottage
for
billy
and
jane
she
had
been
through
too
many
storms
on
the
gulf
coast
to
feel
safe
in
a
small
house
on
a
night
like
this
under
the
circumstances
it
didn
t
seem
possible
she
could
have
dozed
but
kitty
came
to
herself
with
a
start
at
the
sound
of
a
key
in
the
door
instantly
she
was
on
the
alert
her
father
had
given
her
his
key
if
it
were
he
she
thought
he
would
have
rapped
and
called
to
her
to
let
him
in
cautiously
she
crouched
deeper
in
the
leather
chair
as
the
door
swung
inward
noiselessly
she
saw
by
the
light
from
the
hall
a
tall
familiar
form
step
into
the
room
he
closed
the
door
softly
then
switching
on
a
flash
he
moved
quickly
toward
the
desk
as
the
flashlight
circled
about
the
desk
top
for
a
moment
it
tilted
so
that
reflected
illumination
struck
the
sneak
s
face
her
surmise
had
been
correct
it
was
lieutenant
cary
in
the
dark
corner
the
terrified
girl
watched
breathlessly
her
eyes
were
just
above
the
chair
back
as
cary
examined
the
order
blanks
in
the
large
basket
on
the
desk
apparently
finding
what
he
wanted
he
took
up
the
sheaf
of
papers
and
buttoned
them
under
his
coat
kitty
was
almost
beside
herself
with
terror
so
it
was
really
cary
who
did
the
underhand
business
that
got
both
the
chief
pharmacist
s
mates
into
trouble
she
couldn
t
let
him
get
away
with
it
but
what
in
the
world
could
she
do
in
her
defenseless
position
lieutenant
cary
was
almost
at
the
door
when
without
any
premeditation
kitty
found
herself
saying
in
the
fiercest
tone
she
could
command
don
t
move
another
step
lieutenant
cary
or
i
ll
shoot
illustration
don
t
move
or
i
ll
shoot
chapter
nineteen
trapped
the
instant
kitty
made
that
threat
she
was
appalled
at
her
daring
lieutenant
cary
might
have
a
pistol
and
fire
in
her
direction
in
the
darkness
terrified
she
crouched
in
the
chair
cary
didn
t
move
or
speak
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
then
she
heard
an
almost
imperceptible
rattle
of
paper
he
must
be
trying
to
slide
those
orders
from
under
his
coat
to
remove
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
leave
those
papers
under
your
coat
she
ordered
the
paper
rattling
ceased
then
suddenly
she
caught
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
hall
it
would
do
no
good
for
her
to
scream
and
call
for
help
anyone
passing
down
the
hall
was
not
likely
to
have
a
key
that
would
fit
this
door
she
couldn
t
forget
that
cary
might
have
a
gun
but
would
he
dare
use
it
with
someone
in
hearing
kitty
decided
this
was
the
best
moment
for
action
her
bare
feet
made
no
sound
as
she
glided
across
the
floor
if
she
could
only
reach
the
door
while
someone
else
was
near
she
might
have
a
chance
even
after
having
been
in
darkness
for
quite
a
while
her
dilated
eyes
could
distinguish
little
in
the
room
no
doubt
their
surroundings
were
still
more
veiled
to
cary
she
had
only
reached
the
back
of
the
desk
when
she
heard
a
key
slip
into
the
door
lock
relief
flooded
over
her
in
a
great
wave
only
to
be
followed
by
stark
terror
at
what
cary
might
do
if
her
father
came
in
and
found
him
here
the
door
swung
in
and
the
light
flashed
up
almost
at
the
same
moment
cary
hurled
himself
at
chief
carter
the
impact
was
so
completely
unexpected
that
carter
was
thrown
back
against
the
partly
open
door
and
it
closed
with
a
bang
so
it
s
you
cary
exclaimed
carter
even
as
he
went
down
kitty
seized
cary
s
coat
as
he
made
a
lunge
at
her
father
a
moment
later
she
realized
that
someone
who
had
been
coming
here
with
her
father
had
been
shut
out
by
the
banging
door
he
was
now
pounding
it
impatiently
kitty
sprang
to
open
it
and
a
officer
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
rushed
to
her
father
s
aid
fortunately
he
was
armed
and
a
minute
later
had
backed
cary
into
a
corner
the
order
sheets
from
chief
carter
s
desk
had
slipped
from
under
the
physician
s
coat
and
were
scattered
over
the
floor
her
father
got
to
his
feet
and
faced
the
officer
well
captain
rogers
this
is
a
bit
of
luck
the
captain
laughed
shortly
without
shifting
his
gaze
from
cary
we
scarcely
dared
hope
to
catch
him
in
the
i
expect
we
ll
have
to
give
credit
for
the
catching
to
my
daughter
replied
chief
carter
glancing
proudly
at
kitty
how
did
you
manage
it
young
lady
asked
the
captain
kitty
thought
how
terrified
she
would
be
to
face
him
at
a
trial
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
whose
dealings
with
had
soured
him
on
the
world
i
must
confess
i
didn
t
do
any
managing
kitty
admitted
ruefully
i
was
sitting
here
waiting
for
dad
when
in
came
lieutenant
waiting
in
the
dark
her
father
asked
i
turned
off
the
light
to
watch
the
what
i
could
see
outside
kitty
floundered
didn
t
realize
anyone
was
in
here
asked
the
officer
kitty
s
excited
breath
caught
in
her
throat
a
moment
before
she
could
explain
he
went
straight
to
dad
s
desk
with
a
flashlight
and
picked
up
those
order
she
pointed
to
the
papers
strewn
over
the
floor
he
stuffed
them
under
his
we
must
have
come
just
as
he
did
that
surmised
her
father
no
it
seemed
an
eternity
i
told
him
not
to
move
or
i
d
but
kitty
you
had
no
gun
exclaimed
her
father
why
do
you
take
such
foolhardy
chances
my
child
then
you
came
i
was
going
to
try
to
get
out
the
door
while
someone
was
passing
i
didn
t
dare
hope
it
was
though
captain
rogers
hadn
t
taken
his
eyes
off
cary
for
a
moment
kitty
saw
the
shadow
of
a
smile
twitch
around
the
straight
lines
of
his
mouth
then
he
spoke
suddenly
mr
carter
please
phone
minger
to
come
up
with
some
handcuffs
our
lieutenant
here
looks
like
a
volcano
that
may
erupt
at
any
moment
no
doubt
it
s
bitter
for
him
to
know
he
has
been
caught
by
this
alert
young
cary
at
bay
in
the
corner
seemed
turned
to
stone
his
baleful
glances
had
swept
from
one
to
the
other
as
they
spoke
but
otherwise
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
changed
to
betray
his
real
feelings
no
doubt
the
nazis
had
trained
him
so
well
that
to
die
for
the
fuehrer
in
an
attempt
to
serve
him
was
a
coveted
sacrifice
the
petty
officer
with
the
handcuffs
came
up
in
an
amazingly
short
time
kitty
thought
he
too
was
a
stranger
to
her
when
the
irons
had
been
snapped
over
the
physician
s
wrists
captain
rogers
said
take
him
away
minger
i
ll
join
you
lieutenant
cary
s
head
was
held
high
as
he
walked
out
his
only
act
of
defiance
was
to
step
deliberately
on
the
scattered
order
blanks
kitty
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
door
to
close
before
she
asked
oh
dad
tell
me
about
brad
is
he
going
to
be
all
right
we
hope
so
kitten
her
father
replied
gently
the
wound
isn
t
so
bad
the
bullet
was
extracted
without
too
much
trouble
and
no
bones
were
he
lost
so
much
blood
before
i
could
do
anything
for
him
she
said
with
regret
his
strength
will
come
back
as
soon
as
he
has
a
oh
dad
it
s
all
been
so
awful
wailed
kitty
suddenly
she
threw
her
arms
over
his
shoulders
and
burst
into
tears
her
father
held
her
to
him
a
moment
consolingly
this
last
experience
was
a
little
too
much
eh
kitten
i
just
knew
he
was
going
to
kill
you
the
minute
you
opened
that
door
well
he
didn
t
let
s
hope
the
worst
is
over
carter
went
toward
a
cabinet
in
the
corner
i
m
going
to
fix
you
a
small
dose
of
medicine
to
calm
your
oh
i
ll
be
all
right
in
a
no
you
d
better
take
this
her
father
insisted
you
ll
need
it
to
fortify
you
we
still
have
much
to
talk
about
captain
rogers
may
want
to
ask
you
some
why
is
yes
he
s
the
man
i
sent
for
when
you
told
me
all
you
had
uncovered
the
other
kitty
felt
rather
stunned
at
this
information
yet
relieved
too
she
would
be
glad
to
get
the
whole
business
off
her
mind
and
all
this
information
into
responsible
hands
captain
rogers
had
gathered
the
scattered
papers
and
was
examining
them
while
kitty
drank
the
medicine
and
let
her
father
lead
her
again
to
the
big
armchair
he
placed
two
other
chairs
close
then
found
an
old
sweater
and
wrapped
it
around
his
daughter
s
bare
feet
you
mustn
t
get
chilled
after
such
a
trying
day
he
said
then
he
joined
captain
rogers
at
his
desk
and
they
stood
conferring
in
low
tones
for
a
few
minutes
gradually
kitty
began
to
feel
relaxed
and
infinitely
relieved
that
the
suspense
of
these
last
weeks
had
at
last
reached
a
climax
she
was
now
impatient
to
talk
over
everything
with
her
father
and
his
superior
officer
there
was
much
she
wanted
to
know
too
feeling
better
asked
her
father
coming
back
and
standing
by
her
chair
he
took
the
damp
kerchief
from
her
head
and
ran
his
fingers
through
her
tumbled
curls
oh
much
well
suppose
you
tell
us
what
happened
this
afternoon
when
you
and
brad
went
out
to
terrapin
captain
rogers
came
over
and
sat
astride
a
straight
chair
his
arms
folded
over
the
back
as
he
faced
her
this
informality
instantly
put
kitty
at
her
ease
while
she
gave
a
detailed
account
of
her
afternoon
up
to
the
time
she
had
brought
brad
home
young
lady
you
have
shown
remarkable
keenness
in
handling
this
situation
said
the
captain
kitty
flushed
oh
no
i
ve
made
lots
of
mistakes
you
don
t
oh
yes
i
do
he
retorted
your
father
has
told
me
everything
up
to
date
however
i
must
admit
you
made
one
mistake
in
the
very
she
met
his
piercing
brown
eyes
squarely
i
know
she
nodded
i
should
have
reported
my
very
first
suspicions
to
the
exactly
no
sensitive
young
lady
should
attempt
to
deal
with
nazi
or
jap
but
i
was
afraid
to
tell
anyone
until
they
had
been
maneuvered
into
a
position
where
they
could
really
be
captain
rogers
laughed
unexpectedly
she
doesn
t
have
a
very
high
regard
for
the
secret
investigators
of
her
country
eh
carter
oh
i
don
t
mean
it
that
way
kitty
hastened
to
apologize
but
you
see
from
the
very
beginning
was
afraid
that
somehow
this
s
involved
one
doesn
t
run
to
the
fbi
about
things
where
one
s
father
may
be
captain
rogers
glanced
significantly
at
the
chief
pharmacist
s
mate
well
carter
i
suppose
that
puts
a
stop
to
my
he
suddenly
grew
serious
again
as
he
turned
to
kitty
to
say
young
lady
if
you
had
known
what
perfect
confidence
we
have
in
this
dad
of
yours
you
would
have
had
no
fears
when
we
sent
him
here
we
knew
he
was
the
one
man
who
could
stop
the
dirty
business
going
anyone
it
was
chief
carter
s
turn
to
look
surprised
but
i
asked
to
be
sent
here
he
exclaimed
captain
rogers
laughed
you
were
only
one
step
ahead
of
us
we
had
planned
to
ask
you
to
take
this
post
in
hopes
of
clearing
up
the
then
you
knew
the
fault
was
not
in
this
office
but
you
dumped
chief
dawson
down
in
that
was
only
a
blind
to
throw
the
guilty
parties
off
the
track
until
we
could
pin
the
goods
on
them
dawson
understands
all
that
but
is
pledged
to
well
for
goodness
sake
burst
forth
kitty
if
i
d
had
any
idea
of
all
that
i
would
have
told
everything
long
if
several
people
had
had
an
idea
of
all
this
we
might
never
have
sprung
this
trap
explained
captain
rogers
you
speak
as
if
it
were
really
sprung
said
kitty
eagerly
it
it
seems
rather
certain
that
punaro
is
responsible
for
young
brad
mason
s
wound
he
was
away
from
the
hospital
all
afternoon
i
ll
order
his
arrest
shortly
as
for
beeson
he
s
practically
a
prisoner
on
that
island
until
this
blow
is
over
we
ll
be
prepared
to
handle
him
as
soon
as
we
can
get
out
you
won
t
let
anything
happen
to
poor
uncle
mose
we
ll
do
our
best
the
old
darky
is
certainly
entitled
to
his
reward
too
in
opening
your
eyes
to
so
but
there
are
others
brad
thinks
one
of
the
ward
attendants
may
be
helping
oh
yes
they
figure
they
have
a
perfect
said
captain
rogers
first
they
put
the
incinerator
out
of
order
to
make
an
opening
for
traffic
into
the
marshes
lieutenant
cary
with
the
assistance
of
your
father
s
dad
s
stenographer
exclaimed
kitty
completely
shocked
i
was
just
as
surprised
as
you
kitten
when
that
amazing
fact
dawned
on
me
explained
carter
miss
dales
seemed
such
a
quiet
clinging
vine
sort
i
couldn
t
feature
her
daring
to
mix
in
anything
like
why
dad
i
can
t
believe
it
she
acted
as
though
she
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
she
had
been
dawson
s
secretary
so
i
thought
surely
she
was
all
we
were
rather
relieved
you
kept
her
on
put
in
rogers
we
had
our
suspicions
of
her
all
along
any
change
might
have
put
them
too
much
on
the
if
you
hadn
t
given
me
a
hint
about
her
captain
rogers
said
carter
i
might
not
have
thought
of
setting
this
trap
tonight
we
finished
up
these
order
sheets
just
before
i
left
the
office
and
i
told
her
to
mail
instead
she
left
them
where
cary
could
get
them
she
has
done
numberless
times
before
so
he
could
add
his
order
for
medicine
for
the
german
subs
above
your
exactly
said
carter
so
that
s
why
there
s
been
so
much
suspicion
about
the
orders
that
go
in
said
kitty
but
how
has
lieutenant
cary
been
getting
hold
of
the
extra
supplies
when
they
come
back
the
shipments
are
carried
to
cary
s
office
that
s
in
the
normal
routine
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
for
him
to
take
out
the
extra
things
he
has
ordered
punaro
in
collecting
rubbish
places
the
supplies
intended
for
german
subs
under
the
trash
in
his
dump
cart
and
later
hides
it
aboard
the
rubbish
and
beeson
asked
kitty
you
really
think
he
s
the
middleman
no
doubt
of
that
replied
captain
rogers
he
probably
carts
off
quite
a
bit
of
fresh
food
with
him
when
he
comes
for
scraps
for
his
that
s
just
what
we
figured
said
kitty
and
i
suppose
hazel
dawson
was
right
about
lieutenant
cary
playing
chess
with
krome
to
keep
him
occupied
while
punaro
gets
away
with
the
dirty
work
in
the
galley
no
doubt
that
s
been
his
while
they
had
been
talking
the
fury
of
the
wind
had
increased
carter
kept
glancing
uneasily
toward
the
rattling
windows
captain
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
think
i
d
better
go
back
to
our
bungalow
and
bring
my
little
boy
and
his
nurse
here
this
wind
is
reaching
an
alarming
yes
yes
of
course
they
say
it
s
likely
to
reach
hurricane
proportions
by
carter
got
up
quickly
i
m
afraid
it
s
going
to
be
ahead
of
schedule
our
small
cottage
is
no
place
to
spend
the
kitty
threw
aside
the
old
sweater
and
jumped
to
her
feet
frightened
for
billy
no
dear
you
d
better
not
come
with
me
no
use
for
you
to
get
wet
again
said
her
father
you
ve
been
through
enough
for
one
day
hazel
is
on
night
duty
you
can
get
some
sleep
in
her
yes
young
lady
you
mustn
t
take
any
more
chances
we
may
need
you
here
in
the
morning
anyhow
to
answer
further
i
ll
stop
by
and
tell
hazel
you
re
going
to
her
room
said
her
father
when
they
started
out
i
ll
arrange
for
billy
and
jane
somehow
here
restrictions
will
be
let
down
for
such
an
emergency
so
you
just
put
everything
out
of
your
mind
and
get
some
chapter
twenty
rewards
carter
s
orders
for
kitty
to
put
all
worries
out
of
her
mind
and
sleep
were
easier
given
than
followed
she
knew
that
very
well
as
she
entered
hazel
s
room
she
thought
a
hot
bath
would
do
her
more
good
than
anything
else
there
were
plenty
of
fresh
towels
on
the
rack
in
the
bathroom
and
kitty
was
sure
her
friend
would
want
her
to
make
herself
at
home
she
was
just
rubbing
down
after
a
relaxing
soak
when
she
heard
someone
come
in
that
you
hazel
she
called
yes
your
dad
told
me
you
were
here
i
came
as
soon
as

helped
myself
to

you
re
more
than
welcome
darling
i
ll
get
you
something
to
sleep
a
moment
later
a
pair
of
flowered
pajamas
were
thrust
inside
the
bathroom
door
when
kitty
came
out
arrayed
in
the
sleeping
garments
two
sizes
too
large
for
her
hazel

the
cover
already
turned
down
on
the
bed
you
hop
right
in
and
i
ll
tuck

angel

easy
till

the

putting
up
cots
in
the
recreation
room
and
library
for
other
people
everyone
on
the
island

been
ordered
to
take
refuge
in
the
larger
buildings
they
say
none
of
the
cottages

be
safe
by
there

be
lots
for
the
canteen

in
hers
and

beside

bed
as
she
handed

cup

said
softly

ll
seem
almost
like
having
my
own
mother
again
hazel
to
have
quick
tears
welled
in
her
friend
s
eyes
nothing
you
could
have
said
would
make
me
feel
more
welcome
with
a
quick
movement
hazel
brushed
the
tears
aside
and
said
now
i
must
hurry
back
to
my
ward
i
ll
see
you
in
the
as
kitty
settled
down
on
the
pillow
she
had
no
idea
she
could
sleep
even
if
her
mind
had
not
been
so
full
of
things
to
think
about
the
howling
wind
was
enough
to
keep
anyone
awake
she
had
not
realized
how
utterly
weary
she
was
until
she
sank
into
that
soft
bed
the
bath
and
the
warm
milk
seemed
to
have
magic
effect
for
almost
at
once
she
felt
drowsy
and
soon
slept
illustration
oh
hazel
kitty
said
i
m
delighted
when
she
roused
the
shades
were
drawn
but
she
could
see
it
was
day
the
wind
was
still
blowing
but
not
with
such
fury
as
when
she
had
gone
to
sleep
she
glanced
at
the
bedside
clock
and
was
shocked
to
see
it
was
hazel
should
have
long
since
had
her
turn
in
the
bed
when
she
sat
up
she
saw
her
two
suitcases
on
the
floor
all
stuck
over
with
labels
from
her
college
days
dear
old
dad
he
thought
of
everything
at
least
she
would
now
have
something
to
wear
if
their
cottage
had
blown
down
during
the
night
her
first
thought
on
waking
had
been
of
brad
how
had
he
fared
through
the
night
she
found
her
yellow
and
blue
plaid
skirt
and
a
blue
sweater
among
the
things
her
father
had
brought
she
had
dressed
and
was
just
brushing
her
hair
when
she
heard
someone
at
the
door
and
turned
to
see
hazel
i
feel
terrible
that
i
slept
so
late
kitty
exclaimed
i
m
delighted
you
could
sleep
i
put
just
a
bit
of
sleeping
powder
in
that
milk
last
night
i
was
sure
you
d
need
oh
you
did
guess
i
wouldn
t
have
slept
without
it
my
mind
was
in
such
a
turmoil
how
s
brad
much
better
he
wants
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
wake
room
eighteen
third
oh
i
m
so
kitty
gave
a
final
flip
to
her
hair
and
turned
to
hazel
you
look
fresh
as
ever
where
did
you
sleep
oh
i
had
a
good
rest
in
elsie
s
room
while
she
was
on
she
sat
down
near
the
window
your
dad
and
i
had
a
long
talk
over
our
breakfast
he
told
me
everything
you
ve
been
a
wonder
but
i
won
t
feel
easy
till
punaro
and
beeson
are
captured
did
they
arrest
punaro
last
night
hazel
shook
her
head
no
he
didn
t
come
seems
no
doubt
he
was
the
one
who
shot
the
fbi
have
gone
out
now
in
a
powerful
motorboat
the
wind
is
down
enough
for
them
to
take
a
chance
they
re
afraid
to
wait
too
long
for
fear
the
pair
will
get
did
the
storm
do
much
damage
on
the
island
i
hate
to
tell
you
how
much
dear
you
can
get
a
view
of
the
destruction
from
brad
s
kitty
was
instantly
alert
then
we
ll
need
every
canteen
worker
on
the
island
i
must
try
to
get
in
touch
with
evans
i
suppose
all
the
wires
are
oh
yes
but
evans
and
her
family
slept
in
the
recreation
hall
she
asked
me
to
tell
you
to
report
to
the
uso
as
soon
as
glad
to
know
it
weathered
the
kitty
couldn
t
go
anywhere
until
she
saw
for
herself
how
brad
was
the
nurse
was
just
propping
him
up
for
his
dinner
as
kitty
entered
surely
is
grand
to
see
you
eating
brad
she
said
happily
when
she
went
in
though
his
left
arm
was
bound
against
his
body
he
could
feed
himself
with
his
right
hand
that
transfusion
put
the
kick
right
back
into
me
brad
said
sorry
i
was
such
a
nuisance
last
don
t
be
silly
she
followed
the
nurse
to
the
door
and
closed
it
tightly
brad
the
whole
thing
came
to
a
climax
last
night
feel
able
to
hear
about
it
sorry
you
don
t
get
the
privilege
kit
but
chief
carter
and
captain
rogers
were
in
here
a
couple
of
hours
ago
they
told
me
everything
you
ve
really
been
super
through
it
i
m
glad
they
talked
with
you
hazel
told
me
they
ve
gone
out
to
terrapin
island
now
to
get
beeson
and
punaro
sure
hope
no
harm
comes
to
uncle
mose
before
they
get
hope
so
too
we
can
use
the
old
darky
when
we
build
our
summer
cottage
in
the
pine
our
summer
cottage
in
the
pine
thicket
exclaimed
kitty
and
laughed
suddenly
oh
brad
what
a
dreamer
you
are
they
must
have
you
sort
of
doped
but
he
was
entirely
himself
as
he
looked
at
her
seriously
really
kit
wouldn
t
you
like
that
i
think
i
would
brad
she
replied
just
as
seriously
but
we
ve
an
awful
lot
to
do
oh
of
course
we
ve
got
to
finish
this
big
job
and
i
can
t
stay
here
long
now
there
s
work
to
be
done
down
she
moved
toward
the
window
as
she
spoke
a
few
blocks
away
she
could
see
where
the
storm
had
struck
with
full
force
it
looked
as
though
a
giant
mowing
machine
might
have
laid
everything
level
in
its
path
oh
our
cottage
is
ruined
she
burst
forth
sorry
kit
your
dad
told
me
about
how
happy
they
had
been
there
she
thought
but
of
course
they
had
owned
neither
the
house
nor
the
furniture
so
their
loss
was
nothing
to
compare
with
that
of
many
others
near
by
and
they
would
be
needing
her
services
right
now
there
were
many
hungry
mouths
to
feed
and
she
must
hurry
off
to
her
canteen
work
this
was
no
time
to
dream
of
a
bright
future
or
stop
to
talk
over
a
troubled
past
a
few
minutes
later
she
ate
a
hasty
lunch
with
her
father
and
billy
before
she
put
on
her
canteen
uniform
to
report
for
duty
at
the
uso
the
wind
was
still
too
high
for
them
to
feed
the
homeless
outdoors
so
the
hall
was
turned
into
an
emergency
kitty
worked
hard
all
day
and
until
the
last
dish
was
washed
that
night
it
was
almost
twelve
o
clock
when
she
finally
returned
to
the
hospital
to
get
a
few
hours
sleep
in
hazel
s
bed
she
was
roused
next
morning
by
hazel
standing
by
her
bed
i
m
going
to
have
breakfast
with
your
father
wouldn
t
you
like
to
come
along
yes
indeed
kitty
was
out
of
bed
with
a
bound
and
soon
had
on
her
clothes
anything
develop
while
i
was
away
yesterday
she
asked
very
satisfactory
development
they
got
beeson
all
how
about
uncle
mose
he
was
quite
safe
in
his
cabin
so
they
left
him
that
s
a
relief
what
about
punaro
he
wasn
t
on
terrapin
island
or
mangrove
either
there
s
a
possibility
his
boat
went
down
in
the
storm
when
he
tried
to
return
perhaps
get
to
terrapin
island
they
found
the
the
rifle
exclaimed
kitty
the
one
that
shot
the
slug
into
brad
it
was
in
a
cache
on
mangrove
island
along
with
several
boxes
of
medicine
and
hospital
supplies
the
stuff
all
bore
punaro
s
the
gun
too
hazel
nodded
the
whole
seems
quite
clear
now
she
continued
the
germans
have
evidently
been
coming
in
as
far
as
mangrove
island
in
their
rubber
boat
there
they
change
to
different
clothes
and
an
old
bateau
kept
hidden
in
the
mangroves
in
case
they
meet
anyone
on
their
way
to
the
same
boat
the
boys
found
in
the
mangroves
i
no
doubt
it
was
they
found
enormous
supplies
of
canned
goods
and
other
foods
stored
at
beeson
s
makes
me
shiver
now
that
i
really
know
what
chances
we
took
said
kitty
when
they
were
ready
to
go
down
and
well
you
may
shiver
my
child
it
s
a
miracle
you
came
through
it
with
a
whole
poor
brad
didn
oh
brad
ll
be
all
right
he
s
going
to
have
breakfast
with
not
really
a
few
minutes
later
they
found
her
father
brad
and
billy
waiting
for
them
in
the
what
a
wonderful
family
reunion
exclaimed
kitty
when
they
had
been
served
chief
carter
leaned
across
the
table
and
skid
to
his
daughter
kitten
i
have
a
nice
surprise
for
oh
dad
i
don
t
know
if
i
can
stand
any
more
first

nip
this
saboteur
business
in
the
bud
then
i
hear
that
you
and
hazel
are
going
to
be
married
brad
talks
deliriously
about
building
us
a
summer
home
in
the
pines
on
terrapin
now
it
s
our
turn
to
be
surprised
isn
t
it
hazel
exclaimed
her
father
well
not
exactly
my
eyes
have
been
open
for
quite
a
but
now
you
talk
of
another
surprise
said
kitty
and
this
includes
you
both
said
chief
carter
suddenly
growing
serious
again

rogers

just
told
me
that
you
both
will
be
given
service
awards
for
special
help
to
your
oh
dad
not
really
i
didn
t
do
anything
but
get
shot
exclaimed
brad
but
kitty
could
see
a
slight
color
rising
in
his
pale
cheeks
you
did
so
i
couldn
t
have
done
anything
without
well
we
won
t
have
any
argument
over
that

both

to
recognition
