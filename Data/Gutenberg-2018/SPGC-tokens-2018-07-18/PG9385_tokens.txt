what

said
betty
from
the
heart
we
introduced
now
do
be
cross
she
said
betty
stared
at
him
coldly
betty
looked
nervously
around
the
scene
was
agitatingly
unfamiliar
unfinished
but
a
disquieting
likeness
thank
you
it
all
done
now
on
the
further
arm
of
the
chair
sat
laughing
also
a
very
pretty
young
woman
the
next
morning
brought
him
a
letter
book
the
girl
chapter
i
the
inevitable
no
the
chemises
are
cut
out
i
have
had
time
there

enough
shirts
to
go
on
with
are
there
mrs
james
said
betty
we
can
make
do
for
this
afternoon
miss
but
the
men
they
getting
blowed
out
with
shirts
it
the
children
shifts
as
we
ca
make
shift
without
much
longer
james
habitually
doleful
punctuated
her
speech
with
sniffs
that
a
joke
james
said
betty
how
clever
you
are
i
try
to
be
what
fitting
said
james
complacently
talk
of
fitting
said
betty
if
you
like
i
fit
on
that
black
bodice
for
you
symes
if
the
other
ladies
do
mind
waiting
for
the
reading
a
little
bit
i
as
lief
talk
as
read
myself
said
a
woman
books
ai
what
they
was
in
my
young
days
if
it
the
same
to
you
miss
said
symes
in
a
thick
rich
voice
i
not
be
tried
on
afore
a
room
full
if
we
are
poor
we
can
all
be
clean
what
i
say
and
i
keeps
my
unders
as
i
keeps
my
outside
but
not
before
persons
as
has
real
imitation
lace
on
their
petticoat
bodies
i
see
them
when
i
was
her
with
her
fourth
no
miss
and
thanking
you
kindly
but
begging
your
pardon
all
the
same
do
mention
it
said
betty
absently
oh
smith
you
have
lost
your
thimble
already
why
what
that
you
got
in
your
mouth
so
it
is
smith
face
beamed
at
the
gratifying
coincidence
it
always
was
my
habit
from
a
child
to
put
things
there
for
safety
these
cheap
thimbles
ai
fit
to
put
in
your
mouth
no
more
than
coppers
said
james
her
mouth
full
of
pins
oh
nothing
hurts
you
if
you
like
it
said
betty
recklessly
she
had
been
reading
the
works
of
chesterton
a
shocked
murmur
arose
oh
miss
what
about
the
publy
kows
said
symes
heavily
the
others
nodded
acquiescence
do
you
think
we
might
have
a
window
open
said
betty
the
may
sunshine
beat
on
the
schoolroom
windows
the
room
crowded
with
the
stout
members
of
the
mother
meeting
and
mutual
clothing
club
was
stuffy
unbearable
a
murmur
arose
far
more
shocked
than
the
first
i
was
just
to
say
why
not
close
the
door
that
being
what
doors
is
made
for
after
all
said
symes
i
feel
a
sort
of
draught
up
my
legs
as
it
is
the
door
was
shut
you
ca
be
too
careful
said
the
woman
we
never
know
what
a
chill
may
bring
forth
my
cousin
she
had
twins
and
her
aunt
come
in
and
says
she
a
bit
stuffy
here
ai
you
and
with
that
she
opens
the
window
a
crack
not
meaning
no
harm
miss
as
it
might
be
you
and
within
a
year
that
poor
unfortunate
woman
she
popped
off
when
least
expected
gas
ulsters
the
doctor
said
which
it
what
you
call
chills
if
you
a
doctor
and
ca
speak
plain
my
poor
grandmother
come
to
her
end
the
same
way
said
smith
only
with
her
it
was
the
bible
reader
as
did
shut
the
door
through
being
so
set
on
shewing
off
her
reading
and
my
granny
a
clot
of
blood
went
to
her
brain
and
her
brain
went
to
her
head
and
she
was
a
corpse
inside
of
fifty
minutes
every
woman
in
the
room
was
waiting
feverishly
alert
for
the
pause
that
should
allow
her
to
begin
her
own
detailed
narrative
of
disease
james
was
easily
first
in
the
competition
them
quick
deaths
she
said
is
sometimes
a
blessing
in
disguise
to
both
parties
concerned
my
poor
husband
years
upon
years
he
lingered
and
he
had
a
bad
leg
talk
of
bad
legs
i
wish
you
could
all
have
seen
it
she
added
generously
was
it
the
kind
that
keeps
all
on
out
asked
symes
hastily
because
my
youngest
brother
had
a
leg
that
nothing
stop
break
out
it
would
do
what
they
might
i
sure
the
bandages
i
took
off
him
in
a
morning
betty
clapped
her
hands
it
was
the
signal
that
the
reading
was
going
to
begin
and
the
matrons
looked
at
her
resentfully
what
call
had
people
to
start
reading
when
the
talk
was
flowing
so
free
and
pleasant
betty
rather
pale
began
this
is
a
story
about
a
little
boy
called
wee
willie
winkie
i
call
that
a
silly
sort
of
name
whispered
smith
did
he
make
a
good
end
miss
asked
james
plaintively
you
see
said
betty
i
like
it
best
when
they
dies
forgiving
of
everybody
and
singing
hymns
to
the
last
and
when
they
says
i
shall
meet
you
in
the
better
land
that
what
makes
you
cry
so
pleasant
do
you
want
me
to
read
or
not
asked
betty
in
desperation
yes
miss
yes
hummed
the
voices
heavy
and
shrill
it
her
hobby
poor
young
thing
whispered
smith
we
all
my
own
is
a
light
cake
to
my
tea
and
always
was
ush
betty
read
when
the
mothers
had
wordily
gone
she
threw
open
the
windows
propped
the
door
wide
with
a
chair
and
went
to
tea
she
had
it
alone
your
pa
out
said
letitia
bumping
down
the
tray
in
front
of
her
that
a
anyhow
said
betty
to
herself
and
she
propped
up
a
stevenson
against
the
after
tea
parishioners
strolled
up
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
to
change
their
books
at
the
vicarage
lending
library
the
books
were
covered
with
black
calico
and
smelt
of
rooms
whose
windows
were
never
opened
when
she
had
washed
the
smell
of
the
books
off
she
did
her
hair
very
carefully
in
a
new
way
that
seemed
becoming
and
went
down
to
supper
her
only
spoke
once
during
the
meal
he
was
luxuriating
in
the
thought
of
the
of
aquinas
in
leather
still
brown
and
beautiful
which
he
had
providentially
discovered
in
the
of
an
ailing
parishioner
when
he
did
speak
he
said
how
extremely
untidy
your
hair
is
lizzie
i
wish
you
would
take
more
pains
with
your
appearance
when
he
had
withdrawn
to
his
books
she
covered
three
new
volumes
for
the
library
the
black
came
off
on
her
hands
but
anyway
it
was
clean
dirt
she
went
to
bed
early
and
that
my
life
she
said
as
she
blew
out
the
candle
said
james
to
symes
over
the
last
and
strongest
cup
of
tea
miss
betty
ailing
a
bit
i
fancy
looked
a
bit
peaky
it
seemed
to
me
i
should
wonder
if
she
was
to
go
off
in
a
decline
like
her
father
did
it
was
no
decline
said
symes
dropping
her
thick
voice
was
cut
off
in
the
midst
of
his
wicked
courses
a
judgment
if
ever
there
was
one
betty
blameless
father
had
been
killed
in
the
hunting
field
i
daresay
she
takes
after
him
only
being
a
female
it
all
turns
to
her
being
pernickety
in
her
food
and
allus
wanting
the
windows
open
and
mark
my
words
it
may
turn
into
a
decline
yet
symes
my
dear
symes
laughed
fatly
that
ai
no
decline
she
said
you
take
it
from
me
what
miss
betty
wants
is
a
young
man
it
is
but
nature
after
all
and
what
we
must
all
come
to
gentle
or
simple
give
her
a
young
man
to
walk
out
with
and
you
see
the
difference
decline
indeed
a
young
man
what
she
wants
and
if
i
know
anything
of
gells
and
their
ways
she
get
one
no
matter
how
close
the
old
chap
keeps
her
symes
was
not
so
wrong
as
the
delicate
minded
may
suppose
betty
did
indeed
desire
to
fall
in
love
in
all
the
story
books
the
main
interest
of
the
heroine
career
began
with
that
event
not
that
she
voiced
the
desire
to
herself
only
once
she
voiced
it
in
her
prayers
oh
god
she
said
do
please
let
something
happen
that
was
all
a
girl
had
her
little
reticences
even
with
herself
even
with
her
creator
next
morning
she
planned
to
go
sketching
but
no
there
were
three
more
detestable
books
to
be
put
into
nasty
little
black
cotton
coats
the
to
be
dusted
all
the
hateful
china
the
peas
to
be
shelled
for
dinner
she
shelled
the
peas
in
the
garden
it
was
a
beautiful
green
garden
and
lovers
could
have
walked
very
happily
down
the
paths
oh
how
sick
i
am
of
it
all
said
betty
she
would
not
say
even
to
herself
that
what
she
hated
was
the
frame
without
the
picture
as
she
carried
in
the
peas
she
passed
the
open
window
of
the
study
where
among
shelves
of
dull
books
and
dusty
pamphlets
her
had
as
usual
forgotten
his
sermon
in
a
chain
of
references
to
the
fathers
betty
saw
his
thin
white
hairs
his
hard
narrow
face
and
tight
mouth
the
hands
yellow
and
that
gripped
the
thin
vellum
folio
i
suppose
even
he
was
young
once
she
said
but
i
sure
he
remember
it
he
saw
her
go
by
young
and
alert
in
the
sunshine
and
the
may
air
stirred
the
curtains
he
looked
vaguely
about
him
unlocked
a
drawer
in
his
and
took
out
a
leather
case
he
gazed
long
at
the
face
within
a
young
bright
face
with
long
ringlets
above
the
formal
bodice
and
sloping
shoulders
of
the
sixties
well
well
he
said
well
well
locked
it
away
and
went
back
to
poenis
i
go
out
said
betty
as
she
parted
with
the
peas
i
care
it
was
not
worth
while
to
change
one
frock
even
when
one
was
properly
dressed
at
rare
local
or
one
never
met
anyone
that
mattered
she
fetched
her
sketching
things
at
eighteen
one
does
so
pathetically
try
to
feed
the
burgeoning
life
with
the
husks
of
polite
accomplishment
she
insisted
on
withholding
from
the
clutches
of
the
parish
the
time
to
practise
beethoven
and
sullivan
for
an
hour
daily
daily
for
half
an
hour
she
read
an
improving
book
just
now
it
was
the
french
revolution
and
betty
thought
it
would
last
till
she
was
sixty
she
tried
to
read
french
and
german
télémaque
and
maria
stuart
she
fully
intended
to
become
all
that
a
cultured
young
woman
should
be
but
is
a
dull
game
when
there
is
no
one
to
applaud
your
score
what
the
gardener
called
the
gravel
path
was
black
earth
very
pretty
but
betty
thought
it
shabby
it
was
soft
and
cool
though
to
the
feet
and
the
dust
of
the
white
road
sparkled
like
diamond
dust
in
the
sunlight
she
crossed
the
road
and
passed
through
the
swing
gate
into
the
park
where
the
grass
was
up
for
hay
with
red
sorrel
and
buttercups
and
tall
daisies
and
feathery
flowered
grasses
their
colours
all
tangled
and
blended
together
like
ravelled
ends
of
silk
on
the
wrong
side
of
some
great
square
of
tapestry
here
and
there
in
the
wide
sweep
of
tall
growing
things
stood
a
tree
a
shining
like
silver
a
laburnum
like
fine
gold
there
were
whose
spires
of
blossom
shewed
like
fat
candles
on
a
christmas
tree
for
giant
children
and
the
sun
was
warm
and
the
tree
shadows
black
on
the
grass
betty
told
herself
that
she
hated
it
all
she
took
the
narrow
path
the
grasses
met
above
her
feet
crossed
the
park
and
reached
the
rabbit
warren
where
the
chalk
breaks
through
the
thin
dry
turf
and
the
wild
thyme
grows
thick
a
may
bush
overhanging
a
little
precipice
of
chalk
caught
her
eye
a
wild
rose
was
tangled
round
it
it
was
without
doubt
the
most
difficult
composition
within
sight
i
will
sketch
that
said
eighteen
confidently
for
half
an
hour
she
busily
blotted
and
washed
and
niggled
then
she
became
aware
that
she
no
longer
had
the
rabbit
warren
to
herself
and
he
an
artist
too
said
betty
how
awfully
interesting
i
wish
i
could
see
his
face
but
this
his
slouched
panama
forbade
he
was
in
white
the
sleeve
and
breast
of
his
painting
jacket
smeared
with
many
colours
he
had
a
and
an
easel
and
looked
she
could
not
help
feeling
much
more
like
a
real
artist
than
she
did
hunched
up
as
she
was
on
a
little
mound
of
turf
in
her
shabby
pink
gown
and
that
hateful
garden
hat
with
last
year
dusty
flattened
roses
in
it
she
went
on
sketching
with
feverish
unskilled
fingers
and
a
pulse
that
had
actually
quickened
its
beat
she
cast
little
glances
at
him
as
often
as
she
dared
he
was
certainly
a
real
artist
she
could
tell
that
by
the
very
way
he
held
his
palette
was
he
staying
with
people
about
there
should
she
meet
him
would
they
ever
be
introduced
to
each
other
oh
what
a
pity
said
betty
from
the
heart
that
we
introduced
her
sketch
grew
worse
and
worse
it
no
good
she
said
i
ca
do
anything
with
it
she
glanced
at
him
he
had
pushed
back
the
hat
she
saw
quite
plainly
that
he
was
smiling
a
very
little
but
he
smiling
also
he
was
looking
at
her
and
across
the
fifteen
yards
of
gray
turf
their
eyes
met
and
she
knew
that
he
knew
that
this
was
not
her
first
glance
at
him
she
paled
with
fury
he
has
been
watching
me
all
the
time
he
is
making
fun
of
me
he
knows
i
ca
sketch
of
course
he
can
see
it
by
the
silly
way
i
hold
everything
she
ran
her
knife
around
her
sketch
detached
it
and
tore
it
across
and
across
the
stranger
raised
his
hat
and
called
eagerly
i
say
please
do
move
for
a
minute
do
you
mind
i
just
got
your
pink
gown
it
coming
beautifully
between
brother
artists
do
please
do
sit
still
and
go
on
sketching
ah
do
betty
attitude
petrified
instantly
she
held
a
brush
in
her
hand
and
she
looked
down
at
her
block
but
she
did
not
go
on
sketching
she
sat
rigid
and
three
delicious
words
rang
in
her
ears
between
brother
artists
how
very
nice
of
him
he
had
been
making
fun
after
all
but
was
it
rather
impertinent
of
him
to
put
her
in
his
picture
without
asking
her
well
it
was
she
but
her
pink
gown
he
wanted
and
between
brother
artists
betty
drew
a
long
breath
it
no
use
he
called
do
bother
any
more
the
pose
is
gone
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
he
came
towards
her
let
me
see
the
sketch
he
said
why
did
you
tear
it
up
he
fitted
the
pieces
together
why
it
quite
good
you
ought
to
study
in
paris
he
added
idly
she
took
the
torn
papers
from
his
hand
with
a
bow
and
turned
to
go
do
go
he
said
you
not
going
do
you
want
to
look
at
my
picture
now
betty
knew
as
well
as
you
do
that
you
mus
speak
to
people
unless
you
been
introduced
to
them
but
the
phrase
brother
artists
had
played
ninepins
with
her
little
conventions
thank
you
i
should
like
to
very
much
said
betty
i
do
care
she
said
to
herself
and
besides
it
not
as
if
he
were
a
young
man
or
a
tourist
or
anything
he
must
be
ever
so
old
thirty
i
wonder
if
he
was
when
she
saw
the
picture
she
merely
said
oh
and
stood
at
gaze
for
it
a
picture
a
picture
that
seen
in
foreign
lands
might
well
make
one
sick
with
longing
for
the
dry
turf
and
the
pale
dog
violets
that
love
the
chalk
for
the
hum
of
the
bees
and
the
scent
of
the
thyme
he
had
chosen
the
bold
sweep
of
the
brown
upland
against
the
sky
and
low
to
the
left
where
the
line
broke
the
dim
violet
of
the
kentish
hills
in
the
green
foreground
the
pink
figure
just
roughly
blocked
in
was
blocked
in
by
a
hand
that
knew
its
trade
and
was
artist
to
the
tips
of
its
fingers
oh
said
betty
again
yes
said
he
i
think
i
got
it
this
time
i
think
it
make
a
hole
in
the
wall
eh
yes
it
is
good
yes
said
betty
oh
yes
do
you
often
go
he
asked
how
modest
he
is
thought
betty
he
changes
the
subject
so
as
not
to
seem
to
want
to
be
praised
aloud
she
answered
with
shy
fluttered
earnestness
yes
no
i
know
sometimes
his
lips
were
grave
but
there
was
the
light
behind
his
eyes
that
goes
with
a
smile
what
unnecessary
agitation
he
was
thinking
poor
little
thing
i
suppose
she
never
seen
a
man
before
oh
these
country
girls
aloud
he
was
saying
this
is
such
a
perfect
country
you
ought
to
sketch
every
day
i
no
one
to
teach
me
said
betty
innocently
phrasing
a
want
the
man
raised
his
eyebrows
well
after
that
here
goes
he
said
to
himself
i
wish
you
let
teach
you
he
said
to
her
beginning
to
put
his
traps
together
oh
i
did
mean
that
said
betty
in
real
distress
what
would
he
think
of
her
how
greedy
and
grasping
she
must
seem
i
did
mean
that
at
all
no
but
i
do
he
said
but
you
a
great
artist
said
betty
watching
him
with
clasped
hands
i
suppose
it
would
be
i
mean
do
you
know
we
not
rich
and
i
suppose
your
lessons
are
worth
pounds
and
pounds
i
do
give
lessons
for
money
his
lips
tightened
only
for
love
that
means
nothing
does
it
she
said
and
flushed
to
find
herself
on
the
defensive
feebly
against
nothing
at
tennis
yes
he
said
and
to
himself
he
added
my
dear
but
you
did
it
very
prettily
but
i
could
let
you
give
me
lessons
for
nothing
why
not
he
asked
and
his
calmness
made
betty
feel
ashamed
and
sordid
i
do
know
she
answered
tremulously
but
i
do
think
my
would
want
me
to
you
think
it
would
annoy
him
i
sure
it
would
if
he
knew
about
it
betty
was
thinking
how
little
her
had
ever
cared
to
know
of
her
and
her
interests
but
the
man
caught
the
ball
as
he
saw
it
then
why
let
him
know
was
the
next
move
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
betty
move
of
rejoinder
came
with
a
readiness
born
of
some
practice
at
the
game
oh
she
said
innocently
i
never
thought
of
that
but
would
it
be
wrong
she
got
the
whole
thing
stereotyped
but
it
dainty
type
anyhow
he
thought
of
course
it
would
be
wrong
he
said
it
hurt
him
do
you
know
that
nothing
wrong
unless
it
hurts
somebody
yes
she
said
eagerly
that
what
i
think
but
all
the
same
it
does
seem
fair
that
you
should
take
all
that
trouble
for
me
and
get
nothing
in
return
well
played
we
getting
on
he
thought
and
added
aloud
but
perhaps
i
sha
get
nothing
in
return
her
eyes
dropped
over
the
wonderful
thought
that
perhaps
she
might
do
something
for
but
what
she
looked
straight
at
him
and
the
innocent
appeal
sent
a
tiny
thorn
of
doubt
through
his
armour
of
complacency
was
she
after
all
no
no
novice
could
play
the
game
so
well
and
yet
i
would
do
anything
i
could
you
know
she
said
eagerly
because
it
is
so
awfully
kind
of
you
and
i
do
so
want
to
be
able
to
paint
what
can
i
do
what
can
you
do
he
asked
and
brought
his
face
a
little
nearer
to
the
pretty
flushed
freckled
face
under
the
shabby
hat
her
eyes
met
his
he
felt
a
quick
relenting
and
drew
back
well
for
one
thing
you
could
let
me
paint
your
portrait
betty
was
silent
come
play
up
you
little
duffer
he
urged
inwardly
when
she
spoke
her
voice
trembled
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
she
said
and
you
will
oh
i
will
indeed
i
will
how
good
and
sweet
you
are
he
said
then
there
was
a
silence
betty
tightened
the
strap
of
her
sketching
things
and
said
i
think
i
ought
to
go
home
now
he
had
the
appropriate
counter
ready
ah
do
go
yet
he
said
let
us
sit
down
see
that
bank
is
quite
in
the
shade
now
and
tell
me
tell
you
what
she
asked
for
he
had
made
the
artistic
pause
oh
anything
anything
about
yourself
betty
was
as
incapable
of
flight
as
any
bird
on
a
limed
twig
she
walked
beside
him
to
the
bank
and
sat
down
at
his
bidding
and
he
lay
at
her
feet
looking
up
into
her
eyes
he
asked
idle
questions
she
answered
them
with
a
conscientious
tremulous
truthfulness
that
showed
to
him
as
the
most
finished
art
and
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
fortunate
accident
that
he
should
have
found
here
in
this
unlikely
spot
so
accomplished
a
player
at
his
favorite
game
yet
it
was
the
variety
of
his
game
for
which
he
cared
least
he
did
not
greatly
relish
a
skilled
adversary
betty
told
him
nervously
and
in
words
everything
that
he
asked
to
know
but
all
the
while
the
undercurrent
of
questions
rang
strong
within
her
when
is
he
to
teach
me
where
how
so
that
when
at
last
there
was
left
but
the
bare
fifteen
minutes
needed
to
get
one
home
in
time
for
the
midday
dinner
she
said
abruptly
and
when
shall
i
see
you
again
you
take
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
said
he
and
indeed
she
had
she
has
no
yet
he
told
himself
she
might
have
left
that
move
to
me
the
lessons
you
know
said
betty
and
and
the
picture
if
you
really
do
want
to
do
it
if
i
want
to
do
it
you
know
i
want
to
do
it
yes
it
like
the
nursery
game
how
when
and
where
well
as
to
the
how
i
can
paint
and
you
can
learn
the
where
there
a
circle
of
pines
in
the
wood
here
you
know
it
a
sort
of
giant
fairy
ring
she
did
know
it
now
for
the
when
and
that
the
most
important
i
should
like
to
paint
you
in
the
early
morning
when
the
day
is
young
and
innocent
and
beautiful
like
like
he
was
careful
to
break
off
in
a
most
natural
seeming
embarrassment
that
a
bit
thick
but
she
swallow
it
all
right
gone
down
right
he
told
himself
i
could
come
out
at
six
if
you
liked
or
or
five
said
betty
humbly
anxious
to
do
her
part
he
was
almost
shocked
my
good
child
he
told
her
silently
someone
really
ought
to
teach
you
not
to
do
all
the
running
you
do
give
a
man
a
chance
then
will
you
meet
me
here
at
six
he
said
you
disappoint
me
will
you
he
added
tenderly
no
said
downright
betty
i
be
sure
to
come
but
not
she
added
with
undisguised
regret
sunday
monday
then
said
he
and
and
oh
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
very
much
mistaken
if
you
do
he
said
as
he
stood
bareheaded
watching
the
pink
gown
out
of
sight
well
adventures
to
the
adventurous
a
clergyman
daughter
too
i
might
have
known
it
chapter
ii
the
irresistible
betty
had
to
run
all
the
way
home
and
then
she
was
late
for
dinner
her
dry
face
and
dusty
clothes
the
solid
comfort
of
the
mahogany
furnished
dining
room
the
warm
wet
scent
of
mutton
these
seemed
needed
to
wake
her
from
what
was
when
she
had
awakened
a
dream
the
open
sky
the
sweet
air
of
the
may
fields
and
already
the
stranger
was
him
to
betty
but
then
she
did
not
know
his
name
she
slipped
into
her
place
at
the
foot
of
the
long
white
dining
table
a
table
built
to
serve
a
dozen
guests
and
where
no
guests
ever
sat
save
rarely
a
curate
or
two
and
more
rarely
even
an
aunt
you
are
late
again
lizzie
said
her
yes
father
said
she
trying
to
hide
her
hands
and
the
fact
that
she
had
not
had
time
to
wash
them
a
long
streak
of
burnt
sienna
marked
one
finger
and
her
nails
had
little
slices
of
various
colours
in
them
her
was
always
hard
to
open
usually
underwood
saw
nothing
but
when
he
saw
anything
he
saw
everything
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
green
smudge
on
her
pink
sleeve
i
wish
you
would
contrive
to
keep
yourself
clean
or
else
wear
a
pinafore
he
said
betty
flushed
scarlet
i
very
sorry
she
said
but
it
only
water
colour
it
will
wash
out
you
are
nearly
twenty
are
you
not
the
vicar
inquired
with
the
dry
smile
that
always
infuriated
his
how
was
she
to
know
that
it
was
the
only
smile
he
knew
and
that
smiles
of
any
sort
had
long
grown
difficult
to
him
eighteen
she
said
it
is
almost
time
you
began
to
think
about
being
a
lady
this
was
badinage
no
failures
had
taught
the
reverend
cecil
that
his
had
an
ideal
of
him
in
which
badinage
had
no
place
she
merely
supposed
that
he
wished
to
be
disagreeable
she
kept
a
mutinous
silence
the
old
man
sighed
it
is
one
duty
to
correct
the
faults
of
one
child
but
it
is
not
pleasant
the
reverend
cecil
had
not
the
habit
of
shirking
any
duty
because
he
happened
to
dislike
it
the
mutton
was
taken
away
betty
her
whole
being
transfigured
by
the
emotions
of
the
morning
stirred
the
stewed
rhubarb
on
her
plate
she
felt
rising
in
her
a
sort
of
wild
forlorn
courage
why
should
she
speak
out
her
could
hate
her
more
than
he
did
whatever
she
said
he
might
even
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
she
spoke
suddenly
and
rather
loudly
before
she
knew
that
she
had
meant
to
speak
at
all
father
she
said
i
wish
you
let
me
go
to
paris
and
study
art
not
now
she
hurriedly
explained
with
a
sudden
vision
of
being
taken
at
her
word
and
packed
off
to
france
before
six
on
monday
morning
not
now
but
later
in
the
autumn
perhaps
i
would
work
very
hard
i
wish
you
let
me
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
at
her
with
wistful
kindness
she
read
in
his
glance
only
a
frozen
contempt
no
my
child
he
said
paris
is
a
sink
of
iniquity
i
passed
a
week
there
once
many
years
ago
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
great
exhibition
you
are
growing
discontented
lizzie
work
is
the
cure
for
that
symes
tells
me
that
the
chemises
for
the
mother
sewing
meetings
are
not
cut
out
yet
i
cut
them
out
they
have
finished
the
shirts
yet
anyway
said
betty
but
i
do
wish
you
just
think
about
paris
or
even
london
you
can
have
lessons
at
home
if
you
like
i
believe
there
are
excellent
in
sevenoaks
symes
was
recommending
one
of
them
to
me
only
the
other
day
with
certificates
from
the
high
school
i
seem
to
remember
her
saying
but
that
not
what
i
want
said
betty
with
a
courage
that
surprised
her
as
much
as
it
surprised
him
do
you
see
father
one
gets
older
every
day
and
presently
i
shall
be
quite
old
and
i
sha
have
been
anywhere
or
seen
anything
he
thought
he
laughed
indulgently
at
the
folly
of
youth
she
thought
his
laugh
the
most
contemptuous
the
cruelest
sound
in
the
world
he
does
deserve
that
i
should
tell
him
about
him
she
thought
and
i
wo
i
do
care
no
no
he
said
no
no
no
the
home
is
the
place
for
girls
the
safe
quiet
shelter
of
the
home
perhaps
some
day
your
husband
will
take
you
abroad
for
a
fortnight
now
and
then
if
you
manage
to
get
a
husband
that
is
he
had
seen
through
his
spectacles
her
flushed
prettiness
and
old
as
he
was
he
remembered
well
enough
how
a
face
like
hers
would
seem
to
a
young
man
eyes
of
course
she
would
get
a
husband
so
he
spoke
in
kindly
irony
and
she
hated
him
for
a
wanton
insult
try
to
do
your
duty
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
you
are
called
he
went
on
occupy
yourself
with
music
and
books
and
the
details
of
housekeeping
no
do
have
my
study
turned
out
he
added
in
haste
remembering
how
his
advice
about
household
details
had
been
followed
when
last
he
gave
it
do
be
a
discontented
child
go
and
cut
out
the
nice
little
chemises
this
seemed
to
him
almost
a
touch
of
kindly
humour
and
he
went
back
to
augustine
pleased
with
himself
betty
set
her
teeth
and
went
black
rage
in
her
heart
to
cut
out
the
hateful
little
chemises
she
dragged
the
great
roll
of
evil
smelling
grayish
unbleached
calico
from
the
schoolroom
cupboard
and
heaved
it
on
to
the
table
it
was
very
heavy
the
scissors
were
blunt
and
left
deep
indentations
on
finger
and
thumb
she
was
rather
pleased
that
the
scissors
hurt
so
much
father
does
care
a
single
bit
he
hates
me
she
said
and
i
hate
him
oh
i
do
she
would
not
think
of
the
morning
not
now
with
this
fire
of
impotent
resentment
burning
in
her
would
she
take
out
those
memories
and
look
at
them
those
were
not
thoughts
to
be
dragged
through
the
litter
of
unbleached
cotton
cuttings
she
worked
on
doggedly
completed
the
tale
of
hot
heavy
little
garments
gathered
up
the
pieces
into
the
basket
and
put
away
the
roll
not
till
the
paint
had
been
washed
from
her
hands
and
the
crumbled
print
dress
exchanged
for
a
quite
respectable
muslin
did
she
consciously
allow
the
morning
memories
to
come
out
and
meet
her
eyes
then
she
went
down
to
the
arbour
where
she
had
shelled
peas
only
that
morning
it
seems
years
and
years
ago
she
said
and
sitting
there
she
slowly
and
carefully
went
over
everything
what
he
had
said
what
she
had
said
there
were
some
things
she
could
not
quite
remember
but
she
remembered
enough
brother
artists
were
the
words
she
said
oftenest
to
herself
but
the
words
that
sank
themselves
were
young
and
innocent
and
beautiful
like
like
but
he
could
have
meant
me
of
course
she
told
herself
and
on
monday
she
would
see
him
again
and
he
would
give
her
a
lesson
sunday
was
incredibly
wearisome
her
class
had
never
been
so
tiresome
nor
so
soaked
in
in
church
she
was
shocked
to
find
herself
watching
from
her
pew
in
the
chancel
the
entry
of
late
comers
of
whom
he
was
not
one
no
afternoon
had
ever
been
half
so
long
she
wrote
up
her
diary
thursday
and
friday
were
quickly
chronicled
at
saturday
she
paused
long
pen
in
hand
and
then
wrote
very
quickly
i
went
out
sketching
and
met
a
gentleman
an
artist
he
was
very
kind
and
is
going
to
teach
me
to
paint
and
he
is
going
to
paint
my
portrait
i
do
not
like
him
particularly
he
is
rather
old
and
not
really
i
shall
not
tell
father
because
he
is
simply
hateful
to
me
i
am
going
to
meet
this
artist
at
it
will
be
dreadful
having
to
get
up
so
early
i
almost
wish
i
said
i
would
go
it
will
be
such
a
bother
then
she
hid
the
diary
in
a
drawer
under
her
confirmation
dress
and
veil
and
locked
the
drawer
carefully
he
was
not
at
church
in
the
evening
either
he
had
thought
of
it
but
decided
that
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
get
into
decent
clothes
i
shall
see
her
soon
enough
he
thought
curse
my
impulsive
generosity
six
forsooth
and
all
to
please
a
daughter
she
came
back
from
church
with
tired
steps
i
do
hope
i
not
going
to
be
ill
she
said
i
feel
so
odd
just
as
if
i
had
had
anything
to
eat
for
days
and
yet
i
not
a
bit
hungry
either
i
daresay
i
sha
wake
up
in
time
to
get
there
by
six
she
was
awake
before
five
she
woke
with
a
flutter
of
the
heart
what
was
it
had
anything
happened
was
anyone
ill
then
she
recognized
that
she
was
not
unhappy
and
she
felt
more
than
ever
as
though
it
were
days
since
she
had
had
anything
to
eat
oh
dear
said
betty
jumping
out
of
bed
i
going
out
to
meet
him
and
have
a
she
dressed
quickly
it
was
too
soon
to
start
not
for
anything
must
she
be
first
at
the
rendezvous
even
though
it
were
only
for
a
that
only
pulled
her
up
sharply
when
she
was
dressed
she
dug
out
the
diary
and
wrote
this
is
terrible
is
it
possible
that
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
i
do
know
ever
loved
that
loved
not
at
first
sight
it
is
a
most
frightful
tragedy
to
happen
to
one
and
at
my
age
too
what
a
long
life
of
loneliness
stretches
in
front
of
me
for
of
course
he
could
never
care
for
me
and
if
this
love
well
it
will
be
once
and
forever
with
me
i
know
that
my
nature
i
afraid
but
i
not
i
ca
be
but
i
never
felt
so
unlike
myself
i
feel
a
sort
of
calm
exultation
as
if
something
very
wonderful
was
very
near
me
dear
diary
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
have
you
to
tell
everything
to
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
certainly
be
late
she
had
to
creep
down
the
front
stairs
so
very
slowly
and
softly
in
order
that
she
might
not
awaken
her
she
had
so
carefully
and
silently
to
unfasten
a
window
and
creep
out
to
close
the
window
again
without
noise
lest
the
maids
should
hear
and
come
running
to
see
why
their
young
mistress
was
out
of
her
bed
at
that
hour
she
had
to
go
on
tiptoe
through
the
shrubbery
and
out
through
the
church
yard
one
could
climb
its
wall
and
get
into
the
park
that
way
so
as
not
to
meet
labourers
on
the
road
who
would
stare
to
see
her
alone
so
early
and
perhaps
follow
her
once
in
the
park
she
was
safe
her
shoes
and
her
skirts
were
wet
with
dew
she
made
haste
she
did
not
want
to
keep
him
waiting
but
she
was
first
at
the
rendezvous
after
all
she
sat
down
on
the
carpet
of
pine
needles
how
pretty
the
early
morning
was
the
sunlight
was
quite
different
from
the
evening
sunlight
so
much
lighter
and
brighter
and
the
shadows
were
different
she
tried
to
settle
on
a
point
of
view
for
her
sketch
the
sketch
he
was
to
help
her
with
her
thoughts
went
back
to
what
she
had
written
in
her
diary
if
that
be
true
she
must
be
very
very
careful
he
must
never
guess
it
never
she
would
be
very
cold
and
distant
and
polite
not
with
a
brother
artist
like
she
had
been
yesterday
it
was
all
very
difficult
indeed
even
if
it
really
did
turn
out
to
be
true
if
the
wonderful
thing
had
happened
to
her
if
she
really
was
in
love
she
would
not
try
a
bit
to
make
him
like
her
that
would
be
forward
and
horrid
she
would
never
try
to
attract
any
man
those
things
must
come
of
themselves
or
not
at
all
she
arranged
her
skirt
in
more
effective
folds
and
wondered
how
it
would
look
as
one
came
up
the
woodland
path
she
thought
it
would
look
rather
picturesque
it
was
a
nice
heliotrope
colour
it
would
look
like
a
giant
parma
violet
against
the
dark
green
background
she
hoped
her
hair
was
tidy
and
that
her
hat
was
not
very
crooked
however
little
one
desires
to
attract
one
may
at
least
wish
one
hat
to
be
straight
she
looked
for
the
twentieth
time
at
her
watch
the
serviceable
silver
watch
that
had
been
her
mother
six
and
he
had
not
come
well
when
he
did
come
she
would
pretend
she
had
only
just
got
there
or
how
would
it
be
if
she
gave
up
being
a
parma
violet
and
went
a
little
way
down
the
path
and
then
turned
back
when
she
heard
him
coming
she
walked
away
a
dozen
yards
and
stood
waiting
but
he
did
not
come
was
it
possible
that
he
was
not
coming
was
he
ill
lying
uncared
for
at
the
peal
of
bells
in
the
village
with
no
one
to
smooth
his
pillow
or
put
on
his
head
she
walked
a
hundred
yards
or
so
towards
the
village
on
the
spur
of
this
thought
or
perhaps
he
had
come
by
another
way
to
the
trysting
place
that
thought
drove
her
back
he
was
not
there
well
she
would
not
stay
any
longer
she
would
just
go
away
and
come
back
ever
so
much
later
and
let
him
have
a
taste
of
waiting
she
had
had
her
share
she
told
herself
as
she
almost
ran
from
the
spot
she
stopped
suddenly
but
suppose
he
did
wait
she
went
slowly
back
she
sat
down
again
schooled
herself
to
patience
what
an
idiot
she
had
been
like
any
of
course
he
had
never
meant
to
come
why
should
he
that
page
in
her
diary
called
out
to
her
to
come
home
and
burn
it
care
for
him
indeed
not
she
why
she
had
exchanged
ten
words
with
the
man
but
i
knew
it
was
all
nonsense
when
i
wrote
it
she
said
i
only
just
put
it
down
to
see
what
it
would
look
like
eustace
vernon
roused
himself
and
yawned
it
got
to
be
done
i
suppose
buck
up
you
feel
better
after
your
bath
jove
seven
will
she
have
waited
she
a
keen
player
if
she
has
it
just
worth
trying
i
suppose
the
church
clock
struck
the
as
he
turned
into
the
wood
something
palely
violet
came
towards
him
so
you
here
he
said
where
the
pink
frock
it
it
going
to
the
wash
said
a
stiff
and
stifled
voice
sorry
i
could
get
here
at
six
i
hope
you
did
wait
long
not
very
long
he
said
smiling
but
great
heavens
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
nothing
she
said
but
you
been
you
are
i
not
she
said
defiantly
besides
i
got
neuralgia
it
always
makes
me
look
like
that
my
aunt
he
thought
then
she
here
at
six
and
she
been
crying
because
i
was
and
oh
where
are
we
i
so
sorry
got
neuralgia
he
said
gently
but
i
awfully
glad
you
did
get
here
at
six
because
my
watch
was
wrong
and
i
only
just
got
here
and
i
should
never
have
forgiven
myself
if
you
waited
for
me
a
single
minute
is
the
neuralgia
better
now
yes
she
said
smiling
faintly
much
better
it
was
rather
sharp
while
it
lasted
though
yes
he
said
i
see
it
was
i
am
so
glad
you
did
come
but
i
was
so
certain
you
would
that
i
did
bring
any
of
my
traps
so
we
begin
the
picture
will
you
start
a
sketch
or
is
your
neuralgia
too
bad
he
knew
it
would
be
and
it
was
so
they
merely
sat
on
the
pine
carpet
and
talked
till
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
back
to
the
late
rectory
breakfast
they
told
each
other
their
names
that
day
betty
talked
very
carefully
it
was
most
important
that
he
should
think
well
of
her
her
manner
had
changed
as
she
had
promised
herself
it
should
do
if
she
found
she
cared
for
him
now
she
was
with
him
she
knew
of
course
that
she
did
not
care
at
all
what
had
made
her
so
wretched
no
so
angry
that
she
had
actually
cried
was
simply
the
idea
that
she
had
been
made
a
fool
of
that
she
had
kept
the
tryst
and
he
had
now
he
had
come
she
was
quite
calm
she
did
not
care
in
the
least
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
not
often
wrong
but
i
was
off
the
line
yesterday
all
that
does
count
we
take
a
fresh
deal
and
start
fair
she
does
know
the
game
elle
a
des
she
never
played
the
game
before
and
she
cried
because
i
did
turn
up
and
so
i
the
first
think
of
it
if
you
please
absolutely
the
first
one
well
it
does
detract
from
the
interest
of
the
game
it
quite
a
different
game
and
requires
more
skill
but
not
more
than
i
have
perhaps
they
parted
with
another
tryst
set
for
the
next
morning
the
brother
artist
note
had
been
skilfully
kept
vibrating
betty
was
sure
that
she
should
never
have
any
feeling
for
him
but
mere
friendliness
she
was
glad
of
that
it
must
be
dreadful
to
be
really
in
love
so
unsettling
chapter
iii
voluntary
eustace
vernon
is
not
by
any
error
to
be
imagined
as
a
villain
of
the
deepest
dye
coldly
planning
to
bring
misery
to
a
simple
village
maiden
for
his
own
selfish
pleasure
not
at
all
as
he
himself
would
have
put
it
he
meant
no
harm
to
the
girl
he
was
a
master
of
two
arts
and
to
these
he
had
devoted
himself
wholly
one
was
the
art
of
painting
but
one
can
not
paint
for
all
the
hours
there
are
in
the
intervals
of
painting
vernon
always
sought
to
exercise
his
other
art
one
is
limited
of
course
by
the
possibilities
but
he
liked
to
have
always
at
least
one
love
affair
on
hand
and
just
now
there
were
none
none
at
least
possessing
the
one
charm
that
irresistibly
drew
him
newness
the
one
or
two
affairs
that
dragged
on
merely
meant
letter
writing
and
he
hated
writing
letters
almost
as
much
as
he
hated
reading
them
the
country
had
been
unfortunately
barren
of
interest
until
his
eyes
fell
on
that
sketching
figure
in
the
pink
dress
for
he
respected
one
of
his
arts
no
less
than
the
other
and
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
painting
a
vulgar
picture
as
of
undertaking
a
vulgar
he
was
no
pavement
artist
nor
did
he
degrade
his
art
by
caricatures
drawn
in
hotel
bars
dairy
maids
did
not
delight
him
and
the
mood
was
rare
with
him
in
which
one
finds
anything
to
say
to
a
little
milliner
he
wanted
the
means
not
the
end
and
was
at
one
with
the
unknown
sage
who
said
the
love
of
pleasure
spoils
the
pleasure
of
love
there
is
a
gift
less
rare
than
is
supposed
of
wiping
the
slate
clean
of
memories
and
beginning
all
over
again
a
certain
virginity
of
soul
that
makes
each
new
kiss
the
first
kiss
each
new
love
the
only
love
this
gift
was
vernon
and
he
had
cultivated
it
so
earnestly
so
delicately
that
except
in
certain
moods
when
he
lost
his
temper
and
with
it
his
control
of
his
impulses
he
was
able
to
bring
even
to
a
conservatory
flirtation
something
of
the
fresh
emotion
of
a
schoolboy
in
love
betty
awkwardnesses
which
he
took
for
advances
had
chilled
him
a
little
though
less
than
they
would
have
done
had
not
one
of
the
moods
been
on
him
he
had
dreaded
lest
the
affair
should
advance
too
quickly
his
own
taste
was
for
the
first
steps
in
an
affair
of
the
heart
the
delicate
doubts
the
planned
misunderstandings
he
did
not
question
his
own
ability
to
conduct
the
affair
capably
from
start
to
finish
but
he
hated
to
skip
the
dainty
preliminaries
he
had
feared
that
with
betty
he
should
have
to
skip
them
for
he
knew
that
it
is
only
in
their
first
love
affairs
that
women
have
the
patience
to
watch
the
flower
unfold
itself
he
himself
was
of
infinite
patience
in
that
pastime
he
bit
his
lip
and
struck
with
his
cane
at
the
buttercup
heads
he
had
made
a
wretched
beginning
with
his
good
and
sweet
his
young
and
innocent
and
beautiful
like
like
if
the
girl
had
been
a
shade
less
innocent
the
whole
business
would
have
been
muffed
muffed
hopelessly
he
would
be
there
early
a
ship
of
promise
should
be
not
launched
that
was
weeks
away
the
first
timbers
should
be
felled
to
build
a
ship
to
carry
him
and
her
too
of
course
a
little
way
towards
the
enchanted
islands
he
knew
the
sea
well
and
it
would
be
pleasant
to
steer
on
it
one
to
whom
it
was
all
new
all
all
dear
little
girl
he
said
i
do
suppose
she
has
ever
even
thought
of
love
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
but
he
meant
to
be
he
carefully
thought
of
her
all
that
day
of
her
hair
her
eyes
her
hands
her
hands
were
really
beautiful
small
dimpled
and
not
the
hands
he
loved
best
those
were
long
and
very
slender
but
still
beautiful
and
before
he
went
to
bed
he
wrote
a
little
poem
to
encourage
himself
yes
i
have
loved
before
i
know
this
longing
that
invades
my
days
this
shape
that
haunts
life
busy
ways
i
know
since
long
and
long
ago
this
starry
mystery
of
delight
that
floats
across
my
eager
eyes
this
pain
that
makes
earth
paradise
these
magic
songs
of
day
and
night
i
know
them
for
the
things
they
are
a
passing
pain
a
longing
fleet
a
shape
that
soon
i
shall
not
meet
a
fading
dream
of
veil
and
star
yet
even
as
my
lips
proclaim
the
wisdom
that
the
years
have
lent
your
absence
is
joy
banishment
and
life
one
music
is
your
name
i
love
you
to
the
heart
hid
core
those
other
loves
how
can
one
learn
from
marshlights
how
the
great
fires
burn
ah
no
i
never
loved
before
when
he
read
it
through
he
entitled
it
the
veil
of
maya
so
that
it
might
pretend
to
have
no
personal
application
after
that
more
than
ever
rankled
the
memory
of
that
first
morning
how
could
i
he
asked
himself
i
must
indeed
have
been
in
a
gross
mood
one
seems
sometimes
to
act
outside
oneself
altogether
temporary
possession
by
some
brutal
ancestor
perhaps
well
it
not
too
late
next
morning
he
worked
at
his
picture
in
the
but
his
head
found
itself
turning
towards
the
way
by
which
on
that
first
day
she
had
gone
she
must
know
that
on
a
day
like
this
he
would
not
be
wasting
the
light
that
he
would
be
working
she
would
be
wanting
to
see
him
again
would
she
come
out
he
wished
she
would
but
he
hoped
she
would
it
would
have
meant
another
readjustment
of
ideas
he
need
not
have
been
anxious
she
did
not
come
he
worked
steadily
masterfully
he
always
worked
best
at
the
beginning
of
a
love
affair
all
of
him
seemed
somehow
more
alive
more
awake
more
alert
and
competent
his
mood
was
growing
quickly
to
what
he
meant
it
to
be
he
was
what
actors
call
a
quick
study
soon
he
would
be
able
to
play
perfectly
without
so
much
as
a
thought
to
the
book
the
part
of
paul
to
this
child
virginia
had
virginia
he
wondered
any
relations
besides
the
whom
she
so
consented
to
hoodwink
relations
who
might
interfere
and
pray
and
meddle
and
spoil
things
however
ashamed
we
may
be
of
our
relations
they
can
not
forever
be
concealed
it
must
be
owned
that
betty
was
not
the
lonely
orphan
she
sometimes
pretended
to
herself
to
be
she
had
aunts
an
accident
that
may
happen
to
the
best
of
us
a
year
or
two
before
betty
was
born
a
certain
youth
of
good
birth
left
harrow
and
went
to
ealing
where
he
was
received
in
a
family
in
the
capacity
of
crammer
pup
the
family
was
the
crammer
and
his
daughter
a
young
woman
who
knew
exactly
what
she
wanted
and
who
meant
to
get
it
poverty
had
taught
her
to
know
what
she
wanted
nature
and
the
folly
of
youth
not
her
own
youth
taught
her
how
to
get
it
there
were
several
pups
she
selected
the
most
eligible
secretly
married
him
and
to
the
day
of
her
death
spoke
and
thought
of
the
marriage
as
a
he
was
a
dreamy
youth
who
wrote
verses
and
called
the
crammer
daughter
his
egeria
she
was
too
clever
not
to
be
kind
to
him
and
he
adored
her
and
believed
in
her
to
the
end
which
came
before
his
birthday
he
broke
his
neck
out
hunting
and
died
before
betty
was
born
his
people
exasperated
at
the
news
of
the
marriage
threatened
to
try
to
invalidate
it
on
the
score
of
the
false
swearing
that
had
been
needed
to
get
the
boy
of
nineteen
married
to
the
woman
of
egeria
was
frightened
she
compromised
for
an
annuity
of
two
hundred
pounds
to
be
continued
to
her
child
the
passion
of
this
woman
life
was
power
one
can
not
be
very
powerful
with
just
two
hundred
a
year
and
a
doubtful
position
as
the
widow
of
a
boy
whose
relations
are
prepared
to
dispute
one
marriage
desmond
spent
three
years
in
thought
and
in
caring
severely
for
the
wants
of
her
child
then
she
bought
four
handsome
dresses
and
some
impressive
bonnets
went
to
a
hydropathic
establishment
and
looked
about
her
of
the
eligible
men
there
cecil
underwood
seemed
on
enquiry
to
be
the
most
eligible
so
she
married
him
he
resisted
but
little
for
his
parish
needed
a
clergywoman
sadly
the
two
hundred
pounds
was
a
welcome
addition
to
an
income
depleted
by
the
purchase
of
rare
editions
and
at
the
moment
crippled
by
his
recent
acquisition
of
the
omiliac
of
vincentius
in
its
original
oak
boards
and
leather
strings
and
above
all
he
saw
in
the
betty
the
child
he
might
have
had
if
things
had
gone
otherwise
with
him
and
another
when
they
both
were
young
desmond
had
felt
certain
she
could
rule
a
parish
cecil
underwood
did
rule
it
as
she
had
known
she
could
she
ruled
her
husband
too
and
betty
when
she
caught
cold
from
working
all
day
among
damp
evergreens
for
the
christmas
decorations
and
developing
pneumonia
died
she
died
resentfully
thanking
god
that
she
had
always
done
her
duty
and
quite
unable
to
imagine
how
the
world
would
go
on
without
her
she
felt
almost
sure
that
in
cutting
short
her
career
of
usefulness
her
creator
was
guilty
of
an
error
of
judgment
which
he
would
sooner
or
later
find
reason
to
regret
her
husband
mourned
her
he
had
the
habit
of
her
of
her
strong
capable
ways
the
clockwork
precision
of
her
household
and
parish
arrangements
but
as
time
went
on
he
saw
that
perhaps
he
was
more
comfortable
without
her
as
a
reformed
drunkard
sees
that
it
is
better
not
to
rely
on
brandy
for
one
courage
he
saw
it
but
of
course
he
never
owned
it
to
himself
betty
was
quite
sincerely
she
forgot
all
the
mother
hard
tyrannies
her
cramping
rules
her
narrow
bitter
creed
and
remembered
only
the
calm
competence
amounting
to
genius
with
which
her
mother
had
ruled
the
village
world
her
unflagging
energy
and
patience
and
her
rare
moments
of
tenderness
she
remembered
too
all
her
own
lapses
from
filial
duty
and
those
memories
were
not
comfortable
yet
betty
too
when
the
remorseful
stage
had
worn
itself
out
found
life
fuller
freer
without
her
mother
her
she
hated
had
always
hated
but
he
could
be
avoided
she
went
to
a
at
torquay
and
some
of
her
holidays
were
spent
with
her
aunts
the
sisters
of
the
who
had
not
lived
to
see
betty
she
adored
the
aunts
they
lived
in
a
world
of
which
her
village
world
did
not
so
much
as
dream
they
spoke
of
things
which
folks
at
home
neither
knew
of
nor
cared
for
and
they
spoke
a
language
that
was
not
spoken
at
long
barton
of
course
everyone
who
was
anyone
at
long
barton
spoke
in
careful
and
correct
english
but
no
one
ever
troubled
to
turn
a
phrase
and
irony
would
have
been
considered
very
bad
form
indeed
aunt
nina
wore
lovely
clothes
and
powdered
her
still
pretty
face
aunt
julia
smoked
cigarettes
and
used
words
that
ladies
at
long
barton
did
not
use
betty
was
proud
of
them
both
it
was
aunt
nina
who
taught
betty
how
to
spend
her
allowance
how
to
buy
pretty
things
and
better
still
tried
to
teach
her
how
to
wear
them
aunt
julia
it
was
who
brought
her
the
indian
necklaces
and
promised
to
take
her
to
italy
some
day
if
she
was
good
aunt
nina
lived
in
grosvenor
square
and
aunt
julia
address
was
most
often
vaguely
the
continent
of
europe
sometimes
a
letter
addressed
to
some
odd
place
in
asia
or
america
would
find
her
but
when
betty
had
left
school
her
visits
to
aunt
nina
ceased
underwood
feared
that
she
was
now
of
an
age
to
be
influenced
by
trifles
and
that
london
society
would
make
her
frivolous
besides
he
had
missed
her
horribly
all
through
her
though
he
had
yielded
to
the
insistence
of
the
aunts
but
he
had
wanted
betty
badly
only
of
course
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
tell
her
so
so
betty
had
lived
on
at
the
rectory
carrying
on
with
more
or
less
of
success
such
of
her
mother
parish
workings
as
had
managed
to
outlive
their
author
and
writing
to
the
aunts
to
tell
them
how
bored
she
was
and
how
she
hated
to
be
called
lizzie
she
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
her
stepfather
had
known
as
lizzie
the
girl
who
if
fate
had
been
kind
would
have
been
his
wife
or
the
mother
of
his
child
betty
letters
breathed
contempt
of
parish
matters
weariness
of
the
dulness
of
the
country
and
exasperation
at
the
hardness
of
a
lot
where
nothing
ever
happened
well
something
had
happened
now
the
tremendous
nature
of
the
secret
she
was
keeping
against
the
world
almost
took
betty
breath
away
it
was
to
the
adventure
far
more
than
to
the
man
that
her
heart
beat
quickened
something
had
happened
long
barton
was
no
longer
the
dullest
place
in
the
world
it
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
see
her
diary
an
entry
following
a
gap
where
a
page
had
been
torn
out
is
very
kind
he
is
teaching
me
to
sketch
he
says
i
shall
do
very
well
when
i
have
forgotten
what
i
learned
at
school
it
is
so
nice
of
him
to
be
so
straightforward
i
hate
flattery
he
has
begun
my
portrait
it
is
beautiful
but
he
says
it
is
exactly
like
me
of
course
it
is
his
painting
that
makes
it
beautiful
and
not
anything
to
do
with
me
that
is
not
flattery
i
do
not
think
he
could
say
anything
unless
he
really
thought
it
he
is
that
sort
of
man
i
think
i
am
so
glad
he
is
so
good
if
he
were
a
different
sort
of
person
perhaps
it
would
not
be
quite
nice
for
me
to
go
and
meet
him
without
any
one
knowing
but
there
is
nothing
that
he
was
quite
different
the
first
day
but
i
think
then
he
was
off
his
guard
and
could
not
help
himself
i
do
know
quite
what
i
meant
by
that
but
anyway
i
am
sure
he
is
as
good
as
gold
and
that
is
such
a
comfort
i
revere
him
i
believe
he
is
really
noble
and
unselfish
and
so
few
men
are
alas
the
noble
and
unselfish
vernon
meanwhile
was
quite
happy
his
picture
was
going
splendidly
and
every
morning
he
woke
to
the
knowledge
that
his
image
filled
all
the
thoughts
of
a
good
little
girl
with
gray
dark
charming
eyes
and
a
face
that
reminded
one
of
a
pretty
kitten
her
drawing
was
not
half
bad
either
he
was
spared
the
mortifying
labour
of
trying
to
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
in
one
of
his
arts
as
in
the
other
he
decided
that
she
had
talent
and
it
was
pleasant
that
to
him
should
have
fallen
the
task
of
teacher
in
both
departments
those
who
hunt
the
fox
will
tell
you
that
reynard
enjoys
equally
with
the
hounds
and
their
masters
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
vernon
was
quite
of
this
opinion
in
regard
to
his
favourite
sport
he
really
felt
that
he
gave
as
much
pleasure
as
he
took
and
his
own
forgettings
were
so
easy
that
the
easy
forgetting
of
others
seemed
a
foregone
conclusion
his
forgetting
always
came
first
that
was
all
but
now
the
spring
her
charm
and
his
own
firm
working
together
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
never
forget
betty
could
never
wish
to
forget
her
her
pretty
conscious
dignity
charmed
him
he
stood
still
to
look
at
it
he
took
no
step
forward
his
role
was
that
of
the
deeply
respectful
brother
artist
if
his
hand
touched
hers
as
he
corrected
her
drawing
that
was
accident
if
as
he
leaned
over
her
criticising
her
work
the
wind
sent
the
end
of
her
hair
against
his
ear
that
could
hardly
be
avoided
in
a
breezy
english
spring
it
was
not
his
fault
that
the
little
thrill
it
gave
him
was
intensified
a
when
glancing
at
her
he
perceived
that
her
own
ears
had
grown
scarlet
betty
went
through
her
days
in
a
dream
there
were
all
the
duties
she
hated
the
mothers
meetings
the
parish
visits
when
she
tried
to
adjust
the
quarrels
and
calm
the
jealousies
of
the
stout
aggressive
mothers
the
carrying
round
the
parish
magazine
there
were
no
long
hours
now
in
every
spare
moment
she
worked
at
her
drawing
to
please
him
it
was
the
least
she
could
do
after
all
his
kindness
her
surprised
her
once
hard
at
work
with
charcoal
and
board
and
a
posing
for
her
with
a
broom
he
congratulated
himself
that
his
little
sermon
on
the
advantages
of
occupation
as
a
cure
for
discontent
had
borne
fruit
so
speedy
and
so
sound
dear
child
she
only
wanted
a
word
in
season
he
thought
and
he
said
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
have
put
away
vain
dreams
lizzie
and
your
labours
will
not
be
thrown
away
either
if
you
go
on
taking
pains
i
daresay
you
will
be
able
to
paint
some
nice
and
screens
for
the
school
bazaar
i
daresay
said
betty
adding
between
her
teeth
if
you
only
knew
but
we
must
keep
letitia
from
her
work
he
added
vaguely
conscientious
letitia
flounced
off
and
betty
his
back
turned
tore
up
the
drawing
and
as
a
beautiful
background
to
the
gross
realism
of
meetings
and
parish
tiresomenesses
was
always
the
atmosphere
of
the
golden
mornings
the
dew
and
the
stillness
the
gleam
of
his
white
coat
among
the
for
he
was
always
first
at
the
tryst
now
betty
was
drunk
and
she
was
too
young
to
distinguish
between
vintages
when
she
had
been
sober
she
had
feared
intoxication
now
she
was
drunk
she
thanked
heaven
that
she
was
sober

days
of
sunlight
and
clear
air
of
mornings
as
enchanting
as

of
dreams
as
full

as
may
mornings
then
an
interminable
sunday
hot
and
sultry
with

an
evening
of
thunder
and

a

its
own

and
a
monday
morning
gray
beyond
belief
with
a
soft
steady
rain
betty
stood
for
full
five
minutes
looking
out
at
the
straight
fine
fall
at
the
white
mist
spread
on
the
lawn
the
blue
mist
twined
round
the
trees
listening
to
the
plash
of
the
drops
that
gathered
and
fell
from
the
big
wet
ivy
leaves
to
the
guggle
of
the
the
hiss
of
smitten
gravel
he
never
go
she
thought
and
her
heart
sank
he
shaving
in
the
chill
damp
air
by
his
open
window
was
saying
she
be
there
of
course
women
are
all
perfectly
insensible
to
weather
two
mackintoshed
figures
met
in
the
circle
of
pines
you
have
come
he
said
i
never
dreamed
you
would
how
cold
your
hand
is
he
held
it
for
a
moment
warmly
clasped
i
thought
it
might
stop
any
minute
said
betty
it
seemed
a
pity
to
waste
a
morning
yes
he
said
musingly
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waste
a
morning
i
would
not
waste
one
of
these
mornings
for
a
kingdom
betty
fumbled
with
her
sketching
things
as
a
sort
of
guarantee
of
good
faith
but
it
too
wet
to
work
said
she
i
suppose
i
better
go
home
again
that
seems
a
dull
idea
for
me
he
said
it
very
selfish
of
course
but
i
rather
sad
this
morning
wo
you
stay
a
little
and
cheer
me
up
betty
asked
nothing
better
but
even
to
her
a
in
a
wood
with
rain
pattering
and
splashing
on
leaves
and
path
and
resonant
mackintoshes
seemed
to
demand
some
excuse
i
should
think
breakfast
and
being
dry
would
cheer
you
up
better
than
anything
said
she
and
it
very
wet
here
hang
breakfast
but
you
right
about
the
wetness
there
a
shed
in
the
field
yonder
a
harrow
and
a
plough
live
there
they
sure
to
be
at
home
on
a
day
like
this
let
go
and
ask
for
their
hospitality
i
hope
they
be
nice
to
us
laughed
betty
it
dreadful
to
go
where
you
not
wanted
how
do
you
know
he
asked
laughing
too
come
give
me
your
hand
and
let
run
for
it
they
ran
hand
in
hand
the
wet
mackintoshes
flapping
and
slapping
about
their
knees
and
drew
up
laughing
and
breathless
in
the
dry
quiet
of
the
shed
vernon
thought
of
love
and
lewisham
but
it
was
not
the
moment
to
say
so
see
they
are
quite
pleased
to
see
us
said
he
they
do
say
a
word
against
our
sheltering
here
the
plough
looks
a
bit
glum
but
she
grow
to
like
us
presently
as
for
harrow
look
how
he
smiling
welcome
at
you
with
all
his
teeth
i
glad
he
ca
come
forward
to
welcome
us
said
betty
his
teeth
look
very
fierce
he
could
of
course
only
he
enchanted
he
used
to
be
able
to
move
about
but
now
he
condemned
to
sit
still
and
only
smile
till
till
he
sees
two
perfectly
happy
people
are
you
perfectly
happy
he
asked
anxiously
i
do
know
said
betty
truly
are
you
no
not
quite
perfectly
i
so
glad
said
betty
i
should
like
the
harrow
to
begin
to
move
while
we
here
i
sure
it
would
bite
us
he
sighed
and
looked
grave
so
you
do
want
me
to
be
perfectly
happy
she
looked
at
him
with
her
head
on
one
side
not
here
she
said
i
ca
trust
that
harrow
his
eyelids
narrowed
over
his
eyes
then
relaxed
no
she
was
merely
playing
at
enchanted
harrows
are
you
cold
still
he
asked
and
reached
for
her
hand
she
gave
it
frankly
not
a
bit
she
said
and
took
it
away
again
the
run
warmed
me
in
fact
she
unbuttoned
the
mackintosh
and
spread
it
on
the
bar
of
the
plough
and
sat
down
her
white
dress
lighted
up
the
shadows
of
the
shed
outside
the
rain
fell
steadily
may
i
sit
down
too
can
plough
find
room
for
two
children
on
her
lap
she
drew
aside
the
folds
of
her
dress
but
even
then
only
a
little
space
was
left
the
plough
had
been
carelessly
housed
and
nearly
half
of
it
was
where
the
rain
drove
in
on
it
so
that
they
were
very
close
together
so
close
that
he
had
to
throw
his
head
back
to
see
clearly
how
the
rain
had
made
the
short
hair
curl
round
her
forehead
and
ears
and
how
fresh
were
the
tints
of
face
and
lips
also
he
had
to
support
himself
by
an
arm
stretched
out
behind
her
his
arm
was
not
round
her
but
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
as
far
as
the
look
of
the
thing
went
he
thought
of
the
arm
of
lewisham
did
you
ever
have
your
fortune
told
he
asked
no
never
i
always
wanted
to
but
father
hates
gipsies
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
used
to
put
on
my
best
clothes
and
go
out
into
the
lanes
and
sit
about
and
hope
the
gipsies
would
steal
me
but
they
never
did
they
a
degenerate
race
blind
to
their
own
interests
but
they
have
a
monopoly
of
chances
fortunately
his
eyes
were
on
her
face
i
never
had
my
fortune
told
said
betty
i
love
it
but
i
think
i
should
be
afraid
all
the
same
something
might
come
true
vernon
was
more
surprised
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
at
the
sudden
involuntary
movement
in
his
right
arm
it
cost
him
a
conscious
effort
not
to
let
the
arm
follow
its
inclination
and
fall
across
her
slender
shoulders
while
he
should
say
your
fortune
is
that
i
love
you
is
it
good
or
bad
fortune
he
braced
the
muscles
of
his
arm
and
kept
it
where
it
was
that
sudden
unreasonable
impulse
was
a
mortification
an
insult
to
the
man
whose
pride
it
was
to
believe
that
his
impulses
were
always
planned
i
can
tell
fortunes
he
said
when
i
was
a
boy
i
spent
a
couple
of
months
with
some
gipsies
they
taught
me
lots
of
things
his
memory
excellently
trained
did
not
allow
itself
to
dwell
for
an
instant
on
his
reason
for
following
those
gipsies
on
the
girl
with
the
skin
like
pale
amber
who
had
taught
him
by
the
flicker
of
the
the
lines
of
head
and
heart
and
life
and
other
things
beside
oh
but
many
other
things
that
was
before
he
became
an
artist
he
was
only
an
amateur
in
those
days
did
they
teach
you
how
to
tell
fortunes
really
and
truly
asked
betty
we
had
a
tent
at
the
school
bazaar
last
year
and
the
youngest
smithson
girl
dressed
up
in
spangles
and
a
red
dress
and
said
she
was
zara
the
eastern
mystic
and
foreteller
of
the
future
but
she
got
it
all
out
of
napoleon
book
of
fate
i
do
get
my
out
of
anybody
book
of
anything
he
said
i
get
it
out
of
people
hands
and
their
faces
some
faces
are
their
fortunes
you
know
i
know
they
are
she
said
a
little
sadly
but
everybody
got
a
hand
and
a
fortune
whether
they
got
that
sort
of
or
not
but
the
fortunes
of
the
people
are
the
ones
one
likes
best
to
tell
of
course
she
admitted
wistfully
but
what
going
to
happen
to
you
is
just
as
interesting
to
even
if
your
face
interesting
to
anybody
do
you
always
tell
fortunes
quite
truly
i
mean
do
you
follow
the
real
rules
or
do
you
make
up
pretty
fortunes
for
the
people
with
the
pretty
there
no
need
to
up
the
pretty
fortunes
are
always
there
for
the
pretty
unless
of
course
the
hand
contradicts
the
face
but
can
it
ca
it
there
may
be
a
face
that
all
the
beautiful
things
in
the
world
are
promised
to
just
by
being
so
beautiful
itself
it
draws
beautiful
happenings
to
it
but
if
the
hand
contradicts
the
face
if
the
hand
is
one
of
those
narrow
niggardly
distrustful
hands
one
of
the
hands
that
will
give
nothing
and
take
nothing
a
hand
without
courage
without
generosity
well
then
one
might
as
well
be
born
without
a
for
any
good
it
will
ever
do
one
then
you
do
care
to
tell
fortunes
for
people
who
have
fortune
faces
i
should
like
to
tell
yours
if
you
would
let
me
shall
i
he
held
out
his
hand
but
her
hand
was
withheld
i
ought
to
cross
your
hand
with
silver
ought
i
she
asked
it
considered
correct
but
oh
do
let
neglect
any
proper
precaution
she
said
i
got
any
money
tell
it
me
and
i
will
bring
a
sixpence
you
could
cross
my
hand
with
your
watch
he
said
and
i
could
take
the
crossing
as
an
of
the
sixpence
she
detached
the
old
watch
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
gravely
traced
a
cross
on
it
now
he
said
all
preliminary
formalities
being
complied
with
let
the
prophet
do
his
work
give
me
your
hand
pretty
lady
and
the
old
gipsy
will
tell
you
your
fortune
true
he
held
the
hand
in
his
bending
back
the
pink
with
his
thumb
and
looked
earnestly
at
its
lines
then
he
looked
in
her
face
longer
than
he
had
ever
permitted
himself
to
look
he
looked
till
her
eyes
fell
it
was
a
charming
picture
he
was
tall
strong
and
quite
as
as
a
clever
man
has
any
need
to
be
and
she
was
as
pretty
as
any
oleograph
of
them
all
it
seemed
a
thousand
pities
that
there
should
be
no
witness
to
such
a
tableau
no
audience
to
such
a
charming
scene
the
pity
of
it
struck
destiny
and
destiny
flashed
the
white
of
betty
dress
a
shrill
point
of
light
into
an
eye
a
hundred
yards
away
the
owner
with
true
rustic
finesse
drew
back
into
the
wood
shadow
shaded
one
eye
with
a
brown
rustic
hand
looked
again
and
began
a
detour
which
landed
the
rustic
boots
all
silently
behind
the
shed
at
a
spot
where
a
served
as
frame
for
the
little
picture
the
rustic
eye
was
fitted
to
the
while
vernon
holding
betty
hand
gazed
in
betty
face
and
decided
that
this
was
no
time
to
analyse
his
sensations
neither
heard
the
furtive
rustic
tread
or
noted
the
gleam
of
the
pale
rustic
eye
the
labourer
shook
his
head
as
he
hurried
quickly
away
he
had
daughters
of
his
own
and
the
rector
had
been
kind
when
one
of
those
daughters
had
suddenly
come
home
from
service
ill
and
with
no
prospect
of
another
place
of
hands
and
of
sheep
eyes
said
he
we
knows
what
that
the
beginnings
of
well
well
youth
the
season
for
silliness
but
there
bounds
there
bounds
and
all
of
a
mornin
so
early
too
lord
above
knows
what
it
would
be
like
of
a
evenin
he
shook
his
head
again
and
made
haste
vernon
had
forced
his
eyes
to
leave
the
face
of
betty
your
fortune
he
was
saying
is
curiously
enough
just
one
of
those
fortunes
i
was
speaking
of
you
will
have
great
chances
of
happiness
if
you
have
the
courage
to
take
them
you
will
cross
the
sea
you
never
travelled
have
you
no
never
further
than
torquay
i
was
at
school
there
you
know
and
london
of
course
but
i
should
love
it
is
it
horrid
to
think
that
one
might
grow
quite
old
and
never
have
been
anywhere
or
done
anything
that
depends
on
oneself
does
it
adventures
are
to
the
adventurous
yes
that
all
very
well
girls
ca
be
adventurous
yes
it
the
prince
who
sets
out
to
seek
his
fortune
is
it
the
princess
has
to
sit
at
home
and
wait
for
hers
to
come
to
her
it
generally
does
if
she
a
real
princess
but
half
the
fun
must
be
the
seeking
for
it
said
betty
you
right
said
he
it
is
the
labourer
had
reached
the
his
pace
had
quickened
to
the
quickening
remembrance
of
his
own
daughter
sitting
at
home
silent
and
sullen
do
you
really
see
it
in
my
hand
asked
betty
about
my
crossing
the
sea
i
mean
it
there
but
it
depends
on
yourself
like
everything
else
i
did
ask
my
to
let
me
go
she
said
after
that
first
day
you
know
when
you
said
i
ought
to
study
in
paris
and
he
would
of
course
no
he
said
paris
was
a
wicked
place
it
is
really
is
it
every
place
is
wicked
said
he
and
every
place
is
good
it
all
as
one
takes
things
the
rectory
gate
clicked
sharply
as
it
swung
to
behind
the
labourer
the
rectory
gravel
scrunched
beneath
the
labourer
boots
yes
the
master
was
up
he
could
be
seen
the
heavy
boots
were
being
rubbed
against
the
birch
broom
that
rooted
at
kentish
back
doors
stands
to
receive
on
its
purple
twigs
the
scrapings
of
kentish
clay
from
rustic
feet
you
have
the
artistic
lines
very
strongly
marked
vernon
was
saying
one
two
three
yes
painting
music
perhaps
i
am
very
fond
of
music
said
betty
thinking
of
the
hour
daily
struggle
with
the
mikado
and
the
moonlight
sonata
but
three
arts
what
could
the
third
one
be
her
thoughts
played
for
an
instant
with
triumphs
achieved
behind
footlights
rapturous
applause
showers
of
bouquets
whatever
it
is
you
enormous
talent
for
it
he
said
you
find
out
what
it
is
in
good
time
perhaps
it
be
something
much
more
important
than
the
other
two
put
together
and
perhaps
you
got
even
more
talent
for
it
than
you
have
for
others
but
there
is
any
other
talent
that
i
can
think
of
i
can
think
of
a
few
there
the
stage
but
it
not
that
i
fancy
or
not
exactly
that
there
literature
confess
now
do
you
write
poetry
sometimes
when
you
all
alone
at
night
then
there
the
art
of
being
amusing
and
the
art
of
being
of
being
liked
shall
i
be
successful
in
any
of
the
arts
in
one
certainly
ah
said
betty
if
i
could
only
go
to
paris
it
not
always
necessary
to
go
to
paris
for
success
in
one
art
he
said
but
i
want
to
go
i
sure
i
could
do
better
there
are
you
satisfied
with
your
present
master
oh
it
was
a
cry
of
genuine
distress
of
heartfelt
disclaim
you
i
did
mean
that
but
you
wo
always
be
here
and
when
you
gone
why
then
again
he
had
to
control
the
involuntary
movement
of
his
left
arm
but
i
not
going
for
months
yet
do
let
us
cross
a
bridge
till
we
come
to
it
your
promises
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
and
your
he
turned
her
hand
more
fully
to
the
light
in
the
rector
study
the
labourer
was
speaking
standing
shufflingly
on
the
margin
of
the
turkey
carpet
the
rector
listened
his
hand
on
an
open
folio
where
fat
infants
peered
through
the
ornamental
initials
and
so
i
come
straight
up
to
you
sir
me
being
a
father
and
you
the
same
sir
for
all
the
difference
betwixt
our
ways
in
life
says
i
to
myself
says
i
and
bitter
hard
i
feels
it
too
i
says
says
i
got
a
daughter
as
begun
that
way
not
a
doubt
of
it
holdin
of
hands
and
sittin
close
alongside
and
you
know
come
to
her
the
rector
shivered
at
the
implication
then
i
says
says
i
as
not
the
rector
wo
thank
you
for
interferin
least
said
soonest
mended
says
i
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
the
rector
difficultly
and
his
hand
shook
on
ambrosius
yellow
page
you
see
sir
the
man
tone
held
all
that
deferent
apology
that
truth
telling
demands
gells
is
gells
be
they
never
so
up
in
the
world
all
the
world
over
bless
their
hearts
and
young
men
is
young
men
d
n
them
asking
your
pardon
sir
i
sure
but
the
word
slipped
out
and
i
should
ha
been
easy
if
anything
had
have
gone
wrong
with
miss
god
bless
her
all
along
of
the
want
of
a
word
in
season
asking
your
pardon
sir
but
even
young
ladies
is
flesh
and
blood
when
it
comes
to
the
point
ai
they
now
he
ended
appealingly
the
rector
spoke
with
an
obvious
effort
got
his
hand
off
the
page
and
closed
the
folio
you
done
quite
right
george
he
said
and
i
greatly
obliged
to
you
only
i
do
ask
you
to
keep
this
to
yourself
you
would
have
liked
it
if
people
had
heard
a
thing
like
that
about
your
ruby
before
i
mean
when
she
was
at
home
he
replaced
the
two
folios
on
the
shelf
not
me
sir
george
answered
i
mum
i
do
assure
you
sir
and
if
i
might
make
so
bold
you
just
pop
on
your
hat
and
step
acrost
directly
minute
there
that
little
hole
back
of
the
shed
what
i
told
you
of
you
ai
only
got
to
pop
your
reverend
eye
to
that
there
and
you
see
for
yourself
as
i
ai
give
tongue
for
no
dragged
scent
thank
you
george
said
the
rector
i
will
good
morning
god
bless
you
the
formula
came
glibly
but
it
was
from
the
lips
only
that
it
came
lizzie
his
white
innocent
in
a
shed
a
man
a
stranger
holding
her
hand
his
arm
around
her
his
eyes
his
lips
perhaps
daring
the
rector
was
half
way
down
his
garden
drive
your
vernon
was
saying
it
a
little
difficult
you
will
be
deeply
beloved
to
have
one
fortune
told
is
disquieting
to
keep
silence
during
the
telling
deepens
the
disquiet
curiously
it
seemed
good
to
betty
to
laugh
soldier
sailor
tinker
tailor
she
said
which
am
i
going
to
marry
kind
gipsy
i
do
believe
the
gipsies
who
say
they
can
see
marriage
in
a
hand
he
answered
gravely
and
betty
feared
he
had
thought
her
flippant
or
even
vulgar
what
one
sees
are
not
the
shadows
of
coming
conventions
one
sees
the
great
emotional
events
the
things
that
change
and
mould
and
develop
character
yes
you
will
be
greatly
beloved
and
you
will
love
deeply
i
not
to
be
happy
in
my
affairs
of
the
heart
then
still
a
careful
flippancy
seemed
best
to
betty
did
i
say
so
do
you
really
think
that
there
are
no
happy
love
affairs
but
those
that
end
in
a
wedding
breakfast
and
bridesmaids
with
a
bazaar
show
of
hideous
silver
and
still
more
hideous
crockery
and
all
one
relations
assembled
to
dissect
one
most
sacred
secrets
betty
had
thought
so
but
it
seemed
coarse
to
own
it
ca
you
imagine
he
went
on
dreamily
a
love
affair
so
perfect
that
it
could
not
but
lose
its
finest
fragrance
if
the
world
were
called
to
watch
the
plucking
of
love
flower
ca
you
imagine
a
love
so
great
so
deep
so
tender
so
absolutely
possessing
the
whole
life
of
the
lover
that
he
would
almost
grudge
any
manifestation
of
it
because
such
a
manifestation
must
necessarily
be
a
repetition
of
some
of
the
ways
in
which
unworthy
loves
have
been
manifested
by
less
happy
lovers
i
can
seem
to
see
that
one
might
love
the
one
love
of
a
and
be
content
to
hold
the
treasure
in
one
heart
a
treasure
such
as
no
other
man
ever
had
and
grudge
even
a
word
or
a
look
that
might
make
it
less
the
single
perfect
rose
of
the
world
oh
dear
said
betty
to
herself
but
i
talking
like
a
book
he
said
and
laughed
i
always
get
dreamy
and
absurd
when
i
tell
fortunes
anyway
as
i
said
before
you
will
be
greatly
beloved
indeed
unless
your
hand
is
very
untruthful
which
i
sure
it
never
could
be
you
are
beloved
now
far
more
than
you
can
possibly
guess
betty
caught
at
her
flippancy
but
it
evaded
her
and
all
she
found
to
say
was
oh
and
her
eyes
fell
there
was
a
silence
vernon
still
held
her
hand
but
he
was
no
longer
looking
at
it
a
black
figure
darkened
the
daylight
the
two
on
the
plough
started
up
started
apart
nothing
more
was
wanted
to
convince
the
rector
of
all
that
he
least
wished
to
believe
go
home
lizzie
he
said
go
to
your
room
and
to
her
his
face
looked
the
face
of
a
fiend
it
is
hard
to
control
the
muscles
under
a
sudden
emotion
compounded
of
sorrow
sympathy
and
an
immeasurable
pity
go
to
your
room
and
stay
there
till
i
send
for
you
betty
went
like
a
beaten
dog
the
rector
turned
to
the
young
man
now
sir
he
said
chapter
the
prisoner
when
vernon
looked
back
on
that
interview
he
was
honestly
pleased
with
himself
he
had
been
patient
he
had
been
kind
even
in
the
end
he
had
been
positively
chivalrous
he
had
hardly
allowed
himself
to
be
ruffled
for
an
instant
but
had
met
the
bitter
flow
of
biblical
language
with
perfect
courtesy
he
regretted
of
course
deeply
this
unfortunate
misunderstanding
accident
had
made
him
acquainted
with
miss
desmond
talent
he
had
merely
offered
her
a
little
of
that
help
which
between
brother
artists
the
phrase
had
not
for
the
rector
the
charm
it
had
had
for
betty
the
rector
spoke
again
and
vernon
listened
in
deepest
deference
no
he
had
not
been
holding
miss
desmond
hand
he
had
merely
been
telling
her
fortune
no
one
could
regret
more
profoundly
than
he
and
so
on
he
was
much
wounded
by
underwood
unworthy
suspicions
the
rector
ran
through
a
few
texts
his
pulpit
denunciations
of
iniquity
though
always
earnest
had
lacked
this
eloquence
vernon
listened
quietly
i
can
only
express
my
regret
that
my
thoughtlessness
should
have
annoyed
you
and
beg
you
not
to
blame
miss
desmond
it
was
perhaps
a
little
unconventional
but
unconventional
to
try
to
ruin
vernon
held
up
his
hand
he
was
genuinely
shocked
forgive
me
he
said
but
i
ca
hear
such
words
in
connection
with
with
a
lady
for
whom
i
have
the
deepest
respect
you
are
heated
now
sir
and
i
can
make
every
allowance
for
your
natural
vexation
but
i
must
ask
you
not
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
decency
the
rector
bit
his
lip
and
vernon
went
on
i
have
listened
to
your
abuse
yes
your
abuse
without
defending
myself
but
i
ca
allow
anyone
even
her
father
to
say
a
word
against
her
i
am
not
her
father
said
the
old
man
bitterly
and
on
the
instant
vernon
understood
him
as
betty
had
never
done
the
young
man
tone
changed
instantly
look
here
he
said
and
his
face
grew
almost
boyish
i
am
really
most
awfully
sorry
the
whole
thing
what
there
is
of
it
and
very
little
was
entirely
my
doing
it
was
inexcusably
thoughtless
miss
desmond
is
very
young
and
very
innocent
it
is
i
who
ought
to
have
known
better
and
perhaps
i
did
but
the
country
is
very
dull
and
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
teach
so
apt
a
pupil
he
spoke
eagerly
and
the
ring
of
truth
was
in
his
voice
but
the
rector
felt
that
he
was
listening
to
the
excuses
of
a
serpent
then
you
have
me
believe
that
you
do
even
love
her
no
more
than
she
does
me
said
vernon
very
truly
i
never
breathed
a
word
of
love
to
her
he
went
on
such
an
idea
never
entered
our
heads
she
a
charming
girl
and
i
admire
her
immensely
but
he
sought
hastily
for
a
weapon
and
defended
betty
with
the
first
that
came
to
hand
i
am
already
engaged
to
another
lady
it
is
entirely
as
an
artist
that
i
am
interested
in
miss
betty
serpent
said
the
rector
within
himself
lying
serpent
vernon
was
addressing
himself
silently
in
terms
not
more
flattering
fool
idiot
brute
to
let
the
child
in
for
this
for
it
going
to
be
a
hell
of
a
time
for
her
anyhow
and
as
for
me
well
the
game
is
up
absolutely
up
i
am
really
most
awfully
sorry
he
said
again
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
your
repentance
said
the
rector
frowning
my
regret
you
may
believe
in
said
vernon
stiffly
there
is
no
ground
for
even
the
mention
of
such
a
word
as
repentance
if
your
repentance
is
sincere
he
underlined
the
word
you
will
leave
long
barton
leave
without
a
word
a
sign
from
betty
a
word
or
a
sign
to
her
it
might
be
best
if
i
will
go
sir
if
you
will
let
me
have
your
assurance
that
you
will
say
nothing
to
miss
desmond
that
you
wo
make
her
unhappy
that
you
let
the
whole
matter
drop
i
will
make
no
bargains
with
you
cried
the
rector
do
your
worst
thank
god
i
can
defend
her
from
you
she
needs
no
defence
it
not
i
who
am
lacking
in
respect
and
consideration
for
her
said
vernon
a
little
hotly
but
as
i
say
i
go
if
you
just
promise
to
be
gentle
with
her
i
do
not
need
to
be
taught
my
duty
by
a
villain
sir
the
old
clergyman
was
trembling
with
rage
i
wish
to
god
i
were
a
younger
man
that
i
might
chastise
you
for
the
hound
you
are
his
upraised
cane
shook
in
his
hand
words
are
thrown
away
on
you
i
sorry
i
ca
use
the
only
arguments
that
can
come
home
to
a
puppy
if
you
were
a
younger
man
said
vernon
slowly
your
words
would
not
have
been
thrown
away
on
me
they
would
have
had
the
answer
they
deserved
i
shall
not
leave
long
barton
and
i
shall
see
miss
desmond
when
and
how
i
choose
long
barton
shall
know
you
in
your
true
character
sir
i
promise
you
so
you
would
blacken
her
to
blacken
me
one
sees
how
it
is
that
she
does
not
love
her
father
he
meant
to
be
cruel
but
it
was
not
till
he
saw
the
green
shadows
round
the
old
man
lips
that
he
knew
just
how
cruel
he
had
been
the
quivering
old
mouth
opened
and
closed
and
opened
the
cold
eyes
gleamed
and
the
trembling
hand
in
one
nervous
movement
raised
the
cane
and
struck
the
other
man
sharply
across
the
face
it
was
a
hysterical
blow
like
a
woman
and
with
it
the
tears
sprang
to
the
faded
eyes
then
it
was
that
vernon
behaved
well
when
he
thought
of
it
afterwards
he
decided
that
he
had
behaved
astonishingly
well
with
the
smart
of
that
cut
stinging
on
his
flesh
the
mark
of
it
rising
red
and
angry
across
his
cheek
he
stepped
back
a
pace
and
without
a
word
without
a
retaliatory
movement
without
even
a
change
of
facial
expression
he
executed
the
most
elaborately
courteous
bow
as
of
one
treading
a
minuet
recovered
the
upright
and
walked
away
bareheaded
the
old
clergyman
was
left
planted
there
the
cane
still
jigging
up
and
down
in
his
shaking
hand
a
little
theatrical
perhaps
mused
vernon
when
the
cover
of
the
wood
gave
him
leave
to
lay
his
fingers
to
his
throbbing
cheek
but
nothing
could
have
annoyed
the
old
chap
more
however
effective
it
may
be
to
turn
the
other
cheek
the
turning
of
it
does
not
cool
one
passions
and
he
walked
through
the
wood
angrier
than
he
ever
remembered
being
but
the
cool
rain
dripping
from
the
hazel
and
sweet
chestnut
leaves
fell
pleasantly
on
his
uncovered
head
and
flushed
face
before
he
was
through
the
wood
he
was
able
to
laugh
and
the
laugh
was
a
real
laugh
if
rather
a
rueful
one
vernon
could
never
keep
angry
very
long
poor
old
devil
he
said
he
have
to
put
a
special
clause
in
the
general
confession
next
sunday
poor
old
devil
and
poor
little
betty
and
poorest
me
because
however
we
look
at
it
and
however
we
may
have
damn
well
bluffed
over
it
the
game
up
absolutely
up
when
one
has
a
definite
end
in
view
marriage
let
us
say
or
an
elopement
secret
correspondences
the
surmounting
of
garden
walls
the
bribery
of
servants
are
in
the
picture
but
in
a
small
sweet
idyll
with
no
backbone
of
intention
to
it
these
things
are
inartistic
and
vernon
was
above
and
before
all
an
artist
he
must
go
away
and
he
knew
it
and
his
picture
was
not
finished
could
he
possibly
leave
that
incomplete
the
thought
pricked
sharply
he
had
not
made
much
progress
with
the
picture
in
these
last
days
it
had
been
pleasanter
to
work
at
the
portrait
of
betty
if
he
moved
to
the
next
village
yes
that
must
be
thought
over
he
spent
the
day
thinking
of
that
and
of
other
things
the
reverend
cecil
underwood
stood
where
he
was
left
till
the
man
he
had
struck
had
passed
out
of
sight
then
the
cane
slipped
through
his
hand
and
fell
rattling
to
the
ground
he
looked
down
at
it
curiously
then
he
reached
out
both
hands
vaguely
and
touched
the
shaft
of
the
plough
he
felt
his
way
along
it
and
sat
down
where
they
had
sat
staring
dully
before
him
at
the
shadows
in
the
shed
and
at
the
steady
fall
of
the
rain
outside
betty
mackintosh
was
lying
on
the
floor
he
picked
it
up
presently
and
smoothed
out
the
creases
then
he
watched
the
rain
again
an
hour
had
passed
before
he
got
stiffly
up
and
went
home
with
her
cloak
on
his
arm
yes
miss
lizzie
was
in
her
room
had
a
headache
he
sent
up
her
breakfast
arranging
the
food
himself
and
calling
back
the
maid
because
the
tray
lacked
marmalade
then
he
poured
out
his
own
tea
and
sat
stirring
it
till
it
was
cold
she
was
in
her
room
waiting
for
him
to
send
for
her
he
must
send
for
her
he
must
speak
to
her
but
what
could
he
say
what
was
there
to
say
that
would
not
be
a
cruelty
what
was
there
to
ask
that
would
not
be
a
challenge
to
her
to
lie
as
the
serpent
had
lied
i
am
glad
i
struck
him
the
reverend
cecil
told
himself
again
and
again
brought
it
home
to
him
he
was
quite
cowed
he
could
do
nothing
but
bow
and
cringe
away
yes
i
am
glad
but
the
girl
the
serpent
had
asked
him
to
be
gentle
with
her
had
dared
to
ask
him
he
could
think
of
no
way
gentle
enough
for
dealing
with
this
crisis
the
habit
of
prayer
caught
him
he
prayed
for
guidance
then
quite
suddenly
he
saw
what
to
do
that
will
be
best
he
said
she
will
feel
that
less
he
rang
and
ordered
the
fly
from
the
peal
of
bells
went
to
his
room
to
change
his
old
coat
for
a
better
one
since
appearances
must
be
kept
up
even
if
the
heart
be
breaking
his
thin
hair
was
disordered
and
his
tie
he
noticed
was
oddly
crumpled
as
though
strange
hands
had
been
busy
with
his
throat
he
put
on
a
fresh
tie
smoothed
his
hair
and
went
down
again
as
he
passed
he
lingered
a
moment
outside
her
door
betty
watching
with
red
eyes
and
swollen
lips
saw
him
enter
the
fly
saw
him
give
an
order
heard
the
door
bang
the
old
coachman
clambered
clumsily
to
his
place
and
the
carriage
lumbered
down
the
drive
oh
how
cruel
he
is
he
might
have
spoken
to
me
i
suppose
going
to
keep
me
waiting
for
days
as
a
penance
and
i
have
really
done
anything
wrong
it
a
shame
i
a
good
mind
to
run
away
running
away
required
consideration
in
the
meantime
since
he
was
out
of
the
house
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
go
downstairs
she
was
not
a
child
to
be
kept
to
her
room
in
disgrace
she
bathed
her
distorted
face
powdered
it
and
tried
to
think
that
the
servants
should
they
see
her
would
notice
nothing
where
had
he
gone
for
no
goal
within
his
parish
would
a
hired
carriage
be
needed
he
had
gone
to
sevenoaks
or
to
the
station
perhaps
he
had
gone
to
westerham
there
was
a
convent
there
a
protestant
sisterhood
perhaps
he
was
going
to
make
arrangements
for
shutting
her
up
there
never
betty
would
die
first
at
least
she
would
run
away
first
but
where
could
one
run
to
the
aunts
betty
loved
the
aunts
but
she
distrusted
their
age
they
were
too
old
to
sympathise
really
with
her
they
would
most
likely
understand
as
little
as
her
had
done
an
inward
monitor
told
betty
that
the
story
of
the
of
the
seven
stolen
meetings
with
no
in
them
would
sound
very
unconvincing
to
any
ears
but
those
of
the
one
person
already
convinced
but
she
would
not
be
shut
up
in
a
convent
no
not
by
fifty
aunts
and
a
hundred
she
would
go
to
him
he
would
understand
he
was
the
only
person
who
ever
had
understood
she
would
go
straight
to
him
and
ask
him
what
to
do
he
would
advise
her
he
was
so
clever
so
good
so
noble
whatever
he
advised
would
be
trembling
and
in
a
cold
white
rage
of
determination
betty
fastened
on
her
hat
found
her
gloves
and
purse
the
mackintosh
she
remembered
had
been
left
in
the
shed
she
pictured
her
trampling
fiercely
upon
it
as
he
told
vernon
what
he
thought
of
him
she
took
her
golf
cape
at
the
last
moment
she
hesitated
vernon
would
not
be
idle
what
would
he
be
doing
suppose
he
should
send
a
note
suppose
he
had
watched
underwood
drive
away
and
should
come
boldly
up
and
ask
for
her
was
it
wise
to
leave
the
house
but
perhaps
he
would
be
hanging
about
the
church
yard
or
watching
from
the
park
for
a
glimpse
of
her
she
would
at
least
go
out
and
see
i
leave
a
farewell
letter
she
said
in
case
i
never
come
back
she
found
her
little
envelopes
but
no
paper
of
course
one
ca
with
dignity
write
cutting
farewells
on
envelopes
she
tore
a
page
from
her
diary
you
have
driven
me
to
this
she
wrote
i
am
going
away
and
in
time
i
shall
try
to
forgive
you
all
the
petty
meannesses
and
cruelties
of
all
these
years
i
know
you
always
hated
me
but
you
might
have
had
some
pity
all
my
life
i
shall
bear
the
marks
on
my
soul
of
the
bitter
tyranny
i
have
endured
here
now
i
am
going
away
out
into
the
world
and
god
knows
what
will
become
of
me
she
folded
enveloped
and
addressed
the
note
stuck
a
long
fiercely
through
it
and
left
it
patent
speared
to
her
with
her
name
uppermost
little
room
she
said
i
feel
i
shall
never
see
you
again
slowly
and
sadly
she
crossed
the
room
and
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
the
door
was
locked
once
years
ago
a
happier
man
than
the
reverend
cecil
had
been
rector
of
long
barton
and
in
the
room
that
now
was
betty
he
had
had
iron
bars
fixed
to
the
two
windows
because
that
room
was
the
nursery
that
evening
after
dinner
vernon
sat
at
his
parlour
window
looking
idly
along
the
wet
to
the
belt
of
lilacs
and
the
pale
gleams
of
watery
sunset
behind
them
he
had
passed
a
disquieting
day
he
hated
to
leave
things
unfinished
and
now
the
idyll
was
ruined
and
the
picture
threatened
and
betty
portrait
was
not
finished
and
never
would
be
come
in
he
said
and
his
landlady
heavily
followed
up
her
tap
on
his
door
a
lady
to
see
you
sir
said
she
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
almost
a
wink
a
lady
to
see
me
good
lord
said
vernon
among
all
the
thoughts
of
the
day
this
was
the
one
thought
that
had
not
come
to
him
shall
i
show
her
in
the
woman
asked
and
she
eyed
him
curiously
a
lady
he
repeated
did
she
give
her
name
yes
sir
miss
desmond
sir
shall
i
shew
her
in
yes
shew
her
in
of
course
he
answered
irritably
and
to
himself
he
said
the
devil
chapter
vi
the
criminal
if
you
have
found
yourself
at
the
age
of
eighteen
a
prisoner
in
your
own
bedroom
you
will
be
able
to
feel
with
betty
not
otherwise
even
your
highly
strung
imagination
will
be
impotent
to
present
to
you
the
ecstasy
of
rage
terror
resentment
that
fills
the
soul
when
locked
door
and
barred
windows
say
quite
quietly
but
beyond
appeal
here
you
are
and
here
my
good
child
you
stay
all
the
little
familiar
objects
the
intimate
associations
of
the
furniture
of
a
room
that
has
been
for
years
your
boudoir
as
well
as
your
sleeping
room
all
the
decorations
that
you
fondly
dreamed
gave
to
your
room
a
the
mark
of
a
distinctive
personality
these
are
of
no
more
comfort
to
you
than
would
be
strange
bare
stone
walls
and
a
close
unfamiliar
iron
grating
betty
tried
to
shake
the
window
bars
but
they
were
immovable
she
tried
to
force
the
door
open
but
her
silver
buttonhook
was
an
insufficient
lever
and
her
handle
broke
when
she
pitted
it
in
conflict
against
the
heavy
lock
we
have
all
read
how
prisoners
outwitting
their
gaolers
have
filed
bars
with
their
pocket
and
cut
the
locks
out
of
old
oak
doors
with
the
small
blade
of
a
penknife
betty
door
was
only
of
pine
but
her
knife
broke
off
short
and
the
file
on
her
little
scissors
wore
itself
smooth
against
the
first
unmoved
bar
she
paced
the
room
like
a
caged
lioness
we
read
that
did
the
lioness
but
know
her
strength
her
bars
were
easily
shattered
by
one
blow
of
her
powerful
paw
betty
little
pink
paws
were
not
powerful
like
the
lioness
and
when
she
tried
to
make
them
help
her
she
broke
her
nails
and
hurt
herself
it
was
this
moment
that
letitia
chose
for
rapping
at
the
door
you
ca
come
in
what
is
it
betty
was
prompt
to
say
edwardes
albert
miss
come
for
the
maternity
bag
it
all
ready
in
the
cupboard
betty
called
through
the
door
number
three
she
resisted
an
impulse
to
say
that
she
had
broken
the
key
in
the
lock
and
to
send
for
the
locksmith
no
there
should
be
no
scandal
at
long
barton
at
least
not
while
she
had
to
stay
in
it
she
did
not
cry
she
was
sick
with
fury
and
anger
made
her
heart
beat
as
vernon
had
never
had
power
to
make
it
i
will
be
calm
i
wo
lose
my
head
she
told
herself
again
and
again
she
drank
some
water
she
made
herself
eat
the
neglected
breakfast
she
got
out
her
diary
and
wrote
in
it
in
a
handwriting
that
was
not
betty
and
with
a
hand
that
shook
like
what
will
become
of
me
what
has
become
of
my
must
have
done
something
horrible
to
him
perhaps
he
has
had
him
put
in
prison
of
course
he
could
do
that
in
these
modern
times
like
in
the
french
revolution
just
for
talking
to
some
one
he
had
been
introduced
to
but
he
may
have
done
it
for
trespassing
or
damage
to
the
crops
or
something
i
feel
quite
certain
something
has
happened
to
him
he
would
never
have
deserted
me
like
this
in
my
misery
if
he
were
free
and
i
can
do
nothing
to
help
him
nothing
how
shall
i
live
through
the
day
how
can
i
bear
it
and
this
awful
trouble
has
come
upon
him
just
because
he
was
kind
to
another
artist
the
world
is
very
very
very
cruel
i
wish
i
were
dead
she
blotted
the
words
and
locked
away
the
book
then
she
burnt
that
farewell
note
and
went
and
sat
in
the
to
watch
for
her
return
the
time
was
long
at
last
he
came
she
saw
him
open
the
carriage
door
and
reach
out
a
flat
foot
feeling
for
the
carriage
step
he
stepped
out
turned
and
thrust
a
hand
back
into
the
cab
was
he
about
to
hand
out
a
protestant
sister
who
would
take
her
to
westerham
and
she
would
never
be
heard
of
again
betty
set
her
teeth
and
waited
anxiously
to
see
if
the
sister
seemed
strong
betty
was
and
she
would
fight
for
her
liberty
with
teeth
and
nails
if
need
were
it
was
no
protestant
sister
to
whom
the
reverend
cecil
had
reached
his
hand
it
was
only
his
umbrella
betty
breathed
again
well
now
at
least
he
come
and
speak
to
me
he
must
come
himself
even
could
give
the
key
to
the
servants
and
say
please
go
and
unlock
miss
lizzie
and
bring
her
down
betty
would
not
move
i
shall
just
stay
here
and
pretend
i
know
the
door
was
locked
said
she
but
her
impatience
drove
her
back
to
the
walk
and
when
at
last
she
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
door
she
had
only
just
time
to
spring
to
the
and
compose
herself
in
an
attitude
of
graceful
defiance
it
was
thrown
away
the
door
only
opened
wide
enough
to
admit
a
dinner
tray
pushed
in
by
a
hand
she
knew
then
the
door
closed
again
the
same
thing
happened
with
tea
and
supper
it
was
not
till
after
supper
that
betty
gazing
out
on
the
pale
watery
sunset
found
it
blurred
to
her
eyes
there
was
no
more
hope
now
she
was
a
prisoner
if
he
was
not
a
prisoner
he
ought
to
be
it
was
the
only
thing
that
could
excuse
his
silence
he
might
at
least
have
gone
by
the
gate
or
waved
a
handkerchief
well
all
was
over
between
them
and
betty
was
alone
in
the
world
she
had
not
cried
all
day
but
now
she
did
cry
vernon
always
prided
himself
on
having
a
heart
for
any
fate
but
this
was
one
of
the
interviews
that
one
would
rather
have
avoided
all
day
he
had
schooled
himself
to
resignation
had
almost
reconciled
himself
to
the
spoiling
of
what
had
promised
to
be
a
masterpiece
explications
with
betty
would
brush
the
bloom
off
everything
yet
he
must
play
the
part
well
but
what
part
oh
hang
all
meddlers
miss
desmond
said
the
landlady
and
he
braced
his
nerves
to
meet
a
tearful
an
indignant
or
a
desperate
betty
but
there
was
no
betty
to
be
met
no
betty
of
any
kind
instead
a
short
lady
walked
briskly
into
the
room
and
turned
to
see
the
door
well
closed
before
she
advanced
towards
him
he
bowed
with
indescribable
emotions
eustace
vernon
said
the
lady
she
wore
a
sensible
short
skirt
and
brown
boots
her
hat
was
and
her
abundant
hair
was
screwed
up
so
as
to
be
well
out
of
her
way
her
face
was
square
and
sensible
like
her
shoulders
and
her
boots
her
eyes
dark
clear
and
near
sighted
she
wore
spectacles
and
carried
a
cane
no
vision
could
have
been
less
like
betty
vernon
bowed
and
moved
a
chair
towards
her
thank
you
she
said
and
took
it
now
vernon
sit
down
too
and
let
talk
this
over
like
reasonable
beings
you
may
smoke
if
you
like
it
clears
the
brain
vernon
sat
down
and
mechanically
took
out
a
cigarette
but
he
held
it
unlighted
now
said
the
square
lady
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
i
am
betty
aunt
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
said
vernon
helplessly
not
at
all
she
briskly
answered
now
tell
me
all
about
it
there
nothing
to
tell
said
vernon
perhaps
it
will
clear
the
ground
a
little
if
i
say
at
once
that
i
have
come
to
ask
your
intentions
because
of
course
you
any
my
reverend
on
the
other
hand
insists
that
you
have
and
that
they
are
strictly
dishonourable
vernon
laughed
and
drew
a
breath
of
relief
i
fear
underwood
misunderstood
he
said
and
he
is
a
born
misunderstander
said
miss
julia
desmond
now
not
light
your
cigarette
man
you
can
give
me
one
if
you
like
to
keep
you
in
countenance
a
light
thanks
now
will
you
speak
or
shall
i
you
seem
to
have
more
to
say
than
i
miss
desmond
ah
that
because
you
do
trust
me
in
other
words
you
do
know
me
that
one
of
the
most
annoying
things
in
life
to
be
really
an
excellent
sort
and
to
be
quite
unable
to
make
people
see
it
at
the
first
well
here
goes
my
worthy
finds
you
and
my
niece
holding
hands
in
a
shed
we
were
not
said
vernon
i
was
telling
her
fortune
it
my
lead
now
interrupted
the
lady
your
turn
next
he
being
what
he
is
to
the
pure
all
things
are
impure
you
know
instantly
draws
the
most
harrowing
conclusions
hits
you
with
a
by
the
way
you
behaved
uncommonly
well
about
that
thank
you
said
vernon
smiling
a
little
it
is
pleasant
to
be
appreciated
yes
really
very
decently
indeed
i
daresay
it
would
have
hurt
a
fly
but
if
you
been
the
sort
of
man
he
thinks
you
are
however
that
neither
here
nor
there
he
hits
you
with
a
stick
locks
the
child
into
her
room
what
did
you
say
nothing
said
vernon
all
right
i
did
hear
it
locks
her
in
her
room
and
wires
to
my
sister
takes
a
carriage
to
sevenoaks
to
do
it
too
to
avoid
scandal
i
happen
to
be
at
my
sister
on
my
way
from
cairo
to
norway
so
i
undertake
to
run
down
he
meets
me
at
the
station
and
wants
me
to
go
straight
home
and
blackguard
betty
but
i
prefer
to
deal
with
principals
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
whatever
has
happened
has
been
your
doing
and
not
that
dear
little
idiot
now
are
you
going
to
tell
me
about
it
he
had
rehearsed
already
a
form
of
words
in
which
brother
artists
should
have
loomed
large
but
now
that
he
rose
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spoke
it
was
in
words
that
had
not
been
rehearsed
look
here
miss
desmond
said
he
the
fact
is
you
right
i
have
any
intentions
certainly
not
dishonourable
ones
but
i
was
frightfully
bored
in
the
country
and
your
niece
is
bored
too
more
bored
than
i
am
no
one
ever
understands
or
pities
the
boredom
of
the
very
young
he
added
pensively
well
well
that
all
there
is
to
it
i
liked
meeting
her
and
she
liked
meeting
me
and
the
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
did
enjoy
holding
the
child
hand
and
putting
her
in
a
silly
flutter
i
deny
the
flutter
he
said
but
well
yes
of
course
i
enjoyed
it
you
would
believe
me
if
i
said
i
did
no
said
she
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
expected
to
he
added
with
a
frankness
that
he
had
not
meant
to
use
much
more
but
i
did
say
a
word
of
love
perhaps
only
perhaps
you
made
the
idea
of
it
underlie
every
word
you
did
speak
do
i
know
said
miss
desmond
bless
the
man
i
been
young
myself
miss
betty
is
very
charming
said
he
and
and
if
i
had
met
her
if
you
had
met
her
some
other
man
would
true
but
i
fancy
her
father
would
rather
it
had
been
some
other
man
i
did
mean
that
in
the
least
said
vernon
with
some
heat
i
meant
that
if
i
had
met
her
she
would
have
gone
on
being
bored
and
so
should
i
do
think
me
a
humbug
miss
desmond
i
am
more
sorry
than
i
can
say
that
i
should
have
been
the
means
of
causing
her
any
unhappiness
her
unhappiness
poor
little
betty
poor
little
trusting
innocent
silly
little
girl
that
about
it
is
it
it
was
so
like
it
that
he
hotly
answered
not
in
the
least
well
well
said
miss
desmond
there
no
great
harm
done
get
over
it
and
more
been
lost
on
market
days
thanks
she
lighted
a
second
cigarette
and
sat
very
upright
the
cigarette
in
her
mouth
and
her
hands
on
the
handle
of
her
stick
you
ca
help
it
of
course
men
with
your
coloured
eyes
never
can
that
green
hazel
girls
ought
to
be
taught
at
school
that
it
a
only
since
your
heart
not
in
the
business
any
more
than
her
is
as
you
say
you
were
both
bored
to
death
i
want
to
ask
you
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
just
to
let
the
whole
thing
drop
let
the
girl
alone
go
right
away
it
an
unimportant
detail
and
i
ashamed
to
mention
it
said
vernon
but
i
got
a
picture
on
hand
i
painting
a
bit
of
the
warren
well
go
to
low
barton
and
put
up
there
and
finish
your
precious
picture
you
wo
see
betty
again
unless
you
run
after
her
to
tell
the
truth
said
vernon
i
had
already
decided
to
let
the
whole
thing
drop
i
ashamed
of
the
trouble
i
caused
her
and
and
i
taken
rooms
at
low
barton
upon
my
word
said
miss
desmond
you
are
the
coldest
lover
ever
set
eyes
on
i
not
a
lover
he
answered
swiftly
do
you
wish
i
were
for
betty
sake
i
glad
you
are
but
i
think
i
should
respect
you
more
if
you
were
quite
so
arctic
i
not
an
incendiary
at
any
rate
said
he
and
that
something
with
my
coloured
eyes
is
it
well
she
said
whatever
your
temperature
is
i
rather
like
you
i
do
wonder
at
betty
in
the
least
vernon
bowed
all
i
ask
is
your
promise
that
you
not
speak
to
her
again
i
ca
promise
that
you
know
i
ca
be
rude
to
her
but
promise
not
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
meet
her
again
he
sighed
as
yes
it
is
sad
all
that
time
wasted
and
no
rabbits
caught
again
miss
desmond
had
gone
unpleasantly
near
his
thought
of
course
he
said
you
do
understand
me
near
enough
said
miss
desmond
and
now
i
go
let
me
thank
you
for
coming
said
vernon
eagerly
it
was
more
than
good
of
you
i
must
own
that
my
heart
sank
when
i
knew
it
was
miss
betty
aunt
who
honoured
me
with
a
visit
but
i
am
most
glad
you
came
i
never
would
have
believed
that
a
lady
could
be
so
reasonable
and
and
and
gentlemanly
said
the
lady
yes
it
my
who
is
the
old
woman
poor
dear
you
see
vernon
i
been
running
round
the
world
for
five
and
twenty
years
and
i
kept
my
eyes
open
and
when
i
was
of
an
age
to
be
silly
the
man
i
was
silly
about
had
your
coloured
eyes
he
married
an
actress
poor
fellow
or
rather
she
married
him
before
he
could
say
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
happen
to
you
unless
you
uncommonly
careful
so
settled
you
give
me
your
word
not
to
try
to
see
betty
i
give
you
my
word
you
wo
believe
in
my
regret
i
believe
in
that
right
enough
it
must
be
simply
sickening
to
have
the
whole
show
given
away
like
this
oh
i
believe
in
your
regret
my
regret
said
vernon
steadily
for
any
pain
i
may
have
caused
your
niece
do
please
see
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
having
seen
at
once
that
it
was
not
her
fault
at
all
but
wholly
mine
very
nicely
said
good
boy
said
betty
aunt
well
my
excellent
is
waiting
outside
in
the
fly
gnashing
his
respectable
teeth
no
doubt
and
inferring
all
sorts
of
complications
from
the
length
of
our
interview
you
just
the
sort
of
young
man
i
like
and
i
sorry
we
have
met
on
a
happier
footing
i
sure
we
should
have
got
on
together
do
you
think
so
i
sure
we
should
said
he
truly
may
i
hope
she
laughed
outright
you
have
indeed
the
passion
for
acquaintance
without
introduction
she
said
no
you
may
call
on
me
in
town
besides
i
never
there
and
take
care
of
yourself
you
bound
to
be
bitten
some
day
you
know
and
bitten
badly
i
wish
i
thought
you
forgave
me
forgive
you
of
course
i
forgive
you
you
can
no
more
help
making
love
i
suppose
no
do
interrupt
the
thing
the
same
whatever
you
call
it
you
can
no
more
help
making
love
than
a
cat
can
help
stealing
cream
only
one
day
the
cat
gets
caught
and
badly
beaten
and
one
day
you
get
caught
and
the
beating
will
be
a
bad
one
unless
i
a
greater
fool
than
i
take
myself
for
and
now
i
go
and
unlock
betty
prison
and
console
her
do
worry
about
her
i
see
that
she
not
put
upon
good
night
no
in
the
circumstances
better
see
me
to
my
carriage
she
shook
hands
cordially
and
left
vernon
to
his
thoughts
miss
desmond
had
done
what
she
came
to
do
and
he
knew
it
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
feel
that
now
he
could
not
try
to
see
betty
however
much
he
wished
it
however
much
he
might
know
her
to
wish
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lighted
another
cigarette
betty
worn
out
with
crying
had
fallen
asleep
the
sound
of
wheels
roused
her
it
seemed
to
rain
cabs
at
the
rectory
there
were
voices
in
the
hall
steps
on
the
stairs
her
door
was
unlocked
and
there
entered
no
tray
of
prisoner
fare
no
reproachful
no
protestant
sister
but
a
brisk
and
aunt
who
shut
the
door
and
spoke
all
in
the
dark
she
said
where
are
you
child
here
said
betty
let
me
strike
a
light
oh
yes
there

are
oh
aunt

he
sent
for
you
said
betty
fearfully
oh

me
auntie

am
so
tired
i
do
think
i
can
bear
any
more
i
not
going
to
scold

silly
little
kitten
said
the
aunt
cheerfully
come
buck
up
it
nothing
so
very
awful
after
all
you
be
laughing
at
it
all
before
a
fortnight
over
then
he
has
told
you
oh

he
has
he
told
me
everything
there
was
to
tell
and
a
lot
more
too
do
worry
child
you
just
go
straight
to
bed
and
tuck
you
up
and
we
talk
it
all
over
in
the
morning
aunty

betty
obediently
beginning
to
unfasten
her
dress
did
he
say
anything
about

little
he
has

done
anything
to
him

he
what

a
hanging
matter
bet
i
have

anything
from

all

and
i
thought

anything
more
of
him
betty
my
dear
i
seen
your
vernon
and
a
very
nice
young
man
he
is
too
he
frightfully
cut
up
about
having
got
you
into
a
row
and
he
sees
that
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
to
go
quietly
away
i
need
tell
you
betty
though
i
shall
have
to
explain
it
very
thoroughly
to
your
father
that
vernon
is
no
more
in
love
with
you
than
you
are
with
him
in
fact
engaged
to
another
girl
he
just
interested
in
you
as
a
promising
pupil
yes
said
betty
of
course
i
know
that
chapter
vii
the
escape
it
all
turned
out
exactly
like
what
i
said
it
was
going
to
exactly
to
a
t
said
symes
wrapping
her
wet
arms
in
her
apron
and
leaning
them
on
the
fence
if
it
was
that
it
tuesday
and
me
behindhand
as
it
is
i
tell
you
all
about
it
do
the
things
good
to
lay
a
bit
in
the
said
james
also
leaning
on
the
fence
sorter
whitens
them
what
i
always
say
i
do
mind
if
i
lend
you
a
hand
with
the
wringing
after
what
turned
out
like
you
said
it
was
going
to
miss
betty
decline
symes
laughed
low
and
huskily
what
did
i
tell
you
mrs
james
i
do
quite
remember
not
just
at
the
minute
said
james
you
tells
so
many
things
and
well
for
some
people
i
do
else
they
would
never
know
nothing
i
told
you
as
it
was
no
decline
miss
betty
was
setting
down
under
i
said
it
was
only
what
natural
her
being
the
age
she
is
i
said
what
she
wanted
was
a
young
man
and
i
said
she
get
one
and
what
do
you
think
i
do
know
i
sure
she
did
get
one
said
symes
impressively
that
same
week
just
as
if
she
been
to
my
very
words
it
was
as
it
might
be
friday
you
and
me
had
that
little
talk
well
as
it
might
be
the
saturday
she
meets
the
young
man
pictures
in
the
warren
my
ernest
youngest
saw
and
told
his
mother
when
he
come
home
to
his
dinner
to
think
of
that
and
me
never
hearing
a
word
said
james
with
frank
regret
i
knew
it
ud
be
and
i
come
to
you
my
lad
symes
went
on
with
cumbrous
enjoyment
and
so
it
was
they
used
to
keep
their
rondyvoos
in
the
wood
six
in
the
morning
tom
used
to
see
every
day
as
he
went
by
to
his
work
lor
said
james
feebly
of
course
tom
he
never
said
nothing
except
to
a
few
friends
of
his
over
a
glass
they
enjoyed
the
joke
i
promise
you
but
old
george
marbould
he
ai
never
been
quite
right
in
his
head
i
do
think
since
his
ruby
went
wrong
pity
i
always
think
a
great
clumsy
girl
like
her
might
a
kept
herself
respectable
she
the
temptation
some
of
us
might
have
had
in
our
young
days
no
indeed
said
james
smoothing
her
hair
and
old
george
what
silliness
was
he
up
to
this
time
why
he
sees
the
two
of
together
one
fine
morning
and
of
doing
like
he
be
done
by
he
ups
to
the
vicarage
and
tells
the
old
man
come
alonger
me
sir
says
he
have
a
look
at
your
daughter
and
huggin
up
in
beale
shed
along
of
a
perfect
stranger
so
the
old
man
he
says
bless
you
george
is
proud
of
him
saying
that
and
off
he
goes
in
a
regular
fanteague
beats
the
young
master
to
a
jelly
for
all
he
an
old
man
and
feeble
and
shuts
miss
up
in
her
room
now
that
would
a
been
way
no
indeed
said
james
i
should
a
asked
him
in
said
symes
if
it
had
been
a
gell
of
mine
and
give
him
a
good
meal
with
a
glass
of
ale
to
it
and
a
tiddy
drop
of
something
to
top
up
with
and
i
a
let
him
light
his
nasty
pipe
and
then
when
he
was
full
and
contented
i
a
up
and
said
my
man
you
time
to
think
it
over
and
no
one
ca
say
as
i
hurried
you
nor
flurried
you
but
it
time
as
we
began
talking
so
just
you
tell
me
what
you
to
do
about
it
if
you
the
feelings
of
a
man
i
a
said
marry
the
girl
yes
indeed
said
james
with
emotion
instead
of
which
bless
your
he
beats
the
young
man
off
with
a
stick
like
as
if
he
was
a
mad
dog
and
young
miss
is
a
goin
to
be
sent
to
furrin
parts
to
a
strick
boardin
school
to
learn
her
not
to
have
any
truck
with
young
chaps
i
call
it
said
james
an
well
you
may
crooil
how
he
expect
the
girl
to
get
a
husband
if
he
drives
the
young
fellers
away
with
pore
gell
i
should
wonder
but
what
she
lives
and
dies
a
maid
after
this
we
shall
miss
when
she
goes
said
james
i
do
say
we
sha
but
there
ai
no
one
as
you
ca
get
on
without
if
you
put
to
it
and
whether
or
not
she
going
to
far
foreign
parts
where
there
ai
no
young
chaps
poor
young
thing
said
james
very
sympathetic
i
think
drop
in
as
i
passing
and
see
how
she
takes
it
if
you
do
said
symes
unrolling
her
arms
white
and
wrinkled
with
washing
to
set
them
aggressively
on
her
lips
it
the
last
word
as
passes
between
us
james
so
now
you
know
lord
maria
do
fly
out
at
me
that
way
james
shrank
back
how
was
i
to
know
you
take
it
like
that
do
you
suppose
asked
symes
as
no
one
ai
got
no
legs
except
you
a
going
up
soon
as
i
got
the
things
on
the
line
and
cleaned
myself
i
only
heard
it
after
i
got
every
blessed
rag
in
soak
or
i
a
gone
up
afore
might
i
step
up
with
you
for
company
james
asked
no
you
might
but
i
do
mind
dropping
in
as
i
come
home
to
tell
you
about
it
one
of
them
catholic
nunnery
schools
i
expect
which
it
sudden
death
to
a
man
but
to
set
his
foot
into
poor
young
thing
said
james
again
betty
was
going
to
paris
there
had
been
much
talk
about
and
about
the
project
now
it
was
to
be
there
had
been
interviews
there
was
the
first
in
which
the
elder
miss
desmond
told
her
in
the
plain
speech
she
loved
exactly
what
sort
of
a
fool
he
had
made
of
himself
in
the
matter
of
betty
and
the
when
he
was
convinced
of
error
it
was
not
easily
done
he
would
have
liked
to
tell
betty
that
he
was
sorry
but
he
belonged
to
a
generation
that
does
not
apologise
to
the
next
the
second
interview
was
between
the
aunt
and
betty
that
was
the
one
in
which
so
much
good
advice
was
given
you
know
the
aunt
wound
up
all
young
women
want
to
be
in
love
and
all
young
men
too
i
do
mean
that
there
was
anything
of
that
sort
between
you
and
your
artist
friend
but
there
might
have
been
now
look
here
i
going
to
speak
quite
straight
to
you
do
you
ever
let
young
men
get
monkeying
about
with
your
hands
whether
they
call
it
or
whether
they
do
their
reason
for
doing
so
is
always
the
same
or
likely
to
be
and
you
want
to
keep
your
hand
as
well
as
your
lips
for
the
man
you
going
to
marry
all
but
do
you
forget
it
now
what
this
i
hear
about
your
wanting
to
go
to
paris
i
did
want
to
go
said
betty
but
i
do
care
about
anything
now
everything
hateful
it
always
is
said
the
aunt
but
it
wo
always
be
do
think
i
care
a
straw
about
not
seeing
vernon
again
said
betty
hastily
it
not
that
of
course
not
said
the
aunt
sympathetically
no
but
father
was
so
hateful
you
no
idea
if
i
if
i
run
away
and
got
married
secretly
he
could
have
made
more
fuss
you
a
little
harsh
just
a
little
of
course
you
and
i
know
exactly
how
it
was
but
remember
how
it
looked
to
him
why
it
could
have
looked
worse
if
you
really
been
arranging
an
elopement
he
got
his
arm
around
me
insisted
betty
it
was
somewhere
right
away
in
the
background
he
was
holding
himself
up
with
it
do
i
tell
you
i
understand
all
that
perfectly
what
i
want
to
understand
is
how
you
feel
about
paris
are
you
absolutely
off
the
idea
i
could
go
if
i
was
i
wonder
what
you
think
paris
is
like
mused
the
aunt
i
suppose
you
think
it
all
one
wild
one
delirious
round
of
of
museums
and
picture
galleries
no
i
do
said
betty
rather
shortly
if
you
went
you
have
to
work
there
no
chance
of
my
going
then
we
put
the
idea
away
and
say
no
more
about
it
get
me
my
continental
bradshaw
out
of
my
i
no
use
here
nobody
loves
me
and
i
go
to
norway
by
the
first
omnibus
morning
do
said
betty
how
can
you
say
nobody
loves
you
your
does
anyway
that
why
i
can
make
him
do
what
i
like
when
i
take
the
trouble
when
people
love
you
they
never
do
anything
for
you
not
even
answer
a
plain
question
with
a
plain
yes
or
no
go
and
get
the
bradshaw
you
be
sorry
when
i
gone
aunt
julia
you
do
really
mean
it
of
course
not
i
never
mean
anything
except
the
things
i
do
say
the
bradshaw
betty
came
and
sat
on
the
arm
of
her
aunt
chair
it
not
fair
to
tease
me
she
said
and
tantalise
me
you
know
how
mizzy
i
am
no
i
do
know
anything
you
wo
tell
me
anything
go
and
get
dear
darling
pretty
kind
clever
aunt
cried
betty
i
give
my
ears
to
go
then
borrow
a
large
knife
from
cook
and
sharpen
it
on
the
front
no
i
do
mean
to
use
it
on
your
i
have
your
pretty
ears
mummified
and
wear
them
on
my
no
mind
my
spectacles
let
me
go
i
daresay
it
wo
come
to
anything
do
you
really
mean
you
take
me
i
take
you
fast
enough
but
i
would
keep
you
we
must
find
a
dragon
to
guard
the
princess
oh
we
get
a
nice
tame
kind
of
a
dragon
but
that
dragon
will
not
be
your
aunt
julia
let
me
go
i
say
i
thought
you
did
care
about
anything
any
more
i
did
know
there
could
be
anything
to
care
for
said
betty
honestly
especially
paris
well
i
wo
if
you
hate
it
so
but
oh
aunt
she
still
sat
on
the
floor
by
the
chair
her
aunt
had
left
and
thought
and
thought
the
aunt
went
straight
down
to
the
study
now
cecil
she
said
coming
briskly
in
and
shutting
the
door
you
made
that
poor
child
hate
the
thought
of
you
and
you
only
yourself
to
thank
i
know
you
think
so
said
he
closing
the
heavy
book
over
which
he
had
been
stooping
i
do
mean
she
added
hastily
for
she
was
not
a
cruel
woman
that
she
really
hates
you
of
course
but
you
frightened
her
and
shaken
her
nerves
locking
her
up
in
her
room
like
that
upon
my
word
you
are
old
enough
to
know
better
i
was
so
alarmed
so
shaken
myself
he
began
but
she
interrupted
him
i
did
come
in
and
disturb
your
work
just
to
say
all
that
of
course
she
said
but
really
cecil
i
understand
things
better
than
you
think
i
know
how
fond
you
really
are
of
betty
the
reverend
cecil
doubted
this
but
he
said
nothing
and
you
know
that
i
fond
enough
of
the
child
myself
now
all
this
has
upset
you
both
tremendously
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
i
nothing
i
thought
the
less
said
about
these
deplorable
affairs
the
better
lizzie
will
soon
recover
her
natural
tone
and
forget
all
about
the
matter
then
you
mean
to
let
everything
go
on
in
the
old
way
why
of
course
said
he
uneasily
well
it
your
own
affair
naturally
she
spoke
with
a
studied
air
of
detachment
which
worried
him
exactly
as
it
was
meant
to
do
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
anxiously
he
had
never
been
able
wholly
to
approve
miss
julia
desmond
she
smoked
cigarettes
and
he
could
not
think
that
this
would
have
been
respectable
in
any
other
woman
of
course
she
was
different
from
any
other
woman
but
still
then
the
reverend
cecil
could
not
deem
it
womanly
to
explore
unchaperoned
the
less
quarters
of
four
continents
to
penetrate
even
to
regions
where
skirts
were
considered
improper
and
were
unknown
even
the
nearness
of
miss
desmond
fiftieth
birthday
hardly
lessened
at
all
the
poignancy
of
his
disapproval
besides
she
had
not
always
been
fifty
and
she
had
always
in
his
recollection
of
her
smoked
cigarettes
and
travelled
alone
yet
he
had
a
certain
respect
for
her
judgment
and
for
that
fine
luminous
of
hers
which
had
more
than
once
shewn
him
his
own
mistakes
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
and
she
had
differed
he
had
always
realized
later
that
she
had
been
in
the
right
and
she
was
gentlemanly
enough
never
once
to
have
said
i
told
you
so
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
again
for
she
was
silent
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
long
coat
her
sensible
brown
shoes
sticking
straight
out
in
front
of
her
chair
if
you
really
want
to
know
i
tell
you
she
said
but
i
hate
to
interfere
in
other
people
business
you
see
i
know
how
deeply
she
has
felt
this
and
of
course
i
know
you
have
too
so
i
wondered
whether
you
had
thought
of
some
little
plan
for
for
altering
the
circumstances
a
little
so
that
everything
will
blow
over
and
settle
down
so
that
when
you
and
she
come
together
again
you
be
better
friends
than
ever
come
together
again
he
repeated
and
the
was
still
restless
do
you
want
me
to
let
her
go
away
to
london
visions
of
lizzie
in
unseemly
dresses
surrounded
by
crowds
of
young
men
all
possible
vernons
lent
a
sudden
firmness
to
his
voice
a
sudden
alertness
to
his
manner
no
certainly
not
she
answered
the
voice
and
the
manner
as
much
as
the
words
i
should
dream
of
such
a
thing
then
it
had
occurred
to
you
it
certainly
had
not
you
see
she
said
earnestly
it
like
this
at
least
this
is
how
i
see
it
she
all
shaken
and
upset
and
so
are
you
and
when
gone
and
i
must
go
in
a
very
little
time
you
both
of
you
simply
settle
down
to
thinking
over
it
all
and
you
grow
farther
and
farther
apart
i
do
think
so
said
he
things
like
this
always
right
themselves
if
one
leaves
them
alone
lizzie
and
i
have
always
got
on
very
well
together
in
a
quiet
way
we
are
neither
of
us
demonstrative
now
heaven
help
the
man
was
the
woman
thought
she
remembered
betty
clinging
arms
her
heartfelt
kisses
the
fervency
of
the
voice
that
said
dear
darling
pretty
kind
clever
aunt
i
give
my
ears
to
go
betty
not
demonstrative
heaven
help
the
man
no
she
said
i
know
but
when
people
are
young
these
thinks
rankle
they
wo
with
her
he
said
she
has
a
singularly
noble
nature
under
that
quiet
exterior
miss
desmond
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
afresh
then
there
another
thing
she
fretting
over
this
thinks
now
that
it
was
something
to
be
ashamed
of
she
did
think
so
at
the
time
of
course
you
mean
that
it
was
i
who
this
was
thin
ice
again
miss
desmond
skated
quickly
away
from
it
with
well
you
see
i
been
talking
to
her
she
really
fretting
why
she
got
ever
so
much
thinner
in
the
last
week
i
could
get
a
locum
he
said
slowly
and
take
her
to
a
hydropathic
establishment
for
a
fortnight
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
miss
desmond
to
herself
aloud
she
said
that
be
delightful
later
but
just
now
well
of
course
for
you
to
decide
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
two
to
be
apart
for
a
while
if
you
here
alone
together
well
the
very
sight
of
you
will
remind
each
other
that
not
grammar
as
you
say
but
he
had
not
said
anything
he
was
thinking
fingering
the
brass
bosses
on
the
corners
of
the
divine
augustine
and
tracing
the
pattern
on
the
stamped
pigskin
of
course
if
you
care
to
risk
it
she
went
on
still
with
that
fine
air
of
detachment
but
i
have
seen
breaches
that
nothing
could
heal
arise
in
just
that
way
two
people
sitting
down
together
and
thinking
over
everything
they
had
against
each
other
but
i
nothing
against
lizzie
i
daresay
not
miss
desmond
lost
patience
at
last
but
she
has
against
you
or
will
have
if
you
let
her
stay
here
brooding
over
it
however
if
you
like
to
risk
it
i
sorry
i
spoke
she
got
up
and
moved
to
the
door
no
no
he
said
hastily
do
not
be
sorry
you
spoke
you
have
given
me
food
for
reflection
i
will
think
it
all
over
quietly
and
and
he
did
not
like
to
talk
about
prayers
to
miss
desmond
somehow
and
calmly
and
if
i
see
that
you
are
right
i
am
sure
you
mean
most
kindly
by
me
indeed
i
do
she
said
heartily
and
gave
him
her
hand
in
the
manly
way
he
hated
he
took
it
held
it
limply
an
instant
and
repeated
most
kindly
he
thought
it
over
for
so
long
that
the
aunt
almost
lost
hope
i
have
to
hold
my
tongue
with
both
hands
to
keep
it
quiet
and
if
i
say
another
word
i
shall
spoil
the
song
she
told
betty
i
done
my
absolute
best
if
that
does
fetch
him
nothing
will
it
had
fetched
him
at
the
end
of
two
interminable
days
he
sent
to
ask
miss
desmond
to
speak
to
him
in
the
study
she
went
i
have
been
thinking
carefully
he
said
most
carefully
and
i
feel
that
you
are
right
perhaps
i
owe
her
some
amends
do
you
know
of
any
quiet
country
place
miss
desmond
thought
betty
had
perhaps
for
the
moment
had
almost
enough
of
quiet
country
places
she
is
very
anxious
to
learn
drawing
he
said
and
perhaps
if
i
permitted
her
to
do
so
she
might
understand
it
as
a
sign
that
i
cherish
no
resentment
on
account
of
what
has
passed
but
i
know
the
very
thing
said
the
aunt
and
went
on
to
tell
of
madame
gautier
of
her
cloistral
home
in
paris
where
she
received
a
few
favoured
young
girls
of
the
vigilant
maid
who
conducted
them
to
and
from
their
studies
of
the
quiet
villa
on
the
marne
where
in
the
summer
an
able
master
at
least
or
years
of
age
conducted
sketching
parties
to
which
the
students
were
accompanied
either
by
madame
herself
or
by
the
i
stand
the
child
six
months
with
her
she
said
or
a
year
even
so
it
wo
cost
you
anything
and
madame
gautier
is
in
london
now
you
could
run
up
and
talk
to
her
yourself
does
she
speak
english
he
asked
anxiously
and
being
reassured
questioned
further
and
you
he
asked
and
when
he
heard
that
norway
for
a
month
and
then
america
en
route
for
japan
formed
miss
desmond
programme
for
the
next
year
he
was
only
just
able
to
mask
with
a
cough
his
deep
sigh
of
relief
for
however
much
he
might
respect
her
judgment
he
was
always
easier
when
lizzie
and
her
aunt
julia
were
not
together
he
went
up
to
town
and
found
madame
gautier
the
widow
of
a
french
pastor
established
in
a
bloomsbury
she
was
a
woman
after
his
own
heart
severe
simple
earnest
if
he
had
to
part
with
his
lizzie
he
told
himself
in
the
returning
train
it
could
be
to
no
better
keeper
than
this
he
himself
announced
his
decision
to
betty
i
have
decided
he
said
and
he
spoke
very
coldly
because
it
was
so
very
difficult
to
speak
at
all
to
grant
you
the
wish
you
expressed
some
time
ago
you
shall
go
to
paris
and
learn
drawing
do
you
really
mean
it
said
betty
as
coldly
as
he
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
saying
things
which
i
do
not
mean
thank
you
very
much
said
betty
i
will
work
hard
and
try
that
the
money
sha
be
wasted
your
aunt
has
kindly
offered
to
pay
your
expenses
when
do
i
go
asked
betty
as
soon
as
your
garments
can
be
prepared
i
trust
that
i
shall
not
have
cause
to
regret
the
confidence
i
have
decided
to
place
in
you
his
phrasing
was
seldom
had
he
said
i
trust
you
my
child
and
i
know
i
sha
regret
it
which
was
what
he
meant
she
would
have
come
to
meet
him
more
than
as
it
was
she
said
thank
you
again
and
left
him
without
more
words
he
sighed
i
do
believe
she
is
pleased
after
all
but
she
sees
i
am
doing
it
for
her
good
now
it
comes
to
the
point
her
heart
sinks
at
the
idea
of
leaving
home
but
she
will
understand
my
motives
the
one
thought
betty
gave
him
was
he
ca
bear
the
sight
of
me
at
all
now
he
longing
to
be
rid
of
me
well
thank
heaven
i
going
to
paris
i
will
have
a
dress
over
green
with
three
rows
of
narrow
lace
insertion
and
a
hat
with
yellow
roses
and
oh
it
ca
be
true
it
too
good
to
be
true
well
it
a
good
thing
to
be
hated
sometimes
by
some
people
if
they
only
hate
you
enough
you
going
to
foreign
parts
miss
says
i
symes
had
flung
back
her
bonnet
strings
and
was
holding
a
saucerful
of
boiling
tea
skilfully
poised
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
symes
says
she
you
wish
you
was
going
too
she
says
and
she
laughed

blinded
and
well
i
see
as
she
only
laughed
to
a
bleedin

i
could
see
she
done
it
to
keep
the
tears
back
sorry
for
you
miss
i
sure
i
says
not

lose
the
chance
of

hope

a
blessing
to
you
i
do
that

be
a
blessing
right
enough
says
she
and
keeps
on
laughing
a
bit
wild
like
when

art

you
ca
always
stop
yourself
she
a
done
better
to
a
good
cry
and

need
but
no

your
eyes

and
says
she

james
unrolled
a
violet
petticoat
good
as
new
almost
she
said
looking
critically
at
the
hem
specially
her
being
me
so
what

be
cut
away
and
no
loss
she
kep
on
an
till
the
old
man

says
so

said
james
but
you

my
words
she
do
deceive
if

i
see
a
bruised
reed
and
a
broken
on
a
young
gell
face
i
see
it
on
hers
this
day
she
may
laugh
herself
black
in
the
face
but
she
laugh
me
into
thinking
what
i
knows
to
be
far
otherwise
ah
said
james
resignedly
we
all
it
to
bear
one
time
or
another
young
gells
is
very
deceitful
though
in
their
ways
they
book
the
man
chapter
viii
the
one
and
the
other
some
idiot
remarked
eustace
vernon
sipping
vermouth
at
a
little
table
insists
that
if
you
sit
long
enough
outside
the
café
de
la
paix
you
will
see
everyone
you
have
ever
known
or
ever
wanted
to
know
pass
by
i
have
sat
here
for
and
you
met
me
half
an
hour
ago
said
the
other
man
oh
said
vernon
affectionately
and
your
hat
has
gone
off
every
half
minute
ever
since
said
the
other
man
ah
that
to
the
people
i
known
it
the
people
i
wanted
to
know
that
are
the
rarity
do
you
mean
people
you
have
wanted
to
know
and
not
known
there
are
many
of
those
said
vernon
no
it
jove
that
a
sweet
woman
i
hate
the
type
said
the
other
man
briefly
all
clothes
no
real
human
being
the
woman
was
beautifully
dressed
in
the
key
whose
harmonies
are
only
mastered
by
frenchwomen
and
americans
she
turned
her
head
as
her
carriage
passed
and
vernon
hat
went
off
once
more
i
forgotten
her
profile
said
vernon
and
she
learned
how
to
dress
since
i
saw
her
last
she
quite
human
really
and
as
charming
as
anyone
ought
to
be
so
i
should
think
said
the
other
man
i
sorry
i
said
that
but
i
did
know
you
knew
her
how
trade
oh
i
did
a
picture
well
but
a
picture
i
did
it
in
england
in
the
spring
best
thing
i
done
yet
come
and
see
it
i
should
like
to
look
you
up
where
do
you
hang
out
bis
rue
notre
dame
des
champs
said
vernon
everyone
in
fiction
lives
there
it
the
only
street
on
the
other
side
that
authors
seem
ever
to
have
dreamed
of
still
it
convenient
so
i
herd
there
with
all
sorts
of
blackguards
heroes
and
villains
and
what
not
bis
i
come
said
the
other
man
slowly
do
you
know
vernon
like
awfully
to
get
at
your
point
of
view
your
philosophy
of
life
have
you
got
one
my
dear
chap
unto
is
my
motto
you
paint
pictures
the
other
went
on
so
very
much
too
good
for
the
sort
of
life
you
lead
vernon
laughed
my
dear
temple
he
said
i
live
mostly
the
life
of
a
vestal
virgin
you
know
well
enough
i
not
quarrelling
with
the
way
you
spend
your
evenings
said
his
dear
temple
it
your
whole
outlook
that
match
your
work
yet
there
must
be
some
relation
between
the
two
that
what
i
like
to
get
at
there
is
a
bond
stronger
than
friendship
stronger
than
love
a
bond
that
can
not
be
forged
in
any
other
shop
than
the
one
the
bond
between
old
schoolfellows
vernon
had
sometimes
wondered
why
he
stood
so
much
from
temple
it
is
a
wonder
that
old
schoolfellows
often
feel
mutually
the
subject
you
started
said
he
is
of
course
to
me
the
most
interesting
please
develop
your
thesis
well
then
your
pictures
are
good
strong
thorough
stuff
with
sentiment
yes
just
enough
sentiment
to
keep
them
from
the
brutality
of
degas
or
the
sensualism
of
latouche
whereas
you
yourself
seem
to
have
no
sentiment
i
no
sentiment
oh
bobby
this
is
too
much
why
i
a
mass
of
it
ask
yes
ask
any
woman
of
your
acquaintance
that
just
it
or
just
part
of
it
you
fool
them
into
thinking
oh
i
do
know
what
but
you
do
fool
me
i
have
tried
then
you
not
brutal
except
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
year
when
you
and
i
noticed
that
when
your
temper
goes
smash
your
morals
go
at
the
same
time
is
that
cause
or
effect
what
the
real
you
like
and
where
do
you
keep
it
the
real
me
said
vernon
is
seen
in
my
pictures
and
and
appreciated
by
my
friends
you
for
instance
are
i
believe
genuinely
attached
to
me
oh
rot
said
bobby
i
do
see
said
vernon
moving
his
iron
chair
to
make
room
for
two
people
at
the
next
table
why
you
should
expect
my
pictures
to
rhyme
with
my
life
a
man
art
does
rhyme
with
his
personality
most
often
it
contradicts
flatly
look
at
musicians
what
a
divine
art
and
what
pigs
of
high
priests
and
look
at
actors
but
no
one
ca
the
spectacle
is
too
sickening
i
sometimes
think
said
temple
emptying
his
glass
that
the
real
you
is
made
yet
it
waiting
for
for
the
refining
touch
of
a
woman
hand
eh
you
think
the
real
me
is
oh
temple
temple
i
no
heart
for
these
childish
imaginings
the
real
me
is
the
man
that
paints
pictures
damn
good
pictures
too
though
i
say
it
and
is
that
what
all
the
women
think
ask
them
my
dear
chap
ask
them
they
wo
tell
you
the
truth
they
not
the
only
ones
who
wo
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
really
think
of
women
vernon
i
do
think
about
them
at
all
lied
vernon
equably
they
subjects
for
thought
but
for
emotion
and
even
of
that
as
little
as
may
be
it
impossible
seriously
to
regard
a
woman
as
a
human
being
she
merely
a
dear
delightful
dainty
plaything
well
yes
or
rather
a
very
delicately
tuned
musical
instrument
if
you
know
the
scales
and
the
common
chords
you
can
improvise
nice
little
airs
and
charming
variations
she
a
sort
of
well
a
penny
whistle
and
the
music
you
get
depends
not
on
her
at
all
but
on
your
own
technique
i
never
been
in
love
said
temple
not
seriously
i
mean
he
hastened
to
add
for
vernon
was
smiling
not
a
life
or
death
matter
do
you
know
but
i
do
hate
the
way
you
talk
and
one
of
these
days
you
hate
it
too
miss
desmond
warning
floated
up
through
the
dim
waters
of
half
a
year
so
a
lady
told
me
only
last
spring
he
said
well
i
take
my
chance
going
well
i
glad
we
ran
across
each
other
do
forget
to
look
me
up
temple
moved
off
and
vernon
was
left
alone
he
sat
idly
smoking
cigarette
after
cigarette
and
watched
the
shifting
crowd
it
was
a
bright
october
day
and
the
crowd
was
a
gay
one
suddenly
his
fingers
tightened
on
his
cigarette
but
he
kept
the
hand
that
held
it
before
his
face
and
he
bent
his
head
forward
two
ladies
were
passing
on
foot
one
was
the
elder
miss
desmond
she
who
had
warned
him
that
one
of
these
days
he
would
be
caught
and
the
other
hanging
lovingly
on
her
aunt
arm
was
of
course
betty
but
a
smart
changed
awakened
betty
she
was
dressed
almost
as
beautifully
as
the
lady
whose
profile
he
had
failed
to
recognise
but
much
more
simply
her
eyes
were
alight
and
she
was
babbling
away
to
her
aunt
she
was
even
gesticulating
a
little
for
all
the
world
like
a
french
girl
he
noted
the
hand
with
which
she
emphasized
some
point
in
her
talk
that
the
hand
he
said
that
i
held
when
we
sat
on
the
plough
in
the
shed
and
i
told
her
fortune
he
had
risen
and
his
feet
led
him
along
the
road
they
had
taken
ten
yards
ahead
of
him
he
saw
the
swing
of
the
aunt
serviceable
brown
skirt
and
beside
it
betty
green
and
gray
i
am
not
breaking
my
word
he
replied
to
the
inward
monitor
going
out
of
his
way
to
speak
to
the
girl
he
watched
the
brown
gown
and
the
green
all
the
way
down
the
boulevard
des
capucines
saw
them
cross
the
road
and
go
up
the
steps
of
the
madeleine
he
paused
at
the
corner
it
was
hard
certainly
to
keep
his
promise
yet
so
far
it
was
easy
because
he
could
not
well
recall
himself
to
the
misses
desmond
on
the
ground
of
his
having
six
months
ago
involved
the
one
in
a
row
with
her
relations
and
discussed
the
situation
afterwards
with
the
other
i
do
wonder
where
they
staying
though
he
told
himself
if
one
were
properly
introduced
but
he
knew
that
the
aunt
would
consider
no
introduction
a
proper
one
that
should
renew
his
acquaintance
with
betty
wolf
wolf
he
said
let
the
fold
alone
there
no
door
for
you
and
you
pledged
your
sacred
word
as
an
honourable
wolf
not
to
jump
any
more
hurdles
and
as
he
stood
musing
the
elder
miss
desmond
came
down
the
church
steps
and
walked
briskly
away
some
men
would
doubtless
have
followed
her
example
if
not
her
direction
vernon
was
not
one
of
these
he
found
himself
going
up
the
steps
of
the
great
church
he
had
as
good
a
right
to
go
into
the
madeleine
as
the
next
man
he
would
probably
not
see
the
girl
if
he
did
he
would
not
speak
almost
certainly
he
would
not
even
see
her
but
destiny
had
remembered
vernon
once
more
betty
was
standing
just
inside
the
door
her
face
upturned
and
all
her
soul
in
her
eyes
the
mutterings
of
the
organ
and
the
voices
of
boys
filled
the
great
dark
building
he
went
and
stood
close
by
her
he
would
not
speak
he
would
keep
his
word
but
she
should
have
a
chance
of
speaking
his
eyes
were
on
her
face
the
hymn
ended
she
exhaled
a
held
breath
started
and
spoke
you
she
said
the
two
words
are
spelled
alike
spoken
they
are
capable
of
infinite
variations
the
first
you
sent
blood
leaping
the
second
froze
it
to
what
it
had
been
before
he
met
her
for
indeed
that
little
unfinished
idyll
had
been
almost
forgotten
by
the
man
who
sat
drinking
vermouth
outside
the
café
de
la
paix
how
are
you
he
whispered
wo
you
shake
hands
she
gave
him
a
limp
and
unresponsive
glove
i
had
almost
forgotten
you
she
said
but
i
am
glad
to
see
you
because
come
to
the
door
i
do
like
talking
in
churches
they
stood
on
the
steps
behind
one
of
the
great
pillars
do
you
think
it
is
wise
to
stand
here
he
said
your
aunt
might
see
us
so
you
followed
us
in
said
betty
with
perfect
that
was
very
kind
i
have
often
wished
to
see
you
to
tell
you
how
much
obliged
i
am
for
all
your
kindness
in
the
spring
i
was
only
a
child
then
and
i
did
understand
but
now
i
quite
see
how
good
it
was
of
you
why
do
you
talk
like
that
he
said
you
do
think
you
think
it
was
my
fault
your
fault
what
why
your
father
finding
us
and
oh
she
said
lightly
oh
i
had
forgotten
that
ridiculous
was
it
no
i
mean
your
kindness
in
giving
so
many
hours
to
teaching
a
perfect
duffer
well
now
i
seen
you
and
said
what
i
had
to
say
i
think
i
go
back
no
do
go
he
said
i
want
to
know
oh
all
sorts
of
things
i
can
see
your
aunt
from
afar
and
fly
if
she
approaches
you
do
suppose
said
betty
opening
her
eyes
at
him
that
i
sha
tell
her
i
seen
you
he
had
supposed
it
and
cursed
his
clumsiness
ah
i
see
she
went
on
you
think
i
should
deceive
my
aunt
now
because
i
deceived
my
in
the
spring
but
i
was
a
child
then
and
besides
i
fond
of
my
aunt
did
you
know
that
she
came
to
see
me
of
course
you
seem
to
think
we
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
deceit
mr
vernon
what
the
matter
with
you
he
said
bluntly
for
finer
weapons
seemed
useless
what
have
i
done
to
make
you
hate
me
i
hate
you
oh
no
not
in
the
least
said
betty
spitefully
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
all
your
kindness
where
are
you
staying
he
asked
hotel
bête
said
betty
off
her
guard
but
the
but
marked
his
first
score
i
wish
i
could
have
called
to
see
your
aunt
he
said
carelessly
but
i
am
off
to
vienna
betty
believed
that
she
did
not
change
countenance
by
a
breadth
i
hope
you
have
a
delightful
time
she
said
politely
thanks
i
am
sure
i
shall
the
only
consolation
for
leaving
paris
is
that
one
is
going
to
vienna
are
you
here
for
long
i
do
know
betty
was
on
her
guard
again
paris
is
a
delightful
city
is
it
most
charming
have
you
been
here
long
no
not
very
long
are
you
still
working
at
your
painting
it
would
be
a
pity
to
give
that
up
i
am
not
working
just
now
i
see
your
aunt
he
said
hurriedly
are
you
going
to
send
me
away
like
this
do
be
so
unjust
so
ungenerous
it
not
like
you
my
pupil
of
last
spring
was
not
unjust
your
pupil
of
last
spring
was
a
child
and
a
duffer
vernon
as
i
said
before
but
she
is
grateful
to
you
for
one
thing
no
two
what
the
other
he
asked
swiftly
your
she
demurely
answered
then
what
the
one
she
said
and
went
down
the
steps
to
meet
her
aunt
he
effaced
himself
behind
a
pillar
in
spite
of
her
new
coldness
he
could
not
believe
that
she
would
tell
her
aunt
of
the
meeting
and
he
was
right
though
betty
reasons
were
not
his
reasons
what
the
good
she
asked
herself
as
she
and
her
aunt
walked
across
to
their
hotel
he
going
away
and
i
shall
never
see
him
again
well
i
behaved
beautifully
that
one
thing
he
must
simply
loathe
me
so
that
all
right
if
he
were
staying
on
in
paris
of
course
i
would
tell
her
she
believed
this
fully
he
waited
five
minutes
behind
that
pillar
and
then
had
himself
driven
to
the
rue
notre
dame
des
champs
choosing
as
driver
a
man
with
a
white
hat
in
strict
accordance
with
the
advice
in
baedeker
though
he
had
never
read
any
of
the
works
of
that
author
this
new
betty
with
the
smart
gown
and
the
distant
manner
awoke
at
the
same
time
that
she
contradicted
his
memories
of
the
betty
of
long
barton
and
he
should
not
see
her
again
of
course
he
was
not
going
to
vienna
but
neither
was
he
going
to
hang
round
the
hotel
bête
or
to
bribe
franz
or
elise
to
smuggle
notes
to
miss
betty
it
never
any
use
trying
to
join
things
on
again
he
told
himself
as
well
try
to
mend
a
spider
web
when
you
have
put
your
boot
through
it
diver
brings
up
love
again
dropped
once
in
such
cold
seas
but
what
has
happened
why
does
she
hate
me
so
you
acted
very
nicely
dear
but
that
was
indifference
it
was
hatred
if
ever
i
seen
it
i
wonder
what
it
means
another
lover
no
then
she
be
sorry
for
me
it
something
that
belongs
to
me
not
another
shadow
but
what
i
shall
never
know
and
she
prettier
than
ever
too
oh
hang
it
his
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
on
the
shewed
the
white
square
of
an
envelope
a
note
from
the
other
woman
the
one
whose
profile
he
had
not
remembered
she
was
in
paris
for
a
time
she
had
seen
him
at
the
paix
had
wondered
whether
he
had
his
old
rooms
had
driven
straight
up
on
the
chance
of
being
able
to
leave
this
that
devotion
and
would
he
care
to
call
for
her
at
eight
and
they
could
dine
somewhere
and
talk
over
old
times
one
familiar
initial
that
of
her
first
name
curled
in
the
corner
and
the
card
smelt
of
jasmine
not
of
in
bottles
but
of
the
real
flower
he
had
never
known
how
she
managed
it
vernon
was
not
fond
of
talking
over
old
times
but
betty
would
be
dining
at
the
hotel
bête
some
dull
hole
no
doubt
he
had
never
heard
of
it
well
he
could
not
dine
at
the
bête
and
after
all
one
must
dine
somewhere
and
the
other
woman
had
never
bored
him
that
is
a
terrible
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
rival
and
betty
had
been
most
unjust
and
what
was
betty
to
him
anyway
his
thoughts
turned
to
the
american
girl
who
had
sketched
with
him
in
brittany
that
summer
ah
if
she
had
not
been
whisked
back
to
new
york
by
her
people
it
would
not
now
be
a
question
of
betty
or
of
the
jasmine
lady
he
took
out
miss
van
tromp
portrait
and
sat
looking
at
it
it
was
admirable
the
fearless
poise
of
the
head
the
laughing
eyes
the
full
pouting
lips
then
betty
face
and
the
face
of
the
jasmine
lady
came
between
him
and
miss
van
tromp
bah
he
said
smell
kiss
wear
at
last
throw
away
never
keep
a
rose
till
it
faded
a
little
tide
of
breton
memories
swept
through
him
bah
he
said
again
she
was
perfectly
charming
but
what
is
the
use
of
charm
half
the
world
away
he
pulled
his
trunk
from
the
front
of
the
pushed
up
the
iron
damper
and
made
a
little
fire
he
burned
all
miss
van
letters
and
her
photograph
but
from
habit
or
from
gratitude
he
kissed
it
before
he
burned
it
now
said
he
as
the
last
sparks
died
redly
on
the
black
embers
the
decks
are
cleared
for
action
shall
i
sentimentalise
about
betty
cold
cruel
changed
betty
or
shall
i
call
for
the
jasmine
lady
he
did
both
and
the
jasmine
lady
might
have
found
him
dull
as
it
happened
she
only
found
him
and
that
interested
her
when
we
parted
she
said
it
was
i
who
was
in
tears
now
it
you
what
is
it
if
i
am
in
tears
he
roused
himself
to
say
it
is
only
because
everything
passes
lasse
tout
passe
tout
casse
what
broken
now
she
asked
another
heart
oh
yes
you
broke
mine
all
to
little
little
bits
but
i
mended
it
i
wanted
frightfully
to
see
you
to
thank
you
this
is
a
grateful
day
for
women
thought
vernon
looking
the
interrogatory
why
for
showing
me
how
hearts
are
broken
she
explained
quite
easy
when
you
know
how
and
it
a
perfectly
delightful
game
i
play
it
myself
now
and
i
ca
imagine
how
i
ever
got
on
before
i
learned
the
rules
you
forget
he
said
smiling
it
was
you
who
broke
my
heart
and
it
not
mended
yet
that
very
sweet
of
you
but
really
you
know
i
very
glad
it
was
you
who
broke
my
heart
and
not
anyone
else
because
now
it
mended
that
gives
us
something
to
talk
about
we
have
a
past
that
really
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
and
that
such
a
bond
is
it
when
it
really
past
dead
you
know
no
nonsense
about
cataleptic
trances
but
stone
dead
yes
he
said
it
is
a
link
but
it
is
the
past
for
me
you
know
it
can
never
she
held
up
a
pretty
jewelled
hand
now
do
she
said
that
just
what
you
do
understand
all
that
out
of
the
picture
i
know
you
too
well
just
realize
that
the
only
nice
woman
you
know
who
does
either
expect
you
to
make
love
to
her
in
the
future
or
hate
you
for
having
done
it
in
the
past
and
you
want
to
see
me
every
day
think
of
the
novelty
of
it
i
do
and
i
do
said
he
and
i
wo
protest
any
more
while
in
this
mood
bear
with
me
if
i
seem
idiotic
i
been
burning
old
letters
and
that
always
makes
me
like
a
funeral
old
letters
mine
i
burned
yours
long
ago
and
it
is
two
years
since
we
parted
how
many
have
there
been
since
is
this
the
inquisition
or
is
it
durand
it
somewhere
where
we
both
are
she
said
without
a
trace
of
sentiment
that
good
enough
for
me
do
you
know
i
been
married
since
i
saw
you
last
left
a
widow
in
a
short
three
months
it
all
happened
and
well
i
not
very
clever
as
you
know
but
can
you
imagine
what
it
is
like
to
be
married
to
a
man
who
does
understand
a
single
word
you
say
unless
it
about
the
weather
or
things
to
eat
no
do
look
shocked
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
very
happy
till
the
motor
accident
took
him
and
left
me
this
she
shewed
a
scar
on
her
smooth
arm
what
a
woman
it
is
for
surprises
so
he
was
very
happy
but
of
course
he
was
yes
of
course
as
you
say
i
was
a
model
wife
i
wore
black
for
a
whole
year
too
why
did
you
marry
him
well
at
the
time
i
thought
you
might
hear
of
it
and
be
disappointed
or
hurt
or
something
so
i
am
said
vernon
with
truth
you
need
be
said
she
you
find
me
much
nicer
now
i
want
to
disappoint
you
or
hurt
you
but
only
to
have
a
good
time
and
there
no
nonsense
about
love
to
get
in
the
way
and
spoil
everything
so
you
but
this
is
proper
here
am
i
dining
with
a
lady
and
i
do
even
know
her
name
i
know
i
would
put
it
to
the
note
did
that
single
initial
arouse
your
suspicions
her
name
her
title
if
you
please
i
married
harry
craye
you
remember
how
we
used
to
laugh
at
him
together
that
little
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
st
craye
yes
she
said
de
mortuis
nil
nisi
bonum
of
the
dead
nothing
but
the
bones
if
he
had
lived
he
would
certainly
have
beaten
me
to
our
new
friendship
our
new
friendship
he
repeated
raising
his
glass
and
looking
in
her
eyes
lady
craye
looked
very
beautiful
and
betty
was
not
there
in
fact
just
now
there
was
no
betty
he
went
back
to
his
room
humming
a
song
of
yvette
guilbert
there
might
have
been
no
flowering
may
no
buttercup
meadows
in
all
the
world
for
any
thought
of
memory
that
he
had
of
them
and
betty
was
a
thousand
miles
away
that
was
at
night
in
the
morning
betty
was
at
the
hotel
bête
and
the
hotel
bête
was
no
longer
a
petty
little
hotel
which
he
did
not
know
and
never
should
know
for
the
early
post
brought
him
a
letter
which
said
i
am
in
paris
for
a
few
days
and
should
like
to
see
you
if
you
can
make
it
convenient
to
call
at
my
hotel
on
thursday
this
was
tuesday
the
letter
was
signed
with
the
name
of
the
uncle
from
whom
vernon
had
expectations
and
at
the
head
of
the
letter
was
the
address
hôtel
bête
cité
de
retraite
rue
boissy
now
bear
witness
cried
vernon
appealing
to
the
universe
bear
witness
that
this
is
my
fault
chapter
ix
the
opportunity
vernon
in
those
two
days
decided
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
betty
again
she
was
angry
with
him
and
though
he
never
for
an
instant
distrusted
his
power
to
dissipate
the
cloud
he
felt
that
the
lifting
of
it
would
leave
him
and
her
in
that
strong
light
wherein
the
frail
flower
of
sentiment
must
wither
and
perish
explications
were
fatal
to
the
delicate
mystery
the
ethereal
that
vernon
loved
above
all
things
he
detested
the
already
a
mood
of
much
daylight
was
making
him
blink
and
shrink
he
saw
himself
as
he
was
or
nearly
and
the
spectacle
did
not
please
him
the
thought
of
lady
craye
was
the
only
one
that
seemed
to
make
for
any
sort
of
complacency
the
thought
of
temple
rankled
oddly
he
likes
me
and
he
dislikes
himself
for
liking
me
why
does
he
like
me
why
does
anyone
like
me
i
hanged
if
i
know
this
was
the
other
side
of
his
mood
of
most
days
when
the
wonder
seemed
that
everyone
should
not
like
him
why
should
they
ordinarily
he
was
hanged
if
he
knew
that
he
had
expected
a
note
from
lady
craye
to
follow
up
his
dinner
with
her
he
knew
how
a
woman
rarely
resists
the
temptation
to
write
to
the
man
in
whom
she
is
interested
even
while
his
last
words
are
still
ringing
in
her
ears
but
no
note
came
and
he
concluded
that
lady
craye
was
not
interested
this
reassured
while
it
piqued
the
hotel
bête
is
very
near
the
madeleine
and
very
near
the
heart
of
paris
of
gay
paris
that
is
yet
it
might
have
been
a
hundred
miles
from
anywhere
you
go
along
the
rue
boissy
and
stopping
at
a
gateway
you
turn
into
a
dreary
paved
court
which
is
the
cité
de
la
retraite
here
the
doors
of
the
hotel
bête
open
before
you
like
the
portals
of
a
mausoleum
there
is
no
greeting
from
the
patronne
your
arrival
gives
rise
to
no
pleasant
welcoming
bustle
the
concierge
receives
you
and
you
see
at
once
that
her
cheerful
smile
is
assumed
no
one
could
really
be
cheerful
at
the
hotel
bête
vernon
felt
as
though
he
was
entering
a
family
vault
of
the
highest
respectability
when
he
passed
through
its
silent
hall
and
enquired
for
james
vernon
monsieur
vernon
was
out
no
he
had
charged
no
one
with
a
billet
for
monsieur
monsieur
vernon
would
doubtless
return
for
the
déjeûner
it
was
certain
that
he
would
return
for
the
diner
would
monsieur
wait
monsieur
waited
in
a
little
stiff
salon
with
glass
doors
prim
furniture
and
an
elaborately
ornamental
french
clock
it
was
silent
of
course
one
wonders
sometimes
whether
ornamental
french
ormolu
clocks
have
any
works
or
are
solid
throughout
for
no
one
has
ever
seen
one
of
them
going
there
were
english
papers
on
the
table
and
the
new
york
herald
through
the
glass
doors
he
could
see
everyone
who
came
in
or
went
out
and
he
saw
no
one
there
was
a
stillness
as
of
the
tomb
even
the
waiter
now
laying
covers
for
the
déjeûner
wore
list
slippers
and
his
movements
were
silent
as
a
heron
flight
he
came
to
the
glass
door
presently
did
monsieur
breakfast
vernon
was
not
minded
to
waste
two
days
in
the
pursuit
of
uncles
here
he
was
and
here
he
stayed
till
uncle
james
should
appear
yes
decidedly
monsieur
breakfasted
he
wondered
where
the
clients
of
the
hotel
had
hidden
themselves
were
they
all
dead
or
merely
as
his
watch
shewed
him
the
approach
of
twelve
he
found
himself
listening
for
the
tramp
of
approaching
feet
the
rustle
of
returning
skirts
and
still
all
was
silent
as
the
grave
the
sudden
summoning
sound
of
a
bell
roused
him
from
a
dreamy
wonder
as
to
whether
betty
and
her
aunt
had
already
left
if
not
should
he
meet
them
at
déjeûner
the
idea
of
the
possible
meeting
amused
more
than
it
interested
him
he
crossed
the
hall
and
entered
the
long
bare
salle
á
manger
by
heaven
he
was
the
only
guest
a
cover
was
laid
for
him
only
no
at
a
distance
of
half
the
table
for
another
then
betty
and
her
aunt
had
gone
well
so
much
the
better
he
unfolded
his
in
another
moment
doubtless
uncle
james
would
appear
to
fill
the
vacant
place
but
in
another
moment
the
vacant
place
was
filled
and
by
betty
betty
alone
unchaperoned
and
bristling
with
hostility
she
bowed
very
coldly
but
she
was
crimson
to
the
ears
he
rose
and
came
to
her
holding
out
his
hand
with
the
waiter
looking
on
betty
had
to
give
hers
but
she
gave
it
in
a
way
that
said
very
plainly
i
am
very
surprised
and
not
at
all
pleased
to
see
you
here
this
is
a
most
unexpected
pleasure
he
said
very
distinctly
and
added
the
truth
about
his
uncle
has
monsieur
vernon
yet
returned
he
asked
the
waiter
who
hovered
anxiously
near
no
monsieur
was
not
yet
of
return
so
you
see
his
look
answered
the
speech
of
her
hand
it
is
not
my
doing
in
the
least
i
hope
your
aunt
is
well
he
went
on
the
waiter
handing
baked
eggs
the
while
quite
well
thank
you
said
betty
and
how
is
your
wife
i
ought
to
have
asked
yesterday
but
i
forgot
my
wife
oh
perhaps
you
are
married
yet
of
course
my
father
told
me
of
your
engagement
she
crumbled
bread
and
smiled
pleasantly
so
it
thought
vernon
fool
that
i
was
to
forget
it
i
am
not
married
he
said
coldly
nor
have
i
ever
been
engaged
to
be
married
and
he
ate
eggs
stolidly
wondering
what
her
next
move
would
be
it
was
one
that
surprised
him
for
she
leaned
towards
him
and
said
in
a
perfectly
new
voice
could
you
get
franz
to
move
you
a
little
more
this
way
one
shout
across
these
acres
of
tablecloth
and
i
heaps
of
things
to
tell
you
he
moved
nearer
and
once
again
he
wronged
betty
by
a
mental
shrinking
was
she
really
going
to
own
that
she
had
resented
the
news
of
his
engagement
she
was
really
hopeless
he
began
to
bristle
defensively
illustration
do
be
cross
she
said
anything
you
care
to
tell
me
will
of
course
be
of
the
greatest
possible
interest
he
was
beginning
but
betty
interrupted
him
do
be
she
said
i
know
i
was
perfectly
horrid
yesterday
but
i
own
i
was
rather
hurt
hold
back
he
adjured
her
inwardly
for
heaven
sake
hold
back
you
see
she
went
on
you
and
i
were
such
good
friends
you
been
so
kind
and
you
told
me
you
talked
to
me
about
things
you
talk
of
to
other
people
and
when
i
thought
you
told
my
a
secret
of
yours
that
you
never
told
me
of
course
i
felt
hurt
anyone
would
have
i
see
said
he
beginning
to
of
course
i
never
dreamed
that
he
lied
and
even
now
i
do
see
then
suddenly
she
did
see
and
crimsoned
again
he
did
lie
said
vernon
carefully
it
was
i
but
i
would
never
have
told
him
anything
that
i
would
have
told
you
nor
half
that
i
did
tell
you
the
waiter
handed
pale
meat
yes
the
scenery
in
brittany
is
most
charming
i
did
some
good
work
there
the
people
are
so
primitive
and
delightful
too
the
waiter
withdrew
and
betty
said
how
do
you
mean
he
did
lie
the
fact
is
said
vernon
he
he
did
not
understand
our
friendship
in
the
least
i
imagine
friendship
was
not
invented
when
he
was
young
it
a
tiresome
subject
miss
desmond
let
drop
it
shall
we
if
you
like
said
she
chilly
as
december
oh
well
then
just
let
me
say
it
was
done
for
your
sake
miss
desmond
he
had
no
idea
that
two
people
should
have
any
interests
in
common
except
except
matters
of
the
heart
and
the
shortest
way
to
convince
him
was
to
tell
him
that
my
heart
was
elsewhere
i
do
like
lies
but
there
are
some
people
who
insist
on
lies
nothing
else
will
convince
them
of
the
truth
here
comes
some
abhorrent
preparation
of
rice
how
goes
it
with
art
i
have
been
working
very
hard
she
said
but
every
day
i
seem
to
know
less
and
less
oh
that
all
right
it
only
that
every
day
one
knows
more
and
more
of
how
little
one
does
know
you
have
to
pass
many
milestones
before
you
pass
out
of
that
state
do
they
always
feed
you
like
this
here
some
days
it
custard
said
betty
but
we
only
been
here
a
week
we
friends
again
now
are
we
he
questioned
suddenly
yes
oh
yes
then
i
may
ask
questions
i
want
to
hear
what
you
been
doing
since
we
parted
and
where
you
been
and
how
you
come
to
paris
and
where
your
aunt
is
and
what
she
say
to
me
when
she
comes
in
she
likes
you
said
betty
and
she
wo
come
in
but
madame
gautier
will
aunt
julia
went
off
this
morning
she
could
delay
any
longer
because
of
catching
the
at
brindisi
and
i
to
wait
here
till
madame
gautier
comes
at
three
auntie
came
all
the
way
back
from
america
to
see
whether
i
was
happy
here
she
a
dear
and
who
is
madame
gautier
is
she
also
a
dear
but
let
have
our
coffee
in
the
salon
and
tell
me
everything
from
the
beginning
yes
said
betty
oh
yes
but
the
salon
window
was
darkened
by
a
passing
shape
my
uncle
bless
him
said
vernon
i
must
go
see
here
my
card
wo
you
write
and
tell
me
all
about
everything
you
will
you
yes
but
you
mus
write
to
me
madame
gautier
opens
all
our
letters
and
friendships
were
invented
when
she
was
young
either
vernon
had
to
go
towards
the
strong
english
voice
that
was
filling
the
hall
with
its
inquiries
for
ung
mossoo
ung
mossoo
anglay
qui
avoir
certainmong
etty
icy
ce
mattan
five
minutes
later
betty
saw
two
figures
go
along
the
pavement
on
the
other
side
of
the
decorous
embroidered
muslin
blinds
which
in
the
unlikely
event
of
any
happening
in
the
cite
de
la
retraite
ensure
its
not
being
distinctly
seen
by
those
who
sojourn
at
the
hotel
bête
betty
instantly
experienced
that
feminine
longing
which
makes
women
write
to
lovers
or
friends
from
whom
they
have
but
now
parted
and
she
was
weaker
than
lady
craye
there
was
nothing
to
do
her
trunks
were
packed
she
had
before
her
two
hours
or
nearly
of
waiting
for
madame
gautier
so
she
wrote
and
this
is
the
letter
erasures
and
all
vernon
when
he
got
it
was
most
interested
in
the
erasures
here
given
in
italics
dear
vernon
i
am
very
glad
we
are
good
friends
again
and
i
should
like
to
tell
you
everything
that
has
happened
you
after
he
when
my
after
the
last
time
i
saw
you
was
very
unhappy
because
i
wanted
to
go
to
i
was
very
anxious
to
go
to
paris
because
of
what
you
had
said
my
aunt
came
down
and
was
very
kind
told
she
persuaded
my
to
let
me
go
i
think
he
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
for
he
never
did
care
about
me
any
more
than
i
did
about
him
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
he
does
not
understand
of
course
i
was
wild
with
joy
and
thought
of
nothing
but
work
and
my
aunt
brought
me
over
but
i
did
not
see
anything
of
paris
then
we
went
straight
on
to
joinville
where
madame
gautier
has
a
villa
and
my
aunt
left
me
there
and
went
to
norway
it
was
all
very
strange
at
first
but
i
liked
it
madame
gautier
is
very
strict
it
was
like
being
at
school
sometimes
i
almost
fancied
that
i
was
at
school
again
there
were
three
other
girls
besides
me
and
we
had
great
fun
the
professor
was
very
nice
and
encouraging
he
is
very
old
so
is
everybody
who
comes
to
the
house
it
is
jolly
because
when
there
are
four
of
you
everything
is
so
interesting
we
used
to
have
picnics
in
the
woods
and
take
it
in
turn
to
ride
in
the
and
there
were
musical
evenings
with
the
pastor
and
the
avocat
and
their
wives
it
was
very
amusing
sometimes
madame
gautier
had
let
her
paris
flat
so
we
stayed
at
joinville
till
a
week
ago
and
then
my
aunt
walked
in
one
day
and
took
me
to
paris
for
a
week
i
did
enjoy
that
and
now
aunt
has
gone
and
madame
gautier
is
taking
the
inventory
and
getting
the
keys
and
presently
she
will
come
for
me
i
shall
go
with
her
to
the
rue
vaugirard
number
it
will
be
very
nice
seeing
the
other
girls
again
and
telling
them
all
about
my
week
in
paris
i
am
so
sorry
that
i
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
but
i
am
glad
we
met
because
i
do
not
like
to
think
my
friends
do
not
trust
me
yours
sincerely
betty
desmond
that
was
the
letter
which
betty
posted
but
the
first
letter
she
wrote
was
quite
different
it
began
you
do
know
you
never
will
know
what
it
is
to
me
to
know
that
you
did
not
deceive
me
my
dear
friend
my
only
friend
and
how
i
treated
you
yesterday
and
how
nobly
you
forgave
me
i
shall
see
you
again
i
must
see
you
again
no
one
else
has
ever
understood
me
and
so
on
to
the
true
and
constant
friend
betty
she
burned
this
letter
the
other
must
go
she
said
that
the
worst
of
life
if
i
sent
the
one
that
really
written
as
i
feel
he
think
i
was
in
love
with
him
or
some
nonsense
but
a
child
who
was
just
in
two
syllables
might
have
written
the
other
so
all
right
she
looked
at
her
watch
the
same
silver
watch
with
which
she
had
once
crossed
the
hand
of
one
who
told
her
fortune
how
silly
all
that
was
she
said
i
have
learned
wisdom
now
nearly
three
i
never
knew
madame
late
before
and
now
betty
began
to
watch
the
windows
for
the
arrival
of
her
chaperone
and
four
came
and
five
but
no
madame
gautier
she
went
out
at
last
and
asked
to
see
the
patronne
and
to
her
she
explained
in
a
french
whose
fluency
its
correctness
that
a
lady
was
to
have
called
for
her
at
three
it
was
now
a
quarter
past
five
what
did
madame
think
she
should
do
madame
was
lethargic
and
uninterested
she
had
no
idea
she
could
not
advise
probably
mademoiselle
would
do
well
to
wait
always
the
concierge
was
less
aloof
but
without
doubt
madame
mademoiselle
friend
had
forgotten
the
hour
she
would
arrive
later
certainly
if
not
mademoiselle
could
stay
the
night
at
the
hotel
where
a
young
lady
would
be
perfectly
well
and
go
to
madame
her
friend
in
the
morning
but
betty
was
not
minded
to
stay
the
night
alone
at
the
hótel
bête
for
one
thing
she
had
very
little
money
save
that
in
the
fat
envelope
addressed
to
madame
gautier
which
her
aunt
had
given
her
it
contained
she
knew
the
money
to
pay
for
her
board
and
lessons
during
the
next
six
months
for
the
elder
miss
desmond
was
off
to
india
japan
and
thibet
and
her
horror
of
banks
and
cheques
made
her
very
downright
in
the
matter
of
money
that
in
the
envelope
was
all
betty
had
and
that
was
madame
gautier
but
the
other
part
of
the
advice
to
go
to
madame
gautier
in
the
morning
if
in
the
morning
why
not
now
she
decided
to
go
now
no
one
opposed
the
idea
much
only
franz
seemed
a
little
disturbed
and
the
concierge
tepidly
urged
patience
but
betty
was
fretted
by
waiting
also
she
knew
that
vernon
and
his
uncle
might
return
at
any
moment
and
it
would
perhaps
be
awkward
for
him
to
find
her
there
she
would
not
for
the
world
cause
him
a
moment
annoyance
besides
he
might
think
she
had
waited
on
the
chance
of
seeing
him
again
that
was
not
to
be
borne
i
will
return
and
take
my
trunks
she
said
and
a
carriage
was
called
there
was
something
very
exhilarating
in
driving
through
the
streets
of
paris
alone
in
a
nice
little
carriage
with
fat
pneumatic
tires
the
street
lamps
were
alight
and
the
shops
not
yet
closed
almost
every
house
seemed
to
be
a
shop
i
wonder
where
all
the
people
live
said
betty
the
place
de
la
concorde
delighted
her
with
its
many
lamps
and
its
splendid
space
how
glorious
it
would
be
to
live
alone
in
paris
she
thought
be
driven
about
in
cabs
just
when
one
liked
and
where
one
liked
oh
i
am
tired
of
being
a
i
suppose
they
wo
let
me
be
grown
up
till
i
so
old
i
shall
wish
i
was
a
again
she
loved
the
river
with
its
reflected
lights
but
it
made
her
shudder
too
of
course
i
shall
never
be
allowed
to
see
the
morgue
she
said
they
wo
let
me
see
anything
real
even
this
little
teeny
tiny
bit
of
a
drive
i
daresay
it
not
comme
il
faut
i
do
hope
madame
be
furious
she
could
expect
me
to
wait
forever
perhaps
too
she
ill
and
no
one
to
look
after
her
oh
i
sure
i
right
to
go
the
doubt
however
grew
as
the
carriage
jolted
through
narrower
streets
and
when
it
drew
up
at
an
open
betty
jumped
out
paid
the
coachman
and
went
in
quite
prepared
to
be
scolded
she
went
through
the
doorway
and
stood
looking
for
the
list
of
names
such
as
are
set
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leading
to
flats
in
london
there
was
no
such
list
from
a
lighted
doorway
on
the
right
came
a
babel
of
shrill
voices
betty
looked
in
at
the
door
and
the
voices
ceased
pardon
madame
said
betty
i
seek
madame
gautier
everyone
in
the
crowded
stuffy
lamplit
little
room
drew
a
deep
breath
mademoiselle
is
without
doubt
one
of
madame
young
ladies
perhaps
it
was
the
sudden
hushing
of
the
raised
voices
perhaps
it
was
something
in
the
flushed
faces
that
all
turned
towards
her
to
her
dying
day
betty
will
never
know
why
she
did
not
say
yes
what
she
did
say
was
i
am
a
friend
of
madame
is
she
at
home
no
mademoiselle
she
is
not
at
home
she
will
never
be
at
home
more
the
poor
lady
she
is
dead
mademoiselle
an
accident
one
of
those
cursed
automobiles
ran
over
her
at
her
very
door
mademoiselle
before
our
eyes
betty
felt
sick
thank
you
she
said
it
is
very
sudden
will
mademoiselle
leave
her
name
the
concierge
asked
curiously
the
brother
of
madame
he
is
in
the
commerce
at
nantes
a
telegramme
has
been
sent
he
arrives
morning
he
will
give
mademoiselle
details
again
betty
said
what
she
had
not
intended
to
say
she
said
miss
brown
perhaps
the
brother
in
the
commerce
vaguely
suggested
the
addition
of
manchester
then
she
turned
away
and
got
out
of
the
light
into
the
friendly
dusk
of
the
street
tiens
but
it
is
droll
said
the
concierge
friend
a
young
girl
and
all
alone
like
that
oh
it
is
nothing
said
the
concierge
the
english
are
mad
all
their
young
girls
run
the
streets
at
all
hours
and
the
devil
guards
them
betty
stood
in
the
street
she
could
not
go
back
to
that
circle
of
harpy
faces
all
eagerly
tearing
to
pieces
the
details
of
poor
old
madame
gautier
death
she
must
be
alone
think
she
would
have
to
write
home
her
father
would
come
to
fetch
her
her
aunt
was
beyond
the
reach
of
appeal
her
would
be
over
everything
would
be
over
she
would
be
dragged
back
to
the
parishing
and
the
meetings
and
the
books
and
the
sunday
school
and
she
would
never
have
lived
in
paris
at
all
she
walked
down
the
street
i
ca
think
i
think
i
have
this
night
to
myself
to
think
in
anyway
i
go
to
some
cheap
hotel
i
have
enough
for
that
she
hailed
a
passing
carriage
drove
to
the
hotel
bête
took
her
luggage
to
the
gare
du
nord
and
left
it
there
then
as
she
stood
on
the
station
step
she
felt
something
in
her
hand
it
was
the
fat
letter
addressed
to
madame
gautier
and
she
knew
it
was
fat
with
bank
notes
she
unfastened
her
dress
and
thrust
the
letter
into
her
bosom
buttoning
the
dress
carefully
over
it
but
i
wo
go
to
my
hotel
yet
she
said
i
wo
even
look
for
one
i
see
paris
a
bit
first
she
hailed
a
coachman
go
she
said
to
some
restaurant
in
the
latin
quarter
where
the
art
students
eat
and
i
alone
in
paris
and
perfectly
free
said
betty
leaning
back
on
the
cushions
no
i
wo
tell
my
coachman
to
drive
along
the
rue
notre
dame
des
champs
wherever
that
is
oh
it
is
glorious
to
be
perfectly
free
oh
poor
madame
gautier
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
held
her
breath
and
wondered
why
she
could
feel
sorry
you
are
a
wretch
she
said
poor
madame
was
kind
to
you
in
her
hard
narrow
way
and
now
is
she
lying
cold
and
dead
all
broken
up
by
that
cruel
motor
car
the
horror
of
the
picture
helped
by
betty
excitement
brought
the
tears
and
she
encouraged
them
it
is
something
to
find
one
is
not
entirely
heartless
she
said
at
last
drying
her
eyes
as
the
carriage
drew
up
at
a
place
where
there
were
people
and
voices
and
many
lights
chapter
x
seeing
life
the
thoughts
of
the
two
who
loved
her
were
with
betty
that
night
the
aunt
shaken
jolted
enduring
much
in
the
paris
lyons
and
mediterranean
express
thought
fondly
of
her
she
a
nice
little
thing
i
must
take
her
about
a
bit
she
mused
and
even
encouraged
her
fancy
to
play
with
the
idea
of
a
london
season
a
thing
it
had
not
done
for
years
the
reverend
cecil
curtains
drawn
and
lamp
alight
paused
to
think
of
her
even
in
the
midst
of
his
first
thorough
examination
of
his
newest
treasure
in
seventeenth
century
tracts
the
man
mouse
baited
and
trapped
for
nibbling
the
margins
of
eugenius
philalethes
being
an
assault
on
henry
moore
it
was
bound
up
with
the
second
wash
or
the
moore
scoured
again
and
a
dozen
others
a
dumpy
octavo
in
brown
leather
he
had
found
it
propping
a
beer
barrel
in
the
next
village
dear
lizzie
i
wonder
if
she
will
ever
care
for
really
important
things
there
must
be
treasures
upon
treasures
in
those
boxes
on
the
french
quays
that
one
reads
about
but
she
never
would
learn
to
know
one
type
from
another
he
studied
the
fire
thoughtfully
i
wonder
if
she
does
understand
how
much
she
is
to
me
he
thought
those
are
the
things
that
are
better
unsaid
at
least
i
always
think
so
when
she
here
but
all
these
months
i
wonder
whether
girls
like
you
to
or
to
leave
them
to
be
understood
it
is
more
delicate
not
to
say
them
perhaps
then
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
other
lizzie
about
whom
he
had
never
felt
these
doubts
he
had
loved
her
and
had
told
her
so
and
she
had
told
him
her
half
of
the
story
in
very
simple
words
and
most
simply
and
without
at
all
leaving
things
to
be
understood
they
had
planned
the
future
that
never
was
to
be
he
remembered
the
day
when
sitting
over
the
fire
and
holding
her
dear
hand
he
had
said
this
is
how
we
shall
sit
when
we
are
old
and
gray
dearest
it
had
seemed
so
impossibly
then
and
she
had
said
i
hope
we
shall
die
the
same
day
cec
but
this
had
not
happened
and
he
had
said
and
we
shall
have
such
a
beautiful
life
doing
good
and
working
for
god
and
bringing
up
our
children
in
the
right
way
oh
lizzie
very
wonderful
to
think
of
that
happiness
is
it
and
she
had
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
whispered
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
little
girl
dear
and
he
had
said
i
shall
call
her
elizabeth
after
my
dear
wife
she
must
have
eyes
like
yours
though
she
will
be
exactly
like
both
of
us
he
had
said
and
they
sat
hand
in
hand
and
talked
innocently
like
two
children
of
the
little
child
that
was
never
to
be
he
had
wanted
them
to
put
on
her
tombstone
lizzie
daughter
of
and
affianced
wife
of
cecil
underwood
but
her
mother
had
said
that
there
was
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
in
his
heart
the
reverend
cecil
had
sometimes
dared
to
hope
that
that
text
had
been
misunderstood
to
him
his
lizzie
had
always
been
as
the
angels
of
god
in
heaven
then
came
the
long
broken
years
and
then
the
little
girl
elizabeth
his
the
love
of
all
his
life
spent
itself
on
her
a
love
so
fond
so
tender
so
sacred
that
it
seemed
only
to
hide
it
a
little
from
the
world
by
a
mask
of
coldness
and
betty
had
never
seen
anything
but
the
mask
i
think
when
i
see
her
i
will
tell
her
all
about
my
lizzie
he
said
i
wonder
if
she
knows
what
the
house
is
like
without
her
but
of
course
she
does
or
she
would
have
asked
to
come
home
long
ago
i
wonder
whether
she
misses
me
very
much
madame
gautier
is
kind
she
says
but
no
stranger
can
make
a
home
as
love
can
make
it
meanwhile
betty
dining
alone
at
a
restaurant
in
the
boulevard
michel
within
a
mile
of
the
serpent
ordered
what
she
called
a
nice
dinner
it
was
mostly
vegetables
and
sweet
things
and
ate
it
with
appetite
looking
about
her
the
long
mirrors
the
waiters
were
like
the
ones
in
london
restaurants
but
the
people
who
ate
there
they
were
different
everything
was
much
shabbier
yet
much
gayer
men
were
dining
with
their
wives
some
of
them
had
a
child
napkin
under
chin
solemnly
struggling
with
a
big
soup
spoon
or
upturning
on
its
little
nose
a
tumbler
of
weak
red
wine
and
water
there
were
students
she
knew
them
by
their
slouched
hats
and
beards
a
day
old
dining
by
twos
and
threes
and
fours
no
one
took
any
more
notice
of
betty
than
was
shewn
by
a
careless
glance
or
two
she
was
very
quietly
dressed
her
hat
even
was
rather
an
unbecoming
brown
thing
when
she
had
eaten
she
ordered
coffee
and
began
to
try
to
think
but
thinking
was
difficult
with
the
loud
voices
and
the
laughter
and
the
clink
of
glasses
and
the
waiters
hurrying
transits
and
at
the
back
of
her
mind
was
a
thought
waiting
for
her
to
think
it
and
she
was
afraid
so
presently
she
paid
her
bill
and
went
out
and
found
a
tram
and
rode
on
the
top
of
it
through
the
lighted
streets
on
the
level
of
the
first
floor
windows
and
the
brown
leaves
of
the
trees
in
the
boulevards
and
went
away
and
away
through
the
heart
of
paris
and
still
all
her
mind
could
do
nothing
but
thrust
off
with
both
hands
the
thought
that
was
pushing
forward
towards
her
thinking
when
the
tram
stopped
at
its
journey
end
she
did
not
alight
but
paid
for
and
made
the
return
journey
and
found
her
feet
again
in
the
boulevard
michel
of
course
she
had
read
her
trilby
and
other
works
dealing
with
the
latin
quarter
she
knew
that
in
that
quarter
everyone
is
not
respectable
but
everyone
is
kind
it
seemed
good
to
her
to
go
to
a
café
to
sit
at
a
marble
topped
table
and
drink
not
the
strange
liqueurs
which
men
drink
in
books
but
homely
hot
milk
such
as
some
of
the
other
girls
there
had
before
them
it
would
be
perfectly
simple
as
well
as
interesting
to
watch
the
faces
of
the
students
boys
and
girls
and
when
she
found
a
nice
to
speak
to
it
asking
for
the
address
of
a
respectable
hotel
so
she
walked
up
the
wide
street
feeling
very
parisian
indeed
as
she
called
it
the
boule
miche
to
herself
and
she
stopped
at
the
first
café
she
came
to
which
happened
to
be
the
café
she
did
not
see
its
name
and
if
she
had
it
would
naturally
not
have
conveyed
any
idea
to
her
the
hour
was
not
yet
ten
and
the
café
was
very
quiet
there
were
not
a
dozen
people
at
the
little
tables
most
of
them
were
women
it
would
be
easy
to
ask
her
little
questions
with
so
few
people
to
stare
and
wonder
if
she
addressed
a
stranger
she
sat
down
and
ordered
her
hot
milk
and
with
a
flutter
awaited
it
this
was
life
and
she
must
telegraph
to
her
and
everything
would
end
in
the
old
round
of
parish
duties
all
her
hopes
and
dreams
would
be
submerged
in
the
heavy
morass
of
meeting
mothers
the
thought
leapt
betty
hid
her
eyes
and
would
not
look
at
it
instead
she
looked
at
the
other
people
seated
at
the
tables
the
women
they
were
laughing
and
talking
among
themselves
one
or
two
looked
at
betty
and
smiled
with
frank
friendliness
betty
smiled
back
but
with
embarrassment
she
had
heard
that
french
ladies
of
rank
and
fashion
would
as
soon
go
out
without
their
stockings
as
without
their
paint
but
she
had
not
supposed
that
the
practice
extended
to
art
students
and
all
these
ladies
were
boldly
painted
no
mere
soupçon
of
carmine
and
pearl
powder
but
good
solid
masterpieces
in
body
colour
black
white
and
red
she
smiled
in
answer
to
their
obvious
friendliness
but
she
did
not
ask
them
for
addresses
a
handsome
scowling
woman
sitting
alone
frowned
at
her
she
felt
quite
hurt
why
should
anyone
want
to
be
unkind
men
selling
flowers
toy
rabbits
rattling
cardboard
balls
offered
their
wares
up
and
down
the
row
of
tables
betty
bought
a
bunch
of
fading
late
roses
and
thought
with
a
sudden
sentimentality
that
shocked
her
of
the
monthly
rose
below
the
window
at
home
it
always
bloomed
well
up
to
christmas
well
in
two
days
she
would
see
that
the
trams
rattled
down
the
boulevard
carriages
rolled
by
every
now
and
then
one
of
these
would
stop
and
a
couple
would
alight
and
people
came
on
foot
the
café
was
filling
up
but
still
none
of
the
women
seemed
to
betty
exactly
the
right
sort
of
person
to
know
exactly
the
right
sort
of
hotel
of
course
she
knew
from
books
that
hotels
keep
open
all
night
but
she
did
not
happen
to
have
read
any
book
which
told
of
the
reluctance
of
respectable
hotels
to
receive
young
women
without
luggage
late
in
the
evening
so
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
plenty
of
time
a
blonde
girl
with
jet
black
brows
and
eyes
like
big
black
beads
was
leaning
her
elbows
on
her
table
and
talking
to
her
companions
two
germans
in
loud
checks
they
kept
glancing
at
betty
and
it
made
her
nervous
to
know
that
they
were
talking
about
her
at
last
her
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
girl
who
smiled
at
her
and
made
a
little
gesture
of
invitation
to
her
to
come
and
sit
at
their
table
betty
out
of
sheer
embarrassment
might
have
gone
but
just
at
that
moment
the
handsome
scowling
woman
rose
rustled
quickly
to
betty
knocking
over
a
chair
in
her
passage
held
out
a
hand
and
said
in
excellent
english
how
do
you
do
betty
gave
her
hand
but
i
do
remember
you
said
she
may
i
join
you
said
the
woman
sitting
down
she
wore
black
and
white
and
red
and
she
was
frightfully
smart
betty
thought
she
glanced
at
the
others
the
tourists
and
the
blonde
they
were
no
longer
looking
at
her
look
here
said
the
woman
speaking
low
i
do
know
you
from
adam
of
course
but
i
know
you
a
decent
girl
for
god
sake
go
home
to
your
friends
i
do
know
what
they
about
to
let
you
out
alone
like
this
i
alone
in
paris
just
now
said
betty
good
god
in
heaven
you
little
fool
get
back
to
your
lodging
no
business
here
i
as
much
business
as
anyone
else
said
betty
i
an
artist
too
and
i
want
to
see
life
you
not
seen
much
yet
said
the
woman
with
a
laugh
that
betty
hated
to
hear
have
you
been
brought
up
in
a
convent
you
an
artist
look
at
all
of
us
do
you
need
to
be
told
what
trade
is
do
said
betty
oh
do
go
home
said
the
woman
and
say
your
prayers
i
suppose
you
say
your
prayers
and
thank
god
that
it
is
your
trade
too
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
betty
well
then
go
home
and
read
your
bible
that
tell
you
the
sort
of
woman
it
is
that
stands
about
the
corners
of
streets
or
sits
at
the
café
what
are
your
people
about
my
father
in
england
said
betty
he
a
clergyman
i
generally
say
mine
was
said
the
other
but
i
wo
to
you
because
you
believe
me
my
father
was
church
organist
though
and
the
vicarage
people
were
rather
fond
of
me
i
used
to
do
a
lot
of
parish
work
she
laughed
again
betty
laid
a
hand
on
the
other
woman
could
you
go
home
to
your
father
or
something
she
asked
feebly
he
cursed
me
forever
put
it
all
down
in
black
and
white
a
regular
commination
service
it
you
that
have
got
to
go
home
and
do
it
too
she
shook
off
betty
hand
and
waved
her
own
to
a
man
who
was
passing
here
temple
the
man
halted
hesitated
and
came
up
to
them
look
here
said
the
woman
look
what
a
pretty
flower
i
found
and
here
of
all
places
she
indicated
betty
by
a
look
the
man
looked
too
and
took
the
third
chair
at
their
table
betty
wished
that
the
ground
might
open
and
cover
her
but
the
boule
miche
asphalt
is
solid
the
was
tall
and
with
a
handsome
serious
boyish
face
and
fair
hair
she
wo
listen
to
me
oh
i
did
betty
put
in
reproachfully
you
talk
to
her
like
a
father
tell
her
where
naughty
little
girls
go
who
stay
out
late
at
the
café
fire
and
brimstone
you
know
she
understand
she
a
clergyman
daughter
i
really
do
think
you
better
go
home
said
the
to
betty
with
gentle
politeness
i
would
directly
said
betty
almost
in
tears
but
the
fact
is
i
have
settled
on
a
hotel
and
i
came
to
this
café
i
thought
i
could
ask
one
of
these
art
students
to
tell
me
a
good
hotel
but
so
how
it
is
i
should
think
not
temple
answered
the
hiatus
then
he
looked
at
the
scowling
woman
and
his
look
was
very
kind
nini
and
her
german
swine
were
beginning
to
be
amiable
said
the
woman
in
an
aside
which
betty
did
not
hear
for
christ
sake
take
the
child
away
and
put
her
safely
for
the
night
somewhere
if
you
have
to
ring
up
a
mother
superior
or
a
governesses
aid
society
right
i
will
he
turned
to
betty
will
you
allow
me
he
said
to
find
a
carriage
for
you
and
see
you
to
a
hotel
thank
you
said
betty
he
went
out
to
the
curbstone
and
scanned
the
road
for
a
passing
carriage
look
here
said
the
woman
turning
suddenly
on
betty
i
daresay
you
think
it
not
my
place
to
speak
oh
if
you
think
so
you
will
some
day
when
you
grown
up
but
look
here
not
chaffing
it
deadly
earnest
you
be
good
see
there
nothing
else
that
any
good
really
yes
said
betty
i
know
if
you
not
good
you
wo
be
happy
there
you
go
the
other
answered
almost
fiercely
it
always
the
way
everyone
says
it
copybooks
and
bible
and
everything
and
no
one
believes
it
till
they
tried
the
other
way
and
then
it
no
use
believing
anything
oh
yes
it
is
said
betty
comfortingly
and
you
so
kind
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
being
kind
being
good
too
it
well
you
are
always
a
devil
even
if
you
are
in
hell
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
all
the
things
i
did
understand
when
i
was
like
you
but
nobody
can
that
part
of
the
hell
and
you
even
understand
half
i
saying
i
think
i
do
said
betty
keep
straight
the
other
said
earnestly
never
mind
how
dull
it
is
i
used
to
think
it
must
be
dull
in
heaven
god
knows
it
dull
in
the
other
place
look
he
got
a
carriage
you
can
trust
him
just
for
once
but
as
a
rule
i
say
you
trust
any
of
them
they
all
of
a
piece
you
a
nice
little
thing
said
betty
oh
you
kind
and
good
people
ca
all
be
good
the
same
way
she
added
vaguely
and
seeking
to
comfort
women
can
said
the
other
do
you
make
any
mistake
she
watched
the
carriage
drive
away
and
turned
to
meet
the
spiteful
chaff
of
nini
and
her
german
friends
now
said
temple
as
soon
as
the
wheels
began
to
revolve
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
how
you
come
to
be
out
in
paris
alone
at
this
hour
betty
stared
at
him
coldly
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
can
recommend
me
a
good
hotel
she
said
i
do
even
know
your
name
said
he
no
she
answered
briefly
i
can
not
advise
you
unless
you
will
trust
me
a
little
he
said
gently
you
are
very
kind
but
i
have
not
yet
asked
for
anyone
advice
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
offended
you
he
said
but
i
only
wish
to
be
of
service
to
you
illustration
she
stared
at
him
coldly
thank
you
very
much
said
betty
the
only
service
i
want
is
the
name
of
a
good
hotel
you
are
unwise
to
refuse
my
help
he
said
the
place
where
i
found
you
shews
that
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
about
alone
look
here
said
betty
speaking
very
fast
i
dare
say
you
mean
well
but
it
is
your
business
the
lady
i
was
speaking
to
that
just
shews
he
said
she
was
very
kind
and
i
like
her
but
i
do
intend
to
be
interfered
with
by
any
strangers
however
well
they
mean
he
laughed
for
the
first
time
and
she
liked
him
better
when
she
had
heard
the
note
of
his
laughter
please
forgive
me
he
said
you
are
quite
right
miss
conway
is
very
kind
and
i
really
do
want
to
help
you
and
i
do
want
to
be
impertinent
may
i
speak
plainly
of
course
well
the
café
is
not
a
place
for
a
respectable
girl
to
go
to
i
gathered
that
she
answered
quietly
i
wo
go
there
again
have
you
quarreled
with
your
friends
he
persisted
have
you
run
away
no
said
betty
and
on
a
sudden
inspiration
added
i
very
very
tired
you
can
ask
me
any
questions
you
like
in
the
morning
now
will
you
please
tell
the
man
where
to
go
the
dismissal
was
unanswerable
he
took
out
his
and
scribbled
on
a
card
where
is
your
luggage
he
asked
not
here
she
said
briefly
i
thought
not
he
smiled
again
i
am
discerning
am
i
not
well
perhaps
you
did
know
that
respectable
hotels
prefer
travellers
who
have
luggage
but
they
know
me
at
this
place
i
have
said
you
are
my
cousin
he
added
apologetically
he
stopped
the
carriage
hôtel
de
he
told
the
driver
and
stood
bareheaded
till
she
was
out
of
sight
the
thought
came
out
and
said
there
will
be
an
end
of
me
if
you
see
that
person
again
betty
would
not
face
the
thought
but
she
was
roused
to
protect
it
she
stood
up
and
touched
the
coachman
on
the
arm
go
back
to
the
cafe
she
said
i
have
forgotten
something
that
was
why
when
temple
called
very
early
at
the
hôtel
de
he
heard
that
his
cousin
had
not
arrived
there
the
night
before
had
not
indeed
arrived
at
all
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
a
pity
he
said
certainly
she
had
run
away
from
home
i
suppose
i
frightened
her
i
was
always
a
clumsy
brute
with
women
chapter
xi
the
thought
the
woman
was
still
ably
answering
the
chaff
of
nini
and
the
germans
and
her
face
was
not
the
face
she
had
shewn
to
betty
betty
came
quietly
behind
her
and
touched
her
shoulder
she
leapt
in
her
chair
and
turned
white
under
the
rouge
what
the
devil
you
should
do
that
she
said
roughly
you
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
i
so
sorry
said
betty
who
was
pale
too
come
away
wo
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you

little
friend

said
one
of
the
men
in
thick
may
i
order
for
her
a
bock
or
a
cerises

she
urged
let

she
said
what
the
matter
where
young
temple
do
tell
me
he
like
all
the
others
he
meant
to
be
kind
said
betty
but

asked
a
lot
of
questions
and
i
do
want
to
know
him

like
you

betty
very
forlornly
but

know
how
tired
i
am
come
with
me
and
then
in
the
morning
we
can
talk
do
do
the
other
woman
took
some
thirty
or
forty
steps
in
silence
then
she
asked
abruptly
have
you
plenty
of
money
yes
lots
and
you
an
artist
yes
at
least
i
a
student
again
the
woman
reflected
at
last
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
laughed
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
she
said
i
shall
make
a
dragon
of
a
chaperon
i
warn
you
yes

just
for
this
one
night
but

betty

it
heart
and
soul
so

the
thing
properly
we
must
have
some
luggage
i
got
an
old
portmanteau
knocking
about
will
you
wait
for
me
somewhere
while
i
get
it
i
rather
not
said
betty
remembering
the
germans
and
nini
well
then
there
be
no
harm
for
a
few
minutes
you
can
come
with
me
this
is
really
rather
a
lark
five
minutes
walking
brought
the
two
to
a
dark
house
the
woman
rang
a
bell
a
latch
clicked
and
a
big
door
swung
open
she
grasped
hand
do
say
a
word
she
said
and
pulled
her
through
it
was
very
dark
the
other
woman
called
out
a
name
as
they
passed
the
door
of
the
concierge
a
name
that
was
not
conway
and
her
hand
pulled
betty
up
flight
after
flight
of
steep
stairs
on
the
fifth
floor
she
opened
a
door
with
a
key
and
left
betty
standing
at
the
threshold
till
she
had
lighted
a
lamp
then
come
in
she
said
and
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
the
room
was
small
and
smelt
of
white
rose
scent
the
had
a
lace
drapery
fastened
up
with
crushed
red
roses
and
there
were
voluminous
lace
and
stuff
curtains
to
bed
and
window
sit
down
said
the
hostess
she
took
off
her
hat
and
pulled
the
scarlet
flowers
from
it
she
washed
her
face
till
it
shewed
no
rouge
and
no
powder
and
the
brown
of
lashes
and
brows
was
free
from
the
black
she
raked
under
the
bed
with
a
faded
sunshade
till
she
found
an
old
brown
portmanteau
her
smart
black
and
white
dress
was
changed
for
a
black
one
of
a
mode
passée
these
three
years
a
gray
chequered
golf
cape
and
the
dulled
hat
completed
the
transformation
how
nice
you
look
said
betty
the
other
bundled
some
linen
and
brushes
into
the
portmanteau
the
poor
old
gladstone
very
thin
still
she
said
and
folded
skirts
we
must
plump
it
out
somehow
when
the
portmanteau
was
filled
and
strapped
they
carried
it
down
between
them
in
the
dark
and
got
it
out
on
to
the
pavement
i
am
miss

said
the
woman
and
we
will
drive
to
the

her
cousin

where
the
rest
of
the
luggage
was
and
gave
orders

the
morning

betty
when

her
hands
and
seemed
to
be
holding
her
courage
between
them
i
come
to
paris
to
study
art
and
i
want
you
to
come
and
live
with
me
i
know
you
like
it
and
i
got
heaps
of
money
will
you
she
spoke
quickly
and
softly
and
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
bright
there
was
a
pause
you
silly
little
duffer
you
silly
dear
little
duffer
the
other
woman
had
turned
away
and
was
fingering
the
chains
of
an
ormolu
candlestick
on
the
mantelpiece
betty
put
an
arm
over
her
shoulders
look
here
she
said
i
not
such
a
duffer
as
you
think
i
know
people
do
dreadful
things
but
they
need
go
on
doing
them
need
they
yes
they
need
said
the
other
that
just
it
her
fingers
were
still
twisting
the
bronze
chains
and
the
women
you
talked
about
in
the
bible
they
were
kind
and
good
like
you
they
were
just
only
horrid
and
not
anything
else
you
told
to
be
good
wo
you
let
me
help
you
oh
it
does
seem
such
cheek
of
me
but
i
never
knew
anyone
before
who
i
do
know
how
to
say
it
but
i
am
so
sorry
and
i
want
you
to
be
good
just
as
much
as
you
want
me
to
dear
dear
lotty
my
name
paula
paula
dear
i
wish
i
was
so
stupid
but
i
know
it
not
your
fault
and
i
know
you
are
like
that
woman
with
the
germans
i
should
hope
not
indeed
paula
was
roused
to
flash
back
dirty
little
french
i
never
been
a
bit
of
good
to
anyone
said
betty
adding
her
other
arm
and
making
a
necklace
of
the
two
round
paula
neck
except
to
parishioners
perhaps
do
let
me
be
a
bit
of
good
to
you
do
you
think
i
could
you
dear
little
fool
said
paula
gruffly
yes
but
say
yes
you
must
i
know
you
want
to
i
got
lots
of
money
kiss
me
paula
i
wo
do
kiss
me
i
wo
have
it
go
away
said
the
woman
clinging
to
betty
and
returning
her
kisses
do
cry
said
betty
gently
we
shall
be
ever
so
happy
see
good
night
paula
do
you
know
i
never
had
a
friend
a
i
mean
for
god
sake
hold
your
tongue
and
go
to
bed
good
night
betty
alone
faced
at
last
and
for
the
first
time
the
thought
but
it
had
changed
its
dress
when
miss
conway
changed
hers
it
was
no
longer
a
thought
it
was
a
resolution
with
her
plan
for
saving
her
new
friend
was
the
plan
for
a
life
that
should
not
be
life
at
long
barton
all
the
evening
she
had
refused
to
face
the
thought
but
it
had
been
shaping
itself
to
something
more
definite
than
thought
as
a
resolution
a
plan
it
now
unrolled
itself
before
her
she
sat
in
the
stiff
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
and
she
saw
what
she
meant
to
do
the
thought
had
been
wise
not
to
insist
too
much
on
recognition
earlier
in
the
evening
it
would
have
seemed
merely
a
selfish
temptation
now
it
was
an
opportunity
for
a
good
and
noble
act
and
betty
had
always
wanted
so
much
to
be
noble
and
good
here
she
was
in
paris
alone
her
aunt
was
every
moment
further
and
further
away
as
for
her
i
hate
him
said
betty
and
he
hates
me
he
only
let
me
come
to
get
rid
of
me
and
what
good
could
i
do
at
long
barton
compared
with
what
i
can
do
here
any
one
can
do
parish
work
i
got
the
money
aunt
left
for
madame
gautier
perhaps
it
stealing
but
is
it
the
money
was
meant
to
pay
to
keep
me
in
paris
to
study
art
and
it
not
as
if
i
were
staying
altogether
for
selfish
reasons
there
paula
i
sure
she
has
really
a
noble
nature
and
it
not
as
if
i
were
staying
because
he
is
in
paris
of
course
that
would
be
but
he
said
he
was
going
to
vienna
i
suppose
his
uncle
delayed
him
but
he
certainly
go
i
sure
it
right
i
learned
a
lot
since
i
left
home
i
not
a
child
now
i
a
woman
and
i
must
do
what
i
think
is
right
you
know
i
must
must
i
she
appealed
to
the
inward
monitor
but
it
refused
to
be
propitiated
it
only
seems
not
quite
right
because
it
so
unusual
she
went
on
that
because
i
never
been
anywhere
or
done
anything
after
all
it
my
own
life
and
i
have
a
right
to
live
it
as
i
like
my
has
never
written
to
madame
gautier
all
these
months
he
wo
now
it
only
to
tell
him
she
has
changed
her
address
he
only
writes
to
me
on
sunday
nights
there
just
time
and
i
keep
the
money
and
when
aunt
comes
back
i
tell
her
everything
understand
do
you
think
so
said
the
inward
monitor
any
way
said
betty
putting
her
foot
down
on
the
inward
monitor
i
going
to
do
it
if
it
only
for
paula
sake
we
take
rooms
and
i
go
to
a
studio
and
work
hard
and
i
wo
make
friends
with
gentlemen
i
do
know
or
anything
silly
so
there
she
added
defiantly
auntie
left
the
money
for
me
to
study
in
paris
if
i
tell
my
that
madame
gautier
is
dead
he
just
fetch
me
home
and
what
become
of
paula
then
thus
and
thus
ringing
the
changes
on
resolve
and
explanation
her
thoughts
ran
a
clock
chimed
midnight
is
it
possible
she
asked
herself
that
it
not
twelve
hours
since
i
was
at
the
hotel
bête
talking
to
him
well
i
shall
never
see
him
again
i
suppose
how
odd
that
i
do
feel
as
if
i
cared
whether
i
did
or
not
i
suppose
what
i
felt
about
him
was
real
it
all
seems
so
silly
now
paula
is
real
and
all
that
i
mean
to
do
for
her
is
real
he
is
she
prayed
that
night
as
usual
but
her
mind
was
made
up
and
she
prayed
outside
a
closed
door
next
morning
when
her
chocolate
came
up
she
carried
it
into
the
next
room
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
new
friend
bed
breakfasted
there
paula
seemed
dazed
when
she
first
woke
but
soon
she
was
smiling
and
listening
to
betty
plans
how
young
you
look
said
betty
almost
as
young
as
me
i
you
do
look
it
with
your
hair
in
those
pretty
plaits
and
your
nightie
you
do
have
lovely
nightgowns
i
get
up
now
said
paula
look
out
i
nearly
upset
the
tray
betty
had
carefully
put
away
certain
facts
and
labelled
them
not
to
be
told
to
anyone
even
paula
no
one
was
to
know
anything
about
vernon
there
is
nothing
to
know
really
she
told
herself
no
one
was
to
know
that
she
was
alone
in
paris
without
the
knowledge
of
her
relations
lots
of
girls
came
to
paris
alone
to
study
art
she
was
just
one
of
these
she
found
the
lying
wonderfully
easy
it
did
not
bring
with
it
either
any
of
the
shame
that
lying
should
bring
but
rather
a
sense
of
triumphant
achievement
as
from
a
difficult
part
played
excellently
she
paid
the
hotel
bill
and
then
the
search
for
rooms
began
we
must
be
very
economical
you
know
she
said
but
you
wo
mind
that
will
you
i
think
it
will
be
rather
fun
it
would
be
awful
fun
said
the
other
you
go
and
work
at
the
studio
and
when
you
come
home
after
your
work
i
shall
have
cooked
the
déjeûner
and
we
shall
have
it
together
on
a
little
table
with
a
nice
white
cloth
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
on
it
yes
and
in
the
evening
we
go
out
to
concerts
and
things
and
ride
on
the
tops
of
trams
and
on
sundays
what
does
one
do
on
sundays
i
suppose
one
goes
to
church
said
paula
oh
i
think
not
when
we
working
so
hard
all
the
week
we
go
into
the
country
we
can
take
the
river
steamer
and
go
to
st
cloud
or
go
out
on
the
tram
to
clamart
the
woods
there
are
just
exactly
like
the
woods
at
home
what
part
of
england
do
you
live
in
kent
said
betty
my
home
in
devonshire
said
paula
it
was
a
hard
day
so
many
stairs
to
climb
so
many
apartments
to
see
and
all
of
them
either
quite
beyond
betty
means
or
else
little
stuffy
places
filled
to
choking
point
with
the
kind
of
furniture
no
one
could
bear
to
live
with
and
with
no
light
and
no
outlook
except
a
blank
wall
a
yard
or
two
from
the
window
they
kept
to
the
montparnasse
quarter
for
there
paula
said
were
the
best
ateliers
for
betty
they
found
a
little
restaurant
where
only
art
students
ate
and
where
one
could
breakfast
royally
for
about
a
shilling
betty
looked
with
interest
at
the
faces
of
the
students
and
wondered
whether
she
should
ever
know
any
of
them
some
of
them
looked
interesting
a
few
were
english
and
fully
half
american
then
the
weary
hunt
for
rooms
began
again
it
was
five
before
a
unexpected
in
face
of
their
refusal
of
her
rooms
asked
whether
they
had
tried
madame
bianchi
madame
bianchi
where
the
atelier
was
and
the
meetings
on
sunday
evenings
number
boulevard
montparnasse
they
tried
it
one
passes
through
an
archway
into
a
yard
where
the
machinery
of
a
great
laundry
pulses
half
the
week
up
some
wide
wooden
stairs
shallow
easy
stairs
and
on
the
first
floor
are
the
two
rooms
betty
drew
a
long
breath
when
she
saw
them
they
were
lofty
they
were
airy
they
were
light
there
was
not
much
furniture
but
what
there
was
was
good
old
carved
armoires
solid
divans
and
joy
of
joys
in
each
room
a
carved
oak
seventeenth
century
mantelpiece
eight
feet
high
and
four
feet
deep
i
have
these
rooms
betty
whispered
oh
i
could
make
them
so
pretty
the
rent
of
the
rooms
was
almost
twice
as
much
as
the
sum
they
fixed
on
and
paula
murmured
caution
its
no
use
said
betty
we
live
on
bread
and
water
if
you
like
but
we
live
on
it
and
she
took
the
rooms
i
sure
we
done
right
she
said
as
they
drove
off
to
fetch
her
boxes
the
rooms
will
be
like
a
home
you
see
if
they
are
and
there
a
piano
too
and
madame
bianchi
is
she
a
darling
she
pretty
and
sweet
and
nice
yes
said
paula
thoughtfully
it
certainly
is
something
that
got
rooms
in
the
house
of
a
woman
like
that
and
that
ducky
little
kitchen
oh
we
shall
have
such
fun
cooking
our
own
meals
you
shall
get
the
déjeûner
but
i
cook
the
dinner
while
you
lie
on
the
sofa
and
read
novels
a
real
lady
do
use
that
expression
i
hate
it
said
paula
sharply
but
the
rooms
are
lovely
are
they
yes
it
a
good
place
for
you
to
be
in
i
sure
of
that
said
the
other
musing
again
when
the
boxes
were
unpacked
and
betty
had
pinned
up
a
few
prints
and
photographs
and
sketches
and
arranged
some
bright
coloured
liberty
scarves
to
cover
the
walls
more
obvious
defects
left
by
the
removal
of
the
last
tenant
decorations
when
flowers
were
on
table
and
piano
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
lamps
lighted
the
room
did
indeed
look
like
a
home
we
have
dinner
out
said
paula
and
we
go
marketing
and
find
you
a
studio
to
work
at
why
not
here
that
an
idea
have
you
a
lace
collar
you
can
lend
me
this
is
not
fit
to
be
seen
betty
pinned
the
collar
on
her
friend
i
believe
you
get
prettier
every
minute
she
said
i
must
just
write
home
and
give
them
my
address
she
fetched
her
embroidered
it
reminds
one
of
bazaars
said
miss
conway
boulevard
montparnasse
my
dear
father
this
is
our
new
address
madame
gautier
tenant
wanted
to
keep
on
her
flat
in
the
rue
de
vaugirard
so
she
has
taken
this
one
which
is
larger
and
very
convenient
as
it
is
close
to
many
of
the
best
studios
i
think
i
shall
like
it
very
much
it
is
not
decided
yet
where
i
am
to
study
but
there
is
an
atelier
in
the
house
for
ladies
only
and
i
think
it
will
be
there
so
that
i
shall
not
have
to
go
out
to
my
lessons
i
will
write
again
as
soon
as
we
are
more
settled
we
only
moved
in
late
this
afternoon
so
there
is
a
lot
to
do
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
and
that
everything
is
going
on
well
in
the
parish
i
will
certainly
send
some
sketches
for
the
christmas
sale
madame
gautier
does
not
wish
me
to
go
home
for
christmas
she
thinks
it
would
interrupt
my
work
too
much
there
is
a
new
girl
a
miss
conway
i
like
her
very
much
with
love
yours
affectionately
desmond
she
was
glad
when
that
letter
was
written
it
is
harder
to
lie
in
writing
than
in
speech
and
the
use
of
the
dead
woman
name
made
her
shiver
but
i
wo
do
things
by
halves
she
said
what
this
paula
asked
sharply
she
had
stopped
in
front
of
one
of
betty
water
colours
that
oh
i
did
it
ages
ago
before
i
learned
anything
do
look
at
it
but
is
it
oh
only
our
house
at
home
i
wonder
said
paula
why
all
english
vicarages
are
exactly
alike
it
a
rectory
said
betty
absently
that
ought
to
make
a
difference
but
it
does
i
have
seen
an
english
garden
for
four
years
four
years
is
a
long
time
said
betty
you
do
know
how
long
said
the
other
and
the
garden
been
going
on
just
the
same
all
the
time
it
seems
odd
does
it
those
hollyhocks
the
ones
at
the
vicarage
at
home
are
just
like
them
come
let
go
to
dinner
chapter
xii
the
rescue
when
vernon
had
read
betty
letter
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
he
was
able
to
read
the
words
almost
as
easily
as
the
others
he
decided
that
he
might
as
well
know
where
she
worked
and
one
day
after
he
had
called
on
lady
craye
he
found
himself
walking
along
the
rue
de
vaugirard
lady
craye
was
charming
and
she
had
been
quite
right
when
she
had
said
that
he
would
find
a
special
charm
in
the
companionship
of
one
in
whose
heart
his
past
seemed
to
have
planted
no
thorns
yet
her
charm
by
its
very
nature
its
finished
elegance
its
conscious
authority
made
him
think
with
the
more
interest
of
the
unformed
immature
grace
of
the
other
woman
betty
in
whose
heart
he
had
not
had
the
chance
to
plant
either
thorns
or
roses
how
could
he
find
out
concierges
are
venal
but
vernon
disliked
base
instruments
he
would
act
boldly
it
was
always
the
best
way
he
would
ask
to
see
this
madame
gautier
if
betty
were
present
he
must
take
his
chance
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
whether
she
would
commit
herself
to
his
plot
by
not
recognizing
him
if
she
did
that
yet
he
hoped
she
would
if
she
did
recognize
him
he
would
say
that
it
was
through
miss
desmond
relatives
that
he
had
heard
of
madame
gautier
betty
could
not
contradict
him
he
would
invent
a
niece
whose
parents
wished
to
place
her
with
madame
then
he
could
ask
as
many
questions
as
he
liked
about
hours
and
studios
and
all
the
details
of
the
life
betty
led
it
was
a
simple
design
and
one
that
carried
success
in
its
pocket
no
one
could
suspect
anything
yet
at
the
very
first
step
suspicion
or
what
looked
like
it
stared
at
him
from
the
eyes
of
the
concierge
when
he
asked
for
madame
gautier
monsieur
is
not
of
the
friends
of
madame
she
asked
curiously
he
knew
better
than
to
resent
the
curiosity
he
explained
that
he
desired
to
see
madame
on
business
you
will
see
her
never
the
woman
said
dramatically
she
sees
no
one
any
more
is
it
that
she
is
ill
it
is
that
she
is
dead
and
the
dead
do
not
receive
monsieur
she
laughed
and
told
the
tale
of
death
circumstantially
with
grim
relish
of
detail
and
the
young
ladies
they
have
returned
to
their
parents
ah
it
is
in
the
young
ladies
that
monsieur
interests
himself
but
yes
madame
brother
who
is
in
the
commerce
of
nantes
he
restored
instantly
the
young
ladies
to
their
friends
one
was
already
with
her
aunt
vernon
had
money
ready
in
his
hand
what
was
her
name
madame
the
young
lady
with
the
aunt
but
i
know
not
monsieur
she
was
a
new
young
lady
who
had
been
with
madame
at
her
villa
i
have
not
seen
her
at
the
time
of
the
regrettable
accident
she
was
with
her
aunt
and
doubtless
remains
there
thank
you
monsieur
that
is
all
i
know
thank
you
madame
i
am
desolated
to
have
disturbed
you
good
day
and
vernon
was
in
the
street
again
so
betty
had
never
come
to
the
rue
vaugirard
the
aunt
must
somehow
have
heard
the
news
perhaps
she
had
called
on
the
way
to
the
train
she
had
returned
to
the
bête
and
betty
now
was
heaven
alone
knew
where
perhaps
at
long
barton
perhaps
in
paris
with
some
other
dragon
vernon
for
a
day
or
two
made
a
point
of
being
near
when
the
studios
julien
carlorossi
delacluse
disgorged
their
students
he
did
not
see
betty
because
she
was
not
studying
at
any
of
these
places
but
at
the
atelier
bianchi
of
which
he
never
thought
so
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
dined
again
with
lady
craye
and
began
to
have
leisure
to
analyse
the
emotions
with
which
she
inspired
him
he
had
not
believed
that
he
could
be
so
attracted
by
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
played
the
entire
comedy
from
first
glance
to
last
tear
from
meeting
hands
to
severed
hearts
yet
attracted
he
was
and
strongly
he
experienced
a
sort
of
resentment
a
feeling
that
she
had
kept
something
from
him
that
she
had
reserves
of
which
he
knew
nothing
that
he
who
in
his
blind
complacency
had
imagined
himself
to
have
sucked
the
orange
and
thrown
away
the
skin
had
really
in
point
of
fact
had
a
strange
lovely
fruit
snatched
from
him
before
his
blunt
teeth
had
done
more
than
nibble
at
its
seemingly
commonplace
rind
in
the
old
days
she
had
reared
barriers
of
reserve
walls
of
reticence
over
which
he
could
see
so
easily
now
she
posed
as
having
no
reserves
and
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
following
her
through
a
darkling
wood
where
the
branches
flew
back
and
hit
him
in
the
face
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
path
you
know
she
said
what
makes
it
so
delightful
to
talk
to
you
is
that
i
can
say
exactly
what
i
like
you
wo
expect
me
to
be
clever
or
shy
or
any
of
those
tiresome
things
we
can
be
perfectly
frank
with
each
other
and
that
such
a
relief
is
it
i
wonder
whether
it
would
be
supposing
it
could
be
said
he
they
were
driving
in
the
bois
among
the
autumn
tinted
trees
where
the
pale
mist
wreaths
wandered
like
ghosts
in
the
late
afternoon
of
course
it
could
be
it
is
she
said
opening
her
eyes
at
him
under
the
brim
of
her
marvel
of
a
hat
at
least
it
is
for
simple
folk
like
me
why
do
you
wear
a
window
in
your
breast
as
i
do
she
laid
her
perfectly
gloved
hand
on
her
sables
is
there
really
a
window
can
one
see
into
your
heart
can
not
the
rest
just
the
one
from
whom
one
feareth
nothing
expecteth
nothing
hopeth
nothing
that
out
of
the
bible
is
it
it
near
enough
said
he
of
course
to
you
it
a
new
sensation
to
have
the
window
in
your
breast
whereas
i
from
innocent
childhood
to
earnest
manhood
have
ever
been
open
as
the
day
yes
she
said
you
were
always
transparent
enough
but
one
is
so
blind
when
one
is
in
love
her
calm
references
to
the
past
always
piqued
him
i
do
think
love
is
so
blind
as
he
painted
he
said
always
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
be
in
love
with
people
i
begin
to
see
their
faults
you
may
be
transparent
but
you
have
a
good
mirror
she
laughed
you
do
see
yourself
as
you
are
it
is
when
you
begin
to
love
people
that
you
see
their
faults
is
it
it
really
when
they
begin
to
love
you
but
i
never
begin
to
love
people
till
they
begin
to
love
me
i
too
modest
and
i
never
love
people
after
they
done
loving
me
i
too
too
what
too
something
forgetful
is
it
i
mean
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
and
it
certainly
takes
two
to
make
a
love
affair
and
what
about
all
the
broken
hearts
what
broken
hearts
the
ones
you
find
in
the
poets
and
the
story
books
that
just
where
you
do
find
them
nowhere
now
honestly
has
your
heart
ever
been
broken
not
yet
so
be
careful
how
you
play
with
it
you
do
often
find
such
a
perfect
specimen
absolutely
not
a
crack
or
a
chip
the
pitcher
should
crow
too
loud
can
pitchers
crow
they
have
ears
of
course
but
only
the
little
pitchers
the
ones
that
go
to
the
well
should
go
in
modest
silence
dear
lady
he
said
almost
impatiently
what
is
there
about
me
that
drives
my
friends
to
stick
up
danger
boards
all
along
my
path
way
to
destruction
you
all
label
them
i
am
always
being
solemnly
warned
that
i
shall
get
my
heart
broken
one
of
these
days
if
i
look
out
i
wish
you
would
call
me
dear
lady
she
said
it
not
the
mode
any
more
now
what
may
i
call
you
he
had
to
ask
turning
to
look
in
her
eyes
you
need
call
me
anything
i
hate
being
called
names
that
a
pretty
girl
not
the
dark
one
the
one
with
the
fur
hat
he
turned
to
look
two
girls
were
walking
briskly
under
the
falling
leaves
and
the
one
with
the
fur
hat
was
betty
but
it
was
at
the
other
that
he
gazed
even
as
he
returned
betty
prim
little
bow
he
even
turned
a
little
as
the
carriage
passed
to
look
more
intently
at
the
tall
figure
in
shabby
black
whose
arm
betty
held
well
said
lady
craye
breaking
the
silence
that
followed
well
said
he
rousing
himself
but
too
late
you
were
saying
i
might
call
you
it
not
what
i
was
saying
it
what
you
were
looking
who
is
the
girl
and
why
do
you
approve
of
her
companion
who
says
i
do
wear
a
window
in
my
breast
he
laughed
the
a
little
country
girl
i
knew
in
england
i
did
know
she
was
in
paris
and
i
thought
i
knew
the
woman
too
but
that
impossible
it
only
a
likeness
one
nice
thing
about
me
is
that
i
never
ask
impertinent
questions
or
hardly
ever
that
one
slipped
out
and
i
withdraw
it
i
do
want
to
know
anything
about
anything
and
i
sorry
i
spoke
i
see
of
course
that
she
is
a
little
country
girl
you
knew
in
england
and
that
you
are
not
at
all
interested
in
her
how
fast
the
leaves
fall
now
they
no
question
of
your
could
be
im
could
be
anything
but
flattering
but
since
you
interested
not
at
all
she
said
politely
oh
but
do
be
interested
he
urged
intent
on
checking
her
inconvenient
interest
because
really
it
is
rather
interesting
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
i
was
painting
my
big
picture
i
wish
come
and
see
it
by
the
way
will
you
some
day
and
have
tea
in
my
studio
i
should
love
it
when
shall
i
come
whenever
you
will
he
wished
she
would
ask
another
question
about
betty
but
she
would
he
had
to
go
on
a
little
awkwardly
well
i
only
knew
them
for
a
week
her
and
her
aunt
and
her
father
and
she
a
nice
quiet
little
thing
the
father
a
parson
all
of
them
are
all
that
there
is
of
most
respectable
she
listened
but
she
did
not
speak
and
i
was
rather
surprised
to
see
her
here
and
for
the
moment
i
thought
the
woman
with
her
was
well
the
last
kind
of
woman
who
could
have
been
with
her
do
you
know
i
see
said
lady
craye
well
it
fortunate
that
the
dark
woman
is
that
kind
of
woman
no
doubt
you
be
seeing
your
little
friend
you
might
ask
her
to
tea
when
i
come
to
see
your
picture
i
wish
i
could
vernon
manner
was
never
so
frank
as
when
he
was
most
on
his
guard
she
love
to
know
you
i
wish
i
could
ask
them
to
tea
but
i
do
know
them
well
enough
and
their
address
i
do
know
at
all
it
a
pity
she
a
nice
little
thing
it
was
beautifully
done
lady
craye
inwardly
applauded
acting
and
none
the
less
that
her
own
part
had
grown
strangely
difficult
she
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
longing
to
be
alone
to
let
her
face
go
she
gave
herself
a
moment
pause
caught
at
her
fine
courage
and
said
yes
it
is
a
pity
however
i
daresay
it
safer
for
her
that
you
ca
ask
her
to
tea
she
a
nice
little
thing
and
she
might
fall
in
love
with
you
and
then
your
modesty
appeased
you
might
follow
suit
is
it
annoying
when
one
ca
pick
up
the
thread
of
a
conversation
all
the
time
you
been
talking
i
been
wondering
what
we
were
talking
about
before
i
pointed
out
the
fur
hat
to
you
and
i
nearly
remember
and
i
ca
quite
that
is
always
so
worrying
is
it
her
acting
was
as
good
as
his
and
his
perception
at
the
moment
less
clear
than
hers
he
gave
a
breath
of
relief
it
would
never
have
done
to
have
lady
craye
spying
on
him
and
betty
and
now
he
knew
that
she
was
in
paris
he
knew
too
that
it
would
be
him
and
betty
we
were
talking
he
said
carefully
about
calling
names
oh
thank
you
when
one
ca
remember
those
silly
little
things
it
like
wanting
to
sneeze
and
not
being
able
to
is
it
but
we
must
turn
back
or
i
shall
be
late
for
dinner
and
i
dare
think
of
the
names
my
hostess
will
call
me
then
she
has
a
vocabulary
you
know
she
named
a
name
and
vernon
thought
it
was
he
who
kept
the
talk
busy
among
acquaintances
till
the
moment
for
parting
lady
craye
knew
that
it
was
she
the
moment
betty
had
bowed
to
vernon
she
turned
her
head
in
answer
to
the
pressure
on
her
arm
who
that
her
friend
asked
betty
named
him
and
in
a
voice
genuinely
unconcerned
how
long
have
you
known
him
i
knew
him
for
a
week
last
spring
he
gave
me
a
few
lessons
he
is
a
great
favourite
of
my
aunt
but
we
do
know
him
much
and
i
thought
he
was
in
vienna
does
he
know
where
you
are
no
then
mind
he
does
why
because
when
girls
are
living
alone
they
ca
be
too
careful
remember
you
the
person
that
responsible
for
betty
desmond
now
you
have
your
aunt
and
your
father
to
take
care
of
you
i
got
you
said
betty
affectionately
yes
you
got
me
said
her
friend
life
in
the
new
rooms
was
going
very
easily
and
pleasantly
betty
had
covered
some
cushions
with
the
soft
green
silk
of
an
old
evening
dress
aunt
julia
had
given
her
she
had
bought
chrysanthemums
in
pots
and
now
all
her
little
belongings
the
same
that
had
given
the
to
her
boudoir
bedroom
at
home
lay
about
and
here
in
this
foreign
setting
did
really
stamp
the
room
with
a
pretty
delicate
conventional
individuality
the
embroidered
the
silver
the
wicker
lined
with
blue
satin
the
long
worked
stuck
with
betty
sparkling
all
these
commonplace
at
long
barton
were
here
not
commonplace
there
was
nothing
of
paula
lying
about
she
had
brought
nothing
with
her
and
had
fetched
nothing
from
her
room
save
clothes
dresses
and
hats
of
the
plainest
the
experiments
in
cooking
were
amusing
so
were
the
marketings
in
odd
little
shops
that
sold
what
one
wanted
and
a
great
many
things
that
one
had
never
heard
of
the
round
of
concerts
and
theatres
and
had
not
begun
yet
in
the
evenings
betty
drew
while
paula
read
aloud
from
the
library
of
stray
tauchnitz
books
betty
had
gleaned
from
foreign
it
was
a
very
busy
pleasant
and
the
studio
life
did
not
lack
interest
betty
suffered
a
martyrdom
of
nervousness
when
first
a
little
late
she
entered
the
atelier
it
is
a
large
light
room
a
alcove
at
one
end
hung
with
drapery
holds
a
grand
piano
all
along
one
side
are
big
windows
that
give
on
an
old
garden
once
a
convent
garden
where
nuns
used
to
walk
telling
their
beads
the
walls
are
covered
with
sketches
posters
studies
betty
looked
nervously
round
the
scene
was
agitatingly
unfamiliar
the
strange
faces
the
girls
in
painting
pinafores
the
little
forest
of
easels
and
on
the
square
wooden
platform
the
model
smooth
brown
with
limbs
set
moveless
as
a
figure
of
wax
betty
got
to
work
as
soon
as
she
knew
how
one
began
to
get
to
work
it
was
her
first
attempt
at
a
drawing
from
the
life
saving
certain
not
unsuccessful
caricatures
of
her
fellow
pupils
her
professor
and
her
chaperon
so
far
she
had
only
been
set
to
do
landscape
and
laborious
drawings
of
casts
from
the
antique
the
work
was
much
harder
than
she
had
expected
and
the
heat
was
overpowering
she
wondered
how
these
other
girls
could
stand
it
their
amused
glances
made
her
furious
she
rubbed
out
most
of
the
lines
she
had
put
in
and
gasped
for
breath
the
room
the
students
the
naked
brown
girl
on
the
model
throne
all
swam
before
her
eyes
she
got
to
the
door
somehow
opened
and
shut
it
and
found
herself
sitting
on
the
top
stair
with
closed
eyelids
and
heart
beating
heavily
illustration
betty
looked
nervously
around
the
scene
was
agitatingly
unfamiliar
some
one
held
water
to
her
lips
she
was
being
fanned
with
a
handkerchief
i
all
right
she
said
yes
it
hotter
than
usual
said
the
fanning
vigorously
why
do
they
have
it
so
hot
asked
poor
betty
because
of
the
model
of
course
poor
thing
she
has
got
a
nice
blue
gown
and
a
pinafore
to
keep
her
warm
we
have
to
try
to
match
the
garden
of
eden
climate
when
we
drawing
from
a
girl
who
only
allowed
to
use
eve
fashion
plates
betty
laughed
and
opened
her
eyes
how
jolly
of
you
to
come
out
after
me
she
said
oh
i
was
just
the
same
at
first
all
right
now
i
ought
to
get
back
you
just
sit
here
till
you
feel
fit
again
so
long
so
betty
sat
there
on
the
bare
wide
brown
stair
staring
at
the
window
till
things
had
steadied
themselves
and
then
she
went
back
to
her
work
her
easel
was
there
and
her
out
drawing
no
that
was
not
her
drawing
it
was
a
head
vaguely
but
very
competently
sketched
a
likeness
no
a
caricature
of
betty
herself
she
looked
round
one
quick
but
quite
sufficient
look
the
girl
next
her
and
the
one
to
that
girl
right
were
exchanging
glances
and
the
exchange
ceased
just
too
late
betty
saw
from
then
till
the
rest
betty
did
not
look
at
the
model
she
looked
but
furtively
at
those
two
girls
when
at
the
the
model
stretched
and
yawned
and
got
off
her
throne
and
into
a
striped
petticoat
most
of
the
students
took
their
easy
on
the
stairs
among
these
the
two
betty
who
never
lacked
courage
took
charcoal
in
hand
and
advanced
quite
boldly
to
the
easel
next
to
her
own
how
she
envied
the
quality
of
the
drawing
she
saw
there
but
envy
does
not
teach
mercy
the
little
sketch
that
betty
left
on
the
corner
of
the
drawing
was
quite
as
faithful
and
far
more
cruel
than
the
one
on
her
own
paper
then
she
went
on
to
the
next
easel
the
few
students
who
were
chatting
to
the
model
looked
curiously
at
her
and
giggled
among
themselves
when
the
rest
was
over
and
the
model
had
reassumed
quite
easily
and
certainly
that
pose
of
the
uplifted
arms
which
looked
so
difficult
the
students
trooped
back
and
the
two
girls
betty
enemies
as
she
bitterly
felt
returned
to
their
easels
they
looked
at
their
drawings
they
looked
at
each
other
and
they
looked
at
betty
and
when
they
looked
at
her
they
smiled
well
done
the
girl
next
her
said
softly
for
a
tenderfoot
you
hit
back
fairly
straight
i
guess
you
do
you
very
kind
said
betty
haughtily
do
you
get
your
quills
up
said
the
girl
i
hit
first
but
you
hit
hardest
i
do
know
you
but
i
want
to
she
smiled
so
queer
yet
friendly
a
smile
that
betty
haughtiness
had
to
dissolve
in
an
answering
smile
my
name
betty
desmond
she
said
i
wonder
why
you
wanted
to
hit
a
man
when
he
was
down
my
said
the
girl
how
was
i
to
surmise
about
you
being
down
you
looked
dandy
enough
fit
to
lick
all
creation
i
never
been
in
a
studio
before
said
betty
fixing
fresh
paper
my
said
the
girl
again
turn
the
faucet
off
now
the
model
like
us
to
whisper
ca
stand
the
draught
so
betty
was
silent
working
busily
but
next
day
she
was
greeted
with
friendly
nods
and
she
had
some
one
to
speak
to
in
the
on
the
third
day
she
was
asked
to
a
studio
party
by
the
girl
who
had
fanned
her
on
the
stairs
and
bring
your
friend
with
you
she
said
but
betty
friend
had
a
headache
that
day
betty
went
alone
and
came
home
full
of
the
party
she
got
such
a
jolly
studio
she
said
ever
so
high
up
and
busts
and
casts
and
things
everyone
was
so
nice
to
me
you
think
it
was
just
like
what
one
hears
of
girton
cocoa
parties
we
had
tea
such
weak
tea
paula
it
could
hardly
crawl
out
of
the
teapot
we
had
it
out
of
green
basins
and
the
loveliest
cakes
there
were
only
two
chairs
so
some
of
us
sat
on
the
sommier
and
the
rest
on
the
floor
were
there
any
young
men
asked
paula
two
or
three
very
very
young
ones
they
came
late
but
they
might
as
well
have
been
girls
there
was
any
flirting
or
nonsense
of
that
sort
paula
do
you
think
might
give
a
party
not
now
but
presently
when
we
know
some
more
people
do
you
think
they
like
it
or
would
they
think
it
a
bore
they
love
it
i
should
think
paula
looked
round
the
room
which
already
she
loved
and
what
did
you
all
talk
about
work
said
betty
work
and
work
and
work
and
work
and
work
everyone
talked
about
their
work
and
everyone
else
listened
and
watched
for
the
chance
to
begin
to
talk
about
theirs
this
is
real
life
my
dear
i
am
so
glad
i
beginning
to
know
people
miss
voscoe
is
very
queer
but
she
a
dear
she
the
one
who
caricatured
me
the
first
day
oh
we
shall
do
now
sha
we
yes
said
the
other
you
do
now
i
said
betty
corrected
softly
i
meant
we
of
course
said

chapter
xiii
contrasts
vernon
idea
of
a
studio
was
a
place
to
work
in
a
place
where
there
should
be
room
for
all
the
tools
of
one
trade
and
besides
a
great
space
to
walk
up
and
down
in
those
moods
that
seize
on
all
artists
when
their
work
will
not
come
as
they
want
it
but
when
he
gave
he
had
store
of
draperies
to
pull
out
from
his
carved
cupboard
deeply
coloured
things
embroidered
in
rich
silk
and
heavy
gold
chinese
burmese
japanese
russian
he
came
in
with
an
armful
of
fair
chrysanthemums
deftly
set
them
in
tall
brazen
jars
pulled
out
his
draperies
and
arranged
them
swiftly
there
was
a
screen
to
be
hung
with
a
chinese
dress
where
on
black
gold
dragons
writhed
squarely
among
blue
roses
the
couch
was
covered
by
a
red
burnous
with
a
gold
border
there
were
persian
praying
mats
to
lay
on
the
bare
floor
kakemonos
to
be
fastened
with
drawing
pins
on
the
bare
walls
a
tea
cloth
worked
by
russian
peasants
lay
under
the
two
only
of
yellow
chinese
ware
his
and
were
queen
anne
silver
heirlooms
at
which
he
mocked
but
he
saw
to
it
that
they
were
kept
bright
he
lighted
the
she
was
always
confoundedly
punctual
he
said
but
lady
craye
was
not
punctual
she
arrived
half
an
hour
late
and
the
delay
had
given
her
host
time
to
think
about
her
he
heard
her
voice
in
the
courtyard
at
last
but
the
only
window
that
looked
that
way
was
set
high
in
the
wall
of
the
little
corridor
and
he
could
not
see
who
it
was
to
whom
she
was
talking
and
he
wondered
because
the
inflection
of
her
voice
was
english
not
the
exquisite
imitation
of
the
french
inflexion
which
he
had
so
often
admired
in
her
he
opened
the
door
and
went
to
the
stair
head
the
voices
were
coming
up
the
steps
a
caller
said
vernon
and
added
a
word
or
two
however
little
you
may
be
in
love
with
a
woman
two
is
better
company
than
three
the
voices
came
up
he
saw
the
golden
brown
shimmer
of
lady
craye
hat
and
knew
that
it
matched
her
hair
and
that
there
would
be
violets
somewhere
under
the
brim
of
it
violets
that
would
make
her
eyes
look
violet
too
she
was
coming
up
a
man
just
behind
her
she
came
round
the
last
turn
and
the
man
was
temple
what
an
alpine
ascent
she
exclaimed
reaching
up
her
hand
so
that
vernon
drew
her
up
the
last
three
steps
we
have
been
hunting
you
together
on
both
the
other
staircases
now
that
the
chase
is
ended
wo
you
present
your
friend
and
i
bow
to
him
as
soon
as
i
on
firm
ground
vernon
made
the
presentation
and
held
the
door
open
for
lady
craye
to
pass
as
she
did
so
temple
behind
her
raised
eyebrows
which
said
am
i
inconvenient
shall
i
borrow
a
book
or
something
and
go
vernon
shook
his
head
it
was
annoying
but
inevitable
he
could
only
hope
that
lady
craye
also
was
disappointed
how
punctual
you
are
he
said
sit
here
wo
you
i
finished
laying
the
table
he
deliberately
brought
out
four
more
cups
what
unnatural
penetration
you
have
temple
how
did
you
find
out
that
this
is
the
day
when
i
sit
home
and
wait
for
people
to
come
and
buy
my
pictures
and
no
one
come
lady
craye
had
sunk
into
the
chair
and
was
pulling
off
her
gloves
that
very
disappointing
i
thought
i
should
meet
dozens
of
clever
and
interesting
people
and
i
only
meet
two
her
brilliant
smile
made
the
words
seem
neither
banal
nor
impertinent
vernon
was
pleased
to
note
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
was
disappointed
you
are
too
kind
he
said
gravely
temple
was
looking
around
the
room
jolly
place
you
got
here
he
said
but
it
hard
to
find
i
should
have
gone
off
in
despair
if
i
had
met
lady
st
craye
we
kept
each
other
courage
up
did
we
temple
it
was
like
arctic
explorers
i
was
beginning
to
think
we
should
have
to
make
a
camp
and
cook
my
muff
for
tea
she
held
out
the
sable
and
vernon
laid
it
on
the
couch
when
he
had
held
it
to
his
face
for
a
moment
i
love
the
touch
of
fur
he
said
and
your
fur
is
scented
with
the
scent
of
summer
gardens
jasmine
muffled
lattices
he
quoted
softly
temple
had
wandered
to
the
window
what
ripping
roofs
he
said
can
one
get
out
on
them
now
what
demanded
vernon
the
hidden
mainspring
that
impels
every
man
who
comes
into
these
rooms
to
ask
instantly
whether
one
can
get
out
on
to
the
roof
it
only
englishmen
by
the
way
americans
never
ask
it
nor
frenchmen
it
the
exploring
spirit
i
suppose
said
temple
idly
the
spirit
that
has
made
england
the
empire
which
et
cetera
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
yes
but
i
think
the
sunset
would
be
one
of
the
attractions
of
your
roof
mr
vernon
sunset
is
never
attractive
to
me
said
he
nor
autumn
give
me
sunrise
and
spring
ah
yes
said
lady
craye
you
only
like
beginnings
even
summer
even
summer
as
you
say
he
answered
equably
the
sketch
is
always
so
much
better
than
the
picture
i
believe
that
is
your
philosophy
of
life
said
temple
this
man
vernon
explained
spends
his
days
in
doing
ripping
etchings
and
black
and
white
stuff
and
looking
for
my
philosophy
of
life
one
would
like
to
see
that
in
black
and
white
will
you
etch
it
for
me
temple
when
you
find
it
i
do
think
the
medium
would
be
adequate
temple
said
i
found
it
yet
but
i
should
fancy
it
would
be
rather
highly
coloured
iridescent
perhaps
did
you
ever
speculate
as
to
the
colour
of
people
souls
i
quite
sure
every
soul
has
a
colour
what
is
yours
asked
vernon
of
course
i
too
humble
to
tell
you
but
some
souls
are
thick
do
you
know
and
some
are
clear
like
jewels
and
mine
an
opal
is
it
with
more
green
in
it
perhaps
you
know
the
lovely
colour
on
the
dykes
in
the
marshes
stagnant
water
thank
you
i
do
know
what
it
is
it
has
some
hateful
chemical
name
i
daresay
they
have
vases
the
colour
i
mean
mounted
in
silver
at
the
army
and
navy
stores
and
your
soul
it
is
a
pearl
is
it
never
nothing
opaque
if
you
will
force
my
modesty
to
the
confession
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
it
is
a
sapphire
true
blue
do
you
know
and
temple
but
you
not
known
him
long
enough
to
judge
so
it
no
use
my
saying
that
i
am
sure
his
soul
is
a
dewdrop
to
be
dried
up
by
the
sun
of
life
temple
questioned
no
to
be
hardened
into
a
diamond
by
the
fire
of
life
no
explain
that
dewdrops
do
harden
into
diamonds
i
know
i
not
scientific
but
i
honestly
did
mean
to
be
complimentary
is
your
kettle
boiling
over
mr
vernon
lady
craye
eyes
while
they
delicately
condoled
with
vernon
on
the
spoiling
of
his
with
her
were
also
made
to
indicate
a
certain
interest
in
the
spoiler
temple
was
more
than
six
feet
high
well
built
he
had
regular
features
and
clear
gray
eyes
with
cases
and
very
long
dark
lashes
his
mouth
was
firm
and
its
lines
were
good
but
for
his
hair
and
for
a
bearing
at
once
frank
assured
and
modest
he
would
have
been
much
handsomer
than
a
man
has
any
need
to
be
but
his
expression
saved
him
no
one
had
ever
called
him
a
barber
block
or
a
hairdresser
apprentice
to
temple
lady
craye
appeared
the
most
charming
woman
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
an
effect
which
she
had
the
habit
of
producing
he
had
said
of
her
in
his
haste
that
she
was
all
clothes
and
no
woman
now
he
saw
that
on
the
contrary
the
clothes
were
quite
intimately
part
of
the
woman
and
took
such
value
as
they
had
from
her
she
carried
her
head
with
the
dainty
alertness
of
a
beautiful
bird
she
had
a
gift
denied
to
most
englishwomen
the
genius
for
wearing
clothes
no
one
had
ever
seen
her
dress
dusty
or
crushed
her
hat
crooked
no
uncomfortable
accidents
ever
happened
to
her
blacks
never
settled
on
her
face
the
buttons
never
came
off
her
gloves
she
never
lost
her
umbrella
and
in
the
windiest
weather
no
loose
untidy
wisps
escaped
from
her
thick
heavy
shining
hair
to
wander
unbecomingly
round
the
ears
that
were
pearly
and
pink
like
the
little
shells
of
vanessae
some
of
the
women
who
hated
her
used
to
say
that
she
dyed
her
hair
it
was
certainly
very
much
lighter
than
her
brows
and
lashes
she
was
wearing
a
corduroy
dress
of
a
gold
some
shades
grayer
than
the
gold
of
her
hair
sable
trimmed
it
and
violet
silk
lined
the
loose
sleeves
and
the
coat
now
unfastened
and
thrown
back
there
were
as
vernon
had
known
there
would
be
violets
under
the
brim
of
the
hat
that
matched
her
hair
the
chair
in
which
she
sat
wore
a
chinese
blue
drapery
the
yellow
gave
the
highest
note
in
the
picture
if
i
were
whistler
i
should
ask
you
to
let
me
paint
your
portrait
like
that
yes
with
my
despicable
yellow
in
your
honourable
hand
if
you
were
whistler
or
anything
in
the
least
like
whistler
i
should
be
drinking
tea
out
of
your
honourable
she
said
do
you
really
think
temple
that
one
ought
not
to
say
one
does
like
people
just
because
they
dead
he
had
been
thinking
something
a
little
like
it
well
he
said
rather
awkwardly
you
see
dead
people
ca
hit
back
no
more
can
live
ones
when
you
do
hit
them
but
only
stick
pins
in
their
effigies
i
rather
speak
ill
of
the
dead
than
the
living
yet
it
does
seem
fair
somehow
temple
insisted
but
why
no
one
can
go
and
tell
the
poor
things
what
people
are
saying
of
them
you
do
go
and
unfold
a
shroud
just
to
whisper
in
a
corpse
ear
was
horrid
of
her
to
say
it
but
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
dear
and
if
you
did
they
would
lie
awake
at
night
worrying
over
it
as
the
poor
live
people
no
more
tea
thank
you
do
you
really
think
anyone
worries
about
what
anyone
says
do
you
mr
temple
he
reflected
he
never
has
anything
to
worry
about
vernon
put
in
no
one
ever
says
anything
unkind
about
him
the
cruelest
thing
anyone
ever
said
of
him
was
that
he
would
make
as
excellent
a
husband
as
albert
the
good
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
my
felicitations
lady
craye
smiled
them
temple
flushed
now
is
it
odd
vernon
asked
that
however
much
one
plumes
oneself
on
one
blamelessness
one
hates
to
hear
it
attributed
to
one
by
others
one
is
good
by
stealth
and
blushes
to
find
it
fame
i
myself
yes
said
lady
craye
with
an
accent
of
finality
what
a
man
really
likes
is
to
be
saint
with
the
reputation
of
being
a
bit
of
a
devil
and
a
woman
likes
you
think
to
be
a
bit
of
a
devil
with
the
reputation
of
a
saint
or
a
bit
of
a
saint
with
a
reputation
that
rhymes
to
the
reality
it
the
reputation
that
important
is
it
is
the
inward
truth
the
really
important
thing
said
temple
rather
heavily
lady
craye
looked
at
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
understand
that
she
understood
vernon
looked
at
them
both
and
turning
to
the
window
looked
out
on
his
admired
roofs
yes
she
said
very
softly
but
one
does
talk
about
that
any
more
than
one
does
of
one
prayers
or
one
love
affairs
the
plural
vexed
temple
and
he
told
himself
how
unreasonable
the
vexation
was
lady
craye
turned
her
charming
head
to
look
at
him
to
look
at
vernon
one
had
been
in
love
with
her
the
other
might
be
there
is
in
the
world
no
better
company
than
this
temple
always
deeply
uninterested
in
women
clothes
was
noting
the
long
firm
folds
of
her
skirt
vernon
had
turned
from
the
window
to
approve
the
loving
closeness
of
those
violets
against
her
hair
lady
craye
in
her
graceful
attitude
of
conscious
unconsciousness
was
the
focus
of
their
eyes
here
comes
a
millionaire
to
buy
your
pictures
she
said
suddenly
no
a
millionairess
by
the
sound
of
her
shoes
how
beautiful
are
the
feet
the
men
had
heard
nothing
but
following
hard
on
her
words
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
along
the
little
corridor
an
agitated
knock
on
the
door
vernon
opened
the
door
to
betty
oh
come
in
he
said
cordially
and
his
pause
of
absolute
astonishment
was
brief
as
an
this
is
delightful
and
as
she
passed
into
the
room
he
caught
her
eyes
and
looking
a
warning
said
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
i
began
to
be
afraid
you
would
be
able
to
come
i
saw
you
in
the
bois
the
other
day
said
lady
craye
and
i
have
been
wanting
to
know
you
ever
since
you
are
very
kind
said
betty
her
hat
was
on
one
side
her
hair
was
very
untidy
and
it
was
not
a
becoming
untidiness
either
she
had
no
gloves
and
a
bit
of
the
velvet
binding
of
her
skirt
was
loose
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
with
crying
there
was
a
black
smudge
on
her
cheek
take
this
chair
said
vernon
and
moved
a
comfortable
one
with
its
back
to
the
light
temple
let
me
present
you
to
miss
desmond
temple
bowed
with
no
flicker
of
recognition
visible
in
his
face
but
betty
flushing
scarlet
said
temple
and
i
have
met
before
there
was
the
tiniest
pause
then
temple
said
i
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
again
i
thought
you
had
perhaps
left
paris
let
me
give
you
some
tea
said
vernon
tea
was
made
for
her
and
conversation
she
drank
the
tea
but
she
seemed
not
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
conversation
it
fluttered
aimlessly
like
a
bird
with
a
broken
wing
lady
craye
did
her
best
but
talk
is
not
easy
when
each
one
of
a
party
has
its
own
secret
interest
and
an
overlapping
interest
in
the
preoccupation
of
the
others
the
air
was
too
electric
lady
craye
had
it
on
her
lips
that
she
must
go
when
betty
rose
suddenly
she
said
generally
looking
round
with
miserable
eyes
that
tried
to
look
merely
polite
must
you
go
asked
vernon
furious
with
the
complicated
emotions
that
warring
in
him
left
him
just
as
helpless
as
anyone
else
i
do
hope
we
shall
meet
again
said
lady
craye
may
i
see
you
home
asked
temple
unexpectedly
even
to
himself
betty
no
thank
you
was
most
definite
she
went
vernon
had
to
let
her
go
he
had
guests
he
could
not
leave
them
he
had
lost
wholly
his
ordinary
control
of
circumstances
all
through
the
petrifying
awkwardness
of
the
late
talk
he
had
been
seeking
an
excuse
to
go
with
betty
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
he
closed
the
door
and
came
back
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
there
was
help
lady
craye
gave
it
she
rose
as
vernon
came
back
quick
she
said
shall
we
go
had
you
better
bring
her
back
here
go
after
her
at
once
you
an
angel
said
vernon
no
do
go
temple
look
after
lady
craye
if
you
not
think
me
rude
miss
desmond
is
in
trouble
i
afraid
of
course
she
is
poor
little
thing
oh
vernon
do
run
she
looks
quite
despairing
there
your
hat
go
go
the
door
banged
behind
her
the
other
two
left
alone
looked
at
each
other
i
wonder
said
she
yes
said
he
it
certainly
mysterious
we
ought
to
have
gone
at
once
said
she
i
should
have
done
of
course
only
vernon
so
elaborately
explained
that
he
expected
her
one
had
to
play
up
and
so
she
a
friend
of
yours
she
not
a
friend
of
mine
said
temple
rather
ruefully
and
i
did
know
vernon
was
a
friend
of
hers
you
saw
that
she
have
my
company
at
any
price
vernon
a
friend
of
her
people
i
believe
we
saw
her
the
other
day
in
the
bois
and
he
told
me
he
knew
them
in
england
did
you
know
them
there
too
poor
child
what
a
little
face
it
was
no
not
in
england
i
met
her
in
paris
about
a
fortnight
ago
but
she
did
like
me
from
the
first
and
our
acquaintance
broke
off
short
there
was
a
silence
lady
craye
perceived
a
of
reticence
round
the
subject
that
interested
her
and
knew
that
she
had
no
art
strong
enough
to
break
it
down
she
spoke
again
suddenly
do
you
know
you
not
a
bit
the
kind
of
man
i
expected
you
to
be
temple
i
heard
so
much
of
you
from
vernon
we
such
old
friends
you
know
apparently
he
ca
paint
so
well
with
words
as
he
does
with
oils
may
i
ask
exactly
how
flattering
the
portrait
was
it
was
flattering
at
in
fact
it
was
a
portrait
a
caricature
but
you
do
mind
what
people
say
of
you
do
you
you
are
trying
to
frighten
me
no
really
she
said
with
pretty
earnestness
it
only
that
he
has
always
talked
about
you
as
his
best
friend
and
i
imagined
you
would
be
like
him
temple
uneasy
wonderings
about
betty
trouble
her
acquaintance
with
vernon
the
meaning
of
her
visit
to
him
were
pushed
to
the
back
of
his
mind
i
wish
i
were
like
him
said
he
at
any
rate
in
his
paintings
at
any
rate
yes
but
one
ca
have
everything
you
know
you
have
qualities
which
he
has
qualities
that
you
would
exchange
for
any
qualities
of
his
that
was
what
i
meant
i
the
fact
is
i
like
old
vernon
but
i
ca
understand
him
that
philosophy
of
life
eludes
you
still
now
i
understand
him
but
i
do
always
like
him
not
all
of
him
i
wonder
whether
anyone
understands
him
he
not
such
a
sphinx
as
he
looks
her
tone
betrayed
a
slight
pique
now
your
character
would
be
much
harder
to
read
that
one
of
the
differences
we
are
all
transparent
enough
to
those
who
look
through
the
right
glasses
said
temple
and
part
of
my
character
is
my
inability
to
find
any
glass
through
which
i
could
see
him
clearly
this
comparison
of
his
character
and
vernon
with
its
sudden
assumption
of
intimacy
charmed
yet
embarrassed
him
she
saw
both
emotions
and
pitied
him
a
little
but
it
was
necessary
to
interest
this
young
man
enough
to
keep
him
there
till
vernon
should
return
then
vernon
would
see
her
home
and
she
might
find
out
something
however
little
about
betty
but
if
this
young
man
went
she
too
must
go
she
could
not
outstay
him
in
the
rooms
of
his
friend
so
she
talked
on
and
temple
was
just
as
much
at
her
mercy
as
betty
had
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
brother
artist
in
the
rabbit
warren
at
long
barton
but
at
seven
vernon
had
not
returned
and
it
was
after
all
temple
who
saw
her
home
temple
free
from
the
immediate
enchantment
of
her
presence
felt
the
revival
of
a
resentful
curiosity
why
had
betty
refused
his
help
why
had
she
sought
vernon
why
did
women
treat
him
as
though
he
were
a
curate
and
vernon
as
though
he
were
a
god
well
lady
craye
at
least
had
not
treated
him
as
curates
are
treated
chapter
xiv
renunciation
vernon
tore
down
the
stairs
three
and
four
at
a
time
and
caught
betty
as
she
was
stepping
into
a
hired
carriage
what
is
it
he
asked
what
the
matter
oh
go
back
to
your
friends
said
betty
angrily
my
friends
are
all
right
they
amuse
each
other
tell
me
then
you
must
come
with
me
said
she
if
i
try
to
tell
you
here
i
shall
begin
to
cry
again
do
speak
to
me
i
ca
bear
it
he
got
into
the
carriage
it
was
not
until
betty
had
let
herself
into
her
room
and
he
had
followed
her
in
not
till
they
stood
face
to
face
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
that
he
spoke
again
now
he
said
what
is
it
where
your
aunt
and
sit
down
wo
you
she
said
pulling
off
her
hat
and
throwing
it
on
the
couch
it
take
rather
a
long
time
to
tell
but
i
must
tell
you
all
about
it
or
else
you
ca
help
me
and
if
you
do
help
me
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
despair
was
in
her
voice
he
sat
down
betty
in
the
chair
opposite
his
sat
with
hands
nervously
locked
together
look
here
she
said
abruptly
you
sure
to
think
that
everything
i
done
is
wrong
but
it
no
use
your
saying
so
i
wo
say
so
well
then
that
day
you
know
after
i
saw
you
at
the
bête
madame
gautier
did
come
to
fetch
me
and
i
waited
and
waited
and
at
last
i
went
to
her
flat
and
she
was
dead
and
i
ought
to
have
telegraphed
to
my
to
fetch
me
but
i
thought
i
would
like
to
have
one
night
in
paris
first
you
know
i
had
seen
paris
at
all
really
yes
he
said
trying
not
to
let
any
anxiety
into
his
voice
yes
go
on
and
i
went
to
the
café
what
did
you
say
nothing
i
thought
it
was
where
the
art
students
went
and
i
met
a
girl
there
and
she
was
kind
to
me
what
sort
of
a
girl
not
an
art
student
no
said
betty
hardly
she
was
an
art
student
she
told
me
what
she
was
yes
and
i
i
do
think
i
should
have
done
it
just
for
me
alone
but
i
did
want
to
stay
in
paris
and
work
and
i
wanted
to
help
her
to
be
good
she
good
really
in
spite
of
everything
oh
i
know
horribly
shocked
but
i
ca
help
it
and
now
she
gone
and
i
ca
find
her
i
not
shocked
he
said
deliberately
but
i
extremely
stupid
how
gone
she
was
living
with
me
oh
she
found
the
rooms
and
showed
me
where
to
go
for
meals
and
gave
me
good
advice
oh
she
did
everything
for
me
and
now
she
gone
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
paris
is
such
a
horrible
place
perhaps
she
been
kidnapped
or
something
and
i
do
know
even
how
to
tell
the
police
and
all
this
time
i
talking
to
you
is
wasted
time
it
is
wasted
but
i
must
understand
you
met
this
girl
and
she
she
asked
your
friend
temple
he
was
passing
and
she
called
out
to
him
to
tell
me
of
a
decent
hotel
but
he
asked
so
many
questions
he
gave
me
an
address
and
i
did
go
i
went
back
to
her
and
we
went
to
a
hotel
and
i
persuaded
her
to
come
and
live
with
me
but
your
aunt
betty
explained
about
her
aunt
and
your
father
she
explained
about
her
father
and
now
she
has
gone
and
you
want
to
find
her
want
to
find
her
betty
started
up
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
i
do
care
about
anything
else
in
the
world
she
a
dear
you
do
know
what
a
dear
she
is
and
i
know
she
was
happy
here
and
now
she
gone
i
never
had
a
girl
friend
before
what
vernon
had
winced
just
as
paula
had
winced
and
at
the
same
words
you
looked
for
her
at
the
café
no
i
promised
her
that
i
never
go
there
again
she
seems
to
have
given
you
some
good
advice
she
advised
me
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
said
betty
suddenly
spiteful
that
was
good
advice
when
she
gave
it
said
vernon
quietly
but
now
it
different
he
was
silent
a
moment
realising
with
a
wonder
beyond
words
how
different
it
was
every
word
every
glance
between
him
and
betty
had
hitherto
been
part
of
a
play
she
had
been
a
charming
figure
in
a
charming
comedy
he
had
known
as
it
were
by
rote
that
she
had
feelings
a
heart
affections
but
they
had
seemed
pale
just
a
delightful
background
to
his
own
sensations
strong
and
conscious
and
delicate
now
for
the
first
time
he
perceived
her
as
real
a
human
being
in
the
stress
of
a
real
human
emotion
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
protective
tenderness
a
real
primitive
sentiment
with
no
smell
of
the
footlights
about
it
he
was
alone
with
betty
he
was
the
only
person
in
paris
to
whom
she
could
turn
for
help
what
an
opportunity
for
a
fine
scene
in
his
best
manner
and
he
found
that
he
did
not
want
a
scene
he
wanted
to
help
her
why
do
you
say
something
she
said
impatiently
what
am
i
to
do
you
ca
do
anything
i
do
everything
you
say
she
knows
temple
well
i
find
him
and
we
go
to
her
lodgings
and
find
out
if
she
there
you
do
know
the
address
no
said
betty
i
went
there
but
it
was
at
night
and
i
do
even
know
the
street
now
look
here
he
took
both
her
hands
and
held
them
firmly
you
are
to
worry
i
do
everything
perhaps
she
has
been
taken
ill
in
that
case
when
we
find
her
she
need
you
to
look
after
her
you
must
rest
i
certain
to
find
her
you
must
eat
something
i
send
you
in
some
dinner
and
then
lie
down
i
could
sleep
said
betty
looking
at
him
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
that
has
cried
its
heart
out
of
course
you
could
lie
down
and
make
yourself
read
i
get
back
as
soon
as
i
can
there
was
something
further
that
wanted
to
get
itself
said
but
the
words
that
came
nearest
to
expressing
it
were
god
bless
you
and
he
did
not
say
them
on
the
top
of
his
staircase
he
found
temple
lounging
hullo
still
here
i
afraid
i
been
a
devil
of
a
time
gone
but
miss
desmond
i
do
want
to
shove
my
oar
in
said
temple
but
i
came
back
when
i
seen
lady
craye
home
i
hope
there
nothing
wrong
with
miss
desmond
come
in
said
vernon
i
tell
you
the
whole
thing
they
went
into
the
room
desolate
with
the
disorder
of
half
empty
cups
and
scattered
plates
with
crumbs
of
cake
on
them
miss
desmond
told
me
about
her
meeting
you
well
she
gave
you
the
slip
she
went
back
and
got
that
woman
lottie
what
her
name
and
took
her
to
live
with
her
good
god
she
did
know
of
course
but
she
did
know
that
the
blow
she
knew
and
she
wanted
to
save
her
temple
was
silent
a
moment
i
say
you
know
though
that
rather
fine
he
said
presently
oh
yes
said
vernon
impatiently
it
very
romantic
and
all
that
well
the
woman
stayed
a
fortnight
and
disappeared
miss
desmond
is
breaking
her
heart
about
her
so
she
took
her
up
and
she
rather
young
for
rescue
work
rescue
work
bah
she
talks
of
the
woman
as
the
only
girl
friend
she
ever
had
and
the
woman
probably
gone
off
with
her
watch
and
chain
and
a
collection
of
light
valuables
only
i
could
tell
miss
desmond
that
so
i
promised
to
try
and
find
the
woman
she
a
thorough
bad
lot
i
run
up
against
her
once
or
twice
with
chaps
i
know
she
not
sort
said
temple
i
know
her
fairly
well
what
sir
galahad
oh
i
wo
ask
inconvenient
questions
sneer
was
not
pretty
she
used
to
live
with
de
villermay
said
temple
steadily
he
was
the
first
the
usual
coffee
maker
business
you
know
though
god
knows
how
an
english
girl
got
into
it
when
he
went
home
to
be
married
it
was
rather
beastly
the
father
came
up
offered
her
a
present
she
threw
it
at
him
then
schauermacher
wanted
her
to
live
with
him
no
she
go
to
the

all
that
they
found
her
one
of
a
party
of
four

nodded
to
them
and
presently

her
party
and
came
to
spread
her
black
and
white
flounces
at
their
table

best
news

asked
gaily

hundred

i
meant
by
daring
to
contaminate
an
innocent
girl
by
my
society
well
you
can
go
to
hell
and
ask
there
she
rose
knocking
over
a
chair
do
go
said
vernon
that
not
what
we
want
to
ask
too
she
turned
fiercely
on
him
as
if
you
were
a
king
or
a
deputation
one
and
one
two
said
vernon
and
i
did
very
much
want
to
talk
to
you
and
two

had
turned
her
head
away
you
are
going
to
be
cruel

well

him
off

i
wo
be
bullied
by
a
crowd
of
you
temple
took
off
his
hat
and
went
i
got
an
appointment
i
no
time

said
vernon
first
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
care
you
taken
of
miss
desmond
and
for
all
your
kindness
and
goodness
to
her
oh
was
all
paula
could
say
she
had
expected
something
so
different
i
do
see
what
business
it
is
of
yours
though
she
added
next
moment
only
that
she
alone
here
and
i
the
only
person
she
knows
in
paris
and
i
know
much
better
than
she
does
all
that
you
done
for
her
sake
i
did
it
for
my
own
sake
it
was
no
end
of
a
lark
said
paula
eagerly
that
little
dull
pious
life
and
all
the
time
i
used
to
laugh
inside
to
think
what
a
sentimental
fool
she
was
yes
said
vernon
slowly
it
must
have
been
amusing
for
you
i
just
did
it
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
but
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
so
i
just
came
away
i
was
bored
to
death
yes
he
said
you
must
have
been
just
playing
at
cooking
and
housework
reading
aloud
to
her
while
she
drew
yes
she
told
me
that
and
the
flowers
and
all
her
little
trumpery
odds
and
ends
about
awfully
amusing
it
must
have
been
do
said
paula
and
to
have
her
loving
you
and
trusting
you
as
she
did
awfully
comic
was
it
calling
you
her
shut
up
will
you
and
thinking
she
had
created
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
you
silly
sentimental
little
will
you
hold
your
tongue
so
long
lottie
cried
the
girl
of
her
party
we
off
to
the
bullier
you
got
better
fish
to
fry
i
see
yes
said
paula
with
sudden
effrontery
perhaps
we
look
in
later
the
others
laughed
and
went
now
she
said
turning
furiously
on
vernon
will
you
go
or
shall
i
i
do
want
any
more
of
you
just
one
word
more
he
said
with
the
odd
change
of
expression
that
made
him
look
young
tell
me
why
you
left
her
she
crying
her
eyes
out
for
you
why
i
left
her
because
i
was
sick
of
do
let
me
tell
you
you
went
with
her
because
she
was
alone
and
friendless
you
found
her
rooms
you
set
her
in
the
way
of
making
friends
and
when
you
saw
that
she
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
happy
and
comfortable
you
came
away
because
because
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
because
you
were
afraid
afraid
afraid
of
handicapping
her
you
knew
you
would
meet
people
who
knew
you
you
gave
it
all
up
all
the
new
life
the
new
chances
for
her
sake
and
came
away
do
i
understand
is
it
paula
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
chin
on
her
hands
you
not
like
most
men
she
said
you
make
me
out
better
than
i
am
that
not
the
usual
mistake
yes
it
all
that
partly
and
i
should
have
liked
to
stay
for
ever
and
ever
if
i
could
but
suppose
i
could
suppose
i
begun
to
find
myself
wishing
for
all
sorts
of
things
longing
for
them
suppose
i
stayed
till
i
began
to
think
of
things
that
i
think
of
while
was
with
me
what
i
was
afraid
of
and
you
did
long
for
the
old
life
at
all
she
laughed
long
for
that
but
i
might
have
i
might
have
it
was
well
go
back
to
her
and
tell
her
i
gone
to
the
devil
and
it
not
her
fault
tell
her
i
was
worth
saving
but
i
did
try
to
save
her
if
you
half
a
man
you
wo
undo
my
one
little
bit
of
work
what
do
you
mean
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
let
the
girl
alone
he
leaned
forward
and
spoke
very
earnestly
look
here
he
said
i
wo
jaw
but
this
about
you
and
her
well
it
made
a
difference
to
me
that
i
ca
explain
and
i
would
own
that
to
anyone
but
friend
i
mean
to
be
a
friend
to
her
too
a
good
friend
no
nonsense
swear
it
by
god
in
heaven
she
said
fiercely
i
do
swear
it
he
said
by
god
in
heaven
and
i
ca
tell
her
you
gone
to
the
devil
you
must
write
to
her
and
you
ca
tell
her
that
either
what
the
good
of
writing
a
lie
or
two
is
much
when
you
done
all
this
for
her
come
up
to
my
place
you
can
write
to
her
there
this
was
the
letter
that
paula
wrote
in
vernon
studio
among
the
cups
and
the
scattered
plates
with
on
them
my
dear
little
betty
i
must
leave
without
saying
and
i
shall
never
see
you
again
my
father
has
taken
me
back
i
wrote
to
him
and
he
came
and
found
me
he
has
forgiven
me
everything
only
i
have
had
to
promise
never
to
speak
to
anyone
i
knew
in
paris
it
is
all
your
doing
dear
god
bless
you
you
have
saved
me
i
shall
pray
for
you
every
day
as
long
as
i
live
your
poor
paula
will
that
do
she
laughed
as
she
held
out
the
letter
he
read
it
and
he
did
not
laugh
yes
that
do
he
said
i
tell
her
you
gone
to
england
and
i
send
the
letter
to
london
to
be
posted
then
that
all
settled
can
i
do
anything
for
he
asked
god
himself
ca
do
anything
for
me
she
said
biting
the
edge
of
her
veil
where
are
you
going
now
back
to
the
it
early
yet
she
stood
defiantly
smiling
at
him
what
were
you
doing
there
the
night
you
met
her
he
asked
abruptly
what
does
one
do
what
become
of
de
villermay
he
asked
gone
home
got
married
and
so
you
thought
oh
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
thought
you
welcome
i
thought
damn
myself
as
deep
as
i
could
to
pile
up
the
reckoning
for
him
and
i
about
done
it
i
must
be
getting
on
i
come
a
bit
of
the
way
with
you
he
said
at
the
door
he
turned
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
gently
and
reverently
that
very
sweet
of
you
she
opened
astonished
eyes
at
him
i
always
used
to
think
you
an
awful
brute
it
was
very
theatrical
of
me
he
told
himself
later
but
it
summed
up
the
situation
sentimental
ass
you
growing
betty
got
her
letter
from
england
and
cried
over
it
and
was
glad
over
it
i
have
done
one
thing
anyway
she
told
herself
one
really
truly
good
thing
i
saved
my
poor
dear
paula
oh
how
right
i
was
how
i
knew
her
book
the
other
woman
chapter
xv
on
mount
parnassus
at
long
barton
the
reverend
cecil
had
strayed
into
betty
room
now
no
longer
boudoir
and
bedchamber
but
just
a
room
swept
dusted
tidy
with
the
horrible
tidiness
of
a
room
that
is
not
used
there
were
squares
of
bright
yellow
on
the
dull
drab
of
the
marking
the
old
hanging
places
of
the
photographs
and
pictures
that
betty
had
taken
to
paris
he
opened
the
cupboard
door
one
or
two
faded
skirts
a
flattened
garden
hat
and
a
pair
of
betty
old
shoes
he
shut
the
door
again
quickly
as
though
he
had
seen
betty
ghost
the
next
time
he
went
to
sevenoaks
he
looked
in
at
the
builders
and
decorators
gave
an
order
and
chose
a
wall
paper
with
little
pink
roses
on
it
when
betty
came
home
for
christmas
she
should
not
find
her
room
the
faded
desert
it
was
now
he
ordered
pink
curtains
to
match
the
rosebuds
and
it
was
when
he
got
home
that
he
found
the
letter
that
told
him
she
was
not
to
come
at
christmas
but
he
did
not
countermand
his
order
if
not
at
christmas
then
at
easter
and
whenever
it
was
she
should
find
her
room
a
bower
since
she
had
been
away
he
had
felt
more
and
more
the
need
to
express
his
affection
he
had
expressed
it
he
thought
to
the
uttermost
by
letting
her
go
at
all
and
now
he
wanted
to
express
it
in
detail
by
pink
curtains
with
pink
roses
the
paper
cost
two
shillings
a
piece
and
he
gloated
over
the
extravagance
and
over
his
pretty
poetic
choice
usually
the
at
the
rectory
had
been
chosen
by
betty
and
the
price
limited
to
sixpence
he
would
refrain
from
buying
that
fuller
church
history
the
beautiful
brown
folio
whose
perfect
boards
and
rich
yellow
paper
had
lived
in
his
dreams
for
the
last
three
weeks
ever
since
he
came
upon
it
in
the
rag
and
bone
shop
in
the
little
back
street
in
maidstone
when
the
rosebud
paper
and
the
pink
curtains
were
in
their
place
the
shabby
carpet
was
an
insult
to
their
bright
prettiness
the
reverend
cecil
bought
an
oriental
carpet
of
the
jute
variety
and
was
relieved
to
find
that
it
only
cost
a
pound
the
leaves
were
falling
in
brown
dry
showers
in
the
rectory
garden
the
chrysanthemums
were
nearly
over
the
dahlias
blackened
and
blighted
by
the
first
frosts
a
few
pale
blooms
still
clung
to
the
gaunt
hollyhock
stems
here
and
there
camomile
flowers
medicine
daisies
betty
used
to
call
them
when
she
was
little
their
whiteness
tarnished
showed
among
bent
dry
stalks
of
flowers
dead
and
forgotten
round
betty
window
the
monthly
rose
bloomed
pale
and
pink
amid
disheartened
foliage
the
damp
began
to
shew
on
the
north
walls
of
the
rooms
a
fire
in
the
study
now
daily
for
the
sake
of
the
books
one
in
the
weekly
for
the
sake
of
the
piano
and
the
furniture
and
for
betty
in
paris
a
fire
of
crackling
twigs
and
long
logs
in
the
rusty
and
blue
and
yellow
flames
leaping
to
lick
the
royal
arms
of
france
on
the
the
rooms
were
lonely
to
betty
now
that
paula
was
gone
she
missed
her
inexpressibly
but
the
loneliness
was
lighted
by
a
glow
of
pride
of
triumph
of
achievement
her
deception
of
her
was
justified
she
had
been
the
means
of
saving
paula
but
for
her
paula
would
not
have
returned
like
the
prodigal
son
to
the
father
house
betty
pictured
her
there
subdued
saddened
but
inexpressibly
happy
warming
her
cramped
heart
in
the
sun
of
forgiveness
and
love
thank
god
i
have
done
some
good
in
the
world
said
betty
in
the
brief
interview
which
vernon
took
to
tell
her
that
paula
had
gone
to
england
with
her
father
betty
noticed
no
change
in
him
she
had
no
thought
for
him
then
and
in
the
next
weeks
when
she
had
thoughts
for
him
she
did
not
see
him
she
could
not
but
be
glad
that
he
was
in
paris
in
the
midst
of
her
new
experiences
he
seemed
to
her
like
an
old
friend
yet
his
being
there
put
a
different
complexion
on
her
act
of
mutiny
when
she
decided
to
deceive
her
and
to
stay
on
in
paris
alone
paula
had
been
to
be
saved
and
had
been
to
her
thought
in
vienna
not
to
be
met
now
paula
was
gone
and
he
was
here
in
the
night
when
betty
lay
wakeful
and
heard
the
hours
chimed
by
a
convent
bell
whose
voice
was
toneless
and
gray
as
an
autumn
sky
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
was
wrong
that
she
had
committed
a
fault
that
was
almost
a
crime
that
there
was
nothing
now
to
be
done
but
to
confess
to
go
home
and
to
expiate
as
the
prodigal
son
doubtless
did
among
the
thorny
roses
of
forgiveness
those
days
in
the
far
country
but
always
with
the
morning
light
came
the
remembrance
that
it
was
not
her
father
house
to
which
she
must
go
to
make
submission
it
was
her
and
after
all
it
was
her
own
life
she
had
to
live
it
once
that
confession
and
submission
made
she
saw
herself
enslaved
beyond
hope
of
freedom
meanwhile
here
was
the
glad
gay
life
of
independence
new
experiences
new
sensations
and
her
was
doubtless
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
it
is
as
though
anyone
wanted
me
at
home
she
said
and
everything
here
is
so
new
and
good
and
i
have
quite
a
few
friends
already
and
i
shall
have
more
this
is
what
they
call
seeing
life
life
as
she
saw
it
was
good
to
see
the
darker
grimmer
side
of
the
student
life
was
wholly
hidden
from
betty
she
saw
only
a
colony
of
young
artists
of
all
nations
but
most
of
england
and
america
all
good
friends
and
comrades
working
and
playing
with
an
equal
enthusiasm
she
saw
girls
treated
as
equals
and
friends
by
the
men
students
if
money
were
short
it
was
borrowed
from
the
first
friend
one
met
and
quite
usually
repaid
when
the
home
allowance
arrived
a
young
man
would
borrow
from
a
young
woman
or
a
young
woman
from
a
young
man
as
freely
as
from
each
other
most
girls
had
a
special
friend
among
the
boys
betty
thought
at
first
that
these
must
be
betrothed
lovers
miss
voscoe
the
american
stared
when
she
put
the
question
about
a
pair
who
had
just
left
the
restaurant
together
with
the
announcement
that
they
were
off
to
the
musée
cluny
for
the
afternoon
engaged
not
that
i
know
of
why
should
they
be
she
said
in
a
tone
that
convicted
betty
of
a
social
lapse
in
the
putting
of
the
question
yet
she
defended
herself
well
you
know
in
england
people
do
generally
go
about
together
like
that
unless
they
engaged
or
relations
yes
said
miss
voscoe
filling
her
glass
from
the
little
bottle
of
weak
white
wine
that
costs
threepence
at
garnier
i
heard
that
is
so
in
your
country
your
girls
always
marry
the
wrong
man
they
because
he
the
first
and
only
one
they
ever
had
the
privilege
of
conversing
with
not
quite
always
i
hope
said
betty
good
humouredly
now
in
our
country
miss
voscoe
went
on
girls
look
around
so
as
they
can
tell
there
more
different
sorts
of
boys
than
there
are
of
squashes
then
when
they
get
married
to
a
husband
it
because
they
like
him
or
because
they
like
his
dollars
or
for
some
reason
that
is
just
that
he
the
only
one
they
ever
said
five
words
on
end
to
there
something
in
that
betty
owned
but
my
aunt
says
men
never
want
to
be
friends
with
girls
they
always
want
to
flirt
may
be
they
do
though
i
do
think
so
our
men
do
any
way
but
if
the
girl
does
want
to
flirt
things
wo
get
very
tangled
up
but
suppose
a
man
got
really
fond
of
you
then
he
might
think
you
liked
him
too
if
you
were
always
about
with
him
do
him
good
to
have
his
eyes
opened
then
besides
who
always
about
with
anyone
you
have
a
special
friend
for
a
bit
and
just
walk
around
and
see
the
sights
and
then
change
partners
and
have
a
turn
with
somebody
else
it
just
like
at
a
dance
nobody
thinks
you
in
love
because
you
dance
three
or
four
times
running
with
one
boy
betty
reflected
as
she
ate
her
de
it
was
certainly
true
that
she
had
seen
changes
of
partners
milly
leger
the
belle
of
the
students
quarter
changed
her
partners
every
week
you
see
the
american
went
on
we
not
the
kind
that
come
here
to
study
what
we
want
is
to
learn
to
paint
and
to
have
a
good
time
in
between
you
make
any
mistake
miss
desmond
this
time
in
paris
is
time
of
our
lives
to
most
of
us
it
what
we
have
to
look
back
at
and
talk
about
and
suppose
every
time
there
was
any
fun
going
we
had
to
send
around
to
the
nearest
store
for
a
chaperon
how
much
fun
would
there
be
left
by
the
time
she
toddled
in
no
the
folks
at
home
who
trust
us
to
work
trust
us
to
play
and
we
have
our
little
heads
screwed
on
the
right
way
betty
remembered
that
she
had
been
trusted
neither
for
play
nor
work
yet
from
the
home
standpoint
she
had
been
trustworthy
more
trustworthy
than
most
she
had
not
asked
vernon
her
only
friend
to
come
and
see
her
and
when
he
had
said
when
shall
i
see
you
again
she
had
answered
i
do
know
thank
you
very
much
i
do
know
how
were
raised
miss
voscoe
went
on
but
i
guess
it
was
in
the
pretty
sheltered
home
life
now
i
bet
you
fell
in
love
with
the
first
man
that
said
three
polite
words
to
you
i
not
twenty
yet
said
betty
with
ears
and
face
of
scarlet
oh
you
mean
i
to
think
nobody
had
time
to
say
those
three
polite
words
yet
you
come
right
along
to
my
studio
i
got
a
tea
on
and
i
see
if
i
ca
introduce
my
friends
to
you
by
threes
so
as
you
get
nine
polite
words
at
once
you
ca
fall
in
love
with
three
boys
a
minute
can
you
betty
went
home
and
put
on
her
prettiest
frock
after
all
one
was
risking
a
good
deal
for
this
paris
life
and
one
might
as
well
get
as
much
out
of
it
as
one
could
and
one
always
had
a
better
time
of
it
when
one
was
decently
dressed
her
gown
was
of
velvet
with
green
undersleeves
and
touches
of
dull
red
and
green
embroidery
at
elbows
and
collar
miss
voscoe
studio
was
at
the
top
of
a
hundred
and
seventeen
polished
wooden
steps
and
as
betty
neared
the
top
flight
the
sound
of
talking
and
laughter
came
down
to
her
mixed
with
the
rattle
of
china
and
the
subdued
tinkle
of
a
mandolin
she
opened
the
door
the
room
seemed
full
of
people
but
she
only
saw
two
one
was
vernon
and
the
other
was
temple
betty
furiously
resented
the
blush
that
hotly
covered
neck
ears
and
face
here
you
are
cried
miss
voscoe
she
was
kind
she
gave
but
one
fleet
glance
at
the
blush
and
linking
her
arm
in
betty
led
her
round
the
room
betty
heard
her
name
and
other
names
people
were
being
introduced
to
her
she
heard
pleased
to
know
you
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
delighted
to
meet
you
and
realised
that
her
circle
of
american
acquaintances
was
widening
when
miss
voscoe
paused
with
her
before
the
group
of
which
temple
and
vernon
formed
part
betty
felt
as
though
her
face
had
swelled
to
that
degree
that
her
eyes
must
with
the
next
red
wave
start
out
of
her
head
the
two
hands
held
out
in
successive
greeting
gave
miss
voscoe
the
key
to
betty
flushed
entrance
she
drew
her
quickly
away
and
led
her
up
to
a
glaring
poster
where
a
young
woman
in
a
big
red
hat
sat
at
a
café
table
and
under
cover
of
betty
purely
automatic
recognition
of
the
composition
talent
murmured
which
of
them
was
it
i
beg
your
pardon
betty
mechanically
offered
the
deferent
defence
which
was
it
that
said
the
three
polite
words
before
you
ever
met
anyone
else
ah
said
betty
you
so
clever
too
clever
to
live
yes
said
miss
voscoe
but
before
i
die
which
was
it
i
was
going
to
say
said
betty
her
face
slowly
drawing
back
into
itself
its
natural
colouring
that
you
so
clever
you
do
want
to
be
told
things
if
you
sure
it
one
of
them
you
ought
to
know
which
well
remarked
miss
voscoe
i
guess
mr
temple
did
i
say
you
were
clever
said
betty
then
it
the
other
one
before
the
studio
tea
was
over
vernon
and
temple
both
had
conveyed
to
betty
the
information
that
it
was
the
hope
of
meeting
her
that
had
drawn
them
to
miss
voscoe
studio
that
afternoon
because
after
all
said
vernon
we
know
each
other
better
than
either
of
us
knows
anyone
else
in
paris
and
if
you
let
me
i
could
put
you
to
a
thing
or
two
in
the
matter
of
your
work
after
all
i
been
through
the
mill
it
very
kind
of
you
said
betty
but
i
all
alone
now
gone
and
we
respect
the
conventions
said
vernon
gaily
but
the
conventions
of
the
quartier
latin
are
the
conventions
of
clapham
no
i
know
said
she
but
there
a
point
of
honour
she
paused
there
are
reasons
she
added
why
i
ought
to
be
more
conventional
than
clapham
i
should
like
to
tell
you
some
time
only
but
i
have
got
anyone
to
tell
anything
to
i
wonder
what
what
do
you
wonder
betty
spoke
with
effort
i
know
it
sounds
insane
but
you
know
my
stepfather
thought
you
you
wanted
to
marry
me
you
did
ever
did
you
vernon
was
silent
none
of
his
habitual
defences
served
him
in
this
hour
you
see
betty
went
on
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
such
nonsense
if
i
knew
you
cared
about
someone
else
everything
would
be
so
simple
eliminate
love
said
vernon
and
the
world
is
a
simple
example
in
vulgar
fractions
i
want
it
to
be
simple
addition
said
betty
lady
craye
is
very
beautiful
yes
said
vernon
is
she
in
love
with
you
ask
her
said
vernon
feeling
like
a
schoolboy
in
an
examination
if
she
were
and
you
cared
for
her
then
you
and
i
could
be
friends
i
should
like
to
be
real
friends
with
you
let
us
be
friends
said
he
when
he
had
paused
a
moment
he
made
the
proposal
with
every
possible
reservation
really
she
said
i
so
glad
if
there
was
a
pang
betty
pretended
to
herself
that
there
was
none
if
vernon
conscience
fluttered
him
he
was
able
to
soothe
it
it
was
an
art
that
he
had
studied
for
years
say
you
two
the
voice
of
miss
voscoe
fell
like
a
pebble
into
the
pool
of
silence
that
was
slowly
widening
between
them
say
we
going
to
start
a
for
really
reliable
girls
we
can
have
it
here
and
it
only
be
one
franc
an
hour
for
the
model
and
say
six
sous
each
for
tea
two
afternoons
a
week
three
five
nine
of
us
you
join
miss
desmond
yes
oh
yes
said
betty
conscientiously
delighted
with
the
idea
of
more
work
that
makes
nine
six
sous
and
two
hours
model
how
much
is
that
mr
temple
i
see
it
written
on
your
speaking
brow
that
you
took
the
mathematical
wranglership
at
oxford
college
four
francs
seventy
said
temple
through
the
shout
of
laughter
have
i
said
something
comme
il
ne
faut
pas
said
miss
voscoe
you
could
said
vernon
every
word
leaves
your
lips
without
a
stain
upon
its
character
wo
you
let
us
join
asked
an
irish
student
you
be
lost
entirely
without
a
lord
of
creation
to
sharpen
your
pencils
we
mean
to
said
miss
voscoe
if
you
want
to
work
take
a
box
of
matches
and
a
couple
of
sticks
of
brimstone
and
make
a
little
sketch
class
of
your
own
i
do
see
what
you
want
with
models
said
a
very
young
and
shy
boy
student
could
you
pose
for
each
other
and
a
murmur
of
dissent
from
the
others
drove
him
back
into
shy
silence
no
amateur
models
in
this
academy
said
miss
voscoe
oh
we
make
the
institutions
sit
up
with
the
work
we
do
all
pledge
ourselves
to
send
in
to
the
salon
or
anyway
to
the
indépendants
what
we
suffering
from
in
this
why
should
we
be
contented
to
be
nobody
on
the
contrary
said
vernon
miss
voscoe
is
everybody
almost
i
the
nobody
who
ca
get
a
word
in
edgeways
anyhow
she
said
what
i
been
trying
to
say
ever
since
i
was
born
pretty
near
is
that
what
this
class
wants
is
a
competent
professor
some
bully
artist
to
come
and
pull
our
work
all
to
pieces
and
wipe
his
boots
on
the
bits
vernon
do
you
know
any
one
pining
to
give
us
free
crits
temple
is
said
vernon
there
no
mistaking
that
longing
glance
of
his
as
a
competent
professor
i
make
you
my
bow
of
gratitude
said
temple
but
i
should
never
have
the
courage
to
criticise
the
work
of
nine
fair
ladies
you
need
criticise
them
all
at
once
said
a
large
girl
from
minneapolis
nor
yet
all
in
the
gaudy
eye
of
heaven
we
screen
off
a
corner
for
our
professor
sort
of
confessional
business
you
sit
there
and
we
go
to
you
one
by
one
with
our
sins
in
our
hand
would
scare
him
some
i
surmise
said
miss
voscoe
not
at
all
said
temple
a
little
nettled
he
hardly
knew
why
i
did
know
you
were
so
brave
said
the
minneapolis
girl
perhaps
he
did
want
you
to
know
said
miss
voscoe
perhaps
that
his
life
dark
secret
people
often
pretend
to
a
courage
that
they
have
said
vernon
a
consistent
pose
of
cowardice
that
would
be
novel
and
i
see
the
idea
developing
more
than
useful
is
that
pose
asked
temple
still
rather
tartly
because
if
it
is
i
beg
to
offer
you
in
the
name
of
these
ladies
the
chair
of
i
not
afraid
of
the
nine
muses
vernon
laughed
back
as
long
as
they
are
nine
it
the
light
that
lies
in
woman
eyes
that
always
had
such
a
nervous
dread
of
it
does
make
you
blink
bless
it
said
the
irish
student
but
not
from
nine
pairs
at
once
as
you
say
it
the
light
from
one
pair
that
turns
your
head
vernon
is
weak
in
the
head
said
the
shy
boy
suddenly
no
said
vernon
it
the
heart
that
weak
with
me
i
have
to
be
very
careful
of
it
well
but
will
you
said
a
downright
girl
will
i
what
i
sorry
but
i
lost
my
cue
i
think
where
were
we
at
losing
hearts
was
it
no
said
the
downright
girl
i
did
mean
that
i
mean
will
you
come
and
criticise
our
drawings
fiddle
said
miss
voscoe
luminously
vernon
too
big
for
that
oh
well
said
vernon
if
you
do
think
i
should
be
competent
you
do
mean
to
say
you
would
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
playing
apollo
to
the
fairest
set
of
muses
in
the
quartier
said
temple
but
after
all
i
had
the
refusal
of
the
situation
i
wo
renounce
bobby
you
unman
me
interrupted
vernon
putting
down
his
cup
you
shall
renounce
the
altruistic
pleasure
which
you
promise
to
yourself
in
yielding
this
professorship
to
me
i
accept
it
i
hanged
if
you
do
said
temple
you
proposed
me
yourself
and
i
elected
are
i
miss
voscoe
that
so
said
she
but
vernon
president
too
i
long
been
struggling
with
the
conviction
that
temple
and
i
were
as
brothers
now
i
yield
temple
to
my
arms
they
embraced
elegantly
enthusiastically
almost
as
frenchmen
use
and
the
room
applauded
the
faithful
burlesque
what
come
to
me
that
i
should
play
the
goat
like
this
vernon
asked
himself
as
he
raised
his
head
from
temple
broad
shoulder
then
he
met
betty
laughing
eyes
and
no
longer
regretted
his
assumption
of
that
difficult
role
it
settled
then
tuesdays
and
fridays
four
to
six
he
said
at
last
i
am
to
be
the
light
of
the
harem
said
miss
voscoe
can
there
be
two
lights
asked
temple
anxiously
if
not
consider
the
fraternal
embrace
withdrawn
no
you
light
of
course
said
betty
vernon
the
ancient
light
he
older
than
you
are
is
he
the
roar
of
appreciation
of
her
little
joke
surprised
betty
and
a
little
pleased
her
till
miss
voscoe
whispered
under
cover
of
it
light
then
he
the
man
betty
explained
her
little
jest
all
the
same
said
the
other
it
was
any
old
blank
walls
you
were
thinking
about
i
believe
he
is
the
one
it
a
great
thing
to
be
able
to
believe
anything
said
betty
and
the
talk
broke
up
into
duets
she
found
that
temple
was
speaking
to
her
i
came
here
because
i
wanted
to
meet
you
miss
desmond
he
was
saying
i
hope
you
do
think
it
cheek
of
me
to
say
it
but
there
something
about
you
that
reminds
me
of
the
country
at
home
that
a
very
pretty
speech
said
betty
he
reminded
her
of
the
café
but
she
did
not
say
so
you
remind
me
of
a
garden
he
went
on
but
i
do
like
to
see
a
garden
without
a
hedge
round
it
you
think
i
ought
to
have
a
chaperon
said
betty
bravely
but
chaperons
are
needed
in
this
quarter
i
wish
i
were
your
brother
said
temple
i
so
glad
you
not
said
betty
she
wanted
no
chaperonage
even
fraternal
but
the
words
made
him
shrink
and
then
sent
a
soft
warmth
through
him
on
the
whole
he
was
not
sorry
that
he
was
not
her
brother
at
parting
vernon
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
said
and
when
may
i
see
you
again
on
tuesday
when
the
class
meets
but
i
did
mean
when
shall
i
see
the
class
when
shall
i
see
miss
desmond
oh
whenever
you
like
betty
answered
gaily
whenever
lady
craye
can
spare
you
he
let
her
say
it
chapter
xvi
love
and
tupper
whenever
vernon
liked
proved
to
be
the
very
next
day
he
was
waiting
outside
the
door
of
the
atelier
when
betty
in
pinafore
left
the
afternoon
class
wo
you
dine
with
me
somewhere
said
he
i
am
going
to
garnier
she
said
not
even
for
him
friend
of
hers
and
affianced
of
another
as
he
might
be
would
she
yet
break
the
rule
of
a
life
paula
had
instituted
fallen
as
i
am
he
answered
gaily
i
am
not
yet
so
low
as
to
be
incapable
of
dining
at
garnier
so
when
betty
passed
through
the
outer
room
of
the
restaurant
and
along
the
narrow
little
passage
where
eyes
and
nose
attest
strongly
the
neighborhood
of
the
kitchen
she
was
attended
by
a
figure
that
aroused
the
spontaneous
envy
of
all
her
acquaintances
in
the
inner
room
where
they
dined
it
was
remarked
that
such
a
figure
would
be
more
at
home
at
durand
or
the
café
de
paris
than
at
garnier
that
night
the
first
breath
of
criticism
assailed
betty
to
afficher
oneself
with
a
a
type
polish
or
otherwise
that
was
all
very
well
but
with
an
obvious
boulevardier
a
creature
from
the
other
side
this
dashed
itself
against
the
conventions
of
the
artistic
quartier
and
conventions
even
of
such
quarters
are
said
miss
voscoe
to
her
companions
shocked
comments
they
were
raised
in
the
same
village
or
something
he
used
to
give
her
peanuts
when
he
was
in
short
jackets
and
she
used
to
halve
her
candies
with
him
friend
of
childhood
hour
that
all
and
besides
he
one
of
the
presidents
of
our
sketch
club
but
all
garnier
marked
that
whereas
the
habitués
contented
themselves
with
an
omelette
aux
champignons
sauté
potatoes
and
a
petit
suisse
or
the
like
modest
menu
betty
new
friend
ordered
for
himself
and
for
her
a
real
regular
dinner
beginning
with
hors
and
ending
with
mendiants
mendiants
are
raisins
and
nuts
the
nearest
to
dessert
that
at
this
season
you
could
get
at
garniers
also
he
passed
over
with
smiling
disrelish
the
little
carafons
of
weak
wine
for
which
one
pays
five
sous
if
the
wine
be
red
and
six
if
it
be
white
he
went
out
and
interviewed
madame
at
her
little
desk
among
the
flowers
and
nuts
and
special
sweet
dishes
and
it
was
a
bottle
of
real
wine
with
a
real
cork
to
be
drawn
that
adorned
the
table
between
him
and
betty
to
her
the
whole
thing
was
of
the
nature
of
a
festival
she
enjoyed
the
little
sensation
created
by
her
companion
and
the
knowledge
which
she
thought
she
had
of
his
relations
to
lady
craye
absolved
her
of
any
fear
that
in
dining
with
him
she
was
doing
anything
not
quite
nice
to
her
the
thought
of
his
engagement
was
as
good
or
as
bad
as
a
chaperon
for
betty
innocence
was
deeply
laid
and
had
survived
the
shock
of
all
the
waves
that
had
beaten
against
it
since
her
coming
to
paris
it
was
more
than
innocence
it
was
a
very
honest
straightforward
childish
naiveté
it
almost
the
same
as
if
he
was
married
she
said
there
ca
be
any
harm
in
having
dinner
with
a
man
who
married
or
almost
married
so
she
enjoyed
herself
vernon
exerted
himself
to
amuse
her
but
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
not
so
happy
as
he
had
expected
to
be
it
was
good
that
betty
had
permitted
him
to
dine
with
her
alone
but
it
was
flat
after
dinner
he
took
her
to
the
odeon
and
she
said
to
him
with
a
lighter
heart
than
she
had
known
since
paula
left
her
in
these
rooms
now
sometimes
it
was
hard
to
keep
one
eyes
shut
and
to
keep
her
eyes
shut
was
now
betty
aim
in
life
even
more
than
the
art
for
which
she
pretended
to
herself
that
she
lived
for
now
that
paula
had
gone
the
deception
of
her
father
would
have
seemed
less
justifiable
had
she
ever
allowed
herself
to
face
the
thought
of
it
for
more
than
a
moment
but
she
used
to
fly
the
thought
and
go
round
to
one
of
the
girls
rooms
to
talk
about
art
with
a
big
a
and
forget
how
little
she
liked
or
admired
betty
desmond
she
was
now
one
of
a
circle
of
english
american
and
german
students
the
sketch
club
had
brought
her
eight
new
friends
and
they
went
about
in
parties
by
twos
and
threes
or
even
sevens
and
eights
and
betty
went
with
them
enjoying
the
fun
of
it
all
which
she
liked
and
missing
all
that
she
would
not
have
liked
if
she
had
seen
it
but
vernon
was
the
only
man
with
whom
she
dined
or
went
to
the
theatre
alone
to
him
the
winter
passed
in
a
maze
of
doubt
and
he
could
not
take
what
the
gods
held
out
could
not
draw
from
his
constant
companionship
of
betty
the
pleasure
which
his
artistic
principles
his
trained
instincts
taught
him
to
expect
he
had
now
all
the
he
cared
to
ask
for
and
he
hated
that
it
should
be
so
he
almost
wanted
her
to
be
in
a
position
where
such
things
should
be
impossible
to
her
he
wanted
her
to
be
guarded
watched
sheltered
and
he
had
never
wanted
that
for
any
woman
in
his
life
before
i
shall
be
wishing
her
in
a
convent
next
he
said
with
high
walls
with
spikes
on
the
top
then
i
should
walk
round
and
round
the
outside
of
the
walls
and
wish
her
out
but
i
should
not
be
able
to
get
at
her
and
nothing
else
would
either
lady
craye
was
more
charming
than
ever
vernon
knew
it
and
sometimes
he
deliberately
tried
to
let
her
charm
him
but
though
he
perceived
her
charm
he
could
not
feel
it
always
before
he
had
felt
what
he
chose
to
feel
or
perhaps
he
hated
the
thought
and
would
not
look
at
it
perhaps
all
his
love
affairs
had
been
just
pictures
perhaps
he
had
never
felt
anything
but
an
artistic
pleasure
in
their
grouping
and
lighting
perhaps
now
he
was
really
feeling
natural
human
emotion
did
they
call
it
but
that
was
just
it
he
was
what
he
felt
was
resentment
dissatisfaction
a
growing
inability
to
control
events
or
to
prearrange
his
sensations
he
felt
that
he
himself
was
controlled
he
felt
like
a
wild
creature
caught
in
a
trap
the
trap
was
not
gilded
and
he
was
very
uncomfortable
in
it
even
the
affairs
of
others
almost
ceased
to
amuse
him
he
could
hardly
call
up
a
cynical
smile
at
lady
craye
evident
misapprehension
of
those
conscientious
efforts
of
his
to
be
charmed
by
her
he
was
only
moved
to
a
very
faint
amusement
when
one
day
bobbie
temple
smoking
in
the
studio
broke
a
long
silence
abruptly
to
say
look
here
someone
was
saying
the
other
day
that
a
man
can
be
in
love
with
two
women
at
a
time
do
you
think
it
true
two
yes
or
twenty
then
it
not
love
said
temple
wisely
they
call
it
love
said
vernon
do
know
what
they
mean
by
it
what
do
mean
by
love
yes
i
do
exactly
know
said
temple
slowly
i
suppose
it
wanting
to
be
with
a
person
and
thinking
about
nothing
else
and
thinking
they
the
most
beautiful
and
all
that
and
going
over
everything
that
they
ever
said
to
you
and
wanting
wanting
well
i
suppose
if
it
really
love
you
want
to
marry
them
you
ca
marry
you
know
said
vernon
at
least
not
simultaneously
that
just
it
well
well
that
all
if
that
not
love
what
is
i
hanged
if
know
said
vernon
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
those
sort
of
things
so
did
i
said
vernon
to
himself
aloud
he
said
if
you
want
a
philosophic
definition
it
passion
transfigured
by
tenderness
at
least
i
often
said
so
but
can
you
feel
that
for
two
people
at
once
or
said
vernon
getting
interested
in
his
words
it
tenderness
intoxicated
by
passion
and
not
knowing
that
it
drunk
but
can
you
feel
that
for
two
oh
bother
said
vernon
every
sort
of
calls
itself
love
there
the
pleasure
of
pursuit
there
vanity
there
the
satisfaction
of
your
own
there
desire
intellectual
attraction
there
the
love
of
beauty
there
the
artist
joy
in
doing
what
you
know
you
can
do
well
and
getting
a
pretty
woman
for
sole
audience
you
might
feel
one
or
two
or
twenty
of
these
things
for
one
woman
and
one
or
two
or
twenty
different
ones
for
another
but
if
you
mean
do
you
love
two
women
in
the
same
way
i
say
no
thank
heaven
it
new
every
time
it
may
be
the
same
way
said
temple
but
it
the
same
thing
to
you
if
you
feel
you
ca
bear
to
give
either
of
them
up
well
then
you
can
marry
one
and
keep
on
with
the
other
or
be
with
both
and
marry
neither
or
cut
the
whole
show
and
go
to
the
colonies
then
you
have
to
choose
between
being
unhappy
or
being
a
blackguard
my
good
chap
that
the
situation
in
which
our
emotions
are
always
landing
us
our
confounded
emotions
and
the
conventions
of
society
and
how
are
you
to
know
whether
the
thing
love
or
all
those
other
things
you
do
know
you
ca
know
till
it
too
late
for
your
knowing
to
matter
marriage
is
like
spinach
you
ca
tell
that
you
hate
it
till
you
tried
it
only
well
i
think
i
heard
it
said
vernon
voiced
his
own
sudden
conviction
very
carelessly
that
love
wants
to
give
and
passion
wants
to
take
love
wants
to
possess
the
beloved
object
and
to
make
her
happy
desire
wants
possession
too
but
the
happiness
is
to
be
for
oneself
and
if
there
not
enough
happiness
for
both
so
much
the
worse
if
talking
like
a
sunday
school
book
you
brought
it
on
yourself
i
like
it
said
temple
well
since
the
dissenting
surplice
has
fallen
on
me
i
give
you
a
test
i
believe
that
the
more
you
love
a
woman
the
less
your
thoughts
will
dwell
on
the
physical
side
of
the
business
you
want
to
take
care
of
her
yes
said
temple
and
then
often
vernon
went
on
surprised
to
find
that
he
wanted
to
help
the
other
in
his
if
a
chap
not
had
much
to
do
with
women
the
women
of
our
class
i
mean
he
gets
a
bit
dazed
with
them
they
all
so
nice
confound
them
if
a
man
felt
he
was
falling
in
love
with
two
women
at
once
and
he
had
the
tiresome
temperament
that
takes
these
things
seriously
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
him
to
go
away
into
the
country
and
moon
about
for
a
few
weeks
and
see
which
was
the
one
that
bothered
his
brain
most
then
he
know
where
he
was
and
not
be
led
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
by
the
wrong
one
they
ca
both
get
him
you
know
unless
his
intentions
are
strictly
dishonourable
i
was
putting
the
case
that
either
of
them
wished
to
get
him
said
temple
carefully
vernon
nodded
of
course
not
the
thing
simplifies
itself
wonderfully
if
neither
of
them
wants
to
get
him
even
if
they
both
do
matters
are
less
complicated
it
when
only
one
of
them
wants
him
that
it
the
very
devil
for
a
man
not
to
be
sure
what
wants
that
very
clumsily
put
what
i
mean
is
i
see
what
you
mean
said
temple
it
the
devil
for
him
because
then
he
lets
himself
drift
and
the
one
who
wants
him
collars
him
and
then
of
course
she
always
turns
out
to
be
the
one
he
did
want
my
observations
are
as
full
of
wants
as
an
advertisement
column
but
the
thing
to
do
in
all
relations
of
life
is
to
make
up
your
mind
what
it
is
that
you
want
and
then
to
jolly
well
see
that
you
get
it
what
i
want
is
a
pipe
he
filled
and
lighted
one
you
talk
said
temple
slowly
as
though
a
man
could
get
anyone
i
mean
anything
he
wanted
so
he
can
my
dear
chap
if
he
only
wants
her
badly
enough
badly
enough
badly
enough
to
make
the
supreme
sacrifice
to
get
her
temple
enquired
marriage
vernon
answered
there
only
one
excuse
for
marriage
excuse
excuse
and
that
excuse
is
that
one
could
help
it
the
only
excuse
one
will
have
to
offer
some
day
to
the
recording
angel
for
all
one
other
faults
and
follies
a
man
who
help
getting
married
and
does
deserves
all
he
gets
i
do
agree
with
you
in
the
least
said
temple
about
marriage
i
mean
a
man
to
want
to
get
married
to
anybody
without
its
being
anybody
in
particular
yes
said
temple
stoutly
if
he
gets
to
thirty
without
wanting
to
marry
any
one
in
particular
he
ought
to
look
about
till
he
finds
some
one
he
does
want
it
the
right
and
proper
thing
to
marry
and
have
kiddies
oh
if
you
going
to
be
patriarchal
said
vernon
what
a
symbolic
dialogue
we
begin
with
love
and
we
end
with
marriage
there
the
tragedy
of
romance
in
a
yes
life
a
beastly
rotten
show
and
the
light
wo
last
more
than
another
two
hours
illustration
unfinished
but
a
disquieting
likeness
your
hints
are
always
as
delicate
as
gossamer
said
temple
throw
anything
at
me
i
going
he
went
leaving
his
secret
in
vernon
hands
poor
old
temple
that
the
worst
of
walking
carefully
all
your
days
you
do
come
such
an
awful
cropper
when
you
do
come
one
two
women
the
jasmine
lady
must
have
been
practising
on
his
poor
little
heart
i
wish
she
could
do
as
much
for
me
and
the
other
one
i
suppose
the
use
of
the
pronoun
the
disuse
of
the
grammar
pulled
him
up
short
by
jove
he
said
that
what
people
say
when
but
i
not
in
love
with
anybody
i
want
to
work
but
he
did
work
he
seldom
did
now
and
when
he
did
the
work
was
not
good
his
easel
held
most
often
the
portrait
of
betty
that
had
been
begun
at
long
barton
unfinished
but
a
disquieting
likeness
he
walked
up
and
down
his
room
not
thinking
but
dreaming
his
dreams
took
him
to
the
warren
in
the
pure
morning
light
he
saw
betty
he
told
himself
what
he
had
said
what
she
had
said
and
it
was
i
who
advised
her
to
come
to
paris
if
only
i
known
then
he
stopped
and
asked
himself
what
he
knew
now
that
he
had
not
known
then
refused
himself
the
answer
and
went
to
call
on
lady
craye
christmas
came
and
went
the
black
winds
of
january
swept
the
boulevards
and
snow
lay
white
on
the
walls
of
court
and
garden
betty
life
was
full
now
the
empty
cage
that
had
opened
its
door
to
love
at
long
barton
had
now
other
occupants
ambition
was
beginning
to
grow
its
wing
feathers
she
could
draw
at
least
some
day
she
would
be
able
to
draw
already
she
had
won
a
prize
with
a
charcoal
study
of
a
bare
back
but
she
did
not
dare
to
name
this
to
her
father
and
when
he
wrote
to
ask
what
was
the
subject
of
her
prize
drawing
she
replied
with
misleading
truth
that
it
was
a
study
from
nature
his
imagination
pictured
a
rustic
cottage
a
a
castle
and
mountains
in
the
distance
and
cows
and
a
peasant
in
the
foreground
but
though
her
life
was
now
crowded
with
new
interests
that
was
not
ousted
only
he
had
changed
his
plumage
and
she
called
him
friendship
she
blushed
sometimes
and
stamped
her
foot
when
she
remembered
those
meetings
in
the
summer
mornings
her
tremors
her
and
oh
the
drivel
she
had
written
in
her
diary
girls
ought
never
to
be
allowed
to
lead
that
home
life
she
said
to
miss
voscoe
with
nothing
real
in
it
it
makes
your
mind
all
swept
and
garnished
and
then
you
hurry
to
fill
it
up
with
rubbish
that
so
said
her
friend
if
ever
have
a
daughter
said
betty
she
shall
set
to
work
at
definite
the
very
instant
she
leaves
school
if
it
only
hebrew
or
algebra
not
just
parish
duties
that
she
did
begin
and
does
want
to
go
on
with
but
something
that
her
work
you
beginning
to
see
straight
i
surmised
you
would
by
and
by
but
do
you
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
miss
what
do
you
mean
asked
betty
it
was
the
morning
interval
when
students
eat
patisserie
out
of
folded
papers
the
two
were
on
the
window
ledge
of
the
atelier
looking
down
on
the
convent
garden
where
already
the
buds
were
breaking
to
green
leaf
why
there
room
for
the
devil
even
if
your
flat
ai
swept
and
garnished
he
folds
up
mighty
small
and
gets
into
less
space
than
a
what
do
you
mean
asked
betty
again
i
mean
that
vernon
chap
said
miss
voscoe
i
told
you
to
change
partners
every
now
and
then
but
with
you
it
that
vernon
this
week
and
last
week
and
the
week
after
next
i
known
him
longer
than
i
have
the
others
and
i
like
him
said
betty
oh
he
all
right
fine
and
dandy
replied
miss
voscoe
he
a
big
man
too
in
his
own
line
not
the
kind
you
expect
to
see
knocking
about
at
a
students
crémerie
does
he
give
you
lessons
he
did
at
home
said
betty
take
care
he
does
teach
you
what
the
easiest
thing
in
creation
to
learn
about
a
man
what
that
betty
did
not
like
to
have
to
ask
the
question
why
how
not
to
be
able
to
do
without
him
of
course
said
miss
voscoe
you
quite
mistaken
said
betty
eagerly
one
of
the
reasons
i
do
mind
going
about
with
him
so
much
is
that
he
engaged
to
be
married
acquainted
with
the
lady
yes
said
betty
sheltering
behind
the
convention
that
an
introduction
at
a
constitutes
acquaintanceship
she
was
glad
miss
voscoe
had
not
asked
her
if
she
lady
craye
oh
well
miss
voscoe
jumped
up
and
shook
the
flakes
of
pastry
off
her
pinafore
if
she
does
mind
i
guess
i
got
no
call
to
but
why
do
you
give
that
saint
in
the
collar
a
turn
meaning
temple
he
admires
you
no
end
he
be
always
in
your
pocket
if
you
let
him
he
worth
fifty
of
the
other
man
a
man
if
he
is
as
an
artist
i
keep
my
eyes
skinned
and
the
sketch
club
gives
me
a
chance
to
tot
them
both
up
i
guess
i
can
size
up
a
man
some
the
other
man
is
that
how
it
strikes
me
fast
echoed
betty
bewildered
fast
dye
fast
colour
i
suspicion
he
go
wrong
a
bit
in
the
temple
fast
colour
warranted
not
to
run
i
know
said
betty
but
i
do
care
for
the
colour
and
i
rather
tired
of
the
pattern
i
wish
you
tell
me
which
of
the
two
was
the
man
i
know
you
do
but
surely
you
see
you
too
cute
just
as
likely
it
the
temple
one
and
that
why
you
so
sick
of
the
pattern
by
now
did
i
tell
you
you
were
clever
laughed
betty
but
all
the
same
next
evening
when
vernon
called
to
take
her
to
dinner
she
said
could
we
go
somewhere
else
i
tired
of
garnier
vernon
was
tired
of
garnier
too
do
you
know
thirion
he
said
thirion
in
the
boulevard
germain
thirion
where
du
maurier
used
to
go
and
thackeray
and
all
sorts
of
celebrated
people
and
where
the
host
treats
you
like
a
friend
and
the
waiter
like
a
brother
i
should
love
to
be
treated
like
a
waiter
brother
do
let
go
said
betty
he
a
dream
of
a
waiter
vernon
went
on
as
they
turned
down
the
lighted
slope
of
the
rue
de
rennes
has
a
voice
like
a
trumpet
and
takes
a
pride
in
calling
twenty
orders
down
the
in
one
breath
ending
up
with
a
shout
he
never
makes
a
mistake
either
shall
we
walk
or
take
the
tram
or
a
carriage
the
fate
who
was
amusing
herself
by
playing
with
betty
destiny
had
sent
temple
to
call
on
lady
craye
that
afternoon
and
lady
craye
had
seemed
bored
so
bored
that
she
had
hardly
appeared
to
listen
to
temple
talk
which
duly
directed
by
her
quite
early
into
the
channel
she
desired
for
it
flowed
in
a
constant
stream
over
the
name
the
history
the
work
the
personality
of
vernon
when
at
last
the
stream
ebbed
lady
craye
made
a
pretty
feint
of
stifling
a
yawn
oh
how
horrid
i
am
she
cried
with
instant
penitence
and
how
very
rude
you
will
think
me
i
think
i
have
the
blues
or
to
be
more
french
and
more
poetic
the
black
butterflies
it
so
sweet
of
you
to
have
let
me
talk
to
you
i
know
i
been
as
stupid
as
an
owl
wo
you
stay
and
dine
with
me
i
promise
to
cheer
up
if
you
will
temple
would
more
than
gladly
or
no
lady
craye
went
on
that
be
dull
for
you
and
perhaps
even
for
me
if
i
begin
to
think
i
boring
you
could
we
do
something
desperate
dine
at
a
latin
quarter
restaurant
for
instance
what
was
that
place
you
were
telling
me
of
where
the
waiter
has
a
wonderful
voice
and
makes
the
orders
he
shouts
down
the
tube
sound
like
the
recitative
of
the
basso
at
the
opera
thirion
said
temple
but
it
was
i
it
was
vernon
thirion
that
it
lady
craye
broke
in
before
vernon
name
left
his
lips
would
you
like
to
take
me
there
to
dine
mr
temple
it
appeared
that
temple
would
like
it
of
all
things
then
i
go
and
put
on
my
hat
said
she
and
trailed
her
across
the
room
at
the
door
she
turned
to
say
it
will
be
fun
wo
it
and
to
laugh
delightedly
like
a
child
who
is
promised
a
treat
that
was
how
it
happened
that
lady
craye
brushing
her
dark
furs
against
the
wall
of
thirion
staircase
came
followed
by
temple
into
the
room
where
betty
and
vernon
their
heads
rather
close
together
were
discussing
the
menu
this
was
what
lady
craye
had
thought
of
more
than
a
little
yet
it
was
not
what
she
had
expected
vernon
perhaps
yes
or
the
girl
but
not
vernon
and
the
girl
together
not
now
at
her
very
first
visit
it
was
not
for
a
second
that
she
hesitated
temple
had
not
even
had
time
to
see
who
it
was
to
whom
she
spoke
before
she
had
walked
over
to
the
two
and
greeted
them
how
perfectly
delightful
she
said
miss
desmond
i
been
meaning
to
call
on
you
but
it
been
so
cold
and
i
been
so
cross
called
on
nobody
ah
vernon
you
too
she
looked
at
the
vacant
chair
near
his
and
vernon
had
to
say
you
join
us
of
course
so
the
two
little
parties
made
one
party
and
one
of
the
party
was
angry
and
annoyed
and
no
one
of
the
party
was
quite
pleased
and
all
four
concealed
what
they
felt
and
affected
what
they
did
not
feel
with
as
much
of
the
tact
of
the
truly
as
each
could
call
up
in
this
polite
exercise
lady
craye
was
easily
first
she
was
charming
to
temple
she
was
very
nice
to
betty
and
she
spoke
to
vernon
with
a
delicate
subtle
faint
suggestion
of
proprietorship
in
her
tone
at
least
that
was
how
it
seemed
to
betty
to
temple
it
seemed
that
she
was
tacitly
apologising
to
an
old
friend
for
having
involuntarily
broken
up
a
dinner
à
deux
to
vernon
her
tone
seemed
to
spell
out
an
all
but
overmastering
jealousy
proudly
overmastered
all
that
pretty
fiction
of
there
being
now
no
possibility
of
sentiment
between
him
and
her
flickered
down
and
died
and
with
it
the
interest
that
he
had
felt
in
her
have
unexplored
reserves
bah
he
told
himself
she
is
just
like
the
rest
he
felt
that
she
had
not
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
just
to
dine
with
temple
he
knew
she
had
been
looking
for
him
and
the
temptation
assailed
him
to
reward
her
tender
anxiety
by
devoting
himself
wholly
to
betty
then
he
remembered
what
he
had
let
betty
believe
as
to
the
relations
in
which
he
stood
to
this
other
woman
his
face
lighted
up
with
a
smile
of
answering
tenderness
without
neglecting
betty
he
seemed
to
lay
the
real
homage
of
his
heart
at
the
feet
of
that
heart
lady
by
jove
he
thought
as
the
dark
beautiful
eyes
met
his
in
a
look
of
more
tenderness
than
he
had
seen
in
them
this
many
a
day
if
only
she
knew
how
she
playing
my
game
for
me
betty
for
her
part
refused
to
recognise
a
little
pain
that
gnawed
at
her
heart
and
stole
all
taste
from
the
best
dishes
of
thirion
she
talked
as
much
as
possible
to
temple
because
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
she
told
herself
and
she
talked
very
badly
lady
craye
was
transfigured
by
vernon
unexpected
acceptance
of
her
delicate
advances
intoxicated
by
the
sudden
flutter
of
a
dream
she
had
only
known
with
wings
in
full
flight
into
the
region
where
dreams
clasped
to
the
heart
become
realities
she
grew
momently
more
beautiful
the
host
going
from
table
to
table
talking
easily
to
his
guests
could
not
keep
his
fascinated
eyes
from
her
face
the
proprietor
of
thirion
had
good
taste
and
knew
a
beautiful
woman
when
he
saw
her
betty
eyes
too
strayed
more
and
more
often
from
her
plate
and
from
temple
to
the
efflorescence
of
this
new
she
felt
mean
and
poor
shabby
dowdy
dull
weary
and
uninteresting
her
face
felt
tired
it
was
an
effort
to
smile
when
the
dinner
was
over
she
said
abruptly
if
you
excuse
me
i
got
a
dreadful
headache
no
i
do
want
anyone
to
see
me
home
just
put
me
in
a
carriage
she
insisted
and
it
was
done
when
the
carriage
drew
up
in
front
of
the
closed
porte
cochère
of
boulevard
montparnasse
betty
was
surprised
and
wounded
to
discover
that
she
was
crying
well
you
they
were
engaged
she
said
as
she
let
herself
into
her
room
with
her
latchkey
you
knew
they
were
engaged
what
did
you
expect
temple
could
not
remember
afterwards
exactly
how
he
got
separated
from
the
others
it
just
happened
as
such
unimportant
things
will
he
missed
them
somehow
at
a
crossing
looked
about
him
in
vain
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
home
lady
craye
hesitated
a
moment
with
her
latchkey
in
her
hand
then
she
threw
open
the
door
of
her
flat
come
in
wo
you
she
said
and
led
the
way
into
her
lamplit
room
vernon
also
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
followed
he
stood
on
the
with
his
back
to
the
wood
fire
he
did
not
speak
somehow
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
take
up
their
talk
at
the
place
and
in
the
strain
where
it
had
broken
off
when
betty
proclaimed
her
headache
yet
this
was
what
she
must
do
it
seemed
to
her
or
lose
all
the
ground
she
had
gained
you
been
very
charming
to
me
this
evening
she
said
at
last
and
knew
as
she
said
it
that
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say
you
flatter
me
said
vernon
i
was
so
surprised
to
see
you
there
she
went
on
vernon
was
surprised
that
she
should
say
it
he
had
thought
more
highly
of
her
powers
the
pleasure
was
mine
he
said
in
his
most
banal
tones
the
surprise
alas
was
all
for
you
and
all
you
gained
were
surprised
lady
craye
was
angry
and
humiliated
that
she
she
should
find
herself
nervous
at
fault
find
herself
playing
the
game
as
crudely
as
any
shopgirl
no
said
vernon
but
you
could
have
expected
me
she
knew
quite
well
what
she
was
doing
but
she
was
too
nervous
to
stop
herself
i
always
expected
you
he
said
deliberately
ever
since
i
told
you
that
i
often
dined
at
thirion
you
expected
me
to
to
run
after
me
said
vernon
with
paraded
ingenuousness
yes
did
you
run
after
you
she
stopped
short
for
she
saw
in
his
eyes
that
if
she
let
him
quarrel
with
her
now
it
was
forever
he
at
the
same
moment
awoke
from
the
trance
of
anger
that
had
come
upon
him
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
her
anger
at
her
and
at
himself
fanned
to
fury
by
the
thought
of
betty
and
of
what
she
at
this
moment
must
be
thinking
he
laughed
ah
do
break
my
heart
he
said
i
been
so
happy
all
the
evening
fancying
that
you
had
you
had
had
what
she
asked
with
dry
lips
for
the
caress
in
his
tone
was
such
as
to
deceive
the
very
elect
had
felt
just
the
faintest
little
touch
of
interest
in
me
had
cared
to
know
how
i
spent
my
evenings
and
with
whom
you
thought
i
could
stoop
to
spy
on
you
she
asked
monsieur
flatters
himself
the
anger
in
him
was
raising
its
head
again
monsieur
very
seldom
does
he
said
she
took
that
as
she
chose
to
take
it
no
you
beautifully
humble
and
you
proudly
beautiful
she
flushed
and
looked
down
do
you
like
to
be
told
that
you
beautiful
not
by
you
not
like
that
and
so
you
did
come
to
thirion
to
see
me
how
one
may
deceive
oneself
the
highest
hopes
we
cherish
here
another
beautiful
illusion
gone
she
said
to
herself
i
can
do
nothing
with
him
in
this
mood
and
aloud
she
could
not
help
saying
was
it
a
beautiful
one
very
he
answered
gaily
can
you
doubt
it
she
found
nothing
to
say
and
even
as
she
fought
for
words
she
suddenly
found
that
he
had
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
that
the
sound
of
the
door
that
had
banged
behind
him
was
echoing
in
her
ears
she
put
her
hands
to
her
head
she
could
not
see
clearly
chapter
xvii
interventions
that
kiss
gave
lady
craye
furiously
to
think
as
they
say
in
france
had
it
meant
what
had
it
meant
was
it
the
crown
of
her
hopes
her
dreams
was
it
possible
that
now
at
last
after
all
that
had
gone
before
she
might
win
him
had
won
him
even
the
said
no
then
if
no
were
the
answer
to
that
question
the
kiss
had
been
mere
brutality
it
had
meant
just
you
chose
to
follow
me
to
play
the
spy
what
the
deuce
do
you
want
is
it
this
god
knows
you
welcome
the
kiss
following
the
kiss
stung
it
was
not
the
first
but
the
others
even
the
last
of
them
two
years
before
had
not
had
that
sting
lady
craye
biting
her
lips
in
lonely
dissection
of
herself
and
of
him
dared
take
no
comfort
also
she
no
longer
dared
to
follow
him
to
watch
him
to
spy
on
him
in
her
leisure
lady
craye
analysed
herself
and
him
and
her
above
all
her
who
was
betty
to
find
out
how
it
all
seemed
to
her
that
presently
seemed
to
lady
craye
the
one
possible
the
one
important
thing
so
after
she
had
given
a
few
days
to
the
analysis
of
that
kiss
had
failed
to
reach
certainty
as
to
its
elements
had
writhed
in
her
failure
and
bitterly
resented
the
mysteries
constituent
that
falsified
all
her
calculations
she
dressed
herself
beautifully
and
went
to
call
on
the
constituent
betty
betty
was
at
home
she
was
drawing
at
a
table
cunningly
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
window
she
rose
with
a
grace
that
lady
craye
had
not
seen
in
her
she
was
dressed
in
a
plain
gown
that
hung
from
the
shoulders
in
long
straight
green
folds
her
hair
was
and
betty
had
beautiful
hair
lady
craye
hair
had
never
been
long
betty
fell
nearly
to
her
knees
oh
was
the
door
open
she
said
i
did
know
i
i
so
sorry
i
been
washing
my
hair
it
lovely
said
the
other
woman
with
an
appreciation
quite
genuine
what
a
pity
you
ca
always
wear
it
like
that
it
long
said
betty
disparagingly
but
the
colour
horrid
what
miss
voscoe
calls
boy
colour
boy
colour
oh
just
nothing
in
particular
mousy
if
you
had
golden
hair
or
black
miss
desmond
you
have
a
quite
unfair
advantage
over
the
rest
of
us
i
do
think
so
said
betty
very
simply
you
see
no
one
ever
sees
it
down
what
a
charming
place
you
got
here
lady
craye
went
on
yes
said
betty
it
is
nice
and
she
thought
of
paula
and
do
you
live
here
all
alone
yes
i
had
a
friend
with
me
at
first
but
she
gone
back
to
england
do
you
find
it
very
dull
oh
no
i
know
lots
of
people
now
and
they
come
to
see
you
here
lady
craye
had
decided
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
delicately
the
girl
was
evidently
stupid
and
one
need
not
pick
one
words
yes
said
betty
vernon
a
great
friend
of
yours
is
he
yes
i
suppose
you
see
a
great
deal
of
him
yes
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
to
know
the
scratch
was
so
sudden
so
fierce
so
feline
that
for
a
moment
lady
craye
could
only
look
blankly
at
her
hostess
then
she
recovered
herself
enough
to
say
oh
i
so
sorry
was
i
asking
a
lot
of
questions
it
a
dreadful
habit
of
mine
i
afraid
when
i
interested
in
people
betty
scratched
again
quite
calmly
and
quite
mercilessly
it
quite
natural
that
vernon
should
interest
you
but
i
think
i
likely
to
be
able
to
tell
you
anything
about
him
that
you
do
know
may
i
get
you
some
tea
it
was
impossible
for
lady
craye
to
reply
i
meant
that
i
was
interested
in
not
in
vernon
so
she
said
thank
you
that
will
be
delightful
betty
went
along
the
little
passage
to
her
kitchen
and
her
visitor
was
left
to
revise
her
impressions
when
betty
came
back
with
the
her
hair
was
twisted
up
the
kettle
could
be
heard
hissing
in
the
tiny
kitchen
ca
i
help
you
lady
craye
asked
leaning
back
indolently
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
no
thank
you
it
all
done
now
illustration
thank
you
it
all
done
now
betty
poured
the
tea
for
the
other
woman
to
drink
her
own
remained
untasted
she
exerted
herself
to
manufacture
was
very
amiable
very
attentive
lady
craye
almost
thought
she
must
have
dreamed
those
two
sharp
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
but
presently
betty
polite
remarks
came
less
readily
there
were
longer
intervals
of
silence
and
lady
craye
for
once
was
at
a
loss
her
nerve
was
gone
she
dared
not
tempt
the
claws
again
after
the
longest
pause
of
all
betty
said
suddenly
i
think
i
know
why
you
came
i
came
to
see
you
because
you
a
friend
of
mr
vernon
you
came
to
see
me
because
you
wanted
to
find
out
exactly
how
much
i
a
friend
of
vernon
did
you
candour
is
the
most
disconcerting
of
the
virtues
not
in
the
least
lady
craye
found
herself
saying
i
came
to
see
you
because
as
i
said
i
do
think
it
is
much
use
your
coming
to
see
me
betty
went
on
though
if
you
meant
it
kindly
but
you
did
you
did
if
you
had
it
would
have
made
any
difference
we
should
never
get
on
with
each
other
never
really
miss
desmond
lady
craye
clutched
her
and
half
rose
i
begin
to
think
we
never
should
betty
ignorance
of
the
usages
of
good
society
stood
her
friend
she
ignored
not
consciously
but
by
the
prompting
of
nature
the
social
law
which
decrees
that
one
should
not
speak
of
things
that
really
interest
one
do
sit
down
she
said
i
glad
you
came
because
i
know
exactly
what
you
mean
now
if
the
knowledge
were
only
mutual
sighed
lady
craye
and
found
courage
to
raise
eyebrows
wearily
you
do
like
my
going
about
with
vernon
well
you
only
to
say
so
only
when
you
married
you
find
you
got
your
work
cut
out
to
keep
him
from
having
any
friends
except
you
lady
craye
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
believing
this
likely
to
be
the
truth
she
said
when
i
married
yes
said
betty
firmly
you
jealous
you
no
cause
to
be
and
i
tell
you
that
because
i
think
being
jealous
must
hurt
but
it
would
have
been
nicer
of
you
if
you
come
straight
to
me
and
said
here
i
do
like
you
going
about
with
the
man
i
engaged
to
i
should
have
understood
then
and
respected
you
but
to
come
like
a
child
guide
to
knowledge
the
other
woman
was
not
listening
engaged
to
him
the
words
sang
deliciously
disquietingly
in
her
ears
but
who
said
i
was
engaged
to
him
he
did
of
course
he
is
ashamed
of
it
if
you
are
he
told
you
that
yes
now
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
betty
braced
by
the
straightforward
directness
of
miss
voscoe
and
full
of
the
nervous
energy
engendered
by
a
trouble
had
routed
for
a
moment
the
woman
of
the
world
but
only
for
a
moment
then
lady
craye
unable
to
estimate
the
gain
or
loss
of
the
encounter
pulled
herself
together
to
make
good
her
retreat
yes
she
said
with
her
charming
smile
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
jealous
i
own
it
but
i
should
have
shown
it
as
i
did
if
known
the
sort
of
girl
you
are
come
forgive
me
ca
you
understand
and
forgive
it
was
all
my
fault
the
generosity
of
betty
hastened
to
meet
what
it
took
to
be
the
generosity
of
the
other
forgive
me
i
wo
see
him
again
at
all
if
you
do
want
me
to
no
no
even
at
that
moment
in
one
illuminating
flash
lady
craye
saw
the
explications
that
must
follow
the
announcement
of
that
renunciatory
decision
no
no
if
you
do
that
i
shall
feel
sure
that
you
do
forgive
me
for
being
so
silly
just
let
everything
go
on
wo
you
and
please
please
do
tell
him
anything
about
about
how
could
i
asked
betty
but
promise
you
wo
you
know
men
are
so
vain
i
should
hate
him
to
know
she
hesitated
and
then
finished
the
sentence
with
fine
art
to
know
how
much
i
care
of
course
you
care
said
betty
downrightly
you
ought
to
care
it
would
be
horrid
of
you
if
you
did
but
i
do
now
i
you
miss
desmond
i
understand
so
well
and
i
like
to
think
of
his
being
with
you
even
to
betty
ears
this
did
not
ring
quite
true
you
like
she
said
i
mean
i
quite
understand
now
i
thought
i
do
know
what
i
thought
you
so
pretty
you
know
and
he
has
had
so
very
many
he
has
one
with
me
said
betty
briefly
ah
you
still
angry
and
no
wonder
do
forgive
me
miss
desmond
and
let
be
friends
betty
look
as
she
gave
her
hand
was
doubtful
but
the
hand
was
given
and
you
keep
my
poor
little
secret
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
been
proud
for
him
to
know
how
much
you
care
ah
my
dear
lady
craye
became
natural
for
an
instant
under
the
transfiguring
influence
of
her
real
thoughts
as
she
spoke
them
my
dear
do
believe
it
when
a
man
sure
of
you
he
does
care
any
more
it
while
he
not
quite
sure
that
he
cares
i
do
think
that
so
always
said
betty
ah
believe
me
there
are
ways
of
killing
a
cat
than
choking
it
with
butter
forgive
the
homely
aphorism
when
you
have
a
lover
of
your
own
or
perhaps
you
have
now
perhaps
i
have
betty
stood
on
guard
with
a
steady
face
well
when
you
have
or
if
you
have
remember
never
to
let
him
be
quite
sure
it
the
only
way
the
two
parted
with
a
mutually
kindly
feeling
that
surprised
one
as
much
as
the
other
lady
craye
drove
home
contrasting
bitterly
the
excellence
of
her
maxims
with
the
ineptitude
of
her
practice
she
had
let
him
know
that
she
cared
and
he
had
left
her
that
was
two
years
ago
and
now
that
she
had
met
him
again
when
she
might
have
played
the
part
she
had
recommended
to
that
chit
with
the
long
hair
the
part
she
knew
to
be
the
wise
one
she
had
once
more
suffered
passion
to
overcome
wisdom
and
had
shown
him
that
she
loved
him
and
he
had
kissed
her
she
blushed
in
the
dusk
of
her
carriage
for
the
shame
of
that
kiss
but
he
had
told
that
girl
that
he
was
engaged
to
her
a
delicious
other
flush
replaced
the
blush
of
shame
why
should
he
have
done
that
unless
he
really
meant
in
that
case
the
kiss
was
nothing
to
blush
about
and
yet
it
was
she
knew
it
she
had
time
to
think
in
the
days
that
followed
days
that
brought
temple
more
than
once
to
her
doors
but
vernon
never
betty
left
alone
let
down
her
damp
hair
and
tried
to
resume
her
drawing
but
it
would
not
do
the
emotion
of
the
interview
was
too
recent
her
heart
was
beating
still
with
anger
and
resentment
and
other
feelings
less
easily
named
vernon
was
to
come
to
fetch
her
at
seven
she
would
not
face
him
let
him
go
and
dine
with
the
woman
he
belonged
to
betty
went
out
at
six
she
would
not
go
to
garnier
nor
to
thirion
that
was
where
he
would
look
for
her
she
walked
steadily
on
down
the
boulevard
she
would
dine
at
some
place
she
had
never
been
to
before
a
sickening
vision
of
that
first
night
in
paris
swam
before
her
she
saw
again
the
café
heard
the
voices
of
the
women
who
had
spoken
to
paula
saw
the
eyes
of
the
men
who
had
been
the
companions
of
those
women
in
that
rout
the
face
of
temple
shone
clear
cut
severe
she
remembered
the
instant
resentment
that
had
thrilled
her
at
his
protective
attitude
remembered
it
and
wondered
at
it
a
little
she
would
not
have
felt
that
now
she
knew
her
paris
better
than
she
had
done
then
and
with
the
thought
the
face
of
temple
came
towards
her
out
of
the
crowd
he
raised
his
hat
in
response
to
her
frigid
bow
and
had
almost
passed
her
when
she
spoke
on
an
impulse
that
surprised
herself
oh
mr
temple
he
stopped
and
turned
i
was
looking
for
a
place
to
dine
i
tired
of
garnier
and
thirion
he
hesitated
and
he
too
remembered
the
night
at
the
café
when
she
had
disdained
his
advice
and
gone
back
to
take
the
advice
of
paula
he
caught
himself
assuring
himself
that
a
man
need
not
be
ashamed
to
risk
being
snubbed
making
a
fool
of
himself
even
if
he
could
do
any
good
so
he
said
you
know
i
have
horrid
ideas
about
women
and
stopped
short
do
you
know
of
any
good
quiet
place
near
here
said
betty
i
think
women
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
but
some
of
them
miss
desmond
i
so
afraid
of
you
i
afraid
of
boring
you
remorse
stirred
her
you
always
been
most
awfully
kind
she
said
warmly
i
often
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
sorry
about
that
first
time
i
saw
you
not
sorry
for
what
i
she
added
in
haste
i
can
never
be
anything
but
glad
for
that
but
i
sorry
i
seemed
ungrateful
to
you
now
you
give
me
courage
he
said
i
do
know
a
quiet
little
place
quite
near
here
and
as
you
have
any
of
your
friends
with
you
wo
you
take
pity
on
me
and
let
me
dine
with
you
you
sure
you
not
giving
up
some
nice
engagement
just
to
to
be
kind
to
me
she
asked
and
the
forlornness
of
her
tone
made
him
almost
forget
that
he
had
half
promised
to
join
a
party
of
lady
craye
i
should
like
to
come
with
you
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
he
said
and
he
said
it
convincingly
they
dined
together
and
the
dinner
was
unexpectedly
pleasant
to
both
of
them
they
talked
of
england
of
wood
field
and
meadow
and
betty
found
herself
talking
to
him
of
the
garden
at
home
and
of
the
things
that
grew
there
as
she
had
talked
to
paula
and
as
she
had
never
talked
to
vernon
it
so
lovely
all
the
year
she
said
when
the
last
over
there
are
the
chrysanthemums
and
then
the
christmas
roses
and
ever
so
early
in
january
the
winter
aconite
and
the
and
the
violets
under
the
south
wall
and
then
the
little
green
daffodil
leaves
come
up
and
the
buds
though
it
weeks
before
they
turn
into
flowers
and
if
it
a
mild
winter
the
primroses
just
little
baby
ones
seem
to
go
on
all
the
time
yes
he
said
i
know
and
the
wallflowers
they
green
all
the
and
the
monthly
roses
they
flower
at
christmas
and
then
when
the
real
roses
begin
to
bud
and
when
june
comes
and
you
drunk
with
the
scent
of
red
roses
the
kind
you
always
long
for
at
christmas
oh
yes
said
betty
do
you
feel
like
that
too
and
if
you
get
them
they
soft
things
like
caterpillars
half
disguised
as
roses
by
some
incompetent
fairy
not
like
the
stiff
solid
heavy
velvet
roses
with
thick
green
leaves
and
heaps
of
thorns
those
are
the
roses
one
longs
for
yes
he
said
those
are
the
roses
one
longs
for
and
an
odd
pause
punctuated
the
sentence
but
the
pause
did
not
last
there
was
so
much
to
talk
of
now
that
barrier
of
resentment
wattled
with
remorse
was
broken
down
it
was
an
odd
revelation
to
each
the
love
of
the
other
for
certain
authors
certain
pictures
certain
symphonies
certain
dramas
the
discovery
of
this
sort
of
community
of
tastes
is
like
the
meeting
in
far
foreign
countries
of
a
man
who
speaks
the
tongue
of
one
mother
land
the
two
lingered
long
over
their
coffee
and
the
grand
marnier
which
their
liking
for
the
garden
of
lies
led
to
their
ordering
betty
had
forgotten
vernon
forgotten
lady
craye
in
the
delightful
interchange
of
oh
i
do
like
and
do
you
like
and
is
that
splendid
these
simple
sentences
interchanged
took
on
the
value
of
intimate
confidences
i
had
such
a
jolly
time
temple
said
i
have
had
such
a
talk
for
ages
and
yet
all
the
talk
had
been
mere
confessions
of
faith
in
ibsen
in
browning
in
maeterlinck
in
english
gardens
in
art
for
art
sake
and
in
whistler
and
beethoven
i
liked
it
too
said
betty
and
it
awfully
jolly
he
went
on
to
feel
that
you
forgiven
me
the
speech
suddenly
became
difficult
at
least
i
mean
to
say
he
ended
lamely
it
i
who
ought
to
be
forgiven
said
betty
i
very
glad
i
met
you
i
enjoyed
our
talk
ever
so
much
vernon
spent
an
empty
evening
and
waylaid
betty
as
she
left
her
class
next
day
i
sorry
she
said
i
could
help
it
i
suddenly
felt
i
wanted
something
different
so
i
dined
at
a
new
place
alone
said
vernon
no
said
betty
with
her
chin
in
the
air
vernon
digested
as
best
he
might
his
first
mouthful
of
jealousy
real
downright
sickening
jealousy
the
sensation
astonished
him
so
much
that
he
lacked
the
courage
to
dissect
it
will
you
dine
with
me
was
all
he
found
to
say
with
pleasure
said
betty
but
it
was
not
with
pleasure
that
she
dined
there
was
something
between
her
and
vernon
both
felt
it
and
both
attributed
it
to
the
same
cause
the
three
dinners
that
followed
in
the
next
fortnight
brought
none
of
that
old
lighthearted
companionship
which
had
been
the
gayest
of
something
was
gone
lost
as
though
a
royal
rose
had
suddenly
faded
a
bubble
had
broken
i
glad
said
betty
if
he
engaged
i
do
want
to
feel
happy
with
him
she
did
not
feel
happy
without
him
the
inward
monitor
grew
more
and
more
insistent
she
caught
herself
wondering
how
temple
with
the
serious
face
and
the
honest
eyes
would
regard
the
lies
the
trickeries
the
whole
tissue
of
deceit
that
had
won
her
her
chance
of
following
her
own
art
of
living
her
own
life
vernon
understood
presently
that
not
even
that
evening
at
could
give
the
key
to
this
uncomforting
change
he
had
not
seen
lady
craye
since
the
night
of
the
kiss
it
was
after
the
fourth
flat
dinner
with
betty
that
he
said
to
her
early
and
abruptly
and
drove
to
lady
craye
she
was
alone
she
rose
to
greet
him
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
and
her
lips
rough
this
is
very
nice
of
you
she
said
it
nearly
a
month
since
i
saw
you
yes
he
said
i
know
it
is
do
you
remember
the
last
time
that
taught
you
not
to
play
with
me
the
kiss
was
explained
now
lady
craye
shivered
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
said
feebly
oh
yes
you
do
you
much
too
clever
not
to
understand
come
to
think
of
it
you
much
too
everything
too
clever
too
beautiful
too
charming
too
everything
you
overwhelm
me
she
made
herself
say
not
at
all
you
know
your
points
what
i
want
to
know
is
just
one
thing
and
that
the
thing
you
going
to
tell
me
she
drew
her
dry
lips
inward
to
moisten
them
what
do
you
want
to
know
why
do
you
speak
to
me
like
that
what
have
i
done
that
what
you
going
to
tell
me
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
while
you
ask
in
that
tone
wo
you
how
can
i
persuade
you
his
tone
caressed
and
stung
what
arguments
can
i
use
must
i
kiss
you
again
she
drew
herself
up
called
wildly
on
all
her
powers
to
resent
the
insult
nothing
came
at
her
call
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
she
asked
and
her
eyes
implored
the
mercy
she
would
not
consciously
have
asked
he
saw
and
he
came
a
little
nearer
to
her
looking
down
at
her
upturned
face
with
eyes
before
which
her
own
fell
you
do
want
another
kiss
he
said
then
tell
me
what
you
been
saying
to
miss
desmond
chapter
xviii
the
truth
there
was
a
silence
come
my
pretty
jasmine
lady
speak
the
truth
i
will
what
a
brute
you
are
so
another
lady
told
me
a
few
months
ago
come
tell
me
why
should
i
tell
you
anything
she
tried
to
touch
her
tone
with
scorn
because
i
choose
you
thought
you
could
play
with
me
and
fool
me
and
trick
me
out
of
what
i
mean
to
have
what
you
mean
to
have
yes
what
i
mean
to
have
i
mean
to
marry
miss
desmond
if
have
me
mean
to
marry
saul
is
among
the
prophets
with
a
vengeance
the
scorn
came
naturally
to
her
voice
now
vernon
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
nothing
had
ever
astonished
him
so
much
as
those
four
words
spoken
in
his
own
voice
i
mean
to
marry
he
repeated
them
i
mean
to
marry
miss
desmond
if
she
have
me
and
it
your
doing
of
course
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
naturally
it
would
be
you
sit
down
you
look
so
uncomfortable
those
french
tragedy
scenes
with
the
hero
hat
in
one
hand
and
gloves
in
the
other
always
seem
to
me
so
comic
that
was
her
score
the
first
he
put
down
the
hat
and
gloves
and
came
towards
her
and
as
he
came
he
hastily
sketched
his
plan
of
action
when
he
reached
her
it
was
ready
formed
his
anger
was
always
short
lived
it
had
died
down
and
left
him
competent
as
ever
to
handle
the
scene
he
took
her
hands
pushed
her
gently
into
a
chair
near
the
table
and
sat
down
beside
her
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hands
forgive
me
dear
he
said
i
was
a
brute
forgive
me
and
help
me
no
one
can
help
me
but
you
it
was
a
and
he
had
staked
a
good
deal
on
it
the
stake
was
not
lost
she
found
no
words
my
dear
sweet
jasmine
lady
he
said
let
me
talk
to
you
let
me
tell
you
everything
i
can
talk
to
you
as
i
can
talk
to
no
one
else
because
i
know
you
fond
of
me
you
are
fond
of
me
a
little
you
for
the
sake
of
old
times
yes
she
said
i
am
fond
of
you
and
you
forgive
me
you
do
forgive
me
for
being
such
a
brute
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
yes
she
said
speaking
as
one
speaks
in
dreams
i
forgive
you
thank
you
he
said
humbly
you
were
always
generous
and
you
always
understand
wait
wait
i
attend
to
you
presently
she
was
saying
to
her
heart
yes
i
know
it
all
over
i
know
the
game
up
let
me
pull
through
this
without
disgracing
myself
and
i
let
you
hurt
me
as
much
as
you
like
afterwards
tell
me
she
said
gently
to
vernon
tell
me
everything
he
was
silent
his
face
still
hidden
he
had
cut
the
knot
of
an
impossible
situation
and
he
was
pausing
to
admire
the
cleverness
of
the
stroke
in
two
minutes
he
had
blotted
out
the
last
six
months
months
in
which
he
and
she
had
been
adversaries
he
had
thrown
himself
on
her
mercy
and
he
had
done
wisely
never
even
in
the
days
when
he
had
carefully
taught
himself
to
be
in
love
with
her
had
he
liked
her
so
well
as
now
when
she
got
up
from
her
chair
to
come
and
lay
her
hand
softly
on
his
shoulder
and
to
say
my
poor
boy
but
there
nothing
for
you
to
be
unhappy
about
tell
me
all
about
it
from
the
very
beginning
there
was
a
luxurious
temptation
in
the
idea
it
was
not
the
first
time
naturally
that
vernon
had
told
all
about
it
with
a
sympathetic
on
his
shoulder
he
knew
the
strategic
value
of
confidences
but
always
he
had
made
the
confidences
fit
the
occasion
serve
the
end
he
had
in
view
now
such
end
as
had
been
in
view
was
gained
he
knew
that
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
now
before
she
should
tell
him
of
her
own
accord
what
he
could
never
by
any
brutality
have
forced
her
to
tell
and
the
temptation
to
speak
for
once
the
truth
about
himself
was
overmastering
it
is
a
luxury
one
can
so
very
rarely
afford
most
of
us
go
the
whole
long
without
tasting
it
there
was
nothing
to
lose
by
speaking
the
truth
moreover
he
must
say
something
and
why
not
the
truth
so
he
said
it
all
comes
of
that
confounded
habit
of
mine
of
wanting
to
be
in
love
yes
she
said
you
were
always
so
anxious
to
be
were
you
and
you
never
were
till
now
the
echo
of
his
hidden
thought
made
it
easier
for
him
to
go
on
it
was
at
long
barton
he
said
it
a
little
dead
and
alive
place
in
kent
i
was
painting
that
picture
that
you
like
the
one
that
in
the
salon
and
i
was
bored
to
death
and
she
walked
straight
into
the
composition
in
a
pink
gown
that
made
her
look
like
a
la
france
rose
that
has
been
rained
on
you
know
the
sort
of
and
it
was
love
at
first
sight
said
she
and
took
away
her
hand
not
it
said
vernon
catching
the
hand
and
holding
it
it
was
just
the
usual
thing
i
wanted
it
to
be
like
all
the
others
like
mine
she
said
looking
down
on
him
nothing
could
be
like
he
had
the
grace
to
say
looking
up
at
her
that
was
only
like
the
others
in
one
thing
that
it
what
am
i
thinking
of
to
let
you
stand
there
he
got
up
and
led
her
to
the
divan
they
sat
down
side
by
side
she
wanted
to
laugh
to
sing
to
scream
here
was
he
sitting
by
her
like
a
lover
holding
her
hand
the
first
time
these
two
years
three
years
nearly
his
voice
tender
as
ever
and
he
was
telling
her
about
her
no
he
went
on
burrowing
his
shoulder
comfortably
in
the
cushions
it
was
just
the
ordinary
outline
sketch
but
it
was
coming
very
nicely
she
was
beginning
to
be
interested
and
i
had
taught
myself
almost
all
that
was
needed
i
did
want
to
marry
her
i
did
want
anything
except
those
delicate
delightful
emotions
that
come
before
one
is
quite
quite
sure
that
she
but
you
know
yes
she
said
i
know
then
her
father
interfered
and
vulgarized
the
whole
thing
he
a
parson
a
weak
little
rat
but
i
was
sorry
for
him
then
an
aunt
came
on
the
scene
a
most
gentlemanly
lady
he
laughed
a
little
at
the
recollection
and
i
promised
not
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
see
her
again
it
was
quite
easy
the
bloom
was
already
brushed
from
the
adventure
i
finished
the
picture
and
went
to
brittany
and
forgot
the
whole
silly
business
there
was
some
one
in
brittany
of
course
of
course
said
he
there
always
is
i
had
a
delightful
summer
then
in
october
sitting
at
the
café
de
la
paix
i
saw
her
pass
it
was
the
same
day
i
saw
you
before
or
after
you
saw
me
after
then
if
i
stopped
if
i
made
you
come
for
a
drive
then
and
there
you
never
have
seen
her
that
so
said
vernon
and
by
heaven
i
almost
wish
you
had
the
wish
was
a
serpent
in
her
heart
she
said
go
on
and
he
went
on
and
warming
to
his
subject
grew
eloquent
on
the
events
of
the
winter
his
emotions
his
surmises
as
to
emotions
his
slow
awakening
to
the
knowledge
that
now
for
the
first
time
and
so
on
and
so
forth
you
do
know
how
i
tried
to
fall
in
love
with
you
again
he
said
and
kissed
her
hand
you
prettier
than
she
is
and
cleverer
and
a
thousand
times
more
adorable
but
it
no
good
it
a
sort
of
madness
you
never
were
in
love
with
me
no
i
do
think
i
was
but
i
was
happier
with
you
than
i
shall
ever
be
with
her
for
all
that
talk
of
the
joy
of
love
love
hurts
hurts
damnably
i
beg
your
pardon
yes
i
believe
it
painful
go
on
he
went
on
he
was
enjoying
himself
now
thoroughly
and
so
the
long
tale
ended
when
i
found
she
had
scruples
about
going
about
with
me
alone
because
her
father
had
suggested
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
i
i
let
her
think
that
i
was
engaged
to
you
that
is
too
much
she
cried
and
would
have
risen
but
he
kept
her
hand
fast
ah
do
be
angry
he
pleaded
you
see
i
knew
you
did
care
about
me
a
little
bit
and
i
never
thought
you
and
she
would
come
across
each
other
so
you
knew
all
the
time
that
i
did
care
her
clutched
at
the
spar
he
threw
out
of
course
i
not
such
a
fool
as
to
think
ah
forgive
me
for
letting
her
think
that
it
bought
me
all
i
cared
to
ask
for
of
her
time
she
so
young
so
innocent
she
thought
it
was
quite
all
right
as
long
as
i
belonged
to
someone
else
and
could
make
love
to
her
and
have
you
never
never
once
since
the
days
at
long
barton
when
it
had
to
be
and
even
then
i
only
made
the
very
beginnings
of
it
now
i
suppose
you
been
very
very
happy
do
i
tell
you
i
never
been
so
wretched
in
my
life
i
despise
myself
i
always
made
everything
go
as
i
wanted
it
to
go
now
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
feuille
do
you
know
and
i
hate
it
and
i
hate
her
being
here
without
anyone
to
look
after
her
a
hundred
times
i
had
it
on
the
tip
of
my
pen
to
send
that
doddering
old
underwood
an
anonymous
letter
telling
him
all
about
it
underwood
her
oh
i
forgot
i
did
tell
you
he
proceeded
to
tell
her
betty
secret
the
death
of
madame
gautier
and
betty
bid
for
freedom
i
see
she
said
slowly
well
there
no
great
harm
done
but
i
wish
you
trusted
me
before
you
wanted
to
know
at
the
beginning
of
this
remarkable
interview
she
laughed
rather
forlornly
what
i
had
told
miss
desmond
well
i
went
to
see
her
and
when
she
told
me
that
you
told
her
you
were
engaged
to
me
i
i
just
acted
the
jealous
a
little
bit
i
thought
i
was
helping
you
playing
up
to
you
i
suppose
i
overdid
it
i
sorry
the
question
is
said
he
anxiously
whether
she
forgive
me
for
that
lie
she
most
awfully
straight
you
know
she
seems
to
have
lied
herself
lady
craye
could
not
help
saying
ah
yes
but
only
to
her
father
that
hardly
counts
you
think
it
not
the
same
thing
as
lying
to
the
person
you
love
i
wish
i
wonder
whether
you
mind
if
i
never
told
her
it
was
a
lie
could
i
tell
her
that
we
were
engaged
but
you
broken
it
off
that
you
found
you
liked
temple
better
or
something
she
gasped
before
the
sudden
vision
of
the
naked
gigantic
egotism
of
a
man
in
love
you
can
tell
her
what
you
like
she
said
wearily
a
lie
or
two
more
or
less
what
does
it
matter
i
do
want
to
lie
to
her
said
vernon
i
hate
to
but
she
never
understand
the
truth
you
think
understand
it
the
truth
you
been
telling
me
he
laughed
i
do
think
i
ever
told
so
much
truth
in
all
my
life
and
you
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
you
alway
did
enjoy
new
sensations
ah
do
sneer
at
me
you
do
understand
not
quite
changed
i
really
do
feel
as
though
i
been
born
again
the
point
of
view
has
shifted
and
so
suddenly
so
completely
it
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
but
the
new
earth
not
comfortable
and
i
suppose
i
shall
ever
get
the
new
heaven
but
you
help
me
advise
me
do
you
think
i
ought
to
tell
her
at
once
you
see
she
so
different
from
other
girls
she
she
is
lady
craye
interrupted
except
that
she
the
one
you
love
she
not
a
bit
different
from
other
girls
no
different
from
other
girls
ah
you
do
know
her
he
said
you
see
she
so
young
and
brave
and
true
and
what
is
it
why
lady
craye
had
rested
her
head
against
his
and
he
knew
that
she
was
crying
what
is
it
my
dear
do
you
mus
cry
i
at
least
i
very
tired
brute
that
i
am
he
said
with
late
compunction
and
i
been
worrying
you
with
all
my
silly
affairs
cheer
up
and
smile
at
me
before
i
go
of
course
you
tired
his
hand
on
her
soft
hair
held
her
head
against
his
arm
no
she
said
suddenly
it
is
that
i
tired
really
you
told
the
truth
why
should
i
vernon
instantly
and
deeply
regretted
the
lapse
you
really
going
to
marry
the
girl

mean
it
yes
then
i
help
you
i
do
everything
i
can
for

he
said
kindly

your
true
friend

will
because
i
love
you
eustace
i
always

truth

pretended
to

years

wish
i
never
seen
you
i
wish

born

i

he
said
and
rose
she
buried
her
face
in
the
cushion
where
his
shoulder
had
been
he
was
looking
round
for
his
hat
and
gloves
more
uncomfortable
than
he
ever
remembered
to
have
been
as
he
reached
the
door
she
sprang
up
and
he
heard
the
silken
swish
of
her
gray
gown
coming
towards
him
say
she
pleaded
oh
eustace
kiss
me
again
kindly
not
like
last
time
he
met
her
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
forehead
very
gently
very
tenderly
my
dearest
jasmine
lady
he
said
it
sounds
an
impertinence
and
i
daresay
you
wo
believe
it
but
i
was
never
so
sorry
in
my
life
as
i
am
now
i
a
beast
and
i
do
deserve
to
live
think
what
a
beast
i
am
and
try
to
hate
me
she
clung
to
him
and
laid
her
wet
cheek
against
his
then
her
lips
implored
his
lips
there
was
a
long
silence
it
was
she
she
was
always
glad
of
that
who
at
last
found
her
courage
and
drew
back
she
said
i
shall
be
quite
sane
and
then
help
you
when
he
got
out
into
the
street
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
not
yet
ten
he
hailed
a
carriage
boulevard
montparnasse
he
said
he
could
still
feel
lady
craye
wet
cheek
against
his
own
the
despairing
passion
of
her
last
kisses
had
thrilled
him
through
and
through
he
wanted
to
efface
the
mark
of
those
kisses
he
would
not
be
haunted
all
night
by
any
lips
but
betty
he
had
never
called
at
her
rooms
in
the
evening
he
had
been
careful
for
her
in
that
even
now
as
he
rang
the
bell
he
was
careful
and
when
the
latch
clicked
and
the
door
was
opened
a
cautious
inch
he
was
ready
as
he
entered
to
call
out
in
passing
the
concierge
door
not
miss
desmond
name
but
the
name
of
the
canadian
artist
who
occupied
the
studio
on
the
top
floor
he
went
softly
up
the
stairs
and
stood
listening
outside
betty
door
then
he
knocked
gently
no
one
answered
nothing
stirred
inside
she
may
be
out
he
told
himself
i
wait
a
bit
at
the
same
time
he
tapped
again
and
this
time
beyond
the
door
something
did
stir
then
came
betty
voice
est
it
me
vernon
may
i
come
in
a
moment
pause
then
no
you
ca
possibly
is
anything
the
matter
no
oh
no
but
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
may
i
come
early
you
sure
there
nothing
wrong
at
home
or
anything
you
come
to
break
anything
to
me
no
no
it
only
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
began
to
feel
a
fool
with
his
guarded
whispers
through
a
locked
door
then
come
at
twelve
said
betty
in
the
tones
of
finality
he
heard
an
inner
door
close
and
went
slowly
away
he
walked
a
long
way
that
night
it
was
not
till
he
was
back
in
his
rooms
and
had
lighted
his
candle
and
wound
up
his
watch
that
lady
craye
kisses
began
to
haunt
him
in
good
earnest
as
he
had
known
they
would
lady
craye
left
alone
dried
her
eyes
and
set
to
work
with
heart
still
beating
wildly
to
look
about
her
at
the
ruins
of
her
world
the
room
was
quiet
with
the
horrible
quiet
of
a
death
chamber
and
yet
his
voice
still
echoed
in
it
only
a
moment
ago
she
had
been
in
his
arms
as
she
had
never
hoped
to
be
again
more
as
she
had
never
been
before
he
would
have
loved
me
now
she
told
herself
if
it
had
been
for
that
girl
he
did
love
me
before
he
was
only
playing
at
love
he
did
know
what
love
was
but
he
knows
now
and
it
all
too
late
but
was
it
a
word
to
betty
and
but
you
promised
to
help
him
that
was
before
he
kissed
me
but
a
promise
is
a
promise
yes
and
your
life
your
life
you
never
have
another
she
stood
still
her
hands
hanging
by
her
sides
clenched
hands
that
the
rings
bit
into
he
will
go
to
her
early
and
she
accept
him
of
course
she
never
seen
anyone
else
the
little
fool
she
knew
that
she
herself
would
have
taken
him
would
have
chosen
him
as
the
chief
among
ten
thousand
she
could
have
temple
she
be
much
happier
with
temple
she
and
eustace
would
make
each
other
wretched
she
never
understand
him
and
he
be
tired
of
her
in
a
week
she
had
turned
up
the
electric
lights
now
at
her
toilet
table
and
was
pulling
the
pins
out
of
her
ruffled
hair
and
he
never
care
about
her
children
and
they
be
ugly
little
horrors
she
was
twisting
her
hair
up
quickly
and
firmly
i
a
right
to
live
my
own
life
she
said
just
as
betty
had
said
six
months
before
why
am
i
to
sacrifice
everything
to
her
especially
when
i
do
suppose
she
cares
and
now
that
i
know
i
could
get
him
if
she
were
out
of
the
way
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
laughed
and
you
always
thought
yourself
a
proud
woman
suddenly
she
dropped
the
brush
it
rattled
and
spun
on
the
polished
floor
she
stamped
her
foot
that
settles
it
she
said
for
in
that
instant
she
perceived
quite
clearly
and
without
mistake
that
vernon
attitude
had
been
a
that
he
had
thrown
himself
on
her
pity
of
set
purpose
with
an
end
to
gain
laughing
at
me
all
the
time
too
of
course
and
i
thought
i
understood
him
well
i
do
misunderstand
him
for
long
anyway
she
said
and
picked
up
the
hair
brush
you
silly
fool
she
said
to
the
woman
in
the
glass
and
now
she
was
fully
dressed
in
long
light
coat
and
a
hat
with
as
usual
violets
in
it
she
paused
a
moment
before
her
turned
up
its
light
turned
it
down
again
no
she
said
one
does
write
anonymous
letters
besides
it
would
be
too
late
he
see
her
early
early
the
door
of
the
flat
banged
behind
her
as
it
had
banged
behind
vernon
half
an
hour
before
like
him
she
called
a
carriage
and
on
her
lips
too
as
the
chill
april
air
caressed
them
was
the
sense
of
kisses
and
she
too
gave
to
the
coachman
the
address
boulevard
montparnasse
chapter
xix
the
truth
with
a
vengeance
in
those
three
weeks
whose
meetings
with
vernon
had
been
so
lacking
in
charm
there
had
been
other
meetings
for
betty
and
in
these
charm
had
not
been
to
seek
but
it
was
the
charm
of
restful
pleasant
companionship
illuminated
by
a
growing
certainty
that
temple
admired
her
very
much
that
he
liked
her
very
much
that
he
did
not
think
her
untidy
and
countrified
and
and
all
the
things
she
had
felt
herself
to
be
that
night
when
lady
craye
and
her
furs
had
rustled
up
the
staircase
at
thirion
and
she
had
dined
with
temple
and
lunched
with
temple
and
there
had
been
an
afternoon
at
st
cloud
and
a
day
at
versailles
miss
voscoe
and
some
of
the
other
students
had
been
in
the
party
but
not
of
it
as
far
as
betty
was
concerned
she
had
talked
to
temple
all
the
time
i
glad
to
see
you
taken
my
advice
said
miss
voscoe
only
you
do
go
at
things
so
like
a
bull
at
a
gate
a
month
ago
it
was
all
that
ruffian
vernon
now
it
all
why
not
have
a
change
try
a
pole
or
a
german
but
betty
declined
to
try
a
pole
or
a
german
what
she
wanted
to
do
was
to
persuade
herself
that
she
liked
temple
as
much
as
she
liked
vernon
and
further
that
she
did
not
care
a
straw
for
either
of
course
it
is
very
wrong
indeed
to
talk
pleasantly
with
a
young
man
when
you
think
you
know
that
he
might
just
possibly
be
falling
in
love
with
you
but
then
it
is
very
interesting
too
to
be
loved
even
by
the
wrong
person
seems
in
youth
selfish
eyes
to
light
up
the
world
as
the
candle
lights
the
japanese
lantern
and
besides
after
all
one
ca
be
sure
and
it
is
not
maidenly
to
say
no
even
by
the
vaguest
movements
of
retreat
to
a
question
that
has
not
been
asked
and
perhaps
never
will
be
and
when
she
was
talking
to
temple
she
was
not
thinking
so
much
of
vernon
and
of
her
unselfish
friendship
for
him
and
the
depth
of
her
hope
that
he
really
be
happy
with
that
woman
so
that
it
was
with
quite
a
sick
feeling
that
her
days
had
been
robbed
of
something
that
made
them
easier
to
live
if
not
quite
worth
living
that
she
read
and
reread
the
letter
that
she
found
waiting
for
her
after
that
last
unsuccessful
dinner
with
the
man
whom
temple
helped
her
to
forget
you
will
see
by
the
letter
what
progress
friendship
can
make
in
a
month
between
a
young
man
and
woman
even
when
each
is
half
in
love
with
some
one
else
sweet
friend
said
the
letter
this
is
to
say
for
a
little
while
but
you
will
think
of
me
when
i
am
away
wo
you
i
am
going
into
the
country
to
make
some
sketches
and
to
think
i
do
believe
it
is
possible
for
english
people
to
think
in
paris
and
i
have
things
to
think
over
that
wo
let
themselves
be
thought
over
quietly
here
and
i
want
to
see
the
spring
i
wo
ask
you
to
write
to
me
because
i
want
to
be
quite
alone
and
not
to
have
even
a
word
from
my
sweet
and
dear
friend
i
hope
your
work
will
go
well
yours
robert
temple
betty
in
bed
was
this
when
vernon
knock
came
at
her
door
she
spoke
to
him
through
the
door
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
and
her
real
thought
when
she
asked
him
if
he
had
come
to
break
bad
news
was
that
something
had
happened
to
temple
she
went
back
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
keep
away
the
wonder
what
could
vernon
have
had
to
say
that
wanted
so
badly
to
get
itself
said
she
hid
her
eyes
and
would
not
look
in
the
face
of
her
hope
there
had
been
a
tone
in
his
voice
as
he
whispered
on
the
other
side
of
that
stupid
door
a
tone
she
had
not
heard
since
long
barton
oh
why
had
she
gone
to
bed
early
that
night
of
all
nights
she
would
never
go
to
bed
early
again
as
long
as
she
lived
what
no
impossible
yes
another
knock
at
her
door
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
stood
listening
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
vernon
had
come
back
after
all
what
he
had
to
say
would
not
keep
till
morning
a
wild
idea
of
dressing
and
letting
him
in
was
sternly
dismissed
for
one
thing
at
topmost
speed
it
took
twenty
minutes
to
dress
he
would
not
wait
twenty
minutes
another
knock
she
threw
on
her
dressing
gown
and
ran
along
her
little
passage
and
stooped
to
the
just
as
another
tap
discreet
but
insistent
rang
on
the
door
panel
go
away
she
said
low
and
earnestly
i
ca
talk
to
you
it
it
must
wait
till
the
morning
it
i
said
the
very
last
voice
in
all
paris
that
she
expected
to
hear
it
lady
st
wo
you
let
me
in
are
you
alone
said
betty
of
course
i
alone
it
most
important
do
open
the
door
the
door
was
slowly
opened
the
visitor
rustled
through
and
betty
shut
the
door
then
she
followed
lady
craye
into
the
lighted
the
lamp
drew
the
curtain
across
the
clear
april
night
and
stood
looking
enquiry
and
not
looking
it
kindly
her
lips
were
set
in
a
hard
line
and
she
was
frowning
she
waited
for
the
other
to
speak
but
after
all
it
was
she
who
broke
the
silence
well
she
said
what
do
you
want
now
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
said
lady
craye
with
great
truth
i
should
think
not
said
betty
i
do
want
to
be
disagreeable
but
i
ca
think
of
anything
that
gives
you
the
right
to
come
and
knock
me
up
like
this
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
only
just
past
eleven
said
lady
craye
and
there
was
another
silence
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
a
dozen
openings
suggested
themselves
and
were
instantly
rejected
then
quite
suddenly
she
knew
exactly
what
to
say
what
to
do
that
move
of
vernon
it
was
a
good
one
a
move
too
often
neglected
in
this
cynical
world
but
always
successful
on
the
stage
may
i
sit
down
she
asked
forlornly
betty
rather
roughly
pushed
forward
a
chair
lady
craye
sank
into
it
looked
full
at
betty
for
a
long
minute
and
by
the
lamp
yellow
light
betty
saw
the
tears
rise
brim
over
and
fall
from
the
other
woman
lashes
then
lady
craye
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
began
to
cry
in
good
earnest
it
was
quite
easy
at
first
betty
looked
on
in
cold
contempt
lady
craye
had
counted
on
that
she
let
herself
go
wholly
if
it
ended
in
hysterics
so
much
the
more
impressive
she
thought
of
vernon
of
all
the
hopes
of
these
months
of
the
downfall
of
them
everything
that
should
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
stop
crying
do
distress
yourself
said
betty
very
chill
and
distant
can
you
can
you
lend
me
a
handkerchief
said
the
other
unexpectedly
screwing
up
her
own
drenched
cambric
in
her
hand
betty
fetched
a
handkerchief
i
have
any
scent
she
said
i
sorry
that
nearly
dried
the
tears
but
not
quite
lady
craye
was
a
persevering
woman
betty
watching
her
slowly
melted
just
as
the
other
knew
she
would
she
put
her
hand
at
last
on
the
shoulder
of
the
light
coat
come
she
said
do
cry
so
i
sure
there
nothing
to
be
so
upset
about
then
came
to
her
sharp
as
any
knife
the
thought
of
what
there
might
be
there
nothing
wrong
with
anyone
there
has
been
an
accident
or
anything
the
other
still
speechless
conveyed
no
do
said
betty
again
and
slowly
and
very
artistically
the
flood
was
abated
lady
craye
was
almost
calm
though
still
her
breath
caught
now
and
then
in
little
broken
sighs
i
so
sorry
she
said
so
breaking
down
like
this
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
as
unhappy
as
i
am
betty
thought
she
did
we
all
think
we
do
in
the
presence
of
any
grief
not
our
own
can
i
do
anything
she
spoke
much
more
kindly
than
she
had
expected
to
speak
will
you
let
me
tell
you
everything
the
whole
truth
of
course
if
you
want
to
but
then
do
sit
down
and
oh
do
be
angry
with
me
i
am
so
wretched
just
now
you
thought
something
had
happened
to
vernon
will
you
just
tell
me
one
thing
do
you
love
him
you
no
right
to
ask
me
that
i
know
i
have
well
i
trust
you
though
you
do
trust
me
i
tell
you
everything
two
years
ago
vernon
and
i
were
engaged
this
was
not
true
but
it
took
less
time
to
tell
than
the
truth
would
have
taken
and
sounded
better
we
were
engaged
and
i
was
very
fond
of
him
but
he
you
know
what
he
is
about
women
no
said
betty
steadily
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
about
him
but
you
he
is
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
there
always
some
woman
besides
the
one
with
him
i
understand
that
now
i
did
then
i
do
think
he
can
help
it
it
his
temperament
i
see
said
betty
evenly
her
hands
and
feet
were
very
cold
she
was
astonished
to
find
how
little
moved
she
was
in
this
interview
whose
end
she
foresaw
so
very
plainly
yes
and
there
was
a
girl
at
that
time
he
was
always
about
with
her
and
i
made
him
scenes
always
a
most
stupid
thing
to
do
with
a
man
you
know
and
at
last
i
said
he
must
give
her
up
or
give
me
up
and
he
gave
me
up
and
i
was
too
proud
to
let
him
think
i
cared
and
just
to
show
him
how
little
i
cared
i
married
sir
harry
craye
i
might
just
as
well
have
let
it
alone
he
never
even
heard
i
had
been
married
till
last
october
and
then
it
was
i
who
told
him
my
husband
was
a
brute
and
i
thankful
to
say
he
did
live
long
you
very
much
shocked
i
afraid
not
at
all
said
betty
who
was
rather
well
then
i
met
him
again
and
we
got
engaged
again
as
he
told
you
and
again
there
was
a
girl
oh
and
another
woman
besides
but
this
time
i
tried
to
bear
it
you
know
i
did
try
not
to
be
jealous
of
you
you
had
no
cause
said
betty
well
i
thought
i
had
that
hurts
just
as
much
and
what
the
end
of
it
all
all
my
patience
and
trying
not
to
see
things
and
letting
him
have
his
own
way
he
came
to
me
and
begged
me
to
release
him
from
his
engagement
because
oh
he
was
beautifully
candid
because
he
meant
to
marry
you
betty
heart
gave
a
jump
he
seems
to
have
been
very
sure
of
me
she
said
loftily
no
no
he
not
a
hairdresser
apprentice
to
tell
one
woman
that
he
sure
of
another
he
said
mean
to
marry
miss
desmond
if
have
me
how
kind
of
him
i
wish
you
heard
the
way
he
spoke
of
you
i
do
want
to
hear
had
to
and
i
released
him
and
now
i
come
to
you
i
was
proud
two
years
ago
i
not
proud
now
i
do
care
what
i
do
kneel
down
at
your
feet
and
pray
to
you
as
if
you
were
god
not
to
take
him
away
from
me
and
if
you
love
him
it
all
be
no
good
i
know
that
but
supposing
i
were
here
do
you
think
you
could
get
him
back
i
know
i
could
unless
of
course
you
were
to
tell
him
i
been
here
i
should
have
no
chance
after
that
naturally
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
say
to
you
you
very
young
you
find
someone
else
a
better
man
he
not
a
good
man
there
a
girl
at
montmartre
at
this
very
moment
a
girl
he
set
up
in
a
restaurant
he
goes
to
see
her
you
never
stand
that
sort
of
thing
i
know
the
sort
of
girl
you
are
and
you
quite
right
but
i
got
beyond
that
i
do
care
what
he
is
i
do
care
what
he
does
i
understand
him
i
can
make
allowances
for
him
i
his
real
mate
i
could
make
him
happy
you
never
would
you
too
good
ever
since
i
first
met
him
i
thought
of
nothing
else
cared
for
nothing
else
if
he
whistled
to
me
i
give
up
everything
else
everything
and
follow
him
barefoot
round
the
world
i
heard
someone
say
that
in
a
play
once
said
betty
musing
so
did
i
said
lady
craye
very
sharply
but
it
true
for
all
that
well
you
can
do
as
you
like
of
course
i
can
said
betty
i
done
all
i
can
now
i
said
everything
there
is
to
say
and
if
you
love
him
as
i
love
him
every
word
i
said
wo
make
a
scrap
of
difference
i
know
that
well
enough
what
i
want
to
know
is
you
love
him
the
scene
had
been
set
deliberately
but
the
passion
that
spoke
in
it
was
not
assumed
betty
felt
young
awkward
in
the
presence
of
this
love
so
different
from
her
own
timid
dreams
the
emotion
of
the
other
woman
had
softened
her
i
do
know
she
said
if
you
do
know
you
do
love
at
least
do
see
him
till
you
sure
you
do
that
as
long
as
he
not
married
to
anyone
there
just
a
chance
that
he
may
love
me
again
wo
you
have
pity
wo
you
go
away
like
that
sensible
young
man
temple
vernon
told
me
he
was
going
into
the
country
to
decide
which
of
the
two
women
he
likes
best
is
the
one
he
really
likes
best
wo
you
do
that
yes
said
betty
slowly
i
do
that
here
i
am
most
awfully
sorry
but
i
do
know
i
ca
think
i
go
right
away
i
wo
see
him
oh
no
i
ca
come
between
you
and
the
man
you
engaged
to
her
thoughts
were
clearing
themselves
as
she
spoke
of
course
i
knew
you
were
engaged
to
him
but
i
never
thought
at
least
yes
i
go
away
the
first
thing
you
are
very
very
good
said
lady
craye
and
she
meant
it
but
i
do
know
where
to
go
tell
me
where
to
go
ca
you
go
home
no
i
wo
that
too
much
go
somewhere
and
sketch
yes
but
said
poor
betty
impatiently
go
to
grez
said
the
other
not
without
second
thoughts
it
a
lovely
place
close
to
fontainebleau
hotel
chevillon
i
write
it
down
for
old
madame
chevillon
a
darling
she
look
after
you
it
good
of
you
to
forgive
me
for
everything
i
afraid
i
was
a
cat
to
you
no
said
betty
it
was
right
and
brave
of
you
to
tell
me
the
whole
truth
oh
truth
the
only
thing
that
any
good
lady
craye
also
thought
it
a
useful
thing
in
moderation
she
rose
i
never
forget
what
you
doing
for
me
she
said
you
a
girl
in
thousand
look
here
my
dear
i
not
blind
do
think
i
value
what
you
doing
you
cared
for
him
in
england
a
little
and
you
care
a
little
now
and
everything
i
said
tonight
has
hurt
you
hatefully
and
you
did
know
you
cared
you
thought
it
was
friendship
did
you
till
you
thought
i
come
to
tell
you
that
something
had
happened
to
him
and
then
you
i
going
to
accept
your
sacrifice
i
got
to
i
ca
live
if
i
do
but
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
do
know
what
a
sacrifice
it
is
i
know
better
than
you
do
at
this
moment
no
do
say
anything
i
want
to
force
your
confidence
but
i
do
understand
i
wish
everything
was
different
said
betty
yes
you
thinking
are
you
that
if
it
had
been
for
vernon
you
rather
have
liked
me
and
i
know
now
that
if
it
been
for
him
i
should
have
been
very
fond
of
you
and
even
as
it
is
she
put
her
arms
round
betty
and
spoke
close
to
her
ear
you
doing
more
for
me
than
anyone
has
ever
done
for
me
in
my
life
she
said
more
than
i
do
for
you
or
any
woman
and
i
love
you
for
it
dear
brave
little
girl
i
hope
it
is
going
to
hurt
very
badly
i
love
you
for
it
and
i
never
forget
it
to
the
day
i
die
kiss
me
and
try
to
forgive
me
the
two
clung
together
for
an
instant
said
lady
craye
in
quite
a
different
voice
i
sorry
i
made
a
scene
but
really
sometimes
i
believe
one
is
quite
sane
let
me
write
the
grez
address
i
wish
i
could
think
of
any
set
of
circumstances
in
which
you
be
pleased
to
see
me
again
i
pack
said
betty
i
hope
be
happy
anyway
do
you
know
i
think
i
have
been
hating
you
rather
badly
without
quite
knowing
it
of
course
you
have
said
the
other
heartily
but
you
do
now
of
course
you
wo
leave
your
address
here
if
you
do
that
you
might
as
well
not
go
away
at
all
i
not
quite
a
fool
said
betty
no
said
the
other
with
a
sigh
it
i
that
am
the
fool
you
no
i
wo
say
what
you
are
but
well
good
night
dear
try
not
to
hate
me
again
when
you
come
to
think
it
all
over
quietly
chapter
xx
time
dear
vernon
this
is
to
thank
you
very
much
for
all
your
help
and
criticism
of
my
work
and
to
say
i
am
called
away
quite
suddenly
so
i
ca
thank
you
in
person
but
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
please
remember
me
to
lady
craye

be
married
quite
soon
now
and
i
am
sure
you
will
both
be
very
happy
yours
very
sincerely
elizabeth
desmond
this
was
the
letter
that
vernon
read
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
arch
by
the
concierge
window
the
concierge
had
hailed
him
as
he
hurried
through
to
climb
the
wide
shallow
stairs
and
to
keep
his
appointment
with
betty
when
she
should
leave
the
atelier
but
yes
mademoiselle
had
departed
this
morning
at
nine
to
which
station
to
the
gare
lazare
yes
mademoiselle
had
charged
her
to
remit
the
billet
to
monsieur
no
mademoiselle
had
not
left
any
address
but
perhaps
chez
madame
bianchi
but
chez
madame
bianchi
there
was
no
further
news
the
so
amiable
mademoiselle
desmond
had
paid
her
account
had
embraced
madame
and
voila
she
was
gone
one
divined
that
she
had
been
called
suddenly
to
return
to
the
family
roof
a
sudden
illness
of
monsieur
her
father
without
doubt
could
some
faint
jasmine
memory
have
lingered
on
the
staircase
or
was
it
some
subtler
echo
of
lady
craye
personality
that
clung
there
abruptly
as
he
passed
betty
door
the
suspicion
stung
him
had
the
jasmine
lady
had
any
hand
in
this
sudden
departure
pooh
nonsense
he
said
but
all
the
same
he
paused
at
the
concierge
window
i
am
desolated
to
have
deranged
madame
gold
coin
changed
a
lady
came
to
see
mademoiselle
this
morning
is
it
not
no
no
lady
had
visited
mademoiselle
no
one
at
all
in
effect
nor
last
night
very
late
no
monsieur
the
woman
answered
meaningly
no
visitor
came
in
last
night
except
monsieur
himself
and
he
came
not
to
see
mademoiselle
that
understands
itself
but
to
see
monsieur
beauchèsne
an
troisième
no
i
am
quite
sure
i
never
deceive
myself
and
mademoiselle
has
had
no
letters
since
three
days
thanks
a
thousand
times
monsieur
good
morning
she
locked
up
the
gold
piece
in
the
little
drawer
where
already
lay
the
hundred
franc
note
that
lady
craye
had
given
her
at
six
that
morning
and
there
be
another
fifty
from
her
next
month
she
chuckled
the
good
god
be
blessed
for
intrigues
without
intrigues
what
would
become
of
us
poor
concierges
for
vernon
paris
was
empty
the
spring
sunshine
positively
distasteful
he
did
what
he
could
he
enquired
at
the
gare
lazare
describing
betty
with
careful
detail
that
brought
smiles
to
the
lips
of
the
employés
he
would
not
call
on
miss
voscoe
he
made
himself
wait
till
the
sketch
club
afternoon
made
himself
wait
indeed
till
all
the
sketches
were
criticised
till
the
last
cup
of
tea
was
swallowed
or
left
to
cool
the
last
cake
munched
the
last
footfall
had
died
away
on
the
stairs
and
he
and
miss
voscoe
were
alone
among
the
scattered
blackened
and
torn
paper
then
he
put
his
question
miss
voscoe
knew
nothing
guessed
miss
desmond
knew
her
own
business
best
but
she
so
young
said
vernon
anything
might
have
happened
to
her
i
reckon
she
safe
enough
where
she
is
said
miss
voscoe
with
intention
but
have
you
any
idea
why
she
gone
he
asked
not
at
all
expecting
any
answer
but
not
the
least
but
miss
voscoe
said
i
have
a
quite
idea
and
so
have
you
he
could
but
beg
her
pardon
interrogatively
oh
you
know
well
enough
said
she
she
got
to
go
and
it
was
up
to
her
to
do
it
right
now
i
guess
vernon
had
to
ask
why
well
you
being
engaged
to
another
girl
do
you
surmise
it
might
kind
of
come
home
to
her
there
were
healthier
spots
for
you
than
the
end
of
her
apron
strings
maybe
she
thought
the
other
lady
apron
strings
be
suffering
for
a
little
show
i
not
engaged
said
vernon
shortly
then
it
time
you
were
the
answer
came
with
equal
shortness
you
pardon
me
making
this
a
talk
and
anyway
no
funeral
of
mine
but
she
the
loveliest
girl
and
i
right
down
like
her
so
you
take
it
from
me
that
lady
with
the
violets
oh
do
pretend
you
do
know
who
i
mean
the
one
you
always
about
with
when
you
are
with
betty
your
ticket
betty
not
your
friend
her
style
you
pass
this
hand
and
give
the
girl
a
chance
i
really
do
understand
i
bet
you
do
she
interrupted
with
conviction
i
sized
you
up
right
enough
vernon
you
no
fool
if
you
discontinued
your
engagement
betty
does
know
it
nor
she
sha
from
me
and
one
of
these
next
days
it
be
borne
in
on
your
friend
that
she
girl
of
his
life
and
when
he
meets
her
again
he
get
her
to
see
it
his
way
do
you
spoil
the
day
fishing
vernon
laughed
you
have
all
the
imagination
of
the
greatest
nation
in
the
world
miss
voscoe
he
said
thank
you
these
straight
talks
to
young
men
are
the
salt
of
life
you
have
all
the
obfuscation
of
the
stupidest
nation
in
the
world
she
retorted
if
you
had
had
you
have
had
a
chance
to
find
out
what
straight
talking
means
which
it
my
belief
you
never
have
yet
you
take
my
tip
either
you
go
back
to
where
you
were
before
you
sighted
betty
or
if
the
other
one
sick
of
you
too
just
shuffle
the
cards
take
a
fresh
deal
and
start
fair
you
go
home
and
spend
a
quiet
evening
and
think
it
all
over
vernon
went
off
laughing
and
wondering
why
he
did
hate
miss
voscoe
he
did
not
laugh
long
he
sat
in
his
studio
musing
till
it
was
too
late
to
go
out
to
dine
then
he
found
some
biscuits
and
sherry
remnants
of
preparations
for
the
call
of
a
picture
dealer
ate
and
drank
and
spent
the
evening
in
the
way
recommended
by
miss
voscoe
he
lay
face
downward
on
the
divan
in
the
dark
and
he
did
think
it
all
over
but
first
there
was
the
long
time
when
he
lay
quite
still
did
not
think
at
all
only
remembered
her
hands
and
her
eyes
and
her
hair
and
the
pretty
way
her
brows
lifted
when
she
was
surprised
or
perplexed
and
the
four
sudden
sweet
dimples
that
came
near
the
corners
of
her
mouth
when
she
was
amused
and
the
way
her
mouth
drooped
when
she
was
tired
i
want
you
i
want
you
i
want
you
said
the
man
who
had
been
the
amorist
i
want
you
dear
when
he
did
begin
to
think
he
moved
uneasily
in
the
dark
as
thought
after
thought
crept
out
and
stung
him
and
slunk
away
the
verses
he
had
written
at
long
barton
ironic
verses
written
with
the
tongue
in
the
cheek
came
back
with
the
force
of
iron
truth
i
love
you
to
my
heart
hid
core
those
other
loves
how
can
one
learn
from
marshlights
how
the
great
fires
burn
ah
no
i
never
loved
before
he
had
smiled
at
temple
confidences
when
betty
was
at
hand
to
be
watched
and
guarded
now
betty
was
away
anywhere
and
temple
was
deciding
whether
it
was
she
whom
he
loved
suppose
he
did
decide
that
it
was
she
and
as
miss
voscoe
had
said
made
her
see
it
damn
said
vernon
oh
damn
he
was
beginning
to
be
a
connoisseur
in
the
fine
flavours
of
the
different
brands
of
jealousy
anyway
there
was
food
for
thought
there
was
food
for
little
else
in
the
days
that
followed
vernon
heart
hungry
for
the
first
time
had
to
starve
he
went
often
to
lady
craye
she
was
so
gentle
sweet
yet
not
too
sympathetic
bright
amusing
even
but
not
too
vivacious
he
approved
deeply
the
delicacy
with
which
she
ignored
that
last
wild
interview
she
was
sister
she
was
friend
and
she
had
the
rare
merit
of
seeming
to
forget
that
she
had
been
confidante
it
was
he
who
the
subject
after
ten
days
she
had
told
herself
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
and
it
was
do
you
know
she
disappeared
he
said
abruptly
no
one
was
ever
more
astonished
than
lady
craye
quite
natural
the
astonishment
not
overdone
by
so
much
as
a
breadth
so
he
told
her
all
about
it
and
she
twisted
her
long
topaz
chain
and
listened
with
exactly
the
right
shade
of
interest
he
told
her
what
miss
voscoe
had
said
at
least
most
of
it
and
i
worry
about
temple
he
said
like
any
school
boy
i
worry
if
he
decide
that
he
loves
her
better
than
you
you
said
help
me
ca
you
make
sure
that
he
wo
love
her
better
i
could
i
suppose
she
admitted
to
herself
she
said
temple
at
grez
at
grez
they
been
there
ten
days
if
only
you
would
he
said
it
too
much
to
ask
i
know
but
i
ca
ask
anything
that
is
too
much
and
you
so
much
more
noble
and
generous
than
other
people
no
butter
thanks
she
said
it
the
best
butter
he
earnestly
urged
i
mean
that
i
mean
it
wo
you
when
i
see
him
again
but
it
not
very
fair
to
him
is
it
he
an
awfully
good
chap
you
know
said
vernon
innocently
and
once
more
lady
craye
bowed
before
the
sublime
apparition
of
the
egoism
of
man
good
enough
for
me
you
think
well
perhaps
you
right
he
a
dear
boy
one
would
feel
very
safe
if
one
loved
a
man
like
that
yes
would
one
said
vernon
she
wondered
whether
betty
was
feeling
safe
no
ten
days
are
a
long
time
especially
in
the
country
but
it
would
take
longer
than
that
to
cure
even
a
little
imbecile
like
betty
of
the
vernon
habit
it
was
worse
than
opium
who
ought
to
know
if
not
she
who
sat
calm
and
sympathetic
promising
to
entangle
temple
so
as
to
leave
betty
free
to
become
a
hopeless
prey
to
the
fell
disease
quite
suddenly
and
to
her
own
intense
surprise
she
laughed
out
loud
what
is
it
his
alert
vanity
bristled
in
the
query
it
nothing
only
everything
life
so
futile
we
pat
and
pinch
our
little
bit
of
clay
and
look
at
it
and
love
it
and
think
it
going
to
be
a
and
then
god
glances
at
it
and
he
does
like
the
modelling
and
he
sticks
his
thumb
down
and
the
whole
broken
up
and
there
nothing
left
to
do
but
throw
away
the
bits
oh
no
said
vernon
everything
bound
to
come
right
in
the
end
it
all
works
out
straight
somehow
she
laughed
again
optimism
from
you
it
not
optimism
he
asserted
eagerly
it
only
well
if
everything
does
come
right
somehow
somewhere
some
day
what
did
he
bother
to
make
the
world
for
that
exactly
what
i
said
my
dear
said
she
she
permitted
herself
the
little
endearment
now
and
then
with
an
ironical
inflection
as
one
fearful
of
being
robbed
might
show
a
diamond
pretending
that
it
was
paste
you
think
he
made
it
for
a
joke
if
he
did
it
a
joke
in
the
worst
possible
taste
said
she
but
i
see
your
point
of
view
there
ca
be
so
very
much
wrong
with
a
world
that
has
her
in
it
and
you
and
possibilities
do
you
know
he
said
slowly
i
not
at
all
sure
that
do
you
remember
the
chap
in
jane
eyre
he
knew
quite
well
that
that
rosamund
girl
would
make
him
the
wife
he
wanted
yet
he
wanted
nothing
else
i
do
want
anything
but
her
and
it
does
make
a
scrap
of
difference
that
i
know
exactly
what
sort
of
fool
i
am
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
does
keep
a
broken
bone
from
hurting
said
she
and
all
even
you
know
about
love
wo
keep
off
the
heartache
i
could
have
told
you
that
long
ago
i
know
i
a
fool
he
said
but
i
ca
help
it
sometimes
i
think
i
would
help
it
if
i
could
i
know
she
said
and
something
in
her
voice
touched
the
trained
sensibilities
of
the
amorist
he
stooped
to
kiss
the
hand
that
teased
the
topazes
dear
jasmine
lady
he
said
my
optimism
does
keep
its
colour
long
does
it
give
me
some
tea
wo
you
there
nothing
so
wearing
as
emotion
she
gave
him
tea
it
a
sort
of
judgment
on
you
though
was
what
she
gave
him
with
his
first
cup
you
dealt
out
this
very
thing
to
so
many
women
and
now
it
come
home
to
roost
i
did
know
what
a
fearful
wildfowl
it
was
he
answered
smiling
i
swear
i
did
i
begin
to
think
i
never
knew
anything
at
all
before
and
yet
they
say
love
blind
and
so
he
is
that
just
it
my
exotic
flower
of
optimism
withers
at
your
feet
it
all
exactly
the
muddle
you
say
it
is
pray
heaven
for
a
clear
way
out
meantime
thank
whatever
gods
may
be
i
got
monsieur
confidante
is
always
at
his
distinguished
service
she
said
and
thus
sealed
the
fountain
of
confidences
for
that
day
but
it
broke
forth
again
and
again
in
the
days
that
came
after
for
now
he
saw
her
almost
every
day
and
for
her
to
be
with
him
to
know
that
she
had
of
him
more
of
everything
save
the
heart
than
any
other
woman
spelled
something
wonderfully
like
happiness
more
like
it
than
she
had
the
art
to
spell
in
any
other
letters
vernon
still
went
twice
a
week
to
the
to
have
stayed
away
would
have
been
to
confess
to
the
whole
alert
and
interested
class
that
he
had
only
gone
there
for
the
sake
of
betty
those
afternoons
were
seasons
of
salutary
torture
he
tried
very
hard
to
work
but
though
he
still
remembered
how
a
paint
brush
should
be
handled
there
seemed
no
good
reason
for
using
one
he
had
always
found
his
planned
and
cultivated
emotions
strongly
useful
in
forwarding
his
work
this
undesired
unrest
mocked
at
work
and
at
all
the
things
that
had
made
up
the
solid
fabric
of
one
days
the
ways
of
love
he
had
called
it
love
it
was
a
name
like
another
had
merely
been
a
sort
of
such
love
was
the
intoxicant
necessary
to
transfigure
life
to
the
point
where
all
things
even
work
look
beautiful
now
he
tasted
the
real
draught
it
flooded
his
veins
like
fire
and
stung
like
poison
and
it
made
work
and
all
things
else
look
mean
and
poor
and
unimportant
i
want
you
i
want
you
i
want
you
said
vernon
to
the
vision
with
the
pretty
kitten
face
and
the
large
gray
eyes
i
want
you
more
than
everything
in
the
world
he
said
everything
in
the
world
put
together
oh
come
back
to
me
dear
dear
dear
he
was
haunted
without
cease
by
the
little
poem
he
had
written
when
he
was
training
himself
to
be
in
love
with
betty
i
love
you
to
my
heart
hid
core
those
other
loves
how
should
one
learn
from
marshlights
how
the
great
fires
burn
ah
no
i
never
loved
before
prophetic
i
suppose
he
said
though
god
knows
i
never
meant
it
any
fool
of
a
prophet
must
hit
the
bull
eye
at
least
once
in
a
life
but
there
was
a
curious
unanimity
of
prophecy
about
this
the
aunt
warned
me
that
conway
woman
warned
me
the
jasmine
lady
warned
me
and
now
it
happened
he
told
himself
and
i
who
thought
i
knew
all
about
everything
miss
conway
name
moving
through
his
thoughts
left
the
trail
of
a
new
hope
next
day
he
breakfasted
at
montmartre
the
neatest
little
crémerie
white
paint
green
walls
stenciled
with
fat
white
geraniums
on
each
small
table
a
vase
of
green
bruges
ware
or
breton
pottery
holding
not
a
crushed
crowded
bouquet
but
one
single
flower
a
pink
tulip
a
pink
carnation
a
pink
rose
on
the
desk
from
behind
which
the
proprietress
ruled
her
staff
enormous
pink
peonies
in
a
tall
pot
of
grez
de
flandre
behind
the
desk
paula
conway
incredibly
neat
and
her
black
hair
severely
braided
her
plain
black
gown
fitting
a
figure
grown
lean
as
any
her
lace
collar
a
marvel
of
fine
laundry
work
waitresses
in
black
with
white
aprons
served
the
customers
vernon
was
served
by
madame
herself
the
clientele
formed
its
own
opinion
of
the
cause
of
this
her
only
such
condescension
well
and
how
trade
he
asked
over
his
asparagus
trade
beautiful
paula
answered
with
the
frank
smile
that
betty
had
seen
only
once
or
twice
and
had
loved
very
much
if
trade
will
only
go
on
behaving
like
this
for
another
six
weeks
my
cruel
creditor
will
be
paid
every
penny
of
the
money
that
launched
me
her
eyes
dwelt
on
him
with
candid
affection
your
cruel
creditor
not
in
any
hurry
he
said
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
not
heard
anything
of
miss
desmond
how
could
i
you
know
you
made
me
write
that
she
was
to
write
i
did
you
write
anything
you
approved
but
anyway
she
has
my
address
why
she
gone
away
and
she
also
has
left
no
address
you
do
think
oh
no
nothing
have
happened
to
her
no
no
he
hastened
to
say
i
expect
her
father
sent
for
her
or
fetched
her
the
best
thing
too
said
paula
i
always
wondered
he
let
her
come
yes
vernon
remembered
how
little
paula
knew
oh
yes
she
probably
gone
home
look
here
said
miss
conway
very
earnestly
there
was
any
love
business
between
you
and
her
was
there
no
he
answered
strongly
i
was
always
afraid
of
that
do
you
know
if
you
do
mind
when
i
really
paid
my
cruel
creditor
everything
i
should
like
to
write
and
tell
her
what
he
done
for
me
i
should
like
her
to
know
that
she
really
save
me
and
how
because
if
it
had
been
for
her
never
have
thought
of
helping
me
do
you
think
i
might
it
could
do
no
harm
said
vernon
after
a
silent
moment
really
like
her
to
know
you
all
right
you
all
right
i
right
as
i
never
thought
i
could
be
ever
again
well
you
need
exaggerate
the
little
services
of
your
cruel
creditor
come
to
think
of
it
you
need
name
him
just
say
it
was
a
man
you
knew
but
when
paula
came
to
write
the
letter
that
was
not
just
what
she
said
book
the
other
man
chapter
xxi
the
flight
the
full
sunlight
streamed
into
the
room
when
betty
her
packing
done
drew
back
the
curtain
she
looked
out
on
the
glazed
roof
of
the
laundry
the
lead
roof
of
the
office
the
blank
wall
of
the
new
grocery
establishment
in
the
rue
de
rennes
only
a
little
blue
sky
shewed
at
the
end
of
the
lane
between
roofs
by
which
the
sun
came
in
not
a
tree
not
an
inch
of
grass
in
sight
only
in
her
room
half
a
dozen
roses
that
temple
had
left
for
her
and
the
white
marguerite
plant
tall
sturdy
a
little
tree
almost
that
vernon
had
sent
in
from
the
florist
next
door
but
two
everything
was
packed
she
would
say
to
madame
bianchi
and
she
would
go
and
leave
no
address
as
she
had
promised
last
night
why
did
you
promise
she
asked
herself
and
herself
replied
do
you
bother
we
talk
about
all
that
when
we
got
away
from
paris
he
was
quite
right
you
ca
think
here
you
better
tell
the
cabman
some
other
station
that
cat
of
a
concierge
is
sure
to
be
listening
ah
right
i
do
want
to
give
him
any
chance
of
finding
me
even
if
he
did
say
he
wanted
to
marry
me
a
fleet
lovely
picture
of
herself
in
bridal
smart
travelling
clothes
arriving
at
the
rectory
on
vernon
arm
are
you
sorry
you
misjudged
him
so
father
gentle
accents
refraining
from
reproach
a
very
pretty
picture
yes
dismissed
now
the
carriage
swaying
under
the
mound
of
betty
luggage
starts
for
the
gare
du
nord
in
the
rue
notre
dame
des
champs
betty
opens
her
mouth
to
say
gare
de
lyons
no
this
is
street
better
cross
it
as
quickly
as
may
be
at
the
church
of
germain
yes
the
coachman
smiles
at
the
new
order
like
the
concierge
he
scents
an
intrigue
whips
up
his
horse
and
swings
round
to
the
left
along
the
prettiest
of
all
the
boulevards
between
the
trees
past
thirion
ah
that
thought
or
pang
or
nausea
betty
does
quite
know
what
it
is
keeps
her
eyes
from
the
streets
till
the
carriage
is
crossing
the
river
why
there
is
notre
dame
it
ought
to
be
miles
away
suppose
vernon
should
have
been
leaning
out
of
his
window
when
she
passed
across
the
street
seen
her
divined
her
destination
followed
her
in
the
fleetest
carriage
accessible
the
vision
of
a
meeting
at
the
station
why
are
you
going
away
what
have
i
done
the
secret
of
this
her
great
renunciation
the
whole
life
sacrifice
to
that
idol
honor
wrung
from
her
a
hand
that
would
hold
hers
under
pretence
of
taking
her
bundle
of
rugs
to
she
wished
the
outermost
rug
were
less
shabby
vernon
voice
but
i
ca
let
you
go
why
ruin
two
lives
nay
three
for
it
is
you
only
that
i
dismissed
it
is
very
hot
paris
is
the
hottest
place
in
the
world
betty
is
glad
she
brought
lavender
water
in
her
bag
wishes
she
had
put
on
her
other
hat
this
brown
one
is
hot
and
besides
if
vernon
to
be
at
the
station
interval
dismissed
betty
has
never
before
made
a
railway
journey
alone
this
gives
one
a
forlorn
feeling
suppose
she
has
to
pay
excess
on
her
luggage
or
to
wrangle
about
contraband
she
has
heard
all
about
the
octroi
is
lavender
water
smuggling
and
what
can
they
do
to
you
for
it
vernon
would
know
all
these
things
and
if
he
were
going
into
the
country
he
would
be
wearing
that
rough
suit
of
his
and
the
panama
hat
a
rose
madame
abel
de
chatenay
would
go
well
with
that
coat
why
did
brides
consult
their
bridegrooms
before
they
bought
their
trousseaux
you
should
get
your
gowns
to
rhyme
with
your
suits
a
dream
of
a
dress
that
would
be
with
all
the
shades
of
madame
abel
cunningly
blended
a
honeymoon
lasts
at
least
a
month
the
roses
would
all
be
out
at
long
barton
by
the
time
they
walked
up
that
drive
and
stood
at
the
rectory
door
and
she
murmured
in
the
ear
of
the
reverend
cecil
are
you
sorry
you
dismissed
and
perforce
for
the
station
was
reached
betty
even
in
the
brown
hat
attracted
the
most
attractive
of
the
porters
also
of
course
the
most
attractable
he
thought
he
spoke
english
and
though
this
was
not
so
yet
the
friendly
blink
of
his
eyes
and
his
encouraging
smile
gave
to
his
bourron
mais
oui
dix
heures
vingt
par
ici
meess
je
de
vous
et
des
bagages
aussi
all
right
quite
the
ring
of
mother
tongue
he
made
everything
easy
for
betty
found
her
a
carriage
without
company
i
can
cry
here
if
i
like
said
the
betty
that
betty
liked
least
arranged
her
small
packages
neatly
in
the
rack
took
her
centime
piece
as
though
it
had
been
a
priceless
personal
souvenir
and
ran
half
the
length
of
the
platform
to
get
a
rose
from
another
porter
he
handed
it
to
her
through
the
carriage
window
égayer
le
voyage
de
all
right
he
smiled
and
was
gone
she
settled
herself
in
the
far
corner
and
took
off
her
hat
the
carriage
was
hot
as
any
kitchen
with
her
teeth
she
drew
the
cork
of
the
lavender
water
bottle
and
with
her
handkerchief
dabbed
the
perfume
on
forehead
and
ears
ah
mademoiselle
the
voice
came
through
the
open
window
beside
her
a
train
full
of
young
soldiers
was
beside
her
train
and
in
the
window
opposite
hers
three
boys
faces
crowded
to
look
at
her
three
hands
held
out
three
handkerchiefs
not
very
white
certainly
but
betty
smiling
reached
out
the
bottle
and
poured
lavender
water
on
each
outheld
handkerchief
le
bon
said
one
we
shall
think
of
the
beauty
of
an
angel
of
mademoiselle
every
time
we
smell
the
perfume
so
delicious
said
the
second
and
longer
than
that
oh
longer
than
that
by
all
a
life
cried
the
third
the
train
started
the
honest
smiling
boy
faces
disappeared
instinctively
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
to
look
back
at
them
all
three
threw
kisses
at
her
i
ought
to
be
offended
said
betty
and
instantly
kissed
her
hand
in
return
how
french
people
are
she
said
as
she
sank
back
on
the
hot
cushions
and
now
there
was
leisure
to
think
real
thoughts
not
those
broken
harassing
dreamings
that
had
buzzed
about
her
between
boulevard
montparnasse
and
the
station
also
as
some
one
had
suggested
one
could
cry
she
leaned
back
eyes
shut
her
next
thought
was
i
have
been
to
sleep
she
had
the
train
was
moving
out
of
a
station
labelled
fontainebleau
and
oh
the
trees
said
betty
the
green
thick
trees
and
the
sky
you
can
see
the
sky
through
the
carriage
window
she
drank
delight
from
the
far
grandeur
of
green
distances
the
intimate
beauty
of
green
rides
green
vistas
as
a
thirsty
carter
drinks
beer
from
the
cool
lip
of
his
can
a
thirsty
lover
madness
from
the
warm
lips
of
his
mistress
oh
how
good
how
green
and
good
she
told
herself
over
and
over
again
till
the
words
made
a
song
with
the
rhythm
of
the
blundering
train
and
the
humming
metals
bourron
her
station
little
quiet
sunlit
like
the
station
at
long
barton
a
flaming
broom
bush
and
the
white
of
may
and
acacia
blossom
beyond
prim
palings
no
platform
a
long
leap
to
the
dusty
earth
the
train
went
on
and
betty
and
her
boxes
seemed
dropped
suddenly
at
the
end
the
air
was
fresh
and
still
a
chestnut
tree
reared
its
white
blossoms
like
the
candles
on
a
christmas
tree
for
giant
children
the
white
dust
of
the
platform
sparkled
like
diamond
dust
may
trees
and
laburnums
shone
like
silver
and
gold
and
the
sun
was
warm
and
the
black
on
the
grass
and
betty
loved
it
all
she
said
suddenly
it
a
year
ago
since
i
met
in
the
warren
a
shadow
caressed
and
stung
her
she
would
have
liked
it
to
wear
the
mask
of
love
foregone
to
have
breathed
plaintively
of
hopes
defeated
and
a
broken
heart
instead
it
shewed
the
candid
face
of
a
real
homesickness
and
it
spoke
with
convincing
and
abominably
aggravating
plainness
of
long
barton
the
little
hooded
diligence
was
waiting
in
the
hot
white
dust
outside
the
station
but
it
is
i
who
transport
all
the
guests
of
madame
chevillon
said
the
smiling
bonnetless
woman
who
held
the
reins
betty
climbed
up
beside
her
along
a
straight
road
that
tall
ranks
of
trees
guarded
but
did
not
shade
through
the
patchwork
neatness
of
the
little
culture
that
makes
the
deep
difference
between
peasant
france
and
pastoral
england
down
a
steep
hill
into
a
little
white
town
where
vines
grew
out
of
the
very
street
to
cling
against
the
faces
of
the
houses
and
wistaria
hung
its
mauve
pendants
from
every
arch
and
lintel
the
hotel
chevillon
is
a
house
with
little
unintelligent
eyes
of
windows
burnt
blind
it
seems
in
the
sun
neat
with
the
neatness
of
provincial
france
out
shuffled
an
old
peasant
woman
in
short
skirt
heavy
shoes
and
big
apron
her
arms
bared
to
the
elbow
a
saucepan
in
one
hand
a
ladle
in
the
other
she
beamed
at
betty
i
wish
to
see
madame
chevillon
you
see
her
belle
et
chuckled
the
old
woman
it
is
me
madame
chevillon
you
will
rooms
is
it
not
you
are
artist
all
who
come
to
the
hotel
are
artist
rooms
marie
shall
show
you
the
rooms
at
the
instant
even
all
the
rooms
except
one
that
is
the
room
of
the
english
artist
all
that
there
is
of
most
amiable
but
quite
mad
he
wears
no
hat
and
his
brain
boils
in
the
sun
mademoiselle
can
chat
with
him
it
will
prevent
that
she
bores
herself
here
in
the
forest
betty
disliked
the
picture
i
think
perhaps
she
said
translating
mentally
as
she
spoke
that
i
should
do
better
to
go
to
another
hotel
if
there
is
only
one
man
here
and
he
is
she
saw
days
made
tiresome
by
the
dodging
of
a
lunatic
nights
made
tremulous
by
a
lunatic
yelling
soliloquies
ah
said
madame
chevillon
comfortably
i
thought
mademoiselle
was
artist
and
for
the
artists
and
the
spaniards
the
exist
not
but
mademoiselle
is
also
english
they
eat
the
convenances
every
day
with
the
see
then
my
cherished
the
english
man
he
is
not
a
dangerous
fool
only
a
beast
of
the
good
god
he
has
the
atelier
and
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
but
there
is
besides
the
hotel
the
garden
pavilion
un
appartement
of
two
rooms
exquisite
on
the
first
and
the
garden
room
that
opens
big
upon
the
terrace
it
is
there
that
mademoiselle
will
be
well
betty
thought
so
too
when
she
had
seen
the
rooms
exquisite
on
the
first
neat
bare
rooms
with
floors
scanty
rugs
and
frenchly
varnished
furniture
the
garden
room
too
with
big
open
hearth
and
no
furniture
but
wicker
chairs
and
tables
mademoiselle
can
eat
all
alone
on
the
terrace
the
english
mad
shall
not
approach
i
will
charge
myself
with
that
mademoiselle
may
repose
herself
here
as
on
the
bosom
of
the
mother
of
mademoiselle
betty
had
her
déjeuner
on
the
little
stone
terrace
with
rickety
rustic
railings
below
lay
the
garden
thick
with
trees
away
among
the
trees
to
the
left
an
arbour
she
saw
through
the
leaves
the
gleam
of
flannels
heard
the
chink
of
china
and
cutlery
there
no
doubt
the
mad
englishman
was
even
now
breakfasting
there
was
the
width
of
the
garden
between
them
she
sat
still
till
the
flannel
gleam
had
gone
away
among
the
trees
then
she
went
out
and
explored
the
little
town
she
bought
a
blue
packet
of
cigarettes
miss
voscoe
had
often
tried
to
persuade
her
to
smoke
most
of
the
girls
did
betty
had
not
wanted
to
do
it
any
more
for
that
she
had
had
a
feeling
that
vernon
would
not
like
her
to
smoke
and
in
paris
one
had
to
be
careful
but
now
i
am
absolutely
my
own
master
she
said
i
am
staying
by
myself
at
a
hotel
exactly
like
a
man
i
shall
feel
more
at
home
if
i
smoke
and
besides
no
one
can
see
me
it
just
for
me
and
it
shows
i
care
what
likes
lying
in
a
long
chair
reading
one
of
her
tauchnitz
books
and
smoking
betty
felt
very
manly
indeed
the
long
afternoon
wore
on
the
trees
of
the
garden
crowded
round
betty
with
soft
whispers
in
a
language
not
known
of
the
trees
on
the
boulevards
i
am
very
very
unhappy
said
betty
with
a
deep
sigh
of
delight
she
went
in
unpacked
arranged
everything
neatly
she
always
arranged
everything
neatly
but
nothing
ever
would
stay
arranged
she
wrote
to
her
father
explaining
that
madame
gautier
had
brought
her
and
the
other
girls
to
grez
for
the
summer
and
she
gave
as
her
address
chez
madame
chevillon
pavilion
du
jardin
grez
i
shall
be
very
very
unhappy
said
betty
that
night
laying
her
face
against
the
coarse
cool
linen
of
her
pillow
i
have
been
stunned
have
been
able
to
feel
anything
but
she
knew
would
be
golden
and
green
even
as
but
she
should
not
care
she
did
not
want
to
be
happy
how
could
she
be
happy
now
that
she
had
of
her
own
free
will
put
away
the
love
of
her
life
she
called
and
beckoned
to
all
the
thoughts
that
the
green
world
shut
out
and
they
came
at
her
call
fluttering
black
wings
to
hide
the
sights
and
sounds
of
field
and
wood
and
green
garden
and
making
their
nest
in
her
heart
yes
she
said
turning
the
hot
rough
pillow
now
it
begins
to
hurt
again
i
knew
it
would
it
hurt
more
than
she
had
meant
it
to
hurt
when
she
beckoned
those
thoughts
it
hurt
so
much
that
she
could
not
sleep
she
got
up
and
leaned
from
the
window
she
wondered
where
vernon
was
it
was
quite
early
not
eleven
lady
craye
had
called
that
quite
early
he
with
of
course
said
betty
sitting
at
her
feet
no
doubt
and
looking
up
at
her
hateful
eyes
and
holding
her
horrid
hand
and
forgetting
that
he
ever
knew
a
girl
named
me
betty
dressed
and
went
out
she
crossed
the
garden
it
was
very
dark
among
the
trees
it
would
be
lighter
in
the
road
the
big
yard
door
was
ajar
she
pushed
it
softly
it
creaked
and
let
her
through
into
the
silent
street
there
were
no
lights
in
the
hotel
no
lights
in
any
of
the
houses
she
stood
a
moment
hesitating
a
door
creaked
inside
the
hotel
she
took
the
road
to
the
river
i
wonder
if
people
ever
drown
themselves
for
love
said
betty
he
be
sorry
then
chapter
xxii
the
lunatic
the
night
kept
its
promise
betty
slipping
from
the
sleeping
house
into
the
quiet
darkness
seemed
to
slip
into
a
pool
of
oblivion
the
night
laid
fresh
cold
hands
on
her
tired
eyes
and
shut
out
many
things
she
paused
for
a
minute
on
the
bridge
to
listen
to
the
restful
restless
whisper
of
the
water
against
the
rough
stone
her
eyes
growing
used
to
the
darkness
discerned
the
white
ribbon
of
road
unrolling
before
her
the
trees
were
growing
thicker
this
must
be
the
forest
certainly
it
was
the
forest
how
dark
it
is
she
said
how
dear
and
dark
and
how
still
i
suppose
the
trams
are
running
just
the
same
along
the
boulevard
montparnasse
and
all
the
lights
and
people
and
the
noise
and
been
there
all
these
months
and
all
the
time
this
was
here
this
paris
was
going
on
all
that
muddle
and
maze
of
worried
people
and
she
was
out
of
it
all
here
alone
alone
a
quick
terror
struck
at
the
heart
of
her
content
an
abrupt
horrible
certainty
froze
her
the
certainty
that
she
was
not
alone
there
was
some
living
thing
besides
herself
in
the
forest
quite
near
her
something
other
than
the
deer
and
the
squirrels
and
the
quiet
dainty
woodland
people
she
felt
it
in
every
fibre
long
before
she
heard
that
faint
light
sound
that
was
not
one
of
the
forest
noises
she
stood
still
and
listened
she
had
never
been
frightened
of
the
dark
of
the
outdoor
dark
at
long
barton
she
had
never
been
afraid
even
to
go
past
the
in
the
dark
night
the
free
night
that
had
never
held
any
terrors
only
dreams
but
now
she
quickened
her
pace
and
yes
footsteps
came
on
behind
her
and
in
front
the
long
straight
ribbon
of
the
road
unwound
gray
now
in
the
shadow
there
seemed
to
be
no
road
turning
to
right
or
left
she
could
not
go
on
forever
she
would
have
to
turn
sometime
if
not
now
yet
sometime
in
this
black
darkness
and
then
she
would
meet
this
thing
that
trod
so
softly
so
stealthily
behind
her
before
she
knew
that
she
had
ceased
to
walk
she
was
crouched
in
the
black
between
two
bushes
she
had
leapt
as
the
deer
leaps
and
crouched
still
as
any
deer
her
dark
blue
linen
gown
was
one
with
the
forest
shadows
she
breathed
noiselessly
her
eyes
were
turned
to
the
gray
ribbon
of
road
that
had
been
behind
her
she
had
heard
now
she
would
see
she
did
see
something
white
and
tall
and
straight
oh
the
relief
of
the
tallness
and
straightness
and
whiteness
she
had
thought
of
something
dwarfed
and
clumsy
dark
misshapen
slouching
on
two
shapeless
feet
why
were
people
afraid
of
tall
white
ghosts
it
passed
it
was
a
man
in
a
white
suit
just
an
ordinary
man
no
not
ordinary
the
ordinary
man
in
france
does
not
wear
white
nor
in
england
except
for
boating
and
tennis
and
flannels
yes
the
lunatic
who
boiled
his
brains
in
the
sun
betty
terror
changed
colour
as
the
wave
changes
from
green
to
white
but
it
lost
not
even
so
much
of
its
force
as
the
wave
loses
by
the
change
it
held
her
moveless
till
the
soft
step
of
the
tennis
shoes
died
away
then
softly
and
hardly
moving
at
all
moving
so
little
that
not
a
leaf
of
those
friendly
bushes
rustled
she
slipped
off
her
shoes
took
them
in
her
hand
made
one
leap
through
the
crackling
protesting
undergrowth
and
fled
back
along
the
road
fleet
as
a
greyhound
she
ran
and
she
walked
very
fast
and
then
she
ran
again
and
never
once
did
she
pause
to
look
or
listen
if
the
lunatic
caught
her
well
he
would
catch
her
but
it
should
not
be
fault
if
he
did
the
trees
were
thinner
ahead
she
saw
glimpses
of
a
world
that
looked
quite
light
the
bridge
ahead
with
one
last
spurt
she
ran
across
it
tore
up
the
little
bit
of
street
slipped
through
the
door
and
between
the
garden
trees
to
her
pavilion
she
looked
very
carefully
in
every
corner
all
was
still
and
empty
she
locked
the
door
and
fell
face
downward
on
her
bed
vernon
in
his
studio
was
thinking
things
over
after
the
advice
of
miss
voscoe
in
much
the
same
attitude
oh
said
betty
i
will
never
go
out
at
night
again
and
i
will
leave
this
horrible
horrible
place
the
very
first
thing
morning
but
morning
touched
the
night
events
with
new
colours
from
its
shining
palette
after
all
even
a
lunatic
has
a
right
to
walk
out
in
the
forest
if
it
wants
to
she
told
herself
and
it
did
know
i
was
there
i
expect
really
but
i
think
i
go
and
stay
at
some
other
hotel
she
asked
when
her
complete
coffee
came
to
her
what
the
mad
gentleman
did
all
day
he
is
not
so
stupid
as
mademoiselle
supposes
said
marie
all
the
artists
are
insane
and
he
he
is
only
a
little
more
insane
than
the
others
he
is
not
a
real
mad
all
the
same
see
you
he
makes
drawings
at
montigny
which
way
is
montigny
asked
betty
and
learning
strolled
when
her
coffee
was
finished
by
what
looked
like
the
other
way
it
took
her
to
the
river
it
like
the
medway
said
betty
stooping
to
the
fat
cowslips
at
her
feet
only
prettier
and
i
never
saw
any
cowslips
here
you
dears
betty
would
not
look
at
her
sorrow
in
this
gay
glad
world
but
she
knew
at
last
what
her
sorrow
name
was
she
saw
now
that
it
was
love
that
had
stood
all
the
winter
between
her
and
vernon
holding
a
hand
of
each
in
her
blindness
she
had
called
it
friendship
but
now
she
knew
its
real
royal
name
she
felt
that
her
heart
was
broken
even
the
fact
that
her
grief
was
a
thing
to
be
indulged
or
denied
at
will
brought
her
no
doubts
she
had
always
wanted
to
be
brave
and
noble
well
now
she
was
being
both
a
turn
of
the
river
brought
to
sight
a
wide
reach
dotted
with
green
islands
each
a
tiny
forest
of
willow
saplings
and
young
alders
there
was
a
boat
moored
under
an
aspen
a
great
clumsy
boat
but
it
had
sculls
in
it
it
would
be
pleasant
to
go
out
to
the
islands
she
got
into
the
boat
loosened
the
heavy
rattling
chain
and
flung
it
in
board
took
up
the
sculls
and
began
to
pull
it
was
easy
work
i
did
know
i
was
such
a
good
oar
said
betty
as
the
boat
crept
swiftly
down
the
river
as
she
stepped
into
the
boat
she
noticed
the
long
river
reeds
straining
down
stream
like
the
green
hair
of
hidden
she
would
land
at
the
big
island
the
boat
steered
easily
and
lightly
enough
for
all
its
size
but
before
she
could
ship
her
oars
and
grasp
at
a
willow
root
she
shot
past
the
island
then
she
remembered
the
streaming
green
weeds
why
there
must
be
a
frightful
current
she
said
what
could
make
the
river
run
at
this
pace
a
weir
or
a
waterfall
she
turned
the
boat
nose
up
stream
and
pulled
ah
this
was
work
then
her
eyes
fixed
in
the
exertion
of
pulling
found
that
they
saw
no
moving
banks
but
just
one
picture
a
willow
a
clump
of
irises
three
poplars
in
the
distance
and
the
foreground
of
the
picture
did
not
move
all
her
pulling
only
sufficed
to
keep
the
boat
from
going
with
the
stream
and
now
as
the
effort
relaxed
a
little
it
did
not
even
do
this
the
foreground
did
move
the
wrong
way
the
boat
was
slipping
slowly
down
stream
she
turned
and
made
for
the
bank
but
the
stream
caught
her
broadside
on
whirled
the
boat
round
and
swept
it
calmly
and
gently
down
towards
the
weir
or
the
waterfall
betty
pulled
two
strong
strokes
driving
the
boat
nose
straight
for
the
nearest
island
shipped
the
sculls
with
a
jerk
stumbled
forward
and
caught
at
an
alder
stump
she
flung
the
chain
round
it
and
made
fast
the
boat
stern
swung
round
it
was
thrust
in
under
the
bank
and
held
there
close
the
chain
clicked
loudly
as
it
stretched
taut
well
said
betty
the
island
was
between
her
and
the
riverside
path
no
one
would
be
able
to
see
her
she
must
listen
and
call
out
when
she
heard
anyone
pass
then
they
would
get
another
boat
and
come
and
fetch
her
away
she
would
not
tempt
fate
again
alone
in
that
boat
she
was
not
going
to
be
drowned
in
any
silly
french
river
she
landed
pushed
through
the
saplings
found
a
mossy
willow
stump
and
sat
down
to
get
her
breath
it
was
very
hot
on
the
island
it
smelt
damply
of
wet
lily
leaves
and
iris
roots
and
mud
flies
buzzed
and
worried
the
time
was
very
long
and
no
one
came
by
i
may
have
to
spend
the
day
here
she
told
herself
it
not
so
safe
in
the
boat
but
it
not
so
either
and
still
no
one
passed
suddenly
the
soft
whistling
of
a
tune
came
through
the
hot
air
a
tune
she
had
learned
in
paris
deux
hi
cried
betty
in
a
voice
that
was
not
at
all
like
her
voice
help
she
added
on
second
thoughts
where
are
you
came
a
voice
how
alike
all
englishmen
voices
seemed
in
a
foreign
land
here
on
the
island
send
someone
out
with
a
boat
will
you
i
work
my
boat
a
bit
through
the
twittering
leaves
she
saw
something
white
waving
next
moment
a
big
splash
she
could
see
through
a
little
gap
a
white
blazer
thrown
down
on
the
bank
a
pair
of
sprawling
brown
boots
in
the
water
a
sleek
wet
round
head
an
arm
in
a
blue
shirt
sleeve
swimming
a
strong
side
stroke
it
was
the
lunatic
of
course
it
was
and
she
had
called
to
him
and
he
was
coming
she
pushed
back
to
the
boat
leaped
in
and
was
fumbling
with
the
chain
when
she
heard
the
splash
and
the
crack
of
broken
twigs
that
marked
the
landing
she
would
rather
chance
the
weir
or
the
waterfall
than
be
alone
on
that
island
with
a
maniac
but
the
chain
was
stretched
straight
and
stiff
as
a
lance
she
could
not
untwist
it
she
was
still
struggling
with
pink
fingers
bruised
and
when
something
heavy
crashed
through
the
saplings
and
a
voice
cried
close
to
her
drop
it
what
are
you
doing
and
a
hand
fell
on
the
chain
betty
at
bay
raised
her
head
lunatics
she
knew
could
be
quelled
by
the
calm
gaze
of
the
sane
human
eye
she
gave
one
look
and
held
out
both
hands
with
a
joyous
cry
oh
it
i
so
glad
where
did
you
come
from
oh
how
wet
you
are
then
she
sat
down
on
the
thwart
and
said
no
more
because
of
the
choking
feeling
in
her
throat
that
told
her
very
exactly
just
how
frightened
she
had
been
you
temple
was
saying
very
slowly
how
on
earth
where
are
you
staying
where
your
party
he
was
squeezing
the
water
out
of
sleeves
and
trouser
legs
i
have
got
a
party
i
staying
alone
at
a
hotel
just
like
a
man
i
know
you
frightfully
shocked
you
always
are
where
are
you
staying
he
asked
drawing
the
chain
in
hand
over
hand
till
a
loose
loop
of
it
dipped
in
the
water
hotel
chevillon
how
dripping
you
are
hotel
chevillon
he
repeated
never
then
it
was
what
was
me
that
i
was
to
last
night
in
the
forest
then
it
was
and
i
thought
it
was
the
lunatic
oh
if
i
only
known
but
why
did
you
come
after
me
if
you
did
know
it
me
temple
blushed
through
the
runnels
of
water
that
trickled
from
his
hair
i
well
madame
told
me
there
was
an
english
girl
staying
at
the
hotel
and
i
heard
some
one
go
out
and
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
i
thought
it
was
the
girl
and
i
just
well
if
anything
had
gone
wrong
a
drunken
man
or
anything
it
was
just
as
well
there
should
be
someone
there
do
you
know
that
very
very
nice
of
you
said
betty
but
oh
she
told
him
about
the
lunatic
oh
that
me
said
temple
i
recognise
the
portrait
especially
about
the
hat
he
had
loosened
the
chain
and
was
pulling
with
strong
even
strokes
across
the
river
towards
the
bank
where
his
coat
lay
we
land
here
if
you
do
mind
ca
you
pull
up
to
the
place
where
i
stole
the
boat
he
laughed
the
man
not
living
who
could
pull
against
this
stream
when
the
mill
going
and
the
lower
sluice
gates
are
open
how
glad
i
am
that
i
and
how
plucky
and
splendid
of
you
not
to
lose
your
head
but
just
to
hang
on
it
takes
a
lot
of
courage
to
wait
does
it
betty
thought
it
did
let
me
carry
your
coat
said
betty
as
they
landed
you
make
it
so
wet
he
stood
still
a
moment
and
looked
at
her
now
we
on
terra
cotta
he
said
let
me
remind
you
that
we
not
shaken
hands
oh
but
it
good
to
see
you
again
look
well
my
child
said
madame
chevillon
and
when
you
see
approach
the
meess
warn
me
that
i
may
make
the
little
omelette
at
the
instant
oh
la
la
madame
cried
marie
five
minutes
later
here
it
is
that
she
comes
and
the
mad
with
her
he
talks
with
her
in
laughing
she
carries
his
coat
and
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
has
any
hat
i
will
make
a
double
omelette
said
madame
give
me
still
more
of
the
eggs
the
english
are
all
mad
the
one
like
the
other
but
even
mads
must
eat
my
child
is
it
not
chapter
xxiii
temperatures
it
is
as
though
she
were
the
sort
of
girl
who
ca
take
care
of
herself
said
lady
craye
to
the
inward
monitor
who
was
buzzing
its
indiscreet
in
her
ear
i
really
done
her
a
good
turn
by
sending
her
to
grez
no
it
not
in
the
least
compromising
for
a
girl
to
stay
at
the
same
hotel
and
besides
there
are
lots
of
amusing
people
there
i
expect
she
have
a
delightful
time
and
get
to
know
that
temple
boy
really
well
i
sure
he
repay
investigation
if
i
were
a
besotted
fool
i
could
have
pursued
those
researches
myself
but
it
not
what
worth
having
that
one
wants
it
it
what
one
want
yes
that
all
paris
was
growing
intolerable
but
for
well
a
thousand
reasons
lady
craye
would
already
have
left
it
the
pavements
were
when
one
drove
it
was
through
an
air
like
the
breath
from
the
open
mouth
of
a
furnace
she
kept
much
within
doors
filled
her
rooms
with
roses
and
lived
with
every
window
open
her
balcony
too
was
full
of
flowers
and
the
striped
beyond
each
open
window
kept
the
rooms
in
pleasant
shadow
but
suppose
something
happens
to
her
all
alone
there
said
the
inward
monitor
nothing
will
she
not
that
sort
of
girl
her
headache
had
been
growing
worse
these
three
days
the
inward
monitor
might
have
had
pity
remembering
that
but
no
you
told
him
that
all
girls
were
the
same
sort
of
girls
said
the
pitiless
voice
i
did
mean
in
that
way
i
suppose
you
have
liked
me
to
write
that
anonymous
letter
and
restore
her
to
the
bosom
of
her
furious
family
i
done
the
girl
a
good
turn
for
what
she
did
for
me
a
good
little
thing
too
good
for
him
even
if
i
did
happen
to
and
temple
her
ideal
mate
i
wonder
if
he
found
it
out
yet
he
must
have
by
now
three
weeks
in
the
same
hotel
temple
however
was
not
in
the
same
hotel
the
very
day
of
the
river
rescue
and
the
double
omelette
he
had
moved
his
traps
a
couple
of
miles
down
the
river
to
montigny
a
couple
of
miles
is
a
good
distance
also
a
very
little
way
as
you
choose
to
take
it
you
know
it
was
a
mean
trick
said
the
inward
monitor
why
not
have
let
the
girl
go
away
where
she
could
be
alone
and
get
over
it
oh
be
quiet
said
lady
craye
i
never
knew
myself
so
tiresome
before
i
think
i
must
be
going
to
be
my
head
feels
like
an
ice
in
an
omelette
vernon
strolling
in
much
later
found
her
with
eyes
closed
leaning
back
among
her
flowers
as
she
had
lain
all
that
long
afternoon
how
pale
you
look
he
said
you
ought
to
get
away
from
here
yes
she
said
i
suppose
i
ought
it
would
be
easier
for
you
if
you
had
the
awful
responsibility
of
bringing
me
roses
every
other
day
what
these
are
she
dipped
her
face
in
the
fresh
pure
whiteness
of
the
ones
he
had
laid
on
her
knee
their
faces
felt
cold
like
the
faces
of
dead
people
she
shivered
heaven
knows
what
i
should
do
without
you
to
to
bring
my
my
roses
to
he
said
do
you
bring
me
anything
else
she
roused
herself
to
ask
any
news
for
instance
no
he
said
there
is
any
news
there
never
will
be
she
gone
home
i
certain
of
it
next
week
i
shall
go
over
to
england
and
propose
for
her
formally
to
her
a
very
proper
course
it
was
odd
that
talking
to
some
one
else
should
make
one
head
throb
like
this
and
it
was
so
difficult
to
know
what
to
say
very
odd
it
had
been
much
easier
to
talk
to
the
inward
monitor
she
made
herself
say
and
suppose
she
is
there
she
thought
she
said
it
rather
well
well
then
there
no
harm
done
he
does
like
you
she
was
glad
she
had
remembered
that
he
did
but
the
one
little
word
simply
spoken
is
a
magic
spell
for
taming
savage
relatives
they
eat
out
of
your
hand
after
that
at
least
so
i
told
it
was
awful
that
he
should
decide
to
do
this
but
it
did
not
seem
to
be
hurting
her
heart
that
felt
as
though
it
there
could
one
feel
emotion
in
one
hands
and
feet
hers
were
ice
cold
but
inside
they
tingled
and
glowed
like
a
worm
of
fire
in
a
chrysalis
of
ice
what
a
silly
simile
must
you
go
was
what
she
found
herself
saying
suppose
she
there
at
all
you
simply
be
giving
her
away
all
her
secret
and
he
fetch
her
home
that
at
least
was
quite
clearly
put
i
certain
she
is
at
home
he
said
and
i
do
see
why
i
am
waiting
till
next
week
i
go
if
you
are
pulling
a
rose
to
pieces
it
is
very
important
to
lay
the
petals
in
even
rows
on
your
lap
especially
if
the
rose
be
white
eustace
she
said
suddenly
feeling
quite
coherent
i
wish
you
would
go
away
from
paris
just
now
i
do
believe
you
find
her
i
have
a
feeling
that
she
not
far
away
i
think
that
is
quite
sensible
i
am
not
saying
it
because
i
and
i
feel
very
ill
eustace
i
think
i
am
oh
i
am
going
to
be
ill
very
ill
i
think
wo
you
wait
a
little
you
have
such
years
and
years
to
be
happy
in
i
do
want
to
be
ill
here
in
paris
with
no
one
to
care
she
was
leaning
forward
her
hands
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
for
the
first
time
that
day
he
saw
her
face
plainly
he
said
i
shall
go
out
now
and
wire
for
your
sister
not
for
worlds
i
forbid
it
she
drive
me
mad
no
but
my
running
round
like
a
beetle
on
a
pin
i
think
you
better
go
now
but
do
go
i
mean
i
think
i
go
to
sleep
i
feel
as
if
tumbled
off
the
eiffel
tower
and
been
caught
on
a
cloud
one
side
of
it
cold
and
the
other
blazing
he
took
her
hand
felt
her
pulse
then
he
kissed
the
hand
my
dear
tired
jasmine
lady
he
said
i
send
in
a
doctor
and
do
worry
i
wo
go
i
write
oh
very
well
she
said
write
then
and
it
will
all
come
out
about
her
being
here
alone
and
she
always
hate
you
care
what
you
do
i
suppose
i
can
write
a
letter
as
though
as
though
i
not
seen
her
since
long
barton
he
inwardly
thanked
her
for
that
hint
a
letter
written
from
paris
that
so
likely
is
it
but
do
what
you
like
do
care
what
you
do
she
was
faintly
agreeably
surprised
to
notice
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
it
rather
pleasant
do
you
know
she
went
on
dreamily
when
everything
that
matters
suddenly
goes
flat
and
you
wonder
what
on
earth
you
ever
worried
about
why
do
people
always
talk
about
cold
shivers
i
think
hot
shivers
are
much
more
amusing
it
like
a
skylark
singing
up
close
to
the
sun
and
doing
the
tremolo
with
its
wings
i
sorry
you
going
away
though
i
not
going
away
he
said
i
would
leave
you
when
you
ill
for
all
the
life
happinesses
that
ever
were
oh
why
ca
you
cure
me
i
do
want
to
want
her
i
want
to
want
you
i
certain
said
lady
craye
brightly
that
what
you
just
been
saying
most
awfully
interesting
but
i
like
to
hear
things
said
ever
so
many
times
then
the
seventh
time
you
understand
everything
and
the
coldness
and
the
hotness
turn
into
silver
and
gold
and
everything
is
quite
beautiful
and
i
think
i
am
not
saying
exactly
what
you
do
think
i
do
know
that
what
i
say
sounds
like
nonsense
i
know
that
quite
well
only
i
ca
stop
talking
you
know
one
is
like
that
sometimes
it
was
like
that
the
night
you
hit
me
i
he
was
kneeling
by
her
low
chair
holding
her
hand
as
she
lay
back
talking
quickly
in
low
even
tones
her
golden
eyes
shining
wonderfully
no
you
did
call
it
hitting
but
things
are
always
what
we
call
them
are
they
you
must
kiss
me
now
eustace
i
think
i
got
some
horrid
fever
i
sure
i
have
because
of
course
nobody
could
be
bewitched
nowadays
and
put
into
a
body
that
feels
thick
and
thin
in
the
wrong
places
and
my
head
too
big
to
get
through
the
of
course
i
know
it
is
it
would
be
funny
if
it
were
i
do
love
funny
so
do
you
i
like
to
hear
you
laugh
i
wish
i
could
say
something
funny
so
as
to
hear
you
laugh
now
she
was
holding
his
hand
very
tightly
with
one
of
hers
the
other
held
the
white
roses
all
her
mind
braced
itself
to
a
great
exertion
as
the
muscles
do
for
a
needed
effort
she
spoke
very
slowly
listen
eustace
i
am
going
to
be
get
a
nurse
and
a
doctor
and
go
away
perhaps
it
is
catching
and
if
i
fall
through
the
floor
she
added
laughing
it
is
so
hard
to
stop
put
your
arms
round
my
neck
he
said
for
she
had
risen
and
was
swaying
like
a
flame
in
the
wind
the
white
rose
leaves
fell
in
showers
i
do
think
i
want
to
now
she
said
astonished
that
it
should
be
so
oh
yes
you
do
he
spoke
as
one
speaks
to
a
child
put
your
arms
round
eustace
neck
your
own
eustace
that
so
fond
of
you
are
you
she
said
and
her
arms
fell
across
his
shoulders
of
course
i
am
he
said
hold
tight
he
lifted
her
and
carried
her
not
quite
steadily
for
carrying
a
woman
is
not
the
bagatelle
novelists
would
have
us
believe
it
he
opened
her
bedroom
door
laid
her
on
the
white
lacy
coverlet
of
her
bed
now
he
said
you
are
to
lie
quite
still
you
been
so
good
and
dear
and
unselfish
you
always
done
everything
i
asked
even
difficult
things
this
is
quite
easy
just
lie
and
think
about
me
till
i
come
back
he
bent
over
the
bed
and
kissed
her
gently
ah
she
sighed
there
was
a
flacon
on
the
table
by
the
bed
he
expected
it
to
be
jasmine
it
was
lavender
water
he
drenched
her
hair
and
brow
and
hands
that
nice
said
she
i
not
really
ill
i
think
it
nice
to
be
quite
still
do
you
mean
like
that
she
folded
her
hands
the
white
roses
still
clasped
the
white
bed
the
white
dress
the
white
flowers
horrible
yes
he
said
firmly
just
like
that
i
shall
be
back
in
five
minutes
he
was
not
gone
three
he
came
back
and
till
the
doctor
came
summoned
by
the
concierge
he
sat
by
her
holding
her
hands
covering
her
with
furs
from
the
wardrobe
when
she
shivered
bathing
her
wrists
with
perfumed
water
when
she
threw
off
the
furs
and
spoke
of
the
fire
that
burned
in
her
secret
heart
of
cold
clouds
when
the
doctor
came
he
went
out
by
that
excellent
direction
and
telegraphed
for
a
nurse
then
he
waited
in
the
cool
shaded
among
the
flowers
this
was
where
he
had
hit
her
as
she
said
there
on
the
divan
she
had
cried
leaning
her
head
against
his
sleeve
here
to
the
door
they
had
kissed
each
other
no
he
would
certainly
not
go
to
england
while
she
was
ill
he
felt
sufficiently
like
a
murderer
already
but
he
would
write
he
glanced
at
her
a
little
pang
pricked
him
and
drove
him
to
the
balcony
no
he
said
if
we
are
to
hit
people
at
least
let
us
hit
them
fairly
but
all
the
same
he
found
himself
playing
with
the
whose
solution
was
the
absolutely
right
letter
to
father
asking
her
hand
in
marriage
well
he
asked
the
doctor
who
closed
softly
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
came
forward
is
it
holy
ann
no
brain
fever
a
fell
disease
invented
by
novelists
i
never
met
it
in
all
experience
the
doctors
in
novels
have
special
advantages
no
it
influenza
pretty
severe
touch
too
she
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
days
ago
she
want
careful
looking
after
i
see
said
vernon
any
danger
there
always
danger
lord
is
it
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
lady
craye
husband
said
vernon
equably
i
was
merely
calling
and
she
seemed
so
ill
that
i
took
upon
myself
to
i
see
i
see
well
if
you
do
mind
taking
on
yourself
to
let
her
husband
know
it
a
nasty
case
temperature
perhaps
her
husband
be
as
well
here
as
anywhere
he
dead
said
vernon
oh
said
the
doctor
with
careful
absence
of
expression
get
some
woman
to
put
her
to
bed
and
to
stay
with
her
till
the
nurse
comes
she
in
a
very
excitable
state
good
afternoon
i
look
in
after
dinner
when
vernon
had
won
the
concierge
to
the
desired
service
had
seen
the
nurse
installed
had
dined
called
for
news
of
lady
craye
learned
that
she
was
très
he
went
home
pulled
a
table
into
the
middle
of
his
large
bare
hot
studio
and
sat
down
to
write
to
the
reverend
cecil
underwood
i
mean
to
do
it
he
told
himself
and
it
ca
hurt
my
doing
it
now
instead
of
a
month
ahead
when
she
well
again
in
fact
better
for
all
of
us
to
get
it
settled
one
way
or
another
while
not
caring
about
anything
so
he
wrote
and
he
wrote
a
great
deal
though
the
letter
that
at
last
he
signed
was
quite
short
my
dear
sir
i
have
the
honour
to
ask
the
hand
of
your
daughter
in
marriage
when
you
asked
me
most
properly
my
intentions
i
told
you
that
i
was
betrothed
to
another
lady
this
is
not
now
the
case
and
i
have
found
myself
wholly
unable
to
forget
the
impression
made
upon
me
last
year
by
miss
desmond
my
income
is
about
a
year
and
increases
yearly
i
beg
to
apologise
for
anything
which
may
have
annoyed
you
in
my
conduct
last
year
and
to
assure
you
that
my
esteem
and
affection
for
miss
desmond
are
lasting
and
profound
and
that
should
she
do
me
the
honour
to
accept
my
proposal
i
shall
devote
my
life
efforts
to
secure
her
happiness
i
am
my
dear
sir
your
obedient
servant
eustace
vernon
that
ought
to
do
the
trick
he
told
himself
talk
of
old
world
courtesy
and
ceremonial
anyhow
i
shall
know
whether
she
at
long
barton
by
the
time
it
takes
to
get
an
answer
if
it
two
days
there
if
it
longer
she
is
he
send
my
letter
on
to
her
unless
he
suppresses
it
your
really
pious
people
are
so
shockingly
unscrupulous
there
is
nothing
so
irretrievable
as
a
posted
letter
this
came
home
to
vernon
as
the
envelope
dropped
on
the
others
in
the
box
at
the
café
du
dóme
came
home
to
him
rather
forlornly
next
morning
he
called
with
more
roses
for
lady
craye
pinky
ones
this
time
milady
was
toujours
it
would
be
ten
days
at
the
least
before
milady
could
receive
even
a
very
old
friend
like
monsieur
the
letter
reached
long
barton
between
the
guardian
and
a
catalogue
of
some
rare
books
the
reverend
cecil
read
it
four
times
he
was
trying
to
be
just
at
first
he
thought
he
would
write
no
and
tell
betty
years
later
but
the
young
man
had
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
and
a
year
the
surprise
visit
with
which
the
reverend
cecil
had
always
intended
to
charm
his
suddenly
found
its
date
quite
definitely
fixed
this
could
not
be
written
he
must
go
to
the
child
and
break
it
to
her
very
gently
very
tenderly
find
out
quite
delicately
and
cleverly
exactly
what
her
real
feelings
were
girls
were
so
shy
about
those
things
miss
julia
desmond
had
wired
him
from
suez
that
she
would
be
in
paris
next
week
had
astonishingly
asked
him
to
meet
her
there
paris
next
tuesday
gare
lazare
come
and
see
betty
via
dieppe
had
been
her
odd
message
he
had
not
meant
to
go
not
next
tuesday
he
was
afraid
of
miss
julia
desmond
he
would
rather
have
his
lizzie
all
to
himself
but
now
he
wrote
a
cablegram
to
miss
julia
desmond
care
captain
urania
brindisi
will
meet
you
in
paris
then
he
thought
that
this
might
seem
to
the
telegraph
people
not
quite
nice
so
he
changed
it
to
going
to
see
lizzie
tuesday
the
fates
that
had
slept
so
long
were
indeed
waking
up
and
beginning
to
take
notice
of
betty
destiny
like
the
most
attractive
of
the
porters
at
the
gare
de
lyon
chapter
xxiv
the
confessional
the
concierge
sat
at
her
window
under
the
arch
of
the
at
boulevard
montparnasse
she
sat
gazing
across
its
black
shade
to
the
sunny
street
she
was
thinking
the
last
hours
had
given
food
for
thought
the
trams
passed
and
repassed
people
in
carriages
people
on
foot
the
usual
crowd
not
interesting
but
the
open
carriage
suddenly
drawn
up
at
the
other
side
of
the
broad
pavement
was
interesting
very
for
it
contained
the
lady
who
had
given
the
francs
and
had
promised
another
fifty
on
the
first
of
the
month
she
had
never
come
with
that
fifty
and
the
concierge
having
given
up
all
hope
of
seeing
her
again
had
acted
accordingly
lady
craye
pale
as
the
laces
of
her
cambric
gown
came
slowly
up
the
way
and
halted
at
the
window
good
morning
madame
she
said
i
bring
you
the
little
present
the
concierge
was
genuinely
annoyed
why
had
she
not
waited
a
little
longer
still
all
was
not
yet
lost
come
in
madame
she
said
madame
has
the
air
very
fatigued
i
have
been
very
ill
said
lady
craye
if
madame
will
give
herself
the
trouble
to
go
round
by
the
other
door
the
concierge
went
round
and
met
her
visitor
in
the
hall
and
brought
her
into
the
closely
furnished
little
room
with
the
high
wooden
bed
the
round
table
the
rack
for
letters
and
the
big
lamp
will
madame
give
herself
the
trouble
to
sit
down
would
it
be
permitted
to
offer
madame
something
a
little
glass
of
sugared
water
no
i
regret
infinitely
not
having
known
that
madame
was
suffering
i
should
have
acted
otherwise
what
have
you
done
she
asked
quickly
you
have
told
anyone
that
i
was
here
that
night
do
not
believe
it
for
an
instant
said
the
woman
reassuringly
after
madame
goodness
i
held
myself
wholly
at
the
disposition
of
madame
but
when
the
day
appointed
passed
itself
without
your
visit
i
said
to
myself
little
affaire
has
ceased
to
interest
this
lady
she
is
weary
of
it
my
grateful
heart
found
itself
free
to
acknowledge
the
kindness
of
others
tell
me
exactly
said
lady
craye
what
you
have
done
it
was
but
last
week
the
concierge
went
on
rearranging
a
stiff
bouquet
in
exactly
the
manner
of
an
embarrassed
ingénue
on
the
stage
but
only
last
week
that
i
received
a
letter
from
mademoiselle
desmond
she
sent
me
her
address
she
paused
lady
craye
laid
the
bank
note
on
the
table
madame
wants
the
address
i
have
the
address
i
want
to
know
whether
you
have
given
it
to
anyone
else
no
madame
said
the
concierge
with
simple
pride
when
you
have
given
a
thing
you
have
it
not
any
longer
well
pardon
me
have
you
sold
it
for
the
same
good
reason
no
madame
take
the
note
said
lady
craye
and
tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
the
address
this
gentleman
whom
madame
did
not
wish
to
know
that
she
had
been
here
that
night
i
did
wish
to
know
perfectly
this
gentleman
comes
without
ceasing
to
ask
of
me
news
of
mademoiselle
desmond
and
always
i
have
no
news
but
when
mademoiselle
writes
me
am
at
the
hotel
such
and
such
send
to
me
i
pray
you
letters
if
there
are
any
of
them
then
when
monsieur
makes
his
eternal
demand
i
reply
have
now
the
address
of
mademoiselle
not
to
give
but
to
send
her
letters
if
monsieur
had
the
idea
to
cause
to
be
expedited
a
little
billet
i
am
all
at
the
service
of
monsieur
so
he
wrote
to
her
have
you
sent
on
the
letter
alas
yes
replied
the
concierge
with
heartfelt
regret
i
kept
it
during
a
week
hoping
always
to
see
madame
but
yesterday
even
i
put
it
at
the
post
otherwise
i
beg
madame
to
have
the
goodness
to
understand
that
i
attach
myself
entirely
to
her
interests
you
may
rely
on
me
it
is
useless
said
lady
craye
the
affair
ceasing
to
interest
me
do
not
say
that
wait
only
a
little
till
you
have
heard
it
is
not
only
monsieur
that
occupies
himself
with
mademoiselle
last
night
arrives
an
aunt
also
a
father
they
ask
for
mademoiselle
are
consternated
when
they
learn
of
her
departing
they
run
all
paris
at
the
research
of
her
the
father
lodges
at
the
haute
loire
he
is
a
priest
it
appears
madame
the
aunt
occupies
the
ancient
apartment
of
mademoiselle
desmond
an
instant
said
lady
craye
let
me
reflect
the
concierge
ostentatiously
went
back
to
her
flowers
you
have
not
given
miss
desmond
address
madame
forgets
said
the
concierge
wounded
virtue
bristling
in
her
voice
that
i
was
for
the
moment
devoted
to
the
interest
of
monsieur
no
i
am
a
loyal
soul
i
have
told
only
to
despatch
the
letter
behold
all
i
will
give
myself
the
pleasure
of
offering
you
a
little
present
next
week
said
lady
craye
it
is
only
that
you
should
say
nothing
nothing
and
send
no
more
letters
and
the
address
madame
knows
it
by
what
she
says
yes
but
i
want
to
know
if
the
address
you
have
is
the
same
that
i
have
hotel
chevillon
grez
sur
loing
is
it
so
it
is
exact
i
thank
you
madame
madame
would
do
well
to
return
and
to
repose
herself
a
little
madame
is
all
pale
is
the
aunt
in
miss
desmond
rooms
now
yes
she
writes
letters
without
end
and
telegrams
and
the
he
runs
with
them
like
a
sad
old
black
dog
that
has
not
the
habit
of
towns
i
shall
go
up
and
see
her
said
lady
craye
and
i
shall
most
likely
give
her
the
address
but
do
not
give
yourself
anxiety
you
will
gain
more
by
me
than
by
any
of
the
others
they
are
not
rich
me
i
am
heaven
be
praised
she
went
out
and
along
the
courtyard
at
the
foot
of
the
wide
shallow
stairs
she
paused
and
leaned
on
the
dusty
banisters
i
feel
as
weak
as
any
rat
she
said
but
i
must
go
through
with
it
i
must
she
climbed
the
stairs
and
stood
outside
the
brown
door
the
nails
that
had
held
the
little
card
miss
desmond
still
stuck
there
but
only
four
corners
of
the
card
remained
the
door
was
not
shut
it
always
shut
unwillingly
she
tapped
come
in
said
a
clear
pleasant
voice
and
she
went
in
the
room
was
not
as
she
had
seen
it
on
the
two
occasions
when
it
had
been
the
battle
ground
where
she
and
betty
fought
for
a
man
plaid
covered
the
divans
a
watch
in
a
leather
bracelet
ticked
on
the
table
among
scattered
stationery
a
lady
in
a
short
sensible
dress
rose
from
the
table
and
the
room
was
scented
with
the
smell
of
hungarian
cigarettes
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
it
was
my
did
you
call
to
see
miss
desmond
she
is
away
for
a
short
time
yes
said
lady
craye
i
know
i
wanted
to
see
you
the
concierge
told
me
oh
these
concierges
they
tell
everything
it
what
they
were
invented
for
i
believe
and
you
wanted
she
stopped
looked
hard
at
the
young
woman
and
went
on
what
you
want
is
a
good
stiff
brandy
and
soda
here
where
the
head
of
the
pin
i
always
think
it
such
a
pity
bonnets
went
out
one
could
undo
strings
that
it
now
put
your
feet
up
that
right
i
be
back
in
half
a
minute
lady
craye
found
herself
lying
at
full
length
on
betty
divan
her
feet
covered
with
a
tussore
her
hat
on
a
table
at
some
distance
she
closed
her
eyes
it
was
just
as
well
she
could
get
back
a
little
strength
she
could
try
to
arrange
coherently
what
she
meant
to
say
no
it
was
not
unfair
to
the
girl
she
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
and
besides
there
was
no
such
thing
as
unfair
all
was
fair
in
well
she
was
righting
for
her
life
all
was
fair
when
one
was
fighting
for
one
life
that
was
what
she
meant
meantime
to
lie
quite
still
and
draw
long
even
breaths
telling
oneself
at
each
breath
i
am
quite
well
i
am
quite
strong
seemed
best
there
was
a
sound
a
dull
plop
the
hiss
and
fizzle
of
a
spurting
syphon
then
drink
this
that
right
i
got
you
a
strong
arm
round
her
shoulders
something
buzzing
and
spitting
in
a
glass
under
her
nose
drink
it
up
there
a
good
child
she
drank
a
long
breath
now
the
rest
she
was
obedient
now
shut
your
eyes
and
do
bother
when
you
better
we
talk
silence
save
for
the
fierce
scratching
of
a
pen
i
better
announced
lady
craye
as
the
pen
paused
for
the
folding
of
the
third
letter
the
short
skirted
woman
came
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
divan
very
upright
well
then
you
ought
to
be
out
you
poor
little
thing
the
words
brought
the
tears
to
the
eyes
of
one
weak
with
the
weakness
of
convalescence
i
wanted
are
you
a
friend
of
betty
yes
no
i
do
know
a
hated
rival
perhaps
said
the
elder
woman
cheerfully
you
come
to
do
her
a
good
turn
anyhow
did
you
i
i
do
know
again
this
was
all
that
would
come
i
do
though
well
which
of
us
is
to
begin
you
see
child
the
difficulty
is
that
we
neither
of
us
know
how
much
the
other
knows
and
we
do
want
to
give
ourselves
away
it
so
awkward
to
talk
when
it
like
that
i
think
i
know
more
than
you
do
i
you
need
think
i
want
to
hurt
her
i
should
have
liked
her
awfully
if
it
had
been
if
it
had
been
for
the
man
yes
i
see
who
was
he
lady
craye
felt
absolutely
defenceless
besides
what
did
it
matter
vernon
she
said
ah
now
we
getting
to
the
horses
my
dear
child
do
look
so
guilty

not
the
first
you
wo
be
the
last
especially
with
eyes

colour
his
are
and
so
you
hate
betty

i
do
i
should
like
to
tell
you
all
about
it
all
the
truth
you
ca
said
miss
desmond
no
woman
can
but
i
give
you
credit
for
trying
to
if
you
go
straight
ahead
but
first
of
all
how
long
is
it
since
you
saw
her
nearly
a
month
well
she
disappeared
her
father
and
i
got
here
last
night
gone
away
and
left
no
address
she
was
living
with
a
madame
gautier
and
madame
gautier
died
last
october
said
lady
craye
the
i
had
a
letter
from
her
brother
it
got
me
in
bombay
but
i
believe
it
and
who
has
betty
been
living
with
look
here
said
lady
craye
i
came
to
give
the
whole
thing
away
and
hand
her
over
to
you
i
know
where
she
is
but
now
i
want
to
her
father
a
brute
i
know
not
he
said
miss
desmond
he
only
a
man
and
a
very
very
silly
one
i
pledge
you
my
word
he
never
approach
her
whatever
done
it
not
anything
too
awful
for
words
i
certain
come
tell
me
lady
craye
told
betty
secret
at
some
length
did
she
tell
you
this
no
he
did
then
yes
oh
men
are
darlings
the
soul
of
honour
unsullied
blades
my
word
do
you
mind
if
i
smoke
she
lighted
a
cigarette
i
suppose
very
dishonourable
too
said
lady
craye
you
oh
no
you
only
a
woman
and
then
well
at
last
i
asked
her
to
go
away
and
she
went
well
that
was
decent
of
her
was
it
yes
and
now
you
going
to
tell
me
where
she
is
and
i
to
take
her
home
and
keep
her
out
of
his
way
is
that
it
i
do
know
said
lady
craye
very
truly
why
i
came
to
you
at
all
because
it
all
no
good
he
written
and
proposed
for
her
to
her
father
and
if
she
cares
well
if
she
cares
and
he
cares
do
you
really
mean
that
care
to
marry
a
man
who
in
love
with
another
woman
i
marry
him
if
he
was
in
love
with
fifty
other
women
in
that
case
said
miss
desmond
i
should
say
you
were
the
very
wife
for
him
is
said
lady
craye
sitting
up
i
feel
like
a
silly
talking
to
you
like
this
i
think
i
go
now
i
not
really
so
silly
as
i
seem
i
been
ill
influenza
you
know
and
i
got
so
frightfully
tired
and
i
do
think
i
so
strong
as
i
used
to
be
i
always
thought
i
was
strong
enough
to
play
any
part
i
wanted
to
play
but
you
been
very
kind
i
go
she
lay
back
do
be
silly
said
miss
desmond
briskly
you
a
compared
with
me
you
know
i
suppose
you
been
trying
to
play
the
rôle
of
the
designing
heroine
to
part
true
lovers
and
so
on
and
then
you
found
you
could
they
true
lovers
said
lady
craye
eagerly
that
just
it
she
never
make
him
happy
she
too
young
and
too
innocent
and
when
she
found
out
what
a
man
like
him
is
like
she
break
her
heart
and
he
told
me
he
be
happier
with
me
than
he
ever
had
been
with
her
was
that
true
or
oh
yes
it
was
true
enough
though
he
said
it
you
met
him
he
told
me
but
you
do
know
him
i
know
his
kind
though
said
miss
desmond
and
so
you
love
him
very
much
indeed
and
you
do
care
for
anything
else
and
you
think
you
understand
him
and
you
could
forgive
him
everything
then
you
may
get
him
yet
if
you
care
so
very
much
that
is
if
betty
does
she
does
she
thinks
she
does
but
she
does
if
only
he
written
to
her
my
dear
said
miss
desmond
i
was
a
fool
myself
once
about
a
man
with
eyes
his
colour
you
ca
tell
me
anything
that
i
do
know
does
he
know
how
much
you
care
yes
ah
that
a
pity
still
well
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
tell
me
i
do
want
to
tell
anyone
anything
only
when
she
said
she
go
away
i
advised
her
where
to
go
and
i
told
her
of
a
quiet
place
and
temple
there
he
the
other
man
who
admires
her
i
see
how
machiavelian
of
you
miss
desmond
touched
the
younger
woman
hand
with
brusque
gentleness
and
and
i
did
quite
tell
her
the
truth
about
vernon
and
me
said
lady
craye
wallowing
in
the
abject
joys
of
the
confessional
and
i
am
a
beast
and
not
fit
to
live
but
she
added
with
the
true
penitent
instinct
of
i
it
only
oh
i
know
what
not
love
with
her
and
it
my
life
yes
and
what
about
him
it
not
love
with
him
at
least
it
is
but
she
bore
him
really
his
time
he
been
playing
the
game
just
for
counters
all
the
while
now
he
learning
to
play
with
gold
and
it
stay
learnt
i
see
said
miss
desmond
look
here
i
like
you
i
know
we
should
have
said
all
we
have
if
you
were
ill
and
i
were
anxious
but
i
with
you
in
one
thing
i
do
want
him
to
marry
betty
she
would
understand
an
artist
in
emotion
is
this
temple
straight
as
a
yardstick
and
as
wooden
well
that
better
i
on
your
side
but
we
been
talking
without
the
veils
on
tell
me
one
thing
are
you
sure
you
could
get
him
if
betty
were
out
of
the
way
he
kissed
me
once
since
he
loved
her
said
lady
craye
and
then
i
knew
i
could
he
liked
me
better
than
he
liked
her
in
all
the
other
ways
before
i
a
shameless
idiot
it
really
only
because
i
so
feeble
she
rose
and
stood
before
the
glass
putting
on
her
hat
i
do
respect
a
woman
who
has
the
courage
to
speak
the
truth
to
another
woman
said
miss
desmond
i
hope
you
get
him
though
not
a
very
kind
wish
lady
craye
let
herself
go
completely
in
a
phrase
whose
memory
stung
and
rankled
for
many
a
long
day
ah
she
said
even
if
he
gets
tired
of
me
i
shall
have
got
his
children
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
want
a
child
said
miss
desmond
no
of
course
i
do
chapter
xxv
the
forest
nothing
lifts
the
heart
like
the
sense
of
a
great
nobly
made
betty
was
glad
that
she
could
feel
so
particularly
noble
it
was
a
great
help
he
was
mine
she
told
herself
he
meant
to
be
and
i
have
given
him
up
to
her
it
hurts
yes
but
i
did
the
right
thing
she
thought
she
hoped
that
he
would
soon
forget
her
and
almost
all
that
was
betty
tried
quite
sincerely
snatching
at
every
help
to
forget
him
sometimes
the
betty
that
betty
did
not
want
to
be
would
quite
deliberately
and
of
set
purpose
take
out
the
nest
of
hungry
memories
look
at
them
play
with
them
and
hand
over
her
heart
for
them
to
feed
on
but
always
when
she
had
done
this
she
felt
afterwards
a
little
sorry
a
little
ashamed
it
was
too
like
the
diary
at
long
barton
consciously
or
unconsciously
one
must
make
some
concessions
to
every
situation
or
every
situation
would
be
impossible
temple
was
here
interested
pleased
to
see
her
glad
to
talk
to
her
but
he
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
be
in
love
with
her
that
had
been
only
a
silly
fancy
of
hers
in
paris
he
had
made
up
his
mind
by
now
who
it
was
that
he
cared
for
and
it
was
betty
probably
she
had
even
been
one
of
the
two
he
came
to
grez
to
think
about
he
was
only
a
good
friend
and
she
wanted
a
good
friend
if
he
were
not
just
a
good
friend
the
situation
would
be
impossible
and
betty
chose
that
the
situation
should
be
possible
for
it
was
pleasant
it
was
a
shield
and
a
shelter
from
all
the
thoughts
that
she
wanted
to
hide
from
if
she
thinks
i
going
to
break
my
heart
about
mistaken
and
so
he
i
must
be
miserable
for
a
bit
said
betty
bravely
but
i
not
be
miserable
forever
so
he
need
think
it
of
course
i
shall
never
care
for
anyone
ever
again
unless
he
were
to
love
me
for
years
and
years
before
he
ever
said
a
word
and
then
i
might
say
i
would
try
but
fall
in
love
never
again
oh
good
gracious
there
he
is
and
i
not
to
get
ready
temple
was
whistling
very
softly
in
the
courtyard
below
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
i
sha
be
two
minutes
she
said
you
might
get
the
basket
from
madame
and
my
sketching
things
are
on
the
terrace
all
ready
strapped
up
the
hoofs
of
the
smart
gray
pony
slipped
and
rattled
on
the
of
the
hotel
entry
au
revoir
amuse
yourselves
well
my
children
madame
chevillon
stood
one
hand
on
fat
hip
the
other
shading
old
eyes
that
they
might
watch
the
progress
of
the
cart
up
the
blinding
whiteness
of
the
village
street
to
the
forest
and
yet
again
to
the
forest
and
to
the
forest
always
she
said
turning
into
the
darkened
billiard
room
marie
beware
thou
of
the
forest
the
good
god
created
it
express
for
the
lovers
but
it
is
permitted
to
the
devil
to
promenade
himself
there
also
those
two
there
said
marie
it
is
very
certain
that
they
are
in
love
how
otherwise
said
madame
the
good
god
made
us
women
that
the
men
should
be
in
love
with
us
and
afterwards
to
take
care
of
the
children
there
is
no
other
use
that
a
man
has
for
a
woman
friendship
the
art
bah
when
a
man
wants
those
he
demands
them
of
a
man
of
a
woman
he
demands
but
love
and
one
gives
it
to
him
one
gives
it
to
him
without
question
the
two
who
had
departed
for
the
forest
drove
on
through
the
swimming
spinning
heat
in
silence
it
was
not
till
they
reached
the
little
old
well
by
marlotte
that
betty
spoke
do
let
work
temple
she
said
my
hands
are
so
hot
i
could
never
hold
a
brush
and
your
sketch
is
really
finished
you
know
what
would
you
like
to
do
asked
temple
river
oh
no
not
now
that
we
started
for
the
forest
its
feelings
would
be
hurt
if
we
turned
back
i
am
sure
it
loves
us
to
love
it
although
it
is
so
big
like
god
you
know
yes
i
sure
it
does
do
you
really
think
god
cares
of
course
said
betty
because
everything
would
be
so
silly
if
he
did
you
know
i
believe
he
likes
us
to
love
him
and
what
more
i
believe
he
likes
us
to
love
all
the
pretty
things
he
made
trees
and
rivers
and
sunsets
and
seas
and
each
other
said
temple
and
flushed
to
the
ears
human
beings
i
mean
of
course
he
added
hastily
of
course
said
betty
unconscious
of
the
flush
but
religion
tells
you
that
it
does
tell
you
about
the
little
things
it
does
say
about
herbs
of
the
field
and
the
floods
clapping
their
hands
and
all
that
but
that
only
his
works
praising
him
not
us
loving
all
his
works
i
think
he
most
awfully
pleased
when
we
love
some
little
nice
tiny
thing
that
he
never
thought
we
notice
did
your
father
teach
you
to
think
like
this
oh
dear
no
said
betty
he
does
like
the
little
pretty
things
it
odd
said
temple
look
at
those
yellow
roses
all
over
that
hideous
villa
my
would
only
see
the
villa
well
must
we
work
what
would
you
like
to
do
i
should
like
to
go
to
those
big
rocks
the
rochers
des
demoiselles
are
they
and
tie
up
the
pony
and
climb
up
and
sit
in
a
black
shadow
and
look
out
over
the
green
tops
of
the
trees
you
see
things
when
you
idle
that
you
never
see
when
you
working
even
if
you
trying
to
paint
those
very
things
so
by
and
by
the
gray
pony
was
unharnessed
and
tied
to
a
tree
in
a
cool
grassy
place
where
he
also
could
be
happy
and
the
two
others
took
the
winding
stony
path
a
turn
in
the
way
brought
them
to
a
platform
overhanging
the
precipice
that
fell
a
sheer
thirty
feet
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
on
the
slope
below
white
silvery
sand
carpeted
the
ledge
and
on
the
sand
the
shadow
of
a
leaning
rock
fell
blue
here
said
betty
and
sank
down
her
sketchbook
scooped
the
sand
with
its
cover
oh
i
hot
she
threw
off
her
hat
you
do
look
it
said
temple
and
pulled
the
big
bottle
of
weak
claret
and
water
from
the
luncheon
basket
drink
he
said
offering
the
little
glass
when
he
had
filled
it
betty
drank
in
little
sips
how
extraordinarily
nice
it
is
to
drink
when
you
thirsty
she
said
and
how
heavenly
this
shadow
is
a
long
silence
temple
filled
and
lighted
a
pipe
from
a
slope
of
dry
grass
a
little
below
them
came
the
dusty
rattle
of
grasshoppers
talk
it
is
very
good
here
said
betty
oh
how
glad
i
am
i
came
away
from
paris
everything
looks
different
here
i
mean
the
things
that
look
as
if
they
mattered
there
do
matter
here
and
the
things
that
did
matter
there
oh
here
they
do
yes
said
temple
making
little
mounds
of
sand
with
the
edge
of
his
hand
as
he
lay
i
never
expected
to
have
such
days
in
this
world
as
i
had
here
with
you
we
grown
to
be
very
good
friends
here
have
we
we
were
very
good
friends
in
paris
said
betty
remembering
the
letter
that
had
announced
his
departure
but
it
was
the
same
he
persisted
when
did
we
talk
in
paris
as
we
talked
here
i
talked
to
you
even
in
paris
more
than
i
ever
talked
to
anyone
else
all
the
same
said
betty
thank
you
he
said
that
the
nicest
thing
you
ever
said
to
me
it
was
meant
to
be
nice
said
betty
it
true
do
you
know
there
are
some
people
you
never
can
talk
to
without
wondering
what
they
think
of
you
and
whether
you
had
better
have
said
something
else
it
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
like
them
or
not
she
went
on
thinking
of
talks
with
vernon
many
talks
and
in
all
of
them
she
had
been
definitely
and
consciously
on
guard
you
may
like
people
quite
frightfully
and
yet
you
ca
talk
to
them
yes
he
said
but
you
could
talk
to
a
person
you
disliked
could
you
real
talk
i
mean
of
course
not
said
betty
do
you
know
i
dreadfully
hungry
it
was
after
lunch
that
temple
said
when
are
you
going
home
miss
desmond
she
looked
up
for
his
use
of
her
name
was
rare
i
do
know
some
time
she
answered
absently
but
the
question
ran
through
her
mind
like
a
needle
drawing
after
it
the
thread
on
which
were
strung
all
the
little
longings
for
long
barton
for
the
familiar
fields
and
flowers
that
had
gathered
there
since
she
first
saw
the
silver
may
and
the
golden
broom
at
bourron
station
that
was
nearly
a
month
ago
what
a
month
it
had
been
the
gleaming
river
the
neat
intimate
simplicity
of
the
little
culture
white
roads
and
roses
and
rocks
and
more
than
all
trees
and
trees
and
trees
again
and
with
all
this
temple
he
lodged
at
montigny
true
and
she
at
grez
but
each
day
brought
to
her
door
the
best
companion
in
the
world
he
had
never
even
asked
how
she
came
to
be
at
grez
after
that
first
where
your
party
he
had
guarded
his
lips
it
had
seemed
so
natural
and
so
extremely
fortunate
that
he
should
be
here
if
she
had
been
all
alone
she
would
have
allowed
herself
to
think
too
much
of
vernon
of
what
might
have
been
i
am
going
to
england
next
week
he
said
betty
was
shocked
to
perceive
that
this
news
hurt
her
well
why
should
it
hurt
her
she
was
absolutely
insensible
to
friendship
she
supposed
and
sensibility
to
friendship
was
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
on
the
contrary
i
shall
miss
you
most
awfully
said
she
with
the
air
of
one
flaunting
a
flag
i
wish
you
go
home
he
said
have
you
had
enough
of
your
experiment
or
whatever
it
was
yet
i
thought
you
given
up
interfering
she
said
crossly
at
least
she
meant
to
speak
crossly
i
thought
i
could
say
anything
to
you
now
without
your
your
not
understanding
so
you
can
she
was
suddenly
not
cross
again
ah
no
i
ca
he
said
i
want
to
say
things
to
you
that
i
say
here
wo
you
go
home
wo
you
let
me
come
to
see
you
there
say
i
may
you
will
let
me
if
she
said
yes
she
refused
to
pursue
that
train
of
thought
another
inch
if
she
said
no
then
a
sudden
end
and
forever
an
end
to
this
good
companionship
i
wish
i
had
never
never
seen
she
told
herself
then
she
found
that
she
was
speaking
the
reason
i
was
all
alone
in
paris
she
was
saying
the
reason
took
a
long
time
to
the
shadow
withdrew
itself
and
they
had
to
shift
the
camp
just
when
it
came
to
the
part
about
betty
first
meeting
with
temple
himself
and
so
she
said
i
done
what
i
meant
to
do
and
i
a
hateful
liar
and
you
never
want
to
speak
to
me
again
she
rooted
up
a
fern
and
tore
it
into
little
ribbons
why
have
you
told
me
all
this
he
said
slowly
i
do
know
said
she
it
is
because
you
care
a
little
bit
about
about
my
thinking
well
of
you
i
ca
care
about
that
or
i
should
have
told
you
should
i
let
get
back
home
the
pony
lost
by
this
time
i
expect
is
it
because
you
do
want
to
have
any
any
secrets
between
us
not
in
the
least
said
betty
chin
in
the
air
i
should
of
telling
you
my
secrets
or
anyone
else
of
course
i
mean
she
added
politely
he
sighed
well
he
said
i
wish
you
go
home
why
do
you
say
you
disappointed
in
me
and
that
you
despise
me
and
that
you
do
care
about
being
friends
any
more
with
a
girl
who
told
lies
and
taken
her
aunt
money
and
done
everything
wrong
you
can
think
of
let
go
back
i
do
want
to
stay
here
any
more
with
you
being
silently
contemptuous
as
hard
as
ever
you
can
why
do
you
say
something
i
do
want
to
say
the
only
thing
i
want
to
say
i
do
want
to
say
it
here
wo
you
go
home
and
let
me
come
and
tell
you
at
long
barton
you
do
think
me
horrid
why
do
you
say
so
no
i
do
then
it
because
you
do
care
what
i
am
or
what
i
do
i
thought
a
man
friendship
did
mean
much
she
crushed
the
fern
into
a
rough
ball
and
threw
it
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
oh
hang
it
all
said
temple
look
here
miss
desmond
i
came
away
from
paris
because
i
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
know
who
it
was
i
really
cared
about
and
before
i
been
here
one
single
day
i
knew
and
then
i
met
you
and
i
have
said
a
word
because
you
here
alone
and
besides
i
wanted
you
to
get
used
to
talking
to
me
and
all
that
and
now
you
say
i
do
care
no
confound
it
all
it
too
much
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
and
i
have
waited
any
length
of
time
till
there
was
a
chance
for
me
he
had
almost
turned
his
back
on
her
and
leaning
his
chin
on
his
elbow
was
looking
out
over
the
far
below
and
now
you
gone
and
rushed
me
into
asking
you
when
i
know
there
is
the
least
chance
for
me
and
anyhow
i
ought
to
have
held
my
tongue
and
now
it
all
no
good
and
it
your
fault
why
did
you
say
i
did
care
you
knew
it
was
coming
betty
told
herself
when
he
asked
if
he
might
come
to
long
barton
to
see
you
you
knew
it
you
might
have
stopped
it
and
you
did
and
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
she
did
was
to
lean
back
to
reach
another
fern
to
pluck
and
smooth
its
fronds
are
you
very
angry
asked
temple
forlornly
no
said
betty
how
could
i
be
but
i
wish
you
had
it
spoiled
everything
do
you
think
i
do
know
all
that
i
wish
i
could
said
betty
very
sincerely
but
of
course
he
said
bitterly
i
knew
that
he
does
care
about
me
said
betty
he
engaged
to
someone
else
and
you
care
very
much
he
kept
his
face
turned
away
i
do
know
said
betty
sometimes
i
think
i
getting
not
to
care
at
all
then
look
here
may
i
ask
you
again
some
time
and
we
go
on
just
like
we
have
been
no
said
betty
i
going
back
to
england
at
the
end
of
the
week
besides
you
are
quite
sure
it
me
you
care
at
least
you
were
when
you
came
away
from
paris
how
can
you
be
sure
you
sure
now
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
instantly
i
think
i
did
understand
let
go
back
now
shall
we
for
heaven
sake
he
said
do
let
this
break
up
everything
do
avoid
me
in
the
little
time
that
left
i
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
i
wo
worry
you
do
be
silly
she
said
and
she
smiled
at
him
a
little
sadly
you
talk
as
though
i
did
know
you
chapter
xxvi
the
miracle
it
seemed
quite
dark
down
in
the
forest
or
rather
it
seemed
after
the
full
good
light
that
lay
upon
the
summit
of
the
rocks
like
the
gray
under
the
eyelids
of
one
who
dozes
in
face
of
a
dying
fire
do
let
go
straight
back
to
grez
said
betty
when
the
pony
was
harnessed
let
go
on
to
fontainebleau
and
have
dinner
and
drive
back
by
moonlight
do
you
think
it
would
be
fun
we
never
done
that
thank
you
he
said
you
good
his
eyes
met
hers
in
the
green
shadow
and
she
was
satisfied
because
he
had
understood
that
this
was
her
reply
to
his
appeal
to
her
not
to
avoid
him
in
the
little
time
there
was
left
both
were
gay
as
they
drove
along
the
golden
roads
gayer
than
ever
they
had
been
the
nearness
of
a
volcano
has
never
been
a
bar
to
gaiety
dinner
was
a
joyous
feast
and
when
it
was
over
and
the
other
guests
had
strolled
out
temple
sang
all
the
songs
betty
liked
best
betty
played
for
him
it
was
all
very
pleasant
and
both
pretended
quite
beautifully
that
they
were
the
best
of
friends
and
that
it
had
never
never
been
a
question
of
anything
else
the
pretence
lasted
through
all
the
moonlight
of
the
home
drive
lasted
indeed
till
the
pony
was
trotting
along
the
straight
avenue
that
leads
down
into
grez
and
even
then
it
was
not
temple
who
broke
it
it
was
betty
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
look
here
she
said
i
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
you
said
it
and
i
not
going
to
let
it
spoil
anything
only
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
do
understand
and
i
most
awfully
proud
that
you
should
i
am
really
and
i
rather
be
liked
by
you
than
by
anyone
almost
said
temple
a
little
bitterly
i
do
feel
sure
about
that
part
of
it
really
one
feels
and
thinks
such
a
lot
of
different
things
and
they
all
contradict
everything
else
till
one
does
know
what
anything
means
or
what
it
is
one
really
i
ca
explain
but
i
do
want
you
to
think
your
having
talked
about
it
makes
any
difference
at
least
i
do
mean
that
at
all
what
i
mean
is
that
of
course
i
like
you
ever
so
much
better
now
i
know
that
you
like
me
and
oh
i
do
want
to
i
do
want
you
to
think
it
all
no
good
because
really
and
truly
i
do
know
all
this
time
she
had
kept
her
hand
on
his
wrist
now
he
laid
his
other
hand
over
it
dear
he
said
that
all
i
want
and
more
than
i
hoped
for
now
i
wo
say
another
word
about
it
ever
if
you
rather
not
only
if
ever
you
feel
that
it
is
me
and
not
that
other
chap
then
you
tell
me
wo
you
i
tell
you
now
said
betty
that
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
you
and
not
the
other
when
he
had
said
goodnight
at
the
deserted
door
of
the
courtyard
betty
slipped
through
the
trees
to
her
pavilion
the
garden
seemed
more
crowded
with
trees
than
it
had
ever
been
it
was
almost
as
though
new
trees
from
the
forest
had
stolen
in
while
she
was
at
fontainebleau
and
joined
the
ranks
of
those
that
stood
sentinel
round
the
pavilion
there
was
a
lamp
in
the
garden
room
as
usual
its
light
poured
out
and
lay
like
a
yellow
carpet
on
the
terrace
and
lent
to
the
foliage
beyond
that
indescribable
air
of
festivity
of
that
green
leaves
can
always
borrow
from
artificial
light
i
just
see
if
there
are
any
letters
she
told
herself
there
always
might
be
from
aunt
julia
or
miss
voscoe
or
someone
she
went
along
the
little
passage
that
led
to
the
stairs
the
door
that
opened
from
it
into
the
garden
room
was
narrowly
ajar
a
slice
of
light
through
the
chink
stood
across
the
passage
there
was
someone
in
the
room
someone
was
speaking
she
knew
the
voice
she
must
be
in
soon
it
said
it
was
her
aunt
julia
voice
she
stopped
dead
and
there
was
silence
in
the
room
oh
to
be
caught
like
this
in
a
trap
and
just
when
she
had
decided
to
go
home
she
would
not
be
caught
she
would
steal
up
to
her
room
get
her
money
leave
enough
on
the
table
to
pay
her
bill
and
she
could
walk
to
marlotte
and
go
off
by
train
in
the
morning
to
brittany
anywhere
she
would
not
be
dragged
back
like
a
prisoner
to
be
all
the
rest
of
her
life
with
a
hateful
old
man
who
detested
her
aunt
julia
thought
she
was
very
clever
well
she
would
just
find
out
that
she
was
who
was
she
talking
to
not
madame
for
she
spoke
in
english
to
some
one
from
paris
who
could
have
betrayed
her
only
one
person
knew
lady
craye
well
lady
craye
should
not
betray
her
for
nothing
she
would
not
go
to
brittany
she
would
go
back
to
paris
that
woman
should
be
taught
what
it
costs
to
play
the
traitor
all
this
in
the
quite
small
pause
before
her
aunt
voice
spoke
again
unless
she
got
wind
of
our
coming
and
flown
it
said
our
coming
who
was
the
other
betty
was
eavesdropping
then
how
dishonourable
well
it
is
and
she
was
i
hope
to
heaven
she
safe
said
another
voice
oh
it
was
her
he
had
come
then
he
must
know
everything
she
moved
quite
without
meaning
to
move
her
knee
touched
the
door
and
it
creaked
very
very
faintly
but
it
creaked
would
they
hear
had
they
heard
no
the
aunt
voice
again
the
whole
thing
inexplicable
to
me
i
do
understand
it
you
let
betty
go
to
paris
by
your
advice
by
my
advice
but
also
because
you
wanted
her
to
be
happy
yes
heaven
knows
i
wanted
her
to
be
happy
the
old
man
voice
was
sadder
than
betty
had
ever
heard
it
so
we
found
madame
gautier
for
her
and
when
madame
gautier
dies
she
does
write
to
you
or
wire
to
you
to
come
and
find
her
a
new
chaperone
why
i
ca
imagine
why
do
you
think
it
may
have
been
because
she
was
afraid
of
you
thought
you
simply
make
her
come
back
to
long
barton
it
would
surely
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
imagine
that
i
should
lessen
the
time
which
i
had
promised
her
on
account
of
an
unfortunate
accident
she
knows
the
depth
of
my
affection
for
her
no
no
depend
upon
it
there
must
have
been
some
other
reason
for
the
deceit
i
almost
fear
to
conjecture
what
the
reason
may
have
been
do
you
think
it
possible
that
she
has
been
seeing
that
man
again
there
was
a
sound
as
of
a
chair
impatiently
pushed
back
betty
fled
noiselessly
to
the
stairs
no
footstep
followed
the
movement
of
the
chair
she
crept
when
you
do
see
her
her
aunt
was
asking
i
suppose
you
mean
to
heap
reproaches
on
her
and
take
her
home
in
disgrace
i
hope
i
shall
have
strength
given
me
to
do
my
duty
said
the
reverend
cecil
have
you
considered
what
your
duty
is
it
must
be
my
duty
to
reprove
to
show
her
her
deceit
in
its
full
enormity
you
enjoy
that
wo
you
it
gratify
your
sense
of
power
you
stand
in
the
place
of
god
to
the
child
and
you
be
glad
to
see
her
humbled
and
ashamed
because
a
thing
is
painful
to
me
it
is
none
the
less
my
duty
nor
any
the
more
snapped
miss
desmond
nor
any
the
more
what
you
wo
see
she
knows
you
do
care
about
her
and
that
why
she
kept
away
from
you
as
long
as
she
could
she
ca
know
it
it
is
true
she
thinks
it
is
do
think
so
do
imagine
i
do
care
for
her
have
you
been
poisoning
her
mind
and
oh
do
let
talk
about
poison
said
miss
desmond

i
should
not
care
to
be
saved
i
am

that
the
thought

sinful
but
i
fear
that
it
is
so
of
course

miss
desmond

not
your
child

should
you

little
she

only
living
thing

do
care
for
or

oh
it
is
like
a
woman
to
cast
it
up
at
me
as
a
reproach
that
i
have
no
child
why
have
i
no
child
because
the
woman
whom
almighty
god
made
for
my
child
mother
was
taken
from
me
in
her
youth
before
she
was
mine

lizzie

little
lizzie

heart
will
be
torn

it
is
my
duty
i
will
not

the
rod
and
she
will
understand
as
you
never
could
oh
my
little
lizzie
oh

god
she
is
safe
if
it
please
god
to
restore
her
safely
to
me
i
will
not
yield
to
the
wicked
promptings
of
my
own
selfish
affection
i
will
show
her
her
sin
and
we
will
pray
for
forgiveness
together
yes
i
will
not
shrink
even
if
it
break
my
heart
i
will
tell
her
i
should
tell
her
said
miss
desmond
just
what
you
told
me
the
old
man
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
betty
could
hear
every
movement
it
been
the
struggle
of
my
life
not
to
spoil
her
not
to
let
my
love
for
her
lead
me
to
neglect
her
eternal
welfare
not
to
lessen
her
modesty
by
my
praises
not
to
condone
the
sin
because
of
my
love
for
the
sinner
my
love
has
not
been
it
has
been
the
struggle
of
my
life
not
to
let
my
affection
be
a
snare
to
her
then
i
must
say
said
miss
desmond
that
you
might
have
been
better
employed
thank
god
i
have
done
my
duty
you
do
understand
but
my
lizzie
will
understand
yes
she
will
understand
cried
betty
bursting
open
the
door
and
standing
between
the
two
with
cheeks
that
flamed
i
do
understand
father
dear
auntie
i
do
understand
you
cruel
and
not
like
you
will
you
mind
going
away
please
the
cruel
aunt
smiled
and
moved
towards
the
door
as
she
passed
betty
she
whispered
i
thought
you
were
going
to
come
from
behind
that
door
i
could
have
kept
it
up
much
longer
then
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
firmly
betty
went
straight
to
her
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
you
do
forgive
me
you
will
forgive
me
wo
you
she
said
breathlessly
he
put
an
arm
awkwardly
round
her
there
nothing
you
could
do
that
i
could
forgive
he
said
in
a
choked
voice
but
it
is
my
duty
not
to
she
interrupted
him
by
drawing
back
to
look
at
him
but
she
kept
his
arm
where
it
was
by
her
hand
on
his
father
she
said
i
heard
everything
you
been
saying
it
no
use
scolding
me
because
you
ca
possibly
say
anything
that
i
have
said
to
myself
a
thousand
times
sit
down
and
let
me
tell
you
everything
every
single
thing
i
mean
to
come
home
this
week
and
tell
you
i
truly
did
i
wish
i
gone
home
before
oh
lizzie
said
the
old
man
how
could
you
how
could
you
i
did
understand
i
did
know
i
was
a
blind
idiot
oh
father
you
see
how
different
i
be
now
oh
if
one
of
us
had
died
and
i
never
known
known
what
my
child
oh
thank
god
i
have
you
safe
known
what
why
that
you
how
fond
you
are
of
me
you
did
know
i
i
was
always
sure
betty
hastened
to
say
a
miracle
had
happened
she
could
read
now
in
his
eyes
the
appeal
that
she
had
always
misread
before
but
now
i
shall
always
be
sure
always
and
i
going
to
be
such
a
good
daughter
to
you
you
see
if
only
forgive
me
and
you
will
forgive
me
oh
you
do
know
how
i
trust
you
now
did
you
always
not
enough
not
nearly
enough
but
i
do
now
let
me
tell
you
let
me
ever
be
afraid
of
you
oh
do
let
me
she
had
pushed
him
gently
into
a
chair
and
was
half
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
him
have
you
ever
been
afraid
of
me
oh
i
do
know
a
little
perhaps
sometimes
you
do
know
how
silly
i
am
but
not
now
you
glad
to
see
me
lizzie
he
said
god
knows
how
glad
i
am
but
it
my
duty
to
ask
you
at
once
whether
you
done
anything
wrong
everything
wrong
you
can
think
of
she
answered
enthusiastically
only
nothing
really
wicked
of
course
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
oh
do
remember
you
ca
think
worse
of
me
than
i
do
oh
glorious
not
to
be
afraid
of
me
his
tone
pleaded
again
no
no
of
anything
of
being
found
out
i
glad
you
come
for
me
i
glad
i
got
to
tell
you
everything
i
did
mean
to
go
home
next
week
but
i
glad
it
like
this
because
now
i
know
how
much
you
care
and
i
might
never
have
found
that
out
if
i
had
listened
at
the
door
like
a
mean
disgraceful
cat
i
ought
to
be
miserable
because
i
done
wrong
but
i
not
i
ca
be
i
really
most
frightfully
happy
thank
god
you
can
say
that
he
said
timidly
stroking
her
hair
with
the
hand
that
she
was
not
holding
now
i
not
afraid
of
anything
you
may
have
to
tell
me
my
child
my
dear
child
to
four
persons
the
next
day
was
one
of
the
oddest
in
their
lives
arriving
early
to
take
betty
to
finish
her
sketch
the
stricken
temple
was
greeted
on
the
doorstep
by
a
manly
looking
lady
in
spectacles
short
skirts
serviceable
brown
boots
and
a
mushroom
hat
i
know
who
you
are
said
she
you
temple
i
betty
aunt
would
you
like
to
take
me
on
the
river
betty
is
busy
this
morning
making
the
acquaintance
of
her
she
taken
him
out
in
the
little
cart
i
see
said
temple
i
shall
be
delighted
to
take
you
on
the
river
nice
young
man
you
do
ask
questions
an
excellent
trait
an
acquired
characteristic
i
assure
you
said
temple
remembering
his
first
meeting
with
betty
then
you
wo
be
able
to
transmit
it
to
your
children
that
a
pity
however
since
you
do
ask
i
tell
you
the
old
man
has
concealed
his
real
nature
from
betty
you
think
it
was
impossible
living
in
the
same
house
all
these
years
last
night
she
found
him
out
she
as
charmed
with
the
discovery
as
a
girl
child
with
a
doll
that
opens
and
shuts
its
eyes
or
a
young
man
with
the
nonentity
he
calls
his
ideal
come
along
she
spend
the
morning
playing
with
her
new
toy
cheer
up
you
shall
see
her
at
do
not
need
cheering
said
the
young
man
and
i
do
want
you
to
tell
me
things
you
rather
not
on
the
contrary
you
want
me
not
to
tell
you
the
things
i
rather
tell
you
no
i
should
like
to
tell
you
all
about
all
about
yourself
my
dear
young
man
there
is
nothing
i
enjoy
more
the
passion
for
confidences
is
my
only
vice
it
was
really
to
indulge
that
that
i
asked
you
to
come
on
the
river
with
me
i
thought
said
temple
as
they
reached
the
landing
stage
that
perhaps
you
had
asked
me
to
console
me
for
not
seeing
your
niece
this
morning
thank
you
kindly
miss
desmond
stepped
lightly
into
the
boat
i
rather
like
compliments
especially
when
you
solidly
built
like
myself
oh
yes
i
steer
pull
hard
bow
she
got
no
way
on
her
yet
and
the
stream
strong
just
here
under
the
bridge
i
gather
that
you
been
proposing
to
my
niece
i
did
mean
to
said
temple
pulling
a
racing
stroke
in
his
agitation
gently
gently
the
diamond
sculls
are
at
stake
she
led
you
on
you
mean
he
rested
on
his
oars
a
moment
and
laughed
what
is
there
about
you
that
makes
me
feel
that
i
known
you
all
my
life
possibly
it
my
enormous
age
or
it
may
be
that
i
nursed
you
when
you
were
a
baby
i
have
nursed
one
or
two
in
my
time
though
i
may
look
so
betty
entrapped
you
into
a
proposal
are
you
trying
to
make
me
angry
it
a
dangerous
river
can
you
swim
like
any
porpoise
but
of
course
i
misunderstand
people
if
they
explain
themselves
you
need
tremble
like
that
i
be
gentle
with
you
if
i
tremble
it
with
pleasure
said
temple
come
moderate
your
transports
and
unfold
your
tale
my
ears
are
red
i
know
but
they
are
small
and
sympathetic
well
then
said
temple
and
the
tale
began
by
the
time
it
was
ended
the
boat
was
at
a
standstill
on
the
little
backwater
below
the
pretties
of
the
sluices
there
was
a
silence
well
said
temple
well
said
miss
desmond
dipping
her
hand
in
the
water
what
a
stream
this
is
to
be
sure
well
your
means
are
satisfactory
and
you
seem
to
me
to
have
behaved
quite
beautifully
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
of
such
profoundly
correct
conduct
if
i
made
myself
out
a
prig
said
temple
i
sorry
i
could
tell
you
lots
of
things
please
spare
me
why
are
people
always
so
frightfully
ashamed
of
having
behaved
like
decent
human
beings
i
esteem
you
immensely
i
rather
you
liked
me
well
so
i
do
but
i
like
lots
of
people
i
do
esteem
if
i
married
anyone
it
would
probably
have
been
some
one
like
that
but
for
betty
it
different
i
should
have
needed
to
esteem
my
own
husband
but
i
must
esteem
hers
i
try
not
to
deserve
your
esteem
more
than
i
obliged
said
temple
but
your
liking
what
can
i
do
to
deserve
that
go
on
as
you
begun
my
dear
young
man
and
you
be
aunt
favourite
nephew
no
do
blush
it
an
acknowledgement
of
a
tender
speech
that
i
always
dispense
with
advise
me
said
he
red
to
the
ears
and
hands
she
does
care
for
me
at
present
what
can
i
do
what
most
of
us
have
to
do
when
we
want
anything
worth
wanting
wait
we
going
home
the
day
after
if
you
turn
up
at
long
barton
about
the
middle
of
september
you
might
come
down
for
the
harvest
festival
it
the
yearly
excitement
that
what
i
should
do
must
i
wait
so
long
as
that
he
asked
why
let
me
whisper
in
your
ear
said
miss
desmond
loud
above
the
chatter
of
the
weir
long
barton
is
very
dull
now
let
go
back
i
do
want
her
to
accept
me
because
she
bored
no
more
do
i
but
one
sees
the
proportions
of
things
better
when
dull
and
yes
i
esteem
you
i
like
you
you
are
ingenuous
and
no
really
that
was
a
yielding
to
the
devil
of
alliteration
i
mean
you
are
a
real
good
sort
the
other
man
has
the
harmlessness
of
the
serpent
as
for
me
i
have
the
wisdom
of
the
dove
you
profit
by
it
and
come
to
long
barton
in
september
it
seems
like
a
plot
to
catch
her
said
temple
a
friend
of
yours
told
me
you
were
straight
and
you
are
i
thought
perhaps
she
flattered
you
who
no
i
not
to
ask
questions
lady
st
craye
do
you
know
he
said
slowly
pulling
downstream
there
one
thing
i
did
tell
you
i
came
away
from
paris
because
i
was
quite
sure
that
i
was
in
love
with
not
you
said
miss
desmond
she
never
have
suited
you
and
now
she
throw
herself
away
on
the
man
with
the
green
eyes
and
the
past
i
mean
pasts
and
it
a
pity
she
a
woman
after
my
own
heart
she
extraordinarily
charming
said
temple
with
a
very
small
sigh
yes
extraordinarily
as
you
say
and
so
you
came
away
from
paris
i
begin
to
think
have
a
little
of
the
wisdom
of
the
dove
too
pull
now
or
we
shall
be
late
for
breakfast
he
pulled
now
said
the
reverend
cecil
that
evening
to
his
that
is
the
kind
of
youth
i
should
wish
to
see
my
lizzie
select
for
her
well
said
miss
desmond
if
you
keep
that
wish
strictly
to
yourself
i
should
think
it
had
a
better
chance
than
most
wishes
of
being
gratified
chapter
xxvii
the
pink
silk
story
to
call
on
the
concierge
at
betty
old
address
and
to
ask
for
news
of
her
had
come
to
seem
to
vernon
the
unbroken
habit
of
a
there
never
was
any
news
there
never
would
be
any
news
but
there
always
might
be
the
days
went
by
days
occupied
in
these
fruitless
enquiries
in
the
other
enquiries
after
the
health
of
lady
craye
and
in
watching
for
the
postman
who
should
bring
the
answer
to
his
formal
proposal
of
marriage
to
his
deep
surprise
and
increasing
disquietude
no
answer
came
was
the
reverend
cecil
dead
or
merely
inabordable
had
betty
despised
his
offer
too
deeply
to
answer
it
the
lore
learned
in
as
it
seemed
another
life
assured
him
that
a
woman
never
despises
an
offer
too
much
to
say
no
to
it
watch
for
the
postman
look
at
betty
portrait
call
on
the
concierge
he
had
been
used
to
dislike
the
employment
of
dirty
instruments
call
on
the
florist
there
was
a
decency
in
things
even
if
all
one
being
were
contemptibly
parched
for
the
sight
of
another
woman
call
and
enquire
for
the
poor
jasmine
lady
studio
think
of
betty
look
at
her
portrait
pretend
to
work
meals
at
fairly
correct
intervals
call
on
the
concierge
look
at
the
portrait
again
such
were
the
recurrent
incidents
of
vernon
life
between
the
incidents
came
a
padding
of
futile
endeavour
work
he
had
always
asserted
was
the
cure
for
inconvenient
emotions
only
now
the
cure
was
not
available
and
the
postman
brought
nothing
interesting
except
a
letter
denver
a
letter
of
tender
remonstrance
from
the
brittany
girl
miss
van
tromp
then
came
the
morning
when
the
concierge
demurely
assuring
him
of
her
devotion
to
his
interests
offered
to
post
a
letter
no
bribe
and
he
was
shameless
in
his
offers
could
wring
more
than
that
from
her
and
even
the
posting
of
the
letter
cost
a
sum
that
the
woman
chuckled
over
through
all
the
days
during
which
the
letter
lay
in
her
locked
drawer
under
lady
craye
bank
note
and
the
divers
tokens
of
interest
in
the
intrigue
whatever
the
intrigue
might
be
its
details
were
not
what
interested
vernon
went
home
pulled
the
table
into
the
middle
of
the
bare
studio
and
wrote
this
letter
wrote
itself
without
revision
why
did
you
go
away
it
said
where
are
you
where
can
i
see
you
what
has
happened
have
your
people
found
out
a
long
pause
the
end
of
the
pen
bitten
i
want
to
have
no
lies
or
deceit
any
more
between
us
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
never
been
engaged
to
anyone
but
you
would
not
let
me
see
you
without
that
so
i
let
you
think
it
will
you
forgive
me
can
you
for
lying
to

eustace
vernon
it
too
long
he
said
most
inartistic
but
i
wo
it
contemptible
ass
if
she
cares
it
wo
matter
if
she
does
it
matter
either
and
that
was
the
letter
that
lay
in
the
locked
drawer
for
a
week
and
through
that
week
the
watching
for
the
postman
went
on
went
on
and
the
enquiries
mechanically
and
no
answer
came
at
all
to
either
of
his
letters
had
the
concierge
deceived
him
had
she
really
no
address
to
which
to
send
the
letter
are
you
sure
that
you
posted
the
letter
altogether
monsieur
said
the
concierge
fingering
the
key
of
the
drawer
that
held
it
and
the
hot
ferment
of
paris
life
seethed
and
fretted
all
around
him
if
betty
were
at
long
barton
oh
the
dewy
gray
grass
in
the
warren
and
the
long
shadows
on
the
grass
three
days
more
went
by
you
have
posted
the
letter
but
yes
monsieur
be
tranquil
without
doubt
it
was
a
letter
that
should
exact
time
for
the
response
it
was
on
the
fifth
day
that
he
met
mimi
chantal
the
prettiest
model
on
the
left
bank
is
monsieur
by
chance
painting
the
great
picture
which
shall
put
him
between
velasquez
and
caran
on
the
last
day
i
am
painting
nothing
said
vernon
and
why
is
the
prettiest
model
in
paris
not
at
work
i
was
in
lateness
but
a
little
quarter
of
an
hour
monsieur
and
behold
me
chucked
it
was
for
the
first
time
then
a
nothing
one
or
two
days
last
week
monsieur
had
better
begin
to
paint
that
even
it
is
often
that
the
prettiest
model
in
paris
is
free
to
sit
at
a
moment
notice
but
said
vernon
i
have
an
idea
for
a
picture
even
it
is
too
hot
for
ideas
i
going
into
the
country
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
do
landscape
to
paint
a
picture
it
is
then
absolutely
necessary
to
have
an
idea
an
idea
or
a
commission
there
is
always
something
that
lacks
with
me
it
is
the
technique
that
is
to
seek
with
you
the
ideas
otherwise
we
should
both
be
masters
for
you
have
technique
both
hands
full
i
have
ideas
me
tell
me
some
of
them
said
vernon
strolling
along
by
her
side
it
was
not
his
habit
to
stroll
along
beside
models
but
he
was
fretted
and
chafed
by
long
waiting
for
that
answer
to
his
letter
anything
seemed
better
than
the
empty
studio
where
one
waited
here
is
one
i
have
the
idea
that
artists
have
no
eyes
how
they
pose
me
ever
as
or
la
source
or
leda
or
that
clumsy
suzanne
with
her
eternal
old
men
as
if
they
knew
better
than
i
do
how
a
woman
holds
herself
up
or
sits
herself
down
or
nurses
a
duck
or
defends
herself
your
idea
is
probably
correct
i
understand
you
to
propose
that
i
should
paint
a
picture
called
the
blind
artist
do
do
the
imbecile
i
propose
for
subject
me
not
posed
me
as
i
am
in
the
rest
is
it
not
that
it
is
then
that
i
am
the
most
pretty
the
most
chic
it
certainly
is
said
he
and
you
propose
that
i
should
paint
you
as
you
appear
in
the
rest
perfectly
she
interrupted
tender
rose
colour
it
goes
to
a
marvel
with
my
cléo
de
mérode
hair
and
if
you
want
a
contrast
or
one
of
those
little
tricks
to
make
people
say
does
it
mean
i
do
thank
you
he
laughed
paint
that
white
drowned
girl
face
that
hangs
behind
your
stove
paint
her
and
me
looking
at
each
other
she
has
the
air
of
felicitating
herself
that
she
is
dead
me
i
will
have
the
air
of
felicitating
myself
that
i
am
alive
you
will
see
monsieur
essay
but
one
sole
little
sketch
and
you
will
think
of
nothing
else
one
might
entitle
it
rivals
or
rest
said
vernon
a
little
interested
oh
well
i
not
doing
i
make
a
sketch
and
give
it
you
as
a
present
come
in
an
hour
auntie
wake
up
wake
up
betty
and
determined
was
pulling
back
the
curtain
with
fingers
that
rigidly
would
not
tremble
shut
the
door
and
spare
my
blushes
said
her
aunt
what
up
now
she
looked
at
the
watch
on
the
why

i
want

the
early
train

the
aunt
no
not
on
the
bed
i
hate
that
in
this
chair
now
remember
that
we
all
parted
last
night
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
that
as
far
as
i
know
nothing
has
happened
since
oh
no
nothing
of
course
said
betty
do
be
ironical
said
miss
desmond

the
morning
positively
immoral

sweet
story

i
get
temple
to

the
moment
you
came
in
come
child
sit
down
and
tell
me
not
unsympathetic
i
only
very
very
sleepy
and
i
think
everything
was
arranged
i
was
dreaming
of
orange
blossoms
and
the
voice
that
breathed
and
the
most
beautiful
trousseau
marked
and
silver
and
in
a
case
lined
with
purple
velvet
go
on
said
betty
if
it
amuses
you
no

i
sorry
forgive
the
ravings
of
delirium
go
on
poor
little
betty
do
worry
tell
its
own
aunt

not
a
joke
said
betty
so
i
more
and
more
perceive
now
that

the
aunt
sitting
up
and
throwing
back
her
thick
blond
hair
come

the
night

it
down
on
the
chest
of

and
they

of

of
them
from

a
week

said
miss
desmond
pouring
water
into
the
basin
well
and
he
wants
me
to
marry
him
and
he
was
never

and
it

a
lie
i

miss
desmond
through
splashings
my
friend

answer

his
letter

her
aunt
and
i
should
send
a
telegram
to
prepare
him

office
wo
be
open
there
a
train
at
seven
oh
do
hurry
i
ordered
the
pony
we
call
and
tell
mr
temple
it
was
not
the
that
was
caught
however
but
the
because
temple
was
naturally
in
bed
when
he
had
been
roused
and
had
dressed
and
come
out
to
them
in
the
gay
terrace
overhanging
the
river
where
the
little
tables
are
and
the
flowers
in
pots
and
the
trellis
miss
desmond
turned
and
positively
fled
before
the
gay
radiance
of
his
face
this
is
dear
and
sweet
of
you
he
said
to
betty
what
lovely
scheme
have
you
come
to
break
to
me
but
what
the
matter
you
not
ill
oh
do
said
betty
do
look
like
that
i
could
go
without
telling
you
it
all
over
bobbie
she
had
never
before
called
him
by
that
name
and
now
she
did
not
know
what
she
had
called
him
what
all
over
he
asked
mechanically
everything
she
said
your
thinking
i
was
going
to
perhaps
some
time
and
all
that
because
now
i
never
shall
o
bobbie
i
do
hate
hurting
you
and
i
do
like
you
so
frightfully
much
but
he
written
to
me

letter

delayed
and
it
all
a
mistake
and
i
going
to
him
now
oh
i
hope
you
be
able
to
forgive
me
it
not
your
fault
he
said
wait
a
minute
it
so
sudden
yes

see

you
worry
about
me
dearest
i
shall
be
all
right
may
i
know
who
it
is
it
vernon
said
betty
oh
my
god
temple
hand
clenched
no
no
no
no
i
am
so
very
very
sorry
said
betty
in
the
tone
one
uses
who
has
trodden
on
another
foot
in
an
omnibus
he
had
sat
down
at
one
of
the
little
tables
and
was
looking
out
over
the
shining
river
with
eyes
half
shut
but
it
not
true
he
said
it
ca
be
true
he
going
to
marry
lady
st
craye
that
all
a
mistake
said
betty
eagerly
he
only
said
that
because
i
have
time
to
tell
you
all
about
it
now
but
it
was
all
a
mistake
betty
dear
he
said
using
in
his
turn
for
the
first
time
her
christian
name
do
do
it
do
marry
him
you
do
know
i
thought
you
were
his
friend
so
i
am
said
temple
i
like
him
right
enough
but
what
all
the
friendship
in
the
world
compared
with
your
happiness
do
marry
him
dear
do
i
shall
marry
whom
i
choose
said
betty
chin
in
air
and
it
wo
be
you
i
do
care
if
i
am
vulgar
and
brutal
she
told
herself
it
serves
him
right
it
not
for
me
dear
it
not
for
me
it
for
you
i
go
right
away
and
never
see
you
again
marry
some
straight
chap
anyone
but
not
vernon
i
am
going
to
marry
vernon
said
betty
with
lofty
calm
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
any
annoyance
i
may
have
caused
you
of
course
i
see
now
that
i
could
never
i
mean
she
added
angrily
i
hate
people
who
are
false
to
their
friends
yes
and
now
i
missed
my
train
she
had
forgive
me
said
temple
when
the
fact
was
substantiated
and
the
gray
pony
put
up
after
all
i
was
your
friend
before
i
before
you
before
all
this
that
ca
come
to
anything
let
me
give
you
both
some
coffee
and
see
you
to
the
station
and
betty
do
you
go
and
be
sorry
about
me
afterwards
because
really
it
not
your
fault
and
he
laughed
and
was
silent
a
moment
and
i
rather
have
loved
you
and
have
it
end
like
this
dear
than
never
have
known
you
i
truly
would
the
journey
to
paris
was
interminable
betty
had
decided
not
to
think
of
temple
yet
that
happy
morning
face
of
his
would
come
between
her
and
the
things
she
wanted
to
think
of
to
have
hurt
him
like
that
it
hurt
her
horribly
much
more
than
she
would
have
believed
possible
and
she
had
been
cruel
of
course
it
natural
that
he
should
say
things
about
him
he
must
hate
anyone
that
he
nearly
cried
when
he
said
that
about
rather
have
loved
me
than
not
yes
a
lump
came
in
betty
own
throat
and
her
eyes
pricked
come
do
cry
said
her
aunt
briskly
you
made
your
choice
and
you
going
to
your
lover
do
be
like
lot
wife
you
ca
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
too
vernon
concierge
assured
these
ladies
that
monsieur
was
at
home
he
makes
the
painting
in
this
moment
she
said
mount
then
my
ladies
they
mounted
betty
remembered
her
last
her
first
visit
to
his
studio
when
paula
had
disappeared
and
she
had
gone
to
him
for
help
she
remembered
how
the
velvet
had
come
off
her
dress
and
how
awful
her
hair
had
been
when
she
had
looked
in
the
glass
afterwards
and
lady
craye
how
beautifully
dressed
how
smiling
and
superior
hateful
cat
said
betty
on
the
stairs
eh
said
her
aunt
now
there
would
be
no
one
in
the
studio
but
vernon
he
would
be
reading
over
her
letters
nothing
in
them
only
little
notes
about
whether
she
would
or
would
be
free
on
tuesday
whether
she
could
or
could
dine
with
him
on
wednesday
but
he
would
be
reading
them
over
perhaps
the
key
was
in
the
door
do
you
mind
waiting
on
the
stairs
auntie
dear
said
betty
in
a
voice
of
honey
just
the
first
minute
i
would
like
to
have
it
for
us
two
alone
you
do
mind
do
as
you
like
said
the
aunt
rather
sadly
i
should
knock
if
i
were
you
betty
did
not
knock
she
opened
the
studio
door
softly
she
would
like
to
see
him
before
he
saw
her
she
had
her
wish
a
big
canvas
stood
on
the
easel
a
stool
in
front
of
it
the
table
was
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
yellow
embroidered
cloth
on
it
there
was
food
on
the
cloth
little
breads
pretty
cakes
and
strawberries
and
cherries
and
wine
in
tall
beautiful
glasses
vernon
sat
in
his
big
chair
betty
could
see
his
profile
he
sat
there
laughing
on
the
further
arm
of
the
chair
sat
laughing
also
a
very
pretty
young
woman
her
black
hair
was
piled
high
on
her
head
and
fastened
with
a
jewelled
pin
the
sunlight
played
in
the
jewels
she
wore
a
pink
silk
garment
she
held
cherries
in
her
hand
she
said
and
put
one
of
the
twin
cherries
in
her
mouth
then
she
leant
over
him
laughing
and
vernon
reached
his
head
forward
to
take
in
his
mouth
the
second
cherry
that
dangled
below
her
chin
his
mouth
was
on
the
cherry
and
his
eyes
in
the
black
eyes
of
the
girl
in
pink
betty
banged
the
door
come
away
she
said
to
miss
desmond
and
she
who
had
seen
too
the
pink
picture
came
away
holding
betty
arm
tight
i
wonder
she
said
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
i
wonder
he
did
come
after
us
to
to
try
to
explain
i
locked
the
door
said
betty
do
speak
to
me
please
they
were
in
the
train
before
either
broke
silence
betty
face
was
white
and
she
looked
old
thirty
almost
her
aunt
thought
illustration
on
the
further
arm
of
the
chair
sat
laughing
also
a
very
pretty
young
woman
it
was
miss
desmond
who
spoke
betty
she
said
i
know
how
you
feel
but
you
very
young
i
think
i
ought
to
say
that
that
girl
said
betty
i
mean
what
we
saw
does
necessarily
mean
that
he
does
love
you
perhaps
not
said
betty
fierce
as
a
white
flame
anyhow
it
means
that
i
do
love
him
miss
desmond
tact
worn
by
three
days
of
anxiety
and
agitation
broke
suddenly
and
she
said
what
she
regretted
for
some
months
oh
you
do
love
now
well
the
other
man
will
console
you
i
hate
you
said
betty
and
i
hate
him
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
a
man
again
as
long
as
i
live
chapter
xxviii
and
so
the
banging
of
his
door
the
locking
of
it
annoyed
vernon
yet
interested
him
but
little
one
acquaintances
have
such
queer
notions
of
humour
he
had
the
excuse
and
by
good
luck
the
rope
to
explore
his
celebrated
roofs
mimi
was
more
agitated
than
he
so
he
dismissed
her
for
the
day
with
many
compliments
and
a
bunch
of
roses
and
spent
what
was
left
of
the
light
in
painting
in
a
background
to
the
sketch
of
betty
the
warren
as
his
helped
him
to
remember
it
perhaps
he
and
she
would
go
there
together
some
day
he
looked
with
extreme
content
at
the
picture
on
the
easel
he
had
worked
quickly
and
well
the
thing
was
coming
splendidly
mimi
had
been
right
she
could
pose
herself
as
no
artist
had
ever
posed
her
he
would
make
a
picture
of
the
thing
after
all
the
next
morning
brought
him
a
letter
that
he
who
had
hated
letters
should
have
come
to
care
for
a
letter
more
than
for
anything
that
could
have
come
to
him
except
a
girl
he
kissed
the
letter
before
he
opened
it
at
last
he
said
oh
this
minute
was
worth
waiting
for
he
opened
the
envelope
with
a
smile
mingled
of
triumph
and
something
better
than
triumph
and
read
dear
vernon
i
hope
that
nothing
in
my
manner
has
led
you
to
expect
any
other
answer
than
the
one
i
must
give
that
answer
is
of
course
although
thanking
you
sincerely
for
your
flattering
offer
i
am
obliged
to
say
that
i
have
never
thought
of
you
except
as
a
friend
i
was
extremely
surprised
by
your
letter
i
hope
i
have
not
been
in
any
way
to
blame
with
every
wish
for
your
happiness
and
regrets
that
this
should
have
happened
i
am
yours
faithfully
elizabeth
desmond
he
read
the
letter
it
raised
his
eyebrows
then
he
took
two
turns
across
the
studio
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
lit
a
match
and
watched
the
letter
burn
as
the
last
yellow
moving
sparks
died
in
the
black
of
its
ash
he
bit
his
lip
damn
he
said
oh
damn
next
day
he
went
to
spain
a
bunch
of
roses
bigger
and
redder
than
any
roses
he
had
ever
sent
her
came
to
lady
craye
with
his
card
in
the
corner
she
too
shrugged
her
shoulders
bit
her
lip
and
arranged
the
roses
in
water
presently
she
tried
to
take
up
her
life
at
the
point
where
she
had
laid
it
down
when
last
october
vernon
had
taken
it
into
his
hands
succeeding
as
one
does
succeed
in
such
enterprises
it
was
may
again
when
vernon
found
himself
once
more
sitting
at
one
of
the
little
tables
in
front
of
the
café
de
la
paix
sit
here
long
enough
he
said
and
you
see
every
one
you
have
ever
known
or
ever
wanted
to
know
last
year
it
was
the
jasmine
lady
and
that
girl
on
the
same
one
and
wonderful
day
this
year
it
by
jove
he
rose
and
moved
among
the
closely
set
chairs
and
tables
to
the
pavement
the
sightless
stare
of
spectacles
met
his
eyes
a
lady
in
short
skirts
stood
awaiting
him
how
are
you
she
said
yes
i
know
you
did
see
me
but
i
thought
you
like
to
i
do
like
to
indeed
may
i
walk
with
you
or
he
glanced
back
at
the
table
where
his
vermouth
stood
untasted
the
impertinence
of
it
frightfully
improper
to
sit
outside
cafés
is
it
for
women
i
mean
and
this
café
in
particular
yes
join
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
coffee
please
it
ages
since
i
saw
you
he
said
amiably
not
since
since
i
called
on
you
at
your
hotel
how
frightened
you
were
not
for
long
he
answered
looking
at
her
with
the
eyes
she
loved
the
eyes
of
someone
who
was
not
vernon
ah
me
a
lot
of
water
has
run
not
under
the
bridges
she
pleaded
say
off
the
umbrellas
since
he
pursued
we
had
that
good
talk
you
remember
i
wanted
to
call
on
you
in
london
and
you
would
let
me
you
might
let
me
now
i
will
she
said
curzon
street
your
eyes
have
changed
colour
a
bit
nor
your
nature
i
suppose
yet
something
about
you
changed
got
over
betty
yet
quite
thanks
he
said
tranquilly
but
last
time
we
met
you
remember
we
agreed
that
i
had
no
intentions
illustration
the
next
morning
brought
him
a
letter
wrong
lead
she
said
smiling
frankly
at
him
and
besides
i
hold
all
the
trumps
ace
king
queen
and
ace
knave
and
queen
of
another
suit
expound
i
implore
aces
equal
general
definite
and
decisive
information
king
and
queen
of
hearts
equal
betty
and
the
other
man
there
was
another
man
then
there
always
is
is
there
knave
your
honoured
self
queen
where
is
the
queen
by
the
way
the
beautiful
queen
with
the
sad
eyes
blind
poor
dear
quite
blind
to
everything
but
the
abominable
knave
meaning
me
it
not
an
unbecoming
cap
she
said
stirring
her
coffee
and
you
wear
it
with
an
air
where
the
queen
of
your
suit
i
confess
i
at
fault
the
odd
trick
is
mine
and
the
honours
you
may
as
well
throw
down
your
hand
yes
i
play
whist
not
bridge
where
is
your
queen
lady
what
is
it
i
have
seen
her
he
said
steadily
since
last
june
i
left
paris
on
a
sudden
impulse
and
i
had
time
to
say
to
her
did
you
even
leave
a
card
that
not
like
your
eyes
i
think
i
sent
a
tub
of
hydrangeas
or
something
dire
that
was
definite
remember
the
date
no
he
said
remembering
perfectly
not
the
eleventh
was
it
that
was
the
day
when
you
would
get
letter
of
rejection
it
may
have
been
the
in
fact
it
ah
that
better
and
the
tenth
who
let
you
out
of
your
studio
on
the
tenth
i
often
wondered
i
often
wondered
who
locked
me
in
it
could
have
been
you
of
course
as
you
say
but
i
was
there
it
was
but
it
was
i
thought
you
guess
that
she
got
your
letter
and
came
up
ready
to
fall
into
your
arms
opened
the
door
softly
like
any
heroine
of
fiction
i
told
her
to
knock
but
no
beheld
the
pink
silk
picture
and
fled
the
happy
shore
forever
damn
he
said
i
do
beg
your
pardon
but
really
do
waste
those
really
convincing
damns
on
ancient
history
i
told
her
it
did
mean
that
you
did
love
her
that
was
of
you
it
was
also
quite
futile
she
said
it
means
did
love
at
any
rate
i
suppose
she
wrote
and
told
you
so
a
long
pause
then
as
you
say
said
vernon
it
ancient
history
but
you
said
something
about
another
man
oh
yes
your
friend
say
again
if
it
the
slightest
comfort
to
you
i
heard
worse
words
when
asked
vernon
and
he
sipped
his
vermouth
not
straight
away
bless
me
no
months
and
months
that
picture
in
your
studio
gave
her
the
distaste
for
all
men
for
quite
a
long
time
we
took
her
home
her
father
and
me
by
the
way
he
and
she
are
tremendous
chums
now
well
you
do
want
me
to
tell
you
the
sweet
secret
tale
of
their
betrothal
he
just
came
down
at
christmas
it
was
she
was
decorating
the
church
her
father
had
a
transient
gleam
of
common
sense
and
sent
him
down
to
her
it
you
it
you
all
was
over
they
returned
to
that
rectory
an
engaged
couple
they
were
made
for
each
same
tastes
same
sentiments
they
love
the
same
things
gardens
scenery
the
simple
life
lofty
ideals
cathedrals
and
walt
whitman
and
when
are
they
to
be
married
they
are
married
are
we
waiting
for
you
and
i
no
i
know
which
of
them
said
it
they
were
married
at
easter
children
throwing
cowslips
quite
idyllic
all
the
old
ladies
from
the
mother
mutual
twaddle
club
came
and
shed
fat
tears
they
presented
a
maroon
with
blue
roses
most
class
and
select
easter
said
vernon
refusing
interest
to
the
maroon
and
blue
she
must
indeed
have
been
extravagantly
fond
of
me
not
she
she
wanted
to
be
in
love
we
all
do
you
know
and
you
were
the
first
but
she
never
have
suited
you
i
never
known
but
two
women
who
would
two
he
said
which
myself
for
one
saving
your
presence
she
laughed
and
finished
her
coffee
if
i
happened
to
meet
you
when
i
was
young
and
not
it
only
my
age
that
keeps
you
from
falling
in
love
with
me
the
other
one
the
queen
of
your
suit
poor
lady
that
you
sent
the
haystack
of
sunflowers
to
well
come
and
see
me
when
in
town
curzon
street
do
forget
i
sha
forget
he
said
and
if
i
thought
you
would
condescend
to
look
at
me
it
is
what
you
call
your
age
that
would
keep
me
from
falling
in
love
with
you
heaven
defend
me
she
cried
when
vernon
had
finished
his
vermouth
he
strolled
along
to
the
street
where
last
year
lady
craye
had
had
a
flat
yes
madame
retained
still
the
apartment
it
was
that
madame
received
but
the
last
of
the
friends
of
madame
had
departed
monsieur
would
find
madame
alone
monsieur
found
madame
alone
and
reading
she
laid
the
book
face
downwards
on
the
table
and
held
out
the
hand
he
had
always
loved
slender
and
loosely
made
that
one
felt
one
could
so
easily
crush
in
one
own
how
time
flies
she
said
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
you
were
here
how
sweet
you
were
to
me
when
i
had
influenza
how
are
you
you
look
very
tired
i
am
tired
he
said
i
have
been
in
spain
and
in
italy
and
in
algiers
very
fatiguing
countries
i
understand
and
what
is
your
best
news
he
stood
on
the
looking
down
at
her
betty
desmond
married
he
said
yes
she
answered
to
that
nice
boy
temple
too
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
dreadful
is
it
here
and
gone
i
tell
you
why
she
married
him
said
vernon
letting
himself
down
into
a
chair
if
you
like
me
to
at
least
i
tell
you
why
she
did
marry
me
but
perhaps
the
subject
has
ceased
to
interest
you
not
at
all
she
answered
with
extreme
politeness
so
he
told
her
yes
i
suppose
it
would
be
like
that
it
must
have
annoyed
you
very
much
it
left
marks
on
your
face
eustace
you
look
tired
to
death
that
sort
of
thing
does
leave
marks
that
girl
taught
you
something
eustace
something
that
stuck
it
is
not
impossible
i
suppose
he
said
and
then
very
carelessly
as
one
leading
the
talk
to
lighter
things
he
added
i
suppose
you
would
care
to
marry
me
candidly
she
answered
calling
all
her
powers
of
deception
to
her
aid
candidly
i
do
think
i
should
i
knew
it
said
vernon
smiling
my
heart
told
me
so
she
said
lady
craye
was
frightened
away
from
her
happiness
as
they
call
it
by
seeing
you
rather
near
to
a
pink
silk
model
i
suppose
you
think
should
mind
such
things
you
forget
said
vernon
demurely
such
things
never
happen
after
one
is
married
no
she
said
of
course
they
do
i
forgot
that
you
might
as
well
marry
me
he
said
and
the
look
of
youth
had
come
back
suddenly
as
it
way
was
to
his
face
i
might
very
much
better
not
they
looked
at
each
other
steadily
she
saw
in
his
eyes
a
little
of
what
it
was
that
betty
had
taught
him
she
never
knew
what
he
saw
in
hers
for
all
in
a
moment
he
was
kneeling
beside
her
his
arm
was
across
the
back
of
her
chair
his
head
was
on
her
shoulder
and
his
face
was
laid
against
her
neck
as
the
face
of
a
child
tired
with
a
long
is
laid
against
the
neck
of
its
mother
ah
be
nice
to
me
he
said
i
am
very
tired
her
arm
went
round
his
shoulders
as
the
mother
arm
goes
round
the
shoulders
of
the
child
the
end
