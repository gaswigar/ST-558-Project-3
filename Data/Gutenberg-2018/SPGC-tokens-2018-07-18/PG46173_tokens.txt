peter
tourmalin
was
sitting
or
rather
lying
in
a
on
the
of
the
and
steamer
which
had
not
been
many
days
as
yet
on
the
voyage
home
from
sydney
he
had
been
trying
to
read
but
it
was
a
hot
morning
and
the
curry
of
which
he
had
partaken
freely
at
breakfast
had
made
him
feel
a
little
heavy
and
disinclined
for
mental
exertion
just
then
particularly
as
buckle
of
the
first
volume
of
which
he
had
brought
up
from
the
ship
library
is
not
exactly
light
literature
at
any
time
he
wanted
distraction
of
some
sort
but
he
could
not
summon
up
sufficient
energy
to
rise
and
pace
the
deck
as
his
only
acquaintance
on
board
a
perkins
was
doing
with
a
breezy
vigour
which
tourmalin
found
himself
feebly
resenting
another
alternative
was
open
to
him
it
is
true
not
far
away
were
other
in
which
some
of
the
lady
passengers
were
reading
writing
and
chatting
more
or
less
languidly
there
were
not
very
many
on
board
for
it
was
autumn
a
time
at
which
vessels
are
not
apt
to
be
crowded
but
even
in
that
small
group
there
were
one
or
two
with
whom
it
might
have
seemed
possible
to
pass
a
little
time
in
a
pleasant
and
profitable
manner
for
instance
there
was
that
tall
graceful
girl
in
the
skirt
and
the
striped
cotton
blouse
confined
at
her
slender
waist
by
a
leathern
belt
tourmalin
it
should
be
mentioned
was
in
the
habit
of
noticing
the
details
of
feminine
costume
she
had
regular
features
grey
eyes
which
lighted
up
whenever
she
spoke
and
an
expression
of
singular
nobility
and
sweetness
her
fair
hair
was
fastened
up
in
loose
gleaming
masses
under
her
highly
becoming
straw
hat
peter
watched
her
surreptitiously
from
time
to
time
from
behind
the
third
page
of
buckle
she
was
attempting
to
read
a
novel
but
her
attention
like
his
own
wandered
occasionally
and
he
even
fancied
that
he
surprised
her
now
and
then
in
the
act
of
glancing
at
himself
with
a
certain
interest
near
her
was
another
girl
not
quite
so
tall
and
darker
but
scarcely
less
pleasing
in
appearance
she
wore
a
pink
frock
and
her
luxuriant
bronze
tresses
were
set
off
by
a
simple
cap
she
held
some
embroidery
in
her
listless
fingers
but
was
principally
occupied
in
gazing
out
to
sea
with
a
wistful
and
almost
melancholy
expression
her
eyes
were
soft
and
brown
and
her
features
piquantly
irregular
giving
peter
who
considered
himself
no
mean
judge
of
female
character
the
impression
of
a
highly
emotional
and
enthusiastic
temperament
he
thought
he
saw
signs
that
she
also
honoured
him
by
her
notice
peter
was
a
little
man
with
weak
eyes
and
flaxen
hair
but
even
little
men
may
indulge
these
fancies
at
times
without
grossly
deceiving
themselves
he
knew
as
one
does
learn
such
things
on
board
ship
that
the
name
of
the
first
young
lady
was
tyrrell
and
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
judge
who
had
been
spending
the
long
vacation
in
a
voyage
to
recruit
his
health
of
the
other
he
knew
no
more
than
that
she
was
a
miss
davenport
at
present
however
he
had
no
personal
acquaintance
with
either
of
them
and
in
fact
as
has
already
been
said
knew
nobody
on
board
to
speak
to
except
the
energetic
perkins
a
cheery
man
with
a
large
fund
of
general
information
who
was
going
home
on
some
business
connected
with
a
banking
house
in
melbourne
and
yet
it
is
not
difficult
to
make
acquaintances
on
board
ship
if
a
man
cares
to
do
so
accident
or
design
will
provide
opportunities
in
plenty
and
two
or
three
days
at
sea
are
equivalent
to
at
least
as
many
weeks
on
shore
and
peter
being
quite
aware
of
these
facts
and
by
no
means
indifferent
to
the
society
of
the
other
sex
which
indeed
he
considered
more
interesting
than
that
of
his
own
it
would
seem
that
he
must
have
had
some
strong
reason
for
having
kept
studiously
apart
from
the
social
life
on
board
the
he
had
a
reason
and
it
was
this
he
was
an
engaged
man
and
on
his
probation
a
bachelor
still
under
thirty
of
desultory
habits
which
unfitted
him
to
shine
in
any
profession
he
had
a
competency
that
refuge
of
the
incompetent
which
made
him
independent
some
months
previously
he
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
a
lady
somewhat
his
junior
in
years
but
endowed
with
charms
of
mind
and
character
which
excited
his
admiration
and
reverence
he
recognised
that
she
supplied
the
qualities
in
which
he
felt
himself
deficient
he
was
weary
of
the
rather
purposeless
life
he
had
led
he
wanted
a
wife
who
would
regulate
and
organise
his
existence
and
miss
sophia
pinceney
with
her
decision
and
her
thoroughness
was
eminently
the
person
to
do
it
so
it
was
not
long
before
he
took
courage
and
proposed
to
her
miss
pinceney
though
she
had
been
highly
educated
and
possessed
a
considerable
fortune
of
her
own
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
look
unfavourably
upon
such
a
suitor
he
might
not
be
quite
her
intellectual
equal
but
he
was
anxious
to
improve
his
mind
he
was
amiable
and
amenable
and
altogether
likely
under
careful
guidance
to
prove
an
excellent
husband
but
she
was
prudent
and
reason
told
her
that
the
suddenness
of
peter
passion
was
no
guarantee
of
its
enduring
qualities
she
had
heard
and
seen
too
much
of
a
rather
catholic
susceptibility
in
his
nature
to
feel
it
safe
to
incur
so
grave
a
risk
as
marriage
until
she
had
certain
proof
that
his
attachment
to
her
was
robust
enough
to
bear
the
severest
test
and
to
that
test
she
was
determined
to
submit
him
she
consented
to
an
engagement
on
one
condition
that
he
was
to
take
a
long
voyage
if
he
returned
in
the
same
mind
she
would
be
sufficiently
sure
of
his
constancy
to
marry
him
as
soon
as
he
wished
if
he
did
not
her
misgivings
would
be
amply
justified
there
was
very
little
sentiment
about
sophia
she
took
a
practical
and
philosophical
view
of
the
marriage
union
as
became
a
disciple
of
ibsen
i
like
you
peter
she
told
him
frankly
you
have
many
qualities
that
endear
you
to
me
but
i
do
feel
that
i
can
depend
upon
you
at
present
and
from
what
i
know
of
you
i
fear
it
is
only
too
probable
that
absence
and
the
attractive
society
of
a
may
lead
you
to
discover
that
you
have
mistaken
the
depth
of
the
feeling
you
entertain
for
me
but
look
here
sophia
he
had
expostulated
if
you
afraid
of
that
why
do
you
make
me
go
because
she
had
replied
with
her
admirable
because
if
my
fears
should
prove
to
be
unhappily
only
too
i
shall
at
least
have
made
the
discovery
before
it
is
too
late
and
in
spite
of
all
his
protests
peter
had
to
go
sophia
sought
to
reconcile
him
to
this
necessity
by
pointing
out
the
advantages
of
travel
the
enlarging
effect
it
would
have
upon
his
mind
and
the
opportunities
a
long
afforded
for
regular
and
uninterrupted
study
on
the
lines
she
had
already
mapped
out
for
him
but
despite
these
consolations
he
went
away
in
low
spirits
when
the
moment
came
for
parting
even
the
sophia
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
compunction
something
tells
me
peter
she
said
that
the
ordeal
will
prove
too
much
for
you
in
spite
of
your
good
resolutions
you
will
sooner
or
later
be
drawn
into
some
flirtation
which
will
make
you
forget
me
i
know
you
so
well
peter
i
wish
you
could
show
a
little
more
confidence
in
me
he
had
answered
in
a
wounded
tone
since
i
met
you
sophia
i
have
ceased
to
be
the
butterfly
i
was
but
as
you
seem
to
doubt
me
it
may
relieve
your
mind
if
i
promise
faithfully
that
while
i
am
away
from
you
i
will
never
under
any
inducement
allow
myself
to
overstep
the
limits
of
the
most
ordinary
civility
towards
any
woman
with
whom
i
may
be
brought
in
contact
i
swear
it
sophia
are
you
satisfied
now
perhaps
he
had
a
secret
prevision
that
a
time
might
come
when
this
oath
would
prove
a
salutary
restraint
upon
his
straying
fancy
and
it
certainly
had
an
immediate
and
most
reassuring
effect
upon
sophia
tourmalin
had
gone
out
to
australia
had
seen
something
of
the
country
during
his
stay
in
the
colony
and
was
now
as
we
have
seen
on
his
return
and
during
the
whole
time
his
oath
to
his
great
credit
had
been
literally
and
faithfully
kept
during
the
voyage
out
he
had
been
too
persistently
unwell
to
be
inclined
to
dally
with
sentiment
but
in
his
subsequent
wanderings
he
had
avoided
or
rather
escaped
all
intercourse
with
any
colonial
ladies
who
might
by
any
possibility
affect
his
allegiance
to
sophia
whose
image
consequently
still
held
undisputed
possession
of
his
heart
in
case
he
should
feel
himself
wavering
at
any
time
he
had
been
careful
to
provide
himself
with
a
talisman
in
the
shape
of
a
photograph
the
mere
sight
of
which
would
be
instantly
effectual
but
somehow
since
he
had
been
on
board
the
the
occasions
on
which
he
had
been
driven
to
refer
to
this
photograph
had
been
growing
more
and
more
frequent
while
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
tormenting
consciousness
that
it
took
an
increasingly
longer
time
to
work
he
brought
it
out
now
and
studied
it
attentively
it
was
the
likeness
of
a
girl
without
any
great
pretensions
to
beauty
with
dark
hair
rolled
neatly
back
from
a
massive
brow
that
shone
with
intellectuality
penetrating
eyes
whose
keenness
was
generally
tempered
by
a
large
firm
mouth
and
a
square
chin
altogether
the
face
of
a
young
woman
who
would
stand
no
trifling
he
put
it
back
respectfully
in
his
pocket
but
the
impulse
to
go
across
and
drop
in
an
accidental
fashion
into
a
vacant
seat
near
one
of
those
two
girls
was
still
unconquered
he
was
feeling
so
dull
he
had
got
such
a
very
little
way
into
the
of
a
work
which
he
was
reading
rather
for
satisfaction
than
his
own
and
there
was
such
a
lot
more
of
it
might
he
not
allow
himself
a
brief
holiday
and
beguile
the
long
weary
morning
with
a
little
cheerful
conversation
it
was
most
unlikely
strict
etiquette
being
by
general
consent
suspended
on
board
ship
that
either
young
lady
would
resent
a
hazarded
remark
at
all
events
he
could
but
try
but
then
his
oath
his
rash
and
voluntary
oath
to
sophia
what
of
that
he
had
not
it
was
true
debarred
himself
from
ordinary
civility
but
could
he
be
sure
of
keeping
always
within
those
bounds
if
the
acquaintanceship
was
once
established
he
had
reasons
for
doubting
this
very
seriously
and
besides
had
not
sophia
more
than
hinted
in
her
last
letter
that
as
a
reward
for
his
fidelity
she
might
join
the
ship
at
gibraltar
with
her
mother
and
so
put
an
earlier
end
to
his
term
of
probation
he
could
not
be
too
careful
after
holding
out
so
long
it
would
be
madness
to
relax
his
precautions
now
no
he
would
resist
these
sirens
like
a
modern
ulysses
though
in
the
latter
case
the
sirens
were
not
actually
on
board
and
even
then
the
hero
had
to
be
lashed
to
the
mast
but
tourmalin
felt
confident
notwithstanding
that
he
would
prove
at
least
as
obdurate
as
the
wily
greek
he
was
not
a
man
but
he
had
one
quality
which
is
almost
as
valuable
a
safeguard
against
temptation
as
strength
of
mind
namely
timidity
his
love
for
his
betrothed
was
chastened
by
a
considerable
dash
of
awe
and
he
was
resolved
not
to
compromise
himself
in
her
eyes
just
for
the
sake
of
a
little
temporary
distraction
at
this
point
of
his
deliberations
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
close
upon
twelve
only
one
hour
to
be
got
through
before
tiffin
why
an
hour
was
nothing
he
could
surely
contrive
to
kill
it
over
buckle
a
little
courage
a
little
concentration
and
he
would
certainly
attain
to
an
interest
in
the
laws
which
govern
human
actions
the
ship
bells
were
just
striking
he
counted
the
strokes
one
two
three
four
five
and
no
more
there
must
be
some
mistake
it
could
not
possibly
be
only
ten
why
it
was
hours
since
breakfast
looking
at
your
watch
eh
said
his
friend
perkins
as
he
reached
peter
chair
for
about
the
hundredth
time
ah
you
fast
i
see
have
altered
your
watch
yet
they
put
the
ship
clock
back
again
this
morning
nearly
it
was
this
time
it
was
rather
less
yesterday
and
the
day
before
we
shall
go
on
gaining
so
much
extra
time
a
day
i
suppose
till
we
get
to
gib
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
exclaimed
peter
with
a
groan
if
the
time
had
seemed
tedious
and
interminable
enough
before
how
much
more
so
was
it
now
how
infinitely
greater
would
the
effort
be
to
fix
his
thoughts
resolutely
on
buckle
and
ignore
the
very
existence
of
his
distracting
neighbours
now
that
it
was
to
be
daily
prolonged
in
this
exasperating
manner
you
do
seem
to
appreciate
the
arrangement
remarked
the
manager
as
he
allowed
himself
to
drop
cautiously
for
he
was
a
bulky
man
into
a
beside
tourmalin
appreciate
it
said
peter
with
strong
disgust
are
there
enough
and
confoundedly
long
ones
too
in
the
day
as
it
is
without
having
extra
ones
forced
on
you
like
this
and
giving
it
to
us
in
the
daytime
too
they
might
at
least
put
the
clock
back
at
night
when
it
would
so
much
matter
i
do
think
it
very
bad
management
i
must
say
his
companion
began
a
long
explanation
about
the
meridian
and
sun
time
and
ship
time
and
greenwich
time
to
which
peter
gave
but
a
very
intermittent
attention
so
stupefied
did
he
feel
at
this
unwelcome
discovery
it
a
curious
thing
to
think
of
the
other
was
saying
thoughtfully
that
a
man
by
simply
making
a
voyage
like
this
should
make
a
clear
gain
of
several
hours
which
he
would
never
have
had
at
all
if
he
had
stayed
at
home
i
would
much
rather
be
without
them
said
peter
i
find
it
quite
difficult
enough
to
spend
the
time
as
it
is
and
how
on
earth
i
can
spend
any
more
i
do
know
why
spend
it
then
asked
his
friend
quietly
what
else
am
i
to
do
with
it
what
else
see
here
my
friend
when
you
have
an
amount
of
spare
cash
that
you
no
immediate
use
for
you
do
let
it
lie
idle
at
home
do
you
you
pay
it
in
to
your
credit
at
a
bank
and
let
it
remain
on
deposit
till
you
want
it
eh
well
then
why
not
treat
your
spare
time
as
you
would
your
spare
cash
do
you
see
what
i
mean
not
altogether
confessed
peter
considerably
puzzled
it
simple
enough
nowadays
for
instance
the
establishment
i
have
the
honour
to
be
connected
with
the
joint
stock
time
bank
limited
confines
itself
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
almost
entirely
to
that
class
of
business
ah
said
peter
no
more
enlightened
than
before
does
it
indeed
would
you
mind
explaining
what
particular
class
of
business
it
carries
on
i
do
quite
understand
bless
my
soul
sir
said
the
manager
rather
irritably
you
must
be
uncommonly
ignorant
of
financial
matters
not
to
have
heard
of
this
before
however
i
will
try
to
make
it
clear
to
you
i
daresay
you
have
heard
that
is
money
very
well
all
our
operations
are
conducted
on
that
principle
we
are
prepared
to
make
advances
on
good
security
of
course
of
time
to
almost
any
amount
and
we
are
simply
overwhelmed
with
applications
for
loans
business
men
as
you
may
know
are
perpetually
pressed
for
time
and
will
consent
to
almost
anything
to
obtain
it
our
transactions
in
time
sir
are
immense
why
the
amount
of
time
passing
through
our
books
annually
during
the
last
ten
years
averages
ah
about
sixty
centuries
that
pretty
well
i
think
sir
he
was
so
perfectly
and
serious
that
peter
almost
forgot
to
see
anything
preposterous
in
what
he
said
it
sounds
magnificent
he
said
politely
only
you
see
i
want
to
borrow
any
time
myself
i
too
much
on
my
hands
already
just
so
said
the
manager
but
if
you
will
kindly
hear
me
out
i
am
coming
to
that
lending
time
is
only
one
side
of
our
business
we
are
also
ready
to
accept
the
charge
of
any
spare
time
that
customers
may
be
willing
to
deposit
with
us
and
with
our
experience
and
facilities
i
need
hardly
say
that
we
are
able
to
employ
it
to
the
best
advantage
now
say
for
example
that
you
wish
to
open
an
account
with
us
well
we
take
these
spare
of
yours
that
are
only
an
encumbrance
to
you
at
present
and
if
you
choose
to
allow
them
to
remain
on
deposit
they
will
carry
interest
at
five
per
cent
per
month
that
is
five
minutes
on
every
hour
and
roughly
for
each
month
until
you
withdraw
them
in
that
way
alone
by
merely
leaving
your
time
with
us
for
six
months
you
will
gain
now
let
me
see
over
three
additional
hours
in
compound
interest
on
your
original
capital
of
ten
hours
or
so
and
no
previous
notice
required
before
withdrawal
let
me
tell
you
sir
you
will
not
find
many
banks
do
business
on
such
terms
as
that
no
said
peter
who
could
not
follow
all
this
arithmetic
so
i
should
imagine
only
i
do
quite
see
if
you
will
pardon
my
saying
so
what
particular
advantage
i
should
gain
if
i
did
open
an
account
of
this
sort
you
do
you
surprise
me
you
really
do
here
are
you
with
these
additional
hours
lying
idle
on
your
hands
you
did
expect
and
do
want
but
how
do
you
know
that
you
be
glad
of
at
some
time
or
other
just
think
how
grateful
you
might
be
hereafter
if
you
could
get
back
a
single
one
of
these
which
you
find
so
tedious
now
on
board
a
fine
ship
like
this
splendid
weather
bracing
perfect
rest
pleasant
company
and
so
on
why
you
be
willing
to
pay
any
money
for
it
well
bank
your
extra
time
and
you
can
draw
every
individual
hour
in
quarters
halves
or
wholes
when
you
please
and
you
please
the
advantage
of
it
sir
i
think
i
see
said
peter
only
how
am
i
to
make
the
deposit
in
the
first
instance
that
easily
arranged
the
captain
ca
compel
you
to
accept
the
time
now
by
merely
putting
back
the
hands
of
the
clock
can
he
so
all
have
to
do
is
to
abstain
from
altering
your
watch
so
long
as
you
are
on
board
and
to
fill
up
a
little
form
after
which
i
shall
be
happy
to
supply
you
with
a
book
of
time
cheques
which
you
can
fill
up
and
present
whenever
you
wish
to
spend
a
given
number
of
minutes
in
the
pleasantest
possible
of
ways
but
where
am
i
to
present
these
cheques
inquired
peter
oh
said
the
manager
there
will
be
no
difficulty
whatever
about
that
any
clock
will
cash
it
for
you
provided
of
course
that
it
has
stopped
you
merely
have
to
slip
your
cheque
underneath
or
behind
it
and
you
will
at
once
be
paid
whatever
amount
of
time
the
cheque
is
drawn
for
i
can
show
you
one
of
our
forms
if
you
like
here
he
brought
out
a
bulky
leather
case
from
which
he
extracted
a
printed
document
which
he
handed
to
peter
peter
however
being
naturally
cautious
felt
a
hesitation
which
he
scarcely
liked
to
confess
you
see
he
said
the
fact
is
i
should
like
to
know
first
i
never
been
engaged
in
a
a
transaction
of
this
kind
before
and
well
what
i
mean
is
do
i
incur
any
risk
of
er
a
supernatural
character
it
is
like
that
business
of
faust
eh
do
you
know
the
manager
took
back
the
paper
with
an
abruptness
which
showed
that
his
temper
was
ruffled
by
this
suspicion
my
good
sir
he
said
with
a
short
offended
laugh
do
on
any
account
imagine
that
care
two
pins
whether
you
become
a
depositor
or
not
i
daresay
our
house
will
continue
to
exist
without
your
account
as
for
liability
ours
is
a
limited
concern
and
besides
a
deposit
would
not
constitute
you
a
shareholder
if
you
meant
anything
more
well
i
have
still
to
learn
that
anything
diabolical
about
sir
i
simply
thought
i
was
doing
you
a
good
turn
by
making
the
suggestion
and
besides
as
a
business
man
i
never
neglect
any
opportunity
however
small
but
it
entirely
as
you
please
i
sure
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
demoniacal
even
in
his
annoyance
and
peter
was
moved
to
contrition
and
apology
i
i
really
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
do
hope
i
offended
you
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
shall
consider
it
a
personal
favour
to
be
allowed
to
open
an
account
with
your
bank
it
would
certainty
be
a
great
convenience
to
draw
some
of
this
superfluous
time
at
some
future
day
instead
of
wasting
it
now
where
do
i
sign
the
form
the
manager
was
appeased
and
produced
the
form
once
more
indicating
the
place
for
the
signature
and
even
providing
a
for
the
purpose
it
was
still
somewhat
of
a
relief
to
peter
mind
to
find
that
the
ink
it
contained
was
of
the
ordinary
black
hue
and
now
about
cheques
said
his
friend
after
the
signature
had
been
obtained
how
many
do
you
think
you
would
require
i
should
say
that
as
the
deposit
is
rather
small
you
will
find
fifty
more
than
sufficient
we
shall
debit
you
with
fifty
seconds
to
cover
the
and
we
always
recommend
cheques
as
on
the
whole
more
convenient
peter
said
he
would
have
fifty
bearer
cheques
and
was
accordingly
given
an
oblong
book
which
except
that
it
was
a
trifle
smaller
was
in
nowise
different
outwardly
from
an
ordinary
still
his
curiosity
was
not
completely
satisfied
there
is
just
one
question
more
he
said
when
i
draw
this
time
where
will
it
be
spent
why
naturally
on
board
this
ship
explained
the
manager
you
see
that
the
time
you
will
get
must
necessarily
be
the
extra
time
to
which
you
are
entitled
by
virtue
of
your
passage
and
which
you
have
spent
as
it
accrued
if
you
had
not
chosen
to
deposit
it
with
us
by
the
way
when
you
are
filling
up
cheques
we
much
prefer
not
to
be
called
upon
to
honour
drafts
for
less
than
fifteen
minutes
as
much
more
as
you
like
but
not
less
well
then
we
may
consider
that
settled
i
am
extremely
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
obliging
you
and
i
think
i
can
promise
that
you
will
have
no
reason
to
repent
of
having
made
such
a
use
of
your
time
i
wish
you
for
the
present
sir
the
manager
resumed
his
hygienic
tramp
round
the
deck
leaving
peter
with
the
in
his
hand
he
was
no
longer
surprised
now
that
he
was
more
familiar
with
the
idea
it
seemed
a
perfectly
natural
and
arrangement
he
only
wondered
that
he
had
never
thought
of
so
obvious
a
plan
before
and
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
know
that
he
had
got
rid
of
his
extra
hours
for
the
present
at
all
events
and
that
he
could
now
postpone
them
to
a
period
at
which
they
would
be
a
boon
rather
than
a
burden
and
very
soon
he
put
the
away
and
forgot
all
about
it
the
story
chapter
tourmalin
first
cheque
and
how
he
took
it
timely
experiment
and
some
startling
peter
tourmalin
probation
was
at
an
end
and
what
was
more
he
had
come
through
the
ordeal
triumphantly
how
he
managed
this
he
scarcely
knew
no
doubt
he
was
aided
by
the
consciousness
that
the
extra
hours
which
he
felt
himself
most
liable
to
had
been
placed
beyond
his
disposal
at
all
events
when
he
met
sophia
again
he
had
been
able
to
convince
her
that
her
doubts
of
his
constancy
even
under
the
most
trying
conditions
were
entirely
undeserved
now
he
was
receiving
his
recompense
his
engagement
to
sophia
was
no
longer
conditional
but
a
recognised
and
irrevocable
fact
it
is
superfluous
to
say
that
he
was
happy
sophia
had
set
herself
to
repair
the
deficiencies
in
his
education
and
culture
she
took
him
to
scientific
lectures
and
classical
concerts
and
made
him
read
standard
authors
without
skipping
he
felt
himself
daily
acquiring
balance
and
seriousness
and
an
accurate
habit
of
thought
and
all
the
other
qualities
which
sophia
wished
him
to
cultivate
still
there
were
moments
when
he
felt
the
need
of
halting
and
recovering
his
wind
so
to
speak
in
the
steep
and
toilsome
climb
to
her
superior
mental
level
times
when
he
felt
that
his
overtaxed
brain
absolutely
required
relaxation
of
some
sort
he
felt
this
particularly
one
dreary
morning
late
in
november
as
he
sat
in
his
london
chambers
staring
with
eyes
at
the
letter
he
had
that
day
received
from
his
betrothed
for
although
they
met
nearly
every
day
she
never
allowed
one
to
pass
without
a
letter
no
fond
and
foolish
effusion
be
it
understood
but
a
kind
of
epistolary
to
test
the
progress
he
was
making
this
one
contained
some
searching
questions
on
of
which
he
was
expected
to
answer
by
return
of
post
he
was
not
supposed
to
look
at
the
book
though
he
had
and
even
then
he
felt
himself
scarcely
better
fitted
to
floor
the
tremendous
posers
devised
by
sophia
unwearying
care
the
day
before
he
had
had
in
english
poetry
from
chaucer
to
lewis
morris
which
had
thinned
and
whitened
his
hair
but
this
was
if
possible
even
worse
he
wished
now
that
he
had
got
up
his
buckle
more
thoroughly
during
his
voyage
on
the
and
with
the
name
his
arrangement
with
the
manager
suddenly
rose
to
his
recollection
what
had
he
done
with
that
book
of
time
cheques
if
he
could
only
get
away
if
but
for
a
quarter
of
a
hour
away
from
those
sombre
rooms
with
their
outlook
on
dingy
housetops
and
a
murky
sky
if
he
could
really
exchange
all
that
for
the
sunniness
and
warmth
and
delicious
idleness
which
had
once
seemed
so
tedious
what
a
rest
it
would
be
and
would
he
not
return
after
such
an
interlude
with
all
his
faculties
invigorated
and
better
able
to
cope
with
the
task
he
now
found
almost
insuperable
the
first
thing
was
to
find
the
which
did
not
take
him
long
though
when
he
had
found
it
something
made
him
pause
before
filling
up
a
cheque
what
if
he
had
been
made
a
fool
of
if
the
joint
stock
time
bank
limited
never
existed
or
had
suspended
payment
but
that
was
easily
settled
by
presenting
a
cheque
why
should
he
not
just
by
way
of
experiment
his
balance
was
intact
as
yet
he
was
never
likely
to
need
a
little
ready
time
more
than
he
did
just
then
he
would
draw
the
minimum
amount
fifteen
minutes
and
see
how
the
system
worked
so
although
he
had
little
real
confidence
that
anything
would
happen
at
all
he
drew
a
cheque
and
slipped
it
behind
the
frivolous
and
rather
incorrect
little
ormolu
clock
upon
his
chimneypiece
the
result
was
instantaneous
and
altogether
beyond
his
expectations
the
four
walls
of
his
room
assumed
the
transparency
of
gauze
for
a
second
before
fading
entirely
away
the
olive
fog
changed
to
translucent
blue
there
was
a
briny
breath
in
the
air
and
he
himself
was
leaning
upon
the
rail
at
the
forward
end
of
the
of
the
which
was
riding
with
a
slow
and
stately
rise
and
fall
over
the
heaving
swell
that
was
surprising
enough
but
more
surprising
still
was
the
discovery
that
he
was
apparently
engaged
in
close
and
confidential
conversation
with
a
lovely
person
in
whom
he
distinctly
recognised
miss
tyrrell
yes
i
forgive
you
tourmalin
she
was
saying
with
an
evident
effort
to
suppress
a
certain
agitation
but
indeed
you
must
never
speak
to
me
like
that
again
now
as
peter
was
certainly
not
conscious
of
ever
having
spoken
to
her
at
all
in
his
life
this
was
naturally
a
startling
and
even
embarrassing
beginning
but
he
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
take
in
the
position
of
affairs
and
adapt
himself
to
them
this
was
one
of
the
quarters
of
an
hour
he
have
had
and
it
was
clear
that
in
some
portion
or
other
of
his
spare
time
he
would
have
made
miss
tyrrell
acquaintance
in
some
way
of
course
he
ought
to
have
been
paid
that
particular
time
first
but
he
could
easily
see
from
her
manner
and
the
almost
tender
friendliness
which
shone
in
her
moistened
eyes
that
at
this
period
they
had
advanced
considerably
beyond
mere
acquaintanceship
there
had
been
some
little
mistake
probably
the
cheques
had
been
wrongly
numbered
perhaps
or
else
they
were
honoured
without
regard
to
chronological
sequence
which
was
most
confusing
still
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
conceal
his
ignorance
as
well
as
he
could
and
pick
up
the
loose
threads
as
he
went
along
he
was
able
at
all
events
to
assure
her
that
he
would
not
if
he
could
help
it
incur
her
displeasure
by
speaking
to
her
like
that
in
future
thanks
she
said
i
know
it
was
only
a
temporary
forgetfulness
and
and
if
what
you
suspect
should
prove
to
be
really
true
why
then
tourmalin
then
of
course
you
may
come
and
tell
me
so
i
will
he
said
i
shall
make
a
point
of
it
only
he
thought
to
himself
she
will
have
to
tell
me
first
i
to
tell
her
and
in
the
meantime
she
said
let
us
go
on
as
before
as
if
you
had
never
brought
yourself
to
confide
your
sad
story
to
me
so
he
had
told
a
sad
story
had
he
he
thought
much
bewildered
for
as
he
had
no
story
belonging
to
him
of
that
character
he
was
afraid
he
must
have
invented
one
while
of
course
he
could
not
ask
for
information
yes
he
said
with
great
presence
of
mind
forget
my
unhappy
story
let
it
never
be
mentioned
between
us
again
we
will
go
on
as
before
as
before
it
is
our
only
course
she
agreed
and
now
she
added
with
a
cheerfulness
that
struck
him
as
a
little
forced
suppose
we
talk
of
something
else
peter
considered
this
a
good
suggestion
provided
it
was
a
subject
he
knew
a
little
more
about
which
unhappily
it
was
not
you
never
answered
my
question
she
reminded
him
he
would
have
liked
as
ministers
say
in
the
house
previous
notice
of
that
question
but
he
could
hardly
say
so
in
so
many
words
no
he
said
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
it
is
a
a
painful
subject
to
me
i
understand
that
she
said
gently
it
was
more
than
did
but
tell
me
only
this
was
it
that
made
you
behave
as
you
did
you
are
sure
you
had
no
reason
if
i
say
i
had
thought
peter
she
will
ask
me
what
it
was
i
will
be
as
frank
as
possible
miss
tyrrell
he
replied
i
had
other
reason
what
other
reason
i
have
had
i
half
fancied
but
i
ought
to
have
seen
from
the
first
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
not
that
and
now
you
have
made
everything
quite
clear
i
am
glad
you
find
it
so
said
peter
with
a
touch
of
envy
but
i
might
have
gone
on
misunderstanding
and
misjudging
putting
you
down
as
proud
and
cold
and
unsociable
or
prejudiced
but
for
the
accident
which
brought
us
together
in
spite
of
your
determination
that
we
should
remain
total
strangers
it
was
an
which
had
made
them
acquainted
then
he
would
draw
the
cheque
which
contained
that
episode
of
his
extra
time
sooner
or
later
but
it
was
distinctly
inconvenient
not
to
have
at
least
idea
of
what
had
happened
a
fortunate
accident
for
me
at
all
events
he
said
with
a
judicious
recourse
to
compliment
it
might
have
been
a
very
unfortunate
one
for
poor
papa
she
said
but
for
you
i
do
believe
he
would
have
been
quite
inconsolable
peter
felt
an
agreeable
shock
had
he
really
been
fortunate
enough
to
distinguish
himself
by
rescuing
the
judge
fair
daughter
from
some
deadly
peril
it
looked
very
like
it
he
had
often
suspected
himself
of
a
latent
heroism
which
had
never
had
an
opportunity
of
being
displayed
this
opportunity
must
have
occurred
and
he
have
proved
equal
to
the
occasion
in
one
of
those
extra
hours
i
can
quite
imagine
that
he
would
be
inconsolable
indeed
he
said
gallantly
fortunately
i
was
privileged
to
prevent
such
a
calamity
tell
me
again
exactly
you
did
it
she
said
i
never
quite
understood
peter
again
took
refuge
in
a
discreet
vagueness
oh
he
replied
modestly
there
not
much
to
tell
i
saw
the
er
danger
and
knew
there
was
a
moment
to
lose
and
then
i
sprang
forward
and
well
you
know
the
rest
as
well
as
i
do
you
only
just
caught
him
as
he
was
going
up
the
rigging
you
she
asked
so
it
was
the
judge
he
had
saved
not
his
daughter
peter
felt
a
natural
disappointment
but
he
saw
the
state
of
the
case
now
a
powerful
judicial
intellect
overstrained
melancholia
suicidal
impulses
it
was
all
very
sad
but
happily
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
this
man
to
his
country
i
ventured
to
detain
him
he
said
considerately
seeing
that
he
was
er
rather
excited
but
were
you
afraid
he
would
bite
you
no
said
peter
pained
at
this
revelation
of
the
condition
that
possibility
did
occur
to
me
in
fact
i
am
sure
that
er
though
the
strongest
intellects
are
occasionally
subject
to
attacks
of
this
sort
he
would
never
so
far
forget
himself
as
to
er
bite
a
complete
stranger
ah
she
said
you
do
know
what
a
savage
old
creature
he
can
be
sometimes
he
never
ought
to
be
let
loose
i
sure
dangerous
oh
but
think
miss
tyrrell
remonstrated
peter
unmistakably
shocked
at
this
unfilial
attitude
towards
a
distinguished
parent
if
he
was
er
dangerous
he
would
not
be
upon
the
bench
now
surely
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
with
evident
apprehension
how
you
frightened
me
she
said
i
thought
he
was
really
there
but
i
hope
they
shut
him
up
in
future
so
that
he
wo
be
able
to
do
any
more
mischief
you
did
tell
me
how
you
got
hold
of
him
was
it
by
his
chain
or
his
tail
peter
did
not
know
and
besides
it
was
as
difficult
for
him
to
picture
himself
in
the
act
of
seizing
a
hypochondriacal
judge
by
his
or
as
it
was
for
him
to
comprehend
the
utter
want
of
feeling
that
could
prompt
such
a
question
from
the
sufferer
own
daughter
i
hope
he
said
with
a
gravity
which
he
intended
as
a
rebuke
i
hope
i
treated
him
with
all
the
respect
and
consideration
possible
under
the
er
circumstances
i
am
sorry
that
that
remark
appears
to
amuse
you
for
miss
tyrrell
was
actually
laughing
with
a
merriment
in
which
there
was
nothing
forced
how
can
i
help
it
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
it
is
too
funny
to
hear
you
talking
of
being
regretful
and
considerate
to
a
horrid
monkey
a
he
repeated
involuntarily
so
it
was
a
monkey
that
was
under
restraint
and
not
a
judge
of
her
majesty
supreme
court
of
judicature
a
discovery
which
left
him
as
much
in
the
dark
as
to
what
particular
service
he
had
rendered
as
ever
and
made
him
tremble
to
think
what
he
might
have
said
but
apparently
by
singular
good
fortune
he
had
not
committed
himself
beyond
recovery
for
miss
tyrrell
only
said
i
thought
you
were
speaking
of
the
monkey
the
little
wretch
that
came
up
behind
papa
and
snatched
away
all
his
notes
the
notes
he
had
made
for
the
great
case
he
tried
last
term
and
has
to
deliver
judgment
upon
when
the
courts
sit
again
surely
he
told
you
how
important
they
were
and
how
awkward
it
would
have
been
if
the
monkey
had
escaped
with
them
and
torn
them
into
pieces
or
dropped
them
into
the
sea
as
he
probably
would
have
done
but
for
you
oh
ah
yes
said
peter
feeling
slightly
crestfallen
for
he
had
hoped
he
had
performed
a
more
dashing
deed
than
catching
a
loose
monkey
i
believe
your
father
sir
john
he
hazarded
sir
william
of
course
thank
you
did
mention
the
fact
but
it
really
was
such
a
trifling
thing
to
do
papa
did
think
so
she
said
he
declares
he
can
never
be
grateful
enough
to
you
and
whatever
it
was
she
added
softly
and
even
shyly
i
at
least
can
never
think
lightly
of
a
service
which
has
has
made
us
what
we
are
to
one
another
they
were
to
one
another
and
what
was
a
dreadful
uncertainty
seized
upon
peter
was
it
possible
that
in
some
way
he
did
not
understand
he
was
engaged
to
this
very
charming
girl
who
was
almost
a
stranger
to
him
the
mere
idea
froze
his
blood
for
if
that
was
so
how
did
it
affect
his
position
towards
sophia
at
all
hazards
he
must
know
the
worst
at
once
tell
me
he
said
with
trembling
accents
i
know
you
have
told
me
already
but
tell
me
once
more
precisely
what
we
are
to
one
another
at
present
it
would
be
so
much
more
satisfactory
to
my
mind
he
added
in
a
deprecatory
tone
to
have
that
clearly
understood
i
thought
i
had
made
it
quite
clear
already
she
said
with
the
least
suspicion
of
coldness
that
we
can
be
nothing
more
to
one
another
than
friends
the
relief
was
almost
too
much
for
him
what
a
dear
good
sensible
girl
she
was
how
perfectly
she
appreciated
the
facts
he
cried
is
that
do
you
really
mean
we
are
nothing
more
than
friends
he
caught
her
hand
in
the
fervour
of
his
gratitude
and
she
allowed
it
to
remain
in
his
grasp
which
in
the
altered
state
of
things
he
found
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
ah
she
murmured
do
ask
me
for
more
than
i
have
said
more
than
i
can
ever
say
perhaps
let
us
be
content
with
remaining
friends
dear
friends
if
you
like
but
no
more
i
will
said
peter
promptly
i
will
be
content
dear
friends
by
all
means
but
no
more
no
she
assented
unless
a
time
should
come
when
yes
said
peter
encouragingly
as
she
hesitated
you
were
about
to
say
a
time
when
her
lips
moved
a
faint
flush
stole
into
her
cheeks
she
was
about
to
complete
her
sentence
when
her
hand
seemed
to
melt
away
in
his
own
and
he
stood
grasping
the
empty
air
by
his
own
mantelpiece
the
upper
deck
the
heaving
bows
the
blue
seaboard
miss
tyrrell
herself
all
had
vanished
and
in
their
stead
were
the
familiar
surroundings
of
his
chamber
the
grimy
london
house
fronts
and
sophia
list
of
questions
lying
still
unanswered
upon
his
his
fifteen
minutes
had
come
to
an
end
the
cheque
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
of
his
clock
had
not
moved
since
he
last
saw
it
but
this
last
circumstance
as
he
saw
on
reflection
was
only
natural
for
otherwise
the
time
deposit
would
have
conferred
no
real
advantage
as
he
would
never
have
regained
the
hours
he
had
temporarily
foregone
for
some
time
peter
sat
perfectly
still
with
his
head
between
his
hands
occupied
in
a
mental
review
of
this
his
initial
experience
of
the
system
it
was
as
different
as
possible
from
the
spell
of
perfect
rest
he
had
anticipated
but
had
it
been
unpleasant
on
that
account
in
spite
of
an
element
of
mystification
at
starting
which
was
inevitable
he
was
obliged
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
enjoyed
this
little
adventure
more
than
perhaps
he
should
have
done
with
all
his
attachment
to
sophia
he
could
hardly
be
insensible
to
the
privilege
of
suddenly
finding
himself
the
friend
and
more
than
that
the
dear
friend
of
so
delightful
a
girl
as
this
miss
tyrrell
there
was
a
strange
charm
a
peculiar
and
quite
platonic
tenderness
about
an
intimacy
of
this
peculiar
and
unprecedented
nature
which
increased
at
every
fresh
recollection
of
it
it
increased
so
rapidly
indeed
that
almost
unconsciously
he
drew
the
towards
him
and
began
to
fill
up
another
cheque
with
a
view
to
an
immediate
return
to
the
but
when
he
had
torn
the
cheque
out
he
hesitated
it
was
all
quite
harmless
the
most
severe
moralist
could
not
convict
him
of
even
the
most
shadowy
infidelity
towards
his
if
he
chose
to
go
back
and
follow
up
a
purely
retrospective
episode
like
this
an
episode
which
interested
and
fascinated
him
so
strongly
only
what
would
sophia
say
to
it
instinctively
he
felt
that
the
situation
innocent
as
it
was
would
fail
to
commend
itself
to
her
he
had
no
intention
of
informing
her
it
was
true
but
he
knew
that
he
was
a
poor
dissembler
he
might
easily
betray
himself
in
some
unguarded
moment
and
then
no
it
was
vexing
no
doubt
but
upon
the
whole
it
was
wiser
and
better
to
renounce
those
additional
hours
on
board
the
altogether
to
allow
this
past
that
never
had
but
only
might
have
been
to
remain
unsummoned
and
unknown
for
ever
otherwise
who
could
tell
that
by
gradual
assaults
even
such
an
affection
as
he
had
for
sophia
might
not
be
eventually
undermined
but
this
fear
as
he
saw
the
next
moment
was
almost
too
extravagant
to
be
seriously
taken
into
account
he
felt
nothing
and
never
could
feel
anything
but
warm
and
sincere
friendship
for
miss
tyrrell
and
it
was
satisfactory
to
know
that
she
was
in
no
danger
of
mistaking
his
sentiments
still
of
course
there
was
always
a
certain
risk
particularly
when
he
was
necessarily
in
ignorance
of
all
that
had
preceded
and
followed
the
only
colloquy
they
had
had
as
yet
at
last
he
decided
upon
a
compromise
he
would
not
cash
that
second
cheque
for
the
present
at
all
events
he
would
reserve
it
for
an
emergency
and
only
use
it
if
he
was
absolutely
driven
to
do
so
as
a
mental
tonic
perhaps
sophia
would
not
compel
him
to
such
a
necessity
again
he
hoped
at
least
he
she
would
not
so
he
put
the
unpresented
cheque
in
an
inner
pocket
and
set
to
work
with
desperate
energy
at
his
although
his
recent
change
must
have
proved
less
stimulating
to
his
jaded
faculties
than
he
had
hoped
since
sophia
after
reading
his
answers
made
the
cutting
remark
that
she
scarcely
knew
which
he
had
more
completely
failed
to
apprehend
the
purport
of
his
author
or
that
of
the
very
simple
questions
she
had
set
him
peter
could
not
help
thinking
rather
ruefully
that
miss
tyrrell
would
never
have
been
capable
of
such
severity
as
that
but
then
miss
tyrrell
was
not
his
only
a
very
dear
friend
whom
he
would
most
probably
never
meet
again
chapter

the
second

cosy
sitting
out
a
and
the
knowledge
that
one
has
a
remedy
within
reach
is
often
as
effectual
as
the
remedy
itself
if
not
more
so
which
may
account
for
the
fact
that
although
a
considerable
number
of
weeks
had
elapsed
since
peter
tourmalin
had
drawn
his
second
cheque
on
the
joint
stock
time
bank
limited
that
cheque
still
remained
unpresented
the
day
fixed
for
his
wedding
with
sophia
was
drawing
near
the
flat
in
the
marylebone
road
which
was
to
be
the
scene
of
their
joint
felicity
had
to
be
furnished
and
this
occupied
most
of
his
time
sophia
took
the
entire
business
upon
herself
for
she
had
scientific
theories
on
the
subject
of
decoration
and
colour
harmonies
which
peter
could
only
accept
with
admiring
awe
but
nevertheless
she
required
him
to
be
constantly
at
hand
so
that
she
could
consult
him
after
her
own
mind
had
been
irrevocably
made
up
one
february
afternoon
he
was
wandering
rather
disconsolately
about
the
labyrinthine
passages
of
one
of
the
monster
upholstery
establishments
in
the
tottenham
court
road
his
chief
object
being
to
evade
the
courtesies
of
the
numerous
assistants
as
they
anxiously
inquired
what
they
might
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
him
he
and
sophia
had
been
there
since
and
she
had
sat
in
judgment
upon
carpets
which
were
brought
out
plunging
like
unbroken
colts
by
panting
foremen
and
unrolled
before
her
in
a
blinding
riot
of
colour
peter
had
only
to
express
the
mildest
commendation
of
any
carpet
to
seal
that
carpet
doom
instantly
so
that
he
soon
abstained
from
personal
interference
now
sophia
was
in
the
ironmongery
department
choosing
kitchen
utensils
and
his
opinion
being
naturally
of
no
value
on
such
matters
he
was
free
to
roam
wherever
he
pleased
within
the
limits
of
the
building
he
felt
tired
and
rather
faint
for
he
had
had
no
lunch
and
presently
he
came
to
a
series
of
fitted
up
as
rooms
in
various
styles
there
was
one
interior
with
an
elaborate
chimneypiece
which
had
cosy
cushioned
nooks
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
and
into
one
of
these
corners
he
sank
with
heartfelt
gratitude
for
it
was
a
comfortable
seat
and
he
had
not
sat
down
for
hours
but
as
his
weariness
wore
away
he
felt
the
want
of
something
to
occupy
his
mind
and
searched
in
his
pockets
to
see
if
he
had
any
letters
there
even
notes
of
congratulation
upon
his
approaching
marriage
would
be
better
than
nothing
in
his
present
reduced
condition
but
he
had
left
all
his
correspondence
at
his
chambers
the
only
document
he
came
upon
was
the
identical
time
cheque
he
had
drawn
long
ago
it
was
creased
and
rumpled
but
none
the
less
negotiable
if
he
could
find
a
clock
and
on
the
chimneypiece
there
was
a
clock
a
small
affair
surmounted
by
a
japanese
monster
in
moreover
by
some
chance
this
clock
was
actually
going
he
could
hear
it
ticking
as
he
sat
there
should
he
present
his
cheque
or
not
he
was
feeling
a
little
aggrieved
at
sophia
treatment
of
him
she
had
snubbed
him
so
unmercifully
over
the
carpets
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
if
he
chose
he
could
transport
himself
that
very
instant
to
the
society
of
a
sweet
and
appreciative
companion
from
whom
snubbing
was
the
last
thing
to
be
apprehended
yes
sophia
treatment
quite
justified
him
in
making
an
exception
to
the
rule
he
had
laid
down
for
himself
he
present
that
cheque
and
he
rose
softly
from
his
seat
and
pushed
the
cheque
under
the
little
timepiece
as
before
his
draft
was
honoured
immediately
he
found
himself
on
a
in
a
sheltered
passage
between
two
of
the
it
was
night
and
he
could
not
clearly
distinguish
any
objects
around
him
for
some
little
time
owing
to
the
darkness
but
from
a
glimmer
of
white
drapery
that
was
faintly
visible
close
by
he
easily
inferred
that
there
was
another
chair
adjoining
his
which
could
only
be
occupied
by
miss
tyrrell
he
could
just
hear
the
ship
band
playing
a
waltz
at
the
further
end
of
the
ship
it
was
one
of
the
evenings
when
there
had
been
dancing
and
he
and
miss
tyrrell
were
sitting
out
together
all
this
he
realised
instantly
and
not
without
a
thrill
of
interest
and
expectation
which
however
the
first
words
she
uttered
were
sufficient
to
reduce
to
the
most
prosaic
perplexity
what
have
i
said
she
was
moaning
in
a
voice
hardly
recognisable
from
emotion
and
the
fleecy
wrap
in
which
her
face
was
muffled
oh
what
i
said
peter
was
naturally
powerless
to
afford
her
any
information
on
this
point
even
if
she
really
required
it
he
made
a
rapid
mental
note
to
the
effect
that
their
intimacy
had
evidently
made
great
progress
since
their
last
interview
i
afraid
he
said
deciding
that
candour
was
his
only
course
i
ca
exactly
tell
you
what
you
did
say
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
quite
catch
it
ah
you
say
that
to
spare
me
she
murmured
you
have
heard
but
promise
me
you
will
forget
it
willingly
said
peter
with
the
greatest
readiness
to
oblige
i
will
consider
it
forgotten
if
i
could
but
hope
that
she
said
and
yet
she
added
recklessly
why
should
i
care
what
i
say
to
be
sure
agreed
tourmalin
at
random
why
you
you
know
you
must
have
seen
from
the
first
that
i
was
very
far
from
being
happy
i
must
confess
said
peter
with
the
air
of
a
man
whom
nothing
escaped
that
i
observe
that
and
you
were
right
was
it
unnatural
that
i
should
be
nothing
but
grateful
to
the
chance
which
first
brought
us
together
not
at
all
said
peter
delighted
to
feel
himself
on
solid
ground
again
indeed
if
i
may
speak
for
myself
i
have
even
greater
reason
to
feel
grateful
to
that
monkey
to
monkey
she
exclaimed
why
naturally
my
dear
miss
tyrrell
to
the
animal
which
was
the
unconscious
instrument
in
making
us
acquainted
you
surely
can
not
have
forgotten
already
that
it
a
monkey
she
half
rose
with
an
impetuous
movement
the
mantilla
fell
from
her
face
and
even
in
the
faint
starlight
he
could
perceive
that
beautiful
as
that
face
undoubtedly
was
it
was
as
certainly
not
the
face
of
miss
tyrrell
seem
to
have
forgotten
a
great
deal
she
retorted
with
a
suppressed
sob
in
her
voice
or
you
would
at
least
remember
that
my
name
is
davenport
why
you
should
choose
to
call
me
miss
tyrrell
whom
i
do
even
know
by
sight
i
ca
conceive
here
was
a
discovery
and
a
startling
one
it
appeared
that
he
had
not
merely
one
but
two
dear
friends
on
board
this
and
steamer
and
the
second
seemed
if
possible
even
dearer
than
the
first
he
must
have
made
the
very
most
of
those
extra
hours
there
was
one
comfort
however
miss
davenport
did
not
contrary
to
his
impression
know
miss
tyrrell
so
that
they
need
not
necessarily
clash
still
it
was
undeniably
awkward
he
had
to
get
out
of
his
mistake
as
well
as
he
could
which
was
but
lamely
why
of
he
protested
i
know
are
miss
davenport
most
stupid
of
me
to
address
you
as
miss
tyrrell
the
the
only
explanation
i
can
offer
is
that
before
i
had
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
you
i
was
under
the
impression
that
your
proper
name
was
and
so
it
slipped
out
again
just
then
from
habit
this
though
the
literal
if
not
the
moral
truth
did
not
seem
to
satisfy
her
entirely
that
may
be
so
she
said
curtly
still
it
does
not
explain
why
you
should
address
me
as
anybody
after
asking
and
receiving
permission
only
last
night
to
call
me
by
my
christian
name
obviously
their
relations
were
even
closer
than
he
had
imagined
he
had
no
idea
they
had
got
as
far
as
christian
names
already
any
more
than
he
had
of
what
hers
might
happen
to
be
there
was
a
painful
want
of
method
in
the
manner
this
time
bank
conducted
its
business
as
he
could
not
help
remarking
to
himself
however
peter
perhaps
from
the
very
timidity
in
his
character
developed
unexpected
adroitness
in
a
situation
of
some
difficulty
so
you
did
he
said
you
allowed
me
to
call
you
by
your
er
christian
name
but
i
value
such
a
privilege
too
highly
to
use
it
er
indiscriminately
you
are
very
strange
she
said
with
a
plaintive
and
almost
childish
quiver
of
the
lip
first
you
call
me
tyrrell
and
then
davenport
and
then
you
will
have
it
that
we
were
introduced
by
a
monkey
as
if
i
should
ever
allow
a
monkey
to
introduce
to
me
is
saving
a
girl
life
such
an
ordinary
event
with
you
that
you
forget
all
about
such
a
trifle
this
last
sentence
compensated
peter
for
all
that
had
gone
before
here
was
a
person
whose
life
he
really
saved
and
his
heart
warmed
to
her
from
that
moment
rescuing
a
girl
from
imminent
bodily
peril
was
a
more
heroic
achievement
than
capturing
the
most
mischievous
of
monkeys
and
besides
he
felt
it
was
far
more
in
his
style
so
it
was
in
his
best
manner
he
replied
to
her
question
it
would
be
strange
indeed
he
said
reproachfully
if
i
could
ever
forget
that
i
was
the
humble
means
of
preserving
you
from
from
a
watery
grave
he
risked
the
epithet
concluding
that
on
a
voyage
it
could
hardly
be
any
other
description
of
grave
and
she
did
not
challenge
it
so
he
continued
a
watery
grave
but
i
hoped
you
would
appreciate
the
motive
which
restrained
me
from
er
seeming
to
dwell
upon
such
a
circumstance
this
appeal
unprincipled
as
it
was
subdued
her
instantly
oh
forgive
me
she
said
putting
out
her
hand
with
the
prettiest
penitence
i
might
have
known
you
better
than
that
i
did
mean
it
please
say
you
forgive
me
and
and
call
me
maud
again
relief
at
being
supplied
with
a
missing
clue
made
peter
reckless
indeed
it
is
to
be
feared
that
demoralisation
had
already
set
in
he
took
the
hand
she
gave
him
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
let
it
go
immediately
maud
then
he
said
obediently
i
forgive
you
maud
it
was
a
prettier
name
to
pronounce
than
sophia
how
curious
it
is
she
was
saying
dreamily
as
she
nestled
comfortably
in
her
chair
beside
him
that
up
to
the
very
moment
when
you
rushed
forward
that
day
i
scarcely
gave
your
existence
a
thought
and
now
how
little
we
ever
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to
us
do
we
or
what
happened
for
that
matter
he
thought
this
time
he
would
not
commit
himself
to
details
until
he
could
learn
more
about
the
precise
nature
of
his
dauntless
act
which
he
at
once
proceeded
to
do
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
he
suggested
what
your
sensations
were
at
that
critical
moment
my
sensations
i
hardly
know
she
said
i
remember
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
is
it
peter
said
it
bulwarks
the
bulwarks
watching
a
sailor
in
a
little
balcony
below
who
was
doing
something
with
a
long
line
heaving
the
lead
said
peter
so
he
was
go
on
he
was
intensely
excited
it
was
all
plain
enough
she
had
lost
her
balance
and
fallen
overboard
he
had
plunged
in
and
gallantly
kept
her
above
water
till
help
arrived
he
had
always
known
he
was
capable
of
this
sort
of
thing
now
he
had
proved
it
when
all
at
once
she
continued
i
felt
myself
roughly
dragged
back
by
somebody
that
was
you
i
was
rather
angry
for
the
moment
for
it
seem
quite
a
liberty
for
a
total
stranger
to
take
when
that
very
instant
i
saw
the
line
with
a
great
heavy
lump
of
lead
at
the
end
of
it
whirled
round
exactly
where
my
head
had
been
and
then
i
knew
that
i
owed
my
life
to
your
presence
of
mind
peter
was
more
than
disappointed
he
was
positively
disgusted
at
this
exceedingly
tame
conclusion
it
seem
hard
that
even
under
conditions
when
any
act
of
daring
might
have
been
possible
to
him
he
could
do
nothing
more
brilliant
than
this
it
was
really
worse
than
the
monkey
business
i
afraid
you
make
too
much
of
the
very
little
i
did
he
said
do
i
perhaps
that
is
because
if
you
had
not
done
it
we
should
never
have
come
to
know
one
another
as
we
do
so
far
it
was
a
very
sort
of
knowledge
peter
thought
and
yet
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
sometimes
think
that
we
should
both
be
happier
if
we
never
known
one
another
if
you
had
stood
aside
and
the
lead
had
struck
me
and
i
had
died
no
no
said
peter
unfeignedly
alarmed
at
this
morbid
reflection
you
must
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
it
as
all
that
you
know
why
not
she
said
in
a
sombre
tone
it
gloomy
gloomy
i
know
better
than
you
she
might
well
do
that
thought
tourmalin
why
did
i
not
see
that
i
was
slowly
imperceptibly
drifting
drifting
well
said
peter
with
a
levity
he
was
far
from
feeling
if
the
drifting
was
imperceptible
you
naturally
see
it
you
know
you
might
have
spared
a
joke
at
such
a
time
as
this
she
cried
indignantly
i
i
was
aware
there
was
a
close
time
for
jokes
he
said
humbly
not
that
it
was
much
of
a
joke
indeed
it
was
not
she
replied
but
oh
peter
we
have
both
drifted
have
we
he
exclaimed
blankly
i
i
mean
we
i
was
so
blind
so
wilfully
foolishly
blind
i
told
myself
we
were
friends
surely
we
are
he
said
retaking
possession
of
her
hand
he
had
entirely
forgotten
sophia
in
the
ironmongery
department
at
tottenham
court
road
i
i
understood
we
were
on
that
footing
no
she
said
let
us
have
no
subterfuges
any
more
we
must
look
facts
in
the
face
after
what
we
have
both
said
we
can
no
longer
deceive
ourselves
by
words
peter
she
broke
off
suddenly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
and
on
your
answer
my
fate
and
yours
too
perhaps
will
depend
tell
me
truthfully
her
voice
failed
her
for
the
moment
as
she
bent
over
towards
him
and
clutched
his
arm
tightly
in
her
excitement
her
eyes
shone
with
a
wild
intense
eagerness
for
his
reply
would
you
she
repeated
would
you
have
the
all
brass
or
japanned
the
brass
ones
are
a
shilling
more
peter
gave
a
violent
start
for
the
voice
in
which
this
most
incongruous
and
irrelevant
question
was
put
was
that
of
sophia
miss
davenport
with
her
hysterical
appeal
the
and
the
starlight
all
had
fled
and
he
stood
supporting
himself
limply
by
the
arm
of
the
in
the
showroom
staring
at
sophia
who
stood
there
sedate
and
practical
inviting
his
attention
to
a
couple
of
which
an
assistant
was
displaying
with
an
obsequious
smile
the
transition
was
rather
an
abrupt
one
oh
i
think
the
brass
one
is
very
nice
he
stammered
feebly
enough
then
that
settles
it
remarked
sophia
we
take
the
one
please
she
said
to
the
assistant
are
you
feeling
well
peter
dear
she
asked
presently
in
an
undertone
you
look
so
odd
quite
well
he
said
i
ah
was
thinking
of
something
else
for
the
moment
and
you
startled
me
that
all
you
had
such
a
expression
in
your
eyes
said
sophia
and
you
did
jump
so
when
i
spoke
to
you
you
should
really
try
to
conquer
that
tendency
to
let
yourself
wander
peter
i
will
my
love
he
said
and
he
meant
it
for
he
had
let
himself
wander
farther
than
he
quite
intended
chapter
iii
the
third
cheque
farewell
profit
and
a
quick
as
the
reader
may
imagine
this
second
experience
had
an
effect
upon
peter
that
was
rather
deterrent
than
encouraging
it
was
a
painful
piece
of
to
find
that
had
he
chosen
to
avail
himself
of
the
extra
hours
on
board
the
as
they
occurred
he
would
have
so
employed
them
as
to
place
himself
in
relations
of
considerable
ambiguity
towards
two
distinct
young
ladies
how
far
he
was
committed
to
either
or
both
he
could
not
tell
but
he
had
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
neither
of
them
would
have
been
quite
so
emotional
had
he
conducted
himself
with
the
same
prudence
that
had
marked
his
behaviour
throughout
the
time
which
he
able
to
account
for
and
yet
his
conscience
acquitted
him
of
any
actual
default
if
he
had
ever
really
had
any
passages
at
all
approaching
the
sentimental
with
either
miss
tyrrell
or
miss
davenport
his
mind
could
hardly
be
so
utterly
blank
on
the
subject
as
it
certainly
was
no
at
the
worst
his
failings
were
only
potential
peccadillos
the
kind
of
weaknesses
he
might
have
given
way
to
if
he
had
not
wisely
postponed
the
hours
in
which
the
occasions
were
afforded
he
had
had
a
warning
a
practical
moral
lesson
which
had
merely
arrived
as
such
things
often
do
rather
after
date
but
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
profit
by
it
he
would
at
least
he
would
abstain
from
making
any
further
inroads
upon
the
balance
of
extra
time
which
still
remained
to
his
credit
at
the
bank
he
would
draw
no
further
cheques
he
would
return
to
that
and
steamer
no
more
for
an
engaged
man
whose
was
approaching
by
leaps
and
bounds
it
was
however
innocent
too
disturbing
and
exciting
a
form
of
distraction
to
be
quite
safely
indulged
in
the
resolution
cost
him
something
nevertheless
peter
was
not
a
man
who
had
hitherto
been
spoilt
by
feminine
adoration
sophia
was
fond
of
him
but
she
never
affected
to
place
him
upon
any
sort
of
pinnacle
on
the
contrary
she
looked
down
upon
him
protectingly
and
indulgently
from
a
moral
and
intellectual
pedestal
of
her
own
he
had
not
objected
to
this
in
fact
he
rather
liked
it
but
it
was
less
gratifying
and
stimulating
to
his
than
the
romantic
and
idealising
sentiments
which
he
had
seemingly
inspired
in
two
exceedingly
bewitching
young
persons
with
whom
he
felt
so
much
in
sympathy
it
was
an
agreeable
return
from
the
of
engaged
life
to
the
of
after
all
peter
was
but
human
and
a
man
is
seldom
esteemed
for
being
otherwise
he
could
not
help
a
natural
regret
at
having
to
abandon
experiences
which
judging
from
the
fragmentary
samples
he
had
obtained
promised
so
much
and
such
varied
interest
that
the
interest
was
not
consecutive
only
made
it
the
more
amusing
it
was
a
living
the
pieces
of
which
he
could
fit
together
as
he
received
them
it
was
tantalising
to
look
at
his
and
feel
that
upon
its
leaves
the
rest
of
the
story
was
written
but
that
he
must
never
seek
to
decipher
it
it
became
so
tantalising
that
he
locked
the
up
at
last
but
already
some
of
the
edge
had
worn
off
his
resolution
and
he
had
begun
to
see
only
the
more
seductive
side
of
interviews
which
at
the
time
had
not
been
free
from
difficulty
and
embarrassment
having
put
himself
beyond
the
reach
of
temptation
he
naturally
began
to
cast
about
for
some
excuse
for
again
exposing
himself
to
it
it
was
the
eve
of
his
he
was
in
his
chambers
for
the
last
time
and
alone
for
he
would
not
see
sophia
again
until
he
met
her
in
bridal
array
at
the
church
door
and
he
had
no
bachelor
friends
whom
he
cared
to
invite
to
help
him
to
keep
up
his
spirits
peter
was
horribly
restless
and
nervous
he
needed
a
sedative
of
some
kind
and
even
trying
on
his
wedding
garments
failed
to
soothe
him
as
he
felt
almost
certain
there
was
a
wrinkle
between
the
shoulders
and
it
was
too
late
to
have
it
altered
the
idea
of
one
more
visit
to
the
one
more
interview
the
last
with
one
or
other
of
his
amiable
and
fascinating
friends
it
did
not
matter
very
much
which
presented
itself
in
a
more
and
more
attractive
light
if
it
did
nothing
else
it
would
provide
him
with
something
to
think
about
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
it
courteous
was
it
even
right
to
drop
his
friends
without
the
slightest
apology
or
explanation
ought
he
not
as
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
to
go
back
and
bid
them
peter
after
carefully
considering
the
point
discovered
that
it
was
clearly
his
duty
to
perform
this
trifling
act
of
civility
as
soon
as
he
had
settled
that
he
got
out
his
from
the
in
which
he
had
placed
it
for
his
own
security
and
sitting
down
just
as
he
was
drew
another
fifteen
minutes
and
cashed
them
like
the
first
at
the
ormolu
clock
this
time
he
found
himself
sitting
on
a
cushioned
bench
in
the
of
the
it
was
shortly
after
sunset
as
he
could
tell
from
the
bar
of
dusky
crimson
against
the
violet
sea
which
framed
in
the
ports
opposite
rose
and
sank
with
each
roll
of
the
ship
there
was
a
swell
on
and
she
rolled
more
than
he
could
have
wished
as
he
expected
he
was
not
alone
but
as
he
had
expected
his
companion
was
neither
miss
tyrrell
nor
miss
davenport
but
a
grim
and
portly
matron
who
was
eyeing
him
with
a
look
of
strong
disfavour
which
made
peter
wish
he
had
not
come
what
he
wondered
was
he
in
for
now
his
uneasiness
was
increased
as
he
glanced
down
upon
his
trousers
which
being
new
and
of
a
delicate
lavender
tint
reminded
him
that
in
his
impatience
he
had
come
away
in
his
wedding
garments
he
feared
that
he
must
present
rather
an
odd
appearance
on
board
ship
in
this
festal
attire
but
there
he
would
have
to
stay
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
and
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
repeat
tourmalin
said
the
matron
you
are
doubtless
not
unprepared
for
the
fact
that
i
have
requested
a
few
private
conversation
with
you
pardon
me
said
peter
quaking
already
at
this
alarming
opening
but
i
am
very
much
unprepared
surely
he
thought
this
could
not
be
dear
friend
no
that
was
too
absurd
he
must
have
drawn
the
line
then
permit
me
to
enlighten
you
she
said
raspingly
i
sent
for
you
at
a
time
when
we
are
least
likely
to
be
interrupted
to
demand
an
explanation
from
you
upon
a
very
delicate
and
painful
matter
which
has
recently
come
to
my
knowledge
said
peter
and
nothing
more
he
guessed
her
purpose
at
once
she
was
going
to
ask
him
his
intentions
with
regard
to
her
daughter
he
could
have
wished
for
some
indication
as
to
whether
she
was
lady
tyrrell
or
davenport
but
as
he
had
none
at
present
oh
seemed
the
safest
remark
to
make
life
on
board
a
large
tourmalin
she
went
on
to
observe
though
relaxed
in
some
respects
is
still
not
without
decencies
which
a
gentleman
is
bound
to
respect
quite
so
said
peter
unable
to
discover
the
bearings
which
lay
in
the
application
of
this
particular
observation
you
so
but
what
has
your
been
sir
that
said
peter
is
exactly
what
i
should
like
to
know
myself
a
true
gentleman
would
have
considered
the
responsibility
he
incurred
by
giving
currency
to
idle
and
malicious
gossip
his
apprehensions
were
correct
then
it
one
of
the
young
ladies
mothers
but
i
can
only
assure
you
madam
he
began
that
if
unhappily
i
have
er
been
the
means
of
furnishing
gossip
it
has
been
entirely
unintentional
she
seemed
so
much
mollified
by
this
that
he
proceeded
with
more
confidence
as
to
anything
i
may
have
said
to
your
daughter
when
she
almost
bounded
from
her
seat
with
fury
my
sir
do
you
mean
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
you
had
the
audacity
to
so
much
as
hint
of
such
a
thing
to
my
daughter
of
all
people
so
so
much
depends
on
who
your
daughter
is
said
peter
completely
losing
his
head
you
dared
to
strike
this
cruel
and
unmanly
blow
at
the
of
a
sensitive
girl
to
poison
her
defenceless
ears
with
your
false
dastardly
insinuations
and
you
can
actually
admit
it
i
do
know
whether
i
can
admit
it
or
not
yet
he
replied
and
and
you
do
put
things
so
very
strongly
it
is
like
this
if
you
are
referring
to
any
conversation
i
may
have
had
with
miss
tyrrell
tyrrell
you
have
told
her
exclaimed
this
terrible
old
matron
thereby
demonstrating
that
at
least
she
was
not
lady
tyrrell
i
i
have
said
miss
davenport
said
peter
correcting
himself
precipitately
miss
davenport
as
well
upon
my
word
and
pray
sir
may
i
ask
how
many
other
ladies
on
board
this
ship
are
in
possession
of
your
amiable
confidences
he
raised
his
hands
in
utter
despair
i
ca
say
he
groaned
i
do
really
know
what
i
may
have
said
or
whom
i
may
have
said
it
to
i
i
seem
to
have
done
so
much
in
my
spare
time
but
i
never
meant
anything
it
may
be
so
she
said
indeed
you
hardly
seem
to
me
accountable
for
your
actions
or
you
would
not
appear
in
such
a
ridiculous
costume
as
that
with
a
sprig
of
in
your
and
a
high
hat
too
i
quite
feel
said
peter
blushing
that
such
a
costume
must
strike
you
as
inappropriate
but
but
i
happened
to
be
trying
them
on
and
rather
than
keep
you
waiting
well
well
sir
never
mind
your
costume
the
question
is
if
you
are
genuinely
anxious
to
repair
the
wrong
you
have
done
what
course
do
you
propose
to
take
i
will
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
madam
said
peter
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
repair
any
wrong
i
have
done
if
i
done
any
wrong
which
i
do
admit
by
taking
any
course
whatever
you
are
she
cried
and
you
tell
me
so
to
my
face
after
all
reflected
peter
why
should
he
be
afraid
of
this
old
lady
in
a
few
more
minutes
he
would
be
many
hundreds
of
miles
away
and
he
would
take
very
good
care
not
to
come
back
again
he
felt
master
of
the
situation
and
determined
to
brazen
it
out
i
do
madam
he
said
crossing
his
legs
in
an
easy
fashion
look
at
it
from
a
reasonable
point
of
view
there
is
safety
in
numbers
and
if
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
give
several
young
ladies
here
an
entirely
erroneous
impression
i
must
leave
it
to
you
to
undeceive
them
as
considerately
but
distinctly
as
you
can
for
me
to
make
any
selection
would
only
create
among
the
rest
and
their
own
good
sense
will
show
them
that
i
am
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
my
country
which
i
am
the
last
person
to
set
at
defiance
that
i
am
forbidden
even
if
i
were
free
in
other
respects
which
i
am
not
to
marry
them
all
the
only
possible
explanation
of
your
conduct
is
that
you
are
not
in
your
right
mind
she
said
who
in
the
world
spoke
or
dreamed
of
your
marrying
any
one
of
them
certainly
not
oh
said
peter
hopelessly
fogged
once
more
i
thought
i
might
unintentionally
have
given
them
grounds
for
some
such
expectation
i
very
glad
i
was
mistaken
you
see
you
must
really
make
allowances
for
my
utter
ignorance
if
this
idiotic
behaviour
is
not
a
mere
feint
sir
i
can
make
allowances
for
much
but
surely
you
are
at
least
sufficiently
in
your
proper
senses
to
see
how
abominably
you
have
behaved
have
i
said
peter
submissively
i
do
wish
to
contradict
you
if
you
say
so
i
sure
and
as
i
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
my
stay
on
board
this
ship
will
not
last
very
much
longer
i
should
like
before
i
go
to
express
my
very
sincere
regret
there
is
an
easy
way
of
proving
your
sincerity
sir
if
you
choose
to
avail
yourself
of
it
she
said
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
from
the
evident
feebleness
of
your
intellect
that
you
can
be
the
person
chiefly
responsible
for
this
scandal
am
i
correct
in
my
supposition
you
are
madam
said
peter
i
should
never
have
got
myself
into
such
a
tangle
as
this
if
i
had
not
been
talked
over
by
perkins
i
do
know
if
i
can
succeed
in
making
myself
clear
for
the
whole
business
is
rather
complicated
but
i
can
try
to
explain
it
if
you
will
only
have
a
little
patience
you
have
said
quite
enough
she
said
i
know
all
i
wish
to
know
now
so
it
was
perkins
who
has
been
using
you
as
his
instrument
was
it
certainly
said
peter
but
for
him
nothing
of
this
would
have
happened
you
will
have
no
objection
to
repeating
that
statement
should
i
call
upon
you
to
do
so
no
said
peter
who
observed
with
pleasure
that
her
wrath
against
himself
was
almost
entirely
moderated
but
you
will
have
to
call
or
i
shall
have
gone
i
i
do
know
if
i
shall
have
another
opportunity
of
meeting
perkins
but
if
i
did
i
should
certainly
tell
him
that
i
do
consider
he
has
treated
me
quite
fairly
he
has
put
me
in
what
i
may
call
a
false
position
in
false
positions
and
if
i
had
had
the
knowledge
i
have
now
i
should
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
from
the
first
he
entirely
misled
me
over
this
business
very
well
sir
she
said
you
have
shown
a
more
gentlemanly
spirit
on
the
whole
than
i
expected
i
am
glad
to
find
that
your
evil
has
been
wrought
more
by
want
of
thought
than
heart
it
will
be
for
you
to
complete
your
reparation
when
the
proper
time
arrives
in
the
meantime
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
sir
never
to
but
here
peter
made
the
sudden
discovery
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
of
the
but
at
home
in
his
old
by
his
bachelor
fireside
phew
he
muttered
to
himself
that
was
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
while
it
lasted
what
an
old
it
was
but
she
right
it
a
warning
to
me
i
must
i
really
must
draw
any
more
of
these
confounded
time
cheques
i
made
that
ship
too
hot
to
hold
me
already
i
better
remain
for
ever
in
contented
ignorance
of
how
i
spent
that
extra
time
than
go
on
getting
into
one
mess
after
another
like
this
it
was
a
wonder
i
got
out
of
this
one
as
well
as
i
did
but
evidently
that
old
woman
knew
what
perkins
is
and
saw
was
to
blame
now
she
explain
the
whole
affair
to
all
those
girls
whoever
they
may
be
and
pitch
into
perkins
and
serve
him
right
out
of
it
at
any
rate
and
now
thank
goodness
after
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
live
contentedly
and
happily
with
dearest
sophia
i
better
burn
this
beastly
i
shall
never
want
it
again
it
would
have
been
well
for
peter
if
he
had
burnt
that
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
destroy
it
after
all
it
was
an
interesting
of
some
very
curious
if
not
unique
experiences
and
as
such
he
decided
to
preserve
it
chapter
iv
the
fourth
cheque
blue
felicity
in
a
practical
temptation
and
a
the
difficulties
of
being
completely
a
slight
the
avenging
peter
tourmalin
enjoyed
his
honeymoon
extremely
in
a
calm
sober
and
rational
manner
sophia
discouraged
rapture
but
on
the
other
hand
no
one
was
better
fitted
to
inspire
and
sustain
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
wonders
of
geology
and
catching
her
scientific
enthusiasm
peter
spent
many
happy
hours
with
her
along
the
cliffs
searching
for
fossil
remains
in
fact
the
only
cloud
that
threatened
to
mar
their
felicity
at
all
was
an
unfortunate
tendency
on
his
part
to
confuse
a
trilobite
with
a
graptolite
a
blunder
for
which
sophia
had
no
tolerance
he
was
hazy
about
his
periods
too
until
she
sent
up
to
town
for
lyell
great
work
on
the
subject
as
a
birthday
surprise
for
him
and
he
read
it
aloud
to
her
on
the
sands
altogether
it
was
a
peaceful
happy
time
and
never
once
in
the
whole
course
of
his
honeymoon
did
he
seriously
entertain
the
possibility
of
making
any
further
use
of
his
book
of
blank
time
cheques
if
he
had
contemplated
it
no
harm
would
have
been
done
however
as
the
book
was
lying
amongst
his
neglected
papers
at
his
former
chambers
he
felt
no
poignant
regret
when
the
month
came
to
an
end
and
they
returned
to
town
to
take
possession
of
their
marylebone
flat
for
what
was
it
but
shifting
the
scene
of
their
happiness
and
after
this
had
taken
place
peter
was
still
too
much
occupied
to
have
leisure
for
idle
and
mischievous
thoughts
marrying
sophia
was
indeed
like
loving
sir
richard
steele
fair
lady
a
liberal
education
and
peter
enjoyed
the
undivided
benefit
of
her
rare
talent
for
instruction
he
had
been
giving
his
attention
to
astronomy
of
late
an
unguarded
remark
of
his
having
betrayed
to
sophia
the
extreme
crudity
of
his
ideas
respecting
that
science
and
she
had
insisted
upon
his
getting
a
popular
primer
with
diagrams
and
mastering
it
as
a
preliminary
to
deeper
study
one
evening
he
was
in
the
smaller
room
of
the
two
that
divided
by
an
arch
served
for
study
and
combined
and
he
was
busily
engaged
in
working
out
a
simple
practical
illustration
by
the
aid
of
one
of
the
aforesaid
diagrams
the
experiment
required
a
lamp
a
ball
of
cotton
and
an
orange
transfixed
by
a
and
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
succession
of
the
seasons
solar
and
lunar
eclipses
and
the
varying
lengths
of
day
and
night
on
different
portions
of
our
globe
though
he
was
not
very
clear
what
do
you
find
you
understand
the
inclination
of
the
moon
orbit
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
better
now
said
sophia
as
she
came
through
the
arch
i
think
i
shall
as
soon
as
i
can
get
the
moon
to
keep
steadier
he
said
with
more
hope
than
he
felt
and
it
rather
hard
to
remember
whereabouts
i
am
supposed
to
be
on
this
orange
i
must
get
you
something
to
make
that
clearer
she
said
and
you
have
tilted
the
orange
nearly
enough
but
leave
it
for
a
moment
i
brought
you
in
this
packet
of
letters
and
things
the
people
at
your
old
rooms
have
just
sent
down
i
wish
while
i
am
away
i
shall
be
back
in
a
minute
you
would
just
run
over
them
and
tell
me
if
there
are
any
papers
you
want
kept
or
if
they
may
all
be
burnt
while
she
was
gone
he
undid
the
string
which
fastened
the
packet
and
found
at
the
bottom
of
a
mass
of
bills
and
documents
of
no
value
the
small
oblong
which
he
had
vowed
never
to
see
again
somehow
as
his
eyes
rested
on
its
green
cover
the
old
longing
came
upon
him
for
a
complete
change
of
air
and
scene
he
felt
as
if
he
get
away
from
that
orange
there
were
no
lamps
but
electric
lights
and
no
oranges
on
board
the
but
then
his
last
visit
had
not
turned
out
a
success
what
if
he
were
to
find
he
had
drawn
another
quarter
of
an
hour
with
that
irate
matron
of
the
however
he
had
left
her
as
he
remembered
in
a
comparatively
pacific
mood
she
understood
him
better
now
and
besides
thanks
to
the
highly
erratic
system
if
there
was
any
system
on
which
the
payments
were
made
the
chances
were
immensely
against
his
coming
across
the
same
old
lady
twice
running
he
thought
he
would
risk
that
it
was
much
more
likely
that
he
would
meet
miss
tyrrell
or
miss
davenport
or
it
might
even
be
another
person
to
whom
he
was
unconsciously
allied
by
the
bond
of
dear
friendship
the
only
question
was
how
far
he
could
trust
himself
in
such
companionship
but
here
he
felt
himself
guilty
of
a
that
was
unworthy
of
him
if
on
the
two
previous
occasions
he
could
not
call
to
mind
that
he
had
entertained
any
deeper
sentiment
for
either
young
lady
than
a
cordial
and
sympathetic
interest
was
it
likely
that
now
he
was
a
married
man
he
would
be
more
susceptible
he
was
as
devoted
to
his
sophia
as
ever
but
the
wear
and
tear
of
several
successive
evenings
spent
in
elementary
astronomy
were
telling
upon
his
constitution
such
high
thinking
did
not
agree
with
him
he
wanted
a
plainer
mental
diet
for
a
change
fifteen
minutes
spent
in
the
society
of
someone
with
a
mind
rather
less
cultivated
than
his
wife
would
be
very
restful
then
when
he
came
back
he
would
give
his
whole
mind
to
the
orange
again
in
short
all
peter
good
resolutions
were
thrown
overboard
once
more
and
he
wrote
out
a
cheque
for
the
usual
amount
in
desperate
fear
lest
sophia
might
return
before
he
could
get
it
honoured
he
felt
a
certain
compunction
even
then
in
presenting
it
to
the
severe
and
intensely
respectable
black
marble
timepiece
which
recorded
the
flying
hours
of
his
domestic
bliss
he
almost
doubted
whether
it
would
countenance
so
irregular
a
proceeding
but
although
it
was
on
the
verge
of
striking
nine
it
cashed
the
cheque
without
hesitation
it
was
peter
was
sitting
on
a
folding
seat
protected
from
the
scorching
sun
by
the
awning
which
was
stretched
above
and
along
the
exposed
side
of
the
deck
and
to
his
great
satisfaction
he
found
miss
tyrrell
reclining
in
a
between
himself
and
the
railing
and
a
pleasant
picture
of
fresh
and
graceful
girlhood
she
presented
as
usual
he
was
not
in
time
for
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
for
she
was
evidently
commenting
upon
something
he
had
said
how
delightful
it
sounds
she
was
saying
and
what
a
free
unfettered
kind
of
life
yours
must
be
tourmalin
from
your
description
now
this
was
awkward
because
he
must
have
been
giving
her
an
airy
description
of
his
existence
as
the
bachelor
and
butterfly
he
had
ceased
to
be
he
answered
guardedly
awaiting
his
opportunity
to
lead
up
to
a
disclosure
of
the
change
in
his
circumstances
since
they
had
last
met
it
is
pleasant
enough
he
said
a
little
dull
at
times
perhaps
he
added
thinking
of
the
orange
she
laughed
oh
you
must
expect
me
to
pity
you
she
said
i
do
believe
you
need
ever
be
dull
unless
you
choose
there
must
always
be
friends
who
are
glad
to
see
you
i
am
glad
to
think
said
peter
that
when
i
do
feel
dull
i
have
at
least
one
friend
one
dear
friend
from
whom
i
may
count
upon
a
welcome
he
accompanied
this
speech
with
such
a
look
that
she
could
not
well
pretend
to
mistake
his
meaning
and
the
next
moment
he
regretted
it
for
he
saw
he
had
gone
too
far
that
is
a
very
pretty
speech
she
said
with
a
faint
flush
but
is
it
a
little
premature
tourmalin
considering
that
we
have
scarcely
known
one
another
two
days
for
the
moment
peter
had
forgotten
the
want
of
consecutiveness
in
these
eccentric
time
cheques
this
interview
should
by
rights
have
preceded
the
first
he
had
had
with
her
he
felt
annoyed
with
himself
and
still
more
with
the
unbusinesslike
behaviour
of
the
bank
i
i
was
anticipating
perhaps
he
said
but
i
assure
you
that
we
shall
certainly
friends
i
may
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
dear
friends
sooner
or
later
you
see
if
i
am
not
right
miss
tyrrell
smiled
are
you
sure
she
said
with
her
eyes
demurely
lowered
are
you
sure
that
there
is
nobody
who
might
object
to
our
being
on
quite
such
intimate
terms
as
that
peter
started
could
she
possibly
have
guessed
and
how
much
did
she
know
there
could
be
nothing
for
anybody
to
object
to
he
said
are
you
er
referring
to
any
person
in
particular
she
still
kept
her
eyes
down
but
then
she
was
occupied
just
at
the
moment
in
removing
a
loose
splinter
of
bamboo
from
the
arm
of
her
chair
you
must
think
me
curious
or
or
indiscreet
if
i
tell
you
she
said
but
before
i
knew
you
to
speak
to
i
i
could
help
noticing
how
often
as
you
sat
on
deck
you
used
to
pull
something
out
of
your
pocket
and
look
at
it
my
watch
suggested
peter
feeling
uncomfortable
no
not
your
watch
it
looked
more
like
well
like
a
photograph
it
may
have
been
a
photograph
now
you
mention
it
he
admitted
well
miss
tyrrell
well
she
said
i
often
amuse
myself
by
making
up
stories
about
people
i
meet
quite
strangers
i
mean
and
do
you
know
i
made
up
my
mind
that
that
photograph
was
the
portrait
of
someone
some
lady
you
are
engaged
to
i
should
so
much
like
to
know
if
i
was
right
or
not
here
was
peter
opportunity
of
revealing
his
real
status
and
preventing
all
chance
of
future
misunderstanding
it
was
not
too
late
but
still
it
might
be
best
and
kindest
to
break
the
news
gradually
you
were
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
he
said
that
was
the
portrait
of
a
lady
i
was
er
engaged
to
unless
peter
was
very
much
mistaken
there
was
a
new
light
in
her
face
an
added
brightness
in
her
soft
grey
eyes
as
she
raised
them
for
an
instant
before
resuming
her
labours
upon
the
then
you
mean
she
said
softly
that
the
engagement
is
broken
off
peter
began
to
recognise
that
explanation
was
a
less
simple
affair
than
it
had
seemed
if
he
said
that
he
was
no
longer
engaged
but
to
the
original
of
that
photograph
she
would
naturally
want
to
know
why
he
had
just
led
her
to
believe
as
he
must
have
done
that
he
was
still
a
careless
and
unattached
bachelor
she
would
ask
and
he
was
married
and
how
could
he
give
a
straightforward
and
satisfactory
answer
to
such
questions
and
then
another
side
of
the
case
struck
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
undeniably
married
but
would
he
be
strictly
correct
in
describing
himself
as
being
so
this
particular
interview
it
belonged
properly
to
the
time
he
had
made
the
voyage
home
and
he
was
certainly
not
married
in
the
difficulty
he
was
in
he
thought
it
best
to
go
on
telling
the
truth
until
it
became
absolutely
impossible
and
then
fall
back
on
invention
the
fact
is
miss
tyrrell
he
said
that
i
ca
be
absolutely
certain
whether
the
engagement
is
ended
or
not
at
this
precise
moment
her
face
was
alive
with
the
sweetest
sympathy
poor
mr
tourmalin
she
said
how
horribly
anxious
you
must
be
to
get
back
and
know
ah
said
peter
yes
i
i
shall
know
when
i
get
home
i
suppose
and
he
sighed
for
the
orange
recurred
once
more
to
his
reluctant
memory
do
tell
me
if
it
pains
you
too
much
she
said
gently
i
only
ask
because
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
you
do
you
think
that
when
you
do
get
home
you
will
find
her
married
i
have
every
reason
for
believing
so
he
said
that
will
be
a
terrible
blow
for
you
of
course
a
blow
said
peter
forgetting
himself
good
gracious
me
no
why
it
be
i
i
mean
i
shall
be
prepared
for
it
you
know
then
it
not
so
bad
after
all
she
said
it
not
at
all
bad
said
peter
with
a
vague
intention
of
loyalty
to
sophia
i
like
it
i
think
i
understand
she
said
slowly
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
she
has
married
but
she
may
tell
you
that
she
never
had
the
least
intention
of
letting
you
go
so
easily
yes
said
peter
she
may
tell
me
that
certainly
if
she
finds
out
where
i
been
he
added
mentally
and
she
continued
what
would
you
do
then
i
suppose
he
said
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
do
whatever
she
wished
yes
she
agreed
warmly
you
do
that
even
if
it
costs
you
something
wo
you
because
it
will
be
the
only
right
the
only
honourable
course
to
take
you
will
be
the
happier
for
it
in
the
end
tourmalin
i
am
sure
you
will
after
all
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
must
understand
about
the
time
cheques
or
why
should
she
urge
him
to
give
them
up
if
sophia
demanded
such
a
sacrifice
no
i
shall
not
he
said
i
shall
miss
these
times
terribly
you
do
know
what
they
are
to
me
or
you
would
speak
like
that
mr
tourmalin
she
cried
i
i
must
not
listen
to
you
you
possibly
mean
what
you
seem
to
mean
it
is
wrong
wrong
to
me
and
wrong
to
her
to
say
things
that
that
for
all
you
know
you
are
not
free
to
say
do
let
me
think
badly
of
you
peter
was
absolutely
horrified
what
had
he
said
to
agitate
her
like
that
he
had
merely
meant
to
express
the
pleasure
he
found
in
these
brief
and
stolen
visits
to
the
and
she
had
misconstrued
him
like
this
at
all
hazards
he
must
explain
now
if
it
took
him
days
to
make
it
clear
my
dear
miss
tyrrell
he
protested
earnestly
you
quite
misunderstood
me
you
did
indeed
pray
be
calm
and
i
will
endeavour
to
make
my
position
a
little
clearer
than
i
afraid
i
have
done
the
worst
of
it
is
he
added
that
the
whole
thing
has
got
into
such
a
muddle
that
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
exactly
make
out
what
my
position
is
at
the
present
moment
you
can
if
you
will
only
recollect
that
you
are
this
said
a
familiar
voice
and
with
the
abruptness
characteristic
of
the
time
cheque
system
he
was
back
in
his
study
staring
at
the
ground
glass
globe
of
the
lamp
and
the
transfixed
orange
the
clock
behind
him
was
striking
nine
and
sophia
was
offering
him
a
pin
with
a
big
black
head
oh
am
i
the
he
repeated
helplessly
really
peter
said
sophia
i
think
the
pin
just
at
this
moment
has
the
more
intelligent
expression
of
the
two
do
try
to
look
a
little
less
idiotic
now
see
you
stick
the
pin
into
the
orange
to
represent
your
point
of
view
and
then
keep
on
twirling
it
slowly
round
so
peter
twirled
the
orange
slowly
round
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
though
his
thoughts
were
far
away
with
miss
tyrrell
he
was
wondering
what
she
could
have
thought
of
him
and
worse
still
what
she
would
think
if
she
could
see
him
as
he
was
employed
at
that
moment
i
tell
you
what
we
must
do
peter
when
you
get
a
little
more
advanced
said
sophia
enthusiastically
that
evening
we
must
see
if
we
ca
pick
up
a
small
secondhand
orrery
somewhere
it
would
be
so
nice
to
have
one
oh
delightful
he
said
absently
he
was
not
very
clear
as
to
what
an
orrery
was
unless
it
was
the
dusty
machine
that
was
worked
with
handles
at
sundry
lectures
he
had
attended
in
early
youth
but
of
one
thing
he
felt
grimly
certain
that
it
was
something
which
would
render
it
necessary
to
draw
more
time
cheques
chapter
periodic
drawings
series
of
cheques
their
advantages
and
an
unknown
uncompleted
ibsen
with
a
a
from
confidence
whether
it
was
natural
sin
on
peter
part
or
an
excusable
spirit
of
revolt
against
the
oppression
of
an
orrery
which
sophia
succeeded
in
picking
up
a
great
bargain
at
an
auction
somewhere
his
drafts
on
the
joint
stock
time
bank
limited
did
not
end
with
the
one
recorded
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
which
was
more
discreditable
still
he
no
longer
pretended
to
himself
that
he
meant
to
stop
until
his
balance
was
completely
exhausted
his
only
care
now
was
to
economise
to
regulate
his
expenditure
by
spreading
his
drawings
over
as
long
a
period
as
possible
with
this
object
he
made
a
careful
calculation
and
found
there
were
still
several
hours
to
his
credit
whereupon
lest
he
should
yield
to
the
temptation
of
drawing
too
much
at
any
one
time
he
made
out
a
number
of
cheques
for
fifteen
minutes
apiece
and
limited
himself
to
one
a
week
an
allowance
which
even
under
the
severest
provocation
he
rarely
permitted
himself
to
exceed
these
weekly
excursions
short
as
they
were
were
a
source
of
the
greatest
comfort
to
him
especially
now
that
he
had
thrown
off
any
idea
of
moral
responsibility
by
degrees
he
possessed
himself
of
most
of
the
if
they
may
be
so
termed
of
his
dual
romance
at
one
time
he
found
himself
being
presented
by
the
grateful
sir
william
to
his
daughter
and
now
that
he
knew
what
service
he
had
rendered
the
judge
he
was
less
at
sea
than
he
would
certainly
have
been
otherwise
another
time
he
discovered
himself
in
the
act
of
dragging
miss
davenport
unceremoniously
back
from
the
bulwarks
but
here
again
his
memory
furnished
him
with
the
proper
excuse
for
conduct
which
considering
that
he
was
not
supposed
to
be
acquainted
with
her
he
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
account
for
satisfactorily
so
after
all
there
did
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
method
in
the
operation
of
the
time
cheques
arbitrary
as
it
appeared
one
fact
that
went
far
to
reconcile
him
to
his
own
conscience
was
the
circumstance
that
though
the
relations
he
stood
in
towards
both
young
ladies
varied
at
each
interview
with
the
most
bewildering
uncertainty
so
that
one
week
he
would
be
upon
the
closest
and
most
confidential
terms
and
the
next
be
thrown
back
into
the
conventional
formality
of
a
first
introduction
these
relations
never
again
approached
the
dangerous
level
of
sentiment
which
had
so
alarmed
him
he
flattered
himself
that
the
judicious
attitude
he
was
adopting
to
both
was
correcting
the
false
impressions
which
might
have
and
for
that
matter
actually
had
been
given
he
was
always
pleased
to
see
them
again
whichever
one
it
was
they
were
simply
charming
friends
frank
natural
unaffected
girls
and
not
too
clever
sometimes
indeed
he
recognised
and
did
his
best
to
discourage
symptoms
of
a
dawning
tenderness
on
their
part
which
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
reciprocate
peter
was
in
no
danger
of
losing
his
heart
to
either
possibly
the
attractions
of
each
served
as
a
conductor
to
protect
him
from
the
influence
of
the
other
he
enjoyed
their
society
their
evident
appreciation
of
all
he
said
and
did
but
that
was
all
and
as
they
recognised
that
there
could
be
no
closer
bond
than
that
of
cordial
friendship
between
them
he
was
relieved
of
all
misgivings
surely
it
was
a
blameless
and
legitimate
manner
even
for
a
married
man
of
spending
the
idle
moments
which
belonged
properly
to
the
days
of
his
bachelorhood
still
he
did
not
confide
this
harmless
secret
of
his
to
sophia
he
might
tell
her
when
it
was
all
over
but
not
so
long
as
her
disapproval
could
affect
his
plans
and
he
had
an
instinct
that
such
a
story
as
he
had
to
tell
would
fail
to
appeal
to
a
person
of
her
accurately
logical
habit
of
mind
so
on
one
occasion
when
he
discovered
that
he
had
lost
one
of
the
loose
cheques
he
now
carried
constantly
about
with
him
it
was
with
a
feeling
very
like
panic
that
he
reflected
that
he
might
have
dropped
it
about
the
house
where
its
unusual
form
would
inevitably
provoke
sophia
curiosity
and
he
was
much
reassured
when
he
was
able
to
conclude
from
the
fact
that
she
made
no
reference
to
it
that
he
must
have
lost
it
out
of
doors
it
must
have
been
some
time
after
this
before
his
serenity
again
met
with
a
slight
shock
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
deck
with
miss
davenport
it
happened
to
be
one
of
the
days
when
he
knew
her
very
well
indeed
sometimes
she
was
saying
i
feel
as
if
i
speak
to
somebody
you
know
where
you
will
always
find
a
very
willing
listener
he
said
with
a
kind
of
fatherly
floweriness
that
he
felt
sat
well
upon
him
i
did
mean
you
she
said
to
some
girl
of
my
own
age
i
meant
oh
said
peter
well
that
a
very
natural
feeling
i
sure
i
can
quite
understand
it
then
you
would
mind
you
would
be
angry
if
i
did
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
her
great
childishly
serious
eyes
my
dear
child
said
peter
getting
more
fatherly
every
moment
how
could
i
possibly
object
to
your
speaking
to
any
lady
on
board
if
you
want
to
he
would
have
liked
to
make
one
or
two
exceptions
perhaps
but
he
thought
he
had
better
not
i
am
so
glad
she
said
because
i
did
this
very
morning
i
did
so
want
someone
to
advise
me
to
tell
me
what
a
girl
ought
to
do
what
she
would
do
herself
in
my
place
ah
said
peter
sympathetically
it
is
er
a
difficult
position
for
you
no
doubt
and
for
you
too
she
said
quickly
remember
that
and
for
me
of
course
said
peter
assenting
as
he
always
did
now
from
habit
to
anything
he
did
not
understand
at
the
moment
my
position
might
be
described
as
one
of
er
difficulty
certainly
and
so
you
asked
advice
about
yours
eh
i
could
very
well
help
myself
she
said
there
was
a
girl
a
little
older
than
i
am
perhaps
sitting
next
to
me
on
deck
and
she
mentioned
your
name
and
somehow
i
hardly
know
how
it
came
about
but
she
seemed
so
kind
and
so
interested
in
it
all
that
that
i
believe
i
told
her
everything
you
are
with
me
are
you
peter
she
had
been
making
a
of
miss
tyrrell
it
was
awkward
extremely
awkward
and
annoying
if
as
he
began
to
fear
her
confidences
were
of
a
tender
character
i
i
am
not
exactly
angry
he
said
but
i
do
think
you
might
be
more
careful
whom
you
speak
to
what
did
you
tell
her
she
said
with
the
same
little
quiver
in
her
underlip
he
had
noticed
before
that
is
no
answer
said
peter
it
certainly
was
none
for
him
tell
me
you
said
i
i
told
her
about
you
and
about
me
and
and
about
oh
said
peter
about
me
and
you
and
him
well
and
and
how
did
she
it
she
did
say
very
much
she
turned
very
pale
it
was
rather
rough
at
the
time
and
i
do
think
she
can
be
a
very
good
sailor
for
before
i
had
even
finished
she
got
up
and
went
below
and
i
have
seen
her
since
but
you
told
her
about
he
persisted
and
when
you
say
i
presume
you
refer
to
here
he
paused
expectantly
of
course
she
answered
with
a
touch
of
impatience
whom
else
should
i
be
to
refer
to
it
excessively
absurd
said
peter
driven
to
candour
at
last
i
i
remember
perfectly
that
you
did
mention
all
the
circumstances
at
the
time
but
i
a
shocking
memory
for
names
and
just
for
the
minute
i
i
find
it
difficult
to
recall
where
comes
in
exactly
curious
is
it
curious
she
said
passionately
it
it
is
agreed
peter
i
quite
admit
that
i
to
know
only
i
this
is
cruel
unmanly
she
said
brokenly
how
you
forget
how
can
you
insult
me
by
that
you
could
forget
such
a
thing
as
that
it
is
odious
of
you
to
make
a
a
joke
of
it
all
when
you
know
perfectly
well
that
my
my
dear
young
lady
he
declared
as
she
left
her
speech
unfinished
i
am
as
far
from
any
disposition
to
be
jocular
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
let
me
beg
you
to
be
a
little
more
explicit
we
seem
to
have
got
into
a
trifling
misunderstanding
which
i
am
sure
a
little
patience
will
easily
put
right
put
right
said
sophia
behind
him
i
was
not
aware
peter
that
the
clock
was
out
of
order
what
is
the
matter
with
it
he
almost
staggered
back
from
the
chimneypiece
upon
which
he
had
found
himself
leaning
in
an
attitude
of
earnest
persuasion
i
i
was
only
thinking
my
love
he
said
that
it
wanted
regulating
if
it
does
said
sophia
you
are
hardly
the
proper
person
to
do
it
peter
the
less
you
meddle
with
it
the
better
i
should
think
perhaps
so
my
dear
sophia
perhaps
so
said
peter
sitting
down
with
the
utmost
docility
he
had
narrowly
escaped
exciting
suspicion
it
was
fortunate
that
there
was
nothing
compromising
in
the
few
words
she
had
overheard
but
he
must
not
allow
himself
to
be
caught
so
near
the
clock
again
he
was
not
a
little
disturbed
by
the
tenor
of
this
last
interview
it
was
bad
enough
that
in
some
way
he
seemed
to
have
seriously
displeased
miss
davenport
but
besides
that
he
could
not
contemplate
without
uneasiness
the
probable
effect
which
her
confidences
whatever
their
exact
purport
might
have
upon
miss
tyrrell
for
hitherto
he
had
seen
no
necessity
to
mention
to
one
young
lady
that
he
was
even
distantly
acquainted
with
the
other
as
he
never
by
any
chance
drew
them
both
together
there
seemed
no
object
in
volunteering
such
information
but
this
only
made
him
more
apprehensive
of
a
scene
when
his
next
turn
with
miss
tyrrell
arrived
perhaps
he
thought
it
would
be
wiser
to
keep
away
from
the
for
a
week
or
two
and
give
them
all
time
to
calm
down
a
little
however
he
had
the
moral
or
rather
the
immoral
courage
to
present
a
cheque
as
usual
at
the
end
of
the
next
week
with
results
that
were
even
less
in
accordance
with
his
anticipations
than
before
it
came
about
in
this
way
he
was
comfortably
seated
by
the
fireplace
opposite
sophia
in
a
cosy
domesticated
fashion
and
was
reading
to
her
aloud
for
he
had
been
let
off
the
orrery
that
evening
the
book
he
was
reading
by
sophia
particular
request
was
ibsen
and
it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
subject
which
interested
her
deeply
but
of
peter
elocution
which
was
poor
that
on
glancing
from
the
text
he
found
that
she
had
sunk
into
a
profound
and
peaceful
slumber
it
was
a
chance
he
had
been
waiting
for
all
day
he
was
rather
tired
of
nora
with
her
innocence
and
her
macaroons
her
tarantella
and
her
taradiddles
her
forgery
and
her
fancy
dress
and
he
had
the
cheque
by
him
in
readiness
so
he
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
mantelpiece
slipped
the
paper
under
the
clock
and
was
just
in
time
to
sink
back
into
his
before
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
in
the
on
the
there
was
a
tumbler
of
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
he
was
sitting
in
close
confabulation
with
his
former
acquaintance
perkins
the
bank
manager
that
precisely
what
i
do
know
sir
and
what
i
determined
to
find
out
were
the
first
words
he
heard
from
the
latter
gentleman
who
looked
flushed
and
angry
but
it
a
scandalous
thing
is
it
very
said
peter
rather
bored
and
deeply
disappointed
for
the
manager
was
but
an
indifferent
substitute
for
the
companion
he
had
been
counting
upon
oh
very
have
you
happened
to
hear
anything
said
about
it
yourself
inquired
his
friend
not
a
word
said
peter
with
the
veracity
he
always
endeavoured
to
maintain
on
these
occasions
to
go
and
shift
a
statement
of
that
kind
on
to
my
shoulders
like
that
it
like
the
fellow
confounded
impudence
for
the
moment
peter
felt
a
twinge
could
the
other
be
referring
to
anything
he
had
said
himself
in
the
but
the
manager
was
evidently
not
angry
with
so
it
must
be
some
other
fellow
only
peter
decided
not
to
allude
to
the
faulty
working
of
the
time
cheques
as
he
had
to
do
perkins
was
not
in
the
mood
for
remonstrances
just
then
most
impudent
i
must
say
he
replied
he
added
carelessly
what
was
the
statement
exactly
why
god
bless
my
soul
sir
cried
the
manager
with
unnecessary
vehemence
have
i
been
telling
you
the
whole
story
you
just
ask
me
who
the
fellow
was
who
has
brought
me
into
this
business
so
i
did
said
peter
and
and
who
he
your
attention
seems
very
wandering
this
evening
why
i
told
you
the
old
woman
would
give
me
his
name
peter
alarm
returned
at
this
allusion
to
an
old
woman
what
old
woman
could
it
be
but
the
terrible
matron
whom
he
had
encountered
in
the
however
it
was
fortunate
that
she
had
not
mentioned
any
names
if
perkins
knew
that
he
had
put
all
the
blame
of
his
entanglements
upon
the
manager
broad
shoulders
he
would
certainly
consider
it
an
ungrateful
return
for
what
was
intended
as
a
kindness
so
you
said
before
he
remarked
some
old
women
are
so
obstinate
obstinate
that
the
first
sensible
remark
you
made
for
a
long
while
said
his
candid
friend
i
should
think
she
was
obstinate
why
i
talked
myself
hoarse
trying
to
make
that
old
harridan
believe
that
i
was
as
innocent
as
an
unborn
babe
of
any
responsibility
for
this
precious
scandal
that
i
never
so
much
as
heard
it
breathed
till
she
told
me
of
it
but
it
was
any
good
sir
she
would
have
it
that
i
was
the
originator
so
you
were
thought
peter
though
he
prudently
refrained
from
saying
so
she
going
to
kick
up
the
dooce
own
delight
as
soon
as
she
meets
her
brother
and
all
i
could
get
her
to
say
was
that
then
and
not
till
then
she
would
give
me
an
opportunity
of
having
it
out
with
the
cowardly
villain
whoever
he
may
be
that
has
dared
to
lay
all
this
gossip
at
door
peter
did
not
quarrel
with
this
arrangement
of
the
old
lady
for
he
would
certainly
not
be
on
board
the
when
she
arrived
at
plymouth
ah
he
said
with
as
much
interest
as
he
could
display
in
a
subject
that
did
not
concern
him
he
find
that
unpleasant
i
daresay
i
think
he
will
said
perkins
emphatically
unless
he
retracts
his
infamous
calumny
i
i
kick
him
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
involuntarily
peter
eyes
sought
his
friend
boots
which
as
he
sat
in
a
corner
seat
with
his
feet
extended
were
much
in
evidence
they
were
strong
suitable
boots
stouter
than
those
generally
worn
on
a
and
peter
could
not
repress
a
slight
shudder
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
he
repeated
that
rather
a
long
way
quite
long
enough
for
him
though
not
nearly
long
enough
for
me
said
the
manager
i
teach
him
to
mix
me
up
in
these
squabbles
when
i
find
him
sir
when
i
find
him
here
steward
bring
some
more
of
these
dry
biscuits
you
have
some
more
wo
you
but
peter
was
not
in
the
vein
for
dry
biscuits
at
that
moment
and
the
manager
continued
might
help
me
in
this
if
you
only
will
i
want
to
find
out
if
i
can
before
we
reach
gib
who
this
fellow
is
but
the
less
i
talk
about
the
affair
the
better
oh
yes
said
peter
i
i
would
talk
about
it
at
all
if
i
were
you
no
i
daresay
you
right
ca
be
too
careful
with
an
old
cat
like
that
well
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
try
and
find
out
quietly
you
know
who
this
infernal
fellow
is
well
i
daresay
i
could
do
that
said
peter
no
one
would
think
a
mild
little
chap
like
you
had
any
particular
motive
for
asking
you
might
ask
some
of
the
men
in
the
and
pick
up
some
clue
or
other
so
i
might
said
peter
good
idea
or
i
tell
you
what
you
might
pump
the
old
lady
for
me
eh
i
do
think
i
quite
care
about
pumping
the
old
lady
said
peter
but
anything
else
i
do
with
pleasure
thanks
said
the
manager
that
a
good
fellow
i
knew
i
could
depend
upon
you
you
can
replied
peter
though
i
fancy
he
added
soothingly
indeed
i
am
sure
you
will
find
that
the
old
woman
has
made
a
good
deal
out
of
nothing
at
all
old
woman
peter
asked
sophia
with
drowsy
asperity
not
linden
surely
linden
was
that
the
name
of
the
old
of
the
why
of
course
not
he
was
in
his
by
his
own
fire
reading
ibsen
to
his
wife
i
do
know
indeed
my
love
it
be
linden
he
answered
cautiously
nonsense
said
sophia
crossly
she
not
meant
to
be
old
in
the
play
and
says
old
woman
has
made
a
good
deal
out
of
nothing
helmer
or
doctor
rank
or
krogstad
or
who
you
do
read
so
badly
it
quite
impossible
to
make
out
one
says
it
my
dear
sophia
at
least
it
not
in
my
edition
of
the
text
you
you
must
have
imagined
it
i
think
i
certainly
thought
i
heard
you
read
it
out
she
replied
but
your
voice
is
so
monotonous
that
it
just
possible
i
dropped
off
for
a
minute
or
two
i
dropped
off
myself
about
the
same
time
he
confessed
hypocritically
you
would
drop
off
or
allow
me
to
drop
off
either
peter
said
sophia
who
was
now
thoroughly
awake
again
if
you
felt
a
more
intelligent
interest
in
the
tremendous
problem
ibsen
has
set
in
this
play
i
do
believe
you
realise
in
the
least
what
the
lesson
is
that
he
means
to
teach
now
you
peter
well
i
not
sure
that
i
do
altogether
my
love
he
admitted
i
thought
as
much
what
ibsen
insists
upon
is
the
absolute
necessity
of
between
man
and
wife
peter
they
must
belong
to
each
other
complete
each
other
they
must
be
twin
souls
are
a
twin
soul
peter
upon
my
word
my
dear
i
ca
say
he
replied
in
some
perplexity
in
the
present
very
divided
state
of
his
sympathies
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
his
soul
was
more
like
a
triplet
but
think
persisted
sophia
earnestly
have
you
shared
all
your
past
with
me
is
there
nothing
you
have
kept
back
no
feelings
no
experiences
which
you
confine
to
your
own
bosom
when
you
left
me
to
take
that
voyage
you
promised
that
nothing
should
induce
you
to
be
more
than
civil
to
any
woman
however
young
and
attractive
with
whom
fate
might
bring
you
in
contact
i
want
you
to
tell
me
peter
whether
when
you
were
returning
home
on
board
the
you
kept
that
promise
or
not
fortunately
for
him
she
put
her
question
in
a
form
which
made
it
easy
to
give
a
satisfactory
and
a
truthful
answer
when
i
was
returning
home
on
board
the
he
said
i
did
not
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
and
belief
exchange
two
words
with
any
female
whatever
attractive
or
otherwise
until
he
added
with
a
timely
recollection
that
she
had
come
on
board
at
gibraltar
until
i
met
you
you
pain
me
with
these
suspicions
sophia
you
do
indeed
i
believe
you
peter
she
said
moved
by
his
sincerity
which
paradoxical
as
it
may
sound
was
quite
real
for
his
intentions
had
been
so
excellent
throughout
that
he
felt
injured
by
her
doubts
you
have
never
told
me
a
falsehood
yet
but
for
some
time
i
have
been
tormented
by
a
fancy
that
you
were
concealing
something
from
me
i
can
hardly
say
what
gave
me
such
an
impression
a
glance
a
tone
trifles
which
i
am
glad
to
think
now
had
not
the
importance
i
invested
them
with
ah
peter
never
treat
me
as
helmer
did
nora
never
shut
me
out
from
the
serious
side
of
your
life
and
think
to
make
amends
by
calling
me
your
lark
or
your
you
must
not
look
upon
me
as
a
mere
doll
my
sophia
he
exclaimed
i
should
never
think
of
addressing
you
as
either
a
squirrel
or
a
lark
and
anyone
less
like
a
doll
in
every
respect
i
never
met
i
hope
you
will
always
think
so
peter
she
said
for
i
tell
you
frankly
that
if
i
once
discovered
that
you
had
ceased
to
trust
me
that
you
lived
in
a
world
apart
into
which
i
was
not
admitted
that
very
moment
peter
i
should
act
just
as
nora
did
i
should
leave
you
for
our
marriage
would
have
ceased
to
be
one
in
any
true
sense
of
the
word
the
mere
idea
of
being
abandoned
by
sophia
made
him
shiver
what
a
risk
he
had
been
running
after
all
was
it
worth
while
to
peril
his
domestic
happiness
for
the
sake
of
a
few
more
conversations
with
two
young
ladies
whose
remarks
were
mostly
enigmatic
and
for
whom
he
was
conscious
in
his
heart
of
hearts
of
not
caring
two
straws
sophia
he
said
plaintively
do
talk
of
leaving
me
what
should
i
do
without
you
who
would
teach
me
astronomy
and
things
you
know
i
do
care
for
anybody
but
you
why
will
you
dwell
on
such
unpleasant
subjects
i
was
wrong
peter
she
confessed
indeed
i
doubt
you
no
longer
it
was
all
my
morbid
imagination
that
led
me
to
do
you
such
injustice
forgive
me
and
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
i
do
forgive
you
was
his
generous
reply
to
this
appeal
which
coming
from
sophia
was
a
very
handsome
apology
and
we
say
no
more
about
it
and
upon
the
whole
peter
thought
he
had
got
out
of
a
particularly
tight
place
with
more
credit
than
he
had
any
reason
to
expect
a
conclusion
in
which
the
reader
however
much
he
or
she
may
disapprove
of
his
conduct
on
moral
grounds
will
probably
be
inclined
to
agree
with
him
chapter
vi
foil
and
counterfoil
duties
of
peter
continued
perversity
and
its
unforeseen

the

it
would
be
more
satisfactory

author

especially
when
he
is
aware
that
he
will
be
held
accountable
by
an
indignant
public
for
the
slightest
deviation
on
his
hero
part
from
the
narrow
path
of
ideal
rectitude
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
to
be
able
to
record
that
this
latest
warning
had
a
permanent
effect
upon
peter
tourmalin
rather
shifty
disposition
but
an
author
even
of
a
modest
performance
such
as
this
can
not
but
feel
himself
in
a
position
of
grave
responsibility
he
must
relate
such
facts
as
he
has
been
able
to
collect
without
suppression
on
the
one
side
or
distortion
on
the
other
it
is
a
duty
he
can
not
and
dare
not
evade
under
penalty
of
forfeiting
the
confidence
of
his
readers
peter
tourmalin
draw
more
time
cheques
he
go
back
to
the
and
it
would
be
useless
to
assert
the
contrary
we
may
be
able
to
rehabilitate
him
to
some
extent
before
this
story
concludes
at
present
we
can
only
follow
his
career
with
pain
and
disapproval
some
allowances
must
be
made
for
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
case
to
a
person
of
peter
natural
inclination
to
the
study
of
psychology
there
was
a
strong
fascination
in
watching
the
gradual
unfolding
and
revelation
of
two
characters
so
opposite
and
so
interesting
as
those
of
miss
tyrrell
and
miss
davenport
that
was
the
point
of
view
he
took
himself
and
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
such
a
plea
is
wholly
without
plausibility
then
too
he
was
intensely
curious
to
know
how
it
would
all
end
and
he
might
ascertain
that
in
the
very
next
quarter
of
an
hour
he
drew
there
was
absolutely
no
telling
as
for
sophia
threat
that
soon
lost
all
terrors
for
him
she
would
abandon
him
no
doubt
if
she
ever
knew
but
who
was
going
to
tell
her
and
how
could
she
possibly
discover
the
truth
unaided
especially
now
that
her
awakening
suspicions
had
been
lulled
his
secret
was
perfectly
safe
and
he
could
unravel
the
tangled
thread
of
the
history
of
his
remaining
extra
hours
on
board
the
without
any
other
hindrance
than
that
of
his
own
scruples
which
practically
amounted
to
no
hindrance
at
all
so
peter
continued
to
be
the
slave
of
his
clock
and
his
from
the
counterfoils
of
which
he
was
disagreeably
surprised
to
discover
that
he
had
drawn
more
frequently
and
in
consequence
had
an
even
smaller
balance
left
to
his
credit
than
he
had
supposed
however
he
consoled
himself
by
concluding
that
one
or
two
cheques
had
probably
been
mislaid
and
were
still
unpresented
while
he
was
entitled
to
some
additional
time
in
respect
of
compound
interest
so
that
he
need
not
stint
himself
at
present
fifteen
minutes
a
week
was
not
an
extravagant
allowance
and
sooner
or
later
even
with
the
utmost
economy
a
day
would
come
when
his
balance
would
be
exhausted
and
his
cheques
returned
from
the
clock
marked
no
effects
refer
to
drawer
or
some
equivalent
intimation
but
that
day
was
still
distant
and
in
the
meantime
he
went
on
drawing
with
a
light
heart
it
was
a
saturday
evening
the
day
on
which
peter
generally
presented
his
weekly
cheque
but
although
it
was
nearly
ten
he
had
had
no
opportunity
of
doing
so
as
yet
he
was
in
the
and
sophia
was
reading
aloud
to
him
this
time
an
article
on
from
one
of
the
reviews
for
she
had
been
an
ardent
from
early
girlhood
and
she
naturally
wished
to
win
peter
from
his
laodicean
apathy
on
so
momentous
a
subject
he
listened
with
surface
resignation
although
inwardly
he
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
to
get
back
upon
the
where
miss
davenport
had
been
more
interesting
than
usual
on
his
last
visit
but
he
could
hardly
rise
and
slip
a
cheque
under
the
clock
before
sophia
very
eyes
without
inventing
some
decent
pretext
for
such
an
action
and
had
reduced
him
to
a
mental
condition
which
was
no
longer
fertile
in
expedients
suddenly
sophia
stopped
reading
and
remarked
if
i
remember
right
professor
dibbs
has
stated
the
argument
more
correctly
in
his
little
book
on
it
would
be
interesting
to
compare
the
two
i
get
it
as
professor
dibbs
work
was
apparently
on
a
shelf
in
the
study
sophia
took
the
lamp
into
the
further
room
now
my
time
thought
peter
as
he
brought
out
the
cheque
from
his
i
may
get
such
another
chance
this
evening
even
if
sophia
could
lay
her
hand
on
the
volume
at
once
he
would
have
had
his
quarter
of
an
hour
and
be
comfortably
back
long
before
she
could
pass
the
arch
which
separated
the
two
rooms
for
as
we
have
seen
this
instantaneous
action
was
one
of
the
chief
recommendations
of
the
time
cheques
so
he
cashed
his
cheque
and
was
at
once
transported
to
the
secluded
passage
between
the
the
identical
place
where
he
had
first
conversed
with
miss
davenport
he
was
on
the
same
too
and
she
was
at
his
side
the
wind
carried
the
faint
strains
of
a
set
of
lancers
to
them
from
all
of
which
circumstances
he
drew
the
inference
that
he
was
going
to
be
favoured
with
the
sequel
to
the
conversation
that
had
been
so
incongruously
broken
in
upon
by
sophia
question
respecting
the
comparative
merits
of
in
the
tottenham
court
road
warehouse
this
was
so
far
satisfactory
indicating
as
it
did
that
he
was
at
last
after
so
much
trying
back
to
make
some
real
progress
what
i
want
to
know
first
miss
davenport
was
saying
is
whether
you
are
capable
of
facing
danger
for
my
sake
i
thought
he
remonstrated
mildly
that
i
had
already
given
proof
of
that
the
danger
you
faced
then
threatened
only
me
but
supposing
you
had
to
meet
a
danger
to
yourself
could
you
be
firm
and
cool
much
will
depend
on
that
i
i
think
he
answered
frankly
that
perhaps
you
had
better
not
count
upon
me
i
have
never
been
a
man
to
court
danger
it
might
find
me
equal
to
it
if
it
came
or
it
might
not
he
did
not
mean
to
give
it
the
opportunity
then
we
are
lost
that
is
all
she
said
with
gloomy
conviction
lost
both
of
us
peter
certainly
intended
to
be
lost
if
the
moment
of
trial
ever
arrived
even
now
he
was
resolving
for
about
the
twentieth
time
that
this
positively
should
be
his
very
last
cheque
for
he
by
no
means
liked
the
manner
in
which
the
situation
seemed
to
be
developing
but
seeing
that
the
danger
whatever
it
might
be
was
still
far
enough
off
he
thought
very
sensibly
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
cloud
this
last
interview
by
any
confession
of
pusillanimity
knowing
that
he
would
return
no
more
he
could
surely
afford
to
treat
with
contempt
any
consequences
his
imprudence
might
have
entailed
so
he
laughed
as
he
said
you
must
conclude
that
i
am
a
coward
because
i
do
care
to
boast
on
the
contrary
i
believe
i
am
not
exactly
deficient
in
physical
courage
you
are
not
she
cried
relieved
then
then
you
would
not
be
afraid
to
face
a
desperate
man
not
a
dozen
desperate
men
if
it
comes
to
that
said
peter
supported
by
the
certainty
that
it
would
not
come
to
so
much
as
half
a
desperate
man
then
i
can
tell
you
what
i
have
scarcely
dared
to
think
of
before
peter
you
will
have
to
reckon
with
alfred
well
i
not
much
alarmed
at
anything
may
do
said
peter
wondering
who
the
deuce
alfred
was
he
will
come
on
board
he
will
demand
an
explanation
he
will
insist
on
seeing
you
she
cried
him
said
peter
you
are
brave
braver
even
than
i
thought
but
ah
peter
you
do
know
what
alfred
is
peter
did
not
even
know
who
alfred
was
but
he
was
unmoved
you
leave
alfred
to
me
he
said
confidently
i
settle
but
i
must
tell
you
all
i
i
led
you
to
believe
that
alfred
would
raise
no
objections
that
he
would
quietly
accept
facts
which
it
is
useless
to
contend
against
he
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
he
is
a
man
of
violent
passions
fierce
and
relentless
when
wronged
in
the
first
burst
of
fury
at
meeting
you
when
he
comes
on
board
he
is
capable
of
some
terrible
vengeance
which
nothing
but
perfect
coolness
on
your
part
perhaps
not
even
that
will
be
able
to
avert
and
i
i
have
brought
this
upon
you
do
cry
said
peter
you
see
i
perfectly
calm
mind
it
if
alfred
considers
himself
wronged
by
me
though
what
i
have
ever
done
to
give
him
any
reason
for
revenging
himself
by
personal
violence
i
must
say
i
ca
conceive
she
stopped
him
ah
you
have
given
him
cause
enough
she
cried
what
is
the
use
of
taking
that
tone
to
me
i
want
to
see
alfred
point
of
view
that
all
said
peter
what
does
he
complain
of
does
he
complain
of
you
ask
me
that
when
peter
she
broke
off
suddenly
there
is
somebody
round
the
corner
listening
to
us
a
woman
i
sure
of
it
i
heard
the
rustle
of
a
dress
go
and
see
if
there
is
not
go
and
see
and
find
himself
face
to
face
with
miss
tyrrell
who
might
faint
or
go
into
hysterics
peter
knew
better
than
that
it
merely
your
fancy
he
said
soothingly
who
can
be
there
they
are
all
at
the
other
end
of
the
ship
dancing
go
on
telling
me
about
alfred
i
do
yet
understand
how
i
have
managed
to
offend
him
are
you
really
so
dull
she
said
with
a
slight
touch
of
temper
that
you
ca
see
that
a
man
who
thought
he
was
going
to
meet
the
woman
he
was
engaged
to
and
finds
she
has
learnt
to
care
for
for
somebody
else
is
likely
even
if
he
was
the
mildest
man
in
the
world
which
alfred
is
far
from
being
to
betray
some
annoyance
no
i
see
that
said
peter
but
but
he
ca
blame
me
could
help
it
he
said
this
although
her
last
speech
had
opened
his
eyes
considerably
he
knew
now
who
alfred
was
and
also
that
in
some
moment
of
madness
which
was
in
one
of
the
quarters
of
an
hour
he
had
not
yet
drawn
he
must
have
placed
himself
in
the
position
of
alfred
rival
what
was
he
to
do
he
could
not
without
brutality
tell
this
poor
girl
that
he
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
depriving
alfred
of
her
affections
it
was
better
and
easier
too
to
humour
her
for
the
short
time
that
remained
alfred
will
not
take
that
as
an
excuse
she
said
it
is
true
we
could
neither
of
us
help
what
has
happened
but
that
will
not
alter
the
fact
that
he
is
quite
capable
of
shooting
us
both
the
instant
he
comes
on
deck
alfred
is
like
that
well
said
peter
unable
to
abstain
from
a
little
more
of
such
very
cheap
heroism
i
do
not
fear
death
with
you
say
that
once
more
she
said
which
peter
very
obligingly
did
oh
peter
how
i
admire
you
now
how
little
i
knew
you
were
capable
of
going
so
calmly
to
your
doom
you
give
me
courage
i
feel
that
i
too
can
face
death
only
not
death
it
is
so
horrid
to
be
shot
it
would
be
unpleasant
said
peter
placidly
but
soon
over
no
she
said
i
could
bear
it
i
can
see
him
pointing
his
revolver
for
he
always
carries
one
even
at
a
picnic
first
at
head
then
mine
no
peter
since
we
must
die
i
prefer
at
least
to
do
so
without
bloodshed
so
do
i
he
agreed
very
much
you
do
she
cried
then
oh
peter
why
should
we
wait
any
longer
for
a
fate
that
is
inevitable
let
us
do
it
now
together
do
said
peter
slip
over
the
side
together
it
would
be
quite
easy
no
one
will
see
us
let
us
plunge
into
the
merciful
sea
a
little
struggle
a
moment
battle
for
breath
then
all
will
be
over
yes
i
suppose
it
be
over
then
he
said
but
we
should
have
to
swallow
such
a
lot
of
salt
water
first
he
reflected
that
even
if
he
emerged
from
the
agonies
of
drowning
to
find
himself
with
sophia
the
experience
would
be
none
the
less
unpleasant
while
it
lasted
there
really
must
be
some
limit
to
his
complaisance
and
he
set
it
at
suicide
no
he
said
at
last
i
have
always
held
that
to
escape
a
difficulty
by
putting
an
end
to
one
own
life
is
a
cowardly
proceeding
i
a
coward
she
said
but
oh
peter
be
a
coward
with
me
for
once
ask
me
anything
else
he
said
firmly
but
not
to
stoop
to
cowardice
there
is
really
no
necessity
for
it
you
see
he
added
feeling
that
he
had
better
speak
out
plainly
i
have
no
doubt
that
alfred
will
listen
to
reason
and
when
he
is
told
that
although
as
is
excusable
enough
with
two
natures
that
have
much
in
common
we
we
have
found
a
mutual
pleasure
in
each
society
there
has
been
nothing
on
either
side
inconsistent
with
the
the
most
ordinary
friendship
when
he
hears
that
where
are
you
going
for
she
was
rising
from
her
chair
where
am
i
going
she
replied
with
an
unsteady
laugh
why
overboard
if
you
care
to
know
but
you
must
he
cried
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
the
the
captain
would
like
it
there
a
penalty
i
sure
for
leaving
the
ship
while
it
in
motion
i
seen
it
on
a
notice
there
is
a
penalty
for
having
believed
in
you
she
replied
bitterly
and
i
am
going
to
pay
it
she
broke
away
and
rushed
out
upon
the
deck
into
the
starlight
with
peter
in
pursuit
here
was
a
nice
result
of
his
philandering
he
thought
bitterly
and
yet
what
had
he
done
how
could
he
help
the
consequences
of
follies
committed
in
time
he
had
not
even
spent
yet
however
what
he
had
to
do
now
was
to
prevent
miss
davenport
from
leaping
overboard
at
any
cost
he
would
even
promise
to
jump
over
with
her
if
that
would
soothe
her
and
of
course
he
could
appoint
some
time
next
day
say
after
breakfast
for
the
performance
he
ran
down
the
shadowy
deck
until
he
overtook
a
flying
female
form
whose
hand
he
seized
as
she
crouched
against
the
bulwarks
miss
davenport
if
you
will
only
just
he
began
when
without
warning
he
found
himself
back
upon
his
own
holding
sophia
firmly
by
the
wrist
he
felt
confused
as
well
he
might
but
he
tried
to
pass
it
off
did
you
find
dibbs
my
dear
he
inquired
with
a
ghastly
smile
as
he
dropped
her
hand
i
did
not
said
sophia
gravely
i
was
otherwise
engaged
peter
what
have
you
been
doing
what
have
i
been
doing
he
said
why
it
not
a
minute
since
you
went
into
the
study
to
get
that
book
look
at
the
clock
and
see
do
appeal
to
the
clock
peter
answer
my
question
how
have
you
been
occupied
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
finish
that
article
on
he
had
the
hardihood
to
say
deuced
article
it
is
too
so
clear
i
do
refer
to
what
you
were
doing
here
said
sophia
what
were
you
doing
on
board
the
it
it
so
long
ago
that
i
really
forget
he
said
i
i
read
buckle
on
deck
and
i
talked
with
a
man
named
perkins
nice
fellow
he
was
manager
of
a
bank
out
in
australia
it
useless
to
prevaricate
peter
she
said
what
i
want
to
know
is
who
was
that
girl
and
why
should
she
attempt
to
destroy
herself
he
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
girl
he
stammered
how
do
you
know
that
any
girl
attempted
anything
of
that
sort
how
do
i
know
peter
said
sophia
i
will
tell
you
how
i
know
was
on
board
the
too
at
this
awful
piece
of
intelligence
peter
dropped
into
his
speechless
and
quaking
what
would
come
next
he
could
not
tell
but
anything
seemed
possible
and
even
probable
after
that
chapter
vii
the
culminating
cheque
gives
an
explanation
and
requests
her
peter
before
i
say
anything
else
said
sophia
who
was
still
standing
upon
the
gazing
down
upon
the
wretched
peter
as
he
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
you
would
probably
like
to
know
how
i
came
to
follow
you
to
that
steamer
it
is
a
long
story
but
i
will
tell
you
if
you
wish
to
hear
peter
lips
moved
without
producing
any
articulate
sounds
and
sophia
proceeded
some
weeks
ago
she
said
one
afternoon
when
you
had
gone
out
for
a
walk
i
found
what
seemed
to
be
a
loose
cheque
on
the
carpet
i
knew
how
carelessly
you
leave
things
about
and
i
picked
it
up
and
found
that
though
it
was
like
a
cheque
in
other
respects
it
was
rather
curiously
worded
i
could
not
understand
it
at
all
but
it
seemed
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
steamer
you
came
home
from
australia
in
so
intending
to
ask
you
for
an
explanation
when
you
came
in
i
thought
in
the
meantime
i
would
put
it
in
some
safe
place
where
i
should
be
sure
to
see
it
and
i
put
it
behind
the
clock
and
then
oh
peter
peter
understood
the
cheques
were
all
payable
to
self
or
bearer
sophia
had
innocently
presented
one
and
it
had
been
paid
if
he
had
only
taken
order
cheques
this
would
not
have
happened
but
it
was
too
late
now
he
continued
to
imitate
the
tactics
of
that
eminent
strategist
brer
rabbit
in
other
words
he
lay
low
and
said
nuffin
while
sophia
continued
then
without
in
the
least
knowing
how
i
came
there
i
found
i
was
on
a
big
steamer
and
as
i
walked
along
perfectly
bewildered
i
saw
the
name
painted
on
some
and
of
course
i
knew
then
that
that
was
your
steamer
i
fancied
that
perhaps
in
some
way
you
might
be
on
board
too
and
would
explain
how
this
had
happened
to
me
at
all
events
i
decided
to
find
out
if
you
were
and
seeing
a
girl
reading
on
deck
i
took
a
chair
near
her
and
after
a
few
introductory
remarks
i
mentioned
your
name
the
effect
upon
her
was
such
as
to
convince
me
that
she
felt
more
than
an
ordinary
interest
in
you
by
degrees
i
drew
from
her
the
whole
story
of
her
relations
with
you
she
even
asked
me
for
advice
so
miss
davenport
had
not
been
miss
tyrrell
after
all
but
sophia
if
he
had
only
known
that
before
i
could
not
speak
to
her
continued
sophia
i
felt
stifled
stupefied
by
what
i
had
heard
i
could
bear
no
more
and
so
i
rose
and
left
her
and
walked
down
some
stairs
and
somehow
found
myself
back
in
our
own
room
again
i
was
more
bewildered
than
ever
i
looked
for
the
cheque
but
there
was
nothing
and
soon
i
was
forced
to
believe
that
the
whole
thing
was
imaginary
still
i
was
not
wholly
satisfied
you
may
remember
how
i
questioned
you
one
evening
when
you
were
reading
the
to
me
well
your
answers
quite
reassured
me
for
the
time
i
told
myself
that
my
suspicions
were
too
wildly
improbable
not
to
have
been
a
delusion
i
was
even
afraid
that
my
brain
must
be
slightly
affected
for
i
had
always
prided
myself
upon
having
my
imagination
under
thorough
control
but
by
degrees
peter
by
degrees
i
began
to
doubt
again
whether
it
was
really
nothing
but
fancy
on
my
part
i
noticed
that
your
manner
was
suspiciously
odd
at
times
i
discovered
that
there
was
one
drawer
in
your
secretary
that
you
kept
carefully
locked
i
caught
your
eye
wandering
towards
the
clock
from
time
to
time
i
suspected
i
hardly
know
but
i
felt
certain
that
i
should
find
the
explanation
of
that
mystery
in
the
locked
drawer
i
tried
key
after
key
until
i
found
one
that
fitted
oh
i
am
not
at
all
ashamed
of
it
had
i
not
a
to
know
there
were
no
letters
nothing
but
a
but
that
proved
to
me
that
after
all
i
had
imagined
nothing
all
the
cheques
were
the
same
as
the
one
i
found
on
the
carpet
i
tore
one
out
and
kept
it
by
me
and
from
that
time
i
watched
you
closely
i
saw
how
restless
and
impatient
you
were
this
evening
and
i
was
certain
that
you
were
intending
to
use
a
cheque
from
that
book
you
were
bent
on
getting
back
to
the
and
i
was
equally
determined
that
if
i
could
help
it
you
should
not
go
alone
only
i
could
not
be
quite
sure
how
you
managed
to
get
there
and
at
last
i
hit
upon
a
little
device
for
finding
out
there
is
no
such
person
as
professor
dibbs
peter
i
invented
him
to
put
you
off
your
guard
as
i
passed
into
the
other
room
with
the
lamp
i
saw
you
reflected
in
the
mirror
over
the
study
chimneypiece
rise
and
go
to
the
mantelpiece
you
had
a
slip
of
paper
in
your
hand
a
cheque
of
course
i
had
the
cheque
i
tore
out
hidden
in
the
waistband
of
my
dress
and
so
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
slip
your
cheque
behind
the
clock
in
the
i
put
cheque
behind
the
one
in
the
study
i
was
on
the
deck
at
once
and
it
was
dark
but
i
could
hear
your
voice
and
another
round
a
corner
i
held
my
breath
and
listened
what
i
heard
you
know
peter
shrank
up
in
his
chair
utterly
confounded
by
this
last
vagary
on
the
part
of
the
time
cheques
he
certainly
would
not
have
supposed
that
the
mere
presentation
even
of
a
bearer
cheque
by
sophia
would
entitle
her
to
the
same
fifteen
minutes
he
was
receiving
himself
he
could
only
account
for
it
by
the
fact
that
the
two
cheques
were
cashed
simultaneously
at
two
separate
clocks
but
even
this
explanation
was
not
wholly
satisfactory
he
found
his
voice
at
last
well
he
said
now
that
you
know
all
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
sophia
i
i
would
rather
know
the
worst
i
will
tell
you
that
in
good
time
she
replied
but
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
tell
me
exactly
how
you
came
to
have
these
cheques
and
what
use
you
made
of
them
on
previous
occasions
so
slightly
reassured
by
her
manner
which
was
composed
peter
gave
her
a
plain
unvarnished
account
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
led
to
deposit
his
extra
time
and
the
whole
story
of
his
interviews
with
miss
davenport
he
did
not
mention
any
others
because
he
felt
that
the
affair
was
quite
complicated
enough
without
dragging
in
extraneous
and
irrelevant
matter
i
may
have
been
imprudent
he
concluded
but
i
do
assure
you
sophia
that
in
all
the
quarters
of
an
hour
i
have
had
as
yet
i
never
once
behaved
to
that
young
lady
in
any
capacity
but
that
of
a
friend
i
only
went
on
drawing
the
cheques
because
i
wanted
a
little
change
of
air
and
scene
now
and
then
you
have
no
idea
how
it
picked
me
up
i
saw
in
what
society
it
set
you
down
peter
was
chilling
answer
you
you
must
think
she
is
like
that
he
urged
it
took
me
quite
by
surprise
it
was
a
most
painful
position
for
me
i
think
sophia
your
own
sense
of
fairness
will
acknowledge
that
considering
the
awkwardness
of
my
situation
i
i
behaved
as
well
as
could
be
expected
you
do
admit
that
do
you
sophia
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
so
before
she
spoke
again
i
must
have
time
to
think
peter
she
said
it
is
all
so
strange
so
contrary
to
all
my
experience
that
i
can
hardly
see
things
as
yet
in
their
proper
light
but
i
may
tell
you
at
once
that
from
what
i
was
able
to
observe
and
from
all
you
have
just
told
me
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
you
are
free
from
actual
culpability
in
the
matter
it
was
quite
clear
that
that
very
forward
girl
was
the
principal
throughout
and
that
you
were
nothing
more
than
an
unwilling
and
most
embarrassed
accessory
this
was
so
much
more
lenient
a
view
than
he
had
dared
to
expect
that
peter
recovered
his
ordinary
equanimity
that
was
all
he
said
i
am
very
glad
you
saw
it
my
dear
i
was
perfectly
helpless
and
then
said
sophia
i
was
more
than
pleased
by
your
firm
refusal
to
commit
suicide
what
you
said
was
so
very
sound
and
true
peter
i
hope
so
said
peter
with
much
complacency
yes
i
was
pretty
firm
with
her
by
the
way
he
added
you
you
did
happen
to
see
whether
she
really
did
jump
overboard
i
suppose
i
came
away
just
at
the
crisis
she
said
i
thought
you
would
tell
came
away
too
said
peter
it
does
matter
of
course
but
still
i
should
have
rather
liked
to
know
whether
she
meant
it
or
not
how
can
you
speak
of
it
so
heartlessly
peter
she
may
have
been
trying
to
frighten
you
she
is
just
the
kind
of
girl
who
would
but
she
may
have
been
in
earnest
after
all
you
see
sophia
said
peter
it
does
matter
whether
she
was
or
not
it
is
as
if
it
had
ever
really
happened
not
really
happened
but
i
was
i
heard
i
saw
it
nothing
could
be
more
real
at
any
rate
he
said
it
only
happens
when
i
use
those
cheques
and
she
ca
possibly
carry
out
her
rash
intention
until
i
draw
another
which
i
promise
you
faithfully
i
will
never
do
if
you
doubt
me
i
will
burn
the
book
now
before
your
eyes
with
these
words
he
went
to
the
drawer
and
took
out
the
no
said
sophia
you
must
not
do
that
peter
there
is
much
about
this
time
bank
that
i
do
pretend
to
understand
that
i
can
not
account
for
by
any
known
natural
law
but
i
may
not
disbelieve
my
own
eyes
and
ears
these
events
that
have
happened
in
the
extra
time
you
chose
to
defer
till
now
are
just
as
real
as
any
other
events
you
made
this
girl
acquaintance
you
have
i
do
say
through
any
fault
of
your
own
but
still
you
caused
her
to
transfer
her
affections
from
the
man
she
was
engaged
to
and
being
a
creature
of
mind
and
no
strength
of
character
she
has
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
her
life
rather
than
meet
his
just
indignation
she
is
now
on
the
very
point
of
accomplishing
this
folly
well
badly
as
she
has
behaved
you
can
not
possibly
leave
the
wretched
girl
there
you
must
go
back
at
once
restrain
her
by
main
force
and
not
leave
her
until
you
have
argued
her
into
a
rational
frame
of
mind
peter
was
by
no
means
anxious
to
go
back
at
first
it
not
at
all
necessary
he
said
and
besides
i
do
know
if
you
aware
of
it
but
with
the
way
these
cheques
are
worked
it
ten
chances
to
one
against
my
hitting
off
the
right
fifteen
minutes
still
he
added
with
an
afterthought
i
can
of
course
if
you
insist
upon
it
i
can
take
my
chance
with
another
fifteen
minutes
but
that
must
be
the
last
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
this
business
i
am
indeed
shameful
as
it
is
to
state
he
had
altered
his
mind
from
a
sudden
recollection
that
he
would
not
mind
seeing
miss
tyrrell
for
just
once
more
he
had
not
drawn
her
for
several
weeks
no
said
sophia
thoughtfully
i
see
your
objection
fifteen
minutes
is
not
enough
unless
you
could
be
sure
of
getting
the
successors
to
the
last
but
i
have
an
idea
peter
if
you
draw
out
the
whole
balance
of
your
time
you
ca
possibly
help
getting
the
right
fifteen
minutes
somewhere
or
other
i
think
that
logical
oh
devilish
logical
muttered
peter
to
himself
who
had
reasons
which
he
could
not
divulge
to
her
for
strongly
disapproving
of
such
a
plan
the
fact
is
my
dear
he
said
it
it
rather
late
this
evening
to
go
away
for
any
time
you
forget
she
said
that
however
long
you
are
away
you
will
come
back
at
exactly
the
same
time
you
started
but
you
have
some
other
reason
peter
you
had
better
tell
me
well
he
owned
i
might
come
across
someone
i
rather
not
meet
you
are
thinking
of
the
man
that
girl
said
she
had
been
engaged
to
alfred
was
it
peter
had
forgotten
alfred
for
the
moment
and
besides
he
was
not
likely
to
turn
up
till
the
got
to
plymouth
and
he
knew
his
extra
hours
stopped
before
that
still
alfred
did
very
well
as
an
excuse
ah
he
said
alfred
you
heard
what
she
said
about
him
a
violent
character
with
a
revolver
sophia
but
you
told
her
you
were
not
afraid
of
him
i
felt
so
proud
of
you
when
you
said
it
and
think
you
may
be
able
to
bring
them
together
to
heal
the
breach
between
them
he
more
likely
to
make
a
breach
in
me
that
wo
heal
said
peter
still
as
you
said
yourself
it
is
as
if
it
was
all
actually
existing
what
does
it
matter
even
if
he
should
shoot
you
i
do
see
any
advantage
in
exposing
myself
to
any
such
unpleasant
experiences
even
if
they
are
only
temporary
he
said
it
is
not
a
question
of
advantage
peter
rejoined
sophia
it
is
a
simple
duty
and
i
surprised
that
you
do
see
it
as
such
whatever
the
consequences
of
your
conduct
may
be
you
can
not
evade
them
like
this
you
have
chosen
to
begin
and
you
must
go
on
i
am
quite
clear
about
that
let
me
see
here
she
took
the
and
made
some
rapid
calculations
from
the
counterfoils
yes
you
have
two
hours
and
at
least
still
standing
to
your
credit
and
then
there
the
compound
interest
i
will
tear
out
all
these
small
cheques
and
burn
them
which
she
did
as
she
spoke
and
now
peter
sit
down
and
fill
up
one
of
the
blank
ones
at
the
end
for
the
whole
amount
do
you
know
sophia
said
peter
it
occurs
to
me
that
this
is
just
one
of
those
matters
which
can
only
be
satisfactorily
arranged
by
er
a
woman
tact
suppose
i
make
the
cheque
payable
to
now
eh
you
mean
that
you
want
me
to
go
instead
of
you
she
asked
well
said
peter
if
it
would
be
bothering
you
my
dear
i
think
perhaps
it
be
do
say
another
word
she
interrupted
or
i
shall
begin
to
you
peter
if
i
thought
you
meant
it
seriously
i
would
go
upstairs
put
on
my
bonnet
and
go
back
to
mamma
for
ever
i
could
not
bear
to
be
the
wife
of
a
coward
oh
i
go
said
peter
in
much
alarm
i
said
what
i
did
out
of
consideration
not
cowardice
but
would
do
as
well
sophia
it
is
late
to
turn
out
will
do
as
well
she
said
fill
up
that
cheque
or
you
will
lose
me
for
ever
there
said
peter
as
he
scrawled
off
the
cheque
are
you
satisfied
sophia
i
shall
be
when
i
see
you
present
it
er
yes
he
said
oh
i
mean
to
present
it
presently
i
i
think
i
take
a
small
glass
of
brandy
before
i
go
my
dear
to
keep
the
cold
out
as
you
will
certainly
be
in
a
summer
if
not
tropical
temperature
the
next
moment
she
said
i
should
advise
you
to
take
nothing
of
the
kind
i
say
he
suggested
suppose
i
find
she
has
just
jumped
overboard
what
shall
i
do
then
do
can
you
possibly
ask
you
will
jump
after
her
of
course
it
easy
to
say
course
he
said
but
i
never
swim
more
than
twenty
strokes
swim
those
twenty
then
and
let
come
what
will
you
will
be
back
all
the
sooner
but
do
stand
there
talking
about
it
peter
go
i
going
he
said
meekly
you
sit
up
for
me
sophia
if
if
i
late
wo
you
do
be
absurd
she
said
you
know
perfectly
well
that
as
i
said
before
you
wo
be
away
a
second
it
wo
be
a
second
for
you
he
said
but
it
will
be
several
hours
for
and
goodness
only
knows
what
i
may
have
to
go
through
in
the
time
however
he
added
with
an
attempt
to
be
cheerful
it
may
all
pass
off
quite
pleasantly
do
you
think
it
may
sophia
how
i
tell
you
will
only
find
out
by
going
i
going
my
dear
i
going
at
once
you
give
me
just
one
kiss
before
i
start
wo
you
i
will
give
you
no
kiss
till
you
come
back
and
i
hear
what
you
have
done
said
sophia
very
well
he
retorted
you
may
be
sorry
you
refused
when
too
late
i
may
never
come
back
at
all
for
anything
i
can
tell
and
little
as
he
knew
it
he
spoke
with
an
almost
prophetic
anticipation
of
what
was
to
come
never
again
was
he
destined
to
stand
on
that
but
he
dared
not
linger
longer
as
he
could
see
from
her
expression
that
she
would
suffer
no
further
trifling
and
he
slipped
his
last
cheque
under
the
clock
with
consequences
that
must
be
reserved
for
the
next
chapter
chapter
viii
paid
in
his
own
coin
suspense
a
gleam
of
darkness
the
rock
sir
william
lends
his
reappearance
of
an
old
a
new
out
of
the
peter
found
himself
below
this
time
in
the
broad
passage
furnished
with
seats
and
tables
for
writing
which
divided
the
passengers
cabins
above
he
heard
a
confused
stir
and
bustle
of
excitement
the
trampling
of
feet
the
creaking
and
rattle
of
chains
orders
shouted
in
english
and
hindustani
from
the
absence
of
all
vibration
in
the
vessel
it
was
evident
that
she
had
been
brought
to
peter
guessed
the
cause
only
too
easily
the
unhappy
miss
davenport
had
indeed
succeeded
in
carrying
out
her
rash
design
she
had
jumped
overboard
and
the
captain
had
stopped
the
engines
and
lowered
a
boat
in
the
hope
of
picking
her
up
before
she
sank
and
he
himself
why
was
he
skulking
below
like
this
he
had
only
too
much
reason
to
fear
that
he
must
have
been
a
witness
of
the
fatal
leap
and
instead
of
plunging
overboard
to
the
rescue
as
a
hero
ought
had
rushed
down
here
ignominiously
had
he
been
observed
was
his
connection
with
the
tragedy
suspected
could
he
venture
up
on
deck
and
inform
himself
he
tried
but
his
nerve
failed
him
and
he
sank
into
one
of
the
chairs
in
a
state
of
almost
unbearable
suspense
just
at
this
moment
he
saw
the
skirts
of
a
muslin
gown
appear
at
the
head
of
the
broad
companion
which
led
to
the
someone
a
girl
evidently
was
descending
presently
he
saw
her
fully
revealed
it
was
miss
tyrrell
perhaps
he
had
never
been
so
glad
to
see
her
before
she
was
a
friend
a
dear
friend
she
at
least
would
sympathise
with
him
would
understand
that
it
was
not
his
fault
if
he
had
been
too
late
to
avert
a
catastrophe
she
was
coming
to
him
her
eyes
were
friendly
and
pitiful
as
they
sought
his
she
at
least
did
not
turn
from
him
how
pale
how
terribly
pale
you
look
she
said
you
must
nerve
yourself
to
see
her
it
can
not
be
long
now
has
she
been
brought
on
board
yet
he
gasped
is
is
there
any
hope
we
shall
know
very
soon
it
is
possible
you
may
find
that
all
is
at
an
end
ah
you
think
so
but
but
no
one
will
say
it
was
fault
will
they
i
i
was
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
only
somehow
when
the
moment
comes
i
am
apt
to
lose
my
presence
of
mind
yes
i
know
she
said
feelingly
you
are
not
quite
yourself
yet
but
i
know
you
would
make
the
sacrifice
if
your
duty
demanded
it
but
she
may
have
taken
advantage
of
your
absence
to
free
herself
and
you
from
all
obligation
may
she
not
this
suggestion
comforted
peter
she
have
done
he
said
yes
of
course
i
could
not
be
expected
to
prevent
it
if
i
was
there
and
i
was
when
it
came
to
the
point
but
miss
tyrrell
do
you
think
that
it
is
really
all
over
she
she
may
come
round
after
all
she
may
but
of
course
if
it
is
true
that
she
is
engaged
to
another
she
can
have
no
possible
claim
on
what
a
sensible
way
this
girl
had
of
looking
at
things
thought
peter
not
for
the
first
time
why
of
course
she
ca
he
cried
and
it
true
she
is
engaged
to
a
fellow
of
the
name
of
alfred
you
know
that
as
a
fact
she
exclaimed
i
know
it
from
her
own
lips
and
i
need
not
say
that
i
should
be
the
last
person
to
wish
to
er
upset
so
desirable
an
arrangement
why
did
you
tell
me
all
this
before
she
inquired
i
i
did
think
it
would
interest
you
he
replied
here
to
peter
utter
astonishment
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
not
interest
me
she
murmured
at
last
oh
how
could
you
how
you
keep
this
from
me
ca
you
see
ca
you
guess
what
a
difference
it
has
made
in
my
feelings
it
might
be
very
dull
of
him
but
he
could
perceive
why
the
fact
of
miss
davenport
engagement
to
alfred
should
affect
miss
tyrrell
so
strangely
as
this
i
may
call
you
now
she
said
oh
peter
happy
you
have
made
me
why
did
you
keep
silence
so
long
it
was
too
quixotic
do
you
understand
even
yet
no
said
peter
blankly
i
afraid
i
do
then
if
you
are
really
so
diffident
i
i
must
tell
you
that
if
you
were
to
ask
a
certain
question
once
more
i
might
i
do
say
i
should
but
i
might
meet
it
with
a
different
answer
good
heavens
he
ejaculated
involuntarily
but
you
must
not
ask
me
yet
not
just
yet
i
must
have
time
to
consider
i
must
tell
papa
before
i
decide
anything
you
wait
a
little
longer
wo
you
peter
yes
he
said
feeling
limp
i
wait
i
rather
she
smiled
radiantly
upon
him
and
then
fled
lightly
up
the
companion
leaving
him
with
fresh
cause
for
uneasiness
he
could
no
longer
doubt
that
for
some
reason
she
expected
him
to
propose
to
her
which
it
seemed
he
had
already
in
one
of
those
confounded
extra
minutes
been
unprincipled
enough
to
do
now
she
had
gone
to
inform
her
father
the
judge
and
he
would
have
the
disagreeable
task
of
disabusing
them
before
long
at
this
point
he
started
believing
that
he
was
visited
by
an
apparition
for
a
opened
and
miss
davenport
came
out
and
stood
before
him
but
she
was
so
obviously
flesh
and
blood
and
so
dry
that
he
soon
saw
that
all
his
anxiety
on
her
account
had
been
superfluous
then
you
you
did
jump
overboard
after
all
he
faltered
divided
between
relief
and
annoyance
at
having
been
made
to
come
back
as
it
were
on
false
pretences
you
know
who
prevented
me
and
by
what
arguments
she
said
in
a
low
strained
voice
i
he
said
helplessly
who
should
if
you
do
not
did
not
you
implore
me
not
to
leave
you
and
declare
that
if
i
would
only
have
courage
and
wait
we
should
be
happy
even
yet
and
i
wait
for
what
i
ask
you
peter
tourmalin
for
it
really
no
use
asking
he
said
for
i
no
idea
i
waited
to
discover
that
all
this
time
you
have
had
a
secret
understanding
with
another
that
you
are
about
to
transfer
your
fickle
affections
to
to
that
fair
girl
do
deny
it
peter
i
was
listening
i
see
it
all
all
i
wish
to
goodness
did
he
said
i
never
was
in
such
a
muddle
as
this
in
my
life
i
can
only
assure
you
that
if
that
young
lady
really
imagines
that
i
am
or
can
be
anything
more
to
her
than
a
friend
she
is
entirely
mistaken
i
was
just
about
to
go
up
and
explain
as
much
to
her
father
you
are
not
deceiving
me
she
asked
earnestly
you
are
i
will
swear
it
if
you
wish
he
replied
no
she
said
relenting
visibly
your
word
is
enough
i
do
believe
you
and
i
am
almost
happy
again
so
long
as
you
do
not
desert
me
even
alfred
loses
half
his
terrors
exactly
he
said
and
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
just
run
up
on
deck
and
settle
this
other
business
he
went
up
to
the
and
found
the
ship
had
anchored
in
front
was
a
huge
barren
rock
with
lines
of
forts
walls
and
telegraph
poles
and
at
its
base
a
small
white
town
huddled
they
had
arrived
at
gibraltar
which
accounted
for
the
absence
of
motion
as
he
stood
there
taking
this
in
he
was
accosted
by
sir
william
tyrrell
who
thrust
his
arm
through
peter
in
a
friendly
manner
my
dear
boy
said
the
judge
heartily
violet
has
just
told
me
the
good
news
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
delighted
most
delighted
i
have
always
felt
a
warm
interest
in
you
ever
since
that
affair
of
of
the
monkey
said
peter
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
sir
william
but
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
am
afraid
miss
tyrrell
was
a
little
premature
she
misinterpreted
a
remark
of
mine
which
in
point
of
fact
referred
to
somebody
else
altogether
then
you
have
no
more
reason
than
before
for
assuming
that
your
has
thrown
you
over
am
i
to
understand
that
no
more
reason
than
before
admitted
peter
and
your
uncertainty
still
continues
very
unsatisfactory
i
must
say
i
do
think
my
dear
fellow
that
in
your
position
you
should
have
been
more
careful
to
refrain
from
betraying
any
interest
in
violet
until
you
knew
that
you
were
free
to
speak
as
it
is
you
may
have
cast
a
shadow
upon
her
young
life
that
it
will
take
years
to
dispel
peter
heart
sank
into
his
boots
for
very
shame
at
this
gentle
and
almost
paternal
reproof
yes
continued
the
worthy
judge
violet
is
a
girl
scrupulously
sensitive
on
points
of
honour
and
unless
the
young
lady
you
are
under
a
to
should
release
you
of
her
own
free
will
i
know
my
daughter
too
well
to
doubt
that
she
will
counsel
you
to
fulfil
your
contract
and
renounce
all
hope
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
peter
felt
a
little
easier
i
i
am
prepared
to
do
that
he
said
well
i
do
say
myself
that
i
go
quite
so
far
as
she
does
but
strictly
no
doubt
a
promise
is
a
promise
and
should
be
kept
at
all
hazards
you
have
done
all
that
a
man
can
honourably
do
to
put
himself
right
you
have
written
to
this
young
lady
so
i
understand
informing
her
of
the
change
in
your
sentiments
and
offering
nevertheless
to
redeem
your
promise
if
she
insisted
upon
it
i
think
that
was
the
general
purport
of
your
letter
here
was
one
more
evil
fruit
of
his
extra
time
what
would
sophia
think
or
say
or
do
if
such
a
letter
as
that
ever
came
to
her
knowledge
fortunately
that
at
least
was
impossible
you
have
some
grounds
the
judge
went
on
for
assuming
that
the
lady
has
already
treated
the
contract
as
a
person
called
alfred
i
think
my
daughter
said
no
that
was
a
mistake
explained
peter
alfred
is
engaged
to
quite
a
different
person
well
in
any
case
it
is
quite
possible
that
you
may
obtain
your
release
when
you
meet
her
and
your
suspense
will
soon
be
over
now
miss
er
pincher
is
it
will
probably
be
on
board
the
ship
before
many
minutes
i
see
the
boats
are
putting
out
from
the
harbour
already
cried
peter
with
the
terrible
conviction
darting
through
his
mind
that
sir
william
spoke
the
bare
truth
sophia
had
said
something
about
meeting
him
at
gibraltar
but
if
she
had
done
so
during
the
real
voyage
how
could
he
have
the
meeting
all
over
again
with
this
ghastly
variation
if
he
could
only
remember
whether
she
had
come
out
or
not
it
was
singular
incomprehensible
but
his
memory
was
a
blank
on
such
a
vital
fact
as
this
would
you
like
to
have
my
for
a
moment
said
sir
william
considerately
peter
took
it
and
the
next
moment
the
binocular
fell
from
his
nerveless
hands
he
had
seen
only
too
clearly
the
familiar
form
of
sophia
seated
in
the
peaked
stern
of
a
small
craft
which
a
spanish
boatman
was
scissoring
through
the
waves
towards
the
come
courage
said
the
judge
kindly
as
he
picked
up
his
glass
and
wiped
the
lenses
do
be
nervous
my
boy
you
do
know
what
she
may
have
to
say
to
you
yet
you
know
no
i
do
he
groaned
i
i
think
i
ought
to
go
down
to
the
gangway
and
meet
her
he
added
tremulously
not
that
he
had
any
intention
of
doing
so
but
he
wanted
to
be
alone
before
the
judge
could
even
express
his
approbation
of
course
tourmalin
was
down
on
the
seeking
a
quiet
spot
wherein
to
collect
his
thoughts
before
he
could
find
the
quiet
spot
however
he
almost
ran
into
the
arms
of
the
matron
from
melbourne
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
the
episode
of
the
a
word
with
you
mr
tourmalin
she
said
i
i
really
ca
stop
now
stammered
peter
i
i
expecting
friends
i
too
she
said
am
expecting
a
relation
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
now
my
brother
who
has
been
staying
at
gibraltar
on
account
of
his
health
will
be
as
determined
as
i
am
to
trace
and
punish
the
infamous
calumny
upon
the
name
and
career
of
our
honoured
parent
i
daresay
madam
said
peter
i
daresay
very
creditable
to
you
both
but
i
really
ca
stop
just
now
you
appear
to
forget
sir
that
unless
you
can
satisfactorily
establish
your
innocence
my
brother
will
certainly
treat
you
as
the
person
primarily
responsible
for
an
atrocious
slander
a
slander
upon
your
father
said
the
indignant
peter
why
i
never
of
the
gentleman
denial
will
not
serve
you
now
she
said
i
have
not
only
your
own
admissions
in
the
but
the
evidence
of
more
than
one
trustworthy
witness
to
prove
that
you
circulated
a
report
that
my
dear
father
one
of
the
most
honoured
and
respected
citizens
of
melbourne
began
his
colonial
career
as
as
a
transported
convict
after
all
as
the
hapless
peter
instantly
saw
he
have
said
so
for
anything
he
knew
in
one
of
those
still
unexhausted
extra
quarters
of
an
hour
if
i
said
so
i
was
misinformed
he
said
just
so
and
in
our
conversation
on
the
subject
you
mentioned
the
name
of
the
person
who
used
you
as
his
mouthpiece
to
disseminate
his
malicious
venom
what
i
wish
to
know
now
is
whether
you
are
prepared
or
not
to
repeat
that
statement
peter
recollected
now
that
he
had
used
expressions
implicating
perkins
although
merely
as
the
origin
of
totally
different
complications
i
ca
positively
go
so
far
as
that
he
said
i
i
made
the
statement
generally
as
you
please
she
said
i
can
merely
say
that
my
brother
whom
i
expect
momentarily
is
although
an
invalid
in
some
respects
a
powerful
and
determined
man
and
unless
you
repeat
in
his
presence
the
sole
excuse
you
have
to
offer
he
will
certainly
horsewhip
you
in
the
presence
of
the
other
passengers
that
is
all
sir
thank
you
it
quite
enough
murmured
peter
thinking
that
alfred
himself
could
hardly
be
much
more
formidable
and
he
slipped
down
the
companion
to
the
where
he
found
miss
davenport
anxiously
expecting
him
he
is
here
she
whispered
i
have
just
seen
him
through
the
what
the
old
lady
brother
he
replied
he
has
sister
who
is
an
old
lady
i
mean
alfred
he
almost
yelped
alfred
of
course
he
is
here
is
not
his
battalion
quartered
at
gibraltar
you
knew
it
we
were
to
meet
him
here
i
did
indeed
or
i
should
never
have
come
he
protested
do
let
us
waste
words
now
he
is
here
he
will
demand
an
explanation
from
you
he
has
his
pistol
with
him
i
could
tell
by
the
bulge
under
his
coat
we
must
both
face
him
and
the
question
is
what
are
you
going
to
say
peter
thrust
his
hands
through
his
hair
say
he
repeated
i
shall
tell
him
the
simple
straightforward
truth
i
shall
frankly
admit
that
we
have
walked
and
sat
and
talked
together
but
i
shall
assure
him
as
i
can
honestly
that
during
the
whole
course
of
our
acquaintance
i
have
never
once
regarded
you
in
any
other
light
but
that
of
a
friend
and
you
suppose
that
knowing
how
i
have
changed
he
will
believe
that
she
cried
he
will
fire
long
before
you
can
finish
one
of
those
fine
sentences
in
that
case
suggested
peter
why
tell
him
anything
at
all
why
not
spare
him
poor
fellow
at
all
events
for
the
time
it
will
only
upset
him
just
now
let
him
suppose
that
we
are
strangers
to
one
another
and
you
can
break
the
truth
to
him
gently
when
you
reach
england
you
know
i
sure
that
the
more
sensible
plan
she
broke
into
strange
mirthless
laughter
your
prudence
comes
too
late
she
said
you
forget
that
the
truth
was
broken
to
him
some
days
ago
in
the
letter
i
wrote
from
brindisi
you
wrote
and
broke
it
to
him
at
brindisi
cried
peter
what
induced
you
to
do
why
she
retorted
you
insisted
that
it
was
due
to
him
and
though
i
knew
better
than
you
what
the
effect
would
be
i
dared
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
wanted
to
end
the
engagement
too
and
i
scarcely
cared
then
what
consequences
might
follow
now
they
are
upon
us
and
it
is
useless
to
try
to
escape
them
since
we
die
let
us
go
up
on
deck
and
get
it
over
one
moment
he
said
alfred
can
wait
a
little
i
i
must
go
to
my
cabin
first
and
put
on
a
clean
collar
and
with
this
rather
flimsy
pretext
he
again
made
his
escape
he
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
as
he
rushed
towards
his
cabin
he
could
hardly
have
been
anything
like
an
hour
on
board
the
as
yet
he
had
to
get
through
at
least
another
three
before
he
could
hope
for
deliverance
his
only
chance
was
to
barricade
himself
inside
his
cabin
and
steadfastly
refuse
to
come
out
upon
any
consideration
whatever
until
he
was
released
by
the
natural
expiration
of
time
he
sped
down
the
passage
and
found
to
his
horror
that
he
had
forgotten
the
number
of
his
berth
however
he
knew
where
it
ought
to
be
and
darted
into
an
open
door
which
he
fastened
securely
with
hook
and
bolt
and
sank
breathless
on
one
of
the
lower
berths
you
seem
in
a
hurry
my
friend
said
a
voice
opposite
and
peter
eyes
unused
at
first
to
the
comparative
dimness
perceived
that
a
big
man
was
sitting
on
the
opposite
berth
engaged
in
putting
on
a
pair
of
spiked
he
had
bolted
himself
inside
the
cabin
with
perkins
chapter
ix
compound
interest
to
the
fire
a
magnanimous
catching
at
two
total
purely
a
question
of
hemmed
in
and
surrounded
the
last
the
bank
manager
looked
across
at
peter
with
an
amused
smile
he
seemed
quite
friendly
whether
he
was
in
peter
cabin
or
peter
in
his
did
not
appear
and
perhaps
it
was
not
of
much
consequence
either
way
if
the
cabin
belonged
to
perkins
he
did
not
at
all
events
appear
to
resent
the
intrusion
you
seem
rather
put
out
about
something
he
said
again
as
peter
was
still
too
short
of
breath
for
words
oh
no
panted
peter
it
nothing
there
was
so
much
bustle
going
on
above
that
i
thought
i
come
in
here
for
a
little
quiet
that
all
well
said
the
manager
i
glad
you
looked
in
for
as
it
happens
you
the
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
i
daresay
wondering
why
i
putting
on
these
things
peter
nodded
his
head
which
was
all
he
felt
equal
to
why
i
just
been
having
a
talk
with
that
old
from
melbourne
perhaps
you
do
know
that
her
brother
is
coming
on
board
directly
oh
yes
i
said
peter
well
it
seems
she
means
to
denounce
me
to
him
as
the
slanderer
of
her
father
she
may
if
she
chooses
my
conscience
is
perfectly
clear
on
that
score
no
one
can
bring
anything
of
the
sort
home
to
me
and
i
no
doubt
i
shall
soon
satisfy
him
that
i
as
innocent
as
an
unborn
babe
still
i
want
you
as
a
respectable
man
and
the
only
real
friend
i
have
on
board
to
come
with
me
and
be
my
witness
that
you
never
heard
such
a
rumour
from
my
lips
and
besides
sir
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
at
last
of
seeing
the
unutterable
scamp
who
has
had
the
barefaced
impudence
to
say
i
told
him
this
precious
story
she
going
to
produce
him
sir
and
if
he
dares
to
stand
me
out
to
my
face
well
know
why
i
put
on
these
shoes
come
along
i
ca
let
you
off
peter
dared
not
refuse
for
fear
of
attracting
his
suspicions
he
could
only
trust
to
slipping
away
in
the
confusion
and
so
unfastening
the
the
manager
caught
the
unresisting
tourmalin
tightly
by
the
arm
and
hurried
him
along
the
central
passage
and
up
the
companion
even
miss
davenport
would
have
been
a
welcome
diversion
at
that
moment
but
she
was
not
there
to
intercept
him
and
he
reached
the
upper
deck
more
dead
than
alive
where
that
old
vixen
exclaimed
the
manager
dropping
peter
arm
here
just
stay
where
you
are
a
minute
till
i
find
her
and
her
confounded
brother
he
bustled
off
leaving
tourmalin
by
the
davits
quite
incapable
of
action
of
any
kind
in
the
presence
of
this
new
and
awful
dilemma
he
had
been
spreading
a
cruel
and
unjustifiable
slander
against
an
irreproachable
colonial
magnate
whose
son
was
now
at
hand
to
demand
reparation
with
a
horsewhip
he
could
only
propitiate
him
by
denouncing
perkins
as
his
informant
and
if
he
did
that
he
would
be
kicked
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
with
a
spiked
boot
this
was
nemesis
indeed
and
it
was
sophia
who
had
insisted
upon
his
exposing
himself
to
it
what
a
fool
he
was
not
to
fly
back
to
that
cabin
while
he
could
he
turned
to
flee
and
as
he
did
so
a
hand
was
passed
softly
through
his
arm
not
way
peter
said
miss
tyrrell
voice
a
wild
faint
hope
came
to
him
that
he
might
be
going
to
receive
one
of
the
back
quarters
of
an
hour
the
caprices
of
the
time
cheques
were
such
that
it
was
quite
possible
he
would
be
thrown
back
into
an
earlier
interview
little
as
he
felt
inclined
for
any
social
intercourse
just
then
he
saw
that
it
would
afford
him
a
brief
interlude
would
at
least
give
him
before
his
troubles
began
again
i
will
go
wherever
you
choose
he
said
i
am
in
your
hands
i
came
she
said
to
take
you
to
her
she
is
asking
for
you
she
said
peter
for
heaven
sake
why
miss
pinceney
of
course
i
knew
who
it
was
directly
i
saw
her
face
peter
is
it
true
as
papa
tells
me
that
i
misunderstood
you
just
now
that
she
is
engaged
to
alfred
alfred
no
he
replied
if
she
is
engaged
to
anyone
at
all
i
have
strong
grounds
for
supposing
it
to
me
then
we
must
submit
that
is
all
said
miss
tyrrell
but
we
do
not
know
her
decision
yet
there
is
still
hope
yes
he
said
there
is
hope
still
let
us
go
to
her
make
haste
he
meant
what
he
said
sophia
could
at
least
extricate
him
from
a
portion
of
his
difficulties
miss
tyrrell
magnanimous
and
unselfish
girl
that
she
was
in
spite
of
her
talent
for
misapprehension
was
ready
to
resign
him
to
a
prior
claim
if
one
was
made
and
sophia
was
bound
to
claim
him
for
if
the
engagement
between
them
had
been
broken
off
he
could
not
now
be
her
husband
as
he
was
even
time
cheques
must
recognise
accomplished
facts
he
followed
her
across
the
ship
turning
down
the
very
passage
in
which
he
had
sat
through
more
than
one
cheque
with
miss
davenport
and
on
the
opposite
side
he
found
sophia
standing
with
her
usual
composure
waiting
for
his
arrival
she
was
so
identically
the
same
sophia
that
he
had
left
so
lately
that
he
felt
reassured
she
at
least
could
not
be
the
dupe
of
all
this
she
had
come
how
he
did
not
trouble
himself
to
think
but
she
had
come
with
the
benevolent
intention
of
saving
him
how
do
you
do
my
love
he
began
i
i
thought
i
should
see
you
here
you
only
see
me
here
peter
she
replied
in
a
voice
that
trembled
slightly
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
command
it
because
i
felt
very
strongly
that
it
was
my
duty
to
put
an
end
at
the
earliest
moment
to
a
situation
which
has
become
impossible
i
sure
said
peter
it
is
quite
time
it
put
an
end
to
it
could
go
on
like
this
much
longer
it
shall
not
if
i
can
help
it
she
said
miss
tyrrell
pray
do
go
away
what
i
have
to
say
concerns
you
too
no
do
go
away
miss
tyrrell
added
peter
who
felt
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
sophia
superior
wisdom
and
was
now
persuaded
that
somehow
it
was
all
going
to
be
explained
sir
william
will
you
kindly
step
this
way
too
sir
william
tyrrell
miss
pinceney
miss
pinceney
has
something
to
tell
you
which
will
make
my
position
thoroughly
clear
i
have
only
to
say
she
said
that
your
honourable
and
straightforward
conduct
peter
has
touched
me
to
the
very
heart
i
feel
that
i
am
the
only
person
to
blame
for
it
was
i
who
insisted
upon
your
subjecting
yourself
to
this
test
it
was
said
peter
i
told
you
something
would
happen
and
it
has
i
would
never
hold
you
to
a
union
from
which
all
love
on
your
side
had
fled
do
not
think
so
peter
and
now
that
i
see
my
my
rival
i
confess
that
i
could
expect
no
other
result
so
dear
miss
tyrrell
i
resign
him
to
you
freely
yes
cheerfully
for
by
your
womanly
you
have
proved
yourself
the
worthier
take
her
peter
you
have
my
full
consent
my
dear
young
lady
said
the
judge
deeply
affected
this
is
most
noble
of
you
allow
me
to
shake
you
by
the
hand
i
ca
thank
you
dear
miss
pinceney
sobbed
his
daughter
peter
tell
her
for
me
how
we
shall
both
bless
and
love
her
all
our
lives
for
this
peter
brain
reeled
was
sophia
notion
of
getting
him
out
of
a
difficulty
as
he
gazed
distractedly
around
his
eyes
became
fixed
and
glazed
with
a
new
terror
a
stalwart
stranger
with
a
bushy
red
beard
was
coming
towards
him
with
a
stout
in
his
right
hand
by
his
side
walked
the
manager
from
whose
face
all
vestige
of
friendliness
had
vanished
as
soon
as
you
have
quite
finished
your
conversation
with
these
ladies
said
the
manager
with
iron
politeness
this
gentleman
would
be
glad
of
a
few
moments
with
you
after
which
i
shall
request
your
attention
to
a
little
personal
affair
of
my
own
let
us
you
you
know
i
i
wo
returned
peter
flurriedly
but
i
rather
busy
just
now
a
little
later
i
i
shall
be
delighted
as
he
stood
there
he
was
aware
that
they
had
withdrawn
to
a
bench
some
distance
away
where
they
conferred
with
the
elderly
lady
from
melbourne
he
could
feel
their
angry
glare
upon
him
and
it
contributed
to
rob
him
of
the
little
he
had
left
sophia
he
faltered
piteously
i
say
this
is
too
bad
it
is
really
you
mean
to
leave
me
in
such
a
hole
as
this
do
let
get
home
at
once
before
she
could
make
any
reply
to
an
appeal
which
seemed
to
astonish
her
considerably
a
thin
man
with
a
face
twitching
with
nervous
excitement
a
heavy
black
moustache
and
haggard
eyes
in
which
a
red
fire
smouldered
appeared
at
the
gangway
and
joined
the
group
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
lifting
his
hat
forgive
me
if
i
interrupt
you
but
my
business
is
urgent
most
urgent
perhaps
you
could
kindly
inform
me
if
there
is
a
a
gentleman
the
word
cost
him
a
manifest
struggle
to
pronounce
a
gentleman
on
board
of
the
name
of
tourmalin
i
have
a
little
matter
of
business
here
his
right
hand
stole
to
his
to
transact
with
him
he
explained
with
a
sinister
smile
that
caused
peter
to
give
suddenly
at
the
knees
it
that
infernal
alfred
he
thought
now
i
done
for
why
said
miss
tyrrell
who
was
clinging
affectionately
to
peter
arm
is
tourmalin
you
can
speak
to
him
now
here
if
you
choose
we
have
no
secrets
from
one
another
have
we
peter
i
have
lately
learnt
said
the
gloomy
man
that
a
certain
tourmalin
has
stolen
from
me
the
affection
of
one
who
was
all
heaven
and
earth
to
me
then
it
be
another
tourmalin
said
miss
tyrrell
not
this
one
because
surely
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
you
have
no
rivalry
to
fear
from
him
she
broke
off
with
a
blush
of
charming
embarrassment
alfred
scowl
distinctly
relaxed
and
peter
felt
that
after
all
this
unfortunate
misunderstanding
on
miss
tyrrell
part
might
prove
serviceable
to
him
since
sophia
for
reasons
of
her
own
refused
to
assist
him
he
must
accept
any
other
help
that
offered
itself
the
best
proof
i
can
give
you
of
my
innocence
he
said
is
to
mention
that
i
have
the
honour
to
be
engaged
to
this
lady
he
heard
a
stifled
shriek
from
behind
him
as
he
made
this
assertion
and
the
next
moment
miss
davenport
who
must
have
come
up
in
time
to
catch
the
last
words
had
burst
into
the
centre
of
the
group
it
is
not
true
she
cried
alfred
you
must
not
believe
him
not
exclaimed
alfred
sophia
miss
tyrrell
and
sir
william
in
the
same
breath
no
said
miss
davenport
at
least
if
he
has
really
engaged
himself
it
is
within
the
last
few
minutes
and
with
the
chivalrous
intention
of
shielding
peter
i
will
not
be
shielded
by
such
means
our
love
is
too
precious
to
be
publicly
denied
i
can
not
suffer
it
i
will
acknowledge
it
though
it
costs
me
my
life
you
she
added
turning
to
sophia
you
can
prove
that
i
speak
the
truth
it
was
to
you
that
i
confided
that
day
we
met
on
deck
the
story
of
our
fatal
attachment
i
really
think
you
must
be
mistaken
said
sophia
coldly
if
you
confided
such
a
story
to
anybody
it
could
not
have
been
to
me
for
until
a
few
minutes
ago
i
had
never
set
foot
upon
this
ship
how
sophia
could
stand
there
and
remembering
as
she
must
do
her
recent
appropriation
of
the
time
cheque
tell
such
a
downright
fib
as
this
passed
peter
comprehension
but
as
her
statement
was
in
his
favour
so
far
as
it
went
he
knew
better
than
to
contradict
it
whether
it
was
you
or
not
insisted
miss
davenport
it
is
he
and
no
one
else
who
rendered
my
engagement
to
alfred
utterly
repugnant
to
me
can
you
look
at
him
now
and
doubt
me
longer
so
peter
said
sophia
severely
you
could
not
even
be
faithful
to
your
unfaithfulness
miss
tyrrell
made
no
comment
but
she
dropped
his
arm
as
if
it
had
scorched
her
fingers
whereupon
miss
davenport
clung
to
it
in
her
stead
to
peter
infinite
dismay
and
confusion
he
faithful
she
cried
it
is
only
a
mistaken
sense
of
honour
that
made
him
apparently
false
yes
alfred
what
i
wrote
to
you
and
the
postscript
he
added
is
the
simple
truth
we
can
not
command
our
own
hearts
such
love
as
i
once
had
for
you
is
dead
it
died
on
the
fatal
day
which
brought
him
across
my
path
we
met
we
love
deal
with
us
as
you
will
i
would
rather
ever
so
much
rather
die
with
him
than
lose
him
now
alfred
was
already
beginning
to
fumble
fiercely
in
his
peter
felt
the
time
had
arrived
for
plain
speaking
he
could
not
submit
to
be
butchered
under
a
ridiculous
misapprehension
of
this
kind
listen
to
me
he
said
eagerly
before
you
do
anything
rash
or
you
may
bitterly
regret
it
afterwards
i
do
assure
you
that
i
am
the
victim
we
are
the
victims
of
a
series
of
unfortunate
cheques
i
should
say
mistakes
it
absurd
to
make
me
responsible
for
the
irregular
proceedings
of
a
nonsensical
bank
if
i
had
spent
my
time
as
i
ought
to
have
done
the
time
instead
of
putting
it
out
on
deposit
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
employing
it
in
any
kind
of
philandering
that
said
sophia
is
undeniable
but
you
spent
it
as
you
ought
to
have
done
such
a
speech
comes
ill
from
you
he
said
reproachfully
after
having
expressly
condoned
the
past
and
however
i
may
have
appeared
to
philander
i
can
conscientiously
declare
that
my
sentiments
towards
both
of
these
young
ladies
you
understand
have
been
restricted
to
a
respectful
and
and
merely
friendly
esteem
do
shoot
alfred
i
thought
that
was
quite
understood
on
all
sides
only
have
a
little
more
patience
alfred
and
i
will
undertake
to
convince
even
you
that
i
could
not
for
a
moment
have
contemplated
depriving
you
of
the
hand
of
this
extremely
charming
and
attractive
lady
who
will
let
go
my
arm
i
i
am
a
married
man
married
shrieked
miss
davenport
cowering
back
married
exclaimed
miss
tyrrell
as
she
hid
her
face
upon
her
father
shoulder
married
shouted
the
judge
by
heavens
sir
you
shall
account
to
me
for
this
married
cried
sophia
oh
peter
i
was
prepared
for
this
when
where
where
he
echoed
you
were
not
prepared
for
it
perhaps
you
will
ask
me
next
who
my
wife
is
i
shall
not
indeed
said
sophia
for
i
have
no
longer
the
slightest
curiosity
on
such
a
subject
peter
collapsed
upon
the
nearest
bench
sophia
he
cried
hoarsely
why
keep
this
up
any
longer
surely
it
is
gone
far
enough
you
pretend
you
do
know
but
while
he
spoke
the
words
he
saw
suddenly
that
his
attempt
to
force
her
hand
was
hopeless
she
was
quite
sincere
in
her
surprise
she
was
the
sophia
of
months
and
no
amount
of
explanation
could
ever
make
her
comprehend
what
had
happened
since
that
time
and
here
alfred
broke
his
silence
what
you
have
just
confessed
he
said
removes
my
last
scruple
i
might
for
all
i
can
tell
have
stayed
my
hand
and
spared
your
life
upon
your
promise
to
make
maud
happy
for
in
spite
of
her
treatment
of
me
her
happiness
is
still
my
first
consideration
but
now
you
have
declared
that
impossible
why
as
soon
as
i
can
get
this
revolver
out
of
my
pocket
for
it
has
stuck
in
the
confounded
lining
i
will
shoot
you
like
a
rabbit
sir
william
cried
peter
i
appeal
to
you
you
are
the
representative
of
law
and
order
here
he
is
threatening
a
breach
of
the
peace
the
peace
i
call
upon
you
to
interfere
i
am
no
advocate
said
sir
william
with
judicial
calm
for
taking
the
law
into
one
own
hands
i
even
express
a
hope
that
this
gentleman
will
not
carry
out
his
avowed
intention
at
least
until
i
have
had
time
to
withdraw
and
i
must
not
be
understood
to
approve
his
action
in
any
way
at
the
same
time
i
am
distinctly
of
opinion
that
he
has
received
sufficient
provocation
to
excuse
even
such
extreme
measures
and
that
the
fate
he
threatens
will
if
summary
at
least
be
richly
deserved
i
think
so
too
said
sophia
though
it
would
be
painful
to
be
compelled
to
witness
it
terrible
agreed
miss
tyrrell
let
us
hide
our
eyes
dear
stay
alfred
miss
davenport
implored
have
some
pity
think
with
all
your
faults
you
are
a
keen
sportsman
you
would
not
shoot
even
a
rabbit
sitting
give
tourmalin
a
start
of
a
few
seconds
let
him
have
a
run
before
you
fire
all
this
time
alfred
was
still
fumbling
for
and
execrating
the
obstinate
weapon
i
decline
to
run
peter
cried
from
his
seat
he
knew
too
well
that
he
could
not
stir
a
limb
shoot
me
sitting
or
not
at
all
but
do
keep
me
waiting
any
longer
his
prayer
seemed
likely
to
be
granted
for
alfred
had
at
last
succeeded
in
extricating
the
revolver
but
before
he
could
take
aim
the
bank
manager
and
the
melbourne
man
ran
in
and
interposed
hold
on
one
minute
sir
they
said
we
too
have
business
with
the
gentleman
on
the
seat
there
and
you
will
admit
that
it
must
be
concluded
before
yours
if
it
is
to
be
settled
at
all
we
must
really
ask
you
to
postpone
your
little
affair
until
we
have
finished
we
will
not
keep
you
waiting
any
longer
than
we
can
help
the
judge
with
an
ostentatious
indifference
had
strolled
away
to
the
probably
to
avoid
being
called
upon
to
decide
so
nice
a
point
as
this
disputed
precedence
his
daughter
miss
davenport
and
sophia
had
turned
their
backs
and
stopping
their
ears
were
begging
to
be
told
when
all
was
over
alfred
was
struggling
to
free
his
which
was
firmly
held
by
the
other
two
men
and
all
three
were
talking
at
once
in
hot
and
argumentative
support
of
their
claims
as
for
peter
he
sat
and
looked
on
glued
to
his
seat
by
terror
if
he
had
any
preference
among
the
disputants
he
rather
hoped
that
alfred
would
be
the
person
to
gain
his
point
all
at
once
he
saw
sophia
turn
round
and
with
her
fingers
still
pressed
to
her
ears
make
energetic
contortions
of
her
lips
evidently
for
his
benefit
after
one
or
two
repetitions
he
made
out
the
words
she
was
voicelessly
framing
for
it
he
interpreted
while
you
can
with
his
habitual
respect
for
her
advice
he
rose
and
finding
that
the
power
of
motion
had
suddenly
returned
he
run
for
it
he
slipped
quietly
round
the
corner
and
down
the
passage
to
the
other
side
of
the
ship
where
he
hoped
to
reach
the
and
eventually
regain
his
cabin
unhappily
for
him
the
grim
lady
from
melbourne
had
noted
his
flight
and
anticipated
its
object
long
before
he
got
to
the
open
doors
he
saw
her
step
out
and
bar
the
way
she
had
an
open
sunshade
in
her
hand
which
she
was
preparing
to
use
as
a
butterfly
net
he
turned
and
fled
abruptly
in
the
opposite
direction
intending
to
cross
the
bridge
which
led
aft
to
the
saloon
deck
where
he
might
find
cover
but
as
he
saw
on
turning
the
corner
the
manager
had
already
occupied
the
passage
peter
turned
again
and
doubled
back
across
the
ship
making
for
the
forecastle
but
he
was
too
late
for
the
melbourne
man
was
there
before
him
and
cut
off
all
hope
of
retreat
in
that
quarter
there
was
only
one
thing
left
now
he
must
take
to
the
rigging
and
accordingly
the
next
moment
scarcely
knowing
how
he
came
there
he
was
clambering
up
the
shrouds
for
dear
life
higher
and
higher
he
climbed
slipping
and
stumbling
and
catching
his
unaccustomed
feet
in
the
ratlins
at
every
step
and
all
the
way
he
had
a
dismal
conviction
that
as
yet
he
had
not
nearly
exhausted
the
cheque
he
had
drawn
he
must
have
at
least
another
couple
of
hours
to
get
through
not
to
mention
the
compound
interest
which
the
bank
seemed
characteristically
enough
to
be
paying
first
still
if
he
could
only
stay
quietly
up
aloft
till
his
time
was
up
he
might
escape
the
worst
yet
surely
it
was
a
sufficient
penalty
for
his
folly
to
have
embroiled
himself
with
every
creature
he
knew
to
have
been
chivied
about
the
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
by
three
violent
men
each
thirsting
for
his
blood
and
to
be
reduced
to
mount
the
rigging
like
an
escaped
monkey
a
few
more
steps
and
he
was
safe
at
last
just
above
was
a
huge
yard
flattened
on
the
upper
surface
with
a
partially
furled
sail
behind
which
he
could
crouch
unseen
his
hands
were
almost
upon
it
when
a
bronzed
and
bearded
face
appeared
above
the
canvas
it
was
one
of
the
english
crew
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
man
civilly
enough
but
i
shall
fur
to
trouble
you
to
go
down
agin
please
strick
orders
sir
passengers
ai
allowed
to
amuse
theirselves
climbing
the
rigging
my
good
man
said
peter
between
his
pants
do
i
as
if
i
was
amusing
myself
i
am
pursued
i
tell
you
as
an
honest
british
seaman
which
i
am
sure
you
are
i
entreat
you
to
give
me
a
hand
up
and
hide
me
it
it
may
be
life
or
death
for
me
the
man
wavered
the
desperate
plight
peter
was
in
seemed
to
arouse
his
compassion
as
it
well
might
i
yer
i
suppose
come
to
that
he
said
slowly
but
it
too
late
to
think
o
that
now
look
below
sir
peter
glanced
down
between
his
feet
and
saw
two
swarthy
lascars
climbing
the
rigging
like
cats
lower
still
he
had
a
view
of
the
deck
about
which
his
enemies
were
posted
in
readiness
for
his
arrival
the
manager
exhibiting
his
spiked
boots
to
sir
william
who
shook
his
head
in
mild
deprecation
the
old
lady
brandishing
her
sunshade
in
angry
denunciation
while
her
brother
flourished
his
horsewhip
and
alfred
stood
covering
him
with
his
revolver
prepared
to
pick
him
off
the
instant
he
came
within
range
and
peter
hung
there
by
his
hands
for
his
feet
had
slipped
out
of
the
ratlins
as
helpless
a
target
as
any
innocent
bottle
in
a
and
the
lascars
were
getting
nearer
and
nearer
he
could
see
their
bilious
eyeballs
and
their
teeth
gleaming
in
their
dusky
faces
he
felt
a
bony
hand
reaching
for
his
ankles
and
then
a
dizziness
came
over
him
his
grip
upon
the
coarse
tarry
cordage
relaxed
and
shutting
his
eyes
he
fell
down
down
down
would
the
fall
never
come
to
an
end
would
he
never
arrive
chapter
dénoûment
at
last
the
shock
was
over
and
he
feebly
opened
his
eyes
once
more
to
find
that
he
was
undoubtedly
on
the
deck
and
yes
the
bank
manager
was
standing
over
him
with
a
kind
of
triumphant
grin
mercy
peter
murmured
faintly
you
you
surely
would
kick
a
man
when
he
down
my
dear
sir
protested
the
manager
why
should
i
wish
to
kick
you
in
position
he
must
be
fatally
injured
if
even
the
manager
had
relented
is
is
alfred
there
asked
tourmalin
anxiously
keep
him
away
if
you
can
certainly
said
perkins
who
alfred
why
the
the
man
with
the
revolver
i
thought
you
knew
come
come
said
the
manager
there
no
man
of
that
kind
here
i
assure
you
pull
yourself
together
sir
you
on
board
the
now
i
know
said
peter
dolefully
i
know
i
am
he
shut
his
eyes
resignedly
he
was
about
to
receive
some
other
portion
of
his
if
he
could
only
hope
that
no
fresh
complications
would
arise
would
he
meet
miss
tyrrell
or
miss
davenport
next
he
wondered
and
how
would
they
behave
have
you
had
sleep
enough
yet
said
the
manager
you
not
more
than
even
now
sleep
exclaimed
tourmalin
sitting
up
and
rubbing
his
eyes
why
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
i
been
dreaming
all
this
time
i
do
know
about
dreaming
but
i
can
answer
for
your
snoring
why
you
almost
drowned
the
ship
band
i
knew
what
would
happen
when
you
have
two
helpings
of
curry
at
breakfast
worst
thing
to
take
in
the
world
especially
if
you
do
walk
it
off
why
you
been
the
joke
of
the
whole
ship
for
the
last
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
yourself
with
your
head
hanging
over
the
arm
of
your
chair
and
your
mouth
wide
open
i
thought
at
last
it
was
only
kind
to
wake
you
up
those
two
young
ladies
over
there
have
been
in
fits
of
laughter
peter
picked
up
buckle
which
was
lying
face
downwards
on
the
deck
his
own
face
was
very
red
possibly
from
stooping
as
he
inquired
er
two
young
ladies
ca
tell
you
their
names
but
those
two
uncommonly
girls
one
in
white
and
and
the
darker
one
in
pink
dear
me
i
thought
they
would
have
died
even
now
they
seemed
to
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
controlling
their
countenances
for
happening
just
then
to
look
round
and
catch
peter
glance
of
confused
and
still
somnolent
suspicion
they
buried
their
faces
in
their
handkerchiefs
once
more
in
agonies
of
suppressed
mirth
and
these
were
the
two
whom
his
dreaming
fancies
had
pictured
as
tenderly
desperately
madly
devoted
to
him
the
reality
was
decidedly
disenchanting
they
were
very
ordinary
girls
he
saw
after
all
well
said
perkins
it
not
far
off
tiffin
time
now
so
you
see
you
managed
to
get
through
your
extra
time
after
all
yes
said
peter
with
a
little
natural
embarrassment
but
i
think
do
you
know
that
on
reflection
i
i
deposit
the
extra
hours
after
all
if
you
will
kindly
take
back
the
the
he
added
feeling
in
his
pockets
and
give
me
the
form
i
signed
we
will
consider
the
arrangement
cancelled
eh
it
my
belief
said
the
manager
that
your
head
is
quite
clear
yet
for
hang
me
if
i
know
what
you
talking
about
deposit
form
what
is
it
all
about
peter
coloured
more
furiously
than
before
it
was
the
curry
he
said
i
was
quite
sure
whether
but
really
too
absurd
to
explain
i
am
now
at
all
events
he
was
awake
now
and
knew
that
no
of
this
monstrous
kind
had
ever
been
actually
effected
and
all
the
wild
events
which
seemed
to
have
taken
whole
months
to
accomplish
themselves
were
the
work
of
a
single
hour
indigestion
he
was
still
a
bachelor
still
engaged
to
sophia
he
had
still
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
miss
tyrrell
and
miss
davenport
and
endure
the
ordeal
of
remaining
for
some
weeks
to
come
to
say
nothing
of
the
extra
hours
exposed
to
the
peril
of
their
fascinations
but
whatever
happened
now
it
could
not
be
said
at
least
that
he
had
not
received
abundant
warning
of
the
consequences
which
might
ensue
from
any
yielding
however
blameless
or
defensible
on
his
part
and
peter
tourmalin
resolved
that
henceforth
buckle
should
monopolise
his
attention
the
epilogue
there
are
always
a
few
inquiring
persons
who
at
the
conclusion
of
any
story
insist
upon
being
told
what
happened
after
that
and
if
such
a
question
is
ever
justified
it
is
so
in
the
case
of
a
narrative
that
as
in
the
present
instance
ends
almost
at
the
precise
moment
at
which
it
began
so
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
readers
may
be
sufficiently
interested
to
wish
to
know
the
particular
effect
produced
upon
peter
tourmalin
subsequent
conduct
by
a
vision
more
than
usually
complicated
and
connected
did
he
receive
it
for
example
as
a
solemnly
prophetic
warning
and
forswear
all
female
society
while
on
board
the
or
was
he
rather
prompted
to
prove
its
fallibility
by
actual
experience
as
to
the
motives
which
guided
him
we
are
unable
to
speak
with
confidence
and
they
must
be
left
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
reader
knowledge
of
human
nature
in
general
and
peter
so
far
as
it
has
been
by
his
unconscious
imagination
in
these
pages
in
particular
but
the
author
is
in
a
position
to
state
with
certainty
that
when
sophia
and
her
mother
met
the
ship
as
they
duly
did
at
gibraltar
nothing
on
peter
part
gave
them
the
slightest
ground
for
suspecting
that
he
was
on
terms
of
even
the
most
distant
acquaintanceship
with
either
miss
tyrrell
or
miss
davenport
and
that
the
fact
of
his
being
far
advanced
in
the
third
volume
of
buckle
of
seemed
to
guarantee
that
he
had
employed
his
spare
time
on
board
the
vessel
both
wisely
and
well
nor
did
he
get
into
any
difficulties
by
circulating
gossip
concerning
any
matron
from
melbourne
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
there
was
no
lady
passenger
who
at
all
answered
the
description
she
like
much
else
in
his
experiences
was
purely
a
creation
of
the
curry
lastly
it
may
be
added
that
peter
is
now
married
to
his
sophia
and
is
far
happier
than
even
he
could
have
expected
she
tempers
her
intellectuality
out
of
consideration
for
his
mental
bareness
and
as
yet
he
has
never
found
her
society
in
the
least
oppressive
nor
has
his
errant
fancy
wandered
back
in
any
perfidious
sense
to
the
time
he
spent
when
freed
from
her
supervision

board
