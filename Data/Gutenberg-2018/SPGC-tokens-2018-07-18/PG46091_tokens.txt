george
i
was
up
before
daylight
we
got
the
horses
saddled
and
galloped
down
the
shell
road
over
the
piney
patch
then
coasting
the
bayou
lake
we
crossed
the
long
swamps
by
paul
path
and
so
came
home
again
you
seem
already
familiar
with
the
names
of
every
spot
on
the
estate
breakfast
just
one
month
ago
i
quitted
paris
i
left
that
siren
city
as
i
would
have
left
a
beloved
woman
no
wonder
i
dare
say
you
left
at
least
a
dozen
beloved
women
there
at
the
same
time
i
feel
that
i
departed
amid
universal
and
sincere
regret
i
left
my
loves
and
my
creditors
equally
inconsolable
george
you
are
incorrigible
ah
you
remind
me
so
much
of
your
uncle
the
judge
bless
his
dear
old
handwriting
it
all
i
ever
saw
of
him
for
ten
years
his
letters
came
every
with
a
remittance
and
a
word
of
advice
in
his
formal
cavalier
style
and
then
a
joke
in
the
postscript
that
upset
the
dignity
of
the
foregoing
aunt
when
he
died
two
years
ago
i
read
over
those
letters
of
his
and
if
i
did
cry
like
a
baby
no
george
say
you
wept
like
a
man
and
so
you
really
kept
those
foolish
letters
yes
i
kept
the
letters
and
squandered
the
money
ah
why
were
you
not
my
son
you
are
so
like
my
dear
husband
salem
scudder
ai
he
yes
when
i
saw
him
and
miss
zoe
galloping
through
the
green
sugar
crop
and
doing
ten
dollars
worth
of
damage
at
every
stride
says
i
how
like
his
old
uncle
he
do
make
the
dirt
fly
o
aunt
what
a
bright
gay
creature
she
is
what
zoe
guess
that
you
did
leave
anything
female
in
europe
that
can
lift
an
eyelash
beside
that
gal
when
she
goes
along
she
just
leaves
a
streak
of
love
behind
her
it
a
good
drink
to
see
her
come
into
the
cotton
fields
the
niggers
get
fresh
on
the
sight
of
her
if
she
ai
worth
her
weight
in
sunshine
you
may
take
one
of
my
fingers
off
and
choose
which
you
like
she
need
not
keep
us
waiting
breakfast
though
pete
tell
miss
zoe
that
we
are
waiting
yes
missus
why
minnie
why
do
you
run
when
you
hear
you
lazy
crittur
minnie
dat
de
laziest
nigger
on
dis
yere
property
do
do
nuffin
my
dear
george
you
are
left
in
your
uncle
will
heir
to
this
estate
subject
to
your
life
interest
and
an
annuity
to
zoe
is
it
not
so
i
fear
that
the
property
is
so
involved
that
the
strictest
economy
will
scarcely
recover
it
my
dear
husband
never
kept
any
accounts
and
we
scarcely
know
in
what
condition
the
estate
really
is
yes
we
do
it
in
a
darned
bad
condition
ten
years
ago
the
judge
took
as
overseer
a
bit
of
connecticut
hardware
called
the
judge
did
understand
accounts
the
overseer
did
for
a
year
or
two
all
went
fine
the
judge
drew
money
like
bourbon
whiskey
from
a
barrel
and
never
turned
off
the
tap
but
out
it
flew
free
for
everybody
or
anybody
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
so
it
went
till
one
day
the
judge
found
the
tap
would
run
he
looked
in
to
see
what
stopped
it
and
pulled
out
a
big
mortgage
sign
that
says
the
overseer
it
only
a
formality
all
right
says
the
judge
and
away
went
a
thousand
acres
so
at
the
end
of
eight
years
jacob
esquire
finds
himself
proprietor
of
the
richest
half
of
terrebonne
but
the
other
half
is
free
no
it
ai
because
just
then
what
does
the
judge
do
but
hire
another
overseer
a
yankee
a
yankee
named
salem
scudder
o
no
it
was
hold
on
now
i
going
to
straighten
this
account
clear
out
what
was
this
here
scudder
well
he
lived
in
new
york
by
with
his
heels
up
in
front
of
french
hotel
and
inventin
inventing
what
improvements
anything
from
a
to
a
well
he
cut
that
for
the
photographing
line
he
and
his
apparatus
arrived
here
took
the
judge
likeness
and
his
fancy
who
made
him
overseer
right
off
well
sir
what
does
this
scudder
do
but
introduces
his
inventions
and
improvements
on
this
estate
his
new
cotton
gins
broke
down
the
steam
burst
up
until
he
finished
off
with
his
folly
what
with
his
knavery
began
o
salem
how
can
you
say
so
have
you
worked
like
a
horse
no
i
worked
like
an
ass
an
honest
one
and
all
now
george
between
the
two
overseers
you
and
that
good
old
lady
have
come
to
the
ground

the
state
of

is
treated
by
the
neighbors
with
a
kind
of
familiar
condescension
that
annoyed
me
do
you
know
that
she
is
the
natural
daughter
of
the
judge
your
uncle
and
that
old
lady
thar
just
adored
anything
her
husband
cared

hated

you
horrible
man
go
on
george
dora
now
i
like
a
little
business
if
agreeable
i
bring
you
news
your
banker
old
lafouche
of
new
orleans
is
dead
the
executors
are
winding
up
his
affairs
and
have
foreclosed
on
all
overdue
mortgages
so
terrebonne
is
for
sale
here
the
picayune
with
the
advertisement
terrebonne
for
sale
terrebonne
for
sale
and
you
sir
will
doubtless
become
its
purchaser
well
i
spose
there
no
law
agin
my
bidding
for
it
the
more
bidders
the
better
for
you
you
take
care
i
guess
it
do
go
too
cheap
o
sir
i
do
value
the
place
for
its
price
but
for
the
many
happy
days
i
spent
here
that
landscape
flat
and
uninteresting
though
it
may
be
is
full
of
charm
for
me
those
poor
people
born
around
me
growing
up
about
my
heart
have
bounded
my
view
of
life
and
now
to
lose
that
homely
scene
lose
their
black
ungainly
faces
o
sir
perhaps
you
should
be
as
old
as
i
am
to
feel
as
i
do
when
my
past
life
is
torn
away
from
me
i
be
darned
glad
if
somebody
would
tear
my
past
life
away
from
me
sorry
i
ca
help
you
but
the
fact
is
you
in
such
an
mess
that
you
could
be
pulled
out
without
a
derrick
yes
there
is
a
hope
left
yet
and
i
cling
to
it
the
house
of
mason
brothers
of
liverpool
failed
some
twenty
years
ago
in
my
husband
debt
they
owed
him
over
fifty
thousand
dollars
i
can
not
find
the
entry
in
my
husband
accounts
but
you
can
doubtless
detect
it
zoe
bring
here
the
old
desk
it
is
in
the
library
zoe
you
do
expect
to
recover
any
of
this
old
debt
do
you
yes
the
firm
has
recovered
itself
and
i
received
a
notice
two
months
ago
that
some
settlement
might
be
anticipated
why
with
principal
and
interest
this
debt
has
been
more
than
doubled
in
twenty
years
but
it
may
be
years
yet
before
it
will
be
paid
off
if
ever
if
there
a
chance
of
it
there
not
a
planter
round
here
who
would
lend
you
the
whole
cash
to
keep
your
name
and
blood
amongst
us
come
cheer
up
old
friend
ah
sunnyside
how
good
you
are
so
like
my
poor
peyton
peyton
sunnyside
curse
their
old
families
they
cut
me
a
bilious
conceited
thin
lot
of
dried
up
aristocracy
i
hate
just
because
my
grandfather
was
some
virginia
transplant
or
a
stingy
old
creole
i
ai
fit
to
sit
down
with
the
same
meat
with
them
it
makes
my
blood
so
hot
i
feel
my
heart
hiss
i
sweep
these
peytons
from
this
section
of
the
country
their
presence
keeps
alive
the
reproach
against
me
that
i
ruined
them
yet
if
this
money
should
come
bah
there
no
chance
of
it
then
if
they
go
take
zoe
she
follow
them

that
girl
she
makes
me
quiver
when
i
think
of
her
she
took

all
i
worth
zoe
house
the
o
here
do
you
know
what
annuity
the
old
judge
left

worth
not
a
picayune

the
love

the
papers
and
accounts

on
the
table

senior
partner
in
the
concern
i
reckon
you
got
the
big
lick
what
d
mean
let
me
proceed
by
illustration
look
thar
with
knife
off
d
see
that
tree
it
called
a
live
oak
and
is
a
native
here
beside
it
grows
a
creeper
year
after
year
that
creeper
twines
its
long
arms
round
and
round
the
tree
sucking
the
earth
dry
all
about
its
roots
living
on
its
life
overrunning
its
branches
until
at
last
the
live
oak
withers
and
dies
out
do
you
know
what
the
niggers
round
here
call
that
sight
they
call
it
the
yankee
hugging
the
creole
scudder
i
listened
to
a
great
many
of
your
insinuations
and
now
i
like
to
come
to
an
understanding
what
they
mean
if
you
want
a
quarrel
no
i
the
skurriest
crittur
at
a
fight
you
ever
see
my
legs
have
been
too
well
brought
up
to
stand
and
see
my
body
abused
i
take
good
care
of
myself
i
can
tell
you
because
i
heard
that
you
had
traduced
my
character
traduced
whoever
said
so
lied
i
always
said
you
were
the
darndest
thief
that
ever
escaped
a
white
jail
to
misrepresent
the
north
to
the
south
hand
to
back
of
his
what
take
your
hand
down
take
it
down
his
whenever
i
gets
into
company
like
yours
i
always
start
with
the
advantage
on
my
side
what
d
mean
i
mean
that
before
you
could
draw
that
you
wear
down
your
back
i
cut
you
into
shingles
keep
quiet
and
let
talk
sense
you
wanted
to
come
to
an
understanding
and
i
coming
thar
as
quick
as
i
can
now
jacob
you
despise
me
because
you
think
i
a
fool
i
despise
you
because
i
know
you
to
be
a
knave
between
us
we
ruined
these
peytons
you
fired
the
judge
and
i
finished
off
the
widow
now
i
feel
bad
about
my
share
in
the
business
give
half
the
balance
of
my
life
to
wipe
out
my
part
of
the
work
many
a
night
i
laid
awake
and
thought
how
to
pull
them
through
till
i
cried
like
a
child
over
the
sum
i
could
do
and
you
know
how
darned
hard
is
to
make
a
yankee
cry
well
what
that
to
me
hold
on
jacob
i
coming
to
that
i
tell
ye
i
such
a
fool
i
ca
bear
the
feeling
it
keeps
at
me
like
a
skin
complaint
and
if
this
family
is
sold
up
what
then
i
cut
my
throat
or
yours
yours
i
prefer
would
you
now
why
do
you
do
it
i
skeered
to
try
i
never
killed
a
man
in
my
life
and
civilization
is
so
strong
in
me
i
guess
i
could
do
it
i
like
to
though
and
all
for
the
sake
of
that
old
woman
and
that
young
puppy
eh
no
other
cause
to
hate
to
envy
me
to
be
jealous
of
me
eh
jealous
what
for
ask
the
color
in
your
face
d
think
i
ca
read
you
like
a
book
with
your
new
england
hypocrisy
you
would
persuade
yourself
it
was
this
family
alone
you
cared
for
it
ai
you
know
it
ai
is
the
octoroon
and
you
love
her
as

by
my
dear
uncle
is
a
noble
heritage
which
no
sheriff
can
seize
with
that
i
can
build
up
a
fortune
spread
a
roof
over
the
heads
i
love
and
place
before
them
the
food
i
have
earned
i
will
work
work
i
thought
none
but
colored
people
worked
work
zoe
is
the
salt
that
gives
savor
to
life
dora
said
you
were
slow
if
she
could
hear
you
now
zoe
you
are
young
your
mirror
must
have
told
you
that
you
are
beautiful
is
your
heart
free
free
of
course
it
is
we
have
known
each
other
but
a
few
days
but
to
me
those
days
have
been
worth
all
the
rest
of
my
life
zoe
you
have
suspected
the
feeling
that
now
commands
an
utterance
you
have
seen
that
i
love
you
me
you
love
me
as
my
wife
the
sharer
of
my
hopes
my
ambitions
and
my
sorrows
under
the
shelter
of
your
love
i
could
watch
the
storms
of
fortune
pass
unheeded
by
my
love
my
love
george
you
know
not
what
you
say
i
the
sharer
of
your
sorrows
your
wife
do
you
know
what
i
am
your
birth
i
know
it
has
not
my
dear
aunt
forgotten
it
she
who
had
the
most
right
to
remember
it
you
are
illegitimate
but
love
knows
no
prejudice
alas
he
does
not
know
he
does
not
know
and
will
despise
me
spurn
me
loathe
me
when
he
learns
who
what
he
has
so
george
o
forgive
me
yes
i
love
you
i
did
not
know
it
until
your
words
showed
me
what
has
been
in
my
heart
each
of
them
awoke
a
new
sense
and
now
i
know
how
unhappy
how
very
unhappy
i
am
zoe
what
have
i
said
to
wound
you
nothing
but
you
must
learn
what
i
thought
you
already
knew
george
you
can
not
marry
me
the
laws
forbid
it
forbid
it
there
is
a
gulf
between
us
as
wide
as
your
love
as
deep
as
my
despair
but
o
tell
me
say
you
will
pity
me
that
you
will
not
throw
me
from
you
like
a
poisoned
thing
zoe
explain
yourself
your
language
fills
me
with
shapeless
fears
and
what
shall
i
say
i
my
mother
was
no
no
not
her
why
should
i
refer
the
blame
to
her
george
do
you
see
that
hand
you
hold
look
at
these
fingers
do
you
see
the
nails
are
of
a
bluish
tinge
yes
near
the
quick
there
is
a
faint
blue
mark
look
in
my
eyes
is
not
the
same
color
in
the
white
it
is
their
beauty
could
you
see
the
roots
of
my
hair
you
would
see
the
same
dark
fatal
mark
do
you
know
what
that
is
no
that
is
the
ineffaceable
curse
of
cain
of
the
blood
that
feeds
my
heart
one
drop
in
eight
is
black
bright
red
as
the
rest
may
be
that
one
drop
poisons
all
the
flood
those
seven
bright
drops
give
me
love
like
yours
hope
like
yours
ambition
like
yours
life
hung
with
passions
like
on
the
morning
flowers
but
the
one
black
drop
gives
me
despair
for
i
an
unclean
thing
forbidden
by
the
laws
i
an
octoroon
zoe
i
love
you
none
the
less
this
knowledge
brings
no
revolt
to
my
heart
and
i
can
overcome
the
obstacle
but
i
can
not
we
can
leave
this
country
and
go
far
away
where
none
can
know
and
our
mother
she
who
from
infancy
treated
me
with
such
fondness
she
who
as
you
said
had
most
reason
to
spurn
me
can
she
forget
what
i
am
will
she
gladly
see
you
wedded
to
the
child
of
her
husband
slave
no
she
would
revolt
from
it
as
all
but
you
would
and
if
i
consented
to
hear
the
cries
of
my
heart
if
i
did
not
crush
out
my
infant
love
what
would
she
say
to
the
poor
girl
on
whom
she
had
bestowed
so
much
no
no
zoe
must
we
immolate
our
lives
on
her
prejudice
yes
for
i
rather
be
black
than
ungrateful
ah
george
our
race
has
at
least
one
virtue
it
knows
how
to
suffer
each
word
you
utter
makes
my
love
sink
deeper
into
my
heart
and
i
remained
here
to
induce
you
to
offer
that
heart
to
dora
if
you
bid
me
do
so
i
will
obey
you
no
no
if
you
can
not
be
mine
o
let
me
not
blush
when
i
think
of
you
dearest
zoe
george
zoe
they
exit
from
behind
rock
looks
after
she
loves
him
i
felt
it
and
how
she
can
love
that
one
black
drop
of
blood
burns
in
her
veins
and
lights
up
her
heart
like
a
foggy
sun
o
how
i
lapped
up
her
words
like
a
thirsty
bloodhound
i
have
her
if
it
costs
me

i
never

till
the

compels
me
george
i
going
to
say
somethin
that
has
been
chokin
me
for
some
time
i
know
you
excuse
it
thar
miss
dora
that
girl
in
love
with
you
yes
sir
her
eyes
are
out
of
her
head
with
it
now
her
fortune
would
redeem
a
good
part
of
this
estate
why
george
i
never
suspected
this
i
did
aunt
i
confess
but
and
you
hesitated
from
motives
of
delicacy
no
here
the
plan
of
it
george
is
in
love
with
zoe
scudder
george
hold
on
now
things
have
got
so
jammed
in
on
top
of
us
we
ai
got
time
to
put
kid
gloves
on
to
handle
them
he
loves
zoe
and
has
found
out
that
she
loves
him
well
that
all
right
but
as
he
ca
marry
her
and
as
miss
dora
would
jump
at
him
why
did
you
mention
this
before
why
because
i
love
zoe
too
and
i
could
take
that
young
feller
from
her
and
she
jist
living
on
the
sight
of
him
as
i
saw
her
do
and
they
so
happy
in
spite
of
this
yer
misery
around
them
and
they
reproachin
themselves
with
not
feeling
as
they
ought
seen
it
i
tell
you
and
darn
it
ca
you
see
that
been
a
hollowing
me
out
so
i
beg
your
pardon
o
george
my
son
let
me
call
you
i
do
not
speak
for
my
own
sake
nor
for
the
loss
of
the
estate
but
for
the
poor
people
here
they
will
be
sold
divided
and
taken
away
they
have
been
born
here
heaven
has
denied
me
children
so
all
the
strings
of
my
heart
have
grown
around
and
amongst
them
like
the
fibres
and
roots
of
an
old
tree
in
its
native
earth
o
let
all
go
but
save
them
with
them
around
us
if
we
have
not
wealth
we
shall
at
least
have
the
home
that
they
alone
can
make
my
dear
mother
scudder
you
teach
me
what
i
ought
to
do
if
miss
sunnyside
will
accept
me
as
i
am
terrebonne
shall
be
saved
i
will
sell
myself
but
the
slaves
shall
be
protected
yourself
george
is
not
dora
worth
any
man
do
say
that
do
say
that
to
a
man
that
loves
another
gal
he
going
to
do
an
heroic
act
do
spile
it
but
zoe
is
only
an
octoroon
she
won
this
race
agin
the
white
anyhow
it
too
late
now
to
start
her
pedigree
dora
seeing
dora
come
peyton
take
my
arm
hush
the
other
one
she
a
little
too
thoroughbred
too
much
of
the
greyhound
but
the
heart
there
i
believe
scudder
peyton
poor
peyton
miss
sunnyside
permit
me
a
word
a
feeling
of
delicacy
has
suspended
upon
my
lips
an
avowal
which
o
dear
has
he
suddenly
come
to
his
senses
zoe
stops
at
in
a
word
i
have
seen
and
admired
you
he
has
a
strange
way
of
showing
it
european
i
suppose
if
you
would
pardon
the
abruptness
of
the
question
i
would
ask
you
do
you
think
the
sincere
devotion
of
my
life
to
make
yours
happy
would
succeed
well
he
has
the
oddest
way
of
making
love
you
are
silent
peyton
i
presume
you
have
hesitated
to
make
this
avowal
because
you
feared
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
here
your
object
might
be
misconstrued
and
that
your
attention
was
rather
to
my
fortune
than
myself
why
do
he
speak
i
mean
you
feared
i
might
not
give
you
credit
for
sincere
and
pure
feelings
well
you
wrong
me
i
do
think
you
capable
of
anything
else
than
no
i
hesitated
because
an
attachment
i
had
formed
before
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
had
not
altogether
died
out
some
of
those
sirens
of
paris
i
presume
i
shall
endeavor
not
to
be
jealous
of
the
past
perhaps
i
have
no
right
to
be
but
now
that
vagrant
love
is
eh
faded
is
it
not
why
do
you
speak
sir
because
miss
sunnyside
i
have
not
learned
to
lie
good
gracious
who
wants
you
to
i
do
but
i
ca
do
it
no
the
love
i
speak
of
is
not
such
as
you
suppose
it
is
a
passion
that
has
grown
up
here
since
i
arrived
but
it
is
a
hopeless
mad
wild
feeling
that
must
perish
here
since
you
arrived
impossible
you
have
seen
no
one
whom
can
you
mean
me
zoe
you
forgive
him
dora
for
he
knew
no
better
until
i
told
him
dora
you
are
right
he
is
incapable
of
any
but
sincere
and
pure
feelings
so
are
you
he
loves
me
what
of
that
you
know
you
be
jealous
of
a
poor
creature
like
me
if
he
caught
the
fever
were
stung
by
a
snake
or
possessed
of
any
other
poisonous
or
unclean
thing
you
could
pity
tend
love
him
through
it
and
for
your
gentle
care
he
would
love
you
in
return
well
is
he
not
thus
afflicted
now
i
am
his
love
he
loves
an
octoroon
o
zoe
you
break
my
heart
at
college
they
said
i
was
a
fool
i
must
be
at
new
orleans
they
said
she
pretty
very
pretty
but
no
brains
i
afraid
they
must
be
right
i
ca
understand
a
word
of
all
this
dear
dora
try
to
understand
it
with
your
heart
you
love
george
you
love
him
dearly
i
know
it
and
you
deserve
to
be
loved
by
him
he
will
love
you
he
must
his
love
for
me
will
pass
away
it
shall
you
heard
him
say
it
was
hopeless
o
forgive
him
and
me
o
why
did
he
speak
to
me
at
all
then
made
me
cry
then
and
i
hate
you
both
peyton
scudder
pointdexter
i
sorry
to
intrude
but
the
business
i
came
upon
will
excuse
me
here
is
my
nephew
sir
perhaps
i
had
better
go
wal
as
it
consarns
you
perhaps
you
better
had
consarns
zoe
i
do
know
she
may
as
well
hear
the
hull
of
it
go
on
colonel
colonel
pointdexter
the
mortgagee
auctioneer
and
general
agent
pardon
me
madam
but
do
you
know
these
papers
papers
mrs
peyton
yes
sir
they
were
the
free
papers
of
the
girl
zoe
but
they
were
in
my
husband
secretary
how
came
they
in
your
possession
i
i
found
them
and
you
purloined
them
hold
on
you
see
go
on
colonel
the
list
of
your
slaves
is
incomplete
it
wants
one
the
boy
paul
we
know
it
no
sir
you
have
omitted
the
octoroon
girl
zoe
zoe
me
at
the
time
the
judge
executed
those
free
papers
to
his
infant
slave
a
judgment
stood
recorded
against
him
while
that
was
on
record
he
had
no
right
to
make
away
with
his
property
that
judgment
still
exists
under
it
and
others
this
estate
is
sold
those
free
papers
ai
worth
the
sand
that
on
zoe
a
slave
it
is
impossible
it
is
certain
madam
the
judge
was
negligent
and
doubtless
forgot
this
small
formality
but
the
creditors
will
not
claim
the
gal
excuse
me
one
of
the
principal
mortgagees
has
made
the
demand
pointdexter
hold
on
yere
george
peyton
you
sit
down
there
trembling
so
you
fall
down
directly
this
blow
has
staggered
me
some
o
zoe
my
child
do
think
too
hardly
of
your
poor
father
i
shall
do
so
if
you
weep
see
i
calm
calm
as
a
tombstone
and
with
about
as
much
life
i
see
it
in
your
face
it
can
not
be
it
shall
not
be
hold
your
tongue
it
must
be
calm
darn
the
things
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
wo
cover
the
debts
of
the
estate
consarn
those
liverpool
english
fellers
why
could
they
send
something
by
the
last
mail
even
a
letter
promising
something
such
is
the
feeling
round
amongst
the
planters
darn
me
if
i
could
raise
thirty
thousand
on
the
envelope
alone
and
ten
thousand
more
on
the
zoe
they
shall
not
take
you
from
us
while
i
live
do
be
a
fool
they
kill
you
and
then
take
her
just
as
soon
as
stop
old
sunnyside
he
buy
her
that
save
her
no
it
wo
we
have
confessed
to
dora
that
we
love
each
other
how
can
she
then
ask
her
father
to
free
me
what
in
thunder
made
you
do
that
because
it
was
the
truth
and
i
had
rather
be
a
slave
with
a
free
soul
than
remain
free
with
a
slavish
deceitful
heart
my
father
gives
me
freedom
at
least
he
thought
so
may
heaven
bless
him
for
the
thought
bless
him
for
the
happiness
he
spread
around
my
life
you
say
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
will
not
cover
his
debts
let
me
be
sold
then
that
i
may
free
his
name
i
give
him
back
the
liberty
he
bestowed
upon
me
for
i
can
never
repay
him
the
love
he
bore
his
poor
octoroon
child
on
whose
breast
his
last
sigh
was
drawn
into
whose
eyes
he
looked
with
the
last
gaze
of
affection
o
my
husband
i
thank
heaven
you
have
not
lived
to
see
this
day
george

would
be

it
is
here
in
