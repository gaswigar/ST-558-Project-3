the
country
doctor
it
is
a
story
told
to
a
group
of
peasants
by
the
character
of
goguelat
an
who
served
under
napoleon
in
an
infantry
regiment
it
was
later

of
napoleon
napoleonder
from
the
russian
a
collection
of
stories
by
various
authors
this
translation
is
by
ellen
marriage
and
clara
bell
the
napoleon
of
the
people
napoleon
you
see
my
friends
was
born
in
corsica
which
is
a
french
island
warmed
by
the
italian
sun
it
is
like
a
furnace
there
everything
is
scorched
up
and
they
keep
on
killing
each
other
from
father
to
son
for
generations
all
about
nothing
at
all
is
a
notion
they
have
to
begin
at
the
beginning
there
was
something
extraordinary
about
the
thing
from
the
first
it
occurred
to
his
mother
who
was
the
handsomest
woman
of
her
time
and
a
shrewd
soul
to
dedicate
him
to
god
so
that
he
should
escape
all
the
dangers
of
infancy
and
of
his
after
life
for
she
had
dreamed
that
the
world
was
on
fire
on
the
day
he
was
born
it
was
a
prophecy
so
she
asked
god
to
protect
him
on
condition
that
napoleon
should
his
holy
religion
which
had
been
thrown
to
the
ground
just
then
that
was
the
agreement
we
shall
see
what
came
of
it
now
do
you
follow
me
carefully
and
tell
me
whether
what
you
are
about
to
hear
is
natural
it
is
certain
sure
that
only
a
man
who
had
had
imagination
enough
to
make
a
mysterious
compact
would
be
capable
of
going
further
than
anybody
else
and
of
passing
through
volleys
of
and
showers
of
bullets
which
carried
us
off
like
flies
but
which
had
a
respect
for
his
head
i
myself
had
particular
proof
of
that
at
eylau
i
see
him
yet
he
climbs
a
hillock
takes
his
looks
along
our
lines
and
says
that
is
going
on
all
right
one
of
the
deep
fellows
with
a
bunch
of
feathers
in
his
cap
used
to
plague
him
a
good
deal
from
all
accounts
following
him
about
everywhere
even
when
he
was
getting
his
meals
this
fellow
wants
to
do
something
clever
so
as
soon
as
the
emperor
goes
away
he
takes
his
place
oh
swept
away
in
a
moment
and
this
is
the
last
of
the
bunch
of
feathers
you
understand
quite
clearly
that
napoleon
had
undertaken
to
keep
his
secret
to
himself
that
is
why
those
who
accompanied
him
and
even
his
especial
friends
used
to
drop
like
nuts
duroc
bessieres
lannes
men
as
strong
as
bars
of
steel
which
he
cast
into
shape
for
his
own
ends
and
here
is
a
final
proof
that
he
was
the
child
of
god
created
to
be
the
soldier
father
for
no
one
ever
saw
him
as
a
lieutenant
or
a
captain
he
is
a
commandant
straight
off
ah
yes
indeed
he
did
not
look
more
than
but
he
was
an
old
general
ever
since
the
taking
of
toulon
when
he
made
a
beginning
by
showing
the
rest
that
they
knew
nothing
about
handling
cannon
next
thing
he
does
he
tumbles
upon
us
a
little
slip
of
a
of
the
army
of
italy
which
had
neither
bread
nor
ammunition
nor
shoes
nor
clothes
a
wretched
army
as
naked
as
a
worm
friends
he
said
here
we
all
are
together
now
get
it
well
into
your
pates
that
in
a
fortnight
time
from
now
you
will
be
the
victors
and
dressed
in
new
clothes
you
shall
all
have
greatcoats
strong
gaiters
and
famous
pairs
of
shoes
but
my
children
you
will
have
to
march
on
milan
to
take
them
where
all
these
things
are
so
they
marched
the
french
crushed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
held
up
their
heads
again
there
were
thirty
thousand
of
us
tatterdemalions
against
eighty
thousand
swaggerers
of
germans
fine
tall
men
and
well
equipped
i
can
see
them
yet
then
napoleon
who
was
only
bonaparte
in
those
days
breathed
goodness
knows
what
into
us
and
on
we
marched
night
and
day
we
rap
their
knuckles
at
montenotte
we
hurry
on
to
thrash
them
at
rivoli
lodi
arcola
and
millesimo
and
we
never
let
them
go
the
army
came
to
have
a
liking
for
winning
battles
then
napoleon
hems
them
in
on
all
sides
these
german
generals
did
not
know
where
to
hide
themselves
so
as
to
have
a
little
peace
and
comfort
he
drubs
them
soundly
cribs
ten
thousand
of
their
men
at
a
time
by
surrounding
them
with
fifteen
hundred
frenchmen
whom
he
makes
to
spring
up
after
his
fashion
and
at
last
he
takes
their
cannon
victuals
money
ammunition
and
everything
they
have
that
is
worth
taking
he
pitches
them
into
the
water
beats
them
on
the
mountains
snaps
at
them
in
the
air
gobbles
them
up
on
the
earth
and
thrashes
them
everywhere
there
are
the
troops
in
full
feather
again
for
look
you
the
emperor
who
for
that
matter
was
a
wit
soon
sent
for
the
inhabitant
and
told
him
that
he
had
come
there
to
deliver
him
whereupon
the
civilian
finds
us
free
quarters
and
makes
much
of
us
so
do
the
women
who
showed
great
discernment
to
come
to
a
final
end
in
ventose
which
was
at
that
time
what
the
month
of
march
is
now
we
had
been
driven
up
into
a
corner
of
the
des
but
after
the
campaign
lo
and
behold
we
were
the
masters
of
italy
just
as
napoleon
had
prophesied
and
in
the
month
of
march
following
in
one
year
and
in
two
campaigns
he
brings
us
within
sight
of
vienna
we
had
made
a
clean
sweep
of
them
we
had
gobbled
down
three
armies
one
after
another
and
taken
the
conceit
out
of
four
austrian
generals
one
of
them
an
old
man
who
had
white
hair
had
been
roasted
like
a
rat
in
the
straw
before
mantua
the
kings
were
suing
for
mercy
on
their
knees
peace
had
been
won
could
a
mere
mortal
have
done
that
no
god
helped
him
that
is
certain
he
distributed
himself
about
like
the
five
loaves
in
the
gospel
commanded
on
the
battlefield
all
day
and
drew
up
his
plans
at
night
the
sentries
always
saw
him
coming
he
neither
ate
nor
slept
therefore
recognizing
these
prodigies
the
soldier
adopts
him
for
his
father
but
forward
the
other
folk
there
in
paris
seeing
all
this
say
among
themselves
here
is
a
pilgrim
who
appears
to
take
his
instructions
from
heaven
above
he
is
uncommonly
likely
to
lay
a
hand
on
france
we
must
let
him
loose
on
asia
or
america
and
that
perhaps
will
keep
him
quiet
the
same
thing
was
decreed
for
him
as
for
jesus
christ
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
give
him
orders
to
go
on
duty
down
in
egypt
see
his
resemblance
to
the
son
of
god
that
is
not
all
though
he
calls
all
his
about
him
all
those
into
whom
he
had
more
particularly
put
the
devil
and
talks
to
them
in
this
way
my
friends
for
the
time
being
they
are
giving
us
egypt
to
stop
our
mouths
but
we
will
swallow
down
egypt
in
a
brace
of
shakes
just
as
we
swallowed
italy
and
private
soldiers
shall
be
princes
and
shall
have
broad
lands
of
their
own
forward
forward
lads
cry
the
sergeants
so
we
come
to
toulon
on
the
way
to
egypt
whereupon
the
english
put
to
sea
with
all
their
fleet
but
when
we
are
on
board
napoleon
says
to
us
they
will
not
see
us
and
it
is
right
and
proper
that
you
should
know
henceforward
that
your
general
has
a
star
in
the
sky
that
guides
us
and
watches
over
us
so
said
so
done
as
we
sailed
over
the
sea
we
took
malta
by
way
of
an
orange
to
quench
his
thirst
for
victory
for
he
was
a
man
who
must
always
be
doing
something
there
we
are
in
egypt
well
and
good
different
orders
the
egyptians
look
you
are
men
who
ever
since
the
world
has
been
the
world
have
been
in
the
habit
of
having
giants
to
reign
over
them
and
armies
like
swarms
of
ants
because
it
is
a
country
full
of
genii
and
crocodiles
where
they
have
built
up
pyramids
as
big
as
our
mountains
the
fancy
took
them
to
stow
their
kings
under
the
pyramids
so
as
to
keep
them
fresh
a
thing
which
mightily
pleases
them
all
round
out
there
whereupon
as
we
landed
the
little
corporal
said
to
us
my
children
the
country
which
you
are
about
to
conquer
worships
a
lot
of
idols
which
you
must
respect
because
the
frenchman
ought
to
be
on
good
terms
with
all
the
world
and
fight
people
without
giving
annoyance
get
it
well
into
your
heads
to
let
everything
alone
at
first
for
we
shall
have
it
all
by
and
by
and
forward
so
far
so
good
but
all
those
people
had
heard
a
prophecy
of
napoleon
under
the
name
of
a
word
which
in
our
lingo
means
the
sultan
fires
a
shot
and
they
feared
him
like
the
devil
so
the
grand
turk
asia
and
africa
have
recourse
to
magic
and
they
send
a
demon
against
us
named
the
mahdi
who
it
was
thought
had
come
down
from
heaven
on
a
white
charger
which
like
its
master
was
and
the
pair
of
them
lived
on
the
air
of
that
part
of
the
world
there
are
people
who
have
seen
them
but
for
my
part
i
can
not
give
you
any
certain
informations
about
them
they
were
the
divinities
of
arabia
and
of
the
mamelukes
who
wished
their
troopers
to
believe
that
the
mahdi
had
the
power
of
preventing
them
from
dying
in
battle
they
gave
out
that
he
was
an
angel
sent
down
to
wage
war
on
napoleon
and
to
get
back
seal
part
of
their
paraphernalia
which
they
pretended
our
general
had
stolen
you
will
readily
understand
that
we
made
them
cry
peccavi
all
the
same
ah
just
tell
me
now
how
they
came
to
know
about
that
compact
of
napoleon
was
that
natural
they
took
it
into
their
heads
for
certain
that
he
commanded
the
genii
and
that
he
went
from
place
to
place
like
a
bird
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
it
is
a
fact
that
he
was
everywhere
at
length
it
came
about
that
he
carried
off
a
queen
of
theirs
she
was
the
private
property
of
a
mameluke
who
although
he
had
several
more
of
them
flatly
refused
to
strike
a
bargain
though
the
other
offered
all
his
treasures
for
her
and
diamonds
as
big
as
pigeon
eggs
when
things
had
come
to
that
pass
they
could
not
well
be
settled
without
a
good
deal
of
fighting
and
there
was
fighting
enough
for
everybody
and
no
mistake
about
it
then
we
are
drawn
up
before
alexandria
and
again
at
gizeh
and
before
the
pyramids
we
had
to
march
over
the
sands
and
in
the
sun
people
whose
eyes
dazzled
used
to
see
water
that
they
could
not
drink
and
shade
that
made
them
fume
but
we
made
short
work
of
the
mamelukes
as
usual
and
everything
goes
down
before
the
voice
of
napoleon
who
seizes
upper
and
lower
egypt
and
arabia
far
and
wide
till
we
came
to
the
capitals
of
kingdoms
which
no
longer
existed
where
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
statues
of
all
the
devils
in
creation
all
done
to
the
life
and
another
curious
thing
too
any
quantity
of
lizards
a
confounded
country
where
any
one
could
have
as
many
acres
of
land
as
he
wished
for
as
little
as
he
pleased
while
he
was
busy
inland
where
he
meant
to
carry
out
some
wonderful
ideas
of
his
the
english
burn
his
fleet
for
him
in
aboukir
bay
for
they
never
could
do
enough
to
annoy
us
but
napoleon
who
was
respected
east
and
west
and
called
my
son
by
the
pope
and
my
dear
father
by
mahomet
cousin
makes
up
his
mind
to
have
his
revenge
on
england
and
to
take
india
in
exchange
for
his
fleet
he
set
out
to
lead
us
into
asia
by
way
of
the
red
sea
through
a
country
where
there
were
palaces
for
and
nothing
but
gold
and
diamonds
to
pay
the
troops
with
when
the
mahdi
comes
to
an
understanding
with
the
plague
and
sends
it
among
us
to
make
a
break
in
our
victories
halt
then
every
man
files
off
to
that
parade
from
which
no
one
comes
back
on
his
two
feet
the
dying
soldier
can
not
take
acre
into
which
he
forces
an
entrance
three
times
with
a
warrior
impetuous
enthusiasm
the
plague
was
too
strong
for
us
there
was
not
even
time
to
say
your
servant
sir
to
the
plague
every
man
was
down
with
it
napoleon
alone
was
as
fresh
as
a
rose
the
whole
army
saw
him
drinking
in
the
plague
without
it
doing
him
any
harm
whatever
there
now
my
friends
was
that
natural
do
you
think
the
mamelukes
knowing
that
we
were
all
on
the
want
to
stop
our
road
but
it
was
no
use
trying
that
nonsense
with
napoleon
so
he
spoke
to
his
familiars
who
had
tougher
skins
than
the
rest
go
and
clear
the
road
for
me
junot
who
was
his
devoted
friend
and
a
fighter
only
takes
a
thousand
men
and
makes
a
clean
sweep
of
the
pasha
army
which
had
the
impudence
to
bar
our
way
thereupon
back
we
came
to
cairo
our
headquarters
and
now
for
another
story
napoleon
being
out
of
the
country
france
allowed
the
people
in
paris
to
worry
the
life
out
of
her
they
kept
back
the
soldiers
pay
and
all
their
linen
and
clothing
left
them
to
starve
and
expected
them
to
lay
down
law
to
the
universe
without
taking
any
further
trouble
in
the
matter
they
were
idiots
of
the
kind
that
amuse
themselves
with
chattering
instead
of
setting
themselves
to
knead
the
dough
so
our
armies
were
defeated
france
could
not
keep
her
frontiers
the
man
was
not
there
i
say
the
man
look
you
because
that
was
how
they
called
him
but
it
was
stuff
and
nonsense
for
he
had
a
star
of
his
own
and
all
his
other
peculiarities
it
was
the
rest
of
us
that
were
mere
men
he
hears
this
history
of
france
after
his
famous
battle
of
aboukir
where
with
a
single
division
he
routed
the
grand
army
of
the
turks
thousand
strong
and
jostled
more
than
half
of
them
into
the
sea
rrrah
without
losing
more
than
three
hundred
of
his
own
men
that
was
his
last
in
egypt
he
said
to
himself
seeing
that
all
was
lost
down
there
i
know
that
i
am
the
saviour
of
france
and
to
france
i
must
go
but
you
must
clearly
understand
that
the
army
did
not
know
of
his
departure
for
if
they
had
they
would
have
kept
him
there
by
force
to
make
him
emperor
of
the
east
so
there
we
all
are
without
him
and
in
low
spirits
for
he
was
the
life
of
us
he
leaves
kleber
in
command
a
great
watchdog
who
passed
in
his
checks
at
cairo
murdered
by
an
egyptian
whom
they
put
to
death
by
spiking
him
with
a
bayonet
which
is
their
way
of
guillotining
people
out
there
but
he
suffered
so
much
that
a
soldier
took
pity
on
the
scoundrel
and
handed
his
flask
to
him
and
the
egyptian
turned
up
his
eyes
then
and
there
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
but
there
is
not
much
fun
for
us
about
this
little
affair
napoleon
steps
aboard
of
a
little
cockleshell
a
mere
nothing
of
a
skiff
called
the
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
english
who
were
blockading
the
place
with
vessels
of
the
line
and
cruisers
and
everything
that
carries
canvas
he
lands
in
france
for
he
always
had
the
faculty
of
taking
the
sea
at
a
stride
was
that
natural
bah
as
soon
as
he
landed
at
frejus
it
is
as
good
as
saying
that
he
has
set
foot
in
paris
everybody
there
worships
him
but
he
calls
the
government
together
what
have
you
done
to
my
children
the
soldiers
he
says
to
the
lawyers
you
are
a
set
of
who
make
fools
of
other
people
and
feather
your
own
nests
at
the
expense
of
france
it
will
not
do
i
speak
in
the
name
of
every
one
who
is
discontented
thereupon
they
want
to
put
him
off
and
to
get
rid
of
him
but
not
a
bit
of
it
he
locks
them
up
in
the
barracks
where
they
used
to
argufy
and
makes
them
jump
out
of
the
windows
then
he
makes
them
follow
in
his
train
and
they
all
become
as
mute
as
fishes
and
supple
as
tobacco
pouches
so
he
becomes
consul
at
a
blow
he
was
not
the
man
to
doubt
the
existence
of
the
supreme
being
he
kept
his
word
with
providence
who
had
kept
his
promise
in
earnest
he
sets
up
religion
again
and
gives
back
the
churches
and
they
ring
the
bells
for
god
and
napoleon
so
every
one
is
satisfied
the
priests
with
whom
he
allows
no
one
to
meddle
the
merchant
folk
who
carry
on
their
trades
without
fear
of
the
of
the
law
that
had
pressed
too
heavily
on
them
the
nobles
for
people
had
fallen
into
an
unfortunate
habit
of
putting
them
to
death
and
he
puts
a
stop
to
this
but
there
were
enemies
to
be
cleared
out
of
the
way
and
he
was
not
the
one
to
go
to
sleep
after
mess
and
his
eyes
look
you
traveled
all
over
the
world
as
if
it
had
been
a
man
face
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
turn
up
in
italy
it
was
just
as
if
he
had
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
the
sight
of
him
was
enough
they
gulp
down
the
austrians
at
marengo
like
a
whale
swallowing
gudgeons
the
french
victories
blew
their
trumpets
so
loud
that
the
whole
world
could
hear
the
noise
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
we
will
not
keep
on
at
this
game
any
longer
say
the
germans
that
is
enough
of
this
sort
of
thing
say
the
others
here
is
the
upshot
europe
shows
the
white
feather
england
knuckles
under
general
peace
all
round
and
kings
and
peoples
pretending
to
embrace
each
other
while
then
and
there
the
emperor
hits
on
the
idea
of
the
legion
of
honor
there
a
fine
thing
if
you
like
he
spoke
to
the
whole
army
at
boulogne
in
france
so
he
said
every
man
is
brave
so
the
civilian
who
does
gloriously
shall
be
the
sister
the
soldier
shall
be
his
brother
and
both
shall
stand
together
beneath
the
flag
of
honor
by
the
time
that
the
rest
of
us
who
were
away
down
there
in
egypt
had
come
back
again
everything
was
changed
we
had
seen
him
last
as
a
general
and
in
no
time
we
find
that
he
is
emperor
and
when
this
was
settled
and
it
may
safely
be
said
that
every
one
was
satisfied
there
was
a
holy
ceremony
such
as
was
never
seen
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
faith
france
gave
herself
to
him
like
a
handsome
girl
to
a
lancer
and
the
pope
and
all
his
cardinals
in
robes
of
red
and
gold
come
across
the
alps
on
purpose
to
anoint
him
before
the
army
and
the
people
who
clap
their
hands
there
is
one
thing
that
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
keep
back
from
you
while
he
was
in
egypt
in
the
desert
not
far
away
from
syria
red
had
appeared
to
him
on
the
mountain
of
moses
in
order
to
say
everything
is
going
on
well
then
again
on
the
eve
of
victory
at
marengo
the
red
man
springs
to
his
feet
in
front
of
the
emperor
for
the
second
time
and
says
to
him
you
shall
see
the
world
at
your
feet
you
shall
be
emperor
of
the
french
king
of
italy
master
of
holland
ruler
of
spain
portugal
and
the
illyrian
provinces
protector
of
germany
saviour
of
poland
first
eagle
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
all
the
rest
of
it
that
red
man
look
you
was
a
notion
of
his
own
who
ran
on
errands
and
carried
messages
so
many
people
say
between
him
and
his
star
i
myself
have
never
believed
that
but
the
red
man
is
undoubtedly
a
fact
napoleon
himself
spoke
of
the
red
man
who
lived
up
in
the
roof
of
the
tuileries
and
who
used
to
come
to
him
he
said
in
moments
of
trouble
and
difficulty
so
on
the
night
after
his
coronation
napoleon
saw
him
for
the
third
time
and
they
talked
over
a
lot
of
things
together
then
the
emperor
goes
straight
to
milan
to
have
himself
crowned
king
of
italy
and
then
came
the
real
triumph
of
the
soldier
for
every
one
who
could
write
became
an
officer
forthwith
and
pensions
and
gifts
of
duchies
poured
down
in
showers
there
were
fortunes
for
the
staff
that
never
cost
france
a
penny
and
the
legion
of
honor
was
as
good
as
an
annuity
for
the
rank
and
file
i
still
draw
my
pension
on
the
strength
of
it
in
short
here
were
armies
provided
for
in
a
way
that
had
never
been
seen
before
but
the
emperor
who
knew
that
he
was
to
be
emperor
over
everybody
and
not
only
over
the
army
bethinks
himself
of
the
bourgeois
and
sets
them
to
build
fairy
monuments
in
places
that
had
been
as
bare
as
the
back
of
my
hand
till
then
suppose
now
that
you
are
coming
out
of
spain
and
on
the
way
to
berlin
well
you
would
see
triumphal
arches
and
in
the
sculpture
upon
them
the
common
soldiers
are
done
every
bit
as
beautifully
as
the
generals
in
two
or
three
years
napoleon
fills
his
cellars
with
gold
makes
bridges
palaces
roads
scholars
festivals
laws
fleets
and
harbors
he
spends
millions
on
millions
ever
so
much
and
ever
so
much
more
to
it
so
that
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
could
have
paved
the
whole
of
france
with
pieces
if
the
fancy
had
taken
him
and
all
this
without
putting
any
taxes
on
you
people
here
so
when
he
was
comfortably
seated
on
his
throne
and
so
thoroughly
the
master
of
the
situation
that
all
europe
was
waiting
for
leave
to
do
anything
for
him
that
he
might
happen
to
want
as
he
had
four
brothers
and
three
sisters
he
said
to
us
just
as
it
might
be
by
way
of
conversation
in
the
order
of
the
day
children
is
it
fitting
that
your
emperor
relations
should
beg
their
bread
no
i
want
them
all
to
be
luminaries
like
me
in
fact
therefore
it
is
urgently
necessary
to
conquer
a
kingdom
for
each
one
of
them
so
that
the
french
nation
may
be
masters
everywhere
so
that
the
guard
may
make
the
whole
earth
tremble
and
france
may
spit
wherever
she
likes
and
every
nation
shall
say
to
her
as
it
is
written
on
my
coins
protects
you
all
right
answers
the
army
we
will
fish
up
kingdoms
for
you
with
the
bayonet
ah
there
was
no
backing
out
of
it
look
you
if
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
conquer
the
moon
we
should
have
had
to
put
everything
in
train
pack
our
knapsacks
and
scramble
up
luckily
he
had
no
wish
for
that
excursion
the
kings
who
were
used
to
the
comforts
of
a
throne
of
course
objected
to
be
lugged
off
so
we
had
marching
orders
we
march
we
get
there
and
the
earth
begins
to
shake
to
its
centre
again
what
times
they
were
for
wearing
out
men
and
and
the
hard
knocks
that
they
gave
us
only
frenchmen
could
have
stood
it
but
you
are
not
ignorant
that
a
frenchman
is
a
born
philosopher
he
knows
that
he
must
die
a
little
sooner
or
a
litter
later
so
we
used
to
die
without
a
word
because
we
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
emperor
do
on
the
maps
here
the
soldier
swung
quickly
round
on
one
foot
so
as
to
trace
a
circle
on
the
barn
floor
with
the
other
there
that
shall
be
a
kingdom
he
used
to
say
and
it
was
a
kingdom
what
fine
times
they
were
colonels
became
generals
whilst
you
were
looking
at
them
generals
became
marshals
of
france
and
marshals
became
kings
there
is
one
of
them
still
left
on
his
feet
to
keep
europe
in
mind
of
those
days
gascon
though
he
may
be
and
a
traitor
to
france
that
he
might
keep
his
crown
and
he
did
not
blush
for
his
shame
for
after
all
a
crown
look
you
is
made
of
gold
the
very
sappers
and
miners
who
knew
how
to
read
became
great
nobles
in
the
same
way
and
i
who
am
telling
you
all
this
have
seen
in
paris
eleven
kings
and
a
crowd
of
princes
all
round
about
napoleon
like
rays
about
the
sun
keep
this
well
in
your
minds
that
as
every
soldier
stood
a
chance
of
having
a
throne
of
his
own
provided
he
showed
himself
worthy
of
it
a
corporal
of
the
guard
was
by
way
of
being
a
sight
to
see
and
they
gaped
at
him
as
he
went
by
for
every
one
came
by
his
share
after
a
victory
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
in
the
bulletin
and
what
battles
they
were
austerlitz
where
the
army
was
manoeuvred
as
if
it
had
been
a
review
eylau
where
the
russians
were
drowned
in
a
lake
just
as
if
napoleon
had
breathed
on
them
and
blown
them
in
wagram
where
the
fighting
was
kept
up
for
three
whole
days
without
flinching
in
short
there
were
as
many
battles
as
there
are
saints
in
the
calendar
then
it
was
made
clear
beyond
a
doubt
that
napoleon
bore
the
sword
of
god
in
his
scabbard
he
had
a
regard
for
the
soldier
he
took
the
soldier
for
his
child
he
was
anxious
that
you
should
have
shoes
shirts
greatcoats
bread
and
cartridges
but
he
kept
up
his
majesty
too
for
reigning
was
his
own
particular
occupation
but
all
the
same
a
sergeant
or
even
a
common
soldier
could
go
up
to
him
and
call
him
emperor
just
as
you
might
say
my
good
friend
to
me
at
times
and
he
would
give
an
answer
to
anything
you
put
before
him
he
used
to
sleep
on
the
snow
just
like
the
rest
of
us
in
short
he
looked
almost
like
an
ordinary
man
but
i
who
am
telling
you
all
these
things
have
seen
him
myself
with
the
whizzing
about
his
ears
no
more
put
out
by
it
than
you
are
at
this
moment
never
moving
a
limb
watching
through
his
always
looking
after
his
business
so
we
stood
our
ground
likewise
as
cool
and
calm
as
john
the
baptist
i
do
not
know
how
he
did
it
but
whenever
he
spoke
a
something
in
his
words
made
our
hearts
burn
within
us
and
just
to
let
him
see
that
we
were
his
children
and
that
it
was
not
in
us
to
shirk
or
flinch
we
used
to
walk
just
as
usual
right
up
to
the
sluts
of
cannon
that
were
belching
smoke
and
vomiting
battalions
of
balls
and
never
a
man
would
so
much
as
say
look
out
it
was
a
something
that
made
dying
men
raise
their
heads
to
salute
him
and
cry
long
live
the
emperor
was
that
natural
would
you
have
done
this
for
a
mere
man
thereupon
having
fitted
up
all
his
family
and
things
having
so
turned
out
that
the
empress
josephine
a
good
woman
for
all
that
had
no
children
he
was
obliged
to
part
company
with
her
although
he
loved
her
not
a
little
but
he
must
have
children
for
reasons
of
state
all
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
when
they
heard
of
his
difficulty
squabbled
among
themselves
as
to
who
should
find
him
a
wife
he
married
an
austrian
princess
so
they
say
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
caesars
a
man
of
antiquity
whom
everybody
talks
about
not
only
in
our
country
where
it
is
said
that
most
things
were
his
doing
but
also
all
over
europe
and
so
certain
sure
is
that
that
i
who
am
talking
to
you
have
been
myself
across
the
danube
where
i
saw
the
ruins
of
a
bridge
built
by
that
man
and
it
appeared
that
he
was
some
connection
of
at
rome
for
the
emperor
claimed
succession
there
for
his
son
so
after
his
wedding
which
was
a
holiday
for
the
whole
world
and
when
they
let
the
people
off
their
taxes
for
ten
years
to
come
though
they
had
to
pay
them
just
the
same
after
all
because
the
excisemen
took
no
notice
of
the
proclamation
after
his
wedding
i
say
his
wife
had
a
child
who
was
king
of
rome
a
child
was
born
a
king
while
his
father
was
alive
a
thing
that
had
never
been
seen
in
the
world
before
that
day
a
balloon
set
out
from
paris
to
carry
the
news
to
rome
and
went
all
the
way
in
one
day
there
now
is
there
one
of
you
who
will
stand
me
out
that
there
was
nothing
supernatural
in
that
no
it
was
decreed
on
high
and
the
mischief
take
those
who
will
not
allow
that
it
was
wafted
over
by
god
himself
so
as
to
add
to
the
honor
and
glory
of
france
but
there
was
the
emperor
of
russia
a
friend
of
our
emperor
who
was
put
out
because
he
had
not
married
a
russian
lady
so
the
russian
backs
up
our
enemies
the
english
for
there
had
always
been
something
to
prevent
napoleon
from
putting
a
spoke
in
their
wheel
clearly
an
end
must
be
made
of
fowl
of
that
feather
napoleon
is
vexed
and
he
says
to
us
soldiers
you
have
been
the
masters
of
every
capital
in
europe
except
moscow
which
is
allied
to
england
so
in
order
to
conquer
london
and
india
which
belongs
to
them
in
london
i
find
it
absolutely
necessary
that
we
go
to
moscow
thereupon
the
greatest
army
that
ever
wore
gaiters
and
left
its
footprints
all
over
the
globe
is
brought
together
and
drawn
up
with
such
peculiar
cleverness
that
the
emperor
passed
a
million
men
in
review
all
in
a
single
day
hourra
cry
the
russians
and
there
is
all
russia
assembled
a
lot
of
brutes
of
cossacks
that
you
never
can
come
up
with
it
was
country
against
country
a
general
stramash
we
had
to
look
out
for
ourselves
it
was
all
asia
against
europe
as
the
red
man
had
said
to
napoleon
all
right
napoleon
had
answered
i
shall
be
ready
for
them
and
there
in
fact
were
all
the
kings
who
came
to
lick
napoleon
hand
austria
prussia
bavaria
saxony
poland
and
italy
all
speaking
us
fair
and
going
along
with
us
it
was
a
fine
thing
the
eagles
had
never
cooed
before
as
they
did
on
parade
in
those
days
when
they
were
reared
above
all
the
flags
of
all
the
nations
of
europe
the
poles
could
not
contain
their
joy
because
the
emperor
had
a
notion
of
setting
up
their
kingdom
again
and
ever
since
poland
and
france
have
always
been
like
brothers
in
short
the
army
shouts
russia
shall
be
ours
we
cross
the
frontiers
all
the
lot
of
us
we
march
and
better
march
but
never
a
russian
do
we
see
at
last
all
our
are
encamped
at
borodino
that
was
where
i
received
the
cross
and
there
is
no
denying
that
it
was
a
cursed
battle
the
emperor
was
not
easy
in
his
mind
he
had
seen
the
red
man
who
said
to
him
my
child
you
are
going
a
little
too
fast
for
your
feet
you
will
run
short
of
men
and
your
friends
will
play
you
false
thereupon
the
emperor
proposes
a
treaty
but
before
he
signs
it
he
says
to
us
let
us
give
these
russians
a
drubbing
all
right
cried
the
army
forward
say
the
sergeants
my
clothes
were
all
falling
to
pieces
my
shoes
were
worn
out
with
trapezing
over
those
roads
out
there
which
are
not
good
going
at
all
but
it
is
all
one
since
here
is
the
last
of
the
row
said
i
to
myself
i
mean
to
get
all
i
can
out
of
it
we
were
posted
before
the
great
ravine
we
had
seats
in
the
front
row
the
signal
is
given
and
seven
hundred
guns
begin
a
conversation
fit
to
make
the
blood
spirt
from
your
ears
one
should
give
the
devil
his
due
and
the
russians
let
themselves
be
cut
in
pieces
just
like
frenchmen
they
did
not
give
way
and
we
made
no
advance
forward
is
the
cry
here
is
the
emperor
so
it
was
he
rides
past
us
at
a
gallop
and
makes
a
sign
to
us
that
a
great
deal
depends
on
our
carrying
the
redoubt
he
puts
fresh
heart
into
us
we
rush
forward
i
am
the
first
man
to
reach
the
gorge
ah
how
they
fell
colonels
lieutenants
and
common
soldiers
all
alike
there
were
shoes
to
fit
up
those
who
had
none
and
epaulettes
for
the
knowing
fellows
that
knew
how
to
write
victory
is
the
cry
all
along
the
line
and
upon
my
word
there
were
thousand
frenchmen
lying
on
the
field
no
more
i
assure
you
such
a
thing
was
never
seen
before
it
was
just
like
a
field
when
the
corn
is
cut
with
a
man
lying
there
for
every
ear
of
corn
that
sobered
the
rest
of
us
the
man
comes
and
we
make
a
circle
round
about
him
and
he
coaxes
us
round
for
he
could
be
very
nice
when
he
chose
and
persuades
us
to
dine
with
duke
humphrey
when
we
were
hungry
as
hunters
then
our
consoler
distributes
the
crosses
of
the
legion
of
honor
himself
salutes
the
dead
and
says
to
us
on
to
moscow
to
moscow
so
be
it
says
the
army
we
take
moscow
what
do
the
russians
do
but
set
fire
to
their
city
there
was
a
blaze
two
leagues
of
bonfire
that
burned
for
two
days
the
buildings
fell
about
our
ears
like
slates
and
molten
lead
and
iron
came
down
in
showers
it
was
really
horrible
it
was
a
light
to
see
our
sorrows
by
i
can
tell
you
the
emperor
said
there
that
is
enough
of
this
sort
of
thing
all
my
men
shall
stay
here
we
amuse
ourselves
for
a
bit
by
recruiting
and
repairing
our
frames
for
we
really
were
much
fatigued
by
the
campaign
we
take
away
with
us
a
gold
cross
from
the
top
of
the
kremlin
and
every
soldier
had
a
little
fortune
but
on
the
way
back
the
winter
came
down
on
us
a
month
earlier
than
usual
a
matter
which
the
learned
like
a
set
of
fools
have
never
sufficiently
explained
and
we
are
nipped
with
the
cold
we
were
no
longer
an
army
after
that
do
you
understand
there
was
an
end
of
generals
and
even
of
the
sergeants
hunger
and
misery
took
the
command
instead
and
all
of
us
were
absolutely
equal
under
their
reign
all
we
thought
of
was
how
to
get
back
to
france
no
one
stooped
to
pick
up
his
gun
or
his
money
every
one
walked
straight
before
him
and
armed
himself
as
he
thought
fit
and
no
one
cared
about
glory
the
emperor
saw
nothing
of
his
star
all
the
time
for
the
weather
was
so
bad
there
was
some
misunderstanding
between
him
and
heaven
poor
man
how
bad
he
felt
when
he
saw
his
eagles
flying
with
their
backs
turned
on
victory
that
was
really
too
rough
well
the
next
thing
is
the
beresina
and
here
and
now
my
friends
any
one
can
assure
you
on
his
honor
and
by
all
that
is
sacred
that
no
never
since
there
have
been
men
on
earth
never
in
this
world
has
there
been
such
a
fricasse
of
an
army
caissons
transports
artillery
and
all
in
such
snow
as
that
and
under
such
a
pitiless
sky
it
was
so
cold
that
you
burned
your
hand
on
the
barrel
of
your
gun
if
you
happened
to
touch
it
there
it
was
that
the
pontooners
saved
the
army
for
the
pontooners
stood
firm
at
their
posts
it
was
there
that
gondrin
behaved
like
a
hero
and
he
is
the
sole
survivor
of
all
the
men
who
were
dogged
enough
to
stand
in
the
river
so
as
to
build
the
bridges
on
which
the
army
crossed
over
and
so
escaped
the
russians
who
still
respected
the
grand
army
on
account
of
its
past
victories
and
gondrin
is
an
accomplished
soldier
pointing
at
gondrin
who
was
gazing
at
him
with
the
rapt
attention
peculiar
to
deaf
people
a
distinguished
soldier
who
deserves
to
have
your
very
highest
esteem
i
saw
the
emperor
standing
by
the
bridge
and
never
feeling
the
cold
at
all
was
that
again
a
natural
thing
he
was
looking
on
at
the
loss
of
his
treasures
of
his
friends
and
those
who
had
fought
with
him
in
egypt
bah
there
was
an
end
of
everything
women
and
wagons
and
guns
were
all
engulfed
and
swallowed
up
everything
went
to
wreck
and
ruin
a
few
of
the
bravest
among
us
saved
the
eagles
for
the
eagles
look
you
meant
france
and
all
the
rest
of
you
it
was
the
civil
and
military
honor
of
france
that
was
in
our
keeping
there
must
be
no
spot
on
the
honor
of
france
and
the
cold
could
never
make
her
bow
her
head
there
was
no
getting
warm
except
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
emperor
for
whenever
he
was
in
danger
we
hurried
up
all
frozen
as
we
were
we
who
would
not
stop
to
hold
out
a
hand
to
a
fallen
friend
they
say
too
that
he
shed
tears
of
a
night
over
his
poor
family
of
soldiers
only
he
and
frenchmen
could
have
pulled
themselves
out
of
such
a
plight
but
we
did
pull
ourselves
out
though
as
i
am
telling
you
it
was
with
loss
ay
and
heavy
loss
the
allies
had
eaten
up
all
our
provisions
everybody
began
to
betray
him
just
as
the
red
man
had
foretold
the
in
paris
who
had
kept
quiet
ever
since
the
imperial
guard
had
been
established
think
that
is
dead
and
hatch
a
conspiracy
they
set
to
work
in
the
home
office
to
overturn
the
emperor
these
things
come
to
his
knowledge
and
worry
him
he
says
to
us
at
parting
children
keep
to
your
posts
i
will
come
back
again
bah
those
generals
of
his
lose
their
heads
at
once
for
when
he
was
away
it
was
not
like
the
same
thing
the
marshals
fall
out
among
themselves
and
make
blunders
as
was
only
natural
for
napoleon
in
his
kindness
had
fed
them
on
gold
till
they
had
grown
as
fat
as
butter
and
they
had
no
mind
to
march
troubles
came
of
this
for
many
of
them
stayed
inactive
in
garrison
towns
in
the
rear
without
attempting
to
tickle
up
the
backs
of
the
enemy
behind
us
and
we
were
being
driven
back
on
france
but
napoleon
comes
back
among
us
with
fresh
troops
conscripts
they
were
and
famous
conscripts
too
he
had
put
some
thorough
notions
of
discipline
into
them
the
whelps
were
good
to
set
their
teeth
in
anybody
he
had
a
bourgeois
guard
of
honor
too
and
fine
troops
they
were
they
melted
away
like
butter
on
a
gridiron
we
may
put
a
bold
front
on
it
but
everything
is
against
us
although
the
army
still
performs
prodigies
of
valor
whole
nations
fought
against
nations
in
tremendous
battles
at
dresden
lutzen
and
bautzen
and
then
it
was
that
france
showed
extraordinary
heroism
for
you
must
all
of
you
bear
in
mind
that
in
those
times
a
stout
grenadier
only
lasted
six
months
we
always
won
the
day
but
the
english
were
always
on
our
track
putting
nonsense
into
other
nations
heads
and
stirring
them
up
to
revolt
in
short
we
cleared
a
way
through
all
these
mobs
of
nations
for
wherever
the
emperor
appeared
we
made
a
passage
for
him
for
on
the
land
as
on
the
sea
whenever
he
said
i
wish
to
go
forward
we
made
the
way
there
comes
a
final
end
to
it
at
last
we
are
back
in
france
and
in
spite
of
the
bitter
weather
it
did
one
heart
good
to
breathe
native
air
again
it
set
up
many
a
poor
fellow
and
as
for
me
it
put
new
life
into
me
i
can
tell
you
but
it
was
a
question
all
at
once
of
defending
france
our
fair
land
of
france
all
europe
was
up
in
arms
against
us
they
took
it
in
bad
part
that
we
had
tried
to
keep
the
russians
in
order
by
driving
them
back
within
their
own
borders
so
that
they
should
not
gobble
us
up
for
those
northern
folk
have
a
strong
liking
for
eating
up
the
men
of
the
south
it
is
a
habit
they
have
i
have
heard
the
same
thing
of
them
from
several
generals
so
the
emperor
finds
his
own
his
friends
whom
he
had
made
crowned
kings
and
the
rabble
of
princes
to
whom
he
had
given
back
their
thrones
were
all
against
him
even
frenchmen
and
allies
in
our
own
ranks
turned
against
us
by
orders
from
high
quarters
as
at
leipsic
common
soldiers
would
hardly
be
capable
of
such
abominations
yet
these
princes
as
they
called
themselves
broke
their
words
three
times
a
day
the
next
thing
they
do
is
to
invade
france
wherever
our
emperor
shows
his
lion
face
the
enemy
beats
a
retreat
he
worked
more
miracles
for
the
defence
of
france
than
he
had
ever
wrought
in
the
conquest
of
italy
the
east
spain
europe
and
russia
he
has
a
mind
to
bury
every
foreigner
in
french
soil
to
give
them
a
respect
for
france
so
he
lets
them
come
close
up
to
paris
so
as
to
do
for
them
at
a
single
blow
and
to
rise
to
the
highest
height
of
genius
in
the
biggest
battle
that
ever
was
fought
a
mother
of
battles
but
the
parisians
wanting
to
save
their
trumpery
skins
and
afraid
for
their
twopenny
shops
open
their
gates
and
there
is
a
beginning
of
the
and
an
end
of
all
joy
and
happiness
they
make
a
fool
of
the
empress
and
fly
the
white
flag
out
at
the
windows
the
emperor
closest
friends
among
his
generals
forsake
him
at
last
and
go
over
to
the
bourbons
of
whom
no
one
had
ever
heard
tell
then
he
bids
us
farewell
at
fontainebleau
soldiers
i
can
hear
him
yet
we
were
all
crying
just
like
children
the
eagles
and
the
flags
had
been
lowered
as
if
for
a
funeral
ah
and
it
was
a
funeral
i
can
tell
you
it
was
the
funeral
of
the
empire
those
smart
armies
of
his
were
nothing
but
skeletons
now
so
he
stood
there
on
the
flight
of
steps
before
his
chateau
and
he
said
children
we
have
been
overcome
by
treachery
but
we
shall
meet
again
up
above
in
the
country
of
the
brave
protect
my
child
i
leave
him
in
your
care
live
napoleon
he
had
thought
of
killing
himself
so
that
no
one
should
behold
napoleon
after
his
defeat
like
jesus
christ
before
the
crucifixion
he
thought
himself
forsaken
by
god
and
by
his
talisman
and
so
he
took
enough
poison
to
kill
a
regiment
but
it
had
no
effect
whatever
upon
him
another
marvel
he
discovered
that
he
was
immortal
and
feeling
sure
of
his
case
and
knowing
that
he
would
be
emperor
for
ever
he
went
to
an
island
for
a
little
while
so
as
to
study
the
dispositions
of
those
folk
who
did
not
fail
to
make
blunder
upon
blunder
whilst
he
was
biding
his
time
the
chinese
and
the
brutes
out
in
africa
the
moors
and
awkward
customers
all
of
them
were
so
convinced
that
he
was
something
more
than
mortal
that
they
respected
his
flag
saying
that
god
would
be
displeased
if
any
one
meddled
with
it
so
he
reigned
over
all
the
rest
of
the
world
although
the
doors
of
his
own
france
had
been
closed
upon
him
then
he
goes
on
board
the
same
nutshell
of
a
skiff
that
he
sailed
in
from
egypt
passes
under
the
noses
of
the
english
vessels
and
sets
foot
in
france
france
recognizes
her
emperor
the
cuckoo
flits
from
steeple
to
steeple
france
cries
with
one
voice
long
live
the
emperor
the
enthusiasm
for
that
wonder
of
the
ages
was
thoroughly
genuine
in
these
parts
dauphine
behaved
handsomely
and
i
was
uncommonly
pleased
to
learn
that
people
here
shed
tears
of
joy
on
seeing
his
gray
overcoat
once
more
it
was
on
march
that
napoleon
set
out
with
two
hundred
men
to
conquer
the
kingdom
of
france
and
navarre
which
by
march
had
become
the
french
empire
again
on
that
day
he
found
himself
in
paris
and
a
clean
sweep
had
been
made
of
everything
he
had
won
back
his
beloved
france
and
had
called
all
his
soldiers
about
him
again
and
three
words
of
his
had
done
it
all
here
am
i
was
the
greatest
miracle
god
ever
worked
was
it
ever
known
in
the
world
before
that
a
man
should
do
nothing
but
show
his
hat
and
a
whole
empire
became
his
they
fancied
that
france
was
crushed
did
they
never
a
bit
of
it
a
national
army
springs
up
again
at
the
sight
of
the
eagle
and
we
all
march
to
waterloo
there
the
guard
fall
all
as
one
man
napoleon
in
his
despair
heads
the
rest
and
flings
himself
three
times
on
the
guns
without
finding
the
death
he
sought
we
all
saw
him
do
it
we
soldiers
and
the
day
was
lost
that
night
the
emperor
calls
all
his
old
soldiers
about
him
and
there
on
the
battlefield
which
was
soaked
with
our
blood
he
burns
his
flags
and
his
eagles
the
poor
eagles
that
had
never
been
defeated
that
had
cried
forward
in
battle
after
battle
and
had
flown
above
us
all
over
europe
that
was
the
end
of
the
eagles
all
the
wealth
of
england
could
not
purchase
for
her
one
the
rest
is
sufficiently
known
the
red
man
went
over
to
the
bourbons
like
the
low
scoundrel
he
is
france
is
prostrate
the
soldier
counts
for
nothing
they
rob
him
of
his
due
send
him
about
his
business
and
fill
his
place
with
nobles
who
could
not
walk
they
were
so
old
so
that
it
made
you
sorry
to
see
them
they
seize
napoleon
by
treachery
the
english
shut
him
up
on
a
desert
island
in
the
ocean
on
a
rock
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
rest
of
the
world
that
is
the
final
end
of
it
there
he
has
to
stop
till
the
red
man
gives
him
back
his
power
again
for
the
happiness
of
france
a
lot
of
them
say
that
he
is
dead
dead
oh
yes
very
likely
they
do
not
know
him
that
is
plain
they
go
on
telling
that
fib
to
deceive
the
people
and
to
keep
things
quiet
for
their
government
listen
this
is
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
his
friends
have
left
him
alone
in
the
desert
to
fulfil
a
prophecy
that
was
made
about
him
for
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
his
name
napoleon
really
means
the
of
the
and
that
is
gospel
truth
you
will
hear
plenty
of
other
things
said
about
the
emperor
but
they
are
all
monstrous
nonsense
because
look
you
to
no
man
of
woman
born
would
god
have
given
the
power
to
write
his
name
in
red
as
he
did
across
the
earth
where
he
will
be
remembered
for
ever
long
live
napoleon
the
father
of
the
soldier
the
father
of
the
people
