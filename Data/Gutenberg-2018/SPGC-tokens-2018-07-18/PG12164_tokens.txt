five
miles
out
the

max
sally
alec
and
robert
climbed
the
five
flights
of
stairs
to
their
small
flat
with
the
agility
of
youth
and
the
impetus
of
high
but
subdued
excitement
uncle
timothy
rudd
following
more
slowly
reached
the
outer
door
of
the
little
suite
of
rooms
in
time
to
hear
what
seemed
to
be
the
first
outburst
well
what
do
you
think
now
acres
the
house
open
the
windows
and
give
us
air
acres
run
to
seed
and
the
house
tumbling
down
about
its
own
ears
a
magnificent
inheritance
that
max
cast
his
hat
upon
a
chair
as
if
he
flung
it
away
with
the
inheritance
but
who
ever
thought
uncle
maxwell
lane
would
ever
leave
his
poor
relations
anything
this
was
sally
five
miles
out
by
road
a
bit
less
by
trolley
let
go
and
see
it
afternoon
thank
goodness
a
half
holiday
is
so
near
anybody
been
by
the
place
lately
i
was
just
the
other
day
on
my
wheel
i
did
think
it
looked
so
awfully
bad
this
was
robert
the
as
uncle
timothy
entered
the
tiny
sally
was
speaking
she
had
thrown
her
black
veil
back
over
her
hat
revealing
masses
of
flaxen
hair
and
deep
blue
eyes
glowing
with
interest
her
delicate
cheeks
were
warmly
flushed
partly
with
excitement
and
partly
because
for
two
hours
now
during
the
journey
from
the
flat
to
the
lawyer
office
the
period
spent
therein
listening
to
the
reading
of
uncle
maxwell
lane
will
and
the
business
appertaining
thereto
and
the
return
trip
home
she
had
worn
the
veil
closely
drawn
her
simple
mourning
was
to
her
a
screen
behind
which
to
shield
herself
from
curious
eyes
always
attracted
by
those
masses
of
singularly
fair
hair
and
the
unusual
contours
of
the
young
face
beneath
i
think
it
a
godsend
if
ever
anything
was
she
was
saying
max
killing
himself
in
the
bank
and
alec
growing
pale
and
grouchy
in
the
office
and
even
bob
she
was
interrupted
by
a
chorus
of
protests
against
her
terms
of
description
i
not
killing
myself
pale
and
grouchy
i
not
a
patch
on
what
the
matter
with
bob
sally
lunn
and
uncle
timmy
continued
sally
undisturbed
by
interpolations
to
which
she
was
quite
accustomed
pining
for
fresh
air
i
walk
in
the
park
every
day
my
dear
uncle
timothy
felt
obliged
to
remind
her
yes
i
know
but
you
lived
in
a
little
city
flat
just
as
long
as
good
for
you
and
you
need
to
be
turned
outdoors
so
do
we
all
oh
boys
and
uncle
timmy
i
just
sat
there
crying
and
smiling
under
my
veil
in
that
dreadful
office
crying
to
think
that
i
cry
for
uncle
maxwell
because
he
was
so
cold
and
queer
to
us
always
and
yet
he
had
given
us
this
property
after
all
and
a
mighty
small
fraction
of
the
estate
it
is
i
hope
you
understand
growled
max
but
sally
went
on
without
minding
everybody
was
used
to
max
growls
and
smiling
because
i
could
help
it
just
to
think
we
had
a
chance
at
last
to
get
out
of
the
city
we
can
do
it
five
miles
by
trolley
is
nothing
for
you
boys
or
for
me
when
i
need
to
come
in
you
not
talking
about
our
going
to
live
out
there
max
tone
was
derisive
why
not
have
you
seen
the
place
lately
not
since
i
was
a
little
girl
but
i
remember
i
thought
it
was
lovely
then
it
is
lovely
now
if
it
ever
was
which
i
doubt
in
the
first
place
it
belongs
to
that
little
suburb
of
wybury
as
commonplace
a
village
as
ever
existed
within
five
miles
of
as
big
a
city
as
this
in
the
second
place
it
as
much
an
abandoned
farm
as
neglect
can
make
a
place
that
was
once
i
suppose
an
aristocratic
sort
of
country
home
the
old
mansion
is
as
big
as
a
barn
and
as
hopeless
you
could
any
more
make
a
home
out
of
it
why
you
could
put
this
whole
apartment
into
the
room
at
the
left
of
the
hall
how
do
you
know
so
much
about
it
demanded
sally
none
of
us
has
been
there
since
aunt
alicia
died
that
was
when
we
were
children
and
uncle
maxwell
used
to
spend
his
summers
there
he
has
spent
them
there
since
she
died
max
asserted
how
do
i
know
so
much
about
it
i
was
down
there
last
summer
with
frank
sustis
his
father
sent
him
out
to
look
the
place
over
with
a
view
to
buying
it
himself
for
a
summer
home
you
should
have
heard
prank
jeer
at
the
idea
while
we
were
going
about
it
makes
no
difference
persisted
sally
removing
her
hat
and
folding
the
veil
with
care
i
want
to
see
it
we
go
out
wo
we
she
appealed
to
her
second
brother
alec
a
young
fellow
of
twenty
who
had
thrown
himself
listlessly
into
a
chair
but
who
was
listening
attentively
to
the
discussion
he
nodded
of
course
you
could
keep
one
of
us
away
even
max
he
would
be
done
out
of
the
pleasure
of
showing
us
over
the
place
and
pointing
out
the
defects
if
by
keeping
still
he
could
own
the
whole
ranch
himself
it
be
jolly
fun
to
go
cried
bob
quickly
he
could
not
bear
sounds
of
disagreement
between
the
members
of
his
family
because
he
knew
sally
did
not
like
it
what
do
you
think
about
the
old
place
uncle
timmy
questioned
sally
presently
she
had
taken
off
her
one
street
suit
and
had
put
on
a
fresh
little
print
in
which
she
was
setting
the
table
for
dinner
all
the
others
except
uncle
timothy
had
gone
out
on
various
errands
well
sally
said
timothy
rudd
thoughtfully
i
do
know
that
i
a
competent
judge
your
uncle
maxwell
place
was
considered
a
fine
one
in
its
day
before
he
made
so
much
money
and
took
to
living
in
town
he
used
to
like
it
there
i
think
though
he
did
say
much
about
it
i
sorry
it
been
allowed
to
run
down
there
was
a
pine
grove
on
it
and
a
splendid
young
apple
orchard
and
a
timber
tract
at
the
back
that
ought
to
be
worth
considerable
money
by
this
time
if
it
has
been
cut
probably
it
has
with
timber
bringing
the
prices
it
does
now
about
the
house
inquired
sally
after
uncle
timothy
had
gone
into
more
or
less
detail
concerning
the
place
itself
i
especially
interested
in
the
house
do
you
think
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
for
us
to
live
there
i
do
know
it
would
be
something
of
a
change
from
this
he
admitted
looking
about
the
little
you
managed
to
make
us
all
pretty
comfortable
here
with
what
there
was
left
of
the
furniture
after
the
sale
i
do
know
how
far
it
would
go
in
maxwell
big
house
pretty
large
that
a
fact
according
to
max
it
in
need
of
a
good
deal
of
repair
of
course
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
should
like
to
live
out
in
the
country
among
the
green
things
as
i
used
to
do
up
in
new
hampshire
it
would
be
good
for
us
all
but
you
can
tell
better
after
you
seen
the
place
again
there
was
no
denying
this
sally
head
was
so
full
of
plans
it
was
difficult
to
wait
until
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
when
everybody
should
be
at
liberty
to
make
the
trip
to
wybury
the
moment
luncheon
was
over
they
started
and
by
two
the
whizzing
out
through
the
suburbs
to
the
open
country
then
following
the
curve
along
the
river
edge
to
pass
through
the
small
settlement
called
wybury
had
deposited
them
in
the
centre
of
that
village
the
maxwell
place
lay
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
river
road
and
the
party
set
off
promptly
to
cover
the
short
distance
it
was
early
april
sunny
and
mild
but
still
rather
damp
under
foot
after
leaving
the
board
sidewalks
of
wybury
there
was
no
accommodation
for
foot
passengers
except
the
path
at
the
side
of
the
road
imagine
tramping
through
this
mud
every
night
and
morning
was
first
contribution
to
the
effort
he
meant
to
make
to
disillusionize
his
romantic
sister
whose
dreams
of
life
in
the
country
he
considered
worse
than
folly
he
turned
up
his
trousers
widely
at
the
bottom
as
he
spoke
it
such
a
little
way
we
could
soon
have
a
better
path
sally
replied
look
there
are
the
chimneys
i
sure
just
beyond
that
grove
of
pines
it
hardly
more
than
five
minutes
walk
from
the
car
five
minutes
through
a
february
blizzard
is
five
minutes
too
much
but
five
minutes
through
a
midsummer
evening
is
an
hour
too
little
sally
gave
him
back
that
pine
grove
belongs
to
the
place
called
back
bob
who
was
considerably
in
advance
of
the
others
sally
in
spite
of
her
eagerness
was
adapting
her
pace
to
the
limitations
of
uncle
timothy
who
at
sixty
could
hardly
be
expected
to
walk
in
competition
with
nineteen
pine
groves
are
worth
something
these
days
said
max
eyeing
the
thick
tops
critically
sally
had
charmed
eyes
for
the
pine
grove
but
she
did
not
look
at
it
long
for
beyond
showed
the
great
she
remembered
from
her
childhood
when
it
had
been
the
happiest
treat
she
knew
to
be
invited
by
aunt
alicia
to
spend
the
day
at
uncle
maxwell
country
place
the
young
lanes
had
all
been
born
and
brought
up
in
the
city
their
home
had
been
one
of
moderate
luxury
until
three
years
before
their
father
had
died
suddenly
leaving
the
mere
remnant
of
an
estate
which
had
been
supposed
to
be
a
large
one
the
shock
and
the
change
from
a
life
of
ease
to
one
of
close
economy
had
weakened
the
always
delicate
constitution
of
the
wife
and
mother
until
a
year
after
her
husband
death
she
had
followed
him
max
had
left
college
at
the
end
of
his
third
year
and
gone
into
the
bank
of
which
his
uncle
maxwell
was
alec
just
ready
for
college
had
reluctantly
resigned
his
purpose
and
taken
a
position
in
the
of
a
firm
of
contractors
friends
of
his
father
even
robert
the
youngest
had
found
something
to
do
the
family
had
sold
the
old
home
to
obtain
money
with
which
to
meet
expenses
until
the
salaries
of
the
workers
should
begin
to
count
and
had
moved
into
the
little
flat
where
the
sister
had
for
a
year
now
done
her
girlish
best
to
make
a
home
for
her
four
men
as
she
called
them
while
she
kept
many
violent
attacks
of
heartache
bravely
hidden
for
the
most
part
under
a
bright
exterior
nobody
knew
how
sally
disliked
the
flat
unless
it
was
bob
who
was
her
closest
confidant
there
your
fine
family
mansion
called
max
pointing
from
the
curve
of
the
road
which
he
had
reached
close
after
bob
sally
stood
still
in
astonished
surprise
could
that
really
be
the
aristocratic
old
place
of
her
memory
max
could
hardly
be
blamed
for
his
derisive
comments
a
noble
house
gone
to
decay
is
a
sight
infinitely
more
depressing
than
that
of
an
humble
one
this
once
had
been
an
imposing
structure
it
looked
now
like
a
relic
of
war
times
look
at
the
tumbling
chimneys
crowed
alec
look
at
the
broken
shutters
swinging
by
one
hinge
see
those
porch
pillars
were
they
ever
white
behold
that
side
entrance
looks
as
if
a
cyclone
had
struck
it
sally
was
silent
even
her
buoyant
hopes
fell
before
the
indisputable
evidence
given
by
her
eyes
it
was
so
big
the
old
place
a
small
house
one
might
hope
to
repair
but
a
large
building
like
this
it
would
cost
more
than
they
would
have
to
spare
in
years
if
the
outside
were
any
indication
of
the
inside
the
situation
was
hopeless
she
followed
alec
in
through
the
gateway
at
the
dilapidated
stone
of
which
max
gave
a
significant
wave
of
the
hand
as
he
passed
an
overgrown
hedge
ran
along
the
entire
front
of
the
place
its
untrimmed
wildness
adding
to
the
general
unkempt
look
as
did
the
sodden
tangled
surface
of
what
had
once
been
a
lawn
the
rank
bunches
of
shrubbery
which
half
hid
the
front
windows
from
sight
and
the
broken
bricks
in
the
old
walk
which
led
beside
a
driveway
from
to
porch
how
did
maxwell
ever
come
to
let
this
place
go
to
seed
like
this
lamented
uncle
timothy
he
must
have
cared
nothing
at
all
for
it
one
would
think
it
was
forty
years
instead
of
only
ten
that
it
had
been
left
to
wind
and
weather
it
a
wonder
that
some
passing
tramp
has
set
fire
to
it
commented
max
searching
in
his
pocket
for
the
key
which
had
been
delivered
to
him
by
sidway
his
uncle
executor
take
a
long
breath
before
i
let
you
in
it
be
musty
and
fusty
enough
to
stifle
you
probably
with
considerable
difficulty
he
turned
the
key
in
the
rusty
lock
and
opened
the
door
which
turned
creakingly
upon
its
long
unused
hinges
but
with
the
first
step
inside
sally
drooping
spirits
leaped
up
again
oh
max
she
cried
what
a
beautiful
old
hall
beautiful
is
it
inquired
max
laughing
contemptuously
well
i
say
i
see
it
looks
just
like
a
barracks
to
me
sniffed
alec
what
air
or
lack
of
it
but
it
beautiful
persisted
sally
in
genuine
enthusiasm
see
how
wide
and
high
sweeping
straight
through
to
that
door
at
the
back
and
see
the
wide
low
staircase
with
the
spindle
railing
and
the
curved
posts
at
the
bottom
see
the
carving
over
the
doors
and
the
fanlight
over
the
outside
ones
and
look
at
that
fireplace
she
dragged
max
by
one
arm
and
uncle
timothy
by
the
other
to
stand
in
front
of
it
halfway
down
the
hall
sharing
one
of
the
great
chimneys
with
another
fireplace
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
was
a
of
fine
old
colonial
design
the
proportions
were
colossal
it
would
take
a
cord
of
wood
to
keep
the
thing
going
an
evening
asserted
max
and
then
nobody
be
warm
unless
he
was
sitting
with
his
head
inside
the
hood
supplemented
alec
but
sally
was
already
off
upon
explorations
she
rushed
into
the
room
upon
the
left
of
the
hall
it
was
a
thirty
feet
long
by
twenty
wide
she
darted
into
the
room
on
the
right
it
was
twenty
feet
square
and
back
of
it
lay
another
of
similar
size
she
could
no
longer
wait
for
her
party
with
their
slow
and
indifferent
following
of
her
but
ran
from
room
to
room
calling
back
injunctions
to
note
special
points
of
interest
bob
kept
close
behind
her
if
he
cared
little
for
old
houses
he
cared
much
for
sally
and
he
liked
to
see
her
eyes
sparkle
and
her
lips
laugh
sally
had
times
of
being
very
sad
and
discouraged
as
no
one
knew
so
well
as
he
and
if
she
could
find
interest
in
this
old
barracks
he
thought
alec
had
struck
the
right
word
he
was
not
the
boy
to
dampen
it
let
skip
up
this
back
staircase
bobby
proposed
sally
as
they
turned
about
from
exploring
the
kitchen
and
i
crazy
to
find
if
there
are
some
smaller
rooms
nice
cozy
ones
you
know
it
ca
be
all
so
big
everywhere
do
you
suppose
the
upstairs
rooms
are
just
the
shape
of
the
lower
ones
suggested
bob
as
they
ran
up
in
front
perhaps
but
not
back
here
there
ought
to
be
some
lovely
rambling
passageways
and
steps
up
and
steps
down
and
rooms
where
you
do
expect
them
and
a
splendid
attic
and
perhaps
a
secret
staircase
bob
what
if
there
should
actually
be
a
secret
staircase
bob
laughed
you
been
reading
spooky
stories
i
suppose
robert
rudd
lane
will
you
behold
that
little
flight
of
five
steps
leading
up
to
that
door
sally
was
down
the
hall
and
up
the
five
steps
in
a
flash
she
would
have
burst
into
the
unknown
region
beyond
but
a
locked
door
barred
her
way
bob
stood
below
and
laughed
at
her
baffled
expression
you
rather
see
through
that
door
than
into
any
other
spot
in
the
house
that
is
locked
up
would
you
sally
lunn
he
commented
knowingly
run
down
to
max
for
the
keys
will
you
dear
she
begged
and
bob
ran
the
others
came
up
max
and
bob
alec
and
even
uncle
timothy
tried
every
key
in
the
bunch
in
vain
sally
attempted
to
peer
through
the
bob
ran
outside
and
returning
reported
that
there
were
no
shutters
in
the
region
opposite
the
probable
position
of
the
door
it
undoubtedly
a
dark
with
a
row
of
empty
shelves
said
max
give
it
up
sally
there
are
places
enough
to
explore
a
regiment
of
infantry
could
be
bivouacked
in
this
second
story
see
the
rooms
and
rooms
inside
of
rooms
oh
come
away
home
cried
alec
impatiently
before
sally
was
half
satisfied
i
going
over
to
the
timber
tract
you
better
come
along
al
let
sally
stay
here
and
plan
her
hotel
maxwell
inn
eh
sally
a
number
on
each
door
and
a
at
each
end
of
the
hall
a
and
two
chambermaids
for
this
floor
in
time
an
elevator
and
a
manicure
shop
and
max
clattered
laughing
away
down
the
front
staircase
the
shallow
steps
of
which
he
took
two
at
a
time
it
is
a
very
cozy
nest
is
it
sis
said
bob
sympathetically
as
sally
after
one
look
into
the
great
square
rooms
over
the
front
closed
the
doors
with
a
bang
at
mention
of
the
timber
tract
uncle
timothy
had
gone
downstairs
after
the
others
they
heard
him
shut
the
front
door
and
from
an
upper
window
saw
him
walking
briskly
away
no
it
is
now
she
admitted
soberly
but
what
a
home
it
could
be
made
it
pretty
near
twice
as
big
as
our
old
one
and
that
was
a
fairly
good
size
we
could
camp
out
in
a
corner
of
it
but
that
would
be
lonesome
do
you
think
so
we
might
keep
summer
boarders
sally
shook
her
head
she
began
to
walk
back
through
the
upper
halls
bob
followed
her
and
they
climbed
the
attic
stairs
finding
a
great
space
above
lighted
by
low
windows
shut
in
by
patterns
of
ironwork
jolly
what
a
place
for
rainy
days
ejaculated
the
boy
moved
to
greater
enthusiasm
than
he
had
felt
anywhere
below
stairs
you
could
have
a
workshop
and
a
gymnasium
and
all
sorts
of
things
you
could
make
it
really
festive
with
a
few
rugs
and
pillows
and
hammocks
and
things
how
the
fellows
i
know
would
like
to
get
up
here
he
lingered
behind
his
sister
who
after
one
comprehensive
look
round
the
big
bare
dusty
place
had
slipped
away
downstairs
again
guarding
her
skirts
carefully
when
bob
after
planning
in
detail
a
possible
and
desirable
arrangement
of
the
attic
reluctantly
descended
he
found
her
at
the
top
of
the
little
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
one
locked
door
look
out
the
family
skeleton
may
be
hidden
behind
that
door
he
called
racing
down
the
hall
or
worse
come
away
fatima
bob
said
sally
regarding
him
from
the
top
of
the
steps
her
cheeks
brightly
flushed
her
eyes
alight
with
interest
i
simply
have
to
know
what
beyond
this
door
what
are
you
expecting
to
find
there
sis
trunks
full
of
gold
family
papers
leaving
all
the
maxwell
lane
estate
to
the
lanes
of
henley
street
she
shook
her
head
with
a
laughing
challenge
wait
till
i
get
a
locksmith
here
she
said
i
wait
and
bob
sat
composedly
down
on
the
bottom
step
grinning
up
at
his
excited
sister
going
to
get
him
out
by
wireless
chapter
ii
everybody
explores
alighting
from
her
mother
carriage
in
front
of
the
winona
apartments
in
henley
street
josephine
burnside
dismissed
her
coachman
and
hurried
eagerly
into
the
florid
vestibule
i
do
see
how
sally
endures
this
sort
of
thing
she
thought
for
the
hundredth
time
since
the
lane
house
near
her
own
in
grosvenor
place
had
been
sold
the
clicked
promptly
in
answer
to
her
ring
and
at
the
top
of
the
third
flight
she
met
sally
i
was
sure
it
was
you
i
so
glad
i
all
alone
was
sally
joyful
welcome
and
the
next
minute
josephine
found
herself
inside
the
small
passage
her
outer
garments
being
forcibly
removed
and
herself
borne
into
the
little
and
established
in
uncle
timothy
reading
chair
which
was
the
most
comfortable
one
in
the
place
sewing
as
usual
what
are
you
making
now
something
lovely
out
of
nothing
at
all
i
suppose
of
course
it
a
convenient
accomplishment
you
did
know
that
four
and
a
half
yards
of
swiss
muslin
would
make
a
whole
frock
did
you
well
it
will
under
some
conditions
and
sally
proudly
held
up
the
work
of
her
hands
a
nearly
finished
product
at
which
her
friend
attired
at
the
moment
in
some
fifteen
yards
of
silk
stared
in
amazement
sally
lunn
you
did
you
could
it
not
skimpy
in
the
least
you
must
have
pieced
out
with
something
else
but
where
the
remains
of
my
old
one
underneath
and
used
where
the
least
wear
will
come
on
it
it
not
an
exact
match
but
i
do
think
it
will
show
show
not
a
bit
but
i
thought
putting
old
and
new
wash
goods
together
would
do
i
shrunk
the
new
and
as
i
told
you
the
old
with
some
very
thin
cheap
lawn
i
shall
wash
it
myself
with
the
ends
of
my
fingers
and
my
eyes
looking
the
other
way
find
the
old
parts
thus
challenged
josephine
brought
a
pair
of
very
bright
black
eyes
to
bear
upon
the
pretty
frock
turning
it
over
critically
and
after
some
search
discovered
the
resourceful
trick
which
had
made
the
whole
lower
half
of
the
skirt
and
part
of
the
sleeves
out
of
the
old
muslin
you
genius
she
cried
i
wish
i
were
half
as
clever
as
you
she
regarded
her
friend
with
the
genuine
admiration
and
affection
which
had
carried
the
comradeship
of
the
two
girls
safely
through
the
test
of
the
lanes
altered
fortunes
how
good
it
is
to
have
you
back
said
sally
returning
the
look
you
have
half
told
me
about
your
winter
yes
but
never
mind
that
just
now
said
josephine
i
come
to
hear
about
you
jarvis
met
max
this
morning
heard
the
news
and
told
it
at
luncheon
i
simply
flew
down
to
show
you
how
glad
i
am
and
to
hear
more
tell
me
is
it
a
beautiful
old
place
and
shall
you
go
there
to
live
i
suppose
i
seen
it
but
i
forgotten
it
a
forlorn
old
place
dreadfully
run
down
but
i
want
to
live
in
it
the
boys
wo
hear
of
it
as
yet
we
only
been
there
once
we
going
again
saturday
you
know
that
the
only
time
they
can
all
get
away
what
fun
ca
i
go
too
there
must
be
something
nice
about
it
or
you
would
want
to
live
there
there
a
locked
door
in
it
said
sally
smiling
as
her
thoughts
turned
to
the
mystery
she
described
the
finding
of
the
door
to
josephine
who
exclaimed
i
must
be
there
to
see
it
opened
what
do
you
suppose
you
find
dust
and
empty
shelves
max
says
murdered
wives
says
bob
alec
guesses
a
lot
of
chairs
and
a
desk
with
the
hinges
off
uncle
timothy
thinks
it
merely
leads
to
the
roof
but
the
steps
from
the
attic
do
that
what
do
think
i
think
everything
admitted
sally
from
antique
mirrors
and
old
clothes
to
empty
flower
pots
and
battered
and
rons
i
prepared
for
anything
except
the
empty
shelves
why
should
the
door
be
locked
so
securely
if
there
nothing
behind
it
why
indeed
i
do
know
why
but
my
imagination
shudders
deliciously
at
the
thought
of
seeing
it
opened
may
i
go
on
saturday
may
jarvis
go
he
wanted
me
to
ask
he
having
a
bad
time
with
his
eyes
again
read
and
pines
for
something
to
do
a
locked
closet
will
interest
him
of
course
you
may
both
go
if
you
get
jarvis
to
promise
not
to
throw
any
cold
water
on
my
schemes
he
not
likely
to
discourage
any
of
your
schemes
you
know
well
enough
has
he
always
taken
your
part
even
against
me
since
we
used
to
quarrel
over
which
should
have
the
shady
side
of
the
sand
pile
wo
hurt
your
gipsy
face
joey
he
say
sally
the
shade
like
a
gentleman
both
girls
laughed
then
sally
grew
sober
seems
to
me
it
only
a
little
while
since
jarvis
had
his
last
siege
with
his
eyes
she
observed
are
they
quite
as
bad
again
he
not
shut
up
in
the
dark
this
time
but
has
to
wear
blue
goggles
in
the
daytime
is
forbidden
reading
and
writing
absolutely
for
weeks
and
goes
to
doctor
meyer
every
other
day
for
treatment
he
getting
as
rampageous
as
a
caged
lion
and
vows
he
go
off
to
the
south
seas
or
labrador
or
some
other
place
where
books
and
libraries
and
literary
work
wo
tantalize
him
he
go
i
believe
if
it
were
for
mother
she
ca
bear
the
idea
it
was
that
last
awful
year
work
at
college
said
sally
regretfully
why
did
he
ever
conceive
the
idea
of
doing
two
years
work
in
one
and
why
did
his
friends
let
him
do
it
i
know
that
what
we
all
say
now
so
does
he
of
course
he
must
go
saturday
tell
him
i
particularly
want
him
that
will
please
him
now
do
tell
me
about
the
whole
place
and
josephine
settled
herself
to
listen
long
before
sally
had
finished
her
friend
was
as
eager
as
herself
to
see
the
old
house
and
was
planning
with
all
the
help
of
a
vivid
imagination
what
it
would
be
like
when
it
should
be
restored
when
she
went
away
just
before
sally
set
about
getting
dinner
for
her
family
it
was
with
assurances
that
she
and
her
brother
would
help
sally
to
the
best
of
their
ability
to
realize
her
hopes
this
assurance
was
renewed
when
on
saturday
afternoon
the
lanes
met
the
burnsides
at
the
appointed
hour
to
take
the
with
the
exception
of
uncle
timothy
they
were
all
there
even
max
who
had
declared
his
only
interest
in
the
place
was
to
sell
it
but
hearing
that
jarvis
burnside
was
to
inspect
it
he
had
decided
to
point
out
to
jarvis
the
impracticability
of
making
a
home
out
of
the
property
unless
for
some
rich
man
who
might
be
induced
to
buy
it
at
a
figure
worth
while
he
sat
beside
jarvis
in
the
car
talking
to
him
as
sally
could
see
in
a
way
intended
to
prejudice
him
against
the
place
but
as
the
party
left
the
car
jarvis
joined
sally
smiled
at
her
from
behind
the
ugly
goggles
which
half
disguised
a
face
by
no
means
ugly
and
said
in
an
undertone
i
believe
i
in
possession
of
all
the
facts
from
now
on
i
intend
to
let
the
fancies
have
full
play
good
for
you
i
knew
you
never
desert
me
no
matter
how
much
in
the
wrong
i
might
be
answered
sally
gratefully
jarvis
had
been
a
fourth
brother
to
her
for
so
long
that
it
seemed
a
matter
of
course
for
her
to
depend
upon
his
support
but
she
appreciated
it
when
occasionally
the
real
brothers
failed
to
remember
how
lonely
the
young
sister
was
with
no
mother
at
hand
to
love
or
advise
her
all
but
bob
he
the
youngest
of
the
family
was
like
a
faithful
dog
always
beside
her
when
the
others
jeered
or
reproached
and
always
her
strongest
most
faithful
ally
the
walking
is
better
today
sally
called
out
as
they
started
max
true
to
his
cause
promptly
denied
the
truth
of
this
statement
josephine
came
to
the
rescue
who
cares
what
the
walking
is
like
on
an
april
day
like
this
she
challenged
max
is
the
air
glorious
and
wo
it
be
lovely
across
the
bridge
and
along
the
river
as
soon
as
the
leaves
are
out
max
was
escorting
josephine
and
as
they
turned
the
bend
in
the
road
he
pointed
out
to
her
the
boundary
lines
of
the
estate
she
asked
him
about
the
values
of
land
in
this
neighbourhood
and
the
possibilities
of
making
such
a
place
profitable
you
sound
like
a
business
woman
was
his
comment
thinking
of
investing
out
here
you
ought
to
get
sally
to
talk
the
place
up
to
you
she
estimates
that
by
raising
violets
on
the
whole
acres
and
selling
them
to
the
florists
in
town
we
can
be
millionaires
the
first
year
why
not
at
a
dollar
a
bunch
laughed
josephine
and
think
how
picturesque
your
property
will
look
all
a
soft
purple
in
the
sunshine
wo
it
agreed
max
there
that
the
house
i
suppose
prepared
to
fall
into
ecstasies
with
sally
on
the
and
dance
a
reel
with
her
down
the
hall
of
course
i
am
but
what
i
really
came
for
is
the
locked
door
the
door
i
believe
sally
forgotten
the
subject
of
her
dreams
we
have
a
tool
any
more
than
we
had
a
week
ago
have
we
though
shouted
bob
from
the
rear
he
began
to
extract
various
implements
from
his
pockets
on
the
spot
sally
herself
waved
her
jarvis
burnside
pulled
off
his
glove
and
began
to
search
his
own
pockets
i
think
we
effect
an
entrance
he
declared
and
produced
a
skeleton
key
this
will
open
any
ordinary
lock
josephine
said
everything
sally
could
have
hoped
for
about
the
exterior
of
the
house
and
a
few
things
more
it
did
seem
a
little
less
forlorn
than
before
the
effect
perhaps
of
the
april
sunshine
which
lighted
its
red
brick
walls
into
warm
and
cheerful
hues
jarvis
within
the
door
removed
his
goggles
and
blinked
approvingly
at
the
fine
colonial
features
of
the
the
lines
of
the
stairway
and
the
proportions
of
the
fireplace
anybody
can
see
those
two
are
loaded
complained
alec
in
max
ear
as
they
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
trust
jarve
burnside
to
back
up
sally
every
time
and
josephine
to
join
it
all
right
enough
for
him
to
talk
about
restoration
he
could
do
it
by
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
between
they
get
sally
completely
off
her
head
there
no
harm
in
looking
the
thing
over
max
replied
absently
but
alec
continued
to
rail
bob
turned
and
frowned
at
him
as
meaningly
as
bob
round
and
sunny
face
could
frown
why
must
alec
follow
max
lead
he
thought
one
could
gain
one
point
quite
as
readily
and
much
more
agreeably
by
being
amiable
at
least
this
was
bob
philosophy
the
door
sally
the
door
urged
josephine
as
the
party
finished
the
survey
of
the
lower
floor
i
ca
take
an
interest
in
any
more
open
rooms
while
i
know
there
a
closed
one
waiting
do
lead
the
way
up
that
impressive
staircase
and
take
us
straight
to
the
place
of
mystery
sally
still
young
enough
to
want
to
save
the
plums
in
the
cake
till
the
last
said
jarvis
as
they
went
up
well
well
this
stairway
is
certainly
a
quaint
one
risers
about
five
inches
are
they
max
treads
fourteen
at
least
fine
for
infants
and
invalids
and
comfortable
for
sitting
out
dances
sally
but
not
so
interesting
as
the
five
steep
steps
we
are
coming
to
and
sally
led
the
way
down
the
hall
to
the
side
passage
from
the
end
of
which
rose
the
little
flight
which
approached
the
locked
door
here
we
are
now
who
let
us
in
it
took
the
combined
efforts
of
jarvis
and
max
working
with
one
tool
after
another
to
effect
an
entrance
clearly
this
was
not
an
ordinary
closet
lock
which
barred
the
way
but
at
last
with
a
vigorous
wrench
jarvis
held
the
yielding
door
under
his
hand
from
the
top
step
he
waved
his
free
arm
at
the
company
standing
below
one
last
guess
apiece
he
demanded
of
them
before
you
look
old
seed
catalogues
and
empty
bottles
said
alec
a
skeleton
in
armour
cried
bob
all
your
aunt
alicia
and
your
uncle
maxwell
wedding
clothes
guessed
josephine
a
mahogany
sideboard
and
chairs
murmured
sally
at
which
there
was
a
general
shout
dead
beetles
fallen
plaster
and
a
musty
copy
of
lives
was
max
cynical
contribution
open
the
door
cried
bob
but
jarvis
still
held
it
i
think
i
let
in
one
at
a
time
he
declared
who
venture
first
sally
walked
up
the
steps
oh
do
send
her
in
all
alone
begged
josephine
think
what
if
there
be
the
skeleton
in
armour
urged
bob
go
on
sally
you
game
and
max
grinned
at
josephine
and
bob
it
does
take
much
to
rouse
some
people
imaginations
go
ahead
and
confront
the
seed
catalogues
and
the
beetles
with
a
bold
front
jarvis
smiling
at
sally
and
taking
note
of
her
pink
cheeks
detained
her
with
an
injunction
whatever
you
find
he
stipulated
make
no
outcry
retain
your
composure
remember
your
friends
are
close
at
hand
three
raps
on
the
inside
of
this
door
will
summon
four
stout
retainers
to
your
side
are
you
ready
ready
remember
that
defunct
beetles
are
harmless
old
clothes
retain
no
characteristics
of
their
former
owners
no
matter
how
and
empty
bottles
probably
never
contained
fatal
potions
if
the
place
is
dark
press
your
finger
on
this
he
thrust
a
small
electric
into
her
hand
and
the
mystery
will
be
illumined
brave
lady
enter
he
opened
the
door
just
wide
enough
to
admit
the
slim
figure
in
black
which
slipped
through
and
promptly
closed
the
door
upon
itself
josephine
interfered
jarvis
do
let
her
shut
that
door
something
might
happen
there
might
be
a
hole
in
the
floor
she
has
blue
eyes
and
you
black
retorted
jarvis
she
has
golden
locks
you
raven
do
let
the
outward
attributes
belie
themselves
like
that
josephine
held
up
a
beseeching
finger
everybody
listened
a
silence
ensued
unbroken
by
raps
or
sounds
of
any
sort
when
this
had
continued
for
some
five
minutes
josephine
spoke
urgently
jarvis
burnside
open
that
door
it
all
right
to
joke
but
things
do
happen
and
it
not
right
to
fool
this
way
what
the
matter
with
you
jo
burnside
demanded
max
while
jarvis
looking
quizzical
still
held
the
door
do
you
know
sally
well
enough
to
know
she
not
afraid
of
her
shadow
she
playing
the
game
through
she
come
back
in
her
own
good
time
when
she
thoroughly
explored
whatever
behind
that
door
a
mouse
wo
give
her
hysterics
or
a
flapping
make
her
scream
josephine
held
her
peace
but
she
looked
at
bob
bob
was
genuinely
uneasy
though
determined
not
to
show
it
there
is
undeniably
a
peculiar
atmosphere
about
old
and
unused
houses
and
queer
fancies
are
prone
to
take
possession
of
those
who
explore
them
it
was
ten
years
since
this
house
had
been
lived
in
there
was
something
odd
about
its
having
been
so
completely
deserted
with
not
even
a
tenant
left
to
occupy
its
kitchen
regions
and
look
after
it
and
the
lock
on
this
door
had
been
strangely
resistant
josephine
suddenly
opened
her
lips
to
say
i
shall
not
stand
here
waiting
another
minute
when
three
raps
on
the
door
brought
back
her
composure
jarvis
himself
looking
a
trifle
relieved
promptly
turned
the
knob
but
he
could
not
open
the
door
it
must
be
a
he
grunted
disgustedly
idiot
that
i
was
all
right
sally
he
called
got
to
work
the
tools
over
again
sally
o
sally
are
you
all
right
called
josephine
there
was
no
reply
jarvis
worked
rapidly
repeating
his
former
processes
with
an
impatient
hand
when
the
lock
yielded
once
more
he
threw
the
door
open
and
the
others
crowded
up
the
steps
a
staircase
was
the
common
ejaculation
bob
pushed
by
the
rest
and
ran
up
it
closely
followed
by
all
except
jarvis
i
stay
on
the
outside
of
this
fool
lock
he
called
but
a
moment
later
investigating
he
found
that
it
could
be
rendered
inoperative
by
a
catch
on
the
inside
which
being
set
allowed
the
door
to
open
and
close
freely
so
after
the
others
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
these
ascended
straight
between
the
walls
until
a
sharp
curve
at
the
top
brought
them
to
a
door
now
wide
open
within
the
room
beyond
stood
the
party
exclaiming
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
they
might
well
exclaim
of
all
the
guesses
none
had
come
within
distant
range
of
the
real
thing
the
room
was
that
of
a
collector
of
old
books
and
it
had
been
closed
and
left
precisely
as
its
former
owner
had
arranged
it
so
far
as
could
be
judged
by
its
present
appearance
a
faded
turkey
carpet
covered
the
floor
and
dusty
draperies
hung
at
the
windows
which
were
of
the
same
sort
as
those
in
the
attic
close
under
the
eaves
and
shut
in
by
a
pattern
of
ironwork
all
around
the
walls
stood
bookcases
filled
with
a
large
collection
of
books
the
greater
proportion
of
them
of
an
age
suggestive
to
the
inexperienced
eye
of
worthlessness
to
the
more
discerning
of
value
an
antique
desk
and
a
few
chairs
were
all
the
other
furnishings
of
the
room
but
of
these
it
needed
none
even
in
its
condition
it
was
a
room
to
command
respectful
consideration
as
jarvis
came
in
max
was
studying
the
rows
of
books
he
turned
about
with
a
small
volume
in
his
hand
and
his
eye
fell
on
jarvis
entering
jarve
he
exclaimed
i
believe
this
is
sure
enough
if
this
is
a
edition
i
eat
the
book
covers
and
all
jarvis
hurried
to
his
side
he
took
the
book
examined
the
and
turned
its
pages
his
eyes
lighted
with
interest
of
course
it
is
he
declared
and
by
the
looks
of
them
there
are
plenty
more
how
on
earth
do
they
come
to
be
here
this
is
a
gold
mine
that
beats
the
mahogany
sideboard
out
of
sight
it
more
than
i
know
uncle
maxwell
was
no
as
far
as
ever
heard
perhaps
uncle
tim
can
tell
though
he
on
mother
side
and
never
was
here
much
bob
eyes
were
round
with
delight
he
did
not
know
much
about
books
but
the
flush
on
sally
cheeks
and
the
excitement
in
max
voice
were
enough
for
him
he
could
not
resist
giving
his
elder
brother
a
rap
on
the
back
how
about
the
dead
beetles
now
max
he
exulted
alec
was
poking
in
the
of
the
desk
there
were
no
papers
to
be
found
except
one
bundle
of
letters
yellow
with
age
in
one
of
the
drawers
there
were
a
few
old
in
velvet
cases
and
a
yellowed
pipe
lane
esquire
read
sally
from
the
addresses
on
the
letters
which
were
written
on
the
folded
outer
sheet
of
the
letters
themselves
why
i
know
who
he
was
he
was
uncle
maxwell
elder
brother
he
lived
with
them
all
his
life
he
died
before
we
were
born
but
i
heard
father
tell
about
him
he
was
a
queer
old
man
when
father
was
a
boy
this
must
be
his
collection
and
uncle
maxwell
did
think
enough
of
it
to
take
it
to
town
with
him
just
locked
it
up
and
left
it
this
was
max
theory
uncle
maxwell
knew
nothing
about
books
and
cared
less
he
was
all
for
business
luckily
for
you
this
must
be
worth
a
good
deal
if
you
care
to
sell
it
said
jarvis
who
close
by
one
of
the
odd
windows
was
studying
the
fine
text
of
a
set
of
english
dramatists
sally
walked
over
and
gently
took
the
books
out
of
his
hand
jarvis
burnside
said
she
decidedly
the
value
of
this
collection
is
nothing
beside
the
value
of
your
eyes
put
on
your
goggles
and
do
look
at
another
line
of
type
chapter
iii
the
apartment
overflows
the
telephone
bell
in
the
lanes
apartment
rang
sharply
it
had
rung
once
before
but
sally
on
the
couch
in
the
middle
of
a
warm
april
morning
had
not
roused
enough
to
notice
she
moved
reluctantly
toward
it
max
voice
speaking
urgently
brought
her
back
to
her
senses
with
a
jump
sally
where
on
earth
are
you
i
just
had
a
wire
from
the
chases
that
they
coming
through
and
will
stop
off
to
see
us
we
have
to
put
them
up
somehow
of
course
they
do
know
how
we
fixed
but
find
out
oh
max
sally
tones
were
dismayed
why
we
we
have
to
what
would
you
have
me
do
wire
them
not
to
stop
besides
i
could
get
them
they
left
the
place
they
wired
from
reach
here
at
nine
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
supper
for
them
but
max
where
oh
figure
it
out
somehow
you
can
you
know
i
have
a
minute
more
to
talk
inspector
here
everybody
busy
and
the
click
of
the
receiver
in
sally
ear
ended
the
interview
the
chases
they
were
young
married
people
who
had
been
neighbours
and
schoolmates
of
the
lanes
dorothy
eustis
as
an
older
girl
had
been
much
admired
by
sally
and
josephine
until
she
married
neil
chase
that
event
had
made
a
great
difference
in
their
warmth
of
feeling
sally
did
not
like
neil
never
had
liked
him
and
never
would
like
him
a
certain
pomposity
of
manner
which
had
been
a
characteristic
of
his
ever
since
the
days
when
he
wore
dresses
and
lorded
it
over
the
other
infants
in
the
park
had
made
him
unpopular
he
had
however
become
a
successful
young
attorney
in
his
father
law
firm
and
had
within
the
last
year
gone
to
a
larger
city
several
hundred
miles
away
to
start
practice
for
himself
the
thought
of
entertaining
neil
and
dorothy
chase
in
the
little
apartment
was
almost
too
much
for
sally
lane
the
chases
had
gone
away
just
before
the
lanes
had
sold
the
old
house
and
knew
nothing
of
the
new
quarters
evidently
realized
nothing
of
their
small
dimensions
it
had
been
characteristic
of
them
to
telegraph
that
they
were
coming
without
waiting
for
a
reply
that
was
precisely
like
neil
something
must
be
done
and
at
once
it
was
now
eleven
there
was
none
too
much
time
in
which
to
make
ready
sally
began
reluctantly
to
plan
the
chases
must
have
her
room
of
course
it
was
the
best
in
the
flat
measuring
eight
feet
by
ten
bob
would
have
to
go
in
with
uncle
timothy
and
let
sally
have
his
usual
quarters
the
couch
in
the
sally
room
must
be
hastily
put
in
order
no
easy
task
in
a
space
where
every
inch
counts
because
it
must
be
made
the
most
of
she
was
thankful
for
once
that
she
need
expect
none
of
her
family
home
to
luncheon
at
noon
however
quite
unexpectedly
bob
ran
in
upon
her
an
errand
from
the
office
where
he
worked
having
brought
him
within
a
stone
throw
of
home
he
liked
to
surprise
sally
with
visits
when
he
could
do
so
by
making
time
over
the
rest
of
his
course
hello
what
up
was
his
greeting
as
he
surveyed
his
sister
standing
in
the
centre
of
an
extraordinary
confusion
of
furnishings
which
seemed
to
him
to
extend
over
the
entire
flat
sally
flung
down
her
and
sank
into
a
chair
showing
a
flushed
face
and
disturbed
eyes
max
telephoned
that
the
chases
are
coming
neil
and
dorothy
on
their
way
somewhere
is
it
horrible
what
do
you
suppose
think
of
things
here
well
well
old
neil
coming
to
show
us
his
chest
expansion
is
he
and
my
lady
dolly
hum
well
i
guess
it
will
good
to
see
how
some
people
live
chase
will
bring
four
trunks
and
a
lot
of
hand
stuff
will
she
if
she
does
we
move
out
and
leave
them
the
place
mercy
they
only
going
to
stay
overnight
at
least
i
all
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
up
is
the
thought
that
at
this
time
they
be
gone
a
hospitable
hostess
i
am
bob
but
oh
bobby
my
head
aches
so
this
morning
i
just
ca
rise
to
the
occasion
your
head
aches
what
the
reason
for
that
bob
asked
in
some
dismay
you
not
a
headache
sort
of
girl
no
and
that
why
it
seems
to
take
the
pluck
out
of
me
so
it
ached
yesterday
too
and
i
feel
just
heavy
and
stupid
as
she
spoke
she
turned
and
laid
her
head
down
on
her
arms
on
the
back
of
her
chair
bob
darted
across
from
the
doorway
and
laid
an
awkwardly
sympathetic
young
hand
on
the
flaxen
masses
of
his
sister
hair
it
a
shame
he
said
warmly
i
wish
i
could
stay
and
help
you
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
be
up
the
minute
i
get
out
of
the
office
leave
the
heavy
things
for
me
to
do
and
do
try
to
the
whole
flat
just
because
of
dorothy
chase
she
is
worth
it
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
five
in
the
afternoon
saw
him
at
home
again
helping
sally
in
every
way
he
could
think
of
bob
was
good
help
and
she
had
seldom
needed
him
more
than
she
went
about
with
flushed
cheeks
moving
languidly
yet
keeping
steadily
at
work
with
the
determination
of
the
young
hostess
who
sees
nothing
else
to
do
she
had
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
kitchen
she
spent
the
evening
in
all
those
little
final
tasks
which
seem
so
small
and
yet
in
the
aggregate
do
weigh
heavily
upon
the
eve
of
entertaining
work
at
the
bank
kept
max
until
he
had
barely
time
to
go
to
the
station
for
his
guests
alec
coming
home
to
dinner
and
finding
himself
put
off
with
what
he
hungrily
characterized
as
a
mere
bite
on
account
of
the
necessities
of
the
occasion
went
off
again
somewhere
declaring
that
he
did
not
see
the
occasion
for
starving
the
family
just
on
account
of
entertaining
two
already
overfed
visitors
uncle
timothy
as
was
to
be
expected
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
emergency
joined
bob
in
coming
to
sally
aid
and
at
half
past
seven
in
the
evening
might
have
been
discovered
by
the
curious
sitting
in
the
small
kitchen
a
apron
tied
about
his
neck
busily
polishing
silver
it
seemed
to
me
pretty
bright
before
sally
was
his
only
comment
as
he
worked
but
i
suppose
no
man
could
really
comprehend
the
difference
between
the
degree
of
brightness
suitable
for
one
family
and
that
demanded
by
company
if
you
had
seen
dorothy
chase
wedding
silver
responded
sally
and
stopped
there
as
if
words
could
no
further
go
yes
yes
i
suppose
so
uncle
timothy
was
rubbing
away
at
a
set
of
thin
old
teaspoons
which
had
belonged
to
sally
grandmother
still
my
dear
it
seems
as
if
things
taste
better
out
of
these
old
spoons
than
out
of
those
handsome
new
ones
the
boys
gave
you
christmas
oh
i
love
the
old
things
sally
held
a
china
sugar
bowl
with
a
gold
band
round
it
up
to
the
light
as
she
wiped
it
she
had
taken
all
the
best
old
china
out
of
its
hiding
place
under
the
couch
and
was
giving
it
a
bath
drying
each
article
herself
not
daring
to
trust
the
frail
pieces
to
bob
hands
but
dorothy
hates
old
stuff
and
wants
everything
modern
i
remember
said
uncle
timothy
mildly
i
was
always
too
antique
for
her
to
notice
i
be
surprised
if
she
stumbles
over
me
not
noticing
that
i
here
if
she
does
called
bob
from
the
depths
of
a
closet
which
he
was
sweeping
out
under
sally
direction
she
settle
with
me
she
find
i
grown
a
few
inches
since
she
used
to
call
me
sally
little
brother
it
was
all
done
at
last
sally
went
to
dress
wearily
exhorting
herself
to
remember
that
her
room
was
not
her
room
and
that
she
must
not
forget
and
leave
so
much
as
a
stray
on
the
freshly
washed
and
ironed
linen
of
the
little
she
stowed
away
under
the
couch
on
which
she
was
to
sleep
the
clean
cambric
she
meant
to
put
on
the
next
morning
feeling
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
surprising
if
she
were
unable
to
rise
from
that
couch
to
get
breakfast
and
wondering
what
dorothy
chase
could
do
about
breakfast
if
thrown
upon
her
own
resources
it
was
so
unusual
for
vigorous
young
frame
to
experience
such
exhaustion
after
even
more
severe
effort
than
that
of
the
past
day
that
she
could
only
wonder
what
it
meant
and
finally
decided
after
some
speculation
that
it
was
the
effect
of
these
first
warm
days
of
spring
combined
with
the
stress
of
entertaining
under
difficulties
well
here
we
are
max
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
hall
outside
ushering
in
his
guests
go
single
file
down
this
passage
you
ca
get
through
side
by
side
sally
went
hurriedly
forward
and
met
dorothy
chase
smartly
tailored
figure
in
the
middle
of
the
tiny
passage
goodness
gracious
bob
and
alec
and
timothy
rudd
heard
a
familiar
voice
exclaim
you
do
mean
to
tell
us
you
live
in
this
actually
my
hat
hits
on
both
sides
then
came
neil
chase
barytone
drawl
how
well
bob
remembered
hating
the
sound
of
it
with
a
profound
hatred
when
it
had
been
addressed
contemptuously
to
him
really
dorothy
you
know
i
told
you
that
brim
of
yours
was
an
inch
and
a
half
beyond
the
limit
and
this
proves
it
but
sally
pretty
head
was
held
high
if
she
had
a
headache
its
effect
was
visible
only
in
her
brilliant
cheeks
you
always
ran
to
extremes
dorothy
dear
why
did
you
take
that
absurd
creation
off
in
the
vestibule
neil
how
are
you
have
you
your
best
chesterfieldian
manner
with
you
because
you
better
leave
it
outside
the
apartment
not
large
enough
for
you
and
it
too
the
same
impertinent
child
declared
chase
surveying
her
hostess
in
the
light
of
the
and
here
smart
alec
as
that
youth
came
forward
his
smile
of
welcome
undergoing
a
wry
twist
at
this
somewhat
unusual
greeting
and
bob
heavens
child
how
you
grown
and
this
is
oh
yes
mr
rudd
her
careless
hand
in
its
travelling
glove
met
uncle
timothy
grasp
and
left
it
as
casually
as
her
bright
hazel
eyes
left
the
glance
of
his
faded
blue
ones
bob
watching
grinned
at
uncle
timothy
meaningly
and
received
in
return
the
mild
sparkle
of
amusement
with
which
the
antique
was
accustomed
to
show
himself
invulnerable
to
neglect
from
young
persons
of
dorothy
chase
stamp
neil
greetings
of
the
family
were
also
highly
characteristic
one
who
had
never
before
seen
him
might
have
argued
many
things
from
the
style
of
his
opening
address
this
is
alec
eh
well
alec
i
see
you
still
the
flower
of
the
family
bob
how
do
you
like
sweeping
out
offices
better
than
going
to
school
and
here
uncle
thomas
beg
pardon
uncle
joshua
not
got
it
right
yet
sally
confound
my
memory
yes
yes
uncle
timothy
how
are
you
my
dear
sir
i
see
responded
rudd
suddenly
grown
quietly
dignified
as
he
surveyed
this
jocular
young
man
whom
he
remembered
as
a
youth
whom
he
had
frequently
longed
to
thrash
that
in
spite
of
the
pressure
of
years
and
responsibility
you
happily
retain
your
boyish
characteristics
young
chase
regarded
uncle
timothy
for
an
instant
without
speaking
then
he
turned
to
sally
with
a
quite
audible
comment
the
old
gentleman
has
changed
much
has
he
keep
him
with
you
all
the
time
we
could
live
without
him
was
sally
quick
reply
uncle
timothy
catching
the
answer
smiled
to
himself
it
would
take
more
than
the
advent
of
these
gay
comets
in
his
sky
to
disturb
his
content
in
the
stars
which
revolved
loyally
about
him
the
two
hours
which
followed
were
occupied
in
instructing
the
guests
how
to
bestow
themselves
in
the
unaccustomed
limitations
of
the
lane
apartment
without
doing
themselves
physical
injury
the
chases
evidently
felt
that
the
surest
way
to
show
their
appreciation
of
the
hospitality
offered
them
was
to
be
uninterruptedly
mirthful
at
its
character
for
goodness
sake
sally
cried
chase
with
a
little
shriek
you
not
going
to
put
us
both
in
here
neil
do
you
dare
to
come
in
until
i
get
out
there
is
room
where
shall
i
hang
my
coat
oh
is
there
a
closet
behind
that
curtain
six
hooks
neil
you
ca
have
but
one
of
them
i
want
the
rest
sally
how
did
you
ever
come
to
it
after
that
great
roomy
old
house
of
yours
i
should
suffocate
in
a
week
lucky
we
going
on
i
could
change
my
gowns
in
here
i
thought
you
were
an
experienced
traveller
retorted
sally
lightly
enough
she
had
known
quite
what
to
expect
from
dorothy
it
did
not
disturb
her
seriously
good
travellers
can
tuck
themselves
away
anywhere
besides
this
room
is
palatial
in
comparison
with
uncle
timothy
there
not
room
for
a
in
his
you
should
be
thankful
that
you
have
one
and
a
mirror
the
mirror
the
one
real
essential
for
dorothy
eustis
chase
i
made
sure
you
had
that
it
just
like
you
not
to
own
up
that
you
cramped
dorothy
was
taking
full
advantage
of
the
mirror
pointed
out
her
elaborately
waved
chestnut
locks
received
her
full
attention
for
a
space
and
sally
slipped
away
to
the
kitchen
they
sat
down
presently
to
something
which
was
not
a
dinner
and
proved
decidedly
more
than
a
lunch
the
guests
ate
ravenously
but
did
not
forget
to
take
note
of
their
surroundings
neil
back
was
too
close
to
the
wall
for
sally
to
squeeze
by
him
when
she
rose
to
change
the
plates
and
this
amused
him
very
much
two
more
guests
and
the
room
would
burst
would
it
he
suggested
as
he
handed
a
plate
at
her
request
i
did
know
they
ever
made
a
flat
as
small
as
this
they
make
them
much
smaller
declared
max
with
a
sparkle
of
the
eye
i
assure
you
we
have
never
felt
crowded
until
oh
do
mind
us
dorothy
cried
you
see
we
just
come
from
visiting
the
grandons
and
their
house
is
so
enormous
it
makes
everything
seem
small
it
was
a
day
journey
across
our
room
and
was
as
big
as
this
whole
flat
it
a
lovely
place
to
visit
they
do
everything
for
you
they
have
so
many
servants
and
such
well
trained
ones
you
absolutely
forget
how
to
wait
on
yourself
how
long
were
you
there
alec
inquired
why
from
wednesday
to
when
did
we
leave
there
neil
oh
yes
it
must
have
been
yesterday
morning
three
days
no
wonder
you
became
too
used
to
such
luxury
to
be
able
to
come
down
to
waiting
on
yourselves
and
alec
applied
himself
to
his
plate
with
a
sense
of
having
evened
things
up
with
chase
in
return
for
her
smart
alec
it
was
sally
who
kept
matters
running
smoothly
her
head
throbbing
all
the
while
when
the
chases
had
been
finally
tucked
away
still
ironic
in
their
quarters
and
the
rest
of
the
family
had
bestowed
themselves
in
the
space
belonging
to
them
she
sat
down
by
the
open
window
too
weary
to
undress
here
bob
emerging
from
uncle
room
in
search
of
belongings
necessary
to
his
comfort
found
her
why
do
you
go
to
bed
he
asked
i
going
but
i
like
to
sit
here
all
night
you
catch
cold
by
that
window
head
still
ache
i
suppose
so
i
too
tired
to
feel
anything
any
more
cheer
up
i
be
around
bright
and
early
and
do
everything
i
know
of
course
you
will
bobby
and
she
held
out
her
hand
he
grasped
it
your
hand
hot
he
observed
are
sick
are
you
of
course
not
i
never
sick
go
to
bed
dear
i
be
all
right
in
the
morning
optimistically
bob
thought
she
would
the
next
morning
however
the
sally
who
confronted
him
looked
so
far
from
herself
as
she
went
slowly
about
the
little
kitchen
that
he
was
worried
and
said
so
never
mind
do
say
anything
after
breakfast
i
can
rest
can
you
brace
up
to
get
through
breakfast
demanded
bob
anxiously
sally
assured
him
that
she
could
and
proved
it
somehow
after
the
manner
of
women
she
came
to
the
table
with
a
smile
so
bright
that
nobody
noticed
that
she
ate
almost
nothing
that
her
hand
shook
as
she
poured
the
coffee
and
that
her
blue
eyes
were
very
heavy
immediately
after
breakfast
the
chases
were
off
in
a
cab
engaged
by
max
in
deference
to
sally
wishes
neil
and
dorothy
took
a
jocose
farewell
the
one
declaring
that
their
presence
had
stretched
the
apartment
till
it
could
be
seen
to
gape
at
the
seams
the
other
vowing
that
sally
must
come
to
see
her
soon
in
order
to
be
able
to
take
a
full
breath
again
then
the
cab
bore
them
away
well
of
all
the
alec
left
the
sentence
unfinished
max
completed
it
for
him
nerve
if
that
a
sample
of
legal
brilliancy
of
wit
i
sorry
for
the
defendant
who
employs
him
he
grunted
the
chases
had
arrived
on
saturday
night
and
were
continuing
their
journey
without
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
was
sunday
sally
turned
back
into
the
passage
remembering
that
on
sundays
her
family
were
to
be
provided
for
in
the
matter
of
luncheon
and
that
they
were
in
the
habit
of
looking
forward
to
the
extra
good
things
she
was
accustomed
to
serve
them
upon
that
day
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
stared
at
the
standing
just
as
they
had
all
left
it
do
you
stir
sis
cried
bob
returning
with
the
others
al
and
do
the
dishes
then
as
he
saw
an
expression
of
disfavour
cross
his
brother
face
at
this
unwelcome
proposal
he
added
quickly
she
sick
sally
is
with
all
this
and
it
time
somebody
noticed
it
they
all
looked
at
her
she
tried
to
smile
up
at
them
but
the
unwilling
tears
came
instead
i
be
all
right
if
i
can
just
lie
down
a
while
she
said
then
they
rallied
in
alarm
not
one
of
them
but
loved
sally
as
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
however
careless
of
her
comfort
one
or
another
of
them
might
now
and
then
seem
to
be
max
put
a
brotherly
arm
round
her
tired
out
little
girl
he
asked
gently
and
led
her
toward
the
couch
in
the
all
for
those
ungrateful
duffers
as
he
followed
to
put
a
pillow
under
his
sister
head
alec
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
knock
at
least
one
of
the
duffers
down
she
had
all
she
could
do
to
keep
up
for
hours
cried
bob
pulling
a
small
knit
rug
over
sally
feet
she
managed
to
smile
at
them
choking
back
quite
unwonted
tears
sally
was
no
baby
to
cry
at
a
touch
of
fatigue
she
had
known
they
would
be
very
good
to
her
once
they
understood
it
was
uncle
timothy
who
at
once
became
practical
he
drew
up
a
chair
beside
the
couch
and
took
sally
wrist
in
his
counting
carefully
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
forehead
against
her
flushed
cheeks
he
bade
her
put
out
her
tongue
and
surveying
that
member
through
his
spectacles
came
to
his
conclusions
these
he
did
not
inflict
upon
sally
who
had
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
like
a
tired
child
instead
he
beckoned
max
into
another
room
and
said
she
sick
sure
enough
pulse
jumping
skin
hot
and
dry
and
too
tired
to
move
suppose
you
telephone
doctor
wood
to
look
in
this
morning
max
lost
no
time
he
went
down
stairs
to
telephone
that
not
hear
and
in
his
suddenly
roused
anxiety
made
his
message
so
urgent
that
the
doctor
arrived
within
the
hour
he
was
the
family
physician
long
employed
by
the
lanes
and
he
had
known
sally
from
her
babyhood
it
took
him
but
the
space
of
a
brief
yet
thorough
examination
to
form
his
opinion
he
communicated
it
under
his
breath
to
sally
four
men
who
had
tiptoed
anxiously
out
into
the
hall
where
he
had
beckoned
them
it
looks
mighty
like
typhoid
he
said
and
they
winced
at
the
word
it
too
soon
to
be
certain
but
there
more
or
less
of
it
about
you
ca
take
care
of
her
here
and
she
be
far
better
off
at
the
hospital
i
send
a
carriage
and
a
nurse
by
twelve
so
do
hours
change
outlooks
the
last
thing
any
one
of
the
lanes
had
expected
to
be
doing
at
noon
on
that
peaceful
spring
sunday
was
to
be
standing
in
the
vestibule
of
the
winona
flats
watching
the
little
sister
being
conveyed
away
in
the
care
of
a
nurse
but
so
it
was
do
look
so
blue
dears
sally
had
murmured
as
she
left
them
soon
be
back
you
know
heaven
grant
it
ejaculated
uncle
timothy
in
his
heart
as
for
the
others
they
filed
silently
up
stairs
again
and
into
the
empty
room
it
was
full
of
all
the
things
that
had
seemed
to
make
it
home
with
sally
there
but
somehow
it
looked
empty
now
nobody
said
much
of
anything
unless
it
became
necessary
but
before
bedtime
four
pregnant
sentences
had
been
uttered
that
nurse
looked
as
if
she
knew
something
said
max
suddenly
there
not
a
man
in
the
city
equal
to
wood
declared
alec
seems
as
if
she
could
smile
quite
like
that
if
she
was
going
to
be
awfully
sick
was
bob
contribution
to
the
sum
total
of
hopefulness
but
it
was
uncle
timothy
as
usual
who
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
boys
said
he
we
can
do
our
part
on
our
knees
and
to
a
man
they
nodded
suddenly
they
could
not
speak
chapter
iv
arguments
and
answers
i
sure
that
as
good
a
report
as
we
could
hope
for
urged
josephine
burnside
but
the
anxiety
in
her
eyes
somewhat
qualified
her
cheerfulness
maxwell
lane
shook
his
head
doubtfully
her
own
that
all
they
said
the
last
three
days
he
said
yes
but
that
a
good
deal
at
this
stage
it
the
end
of
the
second
week
she
out
of
her
head
they
usually
are
i
think
the
pair
emerged
from
the
door
of
the
hospital
well
i
glad
i
met
you
here
said
max
it
kind
of
you
to
come
so
often
it
not
kind
at
all
i
could
stay
away
and
if
i
could
jarvis
would
let
me
no
telephone
messages
will
satisfy
him
good
old
fellow
how
are
his
eyes
worse
than
ever
mother
and
i
take
turns
reading
to
him
while
he
tramps
the
floor
we
should
try
to
get
him
off
somewhere
into
the
country
but
he
wo
leave
until
sally
is
out
of
the
hospital
and
i
no
idea
he
will
leave
then
he
be
so
anxious
to
do
things
for
her
good
old
chap
murmured
max
again
absently
he
was
looking
at
josephine
as
if
an
idea
had
struck
him
are
you
going
to
do
anything
in
particular
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
do
know
that
i
am
why
do
you
want
to
invite
me
to
drive
out
into
the
country
in
your
trap
the
roads
are
pretty
good
now
and
i
ought
to
go
out
and
take
a
look
at
the
farm
besides
i
too
restless
to
keep
still
saturday
afternoons
and
sundays
are
tough
to
get
through
with
just
now
i
shall
be
delighted
come
home
with
me
and
we
start
right
away
i
should
like
to
see
the
place
again
too
fifteen
minutes
by
and
ten
to
allow
for
the
ordering
of
the
trap
and
the
two
young
people
were
driving
away
josephine
held
the
reins
over
the
back
of
a
fine
gray
mare
that
seemed
glad
to
get
out
of
the
stable
on
this
sunny
may
afternoon
the
roads
were
even
better
than
max
had
predicted
and
the
drive
was
soon
over
there
are
the
pines
josephine
pointed
with
her
whip
how
far
away
they
show
against
the
lighter
foliage
i
fond
of
pines
they
make
me
think
of
the
mountains
you
lucky
to
have
that
grove
if
you
ever
live
here
it
will
be
a
lovely
spot
for
hot
summer
afternoons
we
never
live
here
if
i
can
help
it
answered
max
as
for
the
pine
grove
the
best
thing
to
do
with
that
is
to
cut
it
down
and
get
the
money
out
of
it
max
exclaimed
josephine
do
do
that
without
the
permission
of
every
member
of
your
family
and
most
of
your
friends
what
the
money
the
money
a
good
deal
to
me
this
illness
of
sally
sell
the
books
if
you
must
but
not
the
trees
of
course
you
ought
to
keep
both
but
do
cut
down
those
trees
you
as
bad
as
sally
about
this
old
place
hello
there
some
one
in
the
grove
now
what
he
doing
standing
on
his
head
for
a
leg
could
be
descried
waving
in
the
air
while
its
owner
apparently
lay
partly
on
his
back
his
shoulders
against
a
tree
trunk
as
the
trap
came
nearer
the
man
could
be
seen
distinctly
he
was
reading
with
one
leg
balancing
across
the
knee
of
the
other
seems
to
have
taken
possession
of
my
grounds
i
suppose
he
also
would
object
if
i
offered
to
cut
down
the
grove
is
he
going
to
see
us
no
too
absorbed
in
his
yellow
novel
he
sees
us
but
we
nothing
to
him
he
turned
back
to
his
page
shall
we
drive
in
are
you
going
to
get
out
yes
of
course
if
only
to
show
that
chap
i
the
owner
of
his
lounging
place
josephine
turned
in
and
the
trap
swung
through
the
gateway
and
on
past
the
pine
grove
max
saw
the
reader
get
to
his
feet
coming
to
apologize
murmured
max
well
if
he
asks
permission
he
can
stay
till
i
cut
down
the
grove
before
the
horse
had
been
tied
the
stranger
was
at
hand
since
caught
in
the
act
i
come
and
ask
if
i
may
he
said
genially
this
is
lane
i
believe
i
donald
ferry
a
neighbour
of
yours
your
fine
grove
is
a
sort
of
of
the
wild
to
me
max
shook
hands
attracted
at
once
by
both
voice
and
face
donald
ferry
was
a
sturdy
young
man
with
broad
shoulders
and
a
thick
thatch
of
hair
he
possessed
a
pair
of
searching
but
friendly
hazel
eyes
he
was
dressed
in
a
rough
suit
of
blue
serge
and
a
gray
flannel
shirt
with
a
rolling
collar
and
flowing
blue
tie
gave
him
an
air
confirmed
by
the
tan
and
freckles
on
his
face
and
the
sinewy
grip
of
his
brown
hand
he
had
closed
his
book
and
tucked
it
under
his
arm
so
that
its
title
could
not
be
observed
but
it
had
not
exactly
the
look
of
a
yellow
novel
you
entirely
welcome
to
make
use
of
the
grove
as
much
as
you
like
max
answered
with
the
cordiality
he
could
not
help
feeling
toward
the
possessor
of
so
frank
and
genial
a
look
as
that
with
which
the
strange
young
man
continued
to
regard
him
i
live
with
my
mother
in
the
little
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
grove
explained
mr
ferry
we
been
living
there
for
a
fortnight
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
caught
sight
of
anybody
about
the
place
it
seemed
so
completely
deserted
i
been
proposing
to
my
mother
that
we
appropriate
the
house
but
she
seems
a
trifle
appalled
by
the
size
of
it
on
the
whole
for
us
ours
is
rather
the
better
fit
this
house
is
too
big
to
fit
anything
but
an
orphan
asylum
said
max
with
a
wave
toward
the
brick
walls
now
heavily
with
the
tender
green
leafage
of
may
it
in
bad
shape
from
chimneys
to
cellar
just
the
same
i
a
sister
who
is
wild
to
live
here
yet
you
are
the
one
who
comes
out
to
look
over
the
place
perhaps
you
have
a
sort
of
sneaking
fondness
for
it
after
all
my
sister
would
come
if
she
could
she
in
the
hospital
with
typhoid
explained
max
wondering
as
he
did
so
how
he
came
to
be
giving
details
like
these
in
his
first
conversation
with
a
stranger
he
really
liked
the
look
of
the
fellow
extraordinarily
well
this
will
be
a
great
place
for
her
to
grow
strong
in
by
and
by
suggested
the
other
his
tone
indicating
his
sympathy
with
the
situation
the
pine
grove
in
june
will
be
better
than
a
sanatorium
max
shook
his
head
it
not
practical
for
us
to
think
of
living
here
of
course
we
can
bring
her
out
for
a
day
at
a
time
you
might
put
up
a
tent
in
the
grove
nothing
like
for
convalescents
and
for
well
people
well
lane
thank
you
immensely
for
letting
me
feel
free
of
the
grove
until
you
come
to
live
i
am
fairly
sure
you
will
come
to
live
here
some
day
it
an
irresistible
old
place
he
took
his
leave
with
a
pleasant
grace
of
manner
which
in
spite
of
the
rough
old
suit
and
flannel
shirt
spoke
of
training
in
other
places
than
pine
groves
when
he
had
gone
off
among
the
pines
toward
the
hedge
which
lay
between
the
grove
and
the
little
white
cottage
on
the
side
toward
wybury
max
rejoined
josephine
he
looked
a
pretty
good
sort
did
he
if
anybody
did
live
here
he
be
an
interesting
neighbour
i
hardly
knew
there
was
a
house
there
did
you
oh
yes
i
saw
it
as
we
came
by
it
had
been
freshly
painted
white
and
i
noticed
how
pleasant
it
looked
it
a
tiny
house
unless
his
mother
is
smaller
than
he
is
it
certainly
must
be
a
tight
fit
she
probably
about
the
size
of
a
pint
pot
mothers
of
strapping
fellows
like
that
usually
are
he
was
any
taller
than
you
was
he
i
thought
he
was
a
giant
he
outweigh
me
by
fifty
pounds
josephine
glanced
at
him
it
struck
her
that
max
never
of
stalwart
build
looked
paler
and
thinner
than
usual
there
was
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
she
recalled
the
straight
set
of
those
belonging
to
the
strange
young
man
max
she
asked
quite
suddenly
how
much
light
do
you
have
in
your
office
floods
of
it
replied
max
promptly
i
have
to
wear
a
shade
sometimes
daylight
bless
your
soul
no
what
do
you
think
a
banking
house
gets
between
a
lot
of
buildings
electrics
of
course
are
the
only
things
possible
then
you
do
have
the
daylight
at
all
i
have
plenty
of
light
to
work
by
i
think
it
dreadful
cried
josephine
she
had
never
thought
of
it
before
or
considered
max
pale
skin
as
the
direct
result
of
spending
his
days
under
such
conditions
if
you
could
see
the
difference
between
your
face
and
mr
ferry
max
stared
at
her
that
chap
seems
to
have
made
a
great
impression
on
you
he
complained
he
probably
has
an
job
of
some
sort
his
clothes
showed
it
engineering
more
than
likely
that
was
undoubtedly
a
book
on
dynamics
or
hydraulics
or
something
of
that
sort
you
ca
expect
a
bank
clerk
to
have
a
skin
like
an
indian
under
electric
light
come
on
shall
we
walk
back
to
the
timber
tract
that
what
i
want
to
look
at
i
suppose
you
wo
object
to
my
cutting
there
there
must
be
a
lot
of
stuff
fit
to
sell
and
as
i
told
you
i
need
the
money
when
sally
gets
out
of
the
hospital
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
she
fit
to
work
uncle
tim
says
typhoid
convalescents
are
pretty
slow
at
getting
back
to
the
working
stage
have
to
keep
on
hiring
that
mary
ann
flinders
she
polishes
the
stove
with
the
napkins
i
think
they
look
it
goodness
how
poor
sally
would
feel
if
she
knew
she
does
know
i
told
her
the
last
time
i
saw
her
before
she
got
these
funny
notions
in
her
head
she
thought
i
was
an
episcopal
bishop
come
to
marry
her
to
the
doctor
they
got
me
out
right
away
max
you
must
not
tell
sally
disturbing
things
about
home
she
will
be
anxious
enough
when
she
herself
without
hearing
about
napkins
and
things
from
you
i
suppose
so
but
i
been
so
blue
ever
since
she
went
i
keep
in
then
keep
out
max
looked
at
her
josephine
dark
cheeks
were
pink
partly
with
indignation
partly
with
the
brisk
progress
over
the
slightly
rising
grade
of
the
cartpath
through
the
fields
toward
the
timber
tract
well
you
sort
of
down
on
your
friends
are
you
i
an
idiot
to
think
of
cutting
down
the
pine
grove
i
a
milksop
compared
with
a
indian
you
never
saw
before
now
i
a
blunderbuss
for
answering
a
simple
question
asked
me
by
my
sister
what
do
you
think
i
am
anyhow
fit
to
cumber
the
earth
josephine
returned
his
gaze
she
seemed
not
in
the
least
awed
by
this
burst
of
wrath
she
replied
with
spirit
not
unmixed
with
good
humour
i
think
you
peppery
as
usual
has
an
old
friend
like
me
a
right
to
try
to
keep
things
straight
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
say
one
word
to
sally
that
will
give
her
a
minute
anxiety
goodness
knows
she
had
enough
of
it
keeping
house
for
you
four
people
for
three
whole
years
have
we
been
taking
care
of
her
all
that
time
demanded
max
with
rising
colour
of
his
own
have
we
all
been
working
our
heads
off
to
pay
expenses
and
giving
her
every
cent
we
could
get
to
run
things
with
of
course
you
have
it
what
you
ought
to
do
but
i
certainly
give
you
credit
for
doing
it
only
i
do
think
you
fully
appreciated
part
she
worked
harder
than
any
of
you
has
she
told
you
so
max
was
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
and
his
eyes
were
angry
never
you
know
she
has
she
not
that
kind
of
girl
but
i
another
girl
and
i
can
see
for
myself
sally
worked
hard
to
make
that
apartment
seem
like
home
no
matter
how
blue
she
felt
herself
never
acted
blue
before
you
now
has
she
i
ca
say
that
she
has
she
a
girl
always
was
and
do
you
think
it
sally
been
putting
on
a
brave
face
and
letting
everybody
suppose
she
cheerful
she
kept
you
all
up
when
she
was
bluer
than
you
are
now
max
stopped
short
stood
still
in
the
and
looked
josephine
in
the
eye
she
stopped
also
and
faced
him
coolly
will
you
tell
me
how
you
know
all
this
he
inquired
fiercely
i
put
two
and
two
together
and
found
they
make
four
replied
josephine
see
here
max
she
spoke
more
gently
but
quite
as
decidedly
as
before
you
must
think
i
trying
to
be
disagreeable
now
of
all
times
of
course
i
know
you
boys
all
love
sally
as
devotedly
as
brothers
can
and
do
a
great
deal
to
show
it
but
when
it
comes
to
sparing
her
anxiety
and
letting
her
have
her
way
about
things
she
has
set
her
heart
on
i
do
think
you
always
quite
as
considerate
as
you
might
be
i
did
dream
of
saying
all
this
but
when
you
began
to
talk
about
cutting
down
that
pine
grove
though
you
knew
what
a
fancy
sally
took
to
it
it
came
over
me
that
you
would
be
just
as
likely
as
anything
to
do
it
right
now
while
sally
is
sick
and
i
just
help
speaking
out
the
two
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
distance
then
max
spoke
gloomily
it
all
right
enough
to
consider
sentiment
and
i
know
you
well
enough
to
understand
what
you
mean
by
pitching
into
me
this
way
but
the
craze
sally
been
in
over
this
old
place
seems
to
me
a
thing
out
of
all
reason
what
are
we
a
family
of
bank
clerks
and
office
boys
to
shoulder
a
proposition
like
this
we
ca
think
of
moving
out
here
and
living
in
that
barracks
and
trying
to
make
a
living
off
the
soil
neither
can
we
put
a
tenant
on
here
and
fit
him
out
with
farm
tools
and
take
the
responsibility
and
the
risk
of
his
running
the
place
he
undoubtedly
run
us
into
the
ground
the
first
year
i
thought
it
over
and
thought
it
over
and
the
only
course
seems
to
me
to
be
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
place
money
is
easy
just
now
and
i
no
doubt
we
have
a
hard
time
to
get
a
decent
price
meanwhile
it
seems
to
me
only
common
sense
to
get
what
income
we
can
out
of
it
if
i
could
sell
that
big
pine
grove
and
cut
off
what
timber
is
ready
for
the
axe
up
here
it
would
bring
us
something
quite
substantial
now
this
certainly
was
a
presentation
of
the
case
which
called
for
a
considerate
listening
but
quite
as
if
she
had
not
heard
a
word
of
his
argument
josephine
cried
out
max
why
not
do
what
mr
ferry
proposed
if
you
think
the
house
ca
be
lived
in
put
up
a
tent
in
the
grove
and
bring
sally
there
as
soon
as
she
fit
for
it
she
get
strong
twice
as
fast
as
in
that
stuffy
flat
max
gazed
at
her
that
just
what
you
get
he
ejaculated
when
you
try
to
talk
business
with
a
girl
show
her
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
why
you
ca
do
a
thing
and
she
instantly
asks
why
you
ca
do
something
ten
times
harder
will
you
tell
me
how
with
sally
out
here
in
a
tent
we
fellows
are
going
to
get
along
in
the
flat
and
what
would
she
do
out
here
all
by
herself
it
was
now
josephine
turn
to
gaze
with
scorn
at
her
companion
do
you
think
i
proposing
for
sally
to
camp
by
herself
out
here
while
mary
ann
flinders
keeps
house
for
you
in
town
no
bring
mary
ann
out
here
to
cook
for
sally
and
you
boys
come
out
for
the
nights
if
you
had
a
bit
of
camp
spirit
you
jump
at
the
chance
to
get
a
real
outing
right
along
with
your
work
camp
exclaimed
max
in
your
own
front
yard
the
pine
grove
is
your
front
yard
and
the
farther
end
of
it
is
so
far
away
from
the
road
nobody
could
tell
who
was
who
back
there
besides
what
difference
if
sally
gets
strong
again
as
fast
as
life
can
make
her
it
not
practical
max
continued
to
object
and
josephine
realized
afresh
that
the
lane
temperament
was
not
one
easily
swayed
by
argument
or
appeal
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
max
which
was
as
hard
to
deal
with
now
as
it
had
been
in
the
days
when
josephine
had
fought
it
out
with
him
in
playground
affairs
yet
she
did
not
lose
hope
she
had
known
max
to
come
round
if
left
to
himself
convinced
in
the
end
by
logic
derived
from
his
own
consideration
of
the
case
if
he
could
once
see
a
course
as
fair
and
right
he
would
accept
it
clearly
he
did
not
yet
see
this
thing
in
any
such
light
and
it
was
of
no
use
to
persist
in
heated
argument
which
would
only
result
in
prejudicing
him
yet
further
against
the
plan
which
seemed
to
josephine
so
wise
a
one
the
two
walked
through
the
timber
tract
max
pointing
out
trees
which
he
thought
could
be
sacrificed
with
a
real
gain
to
the
timber
to
be
left
standing
josephine
listened
and
agreed
finding
genuine
interest
in
the
long
vistas
of
oak
and
chestnut
pillars
stretching
away
to
what
seemed
an
infinite
distance
for
dense
undergrowth
at
the
back
of
the
wood
prevented
the
appearance
of
an
outlet
anywhere
as
they
drove
away
they
noted
with
new
interest
the
small
white
cottage
on
the
farther
side
of
the
dividing
hedge
there
your
friend
ferry
observed
max
as
they
flew
by
at
the
gray
mare
smartest
pace
working
away
in
a
strawberry
patch
as
if
his
life
depended
on
it
that
where
he
gets
his
beautiful
indian
complexion
you
admire
so
much
when
he
is
doing
engineering
stunts
probably
home
just
now
between
jobs
fixing
up
his
mother
in
her
new
place
well
we
ca
all
grow
strawberries
and
lie
round
on
our
backs
reading
hydraulics
some
of
us
have
to
do
the
jobs
of
course
those
are
useless
mere
folly
all
the
really
sensible
chaps
are
looking
after
the
colour
of
their
skins
chapter
v
telephones
and
tents
hello
jarve
this
you
over
the
telephone
jarvis
burnside
recognized
max
lane
voice
eager
and
cheerful
the
last
time
he
had
heard
it
it
had
been
so
despondent
that
his
own
anxiety
had
been
heavily
increased
he
answered
eagerly
yes
what
is
it
there
a
break
in
her
temperature
a
break
you
mean
a
drop
a
landslide
during
the
last
twelve
hours
she
sleeping
quietly
she
but
something
suddenly
interfered
with
the
speaker
articulation
although
jarvis
continued
to
listen
with
strained
attention
a
silence
succeeded
his
imagination
filled
the
gap
he
essayed
to
offer
congratulations
but
found
something
the
matter
with
his
own
powers
of
speech
after
a
moment
struggle
however
he
was
able
to
say
i
be
round
as
quick
as
i
can
get
there
burnside
passing
the
telephone
closet
at
the
back
of
the
hall
heard
a
rush
therefrom
and
found
herself
suddenly
embraced
by
a
pair
of
long
arms
although
blue
goggles
concealed
her
son
eyes
from
her
look
of
sympathetic
inquiry
the
smile
which
transformed
his
face
was
not
to
be
mistaken
jarvis
dear
you
had
good
news
max
could
say
much
but
his
voice
told
the
fever
down
sleeping
oh
i
am
glad
so
glad
the
dear
child
i
could
sleep
last
night
after
the
discouraging
news
her
son
did
not
say
that
he
had
not
slept
but
he
looked
it
his
finely
cut
features
showed
plainly
that
for
more
than
one
night
he
had
been
suffering
severe
and
increasing
strain
we
must
tell
josephine
said
his
mother
happily
proceeding
on
her
way
with
jarvis
arm
about
her
shoulders
you
look
her
up
please
i
going
to
bolt
down
to
see
max
and
the
rest
uncle
timothy
was
about
all
in
last
night
when
i
met
him
these
last
five
days
jarvis
released
his
mother
seized
his
hat
from
a
tree
they
were
passing
and
escaped
out
of
a
side
door
burnside
hurried
away
upstairs
to
find
her
daughter
if
the
burnside
family
had
been
bound
to
the
lanes
by
ties
of
blood
each
member
of
it
could
hardly
have
been
more
intimately
concerned
with
the
issue
of
sally
illness
away
down
town
at
the
winona
flats
jarvis
ring
brought
an
instant
response
and
a
minute
later
bob
was
shaking
his
hand
off
at
the
landing
then
alec
was
rushing
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
max
was
shouting
from
the
where
he
was
shaving
uncle
timothy
alone
remained
quiet
in
his
chair
but
his
worn
face
was
bright
it
great
news
rudd
great
news
cried
jarvis
wringing
uncle
timothy
hand
of
welcome
yes
jarvis
yes
but
i
must
warn
you
all
to
make
haste
slowly
in
the
matter
of
assurance
it
looks
favourable
certainly
but
the
child
has
been
through
a
hard
fight
and
she
is
not
out
of
danger
yet
you
know
i
do
want
to
dampen
your
happiness
boys
and
uncle
timothy
looked
tenderly
from
one
face
to
another
out
of
the
wisdom
of
his
greater
experience
their
faces
had
sobered
i
understand
sir
of
course
jarvis
agreed
but
the
drop
in
the
fever
and
the
quiet
sleep
surely
mean
a
promising
change
very
promising
no
doubt
of
it
and
we
are
thankful
thankful
it
is
a
wonderful
relief
after
the
reports
we
have
been
getting
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
wiped
them
then
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
care
now
he
began
again
cheerfully
but
bob
could
not
help
interrupting
she
getting
splendid
care
he
cried
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
it
was
still
necessary
to
exercise
caution
lest
they
rejoice
prematurely
he
had
taken
the
leap
from
boyish
despair
to
boyish
confidence
at
a
bound
and
he
had
no
mind
to
drop
back
to
a
point
of
doubt
and
depression
i
suppose
we
ought
to
wait
a
few
days
before
we
run
up
any
flags
max
admitted
and
the
others
reluctantly
agreed
during
the
following
week
they
learned
the
reasons
for
respecting
rudd
advice
though
sally
bark
had
certainly
rounded
the
most
threatening
danger
point
there
yet
remained
seas
by
no
means
smooth
to
be
traversed
and
more
than
once
wind
and
waves
rose
again
sufficiently
to
cause
a
return
of
anxiety
to
those
who
watched
but
could
not
go
to
the
rescue
but
in
due
time
recovery
became
assured
convalescence
was
established
and
finally
the
great
day
was
at
hand
when
she
should
come
home
from
the
hospital
she
looked
still
very
pale
and
weak
as
they
saw
her
lying
in
her
high
white
bed
in
the
long
ward
how
they
had
mourned
that
they
could
not
afford
to
give
her
a
private
room
but
she
was
sally
herself
once
more
and
looking
so
eagerly
forward
to
being
at
home
again
that
it
was
a
joy
to
see
her
smile
at
the
thought
of
it
i
wish
it
were
not
so
excessively
hot
said
uncle
timothy
regretfully
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
sally
room
it
had
been
put
in
order
by
mary
ann
flinders
or
to
be
more
exact
mary
ann
flinders
had
attempted
to
put
it
in
order
for
sally
reception
the
next
day
max
looked
in
over
his
uncle
shoulder
i
do
know
that
it
any
hotter
in
here
than
anywhere
else
he
demurred
irritably
he
was
in
his
and
he
had
that
moment
removed
his
collar
and
uncle
timothy
had
got
as
far
as
taking
off
his
waistcoat
and
donning
an
old
alpaca
coat
in
which
he
had
been
striving
to
imagine
himself
comfortable
i
think
it
must
be
several
degrees
warmer
in
this
small
room
than
in
the
asserted
uncle
timothy
and
it
is
there
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
poor
child
should
have
to
come
back
to
such
an
oven
as
this
at
the
hospital
a
breeze
circulates
through
the
wards
here
there
seems
to
be
none
she
could
sleep
on
the
couch
in
the
suggested
max
it
hot
what
possesses
the
weather
to
start
in
like
this
before
june
half
over
i
believe
it
was
one
hundred
and
twelve
in
the
office
he
threw
himself
on
the
couch
after
a
moment
of
reclining
upon
it
during
which
he
mopped
his
brow
and
drew
his
handkerchief
about
his
neck
he
rose
and
jerked
the
couch
toward
one
of
the
two
open
windows
when
he
had
lain
in
this
new
situation
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
more
he
got
up
again
and
sought
the
tiny
kitchen
where
he
could
be
heard
drawing
water
from
the
tap
ugh
warm
as
dish
water
uncle
timothy
could
hear
his
distant
splutter
bob
and
alec
were
out
somewhere
presumably
cooling
off
in
one
of
the
city
parks
or
on
the
river
front
also
they
were
getting
impatiently
through
the
hours
before
sally
return
the
entire
lane
household
had
reached
the
point
where
her
coming
home
seemed
a
thing
never
to
be
attained
to
a
man
they
felt
that
one
week
more
without
her
would
be
unendurable
but
the
next
day
it
was
sunday
again
she
came
home
josephine
and
max
with
the
burnside
carriage
and
horses
brought
her
to
the
door
max
and
alec
making
a
chair
of
hands
and
wrists
carried
the
pitifully
light
figure
up
the
four
flights
of
stairs
and
josephine
hovered
over
the
convalescent
as
she
was
established
upon
the
couch
among
many
pillows
the
rest
of
them
stood
about
in
a
smiling
circle
oh
but
it
good
to
be
home
sighed
sally
happily
looking
from
one
to
another
with
eyes
which
seemed
to
them
all
as
big
as
saucers
so
deep
were
the
hollows
about
them
and
so
thin
her
cheeks
but
how
pale
and
tired
you
all
look
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
the
truth
is
i
think
dear
explained
josephine
glancing
from
max
to
uncle
timothy
your
family
have
been
having
typhoid
then
at
startled
expression
she
added
gently
it
almost
as
wearing
you
know
to
have
a
fever
of
anxiety
over
somebody
you
love
as
to
have
the
real
thing
in
the
hospital
oh
exclaimed
sally
softly
and
her
eyes
fell
then
she
drooped
limply
against
her
pillows
it
just
a
little
hot
is
it
she
murmured
alec
consulted
the
thermometer
it
ninety
here
now
he
announced
at
ten
in
the
morning
about
three
this
afternoon
sally
see
what
we
can
do
here
and
no
promised
by
the
weather
man
bob
brought
a
fan
and
perching
himself
at
the
head
of
couch
began
to
fan
her
i
produce
from
the
north
and
east
he
promised
al
why
do
you
get
her
some
we
began
to
take
ice
yesterday
only
yesterday
questioned
sally
with
her
eyes
closed
but
she
forbore
to
ask
why
they
had
delayed
so
long
well
she
knew
that
illnesses
are
expensive
affairs
if
you
only
had
let
us
take
you
to
our
house
cried
josephine
for
the
tenth
time
since
she
had
first
proposed
that
plan
we
could
have
made
you
so
much
more
comfortable
sally
opened
her
eyes
again
no
you
could
joey
she
said
unless
you
had
taken
all
the
rest
of
them
i
could
spare
my
family
another
day
may
we
come
in
it
was
jarvis
burnside
bringing
his
mother
to
see
sally
neither
of
them
had
yet
set
eyes
upon
her
since
her
illness
sally
had
been
at
home
for
two
days
now
two
intemperately
hot
days
during
this
entire
period
she
had
lain
on
the
couch
which
was
drawn
as
close
to
the
window
as
it
could
be
placed
uncle
timothy
had
remained
at
hand
with
fans
and
iced
lemonade
and
every
other
expedient
he
could
think
of
for
mitigating
the
perfervid
temperature
of
the
flat
just
now
at
five
in
the
afternoon
with
no
breeze
whatever
entering
at
the
window
the
small
was
at
its
worst
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
sally
held
out
a
languid
hand
but
her
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
while
his
mother
bent
over
sally
jarvis
pushed
up
his
goggles
then
pulled
them
off
the
room
was
shaded
but
even
so
the
daylight
made
him
blink
painfully
for
a
minute
but
by
the
time
he
got
his
chance
at
greeting
the
invalid
he
was
able
to
see
clearly
for
himself
just
how
sally
was
looking
he
stared
hard
at
her
noting
with
a
contraction
of
the
heart
all
the
evidences
of
the
fight
for
life
she
had
been
through
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
as
josephine
had
said
she
looked
as
if
a
breath
might
blow
her
away
i
look
like
a
little
boy
now
do
i
suggested
sally
smiling
up
at
him
as
his
hand
closed
over
hers
she
put
up
her
other
hand
to
her
head
where
the
heavy
masses
of
fair
hair
had
given
way
to
a
short
curly
crop
most
childish
in
its
clustering
framing
of
her
now
delicate
face
a
blow
to
my
vanity
but
it
growing
fast
and
by
the
time
i
can
hold
my
head
up
good
and
strong
like
a
baby
it
will
be
long
enough
to
tie
with
a
bow
at
my
neck
you
ca
hold
your
head
up
yet
questioned
jarvis
anxiously
oh
yes
i
can
declared
sally
cheerfully
i
just
do
seem
to
want
to
not
when
there
a
convenient
pillow
to
lay
it
on
but
i
shall
get
strong
pretty
soon
now
when
the
weather
changes
why
even
if
i
were
lying
down
on
the
bank
of
a
brook
somewhere
or
in
the
woods
or
almost
anywhere
i
believe
i
feel
quite
a
lot
stiffer
in
my
backbone
and
still
you
wo
come
to
us
and
let
us
make
you
comfortable
burnside
looked
as
if
she
would
enjoy
doing
it
but
sally
looked
over
at
uncle
timothy
and
her
shake
of
the
head
was
as
decided
as
ever
not
while
uncle
timmy
and
the
boys
stay
here
have
you
seen
max
and
alec
lately
burnside
i
do
believe
i
a
bit
paler
than
they
are
working
in
those
hot
offices
in
the
artificial
light
i
shall
grow
strong
fast
enough
the
nurse
told
me
people
always
feel
like
this
after
typhoid
and
when
i
do
get
strong
i
shall
be
a
trojan
just
wait
we
do
like
to
wait
said
jarvis
still
watching
sally
although
his
eyes
were
feeling
the
adverse
influences
of
the
white
daylight
which
beat
into
the
room
underneath
the
shades
he
put
up
his
hand
for
an
instant
to
shield
them
and
sally
was
quick
to
notice
i
thought
you
were
wearing
goggles
jarvis
she
said
burnside
turned
with
a
reproachful
expression
and
with
a
laugh
jarvis
drew
the
goggles
out
of
his
pocket
and
replaced
them
a
fellow
gets
tired
of
viewing
life
through
these
things
he
explained
and
i
been
seeing
you
in
imagination
through
blue
spectacles
so
to
speak
for
five
weeks
now
i
thought
i
like
a
glimpse
of
your
true
complexion
sally
put
up
two
thin
hands
and
pinched
her
cheeks
fiercely
i
believe
i
must
resemble
a
tallow
candle
she
complained
what
can
you
people
expect
of
a
patient
just
out
of
the
hospital
we
like
to
get
you
where
nature
would
attend
to
putting
on
the
rouge
eh
mother
and
jarvis
thought
of
his
friend
max
with
a
strong
desire
to
take
that
refractory
young
man
by
the
collar
and
argue
with
him
with
his
fists
if
it
had
not
been
for
max
stubbornness
sally
would
not
now
be
suffering
the
discomfort
of
this
unspeakable
apartment
when
he
and
his
mother
had
reached
the
outer
air
again
and
were
driving
away
jarvis
burst
out
something
must
be
done
if
sally
wo
let
you
and
jo
have
her
and
that
would
be
getting
her
out
of
the
city
only
into
a
more
bearable
atmosphere
she
must
be
taken
into
the
country
jo
plan
is
perfectly
feasible
a
tent
in
that
pine
grove
would
do
the
business
mother
i
going
to
put
one
there
if
max
does
like
it
he
can
stay
away
jarvis
dear
how
can
you
do
that
max
would
resent
that
way
of
managing
his
affairs
i
dare
say
he
would
what
of
that
if
ever
a
frail
child
needed
to
get
sally
does
are
we
old
friends
enough
to
take
things
into
our
own
hands
max
wo
accept
a
tent
from
you
or
sally
either
wo
they
they
wo
have
to
it
be
my
tent
i
lend
it
to
them
jarvis
grinned
his
white
teeth
making
a
striking
contrast
to
the
sombre
effect
of
his
big
goggles
hold
on
cheney
he
said
to
the
coachman
let
me
out
at
the
corner
of
seventeenth
i
will
look
up
the
tent
business
right
here
and
now
his
mother
looked
after
his
tall
figure
as
he
hurried
away
through
the
down
town
crowds
his
straw
hat
a
little
pushed
back
as
it
was
wont
to
be
in
moments
of
excitement
she
herself
felt
like
heartily
aiding
and
abetting
his
friendly
schemes
for
sally
was
very
dear
to
her
motherly
heart
and
it
had
seemed
to
her
impossible
that
the
girl
should
recover
her
strength
while
shut
up
in
the
little
flat
if
the
heat
lasted
and
there
were
no
indications
of
any
near
break
in
the
high
temperature
it
would
certainly
be
a
severe
test
on
the
young
convalescent
and
might
seriously
retard
her
in
the
important
business
of
getting
back
her
old
vigour
within
an
hour
jarvis
was
at
home
again
in
time
for
dinner
he
came
to
the
table
with
a
catalogue
in
his
hand
determination
was
written
large
upon
his
face
josephine
had
heard
from
her
mother
of
his
expressed
intention
and
she
eyed
the
catalogue
eagerly
are
you
really
going
to
do
it
jarve
she
cried
of
course
i
going
to
do
it
with
your
help
help
i
do
any
thing
have
you
told
max
i
tell
him
nothing
till
the
tent
up
and
furnished
here
look
at
this
list
and
advise
me
as
to
size
would
an
eighteen
by
of
the
heaviest
duck
be
about
right
eighteen
by
why
that
how
big
would
that
be
about
the
size
of
this
i
could
get
an
eighteen
by
josephine
interrupted
him
with
a
burst
of
delighted
laughter
you
might
get
sally
a
circus
tent
she
cried
as
big
as
this
why
jarve
she
wants
the
whole
family
with
her
explained
jarvis
with
composure
that
means
the
tent
must
be
divided
off
into
rooms
and
she
must
have
one
section
for
a
i
going
to
have
a
floor
made
the
carpenter
will
go
out
in
the
morning
if
he
keeps
his
word
by
quick
work
we
ought
to
be
able
to
take
her
out
there
night
but
allowing
for
delays
the
next
evening
will
have
to
do
mother
have
we
any
cots
i
afraid
we
have
no
cots
there
are
two
white
iron
beds
in
the
attic
all
the
better
may
i
have
them
i
wonder
you
stop
to
ask
permission
of
anybody
for
anything
observed
josephine
mother
have
you
seen
jarvis
look
so
waked
up
since
he
put
on
goggles
burnside
smiled
she
was
very
glad
to
see
her
son
so
interested
although
she
felt
decidedly
doubtful
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
lanes
would
take
his
interference
in
their
affairs
still
as
jarvis
had
urged
people
who
have
been
friends
from
childhood
with
an
old
family
friendship
of
fathers
and
grandfathers
behind
them
should
have
some
rights
when
it
comes
to
matters
so
important
and
if
anybody
could
manage
max
proud
and
intolerant
temper
jarvis
with
his
quiet
firmness
should
be
the
one
josephine
also
was
of
the
which
can
fight
for
that
which
seems
right
between
them
if
they
could
not
put
the
thing
through
it
would
be
rather
remarkable
joey
will
you
and
mother
drive
out
with
me
this
evening
and
decide
on
where
to
put
the
tent
jarvis
rose
from
the
table
after
having
made
a
hasty
meal
which
did
not
include
any
superfluous
courses
of
course
i
will
josephine
pushed
aside
her
dessert
i
will
stay
at
home
and
look
up
blankets
and
bedding
announced
burnside
have
you
thought
of
the
cooking
question
shall
we
try
to
supply
the
utensils
if
you
can
spare
them
mother
i
buy
what
you
ca
contribute
bargained
for
a
little
gasolene
stove
and
a
small
tent
for
a
kitchen
as
for
the
cooking
is
that
specimen
they
have
in
the
flat
now
good
enough
to
import
to
the
camp
she
pretty
poor
i
had
luncheon
there
yesterday
with
sally
josephine
face
spoke
louder
than
her
words
mother
could
you
spare
joanna
for
a
week
or
two
till
they
can
find
somebody
she
can
cook
almost
as
well
as
sarah
you
know
she
cooked
for
me
last
fall
when
you
were
away
and
sarah
was
taken
jarvis
mother
looked
at
him
doubtfully
i
think
you
had
better
not
go
as
far
as
that
be
content
with
supplying
the
tent
and
its
equipment
and
see
how
max
and
alec
take
it
the
young
girl
they
have
now
will
do
for
a
time
surely
all
right
if
you
think
that
the
better
plan
ready
sis
jarvis
put
the
gray
mare
through
her
paces
and
there
was
still
an
hour
of
daylight
left
when
he
and
josephine
reached
the
pine
grove
it
ten
degrees
cooler
out
here
than
it
is
in
town
at
this
hour
declared
jarvis
with
satisfaction
he
pushed
up
the
goggles
and
lowered
them
again
quickly
even
the
subdued
light
in
the
grove
at
a
point
where
the
setting
sun
did
not
penetrate
was
too
much
for
his
eyes
confound
the
things
he
exploded
shall
i
ever
be
anything
again
but
an
owl
in
daylight
well
where
shall
the
tent
go
over
there
replied
josephine
promptly
there
just
one
perfect
spot
for
it
on
the
top
of
that
little
rise
looking
toward
the
south
and
away
from
the
grove
right
you
are
but
the
trees
are
too
thick
he
pulled
out
a
and
began
to
measure
presently
he
announced
the
result
one
tree
this
little
fellow
will
have
to
come
down
do
you
dare
of
course
i
dare
where
can
i
get
an
axe
josephine
glanced
toward
the
house
then
she
thought
of
the
ferry
cottage
the
little
house
beyond
the
hedge
i
know
the
people
at
least
i
met
one
of
them
shall
we
go
and
ask
jarvis
was
already
hurrying
toward
a
distant
gap
in
the
hedge
i
go
he
called
back
in
two
minutes
he
reappeared
with
him
was
a
sturdy
figure
josephine
recognized
the
broad
shoulders
the
thick
hair
the
gleam
of
the
hazel
eyes
she
nodded
at
donald
ferry
noting
that
he
was
not
now
clad
in
a
gray
flannel
shirt
but
in
one
of
white
with
a
low
collar
and
silk
similar
to
jarvis
dress
with
an
urban
air
about
it
he
carried
an
axe
thank
you
said
jarvis
when
they
had
reached
the
spot
which
josephine
had
designated
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
axe
ferry
shook
his
head
smiling
which
is
the
tree
he
inquired
give
me
the
axe
please
repeated
jarvis
there
no
reason
why
you
should
chop
down
trees
for
us
on
a
sweltering
night
like
this
it
wo
make
me
swelter
as
much
as
it
will
you
asserted
ferry
retaining
his
hold
on
the
axe
i
an
old
woodman
come
show
me
the
tree
or
i
chop
at
a
venture
miss
burnside
josephine
pointed
out
the
tree
ferry
lifted
the
axe
and
swung
it
and
it
sank
deeply
into
the
trunk
another
blow
it
struck
the
same
spot
another
and
another
with
an
unerring
aim
you
are
a
woodman
admitted
jarvis
admiringly
watching
the
powerful
swing
and
the
telling
blows
ferry
laughed
without
abating
the
vigour
of
his
work
there
no
better
fun
that
i
know
of
said
he
than
chopping
down
a
tree
i
could
think
of
missing
this
chance
chapter
vi
in
the
pine
grove
sally
will
you
and
max
go
for
a
drive
with
us
it
will
cool
you
off
for
sleep
josephine
stood
looking
in
on
them
herself
in
white
from
head
to
foot
a
refreshing
sight
for
tired
eyes
to
rest
upon
sally
drew
herself
up
eagerly
upon
her
couch
pillows
max
yawned
and
stretched
in
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
half
asleep
oh
it
would
be
so
good
to
get
out
sally
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
max
rubbed
his
eyes
sally
can
go
i
think
i
go
to
bed
much
obliged
please
go
max
we
want
you
very
much
and
it
too
hot
here
to
sleep
he
worn
out
explained
sally
but
the
drive
will
rest
you
boy
she
insisted
jarvis
is
driving
he
has
something
to
talk
over
with
you
urged
josephine
max
unwillingly
put
on
his
coat
he
felt
tired
enough
he
had
never
known
so
trying
a
period
of
work
as
that
which
had
been
driving
him
now
for
weeks
at
the
bank
with
this
accompaniment
of
intense
heat
which
made
his
labours
seem
doubly
hard
he
gave
sally
his
arm
down
the
stairs
wondering
if
she
felt
much
weaker
than
he
did
and
reflecting
that
in
one
thing
she
had
the
advantage
over
him
she
need
not
work
until
she
should
feel
fit
as
for
himself
he
must
work
fit
or
not
the
rest
of
sally
family
were
out
she
had
been
sending
them
away
nightly
to
sit
in
the
park
by
the
river
bank
allowing
only
one
to
remain
with
her
although
she
had
been
at
home
nearly
a
week
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
see
that
she
had
made
any
gain
in
acquiring
strength
each
evening
bob
and
uncle
timothy
searched
the
daily
paper
in
vain
for
prophecy
of
change
in
the
weather
and
each
morning
they
eyed
the
flags
upon
a
certain
tall
building
with
a
distinct
sense
of
resentment
toward
them
for
persistently
indicating
fair
and
dry
good
delighted
to
be
able
to
lure
you
out
called
jarvis
from
his
driver
seat
although
it
was
evening
he
wore
his
goggles
on
account
of
the
myriad
bright
lights
of
this
district
and
they
shone
upon
his
guests
like
welcoming
lamps
above
his
satisfied
smile
tired
out
old
fellow
he
asked
max
as
he
wheeled
the
horses
about
absolutely
done
this
heat
is
the
worst
i
ever
knew
the
place
where
my
desk
stands
is
the
hottest
corner
in
the
hottest
bank
in
the
hottest
city
in
the
universe
this
certainly
has
been
the
worst
day
yet
that
why
i
thought
you
might
like
to
get
out
into
the
country
do
care
where
i
go
said
max
excuse
me
if
i
shut
my
eyes
and
keep
quiet
i
have
energy
enough
to
say
any
more
for
a
mile
all
right
shut
your
eyes
and
i
tell
you
when
to
open
them
max
turned
sidewise
in
his
seat
rested
his
elbow
on
the
back
propped
his
head
upon
his
hand
closed
his
eyes
and
appeared
to
slumber
jarvis
drove
on
silently
noting
with
pleasure
the
subdued
murmur
of
talk
going
on
behind
him
where
sally
after
a
long
and
lonely
day
was
enjoying
the
chance
to
visit
with
her
friend
the
girl
lay
back
against
the
luxurious
padding
of
the
burnside
carriage
resting
and
drinking
in
the
refreshing
sense
of
coolness
caused
more
by
the
motion
than
by
a
greatly
lowered
temperature
for
the
evening
was
very
warm
presently
however
as
they
left
the
city
and
turned
out
upon
a
country
road
the
lessening
heat
and
freer
stirring
of
the
air
became
distinctly
perceptible
a
passing
stream
of
automobiles
setting
out
for
some
scene
of
festivity
at
a
popular
resort
several
miles
away
roused
max
from
his
lethargy
with
their
tooting
horns
and
brilliant
lights
lucky
ducks
he
muttered
in
surly
tones
they
can
always
stir
up
a
breeze
they
not
the
only
ones
who
can
stir
up
breezes
rejoined
jarvis
i
about
to
stir
up
one
myself
i
should
think
you
own
a
runabout
remarked
max
perhaps
i
will
some
day
when
you
people
get
to
living
out
here
max
looked
about
him
headed
for
the
farm
are
we
you
seem
to
have
a
fancy
for
this
road
it
the
prettiest
outside
the
city
look
here
max
he
lowered
his
voice
that
sally
might
not
catch
a
word
of
the
coming
talk
i
want
to
own
up
to
something
i
been
taking
liberties
with
your
place
out
here
jarvis
pulled
off
his
goggles
and
turned
his
eyes
upon
his
companion
max
yawned
once
more
it
was
the
last
time
he
yawned
that
evening
from
that
moment
he
became
thoroughly
awake
well
what
is
it
he
asked
had
the
house
painted
and
moved
in
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
i
put
up
a
tent
in
your
grove
and
moved
out
max
stared
let
keep
our
voices
low
for
a
bit
urged
jarvis
i
want
to
surprise
sally
i
knew
if
i
asked
your
permission
to
camp
in
your
grove
give
it
to
me
without
a
minute
hesitation
so
banking
on
your
generosity
i
took
possession
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
all
it
struck
me
that
every
last
one
of
you
needed
an
outing
and
i
thought
if
you
found
a
tent
all
in
order
out
here
perhaps
you
like
to
try
camping
through
this
hot
spell
max
was
still
staring
jarvis
faced
him
silently
straining
his
eyes
in
the
darkness
to
see
what
manner
of
expression
might
be
discovered
upon
the
face
beside
him
showing
so
whitely
through
the
obscurity
max
did
not
reply
for
the
space
of
a
full
minute
when
he
did
it
was
not
necessary
for
jarvis
to
strain
his
eyes
to
make
out
the
expression
he
could
tell
what
it
was
quite
without
seeing
it
it
may
be
the
proper
thing
to
bank
on
a
person
generosity
said
max
in
a
tone
of
deep
displeasure
but
as
a
rule
i
think
it
pays
to
consult
a
man
before
you
take
possession
of
his
property
now
this
speech
was
highly
characteristic
and
therefore
not
unexpected
nevertheless
it
made
jarvis
burnside
feel
exceedingly
like
kicking
his
friend
violently
from
his
seat
into
the
road
for
a
moment
all
he
could
command
himself
to
do
was
to
tighten
his
grip
on
his
horses
and
send
them
at
a
considerably
accelerated
pace
along
the
smooth
turnpike
when
he
spoke
however
it
was
with
no
change
from
the
quiet
good
humour
of
his
former
tone
you
do
mean
just
that
with
an
old
friend
like
me
mother
and
jo
are
with
me
in
this
attempt
at
a
pleasant
surprise
they
will
be
tremendously
hurt
if
you
get
up
on
your
dignity
and
take
it
this
way
we
knew
you
had
no
time
to
be
arranging
camps
here
or
anywhere
else
yet
we
saw
you
working
yourself
to
death
and
sally
needing
to
get
out
of
the
heat
i
understand
jo
talked
this
thing
at
me
the
last
time
we
were
out
here
it
a
trick
to
get
round
my
refusal
to
live
here
you
think
you
can
get
in
an
entering
wedge
it
no
use
wo
live
out
here
nonsense
and
sally
voice
interrupted
from
behind
max
is
this
glorious
you
feel
like
a
new
person
we
must
be
almost
at
the
farm
just
think
i
have
seen
the
farm
since
april
before
a
leaf
was
out
but
josephine
who
understood
the
situation
and
was
anxious
to
prevent
any
interference
with
the
conversation
now
going
on
upon
the
front
seat
promptly
drew
sally
back
to
their
own
interview
max
listen
to
me
jarvis
spoke
in
a
still
lower
voice
do
one
thing
for
the
sake
of
my
pride
if
not
for
yours
i
may
have
blundered
but
you
know
i
did
mean
to
i
thought
i
could
count
on
your
understanding
my
motives
but
anyhow
just
for
give
way
to
my
schemes
and
do
let
the
others
see
that
you
offended
with
us
if
after
a
night
here
you
still
honestly
think
i
a
fool
and
a
meddler
i
wo
say
another
word
a
night
here
do
you
expect
to
keep
us
here
all
night
why
not
you
must
think
i
i
think
you
a
reasonable
being
and
a
brother
if
sally
likes
the
plan
and
wants
to
stay
let
her
if
she
does
cheerfully
take
you
both
home
mother
here
to
welcome
us
and
make
the
thing
proper
and
we
all
planned
to
stay
think
of
the
oven
your
flat
is
come
be
good
and
you
be
cool
do
you
realize
you
treating
me
like
a
small
boy
i
feel
rather
like
one
myself
one
who
has
stolen
a
cake
out
of
the
pantry
and
is
in
danger
of
a
thrashing
was
jarvis
whimsical
admission
see
here
i
give
you
leave
to
take
it
out
of
me
all
you
like
i
agree
to
meet
you
at
midnight
in
the
timber
tract
and
take
whatever
you
see
fit
to
administer
provided
you
keep
in
before
the
rest
what
do
you
say
in
making
this
preposterous
proposition
he
was
apparently
perfectly
serious
it
was
as
burnside
had
said
if
anybody
could
manage
max
proud
stubbornness
it
was
jarvis
with
his
cool
command
of
himself
and
his
inborn
habit
of
courtesy
to
everybody
yet
even
jarvis
had
his
hands
full
max
physical
condition
of
fatigue
and
overwrought
nerves
made
him
more
than
ordinarily
captious
and
difficult
to
handle
confound
you
you
got
me
in
a
corner
he
muttered
that
what
i
do
like
if
you
had
come
out
in
the
open
with
your
plans
you
have
refused
me
you
just
said
you
counted
on
my
generosity
if
you
were
so
sure
of
it
why
did
you
ask
for
it
jarvis
laughed
oh
be
reasonable
do
you
let
people
plot
at
christmas
time
and
on
birthdays
to
take
you
by
surprise
you
hardly
call
it
not
being
in
the
open
because
they
do
ask
your
permission
to
present
you
with
a
or
a
the
horses
trotted
briskly
on
quiet
ensuing
behind
them
for
a
little
while
max
fell
into
a
sulky
silence
sally
into
a
happy
one
as
she
leaned
out
watching
for
the
final
turn
in
the
road
before
the
pines
should
come
into
sight
jarvis
was
wondering
just
how
max
would
behave
and
hoping
that
sally
pleasure
would
blind
her
eyes
to
her
dissatisfaction
he
was
counting
a
good
deal
on
the
impression
his
camp
would
make
as
he
thought
it
would
look
in
the
moonlight
with
a
little
camp
fire
before
it
it
seemed
to
him
it
must
appeal
to
anybody
sally
gave
a
little
cry
there
the
grove
how
big
and
dark
it
looms
up
at
night
i
can
smell
it
before
i
get
near
it
in
my
imagination
been
smelling
it
all
these
hot
days
and
longing
for
it
oh
what
that
at
the
back
did
you
see
a
flash
of
something
sally
was
fairly
hanging
out
of
the
carriage
her
gaze
feasting
on
the
cool
depths
of
gloom
under
the
tall
trees
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
little
leaping
flames
of
the
camp
fire
somebody
must
be
in
there
agreed
josephine
perhaps
it
mr
ferry
who
lives
next
door
in
the
white
cottage
remember
my
telling
you
about
him
max
gave
him
leave
to
inhabit
the
grove
all
he
liked
everything
so
dry
he
might
set
it
on
fire
considered
sally
anxiously
you
wo
fear
any
such
carelessness
on
his
part
when
you
see
him
josephine
assured
her
confidently
the
carriage
turned
in
at
the
gate
in
another
minute
it
had
reached
a
point
where
the
tent
began
to
show
from
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
hand
clutched
max
shoulder
her
brother
was
surveying
the
signs
of
occupancy
of
the
debatable
ground
why
there
a
tent
there
she
cried
a
big
tent
and
some
one
in
front
who
is
it
do
you
know
she
turned
excitedly
to
josephine
then
she
touched
jarvis
shoulder
i
seem
to
be
doing
all
the
exclaiming
she
declared
you
people
must
know
about
this
is
it
is
it
a
it
seems
to
be
replied
jarvis
turning
to
see
her
face
as
the
struck
it
aglow
with
wonder
and
anticipation
josephine
caught
her
hand
it
on
your
land
sally
dear
she
said
do
you
mind
did
it
ever
strike
you
said
jarvis
quickly
in
max
ear
that
this
sally
land
and
alec
and
bob
quite
as
much
as
yours
burnside
came
out
to
greet
the
party
and
sally
tumbled
into
her
welcoming
arms
hugging
her
frantically
and
pulling
away
from
her
again
to
look
about
her
she
seemed
a
different
girl
from
the
limp
and
languid
one
who
had
climbed
into
the
carriage
an
hour
before
is
it
absolutely
enchanting
she
exclaimed
gazing
eagerly
into
the
big
tent
the
open
flaps
of
which
showed
an
outer
room
arranged
with
rugs
chairs
couch
and
table
other
open
flaps
at
the
corners
of
this
outer
enclosure
invited
exploration
and
sally
promptly
obeyed
the
summons
she
found
four
smaller
rooms
securely
partitioned
by
high
tightly
stretched
canvas
walls
she
came
back
beaming
what
does
it
all
mean
she
begged
are
we
to
stay
here
was
there
ever
anything
so
inviting
as
those
beds
and
cots
i
could
hardly
keep
from
falling
into
one
of
them
you
may
fall
into
one
as
soon
as
you
choose
said
josephine
gleefully
the
one
on
the
southeast
corner
is
yours
the
one
with
the
blue
japanese
rug
on
the
floor
and
the
wicker
chair
with
the
blue
cushion
we
sent
a
telephone
message
to
the
rest
of
your
family
so
they
wo
expect
you
back
jarvis
returning
with
max
from
the
bestowal
of
his
horses
in
the
barn
found
his
mother
and
the
two
girls
sitting
in
a
row
upon
a
rustic
seat
at
a
little
distance
from
the
tent
their
faces
toward
the
camp
fire
now
a
mere
flicker
which
nobody
had
taken
the
trouble
to
revive
it
was
too
hot
a
night
for
camp
fires
except
as
welcoming
beacons
well
questioned
jarvis
standing
before
the
three
upon
whom
the
bright
midsummer
moonlight
streamed
so
luminously
that
the
white
figures
were
visible
in
every
detail
well
responded
josephine
very
well
i
think
added
burnside
more
than
well
and
sally
clasped
her
hands
in
a
way
both
characteristic
and
eloquent
a
dozen
tonics
could
have
made
me
feel
so
much
stronger
as
the
notion
of
sleeping
in
that
big
white
tent
i
wish
i
knew
just
what
the
thermometer
says
it
is
in
the
flat
at
home
oh
poor
uncle
timmy
and
bob
and
alec
how
i
wish
they
were
here
you
max
it
would
have
taken
a
harder
heart
than
that
which
beat
wearily
in
breast
to
allow
him
to
answer
his
sister
sullenly
you
like
it
sally
he
asked
taking
a
position
where
the
moonlight
did
not
illumine
his
face
like
it
she
exclaimed
jo
says
we
to
stay
if
you
are
willing
live
in
this
tent
and
have
the
others
out
and
mary
ann
flinders
we
need
mary
ann
long
i
be
strong
enough
myself
to
cook
in
another
week
oh
was
it
dear
and
kind
of
these
people
to
plan
this
for
us
what
could
he
do
or
say
against
it
all
without
seeming
a
churl
and
an
ingrate
but
before
he
could
formulate
the
inwardly
grudging
yet
outwardly
appreciative
reply
he
felt
forced
to
make
jarvis
himself
had
interposed
with
a
flow
of
lively
talk
explaining
to
sally
various
details
of
arrangement
and
sparing
max
the
necessity
of
making
any
insincere
speeches
and
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
the
setting
forth
by
josephine
on
the
table
in
the
tent
outer
room
of
a
light
but
tempting
supper
brought
from
home
in
a
hamper
the
product
of
no
mary
ann
flinders
but
of
the
burnside
cook
mm
mm
the
soft
but
eloquent
sound
came
from
sally
closed
lips
when
she
had
taken
her
first
taste
of
a
sandwich
of
unknown
but
delicious
compound
was
ever
anything
so
good
max
boy
please
try
one
quick
what
is
this
perfect
drink
joey
how
it
does
go
to
the
spot
oh
if
you
are
all
half
as
happy
as
sally
lunn
you
do
know
how
to
express
it
we
even
happier
said
josephine
laughing
softly
for
it
seems
at
last
as
if
we
have
sally
lunn
back
jarvis
had
hard
work
to
keep
his
own
pleasure
properly
subdued
he
sat
just
across
the
table
from
max
and
the
light
from
two
candles
shone
revealingly
into
his
satisfied
face
he
put
on
his
goggles
to
screen
his
eyes
hoping
that
they
might
assist
in
concealing
his
content
until
max
gave
in
and
agreed
to
it
all
it
would
never
do
to
let
anybody
but
sally
crow
with
delight
burnside
insisted
on
an
early
bedtime
for
sally
and
the
convalescent
reluctantly
admitted
that
not
even
joy
was
wholly
sustaining
to
such
weakness
of
limb
as
was
still
hers
so
she
submitted
with
a
sigh
of
appreciation
to
being
tucked
away
in
the
bed
in
the
southeast
enclosure
of
the
tent
and
soon
was
lying
peacefully
there
watching
through
her
open
the
moonlight
as
it
lay
on
the
open
lawn
beyond
the
vista
of
trees
the
air
was
now
stirring
refreshingly
through
the
grove
and
sally
under
the
thinnest
of
light
summer
blankets
was
absolutely
comfortable
and
restful
as
she
had
not
been
for
many
weary
nights
in
the
adjoining
room
max
was
asleep
in
two
minutes
after
he
had
stretched
himself
upon
his
cot
outside
by
the
embers
of
the
camp
fire
jarvis
and
josephine
exchanged
a
brief
conversation
is
he
taking
it
worse
or
better
than
you
expected
josephine
asked
in
the
lowest
of
whispers
he
took
it
like
the
bumptious
idiot
he
can
be
at
first
he
a
trifle
calmer
now
i
hoping
by
morning
he
be
reasonable
do
you
think
he
must
see
the
beauty
of
it
when
he
looks
at
sally
one
would
think
so
i
suppose
we
must
blame
him
too
much
for
he
certainly
is
worn
out
with
work
in
this
heat
and
is
himself
if
only
be
sensible
the
staying
here
will
do
him
as
much
good
as
it
will
sally
she
is
pleased
is
she
pleased
does
express
it
but
she
thinks
it
all
my
doing
do
let
her
think
anything
else
it
was
your
suggestion
and
done
half
the
work
it
was
mr
ferry
suggestion
did
you
know
he
put
up
that
rustic
bench
out
there
this
afternoon
made
it
out
of
the
tree
he
chopped
down
i
did
stop
to
wonder
how
it
came
there
i
wonder
if
max
noticed
it
i
suppose
he
will
think
that
was
more
of
our
impudence
it
was
kind
of
ferry
though
he
be
a
good
neighbour
for
them
oh
jarvis
how
i
wish
we
could
all
stay
here
too
her
brother
gave
vent
to
a
curious
little
ejaculation
whether
of
agreement
or
dissent
she
could
not
tell
of
course
we
ca
he
said
shortly
perhaps
max
will
come
round
and
ask
us
to
put
up
another
tent
for
ourselves
not
much
he
wo
never
mind
i
satisfied
if
he
submits
to
this
when
max
opened
his
eyes
the
next
morning
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
realize
where
he
was
he
lay
staring
at
the
flecks
of
sunlight
on
the
ground
wondering
how
it
happened
that
he
had
not
wakened
in
damp
discomfort
from
hot
and
perspiring
slumbers
before
he
felt
himself
fully
awake
he
was
conscious
of
a
voice
a
few
feet
away
exclaiming
oh
mr
ferry
how
kind
of
you
what
splendid
strawberries
out
of
your
own
garden
you
must
be
an
accomplished
gardener
it
was
josephine
voice
only
a
novice
but
i
rather
proud
of
these
i
hope
the
first
night
was
a
comfortable
one
perfect
our
friends
are
still
sleeping
though
they
wo
be
long
if
i
shout
like
this
i
been
up
so
long
i
did
realize
it
was
barely
seven
but
i
wanted
to
make
sure
of
your
having
these
for
the
first
camp
breakfast
i
disappear
now
and
perhaps
i
can
venture
to
appear
again
later
in
the
day
with
my
mother
we
want
to
offer
our
services
as
neighbours
from
whom
anything
from
axes
to
apricots
can
be
borrowed
max
could
hear
josephine
low
laugh
echoed
by
a
small
ecstatic
chuckle
from
the
other
side
of
the
canvas
wall
which
separated
his
head
from
sally
her
whisper
came
from
very
near
his
ear
max
are
you
awake
did
you
hear
what
jo
said
we
to
have
fresh
strawberries
right
out
of
a
garden
for
breakfast
are
you
glad
you
alive
where
was
his
he
felt
for
it
in
the
recesses
of
his
inner
man
and
could
seem
to
find
it
he
had
had
nine
long
hours
of
refreshing
sleep
in
the
purest
air
to
be
found
in
the
country
and
had
wakened
with
a
sense
of
refreshment
and
such
as
he
had
not
experienced
in
many
months
a
faint
but
appetizing
odour
of
cookery
including
that
of
fragrant
coffee
was
in
the
air
and
there
were
to
be
freshly
picked
strawberries
for
breakfast
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
tent
wall
was
a
happy
young
convalescent
demanding
of
him
whether
it
was
not
good
to
be
alive
he
found
himself
answering
in
a
genuinely
cheerful
tone
i
certainly
mighty
glad
you
alive
sally
lunn
chapter
vii
everybody
is
satisfied
bobby
let
have
a
garden
you
and
i
bob
looked
up
from
the
front
of
the
tent
platform
where
he
sat
polishing
a
pair
of
russet
shoes
riding
back
and
forth
nights
and
mornings
on
a
bicycle
over
very
dusty
roads
made
it
necessary
to
polish
often
but
bob
did
mind
the
two
weeks
of
camp
life
he
had
enjoyed
had
made
him
indifferent
to
any
extra
trouble
involved
looks
as
if
you
had
a
garden
somewhere
he
responded
eyeing
with
favour
the
pailful
of
red
raspberries
sally
held
up
you
must
have
got
up
with
the
lark
to
have
picked
all
those
mary
ann
has
more
than
started
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
tent
i
had
to
go
and
help
her
that
girl
does
know
how
to
boil
an
egg
she
cracks
it
getting
it
in
her
coffee
is
a
thick
dark
wicked
looking
stuff
what
do
you
suppose
she
does
to
it
he
asked
in
a
whisper
never
mind
i
growing
stronger
every
minute
and
mean
to
begin
to
cook
next
week
thank
goodness
murmured
bob
i
mean
he
explained
quickly
that
i
thankful
you
well
enough
sally
laughed
pulled
off
her
wide
straw
hat
and
sat
down
beside
bob
your
cheeks
are
pink
as
hollyhocks
he
observed
eyeing
her
with
satisfaction
i
had
a
lovely
time
picking
those
raspberries
she
said
there
must
have
been
a
big
patch
of
them
back
there
once
bob
i
want
to
start
a
kitchen
garden
max
and
alec
have
waked
up
yet
to
the
fun
it
would
be
to
grow
things
on
this
old
place
but
you
always
awake
come
on
bob
stood
up
i
ready
for
anything
you
say
but
i
do
know
any
more
about
planting
gardens
than
i
do
about
building
bridges
you
do
plant
a
garden
in
july
i
sure
of
that
is
there
a
thing
that
can
go
in
late
and
produce
a
late
crop
do
ask
me
maybe
our
friend
ferry
would
know
if
there
anything
he
does
know
i
have
found
it
out
it
funny
a
preacher
should
be
such
an
sort
of
fellow
is
it
a
what
sally
nearly
dropped
her
raspberries
she
was
so
astonished
a
preacher
he
preaches
in
the
old
white
church
with
the
big
pillars
away
down
town
in
the
middle
of
everything
i
just
found
it
out
yesterday
from
a
fellow
in
the
office
why
it
ca
be
he
always
busy
round
that
garden
or
chopping
wood
up
in
our
timber
tract
he
asked
max
to
let
him
work
at
that
for
the
sake
of
his
muscle
he
said
if
you
just
stop
and
think
you
find
he
is
round
all
the
time
he
in
the
city
every
day
has
to
be
he
holds
a
noon
service
in
the
old
church
every
day
in
the
week
for
men
fred
kentner
says
they
flock
in
there
like
sheep
says
he
goes
in
often
it
cool
in
there
and
he
likes
the
things
ferry
says
i
going
in
with
fred
some
day
soon
like
to
find
out
what
a
fellow
that
can
chop
trees
and
fight
with
his
fists
can
find
to
say
in
a
pulpit
fight
with
his
fists
bob
chuckled
i
tackled
him
the
other
evening
out
behind
his
house
just
for
fun
i
got
all
i
wanted
in
about
two
minutes
he
was
laughing
all
the
time
but
i
could
get
near
him
he
laid
me
on
my
back
as
helpless
as
a
baby
say
if
mary
ann
does
get
round
with
the
oatmeal
pretty
soon
i
have
to
go
without
it
twenty
minutes
past
six
now
i
see
about
it
and
sally
hurried
away
revolving
in
her
mind
this
astonishing
news
he
ca
be
as
young
as
he
looks
then
she
said
to
herself
i
should
say
he
was
a
minute
over
but
he
must
be
her
mind
turned
later
that
day
to
a
project
more
immediately
promising
than
the
garden
she
wanted
to
have
a
house
party
a
tent
party
to
be
accurate
the
burnsides
had
driven
out
twice
to
see
them
since
they
had
become
established
but
jarvis
had
been
having
another
siege
with
his
eyes
and
josephine
had
been
entertaining
visitors
sally
in
the
strength
and
enthusiasm
of
returning
health
longed
for
her
friends
and
began
to
plan
how
she
could
have
all
three
with
her
for
the
space
of
at
least
two
days
wait
a
little
longer
counselled
uncle
timothy
your
strength
is
more
that
of
happiness
than
of
real
physical
gain
though
you
are
certainly
acquiring
health
rapidly
there
will
be
plenty
of
hot
weather
in
august
and
you
will
be
better
fit
to
exert
yourself
max
and
alec
backed
him
for
they
were
still
more
or
less
indifferent
to
the
charms
of
active
exercise
and
when
they
had
been
fed
each
evening
were
in
the
habit
of
falling
into
postures
of
ease
on
the
ground
before
the
tent
while
they
discussed
the
happenings
of
the
day
at
the
end
of
another
fortnight
however
everybody
admitted
that
sally
seemed
enough
like
herself
to
be
permitted
the
mild
dissipation
of
a
tent
party
and
she
proceeded
joyfully
to
plan
for
the
occasion
alec
and
bob
will
have
to
sleep
outside
she
decided
thank
you
not
for
me
said
alec
oh
do
go
and
be
a
now
al
cried
bob
i
a
good
deal
rather
sleep
outdoors
than
not
you
have
my
permission
rejoined
alec
i
will
sleep
with
pleasure
said
uncle
timothy
never
if
i
give
you
my
room
and
sally
looked
indignant
i
should
enjoy
it
rudd
insisted
this
life
has
renewed
my
youth
if
the
weather
is
favourable
during
your
friends
visit
you
can
count
on
having
my
room
for
them
of
course
alec
could
not
allow
such
a
reversal
of
the
natural
order
of
things
and
he
announced
the
fact
with
firmness
mixed
with
irritation
uncle
timothy
however
also
persisted
went
into
town
and
bought
a
hammock
and
returning
hung
it
under
the
trees
sally
with
the
help
of
mary
ann
did
considerable
preliminary
baking
and
the
ferrys
hearing
of
the
coming
event
contributed
a
large
basketful
of
garden
produce
sally
running
over
to
thank
mrs
ferry
told
her
all
about
her
plans
she
had
already
grown
very
fond
of
the
little
lady
whose
happiness
at
being
with
her
son
after
a
long
period
of
separation
from
him
made
her
a
cheery
companion
i
hope
you
and
mr
ferry
will
come
over
this
evening
urged
sally
we
want
to
make
it
a
jolly
time
for
our
friends
and
i
sure
you
enjoy
knowing
mrs
burnside
mother
a
little
shy
said
a
voice
from
behind
mrs
ferry
who
stood
in
the
small
porch
looking
down
at
her
visitor
sally
in
a
crisp
frock
of
white
with
tiny
black
figures
her
sunny
head
uplifted
and
her
cheeks
now
round
and
rosy
with
returning
health
looked
past
mrs
ferry
shoulder
smiling
she
is
decidedly
modest
about
showing
off
before
people
but
she
could
entertain
your
guests
quite
by
herself
if
she
would
donald
the
small
lady
faced
about
as
her
son
arm
came
round
her
shoulders
what
an
idea
she
the
finest
reader
in
the
state
asserted
the
young
man
she
a
scholar
she
donald
you
will
lose
your
car
she
taught
me
all
i
know
and
a
great
deal
more
that
i
do
know
because
my
head
would
hold
it
still
the
wonder
grew
that
one
small
head
could
carry
all
she
knew
now
i
shall
have
to
run
for
it
which
will
be
most
undignified
mother
he
kissed
her
miss
sally
we
be
there
he
swung
away
down
the
road
at
a
brisk
pace
turning
once
to
wave
his
hat
at
the
figure
on
the
porch
such
a
boy
breathed
the
mother
yet
such
a
man
miss
sally
though
his
mother
says
it
and
he
go
off
with
all
that
nonsense
on
his
lips
and
a
head
full
of
talk
for
those
men
in
the
church
at
noon
talk
that
will
go
straight
to
their
hearts
and
better
to
their
judgments
i
have
yet
been
able
to
realize
that
he
a
minister
sally
ventured
somehow
seeing
him
here
mrs
ferry
nodded
i
know
nobody
takes
him
for
what
he
is
because
he
will
not
do
what
he
calls
the
part
every
day
and
he
is
such
a
believer
in
making
the
physical
life
offset
the
mental
and
spiritual
if
i
may
put
it
so
that
i
tell
him
he
may
be
in
danger
of
becoming
so
athletic
and
so
agricultural
she
smiled
that
he
will
crowd
out
the
spiritual
yet
he
knows
i
do
mean
that
he
turns
up
many
a
rich
nugget
of
thought
when
he
is
hoeing
the
ground
and
chops
down
many
an
error
when
he
fells
a
tree
perhaps
i
do
doubt
it
agreed
sally
regarding
the
proud
little
mother
with
real
envy
of
her
fortunate
son
please
come
over
early
she
begged
as
she
took
her
leave
after
lingering
a
little
to
tell
mrs
ferry
more
about
her
plans
for
the
evening
sally
lunn
josephine
exclaimed
a
few
hours
later
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
you
never
looked
so
well
behold
her
jarvis
but
do
dare
take
off
your
blue
goggles
her
radiance
is
fairly
dazzling
and
is
liable
to
blind
you
it
partly
sunburn
confessed
sally
i
go
deliberately
out
and
let
the
sun
smite
me
first
on
the
right
cheek
and
then
on
the
left
for
awhile
i
burned
my
nose
at
the
same
time
which
was
not
picturesque
but
now
i
put
a
thick
coating
of
talcum
powder
on
my
nose
and
burn
myself
only
where
it
is
artistic
there
an
honest
confession
for
you
and
jarvis
shook
hands
so
heartily
that
sally
fingers
ached
for
a
minute
afterward
i
can
see
some
of
the
rouge
through
my
glasses
i
must
look
purple
to
you
then
red
and
blue
make
purple
on
cheeks
as
well
as
palettes
do
they
joey
what
made
you
put
on
a
white
dress
i
planned
to
take
you
all
blackberrying
over
in
the
pasture
lovely
lend
me
an
apron
and
i
risk
the
dress
this
is
a
beautiful
time
of
day
to
pick
blackberries
the
three
set
off
as
they
passed
the
garden
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hedge
they
were
hailed
by
donald
ferry
may
i
go
too
called
the
young
man
and
he
leaped
lightly
over
the
hedge
jarvis
burnside
went
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
i
heard
you
speak
this
noon
he
said
in
a
low
tone
ferry
returned
the
pressure
heartily
i
saw
you
he
answered
you
did
i
was
away
back
by
the
door
my
eyes
are
pretty
good
and
it
easy
to
see
a
friend
you
know
i
be
glad
to
have
you
call
me
that
said
jarvis
i
wanted
to
since
i
saw
you
first
replied
ferry
with
the
simplicity
of
manner
which
won
him
confidence
and
warm
liking
wherever
he
went
he
was
in
a
holiday
mood
he
insisted
on
carrying
all
the
pails
and
juggled
with
them
producing
a
clash
of
sound
which
echoed
through
the
meadows
in
his
gray
flannels
and
flowing
blue
tie
he
looked
much
more
like
a
college
boy
than
a
member
of
the
most
dignified
of
professions
how
strong
and
healthy
he
looks
observed
jarvis
to
sally
as
they
led
the
way
toward
the
blackberry
pasture
he
could
have
got
his
education
without
spending
more
or
less
time
but
he
must
have
put
in
every
spare
minute
in
the
open
air
the
sight
of
him
makes
me
feel
more
than
ever
that
i
was
a
fool
to
dig
away
as
i
did
ruining
my
eyes
for
the
sake
of
doing
two
years
work
in
one
gained
a
lot
did
i
do
you
realize
it
more
than
a
year
since
i
took
my
degree
and
not
a
blessed
thing
since
but
idle
around
waiting
for
these
eyes
to
get
back
into
shape
it
must
have
seemed
a
long
year
agreed
sally
sympathetically
but
have
you
made
things
worse
by
using
your
eyes
every
now
and
then
against
orders
guilty
the
sight
of
a
book
is
like
cheese
to
a
mouse
to
me
just
after
a
visit
to
doctor
meyer
i
meek
and
obedient
as
a
lamb
then
i
pass
a
look
in
at
the
windows
glance
round
to
see
if
any
oculists
or
mothers
observe
me
dodge
in
get
into
a
corner
with
some
book
and
an
hour
is
gone
before
i
think
i
done
more
than
inspect
the
table
of
contents
i
knew
you
must
be
breaking
rules
when
you
had
so
many
relapses
after
jo
had
said
the
eyes
were
better
it
a
pity
you
live
in
a
stone
block
instead
of
a
place
like
this
where
there
is
enough
to
keep
any
one
busy
it
is
a
pity
i
wish
we
lived
on
a
farm
like
this
i
like
nothing
better
than
trying
my
hand
at
scientific
farming
if
i
going
to
be
everlastingly
handicapped
by
these
eyes
i
might
as
well
look
round
for
an
job
you
ca
think
how
i
wish
now
i
put
in
my
time
studying
civil
engineering
i
thought
scientific
farming
called
for
lots
of
reading
it
does
properly
i
should
have
to
have
a
partner
to
do
the
studying
but
it
also
calls
for
plenty
of
work
and
that
well
getting
to
have
more
and
more
attraction
for
me
look
up
the
pasture
there
is
that
a
beautiful
scene
at
this
hour
of
day
even
through
blue
glasses
if
max
only
felt
as
you
do
but
do
you
think
he
looking
better
since
he
been
sleeping
out
here
he
actually
owned
this
morning
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
get
back
in
time
for
the
blackberry
picking
really
the
old
boy
must
be
waking
up
a
bit
i
thinking
of
offering
to
rent
a
few
acres
out
here
so
as
to
start
a
next
spring
if
my
eyes
still
need
favouring
and
there
not
much
doubt
of
that
perhaps
the
sight
of
me
digging
round
here
will
stir
him
up
if
it
only
would
oh
jarvis
how
i
love
to
spend
the
winter
in
that
house
and
sally
turned
to
gaze
back
at
it
would
you
clear
off
out
here
among
the
well
i
could
imagine
myself
doing
it
with
enthusiasm
under
two
conditions
the
use
of
my
eyes
and
the
use
of
the
library
at
the
top
of
those
stairs
by
the
way
has
max
taken
any
steps
to
sell
that
he
been
consulting
a
man
or
two
and
he
had
one
out
here
not
long
ago
i
begged
him
to
be
careful
if
he
must
sell
it
lest
he
should
get
all
it
worth
he
better
be
mighty
careful
i
wish
he
trust
me
with
that
commission
i
believe
i
mention
it
to
him
i
understood
he
did
intend
to
do
anything
about
it
at
present
but
if
he
has
his
mind
on
selling
it
i
must
have
a
word
with
him
i
believe
the
collection
is
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
any
of
us
appreciate
jarvis
did
not
fail
to
follow
up
this
idea
when
the
party
returned
to
the
tent
max
was
coming
from
the
house
jarvis
talked
with
him
for
some
time
and
the
conference
ended
with
both
of
them
looking
cheerful
max
was
undoubtedly
feeling
the
benefit
of
his
taste
of
life
he
joined
in
the
festivities
of
the
evening
with
more
zest
than
he
had
shown
in
a
long
time
greatly
to
the
delight
of
everybody
it
was
a
merry
evening
and
was
followed
by
much
jollity
over
the
bestowing
of
so
many
people
comfortably
for
the
night
going
to
occupy
his
hammock
rudd
found
a
long
figure
swinging
reposefully
in
it
why
jarvis
he
ejaculated
this
is
my
place
you
are
to
have
a
room
in
the
tent
not
while
you
sleep
outside
sir
returned
the
guest
remaining
composed
for
slumber
beside
i
do
get
a
chance
to
sleep
outdoors
very
often
and
on
such
a
night
as
this
i
would
miss
it
i
do
suppose
i
can
forcibly
eject
you
admitted
rudd
no
i
think
not
i
may
not
be
as
muscular
as
our
friend
ferry
but
i
have
given
up
my
morning
exercise
before
my
cold
plunge
since
i
left
college
and
i
in
fair
shape
to
hold
my
own
with
whoever
attempts
to
take
this
hammock
away
from
me
go
back
to
your
room
please
rudd
i
never
was
more
comfortable
in
my
life
to
prove
it
jarvis
went
promptly
to
sleep
and
nearly
every
one
else
did
the
same
burnside
was
awake
for
some
time
but
she
too
fell
asleep
at
last
leaving
only
one
pair
of
eyes
in
the
tent
sally
for
some
unknown
reason
could
not
feel
the
first
inclination
to
repose
she
was
up
and
sitting
on
a
pillow
beside
her
open
tent
flap
gazing
out
into
the
night
when
she
heard
a
singular
noise
it
was
like
the
distant
roar
of
the
sea
but
there
was
no
sea
within
many
miles
it
did
not
sound
in
the
least
like
wind
yet
wind
it
must
be
she
thought
and
in
the
space
of
a
half
minute
the
roar
had
so
gained
in
volume
that
it
appeared
to
be
approaching
with
great
rapidity
sally
rose
and
peered
up
toward
the
sky
for
usually
she
could
see
a
small
patch
of
it
beyond
the
grove
but
she
could
discern
no
appearance
of
the
sky
although
a
few
minutes
before
the
stars
had
been
shining
brilliantly
she
had
no
time
within
which
to
take
any
further
observations
before
she
had
fairly
begun
to
wonder
what
might
be
coming
and
to
tell
herself
that
she
had
heard
no
growl
of
thunder
and
that
therefore
this
could
not
be
the
approach
of
one
of
those
severe
electrical
storms
with
which
a
period
of
intense
heat
sometimes
terminates
the
thing
had
happened
with
a
burst
a
tremendous
blast
of
wind
struck
the
tent
it
swayed
and
strained
at
its
the
poles
creaked
and
cracked
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
whole
flapping
structure
had
gone
down
with
one
ballooning
heave
flat
upon
the
ground
covering
its
inmates
with
billowing
canvas
then
came
a
terrific
clap
of
thunder
and
a
flash
of
the
fiercest
lightning
sally
had
ever
seen
instantly
there
was
a
sudden
and
overwhelming
downpour
of
rain
as
if
the
heavens
had
opened
then
everybody
was
shouting
or
calling
outside
the
tent
jarvis
in
his
hammock
and
bob
on
his
blankets
on
the
ground
had
been
soaked
to
the
skin
before
they
knew
what
had
happened
and
were
trying
to
discover
a
place
where
they
could
crawl
under
the
wrecked
canvas
and
find
a
shelter
from
the
deluge
where
are
you
all
anybody
hurt
cried
jarvis
groping
in
the
blackness
all
right
screamed
josephine
who
had
put
her
hand
under
the
canvas
partition
and
found
her
mother
whose
bed
was
next
her
own
all
right
shrieked
sally
who
had
received
a
soaking
by
having
been
close
to
the
open
when
the
flood
came
but
she
did
not
mention
that
just
now
here
a
place
to
get
under
cried
bob
to
jarvis
and
the
two
managed
to
work
themselves
under
cover
a
convenient
table
made
a
nook
to
receive
them
and
kept
the
tent
off
their
heads
i
crawled
under
my
cot
announced
alec
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
so
have
i
called
rudd
he
was
congratulating
himself
that
he
had
not
slept
in
the
hammock
but
he
was
much
worried
concerning
jarvis
and
bob
then
max
fired
the
shot
that
sooner
or
later
he
might
have
been
expected
to
fire
as
loudly
as
he
could
vociferate
against
the
roar
of
the
storm
he
sent
a
triumphant
challenge
to
the
party
i
hope
all
with
the
beauty
of
sleeping
in
the
chapter
viii
problems
and
hearts
the
storm
had
passed
almost
as
abruptly
as
it
had
come
the
rain
ceased
as
if
a
in
the
heavens
had
been
suddenly
closed
the
wind
had
gone
when
the
rain
came
so
that
the
moment
the
downfall
was
over
the
whole
affair
was
ended
it
had
not
occupied
the
space
of
more
than
four
minutes
but
it
had
managed
to
make
as
complete
a
wreck
of
the
sleeping
arrangements
in
the
pine
grove
as
if
it
had
been
of
an
hour
duration
the
stars
are
shining
announced
bob
putting
his
head
under
the
edge
of
the
canvas
the
moment
the
rain
had
stopped
the
show
is
over
so
is
the
tent
and
sleep
added
alec
crawling
along
under
the
wreckage
he
had
encountered
bob
heel
this
is
a
nice
mess
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
now
get
everybody
out
under
the
sky
commanded
jarvis
working
his
way
out
he
ran
round
to
the
back
of
the
tent
and
found
sally
emerging
he
gave
her
a
hand
why
you
wet
he
said
as
his
hand
touched
the
sleeve
of
the
blue
kimono
she
had
been
wearing
when
she
sat
in
the
open
doorway
she
felt
of
his
sleeve
in
turn
i
not
a
circumstance
to
you
she
answered
you
must
be
soaked
to
the
skin
you
and
bob
that
no
matter
this
warm
night
mother
jo
where
are
you
max
lend
a
hand
here
and
let
lift
this
canvas
so
they
can
get
out
but
it
not
a
warm
night
now
declared
burnside
when
she
had
reached
the
open
air
and
had
found
out
for
herself
how
wet
at
least
three
of
the
party
were
we
must
manage
to
dry
you
all
somehow
i
hope
you
people
are
satisfied
max
reiterated
it
was
the
fourth
time
he
had
said
it
of
course
we
satisfied
cried
sally
with
spirit
who
wants
a
camping
party
without
any
adventures
we
ca
have
bears
here
in
our
pine
grove
so
we
have
thunderstorms
thunderstorms
that
was
a
cyclone
if
it
was
anything
growled
max
if
it
was
we
safe
from
ever
having
another
cried
bob
they
never
hit
the
same
place
twice
i
told
hello
there
comes
a
lantern
through
the
hedge
thought
mr
ferry
be
looking
us
up
ship
ahoy
called
a
hailing
voice
all
hands
on
deck
shall
i
man
a
lifeboat
well
well
in
astonishment
as
he
came
nearer
where
are
you
anyhow
where
the
tent
do
look
so
high
up
jarvis
called
back
lower
your
glass
to
the
horizon
line
we
out
in
the
open
sea
ferry
surveyed
the
group
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
anybody
get
wet
he
asked
yes
i
should
say
you
did
see
here
you
wet
ones
do
delay
a
minute
for
the
storm
has
made
the
air
twenty
degrees
cooler
run
over
to
our
house
mother
expecting
you
all
we
ca
all
get
inside
your
house
chuckled
bob
let
go
into
our
own
urged
sally
max
has
the
key
and
we
can
carry
in
the
cots
they
not
wet
and
have
a
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
bob
pinched
her
arm
say
sis
it
a
chance
for
you
to
get
into
the
house
of
course
it
is
sally
whispered
back
her
eyes
dancing
in
the
light
from
the
lantern
i
think
that
is
the
best
plan
do
you
max
questioned
jarvis
max
nodded
reluctantly
no
matter
how
hospitably
the
tiny
cottage
might
be
thrown
open
for
their
reception
it
would
certainly
be
overtaxing
its
capacity
to
attempt
to
make
nine
extra
people
comfortable
there
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
it
was
barely
one
we
gladly
stretch
the
walls
to
take
you
all
in
said
donald
ferry
but
perhaps
the
big
house
plan
is
the
better
suppose
you
ladies
go
over
and
let
mother
satisfy
her
longing
to
be
of
use
by
making
miss
sally
dry
while
we
fellows
get
the
cots
into
the
house
and
bring
over
some
wood
from
our
pile
for
the
fireplace
it
will
need
open
windows
and
a
rousing
fire
in
there
to
freshen
the
musty
air
jarvis
you
must
come
too
you
and
bob
you
both
very
wet
urged
burnside
yes
go
over
burnside
and
ask
mother
for
some
dry
clothes
of
mine
said
ferry
bob
i
got
some
dry
clothes
packed
away
somewhere
in
the
tent
if
i
can
only
find
where
they
gone
to
answered
bob
i
work
myself
dry
and
jarvis
suited
the
action
to
the
word
by
beginning
to
unfasten
the
guy
ropes
jarvis
it
was
his
mother
voice
at
the
note
in
it
he
stood
up
again
laughing
all
right
mother
he
agreed
and
walked
away
with
her
toward
the
cottage
these
people
who
have
been
so
anxious
to
camp
said
max
to
ferry
i
hope
they
satisfied
now
oh
such
experiences
are
a
part
of
the
fun
of
camping
asserted
ferry
rudd
certainly
looks
cheerful
and
he
held
up
his
lantern
so
that
its
rays
illumined
uncle
timothy
face
the
elder
man
smiled
it
seems
to
me
we
are
fortunate
to
have
had
no
worse
happen
said
he
that
was
the
most
violent
wind
i
have
ever
known
it
shook
our
little
house
to
its
foundations
replied
ferry
i
think
it
took
down
a
chimney
but
i
did
stop
to
find
out
mother
was
certain
your
camp
must
be
blown
over
into
the
next
township
and
could
hardly
wait
for
me
to
get
out
and
see
well
shall
we
go
to
work
tent
down
first
and
that
will
take
all
hands
for
wet
canvas
is
heavy
they
fell
to
jarvis
soon
returning
to
join
them
it
took
considerable
time
to
remove
the
tent
from
its
position
for
much
care
was
necessary
to
prevent
its
dampening
the
tent
furniture
beneath
but
after
that
it
was
easy
to
move
the
cots
and
bedding
to
the
house
the
hallway
of
which
was
now
lighted
by
two
lamps
brought
over
from
the
cottage
we
make
up
the
beds
cried
sally
appearing
with
josephine
in
the
big
hall
her
face
radiant
i
ca
lose
any
more
time
tamely
discussing
this
event
over
there
when
i
can
be
here
in
the
midst
of
things
good
for
you
now
bob
suppose
you
and
i
leave
the
others
to
bring
over
the
rest
of
the
stuff
while
we
haul
some
wood
for
the
fireplace
and
ferry
beckoned
bob
away
to
the
next
job
he
was
smiling
back
at
sally
as
he
went
for
her
joy
though
he
did
not
quite
understand
its
cause
was
contagious
so
it
was
not
long
before
a
cheerful
blaze
was
throwing
grotesque
lights
and
shadows
down
the
hall
showing
up
the
odd
array
of
cots
and
beds
which
had
been
brought
without
regard
to
final
disposition
into
the
hall
sally
selected
the
long
room
on
the
left
of
the
hall
its
doorway
directly
opposite
the
fireplace
for
the
feminine
portion
of
the
family
announcing
that
the
others
could
sleep
in
the
hall
itself
into
this
room
she
directed
uncle
timothy
and
alec
to
move
four
of
the
cots
and
set
mary
ann
at
work
making
up
the
beds
in
the
hall
is
this
more
fun
than
the
jolliest
picnic
you
ever
went
to
exulted
sally
as
she
and
josephine
spread
sheets
and
blankets
upon
the
beds
it
great
i
so
glad
it
happened
when
we
were
here
sally
do
you
suppose
they
can
dry
the
tent
and
get
it
up
again
by
night
i
hope
not
if
it
would
only
rain
again
i
give
worlds
to
be
forced
to
stay
here
in
the
house
much
as
i
enjoyed
sleeping
in
the
tent
if
i
could
only
make
max
take
a
little
liking
to
the
house
and
i
could
if
i
just
had
our
things
out
here
from
town
but
of
course
he
never
let
me
has
he
been
funny
with
his
solemn
we
satisfied
oh
if
the
poor
dear
only
had
just
a
tiny
sense
of
humour
i
sure
he
has
if
we
could
wake
it
up
this
scene
ought
to
do
it
if
anything
would
agreed
josephine
look
at
rudd
with
his
hair
all
rumpled
and
his
still
on
see
mary
ann
out
there
she
look
dazed
and
serious
here
i
am
with
my
hair
in
two
tails
down
my
back
and
it
the
first
time
i
thought
of
it
as
for
you
in
that
red
sweater
jacket
with
your
curly
mop
of
hair
you
look
more
like
a
lively
small
boy
than
ever
before
i
like
to
be
one
do
you
suppose
we
can
ever
settle
down
to
slumber
again
i
like
to
have
larks
the
rest
of
the
time
till
morning
we
will
have
them
night
joey
burnside
if
we
can
manage
to
stay
in
this
house
it
certainly
was
hard
to
get
to
sleep
under
these
new
conditions
even
after
everybody
was
quiet
there
were
still
sources
of
amusement
for
sally
the
sound
of
a
low
growl
in
the
hall
was
enough
to
set
her
off
and
she
leaned
over
to
josephine
cot
to
whisper
that
max
muttering
hope
you
satisfied
at
which
josephine
began
to
laugh
and
the
two
shook
together
for
some
time
thereafter
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
of
which
josephine
was
conscious
was
sally
again
breathing
joyously
in
her
ear
jo
jo
it
raining
so
it
was
the
long
dry
spell
had
been
broken
by
the
severe
storm
of
the
night
and
a
heavy
rain
was
now
falling
as
she
dressed
sally
gazed
out
upon
it
with
satisfaction
how
on
earth
are
we
to
have
any
breakfast
came
booming
from
the
hall
as
max
reluctantly
getting
to
his
feet
took
in
the
situation
mr
ferry
and
i
brought
all
the
kitchen
tent
stuff
into
the
back
of
this
house
said
bob
he
said
it
was
best
in
time
of
peace
to
prepare
for
war
and
we
might
get
another
storm
before
morning
so
we
all
fixed
very
nice
for
those
who
can
stay
here
but
not
so
fine
for
the
ones
who
have
to
catch
the
trolley
max
applied
himself
discontentedly
to
the
business
of
dressing
oh
what
that
who
minds
a
little
walk
in
the
rain
i
would
be
such
a
granny
you
done
nothing
but
fuss
ever
since
the
tent
came
down
nobody
else
has
howled
a
minute
you
must
enjoy
being
everlastingly
in
a
grouch
it
was
not
often
that
bob
good
humour
forsook
him
to
the
point
of
addressing
his
elder
brother
in
such
disrespectful
terms
and
max
glared
at
him
wrathfully
cut
that
i
a
few
years
older
than
you
are
and
you
no
business
to
be
impudent
when
you
work
the
way
i
do
you
earn
the
right
to
have
your
rest
undisturbed
yes
grandpa
mocked
bob
alec
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
cot
laughed
this
was
too
much
for
max
he
seized
his
younger
brother
by
the
collar
and
attempted
to
shake
him
but
bob
was
more
athletic
than
max
had
realized
the
sturdy
young
figure
resisted
doughtily
and
max
who
was
by
no
means
muscular
found
his
hands
full
uncle
timothy
and
alec
looked
on
in
amusement
as
the
battle
raged
and
when
bob
finally
succeeded
in
depositing
max
on
the
latter
own
cot
back
downward
the
victor
knee
on
the
conquered
one
chest
they
applauded
heartily
take
it
nephew
advised
rudd
catching
sight
of
max
angry
countenance
it
was
a
fair
encounter
and
the
lad
is
stronger
than
you
if
there
was
any
way
of
pounding
a
laugh
into
maxwell
lane
i
tackle
him
myself
declared
alec
boys
what
are
you
doing
called
sally
are
you
dressed
may
we
come
through
we
want
to
help
mary
ann
about
breakfast
max
rose
to
his
feet
his
face
red
and
his
collar
awry
as
the
girls
appeared
he
strode
away
up
the
stairs
affecting
not
to
see
them
max
are
you
going
up
to
find
out
if
any
burglars
got
in
overnight
called
sally
after
him
if
you
are
please
see
if
my
jewel
case
is
undisturbed
to
sally
intense
gratification
it
rained
all
day
to
be
sure
she
had
invited
her
friends
to
a
tent
party
not
to
stay
in
an
empty
house
but
it
seemed
to
be
so
much
more
fun
for
everybody
to
roam
about
the
house
exploring
it
from
attic
to
cellar
suggesting
what
could
be
done
to
make
it
all
inviting
and
attractive
that
the
hours
by
no
means
dragged
burnside
especially
seemed
to
take
deep
interest
in
every
detail
of
the
rooms
declaring
them
to
be
susceptible
to
treatment
which
should
easily
make
them
homelike
and
beautiful
the
rugs
from
the
tent
had
been
laid
in
the
hall
by
the
fireplace
where
a
small
fire
burned
its
cheer
and
warmth
grateful
to
those
who
gathered
round
it
for
the
change
in
the
weather
had
become
more
pronounced
as
the
day
advanced
and
a
wind
was
doing
its
part
in
making
indoors
desirable
such
of
the
camp
furniture
as
fitted
the
uses
of
a
had
also
been
placed
in
the
hall
and
the
result
was
that
at
least
one
spot
in
the
big
house
presented
a
highly
inviting
appearance
i
wish
we
had
some
books
and
magazines
now
said
josephine
disposing
herself
comfortably
in
a
steamer
chair
with
her
back
toward
the
fire
i
read
all
those
we
had
in
the
tent
i
find
you
some
and
sally
disappeared
by
way
of
the
kitchen
where
mary
ann
was
sure
to
need
coaching
from
time
to
time
thence
she
ran
up
a
back
stairway
to
the
floor
above
and
on
to
the
small
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
door
opening
on
the
stairway
between
the
walls
above
which
was
the
old
library
she
meant
to
make
a
selection
of
volumes
for
josephine
delectation
more
as
a
joke
than
as
an
offer
of
reading
matter
for
she
did
not
suppose
there
was
much
in
the
collection
which
might
serve
to
entertain
her
friend
to
her
surprise
she
found
it
unnecessary
to
use
her
key
and
went
on
up
the
stairs
remembering
that
she
had
not
seen
jarvis
for
the
last
hour
if
he
should
be
up
here
reading
it
was
well
that
she
had
come
for
the
fine
print
of
the
old
books
was
the
worst
thing
possible
for
his
eyes
but
jarvis
was
not
reading
instead
she
found
him
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
staring
out
through
the
curious
old
latticework
which
after
the
fashion
in
many
old
houses
made
the
upper
windows
impregnable
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
outlook
of
field
and
meadow
stretching
away
up
the
slope
of
the
hillside
to
the
woods
beyond
it
was
a
fine
prospect
even
through
the
falling
rain
and
jarvis
appeared
to
be
fascinated
by
it
so
that
he
did
not
hear
the
light
fall
of
sally
footsteps
on
the
stairs
she
came
softly
up
and
stood
beside
him
is
that
lovely
off
there
she
asked
and
jarvis
started
then
he
laughed
bringing
his
gaze
back
to
rest
with
a
look
of
pleasure
upon
the
girl
at
his
side
it
certainly
is
from
this
height
one
gets
a
better
idea
of
the
way
the
farm
lies
than
from
below
do
you
wonder
i
want
to
live
here
not
a
bit
the
idea
of
it
grows
more
attractive
to
me
every
time
i
come
here
if
it
were
any
place
but
yours
i
should
be
strongly
tempted
to
buy
it
myself
mother
and
i
of
course
i
mean
she
would
jump
at
the
idea
i
fancy
of
this
for
a
summer
home
oh
jarvis
sally
looked
so
dismayed
that
he
reassured
her
in
haste
of
course
i
never
mention
such
a
thing
unless
you
yourself
wanted
to
sell
but
you
can
see
i
in
sympathy
with
your
longing
to
live
here
i
only
wish
i
could
see
you
carry
out
your
plan
if
there
were
anything
i
could
do
to
bring
it
about
i
certainly
would
do
it
look
here
he
paused
to
consider
an
idea
which
had
just
occurred
to
him
do
you
suppose
if
i
were
seriously
to
talk
of
buying
the
place
it
might
make
max
want
to
keep
it
by
all
the
laws
of
human
nature
the
thing
ought
to
work
that
way
i
do
know
you
never
know
how
max
is
going
to
take
things
if
you
offered
a
good
price
he
might
jump
at
it
i
would
offer
a
good
price
that
is
not
the
price
i
would
give
if
i
were
very
anxious
to
get
it
sally
thought
it
over
i
do
know
she
said
again
you
told
me
you
were
thinking
of
offering
to
rent
a
few
acres
of
us
and
try
some
market
gardening
i
have
thought
of
that
if
i
could
only
get
leader
of
the
opposition
interested
to
go
in
with
me
your
case
would
be
won
you
never
can
he
have
to
see
somebody
making
a
success
of
it
before
he
will
think
of
it
for
a
minute
there
nothing
anybody
can
do
before
spring
i
suppose
there
considerable
to
be
done
in
winter
i
understand
and
the
spring
work
begins
so
early
it
practically
winter
then
you
ca
think
how
i
want
to
stay
here
this
winter
sighed
sally
you
really
mean
it
and
isolation
empty
rooms
and
cold
winds
and
all
the
ferrys
do
think
it
isolated
when
they
came
they
expected
to
go
back
to
rooms
in
town
for
the
winter
but
they
fallen
so
in
love
with
their
cottage
they
going
to
stay
this
is
the
country
it
only
the
suburbs
eight
minutes
walk
from
the
electrics
true
enough
it
depends
upon
one
point
of
view
does
it
there
a
lot
of
fun
made
of
the
commuters
but
they
not
by
any
means
to
be
placed
all
in
the
same
class
to
people
who
genuinely
love
the
country
it
a
delight
to
get
out
here
no
matter
how
many
minutes
it
takes
to
make
the
run
and
it
really
takes
only
about
minutes
to
get
into
the
heart
of
the
city
so
you
honestly
want
to
stay
here
do
you
sally
lunn
from
this
hour
i
committed
to
the
task
of
trying
to
bring
that
thing
about
jarvis
that
lovely
of
you
you
did
bring
about
my
getting
out
here
in
the
tent
yes
i
heard
the
whole
story
from
jo
i
know
what
a
strategist
you
were
you
such
a
good
friend
to
take
so
much
trouble
am
i
there
nobody
i
rather
take
trouble
for
you
know
that
do
you
if
there
were
more
than
friendship
in
his
eyes
and
voice
sally
did
not
perceive
it
she
was
so
accustomed
to
kindness
and
consideration
from
this
young
man
who
had
grown
up
only
a
few
years
ahead
of
her
and
who
had
been
her
champion
so
long
that
she
had
never
thought
of
him
in
any
other
light
that
no
such
declaration
of
his
friendly
feeling
for
her
was
likely
to
impress
her
as
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
the
eyes
behind
the
blue
goggles
were
hidden
from
her
the
voice
to
her
ear
had
merely
its
usual
warm
ring
of
comradeship
and
she
did
not
note
the
fact
that
upon
the
smooth
dark
cheek
a
touch
of
unwonted
colour
spoke
of
feeling
deeper
than
that
hinted
at
in
the
simple
words
i
know
you
my
and
you
know
i
appreciate
it
if
you
can
possibly
bring
such
a
thing
about
i
bless
you
forever
now
help
me
find
some
books
that
will
entertain
jo
and
your
mother
for
i
must
go
down
to
them
he
pointed
out
a
number
of
quaint
volumes
whose
contents
he
thought
might
prove
interesting
and
she
selected
several
with
which
she
departed
taking
a
gay
farewell
of
him
and
adjuring
him
not
to
use
his
eyes
thank
you
i
use
my
brains
instead
he
answered
it
will
take
all
you
got
she
called
back
i
wonder
if
hearts
are
any
help
in
solving
problems
jarvis
thought
to
himself
when
she
had
gone
hers
certainly
concerned
with
anybody
at
present
but
i
wonder
if
i
a
wise
fellow
to
be
plotting
to
help
her
spend
the
winter
next
door
to
the
finest
chap
i
know
i
wonder
but
i
certainly
committed
to
the
endeavour
whatever
was
the
result
of
his
use
of
the
brains
with
which
he
had
been
endowed
he
lost
no
time
in
making
his
first
effort
that
evening
as
the
company
finished
their
dinner
and
strolled
back
into
the
hall
jarvis
challenged
max
to
a
walk
up
the
cartpath
toward
the
timber
tract
too
wet
objected
max
the
rain
stopped
only
an
hour
ago
everything
soaking
i
know
it
but
we
both
been
shut
up
all
day
and
need
the
exercise
besides
while
we
were
at
dinner
i
saw
ferry
making
for
the
woods
with
his
axe
over
his
shoulder
we
find
him
there
and
have
a
jolly
visit
he
great
company
when
he
at
work
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
for
better
company
at
any
time
i
do
know
of
max
reluctantly
submitted
turned
up
his
trousers
widely
shouldered
an
umbrella
and
the
two
set
out
sally
looked
after
them
her
hopes
following
them
for
she
had
received
a
meaning
look
from
jarvis
which
told
her
that
his
schemes
were
already
on
foot
she
had
seen
him
in
conference
with
his
mother
that
afternoon
and
was
sure
the
two
were
agreed
upon
whatever
suggestion
of
purchase
jarvis
might
be
about
to
make
yet
sally
held
her
breath
what
if
what
if
max
should
after
all
jump
at
the
offer
chapter
ix
max
compromises
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
maxwell
lane
i
compromise
if
sally
and
the
rest
of
you
will
let
up
on
your
nonsensical
plan
of
staying
in
this
barracks
all
winter
i
agree
to
stick
it
out
till
november
he
encountered
sally
gaze
they
were
all
upon
the
great
porch
which
gave
to
the
front
of
the
house
its
impressive
air
of
being
an
old
family
mansion
it
was
a
fortnight
after
the
tent
party
a
fine
august
evening
josephine
and
jarvis
burnside
had
just
driven
out
and
donald
ferry
seeing
them
come
had
strolled
over
so
not
only
sally
but
six
other
people
were
hanging
on
max
decision
he
had
meant
to
say
till
october
but
as
he
met
his
sister
eyes
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
compromise
which
offered
one
month
instead
of
six
might
perhaps
be
considered
a
trifle
too
to
be
accepted
as
a
compromise
at
all
so
he
finished
the
sentence
after
a
perceptible
pause
with
till
november
that
surely
was
being
generous
he
considered
just
why
all
decisions
should
be
made
by
him
as
supreme
arbiter
can
hardly
be
explained
except
that
he
had
assumed
that
position
three
years
before
when
the
other
young
lanes
had
been
negligible
factors
in
all
matters
of
business
and
he
by
the
divine
right
of
his
years
had
upon
the
death
of
his
father
taken
the
management
of
the
family
affairs
into
his
own
hands
sally
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
anyhow
she
now
had
more
than
two
months
reprieve
by
the
end
of
that
period
something
might
happen
to
make
max
willing
to
extend
it
the
tent
had
been
put
up
again
and
all
but
max
had
returned
to
sleeping
in
it
he
had
announced
that
he
cared
to
take
no
more
chances
with
thunderstorms
and
cyclones
so
sally
had
arranged
comfortable
quarters
for
him
in
the
house
in
one
of
the
smaller
downstairs
rooms
looking
out
upon
the
grove
there
was
a
fireplace
in
this
room
and
bob
had
placed
a
beside
it
so
that
his
brother
might
have
no
excuse
for
feeling
himself
neglected
your
compromise
gives
you
so
much
the
bigger
half
of
the
bargain
said
josephine
her
brilliant
dark
eyes
fixed
on
max
that
i
think
you
ought
to
give
sally
something
to
boot
is
that
the
word
what
does
she
want
the
house
furnished
for
the
two
months
much
simpler
than
that
sally
and
i
want
to
have
our
friends
out
for
a
frolic
in
an
empty
house
yes
what
jollier
place
for
a
lot
of
fun
only
it
would
seem
empty
by
the
time
we
had
put
up
a
lot
of
flags
and
bunting
and
goldenrod
and
balsam
branches
that
long
of
yours
with
crash
on
the
floor
and
a
harp
and
violins
behind
a
screen
and
chinese
lanterns
all
over
the
rooms
and
on
the
porch
and
down
the
driveway
josephine
imagination
worked
fast
she
had
gone
into
a
dozen
specifications
before
max
could
get
a
chance
to
interpose
very
fine
very
fine
and
a
loaded
with
salads
and
ices
glorious
idea
how
much
do
you
think
all
this
would
cost
of
course
that
of
no
consequence
but
just
out
of
curiosity
i
should
like
to
know
goodness
we
boxes
of
lanterns
rolls
of
bunting
and
flags
and
yards
of
crash
left
from
parties
way
back
to
my
first
birthday
ones
josephine
assured
him
as
for
the
supper
she
paused
to
think
it
out
for
party
suppers
are
unquestionably
expensive
details
wait
till
october
and
make
it
a
suggested
donald
ferry
he
had
become
in
these
few
weeks
as
much
a
member
of
this
circle
of
friends
as
if
he
had
always
belonged
to
it
then
you
need
only
coffee
and
doughnuts
and
apples
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
be
corn
enough
in
my
patch
to
trim
your
rooms
and
plenty
for
the
husking
jolly
exploded
bob
fine
cried
alec
sally
eyes
were
radiant
even
uncle
timothy
smiled
max
himself
being
after
all
in
spite
of
his
grave
air
only
and
capable
of
enjoying
gay
times
like
the
rest
of
them
felt
his
indifference
melt
away
that
would
give
us
a
chance
to
do
something
in
return
for
all
the
invitations
we
had
ever
since
we
been
in
the
apartment
urged
sally
would
you
like
to
ask
your
friends
in
the
bank
max
if
we
had
the
thing
i
should
mind
asking
two
of
the
fellows
harper
and
ward
max
admitted
oh
i
suppose
we
have
it
when
jo
and
sally
get
their
minds
on
anything
it
has
to
go
through
if
you
can
figure
it
out
so
it
does
mean
a
big
bill
it
may
do
very
well
as
a
to
this
business
this
was
being
condescending
for
max
and
jarvis
smiled
to
himself
as
he
reflected
that
there
nothing
like
having
your
own
way
in
big
matters
to
make
you
decently
amiable
as
regards
small
ones
from
this
evening
the
arrangements
for
the
october
occupied
a
more
or
less
prominent
part
in
the
plans
of
the
lanes
and
their
friends
meanwhile
everybody
including
max
himself
although
he
could
seldom
be
made
to
admit
it
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
intervening
weeks
did
you
ever
see
finer
corn
than
this
asked
ferry
as
he
and
bob
set
up
a
great
shock
of
rustling
stalks
at
one
end
of
the
to
be
sure
i
did
plant
it
i
owe
the
owner
of
the
place
for
that
but
i
hoed
it
and
i
cut
it
and
i
reaping
the
credit
it
magnificent
mr
ferry
sally
agreed
readily
from
the
floor
where
she
sat
fitting
candles
into
chinese
lanterns
of
every
form
and
hue
from
small
round
ones
to
gorgeous
great
affairs
of
fantastic
shape
and
design
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
the
entire
force
was
busy
on
the
front
porch
max
and
josephine
were
hanging
lanterns
while
alec
was
stringing
wires
among
the
trees
and
down
the
driveway
it
was
extraordinary
how
many
lanterns
the
burnsides
seemed
to
have
stored
away
and
in
what
fresh
condition
they
were
the
bunting
and
the
flags
also
although
some
of
this
material
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
use
bales
more
of
it
had
had
to
be
hastily
rumpled
by
josephine
to
get
it
into
the
proper
condition
for
lending
i
tell
you
where
i
put
in
my
fine
touches
chuckled
bob
those
twenty
of
mine
have
teeth
every
one
of
maybe
you
do
think
that
was
some
work
not
only
was
it
work
but
it
shows
a
trained
sense
of
artistic
effect
ferry
assured
him
that
monster
you
put
on
the
porch
with
four
faces
pointing
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
has
janus
the
god
of
beginnings
beaten
to
a
finish
sally
josephine
called
in
at
one
of
the
front
windows
i
forgotten
to
tell
you
who
are
in
town
neil
and
dorothy
chase
they
just
came
last
night
do
you
want
to
ask
them
out
alec
down
the
driveway
heard
and
was
first
to
shout
his
approbation
of
this
idea
get
here
and
ask
if
they
think
there
room
enough
to
turn
round
in
max
from
the
top
of
the
added
his
approval
have
them
whatever
you
do
sally
of
all
the
chumps
bob
whistled
neil
was
afraid
he
burst
our
rooms
in
town
he
recalled
he
can
get
as
chesty
as
he
likes
out
here
you
have
him
wo
you
sally
sally
looked
up
at
their
neighbour
who
was
laughing
quietly
at
the
comments
you
must
think
we
have
odd
motives
for
our
invitations
i
think
the
house
is
going
to
give
the
impression
of
being
a
hospitable
mansion
he
returned
it
will
be
just
the
time
to
invite
anybody
who
likes
space
and
effect
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
this
when
all
was
done
even
before
the
lanterns
and
the
fires
were
lighted
the
the
hall
and
the
all
had
taken
on
such
a
festal
air
that
it
could
occur
to
nobody
to
miss
the
furniture
which
ordinarily
occupies
houses
of
this
character
across
the
hall
two
rooms
had
been
arranged
for
and
even
these
were
highly
attractive
after
the
lanterns
were
lighted
outside
was
fairyland
inside
with
the
fireplaces
burning
huge
logs
and
flashing
intermittently
over
the
scene
the
grinning
cheerfully
from
every
corner
the
flags
and
bunting
contributing
colour
and
the
masses
of
evergreen
and
clumps
of
adding
nooks
and
corners
for
shadows
to
dance
in
there
certainly
could
have
been
no
quainter
or
prettier
background
for
a
party
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
lady
of
the
manor
feels
her
part
she
certainly
looks
it
it
was
jarvis
greeting
as
he
came
up
the
steps
into
the
big
porch
after
a
hasty
trip
home
to
dress
just
as
he
approached
the
house
a
figure
in
white
had
come
out
of
the
doorway
and
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
caught
sally
alone
for
the
first
time
in
several
days
sally
met
him
with
an
eager
welcome
oh
i
so
glad
you
got
back
before
the
rest
came
i
wanted
you
here
to
help
make
things
go
from
the
beginning
max
is
having
fits
with
his
tie
and
alec
is
in
distress
because
his
pumps
do
look
as
smart
as
he
thinks
they
ought
even
bob
is
more
than
usually
fussy
about
the
parting
of
his
hair
too
bad
but
such
small
anxieties
always
go
along
with
dress
occasions
you
do
answer
my
question
do
you
feel
like
the
mistress
of
an
ancestral
home
do
i
i
should
say
i
did
i
feel
like
a
small
girl
giving
her
first
party
i
had
a
thing
to
wear
but
this
old
white
frock
it
lucky
for
me
our
lights
are
the
sort
they
are
electrics
would
show
me
up
for
what
i
am
do
you
know
what
you
are
hardly
what
am
i
do
you
think
a
healthy
happy
sensible
girl
who
does
care
if
she
is
wearing
a
fussy
frock
from
the
most
expensive
place
in
town
and
if
you
were
you
could
look
nicer
thank
you
that
a
straight
masculine
compliment
and
i
appreciate
it
how
good
it
seems
to
see
you
without
those
blue
glasses
are
you
going
to
leave
them
off
i
certainly
am
i
do
care
to
contribute
to
the
weird
effects
among
the
i
want
to
see
everything
as
it
is
including
sally
lane
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
with
the
frank
friendliness
which
never
dreamed
of
turning
these
pleasant
speeches
into
meaning
ones
she
was
heartily
pleased
to
see
him
without
the
disfiguring
glasses
for
the
brown
eyes
were
fine
ones
and
the
face
was
full
of
character
as
well
as
comeliness
no
girl
ever
had
such
good
friends
as
sally
lunn
she
said
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
no
decorations
of
your
house
in
town
ever
called
for
so
much
bunting
and
crash
and
so
many
flags
and
lanterns
as
we
have
here
the
others
have
thought
of
it
but
i
done
a
bit
of
estimating
if
you
please
jarvis
laughed
it
hard
to
get
round
you
but
you
do
mind
mother
and
jo
are
certainly
near
enough
to
being
mother
and
sister
to
you
to
be
allowed
a
bit
of
fun
like
this
you
are
sure
brother
jarvis
did
have
a
hand
it
was
on
his
lips
to
tell
her
that
whatever
relation
he
might
hold
to
her
that
of
brother
would
do
but
he
restrained
the
words
not
yet
it
would
be
a
pity
to
risk
anything
yet
certainly
not
now
when
her
mind
was
full
of
the
coming
party
beside
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
a
word
might
not
spoil
all
his
chances
sally
in
spite
of
her
twenty
years
was
in
some
ways
still
such
a
girl
so
he
only
answered
gayly
both
hands
if
you
do
mind
it
took
hands
shoulders
and
back
to
get
the
stuff
down
from
our
attic
donald
ferry
and
his
mother
now
came
up
the
steps
and
jarvis
and
sally
turned
to
greet
them
ferry
had
given
them
both
a
quick
look
of
keen
scrutiny
as
he
saw
them
standing
there
alone
together
under
the
lanterns
for
some
time
he
had
been
observing
that
the
two
seemed
to
be
close
friends
what
he
thought
however
could
not
have
been
told
from
his
manner
for
he
had
never
seemed
in
a
blither
mood
as
he
shook
hands
and
presented
himself
to
sally
in
the
capacity
of
one
of
her
men
thank
you
she
answered
looking
at
him
precisely
as
she
had
looked
at
jarvis
with
the
girlish
fearlessness
and
absence
of
coquetry
which
is
so
charming
at
her
age
much
as
a
younger
brother
sometimes
looks
at
an
elder
one
whom
he
sincerely
likes
and
admires
i
just
been
telling
jarvis
that
no
girl
ever
had
nicer
friends
you
all
worked
like
slaves
and
i
do
hope
you
have
good
times
enough
to
half
pay
you
jarvis
please
present
mr
ferry
to
the
prettiest
jolliest
girls
we
know
wo
you
and
do
forget
to
take
advantage
of
your
chance
to
dance
with
the
nicest
ones
yourself
she
added
laughing
and
leading
the
way
into
the
house
with
mrs
ferry
who
with
burnside
was
to
chaperon
the
party
both
jarvis
and
ferry
eyes
followed
the
graceful
young
figure
as
it
made
its
way
with
the
elder
one
down
the
hall
among
the
lights
then
for
some
reason
they
turned
to
look
at
each
other
and
smiled
are
you
prepared
to
do
your
duty
by
those
prettiest
and
jolliest
girls
inquired
ferry
if
you
are
it
the
surest
way
of
pleasing
sally
replied
jarvis
with
conviction
sally
characterization
of
the
girls
who
were
her
guests
was
undoubtedly
a
true
one
they
were
attractive
young
people
indeed
who
shortly
came
trooping
up
the
steps
in
gauzy
gowns
of
all
hues
youth
and
happiness
are
always
good
to
look
upon
and
freshness
of
skin
and
brightness
of
eye
make
features
not
strictly
beautiful
charming
in
their
own
way
there
were
plenty
of
young
men
and
youths
max
companion
were
among
them
fellows
whom
the
lanes
liked
upon
sight
and
were
glad
to
entertain
both
for
max
sake
and
their
own
alec
and
bob
had
not
been
denied
the
privilege
of
inviting
certain
youthful
intimates
so
it
was
a
somewhat
diversified
company
in
point
of
age
which
laughed
and
danced
and
talked
and
sang
under
the
lanterns
for
sing
they
did
now
and
then
when
tempted
by
some
popular
air
from
the
little
orchestra
which
somehow
had
been
enlarged
to
include
several
other
instruments
besides
harp
and
violin
josephine
arguing
that
there
must
be
sound
enough
to
be
heard
upon
the
porch
and
lawn
it
was
a
gay
company
and
the
fun
was
at
its
height
when
the
last
guests
to
arrive
drove
up
with
a
proclaiming
flourish
of
a
musical
horn
it
the
chases
we
must
go
out
and
meet
them
max
and
sally
caught
at
her
brother
as
he
was
hastening
by
they
reached
the
porch
as
neil
and
dorothy
descended
from
their
car
and
looked
about
them
well
of
all
the
surprises
was
young
chase
greeting
as
she
swept
across
the
porch
in
a
paris
gown
which
fairly
took
one
breath
away
as
it
was
disclosed
by
the
falling
open
of
a
gorgeous
evening
wrap
jarvis
burnside
looking
out
of
a
porch
window
at
the
moment
as
he
fanned
one
of
the
prettiest
and
jolliest
girls
after
a
brisk
noted
the
contrast
between
dorothy
and
sally
chase
was
as
he
happened
to
know
but
she
looked
considerably
older
and
one
would
have
said
there
were
at
least
eight
years
between
them
yet
sally
although
she
seemed
so
girlish
had
the
hostess
pretty
air
of
which
is
equal
to
greeting
any
number
of
parisian
gowns
and
their
wearers
yes
we
hoped
you
would
enjoy
seeing
us
again
with
room
enough
to
shake
hands
in
and
sally
made
them
welcome
with
a
hearty
greeting
apiece
this
you
sally
asked
neil
chase
surveying
her
with
interest
you
look
more
like
sixteen
than
ever
going
to
put
your
hair
up
when
you
get
to
be
thirty
or
forty
my
hair
is
as
much
up
as
it
can
be
in
the
circumstances
retorted
sally
gayly
unless
i
wear
a
wig
the
best
i
can
do
is
to
tie
it
this
way
with
a
bow
that
so
we
did
hear
you
had
a
fever
in
the
spring
you
do
look
much
like
it
now
more
like
an
infant
cherub
well
max
this
the
old
place
you
had
left
you
my
congratulations
it
not
half
bad
you
know
at
least
as
it
looked
coming
up
the
drive
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
you
must
hug
yourselves
to
get
out
of
that
flat
if
this
a
good
way
out
in
the
country
country
places
are
getting
to
be
the
thing
these
days
anybody
here
we
know
or
is
it
a
neighbourhood
blowout
max
stiffened
as
he
usually
did
by
the
time
neil
chase
had
got
out
a
few
of
his
patronizing
sentences
i
think
you
find
the
same
set
here
you
find
in
town
he
answered
we
have
asked
a
crowd
just
enough
to
be
comfortable
and
have
plenty
of
room
but
we
have
some
of
our
neighbours
here
and
jolly
people
they
are
too
sally
i
ca
possibly
husk
any
corn
chase
murmured
as
sally
led
her
into
the
this
gauze
is
a
fright
now
and
i
worn
it
only
three
times
it
awfully
expensive
but
it
the
thing
now
you
know
so
one
must
have
it
her
eyes
fell
on
sally
dress
as
she
spoke
sally
lane
she
into
sally
ear
as
at
the
moment
the
orchestra
burst
into
a
swinging
waltz
if
that
is
the
very
same
embroidered
swiss
that
you
had
for
my
wedding
almost
four
years
ago
when
you
were
a
mere
child
absolutely
the
same
does
it
wear
well
sally
answered
serenely
much
better
than
gauze
no
you
need
husk
any
corn
that
just
for
those
who
want
a
little
fun
for
a
few
minutes
by
and
by
mr
ferry
as
that
young
man
passed
with
an
inquiring
look
at
her
which
meant
do
you
want
me
for
anything
in
connection
with
these
new
arrivals
and
ferry
was
at
her
side
she
enjoyed
presenting
him
to
the
chases
for
she
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
she
had
noted
a
new
side
of
their
neighbour
thus
far
their
acquaintance
had
been
carried
on
in
tents
and
in
an
environment
so
to
speak
donald
ferry
as
a
good
comrade
she
had
come
to
know
well
donald
ferry
as
a
popular
preacher
she
knew
by
many
an
enthusiastic
report
from
jarvis
alec
and
bob
but
the
same
person
as
a
society
man
in
evening
dress
with
most
engaging
manners
was
a
new
acquaintance
she
observed
him
with
interest
as
he
made
himself
entertaining
to
neil
and
dorothy
and
blessed
him
for
his
tact
when
he
presently
went
off
with
chase
to
do
her
special
honour
as
the
only
young
matron
present
she
observed
that
dorothy
seemed
very
ready
to
accompany
him
neil
looked
after
his
wife
and
her
companion
with
an
expression
of
curiosity
i
like
to
know
how
you
came
to
have
him
here
he
suggested
is
he
that
chap
the
papers
are
full
of
who
holds
forth
to
a
crowd
of
men
every
day
down
in
the
old
dutch
church
he
the
one
max
replied
i
have
heard
him
yet
though
i
mean
to
soon
burnside
and
the
boys
say
he
great
he
lives
next
door
to
us
here
he
not
at
all
the
sort
i
expected
to
see
from
the
stories
about
him
still
the
sanctimonious
sort
probably
could
hold
the
class
of
men
they
say
go
there
regularly
he
lives
next
door
to
you
here
does
he
that
odd
my
brother
ches
did
talk
about
anything
else
than
ferry
this
morning
at
breakfast
says
he
refused
a
flattering
invitation
to
a
church
in
washington
because
he
preferred
to
stay
by
the
old
dutch
well
dorothy
did
realize
he
was
a
parson
or
she
would
have
gone
off
with
him
with
such
a
flourish
if
she
finds
it
out
you
can
look
to
see
her
begin
to
be
demure
i
say
you
certainly
got
a
stunning
old
place
here
think
so
chase
gazed
about
him
at
the
details
of
the
long
noting
its
and
general
proportions
i
rather
like
to
look
it
over
he
proposed
mind
taking
me
about
no
only
it
not
furnished
nor
lighted
except
down
here
where
entertaining
no
electricity
or
gas
i
suppose
out
here
well
you
can
raise
some
kind
of
a
light
to
trot
round
by
ca
you
i
a
crank
on
ancient
houses
and
furniture
wish
you
had
some
old
mahogany
that
what
you
need
in
these
rooms
max
procured
a
small
from
the
kitchen
and
proceeded
to
escort
his
guest
about
neil
began
by
showing
a
patronizing
approval
of
details
here
and
there
but
as
the
survey
continued
he
became
less
conversational
and
walked
about
in
silent
inspection
of
everything
floors
walls
windows
and
ceilings
putting
on
a
pair
of
and
assuming
a
hypercritical
expression
in
excess
even
of
his
ordinary
attitude
very
fair
very
fair
was
his
reply
when
max
asked
him
at
the
conclusion
of
the
round
of
the
second
story
how
he
liked
it
determined
to
make
the
most
of
his
chance
to
interest
this
ordinarily
bored
young
man
max
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
to
the
old
library
here
neil
opened
his
eyes
but
as
he
immediately
narrowed
them
again
and
began
to
examine
books
with
an
indifferent
air
max
was
not
sure
how
much
of
an
impression
the
collection
was
making
neil
presently
sat
down
suppose
we
stay
a
few
minutes
quiet
spot
rather
enjoy
getting
away
from
the
crowd
er
not
intending
to
furnish
up
and
stay
here
are
you
quite
a
distance
from
town
is
it
that
the
objection
to
living
out
here
have
you
heard
that
i
coming
back
to
practise
in
the
city
no
that
so
with
your
father
firm
yes
dad
made
me
a
pretty
good
offer
and
while
it
was
considerable
of
a
sacrifice
to
leave
the
business
i
built
up
down
there
i
willing
to
humour
the
old
man
he
crossed
his
legs
in
a
superior
sort
of
way
his
head
thrown
back
after
a
fashion
which
always
made
max
want
to
throw
something
at
him
and
disturb
his
pose
his
tone
was
immensely
condescending
when
do
you
make
the
move
right
away
the
governor
in
a
hurry
and
i
agreed
to
lose
no
time
do
care
to
live
with
the
old
folks
again
so
i
shall
look
round
a
bit
for
a
place
i
drive
a
car
you
know
and
i
rather
taken
a
fancy
to
having
a
country
place
something
on
the
order
i
picked
up
rather
a
decent
collection
of
old
mahogany
and
prints
sheffield
plate
and
lowestoft
china
that
sort
of
thing
that
needs
a
certain
background
to
show
it
off
i
heard
of
a
number
of
places
that
might
suit
me
there
are
a
good
many
abandoned
country
places
these
days
people
like
to
get
into
town
not
many
care
like
me
for
the
artistic
point
of
view
in
such
matters
er
i
suppose
you
sell
this
place
his
tone
was
careless
but
max
who
was
watching
him
closely
saw
a
peculiar
gleam
in
his
eye
which
put
him
on
his
guard
neil
chase
was
nothing
if
not
shrewd
and
sharp
to
the
point
where
the
man
who
dealt
with
him
must
look
closely
after
his
own
interests
oh
i
do
know
max
replied
slowly
have
made
up
my
mind
considering
an
offer
now
for
the
place
some
people
like
to
get
into
town
as
you
say
but
plenty
more
appreciate
life
in
the
country
when
they
can
get
such
a
spot
as
this
values
in
such
property
are
going
up
not
down
in
my
opinion
if
sally
could
have
heard
him
chapter
x
to
the
strains
of
the
intermezzo
from
the
cavalleria
rusticana
which
the
orchestra
was
sending
out
through
the
open
windows
max
was
returning
from
the
gateway
to
the
house
the
october
night
was
so
mild
that
he
had
stolen
out
bareheaded
upon
the
errand
which
had
taken
him
to
the
road
the
errand
might
have
been
considered
an
odd
one
he
wanted
to
look
at
the
house
to
be
sure
illuminated
as
it
was
by
many
gayly
coloured
lights
the
lanterns
glowing
all
across
the
porch
and
down
the
driveway
it
was
well
worth
looking
at
but
it
was
not
this
decorative
effect
which
the
young
host
had
come
out
to
exult
over
and
viewed
as
a
residence
only
he
had
certainly
observed
it
many
times
before
and
under
varying
conditions
he
knew
to
a
nicety
just
how
many
slats
were
lacking
from
certain
of
the
blinds
just
how
the
ragged
edge
of
the
great
chimney
showed
against
the
sky
line
precisely
where
the
big
pillared
porch
needed
repairing
no
it
was
not
in
any
of
these
aspects
that
he
had
come
curiously
out
to
view
it
now
he
wanted
to
see
it
with
the
eyes
of
the
prospective
purchasers
jarvis
burnside
and
neil
chase
he
wanted
particularly
to
see
it
as
chase
saw
it
that
upon
mention
of
the
fact
that
max
had
already
been
interviewed
by
a
prospective
buyer
he
had
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
appear
indifferent
really
shown
such
eagerness
to
be
given
an
option
upon
the
place
max
walked
slowly
back
toward
the
house
under
the
shadow
of
the
row
of
great
trees
bordering
what
had
once
been
a
lawn
two
figures
had
just
come
out
upon
the
porch
he
recognized
them
even
at
this
distance
as
the
chases
at
the
moment
nobody
else
occupied
the
porch
neil
and
dorothy
stood
for
a
moment
under
the
lanterns
looking
back
into
the
hall
then
turned
and
descended
the
steps
they
surveyed
the
house
as
they
did
so
they
backed
farther
away
from
it
they
strolled
round
to
the
west
side
and
viewed
it
from
that
point
finally
as
max
halted
beside
a
watching
them
they
began
to
walk
slowly
down
the
driveway
turning
from
time
to
time
to
gaze
back
at
the
as
they
passed
max
catching
no
hint
of
his
presence
in
the
shadow
they
conversed
in
phrases
which
were
of
interest
to
him
and
to
which
since
they
intimately
concerned
himself
he
might
be
excused
for
listening
it
simply
stunning
dorothy
was
saying
eagerly
as
they
passed
rather
have
it
than
forty
new
houses
when
it
restored
it
will
have
such
an
air
i
do
suppose
they
appreciate
it
at
all
do
they
oh
do
get
hold
of
it
before
anybody
tells
them
max
says
sally
is
crazy
to
live
in
it
but
that
ca
be
because
she
realizes
its
value
no
she
just
child
enough
to
like
it
because
homelike
and
her
uncle
and
grandfather
lived
in
it
not
because
such
a
swell
type
of
the
real
old
thing
that
people
rave
over
now
max
is
the
sort
to
care
for
it
either
but
he
has
an
eye
on
the
cash
i
shall
have
to
put
up
a
fair
price
all
right
to
get
it
i
try
bluffing
first
though
he
too
much
of
an
office
grind
to
care
for
anything
else
so
long
as
he
gets
his
money
i
say
wo
that
gateway
be
a
corker
when
it
put
right
they
walked
on
out
of
hearing
but
max
had
heard
all
that
was
necessary
to
make
him
tingle
oh
it
will
be
a
corker
will
it
he
said
to
himself
as
he
made
for
the
back
of
the
house
by
way
of
the
pine
grove
maybe
it
will
old
man
but
not
when
put
it
right
an
office
grind
am
i
too
dull
to
know
a
good
thing
when
i
own
it
eh
and
you
try
bluffing
will
you
all
right
bluff
away
and
much
good
may
it
do
you
i
sell
it
to
jarve
burnside
before
i
sell
it
to
you
but
i
hello
where
are
you
going
he
had
almost
run
into
jarvis
hastily
emerging
from
the
kitchen
door
with
a
smoking
the
declining
candle
of
which
had
made
of
it
both
a
wreck
and
the
source
of
a
horrible
odour
jarvis
cast
the
pumpkin
to
one
side
and
wiped
his
hands
on
his
handkerchief
just
prevented
a
small
conflagration
of
he
explained
what
are
you
doing
prowling
round
your
own
back
door
making
up
my
mind
not
to
sell
this
place
to
you
or
to
anybody
else
said
max
promptly
speaking
under
the
impulse
of
his
irritation
good
work
i
do
blame
you
i
certainly
do
want
it
you
i
hope
you
wo
go
back
on
letting
me
rent
a
few
acres
though
to
try
my
hand
at
farming
in
the
spring
jarve
max
sat
down
on
the
kitchen
step
do
you
seriously
think
a
fellow
could
make
a
living
off
this
land
taking
into
account
all
the
and
pests
and
and
every
other
thing
that
i
always
understood
makes
the
life
of
the
farmer
miserable
i
think
replied
jarvis
laughing
a
little
at
max
way
of
putting
it
but
awake
to
the
importance
of
discussing
the
matter
seriously
if
max
showed
an
inclination
to
do
so
that
trying
to
do
it
with
the
help
of
all
the
experience
that
modern
experiment
stations
have
placed
at
our
hands
would
be
about
the
most
interesting
thing
possible
you
might
not
want
to
give
up
all
other
business
till
you
had
proved
that
you
really
could
do
it
but
i
certainly
do
think
the
thing
would
be
well
worth
trying
it
being
attempted
more
and
more
these
days
by
educated
men
college
graduates
and
professional
men
of
all
ranks
partly
for
the
pure
interest
of
the
thing
partly
because
the
life
is
about
the
best
worth
living
look
at
don
ferry
for
an
example
could
he
possibly
have
the
hold
he
has
on
that
crowd
of
his
at
the
old
dutch
if
he
were
a
man
made
of
substantial
flesh
and
blood
his
brain
as
healthy
and
his
heart
as
warm
as
exercise
and
oxygen
can
make
them
well
perhaps
he
could
if
he
were
one
of
your
pale
and
scholarly
ghosts
but
i
doubt
it
this
idea
of
living
out
here
in
winter
max
went
off
on
a
new
tack
it
seemed
to
me
absolute
foolishness
but
if
neil
chase
is
so
confoundedly
anxious
to
move
in
before
we
can
move
out
neil
chase
yes
he
practically
made
me
an
offer
for
the
place
well
well
jarvis
eyes
gleamed
with
satisfaction
in
the
darkness
so
old
neil
was
helping
the
thing
along
was
he
nothing
could
have
been
better
going
to
consider
it
hardly
see
here
could
we
keep
warm
in
that
barracks
this
winter
you
do
have
to
live
all
over
it
with
those
fireplaces
and
waste
wood
enough
in
your
lot
up
there
to
run
a
i
do
see
why
you
should
have
any
fear
of
freezing
our
little
stock
of
furniture
would
go
anywhere
in
furnishing
it
would
furnish
a
certain
amount
of
space
keep
the
rest
shut
up
till
you
could
furnish
it
i
should
think
of
the
thing
for
a
minute
said
max
in
the
tone
of
one
who
explains
the
inconsistency
of
so
sudden
a
change
of
attitude
if
i
had
this
day
been
notified
that
the
price
of
our
flat
is
to
go
up
ten
dollars
a
month
on
the
first
of
november
it
an
outrage
it
an
extraordinary
piece
of
luck
said
jarvis
to
himself
but
aloud
he
admitted
that
it
was
a
good
deal
of
a
jump
and
a
pretty
high
price
for
the
flat
at
this
moment
some
one
looked
out
of
the
kitchen
window
and
then
asked
mary
ann
inside
if
she
had
seen
anything
lately
of
max
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
crowd
admitted
max
and
they
returned
just
in
time
to
see
the
first
guests
taking
their
leave
when
all
had
gone
jarvis
hunted
up
sally
he
found
her
in
one
of
the
extinguishing
candles
which
had
nearly
burned
to
the
bottoms
of
the
lanterns
and
were
threatening
their
inflammable
surroundings
here
do
touch
those
things
with
your
thin
clothes
on
jarvis
cried
we
fellows
must
go
round
and
make
all
safe
no
taking
any
chances
with
the
house
full
of
dry
but
first
have
you
had
a
good
time
a
glorious
time
all
the
evening
i
felt
as
if
i
lived
here
it
looked
so
furnished
somehow
with
all
the
lights
and
decorations
it
made
you
want
to
live
here
more
than
ever
did
it
it
did
indeed
and
in
ten
days
we
shall
be
going
back
to
town
perhaps
you
wo
she
stared
at
him
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
i
do
mean
anything
said
he
laughing
i
like
a
small
boy
bursting
with
the
secret
information
that
there
to
be
for
dinner
so
i
do
mean
anything
but
i
like
to
shake
hands
on
it
just
the
same
jarvis
she
let
him
seize
both
her
hands
and
shake
them
up
and
down
you
do
mean
something
come
out
in
the
hall
and
do
the
prance
with
me
the
prance
what
in
the
world
is
that
are
you
crazy
i
teach
it
to
you
and
he
led
her
out
into
the
wide
hall
which
had
been
all
the
evening
the
most
attractive
spot
in
the
house
he
pulled
two
stalks
from
one
of
the
sheaves
which
stood
on
each
side
of
the
great
fireplace
he
handed
her
one
and
throwing
the
other
across
his
shoulder
as
if
it
were
a
gun
marched
to
the
door
the
musicians
were
just
putting
away
their
instruments
having
played
till
the
last
guests
were
out
of
hearing
just
one
more
will
you
he
asked
grinning
at
them
in
a
way
which
they
understood
meant
an
extra
fee
then
he
came
back
to
sally
now
for
it
he
said
i
never
did
this
myself
nor
heard
of
it
but
if
we
ca
do
an
impromptu
turn
on
our
high
spirits
we
never
can
again
come
on
as
the
music
burst
forth
and
he
made
her
an
impressive
bow
smiling
and
ready
enough
to
follow
his
lead
sally
returned
him
a
sweeping
courtesy
in
minuet
style
hi
what
this
cried
bob
returning
from
the
porch
where
he
with
the
others
had
been
watching
the
departure
of
the
procession
of
carriages
and
automobiles
which
had
borne
the
guests
away
here
come
and
see
what
going
on
he
shouted
back
to
the
porch
and
they
came
hurrying
in
burnside
and
donald
ferry
josephine
and
max
mrs
ferry
and
alec
and
uncle
timothy
ranged
themselves
along
the
walls
their
faces
all
enjoyment
of
the
somewhat
remarkable
affair
now
in
progress
jarvis
and
sally
might
have
been
improvising
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
were
but
the
result
was
the
product
of
inspiration
up
and
down
double
and
single
in
and
out
round
and
round
with
all
manner
of
fancy
steps
both
surprising
and
picturesque
saluting
each
other
every
now
and
then
with
bows
with
wavings
of
the
with
gestures
of
greeting
and
farewell
jarvis
without
his
glasses
his
face
brilliant
with
life
and
merriment
looked
a
different
fellow
from
the
one
his
friends
had
been
accustomed
to
see
of
late
and
sally
her
cheeks
like
crimson
carnations
her
eyes
dark
with
fun
and
happiness
her
steps
the
embodiment
of
youthful
grace
was
a
fascinating
figure
to
watch
is
that
the
prettiest
thing
you
ever
saw
asked
josephine
of
donald
ferry
as
he
stood
beside
her
with
folded
arms
he
nodded
i
suppose
they
making
it
up
as
they
go
along
he
said
but
very
clever
and
charming
i
did
know
your
brother
had
it
in
him
to
be
so
gay
oh
he
has
it
this
long
bother
with
his
eyes
that
has
made
him
look
like
an
owl
and
feel
like
one
he
has
plenty
of
fun
and
energy
in
him
when
it
gets
a
chance
i
beginning
to
find
him
out
i
like
a
chap
who
can
relax
like
that
and
show
the
boyish
side
of
himself
now
and
then
and
is
sally
perfectly
dear
i
never
saw
her
look
prettier
than
declared
josephine
with
an
unconscious
glance
from
white
frock
which
she
knew
was
an
old
and
much
mended
one
down
at
her
own
pale
blue
gown
just
home
from
an
expensive
shop
she
was
thinking
that
if
she
looked
half
as
well
in
her
fine
things
as
sally
in
her
simple
old
ones
she
should
be
quite
content
ferry
looked
down
at
the
dark
head
beside
him
he
remembered
no
less
than
three
fair
maids
who
had
that
evening
called
his
attention
by
one
means
and
another
to
points
less
attractive
than
their
own
in
other
girls
it
struck
him
as
it
had
done
more
than
once
before
that
a
very
warm
generosity
characterized
the
friendship
between
josephine
and
sally
inasmuch
as
each
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
most
anxious
to
have
him
appreciate
the
charms
of
the
other
as
for
josephine
herself
though
he
would
not
bluntly
tell
her
so
she
had
seldom
presented
a
more
winsome
picture
than
her
dark
colouring
and
piquant
features
possessed
a
quality
very
close
to
beauty
and
her
smile
at
sally
at
a
moment
when
the
girl
sweeping
close
made
her
friend
a
special
salutation
was
undoubtedly
a
very
attractive
thing
a
burst
of
enthusiastic
applause
greeted
the
final
whirl
and
bows
of
the
prance
and
sally
breathless
dropped
upon
the
bottom
step
of
the
wide
staircase
jarvis
coming
close
to
max
whose
was
of
the
heartiest
said
in
his
friend
ear
why
not
tell
her
now
that
you
decided
to
stay
here
if
you
do
you
make
this
the
happiest
night
of
her
life
max
looked
at
him
sally
elder
brother
was
in
a
more
genial
mood
than
he
had
been
in
for
some
time
somehow
his
new
understanding
that
the
lanes
possessed
a
more
valuable
piece
of
property
than
they
had
realized
property
for
which
two
buyers
were
ready
at
any
hour
to
give
them
a
satisfactory
price
had
put
him
into
good
humour
then
he
had
been
all
the
evening
playing
the
pleasant
part
of
host
under
conditions
which
had
called
forth
many
complimentary
remarks
from
guests
whose
opinions
he
valued
and
he
was
experiencing
the
comfortable
glow
which
comes
with
such
a
role
just
now
the
sight
of
his
little
sister
making
of
herself
so
charming
a
spectacle
had
caused
him
to
feel
an
unusual
stirring
of
pride
in
her
all
these
factors
combined
to
help
jarvis
suggestion
he
approached
his
sister
as
she
sat
rosy
cheeked
and
laughing
on
the
lowest
stair
and
stood
before
her
that
was
so
bad
he
said
approvingly
you
and
jarve
had
better
get
out
a
copyright
on
that
you
worked
in
some
pretty
fancy
steps
got
your
skates
on
have
you
sally
thrust
forward
a
small
foot
no
only
some
badly
pumps
if
it
had
been
for
bob
and
his
they
would
never
have
been
presentable
again
you
certainly
great
on
making
things
go
er
that
is
suppose
you
could
make
six
chairs
a
table
and
an
old
couch
furnish
that
room
in
there
for
the
winter
their
eyes
met
those
who
happened
to
be
observing
from
a
little
distance
and
of
these
there
were
at
least
three
who
had
as
yet
been
unable
to
take
their
eyes
off
sally
saw
such
a
wave
of
delight
sweep
over
her
expressive
face
as
made
it
even
more
vivid
than
they
had
ever
seen
it
after
an
instant
silence
her
lips
parted
the
girl
was
on
her
feet
max
do
you
mean
it
are
we
to
stay
oh
you
old
dear
make
our
things
furnish
that
room
of
course
i
can
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
for
the
space
of
two
seconds
then
she
had
seized
his
hand
and
was
pulling
him
toward
the
others
jarvis
watching
max
face
saw
there
more
amiability
than
he
could
have
hoped
yet
it
would
have
been
a
strangely
flinty
heart
he
thought
that
could
have
resisted
sally
ladies
and
gentlemen
sally
made
them
a
low
bow
we
are
so
glad
you
enjoyed
our
hospitality
allow
us
to
express
our
hope
that
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
you
often
during
the
winter
we
shall
be
at
home
here
every
saturday
evening
throughout
the
season
refreshments
and
music
with
conversation
bob
was
first
to
respond
with
a
shout
he
dashed
into
the
long
from
which
the
musicians
had
now
departed
and
relieved
his
feelings
by
turning
a
series
of
handsprings
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
alec
who
had
not
much
cared
to
spend
the
winter
in
the
country
but
had
of
late
become
immensely
drawn
toward
donald
ferry
reflected
that
there
might
be
good
times
forthcoming
out
here
which
would
never
happen
in
town
so
he
grinned
pleasantly
enough
uncle
timothy
beaming
said
that
very
good
to
burnside
and
she
returned
warmly
indeed
i
think
it
is
mr
rudd
josephine
clapped
both
her
hands
then
ran
to
wring
sally
and
max
declaring
joyfully
you
be
the
most
popular
resort
outside
the
city
jarvis
followed
to
observe
in
a
calm
tone
to
cover
his
delight
though
he
succeeded
in
only
partially
concealing
it
from
max
and
not
at
all
from
sally
i
think
it
a
wise
decision
and
i
hope
it
will
mean
a
partnership
in
strawberries
and
squashes
next
summer
you
see
me
out
soon
with
since
we
did
find
any
behind
that
locked
door
last
april
we
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
such
neighbours
for
the
winter
said
mrs
ferry
with
genuine
pleasure
in
her
face
and
i
hope
donald
and
i
can
do
something
toward
making
you
feel
that
you
have
real
country
neighbours
of
the
kind
who
are
counted
as
assets
if
it
were
for
you
people
i
do
think
i
should
have
the
courage
to
try
it
acknowledged
max
we
make
it
such
a
winter
you
never
have
the
courage
to
go
back
prophesied
ferry
i
have
a
pair
of
toboggans
stowed
away
somewhere
send
for
them
when
the
snow
comes
that
slope
from
your
timber
lot
down
across
the
fields
bob
returning
from
the
handspring
episode
caught
these
words
and
raised
a
whoop
of
anticipation
hi
toboggans
he
was
heard
to
ejaculate
at
intervals
during
the
next
ten
minutes
sally
said
uncle
timothy
rudd
up
in
new
hampshire
where
i
used
to
live
before
i
came
to
stay
with
your
family
there
is
an
attic
full
of
old
furniture
which
belonged
to
my
father
i
have
never
disposed
of
it
because
certain
associations
made
me
have
an
affection
for
it
it
is
pretty
old
style
and
not
i
am
afraid
in
very
good
condition
but
if
you
care
for
it
oh
uncle
timmy
no
matter
how
old
it
is
or
how
shaky
we
can
use
it
probably
the
older
and
shakier
it
is
the
more
valuable
when
it
has
been
restored
suggested
burnside
i
should
say
so
declared
jarvis
with
emphasis
you
should
have
heard
the
neil
chases
rave
over
some
of
theirs
neil
found
a
sideboard
in
an
old
cabin
down
south
it
had
the
doors
nailed
on
with
strips
of
leather
they
kept
corn
meal
and
molasses
in
it
he
would
take
five
hundred
dollars
for
it
now
i
do
imagine
said
uncle
timothy
cautiously
that
any
of
my
things
are
as
valuable
as
that
so
do
get
your
expectations
too
high
sally
but
they
may
help
you
in
the
matter
of
supplying
chairs
and
beds
for
your
friends
i
take
it
this
will
be
a
hospitable
homestead
when
sally
is
mistress
of
it
how
could
it
help
being
hospitable
cried
sally
happily
with
friends
like
ours
for
guests
let
make
a
circle
on
the
hearth
for
good
luck
proposed
josephine
beckoning
she
led
the
way
toward
the
fireplace
where
the
flames
of
the
big
logs
which
had
leaped
and
danced
there
all
the
evening
carefully
fed
by
bob
from
time
to
time
had
now
died
down
into
a
mass
of
brilliant
coals
on
either
side
the
sheaves
of
yellow
stood
like
sentinels
and
above
a
row
of
whose
candles
had
been
renewed
when
they
threatened
to
burn
low
looked
cheerfully
down
from
the
high
all
join
hands
commanded
josephine
and
sing
lang
syne
will
you
let
such
new
acquaintances
join
in
that
song
asked
mrs
ferry
as
alec
who
was
next
her
caught
her
hand
in
obedience
to
orders
of
course
we
will
we
hope
that
time
will
make
you
old
friends
answered
uncle
timothy
gallantly
stretching
out
his
hand
as
he
stood
next
upon
her
other
side
it
is
rather
curious
how
in
any
such
grouping
certain
combinations
come
about
neither
jarvis
burnside
nor
donald
ferry
seemed
to
make
any
abrupt
moves
and
there
certainly
was
a
moment
when
it
might
have
seemed
the
natural
thing
that
jarvis
should
grasp
uncle
timothy
hand
ferry
seize
upon
bob
but
so
it
did
not
turn
out
when
the
circle
began
slowly
to
revolve
before
the
fire
one
of
hands
was
in
jarvis
the
other
in
that
of
the
neighbour
who
could
chop
down
trees
as
easily
as
he
could
address
audiences
and
whose
hand
therefore
possessed
a
warm
and
even
grip
which
suggested
both
friendliness
and
strength
upon
donald
ferry
farther
side
was
josephine
and
max
clasped
her
other
hand
as
for
alec
and
bob
it
did
not
matter
much
to
them
whose
hands
they
held
so
that
the
circle
moved
briskly
and
sang
lustily
and
this
it
surely
did
are
you
happy
little
girl
asked
jarvis
bending
to
speak
into
ear
as
the
circle
broke
up
smiling
sally
dashed
away
a
tear
so
happy
i
almost
crying
she
owned
it
beginning
to
seem
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
a
home
a
real
home
once
more
as
much
as
we
ever
can
without
i
understand
he
whispered
and
led
her
away
down
the
hall
that
she
might
recover
the
poise
the
singing
of
the
old
song
had
shaken
they
must
have
been
here
often
when
we
children
were
little
she
murmured
pausing
by
the
open
door
under
the
staircase
which
led
to
a
side
porch
just
here
she
was
hidden
from
the
rest
i
sure
they
were
i
remember
driving
out
here
once
with
your
father
and
seeing
him
sit
in
front
of
that
hall
fireplace
with
your
uncle
maxwell
talking
business
they
were
here
more
i
imagine
when
you
were
very
small
than
afterward
when
you
were
old
enough
to
remember
they
been
here
said
sally
softly
they
walked
about
these
old
floors
and
looked
out
of
these
windows
that
makes
it
home
to
me
and
if
i
can
only
make
it
home
to
the
others
you
could
help
making
it
home
anywhere
oh
jarvis
you
such
a
good
friend
i
keep
telling
you
that
till
you
must
be
tired
of
hearing
it
i
not
tired
of
hearing
it
there
followed
an
eloquent
little
silence
during
which
jarvis
took
the
girl
hand
in
both
his
own
and
held
it
close
in
a
way
which
meant
to
her
the
comprehending
sympathy
with
all
her
joys
and
sorrows
which
he
had
long
given
her
to
him
it
meant
so
much
more
that
he
dared
not
give
expression
to
it
in
any
but
this
mute
fashion
but
his
heart
beat
high
with
longing
and
with
hope
though
he
was
firmly
bidding
himself
wait
and
wait
a
long
time
yet
before
he
put
his
fortune
to
the
touch
to
win
or
lose
it
all
then
sally
wiped
her
eyes
put
her
handkerchief
away
and
faced
about
now
i
can
go
back
she
said
thank
you
for
giving
me
a
chance
to
put
sally
lunn
in
order
the
mistress
of
a
mansion
like
this
must
always
have
herself
in
hand
must
she
standing
on
her
own
sally
said
to
all
her
guests
like
the
grand
lady
she
gayly
affected
to
be
but
like
the
girl
she
was
she
ran
after
them
to
wave
her
hand
at
them
from
the
big
porch
crying
come
again
please
do
come
again
oh
soon
part
two
the
lanes
and
the
acres
chapter
xi
what
in
a
name
well
here
he
comes
announced
maxwell
lane
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
was
standing
by
a
window
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
gateway
and
approach
to
the
house
he
me
this
morning
he
be
out
loaded
for
bear
i
wager
if
he
has
one
treatise
on
farming
in
that
cutter
he
has
forty
sally
ran
to
look
i
do
see
anything
unusual
said
she
her
eyes
on
the
trim
sleigh
drawn
by
a
pair
of
fine
grays
the
driver
waving
an
arm
at
the
window
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
faces
thereat
expect
to
see
and
threshing
machines
sticking
out
from
under
his
furs
jolly
that
a
magnificent
robe
he
has
over
his
knees
looks
like
a
farmer
does
he
now
think
a
fellow
in
a
overcoat
and
like
those
knows
anything
about
farming
or
ever
can
know
he
added
skeptically
i
do
see
why
not
there
nothing
about
a
overcoat
to
prevent
sally
tone
was
spirited
she
thrust
her
hands
into
the
pockets
of
the
small
ruffled
apron
she
wore
and
her
elbows
assumed
an
argumentative
air
the
black
ribbon
which
tied
her
lengthening
curly
locks
into
a
knot
upon
her
head
seemed
to
acquire
a
defiant
effect
evidently
she
was
prepared
to
take
sides
in
this
matter
if
rich
sons
can
learn
railroading
and
mining
and
every
other
kind
of
business
that
soils
their
hands
i
do
know
what
to
prevent
one
of
them
from
learning
farming
oh
he
get
hold
of
a
tremendous
amount
of
book
wisdom
i
prepared
for
that
admitted
max
but
it
takes
a
practical
man
to
be
a
farmer
he
want
to
use
up
a
lot
of
money
in
experiments
of
course
but
sally
had
disappeared
into
the
hall
and
was
throwing
open
the
front
door
the
sleigh
however
was
going
on
past
the
house
to
the
barn
that
means
he
intends
to
stay
reflected
the
girl
and
ran
back
to
the
kitchen
for
a
few
hurried
words
with
mary
ann
flinders
it
was
not
the
habit
of
the
house
materially
to
change
any
plans
for
the
table
on
account
of
unexpected
arrivals
but
there
were
certain
dishes
jarvis
was
known
to
enjoy
so
much
that
sally
liked
to
confront
him
with
at
least
one
of
them
when
she
could
make
some
of
the
to
go
with
the
baked
beans
please
mary
she
directed
and
be
sure
to
put
in
plenty
of
sugar
so
it
will
get
brown
and
candied
the
way
we
like
it
use
the
baldwin
apples
and
leave
the
red
skins
on
the
slices
that
makes
it
look
prettiest
she
peeped
into
the
small
kitchen
mirror
as
she
went
by
the
mirror
whose
presence
was
designed
to
point
out
to
mary
ann
that
her
rough
red
locks
might
now
and
then
need
smoothing
sally
own
hair
was
the
source
of
considerable
bother
at
present
it
having
reached
that
stage
in
its
growth
since
her
fever
when
it
was
neither
short
nor
long
and
called
for
much
skill
in
arrangement
she
tucked
in
a
stray
curl
or
two
gave
a
perk
to
the
black
bow
stood
on
her
to
make
sure
that
the
silk
knot
which
fastened
her
sailor
collar
was
in
trim
shape
and
felt
of
the
crisp
strings
which
tied
her
decidedly
coquettish
apron
to
ascertain
that
that
bow
was
also
snug
then
she
looked
round
at
mary
ann
and
caught
that
young
person
eyeing
her
slyly
but
with
great
admiration
sally
laughed
and
mary
ann
giggled
then
the
latter
glanced
significantly
out
of
the
kitchen
window
toward
the
barn
whence
a
tall
figure
was
issuing
with
its
arms
full
of
books
and
magazines
i
guess
i
know
miss
sally
ventured
mary
ann
who
was
comin
if
i
did
see
for
myself
an
you
primpin
up
like
that
when
you
do
need
it
at
all
bein
always
tidy
mary
i
surprised
at
you
said
sally
severely
and
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
with
her
head
up
but
she
had
laughed
and
mary
ann
was
not
afraid
ridiculous
said
sally
to
herself
in
the
hall
i
shall
never
look
in
that
kitchen
glass
again
when
anybody
is
here
as
if
i
ever
did
any
special
for
an
old
friend
like
jarvis
girls
like
that
are
always
thinking
silly
things
and
she
walked
on
to
the
hall
door
of
half
a
mind
not
to
open
it
after
all
lest
jarvis
himself
think
his
welcome
too
eager
yet
as
she
always
did
open
it
for
him
or
for
any
other
of
their
special
friends
whom
she
chanced
to
see
approaching
she
promptly
discarded
this
line
of
conduct
as
absurd
and
threw
the
door
wide
with
the
hospitable
sweep
to
which
he
was
so
accustomed
that
he
would
have
been
surprised
and
puzzled
at
its
absence
he
looked
at
her
over
his
armful
of
books
his
face
red
with
the
sting
of
the
sharp
january
air
his
eyes
keen
through
the
astride
his
nose
goggles
were
now
a
thing
of
the
past
but
the
eyeglasses
their
lenses
thick
with
the
combination
of
formulae
which
had
ruled
their
grinding
were
a
permanent
necessity
it
was
the
first
time
sally
had
seen
him
since
he
had
acquired
them
very
becoming
she
said
critically
as
he
put
down
the
books
on
the
hall
table
pulled
off
the
handsome
which
according
to
max
helped
to
disqualify
him
for
his
present
ambitions
and
shook
hands
with
heartiness
you
no
longer
look
pathetic
but
distinguished
even
scientific
is
the
word
if
you
want
to
flatter
me
he
declared
throwing
off
his
overcoat
and
gathering
up
the
books
again
acquiring
agricultural
science
by
the
peck
measure
chock
full
and
running
over
i
reached
the
point
where
i
must
get
rid
of
some
of
it
upon
my
partners
or
suffer
serious
consequences
max
here
was
it
he
at
the
window
i
ca
see
more
than
a
rod
through
these
things
yet
not
used
to
them
yes
he
here
he
always
spends
his
saturday
at
home
now
the
rest
are
away
alec
and
bob
are
off
on
the
hill
by
the
timber
lot
trying
mr
ferry
toboggan
with
him
it
just
come
uncle
tim
has
gone
over
to
see
how
they
making
it
go
glad
the
coast
is
clear
it
might
embarrass
me
to
set
forth
my
schemes
to
more
than
two
at
once
sally
led
the
way
to
the
in
old
times
the
but
now
deserving
the
less
imposing
title
after
a
fashion
which
made
it
the
most
homelike
of
apartments
it
was
the
only
room
on
the
lower
floor
except
the
and
kitchen
which
the
lanes
had
attempted
to
furnish
for
the
winter
so
the
rugs
and
chairs
tables
and
couch
of
the
little
flat
had
been
all
that
was
necessary
to
make
it
habitable
and
pleasant
a
brisk
fire
burned
on
the
wide
hearth
of
itself
a
furnishing
without
which
many
a
sumptuous
room
may
seem
cheerless
and
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
quaint
old
paper
of
white
with
gold
stripes
about
which
green
ivy
leaves
wound
conventionally
this
might
have
given
the
room
a
cold
aspect
but
sally
had
hung
curtains
of
print
at
the
windows
and
had
covered
the
couch
and
its
pillows
with
the
same
fabric
with
a
result
so
pleasing
to
the
eye
that
visitors
at
the
first
sight
were
wont
to
exclaim
who
would
think
you
could
have
made
this
big
room
look
so
homelike
how
have
you
done
it
yards
of
was
sally
customary
demure
answer
and
the
visitor
if
a
woman
was
sure
to
respond
oh
yes
of
course
such
a
lovely
idea
for
winter
if
a
man
he
was
more
apt
merely
to
stare
at
sally
with
real
respect
for
the
feminine
comprehension
of
the
influence
of
a
hue
upon
a
general
effect
not
understanding
the
matter
himself
but
dimly
comprehending
that
the
result
had
been
accomplished
and
the
room
made
to
look
like
a
refuge
from
the
bitterest
storms
which
might
sweep
outside
well
primed
to
the
muzzle
was
max
greeting
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
go
to
the
hall
to
welcome
the
guest
but
had
thrown
himself
among
the
red
pillows
facing
the
fire
the
wide
couch
stood
always
in
comfortable
proximity
to
the
hearth
and
was
a
favourite
resort
for
the
entire
household
not
unadvisedly
had
sally
covered
the
eight
pillows
with
the
strong
red
fabric
it
could
withstand
the
wear
and
tear
of
pillow
fights
and
of
use
as
seats
upon
the
floor
before
the
fire
better
than
almost
any
material
that
could
be
found
at
the
price
look
at
the
titles
of
these
and
see
if
i
have
a
right
to
be
primed
mother
and
jo
have
taken
turns
reading
to
me
for
a
week
they
too
are
possessed
of
an
extraordinary
amount
of
miscellaneous
information
miscellaneous
that
undoubtedly
the
word
it
will
be
a
long
day
before
any
of
us
have
any
classified
and
usable
knowledge
to
work
with
with
a
critical
eye
max
scanned
the
titles
of
the
books
as
jarvis
set
them
forth
in
an
impressive
row
upon
the
old
mahogany
table
where
the
reading
lamp
stood
surrounded
by
books
magazines
and
papers
in
generous
quantity
strawberries
market
gardening
analyses
of
the
soil
bacteria
nitrogen
drainage
agricultural
implements
increasing
the
fertility
of
the
land
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
max
murmured
as
his
eye
ran
hurriedly
along
the
subjects
represented
well
certainly
gone
in
deep
nearly
submerged
at
times
but
i
think
i
got
my
head
out
of
water
now
and
have
evolved
a
scheme
that
will
do
to
begin
on
with
your
approval
i
wish
you
go
at
the
reading
of
these
some
of
them
anyhow
i
marked
what
seemed
to
be
the
most
important
you
can
do
it
while
i
away
i
planning
to
take
a
trip
around
to
the
best
farms
i
can
hear
of
and
have
a
series
of
talks
with
the
owners
i
shall
end
up
with
a
scientific
experiment
station
for
by
that
time
i
ought
to
have
some
working
knowledge
to
build
on
and
can
understand
what
i
trying
to
get
at
from
among
his
pillows
max
gazed
at
his
friend
saturday
afternoon
was
always
a
time
of
relaxation
for
the
bank
clerk
when
he
could
get
through
with
his
work
and
hurry
home
he
did
not
as
yet
feel
a
particle
of
enthusiasm
over
the
farming
plans
and
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
comprehend
jarvis
interest
but
he
had
ceased
to
oppose
the
project
except
by
comments
skeptical
to
a
degree
jarvis
was
to
assume
the
risk
of
all
expensive
experiments
during
the
first
two
seasons
and
max
was
not
to
leave
the
bank
so
there
was
everything
to
be
gained
and
nothing
to
be
lost
by
giving
the
experimenter
a
free
hand
jarvis
was
sitting
bolt
upright
by
the
table
his
shoulders
back
his
head
up
energy
in
every
outline
sally
studying
him
and
remembering
his
long
exile
from
all
active
labour
while
his
eyes
were
recovering
from
their
misuse
at
college
silently
rejoiced
in
his
appearance
of
vigour
just
now
as
he
spoke
of
his
plans
he
seemed
especially
full
of
life
and
determination
and
the
contrast
between
the
two
young
men
was
one
which
made
the
girl
wonder
rather
anxiously
if
they
could
really
become
partners
in
this
new
enterprise
when
will
you
go
max
inquired
wish
i
were
tied
to
a
desk
i
go
too
for
the
trip
i
wish
you
could
you
enjoy
not
only
the
trip
but
the
interviews
guarantee
your
interest
before
we
made
half
our
rounds
any
idea
what
you
make
the
chief
crop
max
inquired
his
eyes
again
wandering
over
the
titles
of
the
books
strawberries
his
prospective
partner
responded
at
once
strawberries
expect
to
make
a
living
off
those
strawberries
this
was
sally
in
a
tone
of
delight
lovely
help
pick
can
we
have
them
next
june
ought
we
to
have
sowed
them
last
fall
a
roar
from
the
young
man
on
the
couch
and
an
irrepressible
broad
smile
on
the
face
of
the
one
by
the
table
made
sally
colour
with
chagrin
i
suppose
i
said
something
awful
she
queried
max
and
i
make
worse
blunders
than
that
before
we
are
through
jarvis
consoled
her
while
max
chuckling
attempted
to
instruct
his
sister
and
prove
that
after
all
he
did
know
a
thing
or
two
about
farming
you
do
sow
strawberries
for
a
crop
he
explained
wisely
you
set
out
plants
and
you
do
get
a
crop
the
first
year
either
eh
jarve
so
sally
need
begin
to
make
a
to
wear
picking
berries
next
june
nor
the
second
june
either
perhaps
admitted
jarvis
reluctantly
to
get
the
best
results
we
should
use
land
that
just
been
ploughed
where
there
been
only
sod
for
years
we
ought
to
plant
potatoes
or
cabbages
the
first
year
to
get
the
ground
in
shape
then
it
need
a
lot
of
fertilizing
after
that
we
have
to
get
rid
of
the
grubs
in
the
old
sod
grubs
max
sat
upright
with
a
jerk
there
you
are
at
the
first
drop
of
the
hat
grubs
pests
not
only
after
you
get
your
plants
out
but
two
seasons
beforehand
he
eyed
his
friend
as
if
he
had
presented
a
conclusive
argument
against
strawberry
raising
but
jarvis
only
laughed
that
part
of
the
game
said
he
meanwhile
there
are
some
quick
crops
we
ought
to
be
able
to
market
the
first
year
but
after
talking
with
several
city
dealers
and
commission
men
i
confident
it
will
pay
us
to
go
about
strawberry
culture
with
the
most
careful
preparation
we
can
make
some
cities
are
surrounded
by
strawberry
gardeners
but
almost
nobody
in
that
business
around
here
no
reason
why
not
soil
and
climate
all
right
enough
so
it
seems
to
me
it
our
chance
the
city
gets
most
of
its
strawberries
from
a
hundred
miles
away
which
means
that
they
ca
be
marketed
as
fresh
as
ours
can
be
i
propose
to
build
up
a
demand
for
absolutely
fresh
berries
picked
at
dawn
and
marketed
before
the
dew
is
off
strictly
fine
to
the
bottom
of
the
basket
several
grades
but
our
reputation
on
the
big
ones
of
course
there
no
reason
why
we
ca
do
it
but
he
had
gone
as
far
as
could
have
been
expected
without
an
ironic
comment
from
max
oh
it
all
clear
as
daylight
that
young
man
agreed
even
the
grubs
that
infest
the
soil
now
will
take
to
the
woods
when
they
hear
of
the
onslaught
that
coming
we
only
to
set
out
the
plants
sit
on
the
fence
till
the
gigantic
berries
are
ripe
than
haul
in
the
nets
no
may
freezes
no
droughts
no
you
a
pessimist
are
you
jarvis
broke
in
i
know
of
only
one
thing
that
will
ever
work
a
reformation
in
you
and
that
a
work
in
the
open
air
pessimist
am
i
well
it
was
sally
who
interrupted
this
time
during
jarvis
explanation
of
his
plan
she
had
been
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
a
new
idea
she
proceeded
to
launch
it
against
the
tide
of
max
retort
and
her
enthusiastic
shriek
overbore
his
growl
i
a
name
for
this
place
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
a
name
i
tried
and
tried
to
think
of
one
you
know
jarvis
and
nothing
has
suited
uncle
maxwell
never
named
it
anything
uncle
timothy
thinks
would
be
a
good
name
but
i
sure
there
are
hundreds
of
country
places
called
alec
says
and
bob
votes
for
though
there
no
far
view
at
all
till
you
get
up
to
the
hill
by
the
timber
lot
but
now
i
have
the
name
she
spoke
impressively
and
they
both
looked
at
her
waiting
for
the
revelation
about
to
fall
from
her
lips
she
did
not
keep
them
waiting
long
silence
ensued
sally
looked
from
one
to
the
other
max
began
to
laugh
better
call
it
strawberry
said
he
it
certainly
an
original
name
mused
jarvis
not
a
one
certainly
but
you
do
want
a
name
for
a
farm
it
a
nice
colourful
name
argued
sally
now
by
all
that
eccentric
what
a
colourful
name
demanded
jarvis
laughing
think
of
strawberries
among
the
green
leaves
in
the
sun
jarvis
have
green
leaves
on
all
the
baskets
and
think
of
crushed
strawberries
and
the
beautiful
rich
red
juice
it
a
nice
rich
name
just
as
my
curtains
make
a
warm
room
jarvis
shook
his
head
these
are
mysteries
too
deep
for
my
imagination
he
owned
but
you
can
call
it
if
you
like
that
a
colourful
name
too
i
should
judge
a
fine
natural
yellow
oh
sally
exclaimed
we
must
raise
pumpkins
among
the
corn
of
course
we
have
corn
pumpkins
lying
about
among
shocks
of
corn
in
the
fall
sunshine
make
the
most
delightful
picture
max
lay
back
among
his
pillows
apparently
overcome
with
emotion
oh
you
a
practical
person
for
a
farmer
housekeeper
he
jeered
your
one
idea
will
be
to
have
the
crops
look
pretty
in
the
sunshine
you
be
tying
ribbons
on
the
strawberry
baskets
to
match
the
fruit
sally
nodded
maybe
i
shall
she
acknowledged
anyhow
i
know
people
buy
the
things
that
are
most
artfully
put
up
a
loud
bang
of
the
front
door
made
her
pause
to
listen
hurried
footsteps
clattering
through
the
hall
prepared
the
party
for
the
bursting
open
of
the
door
bob
his
cheeks
like
winter
apples
his
boots
crusted
with
snow
shouted
at
the
company
oh
pull
yourselves
loose
from
this
stuffy
fire
and
come
up
on
the
hill
mr
ferry
toboggan
goes
like
lightning
express
from
the
top
of
the
hill
clear
down
to
the
big
elm
in
the
middle
of
the
south
meadow
he
a
dandy
at
it
i
ca
steer
the
thing
yet
at
all
but
he
teach
me
put
on
your
duds
and
come
on
he
sent
me
for
you
max
settled
himself
more
reposefully
than
ever
among
his
pillows
go
he
commanded
my
are
not
for
work
but
sally
sprang
to
her
feet
seeing
which
jarvis
got
promptly
to
his
sorry
we
have
blanket
tobogganing
suits
bob
said
jarvis
but
we
can
try
it
in
derby
hats
and
kid
gloves
i
ready
sally
rushed
away
to
array
herself
in
a
miscellaneous
costume
composed
of
max
gray
bob
crimson
skating
cap
uncle
white
muffler
and
a
short
skirt
of
her
own
the
others
eyed
her
approvingly
as
she
rejoined
them
the
crimson
cap
on
her
blonde
curls
proving
most
picturesque
out
of
doors
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
stung
by
the
frosty
air
presently
brought
them
to
match
the
cap
by
the
time
the
three
reached
the
hill
they
looked
as
ready
for
sport
as
donald
ferry
himself
that
young
man
in
a
regulation
toboggan
suit
of
gray
blanket
cloth
with
a
cap
of
the
same
looked
like
a
jolly
boy
as
he
brought
the
toboggan
into
place
with
a
flourish
and
invited
his
guests
to
pile
on
it
was
glorious
fun
certainly
ferry
was
an
accomplished
tobogganist
for
he
steered
with
great
skill
over
a
somewhat
complicated
course
including
excursions
between
trees
set
rather
closely
together
over
hummocks
and
through
erratic
dips
at
a
pace
which
quite
took
his
passengers
breath
away
it
the
best
fun
i
ever
had
in
my
life
cried
sally
as
they
climbed
the
hill
for
the
third
time
what
a
shame
for
max
not
to
come
we
have
him
out
next
time
to
taste
tobogganing
is
to
become
an
enthusiast
declared
ferry
walking
at
one
side
of
the
crimson
cap
while
jarvis
kept
close
upon
the
other
alec
and
bob
were
doing
tricks
in
the
snow
all
the
way
up
the
hill
to
the
amusement
of
uncle
timothy
rudd
who
watched
interestedly
from
the
top
but
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
try
a
journey
suddenly
sally
looked
down
toward
the
house
she
shielded
her
eyes
with
one
hand
there
mary
ann
flinders
watching
at
the
kitchen
window
she
exclaimed
poor
child
how
she
must
envy
us
she
stopped
short
and
looked
at
the
toboggan
owner
why
ca
we
ask
her
up
for
a
little
while
mr
ferry
she
suggested
you
would
mind
would
you
not
in
the
least
shall
i
go
for
her
i
go
please
do
come
and
sally
was
off
like
the
wind
down
over
the
path
which
much
tramping
had
made
through
the
snow
jarvis
and
ferry
looked
at
one
another
and
smiled
do
you
know
another
girl
in
the
world
who
would
have
thought
of
doing
that
asked
jarvis
with
amusement
not
many
out
of
those
who
happened
to
have
devoted
cavaliers
beside
them
certainly
admitted
the
other
young
man
looking
after
the
rapid
transit
of
the
crimson
cap
across
the
snowy
fields
but
miss
sally
is
a
law
unto
herself
and
the
unexpected
is
the
thing
one
may
expect
from
her
every
time
yet
she
not
capricious
purely
for
the
sake
of
being
capricious
like
so
many
girls
she
can
be
counted
on
at
the
same
time
that
one
does
know
exactly
where
to
find
her
he
laughed
there
a
paradox
for
you
counted
on
to
do
the
thing
you
glad
afterward
she
has
done
supplemented
sally
old
friend
if
sally
could
have
heard
them
her
small
ears
burning
with
the
transition
from
cold
air
to
warm
as
in
the
kitchen
she
hurriedly
forced
mary
ann
protesting
with
feeble
giggles
into
whatsoever
garments
could
be
adapted
to
the
purpose
would
have
burned
even
more
fiercely
but
it
is
quite
safe
to
say
that
she
had
no
thought
whatever
of
the
effect
her
impulsive
little
act
might
have
upon
anybody
except
mary
ann
herself
chapter
xii
in
the
old
garden
mother
wo
you
drive
out
to
the
farm
with
us
jo
will
tell
you
i
drive
like
a
veteran
and
the
roads
are
bad
with
chains
on
the
rear
tires
jarvis
hand
was
on
the
door
as
he
spoke
he
wore
a
motorist
cap
coat
and
leather
gauntlets
burnside
shook
her
head
smiling
i
make
my
first
trip
into
the
country
when
the
chains
are
not
needed
son
give
sally
my
love
and
tell
her
that
now
spring
is
at
hand
i
shall
come
out
with
you
often
let
me
tell
her
you
come
out
and
spend
the
whole
season
there
furnish
the
west
side
of
the
house
take
joanna
share
expenses
and
chaperon
her
whom
joanna
josephine
burnside
sheathing
herself
in
veils
for
the
drive
in
the
chilly
early
april
air
glanced
at
her
brother
with
a
mischievous
air
she
forty
if
she
a
day
surely
she
does
need
i
wish
you
people
would
take
me
seriously
could
you
find
a
pleasanter
place
to
spend
the
summer
i
expect
to
spend
every
daylight
hour
of
every
day
there
from
the
fifteenth
of
april
on
then
it
you
who
need
the
chaperon
declared
josephine
uncle
timothy
rudd
is
dragon
enough
for
sally
i
shall
want
to
be
out
there
for
every
noon
meal
ca
break
off
work
and
rush
home
three
times
a
day
even
with
the
new
car
and
she
make
it
in
twenty
minutes
when
the
roads
are
good
i
shall
have
to
take
my
lunch
in
a
pail
like
my
farm
hands
if
you
do
come
for
i
not
going
to
cast
myself
on
the
lanes
for
food
except
now
and
then
come
on
i
ready
talk
to
me
about
it
on
the
way
out
and
when
i
come
back
i
put
it
to
mother
so
artfully
she
ca
refuse
and
josephine
took
the
control
of
the
out
of
her
brother
hand
jarvis
applied
himself
silently
to
his
until
they
were
out
of
the
city
for
although
after
a
month
practice
he
drove
with
considerable
skill
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
where
steering
through
city
traffic
becomes
purely
mechanical
but
once
on
the
open
road
with
few
vehicles
in
the
way
jarvis
continued
the
subject
do
you
think
mother
really
dislikes
the
idea
it
seems
to
me
the
most
practical
in
the
world
those
west
rooms
would
be
fine
furnished
with
summer
stuff
i
would
for
the
world
have
you
put
anything
in
them
that
would
make
the
other
part
of
the
house
look
shabby
by
contrast
jarvis
as
if
we
would
why
it
would
be
just
mattings
and
wicker
chairs
muslin
curtains
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
think
mother
rather
likes
the
idea
but
she
is
afraid
we
should
be
forcing
ourselves
on
them
as
we
did
last
summer
with
the
tent
she
does
doubt
they
would
all
like
it
except
max
but
he
so
queer
he
never
likes
what
he
expected
to
max
is
the
very
one
who
would
favour
it
this
time
he
said
the
other
day
he
wished
i
could
live
out
here
since
i
to
run
everything
this
season
i
said
i
like
mighty
well
to
be
on
the
ground
but
could
of
course
in
the
circumstances
unless
the
family
were
along
he
said
up
for
yourselves
in
the
west
wing
and
be
here
to
get
up
with
the
lark
in
the
approved
farmer
style
i
propose
to
sleep
till
the
last
minute
and
let
the
early
birds
get
all
the
worms
they
like
oh
he
was
only
joking
of
course
he
was
joking
but
i
feel
certain
he
favour
the
plan
he
has
reason
to
give
me
my
head
in
every
way
has
he
i
equipping
the
place
with
farm
tools
and
machines
at
my
own
expense
hiring
help
out
of
my
own
pocket
and
taking
all
the
risk
if
i
ca
have
the
west
wing
for
the
summer
i
send
back
that
that
arrived
yesterday
i
as
proud
of
it
as
i
am
of
the
car
would
you
dare
mention
it
to
sally
the
or
the
plan
if
she
likes
the
plan
as
well
as
she
does
the
harrow
she
welcome
it
with
open
arms
i
tell
you
if
i
could
strike
the
sparks
out
of
max
with
an
expensive
that
the
mere
sight
of
a
set
of
hoes
and
rakes
for
her
flower
garden
does
with
sally
i
be
content
no
i
do
dare
mention
it
to
sally
but
i
should
think
you
might
she
certainly
be
delighted
to
have
you
and
mother
there
and
she
has
to
have
me
there
anyhow
whether
she
likes
it
or
not
whether
she
likes
it
or
not
of
course
she
likes
it
are
you
and
she
the
best
friends
in
the
world
i
not
so
sure
sally
good
friends
with
everybody
but
best
in
the
world
well
i
do
know
his
tone
was
peculiar
josephine
looked
quickly
at
him
through
her
enveloping
veils
he
was
staring
at
the
road
ahead
as
the
driver
of
a
motor
through
april
mud
must
do
of
course
yet
his
sister
thought
she
detected
a
curious
compression
of
the
lips
not
due
wholly
to
the
strain
of
driving
under
difficulties
you
not
afraid
of
her
neighbour
are
you
ventured
the
girl
casually
as
if
she
meant
nothing
by
the
query
i
like
him
immensely
as
you
know
was
the
quick
reply
and
trust
him
too
like
a
brother
but
well
it
no
use
talking
about
it
it
a
fair
field
and
no
favours
and
i
ca
complain
of
that
but
i
rather
like
the
advantage
of
being
on
the
ground
all
summer
do
you
see
alone
there
even
though
i
off
in
the
fields
half
the
time
i
have
to
be
everlastingly
careful
that
i
do
make
myself
intrusive
with
you
and
mother
there
the
whole
situation
would
be
different
you
do
see
you
sis
he
looked
round
at
her
for
an
instant
to
search
her
face
beneath
the
masking
veils
confident
that
if
he
could
be
sure
of
her
sympathy
his
sister
was
the
strongest
ally
he
could
have
the
subject
had
never
been
brought
up
quite
so
definitely
between
them
before
although
jarvis
had
no
doubt
that
both
mother
and
sister
understood
the
long
persisting
intention
which
within
the
last
year
had
grown
in
him
so
overwhelmingly
strong
the
machine
after
the
manner
of
took
the
opportunity
of
his
momentary
relaxation
of
vigilance
to
skid
rather
alarmingly
in
a
particularly
slippery
section
of
clay
road
though
jarvis
promptly
brought
it
about
and
had
things
in
hand
again
josephine
forgot
to
answer
while
she
resumed
control
over
the
function
of
breathing
but
when
her
brother
gently
repeated
his
question
she
answered
warmly
indeed
i
do
boy
and
more
clearly
than
i
have
before
for
myself
i
should
love
to
spend
the
summer
with
sally
and
i
do
my
best
to
bring
it
about
that
was
all
he
wanted
and
he
plunged
into
talk
about
the
farm
what
had
been
done
what
was
being
done
and
what
remained
to
do
it
seemed
that
while
much
had
been
accomplished
a
mountain
of
tasks
remained
the
place
had
been
running
down
so
long
that
every
inch
of
it
required
immediate
taking
in
hand
there
not
much
to
expect
the
first
year
in
the
way
of
crops
he
explained
we
shall
plough
all
we
can
in
april
and
sow
it
in
may
to
buckwheat
buckwheat
what
do
you
want
of
that
nothing
but
to
turn
it
under
and
give
the
ground
a
chance
to
enrich
itself
all
the
north
meadow
we
shall
let
come
to
the
haying
by
the
way
that
be
a
jolly
time
for
you
to
be
there
i
believe
sally
has
great
plans
for
the
haying
the
old
apple
orchard
we
had
carefully
pruned
in
february
and
we
going
to
plough
it
sally
not
pleased
at
that
she
says
it
will
be
prettier
not
ploughed
but
the
poor
old
roots
need
to
be
saved
from
starving
we
nearly
came
to
blows
over
that
and
of
course
i
was
sorry
to
oppose
her
about
anything
that
has
to
do
with
the
beauty
of
the
place
but
the
quickest
road
to
lasting
improvement
is
the
one
we
must
take
and
i
hope
there
be
enough
more
blossoms
on
the
trees
in
the
future
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
grass
you
wo
lose
ground
with
sally
by
opposing
her
now
and
then
come
round
in
the
end
to
seeing
you
right
i
have
plenty
of
chances
to
win
favour
by
opposition
with
everybody
even
rudd
has
his
ideas
about
what
ought
to
be
because
of
what
was
when
he
was
a
boy
on
the
farm
up
in
new
hampshire
max
wanted
the
new
fence
posts
of
ash
though
locust
is
much
more
lasting
and
plenty
to
spare
in
the
timber
lot
as
for
the
neighbouring
farmers
they
already
keenly
alive
to
our
first
efforts
and
some
of
them
are
watching
eagerly
to
see
us
make
mistakes
but
not
all
there
are
several
who
are
progressive
enough
themselves
to
want
to
see
us
win
out
with
modern
methods
with
all
your
studying
i
suppose
you
make
some
mistakes
mistakes
dozens
of
them
but
we
wo
make
the
same
one
twice
jo
if
you
could
have
heard
those
fellows
talk
whom
i
heard
on
my
trip
the
ones
who
run
the
really
successful
farms
on
scientific
methods
you
wonder
at
my
interest
he
was
still
talking
away
when
he
turned
the
car
in
through
the
now
restored
gateway
it
may
be
worth
while
to
mention
that
the
first
thing
in
which
max
had
shown
a
real
interest
was
the
restoration
of
that
gateway
he
had
declared
nobody
knew
why
that
it
must
be
in
absolutely
correct
shape
before
the
neil
chases
came
through
it
again
so
the
mason
who
came
to
mend
the
broken
chimney
found
himself
much
to
his
surprise
put
first
at
the
stone
pillars
of
the
gateway
the
carpenter
also
who
arrived
prepared
to
repair
the
porch
columns
and
floor
and
to
mend
the
broken
shutters
was
led
at
once
by
the
young
master
of
the
place
to
the
gateway
and
instructed
that
he
must
make
the
old
gate
itself
substantial
and
hang
it
so
that
it
should
swing
true
but
although
it
was
nearly
six
months
since
the
chases
had
tried
to
buy
the
place
they
had
not
yet
driven
through
that
restored
gateway
possibly
they
did
not
care
to
be
in
haste
to
look
at
the
place
they
could
not
own
there
sally
in
the
old
garden
she
told
me
she
could
hardly
wait
to
begin
on
it
and
josephine
waved
her
hand
at
a
distant
figure
with
a
spade
in
its
hand
the
spade
was
promptly
cast
aside
and
the
worker
came
running
around
the
house
to
meet
the
arriving
car
is
she
looking
splendidly
sally
friend
murmured
in
her
brother
ear
as
the
figure
came
near
enough
for
a
pair
of
very
blooming
cheeks
to
show
clearly
in
the
april
sunshine
never
better
life
is
going
to
make
her
a
hebe
replied
the
driver
of
the
car
under
his
breath
though
he
kept
his
eyes
dutifully
on
the
roadway
until
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
and
he
had
stopped
his
engine
come
and
see
the
garden
and
listen
to
my
plans
commanded
sally
the
moment
her
friends
were
on
the
ground
no
i
do
mean
jarvis
i
know
he
has
more
important
business
in
the
orchard
or
the
barns
or
the
woods
or
the
south
lot
meadow
please
corrected
jarvis
with
a
smile
which
suggested
past
efforts
to
teach
sally
the
nomenclature
of
the
or
anywhere
that
he
can
walk
to
in
the
mud
and
come
back
covered
with
with
a
tear
in
his
coat
he
looks
happiest
when
his
clothes
are
most
demoralized
and
his
boots
thickest
with
clay
the
sign
of
your
true
farmer
urged
jarvis
but
sally
had
no
further
attention
to
bestow
on
him
and
immediately
led
josephine
away
over
the
damp
and
spongy
sod
to
that
portion
of
the
ground
at
the
rear
of
the
house
which
showed
by
a
few
lingering
signs
that
it
once
had
been
a
proud
and
stately
garden
you
see
the
old
box
border
is
still
in
pretty
good
condition
only
is
that
the
word
in
a
few
places
i
shall
try
to
fill
those
in
for
i
care
more
for
the
box
than
for
anything
i
could
have
see
how
it
outlines
all
those
funny
little
curving
paths
where
i
suppose
roses
and
larkspur
and
bleeding
hearts
and
used
to
grow
they
going
to
grow
again
if
i
can
make
them
lovely
i
can
see
it
now
and
phlox
sally
you
must
have
masses
of
phlox
and
and
mignonette
and
sweet
alyssum
and
and
and
sweet
peas
and
hollyhocks
only
the
hollyhocks
are
not
going
to
be
in
the
garden
but
in
a
long
row
back
there
to
screen
away
the
kitchen
garden
from
the
lawn
only
oh
dear
you
have
to
wait
so
long
for
the
things
you
want
most
hollyhocks
do
bloom
the
first
year
from
seed
and
i
want
to
see
them
there
this
first
summer
pink
and
white
and
red
and
yellow
in
the
sun
like
a
row
of
children
dressed
for
a
party
ca
you
get
plants
somewhere
perhaps
from
the
neighbours
only
country
people
do
go
in
much
for
the
flowers
now
they
have
and
hydrangeas
in
tubs
just
think
in
tubs
and
geraniums
in
tomato
cans
sally
not
all
of
them
they
have
nasturtiums
yes
and
pink
sweet
peas
beside
them
to
set
one
teeth
on
edge
by
the
way
my
sweet
peas
are
in
her
voice
proclaimed
triumph
and
she
led
the
way
down
one
of
the
damp
paths
to
a
sunny
spot
where
a
long
strip
of
freshly
raked
earth
showed
that
somebody
had
lately
been
at
work
bob
dug
it
up
for
me
uncle
timmy
fertilized
it
i
raked
it
and
planted
the
seeds
while
the
whole
family
stood
around
and
gave
advice
max
wanted
them
sowed
thinner
and
alec
thicker
i
consulted
the
seed
catalogue
and
the
directions
on
the
paper
packet
and
then
sowed
them
just
as
my
judgment
directed
as
you
have
a
particle
of
judgment
experience
you
mean
no
i
have
experience
but
i
consider
that
i
have
judgment
and
i
sowed
the
seeds
according
to
that
in
june
i
will
pick
you
a
gorgeous
bunch
of
them
in
june
if
i
not
away
somewhere
in
which
case
you
can
send
them
to
me
in
a
box
joey
burnside
sally
picked
up
a
rake
lying
in
the
path
and
brandished
it
fiercely
do
you
dare
to
go
away
anywhere
you
to
come
and
visit
me
from
june
till
september
how
would
may
till
november
do
still
better
the
idea
of
your
expecting
me
to
get
along
without
you
the
very
first
summer
i
live
in
a
place
big
enough
for
anybody
to
visit
me
in
you
can
go
off
to
your
fashionable
resorts
in
the
winter
if
you
want
to
i
can
spare
you
better
then
but
this
summer
jo
think
of
the
moonlight
nights
with
the
odour
of
mignonette
coming
up
to
the
porch
from
the
garden
i
do
think
the
odour
of
the
mignonette
would
carry
so
far
we
can
walk
within
range
then
and
the
evenings
on
the
porch
with
mr
ferry
and
his
sister
over
and
his
sister
friend
i
did
know
he
had
a
sister
or
that
the
sister
had
a
friend
she
been
in
germany
the
last
two
years
living
with
an
aunt
and
studying
music
the
piano
the
friend
has
a
voice
oh
we
have
the
jolliest
times
you
ca
think
and
in
july
will
be
the
haying
jo
we
have
larks
during
haying
real
country
larks
and
a
barn
dance
you
go
away
anywhere
not
even
for
a
house
party
say
you
wo
you
artful
schemer
i
do
see
how
i
can
and
josephine
looked
as
if
she
could
but
see
here
sally
i
could
come
and
visit
you
here
and
leave
mother
alone
you
know
she
would
go
with
me
if
it
were
to
the
mountains
or
to
the
i
love
to
have
her
come
too
said
sally
quickly
if
she
would
care
to
how
i
wish
she
would
then
i
should
have
to
bother
mrs
ferry
to
come
over
every
time
we
had
the
young
people
all
here
if
i
could
just
furnish
the
west
wing
for
you
why
not
let
us
furnish
it
josephine
jumped
at
her
opportunity
somehow
during
the
last
few
minutes
she
had
become
firmly
convinced
that
she
could
not
think
of
spending
the
summer
months
anywhere
but
at
the
farm
all
sorts
of
pictures
had
leaped
into
her
mind
at
outlines
of
what
the
summer
was
to
be
the
stage
seemed
set
for
happenings
of
extraordinary
interest
from
which
she
did
not
want
to
be
left
out
there
would
be
other
things
going
on
at
the
old
place
besides
ploughings
and
plantings
harvestings
and
threshings
or
perhaps
it
might
be
that
these
very
terms
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
might
come
to
be
used
significantly
of
doings
in
the
human
sphere
of
action
sally
looked
up
with
a
flash
of
protest
in
her
eyes
let
you
furnish
it
she
exclaimed
oh
but
i
could
i
know
what
your
furnishing
it
would
mean
persian
rugs
and
silk
hangings
satsuma
jars
and
bowls
filled
with
roses
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
our
poor
things
would
look
she
stopped
short
and
was
silent
for
an
instant
then
i
an
envious
pig
she
owned
if
you
only
come
you
may
furnish
it
in
teak
wood
and
chinese
embroidery
and
i
be
contented
on
my
bare
floors
but
josephine
affectionate
arm
was
around
her
friend
shoulders
sally
lunn
said
she
soothingly
give
us
credit
for
better
taste
than
that
entirely
from
the
standpoint
of
harmony
in
a
summer
home
on
a
farm
people
of
sense
do
use
persian
rugs
or
teak
wood
we
put
plain
white
straw
matting
on
the
floors
hang
muslin
curtains
at
the
windows
and
use
the
simplest
willow
furniture
to
be
had
the
windows
should
be
open
every
minute
and
there
would
be
bowls
of
roses
about
only
rather
it
would
be
or
sally
do
you
adore
the
with
their
dear
spicy
smell
and
the
bowls
themselves
would
be
cut
glass
i
despise
cut
glass
for
flowers
and
so
do
you
now
will
you
let
us
come
sally
looked
at
her
friend
for
a
minute
thinking
as
she
did
so
that
for
a
rich
girl
josephine
burnside
possessed
the
sweetest
common
sense
ever
owned
by
anybody
then
she
dropped
her
rake
and
pulled
at
josephine
hand
come
she
cried
let
go
back
and
look
at
the
west
wing
and
the
bedrooms
over
it
are
the
nicest
in
the
house
i
have
used
them
only
because
they
were
so
big
but
you
wo
care
how
many
acres
of
straw
matting
have
to
be
used
to
cover
them
do
you
think
max
will
be
willing
for
us
to
come
josephine
asked
with
some
anxiety
as
they
went
in
you
remember
about
the
tent
oh
he
anxious
now
to
get
jarvis
on
the
ground
and
he
spoken
more
than
once
about
the
desirability
of
our
renting
some
of
our
unused
space
only
of
course
i
would
hear
of
it
before
to
strangers
josephine
plunged
into
details
they
would
bring
joanna
for
the
season
that
paragon
of
cooks
she
should
assist
mary
ann
at
which
sally
laughed
and
said
that
if
incompetent
little
mary
ann
could
assist
dignified
competent
joanna
it
would
be
a
matter
for
congratulation
we
all
dine
together
every
night
in
the
big
with
all
the
windows
also
open
and
more
flowers
on
the
table
josephine
would
have
gone
on
to
further
details
but
as
they
crossed
the
hall
to
the
west
wing
the
knocker
on
the
front
door
banged
with
a
decisive
sound
and
sally
opened
to
find
donald
ferry
on
the
threshold
i
came
on
a
matter
of
business
said
he
when
he
had
shaken
hands
if
you
can
call
asking
a
favour
business
shall
i
plunge
into
it
a
certain
storage
house
in
a
city
near
our
old
home
has
gone
out
of
commission
and
we
are
notified
that
everything
my
mother
has
had
stored
there
since
we
left
the
home
must
be
moved
at
once
now
that
my
sister
and
her
friend
are
to
be
here
with
us
through
the
summer
we
should
like
to
have
my
sister
piano
where
she
could
use
it
but
he
spread
out
his
arms
with
a
gesture
conveying
the
idea
of
great
proportions
the
piano
is
a
grand
and
not
a
miniature
grand
at
that
concert
size
we
possibly
put
it
in
our
little
house
would
it
be
asking
too
much
of
you
to
allow
it
to
stand
in
one
of
your
rooms
through
the
summer
where
janet
could
do
some
practising
on
it
i
assure
you
her
practising
is
of
the
nature
of
a
morning
musicale
he
added
as
if
sally
might
need
assurance
in
the
matter
sally
turned
to
josephine
it
a
special
providence
said
she
solemnly
to
keep
me
from
envying
you
your
matting
and
willow
furniture
will
you
have
a
concert
grand
in
the
west
wing
i
trow
not
then
she
answered
to
her
questioner
of
course
we
shall
be
delighted
she
told
him
and
as
i
say
it
will
have
a
chastening
effect
on
the
burnside
family
who
are
thinking
of
furnishing
our
west
wing
and
spending
the
summer
with
us
i
sure
they
wo
think
of
bringing
a
grand
piano
out
here
donald
ferry
looked
greatly
pleased
at
this
news
that
fine
said
he
mother
has
been
promising
miss
constance
carew
and
janet
all
sorts
of
pleasures
in
the
country
and
i
should
say
this
makes
a
sure
thing
of
it
if
four
girls
on
a
farm
ca
have
a
good
time
together
even
when
not
aided
and
abetted
by
as
many
boys
there
will
be
something
wrong
with
them
and
the
boys
ca
we
be
called
boys
that
great
news
and
i
may
tell
mother
you
will
prove
your
good
friendship
by
taking
the
white
elephant
of
a
piano
may
we
send
it
right
away
you
see
since
it
must
be
moved
at
once
it
had
best
come
where
it
is
to
stay
and
we
send
around
a
tuner
please
use
it
all
you
can
just
to
keep
it
in
good
shape
i
not
the
tiniest
sort
of
a
musician
said
sally
regretfully
but
josephine
is
she
keep
it
in
tune
for
you
i
merely
see
that
it
dusted
when
he
had
gone
sally
and
josephine
looked
at
each
other
miss
burnside
said
sally
solemnly
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
that
you
and
miss
ferry
and
miss
carew
and
miss
lane
are
to
take
part
this
summer
in
a
melodrama
of
thrilling
interest
country
setting
background
of
with
cows
coming
down
the
lane
curtain
rises
to
the
time
of
lavender
miss
burnside
is
discovered
on
head
rake
in
hand
pretending
to
accomplish
the
bunching
up
of
one
before
the
sun
goes

in

time

miss
burnside
gives
one
glance
at
her
rival
but
a
warm
hand
over
sally
saucy
mouth
and
a
protesting
sally
lane
if
you
begin
that
sort
of
thing
i
wo
live
a
minute
in
your
west
wing
put
an
end

stage

dear
agreed
sally
we
wo
talk
any
such
silly
stuff
we

if

go

we
will
when

i
hope
do
you

that
carew
is
as
grand
as
she
sounds
chapter
xiii
afternoon
tea
i
feel
said
sally
lane
impressively
that
the
way
to
receive
them
properly
is
to
have
afternoon
tea
on
the
lawn
what
is
the
use
of
having
a
lawn
even
though
it
still
rather
hummocky
and
four
magnificent
ancestral
oaks
ancestral
oaks
sounds
like
an
english
novel
if
we
have
afternoon
tea
on
it
under
them
she
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
front
room
in
the
west
wing
where
burnside
and
josephine
were
sitting
the
one
busy
with
some
small
piece
of
sewing
the
other
writing
letters
at
a
desk
are
they
coming
over
before
we
call
on
them
josephine
inquired
with
poised
pen
coming
why
they
only
arrived
last
night
i
saw
mr
ferry
this
morning
and
he
said
he
did
not
want
to
wait
for
us
to
come
over
with
our
hats
and
gloves
on
and
call
he
wanted
to
bring
the
girls
and
his
mother
over
this
afternoon
so
as
to
lose
no
time
in
having
them
find
out
what
was
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hedge
i
asked
him
why
he
had
brought
them
with
him
then
it
was
at
eight
this
morning
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
bring
them
himself
and
he
was
then
on
his
way
to
his
car
otherwise
he
thought
he
should
not
have
hesitated
at
all
on
account
of
the
hour
he
said
they
were
crazy
to
come
sally
he
did
say
they
were
to
come
he
did
use
that
particular
word
perhaps
men
never
do
of
course
but
he
said
or
or
something
like
that
it
means
the
same
thing
evidently
they
been
told
all
about
us
what
would
you
give
jo
burnside
to
know
how
we
been
described
we
probably
have
been
described
men
never
describe
people
they
just
say
all
right
you
like
her
or
something
equally
vague
it
would
give
me
a
chance
to
wear
my
lilac
muslin
mused
sally
quite
irrelevantly
but
josephine
caught
her
meaning
afternoon
tea
on
the
lawn
then
do
let
have
it
anything
to
see
you
in
that
lilac
muslin
then
we
trail
over
the
lawn
to
meet
them
only
the
lilac
muslin
does
trail
and
we
hold
out
our
hands
at
a
medium
sort
of
angle
so
that
we
be
prepared
to
reciprocate
whatever
sort
of
shake
fresh
from
abroad
they
give
us
since
dorothy
chase
came
back
last
fall
she
gives
a
jerk
that
stops
your
breath
short
just
where
it
happens
to
be
at
the
moment
what
do
you
suppose
they
be
like
young
ladies
from
two
years
residence
in
germany
or
just
plain
jolly
girls
josephine
shook
her
head
but
her
mother
replied
in
a
quiet
tone
of
conviction
i
doubt
if
the
daughter
of
that
family
will
be
anything
but
a
girl
no
matter
how
experienced
she
may
be
in
foreign
usages
sally
nodded
so
i
hoping
but
carew
with
a
voice
sounds
more
formidable
it
for
miss
carew
i
going
to
have
afternoon
tea
i
go
out
now
and
make
my
little
cakes
and
i
have
very
very
thin
bread
and
butter
i
just
one
cherished
jar
of
the
choicest
orange
pekoe
so
the
tea
will
be
above
reproach
and
my
one
pride
is
my
linen
you
know
how
much
mother
always
kept
not
only
her
own
but
grandmother
rudd
then
she
vanished
quite
suddenly
from
the
doorway
as
if
having
once
mentioned
the
mother
of
whom
she
seldom
spoke
she
could
not
come
back
again
to
other
subjects
until
a
period
of
silence
had
intervened
i
so
anxious
to
see
her
put
away
the
black
clothes
said
josephine
to
her
mother
it
will
be
good
for
her
to
wear
the
lilac
muslin
for
now
she
made
it
she
ca
bring
herself
to
put
it
on
though
she
knows
how
we
all
want
to
see
her
in
colours
again
speaking
of
colours
jarvis
said
this
morning
that
by
the
fence
in
the
south
meadow
the
grass
was
blue
with
wild
violets
i
believe
i
go
and
pick
a
big
bunch
for
it
seems
rather
early
for
tea
on
the
lawn
suggested
burnside
though
i
could
bear
to
damp
sally
ardour
by
saying
so
oh
it
really
very
warm
and
the
lawn
seems
quite
dry
i
blame
sally
for
wanting
to
show
off
the
oaks
it
almost
like
june
but
alas
for
plans
which
count
upon
the
most
may
weather
no
guests
were
served
with
afternoon
tea
that
day
except
under
a
roof
more
substantial
than
the
boughs
of
the
great
oaks
at
treacherously
enough
the
sky
showed
not
a
cloud
except
over
beyond
the
timber
lot
where
they
had
risen
to
some
height
before
they
could
be
discerned
from
the
lawn
there
sally
was
laying
her
fine
linen
cloth
setting
out
her
thin
teacups
of
the
old
china
and
arranging
josephine
blue
in
a
curious
engraved
glass
bowl
of
grandmother
rudd
a
small
gust
of
wind
lifting
the
edges
of
the
heavy
damask
cloth
and
nearly
capsizing
the
violets
first
called
her
attention
to
a
change
in
the
weather
uncle
timothy
bringing
out
chairs
at
her
behest
paused
and
scanned
the
horizon
with
an
experienced
eye
looks
a
little
dubious
to
me
sally
he
observed
although
he
came
on
with
his
chairs
company
due
pretty
soon
it
four
they
come
very
soon
for
i
sent
word
that
have
tea
early
on
account
of
its
growing
cool
after
five
yes
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
dark
cloud
in
the
south
beyond
the
woods
but
you
think
it
will
bring
rain
right
away
do
you
if
it
begins
to
blow
it
will
look
out
there
for
another
brisk
little
zephyr
lifted
the
corner
of
the
cloth
again
and
threatened
the
teacups
weather
changes
pretty
suddenly
sometimes
in
may
but
the
sun
is
so
bright
and
a
minute
ago
i
was
thinking
that
it
was
lucky
the
branches
are
so
thick
on
this
old
oak
for
the
sunshine
was
really
uncomfortably
hot
it
ca
rain
right
away
i
bring
out
everything
and
be
ready
to
offer
them
tea
the
minute
they
said
afternoon
sally
hurried
away
to
the
house
leaving
uncle
timothy
standing
guard
over
the
and
keeping
a
weather
eye
on
the
gathering
patch
of
clouds
but
it
could
rain
right
away
as
it
presently
proved
by
the
time
sally
crossed
the
lawn
with
her
plates
of
bread
and
butter
and
tiny
sugary
cakes
mary
ann
following
with
the
tray
holding
the
tea
equipage
there
were
strong
indications
of
what
was
soon
to
happen
sally
had
not
more
than
decided
that
it
was
best
to
retreat
to
the
porch
and
await
developments
than
the
first
drops
on
her
upturned
forehead
warned
her
that
the
retreat
could
not
be
too
hasty
the
ferry
party
coming
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
a
few
minutes
earlier
than
they
would
have
done
if
it
had
not
seemed
expedient
to
forestall
the
gathering
shower
saw
the
scurrying
hosts
jarvis
and
max
were
with
them
for
it
was
saturday
afternoon
the
ferrys
themselves
were
forced
to
make
haste
also
and
as
a
result
guests
and
hostess
and
chairs
and
violets
reached
the
shelter
of
the
big
porch
at
nearly
the
same
time
and
sixty
seconds
later
the
first
pursuing
dash
of
rain
rattled
against
the
pillars
it
too
bad
cried
sally
breathless
and
laughing
as
she
turned
around
to
greet
her
guests
little
curls
escaping
about
her
forehead
and
over
her
ears
in
spite
of
all
her
previous
care
to
insure
their
smooth
order
but
her
hand
gave
warm
welcome
all
around
the
circle
and
she
led
the
party
into
the
wide
hall
now
transformed
by
the
waxing
of
its
dark
floor
and
the
presence
of
several
rag
rugs
into
a
entrance
put
the
here
by
the
open
door
please
max
she
directed
we
be
as
near
out
of
doors
as
we
can
at
the
first
sound
of
voices
burnside
and
josephine
had
appeared
and
between
them
things
were
in
order
in
the
new
setting
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
a
great
bunch
of
daffodils
on
an
old
table
near
the
door
made
the
spot
seem
quite
festive
enough
for
the
occasion
and
sally
when
she
had
caught
her
breath
and
pushed
back
the
distracting
curls
proved
herself
to
possess
a
fair
amount
of
the
poise
of
the
accustomed
hostess
whom
nothing
can
really
upset
she
rearranged
her
just
inside
the
hall
door
and
before
she
had
finished
a
dash
of
sunshine
fell
across
it
making
her
declare
as
she
settled
the
bowl
of
violets
that
if
the
shower
could
just
have
confined
its
efforts
to
her
garden
which
needed
watering
and
not
to
sprinkling
the
lawn
which
did
need
it
she
would
not
have
felt
so
ungrateful
to
it
and
we
came
especially
to
see
the
garden
said
janet
ferry
heard
of
that
garden
in
every
letter
since
the
first
of
april
she
looked
at
her
brother
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
hazel
eyes
much
like
his
own
do
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
said
sally
serenely
preparing
to
make
her
tea
and
sending
max
for
the
hot
water
the
really
important
things
like
the
coming
up
of
the
sweet
peas
or
unimportant
ones
like
the
strange
way
the
weeds
have
of
appearing
faster
than
the
seeds
from
the
nonchalance
of
this
question
it
will
be
seen
that
sally
herself
thought
nothing
of
the
fact
that
items
concerning
her
garden
should
have
seemed
of
sufficient
importance
to
go
into
the
letters
of
a
brother
whose
time
was
ordinarily
occupied
with
affairs
much
more
momentous
the
garden
was
of
overwhelming
importance
to
sally
why
should
it
be
interesting
to
everybody
but
there
were
two
people
in
the
company
besides
his
sister
who
glanced
rather
quickly
at
donald
ferry
he
however
seemed
to
think
there
could
be
no
reason
for
anybody
minding
what
he
might
choose
to
write
about
here
were
two
girls
he
said
from
his
position
in
the
doorway
where
he
stood
leaning
against
the
lintel
watching
the
process
of
tea
making
writing
long
descriptions
of
all
sorts
of
rural
beauties
they
had
discovered
in
their
travels
about
germany
and
france
given
them
as
a
reward
for
long
study
by
a
discerning
aunt
they
professed
special
interest
in
gardens
should
i
refrain
from
telling
them
about
the
only
one
in
sight
even
though
it
could
be
said
to
have
reached
the
show
stage
you
certainly
did
refrain
said
miss
constance
carew
smiling
at
him
from
her
seat
near
sally
we
were
told
that
if
we
would
spend
the
summer
here
one
of
our
chief
joys
would
be
the
old
garden
so
long
as
it
helped
to
bring
you
i
do
regret
it
said
he
returning
the
smile
in
a
way
which
made
those
who
observed
decide
at
once
that
these
other
two
were
old
and
familiar
friends
miss
carew
though
she
was
not
precisely
a
pretty
girl
was
really
beautiful
when
she
smiled
and
had
at
all
times
an
undeniable
charm
about
her
which
came
from
one
knew
not
just
what
she
was
rather
tall
but
very
graceful
and
her
manner
had
about
it
an
indefinable
something
which
made
one
like
to
watch
her
admiring
each
move
she
made
as
something
done
just
a
little
differently
from
the
way
other
people
did
it
sally
poured
her
tea
and
the
three
young
men
handed
about
the
cups
everybody
fell
to
talking
at
once
max
who
had
had
an
approving
eye
on
miss
janet
ferry
from
the
first
and
had
decided
that
he
should
much
prefer
her
conversation
to
that
of
her
more
impressive
friend
drew
up
a
chair
beside
her
when
his
duties
were
over
and
presently
proved
her
to
be
as
blithely
entertaining
as
her
appearance
had
promised
she
was
a
small
person
in
stature
but
her
personality
was
one
not
to
be
ignored
she
looked
like
a
miniature
edition
of
her
brother
heavy
braids
of
the
same
hair
wound
about
her
small
head
the
same
brilliant
hazel
eyes
looking
out
of
a
prepossessing
young
face
and
the
same
seemingly
quick
appreciation
of
everything
other
people
said
and
did
making
her
a
delightful
person
to
talk
with
max
as
he
supplied
her
with
plied
her
with
questions
about
her
life
in
germany
and
listened
to
her
vivacious
stories
of
her
experiences
thinking
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
met
a
girl
he
liked
so
well
you
do
know
how
much
it
means
to
constance
and
janet
to
find
two
girls
of
their
own
sort
so
near
declared
donald
ferry
bringing
his
cup
to
take
it
with
josephine
close
beside
the
doorway
i
think
they
been
feeling
a
little
dubious
over
finding
us
out
here
in
a
place
which
had
neither
lake
seashore
nor
mountains
to
recommend
it
perhaps
they
still
feeling
so
suggested
josephine
there
not
much
about
tea
in
a
shower
to
cheer
their
spirits
do
they
look
as
if
they
needed
cheering
josephine
glanced
from
janet
laughing
at
something
max
was
apparently
describing
with
great
eloquence
to
constance
carew
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
looking
up
at
jarvis
who
stood
beside
her
with
the
smile
which
made
her
face
a
picture
to
study
it
delightful
for
us
i
sure
that
they
come
josephine
said
warmly
you
find
janet
up
to
the
wildest
schemes
for
sport
you
can
devise
and
constance
though
she
looks
so
stately
can
unbend
like
a
as
for
her
voice
you
must
hear
her
pretty
soon
janet
is
anxious
to
touch
her
old
piano
again
and
both
are
always
obliging
with
their
music
they
are
equal
to
quite
a
concert
between
them
so
we
been
hoping
sally
has
dusted
the
piano
no
less
than
five
times
in
anticipation
you
ca
think
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
sally
just
to
see
that
piano
standing
there
it
happens
to
be
almost
the
precise
duplicate
of
the
one
that
was
sold
when
her
old
home
was
broken
up
i
glad
i
hope
she
uses
it
not
in
a
way
that
she
would
let
me
call
using
it
she
sits
down
and
plays
little
bits
mostly
out
of
her
head
i
think
she
why
what
that
it
was
bob
tearing
by
the
front
door
and
yelling
as
he
ran
team
running
away
in
the
south
meadow
man
knocked
down
in
an
instant
three
teacups
clinked
and
clattered
as
they
were
set
hastily
down
and
three
male
figures
bolted
out
of
the
door
without
apology
further
than
three
ejaculations
of
surprise
and
chagrin
rudd
followed
at
a
brisk
walk
as
for
the
portion
of
the
company
remaining
they
also
put
aside
teacups
and
plates
and
followed
sally
to
the
they
ran
in
to
the
four
windows
of
the
long
room
between
two
of
which
stood
the
piano
janet
ferry
gave
it
a
private
nod
and
pat
as
she
went
by
whispering
you
dear
old
thing
i
speak
to
you
as
soon
as
i
can
they
could
see
the
runaway
team
a
plough
jerking
at
their
heels
dashing
madly
across
the
furrows
one
of
the
horses
apparently
much
wilder
than
the
other
they
saw
jarvis
ferry
and
max
reach
the
rail
fence
at
nearly
the
same
moment
and
go
over
it
at
a
rate
of
speed
which
suggested
danger
to
bob
could
be
discerned
racing
frantically
in
the
wake
of
the
careering
horses
and
in
the
nearer
distance
rudd
could
be
heard
shouting
something
wholly
unintelligible
one
of
the
running
figures
halted
near
the
fence
stooping
and
the
watching
eyes
understood
that
the
presumably
injured
ploughman
was
lying
there
it
don
that
has
stopped
said
janet
ferry
to
her
mother
now
he
probably
have
a
new
case
on
his
hands
i
do
hope
the
man
much
hurt
i
ca
stay
here
to
look
cried
sally
and
gathering
up
her
lilac
skirts
ran
away
out
of
the
room
in
a
moment
they
saw
her
flying
across
the
wet
grass
her
forgotten
i
am
going
too
and
janet
ferry
delicate
folds
of
pale
gray
silk
caught
up
as
sally
had
caught
up
her
muslin
was
off
in
sally
train
josephine
and
constance
carew
looked
at
each
other
the
guest
nodded
i
do
mind
the
wet
grass
said
she
though
one
glance
at
the
ephemeral
fabric
of
her
frock
made
josephine
say
as
the
two
hurried
to
the
hall
had
you
really
better
the
grass
is
soaking
who
cares
for
clothes
when
there
a
runaway
replied
miss
carew
besides
this
will
tub
and
yours
wo
but
the
man
may
be
badly
hurt
and
away
went
josephine
pumps
making
her
flight
a
trifle
dangerous
over
the
slippery
turf
and
her
guest
ran
at
her
side
by
the
time
they
reached
the
meadow
fence
the
team
had
been
brought
panting
to
a
standstill
cornered
by
bob
and
jarvis
at
the
far
end
of
the
meadow
when
donald
ferry
looked
up
from
the
prostrate
form
of
the
ploughman
he
beheld
four
figures
in
dainty
dresses
also
brought
to
a
by
a
splintery
rail
fence
over
which
it
did
not
seem
discretion
to
attempt
to
scramble
unless
the
need
were
dire
it
was
not
dire
jake
kelly
had
only
been
stunned
by
striking
his
head
upon
a
big
stone
just
upturned
by
his
plough
he
was
already
opening
his
eyes
and
the
colour
was
returning
to
his
sunburned
face
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
all
right
called
ferry
to
the
row
of
anxious
faces
by
the
fence
at
which
the
tense
expressions
relaxed
and
certain
dimples
began
to
play
if
nobody
were
seriously
hurt
the
situation
certainly
had
its
amusing
side
five
minutes
ago
they
had
all
been
demurely
drinking
afternoon
tea
with
the
most
correct
society
manners
evident
on
all
sides
they
had
not
known
each
other
very
well
but
each
had
wondered
what
the
others
were
like
upon
less
formal
occasions
and
suddenly
a
decidedly
less
formal
occasion
had
been
precipitated
into
their
midst
guess
i
ai
much
the
wuss
for
wear
declared
jake
kelly
sitting
up
all
hurt
my
feelin
at
havin
that
there
team
git
away
from
me
like
that
the
old
mare
steady
a
clock
thought
she
could
hold
the
young
one
down
if
he
did
git
lively
dunno
now
what
he
took
off
at
serves
me
right
for
trustin
a
minute
while
i
lit
up
my
pipe
bob
on
the
old
mare
back
and
jarvis
at
the
bits
of
the
young
horse
were
bringing
back
the
plough
undamaged
by
its
brisk
career
across
the
field
jarvis
certainly
presented
a
somewhat
incongruous
appearance
in
his
afternoon
attire
as
he
plunged
along
the
furrows
in
not
intended
for
locomotion
over
freshly
ploughed
land
jake
rose
to
his
feet
answering
the
queries
of
ferry
at
his
side
as
to
his
fitness
for
continuing
work
with
a
decided
sure
i
am
get
even
with
myself
for
that
fool
trick
till
i
done
a
good
dozen
furrows
you
do
ketch
that
there
pair
gittin
away
from
jake
kelly
again
this
day
the
rescue
party
may
as
well
go
back
to
the
teacups
observed
jarvis
as
the
whole
group
standing
partly
on
the
one
and
partly
on
the
other
side
of
the
rail
fence
watched
the
now
subdued
team
take
a
fresh
start
under
the
guidance
of
a
vigilant
driver
with
a
large
bump
on
the
back
of
his
head
which
he
had
refused
to
have
treated
in
any
way
but
with
contempt
saying
which
jarvis
mounted
the
fence
tearing
a
slight
rent
near
the
hem
of
his
because
he
was
not
looking
where
he
went
he
had
been
observing
the
effect
of
the
now
brilliant
sunshine
on
an
uncovered
fair
head
and
in
the
fashion
of
jake
he
accepted
the
proffered
sympathy
of
bob
on
the
disaster
to
his
clothing
with
a
murmured
serves
me
right
for
not
attending
strictly
to
business
the
company
marched
back
in
more
orderly
ranks
than
it
had
come
forth
max
found
himself
by
the
side
of
constance
carew
and
discovered
that
she
had
quite
as
strong
a
sense
of
humour
as
janet
ferry
for
she
described
to
him
most
amusingly
the
way
in
which
the
four
girls
had
abandoned
all
concern
for
their
afternoon
finery
and
had
rushed
forth
prepared
to
help
bear
a
stretcher
down
a
wet
ploughed
field
or
share
in
dashing
about
in
the
attempt
to
catch
the
runaway
team
this
is
what
comes
said
he
in
reply
and
looking
around
at
sally
with
mirth
in
his
eye
of
trying
to
be
fashionable
on
a
farm
trying
to
be
fashionable
cried
sally
behind
him
catching
the
words
i
was
merely
trying
to
be
hospitable
but
fate
evidently
did
mean
i
should
be
either
twice
in
one
afternoon
let
go
back
and
turn
the
into
a
musicale
suggested
ferry
i
know
my
sister
is
longing
to
get
her
hands
on
the
piano
you
should
propose
to
have
your
own
family
perform
janet
reproached
her
brother
why
should
i
i
have
heard
you
play
for
two
years
nor
constance
sing
for
three
no
false
modesty
shall
keep
me
from
demanding
to
be
satisfied
i
heard
somebody
telling
somebody
else
i
had
dusted
the
piano
five
times
said
sally
as
she
led
the
way
in
and
i
surely
ought
to
be
rewarded
for
such
care
as
that
so
they
trooped
in
a
somewhat
less
faultlessly
attired
party
than
they
had
gone
out
for
sally
curls
were
more
rebellious
than
ever
josephine
skirts
had
a
mud
stain
on
their
hem
jarvis
rent
showed
plainly
and
everybody
was
decidedly
the
worse
for
the
run
over
wet
sod
and
fresh
earth
but
they
had
left
behind
them
all
stiffness
born
of
untried
acquaintance
had
discovered
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
company
who
could
not
be
depended
upon
to
play
a
gallant
part
in
whatever
emergency
might
arise
and
were
in
a
mood
thoroughly
to
enjoy
the
remainder
of
the
visit
without
being
asked
again
janet
went
straight
to
the
piano
sat
down
at
it
as
if
it
were
the
old
friend
it
claimed
to
be
and
with
one
or
two
affectionate
soft
layings
of
her
hands
upon
it
in
almost
noiseless
chords
as
if
she
were
asking
it
something
to
which
it
responded
under
its
breath
swept
into
a
movement
from
one
of
the
greatest
compositions
the
world
knows
when
she
finished
she
looked
up
at
her
brother
who
had
come
to
stand
close
beside
the
instrument
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
his
were
by
no
means
free
from
a
suspicion
of
moisture
evidently
the
sound
of
the
familiar
keys
had
many
associations
for
both
and
they
were
associations
which
their
mother
shared
for
her
face
was
turned
away
toward
the
open
window
and
she
was
very
still
but
in
a
minute
more
janet
had
turned
to
beckon
to
her
friend
and
was
beginning
an
accompaniment
without
so
much
as
waiting
for
constance
to
reach
the
piano
smiling
the
tall
girl
found
a
place
beside
it
just
in
time
to
take
up
her
part
and
then
the
listeners
held
their
breath
the
golden
notes
rang
through
the
rooms
and
out
upon
the
warm
may
air
while
the
singer
herself
seemed
as
little
to
be
performing
as
if
the
song
had
been
a
mere
child
play
tune
what
made
you
start
with
that
protested
constance
in
her
ear
the
moment
it
was
over
such
a
show
song
but
donald
from
the
other
side
of
the
piano
leaned
across
mind
he
whispered
any
of
the
simple
things
would
have
done
us
out
just
now
constance
nodded
quickly
the
next
minute
with
a
word
to
janet
she
had
plunged
into
a
gay
little
german
song
with
a
spirit
in
it
as
light
as
the
spring
itself
and
every
one
was
smiling
when
they
had
gone
jarvis
passing
through
the
hall
with
a
glance
into
the
room
where
the
piano
stood
caught
a
glimpse
of
sally
standing
by
the
open
window
looking
after
the
four
who
were
just
disappearing
through
the
hedge
he
crossed
the
room
softly
and
looked
out
over
her
head
they
all
right
are
they
said
he
splendid
agreed
sally
i
like
them
both
even
more
than
i
expected
then
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
i
give
the
hair
off
my
head
to
be
able
to
make
such
music
as
that
either
with
my
hands
or
with
my
voice
jarvis
smiling
to
himself
unperceived
touched
one
fair
strand
with
a
reverent
hand
i
would
give
said
he
even
for
such
magnificent
music
as
that
so
much
as
that
one
curl
over
your
right
ear
if
another
would
grow
there
in
its
place
sally
faced
about
the
idea
said
she
of
course
you
would
not
yours
sir
to
give
but
i
cut
it
off
when
you
were
looking
chapter
xiv
two
and
two
shall
we
make
the
haying
a
society
affair
for
ladies
in
french
frocks
or
an
athletic
event
for
a
lot
of
young
fellows
who
do
know
a
rake
from
a
pitchfork
the
questioner
was
a
tall
young
man
in
corduroy
trousers
and
high
boots
a
blue
flannel
shirt
and
a
nondescript
hat
though
the
hat
had
come
off
as
he
approached
the
garden
where
sally
lane
in
blue
gingham
and
short
sleeves
was
carefully
setting
out
some
roots
sally
looked
up
she
had
become
accustomed
in
a
measure
to
seeing
the
heir
of
the
house
of
burnside
thus
attired
and
to
noting
the
daily
deepening
coat
of
tan
upon
his
face
and
arms
but
it
never
failed
to
strike
her
afresh
as
a
miracle
which
a
year
ago
would
not
have
seemed
possible
i
have
the
faintest
intention
of
inviting
any
ladies
in
french
frocks
she
replied
do
you
know
any
gentlemen
in
frock
coats
who
wish
to
be
asked
plenty
but
i
not
asking
any
invitations
for
them
this
time
no
it
a
bunch
of
the
reverend
donald
ferry
friends
i
want
to
invite
the
reverend
how
odd
that
sounds
who
are
they
messenger
boys
every
kind
of
boy
he
proposes
to
buy
or
borrow
the
rakes
and
pitchforks
have
out
a
different
set
of
lads
for
two
days
running
and
present
us
with
the
labour
of
the
crowd
in
return
for
the
lark
he
expects
it
to
be
for
them
janet
and
constance
will
supply
the
lunch
of
course
the
amount
of
work
the
boys
do
is
to
be
reckoned
on
like
that
of
trained
hands
but
our
ten
acres
of
hay
is
a
tremendous
crop
and
with
jake
kelly
and
myself
to
boss
the
job
we
ought
to
get
through
in
respectable
season
if
the
weather
favours
do
have
them
come
max
is
going
to
let
bob
have
his
way
at
last
and
leave
the
office
so
he
be
on
hand
too
good
bob
been
on
all
the
week
i
know
but
i
did
know
old
max
had
given
in
alec
will
be
the
next
deserter
from
the
ranks
of
the
business
men
max
may
hang
on
through
this
season
and
next
but
you
see
him
with
us
the
third
or
i
sacrifice
my
hat
he
surveyed
the
specimen
in
his
hands
as
he
spoke
valuable
offering
it
would
make
would
it
that
hat
began
its
career
at
a
university
and
ends
it
on
a
farm
in
my
present
state
of
mind
i
do
call
that
a
do
you
asked
a
voice
behind
him
and
jarvis
swung
round
to
behold
janet
ferry
gloves
and
weeding
instrument
in
hand
then
i
suppose
not
a
for
my
gloves
bought
in
berlin
worn
in
london
and
worn
out
in
sally
service
in
a
garden
composed
mostly
of
weeds
weeds
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
look
at
my
sally
indignantly
waved
an
hand
toward
the
trellis
where
three
pink
one
white
and
one
brilliant
crimson
blossom
flaunted
themselves
in
the
july
sunshine
as
the
first
blooms
of
the
season
i
take
it
back
admitted
janet
and
i
not
call
my
work
what
are
you
doing
idling
here
farmer
i
thought
you
never
allowed
a
moment
to
go
to
waste
i
not
wasting
any
now
disputed
the
farmer
i
merely
paused
a
moment
on
my
way
to
the
barn
where
i
intend
to
rig
up
a
fork
for
unloading
consulting
the
lady
of
strawberry
acres
about
letting
your
brother
boys
come
and
rake
hay
for
us
oh
yes
he
full
of
that
plan
i
give
you
fair
warning
sally
if
you
give
don
half
an
opening
he
have
you
overrun
here
with
his
protégés
have
you
the
least
idea
how
many
men
boys
and
babies
he
has
on
his
lists
and
every
one
of
them
is
a
personal
and
particular
friend
of
his
i
know
he
a
tremendous
worker
sally
rose
to
her
feet
and
surveyed
the
result
of
her
labours
they
look
dreadfully
droopy
do
they
you
need
more
water
i
get
it
and
jarvis
picked
up
her
and
was
off
with
it
i
shall
be
delighted
to
have
the
boys
come
janet
sally
went
on
heartily
i
think
your
brother
work
is
fine
great
and
if
the
old
farm
can
help
in
any
way
i
shall
be
glad
i
thought
you
were
arranging
to
have
a
from
town
and
i
was
afraid
his
plan
would
interfere
i
did
plan
that
some
time
ago
but
i
like
this
idea
much
better
the
use
of
exerting
ourselves
to
entertain
a
lot
of
indifferent
people
when
we
can
give
a
jolly
time
to
the
ones
who
never
have
any
fun
at
all
that
what
don
says
and
these
boys
are
his
special
care
he
has
for
them
in
the
city
and
he
working
now
to
get
all
sorts
of
additions
to
it
baths
and
showers
and
gymnasium
apparatus
oh
i
think
it
fine
too
i
did
at
first
when
he
wrote
me
about
it
but
now
that
i
here
and
see
for
myself
i
immensely
interested
and
want
to
help
they
discussed
the
coming
event
fully
as
they
worked
it
was
discussed
by
everybody
during
the
next
few
days
and
plans
were
carefully
perfected
with
the
view
of
combining
a
good
time
for
the
young
guests
with
the
serious
purpose
of
getting
the
haying
done
as
promptly
and
effectually
as
possible
so
on
a
certain
day
in
early
july
jake
kelly
cut
the
hay
the
entire
ten
acres
and
reported
a
fair
crop
for
land
that
had
been
running
wild
so
long
a
rather
rainy
spring
having
helped
matters
considerably
on
the
morning
of
the
next
day
ferry
boys
were
to
arrive
i
wish
it
were
a
holiday
for
me
admitted
max
as
he
left
the
house
to
catch
his
car
i
rather
enjoy
seeing
the
mess
ferry
and
jarve
get
into
with
a
corps
of
bootblacks
to
make
hay
for
them
they
all
right
mark
my
word
each
of
us
girls
is
going
to
drive
one
load
down
to
the
barn
called
sally
gayly
from
the
porch
as
he
ran
down
the
driveway
max
waved
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
despair
as
if
to
indicate
that
this
announcement
certainly
finished
the
prospect
of
getting
anything
done
on
the
farm
do
mind
him
said
jarvis
appearing
in
the
doorway
behind
her
going
to
drive
out
the
southville
road
about
five
miles
after
a
and
tackle
i
bought
of
a
man
who
selling
out
we
do
really
need
one
for
our
small
crop
but
it
too
cheap
to
refuse
back
in
a
jiffy
do
you
want
to
go
thank
you
too
busy
you
do
look
it
for
she
was
starting
away
at
a
moderate
pace
down
the
driveway
her
fresh
print
skirts
giving
forth
a
crisp
little
sound
as
she
walked
but
i
am
i
going
on
an
errand
which
way
down
the
road
mrs
hill
wait
a
minute
and
i
have
you
there
quicker
than
you
can
walk
he
ran
in
for
his
and
out
through
the
back
hall
to
the
old
carriage
house
where
the
car
stood
he
was
only
a
minute
in
getting
under
way
for
he
had
learned
to
leave
his
machine
in
a
condition
in
which
it
could
be
used
the
next
time
without
waiting
to
fill
gasoline
tanks
or
radiators
it
was
natural
for
him
to
go
at
things
in
a
systematic
way
and
he
kept
his
car
as
he
kept
his
books
and
papers
in
order
quite
without
thinking
much
about
it
but
with
all
his
haste
sally
had
reached
the
driveway
and
gone
a
rod
or
two
down
the
road
before
he
overtook
her
he
slowed
down
at
her
side
why
did
you
wait
jump
in
said
he
and
i
have
you
there
in
one
burst
of
speed
sally
stepped
up
on
the
running
board
and
stood
there
her
arm
on
the
back
of
the
roadster
seat
get
clear
in
please
requested
jarvis
there
be
no
bursts
of
speed
with
you
standing
there
i
can
hold
on
perfectly
well
so
can
the
car
stand
still
it
will
stand
still
till
you
get
in
sally
took
the
seat
now
hurry
up
please
said
she
there
is
any
use
in
my
getting
in
at
all
just
for
a
foot
or
two
of
ride
the
car
moved
off
let
make
it
longer
jarvis
urged
drive
out
with
me
for
the
fork
we
wo
be
half
an
hour
away
and
you
ca
have
anything
very
pressing
left
on
hand
with
all
the
work
you
girls
have
done
to
get
ready
for
those
youngsters
he
opened
his
throttle
as
he
spoke
and
the
car
responded
sally
shook
her
head
decidedly
no
no
i
not
going
i
told
jo
i
be
back
in
five
minutes
with
the
big
pail
hill
said
we
might
take
for
the
lemonade
they
wo
need
lemonade
for
two
hours
yet
come
on
i
want
company
slow
down
please
requested
sally
for
the
car
was
already
approaching
the
farm
house
which
was
her
destination
but
instead
of
slowing
down
jarvis
deliberately
increased
his
speed
i
in
the
habit
of
doing
most
things
you
ask
me
to
said
he
but
this
time
i
going
to
have
my
way
there
are
plenty
of
people
there
to
finish
it
all
this
morning
i
have
you
back
before
they
miss
you
and
the
car
shot
by
the
hill
farm
house
at
a
pace
which
supported
his
promise
sally
sat
back
silently
although
jarvis
went
on
talking
about
various
things
she
did
not
reply
and
her
silence
lasted
until
having
gone
a
mile
on
his
way
jarvis
slowed
down
a
little
and
turned
to
look
at
her
what
the
matter
he
asked
you
certainly
not
angry
with
me
for
running
away
with
you
she
nodded
looking
straight
ahead
this
was
not
like
sally
who
though
she
possessed
plenty
of
spirit
was
seldom
known
to
sulk
well
i
sorry
if
you
are
but
not
sorry
i
ran
away
with
you
you
can
talk
to
me
or
not
but
you
ca
get
away
i
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
have
time
to
take
you
back
so
i
can
keep
you
to
myself
for
one
straight
and
that
whether
you
know
it
or
not
more
than
i
had
for
a
month
six
weeks
two
months
this
declaration
unlocked
sally
lips
how
absurd
said
she
still
gazing
straight
ahead
it
may
be
absurd
but
it
true
you
may
not
have
noticed
it
but
true
just
the
same
i
do
know
whether
it
intentional
on
your
part
or
not
and
i
do
know
which
i
would
rather
have
it
that
you
meant
to
keep
away
or
that
you
have
noticed
that
you
have
i
think
he
added
judicially
that
not
knowing
that
you
have
would
be
much
the
worse
so
i
choose
to
think
you
meant
to
do
it
and
i
want
to
know
why
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
again
the
cheek
next
him
was
pink
and
momentarily
growing
pinker
sally
again
murmured
something
which
sounded
like
perfectly
absurd
but
jarvis
considered
that
no
answer
at
all
the
car
began
to
climb
a
long
grade
please
tell
me
he
urged
there
nothing
to
tell
said
the
girl
reluctantly
there
are
ever
so
many
of
us
now
and
we
naturally
all
together
or
some
of
us
are
together
and
some
of
us
are
we
just
a
lot
of
boys
and
girls
are
we
i
feel
rather
grown
up
myself
sally
spoke
quickly
i
not
or
at
least
i
do
want
to
be
i
want
to
stay
a
girl
a
little
girl
i
be
if
i
could
just
as
long
as
i
can
i
want
to
have
good
times
all
together
not
two
and
two
the
cheek
next
him
was
a
very
deep
pink
indeed
now
do
i
try
to
make
it
and
two
you
seem
to
and
you
do
want
me
to
no
if
i
happen
to
see
you
alone
in
the
garden
must
i
go
and
get
your
uncle
tim
or
my
mother
not
if
you
talk
sense
i
do
talk
sense
sally
did
not
answer
this
question
so
he
repeated
it
in
the
form
of
an
accepted
statement
so
i
do
talk
sense
this
certainly
called
loudly
for
an
explanation
and
sally
made
it
in
a
way
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean
i
know
what
mean
but
i
did
know
it
deserved
that
name
it
only
sally
hesitated
then
she
went
through
with
it
speaking
hurriedly
i
do
want
you
to
bother
about
me
doing
things
for
me
except
as
you
do
them
for
us
all
you
you
are
getting
well
what
am
i
getting
out
with
it
to
seem
not
like
my
old
friend
jarvis
burnside
and
i
rather
have
him
back
it
was
certainly
out
now
jarvis
drove
on
up
the
hill
steadily
without
any
further
questioning
it
was
precisely
like
sally
thus
bravely
to
have
shown
him
where
he
stood
it
was
a
position
clearly
defined
he
had
stood
on
it
so
long
that
he
ought
surely
to
be
able
easily
to
go
back
to
it
but
he
had
driven
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
on
for
two
miles
down
the
road
had
taken
the
turn
to
the
left
and
pursued
that
road
for
another
mile
so
that
he
was
nearly
at
his
destination
before
he
spoke
when
at
last
he
did
speak
it
was
only
to
say
very
quietly
and
cheerfully
at
least
so
it
sounded
all
right
sally
then
he
turned
in
at
an
open
gate
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
with
the
and
tackle
and
ropes
at
their
feet
he
was
turning
out
again
the
drive
back
was
rather
a
silent
one
jarvis
spoke
often
and
sally
replied
but
it
was
about
things
to
be
seen
along
the
wayside
or
of
the
plans
for
the
day
the
trip
was
made
rather
faster
than
it
had
been
done
in
coming
and
the
pace
was
excuse
enough
for
there
being
no
prolonged
conversation
on
any
subject
jarvis
was
now
an
expert
driver
and
by
no
means
an
one
though
he
took
no
risks
that
he
would
have
called
by
that
name
when
he
was
not
alone
more
than
once
his
passenger
held
her
breath
but
realized
afterward
that
she
had
been
in
no
real
danger
then
they
were
at
home
and
sally
was
saying
thank
you
very
much
as
she
jumped
out
quite
as
if
she
had
eagerly
requested
to
be
taken
you
are
entirely
welcome
was
his
response
in
such
an
odd
tone
that
she
looked
round
at
him
he
was
smiling
but
not
at
her
at
the
driveway
before
him
and
she
could
not
help
noting
that
he
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
crushed
by
anything
that
had
occurred
that
morning
it
struck
her
that
he
had
never
seemed
a
stronger
or
more
attractive
figure
than
he
looked
at
this
moment
sitting
at
the
wheel
with
the
bright
july
sunlight
touching
his
brown
cheek
and
profile
his
head
with
its
heavy
crop
of
dark
hair
bare
and
his
powerful
engine
throbbing
before
him
suddenly
she
wanted
to
say
you
do
mind
do
you
with
a
queer
little
feeling
that
he
did
mind
quite
enough
but
the
car
was
already
off
and
she
went
on
into
the
house
with
a
sense
of
not
feeling
quite
so
relieved
as
might
have
been
expected
at
having
brought
about
something
she
had
been
wishing
for
some
time
to
accomplish
but
known
just
how
but
she
had
no
time
left
in
which
to
do
any
thinking
about
her
own
affairs
as
was
easily
to
be
discerned
by
the
distant
shoutings
city
guests
had
arrived
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
hayfield
from
the
kitchen
window
they
could
be
seen
swarming
about
with
rakes
and
pitchforks
like
so
many
black
spiders
there
were
many
more
of
them
than
could
possibly
be
used
to
any
advantage
it
seemed
but
as
about
half
of
the
distant
figures
appeared
to
be
standing
on
their
heads
it
might
be
taken
for
granted
that
employment
of
some
sort
could
be
had
for
everybody
at
noon
the
four
girls
captured
jake
and
his
horses
filled
the
bottom
of
the
with
baskets
and
pails
and
were
borne
up
to
the
fields
where
they
were
hailed
with
cheers
under
a
tall
elm
at
one
side
of
the
scene
of
operations
they
spread
the
lunch
and
a
motley
crowd
was
presently
encamped
around
it
their
entertainers
thought
they
had
never
seen
a
happier
lot
of
youngsters
they
were
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
but
in
one
point
they
were
alike
their
ignorance
of
the
country
and
their
delight
in
this
interesting
and
novel
experience
they
were
very
plainly
all
devoted
friends
of
the
young
man
who
had
brought
them
there
as
could
be
seen
in
their
every
look
at
him
how
long
have
you
known
mr
ferry
josephine
asked
of
one
slim
tall
lad
with
black
hair
drooping
over
a
pair
of
sharp
black
eyes
his
pale
face
full
of
animation
oh
ever
since
he
come
down
our
street
one
day
an
axed
me
a
feller
i
knowed
that
jes
come
back
from
the
horspital
chap
got
run
over
mr
ferry
was
feared
he
would
have
no
home
to
stay
in
when
he
got
out
o
horspital
no
more
he
did
till
then
after
that
day
he
did
all
right
josephine
glanced
toward
the
subject
of
these
remarks
and
then
back
at
the
lad
who
nodded
bet
yer
life
was
him
fixed
it
he
declared
there
do
no
kid
go
without
some
kind
of
a
home
if
he
can
fix
things
for
you
boys
must
think
a
good
deal
of
him
suggested
josephine
the
boy
lips
answered
only
you
bet
but
his
face
instantly
became
eloquent
after
lunch
the
first
load
of
hay
was
pitched
upon
the
wagon
jarvis
jake
and
ferry
wielding
the
pitchforks
sally
driving
and
a
big
boy
at
the
bridle
of
the
colt
that
had
run
away
during
the
ploughing
season
and
so
could
not
be
trusted
entirely
to
sally
although
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
manage
him
without
help
he
was
not
exactly
a
colt
after
all
being
four
years
old
but
he
was
new
in
the
traces
of
the
and
jake
kept
an
eye
on
him
you
fellers
pitch
pretty
well
fer
green
hands
acknowledged
jake
when
the
load
was
nearly
on
he
was
on
the
wagon
with
sally
placing
the
forkfuls
as
they
were
pitched
on
expected
to
see
one
or
of
you
git
winded
and
go
set
down
under
the
ellum
the
third
load
git
you
though
i
the
two
contestants
exchanged
laughing
glances
under
the
forkfuls
at
the
moment
lifted
above
their
heads
this
fellow
a
hercules
for
muscle
said
jarvis
to
jake
but
i
discovered
several
places
in
my
anatomy
not
so
well
developed
as
they
might
be
i
going
to
get
after
them
right
away
and
train
them
up
to
the
standard
great
caesar
but
it
a
hot
day
he
stood
up
and
wiped
his
perspiring
brow
i
think
it
deliciously
cool
remarked
sally
from
the
top
of
the
load
it
perfectly
comfortable
here
called
janet
from
the
fence
near
by
where
the
other
three
girls
were
perched
jake
grinned
he
had
been
grinning
more
or
less
all
day
this
haying
it
with
a
field
full
of
boys
and
young
ladies
was
a
new
and
interesting
experience
for
kelly
at
this
moment
a
diversion
arose
two
of
the
guests
disputing
for
the
possession
of
a
pitchfork
both
naturally
preferring
it
to
a
rake
for
bunching
up
from
the
winrows
being
raked
by
bob
with
a
had
decided
to
settle
the
matter
street
fashion
with
their
fists
they
were
pretty
evenly
matched
and
a
fight
ensued
ferry
stopped
to
watch
the
bout
and
see
that
fair
play
was
enforced
everybody
else
stopped
work
also
and
stood
looking
that
way
jake
kelly
perhaps
the
most
interested
spectator
in
the
field
slid
down
from
the
load
and
strolled
toward
the
affair
still
grinning
jarvis
with
the
precaution
of
a
glance
around
at
the
wagon
on
the
top
of
which
perched
sally
took
a
few
steps
in
the
same
direction
it
was
hot
and
he
was
glad
of
a
moment
respite
from
his
labours
he
did
not
see
that
the
lad
at
the
bridle
of
the
colt
had
relaxed
his
hold
suddenly
one
of
the
lads
in
the
affair
of
the
pitchfork
got
in
a
bit
of
unfair
work
unfair
according
to
the
standards
ferry
had
introduced
among
these
young
friends
of
his
a
protesting
yell
from
at
least
a
dozen
throats
instantly
called
the
fighters
attention
to
this
fact
and
ferry
himself
called
out
no
fouls
bates
at
the
yells
the
colt
plunged
carrying
his
mate
with
him
sally
though
unprepared
hung
on
gallantly
to
the
lines
trying
hard
to
pull
the
pair
to
a
standstill
the
ground
was
uneven
and
not
free
from
an
occasional
stone
the
wagon
had
not
gone
its
own
length
before
a
shriek
from
the
girls
on
the
fence
had
brought
jarvis
jake
and
ferry
to
the
and
all
three
rushed
for
the
horses
heads
but
they
were
too
late
to
prevent
the
accident
which
is
always
liable
to
happen
in
a
hayfield
particularly
when
the
driver
is
a
novice
the
right
front
wheel
swerved
into
a
hollow
the
wagon
tipped
the
colt
plunged
again
sally
slipped
and
tried
to
throw
herself
down
in
safety
upon
the
top
of
the
load
but
it
slid
with
her
and
in
an
instant
the
spectators
and
the
three
dashing
to
the
rescue
saw
the
whole
load
go
like
a
green
mountain
to
the
ground
covering
sally
from
sight
now
a
forkful
of
hay
is
light
but
a
load
of
the
fragrant
stuff
is
very
heavy
and
very
smothery
and
it
depends
entirely
upon
where
the
victim
lands
under
such
an
avalanche
whether
the
matter
is
serious
or
otherwise
for
a
minute
nobody
could
be
sure
just
where
the
slender
figure
might
be
for
it
made
no
outcry
the
hearts
of
them
all
were
in
their
throats
for
a
minute
as
the
men
tore
at
the
hay
with
their
hands
jarvis
thundering
at
the
tall
lad
who
seized
upon
a
pitchfork
touch
it
with
that
you
fool
he
was
blaming
himself
savagely
as
he
worked
for
leaving
the
girl
for
an
instant
under
such
conditions
ferry
was
calling
do
be
frightened
we
have
you
out
in
a
minute
jake
was
grunting
hope
the
little
gal
ai
far
under
hope
to
mercy
she
ai
and
josephine
janet
and
constance
were
trying
to
get
a
chance
to
help
though
the
most
they
could
do
was
to
keep
clear
of
the
desperately
working
arms
of
the
men
it
was
jarvis
who
with
a
hoarse
ejaculation
of
thankfulness
came
first
upon
a
fold
of
the
blue
skirt
sally
had
not
been
under
the
heaviest
part
of
the
load
and
doubtless
it
was
only
the
smother
of
the
hay
which
kept
her
from
calling
out
if
the
fall
itself
had
not
hurt
her
in
a
minute
more
they
had
her
out
very
red
and
choky
her
eyes
blinded
with
dust
her
curls
full
of
and
she
was
lying
on
a
soft
mound
of
the
fragrant
stuff
the
girls
fanning
her
ferry
bringing
her
lemonade
from
the
pail
and
jarvis
watching
her
with
his
heart
in
his
eyes
only
fortunately
considering
the
conversation
of
the
morning
her
own
eyes
were
too
full
of
sticks
to
see
you
not
hurt
anywhere
dear
one
or
other
of
the
girls
asked
her
at
close
intervals
and
sally
shook
her
head
each
time
until
at
length
she
was
able
to
clear
her
throat
enough
to
murmur
only
my
feelings
as
jake
said
it
was
so
silly
of
me
it
was
much
worse
than
silly
of
us
vowed
donald
ferry
his
fine
freckled
face
a
deep
with
heat
and
anxiety
his
breath
still
a
trifle
laboured
with
the
furious
exertion
of
the
rescue
but
in
a
very
short
time
she
was
all
right
again
and
sitting
up
on
her
hay
throne
watching
the
wrecked
load
being
pitched
back
upon
the
wagon
the
horses
had
not
escaped
for
a
dozen
boys
had
set
after
them
headed
by
the
tall
youth
and
the
and
had
proved
themselves
decidedly
more
efficient
at
stopping
runaways
than
at
making
symmetrical
if
you
have
any
regard
for
my
pride
said
sally
suddenly
when
the
load
was
half
replaced
you
let
me
drive
down
to
the
barn
the
three
men
stopped
and
looked
at
her
that
mighty
plucky
of
you
miss
sally
declared
donald
ferry
but
if
you
have
any
regard
for
feelings
and
he
let
an
eloquent
shake
of
the
head
finish
his
sentence
for
him
jarvis
said
nothing
but
a
certain
peculiar
set
of
his
jaw
as
he
went
on
with
his
pitching
spoke
volumes
as
for
jake
kelly
wall
i
want
to
know
said
he
then
he
laughed
outright
i
miss
said
he
ef
you
ride
on
that
load
o
hay
again
it
be
because
them
two
rendered
incompetent
o
action
an
they
do
look
to
me
much
paralysis
would
set
in
yit
awhile
chapter
xv
on
an
august
evening
oh
dear
who
this
coming
just
as
we
settled
down
to
accomplish
something
it
the
chases
girls
we
simply
ca
stop
work
to
entertain
them
we
do
need
to
stop
this
sort
of
work
they
bent
over
their
sewing
all
but
sally
who
with
inward
reluctance
got
to
her
feet
as
the
chases
big
car
rolled
up
the
driveway
and
approached
the
porch
where
the
four
girls
were
sitting
busy
with
some
extremely
important
matters
but
of
course
the
work
had
to
be
put
down
for
a
little
when
dorothy
chase
actually
set
foot
on
the
porch
oh
what
an
energetic
crowd
she
cried
this
hot
august
morning
too
sally
where
are
your
men
neil
wants
to
see
some
of
them
while
i
talk
to
you
sally
pointed
off
into
the
distance
jarvis
and
bob
are
hoeing
potatoes
over
there
in
the
field
there
a
tree
near
by
and
neil
can
sit
in
the
shade
of
that
you
do
mind
going
neil
they
behind
with
the
potatoes
neil
chase
bowed
impressively
to
the
group
on
the
porch
i
should
much
prefer
to
stay
here
said
he
gallantly
but
business
reasons
impel
me
to
seek
that
inferno
out
yonder
what
jarve
finds
interesting
in
that
sort
of
thing
is
beyond
me
he
drove
on
by
the
house
and
over
the
grass
behind
getting
as
near
to
the
as
possible
that
he
might
have
to
walk
only
the
least
necessary
distance
meanwhile
his
wife
sat
down
and
inspected
the
quality
of
the
work
being
done
on
the
porch
are
you
people
sewing
for
an
orphan
asylum
she
inquired
after
discovering
that
red
and
blue
ginghams
and
white
cotton
cloth
of
a
grade
only
moderately
fine
were
the
materials
being
used
for
certain
small
garments
something
like
it
one
of
mr
ferry
poor
families
was
burned
out
the
other
day
five
children
and
an
invalid
mother
of
course
the
mother
always
an
invalid
is
she
i
believe
they
make
themselves
invalids
on
purpose
well
it
makes
no
difference
how
important
it
is
those
children
wo
freeze
in
this
weather
if
you
do
get
these
things
all
done
and
i
in
a
perfectly
awful
difficulty
you
all
have
simply
got
to
help
me
out
what
the
matter
josephine
asked
the
question
calmly
being
used
to
dorothy
chase
fashion
of
putting
things
she
threaded
her
needle
as
she
spoke
as
if
she
had
every
intention
of
continuing
to
work
for
as
long
a
period
as
she
had
planned
to
do
the
other
girls
resumed
their
sewing
also
the
cause
of
their
being
at
work
at
all
certainly
was
apology
sufficient
for
going
on
with
it
in
spite
of
the
visitor
just
listen
and
nobody
is
to
say
a
word
till
i
through
it
no
use
raising
objections
you
to
do
as
i
ask
if
you
care
anything
whatever
about
my
friendship
she
grasped
the
ends
of
the
parasol
lying
on
her
lap
nodded
her
head
violently
causing
several
lavender
plumes
to
nutter
agitatedly
upon
her
hat
and
plunged
into
her
subject
i
entertaining
for
our
new
bishop
and
he
a
distant
connection
besides
i
made
it
an
evening
affair
because
it
so
hot
and
our
new
house
opens
up
so
beautifully
i
planned
to
have
some
informal
music
and
at
this
last
minute
herr
braun
and
madame
hafsky
have
failed
me
it
was
a
misunderstanding
about
the
date
it
turns
out
they
were
engaged
for
weeks
ago
by
somebody
very
important
they
wo
give
it
up
i
must
have
music
and
everybody
is
out
of
town
now
what
i
want
is
to
have
you
four
go
back
with
me
to
luncheon
help
me
about
the
decorations
and
things
this
afternoon
and
then
have
miss
carew
sing
and
miss
ferry
play
for
us
in
the
evening
neil
will
come
back
for
the
men
for
the
evening
you
know
i
did
ask
you
in
the
beginning
only
because
i
knew
you
did
want
to
be
invited
but
now
you
come
it
was
precisely
like
dorothy
chase
that
was
all
that
could
be
said
nobody
said
it
but
sally
and
josephine
thought
it
and
janet
and
constance
told
themselves
as
they
sewed
on
that
the
young
matron
who
made
this
decidedly
startling
proposition
must
be
accustomed
to
having
things
her
own
way
or
she
would
not
have
acquired
so
confident
a
manner
of
making
her
demands
sally
was
the
first
to
give
voice
to
her
astonishment
well
dorothy
said
she
you
certainly
take
us
off
our
feet
here
are
we
just
settled
down
to
work
that
absolutely
must
be
done
and
in
you
walk
and
ask
us
to
lay
it
down
and
go
off
to
help
entertain
a
bishop
who
probably
wishing
you
would
do
anything
special
at
all
for
him
this
hot
weather
nothing
of
the
sort
he
heard
all
about
miss
carew
voice
people
that
met
her
last
year
in
leipsic
constance
sat
up
who
please
the
markhams
and
the
carrolls
now
will
you
be
good
constance
leaned
back
again
applying
herself
to
her
sewing
i
do
remember
anybody
of
that
name
mused
janet
looking
at
constance
yes
you
do
friends
of
sears
just
stopping
over
a
day
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
met
there
must
have
been
something
in
constance
invisible
to
other
beholders
which
recalled
some
incident
or
other
to
janet
for
after
staring
a
minute
she
suddenly
dropped
her
eyes
said
oh
yes
and
sewed
away
faster
than
ever
will
you
come
demanded
dorothy
chase
they
tried
to
get
out
of
it
they
pointed
out
various
reasons
why
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
come
away
dorothy
overrode
all
their
objections
and
became
so
persistent
that
at
last
the
four
agreed
but
refused
to
go
until
evening
as
for
the
young
men
of
the
household
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
ask
them
send
out
for
us
just
in
time
for
your
affair
and
we
come
promised
sally
but
what
you
want
of
jo
and
me
i
do
see
we
ca
perform
for
you
in
any
way
oh
but
you
can
help
make
things
go
sally
can
talk
to
the
bishop
i
ca
cried
sally
dismayed
and
jo
can
be
nice
to
bishop
i
do
see
why
your
men
come
it
so
hard
to
get
men
for
anything
except
sports
in
summer
how
perfectly
absurd
it
is
for
jarvis
burnside
to
prefer
hoeing
potatoes
in
this
frightful
sun
to
playing
society
man
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
evening
it
truly
incomprehensible
but
so
it
is
besides
he
looks
like
an
indian
and
in
his
evening
clothes
would
resemble
a
fiend
be
satisfied
dorothy
now
you
have
us
for
victims
and
let
the
men
stay
at
home
and
sally
slashed
a
seam
open
with
shears
that
clipped
like
her
speech
but
chase
was
not
satisfied
and
berated
jarvis
roundly
when
presently
he
came
walking
up
to
the
porch
with
neil
looking
the
picture
of
contentment
he
took
her
displeasure
lightly
enough
and
presently
had
her
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
well
i
know
all
about
it
now
neil
chase
informed
the
company
as
he
got
into
his
car
we
ploughed
seven
acres
and
sowed
it
to
buckwheat
turned
the
buckwheat
under
and
have
now
planted
the
ground
to
potatoes
in
the
end
there
are
to
be
strawberries
on
the
seven
acres
or
a
good
share
of
it
and
burnside
lane
are
to
become
the
most
successful
strawberry
culturists
in
this
part
of
the
country
right
you
are
agreed
jarvis
placidly
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
and
poking
about
in
janet
ferry
until
he
found
a
thimble
which
he
placed
on
the
only
finger
it
would
fit
the
smallest
one
on
his
right
hand
he
had
washed
the
hands
before
he
came
to
the
porch
but
they
were
so
brown
that
the
little
gold
thimble
looked
most
absurd
in
its
new
position
if
i
sew
for
you
for
an
hour
miss
janet
he
proposed
as
the
car
bolted
away
down
the
drive
will
you
come
and
hoe
potatoes
for
me
until
lunch
time
i
would
gladly
hoe
potatoes
all
day
if
i
could
be
let
off
from
going
to
play
for
chase
friends
this
evening
the
fierce
energy
with
which
janet
pulled
out
a
row
of
bastings
gave
emphasis
to
her
words
jarvis
looked
at
his
sister
how
did
you
manage
not
to
let
me
in
for
this
affair
sis
i
knew
you
would
go
and
janet
knew
her
brother
would
sally
said
max
would
be
too
used
up
happy
boys
we
saved
you
from
it
at
the
price
of
going
ourselves
girls
we
have
to
make
it
up
to
you
somehow
when
i
see
ferry
i
hold
on
i
an
idea
how
are
you
coming
home
in
neil
car
as
we
go
we
see
that
you
come
in
a
better
way
be
good
little
girls
do
your
stunts
keep
up
your
courage
and
we
rescue
you
promptly
at
eleven
and
putting
down
the
thimble
jarvis
went
away
deaf
to
entreaties
to
tell
what
his
interesting
plan
might
be
oh
dear
is
it
horrid
demanded
sally
that
evening
running
into
josephine
room
in
the
course
of
her
dressing
to
have
certain
unreachable
hooks
and
eyes
fastened
after
sewing
all
day
we
deserve
something
better
than
one
of
the
chases
fussy
affairs
stop
fuming
and
stand
still
anybody
who
looks
as
pretty
as
you
do
in
this
white
swiss
poor
old
white
swiss
the
same
one
i
wish
dorothy
could
forget
the
pattern
of
it
she
undoubtedly
mention
that
i
wore
it
at
her
wedding
she
does
every
time
do
you
care
a
bit
those
touches
of
blue
make
it
seem
perfectly
fresh
to
me
and
i
seen
it
much
oftener
than
dorothy
chase
has
you
a
comfort
you
look
like
a
dream
yourself
in
that
thing
a
midsummer
day
dream
then
with
my
gypsy
skin
oh
there
neil
and
his
car
a
nice
lot
you
are
neil
chase
was
exclaiming
outside
as
he
drove
up
to
the
porch
and
eyed
the
male
figures
occupying
its
comfortable
recesses
max
reposed
in
a
hammock
timothy
rudd
swayed
to
and
fro
in
a
rocker
reading
the
evening
paper
by
the
sunset
light
alec
and
bob
sitting
on
the
steps
were
playing
a
game
of
some
sort
and
jarvis
lay
stretched
at
full
length
on
a
rug
his
arms
beneath
his
head
luxuriously
resting
after
his
bath
and
change
of
work
clothes
for
fresh
flannels
enjoying
the
sense
of
virtue
earned
by
having
hoed
many
rows
of
potatoes
with
a
vigorous
arm
a
nice
lot
neil
went
on
we
have
it
in
for
you
particularly
jarve
max
never
was
much
of
a
society
chap
but
you
once
could
be
depended
upon
to
do
your
duty
like
a
man
bob
run
in
and
see
if
those
girls
are
ready
dorothy
wo
be
easy
till
she
sees
them
one
thing
i
know
you
soon
tire
of
this
playing
at
farming
to
be
the
real
thing
you
fellows
ought
to
work
till
the
sun
goes
down
doing
i
wager
a
fiver
you
come
in
and
get
your
bath
every
night
before
dinner
eh

jarvis
laughed
and
you
do
sit
down
in
your
well
hardly
you
not
the
real
thing
never
will
be
look
at
those
girls
he
pulled
off
his
straw
hat
as
two
figures
appeared
in
the
doorway
nice
farmers
folks
they
are
we
glad
you
think
we
nice
responded
sally
gathering
her
white
skirts
about
her
jo
be
careful
do
get
that
frill
against
the
running
board
jarvis
reposeful
posture
had
become
an
active
one
and
he
took
care
that
neither
skirts
nor
white
ones
fluttered
against
anything
on
the
outside
of
the
car
that
might
soil
them
here
come
constance
and
janet
are
they
imposing
society
ladies
now
and
sally
stood
up
to
wave
at
the
two
coming
through
the
hedge
accompanied
by
janet
brother
ferry
had
an
eye
upon
the
porch
and
meant
to
spend
the
evening
consoling
his
friends
for
the
absence
of
the
usual
feminine
contingent
you
exquisite
person
may
i
venture
to
sit
beside
you
whispered
sally
as
constance
in
trailing
pale
gray
with
bands
of
violet
velvet
a
shimmering
cloak
of
the
same
hues
enveloping
her
like
a
mist
took
the
place
beside
her
this
is
the
singer
not
my
friend
constance
i
just
a
little
afraid
of
you
nonsense
constance
warm
hand
caught
sally
beneath
the
cloak
you
know
i
do
like
show
singing
or
anything
that
goes
with
it
do
forget
your
promise
josephine
called
back
as
the
big
car
with
its
load
rolled
away
an
answering
shout
from
the
porch
accompanied
by
the
waving
of
several
arms
conveyed
assurance
what
promise
asked
janet
turning
to
the
others
being
the
smallest
of
the
party
she
occupied
one
of
the
folding
seats
which
enable
a
roomy
tonneau
to
hold
five
people
the
boys
are
coming
after
us
we
do
know
how
does
that
give
you
courage
to
face
the
evening
murmured
josephine
and
the
expression
on
janet
face
became
decidedly
more
hopeful
but
how
can
they
come
they
only
your
brother
car
she
said
in
josephine
ear
do
know
and
do
care
they
come
and
rescue
us
from
our
fate
they
felt
during
the
following
hours
that
they
needed
the
cheering
prospect
of
a
merry
to
enable
them
to
bear
the
rigours
of
the
form
of
entertainment
offered
them
it
was
not
that
the
affair
differed
much
from
affairs
of
its
sort
but
the
fact
that
it
did
not
materially
differ
might
have
been
what
made
it
seem
so
tiresome
possibly
the
effect
of
a
summer
of
home
merrymaking
under
the
least
conventional
of
conditions
had
been
to
make
formal
entertaining
under
a
roof
seem
more
than
ordinarily
fatiguing
and
pointless
the
handsome
rooms
were
hot
in
spite
of
open
windows
the
guests
quite
evidently
were
making
heroic
efforts
to
seem
gay
somehow
even
janet
brilliant
music
stirred
only
a
perfunctory
sort
of
applause
never
played
so
badly
in
my
life
whispered
the
performer
when
she
regained
josephine
side
after
her
second
number
you
played
perfectly
as
you
always
do
i
played
like
an
automaton
a
do
pretend
you
know
the
difference
i
understand
of
course
but
you
know
we
should
really
like
to
have
you
play
for
the
bishop
and
these
people
as
you
do
for
us
on
your
own
piano
the
poor
bishop
does
he
look
like
a
martyr
i
sure
delightful
in
his
own
library
or
at
his
friends
but
he
hates
this
sort
of
thing
he
beautifully
polite
but
he
bored
my
only
hope
is
that
con
will
revive
him
it
her
turn
next
if
anything
could
revive
a
weary
bishop
who
had
that
day
attended
two
funerals
and
a
diocesan
convention
it
would
be
both
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
miss
constance
carew
is
she
breathed
sally
in
josephine
ear
as
constance
took
her
place
her
slender
figure
and
face
a
notable
contrast
to
the
personality
of
the
professional
singer
who
had
opened
the
program
of
occasional
numbers
interspersed
through
an
evening
of
conversation
sally
hands
were
unconsciously
clasped
tight
all
through
the
song
and
her
eyes
left
the
singer
face
only
long
enough
to
observe
that
the
bishop
tired
eyes
were
also
fixed
upon
the
creator
of
all
those
wonderful
liquid
notes
and
to
fancy
that
for
the
moment
at
least
he
forgot
how
hot
his
neck
was
inside
his
close
clerical
neckwear
that
pays
me
for
coming
was
the
reward
constance
had
from
sally
whose
praise
she
had
somehow
come
to
value
more
highly
than
that
of
most
people
she
knew
sally
might
be
no
musician
herself
but
she
was
a
most
sympathetic
listener
and
could
appreciate
the
points
singers
love
to
have
appreciated
as
few
people
can
that
pays
me
constance
answered
drawing
a
long
breath
but
sally
will
it
never
end
it
nearly
eleven
now
thank
heaven
i
lost
all
count
of
time
the
boys
said
they
be
here
at
eleven
but
dorothy
is
not
to
know
they
within
five
miles
of
here
she
never
forgive
them
as
she
spoke
a
maid
came
to
her
elbow
and
handed
her
a
note
retiring
to
a
secluded
corner
to
read
it
sally
returned
with
triumphant
eyes
to
go
down
the
lawn
to
a
gate
that
opens
on
the
other
road
there
now
to
get
away
from
dorothy
this
proved
difficult
not
let
neil
take
you
back
why
not
how
will
you
get
back
but
not
going
yet
both
the
girls
have
performed
twice
with
two
encores
you
do
expect
any
more
of
them
this
hot
night
your
bishop
is
going
to
sleep
do
let
him
off
and
send
him
to
bed
yes
we
must
go
now
they
sent
for
us
do
bother
about
how
we
going
to
get
back
neil
will
be
thankful
not
to
have
to
take
us
thus
sally
and
when
dorothy
persisted
in
exclamations
and
questions
her
guests
fell
into
a
little
gusto
of
enthusiasm
over
the
stately
old
house
which
neil
had
bought
after
he
had
to
give
up
the
maxwell
lane
place
and
diverted
dorothy
attention
sally
also
praised
everything
she
could
honestly
praise
in
relation
to
the
affair
of
the
evening
and
not
a
thing
she
could
for
sally
was
the
most
honest
creature
alive
somehow
at
last
she
got
her
party
away
from
their
hostess
taking
advantage
of
the
bishop
approach
to
whisper
hastily
here
comes
your
guest
of
honour
now
do
attend
to
him
and
forget
us
and
so
had
them
all
out
a
side
door
and
off
down
the
lawn
out
of
range
of
the
lighted
windows
as
they
hurried
along
in
their
airy
dresses
they
were
pulling
off
long
hot
gloves
and
saying
still
under
their
breath
oh
is
it
good
to
get
out
they
were
laughing
softly
and
breathing
deep
breaths
of
the
warm
summer
air
and
looking
up
at
the
starlit
sky
now
where
is
that
gate
they
had
reached
the
high
fence
at
the
back
of
the
grounds
here
you
are
this
way
came
back
a
low
voice
and
a
doorway
in
the
fence
swung
open
there
was
a
rush
of
skirts
and
the
four
were
out
in
the
road
at
the
back
of
the
suburban
place
a
country
road
on
which
stood
most
appropriately
a
long
cushioned
with
hay
and
rugs
drawn
by
a
pair
of
farm
horses
with
jake
kelly
in
command
four
other
dark
figures
were
grouped
about
the
back
end
you
splendid
things
what
a
jolly
idea
oh
what
a
delicious
change
from
a
hot
here
mother
burnside
tucked
away
in
the
corner
how
good
of
you
to
come
you
patient
person
now
tell
us
all
about
it
demanded
donald
ferry
of
sally
next
whom
at
the
end
of
the
load
he
sat
it
may
be
noted
that
jarvis
had
not
been
found
of
late
at
sally
elbow
without
a
suggestion
of
seeming
avoidance
on
her
part
or
of
umbrage
on
his
the
two
no
longer
fell
to
each
other
as
a
matter
of
course
sally
plea
had
had
the
effect
she
wished
for
both
constance
and
janet
appeared
to
like
jarvis
immensely
and
sally
could
not
detect
any
failure
on
his
part
to
enjoy
their
society
she
told
herself
it
was
a
very
good
thing
that
she
had
been
so
frank
with
him
all
about
it
she
was
answering
ferry
question
why
i
do
need
to
tell
you
you
know
without
having
been
there
exactly
how
things
went
more
or
less
probably
was
it
very
hot
stifling
how
could
it
be
anything
else
on
an
august
night
janet
vows
her
fingers
burned
on
the
keys
but
she
played
beautifully
of
course
and
the
bishop
had
a
little
interval
of
being
glad
he
was
there
poor
man
i
wonder
if
anything
can
be
warmer
than
a
clerical
waistcoat
nothing
except
a
clerical
collar
i
believe
did
constance
have
a
bad
time
of
it
too
she
does
like
singing
in
hot
rooms
she
sang
like
an
angel
the
bishop
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
at
her
all
through
and
applauded
so
vigorously
it
must
have
made
him
several
degrees
warmer
but
she
deserved
it
i
do
doubt
it
and
what
did
you
and
miss
josephine
do
stood
about
and
tried
to
look
pleased
and
happy
my
gloves
felt
like
furs
and
a
soapstone
and
i
could
think
of
anything
intelligent
to
say
to
anybody
ferry
laughed
i
wonder
if
anybody
ever
does
say
anything
intelligent
at
such
entertainments
did
neil
chase
himself
rise
to
the
occasion
and
play
the
genial
host
as
he
should
i
think
he
mostly
spent
the
evening
sitting
on
the
porch
rail
at
the
farthest
corner
away
from
the
the
memory
of
the
fellows
lounging
comfortably
on
your
porch
undoubtedly
made
his
role
seem
the
harder
by
contrast
i
saw
a
longing
look
in
his
eye
as
he
drove
away
and
had
an
idea
he
might
be
back
but
i
suppose
he
could
get
out
of
it
no
their
home
is
much
like
our
home
oh
this
air
delicious
do
you
suppose
constance
would
be
willing
to
sing
in
it
would
it
sound
like
a
part
of
the
summer
night
out
here
they
were
bowling
along
the
quiet
country
road
only
the
chirp
of
many
locusts
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
and
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
to
break
the
stillness
ferry
leaned
forward
constance
was
at
the
farther
end
of
the
wagon
between
jarvis
and
max
constance
he
called
softly
sally
thought
she
would
not
hear
but
she
did
ferry
voice
even
in
its
subdued
tones
possessed
that
carrying
quality
which
is
the
peculiar
acquirement
of
the
trained
public
speaker
yes
don
she
called
back
and
everybody
stopped
talking
people
had
a
way
of
stopping
other
talk
to
listen
when
either
of
these
two
had
anything
to
say
here
a
person
at
this
end
of
the
chariot
who
wonders
if
people
with
voices
ever
venture
to
test
them
in
the
open
air
what
do
you
think
about
it
that
one
of
them
will
if
we
ask
her
therefore
we
ask
constance
considered
an
instant
will
you
and
janet
sing
with
me
especially
for
sally
for
answer
ferry
tried
for
the
proper
key
found
it
under
his
breath
and
began
very
softly
and
on
a
low
note
to
sing
janet
joined
him
with
a
subdued
contralto
and
the
two
voices
without
words
made
themselves
into
a
harmonious
undertone
of
an
accompaniment
upon
this
support
presently
rose
constance
pure
notes
it
was
no
show
singing
this
time
and
the
song
did
not
lift
above
a
gentle
volume
which
seemed
to
fit
as
sally
had
anticipated
into
the
night
but
the
listeners
gave
themselves
to
the
listening
as
they
had
never
done
before
even
in
the
many
times
they
had
heard
this
girl
even
jake
kelly
on
his
driver
seat
turned
about
to
hearken
with
held
breath
the
drew
his
horses
down
to
a
walk
that
not
a
note
might
be
marred
a
garden
is
a
lovesome
thing
god
wot
rose
plot
fringed
pool
ferned
grot
the
veriest
school
of
peace
and
yet
the
fool
contends
that
god
is
not
not
god
in
gardens
when
the
eve
is
cool
nay
but
i
have
a
sign
very
sure
god
walks
in
mine
the
words
a
were
familiar
to
some
of
them
the
music
new
together
words
and
music
were
something
to
remember
footnote
a
the
words
are
those
of
thomas
edward
brown
certain
of
these
phrases
came
in
over
and
over
throughout
the
song
taking
hold
of
one
heart
most
appealingly
god
in
gardens
when
the
eve
is
came
again
and
again
till
one
felt
it
indeed
to
be
the
word
of
the
fool
then
in
exquisite
harmony
fell
the
assurance
but
i
have
a
sign
a
sign
a
sign
is
very
sure
god
walks
in
everybody
but
sally
found
words
in
which
to
tell
in
some
sort
how
the
song
had
seemed
to
them
even
alec
observing
boyishly
i
say
but
great
i
did
know
you
folks
could
all
sing
after
some
minutes
had
gone
by
donald
ferry
bent
to
speak
in
ear
she
was
looking
off
into
the
night
her
hands
clasped
tight
together
in
her
lap
i
know
he
said
very
gently
you
always
know
she
answered
under
cover
of
the
talk
which
was
now
going
on
again
tell
me
wistfully
do
you
think
he
walks
in
mine
i
know
it
he
walks
in
every
garden
when
he
is
wanted
there
chapter
xvi
if
ever
i
felt
weepy
over
seeing
people
off
it
this
minute
we
feel
just
as
weepy
over
going
sally
lunn
but
cheer
up
we
shall
come
out
every
other
minute
jarvis
and
i
and
mother
will
be
planning
all
winter
i
know
how
early
she
can
get
back
in
the
spring
josephine
gave
sally
a
tremendous
hug
as
she
spoke
and
burnside
in
her
turn
took
the
girl
into
her
motherly
embrace
i
should
have
believed
she
said
warmly
how
reluctant
i
should
be
to
go
back
to
town
in
the
fall
after
this
charming
summer
nor
how
willing
i
should
be
to
promise
to
return
in
the
spring
sally
dear
do
make
use
of
our
rooms
all
you
care
to
though
they
not
half
as
cheery
as
your
own
for
the
winter
it
been
a
lovely
summer
has
it
cried
sally
as
the
burnside
carriage
fine
bay
horses
and
liveried
coachman
appeared
upon
the
driveway
looking
suggestively
like
city
life
again
a
successful
one
too
do
you
think
for
the
boys
they
confident
they
have
improved
the
ground
so
much
that
their
first
real
crops
next
begin
to
show
what
crops
ought
to
be
yes
it
has
all
been
a
success
agreed
burnside
in
spite
of
the
mistakes
they
own
to
and
laugh
over
jarvis
himself
has
received
a
world
of
good
from
his
life
i
hoping
that
all
your
brothers
will
make
the
most
of
next
season
especially
max
oh
max
will
come
round
in
time
declared
josephine
confidently
i
caught
him
feeling
enviously
of
jarvis
arms
the
other
day
when
jarvis
said
he
felt
like
a
giant
max
said
he
thought
he
have
to
begin
giant
culture
whether
he
succeeded
in
making
any
squashes
grow
or
not
this
thought
cheered
sally
through
the
trying
moment
of
watching
her
friends
drive
away
their
going
took
place
at
rather
an
unfortunate
time
for
her
uncle
timothy
was
off
on
a
visit
to
his
old
new
hampshire
home
constance
carew
had
departed
the
week
before
though
under
promise
to
return
for
a
long
visit
the
following
summer
and
janet
was
away
for
a
wedding
in
which
she
was
to
play
the
part
of
bridesmaid
sally
one
consolation
was
that
joanna
was
to
take
the
place
of
mary
ann
flinders
in
the
kitchen
this
arrangement
had
been
made
by
burnside
on
just
what
terms
it
had
been
effected
sally
was
not
permitted
to
inquire
she
had
protested
against
it
but
the
argument
had
ended
by
the
elder
woman
saying
gently
sally
dear
i
shall
spend
a
happier
winter
if
i
know
you
have
my
good
joanna
here
she
likes
the
place
it
is
a
pleasant
change
for
her
from
the
responsibilities
of
my
entertaining
and
her
sister
is
eager
to
take
her
place
with
me
so
let
me
have
my
way
at
least
for
this
winter
it
was
a
way
of
putting
the
matter
which
could
not
be
set
aside
when
the
carriage
had
disappeared
sally
wandered
out
to
the
kitchen
to
console
herself
with
the
sight
of
joanna
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
presence
of
that
capable
comfortable
person
possessed
as
she
was
of
intelligence
and
common
sense
would
be
a
real
support
to
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
but
at
this
moment
even
joanna
failed
her
for
she
had
gone
to
her
room
the
hour
being
that
of
sally
wandered
back
again
into
the
feeling
too
disconsolate
even
to
make
the
effort
to
cheer
herself
by
going
for
a
brisk
walk
in
the
keen
late
october
air
a
measure
which
usually
had
a
prompt
effect
upon
her
spirits
from
the
window
she
saw
a
messenger
boy
approaching
and
hurried
to
the
porch
door
to
meet
him
hoping
he
brought
no
ill
news
two
minutes
later
she
was
reading
the
message
alone
in
the
while
the
boy
waited
in
the
hall
its
purport
banished
all
thought
of
present
circumstances
except
to
bring
the
wish
that
it
had
arrived
a
earlier
rudd
seriously
ill
anxious
to
have
you
come
at
once
it
read
and
was
signed
by
the
name
of
one
of
rudd
old
new
hampshire
friends
after
a
minute
deliberation
sally
wrote
her
reply
will
come
at
once
leave
if
possible
and
sent
the
boy
off
with
it
as
he
departed
jarvis
came
into
the
hall
from
the
door
at
the
rear
sally
turned
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
relief
oh
i
thought
you
had
gone
without
saying
you
ought
to
know
better
but
i
have
been
off
when
the
others
went
if
i
had
had
some
unexpected
magneto
trouble
all
right
now
and
i
going
at
once
what
that
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
yellow
envelope
in
her
hand
no
bad
news
i
hope
uncle
timmy
very
sick
up
in
new
hampshire
i
going
to
him
as
fast
as
i
can
get
off
uncle
timmy
oh
i
mighty
sorry
you
going
you
say
of
course
he
asked
me
to
come
i
was
just
going
to
telephone
to
find
out
about
trains
i
see
to
all
that
if
you
must
go
but
sally
have
you
let
max
know
not
yet
have
you
sent
an
answer
saying
you
will
come
on
your
own
responsibility
sally
slight
figure
drew
itself
up
why
not
there
nothing
else
to
do
but
go
and
if
there
were
i
would
do
it
it
will
take
you
at
least
hours
to
get
there
yes
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
jarvis
face
looked
as
if
he
thought
it
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
it
he
knew
that
dress
as
quietly
as
she
would
and
sally
dressing
for
the
street
meant
always
the
plainest
and
simplest
of
attire
there
was
that
about
her
which
invariably
attracted
attention
he
understood
with
just
what
a
barrier
of
youthful
reserve
she
would
be
likely
to
surround
herself
upon
such
a
journey
but
he
understood
also
that
barriers
of
reserve
are
not
all
the
defences
sometimes
necessary
for
a
girl
who
travels
alone
for
one
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
must
go
along
to
take
care
of
her
in
the
next
that
nothing
could
be
more
out
of
the
question
i
glad
it
no
farther
anyhow
he
replied
to
sally
quick
question
but
had
you
better
let
the
boys
know
before
you
go
at
your
preparations
max
would
be
pleased
at
not
being
consulted
you
know
will
you
tell
him
please
but
first
find
out
what
train
i
must
take
so
you
can
be
definite
with
him
but
sally
really
should
you
ask
old
maxy
consent
why
well
it
the
diplomatic
thing
to
do
i
do
care
one
bit
about
diplomacy
uncle
timmy
sick
and
wants
me
i
going
up
to
get
ready
you
can
telephone
what
you
like
with
something
in
her
voice
which
sounded
suspiciously
like
a
sob
she
ran
away
up
the
stairs
knitting
his
brows
jarvis
went
into
the
west
wing
to
the
telephone
that
instrument
having
been
promptly
installed
upon
the
burnside
arrival
for
the
summer
after
considering
a
minute
he
called
up
a
railway
and
learned
that
the
best
through
train
sally
could
take
would
leave
at
that
afternoon
his
watch
told
him
that
it
was
then
nearly
half
after
three
there
must
be
rapid
work
if
sally
was
to
catch
that
train
then
he
had
max
on
the
wire
statement
question
and
answer
now
came
back
and
forth
in
quick
succession
what
start
max
tone
was
incredulous
so
she
wants
to
do
with
your
permission
i
suppose
you
give
it
by
the
despatch
we
judge
he
pretty
well
but
look
here
i
must
say
that
asking
a
good
deal
for
her
to
go
off
up
there
why
not
wire
whoever
sent
the
thing
to
keep
us
informed
and
if
he
gets
much
worse
wo
do
she
already
answered
she
go
well
of
all
the
see
here
but
we
ca
really
afford
i
see
to
that
do
mention
it
jarvis
tone
was
curt
he
was
beginning
to
sympathize
with
sally
reluctance
to
consult
her
elder
brother
he
wondered
if
max
would
ever
outgrow
his
habit
of
objecting
to
everything
first
and
unwillingly
taking
it
into
consideration
afterward
i
awfully
busy
here
ca
do
a
thing
to
get
her
off
ca
get
away
from
the
bank
before
five
do
try
meet
us
at
the
train
i
engage
a
berth
for
her
lose
more
time
about
it
and
jarvis
his
receiver
without
waiting
to
hear
anything
further
then
he
had
a
wrestle
with
the
pullman
in
the
attempt
to
secure
a
full
section
for
sally
ca
do
it
came
back
the
answer
too
full
no
but
we
do
give
a
section
to
one
passenger
not
if
it
paid
for
not
on
one
ticket
on
two
tickets
then
why
of
course
if
you
want
to
pay
for
two
tickets
jarvis
considered
rapidly
if
he
secured
the
section
on
two
tickets
sally
would
be
forced
to
show
them
both
so
she
could
be
kept
from
knowing
about
it
unless
he
yes
he
could
hunt
up
the
pullman
conductor
and
give
him
one
ticket
wait
why
not
engage
a
if
he
could
get
it
at
this
late
hour
though
the
train
was
a
fast
and
popular
one
and
he
knew
this
was
doubtful
but
a
moment
reflection
negatived
this
idea
sally
would
certainly
resent
his
taking
the
liberty
of
paying
all
the
difference
between
one
ordinary
berth
and
a
luxuriously
private
he
realized
with
a
sense
of
irritation
that
it
was
of
no
use
he
could
not
send
sally
up
into
new
hampshire
packed
in
cotton
marked
fragile
and
valuable
a
registered
package
conveyed
by
special
messenger
but
he
could
make
sure
that
nobody
else
shared
the
section
either
by
night
or
day
and
this
he
did
and
his
reservation
until
he
could
get
to
town
to
see
about
it
personally
then
he
ran
over
to
the
ferry
cottage
thinking
that
sally
might
be
glad
in
the
absence
of
the
girls
to
have
mrs
ferry
come
over
and
help
her
with
her
hurried
preparations
but
he
found
the
place
locked
and
silent
and
understood
that
the
mistress
of
it
had
probably
gone
into
town
for
the
day
as
she
frequently
did
so
he
dashed
back
and
upstairs
to
joanna
room
where
he
routed
her
from
her
sewing
with
the
request
go
see
if
you
can
be
mother
sister
and
friend
to
miss
sally
joanna
there
an
angel
which
intimate
form
of
address
may
be
comprehended
if
it
is
added
that
joanna
had
been
in
the
burnside
family
since
jarvis
himself
was
a
small
lad
in
knickerbockers
and
the
good
woman
especial
pride
and
that
therefore
a
warm
friendship
existed
between
them
joanna
made
all
haste
to
sally
room
ready
to
do
her
best
but
she
found
her
charge
already
clad
in
travelling
dress
pinning
a
veil
about
her
hat
her
gloves
and
purse
laid
out
and
a
bag
packed
with
necessaries
the
mind
of
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
was
concerned
less
with
her
own
preparations
than
with
the
comfort
of
those
she
was
to
leave
behind
you
take
good
care
of
them
wo
you
joanna
begged
sally
give
them
the
things
they
like
best
the
and
you
see
that
the
looks
the
way
i
like
to
have
it
when
they
come
home
you
the
fire
blazing
and
the
couch
pillows
plumped
up
and
you
know
they
like
a
nice
lot
of
shiny
red
apples
brought
up
to
eat
before
they
go
to
bed
yes
miss
sally
i
remember
all
the
things
do
you
fret
yourself
i
ca
take
your
place
but
i
see
that
the
young
gentlemen
have
their
buttons
sewed
on
and
plenty
of
good
food
but
i
hoping
you
wo
be
gone
long
most
likely
you
find
your
uncle
better
i
hope
that
indeed
i
do
miss
sally
thank
you
joanna
indeed
i
do
too
and
joanna
i
so
glad
here
i
do
think
i
could
go
away
and
leave
my
brothers
with
just
little
mary
ann
to
look
after
them
sally
held
the
big
hand
tight
a
minute
looked
into
the
plump
kind
face
with
eyes
which
were
suddenly
like
drenched
violets
then
dashed
away
the
tears
smiled
at
joanna
caught
up
her
belongings
and
ran
downstairs
followed
by
the
woman
who
felt
relieved
when
she
saw
jarvis
waiting
in
the
hall
below
it
had
suddenly
seemed
to
joanna
as
if
she
must
go
with
the
girl
herself
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
sally
did
not
possess
plenty
of
the
air
of
capable
independence
it
was
only
that
well
the
fair
curly
hair
the
blue
eyes
the
bloom
of
the
young
face
appealed
to
her
as
they
did
to
jarvis
as
needing
protection
from
the
eyes
sure
to
follow
her
wherever
she
went
looking
up
at
her
from
below
it
also
occurred
to
jarvis
that
the
plain
and
unrelieved
dark
blue
of
sally
whole
attire
somehow
served
only
to
heighten
the
probable
effect
of
her
upon
the
observant
public
and
he
longed
fiercely
himself
to
double
the
thickness
of
that
veil
and
tie
it
tight
about
her
head
requesting
her
not
to
untie
it
till
she
was
safe
in
uncle
timothy
presence
but
all
he
said
was
ready
you
a
quick
one
would
have
thought
any
girl
could
make
such
time
this
all
your
baggage
come
on
the
at
the
door
outside
he
spoke
hurriedly
sally
you
have
given
me
a
chance
to
ask
you
about
funds
for
this
trip
one
ca
always
lay
one
hand
on
just
the
amount
and
max
is
busy
so
but
sally
answered
with
assurance
it
all
right
thank
you
jarvis
i
a
little
fund
of
my
own
there
is
any
need
to
bother
max
i
so
glad
of
that
how
lucky
for
me
you
had
gone
with
the
car
i
should
have
been
so
flurried
trying
to
catch
the
trolley
with
my
bag
and
umbrella
she
took
her
place
and
in
a
minute
they
were
off
and
there
had
been
nobody
but
joanna
on
the
big
porch
to
wave
at
sally
lane
then
came
a
fast
drive
to
town
during
which
neither
of
them
talked
much
i
wish
there
were
time
to
take
you
up
to
the
house
to
see
mother
and
jo
jarvis
said
as
they
came
into
the
streets
but
jo
may
be
at
the
station
i
telephoned
the
house
but
they
evidently
driven
somewhere
else
before
going
home
i
left
word
so
i
hoping
jo
will
get
it
she
be
if
you
get
off
without
her
seeing
you
but
josephine
was
not
at
the
station
alec
and
bob
were
there
however
and
they
told
sally
that
max
would
come
in
time
to
see
her
off
personally
they
were
much
upset
at
the
outlook
i
do
see
why
you
have
to
be
the
one
protested
alec
uncle
timothy
must
have
some
ancient
sister
or
cousin
or
aunt
to
see
to
him
without
sending
for
a
girl
like
you
jarvis
had
rushed
away
to
the
and
sally
had
her
brothers
to
herself
for
the
time
she
made
the
most
of
it
but
he
has
alec
she
explained
i
simply
have
to
go
but
i
want
you
boys
not
to
mind
my
being
away
joanna
will
take
beautiful
care
of
everything
and
you
must
have
your
friends
out
and
crack
nuts
and
pop
corn
and
roast
apples
in
the
evenings
and
be
just
as
jolly
as
if
oh
cried
bob
sally
what
do
you
take
us
for
what
we
do
will
be
to
moon
around
the
fire
and
wonder
what
you
doing
we
no
no
it
will
be
winter
soon
and
you
must
go
tobogganing
why
you
are
going
to
stay
away
all
winter
are
you
alec
grew
wrathful
look
here
i
wo
stand
for
anything
like
that
neither
will
the
rest
you
got
to
listen
dear
i
may
be
back
in
a
well
in
a
very
short
time
if
uncle
timothy
gets
on
but
you
know
how
it
was
a
few
years
ago
when
he
had
pneumonia
he
was
a
long
time
getting
about
he
older
now
and
yes
but
we
first
right
to
you
besides
you
use
yourself
all
up
trying
to
nurse
no
i
strong
and
well
alec
i
wo
use
myself
up
but
uncle
timmy
is
all
we
have
left
and
oh
please
do
talk
about
it
i
so
anxious
lest
i
ca
do
anything
for
him
when
i
get
there
she
conquered
a
constriction
in
her
throat
while
they
waited
for
that
last
phrase
had
silenced
them
they
were
all
fond
of
uncle
timothy
they
did
want
to
lose
him
in
a
minute
sally
went
on
cheerfully
if
you
only
write
to
me
i
can
stand
anything
tell
me
all
about
everything
oh
here
max
she
turned
to
meet
him
he
was
looking
gravely
disapproving
as
was
to
have
been
expected
but
something
in
the
sight
of
his
sister
face
made
him
refrain
from
reproaching
her
for
not
having
consulted
him
as
he
had
intended
to
do
besides
the
hands
of
the
clock
were
pointing
too
nearly
to
the
time
of
her
departure
for
him
to
feel
like
thrusting
upon
her
the
weight
of
his
displeasure
jarvis
came
back
tickets
in
hand
and
gave
them
to
sally
with
the
little
purse
she
had
handed
him
announcing
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
he
then
convoyed
the
whole
party
through
the
door
to
the
trains
using
some
influence
which
he
possessed
with
the
official
thereat
to
obtain
the
favour
so
the
passengers
already
in
the
crowded
sleeper
were
treated
to
the
somewhat
unusual
spectacle
of
a
particularly
charming
girl
being
brought
aboard
her
train
by
a
party
of
four
quietly
solicitous
young
men
even
the
youngest
of
them
by
virtue
of
his
height
and
broad
shoulders
counting
as
a
male
jarvis
went
off
for
a
hasty
interview
with
the
pullman
conductor
then
hunted
up
the
porter
of
sally
car
the
lucatia
and
gave
him
certain
instructions
accompanied
by
a
transfer
of
something
which
brought
a
broad
grin
to
that
person
dusky
face
with
the
assertion
suah
sah
i
make
the
young
lady
thank
you
sah
he
got
back
to
the
lucatia
only
in
time
to
hear
the
call
of
all
aboard
from
outside
to
see
the
blue
veil
surrounded
by
three
brothers
bestowing
hurried
but
hearty
testimonials
of
their
affection
and
bidding
her
take
care
of
yourself
write
often
and
do
kill
yourself
working
and
to
push
past
them
as
they
made
for
the
door
to
say
his
own
it
was
easy
for
the
interested
to
see
that
this
young
man
evidently
was
not
a
brother
for
his
farewell
consisted
only
of
a
somewhat
prolonged
grip
of
the
hand
his
hat
off
his
eyes
searching
the
blue
ones
lifted
to
his
with
the
expression
of
one
who
can
not
quite
trust
her
lips
to
speak
then
without
a
word
on
either
side
jarvis
had
dropped
sally
hand
and
was
rushing
to
the
door
for
the
train
was
under
way
remembering
suddenly
that
this
happened
to
be
the
last
car
on
the
train
when
she
came
in
sally
hurried
through
it
to
the
rear
there
they
were
lined
up
in
a
solid
row
and
as
she
appeared
their
hats
came
off
and
were
waved
in
the
air
beneath
the
bright
electric
lights
of
the
station
she
could
see
their
cheerful
smiles
and
she
smiled
back
waving
her
handkerchief
as
long
as
she
could
see
them
from
their
point
of
view
the
picture
was
quite
as
absorbing
as
from
hers
for
her
slender
figure
holding
to
the
brass
rail
of
the
platform
against
the
background
of
the
car
looked
both
girlish
and
solitary
and
as
they
watched
it
recede
into
the
distance
they
were
all
of
them
hoping
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
they
could
welcome
her
back
into
that
same
great
dingy
station
if
you
have
any
pity
on
us
jarve
come
back
to
the
house
and
do
go
home
to
stay
in
town
till
she
comes
we
shall
be
bluer
than
tombstones
this
was
max
double
tribute
to
the
homemaking
qualities
of
his
sister
and
to
the
partnership
qualities
of
his
friend
and
jarvis
responded
readily
for
truth
told
it
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
to
do
most
it
seemed
to
him
that
while
he
should
not
miss
sally
less
in
the
house
whose
every
corner
would
be
eloquent
of
her
absence
there
would
be
a
certain
consolation
in
being
there
he
had
a
queer
feeling
that
she
had
not
gone
for
a
speedy
return
and
that
more
than
one
moon
would
change
before
they
should
see
her
again
meanwhile
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
would
like
to
have
him
there
for
her
brothers
sake
since
they
wanted
him
alec
and
bob
eagerly
echoed
max
plea
bachelors
hall
well
i
do
know
that
i
mind
since
my
stuff
has
gone
back
yet
mother
and
jo
have
company
asked
for
next
week
and
will
expect
me
to
help
entertain
but
i
can
be
out
at
strawberry
acres
more
or
less
come
up
to
the
house
in
the
car
with
me
while
i
explain
then
we
drive
out
al
and
bob
can
ride
on
the
running
boards
if
they
like
they
jumped
on
feeling
that
to
stay
together
was
to
mind
things
less
it
was
odd
how
low
of
spirit
they
all
were
already
surely
one
would
think
that
four
strapping
fellows
might
contemplate
getting
on
for
a
space
without
one
slim
young
person
who
was
accustomed
not
only
to
humour
them
but
to
make
three
of
them
toe
certain
marks
in
the
matter
of
clean
linen
fresh
cravats
and
carefully
parted
hair
yet
not
one
of
them
was
really
willing
to
go
home
till
the
others
should
be
coming
along
too
in
front
of
the
fireplace
later
when
joanna
had
given
them
so
good
a
dinner
that
it
would
seem
as
if
their
content
could
hardly
be
preyed
upon
by
any
contemplation
of
the
future
bob
suddenly
voiced
the
general
sentiment
he
was
lying
on
his
side
upon
the
his
round
face
fiery
from
his
proximity
to
the
blaze
why
does
it
feel
so
different
when
you
know
people
are
miles
away
and
getting
farther
every
minute
than
when
you
know
they
just
gone
to
town
for
a
party
he
queried
thoughtfully
they
away
just
the
same
they
are
here
i
mean
why
is
being
away
the
same
thing
as
at
any
other
time
this
somewhat
involved
statement
of
conditions
would
have
provoked
jeers
from
the
company
but
no
jeers
were
forthcoming
max
grunted
lying
flat
on
his
back
on
the
couch
whose
pillows
joanna
had
carefully
plumped
up
his
heels
on
the
arm
at
the
end
alec
standing
at
the
window
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
staring
out
into
the
frosty
night
turned
about
and
remarked
that
on
a
train
averaging
sixty
to
seventy
miles
an
hour
sally
must
already
be
out
of
the
state
wonder
if
she
asleep
speculated
bob
she
used
to
like
sleeping
on
sleepers
when
father
and
mother
used
to
take
us
around
so
much
say
she
had
a
whole
section
to
herself
at
least
till
we
left
and
nobody
was
coming
aboard
then
hope
she
has
the
luck
to
keep
it
funny
the
car
was
crowded
and
so
was
the
next
one
i
looked
in
plenty
of
people
may
get
on
before
midnight
reflected
alec
jarvis
picked
up
a
magazine
suppose
i
read
aloud
this
article
on
railroading
he
proposed
the
company
consented
and
he
began
he
had
not
read
two
pages
before
he
ran
so
to
speak
into
a
series
of
frightful
railway
wrecks
but
wishing
he
had
chosen
something
else
he
kept
on
till
suddenly
bob
interrupted
with
a
fierce
cut
it
i
got
her
knocked
into
five
thousand
pieces
now
i
dream
of
those
confounded
and
sally
in
the
midst
of
if
you
do
drop
that
magazine
the
others
murmured
a
somewhat
sheepish
assent
and
jarvis
turned
willingly
enough
to
a
tale
of
adventure
at
sea
a
snore
from
the
couch
interrupted
him
in
the
middle
of
a
most
thrilling
crisis
and
only
the
appearance
of
joanna
with
a
big
dish
of
shiny
apples
prevented
bob
from
following
suit
jove
joanna
you
a
good
one
how
did
you
come
to
think
of
it
asked
alec
selecting
a
beauty
and
setting
his
teeth
into
it
with
a
sense
of
refreshment
miss
sally
said
i
was
not
to
forget
anything
she
usually
did
alec
replied
joanna
if
you
remember
everything
she
usually
does
you
be
a
brick
joanna
cried
bob
rousing
to
his
opportunity
and
getting
up
on
his
knees
to
accept
his
apple
there
one
thing
she
does
that
nobody
can
possibly
do
for
her
thought
jarvis
as
consuming
the
crisp
cool
specimen
joanna
had
bestowed
upon
him
with
a
motherly
smile
for
the
boy
she
had
known
so
long
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
passing
the
piano
at
the
end
with
a
vivid
recollection
of
how
sally
was
accustomed
to
play
what
she
called
little
tunes
upon
it
in
the
firelight
and
that
to
fill
one
small
corner
of
her
place
in
the
home
she
has
made
here
chapter
xvii
the
southbound
limited
sally
first
letter
home
was
a
short
one
stating
merely
that
uncle
timothy
was
very
ill
very
glad
to
see
her
and
that
she
was
extremely
thankful
she
had
come
the
second
letter
two
days
later
showed
strong
anxiety
the
illness
was
pneumonia
although
not
in
its
severest
form
but
rudd
age
was
an
important
factor
in
the
case
for
a
week
bulletins
were
brief
then
came
a
long
letter
telling
of
improvement
the
minute
he
is
well
out
of
danger
she
ought
to
come
home
was
max
opinion
she
wo
though
alec
predicted
she
stay
till
she
can
bring
him
with
her
not
if
she
listens
to
me
and
max
set
about
writing
a
reply
which
would
indicate
to
his
sister
in
no
uncertain
terms
the
course
he
thought
she
should
pursue
her
answer
was
prompt
i
want
to
come
home
just
as
much
as
you
want
to
have
me
max
dear
but
it
is
so
much
to
uncle
timmy
to
have
me
with
him
i
ca
think
of
leaving
max
frowned
over
this
she
seems
to
consult
me
precious
little
about
anything
lately
he
observed
to
jarvis
you
must
admit
she
grown
up
and
can
think
for
herself
besides
much
as
i
like
to
see
her
back
i
think
she
right
was
jarvis
opinion
of
course
you
side
with
her
against
me
every
time
but
i
think
her
brothers
are
a
trifle
nearer
to
her
than
her
uncle
she
undoubtedly
think
so
too
if
you
were
in
bed
with
pneumonia
since
you
all
in
vigorous
health
she
imagines
you
can
get
on
without
her
but
she
not
having
a
very
jolly
time
of
it
i
should
judge
cheer
her
up
with
a
lively
letter
not
a
peevish
one
was
jarvis
advice
you
can
do
that
i
not
writing
not
max
was
surprised
you
and
sally
have
quarrelled
have
you
not
at
all
but
i
no
reason
to
think
she
would
care
to
hear
from
me
you
fellows
are
undoubtedly
telling
her
all
the
news
jarvis
flung
a
fresh
log
on
the
fire
as
he
spoke
then
took
his
place
on
the
with
his
back
to
the
blaze
and
his
face
in
the
shadow
max
stared
at
him
interestedly
and
was
about
to
begin
a
discussion
of
the
subject
when
his
companion
abruptly
opened
up
a
new
line
of
conversation
in
relation
to
plans
for
the
farm
and
the
moment
for
asking
certain
questions
did
not
occur
again
the
days
went
by
brief
letters
from
sally
arriving
at
frequent
intervals
they
reported
very
slow
improvement
in
the
invalid
with
a
return
of
strength
so
tardy
that
she
still
felt
she
should
not
leave
him
the
home
in
which
they
were
was
not
that
of
relatives
and
she
was
unwilling
to
leave
the
responsibility
of
rudd
care
to
those
who
had
expected
to
have
him
with
them
only
for
a
brief
visit
a
month
passed
and
then
just
as
her
brothers
were
making
up
their
minds
that
the
limit
had
certainly
been
reached
and
her
duty
done
came
a
letter
which
gave
a
blow
to
their
hopes
it
read
dearest
family
doctor
wood
has
ordered
uncle
timmy
south
the
doctor
says
he
positively
must
get
out
of
this
wretched
climate
and
he
must
not
think
of
coming
back
before
spring
and
spring
well
advanced
if
you
could
see
what
a
shadow
of
himself
the
poor
dear
is
you
would
understand
that
i
simply
must
do
what
i
have
agreed
to
do
go
with
him
he
will
pay
all
my
expenses
i
think
he
must
have
quite
a
bit
more
property
than
we
have
known
of
the
matter
of
finances
seems
to
trouble
him
so
little
of
course
i
know
how
you
will
feel
about
this
and
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
feel
a
thousand
times
sorrier
than
you
possibly
can
but
i
know
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
he
ca
possibly
go
alone
and
i
ca
see
mother
only
brother
have
to
hire
some
stranger
to
be
with
him
when
he
has
a
niece
who
loves
him
dearly
and
owes
him
for
a
deal
of
love
he
has
always
lavished
on
her
it
is
as
if
you
needed
me
in
ways
that
joanna
could
supply
for
actual
food
and
drink
i
mean
of
course
i
hope
i
know
you
all
miss
your
little
sister
i
afraid
i
should
feel
very
badly
if
i
thought
you
did
we
plan
to
start
thursday
evening
december
third
we
ca
make
quite
as
good
connections
as
i
did
in
coming
so
according
to
doctor
figuring
with
the
we
shall
go
through
the
home
city
at
one
on
saturday
morning
we
shall
be
in
the
station
twenty
minutes
being
switched
around
and
well
i
do
like
to
ask
anybody
to
stay
up
till
that
hour
but
i
shall
be
up
and
looking
out
and
and
i
almost
afraid
that
if
i
did
see
anybody
i
should
shed
just
a
tear
or
two
you
see
i
have
really
cried
once
yet
and
i
do
want
to
break
my
record
your
sally
it
really
is
not
necessary
to
report
what
was
said
in
sally
home
upon
the
receipt
of
this
announcement
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excited
talking
done
and
a
number
of
statements
were
made
to
the
effect
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
sally
to
be
spared
all
winter
that
she
should
have
waited
for
the
consent
of
her
family
before
deciding
on
such
an
absence
and
that
it
absolutely
must
not
be
allowed
yet
after
all
when
it
came
to
forbidding
it
nobody
seemed
to
have
quite
the
authority
to
do
that
even
max
protesting
that
the
thing
was
out
of
all
reason
and
going
so
far
as
to
take
his
pen
in
hand
to
write
his
refusal
to
permit
it
found
himself
brought
to
a
halt
by
the
remembrance
that
sally
was
showing
more
and
more
evidences
of
possessing
a
will
of
her
own
and
of
being
perfectly
competent
to
carry
out
its
dictates
when
they
seemed
to
her
right
clearly
she
did
not
want
to
go
south
with
uncle
timothy
or
with
anybody
else
there
was
a
homesick
touch
in
more
than
one
line
of
the
stoutly
written
letter
unquestionably
sally
would
not
be
doing
this
thing
if
she
were
not
persuaded
of
her
duty
at
one
in
the
morning
of
saturday
a
party
of
people
stood
in
the
great
station
again
the
offices
of
jarvis
burnside
had
taken
the
group
past
the
usual
hindrances
and
established
them
on
a
certain
platform
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
rows
of
tracks
where
the
southbound
limited
would
come
in
this
time
their
numbers
were
considerably
augmented
by
the
presence
of
burnside
and
josephine
donald
and
janet
ferry
various
packages
encumbered
the
arms
of
each
member
of
the
party
and
appearances
certainly
boded
well
for
the
reception
of
the
young
traveller
who
at
the
moment
was
watching
eagerly
as
the
train
rolled
through
the
familiar
streets
for
the
first
sign
of
approach
to
the
station
here
she
comes
bob
was
the
first
to
cry
pointing
to
a
brilliant
headlight
just
rounding
into
view
on
the
distant
track
jolly
i
bet
sally
wide
awake
if
she
ever
was
in
her
life
i
expect
we
going
to
find
out
now
how
dreadfully
short
twenty
minutes
can
be
said
janet
ferry
to
jarvis
beside
whom
she
stood
an
attractively
basket
of
grapes
in
her
hand
he
nodded
watching
the
great
headlight
grow
all
too
slowly
bigger
and
bigger
even
the
twenty
minutes
will
probably
be
cut
short
the
considerably
overdue
now
the
long
line
of
sleepers
came
to
a
beside
them
and
they
scanned
the
cars
anxiously
for
the
first
sign
of
sally
far
down
the
track
could
be
seen
a
coloured
porter
waving
in
their
direction
and
the
next
instant
a
girl
in
dark
blue
jumped
off
the
step
of
the
pullman
and
ran
toward
them
they
ran
to
meet
her
bob
and
alec
outstripping
the
rest
and
when
the
others
arrived
all
that
could
be
seen
of
sally
lane
was
the
top
of
a
bright
head
on
bob
shoulder
both
blue
arms
about
his
neck
his
affectionate
hand
patting
her
back
then
they
had
her
in
their
midst
and
everybody
was
trying
to
greet
her
at
once
josephine
arm
was
about
her
and
sally
was
regarding
the
group
with
a
radiant
smile
crying
girlishly
oh
how
good
you
people
do
look
how
dear
of
you
all
to
come
down
if
i
only
could
stay
just
a
little
longer
we
do
stop
but
ten
minutes
instead
of
twenty
the
train
is
so
late
uncle
tim
does
know
you
are
here
i
was
afraid
he
would
be
too
excited
to
sleep
the
rest
of
the
night
and
he
only
just
dropped
off
oh
how
are
you
all
you
look
perfectly
fine
i
do
believe
pined
away
a
bit
missing
me
let
me
look
at
you
she
studied
each
in
turn
missing
nobody
her
clear
gaze
the
blue
eyes
black
beneath
the
shadowing
thick
lashes
met
each
answering
pair
of
eyes
with
a
steady
scrutiny
which
did
not
once
waver
that
was
a
review
one
would
be
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
stand
said
ferry
to
josephine
as
sally
ended
by
thrusting
her
arm
through
max
and
leading
him
off
by
himself
miss
sally
put
us
all
to
the
test
in
that
minute
did
she
she
gives
the
impression
of
demanding
the
best
one
has
rather
an
unusual
characteristic
in
a
girl
of
her
age
she
does
demand
the
best
and
gets
it
answered
josephine
warmly
ten
feet
away
sally
was
speaking
hurriedly
the
thing
i
wanted
most
to
see
you
for
maxy
was
to
make
sure
you
were
really
angry
with
me
for
taking
my
own
way
about
this
her
hand
pressed
his
arm
she
was
looking
up
into
his
face
he
returned
the
gaze
i
was
angry
sis
he
admitted
but
somehow
now
that
i
see
you
i
ca
seem
to
get
up
steam
to
tell
you
so
i
suppose
right
but
the
place
is
mighty
lonesome
without
you
if
it
was
for
the
ferrys
are
they
over
much
we
get
them
over
as
often
as
we
can
i
say
i
been
noticing
that
jarve
and
janet
seem
to
hit
it
off
pretty
well
do
they
that
very
nice
you
like
janet
yourself
do
you
she
the
belle
of
the
ball
now
you
away
and
a
mighty
jolly
girl
to
have
around
if
you
do
look
out
your
old
friend
will
slip
away
from
you
sally
head
went
up
her
cheeks
bloomed
a
deeper
colour
if
i
going
to
leave
you
in
a
minute
i
should
punish
you
for
that
piece
of
brotherly
impertinence
said
she
with
spirit
have
i
ever
laid
hands
on
anybody
to
keep
him
for
you
to
talk
of
away
no
you
not
that
sort
conceded
max
with
a
laugh
which
certainly
carried
a
hint
of
brotherly
admiration
sally
walked
straight
over
to
janet
at
whose
other
side
stood
jarvis
janet
said
she
max
says
you
are
the
life
of
them
all
i
so
glad
and
it
so
kind
of
your
mother
and
brother
to
bring
you
over
to
make
the
evenings
pleasant
you
keep
on
being
good
to
them
all
winter
wo
you
sally
janet
caught
hold
of
both
her
hands
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
of
how
nobly
and
completely
i
fill
your
place
the
last
time
we
were
over
i
played
for
them
played
my
best
too
i
ended
with
my
most
brilliant
performance
of
liszt
two
minutes
afterward
when
i
had
gone
back
to
the
fire
i
heard
somebody
very
softly
doing
a
melody
picking
it
out
note
by
note
i
listened
and
presently
made
out
one
of
your
favourite
tunes
red
red
rose
i
looked
around
the
group
to
see
who
was
missing
it
was
not
bob
it
was
not
max
it
was
not
alec
it
was
not
don
it
was
not
anybody
it
was
a
ghost
supplied
jarvis
he
was
looking
intently
at
sally
but
she
was
smiling
back
at
janet
and
the
colour
in
her
face
was
not
less
than
it
had
been
a
moment
before
my
ghost
probably
she
said
lightly
i
sure
if
it
were
with
you
all
by
that
fire
as
often
as
i
think
about
you
it
would
be
playing
little
tunes
for
itself
most
of
the
time
now
i
must
spend
my
next
minute
with
alec
and
she
was
away
again
the
minutes
certainly
were
flying
janet
looked
after
her
there
something
perfectly
irresistible
about
her
is
there
she
suggested
to
her
companion
he
did
not
answer
and
she
glanced
at
him
he
had
pulled
out
a
from
his
pocket
and
was
writing
something
on
one
of
the
cards
he
slipped
the
card
into
the
big
green
he
held
suppose
i
take
all
our
packages
to
the
porter
and
have
him
put
them
in
her
berth
while
she
is
off
with
alec
then
she
not
have
to
bother
with
them
getting
on
he
proposed
janet
assented
and
in
a
minute
jarvis
laden
with
packages
approached
the
porter
retaining
half
his
burden
he
followed
the
porter
into
the
car
he
did
not
immediately
return
therefrom
and
when
three
minutes
afterward
the
signal
came
for
the
departure
of
the
train
he
was
not
in
the
group
of
whom
she
took
leave
has
jarvis
gone
say
for
me
to
him
please
jo
she
whispered
as
she
embraced
her
friend
waving
the
others
back
max
escorted
her
into
her
car
in
the
passage
they
met
jarvis
over
her
head
the
two
young
men
looked
at
each
other
sister
said
max
and
kissed
her
i
see
jarve
wants
me
to
cut
it
short
with
which
tactful
brotherly
explanation
he
abruptly
retraced
his
steps
to
the
vestibule
where
he
waited
in
the
narrow
passage
jarvis
made
the
most
of
his
minute
of
grace
although
sally
hand
was
already
extended
and
a
friendly
with
a
frank
smile
was
on
her
lips
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
rid
of
me
said
he
taking
the
hand
you
make
me
feel
somehow
as
if
you
did
care
even
for
the
old
friendship
is
that
so
sally
not
at
all
i
care
very
much
it
seems
so
good
to
see
you
all
to
see
all
does
flatter
me
much
he
smiled
a
little
sally
may
i
write
to
you
do
tell
me
all
about
everybody
will
you
answer
now
and
then
you
are
he
stopped
with
a
half
impatient
movement
of
his
broad
shoulders
i
sally
lane
she
said
this
very
distinctly
even
though
both
were
speaking
under
their
breath
then
she
laughed
with
a
delicate
touch
of
defiance
you
certainly
are
he
agreed
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
that
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
jarvis
burnside
and
that
stands
for
something
too
something
positive
and
permanent
my
letters
will
be
signed
by
that
name
mine
if
i
write
any
now
and
then
will
be
signed
by
mine
the
train
is
moving
old
friend
she
was
a
slim
maid
to
oppose
so
colossal
a
resistance
as
she
did
to
anything
in
the
least
suggestive
to
sentiment
in
the
oppose
it
however
did
the
small
hand
which
drew
itself
away
with
decision
the
pretty
lips
which
smiled
again
that
coolly
friendly
smile
the
eyes
which
were
steady
as
ever
in
their
straight
look
max
peering
in
upon
the
two
to
tell
jarvis
to
come
along
saw
his
sister
break
down
in
her
but
only
at
sight
of
himself
as
jarvis
turned
away
she
ran
after
him
to
reach
beyond
him
and
clutch
her
brother
arm
for
one
quick
pressure
with
the
low
cry
oh
max
write
to
me
often
as
max
jumped
off
jarvis
turned
again
sally
was
upon
the
platform
that
almost
makes
me
wish
i
were
a
brother
said
he
rapidly
from
the
bottom
step
looking
straight
up
at
her
he
prepared
to
drop
off
not
he
added
and
swung
himself
off
and
out
of
sight
back
in
her
berth
the
little
electric
on
sally
opened
her
bundles
their
contents
made
her
feel
like
laughing
and
crying
both
together
all
by
herself
there
on
the
fast
train
flying
southward
through
the
night
janet
superb
grapes
mrs
ferry
preserved
canton
ginger
donald
ferry
little
book
of
verse
with
the
ribbon
mark
opening
it
at
my
garden
all
pleased
her
greatly
each
in
its
way
then
there
was
a
fascinating
little
traveller
from
josephine
a
letter
from
burnside
an
from
max
a
package
of
current
magazines
from
alec
a
box
of
chocolates
from
bob
the
cards
and
merry
messages
accompanying
these
remembrances
made
pleasant
reading
and
sally
put
them
all
together
in
her
handbag
that
she
might
look
them
over
many
times
jarvis
box
she
did
not
open
till
the
last
why
might
be
a
subject
for
speculation
does
one
leave
the
most
interesting
letter
or
package
till
the
last
or
does
one
eagerly
open
it
first
when
everything
else
had
been
disposed
of
sally
fingers
untied
the
cord
slowly
she
lifted
the
cover
with
apparent
reluctance
she
drew
aside
the
sheltering
sheets
of
green
tissue
as
if
she
feared
to
disclose
that
which
they
protected
but
then
when
the
bright
light
at
her
side
shone
in
upon
fresh
tints
of
pink
and
white
and
lilac
she
drew
one
deep
breath
and
buried
her
face
in
the
mass
sweet
peas
she
murmured
and
shut
her
eyes
and
thought
of
her
garden
lying
forsaken
and
desolate
in
the
december
frost
then
she
picked
up
the
card
on
its
back
she
read
in
vigorous
pencilling
a
ghost
from
the
garden
sent
by
the
ghost
who
tried
to
pick
out
the
tune
there
seem
no
other
tunes
in
the
world
worth
listening
to
the
next
morning
timothy
rudd
had
many
questions
to
ask
his
niece
he
sat
comfortably
among
pillows
and
rugs
his
breakfast
brought
in
from
the
and
served
in
his
section
by
a
waiter
who
was
ready
to
show
him
every
attention
to
oblige
the
young
lady
whose
smile
he
liked
to
win
you
say
they
were
all
down
sally
this
breakfast
looks
very
nice
my
dear
i
wish
i
could
eat
more
of
it
he
laid
down
a
half
slice
of
toast
and
brushed
his
thin
fingers
uncle
timmy
are
you
sure
you
ca
manage
just
a
little
more
two
spoonfuls
of
boiled
egg
half
a
slice
of
toast
and
a
cup
of
coffee
that
no
breakfast
at
all
if
i
tell
you
all
about
it
wo
you
eat
just
half
the
egg
i
try
child
but
really
the
old
fellow
who
is
wearing
my
clothes
and
not
half
big
enough
for
them
does
seem
to
be
able
to
summon
much
of
an
appetite
if
you
do
eat
a
good
breakfast
i
shall
feel
more
than
ever
guilty
for
not
telling
you
they
were
coming
though
of
course
i
did
dream
of
their
coming
but
if
you
had
seen
them
you
would
have
slept
a
bit
no
like
enough
i
should
i
be
satisfied
if
you
tell
me
how
they
all
looked
the
boys
max
very
well
indeed
he
a
trifle
heavier
than
when
i
went
away
cooking
is
beginning
to
tell
i
think
she
pampers
them
do
you
so
grateful
to
her
for
that
alec
just
as
usual
he
was
wearing
a
new
overcoat
and
looked
a
glass
of
fashion
he
says
as
long
as
mr
ferry
lives
in
the
country
in
the
winter
he
willing
to
stand
it
there
is
it
lucky
they
staying
at
least
one
more
year
by
another
winter
the
demands
on
mr
ferry
in
town
may
be
so
heavy
he
ca
take
time
to
go
back
and
forth
yes
i
should
say
it
was
a
very
good
thing
for
alec
to
be
as
much
under
the
influence
of
such
a
man
as
could
be
brought
about
until
he
is
where
he
can
do
his
own
thinking
along
the
right
lines
how
is
my
nephew
robert
oh
bob
cheeks
are
so
round
and
red
they
look
like
a
very
large
infant
dear
bobby
think
he
misses
us
most
he
ran
in
and
peeped
into
your
berth
while
the
train
stood
there
i
think
he
rather
hoped
to
wake
you
bless
the
lad
i
wish
he
had
rudd
took
another
spoonful
of
egg
under
the
stimulus
of
the
wish
forgetting
that
he
had
not
meant
to
take
up
that
spoon
again
burnside
and
jo
looked
their
own
dear
selves
every
line
of
them
it
struck
me
afresh
as
it
always
does
when
i
see
them
after
an
interval
how
beautifully
yet
quietly
dressed
they
are
and
how
their
photographs
might
be
taken
at
any
minute
with
delightful
results
of
a
lady
and
her
daughter
it
would
be
and
sally
sighed
a
little
sigh
of
a
quite
feminine
sort
looking
down
at
her
own
blue
travelling
attire
and
wondering
how
the
same
material
would
have
looked
if
made
up
by
burnside
tailor
and
jarvis
how
is
he
i
am
very
fond
of
jarvis
i
suppose
he
has
lost
some
of
the
summer
tan
if
he
has
it
been
put
back
again
by
the
frosty
winds
for
he
the
image
of
health
mr
ferry
and
janet
are
very
much
themselves
too
and
they
all
sent
you
something
sally
reached
under
the
berth
and
drew
out
a
big
florists
box
signalled
the
waiter
to
remove
the
remains
of
the
breakfast
and
then
spread
forth
the
cards
which
accompanied
the
great
bunch
of
crimson
roses
enjoying
rudd
almost
boyish
pleasure
in
the
remembrance
of
his
friends
these
must
be
for
you
too
sally
said
he
burying
his
nose
in
one
fine
bud
not
a
bit
of
it
no
flowers
for
you
child
fruit
and
chocolates
and
and
other
delightful
things
you
must
have
some
of
the
grapes
uncle
timmy
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
them
for
your
breakfast
these
roses
are
as
good
as
a
square
meal
but
they
should
have
been
for
you
not
for
an
old
fossil
like
me
do
you
dare
call
yourself
an
old
fossil
uncle
timmy
now
look
at
all
these
pretty
gifts
and
sally
brought
them
forth
exhibiting
them
well
concealed
from
the
other
passengers
uncle
timothy
looked
and
exclaimed
and
admired
and
did
not
note
that
one
person
seemed
to
be
unrepresented
by
any
remembrance
neither
did
he
guess
that
tucked
far
away
under
sally
berth
was
a
box
containing
a
mass
of
sweet
peas
which
had
that
morning
been
carefully
sprinkled
but
which
were
destined
never
to
be
seen
again
by
mortal
eye
except
her
own
chapter
xviii
from
april
north
during
a
winter
which
seemed
in
spite
of
all
the
beauties
of
the
far
south
the
longest
she
had
ever
known
sally
was
kept
well
in
touch
with
affairs
at
home
by
the
letters
if
it
had
not
been
for
these
she
thought
she
could
hardly
have
waited
for
the
spring
to
come
rudd
had
gained
slowly
but
positively
throughout
the
winter
yet
it
was
not
thought
best
for
him
to
come
home
until
the
spring
should
be
well
advanced
the
first
of
may
was
the
date
set
and
proved
a
judicious
choice
for
april
was
a
cold
and
rainy
month
there
was
just
one
odd
fact
about
this
month
of
april
during
its
course
sally
received
at
least
one
letter
from
every
member
of
her
own
family
and
from
each
one
of
those
other
two
families
most
closely
connected
with
her
history
in
an
idle
hour
one
day
just
before
she
went
home
she
carefully
selected
one
letter
from
each
of
these
correspondents
in
the
order
received
and
tied
them
in
a
bunch
labelling
them
april
north
to
april
south
whatever
may
have
happened
to
other
letters
this
packet
remained
in
her
possession
for
many
years
the
first
of
them
arrived
on
april
fourth
and
was
in
the
round
hand
of
young
robert
lane
dear
sally
this
is
april
fool
day
and
i
had
a
great
old
time
fooling
everybody
sewed
down
the
knives
and
forks
to
the
tied
the
chairs
to
the
legs
salted
the
coffee
and
did
quite
a
few
little
stunts
like
that
max
got
maddest
when
he
ran
onto
a
big
lump
of
cayenne
in
his
oatmeal
but
joanna
gave
him
another
dish
right
away
and
another
cup
of
coffee
she
awfully
soft
over
old
max
the
best
lining
i
did
was
the
way
i
fooled
jarve
on
a
letter
from
you
i
knew
he
had
had
one
from
you
sometime
in
march
so
i
looked
in
his
while
he
was
up
in
the
timber
lot
with
a
sweater
on
i
found
it
pretty
much
used
up
with
being
carried
around
suppose
he
forgot
to
take
it
out
got
a
fresh
thin
envelope
put
the
old
one
inside
traced
the
address
through
pasted
on
a
postmark
from
your
last
one
to
me
and
put
three
heavy
sheets
inside
to
make
it
fat
a
lot
fatter
than
the
one
i
got
out
of
his
pocket
stuck
on
old
stamps
two
of
overweight
you
know
when
he
came
in
to
luncheon
he
found
the
letter
with
his
other
mail
i
had
my
eye
on
him
i
was
pretending
to
read
the
morning
paper
he
read
all
his
other
letters
but
he
put
that
one
in
his
pocket
he
got
terribly
jolly
after
that
cracking
jokes
and
everything
the
minute
luncheon
was
over
he
went
off
to
his
room
and
i
cut
for
did
let
him
get
a
sight
of
me
for
hours
when
i
did
come
in
i
thought
maybe
he
have
got
over
being
fussed
but
pitchforks
and
hammer
handles
if
the
minute
i
hove
in
sight
he
did
get
after
me
he
must
have
put
on
a
lot
of
muscle
chopping
wood
and
hoeing
for
i
thought
a
cyclone
had
struck
me
i
resting
up
now
but
i
feel
pretty
sore
yet
in
spots
that
why
i
writing
to
you
i
think
you
better
write
him
once
in
a
while
so
that
getting
what
he
thinks
is
a
letter
wo
go
to
his
head
like
that
it
be
the
first
of
may
in
one
month
more
and
you
be
home
jolly
that
seems
good
to
think
of
heaps
of
love
from
bob
on
the
following
day
came
a
letter
from
janet
ferry
it
was
a
letter
of
several
sheets
and
the
last
two
pages
ran
thus
the
boys
think
you
ought
not
to
know
about
it
and
intend
it
for
a
surprise
but
i
am
so
sure
that
it
will
do
you
even
more
good
to
hear
while
you
are
waiting
to
come
home
i
going
to
tell
you
alec
and
bob
have
been
rolling
the
lawn
with
a
roller
they
were
at
great
pains
to
get
from
the
burnside
place
in
the
city
you
should
have
seen
them
at
it
encouraging
each
other
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
afterward
they
scattered
wood
ashes
in
all
the
thin
places
bob
said
they
had
been
saving
them
all
winter
from
the
fireplace
i
did
know
alec
could
be
so
interested
in
labour
but
this
winter
seems
to
have
given
him
an
impetus
toward
following
burnside
example
and
don
for
i
think
don
has
had
a
hand
in
waking
him
up
speaking
of
don
i
found
him
out
in
your
garden
yesterday
pruning
your
old
the
ones
that
you
inherited
with
the
garden
he
says
you
are
particularly
fond
of
the
pink
ones
that
smell
so
much
sweeter
than
any
rose
that
ever
grew
burnside
has
been
busy
all
through
march
and
already
has
garden
peas
in
it
seems
absurdly
early
but
he
prophesies
that
there
be
no
more
frosts
that
they
ca
stand
and
promises
us
peas
on
the
table
three
weeks
earlier
than
our
neighbours
he
is
nothing
if
not
daring
he
reads
and
reads
in
those
books
and
magazines
and
papers
of
his
and
then
starts
out
armed
for
action
he
and
jake
spend
much
time
arguing
over
details
but
i
believe
he
usually
carries
his
point
don
says
that
while
he
was
finishing
his
work
in
your
garden
your
brother
max
came
home
and
strolled
out
to
see
what
he
was
doing
don
mentioned
the
fact
that
it
would
soon
be
time
for
the
whole
garden
to
be
dug
and
raked
and
put
in
spring
order
and
lane
answered
that
he
would
see
that
it
was
done
in
fact
he
thought
he
should
do
it
himself
i
do
exactly
understand
why
this
should
seem
to
give
don
so
much
satisfaction
but
it
does
he
told
me
to
be
sure
to
tell
you
clearly
it
gave
sally
satisfaction
also
for
she
read
this
particular
paragraph
a
second
time
smiling
to
herself
before
she
put
the
letter
aside
on
the
seventh
of
april
came
a
screed
from
alec
of
quite
surprising
length
for
alec
and
it
interested
his
sister
more
than
any
letter
she
had
had
from
him
during
the
winter
dear
sally
lunn
have
time
to
write
much
have
hired
out
as
a
farm
hand
and
he
keeps
a
fellow
some
busy
for
two
weeks
now
we
been
clearing
up
the
old
wood
in
the
timber
lot
and
getting
out
new
stuff
for
fence
posts
etc
evenings
he
gets
me
at
books
am
reading
up
on
soil
now
surprised
to
find
it
quite
interesting
and
i
talk
plans
a
lot
more
than
max
does
though
i
think
the
old
boy
is
going
to
get
into
it
in
time
all
right
maybe
you
like
to
know
what
our
plans
are
well
here
goes
cut
off
the
suckers
in
the
orchard
plough
and
later
spray
before
the
leaves
come
that
means
hustle
but
we
nearly
through
with
the
pruning
bob
and
mr
ferry
are
at
that
then
we
plough
five
acres
of
what
we
let
go
to
hay
last
year
and
plant
it
to
corn
with
half
an
acre
of
potatoes
the
other
five
acres
we
let
grow
to
hay
next
year
we
have
alfalfa
where
we
have
corn
this
year
is
daft
on
alfalfa
and
i
beginning
to
see
why
the
five
acres
of
hay
with
the
corn
will
be
enough
for
the
two
cows
and
we
keep
the
pasture
over
beyond
the
orchard
for
them
miss
janet
says
as
long
as
she
lives
there
she
wants
to
see
those
cows
or
other
ones
come
down
the
lane
by
the
orchard
at
milking
time
only
she
wishes
there
were
more
of
them
and
a
collie
to
drive
them
think
i
have
to
get
a
collie
to
satisfy
her
though
cowslip
and
whitenose
are
at
the
bars
regular
as
a
clock
all
by
themselves
the
seven
acres
where
we
had
the
buckwheat
and
afterward
the
potatoes
last
year
are
to
be
set
with
strawberries
this
may
i
tell
you
where
the
real
serious
business
comes
in
has
done
a
thing
this
winter
but
study
the
soil
in
that
seven
acres
and
figure
out
what
kind
of
berries
to
plant
he
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
what
sort
of
fertilizers
to
use
and
i
tell
you
if
there
any
such
thing
as
improving
soil
the
soil
in
that
strawberry
land
is
going
to
be
improved
tons
of
stuff
are
going
into
it
and
it
going
to
be
well
mixed
in
too
then
if
cultivating
and
irrigating
and
all
the
rest
of
it
can
bring
us
big
fruit
we
get
it
idea
is
the
more
we
put
in
the
more
we
get
out
and
the
better
quality
of
course
it
lucky
for
us
we
have
him
to
pay
out
the
money
for
getting
things
going
but
i
believe
strawberry
acres
will
support
itself
some
day
and
bring
us
in
good
returns
anyhow
i
must
say
i
beginning
to
like
the
whole
thing
though
hard
work
and
plenty
of
it
never
was
so
hungry
in
my
life
joanna
sets
it
up
to
us
in
good
shape
but
we
be
glad
to
see
you
back
house
seems
sort
of
empty
in
spite
of
four
fellows
tumbling
over
each
other
in
it
with
love
your
brother
alec
the
old
asparagus
bed
is
trying
so
hard
to
show
signs
of
life
we
given
it
a
good
salting
the
ferrys
crocuses
are
up
grass
all
full
of
them
look
mighty
pretty
this
was
certainly
very
satisfactory
when
one
considered
that
alec
had
been
in
the
beginning
only
second
to
max
in
scoffing
at
the
idea
of
living
on
a
farm
not
to
mention
working
on
one
more
than
any
of
the
boys
alec
had
preferred
life
in
the
city
had
been
the
one
who
cared
most
about
his
personal
appearance
and
had
prided
himself
upon
doing
things
in
the
urban
way
for
him
to
be
willing
to
put
on
old
clothes
and
rough
boots
and
soil
his
hands
with
manual
labour
indicated
a
change
of
thought
and
ideals
hardly
to
have
been
expected
so
soon
sally
put
away
the
letter
rejoicing
at
these
indications
of
growth
for
growth
it
surely
was
in
his
case
his
work
in
the
office
where
he
had
been
employed
had
been
work
likely
to
lead
no
further
nor
to
promise
any
promotion
to
a
position
of
greater
honour
but
on
strawberry
acres
it
seemed
to
sally
that
with
jarvis
burnside
for
a
leader
alec
might
develop
qualities
as
yet
only
to
be
guessed
at
the
most
interesting
part
of
josephine
long
letter
which
reached
sally
on
the
ninth
was
as
is
usually
the
case
in
feminine
letters
toward
its
close
after
every
other
subject
had
been
touched
upon
correspondent
remarked
you
may
care
to
know
that
i
have
been
much
surprised
of
late
to
receive
two
calls
here
at
home
from
mr
ferry
one
was
in
march
but
i
mention
it
for
i
thought
probably
it
was
the
first
last
and
only
one
he
would
ever
make
and
i
would
crow
about
it
it
was
on
one
of
mother
thursdays
and
of
course
a
lot
of
other
people
were
here
i
was
busy
with
the
tea
things
so
could
give
him
much
attention
he
was
very
nice
and
everybody
seemed
much
interested
to
see
him
here
when
he
went
away
he
came
over
and
said
to
me
that
he
should
like
to
come
again
when
we
were
not
at
home
only
at
home
of
course
i
said
he
might
and
mother
asked
him
specially
too
so
just
yesterday
evening
it
was
tuesday
he
came
again
mother
was
out
until
just
before
he
went
we
had
a
delightful
time
in
the
library
over
a
box
of
new
books
jarvis
had
just
had
sent
up
not
farm
books
this
time
mr
ferry
found
something
which
specially
pleased
him
and
read
several
pages
to
me
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
library
table
i
mean
that
he
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
it
not
i
i
was
most
properly
disposed
in
a
chair
and
congratulating
myself
that
i
had
on
a
little
new
home
frock
of
dull
green
with
bands
of
blue
and
gold
embroidery
that
had
just
come
home
the
most
becoming
thing
celeste
has
ever
made
me
i
think
he
had
a
good
time
anyhow
he
stayed
much
longer
than
he
need
have
done
if
he
did
i
meant
that
if
he
was
having
a
good
time
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
write
lucidly
we
talked
much
of
you
and
of
how
good
it
would
seem
to
have
you
back
and
of
the
garden
and
the
coming
summer
he
wanted
to
know
if
mother
and
i
were
coming
out
to
spend
the
season
again
and
i
said
yes
he
asked
if
i
did
think
we
ought
to
be
there
by
the
latter
part
of
april
so
as
to
welcome
you
when
you
come
the
first
of
may
it
seemed
rather
a
good
idea
to
me
what
do
you
think
of
it
mother
has
set
the
fifteenth
but
i
really
do
want
to
see
the
first
spring
things
coming
up
jarvis
brought
home
a
great
bunch
of
daffodils
yesterday
i
wanted
to
send
them
on
to
you
but
he
thought
they
would
last
out
the
journey
the
thought
of
the
daffodils
made
sally
long
intensely
for
her
garden
there
was
a
long
row
of
them
at
the
farther
end
and
another
clump
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
with
stray
ones
here
and
there
through
the
grass
which
she
had
not
been
willing
to
have
removed
she
thought
about
them
many
times
until
the
arrival
of
the
next
letter
on
the
eleventh
which
was
from
joanna
and
which
turned
her
thoughts
into
housewifely
channels
dear
miss
it
began
in
a
cramped
hand
upon
a
large
sheet
of
ruled
paper
i
suppose
you
would
like
to
know
what
has
been
done
about
the
house
cleaning
you
wrote
me
to
wate
till
you
come
but
i
never
like
to
wate
later
than
march
and
so
i
did
what
was
nesessary
myself
peice
by
peice
as
i
could
find
time
max
and
alec
and
bob
seemed
to
think
the
house
did
need
cleaning
but
jarvis
being
used
to
my
ways
and
his
mothers
said
you
would
want
it
right
he
spared
me
jake
kelly
to
clean
the
rugs
and
peices
of
carpet
and
i
did
the
rest
i
think
there
is
no
dirt
in
the
house
now
fireplaces
makes
lots
of
dust
but
i
should
say
the
way
they
are
enjoyed
makes
up
for
it
i
have
tryed
to
do
as
you
wanted
about
the
pillows
and
apples
and
good
food
and
i
think
the
young
gentlemen
are
any
liter
in
wate
than
when
you
went
away
hoping
you
will
come
home
soon
respectfully
yours
joanna
marshfield
nobody
but
a
housekeeper
and
a
young
one
at
that
could
appreciate
what
a
load
of
anxiety
this
letter
lifted
from
sally
mind
she
wanted
to
have
the
house
immaculately
clean
but
the
garden
was
waiting
for
her
now
she
could
give
her
undivided
thought
to
plans
for
the
beds
blessing
joanna
for
a
of
priceless
value
mrs
ferry
letter
arriving
on
the
thirteenth
made
sally
smile
with
the
lilt
of
its
lines
come
sally
dear
the
spring
is
here
the
air
is
mild
and
warm
showers
happen
by
but
cause
no
sigh
they
needed
on
the
farm
the
garden
waits
and
stirs
and
shakes
the
sleep
from
out
its
eyes
and
gently
sets
the
violets
to
blooming
in
surprise
the
grass
grows
green
a
lark
is
seen
a
robin
calls
it
spring
and
everywhere
in
earth
and
air
rejoices
everything
we
want
you
near
we
need
you
here
to
share
each
day
delights
so
hasten
home
come
soon
dear
come
miss
you
so
o
sweet
little
lady
the
girl
thought
affectionately
to
take
the
trouble
to
think
it
out
in
rhyme
for
me
on
the
sixteenth
of
the
month
a
rather
interesting
coincidence
occurred
letters
from
donald
ferry
and
from
jarvis
burnside
arrived
on
that
day
sally
studied
the
superscriptions
with
interest
wondering
what
the
handwriting
might
have
indicated
to
her
of
the
character
of
the
writers
had
she
known
nothing
of
either
opening
the
envelopes
she
laid
the
sheets
side
by
side
jarvis
wrote
a
rather
small
but
very
black
and
regular
hand
the
result
being
serried
rows
marching
like
a
regiment
down
the
page
the
hand
of
the
man
who
is
accustomed
to
do
everything
in
an
orderly
and
masterful
way
and
who
can
no
more
allow
his
words
to
straggle
over
a
sheet
of
paper
than
he
can
permit
his
books
to
stand
upside
down
upon
the
shelf
or
the
affairs
of
his
life
to
fall
into
confusion
ferry
wrote
a
more
dashing
hand
the
penmanship
of
the
man
whose
ideas
flow
faster
than
his
pen
can
put
the
words
upon
paper
and
who
cares
less
about
the
appearance
of
his
page
than
for
what
can
be
fixed
there
before
it
shall
escape
him
this
letter
therefore
appeared
less
easy
to
read
than
the
other
and
this
may
have
been
why
sally
attacked
it
first
dear
lady
of
the
garden
it
began
whimsically
i
am
sure
that
no
one
has
told
you
and
that
no
one
will
tell
you
unless
i
do
that
the
chickweed
is
looking
exceedingly
fresh
and
between
the
further
a
patch
of
small
white
violets
is
to
be
discovered
in
the
sunny
spots
beyond
the
sweet
pea
trellis
i
have
a
bunch
of
them
pinned
on
my
coat
at
this
moment
purloined
by
my
own
hand
and
smelling
like
spring
itself
the
daffodils
are
gorgeous
and
a
small
blue
flower
which
gives
forth
a
modest
and
unobtrusive
odour
all
its
own
is
to
be
found
in
clumps
in
several
places
alec
tells
me
he
has
written
you
all
about
the
progress
of
the
early
spring
work
but
you
may
possibly
be
still
more
interested
in
the
human
culture
going
on
upon
strawberry
acres
in
which
he
is
bearing
an
important
part
he
and
burnside
protected
by
blue
jeans
and
looking
highly
disreputable
have
been
spraying
the
apple
orchard
a
disagreeable
job
it
looks
to
be
from
the
standpoint
of
cleanliness
although
a
necessary
one
but
whenever
i
appeared
as
an
interested
spectator
on
the
scene
alec
was
toiling
away
with
the
greatest
good
humour
which
did
not
fail
him
when
the
apparatus
suddenly
stopped
working
properly
and
had
to
be
nursed
and
tended
through
at
least
the
final
third
of
the
operation
i
believe
your
brother
max
is
beginning
to
long
to
leave
the
bank
and
to
begin
his
life
upon
the
farm
in
spite
of
his
somewhat
satirical
comments
upon
the
probable
folly
of
alec
having
taken
this
step
i
am
confident
he
himself
would
like
to
try
it
another
spring
will
see
him
burning
his
bridges
or
i
am
no
prophet
no
one
miss
sally
could
be
thrown
as
your
brothers
are
with
such
a
fellow
as
jarvis
burnside
without
being
stimulated
to
action
he
is
the
most
thoroughly
alive
recent
college
graduate
i
know
of
in
any
line
of
work
it
a
refreshing
sight
to
me
to
see
a
man
with
all
the
instincts
for
a
literary
life
but
handicapped
by
the
necessity
for
taking
care
of
his
eyesight
throw
himself
with
such
ardour
into
labour
which
would
have
seemed
the
very
last
he
would
have
been
likely
to
care
for
on
my
word
i
do
know
when
i
admire
him
most
when
in
his
careful
dress
he
sits
down
to
his
books
and
journals
in
the
evening
getting
alec
to
read
aloud
to
him
when
he
has
reached
the
limit
of
safety
for
his
own
eyes
talking
to
the
lad
in
a
way
to
wake
the
boy
up
as
he
is
most
certainly
doing
or
when
i
see
him
at
such
a
job
as
he
tackled
putting
into
it
the
care
and
precision
of
your
true
scientist
and
experimenter
with
intent
to
get
the
full
result
of
the
best
directed
effort
possible
wherever
you
put
him
he
a
man
worth
knowing
and
i
glad
i
know
him
and
have
him
for
a
friend
i
like
to
hear
one
man
praise
another
like
that
commented
sally
to
herself
as
having
finished
the
letter
which
recounted
briefly
what
mrs
ferry
and
janet
were
doing
and
conveyed
messages
from
both
she
turned
back
to
the
whole
then
she
took
up
jarvis
letter
wondering
if
he
might
chance
to
refer
to
donald
ferry
in
as
high
terms
as
those
in
which
he
had
himself
been
mentioned
jarvis
had
a
crisp
clear
style
of
composition
all
his
own
the
letter
was
not
a
long
one
but
it
brought
the
writer
vividly
before
his
reader
dear
sally
one
of
the
fires
you
like
so
well
is
blazing
on
the
hearth
across
the
table
in
the
lamplight
sits
alec
absorbed
in
a
column
of
experiences
in
strawberry
culture
contributed
by
experts
from
all
parts
of
the
country
you
may
not
readily
believe
me
but
in
a
quite
upright
position
on
the
end
of
the
couch
where
the
firelight
illumines
the
page
max
is
deep
in
a
concise
and
practical
treatise
on
the
same
subject
bob
stands
on
the
hearth
rug
drying
out
after
a
run
home
from
the
ferry
cottage
through
a
brisk
shower
so
you
have
us
is
it
a
satisfactory
picture
according
to
alec
you
have
been
told
all
our
plans
for
the
season
and
ferry
said
that
he
meant
soon
to
write
you
precisely
what
is
happening
in
your
garden
if
he
does
you
will
have
a
masterpiece
of
a
description
for
he
a
writer
of
distinction
he
everything
else
that
worth
while
as
well
by
the
way
the
finest
ever
i
never
liked
a
man
so
well
with
so
good
reason
other
men
say
the
same
sort
of
thing
of
him
but
i
fancy
i
am
getting
to
know
and
appreciate
him
better
then
most
before
i
forget
it
joanna
wishes
me
to
state
that
she
has
spoken
for
a
kitchen
garden
which
shall
contain
parsley
lettuces
radishes
and
mint
with
bob
help
she
has
even
concocted
a
small
in
which
she
will
begin
operations
at
once
these
subjects
having
been
disposed
of
you
may
forgive
me
for
becoming
slightly
personal
do
you
know
that
you
have
answered
my
last
letter
i
had
one
sheet
from
you
in
january
one
in
early
march
and
a
a
week
ago
the
was
very
attractive
but
it
hardly
took
the
place
of
a
letter
was
it
intended
to
do
so
but
you
are
coming
home
soon
and
you
must
expect
to
answer
these
questions
for
me
then
i
assure
you
there
are
long
arrears
for
you
to
make
up
with
us
all
in
one
way
and
another
bob
is
counting
the
days
till
your
return
max
has
reached
the
limit
of
his
patience
alec
declares
this
thing
must
never
happen
again
joanna
but
it
would
be
a
breach
of
confidence
to
reveal
joanna
feelings
there
na
luck
aboot
the
hoose
she
is
confident
with
its
mistress
away
as
for
me
do
you
care
to
know
how
i
feel
about
your
coming
home
but
i
would
rather
tell
you
that
than
write
it
you
have
kept
me
at
length
all
winter
wo
you
just
bend
your
rigid
little
elbow
a
trifle
at
the
joint
when
you
shake
hands
with
me
the
first
of
may
as
ever
i
am
yours
jarvis
it
remained
for
max
to
put
the
crowning
touch
to
sally
rather
complicated
thoughts
about
going
home
with
the
following
characteristic
communication
dear
sister
this
thing
is
played
out
i
want
you
to
understand
that
the
first
of
may
is
the
first
of
may
and
you
are
to
get
here
on
it
not
leave
there
that
day
nor
the
day
after
bachelors
hall
is
well
enough
in
its
way
but
not
for
a
lifetime
you
better
be
on
hand
mighty
soon
and
sudden
if
you
want
to
keep
to
yourself
running
you
a
close
second
and
she
liable
to
pass
you
in
sight
of
the
wire
take
a
brother
advice
i
do
suppose
either
of
them
has
written
you
a
word
about
the
other
but
if
they
have
that
just
as
bad
a
sign
as
if
they
kept
you
in
full
knowledge
of
the
way
they
get
on
like
a
basket
of
chips
come
home
come
home

round
the
corner
joanna
marshfield
left
alone
in
charge
of
the
house
at
strawberry
acres
on
the
evening
of
the
of
april
stood
in
the
front
doorway
looking
out
into
the
rain
the
air
was
mild
but
like
a
wet
sponge
in
the
feel
of
it
against
her
cheek
i
hope
to
goodness
clear
off
before
the
folks
come
said
she
to
herself
here
burnside
coming
out
most
a
month
sooner
than
she
wanted
to
and
miss
sally
looking
forward
to
seeing
things
well
under
way
in
that
old
garden
she
sets
such
store
by
if
may
day
would
just
be
nice
and
sunshiny
for
all
please
me
well
now
who
can
that
be
a
figure
was
approaching
on
the
carrying
an
umbrella
and
a
tag
and
walking
rapidly
as
it
neared
joanna
could
see
in
the
light
thrown
out
from
the
hallway
and
the
front
windows
that
the
figure
wore
skirts
of
dark
blue
the
next
instant
the
umbrella
was
tilted
back
at
a
reckless
angle
and
a
voice
called
guardedly
out
of
the
mist
o
joanna
is
that
you
hush
do
answer
out
loud
miss
sally
joanna
amazed
crossed
the
porch
to
meet
her
young
mistress
who
ever
have
thought
of
seeing
you
why
we
was
expecting
you
till
day
after
and
where
mr
rudd
joanna
dear
do
speak
so
loud
i
want
to
surprise
them
came
back
the
laughing
whisper
and
the
next
minute
sally
bag
and
umbrella
were
on
the
porch
and
she
was
wringing
both
her
housekeeper
plump
hands
in
her
own
how
do
you
do
joanna
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
uncle
timothy
stopped
off
for
a
week
in
washington
and
i
could
wait
so
came
on
alone
is
everybody
well
they
well
enough
miss
sally
but
you
be
pretty
disappointed
you
see
they
was
expecting
you
so
oh
are
they
they
ca
be
away
where
are
they
well
you
see
they
was
getting
sort
of
restless
waiting
for
the
first
of
may
and
max
took
them
into
town
to
some
show
it
too
bad
they
rather
have
seen
you
than
any
show
i
reckon
but
they
be
back
i
expect
they
will
near
eleven
oh
well
i
can
wait
sally
drew
a
long
breath
i
waited
months
i
can
stand
it
a
few
hours
longer
it
a
shame
joanna
picked
up
the
bag
and
umbrella
and
led
the
way
into
the
hall
the
burnsides
are
coming
the
day
after
she
pointed
toward
the
open
door
into
the
west
wing
the
hall
light
shining
in
a
short
distance
among
the
shadows
and
showing
a
room
in
order
awful
too
bad
they
did
get
here
never
mind
it
a
great
deal
just
to
be
at
home
again
how
pleasant
it
all
looks
and
how
fresh
joanna
led
on
into
the
long
where
a
light
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
it
as
fresh
as
i
could
make
it
she
admitted
but
some
ways
it
can
be
made
fresher
that
you
see
right
away
them
red
pillows
evidently
the
pillows
had
been
on
joanna
mind
ever
since
she
had
been
put
in
charge
of
them
upon
sally
departure
sally
gave
them
one
glance
and
burst
into
appreciative
laughter
joanna
and
being
sat
on
around
the
fire
and
used
for
acrobatic
performances
yes
i
see
i
them
right
away
do
it
while
i
wait
if
i
had
the
stuff
if
i
could
sit
still
long
enough
i
want
to
go
all
over
the
house
and
if
it
was
raining
i
go
out
in
the
garden
and
through
the
pine
grove
and
over
into
the
orchard
oh
here
a
new
picture
of
alec
on
the
why
did
he
send
it
to
me
i
could
go
over
and
let
the
ferry
people
know
you
here
suggested
joanna
watching
sally
eye
the
small
likeness
hungrily
so
that
it
seemed
a
matter
of
charity
to
present
some
human
creature
to
her
gaze
no
no
thank
you
i
rather
see
my
own
family
first
i
can
wait
i
go
up
and
get
off
these
travelling
things
and
unpack
my
bag
that
will
take
up
a
little
time
and
sally
prepared
to
put
her
suggestion
into
action
just
let
me
go
up
first
miss
sally
urged
joanna
not
expecting
you
so
soon
the
room
no
linen
in
it
it
wo
look
like
home
to
you
i
wo
be
ten
minutes
it
too
bad
miss
josephine
was
going
to
have
the
house
all
trimmed
up
with
flowers
for
you
seeing
that
to
refuse
to
allow
this
would
disappoint
joanna
sally
submitted
and
went
out
to
the
open
front
door
again
to
stand
looking
off
into
the
wet
night
where
a
row
of
distant
lights
glimmering
vaguely
through
the
mist
outlined
the
course
of
the
trolley
connecting
wybury
with
the
city
anyhow
i
at
home
she
consoled
herself
i
might
be
content
with
that
for
an
hour
or
two
but
it
does
seem
as
if
i
could
never
wait
if
i
could
only
see
my
garden
she
went
to
the
end
of
the
porch
and
tried
to
make
out
some
sign
that
would
indicate
its
presence
but
the
mist
was
too
thick
yet
the
light
from
the
windows
shone
directly
down
that
way
i
believe
if
i
were
out
there
i
could
see
something
she
reflected
i
going
to
change
my
clothes
i
might
as
well
soak
them
a
little
more
she
ran
back
into
the
hall
caught
up
her
blue
coat
and
pulling
it
on
flew
out
again
and
plunged
off
the
porch
into
the
darkness
the
april
rain
more
mist
than
drops
falling
on
her
fair
curls
the
grass
was
long
and
wet
but
she
cared
for
nothing
now
and
dashed
on
till
she
came
to
the
first
lying
distinct
in
one
of
the
shafts
of
light
from
the
windows
hunting
expectantly
about
she
explored
the
whole
garden
laughing
softly
to
herself
at
the
absurdity
of
the
performance
for
she
was
growing
wetter
every
minute
she
felt
of
the
ground
where
she
could
not
see
it
exulting
in
the
discovery
of
ranks
of
tulips
where
she
had
planted
their
bulbs
last
fall
just
breaking
into
bud
you
dear
things
she
said
under
her
breath
how
enchanting
of
you
to
be
out
to
welcome
me
home
when
you
had
never
met
me
before
over
there
the
sweet
pea
trellis
i
wonder
if
bob
put
the
seeds
in
as
i
wrote
him
can
i
tell
by
the
feel
of
the
ground
oh
the
light
falls
there
i
can
see
she
was
so
absorbed
in
this
entertaining
exploration
that
she
did
not
hear
the
distant
closing
of
a
door
beyond
the
pine
grove
nor
the
footsteps
which
presently
came
that
way
and
paused
just
beyond
the
orchard
neither
did
she
guess
at
the
quiet
approach
of
a
tall
figure
through
the
mist
until
it
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
garden
the
first
she
knew
of
its
presence
was
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
speaking
quietly
so
that
it
might
not
startle
her
yet
with
a
note
of
joy
plainly
perceptible
through
its
control
can
i
believe
my
eyes
or
am
i
dreaming
that
i
see
you
sally
lane
oh
jarvis
the
cry
was
a
startled
one
in
spite
of
his
precaution
then
the
blue
figure
flew
toward
the
gray
one
in
the
shadow
both
hands
out
as
sally
forgot
everything
except
that
here
at
last
was
one
who
seemed
to
belong
to
her
own
household
my
dear
girl
when
did
you
come
have
we
missed
getting
a
message
jarvis
meeting
her
more
than
half
way
held
the
small
hands
tight
stooping
to
try
to
see
into
her
face
no
no
i
did
send
any
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
all
uncle
tim
decided
to
stop
off
in
washington
for
a
week
and
i
could
bear
to
wait
he
is
perfectly
well
now
and
said
i
might
come
on
so
i
came
i
never
dreamed
that
every
one
would
be
away
it
a
confounded
mischance
his
lips
said
heartily
but
his
thoughts
added
everybody
but
he
went
on
quickly
you
must
stay
out
here
how
long
have
you
been
out
he
touched
her
hair
why
soaking
wet
come
in
child
he
kept
firm
hold
of
one
hand
and
drew
her
with
him
in
a
rapid
progress
to
the
porch
the
moment
the
light
fell
on
her
face
he
was
expectantly
studying
it
and
when
he
had
her
in
the
hall
under
the
stronger
rays
he
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
as
if
he
wanted
to
make
up
for
months
of
deprivation
she
turned
a
rosy
red
under
his
scrutiny
her
cheeks
looking
like
moist
but
vivid
flowers
drops
of
rain
sparkling
in
her
hair
and
clinging
even
to
her
lashes
come
in
by
the
fire
and
dry
your
hair
he
commanded
she
shook
her
head
and
drew
away
her
hand
no
i
run
up
and
dry
everything
at
once
you
wo
be
all
the
evening
about
it
he
questioned
with
suspicion
for
her
attitude
suggested
flight
how
can
i
tell
the
old
mischief
looked
out
of
her
eyes
he
took
a
step
toward
her
come
and
get
the
first
wet
off
by
the
fire
he
urged
but
laughing
she
fled
up
the
stairs
i
did
know
he
was
such
a
person
she
was
owning
to
herself
as
she
ran
along
the
upper
hall
why
he
grown
so
much
heavier
and
handsomer
i
actually
afraid
of
him
it
does
seem
like
the
same
jarvis
burnside
i
known
so
long
he
he
what
dorothy
chase
would
call
stunning
i
never
supposed
that
farming
would
have
that
effect
on
anybody
then
she
rushed
into
her
own
room
to
find
it
in
spotless
order
with
evidences
of
joanna
recent
presence
in
a
brisk
little
fire
burning
in
the
small
bedroom
fireplace
the
freshest
of
appointments
everywhere
and
a
trimly
bright
lamp
upon
the
old
cherry
which
had
come
from
new
hampshire
among
uncle
timothy
furniture
my
trunk
is
here
what
in
the
world
shall
i
put
on
was
her
first
anxiety
she
opened
the
door
of
her
closet
to
find
all
her
last
summer
frocks
newly
done
up
and
hanging
there
in
inviting
daintiness
she
caught
at
the
lilac
muslin
now
faded
by
many
washings
into
a
mere
tint
but
looking
so
like
home
and
good
times
that
it
seemed
the
fitting
thing
to
don
in
the
absence
of
her
heavier
dresses
even
upon
an
april
night
a
later
her
hair
crisply
dried
by
the
fire
and
curling
blithely
from
its
recent
bath
herself
sweet
with
the
and
freshness
which
is
the
only
fragrance
worth
cultivating
sally
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
peeped
down
she
beheld
jarvis
pacing
up
and
down
the
hall
and
as
she
looked
saw
him
take
his
watch
out
and
scan
its
face
as
if
he
had
an
appointment
to
keep
she
stood
still
her
pulses
beating
rather
quickly
this
was
not
exactly
the
sort
of
she
had
planned
this
reception
by
one
person
but
it
was
nearly
ten
already
she
had
managed
to
consume
so
much
time
upstairs
also
upon
joanna
return
to
her
room
to
inquire
if
there
were
anything
else
she
wanted
the
young
mistress
of
the
house
had
imperatively
commanded
the
presence
in
the
of
the
housekeeper
until
such
time
as
max
and
the
boys
should
arrive
joanna
with
her
neat
black
dress
and
smooth
hair
was
certainly
fitted
in
appearance
for
the
duties
of
duenna
and
sally
had
felt
no
hesitation
whatever
in
requiring
her
to
assume
that
rôle
so
joanna
now
waited
in
the
rather
reluctantly
it
must
be
admitted
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
was
carrying
chaperonage
unnecessarily
far
but
jarvis
was
in
the
hall
and
the
door
had
been
closed
between
sally
did
not
realize
this
latter
fact
until
she
had
almost
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
where
jarvis
the
moment
that
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
had
advanced
to
meet
her
she
looked
at
the
door
with
a
startled
expression
it
was
ordinarily
kept
open
except
in
very
cold
weather
yes
i
know
it
shut
said
the
young
man
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
with
a
smile
awful
situation
is
it
but
you
can
escape
back
up
the
stairs
if
you
are
quick
i
warn
you
that
you
have
to
be
very
quick
will
you
give
me
sixty
seconds
start
not
i
you
had
five
months
start
that
enough
now
you
are
back
how
well
you
are
looking
she
stood
still
two
steps
above
him
even
so
she
had
not
much
the
advantage
of
him
in
height
so
are
you
she
retorted
but
we
do
need
to
stay
out
here
to
tell
each
other
that
let
are
you
so
eager
to
see
joanna
again
she
looking
very
well
also
for
joanna
but
she
can
wait
a
minute
or
two
to
hear
it
joanna
has
been
so
good
she
cleaned
the
whole
house
for
me
she
i
know
she
a
treasure
but
i
have
time
to
think
about
her
now
all
i
can
think
of
is
that
i
looking
at
you
again
i
told
you
in
my
last
letter
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
i
felt
about
your
coming
home
do
you
care
to
know
are
you
really
glad
sally
tried
to
ask
it
as
she
would
have
done
a
year
ago
in
the
old
friendly
time
when
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
she
and
jarvis
should
be
glad
to
see
each
other
am
i
what
do
you
think
i
should
be
very
disappointed
if
you
were
not
of
course
i
want
everybody
to
welcome
me
home
i
missed
it
so
but
you
still
do
want
the
welcoming
done
and
sally
it
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
am
i
never
to
come
to
one
i
not
a
very
lane
expostulated
the
girl
laughter
on
her
lips
but
her
eyes
shy
that
may
be
but
though
you
have
so
many
turnings
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
kept
a
good
while
on
the
straight
stretch
what
if
you
should
let
me
see
just
a
little
way
round
the
corner
you
know
what
i
want
to
find
there
you
know
how
dearly
i
love
you
there
was
a
moment
silence
will
you
be
contented
to
see
a
very
little
way
i
ca
promise
to
be
contented
but
i
agree
to
be
patient
if
i
can
get
even
a
glimpse
of
where
my
lane
may
lead
in
the
end
sally
tried
to
look
frankly
at
him
in
the
old
way
it
proved
less
easy
than
she
would
have
supposed
his
whole
personality
seemed
to
have
grown
so
dominant
so
compelling
she
put
out
one
hand
he
grasped
it
eagerly
and
would
have
drawn
her
down
to
where
he
stood
but
she
prevented
this
with
a
warning
gesture
no
no
she
said
quickly
it
only
round
the
corner
you
to
look
that
only
means
i
willing
to
be
very
good
friends
better
than
we
have
been
perhaps
i
do
want
to
be
tied
by
any
promises
i
want
to
be
a
girl
yet
only
not
perhaps
quite
so
little
a
girl
as
before
meanwhile
you
not
tied
either
a
short
laugh
interrupted
her
there
nothing
on
earth
i
should
like
so
much
there
such
a
lovely
girl
next
door
i
heard
what
have
you
heard
sally
did
not
seem
to
be
willing
to
tell
it
makes
no
difference
what
you
heard
ask
her
herself
what
we
talked
of
most
but
sally
how
long
before
i
may
see
round
another
corner
she
hesitated
i
do
know
not
this
year
please
not
this
year
well
i
certainly
shall
have
to
cultivate
patience
but
i
will
if
i
must
when
her
lips
twitched
a
little
it
was
the
girl
he
had
known
a
long
time
who
answered
when
the
first
strawberries
go
to
market
from
strawberry
acres
shades
of
job
a
year
from
this
june
and
till
then
i
must
walk
on
neutral
ground
it
was
harder
to
resist
him
harder
to
put
him
off
than
she
had
thought
it
would
be
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
and
when
sally
lane
did
that
she
could
not
be
easily
swayed
from
her
purpose
you
seen
around
the
corner
she
murmured
you
promised
to
be
content
with
that
not
content
patient
if
i
can
i
will
be
thank
you
for
that
much
he
reluctantly
let
her
draw
away
her
hand
and
she
came
down
the
two
steps
passed
him
and
led
the
way
toward
the
door
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
he
stopped
her
sally
yes
i
ca
help
liking
the
look
of
the
lane
beyond
the
corner
laughing
and
blushing
more
brilliantly
than
before
which
was
rather
superfluous
sally
threw
open
the
door
regardless
of
the
fact
that
joanna
who
possessed
a
pair
of
very
good
eyes
was
awaiting
her
in
the
room
beyond
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
dazzling
people
eyesight
so
that
they
can
not
judge
perfectly
of
what
they
see
and
this
effect
joanna
mistress
immediately
proceeded
to
produce
for
the
following
hour
between
raptures
over
being
at
home
tales
of
her
southern
experiences
told
so
vividly
that
her
listeners
seemed
to
see
them
for
themselves
eager
questionings
of
the
home
stayers
there
was
small
chance
for
anybody
to
put
a
finger
upon
exactly
what
miss
sally
inmost
thoughts
might
be
then
quite
unexpectedly
a
quarter
hour
earlier
than
it
had
been
supposed
possible
the
tramp
of
feet
was
heard
upon
the
porch
sally
flew
toward
the
hall
then
flew
back
again
leaving
the
door
closed
and
standing
still
and
breathless
upon
the
in
the
full
light
of
the
fire
voices
were
heard
in
the
hall
and
the
rattle
of
umbrellas
in
the
rack
plaguey
poor
play
max
was
complaining
rather
stay
by
the
fire
any
night
than
poke
to
town
to
bore
myself
like
that
i
do
think
he
flung
open
the
door
behind
him
alec
voice
was
saying
i
as
wet
as
a
rat
you
fellows
had
the
big
umbrella
the
little
one
is
big
enough
to
well
i
be
max
exclamation
cut
his
brother
short
he
stood
still
staring
there
was
a
flutter
of
lilac
skirts
a
low
cry
of
joy
and
jarvis
was
looking
on
enviously
at
an
illustration
of
the
privileges
that
exist
for
brothers
who
stupid
fellows
do
not
half
appreciate
them
a
moment
later
alec
and
bob
had
come
in
for
their
share
of
sisterly
greeting
and
the
three
were
standing
round
the
returned
traveller
in
a
highly
satisfied
putting
questions
making
comments
and
generally
behaving
as
they
might
have
been
counted
on
to
do
i
hope
you
do
expect
us
to
believe
those
piteous
tales
about
your
losing
flesh
and
colour
with
homesickness
declared
max
his
hand
on
his
sister
shoulder
as
he
turned
her
full
toward
the
firelight
jove
i
never
saw
you
look
more
like
one
of
those
pink
peonies
you
think
so
much
of
in
your
garden
i
did
write
piteous
tales
his
sister
involuntarily
accentuated
the
likeness
he
had
suggested
by
growing
pinker
than
before
it
was
uncle
tim
then
he
got
worried
about
you
and
wrote
me
so
he
must
have
been
off
his
base
you
never
looked
healthier
but
see
here
miss
you
do
do
this
thing
again
understand
we
never
keep
house
here
another
winter
without
you
sally
had
come
home
on
saturday
night
on
sunday
morning
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
before
breakfast
she
was
out
in
the
garden
spying
her
there
as
he
looked
out
of
his
window
max
hastened
his
dressing
and
went
out
to
join
her
looks
fairly
well
in
order
eh
he
questioned
sally
remembered
certain
information
sent
her
in
one
of
janet
letters
indeed
it
does
and
you
made
it
so
that
pleases
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
max
how
do
you
know
i
did
guessed
it
from
your
expression
and
a
hint
i
had
had
did
you
rather
enjoy
doing
it
much
more
than
i
should
have
expected
he
was
forced
to
admit
under
the
scrutiny
of
her
eyes
how
i
wish
you
could
leave
the
bank
and
join
the
boys
in
the
work
out
here
do
you
almost
wish
so
yourself
she
demanded
thrusting
her
hand
through
his
arm
as
he
paced
along
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
old
garden
paths
were
quite
wide
enough
for
two
when
they
walked
close
together
max
looked
down
at
her
to
tell
the
truth
i
beginning
to
wish
so
too
this
from
max
was
a
great
admission
sally
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
oh
ca
you
she
cried
i
do
see
how
i
can
this
year
to
be
sure
jarve
paying
all
the
expenses
and
taking
all
the
responsibility
these
first
two
years
according
to
agreement
but
i
ca
lie
down
on
him
of
course
it
all
outgo
and
no
income
until
we
get
the
strawberries
to
bearing
next
year
meanwhile
the
family
has
to
be
supported
and
what
timber
we
thought
best
to
sell
wo
do
that
if
all
of
us
stop
work
it
all
right
for
al
and
bob
to
spend
this
season
on
the
farm
for
jarve
would
have
to
hire
somebody
anyway
but
it
different
with
me
and
my
salary
is
more
than
they
could
earn
both
together
at
their
old
jobs
no
i
must
grind
away
another
year
but
then
then
you
come
yes
and
be
glad
to
i
so
delighted
to
hear
you
say
that
i
need
the
change
i
realize
at
last
what
a
bear
i
been
these
three
years
i
tired
of
being
a
bear
it
half
nerves
i
believe
but
a
fellow
of
my
age
ought
not
to
know
he
has
nerves
besides
he
paused
looking
off
through
the
pine
grove
to
the
gap
in
the
hedge
through
which
a
glimpse
of
the
white
cottage
could
be
had
sally
waited
it
was
rarely
that
her
elder
brother
became
confidential
and
this
mood
seemed
more
than
ordinarily
propitious
for
getting
at
his
best
thoughts
after
a
little
he
went
on
in
a
firm
tone
speaking
after
a
fashion
which
made
his
sister
feel
for
him
a
new
respect
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
in
a
way
i
think
i
rather
a
different
fellow
from
the
one
you
left
last
november
i
see
things
differently
it
his
doing
he
nodded
toward
the
cottage
and
sally
understood
also
she
felt
infinitely
thankful
to
the
influence
which
had
brought
about
this
change
i
come
to
see
he
went
on
more
slowly
what
it
means
to
have
a
definite
purpose
in
life
beyond
merely
making
a
living
and
having
as
much
of
a
good
time
as
you
can
manage
to
extract
i
want
to
make
a
man
of
myself
the
sort
of
man
my
maker
intended
me
to
be
ferry
doing
it
jarvis
is
doing
it
even
alec
and
bob
put
me
to
shame
with
the
manliness
they
developing
if
maxwell
lane
swing
into
line
he
can
dear
he
will
he
swung
already
when
he
can
talk
like
this
his
sister
hand
squeezed
his
arm
tight
for
a
minute
in
her
happiness
it
not
going
to
be
a
matter
of
talk
mind
you
he
said
earnestly
don
ferry
does
talk
about
his
own
life
he
lives
it
i
want
to
do
the
same
but
i
felt
as
if
i
like
you
to
know
that
all
what
that
coming
up
in
the
corner
there
they
almost
ready
to
bud
and
sally
let
him
lead
the
conversation
away
from
himself
to
talk
about
the
garden
understanding
that
the
little
revelation
was
a
great
one
for
him
to
make
and
that
it
had
cost
him
a
decided
effort
but
while
she
talked
of
the
pruning
of
the
roses
and
the
prospects
of
the
sweet
peas
just
sown
her
heart
was
rejoicing
over
the
growth
in
this
human
garden
as
ferry
had
called
it
so
much
dearer
to
her
alec
to
go
away
next
winter
for
a
course
at
an
agricultural
school
max
announced
suddenly
i
made
up
my
mind
to
that
he
shows
more
bent
than
any
of
us
toward
making
a
science
of
this
thing
odd
it
where
you
consider
how
set
he
was
against
even
living
here
i
tell
you
don
ferry
a
great
chap
he
done
more
for
us
than
we
can
pay
back
i
like
to
keep
him
in
the
family
janet
too
see
here
he
rose
upright
from
having
stooped
over
certain
newly
upspringing
shoots
and
favoured
his
sister
with
a
sharp
glance
what
the
matter
with
you
and
don
hitting
it
off
that
would
leave
jarve
to
janet
and
make
a
mighty
nice
combination
of
us
eh
judging
by
appearances
don
would
object
a
i
say
where
are
you
going
did
you
hear
the
sally
was
walking
away
from
him
toward
the
house
no
i
did
neither
did
you
but
sally
continued
to
walk
regardless
of
the
fact
that
both
alec
and
bob
had
appeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
coming
toward
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
their
sunday
trousers
feet
treading
gingerly
over
the
damp
grass
in
their
best
shoes
on
whatever
part
of
strawberry
acres
sally
should
be
descried
it
might
be
safely
prophesied
that
there
her
family
would
be
likely
to
foregather
chapter
xx
green
leaves
so
the
great
day
has
come
at
last
my
word
but
you
had
the
courage
of
your
convictions
what
a
stretch
of
of
convictions
well
they
certainly
embodied
in
those
seven
acres
whether
there
are
any
strawberries
there
or
not
do
you
want
to
get
over
the
fence
and
stroll
up
one
of
the
rows
you
may
find
a
specimen
or
two
of
fruit
worth
setting
your
teeth
into
neil
chase
correctly
clad
in
light
flannels
eyed
the
fence
critically
before
he
clambered
over
it
i
can
be
trusted
to
tear
myself
if
a
twopenny
splinter
anywhere
said
he
must
admit
it
looks
rather
worth
while
over
here
though
hello
dorothy
over
already
who
that
assisting
her
the
reverend
donald
in
blue
overalls
it
lucky
old
dutch
ca
see
him
now
i
say
you
got
a
lot
of
pickers
are
they
all
members
of
the
firm
jarvis
laughed
as
he
followed
chase
glance
up
the
rows
struck
us
on
our
first
day
he
admitted
we
agreed
to
make
it
a
special
celebration
among
ourselves
since
only
a
small
part
of
the
berries
are
ripe
the
pink
covers
an
acquaintance
then
inferred
neil
watching
it
approach
from
a
distance
hello
it
sally
and
he
pulled
off
his
hat
to
wave
it
in
response
to
a
salutation
from
the
pink
whose
removal
had
disclosed
a
fair
head
whose
locks
the
june
sunshine
was
turning
into
gold
i
suppose
the
blue
one
conceals
jo
burnside
the
white
one
miss
ferry
and
so
forth
i
always
said
you
people
were
no
farmers
to
dress
for
the
part
like
stage
he
added
as
sally
came
within
hearing
why
not
could
any
stage
be
set
to
equal
this
one
inquired
sally
lane
no
no
you
ca
shake
hands
with
me
she
held
up
ten
fingers
what
could
be
more
appropriate
for
picking
strawberries
than
a
pink
gingham
it
mighty
becoming
anyhow
neil
offered
tribute
jove
sally
but
farming
certainly
does
agree
with
you
talk
of
roses
dorothy
he
called
come
here
and
look
at
these
cheeks
full
in
the
sunlight
too
i
wager
yours
could
stand
such
a
test
sally
promptly
put
on
her
a
strawberry
patch
is
no
place
for
flattery
neil
chase
said
she
come
with
me
dorothy
i
show
you
the
biggest
berry
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
and
you
may
eat
it
too
chase
gathered
her
white
skirts
about
her
planted
her
feet
recklessly
in
the
wake
of
sally
and
arrived
in
due
time
at
the
point
where
sally
had
been
picking
from
nearby
rows
josephine
burnside
janet
ferry
and
constance
carew
lifted
heads
to
greet
her
how
awfully
busy
you
all
are
cried
dorothy
consuming
a
fat
berry
with
which
sally
presented
her
too
busy
to
greet
your
friends
this
is
a
reception
it
a
working
affair
janet
replied
gayly
guests
may
help
themselves
to
refreshments
but
must
expect
the
hostesses
to
stop
picking
you
have
no
trouble
about
getting
the
men
at
your
entertainments
sally
observed
dorothy
scanning
the
field
they
all
here
i
see
even
max
has
he
left
the
bank
yes
the
first
of
may
this
is
our
third
season
you
know
but
the
first
one
of
bearing
max
is
as
enthusiastic
as
anybody
now
when
you
see
him
nearer
you
discover
a
great
change
in
him
no
more
banks
for
him
if
we
can
make
anything
like
a
success
with
the
strawberries
how
do
you
know
that
you
will
you
such
amateurs
at
it
we
not
if
study
of
the
subject
amounts
to
anything
sally
asserted
with
a
little
air
of
pride
between
books
and
experiment
stations
and
alec
course
at
an
agricultural
school
last
winter
and
jarvis
visits
to
practical
it
would
be
strange
if
our
methods
went
all
astray
but
they
not
going
astray
look
at
these
berries
you
eating
down
the
rows
jarvis
was
pursuing
much
the
same
line
of
argument
with
neil
chase
it
not
in
reason
you
know
the
visitor
objected
critically
selecting
choice
specimens
of
fruit
along
the
rows
and
eating
them
with
evident
relish
it
not
in
reason
for
a
lot
of
fellows
like
you
fresh
from
books
and
banks
to
jump
into
this
sort
of
thing
and
make
it
go
without
a
hitch
well
you
have
the
evidence
of
your
eyes
before
you
jarvis
returned
with
great
good
humour
from
his
knees
among
the
vines
where
he
was
now
picking
busily
again
to
be
sure
it
has
gone
without
a
hitch
last
season
we
had
a
long
spring
drought
to
fight
and
fought
it
too
with
irrigation
this
spring
the
fungus
attacked
us
but
we
overcame
it
with
spraying
of
course
next
year
a
killing
frost
may
come
along
and
finish
the
crop
for
the
year
we
ca
fight
that
such
a
frost
is
to
be
reckoned
with
on
an
average
of
about
once
in
five
years
but
on
the
other
years
we
expect
to
make
up
do
you
think
we
can
get
our
prices
for
such
berries
as
these
and
will
you
tell
me
why
brains
even
amateur
ones
ca
solve
such
problems
as
we
have
to
face
you
lawyers
tackle
hard
cases
and
win
them
even
while
you
green
if
you
possess
certain
qualities
to
begin
with
we
may
be
conceited
but
we
have
an
idea
we
possess
the
qualities
necessary
to
successful
strawberry
culture
as
a
game
it
certainly
a
mighty
interesting
one
the
average
farmer
neil
argued
is
a
rich
experimenter
like
you
he
ca
afford
to
put
good
gold
into
fertilizers
and
irrigating
pumps
i
should
think
these
fellows
all
around
you
would
hate
you
for
having
the
advantage
of
them
on
the
contrary
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
but
one
or
two
are
our
very
good
friends
and
much
interested
in
our
schemes
they
given
us
a
lot
of
valuable
advice
not
on
strawberry
culture
because
that
not
in
their
line
but
in
other
ways
they
enjoy
our
mistakes
hugely
only
human
but
they
do
do
it
in
an
way
last
spring
when
we
sowed
for
millet
and
did
recognize
it
till
the
crop
appeared
it
was
worth
it
to
see
them
laugh
at
the
joke
particularly
as
we
did
mind
laughing
with
them
but
i
can
tell
you
where
we
scoring
the
biggest
success
after
all
the
one
that
would
pay
if
half
our
crops
turned
out
you
have
been
out
here
for
a
year
at
least
take
a
look
at
max
alec
and
bob
when
you
get
close
to
them
and
tell
me
if
they
look
like
the
same
chaps
you
used
to
know
in
town
you
do
yourself
admitted
chase
somewhat
grudgingly
he
himself
was
decidedly
slender
of
limb
much
to
his
regret
also
in
spite
of
incessant
motoring
his
face
was
not
that
of
unexceptionable
health
you
look
as
rugged
as
a
rock
never
thought
you
were
cut
out
for
an
athlete
either
when
you
were
in
college
i
rather
think
that
siege
with
my
eyes
was
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
though
it
did
seem
much
like
it
at
the
time
look
at
that
berry
he
held
out
a
fine
specimen
that
goes
in
class
a
specials
all
right
how
many
classes
do
you
have
neil
inquired
making
way
with
the
specimen
from
class
a
in
one
huge
mouthful
and
finding
it
so
juicy
he
was
forced
to
make
prompt
use
of
his
handkerchief
two
but
we
going
to
draw
a
strict
line
the
big
ones
are
to
be
big
to
the
bottom
of
the
basket
and
no
false
bottoms
a
reputation
is
what
we
after
then
the
prices
will
take
care
of
themselves
neil
strolled
down
the
row
he
had
information
enough
he
wanted
to
inspect
the
one
at
a
time
it
was
not
every
day
that
one
could
meet
distinguished
young
clergymen
accomplished
pianists
and
singers
of
unusual
promise
between
rows
of
strawberry
vines
the
chases
had
not
been
invited
to
be
present
at
this
special
celebration
of
the
first
day
of
the
strawberry
picking
but
they
unhesitatingly
accepted
the
invitation
to
stay
to
luncheon
offered
them
as
the
hour
for
that
meal
drew
near
when
the
party
left
the
field
for
the
house
it
was
discovered
that
joanna
assisted
by
burnside
and
mrs
ferry
had
moved
the
from
the
to
the
big
porch
well
of
all
the
romantic
impractical
farmers
ejaculated
neil
chase
as
he
beheld
this
arrangement
at
close
range
the
table
set
with
old
china
a
great
bowl
of
sally
pink
roses
in
the
centre
do
you
know
that
fried
and
potatoes
in
the
kitchen
in
your
is
your
only
consistent
meal
in
the
work
season
if
you
will
insist
on
our
living
up
to
your
notion
of
the
real
thing
we
can
set
a
special
table
for
you
in
the
kitchen
i
no
doubt
we
can
borrow
some
pork
somewhere
you
can
take
off
your
coat
and
eat
your
noon
meal
there
if
you
like
sustained
by
your
sense
of
what
is
fitting
offered
alec
as
for
me
i
going
in
to
wash
up
put
on
my
coat
and
eat
about
twelve
square
inches
of
the
building
for
this
table
there
wo
be
any
of
that
served
in
the
kitchen
i
warn
you
mr
chase
thank
you
i
not
pointing
out
my
course
of
action
but
criticizing
yours
retorted
neil
surveying
with
favour
a
platter
of
broiled
chicken
and
eyeing
hungrily
a
large
filled
with
a
compound
which
he
knew
by
experience
to
be
one
of
joanna
choicest
i
say
to
be
consistent
but
he
found
himself
delivering
his
views
to
burnside
alone
for
the
rest
had
trooped
in
to
make
themselves
presentable
you
people
certainly
do
manage
to
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
your
farming
observed
dorothy
chase
as
she
watched
sally
splashing
her
round
arms
in
a
vain
effort
to
remove
the
tan
we
live
just
as
far
out
from
town
as
you
do
but
nothing
could
be
more
different
than
our
way
of
living
from
yours
well
if
we
depended
on
tennis
golf
and
bridge
for
our
fun
we
be
just
like
you
as
we
like
hayfields
and
pine
groves
better
with
tobogganing
in
winter
we
continue
to
be
different
i
should
say
golf
and
tennis
were
just
as
healthy
exercise
as
haying
and
picking
strawberries
no
doubt
they
are
but
the
company
is
so
select
declared
sally
audaciously
towelling
her
wet
face
so
briskly
that
it
emerged
looking
more
than
ever
like
the
roses
to
which
neil
had
that
morning
compared
it
you
impertinent
girl
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
tom
westlake
is
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
same
breath
with
donald
ferry
billy
north
is
an
idiot
compared
with
jarvis
burnside
there
are
two
girls
among
all
your
society
friends
who
can
equal
janet
and
constance
and
and
sally
lane
as
a
hostess
is
infinitely
superior
to
dorothy
chase
do
put
words
into
my
mouth
sally
came
close
and
laid
a
warm
pink
palm
on
either
of
dorothy
cheeks
sally
lane
is
such
a
bad
hostess
she
says
insulting
things
to
her
guests
do
mind
her
she
so
excited
and
happy
over
her
strawberry
acres
she
not
responsible
for
what
she
says
come
let
hurry
down
you
people
look
more
like
a
set
of
golfers
at
a
summer
hotel
than
you
do
like
farmers
began
neil
chase
still
harping
on
the
theme
which
seemed
to
cause
him
so
much
unrest
as
the
party
sat
down
max
opened
his
mouth
for
a
retort
but
with
one
look
at
donald
ferry
who
sat
across
the
table
he
closed
it
again
he
met
an
amused
glance
of
comprehension
then
ferry
also
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
before
the
words
found
breath
timothy
rudd
rose
to
the
occasion
chase
said
he
since
a
rose
by
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
let
me
suggest
that
you
call
us
strawberry
gardeners
not
that
we
object
in
the
least
to
being
called
farmers
for
we
consider
the
title
one
of
honour
but
i
am
confident
that
you
will
then
be
able
to
reconcile
our
having
luncheon
on
the
front
porch
our
coming
to
the
table
with
our
coats
and
collars
on
and
our
having
strawberries
to
eat
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
raise
them
ourselves
with
the
indisputable
truth
that
we
make
or
are
attempting
to
make
our
living
off
the
soil
we
profoundly
respect
the
desire
of
a
member
of
the
legal
profession
for
exactness
not
only
in
the
use
of
terms
but
in
the
conformity
of
facts
to
those
terms
i
trust
however
that
the
compromise
i
suggest
but
he
got
no
further
a
burst
of
appreciative
laughter
in
which
chase
himself
was
forced
to
join
bore
witness
to
the
effectiveness
with
which
the
cynical
critic
had
been
politely
answered
however
it
might
be
on
after
occasions
for
chase
became
content
to
enjoy
his
broiled
chicken
and
without
further
comment
on
the
inconsistency
of
their
appearance
upon
the
table
at
strawberry
acres
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
the
chases
had
reluctantly
taken
their
departure
bearing
with
them
gifts
of
strawberries
and
roses
in
the
sunshine
and
silence
reigned
undisturbed
except
by
the
light
june
breeze
which
rustled
the
leaves
enough
to
show
beneath
them
the
fruit
which
by
would
be
ripe
enough
to
pick
the
first
picking
had
been
a
small
one
and
had
gone
wholly
to
neighbours
and
friends
and
to
consumption
upon
the
home
table
in
two
days
more
the
gathering
of
the
harvest
would
begin
in
earnest
it
may
not
have
been
strictly
this
opening
of
the
season
by
feasting
and
bestowal
but
it
had
pleased
the
lady
of
the
garden
so
to
elect
and
there
had
been
no
dissenting
voice
not
even
that
of
her
brother
max
everybody
else
it
may
be
presumed
had
retired
to
rest
and
dress
for
the
evening
which
was
always
spent
when
the
weather
was
fair
upon
the
porch
when
sally
alone
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
hall
and
betook
herself
over
the
grass
through
the
garden
to
the
path
which
led
up
the
slope
to
the
woods
the
path
wound
past
the
orchard
past
the
strawberry
field
and
by
the
side
of
the
pasture
where
cowslip
and
whiteface
were
already
turning
their
faces
toward
the
bars
its
appearance
was
an
example
of
the
fashion
in
which
utility
and
sentiment
were
likely
to
find
themselves
mixed
upon
the
farm
called
strawberry
acres
along
its
borders
ran
a
riot
of
vines
wild
bushes
even
of
weeds
only
such
of
the
latter
having
been
cut
as
were
pests
of
the
sort
which
scatter
their
seeds
to
the
winds
trim
and
workmanlike
as
was
the
clearing
up
of
the
ground
just
beyond
the
lane
on
either
side
the
lane
itself
was
very
nearly
in
a
state
of
nature
it
was
therefore
a
picturesque
roadway
enough
and
sally
walking
along
it
bareheaded
clad
still
in
the
pink
gingham
of
the
morning
found
it
so
to
an
unusual
degree
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
would
have
been
an
object
ugly
indeed
which
would
have
seemed
devoid
of
all
beauty
to
sally
lane
on
this
the
sixteenth
of
june
she
kept
on
straight
up
the
winding
lane
to
the
border
of
the
woods
when
she
had
reached
the
first
trees
a
fine
group
of
oak
and
chestnut
lifting
stately
limbs
long
uncut
far
into
the
summer
air
she
turned
and
paused
to
look
back
from
this
point
she
could
see
far
and
the
whole
of
her
family
possessions
lay
before
her
outspread
in
all
the
beauty
of
june
at
its
bonniest
impulsively
she
stretched
out
her
arms
sally
lane
she
said
softly
to
herself
with
her
eyes
scanning
it
all
if
there
a
happier
girl
than
you
in
the
world
she
must
be
entirely
out
of
her
senses
with
joy
after
a
little
she
sat
down
her
back
against
a
her
face
toward
the
distant
view
presently
a
big
green
oak
leaf
fluttered
down
past
her
eyes
and
fell
into
her
lap
that
odd
she
thought
and
looked
up
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
great
limbs
rugged
with
years
of
the
oak
beneath
which
she
sat
she
looked
off
again
at
the
view
another
leaf
came
swirling
down
past
her
lighting
on
the
ground
probably
a
squirrel
she
explained
to
herself
concerning
this
phenomenon
of
falling
leaves
in
june
and
tried
again
to
descry
its
source
without
success
when
however
a
shower
of
the
green
missiles
came
down
together
she
got
to
her
feet
and
walked
around
the
tree
they
had
to
come
thick
as
leaves
in
vallombrosa
remarked
a
familiar
voice
from
far
above
her
before
you
would
pay
attention
i
fired
for
at
least
ten
minutes
before
you
would
so
much
as
look
up
will
you
come
up
or
shall
i
come
down
i
like
to
come
up
sally
replied
smiling
up
into
jarvis
brown
face
as
she
espied
him
sitting
astride
a
limb
well
up
in
the
branching
foliage
but
i
do
think
it
practical
why
be
practical
nobody
is
practical
on
strawberry
acres
according
to
a
certain
brilliant
but
skeptical
attorney
from
town
your
greatest
aim
has
been
to
remain
a
girl
as
long
as
possible
girls
climb
trees
he
began
to
descend
wait
cried
sally
as
he
set
foot
on
the
lowest
limb
a
matter
of
ten
feet
above
her
head
and
paused
to
look
down
at
her
stay
there
please
do
you
really
want
me
to
come
up
very
much
it
entirely
possible
set
your
foot
on
that
knob
reach
up
your
arm
i
let
myself
down
far
enough
to
get
hold
of
your
hand
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
be
sitting
beside
me
here
then
what
will
happen
then
we
have
a
little
talk
i
been
waiting
for
all
day
i
began
to
think
i
could
get
it
till
evening
fell
when
the
garden
might
help
me
out
i
think
the
garden
is
a
very
nice
place
for
conversation
sally
put
both
hands
behind
her
back
looking
up
at
him
better
than
the
limb
of
an
oak
tree
i
admit
it
for
some
sorts
of
conversation
up
here
i
should
be
forced
to
hold
on
with
one
arm
but
there
would
be
compensation
in
that
for
with
the
other
arm
i
should
be
forced
to
hold
you
on
his
laughing
eyes
looked
down
at
her
she
shook
her
head
if
i
came
up
the
tree
i
should
prove
that
i
am
still
a
girl
if
i
am
still
a
girl
are
you
still
a
girl
is
that
still
your
greatest
desire
he
leaned
forward
and
the
smile
suddenly
left
his
lips
his
eyes
searched
hers
the
face
she
bravely
lifted
to
him
was
a
girl
for
youthful
beauty
but
into
it
had
come
something
very
sweet
and
womanly
which
at
last
gave
him
the
leave
he
had
waited
so
long
for
no
i
think
i
grown
up
she
said
quite
clearly
with
an
exclamation
the
sinewy
figure
in
the
tree
made
short
work
of
the
ten
feet
to
the
ground
swinging
itself
off
from
the
limb
by
both
hands
and
dropping
lightly
down
i
do
think
i
could
have
waited
a
day
longer
said
jarvis
burnside
then
with
the
sheltering
trunk
of
the
great
oak
shutting
off
all
possible
vision
from
the
far
distant
house
he
drew
sally
lane
into
his
eager
arms
why
so
late
maxwell
lane
looked
up
to
ask
as
his
sister
sally
came
somewhat
hurriedly
in
to
dinner
when
the
rest
of
the
household
were
half
through
please
excuse
my
pink
gingham
apologized
sally
as
she
dropped
into
her
chair
she
glanced
from
burnside
in
cool
white
to
josephine
in
crisp
blue
nothing
could
be
more
becoming
josephine
asserted
always
ready
to
defend
her
friend
there
a
strawberry
stain
on
her
right
sleeve
bob
pointed
out
where
jarve
asked
alec
i
saw
him
as
i
came
in
he
was
on
his
way
replied
sally
lifting
a
glass
of
water
to
hide
a
pair
of
lips
which
wanted
to
laugh
jarvis
appeared
he
also
was
in
the
garb
be
had
worn
all
day
the
pair
seemed
oddly
similar
in
the
nonchalance
they
could
not
quite
successfully
carry
through
look
here
alec
scanned
