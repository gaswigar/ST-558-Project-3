chapter
i
the
gun
club
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
a
new
and
influential
club
was
established
in
the
city
of
baltimore
in
the
state
of
maryland
it
is
well
known
with
what
energy
the
taste
for
military
matters
became
developed
among
that
nation
of
shopkeepers
and
mechanics
simple
tradesmen
jumped
their
counters
to
become
extemporized
captains
colonels
and
generals
without
having
ever
passed
the
school
of
instruction
at
west
point
nevertheless
they
quickly
rivaled
their
compeers
of
the
old
continent
and
like
them
carried
off
victories
by
dint
of
lavish
expenditure
in
ammunition
money
and
men
but
the
point
in
which
the
americans
singularly
distanced
the
europeans
was
in
the
science
of
gunnery
not
indeed
that
their
weapons
retained
a
higher
degree
of
perfection
than
theirs
but
that
they
exhibited
dimensions
and
consequently
attained
hitherto
ranges
in
point
of
grazing
plunging
oblique
or
enfilading
or
firing
the
english
french
and
prussians
have
nothing
to
learn
but
their
cannon
howitzers
and
mortars
are
mere
compared
with
the
formidable
engines
of
the
american
artillery
this
fact
need
surprise
no
one
the
yankees
the
first
mechanicians
in
the
world
are
engineers
just
as
the
italians
are
musicians
and
the
germans
metaphysicians
by
right
of
birth
nothing
is
more
natural
therefore
than
to
perceive
them
applying
their
audacious
ingenuity
to
the
science
of
gunnery
witness
the
marvels
of
parrott
dahlgren
and
rodman
the
armstrong
palliser
and
beaulieu
guns
were
compelled
to
bow
before
their
transatlantic
rivals
now
when
an
american
has
an
idea
he
directly
seeks
a
second
american
to
share
it
if
there
be
three
they
elect
a
president
and
two
secretaries
given
four
they
name
a
keeper
of
records
and
the
office
is
ready
for
work
five
they
convene
a
general
meeting
and
the
club
is
fully
constituted
so
things
were
managed
in
baltimore
the
inventor
of
a
new
cannon
associated
himself
with
the
caster
and
the
borer
thus
was
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
gun
club
in
a
single
month
after
its
formation
it
numbered
effective
members
and
corresponding
members
one
condition
was
imposed
as
a
qua
upon
every
candidate
for
admission
into
the
association
and
that
was
the
condition
of
having
designed
or
more
or
less
perfected
a
cannon
or
in
default
of
a
cannon
at
least
a
firearm
of
some
description
it
may
however
be
mentioned
that
mere
inventors
of
revolvers
carbines
and
similar
small
arms
met
with
little
consideration
artillerists
always
commanded
the
chief
place
of
favor
the
estimation
in
which
these
gentlemen
were
held
according
to
one
of
the
most
scientific
exponents
of
the
gun
club
was
proportional
to
the
masses
of
their
guns
and
in
the
direct
ratio
of
the
square
of
the
distances
attained
by
their
projectiles
the
gun
club
once
founded
it
is
easy
to
conceive
the
result
of
the
inventive
genius
of
the
americans
their
military
weapons
attained
colossal
proportions
and
their
projectiles
exceeding
the
prescribed
limits
unfortunately
occasionally
cut
in
two
some
unoffending
pedestrians
these
inventions
in
fact
left
far
in
the
rear
the
timid
instruments
of
european
artillery
it
is
but
fair
to
add
that
these
yankees
brave
as
they
have
ever
proved
themselves
to
be
did
not
confine
themselves
to
theories
and
formulae
but
that
they
paid
heavily
propria
for
their
inventions
among
them
were
to
be
counted
officers
of
all
ranks
from
lieutenants
to
generals
military
men
of
every
age
from
those
who
were
just
making
their
in
the
profession
of
arms
up
to
those
who
had
grown
old
in
the
many
had
found
their
rest
on
the
field
of
battle
whose
names
figured
in
the
book
of
honor
of
the
gun
club
and
of
those
who
made
good
their
return
the
greater
proportion
bore
the
marks
of
their
indisputable
valor
crutches
wooden
legs
artificial
arms
steel
hooks
caoutchouc
jaws
silver
craniums
platinum
noses
were
all
to
be
found
in
the
collection
and
it
was
calculated
by
the
great
statistician
pitcairn
that
throughout
the
gun
club
there
was
not
quite
one
arm
between
four
persons
and
two
legs
between
six
nevertheless
these
valiant
artillerists
took
no
particular
account
of
these
little
facts
and
felt
justly
proud
when
the
despatches
of
a
battle
returned
the
number
of
victims
at
the
quantity
of
projectiles
expended
one
day
however
sad
and
melancholy
day
peace
was
signed
between
the
survivors
of
the
war
the
thunder
of
the
guns
gradually
ceased
the
mortars
were
silent
the
howitzers
were
muzzled
for
an
indefinite
period
the
cannon
with
muzzles
depressed
were
returned
into
the
arsenal
the
shot
were
repiled
all
bloody
reminiscences
were
effaced
the
grew
luxuriantly
in
the
fields
all
mourning
garments
were
laid
aside
together
with
grief
and
the
gun
club
was
relegated
to
profound
inactivity
some
few
of
the
more
advanced
and
inveterate
theorists
set
themselves
again
to
work
upon
calculations
regarding
the
laws
of
projectiles
they
reverted
invariably
to
gigantic
shells
and
howitzers
of
unparalleled
caliber
still
in
default
of
practical
experience
what
was
the
value
of
mere
theories
consequently
the
clubrooms
became
deserted
the
servants
dozed
in
the
antechambers
the
newspapers
grew
mouldy
on
the
tables
sounds
of
snoring
came
from
dark
corners
and
the
members
of
the
gun
club
erstwhile
so
noisy
in
their
seances
were
reduced
to
silence
by
this
disastrous
peace
and
gave
themselves
up
wholly
to
dreams
of
a
platonic
kind
of
artillery
this
is
horrible
said
tom
hunter
one
evening
while
rapidly
carbonizing
his
wooden
legs
in
the
fireplace
of
the
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
look
forward
to
what
a
loathsome
existence
when
again
shall
the
guns
arouse
us
in
the
morning
with
their
delightful
reports
those
days
are
gone
by
said
jolly
bilsby
trying
to
extend
his
missing
arms
it
was
delightful
once
upon
a
time
one
invented
a
gun
and
hardly
was
it
cast
when
one
hastened
to
try
it
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
then
one
returned
to
camp
with
a
word
of
encouragement
from
sherman
or
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
from
mcclellan
but
now
the
generals
are
gone
back
to
their
counters
and
in
place
of
projectiles
they
despatch
bales
of
cotton
by
jove
the
future
of
gunnery
in
america
is
lost
ay
and
no
war
in
prospect
continued
the
famous
james
maston
scratching
with
his
steel
hook
his
cranium
not
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
and
that
too
at
such
a
critical
period
in
the
progress
of
the
science
of
artillery
yes
gentlemen
i
who
address
you
have
myself
this
very
morning
perfected
a
model
plan
section
elevation
etc
of
a
mortar
destined
to
change
all
the
conditions
of
warfare
no
is
it
possible
replied
tom
hunter
his
thoughts
reverting
involuntarily
to
a
former
invention
of
the
hon
maston
by
which
at
its
first
trial
he
had
succeeded
in
killing
three
hundred
and
people
fact
replied
he
still
what
is
the
use
of
so
many
studies
worked
out
so
many
difficulties
vanquished
it
mere
waste
of
time
the
new
world
seems
to
have
made
up
its
mind
to
live
in
peace
and
our
bellicose
predicts
some
approaching
catastrophes
arising
out
of
this
scandalous
increase
of
population
nevertheless
replied
colonel
blomsberry
they
are
always
struggling
in
europe
to
maintain
the
principle
of
nationalities
well
well
there
might
be
some
field
for
enterprise
down
there
and
if
they
would
accept
our
services
what
are
you
dreaming
of
screamed
bilsby
work
at
gunnery
for
the
benefit
of
foreigners
that
would
be
better
than
doing
nothing
here
returned
the
colonel
quite
so
said
matson
but
still
we
need
not
dream
of
that
expedient
and
why
not
demanded
the
colonel
because
their
ideas
of
progress
in
the
old
world
are
contrary
to
our
american
habits
of
thought
those
fellows
believe
that
one
ca
become
a
general
without
having
served
first
as
an
ensign
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
one
ca
point
a
gun
without
having
first
cast
it
oneself
ridiculous
replied
tom
hunter
whittling
with
his
the
arms
of
his
easy
chair
but
if
that
be
the
case
there
all
that
is
left
for
us
is
to
plant
tobacco
and
distill
what
roared
maston
shall
we
not
employ
these
remaining
years
of
our
life
in
perfecting
firearms
shall
there
never
be
a
fresh
opportunity
of
trying
the
ranges
of
projectiles
shall
the
air
never
again
be
lighted
with
the
glare
of
our
guns
no
international
difficulty
ever
arise
to
enable
us
to
declare
war
against
some
transatlantic
power
shall
not
the
french
sink
one
of
our
steamers
or
the
english
in
defiance
of
the
rights
of
nations
hang
a
few
of
our
countrymen
no
such
luck
replied
colonel
blomsberry
nothing
of
the
kind
is
likely
to
happen
and
even
if
it
did
we
should
not
profit
by
it
american
susceptibility
is
fast
declining
and
we
are
all
going
to
the
dogs
it
is
too
true
replied
maston
with
fresh
violence
there
are
a
thousand
grounds
for
fighting
and
yet
we
do
fight
we
save
up
our
arms
and
legs
for
the
benefit
of
nations
who
know
what
to
do
with
them
but
stop
without
going
out
of
way
to
find
a
cause
for
war
did
not
north
america
once
belong
to
the
english
undoubtedly
replied
tom
hunter
stamping
his
crutch
with
fury
well
then
replied
maston
why
should
not
england
in
her
turn
belong
to
the
americans
it
would
be
but
just
and
fair
returned
colonel
blomsberry
go
and
propose
it
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
cried
maston
and
see
how
he
will
receive
you
bah
growled
bilsby
between
the
four
teeth
which
the
war
had
left
him
that
will
never
do
by
jove
cried
maston
he
must
count
on
my
vote
at
the
next
election
nor
on
ours
replied
unanimously
all
the
bellicose
invalids
meanwhile
replied
maston
allow
me
to
say
that
if
i
can
not
get
an
opportunity
to
try
my
new
mortars
on
a
real
field
of
battle
i
shall
say
to
the
members
of
the
gun
club
and
go
and
bury
myself
in
the
prairies
of
arkansas
in
that
case
we
will
accompany
you
cried
the
others
matters
were
in
this
unfortunate
condition
and
the
club
was
threatened
with
approaching
dissolution
when
an
unexpected
circumstance
occurred
to
prevent
so
deplorable
a
catastrophe
on
the
morrow
after
this
conversation
every
member
of
the
association
received
a
sealed
circular
couched
in
the
following
terms
baltimore
october
the
president
of
the
gun
club
has
the
honor
to
inform
his
colleagues
that
at
the
meeting
of
the
instant
he
will
bring
before
them
a
communication
of
an
extremely
interesting
nature
he
requests
therefore
that
they
will
make
it
convenient
to
attend
in
accordance
with
the
present
invitation
very
cordially
impey
barbicane
chapter
ii
president
barbicane
communication
on
the
of
october
at
eight
a
dense
crowd
pressed
toward
the
saloons
of
the
gun
club
at
no
union
square
all
the
members
of
the
association
resident
in
baltimore
attended
the
invitation
of
their
president
as
regards
the
corresponding
members
notices
were
delivered
by
hundreds
throughout
the
streets
of
the
city
and
large
as
was
the
great
hall
it
was
quite
inadequate
to
accommodate
the
crowd
of
they
overflowed
into
the
adjoining
rooms
down
the
narrow
passages
into
the
outer
courtyards
there
they
ran
against
the
vulgar
herd
who
pressed
up
to
the
doors
each
struggling
to
reach
the
front
ranks
all
eager
to
learn
the
nature
of
the
important
communication
of
president
barbicane
all
pushing
squeezing
crushing
with
that
perfect
freedom
of
action
which
is
so
peculiar
to
the
masses
when
educated
in
ideas
of
on
that
evening
a
stranger
who
might
have
chanced
to
be
in
baltimore
could
not
have
gained
admission
for
love
or
money
into
the
great
hall
that
was
reserved
exclusively
for
resident
or
corresponding
members
no
one
else
could
possibly
have
obtained
a
place
and
the
city
magnates
municipal
councilors
and
select
men
were
compelled
to
mingle
with
the
mere
townspeople
in
order
to
catch
stray
bits
of
news
from
the
interior
nevertheless
the
vast
hall
presented
a
curious
spectacle
its
immense
area
was
singularly
adapted
to
the
purpose
lofty
pillars
formed
of
cannon
superposed
upon
huge
mortars
as
a
base
supported
the
fine
ironwork
of
the
arches
a
perfect
piece
of
lacework
trophies
of
blunderbuses
matchlocks
arquebuses
carbines
all
kinds
of
firearms
ancient
and
modern
were
picturesquely
interlaced
against
the
walls
the
gas
lit
up
in
full
glare
myriads
of
revolvers
grouped
in
the
form
of
lustres
while
groups
of
pistols
and
candelabra
formed
of
muskets
bound
together
completed
this
magnificent
display
of
brilliance
models
of
cannon
bronze
castings
sights
covered
with
dents
plates
battered
by
the
shots
of
the
gun
club
assortments
of
rammers
and
sponges
chaplets
of
shells
wreaths
of
projectiles
garlands
of
howitzers
in
short
all
the
apparatus
of
the
artillerist
enchanted
the
eye
by
this
wonderful
arrangement
and
induced
a
kind
of
belief
that
their
real
purpose
was
ornamental
rather
than
deadly
at
the
further
end
of
the
saloon
the
president
assisted
by
four
secretaries
occupied
a
large
platform
his
chair
supported
by
a
carved
was
modeled
upon
the
ponderous
proportions
of
a
mortar
it
was
pointed
at
an
angle
of
ninety
degrees
and
suspended
upon
truncheons
so
that
the
president
could
balance
himself
upon
it
as
upon
a
a
very
agreeable
fact
in
the
very
hot
weather
upon
the
table
a
huge
iron
plate
supported
upon
six
carronades
stood
an
inkstand
of
exquisite
elegance
made
of
a
beautifully
chased
spanish
piece
and
a
sonnette
which
when
required
could
give
forth
a
report
equal
to
that
of
a
revolver
during
violent
debates
this
novel
kind
of
bell
scarcely
sufficed
to
drown
the
clamor
of
these
excitable
artillerists
in
front
of
the
table
benches
arranged
in
zigzag
form
like
the
circumvallations
of
a
retrenchment
formed
a
succession
of
bastions
and
curtains
set
apart
for
the
use
of
the
members
of
the
club
and
on
this
especial
evening
one
might
say
all
the
world
was
on
the
ramparts
the
president
was
sufficiently
well
known
however
for
all
to
be
assured
that
he
would
not
put
his
colleagues
to
discomfort
without
some
very
strong
motive
impey
barbicane
was
a
man
of
forty
years
of
age
calm
cold
austere
of
a
singularly
serious
and
demeanor
punctual
as
a
chronometer
of
imperturbable
temper
and
immovable
character
by
no
means
chivalrous
yet
adventurous
withal
and
always
bringing
practical
ideas
to
bear
upon
the
very
rashest
enterprises
an
essentially
new
englander
a
northern
colonist
a
descendant
of
the
old
roundheads
and
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
south
those
ancient
cavaliers
of
the
mother
country
in
a
word
he
was
a
yankee
to
the
backbone
barbicane
had
made
a
large
fortune
as
a
timber
merchant
being
nominated
director
of
artillery
during
the
war
he
proved
himself
fertile
in
invention
bold
in
his
conceptions
he
contributed
powerfully
to
the
progress
of
that
arm
and
gave
an
immense
impetus
to
experimental
researches
he
was
personage
of
the
middle
height
having
by
a
rare
exception
in
the
gun
club
all
his
limbs
complete
his
strongly
marked
features
seemed
drawn
by
square
and
rule
and
if
it
be
true
that
in
order
to
judge
a
man
character
one
must
look
at
his
profile
barbicane
so
examined
exhibited
the
most
certain
indications
of
energy
audacity
and
at
this
moment
he
was
sitting
in
his
armchair
silent
absorbed
lost
in
reflection
sheltered
under
his
hat
a
kind
of
black
cylinder
which
always
seems
firmly
screwed
upon
the
head
of
an
american
just
when
the
clock
in
the
great
hall
struck
eight
barbicane
as
if
he
had
been
set
in
motion
by
a
spring
raised
himself
up
a
profound
silence
ensued
and
the
speaker
in
a
somewhat
emphatic
tone
of
voice
commenced
as
follows
my
brave
colleagues
too
long
already
a
paralyzing
peace
has
plunged
the
members
of
the
gun
club
in
deplorable
inactivity
after
a
period
of
years
full
of
incidents
we
have
been
compelled
to
abandon
our
labors
and
to
stop
short
on
the
road
of
progress
i
do
not
hesitate
to
state
baldly
that
any
war
which
would
recall
us
to
arms
would
be
welcome
tremendous
applause
but
war
gentlemen
is
impossible
under
existing
circumstances
and
however
we
may
desire
it
many
years
may
elapse
before
our
cannon
shall
again
thunder
in
the
field
of
battle
we
must
make
up
our
minds
then
to
seek
in
another
train
of
ideas
some
field
for
the
activity
which
we
all
pine
for
the
meeting
felt
that
the
president
was
now
approaching
the
critical
point
and
redoubled
their
attention
accordingly
for
some
months
past
my
brave
colleagues
continued
barbicane
i
have
been
asking
myself
whether
while
confining
ourselves
to
our
own
particular
objects
we
could
not
enter
upon
some
grand
experiment
worthy
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
whether
the
progress
of
artillery
science
would
not
enable
us
to
carry
it
out
to
a
successful
issue
i
have
been
considering
working
calculating
and
the
result
of
my
studies
is
the
conviction
that
we
are
safe
to
succeed
in
an
enterprise
which
to
any
other
country
would
appear
wholly
impracticable
this
project
the
result
of
long
elaboration
is
the
object
of
my
present
communication
it
is
worthy
of
yourselves
worthy
of
the
antecedents
of
the
gun
club
and
it
can
not
fail
to
make
some
noise
in
the
world
a
thrill
of
excitement
ran
through
the
meeting
barbicane
having
by
a
rapid
movement
firmly
fixed
his
hat
upon
his
head
calmly
continued
his
harangue
there
is
no
one
among
you
my
brave
colleagues
who
has
not
seen
the
moon
or
at
least
heard
speak
of
it
do
be
surprised
if
i
am
about
to
discourse
to
you
regarding
the
queen
of
the
night
it
is
perhaps
reserved
for
us
to
become
the
columbuses
of
this
unknown
world
only
enter
into
my
plans
and
second
me
with
all
your
power
and
i
will
lead
you
to
its
conquest
and
its
name
shall
be
added
to
those
of
the
states
which
compose
this
great
union
three
cheers
for
the
moon
roared
the
gun
club
with
one
voice
the
moon
gentlemen
has
been
carefully
studied
continued
barbicane
her
mass
density
and
weight
her
constitution
motions
distance
as
well
as
her
place
in
the
solar
system
have
all
been
exactly
determined
selenographic
charts
have
been
constructed
with
a
perfection
which
equals
if
it
does
not
even
surpass
that
of
our
terrestrial
maps
photography
has
given
us
proofs
of
the
incomparable
beauty
of
our
satellite
all
is
known
regarding
the
moon
which
mathematical
science
astronomy
geology
and
optics
can
learn
about
her
but
up
to
the
present
moment
no
direct
communication
has
been
established
with
her
a
violent
movement
of
interest
and
surprise
here
greeted
this
remark
of
the
speaker
permit
me
he
continued
to
recount
to
you
briefly
how
certain
ardent
spirits
starting
on
imaginary
journeys
have
penetrated
the
secrets
of
our
satellite
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
certain
david
fabricius
boasted
of
having
seen
with
his
own
eyes
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
in
a
frenchman
one
jean
baudoin
published
a
performed
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
by
domingo
gonzalez
a
spanish
adventurer
at
the
same
period
cyrano
de
bergerac
published
that
celebrated
in
the
moon
which
met
with
such
success
in
france
somewhat
later
another
frenchman
named
fontenelle
wrote
plurality
of
worlds
a
of
its
time
about
a
small
treatise
translated
from
the
new
york
related
how
sir
john
herschel
having
been
despatched
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
for
the
purpose
of
making
there
some
astronomical
calculations
had
by
means
of
a
telescope
brought
to
perfection
by
means
of
internal
lighting
reduced
the
apparent
distance
of
the
moon
to
eighty
yards
he
then
distinctly
perceived
caverns
frequented
by
hippopotami
green
mountains
bordered
by
golden
sheep
with
horns
of
ivory
a
white
species
of
deer
and
inhabitants
with
membranous
wings
like
bats
this
the
work
of
an
american
named
locke
had
a
great
sale
but
to
bring
this
rapid
sketch
to
a
close
i
will
only
add
that
a
certain
hans
pfaal
of
rotterdam
launching
himself
in
a
balloon
filled
with
a
gas
extracted
from
nitrogen
times
lighter
than
hydrogen
reached
the
moon
after
a
passage
of
nineteen
hours
this
journey
like
all
previous
ones
was
purely
imaginary
still
it
was
the
work
of
a
popular
american
author
i
mean
edgar
poe
cheers
for
edgar
poe
roared
the
assemblage
electrified
by
their
president
words
i
have
now
enumerated
said
barbicane
the
experiments
which
i
call
purely
paper
ones
and
wholly
insufficient
to
establish
serious
relations
with
the
queen
of
the
night
nevertheless
i
am
bound
to
add
that
some
practical
geniuses
have
attempted
to
establish
actual
communication
with
her
thus
a
few
days
ago
a
german
geometrician
proposed
to
send
a
scientific
expedition
to
the
steppes
of
siberia
there
on
those
vast
plains
they
were
to
describe
enormous
geometric
figures
drawn
in
characters
of
reflecting
luminosity
among
which
was
the
proposition
regarding
the
of
the
hypothenuse
commonly
called
the
bridge
by
the
french
intelligent
being
said
the
geometrician
understand
the
scientific
meaning
of
that
figure
the
selenites
do
they
exist
will
respond
by
a
similar
figure
and
a
communication
being
thus
once
established
it
will
be
easy
to
form
an
alphabet
which
shall
enable
us
to
converse
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
so
spoke
the
german
geometrician
but
his
project
was
never
put
into
practice
and
up
to
the
present
day
there
is
no
bond
in
existence
between
the
earth
and
her
satellite
it
is
reserved
for
the
practical
genius
of
americans
to
establish
a
communication
with
the
sidereal
world
the
means
of
arriving
thither
are
simple
easy
certain
infallible
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
my
present
proposal
a
storm
of
acclamations
greeted
these
words
there
was
not
a
single
person
in
the
whole
audience
who
was
not
overcome
carried
away
lifted
out
of
himself
by
the
speaker
words
applause
resounded
from
all
sides
as
soon
as
the
excitement
had
partially
subsided
barbicane
resumed
his
speech
in
a
somewhat
graver
voice
you
know
said
he
what
progress
artillery
science
has
made
during
the
last
few
years
and
what
a
degree
of
perfection
firearms
of
every
kind
have
reached
moreover
you
are
well
aware
that
in
general
terms
the
resisting
power
of
cannon
and
the
expansive
force
of
gunpowder
are
practically
unlimited
well
starting
from
this
principle
i
ask
myself
whether
supposing
sufficient
apparatus
could
be
obtained
constructed
upon
the
conditions
of
ascertained
resistance
it
might
not
be
possible
to
project
a
shot
up
to
the
moon
at
these
words
a
murmur
of
amazement
escaped
from
a
thousand
panting
chests
then
succeeded
a
moment
of
perfect
silence
resembling
that
profound
stillness
which
precedes
the
bursting
of
a
thunderstorm
in
point
of
fact
a
thunderstorm
did
peal
forth
but
it
was
the
thunder
of
applause
or
cries
and
of
uproar
which
made
the
very
hall
tremble
the
president
attempted
to
speak
but
could
not
it
was
fully
ten
minutes
before
he
could
make
himself
heard
suffer
me
to
finish
he
calmly
continued
i
have
looked
at
the
question
in
all
its
bearings
i
have
resolutely
attacked
it
and
by
incontrovertible
calculations
i
find
that
a
projectile
endowed
with
an
initial
velocity
of
yards
per
second
and
aimed
at
the
moon
must
necessarily
reach
it
i
have
the
honor
my
brave
colleagues
to
propose
a
trial
of
this
little
experiment
chapter
iii
effect
of
the
president
communication
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
effect
produced
by
the
last
words
of
the
honorable
president
the
cries
the
shouts
the
succession
of
roars
hurrahs
and
all
the
varied
vociferations
which
the
american
language
is
capable
of
supplying
it
was
a
scene
of
indescribable
confusion
and
uproar
they
shouted
they
clapped
they
stamped
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
all
the
weapons
in
the
museum
discharged
at
once
could
not
have
more
violently
set
in
motion
the
waves
of
sound
one
need
not
be
surprised
at
this
there
are
some
cannoneers
nearly
as
noisy
as
their
own
guns
barbicane
remained
calm
in
the
midst
of
this
enthusiastic
clamor
perhaps
he
was
desirous
of
addressing
a
few
more
words
to
his
colleagues
for
by
his
gestures
he
demanded
silence
and
his
powerful
alarum
was
worn
out
by
its
violent
reports
no
attention
however
was
paid
to
his
request
he
was
presently
torn
from
his
seat
and
passed
from
the
hands
of
his
faithful
colleagues
into
the
arms
of
a
no
less
excited
crowd
nothing
can
astound
an
american
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
the
word
impossible
in
not
a
french
one
people
have
evidently
been
deceived
by
the
dictionary
in
america
all
is
easy
all
is
simple
and
as
for
mechanical
difficulties
they
are
overcome
before
they
arise
between
barbicane
proposition
and
its
realization
no
true
yankee
would
have
allowed
even
the
semblance
of
a
difficulty
to
be
possible
a
thing
with
them
is
no
sooner
said
than
done
the
triumphal
progress
of
the
president
continued
throughout
the
evening
it
was
a
regular
torchlight
procession
irish
germans
french
scotch
all
the
heterogeneous
units
which
make
up
the
population
of
maryland
shouted
in
their
respective
vernaculars
and
the
vivas
hurrahs
and
bravos
were
intermingled
in
inexpressible
enthusiasm
just
at
this
crisis
as
though
she
comprehended
all
this
agitation
regarding
herself
the
moon
shone
forth
with
serene
splendor
eclipsing
by
her
intense
illumination
all
the
surrounding
lights
the
yankees
all
turned
their
gaze
toward
her
resplendent
orb
kissed
their
hands
called
her
by
all
kinds
of
endearing
names
between
eight
and
midnight
one
optician
in
street
made
his
fortune
by
the
sale
of
midnight
arrived
and
the
enthusiasm
showed
no
signs
of
diminution
it
spread
equally
among
all
classes
of
citizens
men
of
science
shopkeepers
merchants
porters
as
well
as
greenhorns
were
stirred
in
their
innermost
fibres
a
national
enterprise
was
at
stake
the
whole
city
high
and
low
the
quays
bordering
the
patapsco
the
ships
lying
in
the
basins
disgorged
a
crowd
drunk
with
joy
gin
and
whisky
every
one
chattered
argued
discussed
disputed
applauded
from
the
gentleman
lounging
upon
the
barroom
settee
with
his
tumbler
of
before
him
down
to
the
waterman
who
got
drunk
upon
his
in
the
dingy
taverns
of
fell
point
about
two
however
the
excitement
began
to
subside
president
barbicane
reached
his
house
bruised
crushed
and
squeezed
almost
to
a
mummy
hercules
could
not
have
resisted
a
similar
outbreak
of
enthusiasm
the
crowd
gradually
deserted
the
squares
and
streets
the
four
railways
from
philadelphia
and
washington
harrisburg
and
wheeling
which
converge
at
baltimore
whirled
away
the
heterogeneous
population
to
the
four
corners
of
the
united
states
and
the
city
subsided
into
comparative
tranquility
on
the
following
day
thanks
to
the
telegraphic
wires
five
hundred
newspapers
and
journals
daily
weekly
monthly
or
all
took
up
the
question
they
examined
it
under
all
its
different
aspects
physical
meteorological
economical
or
moral
up
to
its
bearings
on
politics
or
civilization
they
debated
whether
the
moon
was
a
finished
world
or
whether
it
was
destined
to
undergo
any
further
transformation
did
it
resemble
the
earth
at
the
period
when
the
latter
was
destitute
as
yet
of
an
atmosphere
what
kind
of
spectacle
would
its
hidden
hemisphere
present
to
our
terrestrial
spheroid
granting
that
the
question
at
present
was
simply
that
of
sending
a
projectile
up
to
the
moon
every
one
must
see
that
that
involved
the
commencement
of
a
series
of
experiments
all
must
hope
that
some
day
america
would
penetrate
the
deepest
secrets
of
that
mysterious
orb
and
some
even
seemed
to
fear
lest
its
conquest
should
not
sensibly
derange
the
equilibrium
of
europe
the
project
once
under
discussion
not
a
single
paragraph
suggested
a
doubt
of
its
realization
all
the
papers
pamphlets
reports
all
the
journals
published
by
the
scientific
literary
and
religious
societies
enlarged
upon
its
advantages
and
the
society
of
natural
history
of
boston
the
society
of
science
and
art
of
albany
the
geographical
and
statistical
society
of
new
york
the
philosophical
society
of
philadelphia
and
the
smithsonian
of
washington
sent
innumerable
letters
of
congratulation
to
the
gun
club
together
with
offers
of
immediate
assistance
and
money
from
that
day
forward
impey
barbicane
became
one
of
the
greatest
citizens
of
the
united
states
a
kind
of
washington
of
science
a
single
trait
of
feeling
taken
from
many
others
will
serve
to
show
the
point
which
this
homage
of
a
whole
people
to
a
single
individual
attained
some
few
days
after
this
memorable
meeting
of
the
gun
club
the
manager
of
an
english
company
announced
at
the
baltimore
theatre
the
production
of
much
ado
about
nothing
but
the
populace
seeing
in
that
title
an
allusion
damaging
to
barbicane
project
broke
into
the
auditorium
smashed
the
benches
and
compelled
the
unlucky
director
to
alter
his
playbill
being
a
sensible
man
he
bowed
to
the
public
will
and
replaced
the
offending
comedy
by
as
you
like
it
and
for
many
weeks
he
realized
fabulous
profits
chapter
iv
reply
from
the
observatory
of
cambridge
barbicane
however
lost
not
one
moment
amid
all
the
enthusiasm
of
which
he
had
become
the
object
his
first
care
was
to
reassemble
his
colleagues
in
the
of
the
gun
club
there
after
some
discussion
it
was
agreed
to
consult
the
astronomers
regarding
the
astronomical
part
of
the
enterprise
their
reply
once
ascertained
they
could
then
discuss
the
mechanical
means
and
nothing
should
be
wanting
to
ensure
the
success
of
this
great
experiment
a
note
couched
in
precise
terms
containing
special
interrogatories
was
then
drawn
up
and
addressed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
in
massachusetts
this
city
where
the
first
university
of
the
united
states
was
founded
is
justly
celebrated
for
its
astronomical
staff
there
are
to
be
found
assembled
all
the
most
eminent
men
of
science
here
is
to
be
seen
at
work
that
powerful
telescope
which
enabled
bond
to
resolve
the
nebula
of
andromeda
and
clarke
to
discover
the
satellite
of
sirius
this
celebrated
institution
fully
justified
on
all
points
the
confidence
reposed
in
it
by
the
gun
club
so
after
two
days
the
reply
so
impatiently
awaited
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
president
barbicane
it
was
couched
in
the
following
terms
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
to
the
president
of
the
gun
club
at
cambridge
october
on
the
receipt
of
your
favor
of
the
instant
addressed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
in
the
name
of
the
members
of
the
baltimore
gun
club
our
staff
was
immediately
called
together
and
it
was
judged
expedient
to
reply
as
follows
the
questions
which
have
been
proposed
to
it
are
these
is
it
possible
to
transmit
a
projectile
up
to
the
moon
what
is
the
exact
distance
which
separates
the
earth
from
its
satellite
what
will
be
the
period
of
transit
of
the
projectile
when
endowed
with
sufficient
initial
velocity
and
consequently
at
what
moment
ought
it
to
be
discharged
in
order
that
it
may
touch
the
moon
at
a
particular
point
at
what
precise
moment
will
the
moon
present
herself
in
the
most
favorable
position
to
be
reached
by
the
projectile
what
point
in
the
heavens
ought
the
cannon
to
be
aimed
at
which
is
intended
to
discharge
the
projectile
what
place
will
the
moon
occupy
in
the
heavens
at
the
moment
of
the
projectile
departure
regarding
the
question
is
it
possible
to
transmit
a
projectile
up
to
the
moon
yes
provided
it
possess
an
initial
velocity
of
yards
per
second
calculations
prove
that
to
be
sufficient
in
proportion
as
we
recede
from
the
earth
the
action
of
gravitation
diminishes
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
square
of
the
distance
that
is
to
say
three
times
a
given
distance
the
action
is
nine
times
consequently
the
weight
of
a
shot
will
decrease
and
will
become
reduced
to
at
the
instant
that
the
attraction
of
the
moon
exactly
counterpoises
that
of
the
earth
that
is
to
say
at
of
its
passage
at
that
instant
the
projectile
will
have
no
weight
whatever
and
if
it
passes
that
point
it
will
fall
into
the
moon
by
the
sole
effect
of
the
lunar
attraction
the
of
the
experiment
is
therefore
absolutely
demonstrated
its
must
depend
upon
the
power
of
the
engine
employed
as
to
the
question
what
is
the
exact
distance
which
separates
the
earth
from
its
satellite
the
moon
does
not
describe
a
round
the
earth
but
rather
an
of
which
our
earth
occupies
one
of
the
the
consequence
therefore
is
that
at
certain
times
it
approaches
nearer
to
and
at
others
it
recedes
farther
from
the
earth
in
astronomical
language
it
is
at
one
time
in
at
another
in
now
the
difference
between
its
greatest
and
its
least
distance
is
too
considerable
to
be
left
out
of
consideration
in
point
of
fact
in
its
apogee
the
moon
is
miles
and
in
its
perigee
miles
only
distant
a
fact
which
makes
a
difference
of
miles
or
more
than
of
the
entire
distance
the
perigee
distance
therefore
is
that
which
ought
to
serve
as
the
basis
of
all
calculations
to
the
question
if
the
shot
should
preserve
continuously
its
initial
velocity
of
yards
per
second
it
would
require
little
more
than
nine
hours
to
reach
its
destination
but
inasmuch
as
that
initial
velocity
will
be
continually
decreasing
it
will
occupy
seconds
that
is
in
reaching
the
point
where
the
attraction
of
the
earth
and
moon
will
be
from
this
point
it
will
fall
into
the
moon
in
seconds
or
it
will
be
desirable
therefore
to
discharge
it
before
the
arrival
of
the
moon
at
the
point
aimed
at
regarding
question
at
what
precise
moment
will
the
moon
present
herself
in
the
most
favorable
position
after
what
has
been
said
above
it
will
be
necessary
first
of
all
to
choose
the
period
when
the
moon
will
be
in
perigee
and
the
moment
when
she
will
be
crossing
the
zenith
which
latter
event
will
further
diminish
the
entire
distance
by
a
length
equal
to
the
radius
of
the
earth
miles
the
result
of
which
will
be
that
the
final
passage
remaining
to
be
accomplished
will
be
miles
but
although
the
moon
passes
her
perigee
every
month
she
does
not
reach
the
zenith
always
exactly
the
same
she
does
not
appear
under
these
two
conditions
simultaneously
except
at
long
intervals
of
time
it
will
be
necessary
therefore
to
wait
for
the
moment
when
her
passage
in
perigee
shall
coincide
with
that
in
the
zenith
now
by
a
fortunate
circumstance
on
the
of
december
in
the
ensuing
year
the
moon
present
these
two
conditions
at
midnight
she
will
be
in
perigee
that
is
at
her
shortest
distance
from
the
earth
and
at
the
same
moment
she
will
be
crossing
the
zenith
on
the
question
at
what
point
in
the
heavens
ought
the
cannon
to
be
aimed
the
preceding
remarks
being
admitted
the
cannon
ought
to
be
pointed
to
the
zenith
of
the
place
its
fire
therefore
will
be
perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
and
the
projectile
will
soonest
pass
beyond
the
range
of
the
terrestrial
attraction
but
in
order
that
the
moon
should
reach
the
zenith
of
a
given
place
it
is
necessary
that
the
place
should
not
exceed
in
latitude
the
declination
of
the
luminary
in
other
words
it
must
be
comprised
within
the
degrees
and
of
lat
or
in
every
other
spot
the
fire
must
necessarily
be
oblique
which
would
seriously
militate
against
the
success
of
the
experiment
as
to
the
question
what
place
will
the
moon
occupy
in
the
heavens
at
the
moment
of
the
projectile
departure
at
the
moment
when
the
projectile
shall
be
discharged
into
space
the
moon
which
travels
daily
forward
will
be
distant
from
the
zenith
point
by
four
times
that
quantity
by
a
space
which
corresponds
to
the
path
which
she
will
describe
during
the
entire
journey
of
the
projectile
but
inasmuch
as
it
is
equally
necessary
to
take
into
account
the
deviation
which
the
rotary
motion
of
the
earth
will
impart
to
the
shot
and
as
the
shot
can
not
reach
the
moon
until
after
a
deviation
equal
to
radii
of
the
earth
which
calculated
upon
the
orbit
are
equal
to
about
eleven
degrees
it
becomes
necessary
to
add
these
eleven
degrees
to
those
which
express
the
retardation
of
the
moon
just
mentioned
that
is
to
say
in
round
numbers
about
degrees
consequently
at
the
moment
of
firing
the
visual
radius
applied
to
the
moon
will
describe
with
the
vertical
line
of
the
place
an
angle
of
degrees
these
are
our
answers
to
the
questions
proposed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
by
the
members
of
the
gun
club
to
sum
up
the
cannon
ought
to
be
planted
in
a
country
situated
between
and
of
or
lat
it
ought
to
be
pointed
directly
toward
the
zenith
of
the
place
the
projectile
ought
to
be
propelled
with
an
initial
velocity
of
yards
per
second
it
ought
to
be
discharged
at
of
the
of
december
of
the
ensuing
year
it
will
meet
the
moon
four
days
after
its
discharge
precisely
at
midnight
on
the
of
december
at
the
moment
of
its
transit
across
the
zenith
the
members
of
the
gun
club
ought
therefore
without
delay
to
commence
the
works
necessary
for
such
an
experiment
and
to
be
prepared
to
set
to
work
at
the
moment
determined
upon
for
if
they
should
suffer
this
of
december
to
go
by
they
will
not
find
the
moon
again
under
the
same
conditions
of
perigee
and
of
zenith
until
eighteen
years
and
eleven
days
afterward
the
staff
of
the
cambridge
observatory
place
themselves
entirely
at
their
disposal
in
respect
of
all
questions
of
theoretical
astronomy
and
herewith
add
their
congratulations
to
those
of
all
the
rest
of
america
for
the
astronomical
staff
belfast
of
the
observatory
of
chapter
v
the
romance
of
the
moon
an
observer
endued
with
an
infinite
range
of
vision
and
placed
in
that
unknown
center
around
which
the
entire
world
revolves
might
have
beheld
myriads
of
atoms
filling
all
space
during
the
chaotic
epoch
of
the
universe
little
by
little
as
ages
went
on
a
change
took
place
a
general
law
of
attraction
manifested
itself
to
which
the
hitherto
errant
atoms
became
obedient
these
atoms
combined
together
chemically
according
to
their
affinities
formed
themselves
into
molecules
and
composed
those
nebulous
masses
with
which
the
depths
of
the
heavens
are
strewed
these
masses
became
immediately
endued
with
a
rotary
motion
around
their
own
central
point
this
center
formed
of
indefinite
molecules
began
to
revolve
around
its
own
axis
during
its
gradual
condensation
then
following
the
immutable
laws
of
mechanics
in
proportion
as
its
bulk
diminished
by
condensation
its
rotary
motion
became
accelerated
and
these
two
effects
continuing
the
result
was
the
formation
of
one
principal
star
the
center
of
the
nebulous
mass
by
attentively
watching
the
observer
would
then
have
perceived
the
other
molecules
of
the
mass
following
the
example
of
this
central
star
become
likewise
condensed
by
gradually
accelerated
rotation
and
gravitating
round
it
in
the
shape
of
innumerable
stars
thus
was
formed
the
of
which
astronomers
have
reckoned
up
nearly
among
these
nebulae
there
is
one
which
has
received
the
name
of
the
milky
way
and
which
contains
eighteen
millions
of
stars
each
of
which
has
become
the
center
of
a
solar
world
if
the
observer
had
then
specially
directed
his
attention
to
one
of
the
more
humble
and
less
brilliant
of
these
stellar
bodies
a
star
of
the
fourth
class
that
which
is
arrogantly
called
the
sun
all
the
phenomena
to
which
the
formation
of
the
universe
is
to
be
ascribed
would
have
been
successively
fulfilled
before
his
eyes
in
fact
he
would
have
perceived
this
sun
as
yet
in
the
gaseous
state
and
composed
of
moving
molecules
revolving
round
its
axis
in
order
to
accomplish
its
work
of
concentration
this
motion
faithful
to
the
laws
of
mechanics
would
have
been
accelerated
with
the
diminution
of
its
volume
and
a
moment
would
have
arrived
when
the
centrifugal
force
would
have
overpowered
the
centripetal
which
causes
the
molecules
all
to
tend
toward
the
center
another
phenomenon
would
now
have
passed
before
the
eye
and
the
molecules
situated
on
the
plane
of
the
equator
escaping
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
of
which
the
cord
had
suddenly
snapped
would
have
formed
around
the
sun
sundry
concentric
rings
resembling
that
of
saturn
in
their
turn
again
these
rings
of
cosmical
matter
excited
by
a
rotary
motion
about
the
central
mass
would
have
been
broken
up
and
decomposed
into
secondary
nebulosities
that
is
to
say
into
planets
similarly
he
would
have
observed
these
planets
throw
off
one
or
more
rings
each
which
became
the
origin
of
the
secondary
bodies
which
we
call
satellites
thus
then
advancing
from
atom
to
molecule
from
molecule
to
nebulous
mass
from
that
to
principal
star
from
star
to
sun
from
sun
to
planet
and
hence
to
satellite
we
have
the
whole
series
of
transformations
undergone
by
the
heavenly
bodies
during
the
first
days
of
the
world
now
of
those
attendant
bodies
which
the
sun
maintains
in
their
elliptical
orbits
by
the
great
law
of
gravitation
some
few
in
turn
possess
satellites
uranus
has
eight
saturn
eight
jupiter
four
neptune
possibly
three
and
the
earth
one
this
last
one
of
the
least
important
of
the
entire
solar
system
we
call
the
moon
and
it
is
she
whom
the
daring
genius
of
the
americans
professed
their
intention
of
conquering
the
moon
by
her
comparative
proximity
and
the
constantly
varying
appearances
produced
by
her
several
phases
has
always
occupied
a
considerable
share
of
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
from
the
time
of
thales
of
miletus
in
the
fifth
century
down
to
that
of
copernicus
in
the
fifteenth
and
tycho
brahe
in
the
sixteenth
century
observations
have
been
from
time
to
time
carried
on
with
more
or
less
correctness
until
in
the
present
day
the
altitudes
of
the
lunar
mountains
have
been
determined
with
exactitude
galileo
explained
the
phenomena
of
the
lunar
light
produced
during
certain
of
her
phases
by
the
existence
of
mountains
to
which
he
assigned
a
mean
altitude
of
feet
after
him
hevelius
an
astronomer
of
dantzic
reduced
the
highest
elevations
to
feet
but
the
calculations
of
riccioli
brought
them
up
again
to
feet
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
herschel
armed
with
a
powerful
telescope
considerably
reduced
the
preceding
measurements
he
assigned
a
height
of
feet
to
the
maximum
elevations
and
reduced
the
mean
of
the
different
altitudes
to
little
more
than
feet
but
herschel
calculations
were
in
their
turn
corrected
by
the
observations
of
halley
nasmyth
bianchini
gruithuysen
and
others
but
it
was
reserved
for
the
labors
of
boeer
and
maedler
finally
to
solve
the
question
they
succeeded
in
measuring
different
elevations
of
which
six
exceed
feet
and
exceed
feet
the
highest
summit
of
all
towers
to
a
height
of
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
lunar
disc
at
the
same
period
the
examination
of
the
moon
was
completed
she
appeared
completely
riddled
with
craters
and
her
essentially
volcanic
character
was
apparent
at
each
observation
by
the
absence
of
refraction
in
the
rays
of
the
planets
occulted
by
her
we
conclude
that
she
is
absolutely
devoid
of
an
atmosphere
the
absence
of
air
entails
the
absence
of
water
it
became
therefore
manifest
that
the
selenites
to
support
life
under
such
conditions
must
possess
a
special
organization
of
their
own
must
differ
remarkably
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
at

to
modern

searched
the

without
intermission
not
leaving
a
single
point
of
her
surface
unexplored
and
notwithstanding
that
her
diameter
measures
miles
her
surface
equals
the
part
of
that
of
our
globe
and
her
bulk
the
part
of
that
of
the
terrestrial
spheroid
not
one
of
her
secrets
was
able
to
escape
the
eyes
of
the
astronomers
and
these
skillful
men
of
science
carried
to
an
even
greater
degree
their
prodigious
observations
thus
they
remarked
that
during
full
moon
the
disc
appeared
scored
in
certain
parts
with
white
lines
and
during
the
phases
with
black
on
prosecuting
the
study
of
these
with
still
greater
precision
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
exact
account
of
the
nature
of
these
lines
they
were
long
and
narrow
furrows
sunk
between
parallel
ridges
bordering
generally
upon
the
edges
of
the
craters
their
length
varied
between
ten
and
miles
and
their
width
was
about
yards
astronomers
called
them
chasms
but
they
could
not
get
any
further
whether
these
chasms
were
the
beds
of
ancient
rivers
or
not
they
were
unable
thoroughly
to
ascertain
the
americans
among
others
hoped
one
day
or
other
to
determine
this
geological
question
they
also
undertook
to
examine
the
true
nature
of
that
system
of
parallel
ramparts
discovered
on
the
moon
surface
by
gruithuysen
a
learned
professor
of
munich
who
considered
them
to
be
a
system
of
fortifications
thrown
up
by
the
selenitic
engineers
these
two
points
yet
obscure
as
well
as
others
no
doubt
could
not
be
definitely
settled
except
by
direct
communication
with
the
moon
regarding
the
degree
of
intensity
of
its
light
there
was
nothing
more
to
learn
on
this
point
it
was
known
that
it
is
times
weaker
than
that
of
the
sun
and
that
its
heat
has
no
appreciable
effect
upon
the
thermometer
as
to
the
phenomenon
known
as
the
ashy
light
it
is
explained
naturally
by
the
effect
of
the
transmission
of
the
solar
rays
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
which
give
the
appearance
of
completeness
to
the
lunar
disc
while
it
presents
itself
under
the
crescent
form
during
its
first
and
last
phases
such
was
the
state
of
knowledge
acquired

published
by
them
and
commented
upon
with
unreserved
approval
until
that
time
most
people
had
been
ignorant
of
the
mode
in
which
the
distance
which
separates
the
moon
from
the
earth
is
calculated
they
took
advantage
of
this
fact
to
explain
to
them
that
this
distance
was
obtained
by
measuring
the
parallax
of
the
moon
the
term
parallax
proving
caviare
to
the
general
they
further
explained
that
it
meant
the
angle
formed
by
the
inclination
of
two
straight
lines
drawn
from
either
extremity
of
the
earth
radius
to
the
moon
on
doubts
being
expressed
as
to
the
correctness
of
this
method
they
immediately
proved
that
not
only
was
the
mean
distance
miles
but
that
astronomers
could
not
possibly
be
in
error
in
their
estimate
by
more
than
seventy
miles
either
way
to
those
who
were
not
familiar
with
the
motions
of
the
moon
they
demonstrated
that
she
possesses
two
distinct
motions
the
first
being
that
of
rotation
upon
her
axis
the
second
being
that
of
revolution
round
the
earth
accomplishing
both
together
in
an
equal
period
of
time
that
is
to
say
in
and
days
the
motion
of
rotation
is
that
which
produces
day
and
night
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
save
that
there
is
only
one
day
and
one
night
in
the
lunar
month
each
lasting
three
hundred
and
and
hours
but
happily
for
her
the
face
turned
toward
the
terrestrial
globe
is
illuminated
by
it
with
an
intensity
equal
to
that
of
fourteen
moons
as
to
the
other
face
always
invisible
to
us
it
has
of
necessity
three
hundred
and
hours
of
absolute
night
tempered
only
by
that
pale
glimmer
which
falls
upon
it
from
the
stars
some
but
rather
obstinate
persons
could
not
at
first
comprehend
how
if
the
moon
displays
invariably
the
same
face
to
the
earth
during
her
revolution
she
can
describe
one
turn
round
herself
to
such
they
answered
go
into
your
and
walk
round
the
table
in
such
a
way
as
to
always
keep
your
face
turned
toward
the
center
by
the
time
you
will
have
achieved
one
complete
round
you
will
have
completed
one
turn
around
yourself
since
your
eye
will
have
traversed
successively
every
point
of
the
room
well
then
the
room
is
the
heavens
the
table
is
the
earth
and
the
moon
is
yourself
and
they
would
go
away
delighted
so
then
the
moon
displays
invariably
the
same
face
to
the
earth
nevertheless
to
be
quite
exact
it
is
necessary
to
add
that
in
consequence
of
certain
fluctuations
of
north
and
south
and
of
west
and
east
termed
her
libration
she
permits
rather
more
than
half
that
is
to
say
to
be
seen
as
soon
as
the
ignoramuses
came
to
understand
as
much
as
the
director
of
the
observatory
himself
knew
they
began
to
worry
themselves
regarding
her
revolution
round
the
earth
whereupon
twenty
scientific
reviews
immediately
came
to
the
rescue
they
pointed
out
to
them
that
the
firmament
with
its
infinitude
of
stars
may
be
considered
as
one
vast
upon
which
the
moon
travels
indicating
the
true
time
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
it
is
during
this
movement
that
the
queen
of
night
exhibits
her
different
phases
that
the
moon
is
when
she
is
in
with
the
sun
that
is
when
the
three
bodies
are
on
the
same
straight
line
the
earth
occupying
the
center
that
she
is
when
she
is
in
with
the
sun
that
is
when
she
is
between
it
and
the
earth
and
lastly
that
she
is
in
her
or
quarter
when
she
makes
with
the
sun
and
the
earth
an
angle
of
which
she
herself
occupies
the
apex
regarding
the
altitude
which
the
moon
attains
above
the
horizon
the
letter
of
the
cambridge
observatory
had
said
all
that
was
to
be
said
in
this
respect
every
one
knew
that
this
altitude
varies
according
to
the
latitude
of
the
observer
but
the
only
zones
of
the
globe
in
which
the
moon
passes
the
zenith
that
is
the
point
directly
over
the
head
of
the
spectator
are
of
necessity
comprised
between
the
parallels
and
the
equator
hence
the
importance
of
the
advice
to
try
the
experiment
upon
some
point
of
that
part
of
the
globe
in
order
that
the
projectile
might
be
discharged
perpendicularly
and
so
the
soonest
escape
the
action
of
gravitation
this
was
an
essential
condition
to
the
success
of
the
enterprise
and
continued
actively
to
engage
the
public
attention
regarding
the
path
described
by
the
moon
in
her
revolution
round
the
earth
the
cambridge
observatory
had
demonstrated
that
this
path
is
a
curve
not
a
perfect
circle
but
an
ellipse
of
which
the
earth
occupies
one
of
the
it
was
also
well
understood
that
it
is
farthest
removed
from
the
earth
during
its
and
approaches
most
nearly
to
it
at
its
such
was
then
the
extent
of
knowledge
possessed
by
every
american
on
the
subject
and
of
which
no
one
could
decently
profess
ignorance
still
while
these
principles
were
being
rapidly
disseminated
many
errors
and
illusory
fears
proved
less
easy
to
eradicate
for
instance
some
worthy
persons
maintained
that
the
moon
was
an
ancient
comet
which
in
describing
its
elongated
orbit
round
the
sun
happened
to
pass
near
the
earth
and
became
confined
within
her
circle
of
attraction
these
astronomers
professed
to
explain
the
charred
aspect
of
the
moon
a
disaster
which
they
attributed
to
the
intensity
of
the
solar
heat
only
on
being
reminded
that
comets
have
an
atmosphere
and
that
the
moon
has
little
or
none
they
were
fairly
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
others
again
belonging
to
the
doubting
class
expressed
certain
fears
as
to
the
position
of
the
moon
they
had
heard
it
said
that
according
to
observations
made
in
the
time
of
the
caliphs
her
revolution
had
become
accelerated
in
a
certain
degree
hence
they
concluded
logically
enough
that
an
acceleration
of
motion
ought
to
be
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
diminution
in
the
distance
separating
the
two
bodies
and
that
supposing
the
double
effect
to
be
continued
to
infinity
the
moon
would
end
by
one
day
falling
into
the
earth
however
they
became
reassured
as
to
the
fate
of
future
generations
on
being
apprised
that
according
to
the
calculations
of
laplace
this
acceleration
of
motion
is
confined
within
very
restricted
limits
and
that
a
proportional
diminution
of
speed
will
be
certain
to
succeed
it
so
then
the
stability
of
the
solar
system
would
not
be
deranged
in
ages
to
come
there
remains
but
the
third
class
the
superstitious
these
worthies
were
not
content
merely
to
rest
in
ignorance
they
must
know
all
about
things
which
had
no
existence
whatever
and
as
to
the
moon
they
had
long
known
all
about
her
one
set
regarded
her
disc
as
a
polished
mirror
by
means
of
which
people
could
see
each
other
from
different
points
of
the
earth
and
interchange
their
thoughts
another
set
pretended
that
out
of
one
thousand
new
moons
that
had
been
observed
nine
hundred
and
fifty
had
been
attended
with
remarkable
disturbances
such
as
cataclysms
revolutions
earthquakes
the
deluge
etc
then
they
believed
in
some
mysterious
influence
exercised
by
her
over
human
destinies
that
every
selenite
was
attached
to
some
inhabitant
of
the
earth
by
a
tie
of
sympathy
they
maintained
that
the
entire
vital
system
is
subject
to
her
control
etc
but
in
time
the
majority
renounced
these
vulgar
errors
and
espoused
the
true
side
of
the
question
as
for
the
yankees
they
had
no
other
ambition
than
to
take
possession
of
this
new
continent
of
the
sky
and
to
plant
upon
the
summit
of
its
highest
elevation
the
spangled
banner
of
the
united

of
america
chapter
vii
the
hymn
of
the
the
observatory
of
cambridge
in
its
memorable
letter
had
treated
the
question
from
a
purely
astronomical
point
of
view
the
mechanical
part
still
remained
president
barbicane
had
without
loss
of
time
nominated
a
working
committee
of
the
gun
club
the
duty
of
this
committee
was
to
resolve
the
three
grand
questions
of
the
cannon
the
projectile
and
the
powder
it
was
composed
of
four
members
of
great
technical
knowledge
barbicane
with
a
casting
vote
in
case
of
equality
general
morgan
major
elphinstone
and
maston
to
whom
were
confided
the
functions
of
secretary
on
the
of
october
the
committee
met
at
the
house
of
president
barbicane
republican
street
the
meeting
was
opened
by
the
president
himself
gentlemen
said
he
we
have
to
resolve
one
of
the
most
important
problems
in
the
whole
of
the
noble
science
of
gunnery
it
might
appear
perhaps
the
most
logical
course
to
devote
our
first
meeting
to
the
discussion
of
the
engine
to
be
employed
nevertheless
after
mature
consideration
it
has
appeared
to
me
that
the
question
of
the
projectile
must
take
precedence
of
that
of
the
cannon
and
that
the
dimensions
of
the
latter
must
necessarily
depend
on
those
of
the
former
suffer
me
to
say
a
word
here
broke
in
maston
permission
having
been
granted
gentlemen
said
he
with
an
inspired
accent
our
president
is
right
in
placing
the
question
of
the
projectile
above
all
others
the
ball
we
are
about
to
discharge
at
the
moon
is
our
ambassador
to
her
and
i
wish
to
consider
it
from
a
moral
point
of
view
the
gentlemen
to
my
mind
is
the
most
magnificent
manifestation
of
human
power
if
providence
has
created
the
stars
and
the
planets
man
has
called
the
into
existence
let
providence
claim
the
swiftness
of
electricity
and
of
light
of
the
stars
the
comets
and
the
planets
of
wind
and
sound
we
claim
to
have
invented
the
swiftness
of
the
a
hundred
times
superior
to
that
of
the
swiftest
horses
or
railway
train
how
glorious
will
be
the
moment
when
infinitely
exceeding
all
hitherto
attained
velocities
we
shall
launch
our
new
projectile
with
the
rapidity
of
seven
miles
a
second
shall
it
not
gentlemen
shall
it
not
be
received
up
there
with
the
honors
due
to
a
terrestrial
ambassador
overcome
with
emotion
the
orator
sat
down
and
applied
himself
to
a
huge
plate
of
sandwiches
before
him
and
now
said
barbicane
let
us
quit
the
domain
of
poetry
and
come
direct
to
the
question
by
all
means
replied
the
members
each
with
his
mouth
full
of
sandwich
the
problem
before
us
continued
the
president
is
how
to
communicate
to
a
projectile
a
velocity
of
yards
per
second
let
us
at
present
examine
the
velocities
hitherto
attained
general
morgan
will
be
able
to
enlighten
us
on
this
point
and
the
more
easily
replied
the
general
that
during
the
war
i
was
a
member
of
the
committee
of
experiments
i
may
say
then
that
the
dahlgrens
which
carried
a
distance
of
yards
impressed
upon
their
projectile
an
initial
velocity
of
yards
a
second
the
rodman
columbiad
threw
a
shot
weighing
half
a
ton
a
distance
of
six
miles
with
a
velocity
of
yards
per
second
a
result
which
armstrong
and
palisser
have
never
obtained
in
england
this
replied
barbicane
is
i
believe
the
maximum
velocity
ever
attained
it
is
so
replied
the
general
ah
groaned
maston
if
my
mortar
had
not
burst
yes
quietly
replied
barbicane
but
it
did
burst
we
must
take
then
for
our
starting
point
this
velocity
of
yards
we
must
increase
it
now
reserving
for
another
discussion
the
means
of
producing
this
velocity
i
will
call
your
attention
to
the
dimensions
which
it
will
be
proper
to
assign
to
the
shot
you
understand
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
here
with
projectiles
weighing
at
most
but
half
a
ton
why
not
demanded
the
major
because
the
shot
quickly
replied
maston
must
be
big
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
if
there
are
any
yes
replied
barbicane
and
for
another
reason
more
important
still
what
mean
you
asked
the
major
i
mean
that
it
is
not
enough
to
discharge
a
projectile
and
then
take
no
further
notice
of
it
we
must
follow
it
throughout
its
course
up
to
the
moment
when
it
shall
reach
its
goal
what
shouted
the
general
and
the
major
in
great
surprise
undoubtedly
replied
barbicane
composedly
or
our
experiment
would
produce
no
result
but
then
replied
the
major
you
will
have
to
give
this
projectile
enormous
dimensions
no
be
so
good
as
to
listen
you
know
that
optical
instruments
have
acquired
great
perfection
with
certain
instruments
we
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
enlargements
of
times
and
reducing
the
moon
to
within
forty
miles
distance
now
at
this
distance
any
objects
sixty
feet
square
would
be
perfectly
visible
if
then
the
penetrative
power
of
telescopes
has
not
been
further
increased
it
is
because
that
power
detracts
from
their
light
and
the
moon
which
is
but
a
reflecting
mirror
does
not
give
back
sufficient
light
to
enable
us
to
perceive
objects
of
lesser
magnitude
well
then
what
do
you
propose
to
do
asked
the
general
would
you
give
your
projectile
a
diameter
of
sixty
feet
not
so
do
you
intend
then
to
increase
the
luminous
power
of
the
moon
exactly
so
if
i
can
succeed
in
diminishing
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
through
which
the
moon
light
has
to
travel
i
shall
have
rendered
her
light
more
intense
to
effect
that
object
it
will
be
enough
to
establish
a
telescope
on
some
elevated
mountain
that
is
what
we
will
do
i
give
it
up
answered
the
major
you
have
such
a
way
of
simplifying
things
and
what
enlargement
do
you
expect
to
obtain
in
this
way
one
of
times
which
should
bring
the
moon
within
an
apparent
distance
of
five
miles
and
in
order
to
be
visible
objects
need
not
have
a
diameter
of
more
than
nine
feet
so
then
cried
maston
our
projectile
need
not
be
more
than
nine
feet
in
diameter
let
me
observe
however
interrupted
major
elphinstone
this
will
involve
a
weight
such
as
my
dear
major
replied
barbicane
before
discussing
its
weight
permit
me
to
enumerate
some
of
the
marvels
which
our
ancestors
have
achieved
in
this
respect
i
do
mean
to
pretend
that
the
science
of
gunnery
has
not
advanced
but
it
is
as
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
during
the
middle
ages
they
obtained
results
more
surprising
i
will
venture
to
say
than
ours
for
instance
during
the
siege
of
constantinople
by
mahomet
in
stone
shot
of
pounds
weight
were
employed
at
malta
in
the
time
of
the
knights
there
was
a
gun
of
the
fortress
of
elmo
which
threw
a
projectile
weighing
pounds
and
now
what
is
the
extent
of
what
we
have
seen
ourselves
armstrong
guns
discharging
shot
of
pounds
and
the
rodman
guns
projectiles
of
half
a
ton
it
seems
then
that
if
projectiles
have
gained
in
range
they
have
lost
far
more
in
weight
now
if
we
turn
our
efforts
in
that
direction
we
ought
to
arrive
with
the
progress
on
science
at
ten
times
the
weight
of
the
shot
of
mahomet
ii
and
the
knights
of
malta
clearly
replied
the
major
but
what
metal
do
you
calculate
upon
employing
simply
cast
iron
said
general
morgan
but
interrupted
the
major
since
the
weight
of
a
shot
is
proportionate
to
its
volume
an
iron
ball
of
nine
feet
in
diameter
would
be
of
tremendous
weight
yes
if
it
were
solid
not
if
it
were
hollow
hollow
then
it
would
be
a
shell
yes
a
shell
replied
barbicane
decidely
it
must
be
a
solid
shot
of
inches
would
weigh
more
than
pounds
a
weight
evidently
far
too
great
still
as
we
must
reserve
a
certain
stability
for
our
projectile
i
propose
to
give
it
a
weight
of
pounds
what
then
will
be
the
thickness
of
the
sides
asked
the
major
if
we
follow
the
usual
proportion
replied
morgan
a
diameter
of
inches
would
require
sides
of
two
feet
thickness
or
less
that
would
be
too
much
replied
barbicane
for
you
will
observe
that
the
question
is
not
that
of
a
shot
intended
to
pierce
an
iron
plate
it
will
suffice
to
give
it
sides
strong
enough
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
gas
the
problem
therefore
is
this
what
thickness
ought
a
shell
to
have
in
order
not
to
weight
more
than
pounds
our
clever
secretary
will
soon
enlighten
us
upon
this
point
nothing
easier
replied
the
worthy
secretary
of
the
committee
and
rapidly
tracing
a
few
algebraical
formulae
upon
paper
among
which
and
frequently
appeared
he
presently
said
the
sides
will
require
a
thickness
of
less
than
two
inches
will
that
be
enough
asked
the
major
doubtfully
clearly
not
replied
the
president
what
is
to
be
done
then
said
elphinstone
with
a
puzzled
air
employ
another
metal
instead
of
iron
copper
said
morgan
no
that
would
be
too
heavy
i
have
better
than
that
to
offer
what
then
asked
the
major
aluminum
replied
barbicane
aluminum
cried
his
three
colleagues
in
chorus
unquestionably
my
friends
this
valuable
metal
possesses
the
whiteness
of
silver
the
indestructibility
of
gold
the
tenacity
of
iron
the
fusibility
of
copper
the
lightness
of
glass
it
is
easily
wrought
is
very
widely
distributed
forming
the
base
of
most
of
the
rocks
is
three
times
lighter
than
iron
and
seems
to
have
been
created
for
the
express
purpose
of
furnishing
us
with
the
material
for
our
projectile
but
my
dear
president
said
the
major
is
not
the
cost
price
of
aluminum
extremely
high
it
was
so
at
its
first
discovery
but
it
has
fallen
now
to
nine
dollars
a
pound
but
still
nine
dollars
a
pound
replied
the
major
who
was
not
willing
readily
to
give
in
even
that
is
an
enormous
price
undoubtedly
my
dear
major
but
not
beyond
our
reach
what
will
the
projectile
weigh
then
asked
morgan
here
is
the
result
of
my
calculations
replied
barbicane
a
shot
of
inches
in
diameter
and
twelve
inches
in
thickness
would
weigh
in
pounds
cast
in
aluminum
its
weight
will
be
reduced
to
pounds
capital
cried
the
major
but
do
you
know
that
at
nine
dollars
a
pound
this
projectile
will
cost
one
hundred
and
thousand
and
fifty
dollars
i
know
it
quite
well
but
fear
not
my
friends
the
money
will
not
be
wanting
for
our
enterprise
i
will
answer
for
it
now
what
say
you
to
aluminum
gentlemen
adopted
replied
the
three
members
of
the
committee
so
ended
the
first
meeting
the
question
of
the
projectile
was
definitely
settled
chapter
vii
history
of
the
cannon
the
resolutions
passed
at
the
last
meeting
produced
a
great
effect
out
of
doors
timid
people
took
fright
at
the
idea
of
a
shot
weighing
pounds
being
launched
into
space
they
asked
what
cannon
could
ever
transmit
a
sufficient
velocity
to
such
a
mighty
mass
the
minutes
of
the
second
meeting
were
destined
triumphantly
to
answer
such
questions
the
following
evening
the
discussion
was
renewed
my
dear
colleagues
said
barbicane
without
further
preamble
the
subject
now
before
us
is
the
construction
of
the
engine
its
length
its
composition
and
its
weight
it
is
probable
that
we
shall
end
by
giving
it
gigantic
dimensions
but
however
great
may
be
the
difficulties
in
the
way
our
mechanical
genius
will
readily
surmount
them
be
good
enough
then
to
give
me
your
attention
and
do
not
hesitate
to
make
objections
at
the
close
i
have
no
fear
of
them
the
problem
before
us
is
how
to
communicate
an
initial
force
of
yards
per
second
to
a
shell
of
inches
in
diameter
weighing
pounds
now
when
a
projectile
is
launched
into
space
what
happens
to
it
it
is
acted
upon
by
three
independent
forces
the
resistance
of
the
air
the
attraction
of
the
earth
and
the
force
of
impulsion
with
which
it
is
endowed
let
us
examine
these
three
forces
the
resistance
of
the
air
is
of
little
importance
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
does
not
exceed
forty
miles
now
with
the
given
rapidity
the
projectile
will
have
traversed
this
in
five
seconds
and
the
period
is
too
brief
for
the
resistance
of
the
medium
to
be
regarded
otherwise
than
as
insignificant
proceding
then
to
the
attraction
of
the
earth
that
is
the
weight
of
the
shell
we
know
that
this
weight
will
diminish
in
the
inverse
ratio
of
the
square
of
the
distance
when
a
body
left
to
itself
falls
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
falls
five
feet
in
the
first
second
and
if
the
same
body
were
removed
miles
further
off
in
other
words
to
the
distance
of
the
moon
its
fall
would
be
reduced
to
about
half
a
line
in
the
first
second
that
is
almost
equivalent
to
a
state
of
perfect
rest
our
business
then
is
to
overcome
progressively
this
action
of
gravitation
the
mode
of
accomplishing
that
is
by
the
force
of
impulsion
there
the
difficulty
broke
in
the
major
true
replied
the
president
but
we
will
overcome
that
for
the
force
of
impulsion
will
depend
on
the
length
of
the
engine
and
the
powder
employed
the
latter
being
limited
only
by
the
resisting
power
of
the
former
our
business
then
is
with
the
dimensions
of
the
cannon
now
up
to
the
present
time
said
barbicane
our
longest
guns
have
not
exceeded
feet
in
length
we
shall
therefore
astonish
the
world
by
the
dimensions
we
shall
be
obliged
to
adopt
it
must
evidently
be
then
a
gun
of
great
range
since
the
length
of
the
piece
will
increase
the
detention
of
the
gas
accumulated
behind
the
projectile
but
there
is
no
advantage
in
passing
certain
limits
quite
so
said
the
major
what
is
the
rule
in
such
a
case
ordinarily
the
length
of
a
gun
is
twenty
to
times
the
diameter
of
the
shot
and
its
weight
two
hundred
and
to
two
hundred
and
forty
times
that
of
the
shot
that
is
not
enough
cried
maston
impetuously
i
agree
with
you
my
good
friend
and
in
fact
following
this
proportion
for
a
projectile
nine
feet
in
diameter
weighing
pounds
the
gun
would
only
have
a
length
of
two
hundred
and
five
feet
and
a
weight
of
pounds
ridiculous
rejoined
maston
as
well
take
a
pistol
i
think
so
too
replied
barbicane
that
is
why
i
propose
to
quadruple
that
length
and
to
construct
a
gun
of
nine
hundred
feet
the
general
and
the
major
offered
some
objections
nevertheless
the
proposition
actively
supported
by
the
secretary
was
definitely
adopted
but
said
elphinstone
what
thickness
must
we
give
it
a
thickness
of
six
feet
replied
barbicane
you
surely
do
think
of
mounting
a
mass
like
that
upon
a
carriage
asked
the
major
it
would
be
a
superb
idea
though
said
maston
but
impracticable
replied
barbicane
no
i
think
of
sinking
this
engine
in
the
earth
alone
binding
it
with
hoops
of
wrought
iron
and
finally
surrounding
it
with
a
thick
mass
of
masonry
of
stone
and
cement
the
piece
once
cast
it
must
be
bored
with
great
precision
so
as
to
preclude
any
possible
windage
so
there
will
be
no
loss
whatever
of
gas
and
all
the
expansive
force
of
the
powder
will
be
employed
in
the
propulsion
one
simple
question
said
elphinstone
is
our
gun
to
be
rifled
no
certainly
not
replied
barbicane
we
require
an
enormous
initial
velocity
and
you
are
well
aware
that
a
shot
quits
a
rifled
gun
less
rapidly
than
it
does
a
true
rejoined
the
major
the
committee
here
adjourned
for
a
few
minutes
to
tea
and
sandwiches
on
the
discussion
being
renewed
gentlemen
said
barbicane
we
must
now
take
into
consideration
the
metal
to
be
employed
our
cannon
must
be
possessed
of
great
tenacity
great
hardness
be
infusible
by
heat
indissoluble
and
inoxidable
by
the
corrosive
action
of
acids
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
replied
the
major
and
as
we
shall
have
to
employ
an
immense
quantity
of
metal
we
shall
not
be
at
a
loss
for
choice
well
then
said
morgan
i
propose
the
best
alloy
hitherto
known
which
consists
of
one
hundred
parts
of
copper
twelve
of
tin
and
six
of
brass
i
admit
replied
the
president
that
this
composition
has
yielded
excellent
results
but
in
the
present
case
it
would
be
too
expensive
and
very
difficult
to
work
i
think
then
that
we
ought
to
adopt
a
material
excellent
in
its
way
and
of
low
price
such
as
cast
iron
what
is
your
advice
major
i
quite
agree
with
you
replied
elphinstone
in
fact
continued
barbicane
cast
iron
costs
ten
times
less
than
bronze
it
is
easy
to
cast
it
runs
readily
from
the
moulds
of
sand
it
is
easy
of
manipulation
it
is
at
once
economical
of
money
and
of
time
in
addition
it
is
excellent
as
a
material
and
i
well
remember
that
during
the
war
at
the
siege
of
atlanta
some
iron
guns
fired
one
thousand
rounds
at
intervals
of
twenty
minutes
without
injury
cast
iron
is
very
brittle
though
replied
morgan
yes
but
it
possesses
great
resistance
i
will
now
ask
our
worthy
secretary
to
calculate
the
weight
of
a
gun
with
a
bore
of
nine
feet
and
a
thickness
of
six
feet
of
metal
in
a
moment
replied
maston
then
dashing
off
some
algebraical
formulae
with
marvelous
facility
in
a
minute
or
two
he
declared
the
following
result
the
cannon
will
weigh
tons
and
at
two
cents
a
pound
it
will
cost
two
million
five
hundred
and
ten
thousand
seven
hundred
and
one
dollars
maston
the
major
and
the
general
regarded
barbicane
with
uneasy
looks
well
gentlemen
replied
the
president
i
repeat
what
i
said
yesterday
make
yourselves
easy
the
millions
will
not
be
wanting
with
this
assurance
of
their
president
the
committee
separated
after
having
fixed
their
third
meeting
for
the
following
evening
chapter
ix
the
question
of
the
powders
there
remained
for
consideration
merely
the
question
of
powders
the
public
awaited
with
interest
its
final
decision
the
size
of
the
projectile
the
length
of
the
cannon
being
settled
what
would
be
the
quantity
of
powder
necessary
to
produce
impulsion
it
is
generally
asserted
that
gunpowder
was
invented
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
the
monk
schwartz
who
paid
for
his
grand
discovery
with
his
life
it
is
however
pretty
well
proved
that
this
story
ought
to
be
ranked
among
the
legends
of
the
middle
ages
gunpowder
was
not
invented
by
any
one
it
was
the
lineal
successor
of
the
greek
fire
which
like
itself
was
composed
of
sulfur
and
saltpeter
few
persons
are
acquainted
with
the
mechanical
power
of
gunpowder
now
this
is
precisely
what
is
necessary
to
be
understood
in
order
to
comprehend
the
importance
of
the
question
submitted
to
the
committee
a
litre
of
gunpowder
weighs
about
two
pounds
during
combustion
it
produces
litres
of
gas
this
gas
on
being
liberated
and
acted
upon
by
temperature
raised
to
degrees
occupies
a
space
of
litres
consequently
the
volume
of
powder
is
to
the
volume
of
gas
produced
by
its
combustion
as
to
one
may
judge
therefore
of
the
tremendous
pressure
on
this
gas
when
compressed
within
a
space
times
too
confined
all
this
was
of
course
well
known
to
the
members
of
the
committee
when
they
met
on
the
following
evening
the
first
speaker
on
this
occasion
was
major
elphinstone
who
had
been
the
director
of
the
gunpowder
factories
during
the
war
gentlemen
said
this
distinguished
chemist
i
begin
with
some
figures
which
will
serve
as
the
basis
of
our
calculation
the
old
shot
required
for
its
discharge
sixteen
pounds
of
powder
you
are
certain
of
this
amount
broke
in
barbicane
quite
certain
replied
the
major
the
armstrong
cannon
employs
only
pounds
of
powder
for
a
projectile
of
eight
hundred
pounds
and
the
rodman
columbiad
uses
only
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
powder
to
send
its
half
ton
shot
a
distance
of
six
miles
these
facts
can
not
be
called
in
question
for
i
myself
raised
the
point
during
the
depositions
taken
before
the
committee
of
artillery
quite
true
said
the
general
well
replied
the
major
these
figures
go
to
prove
that
the
quantity
of
powder
is
not
increased
with
the
weight
of
the
shot
that
is
to
say
if
a
shot
requires
sixteen
pounds
of
powder
in
other
words
if
in
ordinary
guns
we
employ
a
quantity
of
powder
equal
to
of
the
weight
of
the
projectile
this
proportion
is
not
constant
calculate
and
you
will
see
that
in
place
of
three
hundred
and
pounds
of
powder
the
quantity
is
reduced
to
no
more
than
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
what
are
you
aiming
at
asked
the
president
if
you
push
your
theory
to
extremes
my
dear
major
said
maston
you
will
get
to
this
that
as
soon
as
your
shot
becomes
sufficiently
heavy
you
will
not
require
any
powder
at
all
our
friend
maston
is
always
at
his
jokes
even
in
serious
matters
cried
the
major
but
let
him
make
his
mind
easy
i
am
going
presently
to
propose
gunpowder
enough
to
satisfy
his
artillerist
propensities
i
only
keep
to
statistical
facts
when
i
say
that
during
the
war
and
for
the
very
largest
guns
the
weight
of
the
powder
was
reduced
as
the
result
of
experience
to
a
tenth
part
of
the
weight
of
the
shot
perfectly
correct
said
morgan
but
before
deciding
the
quantity
of
powder
necessary
to
give
the
impulse
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
we
shall
have
to
employ
a
powder
continued
the
major
its
combustion
is
more
rapid
than
that
of
the
small
no
doubt
about
that
replied
morgan
but
it
is
very
destructive
and
ends
by
enlarging
the
bore
of
the
pieces
granted
but
that
which
is
injurious
to
a
gun
destined
to
perform
long
service
is
not
so
to
our
columbiad
we
shall
run
no
danger
of
an
explosion
and
it
is
necessary
that
our
powder
should
take
fire
instantaneously
in
order
that
its
mechanical
effect
may
be
complete
we
must
have
said
maston
several
so
as
to
fire
it
at
different
points
at
the
same
time
certainly
replied
elphinstone
but
that
will
render
the
working
of
the
piece
more
difficult
i
return
then
to
my
powder
which
removes
those
difficulties
in
his
columbiad
charges
rodman
employed
a
powder
as
large
as
chestnuts
made
of
willow
charcoal
simply
dried
in
iron
pans
this
powder
was
hard
and
glittering
left
no
trace
upon
the
hand
contained
hydrogen
and
oxygen
in
large
proportion
took
fire
instantaneously
and
though
very
destructive
did
not
sensibly
injure
the
up
to
this
point
barbicane
had
kept
aloof
from
the
discussion
he
left
the
others
to
speak
while
he
himself
listened
he
had
evidently
got
an
idea
he
now
simply
said
well
my
friends
what
quantity
of
powder
do
you
propose
the
three
members
looked
at
one
another
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
at
last
said
morgan
five
hundred
thousand
added
the
major
eight
hundred
thousand
screamed
maston
a
moment
of
silence
followed
this
triple
proposal
it
was
at
last
broken
by
the
president
gentlemen
he
quietly
said
i
start
from
this
principle
that
the
resistance
of
a
gun
constructed
under
the
given
conditions
is
unlimited
i
shall
surprise
our
friend
maston
then
by
stigmatizing
his
calculations
as
timid
and
i
propose
to
double
his
pounds
of
powder
sixteen
hundred
thousand
pounds
shouted
maston
leaping
from
his
seat
just
so
we
shall
have
to
come
then
to
my
ideal
of
a
cannon
half
a
mile
long
for
you
see
pounds
will
occupy
a
space
of
about
cubic
feet
and
since
the
contents
of
your
cannon
do
not
exceed
cubic
feet
it
would
be
half
full
and
the
bore
will
not
be
more
than
long
enough
for
the
gas
to
communicate
to
the
projectile
sufficient
impulse
nevertheless
said
the
president
i
hold
to
that
quantity
of
powder
now
pounds
of
powder
will
create
litres
of
gas
six
thousand
millions
you
quite
understand
what
is
to
be
done
then
said
the
general
the
thing
is
very
simple
we
must
reduce
this
enormous
quantity
of
powder
while
preserving
to
it
its
mechanical
power
good
but
by
what
means
i
am
going
to
tell
you
replied
barbicane
quietly
nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
reduce
this
mass
to
one
quarter
of
its
bulk
you
know
that
curious
cellular
matter
which
constitutes
the
elementary
tissues
of
vegetable
this
substance
is
found
quite
pure
in
many
bodies
especially
in
cotton
which
is
nothing
more
than
the
down
of
the
seeds
of
the
cotton
plant
now
cotton
combined
with
cold
nitric
acid
become
transformed
into
a
substance
eminently
insoluble
combustible
and
explosive
it
was
first
discovered
in
by
braconnot
a
french
chemist
who
called
it
xyloidine

investigated
its
different
properties
and
finally
in
schonbein
professor
of
chemistry
at
bale
proposed
its
employment
for
purposes
of
war
this
powder
now
called
pyroxyle
or
fulminating
cotton
is
prepared
with
great
facility
by
simply
plunging
cotton
for
fifteen
minutes
in
nitric
acid
then
washing
it
in
water
then
drying
it
and
it
is
ready
for
use
nothing
could
be
more
simple
said
morgan
moreover
pyroxyle
is
unaltered
by
moisture
a
valuable
property
to
us
inasmuch
as
it
would
take
several
days
to
charge
the
cannon
it
ignites
at
degrees
in
place
of
and
its
combustion
is
so
rapid
that
one
may
set
light
to
it
on
the
top
of
the
ordinary
powder
without
the
latter
having
time
to
ignite
perfect
exclaimed
the
major
only
it
is
more
expensive
what
matter
cried
maston
finally
it
imparts
to
projectiles
a
velocity
four
times
superior
to
that
of
gunpowder
i
will
even
add
that
if
we
mix
it
with
of
its
own
weight
of
nitrate
of
potassium
its
expansive
force
is
again
considerably
augmented
will
that
be
necessary
asked
the
major
i
think
not
replied
barbicane
so
then
in
place
of
pounds
of
powder
we
shall
have
but
pounds
of
fulminating
cotton
and
since
we
can
without
danger
compress
pounds
of
cotton
into
cubic
feet
the
whole
quantity
will
not
occupy
a
height
of
more
than
feet
within
the
bore
of
the
columbiad
in
this
way
the
shot
will
have
more
than
feet
of
bore
to
traverse
under
a
force
of
litres
of
gas
before
taking
its
flight
toward
the
moon
at
this
juncture
maston
could
not
repress
his
emotion
he
flung
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
friend
with
the
violence
of
a
projectile
and
barbicane
would
have
been
stove
in
if
he
had
not
been
this
incident
terminated
the
third
meeting
of
the
committee
barbicane
and
his
bold
colleagues
to
whom
nothing
seemed
impossible
had
succeeding
in
solving
the
complex
problems
of
projectile
cannon
and
powder
their
plan
was
drawn
up
and
it
only
remained
to
put
it
into
execution
a
mere
matter
of
detail
a
bagatelle
said

chapter
x
one
enemy
millions
of
friends
the
american
public
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
smallest
details
of
the
enterprise
of
the
gun
club
it
followed
day
by
day
the
discussion
of
the
committee
the
most
simple
preparations
for
the
great
experiment
the
questions
of
figures
which
it
involved
the
mechanical
difficulties
to
be
resolved
in
one
word
the
entire
plan
of
work
roused
the
popular
excitement
to
the
highest
pitch
the
purely
scientific
attraction
was
suddenly
intensified
by
the
following
incident
we
have
seen
what
legions
of
admirers
and
friends
project
had
rallied
round
its
author
there
was
however
one
single
individual
alone
in
all
the
states
of
the
union
who
protested
against
the
attempt
of
the
gun
club
he
attacked
it
furiously
on
every
opportunity
and
human
nature
is
such
that
barbicane
felt
more
keenly
the
opposition
of
that
one
man
than
he
did
the
applause
of
all
the
others
he
was
well
aware
of
the
motive
of
this
antipathy
the
origin
of
this
solitary
enmity
the
cause
of
its
personality
and
old
standing
and
in
what
rivalry
of
it
had
its
rise
this
persevering
enemy
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
never
seen
fortunate
that
it
was
so
for
a
meeting
between
the
two
men
would
certainly
have
been
attended
with
serious
consequences
this
rival
was
a
man
of
science
like
barbicane
himself
of
a
fiery
daring
and
violent
disposition
a
pure
yankee
his
name
was
captain
nicholl
he
lived
at
philadelphia
most
people
are
aware
of
the
curious
struggle
which
arose
during
the
federal
war
between
the
guns
and
armor
of
ships
the
result
was
the
entire
reconstruction
of
the
navy
of
both
the
continents
as
the
one
grew
heavier
the
other
became
thicker
in
proportion
the
merrimac
the
monitor
the
tennessee
the
weehawken
discharged
enormous
projectiles
themselves
after
having
been
against
the
projectiles
of
others
in
fact
they
did
to
others
that
which
they
would
not
they
should
do
to
them
that
grand
principle
of
immortality
upon
which
rests
the
whole
art
of
war
now
if
barbicane
was
a
great
founder
of
shot
nicholl
was
a
great
forger
of
plates
the
one
cast
night
and
day
at
baltimore
the
other
forged
day
and
night
at
philadelphia
as
soon
as
ever
barbicane
invented
a
new
shot
nicholl
invented
a
new
plate
each
followed
a
current
of
ideas
essentially
opposed
to
the
other
happily
for
these
citizens
so
useful
to
their
country
a
distance
of
from
fifty
to
sixty
miles
separated
them
from
one
another
and
they
had
never
yet
met
which
of
these
two
inventors
had
the
advantage
over
the
other
it
was
difficult
to
decide
from
the
results
obtained
by
last
accounts
however
it
would
seem
that
the
would
in
the
end
have
to
give
way
to
the
shot
nevertheless
there
were
competent
judges
who
had
their
doubts
on
the
point
at
the
last
experiment
the
projectiles
of
barbicane
stuck
like
so
many
pins
in
the
nicholl
plates
on
that
day
the
philadelphia
then
believed
himself
victorious
and
could
not
evince
contempt
enough
for
his
rival
but
when
the
other
afterward
substituted
for
conical
shot
simple
shells
at
very
moderate
velocity
the
captain
was
obliged
to
give
in
in
fact
these
projectiles
knocked
his
best
metal
plate
to
shivers
matters
were
at
this
stage
and
victory
seemed
to
rest
with
the
shot
when
the
war
came
to
an
end
on
the
very
day
when
nicholl
had
completed
a
new
of
wrought
steel
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
its
kind
and
bid
defiance
to
all
the
projectiles
of
the
world
the
captain
had
it
conveyed
to
the
polygon
at
washington
challenging
the
president
of
the
gun
club
to
break
it
barbicane
peace
having
been
declared
declined
to
try
the
experiment
nicholl
now
furious
offered
to
expose
his
plate
to
the
shock
of
any
shot
solid
hollow
round
or
conical
refused
by
the
president
who
did
not
choose
to
compromise
his
last
success
nicholl
disgusted
by
this
obstinacy
tried
to
tempt
barbicane
by
offering
him
every
chance
he
proposed
to
fix
the
plate
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
gun
barbicane
still
obstinate
in
refusal
a
hundred
yards
not
even
at
fifty
then
roared
the
captain
through
the
newspapers
at
yards
and
i
stand
behind
barbicane
returned
for
answer
that
even
if
captain
nicholl
would
be
so
good
as
to
stand
in
front
he
would
not
fire
any
more
nicholl
could
not
contain
himself
at
this
reply
threw
out
hints
of
cowardice
that
a
man
who
refused
to
fire
a
was
pretty
near
being
afraid
of
it
that
artillerists
who
fight
at
six
miles
distance
are
substituting
mathematical
formulae
for
individual
courage
to
these
insinuations
barbicane
returned
no
answer
perhaps
he
never
heard
of
them
so
absorbed
was
he
in
the
calculations
for
his
great
enterprise
when
his
famous
communication
was
made
to
the
gun
club
the
captain
wrath
passed
all
bounds
with
his
intense
jealousy
was
mingled
a
feeling
of
absolute
impotence
how
was
he
to
invent
anything
to
beat
this
columbiad
what
could
ever
resist
a
projectile
of
pounds
weight
overwhelmed
at
first
under
this
violent
shock
he
by
and
by
recovered
himself
and
resolved
to
crush
the
proposal
by
weight
of
his
arguments
he
then
violently
attacked
the
labors
of
the
gun
club
published
a
number
of
letters
in
the
newspapers
endeavored
to
prove
barbicane
ignorant
of
the
first
principles
of
gunnery
he
maintained
that
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
impress
upon
any
body
whatever
a
velocity
of
yards
per
second
that
even
with
such
a
velocity
a
projectile
of
such
a
weight
could
not
transcend
the
limits
of
the
earth
atmosphere
further
still
even
regarding
the
velocity
to
be
acquired
and
granting
it
to
be
sufficient
the
shell
could
not
resist
the
pressure
of
the
gas
developed
by
the
ignition
of
pounds
of
powder
and
supposing
it
to
resist
that
pressure
it
would
be
less
able
to
support
that
temperature
it
would
melt
on
quitting
the
columbiad
and
fall
back
in
a
shower
upon
the
heads
of
the
imprudent
spectators
barbicane
continued
his
work
without
regarding
these
attacks
nicholl
then
took
up
the
question
in
its
other
aspects
without
touching
upon
its
uselessness
in
all
points
of
view
he
regarded
the
experiment
as
fraught
with
extreme
danger
both
to
the
citizens
who
might
sanction
by
their
presence
so
reprehensible
a
spectacle
and
also
to
the
towns
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
deplorable
cannon
he
also
observed
that
if
the
projectile
did
not
succeed
in
reaching
its
destination
a
result
absolutely
impossible
it
must
inevitably
fall
back
upon
the
earth
and
that
the
shock
of
such
a
mass
multiplied
by
the
square
of
its
velocity
would
seriously
endanger
every
point
of
the
globe
under
the
circumstances
therefore
and
without
interfering
with
the
rights
of
free
citizens
it
was
a
case
for
the
intervention
of
government
which
ought
not
to
endanger
the
safety
of
all
for
the
pleasure
of
one
individual
in
spite
of
all
his
arguments
however
captain
nicholl
remained
alone
in
his
opinion
nobody
listened
to
him
and
he
did
not
succeed
in
alienating
a
single
admirer
from
the
president
of
the
gun
club
the
latter
did
not
even
take
the
pains
to
refute
the
arguments
of
his
rival
nicholl
driven
into
his
last
entrenchments
and
not
able
to
fight
personally
in
the
cause
resolved
to
fight
with
money
he
published
therefore
in
the
richmond
a
series
of
wagers
conceived
in
these
terms
and
on
an
increasing
scale
no
that
the
necessary
funds
for
the
experiment
of
the
gun
club
will
not
be
forthcoming
no
that
the
operation
of
casting
a
cannon
of
feet
is
impracticable
and
can
not
possibly
succeed
no
that
is
it
impossible
to
load
the
columbiad
and
that
the
pyroxyle
will
take
fire
spontaneously
under
the
pressure
of
the
projectile
no
that
the
columbiad
will
burst
at
the
first
fire
no
that
the
shot
will
not
travel
farther
than
six
miles
and
that
it
will
fall
back
again
a
few
seconds
after
its
discharge
it
was
an
important
sum
therefore
which
the
captain
risked
in
his
invincible
obstinacy
he
had
no
less
than
at
stake
notwithstanding
the
importance
of
the
challenge
on
the
of
may
he
received
a
sealed
packet
containing
the
following
superbly
laconic
reply
baltimore
october
done
barbicane
chapter
xi
florida
and
texas
one
question
remained
yet
to
be
decided
it
was
necessary
to
choose
a
favorable
spot
for
the
experiment
according
to
the
advice
of
the
observatory
of
cambridge
the
gun
must
be
fired
perpendicularly
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
that
is
to
say
toward
the
zenith
now
the
moon
does
not
traverse
the
zenith
except
in
places
situated
between
and
of
latitude
it
became
then
necessary
to
determine
exactly
that
spot
on
the
globe
where
the
immense
columbiad
should
be
cast
on
the
of
october
at
a
general
meeting
of
the
gun
club
barbicane
produced
a
magnificent
map
of
the
united
states
gentlemen
said
he
in
opening
the
discussion
i
presume
that
we
are
all
agreed
that
this
experiment
can
not
and
ought
not
to
be
tried
anywhere
but
within
the
limits
of
the
soil
of
the
union
now
by
good
fortune
certain
frontiers
of
the
united
states
extend
downward
as
far
as
the
parallel
of
the
north
latitude
if
you
will
cast
your
eye
over
this
map
you
will
see
that
we
have
at
our
disposal
the
whole
of
the
southern
portion
of
texas
and
florida
it
was
finally
agreed
then
that
the
columbiad
must
be
cast
on
the
soil
of
either
texas
or
florida
the
result
however
of
this
decision
was
to
create
a
rivalry
entirely
without
precedent
between
the
different
towns
of
these
two
states
the
parallel
on
reaching
the
american
coast
traverses
the
peninsula
of
florida
dividing
it
into
two
nearly
equal
portions
then
plunging
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
subtends
the
arc
formed
by
the
coast
of
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
then
skirting
texas
off
which
it
cuts
an
angle
it
continues
its
course
over
mexico
crosses
the
sonora
old
california
and
loses
itself
in
the
pacific
ocean
it
was
therefore
only
those
portions
of
texas
and
florida
which
were
situated
below
this
parallel
which
came
within
the
prescribed
conditions
of
latitude
florida
in
its
southern
part
reckons
no
cities
of
importance
it
is
simply
studded
with
forts
raised
against
the
roving
indians
one
solitary
town
tampa

was
able
to
put
in

in

the
contrary

against

pretensions

so
scarcely
was
the
decision
known
when
the
texan
and
floridan
deputies
arrived
at
baltimore
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
from
that
very
moment
president
barbicane
and
the
influential
members
of
the
gun
club
were
besieged
day
and
night
by
formidable
claims
if
seven
cities
of
greece
contended
for
the
honor
of
having
given
birth
to
a
homer
here
were
two
entire
states
threatening
to
come
to
blows
about
the
question
of
a
cannon
the
rival
parties
promenaded
the
streets
with
arms
in
their
hands
and
at
every
occasion
of
their
meeting
a
collision
was
to
be
apprehended
which
might
have
been
attended
with
disastrous
results
happily
the
prudence
and
address
of
president
barbicane
averted
the
danger
these
personal
demonstrations
found
a
division
in
the
newspapers
of
the
different
states
the
new
york
and
the
supported
texas
while
the
and
the
espoused
the
cause
of
the
floridan
deputies
the
members
of
the
gun
club
could
not
decide
to
which
to
give
the
preference
texas
produced
its
array
of
counties
florida
replied
that
twelve
counties
were
better
than
in
a
country
only
part
of
the
size
texas
plumed
itself
upon
its
natives
florida
with
a
far
smaller
territory
boasted
of
being
much
more
densely
populated
with
the
texans
through
the
columns
of
the
claimed
that
some
regard
should
be
had
to
a
state
which
grew
the
best
cotton
in
all
america
produced
the
best
green
oak
for
the
service
of
the
navy
and
contained
the
finest
oil
besides
iron
mines
in
which
the
yield
was
fifty
per
cent
of
pure
metal
to
this
the
replied
that
the
soil
of
florida
although
not
equally
rich
afforded
the
best
conditions
for
the
moulding
and
casting
of
the
columbiad
consisting
as
it
did
of
sand
and
argillaceous
earth
that
may
be
all
very
well
replied
the
texans
but
you
must
first
get
to
this
country
now
the
communications
with
florida
are
difficult
while
the
coast
of
texas
offers
the
bay
of
galveston
which
possesses
a
circumference
of
fourteen
leagues
and
is
capable
of
containing
the
navies
of
the
entire
world
a
pretty
notion
truly
replied
the
papers
in
the
interest
of
florida
that
of
galveston
bay
the
parallel
have
we
not
got
the
bay
of
espiritu
santo
opening
precisely
upon
and
by
which
ships
can
reach
tampa
town
by
direct
route
a
fine
bay
half
choked
with
sand
choked
yourselves
returned
the
others
thus
the
war
went
on
for
several
days
when
florida
endeavored
to
draw
her
adversary
away
on
to
fresh
ground
and
one
morning
the
hinted
that
the
enterprise
being
essentially
american
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted
upon
other
than
purely
american
territory
to
these
words
texas
retorted
american
are
we
not
as
much
so
as
you
were
not
texas
and
florida
both
incorporated
into
the
union
in
undoubtedly
replied
the
but
we
have
belonged
to
the
americans
ever
since
yes
returned
the

having
been
spaniards

for
two
hundred

you

why
need

in
at
the
price
of
sixteen
million
dollars
scandalous
roared
the
texas
deputies
a
wretched
little
strip
of
country
like
florida
to
dare
to
compare
itself
to
texas
who
in
place
of
selling
herself
asserted
her
own
independence
drove
out
the
mexicans
in
march
and
declared
herself
a
federal
republic
after
the
victory
gained
by
samuel
houston
on
the
banks
of
the
san
jacinto
over
the
troops
of
santa
anna
a
country
in
fine
which
voluntarily
annexed
itself
to
the
united
states
of
america
yes
because
it
was
afraid
of
the
mexicans
replied
florida
afraid
from
this
moment
the
state
of
things
became
intolerable
a
sanguinary
encounter
seemed
daily
imminent
between
the
two
parties
in
the
streets
of
baltimore
it
became
necessary
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
deputies
president
barbicane
knew
not
which
way
to
look
notes
documents
letters
full
of
menaces
showered
down
upon
his
house
which
side
ought
he
to
take
as
regarded
the
appropriation
of
the
soil
the
facility
of
communication
the
rapidity
of
transport
the
claims
of
both
states
were
evenly
balanced
as
for
political
prepossessions
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
this
dead
block
had
existed
for
some
little
time
when
barbicane
resolved
to
get
rid
of
it
all
at
once
he
called
a
meeting
of
his
colleagues
and
laid
before
them
a
proposition
which
it
will
be
seen
was
profoundly
sagacious
on
carefully
considering
he
said
what
is
going
on
now
between
florida
and
texas
it
is
clear
that
the
same
difficulties
will
recur
with
all
the
towns
of
the
favored
state
the
rivalry
will
descend
from
state
to
city
and
so
on
downward
now
texas
possesses
eleven
towns
within
the
prescribed
conditions
which
will
further
dispute
the
honor
and
create
us
new
enemies
while
florida
has
only
one
i
go
in
therefore
for
florida
and
tampa
town
this
decision
on
being
made
known
utterly
crushed
the
texan
deputies
seized
with
an
indescribable
fury
they
addressed
threatening
letters
to
the
different
members
of
the
gun
club
by
name
the
magistrates
had
but
one
course
to
take
and
they
took
it
they
chartered
a
special
train
forced
the
texans
into
it
whether
they
would
or
no
and
they
quitted
the
city
with
a
speed
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
quickly
however
as
they
were
despatched
they
found
time
to
hurl
one
last
and
bitter
sarcasm
at
their
adversaries
alluding
to
the
extent
of
florida
a
mere
peninsula
confined
between
two
seas
they
pretended
that
it
could
never
sustain
the
shock
of
the
discharge
and
that
it
would
bust
up
at
the
very
first
shot
very
well
let
it
bust
up
replied
the
floridans
with
a
brevity
of
the
days
of
ancient
sparta
chapter
xii
urbi
et
orbi
the
astronomical
mechanical
and
topographical
difficulties
resolved
finally
came
the
question
of
finance
the
sum
required
was
far
too
great
for
any
individual
or
even
any
single
state
to
provide
the
requisite
millions
president
barbicane
undertook
despite
of
the
matter
being
a
purely
american
affair
to
render
it
one
of
universal
interest
and
to
request
the
financial
of
all
peoples
it
was
he
maintained
the
right
and
duty
of
the
whole
earth
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
its
satellite
the
subscription
opened
at
baltimore
extended
properly
to
the
whole
world
et
this
subscription
was
successful
beyond
all
expectation
notwithstanding
that
it
was
a
question
not
of
lending
but
of
giving
the
money
it
was
a
purely
disinterested
operation
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term
and
offered
not
the
slightest
chance
of
profit
the
effect
however
of
barbicane
communication
was
not
confined
to
the
frontiers
of
the
united
states
it
crossed
the
atlantic
and
pacific
invading
simultaneously
asia
and
europe
africa
and
oceanica
the
observatories
of
the
union
placed
themselves
in
immediate
communication
with
those
of
foreign
countries
some
such
as
those
of
paris
petersburg
berlin
stockholm
hamburg
malta
lisbon
benares
madras
and
others
transmitted
their
good
wishes
the
rest
maintained
a
prudent
silence
quietly
awaiting
the
result
as
for
the
observatory
at
greenwich
seconded
as
it
was
by
the
two
astronomical
establishments
of
great
britain
it
spoke
plainly
enough
it
boldly
denied
the
possibility
of
success
and
pronounced
in
favor
of
the
theories
of
captain
nicholl
but
this
was
nothing
more
than
mere
english
jealousy
on
the
of
october
president
barbicane
published
a
manifesto
full
of
enthusiasm
in
which
he
made
an
appeal
to
all
persons
of
good
will
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
this
document
translated
into
all
languages
met
with
immense
success
subscription

were
opened
in
all
the
principal

of
the

with

with
such
a
balance
the
gun
club
might
begin
operations
at
once
but
some
days
later
advices
were
received
to
the
effect
that
foreign
subscriptions
were
being
eagerly
taken
up
certain
countries
distinguished
themselves
by
their
liberality
others
untied
their
with
less
facility
a
matter
of
temperament

are
however
more
eloquent
than
words
and
here
is
the
official
statement
of
the
sums
which
were
paid
in
to
the
credit
of
the
gun
club
at
the
close
of
the
subscription
russia
paid
in
as
her
contingent
the
enormous
sum
of
roubles
no
one
need
be
surprised
at
this
who
bears
in
mind
the
scientific
taste
of
the
russians
and
the
impetus
which
they
have
given
to
astronomical
studies
thanks
to
their
numerous
observatories
france
began
by
deriding
the
pretensions
of
the
americans
the
moon
served
as
a
pretext
for
a
thousand
stale
puns
and
a
score
of
ballads
in
which
bad
taste
contested
the
palm
with
ignorance
but
as
formerly
the
french
paid
before
singing
so
now
they
paid
after
having
had
their
laugh
and
they
subscribed
for
a
sum
of
francs
at
that
price
they
had
a
right
to
enjoy
themselves
a
little
austria
showed
herself
generous
in
the
midst
of
her
financial
crisis
her
public
contributions
amounted
to
the
sum
of
florins
a
perfect
godsend
thousand
were
the
remittance
of
sweden
and
norway
the
amount
is
large
for
the
country
but
it
would
undoubtedly
have
been
considerably
increased
had
the
subscription
been
opened
in
christiana
simultaneously
with
that
at
stockholm
for
some
reason
or
other
the
norwegians
do
not
like
to
send
their
money
to
sweden
prussia
by
a
remittance
of
thalers
testified
her
high
approval
of
the
enterprise
turkey
behaved
generously
but
she
had
a
personal
interest
in
the
matter
the
moon
in
fact
regulates
the
cycle
of
her
years
and
her
fast
of
ramadan
she
could
not
do
less
than
give
piastres
and
she
gave
them
with
an
eagerness
which
denoted
however
some
pressure
on
the
part
of
the
government
belgium
distinguished
herself
among
the
states
by
a
grant
of
francs
about
two
centimes
per
head
of
her
population
holland
and
her
colonies
interested
themselves
to
the
extent
of
florins
only
demanding
an
allowance
of
five
per
cent
discount
for
paying
ready
money
denmark
a
little
contracted
in
territory
gave
nevertheless
ducats
proving
her
love
for
scientific
experiments
the
germanic
confederation
pledged
itself
to
florins
it
was
impossible
to
ask
for
more
besides
they
would
not
have
given
it
though
very
much
crippled
italy
found
lire
in
the
pockets
of
her
people
if
she
had
had
venetia
she
would
have
done
better
but
she
had
not
the
states
of
the
church
thought
that
they
could
not
send
less
than
roman
crowns
and
portugal
carried
her
devotion
to
science
as
far
as
cruzados
it
was
the
widow
mite
piastres
but
empires
are
always
rather
short
of
money
two
hundred
and
francs
this
was
the
modest
contribution
of
switzerland
to
the
american
work
one
must
freely
admit
that
she
did
not
see
the
practical
side
of
the
matter
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
the
mere
despatch
of
a
shot
to
the
moon
could
possibly
establish
any
relation
of
affairs
with
her
and
it
did
not
seem
prudent
to
her
to
embark
her
capital
in
so
hazardous
an
enterprise
after
all
perhaps
she
was
right
as
to
spain
she
could
not
scrape
together
more
than
reals
she
gave
as
an
excuse
that
she
had
her
railways
to
finish
the
truth
is
that
science
is
not
favorably
regarded
in
that
country
it
is
still
in
a
backward
state
and
moreover
certain
spaniards
not
by
any
means
the
least
educated
did
not
form
a
correct
estimate
of
the
bulk
of
the
projectile
compared
with
that
of
the
moon
they
feared
that
it
would
disturb
the
established
order
of
things
in
that
case
it
were
better
to
keep
aloof
which
they
did
to
the
tune
of
some
reals
there
remained
but
england
and
we
know
the
contemptuous
antipathy
with
which
she
received
barbicane
proposition
the
english
have
but
one
soul
for
the
whole
millions
of
inhabitants
which
great
britain
contains
they
hinted
that
the
enterprise
of
the
gun
club
was
contrary
to
the
principle
of
and
they
did
not
subscribe
a
single
farthing
at
this
intimation
the
gun
club
merely
shrugged
its
shoulders
and
returned
to
its
great
work
when
south
america
that
is
to
say
peru
chili
brazil
the
provinces
of
la
plata
and
columbia
had
poured
forth
their
quota
into
their
hands
the
sum
of
it
found
itself
in
possession
of
a
considerable
capital
of
which
the
following
is
a
statement

subscriptions
total
such
was
the
sum
which
the
public
poured
into
the
treasury
of
the
gun
club
let
no
one
be
surprised
at
the
vastness
of
the
amount
the
work
of
casting
boring
masonry
the
transport
of
workmen
their
establishment
in
an
almost
uninhabited
country
the
construction
of
furnaces

the

incipient
expenses
would
according
to
the
estimates
absorb
nearly
the
whole

the
federal
war
cost
one
thousand
dollars
apiece
this
one
of
president
barbicane
unique
in
the
annals
of
gunnery
might
well
cost
five
thousand
times
more
on
the
of
october
a
contract
was
entered
into
with
the
manufactory
at
coldspring
near
new
york
which
during
the
war
had
furnished
the
largest
parrott
guns
it
was
stipulated
between
the
contracting
parties
that
the
manufactory
of
coldspring
should
engage
to
transport
to
tampa
town
in
southern
florida
the
necessary
materials
for
casting
the
columbiad
the
work
was
bound
to
be
completed
at
latest
by
the
of
october
following
and
the
cannon
delivered
in
good
condition
under
penalty
of
a
forfeit
of
one
hundred
dollars
a
day
to
the
moment
when
the
moon
should
again
present
herself
under
the
same
conditions
that
is
to

in
eighteen
years
and
eleven
days
the
engagement
of
the
workmen
their
pay
and
all
the
necessary
details
of
the
work
devolved
upon
the
coldspring
company
this
contract
executed
in

was
signed
by

of

of
the

part
and

was
arrived
at
by

the
disparagement
of

where
reading
is
a
universal
acquirement
set
to

to

the

never
before
had
there

on
the

florida
it
became
necessary
to
issue
fresh
editions
of
these
works
barbicane
had
something
better
to
do
than
to
read
he
desired
to
see
things
with
his
own
eyes
and
to
mark
the
exact
position
of
the
proposed
gun
so
without
a
moment
loss
of
time
he
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
cambridge
observatory
the
funds
necessary
for
the
construction
of
a
telescope
and
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
house
of
breadwill
and
of
albany
for
the
construction
of
an
aluminum
projectile
of
the
required
size
he
then
quitted
baltimore
accompanied
by
maston
major
elphinstone
and
the
manager
of
the
coldspring
factory
on
the
following
day
the
four
arrived
at
new
orleans
there
they
immediately
embarked
on
board
the
a
belonging
to
the
federal
navy
which
the
government
had
placed
at
their
disposal
and
getting
up
steam
the
banks
of
louisiana
speedily
disappeared
from
sight
the
passage
was
not
long
two
days
after
starting
the
having
made
four
hundred
and
eighty
miles
came
in
sight
of
the
coast
of
florida
on
a
nearer
approach
barbicane
found
himself
in
view
of
a
low
flat
country
of
somewhat
barren
aspect
after
coasting
along
a
series
of
creeks
abounding
in
lobsters
and
oysters
the
entered
the
bay
of
espiritu
santo
where
she
finally
anchored
in
a
small
natural
harbor
formed
by
the
of
the
river
hillisborough
at
seven
on
the
of
october
our
four
passengers
disembarked
at
once
gentlemen
said
barbicane
we
have
no
time
to
lose
tomorrow
we
must
obtain
horses
and
proceed
to
reconnoiter
the
country
barbicane
had
scarcely
set
his
foot
on
shore
when
three
thousand
of
the
inhabitants
of
tampa
town
came
forth
to
meet
him
an
honor
due
to
the
president
who
had
signalized
their
country
by
his
choice
declining
however
every
kind
of
ovation
barbicane
ensconced
himself
in
a
room
of
the
franklin
hotel
on
the
morrow
some
of
the
small
horses
of
the
spanish
breed
full
of
vigor
and
of
fire
stood
snorting
under
his
windows
but
instead
of
four
steeds
here
were
fifty
together
with
their
riders
barbicane
descended
with
his
three
travelers
and
much
astonished
were
they
all
to
find
themselves
in
the
midst
of
such
a
cavalcade
he
remarked
that
every
horseman
carried
a
carbine
slung
across
his
shoulders
and
pistols
in
his
holsters
on
expressing
his
surprise
at
these
preparations
he
was
speedily
enlightened
by
a
young
floridan
who
quietly
said
sir
there
are
seminoles
there
what
do
you
mean
by
seminoles
savages
who
scour
the
prairies
we
thought
it
best
therefore
to
escort
you
on
your
road
pooh
cried
maston
mounting
his
steed
all
right
said
the
floridan
but
it
is
true
enough
nevertheless
gentlemen
answered
barbicane
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention
but
it
is
time
to
be
off
it
was
five
when
barbicane
and
his
party
quitting
tampa
town
made
their
way
along
the
coast
in
the
direction
of
alifia
creek
this
little
river
falls
into
hillisborough
bay
twelve
miles
above
tampa
town
barbicane
and
his
escort
coasted
along
its
right
bank
to
the
eastward
soon
the
waves
of
the
bay
disappeared
behind
a
bend
of
rising
ground
and
the
floridan
champagne
alone
offered
itself
to
view
florida
discovered
on
palm
sunday
in
by
juan
ponce
de
leon
was
originally
named
it
little
deserved
that
designation
with
its
dry
and
parched
coasts
but
after
some
few
miles
of
tract
the
nature
of
the
soil
gradually
changes
and
the
country
shows
itself
worthy
of
the
name
cultivated
plains
soon
appear
where
are
united
all
the
productions
of
the
northern
and
tropical
floras
terminating
in
prairies
abounding
with
pineapples
and
yams
tobacco
rice
and
which
extend
beyond
reach
of
sight
flinging
their
riches
broadcast
with
careless
prodigality
barbicane
appeared
highly
pleased
on
observing
the
progressive
elevation
of
the
land
and
in
answer
to
a
question
of
maston
replied
my
worthy
friend
we
can
not
do

perhaps
said
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
not
exactly
replied
barbicane
smiling
do
you
not
see
that
among
these
elevated
plateaus
we
shall
have
a
much
easier
work
of
it
no
struggles
with
the
which
will
save
us
long
expensive
tubings
and
we
shall
be
working
in
daylight
instead
of
down
a
deep
and
narrow
well
our
business
then
is
to
open
our
trenches
upon
ground
some
hundreds
of
yards
above
the
level
of
the
sea
you
are
right
sir
struck
in
murchison
the
engineer
and
if
i
mistake
not
we
shall
ere
long
find
a
suitable
spot
for
our
purpose
i
wish
we
were
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
pickaxe
said
the
president
and
i
wish
we
were

crossed
a

miles
to

plains
succeeded
a
region
of
forests
there
perfumes
of
the
most
varied
kinds
mingled
together
in
tropical
profusion
these
almost
impenetrable
forests
were
composed
of
pomegranates
citrons
figs
olives
apricots
bananas
huge
vines
whose
blossoms
and
fruits
rivaled
each

in
color
and

beneath
the
odorous
shade
of
these
magnificent
trees
fluttered
and
warbled
a
little
world
of
brilliantly
plumaged
birds
maston
and
the
major
could
not
repress
their
admiration
on
finding
themselves
in
the
presence
of
the
glorious
beauties
of
this
wealth
of
nature
president
barbicane
however
less
sensitive
to
these
wonders
was
in
haste
to
press
forward
the
very
luxuriance
of
the
country
was
displeasing
to
him
they
hastened
onward
therefore
and
were
compelled
to
ford
several
rivers
not
without
danger
for
they
were
infested
with
huge
alligators
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
long
maston
courageously
menaced
them
with
his
steel
hook
but
he
only
succeeded
in
frightening
some
pelicans
and
teal
while
tall
flamingos
stared
stupidly
at
the
party
at
length
these
denizens
of
the
swamps
disappeared
in
their
turn
smaller
trees
became
thinly
scattered
among
less
dense
thickets
a
few
isolated
groups
detached
in
the
midst
of
endless
plains
over
which
ranged
herds
of
startled
deer
at
last
cried
barbicane
rising
in
his
stirrups
here
we
are
at
the
region
of
pines
yes
and
of
savages
too
replied
the
major
in
fact
some
seminoles
had
just
came
in
sight
upon
the
horizon
they
rode
violently
backward
and
forward
on
their
fleet
horses
brandishing
their
spears
or
discharging
their
guns
with
a
dull
report
these
hostile
demonstrations
however
had
no
effect
upon
barbicane
and
his
companions
they
were
then
occupying
the
center
of
a
rocky
plain
which
the
sun
scorched
with
its
parching
rays
this
was
formed
by
a
considerable
elevation
of
the
soil
which
seemed
to
offer
to
the
members
of
the
gun
club
all
the
conditions
requisite
for
the
construction
of
their

said
barbicane

replied
one
of
the
floridans
barbicane
without
saying
a
word
dismounted
seized
his
instruments
and
began
to
note
his
position
with
extreme
exactness
the
little
band
drawn
up
in
the
rear
watched
his
proceedings
in
profound
silence
at
this
moment
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
barbicane
after
a
few
moments
rapidly
wrote
down
the
result
of
his
observations
and
said
this
spot
is
situated
eighteen
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
in
lat
and
long
of
the
meridian
of
washington
it
appears
to
me
by
its
rocky
and
barren
character
to
offer
all
the
conditions
requisite
for
our
experiment
on
that
plain
will
be
raised
our

the

barbicane
and
his
companions
returned
to
tampa
town
and
murchison
the
engineer
on
board
the
tampico
for
new
orleans
his
object
was
to
enlist
an
army
of
workmen
and
to
collect
together
the
greater
part
of
the
materials
the
members
of
the
gun
club
remained
at
tampa
town
for
the
purpose
of
setting
on
foot
the
preliminary
works
by
the
aid
of
the
people
of
the
country
eight
days
after
its
departure
the
tampico
returned
into
the
bay
of
espiritu
santo
with
a
whole
flotilla
of
steamboats
murchison
had
succeeded
in
assembling
together
fifteen
hundred
artisans
attracted
by
the
high
pay
and
considerable
bounties
offered
by
the
gun
club
he
had
enlisted
a
choice
legion
of
stokers
miners
brickmakers
and
artisans
of
every
trade
without
distinction
of
color
as
many
of
these
people
brought
their
families
with
them
their
departure
resembled
a
perfect
emigration
on
the
of
october
at
ten
in
the
morning
the
troop
disembarked
on
the
quays
of
tampa
town
and
one
may
imagine
the
activity
which
pervaded
that
little
town
whose
population
was
thus
doubled
in
a
single
day
during
the
first
few
days
they
were
busy
discharging
the
cargo
brought
by
the
flotilla
the
machines
and
the
rations
as
well
as
a
large
number
of
huts
constructed
of
iron
plates

pieced
and
numbered

period
barbicane
laid
the
first
sleepers
of
a
railway
fifteen
miles
in
length
intended
to
unite
stones
hill
with
tampa
town
on
the
first
of
november
barbicane
quitted
tampa
town
with
a
detachment
of
workmen
and
on
the
following
day
the
whole
town
of
huts
was
erected
round
stones
hill
this
they
enclosed
with
palisades
and
in
respect
of
energy
and
activity
it
might
have
been
mistaken
for
one
of
the
great
cities
of
the
union
everything
was
placed
under
a
complete
system
of
discipline
and
the
works
were
commenced
in
most
perfect
order
the
nature
of
the
soil
having
been
carefully
examined
by
means
of
repeated
borings
the
work
of
excavation
was
fixed
for
the
of
november
on
that
day
barbicane
called
together
his
foremen
and
addressed
them
as
follows
you
are
well
aware
my
friends
of
the
object
with
which
i
have
assembled
you
together
in
this
wild
part
of
florida
our
business
is
to
construct
a
cannon
measuring
nine
feet
in
its
interior
diameter
six
feet
thick
and
with
a
stone
revetment
of
nineteen
and
a
half
feet
in
thickness
we
have
therefore
a
well
of
sixty
feet
in
diameter
to
dig
down
to
a
depth
of
nine
hundred
feet
this
great
work
must
be
completed
within
eight
months
so
that
you
have
cubic
feet
of
earth
to
excavate
in
days
that
is
to
say
in
round
numbers
cubic
feet
per
day
that
which
would
present
no
difficulty
to
a
thousand
navvies
working
in
open
country
will
be
of
course
more
troublesome
in
a
comparatively
confined
space
however
the
thing
must
be
done
and
i
reckon
for
its
accomplishment
upon
your
courage
as
much
as
upon
your
skill
at
eight
the
next
morning
the
first
stroke
of
the
pickaxe
was
struck
upon
the
soil
of
florida
and
from
that
moment
that
prince
of
tools
was
never
inactive
for
one
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
excavators
the
gangs
relieved
each
other
every
three
hours
on
the
of
november
fifty
workmen
commenced
digging
in
the
very
center
of
the
enclosed
space
on
the
summit
of
stones
hill
a
circular
hole
sixty
feet
in
diameter
the
pickaxe
first
struck
upon
a
kind
of
black
earth
six
inches
in
thickness
which
was
speedily
disposed
of
to
this
earth
succeeded
two
feet
of
fine
sand
which
was
carefully
laid
aside
as
being
valuable
for
serving
the
casting
of
the
inner
mould
after
the
sand
appeared
some
compact
white
clay
resembling
the
chalk
of
great
britain
which
extended
down
to
a
depth
of
four
feet
then
the
iron
of
the
picks
struck
upon
the
hard
bed
of
the
soil
a
kind
of
rock
formed
of
petrified
shells
very
dry
very
solid
and
which
the
picks
could
with
difficulty
penetrate
at
this
point
the
excavation
exhibited
a
depth
of
six
and
a
half
feet
and
the
work
of
the
masonry
was
begun
at
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
they
constructed
a
wheel
of
oak
a
kind
of
circle
strongly
bolted
together
and
of
immense
strength
the
center
of
this
wooden
disc
was
hollowed
out
to
a
diameter
equal
to
the
exterior
diameter
of
the
columbiad
upon
this
wheel
rested
the
first
layers
of
the
masonry
the
stones
of
which
were
bound
together
by
hydraulic
cement
with
irresistible
tenacity
the
workmen
after
laying
the
stones
from
the
circumference
to
the
center
were
thus
enclosed
within
a
kind
of
well
feet
in
diameter
when
this
work
was
accomplished
the
miners
resumed
their
picks
and
cut
away
the
rock
from
underneath
the
wheel
itself
taking
care
to
support
it
as
they
advanced
upon
blocks
of
great
thickness
at
every
two
feet
which
the
hole
gained
in
depth
they
successively
withdrew
the
blocks
the
wheel
then
sank
little
by
little
and
with
it
the
massive
ring
of
masonry
on
the
upper
bed
of
which
the
masons
labored
incessantly
always
reserving
some
vent
holes
to
permit
the
escape
of
gas
during
the
operation
of
the
casting
this
kind
of
work
required
on
the
part
of
the
workmen
extreme
nicety
and
minute
attention
more
than
one
in
digging
underneath
the
wheel
was
dangerously
injured
by
the
splinters
of
stone
but
their
ardor
never
relaxed
night
or
day
by
day
they
worked
under
the
rays
of
the
scorching
sun
by
night
under
the
gleam
of
the
electric
light
the
sounds
of
the
picks
against
the
rock
the
bursting
of
mines
the
grinding
of
the
machines
the
wreaths
of
smoke
scattered
through
the
air
traced
around
stones
hill
a
circle
of
terror
which
the
herds
of
buffaloes
and
the
war
parties
of
the
seminoles
never
ventured
to
pass
nevertheless
the
works
advanced
regularly
as
the
actively
removed
the
rubbish
of
unexpected
obstacles
there
was
little
account
and
with
regard
to
foreseen
difficulties
they
were
speedily
disposed
of
at
the
expiration
of
the
first
month
the
well
had
attained
the
depth
assigned
for
that
lapse
of
time
namely
feet
this
depth
was
doubled
in
december
and
trebled
in
january
during
the
month
of
february
the
workmen
had
to
contend
with
a
sheet
of
water
which
made
its
way
right
across
the
outer
soil
it
became
necessary
to
employ
very
powerful
pumps
and
engines
to
drain
it
off
so
as
to
close
up
the
orifice
from
whence
it
issued
just
as
one
stops
a
leak
on
board
ship
they
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
the
upper
hand
of
these
untoward
streams
only
in
consequence
of
the
loosening
of
the
soil
the
wheel
partly
gave
way
and
a
slight
partial
settlement
ensued
this
accident
cost
the
life
of
several
workmen
no
fresh
occurrence
thenceforward
arrested
the
progress
of
the
operation
and
on
the
tenth
of
june
twenty
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
period
fixed
by
barbicane
the
well
lined
throughout
with
its
facing
of
stone
had
attained
the
depth
of
feet
at
the
bottom
the
masonry
rested
upon
a
massive
block
measuring
thirty
feet
in
thickness
while
on
the
upper
portion
it
was
level
with
the
surrounding
soil
president
barbicane
and
the
members
of
the
gun
club
warmly
congratulated
their
engineer
murchison
the
cyclopean
work
had
been
accomplished
with
extraordinary
rapidity
during
these
eight
months
barbicane
never
quitted
stones
hill
for
a
single
instant
keeping
ever
close
by
the
work
of
excavation
he
busied
himself
incessantly
with
the
welfare
and
health
of
his
workpeople
and
was
singularly
fortunate
in
warding
off
the
epidemics
common
to
large
communities
of
men
and
so
disastrous
in
those
regions
of
the
globe
which
are
exposed
to
the
influences
of
tropical
climates
many
workmen
it
is
true
paid
with
their
lives
for
the
rashness
inherent
in
these
dangerous
labors
but
these
mishaps
are
impossible
to
be
avoided
and
they
are
classed
among
the
details
with
which
the
americans
trouble
themselves
but
little
they
have
in
fact
more
regard
for
human
nature
in
general
than
for
the
individual
in
particular
nevertheless
barbicane
professed
opposite
principles
to
these
and
put
them
in
force
at
every
opportunity
so
thanks
to
his
care
his
intelligence
his
useful
intervention
in
all
difficulties
his
prodigious
and
humane
sagacity
the
average
of
accidents
did
not
exceed
that
of
transatlantic
countries
noted
for
their
excessive
precautions
france
for
instance
among
others
where

about
one

the
fete
of
the
casting
during
the
eight
months
which
were
employed
in
the
work
of
excavation
the
preparatory
works
of
the
casting
had
been
carried
on
simultaneously
with
extreme
rapidity
a
stranger
arriving
at
stones
hill
would
have
been
surprised
at
the
spectacle
offered
to
his
view
at
yards
from
the
well
and
circularly
arranged
around
it
as
a
central
point
rose
reverberating
ovens
each
six
feet
in
diameter
and
separated
from
each
other
by
an
interval
of
three
feet
the
circumference
occupied
by
these
ovens
presented
a
length
of
two
miles
being
all
constructed
on
the
same
plan
each
with
its
high
quadrangular
chimney
they
produced
a
most
singular
effect
it
will
be
remembered
that
on
their
third
meeting
the
committee
had
decided
to
use
cast
iron
for
the
columbiad
and
in
particular
the
white
description
this
metal
in
fact
is
the
most
tenacious
the
most
ductile
and
the
most
malleable
and
consequently
suitable
for
all
moulding
operations
and
when
smelted
with
pit
coal
is
of
superior
quality
for
all
engineering
works
requiring
great
resisting
power
such
as
cannon
steam
boilers
hydraulic
presses
and
the
like
cast
iron
however
if
subjected
to
only
one
single
fusion
is
rarely
sufficiently
homogeneous
and
it
requires
a
second
fusion
completely
to
refine
it
by
dispossessing
it
of
its
last
earthly
deposits
so
long
before
being
forwarded
to
tampa
town
the
iron
ore
molten
in
the
great
furnaces
of
coldspring
and
brought
into
contact
with
coal
and
silicium
heated
to
a
high
temperature
was
carburized
and
transformed
into
cast
iron
after
this
first
operation
the
metal
was
sent
on
to
stones
hill
they
had
however
to
deal
with
pounds
of
iron
a
quantity
far
too
costly
to
send
by
railway
the
cost
of
transport
would
have
been
double
that
of
material
it
appeared
preferable
to
freight
vessels
at
new
york
and
to
load
them
with
the
iron
in
bars
this
however
required
not
less
than
eight
vessels
of
tons
a
veritable
fleet
which
quitting
new
york
on
the
of
may
on
the
of
the
same
month
ascended
the
bay
of
espiritu
santo
and
discharged
their
cargoes
without
dues
in
the
port
at
tampa
town
thence
the
iron
was
transported
by
rail
to
stones
hill
and
about
the
middle
of
january
this
enormous
mass
of
metal
was
delivered
at
its
destination
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
furnaces
were
not
too
many
to
melt
simultaneously
these
tons
of
iron
each
of
these
furnaces
contained
nearly
pounds
weight
of
metal
they
were
all
built
after
the
model
of
those
which
served
for
the
casting
of
the
rodman
gun
they
were
trapezoidal
in
shape
with
a
high
elliptical
arch
these
furnaces
constructed
of
fireproof
brick
were
especially
adapted
for
burning
pit
coal
with
a
flat
bottom
upon
which
the
iron
bars
were
laid
this
bottom
inclined
at
an
angle
of
degrees
allowed
the
metal
to
flow
into
the
receiving
troughs
and
the
converging
trenches
carried
the
molten
metal
down
to
the
central
well
the
day
following
that
on
which
the
works
of
the
masonry
and
boring
had
been
completed
barbicane
set
to
work
upon
the
central
mould
his
object
now
was
to
raise
within
the
center
of
the
well
and
with
a
coincident
axis
a
cylinder
feet
high
and
nine
feet
in
diameter
which
should
exactly
fill
up
the
space
reserved
for
the
bore
of
the
columbiad
this
cylinder
was
composed
of
a
mixture
of
clay
and
sand
with
the
addition
of
a
little
hay
and
straw
the
space
left
between
the
mould
and
the
masonry
was
intended
to
be
filled
up
by
the
molten
metal
which
would
thus
form
the
walls
six
feet
in
thickness
this
cylinder
in
order
to
maintain
its
equilibrium
had
to
be
bound
by
iron
bands
and
firmly
fixed
at
certain
intervals
by
fastened
into
the
stone
lining
after
the
castings
these
would
be
buried
in
the
block
of
metal
leaving
no
external
projection
this
operation
was
completed
on
the
of
july
and
the
run
of
the
metal
was
fixed
for
the
following
day
this
of
the
casting
will
be
a
grand
ceremony
said
maston
to
his
friend
barbicane
undoubtedly
said
barbicane
but
it
will
not
be
a
public
what
will
you
not
open
the
gates
of
the
enclosure
to
all
comers
i
must
be
very
careful
maston
the
casting
of
the
columbiad
is
an
extremely
delicate
not
to
say
a
dangerous
operation
and
i
should
prefer
its
being
done
privately
at
the
discharge
of
the
projectile
a
if
you
like
till
then
no
the
president
was
right
the
operation
involved
unforeseen
dangers
which
a
great
influx
of
spectators
would
have
hindered
him
from
averting
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
complete
freedom
of
movement
no
one
was
admitted
within
the
enclosure
except
a
delegation
of
members
of
the
gun
club
who
had
made
the
voyage
to
tampa
town
among
these
was
the
brisk
bilsby
tom

colonel
blomsberry
major
elphinstone
general
morgan
and
the
rest
of
the
lot
to
whom
the
casting
of
the
columbiad
was
a
matter
of
personal
interest
maston
became
their
cicerone
he
omitted
no
point
of
detail
he
conducted
them
throughout
the
magazines
workshops
through
the
midst
of
the
engines
and
compelled
them
to
visit
the
whole
furnaces
one
after
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
visit
they
were
pretty
well
knocked
up
the
casting
was
to
take
place
at
twelve
precisely
the
previous
evening
each
furnace
had
been
charged
with
pounds
weight
of
metal
in
bars
disposed
to
each
other
so
as
to
allow
the
hot
air
to
circulate
freely
between
them
at
daybreak
the
chimneys
vomited
their
torrents
of
flame
into
the
air
and
the
ground
was
agitated
with
dull
tremblings
as
many
pounds
of
metal
as
there
were
to
cast
so
many
pounds
of
coal
were
there
to
burn
thus
there
were
tons
of
coal
which
projected
in
the
face
of
the
sun
a
thick
curtain
of
smoke
the
heat
soon
became
insupportable
within
the
circle
of
furnaces
the
rumbling
of
which
resembled
the
rolling
of
thunder
the
powerful
ventilators
added
their
continuous
blasts
and
saturated
with
oxygen
the
glowing
plates
the
operation
to
be
successful
required
to
be
conducted
with
great
rapidity
on
a
signal
given
by
a
each
furnace
was
to
give
vent
to
the
molten
iron
and
completely
to
empty
itself
these
arrangements
made
foremen
and
workmen
waited
the
preconcerted
moment
with
an
impatience
mingled
with
a
certain
amount
of
emotion
not
a
soul
remained
within
the
enclosure
each
superintendent
took
his
post
by
the
aperture
of
the

perched
on

to

some
minutes
before

the
first

of

began
to
flow

filled

and
by
the
time
that
the
whole
melting
was
completely
accomplished
it
was
kept
in
abeyance
for
a

in

to
facilitate
the

twelve

simultaneously

twelve

fiery
serpents
crept
toward
the
central

unrolling
their
incandescent
curves
there
down
they
plunged
with
a
terrific
noise
into
a
depth
of
feet
it
was
an
exciting
and
a
magnificent
spectacle
the
ground
trembled
while
these
molten
waves
launching
into
the
sky
their
wreaths
of
smoke
evaporated
the
moisture
of
the

and
hurled
it

limits

might
have
believed
that
some
new

forming

there
was
neither

any

who
had
produced
these
reddish
vapors
these
gigantic
flames
worthy
of
a
volcano
itself
these
tremendous
vibrations
resembling
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
these
reverberations
rivaling
those
of
hurricanes
and
storms

it
was
his

precipitated

the
columbiad
had
the
casting
succeeded
they
were
reduced
to
mere
conjecture
there
was
indeed
every
reason
to
expect
success
since
the
mould
has
absorbed
the
entire
mass
of
the
molten
metal
still
some
considerable
time
must
elapse
before
they
could
arrive
at
any
certainty
upon
the
matter
the
patience
of
the
members
of
the
gun
club
was
sorely
tried
during
this
period
of
time
but
they
could
do
nothing
maston
escaped
roasting
by
a
miracle
fifteen
days
after
the
casting
an
immense
column
of
smoke
was
still
rising
in
the
open
sky
and
the
ground
burned
the
soles
of
the
feet
within
a
radius
of
two
hundred
feet
round
the
summit
of
stones
hill
it
was
impossible
to
approach
nearer
all
they
could
do
was
to
wait
with
what
patience
they
might
here
we
are
at
the
of
august
exclaimed
maston
one
morning
only
four
months
to
the
of
december
we
shall
never
be
ready
in
time
barbicane
said
nothing
but
his
silence
covered
serious
irritation
however
daily
observations
revealed
a
certain
change
going
on
in
the
state
of
the
ground
about
the
of
august
the
vapors
ejected
had
sensibly
diminished
in
intensity
and
thickness
some
days
afterward
the
earth
exhaled
only
a
slight
puff
of
smoke
the
last
breath
of
the
monster
enclosed
within
its
circle
of
stone
little
by
little
the
belt
of
heat
contracted
until
on
the
of
august
barbicane
his
colleagues
and
the
engineer
were
enabled
to
set
foot
on
the
iron
sheet
which
lay
level
upon
the
summit
of
stones
hill
at
last
exclaimed
the
president
of
the
gun
club
with
an
immense
sigh
of
relief
the
work
was
resumed
the
same
day
they
proceeded
at
once
to
extract
the
interior
mould
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
out
the
boring
of
the
piece
pickaxes
and
boring
irons
were
set
to
work
without
intermission
the
clayey
and
sandy
soils
had
acquired
extreme
hardness
under
the
action
of
the
heat
but
by
the
aid
of
the
machines
the
rubbish
on
being
dug
out
was
rapidly
carted
away
on
railway
wagons
and
such
was
the
ardor
of
the
work
so
persuasive
the
arguments
of
barbicane
dollars
that
by
the
of
september
all
traces
of
the
mould
had
entirely
disappeared
immediately
the
operation
of
boring
was
commenced
and
by
the
aid
of
powerful
machines
a
few
weeks
later
the
inner
surface
of
the
immense
tube
had
been
rendered
perfectly
cylindrical
and
the
bore
of
the
piece
had
acquired
a
thorough
polish
at
length
on
the
of
september
less
than
a
twelvemonth
after
barbicane
original
proposition
the
enormous
weapon
accurately
bored
and
exactly
vertically
pointed
was
ready
for
work
there
was
only
the
moon
now
to
wait
for
and
they
were
pretty
sure
that
she
would
not
fail
in
the
rendezvous
the
ecstasy
of
maston
knew
no
bounds
and
he
narrowly
escaped
a
frightful
fall
while
staring
down
the
tube
but
for
the
strong
hand
of
colonel
blomsberry
the
worthy
secretary
like
a
modern
erostratus
would
have
found
his
death
in
the
depths
of
the
columbiad
the
cannon
was
then
finished
there
was
no
possible
doubt
as
to
its
perfect
completion
so
on
the
of
october
captain
nicholl
opened
an
account
between
himself
and
president
barbicane
in
which
he
debited
himself
to
the
latter
in
the
sum
of
two
thousand
dollars
one
may
believe
that
the
captain
wrath
was
increased
to
its
highest
point
and
must
have
made
him
seriously
ill
however
he
had
still
three
bets
of
three
four
and
five
thousand
dollars
respectively
and
if
he
gained
two
out
of
these
his
position
would
not
be
very
bad
but
the
money
question
did
not
enter
into
his
calculations
it
was
the
success
of
his
rival
in
casting
a
cannon
against
which
iron
plates
sixty
feet
thick
would
have
been
ineffectual
that
dealt
him
a
terrible
blow
after
the
of
september
the
enclosure
of
stones
hill
was
thrown
open
to
the
public
and
it
will
be
easily
imagined
what
was
the
concourse
of
visitors
to
this
spot
there
was
an
incessant
flow
of
people
to
and
from
tampa
town
and
the
place
which
resembled
a
procession
or
rather
in
fact
a
pilgrimage
it
was
already
clear
to
be
seen
that
on
the
day
of
the
experiment
itself
the
aggregate
of
spectators
would
be
counted
by
millions
for
they
were
already
arriving
from
all
parts
of
the
earth
upon
this
narrow
strip
of
promontory
europe
was
emigrating
to
america
up
to
that
time
however
it
must
be
confessed
the
curiosity
of
the
numerous
comers
was
but
scantily
gratified
most
had
counted
upon
witnessing
the
spectacle
of
the
casting
and
they
were
treated
to
nothing
but
smoke
this
was
sorry
food
for
hungry
eyes
but
barbicane
would
admit
no
one
to
that
operation
then
ensued
grumbling
discontent
murmurs
they
blamed
the
president
taxed
him
with
dictatorial
conduct
his
proceedings
were
declared
there
was
very
nearly
a
riot
round
stones
hill
but
barbicane
remained
inflexible
when
however
the
columbiad
was
entirely
finished
this
state
of
closed
doors
could
no
longer
be
maintained
besides
it
would
have
been
bad
taste
and
even
imprudence
to
affront
the
public
feeling
barbicane
therefore
opened
the
enclosure
to
all
comers
but
true
to
his
practical
disposition
he
determined
to
coin
money
out
of
the
public
curiosity
it
was
something
indeed
to
be
enabled
to
contemplate
this
immense
columbiad
but
to
descend
into
its
depths
this
seemed
to
the
americans
the
plus
of
earthly
felicity
consequently
there
was
not
one
curious
spectator
who
was
not
willing
to
give
himself
the
treat
of
visiting
the
interior
of
this
great
metallic
abyss
baskets
suspended
from
permitted
them
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
there
was
a
perfect
mania
women
children
old
men
all
made
it
a
point
of
duty
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
colossal
gun
the
fare
for
the
descent
was
fixed
at
five
dollars
per
head
and
despite
this
high
charge
during
the
two
months
which
preceded
the
experiment
the
influx
of
visitors
enabled
the
gun
club
to
pocket
nearly
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
first
visitors
of
the
columbiad
were
the
members
of
the
gun
club
this
privilege
was
justly
reserved
for
that
illustrious
body

ceremony

place

the

were
half

what
ecstasy
a
table
had
been
laid
with
six
covers
on
the
massive
stone
which
formed
the
bottom
of
the
columbiad
and
lighted
by
a
jet
of
electric
light

numerous
exquisite

a

dispatch
the
great
works
undertaken
by
the
gun

had
now
virtually
come
to
an
end
and
two
months
still
remained
before
the
day
for
the
discharge
of
the
shot
to
the
moon
to
the
general
impatience
these
two
months
appeared
as
long
as
years
hitherto
the
smallest
details
of
the
operation
had
been
daily
chronicled
by
the
journals
which
the
public
devoured
with
eager
eyes
just
at
this
moment
a
circumstance
the
most
unexpected
the
most
extraordinary
and
incredible
occurred
to
rouse
afresh
their
panting
spirits
and
to
throw
every
mind
into
a
state
of
the
most
violent
excitement
one
day
the
of
september
at
a
telegram
transmitted
by
cable
from
valentia
ireland
to
newfoundland
and
the
american
mainland
arrived
at
the
address
of
president
barbicane
the
president
tore
open
the
envelope
read
the
dispatch
and
despite
his
remarkable
powers
of
his
lips
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
grew
dim
on
reading
the
twenty
words
of
this
telegram

this
astounding
news
instead
of
flying
through
the
electric
wires
had
simply
arrived
by
post
in
the
ordinary
sealed
envelope
barbicane
would
not
have
hesitated
a
moment
he
would
have
held
his
tongue
about
it
both
as
a
measure
of
prudence
and
in
order
not
to
have
to
reconsider
his
plans
this
telegram
might
be
a
cover
for
some
jest
especially
as
it
came
from
a
frenchman
what
human
being
would
ever
have
conceived
the
idea
of
such
a
journey
and
if
such
a
person
really
existed
he
must
be
an
idiot
whom
one
would
shut
up
in
a
lunatic
ward
rather
than
within
the
walls
of
the
projectile
the
contents
of
the
dispatch
however
speedily
became
known
for
the
telegraphic
officials
possessed
but
little
discretion
and
michel
ardan
proposition
ran
at
once
throughout
the
several
states
of
the
union
barbicane
had
therefore
no
further
motives
for
keeping
silence
consequently
he
called
together
such
of
his
colleagues
as
were
at
the
moment
in
tampa
town
and
without
any
expression
of
his
own
opinions
simply
read
to
them
the
laconic
text
itself
it
was
received
with
every
possible
variety
of
expressions
of
doubt
incredulity
and
derision
from
every
one
with
the
exception
of
maston
who
exclaimed
it
is
a
grand
idea
however
when
barbicane
originally
proposed
to
send
a
shot
to
the
moon
every
one
looked
upon
the
enterprise
as
simple
and
practicable
enough
a
mere
question
of
gunnery
but
when
a
person
professing
to
be
a
reasonable
being
offered
to
take
passage
within
the
projectile
the
whole
thing
became
a
farce
or
in
plainer
language
a
humbug
one
question
however
remained
did
such
a
being
exist
this
telegram
flashed
across
the
depths
of
the
atlantic
the
designation
of
the
vessel
on
board
which
he
was
to
take
his
passage
the
date
assigned
for
his
speedy
arrival
all
combined
to
impart
a
certain
character
of
reality
to
the
proposal
they
must
get
some
clearer
notion
of
the
matter
scattered
groups
of
inquirers
at
length
condensed
themselves
into
a
compact
crowd
which
made
straight
for
the
residence
of
president
barbicane
that
worthy
individual
was
keeping
quiet
with
the
intention
of
watching
events
as
they
arose
but
he
had
forgotten
to
take
into
account
the
public
impatience
and
it
was
with
no
pleasant
countenance
that
he
watched
the
population
of
tampa
town
gathering
under
his
windows
the
murmurs
and
vociferations
below
presently
obliged
him
to
appear
he
came
forward
therefore
and
on
silence
being
procured
a
citizen
put
to
him
the
following
question
is
the
person
mentioned
in
the
telegram
under
the
name
of
michel
ardan
on
his
way
here
yes
or
no
gentlemen
replied
barbicane
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
we
must
know
roared
the
impatient
voices
time
will
show
calmly
replied
the
president
time
has
no
business
to
keep
a
whole
country
in
suspense
replied
the
orator
have
you
altered
the
plans
of
the
projectile
according
to
the
request
of
the
telegram
not
yet
gentlemen
but
you
are
right
we
must
have
better
information
to
go
by
the
telegraph
must
complete
its
information
to
the
telegraph
roared
the
crowd
barbicane
descended
and
heading
the
immense
assemblage
led
the
way
to
the
telegraph
office
a
few
minutes
later
a
telegram
was
dispatched
to
the
secretary
of
the
underwriters
at
liverpool
requesting
answers
to
the
following
queries
about
the
ship
atlanta
when
did
she
leave
europe
had
she
on
board
a
frenchman
named
michel
ardan
two
hours
afterward
barbicane
received
information
too
exact
to
leave
room
for
the
smallest
remaining
doubt
the
steamer
atlanta
from
liverpool
put
to
sea
on
the
of
october
bound
for
tampa
town
having
on
board
a
frenchman
borne
on
the
list
of
passengers
by
the
name
of
michel
ardan
that
very
evening
he
wrote
to
the
house
of
breadwill
and
requesting
them
to
suspend
the
casting
of
the
projectile
until
the
receipt
of
further
orders
on
the
of
october
at
nine
the
semaphores
of
the
bahama
canal
signaled
a
thick
smoke
on
the
horizon
two
hours
later
a
large
steamer
exchanged
signals
with
them
the
name
of
the
atlanta
flew
at
once
over
tampa
town
at
four
the
english
vessel
entered
the
bay
of
espiritu
santo
at
five
it
crossed
the
passage
of
hillisborough
bay
at
full
steam
at
six
she
cast
anchor
at
port
tampa
the
anchor
had
scarcely
caught
the
sandy
bottom
when
five
hundred
boats
surrounded
the
atlanta
and
the
steamer
was
taken
by
assault
barbicane
was
the
first
to
set
foot
on
deck
and
in
a
voice
of
which
he
vainly
tried
to
conceal
the
emotion
called
michel
ardan
here
replied
an
individual
perched
on
the
poop
barbicane
with
arms
crossed
looked
fixedly
at
the
passenger
of
the
atlanta
he
was
a
man
of
about
years
of
age
of
large
build
but
slightly
his
massive
head
momentarily
shook
a
shock
of
reddish
hair
which
resembled
a
lion
mane
his
face
was
short
with
a
broad
forehead
and
furnished
with
a
moustache
as
bristly
as
a
cat
and
little
patches
of
yellowish
whiskers
upon
full
cheeks
round
wildish
eyes
slightly
completed
a
physiognomy
essentially
feline
his
nose
was
firmly
shaped
his
mouth
particularly
sweet
in
expression
high
forehead
intelligent
and
furrowed
with
wrinkles
like
a
field
the
body
was
powerfully
developed
and
firmly
fixed
upon
long
legs
muscular
arms
and
a
general
air
of
decision
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
hardy
jolly
companion
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
ample
dimensions
loose
neckerchief
open
shirtcollar
disclosing
a
robust
neck
his
cuffs
were
invariably
unbuttoned
through
which
appeared
a
pair
of
red
hands
on
the
bridge
of
the
steamer
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
he
bustled
to
and
fro
never
still
for
a
moment
dragging
his
anchors
as
the
sailors
say
gesticulating
making
free
with
everybody
biting
his
nails
with
nervous
avidity
he
was
one
of
those
originals
which
nature
sometimes
invents
in
the
freak
of
a
moment
and
of
which
she
then
breaks
the
mould
among
other
peculiarities
this
curiosity
gave
himself
out
for
a
sublime
ignoramus
like
shakespeare
and
professed
supreme
contempt
for
all
scientific
men
those
fellows
as
he
called
them
are
only
fit
to
mark
the
points
while
we
play
the
game
he
was
in
fact
a
thorough
bohemian
adventurous
but
not
an
adventurer
a
fellow
a
kind
of
icarus
only
possessing
relays
of
wings
for
the
rest
he
was
ever
in
scrapes
ending
invariably
by
falling
on
his
feet
like
those
little
figures
which
they
sell
for
children
toys
in
a
few
words
his
motto
was
i
have
my
opinions
and
the
love
of
the
impossible
constituted
his
ruling
passion
such
was
the
passenger
of
the
atlanta
always
excitable
as
if
boiling
under
the
action
of
some
internal
fire
by
the
character
of
his
physical
organization
if
ever
two
individuals
offered
a
striking
contrast
to
each
other
these
were
certainly
michel
ardan
and
the
yankee
barbicane
both
moreover
being
equally
enterprising
and
daring
each
in
his
own
way
the
scrutiny
which
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
instituted
regarding
this
new
rival
was
quickly
interrupted
by
the
shouts
and
hurrahs
of
the
crowd
the
cries
became
at
last
so
uproarious
and
the
popular
enthusiasm
assumed
so
personal
a
form
that
michel
ardan
after
having
shaken
hands
some
thousands
of
times
at
the
imminent
risk
of
leaving
his
fingers
behind
him
was
fain
at
last
to
make
a
bolt
for
his
cabin
barbicane
followed
him
without
uttering
a
word
you
are
barbicane
i
suppose
said
michel
ardan
in
a
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
would
have
addressed
a
friend
of
twenty
years
standing
yes
replied
the
president
of
the
gun
club
all
right
how
d
do
barbicane
how
are
you
getting
on
pretty
well
that
right
so
said
barbicane
without
further
preliminary
you
are
quite
determined
to
go
quite
decided
nothing
will
stop
you
nothing
have
you
modified
your
projectile
according
to
my
telegram
i
waited
for
your
arrival
but
asked
barbicane
again
have
you
carefully
reflected
reflected
have
i
any
time
to
spare
i
find
an
opportunity
of
making
a
tour
in
the
moon
and
i
mean
to
profit
by
it
there
is
the
whole
gist
of
the
matter
barbicane
looked
hard
at
this
man
who
spoke
so
lightly
of
his
project
with
such
complete
absence
of
anxiety
but
at
least
said
he
you
have
some
plans
some
means
of
carrying
your
project
into
execution
excellent
my
dear
barbicane
only
permit
me
to
offer
one
remark
my
wish
is
to
tell
my
story
once
for
all
to
everybody
and
then
have
done
with
it
then
there
will
be
no
need
for
recapitulation
so
if
you
have
no
objection
assemble
your
friends
colleagues
the
whole
town
all
florida
all
america
if
you
like
and
i
shall
be
ready
to
explain
my
plans
and
answer
any
objections
whatever
that
may
be
advanced
you
may
rest
assured
i
shall
wait
without
stirring
will
that
suit
you
all
right
replied
barbicane
so
saying
the
president
left
the
cabin
and
informed
the
crowd
of
the
proposal
of
michel
ardan
his
words
were
received
with
clappings
of
hands
and
shouts
of
joy
they
had
removed
all
difficulties
every
one
would
contemplate
at
his
ease
this
european
hero
however
some
of
the
spectators
more
infatuated
than
the
rest
would
not
leave
the
deck
of
the
atlanta
they
passed
the
night
on
board
among
others
maston
got
his
hook
fixed
in
the
combing
of
the
poop
and
it
pretty
nearly
required
the
capstan
to
get
it
out
again
he
is
a
hero
a
hero
he
cried
a
theme
of
which
he
was
never
tired
of
ringing
the
changes
and
we
are
only
like
weak
silly
women
compared
with
this
european
as
to
the
president
after
having
suggested
to
the
visitors
it
was
time
to
retire
he
the
passenger
cabin
and
remained
there
till
the
bell
of
the
steamer
made
it
midnight
but
then
the
two
rivals
in
popularity
shook
hands
heartily
and
parted
on
terms
of
intimate
friendship
chapter
xix
a
monster
meeting
on
the
following
day
barbicane
fearing
that
indiscreet
questions
might
be
put
to
michel
ardan
was
desirous
of
reducing
the
number
of
the
audience
to
a
few
of
the
initiated
his
own
colleagues
for
instance
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
check
the
falls
of
niagara
he
was
compelled
therefore
to
give
up
the
idea
and
let
his
new
friend
run
the
chances
of
a
public
conference
the
place
chosen
for
this
monster
meeting
was
a
vast
plain
situated
in
the
rear
of
the
town
in
a
few
hours
thanks
to
the
help
of
the
shipping
in
port
an
immense
roofing
of
canvas
was
stretched
over
the
parched
prairie
and
protected
it
from
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
there
three
hundred
thousand
people
braved
for
many
hours
the
stifling
heat
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
frenchman
of
this
crowd
of
spectators
a
first
set
could
both
see
and
hear
a
second
set
saw
badly
and
heard
nothing
at
all
and
as
for
the
third
it
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
at
all
at
three
michel
ardan
made
his
appearance
accompanied
by
the
principal
members
of
the
gun
club
he
was
supported
on
his
right
by
president
barbicane
and
on
his
left
by
maston
more
radiant
than
the
midday
sun
and
nearly
as
ruddy
ardan
mounted
a
platform
from
the
top
of
which
his
view
extended
over
a
sea
of
black
hats
he
exhibited
not
the
slightest
embarrassment
he
was
just
as
gay
familiar
and
pleasant
as
if
he
were
at
home
to
the
hurrahs
which
greeted
him
he
replied
by
a
graceful
bow
then
waving
his
hands
to
request
silence
he
spoke
in
perfectly
correct
english
as
follows
gentlemen
despite
the
very
hot
weather
i
request
your
patience
for
a
short
time
while
i
offer
some
explanations
regarding
the
projects
which
seem
to
have
so
interested
you
i
am
neither
an
orator
nor
a
man
of
science
and
i
had
no
idea
of
addressing
you
in
public
but
my
friend
barbicane
has
told
me
that
you
would
like
to
hear
me
and
i
am
quite
at
your
service
listen
to
me
therefore
with
your
six
hundred
thousand
ears
and
please
excuse
the
faults
of
the
speaker
now
pray
do
not
forget
that
you
see
before
you
a
perfect
ignoramus
whose
ignorance
goes
so
far
that
he
can
not
even
understand
the
difficulties
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
matter
quite
simple
natural
and
easy
to
take
one
place
in
a
projectile
and
start
for
the
moon
that
journey
must
be
undertaken
sooner
or
later
and
as
for
the
mode
of
locomotion
adopted
it
follows
simply
the
law
of
progress
man
began
by
walking
on
then
one
fine
day
on
two
feet
then
in
a
carriage
then
in
a
and
lastly
by
railway
well
the
projectile
is
the
vehicle
of
the
future
and
the
planets
themselves
are
nothing
else
now
some
of
you
gentlemen
may
imagine
that
the
velocity
we
propose
to
impart
to
it
is
extravagant
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
all
the
stars
exceed
it
in
rapidity
and
the
earth
herself
is
at
this
moment
carrying
us
round
the
sun
at
three
times
as
rapid
a
rate
and
yet
she
is
a
mere
lounger
on
the
way
compared
with
many
others
of
the
planets
and
her
velocity
is
constantly
decreasing
is
it
not
evident
then
i
ask
you
that
there
will
some
day
appear
velocities
far
greater
than
these
of
which
light
or
electricity
will
probably
be
the
mechanical
agent
yes
gentlemen
continued
the
orator
in
spite
of
the
opinions
of
certain
people
who
would
shut
up
the
human
race
upon
this
globe
as
within
some
magic
circle
which
it
must
never
outstep
we
shall
one
day
travel
to
the
moon
the
planets
and
the
stars
with
the
same
facility
rapidity
and
certainty
as
we
now
make
the
voyage
from
liverpool
to
new
york
distance
is
but
a
relative
expression
and
must
end
by
being
reduced
to
zero
the
assembly
strongly
predisposed
as
they
were
in
favor
of
the
french
hero
were
slightly
staggered
at
this
bold
theory
michel
ardan
perceived
the
fact
gentlemen
he
continued
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
do
not
seem
quite
convinced
very
good
let
us
reason
the
matter
out
do
you
know
how
long
it
would
take
for
an
express
train
to
reach
the
moon
three
hundred
days
no
more
and
what
is
that
the
distance
is
no
more
than
nine
times
the
circumference
of
the
earth
and
there
are
no
sailors
or
travelers
of
even
moderate
activity
who
have
not
made
longer
journeys
than
that
in
their
lifetime
and
now
consider
that
i
shall
be
only
seven
hours
on
my
journey
ah
i
see
you
are
reckoning
that
the
moon
is
a
long
way
off
from
the
earth
and
that
one
must
think
twice
before
making
the
experiment
what
would
you
say
then
if
we
were
talking
of
going
to
neptune
which
revolves
at
a
distance
of
more
than
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
twenty
millions
of
miles
from
the
sun
and
yet
what
is
that
compared
with
the
distance
of
the
fixed
stars
some
of
which
such
as
arcturus
are
billions
of
miles
distant
from
us
and
then
you
talk
of
the
distance
which
separates
the
planets
from
the
sun
and
there
are
people
who
affirm
that
such
a
thing
as
distance
exists
absurdity
folly
idiotic
nonsense
would
you
know
what
i
think
of
our
own
solar
universe
shall
i
tell
you
my
theory
it
is
very
simple
in
my
opinion
the
solar
system
is
a
solid
homogeneous
body
the
planets
which
compose
it
are
in
actual
contact
with
each
other
and
whatever
space
exists
between
them
is
nothing
more
than
the
space
which
separates
the
molecules
of
the
densest
metal
such
as
silver
iron
or
platinum
i
have
the
right
therefore
to
affirm
and
i
repeat
with
the
conviction
which
must
penetrate
all
your
minds
is
but
an
empty
name
distance
does
not
really
exist
hurrah
cried
one
voice
need
it
be
said
it
was
that
of
maston
distance
does
not
exist
and
overcome
by
the
energy
of
his
movements
he
nearly
fell
from
the
platform
to
the
ground
he
just
escaped
a
severe
fall
which
would
have
proved
to
him
that
distance
was
by
no
means
an
empty
name
gentlemen
resumed
the
orator
i
repeat
that
the
distance
between
the
earth
and
her
satellite
is
a
mere
trifle
and
undeserving
of
serious
consideration
i
am
convinced
that
before
twenty
years
are
over
of
our
earth
will
have
paid
a
visit
to
the
moon
now
my
worthy
friends
if
you
have
any
question
to
put
to
me
you
will
i
fear
sadly
embarrass
a
poor
man
like
myself
still
i
will
do
my
best
to
answer
you
up
to
this
point
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
been
satisfied
with
the
turn
which
the
discussion
had
assumed
it
became
now
however
desirable
to
divert
ardan
from
questions
of
a
practical
nature
with
which
he
was
doubtless
far
less
conversant
barbicane
therefore
hastened
to
get
in
a
word
and
began
by
asking
his
new
friend
whether
he
thought
that
the
moon
and
the
planets
were
inhabited
you
put
before
me
a
great
problem
my
worthy
president
replied
the
orator
smiling
still
men
of
great
intelligence
such
as
plutarch
swedenborg
bernardin
de
pierre
and
others
have
if
i
mistake
not
pronounced
in
the
affirmative
looking
at
the
question
from
the
natural
philosopher
point
of
view
i
should
say
that
nothing
useless
existed
in
the
world
and
replying
to
your
question
by
another
i
should
venture
to
assert
that
if
these
worlds
are
habitable
they
either
are
have
been
or
will
be
inhabited
no
one
could
answer
more
logically
or
fairly
replied
the
president
the
question
then
reverts
to
this
are
these
worlds
habitable
for
my
own
part
i
believe
they
are
for
myself
i
feel
certain
of
it
said
michel
ardan
nevertheless
retorted
one
of
the
audience
there
are
many
arguments
against
the
habitability
of
the
worlds
the
conditions
of
life
must
evidently
be
greatly
modified
upon
the
majority
of
them
to
mention
only
the
planets
we
should
be
either
broiled
alive
in
some
or
frozen
to
death
in
others
according
as
they
are
more
or
less
removed
from
the
sun
i
regret
replied
michel
ardan
that
i
have
not
the
honor
of
personally
knowing
my
contradictor
for
i
would
have
attempted
to
answer
him
his
objection
has
its
merits
i
admit
but
i
think
we
may
successfully
combat
it
as
well
as
all
others
which
affect
the
habitability
of
other
worlds
if
i
were
a
natural
philosopher
i
would
tell
him
that
if
less
of
caloric
were
set
in
motion
upon
the
planets
which
are
nearest
to
the
sun
and
more
on
the
contrary
upon
those
which
are
farthest
removed
from
it
this
simple
fact
would
alone
suffice
to
equalize
the
heat
and
to
render
the
temperature
of
those
worlds
supportable
by
beings
organized
like
ourselves
if
i
were
a
naturalist
i
would
tell
him
that
according
to
some
illustrious
men
of
science
nature
has
furnished
us
with
instances
upon
the
earth
of
animals
existing
under
very
varying
conditions
of
life
that
fish
respire
in
a
medium
fatal
to
other
animals
that
amphibious
creatures
possess
a
double
existence
very
difficult
of
explanation
that
certain
denizens
of
the
seas
maintain
life
at
enormous
depths
and
there
support
a
pressure
equal
to
that
of
fifty
or
sixty
atmospheres
without
being
crushed
that
several
aquatic
insects
insensible
to
temperature
are
met
with
equally
among
boiling
springs
and
in
the
frozen
plains
of
the
polar
sea
in
fine
that
we
can
not
help
recognizing
in
nature
a
diversity
of
means
of
operation
oftentimes
incomprehensible
but
not
the
less
real
if
i
were
a
chemist
i
would
tell
him
that
the
aerolites
bodies
evidently
formed
exteriorly
of
our
terrestrial
globe
have
upon
analysis
revealed
indisputable
traces
of
carbon
a
substance
which
owes
its
origin
solely
to
organized
beings
and
which
according
to
the
experiments
of
reichenbach
must
necessarily
itself
have
been
endued
with
animation
and
lastly
were
i
a
theologian
i
would
tell
him
that
the
scheme
of
the
divine
redemption
according
to
paul
seems
to
be
applicable
not
merely
to
the
earth
but
to
all
the
celestial
worlds
but
unfortunately
i
am
neither
theologian
nor
chemist
nor
naturalist
nor
philosopher
therefore
in
my
absolute
ignorance
of
the
great
laws
which
govern
the
universe
i
confine
myself
to
saying
in
reply
do
not
know
whether
the
worlds
are
inhabited
or
not
and
since
i
do
not
know
i
am
going
to
see
whether
michel
ardan
antagonist
hazarded
any
further
arguments
or
not
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
the
uproarious
shouts
of
the
crowd
would
not
allow
any
expression
of
opinion
to
gain
a
hearing
on
silence
being
restored
the
triumphant
orator
contented
himself
with
adding
the
following
remarks
gentlemen
you
will
observe
that
i
have
but
slightly
touched
upon
this
great
question
there
is
another
altogether
different
line
of
argument
in
favor
of
the
habitability
of
the
stars
which
i
omit
for
the
present
i
only
desire
to
call
attention
to
one
point
to
those
who
maintain
that
the
planets
are
inhabited
one
may
reply
you
might
be
perfectly
in
the
right
if
you
could
only
show
that
the
earth
is
the
best
possible
world
in
spite
of
what
voltaire
has
said
she
has
but
satellite
while
jupiter
uranus
saturn
neptune
have
each
several
an
advantage
by
no
means
to
be
despised
but
that
which
renders
our
own
globe
so
uncomfortable
is
the
inclination
of
its
axis
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
hence
the
inequality
of
days
and
nights
hence
the
disagreeable
diversity
of
the
seasons
on
the
surface
of
our
unhappy
spheroid
we
are
always
either
too
hot
or
too
cold
we
are
frozen
in
winter
broiled
in
summer
it
is
the
planet
of
rheumatism
coughs
bronchitis
while
on
the
surface
of
jupiter
for
example
where
the
axis
is
but
slightly
inclined
the
inhabitants
may
enjoy
uniform
temperatures
it
possesses
zones
of
perpetual
springs
summers
autumns
and
winters
every
jovian
may
choose
for
himself
what
climate
he
likes
and
there
spend
the
whole
of
his
life
in
security
from
all
variations
of
temperature
you
will
i
am
sure
readily
admit
this
superiority
of
jupiter
over
our
own
planet
to
say
nothing
of
his
years
which
each
equal
twelve
of
ours
under
such
auspices
and
such
marvelous
conditions
of
existence
it
appears
to
me
that
the
inhabitants
of
so
fortunate
a
world
must
be
in
every
respect
superior
to
ourselves
all
we
require
in
order
to
attain
such
perfection
is
the
mere
trifle
of
having
an
axis
of
rotation
less
inclined
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
hurrah
roared
an
energetic
voice
let
us
unite
our
efforts
invent
the
necessary
machines
and
rectify
the
earth
axis
a
thunder
of
applause
followed
this
proposal
the
author
of
which
was
of
course
no
other
than
maston
and
in
all
probability
if
the
truth
must
be
told
if
the
yankees
could
only
have
found
a
point
of
application
for
it
they
would
have
constructed
a
lever
capable
of
raising
the
earth
and
rectifying
its
axis
it
was
just
this
deficiency
which
baffled
these
daring
mechanicians
chapter

attack
and
riposte
as
soon
as
the
excitement
had
subsided
the
following
words
were
heard
uttered
in
a
strong
and
determined
voice
now
that
the
speaker
has
favored
us
with
so
much
imagination
would
he
be
so
good
as
to
return
to
his
subject
and
give
us
a
little
practical
view
of
the
question
all
eyes
were
directed
toward
the
person
who
spoke
he
was
a
little
man
of
an
active
figure
with
an
american
goatee
beard
profiting
by
the
different
movements
in
the
crowd
he
had
managed
by
degrees
to
gain
the
front
row
of
spectators
there
with
arms
crossed
and
stern
gaze
he
watched
the
hero
of
the
meeting
after
having
put
his
question
he
remained
silent
and
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
the
thousands
of
looks
directed
toward
himself
nor
of
the
murmur
of
disapprobation
excited
by
his
words
meeting
at
first
with
no
reply
he
repeated
his
question
with
marked
emphasis
adding
we
are
here
to
talk
about
the
and
not
about
the
you
are
right
sir
replied
michel
ardan
the
discussion
has
become
irregular
we
will
return
to
the
moon
sir
said
the
unknown
you
pretend
that
our
satellite
is
inhabited
very
good
but
if
selenites
do
exist
that
race
of
beings
assuredly
must
live
without
breathing
for
i
warn
you
for
your
own
sake
there
is
not
the
smallest
particle
of
air
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
at
this
remark
ardan
pushed
up
his
shock
of
red
hair
he
saw
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
being
involved
in
a
struggle
with
this
person
upon
the
very
gist
of
the
whole
question
he
looked
sternly
at
him
in
his
turn
and
said
oh
so
there
is
no
air
in
the
moon
and
pray
if
you
are
so
good
who
ventures
to
affirm
that
the
men
of
science
really
really
sir
replied
michel
pleasantry
apart
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
men
of
science
who
do
possess
science
but
a
profound
contempt
for
men
of
science
who
do
not
do
you
know
any
who
belong
to
the
latter
category
decidedly
in
france
there
are
some
who
maintain
that
mathematically
a
bird
can
not
possibly
fly
and
others
who
demonstrate
theoretically
that
fishes
were
never
made
to
live
in
water
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
persons
of
that
description
and
i
can
quote
in
support
of
my
statement
names
which
you
can
not
refuse
deference
to
then
sir
you
will
sadly
embarrass
a
poor
ignorant
who
besides
asks
nothing
better
than
to
learn
why
then
do
you
introduce
scientific
questions
if
you
have
never
studied
them
asked
the
unknown
somewhat
coarsely
for
the
reason
that
is
always
brave
who
never
suspects
danger
i
know
nothing
it
is
true
but
it
is
precisely
my
very
weakness
which
constitutes
my
strength
your
weakness
amounts
to
folly
retorted
the
unknown
in
a
passion
all
the
better
replied
our
frenchman
if
it
carries
me
up
to
the
moon
barbicane
and
his
colleagues
devoured
with
their
eyes
the
intruder
who
had
so
boldly
placed
himself
in
antagonism
to
their
enterprise
nobody
knew
him
and
the
president
uneasy
as
to
the
result
of
so
free
a
discussion
watched
his
new
friend
with
some
anxiety
the
meeting
began
to
be
somewhat
fidgety
also
for
the
contest
directed
their
attention
to
the
dangers
if
not
the
actual
impossibilities
of
the
proposed
expedition
sir
replied
ardan
antagonist
there
are
many
and
incontrovertible
reasons
which
prove
the
absence
of
an
atmosphere
in
the
moon
i
might
say
that
if
one
ever
did
exist
it
must
have
been
absorbed
by
the
earth
but
i
prefer
to
bring
forward
indisputable
facts
bring
them
forward
then
sir
as
many
as
you
please
you
know
said
the
stranger
that
when
any
luminous
rays
cross
a
medium
such
as
the
air
they
are
deflected
out
of
the
straight
line
in
other
words
they
undergo
refraction
well
when
stars
are
occulted
by
the
moon
their
rays
on
grazing
the
edge
of
her
disc
exhibit
not
the
least
deviation
nor
offer
the
slightest
indication
of
refraction
it
follows
therefore
that
the
moon
can
not
be
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
in
point
of
fact
replied
ardan
this
is
your
chief
if
not
your
argument
and
a
really
scientific
man
might
be
puzzled
to
answer
it
for
myself
i
will
simply
say
that
it
is
defective
because
it
assumes
that
the
angular
diameter
of
the
moon
has
been
completely
determined
which
is
not
the
case
but
let
us
proceed
tell
me
my
dear
sir
do
you
admit
the
existence
of
volcanoes
on
the
moon
surface
extinct
yes
in
activity
no
these
volcanoes
however
were
at
one
time
in
a
state
of
activity
true
but
as
they
furnish
themselves
the
oxygen
necessary
for
combustion
the
mere
fact
of
their
eruption
does
not
prove
the
presence
of
an
atmosphere
proceed
again
then
and
let
us
set
aside
this
class
of
arguments
in
order
to
come
to
direct
observations
in
the
astronomers
louville
and
halley
watching
the
eclipse
of
the
of
may
remarked
some
very
extraordinary
scintillations
these
jets
of
light
rapid
in
nature
and
of
frequent
recurrence
they
attributed
to
thunderstorms
generated
in
the
lunar
atmosphere
in
replied
the
unknown
the
astronomers
louville
and
halley
mistook
for
lunar
phenomena
some
which
were
purely
terrestrial
such
as
meteoric
or
other
bodies
which
are
generated
in
our
own
atmosphere
this
was
the
scientific
explanation
at
the
time
of
the
facts
and
that
is
my
answer
now
on
again
then
replied
ardan
herschel
in
observed
a
great
number
of
luminous
points
on
the
moon
surface
did
he
not
yes
but
without
offering
any
solution
of
them
herschel
himself
never
inferred
from
them
the
necessity
of
a
lunar
atmosphere
and
i
may
add
that
baeer
and
maedler
the
two
great
authorities
upon
the
moon
are
quite
agreed
as
to
the
entire
absence
of
air
on
its
surface
a
movement
was
here
manifest
among
the
assemblage
who
appeared
to
be
growing
excited
by
the
arguments
of
this
singular
personage
let
us
proceed
replied
ardan
with
perfect
coolness
and
come
to
one
important
fact
a
skillful
french
astronomer
laussedat
in
watching
the
eclipse
of
july
probed
that
the
horns
of
the
lunar
crescent
were
rounded
and
truncated
now
this
appearance
could
only
have
been
produced
by
a
deviation
of
the
solar
rays
in
traversing
the
atmosphere
of
the
moon
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
of
the
facts
but
is
this
established
as
a
fact
absolutely
certain
a
here
took
place
in
favor
of
the
hero
of
the
meeting
whose
opponent
was
now
reduced
to
silence
ardan
resumed
the
conversation
and
without
exhibiting
any
exultation
at
the
advantage
he
had
gained
simply
said
you
see
then
my
dear
sir
we
must
not
pronounce
with
absolute
positiveness
against
the
existence
of
an
atmosphere
in
the
moon
that
atmosphere
is
probably
of
extreme
rarity
nevertheless
at
the
present
day
science
generally
admits
that
it
exists
not
in
the
mountains
at
all
events
returned
the
unknown
unwilling
to
give
in
no
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
valleys
and
not
exceeding
a
few
hundred
feet
in
height
in
any
case
you
will
do
well
to
take
every
precaution
for
the
air
will
be
terribly
rarified
my
good
sir
there
will
always
be
enough
for
a
solitary
individual
besides
once
arrived
up
there
i
shall
do
my
best
to
economize
and
not
to
breathe
except
on
grand
occasions
a
tremendous
roar
of
laughter
rang
in
the
ears
of
the
mysterious
interlocutor
who
glared
fiercely
round
upon
the
assembly
then
continued
ardan
with
a
careless
air
since
we
are
in
accord
regarding
the
presence
of
a
certain
atmosphere
we
are
forced
to
admit
the
presence
of
a
certain
quantity
of
water
this
is
a
happy
consequence
for
me
moreover
my
amiable
contradictor
permit
me
to
submit
to
you
one
further
observation
we
only
know
side
of
the
moon
disc
and
if
there
is
but
little
air
on
the
face
presented
to
us
it
is
possible
that
there
is
plenty
on
the
one
turned
away
from
us
and
for
what
reason
because
the
moon
under
the
action
of
the
earth
attraction
has
assumed
the
form
of
an
egg
which
we
look
at
from
the
smaller
end
hence
it
follows
by
hausen
calculations
that
its
center
of
gravity
is
situated
in
the
other
hemisphere
hence
it
results
that
the
great
mass
of
air
and
water
must
have
been
drawn
away
to
the
other
face
of
our
satellite
during
the
first
days
of
its
creation
pure
fancies
cried
the
unknown
no
pure
theories
which
are
based
upon
the
laws
of
mechanics
and
it
seems
difficult
to
me
to
refute
them
i
appeal
then
to
this
meeting
and
i
put
it
to
them
whether
life
such
as
exists
upon
the
earth
is
possible
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
three
hundred
thousand
auditors
at
once
applauded
the
proposition
ardan
opponent
tried
to
get
in
another
word
but
he
could
not
obtain
a
hearing
cries
and
menaces
fell
upon
him
like
hail
enough
enough
cried
some
drive
the
intruder
off
shouted
others
turn
him
out
roared
the
exasperated
crowd
but
he
holding
firmly
on
to
the
platform
did
not
budge
an
inch
and
let
the
storm
pass
on
which
would
soon
have
assumed
formidable
proportions
if
michel
ardan
had
not
quieted
it
by
a
gesture
he
was
too
chivalrous
to
abandon
his
opponent
in
an
apparent
extremity
you
wished
to
say
a
few
more
words
he
asked
in
a
pleasant
voice
yes
a
thousand
or
rather
no
only
one
if
you
persevere
in
your
enterprise
you
must
be
a
very
rash
person
how
can
you
treat
me
as
such
me
who
have
demanded
a
projectile
in
order
to
prevent
turning
round
and
round
on
my
way
like
a
squirrel
but
unhappy
man
the
dreadful
recoil
will
smash
you
to
pieces
at
your
starting
my
dear
contradictor
you
have
just
put
your
finger
upon
the
true
and
only
difficulty
nevertheless
i
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
the
industrial
genius
of
the
americans
not
to
believe
that
they
will
succeed
in
overcoming
it
but
the
heat
developed
by
the
rapidity
of
the
projectile
in
crossing
the
strata
of
air
oh
the
walls
are
thick
and
i
shall
soon
have
crossed
the
atmosphere
but
victuals
and
water
i
have
calculated
for
a
twelvemonth
supply
and
i
shall
be
only
four
days
on
the
journey
but
for
air
to
breathe
on
the
road
i
shall
make
it
by
a
chemical
process
but
your
fall
on
the
moon
supposing
you
ever
reach
it
it
will
be
six
times
less
dangerous
than
a
sudden
fall
upon
the
earth
because
the
weight
will
be
only
as
great
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
still
it
will
be
enough
to
smash
you
like
glass
what
is
to
prevent
my
retarding
the
shock
by
means
of
rockets
conveniently
placed
and
lighted
at
the
right
moment
but
after
all
supposing
all
difficulties
surmounted
all
obstacles
removed
supposing
everything
combined
to
favor
you
and
granting
that
you
may
arrive
safe
and
sound
in
the
moon
how
will
you
come
back
i
am
not
coming
back
at
this
reply
almost
sublime
in
its
very
simplicity
the
assembly
became
silent
but
its
silence
was
more
eloquent
than
could
have
been
its
cries
of
enthusiasm
the
unknown
profited
by
the
opportunity
and
once
more
protested
you
will
inevitably
kill
yourself
he
cried
and
your
death
will
be
that
of
a
madman
useless
even
to
science
go
on
my
dear
unknown
for
truly
your
prophecies
are
most
agreeable
it
really
is
too
much
cried
michel
ardan
adversary
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
continue
so
frivolous
a
discussion
please
yourself
about
this
insane
expedition
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
you
pray
do
stand
upon
ceremony
no
another
person
is
responsible
for
your
act
who
may
i
ask
demanded
michel
ardan
in
an
imperious
tone
the
ignoramus
who
organized
this
equally
absurd
and
impossible
experiment
the
attack
was
direct
barbicane
ever
since
the
interference
of
the
unknown
had
been
making
fearful
efforts
of
now
however
seeing
himself
directly
attacked
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
he
rose
suddenly
and
was
rushing
upon
the
enemy
who
thus
braved
him
to
the
face
when
all
at
once
he
found
himself
separated
from
him
the
platform
was
lifted
by
a
hundred
strong
arms
and
the
president
of
the
gun
club
shared
with
michel
ardan
triumphal
honors
the
shield
was
heavy
but
the
bearers
came
in
continuous
relays
disputing
struggling
even
fighting
among
themselves
in
their
eagerness
to
lend
their
shoulders
to
this
demonstration
however
the
unknown
had
not
profited
by
the
tumult
to
quit
his
post
besides
he
could
not
have
done
it
in
the
midst
of
that
compact
crowd
there
he
held
on
in
the
front
row
with
crossed
arms
glaring
at
president
barbicane
the
shouts
of
the
immense
crowd
continued
at
their
highest
pitch
throughout
this
triumphant
march
michel
ardan
took
it
all
with
evident
pleasure
his
face
gleamed
with
delight
several
times
the
platform
seemed
seized
with
pitching
and
rolling
like
a
weatherbeaten
ship
but
the
two
heros
of
the
meeting
had
good
they
never
stumbled
and
their
vessel
arrived
without
dues
at
the
port
of
tampa
town
michel
ardan
managed
fortunately
to
escape
from
the
last
embraces
of
his
vigorous
admirers
he
made
for
the
hotel
franklin
quickly
gained
his
chamber
and
slid
under
the
bedclothes
while
an
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
kept
watch
under
his
windows
during
this
time
a
scene
short
grave
and
decisive
took
place
between
the
mysterious
personage
and
the
president
of
the
gun
club
barbicane
free
at
last
had
gone
straight
at
his
adversary
come
he
said
shortly
the
other
followed
him
on
the
quay
and
the
two
presently
found
themselves
alone
at
the
entrance
of
an
open
wharf
on
jones
fall
the
two
enemies
still
mutually
unknown
gazed
at
each
other
who
are
you
asked
barbicane
captain
nicholl
so
i
suspected
hitherto
chance
has
never
thrown
you
in
my
way
i
am
come
for
that
purpose
you
have
insulted
me
publicly
and
you
will
answer
to
me
for
this
insult
at
this
very
moment
no
i
desire
that
all
that
passes
between
us
shall
be
secret
their
is
a
wood
situated
three
miles
from
tampa
the
wood
of
skersnaw
do
you
know
it
i
know
it
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
enter
it
morning
at
five
on
one
side
yes
if
you
will
enter
at
the
other
side
at
the
same
hour
and
you
will
not
forget
your
rifle
said
barbicane
no
more
than
you
will
forget
yours
replied
nicholl
these
words
having
been
coldly
spoken
the
president
of
the
gun
club
and
the
captain
parted
barbicane
returned
to
his
lodging
but
instead
of
snatching
a
few
hours
of
repose
he
passed
the
night
in
endeavoring
to
discover
a
means
of
evading
the
recoil
of
the
projectile
and
resolving
the
difficult
problem
proposed
by
michel
ardan
during
the
discussion
at
the
meeting
chapter
xxi
how
a
frenchman
manages
an
affair
while
the
contract
of
this
duel
was
being
discussed
by
the
president
and
the
captain
this
dreadful
savage
duel
in
which
each
adversary
became
a
michel
ardan
was
resting
from
the
fatigues
of
his
triumph
resting
is
hardly
an
appropriate
expression
for
american
beds
rival
marble
or
granite
tables
for
hardness
ardan
was
sleeping
then
badly
enough
tossing
about
between
the
cloths
which
served
him
for
sheets
and
he
was
dreaming
of
making
a
more
comfortable
couch
in
his
projectile
when
a
frightful
noise
disturbed
his
dreams
thundering
blows
shook
his
door
they
seemed
to
be
caused
by
some
iron
instrument
a
great
deal
of
loud
talking
was
distinguishable
in
this
racket
which
was
rather
too
early
in
the
morning
open
the
door
some
one
shrieked
for
heaven
sake
ardan
saw
no
reason
for
complying
with
a
demand
so
roughly
expressed
however
he
got
up
and
opened
the
door
just
as
it
was
giving
way
before
the
blows
of
this
determined
visitor
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
burst
into
the
room
a
bomb
could
not
have
made
more
noise
or
have
entered
the
room
with
less
ceremony
last
night
cried
maston
our
president
was
publicly
insulted
during
the
meeting
he
provoked
his
adversary
who
is
none
other
than
captain
nicholl
they
are
fighting
this
morning
in
the
wood
of
skersnaw
i
heard
all
the
particulars
from
the
mouth
of
barbicane
himself
if
he
is
killed
then
our
scheme
is
at
an
end
we
must
prevent
his
duel
and
one
man
alone
has
enough
influence
over
barbicane
to
stop
him
and
that
man
is
michel
ardan
while
maston
was
speaking
michel
ardan
without
interrupting
him
had
hastily
put
on
his
clothes
and
in
less
than
two
minutes
the
two
friends
were
making
for
the
suburbs
of
tampa
town
with
rapid
strides
it
was
during
this
walk
that
maston
told
ardan
the
state
of
the
case
he
told
him
the
real
causes
of
the
hostility
between
barbicane
and
nicholl
how
it
was
of
old
date
and
why
thanks
to
unknown
friends
the
president
and
the
captain
had
as
yet
never
met
face
to
face
he
added
that
it
arose
simply
from
a
rivalry
between
iron
plates
and
shot
and
finally
that
the
scene
at
the
meeting
was
only
the
opportunity
for
nicholl
to
pay
off
an
old
grudge
nothing
is
more
dreadful
than
private
duels
in
america
the
two
adversaries
attack
each
other
like
wild
beasts
then
it
is
that
they
might
well
covet
those
wonderful
properties
of
the
indians
of
the
prairies
their
quick
intelligence
their
ingenious
cunning
their
scent
of
the
enemy
a
single
mistake
a
hesitation
a
single
false
step
may
cause
death
on
these
occasions
yankees
are
often
accompanied
by
their
dogs
and
keep
up
the
struggle
for
hours
what
demons
you
are
cried
michel
ardan
when
his
companion
had
depicted
this
scene
to
him
with
much
energy
yes
we
are
replied
modestly
but
we
had
better
make
haste
though
michel
ardan
and
he
had
crossed
the
plains
still
wet
with
dew
and
had
taken
the
shortest
route
over
creeks
and
ricefields
they
could
not
reach
skersnaw
in
under
five
hours
and
a
half
barbicane
must
have
passed
the
border
half
an
hour
ago
there
was
an
old
bushman
working
there
occupied
in
selling
fagots
from
trees
that
had
been
leveled
by
his
axe
maston
ran
toward
him
saying
have
you
seen
a
man
go
into
the
wood
armed
with
a
rifle
barbicane
the
president
my
best
friend
the
worthy
secretary
of
the
gun
club
thought
that
his
president
must
be
known
by
all
the
world
but
the
bushman
did
not
seem
to
understand
him
a
hunter
said
ardan
a
hunter
yes
replied
the
bushman
long
ago
about
an
hour
too
late
cried
maston
have
you
heard
any
gunshots
asked
ardan
no
not
one
not
one
that
hunter
did
not
look
as
if
he
knew
how
to
hunt
what
is
to
be
done
said
maston
we
must
go
into
the
wood
at
the
risk
of
getting
a
ball
which
is
not
intended
for
us
ah
cried
maston
in
a
tone
which
could
not
be
mistaken
i
would
rather
have
twenty
balls
in
my
own
head
than
one
in
barbicane
forward
then
said
ardan
pressing
his
companion
hand
a
few
moments
later
the
two
friends
had
disappeared
in
the
copse
it
was
a
dense
thicket
in
which
rose
huge
cypresses
sycamores
olives
tamarinds
oaks
and
magnolias
these
different
trees
had
interwoven
their
branches
into
an
inextricable
maze
through
which
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
michel
ardan
and
maston
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
through
the
tall
grass
cutting
themselves
a
path
through
the
strong
creepers
casting
curious
glances
on
the
bushes
and
momentarily
expecting
to
hear
the
sound
of
rifles
as
for
the
traces
which
barbicane
ought
to
have
left
of
his
passage
through
the
wood
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
them
visible
so
they
followed
the
barely
perceptible
paths
along
which
indians
had
tracked
some
enemy
and
which
the
dense
foliage
darkly
overshadowed
after
an
hour
spent
in
vain
pursuit
the
two
stopped
in
intensified
anxiety
it
must
be
all
over
said
maston
discouraged
a
man
like
barbicane
would
not
dodge
with
his
enemy
or
ensnare
him
would
not
even
maneuver
he
is
too
open
too
brave
he
has
gone
straight
ahead
right
into
the
danger
and
doubtless
far
enough
from
the
bushman
for
the
wind
to
prevent
his
hearing
the
report
of
the
rifles
but
surely
replied
michel
ardan
since
we
entered
the
wood
we
should
have
heard
and
what
if
we
came
too
late
cried
maston
in
tones
of
despair
for
once
ardan
had
no
reply
to
make
he
and
maston
resuming
their
walk
in
silence
from
time
to
time
indeed
they
raised
great
shouts
calling
alternately
barbicane
and
nicholl
neither
of
whom
however
answered
their
cries
only
the
birds
awakened
by
the
sound
flew
past
them
and
disappeared
among
the
branches
while
some
frightened
deer
fled
precipitately
before
them
for
another
hour
their
search
was
continued
the
greater
part
of
the
wood
had
been
explored
there
was
nothing
to
reveal
the
presence
of
the
combatants
the
information
of
the
bushman
was
after
all
doubtful
and
ardan
was
about
to
propose
their
abandoning
this
useless
pursuit
when
all
at
once
maston
stopped
hush
said
he
there
is
some
one
down
there
some
one
repeated
michel
ardan
yes
a
man
he
seems
motionless
his
rifle
is
not
in
his
hands
what
can
he
be
doing
but
can
you
recognize
him
asked
ardan
whose
short
sight
was
of
little
use
to
him
in
such
circumstances
yes
yes
he
is
turning
toward
us
answered
maston
and
it
is
captain
nicholl
nicholl
cried
michel
ardan
feeling
a
terrible
pang
of
grief
nicholl
unarmed
he
has
then
no
longer
any
fear
of
his
adversary
let
us
go
to
him
said
michel
ardan
and
find
out
the
truth
but
he
and
his
companion
had
barely
taken
fifty
steps
when
they
paused
to
examine
the
captain
more
attentively
they
expected
to
find
a
bloodthirsty
man
happy
in
his
revenge
on
seeing
him
they
remained
stupefied
a
net
composed
of
very
fine
meshes
hung
between
two
enormous
and
in
the
midst
of
this
snare
with
its
wings
entangled
was
a
poor
little
bird
uttering
pitiful
cries
while
it
vainly
struggled
to
escape
the
who
had
laid
this
snare
was
no
human
being
but
a
venomous
spider
peculiar
to
that
country
as
large
as
a
pigeon
egg
and
armed
with
enormous
claws
the
hideous
creature
instead
of
rushing
on
its
prey
had
beaten
a
sudden
retreat
and
taken
refuge
in
the
upper
branches
of
the
for
a
formidable
enemy
menaced
its
stronghold
here
then
was
nicholl
his
gun
on
the
ground
forgetful
of
danger
trying
if
possible
to
save
the
victim
from
its
cobweb
prison
at
last
it
was
accomplished
and
the
little
bird
flew
joyfully
away
and
disappeared
nicholl
lovingly
watched
its
flight
when
he
heard
these
words
pronounced
by
a
voice
full
of
emotion
you
are
indeed
a
brave
man
he
turned
michel
ardan
was
before
him
repeating
in
a
different
tone
and
a
kindhearted
one
michel
ardan
cried
the
captain
why
are
you
here
to
press
your
hand
nicholl
and
to
prevent
you
from
either
killing
barbicane
or
being
killed
by
him
barbicane
returned
the
captain
i
have
been
looking
for
him
for
the
last
two
hours
in
vain
where
is
he
hiding
nicholl
said
michel
ardan
this
is
not
courteous
we
ought
always
to
treat
an
adversary
with
respect
rest
assureed
if
barbicane
is
still
alive
we
shall
find
him
all
the
more
easily
because
if
he
has
not
like
you
been
amusing
himself
with
freeing
oppressed
birds
he
must
be
looking
for
when
we
have
found
him
michel
ardan
tells
you
this
there
will
be
no
duel
between
you
between
president
barbicane
and
myself
gravely
replied
nicholl
there
is
a
rivalry
which
the
death
of
one
of
us
pooh
pooh
said
ardan
brave
fellows
like
you
indeed
you
shall
not
fight
i
will
fight
sir
no
captain
said
maston
with
much
feeling
i
am
a
friend
of
the
president
his
his
second
self
if
you
really
must
kill
some
one
me
it
will
do
just
as
well
sir
nicholl
replied
seizing
his
rifle
convulsively
these
jokes
our
friend
maston
is
not
joking
replied
ardan
i
fully
understand
his
idea
of
being
killed
himself
in
order
to
save
his
friend
but
neither
he
nor
barbicane
will
fall
before
the
balls
of
captain
nicholl
indeed
i
have
so
attractive
a
proposal
to
make
to
the
two
rivals
that
both
will
be
eager
to
accept
it
what
is
it
asked
nicholl
with
manifest
incredulity
patience
exclaimed
ardan
i
can
only
reveal
it
in
the
presence
of
barbicane
let
us
go
in
search
of
him
then
cried
the
captain
the
three
men
started
off
at
once
the
captain
having
discharged
his
rifle
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
and
advanced
in
silence
another
half
hour
passed
and
the
pursuit
was
still
fruitless
maston
was
oppressed
by
sinister
forebodings
he
looked
fiercely
at
nicholl
asking
himself
whether
the
captain
vengeance
had
already
been
satisfied
and
the
unfortunate
barbicane
shot
was
perhaps
lying
dead
on
some
bloody
track
the
same
thought
seemed
to
occur
to
ardan
and
both
were
casting
inquiring
glances
on
nicholl
when
suddenly
maston
paused
the
motionless
figure
of
a
man
leaning
against
a
gigantic
catalpa
twenty
feet
off
appeared
by
the
foliage
it
is
he
said
maston
barbicane
never
moved
ardan
looked
at
the
captain
but
he
did
not
wince
ardan
went
forward
crying
barbicane
barbicane
no
answer
ardan
rushed
toward
his
friend
but
in
the
act
of
seizing
his
arms
he
stopped
short
and
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
barbicane
pencil
in
hand
was
tracing
geometrical
figures
in
a
memorandum
book
while
his
unloaded
rifle
lay
beside
him
on
the
ground
absorbed
in
his
studies
barbicane
in
his
turn
forgetful
of
the
duel
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
when
ardan
took
his
hand
he
looked
up
and
stared
at
his
visitor
in
astonishment
ah
it
is
you
he
cried
at
last
i
have
found
it
my
friend
i
have
found
it
what
my
plan
what
plan
the
plan
for
countering
the
effect
of
the
shock
at
the
departure
of
the
projectile
indeed
said
michel
ardan
looking
at
the
captain
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
yes
water
simply
water
which
will
act
as
a
spring
ah
maston
cried
barbicane
you
here
also
himself
replied
ardan
and
permit
me
to
introduce
to
you
at
the
same
time
the
worthy
captain
nicholl
nicholl
cried
barbicane
who
jumped
up
at
once
pardon
me
captain
i
had
quite
forgotten
i
am
ready
michel
ardan
interfered
without
giving
the
two
enemies
time
to
say
anything
more
thank
heaven
said
he
it
is
a
happy
thing
that
brave
men
like
you
two
did
not
meet
sooner
we
should
now
have
been
mourning
for
one
or
other
of
you
but
thanks
to
providence
which
has
interfered
there
is
now
no
further
cause
for
alarm
when
one
forgets
one
anger
in
mechanics
or
in
cobwebs
it
is
a
sign
that
the
anger
is
not
dangerous
michel
ardan
then
told
the
president
how
the
captain
had
been
found
occupied
i
put
it
to
you
now
said
he
in
conclusion
are
two
such
good
fellows
as
you
are
made
on
purpose
to
smash
each
other
skulls
with
shot
there
was
in
the
situation
somewhat
of
the
ridiculous
something
quite
unexpected
michel
ardan
saw
this
and
determined
to
effect
a
reconciliation
my
good
friends
said
he
with
his
most
bewitching
smile
this
is
nothing
but
a
misunderstanding
nothing
more
well
to
prove
that
it
is
all
over
between
you
accept
frankly
the
proposal
i
am
going
to
make
to
you
make
it
said
nicholl
our
friend
barbicane
believes
that
his
projectile
will
go
straight
to
the
moon
yes
certainly
replied
the
president
and
our
friend
nicholl
is
persuaded
it
will
fall
back
upon
the
earth
i
am
certain
of
it
cried
the
captain
good
said
ardan
i
can
not
pretend
to
make
you
agree
but
i
suggest
this
go
with
me
and
so
see
whether
we
are
stopped
on
our
journey
what
exclaimed
maston
stupefied
the
two
rivals
on
this
sudden
proposal
looked
steadily
at
each
other
barbicane
waited
for
the
captain
answer
nicholl
watched
for
the
decision
of
the
president
well
said
michel
there
is
now
no
fear
of
the
shock
done
cried
barbicane
but
quickly
as
he
pronounced
the
word
he
was
not
before
nicholl
hurrah
bravo
hip
hip
hurrah
cried
michel
giving
a
hand
to
each
of
the
late
adversaries
now
that
it
is
all
settled
my
friends
allow
me
to
treat
you
after
french
fashion
let
us
be
off
to
breakfast
chapter
xxii
the
new
citizen
of
the
united
states
that
same
day
all
america
heard
of
the
affair
of
captain
nicholl
and
president
barbicane
as
well
as
its
singular
from
that
day
forth
michel
ardan
had
not
one
moment
rest
deputations
from
all
corners
of
the
union
harassed
him
without
cessation
or
intermission
he
was
compelled
to
receive
them
all
whether
he
would
or
no
how
many
hands
he
shook
how
many
people
he
was
with
it
is
impossible
to
guess
such
a
triumphal
result
would
have
intoxicated
any
other
man
but
he
managed
to
keep
himself
in
a
state
of
delightful
among
the
deputations
of
all
kinds
which
assailed
him
that
of
the
lunatics
were
careful
not
to
forget
what
they
owed
to
the
future
conqueror
of
the
moon
one
day
certain
of
these
poor
people
so
numerous
in
america
came
to
call
upon
him
and
requested
permission
to
return
with
him
to
their
native
country
singular
hallucination
said
he
to
barbicane
after
having
dismissed
the
deputation
with
promises
to
convey
numbers
of
messages
to
friends
in
the
moon
do
you
believe
in
the
influence
of
the
moon
upon
distempers
scarcely
no
more
do
i
despite
some
remarkable
recorded
facts
of
history
for
instance
during
an
epidemic
in
a
large
number
of
persons
died
at
the
very
moment
of
an
eclipse
the
celebrated
bacon
always
fainted
during
an
eclipse
charles
vi
relapsed
six
times
into
madness
during
the
year
sometimes
during
the
new
sometimes
during
the
full
moon
gall
observed
that
insane
persons
underwent
an
accession
of
their
disorder
twice
in
every
month
at
the
epochs
of
new
and
full
moon
in
fact
numerous
observations
made
upon
fevers
somnambulisms
and
other
human
maladies
seem
to
prove
that
the
moon
does
exercise
some
mysterious
influence
upon
man
but
the
how
and
the
wherefore
asked
barbicane
well
i
can
only
give
you
the
answer
which
arago
borrowed
from
plutarch
which
is
nineteen
centuries
old
the
stories
are
not
true
in
the
height
of
his
triumph
michel
ardan
had
to
encounter
all
the
annoyances
incidental
to
a
man
of
celebrity
managers
of
entertainments
wanted
to
exhibit
him
barnum
offered
him
a
million
dollars
to
make
a
tour
of
the
united
states
in
his
show
as
for
his
photographs
they
were
sold
of
all
size
and
his
portrait
taken
in
every
imaginable
posture
more
than
half
a
million
copies
were
disposed
of
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
but
it
was
not
only
the
men
who
paid
him
homage
but
the
women
as
well
he
might
have
married
well
a
hundred
times
over
if
he
had
been
willing
to
settle
in
life
the
old
maids
in
particular
of
forty
years
and
upward
and
dry
in
proportion
devoured
his
photographs
day
and
night
they
would
have
married
him
by
hundreds
even
if
he
had
imposed
upon
them
the
condition
of
accompanying
him
into
space
he
had
however
no
intention
of
transplanting
a
race
of
upon
the
surface
of
the
moon
he
therefore
declined
all
offers
as
soon
as
he
could
withdraw
from
these
somewhat
embarrassing
demonstrations
he
went
accompanied
by
his
friends
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
columbiad
he
was
highly
gratified
by
his
inspection
and
made
the
descent
to
the
bottom
of
the
tube
of
this
gigantic
machine
which
was
presently
to
launch
him
to
the
regions
of
the
moon
it
is
necessary
here
to
mention
a
proposal
of
maston
when
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
found
that
barbicane
and
nicholl
accepted
the
proposal
of
michel
ardan
he
determined
to
join
them
and
make
one
of
a
smug
party
of
four
so
one
day
he
determined
to
be
admitted
as
one
of
the
travelers
barbicane
pained
at
having
to
refuse
him
gave
him
clearly
to
understand
that
the
projectile
could
not
possibly
contain
so
many
passengers
maston
in
despair
went
in
search
of
michel
ardan
who
counseled
him
to
resign
himself
to
the
situation
adding
one
or
two
arguments
you
see
old
fellow
he
said
you
must
not
take
what
i
say
in
bad
part
but
really
between
ourselves
you
are
in
too
incomplete
a
condition
to
appear
in
the
moon
incomplete
shrieked
the
valiant
invalid
yes
my
dear
fellow
imagine
our
meeting
some
of
the
inhabitants
up
there
would
you
like
to
give
them
such
a
melancholy
notion
of
what
goes
on
down
here
to
teach
them
what
war
is
to
inform
them
that
we
employ
our
time
chiefly
in
devouring
each
other
in
smashing
arms
and
legs
and
that
too
on
a
globe
which
is
capable
of
supporting
a
hundred
billions
of
inhabitants
and
which
actually
does
contain
nearly
two
hundred
millions
why
my
worthy
friend
we
should
have
to
turn
you
out
of
doors
but
still
if
you
arrive
there
in
pieces
you
will
be
as
incomplete
as
i
am
unquestionably
replied
michel
ardan
but
we
shall
not
in
fact
a
preparatory
experiment
tried
on
the
of
october
had
yielded
the
best
results
and
caused
the
most
hopes
of
success
barbicane
desirous
of
obtaining
some
notion
of
the
effect
of
the
shock
at
the
moment
of
the
departure
had
procured
a
mortar
from
the
arsenal
of
pensacola
he
had
this
placed
on
the
bank
of
hillisborough
roads
in
order
that
the
shell
might
fall
back
into
the
sea
and
the
shock
be
thereby
destroyed
his
object
was
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
shock
of
departure
and
not
that
of
the
return
a
hollow
projectile
had
been
prepared
for
this
curious
experiment
a
thick
padding
fastened
upon
a
kind
of
elastic
network
made
of
the
best
steel
lined
the
inside
of
the
walls
it
was
a
veritable
most
carefully
wadded
what
a
pity
i
ca
find
room
in
there
said
maston
regretting
that
his
height
did
not
allow
of
his
trying
the
adventure
within
this
shell
were
shut
up
a
large
cat
and
a
squirrel
belonging
to
maston
and
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
they
were
desirous
however
of
ascertaining
how
this
little
animal
least
of
all
others
subject
to
giddiness
would
endure
this
experimental
voyage
the
mortar
was
charged
with
pounds
of
powder
and
the
shell
placed
in
the
chamber
on
being
fired
the
projectile
rose
with
great
velocity
described
a
majestic
parabola
attained
a
height
of
about
a
thousand
feet
and
with
a
graceful
curve
descended
in
the
midst
of
the
vessels
that
lay
there
at
anchor
without
a
moment
loss
of
time
a
small
boat
put
off
in
the
direction
of
its
fall
some
divers
plunged
into
the
water
and
attached
ropes
to
the
handles
of
the
shell
which
was
quickly
dragged
on
board
five
minutes
did
not
elapse
between
the
moment
of
enclosing
the
animals
and
that
of
unscrewing
the
coverlid
of
their
prison
ardan
barbicane
maston
and
nicholl
were
present
on
board
the
boat
and
assisted
at
the
operation
with
an
interest
which
may
readily
be
comprehended
hardly
had
the
shell
been
opened
when
the
cat
leaped
out
slightly
bruised
but
full
of
life
and
exhibiting
no
signs
whatever
of
having
made
an
aerial
expedition
no
trace
however
of
the
squirrel
could
be
discovered
the
truth
at
last
became
apparent
the
cat
had
eaten
its
maston
grieved
much
for
the
loss
of
his
poor
squirrel
and
proposed
to
add
its
case
to
that
of
other
martyrs
to
science
after
this
experiment
all
hesitation
all
fear
disappeared
besides
barbicane
plans
would
ensure
greater
perfection
for
his
projectile
and
go
far
to
annihilate
altogether
the
effects
of
the
shock
nothing
now
remained
but
to
go
two
days
later
michel
ardan
received
a
message
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
an
honor
of
which
he
showed
himself
especially
sensible
after
the
example
of
his
illustrious
the
marquis
de
la
fayette
the
government
had
decreed
to
him
the
title
of
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
chapter
xxiii
the
on
the
completion
of
the
columbiad
the
public
interest
centered
in
the
projectile
itself
the
vehicle
which
was
destined
to
carry
the
three
hardy
adventurers
into
space
the
new
plans
had
been
sent
to
breadwill
and
of
albany
with
the
request
for
their
speedy
execution
the
projectile
was
consequently
cast
on
the
of
november
and
immediately
forwarded
by
the
eastern
railway
to
stones
hill
which
it
reached
without
accident
on
the
of
that
month
where
michel
ardan
barbicane
and
nicholl
were
waiting
impatiently
for
it
the
projectile
had
now
to
be
filled
to
the
depth
of
three
feet
with
a
bed
of
water
intended
to
support
a
wooden
disc
which
worked
easily
within
the
walls
of
the
projectile
it
was
upon
this
kind
of
raft
that
the
travelers
were
to
take
their
place
this
body
of
water
was
divided
by
horizontal
partitions
which
the
shock
of
the
departure
would
have
to
break
in
succession
then
each
sheet
of
the
water
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
running
off
into
escape
tubes
toward
the
top
of
the
projectile
constituted
a
kind
of
spring
and
the
wooden
disc
supplied
with
extremely
powerful
plugs
could
not
strike
the
lowest
plate
except
after
breaking
successively
the
different
partitions
undoubtedly
the
travelers
would
still
have
to
encounter
a
violent
recoil
after
the
complete
escapement
of
the
water
but
the
first
shock
would
be
almost
entirely
destroyed
by
this
powerful
spring
the
upper
parts
of
the
walls
were
lined
with
a
thick
padding
of
leather
fastened
upon
springs
of
the
best
steel
behind
which
the
escape
tubes
were
completely
concealed
thus
all
imaginable
precautions
had
been
taken
for
averting
the
first
shock
and
if
they
did
get
crushed
they
must
as
michel
ardan
said
be
made
of
very
bad
materials
the
entrance
into
this
metallic
tower
was
by
a
narrow
aperture
contrived
in
the
wall
of
the
cone
this
was
hermetically
closed
by
a
plate
of
aluminum
fastened
internally
by
powerful
the
travelers
could
therefore
quit
their
prison
at
pleasure
as
soon
as
they
should
reach
the
moon
light
and
view
were
given
by
means
of
four
thick
lenticular
glass
scuttles
two
pierced
in
the
circular
wall
itself
the
third
in
the
bottom
the
fourth
in
the
top
these
scuttles
then
were
protected
against
the
shock
of
departure
by
plates
let
into
solid
grooves
which
could
easily
be
opened
outward
by
unscrewing
them
from
the
inside
reservoirs
firmly
fixed
contained
water
and
the
necessary
provisions
and
fire
and
light
were
procurable
by
means
of
gas
contained
in
a
special
reservoir
under
a
pressure
of
several
atmospheres
they
had
only
to
turn
a
tap
and
for
six
hours
the
gas
would
light
and
warm
this
comfortable
vehicle
there
now
remained
only
the
question
of
air
for
allowing
for
the
consumption
of
air
by
barbicane
his
two
companions
and
two
dogs
which
he
proposed
taking
with
him
it
was
necessary
to
renew
the
air
of
the
projectile
now
air
consists
principally
of
parts
of
oxygen
and
of
nitrogen
the
lungs
absorb
the
oxygen
which
is
indispensable
for
the
support
of
life
and
reject
the
nitrogen
the
air
expired
loses
nearly
five
per
cent
of
the
former
and
contains
nearly
an
equal
volume
of
carbonic
acid
produced
by
the
combustion
of
the
elements
of
the
blood
in
an
enclosure
then
after
a
certain
time
all
the
oxygen
of
the
air
will
be
replaced
by
the
carbonic
acid
a
gas
fatal
to
life
there
were
two
things
to
be
done
then
first
to
replace
the
absorbed
oxygen
secondly
to
destroy
the
expired
carbonic
acid
both
easy
enough
to
do
by
means
of
chlorate
of
potassium
and
caustic
potash
the
former
is
a
salt
which
appears
under
the
form
of
white
crystals
when
raised
to
a
temperature
of
degrees
it
is
transformed
into
chlorure
of
potassium
and
the
oxygen
which
it
contains
is
entirely
liberated
now
pounds
of
chlorate
of
potassium
produces
seven
pounds
of
oxygen
or
litres
the
quantity
necessary
for
the
travelers
during
hours
caustic
potash
has
a
great
affinity
for
carbonic
acid
and
it
is
sufficient
to
shake
it
in
order
for
it
to
seize
upon
the
acid
and
form
bicarbonate
of
potassium
by
these
two
means
they
would
be
enabled
to
restore
to
the
vitiated
air
its
supporting
properties
it
is
necessary
however
to
add
that
the
experiments
had
hitherto
been
made
anima
whatever
its
scientific
accuracy
was
they
were
at
present
ignorant
how
it
would
answer
with
human
beings
the
honor
of
putting
it
to
the
proof
was
energetically
claimed
by
maston
since
i
am
not
to
go
said
the
brave
artillerist
i
may
at
least
live
for
a
week
in
the
projectile
it
would
have
been
hard
to
refuse
him
so
they
consented
to
his
wish
a
sufficient
quantity
of
chlorate
of
potassium
and
of
caustic
potash
was
placed
at
his
disposal
together
with
provisions
for
eight
days
and
having
shaken
hands
with
his
friends
on
the
of
november
at
six
after
strictly
informing
them
not
to
open
his
prison
before
the
at
six
he
slid
down
the
projectile
the
plate
of
which
was
at
once
hermetically
sealed
what
did
he
do
with
himself
during
that
week
they
could
get
no
information
the
thickness
of
the
walls
of
the
projectile
prevented
any
sound
reaching
from
the
inside
to
the
outside
on
the
of
november
at
six
exactly
the
plate
was
opened
the
friends
of
maston
had
been
all
along
in
a
state
of
much
anxiety
but
they
were
promptly
reassured
on
hearing
a
jolly
voice
shouting
a
boisterous
hurrah
presently
afterward
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
cone
in
a
triumphant
attitude
he
had
grown
fat
chapter
xxiv
the
telescope
of
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
of
october
in
the
preceding
year
after
the
close
of
the
subscription
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
credited
the
observatory
of
cambridge
with
the
necessary
sums
for
the
construction
of
a
gigantic
optical
instrument
this
instrument
was
designed
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
visible
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
any
object
exceeding
nine
feet
in
diameter
at
the
period
when
the
gun
club
essayed
their
great
experiment
such
instruments
had
reached
a
high
degree
of
perfection
and
produced
some
magnificent
results
two
telescopes
in
particular
at
this
time
were
possessed
of
remarkable
power
and
of
gigantic
dimensions
the
first
constructed
by
herschel
was
feet
in
length
and
had
an
of
four
feet

inches
it
possessed
a
magnifying
power
of

raised
in

and

to
lord
rosse
the
length
of
this
tube
is
feet
and
the
diameter
of
its
six
feet
it
magnifies
times
and
required
an
immense
erection
of
brick
work
and
masonry
for
the
purpose
of
working
it
its
weight
being
twelve
and
a
half
tons
still
despite
these
colossal
dimensions
the
actual
enlargements
scarcely
exceeded
times
in
round
numbers
consequently
the
moon
was
brought
within
no
nearer
an
apparent
distance
than
miles
and
objects
of
less
than
sixty
feet
in
diameter
unless
they
were
of
very
considerable
length
were
still
imperceptible
in
the
present
case
dealing
with
a
projectile
nine
feet
in
diameter
and
fifteen
feet
long
it
became
necessary
to
bring
the
moon
within
an
apparent
distance
of
five
miles
at
most
and
for
that
purpose
to
establish
a
magnifying
power
of
times
such
was
the
question
proposed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
there
was
no
lack
of
funds
the
difficulty
was
purely
one
of
construction
after
considerable
discussion
as
to
the
best
form
and
principle
of
the
proposed
instrument
the
work
was
finally
commenced
according
to
the
calculations
of
the
observatory
of
cambridge
the
tube
of
the
new
reflector
would
require
to
be
feet
in
length
and
the
sixteen
feet
in
diameter
colossal
as
these
dimensions
may
appear
they
were
diminutive
in
comparison
with
the
foot
telescope
proposed
by
the
astronomer
hooke
only
a
few
years
ago
regarding
the
choice
of
locality
that
matter
was
promptly
determined
the
object
was
to
select
some
lofty
mountain
and
there
are
not
many
of
these
in
the
united
states
in
fact
there
are
but
two
chains
of
moderate
elevation
between
which
runs
the
magnificent
mississippi
the
king
of
rivers
as
these
republican
yankees
delight
to
call
it
eastwards
rise
the
appalachians
the
very
highest
point
of
which
in
new
hampshire
does
not
exceed
the
very
moderate
altitude
of
feet
on
the
west
however
rise
the
rocky
mountains
that
immense
range
which
commencing
at
the
straights
of
magellan
follows
the
western
coast
of
southern
america
under
the
name
of
the
andes
or
the
cordilleras
until
it
crosses
the
isthmus
of
panama
and
runs
up
the
whole
of
north
america
to
the
very
borders
of
the
polar
sea
the
highest
elevation
of
this
range
still
does
not
exceed
feet
with
this
elevation
nevertheless
the
gun
club
were
compelled
to
be
content
inasmuch
as
they
had
determined
that
both
telescope
and
columbiad
should
be
erected
within
the
limits
of
the
union
all
the
necessary
apparatus
was
consequently
sent
on
to
the
summit
of
long
peak
in
the
territory
of
missouri
neither
pen
nor
language
can
describe
the
difficulties
of
all
kinds
which
the
american
engineers
had
to
surmount
of
the
prodigies
of
daring
and
skill
which
they
accomplished
they
had
to
raise
enormous
stones
massive
pieces
of
wrought
iron
heavy
and
huge
portions
of
cylinder
with
an
weighing
nearly
pounds
above
the
line
of
perpetual
snow
for
more
than
feet
in
height
after
crossing
desert
prairies
impenetrable
forests
fearful
rapids
far
from
all
centers
of
population
and
in
the
midst
of
savage
regions
in
which
every
detail
of
life
becomes
an
almost
insoluble
problem
and
yet
notwithstanding
these
innumerable
obstacles
american
genius
triumphed
in
less
than
a
year
after
the
commencement
of
the
works
toward
the
close
of
september
the
gigantic
reflector
rose
into
the
air
to
a
height
of
feet
it
was
raised
by
means
of
an
enormous
iron
crane
an
ingenious
mechanism
allowed
it
to
be
easily
worked
toward
all
the
points
of
the
heavens
and
to
follow
the
stars
from
the
one
horizon
to
the
other
during
their
journey
through
the
heavens
it
had
cost
the
first
time
it
was
directed
toward
the
moon
the
observers
evinced
both
curiosity
and
anxiety
what
were
they
about
to
discover
in
the
field
of
this
telescope
which
magnified
objects
times
would
they
perceive
peoples
herds
of
lunar
animals
towns
lakes
seas
no
there
was
nothing
which
science
had
not
already
discovered
and
on
all
the
points
of
its
disc
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
moon
became
determinable
with
the
utmost
precision
but
the
telescope
of
the
rocky
mountains
before
doing
its
duty
to
the
gun
club
rendered
immense
services
to
astronomy
thanks
to
its
penetrative
power
the
depths
of
the
heavens
were
sounded
to
the
utmost
extent
the
apparent
diameter
of
a
great
number
of
stars
was
accurately
measured
and
clark
of
the
cambridge
staff
resolved
the
crab
nebula
in
taurus
which
the
reflector
of
lord
rosse
had
never
been
able
to
decompose
chapter

final
details
it
was
the
of
november
the
departure
was
to
take
place
in
ten
days
one
operation
alone
remained
to
be
accomplished
to
bring
all
to
a
happy
termination
an
operation
delicate
and
perilous
requiring
infinite
precautions
and
against
the
success
of
which
captain
nicholl
had
laid
his
third
bet
it
was
in
fact
nothing
less
than
the
loading
of
the
columbiad
and
the
introduction
into
it
of
pounds
of
nicholl
had
thought
not
perhaps
without
reason
that
the
handling
of
such
formidable
quantities
of
pyroxyle
would
in
all
probability
involve
a
grave
catastrophe
and
at
any
rate
that
this
immense
mass
of
eminently
inflammable
matter
would
inevitably
ignite
when
submitted
to
the
pressure
of
the
projectile
there
were
indeed
dangers
accruing
as
before
from
the
carelessness
of
the
americans
but
barbicane
had
set
his
heart
on
success
and
took
all
possible
precautions
in
the
first
place
he
was
very
careful
as
to
the
transportation
of
the
to
stones
hill
he
had
it
conveyed
in
small
quantities
carefully
packed
in
sealed
cases
these
were
brought
by
rail
from
tampa
town
to
the
camp
and
from
thence
were
taken
to
the
columbiad
by
barefooted
workmen
who
deposited
them
in
their
places
by
means
of
cranes
placed
at
the
orifice
of
the
cannon
no
was
permitted
to
work
and
every
fire
was
extinguished
within
two
miles
of
the
works
even
in
november
they
feared
to
work
by
day
lest
the
sun
rays
acting
on
the
might
lead
to
unhappy
results
this
led
to
their
working
at
night
by
light
produced
in
a
vacuum
by
means
of
ruhmkorff
apparatus
which
threw
an
artificial
brightness
into
the
depths
of
the
columbiad
there
the
cartridges
were
arranged
with
the
utmost
regularity
connected
by
a
metallic
thread
destined
to
communicate
to
them
all
simultaneously
the
electric
spark
by
which
means
this
mass
of
was
eventually
to
be
ignited
by
the
of
november
eight
hundred
cartridges
had
been
placed
in
the
bottom
of
the
columbiad
so
far
the
operation
had
been
successful
but
what
confusion
what
anxieties
what
struggles
were
undergone
by
president
barbicane
in
vain
had
he
refused
admission
to
stones
hill
every
day
the
inquisitive
neighbors
scaled
the
palisades
some
even
carrying
their
imprudence
to
the
point
of
smoking
while
surrounded
by
bales
of
barbicane
was
in
a
perpetual
state
of
alarm
maston
seconded
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
by
giving
vigorous
chase
to
the
intruders
and
carefully
picking
up
the
still
lighted
cigar
ends
which
the
yankees
threw
about
a
somewhat
difficult
task
seeing
that
more
than
persons
were
gathered
round
the
enclosure
michel
ardan
had
volunteered
to
superintend
the
transport
of
the
cartridges
to
the
mouth
of
the
columbiad
but
the
president
having
surprised
him
with
an
enormous
cigar
in
his
mouth
while
he
was
hunting
out
the
rash
spectators
to
whom
he
himself
offered
so
dangerous
an
example
saw
that
he
could
not
trust
this
fearless
smoker
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
mount
a
special
guard
over
him
at
last
providence
being
propitious
this
wonderful
loading
came
to
a
happy
termination
captain
nicholl
third
bet
being
thus
lost
it
remained
now
to
introduce
the
projectile
into
the
columbiad
and
to
place
it
on
its
soft
bed
of
but
before
doing
this
all
those
things
necessary
for
the
journey
had
to
be
carefully
arranged
in
the
projectile
vehicle
these
necessaries
were
numerous
and
had
ardan
been
allowed
to
follow
his
own
wishes
there
would
have
been
no
space
remaining
for
the
travelers
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
half
the
things
this
charming
frenchman
wished
to
convey
to
the
moon
a
veritable
stock
of
useless
trifles
but
barbicane
interfered
and
refused
admission
to
anything
not
absolutely
needed
several
thermometers
barometers
and
telescopes
were
packed
in
the
instrument
case
the
travelers
being
desirous
of
examing
the
moon
carefully
during
their
voyage
in
order
to
facilitate
their
studies
they
took
with
them
boeer
and
moeller
excellent
a
masterpiece
of
patience
and
observation
which
they
hoped
would
enable
them
to
identify
those
physical
features
in
the
moon
with
which
they
were
acquainted
this
map
reproduced
with
scrupulous
fidelity
the
smallest
details
of
the
lunar
surface
which
faces
the
earth
the
mountains
valleys
craters
peaks
and
ridges
were
all
represented
with
their
exact
dimensions
relative
positions
and
names
from
the
mountains
doerfel
and
leibnitz
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
disc
to
the
of
the
north
pole
they
took
also
three
rifles
and
three
and
a
large
quantity
of
balls
shot
and
powder
we
can
not
tell
whom
we
shall
have
to
deal
with
said
michel
ardan
men
or
beasts
may
possibly
object
to
our
visit
it
is
only
wise
to
take
all
precautions
these
defensive
weapons
were
accompanied
by
pickaxes
crowbars
saws
and
other
useful
implements
not
to
mention
clothing
adapted
to
every
temperature
from
that
of
polar
regions
to
that
of
the
torrid
zone
ardan
wished
to
convey
a
number
of
animals
of
different
sorts
not
indeed
a
pair
of
every
known
species
as
he
could
not
see
the
necessity
of
acclimatizing
serpents
tigers
alligators
or
any
other
noxious
beasts
in
the
moon
nevertheless
he
said
to
barbicane
some
valuable
and
useful
beasts
bullocks
cows
horses
and
donkeys
would
bear
the
journey
very
well
and
would
also
be
very
useful
to
us
i
dare
say
my
dear
ardan
replied
the
president
but
our
is
no
noah
ark
from
which
it
differs
both
in
dimensions
and
object
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
possibilities
after
a
prolonged
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
the
travelers
should
restrict
themselves
to
a
belonging
to
nicholl
and
to
a
large
newfoundland
several
packets
of
seeds
were
also
included
among
the
necessaries
michel
ardan
indeed
was
anxious
to
add
some
sacks
full
of
earth
to
sow
them
in
as
it
was
he
took
a
dozen
shrubs
carefully
wrapped
up
in
straw
to
plant
in
the
moon
the
important
question
of
provisions
still
remained
it
being
necessary
to
provide
against
the
possibility
of
their
finding
the
moon
absolutely
barren
barbicane
managed
so
successfully
that
he
supplied
them
with
sufficient
rations
for
a
year
these
consisted
of
preserved
meats
and
vegetables
reduced
by
strong
hydraulic
pressure
to
the
smallest
possible
dimensions
they
were
also
supplied
with
brandy
and
took
water
enough
for
two
months
being
confident
from
astronomical
observations
that
there
was
no
lack
of
water
on
the
moon
surface
as
to
provisions
doubtless
the
inhabitants
of
the
would
find
nourishment
somewhere
in
the
ardan
never
questioned
this
indeed
had
he
done
so
he
would
never
have
undertaken
the
journey
besides
he
said
one
day
to
his
friends
we
shall
not
be
completely
abandoned
by
our
terrestrial
friends
they
will
take
care
not
to
forget
us
no
indeed
replied
maston
nothing
would
be
simpler
replied
ardan
the
columbiad
will
be
always
there
well
whenever
the
moon
is
in
a
favorable
condition
as
to
the
zenith
if
not
to
the
perigee
that
is
to
say
about
once
a
year
could
you
not
send
us
a
shell
packed
with
provisions
which
we
might
expect
on
some
appointed
day
hurrah
hurrah
cried
matson
what
an
ingenious
fellow
what
a
splendid
idea
indeed
my
good
friends
we
shall
not
forget
you
i
shall
reckon
upon
you
then
you
see
we
shall
receive
news
regularly
from
the
earth
and
we
shall
indeed
be
stupid
if
we
hit
upon
no
plan
for
communicating
with
our
good
friends
here
these
words
inspired
such
confidence
that
michel
ardan
carried
all
the
gun
club
with
him
in
his
enthusiasm
what
he
said
seemed
so
simple
and
so
easy
so
sure
of
success
that
none
could
be
so
sordidly
attached
to
this
earth
as
to
hesitate
to
follow
the
three
travelers
on
their
lunar
expedition
all
being
ready
at
last
it
remained
to
place
the
projectile
in
the
columbiad
an
operation
abundantly
accompanied
by
dangers
and
difficulties
the
enormous
shell
was
conveyed
to
the
summit
of
stones
hill
there
powerful
cranes
raised
it
and
held
it
suspended
over
the
mouth
of
the
cylinder
it
was
a
fearful
moment
what
if
the
chains
should
break
under
its
enormous
weight
the
sudden
fall
of
such
a
body
would
inevitably
cause
the
to
explode
fortunately
this
did
not
happen
and
some
hours
later
the
descended
gently
into
the
heart
of
the
cannon
and
rested
on
its
couch
of
pyroxyle
a
veritable
bed
of
explosive
its
pressure
had
no
result
other
than
the
more
effectual
ramming
down
of
the
charge
in
the
columbiad
i
have
lost
said
the
captain
who
forthwith
paid
president
barbicane
the
sum
of
three
thousand
dollars
barbicane
did
not
wish
to
accept
the
money
from
one
of
his
but
gave
way
at
last
before
the
determination
of
nicholl
who
wished
before
leaving
the
earth
to
fulfill
all
his
engagements
now
said
michel
ardan
i
have
only
one
thing
more
to
wish
for
you
my
brave
captain
what
is
that
asked
nicholl
it
is
that
you
may
lose
your
two
other
bets
then
we
shall
be
sure
not
to
be
stopped
on
our
journey

the

the

bathed
in

that

which
three
of

about

how
many

lost

beat
with
disquietude

thronged
the

another
cocktail
real
in
the
new

all
these
cries
intermingled
produced
a
bewildering
and
deafening
hubbub
but
on
this
day
of
december
such
sounds
were
rare
no
one
thought
of
eating
or
drinking
and
at
four
there
were
vast
numbers
of
spectators
who
had
not
even
taken
their
customary
lunch
and
a
still
more
significant
fact
even
the
national
passion
for
play
seemed
quelled
for
the
time
under
the
general
excitement
of
the
hour
up
till
nightfall
a
dull
noiseless
agitation
such
as
precedes
great
catastrophes
ran
through
the
anxious
multitude
an
indescribable
uneasiness
pervaded
all
minds
an
indefinable
sensation
which
oppressed
the
heart
every
one
wished
it
was
over
however
about
seven
the
heavy
silence
was
dissipated
the
moon
rose
above
the
horizon
millions
of
hurrahs
hailed
her
appearance
she
was
punctual
to
the
rendezvous
and
shouts
of
welcome
greeted
her
on
all
sides
as
her
pale
beams
shone
gracefully
in
the
clear
heavens
at
this
moment
the
three
intrepid
travelers
appeared
this
was
the
signal
for
renewed
cries
of
still
greater
intensity
instantly
the
vast
assemblage
as
with
one
accord
struck
up
the
national
hymn
of
the
united

sung
by
five
million
of
hearty
throats
rose
like
a
roaring
tempest
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
atmosphere
then
a
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
crowd
the
frenchman
and
the
two
americans
had
by
this
time
entered
the
enclosure
reserved
in
the
center
of
the
multitude
they
were
accompanied
by
the
members
of
the

the

had
arrived
for
taking
their

in
the

the

for
the
descent
and
the
subsequent
removal
of
the
cranes
and
scaffolding
that
inclined
over
the

required
a

period

had
regulated

of

who
was
charged
with
the
duty
of
firing
the

by
means
of
an
electric

thus
the
travelers
enclosed
within
the
projectile
were
enabled
to
follow
with
their
eyes
the
impassive
needle
which
marked
the
precise
moment
of
their
departure
the
moment
had
arrived
for
saying
the
scene
was
a
touching
one
despite
his
feverish
gayety
even
michel

was
touched
maston
had
found
in
his
own
dry

one
ancient

which
he
had
doubtless
reserved
for
the
occasion
he
dropped

replied
barbicane
a
few
moments
later
the
three
had
ensconced
themselves
in
the
projectile
and
screwed
down
the
plate
which
covered
the
the
mouth
of
the
columbiad
now
completely
disencumbered

open
entirely
to

the

advanced
upward
in
a
heaven
of
the
purest
clearness
outshining
in
her
passage
the
twinkling
light
of
the
stars
she
passed
over
the
constellation
of
the
twins
and
was
now
nearing
the
halfway
point
between
the
horizon
and
the
zenith
a
terrible
silence
weighed
upon
the
entire
scene
not
a
breath
of
wind
upon
the
earth
not
a
sound
of
breathing
from
the
countless
chests
of
the
spectators
their
hearts
seemed
afraid
to
beat
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
yawning
mouth
of
the
columbiad
murchison
followed
with
his
eye
the
hand
of
his
chronometer
it
wanted
scarce
forty
seconds
to
the
moment
of
departure
but
each
second
seemed
to
last
an
age
at
the
twentieth
there
was
a
general
shudder
as
it
occurred
to
the
minds
of
that
vast
assemblage
that
the
bold
travelers
shut
up
within
the
projectile
were
also
counting
those
terrible
seconds
some

cries
here
and
there
escaped
the

murchison
pressed
with

the

restored
the
current
of
the

and
discharged
the
spark
into
the
breech
of
the

an
appalling
unearthly
report
followed
instantly
such
as
can
be
compared
to
nothing
whatever
known
not
even
to
the
roar
of
thunder
or
the
blast
of

can
convey
the

idea
of
the

sound
an
immense
spout
of

shot
up
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
as
from

crater
the
earth
heaved
up
and
with
great
difficulty
some

obtained

lit
up

for

superseded

over

of

this

was
perceived
at

entered
in

the

stupefied
as
soon
as
the

were
over
the

the

woke
up
with
frenzied

rose
to
the

thousands
of

in

armed
with

and
were
questioning

forgetting
all
contusions
and
emotions
in
the
one
idea
of
watching
for
the
projectile
they
looked
in
vain
it
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
and
they
were
obliged
to
wait
for
telegrams
from
long
peak
the
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
was
at
his
post
on
the
rocky
mountains
and
to
him
as
a
skillful
and
persevering
astronomer
all
observations
had
been
confided
but
an
unforeseen
phenomenon
came
in
to
subject
the
public
impatience
to
a
severe
trial
the
weather
hitherto
so
fine
suddenly
changed
the
sky
became
heavy
with
clouds
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
after
the
terrible
derangement
of
the
atmospheric
strata
and
the
dispersion
of
the
enormous
quantity
of
vapor
arising
from
the
combustion
of
pounds
of
pyroxyle
on
the
morrow
the
horizon
was
covered
with
clouds
a
thick
and
impenetrable
curtain
between
earth
and
sky
which
unhappily
extended
as
far
as
the
rocky
mountains
it
was
a
fatality
but
since
man
had
chosen
so
to
disturb
the
atmosphere
he
was
bound
to
accept
the
consequences
of
his
experiment
supposing
now
that
the
experiment
had
succeeded
the
travelers
having
started
on
the
of
december
at
were
due
on
the
at
at
their
destination
so
that
up
to
that
time
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
after
all
to
have
observed
under
such
conditions
a
body
so
small
as
the
shell
therefore
they
waited
with
what
patience
they
might
from
the
to
the
of
december
inclusive
the
weather
remaining
much
the
same
in
america
the
great
european
instruments
of
herschel
rosse
and
foucault
were
constantly
directed
toward
the
moon
for
the
weather
was
then
magnificent
but
the
comparative
weakness
of
their
glasses
prevented
any
trustworthy
observations
being
made
on
the
the
sky
seemed
to
lighten
they
were
in
hopes
now
but
their
hope
was
of
but
short
duration
and
at
night
again
thick
clouds
hid
the
starry
vault
from
all
eyes
matters
were
now
becoming
serious
when
on
the
the
sun
reappeared
for
an
instant
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
teasing
the
americans
it
was
received
with
hisses
and
wounded
no
doubt
by
such
a
reception
showed
itself
very
sparing
of
its
rays
on
the
no
change
maston
went
nearly
mad
and
great
fears
were
entertained
regarding
the
brain
of
this
worthy
individual
which
had
hitherto
been
so
well
preserved
within
his
cranium
but
on
the
one
of
those
inexplicable
tempests
peculiar
to
those
intertropical
regions
was
let
loose
in
the
atmosphere
a
terrific
east
wind
swept
away
the
groups
of
clouds
which
had
been
so
long
gathering
and
at
night
the
of

rode
majestically

a

star
that
very
night
the
startling
news
so
impatiently
awaited
burst
like
a
thunderbolt
over
the
united
states
of
the
union
and
thence
darting
across
the
ocean
ran
through
all
the
telegraphic
wires
of
the
globe
the
projectile
had
been
detected
thanks
to
the
gigantic
reflector
of
long
peak
here
is
the
note
received
by
the
director
of
the
observatory
of
cambridge
it
contains
the
scientific
conclusion
regarding
this
great
experiment
of
the
gun
club
long
peak
december
to
the
officers
of
the
observatory
of
cambridge
the
projectile
discharged
by
the
columbiad
at
stones
hill
has
been
detected
by
belfast
and
maston
of
december
at
the
moon
having
entered
her
last
quarter
this
projectile
has
not
arrived
at
its
destination
it
has
passed
by
the
side
but
sufficiently
near
to
be
retained
by
the
lunar
attraction
the
rectilinear
movement
has
thus
become
changed
into
a
circular
motion
of
extreme
velocity
and
it
is
now
pursuing
an
elliptical
orbit
round
the
moon
of
which
it
has
become
a
true
satellite
the
elements
of
this
new
star
we
have
as
yet
been
unable
to
determine
we
do
not
yet
know
the
velocity
of
its
passage
the
distance
which
separates
it
from
the
surface
of
the
moon
may
be
estimated
at
about
miles
however
two
hypotheses
come
here
into
our
consideration
either
the
attraction
of
the
moon
will
end
by
drawing
them
into
itself
and
the
travelers
will
attain
their
destination
or
the
projectile
following
an
immutable
law
will
continue
to
gravitate
round
the
moon
till
the
end
of
time
at
some
future
time
our
observations
will
be
able
to
determine
this
point
but
till
then
the
experiment
of
the
gun
club
can
have
no
other
result
than
to
have
provided
our
solar
system
with
a
new
star
belfast
to
how
many
questions
did
this
unexpected
give
rise
what
mysterious
results
was
the
future
reserving
for
the
investigation
of
science
at
all
events
the
names
of
nicholl
barbicane
and
michel
ardan
were
certain
to
be
immortalized
in
the
annals
of
astronomy
when
the
dispatch
from
long
peak
had
once
become
known
there
was
but
one
universal
feeling
of
surprise
and
alarm
was
it
possible
to
go
to
the
aid
of
these
bold
travelers
no
for
they
had
placed
themselves
beyond
the
pale
of
humanity
by
crossing
the
limits
imposed
by
the
creator
on
his
earthly
creatures
they
had
air
enough
for
months
they
had
victuals
enough
for
but
after
that
there
was
only
one
man
who
would
not
admit
that
the
situation
was
desperate
he
alone
had
confidence
and
that
was
their
devoted
friend
maston
besides
he
never
let
them
get
out
of
sight
his
home
was
henceforth
the
post
at
long
peak
his
horizon
the
mirror
of
that
immense
reflector
as
soon
as
the
moon
rose
above
the
horizon
he
immediately
caught
her
in
the
field
of
the
telescope
he
never
let
her
go
for
an
instant
out
of
his
sight
and
followed
her
assiduously
in
her
course
through
the
stellar
spaces
he
watched
with
untiring
patience
the
passage
of
the
projectile
across
her
silvery
disc
and
really
the
worthy
man
remained
in
perpetual
communication
with
his
three
friends
whom
he
did
not
despair
of
seeing
again
some
day
those
three
men
said
he
have
carried
into
space
all
the
resources
of
art
science
and
industry
with
that
one
can
do
anything
and
you
will
see
that
some
day
they
will
come
out
all
right
round
the
moon

preliminary
chapter
the
first
part
of
this
work
and
serving
as
a
preface
to
the
second
during
the
year
the
whole
world
was
greatly
excited
by
a
scientific
experiment
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
science
the
members
of
the
gun
club
a
circle
of
artillerymen
formed
at
baltimore
after
the
american
war
conceived
the
idea
of
putting
themselves
in
communication
with
the
moon
yes
with
the
moon
by
sending
to
her
a
projectile
their
president
barbicane
the
promoter
of
the
enterprise
having
consulted
the
astronomers
of
the
cambridge
observatory
upon
the
subject
took
all
necessary
means
to
ensure
the
success
of
this
extraordinary
enterprise
which
had
been
declared
practicable
by
the
majority
of
competent
judges
after
setting
on
foot
a
public
subscription
which
realized
nearly
they
began
the
gigantic
work
according
to
the
advice
forwarded
from
the
members
of
the
observatory
the
gun
destined
to
launch
the
projectile
had
to
be
fixed
in
a
country
situated
between
the
and
degrees
of
north
or
south
latitude
in
order
to
aim
at
the
moon
when
at
the
zenith
and
its
initiatory
velocity
was
fixed
at
twelve
thousand
yards
to
the
second
launched
on
the
of
december
at
it
ought
to
reach
the
moon
four
days
after
its
departure
that
is
on
the
of
december
at
midnight
precisely
at
the
moment
of
her
attaining
her
perigee
that
is
her
nearest
distance
from
the
earth
which
is
exactly
leagues
french
or
miles
mean
distance
english
the
principal
members
of
the
gun
club
president
barbicane
major
elphinstone
the
secretary
joseph
maston
and
other
learned
men
held
several
meetings
at
which
the
shape
and
composition
of
the
projectile
were
discussed
also
the
position
and
nature
of
the
gun
and
the
quality
and
quantity
of
powder
to
be
used
it
was
decided
first
that
the
projectile
should
be
a
shell
made
of
aluminum
with
a
diameter
of
inches
and
a
thickness
of
twelve
inches
to
its
walls
and
should
weigh
pounds
second
that
the
gun
should
be
a
columbiad
cast
in
iron
feet
long
and
run
perpendicularly
into
the
earth
third
that
the
charge
should
contain
pounds
of
which
giving
out
six
billions
of
litres
of
gas
in
rear
of
the
projectile
would
easily
carry
it
toward
the
orb
of
night
these
questions
determined
president
barbicane
assisted
by
murchison
the
engineer
to
choose
a
spot
situated
in
florida
in
north
latitude
and
west
greenwich
longitude
it
was
on
this
spot
after
stupendous
labor
that
the
columbiad
was
cast
with
full
success
things
stood
thus
when
an
incident
took
place
which
increased
the
interest
attached
to
this
great
enterprise
a
hundredfold
a
frenchman
an
enthusiastic
parisian
as
witty
as
he
was
bold
asked
to
be
enclosed
in
the
projectile
in
order
that
he
might
reach
the
moon
and
reconnoiter
this
terrestrial
satellite
the
name
of
this
intrepid
adventurer
was
michel
ardan
he
landed
in
america
was
received
with
enthusiasm
held
meetings
saw
himself
carried
in
triumph
reconciled
president
barbicane
to
his
mortal
enemy
captain
nicholl
and
as
a
token
of
reconciliation
persuaded
them
both
to
start
with
him
in
the
projectile
the
proposition
being
accepted
the
shape
of
the
projectile
was
slightly
altered
it
was
made
of
a
form
this
species
of
aerial
car
was
lined
with
strong
springs
and
partitions
to
deaden
the
shock
of
departure
it
was
provided
with
food
for
a
year
water
for
some
months
and
gas
for
some
days
a
apparatus
supplied
the
three
travelers
with
air
to
breathe
at
the
same
time
on
one
of
the
highest
points
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
gun
club
had
a
gigantic
telescope
erected
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
follow
the
course
of
the
projectile
through
space
all
was
then
ready
on
the
of
november
at
the
hour
fixed
upon
from
the
midst
of
an
extraordinary
crowd
of
spectators
the
departure
took
place
and
for
the
first
time
three
human
beings
quitted
the
terrestrial
globe
and
launched
into
space
with
almost
a
certainty
of
reaching
their
destination
these
bold
travelers
michel
ardan
president
barbicane
and
captain
nicholl
ought
to
make
the
passage
in
hours
thirteen
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
consequently
their
arrival
on
the
lunar
disc
could
not
take
place
until
the
of
december
at
twelve
at
night
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
moon
should
be
full
and
not
on
the
as
some
badly
informed
journalists
had
announced
but
an
unforeseen
circumstance
the
detonation
produced
by
the
columbiad
had
the
immediate
effect
of
troubling
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
by
accumulating
a
large
quantity
of
vapor
a
phenomenon
which
excited
universal
indignation
for
the
moon
was
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
the
watchers
for
several
nights
the
worthy
joseph
maston
the
staunchest
friend
of
the
three
travelers
started
for
the
rocky
mountains
accompanied
by
the
hon
belfast
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
and
reached
the
station
of
long
peak
where
the
telescope
was
erected
which
brought
the
moon
within
an
apparent
distance
of
two
leagues
the
honorable
secretary
of
the
gun
club
wished
himself
to
observe
the
vehicle
of
his
daring
friends
the
accumulation
of
the
clouds
in
the
atmosphere
prevented
all
observation
on
the
and
of
december
indeed
it
was
thought
that
all
observations
would
have
to
be
put
off
to
the
of
january
in
the
following
year
for
the
moon
entering
its
last
quarter
on
the
would
then
only
present
an
portion
of
her
disc
insufficient
to
allow
of
their
following
the
course
of
the
projectile
at
length
to
the
general
satisfaction
a
heavy
storm
cleared
the
atmosphere
on
the
night
of
the
and
of
december
and
the
moon
with
disc
was
plainly
to
be
seen
upon
the
black
sky
that
very
night
a
telegram
was
sent
from
the
station
of
peak
by
joseph
maston
and
belfast
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
cambridge
observatory
announcing
that
on
the
of
december
at
the
projectile
launched
by
the
columbiad
of
stones
hill
had
been
detected
by
belfast
and
maston
that
it
had
deviated
from
its
course
from
some
unknown
cause
and
had
not
reached
its
destination
but
that
it
had
passed
near
enough
to
be
retained
by
the
lunar
attraction
that
its
rectilinear
movement
had
been
changed
to
a
circular
one
and
that
following
an
elliptical
orbit
round
the
star
of
night
it
had
become
its
satellite
the
telegram
added
that
the
elements
of
this
new
star
had
not
yet
been
calculated
and
indeed
three
observations
made
upon
a
star
in
three
different
positions
are
necessary
to
determine
these
elements
then
it
showed
that
the
distance
separating
the
projectile
from
the
lunar
surface
might
be
reckoned
at
about
miles
it
ended
with
the
double
hypothesis
either
the
attraction
of
the
moon
would
draw
it
to
herself
and
the
travelers
thus
attain
their
end
or
that
the
projectile
held
in
one
immutable
orbit
would
gravitate
around
the
lunar
disc
to
all
eternity
with
such
alternatives
what
would
be
the
fate
of
the
travelers
certainly
they
had
food
for
some
time
but
supposing
they
did
succeed
in
their
rash
enterprise
how
would
they
return
could
they
ever
return
should
they
hear
from
them
these
questions
debated
by
the
most
learned
pens
of
the
day
strongly
engrossed
the
public
attention
it
is
advisable
here
to
make
a
remark
which
ought
to
be
well
considered
by
hasty
observers
when
a
purely
speculative
discovery
is
announced
to
the
public
it
can
not
be
done
with
too
much
prudence
no
one
is
obliged
to
discover
either
a
planet
a
comet
or
a
satellite
and
whoever
makes
a
mistake
in
such
a
case
exposes
himself
justly
to
the
derision
of
the
mass
far
better
is
it
to
wait
and
that
is
what
the
impatient
joseph
maston
should
have
done
before
sending
this
telegram
forth
to
the
world
which
according
to
his
idea
told
the
whole
result
of
the
enterprise
indeed
this
telegram
contained
two
sorts
of
errors
as
was
proved
eventually
first
errors
of
observation
concerning
the
distance
of
the
projectile
from
the
surface
of
the
moon
for
on
the
of
december
it
was
impossible
to
see
it
and
what
joseph
maston
had
seen
or
thought
he
saw
could
not
have
been
the
projectile
of
the
columbiad
second
errors
of
theory
on
the
fate
in
store
for
the
said
projectile
for
in
making
it
a
satellite
of
the
moon
it
was
putting
it
in
direct
contradiction
of
all
mechanical
laws
one
single
hypothesis
of
the
observers
of
long
peak
could
ever
be
realized
that
which
foresaw
the
case
of
the
travelers
if
still
alive
uniting
their
efforts
with
the
lunar
attraction
to
attain
the
surface
of
the
disc
now
these
men
as
clever
as
they
were
daring
had
survived
the
terrible
shock
consequent
on
their
departure
and
it
is
their
journey
in
the
projectile
car
which
is
here
related
in
its
most
dramatic
as
well
as
in
its
most
singular
details
this
recital
will
destroy
many
illusions
and
surmises
but
it
will
give
a
true
idea
of
the
singular
changes
in
store
for
such
an
enterprise
it
will
bring
out
the
scientific
instincts
of
barbicane
the
industrious
resources
of
nicholl
and
the
audacious
humor
of
michel
ardan
besides
this
it
will
prove
that
their
worthy
friend
joseph
maston
was
wasting
his
time
while
leaning
over
the
gigantic
telescope
he
watched
the
course
of
the
moon
through
the
starry
space
chapter
i
twenty
minutes
past
ten
to
minutes
past
ten
as
ten
struck
michel
ardan
barbicane
and
nicholl
took
leave
of
the
numerous
friends
they
were
leaving
on
the
earth
the
two
dogs
destined
to
propagate
the
canine
race
on
the
lunar
continents
were
already
shut
up
in
the
projectile
the
three
travelers
approached
the
orifice
of
the
enormous
tube
and
a
crane
let
them
down
to
the
conical
top
of
the
projectile
there
an
opening
made
for
the
purpose
gave
them
access
to
the
aluminum
car
the
tackle
belonging
to
the
crane
being
hauled
from
outside
the
mouth
of
the
columbiad
was
instantly
disencumbered
of
its
last
supports
nicholl
once
introduced
with
his
companions
inside
the
projectile
began
to
close
the
opening
by
means
of
a
strong
plate
held
in
position
by
powerful
screws
other
plates
closely
fitted
covered
the
lenticular
glasses
and
the
travelers
hermetically
enclosed
in
their
metal
prison
were
plunged
in
profound
darkness
and
now
my
dear
companions
said
michel
ardan
let
us
make
ourselves
at
home
i
am
a
domesticated
man
and
strong
in
housekeeping
we
are
bound
to
make
the
best
of
our
new
lodgings
and
make
ourselves
comfortable
and
first
let
us
try
and
see
a
little
gas
was
not
invented
for
moles
so
saying
the
thoughtless
fellow
lit
a
match
by
striking
it
on
the
sole
of
his
boot
and
approached
the
burner
fixed
to
the
receptacle
in
which
the
carbonized
hydrogen
stored
at
high
pressure
sufficed
for
the
lighting
and
warming
of
the
projectile
for
a
hundred
and
hours
or
six
days
and
six
nights
the
gas
caught
fire
and
thus
lighted
the
projectile
looked
like
a
comfortable
room
with
thickly
padded
walls
furnished
with
a
circular
divan
and
a
roof
rounded
in
the
shape
of
a
dome
michel
ardan
examined
everything
and
declared
himself
satisfied
with
his
installation
it
is
a
prison
said
he
but
a
traveling
prison
and
with
the
right
of
putting
my
nose
to
the
window
i
could
well
stand
a
lease
of
a
hundred
years
you
smile
barbicane
have
you
any
do
you
say
to
yourself
prison
may
be
our
tomb
tomb
perhaps
still
i
would
not
change
it
for
mahomet
which
floats
in
space
but
never
advances
an
inch
while
michel
ardan
was
speaking
barbicane
and
nicholl
were
making
their
last
preparations
nicholl
chronometer
marked
twenty
minutes
past
ten
when
the
three
travelers
were
finally
enclosed
in
their
projectile
this
chronometer
was
set
within
the
tenth
of
a
second
by
that
of
murchison
the
engineer
barbicane
consulted
it
my
friends
said
he
it
is
twenty
minutes
past
ten
at
seven
minutes
past
ten
murchison
will
launch
the
electric
spark
on
the
wire
which
communicates
with
the
charge
of
the
columbiad
at
that
precise
moment
we
shall
leave
our
spheroid
thus
we
still
have
minutes
to
remain
on
the
earth
minutes
thirteen
seconds
replied
the
methodical
nicholl
well
exclaimed
michel
ardan
in
a
tone
much
may
be
done
in
minutes
the
gravest
questions
of
morals
and
politics
may
be
discussed
and
even
solved
minutes
well
employed
are
worth
more
than
years
in
which
nothing
is
done
some
seconds
of
a
pascal
or
a
newton
are
more
precious
than
the
whole
existence
of
a
crowd
of
raw
simpletons
and
you
conclude
then
you
everlasting
talker
asked
barbicane
i
conclude
that
we
have
minutes
left
replied
ardan
only
said
nicholl
well
if
you
like
my
noble
captain
said
ardan
minutes
in
which
to
investigate
michel
said
barbicane
during
the
passage
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
investigate
the
most
difficult
questions
for
the
present
we
must
occupy
ourselves
with
our
departure
are
we
not
ready
doubtless
but
there
are
still
some
precautions
to
be
taken
to
deaden
as
much
as
possible
the
first
shock
have
we
not
the
placed
between
the
breaks
whose
elasticity
will
sufficiently
protect
us
i
hope
so
michel
replied
barbicane
gently
but
i
am
not
sure
ah
the
joker
exclaimed
michel
ardan
he
hopes
he
is
not
sure
and
he
waits
for
the
moment
when
we
are
encased
to
make
this
deplorable
admission
i
beg
to
be
allowed
to
get
out
and
how
asked
barbicane
humph
said
michel
ardan
it
is
not
easy
we
are
in
the
train
and
the
guard
whistle
will
sound
before
minutes
are
over
twenty
said
nicholl
for
some
moments
the
three
travelers
looked
at
each
other
then
they
began
to
examine
the
objects
imprisoned
with
them
everything
is
in
its
place
said
barbicane
we
have
now
to
decide
how
we
can
best
place
ourselves
to
resist
the
shock
position
can
not
be
an
indifferent
matter
and
we
must
as
much
as
possible
prevent
the
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
just
so
said
nicholl
then
replied
michel
ardan
ready
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
let
us
put
our
heads
down
and
our
feet
in
the
air
like
the
clowns
in
the
grand
circus
no
said
barbicane
let
us
stretch
ourselves
on
our
sides
we
shall
resist
the
shock
better
that
way
remember
that
when
the
projectile
starts
it
matters
little
whether
we
are
in
it
or
before
it
it
amounts
to
much
the
same
thing
if
it
is
only
the
same
thing
i
may
cheer
up
said
michel
ardan
do
you
approve
of
my
idea
nicholl
asked
barbicane
entirely
replied
the
captain
we
still
thirteen
minutes
and
a
half
that
nicholl
is
not
a
man
exclaimed
michel
he
is
a
chronometer
with
seconds
an
escape
and
eight
holes
but
his
companions
were
not
listening
they
were
taking
up
their
last
positions
with
the
most
perfect
coolness
they
were
like
two
methodical
travelers
in
a
car
seeking
to
place
themselves
as
comfortably
as
possible
we
might
well
ask
ourselves
of
what
materials
are
the
hearts
of
these
americans
made
to
whom
the
approach
of
the
most
frightful
danger
added
no
pulsation
three
thick
and
couches
had
been
placed
in
the
projectile
nicholl
and
barbicane
placed
them
in
the
center
of
the
disc
forming
the
floor
there
the
three
travelers
were
to
stretch
themselves
some
moments
before
their
departure
during
this
time
ardan
not
being
able
to
keep
still
turned
in
his
narrow
prison
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
chatting
with
his
friends
speaking
to
the
dogs
diana
and
satellite
to
whom
as
may
be
seen
he
had
given
significant
names
ah
diana
ah
satellite
he
exclaimed
teasing
them
so
you
are
going
to
show
the
the
good
habits
of
the
dogs
of
the
earth
that
will
do
honor
to
the
canine
race
if
ever
we
do
come
down
again
i
will
bring
a
cross
type
of
which
will
make
a
stir
if
there
dogs
in
the
moon
said
barbicane
there
are
said
michel
ardan
just
as
there
are
horses
cows
donkeys
and
chickens
i
bet
that
we
shall
find
chickens
a
hundred
dollars
we
shall
find
none
said
nicholl
done
my
captain
replied
ardan
clasping
nicholl
hand
but
by
the
bye
you
have
already
lost
three
bets
with
our
president
as
the
necessary
funds
for
the
enterprise
have
been
found
as
the
operation
of
casting
has
been
successful
and
lastly
as
the
columbiad
has
been
loaded
without
accident
six
thousand
dollars
yes
replied
nicholl
minutes
six
seconds
past
ten
it
is
understood
captain
well
before
another
quarter
of
an
hour
you
will
have
to
count
nine
thousand
dollars
to
the
president
four
thousand
because
the
columbiad
will
not
burst
and
five
thousand
because
the
projectile
will
rise
more
than
six
miles
in
the
air
i
have
the
dollars
replied
nicholl
slapping
the
pocket
of
this
coat
i
only
ask
to
be
allowed
to
pay
come
nicholl
i
see
that
you
are
a
man
of
method
which
i
could
never
be
but
indeed
you
have
made
a
series
of
bets
of
very
little
advantage
to
yourself
allow
me
to
tell
you
and
why
asked
nicholl
because
if
you
gain
the
first
the
columbiad
will
have
burst
and
the
projectile
with
it
and
barbicane
will
no
longer
be
there
to
reimburse
your
dollars
my
stake
is
deposited
at
the
bank
in
baltimore
replied
barbicane
simply
and
if
nicholl
is
not
there
it
will
go
to
his
heirs
ah
you
practical
men
exclaimed
michel
ardan
i
admire
you
the
more
for
not
being
able
to
understand
you
minutes
past
ten
said
nicholl
only
five
minutes
more
answered
barbicane
yes
five
little
minutes
replied
michel
ardan
and
we
are
enclosed
in
a
projectile
at
the
bottom
of
a
gun
feet
long
and
under
this
projectile
are
rammed
pounds
of
which
is
equal
to
pounds
of
ordinary
powder
and
friend
murchison
with
his
chronometer
in
hand
his
eye
fixed
on
the
needle
his
finger
on
the
electric
apparatus
is
counting
the
seconds
preparatory
to
launching
us
into
interplanetary
space
enough
michel
enough
said
barbicane
in
a
serious
voice
let
us
prepare
a
few
instants
alone
separate
us
from
an
eventful
moment
one
clasp
of
the
hand
my
friends
yes
exclaimed
michel
ardan
more
moved
than
he
wished
to
appear
and
the
three
bold
companions
were
united
in
a
last
embrace
god
preserve
us
said
the
religious
barbicane
michel
ardan
and
nicholl
stretched
themselves
on
the
couches
placed
in
the
center
of
the
disc
minutes
past
ten
murmured
the
captain
twenty
seconds
more
barbicane
quickly
put
out
the
gas
and
lay
down
by
his
companions
and
the
profound
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
ticking
of
the
chronometer
marking
the
seconds
suddenly
a
dreadful
shock
was
felt
and
the
projectile
under
the
force
of
six
billions
of
litres
of
gas
developed
by
the
combustion
of
pyroxyle
mounted
into
space
chapter
ii
the
first
what
had
happened
what
effect
had
this
frightful
shock
produced
had
the
ingenuity
of
the
constructors
of
the
projectile
obtained
any
happy
result
had
the
shock
been
deadened
thanks
to
the
springs
the
four
plugs
the
and
the
had
they
been
able
to
subdue
the
frightful
pressure
of
the
initiatory
speed
of
more
than
yards
which
was
enough
to
traverse
paris
or
new
york
in
a
second
this
was
evidently
the
question
suggested
to
the
thousand
spectators
of
this
moving
scene
they
forgot
the
aim
of
the
journey
and
thought
only
of
the
travelers
and
if
one
of
them
joseph
maston
for
example
could
have
cast
one
glimpse
into
the
projectile
what
would
he
have
seen
nothing
then
the
darkness
was
profound
but
its
conical
partitions
had
resisted
wonderfully
not
a
rent
or
a
dent
anywhere
the
wonderful
projectile
was
not
even
heated
under
the
intense
deflagration
of
the
powder
nor
liquefied
as
they
seemed
to
fear
in
a
shower
of
aluminum
the
interior
showed
but
little
disorder
indeed
only
a
few
objects
had
been
violently
thrown
toward
the
roof
but
the
most
important
seemed
not
to
have
suffered
from
the
shock
at
all
their
fixtures
were
intact
on
the
movable
disc
sunk
down
to
the
bottom
by
the
smashing
of
the
and
the
escape
of
the
water
three
bodies
lay
apparently
lifeless
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
did
they
still
breathe
or
was
the
projectile
nothing
now
but
a
metal
coffin
bearing
three
corpses
into
space
some
minutes
after
the
departure
of
the
projectile
one
of
the
bodies
moved
shook
its
arms
lifted
its
head
and
finally
succeeded
in
getting
on
its
knees
it
was
michel
ardan
he
felt
himself
all
over
gave
a
sonorous
hem
and
then
said
michel
ardan
is
whole
how
about
the
others
the
courageous
frenchman
tried
to
rise
but
could
not
stand
his
head
swam
from
the
rush
of
blood
he
was
blind
he
was
a
drunken
man
said
he
it
produces
the
same
effect
as
two
bottles
of
corton
though
perhaps
less
agreeable
to
swallow
then
passing
his
hand
several
times
across
his
forehead
and
rubbing
his
temples
he
called
in
a
firm
voice
nicholl
barbicane
he
waited
anxiously
no
answer
not
even
a
sigh
to
show
that
the
hearts
of
his
companions
were
still
beating
he
called
again
the
same
silence
the
devil
he
exclaimed
they
look
as
if
they
had
fallen
from
a
fifth
story
on
their
heads
bah
he
added
with
that
imperturbable
confidence
which
nothing
could
check
if
a
frenchman
can
get
on
his
knees
two
americans
ought
to
be
able
to
get
on
their
feet
but
first
let
us
light
up
ardan
felt
the
tide
of
life
return
by
degrees
his
blood
became
calm
and
returned
to
its
accustomed
circulation
another
effort
restored
his
equilibrium
he
succeeded
in
rising
drew
a
match
from
his
pocket
and
approaching
the
burner
lighted
it
the
receiver
had
not
suffered
at
all
the
gas
had
not
escaped
besides
the
smell
would
have
betrayed
it
and
in
that
case
michel
ardan
could
not
have
carried
a
lighted
match
with
impunity
through
the
space
filled
with
hydrogen
the
gas
mixing
with
the
air
would
have
produced
a
detonating
mixture
and
the
explosion
would
have
finished
what
the
shock
had
perhaps
begun
when
the
burner
was
lit
ardan
leaned
over
the
bodies
of
his
companions
they
were
lying
one
on
the
other
an
inert
mass
nicholl
above
barbicane
underneath
ardan
lifted
the
captain
propped
him
up
against
the
divan
and
began
to
rub
vigorously
this
means
used
with
judgment
restored
nicholl
who
opened
his
eyes
and
instantly
recovering
his
presence
of
mind
seized
ardan
hand
and
looked
around
him
and
barbicane
said
he
each
in
turn
replied
michel
ardan
i
began
with
you
nicholl
because
you
were
on
the
top
now
let
us
look
to
barbicane
saying
which
ardan
and
nicholl
raised
the
president
of
the
gun
club
and
laid
him
on
the
divan
he
seemed
to
have
suffered
more
than
either
of
his
companions
he
was
bleeding
but
nicholl
was
reassured
by
finding
that
the
hemorrhage
came
from
a
slight
wound
on
the
shoulder
a
mere
graze
which
he
bound
up
carefully
still
barbicane
was
a
long
time
coming
to
himself
which
frightened
his
friends
who
did
not
spare
friction
he
breathes
though
said
nicholl
putting
his
ear
to
the
chest
of
the
wounded
man
yes
replied
ardan
he
breathes
like
a
man
who
has
some
notion
of
that
daily
operation
rub
nicholl
let
us
rub
harder
and
the
two
improvised
practitioners
worked
so
hard
and
so
well
that
barbicane
recovered
his
senses
he
opened
his
eyes
sat
up
took
his
two
friends
by
the
hands
and
his
first
words
were
nicholl
are
we
moving
nicholl
and
ardan
looked
at
each
other
they
had
not
yet
troubled
themselves
about
the
projectile
their
first
thought
had
been
for
the
traveler
not
for
the
car
well
are
we
really
moving
repeated
michel
ardan
or
quietly
resting
on
the
soil
of
florida
asked
nicholl
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
added
michel
ardan
what
an
idea
exclaimed
the
president
and
this
double
hypothesis
suggested
by
his
companions
had
the
effect
of
recalling
him
to
his
senses
in
any
case
they
could
not
decide
on
the
position
of
the
projectile
its
apparent
immovability
and
the
want
of
communication
with
the
outside
prevented
them
from
solving
the
question
perhaps
the
projectile
was
unwinding
its
course
through
space
perhaps
after
a
short
rise
it
had
fallen
upon
the
earth
or
even
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
fall
which
the
narrowness
of
the
peninsula
of
florida
would
render
not
impossible
the
case
was
serious
the
problem
interesting
and
one
that
must
be
solved
as
soon
as
possible
thus
highly
excited
moral
energy
triumphed
over
physical
weakness
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
listened
outside
was
perfect
silence
but
the
thick
padding
was
enough
to
intercept
all
sounds
coming
from
the
earth
but
one
circumstance
struck
barbicane
that
the
temperature
inside
the
projectile
was
singularly
high
the
president
drew
a
thermometer
from
its
case
and
consulted
it
the
instrument
showed
fahr
yes
he
exclaimed
yes
we
are
moving
this
stifling
heat
penetrating
through
the
partitions
of
the
projectile
is
produced
by
its
friction
on
the
atmospheric
strata
it
will
soon
diminish
because
we
are
already
floating
in
space
and
after
having
nearly
stifled
we
shall
have
to
suffer
intense
cold
what
said
michel
ardan
according
to
your
showing
barbicane
we
are
already
beyond
the
limits
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
without
a
doubt
michel
listen
to
me
it
is
minutes
past
ten
we
have
been
gone
about
eight
minutes
and
if
our
initiatory
speed
has
not
been
checked
by
the
friction
six
seconds
would
be
enough
for
us
to
pass
through
the
forty
miles
of
atmosphere
which
surrounds
the
globe
just
so
replied
nicholl
but
in
what
proportion
do
you
estimate
the
diminution
of
speed
by
friction
in
the
proportion
of
nicholl
this
diminution
is
considerable
but
according
to
my
calculations
it
is
nothing
less
if
then
we
had
an
initiatory
speed
of
yards
on
leaving
the
atmosphere
this
speed
would
be
reduced
to
yards
in
any
case
we
have
already
passed
through
this
interval
and
and
then
said
michel
ardan
friend
nicholl
has
lost
his
two
bets
four
thousand
dollars
because
the
columbiad
did
not
burst
five
thousand
dollars
because
the
projectile
has
risen
more
than
six
miles
now
nicholl
pay
up
let
us
prove
it
first
said
the
captain
and
we
will
pay
afterward
it
is
quite
possible
that
barbicane
reasoning
is
correct
and
that
i
have
lost
my
nine
thousand
dollars
but
a
new
hypothesis
presents
itself
to
my
mind
and
it
annuls
the
wager
what
is
that
asked
barbicane
quickly
the
hypothesis
that
for
some
reason
or
other
fire
was
never
set
to
the
powder
and
we
have
not
started
at
all
my
goodness
captain
exclaimed
michel
ardan
that
hypothesis
is
not
worthy
of
my
brain
it
can
not
be
a
serious
one
for
have
we
not
been
half
annihilated
by
the
shock
did
i
not
recall
you
to
life
is
not
the
president
shoulder
still
bleeding
from
the
blow
it
has
received
granted
replied
nicholl
but
one
question
well
captain
did
you
hear
the
detonation
which
certainly
ought
to
be
loud
no
replied
ardan
much
surprised
certainly
i
did
not
hear
the
detonation
and
you
barbicane
nor
i
either
very
well
said
nicholl
well
now
murmured
the
president
why
did
we
not
hear
the
detonation
the
three
friends
looked
at
each
other
with
a
disconcerted
air
it
was
quite
an
inexplicable
phenomenon
the
projectile
had
started
and
consequently
there
must
have
been
a
detonation
let
us
first
find
out
where
we
are
said
barbicane
and
let
down
this
panel
this
very
simple
operation
was
soon
accomplished
the
nuts
which
held
the
bolts
to
the
outer
plates
of
the
scuttle
gave
way
under
the
pressure
of
the
english
wrench
these
bolts
were
pushed
outside
and
the
buffers
covered
with
stopped
up
the
holes
which
let
them
through
immediately
the
outer
plate
fell
back
upon
its
hinges
like
a
porthole
and
the
lenticular
glass
which
closed
the
scuttle
appeared
a
similar
one
was
let
into
the
thick
partition
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
projectile
another
in
the
top
of
the
dome
and
finally
a
fourth
in
the
middle
of
the
base
they
could
therefore
make
observations
in
four
different
directions
the
firmament
by
the
side
and
most
direct
windows
the
earth
or
the
moon
by
the
upper
and
under
openings
in
the
projectile
barbicane
and
his
two
companions
immediately
rushed
to
the
uncovered
window
but
it
was
lit
by
no
ray
of
light
profound
darkness
surrounded
them
which
however
did
not
prevent
the
president
from
exclaiming
no
my
friends
we
have
not
fallen
back
upon
the
earth
no
nor
are
we
submerged
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
yes
we
are
mounting
into
space
see
those
stars
shining
in
the
night
and
that
impenetrable
darkness
heaped
up
between
the
earth
and
us
hurrah
hurrah
exclaimed
michel
ardan
and
nicholl
in
one
voice
indeed
this
thick
darkness
proved
that
the
projectile
had
left
the
earth
for
the
soil
brilliantly
lit
by
the
would
have
been
visible
to
the
travelers
if
they
had
been
lying
on
its
surface
this
darkness
also
showed
that
the
projectile
had
passed
the
atmospheric
strata
for
the
diffused
light
spread
in
the
air
would
have
been
reflected
on
the
metal
walls
which
reflection
was
wanting
this
light
would
have
lit
the
window
and
the
window
was
dark
doubt
was
no
longer
possible
the
travelers
had
left
the
earth
i
have
lost
said
nicholl
i
congratulate
you
replied
ardan
here
are
the
nine
thousand
dollars
said
the
captain
drawing
a
roll
of
paper
dollars
from
his
pocket
will
you
have
a
receipt
for
it
asked
barbicane
taking
the
sum
if
you
do
not
mind
answered
nicholl
it
is
more
and
coolly
and
seriously
as
if
he
had
been
at
his
the
president
drew
forth
his
notebook
tore
out
a
blank
leaf
wrote
a
proper
receipt
in
pencil
dated
and
signed
it
with
the
usual
flourish
and
gave
it
to
the
captain
who
carefully
placed
it
in
his
pocketbook
michel
ardan
taking
off
his
hat
bowed
to
his
two
companions
without
speaking
so
much
formality
under
such
circumstances
left
him
speechless
he
had
never
before
seen
anything
so
american
this
is
a
purely
french
habit
this
affair
settled
barbicane
and
nicholl
had
returned
to
the
window
and
were
watching
the
constellations
the
stars
looked
like
bright
points
on
the
black
sky
but
from
that
side
they
could
not
see
the
orb
of
night
which
traveling
from
east
to
west
would
rise
by
degrees
toward
the
zenith
its
absence
drew
the
following
remark
from
ardan
and
the
moon
will
she
perchance
fail
at
our
rendezvous
do
not
alarm
yourself
said
barbicane
our
future
globe
is
at
its
post
but
we
can
not
see
her
from
this
side
let
us
open
the
other
as
barbicane
was
about
leaving
the
window
to
open
the
opposite
scuttle
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
approach
of
a
brilliant
object
it
was
an
enormous
disc
whose
colossal
dimension
could
not
be
estimated
its
face
which
was
turned
to
the
earth
was
very
bright
one
might
have
thought
it
a
small
moon
reflecting
the
light
of
the
large
one
she
advanced
with
great
speed
and
seemed
to
describe
an
orbit
round
the
earth
which
would
intersect
the
passage
of
the
projectile
this
body
revolved
upon
its
axis
and
exhibited
the
phenomena
of
all
celestial
bodies
abandoned
in
space
ah
exclaimed
michel
ardan
what
is
that
another
projectile
barbicane
did
not
answer
the
appearance
of
this
enormous
body
surprised
and
troubled
him
a
collision
was
possible
and
might
be
attended
with
deplorable
results
either
the
projectile
would
deviate
from
its
path
or
a
shock
breaking
its
impetus
might
precipitate
it
to
earth
or
lastly
it
might
be
irresistibly
drawn
away
by
the
powerful
asteroid
the
president
caught
at
a
glance
the
consequences
of
these
three
hypotheses
either
of
which
would
one
way
or
the
other
bring
their
experiment
to
an
unsuccessful
and
fatal
termination
his
companions
stood
silently
looking
into
space
the
object
grew
rapidly
as
it
approached
them
and
by
an
optical
illusion
the
projectile
seemed
to
be
throwing
itself
before
it
by
jove
exclaimed
michel
ardan
we
shall
run
into
one
another
instinctively
the
travelers
drew
back
their
dread
was
great
but
it
did
not
last
many
seconds
the
asteroid
passed
several
hundred
yards
from
the
projectile
and
disappeared
not
so
much
from
the
rapidity
of
its
course
as
that
its
face
being
opposite
the
moon
it
was
suddenly
merged
into
the
perfect
darkness
of
space
a
happy
journey
to
you
exclaimed
michel
ardan
with
a
sigh
of
relief
surely
infinity
of
space
is
large
enough
for
a
poor
little
projectile
to
walk
through
without
fear
now
what
is
this
portentous
globe
which
nearly
struck
us
i
know
replied
barbicane
oh
indeed
you
know
everything
it
is
said
barbicane
a
simple
meteorite
but
an
enormous
one
which
the
attraction
of
the
earth
has
retained
as
a
satellite
is
it
possible
exclaimed
michel
ardan
the
earth
then
has
two
moons
like
neptune
yes
my
friends
two
moons
though
it
passes
generally
for
having
only
one
but
this
second
moon
is
so
small
and
its
speed
so
great
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
can
not
see
it
it
was
by
noticing
disturbances
that
a
french
astronomer
petit
was
able
to
determine
the
existence
of
this
second
satellite
and
calculate
its
elements
according
to
his
observations
this
meteorite
will
accomplish
its
revolution
around
the
earth
in
three
hours
and
twenty
minutes
which
implies
a
wonderful
rate
of
speed
do
all
astronomers
admit
the
existence
of
this
satellite
asked
nicholl
no
replied
barbicane
but
if
like
us
they
had
met
it
they
could
no
longer
doubt
it
indeed
i
think
that
this
meteorite
which
had
it
struck
the
projectile
would
have
much
embarrassed
us
will
give
us
the
means
of
deciding
what
our
position
in
space
is
how
said
ardan
because
its
distance
is
known
and
when
we
met
it
we
were
exactly
four
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
surface
of
the
terrestrial
globe
more
than
two
thousand
french
leagues
exclaimed
michel
ardan
that
beats
the
express
trains
of
the
pitiful
globe
called
the
earth
i
should
think
so
replied
nicholl
consulting
his
chronometer
it
is
eleven
and
it
is
only
thirteen
minutes
since
we
left
the
american
continent
only
thirteen
minutes
said
barbicane
yes
said
nicholl
and
if
our
initiatory
speed
of
twelve
thousand
yards
has
been
kept
up
we
shall
have
made
about
twenty
thousand
miles
in
the
hour
that
is
all
very
well
my
friends
said
the
president
but
the
insoluble
question
still
remains
why
did
we
not
hear
the
detonation
of
the
columbiad
for
want
of
an
answer
the
conversation
dropped
and
barbicane
began
thoughtfully
to
let
down
the
shutter
of
the
second
side
he
succeeded
and
through
the
uncovered
glass
the
moon
filled
the
projectile
with
a
brilliant
light
nicholl
as
an
economical
man
put
out
the
gas
now
useless
and
whose
brilliancy
prevented
any
observation
of
the
space
the
lunar
disc
shone
with
wonderful
purity
her
rays
no
longer
filtered
through
the
vapory
atmosphere
of
the
terrestrial
globe
shone
through
the
glass
filling
the
air
in
the
interior
of
the
projectile
with
silvery
reflections
the
black
curtain
of
the
firmament
in
reality
heightened
the
moon
brilliancy
which
in
this
void
of
ether
unfavorable
to
diffusion
did
not
eclipse
the
neighboring
stars
the
heavens
thus
seen
presented
quite
a
new
aspect
and
one
which
the
human
eye
could
never
dream
of
one
may
conceive
the
interest
with
which
these
bold
men
watched
the
orb
of
night
the
great
aim
of
their
journey
in
its
motion
the
earth
satellite
was
insensibly
nearing
the
zenith
the
mathematical
point
which
it
ought
to
attain
hours
later
her
mountains
her
plains
every
projection
was
as
clearly
discernible
to
their
eyes
as
if
they
were
observing
it
from
some
spot
upon
the
earth
but
its
light
was
developed
through
space
with
wonderful
intensity
the
disc
shone
like
a
platinum
mirror
of
the
earth
flying
from
under
their
feet
the
travelers
had
lost
all
recollection
it
was
captain
nicholl
who
first
recalled
their
attention
to
the
vanishing
globe
yes
said
michel
ardan
do
not
let
us
be
ungrateful
to
it
since
we
are
leaving
our
country
let
our
last
looks
be
directed
to
it
i
wish
to
see
the
earth
once
more
before
it
is
quite
hidden
from
my
eyes
to
satisfy
his
companions
barbicane
began
to
uncover
the
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
which
would
allow
them
to
observe
the
earth
direct
the
disc
which
the
force
of
the
projection
had
beaten
down
to
the
base
was
removed
not
without
difficulty
its
fragments
placed
carefully
against
a
wall
might
serve
again
upon
occasion
then
a
circular
gap
appeared
nineteen
inches
in
diameter
hollowed
out
of
the
lower
part
of
the
projectile
a
glass
cover
six
inches
thick
and
strengthened
with
upper
fastenings
closed
it
tightly
beneath
was
fixed
an
aluminum
plate
held
in
place
by
bolts
the
screws
being
undone
and
the
bolts
let
go
the
plate
fell
down
and
visible
communication
was
established
between
the
interior
and
the
exterior
michel
ardan
knelt
by
the
glass
it
was
cloudy
seemingly
opaque
well
he
exclaimed
and
the
earth
the
earth
said
barbicane
there
it
is
what
that
little
thread
that
silver
crescent
doubtless
michel
in
four
days
when
the
moon
will
be
full
at
the
very
time
we
shall
reach
it
the
earth
will
be
new
and
will
only
appear
to
us
as
a
slender
crescent
which
will
soon
disappear
and
for
some
days
will
be
enveloped
in
utter
darkness
that
the
earth
repeated
michel
ardan
looking
with
all
his
eyes
at
the
thin
slip
of
his
native
planet
the
explanation
given
by
president
barbicane
was
correct
the
earth
with
respect
to
the
projectile
was
entering
its
last
phase
it
was
in
its
octant
and
showed
a
crescent
finely
traced
on
the
dark
background
of
the
sky
its
light
rendered
bluish
by
the
thick
strata
of
the
atmosphere
was
less
intense
than
that
of
the
crescent
moon
but
it
was
of
considerable
dimensions
and
looked
like
an
enormous
arch
stretched
across
the
firmament
some
parts
brilliantly
lighted
especially
on
its
concave
part
showed
the
presence
of
high
mountains
often
disappearing
behind
thick
spots
which
are
never
seen
on
the
lunar
disc
they
were
rings
of
clouds
placed
concentrically
round
the
terrestrial
globe
while
the
travelers
were
trying
to
pierce
the
profound
darkness
a
brilliant
cluster
of
shooting
stars
burst
upon
their
eyes
hundreds
of
meteorites
ignited
by
the
friction
of
the
atmosphere
irradiated
the
shadow
of
the
luminous
train
and
lined
the
cloudy
parts
of
the
disc
with
their
fire
at
this
period
the
earth
was
in
its
perihelion
and
the
month
of
december
is
so
propitious
to
these
shooting
stars
that
astronomers
have
counted
as
many
as
thousand
in
an
hour
but
michel
ardan
disdaining
scientific
reasonings
preferred
thinking
that
the
earth
was
thus
saluting
the
departure
of
her
three
children
with
her
most
brilliant
fireworks
indeed
this
was
all
they
saw
of
the
globe
lost
in
the
solar
world
rising
and
setting
to
the
great
planets
like
a
simple
morning
or
evening
star
this
globe
where
they
had
left
all
their
affections
was
nothing
more
than
a
fugitive
crescent
long
did
the
three
friends
look
without
speaking
though
united
in
heart
while
the
projectile
sped
onward
with
an
speed
then
an
irresistible
drowsiness
crept
over
their
brain
was
it
weariness
of
body
and
mind
no
doubt
for
after
the
of
those
last
hours
passed
upon
earth
reaction
was
inevitable
well
said
nicholl
since
we
must
sleep
let
us
sleep
and
stretching
themselves
on
their
couches
they
were
all
three
soon
in
a
profound
slumber
but
they
had
not
forgotten
themselves
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
barbicane
sat
up
suddenly
and
rousing
his
companions
with
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
i
have
found
it
what
have
you
found
asked
michel
ardan
jumping
from
his
bed
the
reason
why
we
did
not
hear
the
detonation
of
the
columbiad
and
it
is
said
nicholl
because
our
projectile
traveled
faster
than
the
sound
chapter
iii
their
place
of
shelter
this
curious
but
certainly
correct
explanation
once
given
the
three
friends
returned
to
their
slumbers
could
they
have
found
a
calmer
or
more
peaceful
spot
to
sleep
in
on
the
earth
houses
towns
cottages
and
country
feel
every
shock
given
to
the
exterior
of
the
globe
on
sea
the
vessels
rocked
by
the
waves
are
still
in
motion
in
the
air
the
balloon
oscillates
incessantly
on
the
fluid
strata
of
divers
densities
this
projectile
alone
floating
in
perfect
space
in
the
midst
of
perfect
silence
offered
perfect
repose
thus
the
sleep
of
our
adventurous
travelers
might
have
been
indefinitely
prolonged
if
an
unexpected
noise
had
not
awakened
them
at
about
seven
in
the
morning
of
the
of
december
eight
hours
after
their
departure
this
noise
was
a
very
natural
barking
the
dogs
it
is
the
dogs
exclaimed
michel
ardan
rising
at
once
they
are
hungry
said
nicholl
by
jove
replied
michel
we
have
forgotten
them
where
are
they
asked
barbicane
they
looked
and
found
one
of
the
animals
crouched
under
the
divan
terrified
and
shaken
by
the
initiatory
shock
it
had
remained
in
the
corner
till
its
voice
returned
with
the
pangs
of
hunger
it
was
the
amiable
diana
still
very
confused
who
crept
out
of
her
retreat
though
not
without
much
persuasion
michel
ardan
encouraging
her
with
most
gracious
words
come
diana
said
he
come
my
girl
thou
whose
destiny
will
be
marked
in
the
cynegetic
annals
thou
whom
the
pagans
would
have
given
as
companion
to
the
god
anubis
and
christians
as
friend
to
roch
thou
who
art
rushing
into
interplanetary
space
and
wilt
perhaps
be
the
eve
of
all
selenite
dogs
come
diana
come
here
diana
flattered
or
not
advanced
by
degrees
uttering
plaintive
cries
good
said
barbicane
i
see
eve
but
where
is
adam
adam
replied
michel
adam
can
not
be
far
off
he
is
there
somewhere
we
must
call
him
satellite
here
satellite
but
satellite
did
not
appear
diana
would
not
leave
off
howling
they
found
however
that
she
was
not
bruised
and
they
gave
her
a
pie
which
silenced
her
complaints
as
to
satellite
he
seemed
quite
lost
they
had
to
hunt
a
long
time
before
finding
him
in
one
of
the
upper
compartments
of
the
projectile
whither
some
unaccountable
shock
must
have
violently
hurled
him
the
poor
beast
much
hurt
was
in
a
piteous
state
the
devil
said
michel
they
brought
the
unfortunate
dog
down
with
great
care
its
skull
had
been
broken
against
the
roof
and
it
seemed
unlikely
that
he
could
recover
from
such
a
shock
meanwhile
he
was
stretched
comfortably
on
a
cushion
once
there
he
heaved
a
sigh
we
will
take
care
of
you
said
michel
we
are
responsible
for
your
existence
i
would
rather
lose
an
arm
than
a
paw
of
my
poor
satellite
saying
which
he
offered
some
water
to
the
wounded
dog
who
swallowed
it
with
avidity
this
attention
paid
the
travelers
watched
the
earth
and
the
moon
attentively
the
earth
was
now
only
discernible
by
a
cloudy
disc
ending
in
a
crescent
rather
more
contracted
than
that
of
the
previous
evening
but
its
expanse
was
still
enormous
compared
with
that
of
the
moon
which
was
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
perfect
circle
by
jove
said
michel
ardan
i
am
really
sorry
that
we
did
not
start
when
the
earth
was
full
that
is
to
say
when
our
globe
was
in
opposition
to
the
sun
why
said
nicholl
because
we
should
have
seen
our
continents
and
seas
in
a
new
light
the
first
resplendent
under
the
solar
rays
the
latter
cloudy
as
represented
on
some
maps
of
the
world
i
should
like
to
have
seen
those
poles
of
the
earth
on
which
the
eye
of
man
has
never
yet
rested
i
dare
say
replied
barbicane
but
if
the
earth
had
been
the
moon
would
have
been
that
is
to
say
invisible
because
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
it
is
better
for
us
to
see
the
destination
we
wish
to
reach
than
the
point
of
departure
you
are
right
barbicane
replied
captain
nicholl
and
besides
when
we
have
reached
the
moon
we
shall
have
time
during
the
long
lunar
nights
to
consider
at
our
leisure
the
globe
on
which
our
likenesses
swarm
our
likenesses
exclaimed
michel
ardan
they
are
no
more
our
likenesses
than
the
selenites
are
we
inhabit
a
new
world
peopled
by
ourselves
the
projectile
i
am
likeness
and
barbicane
is
nicholl
beyond
us
around
us
human
nature
is
at
an
end
and
we
are
the
only
population
of
this
microcosm
until
we
become
pure
selenites
in
about
hours
replied
the
captain
which
means
to
say
asked
michel
ardan
that
it
is
eight
replied
nicholl
very
well
retorted
michel
then
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
find
even
the
shadow
of
a
reason
why
we
should
not
go
to
breakfast
indeed
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
star
could
not
live
without
eating
and
their
stomachs
were
suffering
from
the
imperious
laws
of
hunger
michel
ardan
as
a
frenchman
was
declared
chief
cook
an
important
function
which
raised
no
rival
the
gas
gave
sufficient
heat
for
the
culinary
apparatus
and
the
provision
box
furnished
the
elements
of
this
first
feast
the
breakfast
began
with
three
bowls
of
excellent
soup
thanks
to
the
liquefaction
in
hot
water
of
those
precious
cakes
of
liebig
prepared
from
the
best
parts
of
the
ruminants
of
the
pampas
to
the
soup
succeeded
some
beefsteaks
compressed
by
an
hydraulic
press
as
tender
and
succulent
as
if
brought
straight
from
the
kitchen
of
an
english
michel
who
was
imaginative
maintained
that
they
were
even
red
preserved
vegetables
fresher
than
nature
said
the
amiable
michel
succeeded
the
dish
of
meat
and
was
followed
by
some
cups
of
tea
with
bread
and
butter
after
the
american
fashion
the
beverage
was
declared
exquisite
and
was
due
to
the
infusion
of
the
choicest
leaves
of
which
the
emperor
of
russia
had
given
some
chests
for
the
benefit
of
the
travelers
and
lastly
to
crown
the
repast
ardan
had
brought
out
a
fine
bottle
of
nuits
which
was
found
by
chance
in
the
the
three
friends
drank
to
the
union
of
the
earth
and
her
satellite
and
as
if
he
had
not
already
done
enough
for
the
generous
wine
which
he
had
distilled
on
the
slopes
of
burgundy
the
sun
chose
to
be
part
of
the
party
at
this
moment
the
projectile
emerged
from
the
conical
shadow
cast
by
the
terrestrial
globe
and
the
rays
of
the
radiant
orb
struck
the
lower
disc
of
the
projectile
direct
occasioned
by
the
angle
which
the
moon
orbit
makes
with
that
of
the
earth
the
sun
exclaimed
michel
ardan
no
doubt
replied
barbicane
i
expected
it
but
said
michel
the
conical
shadow
which
the
earth
leaves
in
space
extends
beyond
the
moon
far
beyond
it
if
the
atmospheric
refraction
is
not
taken
into
consideration
said
barbicane
but
when
the
moon
is
enveloped
in
this
shadow
it
is
because
the
centers
of
the
three
stars
the
sun
the
earth
and
the
moon
are
all
in
one
and
the
same
straight
line
then
the
coincide
with
the
of
the
moon
and
there
is
an
eclipse
if
we
had
started
when
there
was
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
all
our
passage
would
have
been
in
the
shadow
which
would
have
been
a
pity
why
because
though
we
are
floating
in
space
our
projectile
bathed
in
the
solar
rays
will
receive
light
and
heat
it
economizes
the
gas
which
is
in
every
respect
a
good
economy
indeed
under
these
rays
which
no
atmosphere
can
temper
either
in
temperature
or
brilliancy
the
projectile
grew
warm
and
bright
as
if
it
had
passed
suddenly
from
winter
to
summer
the
moon
above
the
sun
beneath
were
inundating
it
with
their
fire
it
is
pleasant
here
said
nicholl
i
should
think
so
said
michel
ardan
with
a
little
earth
spread
on
our
aluminum
planet
we
should
have
green
peas
in
hours
i
have
but
one
fear
which
is
that
the
walls
of
the
projectile
might
melt
calm
yourself
my
worthy
friend
replied
barbicane
the
projectile
withstood
a
very
much
higher
temperature
than
this
as
it
slid
through
the
strata
of
the
atmosphere
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
it
did
not
look
like
a
meteor
on
fire
to
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
in
florida
but
then
maston
will
think
we
are
roasted
what
astonishes
me
said
barbicane
is
that
we
have
not
been
that
was
a
danger
we
had
not
provided
for
i
feared
it
said
nicholl
simply
and
you
never
mentioned
it
my
sublime
captain
exclaimed
michel
ardan
clasping
his
friend
hand
barbicane
now
began
to
settle
himself
in
the
projectile
as
if
he
was
never
to
leave
it
one
must
remember
that
this
aerial
car
had
a
base
with
a
of
square
feet
its
height
to
the
roof
was
twelve
feet
carefully
laid
out
in
the
inside
and
little
encumbered
by
instruments
and
traveling
utensils
which
each
had
their
particular
place
it
left
the
three
travelers
a
certain
freedom
of
movement
the
thick
window
inserted
in
the
bottom
could
bear
any
amount
of
weight
and
barbicane
and
his
companions
walked
upon
it
as
if
it
were
solid
plank
but
the
sun
striking
it
directly
with
its
rays
lit
the
interior
of
the
projectile
from
beneath
thus
producing
singular
effects
of
light
they
began
by
investigating
the
state
of
their
store
of
water
and
provisions
neither
of
which
had
suffered
thanks
to
the
care
taken
to
deaden
the
shock
their
provisions
were
abundant
and
plentiful
enough
to
last
the
three
travelers
for
more
than
a
year
barbicane
wished
to
be
cautious
in
case
the
projectile
should
land
on
a
part
of
the
moon
which
was
utterly
barren
as
to
water
and
the
reserve
of
brandy
which
consisted
of
fifty
gallons
there
was
only
enough
for
two
months
but
according
to
the
last
observations
of
astronomers
the
moon
had
a
low
dense
and
thick
atmosphere
at
least
in
the
deep
valleys
and
there
springs
and
streams
could
not
fail
thus
during
their
passage
and
for
the
first
year
of
their
settlement
on
the
lunar
continent
these
adventurous
explorers
would
suffer
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
now
about
the
air
in
the
projectile
there
too
they
were
secure
reiset
and
regnaut
apparatus
intended
for
the
production
of
oxygen
was
supplied
with
chlorate
of
potassium
for
two
months
they
necessarily
consumed
a
certain
quantity
of
gas
for
they
were
obliged
to
keep
the
producing
substance
at
a
temperature
of
above
but
there
again
they
were
all
safe
the
apparatus
only
wanted
a
little
care
but
it
was
not
enough
to
renew
the
oxygen
they
must
absorb
the
carbonic
acid
produced
by
expiration
during
the
last
twelve
hours
the
atmosphere
of
the
projectile
had
become
charged
with
this
deleterious
gas
nicholl
discovered
the
state
of
the
air
by
observing
diana
panting
painfully
the
carbonic
acid
by
a
phenomenon
similar
to
that
produced
in
the
famous
grotto
del
cane
had
collected
at
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
owing
to
its
weight
poor
diana
with
her
head
low
would
suffer
before
her
masters
from
the
presence
of
this
gas
but
captain
nicholl
hastened
to
remedy
this
state
of
things
by
placing
on
the
floor
several
receivers
containing
caustic
potash
which
he
shook
about
for
a
time
and
this
substance
greedy
of
carbonic
acid
soon
completely
absorbed
it
thus
purifying
the
air
an
inventory
of
instruments
was
then
begun
the
thermometers
and
barometers
had
resisted
all
but
one
minimum
thermometer
the
glass
of
which
was
broken
an
excellent
aneroid
was
drawn
from
the
wadded
box
which
contained
it
and
hung
on
the
wall
of
course
it
was
only
affected
by
and
marked
the
pressure
of
the
air
inside
the
projectile
but
it
also
showed
the
quantity
of
moisture
which
it
contained
at
that
moment
its
needle
oscillated
between
and
it
was
fine
weather
barbicane
had
also
brought
several
compasses
which
he
found
intact
one
must
understand
that
under
present
conditions
their
needles
were
acting
that
is
without
any
direction
indeed
at
the
distance
they
were
from
the
earth
the
magnetic
pole
could
have
no
perceptible
action
upon
the
apparatus
but
the
box
placed
on
the
lunar
disc
might
perhaps
exhibit
some
strange
phenomena
in
any
case
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
whether
the
earth
satellite
submitted
like
herself
to
its
magnetic
influence
a
hypsometer
to
measure
the
height
of
the
lunar
mountains
a
sextant
to
take
the
height
of
the
sun
glasses
which
would
be
useful
as
they
neared
the
moon
all
these
instruments
were
carefully
looked
over
and
pronounced
good
in
spite
of
the
violent
shock
as
to
the
pickaxes
and
different
tools
which
were
especial
choice
as
to
the
sacks
of
different
kinds
of
grain
and
shrubs
which
michel
ardan
hoped
to
transplant
into
selenite
ground
they
were
stowed
away
in
the
upper
part
of
the
projectile
there
was
a
sort
of
granary
there
loaded
with
things
which
the
extravagant
frenchman
had
heaped
up
what
they
were
no
one
knew
and
the
fellow
did
not
explain
now
and
then
he
climbed
up
by
riveted
to
the
walls
but
kept
the
inspection
to
himself
he
arranged
and
rearranged
he
plunged
his
hand
rapidly
into
certain
mysterious
boxes
singing
in
one
of
the
falsest
of
voices
an
old
french
refrain
to
enliven
the
situation
barbicane
observed
with
some
interest
that
his
guns
and
other
arms
had
not
been
damaged
these
were
important
because
heavily
loaded
they
were
to
help
lessen
the
fall
of
the
projectile
when
drawn
by
the
lunar
attraction
after
having
passed
the
point
of
neutral
attraction
on
to
the
surface
a
fall
which
ought
to
be
six
times
less
rapid
than
it
would
have
been
on
the
earth
surface
thanks
to
the
difference
of
bulk
the
inspection
ended
with
general
satisfaction
when
each
returned
to
watch
space
through
the
side
windows
and
the
lower
glass
coverlid
there
was
the
same
view
the
whole
extent
of
the
celestial
sphere
swarmed
with
stars
and
constellations
of
wonderful
purity
enough
to
drive
an
astronomer
out
of
his
mind
on
one
side
the
sun
like
the
mouth
of
a
lighted
oven
a
dazzling
disc
without
a
halo
standing
out
on
the
dark
background
of
the
sky
on
the
other
the
moon
returning
its
fire
by
reflection
and
apparently
motionless
in
the
midst
of
the
starry
world
then
a
large
spot
seemingly
nailed
to
the
firmament
bordered
by
a
silvery
cord
it
was
the
earth
here
and
there
nebulous
masses
like
large
flakes
of
starry
snow
and
from
the
zenith
to
the
nadir
an
immense
ring
formed
by
an
impalpable
dust
of
stars
the
milky
way
in
the
midst
of
which
the
sun
ranks
only
as
a
star
of
the
fourth
magnitude
the
observers
could
not
take
their
eyes
from
this
novel
spectacle
of
which
no
description
could
give
an
adequate
idea
what
reflections
it
suggested
what
emotions
hitherto
unknown
awoke
in
their
souls
barbicane
wished
to
begin
the
relation
of
his
journey
while
under
its
first
impressions
and
hour
after
hour
took
notes
of
all
facts
happening
in
the
beginning
of
the
enterprise
he
wrote
quietly
with
his
large
square
writing
in
a
style
during
this
time
nicholl
the
calculator
looked
over
the
minutes
of
their
passage
and
worked
out
figures
with
unparalleled
dexterity
michel
ardan
chatted
first
with
barbicane
who
did
not
answer
him
and
then
with
nicholl
who
did
not
hear
him
with
diana
who
understood
none
of
his
theories
and
lastly
with
himself
questioning
and
answering
going
and
coming
busy
with
a
thousand
details
at
one
time
bent
over
the
lower
glass
at
another
roosting
in
the
heights
of
the
projectile
and
always
singing
in
this
microcosm
he
represented
french
loquacity
and
excitability
and
we
beg
you
to
believe
that
they
were
well
represented
the
day
or
rather
for
the
expression
is
not
correct
the
lapse
of
twelve
hours
which
forms
a
day
upon
the
earth
closed
with
a
plentiful
supper
carefully
prepared
no
accident
of
any
nature
had
yet
happened
to
shake
the
travelers
confidence
so
full
of
hope
already
sure
of
success
they
slept
peacefully
while
the
projectile
under
an
uniformly
decreasing
speed
was
crossing
the
sky
chapter
iv
a
little
algebra
the
night
passed
without
incident
the
word
night
however
is
scarcely
applicable
the
position
of
the
projectile
with
regard
to
the
sun
did
not
change
astronomically
it
was
daylight
on
the
lower
part
and
night
on
the
upper
so
when
during
this
narrative
these
words
are
used
they
represent
the
lapse
of
time
between
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
upon
the
earth
the
travelers
sleep
was
rendered
more
peaceful
by
the
projectile
excessive
speed
for
it
seemed
absolutely
motionless
not
a
motion
betrayed
its
onward
course
through
space
the
rate
of
progress
however
rapid
it
might
be
can
not
produce
any
sensible
effect
on
the
human
frame
when
it
takes
place
in
a
vacuum
or
when
the
mass
of
air
circulates
with
the
body
which
is
carried
with
it
what
inhabitant
of
the
earth
perceives
its
speed
which
however
is
at
the
rate
of
miles
per
hour
motion
under
such
conditions
is
felt
no
more
than
repose
and
when
a
body
is
in
repose
it
will
remain
so
as
long
as
no
strange
force
displaces
it
if
moving
it
will
not
stop
unless
an
obstacle
comes
in
its
way
this
indifference
to
motion
or
repose
is
called
inertia
barbicane
and
his
companions
might
have
believed
themselves
perfectly
stationary
being
shut
up
in
the
projectile
indeed
the
effect
would
have
been
the
same
if
they
had
been
on
the
outside
of
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
moon
which
was
increasing
above
them
they
might
have
sworn
that
they
were
floating
in
complete
stagnation
that
morning
the
of
december
the
travelers
were
awakened
by
a
joyous
but
unexpected
noise
it
was
the
crowing
of
a
cock
which
sounded
through
the
car
michel
ardan
who
was
the
first
on
his
feet
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
projectile
and
shutting
a
box
the
lid
of
which
was
partly
open
said
in
a
low
voice
will
you
hold
your
tongue
that
creature
will
spoil
my
design
but
nicholl
and
barbicane
were
awake
a
cock
said
nicholl
why
no
my
friends
michel
answered
quickly
it
was
i
who
wished
to
awake
you
by
this
rural
sound
so
saying
he
gave
vent
to
a
splendid
which
would
have
done
honor
to
the
proudest
of
the
two
americans
could
not
help
laughing
fine
talent
that
said
nicholl
looking
suspiciously
at
his
companion
yes
said
michel
a
joke
in
my
country
it
is
very
gallic
they
play
the
cock
so
in
the
best
society
then
turning
the
conversation
barbicane
do
you
know
what
i
have
been
thinking
of
all
night
no
answered
the
president
of
our
cambridge
friends
you
have
already
remarked
that
i
am
an
ignoramus
in
mathematical
subjects
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
find
out
how
the
savants
of
the
observatory
were
able
to
calculate
what
initiatory
speed
the
projectile
ought
to
have
on
leaving
the
columbiad
in
order
to
attain
the
moon
you
mean
to
say
replied
barbicane
to
attain
that
neutral
point
where
the
terrestrial
and
lunar
attractions
are
equal
for
starting
from
that
point
situated
about
of
the
distance
traveled
over
the
projectile
would
simply
fall
upon
the
moon
on
account
of
its
weight
so
be
it
said
michel
but
once
more
how
could
they
calculate
the
initiatory
speed
nothing
can
be
easier
replied
barbicane
and
you
knew
how
to
make
that
calculation
asked
michel
ardan
perfectly
nicholl
and
i
would
have
made
it
if
the
observatory
had
not
saved
us
the
trouble
very
well
old
barbicane
replied
michel
they
might
have
cut
off
my
head
beginning
at
my
feet
before
they
could
have
made
me
solve
that
problem
because
you
do
not
know
algebra
answered
barbicane
quietly
ah
there
you
are
you
eaters
of
you
think
you
have
said
all
when
you
have
said
michel
said
barbicane
can
you
use
a
forge
without
a
hammer
or
a
plow
without
a
plowshare
hardly
well
algebra
is
a
tool
like
the
plow
or
the
hammer
and
a
good
tool
to
those
who
know
how
to
use
it
seriously
quite
seriously
and
can
you
use
that
tool
in
my
presence
if
it
will
interest
you
and
show
me
how
they
calculated
the
initiatory
speed
of
our
car
yes
my
worthy
friend
taking
into
consideration
all
the
elements
of
the
problem
the
distance
from
the
center
of
the
earth
to
the
center
of
the
moon
of
the
radius
of
the
earth
of
its
bulk
and
of
the
bulk
of
the
moon
i
can
tell
exactly
what
ought
to
be
the
initiatory
speed
of
the
projectile
and
that
by
a
simple
formula
let
us
see
you
shall
see
it
only
i
shall
not
give
you
the
real
course
drawn
by
the
projectile
between
the
moon
and
the
earth
in
considering
their
motion
round
the
sun
no
i
shall
consider
these
two
orbs
as
perfectly
motionless
which
will
answer
all
our
purpose
and
why
because
it
will
be
trying
to
solve
the
problem
called
problem
of
the
three
bodies
for
which
the
integral
calculus
is
not
yet
far
enough
advanced
then
said
michel
ardan
in
his
sly
tone
mathematics
have
not
said
their
last
word
certainly
not
replied
barbicane
well
perhaps
the
selenites
have
carried
the
integral
calculus
farther
than
you
have
and
by
the
bye
what
is
this
calculus
it
is
a
calculation
the
converse
of
the
differential
replied
barbicane
seriously
much
obliged
it
is
all
very
clear
no
doubt
and
now
continued
barbicane
a
slip
of
paper
and
a
bit
of
pencil
and
before
a
is
over
i
will
have
found
the
required
formula
half
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
before
barbicane
raising
his
head
showed
michel
ardan
a
page
covered
with
algebraical
signs
in
which
the
general
formula
for
the
solution
was
contained
well
and
does
nicholl
understand
what
that
means
of
course
michel
replied
the
captain
all
these
signs
which
seem
cabalistic
to
you
form
the
plainest
the
clearest
and
the
most
logical
language
to
those
who
know
how
to
read
it
and
you
pretend
nicholl
asked
michel
that
by
means
of
these
hieroglyphics
more
incomprehensible
than
the
egyptian
ibis
you
can
find
what
initiatory
speed
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
projectile
incontestably
replied
nicholl
and
even
by
this
same
formula
i
can
always
tell
you
its
speed
at
any
point
of
its
transit
on
your
word
on
my
word
then
you
are
as
cunning
as
our
president
no
michel
the
difficult
part
is
what
barbicane
has
done
that
is
to
get
an
equation
which
shall
satisfy
all
the
conditions
of
the
problem
the
remainder
is
only
a
question
of
arithmetic
requiring
merely
the
knowledge
of
the
four
rules
that
is
something
replied
michel
ardan
who
for
his
life
could
not
do
addition
right
and
who
defined
the
rule
as
a
chinese
puzzle
which
allowed
one
to
obtain
all
sorts
of
totals
the
expression
zero
which
you
see
in
that
equation
is
the
speed
which
the
projectile
will
have
on
leaving
the
atmosphere
just
so
said
nicholl
it
is
from
that
point
that
we
must
calculate
the
velocity
since
we
know
already
that
the
velocity
at
departure
was
exactly
one
and
a
half
times
more
than
on
leaving
the
atmosphere
i
understand
no
more
said
michel
it
is
a
very
simple
calculation
said
barbicane
not
as
simple
as
i
am
retorted
michel
that
means
that
when
our
projectile
reached
the
limits
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
it
had
already
lost
of
its
initiatory
speed
as
much
as
that
yes
my
friend
merely
by
friction
against
the
atmospheric
strata
you
understand
that
the
faster
it
goes
the
more
resistance
it
meets
with
from
the
air
that
i
admit
answered
michel
and
i
understand
it
although
your
x
and
zero
and
algebraic
formula
are
rattling
in
my
head
like
nails
in
a
bag
first
effects
of
algebra
replied
barbicane
and
now
to
finish
we
are
going
to
prove
the
given
number
of
these
different
expressions
that
is
work
out
their
value
finish
me
replied
michel
barbicane
took
the
paper
and
began
to
make
his
calculations
with
great
rapidity
nicholl
looked
over
and
greedily
read
the
work
as
it
proceeded
that
it
that
it
at
last
he
cried
is
it
clear
asked
barbicane
it
is
written
in
letters
of
fire
said
nicholl
wonderful
fellows
muttered
ardan
do
you
understand
it
at
last
asked
barbicane
do
i
understand
it
cried
ardan
my
head
is
splitting
with
it
and
now
said
nicholl
to
find
out
the
speed
of
the
projectile
when
it
leaves
the
atmosphere
we
have
only
to
calculate
that
the
captain
as
a
practical
man
equal
to
all
difficulties
began
to
write
with
frightful
rapidity
divisions
and
multiplications
grew
under
his
fingers
the
figures
were
like
hail
on
the
white
page
barbicane
watched
him
while
michel
ardan
nursed
a
growing
headache
with
both
hands
very
well
asked
barbicane
after
some
minutes
silence
well
replied
nicholl
every
calculation
made
zero
that
is
to
say
the
speed
necessary
for
the
projectile
on
leaving
the
atmosphere
to
enable
it
to
reach
the
equal
point
of
attraction
ought
to
be
yes
said
barbicane
twelve
thousand
yards
what
exclaimed
barbicane
starting
you
say
twelve
thousand
yards
the
devil
cried
the
president
making
a
gesture
of
despair
what
is
the
matter
asked
michel
ardan
much
surprised
what
is
the
matter
why
if
at
this
moment
our
speed
had
already
diminished
by
friction
the
initiatory
speed
ought
to
have
been
seventeen
thousand
yards
and
the
cambridge
observatory
declared
that
twelve
thousand
yards
was
enough
at
starting
and
our
projectile
which
only
started
with
that
speed
well
asked
nicholl
well
it
will
not
be
enough
good
we
shall
not
be
able
to
reach
the
neutral
point
the
deuce
we
shall
not
even
get
halfway
in
the
name
of
the
projectile
exclaimed
michel
ardan
jumping
as
if
it
was
already
on
the
point
of
striking
the
terrestrial
globe
and
we
shall
fall
back
upon
the
earth
chapter
v
the
cold
of
space
this
revelation
came
like
a
thunderbolt
who
could
have
expected
such
an
error
in
calculation
barbicane
would
not
believe
it
nicholl
revised
his
figures
they
were
exact
as
to
the
formula
which
had
determined
them
they
could
not
suspect
its
truth
it
was
evident
that
an
initiatory
velocity
of
seventeen
thousand
yards
in
the
first
second
was
necessary
to
enable
them
to
reach
the
neutral
point
the
three
friends
looked
at
each
other
silently
there
was
no
thought
of
breakfast
barbicane
with
clenched
teeth
knitted
brows
and
hands
clasped
convulsively
was
watching
through
the
window
nicholl
had
crossed
his
arms
and
was
examining
his
calculations
michel
ardan
was
muttering
that
is
just
like
these
scientific
men
they
never
do
anything
else
i
would
give
twenty
pistoles
if
we
could
fall
upon
the
cambridge
observatory
and
crush
it
together
with
the
whole
lot
of
dabblers
in
figures
which
it
contains
suddenly
a
thought
struck
the
captain
which
he
at
once
communicated
to
barbicane
ah
said
he
it
is
seven
in
the
morning
we
have
already
been
gone
hours
more
than
half
our
passage
is
over
and
we
are
not
falling
that
i
am
aware
of
barbicane
did
not
answer
but
after
a
rapid
glance
at
the
captain
took
a
pair
of
compasses
wherewith
to
measure
the
angular
distance
of
the
terrestrial
globe
then
from
the
lower
window
he
took
an
exact
observation
and
noticed
that
the
projectile
was
apparently
stationary
then
rising
and
wiping
his
forehead
on
which
large
drops
of
perspiration
were
standing
he
put
some
figures
on
paper
nicholl
understood
that
the
president
was
deducting
from
the
terrestrial
diameter
the
projectile
distance
from
the
earth
he
watched
him
anxiously
no
exclaimed
barbicane
after
some
moments
no
we
are
not
falling
no
we
are
already
more
than
leagues
from
the
earth
we
have
passed
the
point
at
which
the
projectile
would
have
stopped
if
its
speed
had
only
been
yards
at
starting
we
are
still
going
up
that
is
evident
replied
nicholl
and
we
must
conclude
that
our
initial
speed
under
the
power
of
the
pounds
of
must
have
exceeded
the
required
yards
now
i
can
understand
how
after
thirteen
minutes
only
we
met
the
second
satellite
which
gravitates
round
the
earth
at
more
than
leagues
distance
and
this
explanation
is
the
more
probable
added
barbicane
because
in
throwing
off
the
water
enclosed
between
its
the
projectile
found
itself
lightened
of
a
considerable
weight
just
so
said
nicholl
ah
my
brave
nicholl
we
are
saved
very
well
then
said
michel
ardan
quietly
as
we
are
safe
let
us
have
breakfast
nicholl
was
not
mistaken
the
initial
speed
had
been
very
fortunately
much
above
that
estimated
by
the
cambridge
observatory
but
the
cambridge
observatory
had
nevertheless
made
a
mistake
the
travelers
recovered
from
this
false
alarm
breakfasted
merrily
if
they
ate
a
good
deal
they
talked
more
their
confidence
was
greater
after
than
before
the
incident
of
the
algebra
why
should
we
not
succeed
said
michel
ardan
why
should
we
not
arrive
safely
we
are
launched
we
have
no
obstacle
before
us
no
stones
in
the
way
the
road
is
open
more
so
than
that
of
a
ship
battling
with
the
sea
more
open
than
that
of
a
balloon
battling
with
the
wind
and
if
a
ship
can
reach
its
destination
a
balloon
go
where
it
pleases
why
can
not
our
projectile
attain
its
end
and
aim
it
attain
it
said
barbicane
if
only
to
do
honor
to
the
americans
added
michel
ardan
the
only
people
who
could
bring
such
an
enterprise
to
a
happy
termination
and
the
only
one
which
could
produce
a
president
barbicane
ah
now
we
are
no
longer
uneasy
i
begin
to
think
what
will
become
of
us
we
shall
get
right
royally
weary
barbicane
and
nicholl
made
a
gesture
of
denial
but
i
have
provided
for
the
contingency
my
friends
replied
michel
you
have
only
to
speak
and
i
have
chess
draughts
cards
and
dominoes
at
your
disposal
nothing
is
wanting
but
a
what
exclaimed
barbicane
you
brought
away
such
trifles
certainly
replied
michel
and
not
only
to
distract
ourselves
but
also
with
the
laudable
intention
of
endowing
the
selenite
smoking
divans
with
them
my
friend
said
barbicane
if
the
moon
is
inhabited
its
inhabitants
must
have
appeared
some
thousands
of
years
before
those
of
the
earth
for
we
can
not
doubt
that
their
star
is
much
older
than
ours
if
then
these
selenites
have
existed
their
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
and
if
their
brain
is
of
the
same
organization
of
the
human
brain
they
have
already
invented
all
that
we
have
invented
and
even
what
we
may
invent
in
future
ages
they
have
nothing
to
learn
from
and
we
have
everything
to
learn
from
what
said
michel
you
believe
that
they
have
artists
like
phidias
michael
angelo
or
raphael
yes
poets
like
homer
virgil
milton
lamartine
and
hugo
i
am
sure
of
it
philosophers
like
plato
aristotle
descartes
kant
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
scientific
men
like
archimedes
euclid
pascal
newton
i
could
swear
it
comic
writers
like
arnal
and
photographers
like
like
nadar
certain
then
friend
barbicane
if
they
are
as
strong
as
we
are
and
even
stronger
these
selenites
why
have
they
not
tried
to
communicate
with
the
earth
why
have
they
not
launched
a
lunar
projectile
to
our
terrestrial
regions
who
told
you
that
they
have
never
done
so
said
barbicane
seriously
indeed
added
nicholl
it
would
be
easier
for
them
than
for
us
for
two
reasons
first
because
the
attraction
on
the
surface
is
six
times
less
than
on
that
of
the
earth
which
would
allow
a
projectile
to
rise
more
easily
secondly
because
it
would
be
enough
to
send
such
a
projectile
only
at
leagues
instead
of
which
would
require
the
force
of
projection
to
be
ten
times
less
strong
then
continued
michel
i
repeat
it
why
have
they
not
done
it
and
i
repeat
said
barbicane
who
told
you
that
they
have
not
done
it
when
thousands
of
years
before
man
appeared
on
earth
and
the
projectile
where
is
the
projectile
i
demand
to
see
the
projectile
my
friend
replied
barbicane
the
sea
covers
of
our
globe
from
that
we
may
draw
five
good
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
lunar
projectile
if
ever
launched
is
now
at
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
unless
it
sped
into
some
crevasse
at
that
period
when
the
crust
of
the
earth
was
not
yet
hardened
old
barbicane
said
michel
you
have
an
answer
for
everything
and
i
bow
before
your
wisdom
but
there
is
one
hypothesis
that
would
suit
me
better
than
all
the
others
which
is
the
selenites
being
older
than
we
are
wiser
and
have
not
invented
gunpowder
at
this
moment
diana
joined
in
the
conversation
by
a
sonorous
barking
she
was
asking
for
her
breakfast
ah
said
michel
ardan
in
our
discussion
we
have
forgotten
diana
and
satellite
immediately
a
pie
was
given
to
the
dog
which
devoured
it
hungrily
do
you
see
barbicane
said
michel
we
should
have
made
a
second
noah
ark
of
this
projectile
and
borne
with
us
to
the
moon
a
couple
of
every
kind
of
domestic
animal
i
dare
say
but
room
would
have
failed
us
oh
said
michel
we
might
have
squeezed
a
little
the
fact
is
replied
nicholl
that
cows
bulls
and
horses
and
all
ruminants
would
have
been
very
useful
on
the
lunar
continent
but
unfortunately
the
car
could
neither
have
been
made
a
stable
nor
a
shed
well
we
might
have
at
least
brought
a
donkey
only
a
little
donkey
that
courageous
beast
which
old
silenus
loved
to
mount
i
love
those
old
donkeys
they
are
the
least
favored
animals
in
creation
they
are
not
only
beaten
while
alive
but
even
after
they
are
dead
how
do
you
make
that
out
asked
barbicane
why
said
michel
they
make
their
skins
into
drums
barbicane
and
nicholl
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
ridiculous
remark
but
a
cry
from
their
merry
companion
stopped
them
the
latter
was
leaning
over
the
spot
where
satellite
lay
he
rose
saying
my
good
satellite
is
no
longer
ah
said
nicholl
no
answered
michel
he
is
dead
there
added
he
in
a
piteous
tone
that
is
embarrassing
i
much
fear
my
poor
diana
that
you
will
leave
no
progeny
in
the
lunar
regions
indeed
the
unfortunate
satellite
had
not
survived
its
wound
it
was
quite
dead
michel
ardan
looked
at
his
friends
with
a
rueful
countenance
one
question
presents
itself
said
barbicane
we
can
not
keep
the
dead
body
of
this
dog
with
us
for
the
next
hours
no
certainly
not
replied
nicholl
but
our
scuttles
are
fixed
on
hinges
they
can
be
let
down
we
will
open
one
and
throw
the
body
out
into
space
the
president
thought
for
some
moments
and
then
said
yes
we
must
do
so
but
at
the
same
time
taking
very
great
precautions
why
asked
michel
for
two
reasons
which
you
will
understand
answered
barbicane
the
first
relates
to
the
air
shut
up
in
the
projectile
and
of
which
we
must
lose
as
little
as
possible
but
we
manufacture
the
air
only
in
part
we
make
only
the
oxygen
my
worthy
michel
and
with
regard
to
that
we
must
watch
that
the
apparatus
does
not
furnish
the
oxygen
in
too
great
a
quantity
for
an
excess
would
bring
us
very
serious
physiological
troubles
but
if
we
make
the
oxygen
we
do
not
make
the
azote
that
medium
which
the
lungs
do
not
absorb
and
which
ought
to
remain
intact
and
that
azote
will
escape
rapidly
through
the
open
scuttles
oh
the
time
for
throwing
out
poor
satellite
said
michel
agreed
but
we
must
act
quickly
and
the
second
reason
asked
michel
the
second
reason
is
that
we
must
not
let
the
outer
cold
which
is
excessive
penetrate
the
projectile
or
we
shall
be
frozen
to
death
but
the
sun
the
sun
warms
our
projectile
which
absorbs
its
rays
but
it
does
not
warm
the
vacuum
in
which
we
are
floating
at
this
moment
where
there
is
no
air
there
is
no
more
heat
than
diffused
light
and
the
same
with
darkness
it
is
cold
where
the
sun
rays
do
not
strike
direct
this
temperature
is
only
the
temperature
produced
by
the
radiation
of
the
stars
that
is
to
say
what
the
terrestrial
globe
would
undergo
if
the
sun
disappeared
one
day
which
is
not
to
be
feared
replied
nicholl
who
knows
said
michel
ardan
but
in
admitting
that
the
sun
does
not
go
out
might
it
not
happen
that
the
earth
might
move
away
from
it
there
said
barbicane
there
is
michel
with
his
ideas
and
continued
michel
do
we
not
know
that
in
the
earth
passed
through
the
tail
of
a
comet
or
let
us
suppose
a
comet
whose
power
of
attraction
is
greater
than
that
of
the
sun
the
terrestrial
orbit
will
bend
toward
the
wandering
star
and
the
earth
becoming
its
satellite
will
be
drawn
such
a
distance
that
the
rays
of
the
sun
will
have
no
action
on
its
surface
that
happen
indeed
replied
barbicane
but
the
consequences
of
such
a
displacement
need
not
be
so
formidable
as
you
suppose
and
why
not
because
the
heat
and
cold
would
be
equalized
on
our
globe
it
has
been
calculated
that
had
our
earth
been
carried
along
in
its
course
by
the
comet
of
at
its
perihelion
that
is
its
nearest
approach
to
the
sun
it
would
have
undergone
a
heat
times
greater
than
that
of
summer
but
this
heat
which
is
sufficient
to
evaporate
the
waters
would
have
formed
a
thick
ring
of
cloud
which
would
have
modified
that
excessive
temperature
hence
the
compensation
between
the
cold
of
the
aphelion
and
the
heat
of
the
perihelion
at
how
many
degrees
asked
nicholl
is
the
temperature
of
the
planetary
spaces
estimated
formerly
replied
barbicane
it
was
greatly
exagerated
but
now
after
the
calculations
of
fourier
of
the
french
academy
of
science
it
is
not
supposed
to
exceed
centigrade
below
zero
pooh
said
michel
that
nothing
it
is
very
much
replied
barbicane
the
temperature
which
was
observed
in
the
polar
regions
at
melville
island
and
fort
reliance
that
is
fahrenheit
below
zero
if
i
mistake
not
said
nicholl
pouillet
another
savant
estimates
the
temperature
of
space
at
fahrenheit
below
zero
we
shall
however
be
able
to
verify
these
calculations
for
ourselves
not
at
present
because
the
solar
rays
beating
directly
upon
our
thermometer
would
give
on
the
contrary
a
very
high
temperature
but
when
we
arrive
in
the
moon
during
its
fifteen
days
of
night
at
either
face
we
shall
have
leisure
to
make
the
experiment
for
our
satellite
lies
in
a
vacuum
what
do
you
mean
by
a
vacuum
asked
michel
is
it
perfectly
such
it
is
absolutely
void
of
air
and
is
the
air
replaced
by
nothing
whatever
by
the
ether
only
replied
barbicane
and
pray
what
is
the
ether
the
ether
my
friend
is
an
agglomeration
of
imponderable
atoms
which
relatively
to
their
dimensions
are
as
far
removed
from
each
other
as
the
celestial
bodies
are
in
space
it
is
these
atoms
which
by
their
vibratory
motion
produce
both
light
and
heat
in
the
universe
they
now
proceeded
to
the
burial
of
satellite
they
had
merely
to
drop
him
into
space
in
the
same
way
that
sailors
drop
a
body
into
the
sea
but
as
president
barbicane
suggested
they
must
act
quickly
so
as
to
lose
as
little
as
possible
of
that
air
whose
elasticity
would
rapidly
have
spread
it
into
space
the
bolts
of
the
right
scuttle
the
opening
of
which
measured
about
twelve
inches
across
were
carefully
drawn
while
michel
quite
grieved
prepared
to
launch
his
dog
into
space
the
glass
raised
by
a
powerful
lever
which
enabled
it
to
overcome
the
pressure
of
the
inside
air
on
the
walls
of
the
projectile
turned
rapidly
on
its
hinges
and
satellite
was
thrown
out
scarcely
a
particle
of
air
could
have
escaped
and
the
operation
was
so
successful
that
later
on
barbicane
did
not
fear
to
dispose
of
the
rubbish
which
encumbered
the
car
chapter
vi
question
and
answer
on
the
of
december
when
the
travelers
awoke
after
hours
journey
the
chronometer
marked
five
of
the
terrestrial
morning
in
time
it
was
just
over
five
hours
and
forty
minutes
half
of
that
assigned
to
their
sojourn
in
the
projectile
but
they
had
already
accomplished
nearly
of
the
way
this
peculiarity
was
due
to
their
regularly
decreasing
speed
now
when
they
observed
the
earth
through
the
lower
window
it
looked
like
nothing
more
than
a
dark
spot
drowned
in
the
solar
rays
no
more
crescent
no
more
cloudy
light
the
next
day
at
midnight
the
earth
would
be
at
the
very
moment
when
the
moon
would
be
full
above
the
orb
of
night
was
nearing
the
line
followed
by
the
projectile
so
as
to
meet
it
at
the
given
hour
all
around
the
black
vault
was
studded
with
brilliant
points
which
seemed
to
move
slowly
but
at
the
great
distance
they
were
from
them
their
relative
size
did
not
seem
to
change
the
sun
and
stars
appeared
exactly
as
they
do
to
us
upon
earth
as
to
the
moon
she
was
considerably
larger
but
the
glasses
not
very
powerful
did
not
allow
them
as
yet
to
make
any
useful
observations
upon
her
surface
or
reconnoiter
her
topographically
or
geologically
thus
the
time
passed
in
conversations
all
about
the
moon
each
one
brought
forward
his
own
contingent
of
particular
facts
barbicane
and
nicholl
always
serious
michel
ardan
always
enthusiastic
the
projectile
its
situation
its
direction
incidents
which
might
happen
the
precautions
necessitated
by
their
fall
on
to
the
moon
were
inexhaustible
matters
of
conjecture
as
they
were
breakfasting
a
question
of
michel
relating
to
the
projectile
provoked
rather
a
curious
answer
from
barbicane
which
is
worth
repeating
michel
supposing
it
to
be
roughly
stopped
while
still
under
its
formidable
initial
speed
wished
to
know
what
the
consequences
of
the
stoppage
would
have
been
but
said
barbicane
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
have
been
stopped
but
let
us
suppose
so
said
michel
it
is
an
impossible
supposition
said
the
practical
barbicane
unless
that
impulsive
force
had
failed
but
even
then
its
speed
would
diminish
by
degrees
and
it
would
not
have
stopped
suddenly
admit
that
it
had
struck
a
body
in
space
what
body
why
that
enormous
meteor
which
we
met
then
said
nicholl
the
projectile
would
have
been
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
we
with
it
more
than
that
replied
barbicane
we
should
have
been
burned
to
death
burned
exclaimed
michel
by
jove
i
am
sorry
it
did
not
happen
to
see
and
you
would
have
seen
replied
barbicane
it
is
known
now
that
heat
is
only
a
modification
of
motion
when
water
is
warmed
that
is
to
say
when
heat
is
added
to
it
its
particles
are
set
in
motion
well
said
michel
that
is
an
ingenious
theory
and
a
true
one
my
worthy
friend
for
it
explains
every
phenomenon
of
caloric
heat
is
but
the
motion
of
atoms
a
simple
oscillation
of
the
particles
of
a
body
when
they
apply
the
brake
to
a
train
the
train
comes
to
a
stop
but
what
becomes
of
the
motion
which
it
had
previously
possessed
it
is
transformed
into
heat
and
the
brake
becomes
hot
why
do
they
grease
the
axles
of
the
wheels
to
prevent
their
heating
because
this
heat
would
be
generated
by
the
motion
which
is
thus
lost
by
transformation
yes
i
understand
replied
michel
perfectly
for
example
when
i
have
run
a
long
time
when
i
am
swimming
when
i
am
perspiring
in
large
drops
why
am
i
obliged
to
stop
simply
because
my
motion
is
changed
into
heat
barbicane
could
not
help
smiling
at
michel
reply
then
returning
to
his
theory
said
thus
in
case
of
a
shock
it
would
have
been
with
our
projectile
as
with
a
ball
which
falls
in
a
burning
state
after
having
struck
the
metal
plate
it
is
its
motion
which
is
turned
into
heat
consequently
i
affirm
that
if
our
projectile
had
struck
the
meteor
its
speed
thus
suddenly
checked
would
have
raised
a
heat
great
enough
to
turn
it
into
vapor
instantaneously
then
asked
nicholl
what
would
happen
if
the
earth
motion
were
to
stop
suddenly
her
temperature
would
be
raised
to
such
a
pitch
said
barbicane
that
she
would
be
at
once
reduced
to
vapor
well
said
michel
that
is
a
way
of
ending
the
earth
which
will
greatly
simplify
things
and
if
the
earth
fell
upon
the
sun
asked
nicholl
according
to
calculation
replied
barbicane
the
fall
would
develop
a
heat
equal
to
that
produced
by
globes
of
coal
each
equal
in
bulk
to
our
terrestrial
globe
good
additional
heat
for
the
sun
replied
michel
ardan
of
which
the
inhabitants
of
uranus
or
neptune
would
doubtless
not
complain
they
must
be
perished
with
cold
on
their
planets
thus
my
friends
said
barbicane
all
motion
suddenly
stopped
produces
heat
and
this
theory
allows
us
to
infer
that
the
heat
of
the
solar
disc
is
fed
by
a
hail
of
meteors
falling
incessantly
on
its
surface
they
have
even
calculated
oh
dear
murmured
michel
the
figures
are
coming
they
have
even
calculated
continued
the
imperturbable
barbicane
that
the
shock
of
each
meteor
on
the
sun
ought
to
produce
a
heat
equal
to
that
of
masses
of
coal
of
an
equal
bulk
and
what
is
the
solar
heat
asked
michel
it
is
equal
to
that
produced
by
the
combustion
of
a
stratum
of
coal
surrounding
the
sun
to
a
depth
of
miles
and
that
heat
would
be
able
to
boil
two
billions
nine
hundred
millions
of
cubic
myriameters
of
water
the
myriameter
is
equal
to
rather
more
than
cubic
yards
english
and
it
does
not
roast
us
exclaimed
michel
no
replied
barbicane
because
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
absorbs
of
the
solar
heat
besides
the
quantity
of
heat
intercepted
by
the
earth
is
but
a
billionth
part
of
the
entire
radiation
i
see
that
all
is
for
the
best
said
michel
and
that
this
atmosphere
is
a
useful
invention
for
it
not
only
allows
us
to
breathe
but
it
prevents
us
from
roasting
yes
said
nicholl
unfortunately
it
will
not
be
the
same
in
the
moon
bah
said
michel
always
hopeful
if
there
are
inhabitants
they
must
breathe
if
there
are
no
longer
any
they
must
have
left
enough
oxygen
for
three
people
if
only
at
the
bottom
of
ravines
where
its
own
weight
will
cause
it
to
accumulate
and
we
will
not
climb
the
mountains
that
is
all
and
michel
rising
went
to
look
at
the
lunar
disc
which
shone
with
intolerable
brilliancy
by
jove
said
he
it
must
be
hot
up
there
without
considering
replied
nicholl
that
the
day
lasts
hours
and
to
compensate
that
said
barbicane
the
nights
have
the
same
length
and
as
heat
is
restored
by
radiation
their
temperature
can
only
be
that
of
the
planetary
space
a
pretty
country
that
exclaimed
michel
never
mind
i
wish
i
was
there
ah
my
dear
comrades
it
will
be
rather
curious
to
have
the
earth
for
our
moon
to
see
it
rise
on
the
horizon
to
recognize
the
shape
of
its
continents
and
to
say
to
oneself
is
america
there
is
europe
then
to
follow
it
when
it
is
about
to
lose
itself
in
the
sun
rays
by
the
bye
barbicane
have
the
selenites
eclipses
yes
eclipses
of
the
sun
replied
barbicane
when
the
centers
of
the
three
orbs
are
on
a
line
the
earth
being
in
the
middle
but
they
are
only
partial
during
which
the
earth
cast
like
a
screen
upon
the
solar
disc
allows
the
greater
portion
to
be
seen
and
why
asked
nicholl
is
there
no
total
eclipse
does
not
the
cone
of
the
shadow
cast
by
the
earth
extend
beyond
the
moon
yes
if
we
do
not
take
into
consideration
the
refraction
produced
by
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
no
if
we
take
that
refraction
into
consideration
thus
let
lower
case
delta
be
the
horizontal
parallel
and
the
apparent
semidiameter
oh
said
michel
do
speak
plainly
you
man
of
algebra
very
well
replied
barbicane
in
popular
language
the
mean
distance
from
the
moon
to
the
earth
being
sixty
terrestrial
radii
the
length
of
the
cone
of
the
shadow
on
account
of
refraction
is
reduced
to
less
than
radii
the
result
is
that
when
there
are
eclipses
the
moon
finds
itself
beyond
the
cone
of
pure
shadow
and
that
the
sun
sends
her
its
rays
not
only
from
its
edges
but
also
from
its
center
then
said
michel
in
a
merry
tone
why
are
there
eclipses
when
there
ought
not
to
be
any
simply
because
the
solar
rays
are
weakened
by
this
refraction
and
the
atmosphere
through
which
they
pass
extinguished
the
greater
part
of
them
that
reason
satisfies
me
replied
michel
besides
we
shall
see
when
we
get
there
now
tell
me
barbicane
do
you
believe
that
the
moon
is
an
old
comet
there
an
idea
yes
replied
michel
with
an
amiable
swagger
i
have
a
few
ideas
of
that
sort
but
that
idea
does
not
spring
from
michel
answered
nicholl
well
then
i
am
a
plagiarist
no
doubt
about
it
according
to
the
ancients
the
arcadians
pretend
that
their
ancestors
inhabited
the
earth
before
the
moon
became
her
satellite
starting
from
this
fact
some
scientific
men
have
seen
in
the
moon
a
comet
whose
orbit
will
one
day
bring
it
so
near
to
the
earth
that
it
will
be
held
there
by
its
attraction
is
there
any
truth
in
this
hypothesis
asked
michel
none
whatever
said
barbicane
and
the
proof
is
that
the
moon
has
preserved
no
trace
of
the
gaseous
envelope
which
always
accompanies
comets
but
continued
nicholl
before
becoming
the
earth
satellite
could
not
the
moon
when
in
her
perihelion
pass
so
near
the
sun
as
by
evaporation
to
get
rid
of
all
those
gaseous
substances
it
is
possible
friend
nicholl
but
not
probable
why
not
because
faith
i
do
not
know
ah
exclaimed
michel
what
hundred
of
volumes
we
might
make
of
all
that
we
do
not
know
ah
indeed
what
time
is
it
asked
barbicane
three
answered
nicholl
how
time
goes
said
michel
in
the
conversation
of
scientific
men
such
as
we
are
certainly
i
feel
i
know
too
much
i
feel
that
i
am
becoming
a
well
saying
which
michel
hoisted
himself
to
the
roof
of
the
projectile
to
observe
the
moon
better
he
pretended
during
this
time
his
companions
were
watching
through
the
lower
glass
nothing
new
to
note
when
michel
ardan
came
down
he
went
to
the
side
scuttle
and
suddenly
they
heard
an
exclamation
of
surprise
what
is
it
asked
barbicane
the
president
approached
the
window
and
saw
a
sort
of
flattened
sack
floating
some
yards
from
the
projectile
this
object
seemed
as
motionless
as
the
projectile
and
was
consequently
animated
with
the
same
ascending
movement
what
is
that
machine
continued
michel
ardan
is
it
one
of
the
bodies
which
our
projectile
keeps
within
its
attraction
and
which
will
accompany
it
to
the
moon
what
astonishes
me
said
nicholl
is
that
the
specific
weight
of
the
body
which
is
certainly
less
than
that
of
the
projectile
allows
it
to
keep
so
perfectly
on
a
level
with
it
nicholl
replied
barbicane
after
a
moment
reflection
i
do
not
know
what
the
object
it
but
i
do
know
why
it
maintains
our
level
and
why
because
we
are
floating
in
space
my
dear
captain
and
in
space
bodies
fall
or
move
which
is
the
same
thing
with
equal
speed
whatever
be
their
weight
or
form
it
is
the
air
which
by
its
resistance
creates
these
differences
in
weight
when
you
create
a
vacuum
in
a
tube
the
objects
you
send
through
it
grains
of
dust
or
grains
of
lead
fall
with
the
same
rapidity
here
in
space
is
the
same
cause
and
the
same
effect
just
so
said
nicholl
and
everything
we
throw
out
of
the
projectile
will
accompany
it
until
it
reaches
the
moon
ah
fools
that
we
are
exclaimed
michel
why
that
expletive
asked
barbicane
because
we
might
have
filled
the
projectile
with
useful
objects
books
instruments
tools
etc
we
could
have
thrown
them
all
out
and
all
would
have
followed
in
our
train
but
happy
thought
why
can
not
we
walk
outside
like
the
meteor
why
can
not
we
launch
into
space
through
the
scuttle
what
enjoyment
it
would
be
to
feel
oneself
thus
suspended
in
ether
more
favored
than
the
birds
who
must
use
their
wings
to
keep
themselves
up
granted
said
barbicane
but
how
to
breathe
hang
the
air
to
fail
so
inopportunely
but
if
it
did
not
fail
michel
your
density
being
less
than
that
of
the
projectile
you
would
soon
be
left
behind
then
we
must
remain
in
our
car
we
must
ah
exclaimed
michel
in
a
load
voice
what
is
the
matter
asked
nicholl
i
know
i
guess
what
this
pretended
meteor
is
it
is
no
asteroid
which
is
accompanying
us
it
is
not
a
piece
of
a
planet
what
is
it
then
asked
barbicane
it
is
our
unfortunate
dog
it
is
diana
husband
indeed
this
deformed
unrecognizable
object
reduced
to
nothing
was
the
body
of
satellite
flattened
like
a
bagpipe
without
wind
and
ever
mounting
mounting
chapter
vii
a
moment
of
intoxication
thus
a
phenomenon
curious
but
explicable
was
happening
under
these
strange
conditions
every
object
thrown
from
the
projectile
would
follow
the
same
course
and
never
stop
until
it
did
there
was
a
subject
for
conversation
which
the
whole
evening
could
not
exhaust
besides
the
excitement
of
the
three
travelers
increased
as
they
drew
near
the
end
of
their
journey
they
expected
unforseen
incidents
and
new
phenomena
and
nothing
would
have
astonished
them
in
the
frame
of
mind
they
then
were
in
their
overexcited
imagination
went
faster
than
the
projectile
whose
speed
was
evidently
diminishing
though
insensibly
to
themselves
but
the
moon
grew
larger
to
their
eyes
and
they
fancied
if
they
stretched
out
their
hands
they
could
seize
it
the
next
day
the
of
november
at
five
in
the
morning
all
three
were
on
foot
that
day
was
to
be
the
last
of
their
journey
if
all
calculations
were
true
that
very
night
at
twelve
in
eighteen
hours
exactly
at
the
full
moon
they
would
reach
its
brilliant
disc
the
next
midnight
would
see
that
journey
ended
the
most
extraordinary
of
ancient
or
modern
times
thus
from
the
first
of
the
morning
through
the
scuttles
silvered
by
its
rays
they
saluted
the
orb
of
night
with
a
confident
and
joyous
hurrah
the
moon
was
advancing
majestically
along
the
starry
firmament
a
few
more
degrees
and
she
would
reach
the
exact
point
where
her
meeting
with
the
projectile
was
to
take
place
according
to
his
own
observations
barbicane
reckoned
that
they
would
land
on
her
northern
hemisphere
where
stretch
immense
plains
and
where
mountains
are
rare
a
favorable
circumstance
if
as
they
thought
the
lunar
atmosphere
was
stored
only
in
its
depths
besides
observed
michel
ardan
a
plain
is
easier
to
disembark
upon
than
a
mountain
a
selenite
deposited
in
europe
on
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
or
in
asia
on
the
top
of
the
himalayas
would
not
be
quite
in
the
right
place
and
added
captain
nicholl
on
a
flat
ground
the
projectile
will
remain
motionless
when
it
has
once
touched
whereas
on
a
declivity
it
would
roll
like
an
avalanche
and
not
being
squirrels
we
should
not
come
out
safe
and
sound
so
it
is
all
for
the
best
indeed
the
success
of
the
audacious
attempt
no
longer
appeared
doubtful
but
barbicane
was
preoccupied
with
one
thought
but
not
wishing
to
make
his
companions
uneasy
he
kept
silence
on
this
subject
the
direction
the
projectile
was
taking
toward
the
northern
hemisphere
showed
that
her
course
had
been
slightly
altered
the
discharge
mathematically
calculated
would
carry
the
projectile
to
the
very
center
of
the
lunar
disc
if
it
did
not
land
there
there
must
have
been
some
deviation
what
had
caused
it
barbicane
could
neither
imagine
nor
determine
the
importance
of
the
deviation
for
there
were
no
points
to
go
by
he
hoped
however
that
it
would
have
no
other
result
than
that
of
bringing
them
nearer
the
upper
border
of
the
moon
a
region
more
suitable
for
landing
without
imparting
his
uneasiness
to
his
companions
barbicane
contented
himself
with
constantly
observing
the
moon
in
order
to
see
whether
the
course
of
the
projectile
would
not
be
altered
for
the
situation
would
have
been
terrible
if
it
failed
in
its
aim
and
being
carried
beyond
the
disc
should
be
launched
into
interplanetary
space
at
that
moment
the
moon
instead
of
appearing
flat
like
a
disc
showed
its
convexity
if
the
rays
had
struck
it
obliquely
the
shadow
thrown
would
have
brought
out
the
high
mountains
which
would
have
been
clearly
detached
the
eye
might
have
gazed
into
the
crater
gaping
abysses
and
followed
the
capricious
fissures
which
wound
through
the
immense
plains
but
all
relief
was
as
yet
leveled
in
intense
brilliancy
they
could
scarcely
distinguish
those
large
spots
which
give
the
moon
the
appearance
of
a
human
face
face
indeed
said
michel
ardan
but
i
am
sorry
for
the
amiable
sister
of
apollo
a
very
pitted
face
but
the
travelers
now
so
near
the
end
were
incessantly
observing
this
new
world
they
imagined
themselves
walking
through
its
unknown
countries
climbing
its
highest
peaks
descending
into
its
lowest
depths
here
and
there
they
fancied
they
saw
vast
seas
scarcely
kept
together
under
so
rarefied
an
atmosphere
and
emptying
the
mountain
tributaries
leaning
over
the
abyss
they
hoped
to
catch
some
sounds
from
that
orb
forever
mute
in
the
solitude
of
space
that
last
day
left
them
they
took
down
the
most
trifling
details
a
vague
uneasiness
took
possession
of
them
as
they
neared
the
end
this
uneasiness
would
have
been
doubled
had
they
felt
how
their
speed
had
decreased
it
would
have
seemed
to
them
quite
insufficient
to
carry
them
to
the
end
it
was
because
the
projectile
then
weighed
almost
nothing
its
weight
was
ever
decreasing
and
would
be
entirely
annihilated
on
that
line
where
the
lunar
and
terrestrial
attractions
would
neutralize
each
other
but
in
spite
of
his
preoccupation
michel
ardan
did
not
forget
to
prepare
the
morning
repast
with
his
accustomed
punctuality
they
ate
with
a
good
appetite
nothing
was
so
excellent
as
the
soup
liquefied
by
the
heat
of
the
gas
nothing
better
than
the
preserved
meat
some
glasses
of
good
french
wine
crowned
the
repast
causing
michel
ardan
to
remark
that
the
lunar
vines
warmed
by
that
ardent
sun
ought
to
distill
even
more
generous
wines
that
is
if
they
existed
in
any
case
the
frenchman
had
taken
care
not
to
forget
in
his
collection
some
precious
cuttings
of
the
medoc
and
cote
upon
which
he
founded
his
hopes
reiset
and
regnaut
apparatus
worked
with
great
regularity
not
an
atom
of
carbonic
acid
resisted
the
potash
and
as
to
the
oxygen
captain
nicholl
said
it
was
of
the
first
quality
the
little
watery
vapor
enclosed
in
the
projectile
mixing
with
the
air
tempered
the
dryness
and
many
apartments
in
london
paris
or
new
york
and
many
theaters
were
certainly
not
in
such
a
healthy
condition
but
that
it
might
act
with
regularity
the
apparatus
must
be
kept
in
perfect
order
so
each
morning
michel
visited
the
escape
regulators
tried
the
taps
and
regulated
the
heat
of
the
gas
by
the
pyrometer
everything
had
gone
well
up
to
that
time
and
the
travelers
imitating
the
worthy
joseph
maston
began
to
acquire
a
degree
of
embonpoint
which
would
have
rendered
them
unrecognizable
if
their
imprisonment
had
been
prolonged
to
some
months
in
a
word
they
behaved
like
chickens
in
a
coop
they
were
getting
fat
in
looking
through
the
scuttle
barbicane
saw
the
specter
of
the
dog
and
other
divers
objects
which
had
been
thrown
from
the
projectile
obstinately
following
them
diana
howled
lugubriously
on
seeing
the
remains
of
satellite
which
seemed
as
motionless
as
if
they
reposed
on
solid
earth
do
you
know
my
friends
said
michel
ardan
that
if
one
of
us
had
succumbed
to
the
shock
consequent
on
departure
we
should
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
bury
him
what
am
i
saying
to
him
as
here
ether
takes
the
place
of
earth
you
see
the
accusing
body
would
have
followed
us
into
space
like
a
remorse
that
would
have
been
sad
said
nicholl
ah
continued
michel
what
i
regret
is
not
being
able
to
take
a
walk
outside
what
voluptuousness
to
float
amid
this
radiant
ether
to
bathe
oneself
in
it
to
wrap
oneself
in
the
sun
pure
rays
if
barbicane
had
only
thought
of
furnishing
us
with
a
diving
apparatus
and
an
i
could
have
ventured
out
and
assumed
fanciful
attitudes
of
feigned
monsters
on
the
top
of
the
projectile
well
old
michel
replied
barbicane
you
would
not
have
made
a
feigned
monster
long
for
in
spite
of
your
diver
dress
swollen
by
the
expansion
of
air
within
you
you
would
have
burst
like
a
shell
or
rather
like
a
balloon
which
has
risen
too
high
so
do
not
regret
it
and
do
not
forget
this
as
long
as
we
float
in
space
all
sentimental
walks
beyond
the
projectile
are
forbidden
michel
ardan
allowed
himself
to
be
convinced
to
a
certain
extent
he
admitted
that
the
thing
was
difficult
but
not
impossible
a
word
which
he
never
uttered
the
conversation
passed
from
this
subject
to
another
not
failing
him
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
the
three
friends
as
though
under
present
conditions
ideas
shot
up
in
their
brains
as
leaves
shoot
at
the
first
warmth
of
spring
they
felt
bewildered
in
the
middle
of
the
questions
and
answers
which
crossed
each
other
nicholl
put
one
question
which
did
not
find
an
immediate
solution
ah
indeed
said
he
it
is
all
very
well
to
go
to
the
moon
but
how
to
get
back
again
his
two
interlocutors
looked
surprised
one
would
have
thought
that
this
possibility
now
occurred
to
them
for
the
first
time
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nicholl
asked
barbicane
gravely
to
ask
for
means
to
leave
a
country
added
michel
when
we
have
not
yet
arrived
there
seems
to
me
rather
inopportune
i
do
not
say
that
wishing
to
draw
back
replied
nicholl
but
i
repeat
my
question
and
i
ask
shall
we
return
i
know
nothing
about
it
answered
barbicane
and
i
said
michel
if
i
had
known
how
to
return
i
would
never
have
started
there
an
answer
cried
nicholl
i
quite
approve
of
michel
words
said
barbicane
and
add
that
the
question
has
no
real
interest
later
when
we
think
it
is
advisable
to
return
we
will
take
counsel
together
if
the
columbiad
is
not
there
the
projectile
will
be
that
is
a
step
certainly
a
ball
without
a
gun
the
gun
replied
barbicane
can
be
manufactured
the
powder
can
be
made
neither
metals
saltpeter
nor
coal
can
fail
in
the
depths
of
the
moon
and
we
need
only
go
leagues
in
order
to
fall
upon
the
terrestrial
globe
by
virtue
of
the
mere
laws
of
weight
enough
said
michel
with
animation
let
it
be
no
longer
a
question
of
returning
we
have
already
entertained
it
too
long
as
to
communicating
with
our
former
earthly
colleagues
that
will
not
be
difficult
and
how
by
means
of
meteors
launched
by
lunar
volcanoes
well
thought
of
michel
said
barbicane
in
a
convinced
tone
of
voice
laplace
has
calculated
that
a
force
five
times
greater
than
that
of
our
gun
would
suffice
to
send
a
meteor
from
the
moon
to
the
earth
and
there
is
not
one
volcano
which
has
not
a
greater
power
of
propulsion
than
that
hurrah
exclaimed
michel
these
meteors
are
handy
postmen
and
cost
nothing
and
how
we
shall
be
able
to
laugh
at
the
administration
but
now
i
think
of
it
what
do
you
think
of
a
capital
idea
why
did
we
not
fasten
a
thread
to
our
projectile
and
we
could
have
exchanged
telegrams
with
the
earth
the
deuce
answered
nicholl
do
you
consider
the
weight
of
a
thread
miles
long
nothing
as
nothing
they
could
have
trebled
the
columbiad
charge
they
could
have
quadrupled
or
quintupled
it
exclaimed
michel
with
whom
the
verb
took
a
higher
intonation
each
time
there
is
but
one
little
objection
to
make
to
your
proposition
replied
barbicane
which
is
that
during
the
rotary
motion
of
the
globe
our
thread
would
have
wound
itself
round
it
like
a
chain
on
a
capstan
and
that
it
would
inevitably
have
brought
us
to
the
ground
by
the
stars
of
the
union
said
michel
i
have
nothing
but
impracticable
ideas
ideas
worthy
of
maston
but
i
have
a
notion
that
if
we
do
not
return
to
earth
maston
will
be
able
to
come
to
us
yes
he
come
replied
barbicane
he
is
a
worthy
and
a
courageous
comrade
besides
what
is
easier
is
not
the
columbiad
still
buried
in
the
soil
of
florida
is
cotton
and
nitric
acid
wanted
wherewith
to
manufacture
the
pyroxyle
will
not
the
moon
pass
the
zenith
of
florida
in
eighteen
years
time
will
she
not
occupy
exactly
the
same
place
as
yes
continued
michel
yes
maston
will
come
and
with
him
our
friends
elphinstone
blomsberry
all
the
members
of
the
gun
club
and
they
will
be
well
received
and
by
and
by
they
will
run
trains
of
projectiles
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
hurrah
for
t
maston
it
is
probable
that
if
the
hon
maston
did
not
hear
the
hurrahs
uttered
in
his
honor
his
ears
at
least
tingled
what
was
he
doing
then
doubtless
posted
in
the
rocky
mountains
at
the
station
of
long
peak
he
was
trying
to
find
the
invisible
projectile
gravitating
in
space
if
he
was
thinking
of
his
dear
companions
we
must
allow
that
they
were
not
far
behind
him
and
that
under
the
influence
of
a
strange
excitement
they
were
devoting
to
him
their
best
thoughts
but
whence
this
excitement
which
was
evidently
growing
upon
the
tenants
of
the
projectile
their
sobriety
could
not
be
doubted
this
strange
irritation
of
the
brain
must
it
be
attributed
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
under
which
they
found
themselves
to
their
proximity
to
the
orb
of
night
from
which
only
a
few
hours
separated
them
to
some
secret
influence
of
the
moon
acting
upon
their
nervous
system
their
faces
were
as
rosy
as
if
they
had
been
exposed
to
the
roaring
flames
of
an
oven
their
voices
resounded
in
loud
accents
their
words
escaped
like
a
champagne
cork
driven
out
by
carbonic
acid
their
gestures
became
annoying
they
wanted
so
much
room
to
perform
them
and
strange
to
say
they
none
of
them
noticed
this
great
tension
of
the
mind
now
said
nicholl
in
a
short
tone
now
that
i
do
not
know
whether
we
shall
ever
return
from
the
moon
i
want
to
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
there
what
we
are
going
to
do
there
replied
barbicane
stamping
with
his
foot
as
if
he
was
in
a
fencing
saloon
i
do
not
know
you
do
not
know
exclaimed
michel
with
a
bellow
which
provoked
a
sonorous
echo
in
the
projectile
no
i
have
not
even
thought
about
it
retorted
barbicane
in
the
same
loud
tone
well
i
know
replied
michel
speak
then
cried
nicholl
who
could
no
longer
contain
the
growling
of
his
voice
i
shall
speak
if
it
suits
me
exclaimed
michel
seizing
his
companions
arms
with
violence
suit
you
said
barbicane
with
an
eye
on
fire
and
a
threatening
hand
it
was
you
who
drew
us
into
this
frightful
journey
and
we
want
to
know
what
for
yes
said
the
captain
now
that
i
do
not
know
i
am
going
i
want
to
know
i
am
going
why
exclaimed
michel
jumping
a
yard
high
why
to
take
possession
of
the
moon
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
add
a
fortieth
state
to
the
union
to
colonize
the
lunar
regions
to
cultivate
them
to
people
them
to
transport
thither
all
the
prodigies
of
art
of
science
and
industry
to
civilize
the
selenites
unless
they
are
more
civilized
than
we
are
and
to
constitute
them
a
republic
if
they
are
not
already
one
and
if
there
are
no
selenites
retorted
nicholl
who
under
the
influence
of
this
unaccountable
intoxication
was
very
contradictory
who
said
that
there
were
no
selenites
exclaimed
michel
in
a
threatening
tone
i
do
howled
nicholl
captain
said
michel
do
not
repreat
that
insolence
or
i
will
knock
your
teeth
down
your
throat
the
two
adversaries
were
going
to
fall
upon
each
other
and
the
incoherent
discussion
threatened
to
merge
into
a
fight
when
barbicane
intervened
with
one
bound
stop
miserable
men
said
he
separating
his
two
companions
if
there
are
no
selenites
we
will
do
without
them
yes
exclaimed
michel
who
was
not
particular
yes
we
will
do
without
them
we
have
only
to
make
selenites
down
with
the
selenites
the
empire
of
the
moon
belongs
to
us
said
nicholl
let
us
three
constitute
the
republic
i
will
be
the
congress
cried
michel
and
i
the
senate
retorted
nicholl
and
barbicane
the
president
howled
michel
not
a
president
elected
by
the
nation
replied
barbicane
very
well
a
president
elected
by
the
congress
cried
michel
and
as
i
am
the
congress
you
are
unanimously
elected
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
for
president
barbicane
exclaimed
nicholl
hip
hip
hip
vociferated
michel
ardan
then
the
president
and
the
senate
struck
up
in
a
tremendous
voice
the
popular
song
yankee
doodle
while
from
the
congress
resounded
the
masculine
tones
of
the
marseillaise
then
they
struck
up
a
frantic
dance
with
maniacal
gestures
idiotic
stampings
and
somersaults
like
those
of
the
boneless
clowns
in
the
circus
diana
joining
in
the
dance
and
howling
in
her
turn
jumped
to
the
top
of
the
projectile
an
unaccountable
flapping
of
wings
was
then
heard
amid
most
fantastic
while
five
or
six
hens
fluttered
like
bats
against
the
walls
then
the
three
traveling
companions
acted
upon
by
some
unaccountable
influence
above
that
of
intoxication
inflamed
by
the
air
which
had
set
their
respiratory
apparatus
on
fire
fell
motionless
to
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
chapter
viii
at
thousand
five
hundred
and
fourteen
leagues
what
had
happened
whence
the
cause
of
this
singular
intoxication
the
consequences
of
which
might
have
been
very
disastrous
a
simple
blunder
of
michel
which
fortunately
nicholl
was
able
to
correct
in
time
after
a
perfect
swoon
which
lasted
some
minutes
the
captain
recovering
first
soon
collected
his
scattered
senses
although
he
had
breakfasted
only
two
hours
before
he
felt
a
gnawing
hunger
as
if
he
had
not
eaten
anything
for
several
days
everything
about
him
stomach
and
brain
were
overexcited
to
the
highest
degree
he
got
up
and
demanded
from
michel
a
supplementary
repast
michel
utterly
done
up
did
not
answer
nicholl
then
tried
to
prepare
some
tea
destined
to
help
the
absorption
of
a
dozen
sandwiches
he
first
tried
to
get
some
fire
and
struck
a
match
sharply
what
was
his
surprise
to
see
the
sulphur
shine
with
so
extraordinary
a
brilliancy
as
to
be
almost
unbearable
to
the
eye
from
the
which
he
lit
rose
a
flame
equal
to
a
jet
of
electric
light
a
revelation
dawned
on
nicholl
mind
that
intensity
of
light
the
physiological
troubles
which
had
arisen
in
him
the
overexcitement
of
all
his
moral
and
quarrelsome
faculties
he
understood
all
the
oxygen
he
exclaimed
and
leaning
over
the
air
apparatus
he
saw
that
the
tap
was
allowing
the
colorless
gas
to
escape
freely
but
in
its
pure
state
producing
the
gravest
disorders
in
the
system
michel
had
blunderingly
opened
the
tap
of
the
apparatus
to
the
full
nicholl
hastened
to
stop
the
escape
of
oxygen
with
which
the
atmosphere
was
saturated
which
would
have
been
the
death
of
the
travelers
not
by
suffocation
but
by
combustion
an
hour
later
the
air
less
charged
with
it
restored
the
lungs
to
their
normal
condition
by
degrees
the
three
friends
recovered
from
their
intoxication
but
they
were
obliged
to
sleep
themselves
sober
over
their
oxygen
as
a
drunkard
does
over
his
wine
when
michel
learned
his
share
of
the
responsibility
of
this
incident
he
was
not
much
disconcerted
this
unexpected
drunkenness
broke
the
monotony
of
the
journey
many
foolish
things
had
been
said
while
under
its
influence
but
also
quickly
forgotten
and
then
added
the
merry
frenchman
i
am
not
sorry
to
have
tasted
a
little
of
this
heady
gas
do
you
know
my
friends
that
a
curious
establishment
might
be
founded
with
rooms
of
oxygen
where
people
whose
system
is
weakened
could
for
a
few
hours
live
a
more
active
life
fancy
parties
where
the
room
was
saturated
with
this
heroic
fluid
theaters
where
it
should
be
kept
at
high
pressure
what
passion
in
the
souls
of
the
actors
and
spectators
what
fire
what
enthusiasm
and
if
instead
of
an
assembly
only
a
whole
people
could
be
saturated
what
activity
in
its
functions
what
a
supplement
to
life
it
would
derive
from
an
exhausted
nation
they
might
make
a
great
and
strong
one
and
i
know
more
than
one
state
in
old
europe
which
ought
to
put
itself
under
the
regime
of
oxygen
for
the
sake
of
its
health
michel
spoke
with
so
much
animation
that
one
might
have
fancied
that
the
tap
was
still
too
open
but
a
few
words
from
barbicane
soon
shattered
his
enthusiasm
that
is
all
very
well
friend
michel
said
he
but
will
you
inform
us
where
these
chickens
came
from
which
have
mixed
themselves
up
in
our
concert
those
chickens
yes
indeed
half
a
dozen
chickens
and
a
fine
cock
were
walking
about
flapping
their
wings
and
chattering
ah
the
awkward
things
exclaimed
michel
the
oxygen
has
made
them
revolt
but
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
these
chickens
asked
barbicane
to
acclimatize
them
in
the
moon
by
jove
then
why
did
you
hide
them
a
joke
my
worthy
president
a
simple
joke
which
has
proved
a
miserable
failure
i
wanted
to
set
them
free
on
the
lunar
continent
without
saying
anything
oh
what
would
have
been
your
amazement
on
seeing
these
animals
pecking
in
your
lunar
fields
you
rascal
you
unmitigated
rascal
replied
barbicane
you
do
not
want
oxygen
to
mount
to
the
head
you
are
always
what
we
were
under
the
influence
of
the
gas
you
are
always
foolish
ah
who
says
that
we
were
not
wise
then
replied
michel
ardan
after
this
philosophical
reflection
the
three
friends
set
about
restoring
the
order
of
the
projectile
chickens
and
cock
were
reinstated
in
their
coop
but
while
proceeding
with
this
operation
barbicane
and
his
two
companions
had
a
most
desired
perception
of
a
new
phenomenon
from
the
moment
of
leaving
the
earth
their
own
weight
that
of
the
projectile
and
the
objects
it
enclosed
had
been
subject
to
an
increasing
diminution
if
they
could
not
prove
this
loss
of
the
projectile
a
moment
would
arrive
when
it
would
be
sensibly
felt
upon
themselves
and
the
utensils
and
instruments
they
used
it
is
needless
to
say
that
a
scale
would
not
show
this
loss
for
the
weight
destined
to
weight
the
object
would
have
lost
exactly
as
much
as
the
object
itself
but
a
spring
steelyard
for
example
the
tension
of
which
was
independent
of
the
attraction
would
have
given
a
just
estimate
of
this
loss
we
know
that
the
attraction
otherwise
called
the
weight
is
in
proportion
to
the
densities
of
the
bodies
and
inversely
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
hence
this
effect
if
the
earth
had
been
alone
in
space
if
the
other
celestial
bodies
had
been
suddenly
annihilated
the
projectile
according
to
laws
would
weigh
less
as
it
got
farther
from
the
earth
but
without
ever
losing
its
weight
entirely
for
the
terrestrial
attraction
would
always
have
made
itself
felt
at
whatever
distance
but
in
reality
a
time
must
come
when
the
projectile
would
no
longer
be
subject
to
the
law
of
weight
after
allowing
for
the
other
celestial
bodies
whose
effect
could
not
be
set
down
as
zero
indeed
the
projectile
course
was
being
traced
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
as
it
distanced
the
earth
the
terrestrial
attraction
diminished
but
the
lunar
attraction
rose
in
proportion
there
must
come
a
point
where
these
two
attractions
would
neutralize
each
other
the
projectile
would
possess
weight
no
longer
if
the
moon
and
the
densities
had
been
equal
this
point
would
have
been
at
an
equal
distance
between
the
two
orbs
but
taking
the
different
densities
into
consideration
it
was
easy
to
reckon
that
this
point
would
be
situated
at
of
the
whole
journey
at
leagues
from
the
earth
at
this
point
a
body
having
no
principle
of
speed
or
displacement
in
itself
would
remain
immovable
forever
being
attracted
equally
by
both
orbs
and
not
being
drawn
more
toward
one
than
toward
the
other
now
if
the
projectile
impulsive
force
had
been
correctly
calculated
it
would
attain
this
point
without
speed
having
lost
all
trace
of
weight
as
well
as
all
the
objects
within
it
what
would
happen
then
three
hypotheses
presented
themselves
either
it
would
retain
a
certain
amount
of
motion
and
pass
the
point
of
equal
attraction
and
fall
upon
the
moon
by
virtue
of
the
excess
of
the
lunar
attraction
over
the
terrestrial
or
its
speed
failing
and
unable
to
reach
the
point
of
equal
attraction
it
would
fall
upon
the
moon
by
virtue
of
the
excess
of
the
lunar
attraction
over
the
terrestrial
or
lastly
animated
with
sufficient
speed
to
enable
it
to
reach
the
neutral
point
but
not
sufficient
to
pass
it
it
would
remain
forever
suspended
in
that
spot
like
the
pretended
tomb
of
mahomet
between
the
zenith
and
the
nadir
such
was
their
situation
and
barbicane
clearly
explained
the
consequences
to
his
traveling
companions
which
greatly
interested
them
but
how
should
they
know
when
the
projectile
had
reached
this
neutral
point
situated
at
that
distance
especially
when
neither
themselves
nor
the
objects
enclosed
in
the
projectile
would
be
any
longer
subject
to
the
laws
of
weight
up
to
this
time
the
travelers
while
admitting
that
this
action
was
constantly
decreasing
had
not
yet
become
sensible
to
its
total
absence
but
that
day
about
eleven
in
the
morning
nicholl
having
accidentally
let
a
glass
slip
from
his
hand
the
glass
instead
of
falling
remained
suspended
in
the
air
ah
exclaimed
michel
ardan
that
is
rather
an
amusing
piece
of
natural
philosophy
and
immediately
divers
other
objects
firearms
and
bottles
abandoned
to
themselves
held
themselves
up
as
by
enchantment
diana
too
placed
in
space
by
michel
reproduced
but
without
any
trick
the
wonderful
suspension
practiced
by
caston
and
robert
houdin
indeed
the
dog
did
not
seem
to
know
that
she
was
floating
in
air
the
three
adventurous
companions
were
surprised
and
stupefied
despite
their
scientific
reasonings
they
felt
themselves
being
carried
into
the
domain
of
wonders
they
felt
that
weight
was
really
wanting
to
their
bodies
if
they
stretched
out
their
arms
they
did
not
attempt
to
fall
their
heads
shook
on
their
shoulders
their
feet
no
longer
clung
to
the
floor
of
the
projectile
they
were
like
drunken
men
having
no
stability
in
themselves
fancy
has
depicted
men
without
reflection
others
without
shadow
but
here
reality
by
the
neutralizations
of
attractive
forces
produced
men
in
whom
nothing
had
any
weight
and
who
weighed
nothing
themselves
suddenly
michel
taking
a
spring
left
the
floor
and
remained
suspended
in
the
air
like
murillo
monk
of
the
des
the
two
friends
joined
him
instantly
and
all
three
formed
a
miraculous
ascension
in
the
center
of
the
projectile
is
it
to
be
believed
is
it
probable
is
it
possible
exclaimed
michel
and
yet
it
is
so
ah
if
raphael
had
seen
us
thus
what
an
he
would
have
thrown
upon
canvas
the
can
not
last
replied
barbicane
if
the
projectile
passes
the
neutral
point
the
lunar
attraction
will
draw
us
to
the
moon
then
our
feet
will
be
upon
the
roof
replied
michel
no
said
barbicane
because
the
projectile
center
of
gravity
is
very
low
it
will
only
turn
by
degrees
then
all
our
portables
will
be
upset
from
top
to
bottom
that
is
a
fact
calm
yourself
michel
replied
nicholl
no
upset
is
to
be
feared
not
a
thing
will
move
for
the
projectile
evolution
will
be
imperceptible
just
so
continued
barbicane
and
when
it
has
passed
the
point
of
equal
attraction
its
base
being
the
heavier
will
draw
it
perpendicularly
to
the
moon
but
in
order
that
this
phenomenon
should
take
place
we
must
have
passed
the
neutral
line
pass
the
neutral
line
cried
michel
then
let
us
do
as
the
sailors
do
when
they
cross
the
equator
a
slight
side
movement
brought
michel
back
toward
the
padded
side
thence
he
took
a
bottle
and
glasses
placed
them
in
space
before
his
companions
and
drinking
merrily
they
saluted
the
line
with
a
triple
hurrah
the
influence
of
these
attractions
scarcely
lasted
an
hour
the
travelers
felt
themselves
insensibly
drawn
toward
the
floor
and
barbicane
fancied
that
the
conical
end
of
the
projectile
was
varying
a
little
from
its
normal
direction
toward
the
moon
by
an
inverse
motion
the
base
was
approaching
first
the
lunar
attraction
was
prevailing
over
the
terrestrial
the
fall
toward
the
moon
was
beginning
almost
imperceptibly
as
yet
but
by
degrees
the
attractive
force
would
become
stronger
the
fall
would
be
more
decided
the
projectile
drawn
by
its
base
would
turn
its
cone
to
the
earth
and
fall
with
speed
on
to
the
surface
of
the
selenite
continent
their
destination
would
then
be
attained
now
nothing
could
prevent
the
success
of
their
enterprise
and
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
shared
barbicane
joy
then
they
chatted
of
all
the
phenomena
which
had
astonished
them
one
after
the
other
particularly
the
neutralization
of
the
laws
of
weight
michel
ardan
always
enthusiastic
drew
conclusions
which
were
purely
fanciful
ah
my
worthy
friends
he
exclaimed
what
progress
we
should
make
if
on
earth
we
could
throw
off
some
of
that
weight
some
of
that
chain
which
binds
us
to
her
it
would
be
the
prisoner
set
at
liberty
no
more
fatigue
of
either
arms
or
legs
or
if
it
is
true
that
in
order
to
fly
on
the
earth
surface
to
keep
oneself
suspended
in
the
air
merely
by
the
play
of
the
muscles
there
requires
a
strength
a
hundred
and
fifty
times
greater
than
that
which
we
possess
a
simple
act
of
volition
a
caprice
would
bear
us
into
space
if
attraction
did
not
exist
just
so
said
nicholl
smiling
if
we
could
succeed
in
suppressing
weight
as
they
suppress
pain
by
anaesthesia
that
would
change
the
face
of
modern
society
yes
cried
michel
full
of
his
subject
destroy
weight
and
no
more
burdens
well
said
replied
barbicane
but
if
nothing
had
any
weight
nothing
would
keep
in
its
place
not
even
your
hat
on
your
head
worthy
michel
nor
your
house
whose
stones
only
adhere
by
weight
nor
a
boat
whose
stability
on
the
waves
is
only
caused
by
weight
not
even
the
ocean
whose
waves
would
no
longer
be
equalized
by
terrestrial
attraction
and
lastly
not
even
the
atmosphere
whose
atoms
being
no
longer
held
in
their
places
would
disperse
in
space
that
is
tiresome
retorted
michel
nothing
like
these
people
for
bringing
one
back
to
the
bare
reality
but
console
yourself
michel
continued
barbicane
for
if
no
orb
exists
from
whence
all
laws
of
weight
are
banished
you
are
at
least
going
to
visit
one
where
it
is
much
less
than
on
the
earth
the
moon
yes
the
moon
on
whose
surface
objects
weigh
six
times
less
than
on
the
earth
a
phenomenon
easy
to
prove
and
we
shall
feel
it
asked
michel
evidently
as
two
hundred
pounds
will
only
weigh
thirty
pounds
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
our
muscular
strength
will
not
diminish
not
at
all
instead
of
jumping
one
yard
high
you
will
rise
eighteen
feet
high
but
we
shall
be
regular
herculeses
in
the
moon
exclaimed
michel
yes
replied
nicholl
for
if
the
height
of
the
selenites
is
in
proportion
to
the
density
of
their
globe
they
will
be
scarcely
a
foot
high
lilliputians
ejaculated
michel
i
shall
play
the
part
of
gulliver
we
are
going
to
realize
the
fable
of
the
giants
this
is
the
advantage
of
leaving
one
own
planet
and
the
solar
world
one
moment
michel
answered
barbicane
if
you
wish
to
play
the
part
of
gulliver
only
visit
the
inferior
planets
such
as
mercury
venus
or
mars
whose
density
is
a
little
less
than
that
of
the
earth
but
do
not
venture
into
the
great
planets
jupiter
saturn
uranus
neptune
for
there
the
order
will
be
changed
and
you
will
become
lilliputian
and
in
the
sun
in
the
sun
if
its
density
is
thirteen
hundred
and
thousand
times
greater
and
the
attraction
is
times
greater
than
on
the
surface
of
our
globe
keeping
everything
in
proportion
the
inhabitants
ought
to
be
at
least
two
hundred
feet
high
by
jove
exclaimed
michel
i
should
be
nothing
more
than
a
pigmy
a
shrimp
gulliver
with
the
giants
said
nicholl
just
so
replied
barbicane
and
it
would
not
be
quite
useless
to
carry
some
pieces
of
artillery
to
defend
oneself
good
replied
nicholl
your
projectiles
would
have
no
effect
on
the
sun
they
would
fall
back
upon
the
earth
after
some
minutes
that
is
a
strong
remark
it
is
certain
replied
barbicane
the
attraction
is
so
great
on
this
enormous
orb
that
an
object
weighing
pounds
on
the
earth
would
weigh
but
pounds
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
if
you
were
to
fall
upon
it
you
would
weigh
let
me
see
about
pounds
a
weight
which
you
would
never
be
able
to
raise
again
the
devil
said
michel
one
would
want
a
portable
crane
however
we
will
be
satisfied
with
the
moon
for
the
present
there
at
least
we
shall
cut
a
great
figure
we
will
see
about
the
sun
by
and
by
chapter
ix
the
consequences
of
a
deviation
barbicane
had
now
no
fear
of
the
issue
of
the
journey
at
least
as
far
as
the
projectile
impulsive
force
was
concerned
its
own
speed
would
carry
it
beyond
the
neutral
line
it
would
certainly
not
return
to
earth
it
would
certainly
not
remain
motionless
on
the
line
of
attraction
one
single
hypothesis
remained
to
be
realized
the
arrival
of
the
projectile
at
its
destination
by
the
action
of
the
lunar
attraction
it
was
in
reality
a
fall
of
leagues
on
an
orb
it
is
true
where
weight
could
only
be
reckoned
at
one
sixth
of
terrestrial
weight
a
formidable
fall
nevertheless
and
one
against
which
every
precaution
must
be
taken
without
delay
these
precautions
were
of
two
sorts
some
to
deaden
the
shock
when
the
projectile
should
touch
the
lunar
soil
others
to
delay
the
fall
and
consequently
make
it
less
violent
to
deaden
the
shock
it
was
a
pity
that
barbicane
was
no
longer
able
to
employ
the
means
which
had
so
ably
weakened
the
shock
at
departure
that
is
to
say
by
water
used
as
springs
and
the
partition
breaks
the
partitions
still
existed
but
water
failed
for
they
could
not
use
their
reserve
which
was
precious
in
case
during
the
first
days
the
liquid
element
should
be
found
wanting
on
lunar
soil
and
indeed
this
reserve
would
have
been
quite
insufficient
for
a
spring
the
layer
of
water
stored
in
the
projectile
at
the
time
of
starting
upon
their
journey
occupied
no
less
than
three
feet
in
depth
and
spread
over
a
surface
of
not
less
than
square
feet
besides
the
cistern
did
not
contain
part
of
it
they
must
therefore
give
up
this
efficient
means
of
deadening
the
shock
of
arrival
happily
barbicane
not
content
with
employing
water
had
furnished
the
movable
disc
with
strong
spring
plugs
destined
to
lessen
the
shock
against
the
base
after
the
breaking
of
the
horizontal
partitions
these
plugs
still
existed
they
had
only
to
readjust
them
and
replace
the
movable
disc
every
piece
easy
to
handle
as
their
weight
was
now
scarcely
felt
was
quickly
mounted
the
different
pieces
were
fitted
without
trouble
it
being
only
a
matter
of
bolts
and
screws
tools
were
not
wanting
and
soon
the
reinstated
disc
lay
on
steel
plugs
like
a
table
on
its
legs
one
inconvenience
resulted
from
the
replacing
of
the
disc
the
lower
window
was
blocked
up
thus
it
was
impossible
for
the
travelers
to
observe
the
moon
from
that
opening
while
they
were
being
precipitated
perpendicularly
upon
her
but
they
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
even
by
the
side
openings
they
could
still
see
vast
lunar
regions
as
an
aeronaut
sees
the
earth
from
his
car
this
replacing
of
the
disc
was
at
least
an
hour
work
it
was
past
twelve
when
all
preparations
were
finished
barbicane
took
fresh
observations
on
the
inclination
of
the
projectile
but
to
his
annoyance
it
had
not
turned
over
sufficiently
for
its
fall
it
seemed
to
take
a
curve
parallel
to
the
lunar
disc
the
orb
of
night
shone
splendidly
into
space
while
opposite
the
orb
of
day
blazed
with
fire
their
situation
began
to
make
them
uneasy
are
we
reaching
our
destination
said
nicholl
let
us
act
as
if
we
were
about
reaching
it
replied
barbicane
you
are
sceptical
retorted
michel
ardan
we
shall
arrive
and
that
too
quicker
than
we
like
this
answer
brought
barbicane
back
to
his
preparations
and
he
occupied
himself
with
placing
the
contrivances
intended
to
break
their
descent
we
may
remember
the
scene
of
the
meeting
held
at
tampa
town
in
florida
when
captain
nicholl
came
forward
as
barbicane
enemy
and
michel
ardan
adversary
to
captain
nicholl
maintaining
that
the
projectile
would
smash
like
glass
michel
replied
that
he
would
break
their
fall
by
means
of
rockets
properly
placed
thus
powerful
fireworks
taking
their
from
the
base
and
bursting
outside
could
by
producing
a
recoil
check
to
a
certain
degree
the
projectile
speed
these
rockets
were
to
burn
in
space
it
is
true
but
oxygen
would
not
fail
them
for
they
could
supply
themselves
with
it
like
the
lunar
volcanoes
the
burning
of
which
has
never
yet
been
stopped
by
the
want
of
atmosphere
round
the
moon
barbicane
had
accordingly
supplied
himself
with
these
fireworks
enclosed
in
little
steel
guns
which
could
be
screwed
on
to
the
base
of
the
projectile
inside
these
guns
were
flush
with
the
bottom
outside
they
protruded
about
eighteen
inches
there
were
twenty
of
them
an
opening
left
in
the
disc
allowed
them
to
light
the
match
with
which
each
was
provided
all
the
effect
was
felt
outside
the
burning
mixture
had
already
been
rammed
into
each
gun
they
had
then
nothing
to
do
but
raise
the
metallic
buffers
fixed
in
the
base
and
replace
them
by
the
guns
which
fitted
closely
in
their
places
this
new
work
was
finished
about
three
and
after
taking
all
these
precautions
there
remained
but
to
wait
but
the
projectile
was
perceptibly
nearing
the
moon
and
evidently
succumbed
to
her
influence
to
a
certain
degree
though
its
own
velocity
also
drew
it
in
an
oblique
direction
from
these
conflicting
influences
resulted
a
line
which
might
become
a
tangent
but
it
was
certain
that
the
projectile
would
not
fall
directly
on
the
moon
for
its
lower
part
by
reason
of
its
weight
ought
to
be
turned
toward
her
barbicane
uneasiness
increased
as
he
saw
his
projectile
resist
the
influence
of
gravitation
the
unknown
was
opening
before
him
the
unknown
in
interplanetary
space
the
man
of
science
thought
he
had
foreseen
the
only
three
hypotheses
possible
the
return
to
the
earth
the
return
to
the
moon
or
stagnation
on
the
neutral
line
and
here
a
fourth
hypothesis
big
with
all
the
terrors
of
the
infinite
surged
up
inopportunely
to
face
it
without
flinching
one
must
be
a
resolute
savant
like
barbicane
a
phlegmatic
being
like
nicholl
or
an
audacious
adventurer
like
michel
ardan
conversation
was
started
upon
this
subject
other
men
would
have
considered
the
question
from
a
practical
point
of
view
they
would
have
asked
themselves
whither
their
projectile
carriage
was
carrying
them
not
so
with
these
they
sought
for
the
cause
which
produced
this
effect
so
we
have
become
diverted
from
our
route
said
michel
but
why
i
very
much
fear
answered
nicholl
that
in
spite
of
all
precautions
taken
the
columbiad
was
not
fairly
pointed
an
error
however
small
would
be
enough
to
throw
us
out
of
the
moon
attraction
then
they
must
have
aimed
badly
asked
michel
i
do
not
think
so
replied
barbicane
the
perpendicularity
of
the
gun
was
exact
its
direction
to
the
zenith
of
the
spot
incontestible
and
the
moon
passing
to
the
zenith
of
the
spot
we
ought
to
reach
it
at
the
full
there
is
another
reason
but
it
escapes
me
are
we
not
arriving
too
late
asked
nicholl
too
late
said
barbicane
yes
continued
nicholl
the
cambridge
observatory
note
says
that
the
transit
ought
to
be
accomplished
in
hours
thirteen
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
which
means
to
say
that
the
moon
will
be
at
the
point
indicated
and
it
will
have
passed
it
true
replied
barbicane
but
we
started
the
of
december
at
thirteen
minutes
and
seconds
to
eleven
at
night
and
we
ought
to
arrive
on
the
at
midnight
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
moon
would
be
full
and
we
are
now
at
the
of
december
it
is
now
three
in
the
evening
eight
ought
to
see
us
at
the
end
of
our
journey
why
do
we
not
arrive
might
it
not
be
an
excess
of
speed
answered
nicholl
for
we
know
now
that
its
initial
velocity
was
greater
than
they
supposed
no
a
hundred
times
no
replied
barbicane
an
excess
of
speed
if
the
direction
of
the
projectile
had
been
right
would
not
have
prevented
us
reaching
the
moon
no
there
has
been
a
deviation
we
have
been
turned
out
of
our
course
by
whom
by
what
asked
nicholl
i
can
not
say
replied
barbicane
very
well
then
barbicane
said
michel
do
you
wish
to
know
my
opinion
on
the
subject
of
finding
out
this
deviation
speak
i
would
not
give
half
a
dollar
to
know
it
that
we
have
deviated
is
a
fact
where
we
are
going
matters
little
we
shall
soon
see
since
we
are
being
borne
along
in
space
we
shall
end
by
falling
into
some
center
of
attraction
or
other
michel
ardan
indifference
did
not
content
barbicane
not
that
he
was
uneasy
about
the
future
but
he
wanted
to
know
at
any
cost
his
projectile
had
deviated
but
the
projectile
continued
its
course
sideways
to
the
moon
and
with
it
the
mass
of
things
thrown
out
barbicane
could
even
prove
by
the
elevations
which
served
as
landmarks
upon
the
moon
which
was
only
two
thousand
leagues
distant
that
its
speed
was
becoming
uniform
fresh
proof
that
there
was
no
fall
its
impulsive
force
still
prevailed
over
the
lunar
attraction
but
the
projectile
course
was
certainly
bringing
it
nearer
to
the
moon
and
they
might
hope
that
at
a
nearer
point
the
weight
predominating
would
cause
a
decided
fall
the
three
friends
having
nothing
better
to
do
continued
their
observations
but
they
could
not
yet
determine
the
topographical
position
of
the
satellite
every
relief
was
leveled
under
the
reflection
of
the
solar
rays
they
watched
thus
through
the
side
windows
until
eight
at
night
the
moon
had
grown
so
large
in
their
eyes
that
it
filled
half
of
the
firmament
the
sun
on
one
side
and
the
orb
of
night
on
the
other
flooded
the
projectile
with
light
at
that
moment
barbicane
thought
he
could
estimate
the
distance
which
separated
them
from
their
aim
at
no
more
than
leagues
the
speed
of
the
projectile
seemed
to
him
to
be
more
than
yards
or
about
leagues
a
second
under
the
centripetal
force
the
base
of
the
projectile
tended
toward
the
moon
but
the
centrifugal
still
prevailed
and
it
was
probable
that
its
rectilineal
course
would
be
changed
to
a
curve
of
some
sort
the
nature
of
which
they
could
not
at
present
determine
barbicane
was
still
seeking
the
solution
of
his
insoluble
problem
hours
passed
without
any
result
the
projectile
was
evidently
nearing
the
moon
but
it
was
also
evident
that
it
would
never
reach
her
as
to
the
nearest
distance
at
which
it
would
pass
her
that
must
be
the
result
of
two
forces
attraction
and
repulsion
affecting
its
motion
i
ask
but
one
thing
said
michel
that
we
may
pass
near
enough
to
penetrate
her
secrets
cursed
be
the
thing
that
has
caused
our
projectile
to
deviate
from
its
course
cried
nicholl
and
as
if
a
light
had
suddenly
broken
in
upon
his
mind
barbicane
answered
then
cursed
be
the
meteor
which
crossed
our
path
what
said
michel
ardan
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
nicholl
i
mean
said
barbicane
in
a
decided
tone
i
mean
that
our
deviation
is
owing
solely
to
our
meeting
with
this
erring
body
but
it
did
not
even
brush
us
as
it
passed
said
michel
what
does
that
matter
its
mass
compared
to
that
of
our
projectile
was
enormous
and
its
attraction
was
enough
to
influence
our
course
so
little
cried
nicholl
yes
nicholl
but
however
little
it
might
be
replied
barbicane
in
a
distance
of
leagues
it
wanted
no
more
to
make
us
miss
the
moon
chapter
x
the
observers
of
the
moon
barbicane
had
evidently
hit
upon
the
only
plausible
reason
of
this
deviation
however
slight
it
might
have
been
it
had
sufficed
to
modify
the
course
of
the
projectile
it
was
a
fatality
the
bold
attempt
had
miscarried
by
a
fortuitous
circumstance
and
unless
by
some
exceptional
event
they
could
now
never
reach
the
moon
disc
would
they
pass
near
enough
to
be
able
to
solve
certain
physical
and
geological
questions
until
then
insoluble
this
was
the
question
and
the
only
one
which
occupied
the
minds
of
these
bold
travelers
as
to
the
fate
in
store
for
themselves
they
did
not
even
dream
of
it
but
what
would
become
of
them
amid
these
infinite
solitudes
these
who
would
soon
want
air
a
few
more
days
and
they
would
fall
stifled
in
this
wandering
projectile
but
some
days
to
these
intrepid
fellows
was
a
century
and
they
devoted
all
their
time
to
observe
that
moon
which
they
no
longer
hoped
to
reach
the
distance
which
had
then
separated
the
projectile
from
the
satellite
was
estimated
at
about
two
hundred
leagues
under
these
conditions
as
regards
the
visibility
of
the
details
of
the
disc
the
travelers
were
farther
from
the
moon
than
are
the
inhabitants
of
earth
with
their
powerful
telescopes
indeed
we
know
that
the
instrument
mounted
by
lord
rosse
at
parsonstown
which
magnifies
times
brings
the
moon
to
within
an
apparent
distance
of
sixteen
leagues
and
more
than
that
with
the
powerful
one
set
up
at
long
peak
the
orb
of
night
magnified
times
is
brought
to
within
less
than
two
leagues
and
objects
having
a
diameter
of
thirty
feet
are
seen
very
distinctly
so
that
at
this
distance
the
topographical
details
of
the
moon
observed
without
glasses
could
not
be
determined
with
precision
the
eye
caught
the
vast
outline
of
those
immense
depressions
inappropriately
called
seas
but
they
could
not
recognize
their
nature
the
prominence
of
the
mountains
disappeared
under
the
splendid
irradiation
produced
by
the
reflection
of
the
solar
rays
the
eye
dazzled
as
if
it
was
leaning
over
a
bath
of
molten
silver
turned
from
it
involuntarily
but
the
oblong
form
of
the
orb
was
quite
clear
it
appeared
like
a
gigantic
egg
with
the
small
end
turned
toward
the
earth
indeed
the
moon
liquid
and
pliable
in
the
first
days
of
its
formation
was
originally
a
perfect
sphere
but
being
soon
drawn
within
the
attraction
of
the
earth
it
became
elongated
under
the
influence
of
gravitation
in
becoming
a
satellite
she
lost
her
native
purity
of
form
her
center
of
gravity
was
in
advance
of
the
center
of
her
figure
and
from
this
fact
some
savants
draw
the
conclusion
that
the
air
and
water
had
taken
refuge
on
the
opposite
surface
of
the
moon
which
is
never
seen
from
the
earth
this
alteration
in
the
primitive
form
of
the
satellite
was
only
perceptible
for
a
few
moments
the
distance
of
the
projectile
from
the
moon
diminished
very
rapidly
under
its
speed
though
that
was
much
less
than
its
initial
velocity
but
eight
or
nine
times
greater
than
that
which
propels
our
express
trains
the
oblique
course
of
the
projectile
from
its
very
obliquity
gave
michel
ardan
some
hopes
of
striking
the
lunar
disc
at
some
point
or
other
he
could
not
think
that
they
would
never
reach
it
no
he
could
not
believe
it
and
this
opinion
he
often
repeated
but
barbicane
who
was
a
better
judge
always
answered
him
with
merciless
logic
no
michel
no
we
can
only
reach
the
moon
by
a
fall
and
we
are
not
falling
the
centripetal
force
keeps
us
under
the
moon
influence
but
the
centrifugal
force
draws
us
irresistibly
away
from
it
this
was
said
in
a
tone
which
quenched
michel
ardan
last
hope
the
portion
of
the
moon
which
the
projectile
was
nearing
was
the
northern
hemisphere
that
which
the
selenographic
maps
place
below
for
these
maps
are
generally
drawn
after
the
outline
given
by
the
glasses
and
we
know
that
they
reverse
the
objects
such
was
the
of
boeer
and
moedler
which
barbicane
consulted
this
northern
hemisphere
presented
vast
plains
dotted
with
isolated
mountains
at
midnight
the
moon
was
full
at
that
precise
moment
the
travelers
should
have
alighted
upon
it
if
the
mischievous
meteor
had
not
diverted
their
course
the
orb
was
exactly
in
the
condition
determined
by
the
cambridge
observatory
it
was
mathematically
at
its
perigee
and
at
the
zenith
of
the
parallel
an
observer
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
enormous
columbiad
pointed
perpendicularly
to
the
horizon
would
have
framed
the
moon
in
the
mouth
of
the
gun
a
straight
line
drawn
through
the
axis
of
the
piece
would
have
passed
through
the
center
of
the
orb
of
night
it
is
needless
to
say
that
during
the
night
of
the
of
december
the
travelers
took
not
an
instant
rest
could
they
close
their
eyes
when
so
near
this
new
world
no
all
their
feelings
were
concentrated
in
one
single
thought
see
representatives
of
the
earth
of
humanity
past
and
present
all
centered
in
them
it
is
through
their
eyes
that
the
human
race
look
at
these
lunar
regions
and
penetrate
the
secrets
of
their
satellite
a
strange
emotion
filled
their
hearts
as
they
went
from
one
window
to
the
other
their
observations
reproduced
by
barbicane
were
rigidly
determined
to
take
them
they
had
glasses
to
correct
them
maps
as
regards
the
optical
instruments
at
their
disposal
they
had
excellent
marine
glasses
specially
constructed
for
this
journey
they
possessed
magnifying
powers
of
they
would
thus
have
brought
the
moon
to
within
a
distance
apparent
of
less
than
leagues
from
the
earth
but
then
at
a
distance
which
for
three
hours
in
the
morning
did
not
exceed
miles
and
in
a
medium
free
from
all
atmospheric
disturbances
these
instruments
could
reduce
the
lunar
surface
to
within
less
than
yards
chapter
xi
fancy
and

have
you

asked
a
professor
ironically
of
one
of
his
pupils
no
sir
replied
the
pupil
still
more
ironically
but
i
must
say
i
have
heard
it
spoken
of
in
one
sense
the
pupil
witty
answer
might
be
given
by
a
large
majority
of
sublunary
beings
how
many
people
have
heard
speak
of
the
moon
who
have
never
seen
it
at
least
through
a
glass
or
a
telescope
how
many
have
never
examined
the
map
of
their
satellite
in
looking
at
a
selenographic
map
one
peculiarity
strikes
us
contrary
to
the
arrangement
followed
for
that
of
the
earth
and
mars
the
continents
occupy
more
particularly
the
southern
hemisphere
of
the
lunar
globe
these
continents
do
not
show
such
decided
clear
and
regular
boundary
lines
as
south
america
africa
and
the
indian
peninsula
their
angular
capricious
and
deeply
indented
coasts
are
rich
in
gulfs
and
peninsulas
they
remind
one
of
the
confusion
in
the
islands
of
the
sound
where
the
land
is
excessively
indented
if
navigation
ever
existed
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
it
must
have
been
wonderfully
difficult
and
dangerous
and
we
may
well
pity
the
selenite
sailors
and
hydrographers
the
former
when
they
came
upon
these
perilous
coasts
the
latter
when
they
took
the
soundings
of
its
stormy
banks
we
may
also
notice
that
on
the
lunar
sphere
the
south
pole
is
much
more
continental
than
the
north
pole
on
the
latter
there
is
but
one
slight
strip
of
land
separated
from
other
continents
by
vast
seas
toward
the
south
continents
clothe
almost
the
whole
of
the
hemisphere
it
is
even
possible
that
the
selenites
have
already
planted
the
flag
on
one
of
their
poles
while
franklin
ross
kane
dumont
and
lambert
have
never
yet
been
able
to
attain

unknown
point
of
the
terrestrial
globe
as
to
islands
they
are
numerous
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
nearly
all
oblong
or
circular
and
as
if
traced
with
the
compass
they
seem
to
form
one
vast
archipelago
equal
to
that
charming
group
lying
between
greece
and
asia
minor
and
which
mythology
in
ancient
times
adorned
with
most
graceful
legends
involuntarily
the
names
of
naxos
tenedos
and
carpathos
rise
before
the
mind
and
we
seek
vainly
for
ulysses
vessel
or
the
clipper
of
the
argonauts
so
at
least
it
was
in
michel
ardan
eyes
to
him
it
was
a
grecian
archipelago
that
he
saw
on
the
map
to
the
eyes
of
his
companions
the
aspect
of
these
coasts
recalled
rather
the
land
of
new
brunswick
and
nova
scotia
and
where
the
frenchman
discovered
traces
of
the
heroes
of
fable
these
americans
were
marking
the
most
favorable
points
for
the
establishment
of
stores
in
the
interests
of
lunar
commerce
and
industry
after
wandering
over
these
vast
continents
the
eye
is
attracted
by
the
still
greater
seas
not
only
their
formation
but
their
situation
and
aspect
remind
one
of
the
terrestrial
oceans
but
again
as
on
earth
these
seas
occupy
the
greater
portion
of
the
globe
but
in
point
of
fact
these
are
not
liquid
spaces
but
plains
the
nature
of
which
the
travelers
hoped
soon
to
determine
astronomers
we
must
allow
have
graced
these
pretended
seas
with
at
least
odd
names
which
science
has
respected
up
to
the
present
time
michel
ardan
was
right
when
he
compared
this
map
to
a
tendre
card
got
up
by
a
scudary
or
a
cyrano
de
bergerac
only
said
he
it
is
no
longer
the
sentimental
card
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
the
card
of
life
very
neatly
divided
into
two
parts
one
feminine
the
other
masculine
the
right
hemisphere
for
woman
the
left
for
man
in
speaking
thus
michel
made
his
prosaic
companions
shrug
their
shoulders
barbicane
and
nicholl
looked
upon
the
lunar
map
from
a
very
different
point
of
view
to
that
of
their
fantastic
friend
nevertheless
their
fantastic
friend
was
a
little
in
the
right
judge
for
yourselves
in
the
left
hemisphere
stretches
the
sea
of
clouds
where
human
reason
is
so
often
shipwrecked
not
far
off
lies
the
sea
of
rains
fed
by
all
the
fever
of
existence
near
this
is
the
sea
of
storms
where
man
is
ever
fighting
against
his
passions
which
too
often
gain
the
victory
then
worn
out
by
deceit
treasons
infidelity
and
the
whole
body
of
terrestrial
misery
what
does
he
find
at
the
end
of
his
career
that
vast
sea
of
humors
barely
softened
by
some
drops
of
the
waters
from
the
gulf
of
dew
clouds
rain
storms
and
humors
does
the
life
of
man
contain
aught
but
these
and
is
it
not
summed
up
in
these
four
words
the
right
hemisphere
dedicated
to
the
ladies
encloses
smaller
seas
whose
significant
names
contain
every
incident
of
a
feminine
existence
there
is
the
sea
of
serenity
over
which
the
young
girl
bends
the
lake
of
dreams
reflecting
a
joyous
future
the
sea
of
nectar
with
its
waves
of
tenderness
and
breezes
of
love
the
sea
of
fruitfulness
the
sea
of
crises
then
the
sea
of
vapors
whose
dimensions
are
perhaps
a
little
too
confined
and
lastly
that
vast
sea
of
tranquillity
in
which
every
false
passion
every
useless
dream
every
unsatisfied
desire
is
at
length
absorbed
and
whose
waves
emerge
peacefully
into
the
lake
of
death
what
a
strange
succession
of
names
what
a
singular
division
of
the
moon
two
hemispheres
joined
to
one
another
like
man
and
woman
and
forming
that
sphere
of
life
carried
into
space
and
was
not
the
fantastic
michel
right
in
thus
interpreting
the
fancies
of
the
ancient
astronomers
but
while
his
imagination
thus
roved
over
the
seas
his
grave
companions
were
considering
things
more
geographically
they
were
learning
this
new
world
by
heart
they
were
measuring
angles
and
diameters

orographic
details
the
course
taken
by
the
projectile
as
we
have
before
remarked
was
bearing
it
toward
the
moon
northern
hemisphere
the
travelers
were
far
from
the
central
point
which
they
would
have
struck
had
their
course
not
been
subject
to
an
irremediable
deviation
it
was
past
midnight
and
barbicane
then
estimated
the
distance
at
seven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
which
was
a
little
greater
than
the
length
of
the
lunar
radius
and
which
would
diminish
as
it
advanced
nearer
to
the
north
pole
the
projectile
was
then
not
at
the
altitude
of
the
equator
but
across
the
tenth
parallel
and
from
that
latitude
carefully
taken
on
the
map
to
the
pole
barbicane
and
his
two
companions
were
able
to
observe
the
moon
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
indeed
by
means
of
glasses
the
distance
was
reduced
to
little
more
than
fourteen
miles
the
telescope
of
the
rocky
mountains
brought
the
moon
much
nearer
but
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
singularly
lessened
its
power
thus
barbicane
posted
in
his
projectile
with
the
glasses
to
his
eyes
could
seize
upon
details
which
were
almost
imperceptible
to
earthly
observers
my
friends
said
the
president
in
a
serious
voice
i
do
not
know
whither
we
are
going
i
do
not
know
if
we
shall
ever
see
the
terrestrial
globe
again
nevertheless
let
us
proceed
as
if
our
work
would
one
day
by
useful
to
our
let
us
keep
our
minds
free
from
every
other
consideration
we
are
astronomers
and
this
projectile
is
a
room
in
the
cambridge
university
carried
into
space
let
us
make
our
observations
this
said
work
was
begun
with
great
exactness
and
they
faithfully
reproduced
the
different
aspects
of
the
moon
at
the
different
distances
which
the
projectile
reached
at
the
time
that
the
projectile
was
as
high
as
the
tenth
parallel
north
latitude
it
seemed
rigidly
to
follow
the
twentieth
degree
east
longitude
we
must
here
make
one
important
remark
with
regard
to
the
map
by
which
they
were
taking
observations
in
the
selenographical
maps
where
on
account
of
the
reversing
of
the
objects
by
the
glasses
the
south
is
above
and
the
north
below
it
would
seem
natural
that
on
account
of
that
inversion
the
east
should
be
to
the
left
hand
and
the
west
to
the
right
but
it
is
not
so
if
the
map
were
turned
upside
down
showing
the
moon
as
we
see
her
the
east
would
be
to
the
left
and
the
west
to
the
right
contrary
to
that
which
exists
on
terrestrial
maps
the
following
is
the
reason
of
this
anomaly
observers
in
the
northern
hemisphere
say
in
europe
see
the
moon
in
the
south
according
to
them
when
they
take
observations
they
turn
their
backs
to
the
north
the
reverse
position
to
that
which
they
occupy
when
they
study
a
terrestrial
map
as
they
turn
their
backs
to
the
north
the
east
is
on
their
left
and
the
west
to
their
right
to
observers
in
the
southern
hemisphere
patagonia
for
example
the
west
would
be
quite
to
their
left
and
the
east
to
their
right
as
the
south
is
behind
them
such
is
the
reason
of
the
apparent
reversing
of
these
two
cardinal
points
and
we
must
bear
it
in
mind
in
order
to
be
able
to
follow
president
barbicane
observations
with
the
help
of
boeer
and
moedler
the
travelers
were
able
at
once
to
recognize
that
portion
of
the
disc
enclosed
within
the
field
of
their
glasses
what
are
we
looking
at
at
this
moment
asked
michel
at
the
northern
part
of
the
of
clouds
answered
barbicane
we
are
too
far
off
to
recognize
its
nature
are
these
plains
composed
of
arid
sand
as
the
first
astronomer
maintained
or
are
they
nothing
but
immense
forests
according
to
warren
de
la
rue
opinion
who
gives
the
moon
an
atmosphere
though
a
very
low
and
a
very
dense
one
that
we
shall
know
by
and
by
we
must
affirm
nothing
until
we
are
in
a
position
to
do
so
this
sea
of
clouds
is
rather
doubtfully
marked
out
upon
the
maps
it
is
supposed
that
these
vast
plains
are
strewn
with
blocks
of
lava
from
the
neighboring
volcanoes
on
its
right
ptolemy
purbach
arzachel
but
the
projectile
was
advancing
and
sensibly
nearing
it
soon
there
appeared
the
heights
which
bound
this
sea
at
this
northern
limit
before
them
rose
a
mountain
radiant
with
beauty
the
top
of
which
seemed
lost
in
an
eruption
of
solar
rays
that
is
asked
michel
copernicus
replied
barbicane
let
us
see
copernicus
this
mount
situated
in
north
latitude
and
east
longitude
rose
to
a
height
of
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
moon
it
is
quite
visible
from
the
earth
and
astronomers
can
study
it
with
ease
particularly
during
the
phase
between
the
last
quarter
and
the
new
moon
because
then
the
shadows
are
thrown
lengthways
from
east
to
west
allowing
them
to
measure
the
heights
this
copernicus
forms
the
most
important
of
the
radiating
system
situated
in
the
southern
hemisphere
according
to
tycho
brahe
it
rises
isolated
like
a
gigantic
lighthouse
on
that
portion
of
the
sea
of
clouds
which
is
bounded
by
the
sea
of
tempests
thus
lighting
by
its
splendid
rays
two
oceans
at
a
time
it
was
a
sight
without
an
equal
those
long
luminous
trains
so
dazzling
in
the
full
moon
and
which
passing
the
boundary
chain
on
the
north
extends
to
the
sea
of
rains
at
one
of
the
terrestrial
morning
the
projectile
like
a
balloon
borne
into
space
overlooked
the
top
of
this
superb
mount
barbicane
could
recognize
perfectly
its
chief
features
copernicus
is
comprised
in
the
series
of
ringed
mountains
of
the
first
order
in
the
division
of
great
circles
like
kepler
and
aristarchus
which
overlook
the
ocean
of
tempests
sometimes
it
appeared
like
a
brilliant
point
through
the
cloudy
light
and
was
taken
for
a
volcano
in
activity
but
it
is
only
an
extinct
one
like
all
on
that
side
of
the
moon
its
circumference
showed
a
diameter
of
about
leagues
the
glasses
discovered
traces
of
stratification
produced
by
successive
eruptions
and
the
neighborhood
was
strewn
with
volcanic
remains
which
still
choked
some
of
the
craters
there
exist
said
barbicane
several
kinds
of
circles
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
copernicus
belongs
to
the
radiating
class
if
we
were
nearer
we
should
see
the
cones
bristling
on
the
inside
which
in
former
times
were
so
many
fiery
mouths
a
curious
arrangement
and
one
without
an
exception
on
the
lunar
disc
is
that
the
interior
surface
of
these
circles
is
the
reverse
of
the
exterior
and
contrary
to
the
form
taken
by
terrestrial
craters
it
follows
then
that
the
general
curve
of
the
bottom
of
these
circles
gives
a
sphere
of
a
smaller
diameter
than
that
of
the
moon
and
why
this
peculiar
disposition
asked
nicholl
we
do
not
know
replied
barbicane
what
splendid
radiation
said
michel
one
could
hardly
see
a
finer
spectacle
i
think
what
would
you
say
then
replied
barbicane
if
chance
should
bear
us
toward
the
southern
hemisphere
well
i
should
say
that
it
was
still
more
beautiful
retorted
michel
ardan
at
this
moment
the
projectile
hung
perpendicularly
over
the
circle
the
circumference
of
copernicus
formed
almost
a
perfect
circle
and
its
steep
escarpments
were
clearly
defined
they
could
even
distinguish
a
second
ringed
enclosure
around
spread
a
grayish
plain
of
a
wild
aspect
on
which
every
relief
was
marked
in
yellow
at
the
bottom
of
the
circle
as
if
enclosed
in
a
jewel
case
sparkled
for
one
instant
two
or
three
eruptive
cones
like
enormous
dazzling
gems
toward
the
north
the
escarpments
were
lowered
by
a
depression
which
would
probably
have
given
access
to
the
interior
of
the
crater
in
passing
over
the
surrounding
plains
barbicane
noticed
a
great
number
of
less
important
mountains
and
among
others
a
little
ringed
one
called
guy
lussac
the
breadth
of
which
measured
twelve
miles
toward
the
south
the
plain
was
very
flat
without
one
elevation
without
one
projection
toward
the
north
on
the
contrary
till
where
it
was
bounded
by
the
sea
of
storms
it
resembled
a
liquid
surface
agitated
by
a
storm
of
which
the
hills
and
hollows
formed
a
succession
of
waves
suddenly
congealed
over
the
whole
of
this
and
in
all
directions
lay
the
luminous
lines
all
converging
to
the
summit
of
copernicus
the
travelers
discussed
the
origin
of
these
strange
rays
but
they
could
not
determine
their
nature
any
more
than
terrestrial
observers
but
why
said
nicholl
should
not
these
rays
be
simply
spurs
of
mountains
which
reflect
more
vividly
the
light
of
the
sun
no
replied
barbicane
if
it
was
so
under
certain
conditions
of
the
moon
these
ridges
would
cast
shadows
and
they
do
not
cast
any
and
indeed
these
rays
only
appeared
when
the
orb
of
day
was
in
opposition
to
the
moon
and
disappeared
as
soon
as
its
rays
became
oblique
but
how
have
they
endeavored
to
explain
these
lines
of
light
asked
michel
for
i
can
not
believe
that
savants
would
ever
be
stranded
for
want
of
an
explanation
yes
replied
barbicane
herschel
has
put
forward
an
opinion
but
he
did
not
venture
to
affirm
it
never
mind
what
was
the
opinion
he
thought
that
these
rays
might
be
streams
of
cooled
lava
which
shone
when
the
sun
beat
straight
upon
them
it
may
be
so
but
nothing
can
be
less
certain
besides
if
we
pass
nearer
to
tycho
we
shall
be
in
a
better
position
to
find
out
the
cause
of
this
radiation
do
you
know
my
friends
what
that
plain
seen
from
the
height
we
are
at
resembles
said
michel
no
replied
nicholl
very
well
with
all
those
pieces
of
lava
lengthened
like
rockets
it
resembles
an
immense
game
of
spelikans
thrown
pellmell
there
wants
but
the
hook
to
pull
them
out
one
by
one
do
be
serious
said
barbicane
well
let
us
be
serious
replied
michel
quietly
and
instead
of
spelikans
let
us
put
bones
this
plain
would
then
be
nothing
but
an
immense
cemetery
on
which
would
repose
the
mortal
remains
of
thousands
of
extinct
generations
do
you
prefer
that
comparison
one
is
as
good
as
the
other
retorted
barbicane
my
word
you
are
difficult
to
please
answered
michel
my
worthy
friend
continued
the
barbicane
it
matters
but
little
what
it
when
we
do
not
know
what
it
well
answered
exclaimed
michel
that
will
teach
me
to
reason
with
savants
but
the
projectile
continued
to
advance
with
almost
uniform
speed
around
the
lunar
disc
the
travelers
we
may
easily
imagine
did
not
dream
of
taking
a
moment
rest
every
minute
changed
the
landscape
which
fled
from
beneath
their
gaze
about
half
past
one
in
the
morning
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
tops
of
another
mountain
barbicane
consulting
his
map
recognized
eratosthenes
it
was
a
ringed
mountain
nine
thousand
feet
high
and
one
of
those
circles
so
numerous
on
this
satellite
with
regard
to
this
barbicane
related
kepler
singular
opinion
on
the
formation
of
circles
according
to
that
celebrated
mathematician
these
cavities
had
been
dug
by
the
hand
of
man
for
what
purpose
asked
nicholl
for
a
very
natural
one
replied
barbicane
the
selenites
might
have
undertaken
these
immense
works
and
dug
these
enormous
holes
for
a
refuge
and
shield
from
the
solar
rays
which
beat
upon
them
during
fifteen
consecutive
days
the
selenites
are
not
fools
said
michel
a
singular
idea
replied
nicholl
but
it
is
probable
that
kepler
did
not
know
the
true
dimensions
of
these
circles
for
the
digging
of
them
would
have
been
the
work
of
giants
quite
impossible
for
the
selenites
why
if
weight
on
the
moon
surface
is
six
times
less
than
on
the
earth
said
michel
but
if
the
selenites
are
six
times
smaller
retorted
nicholl
and
if
there
are
selenites
added
barbicane
this
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
soon
eratosthenes
disappeared
under
the
horizon
without
the
projectile
being
sufficiently
near
to
allow
close
observation
this
mountain
separated
the
apennines
from
the
carpathians
in
the
lunar
orography
they
have
discerned
some
chains
of
mountains
which
are
chiefly
distributed
over
the
northern
hemisphere
some
however
occupy
certain
portions
of
the
southern
hemisphere
also
about
two
in
the
morning
barbicane
found
that
they
were
above
the
twentieth
lunar
parallel
the
distance
of
the
projectile
from
the
moon
was
not
more
than
six
hundred
miles
barbicane
now
perceiving
that
the
projectile
was
steadily
approaching
the
lunar
disc
did
not
despair
if
not
of
reaching
her
at
least
of
discovering
the
secrets
of
her
configuration
chapter
xiii
lunar
landscapes
at
two
in
the
morning
the
projectile
was
over
the
thirteenth
lunar
parallel
and
at
the
effective
distance
of
five
hundred
miles
reduced
by
the
glasses
to
five
it
still
seemed
impossible
however
that
it
could
ever
touch
any
part
of
the
disc
its
motive
speed
comparatively
so
moderate
was
inexplicable
to
president
barbicane
at
that
distance
from
the
moon
it
must
have
been
considerable
to
enable
it
to
bear
up
against
her
attraction
here
was
a
phenomenon
the
cause
of
which
escaped
them
again
besides
time
failed
them
to
investigate
the
cause
all
lunar
relief
was
defiling
under
the
eyes
of
the
travelers
and
they
would
not
lose
a
single
detail
under
the
glasses
the
disc
appeared
at
the
distance
of
five
miles
what
would
an
aeronaut
borne
to
this
distance
from
the
earth
distinguish
on
its
surface
we
can
not
say
since
the
greatest
ascension
has
not
been
more
than
feet
this
however
is
an
exact
description
of
what
barbicane
and
his
companions
saw
at
this
height
large
patches
of
different
colors
appeared
on
the
disc
selenographers
are
not
agreed
upon
the
nature
of
these
colors
there
are
several
and
rather
vividly
marked
julius
schmidt
pretends
that
if
the
terrestrial
oceans
were
dried
up
a
selenite
observer
could
not
distinguish
on
the
globe
a
greater
diversity
of
shades
between
the
oceans
and
the
continental
plains
than
those
on
the
moon
present
to
a
terrestrial
observer
according
to
him
the
color
common
to
the
vast
plains
known
by
the
name
of
seas
is
a
dark
gray
mixed
with
green
and
brown
some
of
the
large
craters
present
the
same
appearance
barbicane
knew
this
opinion
of
the
german
selenographer
an
opinion
shared
by
boeer
and
moedler
observation
has
proved
that
right
was
on
their
side
and
not
on
that
of
some
astronomers
who
admit
the
existence
of
only
gray
on
the
moon
surface
in
some
parts
green
was
very
distinct
such
as
springs
according
to
julius
schmidt
from
the
seas
of
serenity
and
humors
barbicane
also
noticed
large
craters
without
any
interior
cones
which
shed
a
bluish
tint
similar
to
the
reflection
of
a
sheet
of
steel
freshly
polished
these
colors
belonged
really
to
the
lunar
disc
and
did
not
result
as
some
astronomers
say
either
from
the
imperfection
in
the
objective
of
the
glasses
or
from
the
interposition
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
not
a
doubt
existed
in
barbicane
mind
with
regard
to
it
as
he
observed
it
through
space
and
so
could
not
commit
any
optical
error
he
considered
the
establishment
of
this
fact
as
an
acquisition
to
science
now
were
these
shades
of
green
belonging
to
tropical
vegetation
kept
up
by
a
low
dense
atmosphere
he
could
not
yet
say
farther
on
he
noticed
a
reddish
tint
quite
defined
the
same
shade
had
before
been
observed
at
the
bottom
of
an
isolated
enclosure
known
by
the
name
of
lichtenburg
circle
which
is
situated
near
the
hercynian
mountains
on
the
borders
of
the
moon
but
they
could
not
tell
the
nature
of
it
they
were
not
more
fortunate
with
regard
to
another
peculiarity
of
the
disc
for
they
could
not
decide
upon
the
cause
of
it
michel
ardan
was
watching
near
the
president
when
he
noticed
long
white
lines
vividly
lighted
up
by
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
it
was
a
succession
of
luminous
furrows
very
different
from
the
radiation
of
copernicus
not
long
before
they
ran
parallel
with
each
other
michel
with
his
usual
readiness
hastened
to
exclaim
look
there
cultivated
fields
cultivated
fields
replied
nicholl
shrugging
his
shoulders
plowed
at
all
events
retorted
michel
ardan
but
what
laborers
those
selenites
must
be
and
what
giant
oxen
they
must
harness
to
their
plow
to
cut
such
furrows
they
are
not
furrows
said
barbicane
they
are
rifts
stuff
replied
michel
mildly
but
what
do
you
mean
by
in
the
scientific
world
barbicane
immediately
enlightened
his
companion
as
to
what
he
knew
about
lunar
rifts
he
knew
that
they
were
a
kind
of
furrow
found
on
every
part
of
the
disc
which
was
not
mountainous
that
these
furrows
generally
isolated
measured
from
to
leagues
in
length
that
their
breadth
varied
from
to
yards
and
that
their
borders
were
strictly
parallel
but
he
knew
nothing
more
either
of
their
formation
or
their
nature
barbicane
through
his
glasses
observed
these
rifts
with
great
attention
he
noticed
that
their
borders
were
formed
of
steep
declivities
they
were
long
parallel
ramparts
and
with
some
small
amount
of
imagination
he
might
have
admitted
the
existence
of
long
lines
of
fortifications
raised
by
selenite
engineers
of
these
different
rifts
some
were
perfectly
straight
as
if
cut
by
a
line
others
were
slightly
curved
though
still
keeping
their
borders
parallel
some
crossed
each
other
some
cut
through
craters
here
they
wound
through
ordinary
cavities
such
as
posidonius
or
petavius
there
they
wound
through
the
seas
such
as
the
sea
of
serenity
these
natural
accidents
naturally
excited
the
imaginations
of
these
terrestrial
astronomers
the
first
observations
had
not
discovered
these
rifts
neither
hevelius
cassin
la
hire
nor
herschel
seemed
to
have
known
them
it
was
schroeter
who
in
first
drew
attention
to
them
others
followed
who
studied
them
as
pastorff
gruithuysen
boeer
and
moedler
at
this
time
their
number
amounts
to
seventy
but
if
they
have
been
counted
their
nature
has
not
yet
been
determined
they
are
certainly
fortifications
any
more
than
they
are
the
ancient
beds
of
rivers
for
on
one
side
the
waters
so
slight
on
the
moon
surface
could
never
have
worn
such
drains
for
themselves
and
on
the
other
they
often
cross
craters
of
great
elevation
we
must
however
allow
that
michel
ardan
had
an
idea
and
that
without
knowing
it
he
coincided
in
that
respect
with
julius
schmidt
why
said
he
should
not
these
unaccountable
appearances
be
simply
phenomena
of
vegetation
what
do
you
mean
asked
barbicane
quickly
do
not
excite
yourself
my
worthy
president
replied
michel
might
it
not
be
possible
that
the
dark
lines
forming
that
bastion
were
rows
of
trees
regularly
placed
you
stick
to
your
vegetation
then
said
barbicane
i
like
retorted
michel
ardan
to
explain
what
you
savants
can
not
explain
at
least
my
hypotheses
has
the
advantage
of
indicating
why
these
rifts
disappear
or
seem
to
disappear
at
certain
seasons
and
for
what
reason
for
the
reason
that
the
trees
become
invisible
when
they
lose
their
leaves
and
visible
again
when
they
regain
them
your
explanation
is
ingenious
my
dear
companion
replied
barbicane
but
inadmissible
why
because
so
to
speak
there
are
no
seasons
on
the
moon
surface
and
that
consequently
the
phenomena
of
vegetation
of
which
you
speak
can
not
occur
indeed
the
slight
obliquity
of
the
lunar
axis
keeps
the
sun
at
an
almost
equal
height
in
every
latitude
above
the
equatorial
regions
the
radiant
orb
almost
invariably
occupies
the
zenith
and
does
not
pass
the
limits
of
the
horizon
in
the
polar
regions
thus
according
to
each
region
there
reigns
a
perpetual
winter
spring
summer
or
autumn
as
in
the
planet
jupiter
whose
axis
is
but
little
inclined
upon
its
orbit
what
origin
do
they
attribute
to
these
rifts
that
is
a
question
difficult
to
solve
they
are
certainly
anterior
to
the
formation
of
craters
and
circles
for
several
have
introduced
themselves
by
breaking
through
their
circular
ramparts
thus
it
may
be
that
contemporary
with
the
later
geological
epochs
they
are
due
to
the
expansion
of
natural
forces
but
the
projectile
had
now
attained
the
fortieth
degree
of
lunar
latitude
at
a
distance
not
exceeding
miles
through
the
glasses
objects
appeared
to
be
only
four
miles
distant
at
this
point
under
their
feet
rose
mount
helicon
feet
high
and
round
about
the
left
rose
moderate
elevations
enclosing
a
small
portion
of
the
sea
of
rains
under
the
name
of
the
gulf
of
iris
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
would
have
to
be
one
hundred
and
seventy
times
more
transparent
than
it
is
to
allow
astronomers
to
make
perfect
observations
on
the
surface
but
in
the
void
in
which
the
projectile
floated
no
fluid
interposed
itself
between
the
eye
of
the
observer
and
the
object
observed
and
more
barbicane
found
himself
carried
to
a
greater
distance
than
the
most
powerful
telescopes
had
ever
done
before
either
that
of
lord
rosse
or
that
of
the
rocky
mountains
he
was
therefore
under
extremely
favorable
conditions
for
solving
that
great
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
but
the
solution
still
escaped
him
he
could
distinguish
nothing
but
desert
beds
immense
plains
and
toward
the
north
arid
mountains
not
a
work
betrayed
the
hand
of
man
not
a
ruin
marked
his
course
not
a
group
of
animals
was
to
be
seen
indicating
life
even
in
an
inferior
degree
in
no
part
was
there
life
in
no
part
was
there
an
appearance
of
vegetation
of
the
three
kingdoms
which
share
the
terrestrial
globe
between
them
one
alone
was
represented
on
the
lunar
and
that
the
mineral
ah
indeed
said
michel
ardan
a
little
out
of
countenance
then
you
see
no
one
no
answered
nicholl
up
to
this
time
not
a
man
not
an
animal
not
a
tree
after
all
whether
the
atmosphere
has
taken
refuge
at
the
bottom
of
cavities
in
the
midst
of
the
circles
or
even
on
the
opposite
face
of
the
moon
we
can
not
decide
besides
added
barbicane
even
to
the
most
piercing
eye
a
man
can
not
be
distinguished
farther
than
three
and
a
half
miles
off
so
that
if
there
are
any
selenites
they
can
see
our
projectile
but
we
can
not
see
them
toward
four
in
the
morning
at
the
height
of
the
fiftieth
parallel
the
distance
was
reduced
to
miles
to
the
left
ran
a
line
of
mountains
capriciously
shaped
lying
in
the
full
light
to
the
right
on
the
contrary
lay
a
black
hollow
resembling
a
vast
well
unfathomable
and
gloomy
drilled
into
the
lunar
soil
this
hole
was
the
black
lake
it
was
pluto
a
deep
circle
which
can
be
conveniently
studied
from
the
earth
between
the
last
quarter
and
the
new
moon
when
the
shadows
fall
from
west
to
east
this
black
color
is
rarely
met
with
on
the
surface
of
the
satellite
as
yet
it
has
only
been
recognized
in
the
depths
of
the
circle
of
endymion
to
the
east
of
the
cold
sea
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
at
the
bottom
of
grimaldi
circle
on
the
equator
toward
the
eastern
border
of
the
orb
pluto
is
an
annular
mountain
situated
in
north
latitude
and
east
longitude
its
circuit
is
miles
long
and
broad
barbicane
regretted
that
they
were
not
passing
directly
above
this
vast
opening
there
was
an
abyss
to
fathom
perhaps
some
mysterious
phenomenon
to
surprise
but
the
projectile
course
could
not
be
altered
they
must
rigidly
submit
they
could
not
guide
a
balloon
still
less
a
projectile
when
once
enclosed
within
its
walls
toward
five
in
the
morning
the
northern
limits
of
the
sea
of
rains
was
at
length
passed
the
mounts
of
condamine
and
fontenelle
remained
one
on
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
that
part
of
the
disc
beginning
with
was
becoming
quite
mountainous
the
glasses
brought
them
to
within
two
miles
less
than
that
separating
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
from
the
level
of
the
sea
the
whole
region
was
bristling
with
spikes
and
circles
toward
the
philolaus
stood
predominant
at
a
height
of
feet
with
its
elliptical
crater
and
seen
from
this
distance
the
disc
showed
a
very
fantastical
appearance
landscapes
were
presented
to
the
eye
under
very
different
conditions
from
those
on
the
earth
and
also
very
inferior
to
them
the
moon
having
no
atmosphere
the
consequences
arising
from
the
absence
of
this
gaseous
envelope
have
already
been
shown
no
twilight
on
her
surface
night
following
day
and
day
following
night
with
the
suddenness
of
a
lamp
which
is
extinguished
or
lighted
amid
profound
darkness
no
transition
from
cold
to
heat
the
temperature
falling
in
an
instant
from
boiling
point
to
the
cold
of
space
another
consequence
of
this
want
of
air
is
that
absolute
darkness
reigns
where
the
sun
rays
do
not
penetrate
that
which
on
earth
is
called
diffusion
of
light
that
luminous
matter
which
the
air
holds
in
suspension
which
creates
the
twilight
and
the
daybreak
which
produces
the
and
and
all
the
magic
of
does
not
exist
on
the
moon
hence
the
harshness
of
contrasts
which
only
admit
of
two
colors
black
and
white
if
a
selenite
were
to
shade
his
eyes
from
the
sun
rays
the
sky
would
seem
absolutely
black
and
the
stars
would
shine
to
him
as
on
the
darkest
night
judge
of
the
impression
produced
on
barbicane
and
his
three
friends
by
this
strange
scene
their
eyes
were
confused
they
could
no
longer
grasp
the
respective
distances
of
the
different
plains
a
lunar
landscape
without
the
softening
of
the
phenomena
of
could
not
be
rendered
by
an
earthly
landscape
painter
it
would
be
spots
of
ink
on
a
white
page
nothing
more
this
aspect
was
not
altered
even
when
the
projectile
at
the
height
of
was
only
separated
from
the
moon
by
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
nor
even
when
at
five
in
the
morning
it
passed
at
less
than
miles
from
the
mountain
of
gioja
a
distance
reduced
by
the
glasses
to
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
seemed
as
if
the
moon
might
be
touched
by
the
hand
it
seemed
impossible
that
before
long
the
projectile
would
not
strike
her
if
only
at
the
north
pole
the
brilliant
arch
of
which
was
so
distinctly
visible
on
the
black
sky
michel
ardan
wanted
to
open
one
of
the
scuttles
and
throw
himself
on
to
the
moon
surface
a
very
useless
attempt
for
if
the
projectile
could
not
attain
any
point
whatever
of
the
satellite
michel
carried
along
by
its
motion
could
not
attain
it
either
at
that
moment
at
six
the
lunar
pole
appeared
the
disc
only
presented
to
the
travelers
gaze
one
half
brilliantly
lit
up
while
the
other
disappeared
in
the
darkness
suddenly
the
projectile
passed
the
line
of
demarcation
between
intense
light
and
absolute
darkness
and
was
plunged
in
profound
night
chapter
xiv
the
night
of
three
hundred
and
hours
and
a
half
at
the
moment
when
this
phenomenon
took
place
so
rapidly
the
projectile
was
skirting
the
moon
north
pole
at
less
than
miles
distance
some
seconds
had
sufficed
to
plunge
it
into
the
absolute
darkness
of
space
the
transition
was
so
sudden
without
shade
without
gradation
of
light
without
attenuation
of
the
luminous
waves
that
the
orb
seemed
to
have
been
extinguished
by
a
powerful
blow
melted
disappeared
michel
ardan
exclaimed
aghast
indeed
there
was
neither
reflection
nor
shadow
nothing
more
was
to
be
seen
of
that
disc
formerly
so
dazzling
the
darkness
was
complete
and
rendered
even
more
so
by
the
rays
from
the
stars
it
was
that
blackness
in
which
the
lunar
nights
are
insteeped
which
last
three
hundred
and
hours
and
a
half
at
each
point
of
the
disc
a
long
night
resulting
from
the
equality
of
the
translatory
and
rotary
movements
of
the
moon
the
projectile
immerged
in
the
conical
shadow
of
the
satellite
experienced
the
action
of
the
solar
rays
no
more
than
any
of
its
invisible
points
in
the
interior
the
obscurity
was
complete
they
could
not
see
each
other
hence
the
necessity
of
dispelling
the
darkness
however
desirous
barbicane
might
be
to
husband
the
gas
the
reserve
of
which
was
small
he
was
obliged
to
ask
from
it
a
fictitious
light
an
expensive
brilliancy
which
the
sun
then
refused
devil
take
the
radiant
orb
exclaimed
michel
ardan
which
forces
us
to
expend
gas
instead
of
giving
us
his
rays
gratuitously
do
not
let
us
accuse
the
sun
said
nicholl
it
is
not
his
fault
but
that
of
the
moon
which
has
come
and
placed
herself
like
a
screen
between
us
and
it
it
is
the
sun
continued
michel
it
is
the
moon
retorted
nicholl
an
idle
dispute
which
barbicane
put
an
end
to
by
saying
my
friends
it
is
neither
the
fault
of
the
sun
nor
of
the
moon
it
is
the
fault
of
the
which
instead
of
rigidly
following
its
course
has
awkwardly
missed
it
to
be
more
just
it
is
the
fault
of
that
unfortunate
meteor
which
has
so
deplorably
altered
our
first
direction
well
replied
michel
ardan
as
the
matter
is
settled
let
us
have
breakfast
after
a
whole
night
of
watching
it
is
fair
to
build
ourselves
up
a
little
this
proposal
meeting
with
no
contradiction
michel
prepared
the
repast
in
a
few
minutes
but
they
ate
for
eating
sake
they
drank
without
toasts
without
hurrahs
the
bold
travelers
being
borne
away
into
gloomy
space
without
their
accustomed
of
rays
felt
a
vague
uneasiness
in
their
hearts
the
strange
shadow
so
dear
to
victor
hugo
pen
bound
them
on
all
sides
but
they
talked
over
the
interminable
night
of
three
hundred
and
hours
and
a
half
nearly
fifteen
days
which
the
law
of
physics
has
imposed
on
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
barbicane
gave
his
friends
some
explanation
of
the
causes
and
the
consequences
of
this
curious
phenomenon
curious
indeed
said
they
for
if
each
hemisphere
of
the
moon
is
deprived
of
solar
light
for
fifteen
days
that
above
which
we
now
float
does
not
even
enjoy
during
its
long
night
any
view
of
the
earth
so
beautifully
lit
up
in
a
word
she
has
no
moon
applying
this
designation
to
our
globe
but
on
one
side
of
her
disc
now
if
this
were
the
case
with
the
earth
if
for
example
europe
never
saw
the
moon
and
she
was
only
visible
at
the
antipodes
imagine
to
yourself
the
astonishment
of
a
european
on
arriving
in
australia
they
would
make
the
voyage
for
nothing
but
to
see
the
moon
replied
michel
very
well
continued
barbicane
that
astonishment
is
reserved
for
the
selenites
who
inhabit
the
face
of
the
moon
opposite
to
the
earth
a
face
which
is
ever
invisible
to
our
countrymen
of
the
terrestrial
globe
and
which
we
should
have
seen
added
nicholl
if
we
had
arrived
here
when
the
moon
was
new
that
is
to
say
fifteen
days
later
i
will
add
to
make
amends
continued
barbicane
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
visible
face
are
singularly
favored
by
nature
to
the
detriment
of
their
brethren
on
the
invisible
face
the
latter
as
you
see
have
dark
nights
of
hours
without
one
single
ray
to
break
the
darkness
the
other
on
the
contrary
when
the
sun
which
has
given
its
light
for
fifteen
days
sinks
below
the
horizon
see
a
splendid
orb
rise
on
the
opposite
horizon
it
is
the
earth
which
is
thirteen
times
greater
than
the
diminutive
moon
that
we
know
the
earth
which
developes
itself
at
a
diameter
of
two
degrees
and
which
sheds
a
light
thirteen
times
greater
than
that
qualified
by
atmospheric
strata
the
earth
which
only
disappears
at
the
moment
when
the
sun
reappears
in
its
turn
nicely
worded
said
michel
slightly
academical
perhaps
it
follows
then
continued
barbicane
without
knitting
his
brows
that
the
visible
face
of
the
disc
must
be
very
agreeable
to
inhabit
since
it
always
looks
on
either
the
sun
when
the
moon
is
full
or
on
the
earth
when
the
moon
is
new
but
said
nicholl
that
advantage
must
be
well
compensated
by
the
insupportable
heat
which
the
light
brings
with
it
the
inconvenience
in
that
respect
is
the
same
for
the
two
faces
for
the
earth
light
is
evidently
deprived
of
heat
but
the
invisible
face
is
still
more
searched
by
the
heat
than
the
visible
face
i
say
that
for
nicholl
because
michel
will
probably
not
understand
thank
you
said
michel
indeed
continued
barbicane
when
the
invisible
face
receives
at
the
same
time
light
and
heat
from
the
sun
it
is
because
the
moon
is
new
that
is
to
say
she
is
situated
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
it
follows
then
considering
the
position
which
she
occupies
in
opposition
when
full
that
she
is
nearer
to
the
sun
by
twice
her
distance
from
the
earth
and
that
distance
may
be
estimated
at
the
part
of
that
which
separates
the
sun
from
the
earth
or
in
round
numbers
miles
so
that
invisible
face
is
so
much
nearer
to
the
sun
when
she
receives
its
rays
quite
right
replied
nicholl
on
the
contrary
continued
barbicane
one
moment
said
michel
interrupting
his
grave
companion
what
do
you
want
i
ask
to
be
allowed
to
continue
the
explanation
and
why
to
prove
that
i
understand
get
along
with
you
said
barbicane
smiling
on
the
contrary
said
michel
imitating
the
tone
and
gestures
of
the
president
on
the
contrary
when
the
visible
face
of
the
moon
is
lit
by
the
sun
it
is
because
the
moon
is
full
that
is
to
say
opposite
the
sun
with
regard
to
the
earth
the
distance
separating
it
from
the
radiant
orb
is
then
increased
in
round
numbers
to
miles
and
the
heat
which
she
receives
must
be
a
little
less
very
well
said
exclaimed
barbicane
do
you
know
michel
that
for
an
amateur
you
are
intelligent
yes
replied
michel
coolly
we
are
all
so
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
barbicane
gravely
grasped
the
hand
of
his
amiable
companion
and
continued
to
enumerate
the
advantages
reserved
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
visible
face
among
others
he
mentioned
eclipses
of
the
sun
which
only
take
place
on
this
side
of
the
lunar
disc
since
in
order
that
they
may
take
place
it
is
necessary
for
the
moon
to
be
these
eclipses
caused
by
the
interposition
of
the
earth
between
the
moon
and
the
sun
can
last
during
which
time
by
reason
of
the
rays
refracted
by
its
atmosphere
the
terrestrial
globe
can
appear
as
nothing
but
a
black
point
upon
the
sun
so
said
nicholl
there
is
a
hemisphere
that
invisible
hemisphere
which
is
very
ill
supplied
very
ill
treated
by
nature
never
mind
replied
michel
if
we
ever
become
selenites
we
will
inhabit
the
visible
face
i
like
the
light
unless
by
any
chance
answered
nicholl
the
atmosphere
should
be
condensed
on
the
other
side
as
certain
astronomers
pretend
that
would
be
a
consideration
said
michel
breakfast
over
the
observers
returned
to
their
post
they
tried
to
see
through
the
darkened
scuttles
by
extinguishing
all
light
in
the
projectile
but
not
a
luminous
spark
made
its
way
through
the
darkness
one
inexplicable
fact
preoccupied
barbicane
why
having
passed
within
such
a
short
distance
of
the
moon
about
miles
only
why
the
projectile
had
not
fallen
if
its
speed
had
been
enormous
he
could
have
understood
that
the
fall
would
not
have
taken
place
but
with
a
relatively
moderate
speed
that
resistance
to
the
moon
attraction
could
not
be
explained
was
the
projectile
under
some
foreign
influence
did
some
kind
of
body
retain
it
in
the
ether
it
was
quite
evident
that
it
could
never
reach
any
point
of
the
moon
whither
was
it
going
was
it
going
farther
from
or
nearing
the
disc
was
it
being
borne
in
that
profound
darkness
through
the
infinity
of
space
how
could
they
learn
how
calculate
in
the
midst
of
this
night
all
these
questions
made
barbicane
uneasy
but
he
could
not
solve
them
certainly
the
invisible
orb
was
perhaps
only
some
few
miles
off
but
neither
he
nor
his
companions
could
see
it
if
there
was
any
noise
on
its
surface
they
could
not
hear
it
air
that
medium
of
sound
was
wanting
to
transmit
the
groanings
of
that
moon
which
the
arabic
legends
call
a
man
already
half
granite
and
still
breathing
one
must
allow
that
that
was
enough
to
aggravate
the
most
patient
observers
it
was
just
that
unknown
hemisphere
which
was
stealing
from
their
sight
that
face
which
fifteen
days
sooner
or
fifteen
days
later
had
been
or
would
be
splendidly
illuminated
by
the
solar
rays
was
then
being
lost
in
utter
darkness
in
fifteen
days
where
would
the
projectile
be
who
could
say
where
would
the
chances
of
conflicting
attractions
have
drawn
it
to
the
disappointment
of
the
travelers
in
the
midst
of
this
utter
darkness
may
be
imagined
all
observation
of
the
lunar
disc
was
impossible
the
constellations
alone
claimed
all
their
attention
and
we
must
allow
that
the
astronomers
faye
charconac
and
secchi
never
found
themselves
in
circumstances
so
favorable
for
their
observation
indeed
nothing
could
equal
the
splendor
of
this
starry
world
bathed
in
limpid
ether
its
diamonds
set
in
the
heavenly
vault
sparkled
magnificently
the
eye
took
in
the
firmament
from
the
southern
cross
to
the
north
star
those
two
constellations
which
in
years
by
reason
of
the
succession
of
equinoxes
will
resign
their
part
of
the
polar
stars
the
one
to
canopus
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
other
to
wega
in
the
northern
imagination
loses
itself
in
this
sublime
infinity
amid
which
the
projectile
was
gravitating
like
a
new
star
created
by
the
hand
of
man
from
a
natural
cause
these
constellations
shone
with
a
soft
luster
they
did
not
twinkle
for
there
was
no
atmosphere
which
by
the
intervention
of
its
layers
unequally
dense
and
of
different
degrees
of
humidity
produces
this
scintillation
these
stars
were
soft
eyes
looking
out
into
the
dark
night
amid
the
silence
of
absolute
space
long
did
the
travelers
stand
mute
watching
the
constellated
firmament
upon
which
the
moon
like
a
vast
screen
made
an
enormous
black
hole
but
at
length
a
painful
sensation
drew
them
from
their
watchings
this
was
an
intense
cold
which
soon
covered
the
inside
of
the
glass
of
the
scuttles
with
a
thick
coating
of
ice
the
sun
was
no
longer
warming
the
projectile
with
its
direct
rays
and
thus
it
was
losing
the
heat
stored
up
in
its
walls
by
degrees
this
heat
was
rapidly
evaporating
into
space
by
radiation
and
a
considerably
lower
temperature
was
the
result
the
humidity
of
the
interior
was
changed
into
ice
upon
contact
with
the
glass
preventing
all
observation
nicholl
consulted
the
thermometer
and
saw
that
it
had
fallen
to
seventeen
degrees
centigrade
below
zero
so
that
in
spite
of
the
many
reasons
for
economizing
barbicane
after
having
begged
light
from
the
gas
was
also
obliged
to
beg
for
heat
the
projectile
low
temperature
was
no
longer
endurable
its
tenants
would
have
been
frozen
to
death
fahrenheit
well
observed
michel
we
can
not
reasonably
complain
of
the
monotony
of
our
journey
what
variety
we
have
had
at
least
in
temperature
now
we
are
blinded
with
light
and
saturated
with
heat
like
the
indians
of
the
pampas
now
plunged
into
profound
darkness
amid
the
cold
like
the
esquimaux
of
the
north
pole
no
indeed
we
have
no
right
to
complain
nature
does
wonders
in
our
honor
but
asked
nicholl
what
is
the
temperature
outside
exactly
that
of
the
planetary
space
replied
barbicane
then
continued
michel
ardan
would
not
this
be
the
time
to
make
the
experiment
which
we
dared
not
attempt
when
we
were
drowned
in
the
sun
rays
it
is
now
or
never
replied
barbicane
for
we
are
in
a
good
position
to
verify
the
temperature
of
space
and
see
if
fourier
or
pouillet
calculations
are
exact
in
any
case
it
is
cold
said
michel
see
the
steam
of
the
interior
is
condensing
on
the
glasses
of
the
scuttles
if
the
fall
continues
the
vapor
of
our
breath
will
fall
in
snow
around
us
let
us
prepare
a
thermometer
said
barbicane
we
may
imagine
that
an
ordinary
thermometer
would
afford
no
result
under
the
circumstances
in
which
this
instrument
was
to
be
exposed
the
mercury
would
have
been
frozen
in
its
ball
as
below
fahrenheit
below
zero
it
is
no
longer
liquid
but
barbicane
had
furnished
himself
with
a
spirit
thermometer
on
wafferdin
system
which
gives
the
minima
of
excessively
low
temperatures
before
beginning
the
experiment
this
instrument
was
compared
with
an
ordinary
one
and
then
barbicane
prepared
to
use
it
how
shall
we
set
about
it
asked
nicholl
nothing
is
easier
replied
michel
ardan
who
was
never
at
a
loss
we
open
the
scuttle
rapidly
throw
out
the
instrument
it
follows
the
projectile
with
exemplary
docility
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
draw
it
in
with
the
hand
asked
barbicane
with
the
hand
replied
michel
well
then
my
friend
do
not
expose
yourself
answered
barbicane
for
the
hand
that
you
draw
in
again
will
be
nothing
but
a
stump
frozen
and
deformed
by
the
frightful
cold
really
you
will
feel
as
if
you
had
had
a
terrible
burn
like
that
of
iron
at
a
white
heat
for
whether
the
heat
leaves
our
bodies
briskly
or
enters
briskly
it
is
exactly
the
same
thing
besides
i
am
not
at
all
certain
that
the
objects
we
have
thrown
out
are
still
following
us
why
not
asked
nicholl
because
if
we
are
passing
through
an
atmosphere
of
the
slightest
density
these
objects
will
be
retarded
again
the
darkness
prevents
our
seeing
if
they
still
float
around
us
but
in
order
not
to
expose
ourselves
to
the
loss
of
our
thermometer
we
will
fasten
it
and
we
can
then
more
easily
pull
it
back
again
barbicane
advice
was
followed
through
the
scuttle
rapidly
opened
nicholl
threw
out
the
instrument
which
was
held
by
a
short
cord
so
that
it
might
be
more
easily
drawn
up
the
scuttle
had
not
been
opened
more
than
a
second
but
that
second
had
sufficed
to
let
in
a
most
intense
cold
the
devil
exclaimed
michel
ardan
it
is
cold
enough
to
freeze
a
white
bear
barbicane
waited
until
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
which
was
more
than
time
enough
to
allow
the
instrument
to
fall
to
the
level
of
the
surrounding
temperature
then
it
was
rapidly
pulled
in
barbicane
calculated
the
quantity
of
spirits
of
wine
overflowed
into
the
little
vial
soldered
to
the
lower
part
of
the
instrument
and
said
a
hundred
and
forty
degrees
centigrade
below
zero
degrees
fahrenheit
below
zero
pouillet
was
right
and
fourier
wrong
that
was
the
undoubted
temperature
of
the
starry
space
such
is
perhaps
that
of
the
lunar
continents
when
the
orb
of
night
has
lost
by
radiation
all
the
heat
which
fifteen
days
of
sun
have
poured
into
her
chapter
xv
hyperbola
or
parabola
we
may
perhaps
be
astonished
to
find
barbicane
and
his
companions
so
little
occupied
with
the
future
reserved
for
them
in
their
metal
prison
which
was
bearing
them
through
the
infinity
of
space
instead
of
asking
where
they
were
going
they
passed
their
time
making
experiments
as
if
they
had
been
quietly
installed
in
their
own
study
we
might
answer
that
men
so
were
above
such
anxieties
that
they
did
not
trouble
themselves
about
such
trifles
and
that
they
had
something
else
to
do
than
to
occupy
their
minds
with
the
future
the
truth
was
that
they
were
not
masters
of
their
projectile
they
could
neither
check
its
course
nor
alter
its
direction
a
sailor
can
change
the
head
of
his
ship
as
he
pleases
an
aeronaut
can
give
a
vertical
motion
to
his
balloon
they
on
the
contrary
had
no
power
over
their
vehicle
every
maneuver
was
forbidden
hence
the
inclination
to
let
things
alone
or
as
the
sailors
say
let
her
run
where
did
they
find
themselves
at
this
moment
at
eight
in
the
morning
of
the
day
called
upon
the
earth
the
of
december
very
certainly
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
moon
and
even
near
enough
for
her
to
look
to
them
like
an
enormous
black
screen
upon
the
firmament
as
to
the
distance
which
separated
them
it
was
impossible
to
estimate
it
the
projectile
held
by
some
unaccountable
force
had
been
within
four
miles
of
grazing
the
satellite
north
pole
but
since
entering
the
cone
of
shadow
these
last
two
hours
had
the
distance
increased
or
diminished
every
point
of
mark
was
wanting
by
which
to
estimate
both
the
direction
and
the
speed
of
the
projectile
perhaps
it
was
rapidly
leaving
the
disc
so
that
it
would
soon
quit
the
pure
shadow
perhaps
again
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
nearing
it
so
much
that
in
a
short
time
it
might
strike
some
high
point
on
the
invisible
hemisphere
which
would
doubtlessly
have
ended
the
journey
much
to
the
detriment
of
the
travelers
a
discussion
arose
on
this
subject
and
michel
ardan
always
ready
with
an
explanation
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
projectile
held
by
the
lunar
attraction
would
end
by
falling
on
the
surface
of
the
terrestrial
globe
like
an
aerolite
first
of
all
my
friend
answered
barbicane
every
aerolite
does
not
fall
to
the
earth
it
is
only
a
small
proportion
which
do
so
and
if
we
had
passed
into
an
aerolite
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
should
ever
reach
the
surface
of
the
moon
but
how
if
we
get
near
enough
replied
michel
pure
mistake
replied
barbicane
have
you
not
seen
shooting
stars
rush
through
the
sky
by
thousands
at
certain
seasons
yes
well
these
stars
or
rather
corpuscles
only
shine
when
they
are
heated
by
gliding
over
the
atmospheric
layers
now
if
they
enter
the
atmosphere
they
pass
at
least
within
forty
miles
of
the
earth
but
they
seldom
fall
upon
it
the
same
with
our
projectile
it
may
approach
very
near
to
the
moon
and
not
yet
fall
upon
it
but
then
asked
michel
i
shall
be
curious
to
know
how
our
erring
vehicle
will
act
in
space
i
see
but
two
hypotheses
replied
barbicane
after
some
moments
reflection
what
are
they
the
projectile
has
the
choice
between
two
mathematical
curves
and
it
will
follow
one
or
the
other
according
to
the
speed
with
which
it
is
animated
and
which
at
this
moment
i
can
not
estimate
yes
said
nicholl
it
will
follow
either
a
parabola
or
a
hyperbola
just
so
replied
barbicane
with
a
certain
speed
it
will
assume
the
parabola
and
with
a
greater
the
hyperbola
i
like
those
grand
words
exclaimed
michel
ardan
one
knows
directly
what
they
mean
and
pray
what
is
your
parabola
if
you
please
my
friend
answered
the
captain
the
parabola
is
a
curve
of
the
second
order
the
result
of
the
section
of
a
cone
intersected
by
a
plane
parallel
to
one
of
the
sides
ah
ah
said
michel
in
a
satisfied
tone
it
is
very
nearly
continued
nicholl
the
course
described
by
a
bomb
launched
from
a
mortar
perfect
and
the
hyperbola
the
hyperbola
michel
is
a
curve
of
the
second
order
produced
by
the
intersection
of
a
conic
surface
and
a
plane
parallel
to
its
axis
and
constitutes
two
branches
separated
one
from
the
other
both
tending
indefinitely
in
the
two
directions
is
it
possible
exclaimed
michel
ardan
in
a
serious
tone
as
if
they
had
told
him
of
some
serious
event
what
i
particularly
like
in
your
definition
of
the
hyperbola
i
was
going
to
say
hyperblague
is
that
it
is
still
more
obscure
than
the
word
you
pretend
to
define
nicholl
and
barbicane
cared
little
for
michel
ardan
fun
they
were
deep
in
a
scientific
discussion
what
curve
would
the
projectile
follow
was
their
hobby
one
maintained
the
hyperbola
the
other
the
parabola
they
gave
each
other
reasons
bristling
with
their
arguments
were
couched
in
language
which
made
michel
jump
the
discussion
was
hot
and
neither
would
give
up
his
chosen
curve
to
his
adversary
this
scientific
dispute
lasted
so
long
that
it
made
michel
very
impatient
now
gentlemen
cosines
will
you
cease
to
throw
parabolas
and
hyperbolas
at
each
other
heads
i
want
to
understand
the
only
interesting
question
in
the
whole
affair
we
shall
follow
one
or
the
other
of
these
curves
good
but
where
will
they
lead
us
to
nowhere
replied
nicholl
how
nowhere
evidently
said
barbicane
they
are
open
curves
which
may
be
prolonged
indefinitely
ah
savants
cried
michel
and
what
are
either
the
one
or
the
other
to
us
from
the
moment
we
know
that
they
equally
lead
us
into
infinite
space
barbicane
and
nicholl
could
not
forbear
smiling
they
had
just
been
creating
art
for
art
sake
never
had
so
idle
a
question
been
raised
at
such
an
inopportune
moment
the
sinister
truth
remained
that
whether
hyperbolically
or
parabolically
borne
away
the
projectile
would
never
again
meet
either
the
earth
or
the
moon
what
would
become
of
these
bold
travelers
in
the
immediate
future
if
they
did
not
die
of
hunger
if
they
did
not
die
of
thirst
in
some
days
when
the
gas
failed
they
would
die
from
want
of
air
unless
the
cold
had
killed
them
first
still
important
as
it
was
to
economize
the
gas
the
excessive
lowness
of
the
surrounding
temperature
obliged
them
to
consume
a
certain
quantity
strictly
speaking
they
could
do
without
its
but
not
without
its
fortunately
the
caloric
generated
by
and
regnaut
apparatus
raised
the
temperature
of
the
interior
of
the
projectile
a
little
and
without
much
expenditure
they
were
able
to
keep
it
bearable
but
observations
had
now
become
very
difficult
the
dampness
of
the
projectile
was
condensed
on
the
windows
and
congealed
immediately
this
cloudiness
had
to
be
dispersed
continually
in
any
case
they
might
hope
to
be
able
to
discover
some
phenomena
of
the
highest
interest
but
up
to
this
time
the
disc
remained
dumb
and
dark
it
did
not
answer
the
multiplicity
of
questions
put
by
these
ardent
minds
a
matter
which
drew
this
reflection
from
michel
apparently
a
just
one
if
ever
we
begin
this
journey
over
again
we
shall
do
well
to
choose
the
time
when
the
moon
is
at
the
full
certainly
said
nicholl
that
circumstance
will
be
more
favorable
i
allow
that
the
moon
immersed
in
the
sun
rays
will
not
be
visible
during
the
transit
but
instead
we
should
see
the
earth
which
would
be
full
and
what
is
more
if
we
were
drawn
round
the
moon
as
at
this
moment
we
should
at
least
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
the
invisible
part
of
her
disc
magnificently
lit
well
said
nicholl
replied
michel
ardan
what
do
you
think
barbicane
i
think
this
answered
the
grave
president
if
ever
we
begin
this
journey
again
we
shall
start
at
the
same
time
and
under
the
same
conditions
suppose
we
had
attained
our
end
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
found
continents
in
broad
daylight
than
a
country
plunged
in
utter
darkness
would
not
our
first
installation
have
been
made
under
better
circumstances
yes
evidently
as
to
the
invisible
side
we
could
have
visited
it
in
our
exploring
expeditions
on
the
lunar
globe
so
that
the
time
of
the
full
moon
was
well
chosen
but
we
ought
to
have
arrived
at
the
end
and
in
order
to
have
so
arrived
we
ought
to
have
suffered
no
deviation
on
the
road
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
answered
michel
ardan
here
is
however
a
good
opportunity
lost
of
observing
the
other
side
of
the
moon
but
the
projectile
was
now
describing
in
the
shadow
that
incalculable
course
which
no
would
allow
them
to
ascertain
had
its
direction
been
altered
either
by
the
influence
of
the
lunar
attraction
or
by
the
action
of
some
unknown
star
barbicane
could
not
say
but
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
relative
position
of
the
vehicle
and
barbicane
verified
it
about
four
in
the
morning
the
change
consisted
in
this
that
the
base
of
the
projectile
had
turned
toward
the
moon
surface
and
was
so
held
by
a
perpendicular
passing
through
its
axis
the
attraction
that
is
to
say
the
weight
had
brought
about
this
alteration
the
heaviest
part
of
the
projectile
inclined
toward
the
invisible
disc
as
if
it
would
fall
upon
it
was
it
falling
were
the
travelers
attaining
that
much
desired
end
no
and
the
observation
of
a
quite
inexplicable
in
itself
showed
barbicane
that
his
projectile
was
not
nearing
the
moon
and
that
it
had
shifted
by
following
an
almost
concentric
curve
this
point
of
mark
was
a
luminous
brightness
which
nicholl
sighted
suddenly
on
the
limit
of
the
horizon
formed
by
the
black
disc
this
point
could
not
be
confounded
with
a
star
it
was
a
reddish
incandescence
which
increased
by
degrees
a
decided
proof
that
the
projectile
was
shifting
toward
it
and
not
falling
normally
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
a
volcano
it
is
a
volcano
in
action
cried
nicholl
a
disemboweling
of
the
interior
fires
of
the
moon
that
world
is
not
quite
extinguished
yes
an
eruption
replied
barbicane
who
was
carefully
studying
the
phenomenon
through
his
night
glass
what
should
it
be
if
not
a
volcano
but
then
said
michel
ardan
in
order
to
maintain
that
combustion
there
must
be
air
so
the
atmosphere
does
surround
that
part
of
the
moon
perhaps
so
replied
barbicane
but
not
necessarily
the
volcano
by
the
decomposition
of
certain
substances
can
provide
its
own
oxygen
and
thus
throw
flames
into
space
it
seems
to
me
that
the
deflagration
by
the
intense
brilliancy
of
the
substances
in
combustion
is
produced
in
pure
oxygen
we
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
proclaim
the
existence
of
a
lunar
atmosphere
the
fiery
mountain
must
have
been
situated
about
the
south
latitude
on
the
invisible
part
of
the
disc
but
to
great
displeasure
the
curve
which
the
projectile
was
describing
was
taking
it
far
from
the
point
indicated
by
the
eruption
thus
he
could
not
determine
its
nature
exactly
half
an
hour
after
being
sighted
this
luminous
point
had
disappeared
behind
the
dark
horizon
but
the
verification
of
this
phenomenon
was
of
considerable
consequence
in
their
selenographic
studies
it
proved
that
all
heat
had
not
yet
disappeared
from
the
bowels
of
this
globe
and
where
heat
exists
who
can
affirm
that
the
vegetable
kingdom
nay
even
the
animal
kingdom
itself
has
not
up
to
this
time
resisted
all
destructive
influences
the
existence
of
this
volcano
in
eruption
unmistakably
seen
by
these
earthly
savants
would
doubtless
give
rise
to
many
theories
favorable
to
the
grave
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
barbicane
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
these
reflections
he
forgot
himself
in
a
deep
reverie
in
which
the
mysterious
destiny
of
the
lunar
world
was
uppermost
he
was
seeking
to
combine
together
the
facts
observed
up
to
that
time
when
a
new
incident
recalled
him
briskly
to
reality
this
incident
was
more
than
a
cosmical
phenomenon
it
was
a
threatened
danger
the
consequence
of
which
might
be
disastrous
in
the
extreme
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
ether
in
the
profound
darkness
an
enormous
mass
appeared
it
was
like
a
moon
but
an
incandescent
moon
whose
brilliancy
was
all
the
more
intolerable
as
it
cut
sharply
on
the
frightful
darkness
of
space
this
mass
of
a
circular
form
threw
a
light
which
filled
the
projectile
the
forms
of
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
bathed
in
its
white
sheets
assumed
that
livid
spectral
appearance
which
physicians
produce
with
the
fictitious
light
of
alcohol
impregnated
with
salt
by
jove
cried
michel
ardan
we
are
hideous
what
is
that
moon
a
meteor
replied
barbicane
a
meteor
burning
in
space
yes
this
shooting
globe
suddenly
appearing
in
shadow
at
a
distance
of
at
most
miles
ought
according
to
barbicane
to
have
a
diameter
of
yards
it
advanced
at
a
speed
of
about
one
mile
and
a
half
per
second
it
cut
the
projectile
path
and
must
reach
it
in
some
minutes
as
it
approached
it
grew
to
enormous
proportions
imagine
if
possible
the
situation
of
the
travelers
it
is
impossible
to
describe
it
in
spite
of
their
courage
their
their
carelessness
of
danger
they
were
mute
motionless
with
stiffened
limbs
a
prey
to
frightful
terror
their
projectile
the
course
of
which
they
could
not
alter
was
rushing
straight
on
this
ignited
mass
more
intense
than
the
open
mouth
of
an
oven
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
being
precipitated
toward
an
abyss
of
fire
barbicane
had
seized
the
hands
of
his
two
companions
and
all
three
looked
through
their
eyelids
upon
that
asteroid
heated
to
a
white
heat
if
thought
was
not
destroyed
within
them
if
their
brains
still
worked
amid
all
this
awe
they
must
have
given
themselves
up
for
lost
two
minutes
after
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
meteor
to
them
two
centuries
of
anguish
the
projectile
seemed
almost
about
to
strike
it
when
the
globe
of
fire
burst
like
a
bomb
but
without
making
any
noise
in
that
void
where
sound
which
is
but
the
agitation
of
the
layers
of
air
could
not
be
generated
nicholl
uttered
a
cry
and
he
and
his
companions
rushed
to
the
scuttle
what
a
sight
what
pen
can
describe
it
what
palette
is
rich
enough
in
colors
to
reproduce
so
magnificent
a
spectacle
it
was
like
the
opening
of
a
crater
like
the
scattering
of
an
immense
conflagration
thousands
of
luminous
fragments
lit
up
and
irradiated
space
with
their
fires
every
size
every
color
was
there
intermingled
there
were
rays
of
yellow
and
pale
yellow
red
green
gray
a
crown
of
fireworks
of
all
colors
of
the
enormous
and
globe
there
remained
nothing
but
these
fragments
carried
in
all
directions
now
become
asteroids
in
their
turn
some
flaming
like
a
sword
some
surrounded
by
a
whitish
cloud
and
others
leaving
behind
them
trains
of
brilliant
cosmical
dust
these
incandescent
blocks
crossed
and
struck
each
other
scattering
still
smaller
fragments
some
of
which
struck
the
projectile
its
left
scuttle
was
even
cracked
by
a
violent
shock
it
seemed
to
be
floating
amid
a
hail
of
howitzer
shells
the
smallest
of
which
might
destroy
it
instantly
the
light
which
saturated
the
ether
was
so
wonderfully
intense
that
michel
drawing
barbicane
and
nicholl
to
his
window
exclaimed
the
invisible
moon
visible
at
last
and
through
a
luminous
emanation
which
lasted
some
seconds
the
whole
three
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
mysterious
disc
which
the
eye
of
man
now
saw
for
the
first
time
what
could
they
distinguish
at
a
distance
which
they
could
not
estimate
some
lengthened
bands
along
the
disc
real
clouds
formed
in
the
midst
of
a
very
confined
atmosphere
from
which
emerged
not
only
all
the
mountains
but
also
projections
of
less
importance
its
circles
its
yawning
craters
as
capriciously
placed
as
on
the
visible
surface
then
immense
spaces
no
longer
arid
plains
but
real
seas
oceans
widely
distributed
reflecting
on
their
liquid
surface
all
the
dazzling
magic
of
the
fires
of
space
and
lastly
on
the
surface
of
the
continents
large
dark
masses
looking
like
immense
forests
under
the
rapid
illumination
of
a
brilliance
was
it
an
illusion
a
mistake
an
optical
illusion
could
they
give
a
scientific
assent
to
an
observation
so
superficially
obtained
dared
they
pronounce
upon
the
question
of
its
habitability
after
so
slight
a
glimpse
of
the
invisible
disc
but
the
lightnings
in
space
subsided
by
degrees
its
accidental
brilliancy
died
away
the
asteroids
dispersed
in
different
directions
and
were
extinguished
in
the
distance
the
ether
returned
to
its
accustomed
darkness
the
stars
eclipsed
for
a
moment
again
twinkled
in
the
firmament
and
the
disc
so
hastily
discerned
was
again
buried
in
impenetrable
night
chapter
xvi
the
southern
hemisphere
the
projectile
had
just
escaped
a
terrible
danger
and
a
very
unforseen
one
who
would
have
thought
of
such
an
encounter
with
meteors
these
erring
bodies
might
create
serious
perils
for
the
travelers
they
were
to
them
so
many
sandbanks
upon
that
sea
of
ether
which
less
fortunate
than
sailors
they
could
not
escape
but
did
these
adventurers
complain
of
space
no
not
since
nature
had
given
them
the
splendid
sight
of
a
cosmical
meteor
bursting
from
expansion
since
this
inimitable
firework
which
no
ruggieri
could
imitate
had
lit
up
for
some
seconds
the
invisible
glory
of
the
moon
in
that
flash
continents
seas
and
forests
had
become
visible
to
them
did
an
atmosphere
then
bring
to
this
unknown
face
its
atoms
questions
still
insoluble
and
forever
closed
against
human
curiousity
it
was
then
three
in
the
afternoon
the
projectile
was
following
its
curvilinear
direction
round
the
moon
had
its
course
again
been
altered
by
the
meteor
it
was
to
be
feared
so
but
the
projectile
must
describe
a
curve
unalterably
determined
by
the
laws
of
mechanical
reasoning
barbicane
was
inclined
to
believe
that
this
curve
would
be
rather
a
parabola
than
a
hyperbola
but
admitting
the
parabola
the
projectile
must
quickly
have
passed
through
the
cone
of
shadow
projected
into
space
opposite
the
sun
this
cone
indeed
is
very
narrow
the
angular
diameter
of
the
moon
being
so
little
when
compared
with
the
diameter
of
the
orb
of
day
and
up
to
this
time
the
projectile
had
been
floating
in
this
deep
shadow
whatever
had
been
its
speed
and
it
could
not
have
been
insignificant
its
period
of
occultation
continued
that
was
evident
but
perhaps
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
in
a
supposedly
rigidly
parabolical
trajectory
a
new
problem
which
tormented
barbicane
brain
imprisoned
as
he
was
in
a
circle
of
unknowns
which
he
could
not
unravel
neither
of
the
travelers
thought
of
taking
an
instant
repose
each
one
watched
for
an
unexpected
fact
which
might
throw
some
new
light
on
their
uranographic
studies
about
five
michel
ardan
distributed
under
the
name
of
dinner
some
pieces
of
bread
and
cold
meat
which
were
quickly
swallowed
without
either
of
them
abandoning
their
scuttle
the
glass
of
which
was
incessantly
encrusted
by
the
condensation
of
vapor
about
minutes
past
five
in
the
evening
nicholl
armed
with
his
glass
sighted
toward
the
southern
border
of
the
moon
and
in
the
direction
followed
by
the
projectile
some
bright
points
cut
upon
the
dark
shield
of
the
sky
they
looked
like
a
succession
of
sharp
points
lengthened
into
a
tremulous
line
they
were
very
bright
such
appeared
the
terminal
line
of
the
moon
when
in
one
of
her
octants
they
could
not
be
mistaken
it
was
no
longer
a
simple
meteor
this
luminous
ridge
had
neither
color
nor
motion
nor
was
it
a
volcano
in
eruption
and
barbicane
did
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
upon
it
the
sun
he
exclaimed
what
the
sun
answered
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
yes
my
friends
it
is
the
radiant
orb
itself
lighting
up
the
summit
of
the
mountains
situated
on
the
southern
borders
of
the
moon
we
are
evidently
nearing
the
south
pole
after
having
passed
the
north
pole
replied
michel
we
have
made
the
circuit
of
our
satellite
then
yes
my
good
michel
then
no
more
hyperbolas
no
more
parabolas
no
more
open
curves
to
fear
no
but
a
closed
curve
which
is
called
an
ellipse
instead
of
losing
itself
in
interplanetary
space
it
is
probable
that
the
projectile
will
describe
an
elliptical
orbit
around
the
moon
indeed
and
that
it
will
become
satellite
moon
of
the
moon
cried
michel
ardan
only
i
would
have
you
observe
my
worthy
friend
replied
barbicane
that
we
are
none
the
less
lost
for
that
yes
in
another
manner
and
much
more
pleasantly
answered
the
careless
frenchman
with
his
most
amiable
smile
chapter
xvii
tycho
at
six
in
the
evening
the
projectile
passed
the
south
pole
at
less
than
forty
miles
off
a
distance
equal
to
that
already
reached
at
the
north
pole
the
elliptical
curve
was
being
rigidly
carried
out
at
this
moment
the
travelers
once
more
entered
the
blessed
rays
of
the
sun
they
saw
once
more
those
stars
which
move
slowly
from
east
to
west
the
radiant
orb
was
saluted
by
a
triple
hurrah
with
its
light
it
also
sent
heat
which
soon
pierced
the
metal
walls
the
glass
resumed
its
accustomed
appearance
the
layers
of
ice
melted
as
if
by
enchantment
and
immediately
for
economy
sake
the
gas
was
put
out
the
air
apparatus
alone
consuming
its
usual
quantity
ah
said
nicholl
these
rays
of
heat
are
good
with
what
impatience
must
the
selenites
wait
the
reappearance
of
the
orb
of
day
yes
replied
michel
ardan
imbibing
as
it
were
the
brilliant
ether
light
and
heat
all
life
is
contained
in
them
at
this
moment
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
deviated
somewhat
from
the
lunar
surface
in
order
to
follow
the
slightly
lengthened
elliptical
orbit
from
this
point
had
the
earth
been
at
the
full
barbicane
and
his
companions
could
have
seen
it
but
immersed
in
the
sun
irradiation
she
was
quite
invisible
another
spectacle
attracted
their
attention
that
of
the
southern
part
of
the
moon
brought
by
the
glasses
to
within
yards
they
did
not
again
leave
the
scuttles
and
noted
every
detail
of
this
fantastical
continent
mounts
doerful
and
leibnitz
formed
two
separate
groups
very
near
the
south
pole
the
first
group
extended
from
the
pole
to
the
parallel
on
the
eastern
part
of
the
orb
the
second
occupied
the
eastern
border
extending
from
the
of
latitude
to
the
pole
on
their
capriciously
formed
ridge
appeared
dazzling
sheets
as
mentioned
by
pere
secchi
with
more
certainty
than
the
illustrious
roman
astronomer
barbicane
was
enabled
to
recognize
their
nature
they
are
snow
he
exclaimed
snow
repeated
nicholl
yes
nicholl
snow
the
surface
of
which
is
deeply
frozen
see
how
they
reflect
the
luminous
rays
cooled
lava
would
never
give
out
such
intense
reflection
there
must
then
be
water
there
must
be
air
on
the
moon
as
little
as
you
please
but
the
fact
can
no
longer
be
contested
no
it
could
not
be
and
if
ever
barbicane
should
see
the
earth
again
his
notes
will
bear
witness
to
this
great
fact
in
his
selenographic
observations
these
mountains
of
doerful
and
leibnitz
rose
in
the
midst
of
plains
of
a
medium
extent
which
were
bounded
by
an
indefinite
succession
of
circles
and
annular
ramparts
these
two
chains
are
the
only
ones
met
with
in
this
region
of
circles
comparatively
but
slightly
marked
they
throw
up
here
and
there
some
sharp
points
the
highest
summit
of
which
attains
an
altitude
of
feet
but
the
projectile
was
high
above
all
this
landscape
and
the
projections
disappeared
in
the
intense
brilliancy
of
the
disc
and
to
the
eyes
of
the
travelers
there
reappeared
that
original
aspect
of
the
lunar
landscapes
raw
in
tone
without
gradation
of
colors
and
without
degrees
of
shadow
roughly
black
and
white
from
the
want
of
diffusion
of
light
but
the
sight
of
this
desolate
world
did
not
fail
to
captivate
them
by
its
very
strangeness
they
were
moving
over
this
region
as
if
they
had
been
borne
on
the
breath
of
some
storm
watching
heights
defile
under
their
feet
piercing
the
cavities
with
their
eyes
going
down
into
the
rifts
climbing
the
ramparts
sounding
these
mysterious
holes
and
leveling
all
cracks
but
no
trace
of
vegetation
no
appearance
of
cities
nothing
but
stratification
beds
of
lava
overflowings
polished
like
immense
mirrors
reflecting
the
sun
rays
with
overpowering
brilliancy
nothing
belonging
to
a
world
everything
to
a
dead
world
where
avalanches
rolling
from
the
summits
of
the
mountains
would
disperse
noiselessly
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
retaining
the
motion
but
wanting
the
sound
in
any
case
it
was
the
image
of
death
without
its
being
possible
even
to
say
that
life
had
ever
existed
there
michel
ardan
however
thought
he
recognized
a
heap
of
ruins
to
which
he
drew
barbicane
attention
it
was
about
the
parallel
in
longitude
this
heap
of
stones
rather
regularly
placed
represented
a
vast
fortress
overlooking
a
long
rift
which
in
former
days
had
served
as
a
bed
to
the
rivers
of
prehistorical
times
not
far
from
that
rose
to
a
height
of
feet
the
annular
mountain
of
short
equal
to
the
asiatic
caucasus
michel
ardan
with
his
accustomed
ardor
maintained
the
evidences
of
his
fortress
beneath
it
he
discerned
the
dismantled
ramparts
of
a
town
here
the
still
intact
arch
of
a
portico
there
two
or
three
columns
lying
under
their
base
farther
on
a
succession
of
arches
which
must
have
supported
the
conduit
of
an
aqueduct
in
another
part
the
sunken
pillars
of
a
gigantic
bridge
run
into
the
thickest
parts
of
the
rift
he
distinguished
all
this
but
with
so
much
imagination
in
his
glance
and
through
glasses
so
fantastical
that
we
must
mistrust
his
observation
but
who
could
affirm
who
would
dare
to
say
that
the
amiable
fellow
did
not
really
see
that
which
his
two
companions
would
not
see
moments
were
too
precious
to
be
sacrificed
in
idle
discussion
the
selenite
city
whether
imaginary
or
not
had
already
disappeared
afar
off
the
distance
of
the
projectile
from
the
lunar
disc
was
on
the
increase
and
the
details
of
the
soil
were
being
lost
in
a
confused
jumble
the
reliefs
the
circles
the
craters
and
the
plains
alone
remained
and
still
showed
their
boundary
lines
distinctly
at
this
moment
to
the
left
lay
extended
one
of
the
finest
circles
of
lunar
orography
one
of
the
curiosities
of
this
continent
it
was
newton
which
barbicane
recognized
without
trouble
by
referring
to
the
newton
is
situated
in
exactly
south
latitude
and
east
longitude
it
forms
an
annular
crater
the
ramparts
of
which
rising
to
a
height
of
feet
seemed
to
be
impassable
barbicane
made
his
companions
observe
that
the
height
of
this
mountain
above
the
surrounding
plain
was
far
from
equaling
the
depth
of
its
crater
this
enormous
hole
was
beyond
all
measurement
and
formed
a
gloomy
abyss
the
bottom
of
which
the
sun
rays
could
never
reach
there
according
to
humboldt
reigns
utter
darkness
which
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
can
not
break
mythologists
could
well
have
made
it
the
mouth
of
hell
newton
said
barbicane
is
the
most
perfect
type
of
these
annular
mountains
of
which
the
earth
possesses
no
sample
they
prove
that
the
moon
formation
by
means
of
cooling
is
due
to
violent
causes
for
while
under
the
pressure
of
internal
fires
the
reliefs
rise
to
considerable
height
the
depths
withdraw
far
below
the
lunar
level
i
do
not
dispute
the
fact
replied
michel
ardan
some
minutes
after
passing
newton
the
projectile
directly
overlooked
the
annular
mountains
of
moret
it
skirted
at
some
distance
the
summits
of
blancanus
and
at
about
seven
in
the
evening
reached
the
circle
of
clavius
this
circle
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
the
disc
is
situated
in
south
latitude
and
east
longitude
its
height
is
estimated
at
feet
the
travelers
at
a
distance
of
miles
reduced
to
four
by
their
glasses
could
admire
this
vast
crater
in
its
entirety
terrestrial
volcanoes
said
barbicane
are
but
compared
with
those
of
the
moon
measuring
the
old
craters
formed
by
the
first
eruptions
of
vesuvius
and
etna
we
find
them
little
more
than
three
miles
in
breadth
in
france
the
circle
of
cantal
measures
six
miles
across
at
ceyland
the
circle
of
the
island
is
forty
miles
which
is
considered
the
largest
on
the
globe
what
are
these
diameters
against
that
of
clavius
which
we
overlook
at
this
moment
what
is
its
breadth
asked
nicholl
it
is
miles
replied
barbicane
this
circle
is
certainly
the
most
important
on
the
moon
but
many
others
measure
or
miles
ah
my
friends
exclaimed
michel
can
you
picture
to
yourselves
what
this
now
peaceful
orb
of
night
must
have
been
when
its
craters
filled
with
thunderings
vomited
at
the
same
time
smoke
and
tongues
of
flame
what
a
wonderful
spectacle
then
and
now
what
decay
this
moon
is
nothing
more
than
a
thin
carcase
of
fireworks
whose
squibs
rockets
serpents
and
suns
after
a
superb
brilliancy
have
left
but
sadly
broken
cases
who
can
say
the
cause
the
reason
the
motive
force
of
these
cataclysms
barbicane
was
not
listening
to
michel
ardan
he
was
contemplating
these
ramparts
of
clavius
formed
by
large
mountains
spread
over
several
miles
at
the
bottom
of
the
immense
cavity
burrowed
hundreds
of
small
extinguished
craters
riddling
the
soil
like
a
colander
and
overlooked
by
a
peak
feet
high
around
the
plain
appeared
desolate
nothing
so
arid
as
these
reliefs
nothing
so
sad
as
these
ruins
of
mountains
and
if
we
may
so
express
ourselves
these
fragments
of
peaks
and
mountains
which
strewed
the
soil
the
satellite
seemed
to
have
burst
at
this
spot
the
projectile
was
still
advancing
and
this
movement
did
not
subside
circles
craters
and
uprooted
mountains
succeeded
each
other
incessantly
no
more
plains
no
more
seas
a
never
ending
switzerland
and
norway
and
lastly
in
the
canter
of
this
region
of
crevasses
the
most
splendid
mountain
on
the
lunar
disc
the
dazzling
tycho
in
which
posterity
will
ever
preserve
the
name
of
the
illustrious
danish
astronomer
in
observing
the
full
moon
in
a
cloudless
sky
no
one
has
failed
to
remark
this
brilliant
point
of
the
southern
hemisphere
michel
ardan
used
every
metaphor
that
his
imagination
could
supply
to
designate
it
by
to
him
this
tycho
was
a
focus
of
light
a
center
of
irradiation
a
crater
vomiting
rays
it
was
the
tire
of
a
brilliant
wheel
an
enclosing
the
disc
with
its
silver
tentacles
an
enormous
eye
filled
with
flames
a
glory
carved
for
pluto
head
a
star
launched
by
the
creator
hand
and
crushed
against
the
face
of
the
moon
tycho
forms
such
a
concentration
of
light
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
can
see
it
without
glasses
though
at
a
distance
of
miles
imagine
then
its
intensity
to
the
eye
of
observers
placed
at
a
distance
of
only
fifty
miles
seen
through
this
pure
ether
its
brilliancy
was
so
intolerable
that
barbicane
and
his
friends
were
obliged
to
blacken
their
glasses
with
the
gas
smoke
before
they
could
bear
the
splendor
then
silent
scarcely
uttering
an
interjection
of
admiration
they
gazed
they
contemplated
all
their
feelings
all
their
impressions
were
concentrated
in
that
look
as
under
any
violent
emotion
all
life
is
concentrated
at
the
heart
tycho
belongs
to
the
system
of
radiating
mountains
like
aristarchus
and
copernicus
but
it
is
of
all
the
most
complete
and
decided
showing
unquestionably
the
frightful
volcanic
action
to
which
the
formation
of
the
moon
is
due
tycho
is
situated
in
south
latitude
and
east
longitude
its
center
is
occupied
by
a
crater
fifty
miles
broad
it
assumes
a
slightly
elliptical
form
and
is
surrounded
by
an
enclosure
of
annular
ramparts
which
on
the
east
and
west
overlook
the
outer
plain
from
a
height
of
feet
it
is
a
group
of
mont
blancs
placed
round
one
common
center
and
crowned
by
radiating
beams
what
this
incomparable
mountain
really
is
with
all
the
projections
converging
toward
it
and
the
interior
excrescences
of
its
crater
photography
itself
could
never
represent
indeed
it
is
during
the
full
moon
that
tycho
is
seen
in
all
its
splendor
then
all
shadows
disappear
the
foreshortening
of
perspective
disappears
and
all
proofs
become
white
a
disagreeable
fact
for
this
strange
region
would
have
been
marvelous
if
reproduced
with
photographic
exactness
it
is
but
a
group
of
hollows
craters
circles
a
network
of
crests
then
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
a
whole
volcanic
network
cast
upon
this
encrusted
soil
one
can
then
understand
that
the
bubbles
of
this
central
eruption
have
kept
their
first
form
crystallized
by
cooling
they
have
stereotyped
that
aspect
which
the
moon
formerly
presented
when
under
the
plutonian
forces
the
distance
which
separated
the
travelers
from
the
annular
summits
of
tycho
was
not
so
great
but
that
they
could
catch
the
principal
details
even
on
the
causeway
forming
the
fortifications
of
tycho
the
mountains
hanging
on
to
the
interior
and
exterior
sloping
flanks
rose
in
stories
like
gigantic
terraces
they
appeared
to
be
higher
by
or
feet
to
the
west
than
to
the
east
no
system
of
terrestrial
encampment
could
equal
these
natural
fortifications
a
town
built
at
the
bottom
of
this
circular
cavity
would
have
been
utterly
inaccessible
inaccessible
and
wonderfully
extended
over
this
soil
covered
with
picturesque
projections
indeed
nature
had
not
left
the
bottom
of
this
crater
flat
and
empty
it
possessed
its
own
peculiar
orography
a
mountainous
system
making
it
a
world
in
itself
the
travelers
could
distinguish
clearly
cones
central
hills
remarkable
positions
of
the
soil
naturally
placed
to
receive
the
of
selenite
architecture
there
was
marked
out

the

the

a
vast

which
ancient

could
have
been
held
in
its
entirety
ten
times
over
ah
exclaimed
michel
ardan
enthusiastic
at
the
sight
what
a
grand
town
might
be
constructed
within
that
ring
of
mountains
a
quiet
city
a
peaceful
refuge
beyond
all
human
misery
how
calm
and
isolated
those
misanthropes
those
haters
of
humanity
might
live
there
and
all
who
have
a
distaste
for
social
life
all
it
would
be
too
small
for
them
replied
barbicane
simply
chapter
xviii
grave
questions
but
the
projectile
had
passed
the
of
tycho
and
barbicane
and
his
two
companions
watched
with
scrupulous
attention
the
brilliant
rays
which
the
celebrated
mountain
shed
so
curiously
over
the
horizon
what
was
this
radiant
glory
what
geological
phenomenon
had
designed
these
ardent
beams
this
question
occupied
barbicane
mind
under
his
eyes
ran
in
all
directions
luminous
furrows
raised
at
the
edges
and
concave
in
the
center
some
twelve
miles
others
thirty
miles
broad
these
brilliant
trains
extended
in
some
places
to
within
miles
of
tycho
and
seemed
to
cover
particularly
toward
the
east
the
northeast
and
the
north
the
half
of
the
southern
hemisphere
one
of
these
jets
extended
as
far
as
the
circle
of
neander
situated
on
the

by
a
slight

furrowed
the

breaking
against
the

after

circuit
of
miles
others
toward
the
west
covered
the
sea
of
clouds
and
the
sea
of
humors
with
a
luminous
network
what
was
the
origin
of
these
sparkling
rays
which
shone
on
the
plains
as
well
as
on
the

whatever
height
they
might
be
all
started
from

the

of

they
sprang
from
him
herschel
attributed
their
brilliancy
to
currents
of
lava
congealed
by
the
cold
an
opinion
however
which
has
not
been
generally
adopted
other
astronomers
have
seen
in
these
inexplicable
rays
a
kind
of
moraines
rows
of
erratic
blocks
which
had
been
thrown
up
at
the
period
of
tycho
formation
and
why
not
asked
nicholl
of
barbicane
who
was
relating
and
rejecting
these
different
opinions
because
the
regularity
of
these
luminous
lines
and
the
violence
necessary
to
carry
volcanic
matter
to
such
distances
is
inexplicable
eh

michel

it
seems
easy
enough
to
me
to
explain
the
origin
of
these
rays
indeed
said
barbicane
indeed
continued
michel
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
is
a
vast
star
similar
to
that
produced
by
a
ball
or
a
stone
thrown
at
a
square
of
glass
well
replied
barbicane
smiling
and
what
hand
would
be
powerful
enough
to
throw
a
ball
to
give
such
a
shock
as
that
the
hand
is
not
necessary
answered
nicholl
not
at
all
confounded
and
as
to
the
stone
let
us
suppose
it
to
be
a
comet
ah
those
comets
exclaimed
barbicane
my
brave
michel
your
explanation
is
not
bad
but
your
comet
is
useless
the
shock
which
produced
that
rent
must
have
some
from
the
inside
of
the
star
a
violent
contraction
of
the
lunar
crust
while
cooling
might
suffice
to
imprint
this
gigantic
star
a
contraction
something
like
a
lunar
said
michel
ardan
besides
added
barbicane
this
opinion
is
that
of
an
english
savant
nasmyth
and
it
seems
to
me
to
sufficiently
explain
the
radiation
of
these
mountains
that
nasmyth
was
no
fool
replied
michel
long
did
the
travelers
whom
such
a
sight
could
never
weary
admire
the
splendors
of
tycho
their
projectile
saturated
with
luminous
gleams
in
the
double
irradiation
of
sun
and
moon
must
have
appeared
like
an
incandescent
globe
they
had
passed
suddenly
from
excessive
cold
to
intense
heat
nature
was
thus
preparing
them
to
become
selenites
become
selenites
that
idea
brought
up
once
more
the
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
after
what
they
had
seen
could
the
travelers
solve
it
would
they
decide
for
or
against
it
michel
ardan
persuaded
his
two
friends
to
form
an
opinion
and
asked
them
directly
if
they
thought
that
men
and
animals
were
represented
in
the
lunar
world
i
think
that
we
can
answer
said
barbicane
but
according
to
my
idea
the
question
ought
not
to
be
put
in
that
form
i
ask
it
to
be
put
differently
put
it
your
own
way
replied
michel
here
it
is
continued
barbicane
the
problem
is
a
double
one
and
requires
a
double
solution
is
the
moon
has
the
moon
ever
been
good
replied
nicholl
first
let
us
see
whether
the
moon
is
habitable
to
tell
the
truth
i
know
nothing
about
it
answered
michel
and
i
answer
in
the
negative
continued
barbicane
in
her
actual
state
with
her
surrounding
atmosphere
certainly
very
much
reduced
her
seas
for
the
most
part
dried
up
her
insufficient
supply
of
water
restricted
vegetation
sudden
alternations
of
cold
and
heat
her
days
and
nights
of
hours
the
moon
does
not
seem
habitable
to
me
nor
does
she
seem
propitious
to
animal
development
nor
sufficient
for
the
wants
of
existence
as
we
understand
it
agreed
replied
nicholl
but
is
not
the
moon
habitable
for
creatures
differently
organized
from
ourselves
that
question
is
more
difficult
to
answer
but
i
will
try
and
i
ask
nicholl
if
appears
to
him
to
be
a
necessary
result
of
whatever
be
its
organization
without
a
doubt
answered
nicholl
then
my
worthy
companion
i
would
answer
that
we
have
observed
the
lunar
continent
at
a
distance
of
yards
at
most
and
that
nothing
seemed
to
us
to
move
on
the
moon
surface
the
presence
of
any
kind
of
life
would
have
been
betrayed
by
its
attendant
marks
such
as
divers
buildings
and
even
by
ruins
and
what
have
we
seen
everywhere
and
always
the
geological
works
of
nature
never
the
work
of
man
if
then
there
exist
representatives
of
the
animal
kingdom
on
the
moon
they
must
have
fled
to
those
unfathomable
cavities
which
the
eye
can
not
reach
which
i
can
not
admit
for
they
must
have
left
traces
of
their
passage
on
those
plains
which
the
atmosphere
must
cover
however
slightly
raised
it
may
be
these
traces
are
nowhere
visible
there
remains
but
one
hypothesis
that
of
a
living
race
to
which
motion
which
is
life
is
foreign
one
might
as
well
say
living
creatures
which
do
not
live
replied
michel
just
so
said
barbicane
which
for
us
has
no
meaning
then
we
may
form
our
opinion
said
michel
yes
replied
nicholl
very
well
continued
michel
ardan
the
scientific
commission
assembled
in
the
projectile
of
the
gun
club
after
having
founded
their
argument
on
facts
recently
observed
decide
unanimously
upon
the
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
the
moon
is
not
habitable
this
decision
was
consigned
by
president
barbicane
to
his
notebook
where
the
process
of
the
sitting
of
the
of
december
may
be
seen
now
said
nicholl
let
us
attack
the
second
question
an
indispensable
complement
of
the
first
i
ask
the
honorable
commission
if
the
moon
is
not
habitable
has
she
ever
been
inhabited
citizen
barbicane
my
friends
replied
barbicane
i
did
not
undertake
this
journey
in
order
to
form
an
opinion
on
the
past
habitability
of
our
satellite
but
i
will
add
that
our
personal
observations
only
confirm
me
in
this
opinion
i
believe
indeed
i
affirm
that
the
moon
has
been
inhabited
by
a
human
race
organized
like
our
own
that
she
has
produced
animals
anatomically
formed
like
the
terrestrial
animals
but
i
add
that
these
races
human
and
animal
have
had
their
day
and
are
now
forever
extinct
then
asked
michel
the
moon
must
be
older
than
the
earth
no
said
barbicane
decidedly
but
a
world
which
has
grown
old
quicker
and
whose
formation
and
deformation
have
been
more
rapid
relatively
the
organizing
force
of
matter
has
been
much
more
violent
in
the
interior
of
the
moon
than
in
the
interior
of
the
terrestrial
globe
the
actual
state
of
this
cracked
twisted
and
burst
disc
abundantly
proves
this
the
moon
and
the
earth
were
nothing
but
gaseous
masses
originally
these
gases
have
passed
into
a
liquid
state
under
different
influences
and
the
solid
masses
have
been
formed
later
but
most
certainly
our
sphere
was
still
gaseous
or
liquid
when
the
moon
was
solidified
by
cooling
and
had
become
habitable
i
believe
it
said
nicholl
then
continued
barbicane
an
atmosphere
surrounded
it
the
waters
contained
within
this
gaseous
envelope
could
not
evaporate
under
the
influence
of
air
water
light
solar
heat
and
central
heat
vegetation
took
possession
of
the
continents
prepared
to
receive
it
and
certainly
life
showed
itself
about
this
period
for
nature
does
not
expend
herself
in
vain
and
a
world
so
wonderfully
formed
for
habitation
must
necessarily
be
inhabited
but
said
nicholl
many
phenomena
inherent
in
our
satellite
might
cramp
the
expansion
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdom
for
example
its
days
and
nights
of
hours
at
the
terrestrial
poles
they
last
six
months
said
michel
an
argument
of
little
value
since
the
poles
are
not
inhabited
let
us
observe
my
friends
continued
barbicane
that
if
in
the
actual
state
of
the
moon
its
long
nights
and
long
days
created
differences
of
temperature
insupportable
to
organization
it
was
not
so
at
the
historical
period
of
time
the
atmosphere
enveloped
the
disc
with
a
fluid
mantle
vapor
deposited
itself
in
the
shape
of
clouds
this
natural
screen
tempered
the
ardor
of
the
solar
rays
and
retained
the
nocturnal
radiation
light
like
heat
can
diffuse
itself
in
the
air
hence
an
equality
between
the
influences
which
no
longer
exists
now
that
atmosphere
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
and
now
i
am
going
to
astonish
you
astonish
us
said
michel
ardan
i
firmly
believe
that
at
the
period
when
the
moon
was
inhabited
the
nights
and
days
did
not
last
hours
and
why
asked
nicholl
quickly
because
most
probably
then
the
rotary
motion
of
the
moon
upon
her
axis
was
not
equal
to
her
revolution
an
equality
which
presents
each
part
of
her
disc
during
fifteen
days
to
the
action
of
the
solar
rays
granted
replied
nicholl
but
why
should
not
these
two
motions
have
been
equal
as
they
are
really
so
because
that
equality
has
only
been
determined
by
terrestrial
attraction
and
who
can
say
that
this
attraction
was
powerful
enough
to
alter
the
motion
of
the
moon
at
that
period
when
the
earth
was
still
fluid
just
so
replied
nicholl
and
who
can
say
that
the
moon
has
always
been
a
satellite
of
the
earth
and
who
can
say
exclaimed
michel
ardan
that
the
moon
did
not
exist
before
the
earth
their
imaginations
carried
them
away
into
an
indefinite
field
of
hypothesis
barbicane
sought
to
restrain
them
those
speculations
are
too
high
said
he
problems
utterly
insoluble
do
not
let
us
enter
upon
them
let
us
only
admit
the
insufficiency
of
the
primordial
attraction
and
then
by
the
inequality
of
the
two
motions
of
rotation
and
revolution
the
days
and
nights
could
have
succeeded
each
other
on
the
moon
as
they
succeed
each
other
on
the
earth
besides
even
without
these
conditions
life
was
possible
and
so
asked
michel
ardan
humanity
has
disappeared
from
the
moon
yes
replied
barbicane
after
having
doubtless
remained
persistently
for
millions
of
centuries
by
degrees
the
atmosphere
becoming
rarefied
the
disc
became
uninhabitable
as
the
terrestrial
globe
will
one
day
become
by
cooling
by
cooling
certainly
replied
barbicane
as
the
internal
fires
became
extinguished
and
the
incandescent
matter
concentrated
itself
the
lunar
crust
cooled
by
degrees
the
consequences
of
these
phenomena
showed
themselves
in
the
disappearance
of
organized
beings
and
by
the
disappearance
of
vegetation
soon
the
atmosphere
was
rarefied
probably
withdrawn
by
terrestrial
attraction
then
aerial
departure
of
respirable
air
and
disappearance
of
water
by
means
of
evaporation
at
this
period
the
moon
becoming
uninhabitable
was
no
longer
inhabited
it
was
a
dead
world
such
as
we
see
it
and
you
say
that
the
same
fate
is
in
store
for
the
earth
most
probably
but
when
when
the
cooling
of
its
crust
shall
have
made
it
uninhabitable
and
have
they
calculated
the
time
which
our
unfortunate
sphere
will
take
to
cool
certainly
and
you
know
these
calculations
perfectly
but
speak
then
my
clumsy
savant
exclaimed
michel
ardan
for
you
make
me
boil
with
impatience
very
well
my
good
michel
replied
barbicane
quietly
we
know
what
diminution
of
temperature
the
earth
undergoes
in
the
lapse
of
a
century
and
according
to
certain
calculations
this
mean
temperature
will
after
a
period
of
years
be
brought
down
to
zero
four
hundred
thousand
years
exclaimed
michel
ah
i
breathe
again
really
i
was
frightened
to
hear
you
i
imagined
that
we
had
not
more
than
years
to
live
barbicane
and
nicholl
could
not
help
laughing
at
their
companion
uneasiness
then
nicholl
who
wished
to
end
the
discussion
put
the
second
question
which
had
just
been
considered
again
has
the
moon
been
inhabited
he
asked
the
answer
was
unanimously
in
the
affirmative
but
during
this
discussion
fruitful
in
somewhat
hazardous
theories
the
projectile
was
rapidly
leaving
the
moon
the
lineaments
faded
away
from
the
travelers
eyes
mountains
were
confused
in
the
distance
and
of
all
the
wonderful
strange
and
fantastical
form
of
the
earth
satellite
there
soon
remained
nothing
but
the
imperishable
remembrance
chapter
xix
a
struggle
against
the
impossible
for
a
long
time
barbicane
and
his
companions
looked
silently
and
sadly
upon
that
world
which
they
had
only
seen
from
a
distance
as
moses
saw
the
land
of
canaan
and
which
they
were
leaving
without
a
possibility
of
ever
returning
to
it
the
position
with
regard
to
the
moon
had
altered
and
the
base
was
now
turned
to
the
earth
this
change
which
barbicane
verified
did
not
fail
to
surprise
them
if
the
projectile
was
to
gravitate
round
the
satellite
in
an
elliptical
orbit
why
was
not
its
heaviest
part
turned
toward
it
as
the
moon
turns
hers
to
the
earth
that
was
a
difficult
point
in
watching
the
course
of
the
projectile
they
could
see
that
on
leaving
the
moon
it
followed
a
course
analogous
to
that
traced
in
approaching
her
it
was
describing
a
very
long
ellipse
which
would
most
likely
extend
to
the
point
of
equal
attraction
where
the
influences
of
the
earth
and
its
satellite
are
neutralized
such
was
the
conclusion
which
barbicane
very
justly
drew
from
facts
already
observed
a
conviction
which
his
two
friends
shared
with
him
and
when
arrived
at
this
dead
point
what
will
become
of
us
asked
michel
ardan
we
do
know
replied
barbicane
but
one
can
draw
some
hypotheses
i
suppose
two
answered
barbicane
either
the
projectile
speed
will
be
insufficient
and
it
will
remain
forever
immovable
on
this
line
of
double
attraction
i
prefer
the
other
hypothesis
whatever
it
may
be
interrupted
michel
or
continued
barbicane
its
speed
will
be
sufficient
and
it
will
continue
its
elliptical
course
to
gravitate
forever
around
the
orb
of
night
a
revolution
not
at
all
consoling
said
michel
to
pass
to
the
state
of
humble
servants
to
a
moon
whom
we
are
accustomed
to
look
upon
as
our
own
handmaid
so
that
is
the
fate
in
store
for
us
neither
barbicane
nor
nicholl
answered
you
do
not
answer
continued
michel
impatiently
there
is
nothing
to
answer
said
nicholl
is
there
nothing
to
try
no
answered
barbicane
do
you
pretend
to
fight
against
the
impossible
why
not
do
one
frenchman
and
two
americans
shrink
from
such
a
word
but
what
would
you
do
subdue
this
motion
which
is
bearing
us
away
subdue
it
yes
continued
michel
getting
animated
or
else
alter
it
and
employ
it
to
the
accomplishment
of
our
own
ends
and
how
that
is
your
affair
if
artillerymen
are
not
masters
of
their
projectile
they
are
not
artillerymen
if
the
projectile
is
to
command
the
gunner
we
had
better
ram
the
gunner
into
the
gun
my
faith
fine
savants
who
do
not
know
what
is
to
become
of
us
after
inducing
me
inducing
you
cried
barbicane
and
nicholl
inducing
you
what
do
you
mean
by
that
no
recrimination
said
michel
i
do
not
complain
the
trip
has
pleased
me
and
the
projectile
agrees
with
me
but
let
us
do
all
that
is
humanly
possible
to
do
the
fall
somewhere
even
if
only
on
the
moon
we
ask
no
better
my
worthy
michel
replied
barbicane
but
means
fail
us
we
can
not
alter
the
motion
of
the
projectile
no
nor
diminish
its
speed
no
not
even
by
lightening
it
as
they
lighten
an
overloaded
vessel
what
would
you
throw
out
said
nicholl
we
have
no
ballast
on
board
and
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
if
lightened
it
would
go
much
quicker
slower
quicker
neither
slower
nor
quicker
said
barbicane
wishing
to
make
his
two
friends
agree
for
we
float
is
space
and
must
no
longer
consider
specific
weight
very
well
cried
michel
ardan
in
a
decided
voice
then
their
remains
but
one
thing
to
do
what
is
it
asked
nicholl
breakfast
answered
the
cool
audacious
frenchman
who
always
brought
up
this
solution
at
the
most
difficult
juncture
in
any
case
if
this
operation
had
no
influence
on
the
projectile
course
it
could
at
least
be
tried
without
inconvenience
and
even
with
success
from
a
stomachic
point
of
view
certainly
michel
had
none
but
good
ideas
they
breakfasted
then
at
two
in
the
morning
the
hour
mattered
little
michel
served
his
usual
repast
crowned
by
a
glorious
bottle
drawn
from
his
private
cellar
if
ideas
did
not
crowd
on
their
brains
we
must
despair
of
the
chambertin
of
the
repast
finished
observation
began
again
around
the
projectile
at
an
invariable
distance
were
the
objects
which
had
been
thrown
out
evidently
in
its
translatory
motion
round
the
moon
it
had
not
passed
through
any
atmosphere
for
the
specific
weight
of
these
different
objects
would
have
checked
their
relative
speed
on
the
side
of
the
terrestrial
sphere
nothing
was
to
be
seen
the
earth
was
but
a
day
old
having
been
new
the
night
before
at
twelve
and
two
days
must
elapse
before
its
crescent
freed
from
the
solar
rays
would
serve
as
a
clock
to
the
selenites
as
in
its
rotary
movement
each
of
its
points
after
hours
repasses
the
same
lunar
meridian
on
the
moon
side
the
sight
was
different
the
orb
shone
in
all
her
splendor
amid
innumerable
constellations
whose
purity
could
not
be
troubled
by
her
rays
on
the
disc
the
plains
were
already
returning
to
the
dark
tint
which
is
seen
from
the
earth
the
other
part
of
the
nimbus
remained
brilliant
and
in
the
midst
of
this
general
brilliancy
tycho
shone
prominently
like
a
sun
barbicane
had
no
means
of
estimating
the
projectile
speed
but
reasoning
showed
that
it
must
uniformly
decrease
according
to
the
laws
of
mechanical
reasoning
having
admitted
that
the
projectile
was
describing
an
orbit
around
the
moon
this
orbit
must
necessarily
be
elliptical
science
proves
that
it
must
be
so
no
motive
body
circulating
round
an
attracting
body
fails
in
this
law
every
orbit
described
in
space
is
elliptical
and
why
should
the
projectile
of
the
gun
club
escape
this
natural
arrangement
in
elliptical
orbits
the
attracting
body
always
occupies
one
of
the
foci
so
that
at
one
moment
the
satellite
is
nearer
and
at
another
farther
from
the
orb
around
which
it
gravitates
when
the
earth
is
nearest
the
sun
she
is
in
her
perihelion
and
in
her
aphelion
at
the
farthest
point
speaking
of
the
moon
she
is
nearest
to
the
earth
in
her
perigee
and
farthest
from
it
in
her
apogee
to
use
analogous
expressions
with
which
the
astronomers
language
is
enriched
if
the
projectile
remains
as
a
satellite
of
the
moon
we
must
say
that
it
is
in
its
aposelene
at
its
farthest
point
and
in
its
periselene
at
its
nearest
in
the
latter
case
the
projectile
would
attain
its
maximum
of
speed
and
in
the
former
its
minimum
it
was
evidently
moving
toward
its
aposelenitical
point
and
barbicane
had
reason
to
think
that
its
speed
would
decrease
up
to
this
point
and
then
increase
by
degrees
as
it
neared
the
moon
this
speed
would
even
become
if
this
point
joined
that
of
equal
attraction
barbicane
studied
the
consequences
of
these
different
situations
and
thinking
what
inference
he
could
draw
from
them
when
he
was
roughly
disturbed
by
a
cry
from
michel
ardan
by
jove
he
exclaimed
i
must
admit
we
are
simpletons
i
do
not
say
we
are
not
replied
barbicane
but
why
because
we
have
a
very
simple
means
of
checking
this
speed
which
is
bearing
us
from
the
moon
and
we
do
not
use
it
and
what
is
the
means
to
use
the
recoil
contained
in
our
rockets
done
said
nicholl
we
have
not
used
this
force
yet
said
barbicane
it
is
true
but
we
will
do
so
when
asked
michel
when
the
time
comes
observe
my
friends
that
in
the
position
occupied
by
the
projectile
an
oblique
position
with
regard
to
the
lunar
disc
our
rockets
in
slightly
altering
its
direction
might
turn
it
from
the
moon
instead
of
drawing
it
nearer
just
so
replied
michel
let
us
wait
then
by
some
inexplicable
influence
the
projectile
is
turning
its
base
toward
the
earth
it
is
probable
that
at
the
point
of
equal
attraction
its
conical
cap
will
be
directed
rigidly
toward
the
moon
at
that
moment
we
may
hope
that
its
speed
will
be
then
will
be
the
moment
to
act
and
with
the
influence
of
our
rockets
we
may
perhaps
provoke
a
fall
directly
on
the
surface
of
the
lunar
disc
bravo
said
michel
what
we
did
not
do
what
we
could
not
do
on
our
first
passage
at
the
dead
point
because
the
projectile
was
then
endowed
with
too
great
a
speed
very
well
reasoned
said
nicholl
let
us
wait
patiently
continued
barbicane
putting
every
chance
on
our
side
and
after
having
so
much
despaired
i
may
say
i
think
we
shall
gain
our
end
this
conclusion
was
a
signal
for
michel
ardan
hips
and
hurrahs
and
none
of
the
audacious
boobies
remembered
the
question
that
they
themselves
had
solved
in
the
negative
no
the
moon
is
not
inhabited
no
the
moon
is
probably
not
habitable
and
yet
they
were
going
to
try
everything
to
reach
her
one
single
question
remained
to
be
solved
at
what
precise
moment
the
projectile
would
reach
the
point
of
equal
attraction
on
which
the
travelers
must
play
their
last
card
in
order
to
calculate
this
to
within
a
few
seconds
barbicane
had
only
to
refer
to
his
notes
and
to
reckon
the
different
heights
taken
on
the
lunar
parallels
thus
the
time
necessary
to
travel
over
the
distance
between
the
dead
point
and
the
south
pole
would
be
equal
to
the
distance
separating
the
north
pole
from
the
dead
point
the
hours
representing
the
time
traveled
over
were
carefully
noted
and
the
calculation
was
easy
barbicane
found
that
this
point
would
be
reached
at
one
in
the
morning
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
so
that
if
nothing
interfered
with
its
course
it
would
reach
the
given
point
in
hours
the
rockets
had
primarily
been
placed
to
check
the
fall
of
the
projectile
upon
the
moon
and
now
they
were
going
to
employ
them
for
a
directly
contrary
purpose
in
any
case
they
were
ready
and
they
had
only
to
wait
for
the
moment
to
set
fire
to
them
since
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
said
nicholl
i
make
a
proposition
what
is
it
asked
barbicane
i
propose
to
go
to
sleep
what
a
motion
exclaimed
michel
ardan
it
is
forty
hours
since
we
closed
our
eyes
said
nicholl
some
hours
of
sleep
will
restore
our
strength
never
interrupted
michel
well
continued
nicholl
every
one
to
his
taste
i
shall
go
to
sleep
and
stretching
himself
on
the
divan
he
soon
snored
like
a
pounder
that
nicholl
has
a
good
deal
of
sense
said
barbicane
presently
i
shall
follow
his
example
some
moments
after
his
continued
bass
supported
the
captain
baritone
certainly
said
michel
ardan
finding
himself
alone
these
practical
people
have
sometimes
most
opportune
ideas
and
with
his
long
legs
stretched
out
and
his
great
arms
folded
under
his
head
michel
slept
in
his
turn
but
this
sleep
could
be
neither
peaceful
nor
lasting
the
minds
of
these
three
men
were
too
much
occupied
and
some
hours
after
about
seven
in
the
morning
all
three
were
on
foot
at
the
same
instant
the
projectile
was
still
leaving
the
moon
and
turning
its
conical
part
more
and
more
toward
her
an
explicable
phenomenon
but
one
which
happily
served
barbicane
ends
seventeen
hours
more
and
the
moment
for
action
would
have
arrived
the
day
seemed
long
however
bold
the
travelers
might
be
they
were
greatly
impressed
by
the
approach
of
that
moment
which
would
decide
all
either
precipitate
their
fall
on
to
the
moon
or
forever
chain
them
in
an
immutable
orbit
they
counted
the
hours
as
they
passed
too
slow
for
their
wish
barbicane
and
nicholl
were
obstinately
plunged
in
their
calculations
michel
going
and
coming
between
the
narrow
walls
and
watching
that
impassive
moon
with
a
longing
eye
at
times
recollections
of
the
earth
crossed
their
minds
they
saw
once
more
their
friends
of
the
gun
club
and
the
dearest
of
all
maston
at
that
moment
the
honorable
secretary
must
be
filling
his
post
on
the
rocky
mountains
if
he
could
see
the
projectile
through
the
glass
of
his
gigantic
telescope
what
would
he
think
after
seeing
it
disappear
behind
the
south
pole
he
would
see
them
reappear
by
the
north
pole
they
must
therefore
be
a
satellite
of
a
satellite
had
maston
given
this
unexpected
news
to
the
world
was
this
the
of
this
great
enterprise
but
the
day
passed
without
incident
the
terrestrial
midnight
arrived
the
of
december
was
beginning
one
hour
more
and
the
point
of
equal
attraction
would
be
reached
what
speed
would
then
animate
the
projectile
they
could
not
estimate
it
but
no
error
could
vitiate
barbicane
calculations
at
one
in
the
morning
this
speed
ought
to
be
and
would
be
besides
another
phenomenon
would
mark
the
on
the
neutral
line
at
that
spot
the
two
attractions
lunar
and
terrestrial
would
be
annulled
objects
would
weigh
no
more
this
singular
fact
which
had
surprised
barbicane
and
his
companions
so
much
in
going
would
be
repeated
on
their
return
under
the
very
same
conditions
at
this
precise
moment
they
must
act
already
the
projectile
conical
top
was
sensibly
turned
toward
the
lunar
disc
presented
in
such
a
way
as
to
utilize
the
whole
of
the
recoil
produced
by
the
pressure
of
the
rocket
apparatus
the
chances
were
in
favor
of
the
travelers
if
its
speed
was
utterly
annulled
on
this
dead
point
a
decided
movement
toward
the
moon
would
suffice
however
slight
to
determine
its
fall
five
minutes
to
one
said
nicholl
all
is
ready
replied
michel
ardan
directing
a
lighted
match
to
the
flame
of
the
gas
wait
said
barbicane
holding
his
chronometer
in
his
hand
at
that
moment
weight
had
no
effect
the
travelers
felt
in
themselves
the
entire
disappearance
of
it
they
were
very
near
the
neutral
point
if
they
did
not
touch
it
one
said
barbicane
michel
ardan
applied
the
lighted
match
to
a
train
in
communication
with
the
rockets
no
detonation
was
heard
in
the
inside
for
there
was
no
air
but
through
the
scuttles
barbicane
saw
a
prolonged
smoke
the
flames
of
which
were
immediately
extinguished
the
projectile
sustained
a
certain
shock
which
was
sensibly
felt
in
the
interior
the
three
friends
looked
and
listened
without
speaking
and
scarcely
breathing
one
might
have
heard
the
beating
of
their
hearts
amid
this
perfect
silence
are
we
falling
asked
michel
ardan
at
length
no
said
nicholl
since
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
is
not
turning
to
the
lunar
disc
at
this
moment
barbicane
quitting
his
scuttle
turned
to
his
two
companions
he
was
frightfully
pale
his
forehead
wrinkled
and
his
lips
contracted
we
are
falling
said
he
ah
cried
michel
ardan
on
to
the
moon
on
to
the
earth
the
devil
exclaimed
michel
ardan
adding
philosophically
well
when
we
came
into
this
projectile
we
were
very
doubtful
as
to
the
ease
with
which
we
should
get
out
of
it
and
now
this
fearful
fall
had
begun
the
speed
retained
had
borne
the
projectile
beyond
the
dead
point
the
explosion
of
the
rockets
could
not
divert
its
course
this
speed
in
going
had
carried
it
over
the
neutral
line
and
in
returning
had
done
the
same
thing
the
laws
of
physics
condemned
it
pass
through
every
point
which
it
had
already
gone
it
was
a
terrible
fall
from
a
height
of
miles
and
no
springs
to
break
it
according
to
the
laws
of
gunnery
the
projectile
must
strike
the
earth
with
a
speed
equal
to
that
with
which
it
left
the
mouth
of
the
columbiad
a
speed
of
yards
in
the
last
second
but
to
give
some
figures
of
comparison
it
has
been
reckoned
that
an
object
thrown
from
the
top
of
the
towers
of
notre
dame
the
height
of
which
is
only
feet
will
arrive
on
the
pavement
at
a
speed
of
miles
per
hour
here
the
projectile
must
strike
the
earth
with
a
speed
of
miles
per
hour
we
are
lost
said
michel
coolly
very
well
if
we
die
answered
barbicane
with
a
sort
of
religious
enthusiasm
the
results
of
our
travels
will
be
magnificently
spread
it
is
his
own
secret
that
god
will
tell
us
in
the
other
life
the
soul
will
want
to
know
nothing
either
of
machines
or
engines
it
will
be
identified
with
eternal
wisdom
in
fact
interrupted
michel
ardan
the
whole
of
the
other
world
may
well
console
us
for
the
loss
of
that
inferior
orb
called
the
moon
barbicane
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
with
a
motion
of
sublime
resignation
saying
at
the
same
time
the
will
of
heaven
be
done
chapter
xx
the
soundings
of
the
susquehanna
well
lieutenant
and
our
soundings
i
think
sir
that
the
operation
is
nearing
its
completion
replied
lieutenant
bronsfield
but
who
would
have
thought
of
finding
such
a
depth
so
near
in
shore
and
only
miles
from
the
american
coast
certainly
bronsfield
there
is
a
great
depression
said
captain
blomsberry
in
this
spot
there
is
a
submarine
valley
worn
by
humboldt
current
which
skirts
the
coast
of
america
as
far
as
the
straits
of
magellan
these
great
depths
continued
the
lieutenant
are
not
favorable
for
laying
telegraphic
cables
a
level
bottom
like
that
supporting
the
american
cable
between
valentia
and
newfoundland
is
much
better
i
agree
with
you
bronsfield
with
your
permission
lieutenant
where
are
we
now
sir
at
this
moment
we
have
fathoms
of
line
out
and
the
ball
which
draws
the
sounding
lead
has
not
yet
touched
the
bottom
for
if
so
it
would
have
come
up
of
itself
brook
apparatus
is
very
ingenious
said
captain
blomsberry
it
gives
us
very
exact
soundings
touch
cried
at
this
moment
one
of
the
men
at
the
forewheel
who
was
superintending
the
operation
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
mounted
the
quarterdeck
what
depth
have
we
asked
the
captain
three
thousand
six
hundred
and
fathoms
replied
the
lieutenant
entering
it
in
his
notebook
well
bronsfield
said
the
captain
i
will
take
down
the
result
now
haul
in
the
sounding
line
it
will
be
the
work
of
some
hours
in
that
time
the
engineer
can
light
the
furnaces
and
we
shall
be
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
you
have
finished
it
is
ten
and
with
your
permission
lieutenant
i
will
turn
in
do
so
sir
do
so
replied
the
lieutenant
obligingly
the
captain
of
the
susquehanna
as
brave
a
man
as
need
be
and
the
humble
servant
of
his
officers
returned
to
his
cabin
took
a
which
earned
for
the
steward
no
end
of
praise
and
turned
in
not
without
having
complimented
his
servant
upon
his
making
beds
and
slept
a
peaceful
sleep
it
was
then
ten
at
night
the
eleventh
day
of
the
month
of
december
was
drawing
to
a
close
in
a
magnificent
night
the
susquehanna
a
corvette
of
of
the
united
states
navy
was
occupied
in
taking
soundings
in
the
pacific
ocean
about
miles
off
the
american
coast
following
that
long
peninsula
which
stretches
down
the
coast
of
mexico
the
wind
had
dropped
by
degrees
there
was
no
disturbance
in
the
air
the
pennant
hung
motionless
from
the
mast
truck
captain
jonathan
blomsberry
of
colonel
blomsberry
one
of
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
the
gun
club
who
had
married
an
aunt
of
the
captain
and
daughter
of
an
honorable
kentucky
merchant
captain
blomsberry
could
not
have
wished
for
finer
weather
in
which
to
bring
to
a
close
his
delicate
operations
of
sounding
his
corvette
had
not
even
felt
the
great
tempest
which
by
sweeping
away
the
groups
of
clouds
on
the
rocky
mountains
had
allowed
them
to
observe
the
course
of
the
famous
projectile
everything
went
well
and
with
all
the
fervor
of
a
presbyterian
he
did
not
forget
to
thank
heaven
for
it
the
series
of
soundings
taken
by
the
susquehanna
had
for
its
aim
the
finding
of
a
favorable
spot
for
the
laying
of
a
submarine
cable
to
connect
the
hawaiian
islands
with
the
coast
of
america
it
was
a
great
undertaking
due
to
the
instigation
of
a
powerful
company
its
managing
director
the
intelligent
cyrus
field
purposed
even
covering
all
the
islands
of
oceanica
with
a
vast
electrical
network
an
immense
enterprise
and
one
worthy
of
american
genius
to
the
corvette
susquehanna
had
been
confided
the
first
operations
of
sounding
it
was
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
she
was
in
exactly
north
latitude
and
west
longitude
on
the
meridian
of
washington
the
moon
then
in
her
last
quarter
was
beginning
to
rise
above
the
horizon
after
the
departure
of
captain
blomsberry
the
lieutenant
and
some
officers
were
standing
together
on
the
poop
on
the
appearance
of
the
moon
their
thoughts
turned
to
that
orb
which
the
eyes
of
a
whole
hemisphere
were
contemplating
the
best
naval
glasses
could
not
have
discovered
the
projectile
wandering
around
its
hemisphere
and
yet
all
were
pointed
toward
that
brilliant
disc
which
millions
of
eyes
were
looking
at
at
the
same
moment
they
have
been
gone
ten
days
said
lieutenant
bronsfield
at
last
what
has
become
of
them
they
have
arrived
lieutenant
exclaimed
a
young
midshipman
and
they
are
doing
what
all
travelers
do
when
they
arrive
in
a
new
country
taking
a
walk
oh
i
am
sure
of
that
if
you
tell
me
so
my
young
friend
said
lieutenant
bronsfield
smiling
but
continued
another
officer
their
arrival
can
not
be
doubted
the
projectile
was
to
reach
the
moon
when
full
on
the
at
midnight
we
are
now
at
the
of
december
which
makes
six
days
and
in
six
times
hours
without
darkness
one
would
have
time
to
settle
comfortably
i
fancy
i
see
my
brave
countrymen
encamped
at
the
bottom
of
some
valley
on
the
borders
of
a
selenite
stream
near
a
projectile
by
its
fall
amid
volcanic
rubbish
captain
nicholl
beginning
his
leveling
operations
president
barbicane
writing
out
his
notes
and
michel
ardan
embalming
the
lunar
solitudes
with
the
perfume
of
his
yes
it
must
be
so
it
is
so
exclaimed
the
young
midshipman
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
by
this
ideal
description
of
his
superior
officer
i
should
like
to
believe
it
replied
the
lieutenant
who
was
quite
unmoved
unfortunately
direct
news
from
the
lunar
world
is
still
wanting
beg
pardon
lieutenant
said
the
midshipman
but
can
not
president
barbicane
write
a
burst
of
laughter
greeted
this
answer
no
letters
continued
the
young
man
quickly
the
postal
administration
has
something
to
see
to
there
might
it
not
be
the
telegraphic
service
that
is
at
fault
asked
one
of
the
officers
ironically
not
necessarily
replied
the
midshipman
not
at
all
confused
but
it
is
very
easy
to
set
up
a
graphic
communication
with
the
earth
and
how
by
means
of
the
telescope
at
long
peak
you
know
it
brings
the
moon
to
within
four
miles
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
that
it
shows
objects
on
its
surface
of
only
nine
feet
in
diameter
very
well
let
our
industrious
friends
construct
a
giant
alphabet
let
them
write
words
three
fathoms
long
and
sentences
three
miles
long
and
then
they
can
send
us
news
of
themselves
the
young
midshipman
who
had
a
certain
amount
of
imagination
was
loudly
applauded
lieutenant
bronsfield
allowing
that
the
idea
was
possible
but
observing
that
if
by
these
means
they
could
receive
news
from
the
lunar
world
they
could
not
send
any
from
the
terrestrial
unless
the
selenites
had
instruments
fit
for
taking
distant
observations
at
their
disposal
evidently
said
one
of
the
officers
but
what
has
become
of
the
travelers
what
they
have
done
what
they
have
seen
that
above
all
must
interest
us
besides
if
the
experiment
has
succeeded
which
i
do
not
doubt
they
will
try
it
again
the
columbiad
is
still
sunk
in
the
soil
of
florida
it
is
now
only
a
question
of
powder
and
shot
and
every
time
the
moon
is
at
her
zenith
a
cargo
of
visitors
may
be
sent
to
her
it
is
clear
replied
lieutenant
bronsfield
that
maston
will
one
day
join
his
friends
if
he
will
have
me
cried
the
midshipman
i
am
ready
oh
volunteers
will
not
be
wanting
answered
bronsfield
and
if
it
were
allowed
half
of
the
earth
inhabitants
would
emigrate
to
the
moon
this
conversation
between
the
officers
of
the
susquehanna
was
kept
up
until
nearly
one
in
the
morning
we
can
not
say
what
blundering
systems
were
broached
what
inconsistent
theories
advanced
by
these
bold
spirits
since
barbicane
attempt
nothing
seemed
impossible
to
the
americans
they
had
already
designed
an
expedition
not
only
of
savants
but
of
a
whole
colony
toward
the
selenite
borders
and
a
complete
army
consisting
of
infantry
artillery
and
cavalry
to
conquer
the
lunar
world
at
one
in
the
morning
the
hauling
in
of
the
was
not
yet
completed
fathoms
were
still
out
which
would
entail
some
hours
work
according
to
the
commander
orders
the
fires
had
been
lighted
and
steam
was
being
got
up
the
susquehanna
could
have
started
that
very
instant
at
that
moment
it
was
seventeen
minutes
past
one
in
the
morning
lieutenant
bronsfield
was
preparing
to
leave
the
watch
and
return
to
his
cabin
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
distant
hissing
noise
his
comrades
and
himself
first
thought
that
this
hissing
was
caused
by
the
letting
off
of
steam
but
lifting
their
heads
they
found
that
the
noise
was
produced
in
the
highest
regions
of
the
air
they
had
not
time
to
question
each
other
before
the
hissing
became
frightfully
intense
and
suddenly
there
appeared
to
their
dazzled
eyes
an
enormous
meteor
ignited
by
the
rapidity
of
its
course
and
its
friction
through
the
atmospheric
strata
this
fiery
mass
grew
larger
to
their
eyes
and
fell
with
the
noise
of
thunder
upon
the
bowsprit
which
it
smashed
close
to
the
stem
and
buried
itself
in
the
waves
with
a
deafening
roar
a
few
feet
nearer
and
the
susquehanna
would
have
foundered
with
all
on
board
at
this
instant
captain
blomsberry
appeared
and
rushing
on
to
the
whither
all
the
officers
had
hurried
exclaimed
with
your
permission
gentlemen
what
has
happened
and
the
midshipman
making
himself
as
it
were
the
echo
of
the
body
cried
commander
it
is
come
back
again
chapter
xxi
maston
recalled
it
is
come
back
again
the
young
midshipman
had
said
and
every
one
had
understood
him
no
one
doubted
but
that
the
meteor
was
the
projectile
of
the
gun
club
as
to
the
travelers
which
it
enclosed
opinions
were
divided
regarding
their
fate
they
are
dead
said
one
they
are
alive
said
another
the
crater
is
deep
and
the
shock
was
deadened
but
they
must
have
wanted
air
continued
a
third
speaker
they
must
have
died
of
suffocation
burned
replied
a
fourth
the
projectile
was
nothing
but
an
incandescent
mass
as
it
crossed
the
atmosphere
what
does
it
matter
they
exclaimed
unanimously
living
or
dead
we
must
pull
them
out
but
captain
blomsberry
had
assembled
his
officers
and
with
their
permission
was
holding
a
council
they
must
decide
upon
something
to
be
done
immediately
the
more
hasty
ones
were
for
fishing
up
the
projectile
a
difficult
operation
though
not
an
impossible
one
but
the
corvette
had
no
proper
machinery
which
must
be
both
fixed
and
powerful
so
it
was
resolved
that
they
should
put
in
at
the
nearest
port
and
give
information
to
the
gun
club
of
the
projectile
fall
this
determination
was
unanimous
the
choice
of
the
port
had
to
be
discussed
the
neighboring
coast
had
no
anchorage
on
latitude
higher
up
above
the
peninsula
of
monterey
stands
the
important
town
from
which
it
takes
its
name
but
seated
on
the
borders
of
a
perfect
desert
it
was
not
connected
with
the
interior
by
a
network
of
telegraphic
wires
and
electricity
alone
could
spread
these
important
news
fast
enough
some
degrees
above
opened
the
bay
of
san
francisco
through
the
capital
of
the
gold
country
communication
would
be
easy
with
the
heart
of
the
union
and
in
less
than
two
days
the
susquehanna
by
putting
on
high
pressure
could
arrive
in
that
port
she
must
therefore
start
at
once
the
fires
were
made
up
they
could
set
off
immediately
two
thousand
fathoms
of
line
were
still
out
which
captain
blomsberry
not
wishing
to
lose
precious
time
in
hauling
in
resolved
to
cut
we
will
fasten
the
end
to
a
buoy
said
he
and
that
buoy
will
show
us
the
exact
spot
where
the
projectile
fell
besides
replied
lieutenant
bronsfield
we
have
our
situation
exact
north
latitude
and
west
longitude
well
bronsfield
replied
the
captain
now
with
your
permission
we
will
have
the
line
cut
a
strong
buoy
strengthened
by
a
couple
of
spars
was
thrown
into
the
ocean
the
end
of
the
rope
was
carefully
lashed
to
it
and
left
solely
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
billows
the
buoy
would
not
sensibly
deviate
from
the
spot
at
this
moment
the
engineer
sent
to
inform
the
captain
that
steam
was
up
and
they
could
start
for
which
agreeable
communication
the
captain
thanked
him
the
course
was
then
given
and
the
corvette
wearing
steered
at
full
steam
direct
for
san
francisco
it
was
three
in
the
morning
four
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
cross
it
was
nothing
for
a
good
vessel
like
the
susquehanna
in
hours
she
had
covered
that
distance
and
on
the
of
december
at
minutes
past
one
at
night
she
entered
the
bay
of
san
francisco
at
the
sight
of
a
ship
of
the
national
navy
arriving
at
full
speed
with
her
bowsprit
broken
public
curiosity
was
greatly
roused
a
dense
crowd
soon
assembled
on
the
quay
waiting
for
them
to
disembark
after
casting
anchor
captain
blomsberry
and
lieutenant
bronsfield
entered
an
cutter
which
soon
brought
them
to
land
they
jumped
on
to
the
quay
the
telegraph
they
asked
without
answering
one
of
the
thousand
questions
addressed
to
them
the
officer
of
the
port
conducted
them
to
the
telegraph
office
through
a
concourse
of
spectators
blomsberry
and
bronsfield
entered
while
the
crowd
crushed
each
other
at
the
door
some
minutes
later
a
fourfold
telegram
was
sent
out
the
first
to
the
naval
secretary
at
washington
the
second
to
the
of
the
gun
club
baltimore
the
third
to
the
hon
maston
long
peak
rocky
mountains
and
the
fourth
to
the
of
the
cambridge
observatory
massachusetts
it
was
worded
as
follows
in
north
latitude
and
west
longitude
on
the
of
december
at
seventeen
minutes
past
one
in
the
morning
the
projectile
of
the
columbiad
fell
into
the
pacific
send
blomsberry
commander
susquehanna
five
minutes
afterward
the
whole
town
of
san
francisco
learned
the
news
before
six
in
the
evening
the
different
states
of
the
union
had
heard
the
great
catastrophe
and
after
midnight
by
the
cable
the
whole
of
europe
knew
the
result
of
the
great
american
experiment
we
will
not
attempt
to
picture
the
effect
produced
on
the
entire
world
by
that
unexpected
denouement
on
receipt
of
the
telegram
the
naval
secretary
telegraphed
to
the
susquehanna
to
wait
in
the
bay
of
san
francisco
without
extinguishing
her
fires
day
and
night
she
must
be
ready
to
put
to
sea
the
cambridge
observatory
called
a
special
meeting
and
with
that
composure
which
distinguishes
learned
bodies
in
general
peacefully
discussed
the
scientific
bearings
of
the
question
at
the
gun
club
there
was
an
explosion
all
the
gunners
were
assembled
the
hon
wilcome
was
in
the
act
of
reading
the
premature
dispatch
in
which
maston
and
belfast
announced
that
the
projectile
had
just
been
seen
in
the
gigantic
reflector
of
long
peak
and
also
that
it
was
held
by
lunar
attraction
and
was
playing
the
part
of
under
satellite
to
the
lunar
world
we
know
the
truth
on
that
point
but
on
the
arrival
of
blomsberry
dispatch
so
decidely
contradicting
maston
telegram
two
parties
were
formed
in
the
bosom
of
the
gun
club
on
one
side
were
those
who
admitted
the
fall
of
the
projectile
and
consequently
the
return
of
the
travelers
on
the
other
those
who
believed
in
the
observations
of
long
peak
concluded
that
the
commander
of
the
susquehanna
had
made
a
mistake
to
the
latter
the
pretended
projectile
was
nothing
but
a
meteor
nothing
but
a
meteor
a
shooting
globe
which
in
its
fall
had
smashed
the
bows
of
the
corvette
it
was
difficult
to
answer
this
argument
for
the
speed
with
which
it
was
animated
must
have
made
observation
very
difficult
the
commander
of
the
susquehanna
and
her
officers
might
have
made
a
mistake
in
all
good
faith
one
argument
however
was
in
their
favor
namely
that
if
the
projectile
had
fallen
on
the
earth
its
place
of
meeting
with
the
terrestrial
globe
could
only
take
place
on
this
north
latitude
and
taking
into
consideration
the
time
that
had
elapsed
and
the
rotary
motion
of
the
earth
between
the
and
the
of
west
longitude
in
any
case
it
was
decided
in
the
gun
club
that
blomsberry
brothers
bilsby
and
major
elphinstone
should
go
straight
to
san
francisco
and
consult
as
to
the
means
of
raising
the
projectile
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
these
devoted
men
set
off
at
once
and
the
railroad
which
will
soon
cross
the
whole
of
central
america
took
them
as
far
as
louis
where
the
swift
awaited
them
almost
at
the
same
moment
in
which
the
secretary
of
marine
the
of
the
gun
club
and
the
of
the
observatory
received
the
dispatch
from
san
francisco
the
honorable
maston
was
undergoing
the
greatest
excitement
he
had
ever
experienced
in
his
life
an
excitement
which
even
the
bursting
of
his
pet
gun
which
had
more
than
once
nearly
cost
him
his
life
had
not
caused
him
we
may
remember
that
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
had
started
soon
after
the
projectile
and
almost
as
quickly
for
the
station
on
long
peak
in
the
rocky
mountains
belfast
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
accompanying
him
arrived
there
the
two
friends
had
installed
themselves
at
once
never
quitting
the
summit
of
their
enormous
telescope
we
know
that
this
gigantic
instrument
had
been
set
up
according
to
the
reflecting
system
called
by
the
english
front
view
this
arrangement
subjected
all
objects
to
but
one
reflection
making
the
view
consequently
much
clearer
the
result
was
that
when
they
were
taking
observation
maston
and
belfast
were
placed
in
the
part
of
the
instrument
and
not
in
the
lower
which
they
reached
by
a
circular
staircase
a
masterpiece
of
lightness
while
below
them
opened
a
metal
well
terminated
by
the
metallic
mirror
which
measured
two
hundred
and
eighty
feet
in
depth
it
was
on
a
narrow
platform
placed
above
the
telescope
that
the
two
savants
passed
their
existence
execrating
the
day
which
hid
the
moon
from
their
eyes
and
the
clouds
which
obstinately
veiled
her
during
the
night
what
then
was
their
delight
when
after
some
days
of
waiting
on
the
night
of
the
of
december
they
saw
the
vehicle
which
was
bearing
their
friends
into
space
to
this
delight
succeeded
a
great
deception
when
trusting
to
a
cursory
observation
they
launched
their
first
telegram
to
the
world
erroneously
affirming
that
the
projectile
had
become
a
satellite
of
the
moon
gravitating
in
an
immutable
orbit
from
that
moment
it
had
never
shown
itself
to
their
eyes
a
disappearance
all
the
more
easily
explained
as
it
was
then
passing
behind
the
moon
invisible
disc
but
when
it
was
time
for
it
to
reappear
on
the
visible
disc
one
may
imagine
the
impatience
of
the
fuming
maston
and
his
not
less
impatient
companion
each
minute
of
the
night
they
thought
they
saw
the
projectile
once
more
and
they
did
not
see
it
hence
constant
discussions
and
violent
disputes
between
them
belfast
affirming
that
the
projectile
could
not
be
seen
maston
maintaining
that
it
had
put
his
eyes
out
it
is
the
projectile
repeated
maston
no
answered
belfast
it
is
an
avalanche
detached
from
a
lunar
mountain
well
we
shall
see
it
no
we
shall
not
see
it
any
more
it
is
carried
into
space
yes
no
and
at
these
moments
when
contradictions
rained
like
hail
the
irritability
of
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
constituted
a
permanent
danger
for
the
honorable
belfast
the
existence
of
these
two
together
would
soon
have
become
impossible
but
an
unforseen
event
cut
short
their
everlasting
discussions
during
the
night
from
the
to
the
of
december
the
two
irreconcilable
friends
were
busy
observing
the
lunar
disc
maston
abusing
the
learned
belfast
as
usual
who
was
by
his
side
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
maintaining
for
the
thousandth
time
that
he
had
just
seen
the
projectile
and
adding
that
he
could
see
michel
ardan
face
looking
through
one
of
the
scuttles
at
the
same
time
enforcing
his
argument
by
a
series
of
gestures
which
his
formidable
hook
rendered
very
unpleasant
at
this
moment
belfast
servant
appeared
on
the
platform
it
was
ten
at
night
and
gave
him
a
dispatch
it
was
the
commander
of
the
susquehanna
telegram
belfast
tore
the
envelope
and
read
and
uttered
a
cry
what
said
maston
the
projectile
well
has
fallen
to
the
earth
another
cry
this
time
a
perfect
howl
answered
him
he
turned
toward
maston
the
unfortunate
man
imprudently
leaning
over
the
metal
tube
had
disappeared
in
the
immense
telescope
a
fall
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
feet
belfast
dismayed
rushed
to
the
orifice
of
the
reflector
he
breathed
maston
caught
by
his
metal
hook
was
holding
on
by
one
of
the
rings
which
bound
the
telescope
together
uttering
fearful
cries
belfast
called
help
was
brought
tackle
was
let
down
and
they
hoisted
up
not
without
some
trouble
the
imprudent
secretary
of
the
gun
club
he
reappeared
at
the
upper
orifice
without
hurt
ah
said
he
if
i
had
broken
the
mirror
you
would
have
paid
for
it
replied
belfast
severely
and
that
cursed
projectile
has
fallen
asked
maston
into
the
pacific
let
us
go
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
two
savants
were
descending
the
declivity
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
two
days
after
at
the
same
time
as
their
friends
of
the
gun
club
they
arrived
at
san
francisco
having
killed
five
horses
on
the
road
elphinstone
the
brothers
blomsberry
and
bilsby
rushed
toward
them
on
their
arrival
what
shall
we
do
they
exclaimed
fish
up
the
projectile
replied
maston
and
the
sooner
the
better
chapter
xxii
recovered
from
the
sea
the
spot
where
the
projectile
sank
under
the
waves
was
exactly
known
but
the
machinery
to
grasp
it
and
bring
it
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
was
still
wanting
it
must
first
be
invented
then
made
american
engineers
could
not
be
troubled
with
such
trifles
the
once
fixed
by
their
help
they
were
sure
to
raise
it
in
spite
of
its
weight
which
was
lessened
by
the
density
of
the
liquid
in
which
it
was
plunged
but
the
projectile
was
not
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
they
must
act
promptly
in
the
interest
of
the
travelers
no
one
doubted
that
they
were
still
living
yes
repeated
maston
incessantly
whose
confidence
gained
over
everybody
our
friends
are
clever
people
and
they
can
not
have
fallen
like
simpletons
they
are
alive
quite
alive
but
we
must
make
haste
if
we
wish
to
find
them
so
food
and
water
do
not
trouble
me
they
have
enough
for
a
long
while
but
air
air
that
is
what
they
will
soon
want
so
quick
quick
and
they
did
go
quick
they
fitted
up
the
susquehanna
for
her
new
destination
her
powerful
machinery
was
brought
to
bear
upon
the
the
aluminum
projectile
only
weighed
pounds
a
weight
very
inferior
to
that
of
the
transatlantic
cable
which
had
been
drawn
up
under
similar
conditions
the
only
difficulty
was
in
fishing
up
a
projectile
the
walls
of
which
were
so
smooth
as
to
offer
no
hold
for
the
hooks
on
that
account
engineer
murchison
hastened
to
san
francisco
and
had
some
enormous
fixed
on
an
automatic
system
which
would
never
let
the
projectile
go
if
it
once
succeeded
in
seizing
it
in
its
powerful
claws
were
also
prepared
which
through
this
impervious
covering
allowed
the
divers
to
observe
the
bottom
of
the
sea
he
also
had
put
on
board
an
apparatus
of
compressed
air
very
cleverly
designed
there
were
perfect
chambers
pierced
with
scuttles
which
with
water
let
into
certain
compartments
could
draw
it
down
into
great
depths
these
apparatuses
were
at
san
francisco
where
they
had
been
used
in
the
construction
of
a
submarine
breakwater
and
very
fortunately
it
was
so
for
there
was
no
time
to
construct
any
but
in
spite
of
the
perfection
of
the
machinery
in
spite
of
the
ingenuity
of
the
savants
entrusted
with
the
use
of
them
the
success
of
the
operation
was
far
from
being
certain
how
great
were
the
chances
against
them
the
projectile
being
feet
under
the
water
and
if
even
it
was
brought
to
the
surface
how
would
the
travelers
have
borne
the
terrible
shock
which
feet
of
water
had
perhaps
not
sufficiently
broken
at
any
rate
they
must
act
quickly
maston
hurried
the
workmen
day
and
night
he
was
ready
to
don
the
himself
or
try
the
air
apparatus
in
order
to
reconnoiter
the
situation
of
his
courageous
friends
but
in
spite
of
all
the
diligence
displayed
in
preparing
the
different
engines
in
spite
of
the
considerable
sum
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
gun
club
by
the
government
of
the
union
five
long
days
five
centuries
elapsed
before
the
preparations
were
complete
during
this
time
public
opinion
was
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
telegrams
were
exchanged
incessantly
throughout
the
entire
world
by
means
of
wires
and
electric
cables
the
saving
of
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
was
an
international
affair
every
one
who
had
subscribed
to
the
gun
club
was
directly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
travelers
at
length
the
the
and
the
automatic
were
put
on
board
maston
engineer
murchison
and
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
were
already
in
their
cabins
they
had
but
to
start
which
they
did
on
the
of
december
at
eight
at
night
the
corvette
meeting
with
a
beautiful
sea
a
northeasterly
wind
and
rather
sharp
cold
the
whole
population
of
san
francisco
was
gathered
on
the
quay
greatly
excited
but
silent
reserving
their
hurrahs
for
the
return
steam
was
fully
up
and
the
screw
of
the
susquehanna
carried
them
briskly
out
of
the
bay
it
is
needless
to
relate
the
conversations
on
board
between
the
officers
sailors
and
passengers
all
these
men
had
but
one
thought
all
these
hearts
beat
under
the
same
emotion
while
they
were
hastening
to
help
them
what
were
barbicane
and
his
companions
doing
what
had
become
of
them
were
they
able
to
attempt
any
bold
maneuver
to
regain
their
liberty
none
could
say
the
truth
is
that
every
attempt
must
have
failed
immersed
nearly
four
miles
under
the
ocean
this
metal
prison
defied
every
effort
of
its
prisoners
on
the
at
eight
in
the
morning
after
a
rapid
passage
the
susquehanna
was
due
at
the
fatal
spot
they
must
wait
till
twelve
to
take
the
reckoning
exactly
the
buoy
to
which
the
sounding
line
had
been
lashed
had
not
yet
been
recognized
at
twelve
captain
blomsberry
assisted
by
his
officers
who
superintended
the
observations
took
the
reckoning
in
the
presence
of
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
then
there
was
a
moment
of
anxiety
her
position
decided
the
susquehanna
was
found
to
be
some
minutes
westward
of
the
spot
where
the
projectile
had
disappeared
beneath
the
waves
the
ship
course
was
then
changed
so
as
to
reach
this
exact
point
at
minutes
past
twelve
they
reached
the
buoy
it
was
in
perfect
condition
and
must
have
shifted
but
little
at
last
exclaimed
maston
shall
we
begin
asked
captain
blomsberry
without
losing
a
second
every
precaution
was
taken
to
keep
the
corvette
almost
completely
motionless
before
trying
to
seize
the
projectile
engineer
murchison
wanted
to
find
its
exact
position
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
submarine
apparatus
destined
for
this
expedition
was
supplied
with
air
the
working
of
these
engines
was
not
without
danger
for
at
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
water
and
under
such
great
pressure
they
were
exposed
to
fracture
the
consequences
of
which
would
be
dreadful
maston
the
brothers
blomsberry
and
engineer
murchison
without
heeding
these
dangers
took
their
places
in
the
the
commander
posted
on
his
bridge
superintended
the
operation
ready
to
stop
or
haul
in
the
chains
on
the
slightest
signal
the
screw
had
been
shipped
and
the
whole
power
of
the
machinery
collected
on
the
capstan
would
have
quickly
drawn
the
apparatus
on
board
the
descent
began
at
minutes
past
one
at
night
and
the
chamber
drawn
under
by
the
reservoirs
full
of
water
disappeared
from
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
emotion
of
the
officers
and
sailors
on
board
was
now
divided
between
the
prisoners
in
the
projectile
and
the
prisoners
in
the
submarine
apparatus
as
to
the
latter
they
forgot
themselves
and
glued
to
the
windows
of
the
scuttles
attentively
watched
the
liquid
mass
through
which
they
were
passing
the
descent
was
rapid
at
seventeen
minutes
past
two
maston
and
his
companions
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
pacific
but
they
saw
nothing
but
an
arid
desert
no
longer
animated
by
either
fauna
or
flora
by
the
light
of
their
lamps
furnished
with
powerful
reflectors
they
could
see
the
dark
beds
of
the
ocean
for
a
considerable
extent
of
view
but
the
projectile
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
impatience
of
these
bold
divers
can
not
be
described
and
having
an
electrical
communication
with
the
corvette
they
made
a
signal
already
agreed
upon
and
for
the
space
of
a
mile
the
susquehanna
moved
their
chamber
along
some
yards
above
the
bottom
thus
they
explored
the
whole
submarine
plain
deceived
at
every
turn
by
optical
illusions
which
almost
broke
their
hearts
here
a
rock
there
a
projection
from
the
ground
seemed
to
be
the
projectile
but
their
mistake
was
soon
discovered
and
then
they
were
in
despair
but
where
are
they
where
are
they
cried
maston
and
the
poor
man
called
loudly
upon
nicholl
barbicane
and
michel
ardan
as
if
his
unfortunate
friends
could
either
hear
or
answer
him
through
such
an
impenetrable
medium
the
search
continued
under
these
conditions
until
the
vitiated
air
compelled
the
divers
to
ascend
the
hauling
in
began
about
six
in
the
evening
and
was
not
ended
before
midnight
said
maston
as
he
set
foot
on
the
bridge
of
the
corvette
yes
answered
captain
blomsberry
and
on
another
spot
yes
maston
did
not
doubt
of
their
final
success
but
his
companions
no
longer
upheld
by
the
excitement
of
the
first
hours
understood
all
the
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
what
seemed
easy
at
san
francisco
seemed
here
in
the
wide
ocean
almost
impossible
the
chances
of
success
diminished
in
rapid
proportion
and
it
was
from
chance
alone
that
the
meeting
with
the
projectile
might
be
expected
the
next
day
the
in
spite
of
the
fatigue
of
the
previous
day
the
operation
was
renewed
the
corvette
advanced
some
minutes
to
westward
and
the
apparatus
provided
with
air
bore
the
same
explorers
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
the
whole
day
passed
in
fruitless
research
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
a
desert
the
brought
no
other
result
nor
the
it
was
disheartening
they
thought
of
those
unfortunates
shut
up
in
the
projectile
for
days
perhaps
at
that
moment
they
were
experiencing
the
first
approach
of
suffocation
that
is
if
they
had
escaped
the
dangers
of
their
fall
the
air
was
spent
and
doubtless
with
the
air
all
their
the
air
possibly
answered
maston
resolutely
but
their
never
on
the
after
two
more
days
of
search
all
hope
was
gone
this
projectile
was
but
an
atom
in
the
immensity
of
the
ocean
they
must
give
up
all
idea
of
finding
it
but
maston
would
not
hear
of
going
away
he
would
not
abandon
the
place
without
at
least
discovering
the
tomb
of
his
friends
but
commander
blomsberry
could
no
longer
persist
and
in
spite
of
the
exclamations
of
the
worthy
secretary
was
obliged
to
give
the
order
to
sail
on
the
of
december
at
nine
the
susquehanna
heading
northeast
resumed
her
course
to
the
bay
of
san
francisco
it
was
ten
in
the
morning
the
corvette
was
under
as
it
was
regretting
to
leave
the
spot
where
the
catastrophe
had
taken
place
when
a
sailor
perched
on
the
crosstrees
watching
the
sea
cried
suddenly
a
buoy
on
the
lee
bow
the
officers
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
and
by
the
help
of
their
glasses
saw
that
the
object
signalled
had
the
appearance
of
one
of
those
buoys
which
are
used
to
mark
the
passages
of
bays
or
rivers
but
singularly
to
say
a
flag
floating
on
the
wind
surmounted
its
cone
which
emerged
five
or
six
feet
out
of
water
this
buoy
shone
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
plates
of
silver
commander
blomsberry
maston
and
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
were
mounted
on
the
bridge
examining
this
object
straying
at
random
on
the
waves
all
looked
with
feverish
anxiety
but
in
silence
none
dared
give
expression
to
the
thoughts
which
came
to
the
minds
of
all
the
corvette
approached
to
within
two
cables
lengths
of
the
object
a
shudder
ran
through
the
whole
crew
that
flag
was
the
american
flag
at
this
moment
a
perfect
howling
was
heard
it
was
the
brave
maston
who
had
just
fallen
all
in
a
heap
forgetting
on
the
one
hand
that
his
right
arm
had
been
replaced
by
an
iron
hook
and
on
the
other
that
a
simple
cap
covered
his
he
had
given
himself
a
formidable
blow
they
hurried
toward
him
picked
him
up
restored
him
to
life
and
what
were
his
first
words
ah
trebly
brutes
quadruply
idiots
quintuply
boobies
that
we
are
what
is
it
exclaimed
everyone
around
him
what
is
it
come
speak
it
is
simpletons
howled
the
terrible
secretary
it
is
that
the
projectile
only
weighs
pounds
well
and
that
it
displaces
tons
or
in
other
words
pounds
and
that
consequently
ah
what
stress
the
worthy
man
had
laid
on
the
verb
float
and
it
was
true
all
yes
all
these
savants
had
forgotten
this
fundamental
law
namely
that
on
account
of
its
specific
lightness
the
projectile
after
having
been
drawn
by
its
fall
to
the
greatest
depths
of
the
ocean
must
naturally
return
to
the
surface
and
now
it
was
floating
quietly
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
the
boats
were
put
to
sea
maston
and
his
friends
had
rushed
into
them
excitement
was
at
its
height
every
heart
beat
loudly
while
they
advanced
to
the
projectile
what
did
it
contain
living
or
dead
living
yes
living
at
least
unless
death
had
struck
barbicane
and
his
two
friends
since
they
had
hoisted
the
flag
profound
silence
reigned
on
the
boats
all
were
breathless
eyes
no
longer
saw
one
of
the
scuttles
of
the
projectile
was
open
some
pieces
of
glass
remained
in
the
frame
showing
that
it
had
been
broken
this
scuttle
was
actually
five
feet
above
the
water
a
boat
came
alongside
that
of
maston
and
maston
rushed
to
the
broken
window
at
that
moment
they
heard
a
clear
and
merry
voice
the
voice
of
michel
ardan
exclaiming
in
an
accent
of
triumph
white
all
barbicane
white
all
barbicane
michel
ardan
and
nicholl
were
playing
at
dominoes
chapter
xxiii
the
end
we
may
remember
the
intense
sympathy
which
had
accompanied
the
travelers
on
their
departure
if
at
the
beginning
of
the
enterprise
they
had
excited
such
emotion
both
in
the
old
and
new
world
with
what
enthusiasm
would
they
be
received
on
their
return
the
millions
of
spectators
which
had
beset
the
peninsula
of
florida
would
they
not
rush
to
meet
these
sublime
adventurers
those
legions
of
strangers
hurrying
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
toward
the
american
shores
would
they
leave
the
union
without
having
seen
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
no
and
the
ardent
passion
of
the
public
was
bound
to
respond
worthily
to
the
greatness
of
the
enterprise
human
creatures
who
had
left
the
terrestrial
sphere
and
returned
after
this
strange
voyage
into
celestial
space
could
not
fail
to
be
received
as
the
prophet
elias
would
be
if
he
came
back
to
earth
to
see
them
first
and
then
to
hear
them
such
was
the
universal
longing
barbicane
michel
ardan
nicholl
and
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
returning
without
delay
to
baltimore
were
received
with
indescribable
enthusiasm
the
notes
of
president
voyage
were
ready
to
be
given
to
the
public
the
new
york
bought
the
manuscript
at
a
price
not
yet
known
but
which
must
have
been
very
high
indeed
during
the
publication
of
a
journey
to
the
moon
the
sale
of
this
paper
amounted
to
five
millions
of
copies
three
days
after
the
return
of
the
travelers
to
the
earth
the
slightest
detail
of
their
expedition
was
known
there
remained
nothing
more
but
to
see
the
heroes
of
this
superhuman
enterprise
the
expedition
of
barbicane
and
his
friends
round
the
moon
had
enabled
them
to
correct
the
many
admitted
theories
regarding
the
terrestrial
satellite
these
savants
had
observed
and
under
particular
circumstances
they
knew
what
systems
should
be
rejected
what
retained
with
regard
to
the
formation
of
that
orb
its
origin
its
habitability
its
past
present
and
future
had
even
given
up
their
last
secrets
who
could
advance
objections
against
conscientious
observers
who
at
less
than
miles
distance
had
marked
that
curious
mountain
of
tycho
the
strangest
system
of
lunar
orography
how
answer
those
savants
whose
sight
had
penetrated
the
abyss
of
pluto
circle
how
contradict
those
bold
ones
whom
the
chances
of
their
enterprise
had
borne
over
that
invisible
face
of
the
disc
which
no
human
eye
until
then
had
ever
seen
it
was
now
their
turn
to
impose
some
limit
on
that
selenographic
science
which
had
reconstructed
the
lunar
world
as
cuvier
did
the
skeleton
of
a
fossil
and
say
the
moon
this
a
habitable
world
inhabited
before
the
earth
the
moon
that
a
world
uninhabitable
and
now
uninhabited
to
celebrate
the
return
of
its
most
illustrious
member
and
his
two
companions
the
gun
club
decided
upon
giving
a
banquet
but
a
banquet
worthy
of
the
conquerors
worthy
of
the
american
people
and
under
such
conditions
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
union
could
directly
take
part
in
it
all
the
head
lines
of
railroads
in
the
states
were
joined
by
flying
rails
and
on
all
the
platforms
lined
with
the
same
flags
and
decorated
with
the
same
ornaments
were
tables
laid
and
all
served
alike
at
certain
hours
successively
calculated
marked
by
electric
clocks
which
beat
the
seconds
at
the
same
time
the
population
were
invited
to
take
their
places
at
the
banquet
tables
for
four
days
from
the
to
the
of
january
the
trains
were
stopped
as
they
are
on
sundays
on
the
railways
of
the
united
states
and
every
road
was
open
one
engine
only
at
full
speed
drawing
a
triumphal
carriage
had
the
right
of
traveling
for
those
four
days
on
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
the
engine
was
manned
by
a
driver
and
a
stoker
and
bore
by
special
favor
the
hon
maston
secretary
of
the
gun
club
the
carriage
was
reserved
for
president
barbicane
colonel
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
at
the
whistle
of
the
driver
amid
the
hurrahs
and
all
the
admiring
vociferations
of
the
american
language
the
train
left
the
platform
of
baltimore
it
traveled
at
a
speed
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
miles
in
the
hour
but
what
was
this
speed
compared
with
that
which
had
carried
the
three
heroes
from
the
mouth
of
the
columbiad
thus
they
sped
from
one
town
to
the
other
finding
whole
populations
at
table
on
their
road
saluting
them
with
the
same
acclamations
lavishing
the
same
bravos
they
traveled
in
this
way
through
the
east
of
the
union
pennsylvania
connecticut
massachusetts
vermont
maine
and
new
hampshire
the
north
and
west
by
new
york
ohio
michigan
and
wisconsin
returning
to
the
south
by
illinois
missouri
arkansas
texas
and
louisiana
they
went
to
the
southeast
by
alabama
and
florida
going
up
by
georgia
and
the
carolinas
visiting
the
center
by
tennessee
kentucky
virginia
and
indiana
and
after
quitting
the
washington
station
baltimore
where
for
four
days
one
would
have
thought
that
the
united
states
of
america
were
seated
at
one
immense
banquet
saluting
them
simultaneously
with
the
same
hurrahs
the
apotheosis
was
worthy
of
these
three
heroes
whom
fable
would
have
placed
in
the
rank
of
demigods
and
now
will
this
attempt
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
travels
lead
to
any
practical
result
will
direct
communication
with
the
moon
ever
be
established
will
they
ever
lay
the
foundation
of
a
traveling
service
through
the
solar
world
will
they
go
from
one
planet
to
another
from
jupiter
to
mercury
and
after
awhile
from
one
star
to
another
from
the
polar
to
sirius
will
this
means
of
locomotion
allow
us
to
visit
those
suns
which
swarm
in
the
firmament
to
such
questions
no
answer
can
be
given
but
knowing
the
bold
ingenuity
of
the
race
no
one
would
be
astonished
if
the
americans
seek
to
make
some
use
of
president
barbicane
attempt
thus
some
time
after
the
return
of
the
travelers
the
public
received
with
marked
favor
the
announcement
of
a
company
limited
with
a
capital
of
a
hundred
million
of
dollars
divided
into
a
hundred
thousand
shares
of
a
thousand
dollars
each
under
the
name
of
the
national
company
of
interstellary
communication
president
barbicane
captain
nicholl
secretary
maston
director
of
movements
michel
ardan
and
as
it
is
part
of
the
american
temperament
to
foresee
everything
in
business
even
failure
the
honorable
harry
trolloppe
judge
commissioner
and
francis
drayton
magistrate
were
nominated
beforehand
notes
jules
verne
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
and
a
trip
around
it
i
originally
intended
to
correct
some
of
the
numbers
in
the
book
for
example
page
has
thirteenth
where
thirtieth
would
be
more
appropriate
some
of
the
densities
and
volumes
and
masses
match
up
the
business
with
the
wrong
exhaust
velocity
of
the
gun
is
also
a
bit
confusing
the
dates
and
times
are
quite
consistent
throughout
although
they
are
close
enough
that
verne
must
have
been
working
from
a
for
example
i
think
he
has
the
time
for
the
fall
back
to
earth
exactly
matching
the
time
for
the
trip
out
there
are
also
inconsistent
spellings
for
example
aluminum
and
aluminium
some
of
these
annoyed
me
in
the
sense
of
disturbing
my
reading
since
the
reader
is
reading
for
pleasure
the
annoyance
should
be
removed
all
cases
of
the
british
spelling
of
aluminium
have
been
changed
to
the
american
spelling
aluminum
i
decided
that
the
correction
project
was
going
to
be
a
lot
of
trouble
and
might
be
a
perversion
of
the
original
work
i
concentrated
instead
on
producing
an
accurate
rendition
of
the
text
however
if
a
french
speaker
can
find
a
french
edition
it
might
be
nice
to
see
if
the
translators
introduced
errors
the
measurements
seem
to
have
been
converted
from
metric
without
regard
for
significant
figures
occasional
conversions
are
simply
omitted
with
feet
inserted
for
meters
without
fixing
the
numbers
these
might
be
safely
recomputed
without
doing
violence
to
the
spirit
of
the
original
work
whether
one
should
standardize
the
spelling
of
aluminium
i
do
know
aluminium
has
a
certain
charm
i
do
know
what
american
or
english
usage
was
at
the
time
we
might
consider
converting
all
the
temperatures
to
fahrenheit
i
suggest
removing
the
page
numbers
undoing
all
the
hyphenation
and
repackaging
the
lines
at
a
length
of
up
to
characters
with
only
occasional
word
breaks
page
s
and
a
full
reformating
has
been
done
line
have
been
painstakingly
removed
hypenated
words
at
the
end
of
lines
have
been
eliminated
to
the
best
of
my
judgement
i
think
a
table
of
units
should
be
offered
for
the
reader
myriameter
km
fathom
feet
league
miles
but
do
know
french
usage
in
page
has
perigee
leagues
french
or
miles
mean
would
be
nice
to
know
the
currency
conversions
of
the
day
we
may
criticize
verne
for
his
errors
but
the
remarkable
thing
is
how
much
he
got
right
i
think
this
was
the
first
engineering
proposal
for
space
travel
using
physics
instead
of
magic
verne
deserves
much
of
the
credit
for
inspiring
the
early
rocket
pioneers
and
ultimately
today
space
program
as
literary
history
i
note
that
the
man
who
sold
the

borrows
from
it
add

sic
a

i
have
changed
the
one
case
of

to
the
correct
perihelion
there
an
incorrect
reference
to
in
the
early
part
of

to
fix
i
read
it
over
and
left
it
there
close
enough
for

i
am
sure
they
would
have
missed
the

by
a
lot
dates
were
not
fixed
inconsistent
spelling
