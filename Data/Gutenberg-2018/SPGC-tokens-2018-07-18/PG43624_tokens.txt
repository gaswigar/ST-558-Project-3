i
the
coming
of
annabel
lee
but
the
only
person
in
boston
town
who
has
given
me
of
the
treasure
of
her
heart
and
the
treasure
of
her
mind
and
the
touch
of
her
fair
hand
in
friendship
is
annabel
lee
since
i
looked
for
no
friendship
whatsoever
in
boston
town
this
friendship
comes
to
me
with
the
gentleness
of
sunshowers
mingled
with
and
there
is
a
human
quality
in
the
air
that
rises
from
the
bitter
salt
sea
years
ago
there
was
one
who
wrote
a
poem
about
annabel
lee
a
different
lady
from
this
lady
it
may
be
or
perhaps
it
is
the
same
and
so
now
this
poem
and
this
lady
are
never
far
from
me
if
indeed
poe
did
not
mean
this
annabel
lee
when
he
wrote
so
enchanting
a
i
at
any
rate
shall
always
mean
this
annabel
lee
when
poe
s
enchanting
runs
in
my
mind
forsooth
poe
s
annabel
lee
was
not
so
enchanting
as
this
annabel
lee
i
think
this
as
i
gaze
up
at
her
graceful
little
figure
standing
on
my
shelf
her
wonderful
expressive
little
face
her
strange
white
hands
her
hair
bound
and
twisted
into
glittering
black
ropes
and
wound
tightly
around
her
head
were
you
to
see
her
you
would
say
that
annabel
lee
is
only
a
very
pretty
little
black
and
and
white
statue
of
a
japanese
woman
and
forthwith
you
would
be
greatly
mistaken
it
is
true
that
she
had
stood
in
extremely
dusty
durance
vile
in
a
japanese
shop
in
boylston
street
for
months
before
i
found
her
it
is
also
true
that
i
fell
instantly
in
love
with
her
and
that
on
payment
of
a
few
strange
dollars
to
the
i
rescued
her
from
her
surroundings
and
bore
her
out
to
where
i
live
by
the
sea
the
sea
where
these
wonderful
wide
green
waves
are
rolling
rolling
rolling
always
annabel
lee
hears
these
waves
and
i
hear
them
at
times
holding
our
breath
and
listening
until
our
eyes
are
strained
with
listening
and
with
some
haunting
terror
and
the
low
rushing
goes
to
our
two
pale
souls
for
though
my
friend
annabel
lee
lived
dumbly
and
dustily
for
months
in
the
shop
in
boylston
street
as
if
she
were
indeed
but
a
porcelain
statue
and
though
she
was
purchased
with
a
price
still
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
exquisitely
human
there
are
days
when
she
fills
my
life
with
herself
she
gives
rise
to
manifold
emotions
which
do
not
bring
rest
it
was
not
i
who
named
her
annabel
lee
that
was
always
her
name
that
is
who
she
is
it
is
not
a
japanese
name
to
be
sure
and
she
is
certainly
a
native
of
japan
but
among
the
myriad
names
that
are
that
alone
is
the
one
which
suits
her
and
she
alone
of
the
myriad
maidens
in
the
world
is
the
one
to
wear
it
she
wears
it
matchlessly
i
have
the
friendship
of
annabel
lee
but
for
her
love
that
is
different
annabel
lee
is
like
no
one
you
have
known
she
is
quite
unlike
them
all
times
i
almost
can
feel
a
subtle
conscious
love
coming
from
her
to
my
forehead
and
i
at
am
thrilled
with
thrills
forsooth
at
in
spite
of
boston
and
all
there
are
moments
when
one
can
yet
thrill
but
other
times
i
look
up
and
perchance
her
eyes
will
meet
mine
with
a
look
that
is
cold
and
penetrating
and
contemptuous
and
confounding
other
times
i
look
up
and
see
her
eyes
full
of
indifference
full
of
tranquillity
full
of
dull
deadly
quiet
came
annabel
lee
from
out
of
boylston
street
in
boston
and
lo
she
was
so
adorable
so
fascinating
so
lovable
that
straightway
i
adored
her
i
was
fascinated
by
her
i
loved
her
i
love
her
tenderly
for
why
i
know
not
how
can
there
be
accounting
for
the
places
one
s
loves
will
rest
sometimes
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
negative
and
sometimes
she
is
positive
sometimes
when
my
mind
seems
to
have
wandered
infinitely
far
from
her
i
realize
suddenly
that
tis
she
who
holds
it
enthralled
whatsoever
i
see
in
boston
or
in
the
vision
of
the
wide
world
my
judgment
of
it
is
prejudiced
in
ways
by
the
existence
of
my
friend
annabel
lee
the
more
so
that
it
s
mostly
unconscious
prejudice
annabel
lee
s
is
an
intense
personality
one
meets
with
intense
personalities
now
and
again
in
children
or
in
or
in
persons
like
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
i
never
tire
of
looking
at
annabel
lee
and
i
never
tire
of
listening
to
her
and
i
never
tire
of
thinking
about
her
and
thinking
of
her
my
mind
grows
wistful
ii
the
flat
surfaces
of
things
there
are
moments
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
when
willy
nilly
they
must
all
come
out
upon
the
flat
surfaces
of
things
they
look
deep
into
the
green
water
as
the
sun
goes
down
and
their
mood
is
heavy
their
heart
aches
and
they
shed
no
tears
they
look
out
over
the
brilliant
waves
as
the
sun
comes
up
and
their
mood
is
and
they
enjoy
the
moment
or
else
their
heart
aches
at
the
rising
and
their
mood
is
at
the
setting
but
let
it
be
one
or
the
other
there
are
bland
moments
when
they
see
nothing
but
flat
surfaces
if
they
find
all
at
once
by
a
little
accident
that
their
is
a
traitor
friend
and
they
go
at
the
sun
s
setting
and
gaze
deep
into
the
green
water
and
all
is
dark
and
dead
as
only
a
traitor
can
make
it
and
their
mood
is
very
heavy
still
there
is
a
bland
moment
when
their
stomach
tells
them
they
are
hungry
and
they
listen
to
it
it
is
the
flat
surface
after
weeks
or
it
may
be
days
according
to
who
they
are
their
mood
will
not
be
heavy
yet
still
their
stomach
will
tell
them
they
are
hungry
and
they
will
listen
if
their
cease
to
be
suddenly
that
is
bad
for
them
oh
exceeding
bad
they
suffer
and
it
takes
weeks
for
them
to
recover
and
the
mark
of
the
wound
never
wears
away
but
with
time
s
encouraging
help
they
do
recover
but
if
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
their
stomach
should
cease
to
be
not
only
would
they
suffer
they
would
die
and
whither
away
that
is
a
flat
surface
and
a
very
truth
and
when
they
consider
it
for
one
bland
moment
they
laugh
gently
and
cease
to
have
a
entirely
they
cease
to
fill
their
veins
with
red
red
life
they
become
like
unto
mice
mice
with
long
slim
tails
for
one
bland
moment
and
too
the
bland
moment
is
long
enough
for
them
to
feel
restfully
deliciously
but
unconsciously
thankful
that
there
are
these
flat
surfaces
to
things
and
that
they
can
thus
roll
at
times
out
upon
them
they
roll
upon
the
flat
surfaces
much
as
a
horse
rolls
upon
the
flat
prairie
where
the
wind
is
and
when
for
the
first
time
they
fall
in
love
if
their
belt
is
too
tight
there
will
come
a
bland
moment
when
they
will
be
aware
that
their
belt
is
thus
tight
and
they
will
not
be
aware
of
much
else
during
that
bland
moment
they
will
loosen
their
belt
when
they
were
eight
or
nine
years
old
and
found
a
fine
ripe
patch
and
while
they
were
picking
plums
a
balloon
suddenly
appeared
over
their
heads
their
first
delirious
impulse
was
to
leave
all
and
follow
the
balloon
over
hill
and
dale
to
the
very
earth
s
end
but
even
though
a
real
live
balloon
went
sailing
over
their
heads
they
considered
this
that
other
kids
would
get
our
plums
that
we
had
a
balloon
was
glorious
a
balloon
was
divine
but
even
so
there
was
a
bland
moment
in
which
the
thought
of
some
vicious
swede
children
from
over
the
hill
who
would
rush
in
on
the
plums
came
just
in
time
to
make
the
balloon
pall
on
them
but
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
by
the
same
token
in
talking
over
the
balloon
after
it
had
vanished
down
the
sky
there
would
come
another
bland
moment
when
the
plums
would
pall
upon
them
pall
completely
and
would
appear
hateful
in
their
eyes
for
having
kept
from
them
the
joy
of
following
the
divine
balloon
that
is
another
aspect
of
the
flat
surfaces
of
things
and
they
must
all
come
out
upon
the
flat
surfaces
and
said
annabel
lee
glancing
at
me
as
my
mind
was
dimly
wistful
not
only
must
they
come
out
upon
the
flat
surfaces
of
things
but
also
you
and
i
must
come
and
since
we
come
added
the
lady
then
why
not
stay
out
upon
the
flat
surfaces
certainly
twill
save
the
trouble
of
coming
next
time
perhaps
however
it
s
all
in
the
iii
my
friend
annabel
lee
my
friend
annabel
lee
never
fails
to
fascinate
and
confound
me
much
as
she
gives
there
is
in
her
infinitely
more
to
get
my
relation
with
her
never
goes
on
and
it
never
goes
back
it
leads
nowhere
she
and
i
stop
together
in
the
midst
of
our
situation
and
look
about
us
and
what
we
see
in
the
looking
about
is
all
and
enough
to
consider
and
considering
i
write
of
it
iv
boston
yesterday
the
lady
was
in
her
most
amiable
mood
and
we
talked
together
about
boston
it
so
happened
do
you
like
boston
she
asked
me
yes
i
replied
i
am
fond
of
boston
it
fascinates
but
not
fonder
of
it
than
of
butte
in
montana
oh
no
said
i
hastily
butte
in
montana
is
my
first
love
there
are
barren
mountains
there
they
are
with
me
always
boston
doesn
t
go
to
my
heart
in
the
least
but
i
like
it
much
i
like
to
live
i
am
fond
of
boston
sometimes
annabel
lee
observed
here
by
the
sea
it
is
not
quite
boston
it
is
everything
this
sea
washes
down
by
enchanted
purple
islands
and
touches
at
the
coast
of
spain
but
if
one
can
but
turn
one
s
eyes
from
it
for
a
moment
boston
is
a
fine
and
good
thing
and
i
think
it
is
from
several
points
of
view
i
agreed
tell
me
what
you
find
that
interests
you
in
boston
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
there
are
many
things
i
replied
i
have
found
a
little
corner
down
by
the
east
boston
wharf
where
often
i
sit
on
cold
days
the
sun
shines
bright
and
warm
on
a
narrow
wooden
platform
between
two
great
barrels
and
i
can
be
hidden
there
but
i
can
watch
the
madding
crowd
as
it
goes
the
crowd
is
very
madding
down
around
east
boston
and
i
do
not
lack
company
sometimes
brave
rats
venture
out
on
the
ground
below
me
they
can
not
see
the
madding
crowd
but
they
can
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
hunt
mice
among
the
rubbish
the
dwellers
in
east
boston
they
are
the
poor
we
have
always
with
us
they
are
not
the
meek
the
worthy
the
deserving
poor
they
are
the
devilish
the
one
with
the
wharf
rats
that
hunt
for
mice
except
that
the
rats
do
occasionally
try
to
clean
their
soft
gray
coats
by
licking
them
with
their
little
red
tongues
whereas
the
poor
but
why
should
the
poor
wash
are
they
not
the
poor
as
i
rest
me
between
my
two
great
barrels
and
watch
this
grewsome
pageant
i
think
it
seems
a
quite
desperate
thing
to
be
poor
in
boston
for
boston
is
said
to
be
of
the
knowledge
and
to
carry
a
lump
of
ice
in
its
heart
from
between
my
two
barrels
in
east
boston
i
have
seen
humanity
oh
so
brutal
oh
so
barbarous
as
ever
it
could
have
been
in
merrie
england
in
the
reign
of
good
old
harry
the
and
so
then
that
is
very
in
truth
it
is
so
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
boston
is
fair
and
very
tell
me
and
times
i
said
i
sit
in
one
of
the
on
the
stairway
of
the
public
library
and
i
look
at
the
walls
a
frenchman
with
a
marvelous
fancy
and
great
skill
in
his
has
worked
on
those
walls
he
painted
there
the
emblems
of
all
the
world
s
great
material
things
of
all
ages
and
over
them
he
painted
a
thin
gray
veil
of
those
things
that
are
not
material
that
come
from
no
age
that
are
with
us
around
us
above
us
as
they
were
with
the
children
of
israel
with
the
dwellers
in
pompeii
with
the
fair
cities
of
greece
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
i
have
looked
at
the
paintings
and
i
have
been
dazzled
and
transported
what
is
there
not
upon
those
walls
i
have
seen
in
truth
the
vision
of
the
world
and
all
the
wonder
that
shall
i
have
seen
the
struggling
of
the
and
its
bursting
into
light
i
have
seen
the
divinity
that
doth
sometime
hedge
the
earth
i
have
looked
at
a
conception
of
poetry
and
i
have
heard
the
thin
rhythmic
sounds
of
shawms
and
stringed
instruments
and
i
have
heard
low
voluptuous
music
from
within
the
temple
human
voices
like
sweet
jessamine
i
have
seen
the
fascinating
idolatry
of
pagans
and
i
have
seen
pale
in
the
evening
by
the
light
of
a
star
the
wooden
figure
of
the
cross
i
have
leaned
over
the
edge
of
a
chasm
and
beheld
the
things
of
old
the
army
of
hannibal
before
carthage
the
norsemen
going
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
the
futile
savage
fighting
of
goths
and
vandals
i
have
seen
science
and
art
within
the
walled
cities
and
i
have
seen
frail
little
lambs
gamboling
by
the
side
of
the
brook
i
have
seen
lowering
over
occult
works
and
i
have
seen
bees
flying
to
their
hives
on
a
fine
summer
s
morning
i
have
heard
a
lute
played
where
a
tiny
cataract
leaps
and
the
pipes
of
pan
mingled
with
the
bubbling
notes
of
a
robin
in
mint
meadows
i
have
seen
pages
and
pages
of
printed
lines
that
reach
from
world
s
end
to
world
s
end
i
have
seen
profound
words
written
centuries
ago
in
inks
of
many
colors
i
have
seen
and
been
overwhelmed
by
the
marvels
of
scientific
things
bristling
with
the
accurate
kind
of
knowledge
that
i
shall
never
know
withal
i
have
seen
the
complete
serenity
of
the
world
s
face
as
shown
by
the
brush
of
the
frenchman
chavannes
and
over
all
the
nebulous
conception
of
the
long
ignorant
silence
what
is
there
not
upon
those
wonderful
walls
i
sit
in
in
the
little
and
these
things
swim
before
my
two
gray
eyes
my
mind
is
full
of
the
vision
of
murmuring
throbbing
life
but
what
a
thing
is
life
truly
for
marvelous
as
are
these
pictures
those
that
i
have
seen
times
down
where
the
rats
forage
among
the
rubbish
are
more
marvelous
truly
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
there
is
much
much
in
boston
tell
me
well
and
there
is
the
south
station
i
went
on
oh
not
until
one
has
ambled
and
idled
away
a
thousand
hours
in
that
place
of
trains
and
varied
peoples
can
one
know
all
of
what
is
really
to
be
found
within
its
i
have
found
massachusetts
there
not
any
massachusetts
that
i
had
ever
read
about
but
the
massachusetts
that
comes
in
from
braintree
and
plymouth
and
middleboro
carrying
a
boston
the
massachusetts
that
is
intellectual
and
thrusts
its
forefinger
through
the
handle
of
its
the
massachusetts
that
eats
soup
from
the
end
of
its
spoon
the
massachusetts
that
is
but
walks
funny
the
massachusetts
that
takes
all
the
children
and
goes
down
to
providence
for
a
day
each
of
the
children
with
a
thick
yellow
banana
in
its
hand
the
massachusetts
that
has
its
being
because
the
world
wears
shoes
for
it
is
intellectual
and
can
make
shoes
and
in
the
south
station
furthermore
there
are
people
from
the
wide
world
around
actors
and
authors
and
artists
are
to
be
seen
coming
in
and
going
out
and
sitting
waiting
in
the
some
mightily
fine
and
curious
persons
have
sat
waiting
in
those
as
well
as
dingy
italians
with
strings
of
beads
around
their
necks
and
in
the
south
station
there
are
so
many
many
people
that
once
in
a
long
while
one
can
meet
with
some
of
those
tiny
things
that
one
has
waited
for
for
centuries
in
among
a
multitude
of
faces
there
may
be
a
young
face
with
lines
of
worn
and
vivid
life
in
it
and
with
alert
and
eyes
and
with
soft
dull
hair
above
it
in
a
flash
one
recognizes
it
and
in
a
flash
it
is
gone
it
is
a
face
that
means
beautiful
things
and
one
has
known
it
and
its
divineness
a
long
long
time
and
here
in
the
south
station
in
boston
came
the
one
gold
glimpse
of
it
and
i
have
seen
in
the
south
station
a
strange
scene
that
of
a
mild
jew
man
bearing
the
brunt
of
caring
for
his
large
family
of
small
children
while
their
mother
was
allowed
for
once
in
her
life
to
rest
completely
sitting
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
hands
folded
she
might
well
rest
tranquil
in
the
thought
that
in
giving
birth
to
that
small
hebraic
army
she
had
done
her
share
of
this
dubious
world
s
penance
and
in
the
south
station
as
much
as
anywhere
one
feels
the
air
of
boston
the
air
of
boston
too
is
wonderful
and
tis
not
free
for
all
to
breathe
tis
for
the
anointed
the
others
must
content
them
with
the
untinted
unscented
air
that
blows
wild
from
and
north
seas
but
for
me
i
have
eyes
wherewith
to
see
and
since
the
air
of
boston
has
color
i
can
see
it
and
i
have
ears
wherewith
to
hear
and
since
the
air
of
boston
has
musical
vibrations
i
can
hear
it
and
i
have
sensibility
wherefore
all
that
is
pungent
in
the
air
of
boston
and
all
that
is
fine
and
all
that
is
art
and
all
that
is
beautiful
and
all
that
is
true
and
all
that
is
benign
and
particularly
all
that
is
very
cool
and
all
that
is
bitterly
contemptuous
are
not
wholly
lost
upon
me
if
all
the
persons
who
go
to
and
fro
at
the
south
station
were
heroes
and
breathed
the
air
there
and
left
their
dim
shadows
behind
them
as
they
do
i
presume
the
south
station
would
be
hallowed
ground
they
all
are
not
heroes
but
they
breathe
the
air
and
leave
their
dim
shadows
whatever
they
may
be
and
ever
after
the
air
of
the
south
station
is
tinctured
and
since
more
than
a
half
of
these
people
are
of
boston
the
air
is
tinctured
therewith
if
you
are
civilized
and
conventional
you
may
know
and
breathe
this
air
if
you
are
not
well
at
least
you
may
stand
and
contemplate
it
and
always
one
can
bide
one
s
time
my
contemplation
of
it
has
interested
me
the
air
of
boston
is
a
mingling
of
very
ancient
and
very
modern
things
and
ways
of
thinking
that
are
picturesque
and
at
times
lead
to
something
the
ancient
things
date
back
to
confucius
and
others
of
his
ilk
and
the
modern
ones
are
tinted
with
lilian
whiting
and
newspapers
and
the
theater
one
is
of
this
as
one
contemplates
and
one
s
thought
is
woe
is
me
that
i
have
my
habitation
among
the
tents
of
kedar
one
exclaims
this
not
so
much
that
one
considers
oneself
benighted
but
that
one
is
very
sure
that
the
air
of
boston
considers
one
so
to
be
sure
it
ought
to
know
but
somehow
as
yet
one
is
content
to
bide
one
s
time
but
yes
there
is
a
beatified
quality
in
the
air
of
boston
it
is
tinted
with
rose
and
blue
it
sounds
remotely
of
chimes
and
flutes
you
feel
it
perchance
when
you
sit
within
the
subdued
brilliant
stillness
of
trinity
church
when
you
walk
among
the
green
and
gold
fields
about
brookline
and
cambridge
where
orchids
are
lifting
up
their
pale
soft
lips
when
you
are
in
the
museum
of
fine
arts
and
see
hanging
on
the
wall
a
small
picture
that
is
old
so
old
music
is
in
the
air
of
boston
it
pours
into
the
heart
like
fire
and
flood
it
awakens
the
soul
from
its
dreaming
it
sends
the
human
being
out
into
the
pathways
to
see
to
suffer
it
may
be
yes
surely
to
suffer
but
to
live
oh
to
live
one
can
see
in
the
mists
the
slender
gray
figure
of
one
s
own
soul
rising
and
going
to
mingle
with
all
these
in
spite
of
the
clouds
about
it
one
knows
its
going
and
that
it
is
well
it
was
long
since
said
my
beloved
has
gone
down
into
her
garden
to
the
bed
of
spices
to
feed
in
the
gardens
and
to
gather
and
now
again
is
the
beloved
in
the
garden
and
in
those
moments
oh
life
is
fair
my
friend
annabel
lee
opened
her
lips
her
lips
like
damp
red
in
the
and
told
me
that
there
were
times
when
i
interested
her
times
when
i
amused
her
mightily
and
times
when
in
me
she
made
some
rare
discoveries
but
which
of
the
three
this
time
was
she
has
not
told
v
a
small
house
in
the
country
but
boston
or
even
butte
in
montana
is
not
to
be
compared
to
a
far
down
in
the
country
a
tiny
house
by
the
side
of
a
fishy
mossy
pond
in
with
the
hot
sun
shining
on
the
and
a
clump
of
willows
and
an
growing
near
on
the
side
of
the
house
where
the
sun
is
bright
in
the
morning
some
small
square
beds
of
radishes
and
heads
of
lettuce
and
straight
neat
rows
of
young
onions
with
the
moist
earth
showing
black
between
the
rows
and
a
few
green
peas
growing
by
a
small
fence
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
house
grass
will
grow
tall
rank
grass
and
some
hardy
weeds
and
perhaps
a
or
two
will
come
up
unawares
the
fishy
pond
will
not
be
too
near
the
house
nor
too
far
away
but
near
enough
so
that
the
singing
of
the
frogs
in
the
night
will
sound
clear
and
loud
rolling
hills
will
be
lying
fair
and
green
at
a
distance
and
cattle
will
wander
and
graze
upon
them
in
the
shade
of
branches
on
still
afternoons
a
quail
or
a
pheasant
will
be
heard
calling
in
the
woods
the
air
that
will
blow
down
the
long
gentle
uplands
will
be
very
sweet
the
message
that
it
brings
as
it
touches
my
cheeks
and
my
lips
and
my
forehead
will
be
one
of
exceeding
deep
peace
i
would
live
in
the
little
house
with
a
friend
of
my
heart
a
friend
in
the
shadows
and
and
brilliances
for
if
the
hearts
of
two
are
tuned
in
accord
the
harmony
may
be
of
exquisite
tenor
in
the
very
early
morning
i
would
sit
on
the
doorstep
where
the
sun
shines
and
my
eyes
would
look
off
at
the
prospect
life
would
throb
in
my
veins
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
i
would
be
kneeling
in
the
beds
of
radishes
and
slim
young
onions
and
lettuce
pulling
the
weeds
from
among
them
and
staining
my
two
hands
with
black
roots
in
the
middle
of
the
day
i
would
sit
in
the
shade
but
where
i
could
see
the
sunshine
touching
the
brilliant
greenness
near
the
house
and
afar
and
i
could
see
the
pond
glaring
with
beams
and
motes
in
the
late
afternoon
i
with
the
friend
of
my
heart
would
walk
down
among
the
green
valleys
and
wooded
hills
by
fences
and
crumbling
stone
walls
until
we
reached
a
point
of
vantage
where
we
could
see
the
sea
in
the
night
when
the
sun
had
gone
and
the
earth
had
cooled
and
the
dark
dark
gray
had
fallen
over
all
we
would
sit
again
on
the
doorstep
it
would
be
lonesome
there
with
the
sound
of
the
frogs
and
of
and
there
would
be
a
cricket
chirping
we
would
speak
to
each
other
with
one
or
two
words
through
long
stillnesses
presently
would
come
the
dead
midnight
and
we
would
be
in
heavy
sleep
beneath
the
low
hot
roof
of
the
little
house
mingled
with
the
dead
midnight
would
be
memories
of
the
day
that
had
just
gone
in
my
sleep
i
would
seem
to
walk
again
in
the
meadows
and
the
green
of
the
countless
would
affect
me
with
a
strange
delirium
as
if
now
for
the
first
time
i
saw
them
each
little
would
have
a
voice
and
would
shout
maclane
oh
we
are
the
and
we
are
here
we
are
the
we
are
the
and
we
are
here
and
yes
that
would
be
the
marvelous
thing
that
they
were
and
would
not
the
leaves
be
upon
the
trees
and
would
not
tiny
pale
flowers
be
growing
in
the
ground
and
would
not
the
sky
be
over
all
oh
the
unspeakable
sky
in
the
dead
midnight
sleep
would
leave
me
and
i
would
wake
in
a
vision
of
beauty
and
of
horror
with
fear
at
my
heart
with
horrible
fear
at
my
heart
then
frantically
i
would
think
of
the
little
outside
the
window
how
common
and
how
satisfying
they
were
thus
thinking
i
would
sleep
again
and
wake
to
the
sun
s
shining
you
would
not
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
stay
long
in
such
a
i
looked
at
her
its
simplicity
and
truth
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
would
deal
you
deep
wounds
and
scourge
you
and
drive
you
forth
as
if
you
were
indeed
a
in
the
vi
the
soul
annabel
lee
leaned
her
two
elbows
on
the
back
of
a
tiny
sandalwood
chair
and
looked
down
at
me
we
regarded
each
other
coldly
as
friends
do
times
you
said
annabel
lee
have
a
soul
such
a
soul
that
when
it
hears
a
strain
of
music
can
hear
away
to
the
music
s
depths
but
can
understand
only
of
its
meaning
but
because
it
is
it
knows
that
it
understands
only
the
half
and
must
need
weep
for
the
other
half
such
a
soul
that
when
it
wanders
into
the
deep
green
and
meets
there
a
with
long
dark
hair
and
an
enchanting
voice
it
feels
to
its
depths
the
spirit
of
the
green
and
the
voice
of
the
but
can
understand
only
of
what
they
tell
but
because
it
is
it
knows
that
it
understands
only
the
half
and
must
need
weep
for
the
other
half
such
a
soul
that
when
it
is
bound
and
fettered
heavily
it
knows
since
it
is
that
it
is
bound
and
fettered
but
knows
not
why
nor
wherefore
nor
whether
it
is
well
which
is
the
other
half
and
it
must
need
weep
for
it
such
a
soul
that
when
it
hears
thunderings
in
the
wild
sky
will
awaken
from
sleep
and
listen
listen
but
since
it
is
it
can
only
hear
not
know
and
it
sounds
like
an
unknown
voice
in
an
unknown
language
telling
the
dying
speech
of
its
it
is
frantic
to
know
the
translation
which
is
the
other
half
such
a
soul
that
when
life
gathers
itself
up
from
around
it
and
stands
before
it
and
says
now
contemplate
life
it
contemplates
since
it
is
but
it
for
that
same
reason
strains
its
eyes
to
look
over
life
s
shoulders
into
the
dimness
which
is
an
impossible
thing
and
the
other
half
such
a
soul
that
when
it
finds
itself
mingling
in
love
for
its
friend
and
all
it
enjoys
oh
vividly
in
all
moments
but
the
crucial
moments
when
it
aches
in
torment
and
doubt
for
it
is
and
so
knows
its
lacking
desolate
is
the
way
of
the
soul
said
annabel
lee
the
wholly
conscious
soul
receives
into
itself
things
in
their
entirety
without
question
or
wonder
the
soul
receives
the
half
of
things
and
knowing
that
there
is
another
half
it
wonders
and
questions
till
all
s
black
the
wholly
conscious
soul
is
different
from
the
wholly
unconscious
soul
in
that
the
former
is
positive
whilst
the
latter
is
negative
and
they
both
in
their
nature
can
find
rest
but
the
soul
knows
that
it
is
still
it
knows
not
at
what
points
it
is
conscious
and
at
what
points
unconscious
for
when
it
thinks
itself
conscious
lo
it
is
unconscious
and
when
it
thinks
itself
unconscious
it
is
heavily
bitterly
conscious
and
nowhere
can
it
find
rest
the
wholly
conscious
soul
holds
up
before
its
eyes
a
mirror
and
gazes
at
itself
its
color
its
texture
its
quality
its
desires
and
motives
without
flinching
in
the
strong
light
of
day
the
wholly
unconscious
soul
knows
not
that
it
is
a
soul
and
never
uses
a
mirror
but
the
soul
looks
into
its
glass
in
the
gray
light
of
dusk
it
sees
its
color
its
texture
its
quality
its
desires
but
its
motives
are
hidden
its
eyes
are
wide
in
the
gray
light
to
learn
what
those
its
own
motives
are
it
can
not
know
but
it
can
never
rest
for
trying
to
know
the
wholly
conscious
soul
knows
its
love
its
sorrow
its
bitterness
its
remorse
the
soul
knows
its
love
and
wonders
why
it
loves
and
wonders
if
it
really
can
love
any
but
itself
and
wonders
that
it
cares
for
love
the
soul
knows
its
sorrow
and
marvels
that
it
should
have
sorrow
since
it
can
grasp
not
truth
the
soul
knows
its
bitterness
and
realizes
at
once
its
right
to
and
its
reason
for
bitterness
but
thinking
of
it
the
arrow
is
turned
in
the
wound
the
soul
knows
its
remorse
but
it
is
convinced
that
it
has
no
right
to
remorse
since
it
does
its
unworthy
acts
with
infinite
forethought
the
wholly
conscious
soul
is
a
chastened
spirit
and
so
has
its
measure
of
happiness
the
wholly
unconscious
soul
is
an
unchastened
spirit
for
it
deserves
no
chastisement
neither
has
it
any
happiness
for
it
knows
not
whether
it
is
happy
or
otherwise
but
the
soul
is
chastised
where
it
is
not
deserving
of
it
and
goes
unchastised
where
it
is
richly
deserving
of
it
and
so
has
no
happiness
but
instead
unhappiness
woe
to
the
soul
said
annabel
lee
how
brilliantly
does
the
emerald
sea
flash
in
the
sunshine
before
the
eyes
of
the
soul
but
burns
it
with
how
is
the
perfume
of
the
blue
anemone
to
the
sense
of
the
soul
but
burns
it
with
how
beautiful
are
the
bronze
lights
in
the
eyes
of
its
friend
to
the
soul
that
burn
it
with
how
joyous
is
the
soul
at
the
sounds
of
singing
voices
on
water
that
burn
it
with
how
surely
come
the
wild
sweet
meanings
of
the
outer
air
into
the
depths
of
the
soul
but
burn
it
with
how
madly
happy
is
the
soul
in
still
hours
at
sight
of
a
solitary
upon
the
that
burns
it
with
how
tenderly
comes
truth
to
the
soul
in
the
dead
watches
of
the
night
but
burns
it
with
life
is
vivid
alert
telling
to
the
soul
said
annabel
lee
you
said
annabel
lee
with
your
soul
when
you
sit
where
the
gray
waves
wash
the
at
when
you
sit
listening
with
your
head
bent
and
your
hands
dead
cold
you
think
you
realize
your
life
you
think
you
know
its
hardness
you
think
you
have
measured
the
cruelty
they
will
give
you
but
you
do
not
know
you
know
but
half
you
weep
for
the
other
half
though
it
be
horror
still
though
you
are
but
though
you
weep
for
the
other
half
when
you
sit
listening
with
your
head
bent
and
your
hands
dead
cold
where
the
gray
waves
wash
the
at
yet
you
know
some
of
each
one
of
the
things
that
are
around
you
wonderful
in
conception
is
the
soul
said
annabel
i
looked
hard
at
my
friend
annabel
lee
was
she
teasing
me
was
she
laughing
at
me
for
she
does
tease
me
and
she
does
laugh
at
me
and
was
she
at
either
of
these
pastimes
with
all
this
about
a
soul
but
here
again
she
left
me
ignorant
of
her
thought
and
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
vii
the
of
trowbridge
there
are
two
writers
among
them
all
to
whom
i
owe
thanks
for
countless
hours
of
complete
pleasure
not
the
pleasure
that
stirs
and
fires
one
but
the
pleasure
which
enters
into
the
entire
personality
and
rests
and
satisfies
a
common
unstrained
mind
tis
the
same
pleasure
that
comes
with
eating
all
by
myself
eating
peaches
and
a
fine
tiny
lamb
chop
in
the
middle
of
the
day
one
of
these
two
writers
is
trowbridge
who
has
written
often
i
have
thought
life
would
be
different
and
duller
colored
and
less
thickly
sprinkled
with
had
i
never
known
my
trowbridge
often
i
have
thanked
the
happy
fate
that
put
into
my
hands
my
first
of
trowbridge
twas
when
i
was
fourteen
one
day
in
october
when
i
lived
in
a
flat
windy
town
that
was
named
great
falls
in
montana
since
that
time
i
have
never
been
without
the
of
trowbridge
there
have
but
seven
years
passed
since
then
but
when
seven
years
more
and
seven
years
again
up
to
threescore
have
gone
i
still
shall
spend
my
my
my
unstrained
hours
with
the
of
trowbridge
when
i
go
to
a
theater
i
enjoy
it
thoroughly
a
theater
is
a
good
thing
and
the
actor
is
a
stunning
person
but
how
eagerly
and
gladly
i
come
back
into
my
own
room
where
there
is
a
faithful
little
tan
deer
standing
waiting
all
so
pathetic
and
sweet
upon
the
desk
when
i
go
out
into
two
crowded
rooms
among
some
fascinating
persons
that
i
have
heard
of
before
women
with
gowns
i
like
that
too
and
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
it
but
how
utterly
restful
and
adorable
it
is
to
come
back
to
my
own
room
where
there
is
my
comfortable
quiet
friend
in
a
rusty
black
flannel
frock
sitting
waiting
and
her
hands
so
soft
and
good
to
feel
when
i
read
gold
treasures
of
literature
vergil
it
may
be
or
a
browning
or
kipling
i
am
enchanted
and
enthralled
i
marvel
at
these
people
and
how
they
can
write
i
think
how
marvelous
is
writing
at
last
but
how
gladly
and
thankfully
after
two
hours
or
three
i
return
back
to
these
my
of
trowbridge
they
are
about
people
living
on
farms
and
they
are
written
so
that
you
know
that
grows
among
and
must
be
weeded
out
and
that
the
farmer
s
boys
have
to
milk
the
cows
mornings
before
breakfast
and
evenings
after
supper
for
they
have
supper
in
the
trowbridge
books
and
it
is
even
attractive
and
tastes
good
when
the
lads
go
to
gather
kelp
to
spread
on
the
land
and
are
gone
for
the
day
by
the
seashore
they
eat
roasted
ears
of
corn
and
eggs
and
and
three
bottles
of
spruce
beer
and
if
you
really
know
the
trowbridge
books
you
can
eat
of
these
with
them
and
with
a
wonderful
appetite
when
a
slim
boy
of
sixteen
goes
to
hunt
for
his
uncle
s
horse
that
had
been
stolen
in
the
night
because
the
boy
left
the
stable
door
unlocked
along
pleasant
country
roads
and
smiling
farms
in
massachusetts
if
you
really
know
the
trowbridge
books
the
slim
boy
of
sixteen
is
not
more
anxious
to
find
the
horse
than
you
are
when
the
boy
and
the
reader
first
start
after
the
horse
they
are
far
too
wretched
and
anxious
to
eat
for
the
crabbed
uncle
told
them
they
needn
t
come
back
to
the
farm
without
that
horse
but
long
before
noon
they
are
glad
enough
that
they
have
a
few
doubled
slices
of
buttered
bread
to
eat
as
they
go
when
at
last
they
come
upon
the
horse
calmly
feeding
under
a
at
a
county
fair
twenty
miles
away
they
are
quite
hungry
and
in
their
joy
they
purchase
a
wedge
of
pie
and
some
oyster
crackers
so
that
they
needn
t
be
out
of
sight
of
the
horse
while
they
eat
and
the
reader
if
he
really
knows
the
trowbridge
books
would
fain
stop
here
for
there
is
trouble
ahead
of
him
he
would
fain
but
he
can
not
he
must
go
on
he
must
even
come
in
crucial
contact
with
eli
badger
s
hickory
club
he
must
go
with
the
boy
until
he
sees
him
and
the
horse
at
last
safely
back
at
uncle
gray
s
farm
the
horse
placidly
munching
oats
in
his
own
stall
and
the
boy
eating
supper
once
more
with
appetite
unimpaired
and
the
crabbed
uncle
once
more
serene
and
if
you
know
trowbridge
s
books
you
can
eat
too
tranquilly
when
a
boy
is
left
alone
in
the
world
by
the
death
of
his
aunt
and
starts
out
to
find
his
uncle
in
cincinnati
if
you
know
trowbridge
s
books
you
prepare
for
hardship
and
weariness
but
still
occasional
sandwiches
and
doughnuts
but
not
the
greasy
kind
and
always
you
know
there
must
be
a
haven
in
the
house
of
the
uncle
in
cincinnati
only
if
you
know
the
trowbridge
books
you
are
fearful
when
you
get
to
the
uncle
s
door
and
you
would
a
little
rather
the
boy
went
in
to
meet
him
while
you
waited
outside
trowbridge
s
uncles
are
apt
to
be
so
sour
as
to
heart
and
so
bitter
as
to
tongue
and
so
sarcastic
in
their
remarks
relating
to
boys
who
come
in
from
the
country
to
the
city
in
order
that
they
the
uncles
may
have
the
privilege
of
supporting
them
though
you
know
if
you
know
the
trowbridge
books
that
trowbridge
s
boys
never
come
into
the
city
for
that
purpose
the
uncles
too
are
made
aware
of
this
before
long
and
change
the
tenor
of
their
remarks
accordingly
and
after
some
just
pride
on
the
part
of
the
nephews
all
goes
well
whereupon
your
feeling
of
satisfaction
is
more
than
that
of
the
boy
of
the
uncle
of
trowbridge
himself
but
these
roasted
ears
of
corn
and
eggs
are
among
the
lesser
delights
of
the
of
trowbridge
the
most
fascinating
things
in
them
are
the
conversations
they
are
so
real
that
you
hear
the
voices
and
see
the
expressions
of
the
faces
trowbridge
is
one
of
the
kind
that
listens
twice
and
thrice
to
persons
talking
so
that
he
hears
the
and
the
detail
and
his
pen
is
of
the
kind
that
can
write
what
he
hears
it
is
never
too
much
never
too
little
it
is
not
noticeable
at
all
because
it
is
all
harmony
it
is
entirely
and
utterly
common
and
it
is
real
in
the
of
trowbridge
and
nowhere
else
i
have
heard
boys
talking
together
so
that
i
knew
how
their
faces
looked
and
how
carelessly
and
loosely
their
various
collars
were
worn
and
their
dubious
hats
i
have
heard
a
grasping
grouty
old
man
pound
on
the
kitchen
floor
with
his
cane
he
had
come
over
while
the
family
were
at
breakfast
to
inform
them
that
their
dog
had
killed
five
of
his
sheep
and
to
demand
the
dog
s
life
i
have
heard
the
lessons
and
other
things
they
said
in
a
country
sixty
years
ago
where
boys
were
sometimes
obliged
for
punishment
to
sit
on
nothing
against
the
door
i
have
heard
the
extreme
discontent
in
the
voice
of
another
grouty
grasping
farmer
when
it
became
evident
to
him
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
give
up
a
horse
that
had
been
stolen
before
he
bought
him
but
here
i
must
quote
as
nearly
correctly
as
i
can
without
the
book
and
sold
him
to
this
badger
said
kit
for
seventy
seventy
exclaimed
uncle
gray
aghast
i
should
think
any
fool
might
know
he
s
worth
more
than
he
was
thinking
of
brunlow
but
eli
applied
the
remark
to
himself
i
did
know
it
he
growled
that
s
why
i
bought
him
and
mighty
glad
i
am
now
i
didn
t
pay
sartin
replied
uncle
gray
but
didn
t
it
occur
to
you
t
no
honest
man
would
want
to
sell
an
honest
hoss
like
that
for
any
such
sum
i
didn
t
know
it
said
eli
groutily
he
told
a
pooty
straight
story
i
got
took
in
that
s
took
in
repeated
uncle
gray
i
should
say
took
in
i
know
the
rogue
and
i
m
amazed
that
any
man
with
common
sense
and
eyes
in
his
head
shouldn
t
a
seen
through
him
at
maybe
i
ain
t
got
common
sense
and
maybe
i
ain
t
got
eyes
in
my
head
said
eli
with
a
dull
fire
in
the
place
where
eyes
should
have
been
if
he
had
had
any
but
i
didn
t
expect
kit
hastened
to
interpose
between
the
two
always
i
have
been
sorry
that
the
boy
interposed
just
there
i
have
read
the
book
surely
times
each
time
this
talk
over
the
horse
comes
exceeding
pungent
to
my
ears
how
impossible
it
is
to
weary
of
trowbridge
because
there
is
no
effort
in
the
writing
and
no
effort
in
the
reading
and
because
of
a
sense
of
how
flat
seem
these
words
the
of
trowbridge
can
not
be
set
down
in
words
what
with
the
simplicity
what
with
the
quality
of
naturalness
what
with
a
delicate
tenderness
for
all
human
things
what
with
the
rare
rare
quality
of
commonness
that
is
satisfying
and
quieting
as
the
vision
of
a
little
green
what
with
an
inner
sympathy
between
trowbridge
and
his
characters
and
above
all
an
inner
sympathy
with
his
readers
what
with
truth
itself
and
the
sweet
gift
of
portraying
the
sunshiny
days
as
they
are
why
talk
of
trowbridge
is
it
not
all
there
written
can
one
not
read
and
rest
in
it
viii
give
me
three
grains
of
corn
mother
no
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
can
t
really
say
that
i
care
for
trowbridge
all
that
you
have
said
is
true
enough
but
he
fails
to
interest
what
do
you
like
in
literature
i
asked
regarding
her
with
interest
for
i
had
never
heard
her
say
it
must
need
be
something
characteristic
of
herself
i
like
strength
and
i
like
simplicity
and
i
like
emotion
and
i
like
vital
things
always
and
i
like
poetry
rather
than
prose
just
now
said
annabel
lee
i
am
thinking
of
an
bit
of
verse
that
to
me
is
all
that
a
poem
need
be
to
have
written
it
is
to
have
done
enough
in
the
way
of
writing
because
it
s
real
like
your
oh
will
you
repeat
it
for
me
i
said
it
is
called
give
me
three
grains
of
corn
it
is
of
a
famine
in
ireland
a
great
many
years
ago
a
lad
and
his
mother
and
then
she
went
on
give
me
three
grains
of
corn
mother
give
me
three
grains
of
corn
twill
keep
the
little
life
i
have
till
the
coming
of
the
morn
i
am
dying
of
hunger
and
cold
mother
dying
of
hunger
and
cold
and
half
the
agony
of
such
a
death
my
lips
have
never
told
it
has
gnawed
like
a
wolf
at
my
heart
mother
a
wolf
that
is
fierce
for
blood
all
the
livelong
day
and
the
night
beside
gnawing
for
lack
of
food
i
dreamed
of
bread
in
my
sleep
mother
and
the
sight
was
heaven
to
see
i
awoke
with
an
eager
famishing
lip
but
you
had
no
bread
for
me
how
could
i
look
to
you
mother
how
could
i
look
to
you
for
bread
to
give
to
your
starving
boy
when
you
were
starving
too
for
i
read
the
famine
in
your
cheek
and
in
your
eye
so
wild
and
i
felt
it
in
your
bony
hand
as
you
laid
it
on
your
child
the
queen
has
lands
and
gold
mother
the
queen
has
lands
and
gold
while
you
are
forced
to
your
empty
breast
a
skeleton
babe
to
hold
a
babe
that
is
dying
of
want
mother
as
i
am
dying
now
with
a
ghastly
look
in
its
sunken
eye
and
the
famine
upon
its
brow
what
has
poor
ireland
done
mother
what
has
poor
ireland
done
that
the
world
looks
on
and
sees
us
die
perishing
one
by
one
do
the
men
of
england
care
not
mother
the
great
men
and
the
high
for
the
suffering
sons
of
erin
s
isle
whether
they
live
or
die
there
s
many
a
brave
heart
here
mother
dying
of
want
and
cold
while
only
across
the
channel
mother
are
many
that
roll
in
gold
there
are
great
and
proud
men
there
mother
with
wondrous
wealth
to
view
and
the
bread
they
fling
to
their
dogs
would
bring
life
to
me
and
you
come
nearer
to
my
side
mother
come
nearer
to
my
side
and
hold
me
fondly
as
you
held
my
father
when
he
died
quick
for
i
can
not
see
you
mother
my
breath
is
almost
gone
mother
dear
mother
ere
i
die
give
me
three
grains
of
corn
what
do
you
think
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
it
not
full
of
power
and
poetry
and
pathos
yes
it
could
not
in
itself
be
better
i
replied
and
it
has
the
and
pretends
nothing
said
annabel
lee
and
who
wrote
it
i
asked
oh
some
forgotten
englishwoman
said
annabel
lee
i
believe
her
name
was
edwards
she
perhaps
wrote
a
poem
now
and
then
and
and
are
the
poems
forgotten
also
i
inquired
yes
forgotten
except
by
a
few
but
when
they
remember
them
they
remember
them
then
which
is
better
to
be
remembered
and
remembered
shortly
by
the
multitudes
or
to
be
forgot
by
the
multitudes
and
remembered
long
by
the
one
or
two
it
is
incomparably
better
to
be
remembered
long
by
the
one
or
two
said
annabel
lee
to
be
forgotten
by
any
one
or
anything
that
once
remembered
you
is
sorely
bitter
to
the
ix
relative
do
you
think
annabel
lee
i
said
to
her
on
a
day
that
i
felt
depressed
that
all
things
must
really
be
relative
and
that
those
which
are
not
now
properly
relative
will
eventually
become
so
though
it
gives
them
acute
anguish
the
face
of
annabel
lee
was
placid
and
also
the
sea
the
one
glanced
down
upon
me
from
the
shelf
and
the
other
spread
away
into
the
distance
were
that
face
and
that
sea
relative
surely
they
could
not
be
since
those
two
things
in
their
very
nature
might
go
ungoverned
do
not
universal
laws
in
extreme
moments
give
way
relative
said
annabel
lee
nothing
is
relative
i
tell
you
nothing
is
relative
i
am
come
out
of
japan
in
japan
when
i
was
very
new
to
everything
there
was
an
ugly
woman
who
washed
me
and
anointed
me
and
dressed
me
in
silk
the
while
she
pinched
my
little
white
arms
cruelly
so
that
my
little
red
mouth
writhed
with
the
pain
also
the
woman
looked
into
my
suffering
young
eyes
with
her
ugly
so
that
my
tiny
young
soul
was
prodded
as
with
the
woman
did
these
things
to
hurt
me
she
hated
me
for
being
one
of
the
very
lovely
creatures
in
japan
she
was
a
vile
ugly
wretch
that
was
not
relative
i
tell
you
that
was
not
relative
said
annabel
lee
if
i
had
been
an
awkward
overgrown
bloodless
animal
and
that
woman
had
pinched
my
little
white
arms
still
would
have
been
a
vile
ugly
wretch
if
i
had
been
a
vicious
spirit
and
that
woman
had
looked
into
my
vicious
eyes
with
her
ugly
still
would
have
been
a
vile
ugly
wretch
if
i
had
been
a
hateful
little
thing
instead
of
a
maiden
and
that
woman
had
hated
me
with
all
her
still
would
have
been
a
vile
ugly
wretch
if
that
woman
had
stood
alone
in
japan
with
no
human
being
to
compare
her
to
still
the
woman
would
have
been
a
vile
ugly
wretch
she
has
left
her
horrid
on
my
fair
soul
not
anything
beneath
the
worshiped
sun
can
ever
blot
out
the
horrid
from
my
fair
soul
a
thousand
curses
on
the
ugly
woman
said
annabel
lee
tranquilly
then
that
for
one
thing
is
not
relative
i
said
but
perhaps
that
is
because
of
the
power
and
the
depth
of
your
eyes
and
your
fair
soul
where
there
are
no
eyes
and
no
fair
souls
at
least
where
the
eyes
and
the
fair
souls
can
not
be
considered
as
themselves
but
only
as
things
without
feeling
for
life
then
are
not
things
relative
nothing
is
relative
said
annabel
lee
if
your
dog
s
splendid
fur
coat
is
full
of
fleas
and
you
caress
your
dog
with
your
hands
then
presently
you
may
acquire
numbers
of
the
fleas
you
love
the
dog
but
you
do
not
love
the
fleas
you
forgive
the
fleas
for
the
love
of
the
dog
though
you
hate
them
no
less
so
then
that
is
not
relative
if
that
were
relative
you
would
love
the
fleas
a
little
for
the
same
reason
that
you
forgive
them
for
love
of
your
dog
forgiveness
is
a
negative
quality
and
can
have
no
bearing
on
your
attitude
toward
the
having
said
this
annabel
lee
gazed
placidly
over
my
head
at
the
sea
when
her
mood
is
thus
tranquil
she
talks
graciously
and
evenly
and
positively
and
is
beautiful
to
look
at
my
mind
was
now
in
much
confusion
upon
the
subject
in
question
but
i
felt
that
i
must
know
all
that
annabel
lee
thought
about
it
what
would
you
say
annabel
lee
said
i
to
a
case
like
this
if
a
soul
were
at
variance
with
everything
that
touches
it
everything
that
makes
life
so
that
it
must
struggle
through
the
long
nights
and
long
days
with
bitterness
is
not
that
because
the
soul
has
no
sense
of
proportion
and
has
not
made
itself
properly
relative
to
each
and
everything
that
is
relative
so
that
when
one
hard
thing
touches
it
simultaneously
one
soft
thing
will
touch
it
or
when
it
mourns
for
dead
days
simultaneously
it
rejoices
for
live
ones
or
when
its
gives
it
a
deep
wound
simultaneously
its
best
enemy
gives
it
vivid
nothing
is
relative
again
said
annabel
lee
nothing
can
be
relative
nothing
need
be
relative
if
a
soul
is
wearing
itself
to
small
shreds
by
struggling
days
and
nights
that
is
a
matter
relating
peculiarly
to
the
soul
and
to
nothing
else
else
if
a
soul
is
wearing
itself
to
small
shreds
by
struggling
the
more
fool
it
it
is
struggling
because
of
things
that
would
never
struggle
because
of
it
in
truth
not
one
of
them
would
move
itself
one
millionth
of
an
inch
because
of
so
paltry
a
thing
as
a
i
looked
at
annabel
lee
her
hair
her
hands
and
her
eyes
as
i
looked
i
was
reminded
of
the
word
a
human
being
is
a
quite
wonderful
thing
truly
and
great
there
s
none
greater
annabel
lee
is
a
person
who
always
says
truth
for
for
her
there
is
nothing
else
to
say
she
has
reached
that
marvelous
point
where
a
human
being
expects
nothing
if
the
days
of
a
life
annabel
lee
i
said
are
made
bright
because
of
two
other
lives
that
are
dear
to
it
and
if
the
life
happens
upon
a
day
when
the
thought
of
the
two
whom
it
loves
makes
its
own
heart
like
lead
then
what
can
there
be
to
smooth
away
its
weariness
in
heaven
above
in
the
earth
beneath
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
foolish
life
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
there
is
no
pain
in
japan
like
what
comes
of
loving
some
one
or
some
thing
and
if
the
some
one
or
the
some
thing
is
the
only
thing
the
life
can
call
its
own
then
woe
to
it
the
things
it
needs
are
three
a
lodging
place
in
heaven
above
a
bit
of
hardness
in
the
earth
beneath
a
last
resort
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
these
three
but
no
life
has
ever
had
in
the
end
i
said
when
all
wide
roadways
come
together
and
all
heavy
hearts
are
alert
to
know
what
will
happen
then
will
there
not
indeed
be
one
grand
adjustment
and
life
and
all
become
at
once
magnificently
relative
never
it
can
t
be
so
nothing
is
relative
said
annabel
lee
on
a
day
that
i
felt
depressed
x
minnie
maddern
fiske
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
i
went
to
the
theater
and
we
saw
a
wonderful
and
fascinating
woman
with
long
hair
upon
the
stage
she
is
attractive
that
woman
adorably
attractive
and
she
reminds
one
of
many
things
annabel
lee
was
greatly
interested
in
her
acting
and
was
charmed
with
herself
and
so
was
i
do
you
suppose
she
finds
life
very
delightful
i
said
to
my
friend
i
don
t
suppose
my
friend
replied
she
is
of
the
sort
that
considers
whether
or
not
life
is
delightful
probably
her
work
is
hard
enough
to
keep
her
out
of
mischief
of
any
whereupon
we
both
fell
to
thinking
how
fortunate
are
they
whose
work
is
hard
enough
to
keep
them
out
of
mischief
of
any
kind
but
there
must
be
i
said
some
months
perhaps
in
the
summer
when
she
doesn
t
work
i
have
heard
that
some
actors
take
houses
among
the
mountains
and
do
their
own
housework
for
i
said
annabel
lee
can
not
quite
imagine
this
woman
with
the
red
hair
making
bread
and
scouring
pans
and
kettles
for
pleasure
but
very
likely
she
sometimes
goes
into
the
country
for
vacations
and
i
can
fancy
her
doing
the
various
small
enjoyable
things
that
celebrities
can
afford
to
do
like
wading
barefooted
in
a
narrow
brooklet
or
swinging
high
and
recklessly
in
a
and
since
she
is
so
adorable
on
the
stage
i
exclaimed
how
altogether
enchanting
she
would
be
wading
in
the
brooklet
or
swinging
in
the
hammock
she
with
the
long
red
hair
perhaps
it
would
even
be
braided
down
her
back
in
two
long
it
is
a
picture
that
haunts
me
fiske
in
the
midst
of
her
vacation
doing
the
small
enjoyable
things
of
course
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
we
don
t
that
she
doesn
t
spend
her
vacations
in
a
fine
conventional
stupid
yacht
or
at
some
magnificent
insipid
american
or
english
country
house
we
can
only
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
yes
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
replied
how
fascinating
she
was
to
be
sure
with
her
personality
merged
in
that
of
mary
magdalene
the
magdalene
is
no
longer
a
shadowy
ideal
with
a
somewhat
buxom
body
scantily
draped
with
indefinite
hair
and
with
the
lifeless
beauty
that
the
old
masters
paint
nor
is
she
quite
the
woman
of
the
scriptures
who
is
presented
to
one
s
mind
without
that
quality
which
is
called
local
coloring
and
with
too
much
of
the
quality
that
is
ever
present
with
the
women
in
the
scriptures
a
something
between
uncleanness
and
final
complete
redemption
no
mary
magdalene
is
fiske
a
slight
woman
still
in
the
last
throes
of
youth
with
two
shoulders
which
move
impatiently
expressing
indescribable
emotions
of
aliveness
and
two
lips
which
perform
their
office
that
of
coloring
bewitching
torturing
perfuming
anointing
the
words
that
come
out
of
them
apart
from
these
lips
mary
magdalene
s
face
has
a
wonderfully
round
and
childish
look
and
her
two
round
eyes
at
first
sight
give
one
an
idea
of
positive
innocence
in
the
magdalene
s
face
and
in
that
of
an
actor
of
fiske
s
range
these
are
a
beautifully
delicate
incongruity
and
my
friend
annabel
lee
has
told
me
that
the
strongest
things
are
the
delicate
incongruities
the
strongest
in
all
this
wide
world
because
they
make
you
consider
and
considering
you
wait
with
such
a
pair
of
round
innocent
eyes
of
some
grayish
color
who
can
blame
mary
magdalene
in
the
latter
acts
of
the
play
these
eyes
go
one
step
farther
than
innocence
they
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
and
ah
dear
heaven
you
thought
to
yourself
how
well
they
did
it
to
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
not
herself
but
her
eyes
that
was
this
mary
magdalene
s
art
this
mary
magdalene
though
she
is
indeed
in
the
last
throes
of
youth
without
reference
to
the
years
she
may
know
has
yet
beneath
her
chin
a
very
charming
roundness
of
flesh
which
one
day
obviously
will
become
a
double
chin
just
now
it
is
enchanting
there
are
feminine
children
of
seven
and
eight
with
round
faces
who
have
just
that
fullness
beneath
the
chin
and
beneath
the
chin
of
mary
magdalene
and
added
to
her
eyes
it
carries
on
the
idea
of
innocence
and
inexperience
to
a
rare
good
degree
any
other
woman
actor
would
have
long
since
massaged
this
fullness
away
forsooth
perhaps
this
is
the
one
woman
actor
who
could
wear
such
a
thing
with
beauty
mary
magdalene
s
hair
in
its
deep
redness
is
scornful
and
aggressive
in
the
first
acts
of
the
play
in
the
latter
acts
it
assumes
a
marvelous
patheticness
and
if
you
like
there
is
a
world
of
patheticness
in
red
hair
if
mary
magdalene
s
hair
were
of
a
different
color
if
the
bronze
shadows
were
yellow
or
gray
or
black
or
brown
shadows
her
lips
and
her
shoulders
were
in
vain
on
the
stage
mary
magdalene
stands
with
her
back
to
her
audience
she
stands
calm
and
placid
for
three
or
four
minutes
before
the
rising
and
falling
curtain
graciously
permitting
all
to
admire
and
feast
their
eyes
upon
the
red
of
her
hair
she
knows
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
that
she
can
make
her
face
bewitching
and
she
knows
also
that
her
hair
is
bewitching
without
being
so
made
and
she
chooses
that
the
world
at
large
shall
know
it
she
has
has
mary
magdalene
it
is
her
will
her
strength
her
concentration
of
all
her
power
to
herself
that
makes
her
thus
bewitching
and
that
seduces
the
brains
of
those
who
sit
watching
her
as
she
moves
upon
the
stage
she
controls
all
her
mental
and
physical
features
with
metallic
precision
except
her
hair
and
that
she
leaves
uncontrolled
to
do
its
own
work
it
does
its
work
well
she
has
cultivated
that
mobileness
of
her
lips
probably
with
hard
work
and
infinite
patience
and
she
makes
them
damp
and
brilliant
with
rouge
she
rubs
the
soft
thick
skin
of
her
face
with
layers
of
grease
she
loads
her
two
white
arms
with
limitless
powder
and
the
two
childish
eyes
are
exceeding
as
to
lid
and
lash
with
black
crayon
one
experiences
a
revulsion
as
one
contemplates
them
through
a
glass
her
voice
in
the
days
of
her
youth
had
drilled
into
it
the
power
to
thrill
and
vibrate
and
to
become
exquisitely
tender
upon
occasion
and
now
it
does
the
bidding
of
its
owner
with
docility
and
skill
since
its
owner
has
forcefulness
and
a
power
of
selfish
concentration
the
voice
is
mostly
magnetic
and
cold
and
strong
it
is
magnetic
and
cold
and
strong
and
contemptuous
when
its
owner
says
my
curse
upon
you
when
its
owner
s
eyes
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
the
voice
brings
a
miserable
anguished
feeling
to
the
throats
of
those
who
sit
listening
every
emotion
that
the
voice
betrays
is
transmitted
to
the
seduced
brains
of
those
who
sit
listening
the
woman
works
her
audience
up
to
some
torturing
pitches
the
while
herself
blandly
and
earning
an
honest
livelihood
by
the
sweat
of
her
brow
forsooth
it
s
always
so
if
all
the
woman
s
scorn
and
anguish
were
real
the
audience
would
sit
unmoved
if
the
woman
s
scorn
and
anguish
were
real
it
would
strike
inward
instead
of
outward
toward
the
audience
and
the
audience
would
not
know
if
the
woman
s
scorn
and
anguish
were
real
it
would
not
seem
real
and
would
be
very
uninteresting
and
that
very
likely
is
the
reason
why
the
scorn
and
anguish
of
other
women
and
of
and
and
and
and
women
who
are
not
working
on
the
stage
is
so
uninteresting
and
ineffectual
it
is
real
and
they
can
not
act
it
out
and
so
it
doesn
t
seem
real
and
you
don
t
have
to
pay
money
to
see
it
done
to
make
it
seem
real
they
must
need
go
at
it
and
work
it
up
and
charge
you
a
round
price
for
it
mary
magdalene
isn
t
here
to
do
this
but
fiske
takes
her
place
and
does
it
for
her
she
does
it
exquisitely
well
could
mary
magdalene
herself
she
of
the
bible
be
among
those
who
sit
watching
she
would
surely
marvel
and
admire
meanwhile
for
myself
i
have
two
visions
of
this
mary
magdalene
one
in
one
of
the
acts
wherein
her
eyes
do
hunger
and
thirst
after
righteousness
when
she
sits
before
a
small
table
and
lifts
her
pathetic
sweet
voice
with
the
words
when
the
dawn
breaks
and
the
darkness
shall
flee
away
and
then
she
stands
and
the
red
hair
is
equally
pathetic
and
twofold
bewitching
and
she
says
again
when
the
dawn
breaks
and
the
darkness
shall
flee
and
the
other
vision
is
of
her
in
the
country
in
the
midst
of
a
summer
day
under
a
summer
sky
swinging
high
and
recklessly
in
a
hammock
xi
like
a
stone
wall
my
friend
annabel
lee
has
told
me
there
are
bitterer
things
in
store
for
me
than
i
have
known
yet
times
i
have
wondered
what
they
can
be
when
you
have
come
to
them
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
they
will
be
so
bitter
and
will
fit
so
well
into
your
life
that
you
will
wonder
that
you
did
not
always
know
about
them
and
you
will
wonder
why
you
did
not
always
have
the
bitterest
things
i
have
known
yet
i
said
have
had
to
do
with
the
varying
friendship
of
one
or
another
whom
i
have
varying
friendship
said
annabel
lee
but
friendship
does
not
no
that
is
true
i
rejoined
i
mean
the
varying
deception
i
have
had
from
some
whom
i
have
in
time
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
you
will
love
more
and
your
deceiving
will
be
all
at
once
and
bitterer
it
will
be
a
rich
why
rich
i
inquired
because
from
it
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
you
will
learn
to
not
see
too
much
to
not
start
out
with
faith
in
fact
to
take
the
goods
that
the
gods
provide
and
endeavor
to
be
thankful
for
them
your
other
experiences
have
been
in
that
respect
they
leave
you
with
rays
of
hope
without
which
you
would
be
better
off
they
are
poor
and
bitter
what
is
to
come
will
be
rich
and
bitterer
their
bitterness
will
prevent
you
from
appreciating
the
richness
of
them
until
perhaps
years
have
come
and
taken
them
from
immediately
before
your
eyes
as
soon
as
they
are
where
you
can
not
see
them
you
can
consider
them
and
appreciate
their
whatever
they
may
be
i
made
answer
i
do
not
think
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
appreciate
their
then
you
will
be
very
ungrateful
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
looked
hard
at
her
and
she
looked
back
at
me
there
are
times
when
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
much
like
a
stone
wall
yes
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
if
you
ever
feel
to
express
proper
gratitude
for
the
good
things
of
this
life
be
sure
that
you
express
your
gratitude
for
the
right
thing
very
likely
you
will
not
have
a
great
deal
of
gratitude
and
you
must
not
waste
any
of
it
but
what
you
do
have
will
be
of
the
most
excellent
quality
for
it
will
accumulate
and
the
accumulation
will
all
go
to
quality
and
the
things
for
which
you
are
to
be
grateful
are
the
bitternesses
you
have
known
if
you
have
had
it
in
mind
ever
to
give
way
to
bursts
of
gratitude
for
this
air
that
comes
from
off
the
salt
sea
for
that
line
of
pearls
and
violets
that
you
see
just
above
the
horizon
for
the
health
of
your
body
for
the
sleep
that
comes
to
you
at
the
close
of
the
day
for
any
of
those
things
then
get
rid
of
the
idea
at
once
those
things
are
quite
well
but
they
are
not
really
given
to
you
they
are
merely
placed
where
any
one
can
reach
them
with
little
effort
the
kind
fates
don
t
care
whether
you
get
them
or
not
their
responsibility
ends
when
they
leave
them
there
but
the
bitternesses
they
give
to
each
person
separately
they
give
you
yours
mary
maclane
for
your
very
own
don
t
say
never
think
of
i
ve
no
intention
of
saying
it
said
i
you
will
find
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
without
noticing
my
interruption
and
with
curious
expressions
in
her
voice
and
upon
her
two
red
lips
you
will
find
that
these
bitternesses
come
from
time
to
time
in
your
life
like
so
many
milestones
they
are
useful
as
such
for
of
course
you
like
to
take
measurements
along
the
road
now
and
again
to
see
what
progress
you
have
made
along
some
parts
of
the
road
you
will
find
your
progress
wonderful
if
you
are
appreciative
and
grateful
at
the
last
milestone
you
have
come
to
thus
far
you
will
express
your
measure
of
gratitude
to
the
kind
fates
that
is
no
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
you
will
not
do
this
the
milestone
but
after
you
have
passed
it
and
have
turned
a
corner
and
so
can
not
see
it
even
when
you
look
but
why
shall
i
express
gratitude
there
i
inquired
in
a
tone
that
must
have
been
rather
lifeless
why
repeated
my
friend
annabel
lee
because
you
will
have
grown
in
strength
on
account
of
these
milestones
because
you
will
have
learned
to
take
all
things
tranquilly
why
after
the
very
last
milestone
i
daresay
you
would
be
able
to
sit
with
folded
hands
if
a
house
were
burning
up
about
your
ears
which
must
indeed
be
a
triumph
said
i
a
triumph
a
victory
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
with
still
more
curious
expressions
and
the
victories
are
not
what
this
world
sees
which
reminded
me
of
things
i
used
to
hear
in
ever
so
many
years
ago
you
remember
the
story
of
the
ten
virgins
taking
the
story
literally
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
the
lot
of
the
five
foolish
virgins
is
much
the
more
fortunate
there
was
a
rare
measure
of
bitterness
for
them
when
they
found
themselves
without
oil
for
their
lamps
at
a
time
when
oil
was
needed
they
gained
infinitely
more
than
they
lost
as
for
the
five
wise
virgins
well
wouldn
t
have
been
one
of
them
under
circumstances
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
fancy
the
miserable
mean
mindless
imaginationless
selfish
natures
that
could
remain
unmoved
by
the
simplicity
of
the
appeal
give
us
of
your
oil
for
our
lamps
are
gone
it
must
now
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
be
a
hundred
times
bitterer
for
them
to
think
of
being
handed
down
in
endless
history
as
demons
of
selfishness
and
they
are
now
where
they
can
not
presumably
measure
their
bitterness
by
milestones
of
so
then
yes
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
whatever
else
you
may
do
as
you
go
through
life
remember
to
save
up
your
gratitude
for
the
bitternesses
you
have
known
and
remember
that
for
the
bitterest
is
yet
to
have
annabel
lee
i
asked
already
known
the
bitterest
that
can
come
and
can
sit
with
your
hands
folded
in
the
midst
of
a
burning
house
not
i
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
laughed
gayly
again
i
looked
hard
at
her
and
she
looked
back
at
me
certainly
there
are
times
when
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
like
a
stone
wall
xii
to
fall
in
love
i
loved
madly
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
there
came
one
down
out
of
the
north
country
that
was
dark
and
strong
and
brave
and
full
of
life
s
fire
all
my
short
life
had
been
bathed
in
summer
i
had
dreamed
my
thirteen
years
beneath
upon
a
high
hill
but
at
the
coming
of
this
man
from
the
north
country
i
opened
my
two
and
the
world
turned
white
exquisite
rapturous
divine
white
and
afterward
all
was
heavy
gray
away
from
the
high
hill
of
the
there
lay
a
stretch
of
red
barren
waste
with
towering
rocks
and
beyond
that
a
quiet
quiet
sea
that
was
only
blue
at
the
left
of
the
high
hill
of
the
there
was
a
mountain
covered
with
green
ivy
dark
green
ivy
that
defined
its
own
green
shape
against
the
brilliant
yellow
sky
behind
it
green
and
yellow
green
and
yellow
green
and
yellow
said
the
sky
and
the
mountain
covered
with
ivy
the
high
hill
of
the
was
colored
with
all
the
colors
of
japan
i
lived
there
with
people
my
mother
and
my
father
and
some
others
all
with
pale
faces
and
but
some
of
them
were
very
ugly
then
came
one
down
out
of
the
north
country
that
was
dark
and
strong
and
brave
and
full
of
life
s
fire
he
was
ugly
but
his
face
was
perfect
straightway
i
fell
in
love
with
this
one
of
all
things
in
japan
what
a
thing
it
is
to
fall
in
love
where
the
red
barren
waste
lay
spread
below
me
i
saw
manifold
softnesses
like
a
dove
s
breast
like
a
fawn
s
eyes
like
melted
lilies
and
the
towering
gloomy
rocks
were
the
home
of
violet
dreams
in
the
deep
green
of
the
ivy
mountain
my
soul
found
rest
at
nightfall
among
mystery
and
shadow
it
wandered
there
in
marvelous
peace
and
the
coolness
and
damp
and
the
low
muttering
of
the
wind
and
the
night
birds
went
into
it
with
a
stirring
powerful
influence
also
the
voices
out
of
the
very
long
ago
came
from
among
the
green
dark
ivy
and
from
the
crevices
of
gray
stones
beneath
it
and
they
told
me
true
things
in
the
stillness
from
the
deepness
of
the
brilliant
yellow
sky
the
yellow
of
burnished
brass
there
came
legion
contradictions
and
wondrous
paradox
and
parallel
that
had
not
been
among
the
appeared
to
me
as
my
mind
contemplated
these
i
said
am
i
thus
in
love
because
that
i
am
weak
or
that
i
am
strong
for
i
see
here
that
it
is
both
weakness
and
strength
and
i
said
am
i
myself
when
i
do
this
thing
or
was
that
i
who
lived
among
the
i
said
who
am
i
what
am
i
below
all
there
was
the
blue
broad
sea
this
sea
gave
out
a
white
mist
that
rose
and
spread
over
the
earth
i
knew
that
i
was
in
love
once
and
for
all
the
world
was
white
the
world
was
beautiful
the
world
was
divine
life
shone
out
of
the
mist
unspeakable
in
its
countless
possibilities
voices
spoke
near
me
and
infinite
voices
called
to
me
from
afar
they
sounded
clear
and
faint
and
and
tender
and
the
soul
of
me
answered
them
with
deafening
joyous
silent
music
he
from
the
north
country
that
was
dark
and
strong
and
brave
and
full
of
life
s
fire
came
some
days
to
the
high
hill
of
the
he
spoke
often
and
of
many
things
he
spoke
to
people
to
my
mother
and
to
my
father
and
to
others
and
rarely
he
spoke
to
me
rarely
he
looked
at
me
he
had
been
in
the
great
world
he
knew
wonderful
women
and
wonderful
men
he
had
been
touched
with
all
things
what
a
human
being
was
he
and
of
all
things
in
japan
what
a
thing
it
is
to
fall
in
love
when
three
days
had
gone
my
heart
knew
rapture
beyond
any
that
it
had
dreamed
it
knew
the
mysteries
and
the
fullnesses
after
three
days
the
world
turned
to
that
divine
white
and
was
white
for
seven
days
and
afterward
all
was
heavy
gray
the
one
from
the
north
country
returned
back
to
the
north
country
of
all
things
in
japan
what
a
thing
it
is
to
fall
in
love
i
was
not
in
love
with
this
one
because
he
was
a
man
or
because
he
was
strange
and
fascinating
but
because
he
was
a
glorious
human
being
my
heart
was
not
turned
to
this
one
to
marry
him
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
are
for
such
as
are
in
love
unconsciously
to
see
this
one
from
the
north
country
to
hear
his
voice
that
was
life
and
all
for
me
life
and
all
but
he
was
gone
he
left
a
silence
and
a
weariness
these
came
and
crowded
out
the
white
from
my
heart
and
themselves
found
lodgment
there
and
all
was
heavy
gray
the
picture
of
life
and
the
mystery
and
shadow
that
was
revealed
to
me
when
the
world
was
white
has
never
gone
it
has
filled
me
in
the
days
of
my
youth
with
an
old
terror
of
all
things
in
japan
what
a
thing
it
is
to
fall
in
love
to
fall
in
love
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
the
while
her
two
eyes
and
her
two
white
hands
in
their
expression
their
position
told
of
a
thing
that
is
to
see
xiii
when
i
went
to
the
butte
high
school
there
was
a
time
i
said
to
my
friend
annabel
lee
when
i
went
to
the
butte
high
school
i
think
of
it
now
with
mingled
you
were
younger
then
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
was
younger
and
in
those
days
i
still
looked
upon
life
as
something
which
would
one
day
open
wide
and
display
wondrous
and
beautiful
things
for
me
and
meanwhile
i
went
every
day
to
the
butte
high
school
i
found
it
a
very
interesting
place
much
more
interesting
than
i
have
since
found
the
broad
world
i
was
sixteen
and
seventeen
and
eighteen
and
things
were
not
brilliantly
colored
and
so
i
made
much
with
a
vivid
fancy
of
all
that
came
in
my
and
what
do
you
now
that
you
are
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
sit
quietly
i
replied
and
wish
not
and
wait
not
and
look
back
upon
the
days
in
the
butte
high
school
with
mingled
also
unawares
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
you
still
think
things
relating
to
that
which
is
one
day
to
open
wondrously
for
you
but
never
mind
she
added
hastily
as
i
was
about
to
say
something
tell
me
about
the
butte
high
twas
a
place
said
i
where
were
gathered
together
manifold
interesting
phenomena
and
where
i
studied
vergil
and
grew
fond
of
it
and
was
good
in
it
and
where
i
studied
geometry
and
was
fond
of
it
and
knew
less
about
it
each
day
that
i
studied
it
and
always
i
studied
closely
the
persons
whom
i
met
daily
in
the
butte
high
school
i
recall
very
clearly
each
member
of
the
class
of
my
memory
conjures
up
for
me
some
quaint
and
fantastic
visions
against
picturesque
backgrounds
that
appeal
to
my
sense
of
delicate
incongruity
especially
so
since
viewed
in
this
light
and
from
this
what
are
some
of
them
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
there
is
one
said
i
of
a
girl
whom
always
in
my
mind
i
called
the
shad
for
that
she
was
so
bland
and
so
flat
and
so
silent
and
she
had
a
bad
habit
of
asking
me
to
write
her
latin
exercises
which
perhaps
was
not
so
much
like
a
shad
as
like
a
person
and
there
is
one
of
a
girl
who
spent
the
long
hours
of
the
day
in
writing
long
long
letters
to
her
love
but
knew
painfully
little
about
the
lessons
in
the
and
there
is
one
of
a
girl
who
brought
to
school
every
day
a
small
flask
of
whiskey
to
cheer
her
benighted
hours
she
was
daily
called
back
and
down
by
the
french
teacher
on
account
of
her
excessively
bad
french
and
life
had
looked
dull
for
her
were
it
not
for
the
flask
s
pungent
contents
there
is
one
of
a
girl
who
sat
across
the
narrow
aisle
from
me
in
the
during
my
last
year
in
school
who
kept
her
desk
neatly
piled
with
the
works
she
called
them
works
of
albert
ross
and
after
she
had
read
them
very
kindly
she
would
lean
over
and
repeat
the
stories
with
quotations
verbatim
for
my
benefit
her
standing
in
her
classes
was
not
brilliant
but
in
albert
ross
she
was
thorough
there
is
one
of
a
clever
pretty
girl
who
was
malicious
exquisitely
malicious
in
all
her
ways
and
deeds
and
seemingly
no
thought
entered
her
head
that
was
not
fraught
with
it
she
was
malicious
in
algebra
malicious
in
literature
malicious
in
ancient
history
malicious
in
physical
culture
malicious
in
the
writing
of
short
themes
and
when
it
so
chanced
that
i
made
a
failure
in
a
recitation
or
was
stupid
she
would
look
up
at
me
and
smile
very
sweetly
and
maliciously
and
there
is
one
of
a
girl
whose
quaint
and
voluble
profanity
haunts
me
still
and
especially
there
is
in
my
memory
a
picture
of
all
these
on
our
graduating
day
receiving
each
a
fine
white
diploma
rolled
up
and
neatly
tied
with
the
class
colors
a
picture
of
these
and
the
others
we
were
in
all
and
the
diplomas
stated
tacitly
in
heavily
engrossed
letters
that
we
had
all
been
good
for
four
years
and
had
fulfilled
every
requirement
of
the
butte
high
school
so
we
had
doubtless
but
how
much
some
of
us
had
done
for
which
in
our
diplomas
we
were
not
given
credit
in
truth
nothing
was
stated
in
them
in
engrossed
lettering
about
courses
in
or
profanity
or
malice
and
albert
ross
was
not
in
the
curriculum
and
the
president
of
the
school
board
doled
out
those
diplomas
with
a
short
set
speech
for
each
one
wet
june
day
but
he
was
not
aware
how
insignificant
they
were
and
my
mind
likewise
conjures
up
a
vision
of
two
with
whom
i
used
to
take
what
we
called
tramps
during
our
last
year
in
the
high
school
far
down
and
out
of
butte
on
saturdays
and
other
days
when
school
was
not
i
remember
those
two
and
those
tramps
exceeding
well
nor
can
i
think
with
but
four
years
gone
that
the
two
themselves
have
forgotten
one
of
these
was
an
individual
whose
like
i
have
not
since
known
she
reminded
me
sometimes
of
cleopatra
and
sometimes
of
peg
of
limmavaddy
she
was
of
irish
ancestry
and
had
a
long
black
mane
of
hair
braided
down
behind
and
two
conscious
and
lurid
eyes
of
the
kind
that
is
known
as
irish
blue
she
had
brains
enough
within
her
head
but
did
not
study
overmuch
her
ways
of
going
through
life
were
often
very
dubious
she
weighed
a
great
many
pounds
her
experience
of
the
world
was
large
and
to
me
she
was
fascinating
for
herself
she
was
always
rather
afraid
of
me
so
much
afraid
in
truth
that
if
i
said
a
funny
thing
she
must
need
laugh
with
a
forced
and
fictitious
merriment
if
i
told
her
she
had
no
soul
she
must
need
agree
with
me
abjectly
though
she
was
a
good
catholic
if
i
frowned
upon
her
she
shivered
and
was
silent
fanciful
names
and
frocks
though
this
lady
s
frocks
were
always
fanciful
in
ways
were
selected
for
these
tramping
expeditions
this
one
s
fanciful
name
was
called
muddled
maud
for
no
particular
reason
i
believe
but
she
wore
it
well
the
other
member
of
our
trio
was
of
a
less
extraordinary
type
she
was
stout
as
to
figure
and
she
knew
a
great
deal
about
some
things
she
was
very
good
in
history
and
at
home
she
could
make
pie
and
cake
and
bread
it
is
true
that
her
cake
sometimes
stuck
and
sometimes
sank
in
the
middle
and
when
she
carved
a
fowl
she
could
not
always
hit
the
joints
and
she
was
one
of
the
kind
that
always
pronounces
picture
she
was
also
known
as
a
very
sensible
girl
i
can
see
her
now
with
a
purple
ribbon
around
her
neck
and
a
brown
on
coming
into
the
high
school
on
a
wet
morning
when
we
went
tramping
she
usually
wore
an
immense
gown
belted
in
at
the
waist
and
a
wide
flat
hat
which
made
her
look
rather
like
a
her
fanciful
name
was
emancipated
eva
emancipated
in
truth
she
was
in
the
high
school
she
was
dignified
and
sedate
but
on
our
tramps
she
would
frequently
skip
like
a
young
lamb
and
frisk
and
gambol
down
there
in
the
country
she
who
was
called
muddled
maud
likewise
frisked
and
gamboled
and
always
she
personified
my
idea
of
the
french
noun
also
i
frisked
and
gamboled
in
those
days
far
down
in
the
country
the
fanciful
name
selected
for
me
was
refreshment
rosanna
and
i
can
not
tell
why
but
it
was
thought
a
good
name
for
a
lady
tramp
we
started
on
these
tramps
at
six
in
the
morning
we
would
rise
from
our
beds
at
five
and
at
ten
minutes
before
six
i
would
meet
muddled
maud
at
the
corner
of
washington
and
quartz
streets
below
her
house
together
we
would
go
down
east
park
street
to
the
home
of
emancipated
eva
then
we
walked
seven
miles
or
eight
away
into
the
open
and
the
wild
we
took
things
along
to
eat
sometimes
a
great
many
things
and
sometimes
a
few
times
muddled
maud
would
have
but
a
and
emancipated
eva
would
come
laden
with
hard
bits
of
beef
and
i
could
show
but
a
plate
of
fudge
but
other
times
there
were
tarts
and
and
turnovers
and
deviled
ham
and
deviled
chicken
and
deviled
veal
and
deviled
tongue
and
deviled
fish
of
divers
kinds
and
some
bottles
of
october
ale
and
sardines
l
and
green
green
olives
only
the
more
there
was
the
harder
to
carry
but
times
muddled
maud
would
carry
much
with
little
effort
she
would
adorn
herself
with
the
luncheon
a
long
bit
of
about
her
neck
like
a
chain
and
upon
her
hat
held
securely
with
fat
yellow
lemons
and
two
bananas
crossed
in
front
like
the
tiny
guns
on
a
soldier
s
hat
and
bunches
of
catawba
grapes
scattered
here
and
there
and
pears
hanging
by
their
little
stems
behind
the
too
early
morning
prevented
all
from
being
seen
by
the
inhabitants
of
butte
and
we
did
not
venture
home
again
until
came
the
friendly
darkness
those
were
fascinating
expeditions
and
whose
was
the
glory
mine
was
the
glory
twas
i
who
invented
them
twas
i
who
knew
there
was
none
so
fitted
for
a
so
delicate
absurdity
as
she
we
called
muddled
maud
and
after
her
none
so
fitted
as
the
fair
the
the
emancipated
and
together
with
them
both
i
and
i
led
them
forth
and
i
led
them
back
and
i
said
things
should
be
thus
and
so
and
straightway
they
were
thus
and
so
and
we
enjoyed
it
and
clear
air
was
in
our
lungs
and
life
was
in
our
veins
for
we
had
each
but
eighteen
years
and
were
full
of
youth
but
most
of
all
twas
fascinating
because
we
were
three
of
three
widely
differing
manners
of
living
and
methods
of
reasoning
for
i
was
not
like
emancipated
eva
nor
yet
like
muddled
maud
and
emancipated
eva
was
not
like
me
nor
yet
like
muddled
maud
and
muddled
maud
was
not
like
emancipated
eva
nor
yet
like
me
to
be
sure
there
were
some
things
in
my
ordering
which
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
found
enchanting
why
should
the
maclane
do
all
the
ordering
they
murmured
between
themselves
but
they
dared
not
openly
revolt
so
all
went
well
but
now
these
are
gone
the
three
of
us
were
graduated
from
the
butte
high
school
with
the
others
of
and
had
each
a
fine
white
diploma
and
went
our
ways
she
who
was
like
cleopatra
and
peg
of
limmavaddy
is
teaching
a
school
according
to
the
last
that
i
heard
in
the
north
of
montana
and
she
that
was
emancipated
eva
has
long
since
gone
to
california
and
is
married
and
keeps
a
house
and
for
me
i
am
here
far
off
from
butte
with
you
annabel
lee
some
things
having
been
done
meanwhile
but
though
the
two
are
gone
i
warrant
they
have
not
forgotten
they
have
not
forgotten
the
butte
high
school
nor
the
class
of
nor
the
tramps
we
went
nor
their
tyrant
me
and
i
daresay
they
all
remember
their
butte
high
school
she
of
the
she
of
the
she
the
student
of
albert
ross
she
of
the
profanity
she
of
the
malice
the
shad
and
all
the
the
young
feminine
persons
and
the
young
masculine
persons
some
are
married
and
some
are
flown
and
some
of
them
are
grown
up
and
different
and
some
of
them
in
the
churchyard
lie
and
some
are
gone
to
but
whenever
i
ve
a
fancy
to
shut
my
eyes
and
look
back
i
can
see
them
all
a
quaint
company
also
whenever
i
ve
a
fancy
to
shut
my
eyes
and
look
back
to
life
when
it
was
unspeakably
brilliant
in
possibilities
to
look
forward
to
and
was
marked
in
checks
and
rings
it
fetches
me
to
the
days
when
i
went
to
the
butte
high
school
and
studied
geometry
and
vergil
only
i
m
glad
i
m
not
there
what
for
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
it
is
rather
pitiful
and
dreadful
to
think
of
having
been
seventeen
and
to
have
gone
every
day
to
the
butte
high
school
and
imagined
how
life
would
be
some
day
said
i
and
all
at
once
felt
very
weary
xiv
and
mary
maclane
and
me
there
are
times
in
a
number
of
days
when
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
i
enjoy
a
cigarette
together
my
friend
annabel
lee
with
her
cigarette
her
petite
form
wrapped
round
in
clouds
of
thin
exquisite
gray
is
more
than
all
suggestive
and
inscrutable
she
leans
her
two
elbows
on
something
and
looks
out
at
me
i
with
my
cigarette
am
nothing
but
i
with
my
cigarette
i
enjoy
it
but
am
not
beautiful
with
it
nor
fascinating
but
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
all
that
my
imagination
can
take
in
under
the
influence
of
the
thin
exquisite
gray
she
grows
fanciful
and
subtly
and
indefinitely
she
meets
me
somewhere
and
extends
me
her
hand
for
a
moment
don
t
you
know
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
with
her
cigarette
that
old
song
that
goes
mary
seaton
and
mary
beaton
and
mary
carmichael
and
me
i
think
it
is
mary
stuart
of
scotland
who
says
that
and
a
fair
good
song
it
is
but
just
now
for
if
i
were
mary
stuart
of
scotland
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
i
should
say
mary
maclane
and
mary
maclane
and
mary
maclane
and
for
aren
t
we
two
together
here
calmly
smoking
and
doesn
t
the
world
spin
round
i
was
enchanted
how
few
are
the
times
when
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
like
this
warm
and
friendly
and
lightly
contemptuous
and
inclined
to
grotesquerie
tis
so
that
she
becomes
human
and
someway
near
to
me
yes
i
should
say
mary
maclane
and
mary
maclane
and
mary
maclane
and
me
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
from
her
clouds
there
are
times
when
you
are
soft
and
satisfying
as
a
gray
if
i
stroke
you
you
will
purr
if
i
give
you
cream
you
will
lap
it
up
and
then
you
will
curl
up
warmly
in
my
lap
and
sleep
and
purr
and
open
and
shut
your
little
fur
paws
i
will
sit
by
the
fire
and
give
her
some
food
and
pussy
will
love
me
because
i
am
what
literature
is
more
literature
than
mother
goose
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
will
you
love
me
because
i
am
good
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
you
must
love
what
is
good
and
because
it
is
good
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
and
that
you
must
hate
what
is
evil
look
at
me
look
at
me
am
i
good
i
looked
at
her
certainly
she
was
good
just
then
she
had
a
look
of
angels
do
you
love
me
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
with
her
cigarette
oh
yes
said
i
look
at
me
again
am
i
evil
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
presume
you
are
i
replied
for
then
she
looked
vindictive
and
vicious
and
do
you
hate
me
no
said
i
then
you
are
very
bad
and
wicked
yourself
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
with
her
cigarette
and
the
world
and
all
good
people
will
condemn
i
fear
said
i
with
my
cigarette
that
the
world
and
all
good
people
already
do
ah
do
they
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
never
mind
i
will
take
care
of
you
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
i
will
make
all
soft
for
you
i
will
keep
out
the
cold
i
will
color
the
dullness
i
will
fight
off
the
and
i
i
replied
if
for
that
reason
you
do
so
will
thank
the
world
and
all
good
people
for
condemning
that
was
neatly
said
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
but
let
me
tell
you
when
the
world
grows
soft
i
will
grow
hard
hard
as
then
let
the
world
stay
hard
i
said
hard
and
bitter
as
wormwood
if
it
will
so
that
you
come
indeed
thus
friendly
to
me
through
these
gray
that
too
was
very
neat
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
but
mostly
it
goes
to
show
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
what
literature
is
more
literature
than
the
proverbs
what
is
a
bird
in
the
hand
worth

second
in

first
in

little
iberian
village

but
i

whether
it

not
said
my

annabel
lee
some
day
you
and
i
will
go
out
into
the
great
broad
world
then
we
shall
see
who
will
be
first
and
who
will
be
second
the
great
broad
world
is
the
best
place
of
all
wherein
to
find
ourselves
and
no
matter
how
we
were
situated
before
we
shall
certainly
be
situated
differently
in
the
great
broad
world
in
the
great
broad
world
there
will
be
apples
apples
enough
for
you
and
for
me
but
who
knows
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
it
may
be
that
your
lot
will
be
the
sweet
juicy
apples
whilst
i
shall
be
given
the
cores
in
the
great
broad
world
there
will
be
shortcake
enough
for
you
and
for
me
but
who
knows
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
it
may
be
that
your
lot
will
be
all
the
ripe
red
raspberries
whilst

shall
be
given
the
crusts
in
the
great
broad

there
will

cigarettes
cigarettes
enough
for
you

for
me
but
who
knows
you
poor
miserable
little
rat
it
may
be
that
your
lot
will
be
the
fine
egyptian
tobacco
and
rice
paper
and
clouds
and
clouds
and
clouds
of
pearl
gray
soft
pearl
gray
to
wrap
you
round
whilst
i
shall
go
looking
in
empty
boxes
all
day
long
and
never
a
cigarette
in
which
case
mine
will
be
by
far
the
better
lot
in
the
end
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
according
to
the
law
of
oh
dear
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
petulantly
why
do
you
sit
there
stupidly
staring
talk
and
amuse
me
why
don
t
you
make
me
feel
sweet
and
if
i
were
but
that
myself
annabel
lee
said
i
i
can
not
talk
interestingly
but
if
you
like
i
will
ask
you
the
proverbs
and
you
may
answer
them
that
amused
me
much
and
it
gave
me
a
wonderful
feeling
of
satisfaction
quite
as
if
i
were
seven
years
old
and
knew
my
lesson
you
ask
and
i
answer
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
very
good
but
i
don
t
know
my

red

romance
you
with

no
not
particularly
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
rather
like
looks
she
added
and
her
purple
eyes
became
less
vague
sitting
there
in
your
small
black
frock
and
you
puff
at
that
tobacco
much
like
a
toy
engine
come
you
amuse
me
you
please
me
come
near
she
held
out
one
of
her
hands
and
the
purple
eyes
changed
suddenly
into
something
that
was
rarely
and
indescribably
friendly
i
felt
much
from
life
my
friend
annabel
lee
rested
the
hand
she
had
held
out
upon
my
shoulder
when
we
go
into
the
great
broad
world
mary
maclane
she
said
and
you
have
all
the
apples
and
all
the
shortcake
and
all
the
cigarettes
then
perhaps
will
you
them
with
me
i
said
i
would
xv
a
story
of
when
the
mood
takes
my
friend
annabel
lee
she
will
if
i
beg
her
tell
me
quaint
and
fantastic
stories
such
as
are
hidden
away
in
the
dusty
crevices
of
this
world
these
tales
have
lain
away
there
for
centuries
and
spiders
have
spun
webs
over
and
about
them
so
that
when
perchance
they
are
brought
out
bits
of
fine
gray
fiber
are
to
be
found
among
the
lines
yesterday
a
pretty
plain
story
by
my
friend
annabel
lee
that
runs
through
my
mind
long
ago
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
there
lived
in
egypt
a
family
of
but
in
a
green
marsh
by
the
side
of
the
great
green
river
nile
this
family
numbered
five
and
they
were
united
and
dwelling
in
peace
there
were
the
father
and
mother
and
two
daughters
and
a
son
and
there
had
been
another
son
but
he
was
dead
and
their
names
were
maren
the
mother
and
oliver
the
father
and
lilith
the
elder
daughter
and
delilah
the
younger
daughter
and
the
son
s
name
was
le
page
the
son
who
had
died
was
named
roland
he
was
buried
at
the
edge
of
the
marsh
and
his
name
and
the
date
were
carved
upon
a
square
black
wooden
tablet
to
his
memory
at
the
head
of
the
grave
there
was
also
this
legend
upon
the
tablet
age
gone
in
the
of
youth
to
his
last
rest
but
his
virtues
are
with
us
and
little
delilah
who
was
an
elementary
fanciful
child
of
nine
used
to
stand
staring
at
this
legend
and
wondering
about
it
a
weeping
willow
hung
low
over
the
grave
and
delilah
would
stand
near
it
picking
gnats
from
its
branches
with
her
bill
and
speculating
about
the
legend
she
wondered
for
one
thing
what
meant
was
it
anything
like
a
or
was
it
on
the
contrary
a
day
when
everything
went
wrong
and
ended
by
a
person
s
being
shut
into
a
dark
or
was
it
perhaps
a
picnic
day
with
tarts
made
of
red
jam
in
that
case
delilah
felt
very
sorry
for
her
brother
that
he
should
have
died
on
such
a
day
for
if
there
is
an
article
of
diet
that
really
like
it
is
tarts
of
red
jam
made
the
way
canadians
make
them
but
she
never
could
decide
and
another
thing
about
the
epitaph
that
puzzled
her
was
the
concluding
clause
but
his
virtues
are
with
us
what
could
virtues
be
she
asked
herself
were
they
anything
like
feathers
or
were
they
good
to
eat
or
were
they
something
she
had
never
seen
and
knew
nothing
about
but
the
letters
said
plainly
his
virtues
are
with
us
truly
if
they
were
among
the
family
possessions
why
had
she
not
seen
them
for
anything
that
belonged
to
any
of
the
family
that
was
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
was
always
placed
in
an
oak
cabinet
with
glass
doors
that
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
in
their
marsh
home
delilah
had
often
looked
in
this
cabinet
to
see
if
the
virtues
of
her
brother
were
not
there
there
were
dried
snake
skins
and
curious
white
stones
and
spanish
moss
and
devil
s
but
no
there
were
no
virtues
of
that
she
was
convinced
she
appealed
to
her
older
sister
lilith
said
delilah
what
virtues
and
where
do
we
keep
roland
s
don
t
you
know
on
the
tombstone
it
says
his
virtues
are
with
us
aren
t
you
a
silly
said
lilith
laughing
in
derision
lilith
was
twelve
and
one
knows
vastly
more
at
twelve
than
at
nine
virtues
aren
t
anything
and
as
for
roland
s
that
doesn
t
mean
that
he
left
them
with
us
any
more
than
that
he
took
them
with
then
what
it
mean
said
delilah
i
ve
thought
so
much
about
you
ll
have
to
think
some
more
said
lilith
a
good
deal
more
i
should
say
of
kind
of
thinking
delilah
did
not
often
appeal
to
her
sister
in
these
matters
she
did
not
enjoy
lilith
s
habit
of
laughing
in
truth
she
didn
t
enjoy
being
laughed
at
at
all
not
the
least
in
the
world
she
was
like
a
great
many
other
people
and
so
was
lilith
but
oh
there
were
many
things
that
delilah
wished
to
know
the
family
was
as
i
have
said
well
born
but
poorly
bred
maren
and
oliver
both
came
of
very
good
stock
but
they
had
been
the
black
sheep
of
their
families
and
had
forgotten
the
traditions
and
customs
of
their
race
they
had
left
no
more
pride
maren
s
mother
once
said
than
a
crane
no
nor
a
no
nor
a
duck
echoed
maren
and
her
husband
and
gloried
in
it
and
the
children
ran
wild
but
the
children
though
they
ran
wild
were
not
without
ambition
on
summer
evenings
when
the
family
took
tea
on
the
back
porch
and
it
was
too
warm
for
the
children
to
run
about
much
they
used
to
sit
and
tell
their
ambitions
i
m
going
to
be
an
actress
when
get
big
declared
lilith
i
m
going
to
have
a
splendid
career
on
the
stage
and
i
shall
earn
heaps
of
money
and
i
shall
have
magnificent
clothes
and
every
one
will
look
at
me
and
say
she
in
stunning
form
and
le
page
and
delilah
were
so
overcome
by
the
vision
thus
presented
of
their
sister
that
they
could
but
stare
awed
and
silent
and
delilah
wondered
how
it
must
seem
to
be
so
very
clever
but
le
page
who
was
eleven
years
old
himself
soon
rallied
well
then
said
he
when
get
big
i
m
going
to
be
a
pirate
i
ll
lay
over
all
the
pirates
that
ever
were
and
and
i
ll
wear
magnificent
clothes
and
everyone
will
look
at
me
and
say
he
in
stunning
form
delilah
thought
this
latter
sounded
strangely
like
lilith
but
perhaps
in
some
subtle
way
a
pirate
was
like
an
actress
and
so
must
need
be
described
in
the
same
terms
and
delilah
said
her
father
what
shall
you
be
what
kind
of
clothes
are
you
going
to
wear
delilah
had
before
tried
the
experiment
of
relating
her
ambition
to
the
assembled
family
and
the
result
had
been
bad
the
high
laughter
of
lilith
and
le
page
always
rose
on
the
still
evening
air
and
even
her
father
who
was
a
kind
person
would
smile
delilah
s
ambition
was
always
the
same
but
she
nearly
always
varied
it
a
little
at
each
telling
and
the
amusement
evinced
by
her
sister
and
brother
varied
accordingly
sometimes
they
even
flapped
their
wings
which
was
too
cruel
forsooth
children
are
always
cruel
but
while
delilah
s
ambition
was
always
the
same
those
of
lilith
and
le
page
covered
an
exceeding
wide
range
some
evenings
lilith
would
draw
a
glowing
picture
of
herself
as
a
lecturer
of
renown
with
a
wonderful
personal
magnetism
and
a
telling
style
she
would
move
the
multitudes
and
draw
tears
from
stony
eyes
by
lifting
up
her
voice
whereupon
le
page
when
he
had
recovered
his
breath
would
portray
himself
as
a
celebrated
scientist
delving
in
marvelous
chemical
mysteries
and
discovering
things
of
untold
benefit
to
the
race
he
also
would
move
the
multitudes
and
draw
tears
from
stony
eyes
and
delilah
would
wonder
what
were
lecturers
and
scientists
and
how
they
could
do
these
things
and
when
lilith
would
announce
her
intention
of
becoming
a
famous
sculptor
whose
work
in
the
passionate
would
be
the
delight
of
her
day
then
le
page
would
turn
his
mind
to
the
idea
of
becoming
a
noted
explorer
who
would
penetrate
into
darkest
africa
and
farthest
north
and
whose
work
in
the
passionate
would
be
the
delight
of
his
day
and
delilah
would
marvel
still
more
forsooth
children
are
always
like
that
and
fascinating
they
are
and
each
summer
evening
after
lilith
and
le
page
had
related
their
ambitions
their
father
would
ask
delilah
what
was
hers
then
always
delilah
would
whisper
i
m
going
to
study
tombstones
papa
and
when
i
get
big
perhaps
i
shall
know
what
every
single
tombstone
in
the
world
means
and
perhaps
after
i
ve
studied
a
long
time
and
hard
i
can
read
roland
s
right
off
and
know
what
it
means
without
thinking
and
perhaps
i
can
explain
them
all
to
people
who
don
t
know
about
which
to
delilah
was
a
daring
ambition
indeed
quite
hitching
her
wagon
to
a
star
well
then
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
this
was
when
the
family
was
in
its
youngness
the
years
followed
one
after
another
and
the
three
children
grew
and
it
came
about
that
lilith
was
and
le
page
was
and
delilah
was
twenty
they
were
much
as
they
had
been
when
they
were
children
lilith
i
may
say
in
passing
was
not
an
actress
nor
a
lecturer
nor
yet
a
sculptor
and
le
page
was
merely
le
page
also
delilah
was
delilah
but
had
ceased
to
be
elementary
in
some
ways
while
in
others
she
was
still
and
so
would
be
until
the
finish
it
so
happened
that
a
young
of
masculine
persuasion
from
the
other
side
of
the
great
green
river
nile
fell
in
love
with
delilah
likewise
delilah
fell
in
love
with
a
young
but
not
that
young
it
happens
frequently
so
and
delilah
did
not
fancy
the
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
the
with
whom
delilah
was
in
love
did
not
fancy
her
in
just
that
way
which
also
happens
frequently
on
a
day
when
the
river
nile
was
very
green
and
heavy
flowers
of
dead
white
color
hung
from
black
trees
on
the
banks
and
the
sky
was
oh
so
blue
and
all
was
summer
the
young
from
over
the
river
would
come
to
see
delilah
he
loved
so
well
so
hopelessly
that
young
but
delilah
on
such
a
day
would
walk
where
the
green
water
was
shallow
and
her
thoughts
would
be
with
the
young
who
had
gone
to
her
heart
and
the
young
from
over
the
river
would
come
and
stand
a
little
way
from
delilah
under
a
tree
with
broad
thick
leaves
how
fine
was
he
to
look
upon
with
his
white
feathers
glistening
like
silver
and
his
eyes
of
topaz
and
delilah
was
most
adorable
with
feathers
of
soft
soft
gray
a
so
soft
gray
that
one
if
one
were
human
would
wish
to
rest
one
s
forehead
upon
the
fluffy
down
of
her
breast
then
he
from
over
the
river
his
name
was
gerald
would
say
delilah
come
with
me
over
the
river
to
the
damp
meadows
where
there
is
a
pool
with
a
thousand
and
fair
blooms
the
way
we
should
be
happy
there
you
and
but
delilah
would
say
oh
go
back
over
the
river
gerald
you
and
i
never
should
be
happy
together
why
do
you
stand
there
by
the
day
after
day
and
why
do
you
waste
your
and
your
why
are
you
not
giving
your
good
heart
to
some
one
who
can
take
it
but
you
would
be
happy
with
me
delilah
he
under
the
dark
leaves
would
answer
her
eagerly
we
will
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
new
day
and
watch
the
sun
come
up
out
of
the
sand
we
will
stand
in
pale
shallows
at
midday
we
will
feel
our
hearts
beat
high
when
the
lightnings
come
down
through
branches
we
will
fly
a
little
in
high
winds
we
will
stand
still
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
golden
solitudes
when
the
sun
is
going
off
the
sand
and
in
all
these
things
my
heart
will
be
go
back
over
the
river
gerald
said
delilah
but
gerald
felt
that
he
loved
so
well
that
he
could
not
go
back
over
the
river
tis
not
possible
to
go
back
over
the
river
when
one
s
is
standing
by
herself
in
green
shallows
then
along
the
bank
from
the
direction
of
the
date
palms
came
auden
he
who
had
gone
to
delilah
s
heart
likewise
he
was
good
to
see
not
from
the
handsomeness
of
his
feathers
or
his
eyes
but
from
the
strength
of
his
physical
being
though
too
his
eyes
were
of
amethyst
auden
went
along
parallel
to
the
shore
of
the
river
until
he
saw
delilah
standing
in
the
pale
green
water
then
he
crossed
over
and
came
toward
her
there
are
lotus
flowers
blooming
down
below
where
the
steep
cataract
breaks
over
stones
said
he
delilah
will
you
come
with
me
to
eat
some
oh
yes
i
will
come
said
delilah
eagerly
for
she
still
was
elementary
enough
to
say
things
eagerly
so
they
went
down
to
where
the
grew
where
the
steep
cataract
broke
over
stones
it
so
happened
that
it
was
almost
the
time
when
the
great
green
river
nile
flows
out
over
its
banks
and
makes
all
wet
with
water
for
miles
around
at
such
a
time
it
was
the
custom
of
and
cranes
and
and
others
of
their
ilk
and
animals
of
divers
kinds
to
leave
their
homes
and
move
away
out
of
reach
of
the
green
and
purple
flood
but
no
one
had
thought
of
moving
yet
for
it
was
too
early
in
the
season
maren
and
oliver
had
not
even
begun
to
gather
up
their
household
goods
nor
had
they
as
their
wont
was
removed
the
black
tablet
from
the
head
of
roland
s
grave
which
was
on
the
very
edge
of
the
river
the
is
a
person
of
whims
like
the
rest
of
us
and
so
that
year
on
the
day
that
delilah
and
auden
went
down
the
river
to
eat
lotus
flowers
he
gave
vent
to
one
of
them
he
thought
to
send
a
premonition
of
the
yearly
flood
in
the
shape
of
one
beautiful
green
and
purple
and
white
wave
one
which
would
not
go
so
very
far
but
which
should
be
damaging
in
its
effects
delilah
said
auden
since
we
are
here
eating
lotus
flowers
life
is
very
fine
isn
t
it
oh
very
fine
yes
very
fine
said
delilah
and
was
thrilled
you
are
a
so
dear
friend
said
auden
yes
said
delilah
and
was
not
thrilled
life
said
auden
is
pretty
fine
no
matter
how
it
is
but
life
is
a
very
strange
thing
said
delilah
i
can
t
begin
to
tell
you
how
strange
i
have
found
it
for
one
thing
i
may
have
what
is
not
my
heart
s
desire
and
what
is
my
heart
s
desire
i
may
not
it
is
strange
admitted
auden
but
why
have
any
heart
s
desires
aside
from
what
is
already
yours
in
this
fine
fair
world
one
can
not
rule
one
s
heart
cried
delilah
one
s
heart
goes
on
before
one
s
mind
can
stop
to
think
one
s
heart
rushes
in
before
everything
one
s
heart
plays
with
things
when
all
else
is
one
s
heart
loves
but
delilah
never
finished
before
their
eyes
rose
up
a
magnificent
wall
a
wall
of
water
that
was
fire
and
cloud
and
silver
and
in
it
were
ineffable
rainbows
of
the
purple
that
gathers
up
the
soul
in
its
brilliance
and
shows
it
wondrous
possibilities
and
in
it
were
lines
of
the
pale
lavender
that
caresses
the
senses
and
one
breathes
from
it
almost
a
fragrance
of
heliotrope
and
in
it
were
broad
sheets
of
deep
black
and
dazzling
white
that
were
of
the
seeming
of
life
and
death
and
in
it
last
of
all
was
a
world
of
infinite
green
it
had
come
from
a
place
of
great
things
it
had
come
to
a
place
where
all
went
down
before
it
where
lives
exulted
but
shrank
from
it
because
of
its
green
an
exquisite
whim
was
that
of
the
delilah
and
auden
gazed
for
a
brief
moment
they
saw
the
magnificent
things
they
saw
death
in
the
brilliancies
but
nevertheless
their
spirits
rose
high
they
saw
also
a
wild
flight
of
live
things
before
the
wave
delilah
beheld
her
family
lilith
and
the
rest
struggling
and
with
water
and
their
home
made
of
reeds
was
loosed
from
its
foundations
and
borne
down
the
river
presently
the
flood
overtook
themselves
and
the
life
of
delilah
was
merged
in
water
she
was
borne
high
on
a
dark
swell
and
at
the
turning
was
suddenly
struck
a
stunning
blow
upon
the
gray
of
her
breast
by
a
square
black
wooden
tablet
before
death
came
to
her
out
of
the
brilliancies
she
was
conscious
of
several
things
she
saw
before
her
eyes
for
an
instant
with
startling
plainness
the
words
on
the
tablet
gone
in
the
of
youth
to
his
last
rest
but
his
virtues
are
with
us
she
even
fancied
for
the
first
time
that
she
knew
what
it
meant
the
of
youth
she
murmured
to
herself
is
the
day
i
go
to
eat
lotus
flowers
with
my
and
virtues
are
two
eyes
of
amethyst
that
are
with
me
still
as
i
am
auden
was
drowning
together
with
that
s
all
of
the
story
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
thank
you
said
i
it
is
lovely
in
its
quaintness
what
does
it
mean
annabel
lee
mean
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
didn
t
say
it
meant
but
i
suppose
said
i
everything
that
s
true
means
very
likely
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
but
this
story
isn
t
true
i
made
it
because
it
isn
t
true
or
for
some
other
reason
the
story
still
runs
in
my
head
how
like
my
friend
annabel
lee
it
is
xvi
a
measure
of
sorrow
but
though
you
are
equally
as
beautiful
as
poe
s
annabel
lee
i
said
to
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
half
the
time
i
think
you
are
the
same
one
still
when
i
read
over
the
poem
in
my
mind
i
find
you
find
differences
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
repeated
it
was
many
and
many
a
year
ago
in
a
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
a
maiden
there
lived
whom
you
may
know
by
the
name
of
annabel
lee
and
this
maiden
she
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
the
first
four
lines
said
i
do
very
well
for
it
doesn
t
matter
how
long
ago
you
lived
and
who
can
tell
but
i
fancy
you
live
with
other
thoughts
than
that
i
fancy
i
do
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
repeated
i
was
a
child
and
she
was
a
child
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
and
we
loved
with
a
love
that
was
more
than
love
i
and
my
annabel
lee
a
love
that
the
wingèd
seraphs
in
heaven
coveted
her
and
the
first
line
might
stand
said
i
for
you
are
only
fourteen
and
i
but
which
is
quite
young
youth
when
compared
to
the
age
of
the
earth
but
the
third
and
fourth
lines
are
appalling
and
alas
you
are
not
my
annabel
lee
always
you
make
me
feel
indeed
that
nothing
is
mine
and
no
surely
the
winged
seraphs
in
heaven
do
not
envy
you
and
me
for
if
they
do
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
then
heaven
must
needs
be
very
poorly
i
repeated
and
this
was
the
reason
that
long
ago
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
a
wind
blew
out
of
a
cloud
chilling
my
beautiful
annabel
lee
so
that
her
kinsman
came
and
bore
her
away
from
me
to
shut
her
up
in
a
sepulcher
in
this
kingdom
by
the
i
imagine
times
said
i
that
a
chill
wind
has
sometime
come
out
of
a
cloud
by
night
and
gone
over
you
no
kinsman
comes
to
carry
you
away
but
i
shiver
at
the
possibility
will
a
kinsman
come
to
carry
you
away
shall
you
be
shut
into
a
gray
stone
sepulcher
no
kinsman
is
coming
to
carry
me
away
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
kinsmen
do
not
carry
away
things
that
have
no
intrinsic
no
i
believe
they
don
t
said
i
and
felt
relieved
i
repeated
the
angels
not
half
so
happy
in
heaven
went
envying
her
and
me
yes
that
was
the
reason
as
all
men
know
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
the
wind
came
out
of
the
cloud
by
night
chilling
and
killing
my
annabel
but
no
said
i
the
angels
in
heaven
are
surely
more
than
half
so
happy
as
you
and
more
than
half
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
they
need
not
send
clouds
from
heaven
on
that
i
repeated
but
our
love
it
was
stronger
by
far
than
the
love
of
those
who
were
older
than
we
of
many
far
wiser
than
we
and
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
above
nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea
can
ever
dissever
my
soul
from
the
soul
of
the
beautiful
annabel
if
you
loved
anything
said
i
twould
be
stronger
by
far
than
that
of
some
who
are
older
and
of
very
many
who
may
be
i
don
t
think
wisdom
and
age
have
to
do
with
it
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
the
angels
in
heaven
would
count
for
very
little
in
it
said
i
no
certainly
not
the
angels
in
heaven
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea
i
asked
i
don
t
know
about
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
repeated
for
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
me
dreams
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
the
stars
never
rise
but
i
feel
the
bright
eyes
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
so
all
the
i
lie
down
by
the
side
of
my
darling
my
darling
my
life
and
my
bride
in
her
sepulcher
there
by
the
sea
in
her
tomb
by
the
sounding
the
first
lines
said
i
are
for
you
are
like
to
the
moon
and
stars
and
they
are
like
to
you
you
are
with
them
in
the
and
if
you
were
out
by
the
sea
in
a
gray
stone
sepulcher
i
should
stay
there
near
you
in
the
and
the
you
would
be
there
and
my
heart
would
set
in
your
direction
more
than
it
had
set
before
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
for
everything
escheats
to
the
sea
at
last
those
persons
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
who
have
measures
of
sorrow
which
can
be
joined
with
the
sea
are
the
most
fortunate
persons
of
all
those
measures
of
sorrow
will
serve
them
well
and
will
stand
them
in
good
stead
on
days
when
all
other
things
desert
them
if
a
measure
of
sorrow
is
joined
with
the
sea
it
belongs
to
the
sea
and
the
sea
is
always
there
the
sea
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
like
a
letter
from
some
one
whom
you
have
written
to
after
a
long
silence
who
you
thought
might
be
dead
the
sea
is
the
measure
of
sorrow
and
the
measure
of
sorrow
is
the
sea
having
once
had
a
measure
of
sorrow
joined
with
the
sea
your
measure
of
sorrow
will
never
be
separated
from
the
sea
the
measure
of
sorrow
will
sink
all
of
its
woe
deep
into
the
sea
and
the
sea
will
be
of
the
same
color
with
it
for
a
measure
of
sorrow
is
sufficient
to
color
a
great
sea
the
sea
will
give
to
the
measure
of
sorrow
a
bit
of
wild
joy
there
is
no
joy
in
the
world
like
that
of
the
sea
for
there
is
enough
in
it
to
come
out
and
touch
all
things
in
life
and
life
itself
and
the
wild
joy
will
stop
short
only
of
a
scene
of
death
if
a
life
is
joined
with
the
sea
in
spite
of
all
the
weariness
all
the
anguish
all
the
of
unrest
and
all
the
futile
struggling
and
wasting
of
nerves
there
will
yet
be
a
wild
joy
in
it
all
and
thrill
after
thrill
of
triumph
in
extreme
moments
those
measures
of
sorrow
that
are
not
joined
with
the
sea
must
do
for
themselves
and
for
these
reasons
those
persons
who
have
measures
of
sorrow
that
can
be
joined
with
the
sea
are
the
most
fortunate
persons
of
xvii
a
lute
with
no
strings
the
most
astonishing
thing
about
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
that
young
as
she
is
she
seems
except
for
some
thing
in
the
past
to
be
absolutely
in
the
present
she
does
not
build
up
for
herself
things
in
the
future
the
future
is
a
thing
she
looks
upon
with
contempt
she
has
not
a
use
for
it
except
perhaps
to
help
form
a
bitter
sentence
of
words
the
present
she
finds
before
her
and
she
lifts
it
up
and
places
it
upon
a
table
before
her
and
opens
it
as
if
it
were
a
book
a
book
with
but
two
pages
she
seems
to
find
symbols
and
figures
and
faint
suggestions
upon
these
two
pages
from
which
she
derives
a
multitude
of
ideas
and
fancies
and
material
to
make
bitter
sentences
of
words
it
seems
to
interest
her
and
it
interests
me
to
rare
degrees
she
dwells
upon
the
present
she
talks
of
things
in
the
present
with
inflections
of
voice
that
are
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
sentiments
she
utters
the
while
the
expression
of
her
face
is
inscrutable
taken
by
and
large
she
is
an
inscrutable
person
i
wonder
while
i
listen
does
she
herself
believe
these
things
or
is
she
talking
to
amuse
herself
but
perforce
i
feel
a
vein
of
truth
in
each
thing
that
she
says
i
look
hard
at
her
to
discover
signs
of
irony
or
insincerity
but
i
can
but
feel
a
vein
of
rancorous
truth
or
a
vein
of
friendly
truth
or
a
vein
of
ancient
truth
or
curious
then
as
she
is
talking
and
in
the
same
moment
i
am
wondering
i
consider
what
matters
it
whether
or
not
any
of
it
is
true
or
whether
or
not
she
believes
it
or
whether
or
not
i
can
understand
it
since
is
saying
it
is
she
not
an
exquisite
person
telling
me
these
things
in
her
exquisite
voice
she
carries
all
before
her
in
the
world
for
she
and
i
make
up
a
small
world
if
she
be
not
brilliant
in
her
talking
then
that
is
because
that
set
of
sentences
would
be
ruined
by
brilliancy
if
she
be
not
profound
in
her
discoursing
then
that
is
because
her
fancy
at
the
time
dwells
in
the
light
fantastic
and
would
be
ruined
by
profoundness
if
she
be
not
logical
that
is
because
she
is
exquisite
which
is
quite
beyond
logic
nevertheless
when
she
says
what
is
simple
and
plain
and
stupid
the
look
of
her
face
is
more
than
all
the
look
of
one
saying
brilliant
things
and
when
she
touches
lightly
upon
one
thin
fancy
and
another
the
look
of
her
lily
face
is
above
all
things
profound
and
when
her
mood
and
its
expression
are
most
reckless
of
logic
the
look
of
her
face
is
the
model
of
one
giving
out
platitudes
in
all
open
candor
and
reasonableness
i
have
been
led
by
these
looks
of
her
face
to
see
some
varying
visions
of
my
friend
annabel
lee
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
a
capable
elderly
maiden
aunt
one
who
stands
ready
in
sickness
and
in
health
to
do
for
me
and
cooks
little
meat
pies
for
me
and
tells
me
when
i
m
spending
too
much
money
and
what
to
do
for
a
cold
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
a
playful
who
is
with
me
in
all
my
summer
days
and
shares
all
her
quaint
thoughts
with
me
and
asks
me
countless
questions
and
accepts
my
dictum
as
gospel
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
a
sister
one
of
that
kind
who
has
the
best
of
all
things
in
life
whilst
i
must
take
the
poor
things
one
of
the
kind
that
is
to
be
married
to
a
count
from
over
the
seas
and
i
must
work
and
hurry
to
get
her
frocks
ready
for
the
wedding
and
then
go
back
to
live
in
a
small
dead
village
all
the
days
of
my
life
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
the
quiet
who
comes
at
my
call
and
retires
at
my
bidding
and
in
this
part
my
friend
annabel
lee
walks
with
exceeding
beauty
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
a
strong
elderly
friend
who
stands
between
me
and
all
icy
blasts
who
lays
out
my
daily
life
who
quiets
my
foolish
excitement
with
her
calmness
and
wisdom
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
one
who
knows
no
law
who
leads
me
in
strange
highways
and
byways
and
whose
mind
for
me
is
a
labyrinth
wherein
i
walk
in
piteous
confusion
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
an
extremely
wicked
person
whom
i
regard
with
fear
whom
it
behooves
me
to
hate
but
whom
i
love
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
a
woman
of
any
age
who
is
above
all
uncompromising
and
unsympathetic
if
i
am
joyous
she
is
placid
if
i
am
heavy
of
heart
she
is
placid
if
i
am
full
of
anticipation
she
is
placid
if
i
am
in
despair
she
is
placid
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
a
shadow
among
shadows
she
is
not
real
i
say
to
myself
one
day
i
shall
awake
and
find
her
vanished
without
pain
and
without
sadness
of
farewell
and
as
if
she
had
not
been
one
is
a
vision
of
her
as
one
who
is
in
the
world
and
of
the
world
and
like
the
rest
of
the
world
and
when
i
contemplate
her
thus
my
thought
is
the
best
thing
of
all
is
to
be
in
the
world
and
of
the
world
and
like
the
rest
of
the
world
to
have
the
quality
of
humanness
to
know
the
world
so
well
as
to
be
able
to
select
the
best
of
its
treasures
and
to
make
useful
that
in
it
which
is
useless
but
all
these
visions
are
vapory
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
is
my
friend
annabel
lee
tis
the
expressions
of
her
lily
face
that
give
me
these
visions
not
that
which
she
says
nor
that
which
she
does
in
truth
she
is
in
some
way
like
all
the
visions
but
each
is
mingled
so
much
with
herself
that
the
type
is
lost
and
my
friend
annabel
lee
though
she
sits
with
the
book
of
the
two
pages
open
before
her
and
seems
much
interested
in
all
that
she
finds
in
it
has
yet
the
look
of
one
who
if
any
one
asked
to
borrow
the
book
from
her
would
close
it
quickly
and
give
it
up
readily
with
no
regret
and
after
she
had
given
away
the
book
it
seems
as
if
she
would
pick
up
a
flower
from
somewhere
near
and
twirl
the
stem
in
her
thumb
and
finger
and
glance
out
the
window
not
that
she
has
a
contempt
for
the
present
as
for
the
future
but
that
it
seems
she
is
not
dependent
on
the
book
of
the
two
pages
for
her
thought
of
it
but
also
there
is
method
in
her
contempt
for
the
future
for
she
deigns
to
consider
that
the
future
becomes
the
present
as
one
day
follows
after
another
but
she
touches
it
not
in
good
faith
until
it
is
indeed
the
present
my
friend
annabel
lee
times
sits
playing
upon
a
little
old
lute
the
future
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
like
a
lute
with
no
strings
you
can
not
play
upon
such
a
lute
and
fill
the
long
long
corridors
in
your
brain
with
the
thin
sweet
meaningless
music
you
can
but
sit
stupidly
staring
into
the
cavity
and
thinking
how
joyous
will
be
the
music
that
shall
come
forth
some
day
as
from
time
to
time
your
lute
is
strung
with
strings
whereas
you
might
better
at
that
moment
go
out
into
your
garden
and
fill
the
cavity
with
tomatoes
and
make
haste
with
them
to
market
and
while
you
sit
dreaming
over
your
stringless
lute
in
your
impatience
you
press
upon
the
stops
and
press
too
much
and
too
often
so
that
when
at
last
your
lute
is
strung
the
stops
will
not
work
right
but
will
stick
fast
in
one
position
and
when
your
other
hand
touches
the
strings
there
will
be
horrible
discord
always
horrible
discord
i
have
never
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
yet
seen
any
one
dreaming
over
an
unstrung
lute
who
did
not
finger
the
having
said
this
my
friend
annabel
lee
gazed
out
over
my
head
at
the
flat
green
atlantic
sea
and
her
hand
went
upon
and
about
her
and
there
came
out
music
and
the
stops
worked
right
like
stops
that
had
not
been
tampered
with
in
the
lute
s
unstrung
days
and
the
music
that
came
out
was
like
yellow
wine
to
the
head
and
went
not
only
into
the
corridors
but
into
the
towers
as
well
and
low
down
by
the
moat
and
within
and
without
the
outer
wall
and
into
the
dungeon
where
had
not
been
music
before
xviii
another
vision
of
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
i
have
a
vision
of
my
friend
annabel
lee
as
a
princess
in
a
tall
tall
castle
by
the
side
of
the
sea
a
castle
made
of
dull
red
granite
that
glows
a
gorgeous
crimson
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
and
all
day
long
there
is
no
sign
of
life
about
the
dull
red
castle
and
also
the
winds
are
low
and
the
blue
water
is
very
quiet
far
down
the
shore
are
only
a
few
gulls
flying
and
wild
ducks
riding
on
the
waves
there
is
nothing
moving
on
the
jagged
rocks
for
miles
about
the
red
castle
but
there
are
growing
in
crevices
some
wild
green
weeds
that
are
full
of
fair
sweet
life
and
all
day
the
sky
is
pale
blue
the
windows
in
the
red
castle
are
of
thick
dark
glass
and
are
grated
and
mullioned
and
set
about
with
iron
the
look
of
these
windows
is
rigid
and
bitter
and
it
shuts
out
everything
that
is
without
the
battlements
of
the
castle
are
high
and
narrow
and
and
dark
and
very
sullen
were
i
upon
the
battlements
i
would
gladly
plunge
off
from
them
down
upon
the
rocks
some
hundreds
of
feet
and
be
dashed
to
pieces
or
into
the
deep
sea
but
below
there
is
a
turret
and
a
belfry
but
no
bell
and
the
turret
is
a
sheltered
and
safe
retreat
looking
out
upon
all
one
who
had
not
been
content
before
in
the
world
might
be
at
last
content
within
the
turret
of
this
tall
red
castle
by
the
side
of
the
sea
away
at
the
meeting
of
the
sea
and
the
sky
there
is
a
narrow
line
that
is
not
pale
blue
like
the
sky
nor
dark
blue
like
the
sea
but
is
only
pale
thin
air
and
i
look
at
it
expecting
to
see
but
in
the
bright
daylight
i
never
know
what
i
expect
to
see
in
the
line
of
thin
air
at
the
meeting
of
the
pale
and
the
dark
and
so
then
all
day
everything
is
dead
quiet
and
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
a
princess
inside
the
red
castle
how
fair
a
princess
is
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
fancy
her
in
a
beautiful
white
gown
embroidered
with
gold
threads
the
gown
is
long
and
narrow
and
fits
closely
about
the
waist
and
trails
on
the
ground
and
upon
the
left
forefinger
of
the
princess
a
great
old
silver
ring
set
with
an
unpolished
turquoise
the
rooms
inside
the
red
castle
are
fit
rooms
for
such
a
princess
they
are
dark
and
high
and
narrow
and
are
adorned
with
frescoes
and
and
the
thick
windows
of
dark
glass
shine
with
marvelous
myriad
coloring
where
the
light
shows
through
before
some
of
the
windows
bits
of
cut
glass
are
hung
and
these
catch
the
sunbeams
and
straightway
countless
rainbows
fall
upon
the
gown
and
the
hands
and
the
hair
of
the
princess
when
the
sun
sets
a
great
bar
of
deep
golden
light
falls
from
afar
upon
the
red
castle
and
it
becomes
magnificent
with
crimson
the
dark
glass
of
the
windows
glows
like
old
copper
the
battlements
are
tipped
with
gold
and
all
is
like
a
great
flower
that
has
but
just
bloomed
after
the
sun
has
set
and
the
crimson
has
faded
once
more
from
the
red
castle
and
the
copper
from
the
windows
and
before
the
light
of
day
has
gone
the
sea
and
the
sky
take
on
different
shades
and
different
meanings
and
the
gulls
and
the
wild
ducks
come
up
from
far
down
the
shore
and
the
rocks
echo
with
their
wild
noises
the
sky
is
full
of
flying
and
the
water
rises
high
and
has
crests
of
white
foam
but
the
line
at
the
horizon
looks
still
the
same
then
the
princess
in
her
white
gown
opens
a
door
high
up
in
the
tall
castle
and
comes
out
under
the
turret
she
comes
forward
to
the
railing
and
leans
upon
it
with
her
fair
chin
resting
in
her
hand
i
see
her
there
across
a
long
stretch
of
dark
water
her
white
frock
gleaming
in
the
pale
light
so
high
up
and
all
and
a
multitude
of
thoughts
come
upon
me
the
princess
looks
at
the
thin
line
of
sky
opposite
her
and
looks
so
steadfastly
that
i
turn
my
eyes
from
her
and
look
there
also
and
now
there
are
manifold
scenes
there
there
is
a
scene
of
a
knight
going
forth
to
do
battle
with
his
black
charger
and
his
shining
steel
armor
and
he
wears
an
orange
plume
in
his
helmet
his
going
is
a
brave
thing
he
is
in
the
rising
of
his
youth
and
strength
and
for
this
reason
i
and
the
princess
on
the
turret
can
see
him
falling
gloriously
in
a
fierce
battle
with
death
in
his
veins
and
the
charger
wandering
off
with
no
rider
into
the
night
and
the
princess
looks
with
envy
upon
one
who
can
go
forth
and
fall
in
battle
there
is
a
scene
of
a
young
woman
in
a
small
room
working
hard
and
persistently
by
a
dim
light
at
some
exquisitely
fine
needlework
upon
an
immense
linen
oblong
and
her
shoulders
are
bent
and
her
eyes
are
strained
and
her
hands
are
weary
and
her
nerves
shattered
and
crying
out
but
she
does
not
leave
off
her
work
she
and
her
work
are
like
an
ant
carrying
away
a
desert
grain
by
grain
and
like
one
miserable
person
building
up
a
pyramid
and
like
one
counting
all
the
stars
one
does
not
know
whose
is
the
linen
or
why
she
works
or
whether
money
will
be
given
her
for
it
but
one
may
know
that
verily
she
will
have
her
reward
such
people
working
like
that
in
small
rooms
and
all
with
wearied
nerves
always
have
their
reward
and
the
princess
on
the
turret
looked
out
at
the
woman
as
if
she
with
her
linen
and
her
needle
were
the
fortunate
one
there
is
a
scene
of
french
canadians
cutting
hay
and
raking
it
early
in
the
summer
afternoon
women
and
men
the
day
is
so
beautifully
hot
and
the
perfume
of
the
grass
is
so
sweet
that
a
tall
red
castle
by
the
side
of
the
sea
is
the
dreariest
place
of
all
the
princess
looks
out
from
her
turret
with
desolate
purple
eyes
she
looks
at
the
ring
upon
her
forefinger
and
together
with
her
i
wonder
why
all
people
were
not
made
french
canadians
making
hay
in
the
fields
over
their
heads
is
the
air
of
the
green
french
canadian
country
under
their
feet
is
the
soft
french
canadian
hay
and
they
have
appetites
for
their
food
there
is
a
scene
of
a
child
playing
in
the
mud
under
a
green
willow
she
has
a
large
pewter
spoon
to
dip
up
great
lumps
of
mud
and
she
takes
up
the
lumps
in
her
two
hands
and
pats
them
and
shapes
them
and
lays
them
down
in
rows
on
a
shingle
water
runs
down
through
the
meadow
near
by
where
she
sits
and
she
dips
it
up
also
in
the
spoon
to
thin
out
the
mud
the
rows
of
on
the
shingle
are
very
neat
and
arranged
with
infinite
care
the
princess
forgets
to
envy
the
child
and
her
in
the
interest
she
takes
in
the
making
of
them
her
face
and
her
purple
eyes
even
take
on
an
indefinite
look
of
contentment
in
that
she
is
in
the
same
world
with
so
fit
a
thing
having
looked
long
at
the
visions
the
princess
takes
her
eyes
from
the
line
of
thin
sky
and
looks
down
into
the
tumbled
dark
water
when
all
is
seen
says
the
princess
there
is
nothing
better
than
wild
dark
water
that
is
too
vast
to
be
measured
and
that
is
good
for
a
thousand
of
years
and
that
contains
yet
as
good
fish
as
ever
came
out
of
it
it
gives
up
pink
shells
upon
the
sand
in
the
kindness
of
its
heart
and
it
sends
wild
whistling
gales
up
to
the
pinnacles
of
my
red
castle
to
sing
for
me
and
to
tell
me
many
stories
and
it
has
wild
winds
wandering
in
and
upon
the
high
walls
and
caves
along
its
rugged
coast
and
if
i
knew
not
that
they
were
winds
i
would
surely
think
them
the
voices
of
singing
high
thin
piercing
voices
mingled
with
the
sound
of
long
washing
waves
and
it
gives
out
dreary
lonesome
cries
a
loon
calling
in
the
night
mists
a
mile
away
and
wild
geese
honking
so
that
i
know
there
are
things
in
it
and
upon
it
a
hundred
times
wilder
and
lonesomer
than
i
and
it
sends
good
ships
driving
against
these
great
rocks
and
dashes
them
to
pieces
and
human
beings
go
down
with
them
to
rest
for
a
thousand
of
years
in
the
depths
so
that
i
know
it
loves
human
beings
well
and
has
need
of
them
in
the
forenoon
of
a
day
in
july
it
melts
my
heart
with
its
glad
warm
sunshine
and
dazzles
my
eyes
and
fills
me
with
comfort
and
i
know
that
life
is
a
safe
thing
when
all
is
seen
says
the
princess
there
is
nothing
better
thus
i
have
a
vision
of
my
friend
annabel
lee
as
a
princess
in
a
tall
red
castle
by
the
side
of
the
sea
but
neither
is
this
my
friend
annabel
lee
for
she
is
more
fascinating
still
and
her
castle
is
even
taller
and
a
deeper
red
and
more
than
all
she
is
herself
xix
the
art
of
contemplation
yesterday
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
i
sat
comfortably
opposite
each
other
at
a
small
table
eating
our
luncheon
she
was
very
fair
and
and
we
had
tiny
broiled
fish
and
some
tea
with
slices
of
lemon
in
it
and
bread
and
green
lettuce
sprinkled
over
with
vinegar
and
oil
and
red
pepper
and
two
mugs
of
ale
food
is
a
lovely
thing
don
t
you
think
said
i
one
of
the
best
ever
invented
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
have
you
considered
how
would
be
gone
from
life
if
there
were
no
food
and
if
we
had
not
to
eat
three
times
every
day
yes
i
ve
considered
it
i
replied
and
it
s
a
pleasure
that
never
it
is
so
much
more
than
pleasure
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
it
is
a
necessity
and
an
art
and
a
relaxation
and
an
unburdening
and
dear
me
it
brings
one
up
to
the
level
of
kings
or
of
the
beasts
that
perish
i
have
fancied
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
a
deal
table
set
three
times
every
day
under
a
beautiful
in
a
far
country
the
would
be
in
a
pasture
where
cattle
are
grazing
and
always
when
i
sat
eating
at
the
deal
table
the
cows
would
stand
about
watching
me
sometimes
on
the
deal
table
there
would
be
brown
bread
and
honey
sometimes
there
would
be
salt
and
cantaloupe
sometimes
there
would
be
lettuce
with
vinegar
and
pepper
and
oil
sometimes
there
would
be
bread
and
curds
and
cream
in
a
brown
earthen
dish
sometimes
there
would
be
walnuts
and
figs
sometimes
there
would
be
two
little
broiled
fish
sometimes
there
would
be
peaches
sometimes
there
would
be
flat
white
biscuits
and
squares
of
brown
fudge
sometimes
there
would
be
bread
and
cheese
sometimes
there
would
be
olives
and
scotch
bannocks
sometimes
there
would
be
a
blue
delft
pot
of
chocolate
and
an
egg
sometimes
there
would
be
tea
and
scones
sometimes
there
would
be
sometimes
there
would
be
bread
and
radishes
sometimes
there
would
be
wine
and
olives
sometimes
there
would
be
a
strawberry
tart
i
should
live
over
the
hill
from
the
and
i
should
come
there
to
eat
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
at
one
in
the
afternoon
and
at
seven
in
the
evening
and
meanwhile
i
should
be
busy
at
some
work
so
that
my
eating
would
be
as
if
i
had
earned
what
sort
of
work
would
you
do
i
asked
i
might
wash
fine
bits
of
lace
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
lay
them
out
upon
a
sunny
to
bleach
and
dry
or
i
might
pick
berries
and
take
them
to
market
or
i
might
sit
in
a
doorway
making
baskets
i
should
make
beautiful
little
baskets
or
i
might
care
for
a
small
garden
or
a
flock
of
geese
to
feed
them
with
grains
and
keep
them
from
straying
away
so
many
hours
must
i
tend
my
flock
so
many
hours
must
i
sport
myself
so
many
hours
must
i
contemplate
i
should
do
all
these
things
while
tending
my
flock
and
i
should
tend
my
flock
well
i
should
do
all
my
work
well
so
that
the
food
on
the
deal
table
under
the
would
taste
as
if
it
had
been
earned
but
would
it
not
be
strange
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
eating
daintily
of
lettuce
and
fish
after
i
had
had
this
way
of
living
in
a
country
of
for
six
months
or
seven
months
oh
i
should
grow
vastly
weary
of
it
and
not
only
should
i
grow
weary
of
the
garden
or
the
geese
or
the
baskets
and
the
deal
table
under
the
but
i
should
grow
weary
of
everything
the
fair
green
world
could
anyway
offer
in
the
so
many
hours
that
i
should
contemplate
i
should
arrive
at
this
there
can
be
nothing
better
in
the
way
of
living
than
caring
for
a
garden
or
a
flock
of
geese
and
going
up
a
hill
to
a
to
eat
three
times
every
day
if
i
do
my
work
faithfully
so
then
when
the
gray
dawn
should
break
some
morning
and
i
should
awaken
and
find
an
aching
at
my
heart
i
should
know
that
the
best
had
failed
me
and
i
should
see
the
vast
weariness
with
me
hast
thou
found
me
out
oh
mine
enemy
would
run
over
and
over
in
my
mind
and
all
that
day
the
tending
of
the
flocks
would
be
a
hard
thing
and
the
apples
on
the
deal
table
under
the
would
turn
to
dust
in
my
my
friend
annabel
lee
laid
down
her
small
silver
fork
and
placed
her
hands
one
upon
another
on
her
knee
and
sat
silent
oh
she
was
a
beautiful
brilliant
person
sitting
there
i
wondered
hazily
as
i
watched
her
how
much
of
the
day
s
gold
sunshine
she
made
up
for
me
and
how
much
would
vanish
were
she
to
vanish
presently
she
talked
again
much
depends
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
upon
the
amount
of
contemplation
that
one
does
in
one
s
way
of
living
and
upon
how
one
s
contemplation
runs
contemplation
is
a
thing
that
does
a
great
deal
of
mischief
but
i
daresay
that
when
it
as
an
art
is
made
perfect
it
is
a
rare
good
thing
and
a
neat
obedient
servant
and
knows
exactly
when
to
enter
the
mind
and
when
to
leave
it
and
whosoever
may
have
it
thus
brought
to
a
state
of
perfection
is
a
most
fortunate
possessor
and
must
need
go
bravely
down
the
world
perhaps
now
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
when
one
is
a
and
goes
to
eat
at
a
deal
table
under
a
green
one
should
contemplate
only
kings
in
gilded
palaces
one
should
begin
at
the
beginning
of
a
king
s
life
it
may
be
and
follow
it
step
by
step
through
heaviness
and
strife
until
one
sees
in
one
s
vivid
fancy
the
king
at
last
tottering
and
and
forsaken
toward
his
lonely
grave
or
else
one
should
contemplate
the
life
of
a
laborer
who
must
eat
husks
all
his
days
and
is
not
worthy
of
his
hire
and
goes
from
bad
to
worse
and
becomes
a
beggar
or
else
one
should
contemplate
the
being
of
a
sweet
maid
whose
life
is
a
fair
round
rose
garden
and
the
thorns
safely
hidden
and
the
stems
pruned
and
all
and
one
should
likewise
follow
her
step
by
step
to
her
grave
or
if
one
so
fancies
to
the
culmination
of
all
happiness
and
success
for
the
idea
is
that
in
all
one
s
contemplation
when
one
is
a
one
should
contemplate
anything
and
everything
except
the
being
and
condition
of
a
but
a
better
idea
still
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
would
be
to
not
contemplate
at
all
you
know
but
eat
the
radishes
and
other
things
under
the
and
rejoice
at
any
rate
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
we
need
not
contemplate
what
with
these
two
little
fishes
and
these
green
crisp
she
picked
up
her
small
silver
fork
again
and
went
to
eating
lettuce
and
presently
we
both
lifted
our
mugs
of
good
ale
and
drank
to
that
which
would
be
a
better
idea
still
xx
concerning
little
willy
kaatenstein
i
had
one
day
given
my
friend
annabel
lee
the
bare
outline
of
the
facts
in
a
case
and
i
asked
her
if
she
would
kindly
make
a
story
from
it
and
tell
it
me
so
my
friend
annabel
lee
told
me
a
little
story
that
also
runs
in
my
mind
someway
in
measure
and
rhythm
there
lived
in
a
town
in
montana
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
not
very
long
ago
in
a
quiet
street
a
family
of
that
sort
of
persons
which
is
called
jewish
and
it
is
so
short
a
time
ago
that
they
are
there
yet
their
name
was
kaatenstein
there
was
kaatenstein
and
kaatenstein
and
the
four
young
children
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
and
there
was
the
hired
girl
whose
name
was
emma
and
there
was
uncle
will
kaatenstein
s
brother
who
lived
with
them
mrs
kaatenstein
was
short
and
dark
and
sometimes
quite
cross
and
she
always
put
up
fruit
in
its
season
with
the
help
of
the
hired
girl
and
the
kitchen
was
then
very
warm
and
kaatenstein
was
also
dark
but
was
a
tall
slim
man
and
was
kind
and
fond
of
the
children
especially
the
two
little
girls
kaatenstein
was
fond
of
the
children
also
but
mostly
fond
of
the
two
boys
and
harry
kaatenstein
was
much
like
his
mother
only
he
was
not
so
dark
and
he
was
ten
years
old
and
leah
kaatenstein
was
ten
years
old
also
the
two
were
twins
and
she
had
an
eye
for
strict
economy
and
wore
plain
gingham
frocks
and
had
a
long
dark
braid
of
hair
and
played
with
very
homely
dolls
and
jenny
kaatenstein
was
seven
years
old
and
was
most
uncommonly
fat
and
was
rarely
seen
without
a
bit
of
unleavened
bread
in
her
hand
for
the
children
were
allowed
to
have
all
that
they
wanted
of
unleavened
bread
they
did
not
want
very
much
of
it
except
jenny
and
they
all
preferred
to
eat
leavened
bread
spread
with
butter
and
sprinkled
with
sugar
but
they
couldn
t
have
as
much
as
they
wanted
of
that
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
was
only
four
and
pronounced
all
his
words
correctly
and
seemed
sometimes
possessed
of
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
he
had
very
curly
hair
and
it
seemed
an
unwritten
law
that
whenever
a
lady
passed
by
and
saw
the
children
playing
on
the
walk
in
front
of
their
house
she
must
stop
and
exclaim
what
a
pretty
boy
little
willy
was
and
ask
him
for
one
of
his
curls
whereat
little
willy
would
stare
up
into
the
lady
s
face
in
a
most
disconcerting
fashion
and
perhaps
ask
her
for
one
of
curls
or
if
the
groceryman
or
the
butcher
would
stop
on
his
way
to
the
kitchen
and
ask
little
willy
what
was
his
name
and
how
old
was
he
little
willy
would
answer
with
surprising
promptness
and
directly
would
ask
the
groceryman
or
the
butcher
what
was
name
and
how
old
was
and
emma
the
hired
girl
was
and
and
frightfully
and
unsympathetic
and
she
had
a
sister
who
came
to
see
her
and
sat
in
the
hot
kitchen
talking
while
emma
pared
potatoes
or
scrubbed
the
floor
the
sister
s
name
was
juley
and
she
sometimes
brought
strange
green
candy
to
the
children
which
their
mother
never
allowed
them
to
eat
and
sometimes
juley
brought
them
which
they
were
not
allowed
to
chew
and
uncle
will
was
a
short
stout
man
with
a
face
that
was
nearly
always
flushed
he
seemed
fond
of
beer
there
were
a
great
many
cases
of
beer
in
the
cellar
which
belonged
to
uncle
will
and
there
were
cases
full
of
that
had
all
been
emptied
and
the
children
would
have
liked
to
sell
the
bottles
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
sell
bottles
uncle
will
was
also
fond
of
little
willy
and
on
summer
evenings
when
he
and
kaatenstein
were
at
home
and
after
they
had
eaten
dinner
uncle
will
might
have
been
heard
inviting
little
willy
in
his
hoarse
facetious
voice
to
come
and
have
a
glass
of
beer
with
him
and
when
little
willy
with
his
short
curls
and
his
small
white
suit
would
come
and
just
taste
of
the
beer
and
would
make
a
wry
mouth
and
shed
a
few
abortive
tears
over
its
bitterness
uncle
will
would
laugh
very
heartily
and
jovially
indeed
mrs
kaatenstein
had
a
great
many
ducks
and
geese
in
the
and
spent
much
time
among
them
fattening
them
to
eat
and
fussing
over
them
in
the
forenoons
so
the
children
never
played
there
in
the
forenoon
there
were
a
great
number
of
things
that
the
kaatenstein
children
were
not
allowed
to
do
the
things
they
were
allowed
to
do
were
as
nothing
by
comparison
and
the
things
they
were
allowed
to
do
were
for
the
most
part
things
they
did
not
care
about
they
had
each
a
square
iron
bank
in
which
were
ever
so
many
silver
quarters
and
dimes
and
and
nickels
and
gold
pieces
too
for
they
were
a
jewish
family
their
father
and
their
uncle
will
kept
dropping
coins
into
the
little
slits
in
the
tops
of
the
banks
from
time
to
time
and
friends
of
the
family
would
also
kindly
contribute
and
their
uncles
and
aunts
would
send
money
for
that
purpose
all
the
way
from
cincinnati
so
there
was
wealth
in
these
banks
but
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
have
any
of
it
and
they
were
never
given
any
money
to
throw
away
buying
things
as
their
mother
said
except
a
nickel
once
in
a
long
while
one
nickel
for
the
four
of
them
and
there
were
toys
that
their
father
and
mother
and
uncle
will
had
bought
for
them
and
others
that
were
sent
by
the
uncles
and
aunts
in
cincinnati
but
they
were
never
allowed
to
play
with
them
the
toys
were
kept
in
a
large
bureau
in
their
mother
s
there
was
a
small
tinkling
piano
that
leah
kaatenstein
s
aunt
barbara
had
sent
to
her
or
that
had
been
sent
to
her
parents
in
trust
for
her
and
there
was
a
little
engine
that
would
run
on
a
track
which
had
once
been
given
to
harry
kaatenstein
and
there
was
an
immense
wax
doll
which
had
fallen
to
jenny
kaatenstein
s
lot
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
was
the
reputed
owner
of
a
small
mechanical
circus
with
tiny
wooden
acrobats
and
horses
and
a
musical
box
beneath
the
platform
and
there
were
other
toys
of
all
kinds
for
the
relatives
in
cincinnati
had
been
lavish
but
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
make
use
of
them
so
they
languished
in
the
bureau
and
harry
kaatenstein
had
a
fine
gold
watch
that
his
mother
had
given
him
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
wear
it
or
even
look
at
it
it
was
kept
in
a
in
her
and
leah
kaatenstein
had
a
fine
gold
watch
that
her
grandmother
in
cincinnati
had
sent
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
wear
it
or
even
look
at
it
it
was
kept
in
her
mother
s
and
jenny
kaatenstein
had
a
fine
gold
watch
that
her
aunt
rebecca
had
sent
but
she
was
not
allowed
to
wear
it
or
even
look
at
it
it
was
kept
in
her
mother
s
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
had
a
fine
gold
watch
that
uncle
will
had
bought
for
him
and
uncle
will
who
was
a
privileged
character
in
the
house
would
sometimes
take
little
willy
s
watch
from
kaatenstein
s
and
give
it
to
little
willy
to
wear
in
the
evening
when
the
family
was
gathered
in
the
and
uncle
will
would
drink
his
beer
and
ask
little
willy
what
time
was
it
but
before
kaatenstein
put
little
willy
to
bed
she
replaced
the
watch
carefully
in
the
the
children
had
a
great
many
such
possessions
but
what
they
really
had
to
play
with
was
a
small
wagon
which
they
put
to
many
uses
in
the
course
of
a
day
sometimes
it
was
a
and
sometimes
a
and
sometimes
a
and
sometimes
a
carriage
and
sometimes
an
ambulance
and
sometimes
a
for
leah
kaatenstein
s
homely
dolls
which
by
some
strange
chance
were
hers
to
do
with
as
she
would
they
were
not
of
excessive
value
and
sometimes
for
a
patrol
wagon
and
sometimes
for
a
they
had
also
a
little
rocking
chair
with
which
they
played
house
on
the
porch
both
the
chair
and
the
wagon
were
much
overworked
and
were
most
pathetic
in
appearance
the
children
often
grew
weary
of
playing
always
with
these
two
things
and
languished
for
other
amusement
sometimes
leah
kaatenstein
subsided
into
the
rocking
chair
with
her
homely
dolls
in
her
lap
and
talked
to
them
seriously
telling
them
many
things
which
would
be
of
use
to
them
all
their
lives
and
instilling
into
them
strict
rules
of
economy
and
sometimes
harry
kaatenstein
sat
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
porch
with
the
nozzle
of
the
long
rubber
hose
which
was
attached
to
the
faucet
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
with
which
kaatenstein
or
uncle
will
watered
the
grass
in
the
evening
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
water
the
grass
but
there
was
usually
water
enough
trickling
from
the
hose
for
harry
kaatenstein
to
make
little
whirlpools
on
the
steps
which
he
did
causing
loss
of
life
among
bugs
of
divers
kinds
and
sometimes
jenny
kaatenstein
with
her
inevitable
bit
of
unleavened
bread
sat
on
the
top
step
and
pudgy
resting
from
her
labors
and
sometimes
little
willy
kaatenstein
climbed
up
and
sat
upon
the
post
at
the
bottom
of
the
stoop
and
kicked
it
viciously
with
his
heels
he
often
sat
there
kicking
as
could
be
plainly
seen
by
the
dents
in
the
post
one
warm
day
the
kaatenstein
children
were
thus
languishing
after
having
played
hard
with
the
wagon
and
emma
was
ironing
in
the
kitchen
their
mother
was
away
for
the
afternoon
and
the
children
had
a
delightful
sense
of
freedom
even
with
the
grim
emma
in
charge
only
they
wished
they
had
a
nickel
harry
kaatenstein
said
that
if
they
had
a
nickel
he
should
certainly
go
down
to
grove
s
a
block
and
a
half
away
and
purchase
some
brown
and
white
cookies
at
which
little
willy
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
more
especially
jenny
kaatenstein
smacked
their
lips
and
leah
kaatenstein
sighed
and
remarked
that
harry
s
extravagance
was
very
discouraging
presently
wonderful
to
relate
emma
appeared
around
the
corner
from
the
kitchen
with
four
thick
slices
of
slightly
sprinkled
with
sugar
and
the
children
gazed
very
eagerly
in
her
direction
jenny
kaatenstein
dropped
her
piece
of
unleavened
bread
and
to
meet
emma
but
thought
better
of
it
knowing
emma
s
ways
emma
distributed
the
slices
of
bread
and
fastened
little
willy
kaatenstein
s
hat
on
more
firmly
with
the
elastic
under
his
chin
and
informed
the
children
that
if
they
knew
what
was
good
for
themselves
they
would
not
get
into
any
mischief
while
had
charge
of
them
then
she
went
back
to
her
ironing
the
children
were
delighted
with
their
and
their
imagination
played
lightly
about
it
my
s
raspberry
said
harry
kaatenstein
s
said
leah
kaatenstein
waxing
genial
s
said
jenny
kaatenstein
but
little
willy
kaatenstein
said
never
a
word
for
his
seemed
very
good
to
him
their
someway
put
new
life
into
them
and
made
them
more
fully
awake
to
the
fact
that
their
mother
was
away
for
the
afternoon
after
all
they
were
not
afraid
of
any
one
but
their
mother
and
she
being
gone
should
they
not
enjoy
life
for
once
when
they
had
finished
eating
they
had
a
brilliant
idea
i
m
going
to
shake
a
nickel
out
of
my
bank
said
harry
kaatenstein
going
to
shake
a
nickel
out
of
bank
said
leah
kaatenstein
in
surprising
luxury
of
spirit
going
to
shake
a
nickel
out
of
bank
said
jenny
kaatenstein
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
said
never
a
word
but
ran
at
the
first
inkling
of
the
idea
immediately
to
the
where
the
four
banks
were
standing
on
the
mantel
above
the
and
pushed
up
a
chair
and
took
down
his
own
green
bank
and
then
he
slid
back
the
little
piece
of
iron
that
was
just
under
the
slot
in
the
top
of
the
bank
and
shook
shook
shook
with
very
little
noise
and
lo
not
a
nickel
but
a
gold
coin
rolled
out
on
the
floor
and
then
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
rushed
in
and
seized
their
banks
and
began
shaking
shaking
with
much
of
silver
and
gold
against
iron
for
was
not
their
mother
far
from
them
whilst
little
willy
kaatenstein
stood
by
with
his
gold
piece
clasped
tight
in
his
hand
even
his
young
intelligence
knew
its
marvelous
value
and
he
thought
it
wise
not
to
reveal
his
treasure
to
leah
kaatenstein
s
horrified
gaze
i
m
going
down
to
grove
s
and
buy
with
my
nickel
said
harry
kaatenstein
pounding
and
shaking
but
never
a
nickel
appeared
for
the
reason
that
he
had
forgotten
the
little
iron
slide
which
only
once
in
a
while
fell
away
from
under
the
slot
and
never
at
the
right
time
going
down
to
grove
s
and
buy
a
long
licorice
pipe
with
nickel
said
leah
kaatenstein
a
long
licorice
pipe
was
the
very
most
she
could
get
for
her
money
also
shaking
and
pounding
fruitlessly
for
she
too
had
forgotten
the
little
iron
slide
going
down
to
grove
s
and
buy
some
cookies
with
nickel
said
jenny
kaatenstein
likewise
pounding
and
shaking
and
forgetting
the
little
iron
slide
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
said
never
a
word
but
when
he
had
learned
what
to
buy
with
his
money
he
ran
out
of
the
front
door
and
down
the
street
to
grove
s
on
the
corner
now
when
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
considered
and
rejoiced
over
the
absence
of
their
mother
they
forgot
at
the
same
time
to
consider
and
fear
the
perilous
nearness
of
emma
ironing
in
the
kitchen
the
kitchen
being
next
to
the
suddenly
while
they
were
in
the
midst
of
their
work
and
were
shaking
and
pounding
away
for
dear
life
unconscious
of
all
else
the
door
leading
into
the
kitchen
was
pushed
open
with
ominous
quiet
and
the
head
of
emma
appeared
it
was
an
unprepossessing
head
at
all
times
and
it
was
a
head
at
that
moment
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
perceived
this
vision
at
once
and
an
appalling
silence
like
the
tomb
followed
the
clamor
that
had
been
so
this
is
what
you
re
up
to
you
young
limbs
said
emma
and
swooped
down
and
pounced
upon
them
before
they
could
possibly
escape
though
they
had
made
for
the
door
with
very
creditable
speed
emma
held
them
with
one
hand
while
she
picked
up
the
banks
with
the
other
she
remarked
in
unmeasured
terms
upon
the
condition
of
the
waxed
floor
upon
the
vicious
qualities
of
some
children
whom
she
mentioned
by
name
upon
what
would
happen
to
them
when
their
mother
came
home
and
upon
what
was
going
to
happen
to
them
right
away
and
she
led
them
upstairs
to
their
mother
s
and
after
shaking
them
well
locked
them
in
and
went
downstairs
carrying
the
key
with
her
meanwhile
little
willy
kaatenstein
had
gone
upon
his
interesting
errand
at
grove
s
on
the
corner
he
went
into
the
shop
and
stood
before
a
glittering
glass
case
of
things
and
what
ll
it
be
for
master
kaatenstein
said
the
man
behind
the
glittering
case
i
want
and
licorice
pipes
and
cookies
and
some
watermelons
said
little
willy
kaatenstein
and
laid
the
shining
gold
coin
before
the
grocer
s
astonished
eyes
for
the
grocer
had
expected
to
see
the
kaatenstein
nickel
nothing
more
or
less
is
this
yours
master
kaatenstein
said
the
grocer
eyeing
the
coin
with
suspicion
of
course
it
s
mine
said
little
willy
kaatenstein
impatiently
and
i
want
the
things
right
well
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
my
boy
said
the
grocer
if
it
isn
t
of
us
ll
have
to
suffer
i
guess
now
what
did
you
say
you
wanted
little
willy
kaatenstein
repeated
his
order
and
added
other
items
now
master
kaatenstein
said
the
grocer
you
never
will
be
able
to
carry
all
that
that
ll
make
a
pile
of
stuff
better
run
back
and
get
your
little
wagon
for
he
knew
the
kaatenstein
wagon
having
often
placed
in
it
a
paper
of
sugar
or
a
sack
of
salt
or
three
tins
of
something
according
to
kaatenstein
s
order
for
the
children
to
draw
home
so
little
willy
kaatenstein
ran
back
and
got
the
little
wagon
from
the
front
yard
and
the
man
loaded
the
things
into
it
must
be
going
to
have
a
picnic
he
observed
there
was
certainly
a
pile
of
stuff
there
were
long
licorice
pipes
enough
in
the
wagon
to
surfeit
the
appetites
of
the
four
kaatensteins
for
many
a
day
and
the
name
of
the
was
legion
and
there
were
two
watermelons
and
cookies
enough
to
satisfy
even
jenny
kaatenstein
s
capacious
desire
also
there
were
nuts
and
some
pies
and
a
great
many
little
dogs
and
cats
and
elephants
made
of
a
very
tough
kind
of
candy
which
all
the
kaatenstein
children
thought
perfectly
lovely
also
there
were
figs
in
boxes
and
and
red
and
white
sticks
of
candy
flavored
with
peppermint
fit
to
make
one
s
mouth
water
and
all
these
things
were
in
surprising
quantity
and
made
so
heavy
a
load
that
little
willy
kaatenstein
was
hard
put
to
it
to
drag
it
up
the
street
but
little
willy
kaatenstein
had
strong
little
arms
and
he
and
the
wagon
made
slow
and
sure
progress
back
to
the
kaatenstein
home
the
grocer
stood
out
in
front
of
his
shop
gazing
after
the
boy
and
the
boy
s
wagon
and
the
wagon
s
contents
with
a
puzzled
and
somewhat
dubious
smile
little
willy
kaatenstein
proceeded
into
his
front
yard
with
the
wagon
and
around
to
the
back
on
the
side
of
the
house
where
the
kitchen
door
was
not
he
dragged
the
wagon
quietly
on
to
the
farther
end
of
the
back
yard
and
opened
the
gate
of
the
pen
made
of
laths
where
kaatenstein
s
ducks
and
geese
were
kept
he
drew
the
wagon
in
and
back
behind
the
and
left
it
then
little
willy
kaatenstein
closed
the
lath
gate
and
ran
to
find
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
and
invite
them
to
the
feast
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
he
hunted
about
in
the
house
and
out
of
doors
but
there
was
no
sign
of
them
and
for
some
reason
he
thought
he
would
not
ask
emma
questions
touching
on
their
whereabouts
so
having
hunted
for
his
relatives
all
that
he
thought
best
little
willy
kaatenstein
could
but
go
out
on
the
highways
and
byways
and
call
in
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
accordingly
he
slipped
through
the
fence
and
went
back
into
the
to
the
house
immediately
behind
his
own
in
search
of
bill
and
katy
kelly
two
irish
friends
of
the
kaatenstein
children
with
whom
they
were
not
allowed
to
play
bill
and
katy
kelly
to
be
sure
were
neither
lame
nor
halt
nor
blind
but
were
very
sound
in
limb
and
constitution
and
were
extremely
responsive
to
little
willy
kaatenstein
s
invitation
to
come
to
the
feast
feasts
were
things
that
bill
and
katy
kelly
reveled
in
when
they
had
opportunity
so
in
company
with
little
willy
kaatenstein
he
in
his
curls
and
his
white
suit
and
the
two
in
very
dingy
raiment
they
hied
them
through
the
fence
to
the
feast
they
reached
the
without
being
seen
by
emma
the
and
found
the
little
wagon
safe
and
the
ducks
and
geese
staring
and
peering
and
stretching
their
necks
at
it
and
its
contents
with
much
curiosity
this
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
fowls
must
have
changed
to
amazement
when
they
beheld
the
attack
made
on
the
wagon
and
the
strange
things
in
the
way
of
eating
that
followed
how
bill
and
katy
kelly
did
eat
and
how
they
reveled
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
literally
waded
in
and
long
licorice
pipes
they
began
the
feast
with
pie
from
pie
they
went
at
figs
from
figs
they
transferred
to
the
tough
little
animals
and
from
that
to
cookies
and
from
cookies
to
long
licorice
pipes
then
they
stopped
eating
consecutively
and
went
at
the
entire
feast
they
ate
fast
and
furiously
for
several
minutes
then
the
first
ardor
of
the
feast
subsided
and
little
willy
kaatenstein
for
one
seemed
to
lose
all
interest
not
only
in
feasts
but
in
the
world
at
large
he
sat
back
upon
a
box
which
contained
a
duck
sitting
on
twelve
eggs
and
looked
at
the
ground
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
someway
lost
his
perspective
bill
and
katy
kelly
still
ate
but
more
it
seemed
from
a
sense
of
duty
to
themselves
than
from
appetite
and
presently
their
eating
became
desultory
and
they
began
to
throw
remnants
of
the
feast
to
the
fowls
these
at
first
gazed
askance
at
the
extraordinary
food
thus
lavished
upon
them
but
finally
went
at
it
madly
as
if
they
too
reveled
in
feasts
mrs
kaatenstein
s
face
must
need
have
been
a
study
could
she
have
seen
her
cherished
ducks
and
geese
stuffing
their
crops
with
licorice
pipes
and
but
kaatenstein
was
out
for
the
afternoon
while
these
things
were
happening
in
her
no
less
interesting
ones
were
taking
place
in
her
where
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
were
prisoners
of
emma
at
first
they
merely
sat
on
the
and
discussed
the
several
untoward
things
that
they
wished
would
happen
to
emma
having
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
that
lady
until
they
could
no
more
they
felt
better
then
they
looked
over
their
mother
s
room
in
search
of
amusement
with
the
result
that
the
bureau
containing
the
toys
with
which
they
were
not
allowed
to
play
was
made
to
give
forth
the
wealth
of
its
treasures
the
floor
of
kaatenstein
s
presented
a
motley
appearance
jenny
kaatenstein
even
forgot
to
miss
her
bit
of
unleavened
bread
in
her
excitement
over
the
fact
that
she
actually
was
holding
her
own
huge
wax
doll
in
her
lap
and
the
circus
and
the
and
the
tinkling
piano
and
the
and
the
barking
dogs
and
the
picture
books
and
the
manifold
other
things
were
at
last
put
to
those
uses
for
which
they
had
been
destined
and
they
even
went
to
the
and
got
out
their
watches
but
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
though
they
were
pleasantly
excited
were
yet
highly
uneasy
in
their
minds
they
knew
they
had
yet
to
render
up
payment
for
the
day
s
the
rest
of
the
tale
is
obvious
enough
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
laughing
gently
and
changing
her
tone
but
please
tell
it
said
i
with
much
eagerness
well
then
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
the
afternoon
waned
and
kaatenstein
came
home
she
heard
unusual
noises
in
her
beloved
and
fled
thither
as
fast
as
her
goodly
proportions
would
allow
her
eyes
met
a
sight
which
was
maddening
to
them
they
beheld
little
willy
kaatenstein
looking
decidedly
pale
and
puffy
sitting
weakly
on
a
box
containing
a
and
the
two
objectionable
kelly
children
actually
at
that
moment
feeding
her
choicest
goose
with
scattered
all
about
the
once
neat
duck
yard
was
rubbish
in
frightful
variety
and
a
of
her
tiny
ducklings
were
busy
at
an
atrocious
watermelon
certainly
no
one
but
those
irish
young
ones
could
have
brought
in
so
much
litter
it
did
not
take
bill
and
katy
kelly
long
to
gather
that
they
were
not
wanted
there
kaatenstein
quite
quenched
for
the
time
their
fondness
for
feasts
as
they
went
she
ordered
them
to
take
their
vile
belongings
with
them
which
they
were
willing
enough
to
do
as
much
of
them
as
they
could
carry
they
bestowed
an
apprehensive
glance
on
little
willy
kaatenstein
but
little
willy
kaatenstein
s
face
was
only
pale
puffy
and
very
passive
having
dispersed
the
kellys
kaatenstein
led
her
son
into
the
house
and
stopped
in
the
kitchen
to
demand
of
emma
why
she
allowed
such
things
to
happen
and
ordered
her
to
go
at
once
and
clean
out
the
emma
obeyed
first
giving
up
kaatenstein
s
key
and
explaining
her
own
possession
of
it
then
kaatenstein
after
doctoring
little
willy
kaatenstein
s
poor
little
stomach
and
laying
him
neatly
out
on
a
sofa
in
a
cool
dark
room
went
on
to
her
own
room
whence
proceeded
unusual
noises
unlocking
and
opening
the
door
a
sight
the
like
of
which
she
had
not
of
late
years
known
overwhelmed
her
spirit
the
short
dead
silence
that
followed
her
appearance
on
the
threshhold
was
but
emphasized
by
the
merry
tinkling
of
the
gay
little
circus
which
had
been
wound
up
and
would
not
stop
even
under
the
dark
influence
of
impending
well
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
the
case
of
harry
kaatenstein
and
leah
kaatenstein
and
jenny
kaatenstein
was
attended
to
by
their
mother
she
whipped
them
all
soundly
and
sent
them
to
bed
but
as
for
little
willy
kaatenstein
not
looking
in
the
least
pale
or
puffy
he
sat
that
evening
after
dinner
on
uncle
will
s
lap
wearing
his
own
fine
gold
watch
out
of
the
and
being
continually
invited
to
have
a
glass
of
beer
but
in
the
kitchen
emma
was
telling
juley
that
though
she
had
once
thought
a
great
deal
of
little
willy
kaatenstein
she
now
honestly
believed
him
to
be
the
very
worst
one
of
the
that
story
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
was
very
tiresome
you
shouldn
t
ask
me
to
tell
you
i
am
sorry
if
it
tired
you
i
said
but
the
story
was
entirely
fascinating
it
was
like
the
kaatensteins
and
you
telling
a
story
of
the
kaatensteins
are
delicately
oh
delicately
incongruous
were
ever
at
a
feast
in
the
kaatenstein
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
yes
indeed
said
i
along
with
bill
and
katy
kelly
at
the
age
of
eleven
and
i
have
seen
every
toy
in
the
and
which
would
you
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
to
be
at
a
feast
with
the
kaatensteins
at
the
age
of
eleven
or
here
now
with
me
when
all
s
said
said
i
here
with
you
now
by
tis
very
good
of
you
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
looked
at
me
with
her
purple
eyes
xxi
a
bond
of
sympathy
having
told
me
stories
my
friend
annabel
lee
demanded
that
i
should
write
a
bit
of
verse
to
read
to
her
my
verse
is
rather
rotten
verse
and
i
told
her
so
she
replied
that
the
fact
of
its
being
rotten
had
but
little
to
do
with
the
matter
that
most
verse
was
rotten
anyway
and
usually
the
more
rotten
the
better
it
suited
the
reader
she
was
in
that
mood
so
i
wrote
some
lines
and
read
them
to
her
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
had
been
kind
in
telling
me
stories
though
probably
she
told
them
because
it
amused
her
when
i
finished
reading
she
said
that
the
verse
was
not
rotten
at
all
she
for
her
part
would
call
it
not
yet
quite
ripe
that
s
the
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
as
for
the
meaning
of
the
words
in
it
that
betrays
many
things
the
most
vivid
thing
it
betrays
is
your
age
it
shows
that
you
have
passed
over
the
period
of
nineteen
and
have
arrived
at
exactly
and
therefore
it
is
a
triumphant
bit
of
verse
don
t
you
know
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
how
much
verse
there
is
thrown
upon
the
world
that
means
whatsoever
and
so
when
one
does
happen
upon
a
bit
of
it
that
tells
even
the
smallest
thing
like
the
height
of
the
writer
or
the
color
of
his
hair
then
one
feels
repaid
and
your
verse
tells
still
other
things
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
one
is
that
you
still
think
as
we
ve
agreed
once
before
of
that
which
will
one
day
open
wondrously
for
i
did
not
agree
to
that
you
know
said
i
well
then
i
agreed
to
it
for
both
of
us
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
your
verse
betrays
that
so
plainly
that
one
is
led
to
feel
that
there
are
persons
who
grow
more
hopeful
with
each
bit
of
darkness
that
comes
to
them
if
your
life
were
all
fire
and
sunshine
you
would
write
very
different
verse
and
if
it
told
anything
at
all
it
would
tell
that
while
you
looked
forward
to
still
more
fire
and
sunshine
you
would
somehow
know
you
were
not
really
to
have
any
more
but
that
it
would
grow
less
and
less
in
the
years
and
by
the
time
you
were
an
old
lady
and
still
not
nearly
ready
to
die
it
would
give
out
that
would
be
by
the
law
of
compensation
said
i
and
it
would
require
a
great
deal
of
fire
and
sunshine
in
her
early
life
to
compensate
any
one
who
had
grown
into
an
old
lady
and
had
run
out
of
so
it
would
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
now
when
you
grow
old
though
you
will
never
be
that
which
is
called
an
old
lady
you
will
be
quite
mellow
and
probably
the
less
you
have
to
be
mellow
over
the
mellower
you
will
i
don
t
wish
to
be
that
way
said
i
i
think
that
kind
of
person
is
pitiful
living
year
after
you
ll
not
be
pitiful
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
you
can
not
be
mellow
and
pitiful
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
that
to
be
mellow
is
the
best
thing
and
the
most
comfortable
it
maybe
that
people
struggle
through
a
long
life
with
but
one
object
in
their
minds
to
be
mellow
in
their
old
age
this
verse
certainly
sounds
as
if
were
looking
forward
to
i
can
t
see
that
it
sounds
that
way
at
all
said
i
of
course
you
can
t
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
you
wrote
the
verse
and
you
are
but
and
what
are
some
of
the
other
things
that
it
betrays
i
inquired
it
betrays
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
that
you
are
better
in
detail
than
you
are
in
the
entire
and
if
that
is
true
of
you
in
one
thing
it
is
true
of
you
in
everything
i
daresay
your
friends
find
things
in
you
that
they
like
extremely
but
you
in
the
entire
they
look
upon
as
something
that
has
much
to
not
my
said
i
yes
your
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
that
is
a
bitter
thing
for
a
verse
to
show
i
made
answer
and
a
bitter
thing
to
have
in
my
well
and
aren
t
you
wise
enough
to
prefer
the
bitter
things
to
the
sweet
things
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
for
every
sweet
thing
that
you
have
in
your
mind
it
is
yours
to
pay
a
mighty
bitter
price
whereas
the
bitter
things
are
valuable
possessions
and
if
it
is
true
about
your
friends
of
course
you
wish
to
know
no
said
i
i
don
t
wish
to
know
but
at
least
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
with
a
wonderful
softening
of
her
voice
into
something
that
was
sincere
and
enchanting
believe
what
i
told
you
about
it
for
in
that
case
you
and
i
have
that
good
gift
a
bond
of
sympathy
for
if
i
had
friends
of
that
kind
they
would
look
upon
me
as
something
with
much
to
acquire
very
sure
but
don
t
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
hastily
consider
the
bond
of
sympathy
a
sweet
thing
remember
the
mighty
bitter
i
will
believe
what
you
said
about
the
friends
said
i
and
it
is
bitter
enough
to
purge
my
soul
for
a
time
the
bond
of
sympathy
is
not
a
sweet
thing
anyway
i
don
t
expect
to
have
to
pay
for
it
and
it
brings
a
feeling
of
a
bond
of
sympathy
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
comes
already
paid
for
it
does
very
well
it
is
not
sweet
it
tastes
more
like
a
cigarette
or
an
olive
about
the
verse
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
please
let
s
not
talk
about
that
any
more
said
i
whatever
you
like
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
we
talked
of
george
sand
and
her
books
but
anyway
this
was
my
bit
of
unripe
verse
yesterday
my
star
went
down
in
the
deep
shadows
it
went
lightly
like
the
rippling
of
water
and
many
tiny
dear
things
went
with
it
and
i
watched
them
i
knew
that
my
star
would
never
rise
again
yesterday
my
star
went
down
in
the
deep
shadows
it
went
softly
like
the
of
evening
and
as
it
went
my
frantic
thoughts
pursued
it
without
hoping
i
knew
that
my
star
would
never
rise
again
yesterday
my
star
went
down
in
the
deep
shadows
it
went
tenderly
like
my
friend
who
loves
me
but
since
it
s
gone
the
way
shows
dark
my
two
eyes
are
tired
watching
i
know
that
my
star
will
never
rise
again
xxii
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
is
a
thing
that
will
go
far
oh
so
far
and
lose
nothing
of
itself
when
all
things
in
the
world
are
counted
the
beautiful
things
are
in
the
greatest
numbers
and
when
all
the
things
in
the
world
are
counted
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
counts
greatly
more
than
many
a
tender
soul
receives
back
no
gratitude
for
its
message
and
looks
for
no
gratitude
and
does
not
know
what
gratitude
means
and
the
tenderness
of
the
message
is
all
unmade
and
all
unknown
but
is
felt
for
long
long
years
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
goes
over
the
sea
into
the
lonesomeness
of
the
night
and
nothing
stops
it
on
the
way
for
all
know
what
it
is
and
bid
it
godspeed
and
it
goes
down
and
around
a
mountain
to
a
house
where
there
is
woe
and
if
before
it
came
that
house
had
turned
away
charity
and
love
and
friendship
and
and
peace
and
had
sent
a
curse
after
them
all
still
it
opens
wide
its
doors
for
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
for
its
coming
is
not
heralded
and
the
soul
that
sends
it
does
not
even
know
its
tenderness
and
the
hearts
of
all
in
that
house
where
there
is
woe
they
are
deeply
unknowingly
comforted
and
it
goes
upon
the
barrenness
of
a
countryside
where
there
is
not
one
green
thing
growing
and
the
barrenness
is
then
more
than
paradise
had
paradise
no
such
message
and
it
goes
where
lovely
flowers
grow
in
thousands
where
sparkling
water
mingles
with
sparkling
water
and
quenches
thirst
where
the
long
gray
moss
hangs
from
where
pale
clouds
float
and
itself
is
more
beautiful
than
all
these
have
you
felt
all
those
tender
things
that
go
down
into
the
depths
they
bring
comfort
but
also
they
bring
tears
into
the
eyes
and
pain
into
the
heart
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
what
does
it
bring
but
ineffable
comfort
to
the
heart
you
do
not
feel
that
it
is
a
message
you
do
not
feel
it
to
be
a
divinely
beautiful
thing
there
are
no
sudden
salt
tears
only
the
message
is
there
only
it
does
that
for
which
it
is
sent
have
you
gone
out
and
done
all
the
work
that
you
could
do
and
done
it
faithfully
and
asked
no
reward
and
have
you
come
back
and
cried
out
in
bitterness
of
spirit
then
it
may
be
came
wondrously
beautiful
things
from
over
the
way
to
tell
you
take
heart
but
there
was
no
take
heart
for
you
then
it
may
be
there
came
from
that
way
which
you
were
not
looking
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
then
there
was
comfort
and
with
no
tears
of
pain
and
no
bitter
bitter
tears
of
joy
there
was
deep
comfort
so
that
you
could
go
out
and
work
again
and
for
no
reward
there
is
work
that
has
no
reward
for
those
that
work
for
no
reward
there
can
be
no
comfort
in
all
the
vastness
except
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
have
you
gone
out
and
done
all
the
evil
you
could
do
in
cruel
ways
and
taken
away
faith
in
some
one
from
some
one
and
have
come
back
and
suffered
more
than
any
of
them
then
it
may
be
there
came
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
and
many
many
other
things
faded
from
your
heart
and
still
there
were
no
tears
and
if
there
is
too
much
for
you
in
living
and
if
the
countless
things
near
and
far
in
the
world
crowd
over
you
and
fill
you
with
horrible
fear
then
if
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
comes
one
by
one
they
step
backward
and
in
your
heart
is
comfort
for
the
long
long
years
there
have
been
those
that
have
had
happiness
that
was
more
than
the
world
but
in
the
end
there
was
no
comfort
for
their
happiness
brought
with
it
tears
of
joy
and
emotion
that
had
limitless
source
if
you
have
wanted
happiness
and
have
hungered
and
thirsted
after
there
came
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
you
were
content
with
a
branch
from
a
green
if
you
have
felt
a
thousand
tender
things
and
have
drunk
from
a
thousand
cups
and
then
have
been
about
to
write
it
in
black
lettering
that
all
have
failed
you
if
then
there
came
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
you
have
written
instead
that
nothing
has
failed
you
and
you
have
turned
back
your
footsteps
and
have
tried
it
all
again
if
for
you
and
me
there
should
come
over
frozen
hills
and
green
meadows
from
a
far
country
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
should
we
shiver
when
it
is
dark
and
should
we
dread
the
coming
of
the
years
and
should
we
consider
what
would
bring
weariness
and
what
would
bring
rest
and
should
we
measure
and
contemplate
but
no
for
the
message
of
a
tender
soul
is
a
message
from
one
that
has
found
the
quiet
and
is
absolutely
at
peace
and
has
gone
so
far
toward
the
stars
and
so
far
and
wide
over
the
green
earth
that
she
has
indeed
reached
the
truth
and
her
soul
gives
of
its
tenderness
without
thinking
and
without
knowing
and
all
in
the
dark
and
when
we
should
feel
the
message
all
without
knowing
there
would
come
again
that
faith
and
that
fullness
of
life
and
that
sense
of
realness
and
the
shining
of
the
sun
would
be
of
new
meaning
it
may
be
said
my
friend
annabel
lee
that
we
will
have
to
go
still
farther
into
the
wilderness
before
the
message
comes
and
it
may
be
also
that
it
will
not
come
for
many
years
but
it
is
in
all
ways
comforting
to
know
there
is
such
a
more
than
i
considered
the
message
that
might
come
i
considered
the
voice
with
no
hardness
but
with
softness
and
the
lily
face
of
my
friend
annabel
lee
xxiii
me
to
my
friend
annabel
lee
i
wrote
the
day
before
yesterday
this
letter
to
my
friend
annabel
lee
montreal
dear
fair
lady
since
i
have
come
to
stay
in
montreal
for
a
time
and
you
still
in
boston
i
have
seen
you
times
even
more
vividly
than
when
i
was
there
you
come
into
my
dreams
at
dead
of
night
can
you
imagine
what
you
are
in
my
dreams
i
look
forward
impatiently
to
the
end
of
my
time
here
so
that
i
may
go
to
find
you
again
but
my
impatience
grows
someway
less
when
i
think
that
if
i
am
with
you
this
vision
may
vanish
from
my
i
will
write
you
of
some
of
the
things
i
have
found
here
there
is
much
in
montreal
that
takes
me
back
into
the
dim
mists
the
wonderful
days
when
i
had
lived
only
three
years
it
was
not
here
but
farther
west
still
what
is
in
canada
is
canadian
and
does
not
change
nor
vary
this
canadian
land
and
water
and
air
awakens
in
my
memory
and
visions
and
voices
of
the
world
as
it
was
when
i
was
three
it
is
all
exceeding
fair
to
look
upon
about
here
the
fields
are
green
not
as
they
are
in
massachusetts
but
as
they
might
be
in
the
south
of
france
there
is
a
beautiful
broad
blue
river
that
can
be
seen
from
far
off
and
it
sends
out
a
haze
and
then
all
is
gray
french
country
and
gray
french
villages
when
you
come
near
you
see
the
french
peasants
working
in
the
fields
old
men
and
maidens
and
very
old
women
all
with
no
english
words
in
their
mouths
and
no
english
thing
in
their
lives
if
they
can
avoid
it
they
wear
brass
rings
on
their
hands
and
in
their
ears
and
the
women
wear
petticoats
and
in
all
their
faces
and
eyes
is
that
look
that
comes
from
working
always
among
vegetables
in
the
sun
the
look
of
a
piteous
useless
brain
and
there
is
the
strange
long
hill
that
they
call
mount
royal
i
have
in
my
mind
a
picture
of
it
in
a
bygone
century
when
an
adventurous
brave
frenchman
and
a
few
indians
of
the
wild
stood
high
at
its
summit
he
with
the
french
flag
unfurled
in
the
wind
and
the
indians
shading
their
eyes
and
looking
off
and
down
into
the
valley
and
there
was
not
one
sign
of
human
life
in
the
valley
and
all
was
wild
growth
and
tangled
underbrush
and
silence
except
maybe
for
the
sound
of
flying
wild
hoofs
in
the
forest
and
now
this
hill
is
the
of
many
things
hidden
among
the
trees
convents
set
about
with
tall
thick
solid
stone
walls
and
inside
the
walls
are
nuns
who
have
said
their
farewell
to
all
things
without
and
there
are
hospitals
founded
and
endowed
in
the
name
of
the
virgin
and
jesuit
colleges
and
the
lodges
of
priests
and
brotherhoods
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lawrence
valley
where
the
indians
looked
down
is
this
old
city
and
in
the
place
d
armes
square
is
a
fine
triumphant
statue
of
maisonneuve
with
his
french
flag
this
city
is
builded
thick
with
cathedrals
and
some
of
them
are
very
fine
and
some
of
them
are
as
rainbows
inside
and
all
of
them
are
roman
catholic
and
french
the
protestant
churches
are
but
churches
and
the
notre
dame
cathedral
when
the
setting
sun
touches
its
great
tall
gray
twin
towers
with
red
is
even
more
than
french
and
roman
catholic
the
women
in
the
nunnery
at
the
side
of
it
must
need
have
a
likeness
of
those
eternal
towers
graven
on
their
narrow
devout
hearts
within
the
notre
dame
is
most
gorgeous
with
saints
and
virgins
and
a
passion
of
wealth
and
romanism
and
is
it
not
wonderful
to
think
that
many
of
these
buildings
and
dwellings
were
here
in
the
sixteen
hundreds
and
that
gray
nuns
walked
in
these
same
green
gardens
two
centuries
ago
and
the
same
country
was
about
here
and
the
same
blue
water
and
when
all
is
said
the
country
and
the
blue
water
have
been
here
always
and
are
the
most
wonderful
things
of
all
if
the
buildings
were
of
yellow
gold
and
of
emeralds
and
brilliants
the
green
country
would
be
no
fairer
and
no
less
exquisitely
fair
and
the
blue
of
the
water
would
go
no
deeper
into
the
heart
and
no
less
deep
and
the
pale
clouds
would
float
high
and
gently
with
the
same
mystery
and
the
centuries
they
know
are
countless
the
natural
things
are
the
same
in
massachusetts
but
here
they
seem
someway
even
older
you
feel
the
breath
of
the
very
among
the
wildness
of
green
as
if
only
human
beings
had
come
and
gone
but
it
had
never
changed
its
smallest
twig
or
it
seems
but
waiting
and
its
patience
in
the
waiting
is
without
end
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
i
have
seen
a
flat
country
road
with
the
sunshine
upon
it
and
a
few
little
english
sparrows
alighting
and
flying
along
it
and
picking
at
grains
and
the
grass
by
the
was
tall
and
rank
and
sweet
to
the
senses
and
the
road
led
to
farms
and
the
river
and
the
wildwood
cows
were
feeding
by
a
shallow
brook
and
there
were
sumach
bushes
thick
and
dark
near
by
for
several
minutes
when
my
eyes
rested
upon
this
i
felt
absolutely
content
with
all
of
life
while
i
m
telling
you
this
annabel
lee
i
am
not
quite
sure
you
are
listening
and
for
myself
i
see
much
more
than
anything
i
have
talked
about
i
am
wondering
how
it
is
possible
that
you
have
lived
only
fourteen
years
even
the
fourteen
years
of
a
japanese
woman
and
i
see
again
in
my
mind
your
red
lips
and
your
hair
and
your
purple
eyes
and
your
wonderful
hands
and
your
forehead
with
the
widow
s
peak
and
the
two
short
that
curve
around
and
your
slimness
in
the
scarlet
and
gown
and
most
of
all
i
see
your
eyes
when
they
are
full
of
soft
purple
shadows
and
your
lips
when
they
are
tender
and
your
heart
as
i
have
seen
it
before
and
its
depths
which
are
of
the
white
purity
last
night
there
was
the
vision
of
you
with
your
purple
eyes
wide
and
gazing
down
at
me
with
the
white
lids
still
and
i
was
at
the
look
of
in
them
how
that
it
is
terrible
how
that
it
follows
one
into
the
darkness
and
light
how
that
it
is
grief
and
rage
and
madness
how
that
it
makes
the
heart
ache
until
all
the
ache
with
it
and
there
is
no
end
how
that
it
is
life
and
death
and
one
can
not
escape
a
world
of
tears
and
entreating
and
vows
but
no
there
is
no
escape
and
then
again
i
looked
up
at
your
purple
eyes
gazing
down
at
me
full
of
strong
high
scorn
and
triumph
do
you
think
we
have
not
conquered
life
they
said
do
you
think
we
can
not
crush
out
all
the
little
demons
that
presume
to
torture
do
you
think
we
can
not
conquer
who
is
there
that
we
have
not
known
where
is
there
that
we
have
not
been
are
there
any
still
still
shadows
that
we
have
cringed
before
are
there
any
brilliant
lights
upon
the
sky
that
we
have
not
faced
boldly
and
put
aside
and
the
stones
and
the
stars
and
the
mists
on
the
sea
are
less
less
than
we
are
the
greatest
things
of
thus
your
two
eyes
when
i
slept
and
when
i
woke
i
saw
you
again
as
you
have
looked
so
many
times
the
expression
of
your
red
lips
and
your
voice
with
vague
bitterness
and
your
lily
face
inscrutable
i
shall
see
you
so
again
many
times
my
friend
annabel
the
fact
remains
that
i
am
in
montreal
and
canada
and
as
the
days
run
along
i
am
reminded
that
i
have
in
me
the
old
canadian
instincts
the
word
canadian
has
always
called
up
in
my
mind
a
confused
throng
of
things
like
porridge
for
tea
and
sir
hugh
macdonald
and
dominion
day
and
my
aunt
elizabeth
maclane
and
pictures
of
her
majesty
the
queen
and
orangemen
s
day
and
for
and
reel
of
cotton
for
spool
of
thread
and
tin
instead
of
can
and
canadian
cheese
and
in
a
patent
pail
and
the
queen
s
own
in
toronto
and
soldiers
in
red
coats
and
children
in
scotch
kilts
and
and
and
whitefish
from
lake
winnipeg
and
the
and
the
parliament
at
ottawa
and
coasting
in
toboggans
and
lord
aberdeen
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
my
mind
has
always
had
a
color
for
canada
a
shade
of
mingled
deep
green
and
golden
brown
even
in
montreal
where
so
much
is
french
there
is
enough
to
stamp
it
as
beyond
question
canadian
one
still
sees
marks
of
her
majesty
the
queen
but
assert
confidently
that
edward
is
going
to
make
a
good
king
and
canadian
men
are
made
up
as
nearly
as
possible
after
his
pattern
stout
and
with
that
short
pointed
beard
in
the
greenness
of
dominion
square
is
the
most
beautiful
piece
of
sculpture
i
have
seen
all
the
statues
that
stand
about
in
montreal
are
finer
than
most
of
their
kind
and
there
are
no
such
hideous
creations
as
are
set
up
in
boston
and
new
york
the
dominion
square
statue
is
a
bronze
figure
of
a
sir
john
macdonald
the
face
of
the
figure
is
all
that
is
serene
and
benign
and
the
lines
of
the
body
and
of
the
hands
are
made
with
strength
and
beauty
whether
it
is
like
sir
john
macdonald
one
does
not
know
tis
enough
that
it
s
an
exquisite
piece
of
workmanship
with
which
to
adorn
a
city
and
the
maisonneuve
statue
is
a
fine
handsome
thing
and
is
altogether
alive
the
bronze
is
no
bronze
but
has
red
blood
in
its
veins
and
the
arm
that
is
held
high
and
the
hand
with
the
flag
mean
conquest
and
victory
i
shall
see
quebec
and
the
length
of
the
blue
river
before
i
see
you
again
and
they
like
montreal
will
be
mingled
with
a
to
being
with
you
again
high
upon
the
tower
of
a
building
that
i
see
from
my
window
is
a
carved
gorgon
s
head
a
likeness
of
medusa
with
snaky
locks
she
is
hundreds
of
feet
above
me
as
i
sit
here
but
i
see
the
expression
of
her
face
plainly
it
is
desolate
and
discouraging
it
says
do
you
think
you
will
see
that
fair
lily
annabel
lee
again
well
then
how
foolish
are
you
in
your
day
and
generation
i
in
my
years
have
seen
the
passing
of
many
fair
lilies
always
they
tell
me
annabel
lee
always
do
they
pass
but
no
i
shall
find
you
again
you
will
make
all
things
for
a
thousand
thousands
of
gold
days
and
are
we
not
good
friends
in
way
and
manner
and
do
we
not
go
the
together
but
i
wonder
always
why
the
gorgon
seems
so
fearfully
always
my
love
to
you

maclane
xxiv
my
friend
annabel
lee
to
me
and
after
some
days
my
friend
annabel
lee
wrote
me
this
upon
a
square
of
rice
paper
boston
monday
dear
mary
maclane
don
t
you
know
a
gorgon
is
the
knowingest
thing
in
the
land
you
may
believe
what
your
friend
says
of
fair
lilies
but
have
i
ever
said
that
i
am
a
fair
lily
as
for
my
eyes
they
are
good
chiefly
to
see
with
and
they
are
bad
for
many
things
yes
get
thee
home
soon
child
i
miss
you
when
i
come
to
deck
me
mornings
with
my
lavender
slip
and
my
scarlet
frock
and
the
gold
marguerites
have
not
been
brushed
since
you
went
away
naught
have
i
to
bear
me
company
except
ellen
the
faithful
little
tan
deer
and
she
can
not
wait
upon
me
and
she
can
not
worship
me
what
hast
done
with
martha
goneril
the
cat
i
would
fain
you
had
left
her
here
but
mary
maclane
do
you
know
about
it
your
friend
annabel
lee
xxv
the
golden
ripple
my
friend
annabel
lee
and
i
are
similar
to
each
other
in
a
few
few
ways
daily
we
contemplate
together
a
great
blank
wall
built
up
of
dull
blue
stones
it
stands
before
us
and
we
can
not
get
over
it
for
it
is
too
high
neither
can
we
walk
around
it
for
it
is
too
long
and
we
can
not
go
through
it
for
it
is
solid
and
very
thick
it
is
directly
across
the
road
we
have
both
come
but
a
short
way
on
the
road
so
short
that
we
can
easily
look
back
over
our
course
to
the
point
where
we
started
we
did
not
walk
together
from
there
but
we
have
met
each
other
now
before
the
great
blank
wall
of
blue
stones
we
have
stopped
here
for
we
can
not
go
on
i
wonder
and
conjecture
much
about
the
wall
and
my
friend
annabel
lee
regards
it
sometimes
with
interest
and
sometimes
with
none
and
times
we
forget
all
about
the
wall
and
merely
sit
and
rest
in
the
shade
it
casts
or
walk
back
on
the
road
or
in
the
grass
about
it
or
pluck
a
few
wild
sweet
berries
from
the
stunted
wayside
briers
and
too
when
a
thunder
storm
comes
up
and
the
air
is
full
of
wind
and
rain
slanting
and
whistling
about
us
we
crouch
close
against
the
base
of
the
wall
and
we
do
not
become
so
wet
as
we
should
were
there
no
wall
but
that
is
only
when
the
wind
is
from
beyond
it
when
the
wind
with
its
flood
of
rain
comes
toward
us
as
we
crouch
by
the
wall
we
are
beaten
and
drenched
and
buffeted
and
driven
hard
against
that
cold
blue
surface
and
the
ragged
edges
of
the
rocks
make
bruises
on
our
foreheads
some
days
we
become
exceeding
weary
with
looking
at
the
great
blank
wall
and
with
having
looked
at
it
already
for
many
a
day
and
many
a
day
it
is
so
high
and
so
thick
i
say
it
is
so
long
says
my
friend
annabel
lee
to
all
appearances
we
have
gone
as
far
upon
the
road
as
we
ever
can
go
we
can
not
get
over
the
wall
of
blue
stones
and
we
can
not
walk
round
and
we
can
not
go
through
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
will
ever
be
removed
the
field
for
conjecture
as
to
what
lies
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
is
so
vast
that
we
do
not
venture
to
conjecture
but
we
have
talked
often
and
madly
of
the
wall
itself
perhaps
i
say
it
is
that
the
wall
is
placed
here
before
our
eyes
to
hide
from
us
our
perhaps
says
my
friend
annabel
lee
it
is
that
the
wall
itself
is
our
which
if
it
is
true
is
very
damnable
for
though
human
beings
have
done
some
divine
things
they
have
never
gone
beyond
their
limitations
the
blue
of
the
stones
in
the
wall
is
not
a
dark
blue
but
it
is
very
cold
it
is
the
color
that
is
called
stone
blue
it
never
changes
the
sun
and
the
shade
look
alike
upon
it
and
the
wet
rain
does
not
brighten
it
neither
do
thick
clouds
of
dust
make
it
dull
it
is
stone
blue
except
for
this
once
in
a
number
of
days
in
fair
weather
or
foul
there
will
come
upon
the
wide
blankness
a
rippling
like
gold
it
lingers
a
second
and
vanishes
and
appears
again
and
then
it
s
gone
until
another
time
how
tender
how
lovely
how
bright
is
the
golden
ripple
against
the
cold
cold
blue
it
is
come
and
gone
in
a
minute
we
do
not
know
its
coming
or
its
going
but
while
we
see
it
our
hearts
beat
high
and
fast
it
may
be
i
say
when
it
is
gone
that
this
golden
ripple
will
show
us
some
way
to
get
beyond
the
wall
where
things
are
it
may
be
says
my
friend
annabel
lee
that
the
golden
ripple
will
show
us
something
divine
among
these
few
things
on
this
side
of
the
friend
annabel
lee
with
your
strong
brave
little
heart
and
your
two
strong
little
hands
you
were

me
in

bitter

you
were

enough
