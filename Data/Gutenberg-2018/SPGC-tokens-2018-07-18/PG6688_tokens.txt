outside

a
wide
plain
where
the
broadening
floss
hurries
on
between
its
green
banks
to
the
sea
and
the
loving
tide
rushing
to

it
checks

with

embrace
on
this
mighty
tide
the
black
ships
laden
with
the
with
rounded
sacks
of

or
with
the
dark
glitter
of
coal
are
borne
along
to
the
town
of
ogg
which
shows
its
aged
fluted
red
roofs
and
the
broad
gables
of
its
wharves
between
the
low
wooded
hill
and
the
tingeing
the
water
with
a
soft
purple
hue
under
the
transient
glance
of
this
february
sun
far
away
on
each
hand
stretch
the
rich
pastures
and
the
patches
of
dark
earth
made
ready
for
the
seed
of
green
crops
or
touched
already
with
the
tint
of
the
corn
there
is
a
remnant
still
of
last
year
golden
clusters
of
rising
at
intervals
beyond
the
hedgerows
and
everywhere
the
hedgerows
are
studded
with
trees
the
distant
ships
seem
to
be
lifting
their
masts
and
stretching
their
sails
close
among
the
branches
of
the
spreading
ash
just
by
the
town
the
tributary
ripple
flows
with
a
lively
current
into
the
floss
how
lovely
the
little
river
is
with
its
dark
changing
wavelets
it
seems
to
me
like
a
living
companion
while
i
wander
along
the
bank
and
listen
to
its
low
placid
voice
as
to
the
voice
of
one
who
is
deaf
and
loving
i
remember
those
large
dipping
willows
i
remember
the
stone
bridge
and
this
is
dorlcote
mill
i
must
stand
a
minute
or
two
here
on
the
bridge
and
look
at
it
though
the
clouds
are
threatening
and
it
is
far
on
in
the
afternoon
even
in
this
leafless
time
of
departing
february
it
is
pleasant
to
look
at
perhaps
the
chill
damp
season
adds
a
charm
to
the
trimly
kept
comfortable
as
old
as
the
elms
and
chestnuts
that
shelter
it
from
the
northern
blast
the
stream
is
brimful
now
and
lies
high
in
this
little
withy
plantation
and
half
drowns
the
grassy
fringe
of
the
croft
in
front
of
the
house
as
i
look
at
the
full
stream
the
vivid
grass
the
delicate
powder
softening
the
outline
of
the
great
trunks
and
branches
that
gleam
from
under
the
bare
purple
boughs
i
am
in
love
with
moistness
and
envy
the
white
ducks
that
are
dipping
their
heads
far
into
the
water
here
among
the
withes
unmindful
of
the
awkward
appearance
they
make
in
the
drier
world
above
the
rush
of
the
water
and
the
booming
of
the
mill
bring
a
dreamy
deafness
which
seems
to
heighten
the
peacefulness
of
the
scene
they
are
like
a
great
curtain
of
sound
shutting
one
out
from
the
world
beyond
and
now
there
is
the
thunder
of
the
huge
covered
wagon
coming
home
with
sacks
of
grain
that
honest
wagoner
is
thinking
of
his
dinner
getting
sadly
dry
in
the
oven
at
this
late
hour
but
he
will
not
touch
it
till
he
has
fed
his
horses
the
strong
submissive
beasts
who
i
fancy
are
looking
mild
reproach
at
him
from
between
their
blinkers
that
he
should
crack
his
whip
at
them
in
that
awful
manner
as
if
they
needed
that
hint
see
how
they
stretch
their
shoulders
up
the
slope
toward
the
bridge
with
all
the
more
energy
because
they
are
so
near
home
look
at
their
grand
shaggy
feet
that
seem
to
grasp
the
firm
earth
at
the
patient
strength
of
their
necks
bowed
under
the
heavy
collar
at
the
mighty
muscles
of
their
struggling
haunches
i
should
like
well
to
hear
them
neigh
over
their
hardly
earned
feed
of
corn
and
see
them
with
their
moist
necks
freed
from
the
harness
dipping
their
eager
nostrils
into
the
muddy
pond
now
they
are
on
the
bridge
and
down
they
go
again
at
a
swifter
pace
and
the
arch
of
the
covered
wagon
disappears
at
the
turning
behind
the
trees
now
i
can
turn
my
eyes
toward
the
mill
again
and
watch
the
unresting
wheel
sending
out
its
diamond
jets
of
water
that
little
girl
is
watching
it
too
she
has
been
standing
on
just
the
same
spot
at
the
edge
of
the
water
ever
since
i
paused
on
the
bridge
and
that
queer
white
cur
with
the
brown
ear
seems
to
be
leaping
and
barking
in
ineffectual
remonstrance
with
the
wheel
perhaps
he
is
jealous
because
his
playfellow
in
the
beaver
bonnet
is
so
rapt
in
its
movement
it
is
time
the
little
playfellow
went
in
i
think
and
there
is
a
very
bright
fire
to
tempt
her
the
red
light
shines
out
under
the
deepening
gray
of
the
sky
it
is
time
too
for
me
to
leave
off
resting
my
arms
on
the
cold
stone
of
this
bridge
ah
my
arms
are
really
benumbed
i
have
been
pressing
my
elbows
on
the
arms
of
my
chair
and
dreaming
that
i
was
standing
on
the
bridge
in
front
of
dorlcote
mill
as
it
looked
one
february
afternoon
many
years
ago
before
i
dozed
off
i
was
going
to
tell
you
what
and
tulliver
were
talking
about
as
they
sat
by
the
bright
fire
in
the
parlor
on
that
very
afternoon
i
have
been
dreaming
of
chapter
ii
tulliver
of
dorlcote
mill
declares
his
resolution
about
tom
what
i
want
you
know
said
tulliver
what
i
want
is
to
give
tom
a
good
eddication
an
eddication
as
be
a
bread
to
him
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
of
when
i
gave
notice
for
him
to
leave
the
academy
at
i
mean
to
put
him
to
a
downright
good
school
at
midsummer
the
two
years
at
th
academy
ha
done
well
enough
if
i
meant
to
make
a
miller
and
farmer
of
him
for
he
had
a
fine
sight
more
schoolin
nor
ever
got
all
the
learnin
father
ever
paid
for
was
a
bit
o
birch
at
one
end
and
the
alphabet
at
other
but
i
should
like
tom
to
be
a
bit
of
a
scholard
so
as
he
might
be
up
to
the
tricks
o
these
fellows
as
talk
fine
and
write
with
a
flourish
it
be
a
help
to
me
wi
these
lawsuits
and
arbitrations
and
things
i
would
make
a
downright
lawyer
o
the
lad
i
should
be
sorry
for
him
to
be
a
raskill
but
a
sort
o
engineer
or
a
surveyor
or
an
auctioneer
and
vallyer
like
riley
or
one
o
them
smartish
businesses
as
are
all
profits
and
no
outlay
only
for
a
big
and
a
high
stool
they
pretty
nigh
all
one
and
not
far
off
being
even
wi
the
law
believe
for
riley
looks
lawyer
wakem
i
the
face
as
hard
as
one
cat
looks
another
none
frightened
at
him
tulliver
was
speaking
to
his
wife
a
blond
comely
woman
in
a
cap
i
am
afraid
to
think
how
long
it
is
since
caps
were
worn
they
must
be
so
near
coming
in
again
at
that
time
when
tulliver
was
nearly
forty
they
were
new
at
ogg
and
considered
sweet
things
well
tulliver
you
know
best
no
objections
but
had
i
better
kill
a
couple
o
fowl
and
have
th
aunts
and
uncles
to
dinner
next
week
so
as
you
may
hear
what
sister
glegg
and
sister
pullet
have
got
to
say
about
it
there
a
couple
o
fowl
killing
you
may
kill
every
fowl
i
the
yard
if
you
like
bessy
but
i
shall
ask
neither
aunt
nor
uncle
what
i
to
do
wi
my
own
lad
said
tulliver
defiantly
dear
heart
said
tulliver
shocked
at
this
sanguinary
rhetoric
how
can
you
talk
so
tulliver
but
it
your
way
to
speak
disrespectful
o
my
family
and
sister
glegg
throws
all
the
blame
upo
me
though
i
sure
i
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
for
nobody
ever
heard
me
say
as
it
was
lucky
for
my
children
to
have
aunts
and
uncles
as
can
live
independent
howiver
if
tom
to
go
to
a
new
school
i
should
like
him
to
go
where
i
can
wash
him
and
mend
him
else
he
might
as
well
have
calico
as
linen
for
they
be
one
as
yallow
as
th
other
before
they
been
washed
times
and
then
when
the
box
is
goin
and
forrard
i
could
send
the
lad
a
cake
or
a
or
an
apple
for
he
can
do
with
an
extry
bit
bless
him
whether
they
stint
him
at
the
meals
or
no
my
children
can
eat
as
much
victuals
as
most
thank
god
well
well
we
wo
send
him
out
o
reach
o
the
carrier
cart
if
other
things
fit
in
said
tulliver
but
you
must
put
a
spoke
i
the
wheel
about
the
washin
if
we
ca
get
a
school
near
enough
that
the
fault
i
have
to
find
wi
you
bessy
if
you
see
a
stick
the
road
you
allays
thinkin
you
ca
step
over
it
you
want
me
not
to
hire
a
good
wagoner
he
got
a
mole
on
his
face
dear
heart
said
tulliver
in
mild
surprise
when
did
i
iver
make
objections
to
a
man
because
he
got
a
mole
on
his
face
i
sure
i
rether
fond
o
the
moles
for
my
brother
as
is
dead
an
gone
had
a
mole
on
his
brow
but
i
ca
remember
your
iver
offering
to
hire
a
wagoner
with
a
mole
tulliver
there
was
john
gibbs
had
a
mole
on
his
face
no
more
nor
you
have
an
i
was
all
for
having
you
hire
an
so
you
did
hire
him
an
if
he
had
died
o
inflammation
as
we
paid
turnbull
for
attending
him
he
very
like
ha
been
drivin
the
wagon
now
he
might
have
a
mole
somewhere
out
o
sight
but
how
was
i
to
know
that
mr
tulliver
no
no
bessy
i
did
mean
justly
the
mole
i
meant
it
to
stand
for
summat
else
but
niver
mind
it
puzzling
work
talking
is
what
thinking
on
is
how
to
find
the
right
sort
o
school
to
send
tom
to
for
i
might
be
in
again
as
i
been
wi
th
academy
i
have
nothing
to
do
wi
a
again
whativer
school
i
send
tom
to
it
be
a
it
shall
be
a
place
where
the
lads
spend
their
time
i
summat
else
besides
blacking
the
family
shoes
and
getting
up
the
potatoes
it
an
uncommon
puzzling
thing
to
know
what
school
to
pick
tulliver
paused
a
minute
or
two
and
dived
with
both
hands
into
his
breeches
pockets
as
if
he
hoped
to
find
some
suggestion
there
apparently
he
was
not
disappointed
for
he
presently
said
i
know
what
i
do
i
talk
it
over
wi
riley
he
coming
arbitrate
about
the
dam
well
tulliver
i
put
the
sheets
out
for
the
best
bed
and
kezia
got
hanging
at
the
fire
they
are
the
best
sheets
but
they
good
enough
for
anybody
to
sleep
in
be
he
who
he
will
for
as
for
them
best
holland
sheets
i
should
repent
buying
only
do
to
lay
us
out
in
an
if
you
was
to
die
tulliver
they
mangled
beautiful
an
all
ready
an
smell
o
lavender
as
it
be
a
pleasure
to
lay
out
an
they
lie
at
the
corner
o
the
big
oak
at
the
back
not
as
i
should
trust
anybody
to
look
out
but
myself
as
tulliver
uttered
the
last
sentence
she
drew
a
bright
bunch
of
keys
from
her
pocket
and
singled
out
one
rubbing
her
thumb
and
finger
up
and
down
it
with
a
placid
smile
while
she
looked
at
the
clear
fire
if
tulliver
had
been
a
susceptible
man
in
his
conjugal
relation
he
might
have
supposed
that
she
drew
out
the
key
to
aid
her
imagination
in
anticipating
the
moment
when
he
would
be
in
a
state
to
justify
the
production
of
the
best
holland
sheets
happily
he
was
not
so
he
was
only
susceptible
in
respect
of
his
right
to
moreover
he
had
the
marital
habit
of
not
listening
very
closely
and
since
his
mention
of
riley
had
been
apparently
occupied
in
a
tactile
examination
of
his
woollen
stockings
i
think
i
hit
it
bessy
was
his
first
remark
after
a
short
silence
riley
as
likely
a
man
as
any
to
know
o
some
school
had
schooling
himself
an
goes
about
to
all
sorts
o
places
arbitratin
and
vallyin
and
that
and
we
shall
have
time
to
talk
it
over
night
when
the
business
is
done
i
want
tom
to
be
such
a
sort
o
man
as
riley
you
know
as
can
talk
pretty
nigh
as
well
as
if
it
was
all
wrote
out
for
him
and
knows
a
good
lot
o
words
as
do
mean
much
so
as
you
ca
lay
hold
of
i
law
and
a
good
solid
knowledge
o
business
too
well
said
tulliver
so
far
as
talking
proper
and
knowing
everything
and
walking
with
a
bend
in
his
back
and
setting
his
hair
up
i
should
mind
the
lad
being
brought
up
to
that
but
them
men
from
the
big
towns
mostly
wear
the
false
they
wear
a
frill
till
it
all
a
mess
and
then
hide
it
with
a
bib
i
know
riley
does
and
then
if
tom
to
go
and
live
at
mudport
like
riley
he
have
a
house
with
a
kitchen
hardly
big
enough
to
turn
in
an
niver
get
a
fresh
egg
for
his
breakfast
sleep
up
three
pair
o
stairs
or
four
for
what
i
know
and
be
burnt
to
death
before
he
can
get
down
no
no
said
tulliver
i
no
thoughts
of
his
going
to
mudport
i
mean
him
to
set
up
his
office
at
ogg
close
by
us
an
live
at
home
but
continued
tulliver
after
a
pause
what
i
a
bit
afraid
on
is
as
tom
has
got
the
right
sort
o
brains
for
a
smart
fellow
i
doubt
he
a
bit
slowish
he
takes
after
your
family
bessy
yes
that
he
does
said
tulliver
accepting
the
last
proposition
entirely
on
its
own
merits
he
wonderful
for
liking
a
deal
o
salt
in
his
broth
that
was
my
brother
way
and
my
before
him
it
seems
a
bit
a
pity
though
said
tulliver
as
the
lad
should
take
after
the
mother
side
instead
o
the
little
wench
that
the
worst
o
wi
crossing
o
breeds
you
can
never
justly
calkilate
what
come
o
the
little
un
takes
after
my
side
now
she
twice
as
as
tom
too
for
a
woman
i
afraid
continued
tulliver
turning
his
head
dubiously
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
it
no
mischief
much
while
she
a
little
un
but
an
woman
no
better
nor
a
sheep
she
fetch
none
the
bigger
price
for
that
yes
it
a
mischief
while
she
a
little
un
tulliver
for
it
runs
to
naughtiness
how
to
keep
her
in
a
clean
pinafore
two
hours
together
passes
my
cunning
an
now
you
put
me
i
mind
continued
tulliver
rising
and
going
to
the
window
i
do
know
where
she
is
now
an
it
pretty
nigh
ah
i
thought
so
wanderin
up
an
down
by
the
water
like
a
wild
thing
she
tumble
in
some
day
tulliver
rapped
the
window
sharply
beckoned
and
shook
her
head
a
process
which
she
repeated
more
than
once
before
she
returned
to
her
chair
you
talk
o
tulliver
she
observed
as
she
sat
down
but
i
sure
the
child
half
an
idiot
i
some
things
for
if
i
send
her
upstairs
to
fetch
anything
she
forgets
what
she
gone
for
perhaps
sit
down
on
the
floor
i
the
sunshine
an
plait
her
hair
an
sing
to
herself
like
a
bedlam
creatur
all
the
while
i
waiting
for
her
downstairs
that
niver
run
i
my
family
thank
god
no
more
nor
a
brown
skin
as
makes
her
look
like
a
mulatter
i
do
like
to
fly
i
the
face
o
providence
but
it
seems
hard
as
i
should
have
but
one
gell
an
her
so
comical
pooh
nonsense
said
tulliver
she
a
straight
wench
as
anybody
need
wish
to
see
i
do
know
i
what
she
behind
other
folks
children
and
she
can
read
almost
as
well
as
the
parson
but
her
hair
wo
curl
all
i
can
do
with
it
and
she
so
franzy
about
having
it
put
i
paper
and
i
such
work
as
never
was
to
make
her
stand
and
have
it
pinched
with
th
irons
cut
it
off
cut
it
off
short
said
the
father
rashly
how
can
you
talk
so
tulliver
she
too
big
a
gell
gone
nine
and
tall
of
her
age
to
have
her
hair
cut
short
an
there
her
cousin
lucy
got
a
row
o
curls
round
her
head
an
not
a
hair
out
place
it
seems
hard
as
my
sister
deane
should
have
that
pretty
child
i
sure
lucy
takes
more
after
me
nor
my
own
child
does
maggie
maggie
continued
the
mother
in
a
tone
of
fretfulness
as
this
small
mistake
of
nature
entered
the
room
where
the
use
my
telling
you
to
keep
away
from
the
water
you
tumble
in
and
be
drownded
some
day
an
then
you
be
sorry
you
did
do
as
mother
told
you
maggie
hair
as
she
threw
off
her
bonnet
painfully
confirmed
her
mother
accusation
tulliver
desiring
her
daughter
to
have
a
curled
crop
like
other
folks
children
had
had
it
cut
too
short
in
front
to
be
pushed
behind
the
ears
and
as
it
was
usually
straight
an
hour
after
it
had
been
taken
out
of
paper
maggie
was
incessantly
tossing
her
head
to
keep
the
dark
heavy
locks
out
of
her
gleaming
black
eyes
an
action
which
gave
her
very
much
the
air
of
a
small
shetland
pony
oh
dear
oh
dear
maggie
what
are
you
thinkin
of
to
throw
your
bonnet
down
there
take
it
upstairs
there
a
good
gell
an
let
your
hair
be
brushed
an
put
your
other
pinafore
on
an
change
your
shoes
do
for
shame
an
come
an
go
on
with
your
patchwork
like
a
little
lady
oh
mother
said
maggie
in
a
vehemently
cross
tone
i
do
to
do
my
patchwork
what
not
your
pretty
patchwork
to
make
a
counterpane
for
your
aunt
glegg
it
foolish
work
said
maggie
with
a
toss
of
her
mane
tearing
things
to
pieces
to
sew
together
again
and
i
do
want
to
do
anything
for
my
aunt
glegg
i
do
like
her
exit
maggie
dragging
her
bonnet
by
the
string
while
tulliver
laughs
audibly
i
wonder
at
you
as
you
laugh
at
her
tulliver
said
the
mother
with
feeble
fretfulness
in
her
tone
you
encourage
her
naughtiness
an
her
aunts
will
have
it
as
it
me
spoils
her
tulliver
was
what
is
called
a
person
never
cried
when
she
was
a
baby
on
any
slighter
ground
than
hunger
and
pins
and
from
the
cradle
upward
had
been
healthy
fair
plump
and
in
short
the
flower
of
her
family
for
beauty
and
amiability
but
milk
and
mildness
are
not
the
best
things
for
keeping
and
when
they
turn
only
a
little
sour
they
may
disagree
with
young
stomachs
seriously
i
have
often
wondered
whether
those
early
madonnas
of
raphael
with
the
blond
faces
and
somewhat
stupid
expression
kept
their
placidity
undisturbed
when
their
boys
got
a
little
too
old
to
do
without
clothing
i
think
they
must
have
been
given
to
feeble
remonstrance
getting
more
and
more
peevish
as
it
became
more
and
more
ineffectual
chapter
iii
riley
gives
his
advice
concerning
a
school
for
tom
the
gentleman
in
the
ample
white
cravat
and
taking
his
so
pleasantly
with
his
good
friend
tulliver
is
riley
a
gentleman
with
a
waxen
complexion
and
fat
hands
rather
highly
educated
for
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
but
enough
to
show
a
great
deal
of
toward
simple
country
acquaintances
of
hospitable
habits
riley
spoke
of
such
acquaintances
kindly
as
people
of
the
old
school
the
conversation
had
come
to
a
pause
tulliver
not
without
a
particular
reason
had
abstained
from
a
seventh
recital
of
the
cool
retort
by
which
riley
had
shown
himself
too
many
for
dix
and
how
wakem
had
had
his
comb
cut
for
once
in
his
life
now
the
business
of
the
dam
had
been
settled
by
arbitration
and
how
there
never
would
have
been
any
dispute
at
all
about
the
height
of
water
if
everybody
was
what
they
should
be
and
old
harry
had
made
the
lawyers
tulliver
was
on
the
whole
a
man
of
safe
traditional
opinions
but
on
one
or
two
points
he
had
trusted
to
his
unassisted
intellect
and
had
arrived
at
several
questionable
conclusions
amongst
the
rest
that
rats
weevils
and
lawyers
were
created
by
old
harry
unhappily
he
had
no
one
to
tell
him
that
this
was
rampant
manichæism
else
he
might
have
seen
his
error
but
it
was
clear
that
the
good
principle
was
triumphant
this
affair
of
the
had
been
a
tangled
business
somehow
for
all
it
seemed
look
at
it
one
way
as
plain
as
water
water
but
big
a
puzzle
as
it
was
it
had
got
the
better
of
riley
tulliver
took
his
a
little
stronger
than
usual
and
for
a
man
who
might
be
supposed
to
have
a
few
hundreds
lying
idle
at
his
banker
was
rather
incautiously
open
in
expressing
his
high
estimate
of
his
friend
business
talents
but
the
dam
was
a
subject
of
conversation
that
would
keep
it
could
always
be
taken
up
again
at
the
same
point
and
exactly
in
the
same
condition
and
there
was
another
subject
as
you
know
on
which
tulliver
was
in
pressing
want
of
riley
advice
this
was
his
particular
reason
for
remaining
silent
for
a
short
space
after
his
last
draught
and
rubbing
his
knees
in
a
meditative
manner
he
was
not
a
man
to
make
an
abrupt
transition
this
was
a
puzzling
world
as
he
often
said
and
if
you
drive
your
wagon
in
a
hurry
you
may
light
on
an
awkward
corner
riley
meanwhile
was
not
impatient
why
should
he
be
even
hotspur
one
would
think
must
have
been
patient
in
his
slippers
on
a
warm
hearth
taking
copious
snuff
and
sipping
gratuitous
there
a
thing
i
got
i
my
head
said
tulliver
at
last
in
rather
a
lower
tone
than
usual
as
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
steadfastly
at
his
companion
ah
said
riley
in
a
tone
of
mild
interest
he
was
a
man
with
heavy
waxen
eyelids
and
eyebrows
looking
exactly
the
same
under
all
circumstances
this
immovability
of
face
and
the
habit
of
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
gave
an
answer
made
him
trebly
oracular
to
tulliver
it
a
very
particular
thing
he
went
on
it
about
my
boy
tom
at
the
sound
of
this
name
maggie
who
was
seated
on
a
low
stool
close
by
the
fire
with
a
large
book
open
on
her
lap
shook
her
heavy
hair
back
and
looked
up
eagerly
there
were
few
sounds
that
roused
maggie
when
she
was
dreaming
over
her
book
but
tom
name
served
as
well
as
the
shrillest
whistle
in
an
instant
she
was
on
the
watch
with
gleaming
eyes
like
a
skye
terrier
suspecting
mischief
or
at
all
events
determined
to
fly
at
any
one
who
threatened
it
toward
tom
you
see
i
want
to
put
him
to
a
new
school
at
midsummer
said
tulliver
he
comin
away
from
the
at
an
i
shall
let
him
run
loose
for
a
quarter
but
after
that
i
want
to
send
him
to
a
downright
good
school
where
they
make
a
scholard
of
him
well
said
riley
there
no
greater
advantage
you
can
give
him
than
a
good
education
not
he
added
with
polite
significance
not
that
a
man
ca
be
an
excellent
miller
and
farmer
and
a
shrewd
sensible
fellow
into
the
bargain
without
much
help
from
the
schoolmaster
i
believe
you
said
tulliver
winking
and
turning
his
head
on
one
side
but
that
where
it
is
i
do
tom
to
be
a
miller
and
farmer
i
see
no
fun
i
that
why
if
i
made
him
a
miller
farmer
he
be
expectin
to
take
to
the
mill
an
the
land
at
me
as
it
was
time
for
me
to
lay
by
an
think
o
my
latter
end
nay
nay
i
seen
enough
o
that
wi
sons
i
never
pull
my
coat
off
before
i
go
to
bed
i
shall
give
tom
an
eddication
an
put
him
to
a
business
as
he
may
make
a
nest
for
himself
an
not
want
to
push
me
out
o
mine
pretty
well
if
he
gets
it
when
i
dead
an
gone
i
be
put
off
wi
afore
i
lost
my
teeth
this
was
evidently
a
point
on
which
tulliver
felt
strongly
and
the
impetus
which
had
given
unusual
rapidity
and
emphasis
to
his
speech
showed
itself
still
unexhausted
for
some
minutes
afterward
in
a
defiant
motion
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
and
an
occasional
nay
nay
like
a
subsiding
growl
these
angry
symptoms
were
keenly
observed
by
maggie
and
cut
her
to
the
quick
tom
it
appeared
was
supposed
capable
of
turning
his
father
out
of
doors
and
of
making
the
future
in
some
way
tragic
by
his
wickedness
this
was
not
to
be
borne
and
maggie
jumped
up
from
her
stool
forgetting
all
about
her
heavy
book
which
fell
with
a
bang
within
the
fender
and
going
up
between
her
father
knees
said
in
a
voice
father
tom
would
be
naughty
to
you
ever
i
know
he
would
tulliver
was
out
of
the
room
superintending
a
choice
and
tulliver
heart
was
touched
so
maggie
was
not
scolded
about
the
book
riley
quietly
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
while
the
father
laughed
with
a
certain
tenderness
in
his
face
and
patted
his
little
girl
on
the
back
and
then
held
her
hands
and
kept
her
between
his
knees
what
they
must
say
any
harm
o
tom
eh
said
tulliver
looking
at
maggie
with
a
twinkling
eye
then
in
a
lower
voice
turning
to
riley
as
though
maggie
could
hear
she
understands
what
one
talking
about
so
as
never
was
and
you
should
hear
her
read
straight
off
as
if
she
knowed
it
all
beforehand
and
allays
at
her
book
but
it
bad
it
bad
tulliver
added
sadly
checking
this
blamable
exultation
a
woman
no
business
wi
being
so
clever
it
turn
to
trouble
i
doubt
but
bless
you
here
the
exultation
was
clearly
recovering
the
mastery
she
read
the
books
and
understand
better
nor
half
the
folks
as
are
growed
up
maggie
cheeks
began
to
flush
with
triumphant
excitement
she
thought
riley
would
have
a
respect
for
her
now
it
had
been
evident
that
he
thought
nothing
of
her
before
riley
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
and
she
could
make
nothing
of
his
face
with
its
eyebrows
but
he
presently
looked
at
her
and
said
come
come
and
tell
me
something
about
this
book
here
are
some
pictures
i
want
to
know
what
they
mean
maggie
with
deepening
color
went
without
hesitation
to
elbow
and
looked
over
the
book
eagerly
seizing
one
corner
and
tossing
back
her
mane
while
she
said
oh
i
tell
you
what
that
means
it
a
dreadful
picture
is
it
but
i
ca
help
looking
at
it
that
old
woman
in
the
water
a
witch
they
put
her
in
to
find
out
whether
she
a
witch
or
no
and
if
she
swims
she
a
witch
and
if
she
drowned
and
killed
you
know
she
innocent
and
not
a
witch
but
only
a
poor
silly
old
woman
but
what
good
would
it
do
her
then
you
know
when
she
was
drowned
only
i
suppose
she
go
to
heaven
and
god
would
make
it
up
to
her
and
this
dreadful
blacksmith
with
his
arms
akimbo
laughing
oh
is
he
ugly
i
tell
you
what
he
is
he
the
devil
here
maggie
voice
became
louder
and
more
emphatic
and
not
a
right
blacksmith
for
the
devil
takes
the
shape
of
wicked
men
and
walks
about
and
sets
people
doing
wicked
things
and
oftener
in
the
shape
of
a
bad
man
than
any
other
because
you
know
if
people
saw
he
was
the
devil
and
he
roared
at
they
run
away
and
he
could
make
do
what
he
pleased
tulliver
had
listened
to
this
exposition
of
maggie
with
petrifying
wonder
why
what
book
is
it
the
wench
has
got
hold
on
he
burst
out
at
last
the
of
the
devil
by
daniel
defoe
not
quite
the
right
book
for
a
little
girl
said
riley
how
came
it
among
your
books
mr
tulliver
maggie
looked
hurt
and
discouraged
while
her
father
said
why
it
one
o
the
books
i
bought
at
partridge
sale
they
was
all
bound
alike
it
a
good
binding
you
see
and
i
thought
they
be
all
good
books
there
jeremy
taylor
living
and
dying
among
i
read
in
it
often
of
a
sunday
tulliver
felt
somehow
a
familiarity
with
that
great
writer
because
his
name
was
jeremy
and
there
a
lot
more
of
sermons
mostly
i
think
but
they
all
got
the
same
covers
and
i
thought
they
were
all
o
one
sample
as
you
may
say
but
it
seems
one
must
judge
by
th
outside
this
is
a
puzzlin
world
well
said
riley
in
an
admonitory
patronizing
tone
as
he
patted
maggie
on
the
head
i
advise
you
to
put
by
the
of
the
devil
and
read
some
prettier
book
have
you
no
prettier
books
oh
yes
said
maggie
reviving
a
little
in
the
desire
to
vindicate
the
variety
of
her
reading
i
know
the
reading
in
this
book
pretty
but
i
like
the
pictures
and
i
make
stories
to
the
pictures
out
of
my
own
head
you
know
but
i
got
fables
and
a
book
about
kangaroos
and
things
and
the
progress
ah
a
beautiful
book
said
riley
you
ca
read
a
better
well
but
there
a
great
deal
about
the
devil
in
that
said
maggie
triumphantly
and
i
show
you
the
picture
of
him
in
his
true
shape
as
he
fought
with
christian
maggie
ran
in
an
instant
to
the
corner
of
the
room
jumped
on
a
chair
and
reached
down
from
the
small
bookcase
a
shabby
old
copy
of
bunyan
which
opened
at
once
without
the
least
trouble
of
search
at
the
picture
she
wanted
here
he
is
she
said
running
back
to
riley
and
tom
colored
him
for
me
with
his
paints
when
he
was
at
home
last
holidays
the
body
all
black
you
know
and
the
eyes
red
like
fire
because
all
fire
inside
and
it
shines
out
at
his
eyes
go
go
said
tulliver
peremptorily
beginning
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
at
these
free
remarks
on
the
personal
appearance
of
a
being
powerful
enough
to
create
lawyers
shut
up
the
book
and
hear
no
more
o
such
talk
it
is
as
i
thought
the
child
learn
more
mischief
nor
good
wi
the
books
go
go
and
see
after
your
mother
maggie
shut
up
the
book
at
once
with
a
sense
of
disgrace
but
not
being
inclined
to
see
after
her
mother
she
compromised
the
matter
by
going
into
a
dark
corner
behind
her
father
chair
and
nursing
her
doll
toward
which
she
had
an
occasional
fit
of
fondness
in
absence
neglecting
its
toilet
but
lavishing
so
many
warm
kisses
on
it
that
the
waxen
cheeks
had
a
wasted
unhealthy
appearance
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
o
said
tulliver
as
maggie
retired
it
a
pity
but
what
she
been
the
lad
she
ha
been
a
match
for
the
lawyers
would
it
the
thing
here
he
lowered
his
voice
as
i
picked
the
mother
because
she
was
bein
a
woman
too
an
come
of
a
rare
family
for
managing
but
i
picked
her
from
her
sisters
o
purpose
she
was
a
bit
weak
like
for
i
was
agoin
to
be
told
the
rights
o
things
by
my
own
fireside
but
you
see
when
a
man
got
brains
himself
there
no
knowing
where
they
run
to
an
a
pleasant
sort
o
soft
woman
may
go
on
breeding
you
stupid
lads
and
wenches
till
like
as
if
the
world
was
turned
it
an
uncommon
thing
riley
gravity
gave
way
and
he
shook
a
little
under
the
application
of
his
pinch
of
snuff
before
he
said
but
your
lad
not
stupid
is
he
i
saw
him
when
i
was
here
last
busy
making
he
seemed
quite
up
to
it
well
he
is
not
to
say
stupid
he
got
a
notion
o
things
out
door
an
a
sort
o
common
sense
as
he
lay
hold
o
things
by
the
right
handle
but
he
slow
with
his
tongue
you
see
and
he
reads
but
poorly
and
ca
abide
the
books
and
spells
all
wrong
they
tell
me
an
as
shy
as
can
be
wi
strangers
an
you
never
hear
him
say
things
like
the
little
wench
now
what
i
want
is
to
send
him
to
a
school
where
they
make
him
a
bit
nimble
with
his
tongue
and
his
pen
and
make
a
smart
chap
of
him
i
want
my
son
to
be
even
wi
these
fellows
as
have
got
the
start
o
me
with
having
better
schooling
not
but
what
if
the
world
had
been
left
as
god
made
it
i
could
ha
seen
my
way
and
held
my
own
wi
the
best
of
but
things
have
got
so
twisted
round
and
wrapped
up
i
unreasonable
words
as
are
a
bit
like
as
i
clean
at
fault
often
an
often
everything
winds
about
so
the
more
straightforrad
you
are
the
more
you
puzzled
tulliver
took
a
draught
swallowed
it
slowly
and
shook
his
head
in
a
melancholy
manner
conscious
of
exemplifying
the
truth
that
a
perfectly
sane
intellect
is
hardly
at
home
in
this
insane
world
you
quite
in
the
right
of
it
tulliver
observed
riley
better
spend
an
extra
hundred
or
two
on
your
son
education
than
leave
it
him
in
your
will
i
know
i
should
have
tried
to
do
so
by
a
son
of
mine
if
i
had
one
though
god
knows
i
have
your
ready
money
to
play
with
tulliver
and
i
have
a
houseful
of
daughters
into
the
bargain
i
dare
say
now
you
know
of
a
school
as
be
just
the
thing
for
tom
said
tulliver
not
diverted
from
his
purpose
by
any
sympathy
with
riley
deficiency
of
ready
cash
riley
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
kept
tulliver
in
suspense
by
a
silence
that
seemed
deliberative
before
he
said
i
know
of
a
very
fine
chance
for
any
one
that
got
the
necessary
money
and
that
what
you
have
tulliver
the
fact
is
i
recommend
any
friend
of
mine
to
send
a
boy
to
a
regular
school
if
he
could
afford
to
do
better
but
if
any
one
wanted
his
boy
to
get
superior
instruction
and
training
where
he
would
be
the
companion
of
his
master
and
that
master
a
first
rate
fellow
i
know
his
man
i
would
mention
the
chance
to
everybody
because
i
do
think
everybody
would
succeed
in
getting
it
if
he
were
to
try
but
i
mention
it
to
you
tulliver
between
ourselves
the
fixed
inquiring
glance
with
which
tulliver
had
been
watching
his
friend
oracular
face
became
quite
eager
ay
now
let
hear
he
said
adjusting
himself
in
his
chair
with
the
complacency
of
a
person
who
is
thought
worthy
of
important
communications
he
an
oxford
man
said
riley
sententiously
shutting
his
mouth
close
and
looking
at
tulliver
to
observe
the
effect
of
this
stimulating
information
what
a
parson
said
tulliver
rather
doubtfully
yes
and
an
the
bishop
i
understand
thinks
very
highly
of
him
why
it
was
the
bishop
who
got
him
his
present
curacy
ah
said
tulliver
to
whom
one
thing
was
as
wonderful
as
another
concerning
these
unfamiliar
phenomena
but
what
can
he
want
wi
tom
then
why
the
fact
is
he
fond
of
teaching
and
wishes
to
keep
up
his
studies
and
a
clergyman
has
but
little
opportunity
for
that
in
his
parochial
duties
he
willing
to
take
one
or
two
boys
as
pupils
to
fill
up
his
time
profitably
the
boys
would
be
quite
of
the
family
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
for
them
under
stelling
eye
continually
but
do
you
think
they
give
the
poor
lad
twice
o
pudding
said
tulliver
who
was
now
in
her
place
again
he
such
a
boy
for
pudding
as
never
was
an
a
growing
boy
like
that
it
dreadful
to
think
o
their
stintin
him
and
what
money
he
want
said
tulliver
whose
instinct
told
him
that
the
services
of
this
admirable
would
bear
a
high
price
why
i
know
of
a
clergyman
who
asks
a
hundred
and
fifty
with
his
youngest
pupils
and
he
not
to
be
mentioned
with
stelling
the
man
i
speak
of
i
know
on
good
authority
that
one
of
the
chief
people
at
oxford
said
stelling
might
get
the
highest
honors
if
he
chose
but
he
did
care
about
university
honors
he
a
quiet
man
not
noisy
ah
a
deal
better
a
deal
better
said
tulliver
but
a
hundred
and
fifty
an
uncommon
price
i
never
thought
o
paying
so
much
as
that
a
good
education
let
me
tell
you
tulliver
a
good
education
is
cheap
at
the
money
but
stelling
is
moderate
in
his
terms
he
not
a
grasping
man
i
no
doubt
he
take
your
boy
at
a
hundred
and
that
what
you
would
get
many
other
clergymen
to
do
i
write
to
him
about
it
if
you
like
tulliver
rubbed
his
knees
and
looked
at
the
carpet
in
a
meditative
manner
but
belike
he
a
bachelor
observed
tulliver
in
the
interval
an
i
no
opinion
o
housekeepers
there
was
my
brother
as
is
dead
an
gone
had
a
housekeeper
once
an
she
took
half
the
feathers
out
o
the
best
bed
an
packed
up
an
sent
away
an
it
unknown
the
linen
she
made
away
with
stott
her
name
was
it
break
my
heart
to
send
tom
where
there
a
housekeeper
an
i
hope
you
think
of
it
mr
tulliver
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
tulliver
said
riley
for
stelling
is
married
to
as
nice
a
little
woman
as
any
man
need
wish
for
a
wife
there
is
a
kinder
little
soul
in
the
world
i
know
her
family
well
she
has
very
much
your
complexion
light
curly
hair
she
comes
of
a
good
mudport
family
and
it
not
every
offer
that
would
have
been
acceptable
in
that
quarter
but
stelling
not
an
man
rather
a
particular
fellow
as
to
the
people
he
chooses
to
be
connected
with
but
i
he
would
have
no
objection
to
take
your
son
i
he
would
not
on
my
representation
i
do
know
what
he
could
have
the
lad
said
tulliver
with
a
slight
touch
of
motherly
indignation
a
nice
lad
as
anybody
need
wish
to
see
but
there
one
thing
i
thinking
on
said
tulliver
turning
his
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
riley
after
a
long
perusal
of
the
carpet
would
a
parson
be
almost
too
to
bring
up
a
lad
to
be
a
man
o
business
my
notion
o
the
parsons
was
as
got
a
sort
o
learning
as
lay
mostly
out
o
sight
and
that
is
what
i
want
for
tom
i
want
him
to
know
figures
and
write
like
print
and
see
into
things
quick
and
know
what
folks
mean
and
how
to
wrap
things
up
in
words
as
are
actionable
it
an
uncommon
fine
thing
that
is
concluded
tulliver
shaking
his
head
when
you
can
let
a
man
know
what
you
think
of
him
without
paying
for
it
oh
my
dear
tulliver
said
riley
you
quite
under
a
mistake
about
the
clergy
all
the
best
schoolmasters
are
of
the
clergy
the
schoolmasters
who
are
not
clergymen
are
a
very
low
set
of
men
generally
ay
that
jacobs
is
at
the
interposed
tulliver
to
be
sure
men
who
have
failed
in
other
trades
most
likely
now
a
clergyman
is
a
gentleman
by
profession
and
education
and
besides
that
he
has
the
knowledge
that
will
ground
a
boy
and
prepare
him
for
entering
on
any
career
with
credit
there
may
be
some
clergymen
who
are
mere
bookmen
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
stelling
is
not
one
of
them
a
man
that
wide
awake
let
me
tell
you
drop
him
a
hint
and
that
enough
you
talk
of
figures
now
you
have
only
to
say
to
stelling
want
my
son
to
be
a
thorough
arithmetician
and
you
may
leave
the
rest
to
him
riley
paused
a
moment
while
tulliver
reassured
as
to
clerical
tutorship
was
inwardly
rehearsing
to
an
imaginary
stelling
the
statement
i
want
my
son
to
know
you
see
my
dear
tulliver
riley
continued
when
you
get
a
thoroughly
educated
man
like
stelling
he
at
no
loss
to
take
up
any
branch
of
instruction
when
a
workman
knows
the
use
of
his
tools
he
can
make
a
door
as
well
as
a
window
ay
that
true
said
tulliver
almost
convinced
now
that
the
clergy
must
be
the
best
of
schoolmasters
well
i
tell
you
what
i
do
for
you
said
riley
and
i
would
do
it
for
everybody
i
see
stelling
or
drop
him
a
line
when
i
get
back
to
mudport
to
say
that
you
wish
to
place
your
boy
with
his
and
i
dare
say
stelling
will
write
to
you
and
send
you
his
terms
but
there
no
hurry
is
there
said
tulliver
for
i
hope
tulliver
you
wo
let
tom
begin
at
his
new
school
before
midsummer
he
began
at
the
at
the
quarter
and
you
see
what
good
come
of
it
ay
ay
bessy
never
brew
wi
bad
malt
upo
else
you
have
a
poor
tap
said
tulliver
winking
and
smiling
at
riley
with
the
natural
pride
of
a
man
who
has
a
buxom
wife
conspicuously
his
inferior
in
intellect
but
it
true
there
no
hurry
you
hit
it
there
bessy
it
might
be
as
well
not
to
defer
the
arrangement
too
long
said
riley
quietly
for
stelling
may
have
propositions
from
other
parties
and
i
know
he
would
not
take
more
than
two
or
three
boarders
if
so
many
if
i
were
you
i
think
i
would
enter
on
the
subject
with
stelling
at
once
there
no
necessity
for
sending
the
boy
before
midsummer
but
i
would
be
on
the
safe
side
and
make
sure
that
nobody
forestalls
you
ay
there
summat
in
that
said
tulliver
father
broke
in
maggie
who
had
stolen
unperceived
to
her
elbow
again
listening
with
parted
lips
while
she
held
her
doll
and
crushed
its
nose
against
the
wood
of
the
chair
father
is
it
a
long
way
off
where
tom
is
to
go
we
ever
go
to
see
him
i
do
know
my
wench
said
the
father
tenderly
ask
riley
he
knows
maggie
came
round
promptly
in
front
of
riley
and
said
how
far
is
it
please
sir
oh
a
long
long
way
off
that
gentleman
answered
being
of
opinion
that
children
when
they
are
not
naughty
should
always
be
spoken
to
jocosely
you
must
borrow
the
boots
to
get
to
him
that
nonsense
said
maggie
tossing
her
head
haughtily
and
turning
away
with
the
tears
springing
in
her
eyes
she
began
to
dislike
riley
it
was
evident
he
thought
her
silly
and
of
no
consequence
hush
maggie
for
shame
of
you
asking
questions
and
chattering
said
her
mother
come
and
sit
down
on
your
little
stool
and
hold
your
tongue
do
but
added
tulliver
who
had
her
own
alarm
awakened
is
it
so
far
off
as
i
could
wash
him
and
mend
him
about
fifteen
miles
that
all
said
riley
you
can
drive
there
and
back
in
a
day
quite
comfortably
or
stelling
is
a
hospitable
pleasant
man
he
be
glad
to
have
you
stay
but
it
too
far
off
for
the
linen
i
doubt
said
tulliver
sadly
the
entrance
of
supper
opportunely
adjourned
this
difficulty
and
relieved
riley
from
the
labor
of
suggesting
some
solution
or
compromise
a
labor
which
he
would
otherwise
doubtless
have
undertaken
for
as
you
perceive
he
was
a
man
of
very
obliging
manners
and
he
had
really
given
himself
the
trouble
of
recommending
stelling
to
his
friend
tulliver
without
any
positive
expectation
of
a
solid
definite
advantage
resulting
to
himself
notwithstanding
the
subtle
indications
to
the
contrary
which
might
have
misled
a
observer
for
there
is
nothing
more
widely
misleading
than
sagacity
if
it
happens
to
get
on
a
wrong
scent
and
sagacity
persuaded
that
men
usually
act
and
speak
from
distinct
motives
with
a
consciously
proposed
end
in
view
is
certain
to
waste
its
energies
on
imaginary
game
plotting
covetousness
and
deliberate
contrivance
in
order
to
compass
a
selfish
end
are
nowhere
abundant
but
in
the
world
of
the
dramatist
they
demand
too
intense
a
mental
action
for
many
of
our
to
be
guilty
of
them
it
is
easy
enough
to
spoil
the
lives
of
our
neighbors
without
taking
so
much
trouble
we
can
do
it
by
lazy
acquiescence
and
lazy
omission
by
trivial
falsities
for
which
we
hardly
know
a
reason
by
small
frauds
neutralized
by
small
extravagances
by
maladroit
flatteries
and
clumsily
improvised
insinuations
we
live
from
hand
to
mouth
most
of
us
with
a
small
family
of
immediate
desires
we
do
little
else
than
snatch
a
morsel
to
satisfy
the
hungry
brood
rarely
thinking
of
or
the
next
year
crop
riley
was
a
man
of
business
and
not
cold
toward
his
own
interest
yet
even
he
was
more
under
the
influence
of
small
promptings
than
of
designs
he
had
no
private
understanding
with
the
rev
walter
stelling
on
the
contrary
he
knew
very
little
of
that
and
his
acquirements
not
quite
enough
perhaps
to
warrant
so
strong
a
recommendation
of
him
as
he
had
given
to
his
friend
tulliver
but
he
believed
stelling
to
be
an
excellent
classic
for
gadsby
had
said
so
and
gadsby
first
cousin
was
an
oxford
tutor
which
was
better
ground
for
the
belief
even
than
his
own
immediate
observation
would
have
been
for
though
riley
had
received
a
tincture
of
the
classics
at
the
great
mudport
free
school
and
had
a
sense
of
understanding
latin
generally
his
comprehension
of
any
particular
latin
was
not
ready
doubtless
there
remained
a
subtle
aroma
from
his
juvenile
contact
with
the
de
senectute
and
the
fourth
book
of
the
æneid
but
it
had
ceased
to
be
distinctly
recognizable
as
classical
and
was
only
perceived
in
the
higher
finish
and
force
of
his
auctioneering
style
then
stelling
was
an
oxford
man
and
the
oxford
men
were
always
no
no
it
was
the
cambridge
men
who
were
always
good
mathematicians
but
a
man
who
had
had
a
university
education
could
teach
anything
he
liked
especially
a
man
like
stelling
who
had
made
a
speech
at
a
mudport
dinner
on
a
political
occasion
and
had
acquitted
himself
so
well
that
it
was
generally
remarked
this
of
timpson
was
a
sharp
fellow
it
was
to
be
expected
of
a
mudport
man
from
the
parish
of
ursula
that
he
would
not
omit
to
do
a
good
turn
to
a
of
timpson
for
timpson
was
one
of
the
most
useful
and
influential
men
in
the
parish
and
had
a
good
deal
of
business
which
he
knew
how
to
put
into
the
right
hands
riley
liked
such
men
quite
apart
from
any
money
which
might
be
diverted
through
their
good
judgment
from
less
worthy
pockets
into
his
own
and
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
him
to
say
to
timpson
on
his
return
home
i
secured
a
good
pupil
for
your
timpson
had
a
large
family
of
daughters
riley
felt
for
him
besides
louisa
timpson
face
with
its
light
curls
had
been
a
familiar
object
to
him
over
the
pew
wainscot
on
a
sunday
for
nearly
fifteen
years
it
was
natural
her
husband
should
be
a
commendable
tutor
moreover
riley
knew
of
no
other
schoolmaster
whom
he
had
any
ground
for
recommending
in
preference
why
then
should
he
not
recommend
stelling
his
friend
tulliver
had
asked
him
for
an
opinion
it
is
always
chilling
in
friendly
intercourse
to
say
you
have
no
opinion
to
give
and
if
you
deliver
an
opinion
at
all
it
is
mere
stupidity
not
to
do
it
with
an
air
of
conviction
and
knowledge
you
make
it
your
own
in
uttering
it
and
naturally
get
fond
of
it
thus
riley
knowing
no
harm
of
stelling
to
begin
with
and
wishing
him
well
so
far
as
he
had
any
wishes
at
all
concerning
him
had
no
sooner
recommended
him
than
he
began
to
think
with
admiration
of
a
man
recommended
on
such
high
authority
and
would
soon
have
gathered
so
warm
an
interest
on
the
subject
that
if
tulliver
had
in
the
end
declined
to
send
tom
to
stelling
riley
would
have
thought
his
friend
of
the
old
school
a
thoroughly
fellow
if
you
blame
riley
very
severely
for
giving
a
recommendation
on
such
slight
grounds
i
must
say
you
are
rather
hard
upon
him
why
should
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
thirty
years
ago
who
had
as
good
as
forgotten
his
latin
be
expected
to
manifest
a
delicate
scrupulosity
which
is
not
always
exhibited
by
gentlemen
of
the
learned
professions
even
in
our
present
advanced
stage
of
morality
besides
a
man
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
him
can
scarcely
abstain
from
doing
a
action
and
one
can
not
be
all
round
nature
herself
occasionally
quarters
an
inconvenient
parasite
on
an
animal
toward
whom
she
has
otherwise
no
ill
will
what
then
we
admire
her
care
for
the
parasite
if
riley
had
shrunk
from
giving
a
recommendation
that
was
not
based
on
valid
evidence
he
would
not
have
helped
stelling
to
a
paying
pupil
and
that
would
not
have
been
so
well
for
the
reverend
gentleman
consider
too
that
all
the
pleasant
little
dim
ideas
and
complacencies
of
standing
well
with
timpson
of
dispensing
advice
when
he
was
asked
for
it
of
impressing
his
friend
tulliver
with
additional
respect
of
saying
something
and
saying
it
emphatically
with
other
inappreciably
minute
ingredients
that
went
along
with
the
warm
hearth
and
the
to
make
up
riley
consciousness
on
this
occasion
would
have
been
a
mere
blank
chapter
iv
tom
is
expected
it
was
a
heavy
disappointment
to
maggie
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
with
her
father
in
the
gig
when
he
went
to
fetch
tom
home
from
the
academy
but
the
morning
was
too
wet
tulliver
said
for
a
little
girl
to
go
out
in
her
best
bonnet
maggie
took
the
opposite
view
very
strongly
and
it
was
a
direct
consequence
of
this
difference
of
opinion
that
when
her
mother
was
in
the
act
of
brushing
out
the
reluctant
black
crop
maggie
suddenly
rushed
from
under
her
hands
and
dipped
her
head
in
a
basin
of
water
standing
near
in
the
vindictive
determination
that
there
should
be
no
more
chance
of
curls
that
day
maggie
maggie
exclaimed
tulliver
sitting
stout
and
helpless
with
the
brushes
on
her
lap
what
is
to
become
of
you
if
you
so
naughty
i
tell
your
aunt
glegg
and
your
aunt
pullet
when
they
come
next
week
and
they
never
love
you
any
more
oh
dear
oh
dear
look
at
your
clean
pinafore
wet
from
top
to
bottom
folks
think
a
judgment
on
me
as
i
got
such
a
child
they
think
i
done
summat
wicked
before
this
remonstrance
was
finished
maggie
was
already
out
of
hearing
making
her
way
toward
the
great
attic
that
run
under
the
old
roof
shaking
the
water
from
her
black
locks
as
she
ran
like
a
skye
terrier
escaped
from
his
bath
this
attic
was
favorite
retreat
on
a
wet
day
when
the
weather
was
not
too
cold
here
she
fretted
out
all
her
ill
humors
and
talked
aloud
to
the
floors
and
the
shelves
and
the
dark
rafters
festooned
with
cobwebs
and
here
she
kept
a
fetish
which
she
punished
for
all
her
misfortunes
this
was
the
trunk
of
a
large
wooden
doll
which
once
stared
with
the
roundest
of
eyes
above
the
reddest
of
cheeks
but
was
now
entirely
defaced
by
a
long
career
of
vicarious
suffering
three
nails
driven
into
the
head
commemorated
as
many
crises
in
nine
years
of
earthly
struggle
that
luxury
of
vengeance
having
been
suggested
to
her
by
the
picture
of
jael
destroying
sisera
in
the
old
bible
the
last
nail
had
been
driven
in
with
a
fiercer
stroke
than
usual
for
the
fetish
on
that
occasion
represented
aunt
glegg
but
immediately
afterward
maggie
had
reflected
that
if
she
drove
many
nails
in
she
would
not
be
so
well
able
to
fancy
that
the
head
was
hurt
when
she
knocked
it
against
the
wall
nor
to
comfort
it
and
make
believe
to
poultice
it
when
her
fury
was
abated
for
even
aunt
glegg
would
be
pitiable
when
she
had
been
hurt
very
much
and
thoroughly
humiliated
so
as
to
beg
her
niece
pardon
since
then
she
had
driven
no
more
nails
in
but
had
soothed
herself
by
alternately
grinding
and
beating
the
wooden
head
against
the
rough
brick
of
the
great
chimneys
that
made
two
square
pillars
supporting
the
roof
that
was
what
she
did
this
morning
on
reaching
the
attic
sobbing
all
the
while
with
a
passion
that
expelled
every
other
form
of
consciousness
even
the
memory
of
the
grievance
that
had
caused
it
as
at
last
the
sobs
were
getting
quieter
and
the
grinding
less
fierce
a
sudden
beam
of
sunshine
falling
through
the
wire
lattice
across
the
shelves
made
her
throw
away
the
fetish
and
run
to
the
window
the
sun
was
really
breaking
out
the
sound
of
the
mill
seemed
cheerful
again
the
granary
doors
were
open
and
there
was
yap
the
queer
terrier
with
one
ear
turned
back
trotting
about
and
sniffing
vaguely
as
if
he
were
in
search
of
a
companion
it
was
irresistible
maggie
tossed
her
hair
back
and
ran
downstairs
seized
her
bonnet
without
putting
it
on
peeped
and
then
dashed
along
the
passage
lest
she
should
encounter
her
mother
and
was
quickly
out
in
the
yard
whirling
round
like
a
pythoness
and
singing
as
she
whirled
yap
yap
tom
coming
home
while
yap
danced
and
barked
round
her
as
much
as
to
say
if
there
was
any
noise
wanted
he
was
the
dog
for
it
hegh
hegh
miss
you
make
yourself
giddy
an
tumble
down
i
the
dirt
said
luke
the
head
miller
a
tall
man
of
forty
and
subdued
by
a
general
mealiness
like
an
auricula
maggie
paused
in
her
whirling
and
said
staggering
a
little
oh
no
it
does
make
me
giddy
luke
may
i
go
into
the
mill
with
you
maggie
loved
to
linger
in
the
great
spaces
of
the
mill
and
often
came
out
with
her
black
hair
powdered
to
a
soft
whiteness
that
made
her
dark
eyes
flash
out
with
new
fire
the
resolute
din
the
unresting
motion
of
the
great
stones
giving
her
a
dim
delicious
awe
as
at
the
presence
of
an
uncontrollable
force
the
meal
forever
pouring
pouring
the
fine
white
powder
softening
all
surfaces
and
making
the
very
spidernets
look
like
a
faery
the
sweet
pure
scent
of
the
meal
all
helped
to
make
maggie
feel
that
the
mill
was
a
little
world
apart
from
her
outside
life
the
spiders
were
especially
a
subject
of
speculation
with
her
she
wondered
if
they
had
any
relatives
outside
the
mill
for
in
that
case
there
must
be
a
painful
difficulty
in
their
family
intercourse
a
fat
and
floury
spider
accustomed
to
take
his
fly
well
dusted
with
meal
must
suffer
a
little
at
a
cousin
table
where
the
fly
was
and
the
lady
spiders
must
be
mutually
shocked
at
each
other
appearance
but
the
part
of
the
mill
she
liked
best
was
the
topmost
story
the
where
there
were
the
great
heaps
of
grain
which
she
could
sit
on
and
slide
down
continually
she
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
this
recreation
as
she
conversed
with
luke
to
whom
she
was
very
communicative
wishing
him
to
think
well
of
her
understanding
as
her
father
did
perhaps
she
felt
it
necessary
to
recover
her
position
with
him
on
the
present
occasion
for
as
she
sat
sliding
on
the
heap
of
grain
near
which
he
was
busying
himself
she
said
at
that
shrill
pitch
which
was
requisite
in
i
think
you
never
read
any
book
but
the
bible
did
you
luke
nay
miss

not

but
there

of
europe
that
would
tell
you
all
about
the
different
sorts
of
people
in
the
world
and
if
you
did
understand
the
reading
the
pictures
would
help
you
they
show
the
looks
and
ways
of
the
people
and
what
they
do
there
are
the
dutchmen
very
fat
and
smoking
you
know
and
one
sitting
on
a
barrel
nay

no
opinion
o

said
maggie
rather
foiled
by
luke
unexpectedly
decided
views
about
dutchmen
perhaps
you
would
like
better
that
not
dutchmen
you
know
but
elephants
and
kangaroos
and
the
and
the
sunfish
and
a
bird
sitting
on
its
tail
i
forget
its
name
there
are
countries
full
of
those
creatures
instead
of
horses
and
cows
you
know
should
you
like
to
know
about
them
luke
nay
miss
got
to
keep

the
men

i
the
streets
why

my
brother

said
maggie
wishing
to
turn
the
conversation
agreeably
tom
not
fond
of
reading
i
love
tom
so
dearly
luke
better
than
anybody
else

sliding
seat
on
the
corn
oh

and
the
spotted
doe
that
tom
spent
all
his
money

dead

said
luke
fetching
his
comparison
from
the
unmistakable
corpses
nailed
to
the
stable
wall
oh
dear
luke
said
maggie
in
a
piteous
tone
while
the
big
tears
rolled
down
her
cheek
tom
told
me
to
take
care
of
and
i
forgot
what
i
do
well

they

miss
will
you
come
along
home
wi
me
and
see
my
wife
i
this
minute
the
invitation
offered
an
agreeable
distraction
to
maggie
grief
and
her
tears
gradually
subsided
as
she
trotted
along
by
luke
side
to
his
pleasant
cottage
which
stood
with
its
apple
and
pear
trees
and
with
the
added
dignity
of
a
pigsty
at
the
other
end
of
the
mill
fields
moggs
luke
wife
was
a
decidedly
agreeable
acquaintance
she
exhibited
her
hospitality
in
bread
and
treacle
and
possessed
various
works
of
art
maggie
actually
forgot
that
she
had
any
special
cause
of
sadness
this
morning
as
she
stood
on
a
chair
to
look
at
a
remarkable
series
of
pictures
representing
the
prodigal
son
in
the
costume
of
sir
charles
grandison
except
that
as
might
have
been
expected
from
his
defective
moral
character
he
had
not
like
that
accomplished
hero
the
taste
and
strength
of
mind
to
dispense
with
a
wig
but
the
indefinable
weight
the
dead
rabbits
had
left
on
her
mind
caused
her
to
feel
more
than
usual
pity
for
the
career
of
this
weak
young
man
particularly
when
she
looked
at
the
picture
where
he
leaned
against
a
tree
with
a
flaccid
appearance
his
unbuttoned
and
his
wig
awry
while
the
swine
apparently
of
some
foreign
breed
seemed
to
insult
him
by
their
good
spirits
over
their
feast
of
husks
i
very
glad
his
father
took
him
back
again
are
you
luke
she
said
for
he
was
very
sorry
you
know
and
would
do
wrong
again
eh
miss
said
luke
he
be
no
great
shakes
i
doubt
feyther
do
what
he
would
for
him
that
was
a
painful
thought
to
maggie
and
she
wished
much
that
the
subsequent
history
of
the
young
man
had
not
been
left
a
blank
chapter
v
tom
comes
home
tom
was
to
arrive
early
in
the
afternoon
and
there
was
another
fluttering
heart
besides
maggie
when
it
was
late
enough
for
the
sound
of
the
to
be
expected
for
if
tulliver
had
a
strong
feeling
it
was
fondness
for
her
boy
at
last
the
sound
came
that
quick
light
bowling
of
the
and
in
spite
of
the
wind
which
was
blowing
the
clouds
about
and
was
not
likely
to
respect
tulliver
curls
and
she
came
outside
the
door
and
even
held
her
hand
on
maggie
offending
head
forgetting
all
the
griefs
of
the
morning
there
he
is
my
sweet
lad
but
lord
ha
mercy
he
got
never
a
collar
on
it
been
lost
on
the
road
i
be
bound
and
spoilt
the
set
tulliver
stood
with
her
arms
open
maggie
jumped
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
while
tom
descended
from
the
gig
and
said
with
masculine
reticence
as
to
the
tender
emotions
hallo
yap
what
are
you
there
nevertheless
he
submitted
to
be
kissed
willingly
enough
though
maggie
hung
on
his
neck
in
rather
a
strangling
fashion
while
his
eyes
wandered
toward
the
croft
and
the
lambs
and
the
river
where
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
begin
to
fish
the
first
thing
morning
he
was
one
of
those
lads
that
grow
everywhere
in
england
and
at
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
look
as
much
alike
as
goslings
a
lad
with
hair
cheeks
of
cream
and
roses
full
lips
indeterminate
nose
and
eyebrows
a
physiognomy
in
which
it
seems
impossible
to
discern
anything
but
the
generic
character
to
boyhood
as
different
as
possible
from
poor
maggie
phiz
which
nature
seemed
to
have
moulded
and
colored
with
the
most
decided
intention
but
that
same
nature
has
the
deep
cunning
which
hides
itself
under
the
appearance
of
openness
so
that
simple
people
think
they
can
see
through
her
quite
well
and
all
the
while
she
is
secretly
preparing
a
refutation
of
their
confident
prophecies
under
these
average
boyish
physiognomies
that
she
seems
to
turn
off
by
the
gross
she
conceals
some
of
her
most
rigid
inflexible
purposes
some
of
her
most
unmodifiable
characters
and
the
demonstrative
rebellious
girl
may
after
all
turn
out
to
be
a
passive
being
compared
with
this
bit
of
masculinity
with
the
indeterminate
features
maggie
said
tom
confidentially
taking
her
into
a
corner
as
soon
as
his
mother
was
gone
out
to
examine
his
box
and
the
warm
parlor
had
taken
off
the
chill
he
had
felt
from
the
long
drive
you
do
know
what
i
got
in
pockets
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
as
a
means
of
rousing
her
sense
of
mystery
no
said
maggie
how
stodgy
they
look
tom
is
it
marls
marbles
or
cobnuts
maggie
heart
sank
a
little
because
tom
always
said
it
was
no
good
playing
with
at
those
games
she
played
so
badly
marls
no
i
swopped
all
my
marls
with
the
little
fellows
and
cobnuts
are
no
fun
you
silly
only
when
the
nuts
are
green
but
see
here
he
drew
something
half
out
of
his
pocket
what
is
it
said
maggie
in
a
whisper
i
can
see
nothing
but
a
bit
of
yellow
why
it
a
new
guess
maggie
oh
i
guess
tom
said
maggie
impatiently
do
be
a
spitfire
else
i
wo
tell
you
said
tom
thrusting
his
hand
back
into
his
pocket
and
looking
determined
no
tom
said
maggie
imploringly
laying
hold
of
the
arm
that
was
held
stiffly
in
the
pocket
i
not
cross
tom
it
was
only
because
i
ca
bear
guessing
be
good
to
me
tom
arm
slowly
relaxed
and
he
said
well
then
it
a
new
two
new
uns
one
for
you
maggie
all
to
yourself
i
would
go
halves
in
the
toffee
and
gingerbread
on
purpose
to
save
the
money
and
gibson
and
spouncer
fought
with
me
because
i
would
and
here
hooks
see
here
i
say
we
go
and
fish
down
by
the
round
pool
and
you
shall
catch
your
own
fish
maggie
and
put
the
worms
on
and
everything
wo
it
be
fun
maggie
answer
was
to
throw
her
arms
round
tom
neck
and
hug
him
and
hold
her
cheek
against
his
without
speaking
while
he
slowly
unwound
some
of
the
line
saying
after
a
pause
was
i
a
good
brother
now
to
buy
you
a
line
all
to
yourself
you
know
i
need
have
bought
it
if
i
had
liked
yes
very
very
good
i
love
you
tom
tom
had
put
the
line
back
in
his
pocket
and
was
looking
at
the
hooks
one
by
one
before
he
spoke
again
and
the
fellows
fought
me
because
i
would
give
in
about
the
toffee
oh
dear
i
wish
they
would
fight
at
your
school
tom
did
it
hurt
you
hurt
me
no
said
tom
putting
up
the
hooks
again
taking
out
a
large
and
slowly
opening
the
largest
blade
which
he
looked
at
meditatively
as
he
rubbed
his
finger
along
it
then
he
added
i
gave
spouncer
a
black
eye
i
know
that
what
he
got
by
wanting
to
leather
i
was
going
to
go
halves
because
anybody
leathered
me
oh
how
brave
you
are
tom
i
think
you
like
samson
if
there
came
a
lion
roaring
at
me
i
think
you
fight
him
would
you
tom
how
can
a
lion
come
roaring
at
you
you
silly
thing
there
no
lions
only
in
the
shows
no
but
if
we
were
in
the
lion
countries
i
mean
in
africa
where
it
very
hot
the
lions
eat
people
there
i
can
show
it
you
in
the
book
where
i
read
it
well
i
should
get
a
gun
and
shoot
him
but
if
you
had
got
a
gun
we
might
have
gone
out
you
know
not
thinking
just
as
we
go
fishing
and
then
a
great
lion
might
run
toward
us
roaring
and
we
could
get
away
from
him
what
should
you
do
tom
tom
paused
and
at
last
turned
away
contemptuously
saying
but
the
lion
coming
what
the
use
of
talking
but
i
like
to
fancy
how
it
would
be
said
maggie
following
him
just
think
what
you
would
do
tom
oh
do
bother
maggie
you
such
a
silly
i
shall
go
and
see
my
rabbits
maggie
heart
began
to
flutter
with
fear
she
dared
not
tell
the
sad
truth
at
once
but
she
walked
after
tom
in
trembling
silence
as
he
went
out
thinking
how
she
could
tell
him
the
news
so
as
to
soften
at
once
his
sorrow
and
his
anger
for
maggie
dreaded
tom
anger
of
all
things
it
was
quite
a
different
anger
from
her
own
tom
she
said
timidly
when
they
were
out
of
doors
how
much
money
did
you
give
for
your
rabbits
two
and
a
sixpence
said
tom
promptly
i
think
i
got
a
great
deal
more
than
that
in
my
steel
purse
upstairs
i
ask
mother
to
give
it
you
what
for
said
tom
i
do
want
money
you
silly
thing
i
got
a
great
deal
more
money
than
you
because
i
a
boy
i
always
have
and
sovereigns
for
my
christmas
boxes
because
i
shall
be
a
man
and
you
only
have
pieces
because
only
a
girl
well
but
tom
if
mother
would
let
me
give
you
two
and
a
sixpence
out
of
my
purse
to
put
into
your
pocket
and
spend
you
know
and
buy
some
more
rabbits
with
it
more
rabbits
i
do
want
any
more
oh
but
tom
they
all
dead
tom
stopped
immediately
in
his
walk
and
turned
round
toward
maggie
you
forgot
to
feed
then
and
harry
forgot
he
said
his
color
heightening
for
a
moment
but
soon
subsiding
i
pitch
into
harry
i
have
him
turned
away
and
i
do
love
you
maggie
you
go
fishing
with
me
i
told
you
to
go
and
see
the
rabbits
every
day
he
walked
on
again
yes
but
i
forgot
and
i
could
help
it
indeed
tom
i
so
very
sorry
said
maggie
while
the
tears
rushed
fast
you
a
naughty
girl
said
tom
severely
and
i
sorry
i
bought
you
the
i
do
love
you
oh
tom
it
very
cruel
sobbed
maggie
i
forgive
you
if
forgot
anything
i
would
mind
what
you
did
i
forgive
you
and
love
you
yes
you
silly
but
i
never
forget
things
do
oh
please
forgive
me
tom
my
heart
will
break
said
maggie
shaking
with
sobs
clinging
to
tom
arm
and
laying
her
wet
cheek
on
his
shoulder
tom
shook
her
off
and
stopped
again
saying
in
a
peremptory
tone
now
maggie
you
just
listen
are
i
a
good
brother
to
you
sobbed
maggie
her
chin
rising
and
falling
convulsedly
did
i
think
about
your
all
this
quarter
and
mean
to
buy
it
and
saved
my
money
o
purpose
and
would
go
halves
in
the
toffee
and
spouncer
fought
me
because
i
would
and
i
you
so
tom
but
you
a
naughty
girl
last
holidays
you
licked
the
paint
off
my
and
the
holidays
before
that
you
let
the
boat
drag
my
down
when
i
set
you
to
watch
it
and
you
pushed
your
head
through
my
kite
all
for
nothing
but
i
did
mean
said
maggie
i
could
help
it
yes
you
could
said
tom
if
you
minded
what
you
were
doing
and
you
a
naughty
girl
and
you
go
fishing
with
me
with
this
terrible
conclusion
tom
ran
away
from
maggie
toward
the
mill
meaning
to
greet
luke
there
and
complain
to
him
of
harry
maggie
stood
motionless
except
from
her
sobs
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
turned
round
and
ran
into
the
house
and
up
to
her
attic
where
she
sat
on
the
floor
and
laid
her
head
against
the
shelf
with
a
crushing
sense
of
misery
tom
was
come
home
and
she
had
thought
how
happy
she
should
be
and
now
he
was
cruel
to
her
what
use
was
anything
if
tom
did
love
her
oh
he
was
very
cruel
had
she
wanted
to
give
him
the
money
and
said
how
very
sorry
she
was
she
knew
she
was
naughty
to
her
mother
but
she
had
never
been
naughty
to
tom
had
never
to
be
naughty
to
him
oh
he
is
cruel
maggie
sobbed
aloud
finding
a
wretched
pleasure
in
the
hollow
resonance
that
came
through
the
long
empty
space
of
the
attic
she
never
thought
of
beating
or
grinding
her
fetish
she
was
too
miserable
to
be
angry
these
bitter
sorrows
of
childhood
when
sorrow
is
all
new
and
strange
when
hope
has
not
yet
got
wings
to
fly
beyond
the
days
and
weeks
and
the
space
from
summer
to
summer
seems
measureless
maggie
soon
thought
she
had
been
hours
in
the
attic
and
it
must
be
and
they
were
all
having
their
tea
and
not
thinking
of
her
well
then
she
would
stay
up
there
and
starve
herself
hide
herself
behind
the
tub
and
stay
there
all
night
and
then
they
would
all
be
frightened
and
tom
would
be
sorry
thus
maggie
thought
in
the
pride
of
her
heart
as
she
crept
behind
the
tub
but
presently
she
began
to
cry
again
at
the
idea
that
they
did
mind
her
being
there
if
she
went
down
again
to
tom
now
would
he
forgive
her
perhaps
her
father
would
be
there
and
he
would
take
her
part
but
then
she
wanted
tom
to
forgive
her
because
he
loved
her
not
because
his
father
told
him
no
she
would
never
go
down
if
tom
did
come
to
fetch
her
this
resolution
lasted
in
great
intensity
for
five
dark
minutes
behind
the
tub
but
then
the
need
of
being
loved
the
strongest
need
in
poor
maggie
nature
began
to
wrestle
with
her
pride
and
soon
threw
it
she
crept
from
behind
her
tub
into
the
twilight
of
the
long
attic
but
just
then
she
heard
a
quick
on
the
stairs
tom
had
been
too
much
interested
in
his
talk
with
luke
in
going
the
round
of
the
premises
walking
in
and
out
where
he
pleased
and
whittling
sticks
without
any
particular
reason
except
that
he
whittle
sticks
at
school
to
think
of
maggie
and
the
effect
his
anger
had
produced
on
her
he
meant
to
punish
her
and
that
business
having
been
performed
he
occupied
himself
with
other
matters
like
a
practical
person
but
when
he
had
been
called
in
to
tea
his
father
said
why
where
the
little
wench
and
tulliver
almost
at
the
same
moment
said
where
your
little
sister
both
of
them
having
supposed
that
maggie
and
tom
had
been
together
all
the
afternoon
i
do
know
said
tom
he
did
want
to
tell
of
maggie
though
he
was
angry
with
her
for
tom
tulliver
was
a
lad
of
honor
what
has
she
been
playing
with
you
all
this
while
said
the
father
she
been
thinking
o
nothing
but
your
coming
home
i
have
seen
her
this
two
hours
says
tom
commencing
on
the
plumcake
goodness
heart
she
got
drownded
exclaimed
tulliver
rising
from
her
seat
and
running
to
the
window
how
could
you
let
her
do
so
she
added
as
became
a
fearful
woman
accusing
she
did
know
whom
of
she
did
know
what
nay
nay
she
none
drownded
said
tulliver
you
been
naughty
to
her
i
doubt
tom
i
sure
i
have
father
said
tom
indignantly
i
think
she
in
the
house
perhaps
up
in
that
attic
said
tulliver
and
talking
to
herself
and
forgetting
all
about
you
go
and
fetch
her
down
tom
said
tulliver
rather
sharply
his
perspicacity
or
his
fatherly
fondness
for
maggie
making
him
suspect
that
the
lad
had
been
hard
upon
the
little
un
else
she
would
never
have
left
his
side
and
be
good
to
her
do
you
hear
else
i
let
you
know
better
tom
never
disobeyed
his
father
for
tulliver
was
a
peremptory
man
and
as
he
said
would
never
let
anybody
get
hold
of
his
but
he
went
out
rather
sullenly
carrying
his
piece
of
plumcake
and
not
intending
to
reprieve
maggie
punishment
which
was
no
more
than
she
deserved
tom
was
only
thirteen
and
had
no
decided
views
in
grammar
and
arithmetic
regarding
them
for
the
most
part
as
open
questions
but
he
was
particularly
clear
and
positive
on
one
point
namely
that
he
would
punish
everybody
who
deserved
it
why
he
would
have
minded
being
punished
himself
if
he
deserved
it
but
then
he
never
deserve
it
it
was
tom
step
then
that
maggie
heard
on
the
stairs
when
her
need
of
love
had
triumphed
over
her
pride
and
she
was
going
down
with
her
swollen
eyes
and
dishevelled
hair
to
beg
for
pity
at
least
her
father
would
stroke
her
head
and
say
never
mind
my
wench
it
is
a
wonderful
subduer
this
need
of
love
this
hunger
of
the
heart
as
peremptory
as
that
other
hunger
by
which
nature
forces
us
to
submit
to
the
yoke
and
change
the
face
of
the
world
but
she
knew
tom
step
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
violently
with
the
sudden
shock
of
hope
he
only
stood
still
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
said
maggie
you
to
come
down
but
she
rushed
to
him
and
clung
round
his
neck
sobbing
oh
tom
please
forgive
me
i
bear
it
i
will
always
be
good
always
remember
things
do
love
me
please
dear
tom
we
learn
to
restrain
ourselves
as
we
get
older
we
keep
apart
when
we
have
quarrelled
express
ourselves
in
phrases
and
in
this
way
preserve
a
dignified
alienation
showing
much
firmness
on
one
side
and
swallowing
much
grief
on
the
other
we
no
longer
approximate
in
our
behavior
to
the
mere
impulsiveness
of
the
lower
animals
but
conduct
ourselves
in
every
respect
like
members
of
a
highly
civilized
society
maggie
and
tom
were
still
very
much
like
young
animals
and
so
she
could
rub
her
cheek
against
his
and
kiss
his
ear
in
a
random
sobbing
way
and
there
were
tender
fibres
in
the
lad
that
had
been
used
to
answer
to
maggie
fondling
so
that
he
behaved
with
a
weakness
quite
inconsistent
with
his
resolution
to
punish
her
as
much
as
she
deserved
he
actually
began
to
kiss
her
in
return
and
say
do
cry
then
magsie
here
eat
a
bit
o
cake
maggie
sobs
began
to
subside
and
she
put
out
her
mouth
for
the
cake
and
bit
a
piece
and
then
tom
bit
a
piece
just
for
company
and
they
ate
together
and
rubbed
each
other
cheeks
and
brows
and
noses
together
while
they
ate
with
a
humiliating
resemblance
to
two
friendly
ponies
come
along
magsie
and
have
tea
said
tom
at
last
when
there
was
no
more
cake
except
what
was
so
ended
the
sorrows
of
this
day
and
the
next
morning
maggie
was
trotting
with
her
own
in
one
hand
and
a
handle
of
the
basket
in
the
other
stepping
always
by
a
peculiar
gift
in
the
muddiest
places
and
looking
darkly
radiant
from
under
her
because
tom
was
good
to
her
she
had
told
tom
however
that
she
should
like
him
to
put
the
worms
on
the
hook
for
her
although
she
accepted
his
word
when
he
assured
her
that
worms
feel
it
was
tom
private
opinion
that
it
did
much
matter
if
they
did
he
knew
all
about
worms
and
fish
and
those
things
and
what
birds
were
mischievous
and
how
padlocks
opened
and
which
way
the
handles
of
the
gates
were
to
be
lifted
maggie
thought
this
sort
of
knowledge
was
very
wonderful
much
more
difficult
than
remembering
what
was
in
the
books
and
she
was
rather
in
awe
of
tom
superiority
for
he
was
the
only
person
who
called
her
knowledge
stuff
and
did
not
feel
surprised
at
her
cleverness
tom
indeed
was
of
opinion
that
maggie
was
a
silly
little
thing
all
girls
were
silly
they
throw
a
stone
so
as
to
hit
anything
could
do
anything
with
a
and
were
frightened
at
frogs
still
he
was
very
fond
of
his
sister
and
meant
always
to
take
care
of
her
make
her
his
housekeeper
and
punish
her
when
she
did
wrong
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
round
pool
that
wonderful
pool
which
the
floods
had
made
a
long
while
ago
no
one
knew
how
deep
it
was
and
it
was
mysterious
too
that
it
should
be
almost
a
perfect
round
framed
in
with
willows
and
tall
reeds
so
that
the
water
was
only
to
be
seen
when
you
got
close
to
the
brink
the
sight
of
the
old
favorite
spot
always
heightened
tom
good
humor
and
he
spoke
to
maggie
in
the
most
amicable
whispers
as
he
opened
the
precious
basket
and
prepared
their
tackle
he
threw
her
line
for
her
and
put
the
rod
into
her
hand
maggie
thought
it
probable
that
the
small
fish
would
come
to
her
hook
and
the
large
ones
to
tom
but
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
fish
and
was
looking
dreamily
at
the
glassy
water
when
tom
said
in
a
loud
whisper
look
look
maggie
and
came
running
to
prevent
her
from
snatching
her
line
away
maggie
was
frightened
lest
she
had
been
doing
something
wrong
as
usual
but
presently
tom
drew
out
her
line
and
brought
a
large
tench
bouncing
on
the
grass
tom
was
excited
o
magsie
you
little
duck
empty
the
basket
maggie
was
not
conscious
of
unusual
merit
but
it
was
enough
that
tom
called
her
magsie
and
was
pleased
with
her
there
was
nothing
to
mar
her
delight
in
the
whispers
and
the
dreamy
silences
when
she
listened
to
the
light
dripping
sounds
of
the
rising
fish
and
the
gentle
rustling
as
if
the
willows
and
the
reeds
and
the
water
had
their
happy
whisperings
also
maggie
thought
it
would
make
a
very
nice
heaven
to
sit
by
the
pool
in
that
way
and
never
be
scolded
she
never
knew
she
had
a
bite
till
tom
told
her
but
she
liked
fishing
very
much
it
was
one
of
their
happy
mornings
they
trotted
along
and
sat
down
together
with
no
thought
that
life
would
ever
change
much
for
them
they
would
only
get
bigger
and
not
go
to
school
and
it
would
always
be
like
the
holidays
they
would
always
live
together
and
be
fond
of
each
other
and
the
mill
with
its
booming
the
great
under
which
they
played
at
houses
their
own
little
river
the
ripple
where
the
banks
seemed
like
home
and
tom
was
always
seeing
the
while
maggie
gathered
the
purple
plumy
tops
of
the
reeds
which
she
forgot
and
dropped
afterward
above
all
the
great
floss
along
which
they
wandered
with
a
sense
of
travel
to
see
the
rushing
the
awful
eagle
come
up
like
a
hungry
monster
or
to
see
the
great
ash
which
had
once
wailed
and
groaned
like
a
man
these
things
would
always
be
just
the
same
to
them
tom
thought
people
were
at
a
disadvantage
who
lived
on
any
other
spot
of
the
globe
and
maggie
when
she
read
about
christiana
passing
the
river
over
which
there
is
no
bridge
always
saw
the
floss
between
the
green
pastures
by
the
great
ash
life
did
change
for
tom
and
maggie
and
yet
they
were
not
wrong
in
believing
that
the
thoughts
and
loves
of
these
first
years
would
always
make
part
of
their
lives
we
could
never
have
loved
the
earth
so
well
if
we
had
had
no
childhood
in
it
if
it
were
not
the
earth
where
the
same
flowers
come
up
again
every
spring
that
we
used
to
gather
with
our
tiny
fingers
as
we
sat
lisping
to
ourselves
on
the
grass
the
same
hips
and
haws
on
the
autumn
hedgerows
the
same
redbreasts
that
we
used
to
call
god
birds
because
they
did
no
harm
to
the
precious
crops
what
novelty
is
worth
that
sweet
monotony
where
everything
is
known
and
because
it
is
known
the
wood
i
walk
in
on
this
mild
may
day
with
the
young
foliage
of
the
oaks
between
me
and
the
blue
sky
the
white
and
the
speedwell
and
the
ground
ivy
at
my
feet
what
grove
of
tropic
palms
what
strange
ferns
or
splendid
blossoms
could
ever
thrill
such
deep
and
delicate
fibres
within
me
as
this
home
scene
these
familiar
flowers
these
this
sky
with
its
fitful
brightness
these
furrowed
and
grassy
fields
each
with
a
sort
of
personality
given
to
it
by
the
capricious
hedgerows
such
things
as
these
are
the
of
our
imagination
the
language
that
is
laden
with
all
the
subtle
inextricable
associations
the
fleeting
hours
of
our
childhood
left
behind
them
our
delight
in
the
sunshine
on
the
grass
might
be
no
more
than
the
faint
perception
of
wearied
souls
if
it
were
not
for
the
sunshine
and
the
grass
in
the
years
which
still
live
in
us
and
transform
our
perception
into
love
chapter

kezia
the
housemaid
said
feeling
proud
to
live
under
a
mistress
who
could
make
such
pastry
so
that
no
season
or
circumstances
could
have
been
more
propitious
for
a
family
party
even
if
it
had
not
been
advisable
to
consult
sister
glegg
and
sister
pullet
about
tom
going
to

i
as

there
lucy

a
good
child

stool

hour
together
and
never

the
child
as

very
poor
color

of
our
family
sister
deane

well
as
i
do
as
sisters
and
sister

suit
well
together
well
well
do
as
you
like
bessy
said
tulliver
taking
up
his
hat
and
walking
out
to
the
mill
few
wives
were
more
submissive
than
tulliver
on
all
points
unconnected
with
her
family
relations
but
she
had
been
a
miss
dodson
and
the
dodsons
were
a
very
respectable
family
indeed
as
much
looked
up
to
as
any
in
their
own
parish
or
the
next
to
it
the
miss
dodsons
had
always
been
thought
to
hold
up
their
heads
very
high
and
no
one
was
surprised
the
two
eldest
had
married
so
well
not
at
an
early
age
for
that
was
not
the
practice
of
the
dodson
family
there
were
particular
ways
of
doing
everything
in
that
family
particular
ways
of
bleaching
the
linen
of
making
the
cowslip
wine
curing
the
hams
and
keeping
the
bottled
gooseberries
so
that
no
daughter
of
that
house
could
be
indifferent
to
the
privilege
of
having
been
born
a
dodson
rather
than
a
gibson
or
a
watson
funerals
were
always
conducted
with
peculiar
propriety
in
the
dodson
family
the
were
never
of
a
blue
shade
the
gloves
never
split
at
the
thumb
everybody
was
a
mourner
who
ought
to
be
and
there
were
always
scarfs
for
the
bearers
when
one
of
the
family
was
in
trouble
or
sickness
all
the
rest
went
to
visit
the
unfortunate
member
usually
at
the
same
time
and
did
not
shrink
from
uttering
the
most
disagreeable
truths
that
correct
family
feeling
dictated
if
the
illness
or
trouble
was
the
sufferer
own
fault
it
was
not
in
the
practice
of
the
dodson
family
to
shrink
from
saying
so
in
short
there
was
in
this
family
a
peculiar
tradition
as
to
what
was
the
right
thing
in
household
management
and
social
demeanor
and
the
only
bitter
circumstance
attending
this
superiority
was
a
painful
inability
to
approve
the
condiments
or
the
conduct
of
families
ungoverned
by
the
dodson
tradition
a
female
dodson
when
in
strange
houses
always
ate
dry
bread
with
her
tea
and
declined
any
sort
of
preserves
having
no
confidence
in
the
butter
and
thinking
that
the
preserves
had
probably
begun
to
ferment
from
want
of
due
sugar
and
boiling
there
were
some
dodsons
less
like
the
family
than
others
that
was
admitted
but
in
so
far
as
they
were
kin
they
were
of
necessity
better
than
those
who
were
no
kin
and
it
is
remarkable
that
while
no
individual
dodson
was
satisfied
with
any
other
individual
dodson
each
was
satisfied
not
only
with
him
or
her
self
but
with
the
dodsons
collectively
the
feeblest
member
of
a
family
the
one
who
has
the
least
character
is
often
the
merest
epitome
of
the
family
habits
and
traditions
and
tulliver
was
a
thorough
dodson
though
a
mild
one
as
so
long
as
it
is
anything
is
only
describable
as
very
weak
ale
and
though
she
had
groaned
a
little
in
her
youth
under
the
yoke
of
her
elder
sisters
and
still
shed
occasional
tears
at
their
sisterly
reproaches
it
was
not
in
tulliver
to
be
an
innovator
on
the
family
ideas
she
was
thankful
to
have
been
a
dodson
and
to
have
one
child
who
took
after
her
own
family
at
least
in
his
features
and
complexion
in
liking
salt
and
in
eating
beans
which
a
tulliver
never
did
in
other
respects
the
true
dodson
was
partly
latent
in
tom
and
he
was
as
far
from
appreciating
his
kin
on
the
mother
side
as
maggie
herself
generally
absconding
for
the
day
with
a
large
supply
of
the
most
portable
food
when
he
received
timely
warning
that
his
aunts
and
uncles
were
coming
a
moral
symptom
from
which
his
aunt
glegg
deduced
the
gloomiest
views
of
his
future
it
was
rather
hard
on
maggie
that
tom
always
absconded
without
letting
her
into
the
secret
but
the
weaker
sex
are
acknowledged
to
be
serious
in
cases
of
flight
on
wednesday
the
day
before
the
aunts
and
uncles
were
coming
there
were
such
various
and
suggestive
scents
as
of
plumcakes
in
the
oven
and
jellies
in
the
hot
state
mingled
with
the
aroma
of
gravy
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
altogether
gloomy
there
was
hope
in
the
air
tom
and
maggie
made
several
inroads
into
the
kitchen
and
like
other
marauders
were
induced
to
keep
aloof
for
a
time
only
by
being
allowed
to
carry
away
a
sufficient
load
of
booty
tom
said
maggie
as
they
sat
on
the
boughs
of
the
eating
their
shall
you
run
away
no
said
tom
slowly
when
he
had
finished
his
puff
and
was
eying
the
third
which
was
to
be
divided
between
them
no
i
why
tom
because
lucy
coming
no
said
tom
opening
his
and
holding
it
over
the
puff
with
his
head
on
one
side
in
a
dubitative
manner
it
was
a
difficult
problem
to
divide
that
very
irregular
polygon
into
two
equal
parts
what
do
care
about
lucy
she
only
a
girl
ca
play
at
bandy
is
it
the
then
said
maggie
exerting
her
hypothetic
powers
while
she
leaned
forward
toward
tom
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
hovering
knife
no
you
silly
that
be
good
the
day
after
it
the
pudden
i
know
what
the
pudden
to
be
apricot
o
my
buttons
with
this
interjection
the
knife
descended
on
the
puff
and
it
was
in
two
but
the
result
was
not
satisfactory
to
tom
for
he
still
eyed
the
halves
doubtfully
at
last
he
said
shut
your
eyes
maggie
what
for
you
never
mind
what
for
shut
when
i
tell
you
maggie
obeyed
now
which
you
have
maggie
right
hand
or
left
i
have
that
with
the
jam
run
out
said
maggie
keeping
her
eyes
shut
to
please
tom
why
you
do
like
that
you
silly
you
may
have
it
if
it
comes
to
you
fair
but
i
give
it
you
without
right
or
left
you
choose
now
said
tom
in
a
tone
of
exasperation
as
maggie
peeped
you
keep
your
eyes
shut
now
else
you
have
any
maggie
power
of
sacrifice
did
not
extend
so
far
indeed
i
fear
she
cared
less
that
tom
should
enjoy
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
puff
than
that
he
should
be
pleased
with
her
for
giving
him
the
best
bit
so
she
shut
her
eyes
quite
close
till
tom
told
her
to
say
which
and
then
she
said
left
hand
you
got
it
said
tom
in
rather
a
bitter
tone
what
the
bit
with
the
jam
run
out
no
here
take
it
said
tom
firmly
handing
decidedly
the
best
piece
to
maggie
oh
please
tom
have
it
i
do
mind
i
like
the
other
please
take
this
no
i
said
tom
almost
crossly
beginning
on
his
own
inferior
piece
maggie
thinking
it
was
no
use
to
contend
further
began
too
and
ate
up
her
half
puff
with
considerable
relish
as
well
as
rapidity
but
tom
had
finished
first
and
had
to
look
on
while
maggie
ate
her
last
morsel
or
two
feeling
in
himself
a
capacity
for
more
maggie
know
tom
was
looking
at
her
she
was
seesawing
on
the
lost
to
almost
everything
but
a
vague
sense
of
jam
and
idleness
oh
you
greedy
thing
said
tom
when
she
had
swallowed
the
last
morsel
he
was
conscious
of
having
acted
very
fairly
and
thought
she
ought
to
have
considered
this
and
made
up
to
him
for
it
he
would
have
refused
a
bit
of
hers
beforehand
but
one
is
naturally
at
a
different
point
of
view
before
and
after
one
own
share
of
puff
is
swallowed
maggie
turned
quite
pale
oh
tom
why
did
you
ask
me
i
was
going
to
ask
you
for
a
bit
you
greedy
you
might
have
thought
of
it
without
when
you
knew
i
gave
you
the
best
bit
but
i
wanted
you
to
have
it
you
know
i
did
said
maggie
in
an
injured
tone
yes
but
i
was
going
to
do
what
was
fair
like
spouncer
he
always
takes
the
best
bit
if
you
do
punch
him
for
it
and
if
you
choose
the
best
with
your
eyes
shut
he
changes
his
hands
but
if
i
go
halves
i
go
fair
only
i
would
be
a
greedy
with
this
cutting
innuendo
tom
jumped
down
from
his
bough
and
threw
a
stone
with
a
hoigh
as
a
friendly
attention
to
yap
who
had
also
been
looking
on
while
the
eatables
vanished
with
an
agitation
of
his
ears
and
feelings
which
could
hardly
have
been
without
bitterness
yet
the
excellent
dog
accepted
tom
attention
with
as
much
alacrity
as
if
he
had
been
treated
quite
generously
but
maggie
gifted
with
that
superior
power
of
misery
which
distinguishes
the
human
being
and
places
him
at
a
proud
distance
from
the
most
melancholy
chimpanzee
sat
still
on
her
bough
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
keen
sense
of
unmerited
reproach
she
would
have
given
the
world
not
to
have
eaten
all
her
puff
and
to
have
saved
some
of
it
for
tom
not
but
that
the
puff
was
very
nice
for
palate
was
not
at
all
obtuse
but
she
would
have
gone
without
it
many
times
over
sooner
than
tom
should
call
her
greedy
and
be
cross
with
her
and
he
had
said
he
would
have
it
and
she
ate
it
without
thinking
how
could
she
help
it
the
tears
flowed
so
plentifully
that
maggie
saw
nothing
around
her
for
the
next
ten
minutes
but
by
that
time
resentment
began
to
give
way
to
the
desire
of
reconciliation
and
she
jumped
from
her
bough
to
look
for
tom
he
was
no
longer
in
the
paddock
behind
the
rickyard
where
was
he
likely
to
be
gone
and
yap
with
him
maggie
ran
to
the
high
bank
against
the
great
where
she
could
see
far
away
toward
the
floss
there
was
tom
but
her
heart
sank
again
as
she
saw
how
far
off
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
great
river
and
that
he
had
another
companion
besides
yap
naughty
bob
jakin
whose
official
if
not
natural
function
of
frightening
the
birds
was
just
now
at
a
standstill
maggie
felt
sure
that
bob
was
wicked
without
very
distinctly
knowing
why
unless
it
was
because
bob
mother
was
a
dreadfully
large
fat
woman
who
lived
at
a
queer
round
house
down
the
river
and
once
when
maggie
and
tom
had
wandered
thither
there
rushed
out
a
brindled
dog
that
would
stop
barking
and
when
bob
mother
came
out
after
it
and
screamed
above
the
barking
to
tell
them
not
to
be
frightened
maggie
thought
she
was
scolding
them
fiercely
and
her
heart
beat
with
terror
maggie
thought
it
very
likely
that
the
round
house
had
snakes
on
the
floor
and
bats
in
the
bedroom
for
she
had
seen
bob
take
off
his
cap
to
show
tom
a
little
snake
that
was
inside
it
and
another
time
he
had
a
handful
of
young
bats
altogether
he
was
an
irregular
character
perhaps
even
slightly
diabolical
judging
from
his
intimacy
with
snakes
and
bats
and
to
crown
all
when
tom
had
bob
for
a
companion
he
did
mind
about
maggie
and
would
never
let
her
go
with
him
it
must
be
owned
that
tom
was
fond
of
bob
company
how
could
it
be
otherwise
bob
knew
directly
he
saw
a
bird
egg
whether
it
was
a
swallow
or
a
tomtit
or
a
he
found
out
all
the
wasps
nests
and
could
set
all
sort
of
traps
he
could
climb
the
trees
like
a
squirrel
and
had
quite
a
magical
power
of
detecting
hedgehogs
and
stoats
and
he
had
courage
to
do
things
that
were
rather
naughty
such
as
making
gaps
in
the
hedgerows
throwing
stones
after
the
sheep
and
killing
a
cat
that
was
wandering
such
qualities
in
an
inferior
who
could
always
be
treated
with
authority
in
spite
of
his
superior
knowingness
had
necessarily
a
fatal
fascination
for
tom
and
every
maggie
was
sure
to
have
days
of
grief
because
he
had
gone
off
with
bob
well
there
was
no
hope
for
it
he
was
gone
now
and
maggie
could
think
of
no
comfort
but
to
sit
down
by
the
hollow
or
wander
by
the
hedgerow
and
fancy
it
was
all
different
refashioning
her
little
world
into
just
what
she
should
like
it
to
be
maggie
was
a
troublous
life
and
this
was
the
form
in
which
she
took
her
opium
meanwhile
tom
forgetting
all
about
maggie
and
the
sting
of
reproach
which
he
had
left
in
her
heart
was
hurrying
along
with
bob
whom
he
had
met
accidentally
to
the
scene
of
a
great
in
a
neighboring
barn
bob
knew
all
about
this
particular
affair
and
spoke
of
the
sport
with
an
enthusiasm
which
no
one
who
is
not
either
divested
of
all
manly
feeling
or
pitiably
ignorant
of
can
fail
to
imagine
for
a
person
suspected
of
preternatural
wickedness
bob
was
really
not
so
very
there
was
even
something
agreeable
in
his
face
with
its
border
of
red
hair
but
then
his
trousers
were
always
rolled
up
at
the
knee
for
the
convenience
of
wading
on
the
slightest
notice
and
his
virtue
supposing
it
to
exist
was
undeniably
virtue
in
rags
which
on
the
authority
even
of
bilious
philosophers
who
think
all
merit
overpaid
is
notoriously
likely
to
remain
unrecognized
perhaps
because
it
is
seen
so
seldom
i
know
the
chap
as
owns
the
ferrets
said
bob
in
a
hoarse
treble
voice
as
he
shuffled
along
keeping
his
blue
eyes
fixed
on
the
river
like
an
amphibious
animal
who
foresaw
occasion
for
darting
in
he
lives
up
the
kennel
yard
at
sut
ogg
he
does
he
the
biggest
anywhere
he
is
i
sooner
be
a
nor
anything
i
would
the
moles
is
nothing
to
the
rots
but
lors
you
mun
ha
ferrets
dogs
is
no
good
why
there
that
dog
now
bob
continued
pointing
with
an
air
of
disgust
toward
yap
he
no
more
good
wi
a
rot
nor
nothin
i
see
it
myself
i
did
at
the
i
your
feyther
barn
yap
feeling
the
withering
influence
of
this
scorn
tucked
his
tail
in
and
shrank
close
to
tom
leg
who
felt
a
little
hurt
for
him
but
had
not
the
superhuman
courage
to
seem
behindhand
with
bob
in
contempt
for
a
dog
who
made
so
poor
a
figure
no
no
he
said
yap
no
good
at
sport
i
have
regular
good
dogs
for
rats
and
everything
when
i
done
school
hev
ferrets
measter
tom
said
bob
eagerly
them
white
ferrets
wi
pink
eyes
lors
you
might
catch
your
own
rots
an
you
might
put
a
rot
in
a
cage
wi
a
ferret
an
see
fight
you
might
what
i
do
i
know
an
it
be
better
fun
nor
seein
two
chaps
fight
if
it
was
them
chaps
as
sold
cakes
an
oranges
at
the
fair
as
the
things
flew
out
o
their
baskets
an
some
o
the
cakes
was
smashed
but
they
tasted
just
as
good
added
bob
by
way
of
note
or
addendum
after
a
moment
pause
but
i
say
bob
said
tom
in
a
tone
of
deliberation
ferrets
are
nasty
biting
things
they
bite
a
fellow
without
being
set
on
lors
why
that
the
beauty
on
if
a
chap
lays
hold
o
your
ferret
he
wo
be
long
before
he
hollows
out
a
good
un
wo
at
this
moment
a
striking
incident
made
the
boys
pause
suddenly
in
their
walk
it
was
the
plunging
of
some
small
body
in
the
water
from
among
the
neighboring
bulrushes
if
it
was
not
a
bob
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
undergo
the
most
unpleasant
consequences
hoigh
yap
hoigh
there
he
is
said
tom
clapping
his
hands
as
the
little
black
snout
made
its
arrowy
course
to
the
opposite
bank
seize
him
lad
seize
him
yap
agitated
his
ears
and
wrinkled
his
brows
but
declined
to
plunge
trying
whether
barking
would
not
answer
the
purpose
just
as
well
ugh
you
coward
said
tom
and
kicked
him
over
feeling
humiliated
as
a
sportsman
to
possess
so
an
animal
bob
abstained
from
remark
and
passed
on
choosing
however
to
walk
in
the
shallow
edge
of
the
overflowing
river
by
way
of
change
he
none
so
full
now
the
floss
is
said
bob
as
he
kicked
the
water
up
before
him
with
an
agreeable
sense
of
being
insolent
to
it
why
last
the
meadows
was
all
one
sheet
o
water
they
was
ay
but
said
tom
whose
mind
was
prone
to
see
an
opposition
between
statements
that
were
really
accordant
but
there
was
a
big
flood
once
when
the
round
pool
was
made
know
there
was
father
says
so
and
the
sheep
and
cows
all
drowned
and
the
boats
went
all
over
the
fields
ever
such
a
way
do
care
about
a
flood
comin
said
bob
i
do
mind
the
water
no
more
nor
the
land
i
swim
would
ah
but
if
you
got
nothing
to
eat
for
ever
so
long
said
tom
his
imagination
becoming
quite
active
under
the
stimulus
of
that
dread
when
i
a
man
i
shall
make
a
boat
with
a
wooden
house
on
the
top
of
it
like
noah
ark
and
keep
plenty
to
eat
in
it
rabbits
and
things
all
ready
and
then
if
the
flood
came
you
know
bob
i
should
mind
and
i
take
you
in
if
i
saw
you
swimming
he
added
in
the
tone
of
a
benevolent
patron
i
are
frighted
said
bob
to
whom
hunger
did
not
appear
so
appalling
but
i
get
in
an
knock
the
rabbits
on
th
head
when
you
wanted
to
eat
ah
and
i
should
have
halfpence
and
we
play
at
said
tom
not
contemplating
the
possibility
that
this
recreation
might
have
fewer
charms
for
his
mature
age
i
divide
fair
to
begin
with
and
then
we
see
who
win
i
got
a
halfpenny
o
my
own
said
bob
proudly
coming
out
of
the
water
and
tossing
his
halfpenny
in
the
air
yeads
or
tails
tails
said
tom
instantly
fired
with
the
desire
to
win
it
yeads
said
bob
hastily
snatching
up
the
halfpenny
as
it
fell
it
was
said
tom
loudly
and
peremptorily
you
give
me
the
halfpenny
i
won
it
fair
i
said
bob
holding
it
tight
in
his
pocket
then
i
make
you
see
if
i
do
said
tom
yes
i
can
you
ca
make
me
do
nothing
you
ca
said
bob
no
you
ca
i
master
i
do
care
for
you
but
i
make
you
care
you
cheat
said
tom
collaring
bob
and
shaking
him
you
get
out
wi
you
said
bob
giving
tom
a
kick
tom
blood
was
thoroughly
up
he
went
at
bob
with
a
lunge
and
threw
him
down
but
bob
seized
hold
and
kept
it
like
a
cat
and
pulled
tom
down
after
him
they
struggled
fiercely
on
the
ground
for
a
moment
or
two
till
tom
pinning
bob
down
by
the
shoulders
thought
he
had
the
mastery
say
you
give
me
the
halfpenny
now
he
said
with
difficulty
while
he
exerted
himself
to
keep
the
command
of
arms
but
at
this
moment
yap
who
had
been
running
on
before
returned
barking
to
the
scene
of
action
and
saw
a
favorable
opportunity
for
biting
bob
bare
leg
not
only
with
inpunity
but
with
honor
the
pain
from
yap
teeth
instead
of
surprising
bob
into
a
relaxation
of
his
hold
gave
it
a
fiercer
tenacity
and
with
a
new
exertion
of
his
force
he
pushed
tom
backward
and
got
uppermost
but
now
yap
who
could
get
no
sufficient
purchase
before
set
his
teeth
in
a
new
place
so
that
bob
harassed
in
this
way
let
go
his
hold
of
tom
and
almost
throttling
yap
flung
him
into
the
river
by
this
time
tom
was
up
again
and
before
bob
had
quite
recovered
his
balance
after
the
act
of
swinging
yap
tom
fell
upon
him
threw
him
down
and
got
his
knees
firmly
on
bob
chest
you
give
me
the
halfpenny
now
said
tom
take
it
said
bob
sulkily
no
i
take
it
you
give
it
me
bob
took
the
halfpenny
out
of
his
pocket
and
threw
it
away
from
him
on
the
ground
tom
loosed
his
hold
and
left
bob
to
rise
there
the
halfpenny
lies
he
said
i
do
want
your
halfpenny
i
would
have
kept
it
but
you
wanted
to
cheat
i
hate
a
cheat
i
go
along
with
you
any
more
he
added
turning
round
homeward
not
without
casting
a
regret
toward
the
and
other
pleasures
which
he
must
relinquish
along
with
bob
society
you
may
let
it
alone
then
bob
called
out
after
him
i
shall
cheat
if
i
like
there
no
fun
i
playing
else
and
i
know
where
there
a
goldfinch
nest
but
i
take
care
do
an
you
a
nasty
fightin
you
are
tom
walked
on
without
looking
around
and
yap
followed
his
example
the
cold
bath
having
moderated
his
passions
go
along
wi
you
then
wi
your
drowned
dog
i
would
own
such
a
dog
would
said
bob
getting
louder
in
a
last
effort
to
sustain
his
defiance
but
tom
was
not
to
be
provoked
into
turning
round
and
bob
voice
began
to
falter
a
little
as
he
said
an
you
everything
an
showed
you
everything
an
niver
wanted
nothin
from
you
an
there
your
knife
then
as
you
me
here
bob
flung
the
knife
as
far
as
he
could
after
retreating
footsteps
but
it
produced
no
effect
except
the
sense
in
bob
mind
that
there
was
a
terrible
void
in
his
lot
now
that
knife
was
gone
he
stood
still
till
tom
had
passed
through
the
gate
and
disappeared
behind
the
hedge
the
knife
would
do
not
good
on
the
ground
there
it
would
vex
tom
and
pride
or
resentment
was
a
feeble
passion
in
bob
mind
compared
with
the
love
of
a
his
very
fingers
sent
entreating
thrills
that
he
would
go
and
clutch
that
familiar
rough
handle
which
they
had
so
often
grasped
for
mere
affection
as
it
lay
idle
in
his
pocket
and
there
were
two
blades
and
they
had
just
been
sharpened
what
is
life
without
a
to
him
who
has
once
tasted
a
higher
existence
no
to
throw
the
handle
after
the
hatchet
is
a
comprehensible
act
of
desperation
but
to
throw
one
after
an
implacable
friend
is
clearly
in
every
sense
a
hyperbole
or
throwing
beyond
the
mark
so
bob
shuffled
back
to
the
spot
where
the
beloved
knife
lay
in
the
dirt
and
felt
quite
a
new
pleasure
in
clutching
it
again
after
the
temporary
separation
in
opening
one
blade
after
the
other
and
feeling
their
edge
with
his
thumb
poor
bob
he
was
not
sensitive
on
the
point
of
honor
not
a
chivalrous
character
that
fine
moral
aroma
would
not
have
been
thought
much
of

the
public
opinion
of
kennel
yard
which
was
the
very
focus
or
heart
of
bob
world
even
if
it
could
have
made
itself
perceptible
there
yet
for
all
that
he
was
not
utterly
a
sneak
and
a
thief
as
our
friend
tom
had
hastily
decided
but
tom
you
perceive
was
rather
a
rhadamanthine
personage
having
more
than
the
usual
share
of
boy
justice
in
him
the
justice
that
desires
to
hurt
culprits
as
much
as
they
deserve
to
be
hurt
and
is
troubled
with
no
doubts
concerning
the
exact
amount
of
their
deserts
maggie
saw
a
cloud
on
his
brow
when
he
came
home
which
checked
her
joy
at
his
coming
so
much
sooner
than
she
had
expected
and
she
dared
hardly
speak
to
him
as
he
stood
silently
throwing
the
small
into
the
it
is
not
pleasant
to
give
up
a
when
you
have
set
your
mind
on
it
but
if
tom
had
told
his
strongest
feeling
at
that
moment
he
would
have
said
i
do
just
the
same
again
that
was
his
usual
mode
of
viewing
his
past
actions
whereas
maggie
was
always
wishing
she
had
done
something
different
chapter
vii
enter
the
aunts
and
uncles
the
dodsons
were
certainly
a
handsome
family
and
glegg
was
not
the
least
handsome
of
the
sisters
as
she
sat
in
no
impartial
observer
could
have
denied
that
for
a
woman
of
fifty
she
had
a
very
comely
face
and
figure
though
tom
and
maggie
considered
their
aunt
glegg
as
the
type
of
ugliness
it
is
true
she
despised
the
advantages
of
costume
for
though
as
she
often
observed
no
woman
had
better
clothes
it
was
not
her
way
to
wear
her
new
things
out
before
her
old
ones
other
women
if
they
liked
might
have
their
best
in
every
wash
but
when
glegg
died
it
would
be
found
that
she
had
better
lace
laid
by
in
the
drawer
of
her
wardrobe
in
the
spotted
chamber
than
ever
wooll
of
ogg
had
bought
in
her
life
although
wooll
wore
her
lace
before
it
was
paid
for
so
of
her
curled
fronts
glegg
had
doubtless
the
glossiest
and
crispest
brown
curls
in
her
drawers
as
well
as
curls
in
various
degrees
of
fuzzy
laxness
but
to
look
out
on
the
world
from
under
a
crisp
and
glossy
front
would
be
to
introduce
a
most
dreamlike
and
unpleasant
confusion
between
the
sacred
and
the
secular
occasionally
indeed
glegg
wore
one
of
her
fronts
on
a
visit
but
not
at
a
sister
house
especially
not
at
tulliver
who
since
her
marriage
had
hurt
her
sister
feelings
greatly
by
wearing
her
own
hair
though
as
glegg
observed
to
deane
a
mother
of
a
family
like
bessy
with
a
husband
always
going
to
law
might
have
been
expected
to
know
better
but
bessy
was
always
weak
so
if
glegg
front
was
more
fuzzy
and
lax
than
usual
she
had
a
design
under
it
she
intended
the
most
pointed
and
cutting
allusion
to
tulliver
bunches
of
blond
curls
separated
from
each
other
by
a
due
wave
of
smoothness
on
each
side
of
the
parting
tulliver
had
shed
tears
several
times
at
sister
unkindness
on
the
subject
of
these
unmatronly
curls
but
the
consciousness
of
looking
the
handsomer
for
them
naturally
administered
support
glegg
chose
to
wear
her
bonnet
in
the
house
untied
and
tilted
slightly
of
course
a
frequent
practice
of
hers
when
she
was
on
a
visit
and
happened
to
be
in
a
severe
humor
she
did
know
what
draughts
there
might
be
in
strange
houses
for
the
same
reason
she
wore
a
small
sable
tippet
which
reached
just
to
her
shoulders
and
was
very
far
from
meeting
across
her
chest
while
her
long
neck
was
protected
by
a
of
miscellaneous
frilling
one
would
need
to
be
learned
in
the
fashions
of
those
times
to
know
how
far
in
the
rear
of
them
silk
gown
must
have
been
but
from
certain
constellations
of
small
yellow
spots
upon
it
and
a
mouldy
odor
about
it
suggestive
of
a
damp
it
was
probable
that
it
belonged
to
a
stratum
of
garments
just
old
enough
to
have
come
recently
into
wear
glegg
held
her
large
gold
watch
in
her
hand
with
the
chain
round
her
fingers
and
observed
to
tulliver
who
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
that
whatever
it
might
be
by
other
people
clocks
and
watches
it
was
gone
twelve
by
hers
i
do
know
what
ails
sister
pullet
she
continued
it
used
to
be
the
way
in
our
family
for
one
to
be
as
early
as
another
i
sure
it
was
so
in
my
poor
father
time
and
not
for
one
sister
to
sit
half
an
hour
before
the
others
came
but
if
the
ways
o
the
family
are
altered
it
be
fault
never
be
the
one
to
come
into
a
house
when
all
the
rest
are
going
away
i
wonder
sister
deane
she
used
to
be
more
like
me
but
if
you
take
my
advice
bessy
you
put
the
dinner
forrard
a
bit
sooner
than
put
it
back
because
folks
are
late
as
ought
to
ha
known
better
oh
dear
there
no
fear
but
what
they
be
all
here
in
time
sister
said
tulliver
in
her
tone
the
dinner
wo
be
ready
till
one
but
if
it
long
for
you
to
wait
let
me
fetch
you
a
cheesecake
and
a
glass
o
wine
well
bessy
said
glegg
with
a
bitter
smile
and
a
scarcely
perceptible
toss
of
her
head
i
should
ha
thought
you
known
your
own
sister
better
i
never
eat
between
meals
and
i
not
going
to
begin
not
but
what
i
hate
that
nonsense
of
having
your
dinner
at
one
when
you
might
have
it
at
one
you
was
never
brought
up
in
that
way
bessy
why
jane
what
can
i
do
tulliver
does
like
his
dinner
before
two
but
i
put
it
half
an
hour
earlier
because
o
you
yes
yes
i
know
how
it
is
with
husbands
they
for
putting
everything
off
they
put
the
dinner
off
till
after
tea
if
got
wives
as
are
weak
enough
to
give
in
to
such
work
but
it
a
pity
for
you
bessy
as
you
have
got
more
strength
o
mind
it
be
well
if
your
children
do
suffer
for
it
and
i
hope
you
not
gone
and
got
a
great
dinner
for
us
going
to
expense
for
your
sisters
as
sooner
eat
a
crust
o
dry
bread
nor
help
to
ruin
you
with
extravagance
i
wonder
you
do
take
pattern
by
your
sister
deane
she
far
more
sensible
and
here
you
got
two
children
to
provide
for
and
your
husband
spent
your
fortin
i
going
to
law
likely
to
spend
his
own
too
a
boiled
joint
as
you
could
make
broth
of
for
the
kitchen
glegg
added
in
a
tone
of
emphatic
protest
and
a
plain
pudding
with
a
spoonful
o
sugar
and
no
spice
be
far
more
becoming
with
sister
glegg
in
this
humor
there
was
a
cheerful
prospect
for
the
day
tulliver
never
went
the
length
of
quarrelling
with
her
any
more
than
a
that
puts
out
its
leg
in
a
deprecating
manner
can
be
said
to
quarrel
with
a
boy
who
throws
stones
but
this
point
of
the
dinner
was
a
tender
one
and
not
at
all
new
so
that
tulliver
could
make
the
same
answer
she
had
often
made
before
tulliver
says
he
always
have
a
good
dinner
for
his
friends
while
he
can
pay
for
it
she
said
and
he
a
right
to
do
as
he
likes
in
his
own
house
sister
well
bessy
ca
leave
your
children
enough
out
o
my
savings
to
keep
from
ruin
and
you
must
look
to
having
any
o
glegg
money
for
it
well
if
i
do
go
first
he
comes
of
a
family
and
if
he
was
to
die
and
leave
me
well
for
my
life
he
tie
all
the
money
up
to
go
back
to
his
own
kin
the
sound
of
wheels
while
glegg
was
speaking
was
an
interruption
highly
welcome
to
tulliver
who
hastened
out
to
receive
sister
pullet
it
must
be
sister
pullet
because
the
sound
was
that
of
a
glegg
tossed
her
head
and
looked
rather
sour
about
the
mouth
at
the
thought
of
the
she
had
a
strong
opinion
on
that
subject
sister
pullet
was
in
tears
when
the
chaise
stopped
before
tulliver
door
and
it
was
apparently
requisite
that
she
should
shed
a
few
more
before
getting
out
for
though
her
husband
and
tulliver
stood
ready
to
support
her
she
sat
still
and
shook
her
head
sadly
as
she
looked
through
her
tears
at
the
vague
distance
why
whativer
is
the
matter
sister
said
tulliver
she
was
not
an
imaginative
woman
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
large
in
sister
pullet
best
bedroom
was
possibly
broken
for
the
second
time
there
was
no
reply
but
a
further
shake
of
the
head
as
pullet
slowly
rose
and
got
down
from
the
chaise
not
without
casting
a
glance
at
pullet
to
see
that
he
was
guarding
her
handsome
silk
dress
from
injury
pullet
was
a
small
man
with
a
high
nose
small
twinkling
eyes
and
thin
lips
in
a
suit
of
black
and
a
white
cravat
that
seemed
to
have
been
tied
very
tight
on
some
higher
principle
than
that
of
mere
personal
ease
he
bore
about
the
same
relation
to
his
tall
wife
with
her
balloon
sleeves
abundant
mantle
and
a
large
befeathered
and
beribboned
bonnet
as
a
small
bears
to
a
brig
with
all
its
sails
spread
it
is
a
pathetic
sight
and
a
striking
example
of
the
complexity
introduced
into
the
emotions
by
a
high
state
of
civilization
the
sight
of
a
fashionably
dressed
female
in
grief
from
the
sorrow
of
a
hottentot
to
that
of
a
woman
in
large
buckram
sleeves
with
several
bracelets
on
each
arm
an
architectural
bonnet
and
delicate
ribbon
strings
what
a
long
series
of
gradations
in
the
enlightened
child
of
civilization
the
abandonment
characteristic
of
grief
is
checked
and
varied
in
the
subtlest
manner
so
as
to
present
an
interesting
problem
to
the
analytic
mind
if
with
a
crushed
heart
and
eyes
half
blinded
by
the
mist
of
tears
she
were
to
walk
with
a
step
through
a
she
might
crush
her
buckram
sleeves
too
and
the
deep
consciousness
of
this
possibility
produces
a
composition
of
forces
by
which
she
takes
a
line
that
just
clears
the
perceiving
that
the
tears
are
hurrying
fast
she
unpins
her
strings
and
throws
them
languidly
backward
a
touching
gesture
indicative
even
in
the
deepest
gloom
of
the
hope
in
future
dry
moments
when
will
once
more
have
a
charm
as
the
tears
subside
a
little
and
with
her
head
leaning
backward
at
the
angle
that
will
not
injure
her
bonnet
she
endures
that
terrible
moment
when
grief
which
has
made
all
things
else
a
weariness
has
itself
become
weary
she
looks
down
pensively
at
her
bracelets
and
adjusts
their
clasps
with
that
pretty
studied
fortuity
which
would
be
gratifying
to
her
mind
if
it
were
once
more
in
a
calm
and
healthy
state
pullet
brushed
each
with
great
nicety
about
the
latitude
of
her
shoulders
at
that
period
a
woman
was
truly
ridiculous
to
an
instructed
eye
if
she
did
not
measure
a
yard
and
a
half
across
the
shoulders
and
having
done
that
sent
the
muscles
of
her
face
in
quest
of
fresh
tears
as
she
advanced
into
the
parlor
where
glegg
was
seated
well
sister
you
late
what
the
matter
said
glegg
rather
sharply
as
they
shook
hands
pullet
sat
down
lifting
up
her
mantle
carefully
behind
before
she
answered
she
gone
unconsciously
using
an
impressive
figure
of
rhetoric
it
is
the
glass
this
time
then
thought
tulliver
died
the
day
before
yesterday
continued
pullet
an
her
legs
was
as
thick
as
my
body
she
added
with
deep
sadness
after
a
pause
they
tapped
her
no
end
o
times
and
the
water
they
say
you
might
ha
swum
in
it
if
you
liked
well
sophy
it
a
mercy
she
gone
then
whoever
she
may
be
said
glegg
with
the
promptitude
and
emphasis
of
a
mind
naturally
clear
and
decided
but
i
ca
think
who
you
talking
of
for
my
part
but
know
said
pullet
sighing
and
shaking
her
head
and
there
is
another
such
a
dropsy
in
the
parish
know
as
it
old
sutton
o
the
twentylands
well
she
no
kin
o
yours
nor
much
acquaintance
as
i
ever
heared
of
said
glegg
who
always
cried
just
as
much
as
was
proper
when
anything
happened
to
her
own
kin
but
not
on
other
occasions
she
so
much
acquaintance
as
i
seen
her
legs
when
they
was
like
bladders
and
an
old
lady
as
had
doubled
her
money
over
and
over
again
and
kept
it
all
in
her
own
management
to
the
last
and
had
her
pocket
with
her
keys
in
under
her
pillow
constant
there
is
many
old
like
her
i
doubt
and
they
say
she
took
as
much
physic
as
fill
a
wagon
observed
pullet
ah
sighed
pullet
she
another
complaint
ever
so
many
years
before
she
had
the
dropsy
and
the
doctors
could
make
out
what
it
was
and
she
said
to
me
when
i
went
to
see
her
last
christmas
she
said
pullet
if
ever
you
have
the
dropsy
you
think
o
me
she
say
so
added
pullet
beginning
to
cry
bitterly
again
those
were
her
very
words
and
she
to
be
buried
o
saturday
and
pullet
bid
to
the
funeral
sophy
said
glegg
unable
any
longer
to
contain
her
spirit
of
rational
remonstrance
sophy
i
wonder
you
fretting
and
injuring
your
health
about
people
as
do
belong
to
you
your
poor
father
never
did
so
nor
your
aunt
frances
neither
nor
any
o
the
family
as
i
ever
heard
of
you
could
fret
no
more
than
this
if
we
heared
as
our
cousin
abbott
had
died
sudden
without
making
his
will
pullet
was
silent
having
to
finish
her
crying
and
rather
flattered
than
indignant
at
being
upbraided
for
crying
too
much
it
was
not
everybody
who
could
afford
to
cry
so
much
about
their
neighbors
who
had
left
them
nothing
but
pullet
had
married
a
gentleman
farmer
and
had
leisure
and
money
to
carry
her
crying
and
everything
else
to
the
highest
pitch
of
respectability
sutton
did
die
without
making
her
will
though
said
pullet
with
a
confused
sense
that
he
was
saying
something
to
sanction
his
wife
tears
ours
is
a
rich
parish
but
they
say
there
nobody
else
to
leave
as
many
thousands
behind
as
sutton
and
left
no
leggicies
to
speak
on
left
it
all
in
a
lump
to
her
nevvy
there
was
much
good
i
being
so
rich
then
said
glegg
if
she
got
none
but
husband
kin
to
leave
it
to
it
poor
work
when
that
all
you
got
to
pinch
yourself
for
not
as
i
one
o
those
as
like
to
die
without
leaving
more
money
out
at
interest
than
other
folks
had
reckoned
but
it
a
poor
tale
when
it
must
go
out
your
own
family
i
sure
sister
said
pullet
who
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
take
off
her
veil
and
fold
it
carefully
it
a
nice
sort
o
man
as
sutton
has
left
her
money
to
for
he
troubled
with
the
asthmy
and
goes
to
bed
every
night
at
eight
he
told
me
about
it
himself
as
free
as
could
be
one
sunday
when
he
came
to
our
church
he
wears
a
hareskin
on
his
chest
and
has
a
trembling
in
his
talk
quite
a
gentleman
sort
o
man
i
told
him
there
was
many
months
in
the
year
as
i
was
under
the
doctor
hands
and
he
said
pullet
i
can
feel
for
you
that
was
what
he
said
the
very
words
ah
sighed
pullet
shaking
her
head
at
the
idea
that
there
were
but
few
who
could
enter
fully
into
her
experiences
in
pink
mixture
and
white
mixture
strong
stuff
in
small
bottles
and
weak
stuff

sister
i
may
as
well
go
and
take
my
bonnet
off
now
did
you
see
as
the
was
put
out
she
added
turning
to
her
husband
pullet
by
an
unaccountable
lapse
of
memory
had
forgotten
it
and
hastened
out
with
a
stricken
conscience
to
remedy
the
omission
they
bring
it
upstairs
sister
said
tulliver
wishing
to
go
at
once
lest
glegg
should
begin
to
explain
her
feelings
about
sophy
being
the
first
dodson
who
ever
ruined
her
constitution
with
doctor
stuff
tulliver
was
fond
of
going
upstairs
with
her
sister
pullet
and
looking
thoroughly
at
her
cap
before
she
put
it
on
her
head
and
discussing
millinery
in
general
this
was
part
of
bessy
weakness
that
stirred
glegg
sisterly
compassion
bessy
went
far
too
well
dressed
considering
and
she
was
too
proud
to
dress
her
child
in
the
good
clothing
her
sister
glegg
gave
her
from
the
primeval
strata
of
her
wardrobe
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
buy
anything
to
dress
that
child
if
it
was
a
pair
of
shoes
in
this
particular
however
glegg
did
her
sister
bessy
some
injustice
for
tulliver
had
really
made
great
efforts
to
induce
maggie
to
wear
a
leghorn
bonnet
and
a
dyed
silk
frock
made
out
of
her
aunt
glegg
but
the
results
had
been
such
that
tulliver
was
obliged
to
bury
them
in
her
maternal
bosom
for
maggie
declaring
that
the
frock
smelt
of
nasty
dye
had
taken
an
opportunity
of
basting
it
together
with
the
roast
beef
the
first
sunday
she
wore
it
and
finding
this
scheme
answer
she
had
subsequently
pumped
on
the
bonnet
with
its
green
ribbons
so
as
to
give
it
a
general
resemblance
to
a
sage
cheese
garnished
with
withered
lettuces
i
must
urge
in
excuse
for
maggie
that
tom
had
laughed
at
her
in
the
bonnet
and
said
she
looked
like
an
old
judy
aunt
pullet
too
made
presents
of
clothes
but
these
were
always
pretty
enough
to
please
maggie
as
well
as
her
mother
of
all
her
sisters
tulliver
certainly
preferred
her
sister
pullet
not
without
a
return
of
preference
but
pullet
was
sorry
bessy
had
those
naughty
awkward
children
she
would
do
the
best
she
could
by
them
but
it
was
a
pity
they
were
as
good
and
as
pretty
as
sister
deane
child
maggie
and
tom
on
their
part
thought
their
aunt
pullet
tolerable
chiefly
because
she
was
not
their
aunt
glegg
tom
always
declined
to
go
more
than
once
during
his
holidays
to
see
either
of
them
both
his
uncles
tipped
him
that
once
of
course
but
at
his
aunt
pullet
there
were
a
great
many
toads
to
pelt
in
the
so
that
he
preferred
the
visit
to
her
maggie
shuddered
at
the
toads
and
dreamed
of
them
horribly
but
she
liked
her
uncle
pullet
musical
still
it
was
agreed
by
the
sisters
in
tulliver
absence
that
the
tulliver
blood
did
not
mix
well
with
the
dodson
blood
that
in
fact
poor
bessy
children
were
tullivers
and
that
tom
notwithstanding
he
had
the
dodson
complexion
was
likely
to
be
as
contrairy
as
his
father
as
for
maggie
she
was
the
picture
of
her
aunt
moss
tulliver
sister
a
woman
who
had
married
as
poorly
as
could
be
had
no
china
and
had
a
husband
who
had
much
ado
to
pay
his
rent
but
when
pullet
was
alone
with
tulliver
upstairs
the
remarks
were
naturally
to
the
disadvantage
of
glegg
and
they
agreed
in
confidence
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
sort
of
fright
sister
jane
would
come
out
next
but
their
was
curtailed
by
the
appearance
of
deane
with
little
lucy
and
tulliver
had
to
look
on
with
a
silent
pang
while
lucy
blond
curls
were
adjusted
it
was
quite
unaccountable
that
deane
the
thinnest
and
sallowest
of
all
the
miss
dodsons
should
have
had
this
child
who
might
have
been
taken
for
tulliver
any
day
and
maggie
always
looked
twice
as
dark
as
usual
when
she
was
by
the
side
of
lucy
she
did
when
she
and
tom
came
in
from
the
garden
with
their
father
and
their
uncle
glegg
maggie
had
thrown
her
bonnet
off
very
carelessly
and
coming
in
with
her
hair
rough
as
well
as
out
of
curl
rushed
at
once
to
lucy
who
was
standing
by
her
mother
knee
certainly
the
contrast
between
the
cousins
was
conspicuous
and
to
superficial
eyes
was
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
maggie
though
a
connoisseur
might
have
seen
points
in
her
which
had
a
higher
promise
for
maturity
than
lucy
natty
completeness
it
was
like
the
contrast
between
a
rough
dark
overgrown
puppy
and
a
white
kitten
lucy
put
up
the
neatest
little
rosebud
mouth
to
be
kissed
everything
about
her
was
neat
her
little
round
neck
with
the
row
of
coral
beads
her
little
straight
nose
not
at
all
snubby
her
little
clear
eyebrows
rather
darker
than
her
curls
to
match
hazel
eyes
which
looked
up
with
shy
pleasure
at
maggie
taller
by
the
head
though
scarcely
a
year
older
maggie
always
looked
at
lucy
with
delight
she
was
fond
of
fancying
a
world
where
the
people
never
got
any
larger
than
children
of
their
own
age
and
she
made
the
queen
of
it
just
like
lucy
with
a
little
crown
on
her
head
and
a
little
sceptre
in
her
hand
only
the
queen
was
maggie
herself
in
lucy
form
oh
lucy
she
burst
out
after
kissing
her
you
stay
with
tom
and
me
wo
you
oh
kiss
her
tom
tom
too
had
come
up
to
lucy
but
he
was
not
going
to
kiss
her
no
he
came
up
to
her
with
maggie
because
it
seemed
easier
on
the
whole
than
saying
how
do
you
do
to
all
those
aunts
and
uncles
he
stood
looking
at
nothing
in
particular
with
the
blushing
awkward
air
and
which
are
common
to
shy
boys
when
in
company
very
much
as
if
they
had
come
into
the
world
by
mistake
and
found
it
in
a
degree
of
undress
that
was
quite
embarrassing
heyday
said
aunt
glegg
with
loud
emphasis
do
little
boys
and
gells
come
into
a
room
without
taking
notice
of
their
uncles
and
aunts
that
was
the
way
when
was
a
little
gell
go
and
speak
to
your
aunts
and
uncles
my
dears
said
tulliver
looking
anxious
and
melancholy
she
wanted
to
whisper
to
maggie
a
command
to
go
and
have
her
hair
brushed
well
and
how
do
you
do
and
i
hope
you
good
children
are
you
said
aunt
glegg
in
the
same
loud
emphatic
way
as
she
took
their
hands
hurting
them
with
her
large
rings
and
kissing
their
cheeks
much
against
their
desire
look
up
tom
look
up
boys
as
go
to
should
hold
their
heads
up
look
at
me
now
tom
declined
that
pleasure
apparently
for
he
tried
to
draw
his
hand
away
put
your
hair
behind
your
ears
maggie
and
keep
your
frock
on
your
shoulder
aunt
glegg
always
spoke
to
them
in
this
loud
emphatic
way
as
if
she
considered
them
deaf
or
perhaps
rather
idiotic
it
was
a
means
she
thought
of
making
them
feel
that
they
were
accountable
creatures
and
might
be
a
salutary
check
on
naughty
tendencies
bessy
children
were
so
spoiled
they
need
have
somebody
to
make
them
feel
their
duty
well
my
dears
said
aunt
pullet
in
a
compassionate
voice
you
grow
wonderful
fast
i
doubt
they
outgrow
their
strength
she
added
looking
over
their
heads
with
a
melancholy
expression
at
their
mother
i
think
the
gell
has
too
much
hair
i
have
it
thinned
and
cut
shorter
sister
if
i
was
you
it
is
good
for
her
health
it
that
as
makes
her
skin
so
brown
i
should
wonder
do
you
think
so
sister
deane
i
ca
say
i
sure
sister
said
deane
shutting
her
lips
close
again
and
looking
at
maggie
with
a
critical
eye
no
no
said
tulliver
the
child
healthy
enough
nothing
ails
her
there
red
wheat
as
well
as
white
for
that
matter
and
some
like
the
dark
grain
best
but
it
be
as
well
if
bessy
have
the
child
hair
cut
so
as
it
lie
smooth
a
dreadful
resolve
was
gathering
in
maggie
breast
but
it
was
arrested
by
the
desire
to
know
from
her
aunt
deane
whether
she
would
leave
lucy
behind
aunt
deane
would
hardly
ever
let
lucy
come
to
see
them
after
various
reasons
for
refusal
deane
appealed
to
lucy
herself
you
would
like
to
stay
behind
without
mother
should
you
lucy
yes
please
mother
said
lucy
timidly
blushing
very
pink
all
over
her
little
neck
well
done
lucy
let
her
stay
deane
let
her
stay
said
deane
a
large
but
man
with
a
type
of
to
be
seen
in
all
ranks
of
english
society
bald
crown
red
whiskers
full
forehead
and
general
solidity
without
heaviness
you
may
see
noblemen
like
deane
and
you
may
see
grocers
or
like
him
but
the
keenness
of
his
brown
eyes
was
less
common
than
his
contour
he
held
a
silver
very
tightly
in
his
hand
and
now
and
then
exchanged
a
pinch
with
tulliver
whose
box
was
only
so
that
it
was
naturally
a
joke
between
them
that
tulliver
wanted
to
exchange
also
deane
box
had
been
given
him
by
the
superior
partners
in
the
firm
to
which
he
belonged
at
the
same
time
that
they
gave
him
a
share
in
the
business
in
acknowledgment
of
his
valuable
services
as
manager
no
man
was
thought
more
highly
of
in
ogg
than
deane
and
some
persons
were
even
of
opinion
that
miss
susan
dodson
who
was
once
held
to
have
made
the
worst
match
of
all
the
dodson
sisters
might
one
day
ride
in
a
better
carriage
and
live
in
a
better
house
even
than
her
sister
pullet
there
was
no
knowing
where
a
man
would
stop
who
had
got
his
foot
into
a
great
shipowning
business
like
that
of
guest
with
a
banking
concern
attached
and
deane
as
her
intimate
female
friends
observed
was
proud
and
having
enough
let
her
husband
stand
still
in
the
world
for
want
of
spurring
maggie
said
tulliver
beckoning
maggie
to
her
and
whispering
in
her
ear
as
soon
as
this
point
of
lucy
staying
was
settled
go
and
get
your
hair
brushed
do
for
shame
i
told
you
not
to
come
in
without
going
to
martha
first
you
know
i
did
tom
come
out
with
me
whispered
maggie
pulling
his
sleeve
as
she
passed
him
and
tom
followed
willingly
enough
come
upstairs
with
me
tom
she
whispered
when
they
were
outside
the
door
there
something
i
want
to
do
before
dinner
there
no
time
to
play
at
anything
before
dinner
said
tom
whose
imagination
was
impatient
of
any
intermediate
prospect
oh
yes
there
is
time
for
this
come
tom
tom
followed
maggie
upstairs
into
her
mother
room
and
saw
her
go
at
once
to
a
drawer
from
which
she
took
out
a
large
pair
of
scissors
what
are
they
for
maggie
said
tom
feeling
his
curiosity
awakened
maggie
answered
by
seizing
her
front
locks
and
cutting
them
straight
across
the
middle
of
her
forehead
oh
my
buttons
maggie
you
catch
it
exclaimed
tom
better
not
cut
any
more
off
snip
went
the
great
scissors
again
while
tom
was
speaking
and
he
could
help
feeling
it
was
rather
good
fun
maggie
would
look
so
queer
here
tom
cut
it
behind
for
me
said
maggie
excited
by
her
own
daring
and
anxious
to
finish
the
deed
you
catch
it
you
know
said
tom
nodding
his
head
in
an
admonitory
manner
and
hesitating
a
little
as
he
took
the
scissors
never
mind
make
haste
said
maggie
giving
a
little
stamp
with
her
foot
her
cheeks
were
quite
flushed
the
black
locks
were
so
thick
nothing
could
be
more
tempting
to
a
lad
who
had
already
tasted
the
forbidden
pleasure
of
cutting
the
mane
i
speak
to
those
who
know
the
satisfaction
of
making
a
pair
of
scissors
meet
through
a
duly
resisting
mass
of
hair
one
delicious
grinding
snip
and
then
another
and
another
and
the
fell
heavily
on
the
floor
and
maggie
stood
cropped
in
a
jagged
uneven
manner
but
with
a
sense
of
clearness
and
freedom
as
if
she
had
emerged
from
a
wood
into
the
open
plain
oh
maggie
said
tom
jumping
round
her
and
slapping
his
knees
as
he
laughed
oh
my
buttons
what
a
queer
thing
you
look
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
you
look
like
the
idiot
we
throw
out
nutshells
to
at
school
maggie
felt
an
unexpected
pang
she
had
thought
beforehand
chiefly
at
her
own
deliverance
from
her
teasing
hair
and
teasing
remarks
about
it
and
something
also
of
the
triumph
she
should
have
over
her
mother
and
her
aunts
by
this
very
decided
course
of
action
she
did
want
her
hair
to
look
pretty
that
was
out
of
the
question
she
only
wanted
people
to
think
her
a
clever
little
girl
and
not
to
find
fault
with
her
but
now
when
tom
began
to
laugh
at
her
and
say
she
was
like
an
idiot
the
affair
had
quite
a
new
aspect
she
looked
in
the
glass
and
still
tom
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
and
cheeks
began
to
pale
and
her
lips
to
tremble
a
little
oh
maggie
you
have
to
go
down
to
dinner
directly
said
tom
oh
my
do
laugh
at
me
tom
said
maggie
in
a
passionate
tone
with
an
outburst
of
angry
tears
stamping
and
giving
him
a
push
now
then
spitfire
said
tom
what
did
you
cut
it
off
for
then
i
shall
go
down
i
can
smell
the
dinner
going
in
he
hurried
downstairs
and
left
poor
maggie
to
that
bitter
sense
of
the
irrevocable
which
was
almost
an
experience
of
her
small
soul
she
could
see
clearly
enough
now
the
thing
was
done
that
it
was
very
foolish
and
that
she
should
have
to
hear
and
think
more
about
her
hair
than
ever
for
maggie
rushed
to
her
deeds
with
passionate
impulse
and
then
saw
not
only
their
consequences
but
what
would
have
happened
if
they
had
not
been
done
with
all
the
detail
and
exaggerated
circumstance
of
an
active
imagination
tom
never
did
the
same
sort
of
foolish
things
as
maggie
having
a
wonderful
instinctive
discernment
of
what
would
turn
to
his
advantage
or
disadvantage
and
so
it
happened
that
though
he
was
much
more
wilful
and
inflexible
than
maggie
his
mother
hardly
ever
called
him
naughty
but
if
tom
did
make
a
mistake
of
that
sort
he
espoused
it
and
stood
by
it
he
did
mind
if
he
broke
the
lash
of
his
father
gigwhip
by
lashing
the
gate
he
could
help
it
the
whip
should
have
got
caught
in
the
hinge
if
tom
tulliver
whipped
a
gate
he
was
convinced
not
that
the
whipping
of
gates
by
all
boys
was
a
justifiable
act
but
that
he
tom
tulliver
was
justifiable
in
whipping
that
particular
gate
and
he
was
going
to
be
sorry
but
maggie
as
she
stood
crying
before
the
glass
felt
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
down
to
dinner
and
endure
the
severe
eyes
and
severe
words
of
her
aunts
while
tom
and
lucy
and
martha
who
waited
at
table
and
perhaps
her
father
and
her
uncles
would
laugh
at
her
for
if
tom
had
laughed
at
her
of
course
every
one
else
would
and
if
she
had
only
let
her
hair
alone
she
could
have
sat
with
tom
and
lucy
and
had
the
apricot
pudding
and
the
custard
what
could
she
do
but
sob
she
sat
as
helpless
and
despairing
among
her
black
locks
as
ajax
among
the
slaughtered
sheep
very
trivial
perhaps
this
anguish
seems
to
mortals
who
have
to
think
of
christmas
bills
dead
loves
and
broken
friendships
but
it
was
not
less
bitter
to
maggie
perhaps
it
was
even
more
bitter
than
what
we
are
fond
of
calling
antithetically
the
real
troubles
of
mature
life
ah
my
child
you
will
have
real
troubles
to
fret
about
by
and
by
is
the
consolation
we
have
almost
all
of
us
had
administered
to
us
in
our
childhood
and
have
repeated
to
other
children
since
we
have
been
grown
up
we
have
all
of
us
sobbed
so
piteously
standing
with
tiny
bare
legs
above
our
little
socks
when
we
lost
sight
of
our
mother
or
nurse
in
some
strange
place
but
we
can
no
longer
recall
the
poignancy
of
that
moment
and
weep
over
it
as
we
do
over
the
remembered
sufferings
of
five
or
ten
years
ago
every
one
of
those
keen
moments
has
left
its
trace
and
lives
in
us
still
but
such
traces
have
blent
themselves
irrecoverably
with
the
firmer
texture
of
our
youth
and
manhood
and
so
it
comes
that
we
can
look
on
at
the
troubles
of
our
children
with
a
smiling
disbelief
in
the
reality
of
their
pain
is
there
any
one
who
can
recover
the
experience
of
his
childhood
not
merely
with
a
memory
what
he
did
and
what
happened
to
him
of
what
he
liked
and
disliked
when
he
was
in
frock
and
trousers
but
with
an
intimate
penetration
a
revived
consciousness
of
what
he
felt
then
when
it
was
so
long
from
one
midsummer
to
another
what
he
felt
when
his
school
fellows
shut
him
out
of
their
game
because
he
would
pitch
the
ball
wrong
out
of
mere
wilfulness
or
on
a
rainy
day
in
the
holidays
when
he
did
know
how
to
amuse
himself
and
fell
from
idleness
into
mischief
from
mischief
into
defiance
and
from
defiance
into
sulkiness
or
when
his
mother
absolutely
refused
to
let
him
have
a
tailed
coat
that
half
although
every
other
boy
of
his
age
had
gone
into
tails
already
surely
if
we
could
recall
that
early
bitterness
and
the
dim
guesses
the
strangely
perspectiveless
conception
of
life
that
gave
the
bitterness
its
intensity
we
should
not
the
griefs
of
our
children
miss
maggie
you
to
come
down
this
minute
said
kezia
entering
the
room
hurriedly
lawks
what
have
you
been
i
never
such
a
fright
do
kezia
said
maggie
angrily
go
away
but
i
tell
you
you
to
come
down
miss
this
minute
your
mother
says
so
said
kezia
going
up
to
maggie
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
to
raise
her
from
the
floor
get
away
kezia
i
do
want
any
dinner
said
maggie
resisting
kezia
arm
i
come
oh
well
i
ca
stay
i
got
to
wait
at
dinner
said
kezia
going
out
again
maggie
you
little
silly
said
tom
peeping
into
the
room
ten
minutes
after
why
do
you
come
and
have
your
dinner
there
lots
o
goodies
and
mother
says
you
to
come
what
are
you
crying
for
you
little
spooney
oh
it
was
dreadful
tom
was
so
hard
and
unconcerned
if
had
been
crying
on
the
floor
maggie
would
have
cried
too
and
there
was
the
dinner
so
nice
and
she
was
hungry
it
was
very
bitter
but
tom
was
not
altogether
hard
he
was
not
inclined
to
cry
and
did
not
feel
that
maggie
grief
spoiled
his
prospect
of
the
sweets
but
he
went
and
put
his
head
near
her
and
said
in
a
lower
comforting
tone
wo
you
come
then
magsie
shall
i
bring
you
a
bit
o
pudding
when
i
had
mine
and
a
custard
and
things
said
maggie
beginning
to
feel
life
a
little
more
tolerable
very
well
said
tom
going
away
but
he
turned
again
at
the
door
and
said
but
you
better
come
you
know
there
the
dessert
nuts
you
know
and
cowslip
wine
maggie
tears
had
ceased
and
she
looked
reflective
as
tom
left
her
his
good
nature
had
taken
off
the
keenest
edge
of
her
suffering
and
nuts
with
cowslip
wine
began
to
assert
their
legitimate
influence
slowly
she
rose
from
amongst
her
scattered
locks
and
slowly
she
made
her
way
downstairs
then
she
stood
leaning
with
one
shoulder
against
the
frame
of
the
door
peeping
in
when
it
was
ajar
she
saw
tom
and
lucy
with
an
empty
chair
between
them
and
there
were
the
custards
on
a
it
was
too
much
she
slipped
in
and
went
toward
the
empty
chair
but
she
had
no
sooner
sat
down
than
she
repented
and
wished
herself
back
again
tulliver
gave
a
little
scream
as
she
saw
her
and
felt
such
a
turn
that
she
dropped
the
large
into
the
dish
with
the
most
serious
results
to
the
for
kezia
had
not
betrayed
the
reason
of
maggie
refusal
to
come
down
not
liking
to
give
her
mistress
a
shock
in
the
moment
of
carving
and
tulliver
thought
there
was
nothing
worse
in
question
than
a
fit
of
perverseness
which
was
inflicting
its
own
punishment
by
depriving
maggie
of
half
her
dinner
tulliver
scream
made
all
eyes
turn
towards
the
same
point
as
her
own
and
maggie
cheeks
and
ears
began
to
burn
while
uncle
glegg
a
old
gentleman
said
heyday
what
little
gell
this
why
i
do
know
her
is
it
some
little
gell
you
picked
up
in
the
road
kezia
why
she
gone
and
cut
her
hair
herself
said
tulliver
in
an
undertone
to
deane
laughing
with
much
enjoyment
did
you
ever
know
such
a
little
hussy
as
it
is
why
little
miss
you
made
yourself
look
very
funny
said
uncle
pullet
and
perhaps
he
never
in
his
life
made
an
observation
which
was
felt
to
be
so
lacerating
fie
for
shame
said
aunt
glegg
in
her
loudest
severest
tone
of
reproof
little
gells
as
cut
their
own
hair
should
be
whipped
and
fed
on
bread
and
water
not
come
and
sit
down
with
their
aunts
and
uncles
ay
ay
said
uncle
glegg
meaning
to
give
a
playful
turn
to
this
denunciation
she
must
be
sent
to
jail
i
think
and
they
cut
the
rest
of
her
hair
off
there
and
make
it
all
even
she
more
like
a
gypsy
nor
ever
said
aunt
pullet
in
a
pitying
tone
it
very
bad
luck
sister
as
the
gell
should
be
so
brown
the
boy
fair
enough
i
doubt
it
stand
in
her
way
i
life
to
be
so
brown
she
a
naughty
child
as
break
her
mother
heart
said
tulliver
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
maggie
seemed
to
be
listening
to
a
chorus
of
reproach
and
derision
her
first
flush
came
from
anger
which
gave
her
a
transient
power
of
defiance
and
tom
thought
she
was
braving
it
out
supported
by
the
recent
appearance
of
the
pudding
and
custard
under
this
impression
he
whispered
oh
my
maggie
i
told
you
you
catch
it
he
meant
to
be
friendly
but
maggie
felt
convinced
that
tom
was
rejoicing
in
her
ignominy
her
feeble
power
of
defiance
left
her
in
an
instant
her
heart
swelled
and
getting
up
from
her
chair
she
ran
to
her
father
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
burst
out
into
loud
sobbing
come
come
my
wench
said
her
father
soothingly
putting
his
arm
round
her
never
mind
you
was
i
the
right
to
cut
it
off
if
it
plagued
you
give
over
crying
father
take
your
part
delicious
words
of
tenderness
maggie
never
forgot
any
of
these
moments
when
her
father
took
her
part
she
kept
them
in
her
heart
and
thought
of
them
long
years
after
when
every
one
else
said
that
her
father
had
done
very
ill
by
his
children
how
your
husband
does
spoil
that
child
bessy
said
glegg
in
a
loud
aside
to
tulliver
it
be
the
ruin
of
her
if
you
do
take
care
father
never
brought
his
children
up
so
else
we
should
ha
been
a
different
sort
o
family
to
what
we
are
tulliver
domestic
sorrows
seemed
at
this
moment
to
have
reached
the
point
at
which
insensibility
begins
she
took
no
notice
of
her
sister
remark
but
threw
back
her
capstrings
and
dispensed
the
pudding
in
mute
resignation
with
the
dessert
there
came
entire
deliverance
for
maggie
for
the
children
were
told
they
might
have
their
nuts
and
wine
in
the
since
the
day
was
so
mild
and
they
scampered
out
among
the
budding
bushes
of
the
garden
with
the
alacrity
of
small
animals
getting
from
under
a
burning
glass
tulliver
had
her
special
reason
for
this
permission
now
the
dinner
was
despatched
and
every
one
mind
disengaged
it
was
the
right
moment
to
communicate
tulliver
intention
concerning
tom
and
it
would
be
as
well
for
tom
himself
to
be
absent
the
children
were
used
to
hear
themselves
talked
of
as
freely
as
if
they
were
birds
and
could
understand
nothing
however
they
might
stretch
their
necks
and
listen
but
on
this
occasion
tulliver
manifested
an
unusual
discretion
because
she
had
recently
had
evidence
that
the
going
to
school
to
a
clergyman
was
a
sore
point
with
tom
who
looked
at
it
as
very
much
on
a
par
with
going
to
school
to
a
constable
tulliver
had
a
sighing
sense
that
her
husband
would
do
as
he
liked
whatever
sister
glegg
said
or
sister
pullet
either
but
at
least
they
would
not
be
able
to
say
if
the
thing
turned
out
ill
that
bessy
had
fallen
in
with
her
husband
folly
without
letting
her
own
friends
know
a
word
about
it
tulliver
she
said
interrupting
her
husband
in
his
talk
with
deane
it
time
now
to
tell
the
children
aunts
and
uncles
what
you
thinking
of
doing
with
tom
is
it
very
well
said
tulliver
rather
sharply
i
no
objections
to
tell
anybody
what
i
mean
to
do
with
him
i
settled
he
added
looking
toward
glegg
and
deane
i
settled
to
send
him
to
a
stelling
a
parson
down
at
king
lorton
there
an
uncommon
clever
fellow
i
understand
as
put
him
up
to
most
things
there
was
a
rustling
demonstration
of
surprise
in
the
company
such
as
you
may
have
observed
in
a
country
congregation
when
they
hear
an
allusion
to
their
affairs
from
the
pulpit
it
was
equally
astonishing
to
the
aunts
and
uncles
to
find
a
parson
introduced
into
tulliver
family
arrangements
as
for
uncle
pullet
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
thoroughly
obfuscated
if
tulliver
had
said
that
he
was
going
to
send
tom
to
the
lord
chancellor
for
uncle
pullet
belonged
to
that
extinct
class
of
british
yeoman
who
dressed
in
good
broadcloth
paid
high
rates
and
taxes
went
to
church
and
ate
a
particularly
good
dinner
on
sunday
without
dreaming
that
the
british
constitution
in
church
and
state
had
a
traceable
origin
any
more
than
the
solar
system
and
the
fixed
stars
it
is
melancholy
but
true
that
pullet
had
the
most
confused
idea
of
a
bishop
as
a
sort
of
a
baronet
who
might
or
might
not
be
a
clergyman
and
as
the
rector
of
his
own
parish
was
a
man
of
high
family
and
fortune
the
idea
that
a
clergyman
could
be
a
schoolmaster
was
too
remote
from
pullet
experience
to
be
readily
conceivable
i
know
it
is
difficult
for
people
in
these
instructed
times
to
believe
in
uncle
pullet
ignorance
but
let
them
reflect
on
the
remarkable
results
of
a
great
natural
faculty
under
favoring
circumstances
and
uncle
pullet
had
a
great
natural
faculty
for
ignorance
he
was
the
first
to
give
utterance
to
his
astonishment
why
what
can
you
be
going
to
send
him
to
a
parson
for
he
said
with
an
amazed
twinkling
in
his
eyes
looking
at
glegg
and
deane
to
see
if
they
showed
any
signs
of
comprehension
why
because
the
parsons
are
the
best
schoolmasters
by
what
i
can
make
out
said
poor
tulliver
who
in
the
maze
of
this
puzzling
world
laid
hold
of
any
clue
with
great
readiness
and
tenacity
jacobs
at
th
academy
no
parson
and
he
done
very
bad
by
the
boy
and
i
made
up
my
mind
if
i
send
him
to
school
again
it
should
be
to
somebody
different
to
jacobs
and
this
stelling
by
what
i
can
make
out
is
the
sort
o
man
i
want
and
i
mean
my
boy
to
go
to
him
at
midsummer
he
concluded
in
a
tone
of
decision
tapping
his
and
taking
a
pinch
you
have
to
pay
a
swinging
bill
then
eh
tulliver
the
clergymen
have
highish
notions
in
general
said
deane
taking
snuff
vigorously
as
he
always
did
when
wishing
to
maintain
a
neutral
position
what
do
you
think
the
parson
teach
him
to
know
a
good
sample
wheat
when
he
sees
it
neighbor
tulliver
said
glegg
who
was
fond
of
his
jest
and
having
retired
from
business
felt
that
it
was
not
only
allowable
but
becoming
in
him
to
take
a
playful
view
of
things
why
you
see
i
got
a
plan
i
my
head
about
tom
said
tulliver
pausing
after
that
statement
and
lifting
up
his
glass
well
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
speak
and
it
seldom
as
i
am
said
glegg
with
a
tone
of
bitter
meaning
i
should
like
to
know
what
good
is
to
come
to
the
boy
by
bringin
him
up
above
his
fortin
why
said
tulliver
not
looking
at
glegg
but
at
the
male
part
of
his
audience
you
see
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
bring
tom
up
to
my
own
business
i
had
my
thoughts
about
it
all
along
and
i
made
up
my
mind
by
what
i
saw
with
garnett
and
son
i
mean
to
put
him
to
some
business
as
he
can
go
into
without
capital
and
i
want
to
give
him
an
eddication
as
he
be
even
wi
the
lawyers
and
folks
and
put
me
up
to
a
notion
now
an
then
glegg
emitted
a
long
sort
of
guttural
sound
with
closed
lips
that
smiled
in
mingled
pity
and
scorn
it
be
a
fine
deal
better
for
some
people
she
said
after
that
introductory
note
if
they
let
the
lawyers
alone
is
he
at
the
head
of
a
grammar
school
then
this
clergyman
such
as
that
at
market
bewley
said
deane
no
nothing
of
that
said
tulliver
he
wo
take
more
than
two
or
three
pupils
and
so
he
have
the
more
time
to
attend
to
you
know
ah
and
get
his
eddication
done
the
sooner
they
ca
learn
much
at
a
time
when
there
so
many
of
said
uncle
pullet
feeling
that
he
was
getting
quite
an
insight
into
this
difficult
matter
but
he
want
the
more
pay
i
doubt
said
glegg
ay
ay
a
cool
hundred
a
year
that
all
said
tulliver
with
some
pride
at
his
own
spirited
course
but
then
you
know
it
an
investment
tom
eddication
be
so
much
capital
to
him
ay
there
something
in
that
said
glegg
well
well
neighbor
tulliver
you
may
be
right
you
may
be
right
land
is
gone
and
money
spent
then
learning
is
most
excellent
i
remember
seeing
those
two
lines
wrote
on
a
window
at
buxton
but
us
that
have
got
no
learning
had
better
keep
our
money
eh
neighbor
pullet
glegg
rubbed
his
knees
and
looked
very
pleasant
glegg
i
wonder
you
said
his
wife
it
very
unbecoming
in
a
man
o
your
age
and
belongings
what
unbecoming
mrs
said
glegg
winking
pleasantly
at
the
company
my
new
blue
coat
as
i
got
on
i
pity
your
weakness
glegg
i
say
it
unbecoming
to
be
making
a
joke
when
you
see
your
own
kin
going
headlongs
to
ruin
if
you
mean
me
by
that
said
tulliver
considerably
nettled
you
need
trouble
yourself
to
fret
about
me
i
can
manage
my
own
affairs
without
troubling
other
folks
bless
me
said
deane
judiciously
introducing
a
new
idea
why
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
somebody
said
wakem
was
going
to
send
son
the
deformed
lad
to
a
clergyman
did
they
susan
appealing
to
his
wife
i
can
give
no
account
of
it
i
sure
said
deane
closing
her
lips
very
tightly
again
deane
was
not
a
woman
to
take
part
in
a
scene
where
missiles
were
flying
well
said
tulliver
speaking
all
the
more
cheerfully
that
glegg
might
see
he
did
mind
her
if
wakem
thinks
o
sending

who
felt
as
if
the
whole
business
had
a
funereal
aspect
it
more
to
send
to
a
clergyman
yes
said
glegg
interpreting
pullet
observation
with
erroneous
plausibility
you
must
consider
that
neighbor
tulliver
wakem
son
is
likely
to
follow
any
business
wakem
make
a
gentleman
of
him
poor
fellow
glegg
said
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
her
indignation
would
fizz
and
ooze
a
little
though
she
was
determined
to
keep
it
corked
up
you
far
better
hold
your
tongue
tulliver
does
want
to
know
your
opinion
nor
mine
either
there
folks
in
the
world
as
know
better
than
everybody
else
why
i
should
think
that
you
if
we
to
trust
your
own
tale
said
tulliver
beginning
to
boil
up
again
oh
say
nothing
said
glegg
sarcastically
my
advice
has
never
been
asked
and
i
do
give
it
it
be
the
first
time
then
said
tulliver
it
the
only
thing
you
at
giving
i
been
at
lending
then
if
i
have
been
at
giving
said
glegg
there
folks
i
lent
money
to
as
perhaps
i
shall
repent
o
lending
money
to
kin
come
come
come
said
glegg
soothingly
but
tulliver
was
not
to
be
hindered
of
his
retort
you
got
a
bond
for
it
i
reckon
he
said
and
you
had
your
five
per
cent
kin
or
no
kin
sister
said
tulliver
pleadingly
drink
your
wine
and
let
me
give
you
some
almonds
and
raisins
bessy
i
sorry
for
you
said
glegg
very
much
with
the
feeling
of
a
cur
that
seizes
the
opportunity
of
diverting
his
bark
toward
the
man
who
carries
no
stick
it
poor
work
talking
almonds
and
raisins
lors
sister
glegg
do
be
so
quarrelsome
said
pullet
beginning
to
cry
a
little
you
may
be
struck
with
a
fit
getting
so
red
in
the
face
after
dinner
and
we
are
but
just
out
o
mourning
all
of
us
and
all
wi
gowns
craped
alike
and
just
put
by
it
very
bad
among
sisters
i
should
think
it
bad
said
glegg
things
are
come
to
a
fine
pass
when
one
sister
invites
the
other
to
her
house
o
purpose
to
quarrel
with
her
and
abuse
her
softly
softly
jane
be
reasonable
be
reasonable
said
glegg
but
while
he
was
speaking
tulliver
who
had
by
no
means
said
enough
to
satisfy
his
anger
burst
out
again
who
wants
to
quarrel
with
you
he
said
it
you
as
ca
let
people
alone
but
must
be
gnawing
at
forever
should
never
want
to
quarrel
with
any
woman
if
she
kept
her
place
my
place
indeed
said
glegg
getting
rather
more
shrill
there
your
betters
tulliver
as
are
dead
and
in
their
grave
treated
me
with
a
different
sort
o
respect
to
what
you
do
i
got
a
husband
as
sit
by
and
see
me
abused
by
them
as
never
ha
had
the
chance
if
there
had
been
them
in
our
family
as
married
worse
than
they
might
ha
done
if
you
talk
o
that
said
tulliver
my
family
as
good
as
yours
and
better
for
it
has
got
a
damned
woman
in
it
well
said
glegg
rising
from
her
chair
i
do
know
whether
you
think
it
a
fine
thing
to
sit
by
and
hear
me
swore
at
glegg
but
i
not
going
to
stay
a
minute
longer
in
this
house
you
can
stay
behind
and
come
home
with
the
gig
and
i
walk
home
dear
heart
dear
heart
said
glegg
in
a
melancholy
tone
as
he
followed
his
wife
out
of
the
room
tulliver
how
could
you
talk
so
said
tulliver
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
let
her
go
said
tulliver
too
hot
to
be
damped
by
any
amount
of
tears
let
her
go
and
the
sooner
the
better
she
wo
be
trying
to
domineer
over
again
in
a
hurry
sister
pullet
said
tulliver
helplessly
do
you
think
it
be
any
use
for
you
to
go
after
her
and
try
to
pacify
her
better
not
better
not
said
deane
you
make
it
up
another
day
then
sisters
shall
we
go
and
look
at
the
children
said
tulliver
drying
her
eyes
no
proposition
could
have
been
more
seasonable
tulliver
felt
very
much
as
if
the
air
had
been
cleared
of
obtrusive
flies
now
the
women
were
out
of
the
room
there
were
few
things
he
liked
better
than
a
chat
with
deane
whose
close
application
to
business
allowed
the
pleasure
very
rarely
deane
he
considered
was
the
knowingest
man
of
his
acquaintance
and
he
had
besides
a
ready
causticity
of
tongue
that
made
an
agreeable
supplement
to
tulliver
own
tendency
that
way
which
had
remained
in
rather
an
inarticulate
condition
and
now
the
women
were
gone
they
could
carry
on
their
serious
talk
without
frivolous
interruption
they
could
exchange
their
views
concerning
the
duke
of
wellington
whose
conduct
in
the
catholic
question
had
thrown
such
an
entirely
new
light
on
his
character
and
speak
slightingly
of
his
conduct
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
which
he
would
never
have
won
if
there
had
been
a
great
many
englishmen
at
his
back
not
to
speak
of
blucher
and
the
prussians
who
as
tulliver
had
heard
from
a
person
of
particular
knowledge
in
that
matter
had
come
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
though
here
there
was
a
slight
dissidence
deane
remarking
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
give
much
credit
to
the
prussians
the
build
of
their
vessels
together
with
the
unsatisfactory
character
of
transactions
in
dantzic
beer
inclining
him
to
form
rather
a
low
view
of
prussian
pluck
generally
rather
beaten
on
this
ground
tulliver
proceeded
to
express
his
fears
that
the
country
could
never
again
be
what
it
used
to
be
but
deane
attached
to
a
firm
of
which
the
returns
were
on
the
increase
naturally
took
a
more
lively
view
of
the
present
and
had
some
details
to
give
concerning
the
state
of
the
imports
especially
in
hides
and
spelter
which
soothed
imagination
by
throwing
into
more
distant
perspective
the
period
when
the
country
would
become
utterly
the
prey
of
papists
and
radicals
and
there
would
be
no
more
chance
for
honest
men
uncle
pullet
sat
by
and
listened
with
twinkling
eyes
to
these
high
matters
he
did
understand
politics
himself
thought
they
were
a
natural
gift
but
by
what
he
could
make
out
this
duke
of
wellington
was
no
better
than
he
should
be
chapter
viii
tulliver
shows
his
weaker
side
suppose
sister
glegg
should
call
her
money
in
it
be
very
awkward
for
you
to
have
to
raise
five
hundred
pounds
now
said
tulliver
to
her
husband
that
evening
as
she
took
a
plaintive
review
of
the
day
tulliver
had
lived
thirteen
years
with
her
husband
yet
she
retained
in
all
the
freshness
of
her
early
married
life
a
facility
of
saying
things
which
drove
him
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
one
she
desired
some
minds
are
wonderful
for
keeping
their
bloom
in
this
way
as
a
patriarchal
goldfish
apparently
retains
to
the
last
its
youthful
illusion
that
it
can
swim
in
a
straight
line
beyond
the
encircling
glass
tulliver
was
an
amiable
fish
of
this
kind
and
after
running
her
head
against
the
same
resisting
medium
for
thirteen
years
would
go
at
it
again
with
undulled
alacrity
this
observation
of
hers
tended
directly
to
convince
tulliver
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
awkward
for
him
to
raise
five
hundred
pounds
and
when
tulliver
became
rather
pressing
to
know
he
would
raise
it
without
mortgaging
the
mill
and
the
house
which
he
had
said
he
never
mortgage
since
nowadays
people
were
none
so
ready
to
lend
money
without
security
tulliver
getting
warm
declared
that
glegg
might
do
as
she
liked
about
calling
in
her
money
he
should
pay
it
in
whether
or
not
he
was
not
going
to
be
beholden
to
his
wife
sisters
when
a
man
had
married
into
a
family
where
there
was
a
whole
litter
of
women
he
might
have
plenty
to
put
up
with
if
he
chose
but
tulliver
did
choose
tulliver
cried
a
little
in
a
trickling
quiet
way
as
she
put
on
her
nightcap
but
presently
sank
into
a
comfortable
sleep
lulled
by
the
thought
that
she
would
talk
everything
over
with
her
sister
pullet
when
she
was
to
take
the
children
to
garum
firs
to
tea
not
that
she
looked
forward
to
any
distinct
issue
from
that
talk
but
it
seemed
impossible
that
past
events
should
be
so
obstinate
as
to
remain
unmodified
when
they
were
complained
against
her
husband
lay
awake
rather
longer
for
he
too
was
thinking
of
a
visit
he
would
pay
on
the
morrow
and
his
ideas
on
the
subject
were
not
of
so
vague
and
soothing
a
kind
as
those
of
his
amiable
partner
tulliver
when
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
feeling
had
a
promptitude
in
action
that
may
seem
inconsistent
with
that
painful
sense
of
the
complicated
puzzling
nature
of
human
affairs
under
which
his
more
dispassionate
deliberations
were
conducted
but
it
is
really
not
improbable
that
there
was
a
direct
relation
between
these
apparently
contradictory
phenomena
since
i
have
observed
that
for
getting
a
strong
impression
that
a
skein
is
tangled
there
is
nothing
like
snatching
hastily
at
a
single
thread
it
was
owing
to
this
promptitude
that
tulliver
was
on
horseback
soon
after
dinner
the
next
day
he
was
not
dyspeptic
on
his
way
to
basset
to
see
his
sister
moss
and
her
husband
for
having
made
up
his
mind
irrevocably
that
he
would
pay
glegg
her
loan
of
five
hundred
pounds
it
naturally
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
a
promissory
note
for
three
hundred
pounds
lent
to
his
moss
and
if
the
said
could
manage
to
pay
in
the
money
within
a
given
time
it
would
go
far
to
lessen
the
fallacious
air
of
inconvenience
which
spirited
step
might
have
worn
in
the
eyes
of
weak
people
who
require
to
know
precisely
a
thing
is
to
be
done
before
they
are
strongly
confident
that
it
will
be
easy
for
tulliver
was
in
a
position
neither
new
nor
striking
but
like
other
things
sure
to
have
a
cumulative
effect
that
will
be
felt
in
the
long
run
he
was
held
to
be
a
much
more
substantial
man
than
he
really
was
and
as
we
are
all
apt
to
believe
what
the
world
believes
about
us
it
was
his
habit
to
think
of
failure
and
ruin
with
the
same
sort
of
remote
pity
with
which
a
spare
man
hears
that
his
plethoric
neighbor
is
stricken
with
apoplexy
he
had
been
always
used
to
hear
pleasant
jokes
about
his
advantages
as
a
man
who
worked
his
own
mill
and
owned
a
pretty
bit
of
land
and
these
jokes
naturally
kept
up
his
sense
that
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
substance
they
gave
a
pleasant
flavor
to
his
glass
on
a
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
recurrence
of
payments
tulliver
would
really
have
forgotten
that
there
was
a
mortgage
of
two
thousand
pounds
on
his
very
desirable
freehold
that
was
not
altogether
his
own
fault
since
one
of
the
thousand
pounds
was
his
sister
fortune
which
he
had
to
pay
on
her
marriage
and
a
man
who
has
neighbors
that
go
to
law
with
him
is
not
likely
to
pay
off
his
mortgages
especially
if
he
enjoys
the
good
opinion
of
acquaintances
who
want
to
borrow
a
hundred
pounds
on
security
too
lofty
to
be
represented
by
parchment
our
friend
tulliver
had
a
fibre
in
him
and
did
not
like
to
give
harsh
refusals
even
to
his
sister
who
had
not
only
come
in
to
the
world
in
that
superfluous
way
characteristic
of
sisters
creating
a
necessity
for
mortgages
but
had
quite
thrown
herself
away
in
marriage
and
had
crowned
her
mistakes
by
having
an
eighth
baby
on
this
point
tulliver
was
conscious
of
being
a
little
weak
but
he
apologized
to
himself
by
saying
that
poor
gritty
had
been
a
wench
before
she
married
moss
he
would
sometimes
say
this
even
with
a
slight
tremulousness
in
his
voice
but
this
morning
he
was
in
a
mood
more
becoming
a
man
of
business
and
in
the
course
of
his
ride
along
the
basset
lanes
with
their
deep
ruts
lying
so
far
away
from
a
that
the
labor
of
drawing
produce
and
manure
was
enough
to
take
away
the
best
part
of
the
profits
on
such
poor
land
as
that
parish
was
made
of
he
got
up
a
due
amount
of
irritation
against
moss
as
a
man
without
capital
who
if
murrain
and
blight
were
abroad
was
sure
to
have
his
share
of
them
and
who
the
more
you
tried
to
help
him
out
of
the
mud
would
sink
the
further
in
it
would
do
him
good
rather
than
harm
now
if
he
were
obliged
to
raise
this
three
hundred
pounds
it
would
make
him
look
about
him
better
and
not
act
so
foolishly
about
his
wool
this
year
as
he
did
the
last
in
fact
tulliver
had
been
too
easy
with
his
and
because
he
had
let
the
interest
run
on
for
two
years
moss
was
likely
enough
to
think
that
he
should
never
be
troubled
about
the
principal
but
tulliver
was
determined
not
to
encourage
such
shuffling
people
any
longer
and
a
ride
along
the
basset
lanes
was
not
likely
to
enervate
a
resolution
by
softening
his
temper
the
made
in
the
muddiest
days
of
winter
gave
him
a
shake
now
and
then
which
suggested
a
rash
but
stimulating
snarl
at
the
father
of
lawyers
who
whether
by
means
of
his
hoof
or
otherwise
had
doubtless
something
to
do
with
this
state
of
the
roads
and
the
abundance
of
foul
land
and
neglected
fences
that
met
his
eye
though
they
made
no
part
of
his
brother
moss
farm
strongly
contributed
to
his
dissatisfaction
with
that
unlucky
agriculturist
if
this
was
moss
fallow
it
might
have
been
basset
was
all
alike
it
was
a
beggarly
parish
in
tulliver
opinion
and
his
opinion
was
certainly
not
groundless
basset
had
a
poor
soil
poor
roads
a
poor
landlord
a
poor
vicar
and
rather
less
than
half
a
curate
also
poor
if
any
one
strongly
impressed
with
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
triumph
over
circumstances
will
contend
that
the
parishioners
of
basset
might
nevertheless
have
been
a
very
superior
class
of
people
i
have
nothing
to
urge
against
that
abstract
proposition
i
only
know
that
in
point
of
fact
the
basset
mind
was
in
strict
keeping
with
its
circumstances
the
muddy
lanes
green
or
clayey
that
seemed
to
the
unaccustomed
eye
to
lead
nowhere
but
into
each
other
did
really
lead
with
patience
to
a
distant
but
there
were
many
feet
in
basset
which
they
led
more
frequently
to
a
centre
of
dissipation
spoken
of
formerly
as
the
markis
o
granby
but
among
intimates
as
dickison
a
large
low
room
with
a
sanded
floor
a
cold
scent
of
tobacco
modified
by
undetected
dickison
leaning
against
the
with
a
melancholy
pimpled
face
looking
as
irrelevant
to
the
daylight
as
a
last
night
guttered
candle
all
this
may
not
seem
a
very
seductive
form
of
temptation
but
the
majority
of
men
in
basset
found
it
fatally
alluring
when
encountered
on
their
road
toward
four
on
a
wintry
afternoon
and
if
any
wife
in
basset
wished
to
indicate
that
her
husband
was
not
a
man
she
could
hardly
do
it
more
emphatically
than
by
saying
that
he
did
spend
a
shilling
at
dickison
from
one
whitsuntide
to
another
moss
had
said
so
of
husband
more
than
once
when
her
brother
was
in
a
mood
to
find
fault
with
him
as
he
certainly
was
and
nothing
could
be
less
pacifying
to
tulliver
than
the
behavior
of
the
farmyard
gate
which
he
no
sooner
attempted
to
push
open
with
his
than
it
acted
as
gates
without
the
upper
hinge
are
known
to
do
to
the
peril
of
shins
whether
equine
or
human
he
was
about
to
get
down
and
lead
his
horse
through
the
damp
dirt
of
the
hollow
farmyard
shadowed
drearily
by
the
large
buildings
up
to
the
long
line
of
standing
on
a
raised
causeway
but
the
timely
appearance
of
a
cowboy
saved
him
that
frustration
of
a
plan
he
had
determined
on
namely
not
to
get
down
from
his
horse
during
this
visit
if
a
man
means
to
be
hard
let
him
keep
in
his
saddle
and
speak
from
that
height
above
the
level
of
pleading
eyes
and
with
the
command
of
a
distant
horizon
moss
heard
the
sound
of
the
feet
and
when
her
brother
rode
up
was
already
outside
the
kitchen
door
with
a
smile
on
her
face
and
a
baby
in
her
arms
moss
face
bore
a
faded
resemblance
to
her
brother
baby
little
fat
hand
pressed
against
her
cheek
seemed
to
show
more
strikingly
that
the
cheek
was
faded
brother
i
glad
to
see
you
she
said
in
an
affectionate
tone
i
did
look
for
you
how
do
you
do
oh
pretty
well
moss
pretty
well
answered
the
brother
with
cool
deliberation
as
if
it
were
rather
too
forward
of
her
to
ask
that
question
she
knew
at
once
that
her
brother
was
not
in
a
good
humor
he
never
called
her
moss
except
when
he
was
angry
and
when
they
were
in
company
but
she
thought
it
was
in
the
order
of
nature
that
people
who
were
poorly
off
should
be
snubbed
moss
did
not
take
her
stand
on
the
equality
of
the
human
race
she
was
a
patient
prolific
woman
your
husband
is
in
the
house
i
suppose
added
tulliver
after
a
grave
pause
during
which
four
children
had
run
out
like
chickens
whose
mother
has
been
suddenly
in
eclipse
behind
the
no
said
moss
but
he
only
in
the
yonders
georgy
run
to
the
far
close
in
a
minute
and
tell
father
your
come
you
get
down
brother
wo
you
and
take
something
no
no
i
ca
get
down
i
must
be
going
home
again
directly
said
tulliver
looking
at
the
distance
and
how
tulliver
and
the
children
said
moss
humbly
not
daring
to
press
her
invitation
oh
pretty
well
tom
going
to
a
new
school
at
midsummer
a
deal
of
expense
to
me
it
bad
work
for
me
lying
out
o
my
money
i
wish
you
be
so
good
as
let
the
children
come
and
see
their
cousins
some
day
my
little
uns
want
to
see
their
cousin
maggie
so
as
never
was
and
me
her
godmother
and
so
fond
of
her
there
nobody
make
a
bigger
fuss
with
her
according
to
what
they
got
and
i
know
she
likes
to
come
for
she
a
loving
child
and
how
quick
and
clever
she
is
to
be
sure
if
moss
had
been
one
of
the
most
astute
women
in
the
world
instead
of
being
one
of
the
simplest
she
could
have
thought
of
nothing
more
likely
to
propitiate
her
brother
than
this
praise
of
maggie
he
seldom
found
any
one
volunteering
praise
of
the
little
wench
it
was
usually
left
entirely
to
himself
to
insist
on
her
merits
but
maggie
always
appeared
in
the
most
amiable
light
at
her
aunt
moss
it
was
her
alsatia
where
she
was
out
of
the
reach
of
law
if
she
upset
anything
dirtied
her
shoes
or
tore
her
frock
these
things
were
matters
of
course
at
her
aunt
moss
in
spite
of
himself
tulliver
eyes
got
milder
and
he
did
not
look
away
from
his
sister
as
he
said
ay
she
fonder
o
you
than
o
the
other
aunts
i
think
she
takes
after
our
family
not
a
bit
of
her
mother
in
her
moss
says
she
just
like
what
i
used
to
be
said
moss
though
i
was
never
so
quick
and
fond
o
the
books
but
i
think
my
like
her
sharp
come
here
lizzy
my
dear
and
let
your
uncle
see
you
he
hardly
knows
you
you
grow
so
fast
lizzy
a
child
of
seven
looked
very
shy
when
her
mother
drew
her
forward
for
the
small
mosses
were
much
in
awe
of
their
uncle
from
dorlcote
mill
she
was
inferior
enough
to
maggie
in
fire
and
strength
of
expression
to
make
the
resemblance
between
the
two
entirely
flattering
to
tulliver
fatherly
love
ay
they
a
bit
alike
he
said
looking
kindly
at
the
little
figure
in
the
soiled
pinafore
they
both
take
after
our
mother
you
got
enough
o
gells
gritty
he
added
in
a
tone
half
compassionate
half
reproachful
four
of
bless
said
moss
with
a
sigh
stroking
lizzy
hair
on
each
side
of
her
forehead
as
many
as
there
boys
they
got
a
brother
apiece
ah
but
they
must
turn
out
and
fend
for
themselves
said
tulliver
feeling
that
his
severity
was
relaxing
and
trying
to
brace
it
by
throwing
out
a
wholesome
hint
they
must
look
to
hanging
on
their
brothers
no
but
i
hope
their
brothers
love
the
poor
things
and
remember
they
came
o
one
father
and
mother
the
lads
never
be
the
poorer
for
that
said
moss
flashing
out
with
hurried
timidity
like
a
fire
tulliver
gave
his
horse
a
little
stroke
on
the
flank
then
checked
it
and
said
angrily
stand
still
with
you
much
to
the
astonishment
of
that
innocent
animal
and
the
more
there
is
of
the
more
they
must
love
one
another
moss
went
on
looking
at
her
children
with
a
didactic
purpose
but
she
turned
toward
her
brother
again
to
say
not
but
what
i
hope
your
boy
allays
be
good
to
his
sister
though
there
but
two
of
like
you
and
me
brother
the
arrow
went
straight
to
tulliver
heart
he
had
not
a
rapid
imagination
but
the
thought
of
maggie
was
very
near
to
him
and
he
was
not
long
in
seeing
his
relation
to
his
own
sister
side
by
side
with
tom
relation
to
maggie
would
the
little
wench
ever
be
poorly
off
and
tom
rather
hard
upon
her
ay
ay
gritty
said
the
miller
with
a
new
softness
in
his
tone
but
i
allays
done
what
i
could
for
you
he
added
as
if
vindicating
himself
from
a
reproach
i
not
denying
that
brother
and
i
noways
ungrateful
said
poor
moss
too
fagged
by
toil
and
children
to
have
strength
left
for
any
pride
but
here
the
father
what
a
while
you
been
moss
while
do
you
call
it
said
moss
feeling
out
of
breath
and
injured
i
been
running
all
the
way
wo
you
mr
tulliver
well
i
just
get
down
and
have
a
bit
o
talk
with
you
in
the
garden
said
tulliver
thinking
that
he
should
be
more
likely
to
show
a
due
spirit
of
resolve
if
his
sister
were
not
present
he
got
down
and
passed
with
moss
into
the
garden
toward
an
old
arbor
while
his
sister
stood
tapping
her
baby
on
the
back
and
looking
wistfully
after
them
their
entrance
into
the
arbor
surprised
several
fowls
that
were
recreating
themselves
by
scratching
deep
holes
in
the
dusty
ground
and
at
once
took
flight
with
much
pother
and
cackling
tulliver
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
tapping
the
ground
curiously
here
and
there
with
his
stick
as
if
he
suspected
some
hollowness
opened
the
conversation
by
observing
with
something
like
a
snarl
in
his
tone
why
you
got
wheat
again
in
that
corner
close
i
see
and
never
a
bit
o
dressing
on
it
you
do
no
good
with
it
this
year
moss
who
when
he
married
miss
tulliver
had
been
regarded
as
the
buck
of
basset
now
wore
a
beard
nearly
a
week
old
and
had
the
depressed
unexpectant
air
of
a
he
answered
in
a
tone
why
poor
farmers
like
me
must
do
as
they
can
they
must
leave
it
to
them
as
have
got
money
to
play
with
to
put
half
as
much
into
the
ground
as
they
mean
to
get
out
of
it
i
do
know
who
should
have
money
to
play
with
if
it
is
them
as
can
borrow
money
without
paying
interest
said
tulliver
who
wished
to
get
into
a
slight
quarrel
it
was
the
most
natural
and
easy
introduction
to
calling
in
money
i
know
i
behind
with
the
interest
said
moss
but
i
was
so
unlucky
wi
the
wool
last
year
and
what
with
the
missis
being
laid
up
so
things
have
gone
nor
usual
ay
snarled
tulliver
there
folks
as
things
allays
go
with
empty
sacks
never
stand
upright
well
i
do
know
what
fault
you
got
to
find
wi
me
tulliver
said
moss
deprecatingly
i
know
there
is
a
works
harder
what
the
use
o
that
said
tulliver
sharply
when
a
man
marries
and
got
no
capital
to
work
his
farm
but
his
wife
bit
fortin
i
was
against
it
from
the
first
but
you
neither
of
you
listen
to
me
and
i
ca
lie
out
o
my
money
any
longer
for
i
got
to
pay
five
hundred
o
glegg
and
there
be
tom
an
expense
to
me
i
should
find
myself
short
even
saying
i
got
back
all
as
is
my
own
you
must
look
about
and
see
how
you
can
pay
me
the
three
hundred
pound
well
if
that
what
you
mean
said
moss
looking
blankly
before
him
we
better
be
sold
up
and
ha
done
with
it
i
must
part
every
head
o
stock
i
got
to
pay
you
and
the
landlord
too
poor
relations
are
undeniably
irritating
their
existence
is
so
entirely
uncalled
for
on
our
part
and
they
are
almost
always
very
faulty
people
tulliver
had
succeeded
in
getting
quite
as
much
irritated
with
moss
as
he
had
desired
and
he
was
able
to
say
angrily
rising
from
his
seat
well
you
must
do
as
you
can
ca
find
money
for
everybody
else
as
well
as
myself
i
must
look
to
my
own
business
and
my
own
family
i
ca
lie
out
o
my
money
any
longer
you
must
raise
it
as
quick
as
you
can
tulliver
walked
abruptly
out
of
the
arbor
as
he
uttered
the
last
sentence
and
without
looking
round
at
moss
went
on
to
the
kitchen
door
where
the
eldest
boy
was
holding
his
horse
and
his
sister
was
waiting
in
a
state
of
wondering
alarm
which
was
not
without
its
alleviations
for
baby
was
making
pleasant
gurgling
sounds
and
performing
a
great
deal
of
finger
practice
on
the
faded
face
moss
had
eight
children
but
could
never
overcome
her
regret
that
the
twins
had
not
lived
moss
thought
their
removal
was
not
without
its
consolations
wo
you
come
in
brother
she
said
looking
anxiously
at
her
husband
who
was
walking
slowly
up
while
tulliver
had
his
foot
already
in
the
stirrup
no
no
said
he
turning
his
horse
head
and
riding
away
no
man
could
feel
more
resolute
till
he
got
outside
the
yard
gate
and
a
little
way
along
the
lane
but
before
he
reached
the
next
turning
which
would
take
him
out
of
sight
of
the
dilapidated
he
appeared
to
be
smitten
by
some
sudden
thought
he
checked
his
horse
and
made
it
stand
still
in
the
same
spot
for
two
or
three
minutes
during
which
he
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
a
melancholy
way
as
if
he
were
looking
at
some
painful
object
on
more
sides
than
one
evidently
after
his
fit
of
promptitude
tulliver
was
relapsing
into
the
sense
that
this
is
a
puzzling
world
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
back
giving
vent
to
the
climax
of
feeling
which
had
determined
this
movement
by
saying
aloud
as
he
struck
his
horse
poor
little
wench
she
have
nobody
but
tom
belike
when
i
gone
tulliver
return
into
the
yard
was
descried
by
several
young
mosses
who
immediately
ran
in
with
the
exciting
news
to
their
mother
so
that
moss
was
again
on
the
when
her
brother
rode
up
she
had
been
crying
but
was
rocking
baby
to
sleep
in
her
arms
now
and
made
no
ostentatious
show
of
sorrow
as
her
brother
looked
at
her
but
merely
said
the
father
gone
to
the
field
again
if
you
want
him
brother
no
gritty
no
said
tulliver
in
a
gentle
tone
do
you
fret
that
all
i
make
a
shift
without
the
money
a
bit
only
you
must
be
as
clever
and
contriving
as
you
can
moss
tears
came
again
at
this
unexpected
kindness
and
she
could
say
nothing
come
come
the
little
wench
shall
come
and
see
you
i
bring
her
and
tom
some
day
before
he
goes
to
school
you
must
fret
allays
be
a
good
brother
to
you
thank
you
for
that
word
brother
said
moss
drying
her
tears
then
turning
to
lizzy
she
said
run
now
and
fetch
the
colored
egg
for
cousin
maggie
lizzy
ran
in
and
quickly
reappeared
with
a
small
paper
parcel
it
boiled
hard
brother
and
colored
with
thrums
very
pretty
it
was
done
o
purpose
for
maggie
will
you
please
to
carry
it
in
your
pocket
ay
ay
said
tulliver
putting
it
carefully
in
his
side
pocket
and
so
the
respectable
miller
returned
along
the
basset
lanes
rather
more
puzzled
than
before
as
to
ways
and
means
but
still
with
the
sense
of
a
danger
escaped
it
had
come
across
his
mind
that
if
he
were
hard
upon
his
sister
it
might
somehow
tend
to
make
tom
hard
upon
maggie
at
some
distant
day
when
her
father
was
no
longer
there
to
take
her
part
for
simple
people
like
our
friend
tulliver
are
apt
to
clothe
unimpeachable
feelings
in
erroneous
ideas
and
this
was
his
confused
way
of
explaining
to
himself
that
his
love
and
anxiety
for
the
little
wench
had
given
him
a
new
sensibility
toward
his
sister
chapter
ix
to
garum
firs
while
the
possible
troubles
of
maggie
future
were
occupying
her
father
mind
she
herself
was
tasting
only
the
bitterness
of
the
present
childhood
has
no
forebodings
but
then
it
is
soothed
by
no
memories
of
outlived
sorrow
the
fact
was
the
day
had
begun
ill
with
maggie
the
pleasure
of
having
lucy
to
look
at
and
the
prospect
of
the
afternoon
visit
to
garum
firs
where
she
would
hear
uncle
pullet
musical
box
had
been
marred
as
early
as
eleven
by
the
advent
of
the
from
ogg
who
had
spoken
in
the
severest
terms
of
the
condition
in
which
he
had
found
her
hair
holding
up
one
jagged
lock
after
another
and
saying
see
here
tut
tut
tut
in
a
tone
of
mingled
disgust
and
pity
which
to
maggie
imagination
was
equivalent
to
the
strongest
expression
of
public
opinion
rappit
the
with
his
coronal
locks
tending
wavily
upward
like
the
simulated
pyramid
of
flame
on
a
monumental
urn
seemed
to
her
at
that
moment
the
most
formidable
of
her
contemporaries
into
whose
street
at
ogg
she
would
carefully
refrain
from
entering
through
the
rest
of
her
life
moreover
the
preparation
for
a
visit
being
always
a
serious
affair
in
the
dodson
family
martha
was
enjoined
to
have
tulliver
room
ready
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
that
the
laying
out
of
the
best
clothes
might
not
be
deferred
till
the
last
moment
as
was
sometimes
the
case
in
families
of
lax
views
where
the
were
never
rolled
up
where
there
was
little
or
no
wrapping
in
silver
paper
and
where
the
sense
that
the
sunday
clothes
could
be
got
at
quite
easily
produced
no
shock
to
the
mind
already
at
twelve
tulliver
had
on
her
visiting
costume
with
a
protective
apparatus
of
brown
holland
as
if
she
had
been
a
piece
of
satin
furniture
in
danger
of
flies
maggie
was
frowning
and
twisting
her
shoulders
that
she
might
if
possible
shrink
away
from
the
prickliest
of
tuckers
while
her
mother
was
remonstrating
do
maggie
my
dear
do
make
yourself
so
ugly
and
tom
cheeks
were
looking
particularly
brilliant
as
a
relief
to
his
best
blue
suit
which
he
wore
with
becoming
calmness
having
after
a
little
wrangling
effected
what
was
always
the
one
point
of
interest
to
him
in
his
toilet
he
had
transferred
all
the
contents
of
his
pockets
to
those
actually
in
wear
as
for
lucy
she
was
just
as
pretty
and
neat
as
she
had
been
yesterday
no
accidents
ever
happened
to
her
clothes
and
she
was
never
uncomfortable
in
them
so
that
she
looked
with
wondering
pity
at
maggie
pouting
and
writhing
under
the
exasperating
tucker
maggie
would
certainly
have
torn
it
off
if
she
had
not
been
checked
by
the
remembrance
of
her
recent
humiliation
about
her
hair
as
it
was
she
confined
herself
to
fretting
and
twisting
and
behaving
peevishly
about
the
which
they
were
allowed
to
build
till
dinner
as
a
suitable
amusement
for
boys
and
girls
in
their
best
clothes
tom
could
build
perfect
pyramids
of
houses
but
maggie
would
never
bear
the
laying
on
the
roof
it
was
always
so
with
the
things
that
maggie
made
and
tom
had
deduced
the
conclusion
that
no
girls
could
ever
make
anything
but
it
happened
that
lucy
proved
wonderfully
clever
at
building
she
handled
the
cards
so
lightly
and
moved
so
gently
that
tom
condescended
to
admire
her
houses
as
well
as
his
own
the
more
readily
because
she
had
asked
him
to
teach
her
maggie
too
would
have
admired
lucy
houses
and
would
have
given
up
her
own
unsuccessful
building
to
contemplate
them
without
ill
temper
if
her
tucker
had
not
made
her
peevish
and
if
tom
had
not
inconsiderately
laughed
when
her
houses
fell
and
told
her
she
was
a
stupid
do
laugh
at
me
tom
she
burst
out
angrily
i
not
a
stupid
i
know
a
great
many
things
you
do
oh
i
dare
say
miss
spitfire
i
never
be
such
a
cross
thing
as
you
making
faces
like
that
lucy
does
do
so
i
like
lucy
better
than
you
wish
lucy
was
sister
then
it
very
wicked
and
cruel
of
you
to
wish
so
said
maggie
starting
up
hurriedly
from
her
place
on
the
floor
and
upsetting
wonderful
pagoda
she
really
did
not
mean
it
but
the
circumstantial
evidence
was
against
her
and
tom
turned
white
with
anger
but
said
nothing
he
would
have
struck
her
only
he
knew
it
was
cowardly
to
strike
a
girl
and
tom
tulliver
was
quite
determined
he
would
never
do
anything
cowardly
maggie
stood
in
dismay
and
terror
while
tom
got
up
from
the
floor
and
walked
away
pale
from
the
scattered
ruins
of
his
pagoda
and
lucy
looked
on
mutely
like
a
kitten
pausing
from
its
lapping
oh
tom
said
maggie
at
last
going
toward
him
i
mean
to
knock
it
down
indeed
indeed
i
did
tom
took
no
notice
of
her
but
took
instead
two
or
three
hard
peas
out
of
his
pocket
and
shot
them
with
his
thumbnail
against
the
window
vaguely
at
first
but
presently
with
the
distinct
aim
of
hitting
a
superannuated
which
was
exposing
its
imbecility
in
the
spring
sunshine
clearly
against
the
views
of
nature
who
had
provided
tom
and
the
peas
for
the
speedy
destruction
of
this
weak
individual
thus
the
morning
had
been
made
heavy
to
maggie
and
tom
persistent
coldness
to
her
all
through
their
walk
spoiled
the
fresh
air
and
sunshine
for
her
he
called
lucy
to
look
at
the
bird
nest
without
caring
to
show
it
maggie
and
peeled
a
willow
switch
for
lucy
and
himself
without
offering
one
to
maggie
lucy
had
said
maggie
should
like
one
but
tom
was
deaf
still
the
sight
of
the
peacock
opportunely
spreading
his
tail
on
the
stackyard
wall
just
as
they
reached
garum
firs
was
enough
to
divert
the
mind
temporarily
from
personal
grievances
and
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
beautiful
sights
at
garum
firs
all
the
farmyard
life
was
wonderful
there
bantams
speckled
and
friesland
hens
with
their
feathers
all
turned
the
wrong
way
that
flew
and
screamed
and
dropped
their
pretty
spotted
feathers
and
a
tame
magpie
nay
a
goat
and
a
wonderful
brindled
dog
half
mastiff
half
as
large
as
a
lion
then
there
were
white
railings
and
white
gates
all
about
and
glittering
weathercocks
of
various
design
and
paved
with
pebbles
in
beautiful
patterns
nothing
was
quite
common
at
garum
firs
and
tom
thought
that
the
unusual
size
of
the
toads
there
was
simply
due
to
the
general
unusualness
which
characterized
uncle
pullet
possessions
as
a
gentleman
farmer
toads
who
paid
rent
were
naturally
leaner
as
for
the
house
it
was
not
less
remarkable
it
had
a
receding
centre
and
two
wings
with
battlemented
turrets
and
was
covered
with
glittering
white
stucco
uncle
pullet
had
seen
the
expected
party
approaching
from
the
window
and
made
haste
to
unbar
and
unchain
the
front
door
kept
always
in
this
fortified
condition
from
fear
of
tramps
who
might
be
supposed
to
know
of
the
glass
case
of
stuffed
birds
in
the
hall
and
to
contemplate
rushing
in
and
carrying
it
away
on
their
heads
aunt
pullet
too
appeared
at
the
doorway
and
as
soon
as
her
sister
was
within
hearing
said
stop
the
children
for
god
sake
bessy
let
come
up
the
sally
bringing
the
old
mat
and
the
duster
to
rub
their
shoes
pullet
mats
were
by
no
means
intended
to
wipe
shoes
on
the
very
scraper
had
a
deputy
to
do
its
dirty
work
tom
rebelled
particularly
against
this
shoewiping
which
he
always
considered
in
the
light
of
an
indignity
to
his
sex
he
felt
it
as
the
beginning
of
the
disagreeables
incident
to
a
visit
at
aunt
pullet
where
he
had
once
been
compelled
to
sit
with
towels
wrapped
round
his
boots
a
fact
which
may
serve
to
correct
the
conclusion
that
a
visit
to
garum
firs
must
have
been
a
great
treat
to
a
young
gentleman
fond
of
animals
fond
that
is
of
throwing
stones
at
them
the
next
disagreeable
was
confined
to
his
feminine
companions
it
was
the
mounting
of
the
polished
oak
stairs
which
had
very
handsome
carpets
rolled
up
and
laid
by
in
a
spare
bedroom
so
that
the
ascent
of
these
glossy
steps
might
have
served
in
barbarous
times
as
a
trial
by
ordeal
from
which
none
but
the
most
spotless
virtue
could
have
come
off
with
unbroken
limbs
sophy
weakness
about
these
polished
stairs
was
always
a
subject
of
bitter
remonstrance
on
glegg
part
but
tulliver
ventured
on
no
comment
only
thinking
to
herself
it
was
a
mercy
when
she
and
the
children
were
safe
on
the
landing
gray
has
sent
home
my
new
bonnet
bessy
said
pullet
in
a
pathetic
tone
as
tulliver
adjusted
her
cap
has
she
sister
said
tulliver
with
an
air
of
much
interest
and
how
do
you
like
it
it
apt
to
make
a
mess
with
clothes
taking
out
and
putting
in
again
said
pullet
drawing
a
bunch
of
keys
from
her
pocket
and
looking
at
them
earnestly
but
it
be
a
pity
for
you
to
go
away
without
seeing
it
there
no
knowing
what
may
happen
pullet
shook
her
head
slowly
at
this
last
serious
consideration
which
determined
her
to
single
out
a
particular
key
i
afraid
it
be
troublesome
to
you
getting
it
out
sister
said
tulliver
but
i
like
to
see
what
sort
of
a
crown
made
you
pullet
rose
with
a
melancholy
air
and
unlocked
one
wing
of
a
very
bright
wardrobe
where
you
may
have
hastily
supposed
she
would
find
a
new
bonnet
not
at
all
such
a
supposition
could
only
have
arisen
from
a
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
the
dodson
family
in
this
wardrobe
pullet
was
seeking
something
small
enough
to
be
hidden
among
layers
of
linen
it
was
a
you
must
come
with
me
into
the
best
room
said
pullet
may
the
children
come
too
sister
inquired
tulliver
who
saw
that
maggie
and
lucy
were
looking
rather
eager
well
said
aunt
pullet
reflectively
it
perhaps
be
safer
for
to
come
they
be
touching
something
if
we
leave
behind
so
they
went
in
procession
along
the
bright
and
slippery
corridor
dimly
lighted
by
the
top
of
the
window
which
rose
above
the
closed
shutter
it
was
really
quite
solemn
aunt
pullet
paused
and
unlocked
a
door
which
opened
on
something
still
more
solemn
than
the
passage
a
darkened
room
in
which
the
outer
light
entering
feebly
showed
what
looked
like
the
corpses
of
furniture
in
white
shrouds
everything
that
was
not
shrouded
stood
with
its
legs
upward
lucy
laid
hold
of
maggie
frock
and
maggie
heart
beat
rapidly
aunt
pullet
the
shutter
and
then
unlocked
the
wardrobe
with
a
melancholy
deliberateness
which
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
funereal
solemnity
of
the
scene
the
delicious
scent
of
that
issued
from
the
wardrobe
made
the
process
of
taking
out
sheet
after
sheet
of
silver
paper
quite
pleasant
to
assist
at
though
the
sight
of
the
bonnet
at
last
was
an
anticlimax
to
maggie
who
would
have
preferred
something
more
strikingly
preternatural
but
few
things
could
have
been
more
impressive
to
tulliver
she
looked
all
round
it
in
silence
for
some
moments
and
then
said
emphatically
well
sister
i
never
speak
against
the
full
crowns
again
it
was
a
great
concession
and
pullet
felt
it
she
felt
something
was
due
to
it
you
like
to
see
it
on
sister
she
said
sadly
i
open
the
shutter
a
bit
further
well
if
you
do
mind
taking
off
your
cap
sister
said
tulliver
pullet
took
off
her
cap
displaying
the
brown
silk
scalp
with
a
jutting
promontory
of
curls
which
was
common
to
the
more
mature
and
judicious
women
of
those
times
and
placing
the
bonnet
on
her
head
turned
slowly
round
like
a
draper
that
tulliver
might
miss
no
point
of
view
i
sometimes
thought
there
a
loop
too
much
o
ribbon
on
this
left
side
sister
what
do
you
think
said
pullet
tulliver
looked
earnestly
at
the
point
indicated
and
turned
her
head
on
one
side
well
i
think
it
best
as
it
is
if
you
meddled
with
it
sister
you
might
repent
that
true
said
aunt
pullet
taking
off
the
bonnet
and
looking
at
it
contemplatively
how
much
might
she
charge
you
for
that
bonnet
sister
said
tulliver
whose
mind
was
actively
engaged
on
the
possibility
of
getting
a
humble
imitation
of
this
made
from
a
piece
of
silk
she
had
at
home
pullet
screwed
up
her
mouth
and
shook
her
head
and
then
whispered
pullet
pays
for
it
he
said
i
was
to
have
the
best
bonnet
at
garum
church
let
the
next
best
be
whose
it
would
she
began
slowly
to
adjust
the
trimmings
in
preparation
for
returning
it
to
its
place
in
the
wardrobe
and
her
thoughts
seemed
to
have
taken
a
melancholy
turn
for
she
shook
her
head
ah
she
said
at
last
i
may
never
wear
it
twice
sister
who
knows
do
talk
o
that
sister
answered
tulliver
i
hope
have
your
health
this
summer
ah
but
there
may
come
a
death
in
the
family
as
there
did
soon
after
i
had
my
green
satin
bonnet
cousin
abbott
may
go
and
we
ca
think
o
wearing
crape
less
nor
half
a
year
for
him
that
be
unlucky
said
tulliver
entering
thoroughly
into
the
possibility
of
an
inopportune
decease
there
never
so
much
pleasure
i
wearing
a
bonnet
the
second
year
especially
when
the
crowns
are
so
chancy
never
two
summers
alike
ah
it
the
way
i
this
world
said
pullet
returning
the
bonnet
to
the
wardrobe
and
locking
it
up
she
maintained
a
silence
characterized
by
until
they
had
all
issued
from
the
solemn
chamber
and
were
in
her
own
room
again
then
beginning
to
cry
she
said
sister
if
you
should
never
see
that
bonnet
again
till
dead
and
gone
you
remember
i
showed
it
you
this
day
tulliver
felt
that
she
ought
to
be
affected
but
she
was
a
woman
of
sparse
tears
stout
and
healthy
she
could
cry
so
much
as
her
sister
pullet
did
and
had
often
felt
her
deficiency
at
funerals
her
effort
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes
issued
in
an
odd
contraction
of
her
face
maggie
looking
on
attentively
felt
that
there
was
some
painful
mystery
about
her
aunt
bonnet
which
she
was
considered
too
young
to
understand
indignantly
conscious
all
the
while
that
she
could
have
understood
that
as
well
as
everything
else
if
she
had
been
taken
into
confidence
when
they
went
down
uncle
pullet
observed
with
some
acumen
that
he
reckoned
the
missis
had
been
showing
her
bonnet
that
was
what
had
made
them
so
long
upstairs
with
tom
the
interval
had
seemed
still
longer
for
he
had
been
seated
in
irksome
constraint
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
directly
opposite
his
uncle
pullet
who
regarded
him
with
twinkling
gray
eyes
and
occasionally
addressed
him
as
young
sir
well
young
sir
what
do
you
learn
at
school
was
a
standing
question
with
uncle
pullet
whereupon
tom
always
looked
sheepish
rubbed
his
hands
across
his
face
and
answered
i
do
know
it
was
altogether
so
embarrassing
to
be
seated
with
uncle
pullet
that
tom
could
not
even
look
at
the
prints
on
the
walls
or
the
flycages
or
the
wonderful
he
saw
nothing
but
his
uncle
gaiters
not
that
tom
was
in
awe
of
his
uncle
mental
superiority
indeed
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
did
want
to
be
a
gentleman
farmer
because
he
should
like
to
be
such
a
silly
fellow
as
his
uncle
pullet
a
in
fact
a
boy
sheepishness
is
by
no
means
a
sign
of
overmastering
reverence
and
while
you
are
making
encouraging
advances
to
him
under
the
idea
that
he
is
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
your
age
and
wisdom
ten
to
one
he
is
thinking
you
extremely
queer
the
only
consolation
i
can
suggest
to
you
is
that
the
greek
boys
probably
thought
the
same
of
aristotle
it
is
only
when
you
have
mastered
a
restive
horse
or
thrashed
a
drayman
or
have
got
a
gun
in
your
hand
that
these
shy
juniors
feel
you
to
be
a
truly
admirable
and
enviable
character
at
least
i
am
quite
sure
of
tom
tulliver
sentiments
on
these
points
in
very
tender
years
when
he
still
wore
a
lace
border
under
his
outdoor
cap
he
was
often
observed
peeping
through
the
bars
of
a
gate
and
making
minatory
gestures
with
his
small
forefinger
while
he
scolded
the
sheep
with
an
inarticulate
burr
intended
to
strike
terror
into
their
astonished
minds
indicating
thus
early
that
desire
for
mastery
over
the
inferior
animals
wild
and
domestic
including
cockchafers
neighbors
dogs
and
small
sisters
which
in
all
ages
has
been
an
attribute
of
so
much
promise
for
the
fortunes
of
our
race
now
pullet
never
rode
anything
taller
than
a
low
pony
and
was
the
least
predatory
of
men
considering
firearms
dangerous
as
apt
to
go
off
of
themselves
by
nobody
particular
desire
so
that
tom
was
not
without
strong
reasons
when
in
confidential
talk
with
a
chum
he
had
described
uncle
pullet
as
a
nincompoop
taking
care
at
the
same
time
to
observe
that
he
was
a
very
rich
fellow
the
only
alleviating
circumstance
in
a
with
uncle
pullet
was
that
he
kept
a
variety
of
lozenges
and
about
his
person
and
when
at
a
loss
for
conversation
he
filled
up
the
void
by
proposing
a
mutual
solace
of
this
kind
do
you
like
peppermints
young
sir
required
only
a
tacit
answer
when
it
was
accompanied
by
a
presentation
of
the
article
in
question
the
appearance
of
the
little
girls
suggested
to
uncle
pullet
the
further
solace
of
small
of
which
he
also
kept
a
stock
under
lock
and
key
for
his
own
private
eating
on
wet
days
but
the
three
children
had
no
sooner
got
the
tempting
delicacy
between
their
fingers
than
aunt
pullet
desired
them
to
abstain
from
eating
it
till
the
tray
and
the
plates
came
since
with
those
crisp
cakes
they
would
make
the
floor
all
over
crumbs
lucy
did
mind
that
much
for
the
cake
was
so
pretty
she
thought
it
was
rather
a
pity
to
eat
it
but
tom
watching
his
opportunity
while
the
elders
were
talking
hastily
stowed
it
in
his
mouth
at
two
bites
and
chewed
it
furtively
as
for
maggie
becoming
fascinated
as
usual
by
a
print
of
ulysses
and
nausicaa
which
uncle
pullet
had
bought
as
a
pretty
scripture
thing
she
presently
let
fall
her
cake
and
in
an
unlucky
movement
crushed
it
beneath
her
foot
a
source
of
so
much
agitation
to
aunt
pullet
and
conscious
disgrace
to
maggie
that
she
began
to
despair
of
hearing
the
musical
till
after
some
reflection
it
occurred
to
her
that
lucy
was
in
high
favor
enough
to
venture
on
asking
for
a
tune
so
she
whispered
to
lucy
and
lucy
who
always
did
what
she
was
desired
to
do
went
up
quietly
to
her
uncle
knee
and
over
her
neck
while
she
fingered
her
necklace
said
will
you
please
play
us
a
tune
uncle
lucy
thought
it
was
by
reason
of
some
exceptional
talent
in
uncle
pullet
that
the
played
such
beautiful
tunes
and
indeed
the
thing
was
viewed
in
that
light
by
the
majority
of
his
neighbors
in
garum
pullet
had
the
box
to
begin
with
and
he
understood
winding
it
up
and
knew
which
tune
it
was
going
to
play
beforehand
altogether
the
possession
of
this
unique
piece
of
music
was
a
proof
that
pullet
character
was
not
of
that
entire
nullity
which
might
otherwise
have
been
attributed
to
it
but
uncle
pullet
when
entreated
to
exhibit
his
accomplishment
never
depreciated
it
by
a
consent
we
see
about
it
was
the
answer
he
always
gave
carefully
abstaining
from
any
sign
of
compliance
till
a
suitable
number
of
minutes
had
passed
uncle
pullet
had
a
programme
for
all
great
social
occasions
and
in
this
way
fenced
himself
in
from
much
painful
confusion
and
perplexing
freedom
of
will
perhaps
the
suspense
did
heighten
maggie
enjoyment
when
the
fairy
tune
began
for
the
first
time
she
quite
forgot
that
she
had
a
load
on
her
mind
that
tom
was
angry
with
her
and
by
the
time
hush
ye
pretty
warbling
choir
had
been
played
her
face
wore
that
bright
look
of
happiness
while
she
sat
immovable
with
her
hands
clasped
which
sometimes
comforted
her
mother
with
the
sense
that
maggie
could
look
pretty
now
and
then
in
spite
of
her
brown
skin
but
when
the
magic
music
ceased
she
jumped
up
and
running
toward
tom
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
said
oh
tom
is
it
pretty
lest
you
should
think
it
showed
a
revolting
insensibility
in
tom
that
he
felt
any
new
anger
toward
maggie
for
this
and
to
him
inexplicable
caress
i
must
tell
you
that
he
had
his
glass
of
cowslip
wine
in
his
hand
and
that
she
jerked
him
so
as
to
make
him
spill
half
of
it
he
must
have
been
an
extreme
milksop
not
to
say
angrily
look
there
now
especially
when
his
resentment
was
sanctioned
as
it
was
by
general
disapprobation
of
maggie
behavior
why
do
you
sit
still
maggie
her
mother
said
peevishly
little
gells
must
come
to
see
me
if
they
behave
in
that
way
said
aunt
pullet
why
you
too
rough
little
miss
said
uncle
pullet
poor
maggie
sat
down
again
with
the
music
all
chased
out
of
her
soul
and
the
seven
small
demons
all
in
again
tulliver
foreseeing
nothing
but
misbehavior
while
the
children
remained
indoors
took
an
early
opportunity
of
suggesting
that
now
they
were
rested
after
their
walk
they
might
go
and
play
out
of
doors
and
aunt
pullet
gave
permission
only
enjoining
them
not
to
go
off
the
paved
walks
in
the
garden
and
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
poultry
fed
to
view
them
from
a
distance
on
the
a
restriction
which
had
been
imposed
ever
since
tom
had
been
found
guilty
of
running
after
the
peacock
with
an
illusory
idea
that
fright
would
make
one
of
its
feathers
drop
off
tulliver
thoughts
had
been
temporarily
diverted
from
the
quarrel
with
glegg
by
millinery
and
maternal
cares
but
now
the
great
theme
of
the
bonnet
was
thrown
into
perspective
and
the
children
were
out
of
the
way
yesterday
anxieties
recurred
it
weighs
on
my
mind
so
as
never
was
she
said
by
way
of
opening
the
subject
sister
glegg
leaving
the
house
in
that
way
i
sure
i
no
wish
t
offend
a
sister
ah
said
aunt
pullet
there
no
accounting
for
what
jane
do
i
would
speak
of
it
out
o
the
family
if
it
was
to
turnbull
but
it
my
belief
jane
lives
too
low
i
said
so
to
pullet
often
and
often
and
he
knows
it
why
you
said
so
last
monday
was
a
week
when
we
came
away
from
drinking
tea
with
said
pullet
beginning
to
nurse
his
knee
and
shelter
it
with
his
as
was
his
way
when
the
conversation
took
an
interesting
turn
very
like
i
did
said
pullet
for
you
remember
when
i
said
things
better
than
i
can
remember
myself
he
got
a
wonderful
memory
pullet
has
she
continued
looking
pathetically
at
her
sister
i
should
be
poorly
off
if
he
was
to
have
a
stroke
for
he
always
remembers
when
i
got
to
take
my
doctor
stuff
and
taking
three
sorts
now
there
the
as
before
every
other
night
and
the
new
drops
at
eleven
and
four
and
the
mixture
agreeable
rehearsed
pullet
with
a
punctuation
determined
by
a
lozenge
on
his
tongue
ah
perhaps
it
be
better
for
sister
glegg
if
go
to
the
doctor
sometimes
instead
o
chewing
turkey
rhubarb
whenever
anything
the
matter
with
her
said
tulliver
who
naturally
saw
the
wide
subject
of
medicine
chiefly
in
relation
to
glegg
it
dreadful
to
think
on
said
aunt
pullet
raising
her
hands
and
letting
them
fall
again
people
playing
with
their
own
insides
in
that
way
and
it
flying
i
the
face
o
providence
for
what
are
the
doctors
for
if
we
are
to
call
in
and
when
folks
have
got
the
money
to
pay
for
a
doctor
it
is
respectable
as
i
told
jane
many
a
time
i
ashamed
of
acquaintance
knowing
it
well
no
call
to
be
ashamed
said
pullet
for
doctor
turnbull
has
got
such
another
patient
as
you
i
this
parish
now
old
sutton
gone
pullet
keeps
all
my
did
you
know
bessy
said
pullet
he
wo
have
one
sold
he
says
it
nothing
but
right
folks
should
see
when
i
gone
they
fill
two
o
the
long
shelves
but
she
added
beginning
to
cry
a
little
well
if
they
ever
fill
three
i
may
go
before
i
made
up
the
dozen
o
these
last
sizes
the
are
in
the
closet
in
my
room
you
remember
that
sister
but
there
nothing
to
show
for
the
boluses
if
it
is
the
bills
do
talk
o
your
going
sister
said
tulliver
i
should
have
nobody
to
stand
between
me
and
sister
glegg
if
you
was
gone
and
there
nobody
but
you
can
get
her
to
make
it
up
with
tulliver
for
sister
deane
never
o
my
side
and
if
she
was
it
not
to
be
looked
for
as
she
can
speak
like
them
as
have
got
an
independent
fortin
well
your
husband
you
know
bessy
said
pullet
ready
to
use
her
deep
depression
on
her
account
as
well
as
her
own
he
never
behaved
quite
so
pretty
to
our
family
as
he
should
do
and
the
children
take
after
him
the
very
mischievous
and
runs
away
from
his
aunts
and
uncles
and
the
gell
rude
and
brown
it
your
bad
luck
and
i
sorry
for
you
bessy
for
you
was
allays
my
favorite
sister
and
we
allays
liked
the
same
patterns
i
know
tulliver
hasty
and
says
odd
things
said
tulliver
wiping
away
one
small
tear
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
but
i
sure
he
never
been
the
man
since
he
married
me
to
object
to
my
making
the
friends
o
my
side
o
the
family
welcome
to
the
house
do
want
to
make
the
worst
of
you
bessy
said
pullet
compassionately
for
i
doubt
you
have
trouble
enough
without
that
and
your
husband
got
that
poor
sister
and
her
children
hanging
on
him
and
so
given
to
lawing
they
say
i
doubt
he
leave
you
poorly
off
when
he
dies
not
as
i
have
it
said
out
o
the
family
this
view
of
her
position
was
naturally
far
from
cheering
to
tulliver
her
imagination
was
not
easily
acted
on
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
her
case
was
a
hard
one
since
it
appeared
that
other
people
thought
it
hard
i
sure
sister
i
ca
help
myself
she
said
urged
by
the
fear
lest
her
anticipated
misfortunes
might
be
held
retributive
to
take
comprehensive
review
of
her
past
conduct
there
no
woman
strives
more
for
her
children
and
i
sure
at
this
as
i
had
all
the
bedhangings
taken
down
i
did
as
much
as
the
two
gells
put
together
and
there
the
last
wine
made
beautiful
i
allays
offer
it
along
with
the
sherry
though
sister
glegg
will
have
it
i
so
extravagant
and
as
for
liking
to
have
my
clothes
tidy
and
not
go
a
fright
about
the
house
nobody
in
the
parish
can
say
anything
against
me
in
respect
backbiting
and
making
mischief
for
i
do
wish
anybody
any
harm
and
nobody
loses
by
sending
me
a
porkpie
for
my
pies
are
fit
to
show
with
the
best
o
my
neighbors
and
the
linen
so
in
order
as
if
i
was
to
die
i
should
be
ashamed
a
woman
can
do
no
more
nor
she
can
but
it
all
o
no
use
you
know
bessy
said
pullet
holding
her
head
on
one
side
and
fixing
her
eyes
pathetically
on
her
sister
if
your
husband
makes
away
with
his
money
not
but
what
if
you
was
sold
up
and
other
folks
bought
your
furniture
it
a
comfort
to
think
as
you
kept
it
well
rubbed
and
there
the
linen
with
your
maiden
mark
on
might
go
all
over
the
country
it
be
a
sad
pity
for
our
family
pullet
shook
her
head
slowly
but
what
can
i
do
sister
said
tulliver
tulliver
not
a
man
to
be
dictated
to
not
if
i
was
to
go
to
the
parson
and
get
by
heart
what
i
should
tell
my
husband
for
the
best
and
i
sure
i
pretend
to
know
anything
about
putting
out
money
and
all
that
i
could
never
see
into
men
business
as
sister
glegg
does
well
you
like
me
in
that
bessy
said
pullet
and
i
think
it
be
a
deal
more
becoming
o
jane
if
she
have
that
rubbed
oftener
there
was
ever
so
many
spots
on
it
last
week
instead
o
dictating
to
folks
as
have
more
comings
in
than
she
ever
had
and
telling
what
they
to
do
with
their
money
but
jane
and
me
were
allays
contrairy
she
have
striped
things
and
i
like
spots
you
like
a
spot
too
bessy
we
allays
hung
together
i
that
yes
sophy
said
tulliver
i
remember
our
having
a
blue
ground
with
a
white
spot
both
alike
i
got
a
bit
in
a
now
and
if
you
would
but
go
and
see
sister
glegg
and
persuade
her
to
make
it
up
with
tulliver
i
should
take
it
very
kind
of
you
you
was
allays
a
good
sister
to
me
but
the
right
thing
be
for
tulliver
to
go
and
make
it
up
with
her
himself
and
say
he
was
sorry
for
speaking
so
rash
if
he
borrowed
money
of
her
he
should
be
above
that
said
pullet
whose
partiality
did
not
blind
her
to
principles
she
did
not
forget
what
was
due
to
people
of
independent
fortune
it
no
use
talking
o
that
said
poor
tulliver
almost
peevishly
if
i
was
to
go
down
on
my
bare
knees
on
the
gravel
to
tulliver
he
never
humble
himself
well
you
ca
expect
me
to
persuade
to
beg
pardon
said
pullet
her
temper
beyond
everything
it
well
if
it
carry
her
off
her
mind
though
there
never
any
of
our
family
went
to
a
madhouse
i
not
thinking
of
her
begging
pardon
said
tulliver
but
if
she
just
take
no
notice
and
not
call
her
money
in
as
it
not
so
much
for
one
sister
to
ask
of
another
time
mend
things
and
tulliver
forget
all
about
it
and
they
be
friends
again
tulliver
you
perceive
was
not
aware
of
her
irrevocable
determination
to
pay
in
the
five
hundred
pounds
at
least
such
a
determination
exceeded
her
powers
of
belief
well
bessy
said
pullet
mournfully
do
want
to
help
you
on
to
ruin
i
wo
be
behindhand
i
doing
you
a
good
turn
if
it
is
to
be
done
and
i
do
like
it
said
among
acquaintance
as
got
quarrels
in
the
family
i
shall
tell
jane
that
and
i
do
mind
driving
to
jane
tomorrow
if
pullet
does
mind
what
do
you
say
mr
pullet
i
no
objections
said
pullet
who
was
perfectly
contented
with
any
course
the
quarrel
might
take
so
that
tulliver
did
not
apply
to
for
money
pullet
was
nervous
about
his
investments
and
did
not
see
how
a
man
could
have
any
security
for
his
money
unless
he
turned
it
into
land
after
a
little
further
discussion
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
better
for
tulliver
to
accompany
them
on
a
visit
to
sister
glegg
pullet
observing
that
it
was
turned
to
reach
from
a
drawer
a
delicate
damask
napkin
which
she
pinned
before
her
in
the
fashion
of
an
apron
the
door
did
in
fact
soon
open
but
instead
of
the
sally
introduced
an
object
so
startling
that
both
pullet
and
tulliver
gave
a
scream
causing
uncle
pullet
to
swallow
his
lozenge
for
the
fifth
time
in
his
life
as
he
afterward
noted
chapter
x
maggie
behaves
worse
than
she
expected
the
startling
object
which
thus
made
an
epoch
for
uncle
pullet
was
no
other
than
little
lucy
with
one
side
of
her
person
from
her
small
foot
to
her
wet
and
discolored
with
mud
holding
out
two
tiny
blackened
hands
and
making
a
very
piteous
face
to
account
for
this
unprecedented
apparition
in
aunt
pullet
parlor
we
must
return
to
the
moment
when
the
three
children
went
to
play
out
of
doors
and
the
small
demons
who
had
taken
possession
of
maggie
soul
at
an
early
period
of
the
day
had
returned
in
all
the
greater
force
after
a
temporary
absence
all
the
disagreeable
recollections
of
the
morning
were
thick
upon
her
when
tom
whose
displeasure
toward
her
had
been
considerably
refreshed
by
her
foolish
trick
of
causing
him
to
upset
his
cowslip
wine
said
here
lucy
you
come
along
with
me
and
walked
off
to
the
area
where
the
toads
were
as
if
there
were
no
maggie
in
existence
seeing
this
maggie
lingered
at
a
distance
looking
like
a
small
medusa
with
her
snakes
cropped
lucy
was
naturally
pleased
that
cousin
tom
was
so
good
to
her
and
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
him
tickling
a
fat
toad
with
a
piece
of
string
when
the
toad
was
safe
down
the
area
with
an
iron
grating
over
him
still
lucy
wished
maggie
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
also
especially
as
she
would
doubtless
find
a
name
for
the
toad
and
say
what
had
been
his
past
history
for
lucy
had
a
delighted
semibelief
in
maggie
stories
about
the
live
things
they
came
upon
by
accident
how
earwig
had
a
wash
at
home
and
one
of
her
children
had
fallen
into
the
hot
copper
for
which
reason
she
was
running
so
fast
to
fetch
the
doctor
tom
had
a
profound
contempt
for
this
nonsense
of
maggie
smashing
the
earwig
at
once
as
a
superfluous
yet
easy
means
of
proving
the
entire
unreality
of
such
a
story
but
lucy
for
the
life
of
her
could
not
help
fancying
there
was
something
in
it
and
at
all
events
thought
it
was
very
pretty
so
now
the
desire
to
know
the
history
of
a
very
portly
toad
added
to
her
habitual
affectionateness
made
her
run
back
to
maggie
and
say
oh
there
is
such
a
big
funny
toad
maggie
do
come
and
see
maggie
said
nothing
but
turned
away
from
her
with
a
deeper
frown
as
long
as
tom
seemed
to
prefer
lucy
to
her
lucy
made
part
of
his
unkindness
maggie
would
have
thought
a
little
while
ago
that
she
could
never
be
cross
with
pretty
little
lucy
any
more
than
she
could
be
cruel
to
a
little
white
mouse
but
then
tom
had
always
been
quite
indifferent
to
lucy
before
and
it
had
been
left
to
maggie
to
pet
and
make
much
of
her
as
it
was
she
was
actually
beginning
to
think
that
she
should
like
to
make
lucy
cry
by
slapping
or
pinching
her
especially
as
it
might
vex
tom
whom
it
was
of
no
use
to
slap
even
if
she
dared
because
he
did
mind
it
and
if
lucy
had
been
there
maggie
was
sure
he
would
have
got
friends
with
her
sooner
tickling
a
fat
toad
who
is
not
highly
sensitive
is
an
amusement
that
it
is
possible
to
exhaust
and
tom
by
and
by
began
to
look
round
for
some
other
mode
of
passing
the
time
but
in
so
prim
a
garden
where
they
were
not
to
go
off
the
paved
walks
there
was
not
a
great
choice
of
sport
the
only
great
pleasure
such
a
restriction
suggested
was
the
pleasure
of
breaking
it
and
tom
began
to
meditate
an
insurrectionary
visit
to
the
pond
about
a
field
length
beyond
the
garden
i
say
lucy
he
began
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
with
great
significance
as
he
coiled
up
his
string
again
what
do
you
think
i
mean
to
do
what
tom
said
lucy
with
curiosity
i
mean
to
go
to
the
pond
and
look
at
the
pike
you
may
go
with
me
if
you
like
said
the
young
sultan
oh
tom
you
said
lucy
aunt
said
we
must
go
out
of
the
garden
oh
i
shall
go
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
said
tom
nobody
see
us
besides
i
do
care
if
they
do
i
run
off
home
but
could
run
said
lucy
who
had
never
before
been
exposed
to
such
severe
temptation
oh
never
mind
they
wo
be
cross
with
said
tom
you
say
i
took
you
tom
walked
along
and
lucy
trotted
by
his
side
timidly
enjoying
the
rare
treat
of
doing
something
naughty
excited
also
by
the
mention
of
that
celebrity
the
pike
about
which
she
was
quite
uncertain
whether
it
was
a
fish
or
a
fowl
maggie
saw
them
leaving
the
garden
and
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
follow
anger
and
jealousy
can
no
more
bear
to
lose
sight
of
their
objects
than
love
and
that
tom
and
lucy
should
do
or
see
anything
of
which
she
was
ignorant
would
have
been
an
intolerable
idea
to
maggie
so
she
kept
a
few
yards
behind
them
unobserved
by
tom
who
was
presently
absorbed
in
watching
for
the
pike
a
highly
interesting
monster
he
was
said
to
be
so
very
old
so
very
large
and
to
have
such
a
remarkable
appetite
the
pike
like
other
celebrities
did
not
show
when
he
was
watched
for
but
tom
caught
sight
of
something
in
rapid
movement
in
the
water
which
attracted
him
to
another
spot
on
the
brink
of
the
pond
here
lucy
he
said
in
a
loud
whisper
come
here
take
care
keep
on
the
grass
do
step
where
the
cows
have
been
he
added
pointing
to
a
peninsula
of
dry
grass
with
trodden
mud
on
each
side
of
it
for
tom
contemptuous
conception
of
a
girl
included
the
attribute
of
being
unfit
to
walk
in
dirty
places
lucy
came
carefully
as
she
was
bidden
and
bent
down
to
look
at
what
seemed
a
golden
darting
through
the
water
it
was
a
tom
told
her
and
lucy
at
last
could
see
the
serpentine
wave
of
its
body
very
much
wondering
that
a
snake
could
swim
maggie
had
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
she
see
it
too
though
it
was
bitter
to
her
like
everything
else
since
tom
did
not
care
about
her
seeing
it
at
last
she
was
close
by
lucy
and
tom
who
had
been
aware
of
her
approach
but
would
not
notice
it
till
he
was
obliged
turned
round
and
said
now
get
away
maggie
there
no
room
for
you
on
the
grass
here
nobody
asked
to
come
there
were
passions
at
war
in
maggie
at
that
moment
to
have
made
a
tragedy
if
tragedies
were
made
by
passion
only
but
the
essential
greek
text
which
was
present
in
the
passion
was
wanting
to
the
action
the
utmost
maggie
could
do
with
a
fierce
thrust
of
her
small
brown
arm
was
to
push
poor
little
lucy
into
the
mud
then
tom
could
not
restrain
himself
and
gave
maggie
two
smart
slaps
on
the
arm
as
he
ran
to
pick
up
lucy
who
lay
crying
helplessly
maggie
retreated
to
the
roots
of
a
tree
a
few
yards
off
and
looked
on
impenitently
usually
her
repentance
came
quickly
after
one
rash
deed
but
now
tom
and
lucy
had
made
her
so
miserable
she
was
glad
to
spoil
their
happiness
glad
to
make
everybody
uncomfortable
why
should
she
be
sorry
tom
was
very
slow
to
forgive
however
sorry
she
might
have
been
i
shall
tell
mother
you
know
miss
mag
said
tom
loudly
and
emphatically
as
soon
as
lucy
was
up
and
ready
to
walk
away
it
was
not
tom
practice
to
tell
but
here
justice
clearly
demanded
that
maggie
should
be
visited
with
the
utmost
punishment
not
that
tom
had
learned
to
put
his
views
in
that
abstract
form
he
never
mentioned
justice
and
had
no
idea
that
his
desire
to
punish
might
be
called
by
that
fine
name
lucy
was
too
entirely
absorbed
by
the
evil
that
had
befallen
her
the
spoiling
of
her
pretty
best
clothes
and
the
discomfort
of
being
wet
and
dirty
to
think
much
of
the
cause
which
was
entirely
mysterious
to
her
she
could
never
have
guessed
what
she
had
done
to
make
maggie
angry
with
her
but
she
felt
that
maggie
was
very
unkind
and
disagreeable
and
made
no
magnanimous
entreaties
to
tom
that
he
would
not
tell
only
running
along
by
his
side
and
crying
piteously
while
maggie
sat
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
looked
after
them
with
her
small
medusa
face
sally
said
tom
when
they
reached
the
kitchen
door
and
sally
looked
at
them
in
speechless
amaze
with
a
piece
of
in
her
mouth
and
a
in
her
hand
sally
tell
mother
it
was
maggie
pushed
lucy
into
the
mud
but
lors
ha
massy
how
did
you
get
near
such
mud
as
that
said
sally
making
a
wry
face
as
she
stooped
down
and
examined
the
tom
imagination
had
not
been
rapid
and
capacious
enough
to
include
this
question
among
the
foreseen
consequences
but
it
was
no
sooner
put
than
he
foresaw
whither
it
tended
and
that
maggie
would
not
be
considered
the
only
culprit
in
the
case
he
walked
quietly
away
from
the
kitchen
door
leaving
sally
to
that
pleasure
of
guessing
which
active
minds
notoriously
prefer
to
knowledge
sally
as
you
are
aware
lost
no
time
in
presenting
lucy
at
the
parlor
door
for
to
have
so
dirty
an
object
introduced
into
the
house
at
garum
firs
was
too
great
a
weight
to
be
sustained
by
a
single
mind
goodness
gracious
aunt
pullet
exclaimed
after
preluding
by
an
inarticulate
scream
keep
her
at
the
door
sally
do
bring
her
off
the
whatever
you
do
why
she
tumbled
into
some
nasty
mud
said
tulliver
going
up
to
lucy
to
examine
into
the
amount
of
damage
to
clothes
for
which
she
felt
herself
responsible
to
her
sister
deane
if
you
please
it
was
miss
maggie
as
pushed
her
in
said
sally
master
tom
been
and
said
so
and
they
must
ha
been
to
the
pond
for
it
only
there
they
could
ha
got
into
such
dirt
there
it
is
bessy
it
what
i
been
telling
you
said
pullet
in
a
tone
of
prophetic
sadness
it
your
children
no
knowing
what
they
come
to
tulliver
was
mute
feeling
herself
a
truly
wretched
mother
as
usual
the
thought
pressed
upon
her
that
people
would
think
she
had
done
something
wicked
to
deserve
her
maternal
troubles
while
pullet
began
to
give
elaborate
directions
to
sally
how
to
guard
the
premises
from
serious
injury
in
the
course
of
removing
the
dirt
meantime
tea
was
to
be
brought
in
by
the
cook
and
the
two
naughty
children
were
to
have
theirs
in
an
ignominious
manner
in
the
kitchen
tulliver
went
out
to
speak
to
these
naughty
children
supposing
them
to
be
close
at
hand
but
it
was
not
until
after
some
search
that
she
found
tom
leaning
with
rather
a
hardened
careless
air
against
the
white
paling
of
the
and
lowering
his
piece
of
string
on
the
other
side
as
a
means
of
exasperating
the
tom
you
naughty
boy
where
your
sister
said
tulliver
in
a
distressed
voice
i
do
know
said
tom
his
eagerness
for
justice
on
maggie
had
diminished
since
he
had
seen
clearly
that
it
could
hardly
be
brought
about
without
the
injustice
of
some
blame
on
his
own
conduct
why
where
did
you
leave
her
said
the
mother
looking
round
sitting
under
the
tree
against
the
pond
said
tom
apparently
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
string
and
the
then
go
and
fetch
her
in
this
minute
you
naughty
boy
and
how
could
you
think
o
going
to
the
pond
and
taking
your
sister
where
there
was
dirt
you
know
she
do
mischief
if
there
mischief
to
be
done
it
was
tulliver
way
if
she
blamed
tom
to
refer
his
misdemeanor
somehow
or
other
to
maggie
the
idea
of
maggie
sitting
alone
by
the
pond
roused
an
habitual
fear
in
tulliver
mind
and
she
mounted
the
to
satisfy
herself
by
a
sight
of
that
fatal
child
while
tom
walked
not
very
quickly
on
his
way
toward
her
they
such
children
for
the
water
mine
are
she
said
aloud
without
reflecting
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
her
they
be
brought
in
dead
and
drownded
some
day
i
wish
that
river
was
far
enough
but
when
she
not
only
failed
to
discern
maggie
but
presently
saw
tom
returning
from
the
pool
alone
this
hovering
fear
entered
and
took
complete
possession
of
her
and
she
hurried
to
meet
him
maggie
nowhere
about
the
pond
mother
said
tom
she
gone
away
you
may
conceive
the
terrified
search
for
maggie
and
the
difficulty
of
convincing
her
mother
that
she
was
not
in
the
pond
pullet
observed
that
the
child
might
come
to
a
worse
end
if
she
lived
there
was
no
knowing
and
pullet
confused
and
overwhelmed
by
this
revolutionary
aspect
of
things
the
tea
deferred
and
the
poultry
alarmed
by
the
unusual
running
to
and
fro
took
up
his
spud
as
an
instrument
of
search
and
reached
down
a
key
to
unlock
the
as
a
likely
place
for
maggie
to
lie
concealed
in
tom
after
a
while
started
the
idea
that
maggie
was
gone
home
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
state
that
it
was
what
he
should
have
done
himself
under
the
circumstances
and
the
suggestion
was
seized
as
a
comfort
by
his
mother
sister
for
goodness
sake
let
put
the
horse
in
the
carriage
and
take
me
home
we
shall
perhaps
find
her
on
the
road
lucy
ca
walk
in
her
dirty
clothes
she
said
looking
at
that
innocent
victim
who
was
wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
and
sitting
with
naked
feet
on
the
sofa
aunt
pullet
was
quite
willing
to
take
the
shortest
means
of
restoring
her
premises
to
order
and
quiet
and
it
was
not
long
before
tulliver
was
in
the
chaise
looking
anxiously
at
the
most
distant
point
before
her
what
the
father
would
say
if
maggie
was
lost
was
a
question
that
predominated
over
every
other
chapter
xi
maggie
tries
to
run
away
from
her
shadow
maggie
intentions
as
usual
were
on
a
larger
scale
than
tom
imagined
the
resolution
that
gathered
in
her
mind
after
tom
and
lucy
had
walked
away
was
not
so
simple
as
that
of
going
home
no
she
would
run
away
and
go
to
the
gypsies
and
tom
should
never
see
her
any
more
that
was
by
no
means
a
new
idea
to
maggie
she
had
been
so
often
told
she
was
like
a
gypsy
and
half
wild
that
when
she
was
miserable
it
seemed
to
her
the
only
way
of
escaping
opprobrium
and
being
entirely
in
harmony
with
circumstances
would
be
to
live
in
a
little
brown
tent
on
the
commons
the
gypsies
she
considered
would
gladly
receive
her
and
pay
her
much
respect
on
account
of
her
superior
knowledge
she
had
once
mentioned
her
views
on
this
point
to
tom
and
suggested
that
he
should
stain
his
face
brown
and
they
should
run
away
together
but
tom
rejected
the
scheme
with
contempt
observing
that
gypsies
were
thieves
and
hardly
got
anything
to
eat
and
had
nothing
to
drive
but
a
donkey
however
maggie
thought
her
misery
had
reached
a
pitch
at
which
gypsydom
was
her
refuge
and
she
rose
from
her
seat
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
with
the
sense
that
this
was
a
great
crisis
in
her
life
she
would
run
straight
away
till
she
came
to
dunlow
common
where
there
would
certainly
be
gypsies
and
cruel
tom
and
the
rest
of
her
relations
who
found
fault
with
her
should
never
see
her
any
more
she
thought
of
her
father
as
she
ran
along
but
she
reconciled
herself
to
the
idea
of
parting
with
him
by
determining
that
she
would
secretly
send
him
a
letter
by
a
small
gypsy
who
would
run
away
without
telling
where
she
was
and
just
let
him
know
that
she
was
well
and
happy
and
always
loved
him
very
much
maggie
soon
got
out
of
breath
with
running
but
by
the
time
tom
got
to
the
pond
again
she
was
at
the
distance
of
three
long
fields
and
was
on
the
edge
of
the
lane
leading
to
the
highroad
she
stopped
to
pant
a
little
reflecting
that
running
away
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
until
one
had
got
quite
to
the
common
where
the
gypsies
were
but
her
resolution
had
not
abated
she
presently
passed
through
the
gate
into
the
lane
not
knowing
where
it
would
lead
her
for
it
was
not
this
way
that
they
came
from
dorlcote
mill
to
garum
firs
and
she
felt
all
the
safer
for
that
because
there
was
no
chance
of
her
being
overtaken
but
she
was
soon
aware
not
without
trembling
that
there
were
two
men
coming
along
the
lane
in
front
of
her
she
had
not
thought
of
meeting
strangers
she
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
idea
of
her
friends
coming
after
her
the
formidable
strangers
were
two
men
with
flushed
faces
one
of
them
carrying
a
bundle
on
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
but
to
her
surprise
while
she
was
dreading
their
disapprobation
as
a
runaway
the
man
with
the
bundle
stopped
and
in
a
tone
asked
her
if
she
had
a
copper
to
give
a
poor
man
maggie
had
a
sixpence
in
her
pocket
her
uncle
present
which
she
immediately
drew
out
and
gave
this
poor
man
with
a
polite
smile
hoping
he
would
feel
very
kindly
toward
her
as
a
generous
person
that
the
only
money
i
got
she
said
apologetically
thank
you
little
miss
said
the
man
in
a
less
respectful
and
grateful
tone
than
maggie
anticipated
and
she
even
observed
that
he
smiled
and
winked
at
his
companion
she
walked
on
hurriedly
but
was
aware
that
the
two
men
were
standing
still
probably
to
look
after
her
and
she
presently
heard
them
laughing
loudly
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
they
might
think
she
was
an
idiot
tom
had
said
that
her
cropped
hair
made
her
look
like
an
idiot
and
it
was
too
painful
an
idea
to
be
readily
forgotten
besides
she
had
no
sleeves
on
only
a
cape
and
bonnet
it
was
clear
that
she
was
not
likely
to
make
a
favorable
impression
on
passengers
and
she
thought
she
would
turn
into
the
fields
again
but
not
on
the
same
side
of
the
lane
as
before
lest
they
should
still
be
uncle
fields
she
turned
through
the
first
gate
that
was
not
locked
and
felt
a
delightful
sense
of
privacy
in
creeping
along
by
the
hedgerows
after
her
recent
humiliating
encounter
she
was
used
to
wandering
about
the
fields
by
herself
and
was
less
timid
there
than
on
the
highroad
sometimes
she
had
to
climb
over
high
gates
but
that
was
a
small
evil
she
was
getting
out
of
reach
very
fast
and
she
should
probably
soon
come
within
sight
of
dunlow
common
or
at
least
of
some
other
common
for
she
had
heard
her
father
say
that
you
could
go
very
far
without
coming
to
a
common
she
hoped
so
for
she
was
getting
rather
tired
and
hungry
and
until
she
reached
the
gypsies
there
was
no
definite
prospect
of
bread
and
butter
it
was
still
broad
daylight
for
aunt
pullet
retaining
the
early
habits
of
the
dodson
family
took
tea
at
four
by
the
sun
and
at
five
by
the
kitchen
clock
so
though
it
was
nearly
an
hour
since
maggie
started
there
was
no
gathering
gloom
on
the
fields
to
remind
her
that
the
night
would
come
still
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
walking
a
very
great
distance
indeed
and
it
was
really
surprising
that
the
common
did
not
come
within
sight
hitherto
she
had
been
in
the
rich
parish
of
garum
where
was
a
great
deal
of
and
she
had
only
seen
one
laborer
at
a
distance
that
was
fortunate
in
some
respects
as
laborers
might
be
too
ignorant
to
understand
the
propriety
of
her
wanting
to
go
to
dunlow
common
yet
it
would
have
been
better
if
she
could
have
met
some
one
who
would
tell
her
the
way
without
wanting
to
know
anything
about
her
private
business
at
last
however
the
green
fields
came
to
an
end
and
maggie
found
herself
looking
through
the
bars
of
a
gate
into
a
lane
with
a
wide
margin
of
grass
on
each
side
of
it
she
had
never
seen
such
a
wide
lane
before
and
without
her
knowing
why
it
gave
her
the
impression
that
the
common
could
not
be
far
off
perhaps
it
was
because
she
saw
a
donkey
with
a
log
to
his
foot
feeding
on
the
grassy
margin
for
she
had
seen
a
donkey
with
that
pitiable
encumbrance
on
dunlow
common
when
she
had
been
across
it
in
her
father
gig
she
crept
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
walked
on
with
new
spirit
though
not
without
haunting
images
of
apollyon
and
a
highwayman
with
a
pistol
and
a
blinking
dwarf
in
yellow
with
a
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
and
other
miscellaneous
dangers
for
poor
little
maggie
had
at
once
the
timidity
of
an
active
imagination
and
the
daring
that
comes
from
overmastering
impulse
she
had
rushed
into
the
adventure
of
seeking
her
unknown
kindred
the
gypsies
and
now
she
was
in
this
strange
lane
she
hardly
dared
look
on
one
side
of
her
lest
she
should
see
the
diabolical
blacksmith
in
his
leathern
apron
grinning
at
her
with
arms
akimbo
it
was
not
without
a
leaping
of
the
heart
that
she
caught
sight
of
a
small
pair
of
bare
legs
sticking
up
feet
uppermost
by
the
side
of
a
hillock
they
seemed
something
hideously
preternatural
a
diabolical
kind
of
fungus
for
she
was
too
much
agitated
at
the
first
glance
to
see
the
ragged
clothes
and
the
dark
shaggy
head
attached
to
them
it
was
a
boy
asleep
and
maggie
trotted
along
faster
and
more
lightly
lest
she
should
wake
him
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
was
one
of
her
friends
the
gypsies
who
in
all
probability
would
have
very
genial
manners
but
the
fact
was
so
for
at
the
next
bend
in
the
lane
maggie
actually
saw
the
little
semicircular
black
tent
with
the
blue
smoke
rising
before
it
which
was
to
be
her
refuge
from
all
the
blighting
obloquy
that
had
pursued
her
in
civilized
life
she
even
saw
a
tall
female
figure
by
the
column
of
smoke
doubtless
the
who
provided
the
tea
and
other
groceries
it
was
astonishing
to
herself
that
she
did
not
feel
more
delighted
but
it
was
startling
to
find
the
gypsies
in
a
lane
after
all
and
not
on
a
common
indeed
it
was
rather
disappointing
for
a
mysterious
illimitable
common
where
there
were
to
hide
in
and
one
was
out
of
everybody
reach
had
always
made
part
of
picture
of
gypsy
life
she
went
on
however
and
thought
with
some
comfort
that
gypsies
most
likely
knew
nothing
about
idiots
so
there
was
no
danger
of
their
falling
into
the
mistake
of
setting
her
down
at
the
first
glance
as
an
idiot
it
was
plain
she
had
attracted
attention
for
the
tall
figure
who
proved
to
be
a
young
woman
with
a
baby
on
her
arm
walked
slowly
to
meet
her
maggie
looked
up
in
the
new
face
rather
tremblingly
as
it
approached
and
was
reassured
by
the
thought
that
her
aunt
pullet
and
the
rest
were
right
when
they
called
her
a
gypsy
for
this
face
with
the
bright
dark
eyes
and
the
long
hair
was
really
something
like
what
she
used
to
see
in
the
glass
before
she
cut
her
hair
off
my
little
lady
where
are
you
going
to
the
gypsy
said
in
a
tone
of
coaxing
deference
it
was
delightful
and
just
what
maggie
expected
the
gypsies
saw
at
once
that
she
was
a
little
lady
and
were
prepared
to
treat
her
accordingly
not
any
farther
said
maggie
feeling
as
if
she
were
saying
what
she
had
rehearsed
in
a
dream
i
come
to
stay
with
please
that
pretty
come
then
why
what
a
nice
little
lady
you
are
to
be
sure
said
the
gypsy
taking
her
by
the
hand
maggie
thought
her
very
agreeable
but
wished
she
had
not
been
so
dirty
there
was
quite
a
group
round
the
fire
when
she
reached
it
an
old
gypsy
woman
was
seated
on
the
ground
nursing
her
knees
and
occasionally
poking
a
skewer
into
the
round
kettle
that
sent
forth
an
odorous
steam
two
small
children
were
lying
prone
and
resting
on
their
elbows
something
like
small
sphinxes
and
a
placid
donkey
was
bending
his
head
over
a
tall
girl
who
lying
on
her
back
was
scratching
his
nose
and
indulging
him
with
a
bite
of
excellent
stolen
hay
the
slanting
sunlight
fell
kindly
upon
them
and
the
scene
was
really
very
pretty
and
comfortable
maggie
thought
only
she
hoped
they
would
soon
set
out
the
everything
would
be
quite
charming
when
she
had
taught
the
gypsies
to
use
a
and
to
feel
an
interest
in
books
it
was
a
little
confusing
though
that
the
young
woman
began
to
speak
to
the
old
one
in
a
language
which
maggie
did
not
understand
while
the
tall
girl
who
was
feeding
the
donkey
sat
up
and
stared
at
her
without
offering
any
salutation
at
last
the
old
woman
said
what
my
pretty
lady
are
you
come
to
stay
with
us
sit
ye
down
and
tell
us
where
you
come
from
it
was
just
like
a
story
maggie
liked
to
be
called
pretty
lady
and
treated
in
this
way
she
sat
down
and
said
i
come
from
home
because
i
unhappy
and
i
mean
to
be
a
gypsy
i
live
with
you
if
you
like
and
i
can
teach
you
a
great
many
things
such
a
clever
little
lady
said
the
woman
with
the
baby
sitting
down
by
maggie
and
allowing
baby
to
crawl
and
such
a
pretty
bonnet
and
frock
she
added
taking
off
maggie
bonnet
and
looking
at
it
while
she
made
an
observation
to
the
old
woman
in
the
unknown
language
the
tall
girl
snatched
the
bonnet
and
put
it
on
her
own
head
with
a
grin
but
maggie
was
determined
not
to
show
any
weakness
on
this
subject
as
if
she
were
susceptible
about
her
bonnet
i
do
want
to
wear
a
bonnet
she
said
i
rather
wear
a
red
handkerchief
like
yours
looking
at
her
friend
by
her
side
my
hair
was
quite
long
till
yesterday
when
i
cut
it
off
but
i
dare
say
it
will
grow
again
very
soon
she
added
apologetically
thinking
it
probable
the
gypsies
had
a
strong
prejudice
in
favor
of
long
hair
and
maggie
had
forgotten
even
her
hunger
at
that
moment
in
the
desire
to
conciliate
gypsy
opinion
oh
what
a
nice
little
lady
and
rich
i
sure
said
the
old
woman
did
you
live
in
a
beautiful
house
at
home
yes
my
home
is
pretty
and
i
very
fond
of
the
river
where
we
go
fishing
but
i
often
very
unhappy
i
should
have
liked
to
bring
my
books
with
me
but
i
came
away
in
a
hurry
you
know
but
i
can
tell
you
almost
everything
there
is
in
my
books
i
read
them
so
many
times
and
that
will
amuse
you
and
i
can
tell
you
something
about
geography
too
that
about
the
world
we
live
in
very
useful
and
interesting
did
you
ever
hear
about
columbus
maggie
eyes
had
begun
to
sparkle
and
her
cheeks
to
flush
she
was
really
beginning
to
instruct
the
gypsies
and
gaining
great
influence
over
them
the
gypsies
themselves
were
not
without
amazement
at
this
talk
though
their
attention
was
divided
by
the
contents
of
pocket
which
the
friend
at
her
right
hand
had
by
this
time
emptied
without
attracting
her
notice
is
that
where
you
live
my
little
lady
said
the
old
woman
at
the
mention
of
columbus
oh
no
said
maggie
with
some
pity
columbus
was
a
very
wonderful
man
who
found
out
half
the
world
and
they
put
chains
on
him
and
treated
him
very
badly
you
know
it
in
my
catechism
of
geography
but
perhaps
it
rather
too
long
to
tell
before
tea
want
my
tea
the
last
words
burst
from
maggie
in
spite
of
herself
with
a
sudden
drop
from
patronizing
instruction
to
simple
peevishness
why
she
hungry
poor
little
lady
said
the
younger
woman
give
her
some
o
the
cold
victual
you
been
walking
a
good
way
i
be
bound
my
dear
where
your
home
it
dorlcote
mill
a
good
way
off
said
maggie
my
father
is
tulliver
but
we
must
let
him
know
where
i
am
else
he
fetch
me
home
again
where
does
the
queen
of
the
gypsies
live
what
do
you
want
to
go
to
her
my
little
lady
said
the
younger
woman
the
tall
girl
meanwhile
was
constantly
staring
at
maggie
and
grinning
her
manners
were
certainly
not
agreeable
no
said
maggie
i
only
thinking
that
if
she
is
a
very
good
queen
you
might
be
glad
when
she
died
and
you
could
choose
another
if
i
was
a
queen
i
be
a
very
good
queen
and
kind
to
everybody
here
a
bit
o
nice
victual
then
said
the
old
woman
handing
to
maggie
a
lump
of
dry
bread
which
she
had
taken
from
a
bag
of
scraps
and
a
piece
of
cold
bacon
thank
you
said
maggie
looking
at
the
food
without
taking
it
but
will
you
give
me
some
and
tea
instead
i
do
like
bacon
we
got
no
tea
nor
butter
said
the
old
woman
with
something
like
a
scowl
as
if
she
were
getting
tired
of
coaxing
oh
a
little
bread
and
treacle
would
do
said
maggie
we
ha
got
no
treacle
said
the
old
woman
crossly
whereupon
there
followed
a
sharp
dialogue
between
the
two
women
in
their
unknown
tongue
and
one
of
the
small
sphinxes
snatched
at
the
and
began
to
eat
it
at
this
moment
the
tall
girl
who
had
gone
a
few
yards
off
came
back
and
said
something
which
produced
a
strong
effect
the
old
woman
seeming
to
forget
maggie
hunger
poked
the
skewer
into
the
pot
with
new
vigor
and
the
younger
crept
under
the
tent
and
reached
out
some
platters
and
spoons
maggie
trembled
a
little
and
was
afraid
the
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
meanwhile
the
tall
girl
gave
a
shrill
cry
and
presently
came
running
up
the
boy
whom
maggie
had
passed
as
he
was
sleeping
a
rough
urchin
about
the
age
of
tom
he
stared
at
maggie
and
there
ensued
much
incomprehensible
chattering
she
felt
very
lonely
and
was
quite
sure
she
should
begin
to
cry
before
long
the
gypsies
did
seem
to
mind
her
at
all
and
she
felt
quite
weak
among
them
but
the
springing
tears
were
checked
by
new
terror
when
two
men
came
up
whose
approach
had
been
the
cause
of
the
sudden
excitement
the
elder
of
the
two
carried
a
bag
which
he
flung
down
addressing
the
women
in
a
loud
and
scolding
tone
which
they
answered
by
a
shower
of
treble
sauciness
while
a
black
cur
ran
barking
up
to
maggie
and
threw
her
into
a
tremor
that
only
found
a
new
cause
in
the
curses
with
which
the
younger
man
called
the
dog
off
and
gave
him
a
rap
with
a
great
stick
he
held
in
his
hand
maggie
felt
that
it
was
impossible
she
should
ever
be
queen
of
these
people
or
ever
communicate
to
them
amusing
and
useful
knowledge
both
the
men
now
seemed
to
be
inquiring
about
maggie
for
they
looked
at
her
and
the
tone
of
the
conversation
became
of
that
pacific
kind
which
implies
curiosity
on
one
side
and
the
power
of
satisfying
it
on
the
other
at
last
the
younger
woman
said
in
her
previous
deferential
coaxing
tone
this
nice
little
lady
come
to
live
with
us
are
you
glad
ay
very
glad
said
the
younger
man
who
was
looking
at
silver
thimble
and
other
small
matters
that
had
been
taken
from
her
pocket
he
returned
them
all
except
the
thimble
to
the
younger
woman
with
some
observation
and
she
immediately
restored
them
to
pocket
while
the
men
seated
themselves
and
began
to
attack
the
contents
of
the
kettle
a
stew
of
meat
and
potatoes
which
had
been
taken
off
the
fire
and
turned
out
into
a
yellow
platter
maggie
began
to
think
that
tom
must
be
right
about
the
gypsies
they
must
certainly
be
thieves
unless
the
man
meant
to
return
her
thimble
by
and
by
she
would
willingly
have
given
it
to
him
for
she
was
not
at
all
attached
to
her
thimble
but
the
idea
that
she
was
among
thieves
prevented
her
from
feeling
any
comfort
in
the
revival
of
deference
and
attention
toward
her
all
thieves
except
robin
hood
were
wicked
people
the
women
saw
she
was
frightened
we
got
nothing
nice
for
a
lady
to
eat
said
the
old
woman
in
her
coaxing
tone
and
she
so
hungry
sweet
little
lady
here
my
dear
try
if
you
can
eat
a
bit
o
this
said
the
younger
woman
handing
some
of
the
stew
on
a
brown
dish
with
an
iron
spoon
to
maggie
who
remembering
that
the
old
woman
had
seemed
angry
with
her
for
not
liking
the
dared
not
refuse
the
stew
though
fear
had
chased
away
her
appetite
if
her
father
would
but
come
by
in
the
gig
and
take
her
up
or
even
if
jack
the
giantkiller
or
greatheart
or
george
who
slew
the
dragon
on
the
would
happen
to
pass
that
way
but
maggie
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
that
these
heroes
were
never
seen
in
the
neighborhood
of
ogg
nothing
very
wonderful
ever
came
there
maggie
tulliver
you
perceive
was
by
no
means
that
well
trained
young
person
that
a
small
female
of
eight
or
nine
necessarily
is
in
these
days
she
had
only
been
to
school
a
year
at
ogg
and
had
so
few
books
that
she
sometimes
read
the
dictionary
so
that
in
travelling
over
her
small
mind
you
would
have
found
the
most
unexpected
ignorance
as
well
as
unexpected
knowledge
she
could
have
informed
you
that
there
was
such
a
word
as
polygamy
and
being
also
acquainted
with
polysyllable
she
had
deduced
the
conclusion
that
poly
mean
many
but
she
had
had
no
idea
that
gypsies
were
not
well
supplied
with
groceries
and
her
thoughts
generally
were
the
oddest
mixture
of
acumen
and
blind
dreams
her
ideas
about
the
gypsies
had
undergone
a
rapid
modification
in
the
last
five
minutes
from
having
considered
them
very
respectful
companions
amenable
to
instruction
she
had
begun
to
think
that
they
meant
perhaps
to
kill
her
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
and
cut
up
her
body
for
gradual
cooking
the
suspicion
crossed
her
that
the
old
man
was
in
fact
the
devil
who
might
drop
that
transparent
disguise
at
any
moment
and
turn
either
into
the
grinning
blacksmith
or
else
a
monster
with
dragon
wings
it
was
no
use
trying
to
eat
the
stew
and
yet
the
thing
she
most
dreaded
was
to
offend
the
gypsies
by
betraying
her
extremely
unfavorable
opinion
of
them
and
she
wondered
with
a
keenness
of
interest
that
no
theologian
could
have
exceeded
whether
if
the
devil
were
really
present
he
would
know
her
thoughts
what
you
do
like
the
smell
of
it
my
dear
said
the
young
woman
observing
that
maggie
did
not
even
take
a
spoonful
of
the
stew
try
a
bit
come
no
thank
you
said
maggie
summoning
all
her
force
for
a
desperate
effort
and
trying
to
smile
in
a
friendly
way
i
have
time
i
think
it
seems
getting
darker
i
think
i
must
go
home
now
and
come
again
another
day
and
then
i
can
bring
you
a
basket
with
some
and
things
maggie
rose
from
her
seat
as
she
threw
out
this
illusory
prospect
devoutly
hoping
that
apollyon
was
gullible
but
her
hope
sank
when
the
old
said
stop
a
bit
stop
a
bit
little
lady
we
take
you
home
all
safe
when
we
done
supper
you
shall
ride
home
like
a
lady
maggie
sat
down
again
with
little
faith
in
this
promise
though
she
presently
saw
the
tall
girl
putting
a
bridle
on
the
donkey
and
throwing
a
couple
of
bags
on
his
back
now
then
little
missis
said
the
younger
man
rising
and
leading
the
donkey
forward
tell
us
where
you
live
what
the
name
o
the
place
dorlcote
mill
is
my
home
said
maggie
eagerly
my
father
is
tulliver
he
lives
there
what
a
big
mill
a
little
way
this
side
o
st
ogg
yes
said
maggie
is
it
far
off
i
think
i
should
like
to
walk
there
if
you
please
no
no
it
be
getting
dark
we
must
make
haste
and
the
carry
you
as
nice
as
can
be
you
see
he
lifted
maggie
as
he
spoke
and
set
her
on
the
donkey
she
felt
relieved
that
it
was
not
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
be
going
with
her
but
she
had
only
a
trembling
hope
that
she
was
really
going
home
here
your
pretty
bonnet
said
the
younger
woman
putting
that
recently
despised
but
now
welcome
article
of
costume
on
maggie
head
and
you
say
we
been
very
good
to
you
wo
you
and
what
a
nice
little
lady
we
said
you
was
oh
yes
thank
you
said
maggie
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
wish
you
go
with
me
too
she
thought
anything
was
better
than
going
with
one
of
the
dreadful
men
alone
it
would
be
more
cheerful
to
be
murdered
by
a
larger
party
ah
you
fondest
o
are
you
said
the
woman
but
i
go
you
go
too
fast
for
me
it
now
appeared
that
the
man
also
was
to
be
seated
on
the
donkey
holding
maggie
before
him
and
she
was
as
incapable
of
remonstrating
against
this
arrangement
as
the
donkey
himself
though
no
nightmare
had
ever
seemed
to
her
more
horrible
when
the
woman
had
patted
her
on
the
back
and
said
the
donkey
at
a
strong
hint
from
the
man
stick
set
off
at
a
rapid
walk
along
the
lane
toward
the
point
maggie
had
come
from
an
hour
ago
while
the
tall
girl
and
the
rough
urchin
also
furnished
with
sticks
obligingly
escorted
them
for
the
first
hundred
yards
with
much
screaming
and
thwacking
not
leonore
in
that
preternatural
midnight
excursion
with
her
phantom
lover
was
more
terrified
than
poor
maggie
in
this
entirely
natural
ride
on
a
donkey
with
a
gypsy
behind
her
who
considered
that
he
was
earning
half
a
crown
the
red
light
of
the
setting
sun
seemed
to
have
a
portentous
meaning
with
which
the
alarming
bray
of
the
second
donkey
with
the
log
on
its
foot
must
surely
have
some
connection
two
low
thatched
cottages
the
only
houses
they
passed
in
this
lane
seemed
to
add
to
its
dreariness
they
had
no
windows
to
speak
of
and
the
doors
were
closed
it
was
probable
that
they
were
inhabitated
by
witches
and
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
the
donkey
did
not
stop
there
at
last
oh
sight
of
joy
this
lane
the
longest
in
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
was
opening
on
a
broad
highroad
where
there
was
actually
a
coach
passing
and
there
was
a
at
the
corner
she
had
surely
seen
that
before
to
ogg
miles
the
gypsy
really
meant
to
take
her
home
then
he
was
probably
a
good
man
after
all
and
might
have
been
rather
hurt
at
the
thought
that
she
did
like
coming
with
him
alone
this
idea
became
stronger
as
she
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
she
knew
the
road
quite
well
and
she
was
considering
how
she
might
open
a
conversation
with
the
injured
gypsy
and
not
only
gratify
his
feelings
but
efface
the
impression
of
her
cowardice
when
as
they
reached
a
maggie
caught
sight
of
some
one
coming
on
a
horse
oh
stop
stop
she
cried
out
there
my
father
oh
father
father
the
sudden
joy
was
almost
painful
and
before
her
father
reached
her
she
was
sobbing
great
was
tulliver
wonder
for
he
had
made
a
round
from
basset
and
had
not
yet
been
home
why
what
the
meaning
o
this
he
said
checking
his
horse
while
maggie
slipped
from
the
donkey
and
ran
to
her
father
stirrup
the
little
miss
lost
herself
i
reckon
said
the
gypsy
she
come
to
our
tent
at
the
far
end
o
dunlow
lane
and
i
was
bringing
her
where
she
said
her
home
was
it
a
good
way
to
come
after
being
on
the
tramp
all
day
oh
yes
father
he
been
very
good
to
bring
me
home
said
maggie
a
very
kind
good
man
here
then
my
man
said
tulliver
taking
out
five
shillings
it
the
best
day
work
ever
did
i
could
afford
to
lose
the
little
wench
here
lift
her
up
before
me
why
maggie
how
this
how
this
he
said
as
they
rode
along
while
she
laid
her
head
against
her
father
and
sobbed
how
came
you
to
be
rambling
about
and
lose
yourself
oh
father
sobbed
maggie
i
ran
away
because
i
was
so
unhappy
tom
was
so
angry
with
me
i
could
bear
it
pooh
pooh
said
tulliver
soothingly
you
must
think
running
away
from
father
what
father
do
without
his
little
wench
oh
no
i
never
will
again
father
never
tulliver
spoke
his
mind
very
strongly
when
he
reached
home
that
evening
and
the
effect
was
seen
in
the
remarkable
fact
that
maggie
never
heard
one
reproach
from
her
mother
or
one
taunt
from
tom
about
this
foolish
business
of
her
running
away
to
the
gypsies
maggie
was
rather
by
this
unusual
treatment
and
sometimes
thought
that
her
conduct
had
been
too
wicked
to
be
alluded
to
chapter
xii
and
glegg
at
home
in
order
to
see
and
glegg
at
home
we
must
enter
the
town
of
ogg
that
venerable
town
with
the
red
fluted
roofs
and
the
broad
warehouse
gables
where
the
black
ships
unlade
themselves
of
their
burthens
from
the
far
north
and
carry
away
in
exchange
the
precious
inland
products
the
cheese
and
the
soft
fleeces
which
my
refined
readers
have
doubtless
become
acquainted
with
through
the
medium
of
the
best
classic
pastorals
it
is
one
of
those
old
old
towns
which
impress
one
as
a
continuation
and
outgrowth
of
nature
as
much
as
the
nests
of
the
or
the
winding
galleries
of
the
white
ants
a
town
which
carries
the
traces
of
its
long
growth
and
history
like
a
millennial
tree
and
has
sprung
up
and
developed
in
the
same
spot
between
the
river
and
the
low
hill
from
the
time
when
the
roman
legions
turned
their
backs
on
it
from
the
camp
on
the
hillside
and
the
came
up
the
river
and
looked
with
fierce
eager
eyes
at
the
fatness
of
the
land
it
is
a
town
familiar
with
forgotten
years
the
shadow
of
the
saxon
still
walks
there
fitfully
reviewing
the
scenes
of
his
youth
and
and
is
met
by
the
gloomier
shadow
of
the
dreadful
heathen
dane
who
was
stabbed
in
the
midst
of
his
warriors
by
the
sword
of
an
invisible
avenger
and
who
rises
on
autumn
evenings
like
a
white
mist
from
his
tumulus
on
the
hill
and
hovers
in
the
court
of
the
old
hall
by
the
the
spot
where
he
was
thus
miraculously
slain
in
the
days
before
the
old
hall
was
built
it
was
the
normans
who
began
to
build
that
fine
old
hall
which
is
like
the
town
telling
of
the
thoughts
and
hands
of
widely
sundered
generations
but
it
is
all
so
old
that
we
look
with
loving
pardon
at
its
inconsistencies
and
are
well
content
that
they
who
built
the
stone
oriel
and
they
who
built
the
gothic
façade
and
towers
of
finest
small
brickwork
with
the
trefoil
ornament
and
the
windows
and
battlements
defined
with
stone
did
not
sacreligiously
pull
down
the
ancient
body
with
its
but
older
even
than
this
old
hall
is
perhaps
the
bit
of
wall
now
built
into
the
belfry
of
the
parish
church
and
said
to
be
a
remnant
of
the
original
chapel
dedicated
to
ogg
the
patron
saint
of
this
ancient
town
of
whose
history
i
possess
several
manuscript
versions
i
incline
to
the
briefest
since
if
it
should
not
be
wholly
true
it
is
at
least
likely
to
contain
the
least
falsehood
ogg
the
son
of
beorl
says
my
private
hagiographer
was
a
boatman
who
gained
a
scanty
living
by
ferrying
passengers
across
the
river
floss
and
it
came
to
pass
one
evening
when
the
winds
were
high
that
there
sat
moaning
by
the
brink
of
the
river
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
she
was
clad
in
rags
and
had
a
worn
and
withered
look
and
she
craved
to
be
rowed
across
the
river
and
the
men
thereabout
questioned
her
and
said
dost
thou
desire
to
cross
the
river
tarry
till
the
morning
and
take
shelter
here
for
the
night
so
shalt
thou
be
wise
and
not
foolish
still
she
went
on
to
mourn
and
crave
but
ogg
the
son
of
beorl
came
up
and
said
will
ferry
thee
across
it
is
enough
that
thy
heart
needs
it
and
he
ferried
her
across
and
it
came
to
pass
when
she
stepped
ashore
that
her
rags
were
turned
into
robes
of
flowing
white
and
her
face
became
bright
with
exceeding
beauty
and
there
was
a
glory
around
it
so
that
she
shed
a
light
on
the
water
like
the
moon
in
its
brightness
and
she
said
the
son
of
beorl
thou
art
blessed
in
that
thou
didst
not
question
and
wrangle
with
the
heart
need
but
wast
smitten
with
pity
and
didst
straightway
relieve
the
same
and
from
henceforth
whoso
steps
into
thy
boat
shall
be
in
no
peril
from
the
storm
and
whenever
it
puts
forth
to
the
rescue
it
shall
save
the
lives
both
of
men
and
beasts
and
when
the
floods
came
many
were
saved
by
reason
of
that
blessing
on
the
boat
but
when
ogg
the
son
of
beorl
died
behold
in
the
parting
of
his
soul
the
boat
loosed
itself
from
its
moorings
and
was
floated
with
the
ebbing
tide
in
great
swiftness
to
the
ocean
and
was
seen
no
more
yet
it
was
witnessed
in
the
floods
of
aftertime
that
at
the
coming
on
of
eventide
ogg
the
son
of
beorl
was
always
seen
with
his
boat
upon
the
waters
and
the
blessed
virgin
sat
in
the
prow
shedding
a
light
around
as
of
the
moon
in
its
brightness
so
that
the
rowers
in
the
gathering
darkness
took
heart
and
pulled
anew
this
legend
one
sees
reflects
from
a
time
the
visitation
of
the
floods
which
even
when
they
left
human
life
untouched
were
widely
fatal
to
the
helpless
cattle
and
swept
as
sudden
death
over
all
smaller
living
things
but
the
town
knew
worse
troubles
even
than
the
floods
troubles
of
the
civil
wars
when
it
was
a
continual
where
first
puritans
thanked
god
for
the
blood
of
the
loyalists
and
then
loyalists
thanked
god
for
the
blood
of
the
puritans
many
honest
citizens
lost
all
their
possessions
for
conscience
sake
in
those
times
and
went
forth
beggared
from
their
native
town
doubtless
there
are
many
houses
standing
now
on
which
those
honest
citizens
turned
their
backs
in
sorrow
houses
looking
on
the
river
jammed
between
newer
warehouses
and
penetrated
by
surprising
passages
which
turn
and
turn
at
sharp
angles
till
they
lead
you
out
on
a
muddy
strand
overflowed
continually
by
the
rushing
tide
everywhere
the
brick
houses
have
a
mellow
look
and
in
glegg
day
there
was
no
incongruous
smartness
no
in
no
fresh
or
other
fallacious
attempt
to
make
fine
old
red
ogg
wear
the
air
of
a
town
that
sprang
up
yesterday
the
were
small
and
unpretending
for
the
farmers
wives
and
daughters
who
came
to
do
their
shopping
on
were
not
to
be
withdrawn
from
their
regular
shops
and
the
tradesmen
had
no
wares
intended
for
customers
who
would
go
on
their
way
and
be
seen
no
more
ah
even
glegg
day
seems
far
back
in
the
past
now
separated
from
us
by
changes
that
widen
the
years
war
and
the
rumor
of
war
had
then
died
out
from
the
minds
of
men
and
if
they
were
ever
thought
of
by
the
farmers
in
drab
greatcoats
who
shook
the
grain
out
of
their
and
buzzed
over
it
in
the
full
it
was
as
a
state
of
things
that
belonged
to
a
past
golden
age
when
prices
were
high
surely
the
time
was
gone
forever
when
the
broad
river
could
bring
up
unwelcome
ships
russia
was
only
the
place
where
the
linseed
came
from
the
more
the
better
making
grist
for
the
great
vertical
millstones
with
their
arms
roaring
and
grinding
and
carefully
sweeping
as
if
an
informing
soul
were
in
them
the
catholics
bad
harvests
and
the
mysterious
fluctuations
of
trade
were
the
three
evils
mankind
had
to
fear
even
the
floods
had
not
been
great
of
late
years
the
mind
of
ogg
did
not
look
extensively
before
or
after
it
inherited
a
long
past
without
thinking
of
it
and
had
no
eyes
for
the
spirits
that
walk
the
streets
since
the
centuries
when
ogg
with
his
boat
and
the
virgin
mother
at
the
prow
had
been
seen
on
the
wide
water
so
many
memories
had
been
left
behind
and
had
gradually
vanished
like
the
receding
hilltops
and
the
present
time
was
like
the
level
plain
where
men
lose
their
belief
in
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
thinking
will
be
as
yesterday
and
the
giant
forces
that
used
to
shake
the
earth
are
forever
laid
to
sleep
the
days
were
gone
when
people
could
be
greatly
wrought
upon
by
their
faith
still
less
change
it
the
catholics
were
formidable
because
they
would
lay
hold
of
government
and
property
and
burn
men
alive
not
because
any
sane
and
honest
parishioner
of
ogg
could
be
brought
to
believe
in
the
pope
one
aged
person
remembered
how
a
rude
multitude
had
been
swayed
when
john
wesley
preached
in
the
but
for
a
long
while
it
had
not
been
expected
of
preachers
that
they
should
shake
the
souls
of
men
an
occasional
burst
of
fervor
in
dissenting
pulpits
on
the
subject
of
infant
baptism
was
the
only
symptom
of
a
zeal
unsuited
to
sober
times
when
men
had
done
with
change
protestantism
sat
at
ease
unmindful
of
schisms
careless
of
proselytism
dissent
was
an
inheritance
along
with
a
superior
pew
and
a
business
connection
and
churchmanship
only
wondered
contemptuously
at
dissent
as
a
foolish
habit
that
clung
greatly
to
families
in
the
grocery
and
chandlering
lines
though
not
incompatible
with
prosperous
wholesale
dealing
but
with
the
catholic
question
had
come
a
slight
wind
of
controversy
to
break
the
calm
the
elderly
rector
had
become
occasionally
historical
and
argumentative
and
spray
the
independent
minister
had
begun
to
preach
political
sermons
in
which
he
distinguished
with
much
subtlety
between
his
fervent
belief
in
the
right
of
the
catholics
to
the
franchise
and
his
fervent
belief
in
their
eternal
perdition
most
of
hearers
however
were
incapable
of
following
his
subtleties
and
many
dissenters
were
much
pained
by
his
siding
with
the
catholics
while
others
thought
he
had
better
let
politics
alone
public
spirit
was
not
held
in
high
esteem
at
ogg
and
men
who
busied
themselves
with
political
questions
were
regarded
with
some
suspicion
as
dangerous
characters
they
were
usually
persons
who
had
little
or
no
business
of
their
own
to
manage
or
if
they
had
were
likely
enough
to
become
insolvent
this
was
the
general
aspect
of
things
at
ogg
in
day
and
at
that
particular
period
in
her
family
history
when
she
had
had
her
quarrel
with
tulliver
it
was
a
time
when
ignorance
was
much
more
comfortable
than
at
present
and
was
received
with
all
the
honors
in
very
good
society
without
being
obliged
to
dress
itself
in
an
elaborate
costume
of
knowledge
a
time
when
cheap
periodicals
were
not
and
when
country
surgeons
never
thought
of
asking
their
female
patients
if
they
were
fond
of
reading
but
simply
took
it
for
granted
that
they
preferred
gossip
a
time
when
ladies
in
rich
silk
gowns
wore
large
pockets
in
which
they
carried
a
to
secure
them
against
cramp
glegg
carried
such
a
bone
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
grandmother
with
a
brocaded
gown
that
would
stand
up
empty
like
a
suit
of
armor
and
a
for
the
dodson
family
had
been
respectable
for
many
generations
glegg
had
both
a
front
and
a
back
parlor
in
her
excellent
house
at
ogg
so
that
she
had
two
points
of
view
from
which
she
could
observe
the
weakness
of
her
and
reinforce
her
thankfulness
for
her
own
exceptional
strength
of
mind
from
her
front
window
she
could
look
down
the
tofton
road
leading
out
of
ogg
and
note
the
growing
tendency
to
gadding
about
in
the
wives
of
men
not
retired
from
business
together
with
a
practice
of
wearing
woven
cotton
stockings
which
opened
a
dreary
prospect
for
the
coming
generation
and
from
her
back
windows
she
could
look
down
the
pleasant
garden
and
orchard
which
stretched
to
the
river
and
observe
the
folly
of
glegg
in
spending
his
time
among
them
flowers
and
vegetables
for
glegg
having
retired
from
active
business
as
a
for
the
purpose
of
enjoying
himself
through
the
rest
of
his
life
had
found
this
last
occupation
so
much
more
severe
than
his
business
that
he
had
been
driven
into
amateur
hard
labor
as
a
dissipation
and
habitually
relaxed
by
doing
the
work
of
two
ordinary
gardeners
the
economizing
of
a
gardener
wages
might
perhaps
have
induced
glegg
to
wink
at
this
folly
if
it
were
possible
for
a
healthy
female
mind
even
to
simulate
respect
for
a
husband
hobby
but
it
is
well
known
that
this
conjugal
complacency
belongs
only
to
the
weaker
portion
of
the
sex
who
are
scarcely
alive
to
the
responsibilities
of
a
wife
as
a
constituted
check
on
her
husband
pleasures
which
are
hardly
ever
of
a
rational
or
commendable
kind
glegg
on
his
side
too
had
a
double
source
of
mental
occupation
which
gave
every
promise
of
being
inexhaustible
on
the
one
hand
he
surprised
himself
by
his
discoveries
in
natural
history
finding
that
his
piece
of
contained
wonderful
caterpillars
slugs
and
insects
which
so
far
as
he
had
heard
had
never
before
attracted
human
observation
and
he
noticed
remarkable
coincidences
between
these
zoological
phenomena
and
the
great
events
of
that
time
as
for
example
that
before
the
burning
of
york
minster
there
had
been
mysterious
serpentine
marks
on
the
leaves
of
the
together
with
an
unusual
prevalence
of
slugs
which
he
had
been
puzzled
to
know
the
meaning
of
until
it
flashed
upon
him
with
this
melancholy
conflagration
glegg
had
an
unusual
amount
of
mental
activity
which
when
disengaged
from
the
wool
business
naturally
made
itself
a
pathway
in
other
directions
and
his
second
subject
of
meditation
was
the
contrairiness
of
the
female
mind
as
typically
exhibited
in
glegg
that
a
creature
made
in
a
genealogical
sense
out
of
a
rib
and
in
this
particular
case
maintained
in
the
highest
respectability
without
any
trouble
of
her
own
should
be
normally
in
a
state
of
contradiction
to
the
blandest
propositions
and
even
to
the
most
accommodating
concessions
was
a
mystery
in
the
scheme
of
things
to
which
he
had
often
in
vain
sought
a
clew
in
the
early
chapters
of
genesis
glegg
had
chosen
the
eldest
miss
dodson
as
a
handsome
embodiment
of
female
prudence
and
thrift
and
being
himself
of
a
turn
had
calculated
on
much
conjugal
harmony
but
in
that
curious
compound
the
feminine
character
it
may
easily
happen
that
the
flavor
is
unpleasant
in
spite
of
excellent
ingredients
and
a
fine
systematic
stinginess
may
be
accompanied
with
a
seasoning
that
quite
spoils
its
relish
now
good
glegg
himself
was
stingy
in
the
most
amiable
manner
his
neighbors
called
him
near
which
always
means
that
the
person
in
question
is
a
lovable
skinflint
if
you
expressed
a
preference
for
glegg
would
remember
to
save
them
for
you
with
a
delight
in
gratifying
your
palate
and
he
was
given
to
pet
all
animals
which
required
no
appreciable
keep
there
was
no
humbug
or
hypocrisy
about
glegg
his
eyes
would
have
watered
with
true
feeling
over
the
sale
of
a
widow
furniture
which
a
note
from
his
side
pocket
would
have
prevented
but
a
donation
of
five
pounds
to
a
person
in
a
small
way
of
life
would
have
seemed
to
him
a
mad
kind
of
lavishness
rather
than
charity
which
had
always
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
contribution
of
small
aids
not
a
neutralizing
of
misfortune
and
glegg
was
just
as
fond
of
saving
other
people
money
as
his
own
he
would
have
ridden
as
far
round
to
avoid
a
turnpike
when
his
expenses
were
to
be
paid
for
him
as
when
they
were
to
come
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
was
quite
zealous
in
trying
to
induce
indifferent
acquaintances
to
adopt
a
cheap
substitute
for
blacking
this
inalienable
habit
of
saving
as
an
end
in
itself
belonged
to
the
industrious
men
of
business
of
a
former
generation
who
made
their
fortunes
slowly
almost
as
the
tracking
of
the
fox
belongs
to
the
harrier
it
constituted
them
a
race
which
is
nearly
lost
in
these
days
of
rapid
when
lavishness
comes
close
on
the
back
of
want
in
times
an
independence
was
hardly
ever
made
without
a
little
miserliness
as
a
condition
and
you
would
have
found
that
quality
in
every
provincial
district
combined
with
characters
as
various
as
the
fruits
from
which
we
can
extract
acid
the
true
harpagons
were
always
marked
and
exceptional
characters
not
so
the
worthy
who
having
once
pinched
from
real
necessity
retained
even
in
the
midst
of
their
comfortable
retirement
with
their
wallfruit
and
the
habit
of
regarding
life
as
an
ingenious
process
of
nibbling
out
one
livelihood
without
leaving
any
perceptible
deficit
and
who
would
have
been
as
immediately
prompted
to
give
up
a
newly
taxed
luxury
when
they
had
had
their
clear
five
hundred
a
year
as
when
they
had
only
five
hundred
pounds
of
capital
glegg
was
one
of
these
men
found
so
impracticable
by
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
and
knowing
this
you
will
be
the
better
able
to
understand
why
he
had
not
swerved
from
the
conviction
that
he
had
made
an
eligible
marriage
in
spite
of
the
seasoning
that
nature
had
given
to
the
eldest
miss
dodson
virtues
a
man
with
an
affectionate
disposition
who
finds
a
wife
to
concur
with
his
fundamental
idea
of
life
easily
comes
to
persuade
himself
that
no
other
woman
would
have
suited
him
so
well
and
does
a
little
daily
snapping
and
quarrelling
without
any
sense
of
alienation
glegg
being
of
a
reflective
turn
and
no
longer
occupied
with
wool
had
much
wondering
meditation
on
the
peculiar
constitution
of
the
female
mind
as
unfolded
to
him
in
his
domestic
life
and
yet
he
thought
glegg
household
ways
a
model
for
her
sex
it
struck
him
as
a
pitiable
irregularity
in
other
women
if
they
did
not
roll
up
their
with
the
same
tightness
and
emphasis
as
glegg
did
if
their
pastry
had
a
less
leathery
consistence
and
their
damson
cheese
a
less
venerable
hardness
than
hers
nay
even
the
peculiar
combination
of
grocery
and
druglike
odors
in
glegg
private
cupboard
impressed
him
as
the
only
right
thing
in
the
way
of
cupboard
smells
i
am
not
sure
that
he
would
not
have
longed
for
the
quarrelling
again
if
it
had
ceased
for
an
entire
week
and
it
is
certain
that
an
acquiescent
mild
wife
would
have
left
his
meditations
comparatively
jejune
and
barren
of
mystery
glegg
unmistakable
was
shown
in
this
that
it
pained
him
more
to
see
his
wife
at
variance
with
others
even
with
dolly
the
servant
than
to
be
in
a
state
of
cavil
with
her
himself
and
the
quarrel
between
her
and
tulliver
vexed
him
so
much
that
it
quite
nullified
the
pleasure
he
would
otherwise
have
had
in
the
state
of
his
early
cabbages
as
he
walked
in
his
garden
before
breakfast
the
next
morning
still
he
went
in
to
breakfast
with
some
slight
hope
that
now
glegg
had
slept
upon
it
her
anger
might
be
subdued
enough
to
give
way
to
her
usually
strong
sense
of
family
decorum
she
had
been
used
to
boast
that
there
had
never
been
any
of
those
deadly
quarrels
among
the
dodsons
which
had
disgraced
other
families
that
no
dodson
had
ever
been
cut
off
with
a
shilling
and
no
cousin
of
the
dodsons
disowned
as
indeed
why
should
they
be
for
they
had
no
cousins
who
had
not
money
out
at
use
or
some
houses
of
their
own
at
the
very
least
there
was
one
which
had
always
disappeared
from
glegg
brow
when
she
sat
at
the
it
was
her
fuzzy
front
of
curls
for
as
she
occupied
herself
in
household
matters
in
the
morning
it
would
have
been
a
mere
extravagance
to
put
on
anything
so
superfluous
to
the
making
of
leathery
pastry
as
a
fuzzy
curled
front
by
ten
decorum
demanded
the
front
until
then
glegg
could
economize
it
and
society
would
never
be
any
the
wiser
but
the
absence
of
that
cloud
only
left
it
more
apparent
that
the
cloud
of
severity
remained
and
glegg
perceiving
this
as
he
sat
down
to
his
milkporridge
which
it
was
his
old
frugal
habit
to
stem
his
morning
hunger
with
prudently
resolved
to
leave
the
first
remark
to
glegg
lest
to
so
delicate
an
article
as
a
lady
temper
the
slightest
touch
should
do
mischief
people
who
seem
to
enjoy
their
ill
temper
have
a
way
of
keeping
it
in
fine
condition
by
inflicting
privations
on
themselves
that
was
glegg
way
she
made
her
tea
weaker
than
usual
this
morning
and
declined
butter
it
was
a
hard
case
that
a
vigorous
mood
for
quarrelling
so
highly
capable
of
using
an
opportunity
should
not
meet
with
a
single
remark
from
glegg
on
which
to
exercise
itself
but
by
and
by
it
appeared
that
his
silence
would
answer
the
purpose
for
he
heard
himself
apostrophized
at
last
in
that
tone
peculiar
to
the
wife
of
one
bosom
well
glegg
it
a
poor
return
i
get
for
making
you
the
wife
i
made
you
all
these
years
if
this
is
the
way
i
to
be
treated
i
better
ha
known
it
before
my
poor
father
died
and
then
when
wanted
a
home
i
should
ha
gone
elsewhere
as
the
choice
was
offered
me
glegg
paused
from
his
porridge
and
looked
up
not
with
any
new
amazement
but
simply
with
that
quiet
habitual
wonder
with
which
we
regard
constant
mysteries
why
what
have
i
done
now
done
now
glegg
now
i
sorry
for
you
not
seeing
his
way
to
any
pertinent
answer
glegg
reverted
to
his
porridge
there
husbands
in
the
world
continued
glegg
after
a
pause
as
have
known
how
to
do
something
different
to
siding
with
everybody
else
against
their
own
wives
perhaps
i
wrong
and
you
can
teach
me
better
but
i
allays
heard
as
it
the
husband
place
to
stand
by
the
wife
instead
o
rejoicing
and
triumphing
when
folks
insult
her
now
what
call
have
you
to
say
that
said
glegg
rather
warmly
for
though
a
kind
man
he
was
not
as
meek
as
moses
when
did
i
rejoice
or
triumph
over
you
there
ways
o
doing
things
worse
than
speaking
out
plain
glegg
i
sooner
you
tell
me
to
my
face
as
you
make
light
of
me
than
try
to
make
out
as
everybody
in
the
right
but
me
and
come
to
your
breakfast
in
the
morning
as
i
hardly
slept
an
hour
this
night
and
sulk
at
me
as
if
i
was
the
dirt
under
your
feet
sulk
at
you
said
glegg
in
a
tone
of
angry
facetiousness
you
like
a
tipsy
man
as
thinks
everybody
had
too
much
but
himself
do
lower
yourself
with
using
coarse
language
to
glegg
it
makes
you
look
very
small
though
you
ca
see
yourself
said
glegg
in
a
tone
of
energetic
compassion
a
man
in
your
place
should
set
an
example
and
talk
more
sensible
yes
but
will
you
listen
to
sense
retorted
glegg
sharply
the
best
sense
i
can
talk
to
you
is
what
i
said
last
night
as
you
the
wrong
to
think
o
calling
in
your
money
when
it
safe
enough
if
you
let
it
alone
all
because
of
a
bit
of
a
tiff
and
i
was
in
hopes
you
ha
altered
your
mind
this
morning
but
if
you
like
to
call
it
in
do
do
it
in
a
hurry
now
and
breed
more
enmity
in
the
family
but
wait
till
there
a
pretty
mortgage
to
be
had
without
any
trouble
you
have
to
set
the
lawyer
to
work
now
to
find
an
investment
and
make
no
end
o
expense
glegg
felt
there
was
really
something
in
this
but
she
tossed
her
head
and
emitted
a
guttural
interjection
to
indicate
that
her
silence
was
only
an
armistice
not
a
peace
and
in
fact
hostilities
soon
broke
out
again
i
thank
you
for
my
cup
o
tea
now
said
glegg
seeing
that
she
did
not
proceed
to
give
it
him
as
usual
when
he
had
finished
his
porridge
she
lifted
the
teapot
with
a
slight
toss
of
the
head
and
said
i
glad
to
hear
you
me
glegg
it
little
thanks
get
for
what
i
do
for
folks
i
this
world
though
there
never
a
woman
o
side
o
the
family
glegg
as
is
fit
to
stand
up
with
me
and
i
say
it
if
i
was
on
my
dying
bed
not
but
what
allays
conducted
myself
civil
to
your
kin
and
there
is
one
of
can
say
the
contrary
though
my
equils
they
are
and
nobody
shall
make
me
say
it
you
better

you

with
angry
sarcasm
i
trouble
you
for
the
that
as
false
a
word
as
ever
you
spoke
glegg
said
the
lady
pouring
out
the
milk
with
unusual
profuseness
as
much
as
to
say
if
he
wanted
milk
he
should
have
it
with
a
vengeance
and
you
know
false
i
not
the
woman
to
quarrel
with
my
own
kin
may
for
i
known
you
to
do
it
why
what
did
you
call
it
yesterday
then
leaving
your
house
in
a
tantrum
i
no
quarrel
wi
my
sister
glegg
and
it
false
to
say
it
tulliver
none
o
my
blood
and
it
was
him
quarrelled
with
me
and
drove
me
out
o
the
house
but
perhaps
you
have
had
me
stay
and
be
swore
at
glegg
perhaps
you
was
vexed
not
to
hear
more
abuse
and
foul
language
poured
out
upo
your
own
wife
but
let
me
tell
you
it
disgrace
did
ever
anybody
hear
the
like
i
this
parish
said
glegg
getting
hot
a
woman
with
everything
provided
for
her
and
allowed
to
keep
her
own
money
the
same
as
if
it
was
settled
on
her
and
with
a
gig
new
stuffed
and
lined
at
no
end
o
expense
and
provided
for
when
i
die
beyond
anything
she
could
expect
to
go
on
i
this
way
biting
and
snapping
like
a
mad
dog
it
beyond
everything
as
god
a
should
ha
made
women
these
last
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
sorrowful
agitation
glegg
pushed
his
tea
from
him
and
tapped
the
table
with
both
his
hands
well
glegg
if
those
are
your
feelings
it
best
they
should
be
known
said
glegg
taking
off
her
napkin
and
folding
it
in
an
excited
manner
but
if
you
talk
o
my
being
provided
for
beyond
what
i
could
expect
i
beg
leave
to
tell
you
as
i
a
right
to
expect
a
many
things
as
i
do
find
and
as
to
my
being
like
a
mad
dog
well
if
you
not
cried
shame
on
by
the
county
for
your
treatment
of
me
for
it
what

across

and
took
down

everlasting
rest
which
she
carried
with
her
it
was
the
book
she
was
accustomed
to
lay
open
before
her
on
special
occasions
on
wet
sunday
mornings
or
when
she
heard
of
a
death
in
the
family
or
when
as
in
this
case
her
quarrel
with
glegg
had
been
set
an
octave
higher
than
usual
but
glegg
carried
something
else
with
her
which
together
with
the
saints
rest
and
the
gruel
may
have
had
some
influence
in
gradually
calming
her
feelings
and
making
it
possible
for
her
to
endure
existence
on
the
shortly
before
this
was
partly
glegg
suggestion
that
she
would
do
well
to
let
her
five
hundred
lie
still
until
a
good
investment
turned
up
and
further
his
parenthetic
hint
at
his
handsome
provision
for
her
in
case
of
his
death
glegg
like
all
men
of
his
stamp
was
extremely
reticent
about
his
will
and
glegg
in
her
gloomier
moments
had
forebodings
that
like
other
husbands
of
whom
she
had
heard
he
might
cherish
the
mean
project
of
heightening
her
grief
at
his
death
by
leaving
her
poorly
off
in
which
case
she
was
firmly
resolved
that
she
would
have
scarcely
any
weeper
on
her
bonnet
and
would
cry
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
a
second
husband
but
if
he
had
really
shown
her
any
testamentary
tenderness
it
would
be
affecting
to
think
of
him
poor
man
when
he
was
gone
and
even
his
foolish
fuss
about
the
flowers
and
and
his
insistence
on
the
subject
of
snails
would
be
touching
when
it
was
once
fairly
at
an
end
to
survive
glegg
and
talk
eulogistically
of
him
as
a
man
who
might
have
his
weaknesses
but
who
had
done
the
right
thing
by
her
his
numerous
poor
relations
to
have
sums
of
interest

to

this
made
a
flattering
and
conciliatory
view
of
the

good
glegg
restored
to

humor
by
much

and
moved
by

answered
magnanimously
quite
as

she
had
been
an
uninjured
woman

then
there

somebody

hours
by

if
people
are
to
quarrel
often
it
follows
as
a
corollary
that
their
quarrels
can
not
be
protracted
beyond
certain
limits
and
glegg
talked
quite
amicably
about
the
tullivers
that
evening
glegg
went
the
length
of
admitting
that
tulliver
was
a
sad
man
for
getting
into
hot
water
and
was
like
enough
to
run
through
his
property
and
glegg
meeting
this
acknowledgment
declared
that
it
was
beneath
her
to
take
notice
of
such
a
conduct
and
that
for
her
sister
sake
she
would
let
him
keep
the
five
hundred
a
while
longer
for
when
she
put
it
out
on
a
mortgage
she
should
only
get

further
entangles
the
skein
of
life
owing
to
this
new
adjustment
of
glegg
thoughts
pullet
found
her
task
of
mediation
the
next
day
surprisingly
easy
glegg
indeed
checked
her
rather
sharply
for
thinking
it
would
be
necessary
to
tell
her
elder
sister
what
was
the
right
mode
of
behavior
in
family
matters
pullet
argument
that
it
would
look
ill
in
the
neighborhood
if
people
should
have
it
in
their
power
to
say
that
there
was
a
quarrel
in
the
family
was
particularly
offensive
if
the
family
name
never
suffered
except
through
glegg
pullet
might
lay
her
head
on
her
pillow
in
perfect
confidence
it
not
to
be
expected
i
suppose
observed
glegg
by
way
of
winding
up
the
subject
as
i
shall
go
to
the
mill
again
before
bessy
comes
to
see
me
or
as
i
shall
go
and
fall
down
o
my
knees
to
tulliver
and
ask
his
pardon
for
showing
him
favors
but
i
shall
bear
no
malice
and
when
tulliver
speaks
civil
to
me
i
speak
civil
to
him
nobody
has
any
call
to
tell
me
what
becoming
finding
it
unnecessary
to
plead
for
the
tullivers
it
was
natural
that
aunt
pullet
should
relax
a
little
in
her
anxiety
for
them
and
recur
to
the
annoyance
she
had
suffered
yesterday
from
the
offspring
of
that
apparently
house
glegg
heard
a
circumstantial
narrative
to
which
pullet
remarkable
memory
furnished
some
items
and
while
aunt
pullet
pitied
poor
bessy
bad
luck
with
her
children
and
expressed
a
project
of
paying
for
being
sent
to
a
distant
which
would
not
prevent
her
being
so
brown
but
might
tend
to
subdue
some
other
vices
in
her
aunt
glegg
blamed
bessy
for
her
weakness
and
appealed
to
all
witnesses
who
should
be
living
when
the
tulliver
children
had
turned
out
ill
that
she
glegg
had
always
said
how
it
would
be
from
the
very
first
observing
that
it
was
wonderful
to
herself
how
all
her
words
came
true
then
i
may
call
and
tell
bessy
you
bear
no
malice
and
everything
be
as
it
was
before
pullet
said
just
before
parting
yes
you
may
sophy
said
glegg
you
may
tell
tulliver
and
bessy
too
as
i
not
going
to
behave
ill
because
folks
behave
ill
to
me
i
know
it
my
place
as
the
eldest
to
set
an
example
in
every
respect
and
i
do
it
nobody
can
say
different
of
me
if
they
keep
to
the
truth
glegg
being
in
this
state
of
satisfaction
in
her
own
lofty
magnanimity
i
leave
you
to
judge
what
effect
was
produced
on
her
by
the
reception
of
a
short
letter
from
tulliver
that
very
evening
after
pullet
departure
informing
her
that
she
need
trouble
her
mind
about
her
five
hundred
pounds
for
it
should
be
paid
back
to
her
in
the
course
of
the
next
month
at
farthest
together
with
the
interest
due
thereon
until
the
time
of
payment
and
furthermore
that
tulliver
had
no
wish
to
behave
uncivilly
to
glegg
and
she
was
welcome
to
his
house
whenever
she
liked
to
come
but
he
desired
no
favors
from
her
either
for
himself
or
his
children
it
was
poor
tulliver
who
had
hastened
this
catastrophe
entirely
through
that
irrepressible
hopefulness
of
hers
which
led
her
to
expect
that
similar
causes
may
at
any
time
produce
different
results
it
had
very
often
occurred
in
her
experience
that
tulliver
had
done
something
because
other
people
had
said
he
was
not
able
to
do
it
or
had
pitied
him
for
his
supposed
inability
or
in
any
other
way
piqued
his
pride
still
she
thought
if
she
told
him
when
he
came
in
to
tea
that
sister
pullet
was
gone
to
try
and
make
everything
up
with
sister
glegg
so
that
he
need
think
about
paying
in
the
money
it
would
give
a
cheerful
effect
to
the
meal
tulliver
had
never
slackened
in
his
resolve
to
raise
the
money
but
now
he
at
once
determined
to
write
a
letter
to
glegg
which
should
cut
off
all
possibility
of
mistake
pullet
gone
to
beg
and
pray
for
indeed
tulliver
did
not
willingly
write
a
letter
and
found
the
relation
between
spoken
and
written
language
briefly
known
as
spelling
one
of
the
most
puzzling
things
in
this
puzzling
world
nevertheless
like
all
fervid
writing
the
task
was
done
in
less
time
than
usual
and
if
the
spelling
differed
from
glegg
why
she
belonged
like
himself
to
a
generation
with
whom
spelling
was
a
matter
of
private
judgment
glegg
did
not
alter
her
will
in
consequence
of
this
letter
and
cut
off
the
tulliver
children
from
their
sixth
and
seventh
share
in
her
thousand
pounds
for
she
had
her
principles
no
one
must
be
able
to
say
of
her
when
she
was
dead
that
she
had
not
divided
her
money
with
perfect
fairness
among
her
own
kin
in
the
matter
of
wills
personal
qualities
were
subordinate
to
the
great
fundamental
fact
of
blood
and
to
be
determined
in
the
distribution
of
your
property
by
caprice
and
not
make
your
legacies
bear
a
direct
ratio
to
degrees
of
kinship
was
a
prospective
disgrace
that
would
have
embittered
her
life
this
had
always
been
a
principle
in
the
dodson
family
it
was
one
form
if
that
sense
of
honor
and
rectitude
which
was
a
proud
tradition
in
such
families
a
tradition
which
has
been
the
salt
of
our
provincial
society
but
though
the
letter
could
not
shake
glegg
principles
it
made
the
family
breach
much
more
difficult
to
mend
and
as
to
the
effect
it
produced
on
glegg
opinion
of
tulliver
she
begged
to
be
understood
from
that
time
forth
that
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
say
about
him
his
state
of
mind
apparently
was
too
corrupt
for
her
to
contemplate
it
for
a
moment
it
was
not
until
the
evening
before
tom
went
to
school
at
the
beginning
of
august
that
glegg
paid
a
visit
to
her
sister
tulliver
sitting
in
her
gig
all
the
while
and
showing
her
displeasure
by
markedly
abstaining
from
all
advice
and
criticism
for
as
she
observed
to
her
sister
deane
bessy
must
bear
the
consequence
o
having
such
a
husband
though
i
sorry
for
her
and
deane
agreed
that
bessy
was
pitiable
that
evening
tom
observed
to
maggie
oh
my
maggie
aunt
beginning
to
come
again
i
glad
i
going
to
school
catch
it
all
now
maggie
was
already
so
full
of
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
tom
going
away
from
her
that
this
playful
exultation
of
his
seemed
very
unkind
and
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
tulliver
prompt
procedure
entailed
on
him
further
promptitude
in
finding
the
convenient
person
who
was
desirous
of
lending
five
hundred
pounds
on
bond
it
must
be
no
client
of
wakem
he
said
to
himself
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
it
turned
out
to
the
contrary
not
because
tulliver
will
was
feeble
but
because
external
fact
was
stronger
wakem
client
was
the
only
convenient
person
to
be
found
tulliver
had
a
destiny
as
well
as
œdipus
and
in
this
case
he
might
plead
like

that
his
deed
was
inflicted

were

had
that
precedence
among

which

him

jacobs
himself
familiarly
known
as
old
goggles
from
his
habit
of
wearing
spectacles
imposed
no
painful
awe

it
was
the

for
his
part

glad
he
was
not
in
danger
of
those
mean
accomplishments
he
was
not
going
to
be
a
snuffy
schoolmaster
he
but
a
substantial
man
like
his
father
who
used
to
go
hunting
when
he
was
younger
and
rode
a
capital
black
mare
as
pretty
a
bit
of
as
ever
you
saw
tom
had
heard
what
her
points
were
a
hundred
times
meant
to
go
hunting
too
and
to
be
generally
respected
when
people
were
grown
up
he
considered
nobody
inquired
about
their
writing
and
spelling
when
he
was
a
man
he
should
be
master
of
everything
and
do
just
as
he
liked
it
had
been
very
difficult
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
that
his
was
to
be
prolonged
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
brought
up
to
his
father
business
which
he
had
always
thought
extremely
pleasant
for
it
was
nothing
but
riding
about
giving
orders
and
going
to
market
and
he
thought
that
a
clergyman
would
give
him
a
great
many
scripture
lessons
and
probably
make
him
learn
the
gospel
and
epistle
on
a
sunday
as
well
as
the
collect
but
in
the
absence
of
specific
information
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
that
school
and
a
schoolmaster
would
be
something
entirely
different
from
the
academy
of
jacobs
so
not
to
be
at
a
deficiency
in
case
of
his
finding
genial
companions
he
had
taken
care
to
carry
with
him
a
small
box
of
not
that
there
was
anything
particular
to
be
done
with
them
but
they
would
serve
to
impress
strange
boys
with
a
sense
of
his
familiarity
with
guns
thus
poor
tom
though
he
saw
very
clearly
through
maggie
illusions
was
not
without
illusions
of
his
own
which
were
to
be
cruelly
dissipated
by
his
enlarged
experience
at
king
lorton
he
had
not
been
there
a
fortnight
before
it
was
evident
to
him
that
life
complicated
not
only
with
the
latin
grammar
but
with
a
new
standard
of
english
pronunciation
was
a
very
difficult
business
made

the
more
obscure
by
a
thick
mist
of
bashfulness
tom
as
you
have
observed
was
never
an
exception
among
boys
for
ease
of
address
but
the
difficulty
of
enunciating
a
monosyllable
in
reply
to
or
stelling
was
so
great
that
he
even
dreaded
to
be
asked
at
table
whether
he
would
have
more
pudding
as
to
the
he
had
almost
resolved
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
that
he
would
throw
them
into
a
neighboring
pond
for
not
only
was
he
the
solitary
pupil
but
he
began
even
to
have
a
certain
scepticism
about
guns
and
a
general
sense
that
his
theory
of
life
was
undermined
for
stelling
thought
nothing
of
guns
or
horses
either
apparently
and
yet
it
was
impossible
for
tom
to
despise
stelling
as
he
had
despised
old
goggles
if
there
were
anything
that
was
not
thoroughly
genuine
about
stelling
it
lay
quite
beyond
tom
power
to
detect
it
it
is
only
by
a
wide
comparison
of
facts
that
the
wisest
man
can
distinguish
barrels
from
mere
supernal
thunder
stelling
was
a
man
not
yet
thirty
with
flaxen
hair
standing
erect
and
large
eyes
which
were
always
very
wide
open
he
had
a
sonorous
bass
voice
and
an
air
of
defiant
inclining
to
brazenness
he
had
entered
on
his
career
with
great
vigor
and
intended
to
make
a
considerable
impression
on
his
fellowmen
the
rev
walter
stelling
was
not
a
man
who
would
remain
among
the
inferior
clergy
all
his
life
he
had
a
true
british
determination
to
push
his
way
in
the
world
as
a
schoolmaster
in
the
first
place
for
there
were
capital
masterships
of
to
be
had
and
stelling
meant
to
have
one
of
them
but
as
a
preacher
also
for
he
meant
always
to
preach
in
a
striking
manner
so
as
to
have
his
congregation
swelled
by
admirers
from
neighboring
parishes
and
to
produce
a
great
sensation
whenever
he
took
occasional
duty
for
a
brother
clergyman
of
minor
gifts
the
style
of
preaching
he
had
chosen
was
the
extemporaneous
which
was
held
little
short
of
the
miraculous
in
rural
parishes
like
lorton
some
passages
of
massillon
and
bourdaloue
which
he
knew
by
heart
were
really
very
effective
when
rolled
out
in
deepest
tones
but
as
comparatively
feeble
appeals
of
his
own
were
delivered
in
the
same
loud
and
impressive
manner
they
were
often
thought
quite
as
striking
by
his
hearers
stelling
doctrine
was
of
no
particular
school
if
anything
it
had
a
tinge
of
evangelicalism
for
that
was
the
telling
thing
just
then
in
the
diocese
to
which
king
lorton
belonged
in
short
stelling
was
a
man
who
meant
to
rise
in
his
profession
and
to
rise
by
merit
clearly
since
he
had
no
interest
beyond
what
might
be
promised
by
a
problematic
relationship
to
a
great
lawyer
who
had
not
yet
become
lord
chancellor
a
clergyman
who
has
such
vigorous
intentions
naturally
gets
a
little
into
debt
at
starting
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
he
will
live
in
the
meagre
style
of
a
man
who
means
to
be
a
poor
curate
all
his
life
and
if
the
few
hundreds
timpson
advanced
toward
his
daughter
fortune
did
not
suffice
for
the
purchase
of
handsome
furniture
together
with
a
stock
of
wine
a
grand
piano
and
the
laying
out
of
a
superior
it
followed
in
the
most
rigorous
manner
either
that
these
things
must
be
procured
by
some
other
means
or
else
that
the
rev
stelling
must
go
without
them
which
last
alternative
would
be
an
absurd
procrastination
of
the
fruits
of
success
where
success
was
certain
stelling
was
so
and
resolute
that
he
felt
equal
to
anything
he
would
become
celebrated
by
shaking
the
consciences
of
his
hearers
and
he
would
by
and
by
edit
a
greek
play
and
invent
several
new
readings
he
had
not
yet
selected
the
play
for
having
been
married
little
more
than
two
years
his
leisure
time
had
been
much
occupied
with
attentions
to
stelling
but
he
had
told
that
fine
woman
what
he
meant
to
do
some
day
and
she
felt
great
confidence
in
her
husband
as
a
man
who
understood
everything
of
that
sort
but
the
immediate
step
to
future
success
was
to
bring
on
tom
tulliver
during
this
first
for
by
a
singular
coincidence
there
had
been
some
negotiation
concerning
another
pupil
from
the
same
neighborhood
and
it
might
further
a
decision
in
stelling
favor
if
it
were
understood
that
young
tulliver
who
stelling
observed
in
conjugal
privacy
was
rather
a
rough
cub
had
made
prodigious
progress
in
a
short
time
it
was
on
this
ground
that
he
was
severe
with
tom
about
his
lessons
he
was
clearly
a
boy
whose
powers
would
never
be
developed
through
the
medium
of
the
latin
grammar
without
the
application
of
some
sternness
not
that
stelling
was
a
or
unkind
man
quite
the
contrary
he
was
jocose
with
tom
at
table
and
corrected
his
provincialisms
and
his
deportment
in
the
most
playful
manner
but
poor
tom
was
only
the
more
cowed
and
confused
by
this
double
novelty
for
he
had
never
been
used
to
jokes
at
all
like
stelling
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
a
painful
sense
that
he
was
all
wrong
somehow
when
stelling
said
as
the
was
being
uncovered
now
tulliver
which
would
you
rather
decline
or
the
latin
for
it
tom
to
whom
in
his
coolest
moments
a
pun
would
have
been
a
hard
nut
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
embarrassed
alarm
that
made
everything
dim
to
him
except
the
feeling
that
he
would
rather
not
have
anything
to
do
with
latin
of
course
he
answered
whereupon
there
followed
much
laughter
and
some
practical
joking
with
the
plates
from
which
tom
gathered
that
he
had
in
some
mysterious
way
refused
beef
and
in
fact
made
himself
appear
a
silly
if
he
could
have
seen
a
undergo
these
painful
operations
and
survive
them
in
good
spirits
he
might
sooner
have
taken
them
as
a
matter
of
course
but
there
are
two
expensive
forms
of
education
either
of
which
a
parent
may
procure
for
his
son
by
sending
him
as
solitary
pupil
to
a
clergyman
one
is
the
enjoyment
of
the
reverend
gentleman
undivided
neglect
the
other
is
the
endurance
of
the
reverend
undivided
attention
it
was
the
latter
privilege
for
which
tulliver
paid
a
high
price
in
tom
initiatory
months
at
lorton
that
respectable
miller
and
maltster
had
left
tom
behind
and
driven
homeward
in
a
state
of
great
mental
satisfaction
he
considered
that
it
was
a
happy
moment
for
him
when
he
had
thought
of
asking
advice
about
a
tutor
for
tom
stelling
eyes
were
so
wide
open
and
he
talked
in
such
an
way
answering
every
difficult
slow
remark
of
tulliver
with
i
see
my
good
sir
i
see
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
you
want
your
son
to
be
a
man
who
will
make
his
way
in
the
world
that
tulliver
was
delighted
to
find
in
him
a
clergyman
whose
knowledge
was
so
applicable
to
the
affairs
of
this
life
except
counsellor
wylde
whom
he
had
heard
at
the
last
sessions
tulliver
thought
the
rev
mr
stelling
was
the
shrewdest
fellow
he
had
ever
met
with
not
unlike
wylde
in
fact
he
had
the
same
way
of
sticking
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
tulliver
was
not
by
any
means
an
exception
in
mistaking
brazenness
for
shrewdness
most
laymen
thought
stelling
shrewd
and
a
man
of
remarkable
powers
generally
it
was
chiefly
by
his
clerical
brethren
that
he
was
considered
rather
a
full
fellow
but
he
told
tulliver
several
stories
about
swing
and
incendiarism
and
asked
his
advice
about
feeding
pigs
in
so
thoroughly
secular
and
judicious
a
manner
with
so
much
polished
glibness
of
tongue
that
the
miller
thought
here
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
for
tom
he
had
no
doubt
this
man
was
acquainted
with
every
branch
of
information
and
knew
exactly
what
tom
must
learn
in
order
to
become
a
match
for
the
lawyers
which
poor
tulliver
himself
did
know
and
so
was
necessarily
thrown
for
on
this
wide
kind
of
inference
it
is
hardly
fair
to
laugh
at
him
for
i
have
known
much
more
highly
instructed
persons
than
he
make
inferences
quite
as
wide
and
not
at
all
wiser
as
for
tulliver
finding
that
stelling
views
as
to
the
airing
of
linen
and
the
frequent
recurrence
of
hunger
in
a
growing
boy
entirely
coincided
with
her
own
moreover
that
stelling
though
so
young
a
woman
and
only
anticipating
her
second
confinement
had
gone
through
very
nearly
the
same
experience
as
herself
with
regard
to
the
behavior
and
fundamental
character
of
the
monthly
nurse
she
expressed
great
contentment
to
her
husband
when
they
drove
away
at
leaving
tom
with
a
woman
who
in
spite
of
her
youth
seemed
quite
sensible
and
motherly
and
asked
advice
as
prettily
as
could
be
they
must
be
very
well
off
though
said
tulliver
for
everything
as
nice
as
can
be
all
over
the
house
and
that
watered
silk
she
had
on
cost
a
pretty
penny
sister
pullet
has
got
one
like
it
ah
said
tulliver
he
got
some
income
besides
the
curacy
i
reckon
perhaps
her
father
allows
something
there
tom
be
another
hundred
to
him
and
not
much
trouble
either
by
his
own
account
he
says
teaching
comes
natural
to
him
that
wonderful
now
added
tulliver
turning
his
head
on
one
side
and
giving
his
horse
a
meditative
tickling
on
the
flank
perhaps
it
was
because
teaching
came
naturally
to
stelling
that
he
set
about
it
with
that
uniformity
of
method
and
independence
of
circumstances
which
distinguish
the
actions
of
animals
understood
to
be
under
the
immediate
teaching
of
nature
broderip
amiable
beaver
as
that
charming
naturalist
tells
us
busied
himself
as
earnestly
in
constructing
a
dam
in
a
room
up
three
pair
of
stairs
in
london
as
if
he
had
been
laying
his
foundation
in
a
stream
or
lake
in
upper
canada
it
was
binny
function
to
build
the
absence
of
water
or
of
possible
progeny
was
an
accident
for
which
he
was
not
accountable
with
the
same
unerring
instinct
stelling
set
to
work
at
his
natural
method
of
instilling
the
eton
grammar
and
euclid
into
the
mind
of
tom
tulliver
this
he
considered
was
the
only
basis
of
solid
instruction
all
other
means
of
education
were
mere
charlatanism
and
could
produce
nothing
better
than
smatterers
fixed
on
this
firm
basis
a
man
might
observe
the
display
of
various
or
special
knowledge
made
by
irregularly
educated
people
with
a
pitying
smile
all
that
sort
of
thing
was
very
well
but
it
was
impossible
these
people
could
form
sound
opinions
in
holding
this
conviction
stelling
was
not
biassed
as
some
tutors
have
been
by
the
excessive
accuracy
or
extent
of
his
own
scholarship
and
as
to
his
views
about
euclid
no
opinion
could
have
been
freer
from
personal
partiality
stelling
was
very
far
from
being
led
astray
by
enthusiasm
either
religious
or
intellectual
on
the
other
hand
he
had
no
secret
belief
that
everything
was
humbug
he
thought
religion
was
a
very
excellent
thing
and
aristotle
a
great
authority
and
deaneries
and
prebends
useful
institutions
and
great
britain
the
providential
bulwark
of
protestantism
and
faith
in
the
unseen
a
great
support
to
afflicted
minds
he
believed
in
all
these
things
as
a
swiss
believes
in
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
around
him
and
in
the
pleasure
it
gives
to
artistic
visitors
and
in
the
same
way
stelling
believed
in
his
method
of
education
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
doing
the
very
best
thing
for
tulliver
boy
of
course
when
the
miller
talked
of
mapping
and
summing
in
a
vague
and
diffident
manner
mr
stelling
had
set
his
mind
at
rest
by
an
assurance
that
he
understood
what
was
wanted
for
how
was
it
possible
the
good
man
could
form
any
reasonable
judgment
about
the
matter
mr
stelling
duty
was
to
teach
the
lad
in
the
only
right
way
indeed
he
knew
no
other
he
had
not
wasted
his
time
in
the
acquirement
of
anything
abnormal
he
very
soon
set
down
poor
tom
as
a
thoroughly
stupid
lad
for
though
by
hard
labor
he
could
get
particular
declensions
into
his
brain
anything
so
abstract
as
the
relation
between
cases
and
terminations
could
by
no
means
get
such
a
lodgment
there
as
to
enable
him
to
recognize
a
chance
genitive
or
dative
this
struck
stelling
as
something
more
than
natural
stupidity
he
suspected
obstinacy
or
at
any
rate
indifference
and
lectured
tom
severely
on
his
want
of
thorough
application
you
feel
no
interest
in
what
you
doing
sir
stelling
would
say
and
the
reproach
was
painfully
true
tom
had
never
found
any
difficulty
in
discerning
a
pointer
from
a
setter
when
once
he
had
been
told
the
distinction
and
his
perceptive
powers
were
not
at
all
deficient
i
fancy
they
were
quite
as
strong
as
those
of
the
rev
stelling
for
tom
could
predict
with
accuracy
what
number
of
horses
were
cantering
behind
him
he
could
throw
a
stone
right
into
the
centre
of
a
given
ripple
he
could
guess
to
a
fraction
how
many
lengths
of
his
stick
it
would
take
to
reach
across
the
playground
and
could
draw
almost
perfect
squares
on
his
slate
without
any
measurement
but
stelling
took
no
note
of
these
things
he
only
observed
that
tom
faculties
failed
him
before
the
abstractions
hideously
symbolized
to
him
in
the
pages
of
the
eton
grammar
and
that
he
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
idiocy
with
regard
to
the
demonstration
that
two
given
triangles
must
be
equal
though
he
could
discern
with
great
promptitude
and
certainty
the
fact
that
they
equal
whence
stelling
concluded
that
tom
brain
being
peculiarly
impervious
to
etymology
and
demonstrations
was
peculiarly
in
need
of
being
ploughed
and
harrowed
by
these
patent
implements
it
was
his
favorite
metaphor
that
the
classics
and
geometry
constituted
that
culture
of
the
mind
which
prepared
it
for
the
reception
of
any
subsequent
crop
i
say
nothing
against
stelling
theory
if
we
are
to
have
one
regimen
for
all
minds
his
seems
to
me
as
good
as
any
other
i
only
know
it
turned
out
as
uncomfortably
for
tom
tulliver
as
if
he
had
been
plied
with
cheese
in
order
to
remedy
a
gastric
weakness
which
prevented
him
from
digesting
it
it
is
astonishing
what
a
different
result
one
gets
by
changing
the
metaphor
once
call
the
brain
an
intellectual
stomach
and
one
ingenious
conception
of
the
classics
and
geometry
as
ploughs
and
harrows
seems
to
settle
nothing
but
then
it
is
open
to
some
one
else
to
follow
great
authorities
and
call
the
mind
a
sheet
of
white
paper
or
a
mirror
in
which
case
knowledge
of
the
digestive
process
becomes
quite
irrelevant
it
was
doubtless
an
ingenious
idea
to
call
the
camel
the
ship
of
the
desert
but
it
would
hardly
lead
one
far
in
training
that
useful
beast
o
aristotle
if
you
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
the
freshest
modern
instead
of
the
greatest
ancient
would
you
not
have
mingled
your
praise
of
metaphorical
speech
as
a
sign
of
high
intelligence
with
a
lamentation
that
intelligence
so
rarely
shows
itself
in
speech
without
metaphor
that
we
can
so
seldom
declare
what
a
thing
is
except
by
saying
it
is
something
else
tom
tulliver
being
abundant
in
no
form
of
speech
did
not
use
any
metaphor
to
declare
his
views
as
to
the
nature
of
latin
he
never
called
it
an
instrument
of
torture
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
got
on
some
way
in
the
next
and
in
the
delectus
that
he
was
advanced
enough
to
call
it
a
bore
and
beastly
stuff
at
present
in
relation
to
this
demand
that
he
should
learn
latin
declensions
and
conjugations
tom
was
in
a
state
of
as
blank
unimaginativeness
concerning
the
cause
and
tendency
of
his
sufferings
as
if
he
had
been
an
innocent
shrewmouse
imprisoned
in
the
split
trunk
of
an
in
order
to
cure
lameness
in
cattle
it
is
doubtless
almost
incredible
to
instructed
minds
of
the
present
day
that
a
boy
of
twelve
not
belonging
strictly
to
the
masses
who
are
now
understood
to
have
the
monopoly
of
mental
darkness
should
have
had
no
distinct
idea
how
there
came
to
be
such
a
thing
as
latin
on
this
earth
yet
so
it
was
with
tom
it
would
have
taken
a
long
while
to
make
conceivable
to
him
that
there
ever
existed
a
people
who
bought
and
sold
sheep
and
oxen
and
transacted
the
affairs
of
life
through
the
medium
of
this
language
and
still
longer
to
make
him
understand
why
he
should
be
called
upon
to
learn
it
when
its
connection
with
those
affairs
had
become
entirely
latent
so
far
as
tom
had
gained
any
acquaintance
with
the
romans
at
jacob
academy
his
knowledge
was
strictly
correct
but
it
went
no
farther
than
the
fact
that
they
were
in
the
new
testament
and
stelling
was
not
the
man
to
enfeeble
and
emasculate
his
pupil
mind
by
simplifying
and
explaining
or
to
reduce
the
tonic
effect
of
etymology
by
mixing
it
with
smattering
extraneous
information
such
as
is
given
to
girls
yet
strange
to
say
under
this
vigorous
treatment
tom
became
more
like
a
girl
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
he
had
a
large
share
of
pride
which
had
hitherto
found
itself
very
comfortable
in
the
world
despising
old
goggles
and
reposing
in
the
sense
of
unquestioned
rights
but
now
this
same
pride
met
with
nothing
but
bruises
and
crushings
tom
was
too
not
to
be
aware
that
stelling
standard
of
things
was
quite
different
was
certainly
something
higher
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
than
that
of
the
people
he
had
been
living
amongst
and
that
brought
in
contact
with
it
he
tom
tulliver
appeared
uncouth
and
stupid
he
was
by
no
means
indifferent
to
this
and
his
pride
got
into
an
uneasy
condition
which
quite
nullified
his
boyish
and
gave
him
something
of
the
girl
susceptibility
he
was
a
very
firm
not
to
say
obstinate
disposition
but
there
was
no
rebellion
and
recklessness
in
his
nature
the
human
sensibilities
predominated
and
if
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
enable
himself
to
show
some
quickness
at
his
lessons
and
so
acquire
stelling
approbation
by
standing
on
one
leg
for
an
inconvenient
length
of
time
or
rapping
his
head
moderately
against
the
wall
or
any
voluntary
action
of
that
sort
he
would
certainly
have
tried
it
but
no
tom
had
never
heard
that
these
measures
would
brighten
the
understanding
or
strengthen
the
verbal
memory
and
he
was
not
given
to
hypothesis
and
experiment
it
did
occur
to
him
that
he
could
perhaps
get
some
help
by
praying
for
it
but
as
the
prayers
he
said
every
evening
were
forms
learned
by
heart
he
rather
shrank
from
the
novelty
and
irregularity
of
introducing
an
extempore
passage
on
a
topic
of
petition
for
which
he
was
not
aware
of
any
precedent
but
one
day
when
he
had
broken
down
for
the
fifth
time
in
the
supines
of
the
third
conjugation
and
stelling
convinced
that
this
must
be
carelessness
since
it
transcended
the
bounds
of
possible
stupidity
had
lectured
him
very
seriously
pointing
out
that
if
he
failed
to
seize
the
present
golden
opportunity
of
learning
supines
he
would
have
to
regret
it
when
he
became
a
man
tom
more
miserable
than
usual
determined
to
try
his
sole
resource
and
that
evening
after
his
usual
form
of
prayer
for
his
parents
and
little
sister
he
had
begun
to
pray
for
maggie
when
she
was
a
baby
and
that
he
might
be
able
always
to
keep
commandments
he
added
in
the
same
low
whisper
and
please
to
make
me
always
remember
my
latin
he
paused
a
little
to
consider
how
he
should
pray
about
euclid
whether
he
should
ask
to
see
what
it
meant
or
whether
there
was
any
other
mental
state
which
would
be
more
applicable
to
the
case
but
at
last
he
added
and
make
stelling
say
i
do
euclid
any
more
amen
the
fact
that
he
got
through
his
supines
without
mistake
the
next
day
encouraged
him
to
persevere
in
this
appendix
to
his
prayers
and
neutralized
any
scepticism
that
might
have
arisen
from
continued
demand
for
euclid
but
his
faith
broke
down
under
the
apparent
absence
of
all
help
when
he
got
into
the
irregular
verbs
it
seemed
clear
that
tom
despair
under
the
caprices
of
the
present
tense
did
not
constitute
a
worthy
of
interference
and
since
this
was
the
climax
of
his
difficulties
where
was
the
use
of
praying
for
help
any
longer
he
made
up
his
mind
to
this
conclusion
in
one
of
his
dull
lonely
evenings
which
he
spent
in
the
study
preparing
his
lessons
for
the
morrow
his
eyes
were
apt
to
get
dim
over
the
page
though
he
hated
crying
and
was
ashamed
of
it
he
could
help
thinking
with
some
affection
even
of
spouncer
whom
he
used
to
fight
and
quarrel
with
he
would
have
felt
at
home
with
spouncer
and
in
a
condition
of
superiority
and
then
the
mill
and
the
river
and
yap
pricking
up
his
ears
ready
to
obey
the
least
sign
when
tom
said
hoigh
would
all
come
before
him
in
a
sort
of
calenture
when
his
fingers
played
absently
in
his
pocket
with
his
great
knife
and
his
coil
of
whipcord
and
other
relics
of
the
past
tom
as
i
said
had
never
been
so
much
like
a
girl
in
his
life
before
and
at
that
epoch
of
irregular
verbs
his
spirit
was
further
depressed
by
a
new
means
of
mental
development
which
had
been
thought
of
for
him
out
of
school
hours
stelling
had
lately
had
her
second
baby
and
as
nothing
could
be
more
salutary
for
a
boy
than
to
feel
himself
useful
stelling
considered
she
was
doing
tom
a
service
by
setting
him
to
watch
the
little
cherub
laura
while
the
nurse
was
occupied
with
the
sickly
baby
it
was
quite
a
pretty
employment
for
tom
to
take
little
laura
out
in
the
sunniest
hour
of
the
autumn
day
it
would
help
to
make
him
feel
that
lorton
parsonage
was
a
home
for
him
and
that
he
was
one
of
the
family
the
little
cherub
laura
not
being
an
accomplished
walker
at
present
had
a
ribbon
fastened
round
her
waist
by
which
tom
held
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
dog
during
the
minutes
in
which
she
chose
to
walk
but
as
these
were
rare
he
was
for
the
most
part
carrying
this
fine
child
round
and
round
the
garden
within
sight
of
stelling
window
according
to
orders
if
any
one
considers
this
unfair
and
even
oppressive
toward
tom
i
beg
him
to
consider
that
there
are
feminine
virtues
which
are
with
difficulty
combined
even
if
they
are
not
incompatible
when
the
wife
of
a
poor
curate
contrives
under
all
her
disadvantages
to
dress
extremely
well
and
to
have
a
style
of
coiffure
which
requires
that
her
nurse
shall
occasionally
officiate
as
when
moreover
her
and
her
show
that
effort
at
elegance
and
completeness
of
appointment
to
which
ordinary
women
might
imagine
a
large
income
necessary
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
of
her
that
she
should
employ
a
second
nurse
or
even
act
as
a
nurse
herself
stelling
knew
better
he
saw
that
his
wife
did
wonders
already
and
was
proud
of
her
it
was
certainly
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
young
tulliver
gait
to
carry
a
heavy
child
but
he
had
plenty
of
exercise
in
long
walks
with
himself
and
next
stelling
would
see
about
having
a
among
the
many
means
whereby
stelling
intended
to
be
more
fortunate
than
the
bulk
of
his
he
had
entirely
given
up
that
of
having
his
own
way
in
his
own
house
what
then
he
had
married
as
kind
a
little
soul
as
ever
breathed
according
to
riley
who
had
been
acquainted
with
stelling
blond
ringlets
and
smiling
demeanor
throughout
her
maiden
life
and
on
the
strength
of
that
knowledge
would
have
been
ready
any
day
to
pronounce
that
whatever
domestic
differences
might
arise
in
her
married
life
must
be
entirely
stelling
fault
if
tom
had
had
a
worse
disposition
he
would
certainly
have
hated
the
little
cherub
laura
but
he
was
too
a
lad
for
that
there
was
too
much
in
him
of
the
fibre
that
turns
to
true
manliness
and
to
protecting
pity
for
the
weak
i
am
afraid
he
hated
stelling
and
contracted
a
lasting
dislike
to
pale
blond
ringlets
and
broad
plaits
as
directly
associated
with
haughtiness
of
manner
and
a
frequent
reference
to
other
people
duty
but
he
could
help
playing
with
little
laura
and
liking
to
amuse
her
he
even
sacrificed
his
for
her
sake
in
despair
of
their
ever
serving
a
greater
purpose
thinking
the
small
flash
and
bang
would
delight
her
and
thereby
drawing
down
on
himself
a
rebuke
from
stelling
for
teaching
her
child
to
play
with
fire
laura
was
a
sort
of
playfellow
and
oh
how
tom
longed
for
playfellows
in
his
secret
heart
he
yearned
to
have
maggie
with
him
and
was
almost
ready
to
dote
on
her
exasperating
acts
of
forgetfulness
though
when
he
was
at
home
he
always
represented
it
as
a
great
favor
on
his
part
to
let
maggie
trot
by
his
side
on
his
pleasure
excursions
and
before
this
dreary
was
ended
maggie
actually
came
stelling
had
given
a
general
invitation
for
the
little
girl
to
come
and
stay
with
her
brother
so
when
tulliver
drove
over
to
lorton
late
in
october
maggie
came
too
with
the
sense
that
she
was
taking
a
great
journey
and
beginning
to
see
the
world
it
was
tulliver
first
visit
to
see
tom
for
the
lad
must
learn
not
to
think
too
much
about
home
well
my
lad
he
said
to
tom
when
stelling
had
left
the
room
to
announce
the
arrival
to
his
wife
and
maggie
had
begun
to
kiss
tom
freely
you
look
rarely
school
agrees
with
you
tom
wished
he
had
looked
rather
i
do
think
i
well
father
said
tom
i
wish
you
ask
stelling
not
to
let
me
do
euclid
it
brings
on
the
toothache
i
think
the
toothache
was
the
only
malady
to
which
tom
had
ever
been
subject
euclid
my
lad
why
what
that
said
tulliver
oh
i
do
know
it
definitions
and
axioms
and
triangles
and
things
it
a
book
i
got
to
learn
in
there
no
sense
in
it
go
go
said
tulliver
reprovingly
you
must
say
so
you
must
learn
what
your
master
tells
you
he
knows
what
it
right
for
you
to
learn
help
you
now
tom
said
maggie
with
a
little
air
of
patronizing
consolation
i
come
to
stay
ever
so
long
if
stelling
asks
me
i
brought
my
box
and
my
pinafores
have
i
father
help
me
you
silly
little
thing
said
tom
in
such
high
spirits
at
this
announcement
that
he
quite
enjoyed
the
idea
of
confounding
maggie
by
showing
her
a
page
of
euclid
i
should
like
to
see
you
doing
one
of
lessons
why
i
learn
latin
too
girls
never
learn
such
things
they
too
silly
i
know
what
latin
is
very
well
said
maggie
confidently
latin
a
language
there
are
latin
words
in
the
dictionary
there
bonus
a
gift
now
you
just
wrong
there
miss
maggie
said
tom
secretly
astonished
you
think
you
very
wise
but
means
as
it
happens
bonus
bona
bonum
well
that
no
reason
why
it
should
mean
said
maggie
stoutly
it
may
mean
several
things
almost
every
word
does
it
means
the
as
well
as
the
stuff
are
made
of
well
done
little
said
tulliver
laughing
while
tom
felt
rather
disgusted
with
maggie
knowingness
though
beyond
measure
cheerful
at
the
thought
that
she
was
going
to
stay
with
him
her
conceit
would
soon
be
overawed
by
the
actual
inspection
of
his
books
stelling
in
her
pressing
invitation
did
not
mention
a
longer
time
than
a
week
for
maggie
stay
but
stelling
who
took
her
between
his
knees
and
asked
her
where
she
stole
her
dark
eyes
from
insisted
that
she
must
stay
a
fortnight
maggie
thought
stelling
was
a
charming
man
and
tulliver
was
quite
proud
to
leave
his
little
wench
where
she
would
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
her
cleverness
to
appreciating
strangers
so
it
was
agreed
that
she
should
not
be
fetched
home
till
the
end
of
the
fortnight
now
then
come
with
me
into
the
study
maggie
said
tom
as
their
father
drove
away
what
do
you
shake
and
toss
your
head
now
for
you
silly
he
continued
for
though
her
hair
was
now
under
a
new
dispensation
and
was
brushed
smoothly
behind
her
ears
she
seemed
still
in
imagination
to
be
tossing
it
out
of
her
eyes
it
makes
you
look
as
if
you
were
crazy
oh
i
ca
help
it
said
maggie
impatiently
do
tease
me
tom
oh
what
books
she
exclaimed
as
she
saw
the
bookcases
in
the
study
how
i
should
like
to
have
as
many
books
as
that
why
you
could
read
one
of
said
tom
triumphantly
all
latin
no
they
are
said
maggie
i
can
read
the
back
of
this
of
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
well
what
does
that
mean
do
know
said
tom
wagging
his
head
but
i
could
soon
find
out
said
maggie
scornfully
why
how
i
should
look
inside
and
see
what
it
was
about
you
better
not
miss
maggie
said
tom
seeing
her
hand
on
the
volume
stelling
lets
nobody
touch
his
books
without
leave
and
shall
catch
it
if
you
take
it
out
oh
very
well
let
me
see
all
books
then
said
maggie
turning
to
throw
her
arms
round
tom
neck
and
rub
his
cheek
with
her
small
round
nose
tom
in
the
gladness
of
his
heart
at
having
dear
old
maggie
to
dispute
with
and
crow
over
again
seized
her
round
the
waist
and
began
to
jump
with
her
round
the
large
library
table
away
they
jumped
with
more
and
more
vigor
till
maggie
hair
flew
from
behind
her
ears
and
twirled
about
like
an
animated
mop
but
the
revolutions
round
the
table
became
more
and
more
irregular
in
their
sweep
till
at
last
reaching
stelling
reading
stand
they
sent
it
thundering
down
with
its
heavy
lexicons
to
the
floor
happily
it
was
the
and
the
study
was
a
wing
to
the
house
so
that
the
downfall
made
no
alarming
resonance
though
tom
stood
dizzy
and
aghast
for
a
few
minutes
dreading
the
appearance
of
or
stelling
oh
i
say
maggie
said
tom
at
last
lifting
up
the
stand
we
must
keep
quiet
here
you
know
if
we
break
anything
stelling
make
us
cry
peccavi
what
that
said
maggie
oh
it
the
latin
for
a
good
scolding
said
tom
not
without
some
pride
in
his
knowledge
is
she
a
cross
woman
said
maggie
i
believe
you
said
tom
with
an
emphatic
nod
i
think
all
women
are
crosser
than
men
said
maggie
aunt
glegg
a
great
deal
crosser
than
uncle
glegg
and
mother
scolds
me
more
than
father
does
well
be
a
woman
some
day
said
tom
so
talk
but
i
shall
be
a
woman

maggie
with
a
toss
oh

say

a
nasty
conceited
thing

you
but
you
ought
to
hate
me
tom

tom
oh
bother
never
mind
come
it
time
for
me
to
learn
my
lessons
see
here
what
i
got
to
do
said
tom
drawing
maggie
toward
him
and
showing
her
his
theorem
while
she
pushed
her
hair
behind
her
ears
and
prepared
herself
to
prove
her
capability
of
helping
him
in
euclid
she
began
to
read
with
full
confidence
in
her
own
powers
but
presently
becoming
quite
bewildered
her
face
flushed
with
irritation
it
was
unavoidable
she
must
confess
her
incompetency
and
she
was
not
fond
of
humiliation
it
nonsense
she
said
and
very
ugly
stuff
nobody
need
want
to
make
it
out
ah
there
now
miss
maggie
said
tom
drawing
the
book
away
and
wagging
his
head
at
her
you
see
you
not
so
clever
as
you
thought
you
were
oh
said
maggie
pouting
i
dare
say
i
could
make
it
out
if
learned
what
goes
before
as
you
have
but
that
what
you
just
could
miss
wisdom
said
tom
for
all
the
harder
when
you
know
what
goes
before
for
then
you
got
to
say
what
definition
is
and
what
axiom
is
but
get
along
with
you
now
i
must
go
on
with
this
here
the
latin
grammar
see
what
you
can
make
of
that
maggie
found
the
latin
grammar
quite
soothing
after
her
mathematical
mortification
for
she
delighted
in
new
words
and
quickly
found
that
there
was
an
english
key
at
the
end
which
would
make
her
very
wise
about
latin
at
slight
expense
she
presently
made
up
her
mind
to
skip
the
rules
in
the
syntax
the
examples
became
so
absorbing
these
mysterious
sentences
snatched
from
an
unknown
context
like
strange
horns
of
beasts
and
leaves
of
unknown
plants
brought
from
some
region
gave
boundless
scope
to
her
imagination
and
were
all
the
more
fascinating
because
they
were
in
a
peculiar
tongue
of
their
own
which
she
could
learn
to
interpret
it
was
really
very
interesting
the
latin
grammar
that
tom
had
said
no
girls
could
learn
and
she
was
proud
because
she
found
it
interesting
the
most
fragmentary
examples
were
her
favourites
omnibus
est
would
have
been
jejune
only
she
liked
to
know
the
latin
but
the
fortunate
gentleman
whom
every
one
congratulated
because
he
had
a
son
endowed
with
a
disposition
afforded
her
a
great
deal
of
pleasant
conjecture
and
she
was
quite
lost
in
the
thick
grove
penetrable
by
no
star
when
tom
called
out
now
then
magsie
give
us
the
grammar
oh
tom
it
such
a
pretty
book
she
said
as
she
jumped
out
of
the
large
to
give
it
him
it
much
prettier
than
the
dictionary
i
could
learn
latin
very
soon
i
do
think
it
at
all
hard
oh
i
know
what
you
been
doing
said
tom
you
been
reading
the
english
at
the
end
any
donkey
can
do
that
tom
seized
the
book
and
opened
it
with
a
determined
and
air
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
had
a
lesson
to
learn
which
no
donkeys
would
find
themselves
equal
to
maggie
rather
piqued
turned
to
the
bookcases
to
amuse
herself
with
puzzling
out
the
titles
presently
tom
called
to
her
here
magsie
come
and
hear
if
i
can
say
this
stand
at
that
end
of
the
table
where
stelling
sits
when
he
hears
me
maggie
obeyed
and
took
the
open
book
where
do
you
begin
tom
oh
i
begin
at
arborum
because
i
say
all
over
again
what
i
been
learning
this
week
tom
sailed
along
pretty
well
for
three
lines
and
maggie
was
beginning
to
forget
her
office
of
prompter
in
speculating
as
to
what
could
mean
which
came
twice
over
when
he
stuck
fast
at
etiam
do
tell
me
maggie
etiam
etiam
ostrea
no
said
maggie
opening
her
mouth
and
shaking
her
head
etiam
said
tom
very
slowly
as
if
the
next
words
might
be
expected
to
come
sooner
when
he
gave
them
this
strong
hint
that
they
were
waited
for
c
e
u
said
maggie
getting
impatient
oh
i
know
hold
your
tongue
said
tom
passer
hirundo
tom
took
his
pencil
and
made
several
hard
dots
with
it
on
his
oh
dear
oh
dear
tom
said
maggie
what
a
time
you
are
no
no
said
maggie
oh
yes
now
i
can
do
said
tom
it
was
forgotten
tigris
volupes
et
with
some
further
stammering
and
repetition
tom
got
through
the
next
few
lines
now
then
he
said
the
next
is
what
i
just
learned
for
give
me
hold
of
the
book
a
minute
after
some
whispered
gabbling
assisted
by
the
beating
of
his
fist
on
the
table
tom
returned
the
book
nomina
in
he
began
no
tom
said
maggie
that
does
come
next
it
non
creskens
genittivo
exclaimed
tom
with
a
derisive
laugh
for
tom
had
learned
this
omitted
passage
for
his
yesterday
lesson
and
a
young
gentleman
does
not
require
an
intimate
or
extensive
acquaintance
with
latin
before
he
can
feel
the
pitiable
absurdity
of
a
false
quantity
genittivo
what
a
little
silly
you
are
maggie
well
you
need
laugh
tom
for
you
did
remember
it
at
all
sure
it
spelt
so
how
was
i
to
know
i
told
you
girls
could
learn
latin
it
non
crescens
very
well
then
said
maggie
pouting
i
can
say
that
as
well
as
you
can
and
you
do
mind
your
stops
for
you
ought
to
stop
twice
as
long
at
a
semicolon
as
you
do
at
a
comma
and
you
make
the
longest
stops
where
there
ought
to
be
no
stop
at
all
oh
well
do
chatter
let
me
go
on
they
were
presently
fetched
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
the
and
maggie
became
so
animated
with
stelling
who
she
felt
sure
admired
her
cleverness
that
tom
was
rather
amazed
and
alarmed
at
her
audacity
but
she
was
suddenly
subdued
by
stelling
alluding
to
a
little
girl
of
whom
he
had
heard
that
she
once
ran
away
to
the
gypsies
what
a
very
odd
little
girl
that
must
be
said
stelling
meaning
to
be
playful
but
a
playfulness
that
turned
on
her
supposed
oddity
was
not
at
all
to
maggie
taste
she
feared
that
stelling
after
all
did
not
think
much
of
her
and
went
to
bed
in
rather
low
spirits
stelling
she
felt
looked
at
her
as
if
she
thought
her
hair
was
very
ugly
because
it
hung
down
straight
behind
nevertheless
it
was
a
very
happy
fortnight
to
maggie
this
visit
to
tom
she
was
allowed
to
be
in
the
study
while
he
had
his
lessons
and
in
her
various
readings
got
very
deep
into
the
examples
in
the
latin
grammar
the
astronomer
who
hated
women
generally
caused
her
so
much
puzzling
speculation
that
she
one
day
asked
stelling
if
all
astronomers
hated
women
or
whether
it
was
only
this
particular
astronomer
but
forestalling
his
answer
she
said
i
suppose
it
all
astronomers
because
you
know
they
live
up
in
high
towers
and
if
the
women
came
there
they
might
talk
and
hinder
them
from
looking
at
the
stars
stelling
liked
her
prattle
immensely
and
they
were
on
the
best
terms
she
told
tom
she
should
like
to
go
to
school
to
stelling
as
he
did
and
learn
just
the
same
things
she
knew
she
could
do
euclid
for
she
had
looked
into
it
again
and
she
saw
what
a
b
c
meant
they
were
the
names
of
the
lines
i
sure
you
could
do
it
now
said
tom
and
i
just
ask
stelling
if
you
could
i
do
mind
said
the
little
conceited
minx
i
ask
him
myself
stelling
she
said
that
same
evening
when
they
were
in
the
could
i
do
euclid
and
all
tom
lessons
if
you
were
to
teach
me
instead
of
him
no
you
could
said
tom
indignantly
girls
ca
do
euclid
can
they
sir
they
can
pick
up
a
little
of
everything
i
dare
say
said
stelling
they
a
great
deal
of
superficial
cleverness
but
they
could
go
far
into
anything
they
quick
and
shallow
tom
delighted
with
this
verdict
telegraphed
his
triumph
by
wagging
his
head
at
maggie
behind
stelling
chair
as
for
maggie
she
had
hardly
ever
been
so
mortified
she
had
been
so
proud
to
be
called
quick
all
her
little
life
and
now
it
appeared
that
this
quickness
was
the
brand
of
inferiority
it
would
have
been
better
to
be
slow
like
tom
ha
ha
miss
maggie
said
tom
when
they
were
alone
you
see
not
such
a
fine
thing
to
be
quick
you
never
go
far
into
anything
you
know
and
maggie
was
so
oppressed
by
this
dreadful
destiny
that
she
had
no
spirit
for
a
retort
but
when
this
small
apparatus
of
shallow
quickness
was
fetched
away
in
the
gig
by
luke
and
the
study
was
once
more
quite
lonely
for
tom
he
missed
her
grievously
he
had
really
been
brighter
and
had
got
through
his
lessons
better
since
she
had
been
there
and
she
had
asked
stelling
so
many
questions
about
the
roman
empire
and
whether
there
really
ever
was
a
man
who
said
in
latin
i
would
not
buy
it
for
a
farthing
or
a
rotten
nut
or
whether
that
had
only
been
turned
into
latin
that
tom
had
actually
come
to
a
dim
understanding
of
the
fact
that
there
had
once
been
people
upon
the
earth
who
were
so
fortunate
as
to
know
latin
without
learning
it
through
the
medium
of
the
eton
grammar
this
luminous
idea
was
a
great
addition
to
his
historical
acquirements
during
this
which
were
otherwise
confined
to
an
epitomized
history
of
the
jews
but
the
dreary
come
to
an
end
how
glad
tom
was
to
see
the
last
yellow
leaves
fluttering
before
the
cold
wind
the
dark
afternoons
and
the
first
december
snow
seemed
to
him
far
livelier
than
the
august
sunshine
and
that
he
might
make
himself
the
surer
about
the
flight
of
the
days
that
were
carrying
him
homeward
he
stuck
sticks
deep
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
when
he
was
three
weeks
from
the
holidays
and
pulled
one
up
every
day
with
a
great
wrench
throwing
it
to
a
distance
with
a
vigor
of
will
which
would
have
carried
it
to
limbo
if
it
had
been
in
the
nature
of
sticks
to
travel
so
far
but
it
was
worth
purchasing
even
at
the
heavy
price
of
the
latin
grammar
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
bright
light
in
the
parlor
at
home
as
the
gig
passed
noiselessly
over
the
bridge
the
happiness
of
passing
from
the
cold
air
to
the
warmth
and
the
kisses
and
the
smiles
of
that
familiar
hearth
where
the
pattern
of
the
rug
and
the
grate
and
the
were
first
ideas
that
it
was
no
more
possible
to
criticise
than
the
solidity
and
extension
of
matter
there
is
no
sense
of
ease
like
the
ease
we
felt
in
those
scenes
where
we
were
born
where
objects
became
dear
to
us
before
we
had
known
the
labor
of
choice
and
where
the
outer
world
seemed
only
an
extension
of
our
own
personality
we
accepted
and
loved
it
as
we
accepted
our
own
sense
of
existence
and
our
own
limbs
very
commonplace
even
ugly
that
furniture
of
our
early
home
might
look
if
it
were
put
up
to
auction
an
improved
taste
in
upholstery
scorns
it
and
is
not
the
striving
after
something
better
and
better
in
our
surroundings
the
grand
characteristic
that
distinguishes
man
from
the
brute
or
to
satisfy
a
scrupulous
accuracy
of
definition
that
distinguishes
the
british
man
from
the
foreign
brute
but
heaven
knows
where
that
striving
might
lead
us
if
our
affections
had
not
a
trick
of
twining
round
those
old
inferior
things
if
the
loves
and
sanctities
of
our
life
had
no
deep
immovable
roots
in
memory
one
delight
in
an
elderberry
bush
overhanging
the
confused
leafage
of
a
hedgerow
bank
as
a
more
gladdening
sight
than
the
finest
cistus
or
fuchsia
spreading
itself
on
the
softest
undulating
turf
is
an
entirely
unjustifiable
preference
to
a
or
to
any
of
those
regulated
minds
who
are
free
from
the
weakness
of
any
attachment
that
does
not
rest
on
a
demonstrable
superiority
of
qualities
and
there
is
no
better
reason
for
preferring
this
elderberry
bush
than
that
it
stirs
an
early
memory
that
it
is
no
novelty
in
my
life
speaking
to
me
merely
through
my
present
sensibilities
to
form
and
color
but
the
long
companion
of
my
existence
that
wove
itself
into
my
joys
when
joys
were
vivid
chapter
ii
the
christmas
holidays
fine
old
christmas
with
the
snowy
hair
and
ruddy
face
had
done
his
duty
that
year
in
the
noblest
fashion
and
had
set
off
his
rich
gifts
of
warmth
and
color
with
all
the
heightening
contrast
of
frost
and
snow
snow
lay
on
the
croft
and
in
undulations
softer
than
the
limbs
of
infancy
it
lay
with
the
neatliest
finished
border
on
every
sloping
roof
making
the
gables
stand
out
with
a
new
depth
of
color
it
weighed
heavily
on
the
laurels
and
till
it
fell
from
them
with
a
shuddering
sound
it
clothed
the
rough
with
whiteness
and
made
the
sheep
look
like
dark
blotches
the
gates
were
all
blocked
up
with
the
sloping
drifts
and
here
and
there
a
disregarded
beast
stood
as
if
petrified
in
unrecumbent
sadness
there
was
no
gleam
no
shadow
for
the
heavens
too
were
one
still
pale
cloud
no
sound
or
motion
in
anything
but
the
dark
river
that
flowed
and
moaned
like
an
unresting
sorrow
but
old
christmas
smiled
as
he
laid
this
spell
on
the
outdoor
world
for
he
meant
to
light
up
home
with
new
brightness
to
deepen
all
the
richness
of
indoor
color
and
give
a
keener
edge
of
delight
to
the
warm
fragrance
of
food
he
meant
to
prepare
a
sweet
imprisonment
that
would
strengthen
the
primitive
fellowship
of
kindred
and
make
the
sunshine
of
familiar
human
faces
as
welcome
as
the
hidden
his
kindness
fell
but
hardly
on
the
homeless
fell
but
hardly
on
the
homes
where
the
hearth
was
not
very
warm
and
where
the
food
had
little
fragrance
where
the
human
faces
had
had
no
sunshine
in
them
but
rather
the
leaden
gaze
of
unexpectant
want
but
the
fine
old
season
meant
well
and
if
he
has
not
learned
the
secret
how
to
bless
men
impartially
it
is
because
his
father
time
with
unrelenting
purpose
still
hides
that
secret
in
his
own
mighty
heart
and
yet
this
christmas
day
in
spite
of
tom
fresh
delight
in
home
was
not
he
thought
somehow
or
other
quite
so
happy
as
it
had
always
been
before
the
red
berries
were
just
as
abundant
on
the
holly
and
he
and
maggie
had
dressed
all
the
windows
and
mantlepieces
and
on
christmas
eve
with
as
much
taste
as
ever
wedding
the
scarlet
clusters
with
branches
of
the
ivy
there
had
been
singing
under
the
windows
after
midnight
supernatural
singing
maggie
always
felt
in
spite
of
tom
contemptuous
insistence
that
the
singers
were
old
patch
the
parish
clerk
and
the
rest
of
the
church
choir
she
trembled
with
awe
when
their
carolling
broke
in
upon
her
dreams
and
the
image
of
men
in
fustian
clothes
was
always
thrust
away
by
the
vision
of
angels
resting
on
the
parted
cloud
the
midnight
chant
had
helped
as
usual
to
lift
the
morning
above
the
level
of
common
days
and
then
there
were
the
smell
of
hot
toast
and
ale
from
the
kitchen
at
the
breakfast
hour
the
favorite
anthem
the
green
boughs
and
the
short
sermon
gave
the
appropriate
festal
character
to
the
and
aunt
and
uncle
moss
with
all
their
seven
children
were
looking
like
so
many
reflectors
of
the
bright
when
the
came
back
stamping
the
snow
from
their
feet
the
was
of
the
same
handsome
roundness
as
ever
and
came
in
with
the
symbolic
blue
flames
around
it
as
if
it
had
been
heroically
snatched
from
the
nether
fires
into
which
it
had
been
thrown
by
dyspeptic
puritans
the
dessert
was
as
splendid
as
ever
with
its
golden
oranges
brown
nuts
and
the
crystalline
light
and
dark
of
and
damson
cheese
in
all
these
things
christmas
was
as
it
had
always
been
since
tom
could
remember
it
was
only
distinguished
if
by
anything
by
superior
sliding
and
snowballs
christmas
was
cheery
but
not
so
tulliver
he
was
irate
and
defiant
and
tom
though
he
espoused
his
father
quarrels
and
shared
his
father
sense
of
injury
was
not
without
some
of
the
feeling
that
oppressed
maggie
when
tulliver
got
louder
and
more
angry
in
narration
and
assertion
with
the
increased
leisure
of
dessert
the
attention
that
tom
might
have
concentrated
on
his
nuts
and
wine
was
distracted
by
a
sense
that
there
were
rascally
enemies
in
the
world
and
that
the
business
of
life
could
hardly
be
conducted
without
a
good
deal
of
quarrelling
now
tom
was
not
fond
of
quarrelling
unless
it
could
soon
be
put
an
end
to
by
a
fair
fight
with
an
adversary
whom
he
had
every
chance
of
thrashing
and
his
father
irritable
talk
made
him
uncomfortable
though
he
never
accounted
to
himself
for
the
feeling
or
conceived
the
notion
that
his
father
was
faulty
in
this
respect
the
particular
embodiment
of
the
evil
principle
now
exciting
tulliver
determined
resistance
was
pivart
who
having
lands
higher
up
the
ripple
was
taking
measures
for
their
irrigation
which
either
were
or
would
be
or
were
bound
to
be
on
the
principle
that
water
was
water
an
infringement
on
tulliver
legitimate
share
of
dix
who
had
a
mill
on
the
stream
was
a
feeble
auxiliary
of
old
harry
compared
with
pivart
dix
had
been
brought
to
his
senses
by
arbitration
and
wakem
advice
had
not
carried
far
no
dix
tulliver
considered
had
been
as
good
as
nowhere
in
point
of
law
and
in
the
intensity
of
his
indignation
against
pivart
his
contempt
for
a
baffled
adversary
like
dix
began
to
wear
the
air
of
a
friendly
attachment
he
had
no
male
audience
except
moss
who
knew
nothing
as
he
said
of
the
natur
o
mills
and
could
only
assent
to
tulliver
arguments
on
the
ground
of
family
relationship
and
monetary
obligation
but
tulliver
did
not
talk
with
the
futile
intention
of
convincing
his
audience
he
talked
to
relieve
himself
while
good
moss
made
strong
efforts
to
keep
his
eyes
wide
open
in
spite
of
the
sleepiness
which
an
unusually
good
dinner
produced
in
his
frame
moss
more
alive
to
the
subject
and
interested
in
everything
that
affected
her
brother
listened
and
put
in
a
word
as
often
as
maternal
preoccupations
allowed
why
pivart
a
new
name
hereabout

is
it
she
said
he
did
own
the
land
in
father
time
nor
yours
either
before
i
was
married
new
name
yes
i
should
think
it
a
new
name
said
tulliver
with
angry
emphasis
dorlcote
mill
been
in
our
family
a
hundred
year
and
better
and
nobody
ever
heard
of
a
pivart
meddling
with
the
river
till
this
fellow
came
and
bought
bincome
farm
out
of
hand
before
anybody
else
could
so
much
as
say
but
i
him
added
tulliver
lifting
his
glass
with
a
sense
that
he
had
defined
his
resolution
in
an
unmistakable
manner
you
wo
be
forced
to
go
to
law
with
him
i
hope
brother
said
moss
with
some
anxiety
i
do
know
what
i
shall
be
forced
to
but
i
know
what
i
shall
force
to
with
his
dikes
and
erigations
if
there
any
law
to
be
brought
to
bear
o
the
right
side
i
know
well
enough
who
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
got
wakem
to
back
him
and
egg
him
on
i
know
wakem
tells
him
the
law
ca
touch
him
for
it
but
there
folks
can
handle
the
law
besides
wakem
it
takes
a
big
raskil
to
beat
him
but
bigger
to
be
found
as
know
more
o
th
ins
and
outs
o
the
law
else
how
came
wakem
to
lose
brumley
suit
for
him
tulliver
was
a
strictly
honest
man
and
proud
of
being
honest
but
he
considered
that
in
law
the
ends
of
justice
could
only
be
achieved
by
employing
a
stronger
knave
to
frustrate
a
weaker
law
was
a
sort
of
in
which
it
was
the
business
of
injured
honesty
to
get
a
game
bird
with
the
best
pluck
and
the
strongest
spurs
gore
no
fool
you
need
tell
me
that
he
observed
presently
in
a
pugnacious
tone
as
if
poor
gritty
had
been
urging
that
capabilities
but
you
see
he
is
up
to
the
law
as
wakem
is
and
water
a
very
particular
thing
you
ca
pick
it
up
with
a
pitchfork
that
why
it
been
nuts
to
old
harry
and
the
lawyers
it
plain
enough
what
the
rights
and
the
wrongs
of
water
if
you
look
at
it
for
a
river
a
river
and
if
you
got
a
mill
you
must
have
water
to
turn
it
and
it
no
use
telling
me
pivart
erigation
and
nonsense
wo
stop
my
wheel
i
know
what
belongs
to
water
better
than
that
talk
to
me
o
what
th
engineers
say
i
say
it
common
sense
as
pivart
dikes
must
do
me
an
injury
but
if
that
their
engineering
i
put
tom
to
it
and
he
shall
see
if
he
ca
find
a
bit
more
sense
in
th
engineering
business
than
what
comes
to
tom
looking
round
with
some
anxiety
at
this
announcement
of
his
prospects
unthinkingly
withdrew
a
small
rattle
he
was
amusing
baby
moss
with
whereupon
she
being
a
baby
that
knew
her
own
mind
with
remarkable
clearness
instantaneously
expressed
her
sentiments
in
a
piercing
yell
and
was
not
to
be
appeased
even
by
the
restoration
of
the
rattle
feeling
apparently
that
the
original
wrong
of
having
it
taken
from
her
remained
in
all
its
force
moss
hurried
away
with
her
into
another
room
and
expressed
to
tulliver
who
accompanied
her
the
conviction
that
the
dear
child
had
good
reasons
for
crying
implying
that
if
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
rattle
that
baby
clamored
for
she
was
a
misunderstood
baby
the
thoroughly
justifiable
yell
being
quieted
moss
looked
at
her
and
said
i
sorry
to
see
brother
so
put
out
about
this
water
work
it
your
brother
way
moss
i
never
anything
o
that
sort
before
i
was
married
said
tulliver
with
a
reproach
she
always
spoke
of
her
husband
as
your
brother
to
moss
in
any
case
when
his
line
of
conduct
was
not
matter
of
pure
admiration
amiable
tulliver
who
was
never
angry
in
her
life
had
yet
her
mild
share
of
that
spirit
without
which
she
could
hardly
have
been
at
once
a
dodson
and
a
woman
being
always
on
the
defensive
toward
her
own
sisters
it
was
natural
that
she
should
be
keenly
conscious
of
her
superiority
even
as
the
weakest
dodson
over
a
husband
sister
who
besides
being
poorly
off
and
inclined
to
hang
on
her
brother
had
the
submissiveness
of
a
large
untidy
prolific
woman
with
affection
enough
in
her
not
only
for
her
own
husband
and
abundant
children
but
for
any
number
of
collateral
relations
i
hope
and
pray
he
wo
go
to
law
said
moss
for
never
any
knowing
where
that
end
and
the
right
does
allays
win
this
pivart
a
rich
man
by
what
i
can
make
out
and
the
rich
mostly
get
things
their
own
way
as
to
that
said
tulliver
stroking
her
dress
down
i
seen
what
riches
are
in
my
own
family
for
my
sisters
have
got
husbands
as
can
afford
to
do
pretty
much
what
they
like
but
i
think
sometimes
i
shall
be
drove
off
my
head
with
the
talk
about
this
law
and
erigation
and
my
sisters
lay
all
the
fault
to
me
for
they
do
know
what
it
is
to
marry
a
man
like
your
brother
how
should
they
sister
pullet
has
her
own
way
from
morning
till
night
well
said
moss
i
do
think
i
should
like
my
husband
if
he
had
got
any
wits
of
his
own
and
i
had
to
find
for
him
it
a
deal
easier
to
do
what
pleases
one
husband
than
to
be
puzzling
what
else
one
should
do
if
people
come
to
talk
o
doing
what
pleases
their
husbands
said
tulliver
with
a
faint
imitation
of
her
sister
glegg
i
sure
your
brother
might
have
waited
a
long
while
before
he
have
found
a
wife
that
have
let
him
have
his
say
in
everything
as
i
do
nothing
but
law
and
erigation
now
from
when
we
first
get
up
in
the
morning
till
we
go
to
bed
at
night
and
i
never
contradict
him
i
only
say
tulliver
do
as
you
like
but
whativer
you
do
go
to
law
tulliver
as
we
have
seen
was
not
without
influence
over
her
husband
no
woman
is
she
can
always
incline
him
to
do
either
what
she
wishes
or
the
reverse
and
on
the
composite
impulses
that
were
threatening
to
hurry
tulliver
into
law
monotonous
pleading
had
doubtless
its
share
of
force
it
might
even
be
comparable
to
that
proverbial
feather
which
has
the
credit
or
discredit
of
breaking
the
camel
back
though
on
a
strictly
impartial
view
the
blame
ought
rather
to
lie
with
the
previous
weight
of
feathers
which
had
already
placed
the
back
in
such
imminent
peril
that
an
otherwise
innocent
feather
could
not
settle
on
it
without
mischief
not
that
tulliver
feeble
beseeching
could
have
had
this
feather
weight
in
virtue
of
her
single
personality
but
whenever
she
departed
from
entire
assent
to
her
husband
he
saw
in
her
the
representative
of
the
dodson
family
and
it
was
a
guiding
principle
with
tulliver
to
let
the
dodsons
know
that
they
were
not
to
domineer
over
or
more
specifically
that
a
male
tulliver
was
far
more
than
equal
to
four
female
dodsons
even
though
one
of
them
was
glegg
but
not
even
a
direct
argument
from
that
typical
dodson
female
herself
against
his
going
to
law
could
have
heightened
his
disposition
toward
it
so
much
as
the
mere
thought
of
wakem
continually
freshened
by
the
sight
of
the
too
able
attorney
on
wakem
to
his
certain
knowledge
was
metaphorically
speaking
at
the
bottom
of
irrigation
wakem
had
tried
to
make
dix
stand
out
and
go
to
law
about
the
dam
it
was
unquestionably
wakem
who
had
caused
tulliver
to
lose
the
suit
about
the
right
of
road
and
the
bridge
that
made
a
thoroughfare
of
his
land
for
every
vagabond
who
preferred
an
opportunity
of
damaging
private
property
to
walking
like
an
honest
man
along
the
highroad
all
lawyers
were
more
or
less
rascals
but
rascality
was
of
that
peculiarly
aggravated
kind
which
placed
itself
in
opposition
to
that
form
of
right
embodied
in
interests
and
opinions
and
as
an
extra
touch
of
bitterness
the
injured
miller
had
recently
in
borrowing
the
five
hundred
pounds
been
obliged
to
carry
a
little
business
to
wakem
office
on
his
own
account
a
glib
fellow
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
always
looking
so
sure
of
his
game
and
it
was
vexatious
that
lawyer
gore
was
not
more
like
him
but
was
a
bald
man
with
bland
manners
and
fat
hands
a
that
you
would
be
rash
to
bet
upon
against
wakem
gore
was
a
sly
fellow
his
weakness
did
not
lie
on
the
side
of
scrupulosity
but
the
largest
amount
of
winking
however
significant
is
not
equivalent
to
seeing
through
a
stone
wall
and
confident
as
tulliver
was
in
his
principle
that
water
was
water
and
in
the
direct
inference
that
pivart
had
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
in
this
affair
of
irrigation
he
had
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
wakem
had
more
law
to
show
against
this
rationally
irrefragable
inference
than
gore
could
show
for
it
but
then
if
they
went
to
law
there
was
a
chance
for
tulliver
to
employ
counsellor
wylde
on
his
side
instead
of
having
that
admirable
bully
against
him
and
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
witness
of
wakem
made
to
perspire
and
become
confounded
as
tulliver
witness
had
once
been
was
alluring
to
the
love
of
retributive
justice
much
rumination
had
tulliver
on
these
puzzling
subjects
during
his
rides
on
the
gray
horse
much
turning
of
the
head
from
side
to
side
as
the
scales
dipped
alternately
but
the
probable
result
was
still
out
of
sight
only
to
be
reached
through
much
hot
argument
and
iteration
in
domestic
and
social
life
that
initial
stage
of
the
dispute
which
consisted
in
the
narration
of
the
case
and
the
enforcement
of
tulliver
views
concerning
it
throughout
the
entire
circle
of
his
connections
would
necessarily
take
time
and
at
the
beginning
of
february
when
tom
was
going
to
school
again
there
were
scarcely
any
new
items
to
be
detected
in
his
father
statement
of
the
case
against
pivart
or
any
more
specific
indication
of
the
measures
he
was
bent
on
taking
against
that
rash
contravener
of
the
principle
that
water
was
water
iteration
like
friction
is
likely
to
generate
heat
instead
of
progress
and
tulliver
heat
was
certainly
more
and
more
palpable
if
there
had
been
no
new
evidence
on
any
other
point
there
had
been
new
evidence
that
pivart
was
as
thick
as
mud
with
wakem

evening
near

going
to
send
his
son
to
stelling
it
is
true
what
they
said
about
his
going
to
be
sent
to
france
you
wo
like
me
to
go
to
school
with
wakem
son
shall
you
it
no
matter
for
that
my
boy
said
tulliver
do
you
learn
anything
bad
of
him
that
all
the
lad
a
poor
deformed
creatur
and
takes
after
his
mother
in
the
face
i
think
there
is
much
of
his
father
in
him
it
a
sign
wakem
thinks
high
o
sterling
as
he
sends
his
son
to
him
and
wakem
knows
meal
from
bran
tulliver
in
his
heart
was
rather
proud
of
the
fact
that
his
son
was
to
have
the
same
advantages
as
wakem
but
tom
was
not
at
all
easy
on
the
point
it
would
have
been
much
clearer
if
the
lawyer
son
had
not
been
deformed
for
then
tom
would
have
had
the
prospect
of
pitching
into
him
with
all
that
freedom
which
is
derived
from
a
high
moral
sanction
chapter
iii
the
new
schoolfellow
it
was
a
cold
wet
january
day
on
which
tom
went
back
to
school
a
day
quite
in
keeping
with
this
severe
phase
of
his
destiny
if
he
had
not
carried
in
his
pocket
a
parcel
of
and
a
small
dutch
doll
for
little
laura
there
would
have
been
no
ray
of
expected
pleasure
to
enliven
the
general
gloom
but
he
liked
to
think
how
laura
would
put
out
her
lips
and
her
tiny
hands
for
the
bits
of
sugarcandy
and
to
give
the
greater
keenness
to
these
pleasures
of
imagination
he
took
out
the
parcel
made
a
small
hole
in
the
paper
and
bit
off
a
crystal
or
two
which
had
so
solacing
an
effect
under
the
confined
prospect
and
damp
odors
of
the
that
he
repeated
the
process
more
than
once
on
his
way
well
tulliver
we
glad
to
see
you
again
said
stelling
heartily
take
off
your
wrappings
and
come
into
the
study
till
dinner
you
find
a
bright
fire
there
and
a
new
companion
tom
felt
in
an
uncomfortable
flutter
as
he
took
off
his
woollen
comforter
and
other
wrappings
he
had
seen
philip
wakem
at
ogg
but
had
always
turned
his
eyes
away
from
him
as
quickly
as
possible
he
would
have
disliked
having
a
deformed
boy
for
his
companion
even
if
philip
had
not
been
the
son
of
a
bad
man
and
tom
did
not
see
how
a
bad
man
son
could
be
very
good
his
own
father
was
a
good
man
and
he
would
readily
have
fought
any
one
who
said
the
contrary
he
was
in
a
state
of
mingled
embarrassment
and
defiance
as
he
followed
stelling
to
the
study
here
is
a
new
companion
for
you
to
shake
hands
with
tulliver
said
that
gentleman
on
entering
the
study
master
philip
wakem
i
shall
leave
you
to
make
acquaintance
by
yourselves
you
already
know
something
of
each
other
i
imagine
for
you
are
neighbors
at
home
tom
looked
confused
and
awkward
while
philip
rose
and
glanced
at
him
timidly
tom
did
not
like
to
go
up
and
put
out
his
hand
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
say
how
do
you
do
on
so
short

notice
stelling
wisely
turned
away
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
shyness
only
wears
off
in
the
absence
of
their
elders
philip
was
at
once
too
proud
and
too
timid
to
walk
toward
tom
he
thought
or
rather
felt
that
tom
had
an
aversion
to
looking
at
him
every
one
almost
disliked
looking
at
him
and
his
deformity
was
more
conspicuous
when
he
walked
so
they
remained
without
shaking
hands
or
even
speaking
while
tom
went
to
the
fire
and
warmed
himself
every
now
and
then
casting
furtive
glances
at
philip
who
seemed
to
be
drawing
absently
first
one
object
and
then
another
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
had
before
him
he
had
seated
himself
again
and
as
he
drew
was
thinking
what
he
could
say
to
tom
and
trying
to
overcome
his
own
repugnance
to
making
the
first
advances
tom
began
to
look
oftener
and
longer
at
philip
face
for
he
could
see
it
without
noticing
the
hump
and
it
was
really
not
a
disagreeable
face
very
tom
thought
he
wondered
how
much
older
philip
was
than
himself
an
anatomist
even
a
mere
physiognomist
would
have
seen
that
the
deformity
of
philip
spine
was
not
a
congenital
hump
but
the
result
of
an
accident
in
infancy
but
you
do
not
expect
from
tom
any
acquaintance
with
such
distinctions
to
him
philip
was
simply
a
humpback
he
had
a
vague
notion
that
the
deformity
of
wakem
son
had
some
relation
to
the
rascality
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
his
father
talk
with
hot
emphasis
and
he
felt
too
a
fear
of
him
as
probably
a
spiteful
fellow
who
not
being
able
to
fight
you
had
cunning
ways
of
doing
you
a
mischief
by
the
sly
there
was
a
humpbacked
tailor
in
the
neighborhood
of
jacobs
academy
who
was
considered
a
very
unamiable
character
and
was
much
hooted
after
by
boys
solely
on
the
ground
of
his
unsatisfactory
moral
qualities
so
that
tom
was
not
without
a
basis
of
fact
to
go
upon
still
no
face
could
be
more
unlike
that
ugly
tailor
than
this
melancholy
face
the
brown
hair
round
it
waved
and
curled
at
the
ends
like
a
girl
tom
thought
that
truly
pitiable
this
wakem
was
a
pale
puny
fellow
and
it
was
quite
clear
he
would
not
be
able
to
play
at
anything
worth
speaking
of
but
he
handled
his
pencil
in
an
enviable
manner
and
was
apparently
making
one
thing
after
another
without
any
trouble
what
was
he
drawing
tom
was
quite
warm
now
and
wanted
something
new
to
be
going
forward
it
was
certainly
more
agreeable
to
have
an
humpback
as
a
companion
than
to
stand
looking
out
of
the
study
window
at
the
rain
and
kicking
his
foot
against
the
washboard
in
solitude
something
would
happen
every
day
a
quarrel
or
something
and
tom
thought
he
should
rather
like
to
show
philip
that
he
had
better
not
try
his
spiteful
tricks
on
he
suddenly
walked
across
the
hearth
and
looked
over
philip
paper
why
that
a
donkey
with
panniers
and
a
spaniel
and
partridges
in
the
corn
he
exclaimed
his
tongue
being
completely
loosed
by
surprise
and
admiration
oh
my
buttons
i
wish
i
could
draw
like
that
i
to
learn
drawing
this
half
i
wonder
if
i
shall
learn
to
make
dogs
and
donkeys
oh
you
can
do
them
without
learning
said
philip
i
never
learned
drawing
never
learned
said
tom
in
amazement
why
when
i
make
dogs
and
horses
and
those
things
the
heads
and
the
legs
wo
come
right
though
i
can
see
how
they
ought
to
be
very
well
i
can
make
houses
and
all
sorts
of
chimneys
chimneys
going
all
down
the
wall
and
windows
in
the
roof
and
all
that
but
i
dare
say
i
could
do
dogs
and
horses
if
i
was
to
try
more
he
added
reflecting
that
philip
might
falsely
suppose
that
he
was
going
to
knock
under
if
he
were
too
frank
about
the
imperfection
of
his
accomplishments
oh
yes
said
philip
it
very
easy
you
only
to
look
well
at
things
and
draw
them
over
and
over
again
what
you
do
wrong
once
you
can
alter
the
next
time
but
have
you
been
taught
said
tom
beginning
to
have
a
puzzled
suspicion
that
philip
crooked
back
might
be
the
source
of
remarkable
faculties
i
thought
you
been
to
school
a
long
while
yes
said
philip
smiling
i
been
taught
latin
and
greek
and
mathematics
and
writing
and
such
things
oh
but
i
say
you
do
like
latin
though
do
you
said
tom
lowering
his
voice
confidentially
pretty
well
i
do
care
much
about
it
said
philip
ah
but
perhaps
you
have
got
into
the
quæ
said
tom
nodding
his
head
sideways
as
much
as
to
say
that
was
the
test
it
was
easy
talking
till
you
came
to
philip
felt
some
bitter
complacency
in
the
promising
stupidity
of
this
boy
but
made
polite
by
his
own
extreme
sensitiveness
as
well
as
by
his
desire
to
conciliate
he
checked
his
inclination
to
laugh
and
said
quietly
i
done
with
the
grammar
i
do
learn
that
any
more
then
you
wo
have
the
same
lessons
as
i
shall
said
tom
with
a
sense
of
disappointment
no
but
i
dare
say
i
can
help
you
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
help
you
if
i
can
tom
did
not
say
thank
you
for
he
was
quite
absorbed
in
the
thought
that
wakem
son
did
not
seem
so
spiteful
a
fellow
as
might
have
been
expected
i
say
he
said
presently
do
you
love
your
father
yes
said
philip
coloring
deeply
do
you
love
yours
oh
yes
i
only
wanted
to
know
said
tom
rather
ashamed
of
himself
now
he
saw
philip
coloring
and
looking
uncomfortable
he
found
much
difficulty
in
adjusting
his
attitude
of
mind
toward
the
son
of
lawyer
wakem
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
if
philip
disliked
his
father
that
fact
might
go
some
way
toward
clearing
up
his
perplexity
shall
you
learn
drawing
now
he
said
by
way
of
changing
the
subject
no
said
philip
my
father
wishes
me
to
give
all
my
time
to
other
things
now
what
latin
and
euclid
and
those
things
said
tom
yes
said
philip
who
had
left
off
using
his
pencil
and
was
resting
his
head
on
one
hand
while
tom
was
learning
forward
on
both
elbows
and
looking
with
increasing
admiration
at
the
dog
and
the
donkey
and
you
do
mind
that
said
tom
with
strong
curiosity
no
i
like
to
know
what
everybody
else
knows
i
can
study
what
i
like
i
ca
think
why
anybody
should
learn
latin
said
tom
it
no
good
it
part
of
the
education
of
a
gentleman
said
philip
all
gentlemen
learn
the
same
things
what
do
you
think
sir
john
crake
the
master
of
the
harriers
knows
latin
said
tom
who
had
often
thought
he
should
like
to
resemble
sir
john
crake
he
learned
it
when
he
was
a
boy
of
course
said
philip
but
i
dare
say
he
forgotten
it
oh
well
i
can
do
that
then
said
tom
not
with
any
epigrammatic
intention
but
with
serious
satisfaction
at
the
idea
that
as
far
as
latin
was
concerned
there
was
no
hindrance
to
his
resembling
sir
john
crake
only
you
obliged
to
remember
it
while
you
at
school
else
you
got
to
learn
ever
so
many
lines
of
stelling
very
particular
did
you
know
he
have
you
up
ten
times
if
you
say
for
he
wo
let
you
go
a
letter
wrong
can
tell
you
oh
i
do
mind
said
philip
unable
to
choke
a
laugh
i
can
remember
things
easily
and
there
are
some
lessons
i
very
fond
of
i
very
fond
of
greek
history
and
everything
about
the
greeks
i
should
like
to
have
been
a
greek
and
fought
the
persians
and
then
have
come
home
and
have
written
tragedies
or
else
have
been
listened
to
by
everybody
for
my
wisdom
like
socrates
and
have
died
a
grand
death
philip
you
perceive
was
not
without
a
wish
to
impress
the
barbarian
with
a
sense
of
his
mental
superiority
why
were
the
greeks
great
fighters
said
tom
who
saw
a
vista
in
this
direction
is
there
anything
like
david
and
goliath
and
samson
in
the
greek
history
those
are
the
only
bits
i
like
in
the
history
of
the
jews
oh
there
are
very
fine
stories
of
that
sort
about
the
greeks
about
the
heroes
of
early
times
who
killed
the
wild
beasts
as
samson
did
and
in
the
odyssey
that
a
beautiful
poem
there
a
more
wonderful
giant
than
goliath
polypheme
who
had
only
one
eye
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
and
ulysses
a
little
fellow
but
very
wise
and
cunning
got
a
and
stuck
it
into
this
one
eye
and
made
him
roar
like
a
thousand
bulls
oh
what
fun
said
tom
jumping
away
from
the
table
and
stamping
first
with
one
leg
and
then
the
other
i
say
can
you
tell
me
all
about
those
stories
because
i
learn
greek
you
know
shall
i
he
added
pausing
in
his
stamping
with
a
sudden
alarm
lest
the
contrary
might
be
possible
does
every
gentleman
learn
greek
will
stelling
make
me
begin
with
it
do
you
think
no
i
should
think
not
very
likely
not
said
philip
but
you
may
read
those
stories
without
knowing
greek
i
got
them
in
english
oh
but
i
do
like
reading
i
sooner
have
you
tell
them
me
but
only
the
fighting
ones
you
know
my
sister
maggie
is
always
wanting
to
tell
me
stories
but
they
stupid
things
girls
stories
always
are
can
you
tell
a
good
many
fighting
stories
oh
yes
said
philip
lots
of
them
besides
the
greek
stories
i
can
tell
you
about
richard
and
saladin
and
about
william
wallace
and
robert
bruce
and
james
douglas
i
know
no
end
you
older
than
i
am
are
you
said
tom
why
how
old
are
i
fifteen
i
only
going
in
fourteen
said
tom
but
i
thrashed
all
the
fellows
at
jacob
that
where
i
was
before
i
came
here
and
i
beat
all
at
bandy
and
climbing
and
i
wish
stelling
would
let
us
go
fishing
could
show
you
how
to
fish
you
fish
you
it
only
standing
and
sitting
still
you
know
tom
in
his
turn
wished
to
make
the
balance
dip
in
his
favor
this
hunchback
must
not
suppose
that
his
acquaintance
with
fighting
stories
put
him
on
a
par
with
an
actual
fighting
hero
like
tom
tulliver
philip
winced
under
this
allusion
to
his
unfitness
for
active
sports
and
he
answered
almost
peevishly
i
ca
bear
fishing
i
think
people
look
like
fools
sitting
watching
a
line
hour
after
hour
or
else
throwing
and
throwing
and
catching
nothing
ah
but
you
would
say
they
looked
like
fools
when
they
landed
a
big
pike
i
can
tell
you
said
tom
who
had
never
caught
anything
that
was
big
in
his
life
but
whose
imagination
was
on
the
stretch
with
indignant
zeal
for
the
honor
of
sport
wakem
son
it
was
plain
had
his
disagreeable
points
and
must
be
kept
in
due
check
happily
for
the
harmony
of
this
first
interview
they
were
now
called
to
dinner
and
philip
was
not
allowed
to
develop
farther
his
unsound
views
on
the
subject
of
fishing
but
tom
said
to
himself
that
was
just
what
he
should
have
expected
from
a
hunchback
chapter
iv
the
young
idea
the
alterations
of
feeling
in
that
first
dialogue
between
tom
and
philip
continued
to
make
their
intercourse
even
after
many
weeks
of
schoolboy
intimacy
tom
never
quite
lost
the
feeling
that
philip
being
the
son
of
a
rascal
was
his
natural
enemy
never
thoroughly
overcame
his
repulsion
to
philip
deformity
he
was
a
boy
who
adhered
tenaciously
to
impressions
once
received
as
with
all
minds
in
which
mere
perception
predominates
over
thought
and
emotion
the
external
remained
to
him
rigidly
what
it
was
in
the
first
instance
but
then
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
philip
company
when
he
was
in
a
good
humor
he
could
help
one
so
well
in
one
latin
exercises
which
tom
regarded
as
a
kind
of
puzzle
that
could
only
be
found
out
by
a
lucky
chance
and
he
could
tell
such
wonderful
fighting
stories
about
hal
of
the
wynd
for
example
and
other
heroes
who
were
especial
favorites
with
tom
because
they
laid
about
them
with
heavy
strokes
he
had
small
opinion
of
saladin
whose
cimeter
could
cut
a
cushion
in
two
in
an
instant
who
wanted
to
cut
cushions
that
was
a
stupid
story
and
he
did
care
to
hear
it
again
but
when
robert
bruce
on
the
black
pony
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
lifting
his
good
cracked
at
once
the
helmet
and
the
skull
of
the
too
hasty
knight
at
bannockburn
then
tom
felt
all
the
exaltation
of
sympathy
and
if
he
had
had
a
cocoanut
at
hand
he
would
have
cracked
it
at
once
with
the
poker
philip
in
his
happier
moods
indulged
tom
to
the
top
of
his
bent
heightening
the
crash
and
bang
and
fury
of
every
fight
with
all
the
artillery
of
epithets
and
similes
at
his
command
but
he
was
not
always
in
a
good
humor
or
happy
mood
the
slight
spurt
of
peevish
susceptibility
which
had
escaped
him
in
their
first
interview
was
a
symptom
of
a
perpetually
recurring
mental
ailment
half
of
it
nervous
irritability
half
of
it
the
produced
by
the
sense
of
his
deformity
in
these
fits
of
susceptibility
every
glance
seemed
to
him
to
be
charged
either
with
offensive
pity
or
with
disgust
at
the
very
least
it
was
an
indifferent
glance
and
philip
felt
indifference
as
a
child
of
the
south
feels
the
chill
air
of
a
northern
spring
poor
tom
blundering
patronage
when
they
were
out
of
doors
together
would
sometimes
make
him
turn
upon
the
lad
quite
savagely
and
his
eyes
usually
sad
and
quiet
would
flash
with
anything
but
playful
lightning
no
wonder
tom
retained
his
suspicions
of
the
humpback
but
philip
skill
in
drawing
was
another
link
between
them
for
tom
found
to
his
disgust
that
his
new
gave
him
no
dogs
and
donkeys
to
draw
but
brooks
and
rustic
bridges
and
ruins
all
with
a
general
softness
of
surface
indicating
that
nature
if
anything
was
rather
satiny
and
as
tom
feeling
for
the
picturesque
in
landscape
was
at
present
quite
latent
it
is
not
surprising
that
goodrich
productions
seemed
to
him
an
uninteresting
form
of
art
tulliver
having
a
vague
intention
that
tom
should
be
put
to
some
business
which
included
the
drawing
out
of
plans
and
maps
had
complained
to
riley
when
he
saw
him
at
mudport
that
tom
seemed
to
be
learning
nothing
of
that
sort
whereupon
that
obliging
adviser
had
suggested
that
tom
should
have
tulliver
must
not
mind
paying
extra
for
drawing
let
tom
be
made
a
good
draughtsman
and
he
would
be
able
to
turn
his
pencil
to
any
purpose
so
it
was
ordered
that
tom
should
have
and
whom
should
stelling
have
selected
as
a
master
if
not
goodrich
who
was
considered
quite
at
the
head
of
his
profession
within
a
circuit
of
twelve
miles
round
king
lorton
by
which
means
tom
learned
to
make
an
extremely
fine
point
to
his
pencil
and
to
represent
landscape
with
a
broad
generality
which
doubtless
from
a
narrow
tendency
in
his
mind
to
details
he
thought
extremely
dull
all
this
you
remember
happened
in
those
dark
ages
when
there
were
no
schools
of
design
before
schoolmasters
were
invariably
men
of
scrupulous
integrity
and
before
the
clergy
were
all
men
of
enlarged
minds
and
varied
culture
in
those
less
favored
days
it
is
no
fable
that
there
were
other
clergymen
besides
stelling
who
had
narrow
intellects
and
large
wants
and
whose
income
by
a
logical
confusion
to
which
fortune
being
a
female
as
well
as
blindfold
is
peculiarly
liable
was
proportioned
not
to
their
wants
but
to
their
intellect
with
which
income
has
clearly
no
inherent
relation
the
problem
these
gentlemen
had
to
solve
was
to
readjust
the
proportion
between
their
wants
and
their
income
and
since
wants
are
not
easily
starved
to
death
the
simpler
method
appeared
to
be
to
raise
their
income
there
was
but
one
way
of
doing
this
any
of
those
low
callings
in
which
men
are
obliged
to
do
good
work
at
a
low
price
were
forbidden
to
clergymen
was
it
their
fault
if
their
only
resource
was
to
turn
out
very
poor
work
at
a
high
price
besides
how
should
stelling
be
expected
to
know
that
education
was
a
delicate
and
difficult
business
any
more
than
an
animal
endowed
with
a
power
of
boring
a
hole
through
a
rock
should
be
expected
to
have
wide
views
of
excavation
stelling
faculties
had
been
early
trained
to
boring
in
a
straight
line
and
he
had
no
faculty
to
spare
but
among
tom
contemporaries
whose
fathers
cast
their
sons
on
clerical
instruction
to
find
them
ignorant
after
many
days
there
were
many
far
less
lucky
than
tom
tulliver
education
was
almost
entirely
a
matter
of
luck
usually
of
in
those
distant
days
the
state
of
mind
in
which
you
take
a
or
a
in
your
hand
is
one
of
sober
certainty
compared
with
that
of
fathers
like
tulliver
when
they
selected
a
school
or
a
tutor
for
their
sons
excellent
men
who
had
been
forced
all
their
lives
to
spell
on
an
system
and
having
carried
on
a
successful
business
in
spite
of
this
disadvantage
had
acquired
money
enough
to
give
their
sons
a
better
start
in
life
than
they
had
had
themselves
must
necessarily
take
their
chance
as
to
the
conscience
and
the
competence
of
the
schoolmaster
whose
circular
fell
in
their
way
and
appeared
to
promise
so
much
more
than
they
would
ever
have
thought
of
asking
for
including
the
return
of
linen
fork
and
spoon
it
was
happy
for
them
if
some
ambitious
draper
of
their
acquaintance
had
not
brought
up
his
son
to
the
church
and
if
that
young
gentleman
at
the
age
of
had
not
closed
his
college
dissipations
by
an
imprudent
marriage
otherwise
these
innocent
fathers
desirous
of
doing
the
best
for
their
offspring
could
only
escape
the
draper
son
by
happening
to
be
on
the
foundation
of
a
as
yet
unvisited
by
commissioners
where
two
or
three
boys
could
have
all
to
themselves
the
advantages
of
a
large
and
lofty
building
together
with
a
toothless
and
deaf
whose
erudite
indistinctness
and
inattention
were
engrossed
by
them
at
the
rate
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
ripe
scholar
doubtless
when
first
appointed
but
all
ripeness
beneath
the
sun
has
a
further
stage
less
esteemed
in
the
market
tom
tulliver
then
compared
with
many
other
british
youths
of
his
time
who
have
since
had
to
scramble
through
life
with
some
fragments
of
more
or
less
relevant
knowledge
and
a
great
deal
of
strictly
relevant
ignorance
was
not
so
very
unlucky
stelling
was
a
healthy
man
with
the
bearing
of
a
gentleman
a
conviction
that
a
growing
boy
required
a
sufficiency
of
beef
and
a
certain
hearty
kindness
in
him
that
made
him
like
to
see
tom
looking
well
and
enjoying
his
dinner
not
a
man
of
refined
conscience
or
with
any
deep
sense
of
the
infinite
issues
belonging
to
duties
not
quite
competent
to
his
high
offices
but
incompetent
gentlemen
must
live
and
without
private
fortune
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
they
could
all
live
genteelly
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
education
or
government
besides
it
was
the
fault
of
tom
mental
constitution
that
his
faculties
could
not
be
nourished
on
the
sort
of
knowledge
stelling
had
to
communicate
a
boy
born
with
a
deficient
power
of
apprehending
signs
and
abstractions
must
suffer
the
penalty
of
his
congenital
deficiency
just
as
if
he
had
been
born
with
one
leg
shorter
than
the
other
a
method
of
education
sanctioned
by
the
long
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestors
was
not
to
give
way
before
the
exceptional
dulness
of
a
boy
who
was
merely
living
at
the
time
then
present
and
stelling
was
convinced
that
a
boy
so
stupid
at
signs
and
abstractions
must
be
stupid
at
everything
else
even
if
that
reverend
gentleman
could
have
taught
him
everything
else
it
was
the
practice
of
our
venerable
ancestors
to
apply
that
ingenious
instrument
the
and
to
tighten
and
tighten
it
in
order
to
elicit
facts
they
had
a
fixed
opinion
to
begin
with
that
the
facts
were
existent
and
what
had
they
to
do
but
to
tighten
the
in
like
manner
stelling
had
a
fixed
opinion
that
all
boys
with
any
capacity
could
learn
what
it
was
the
only
regular
thing
to
teach
if
they
were
slow
the
must
be
tightened
the
exercises
must
be
insisted
on
with
increased
severity
and
a
page
of
virgil
be
awarded
as
a
penalty
to
encourage
and
stimulate
a
too
languid
inclination
to
latin
verse
the
was
a
little
relaxed
however
during
this
second
philip
was
so
advanced
in
his
studies
and
so
apt
that
stelling
could
obtain
credit
by
his
facility
which
required
little
help
much
more
easily
than
by
the
troublesome
process
of
overcoming
tom
dulness
gentlemen
with
broad
chests
and
ambitious
intentions
do
sometimes
disappoint
their
friends
by
failing
to
carry
the
world
before
them
perhaps
it
is
that
high
achievements
demand
some
other
unusual
qualification
besides
an
unusual
desire
for
high
prizes
perhaps
it
is
that
these
stalwart
gentlemen
are
rather
indolent
their
particulum
being
obstructed
from
soaring
by
a
too
hearty
appetite
some
reason
or
other
there
was
why
stelling
deferred
the
execution
of
many
spirited
projects
why
he
did
not
begin
the
editing
of
his
greek
play
or
any
other
work
of
scholarship
in
his
leisure
hours
but
after
turning
the
key
of
his
private
study
with
much
resolution
sat
down
to
one
of
theodore
hook
novels
tom
was
gradually
allowed
to
shuffle
through
his
lessons
with
less
rigor
and
having
philip
to
help
him
he
was
able
to
make
some
show
of
having
applied
his
mind
in
a
confused
and
blundering
way
without
being
into
a
betrayal
that
his
mind
had
been
entirely
neutral
in
the
matter
he
thought
school
much
more
bearable
under
this
modification
of
circumstances
and
he
went
on
contentedly
enough
picking
up
a
promiscuous
education
chiefly
from
things
that
were
not
intended
as
education
at
all
what
was
understood
to
be
his
education
was
simply
the
practice
of
reading
writing
and
spelling
carried
on
by
an
elaborate
appliance
of
unintelligible
ideas
and
by
much
failure
in
the
effort
to
learn
by
rote
nevertheless
there
was
a
visible
improvement
in
tom
under
this
training
perhaps
because
he
was
not
a
boy
in
the
abstract
existing
solely
to
illustrate
the
evils
of
a
mistaken
education
but
a
boy
made
of
flesh
and
blood
with
dispositions
not
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
there
was
a
great
improvement
in
his
bearing
for
example
and
some
credit
on
this
score
was
due
to
poulter
the
village
schoolmaster
who
being
an
old
peninsular
soldier
was
employed
to
drill
tom
a
source
of
high
mutual
pleasure
poulter
who
was
understood
by
the
company
at
the
black
swan
to
have
once
struck
terror
into
the
hearts
of
the
french
was
no
longer
personally
formidable
he
had
rather
a
shrunken
appearance
and
was
tremulous
in
the
mornings
not
from
age
but
from
the
extreme
perversity
of
the
king
lorton
boys
which
nothing
but
gin
could
enable
him
to
sustain
with
any
firmness
still
he
carried
himself
with
martial
erectness
had
his
clothes
scrupulously
brushed
and
his
trousers
tightly
strapped
and
on
the
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoons
when
he
came
to
tom
he
was
always
inspired
with
gin
and
old
memories
which
gave
him
an
exceptionally
spirited
air
as
of
a
superannuated
charger
who
hears
the
drum
the
were
always
protracted
by
episodes
of
warlike
narrative
much
more
interesting
to
tom
than
philip
stories
out
of
the
iliad
for
there
were
no
cannon
in
the
iliad
and
besides
tom
had
felt
some
disgust
on
learning
that
hector
and
achilles
might
possibly
never
have
existed
but
the
duke
of
wellington
was
really
alive
and
bony
had
not
been
long
dead
therefore
poulter
reminiscences
of
the
peninsular
war
were
removed
from
all
suspicion
of
being
mythical
poulter
it
appeared
had
been
a
conspicuous
figure
at
talavera
and
had
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
peculiar
terror
with
which
his
regiment
of
infantry
was
regarded
by
the
enemy
on
afternoons
when
his
memory
was
more
stimulated
than
usual
he
remembered
that
the
duke
of
wellington
had
in
strict
privacy
lest
jealousies
should
be
awakened
expressed
his
esteem
for
that
fine
fellow
poulter
the
very
surgeon
who
attended
him
in
the
hospital
after
he
had
received
his
had
been
profoundly
impressed
with
the
superiority
of
poulter
flesh
no
other
flesh
would
have
healed
in
anything
like
the
same
time
on
less
personal
matters
connected
with
the
important
warfare
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
poulter
was
more
reticent
only
taking
care
not
to
give
the
weight
of
his
authority
to
any
loose
notions
concerning
military
history
any
one
who
pretended
to
a
knowledge
of
what
occurred
at
the
siege
of
badajos
was
especially
an
object
of
silent
pity
to
poulter
he
wished
that
prating
person
had
been
run
down
and
had
the
breath
trampled
out
of
him
at
the
first
as
he
himself
had
he
might
talk
about
the
siege
of
badajos
then
tom
did
not
escape
irritating
his
occasionally
by
his
curiosity
concerning
other
military
matters
than
personal
experience
and
general
wolfe
poulter
was
he
a
wonderful
fighter
said
tom
who
held
the
notion
that
all
the
martial
heroes
commemorated
on
the
signs
were
engaged
in
the
war
with
bony
not
at
all
said
poulter
contemptuously
nothing
o
the
sort
heads
up
he
added
in
a
tone
of
stern
command
which
delighted
tom
and
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
a
regiment
in
his
own
person
no
no
poulter
would
continue
on
coming
to
a
pause
in
his
discipline
they
better
not
talk
to
me
about
general
wolfe
he
did
nothing
but
die
of
his
wound
that
a
poor
haction
i
consider
any
other
man
have
died
o
the
wounds
i
had
one
of
my
ha
killed
a
fellow
like
general
wolfe
poulter
tom
would
say
at
any
allusion
to
the
sword
i
wish
you
bring
your
sword
and
do
the
for
a
long
while
poulter
only
shook
his
head
in
a
significant
manner
at
this
request
and
smiled
patronizingly
as
jupiter
may
have
done
when
semele
urged
her
too
ambitious
request
but
one
afternoon
when
a
sudden
shower
of
heavy
rain
had
detained
poulter
twenty
minutes
longer
than
usual
at
the
black
swan
the
sword
was
brought
just
for
tom
to
look
at
and
this
is
the
real
sword
you
fought
with
in
all
the
battles
mr
poulter
said
tom
handling
the
hilt
has
it
ever
cut
a
head
off
head
off
ah
and
would
if
he
had
three
heads
but
you
had
a
gun
and
bayonet
besides
said
tom
should
like
the
gun
and
bayonet
best
because
you
could
shoot
first
and
spear
after
bang
tom
gave
the
requisite
pantomime
to
indicate
the
double
enjoyment
of
pulling
the
trigger
and
thrusting
the
spear
ah
but
the
sword
the
thing
when
you
come
to
close
fighting
said
poulter
involuntarily
falling
in
with
tom
enthusiasm
and
drawing
the
sword
so
suddenly
that
tom
leaped
back
with
much
agility
oh
but
poulter
if
you
going
to
do
the
exercise
said
tom
a
little
conscious
that
he
had
not
stood
his
ground
as
became
an
englishman
let
me
go
and
call
philip
he
like
to
see
you
you
know
what
the
humpbacked
lad
said
poulter
contemptuously
the
use
of
looking
on
oh
but
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
fighting
said
tom
and
how
they
used
to
fight
with
bows
and
arrows
and
let
him
come
then
i
show
him
something
different
from
his
bows
and
arrows
said
poulter
coughing
and
drawing
himself
up
while
he
gave
a
little
preliminary
play
to
his
wrist
tom
ran
in
to
philip
who
was
enjoying
his
afternoon
holiday
at
the
piano
in
the
picking
out
tunes
for
himself
and
singing
them
he
was
supremely
happy
perched
like
an
amorphous
bundle
on
the
high
stool
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
cornice
and
his
lips
wide
open
sending
forth
with
all
his
might
impromptu
syllables
to
a
tune
of
arne
which
had
hit
his
fancy
come
philip
said
tom
bursting
in
do
stay
roaring
there
come
and
see
old
poulter
do
his
in
the
the
jar
of
this
interruption
the
discord
of
tom
tones
coming
across
the
notes
to
which
philip
was
vibrating
in
soul
and
body
would
have
been
enough
to
unhinge
his
temper
even
if
there
had
been
no
question
of
poulter
the
and
tom
in
the
hurry
of
seizing
something
to
say
to
prevent
poulter
from
thinking
he
was
afraid
of
the
sword
when
he
sprang
away
from
it
had
alighted
on
this
proposition
to
fetch
philip
though
he
knew
well
enough
that
philip
hated
to
hear
him
mention
his
tom
would
never
have
done
so
inconsiderate
a
thing
except
under
the
severe
stress
of
his
personal
pride
philip
shuddered
visibly
as
he
paused
from
his
music
then
turning
red
he
said
with
violent
passion
get
away
you
lumbering
idiot
do
come
bellowing
at
me
you
not
fit
to
speak
to
anything
but
a
it
was
not
the
first
time
philip
had
been
made
angry
by
him
but
tom
had
never
before
been
assailed
with
verbal
missiles
that
he
understood
so
well
i
fit
to
speak
to
something
better
than
you
you
imp
said
tom
lighting
up
immediately
at
philip
fire
you
know
i
wo
hit
you
because
you
no
better
than
a
girl
but
i
an
honest
man
son
and
father
a
rogue
everybody
says
so
tom
flung
out
of
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
after
him
made
strangely
heedless
by
his
anger
for
to
slam
doors
within
the
hearing
of
stelling
who
was
probably
not
far
off
was
an
offence
only
to
be
wiped
out
by
twenty
lines
of
virgil
in
fact
that
lady
did
presently
descend
from
her
room
in
double
wonder
at
the
noise
and
the
subsequent
cessation
of
philip
music
she
found
him
sitting
in
a
heap
on
the
hassock
and
crying
bitterly
what
the
matter
wakem
what
was
that
noise
about
who
slammed
the
door
philip
looked
up
and
hastily
dried
his
eyes
it
was
tulliver
who
came
in
to
ask
me
to
go
out
with
him
and
what
are
you
in
trouble
about
said
stelling
philip
was
not
her
favorite
of
the
two
pupils
he
was
less
obliging
than
tom
who
was
made
useful
in
many
ways
still
his
father
paid
more
than
tulliver
did
and
she
meant
him
to
feel
that
she
behaved
exceedingly
well
to
him
philip
however
met
her
advances
toward
a
good
understanding
very
much
as
a
caressed
mollusk
meets
an
invitation
to
show
himself
out
of
his
shell
stelling
was
not
a
loving
woman
she
was
a
woman
whose
skirt
sat
well
who
adjusted
her
waist
and
patted
her
curls
with
a
preoccupied
air
when
she
inquired
after
your
welfare
these
things
doubtless
represent
a
great
social
power
but
it
is
not
the
power
of
love
and
no
other
power
could
win
philip
from
his
personal
reserve
he
said
in
answer
to
her
question
my
toothache
came
on
and
made
me
hysterical
again
this
had
been
the
fact
once
and
philip
was
glad
of
the
recollection
it
was
like
an
inspiration
to
enable
him
to
excuse
his
crying
he
had
to
accept
and
to
refuse
creosote
in
consequence
but
that
was
easy
meanwhile
tom
who
had
for
the
first
time
sent
a
poisoned
arrow
into
philip
heart
had
returned
to
the
where
he
found
poulter
with
a
fixed
and
earnest
eye
wasting
the
perfections
of
his
on
probably
observant
but
inappreciative
rats
but
poulter
was
a
host
in
himself
that
is
to
say
he
admired
himself
more
than
a
whole
army
of
spectators
could
have
admired
him
he
took
no
notice
of
tom
return
being
too
entirely
absorbed
in
the
cut
and
thrust
the
solemn
one
two
three
four
and
tom
not
without
a
slight
feeling
of
alarm
at
poulter
fixed
eye
and
sword
which
seemed
impatient
for
something
else
to
cut
besides
the
air
admired
the
performance
from
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
it
was
not
until
poulter
paused
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
that
tom
felt
the
full
charm
of
the
and
wished
it
to
be
repeated
poulter
said
tom
when
the
sword
was
being
finally
sheathed
i
wish
you
lend
me
your
sword
a
little
while
to
keep
no
no
young
gentleman
said
poulter
shaking
his
head
decidedly
you
might
do
yourself
some
mischief
with
it
no
i
sure
i
would
i
sure
i
take
care
and
not
hurt
myself
i
should
take
it
out
of
the
sheath
much
but
i
could
ground
arms
with
it
and
all
that
no
no
it
wo
do
i
tell
you
it
wo
do
said
poulter
preparing
to
depart
what
stelling
say
to
me
oh
i
say
do
poulter
i
give
you
my
piece
if
you
let
me
keep
the
sword
a
week
look
here
said
tom
reaching
out
the
attractively
large
round
of
silver
the
young
dog
calculated
the
effect
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
a
philosopher
well
said
poulter
with
still
deeper
gravity
you
must
keep
it
out
of
sight
you
know
oh
yes
i
keep
it
under
the
bed
said
tom
eagerly
or
else
at
the
bottom
of
my
large
box
and
let
me
see
now
whether
you
can
draw
it
out
of
the
sheath
without
hurting
yourself
that
process
having
been
gone
through
more
than
once
poulter
felt
that
he
had
acted
with
scrupulous
conscientiousness
and
said
well
now
master
tulliver
if
i
take
the
it
is
to
make
sure
as
you
do
no
mischief
with
the
sword
oh
no
indeed
poulter
said
tom
delightedly
handing
him
the
and
grasping
the
sword
which
he
thought
might
have
been
lighter
with
advantage
but
if
stelling
catches
you
carrying
it
in
said
poulter
pocketing
the
provisionally
while
he
raised
this
new
doubt
oh
he
always
keeps
in
his
upstairs
study
on
saturday
afternoon
said
tom
who
disliked
anything
sneaking
but
was
not
disinclined
to
a
little
stratagem
in
a
worthy
cause
so
he
carried
off
the
sword
in
triumph
mixed
with
dread
dread
that
he
might
encounter
or
stelling
to
his
bedroom
where
after
some
consideration
he
hid
it
in
the
closet
behind
some
hanging
clothes
that
night
he
fell
asleep
in
the
thought
that
he
would
astonish
maggie
with
it
when
she
came
tie
it
round
his
waist
with
his
red
comforter
and
make
her
believe
that
the
sword
was
his
own
and
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
soldier
there
was
nobody
but
maggie
who
would
be
silly
enough
to
believe
him
or
whom
he
dared
allow
to
know
he
had
a
sword
and
maggie
was
really
coming
next
week
to
see
tom
before
she
went
to
a
with
lucy
if
you
think
a
lad
of
thirteen
would
have
been
so
childish
you
must
be
an
exceptionally
wise
man
who
although
you
are
devoted
to
a
civil
calling
requiring
you
to
look
bland
rather
than
formidable
yet
never
since
you
had
a
beard
threw
yourself
into
a
martial
attitude
and
frowned
before
the
it
is
doubtful
whether
our
soldiers
would
be
maintained
if
there
were
not
pacific
people
at
home
who
like
to
fancy
themselves
soldiers
war
like
other
dramatic
spectacles
might
possibly
cease
for
want
of
a
public
chapter
v
maggie
second
visit
this
last
breach
between
the
two
lads
was
not
readily
mended
and
for
some
time
they
spoke
to
each
other
no
more
than
was
necessary
their
natural
antipathy
of
temperament
made
resentment
an
easy
passage
to
hatred
and
in
philip
the
transition
seemed
to
have
begun
there
was
no
malignity
in
his
disposition
but
there
was
a
susceptibility
that
made
him
peculiarly
liable
to
a
strong
sense
of
repulsion
the
ox
we
may
venture
to
assert
it
on
the
authority
of
a
great
classic
is
not
given
to
use
his
teeth
as
an
instrument
of
attack
and
tom
was
an
excellent
bovine
lad
who
ran
at
questionable
objects
in
a
truly
ingenious
bovine
manner
but
he
had
blundered
on
philip
tenderest
point
and
had
caused
him
as
much
acute
pain
as
if
he
had
studied
the
means
with
the
nicest
precision
and
the
most
envenomed
spite
tom
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
not
make
up
this
quarrel
as
they
had
done
many
others
by
behaving
as
if
nothing
had
happened
for
though
he
had
never
before
said
to
philip
that
his
father
was
a
rogue
this
idea
had
so
habitually
made
part
of
his
feeling
as
to
the
relation
between
himself
and
his
dubious
schoolfellow
who
he
could
neither
like
nor
dislike
that
the
mere
utterance
did
not
make
such
an
epoch
to
him
as
it
did
to
philip
and
he
had
a
right
to
say
so
when
philip
hectored
over
and
called
him
names
but
perceiving
that
his
first
advances
toward
amity
were
not
met
he
relapsed
into
his
least
favorable
disposition
toward
philip
and
resolved
never
to
appeal
to
him
either
about
drawing
or
exercise
again
they
were
only
so
far
civil
to
each
other
as
was
necessary
to
prevent
their
state
of
feud
from
being
observed
by
stelling
who
would
have
put
down
such
nonsense
with
great
vigor
when
maggie
came
however
she
could
not
help
looking
with
growing
interest
at
the
new
schoolfellow
although
he
was
the
son
of
that
wicked
lawyer
wakem
who
made
her
father
so
angry
she
had
arrived
in
the
middle
of
and
had
sat
by
while
philip
went
through
his
lessons
with
stelling
tom
some
weeks
ago
had
sent
her
word
that
philip
knew
no
end
of
stories
not
stupid
stories
like
hers
and
she
was
convinced
now
from
her
own
observation
that
he
must
be
very
clever
she
hoped
he
would
think
rather
clever
too
when
she
came
to
talk
to
him
maggie
moreover
had
rather
a
tenderness
for
deformed
things
she
preferred
the
lambs
because
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
lambs
which
were
quite
strong
and
well
made
mind
so
much
about
being
petted
and
she
was
especially
fond
of
petting
objects
that
would
think
it
very
delightful
to
be
petted
by
her
she
loved
tom
very
dearly
but
she
often
wished
that
he
more
about
her
loving
him
i
think
philip
wakem
seems
a
nice
boy
tom
she
said
when
they
went
out
of
the
study
together
into
the
garden
to
pass
the
interval
before
dinner
he
could
choose
his
father
you
know
and
i
read
of
very
bad
men
who
had
good
sons
as
well
as
good
parents
who
had
bad
children
and
if
philip
is
good
i
think
we
ought
to
be
the
more
sorry
for
him
because
his
father
is
not
a
good
man
like
him
you
oh
he
a
queer
fellow
said
tom
curtly
and
he
as
sulky
as
can
be
with
me
because
i
told
him
his
father
was
a
rogue
and
i
a
right
to
tell
him
so
for
it
was
true
and
began
it
with
calling
me
names
but
you
stop
here
by
yourself
a
bit
maggie
will
you
i
got
something
i
want
to
do
upstairs
ca
i
go
too
said
maggie
who
in
this
first
day
of
meeting
again
loved
tom
shadow
no
it
something
i
tell
you
about
not
yet
said
tom
skipping
away
in
the
afternoon
the
boys
were
at
their
books
in
the
study
preparing
the
morrow
lesson
that
they
might
have
a
holiday
in
the
evening
in
honor
of
maggie
arrival
tom
was
hanging
over
his
latin
grammar
moving
his
lips
inaudibly
like
a
strict
but
impatient
catholic
repeating
his
tale
of
paternosters
and
philip
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
busy
with
two
volumes
with
a
look
of
contented
diligence
that
excited
maggie
curiosity
he
did
not
look
at
all
as
if
he
were
learning
a
lesson
she
sat
on
a
low
stool
at
nearly
a
right
angle
with
the
two
boys
watching
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
philip
looking
off
his
book
once
toward
the
caught
the
pair
of
questioning
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
him
he
thought
this
sister
of
tulliver
seemed
a
nice
little
thing
quite
unlike
her
brother
he
wished
had
a
little
sister
what
was
it
he
wondered
that
made
maggie
dark
eyes
remind
him
of
the
stories
about
princesses
being
turned
into
animals
i
think
it
was
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
unsatisfied
intelligence
and
unsatisfied
beseeching
affection
i
say
magsie
said
tom
at
last
shutting
his
books
and
putting
them
away
with
the
energy
and
decision
of
a
perfect
master
in
the
art
of
leaving
off
i
done
my
lessons
now
come
upstairs
with
me
what
is
it
said
maggie
when
they
were
outside
the
door
a
slight
suspicion
crossing
her
mind
as
she
remembered
tom
preliminary
visit
upstairs
it
is
a
trick
you
going
to
play
me
now
no
no
maggie
said
tom
in
his
most
coaxing
tone
it
something
you
like
he
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
she
put
hers
round
his
waist
and
twined
together
in
this
way
they
went
upstairs
i
say
magsie
you
must
not
tell
anybody
you
know
said
tom
else
i
shall
get
fifty
lines
is
it
alive
said
maggie
whose
imagination
had
settled
for
the
moment
on
the
idea
that
tom
kept
a
ferret
clandestinely
oh
i
tell
you
said
he
now
you
go
into
that
corner
and
hide
your
face
while
i
reach
it
out
he
added
as
he
locked
the
bedroom
door
behind
them
i
tell
you
when
to
turn
round
you
must
squeal
out
you
know
oh
but
if
you
frighten
me
i
shall
said
maggie
beginning
to
look
rather
serious
you
wo
be
frightened
you
silly
thing
said
tom
go
and
hide
your
face
and
mind
you
do
peep
of
course
i
peep
said
maggie
disdainfully
and
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
like
a
person
of
strict
honor
but
tom
looked
round
warily
as
he
walked
to
the
closet
then
he
stepped
into
the
narrow
space
and
almost
closed
the
door
maggie
kept
her
face
buried
without
the
aid
of
principle
for
in
that
attitude
she
had
soon
forgotten
where
she
was
and
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
poor
deformed
boy
who
was
so
clever
when
tom
called
out
now
then
magsie
nothing
but
long
meditation
and
preconcerted
arrangement
of
effects
would
have
enabled
tom
to
present
so
striking
a
figure
as
he
did
to
maggie
when
she
looked
up
dissatisfied
with
the
pacific
aspect
of
a
face
which
had
no
more
than
the
faintest
hint
of
flaxen
eyebrow
together
with
a
pair
of
amiable
eyes
and
round
pink
cheeks
that
refused
to
look
formidable
let
him
frown
as
he
would
before
the
philip
had
once
told
him
of
a
man
who
had
a
horseshoe
frown
and
tom
had
tried
with
all
his
frowning
might
to
make
a
horseshoe
on
his
forehead
he
had
had
recourse
to
that
unfailing
source
of
the
terrible
burnt
cork
and
had
made
himself
a
pair
of
black
eyebrows
that
met
in
a
satisfactory
manner
over
his
nose
and
were
matched
by
a
less
carefully
adjusted
blackness
about
the
chin
he
had
wound
a
red
handkerchief
round
his
cloth
cap
to
give
it
the
air
of
a
turban
and
his
red
comforter
across
his
breast
as
a
scarf
an
amount
of
red
which
with
the
tremendous
frown
on
his
brow
and
the
decision
with
which
he
grasped
the
sword
as
he
held
it
with
its
point
resting
on
the
ground
would
suffice
to
convey
an
approximate
idea
of
his
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
disposition
maggie
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
and
tom
enjoyed
that
moment
keenly
but
in
the
next
she
laughed
clapped
her
hands
together
and
said
oh
tom
you
made
yourself
like
bluebeard
at
the
show
it
was
clear
she
had
not
been
struck
with
the
presence
of
the
sword
it
was
not
unsheathed
her
frivolous
mind
required
a
more
direct
appeal
to
its
sense
of
the
terrible
and
tom
prepared
for
his
frowning
with
a
double
amount
of
intention
if
not
of
corrugation
he
carefully
drew
the
sword
from
its
sheath
and
pointed
it
at
maggie
oh
tom
please
do
exclaimed
maggie
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
dread
shrinking
away
from
him
into
the
opposite
corner
i
scream
i
sure
i
shall
oh
do
i
wish
i
never
come
upstairs
the
corners
of
tom
mouth
showed
an
inclination
to
a
smile
of
complacency
that
was
immediately
checked
as
inconsistent
with
the
severity
of
a
great
warrior
slowly
he
let
down
the
scabbard
on
the
floor
lest
it
should
make
too
much
noise
and
then
said
sternly
i
the
duke
of
wellington
march
stamping
forward
with
the
right
leg
a
little
bent
and
the
sword
still
pointing
toward
maggie
who
trembling
and
with
eyes
got
upon
the
bed
as
the
only
means
of
widening
the
space
between
them
tom
happy
in
this
spectator
of
his
military
performances
even
though
the
spectator
was
only
maggie
proceeded
with
the
utmost
exertion
of
his
force
to
such
an
exhibition
of
the
cut
and
thrust
as
would
necessarily
be
expected
of
the
duke
of
wellington
tom
i
bear
it
i
scream
said
maggie
at
the
first
movement
of
the
sword
you
hurt
yourself
you
cut
your
head
off
one
two
said
tom
resolutely
though
at
two
his
wrist
trembled
a
little
three
came
more
slowly
and
with
it
the
sword
swung
downward
and
maggie
gave
a
loud
shriek
the
sword
had
fallen
with
its
edge
on
tom
foot
and
in
a
moment
after
he
had
fallen
too
maggie
leaped
from
the
bed
still
shrieking
and
immediately
there
was
a
rush
of
footsteps
toward
the
room
stelling
from
his
upstairs
study
was
the
first
to
enter
he
found
both
the
children
on
the
floor
tom
had
fainted
and
maggie
was
shaking
him
by
the
collar
of
his
jacket
screaming
with
wild
eyes
she
thought
he
was
dead
poor
child
and
yet
she
shook
him
as
if
that
would
bring
him
back
to
life
in
another
minute
she
was
sobbing
with
joy
because
tom
opened
his
eyes
she
could
sorrow
yet
that
he
had
hurt
his
foot
it
seemed
as
if
all
happiness
lay
in
his
being
alive
chapter
vi
a
poor
tom
bore
his
severe
pain
heroically
and
was
resolute
in
not
telling
of
poulter
more
than
was
unavoidable
the
piece
remained
a
secret
even
to
maggie
but
there
was
a
terrible
dread
weighing
on
his
mind
so
terrible
that
he
dared
not
even
ask
the
question
which
might
bring
the
fatal
yes
he
dared
not
ask
the
surgeon
or
stelling
shall
i
be
lame
sir
he
mastered
himself
so
as
not
to
cry
out
at
the
pain
but
when
his
foot
had
been
dressed
and
he
was
left
alone
with
maggie
seated
by
his
bedside
the
children
sobbed
together
with
their
heads
laid
on
the
same
pillow
tom
was
thinking
of
himself
walking
about
on
crutches
like
the
son
and
maggie
who
did
not
guess
what
was
in
his
mind
sobbed
for
company
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
surgeon
or
to
stelling
to
anticipate
this
dread
in
tom
mind
and
to
reassure
him
by
hopeful
words
but
philip
watched
the
surgeon
out
of
the
house
and
waylaid
stelling
to
ask
the
very
question
that
tom
had
not
dared
to
ask
for
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
does
askern
say
tulliver
will
be
lame
oh
no
oh
no
said
stelling
not
permanently
only
for
a
little
while
did
he
tell
tulliver
so
sir
do
you
think
no
nothing
was
said
to
him
on
the
subject
then
may
i
go
and
tell
him
sir
yes
to
be
sure
now
you
mention
it
i
dare
say
he
may
be
troubling
about
that
go
to
his
bedroom
but
be
very
quiet
at
present
it
had
been
philip
first
thought
when
he
heard
of
the
accident
will
tulliver
be
lame
it
will
be
very
hard
for
him
if
he
is
and
tom
hitherto
unforgiven
offences
were
washed
out
by
that
pity
philip
felt
that
they
were
no
longer
in
a
state
of
repulsion
but
were
being
drawn
into
a
common
current
of
suffering
and
sad
privation
his
imagination
did
not
dwell
on
the
outward
calamity
and
its
future
effect
on
tom
life
but
it
made
vividly
present
to
him
the
probable
state
of
tom
feeling
philip
had
only
lived
fourteen
years
but
those
years
had
most
of
them
been
steeped
in
the
sense
of
a
lot
irremediably
hard
askern
says
you
soon
be
all
right
again
tulliver
did
you
know
he
said
rather
timidly
as
he
stepped
gently
up
to
tom
bed
i
just
been
to
ask
stelling
and
he
says
you
walk
as
well
as
ever
again
tom
looked
up
with
that
momentary
stopping
of
the
breath
which
comes
with
a
sudden
joy
then
he
gave
a
long
sigh
and
turned
his
eyes
straight
on
philip
face
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
fortnight
or
more
as
for
maggie
this
intimation
of
a
possibility
she
had
not
thought
of
before
affected
her
as
a
new
trouble
the
bare
idea
of
tom
being
always
lame
overpowered
the
assurance
that
such
a
misfortune
was
not
likely
to
befall
him
and
she
clung
to
him
and
cried
afresh
do
be
a
little
silly
magsie
said
tom
tenderly
feeling
very
brave
now
i
shall
soon
get
well
tulliver
said
philip
putting
out
his
small
delicate
hand
which
tom
clasped
immediately
with
his
more
substantial
fingers
i
say
said
tom
ask
stelling
to
let
you
come
and
sit
with
me
sometimes
till
i
get
up
again
wakem
and
tell
me
about
robert
bruce
you
know
after
that
philip
spent
all
his
time
out
of
with
tom
and
maggie
tom
liked
to
hear
fighting
stories
as
much
as
ever
but
he
insisted
strongly
on
the
fact
that
those
great
fighters
who
did
so
many
wonderful
things
and
came
off
unhurt
wore
excellent
armor
from
head
to
foot
which
made
fighting
easy
work
he
considered
he
should
not
have
hurt
his
foot
if
he
had
had
an
iron
shoe
on
he
listened
with
great
interest
to
a
new
story
of
philip
about
a
man
who
had
a
very
bad
wound
in
his
foot
and
cried
out
so
dreadfully
with
the
pain
that
his
friends
could
bear
with
him
no
longer
but
put
him
ashore
on
a
desert
island
with
nothing
but
some
wonderful
poisoned
arrows
to
kill
animals
with
for
food
i
did
roar
out
a
bit
you
know
tom
said
and
i
dare
say
my
foot
was
as
bad
as
his
it
cowardly
to
roar
but
maggie
would
have
it
that
when
anything
hurt
you
very
much
it
was
quite
permissible
to
cry
out
and
it
was
cruel
of
people
not
to
bear
it
she
wanted
to
know
if
philoctetes
had
a
sister
and
why
did
go
with
him
on
the
desert
island
and
take
care
of
him
one
day
soon
after
philip
had
told
this
story
he
and
maggie
were
in
the
study
alone
together
while
tom
foot
was
being
dressed
philip
was
at
his
books
and
maggie
after
sauntering
idly
round
the
room
not
caring
to
do
anything
in
particular
because
she
would
soon
go
to
tom
again
went
and
leaned
on
the
table
near
philip
to
see
what
he
was
doing
for
they
were
quite
old
friends
now
and
perfectly
at
home
with
each
other
what
are
you
reading
about
in
greek
she
said
it
poetry
i
can
see
that
because
the
lines
are
so
short
it
about
philoctetes
the
lame
man
i
was
telling
you
of
yesterday
he
answered
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looking
at
her
as
if
he
were
not
at
all
sorry
to
be
interrupted
maggie
in
her
absent
way
continued
to
lean
forward
resting
on
her
arms
and
moving
her
feet
about
while
her
dark
eyes
got
more
and
more
fixed
and
vacant
as
if
she
had
quite
forgotten
philip
and
his
book
maggie
said
philip
after
a
minute
or
two
still
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
looking
at
her
if
you
had
had
a
brother
like
me
do
you
think
you
should
have
loved
him
as
well
as
tom
maggie
started
a
little
on
being
roused
from
her
reverie
and
said
what
philip
repeated
his
question
oh
yes
better
she
answered
immediately
no
not
better
because
i
do
think
i
love
you
better
than
tom
but
i
should
be
so
sorry
for
you
philip
colored
he
had
meant
to
imply
would
she
love
him
as
well
in
spite
of
his
deformity
and
yet
when
she
alluded
to
it
so
plainly
he
winced
under
her
pity
maggie
young
as
she
was
felt
her
mistake
hitherto
she
had
instinctively
behaved
as
if
she
were
quite
unconscious
of
philip
deformity
her
own
keen
sensitiveness
and
experience
under
family
criticism
sufficed
to
teach
her
this
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
directed
by
the
most
finished
breeding
but
you
are
so
very
clever
philip
and
you
can
play
and
sing
she
added
quickly
i
wish
you
my
brother
i
very
fond
of
you
and
you
would
stay
at
home
with
me
when
tom
went
out
and
you
would
teach
me
everything
would
you
greek
and
everything
but
you
go
away
soon
and
go
to
school
maggie
said
philip
and
then
you
forget
all
about
me
and
not
care
for
me
any
more
and
then
i
shall
see
you
when
you
grown
up
and
you
hardly
take
any
notice
of
me
oh
no
i
forget
you
i
sure
said
maggie
shaking
her
head
very
seriously
i
never
forget
anything
and
i
think
about
everybody
when
i
away
from
them
i
think
about
poor
yap
he
got
a
lump
in
his
throat
and
luke
says
he
die
only
do
you
tell
tom
because
it
will
vex
him
so
you
never
saw
yap
he
a
queer
little
dog
nobody
cares
about
him
but
tom
and
me
do
you
care
as
much
about
me
as
you
do
about
yap
maggie
said
philip
smiling
rather
sadly
oh
yes
i
should
think
so
said
maggie
laughing
i
very
fond
of
maggie
i
shall
never
forget
said
philip
and
when
i
very
unhappy
i
shall
always
think
of
you
and
wish
i
had
a
sister
with
dark
eyes
just
like
yours
why
do
you
like
my
eyes
said
maggie
well
pleased
she
had
never
heard
any
one
but
her
father
speak
of
her
eyes
as
if
they
had
merit
i
do
know
said
philip
they
not
like
any
other
eyes
they
seem
trying
to
speak
trying
to
speak
kindly
i
do
like
other
people
to
look
at
me
much
but
i
like
you
to
look
at
me
maggie
why
i
think
you
fonder
of
me
than
tom
is
said
maggie
rather
sorrowfully
then
wondering
how
she
could
convince
philip
that
she
could
like
him
just
as
well
although
he
was
crooked
she
said
should
you
like
me
to
kiss
you
as
i
do
tom
i
will
if
you
like
yes
very
much
nobody
kisses
me
maggie
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
quite
earnestly
there
now
she
said
i
shall
always
remember
you
and
kiss
you
when
i
see
you
again
if
it
ever
so
long
but
i
go
now
because
i
think
askern
done
with
tom
foot
when
their
father
came
the
second
time
maggie
said
to
him
oh
father
philip
wakem
is
so
very
good
to
tom
he
is
such
a
clever
boy
and
i
love
him
and
you
love
him
too
tom
do
you
you
love
him
she
added
entreatingly
tom
colored
a
little
as
he
looked
at
his
father
and
said
i
be
friends
with
him
when
i
leave
school
father
but
we
made
it
up
now
since
my
foot
has
been
bad
and
he
taught
me
to
play
at
draughts
and
i
can
beat
him
well
well
said
tulliver
if
he
good
to
you
try
and
make
him
amends
and
be
good
to
he
a
poor
crooked
creature
and
takes
after
his
dead
mother
but
do
you
be
getting
too
thick
with
him
he
got
his
father
blood
in
him
too
ay
ay
the
gray
colt
may
chance
to
kick
like
his
black
sire
the
jarring
natures
of
the
two
boys
effected
what
admonition
alone
might
have
failed
to
effect
in
spite
of
philip
new
kindness
and
tom
answering
regard
in
this
time
of
his
trouble
they
never
became
close
friends
when
maggie
was
gone
and
when
tom
began
to
walk
about
as
usual
the
friendly
warmth
that
had
been
kindled
by
pity
and
gratitude
died
out
by
degrees
and
left
them
in
their
old
relation
to
each
other
philip
was
often
peevish
and
contemptuous
and
tom
more
specific
and
kindly
impressions
gradually
melted
into
the
old
background
of
suspicion
and
dislike
toward
him
as
a
queer
fellow
a
humpback
and
the
son
of
a
rogue
if
boys
and
men
are
to
be
welded
together
in
the
glow
of
transient
feeling
they
must
be
made
of
metal
that
will
mix
else
they
inevitably
fall
asunder
when
the
heat
dies
out
chapter
vii
the
golden
gates
are
passed
so
tom
went
on
even
to
the
fifth
till
he
was
turned
sixteen
at
king
lorton
while
maggie
was
growing
with
a
rapidity
which
her
aunts
considered
highly
reprehensible
at
miss
in
the
ancient
town
of
laceham
on
the
floss
with
cousin
lucy
for
her
companion
in
her
early
letters
to
tom
she
had
always
sent
her
love
to
philip
and
asked
many
questions
about
him
which
were
answered
by
brief
sentences
about
tom
toothache
and
a
which
he
was
helping
to
build
in
the
garden
with
other
items
of
that
kind
she
was
pained
to
hear
tom
say
in
the
holidays
that
philip
was
as
queer
as
ever
again
and
often
cross
they
were
no
longer
very
good
friends
she
perceived
and
when
she
reminded
tom
that
he
ought
always
to
love
philip
for
being
so
good
to
him
when
his
foot
was
bad
he
answered
well
it
is
my
fault
do
do
anything
to
him
she
hardly
ever
saw
philip
during
the
remainder
of
their
in
the
midsummer
holidays
he
was
always
away
at
the
seaside
and
at
christmas
she
could
only
meet
him
at
long
intervals
in
the
street
of
ogg
when
they
did
meet
she
remembered
her
promise
to
kiss
him
but
as
a
young
lady
who
had
been
at
a
she
knew
now
that
such
a
greeting
was
out
of
the
question
and
philip
would
not
expect
it
the
promise
was
void
like
so
many
other
sweet
illusory
promises
of
our
childhood
void
as
promises
made
in
eden
before
the
seasons
were
divided
and
when
the
starry
blossoms
grew
side
by
side
with
the
ripening
peach
impossible
to
be
fulfilled
when
the
golden
gates
had
been
passed
but
when
their
father
was
actually
engaged
in
the
lawsuit
and
wakem
as
the
agent
at
once
of
pivart
and
old
harry
was
acting
against
him
even
maggie
felt
with
some
sadness
that
they
were
not
likely
ever
to
have
any
intimacy
with
philip
again
the
very
name
of
wakem
made
her
father
angry
and
she
had
once
heard
him
say
that
if
that
son
lived
to
inherit
his
father
gains
there
would
be
a
curse
upon
him
have
as
little
to
do
with
him
at
school
as
you
can
my
lad
he
said
to
tom
and
the
command
was
obeyed
the
more
easily
because
sterling
by
this
time
had
two
additional
pupils
for
though
this
gentleman
rise
in
the
world
was
not
of
that
rapidity
which
the
admirers
of
his
extemporaneous
eloquence
had
expected
for
a
preacher
whose
voice
demanded
so
wide
a
sphere
he
had
yet
enough
of
growing
prosperity
to
enable
him
to
increase
his
expenditure
in
continued
disproportion
to
his
income
as
for
tom
school
course
it
went
on
with
monotony
his
mind
continuing
to
move
with
a
slow
pulse
in
a
medium
uninteresting
or
unintelligible
ideas
but
each
vacation
he
brought
home
larger
and
larger
drawings
with
the
satiny
rendering
of
landscape
and
in
vivid
greens
together
with
manuscript
books
full
of
exercises
and
problems
in
which
the
handwriting
was
all
the
finer
because
he
gave
his
whole
mind
to
it
each
vacation
he
brought
home
a
new
book
or
two
indicating
his
progress
through
different
stages
of
history
christian
doctrine
and
latin
literature
and
that
passage
was
not
entirely
without
results
besides
the
possession
of
the
books
tom
ear
and
tongue
had
become
accustomed
to
a
great
many
words
and
phrases
which
are
understood
to
be
signs
of
an
educated
condition
and
though
he
had
never
really
applied
his
mind
to
any
one
of
his
lessons
the
lessons
had
left
a
deposit
of
vague
fragmentary
ineffectual
notions
tulliver
seeing
signs
of
acquirement
beyond
the
reach
of
his
own
criticism
thought
it
was
probably
all
right
with
tom
education
he
observed
indeed
that
there
were
no
maps
and
not
enough
summing
but
he
made
no
formal
complaint
to
stelling
it
was
a
puzzling
business
this
schooling
and
if
he
took
tom
away
where
could
he
send
him
with
better
effect
by
the
time
tom
had
reached
his
last
quarter
at
king
lorton
the
years
had
made
striking
changes
in
him
since
the
day
we
saw
him
returning
from
jacobs
academy
he
was
a
tall
youth
now
carrying
himself
without
the
least
awkwardness
and
speaking
without
more
shyness
than
was
a
becoming
symptom
of
blended
diffidence
and
pride
he
wore
his
and
his
collars
and
watched
the
down
on
his
lip
with
eager
impatience
looking
every
day
at
his
virgin
razor
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
in
the
last
holidays
philip
had
already
left
at
the
autumn
quarter
that
he
might
go
to
the
south
for
the
winter
for
the
sake
of
his
health
and
this
change
helped
to
give
tom
the
unsettled
exultant
feeling
that
usually
belongs
to
the
last
months
before
leaving
school
this
quarter
too
there
was
some
hope
of
his
father
lawsuit
being
decided
made
the
prospect
of
home
more
entirely
pleasurable
for
tom
who
had
gathered
his
view
of
the
case
from
his
father
conversation
had
no
doubt
that
pivart
would
be
beaten
tom
had
not
heard
anything
from
home
for
some
weeks
a
fact
which
did
not
surprise
him
for
his
father
and
mother
were
not
apt
to
manifest
their
affection
in
unnecessary
letters
when
to
his
great
surprise
on
the
morning
of
a
dark
cold
day
near
the
end
of
november
he
was
told
soon
after
entering
the
study
at
nine
that
his
sister
was
in
the
it
was
stelling
who
had
come
into
the
study
to
tell
him
and
she
left
him
to
enter
the
alone
maggie
too
was
tall
now
with
braided
and
coiled
hair
she
was
almost
as
tall
as
tom
though
she
was
only
thirteen
and
she
really
looked
older
than
he
did
at
that
moment
she
had
thrown
off
her
bonnet
her
heavy
braids
were
pushed
back
from
her
forehead
as
if
it
would
not
bear
that
extra
load
and
her
young
face
had
a
strangely
worn
look
as
her
eyes
turned
anxiously
toward
the
door
when
tom
entered
she
did
not
speak
but
only
went
up
to
him
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
earnestly
he
was
used
to
various
moods
of
hers
and
felt
no
alarm
at
the
unusual
seriousness
of
her
greeting
why
how
is
it
you
come
so
early
this
cold
morning
maggie
did
you
come
in
the
gig
said
tom
as
she
backed
toward
the
sofa
and
drew
him
to
her
side
no
i
came
by
the
coach
i
walked
from
the
turnpike
but
how
is
it
you
not
at
school
the
holidays
have
not
begun
yet
father
wanted
me
at
home
said
maggie
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lip
i
came
home
three
or
four
days
ago
is
my
father
well
said
tom
rather
anxiously
not
quite
said
maggie
he
very
unhappy
tom
the
lawsuit
is
ended
and
i
came
to
tell
you
because
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
know
it
before
you
came
home
and
i
did
like
only
to
send
you
a
letter
my
father
has
lost
said
tom
hastily
springing
from
the
sofa
and
standing
before
maggie
with
his
hands
suddenly
thrust
into
his
pockets
yes
dear
tom
said
maggie
looking
up
at
him
with
trembling
tom
was
silent
a
minute
or
two
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
then
he
said
my
father
will
have
to
pay
a
good
deal
of
money
then
yes
said
maggie
rather
faintly
well
it
ca
be
helped
said
tom
bravely
not
translating
the
loss
of
a
large
sum
of
money
into
any
tangible
results
but
my
father
very
much
vexed
i
dare
say
he
added
looking
at
maggie
and
thinking
that
her
agitated
face
was
only
part
of
her
girlish
way
of
taking
things
yes
said
maggie
again
faintly
then
urged
to
fuller
speech
by
tom
freedom
from
apprehension
she
said
loudly
and
rapidly
as
if
the
words
burst
from
her
oh
tom
he
will
lose
the
mill
and
the
land
and
everything
he
will
have
nothing
left
tom
eyes
flashed
out
one
look
of
surprise
at
her
before
he
turned
pale
and
trembled
visibly
he
said
nothing
but
sat
down
on
the
sofa
again
looking
vaguely
out
of
the
opposite
window
anxiety
about
the
future
had
never
entered
tom
mind
his
father
had
always
ridden
a
good
horse
kept
a
good
house
and
had
the
cheerful
confident
air
of
a
man
who
has
plenty
of
property
to
fall
back
upon
tom
had
never
dreamed
that
his
father
would
fail
was
a
form
of
misfortune
which
he
had
always
heard
spoken
of
as
a
deep
disgrace
and
disgrace
was
an
idea
that
he
could
not
associate
with
any
of
his
relations
least
of
all
with
his
father
a
proud
sense
of
family
respectability
was
part
of
the
very
air
tom
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
he
knew
there
were
people
in
ogg
who
made
a
show
without
money
to
support
it
and
he
had
always
heard
such
people
spoken
of
by
his
own
friends
with
contempt
and
reprobation
he
had
a
strong
belief
which
was
a
lifelong
habit
and
required
no
definite
evidence
to
rest
on
that
his
father
could
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
if
he
chose
and
since
his
education
at
stelling
had
given
him
a
more
expensive
view
of
life
he
had
often
thought
that
when
he
got
older
he
would
make
a
figure
in
the
world
with
his
horse
and
dogs
and
saddle
and
other
accoutrements
of
a
fine
young
man
and
show
himself
equal
to
any
of
his
contemporaries
at
ogg
who
might
consider
themselves
a
grade
above
him
in
society
because
their
fathers
were
professional
men
or
had
large
as
to
the
prognostics
and
headshaking
of
his
aunts
and
uncles
they
had
never
produced
the
least
effect
on
him
except
to
make
him
think
that
aunts
and
uncles
were
disagreeable
society
he
had
heard
them
find
fault
in
much
the
same
way
as
long
as
he
could
remember
his
father
knew
better
than
they
did
the
down
had
come
on
tom
lip
yet
his
thoughts
and
expectations
had
been
hitherto
only
the
reproduction
in
changed
forms
of
the
boyish
dreams
in
which
he
had
lived
three
years
ago
he
was
awakened
now
with
a
violent
shock
maggie
was
frightened
at
tom
pale
trembling
silence
there
was
something
else
to
tell
him
something
worse
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
at
last
and
said
with
a
half
sob
oh
tom
dear
dear
tom
do
fret
too
much
try
and
bear
it
well
tom
turned
his
cheek
passively
to
meet
her
entreating
kisses
and
there
gathered
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
which
he
just
rubbed
away
with
his
hand
the
action
seemed
to
rouse
him
for
he
shook
himself
and
said
i
shall
go
home
with
you
maggie
did
my
father
say
i
was
to
go
no
tom
father
did
wish
it
said
maggie
her
anxiety
about
feeling
helping
her
to
master
her
agitation
what
he
do
when
she
told
him
all
but
mother
wants
you
to
come
poor
mother
she
cries
so
oh
tom
it
very
dreadful
at
home
maggie
lips
grew
whiter
and
she
began
to
tremble
almost
as
tom
had
done
the
two
poor
things
clung
closer
to
each
other
both
trembling
the
one
at
an
unshapen
fear
the
other
at
the
image
of
a
terrible
certainty
when
maggie
spoke
it
was
hardly
above
a
whisper
and
and
poor
father
maggie
could
not
utter
it
but
the
suspense
was
intolerable
to
tom
a
vague
idea
of
going
to
prison
as
a
consequence
of
debt
was
the
shape
his
fears
had
begun
to
take
where
my
father
he
said
impatiently
me
maggie
he
at
home
said
maggie
finding
it
easier
to
reply
to
that
question
but
she
added
after
a
pause
not
himself
he
fell
off
his
horse
he
has
known
nobody
but
me
ever
since
he
seems
to
have
lost
his
senses
o
father
father
with
these
last
words
maggie
sobs
burst
forth
with
the
more
violence
for
the
previous
struggle
against
them
tom
felt
that
pressure
of
the
heart
which
forbids
tears
he
had
no
distinct
vision
of
their
troubles
as
maggie
had
who
had
been
at
home
he
only
felt
the
crushing
weight
of
what
seemed
unmitigated
misfortune
he
tightened
his
arm
almost
convulsively
round
maggie
as
she
sobbed
but
his
face
looked
rigid
and
tearless
his
eyes
blank
as
if
a
black
curtain
of
cloud
had
suddenly
fallen
on
his
path
but
maggie
soon
checked
herself
abruptly
a
single
thought
had
acted
on
her
like
a
startling
sound
we
must
set
out
tom
we
must
not
stay
father
will
miss
me
we
must
be
at
the
turnpike
at
ten
to
meet
the
coach
she
said
this
with
hasty
decision
rubbing
her
eyes
and
rising
to
seize
her
bonnet
tom
at
once
felt
the
same
impulse
and
rose
too
wait
a
minute
maggie
he
said
i
must
speak
to
stelling
and
then
we
go
he
thought
he
must
go
to
the
study
where
the
pupils
were
but
on
his
way
he
met
stelling
who
had
heard
from
his
wife
that
maggie
appeared
to
be
in
trouble
when
she
asked
for
her
brother
and
now
that
he
thought
the
brother
and
sister
had
been
alone
long
enough
was
coming
to
inquire
and
offer
his
sympathy
please
sir
i
must
go
home
tom
said
abruptly
as
he
met
stelling
in
the
passage
i
must
go
back
with
my
sister
directly
my
father
lost
his
lawsuit
he
lost
all
his
property
and
he
very
stelling
felt
like
a
man
he
foresaw
a
probable
money
loss
for
himself
but
this
had
no
appreciable
share
in
his
feeling
while
he
looked
with
grave
pity
at
the
brother
and
sister
for
whom
youth
and
sorrow
had
begun
together
when
he
knew
how
maggie
had
come
and
how
eager
she
was
to
get
home
again
he
hurried
their
departure
only
whispering
something
to
stelling
who
had
followed
him
and
who
immediately
left
the
room
tom
and
maggie
were
standing
on
the
ready
to
set
out
when
stelling
came
with
a
little
basket
which
she
hung
on
arm
saying
do
remember
to
eat
something
on
the
way
dear
heart
went
out
toward
this
woman
whom
she
had
never
liked
and
she
kissed
her
silently
it
was
the
first
sign
within
the
poor
child
of
that
new
sense
which
is
the
gift
of
sorrow
that
susceptibility
to
the
bare
offices
of
humanity
which
raises
them
into
a
bond
of
loving
fellowship
as
to
haggard
men
among
the
the
mere
presence
of
an
ordinary
comrade
stirs
the
deep
fountains
of
affection
stelling
put
his
hand
on
tom
shoulder
and
said
god
bless
you
my
boy
let
me
know
how
you
get
on
then
he
pressed
maggie
hand
but
there
were
no
audible
tom
had
so
often
thought
how
joyful
he
should
be
the
day
he
left
school
for
good
and
now
his
school
years
seemed
like
a
holiday
that
had
come
to
an
end
the
two
slight
youthful
figures
soon
grew
indistinct
on
the
distant
road
were
soon
lost
behind
the
projecting
hedgerow
they
had
gone
forth
together
into
their
life
of
sorrow
and
they
would
never
more
see
the
sunshine
undimmed
by
remembered
cares
they
had
entered
the
thorny
wilderness
and
the
golden
gates
of
their
childhood
had
forever
closed
behind
them
book

chapter
i
what
had
happened
at
home
when
tulliver
first
knew
the
fact
that
the
lawsuit
was
decided
against
him
and
that
pivart
and
wakem
were
triumphant
every
one
who
happened
to
observe
him
at
the
time
thought
that
for
so
confident
and
a
man
he
bore
the
blow
remarkably
well
he
thought
so
himself
he
thought
he
was
going
to
show
that
if
wakem
or
anybody
else
considered
him
crushed
they
would
find
themselves
mistaken
he
could
not
refuse
to
see
that
the
costs
of
this
protracted
suit
would
take
more
than
he
possessed
to
pay
them
but
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
full
of
expedients
by
which
he
could
ward
off
any
results
but
such
as
were
tolerable
and
could
avoid
the
appearance
of
breaking
down
in
the
world
all
the
obstinacy
and
defiance
of
his
nature
driven
out
of
their
old
channel
found
a
vent
for
themselves
in
the
immediate
formation
of
plans
by
which
he
would
meet
his
difficulties
and
remain
tulliver
of
dorlcote
mill
in
spite
of
them
there
was
such
a
rush
of
projects
in
his
brain
that
it
was
no
wonder
his
face
was
flushed
when
he
came
away
from
his
talk
with
his
attorney
gore
and
mounted
his
horse
to
ride
home
from
lindum
there
was
furley
who
held
the
mortgage
on
the
land
a
reasonable
fellow
who
would
see
his
own
interest
tulliver
was
convinced
and
who
would
be
glad
not
only
to
purchase
the
whole
estate
including
the
mill
and
homestead
but
would
accept
tulliver
as
tenant
and
be
willing
to
advance
money
to
be
repaid
with
high
interest
out
of
the
profits
of
the
business
which
would
be
made
over
to
him
tulliver
only
taking
enough
barely
to
maintain
himself
and
his
family
who
would
neglect
such
a
profitable
investment
certainly
not
furley
for
tulliver
had
determined
that
furley
should
meet
his
plans
with
the
utmost
alacrity
and
there
are
men
whoses
brains
have
not
yet
been
dangerously
heated
by
the
loss
of
a
lawsuit
who
are
apt
to
see
in
their
own
interest
or
desires
a
motive
for
other
men
actions
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
miller
mind
that
furley
would
do
just
what
was
desirable
and
if
he
did
why
things
would
not
be
so
very
much
worse
tulliver
and
his
family
must
live
more
meagrely
and
humbly
but
it
would
only
be
till
the
profits
of
the
business
had
paid
off
furley
advances
and
that
might
be
while
tulliver
had
still
a
good
many
years
of
life
before
him
it
was
clear
that
the
costs
of
the
suit
could
be
paid
without
his
being
obliged
to
turn
out
of
his
old
place
and
look
like
a
ruined
man
it
was
certainly
an
awkward
moment
in
his
affairs
there
was
that
suretyship
for
poor
riley
who
had
died
suddenly
last
april
and
left
his
friend
saddled
with
a
debt
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
fact
which
had
helped
to
make
tulliver
banking
book
less
pleasant
reading
than
a
man
might
desire
toward
christmas
well
he
had
never
been
one
of
those
sneaks
who
would
refuse
to
give
a
helping
hand
to
a
in
this
puzzling
world
the
really
vexatious
business
was
the
fact
that
some
months
ago
the
creditor
who
had
lent
him
the
five
hundred
pounds
to
repay
glegg
had
become
uneasy
about
his
money
set
on
by
wakem
of
course
and
tulliver
still
confident
that
he
should
gain
his
suit
and
finding
it
eminently
inconvenient
to
raise
the
said
sum
until
that
desirable
issue
had
taken
place
had
rashly
acceded
to
the
demand
that
he
should
give
a
bill
of
sale
on
his
household
furniture
and
some
other
effects
as
security
in
lieu
of
the
bond
it
was
all
one
he
had
said
to
himself
he
should
soon
pay
off
the
money
and
there
was
no
harm
in
giving
that
security
any
more
than
another
but
now
the
consequences
of
this
bill
of
sale
occurred
to
him
in
a
new
light
and
he
remembered
that
the
time
was
close
at
hand
when
it
would
be
enforced
unless
the
money
were
repaid
two
months
ago
he
would
have
declared
stoutly
that
he
would
never
be
beholden
to
his
friends
but
now
he
told
himself
as
stoutly
that
it
was
nothing
but
right
and
natural
that
bessy
should
go
to
the
pullets
and
explain
the
thing
to
them
they
would
hardly
let
bessy
furniture
be
sold
and
it
might
be
security
to
pullet
if
he
advanced
the
money
there
would
after
all
be
no
gift
or
favor
in
the
matter
tulliver
would
never
have
asked
for
anything
from
so
a
fellow
for
himself
but
bessy
might
do
so
if
she
liked
it
is
precisely
the
proudest
and
most
obstinate
men
who
are
the
most
liable
to
shift
their
position
and
contradict
themselves
in
this
sudden
manner
everything
is
easier
to
them
than
to
face
the
simple
fact
that
they
have
been
thoroughly
defeated
and
must
begin
life
anew
and
tulliver
you
perceive
though
nothing
more
than
a
superior
miller
and
maltster
was
as
proud
and
obstinate
as
if
he
had
been
a
very
lofty
personage
in
whom
such
dispositions
might
be
a
source
of
that
conspicuous
tragedy
which
sweeps
the
stage
in
regal
robes
and
makes
the
dullest
chronicler
sublime
the
pride
and
obstinacy
of
millers
and
other
insignificant
people
whom
you
pass
unnoticingly
on
the
road
every
day
have
their
tragedy
too
but
it
is
of
that
unwept
hidden
sort
that
goes
on
from
generation
to
generation
and
leaves
no
record
such
tragedy
perhaps
as
lies
in
the
conflicts
of
young
souls
hungry
for
joy
under
a
lot
made
suddenly
hard
to
them
under
the
dreariness
of
a
home
where
the
morning
brings
no
promise
with
it
and
where
the
unexpectant
discontent
of
worn
and
disappointed
parents
weighs
on
the
children
like
a
damp
thick
air
in
which
all
the
functions
of
life
are
depressed
or
such
tragedy
as
lies
in
the
slow
or
sudden
death
that
follows
on
a
bruised
passion
though
it
may
be
a
death
that
finds
only
a
parish
funeral
there
are
certain
animals
to
which
tenacity
of
position
is
a
law
of
life
they
can
never
flourish
again
after
a
single
wrench
and
there
are
certain
human
beings
to
whom
predominance
is
a
law
of
life
they
can
only
sustain
humiliation
so
long
as
they
can
refuse
to
believe
in
it
and
in
their
own
conception
predominate
still
tulliver
was
still
predominating
in
his
own
imagination
as
he
approached
ogg
through
which
he
had
to
pass
on
his
way
homeward
but
what
was
it
that
suggested
to
him
as
he
saw
the
laceham
coach
entering
the
town
to
follow
it
to
the
and
get
the
clerk
there
to
write
a
letter
requiring
maggie
to
come
home
the
very
next
day
tulliver
own
hand
shook
too
much
under
his
excitement
for
him
to
write
himself
and
he
wanted
the
letter
to
be
given
to
the
coachman
to
deliver
at
miss
firniss
school
in
the
morning
there
was
a
craving
which
he
would
not
account
for
to
himself
to
have
maggie
near
him
without
delay
she
must
come
back
by
the
coach
to
tulliver
when
he
got
home
he
would
admit
no
difficulties
and
scolded
down
her
burst
of
grief
on
hearing
that
the
lawsuit
was
lost
by
angry
assertions
that
there
was
nothing
to
grieve
about
he
said
nothing
to
her
that
night
about
the
bill
of
sale
and
the
application
to
pullet
for
he
had
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
that
transaction
and
had
explained
the
necessity
for
taking
an
inventory
of
the
goods
as
a
matter
connected
with
his
will
the
possession
of
a
wife
conspicuously
one
inferior
in
intellect
is
like
other
high
privileges
attended
with
a
few
inconveniences
and
among
the
rest
with
the
occasional
necessity
for
using
a
little
deception
the
next
day
tulliver
was
again
on
horseback
in
the
afternoon
on
his
way
to
gore
office
at
ogg
gore
was
to
have
seen
furley
in
the
morning
and
to
have
sounded
him
in
relation
to
tulliver
affairs
but
he
had
not
gone
when
he
met
a
clerk
from
gore
office
who
was
bringing
a
letter
to
tulliver
gore
had
been
prevented
by
a
sudden
call
of
business
from
waiting
at
his
office
to
see
tulliver
according
to
appointment
but
would
be
at
his
office
at
eleven
morning
and
meanwhile
had
sent
some
important
information
by
letter
oh
said
tulliver
taking
the
letter
but
not
opening
it
then
tell
gore
i
see
him
at
eleven
and
he
turned
his
horse
the
clerk
struck
with
tulliver
glistening
excited
glance
looked
after
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
rode
away
the
reading
of
a
letter
was
not
the
affair
of
an
instant
to
tulliver
he
took
in
the
sense
of
a
statement
very
slowly
through
the
medium
of
written
or
even
printed
characters
so
he
had
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
thinking
he
would
open
it
in
his
armchair
at
home
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
letter
tulliver
must
not
know
about
and
if
so
it
would
be
better
to
keep
it
out
of
her
sight
altogether
he
stopped
his
horse
took
out
the
letter
and
read
it
it
was
only
a
short
letter
the
substance
was
that
gore
had
ascertained
on
secret
but
sure
authority
that
furley
had
been
lately
much
straitened
for
money
and
had
parted
with
his
securities
among
the
rest
the
mortgage
on
property
which
he
had
transferred
to
wakem
in
half
an
hour
after
this
tulliver
own
wagoner
found
him
lying
by
the
roadside
insensible
with
an
open
letter
near
him
and
his
gray
horse
snuffing
uneasily
about
him
when
maggie
reached
home
that
evening
in
obedience
to
her
call
he
was
no
longer
insensible
about
an
hour
before
he
had
become
conscious
and
after
vague
vacant
looks
around
him
had
muttered
something
about
a
letter
which
he
presently
repeated
impatiently
at
the
instance
of
turnbull
the
medical
man
gore
letter
was
brought
and
laid
on
the
bed
and
the
previous
impatience
seemed
to
be
allayed
the
stricken
man
lay
for
some
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
letter
as
if
he
were
trying
to
knit
up
his
thoughts
by
its
help
but
presently
a
new
wave
of
memory
seemed
to
have
come
and
swept
the
other
away
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
letter
to
the
door
and
after
looking
uneasily
as
if
striving
to
see
something
his
eyes
were
too
dim
for
he
said
the
little
wench
he
repeated
the
words
impatiently
from
time
to
time
appearing
entirely
unconscious
of
everything
except
this
one
importunate
want
and
giving
no
sign
of
knowing
his
wife
or
any
one
else
and
poor
tulliver
her
feeble
faculties
almost
paralyzed
by
this
sudden
accumulation
of
troubles
went
backward
and
forward
to
the
gate
to
see
if
the
laceham
coach
were
coming
though
it
was
not
yet
time
but
it
came
at
last
and
set
down
the
poor
anxious
girl
no
longer
the
little
wench
except
to
her
father
fond
memory
oh
mother
what
is
the
matter
maggie
said
with
pale
lips
as
her
mother
came
toward
her
crying
she
did
think
her
father
was
ill
because
the
letter
had
come
at
his
dictation
from
the
office
at
ogg
but
turnbull
came
now
to
meet
her
a
medical
man
is
the
good
angel
of
the
troubled
house
and
maggie
ran
toward
the
kind
old
friend
whom
she
remembered
as
long
as
she
could
remember
anything
with
a
trembling
questioning
look
do
alarm
yourself
too
much
my
dear
he
said
taking
her
hand
your
father
has
had
a
sudden
attack
and
has
not
quite
recovered
his
memory
but
he
has
been
asking
for
you
and
it
will
do
him
good
to
see
you
keep
as
quiet
as
you
can
take
off
your
things
and
come
upstairs
with
me
maggie
obeyed
with
that
terrible
beating
of
the
heart
which
makes
existence
seem
simply
a
painful
pulsation
the
very
quietness
with
which
turnbull
spoke
had
frightened
her
susceptible
imagination
her
father
eyes
were
still
turned
uneasily
toward
the
door
when
she
entered
and
met
the
strange
yearning
helpless
look
that
had
been
seeking
her
in
vain
with
a
sudden
flash
and
movement
he
raised
himself
in
the
bed
she
rushed
toward
him
and
clasped
him
with
agonized
kisses
poor
child
it
was
very
early
for
her
to
know
one
of
those
supreme
moments
in
life
when
all
we
have
hoped
or
delighted
in
all
we
can
dread
or
endure
falls
away
from
our
regard
as
insignificant
is
lost
like
a
trivial
memory
in
that
simple
primitive
love
which
knits
us
to
the
beings
who
have
been
nearest
to
us
in
their
times
of
helplessness
or
of
anguish
but
that
flash
of
recognition
had
been
too
great
a
strain
on
the
father
bruised
enfeebled
powers
he
sank
back
again
in
renewed
insensibility
and
rigidity
which
lasted
for
many
hours
and
was
only
broken
by
a
flickering
return
of
consciousness
in
which
he
took
passively
everything
that
was
given
to
him
and
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
infantine
satisfaction
in
maggie
near
presence
such
satisfaction
as
a
baby
has
when
it
is
returned
to
the
nurse
lap
tulliver
sent
for
her
sisters
and
there
was
much
wailing
and
lifting
up
of
hands
below
stairs
both
uncles
and
aunts
saw
that
the
ruin
of
bessy
and
her
family
was
as
complete
as
they
had
ever
foreboded
it
and
there
was
a
general
family
sense
that
a
judgment
had
fallen
on
tulliver
which
it
would
be
an
impiety
to
counteract
by
too
much
kindness
but
maggie
heard
little
of
this
scarcely
ever
leaving
her
father
bedside
where
she
sat
opposite
him
with
her
hand
on
his
tulliver
wanted
to
have
tom
fetched
home
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
more
of
her
boy
even
than
of
her
husband
but
the
aunts
and
uncles
opposed
this
tom
was
better
at
school
since
turnbull
said
there
was
no
immediate
danger
he
believed
but
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
when
maggie
had
become
more
accustomed
to
her
fits
of
insensibility
and
to
the
expectation
that
he
would
revive
from
them
the
thought
of
tom
had
become
urgent
with
too
and
when
her
mother
sate
crying
at
night
and
saying
my
poor
lad
nothing
but
right
he
should
come
home
maggie
said
let
me
go
for
him
and
tell
him
mother
i
go
morning
if
father
know
me
and
want
me
it
would
be
so
hard
for
tom
to
come
home
and
not
know
anything
about
it
beforehand
and
the
next
morning
maggie
went
as
we
have
seen
sitting
on
the
coach
on
their
way
home
the
brother
and
sister
talked
to
each
other
in
sad
interrupted
whispers
they
say
wakem
has
got
a
mortgage
or
something
on
the
land
tom
said
maggie
it
was
the
letter
with
that
news
in
it
that
made
father
ill
they
think
i
believe
that
scoundrel
been
planning
all
along
to
ruin
my
father
said
tom
leaping
from
the
vaguest
impressions
to
a
definite
conclusion
i
make
him
feel
for
it
when
i
a
man
mind
you
never
speak
to
philip
again
oh
tom
said
maggie
in
a
tone
of
sad
remonstrance
but
she
had
no
spirit
to
dispute
anything
then
still
less
to
vex
tom
by
opposing
him
chapter
ii
tulliver
teraphim
or
household
gods
when
the
coach
set
down
tom
and
maggie
it
was
five
hours
since
she
had
started
from
home
and
she
was
thinking
with
some
trembling
that
her
father
had
perhaps
missed
her
and
asked
for
the
little
wench
in
vain
she
thought
of
no
other
change
that
might
have
happened
she
hurried
along
the
and
entered
the
house
before
tom
but
in
the
entrance
she
was
startled
by
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
the
parlor
door
was
ajar
that
was
where
the
smell
came
from
it
was
very
strange
could
any
visitor
be
smoking
at
a
time
like
this
was
her
mother
there
if
so
she
must
be
told
that
tom
was
come
maggie
after
this
pause
of
surprise
was
only
in
the
act
of
opening
the
door
when
tom
came
up
and
they
both
looked
into
the
parlor
together
there
was
a
coarse
dingy
man
of
whose
face
tom
had
some
vague
recollection
sitting
in
his
father
chair
smoking
with
a
jug
and
glass
beside
him
the
truth
flashed
on
tom
mind
in
an
instant
to
have
the
bailiff
in
the
house
and
to
be
sold
up
were
phrases
which
he
had
been
used
to
even
as
a
little
boy
they
were
part
of
the
disgrace
and
misery
of
failing
of
losing
all
one
money
and
being
ruined
sinking
into
the
condition
of
poor
working
people
it
seemed
only
natural
this
should
happen
since
his
father
had
lost
all
his
property
and
he
thought
of
no
more
special
cause
for
this
particular
form
of
misfortune
than
the
loss
of
the
lawsuit
but
the
immediate
presence
of
this
disgrace
was
so
much
keener
an
experience
to
tom
than
the
worst
form
of
apprehension
that
he
felt
at
this
moment
as
if
his
real
trouble
had
only
just
begin
it
was
a
touch
on
the
irritated
nerve
compared
with
its
spontaneous
dull
aching
how
do
you
do
sir
said
the
man
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
with
rough
embarrassed
civility
the
two
young
startled
faces
made
him
a
little
uncomfortable
but
tom
turned
away
hastily
without
speaking
the
sight
was
too
hateful
maggie
had
not
understood
the
appearance
of
this
stranger
as
tom
had
she
followed
him
whispering
who
can
it
be
tom
what
is
the
matter
then
with
a
sudden
undefined
dread
lest
this
stranger
might
have
something
to
do
with
a
change
in
her
father
she
rushed
upstairs
checking
herself
at
the
bedroom
door
to
throw
off
her
bonnet
and
enter
on
tiptoe
all
was
silent
there
her
father
was
lying
heedless
of
everything
around
him
with
his
eyes
closed
as
when
she
had
left
him
a
servant
was
there
but
not
her
mother
where
my
mother
she
whispered
the
servant
did
not
know
maggie
hastened
out
and
said
to
tom
father
is
lying
quiet
let
us
go
and
look
for
my
mother
i
wonder
where
she
is
tulliver
was
not
downstairs
not
in
any
of
the
bedrooms
there
was
but
one
room
below
the
attic
which
maggie
had
left
unsearched
it
was
the
storeroom
where
her
mother
kept
all
her
linen
and
all
the
precious
best
things
that
were
only
unwrapped
and
brought
out
on
special
occasions
tom
preceding
maggie
as
they
returned
along
the
passage
opened
the
door
of
this
room
and
immediately
said
mother
tulliver
was
seated
there
with
all
her
treasures
one
of
the
linen
chests
was
open
the
silver
teapot
was
unwrapped
from
its
many
folds
of
paper
and
the
best
china
was
laid
out
on
the
top
of
the
closed
spoons
and
skewers
and
ladles
were
spread
in
rows
on
the
shelves
and
the
poor
woman
was
shaking
her
head
and
weeping
with
a
bitter
tension
of
the
mouth
over
the
mark
elizabeth
dodson
on
the
corner
of
some
tablecloths
she
held
in
her
lap
she
dropped
them
and
started
up
as
tom
spoke
oh
my
boy
my
boy
she
said
clasping
him
round
the
neck
to
think
as
i
should
live
to
see
this
day
we
ruined
everything
going
to
be
sold
up
to
think
as
your
father
should
ha
married
me
to
bring
me
to
this
we
got
nothing
we
shall
be
beggars
we
must
go
to
the
workhouse
she
kissed
him
then
seated
herself
again
and
took
another
tablecloth
on
her
lap
unfolding
it
a
little
way
to
look
at
the
pattern
while
the
children
stood
by
in
mute
wretchedness
their
minds
quite
filled
for
the
moment
with
the
words
beggars
and
workhouse
to
think
o
these
cloths
as
i
spun
myself
she
went
on
lifting
things
out
and
turning
them
over
with
an
excitement
all
the
more
strange
and
piteous
because
the
stout
blond
woman
was
usually
so
passive
if
she
had
been
ruffled
before
it
was
at
the
surface
merely
and
job
haxey
wove
and
brought
the
piece
home
on
his
back
as
i
remember
standing
at
the
door
and
seeing
him
come
before
i
ever
thought
o
marrying
your
father
and
the
pattern
as
i
chose
myself
and
bleached
so
beautiful
and
i
marked
so
as
nobody
ever
saw
such
marking
they
must
cut
the
cloth
to
get
it
out
for
it
a
particular
stitch
and
they
all
to
be
sold
and
go
into
strange
people
houses
and
perhaps
be
cut
with
the
knives
and
wore
out
before
i
dead
you
never
have
one
of
my
boy
she
said
looking
up
at
tom
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
i
meant
for
you
i
wanted
you
to
have
all
o
this
pattern
maggie
could
have
had
the
large
check
it
never
shows
so
well
when
the
dishes
are
on
it
tom
was
touched
to
the
quick
but
there
was
an
angry
reaction
immediately
his
face
flushed
as
he
said
but
will
my
aunts
let
them
be
sold
mother
do
they
know
about
it
they
never
let
your
linen
go
will
they
have
you
sent
to
them
yes
i
sent
luke
directly
they
put
the
bailies
in
and
your
aunt
pullet
been
and
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
cries
so
and
says
your
father
disgraced
my
family
and
made
it
the
talk
o
the
country
and
she
buy
the
spotted
cloths
for
herself
because
she
never
had
so
many
as
she
wanted
o
that
pattern
and
they
go
to
strangers
but
she
got
more
checks
nor
she
can
do
with
here
tulliver
began
to
lay
back
the
tablecloths
in
the
chest
folding
and
stroking
them
automatically
and
your
uncle
glegg
been
too
and
he
says
things
must
be
bought
in
for
us
to
lie
down
on
but
he
must
talk
to
your
aunt
and
they
all
coming
to
consult
but
i
know
none
of
take
my
chany
she
added
turning
toward
the
cups
and
saucers
for
they
all
found
fault
with
when
i
bought
o
the
small
gold
sprig
all
over
between
the
flowers
but
none
of
got
better
chany
not
even
your
aunt
pullet
herself
and
i
bought
it
wi
my
own
money
as
i
saved
ever
since
i
was
turned
fifteen
and
the
silver
teapot
too
your
father
never
paid
for
and
to
think
as
he
should
ha
married
me
and
brought
me
to
this
tulliver
burst
out
crying
afresh
and
she
sobbed
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
a
few
moments
but
then
removing
it
she
said
in
a
deprecating
way
still
half
sobbing
as
if
she
were
called
upon
to
speak
before
she
could
command
her
voice
and
i
say
to
him
times
and
times
you
do
do
go
to
law
and
what
more
could
i
do
i
had
to
sit
by
while
my
own
fortin
been
spent
and
what
should
ha
been
my
children
too
you
have
niver
a
penny
my
boy
but
it
is
your
poor
fault
she
put
out
one
arm
toward
tom
looking
up
at
him
piteously
with
her
helpless
childish
blue
eyes
the
poor
lad
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
she
clung
to
him
for
the
first
time
tom
thought
of
his
father
with
some
reproach
his
natural
inclination
to
blame
hitherto
kept
entirely
in
abeyance
toward
his
father
by
the
predisposition
to
think
him
always
right
simply
on
the
ground
that
he
was
tom
father
was
turned
into
this
new
channel
by
his
mother
plaints
and
with
his
indignation
against
wakem
there
began
to
mingle
some
indignation
of
another
sort
perhaps
his
father
might
have
helped
bringing
them
all
down
in
the
world
and
making
people
talk
of
them
with
contempt
but
no
one
should
talk
long
of
tom
tulliver
with
contempt
the
natural
strength
and
firmness
of
his
nature
was
beginning
to
assert
itself
urged
by
the
double
stimulus
of
resentment
against
his
aunts
and
the
sense
that
he
must
behave
like
a
man
and
take
care
of
his
mother
do
fret
mother
he
said
tenderly
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
get
money
i
get
a
situation
of
some
sort
bless
you
my
boy
said
tulliver
a
little
soothed
then
looking
round
sadly
but
i
should
ha
minded
so
much
if
we
could
ha
kept
the
things
wi
my
name
on
maggie
had
witnessed
this
scene
with
gathering
anger
the
implied
reproaches
against
her
father
her
father
who
was
lying
there
in
a
sort
of
living
death
neutralized
all
her
pity
for
griefs
about
tablecloths
and
china
and
her
anger
on
her
father
account
was
heightened
by
some
egoistic
resentment
at
tom
silent
concurrence
with
her
mother
in
shutting
her
out
from
the
common
calamity
she
had
become
almost
indifferent
to
her
mother
habitual
depreciation
of
her
but
she
was
keenly
alive
to
any
sanction
of
it
however
passive
that
she
might
suspect
in
tom
poor
maggie
was
by
no
means
made
up
of
unalloyed
devotedness
but
put
forth
large
claims
for
herself
where
she
loved
strongly
she
burst
out
at
last
in
an
agitated
almost
violent
tone
mother
how
can
you
talk
so
as
if
you
cared
only
for
things
with
name
on
and
not
for
what
has
my
father
name
too
and
to
care
about
anything
but
dear
father
himself
when
he
lying
there
and
may
never
speak
to
us
again
tom
you
ought
to
say
so
too
you
ought
not
to
let
any
one
find
fault
with
my
father
maggie
almost
choked
with
mingled
grief
and
anger
left
the
room
and
took
her
old
place
on
her
father
bed
her
heart
went
out
to
him
with
a
stronger
movement
than
ever
at
the
thought
that
people
would
blame
him
maggie
hated
blame
she
had
been
blamed
all
her
life
and
nothing
had
come
of
it
but
evil
tempers
her
father
had
always
defended
and
excused
her
and
her
loving
remembrance
of
his
tenderness
was
a
force
within
her
that
would
enable
her
to
do
or
bear
anything
for
his
sake
tom
was
a
little
shocked
at
maggie
outburst
telling
as
well
as
his
mother
what
it
was
right
to
do
she
ought
to
have
learned
better
than
have
those
hectoring
assuming
manners
by
this
time
but
he
presently
went
into
his
father
room
and
the
sight
there
touched
him
in
a
way
that
effaced
the
slighter
impressions
of
the
previous
hour
when
maggie
saw
how
he
was
moved
she
went
to
him
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
as
he
sat
by
the
bed
and
the
two
children
forgot
everything
else
in
the
sense
that
they
had
one
father
and
one
sorrow
chapter
iii
the
family
council
it
was
at
eleven
the
next
morning
that
the
aunts
and
uncles
came
to
hold
their
consultation
the
fire
was
lighted
in
the
large
parlor
and
poor
tulliver
with
a
confused
impression
that
it
was
a
great
occasion
like
a
funeral
unbagged
the
tassels
and
unpinned
the
curtains
adjusting
them
in
proper
folds
looking
round
and
shaking
her
head
sadly
at
the
polished
tops
and
legs
of
the
tables
which
sister
pullet
herself
could
not
accuse
of
insufficient
brightness
deane
was
not
coming
he
was
away
on
business
but
deane
appeared
punctually
in
that
handsome
new
gig
with
the
head
to
it
and
the
driving
it
which
had
thrown
so
clear
a
light
on
several
traits
in
her
character
to
some
of
her
female
friends
in
ogg
deane
had
been
advancing
in
the
world
as
rapidly
as
tulliver
had
been
going
down
in
it
and
in
deane
house
the
dodson
linen
and
plate
were
beginning
to
hold
quite
a
subordinate
position
as
a
mere
supplement
to
the
handsomer
articles
of
the
same
kind
purchased
in
recent
years
a
change
which
had
caused
an
occasional
coolness
in
the
sisterly
intercourse
between
her
and
glegg
who
felt
that
susan
was
getting
like
the
rest
and
there
would
soon
be
little
of
the
true
dodson
spirit
surviving
except
in
herself
and
it
might
be
hoped
in
those
nephews
who
supported
the
dodson
name
on
the
family
land
far
away
in
the
wolds
people
who
live
at
a
distance
are
naturally
less
faulty
than
those
immediately
under
our
own
eyes
and
it
seems
superfluous
when
we
consider
the
remote
geographical
position
of
the
ethiopians
and
how
very
little
the
greeks
had
to
do
with
them
to
inquire
further
why
homer
calls
them
blameless
deane
was
the
first
to
arrive
and
when
she
had
taken
her
seat
in
the
large
parlor
tulliver
came
down
to
her
with
her
comely
face
a
little
distorted
nearly
as
it
would
have
been
if
she
had
been
crying
she
was
not
a
woman
who
could
shed
abundant
tears
except
in
moments
when
the
prospect
of
losing
her
furniture
became
unusually
vivid
but
she
felt
how
unfitting
it
was
to
be
quite
calm
under
present
circumstances
oh
sister
what
a
world
this
is
she
exclaimed
as
she
entered
what
trouble
oh
dear
deane
was
a
woman
who
made
small
speeches
on
peculiar
occasions
repeating
them
afterward
to
her
husband
and
asking
him
if
she
had
not
spoken
very
properly
yes
sister
she
said
deliberately
this
is
a
changing
world
and
we
do
know
what
may
happen
tomorrow
but
it
right
to
be
prepared
for
all
things
and
if
trouble
sent
to
remember
as
it
is
sent
without
a
cause
i
very
sorry
for
you
as
a
sister
and
if
the
doctor
orders
jelly
for
tulliver
i
hope
you
let
me
know
i
send
it
willingly
for
it
is
but
right
he
should
have
proper
attendance
while
he
thank
you
susan
said
tulliver
rather
faintly
withdrawing
her
fat
hand
from
her
sister
thin
one
but
there
been
no
talk
jelly
yet
then
after
a
moment
pause
she
added
there
a
dozen
cut
upstairs
i
shall
never
put
jelly
into
no
more
her
voice
was
rather
agitated
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
but
the
sound
of
wheels
diverted
her
thoughts
and
glegg
were
come
and
were
almost
immediately
followed
by
and
pullet
pullet
entered
crying
as
a
compendious
mode
at
all
times
of
expressing
what
were
her
views
of
life
in
general
and
what
in
brief
were
the
opinions
she
held
concerning
the
particular
case
before
her
glegg
had
on
her
fuzziest
front
and
garments
which
appeared
to
have
had
a
recent
resurrection
from
rather
a
creasy
form
of
burial
a
costume
selected
with
the
high
moral
purpose
of
instilling
perfect
humility
into
bessy
and
her
children
wo
you
come
nearer
the
fire
said
her
husband
unwilling
to
take
the
more
comfortable
seat
without
offering
it
to
her
you
see
i
seated
myself
here
glegg
returned
this
superior
woman
can
roast
yourself
if
you
like
well
said
glegg
seating
himself
and
how
the
poor
man
upstairs
turnbull
thought
him
a
deal
better
this
morning
said
tulliver
he
took
more
notice
and
spoke
to
me
but
he
never
known
tom
yet
looks
at
the
poor
lad
as
if
he
was
a
stranger
though
he
said
something
once
about
tom
and
the
pony
the
doctor
says
his
memory
gone
a
long
way
back
and
he
does
know
tom
because
thinking
of
him
when
he
was
little
eh
dear
eh
dear
i
doubt
it
the
water
got
on
his
brain
said
aunt
pullet
turning
round
from
adjusting
her
cap
in
a
melancholy
way
at
the
it
much
if
he
ever
gets
up
again
and
if
he
does
he
most
like
be
childish
as
carr
was
poor
man
they
fed
him
with
a
spoon
as
if
he
been
a
babby
for
three
year
he
quite
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
but
then
he
got
a
bath
chair
and
somebody
to
draw
him
and
that
what
you
wo
have
i
doubt
bessy
sister
pullet
said
glegg
severely
if
i
understand
right
we
come
together
this
morning
to
advise
and
consult
about
what
to
be
done
in
this
disgrace
as
has
fallen
upon
the
family
and
not
to
talk
o
people
as
do
belong
to
us
carr
was
none
of
our
blood
nor
noways
connected
with
us
as
i
ever
heared
sister
glegg
said
pullet
in
a
pleading
tone
drawing
on
her
gloves
again
and
stroking
the
fingers
in
an
agitated
manner
if
you
got
anything
disrespectful
to
say
o
carr
i
do
beg
of
you
as
you
wo
say
it
to
me
know
what
he
was
she
added
with
a
sigh
his
breath
was
short
to
that
degree
as
you
could
hear
him
two
rooms
off
sophy
said
glegg
with
indignant
disgust
you
talk
people
complaints
till
it
quite
undecent
but
i
say
again
as
i
said
before
i
did
come
away
from
home
to
talk
about
acquaintances
whether
they
short
breath
or
long
if
we
are
come
together
for
one
to
hear
what
the
other
do
to
save
a
sister
and
her
children
from
the
parish
shall
go
back
ca
act
without
the
other
i
suppose
it
is
to
be
expected
as
should
do
everything
well
jane
said
pullet
i
do
see
as
you
been
so
very
forrard
at
doing
so
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
first
time
as
here
you
been
since
it
been
known
as
the
bailiff
in
the
house
and
i
was
here
yesterday
and
looked
at
all
bessy
linen
and
things
and
i
told
her
i
buy
in
the
spotted
tablecloths
i
could
speak
fairer
for
as
for
the
teapot
as
she
does
want
to
go
out
o
the
family
it
stands
to
sense
i
ca
do
with
two
silver
teapots
not
if
it
a
straight
spout
but
the
spotted
damask
i
was
allays
fond
on
i
wish
it
could
be
managed
so
as
my
teapot
and
chany
and
the
best
castors
need
be
put
up
for
sale
said
poor
tulliver
beseechingly
and
the
the
first
things
ever
i
bought
but
that
ca
be
helped
you
know
said
glegg
if
one
o
the
family
chooses
to
buy
in
they
can
but
one
thing
must
be
bid
for
as
well
as
another
and
it
is
to
be
looked
for
said
uncle
pullet
with
unwonted
independence
of
idea
as
your
own
family
should
pay
more
for
things
nor
they
fetch
they
may
go
for
an
old
song
by
auction
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
tulliver
to
think
o
my
chany
being
sold
i
that
way
and
i
bought
it
when
i
was
married
just
as
you
did
yours
jane
and
sophy
and
i
know
you
did
like
mine
because
o
the
sprig
but
i
was
fond
of
it
and
there
never
been
a
bit
broke
for
i
washed
it
myself
and
there
the
tulips
on
the
cups
and
the
roses
as
anybody
might
go
and
look
at
for
pleasure
you
like
chany
to
go
for
an
old
song
and
be
broke
to
pieces
though
yours
has
got
no
color
in
it
jane
it
all
white
and
fluted
and
did
cost
so
much
as
mine
and
there
the
castors
sister
deane
i
ca
think
but
you
like
to
have
the
castors
for
i
heard
you
say
they
pretty
well
i
no
objection
to
buy
some
of
the
best
things
said
deane
rather
loftily
we
can
do
with
extra
things
in
our
house
best
things
exclaimed
glegg
with
severity
which
had
gathered
intensity
from
her
long
silence
it
drives
me
past
patience
to
hear
you
all
talking
o
best
things
and
buying
in
this
that
and
the
other
such
as
silver
and
chany
you
must
bring
your
mind
to
your
circumstances
bessy
and
not
be
thinking
o
silver
and
chany
but
whether
you
shall
get
so
much
as
a
to
lie
on
and
a
blanket
to
cover
you
and
a
stool
to
sit
on
you
must
remember
if
you
get
it
be
because
your
friends
have
bought
for
you
for
dependent
upon
for
everything
for
your
husband
lies
there
helpless
and
has
got
a
penny
i
the
world
to
call
his
own
and
it
for
your
own
good
i
say
this
for
it
right
you
should
feel
what
your
state
is
and
what
disgrace
your
husband
brought
on
your
own
family
as
you
got
to
look
to
for
everything
and
be
humble
in
your
mind
glegg
paused
for
speaking
with
much
energy
for
the
good
of
others
is
naturally
exhausting
tulliver
always
borne
down
by
the
family
predominance
of
sister
jane
who
had
made
her
wear
the
yoke
of
a
younger
sister
in
very
tender
years
said
pleadingly
i
sure
sister
i
never
asked
anybody
to
do
anything
only
buy
things
as
it
be
a
pleasure
to
to
have
so
as
they
might
go
and
be
spoiled
i
strange
houses
i
never
asked
anybody
to
buy
the
things
in
for
me
and
my
children
though
there
the
linen
i
spun
and
i
thought
when
tom
was
born
i
thought
one
o
the
first
things
when
he
was
lying
i
the
cradle
as
all
the
things
i
bought
wi
my
own
money
and
been
so
careful
of
go
to
him
but
i
said
nothing
as
i
wanted
my
sisters
to
pay
their
money
for
me
what
my
husband
has
done
for
sister
unknown
and
we
should
ha
been
better
off
this
day
if
it
had
been
as
he
lent
money
and
never
asked
for
it
again
come
come
said
glegg
kindly
do
let
us
make
things
too
dark
what
done
ca
be
undone
we
shall
make
a
shift
among
us
to
buy
what
sufficient
for
you
though
as
says
they
must
be
useful
plain
things
we
must
be
thinking
o
what
unnecessary
a
table
and
a
chair
or
two
and
kitchen
things
and
a
good
bed
and
why
i
seen
the
day
when
i
should
ha
known
myself
if
i
lain
on
sacking
o
the
floor
we
get
a
deal
o
useless
things
about
us
only
because
we
got
the
money
to
spend
glegg
said
if
you
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
speak
o
taking
the
words
out
o
my
mouth
i
was
going
to
say
bessy
as
it
fine
talking
for
you
to
say
as
you
never
asked
us
to
buy
anything
for
you
let
me
tell
you
you
to
have
asked
us
pray
how
are
you
to
be
purvided
for
if
your
own
family
do
help
you
you
must
go
to
the
parish
if
they
did
and
you
ought
to
know
that
and
keep
it
in
mind
and
ask
us
humble
to
do
what
we
can
for
you
o
saying
and
making
a
boast
as
you
never
asked
us
for
anything
you
talked
o
the
mosses
and
what
tulliver
done
for
said
uncle
pullet
who
became
unusually
suggestive
where
advances
of
money
were
concerned
have
been
anear
you
they
ought
to
do
something
as
well
as
other
folks
and
if
he
lent
money
they
ought
to
be
made
to
pay
it
back
yes
to
be
sure
said
deane
i
been
thinking
so
how
is
it
and
moss
are
here
to
meet
us
it
is
but
right
they
should
do
their
share
oh
dear
said
tulliver
i
never
sent
word
about
tulliver
and
they
live
so
among
the
lanes
at
basset
they
niver
hear
anything
only
when
moss
comes
to
market
but
i
niver
gave
a
thought
i
wonder
maggie
did
though
for
she
was
allays
so
fond
of
her
aunt
moss
why
do
your
children
come
in
bessy
said
pullet
at
the
mention
of
maggie
they
should
hear
what
their
aunts
and
uncles
have
got
to
say
and
maggie
when
it
me
as
have
paid
for
half
her
schooling
she
ought
to
think
more
of
her
aunt
pullet
than
of
aunt
moss
i
may
go
off
sudden
when
i
get
home
there
no
telling
if
i
had
way
said
glegg
the
children
ha
been
in
the
room
from
the
first
it
time
they
knew
who
they
to
look
to
and
it
right
as
should
talk
to
and
let
know
their
condition
i
life
and
what
they
come
down
to
and
make
feel
as
they
got
to
suffer
for
their
father
faults
well
i
go
and
fetch
sister
said
tulliver
resignedly
she
was
quite
crushed
now
and
thought
of
the
treasures
in
the
storeroom
with
no
other
feeling
than
blank
despair
she
went
upstairs
to
fetch
tom
and
maggie
who
were
both
in
their
father
room
and
was
on
her
way
down
again
when
the
sight
of
the
storeroom
door
suggested
a
new
thought
to
her
she
went
toward
it
and
left
the
children
to
go
down
by
themselves
the
aunts
and
uncles
appeared
to
have
been
in
warm
discussion
when
the
brother
and
sister
entered
both
with
shrinking
reluctance
for
though
tom
with
a
practical
sagacity
which
had
been
roused
into
activity
by
the
strong
stimulus
of
the
new
emotions
he
had
undergone
since
yesterday
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
a
plan
which
he
meant
to
propose
to
one
of
his
aunts
or
uncles
he
felt
by
no
means
amicably
toward
them
and
dreaded
meeting
them
all
at
once
as
he
would
have
dreaded
a
large
dose
of
concentrated
physic
which
was
but
just
endurable
in
small
draughts
as
for
maggie
she
was
peculiarly
depressed
this
morning
she
had
been
called
up
after
brief
rest
at
three
and
had
that
strange
dreamy
weariness
which
comes
from
watching
in
a
through
the
chill
hours
of
early
twilight
and
breaking
day
in
which
the
outside
life
seems
to
have
no
importance
and
to
be
a
mere
margin
to
the
hours
in
the
darkened
chamber
their
entrance
interrupted
the
conversation
the
shaking
of
hands
was
a
melancholy
and
silent
ceremony
till
uncle
pullet
observed
as
tom
approached
him
well
young
sir
we
been
talking
as
we
should
want
your
pen
and
ink
you
can
write
rarely
now
after
all
your
schooling
i
should
think
ay
ay
said
uncle
glegg
with
admonition
which
he
meant
to
be
kind
we
must
look
to
see
the
good
of
all
this
schooling
as
your
sunk
so
much
money
in
now
land
is
gone
and
money
spent
then
learning
is
most
excellent
now
the
time
tom
to
let
us
see
the
good
o
your
learning
let
us
see
whether
you
can
do
better
than
i
can
as
have
made
my
fortin
without
it
but
i
began
wi
doing
with
little
you
see
i
could
live
on
a
basin
o
porridge
and
a
crust
o
but
i
doubt
high
living
and
high
learning
make
it
harder
for
you
young
man
nor
it
was
for
me
but
he
must
do
it
interposed
aunt
glegg
energetically
whether
it
hard
or
no
he
has
got
to
consider
what
hard
he
must
consider
as
he
is
to
trusten
to
his
friends
to
keep
him
in
idleness
and
luxury
he
got
to
bear
the
fruits
of
his
father
misconduct
and
bring
his
mind
to
fare
hard
and
to
work
hard
and
he
must
be
humble
and
grateful
to
his
aunts
and
uncles
for
what
they
doing
for
his
mother
and
father
as
must
be
turned
out
into
the
streets
and
go
to
the
workhouse
if
they
did
help
and
his
sister
too
continued
glegg
looking
severely
at
maggie
who
had
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
her
aunt
deane
drawn
to
her
by
the
sense
that
she
was
lucy
mother
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
be
humble
and
work
for
there
be
no
servants
to
wait
on
her
any
more
she
must
remember
that
she
must
do
the
work
o
the
house
and
she
must
respect
and
love
her
aunts
as
have
done
so
much
for
her
and
saved
their
money
to
leave
to
their
nepheys
and
nieces
tom
was
still
standing
before
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
group
there
was
a
heightened
color
in
his
face
and
he
was
very
far
from
looking
humbled
but
he
was
preparing
to
say
in
a
respectful
tone
something
he
had
previously
meditated
when
the
door
opened
and
his
mother
poor
tulliver
had
in
her
hands
a
small
tray
on
which
she
had
placed
her
silver
teapot
a
specimen
teacup
and
saucer
the
castors
and
see
here
sister
she
said
looking
at
deane
as
she
set
the
tray
on
the
table
i
thought
perhaps
if
you
looked
at
the
teapot
again
it
a
good
while
since
you
saw
it
you
might
like
the
pattern
better
it
makes
beautiful
tea
and
there
a
stand
and
everything
you
might
use
it
for
every
day
or
else
lay
it
by
for
lucy
when
she
goes
to
housekeeping
i
should
be
so
loath
for
to
buy
it
at
the
golden
lion
said
the
poor
woman
her
heart
swelling
and
the
tears
coming
my
teapot
as
i
bought
when
i
was
married
and
to
think
of
its
being
scratched
and
set
before
the
travellers
and
folks
and
my
letters
on
it
see
here
and
everybody
to
see
ah
dear
dear
said
aunt
pullet
shaking
her
head
with
deep
sadness
it
very
bad
to
think
o
the
family
initials
going
about
everywhere
it
niver
was
so
before
you
a
very
unlucky
sister
bessy
but
what
the
use
o
buying
the
teapot
when
there
the
linen
and
spoons
and
everything
to
go
and
some
of
with
your
full
name
and
when
it
got
that
straight
spout
too
as
to
disgrace
o
the
family
said
glegg
that
ca
be
helped
wi
buying
teapots
the
disgrace
is
for
one
o
the
family
to
married
a
man
as
has
brought
her
to
beggary
the
disgrace
is
as
they
to
be
sold
up
we
ca
hinder
the
country
from
knowing
that
maggie
had
started
up
from
the
sofa
at
the
allusion
to
her
father
but
tom
saw
her
action
and
flushed
face
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
speaking
be
quiet
maggie
he
said
authoritatively
pushing
her
aside
it
was
a
remarkable
manifestation
of
and
practical
judgment
in
a
lad
of
fifteen
that
when
his
aunt
glegg
ceased
he
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
and
respectful
manner
though
with
a
good
deal
of
trembling
in
his
voice
for
his
mother
words
had
cut
him
to
the
quick
then
aunt
he
said
looking
straight
at
glegg
if
you
think
it
a
disgrace
to
the
family
that
we
should
be
sold
up
would
it
be
better
to
prevent
it
altogether
and
if
you
and
aunt
pullet
he
continued
looking
at
the
latter
think
of
leaving
any
money
to
me
and
maggie
would
it
be
better
to
give
it
now
and
pay
the
debt
we
going
to
be
sold
up
for
and
save
my
mother
from
parting
with
her
furniture
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
for
every
one
including
maggie
was
astonished
at
tom
sudden
manliness
of
tone
uncle
glegg
was
the
first
to
speak
ay
ay
young
man
come
now
you
show
some
notion
o
things
but
there
the
interest
you
must
remember
your
aunts
get
five
per
cent
on
their
money
and
they
lose
that
if
they
advanced
it
you
thought
o
that
i
could
work
and
pay
that
every
year
said
tom
promptly
i
do
anything
to
save
my
mother
from
parting
with
her
things
well
done
said
uncle
glegg
admiringly
he
had
been
drawing
tom
out
rather
than
reflecting
on
the
practicability
of
his
proposal
but
he
had
produced
the
unfortunate
result
of
irritating
his
wife
yes
mr
glegg
said
that
lady
with
angry
sarcasm
it
pleasant
work
for
you
to
be
giving
my
money
away
as
you
pretended
to
leave
at
my
own
disposal
and
my
money
as
was
my
own
father
gift
and
not
yours
glegg
and
i
saved
it
and
added
to
it
myself
and
had
more
to
put
out
almost
every
year
and
it
to
go
and
be
sunk
in
other
folks
furniture
and
encourage
in
luxury
and
extravagance
as
they
no
means
of
supporting
and
i
to
alter
my
will
or
have
a
codicil
made
and
leave
two
or
three
hundred
less
behind
me
when
i
die
me
as
have
allays
done
right
and
been
careful
and
the
eldest
the
family
and
my
money
to
go
and
be
squandered
on
them
as
have
had
the
same
chance
as
me
only
they
been
wicked
and
wasteful
sister
pullet
may
do
as
you
like
and
you
may
let
your
husband
rob
you
back
again
o
the
money
he
given
you
but
that
is
sperrit
la
jane
how
fiery
you
are
said
pullet
i
sure
you
have
the
blood
in
your
head
and
have
to
be
cupped
i
sorry
for
bessy
and
her
children
i
sure
i
think
of
o
nights
dreadful
for
i
sleep
very
bad
wi
this
new
medicine
but
it
no
use
for
me
to
think
doing
anything
if
you
wo
meet
me
why
there
this
to
be
considered
said
glegg
it
no
use
to
pay
off
this
debt
and
save
the
furniture
when
there
all
the
law
debts
behind
as
take
every
shilling
and
more
than
could
be
made
out
o
land
and
stock
for
i
made
that
out
from
lawyer
gore
need
save
our
money
to
keep
the
poor
man
with
instead
o
spending
it
on
furniture
as
he
can
neither
eat
nor
drink
you
be
so
hasty
jane
as
if
i
did
know
what
was
reasonable
then
speak
accordingly
mr
glegg
said
his
wife
with
slow
loud
emphasis
bending
her
head
toward
him
significantly
tom
countenance
had
fallen
during
this
conversation
and
his
lip
quivered
but
he
was
determined
not
to
give
way
he
would
behave
like
a
man
maggie
on
the
contrary
after
her
momentary
delight
in
speech
had
relapsed
into
her
state
of
trembling
indignation
her
mother
had
been
standing
close
by
tom
side
and
had
been
clinging
to
his
arm
ever
since
he
had
last
spoken
maggie
suddenly
started
up
and
stood
in
front
of
them
her
eyes
flashing
like
the
eyes
of
a
young
lioness
why
do
you
come
then
she
burst
out
talking
and
interfering
with
us
and
scolding
us
if
you
do
mean
to
do
anything
to
help
my
poor
mother
your
own
sister
if
you
no
feeling
for
her
when
she
in
trouble
and
wo
part
with
anything
though
you
would
never
miss
it
to
save
her
from
pain
keep
away
from
us
then
and
do
come
to
find
fault
with
my
father
he
was
better
than
any
of
you
he
was
kind
he
would
have
helped
if
you
had
been
in
trouble
tom
and
i
ever
want
to
have
any
of
your
money
if
you
wo
help
my
mother
rather
not
have
it
we
do
without
you
maggie
having
hurled
her
defiance
at
aunts
and
uncles
in
this
way
stood
still
with
her
large
dark
eyes
glaring
at
them
as
if
she
were
ready
to
await
all
consequences
tulliver
was
frightened
there
was
something
portentous
in
this
mad
outbreak
she
did
not
see
how
life
could
go
on
after
it
tom
was
vexed
it
was
no
to
talk
so
the
aunts
were
silent
with
surprise
for
some
moments
at
length
in
a
case
of
aberration
such
as
this
comment
presented
itself
as
more
expedient
than
any
answer
you
have
seen
the
end
o
your
trouble
wi
that
child
bessy
said
pullet
she
beyond
everything
for
boldness
and
unthankfulness
it
dreadful
i
might
ha
let
alone
paying
for
her
schooling
for
she
worse
nor
ever
it
no
more
than
what
i
allays
said
followed
glegg
other
folks
may
be
surprised
but
i
not
i
said
over
and
over
again
years
ago
i
said
my
words
that
child
come
to
no
good
there
is
a
bit
of
our
family
in
her
and
as
for
her
having
so
much
schooling
i
never
thought
well
o
that
i
my
reasons
when
i
said
would
pay
anything
toward
it
come
come
said
glegg
let
waste
no
more
time
in
talking
let
go
to
business
tom
now
get
the
pen
and
ink
while
glegg
was
speaking
a
tall
dark
figure
was
seen
hurrying
past
the
window
why
there
moss
said
tulliver
the
bad
news
must
reached
her
then
and
she
went
out
to
open
the
door
maggie
eagerly
following
her
that
fortunate
said
glegg
she
can
agree
to
the
list
things
to
be
bought
in
it
but
right
she
should
do
her
share
when
it
her
own
brother
moss
was
in
too
much
agitation
to
resist
movement
as
she
drew
her
into
the
parlor
automatically
without
reflecting
that
it
was
hardly
kind
to
take
her
among
so
many
persons
in
the
first
painful
moment
of
arrival
the
tall
worn
woman
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
dodson
sisters
as
she
entered
in
her
shabby
dress
with
her
shawl
and
bonnet
looking
as
if
they
had
been
hastily
huddled
on
and
with
that
entire
absence
of
which
belongs
to
keenly
felt
trouble
maggie
was
clinging
to
her
arm
and
moss
seemed
to
notice
no
one
else
except
tom
whom
she
went
straight
up
to
and
took
by
the
hand
oh
my
dear
children
she
burst
out
you
no
call
to
think
well
o
me
i
a
poor
aunt
to
you
for
i
one
o
them
as
take
all
and
give
nothing
how
my
poor
brother
turnbull
thinks
he
get
better
said
maggie
sit
down
aunt
gritty
do
fret
oh
my
sweet
child
i
feel
torn
i
two
said
moss
allowing
maggie
to
lead
her
to
the
sofa
but
still
not
seeming
to
notice
the
presence
of
the
rest
we
three
hundred
pounds
o
my
money
and
now
he
wants
it
and
you
all
want
it
poor
things
and
yet
we
must
be
sold
up
to
pay
it
and
there
my
poor
children
eight
of
and
the
little
un
of
all
ca
speak
plain
and
i
feel
as
if
i
was
a
robber
but
i
sure
i
no
thought
as
my
brother
the
poor
woman
was
interrupted
by
a
rising
sob
three
hundred
pounds
oh
dear
dear
said
tulliver
who
when
she
had
said
that
her
husband
had
done
unknown
things
for
his
sister
had
not
had
any
particular
sum
in
her
mind
and
felt
a
irritation
at
having
been
kept
in
the
dark
what
madness
to
be
sure
said
glegg
a
man
with
a
family
he
no
right
to
lend
his
money
i
that
way
and
without
security
i
be
bound
if
the
truth
was
known
glegg
voice
had
arrested
moss
attention
and
looking
up
she
said
yes
there
security
my
husband
gave
a
note
for
it
we
not
that
sort
o
people
neither
of
us
as
rob
my
brother
children
and
we
looked
to
paying
back
the
money
when
the
times
got
a
bit
better
well
but
now
said
glegg
gently
has
your
husband
no
way
o
raising
this
money
because
it
be
a
little
fortin
like
for
these
folks
if
we
can
do
without
tulliver
being
made
a
bankrupt
your
husband
got
stock
it
is
but
right
he
should
raise
the
money
as
it
seems
to
me
not
but
what
i
sorry
for
you
mrs
moss
oh
sir
you
do
know
what
bad
luck
my
husband
had
with
his
stock
the
farm
suffering
so
as
never
was
for
want
o
stock
and
we
sold
all
the
wheat
and
we
behind
with
our
rent
not
but
what
we
like
to
do
what
right
and
i
sit
up
and
work
half
the
night
if
it
be
any
good
but
there
them
poor
children
four
of
such
little
uns
do
cry
so
aunt
do
fret
whispered
maggie
who
had
kept
hold
of
moss
hand
did
tulliver
let
you
have
the
money
all
at
once
said
tulliver
still
lost
in
the
conception
of
things
which
had
been
going
on
without
her
knowledge
no
at
twice
said
moss
rubbing
her
eyes
and
making
an
effort
to
restrain
her
tears
the
last
was
after
my
bad
illness
four
years
ago
as
everything
went
wrong
and
there
was
a
new
note
made
then
what
with
illness
and
bad
luck
i
been
nothing
but
cumber
all
my
life
yes
moss
said
glegg
with
decision
yours
is
a
very
unlucky
family
the
more
the
pity
for
sister
i
set
off
in
the
cart
as
soon
as
ever
i
heard
o
what
had
happened
said
moss
looking
at
tulliver
i
should
never
ha
stayed
away
all
this
while
if
you
thought
well
to
let
me
know
and
it
is
as
i
thinking
all
about
ourselves
and
nothing
about
my
brother
only
the
money
was
so
on
my
mind
i
could
help
speaking
about
it
and
my
husband
and
me
desire
to
do
the
right
thing
sir
she
added
looking
at
glegg
and
we
make
shift
and
pay
the
money
come
what
will
if
that
all
my
brother
got
to
trust
to
we
been
used
to
trouble
and
do
look
for
much
else
it
only
the
thought
o
my
poor
children
pulls
me
i
two
why
there
this
to
be
thought
on
moss
said
glegg
and
it
right
to
warn
you
if
tulliver
made
a
bankrupt
and
he
got
a
of
your
husband
for
three
hundred
pounds
you
be
obliged
to
pay
it
th
assignees
come
on
you
for
it
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
tulliver
thinking
of
the
bankruptcy
and
not
of
moss
concern
in
it
poor
moss
herself
listened
in
trembling
submission
while
maggie
looked
with
bewildered
distress
at
tom
to
see
if
showed
any
signs
of
understanding
this
trouble
and
caring
about
poor
aunt
moss
tom
was
only
looking
thoughtful
with
his
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
and
if
he
is
made
bankrupt
continued
glegg
as
i
said
before
three
hundred
pounds
be
a
little
fortin
for
him
poor
man
we
do
know
but
what
he
may
be
partly
helpless
if
he
ever
gets
up
again
i
very
sorry
if
it
goes
hard
with
you
moss
but
my
opinion
is
looking
at
it
one
way
it
be
right
for
you
to
raise
the
money
and
looking
at
it
th
other
way
you
be
obliged
to
pay
it
you
wo
think
ill
o
me
for
speaking
the
truth
uncle
said
tom
looking
up
suddenly
from
his
meditative
view
of
the
tablecloth
i
do
think
it
would
be
right
for
my
aunt
moss
to
pay
the
money
if
it
would
be
against
my
father
will
for
her
to
pay
it
would
it
glegg
looked
surprised
for
a
moment
or
two
before
he
said
why
no
perhaps
not
tom
but
then
he
ha
destroyed
the
note
you
know
we
must
look
for
the
note
what
makes
you
think
it
be
against
his
will
why
said
tom
coloring
but
trying
to
speak
firmly
in
spite
of
a
boyish
tremor
i
remember
quite
well
before
i
went
to
school
to
stelling
my
father
said
to
me
one
night
when
we
were
sitting
by
the
fire
together
and
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
tom
hesitated
a
little
and
then
went
on
he
said
something
to
me
about
maggie
and
then
he
said
always
been
good
to
my
sister
though
she
married
against
my
will
and
lent
moss
money
but
i
shall
never
think
of
distressing
him
to
pay
it
i
rather
lose
it
my
children
must
not
mind
being
the
poorer
for
that
and
now
my
father
ill
and
not
able
to
speak
for
himself
i
should
like
anything
to
be
done
contrary
to
what
he
said
to
me
well
but
then
my
boy
said
uncle
glegg
whose
good
feeling
led
him
to
enter
into
tom
wish
but
who
could
not
at
once
shake
off
his
habitual
abhorrence
of
such
recklessness
as
destroying
securities
or
alienating
anything
important
enough
to
make
an
appreciable
difference
in
a
man
property
we
should
have
to
make
away
wi
the
note
you
know
if
we
to
guard
against
what
may
happen
supposing
your
father
made
bankrupt
glegg
interrupted
his
wife
severely
mind
what
you
saying
you
putting
yourself
very
forrard
in
other
folks
business
if
you
speak
rash
do
say
it
was
my
fault
that
such
a
thing
as
i
never
heared
of
before
said
uncle
pullet
who
had
been
making
haste
with
his
lozenge
in
order
to
express
his
amazement
making
away
with
a
note
i
should
think
anybody
could
set
the
constable
on
you
for
it
well
but
said
tulliver
if
the
note
worth
all
that
money
why
ca
we
pay
it
away
and
save
my
things
from
going
away
we
no
call
to
meddle
with
your
uncle
and
aunt
moss
tom
if
you
think
your
father
be
angry
when
he
gets
well
tulliver
had
not
studied
the
question
of
exchange
and
was
straining
her
mind
after
original
ideas
on
the
subject
pooh
pooh
pooh
you
women
do
understand
these
things
said
uncle
glegg
there
no
way
o
making
it
safe
for
and
moss
but
destroying
the
note
then
i
hope
you
help
me
do
it
uncle
said
tom
earnestly
if
my
father
should
get
well
i
should
be
very
unhappy
to
think
anything
had
been
done
against
his
will
that
i
could
hinder
and
i
sure
he
meant
me
to
remember
what
he
said
that
evening
i
ought
to
obey
my
father
wish
about
his
property
even
glegg
could
not
withhold
her
approval
from
tom
words
she
felt
that
the
dodson
blood
was
certainly
speaking
in
him
though
if
his
father
had
been
a
dodson
there
would
never
have
been
this
wicked
alienation
of
money
maggie
would
hardly
have
restrained
herself
from
leaping
on
tom
neck
if
her
aunt
moss
had
not
prevented
her
by
herself
rising
and
taking
tom
hand
while
she
said
with
rather
a
choked
voice
you
never
be
the
poorer
for
this
my
dear
boy
if
there
a
god
above
and
if
the
money
wanted
for
your
father
moss
and
me
pay
it
the
same
as
if
there
was
ever
such
security
we
do
as
we
be
done
by
for
if
my
children
have
got
no
other
luck
they
got
an
honest
father
and
mother
well
said
glegg
who
had
been
meditating
after
tom
words
we
should
be
doing
any
wrong
by
the
creditors
supposing
your
father
bankrupt
i
been
thinking
o
that
for
i
been
a
creditor
myself
and
seen
no
end
o
cheating
if
he
meant
to
give
your
aunt
the
money
before
ever
he
got
into
this
sad
work
o
lawing
it
the
same
as
if
he
made
away
with
the
note
himself
for
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
that
much
poorer
but
there
a
deal
o
things
to
be
considered
young
man
glegg
added
looking
admonishingly
at
tom
when
you
come
to
money
business
and
you
may
be
taking
one
man
dinner
away
to
make
another
man
breakfast
you
do
understand
that
i
doubt
yes
i
do
said
tom
decidedly
i
know
if
i
owe
money
to
one
man
i
no
right
to
give
it
to
another
but
if
my
father
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
my
aunt
the
money
before
he
was
in
debt
he
had
a
right
to
do
it
well
done
young
man
i
did
think
you
been
so
sharp
said
uncle
glegg
with
much
candor
but
perhaps
your
father
make
away
with
the
note
let
us
go
and
see
if
we
can
find
it
in
the
chest
it
in
my
father
room
let
us
go
too

chapter
iv
a
vanishing
gleam
tulliver
even
between
the
fits
of
spasmodic
rigidity
which
had
recurred
at
intervals
ever
since
he
had
been
found
fallen
from
his
horse
was
usually
in
so
apathetic
a
condition
that
the
exits
and
entrances
into
his
room
were
not
felt
to
be
of
great
importance
he
had
lain
so
still
with
his
eyes
closed
all
this
morning
that
maggie
told
her
aunt
moss
she
must
not
expect
her
father
to
take
any
notice
of
them
they
entered
very
quietly
and
moss
took
her
seat
near
the
head
of
the
bed
while
maggie
sat
in
her
old
place
on
the
bed
and
put
her
hand
on
her
father
without
causing
any
change
in
his
face
glegg
and
tom
had
also
entered
treading
softly
and
were
busy
selecting
the
key
of
the
old
oak
chest
from
the
bunch
which
tom
had
brought
from
his
father
bureau
they
succeeded
in
opening
the
chest
which
stood
opposite
the
foot
of
tulliver
bed
and
propping
the
lid
with
the
iron
holder
without
much
noise
there
a
tin
box
whispered
glegg
he
most
like
put
a
small
thing
like
a
note
in
there
lift
it
out
tom
but
i
just
lift
up
these
deeds
they
the
deeds
o
the
house
and
mill
i
suppose
and
see
what
there
is
under
glegg
had
lifted
out
the
parchments
and
had
fortunately
drawn
back
a
little
when
the
iron
holder
gave
way
and
the
heavy
lid
fell
with
a
loud
bang
that
resounded
over
the
house
perhaps
there
was
something
in
that
sound
more
than
the
mere
fact
of
the
strong
vibration
that
produced
the
instantaneous
effect
on
the
frame
of
the
prostrate
man
and
for
the
time
completely
shook
off
the
obstruction
of
paralysis
the
chest
had
belonged
to
his
father
and
his
father
father
and
it
had
always
been
rather
a
solemn
business
to
visit
it
all
objects
even
a
mere
window
fastening
or
a
particular
have
sounds
which
are
a
sort
of
recognized
voice
to
us
a
voice
that
will
thrill
and
awaken
when
it
has
been
used
to
touch
fibres
in
the
same
moment
when
all
the
eyes
in
the
room
were
turned
upon
him
he
started
up
and
looked
at
the
chest
the
parchments
in
glegg
hand
and
tom
holding
the
tin
box
with
a
glance
of
perfect
consciousness
and
recognition
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
deeds
he
said
in
his
ordinary
tone
of
sharp
questioning
whenever
he
was
irritated
come
here
tom
what
do
you
do
going
to
my
chest
tom
obeyed
with
some
trembling
it
was
the
first
time
his
father
had
recognized
him
but
instead
of
saying
anything
more
to
him
his
father
continued
to
look
with
a
growing
distinctness
of
suspicion
at
glegg
and
the
deeds
what
been
happening
then
he
said
sharply
what
are
you
meddling
with
my
deeds
for
is
wakem
laying
hold
of
everything
why
do
you
tell
me
what
you
been
he
added
impatiently
as
glegg
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
before
speaking
no
no
friend
tulliver
said
glegg
in
a
soothing
tone
nobody
getting
hold
of
anything
as
yet
we
only
came
to
look
and
see
what
was
in
the
chest
you
been
ill
you
know
and
we
had
to
look
after
things
a
bit
but
let
hope
you
soon
be
well
enough
to
attend
to
everything
yourself
tulliver
looked
around
him
meditatively
at
tom
at
glegg
and
at
maggie
then
suddenly
appearing
aware
that
some
one
was
seated
by
his
side
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
turned
sharply
round
and
saw
his
sister
eh
gritty
he
said
in
the
affectionate
tone
in
which
he
had
been
wont
to
speak
to
her
what
you
there
are
you
how
could
you
manage
to
leave
the
children
oh
brother
said
good
moss
too
impulsive
to
be
prudent
thankful
i
come
now
to
see
you
yourself
again
i
thought
you
never
know
us
any
more
what
have
i
had
a
stroke
said
tulliver
anxiously
looking
at
glegg
a
fall
from
your
horse
shook
you
a
bit
that
all
i
think
said
glegg
but
you
soon
get
over
it
let
hope
tulliver
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
and
remained
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
a
new
shadow
came
over
his
face
he
looked
up
at
maggie
first
and
said
in
a
lower
tone
you
got
the
letter
then
my
wench
yes
father
she
said
kissing
him
with
a
full
heart
she
felt
as
if
her
father
were
come
back
to
her
from
the
dead
and
her
yearning
to
show
him
how
she
had
always
loved
him
could
be
fulfilled
where
your
mother
he
said
so
preoccupied
that
he
received
the
kiss
as
passively
as
some
quiet
animal
might
have
received
it
she
downstairs
with
my
aunts
father
shall
i
fetch
her
ay
ay
poor
bessy
and
his
eyes
turned
toward
tom
as
maggie
left
the
room
you
have
to
take
care
of
both
if
i
die
you
know
tom
be
badly
off
i
doubt
but
you
must
see
and
pay
everybody
and
mind
there
fifty
pound
o
luke
as
i
put
into
the
business
he
gave
me
a
bit
at
a
time
and
he
got
nothing
to
show
for
it
you
must
pay
him
first
thing
uncle
glegg
involuntarily
shook
his
head
and
looked
more
concerned
than
ever
but
tom
said
firmly
yes
father
and
have
you
a
note
from
my
uncle
moss
for
three
hundred
pounds
we
came
to
look
for
that
what
do
you
wish
to
be
done
about
it
father
ah
i
glad
you
thought
o
that
my
lad
said
tulliver
i
allays
meant
to
be
easy
about
that
money
because
o
your
aunt
you
must
mind
losing
the
money
if
they
ca
pay
it
and
it
like
enough
they
ca
the
note
in
that
box
mind
i
allays
meant
to
be
good
to
you
gritty
said
tulliver
turning
to
his
sister
but
you
know
you
aggravated
me
when
you
would
have
moss
at
this
moment
maggie
with
her
mother
who
came
in
much
agitated
by
the
news
that
her
husband
was
quite
himself
again
well
bessy
he
said
as
she
kissed
him
you
must
forgive
me
if
you
worse
off
than
you
ever
expected
to
be
but
it
the
fault
the
law
it
none
o
mine
he
added
angrily
it
the
fault
raskills
tom
you
mind
this
if
ever
you
got
the
chance
you
make
wakem
smart
if
you
do
you
a
son
you
might
him
but
he
set
the
law
on
you
the
law
made
to
take
care
o
raskills
tulliver
was
getting
excited
and
an
alarming
flush
was
on
his
face
glegg
wanted
to
say
something
soothing
but
he
was
prevented
by
tulliver
speaking
again
to
his
wife
they
make
a
shift
to
pay
everything
bessy
he
said
and
yet
leave
you
your
furniture
and
your
sisters
do
something
for
you
and
tom
grow
up
though
what
he
to
be
i
do
know
i
done
what
i
could
i
given
him
a
eddication
and
there
the
little
wench
she
get
married
but
a
poor
tale
the
sanative
effect
of
the
strong
vibration
was
exhausted
and
with
the
last
words
the
poor
man
fell
again
rigid
and
insensible
though
this
was
only
a
recurrence
of
what
had
happened
before
it
struck
all
present
as
if
it
had
been
death
not
only
from
its
contrast
with
the
completeness
of
the
revival
but
because
his
words
had
all
had
reference
to
the
possibility
that
his
death
was
near
but
with
poor
tulliver
death
was
not
to
be
a
leap
it
was
to
be
a
long
descent
under
thickening
shadows
turnbull
was
sent
for
but
when
he
heard
what
had
passed
he
said
this
complete
restoration
though
only
temporary
was
a
hopeful
sign
proving
that
there
was
no
permanent
lesion
to
prevent
ultimate
recovery
among
the
threads
of
the
past
which
the
stricken
man
had
gathered
up
he
had
omitted
the
bill
of
sale
the
flash
of
memory
had
only
lit
up
prominent
ideas
and
he
sank
into
forgetfulness
again
with
half
his
humiliation
unlearned
but
tom
was
clear
upon
two
points
that
his
uncle
moss
note
must
be
destroyed
and
that
luke
money
must
be
paid
if
in
no
other
way
out
of
his
own
and
maggie
money
now
in
the
savings
bank
there
were
subjects
you
perceive
on
which
tom
was
much
quicker
than
on
the
niceties
of
classical
construction
or
the
relations
of
a
mathematical
demonstration

way
to
ogg
to
see
his
uncle
deane
who
was
to
come
home
last
night
his
aunt
had
said
and
tom
had
made
up
his
mind
that
his
uncle
deane
was
the
right
person
to
ask
for
advice
about
getting
some
employment
he
was
in
a
great
way
of
business
he
had
not
the
narrow
notions
of
uncle
glegg
and
he
had
risen
in
the
world
on
a
scale
of
advancement
which
accorded
with
ambition
it
was
a
dark
chill
misty
morning
likely
to
end
in
rain
one
of
those
mornings
when
even
happy
people
take
refuge
in
their
hopes
and
tom
was
very
unhappy
he
felt
the
humiliation
as
well
as
the
prospective
hardships
of
his
lot
with
all
the
keenness
of
a
proud
nature
and
with
all
his
resolute
dutifulness
toward
his
father
there
mingled
an
irrepressible
indignation
against
him
which
gave
misfortune
the
less
endurable
aspect
of
a
wrong
since
these
were
the
consequences
of
going
to
law
his
father
was
really
blamable
as
his
aunts
and
uncles
had
always
said
he
was
and
it
was
a
significant
indication
of
tom
character
that
though
he
thought
his
aunts
ought
to
do
something
more
for
his
mother
he
felt
nothing
like
violent
resentment
against
them
for
showing
no
eager
tenderness
and
generosity
there
were
no
impulses
in
tom
that
led
him
to
expect
what
did
not
present
itself
to
him
as
a
right
to
be
demanded
why
should
people
give
away
their
money
plentifully
to
those
who
had
not
taken
care
of
their
own
money
tom
saw
some
justice
in
severity
and
all
the
more
because
he
had
confidence
in
himself
that
he
should
never
deserve
that
just
severity
it
was
very
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
be
put
at
this
disadvantage
in
life
by
his
father
want
of
prudence
but
he
was
not
going
to
complain
and
to
find
fault
with
people
because
they
did
not
make
everything
easy
for
him
he
would
ask
no
one
to
help
him
more
than
to
give
him
work
and
pay
him
for
it
poor
tom
was
not
without
his
hopes
to
take
refuge
in
under
the
chill
damp
imprisonment
of
the
december
fog
which
seemed
only
like
a
part
of
his
home
troubles
at
sixteen
the
mind
that
has
the
strongest
affinity
for
fact
can
not
escape
illusion
and
and
tom
in
sketching
his
future
had
no
other
guide
in
arranging
his
facts
than
the
suggestions
of
his
own
brave
both
glegg
and
deane
he
knew
had
been
very
poor
once
he
did
not
want
to
save
money
slowly
and
retire
on
a
moderate
fortune
like
his
uncle
glegg
but
he
would
be
like
his
uncle
deane
get
a
situation
in
some
great
house
of
business
and
rise
fast
he
had
scarcely
seen
anything
of
his
uncle
deane
for
the
last
three
years
the
two
families
had
been
getting
wider
apart
but
for
this
very
reason
tom
was
the
more
hopeful
about
applying
to
him
his
uncle
glegg
he
felt
sure
would
never
encourage
any
spirited
project
but
he
had
a
vague
imposing
idea
of
the
resources
at
his
uncle
deane
command
he
had
heard
his
father
say
long
ago
how
deane
had
made
himself
so
valuable
to
guest
that
they
were
glad
enough
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
that
was
what
tom
resolved
would
do
it
was
intolerable
to
think
of
being
poor
and
looked
down
upon
all
one
life
he
would
provide
for
his
mother
and
sister
and
make
every
one
say
that
he
was
a
man
of
high
character
he
leaped
over
the
years
in
this
way
and
in
the
haste
of
strong
purpose
and
strong
desire
did
not
see
how
they
would
be
made
up
of
slow
days
hours
and
minutes
by
the
time
he
had
crossed
the
stone
bridge
over
the
floss
and
was
entering
ogg
he
was
thinking
that
he
would
buy
his
mill
and
land
again
when
he
was
rich
enough
and
improve
the
house
and
live
there
he
should
prefer
it
to
any
smarter
newer
place
and
he
could
keep
as
many
horses
and
dogs
as
he
liked
walking
along
the
street
with
a
firm
rapid
step
at
this
point
in
his
reverie
he
was
startled
by
some
one
who
had
crossed
without
his
notice
and
who
said
to
him
in
a
rough
familiar
voice
why
master
tom
how
your
father
this
morning
it
was
a
publican
of
ogg
one
of
his
father
customers
tom
disliked
being
spoken
to
just
then
but
he
said
civilly
still
very
ill
thank
you
ay
it
been
a
sore
chance
for
you
young
man
has
it
this
lawsuit
turning
out
against
him
said
the
publican
with
a
confused
beery
idea
of
being
tom
reddened
and
passed
on
he
would
have
felt
it
like
the
handling
of
a
bruise
even
if
there
had
been
the
most
polite
and
delicate
reference
to
his
position
that
tulliver
son
said
the
publican
to
a
grocer
standing
on
the
adjacent
ah
said
the
grocer
i
thought
i
knew
his
features
he
takes
after
his
mother
family
she
was
a
dodson
he
a
fine
straight
youth
what
he
been
brought
up
to
oh
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
his
father
customers
and
be
a
fine
gentleman
not
much
else
i
think
tom
roused
from
his
dream
of
the
future
to
a
thorough
consciousness
of
the
present
made
all
the
greater
haste
to
reach
the
warehouse
offices
of
guest
where
he
expected
to
find
his
uncle
deane
but
this
was
deane
morning
at
the
band
a
clerk
told
him
and
with
some
contempt
for
his
ignorance
deane
was
not
to
be
found
in
river
street
on
a
thursday
morning
at
the
bank
tom
was
admitted
into
the
private
room
where
his
uncle
was
immediately
after
sending
in
his
name
deane
was
auditing
accounts
but
he
looked
up
as
tom
entered
and
putting
out
his
hand
said
well
tom
nothing
fresh
the
matter
at
home
i
hope
how
your
father
much
the
same
thank
you
uncle
said
tom
feeling
nervous
but
i
want
to
speak
to
you
please
when
you
at
liberty
sit
down
sit
down
said
deane
relapsing
into
his
accounts
in
which
he
and
the
remained
so
absorbed
for
the
next
that
tom
began
to
wonder
whether
he
should
have
to
sit
in
this
way
till
the
bank
closed
there
seemed
so
little
tendency
toward
a
conclusion
in
the
quiet
monotonous
procedure
of
these
sleek
prosperous
men
of
business
would
his
uncle
give
him
a
place
in
the
bank
it
would
be
very
dull
prosy
work
he
thought
writing
there
forever
to
the
loud
ticking
of
a
timepiece
he
preferred
some
other
way
of
getting
rich
but
at
last
there
was
a
change
his
uncle
took
a
pen
and
wrote
something
with
a
flourish
at
the
end
you
just
step
up
to
torry
now
spence
will
you
said
deane
and
the
clock
suddenly
became
less
loud
and
deliberate
in
ears
well
tom
said
deane
when
they
were
alone
turning
his
substantial
person
a
little
in
his
chair
and
taking
out
his
what
the
business
my
boy
what
the
business
deane
who
had
heard
from
his
wife
what
had
passed
the
day
before
thought
tom
was
come
to
appeal
to
him
for
some
means
of
averting
the
sale
i
hope
you
excuse
me
for
troubling
you
uncle
said
tom
coloring
but
speaking
in
a
tone
which
though
tremulous
had
a
certain
proud
independence
in
it
but
i
thought
you
were
the
best
person
to
advise
me
what
to
do
ah
said
deane
reserving
his
pinch
of
snuff
and
looking
at
tom
with
new
attention
let
us
hear
i
want
to
get
a
situation
uncle
so
that
i
may
earn
some
money
said
tom
who
never
fell
into
circumlocution
a
situation
said
deane
and
then
took
his
pinch
of
snuff
with
elaborate
justice
to
each
nostril
tom
thought
a
most
provoking
habit
why
let
me
see
how
old
are
you
said
deane
as
he
threw
himself
backward
again
sixteen
i
mean
i
am
going
in
seventeen
said
tom
hoping
his
uncle
noticed
how
much
beard
he
had
let
me
see
your
father
had
some
notion
of
making
you
an
engineer
i
think
but
i
do
think
i
could
get
any
money
at
that
for
a
long
while
could
i
that
true
but
people
do
get
much
money
at
anything
my
boy
when
they
only
sixteen
you
had
a
good
deal
of
schooling
however
i
suppose
you
pretty
well
up
in
accounts
eh
you
understand
book
keeping
no
said
tom
rather
falteringly
i
was
in
practice
but
stelling
says
i
write
a
good
hand
uncle
that
my
writing
added
tom
laying
on
the
table
a
copy
of
the
list
he
had
made
yesterday
ah
that
good
that
good
but
you
see
the
best
hand
in
the
world
not
get
you
a
better
place
than
a
if
you
know
nothing
of
nothing
of
accounts
and
a
a
cheap
article
but
what
have
you
been
learning
at
school
then
deane
had
not
occupied
himself
with
methods
of
education
and
had
no
precise
conception
of
what
went
forward
in
expensive
schools
we
learned
latin
said
tom
pausing
a
little
between
each
item
as
if
he
were
turning
over
the
books
in
his
to
assist
his
memory
a
good
deal
of
latin
and
the
last
year
i
did
themes
one
week
in
latin
and
one
in
english
and
greek
and
roman
history
and
euclid
and
i
began
algebra
but
i
left
it
off
again
and
we
had
one
day
every
week
for
arithmetic
then
i
used
to
have
and
there
were
several
other
books
we
either
read
or
learned
out
of
english
poetry
and
horæ
paulinæ
and
blair
rhetoric
the
last
half
deane
tapped
his
again
and
screwed
up
his
mouth
he
felt
in
the
position
of
many
estimable
persons
when
they
had
read
the
new
tariff
and
found
how
many
commodities
were
imported
of
which
they
knew
nothing
like
a
cautious
man
of
business
he
was
not
going
to
speak
rashly
of
a
raw
material
in
which
he
had
had
no
experience
but
the
presumption
was
that
if
it
had
been
good
for
anything
so
successful
a
man
as
himself
would
hardly
have
been
ignorant
of
it
about
latin
he
had
an
opinion
and
thought
that
in
case
of
another
war
since
people
would
no
longer
wear
it
would
be
well
to
put
a
tax
upon
latin
as
a
luxury
much
run
upon
by
the
higher
classes
and
not
telling
at
all
on
the
department
but
for
what
he
knew
the
horæ
paulinæ
might
be
something
less
neutral
on
the
whole
this
list
of
acquirements
gave
him
a
sort
of
repulsion
toward
poor
tom
well
he
said
at
last
in
rather
a
cold
sardonic
tone
you
had
three
years
at
these
things
you
must
be
pretty
strong
in
you
better
take
up
some
line
where
they
come
in
handy
tom
colored
and
burst
out
with
new
energy
i
rather
not
have
any
employment
of
that
sort
uncle
i
do
like
latin
and
those
things
i
do
know
what
i
could
do
with
them
unless
i
went
as
usher
in
a
school
and
i
do
know
them
well
enough
for
that
besides
i
would
as
soon
carry
a
pair
of
panniers
i
do
want
to
be
that
sort
of
person
i
should
like
to
enter
into
some
business
where
i
can
get
on
a
manly
business
where
i
should
have
to
look
after
things
and
get
credit
for
what
i
did
and
i
shall
want
to
keep
my
mother
and
sister
ah
young
gentleman
said
deane
with
that
tendency
to
repress
youthful
hopes
which
stout
and
successful
men
of
fifty
find
one
of
their
easiest
duties
that
sooner
said
than
done
sooner
said
than
done
but
did
get
on
in
that
way
uncle
said
tom
a
little
irritated
that
deane
did
not
enter
more
rapidly
into
his
views
i
mean
did
you
rise
from
one
place
to
another
through
your
abilities
and
good
conduct
ay
ay
sir
said
deane
spreading
himself
in
his
chair
a
little
and
entering
with
great
readiness
into
a
retrospect
of
his
own
career
but
i
tell
you
how
i
got
on
it
was
by
getting
astride
a
stick
and
thinking
it
would
turn
into
a
horse
if
i
sat
on
it
long
enough
i
kept
my
eyes
and
ears
open
sir
and
i
was
too
fond
of
my
own
back
and
i
made
my
master
interest
my
own
why
with
only
looking
into
what
went
on
in
the
mill
i
found
out
how
there
was
a
waste
of
five
hundred
that
might
be
hindered
why
sir
i
had
more
schooling
to
begin
with
than
a
charity
boy
but
i
saw
pretty
soon
that
i
could
get
on
far
enough
without
mastering
accounts
and
i
learned
between
working
hours
after
i
been
unlading
look
here
deane
opened
a
book
and
pointed
to
the
page
i
write
a
good
hand
enough
and
i
match
anybody
at
all
sorts
of
reckoning
by
the
head
and
i
got
it
all
by
hard
work
and
paid
for
it
out
of
my
own
earnings
often
out
of
my
own
dinner
and
supper
and
i
looked
into
the
nature
of
all
the
things
we
had
to
do
in
the
business
and
picked
up
knowledge
as
i
went
about
my
work
and
turned
it
over
in
my
head
why
i
no
mechanic
i
never
pretended
to
be
but
thought
of
a
thing
or
two
that
the
mechanics
never
thought
of
and
it
made
a
fine
difference
in
our
returns
and
there
is
an
article
shipped
or
unshipped
at
our
wharf
but
i
know
the
quality
of
it
if
i
got
places
sir
it
was
because
i
made
myself
fit
for
if
you
want
to
slip
into
a
round
hole
you
must
make
a
ball
of
yourself
where
it
is
deane
tapped
his
box
again
he
had
been
led
on
by
pure
enthusiasm
in
his
subject
and
had
really
forgotten
what
bearing
this
retrospective
survey
had
on
his
listener
he
had
found
occasion
for
saying
the
same
thing
more
than
once
before
and
was
not
distinctly
aware
that
he
had
not
his
before
him
well
uncle
said
tom
with
a
slight
complaint
in
his
tone
what
i
should
like
to
do
ca
get
on
in
the
same
way
in
the
same
way
said
deane
eyeing
tom
with
quiet
deliberation
there
go
two
or
three
questions
to
that
master
tom
that
depends
on
what
sort
of
material
you
are
to
begin
with
and
whether
you
been
put
into
the
right
mill
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
your
poor
father
went
the
wrong
way
to
work
in
giving
you
an
education
it
was
my
business
and
i
did
interfere
but
it
is
as
i
thought
it
would
be
you
had
a
sort
of
learning
that
all
very
well
for
a
young
fellow
like
our
stephen
guest
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
sign
checks
all
his
life
and
may
as
well
have
latin
inside
his
head
as
any
other
sort
of
stuffing
but
uncle
said
tom
earnestly
i
do
see
why
the
latin
need
hinder
me
from
getting
on
in
business
i
shall
soon
forget
it
all
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
i
had
to
do
my
lessons
at
school
but
i
always
thought
they
never
be
of
any
use
to
me
afterward
i
care
about
them
ay
ay
that
all
very
well
said
deane
but
it
does
alter
what
i
was
going
to
say
your
latin
and
rigmarole
may
soon
dry
off
you
but
you
be
but
a
bare
stick
after
that
besides
it
whitened
your
hands
and
taken
the
rough
work
out
of
you
and
what
do
you
know
why
you
know
nothing
about
to
begin
with
and
not
so
much
of
reckoning
as
a
common
shopman
you
have
to
begin
at
a
low
round
of
the
ladder
let
me
tell
you
if
you
mean
to
get
on
in
life
it
no
use
forgetting
the
education
your
father
been
paying
for
if
you
do
give
yourself
a
new
un
tom
bit
his
lips
hard
he
felt
as
if
the
tears
were
rising
and
he
would
rather
die
than
let
them
you
want
me
to
help
you
to
a
situation
deane
went
on
well
i
no
fault
to
find
with
that
i
willing
to
do
something
for
you
but
you
youngsters
nowadays
think
you
to
begin
with
living
well
and
working
easy
you
no
notion
of
running
afoot
before
you
get
horseback
now
you
must
remember
what
you
are
you
a
lad
of
sixteen
trained
to
nothing
particular
there
heaps
of
your
sort
like
so
many
pebbles
made
to
fit
in
nowhere
well
you
might
be
apprenticed
to
some
business
a
chemist
and
druggist
perhaps
your
latin
might
come
in
a
bit
there
tom
was
going
to
speak
but
deane
put
up
his
hand
and
said
stop
hear
what
i
got
to
say
you
do
want
to
be
a
i
know
i
know
you
want
to
make
more
haste
and
you
do
want
to
stand
behind
a
counter
but
if
you
a
you
have
to
stand
behind
a
desk
and
stare
at
your
ink
and
paper
all
day
there
is
much
there
and
you
wo
be
much
wiser
at
the
end
of
the
year
than
at
the
beginning
the
world
is
made
of
pen
ink
and
paper
and
if
you
to
get
on
in
the
world
young
man
you
must
know
what
the
world
made
of
now
the
best
chance
for
you
be
to
have
a
place
on
a
wharf
or
in
a
warehouse
where
you
learn
the
smell
of
things
but
you
would
like
that
i
be
bound
you
have
to
stand
cold
and
wet
and
be
shouldered
about
by
rough
fellows
you
too
fine
a
gentleman
for
that
deane
paused
and
looked
hard
at
tom
who
certainly
felt
some
inward
struggle
before
he
could
reply
i
would
rather
do
what
will
be
best
for
me
in
the
end
sir
i
would
put
up
with
what
was
disagreeable
that
well
if
you
can
carry
it
out
but
you
must
remember
it
only
laying
hold
of
a
rope
you
must
go
on
pulling
it
the
mistake
you
lads
make
that
have
got
nothing
either
in
your
brains
or
your
pocket
to
think
you
got
a
better
start
in
the
world
if
you
stick
yourselves
in
a
place
where
you
can
keep
your
coats
clean
and
have
the
shopwenches
take
you
for
fine
gentlemen
that
was
the
way
started
young
man
when
i
was
sixteen
my
jacket
smelt
of
tar
and
i
was
afraid
of
handling
cheeses
that
the
reason
i
can
wear
good
broadcloth
now
and
have
my
legs
under
the
same
table
with
the
head
of
the
best
firms
in
st
ogg
uncle
deane
tapped
his
box
and
seemed
to
expand
a
little
under
his
waistcoat
and
gold
chain
as
he
squared
his
shoulders
in
the
chair
is
there
any
place
at
liberty
that
you
know
of
now
uncle
that
i
should
do
for
i
should
like
to
set
to
work
at
once
said
tom
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
stop
a
bit
stop
a
bit
we
must
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
you
must
bear
in
mind
if
i
put
you
in
a
place
you
a
bit
young
for
because
you
happen
to
be
my
nephew
i
shall
be
responsible
for
you
and
there
no
better
reason
you
know
than
your
being
my
nephew
because
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
you
good
for
anything
i
hope
i
shall
never
do
you
any
discredit
uncle
said
tom
hurt
as
all
boys
are
at
the
statement
of
the
unpleasant
truth
that
people
feel
no
ground
for
trusting
them
i
care
about
my
own
credit
too
much
for
that
well
done
tom
well
done
that
the
right
spirit
and
i
never
refuse
to
help
anybody
if
they
a
mind
to
do
themselves
justice
there
a
young
man
of
i
got
my
eye
on
now
i
shall
do
what
i
can
for
that
young
man
he
got
some
pith
in
him
but
then
you
see
he
made
good
use
of
his
time
a
calculator
can
tell
you
the
cubic
contents
of
anything
in
no
time
and
put
me
up
the
other
day
to
a
new
market
for
swedish
bark
he
uncommonly
knowing
in
manufactures
that
young
fellow
i
better
set
about
learning
had
i
uncle
said
tom
anxious
to
prove
his
readiness
to
exert
himself
yes
yes
you
ca
do
amiss
there
but
ah
spence
you
back
again
well
tom
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
just
now
i
think
and
i
must
go
to
business
again
remember
me
to
your
mother
deane
put
out
his
hand
with
an
air
of
friendly
dismissal
and
tom
had
not
courage
to
ask
another
question
especially
in
the
presence
of
spence
so
he
went
out
again
into
the
cold
damp
air
he
had
to
call
at
his
uncle
glegg
about
the
money
in
the
savings
bank
and
by
the
time
he
set
out
again
the
mist
had
thickened
and
he
could
not
see
very
far
before
him
but
going
along
river
street
again
he
was
startled
when
he
was
within
two
yards
of
the
projecting
side
of
a
by
the
words
dorlcote
mill
in
large
letters
on
a
placed
as
if
on
purpose
to
stare
at
him
it
was
the
catalogue
of
the
sale
to
take
place
the
next
week
it
was
a
reason
for
hurrying
faster
out
of
the
town
poor
tom
formed
no
visions
of
the
distant
future
as
he
made
his
way
homeward
he
only
felt
that
the
present
was
very
hard
it
seemed
a
wrong
toward
him
that
his
uncle
deane
had
no
confidence
in
him
did
not
see
at
once
that
he
should
acquit
himself
well
which
tom
himself
was
as
certain
of
as
of
the
daylight
apparently
he
tom
tulliver
was
likely
to
be
held
of
small
account
in
the
world
and
for
the
first
time
he
felt
a
sinking
of
heart
under
the
sense
that
he
really
was
very
ignorant
and
could
do
very
little
who
was
that
enviable
young
man
that
could
tell
the
cubic
contents
of
things
in
no
time
and
make
suggestions
about
swedish
bark
tom
had
been
used
to
be
so
entirely
satisfied
with
himself
in
spite
of
his
breaking
down
in
a
demonstration
and
construing
illas
promite
as
now
promise
those
men
but
now
he
suddenly
felt
at
a
disadvantage
because
he
knew
less
than
some
one
else
knew
there
must
be
a
world
of
things
connected
with
that
swedish
bark
which
if
he
only
knew
them
might
have
helped
him
to
get
on
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
make
a
figure
with
a
spirited
horse
and
a
new
saddle
two
hours
ago
as
tom
was
walking
to
ogg
he
saw
the
distant
future
before
him
as
he
might
have
seen
a
tempting
stretch
of
smooth
sandy
beach
beyond
a
belt
of
flinty
shingles
he
was
on
the
grassy
bank
then
and
thought
the
shingles
might
soon
be
passed
but
now
his
feet
were
on
the
sharp
stones
the
belt
of
shingles
had
widened
and
the
stretch
of
sand
had
dwindled
into
narrowness
what
did
my
uncle
deane
say
tom
said
maggie
putting
her
arm
through
tom
as
he
was
warming
himself
rather
drearily
by
the
kitchen
fire
did
he
say
he
would
give
you
a
situation
no
he
did
say
that
he
did
quite
promise
me
anything
he
seemed
to
think
i
could
have
a
very
good
situation
i
too
young
but
did
he
speak
kindly
tom
kindly
pooh
what
the
use
of
talking
about
that
i
would
care
about
his
speaking
kindly
if
i
could
get
a
situation
but
it
such
a
nuisance
and
bother
i
been
at
school
all
this
while
learning
latin
and
things
not
a
bit
of
good
to
me
and
now
my
uncle
says
i
must
set
about
learning
and
calculation
and
those
things
he
seems
to
make
out
i
good
for
nothing
tom
mouth
twitched
with
a
bitter
expression
as
he
looked
at
the
fire
oh
what
a
pity
we
have
got
dominie
sampson
said
maggie
who
could
help
mingling
some
gayety
with
their
sadness
if
he
had
taught
me
by
double
entry
and
after
the
italian
method
as
he
did
lucy
bertram
i
could
teach
you
tom
teach
yes
i
dare
say
that
always
the
tone
you
take
said
tom
dear
tom
i
was
only
joking
said
maggie
putting
her
cheek
against
his
but
it
always
the
same
maggie
said
tom
with
the
little
frown
he
put
on
when
he
was
about
to
be
justifiably
severe
you
always
setting
yourself
up
above
me
and
every
one
else
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
several
times
you
ought
not
to
have
spoken
as
you
did
to
my
uncles
and
aunts
you
should
leave
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
my
mother
and
you
and
not
put
yourself
forward
you
think
you
know
better
than
any
one
but
you
almost
always
wrong
i
can
judge
much
better
than
you
can
poor
tom
he
had
just
come
from
being
lectured
and
made
to
feel
his
inferiority
the
reaction
of
his
strong
nature
must
take
place
somehow
and
here
was
a
case
in
which
he
could
justly
show
himself
dominant
maggie
cheek
flushed
and
her
lip
quivered
with
conflicting
resentment
and
affection
and
a
certain
awe
as
well
as
admiration
of
tom
firmer
and
more
effective
character
she
did
not
answer
immediately
very
angry
words
rose
to
her
lips
but
they
were
driven
back
again
and
she
said
at
last
you
often
think
i
conceited
tom
when
i
do
mean
what
i
say
at
all
in
that
way
i
do
mean
to
put
myself
above
you
i
know
you
behaved
better
than
i
did
yesterday
but
you
are
always
so
harsh
to
me
tom
with
the
last
words
the
resentment
was
rising
again
no
i
not
harsh
said
tom
with
severe
decision
i
always
kind
to
you
and
so
i
shall
be
i
shall
always
take
care
of
you
but
you
must
mind
what
i
say
their
mother
came
in
now
and
maggie
rushed
away
that
her
burst
of
tears
which
she
felt
must
come
might
not
happen
till
she
was
safe
upstairs
they
were
very
bitter
tears
everybody
in
the
world
seemed
so
hard
and
unkind
to
maggie
there
was
no
indulgence
no
fondness
such
as
she
imagined
when
she
fashioned
the
world
afresh
in
her
own
thoughts
in
books
there
were
people
who
were
always
agreeable
or
tender
and
delighted
to
do
things
that
made
one
happy
and
who
did
not
show
their
kindness
by
finding
fault
the
world
outside
the
books
was
not
a
happy
one
maggie
felt
it
seemed
to
be
a
world
where
people
behaved
the
best
to
those
they
did
not
pretend
to
love
and
that
did
not
belong
to
them
and
if
life
had
no
love
in
it
what
else
was
there
for
maggie
nothing
but
poverty
and
the
companionship
of
her
narrow
griefs
perhaps
of
her
father
childish
dependence
there
is
no
hopelessness
so
sad
as
that
of
early
youth
when
the
soul
is
made
up
of
wants
and
has
no
long
memories
no
superadded
life
in
the
life
of
others
though
we
who
looked
on
think
lightly
of
such
premature
despair
as
if
our
vision
of
the
future
lightened
the
blind
sufferer
present
maggie
in
her
brown
frock
with
her
eyes
reddened
and
her
heavy
hair
pushed
back
looking
from
the
bed
where
her
father
lay
to
the
dull
walls
of
this
sad
chamber
which
was
the
centre
of
her
world
was
a
creature
full
of
eager
passionate
longings
for
all
that
was
beautiful
and
glad
thirsty
for
all
knowledge
with
an
ear
straining
after
dreamy
music
that
died
away
and
would
not
come
near
to
her
with
a
blind
unconscious
yearning
for
something
that
would
link
together
the
wonderful
impressions
of
this
mysterious
life
and
give
her
soul
a
sense
of
home
in
it
no
wonder
when
there
is
this
contrast
between
the
outward
and
the
inward
that
painful
collisions
come
of
it
chapter
vi
tending
to
refute
the
popular
prejudice
against
the
present
of
a
in
that
dark
time
of
december
the
sale
of
the
household
furniture
lasted
beyond
the
middle
of
the
second
day
tulliver
who
had
begun
in
his
intervals
of
consciousness
to
manifest
an
irritability
which
often
appeared
to
have
as
a
direct
effect
the
recurrence
of
spasmodic
rigidity
and
insensibility
had
lain
in
this
living
death
throughout
the
critical
hours
when
the
noise
of
the
sale
came
nearest
to
his
chamber
turnbull
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
less
risk
to
let
him
remain
where
he
was
than
to
remove
him
to
cottage
a
plan
which
the
good
luke
had
proposed
to
tulliver
thinking
it
would
be
very
bad
if
the
master
were
to
waken
up
at
the
noise
of
the
sale
and
the
wife
and
children
had
sat
imprisoned
in
the
silent
chamber
watching
the
large
prostrate
figure
on
the
bed
and
trembling
lest
the
blank
face
should
suddenly
show
some
response
to
the
sounds
which
fell
on
their
own
ears
with
such
obstinate
painful
repetition
but
it
was
over
at
last
that
time
of
importunate
certainty
and
suspense
the
sharp
sound
of
a
voice
almost
as
metallic
as
the
rap
that
followed
it
had
ceased
the
tramping
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
had
died
out
tulliver
blond
face
seemed
aged
ten
years
by
the
last
thirty
hours
the
poor
woman
mind
had
been
busy
divining
when
her
favorite
things
were
being
knocked
down
by
the
terrible
hammer
her
heart
had
been
fluttering
at
the
thought
that
first
one
thing
and
then
another
had
gone
to
be
identified
as
hers
in
the
hateful
publicity
of
the
golden
lion
and
all
the
while
she
had
to
sit
and
make
no
sign
of
this
inward
agitation
such
things
bring
lines
in
faces
and
broaden
the
streaks
of
white
among
the
hairs
that
once
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dipped
in
pure
sunshine
already
at
three
kezia
the
housemaid
who
regarded
all
people
that
came
to
the
sale
as
her
personal
enemies
the
dirt
on
whose
feet
was
of
a
peculiarly
vile
quality
had
begun
to
scrub
and
swill
with
an
energy
much
assisted
by
a
continual
low
muttering
against
folks
as
came
to
buy
up
other
folk
things
and
made
light
of
scrazing
the
tops
of
mahogany
tables
over
which
better
folks
than
themselves
had
had
to
suffer
a
waste
of
tissue
through
evaporation
she
was
not
scrubbing
indiscriminately
for
there
would
be
further
dirt
of
the
same
atrocious
kind
made
by
people
who
had
still
to
fetch
away
their
purchases
but
she
was
bent
on
bringing
the
parlor
where
that
pig
the
bailiff
had
sat
to
such
an
appearance
of
scant
comfort
as
could
be
given
to
it
by
cleanliness
and
the
few
articles
of
furniture
bought
in
for
the
family
her
mistress
and
the
young
folks
should
have
their
tea
in
it
that
night
kezia
was
determined
it
was
between
five
and
six
near
the
usual
teatime
when
she
came
upstairs
and
said
that
master
tom
was
wanted
the
person
who
wanted
him
was
in
the
kitchen
and
in
the
first
moments
by
the
imperfect
fire
and
candle
light
tom
had
not
even
an
indefinite
sense
of
any
acquaintance
with
the
rather
but
active
figure
perhaps
two
years
older
than
himself
that
looked
at
him
with
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
set
in
a
disc
of
freckles
and
pulled
some
curly
red
locks
with
a
strong
intention
of
respect
a
hat
and
a
certain
shiny
deposit
of
dirt
on
the
rest
of
the
costume
as
of
tablets
prepared
for
writing
upon
suggested
a
calling
that
had
to
do
with
boats
but
this
did
not
help
tom
memory
sarvant
master
tom
said
he
of
the
red
locks
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
break
through
a
air
of
melancholy
you
know
me
again
i
doubt
he
went
on
as
tom
continued
to
look
at
him
inquiringly
but
i
like
to
talk
to
you
by
yourself
a
bit
please
there
a
fire
i
the
parlor
master
tom
said
kezia
who
objected
to
leaving
the
kitchen
in
the
crisis
of
toasting
come
this
way
then
said
tom
wondering
if
this
young
fellow
belonged
to
guest
wharf
for
his
imagination
ran
continually
toward
that
particular
spot
and
uncle
deane
might
any
time
be
sending
for
him
to
say
that
there
was
a
situation
at
liberty
the
bright
fire
in
the
parlor
was
the
only
light
that
showed
the
few
chairs
the
bureau
the
carpetless
floor
and
the
one
table
no
not
the
table
there
was
a
second
table
in
a
corner
with
a
large
bible
and
a
few
other
books
upon
it
it
was
this
new
strange
bareness
that
tom
felt
first
before
he
thought
of
looking
again
at
the
face
which
was
also
lit
up
by
the
fire
and
which
stole
a
questioning
glance
at
him
as
the
entirely
strange
voice
said
why
you
do
remember
bob
then
as
you
gen
the
to
mr
tom
the
was
taken
out
in
the
same
moment
and
the
largest
blade
opened
by
way
of
irresistible
demonstration
what
bob
jakin
said
tom
not
with
any
cordial
delight
for
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
that
early
intimacy
symbolized
by
the
and
was
not
at
all
sure
that
bob
motives
for
recalling
it
were
entirely
admirable
ay
ay
bob
jakin
if
jakin
it
must
be
there
so
many
bobs
as
you
went
arter
the
squerrils
with
that
day
as
i
plumped
right
down
from
the
bough
and
bruised
my
shins
a
good
un
but
i
got
the
squerril
tight
for
all
that
an
a
scratter
it
was
an
this
littlish
broke
you
see
but
i
would
hev
a
new
un
put
in
they
might
be
cheatin
me
an
givin
me
another
knife
instid
for
there
such
a
blade
i
the
country
it
got
used
to
my
hand
like
there
was
niver
nobody
else
gen
me
nothin
but
what
i
got
by
my
own
sharpness
only
you
tom
if
it
was
bill
fawks
as
gen
me
the
terrier
pup
istid
o
drowndi
it
an
i
had
to
jaw
him
a
good
un
afore
he
give
it
me
bob
spoke
with
a
sharp
and
rather
treble
volubility
and
got
through
his
long
speech
with
surprising
despatch
giving
the
blade
of
his
knife
an
affectionate
rub
on
his
sleeve
when
he
had
finished
well
bob
said
tom
with
a
slight
air
of
patronage
the
foregoing
reminscences
having
disposed
him
to
be
as
friendly
as
was
becoming
though
there
was
no
part
of
his
acquaintance
with
bob
that
he
remembered
better
than
the
cause
of
their
parting
quarrel
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
why
no
tom
answered
bob
shutting
up
his
knife
with
a
click
and
returning
it
to
his
pocket
where
he
seemed
to
be
feeling
for
something
else
i
should
ha
come
back
upon
you
now
ye
trouble
an
folks
say
as
the
master
as
i
used
to
frighten
the
birds
for
an
he
flogged
me
a
bit
for
fun
when
he
catched
me
eatin
the
turnip
as
they
say
he
niver
lift
up
his
head
no
more
i
ha
come
now
to
ax
you
to
gi
me
another
knife
you
gen
me
one
afore
if
a
chap
gives
me
one
black
eye
that
enough
for
me
i
ax
him
for
another
afore
i
sarve
him
out
an
a
good
worth
as
much
as
a
bad
un
anyhow
i
shall
niver
grow
again
tom
an
you
war
the
little
chap
as
i
liked
the
best
when
war
a
little
chap
for
all
you
leathered
me
and
would
look
at
me
again
there
dick
brumby
there
i
could
leather
him
as
much
as
a
mind
but
lors
you
get
tired
o
leatherin
a
chap
when
you
can
niver
make
him
see
what
you
want
him
to
shy
at
seen
chaps
as
stand
starin
at
a
bough
till
their
eyes
shot
out
afore
they
see
as
a
bird
tail
war
a
leaf
it
poor
work
goin
wi
such
raff
but
you
war
allays
a
rare
un
at
shying
tom
an
i
could
trusten
to
you
for
droppin
down
wi
your
stick
in
the
nick
o
time
at
a
rat
or
a
stoat
or
that
when
i
war
the
bushes
bob
had
drawn
out
a
dirty
canvas
bag
and
would
perhaps
not
have
paused
just
then
if
maggie
had
not
entered
the
room
and
darted
a
look
of
surprise
and
curiosity
at
him
whereupon
he
pulled
his
red
locks
again
with
due
respect
but
the
next
moment
the
sense
of
the
altered
room
came
upon
maggie
with
a
force
that
overpowered
the
thought
of
bob
presence
her
eyes
had
immediately
glanced
from
him
to
the
place
where
the
bookcase
had
hung
there
was
nothing
now
but
the
oblong
unfaded
space
on
the
wall
and
below
it
the
small
table
with
the
bible
and
the
few
other
books
oh
tom
she
burst
out
clasping
her
hands
where
are
the
books
i
thought
my
uncle
glegg
said
he
would
buy
them
did
he
are
those
all
they
left
us
i
suppose
so
said
tom
with
a
sort
of
desperate
indifference
why
should
they
buy
many
books
when
they
bought
so
little
furniture
oh
but
tom
said
maggie
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
she
rushed
up
to
the
table
to
see
what
books
had
been
rescued
our
dear
old
pilgrim
progress
that
you
colored
with
your
little
paints
and
that
picture
of
pilgrim
with
a
mantle
on
looking
just
like
a
turtle
oh
dear
maggie
went
on
half
sobbing
as
she
turned
over
the
few
books
i
thought
we
should
never
part
with
that
while
we
lived
everything
is
going
away
from
us
the
end
of
our
lives
will
have
nothing
in
it
like
the
beginning
maggie
turned
away
from
the
table
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
with
the
big
tears
ready
to
roll
down
her
cheeks
quite
blinded
to
the
presence
of
bob
who
was
looking
at
her
with
the
pursuant
gaze
of
an
intelligent
dumb
animal
with
perceptions
more
perfect
than
his
comprehension
well
bob
said
tom
feeling
that
the
subject
of
the
books
was
unseasonable
i
suppose
you
just
came
to
see
me
because
we
in
trouble
that
was
very
of
you
i
tell
you
how
it
is
master
tom
said
bob
beginning
to
untwist
his
canvas
bag
you
see
been
with
a
barge
this
two
how
been
gettin
my
livin
if
it
was
when
i
was
tentin
the
furnace
between
whiles
at
torry
mill
but
a
ago
i
a
rare
bit
o
luck
i
allays
thought
i
was
a
lucky
chap
for
i
niver
set
a
trap
but
what
i
catched
something
but
this
was
trap
it
was
a
fire
i
torry
mill
an
i
doused
it
else
it
set
th
oil
alight
an
the
genelman
gen
me
ten
suvreigns
he
gen
me
himself
last
week
an
he
said
first
i
was
a
sperrited
chap
but
i
knowed
that
afore
but
then
he
outs
wi
the
ten
suvreigns
an
that
war
summat
new
here
they
are
all
but
one
here
bob
emptied
the
canvas
bag
on
the
table
an
when
i
got
my
head
was
all
of
a
boil
like
a
kettle
o
broth
thinkin
what
sort
o
life
i
should
take
to
for
there
war
a
many
trades
i
thought
on
for
as
for
the
barge
clean
tired
out
for
it
pulls
the
days
out
till
they
as
long
as
pigs
chitterlings
an
i
thought
first
i
ha
ferrets
an
dogs
an
be
a
an
then
i
thought
as
i
should
like
a
bigger
way
o
life
as
i
did
know
so
well
for
seen
to
the
bottom
an
i
thought
an
thought
till
at
last
i
settled
be
a
packman
for
they
knowin
fellers
the
packmen
are
an
carry
the
lightest
things
i
could
i
my
pack
an
there
be
a
use
for
a
feller
tongue
as
is
no
use
neither
wi
rats
nor
barges
an
i
should
go
about
the
country
far
an
wide
an
come
round
the
women
my
tongue
an
get
my
dinner
hot
at
the
public
lors
it
be
a
lovely
life
bob
paused
and
then
said
with
defiant
decision
as
if
resolutely
turning
his
back
on
that
paradisaic
picture
but
i
do
mind
about
it
not
a
chip
an
changed
one
o
the
suvreigns
to
buy
my
mother
a
goose
for
dinner
an
bought
a
blue
plush
wescoat
an
a
sealskin
cap
for
if
i
meant
to
be
a
packman
i
do
it
respectable
but
i
do
mind
about
it
not
a
chip
my
yead
is
a
turnip
an
i
shall
have
a
chance
o
dousing
another
fire
afore
long
i
a
lucky
chap
so
i
thank
you
to
take
the
nine
suvreigns
tom
and
set
yoursen
up
with
somehow
if
it
true
as
the
master
broke
they
may
go
fur
enough
but
they
help
tom
was
touched
keenly
enough
to
forget
his
pride
and
suspicion
you
a
very
kind
fellow
bob
he
said
coloring
with
that
little
diffident
tremor
in
his
voice
which
gave
a
certain
charm
even
to
pride
and
severity
and
i
forget
you
again
though
i
know
you
this
evening
but
i
ca
take
the
nine
sovereigns
i
should
be
taking
your
little
fortune
from
you
and
they
would
do
me
much
good
either
would
they
mr
tom
said
bob
regretfully
now
do
say
so
you
think
i
want
i
are
a
poor
chap
my
mother
gets
a
good
wi
picking
feathers
an
things
an
if
she
eats
nothin
but
it
runs
to
fat
an
i
such
a
lucky
chap
an
i
doubt
you
are
quite
so
lucky
tom
th
old
master
is
anyhow
an
so
you
might
take
a
slice
o
my
luck
an
no
harm
done
lors
i
found
a
leg
o
pork
i
the
river
one
day
it
had
tumbled
out
o
one
o
them
dutchmen
i
be
bound
come
think
better
on
it
tom
for
old
sake
else
i
shall
think
you
bear
me
a
grudge
bob
pushed
the
sovereigns
forward
but
before
tom
could
speak
maggie
clasping
her
hands
and
looking
penitently
at
bob
said
oh
i
so
sorry
bob
i
never
thought
you
were
so
good
why
i
think
you
the
kindest
person
in
the
world
bob
had
not
been
aware
of
the
injurious
opinion
for
which
maggie
was
performing
an
inward
act
of
penitence
but
he
smiled
with
pleasure
at
this
handsome
eulogy
especially
from
a
young
lass
who
as
he
informed
his
mother
that
evening
had
such
uncommon
eyes
they
looked
somehow
as
they
made
him
feel
nohow
no
indeed
bob
i
ca
take
them
said
tom
but
do
think
i
feel
your
kindness
less
because
i
say
no
i
do
want
to
take
anything
from
anybody
but
to
work
my
own
way
and
those
sovereigns
help
me
much
they
would
really
if
i
were
to
take
them
let
me
shake
hands
with
you
instead
tom
put
out
his
pink
palm
and
bob
was
not
slow
to
place
his
hard
grimy
hand
within
it
let
me
put
the
sovereigns
in
the
bag
again
said
maggie
and
come
and
see
us
when
you
bought
your
pack
bob
it
like
as
if
i
come
out
o
make
believe
o
purpose
to
show
you
said
bob
with
an
air
of
discontent
as
maggie
gave
him
the
bag
again
back
i
this
way
i
a
bit
of
a
do
you
know
but
it
is
that
sort
o
do
it
when
a
feller
a
big
rogue
or
a
big
flat
i
like
to
let
him
in
a
bit
that
all
now
do
you
be
up
to
any
tricks
bob
said
tom
else
you
get
transported
some
day
no
no
not
me
tom
said
bob
with
an
air
of
cheerful
confidence
there
no
law
again
if
i
was
to
take
a
fool
in
now
and
then
he
niver
get
any
wiser
but
lors
hev
a
suvreign
to
buy
you
and
miss
summat
for
a
token
just
to
match
my
while
bob
was
speaking
he
laid
down
the
sovereign
and
resolutely
twisted
up
his
bag
again
tom
pushed
back
the
gold
and
said
no
indeed
bob
thank
you
heartily
but
i
ca
take
it
and
maggie
taking
it
between
her
fingers
held
it
up
to
bob
and
said
more
persuasively
not
now
but
perhaps
another
time
if
ever
tom
or
my
father
wants
help
that
you
can
give
we
let
you
know
wo
we
tom
that
what
you
would
like
to
have
us
always
depend
on
you
as
a
friend
that
we
can
go
to
is
it
bob
yes
miss
and
thank
you
said
bob
reluctantly
taking
the
money
that
what
i
like
anything
as
you
like
an
i
wish
you
miss
and
tom
and
thank
you
for
shaking
hands
wi
me
you
would
take
the
money
kezia
entrance
with
very
black
looks
to
inquire
if
she
bring
in
the
tea
now
or
whether
the
toast
was
to
get
hardened
to
a
brick
was
a
seasonable
check
on
bob
flux
of
words
and
hastened
his
parting
bow
chapter
vii
how
a
hen
takes
to
stratagem
the
days
passed
and
tulliver
showed
at
least
to
the
eyes
of
the
medical
man
stronger
and
stronger
symptoms
of
a
gradual
return
to
his
normal
condition
the
paralytic
obstruction
was
little
by
little
losing
its
tenacity
and
the
mind
was
rising
from
under
it
with
fitful
struggles
like
a
living
creature
making
its
way
from
under
a
great
snowdrift
that
slides
and
slides
again
and
shuts
up
the
newly
made
opening
time
would
have
seemed
to
creep
to
the
watchers
by
the
bed
if
it
had
only
been
measured
by
the
doubtful
distant
hope
which
kept
count
of
the
moments
within
the
chamber
but
it
was
measured
for
them
by
a
dread
which
made
the
nights
come
too
quickly
while
tulliver
was
slowly
becoming
himself
again
his
lot
was
hastening
toward
its
moment
of
most
palpable
change
the
had
done
their
work
like
any
respectable
gunsmith
conscientiously
preparing
the
musket
that
duly
pointed
by
a
brave
arm
will
spoil
a
life
or
two
allocaturs
filing
of
bills
in
chancery
decrees
of
sale
are
legal
or
that
can
never
hit
a
solitary
mark
but
must
fall
with
widespread
shattering
so
deeply
inherent
is
it
in
this
life
of
ours
that
men
have
to
suffer
for
each
other
sins
so
inevitably
diffusive
is
human
suffering
that
even
justice
makes
its
victims
and
we
can
conceive
no
retribution
that
does
not
spread
beyond
its
mark
in
pulsations
of
unmerited
pain
by
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
in
january
the
bills
were
out
advertising
the
sale
under
a
decree
of
chancery
of
farming
and
other
stock
to
be
followed
by
a
sale
of
the
mill
and
land
held
in
the
proper
hour
at
the
golden
lion
the
miller
himself
unaware
of
the
lapse
of
time
fancied
himself
still
in
that
first
stage
of
his
misfortunes
when
expedients
might
be
thought
of
and
often
in
his
conscious
hours
talked
in
a
feeble
disjointed
manner
of
plans
he
would
carry
out
when
he
got
well
the
wife
and
children
were
not
without
hope
of
an
issue
that
would
at
least
save
tulliver
from
leaving
the
old
spot
and
seeking
an
entirely
strange
life
for
uncle
deane
had
been
induced
to
interest
himself
in
this
stage
of
the
business
it
would
not
he
acknowledged
be
a
bad
speculation
for
guest
to
buy
dorlcote
mill
and
carry
on
the
business
which
was
a
good
one
and
might
be
increased
by
the
addition
of
steam
power
in
which
case
tulliver
might
be
retained
as
manager
still
deane
would
say
nothing
decided
about
the
matter
the
fact
that
wakem
held
the
mortgage
on
the
land
might
put
it
into
his
head
to
bid
for
the
whole
estate
and
further
to
outbid
the
cautious
firm
of
guest
who
did
not
carry
on
business
on
sentimental
grounds
deane
was
obliged
to
tell
tulliver
something
to
that
effect
when
he
rode
over
to
the
mill
to
inspect
the
books
in
company
with
glegg
for
she
had
observed
that
if
guest
would
only
think
about
it
tulliver
father
and
grandfather
had
been
carrying
on
dorlcote
mill
long
before
the
of
that
firm
had
been
so
much
as
thought
of
deane
in
reply
doubted
whether
that
was
precisely
the
relation
between
the
two
mills
which
would
determine
their
value
as
investments
as
for
uncle
glegg
the
thing
lay
quite
beyond
his
imagination
the
man
felt
sincere
pity
for
the
tulliver
family
but
his
money
was
all
locked
up
in
excellent
mortgages
and
he
could
run
no
risk
that
would
be
unfair
to
his
own
relatives
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
tulliver
should
have
some
new
flannel
waistcoats
which
he
had
himself
renounced
in
favor
of
a
more
elastic
commodity
and
that
he
would
buy
tulliver
a
pound
of
tea
now
and
then
it
would
be
a
journey
which
his
benevolence
delighted
in
beforehand
to
carry
the
tea
and
see
her
pleasure
on
being
assured
it
was
the
best
black
still
it
was
clear
that
deane
was
kindly
disposed
toward
the
tullivers
one
day
he
had
brought
lucy
who
was
come
home
for
the
christmas
holidays
and
the
little
blond
had
pressed
itself
against
maggie
darker
cheek
with
many
kisses
and
some
tears
these
fair
slim
daughters
keep
up
a
tender
spot
in
the
heart
of
many
a
respectable
partner
in
a
respectable
firm
and
perhaps
lucy
anxious
pitying
questions
about
her
poor
cousins
helped
to
make
uncle
deane
more
prompt
in
finding
tom
a
temporary
place
in
the
warehouse
and
in
putting
him
in
the
way
of
getting
evening
lessons
in
and
calculation
that
might
have
cheered
the
lad
and
fed
his
hopes
a
little
if
there
had
not
come
at
the
same
time
the
blow
of
finding
that
his
father
must
be
a
bankrupt
after
all
at
least
the
creditors
must
be
asked
to
take
less
than
their
due
which
to
tom
untechnical
mind
was
the
same
thing
as
bankruptcy
his
father
must
not
only
be
said
to
have
lost
his
property
but
to
have
failed
the
word
that
carried
the
worst
obloquy
to
tom
mind
for
when
the
defendant
claim
for
costs
had
been
satisfied
there
would
remain
the
friendly
bill
of
gore
and
the
deficiency
at
the
bank
as
well
as
the
other
debts
which
would
make
the
assets
shrink
into
unequivocal
disproportion
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
shillings
in
the
pound
predicted
deane
in
a
decided
tone
tightening
his
lips
and
the
words
fell
on
tom
like
a
scalding
liquied
leaving
a
continual
smart
he
was
sadly
in
want
of
something
to
keep
up
his
spirits
a
little
in
the
unpleasant
newness
of
his
position
suddenly
transported
from
the
easy
carpeted
of
at
stelling
and
the
busy
idleness
of
in
a
last
half
at
school
to
the
companionship
of
sacks
and
hides
and
bawling
men
thundering
down
heavy
weights
at
his
elbow
the
first
step
toward
getting
on
in
the
world
was
a
chill
dusty
noisy
affair
and
implied
going
without
one
tea
in
order
to
stay
in
ogg
and
have
an
evening
lesson
from
a
elderly
clerk
in
a
room
smelling
strongly
of
bad
tobacco
tom
young
face
had
its
colors
very
much
deadened
by
the
time
he
took
off
his
hat
at
home
and
sat
down
with
keen
hunger
to
his
supper
no
wonder
he
was
a
little
cross
if
his
mother
or
maggie
spoke
to
him
but
all
this
while
tulliver
was
brooding
over
a
scheme
by
which
she
and
no
one
else
would
avert
the
result
most
to
be
dreaded
and
prevent
wakem
from
entertaining
the
purpose
of
bidding
for
the
mill
imagine
a
truly
respectable
and
amiable
hen
by
some
portentous
anomaly
taking
to
reflection
and
inventing
combinations
by
which
she
might
prevail
on
hodge
not
to
wring
her
neck
or
send
her
and
her
chicks
to
market
the
result
could
hardly
be
other
than
much
cackling
and
fluttering
tulliver
seeing
that
everything
had
gone
wrong
had
begun
to
think
she
had
been
too
passive
in
life
and
that
if
she
had
applied
her
mind
to
business
and
taken
a
strong
resolution
now
and
then
it
would
have
been
all
the
better
for
her
and
her
family
nobody
it
appeared
had
thought
of
going
to
speak
to
wakem
on
this
business
of
the
mill
and
yet
tulliver
reflected
it
would
have
been
quite
the
shortest
method
of
securing
the
right
end
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
be
sure
for
tulliver
to
go
even
if
he
had
been
able
and
willing
for
he
had
been
going
to
law
against
wakem
and
abusing
him
for
the
last
ten
years
wakem
was
always
likely
to
have
a
spite
against
him
and
now
that
tulliver
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
her
husband
was
very
much
in
the
wrong
to
bring
her
into
this
trouble
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
his
opinion
of
wakem
was
wrong
too
to
be
sure
wakem
had
put
the
bailies
in
the
house
and
sold
them
up
but
she
supposed
he
did
that
to
please
the
man
that
lent
tulliver
the
money
for
a
lawyer
had
more
folks
to
please
than
one
and
he
was
likely
to
put
tulliver
who
had
gone
to
law
with
him
above
everybody
else
in
the
world
the
attorney
might
be
a
very
reasonable
man
why
not
he
had
married
a
miss
clint
and
at
the
time
tulliver
had
heard
of
that
marriage
the
summer
when
she
wore
her
blue
satin
spencer
and
had
not
yet
any
thoughts
of
tulliver
she
knew
no
harm
of
wakem
and
certainly
toward
herself
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
miss
dodson
it
was
out
of
all
possibility
that
he
could
entertain
anything
but
when
it
was
once
brought
home
to
his
observation
that
she
for
her
part
had
never
wanted
to
go
to
law
and
indeed
was
at
present
disposed
to
take
wakem
view
of
all
subjects
rather
than
her
husband
in
fact
if
that
attorney
saw
a
respectable
matron
like
herself
disposed
to
give
him
good
words
why
should
he
listen
to
her
representations
for
she
would
put
the
matter
clearly
before
him
which
had
never
been
done
yet
and
he
would
never
go
and
bid
for
the
mill
on
purpose
to
spite
her
an
innocent
woman
who
thought
it
likely
enough
that
she
had
danced
with
him
in
their
youth
at
squire
darleigh
for
at
those
big
dances
she
had
often
and
often
danced
with
young
men
whose
names
she
had
forgotten
tulliver
hid
these
reasonings
in
her
own
bosom
for
when
she
had
thrown
out
a
hint
to
deane
and
glegg
that
she
would
mind
going
to
speak
to
wakem
herself
they
had
said
no
no
no
and
pooh
pooh
and
let
wakem
alone
in
the
tone
of
men
who
were
not
likely
to
give
a
candid
attention
to
a
more
definite
exposition
of
her
project
still
less
dared
she
mention
the
plan
to
tom
and
maggie
for
the
children
were
always
so
against
everything
their
mother
said
and
tom
she
observed
was
almost
as
much
set
against
wakem
as
his
father
was
but
this
unusual
concentration
of
thought
naturally
gave
tulliver
an
unusual
power
of
device
and
determination
and
a
day
or
two
before
the
sale
to
be
held
at
the
golden
lion
when
there
was
no
longer
any
time
to
be
lost
she
carried
out
her
plan
by
a
stratagem
there
were
pickles
in
question
a
large
stock
of
pickles
and
ketchup
which
tulliver
possessed
and
which
hyndmarsh
the
grocer
would
certainly
purchase
if
she
could
transact
the
business
in
a
personal
interview
so
she
would
walk
with
tom
to
ogg
that
morning
and
when
tom
urged
that
she
might
let
the
pickles
be
at
present
he
did
like
her
to
go
about
just
yet
she
appeared
so
hurt
at
this
conduct
in
her
son
contradicting
her
about
pickles
which
she
had
made
after
the
family
receipts
inherited
from
his
own
grandmother
who
had
died
when
his
mother
was
a
little
girl
that
he
gave
way
and
they
walked
together
until
she
turned
toward
danish
street
where
hyndmarsh
retailed
his
grocery
not
far
from
the
offices
of
wakem
that
gentleman
was
not
yet
come
to
his
office
would
tulliver
sit
down
by
the
fire
in
his
private
room
and
wait
for
him
she
had
not
long
to
wait
before
the
punctual
attorney
entered
knitting
his
brow
with
an
examining
glance
at
the
stout
blond
woman
who
rose
curtsying
deferentially
a
tallish
man
with
an
aquiline
nose
and
abundant
hair
you
have
never
seen
wakem
before
and
are
possibly
wondering
whether
he
was
really
as
eminent
a
rascal
and
as
crafty
bitter
an
enemy
of
honest
humanity
in
general
and
of
tulliver
in
particular
as
he
is
represented
to
be
in
that
eidolon
or
portrait
of
him
which
we
have
seen
to
exist
in
the
miller
mind
it
is
clear
that
the
irascible
miller
was
a
man
to
interpret
any
that
grazed
him
as
an
attempt
on
his
own
life
and
was
liable
to
entanglements
in
this
puzzling
world
which
due
consideration
had
to
his
own
infallibility
required
the
hypothesis
of
a
very
active
diabolical
agency
to
explain
them
it
is
still
possible
to
believe
that
the
attorney
was
not
more
guilty
toward
him
than
an
ingenious
machine
which
performs
its
work
with
much
regularity
is
guilty
toward
the
rash
man
who
venturing
too
near
it
is
caught
up
by
some
or
other
and
suddenly
converted
into
unexpected
but
it
is
really
impossible
to
decide
this
question
by
a
glance
at
his
person
the
lines
and
lights
of
the
human
countenance
are
like
other
symbols
not
always
easy
to
read
without
a
key
on
an
view
of
wakem
aquiline
nose
which
offended
tulliver
there
was
not
more
rascality
than
in
the
shape
of
his
stiff
though
this
too
along
with
his
nose
might
have
become
fraught
with
damnatory
meaning
when
once
the
rascality
was
ascertained
tulliver
i
think
said
wakem
yes
sir
miss
elizabeth
dodson
as
was
pray
be
seated
you
have
some
business
with
me
well
sir
yes
said
tulliver
beginning
to
feel
alarmed
at
her
own
courage
now
she
was
really
in
presence
of
the
formidable
man
and
reflecting
that
she
had
not
settled
with
herself
how
she
should
begin
wakem
felt
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
i
hope
sir
she
began
at
last
i
hope
sir
you
not
as
bear
you
any
because
o
my
husband
losing
his
lawsuit
and
the
bailies
being
put
in
and
the
linen
being
sold
oh
dear
for
i
was
brought
up
in
that
way
i
sure
you
remember
my
father
sir
for
he
was
close
friends
with
squire
darleigh
and
we
allays
went
to
the
dances
there
the
miss
dodsons
nobody
could
be
more
looked
on
and
justly
for
there
was
four
of
us
and
quite
aware
as
glegg
and
deane
are
my
sisters
and
as
for
going
to
law
and
losing
money
and
having
sales
before
you
dead
i
never
saw
anything
o
that
before
i
was
married
nor
for
a
long
while
after
and
i
not
to
be
answerable
for
my
bad
luck
i
marrying
out
my
own
family
into
one
where
the
was
different
and
as
for
being
drawn
in
t
abuse
you
as
other
folks
abuse
you
sir
i
niver
was
and
nobody
can
say
it
of
me
tulliver
shook
her
head
a
little
and
looked
at
the
hem
of
her
i
no
doubt
of
what
you
say
tulliver
said
wakem
with
cold
politeness
but
you
have
some
question
to
ask
me
well
sir
yes
but
that
what
i
said
to
myself
i
said
had
some
feeling
and
as
for
my
husband
as
has
been
himself
for
this
two
months
i
not
him
in
no
way
for
being
so
hot
about
th
erigation
not
but
what
there
worse
men
for
he
never
wronged
nobody
of
a
shilling
nor
a
penny
not
willingly
and
as
for
his
fieriness
and
lawing
what
could
i
do
and
him
struck
as
if
it
was
with
death
when
he
got
the
letter
as
said
you
the
hold
the
land
but
i
ca
believe
but
what
you
behave
as
a
gentleman
what
does
all
this
mean
mrs
tulliver
said
wakem
rather
sharply
what
do
you
want
to
ask
me
why
sir
if
you
be
so
good
said
tulliver
starting
a
little
and
speaking
more
hurriedly
if
you
be
so
good
not
to
buy
the
mill
an
the
land
the
land
would
so
much
matter
only
my
husband
ull
be
like
mad
at
your
having
it
something
like
a
new
thought
flashed
across
wakem
face
as
he
said
who
told
you
i
meant
to
buy
it
why
sir
it
none
o
my
inventing
and
i
should
never
ha
thought
of
it
for
my
husband
as
ought
to
know
about
the
law
he
allays
used
to
say
as
lawyers
had
never
no
call
to
buy
anything
either
lands
or
houses
for
they
allays
got
into
their
hands
other
ways
an
i
should
think
that
be
the
way
with
you
sir
and
i
niver
said
as
you
be
the
man
to
do
contrairy
to
that
ah
well
who
was
it
that
say
so
said
wakem
opening
his
desk
and
moving
things
about
with
the
accompaniment
of
an
almost
inaudible
whistle
why
sir
it
was
glegg
and
deane
as
have
all
the
management
and
deane
thinks
as
guest
buy
the
mill
and
let
tulliver
work
it
for
if
you
did
bid
for
it
and
raise
the
price
and
it
be
such
a
thing
for
my
husband
to
stay
where
he
is
if
he
could
get
his
living
for
it
was
his
father
before
him
the
mill
was
and
his
grandfather
built
it
though
i
was
fond
o
the
noise
of
it
when
first
i
was
married
for
there
was
no
mills
in
our
family
not
the
dodson
and
if
i
known
as
the
mills
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
law
it
would
have
been
me
as
have
been
the
first
dodson
to
marry
one
but
i
went
into
it
blindfold
that
i
did
erigation
and
everything
what
guest
would
keep
the
mill
in
their
own
hands
i
suppose
and
pay
your
husband
wages
oh
dear
sir
it
hard
to
think
of
said
poor
tulliver
a
little
tear
making
its
way
as
my
husband
should
take
wage
but
it
look
more
like
what
used
to
be
to
stay
at
the
mill
than
to
go
anywhere
else
and
if
you
only
think
if
you
was
to
bid
for
the
mill
and
buy
it
my
husband
might
be
struck
worse
than
he
was
before
and
niver
get
better
again
as
he
getting
now
well
but
if
i
bought
the
mill
and
allowed
your
husband
to
act
as
my
manager
in
the
same
way
how
then
said
wakem
oh
sir
i
doubt
he
could
niver
be
got
to
do
it
not
if
the
very
mill
stood
still
to
beg
and
pray
of
him
for
your
name
like
poison
to
him
it
so
as
never
was
and
he
looks
upon
it
as
you
been
the
ruin
of
him
all
along
ever
since
you
set
the
law
on
him
about
the
road
through
the
meadow
that
eight
year
ago
and
he
been
going
on
ever
since
as
i
allays
told
him
he
was
wrong
he
a
fool
burst
out
wakem
forgetting
himself
oh
dear
sir
said
tulliver
frightened
at
a
result
so
different
from
the
one
she
had
fixed
her
mind
on
i
would
wish
to
contradict
you
but
it
like
enough
he
changed
his
mind
with
this
illness
he
forgot
a
many
things
he
used
to
talk
about
and
you
would
like
to
have
a
corpse
on
your
mind
if
he
was
to
die
and
they
say
as
it
allays
unlucky
when
dorlcote
mill
changes
hands
and
the
water
might
all
run
away
and
not
as
i
wishing
you
any
sir
for
i
forgot
to
tell
you
as
i
remember
your
wedding
as
if
it
was
yesterday
wakem
was
a
miss
clint
i
know
and
my
boy
as
there
is
a
nicer
handsomer
straighter
boy
nowhere
went
to
school
with
your
son
wakem
rose
opened
the
door
and
called
to
one
of
his
clerks
you
must
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
tulliver
i
have
business
that
must
be
attended
to
and
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
necessary
to
be
said
but
if
you
bear
it
in
mind
sir
said
tulliver
rising
and
not
run
against
me
and
my
children
and
i
not
denying
tulliver
been
in
the
wrong
but
he
been
punished
enough
and
there
worse
men
for
it
been
giving
to
other
folks
has
been
his
fault
he
done
nobody
any
harm
but
himself
and
his
family
the
more
the
pity
and
i
go
and
look
at
the
bare
shelves
every
day
and
think
where
all
my
things
used
to
stand
yes
yes
i
bear
it
in
mind
said
wakem
hastily
looking
toward
the
open
door
and
if
you
please
not
to
say
as
i
been
to
speak
to
you
for
my
son
be
very
angry
with
me
for
demeaning
myself
i
know
he
would
and
i
trouble
enough
without
being
scolded
by
my
children
poor
tulliver
voice
trembled
a
little
and
she
could
make
no
answer
to
the
attorney
good
morning
but
curtsied
and
walked
out
in
silence
which
day
is
it
that
dorlcote
mill
is
to
be
sold
where
the
bill
said
wakem
to
his
clerk
when
they
were
alone
next
friday
is
the
day
friday
at
six
oh
just
run
to
winship
the
auctioneer
and
see
if
he
at
home
i
have
some
business
for
him
ask
him
to
come
up
although
when
wakem
entered
his
office
that
morning
he
had
had
no
intention
of
purchasing
dorlcote
mill
his
mind
was
already
made
up
tulliver
had
suggested
to
him
several
determining
motives
and
his
mental
glance
was
very
rapid
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
be
prompt
without
being
rash
because
their
motives
run
in
fixed
tracks
and
they
have
no
need
to
reconcile
conflicting
aims
to
suppose
that
wakem
had
the
same
sort
of
inveterate
hatred
toward
tulliver
that
tulliver
had
toward
him
would
be
like
supposing
that
a
pike
and
a
roach
can
look
at
each
other
from
a
similar
point
of
view
the
roach
necessarily
abhors
the
mode
in
which
the
pike
gets
his
living
and
the
pike
is
likely
to
think
nothing
further
even
of
the
most
indignant
roach
than
that
he
is
excellent
good
eating
it
could
only
be
when
the
roach
choked
him
that
the
pike
could
entertain
a
strong
personal
animosity
if
tulliver
had
ever
seriously
injured
or
thwarted
the
attorney
wakem
would
not
have
refused
him
the
distinction
of
being
a
special
object
of
his
vindictiveness
but
when
tulliver
called
wakem
a
rascal
at
the
market
the
attorneys
clients
were
not
a
whit
inclined
to
withdraw
their
business
from
him
and
if
when
wakem
himself
happened
to
be
present
some
jocose
stimulated
by
opportunity
and
brandy
made
a
thrust
at
him
by
alluding
to
old
ladies
wills
he
maintained
perfect
and
knew
quite
well
that
the
majority
of
substantial
men
then
present
were
perfectly
contented
with
the
fact
that
wakem
was
wakem
that
is
to
say
a
man
who
always
knew
the
that
would
carry
him
through
very
muddy
bits
of
practice
a
man
who
had
made
a
large
fortune
had
a
handsome
house
among
the
trees
at
tofton
and
decidedly
the
finest
stock
of
in
the
neighborhood
of
ogg
was
likely
to
feel
himself
on
a
level
with
public
opinion
and
i
am
not
sure
that
even
honest
tulliver
himself
with
his
general
view
of
law
as
a
cockpit
might
not
under
opposite
circumstances
have
seen
a
fine
appropriateness
in
the
truth
that
wakem
was
wakem
since
i
have
understood
from
persons
versed
in
history
that
mankind
is
not
disposed
to
look
narrowly
into
the
conduct
of
great
victors
when
their
victory
is
on
the
right
side
tulliver
then
could
be
no
obstruction
to
wakem
on
the
contrary
he
was
a
poor
devil
whom
the
lawyer
had
defeated
several
times
a
fellow
who
would
always
give
you
a
handle
against
him
wakem
conscience
was
not
uneasy
because
he
had
used
a
few
tricks
against
the
miller
why
should
he
hate
that
unsuccessful
plaintiff
that
pitiable
furious
bull
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
a
net
still
among
the
various
excesses
to
which
human
nature
is
subject
moralists
have
never
numbered
that
of
being
too
fond
of
the
people
who
openly
revile
us
the
successful
yellow
candidate
for
the
borough
of
old
topping
perhaps
feels
no
pursuant
meditative
hatred
toward
the
blue
editor
who
consoles
his
subscribers
with
vituperative
rhetoric
against
yellow
men
who
sell
their
country
and
are
the
demons
of
private
life
but
he
might
not
be
sorry
if
law
and
opportunity
favored
to
kick
that
blue
editor
to
a
deeper
shade
of
his
favorite
color
prosperous
men
take
a
little
vengeance
now
and
then
as
they
take
a
diversion
when
it
comes
easily
in
their
way
and
is
no
hindrance
to
business
and
such
small
unimpassioned
revenges
have
an
enormous
effect
in
life
running
through
all
degrees
of
pleasant
infliction
blocking
the
fit
men
out
of
places
and
blackening
characters
in
unpremeditated
talk
still
more
to
see
people
who
have
been
only
insignificantly
offensive
to
us
reduced
in
life
and
humiliated
without
any
special
effort
of
ours
is
apt
to
have
a
soothing
flattering
influence
providence
or
some
other
prince
of
this
world
it
appears
has
undertaken
the
task
of
retribution
for
us
and
really
by
an
agreeable
constitution
of
things
our
enemies
somehow
prosper
wakem
was
not
without
this
parenthetic
vindictiveness
toward
the
uncomplimentary
miller
and
now
tulliver
had
put
the
notion
into
his
head
it
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
pleasure
to
do
the
very
thing
that
would
cause
tulliver
the
most
deadly
mortification
and
a
pleasure
of
a
complex
kind
not
made
up
of
crude
malice
but
mingling
with
it
the
relish
of
to
see
an
enemy
humiliated
gives
a
certain
contentment
but
this
is
jejune
compared
with
the
highly
blent
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
humiliated
by
your
benevolent
action
or
concession
on
his
behalf
that
is
a
sort
of
revenge
which
falls
into
the
scale
of
virtue
and
wakem
was
not
without
an
intention
of
keeping
that
scale
respectably
filled
he
had
once
had
the
pleasure
of
putting
an
old
enemy
of
his
into
one
of
the
ogg
to
the
rebuilding
of
which
he
had
given
a
large
subscription
and
here
was
an
opportunity
of
providing
for
another
by
making
him
his
own
servant
such
things
give
a
completeness
to
prosperity
and
contribute
elements
of
agreeable
consciousness
that
are
not
dreamed
of
by
that
overheated
vindictiveness
which
goes
out
its
way
to
wreak
itself
in
direct
injury
and
tulliver
with
his
rough
tongue
filed
by
a
sense
of
obligation
would
make
a
better
servant
than
any
who
was
for
a
situation
tulliver
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
proud
honesty
and
wakem
was
too
acute
not
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
honesty
he
was
given
too
observing
individuals
not
to
judging
of
them
according
to
maxims
and
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
all
men
were
not
like
himself
besides
he
intended
to
overlook
the
whole
business
of
land
and
mill
pretty
closely
he
was
fond
of
these
practical
rural
matters
but
there
were
good
reasons
for
purchasing
dorlcote
mill
quite
apart
from
any
benevolent
vengeance
on
the
miller
it
was
really
a
capital
investment
besides
guest
were
going
to
bid
for
it
mr
guest
and
wakem
were
on
friendly
dining
terms
and
the
attorney
liked
to
predominate
over
a
and
who
was
a
little
too
loud
in
the
town
affairs
as
well
as
in
his
for
wakem
was
not
a
mere
man
of
business
he
was
considered
a
pleasant
fellow
in
the
upper
circles
of
ogg
chatted
amusingly
over
his
did
a
little
amateur
farming
and
had
certainly
been
an
excellent
husband
and
father
at
church
when
he
went
there
he
sat
under
the
handsomest
of
mural
monuments
erected
to
the
memory
of
his
wife
most
men
would
have
married
again
under
his
circumstances
but
he
was
said
to
be
more
tender
to
his
deformed
son
than
most
men
were
to
their
offspring
not
that
wakem
had
not
other
sons
beside
philip
but
toward
them
he
held
only
a
chiaroscuro
parentage
and
provided
for
them
in
a
grade
of
life
duly
beneath
his
own
in
this
fact
indeed
there
lay
the
clenching
motive
to
the
purchase
of
dorlcote
mill
while
tulliver
was
talking
it
had
occurred
to
the
lawyer
among
all
the
other
circumstances
of
the
case
that
this
purchase
would
in
a
few
years
to
come
furnish
a
highly
suitable
position
for
a
certain
favorite
lad
whom
he
meant
to
bring
on
in
the
world
these
were
the
mental
conditions
on
which
tulliver
had
undertaken
to
act
persuasively
and
had
failed
a
fact
which
may
receive
some
illustration
from
the
remark
of
a
great
philosopher
that
fail
in
preparing
their
bait
so
as
to
make
it
alluring
in
the
right
quarter
for
want
of
a
due
acquaintance
with
the
subjectivity
of
fishes
chapter
viii
daylight
on
the
wreck
it
was
a
clear
frosty
january
day
on
which
tulliver
first
came
downstairs
the
bright
sun
on
the
chestnut
boughs
and
the
roofs
opposite
his
window
had
made
him
impatiently
declare
that
he
would
be
caged
up
no
longer
he
thought
everywhere
would
be
more
cheery
under
this
sunshine
than
his
bedroom
for
he
knew
nothing
of
the
bareness
below
which
made
the
flood
of
sunshine
importunate
as
if
it
had
an
unfeeling
pleasure
in
showing
the
empty
places
and
the
marks
where
objects
once
had
been
the
impression
on
his
mind
that
it
was
but
yesterday
when
he
received
the
letter
from
gore
was
so
continually
implied
in
his
talk
and
the
attempts
to
convey
to
him
the
idea
that
many
weeks
had
passed
and
much
had
happened
since
then
had
been
so
soon
swept
away
by
recurrent
forgetfulness
that
even
turnbull
had
begun
to
despair
of
preparing
him
to
meet
the
facts
by
previous
knowledge
the
full
sense
of
the
present
could
only
be
imparted
gradually
by
new
experience
not
by
mere
words
which
must
remain
weaker
than
the
impressions
left
by
the
experience
this
resolution
to
come
downstairs
was
heard
with
trembling
by
the
wife
and
children
tulliver
said
tom
must
not
go
to
ogg
at
the
usual
hour
he
must
wait
and
see
his
father
downstairs
and
tom
complied
though
with
an
intense
inward
shrinking
from
the
painful
scene
the
hearts
of
all
three
had
been
more
deeply
dejected
than
ever
during
the
last
few
days
for
guest
had
not
bought
the
mill
both
mill
and
land
had
been
knocked
down
to
wakem
who
had
been
over
the
premises
and
had
laid
before
deane
and
glegg
in
presence
his
willingness
to
employ
tulliver
in
case
of
his
recovery
as
a
manager
of
the
business
this
proposition
had
occasioned
much
family
debating
uncles
and
aunts
were
almost
unanimously
of
opinion
that
such
an
offer
ought
not
to
be
rejected
when
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
but
a
feeling
in
mind
which
as
neither
aunts
nor
uncles
shared
it
was
regarded
as
entirely
unreasonable
and
childish
indeed
as
a
transferring
toward
wakem
of
that
indignation
and
hatred
which
tulliver
ought
properly
to
have
directed
against
himself
for
his
general
quarrelsomeness
and
his
special
exhibition
of
it
in
going
to
law
here
was
an
opportunity
for
tulliver
to
provide
for
his
wife
and
daughter
without
any
assistance
from
his
wife
relations
and
without
that
too
evident
descent
into
pauperism
which
makes
it
annoying
to
respectable
people
to
meet
the
degraded
member
of
the
family
by
the
wayside
tulliver
glegg
considered
must
be
made
to
feel
when
he
came
to
his
right
mind
that
he
could
never
humble
himself
enough
for
had
come
which
she
had
always
foreseen
would
come
of
his
insolence
in
time
past
to
them
as
were
the
best
friends
he
got
to
look
to
mr
glegg
and
deane
were
less
stern
in
their
views
but
they
both
of
them
thought
tulliver
had
done
enough
harm
by
his
crotchets
and
ought
to
put
them
out
of
the
question
when
a
livelihood
was
offered
him
wakem
showed
a
right
feeling
about
the
matter
had
no
grudge
against
tulliver
tom
had
protested
against
entertaining
the
proposition
he
like
his
father
to
be
under
wakem
he
thought
it
would
look
but
his
mother
main
distress
was
the
utter
impossibility
of
ever
turning
tulliver
round
about
wakem
or
getting
him
to
hear
reason
no
they
would
all
have
to
go
and
live
in
a
pigsty
on
purpose
to
spite
wakem
who
spoke
so
as
nobody
could
be
fairer
indeed
tulliver
mind
was
reduced
to
such
confusion
by
living
in
this
strange
medium
of
unaccountable
sorrow
against
which
she
continually
appealed
by
asking
oh
dear
what
i
done
to
deserve
worse
than
other
women
that
maggie
began
to
suspect
her
poor
mother
wits
were
quite
going
tom
she
said
when
they
were
out
of
their
father
room
together
we
try
to
make
father
understand
a
little
of
what
has
happened
before
he
goes
downstairs
but
we
must
get
my
mother
away
she
will
say
something
that
will
do
harm
ask
kezia
to
fetch
her
down
and
keep
her
engaged
with
something
in
the
kitchen
kezia
was
equal
to
the
task
having
declared
her
intention
of
staying
till
the
master
could
get
about
again
wage
or
no
wage
she
had
found
a
certain
recompense
in
keeping
a
strong
hand
over
her
mistress
scolding
her
for
moithering
herself
and
going
about
all
day
without
changing
her
cap
and
looking
as
if
she
was
mushed
altogether
this
time
of
trouble
was
rather
a
saturnalian
time
to
kezia
she
could
scold
her
betters
with
unreproved
freedom
on
this
particular
occasion
there
were
drying
clothes
to
be
fetched
in
she
wished
to
know
if
one
pair
of
hands
could
do
everything
and
out
and
observed
that
should
have
thought
it
would
be
good
for
tulliver
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
by
doing
that
needful
piece
of
work
poor
tulliver
went
submissively
downstairs
to
be
ordered
about
by
a
servant
was
the
last
remnant
of
her
household
dignities
she
would
soon
have
no
servant
to
scold
her
tulliver
was
resting
in
his
chair
a
little
after
the
fatigue
of
dressing
and
maggie
and
tom
were
seated
near
him
when
luke
entered
to
ask
if
he
should
help
master
downstairs
ay
ay
luke
stop
a
bit
sit
down
said
tulliver
pointing
his
stick
toward
a
chair
and
looking
at
him
with
that
pursuant
gaze
which
convalescent
persons
often
have
for
those
who
have
tended
them
reminding
one
of
an
infant
gazing
about
after
its
nurse
for
luke
had
been
a
constant
by
his
master
bed
how
the
water
now
eh
luke
said
tulliver
dix
has
been
choking
you
up
again
eh
no
sir
it
all
right
ay
i
thought
not
he
wo
be
in
a
hurry
at
that
again
now
been
to
settle
him
that
was
what
i
said
to
riley
yesterday
i
said
tulliver
leaned
forward
resting
his
elbows
on
the
armchair
and
looking
on
the
ground
as
if
in
search
of
something
striving
after
vanishing
images
like
a
man
struggling
against
a
doze
maggie
looked
at
tom
in
mute
distress
their
father
mind
was
so
far
off
the
present
which
would
thrust
itself
on
his
wandering
consciousness
tom
was
almost
ready
to
rush
away
with
that
impatience
of
painful
emotion
which
makes
one
of
the
differences
between
youth
and
maiden
man
and
woman
father
said
maggie
laying
her
hand
on
his
do
you
remember
that
riley
is
dead
dead
said
tulliver
sharply
looking
in
her
face
with
a
strange
examining
glance
yes
he
died
of
apoplexy
nearly
a
year
ago
i
remember
hearing
you
say
you
had
to
pay
money
for
him
and
he
left
his
daughters
badly
off
one
of
them
is
at
miss
firniss
where
i
been
to
school
you
know
ah
said
her
father
doubtfully
still
looking
in
her
face
but
as
soon
as
tom
began
to
speak
he
turned
to
look
at
with
the
same
inquiring
glances
as
if
he
were
rather
surprised
at
the
presence
of
these
two
young
people
whenever
his
mind
was
wandering
in
the
far
past
he
fell
into
this
oblivion
of
their
actual
faces
they
were
not
those
of
the
lad
and
the
little
wench
who
belonged
to
that
past
it
a
long
while
since
you
had
the
dispute
with
dix
father
said
tom
i
remember
your
talking
about
it
three
years
ago
before
i
went
to
school
at
stelling
i
been
at
school
there
three
years
do
you
remember
tulliver
threw
himself
backward
again
losing
the
childlike
outward
glance
under
a
rush
of
new
ideas
which
diverted
him
from
external
impressions
ay
ay
he
said
after
a
minute
or
two
i
paid
a
deal
money
i
was
determined
my
son
should
have
a
good
eddication
i
none
myself
and
i
felt
the
miss
of
it
and
he
want
no
other
fortin
that
what
i
say
if
wakem
was
to
get
the
better
of
me
again
the
thought
of
wakem
roused
new
vibrations
and
after
a
moment
pause
he
began
to
look
at
the
coat
he
had
on
and
to
feel
in
his
then
he
turned
to
tom
and
said
in
his
old
sharp
way
where
have
they
put
gore
letter
it
was
close
at
hand
in
a
drawer
for
he
had
often
asked
for
it
before
you
know
what
there
is
in
the
letter
father
said
tom
as
he
gave
it
to
him
to
be
sure
i
do
said
tulliver
rather
angrily
what
o
that
if
furley
ca
take
to
the
property
somebody
else
can
plenty
o
people
in
the
world
besides
furley
but
it
hindering
my
not
being
well
go
and
tell
to
get
the
horse
in
the
gig
luke
i
can
get
down
to
ogg
well
enough
gore
expecting
me
no
dear
father
maggie
burst
out
entreatingly
it
a
very
long
while
since
all
that
you
been
ill
a
great
many
weeks
more
than
two
months
everything
is
changed
tulliver
looked
at
them
all
three
alternately
with
a
startled
gaze
the
idea
that
much
had
happened
of
which
he
knew
nothing
had
often
transiently
arrested
him
before
but
it
came
upon
him
now
with
entire
novelty
yes
father
said
tom
in
answer
to
the
gaze
you
need
trouble
your
mind
about
business
until
you
are
quite
well
everything
is
settled
about
that
for
the
present
about
the
mill
and
the
land
and
the
debts
what
settled
then
said
his
father
angrily
do
you
take
on
too
much
bout
it
sir
said
luke
you
ha
paid
iverybody
if
you
could
that
what
i
said
to
master
tom
i
said
you
ha
paid
iverybody
if
you
could
good
luke
felt
after
the
manner
of
contented
men
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
servitude
that
sense
of
natural
fitness
in
rank
which
made
his
master
downfall
a
tragedy
to
him
he
was
urged
in
his
slow
way
to
say
something
that
would
express
his
share
in
the
family
sorrow
and
these
words
which
he
had
used
over
and
over
again
to
tom
when
he
wanted
to
decline
the
full
payment
of
his
fifty
pounds
out
of
the
children
money
were
the
most
ready
to
his
tongue
they
were
just
the
words
to
lay
the
most
painful
hold
on
his
bewildered
mind
paid
everybody
he
said
with
vehement
agitation
his
face
flushing
and
his
eye
lighting
up
why
what
have
they
made
me
a
oh
father
dear
father
said
maggie
who
thought
that
terrible
word
really
represented
the
fact
bear
it
well
because
we
love
you
your
children
will
always
love
you
tom
will
pay
them
all
he
says
he
will
when
he
a
man
she
felt
her
father
beginning
to
tremble
his
voice
trembled
too
as
he
said
after
a
few
moments
ay
my
little
wench
but
i
shall
never
live
twice
but
perhaps
you
will
live
to
see
me
pay
everybody
father
said
tom
speaking
with
a
great
effort
ah
my
lad
said
tulliver
shaking
his
head
slowly
but
broke
can
never
be
whole
again
it
be
your
doing
not
mine
then
looking
up
at
him
you
only
sixteen
it
an
fight
for
you
but
you
must
throw
it
at
your
father
the
raskills
have
been
too
many
for
him
i
given
you
a
good
eddication
that
start
you
something
in
his
throat
half
choked
the
last
words
the
flush
which
had
alarmed
his
children
because
it
had
so
often
preceded
a
recurrence
of
paralysis
had
subsided
and
his
face
looked
pale
and
tremulous
tom
said
nothing
he
was
still
struggling
against
his
inclination
to
rush
away
his
father
remained
quiet
a
minute
or
two
but
his
mind
did
not
seem
to
be
wandering
again
have
they
sold
me
up
then
he
said
more
calmly
as
if
he
were
possessed
simply
by
the
desire
to
know
what
had
happened
everything
is
sold
father
but
we
do
know
all
about
the
mill
and
the
land
yet
said
tom
anxious
to
ward
off
any
question
leading
to
the
fact
that
wakem
was
the
purchaser
you
must
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
room
look
very
bare
downstairs
father
said
maggie
but
there
your
chair
and
the
bureau
not
gone
let
us
go
help
me
down
luke
i
go
and
see
everything
said
tulliver
leaning
on
his
stick
and
stretching
out
his
other
hand
toward
luke
ay
sir
said
luke
as
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
master
you
make
up
your
mind
a
bit
better
when
you
seen
iverything
you
get
used
that
what
my
mother
says
about
her
shortness
breath
she
says
she
made
friends
now
though
she
fought
again
it
sore
when
it
just
come
on
maggie
ran
on
before
to
see
that
all
was
right
in
the
dreary
parlor
where
the
fire
dulled
by
the
frosty
sunshine
seemed
part
of
the
general
shabbiness
she
turned
her
father
chair
and
pushed
aside
the
table
to
make
an
easy
way
for
him
and
then
stood
with
a
beating
heart
to
see
him
enter
and
look
round
for
the
first
time
tom
advanced
before
him
carrying
the
and
stood
beside
maggie
on
the
hearth
of
those
two
young
hearts
tom
suffered
the
most
unmixed
pain
for
maggie
with
all
her
keen
susceptibility
yet
felt
as
if
the
sorrow
made
larger
room
for
her
love
to
flow
in
and
gave
to
her
passionate
nature
no
true
boy
feels
that
he
would
rather
go
and
slay
the
nemean
lion
or
perform
any
round
of
heroic
labors
than
endure
perpetual
appeals
to
his
pity
for
evils
over
which
he
can
make
no
conquest
tulliver
paused
just
inside
the
door
resting
on
luke
and
looking
round
him
at
all
the
bare
places
which
for
him
were
filled
with
the
shadows
of
departed
objects
the
daily
companions
of
his
life
his
faculties
seemed
to
be
renewing
their
strength
from
getting
a
footing
on
this
demonstration
of
the
senses
ah
he
said
slowly
moving
toward
his
chair
they
sold
me
up
they
sold
me
up
then
seating
himself
and
laying
down
his
stick
while
luke
left
the
room
he
looked
round
again
they
left
the
big
bible
he
said
it
got
everything
in
when
i
was
born
and
married
bring
it
me
tom
the
quarto
bible
was
laid
open
before
him
at
the
and
while
he
was
reading
with
slowly
travelling
eyes
tulliver
entered
the
room
but
stood
in
mute
surprise
to
find
her
husband
down
already
and
with
the
great
bible
before
him
ah
he
said
looking
at
a
spot
where
his
finger
rested
my
mother
was
margaret
beaton
she
died
when
she
was
hers
was
a
family
we
our
mother
children
gritty
and
me
are
we
shall
go
to
our
last
bed
before
long
he
seemed
to
be
pausing
over
the
record
of
his
sister
birth
and
marriage
as
if
it
were
suggesting
new
thoughts
to
him
then
he
suddenly
looked
up
at
tom
and
said
in
a
sharp
tone
of
alarm
they
have
come
upo
moss
for
the
money
as
i
lent
him
have
they
no
father
said
tom
the
note
was
burnt
tulliver
turned
his
eyes
on
the
page
again
and
presently
said
ah
elizabeth
dodson
it
eighteen
year
since
i
married
her
come
next
ladyday
said
tulliver
going
up
to
his
side
and
looking
at
the
page
her
husband
fixed
his
eyes
earnestly
on
her
face
poor
bessy
he
said
you
was
a
pretty
lass
then
everybody
said
so
and
i
used
to
think
you
kept
your
good
looks
rarely
but
sorely
aged
do
you
bear
me
i
meant
to
do
well
by
you
we
promised
one
another
for
better
or
for
worse
but
i
never
thought
it
be
so
for
worse
as
this
said
poor
tulliver
with
the
strange
scared
look
that
had
come
over
her
of
late
and
my
poor
father
gave
me
away
and
to
come
on
so
all
at
once
oh
mother
said
maggie
do
talk
in
that
way
no
i
know
you
wo
let
your
poor
mother
speak
that
been
the
way
all
my
life
your
father
never
minded
what
i
said
it
have
been
no
use
for
me
to
beg
and
pray
and
it
be
no
use
now
not
if
i
was
to
go
down
o
my
hands
and
knees
do
say
so
bessy
said
tulliver
whose
pride
in
these
first
moments
of
humiliation
was
in
abeyance
to
the
sense
of
some
justice
in
his
wife
reproach
it
there
anything
left
as
i
could
do
to
make
you
amends
i
would
say
you
nay
then
we
might
stay
here
and
get
a
living
and
i
might
keep
among
my
own
sisters
and
me
been
such
a
good
wife
to
you
and
never
crossed
you
from
week
end
to
week
end
and
they
all
say
so
they
say
it
be
nothing
but
right
only
you
so
turned
against
wakem
mother
said
tom
severely
this
is
not
the
time
to
talk
about
that
let
her
be
said
tulliver
say
what
you
mean
bessy
why
now
the
mill
and
the
land
all
wakem
and
he
got
everything
in
his
hands
what
the
use
o
setting
your
face
against
him
when
he
says
you
may
stay
here
and
speaks
as
fair
as
can
be
and
says
you
may
manage
the
business
and
have
thirty
shillings
and
a
horse
to
ride
about
to
market
and
where
have
we
got
to
put
our
heads
we
must
go
into
one
o
the
cottages
in
the
village
and
me
and
my
children
brought
down
to
that
and
all
because
you
must
set
your
mind
against
folks
till
there
no
turning
you
tulliver
had
sunk
back
in
his
chair
trembling
you
may
do
as
you
like
wi
me
bessy
he
said
in
a
low
voice
been
the
bringing
of
you
to
poverty
this
world
too
many
for
me
nought
but
a
bankrupt
it
no
use
standing
up
for
anything
now
father
said
tom
i
do
agree
with
my
mother
or
my
uncles
and
i
do
think
you
ought
to
submit
to
be
under
wakem
i
get
a
pound
now
and
you
can
find
something
else
to
do
when
you
get
well
say
no
more
tom
say
no
more
i
had
enough
for
this
day
give
me
a
kiss
bessy
and
let
us
bear
one
another
no
we
shall
never
be
young
again
this
world
been
too
many
for
me
chapter
ix
an
item
added
to
the
family
register
that
first
moment
of
renunciation
and
submission
was
followed
by
days
of
violent
struggle
in
the
miller
mind
as
the
gradual
access
of
bodily
strength
brought
with
it
increasing
ability
to
embrace
in
one
view
all
the
conflicting
conditions
under
which
he
found
himself
feeble
limbs
easily
resign
themselves
to
be
tethered
and
when
we
are
subdued
by
sickness
it
seems
possible
to
us
to
fulfil
pledges
which
the
old
vigor
comes
back
and
breaks
there
were
times
when
poor
tulliver
thought
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
to
bessy
was
something
quite
too
hard
for
human
nature
he
had
promised
her
without
knowing
what
she
was
going
to
say
she
might
as
well
have
asked
him
to
carry
a
ton
weight
on
his
back
but
again
there
were
many
feelings
arguing
on
her
side
besides
the
sense
that
life
had
been
made
hard
to
her
by
having
married
him
he
saw
a
possibility
by
much
pinching
of
saving
money
out
of
his
salary
toward
paying
a
second
dividend
to
his
creditors
and
it
would
not
be
easy
elsewhere
to
get
a
situation
such
as
he
could
fill
he
had
led
an
easy
life
ordering
much
and
working
little
and
had
no
aptitude
for
any
new
business
he
must
perhaps
take
to
and
his
wife
must
have
help
from
her
sisters
a
prospect
doubly
bitter
to
him
now
they
had
let
all
bessy
precious
things
be
sold
probably
because
they
liked
to
set
her
against
him
by
making
her
feel
that
he
had
brought
her
to
that
pass
he
listened
to
their
admonitory
talk
when
they
came
to
urge
on
him
what
he
was
bound
to
do
for
poor
sake
with
averted
eyes
that
every
now
and
then
flashed
on
them
furtively
when
their
backs
were
turned
nothing
but
the
dread
of
needing
their
help
could
have
made
it
an
easier
alternative
to
take
their
advice
but
the
strongest
influence
of
all
was
the
love
of
the
old
premises
where
he
had
run
about
when
he
was
a
boy
just
as
tom
had
done
after
him
the
tullivers
had
lived
on
this
spot
for
generations
and
he
had
sat
listening
on
a
low
stool
on
winter
evenings
while
his
father
talked
of
the
old
mill
that
had
been
there
before
the
last
great
floods
which
damaged
it
so
that
his
grandfather
pulled
it
down
and
built
the
new
one
it
was
when
he
got
able
to
walk
about
and
look
at
all
the
old
objects
that
he
felt
the
strain
of
his
clinging
affection
for
the
old
home
as
part
of
his
life
part
of
himself
he
could
bear
to
think
of
himself
living
on
any
other
spot
than
this
where
he
knew
the
sound
of
every
gate
door
and
felt
that
the
shape
and
color
of
every
roof
and
and
broken
hillock
was
good
because
his
growing
senses
had
been
fed
on
them
our
instructed
vagrancy
which
was
hardly
time
to
linger
by
the
hedgerows
but
runs
away
early
to
the
tropics
and
is
at
home
with
palms
and
banyans
which
is
nourished
on
books
of
travel
and
stretches
the
theatre
of
its
imagination
to
the
zambesi
can
hardly
get
a
dim
notion
of
what
an
man
like
tulliver
felt
for
this
spot
where
all
his
memories
centred
and
where
life
seemed
like
a
familiar
tool
that
the
fingers
clutch
with
loving
ease
and
just
now
he
was
living
in
that
freshened
memory
of
the
time
which
comes
to
us
in
the
passive
hours
of
recovery
from
sickness
ay
luke
he
said
one
afternoon
as
he
stood
looking
over
the
orchard
gate
i
remember
the
day
they
planted
those
my
father
was
a
huge
man
for
planting
it
was
like
a
to
him
to
get
a
cart
full
o
young
trees
and
i
used
to
stand
i
the
cold
with
him
and
follow
him
about
like
a
dog
then
he
turned
round
and
leaning
against
the
looked
at
the
opposite
buildings
the
old
mill
miss
me
i
think
luke
there
a
story
as
when
the
mill
changes
hands
the
river
angry
i
heard
my
father
say
it
many
a
time
there
no
telling
whether
there
may
be
summat
the
story
for
this
is
a
puzzling
world
and
old
harry
got
a
finger
in
it
it
been
too
many
for
me
i
know
ay
sir
said
luke
with
soothing
sympathy
what
wi
the
rust
on
the
wheat
an
the
firin
o
the
ricks
an
that
as
i
seen
i
my
time
things
often
looks
comical
there
the
bacon
fat
wi
our
last
pig
run
away
like
butter
it
leaves
nought
but
a
scratchin
it
just
as
if
it
was
yesterday
now
tulliver
went
on
when
my
father
began
the
malting
i
remember
the
day
they
finished
the

thought
summat
great
was
to
come
of
it
for

a
that
day
and
a
bit
of
a
feast

my
mother
she
was
a
fine
woman
my
mother
was
the
little
wench
be
as
like
her
as
two
peas
here
tulliver
put
his
stick
between
his
legs
and
took
out
his
for
the
greater
enjoyment
of
this
anecdote
which
dropped
from
him
in
fragments
as
if
he
every
other
moment
lost
narration
in
vision
i
was
a
little
chap
no
higher
much
than
my
mother
knee
she
was
sore
fond
of
us
children
gritty
and
me
and
so
i
said
to
her
i
said

day
because
o
the
she
used
to
tell
me
o
that
till
her
dying
day
she
was
but
a
young
woman
when
she
died
my
mother

but

year
since
they
finished
the
and
it
is
many
days
out
of
all

i
have
looked
out
into
the
yard
there
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
all
weathers
from
year
end
to
year

i
should
go
off
my
head
in
a
new
place
i
should
be
like
as

i
lost
my
way
all
hard
whichever
way
i
look
at
it
the
harness

but

but
what
they
gripe
you
the
walk
was
finished
in
silence
after
this
for
luke
had
disburthened
himself
of
thoughts
to
an
extent
that
left
his
conversational
resources
quite
barren
and
tulliver
had
relapsed
from
his
recollections
into
a
painful
meditation
on
the
choice
of
hardships
before
him
maggie
noticed
that
he
was
unusually
absent
that
evening
at
tea
and
afterward
he
sat
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
looking
at
the
ground
moving
his
lips
and
shaking
his
head
from
time
to
time
then
he
looked
hard
at
tulliver
who
was
knitting
opposite
him
then
at
maggie
who
as
she
bent
over
her
sewing
was
intensely
conscious
of
some
drama
going
forward
in
her
father
mind
suddenly
he
took
up
the
poker
and
broke
the
large
coal
fiercely
dear
heart
tulliver
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
said
his
wife
looking
up
in
alarm
it
very
wasteful
breaking
the
coal
and
we
got
hardly
any
large
coal
left
and
i
do
know
where
the
rest
is
to
come
from
i
do
think
you
quite
so
well
are
you
father
said
maggie
you
seem
uneasy
why
how
is
it
tom
does
come
said
tulliver
impatiently
dear
heart
is
it
time
i
must
go
and
get
his
supper
said
tulliver
laying
down
her
knitting
and
leaving
the
room
it
nigh
upon
eight
said
tulliver
he
be
here
soon
go
go
and
get
the
big
bible
and
open
it
at
the
beginning
where
everything
set
down
and
get
the
pen
and
ink
maggie
obeyed
wondering
but
her
father
gave
no
further
orders
and
only
sat
listening
for
tom
footfall
on
the
gravel
apparently
irritated
by
the
wind
which
had
risen
and
was
roaring
so
as
to
drown
all
other
sounds
there
was
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
that
rather
frightened
maggie
began
to
wish
that
tom
would
come
too
there
he
is
then
said
tulliver
in
an
excited
way
when
the
knock
came
at
last
maggie
went
to
open
the
door
but
her
mother
came
out
of
the
kitchen
hurriedly
saying
stop
a
bit
maggie
i
open
it
tulliver
had
begun
to
be
a
little
frightened
at
her
boy
but
she
was
jealous
of
every
office
others
did
for
him
your
supper
ready
by
the
my
boy
she
said
as
he
took
off
his
hat
and
coat
you
shall
have
it
by
yourself
just
as
you
like
and
i
wo
speak
to
you
i
think
my
father
wants
tom
mother
said
maggie
he
must
come
into
the
parlor
first
tom
entered
with
his
usual
saddened
evening
face
but
his
eyes
fell
immediately
on
the
open
bible
and
the
inkstand
and
he
glanced
with
a
look
of
anxious
surprise
at
his
father
who
was
saying
come
come
you
late
i
want
you
is
there
anything
the
matter
father
said
tom
you
sit
down
all
of
you
said
tulliver
peremptorily
and
tom
sit
down
here
i
got
something
for
you
to
write
i
the
bible
they
all
three
sat
down
looking
at
him
he
began
to
speak
slowly
looking
first
at
his
wife
i
made
up
my
mind
bessy
and
i
be
as
good
as
my
word
to
you
there
be
the
same
grave
made
for
us
to
lie
down
in
and
we
be
bearing
one
another
i
stop
in
the
old
place
and
serve
under
wakem
and
i
serve
him
like
an
honest
man
there
no
tulliver
but
what
honest
mind
that
tom
here
his
voice
rose
they
have
it
to
throw
up
against
me
as
i
paid
a
dividend
but
it
was
my
fault
it
was
because
there
raskills
in
the
world
they
been
too
many
for
me
and
i
must
give
in
i
put
my
neck
in
harness
for
you
a
right
to
say
as
i
brought
you
into
trouble
bessy
and
i
serve
him
as
honest
as
if
he
was
no
raskill
i
an
honest
man
though
i
shall
never
hold
my
head
up
no
more
i
a
tree
as
is
broke
a
tree
as
is
broke
he
paused
and
looked
on
the
ground
then
suddenly
raising
his
head
he
said
in
a
louder
yet
deeper
tone
but
i
wo
forgive
him
i
know
what
they
say
he
never
meant
me
any
harm
that
the
way
old
harry
props
up
the
rascals
he
been
at
the
bottom
of
everything
but
he
a
fine
gentleman
i
know
i
know
i
should
ha
gone
to
law
they
say
but
who
made
it
so
as
there
was
no
arbitratin
and
no
justice
to
be
got
it
signifies
nothing
to
him
i
know
that
he
one
o
them
fine
gentlemen
as
get
money
by
doing
business
for
poorer
folks
and
when
he
made
beggars
of
give
charity
i
wo
forgive
him
i
wish
he
might
be
punished
with
shame
till
his
own
son
like
to
forget
him
i
wish
he
may
do
summat
as
they
make
him
work
at
the
treadmill
but
he
wo
too
big
a
raskill
to
let
the
law
lay
hold
on
him
and
you
mind
this
tom
you
never
forgive
him
neither
if
you
mean
to
be
my
son
there
maybe
come
a
time
when
you
may
make
him
feel
it
never
come
to
me
got
my
head
under
the
yoke
now
write
write
it
i
the
bible
oh
father
what
said
maggie
sinking
down
by
his
knee
pale
and
trembling
it
wicked
to
curse
and
bear
malice
it
is
wicked
i
tell
you
said
her
father
fiercely
it
wicked
as
the
raskills
should
prosper

the
devil
doing
do
as
i
tell
you
tom
write
what
am
i
to
write
said
tom
with
gloomy
submission
write
as
your
father
edward
tulliver
took
service
under
john
wakem
the
man
as
had
helped
to
ruin
him
because
i
promised
my
wife
to
make
her
what
amends
i
could
for
her
trouble
and
because
i
wanted
to
die
in
th
old
place
where
i
was
born
and
my
father
was
born
put
that
i
the
right
words
you
know
how
and
then
write
as
i
do
forgive
wakem
for
all
that
and
for
all
i
serve
him
honest
i
wish
evil
may
befall
him
write
that
there
was
a
dead
silence
as
tom
pen
moved
along
the
paper
tulliver
looked
scared
and
maggie
trembled
like
a
leaf
now
let
me
hear
what
you
wrote
said
tulliver
tom
read
aloud
slowly
now
write
write
as
you
remember
what
wakem
done
to
your
father
and
you
make
him
and
his
feel
it
if
ever
the
day
comes
and
sign
your
name
thomas
tulliver
oh
no
father
dear
father
said
maggie
almost
choked
with
fear
you
should
make
tom
write
that
be
quiet
maggie
said
tom
i
write
it
book
iv
valley
of
chapter
i
a
variation
of
protestantism
unknown
to
bossuet
journeying
down
the
rhone
on
a
summer
day
you
have
perhaps
felt
the
sunshine
made
dreary
by
those
ruined
villages
which
stud
the
banks
in
certain
parts
of
its
course
telling
how
the
swift
river
once
rose
like
an
angry
destroying
god
sweeping
down
the
feeble
generations
whose
breath
is
in
their
nostrils
and
making
their
dwellings
a
desolation
strange
contrast
you
may
have
thought
between
the
effect
produced
on
us
by
these
dismal
remnants
of
commonplace
houses
which
in
their
best
days
were
but
the
sign
of
a
sordid
life
belonging
in
all
its
details
to
our
own
vulgar
era
and
the
effect
produced
by
those
ruins
on
the
castled
rhine
which
have
crumbled
and
mellowed
into
such
harmony
with
the
green
and
rocky
steeps
that
they
seem
to
have
a
natural
fitness
like
the
nay
even
in
the
day
when
they
were
built
they
must
have
had
this
fitness
as
if
they
had
been
raised
by
an
race
who
had
inherited
from
their
mighty
parent
a
sublime
instinct
of
form
and
that
was
a
day
of
romance
if
those
were
somewhat
grim
and
drunken
ogres
they
had
a
certain
grandeur
of
the
wild
beast
in
them
they
were
forest
boars
with
tusks
tearing
and
rending
not
the
ordinary
domestic
grunter
they
represented
the
demon
forces
forever
in
collision
with
beauty
virtue
and
the
gentle
uses
of
life
they
made
a
fine
contrast
in
the
picture
with
the
wandering
minstrel
the
princess
the
pious
recluse
and
the
timid
israelite
that
was
a
time
of
color
when
the
sunlight
fell
on
glancing
steel
and
floating
banners
a
time
of
adventure
and
fierce
struggle
nay
of
living
religious
art
and
religious
enthusiasm
for
were
not
cathedrals
built
in
those
days
and
did
not
great
emperors
leave
their
western
palaces
to
die
before
the
infidel
strongholds
in
the
sacred
east
therefore
it
is
that
these
rhine
castles
thrill
me
with
a
sense
of
poetry
they
belong
to
the
grand
historic
life
of
humanity
and
raise
up
for
me
the
vision
of
an
echo
but
these
angular
skeletons
of
villages
on
the
rhone
oppress
me
with
the
feeling
that
human
life
very
much
of
it
is
a
narrow
ugly
grovelling
existence
which
even
calamity
does
not
elevate
but
rather
tends
to
exhibit
in
all
its
bare
vulgarity
of
conception
and
i
have
a
cruel
conviction
that
the
lives
these
ruins
are
the
traces
of
were
part
of
a
gross
sum
of
obscure
vitality
that
will
be
swept
into
the
same
oblivion
with
the
generations
of
ants
and
beavers
perhaps
something
akin
to
this
oppressive
feeling
may
have
weighed
upon
you
in
watching
this
family
life
on
the
banks
of
the
floss
which
even
sorrow
hardly
suffices
to
lift
above
the
level
of
the
it
is
a
sordid
life
you
say
this
of
the
tullivers
and
dodsons
irradiated
by
no
sublime
principles
no
romantic
visions
no
active
faith
moved
by
none
of
those
wild
uncontrollable
passions
which
create
the
dark
shadows
of
misery
and
crime
without
that
primitive
rough
simplicity
of
wants
that
hard
submissive
toil
that
childlike
of
what
nature
has
written
which
gives
its
poetry
to
peasant
life
here
one
has
conventional
worldly
notions
and
habits
without
instruction
and
without
polish
surely
the
most
prosaic
form
of
human
life
proud
respectability
in
a
gig
of
unfashionable
build
worldliness
without
observing
these
people
narrowly
even
when
the
iron
hand
of
misfortune
has
shaken
them
from
their
unquestioning
hold
on
the
world
one
sees
little
trace
of
religion
still
less
of
a
distinctively
christian
creed
their
belief
in
the
unseen
so
far
as
it
manifests
itself
at
all
seems
to
be
rather
a
pagan
kind
their
moral
notions
though
held
with
strong
tenacity
seem
to
have
no
standard
beyond
hereditary
custom
you
could
not
live
among
such
people
you
are
stifled
for
want
of
an
outlet
toward
something
beautiful
great
or
noble
you
are
irritated
with
these
dull
men
and
women
as
a
kind
of
population
out
of
keeping
with
the
earth
on
which
they
live
with
this
rich
plain
where
the
great
river
flows
forever
onward
and
links
the
small
pulse
of
the
old
english
town
with
the
beatings
of
the
world
mighty
heart
a
vigorous
superstition
that
lashes
its
gods
or
lashes
its
own
back
seems
to
be
more
congruous
with
the
mystery
of
the
human
lot
than
the
mental
condition
of
these
dodsons
and
tullivers
i
share
with
you
this
sense
of
oppressive
narrowness
but
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
feel
it
if
we
care
to
understand
how
it
acted
on
the
lives
of
tom
and
maggie
how
it
has
acted
on
young
natures
in
many
generations
that
in
the
onward
tendency
of
human
things
have
risen
above
the
mental
level
of
the
generation
before
them
to
which
they
have
been
nevertheless
tied
by
the
strongest
fibres
of
their
hearts
the
suffering
whether
of
martyr
or
victim
which
belongs
to
every
historical
advance
of
mankind
is
represented
in
this
way
in
every
town
and
by
hundreds
of
obscure
hearths
and
we
need
not
shrink
from
this
comparison
of
small
things
with
great
for
does
not
science
tell
us
that
its
highest
striving
is
after
the
ascertainment
of
a
unity
which
shall
bind
the
smallest
things
with
the
greatest
in
natural
science
i
have
understood
there
is
nothing
petty
to
the
mind
that
has
a
large
vision
of
relations
and
to
which
every
single
object
suggests
a
vast
sum
of
conditions
it
is
surely
the
same
with
the
observation
of
human
life
certainly
the
religious
and
moral
ideas
of
the
dodsons
and
tullivers
were
of
too
specific
a
kind
to
be
arrived
at
deductively
from
the
statement
that
they
were
part
of
the
protestant
population
of
great
britain
their
theory
of
life
had
its
core
of
soundness
as
all
theories
must
have
on
which
decent
and
prosperous
families
have
been
reared
and
have
flourished
but
it
had
the
very
slightest
tincture
of
theology
if
in
the
maiden
days
of
the
dodson
sisters
their
bibles
opened
more
easily
at
some
parts
than
others
it
was
because
of
dried
which
had
been
distributed
quite
impartially
without
preference
for
the
historical
devotional
or
doctrinal
their
religion
was
of
a
simple
kind
but
there
was
no
heresy
in
it
if
heresy
properly
means
choice
for
they
did
know
there
was
any
other
religion
except
that
of
which
appeared
to
run
in
families
like
asthma
how
they
know
the
vicar
of
their
pleasant
rural
parish
was
not
a
controversialist
but
a
good
hand
at
whist
and
one
who
had
a
joke
always
ready
for
a
blooming
female
parishioner
the
religion
of
the
dodsons
consisted
in
revering
whatever
was
customary
and
respectable
it
was
necessary
to
be
baptized
else
one
could
not
be
buried
in
the
and
to
take
the
sacrament
before
death
as
a
security
against
more
dimly
understood
perils
but
it
was
of
equal
necessity
to
have
the
proper
and
hams
at
one
funeral
and
to
leave
an
unimpeachable
will
a
dodson
would
not
be
taxed
with
the
omission
of
anything
that
was
becoming
or
that
belonged
to
that
eternal
fitness
of
things
which
was
plainly
indicated
in
the
practice
of
the
most
substantial
parishioners
and
in
the
family
traditions
such
as
obedience
to
parents
faithfulness
to
kindred
industry
rigid
honesty
thrift
the
thorough
scouring
of
wooden
and
copper
utensils
the
hoarding
of
coins
likely
to
disappear
from
the
currency
the
production
of
commodities
for
the
market
and
the
general
preference
of
whatever
was
the
dodsons
were
a
very
proud
race
and
their
pride
lay
in
the
utter
frustration
of
all
desire
to
tax
them
with
a
breach
of
traditional
duty
or
propriety
a
wholesome
pride
in
many
respects
since
it
identified
honor
with
perfect
integrity
thoroughness
of
work
and
faithfulness
to
admitted
rules
and
society
owes
some
worthy
qualities
in
many
of
her
members
to
mothers
of
the
dodson
class
who
made
their
butter
and
their
fromenty
well
and
would
have
felt
disgraced
to
make
it
otherwise
to
be
honest
and
poor
was
never
a
dodson
motto
still
less
to
seem
rich
though
being
poor
rather
the
family
badge
was
to
be
honest
and
rich
and
not
only
rich
but
richer
than
was
supposed
to
live
respected
and
have
the
proper
bearers
at
your
funeral
was
an
achievement
of
the
ends
of
existence
that
would
be
entirely
nullified
if
on
the
reading
of
your
will
you
sank
in
the
opinion
of
your
either
by
turning
out
to
be
poorer
than
they
expected
or
by
leaving
your
money
in
a
capricious
manner
without
strict
regard
to
degrees
of
kin
the
right
thing
must
always
be
done
toward
kindred
the
right
thing
was
to
correct
them
severely
if
they
were
other
than
a
credit
to
the
family
but
still
not
to
alienate
from
them
the
smallest
rightful
share
in
the
family
shoebuckles
and
other
property
a
conspicuous
quality
in
the
dodson
character
was
its
genuineness
its
vices
and
virtues
alike
were
phases
of
a
proud
honest
egoism
which
had
a
hearty
dislike
to
whatever
made
against
its
own
credit
and
interest
and
would
be
frankly
hard
of
speech
to
inconvenient
kin
but
would
never
forsake
or
ignore
them
would
not
let
them
want
bread
but
only
require
them
to
eat
it
with
bitter
herbs
the
same
sort
of
traditional
belief
ran
in
the
tulliver
veins
but
it
was
carried
in
richer
blood
having
elements
of
generous
imprudence
warm
affection
and
rashness
tulliver
grandfather
had
been
heard
to
say
that
he
was
descended
from
one
ralph
tulliver
a
wonderfully
clever
fellow
who
had
ruined
himself
it
is
likely
enough
that
the
clever
ralph
was
a
high
liver
rode
spirited
horses
and
was
very
decidedly
of
his
own
opinion
on
the
other
hand
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
a
dodson
who
had
ruined
himself
it
was
not
the
way
of
that
family
if
such
were
the
views
of
life
on
which
the
dodsons
and
tullivers
had
been
reared
in
the
praiseworthy
past
of
pitt
and
high
prices
you
will
infer
from
what
you
already
know
concerning
the
state
of
society
in
ogg
that
there
had
been
no
highly
modifying
influence
to
act
on
them
in
their
maturer
life
it
was
still
possible
even
in
that
later
time
of
preaching
for
people
to
hold
many
pagan
ideas
and
believe
themselves
good
notwithstanding
so
we
need
hardly
feel
any
surprise
at
the
fact
that
tulliver
though
a
regular
recorded
his
vindictiveness
on
the
of
his
bible
it
was
not
that
any
harm
could
be
said
concerning
the
vicar
of
that
charming
rural
parish
to
which
dorlcote
mill
belonged
he
was
a
man
of
excellent
family
an
irreproachable
bachelor
of
elegant
pursuits
had
taken
honors
and
held
a
fellowship
tulliver
regarded
him
with
dutiful
respect
as
he
did
everything
else
belonging
to
the
but
he
considered
that
church
was
one
thing
and
another
and
he
wanted
nobody
to
tell
what
commonsense
was
certain
seeds
which
are
required
to
find
a
nidus
for
themselves
under
unfavorable
circumstances
have
been
supplied
by
nature
with
an
apparatus
of
hooks
so
that
they
will
get
a
hold
on
very
unreceptive
surfaces
the
spiritual
seed
which
had
been
scattered
over
tulliver
had
apparently
been
destitute
of
any
corresponding
provision
and
had
slipped
off
to
the
winds
again
from
a
total
absence
of
hooks

is

sustaining
in

agitation
that
accompanies

shocks
of
trouble
just
as
an
acute

a

this
time
of
utmost
need
was
come
to
maggie
with
her
short
span
of
thirteen
years
to
the
usual
precocity
of
the
girl
she
added
that
early
experience
of
struggle
of
conflict
between
the
inward
impulse
and
outward
fact
which
is
the
lot
of
every
imaginative
and
passionate
nature
and
the
years
since
she
hammered
the
nails
into
her
wooden
fetish
among
the
shelves
of
the
attic
had
been
filled
with
so
eager
a
life
in
the
triple
world
of
reality
books
and
waking
dreams
that
maggie
was
strangely
old
for
her
years
in
everything
except
in
her
entire
want
of
that
prudence
and
which
were
the
qualities
that
made
tom
manly
in
the
midst
of
his
intellectual
boyishness
and
now
her
lot
was
beginning
to
have
a
still
sad
monotony
which
threw
her
more
than
ever
on
her
inward
self
her
father
was
able
to
attend
to
business
again
his
affairs
were
settled
and
he
was
acting
as
wakem
manager
on
the
old
spot
tom
went
to
and
fro
every
morning
and
evening
and
became
more
and
more
silent
in
the
short
intervals
at
home
what
was
there
to
say
one
day
was
like
another
and
tom
interest
in
life
driven
back
and
crushed
on
every
other
side
was
concentrating
itself
into
the
one
channel
of
ambitious
resistance
to
misfortune
the
peculiarities
of
his
father
and
mother
were
very
irksome
to
him
now
they
were
laid
bare
of
all
the
softening
accompaniments
of
an
easy
prosperous
home
for
tom
had
very
clear
prosaic
eyes
not
apt
to
be
dimmed
by
mists
of
feeling
or
imagination
poor
tulliver
it
seemed
would
never
recover
her
old
self
her
placid
household
activity
how
could
she
the
objects
among
which
her
mind
had
moved
complacently
were
all
gone
all
the
little
hopes
and
schemes
and
speculations
all
the
pleasant
little
cares
about
her
treasures
which
had
made
the
world
quite
comprehensible
to
her
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
since
she
had
made
her
first
purchase
of
the
had
been
suddenly
snatched
away
from
her
and
she
remained
bewildered
in
this
empty
life
why
that
should
have
happened
to
her
which
had
not
happened
to
other
women
remained
an
insoluble
question
by
which
she
expressed
her
perpetual
ruminating
comparison
of
the
past
with
the
present
it
was
piteous
to
see
the
comely
woman
getting
thinner
and
more
worn
under
a
bodily
as
well
as
mental
restlessness
which
made
her
often
wander
about
the
empty
house
after
her
work
was
done
until
maggie
becoming
alarmed
about
her
would
seek
her
and
bring
her
down
by
telling
her
how
it
vexed
tom
that
she
was
injuring
her
health
by
never
sitting
down
and
resting
herself
yet
amidst
this
helpless
imbecility
there
was
a
touching
trait
of
humble
maternity
which
made
maggie
feel
tenderly
toward
her
poor
mother
amidst
all
the
little
wearing
griefs
caused
by
her
mental
feebleness
she
would
let
maggie
do
none
of
the
work
that
was
heaviest
and
most
soiling
to
the
hands
and
was
quite
peevish
when
maggie
attempted
to
relieve
her
from
her
and
scouring
let
it
alone
my
dear
your
hands
get
as
hard
as
hard
she
would
say
it
your
mother
place
to
do
that
i
ca
do
the
sewing
my
eyes
fail
me
and
she
would
still
brush
and
carefully
tend
maggie
hair
which
she
had
become
reconciled
to
in
spite
of
its
refusal
to
curl
now
it
was
so
long
and
massy
maggie
was
not
her
pet
child
and
in
general
would
have
been
much
better
if
she
had
been
quite
different
yet
the
womanly
heart
so
bruised
in
its
small
personal
desires
found
a
future
to
rest
on
in
the
life
of
this
young
thing
and
the
mother
pleased
herself
with
wearing
out
her
own
hands
to
save
the
hands
that
had
so
much
more
life
in
them
but
the
constant
presence
of
her
mother
regretful
bewilderment
was
less
painful
to
maggie
than
that
of
her
father
sullen
incommunicative
depression
as
long
as
the
paralysis
was
upon
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
always
be
in
a
childlike
condition
of
dependence
as
long
as
he
was
still
only
half
awakened
to
his
trouble
maggie
had
felt
the
strong
tide
of
pitying
love
almost
as
an
inspiration
a
new
power
that
would
make
the
most
difficult
life
easy
for
his
sake
but
now
instead
of
childlike
dependence
there
had
come
a
taciturn
hard
concentration
of
purpose
in
strange
contrast
with
his
old
vehement
communicativeness
and
high
spirit
and
this
lasted
from
day
to
day
and
from
week
to
week
the
dull
eye
never
brightening
with
any
eagerness
or
any
joy
it
is
something
cruelly
incomprehensible
to
youthful
natures
this
sombre
sameness
in
and
elderly
people
whose
life
has
resulted
in
disappointment
and
discontent
to
whose
faces
a
smile
becomes
so
strange
that
the
sad
lines
all
about
the
lips
and
brow
seem
to
take
no
notice
of
it
and
it
hurries
away
again
for
want
of
a
welcome
why
will
they
not
kindle
up
and
be
glad
sometimes
thinks
young
elasticity
it
would
be
so
easy
if
they
only
liked
to
do
it
and
these
leaden
clouds
that
never
part
are
apt
to
create
impatience
even
in
the
filial
affection
that
streams
forth
in
nothing
but
tenderness
and
pity
in
the
time
of
more
obvious
affliction
tulliver
lingered
nowhere
away
from
home
he
hurried
away
from
market
he
refused
all
invitations
to
stay
and
chat
as
in
old
times
in
the
houses
where
he
called
on
business
he
could
not
be
reconciled
with
his
lot
there
was
no
attitude
in
which
his
pride
did
not
feel
its
bruises
and
in
all
behavior
toward
him
whether
kind
or
cold
he
detected
an
allusion
to
the
change
in
his
circumstances
even
the
days
on
which
wakem
came
to
ride
round
the
land
and
inquire
into
the
business
were
not
so
black
to
him
as
those
on
which
he
had
met
several
creditors
who
had
accepted
a
composition
from
him
to
save
something
toward
the
repayment
of
those
creditors
was
the
object
toward
which
he
was
now
bending
all
his
thoughts
and
efforts
and
under
the
influence
of
this
demand
of
his
nature
the
somewhat
profuse
man
who
hated
to
be
stinted
or
to
stint
any
one
else
in
his
own
house
was
gradually
metamorphosed
into
the
grudger
of
morsels
tulliver
could
not
economize
enough
to
satisfy
him
in
their
food
and
firing
and
he
would
eat
nothing
himself
but
what
was
of
the
coarsest
quality
tom
though
depressed
and
strongly
repelled
by
his
father
sullenness
and
the
dreariness
of
home
entered
thoroughly
into
his
father
feelings
about
paying
the
creditors
and
the
poor
lad
brought
his
first
quarter
money
with
a
delicious
sense
of
achievement
and
gave
it
to
his
father
to
put
into
the
tin
box
which
held
the
savings
the
little
store
of
sovereigns
in
the
tin
box
seemed
to
be
the
only
sight
that
brought
a
faint
beam
of
pleasure
into
the
miller
eyes
faint
and
transient
for
it
was
soon
dispelled
by
the
thought
that
the
time
would
be
long
perhaps
longer
than
his
life
before
the
narrow
savings
could
remove
the
hateful
incubus
of
debt
a
deficit
of
more
than
five
hundred
pounds
with
the
accumulating
interest
seemed
a
deep
pit
to
fill
with
the
savings
from
thirty
shillings
even
when
probable
savings
were
to
be
added
on
this
one
point
there
was
entire
community
of
feeling
in
the
four
widely
differing
beings
who
sat
round
the
dying
fire
of
sticks
which
made
a
cheap
warmth
for
them
on
the
verge
of
bedtime
tulliver
carried
the
proud
integrity
of
the
dodsons
in
her
blood
and
had
been
brought
up
to
think
that
to
wrong
people
of
their
money
which
was
another
phrase
for
debt
was
a
sort
of
moral
pillory
it
would
have
been
wickedness
to
her
mind
to
have
run
counter
to
her
husband
desire
to
do
the
right
thing
and
retrieve
his
name
she
had
a
confused
dreamy
notion
that
if
the
creditors
were
all
paid
her
plate
and
linen
ought
to
come
back
to
her
but
she
had
an
inbred
perception
that
while
people
owed
money
they
were
unable
to
pay
they
could
rightly
call
anything
their
own
she
murmured
a
little
that
tulliver
so
peremptorily
refused
to
receive
anything
in
repayment
from
and
moss
but
to
all
his
requirements
of
household
economy
she
was
submissive
to
the
point
of
denying
herself
the
cheapest
indulgences
of
mere
flavor
her
only
rebellion
was
to
smuggle
into
the
kitchen
something
that
would
make
rather
a
better
supper
than
usual
for
tom
these
narrow
notions
about
debt
held
by
the
old
fashioned
tullivers
may
perhaps
excite
a
smile
on
the
faces
of
many
readers
in
these
days
of
wide
commercial
views
and
wide
philosophy
according
to
which
everything
rights
itself
without
any
trouble
of
ours
the
fact
that
my
tradesman
is
out
of
pocket
by
me
is
to
be
looked
at
through
the
serene
certainty
that
somebody
else
tradesman
is
in
pocket
by
somebody
else
and
since
there
must
be
bad
debts
in
the
world
why
it
is
mere
egoism
not
to
like
that
we
in
particular
should
make
them
instead
of
our
i
am
telling
the
history
of
very
simple
people
who
had
never
had
any
illuminating
doubts
as
to
personal
integrity
and
honor
under
all
this
grim
melancholy
and
narrowing
concentration
of
desire
tulliver
retained
the
feeling
toward
his
little
wench
which
made
her
presence
a
need
to
him
though
it
would
not
suffice
to
cheer
him
she
was
still
the
desire
of
his
eyes
but
the
sweet
spring
of
fatherly
love
was
now
mingled
with
bitterness
like
everything
else
when
maggie
laid
down
her
work
at
night
it
was
her
habit
to
get
a
low
stool
and
sit
by
her
father
knee
leaning
her
cheek
against
it
how
she
wished
he
would
stroke
her
head
or
give
some
sign
that
he
was
soothed
by
the
sense
that
he
had
a
daughter
who
loved
him
but
now
she
got
no
answer
to
her
little
caresses
either
from
her
father
or
from
tom
the
two
idols
of
her
life
tom
was
weary
and
abstracted
in
the
short
intervals
when
he
was
at
home
and
her
father
was
bitterly
preoccupied
with
the
thought
that
the
girl
was
growing
up
was
shooting
up
into
a
woman
and
how
was
she
to
do
well
in
life
she
had
a
poor
chance
for
marrying
down
in
the
world
as
they
were
and
he
hated
the
thought
of
her
marrying
poorly
as
her
aunt
gritty
had
done
would
be
a
thing
to
make
him
turn
in
his
grave
the
little
wench
so
pulled
down
by
children
and
toil
as
her
aunt
moss
was
when
uncultured
minds
confined
to
a
narrow
range
of
personal
experience
are
under
the
pressure
of
continued
misfortune
their
inward
life
is
apt
to
become
a
perpetually
repeated
round
of
sad
and
bitter
thoughts
the
same
words
the
same
scenes
are
revolved
over
and
over
again
the
same
mood
accompanies
them
the
end
of
the
year
finds
them
as
much
what
they
were
at
the
beginning
as
if
they
were
machines
set
to
a
recurrent
series
of
movements
the
sameness
of
the
days
was
broken
by
few
visitors
uncles
and
aunts
paid
only
short
visits
now
of
course
they
could
not
stay
to
meals
and
the
constraint
caused
by
tulliver
savage
silence
which
seemed
to
add
to
the
hollow
resonance
of
the
bare
uncarpeted
room
when
the
aunts
were
talking
heightened
the
unpleasantness
of
these
family
visits
on
all
sides
and
tended
to
make
them
rare
as
for
other
acquaintances
there
is
a
chill
air
surrounding
those
who
are
down
in
the
world
and
people
are
glad
to
get
away
from
them
as
from
a
cold
room
human
beings
mere
men
and
women
without
furniture
without
anything
to
offer
you
who
have
ceased
to
count
as
anybody
present
an
embarrassing
negation
of
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
them
or
of
subjects
on
which
to
converse
with
them
at
that
distant
day
there
was
a
dreary
isolation
in
the
civilized
christian
society
of
these
realms
for
families
that
had
dropped
below
their
original
level
unless
they
belonged
to
a
sectarian
church
which
gets
some
warmth
of
brotherhood
by
walling
in
the
sacred
fire
chapter
iii
a
voice
from
the
past
one
afternoon
when
the
chestnuts
were
coming
into
flower
maggie
had
brought
her
chair
outside
the
front
door
and
was
seated
there
with
a
book
on
her
knees
her
dark
eyes
had
wandered
from
the
book
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
enjoying
the
sunshine
which
pierced
the
screen
of
jasmine
on
the
projecting
porch
at
her
right
and
threw
leafy
shadows
on
her
pale
round
cheek
they
seemed
rather
to
be
searching
for
something
that
was
not
disclosed
by
the
sunshine
it
had
been
a
more
miserable
day
than
usual
her
father
after
a
visit
of
wakem
had
had
a
paroxysm
of
rage
in
which
for
some
trifling
fault
he
had
beaten
the
boy
who
served
in
the
mill
once
before
since
his
illness
he
had
had
a
similar
paroxysm
in
which
he
had
beaten
his
horse
and
the
scene
had
left
a
lasting
terror
in
maggie
mind
the
thought
had
risen
that
some
time
or
other
he
might
beat
her
mother
if
she
happened
to
speak
in
her
feeble
way
at
the
wrong
moment
the
keenest
of
all
dread
with
her
was
lest
her
father
should
add
to
his
present
misfortune
the
wretchedness
of
doing
something
irretrievably
disgraceful
the
battered
of
tom
which
she
held
on
her
knees
could
give
her
no
fortitude
under
the
pressure
of
that
dread
and
again
and
again
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
as
they
wandered
vaguely
seeing
neither
the
nor
the
distant
horizon
but
only
future
scenes
of
suddenly
she
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
gate
and
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
it
was
not
tom
who
was
entering
but
a
man
in
a
sealskin
cap
and
a
blue
plush
waistcoat
carrying
a
pack
on
his
back
and
followed
closely
by
a
bullterrier
of
brindled
coat
and
defiant
aspect
oh
bob
it
you
said
maggie
starting
up
with
a
smile
of
pleased
recognition
for
there
had
been
no
abundance
of
kind
acts
to
efface
the
recollection
of
bob
generosity
i
so
glad
to
see
you
thank
you
miss
said
bob
lifting
his
cap
and
showing
a
delighted
face
but
immediately
relieving
himself
of
some
accompanying
embarrassment
by
looking
down
at
his
dog
and
saying
in
a
tone
of
disgust
get
out
wi
you
you
thunderin
sawney
my
brother
is
not
at
home
yet
bob
said
maggie
he
is
always
at
ogg
in
the
daytime
well
miss
said
bob
i
should
be
glad
to
see
tom
but
that
is
just
what
i
come
for
look
here
bob
was
in
the
act
of
depositing
his
pack
on
the
and
with
it
a
row
of
small
books
fastened
together
with
string
apparently
however
they
were
not
the
object
to
which
he
wished
to
call
maggie
attention
but
rather
something
which
he
had
carried
under
his
arm
wrapped
in
a
red
handkerchief
see
here
he
said
again
laying
the
red
parcel
on
the
others
and
unfolding
it
you
wo
think
i
too
free
miss
i
hope
but
i
lighted
on
these
books
and
i
thought
they
might
make
up
to
you
a
bit
for
them
as
you
lost
for
i
heared
you
speak
o
picturs
as
for
picturs
here
the
opening
of
the
red
handkerchief
had
disclosed
a
superannuated
keepsake
and
six
or
seven
numbers
of
a
portrait
gallery
in
royal
octavo
and
the
emphatic
request
to
look
referred
to
a
portrait
of
george
the
fourth
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
depressed
cranium
and
voluminous
neckcloth
there
all
sorts
o
genelmen
here
bob
went
on
turning
over
the
leaves
with
some
excitement
wi
all
sorts
o
nones
an
some
bald
an
some
wi
wigs
parlament
genelmen
i
reckon
an
here
he
added
opening
the
keepsake
ladies
for
you
some
wi
curly
hair
and
some
wi
smooth
an
some
wi
their
heads
o
one
side
an
some
as
if
they
were
goin
to
cry
look
here
on
the
ground
out
o
door
dressed
like
the
ladies
seen
get
out
o
the
carriages
at
the
balls
in
th
old
hall
there
my
eyes
i
wonder
what
the
chaps
wear
as
go
i
sot
up
till
the
clock
was
gone
twelve
last
night
at
i
did
till
they
stared
at
me
out
o
the
picturs
as
if
they
know
when
i
spoke
to
but
lors
i
should
know
what
to
say
to
they
be
more
fittin
company
for
you
miss
and
the
man
at
the
he
said
they
banged
iverything
for
picturs
he
said
they
was
a
article
and
you
bought
them
for
me
bob
said
maggie
deeply
touched
by
this
simple
kindness
how
very
very
good
of
you
but
i
afraid
you
gave
a
great
deal
of
money
for
them
not
me
said
bob
i
ha
gev
three
times
the
money
if
they
make
up
to
you
a
bit
for
them
as
was
sold
away
from
you
miss
for
niver
forgot
how
you
looked
when
you
fretted
about
the
books
gone
it
stuck
by
me
as
if
it
was
a
pictur
hingin
before
me
when
i
see
the
book
open
upo
the
stall
wi
the
lady
lookin
out
of
it
wi
eyes
a
bit
like
when

my
takin
the
liberty
miss
i
thought
i
make
free
to
buy
it
for
you
an
then
i
bought
the
books
full
o
genelmen
to
match
an
then
here
bob
took
up
the
small
stringed
packet
of
books
i
thought

bit
more
print
as
well
as
the
picturs
an
i
got
these
for
a
sayso
they
o

maggie
i
very
thankful
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
and
being
so
good
to
me
and
tom
i

me
before
i
have
many
friends
who
care
for
me
hev
a
dog
miss
they
better
friends
nor
any
christian
said
bob
laying
down
his
pack
again
which
he
had
taken
up
with
the
intention
of
hurrying
away
for
he
felt
considerable
shyness
in
talking
to
a
young
lass
like
maggie
though
as
he
usually
said
of
himself
his
tongue
overrun
him
when
he
began
to
speak
i
give
you
mumps
he
break
his
heart
to
go
away
from
me
eh
mumps
what
do
you
say
you
mumps
declined
to
express
himself
more
diffusely
than
by
a
single
affirmative
movement
of
his
tail
but
i
get
you
a
pup
miss
an
welcome
no
thank
you
bob
we
have
a
yard
dog
and
i
may
keep
a
dog
of
my
own
eh
that
a
pity
else
there
a
pup
if
you
did
mind
about
it
not
being
thoroughbred
its
mother
acts
in
the
punch
show
an
uncommon
sensible
bitch
she
means
more
sense
wi
her
bark
nor
half
the
chaps
can
put
into
their
talk
from
breakfast
to
sundown
one
chap
carries
pots
a
poor
low
trade
as
any
on
the
road
he
says
toby
nought
but
a
mongrel
there
nought
to
look
at
in
her
but
i
says
to
him
what
are
you
yoursen
but
a
mongrel
there
was
much
pickin
o
feyther
an
mother
to
look
at
you
not
but
i
like
a
bit
o
breed
myself
but
i
ca
abide
to
see
one
cur
grinnin
at
another
i
wish
you
good
evenin
miss
said
bob
abruptly
taking
up
his
pack
again
under
the
consciousness
that
his
tongue
was
acting
in
an
undisciplined
manner
wo
you
come
in
the
evening
some
time
and
see
my
brother
bob
said
maggie
yes
miss
thank
you
another
time
you
give
my
duty
to
him
if
you
please
eh
he
a
fine
growed
chap
tom
is
he
took
to
growin
i
the
legs
an
did
the
pack
was
down
again
now
the
hook
of
the
stick
having
somehow
gone
wrong
you
do
call
mumps
a
cur
i
suppose
said
maggie
divining
that
any
interest
she
showed
in
mumps
would
be
gratifying
to
his
master
no
miss
a
fine
way
off
that
said
bob
with
pitying
smile
mumps
is
as
fine
a
cross
as
you
see
anywhere
along
the
floss
an
been
up
it
wi
the
barge
times
enow
why
the
gentry
stops
to
look
at
him
but
you
wo
catch
mumps
at
the
gentry
much
he
minds
his
own
business
he
does
the
expression
of
mump
face
which
seemed
to
be
tolerating
the
superfluous
existence
of
objects
in
general
was
strongly
confirmatory
of
this
high
praise
he
looks
dreadfully
surly
said
maggie
would
he
let
me
pat
him
ay
that
would
he
and
thank
you
he
knows
his
company
mumps
does
he
is
a
dog
as
be
caught
wi
gingerbread
he
smell
a
thief
a
good
deal
stronger
nor
the
gingerbread
he
would
lors
i
talk
to
him
by
th
hour
together
when
i
walking
i
lone
places
and
if
done
a
bit
o
mischief
i
allays
tell
him
got
no
secrets
but
what
mumps
knows
he
knows
about
my
big
thumb
he
does
your
big
thumb
what
that
bob
said
maggie
that
what
it
is
miss
said
bob
quickly
exhibiting
a
singularly
broad
specimen
of
that
difference
between
the
man
and
the
monkey
it
tells
i
measuring
out
the
flannel
you
see
i
carry
flannel
it
light
for
my
pack
an
it
dear
stuff
you
see
so
a
big
thumb
tells
i
clap
my
thumb
at
the
end
o
the
yard
and
cut
o
the
hither
side
of
it
and
the
old
women
are
up
but
bob
said
maggie
looking
serious
that
cheating
i
like
to
hear
you
say
that
do
you
miss
said
bob
regretfully
then
i
sorry
i
said
it
but
i
so
used
to
talking
to
mumps
an
he
does
mind
a
bit
cheating
when
it
them
skinflint
women
as
haggle
an
haggle
like
to
get
their
flannel
for
nothing
an
niver
ask
theirselves
how
i
got
my
dinner
out
o
i
niver
cheat
anybody
as
does
want
to
cheat
me
miss
lors
i
a
honest
chap
i
am
only
i
must
hev
a
bit
o
sport
an
now
i
do
go
wi
th
ferrets
got
no
varmint
to
come
over
but
them
haggling
women
i
wish
you
good
evening
miss
bob
thank
you
very
much
for
bringing
me
the
books
and
come
again
to
see
tom
yes
miss
said
bob
moving
on
a
few
steps
then
turning
half
round
he
said
i
leave
off
that
trick
wi
my
big
thumb
if
you
think
well
on
me
for
it
miss
but
it
be
a
pity
it
would
i
could
find
another
trick
so
good
an
what
be
the
use
havin
a
big
thumb
it
might
as
well
ha
been
narrow
maggie
thus
exalted
into
bob
exalting
madonna
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
at
which
her
worshipper
blue
eyes
twinkled
too
and
under
these
favoring
auspices
he
touched
his
cap
and
walked
away
the
days
of
chivalry
are
not
gone
notwithstanding
burke
grand
dirge
over
them
they
live
still
in
that
worship
paid
by
many
a
youth
and
man
to
the
woman
of
whom
he
never
dreams
that
he
shall
touch
so
much
as
her
little
finger
or
the
hem
of
her
robe
bob
with
the
pack
on
his
back
had
as
respectful
an
adoration
for
this
maiden
as
if
he
had
been
a
knight
in
armor
calling
aloud
on
her
name
as
he
pricked
on
to
the
fight
that
gleam
of
merriment
soon
died
away
from
maggie
face
and
perhaps
only
made
the
returning
gloom
deeper
by
contrast
she
was
too
dispirited
even
to
like
answering
questions
about
bob
present
of
books
and
she
carried
them
away
to
her
bedroom
laying
them
down
there
and
seating
herself
on
her
one
stool
without
caring
to
look
at
them
just
yet
she
leaned
her
cheek
against
the
and
thought
that
the
bob
had
a
lot
much
happier
than
hers
maggie
sense
of
loneliness
and
utter
privation
of
joy
had
deepened
with
the
brightness
of
advancing
spring
all
the
favorite
outdoor
nooks
about
home
which
seemed
to
have
done
their
part
with
her
parents
in
nurturing
and
cherishing
her
were
now
mixed
up
with
the
and
gathered
no
smile
from
the
sunshine
every
affection
every
delight
the
poor
child
had
had
was
like
an
aching
nerve
to
her
there
was
no
music
for
her
any
more
no
piano
no
harmonized
voices
no
delicious
stringed
instruments
with
their
passionate
cries
of
imprisoned
spirits
sending
a
strange
vibration
through
her
frame
and
of
all
her
there
was
nothing
left
her
now
but
her
little
collection
of
which
she
turned
over
with
a
sickening
sense
that
she
knew
them
all
and
they
were
all
barren
of
comfort
even
at
school
she
had
often
wished
for
books
with
in
them
everything
she
learned
there
seemed
like
the
ends
of
long
threads
that
snapped
immediately
and
now
without
the
indirect
charm
of
télémaque
was
mere
bran
so
were
the
hard
dry
questions
on
christian
doctrine
there
was
no
flavor
in
them
no
strength
sometimes
maggie
thought
she
could
have
been
contented
with
absorbing
fancies
if
she
could
have
had
all
scott
novels
and
all
byron
poems
then
perhaps
she
might
have
found
happiness
enough
to
dull
her
sensibility
to
her
actual
daily
life
and
yet
they
were
hardly
what
she
wanted
she
could
make
of
her
own
but
no
would
satisfy
her
now
she
wanted
some
explanation
of
this
hard
real
life
the
father
seated
at
the
dull
the
childish
bewildered
mother
the
little
sordid
tasks
that
filled
the
hours
or
the
more
oppressive
emptiness
of
weary
joyless
leisure
the
need
of
some
tender
demonstrative
love
the
cruel
sense
that
tom
did
mind
what
she
thought
or
felt
and
that
they
were
no
longer
playfellows
together
the
privation
of
all
pleasant
things
that
had
come
to
more
than
to
others
she
wanted
some
key
that
would
enable
her
to
understand
and
in
understanding
to
endure
the
heavy
weight
that
had
fallen
on
her
young
heart
if
she
had
been
taught
real
learning
and
wisdom
such
as
great
men
knew
she
thought
she
should
have
held
the
secrets
of
life
if
she
had
only
books
that
she
might
learn
for
herself
what
wise
men
knew
saints
and
martyrs
had
never
interested
maggie
so
much
as
sages
and
poets
she
knew
little
of
saints
and
martyrs
and
had
gathered
as
a
general
result
of
her
teaching
that
they
were
a
temporary
provision
against
the
spread
of
catholicism
and
had
all
died
at
smithfield
in
one
of
these
meditations
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
forgotten
tom
which
had
been
sent
home
in
his
trunk
but
she
found
the
stock
unaccountably
shrunk
down
to
the
few
old
ones
which
had
been
well
thumbed
the
latin
dictionary
and
grammar
a
delectus
a
torn
eutropius
the
virgil
aldrich
logic
and
the
exasperating
euclid
still
latin
euclid
and
logic
would
surely
be
a
considerable
step
in
masculine
wisdom
in
that
knowledge
which
made
men
contented
and
even
glad
to
live
not
that
the
yearning
for
effectual
wisdom
was
quite
unmixed
a
certain
mirage
would
now
and
then
rise
on
the
desert
of
the
future
in
which
she
seemed
to
see
herself
honored
for
her
surprising
attainments
and
so
the
poor
child
with
her
soul
hunger
and
her
illusions
of
began
to
nibble
at
this
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
filling
her
vacant
hours
with
latin
geometry
and
the
forms
of
the
syllogism
and
feeling
a
gleam
of
triumph
now
and
then
that
her
understanding
was
quite
equal
to
these
peculiarly
masculine
studies
for
a
week
or
two
she
went
on
resolutely
enough
though
with
an
occasional
sinking
of
heart
as
if
she
had
set
out
toward
the
promised
land
alone
and
found
it
a
thirsty
trackless
uncertain
journey
in
the
severity
of
her
early
resolution
she
would
take
aldrich
out
into
the
fields
and
then
look
off
her
book
toward
the
sky
where
the
lark
was
twinkling
or
to
the
reeds
and
bushes
by
the
river
from
which
the
waterfowl
rustled
forth
on
its
anxious
awkward
flight
with
a
startled
sense
that
the
relation
between
aldrich
and
this
living
world
was
extremely
remote
for
her
the
discouragement
deepened
as
the
days
went
on
and
the
eager
heart
gained
faster
and
faster
on
the
patient
mind
somehow
when
she
sat
at
the
window
with
her
book
her
eyes
fix
themselves
blankly
on
the
outdoor
sunshine
then
they
would
fill
with
tears
and
sometimes
if
her
mother
was
not
in
the
room
the
studies
would
all
end
in
sobbing
she
rebelled
against
her
lot
she
fainted
under
its
loneliness
and
fits
even
of
anger
and
hatred
toward
her
father
and
mother
who
were
so
unlike
what
she
would
have
them
to
be
toward
tom
who
checked
her
and
met
her
thought
or
feeling
always
by
some
thwarting
difference
would
flow
out
over
her
affections
and
conscience
like
a
lava
stream
and
frighten
her
with
a
sense
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
her
to
become
a
demon
then
her
brain
would
be
busy
with
wild
romances
of
a
flight
from
home
in
search
of
something
less
sordid
and
dreary
she
would
go
to
some
great
man
walter
scott
perhaps
and
tell
him
how
wretched
and
how
clever
she
was
and
he
would
surely
do
something
for
her
but
in
the
middle
of
her
vision
her
father
would
perhaps
enter
the
room
for
the
evening
and
surprised
that
she
sat
still
without
noticing
him
would
say
complainingly
come
am
i
to
fetch
my
slippers
myself
the
voice
pierced
through
maggie
like
a
sword
there
was
another
sadness
besides
her
own
and
she
had
been
thinking
of
turning
her
back
on
it
and
forsaking
it
this
afternoon
the
sight
of
bob
cheerful
freckled
face
had
given
her
discontent
a
new
direction
she
thought
it
was
part
of
the
hardship
of
her
life
that
there
was
laid
upon
her
the
burthen
of
larger
wants
than
others
seemed
to
feel
that
she
had
to
endure
this
wide
hopeless
yearning
for
that
something
whatever
it
was
that
was
greatest
and
best
on
this
earth
she
wished
she
could
have
been
like
bob
with
his
easily
satisfied
ignorance
or
like
tom
who
had
something
to
do
on
which
he
could
fix
his
mind
with
a
steady
purpose
and
disregard
everything
else
poor
child
as
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
with
her
hands
clasped
tighter
and
tighter
and
her
foot
beating
the
ground
she
was
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
she
had
been
the
only
girl
in
the
civilized
world
of
that
day
who
had
come
out
of
her
with
a
soul
untrained
for
inevitable
struggles
with
no
other
part
of
her
inherited
share
in
the
treasures
of
thought
which
generations
of
painful
toil
have
laid
up
for
the
race
of
men
than
shreds
and
patches
of
feeble
literature
and
false
history
with
much
futile
information
about
saxon
and
other
kings
of
doubtful
example
but
unhappily
quite
without
that
knowledge
of
the
irreversible
laws
within
and
without
her
which
governing
the
habits
becomes
morality
and
developing
the
feelings
of
submission
and
dependence
becomes
religion
as
lonely
in
her
trouble
as
if
every
other
girl
besides
herself
had
been
cherished
and
watched
over
by
elder
minds
not
forgetful
of
their
own
early
time
when
need
was
keen
and
impulse
strong
at
last
maggie
eyes
glanced
down
on
the
books
that
lay
on
the
and
she
half
forsook
her
reverie
to
turn
over
listlessly
the
leaves
of
the
portrait
gallery
but
she
soon
pushed
this
aside
to
examine
the
little
row
of
books
tied
together
with
string
beauties
of
the
spectator
rasselas
economy
of
human
life
gregory
letters
she
knew
the
sort
of
matter
that
was
inside
all
these
the
christian
year
that
seemed
to
be
a
hymnbook
and
she
laid
it
down
again
but
à
kempis
the
name
had
come
across
her
in
her
reading
and
she
felt
the
satisfaction
which
every
one
knows
of
getting
some
ideas
to
attach
to
a
name
that
strays
solitary
in
the
memory
she
took
up
the
little
old
clumsy
book
with
some
curiosity
it
had
the
corners
turned
down
in
many
places
and
some
hand
now
forever
quiet
had
made
at
certain
passages
strong
marks
long
since
browned
by
time
maggie
turned
from
leaf
to
leaf
and
read
where
the
quiet
hand
pointed
know
that
the
love
of
thyself
doth
hurt
thee
more
than
anything
in
the
world
if
thou
seekest
this
or
that
and
wouldst
be
here
or
there
to
enjoy
thy
own
will
and
pleasure
thou
shalt
never
be
quiet
nor
free
from
care
for
in
everything
somewhat
will
be
wanting
and
in
every
place
there
will
be
some
that
will
cross
thee
both
above
and
below
which
way
soever
thou
dost
turn
thee
everywhere
thou
shalt
find
the
cross
and
everywhere
of
necessity
thou
must
have
patience
if
thou
wilt
have
inward
peace
and
enjoy
an
everlasting
crown
if
thou
desirest
to
mount
unto
this
height
thou
must
set
out
courageously
and
lay
the
axe
to
the
root
that
thou
mayest
pluck
up
and
destroy
that
hidden
inordinate
inclination
to
thyself
and
unto
all
private
and
earthly
good
on
this
sin
that
a
man
inordinately
loveth
himself
almost
all
dependeth
whatsoever
is
thoroughly
to
be
overcome
which
evil
being
once
overcome
and
subdued
there
will
presently
ensue
great
peace
and
tranquillity
it
is
but
little
thou
sufferest
in
comparison
of
them
that
have
suffered
so
much
were
so
strongly
tempted
so
grievously
afflicted
so
many
ways
tried
and
exercised
thou
oughtest
therefore
to
call
to
mind
the
more
heavy
sufferings
of
others
that
thou
mayest
the
easier
bear
thy
little
adversities
and
if
they
seem
not
little
unto
thee
beware
lest
thy
impatience
be
the
cause
thereof
blessed
are
those
ears
that
receive
the
whispers
of
the
divine
voice
and
listen
not
to
the
whisperings
of
the
world
blessed
are
those
ears
which
hearken
not
unto
the
voice
which
soundeth
outwardly
but
unto
the
truth
which
teacheth
inwardly
a
strange
thrill
of
awe
passed
through
maggie
while
she
read
as
if
she
had
been
wakened
in
the
night
by
a
strain
of
solemn
music
telling
of
beings
whose
souls
had
been
astir
while
hers
was
in
stupor
she
went
on
from
one
brown
mark
to
another
where
the
quiet
hand
seemed
to
point
hardly
conscious
that
she
was
reading
seeming
rather
to
listen
while
a
low
voice
said
why
dost
thou
here
gaze
about
since
this
is
not
the
place
of
thy
rest
in
heaven
ought
to
be
thy
dwelling
and
all
earthly
things
are
to
be
looked
on
as
they
forward
thy
journey
thither
all
things
pass
away
and
thou
together
with
them
beware
thou
cleavest
not
unto
them
lest
thou
be
entangled
and
perish
if
a
man
should
give
all
his
substance
yet
it
is
as
nothing
and
if
he
should
do
great
penances
yet
are
they
but
little
and
if
he
should
attain
to
all
knowledge
he
is
yet
far
off
and
if
he
should
be
of
great
virtue
and
very
fervent
devotion
yet
is
there
much
wanting
to
wit
one
thing
which
is
most
necessary
for
him
what
is
that
that
having
left
all
he
leave
himself
and
go
wholly
out
of
himself
and
retain
nothing
of
i
have
often
said
unto
thee
and
now
again
i
say
the
same
forsake
thyself
resign
thyself
and
thou
shalt
enjoy
much
inward
peace
then
shall
all
vain
imaginations
evil
perturbations
and
superfluous
cares
fly
away
then
shall
immoderate
fear
leave
thee
and
inordinate
love
shall
die
maggie
drew
a
long
breath
and
pushed
her
heavy
hair
back
as
if
to
see
a
sudden
vision
more
clearly
here
then
was
a
secret
of
life
that
would
enable
her
to
renounce
all
other
secrets
here
was
a
sublime
height
to
be
reached
without
the
help
of
outward
things
here
was
insight
and
strength
and
conquest
to
be
won
by
means
entirely
within
her
own
soul
where
a
supreme
teacher
was
waiting
to
be
heard
it
flashed
through
her
like
the
suddenly
apprehended
solution
of
a
problem
that
all
the
miseries
of
her
young
life
had
come
from
fixing
her
heart
on
her
own
pleasure
as
if
that
were
the
central
necessity
of
the
universe
and
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
possibility
of
shifting
the
position
from
which
she
looked
at
the
gratification
of
her
own
desires
of
taking
her
stand
out
of
herself
and
looking
at
her
own
life
as
an
insignificant
part
of
a
divinely
guided
whole
she
read
on
and
on
in
the
old
book
devouring
eagerly
the
dialogues
with
the
invisible
teacher
the
pattern
of
sorrow
the
source
of
all
strength
returning
to
it
after
she
had
been
called
away
and
reading
till
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
willows
with
all
the
hurry
of
an
imagination
that
could
never
rest
in
the
present
she
sat
in
the
deepening
twilight
forming
plans
of
and
entire
devotedness
and
in
the
ardor
of
first
discovery
renunciation
seemed
to
her
the
entrance
into
that
satisfaction
which
she
had
so
long
been
craving
in
vain
she
had
not
perceived
how
could
she
until
she
had
lived
longer
the
inmost
truth
of
the
old
monk
that
renunciation
remains
sorrow
though
a
sorrow
borne
willingly
maggie
was
still
panting
for
happiness
and
was
in
ecstasy
because
she
had
found
the
key
to
it
she
knew
nothing
of
doctrines
and
systems
of
mysticism
or
quietism
but
this
voice
out
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
direct
communication
of
a
human
soul
belief
and
experience
and
came
to
maggie
as
an
unquestioned
message
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
the
small
book
for
which
you
need
only
pay
sixpence
at
a
works
miracles
to
this
day
turning
bitter
waters
into
sweetness
while
expensive
sermons
and
treatises
newly
issued
leave
all
things
as
they
were
before
it
was
written
down
by
a
hand
that
waited
for
the
prompting
it
is
the
chronicle
of
a
solitary
hidden
anguish
struggle
trust
and
triumph
not
written
on
velvet
cushions
to
teach
endurance
to
those
who
are
treading
with
bleeding
feet
on
the
stones
and
so
it
remains
to
all
time
a
lasting
record
of
human
needs
and
human
consolations
the
voice
of
a
brother
who
ages
ago
felt
and
suffered
and
renounced
in
the
cloister
perhaps
with
serge
gown
and
tonsured
head
with
much
chanting
and
long
fasts
and
with
a
fashion
of
speech
different
from
ours
but
under
the
same
silent
heavens
and
with
the
same
passionate
desires
the
same
strivings
the
same
failures
the
same
weariness
in
writing
the
history
of
unfashionable
families
one
is
apt
to
fall
into
a
tone
of
emphasis
which
is
very
far
from
being
the
tone
of
good
society
where
principles
and
beliefs
are
not
only
of
an
extremely
moderate
kind
but
are
always
presupposed
no
subjects
being
eligible
but
such
as
can
be
touched
with
a
light
and
graceful
irony
but
then
good
society
has
its
claret
and
its
velvet
carpets
its
six
weeks
deep
its
opera
and
its
faëry
rides
off
its
on
thoroughbred
horses
lounges
at
the
club
has
to
keep
clear
of
crinoline
vortices
gets
its
science
done
by
faraday
and
its
religion
by
the
superior
clergy
who
are
to
be
met
in
the
best
houses
how
should
it
have
time
or
need
for
belief
and
emphasis
but
good
society
floated
on
gossamer
wings
of
light
irony
is
of
very
expensive
production
requiring
nothing
less
than
a
wide
and
arduous
national
life
condensed
in
unfragrant
deafening
factories
cramping
itself
in
mines
sweating
at
furnaces
grinding
hammering
weaving
under
more
or
less
oppression
of
carbonic
acid
or
else
spread
over
sheepwalks
and
scattered
in
lonely
houses
and
huts
on
the
clayey
or
chalky
where
the
rainy
days
look
dreary
this
wide
national
life
is
based
entirely
on
emphasis
the
emphasis
of
want
which
urges
it
into
all
the
activities
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
good
society
and
light
irony
it
spends
its
heavy
years
often
in
a
chill
uncarpeted
fashion
amidst
family
discord
unsoftened
by
long
corridors
under
such
circumstances
there
are
many
among
its
myriads
of
souls
who
have
absolutely
needed
an
emphatic
belief
life
in
this
unpleasurable
shape
demanding
some
solution
even
to
unspeculative
minds
just
as
you
inquire
into
the
stuffing
of
your
couch
when
anything
galls
you
there
whereas
and
perfect
french
springs
excite
no
question
some
have
an
emphatic
belief
in
alcohol
and
seek
their
or
outside
in
gin
but
the
rest
require
something
that
good
society
calls
enthusiasm
something
that
will
present
motives
in
an
entire
absence
of
high
prizes
something
that
will
give
patience
and
feed
human
love
when
the
limbs
ache
with
weariness
and
human
looks
are
hard
upon
us
something
clearly
that
lies
outside
personal
desires
that
includes
resignation
for
ourselves
and
active
love
for
what
is
not
ourselves
now
and
then
that
sort
of
enthusiasm
finds
a
voice
that
comes
from
an
experience
springing
out
of
the
deepest
need
and
it
was
by
being
brought
within
the
long
lingering
vibrations
of
such
a
voice
that
maggie
with
her
girl
face
and
unnoted
sorrows
found
an
effort
and
a
hope
that
helped
her
through
years
of
loneliness
making
out
a
faith
for
herself
without
the
aid
of
established
authorities
and
appointed
guides
for
they
were
not
at
hand
and
her
need
was
pressing
from
what
you
know
of
her
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
she
threw
some
exaggeration
and
wilfulness
some
pride
and
impetuosity
even
into
her
her
own
life
was
still
a
drama
for
her
in
which
she
demanded
of
herself
that
her
part
should
be
played
with
intensity
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
she
often
lost
the
spirit
of
humility
by
being
excessive
in
the
outward
act
she
often
strove
after
too
high
a
flight
and
came
down
with
her
poor
little
wings
dabbled
in
the
mud
for
example
she
not
only
determined
to
work
at
plain
sewing
that
she
might
contribute
something
toward
the
fund
in
the
tin
box
but
she
went
in
the
first
instance
in
her
zeal
of
to
ask
for
it
at
a
linen
shop
in
ogg
instead
of
getting
it
in
a
more
quiet
and
indirect
way
and
could
see
nothing
but
what
was
entirely
wrong
and
unkind
nay
persecuting
in
tom
reproof
of
her
for
this
unnecessary
act
i
do
like
sister
to
do
such
things
said
tom
take
care
that
the
debts
are
paid
without
your
lowering
yourself
in
that
way
surely
there
was
some
tenderness
and
bravery
mingled
with
the
worldliness
and
of
that
little
speech
but
maggie
held
it
as
dross
overlooking
the
grains
of
gold
and
took
tom
rebuke
as
one
of
her
outward
crosses
tom
was
very
hard
to
her
she
used
to
think
in
her
long
to
her
who
had
always
loved
him
so
and
then
she
strove
to
be
contented
with
that
hardness
and
to
require
nothing
that
is
the
path
we
all
like
when
we
set
out
on
our
abandonment
of
egoism
the
path
of
martyrdom
and
endurance
where
the
grow
rather
than
the
steep
highway
of
tolerance
just
allowance
and
where
there
are
no
leafy
honors
to
be
gathered
and
worn
the
old
books
virgil
euclid
and
aldrich
that
wrinkled
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
had
been
all
laid
by
for
maggie
had
turned
her
back
on
the
vain
ambition
to
share
the
thoughts
of
the
wise
in
her
first
ardor
she
flung
away
the
books
with
a
sort
of
triumph
that
she
had
risen
above
the
need
of
them
and
if
they
had
been
her
own
she
would
have
burned
them
believing
that
she
would
never
repent
she
read
so
eagerly
and
constantly
in
her
three
books
the
bible
thomas
à
kempis
and
the
christian
year
no
longer
rejected
as
a
that
they
filled
her
mind
with
a
continual
stream
of
rhythmic
memories
and
she
was
too
ardently
learning
to
see
all
nature
and
life
in
the
light
of
her
new
faith
to
need
any
other
material
for
her
mind
to
work
on
as
she
sat
with
her
needle
making
shirts
and
other
complicated
stitchings
falsely
called
plain
by
no
means
plain
to
maggie
since
wristband
and
sleeve
and
the
like
had
a
capability
of
being
sewed
in
wrong
side
outward
in
moments
of
mental
wandering
hanging
diligently
over
her
sewing
maggie
was
a
sight
any
one
might
have
been
pleased
to
look
at
that
new
inward
life
of
hers
notwithstanding
some
volcanic
upheavings
of
imprisoned
passions
yet
shone
out
in
her
face
with
a
tender
soft
light
that
mingled
itself
as
added
loveliness
with
the
gradually
enriched
color
and
outline
of
her
blossoming
youth
her
mother
felt
the
change
in
her
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
wonder
that
maggie
should
be
growing
up
so
good
it
was
amazing
that
this
once
contrairy
child
was
become
so
submissive
so
backward
to
assert
her
own
will
maggie
used
to
look
up
from
her
work
and
find
her
mother
eyes
fixed
upon
her
they
were
watching
and
waiting
for
the
large
young
glance
as
if
her
elder
frame
got
some
needful
warmth
from
it
the
mother
was
getting
fond
of
her
tall
brown
girl
the
only
bit
of
furniture
now
on
which
she
could
bestow
her
anxiety
and
pride
and
maggie
in
spite
of
her
own
ascetic
wish
to
have
no
personal
adornment
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
her
mother
about
her
hair
and
submit
to
have
the
abundant
black
locks
plaited
into
a
coronet
on
the
summit
of
her
head
after
the
pitiable
fashion
of
those
antiquated
times
let
your
mother
have
that
bit
o
pleasure
my
dear
said
tulliver
i
trouble
enough
with
your
hair
once
so
maggie
glad
of
anything
that
would
soothe
her
mother
and
cheer
their
long
day
together
consented
to
the
vain
decoration
and
showed
a
queenly
head
above
her
old
frocks
steadily
refusing
however
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
tulliver
liked
to
call
the
attention
to
maggie
hair
and
other
unexpected
virtues
but
he
had
a
brusk
reply
to
give
i
knew
well
enough
what
she
be
before
now
it
nothing
new
to
me
but
it
a
pity
she
is
made
o
commoner
stuff
she
be
thrown
away
i
doubt
there
be
nobody
to
marry
her
as
is
fit
for
her
and
maggie
graces
of
mind
and
body
fed
his
gloom
he
sat
patiently
enough
while
she
read
him
a
chapter
or
said
something
timidly
when
they
were
alone
together
about
trouble
being
turned
into
a
blessing
he
took
it
all
as
part
of
his
daughter
goodness
which
made
his
misfortunes
the
sadder
to
him
because
they
damaged
her
chance
in
life
in
a
mind
charged
with
an
eager
purpose
and
an
unsatisfied
vindictiveness
there
is
no
room
for
new
feelings
tulliver
did
not
want
spiritual
consolation
he
wanted
to
shake
off
the
degradation
of
debt
and
to
have
his
revenge
book
v
and
chapter
i
in
the
red
deeps
the
family
was
a
long
room
with
a
window
at
each
end
one
looking
toward
the
croft
and
along
the
ripple
to
the
banks
of
the
floss
the
other
into
the
maggie
was
sitting
with
her
work
against
the
latter
window
when
she
saw
wakem
entering
the
yard
as
usual
on
his
fine
black
horse
but
not
alone
as
usual
some
one
was
with
him
a
figure
in
a
cloak
on
a
handsome
pony
maggie
had
hardly
time
to
feel
that
it
was
philip
come
back
before
they
were
in
front
of
the
window
and
he
was
raising
his
hat
to
her
while
his
father
catching
the
movement
by
a
looked
sharply
round
at
them
both
maggie
hurried
away
from
the
window
and
carried
her
work
upstairs
for
wakem
sometimes
came
in
and
inspected
the
books
and
maggie
felt
that
the
meeting
with
philip
would
be
robbed
of
all
pleasure
in
the
presence
of
the
two
fathers
some
day
perhaps
she
could
see
him
when
they
could
just
shake
hands
and
she
could
tell
him
that
she
remembered
his
goodness
to
tom
and
the
things
he
had
said
to
her
in
the
old
days
though
they
could
never
be
friends
any
more
it
was
not
at
all
agitating
to
maggie
to
see
philip
again
she
retained
her
childish
gratitude
and
pity
toward
him
and
remembered
his
cleverness
and
in
the
early
weeks
of
her
loneliness
she
had
continually
recalled
the
image
of
him
among
the
people
who
had
been
kind
to
her
in
life
often
wishing
she
had
him
for
a
brother
and
a
teacher
as
they
had
fancied
it
might
have
been
in
their
talk
together
but
that
sort
of
wishing
had
been
banished
along
with
other
dreams
that
savored
of
seeking
her
own
will
and
she
thought
besides
that
philip
might
be
altered
by
his
life
abroad
he
might
have
become
worldly
and
really
not
care
about
her
saying
anything
to
him
now
and
yet
his
face
was
wonderfully
little
altered
it
was
only
a
larger
more
manly
copy
of
the
pale
boy
face
with
the
gray
eyes
and
the
boyish
waving
brown
hair
there
was
the
old
deformity
to
awaken
the
old
pity
and
after
all
her
meditations
maggie
felt
that
she
really
like
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
he
might
still
be
melancholy
as
he
always
used
to
be
and
like
her
to
look
at
him
kindly
she
wondered
if
he
remembered
how
he
used
to
like
her
eyes
with
that
thought
maggie
glanced
toward
the
square
which
was
condemned
to
hang
with
its
face
toward
the
wall
and
she
half
started
from
her
seat
to
reach
it
down
but
she
checked
herself
and
snatched
up
her
work
trying
to
repress
the
rising
wishes
by
forcing
her
memory
to
recall
snatches
of
hymns
until
she
saw
philip
and
his
father
returning
along
the
road
and
she
could
go
down
again
it
was
far
on
in
june
now
and
maggie
was
inclined
to
lengthen
the
daily
walk
which
was
her
one
indulgence
but
this
day
and
the
following
she
was
so
busy
with
work
which
must
be
finished
that
she
never
went
beyond
the
gate
and
satisfied
her
need
of
the
open
air
by
sitting
out
of
doors
one
of
her
frequent
walks
when
she
was
not
obliged
to
go
to
ogg
was
to
a
spot
that
lay
beyond
what
was
called
the
hill
an
insignificant
rise
of
ground
crowned
by
trees
lying
along
the
side
of
the
road
which
ran
by
the
gates
of
dorlcote
mill
insignificant
i
call
it
because
in
height
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
bank
but
there
may
come
moments
when
nature
makes
a
mere
bank
a
means
toward
a
fateful
result
and
that
is
why
i
ask
you
to
imagine
this
high
bank
crowned
with
trees
making
an
uneven
wall
for
some
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
left
side
of
dorlcote
mill
and
the
pleasant
fields
behind
it
bounded
by
the
murmuring
ripple
just
where
this
line
of
bank
sloped
down
again
to
the
level
a
turned
off
and
led
to
the
other
side
of
the
rise
where
it
was
broken
into
very
capricious
hollows
and
mounds
by
the
working
of
an
exhausted
so
long
exhausted
that
both
mounds
and
hollows
were
now
clothed
with
brambles
and
trees
and
here
and
there
by
a
stretch
of
grass
which
a
few
sheep
kept
in
her
childish
days
maggie
held
this
place
called
the
red
deeps
in
very
great
awe
and
needed
all
her
confidence
in
tom
bravery
to
reconcile
her
to
an
excursion
thither
visions
of
robbers
and
fierce
animals
haunting
every
hollow
but
now
it
had
the
charm
for
her
which
any
broken
ground
any
mimic
rock
and
ravine
have
for
the
eyes
that
rest
habitually
on
the
level
especially
in
summer
when
she
could
sit
on
a
grassy
hollow
under
the
shadow
of
a
branching
ash
stooping
aslant
from
the
steep
above
her
and
listen
to
the
hum
of
insects
like
tiniest
bells
on
the
garment
of
silence
or
see
the
sunlight
piercing
the
distant
boughs
as
if
to
chase
and
drive
home
the
truant
heavenly
blue
of
the
wild
hyacinths
in
this
june
time
too
the
were
in
their
glory
and
that
was
an
additional
reason
why
maggie
should
direct
her
walk
to
the
red
deeps
rather
than
to
any
other
spot
on
the
first
day
she
was
free
to
wander
at
her
will
a
pleasure
she
loved
so
well
that
sometimes
in
her
ardors
of
renunciation
she
thought
she
ought
to
deny
herself
the
frequent
indulgence
in
it
you
may
see
her
now
as
she
walks
down
the
favorite
turning
and
enters
the
deeps
by
a
narrow
path
through
a
group
of
scotch
firs
her
tall
figure
and
old
lavender
gown
visible
through
an
hereditary
black
silk
shawl
of
some
material
and
now
she
is
sure
of
being
unseen
she
takes
off
her
bonnet
and
ties
it
over
her
arm
one
would
certainly
suppose
her
to
be
farther
on
in
life
than
her
seventeenth
year
perhaps
because
of
the
slow
resigned
sadness
of
the
glance
from
which
all
search
and
unrest
seem
to
have
departed
perhaps
because
her
figure
has
the
mould
of
early
womanhood
youth
and
health
have
withstood
well
the
involuntary
and
voluntary
hardships
of
her
lot
and
the
nights
in
which
she
has
lain
on
the
hard
floor
for
a
penance
have
left
no
obvious
trace
the
eyes
are
liquid
the
brown
cheek
is
firm
and
round
the
full
lips
are
red
with
her
dark
coloring
and
jet
crown
surmounting
her
tall
figure
she
seems
to
have
a
sort
of
kinship
with
the
grand
scotch
firs
at
which
she
is
looking
up
as
if
she
loved
them
well
yet
one
has
a
sense
of
uneasiness
in
looking
at
her
a
sense
of
opposing
elements
of
which
a
fierce
collision
is
imminent
surely
there
is
a
hushed
expression
such
as
one
often
sees
in
older
faces
under
borderless
caps
out
of
keeping
with
the
resistant
youth
which
one
expects
to
flash
out
in
a
sudden
passionate
glance
that
will
dissipate
all
the
quietude
like
a
damp
fire
leaping
out
again
when
all
seemed
safe
but
maggie
herself
was
not
uneasy
at
this
moment
she
was
calmly
enjoying
the
free
air
while
she
looked
up
at
the
old
and
thought
that
those
broken
ends
of
branches
were
the
records
of
past
storms
which
had
only
made
the
red
stems
soar
higher
but
while
her
eyes
were
still
turned
upward
she
became
conscious
of
a
moving
shadow
cast
by
the
evening
sun
on
the
grassy
path
before
her
and
looked
down
with
a
startled
gesture
to
see
philip
wakem
who
first
raised
his
hat
and
then
blushing
deeply
came
forward
to
her
and
put
out
his
hand
maggie
too
colored
with
surprise
which
soon
gave
way
to
pleasure
she
put
out
her
hand
and
looked
down
at
the
deformed
figure
before
her
with
frank
eyes
filled
for
the
moment
with
nothing
but
the
memory
of
her
child
feelings
a
memory
that
was
always
strong
in
her
she
was
the
first
to
speak
you
startled
me
she
said
smiling
faintly
i
never
meet
any
one
here
how
came
you
to
be
walking
here
did
you
come
to
meet
it
was
impossible
not
to
perceive
that
maggie
felt
herself
a
child
again
yes
i
did
said
philip
still
embarrassed
i
wished
to
see
you
very
much
i
watched
a
long
while
yesterday
on
the
bank
near
your
house
to
see
if
you
would
come
out
but
you
never
came
then
i
watched
again
and
when
i
saw
the
way
you
took
i
kept
you
in
sight
and
came
down
the
bank
behind
there
i
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
me
no
said
maggie
with
simple
seriousness
walking
on
as
if
she
meant
philip
to
accompany
her
i
very
glad
you
came
for
i
wished
very
much
to
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
i
never
forgotten
how
good
you
were
long
ago
to
tom
and
me
too
but
i
was
not
sure
that
you
would
remember
us
so
well
tom
and
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
since
then
and
i
think
makes
one
think
more
of
what
happened
before
the
trouble
came
i
ca
believe
that
you
have
thought
of
me
so
much
as
i
have
thought
of
you
said
philip
timidly
do
you
know
when
i
was
away
i
made
a
picture
of
you
as
you
looked
that
morning
in
the
study
when
you
said
you
would
not
forget
me
philip
drew
a
large
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
maggie
saw
her
old
self
leaning
on
a
table
with
her
black
locks
hanging
down
behind
her
ears
looking
into
space
with
strange
dreamy
eyes
it
was
a
sketch
of
real
merit
as
a
portrait
oh
dear
said
maggie
smiling
and
flushed
with
pleasure
what
a
queer
little
girl
i
was
i
remember
myself
with
my
hair
in
that
way
in
that
pink
frock
i
really
like
a
gypsy
i
dare
say
i
am
now
she
added
after
a
little
pause
am
i
like
what
you
expected
me
to
be
the
words
might
have
been
those
of
a
coquette
but
the
full
bright
glance
maggie
turned
on
philip
was
not
that
of
a
coquette
she
really
did
hope
he
liked
her
face
as
it
was
now
but
it
was
simply
the
rising
again
of
her
innate
delight
in
admiration
and
love
philip
met
her
eyes
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
long
moment
before
he
said
quietly
no
maggie
the
light
died
out
a
little
from
maggie
face
and
there
was
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lip
her
eyelids
fell
lower
but
she
did
not
turn
away
her
head
and
philip
continued
to
look
at
her
then
he
said
slowly
you
are
very
much
more
beautiful
than
i
thought
you
would
be
am
i
said
maggie
the
pleasure
returning
in
a
deeper
flush
she
turned
her
face
away
from
him
and
took
some
steps
looking
straight
before
her
in
silence
as
if
she
were
adjusting
her
consciousness
to
this
new
idea
girls
are
so
accustomed
to
think
of
dress
as
the
main
ground
of
vanity
that
in
abstaining
from
the
maggie
had
thought
more
of
abandoning
all
care
for
adornment
than
of
renouncing
the
contemplation
of
her
face
comparing
herself
with
elegant
wealthy
young
ladies
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
produce
any
effect
with
her
person
philip
seemed
to
like
the
silence
well
he
walked
by
her
side
watching
her
face
as
if
that
sight
left
no
room
for
any
other
wish
they
had
passed
from
among
the
and
had
now
come
to
a
green
hollow
almost
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
the
pale
pink
but
as
the
light
about
them
had
brightened
maggie
face
had
lost
its
glow
she
stood
still
when
they
were
in
the
hollows
and
looking
at
philip
again
she
said
in
a
serious
sad
voice
i
wish
we
could
have
been
friends
i
mean
if
it
would
have
been
good
and
right
for
us
but
that
is
the
trial
i
have
to
bear
in
everything
i
may
not
keep
anything
i
used
to
love
when
i
was
little
the
old
books
went
and
tom
is
different
and
my
father
it
is
like
death
i
must
part
with
everything
i
cared
for
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
must
part
with
you
we
must
never
take
any
notice
of
each
other
again
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
for
i
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
tom
and
i
ca
do
as
we
like
about
such
things
and
that
if
i
behave
as
if
i
had
forgotten
all
about
you
it
is
not
out
of
envy
or
pride
or
or
any
bad
feeling
maggie
spoke
with
more
and
more
sorrowful
gentleness
as
she
went
on
and
her
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
the
deepening
expression
of
pain
on
philip
face
gave
him
a
stronger
resemblance
to
his
boyish
self
and
made
the
deformity
appeal
more
strongly
to
her
pity
i
know
i
see
all
that
you
mean
he
said
in
a
voice
that
had
become
feebler
from
discouragement
i
know
what
there
is
to
keep
us
apart
on
both
sides
but
it
is
not
right
maggie
do
you
be
angry
with
me
i
am
so
used
to
call
you
maggie
in
my
thoughts
it
is
not
right
to
sacrifice
everything
to
other
people
unreasonable
feelings
i
would
give
up
a
great
deal
for
father
but
i
would
not
give
up
a
friendship
or
or
an
attachment
of
any
sort
in
obedience
to
any
wish
of
his
that
i
did
recognize
as
right
i
do
know
said
maggie
musingly
often
when
i
have
been
angry
and
discontented
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
not
bound
to
give
up
anything
and
i
have
gone
on
thinking
till
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
think
away
all
my
duty
but
no
good
has
ever
come
of
that
it
was
an
evil
state
of
mind
i
quite
sure
that
whatever
i
might
do
i
should
wish
in
the
end
that
i
had
gone
without
anything
for
myself
rather
than
have
made
my
father
life
harder
to
him
but
would
it
make
his
life
harder
if
we
were
to
see
each
other
sometimes
said
philip
he
was
going
to
say
something
else
but
checked
himself
oh
i
sure
he
would
like
it
do
ask
me
why
or
anything
about
it
said
maggie
in
a
distressed
tone
my
father
feels
so
strongly
about
some
things
he
is
not
at
all
happy
no
more
am
i
said
philip
impetuously
i
am
not
happy
why
said
maggie
gently
at
least
i
ought
not
to
ask
but
very
very
sorry
philip
turned
to
walk
on
as
if
he
had
not
patience
to
stand
still
any
longer
and
they
went
out
of
the
hollow
winding
amongst
the
trees
and
bushes
in
silence
after
that
last
word
of
philip
maggie
could
not
bear
to
insist
immediately
on
their
parting
i
been
a
great
deal
happier
she
said
at
last
timidly
since
i
have
given
up
thinking
about
what
is
easy
and
pleasant
and
being
discontented
because
i
could
have
my
own
will
our
life
is
determined
for
us
and
it
makes
the
mind
very
free
when
we
give
up
wishing
and
only
think
of
bearing
what
is
laid
upon
us
and
doing
what
is
given
us
to
do
but
i
ca
give
up
wishing
said
philip
impatiently
it
seems
to
me
we
can
never
give
up
longing
and
wishing
while
we
are
thoroughly
alive
there
are
certain
things
we
feel
to
be
beautiful
and
good
and
we
hunger
after
them
how
can
we
ever
be
satisfied
without
them
until
our
feelings
are
deadened
i
delight
in
fine
pictures
i
long
to
be
able
to
paint
such
i
strive
and
strive
and
ca
produce
what
i
want
that
is
pain
to
me
and
always
be
pain
until
my
faculties
lose
their
keenness
like
aged
eyes
then
there
are
many
other
things
i
long
for
here
philip
hesitated
a
little
and
then
said
things
that
other
men
have
and
that
will
always
be
denied
me
my
life
will
have
nothing
great
or
beautiful
in
it
i
would
rather
not
have
lived
oh
philip
said
maggie
i
wish
you
did
feel
so
but
her
heart
began
to
beat
with
something
of
philip
discontent
well
then
said
he
turning
quickly
round
and
fixing
his
gray
eyes
entreatingly
on
her
face
i
should
be
contented
to
live
if
you
would
let
me
see
you
sometimes
then
checked
by
a
fear
which
her
face
suggested
he
looked
away
again
and
said
more
calmly
i
have
no
friend
to
whom
i
can
tell
everything
no
one
who
cares
enough
about
me
and
if
i
could
only
see
you
now
and
then
and
you
would
let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
and
show
me
that
you
cared
for
me
and
that
we
may
always
be
friends
in
heart
and
help
each
other
then
i
might
come
to
be
glad
of
life
but
how
can
i
see
you
philip
said
maggie
falteringly
could
she
really
do
him
good
it
would
be
very
hard
to
say
this
day
and
not
speak
to
him
again
here
was
a
new
interest
to
vary
the
days
it
was
so
much
easier
to
renounce
the
interest
before
it
came
if
you
would
let
me
see
you
here
sometimes
walk
with
you
here
i
would
be
contented
if
it
were
only
once
or
twice
in
a
month
could
injure
no
one
happiness
and
it
would
sweeten
my
life
besides
philip
went
on
with
all
the
inventive
astuteness
of
love
at
if
there
is
any
enmity
between
those
who
belong
to
us
we
ought
all
the
more
to
try
and
quench
it
by
our
friendship
i
mean
that
by
our
influence
on
both
sides
we
might
bring
about
a
healing
of
the
wounds
that
have
been
made
in
the
past
if
i
could
know
everything
about
them
and
i
do
believe
there
is
any
enmity
in
my
own
father
mind
i
think
he
has
proved
the
contrary
maggie
shook
her
head
slowly
and
was
silent
under
conflicting
thoughts
it
seemed
to
her
inclination
that
to
see
philip
now
and
then
and
keep
up
the
bond
of
friendship
with
him
was
something
not
only
innocent
but
good
perhaps
she
might
really
help
him
to
find
contentment
as
she
had
found
it
the
voice
that
said
this
made
sweet
music
to
maggie
but
athwart
it
there
came
an
urgent
monotonous
warning
from
another
voice
which
she
had
been
learning
to
obey
the
warning
that
such
interviews
implied
secrecy
implied
doing
something
she
would
dread
to
be
discovered
in
something
that
if
discovered
must
cause
anger
and
pain
and
that
the
admission
of
anything
so
near
doubleness
would
act
as
a
spiritual
blight
yet
the
music
would
swell
out
again
like
chimes
borne
onward
by
a
recurrent
breeze
persuading
her
that
the
wrong
lay
all
in
the
faults
and
weaknesses
of
others
and
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
futile
sacrifice
for
one
to
the
injury
of
another
it
was
very
cruel
for
philip
that
he
should
be
shrunk
from
because
of
an
unjustifiable
vindictiveness
toward
his
father
poor
philip
whom
some
people
would
shrink
from
only
because
he
was
deformed
the
idea
that
he
might
become
her
lover
or
that
her
meeting
him
could
cause
disapproval
in
that
light
had
not
occurred
to
her
and
philip
saw
the
absence
of
this
idea
clearly
enough
saw
it
with
a
certain
pang
although
it
made
her
consent
to
his
request
the
less
unlikely
there
was
bitterness
to
him
in
the
perception
that
maggie
was
almost
as
frank
and
unconstrained
toward
him
as
when
she
was
a
child
i
ca
say
either
yes
or
no
she
said
at
last
turning
round
and
walking
toward
the
way
she
come
i
must
wait
lest
i
should
decide
wrongly
i
must
seek
for
guidance
may
i
come
again
then
or
the
next
day
or
next
week
i
think
i
had
better
write
said
maggie
faltering
again
i
have
to
go
to
ogg
sometimes
and
i
can
put
the
letter
in
the
post
oh
no
said
philip
eagerly
that
would
not
be
so
well
my
father
might
see
the
letter
and
he
has
not
any
enmity
i
believe
but
he
views
things
differently
from
me
he
thinks
a
great
deal
about
wealth
and
position
pray
let
me
come
here
once
more
me
when
it
shall
be
or
if
you
ca
tell
me
i
will
come
as
often
as
i
can
till
i
do
see
you
i
think
it
must
be
so
then
said
maggie
for
i
ca
be
quite
certain
of
coming
here
any
particular
evening
maggie
felt
a
great
relief
in
adjourning
the
decision
she
was
free
now
to
enjoy
the
minutes
of
companionship
she
almost
thought
she
might
linger
a
little
the
next
time
they
met
she
should
have
to
pain
philip
by
telling
him
her
determination
i
ca
help
thinking
she
said
looking
smilingly
at
him
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
how
strange
it
is
that
we
should
have
met
and
talked
to
each
other
just
as
if
it
had
been
only
yesterday
when
we
parted
at
lorton
and
yet
we
must
both
be
very
much
altered
in
those
five
years
i
think
it
is
five
years
how
was
it
you
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
feeling
that
i
was
the
same
maggie
i
was
not
quite
so
sure
that
you
would
be
the
same
i
know
you
are
so
clever
and
you
must
have
seen
and
learnt
so
much
to
fill
your
mind
i
was
not
quite
sure
you
would
care
about
me
now
i
have
never
had
any
doubt
that
you
would
be
the
same
whenever
i
might
see
you
said
philip
i
mean
the
same
in
everything
that
made
me
like
you
better
than
any
one
else
i
do
want
to
explain
that
i
do
think
any
of
the
strongest
effects
our
natures
are
susceptible
of
can
ever
be
explained
we
can
neither
detect
the
process
by
which
they
are
arrived
at
nor
the
mode
in
which
they
act
on
us
the
greatest
of
painters
only
once
painted
a
mysteriously
divine
child
he
could
have
told
how
he
did
it
and
we
ca
tell
why
we
feel
it
to
be
divine
i
think
there
are
stores
laid
up
in
our
human
nature
that
our
understandings
can
make
no
complete
inventory
of
certain
strains
of
music
affect
me
so
strangely
i
can
never
hear
them
without
their
changing
my
whole
attitude
of
mind
for
a
time
and
if
the
effect
would
last
i
might
be
capable
of
heroisms
ah
i
know
what
you
mean
about
music
feel
so
said
maggie
clasping
her
hands
with
her
old
impetuosity
at
least
she
added
in
a
saddened
tone
i
used
to
feel
so
when
i
had
any
music
i
never
have
any
now
except
the
organ
at
church
and
you
long
for
it
maggie
said
philip
looking
at
her
with
affectionate
pity
ah
you
can
have
very
little
that
is
beautiful
in
your
life
have
you
many
books
you
were
so
fond
of
them
when
you
were
a
little
girl
they
were
come
back
to
the
hollow
round
which
the
grew
and
they
both
paused
under
the
charm
of
the
faëry
evening
light
reflected
from
the
pale
pink
clusters
no
i
have
given
up
books
said
maggie
quietly
except
a
very
very
few
philip
had
already
taken
from
his
pocket
a
small
volume
and
was
looking
at
the
back
as
he
said
ah
this
is
the
second
volume
i
see
else
you
might
have
liked
to
take
it
home
with
you
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
because
i
am
studying
a
scene
for
a
picture
maggie
had
looked
at
the
back
too
and
saw
the
title
it
revived
an
old
impression
with
overmastering
force
pirate
she
said
taking
the
book
from
philip
hands
oh
i
began
that
once
i
read
to
where
minna
is
walking
with
cleveland
and
i
could
never
get
to
read
the
rest
i
went
on
with
it
in
my
own
head
and
i
made
several
endings
but
they
were
all
unhappy
i
could
never
make
a
happy
ending
out
of
that
beginning
poor
minna
i
wonder
what
is
the
real
end
for
a
long
while
i
could
get
my
mind
away
from
the
shetland
isles
i
used
to
feel
the
wind
blowing
on
me
from
the
rough
sea
maggie
spoke
rapidly
with
glistening
eyes
take
that
volume
home
with
you
maggie
said
philip
watching
her
with
delight
i
do
want
it
now
i
shall
make
a
picture
of
you
instead
you
among
the
scotch
firs
and
the
slanting
shadows
maggie
had
not
heard
a
word
he
had
said
she
was
absorbed
in
a
page
at
which
she
had
opened
but
suddenly
she
closed
the
book
and
gave
it
back
to
philip
shaking
her
head
with
a
backward
movement
as
if
to
say
avaunt
to
floating
visions
do
keep
it
maggie
said
philip
entreatingly
it
will
give
you
pleasure
no
thank
you
said
maggie
putting
it
aside
with
her
hand
and
walking
on
it
would
make
me
in
love
with
this
world
again
as
i
used
to
be
it
would
make
me
long
to
see
and
know
many
things
it
would
make
me
long
for
a
full
life
but
you
will
not
always
be
shut
up
in
your
present
lot
why
should
you
starve
your
mind
in
that
way
it
is
narrow
asceticism
i
like
to
see
you
persisting
in
it
maggie
poetry
and
art
and
knowledge
are
sacred
and
pure
but
not
for
me
not
for
me
said
maggie
walking
more
hurriedly
because
i
should
want
too
much
i
must
wait
this
life
will
not
last
long
do
hurry
away
from
me
without
saying
maggie
said
philip
as
they
reached
the
group
of
scotch
firs
and
she
continued
still
to
walk
along
without
speaking
i
must
not
go
any
farther
i
think
must
i
oh
no
i
forgot
said
maggie
pausing
and
putting
out
her
hand
to
him
the
action
brought
her
feeling
back
in
a
strong
current
to
philip
and
after
they
had
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
with
their
hands
clasped
she
said
withdrawing
her
hand
i
very
grateful
to
you
for
thinking
of
me
all
those
years
it
is
very
sweet
to
have
people
love
us
what
a
wonderful
beautiful
thing
it
seems
that
god
should
have
made
your
heart
so
that
you
could
care
about
a
queer
little
girl
whom
you
only
knew
for
a
few
weeks
i
remember
saying
to
you
that
i
thought
you
cared
for
me
more
than
tom
did
ah
maggie
said
philip
almost
fretfully
you
would
never
love
me
so
well
as
you
love
your
brother
perhaps
not
said
maggie
simply
but
then
you
know
the
first
thing
i
ever
remember
in
my
life
is
standing
with
tom
by
the
side
of
the
floss
while
he
held
my
hand
everything
before
that
is
dark
to
me
but
i
shall
never
forget
you
though
we
must
keep
apart
do
say
so
maggie
said
philip
if
i
kept
that
little
girl
in
my
mind
for
five
years
did
i
earn
some
part
in
her
she
ought
not
to
take
herself
quite
away
from
me
not
if
i
were
free
said
maggie
but
i
am
not
i
must
submit
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
added
and
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
that
you
had
better
not
take
more
notice
of
my
brother
than
just
bowing
to
him
he
once
told
me
not
to
speak
to
you
again
and
he
does
change
his
mind
oh
dear
the
sun
is
set
i
am
too
long
away
she
gave
him
her
hand
once
more
i
shall
come
here
as
often
as
i
can
till
i
see
you
again
maggie
have
some
feeling
for
as
well
as
for
others
yes
yes
i
have
said
maggie
hurrying
away
and
quickly
disappearing
behind
the
last
though
philip
gaze
after
her
remained
immovable
for
minutes
as
if
he
saw
her
still
maggie
went
home
with
an
inward
conflict
already
begun
philip
went
home
to
do
nothing
but
remember
and
hope
you
can
hardly
help
blaming
him
severely
he
was
four
or
five
years
older
than
maggie
and
had
a
full
consciousness
of
his
feeling
toward
her
to
aid
him
in
foreseeing
the
character
his
contemplated
interviews
with
her
would
bear
in
the
opinion
of
a
third
person
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
he
was
capable
of
a
gross
selfishness
or
that
he
could
have
been
satisfied
without
persuading
himself
that
he
was
seeking
to
infuse
some
happiness
into
maggie
life
seeking
this
even
more
than
any
direct
ends
for
himself
he
could
give
her
sympathy
he
could
give
her
help
there
was
not
the
slightest
promise
of
love
toward
him
in
her
manner
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
sweet
girlish
tenderness
she
had
shown
him
when
she
was
twelve
perhaps
she
would
never
love
him
perhaps
no
woman
ever
love
him
well
then
he
would
endure
that
he
should
at
least
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
of
feeling
some
nearness
to
her
and
he
clutched
passionately
the
possibility
that
she
love
him
perhaps
the
feeling
would
grow
if
she
could
come
to
associate
him
with
that
watchful
tenderness
which
her
nature
would
be
so
keenly
alive
to
if
any
woman
could
love
him
surely
maggie
was
that
woman
there
was
such
wealth
of
love
in
her
and
there
was
no
one
to
claim
it
all
then
the
pity
of
it
that
a
mind
like
hers
should
be
withering
in
its
very
youth
like
a
young
for
want
of
the
light
and
space
it
was
formed
to
flourish
in
could
he
not
hinder
that
by
persuading
her
out
of
her
system
of
privation
he
would
be
her
guardian
angel
he
would
do
anything
bear
anything
for
her
sake
except
not
seeing
her
chapter
ii
aunt
glegg
learns
the
breadth
of
bob
thumb
while
maggie
had
lain
almost
entirely
within
her
own
soul
one
shadowy
army
fighting
another
and
the
slain
shadows
forever
rising
again
tom
was
engaged
in
a
dustier
noisier
warfare
grappling
with
more
substantial
obstacles
and
gaining
more
definite
conquests
so
it
has
been
since
the
days
of
hecuba
and
of
hector
tamer
of
horses
inside
the
gates
the
women
with
streaming
hair
and
uplifted
hands
offering
prayers
watching
the
world
combat
from
afar
filling
their
long
empty
days
with
memories
and
fears
outside
the
men
in
fierce
struggle
with
things
divine
and
human
quenching
memory
in
the
stronger
light
of
purpose
losing
the
sense
of
dread
and
even
of
wounds
in
the
hurrying
ardor
of
action
from
what
you
have
seen
of
tom
i
think
he
is
not
a
youth
of
whom
you
would
prophesy
failure
in
anything
he
had
thoroughly
wished
the
wagers
are
likely
to
be
on
his
side
notwithstanding
his
small
success
in
the
classics
for
tom
had
never
desired
success
in
this
field
of
enterprise
and
for
getting
a
fine
flourishing
growth
of
stupidity
there
is
nothing
like
pouring
out
on
a
mind
a
good
amount
of
subjects
in
which
it
feels
no
interest
but
now
tom
strong
will
bound
together
his
integrity
his
pride
his
family
regrets
and
his
personal
ambition
and
made
them
one
force
concentrating
his
efforts
and
surmounting
discouragements
his
uncle
deane
who
watched
him
closely
soon
began
to
conceive
hopes
of
him
and
to
be
rather
proud
that
he
had
brought
into
the
employment
of
the
firm
a
nephew
who
appeared
to
be
made
of
such
good
commercial
stuff
the
real
kindness
of
placing
him
in
the
warehouse
first
was
soon
evident
to
tom
in
the
hints
his
uncle
began
to
throw
out
that
after
a
time
he
might
perhaps
be
trusted
to
travel
at
certain
seasons
and
buy
in
for
the
firm
various
vulgar
commodities
with
which
i
need
not
shock
refined
ears
in
this
place
and
it
was
doubtless
with
a
view
to
this
result
that
deane
when
he
expected
to
take
his
wine
alone
would
tell
tom
to
step
in
and
sit
with
him
an
hour
and
would
pass
that
hour
in
much
lecturing
and
catechising
concerning
articles
of
export
and
import
with
an
occasional
excursus
of
more
indirect
utility
on
the
relative
advantages
to
the
merchants
of
ogg
of
having
goods
brought
in
their
own
and
in
foreign
bottoms
a
subject
on
which
deane
as
a
naturally
threw
off
a
few
sparks
when
he
got
warmed
with
talk
and
wine
already
in
the
second
year
tom
salary
was
raised
but
all
except
the
price
of
his
dinner
and
clothes
went
home
into
the
tin
box
and
he
shunned
comradeship
lest
it
should
lead
him
into
expenses
in
spite
of
himself
not
that
tom
was
moulded
on
the
spoony
type
of
the
industrious
apprentice
he
had
a
very
strong
appetite
for
pleasure
would
have
liked
to
be
a
tamer
of
horses
and
to
make
a
distinguished
figure
in
all
neighboring
eyes
dispensing
treats
and
benefits
to
others
with
liberality
and
being
pronounced
one
of
the
finest
young
fellows
of
those
parts
nay
he
determined
to
achieve
these
things
sooner
or
later
but
his
practical
shrewdness
told
him
that
the
means
no
such
achievements
could
only
lie
for
him
in
present
abstinence
and
there
were
certain
milestones
to
be
passed
and
one
of
the
first
was
the
payment
of
his
father
debts
having
made
up
his
mind
on
that
point
he
strode
along
without
swerving
contracting
some
rather
saturnine
sternness
as
a
young
man
is
likely
to
do
who
has
a
premature
call
upon
him
for
tom
felt
intensely
that
common
cause
with
his
father
which
springs
from
family
pride
and
was
bent
on
being
irreproachable
as
a
son
but
his
growing
experience
caused
him
to
pass
much
silent
criticism
on
the
rashness
and
imprudence
of
his
father
past
conduct
their
dispositions
were
not
in
sympathy
and
tom
face
showed
little
radiance
during
his
few
home
hours
maggie
had
an
awe
of
him
against
which
she
struggled
as
something
unfair
to
her
consciousness
of
wider
thoughts
and
deeper
motives
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
struggle
a
character
at
unity
with
itself
that
performs
what
it
intends
subdues
every
counteracting
impulse
and
has
no
visions
beyond
the
distinctly
possible
is
strong
by
its
very
negations
you
may
imagine
that
tom
more
and
more
obvious
unlikeness
to
his
father
was
well
fitted
to
conciliate
the
maternal
aunts
and
uncles
and
deane
favorable
reports
and
predictions
to
glegg
concerning
tom
qualifications
for
business
began
to
be
discussed
amongst
them
with
various
acceptance
he
was
likely
it
appeared
to
do
the
family
credit
without
causing
it
any
expense
and
trouble
pullet
had
always
thought
it
strange
if
tom
excellent
complexion
so
entirely
that
of
the
dodsons
did
not
argue
a
certainty
that
he
would
turn
out
well
his
juvenile
errors
of
running
down
the
peacock
and
general
disrespect
to
his
aunts
only
indicating
a
tinge
of
tulliver
blood
which
he
had
doubtless
outgrown
glegg
who
had
contracted
a
cautious
liking
for
tom
ever
since
his
spirited
and
sensible
behavior
when
the
execution
was
in
the
house
was
now
warming
into
a
resolution
to
further
his
prospects
actively
some
time
when
an
opportunity
offered
of
doing
so
in
a
prudent
manner
without
ultimate
loss
but
glegg
observed
that
she
was
not
given
to
speak
without
book
as
some
people
were
that
those
who
said
least
were
most
likely
to
find
their
words
made
good
and
that
when
the
right
moment
came
it
would
be
seen
who
could
do
something
better
than
talk
uncle
pullet
after
silent
meditation
for
a
period
of
several
lozenges
came
distinctly
to
the
conclusion
that
when
a
young
man
was
likely
to
do
well
it
was
better
not
to
meddle
with
him
tom
meanwhile
had
shown
no
disposition
to
rely
on
any
one
but
himself
though
with
a
natural
sensitiveness
toward
all
indications
of
favorable
opinion
he
was
glad
to
see
his
uncle
glegg
look
in
on
him
sometimes
in
a
friendly
way
during
business
hours
and
glad
to
be
invited
to
dine
at
his
house
though
he
usually
preferred
declining
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
sure
of
being
punctual
but
about
a
year
ago
something
had
occurred
which
induced
tom
to
test
his
uncle
glegg
friendly
disposition
bob
jakin
who
rarely
returned
from
one
of
his
rounds
without
seeing
tom
and
maggie
awaited
him
on
the
bridge
as
he
was
coming
home
from
ogg
one
evening
that
they
might
have
a
little
private
talk
he
took
the
liberty
of
asking
if
tom
had
ever
thought
of
making
money
by
trading
a
bit
on
his
own
account
trading
how
tom
wished
to
know
why
by
sending
out
a
bit
of
a
cargo
to
foreign
ports
because
bob
had
a
particular
friend
who
had
offered
to
do
a
little
business
for
him
in
that
way
in
laceham
goods
and
would
be
glad
to
serve
tom
on
the
same
footing
tom
was
interested
at
once
and
begged
for
full
explanation
wondering
he
had
not
thought
of
this
plan
before
he
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
a
speculation
that
might
change
the
slow
process
of
addition
into
multiplication
that
he
at
once
determined
to
mention
the
matter
to
his
father
and
get
his
consent
to
appropriate
some
of
the
savings
in
the
tin
box
to
the
purchase
of
a
small
cargo
he
would
rather
not
have
consulted
his
father
but
he
had
just
paid
his
last
quarter
money
into
the
tin
box
and
there
was
no
other
resource
all
the
savings
were
there
for
tulliver
would
not
consent
to
put
the
money
out
at
interest
lest
he
should
lose
it
since
he
had
speculated
in
the
purchase
of
some
corn
and
had
lost
by
it
he
could
not
be
easy
without
keeping
the
money
under
his
eye
tom
approached
the
subject
carefully
as
he
was
seated
on
the
hearth
with
his
father
that
evening
and
tulliver
listened
leaning
forward
in
his
and
looking
up
in
tom
face
with
a
sceptical
glance
his
first
impulse
was
to
give
a
positive
refusal
but
he
was
in
some
awe
of
tom
wishes
and
since
he
had
the
sense
of
being
an
unlucky
father
he
had
lost
some
of
his
old
peremptoriness
and
determination
to
be
master
he
took
the
key
of
the
bureau
from
his
pocket
got
out
the
key
of
the
large
chest
and
fetched
down
the
tin
box
slowly
as
if
he
were
trying
to
defer
the
moment
of
a
painful
parting
then
he
seated
himself
against
the
table
and
opened
the
box
with
that
little
which
he
fingered
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
in
all
vacant
moments
there
they
were
the
dingy
and
the
bright
sovereigns
and
he
counted
them
out
on
the
table
only
a
hundred
and
sixteen
pounds
in
two
years
after
all
the
pinching
how
much
do
you
want
then
he
said
speaking
as
if
the
words
burnt
his
lips
suppose
i
begin
with
the
pounds
father
said
tom
tulliver
separated
this
sum
from
the
rest
and
keeping
his
hand
over
it
said
it
as
much
as
i
can
save
out
o
my
pay
in
a
year
yes
father
it
is
such
slow
work
saving
out
of
the
little
money
we
get
and
in
this
way
we
might
double
our
savings
ay
my
lad
said
the
father
keeping
his
hand
on
the
money
but
you
might
lose
it
you
might
lose
a
year
o
my
life
and
i
have
got
many
tom
was
silent
and
you
know
i
would
pay
a
dividend
with
the
first
hundred
because
i
wanted
to
see
it
all
in
a
lump
and
when
i
see
it
i
sure
o
if
you
trust
to
luck
it
sure
to
be
against
me
it
old
harry
got
the
luck
in
his
hands
and
if
i
lose
one
year
i
shall
never
pick
it
up
again
death
me
tulliver
voice
trembled
and
tom
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
before
he
said
i
give
it
up
father
since
you
object
to
it
so
strongly
but
unwilling
to
abandon
the
scheme
altogether
he
determined
to
ask
his
uncle
glegg
to
venture
twenty
pounds
on
condition
of
receiving
five
per
cent
of
the
profits
that
was
really
a
very
small
thing
to
ask
so
when
bob
called
the
next
day
at
the
wharf
to
know
the
decision
tom
proposed
that
they
should
go
together
to
his
uncle
glegg
to
open
the
business
for
his
diffident
pride
clung
to
him
and
made
him
feel
that
bobs
tongue
would
relieve
him
from
some
embarrassment
glegg
at
the
pleasant
hour
of
four
in
the
afternoon
of
a
hot
august
day
was
naturally
counting
his
to
assure
himself
that
the
sum
total
had
not
varied
since
yesterday
to
him
entered
tom
in
what
appeared
to
glegg
very
questionable
companionship
that
of
a
man
with
a
pack
on
his
back
for
bob
was
equipped
for
a
new
journey
and
of
a
huge
brindled
who
walked
with
a
slow
swaying
movement
from
side
to
side
and
glanced
from
under
his
with
a
surly
indifference
which
might
after
all
be
a
cover
to
the
most
offensive
designs
glegg
spectacles
which
had
been
assisting
him
in
counting
the
fruit
made
these
suspicious
details
alarmingly
evident
to
him
heigh
heigh
keep
that
dog
back
will
you
he
shouted
snatching
up
a
stake
and
holding
it
before
him
as
a
shield
when
the
visitors
were
within
three
yards
of
him
get
out
wi
you
mumps
said
bob
with
a
kick
he
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
sir
an
observation
which
mumps
corroborated
by
a
low
growl
as
he
retreated
behind
his
master
legs
why
what
ever
does
this
mean
tom
said
glegg
have
you
brought
information
about
the
scoundrels
as
cut
my
trees
if
bob
came
in
the
character
of
information
glegg
saw
reasons
for
tolerating
some
irregularity
no
sir
said
tom
i
came
to
speak
to
you
about
a
little
matter
of
business
of
my
own
ay

but

has
this
dog
got
to
do

the
old
gentleman

mild

allays
if

have
a
pull
at
it

downright

as
when

per
zent
clear

uncle
glegg
stood
with
astonishment
at
this
unembarrassed
loquacity
with
which
his
understanding
could
hardly
keep
pace
he
looked
at
bob
first
over
his
spectacles
then
through
them
then
over
them
again
while
tom
doubtful
of
his
uncle
impression
began
to
wish
he
had
not
brought
this
singular
aaron
or
mouthpiece
bob
talk
appeared
less
seemly
now
some
one
besides
himself
was
listening
to
it
you
seem
to
be
a
knowing
fellow
said
glegg
at
last
ay
sir
you
say
true
returned
bob
nodding
his
head
aside
i
think
my
head
all
alive
inside
like
an
old
cheese
for
i
so
full
o
plans
one
knocks
another
over
if
i
had
mumps
to
talk
to
i
should
get
an
tumble
in
a
fit
i
suppose
it
because
i
niver
went
to
school
much
that
what
i
jaw
my
old
mother
for
i
says
should
ha
sent
me
to
school
a
bit
more
i
says
then
i
could
ha
read
i
the
books
like
fun
an
kep
my
head
cool
empty
lors
she
fine
an
now
my
old
mother
is
she
ates
her
baked
meat
an
taters
as
often
as
she
likes
for
i
so
full
o
money
i
must
hev
a
wife
to
spend
it
for
me
but
botherin
a
wife
is
and
mumps
might
like
her
uncle
glegg
who
regarded
himself
as
a
jocose
man
since
he
had
retired
from
business
was
beginning
to
find
bob
amusing
but
he
had
still
a
disapproving
observation
to
make
which
kept
his
face
serious
ah
he
said
i
should
think
you
at
a
loss
for
ways
o
spending
your
money
else
you
would
keep
that
big
dog
to
eat
as
much
as
two
christians
it
shameful
shameful
but
he
spoke
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
and
quickly
added
but
come
now
let
hear
more
about
this
business
tom
i
suppose
you
want
a
little
sum
to
make
a
venture
with
but
where
all
your
own
money
you
do
spend
it
all
eh
no
sir
said
tom
coloring
but
my
father
is
unwilling
to
risk
it
and
i
do
like
to
press
him
if
i
could
get
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
to
begin
with
i
could
pay
five
per
cent
for
it
and
then
i
could
gradually
make
a
little
capital
of
my
own
and
do
without
a
loan
ay
ay
said
glegg
in
an
approving
tone
that
not
a
bad
notion
and
i
wo
say
as
i
would
be
your
man
but
it
be
as
well
for
me
to
see
this
salt
as
you
talk
on
and
then
here
this
friend
o
yours
offers
to
buy
the
goods
for
you
perhaps
you
got
somebody
to
stand
surety
for
you
if
the
money
put
into
your
hands
added
the
cautious
old
gentleman
looking
over
his
spectacles
at
bob
i
do
think
that
necessary
uncle
said
tom
at
least
i
mean
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
me
because
i
know
bob
well
but
perhaps
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
have
some
security
you
get
your
percentage
out
o
the
purchase
i
suppose
said
glegg
looking
at
bob
no
sir
said
bob
rather
indignantly
i
did
offer
to
get
a
apple
for
tom
o
purpose
to
hev
a
bite
out
of
it
myself
when
i
play
folks
tricks
there
be
more
fun
in
nor
that
well
but
it
nothing
but
right
you
should
have
a
small
percentage
said
glegg
i
no
opinion
o
transactions
where
folks
do
things
for
nothing
it
allays
looks
bad
well
then
said
bob
whose
keenness
saw
at
once
what
was
implied
i
tell
you
what
i
get
an
it
money
in
my
pocket
in
the
end
i
make
myself
look
big
wi
makin
a
bigger
purchase
what
i
thinking
on
lors
i
a
chap
i
am
glegg
mr
glegg
said
a
severe
voice
from
the
open
parlor
window
pray
are
you
coming
in
to
tea
or
are
you
going
to
stand
talking
with
packmen
till
you
get
murdered
in
the
open
daylight
murdered
said
glegg
what
the
woman
talking
of
here
your
nephey
tom
come
about
a
bit
o
business
murdered
yes
it
is
many
ago
since
a
packman
murdered
a
young
woman
in
a
lone
place
and
stole
her
thimble
and
threw
her
body
into
a
ditch
nay
nay
said
glegg
soothingly
you
thinking
o
the
man
wi
no
legs
as
drove
a
well
it
the
same
thing
glegg
only
you
fond
contradicting
what
i
say
and
if
my
nephey
come
about
business
it
be
more
fitting
if
you
bring
him
into
the
house
and
let
his
aunt
know
about
it
instead
o
whispering
in
corners
in
that
plotting
underminding
way
well
well
said
glegg
we
come
in
now
you
need
stay
here
said
the
lady
to
bob
in
a
loud
voice
adapted
to
the
moral
not
the
physical
distance
between
them
we
do
want
anything
i
do
deal
wi
packmen
mind
you
shut
the
gate
after
you
stop
a
bit
not
so
fast
said
glegg
i
have
done
with
this
young
man
yet
come
in
tom
come
in
he
added
stepping
in
at
the
french
window
glegg
said
in
a
fatal
tone
if
you
going
to
let
that
man
and
his
dog
in
on
my
carpet
before
my
very
face
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
know
a
wife
got
a
right
to
ask
that
i
hope
do
you
be
uneasy
mum
said
bob
touching
his
cap
he
saw
at
once
that
glegg
was
a
bit
of
game
worth
running
down
and
longed
to
be
at
the
sport
we
stay
out
upo
the
gravel
here
mumps
and
me
will
mumps
knows
his
company
he
does
i
might
hish
at
him
by
hour
together
before
he
fly
at
a
real
gentlewoman
like
you
wonderful
how
he
knows
which
is
the
ladies
fond
of
when
they
good
shapes
lors
added
bob
laying
down
his
pack
on
the
gravel
it
a
thousand
pities
such
a
lady
as
you
should
deal
with
a
packman
i
stead
o
goin
into
these
newfangled
shops
where
there
fine
gents
their
chins
propped
up
wi
a
stiff
stock
like
bottles
ornamental
stoppers
an
all
got
to
get
their
dinner
out
of
a
bit
calico
it
stan
to
reason
you
must
pay
three
times
the
price
you
pay
a
packman
as
is
the
way
o
gettin
goods
an
pays
no
rent
an
is
forced
to
throttle
himself
till
the
lies
are
squeezed
out
on
him
whether
he
will
or
no
but
lors
mum
you
know
what
it
is
better
nor
i
do
can
see
through
them
shopmen
i
be
bound
yes
i
reckon
i
can
and
through
the
packmen
too
observed
glegg
intending
to
imply
that
bob
flattery
had
produced
no
effect
on
while
her
husband
standing
behind
her
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
legs
apart
winked
and
smiled
with
conjugal
delight
at
the
probability
of
his
wife
being
circumvented
ay
to
be
sure
mum
said
bob
why
you
must
ha
dealt
wi
no
end
o
packmen
when
you
war
a
young
lass
before
the
master
here
had
the
luck
to
set
eyes
on
you
i
know
where
you
lived
i
do
seen
th
house
many
a
time
close
upon
squire
darleigh
a
stone
house
steps
ah
that
it
had
said
glegg
pouring
out
the
tea
you
know
something
o
my
family
then
are
you
akin
to
that
packman
with
a
squint
in
his
eye
as
used
to
bring
th
irish
linen
look
you
there
now
said
bob
evasively
did
i
know
as
remember
the
best
bargains
you
made
in
your
life
was
made
packmen
why
you
see
even
a
squintin
packman
better
nor
a
shopman
as
can
see
straight
lors
if
i
had
the
luck
to
call
at
the
stone
house
wi
my
pack
as
lies
here
stooping
and
thumping
the
bundle
emphatically
with
his
fist
an
th
handsome
young
lasses
all
stannin
out
on
the
stone
steps
it
ud
ha
been
summat
like
openin
a
pack
that
would
it
the
poor
houses
now
as
a
packman
calls
on
if
it
is
for
the
sake
o
the
they
paltry
times
these
are
why
mum
look
at
the
printed
cottons
now
an
what
they
was
when
you
wore
why
you
would
put
such
a
thing
on
now
i
can
see
it
must
be
quality
the
manifactur
as
buy
summat
as
wear
as
well
as
your
own
faitures
yes
better
quality
nor
any
you
like
to
carry
you
got
nothing
but
brazenness
i
be
bound
said
glegg
with
a
triumphant
sense
of
her
insurmountable
sagacity
glegg
are
you
going
ever
to
sit
down
to
your
tea
tom
there
a
cup
for
you
you
speak
true
there
mum
said
bob
my
pack
is
for
ladies
like
you
the
time
gone
by
for
that
bargains
picked
up
dirt
cheap
a
bit
o
damage
here
an
there
as
can
be
cut
out
or
else
niver
seen
i
the
wearin
but
not
fit
to
offer
to
rich
folks
as
can
pay
for
the
look
things
as
nobody
sees
i
not
the
man
as
offer
t
open
my
pack
to
mum
no
no
i
a
imperent
chap
as
you
say
these
times
makes
folks
imperent
but
i
not
up
to
the
mark
o
that
why
what
goods
do
you
carry
in
your
pack
said
glegg
things
i
suppose
shawls
an
that
all
sorts
mum
all
sorts
said
bob
thumping
his
bundle
but
let
us
say
no
more
about
that
if
please
i
here
upo
business
an
i
not
the
man
to
take
up
the
time
wi
my
own
and
pray
what
this
business
as
is
to
be
kept
from
me
said
glegg
who
solicited
by
a
double
curiosity
was
obliged
to
let
the
wait
a
little
plan
o
nephey
tom
here
said
glegg
and
not
altogether
a
bad
i
think
a
little
plan
for
making
money
that
the
right
sort
o
plan
for
young
folks
as
have
got
their
fortin
to
make
eh
jane
but
i
hope
it
is
a
plan
where
he
expects
iverything
to
be
done
for
him
by
his
friends
that
what
the
young
folks
think
of
mostly
nowadays
and
pray
what
has
this
packman
got
to
do
wi
what
goes
on
in
our
family
ca
you
speak
for
yourself
tom
and
let
your
aunt
know
things
as
a
nephey
should
this
is
bob
jakin
aunt
said
tom
bridling
the
irritation
that
aunt
glegg
voice
always
produced
i
known
him
ever
since
we
were
little
boys
he
a
very
good
fellow
and
always
ready
to
do
me
a
kindness
and
he
has
had
some
experience
in
sending
goods
out
a
small
part
of
a
cargo
as
a
private
speculation
and
he
thinks
if
i
could
begin
to
do
a
little
in
the
same
way
i
might
make
some
money
a
large
interest
is
got
in
that
way
large
said
aunt
glegg
with
eagerness
and
what
do
you
call
large
ten
or
twelve
per
cent
bob
says
after
expenses
are
paid
then
why
was
i
let
to
know
o
such
things
before
mr
glegg
said
glegg
turning
to
her
husband
with
a
deep
grating
tone
of
reproach
have
you
allays
told
me
as
there
was
no
getting
more
nor
five
per
cent
pooh
pooh
nonsense
my
good
woman
said
glegg
you
go
into
trade
could
you
you
ca
get
more
than
five
per
cent
with
security
but
i
can
turn
a
bit
o
money
for
you
an
welcome
mum
said
bob
if
you
like
to
risk
it
not
as
there
any
risk
to
speak
on
but
if
you
a
mind
to
lend
a
bit
o
money
to
tom
he
pay
you
six
or
seven
per
zent
an
get
a
trifle
for
himself
as
well
an
a
lady
like
you
like
the
feel
o
the
money
better
if
your
nephey
took
part
on
it
what
do
you
say
mrs
said
glegg
i
a
notion
when
made
a
bit
more
inquiry
as
i
shall
perhaps
start
tom
here
with
a
bit
of
a
he
pay
me
you
know
an
if
you
got
some
little
sums
lyin
idle
twisted
up
in
a
stockin
toe
or
that
glegg
it
beyond
iverything
you
go
and
give
information
to
the
tramps
next
as
they
may
come
and
rob
me
well
well
as
i
was
sayin
if
you
like
to
join
me
wi
twenty
pounds
you
can
i
make
it
fifty
that
be
a
pretty
good
eh
tom
you
not
counting
on
me
glegg
i
hope
said
his
wife
you
could
do
fine
things
wi
my
money
i
do
doubt
very
well
said
glegg
rather
snappishly
then
we
do
without
you
i
shall
go
with
you
to
see
this
salt
he
added
turning
to
bob
and
now
i
suppose
you
go
all
the
other
way
glegg
said
and
want
to
shut
me
out
o
my
own
nephey
business
i
never
said
i
would
put
money
into
it
i
do
say
as
it
shall
be
twenty
pounds
though
you
so
ready
to
say
it
for
me
but
he
see
some
day
as
his
aunt
in
the
right
not
to
risk
the
money
she
saved
for
him
till
it
proved
as
it
wo
be
lost
ay
that
a
pleasant
sort
that
is
said
glegg
indiscreetly
winking
at
tom
who
could
avoid
smiling
but
bob
stemmed
the
injured
lady
outburst
ay
mum
he
said
admiringly
you
know
what
what
you
do
an
nothing
but
fair
see
how
the
first
bit
of
a
job
answers
then

fine
thing
to

bit
of

by
my
own
sharpness
ten
suvreigns
it
was
wi

fire
at

an
it
growed

bit

a
bit
till

said
glegg
in
a
patronizing
tone
moving
from
the
and
folding
her
napkin
eh
mum
not
what
you
think
it
worth
your
while
to
look
at
scorn
to
show
it

it
be
an
insult
to
you
but
let
me
see
said
glegg
still
patronizing
if
damaged
goods
they
like
enough
to
be
a
bit
the
better
quality
no
mum
i
know
my
place
said
bob
lifting
up
his
pack
and
shouldering
it
i
not
going
t
expose
the
lowness
o
my
trade
to
a
lady
like

the
world

you
to
heart
to

a
mind

place

glegg
drawing
a
chair
to
the
window
and
seating
herself
with
much
dignity

bob
entreatingly

more
words

glegg
severely
but

loth
that

am
said
bob
slowly
depositing
his
pack
on
the
step
and
beginning
to
untie
it
with
unwilling
fingers
but
what
you
order
shall
be
done
much
fumbling
in
pauses
between
the
sentences
it
not
as
you
buy
a
single
thing
on
me
i
be
sorry
for
you
to
do
it
for
think
o
them
poor
women
up
i
the
villages
there
as

a
hundred
yards
from

it
be
a
pity
for
anybody
to

it
as
good
as
a
junketing
to
when
they
see
me
wi
my
pack
an
i
shall
niver
pick
up
such
bargains
for
again
least
ways

off
to
laceham

bob
went
on
becoming
rapid
again
and
holding
up
a
scarlet
woollen
kerchief

shillin
apiece

thack
to
make
a
bit
of
a
blaze
for
lors
it
as
good
as

a

bob

glegg
authoritatively
bob

ostentatious
reluctance

what
there

over

he
said
holding
forth
the
extra
while
glegg
was
busy
examining
the
damaged
yard
and
throwing
her
head
back
to
see
how
far
the
fault
would
be
lost
on
a
distant
view
i
give
you
six
shilling
for

she
said
throwing
it
down
with
the
air
of
a
person

ultimatum

feelings

i

stay

catechism
afore

what

bit
glegg
said
the
lady
as
her
husband
took
his
hat
you
never
give
me
the
chance
o
speaking
you
go
away
now
and
finish
everything
about
this
business
and
come
back
and
tell
me
it
too
late
for
me
to
speak
as
if
i
was
my
nephey
own
aunt
and
the
head
o
the
family
on
his
mother
side
and
laid
by
guineas
all
full
weight
for
him
as
he
know
who
to
respect
when
i
laid
in
my
coffin
well
say
what
you
mean
said
hastily
well
then
i
desire
as
nothing
may
be
done
without
my
knowing
i
do
say
as
i
venture
twenty
pounds
if
you
make
out
as
everything
right
and
safe
and
if
i
do
tom
concluded
glegg
turning
impressively
to
her
nephew
i
hope
you
allays
bear
it
in
mind
and
be
grateful
for
such
an
aunt
i
mean
you
to
pay
me
interest
you
know
i
do
approve
o
giving
we
niver
looked
for
that
in
family
thank
you
aunt
said
tom
rather
proudly
i
prefer
having
the
money
only
lent
to
me
very
well
that
the
dodson
sperrit
said
glegg
rising
to
get
her
knitting
with
the
sense
that
any
further
remark
after
this
would
be
bathos
salt
that
eminently
briny
chap
having
been
discovered
in
a
cloud
of
at
the
anchor
tavern
glegg
commenced
inquiries
which
turned
out
satisfactorily
enough
to
warrant
the
advance
of
the
to
which
aunt
glegg
contributed
twenty
pounds
and
in
this
modest
beginning
you
see
the
ground
of
a
fact
which
might
otherwise
surprise
you
namely
tom
accumulation
of
a
fund
unknown
to
his
father
that
promised
in
no
very
long
time
to
meet
the
more
tardy
process
of
saving
and
quite
cover
the
deficit
when
once
his
attention
had
been
turned
to
this
source
of
gain
tom
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
obtaining
information
and
extending
his
small
enterprises
in
not
telling
his
father
he
was
influenced
by
that
strange
mixture
of
opposite
feelings
which
often
gives
equal
truth
to
those
who
blame
an
action
and
those
who
admire
it
partly
it
was
that
disinclination
to
confidence
which
is
seen
between
near
kindred
that
family
repulsion
which
spoils
the
most
sacred
relations
of
our
lives
partly
it
was
the
desire
to
surprise
his
father
with
a
great
joy
he
did
not
see
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
soothe
the
interval
with
a
new
hope
and
prevent
the
delirium
of
a
too
sudden
elation
at
the
time
of
maggie
first
meeting
with
philip
tom
had
already
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
his
own
capital
and
while
they
were
walking
by
the
evening
light
in
the
red
deeps
he
by
the
same
evening
light
was
riding
into
laceham
proud
of
being
on
his
first
journey
on
behalf
of
guest
and
revolving
in
his
mind
all
the
chances
that
by
the
end
of
another
year
he
should
have
doubled
his
gains
lifted
off
the
obloquy
of
debt
from
his
father
name
and
perhaps
for
he
should
be
have
got
a
new
start
for
himself
on
a
higher
platform
of
employment
did
he
not
desire
it
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
did
chapter
iii
the
wavering
balance
i
said
that
maggie
went
home
that
evening
from
the
red
deeps
with
a
mental
conflict
already
begun
you
have
seen
clearly
enough
in
her
interview
with
philip
what
that
conflict
was
here
suddenly
was
an
opening
in
the
rocky
wall
which
shut
in
the
narrow
valley
of
humiliation
where
all
her
prospect
was
the
remote
unfathomed
sky
and
some
of
the
earthly
delights
were
no
longer
out
of
her
reach
she
might
have
books
converse
affection
she
might
hear
tidings
of
the
world
from
which
her
mind
had
not
yet
lost
its
sense
of
exile
and
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
philip
too
who
was
pitiable
clearly
not
happy
and
perhaps
here
was
an
opportunity
indicated
for
making
her
mind
more
worthy
of
its
highest
service
perhaps
the
noblest
completest
devoutness
could
hardly
exist
without
some
width
of
knowledge
she
always
live
in
this
resigned
imprisonment
it
was
so
blameless
so
good
a
thing
that
there
should
be
friendship
between
her
and
philip
the
motives
that
forbade
it
were
so
unreasonable
so
unchristian
but
the
severe
monotonous
warning
came
again
and
again
that
she
was
losing
the
simplicity
and
clearness
of
her
life
by
admitting
a
ground
of
concealment
and
that
by
forsaking
the
simple
rule
of
renunciation
she
was
throwing
herself
under
the
seductive
guidance
of
illimitable
wants
she
thought
she
had
won
strength
to
obey
the
warning
before
she
allowed
herself
the
next
week
to
turn
her
steps
in
the
evening
to
the
red
deeps
but
while
she
was
resolved
to
say
an
affectionate
farewell
to
philip
how
she
looked
forward
to
that
evening
walk
in
the
still
fleckered
shade
of
the
hollows
away
from
all
that
was
harsh
and
unlovely
to
the
affectionate
admiring
looks
that
would
meet
her
to
the
sense
of
comradeship
that
childish
memories
would
give
to
wiser
older
talk
to
the
certainty
that
philip
would
care
to
hear
everything
she
said
which
no
one
else
cared
for
it
was
a
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
turn
her
back
upon
with
the
sense
that
there
would
be
no
other
like
it
yet
she
said
what
she
meant
to
say
she
looked
firm
as
well
as
sad
philip
i
have
made
up
my
mind
it
is
right
that
we
should
give
each
other
up
in
everything
but
memory
i
could
not
see
you
without
concealment
stay
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
it
is
other
people
wrong
feelings
that
make
concealment
necessary
but
concealment
is
bad
however
it
may
be
caused
i
feel
that
it
would
be
bad
for
me
for
us
both
and
then
if
our
secret
were
discovered
there
would
be
nothing
but
misery
dreadful
anger
and
then
we
must
part
after
all
and
it
would
be
harder
when
we
were
used
to
seeing
each
other
philip
face
had
flushed
and
there
was
a
momentary
eagerness
of
expression
as
if
he
had
been
about
to
resist
this
decision
with
all
his
might
but
he
controlled
himself
and
said
with
assumed
calmness
well
maggie
if
we
must
part
let
us
try
and
forget
it
for
one
half
hour
let
us
talk
together
a
little
while
for
the
last
time
he
took
her
hand
and
maggie
felt
no
reason
to
withdraw
it
his
quietness
made
her
all
the
more
sure
she
had
given
him
great
pain
and
she
wanted
to
show
him
how
unwillingly
she
had
given
it
they
walked
together
hand
in
hand
in
silence
let
us
sit
down
in
the
hollow
said
philip
where
we
stood
the
last
time
see
how
the
have
strewed
the
ground
and
spread
their
opal
petals
over
it
they
sat
down
at
the
roots
of
the
slanting
ash
i
begun
my
picture
of
you
among
the
scotch
firs
maggie
said
philip
so
you
must
let
me
study
your
face
a
little
while
you
stay
since
i
am
not
to
see
it
again
please
turn
your
head
this
way
this
was
said
in
an
entreating
voice
and
it
would
have
been
very
hard
of
maggie
to
refuse
the
full
lustrous
face
with
the
bright
black
coronet
looked
down
like
that
of
a
divinity
well
pleased
to
be
worshipped
on
the
face
that
was
turned
up
to
it
i
shall
be
sitting
for
my
second
portrait
then
she
said
smiling
will
it
be
larger
than
the
other
oh
yes
much
larger
it
is
an
you
will
look
like
a
tall
hamadryad
dark
and
strong
and
noble
just
issued
from
one
of
the
when
the
stems
are
casting
their
afternoon
shadows
on
the
grass
you
seem
to
think
more
of
painting
than
of
anything
now
philip
perhaps
i
do
said
philip
rather
sadly
but
i
think
of
too
many
things
sow
all
sorts
of
seeds
and
get
no
great
harvest
from
any
one
of
them
i
cursed
with
susceptibility
in
every
direction
and
effective
faculty
in
none
i
care
for
painting
and
music
i
care
for
classic
literature
and
mediæval
literature
and
modern
literature
i
flutter
all
ways
and
fly
in
none
but
surely
that
is
a
happiness
to
have
so
many
tastes
to
enjoy
so
many
beautiful
things
when
they
are
within
your
reach
said
maggie
musingly
it
always
seemed
to
me
a
sort
of
clever
stupidity
only
to
have
one
sort
of
talent
almost
like
a
it
might
be
a
happiness
to
have
many
tastes
if
i
were
like
other
men
said
philip
bitterly
i
might
get
some
power
and
distinction
by
mere
mediocrity
as
they
do
at
least
i
should
get
those
middling
satisfactions
which
make
men
contented
to
do
without
great
ones
i
might
think
society
at
ogg
agreeable
then
but
nothing
could
make
life
worth
the
of
pain
to
me
but
some
faculty
that
would
lift
me
above
the
dead
level
of
provincial
existence
yes
there
is
one
thing
a
passion
answers
as
well
as
a
faculty
maggie
did
not
hear
the
last
words
she
was
struggling
against
the
consciousness
that
philip
words
had
set
her
own
discontent
vibrating
again
as
it
used
to
do
i
understand
what
you
mean
she
said
though
i
know
so
much
less
than
you
do
i
used
to
think
i
could
never
bear
life
if
it
kept
on
being
the
same
every
day
and
i
must
always
be
doing
things
of
no
consequence
and
never
know
anything
greater
but
dear
philip
i
think
we
are
only
like
children
that
some
one
who
is
wiser
is
taking
care
of
is
it
not
right
to
resign
ourselves
entirely
whatever
may
be
denied
us
i
have
found
great
peace
in
that
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
even
joy
in
subduing
my
own
will
yes
maggie
said
philip
vehemently
and
you
are
shutting
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
fanaticism
which
is
only
a
way
of
escaping
pain
by
starving
into
dulness
all
the
highest
powers
of
your
nature
joy
and
peace
are
not
resignation
resignation
is
the
willing
endurance
of
a
pain
that
is
not
allayed
that
you
do
expect
to
be
allayed
stupefaction
is
not
resignation
and
it
is
stupefaction
to
remain
in
ignorance
to
shut
up
all
the
avenues
by
which
the
life
of
your
might
become
known
to
you
i
am
not
resigned
i
am
not
sure
that
life
is
long
enough
to
learn
that
lesson
are
not
resigned
you
are
only
trying
to
stupefy
yourself
maggie
lips
trembled
she
felt
there
was
some
truth
in
what
philip
said
and
yet
there
was
a
deeper
consciousness
that
for
any
immediate
application
it
had
to
her
conduct
it
was
no
better
than
falsity
her
double
impression
corresponded
to
the
double
impulse
of
the
speaker
philip
seriously
believed
what
he
said
but
he
said
it
with
vehemence
because
it
made
an
argument
against
the
resolution
that
opposed
his
wishes
but
maggie
face
made
more
childlike
by
the
gathering
tears
touched
him
with
a
tenderer
less
egotistic
feeling
he
took
her
hand
and
said
gently
do
let
us
think
of
such
things
in
this
short
maggie
let
us
only
care
about
being
together
we
shall
be
friends
in
spite
of
separation
we
shall
always
think
of
each
other
i
shall
be
glad
to
live
as
long
as
you
are
alive
because
i
shall
think
there
may
always
come
a
time
when
i
can
when
you
will
let
me
help
you
in
some
way
what
a
dear
good
brother
you
would
have
been
philip
said
maggie
smiling
through
the
haze
of
tears
i
think
you
would
have
made
as
much
fuss
about
me
and
been
as
pleased
for
me
to
love
you
as
would
have
satisfied
even
me
you
would
have
loved
me
well
enough
to
bear
with
me
and
forgive
me
everything
that
was
what
i
always
longed
that
tom
should
do
i
was
never
satisfied
with
a
of
anything
that
is
why
it
is
better
for
me
to
do
without
earthly
happiness
altogether
i
never
felt
that
i
had
enough
music
i
wanted
more
instruments
playing
together
i
wanted
voices
to
be
fuller
and
deeper
do
you
ever
sing
now
philip
she
added
abruptly
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
went
before
yes
he
said
every
day
almost
but
my
voice
is
only
middling
like
everything
else
in
me
oh
sing
me
something
just
one
song
i
listen
to
that
before
i
go
something
you
used
to
sing
at
lorton
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
we
had
the
all
to
ourselves
and
i
put
my
apron
over
my
head
to
listen
know
said
philip
and
maggie
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
while
he
sang
love
in
her
eyes
sits
playing
and
then
said
that
it
is
it
oh
no
i
wo
stay
said
maggie
starting
up
it
will
only
haunt
me
let
us
walk
philip
i
must
go
home
she
moved
away
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
rise
and
follow
her
maggie
he
said
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
do
persist
in
this
wilful
senseless
privation
it
makes
me
wretched
to
see
you
benumbing
and
cramping
your
nature
in
this
way
you
were
so
full
of
life
when
you
were
a
child
i
thought
you
would
be
a
brilliant
woman
all
wit
and
bright
imagination
and
it
flashes
out
in
your
face
still
until
you
draw
that
veil
of
dull
quiescence
over
it
why
do
you
speak
so
bitterly
to
me
philip
said
maggie
because
i
foresee
it
will
not
end
well
you
can
never
carry
on
this
i
shall
have
strength
given
me
said
maggie
tremulously
no
you
will
not
maggie
no
one
has
strength
given
to
do
what
is
unnatural
it
is
mere
cowardice
to
seek
safety
in
negations
no
character
becomes
strong
in
that
way
you
will
be
thrown
into
the
world
some
day
and
then
every
rational
satisfaction
of
your
nature
that
you
deny
now
will
assault
you
like
a
savage
appetite
maggie
started
and
paused
looking
at
philip
with
alarm
in
her
face
philip
how
dare
you
shake
me
in
this
way
you
are
a
tempter
no
i
am
not
but
love
gives
insight
maggie
and
insight
often
gives
foreboding
to
me
let
supply
you
with
books
do
let
me
see
you
sometimes
be
your
brother
and
teacher
as
you
said
at
lorton
it
is
less
wrong
that
you
should
see
me
than
that
you
should
be
committing
this
long
suicide
maggie
felt
unable
to
speak
she
shook
her
head
and
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
scotch
firs
and
she
put
out
her
hand
in
sign
of
parting
do
you
banish
me
from
this
place
forever
then
maggie
surely
i
may
come
and
walk
in
it
sometimes
if
i
meet
you
by
chance
there
is
no
concealment
in
that
it
is
the
moment
when
our
resolution
seems
about
to
become
irrevocable
when
the
fatal
iron
gates
are
about
to
close
upon
us
that
tests
our
strength
then
after
hours
of
clear
reasoning
and
firm
conviction
we
snatch
at
any
sophistry
that
will
nullify
our
long
struggles
and
bring
us
the
defeat
that
we
love
better
than
victory
maggie
felt
her
heart
leap
at
this
subterfuge
of
philip
and
there
passed
over
her
face
that
almost
imperceptible
shock
which
accompanies
any
relief
he
saw
it
and
they
parted
in
silence
philip
sense
of
the
situation
was
too
complete
for
him
not
to
be
visited
with
glancing
fears
lest
he
had
been
intervening
too
presumptuously
in
the
action
of
maggie
conscience
perhaps
for
a
selfish
end
but
no
he
persuaded
himself
his
end
was
not
selfish
he
had
little
hope
that
maggie
would
ever
return
the
strong
feeling
he
had
for
her
and
it
must
be
better
for
maggie
future
life
when
these
petty
family
obstacles
to
her
freedom
had
disappeared
that
the
present
should
not
be
entirely
sacrificed
and
that
she
should
have
some
opportunity
of
culture
some
interchange
with
a
mind
above
the
vulgar
level
of
those
she
was
now
condemned
to
live
with
if
we
only
look
far
enough
off
for
the
consequence
of
our
actions
we
can
always
find
some
point
in
the
combination
of
results
by
which
those
actions
can
be
justified
by
adopting
the
point
of
view
of
a
providence
who
arranges
results
or
of
a
philosopher
who
traces
them
we
shall
find
it
possible
to
obtain
perfect
complacency
in
choosing
to
do
what
is
most
agreeable
to
us
in
the
present
moment
and
it
was
in
this
way
that
philip
justified
his
subtle
efforts
to
overcome
maggie
true
prompting
against
a
concealment
that
would
introduce
doubleness
into
her
own
mind
and
might
cause
new
misery
to
those
who
had
the
primary
natural
claim
on
her
but
there
was
a
surplus
of
passion
in
him
that
made
him
half
independent
of
justifying
motives
his
longing
to
see
maggie
and
make
an
element
in
her
life
had
in
it
some
of
that
savage
impulse
to
snatch
an
offered
joy
which
springs
from
a
life
in
which
the
mental
and
bodily
constitution
have
made
pain
predominate
he
had
not
his
full
share
in
the
common
good
of
men
he
could
not
even
pass
muster
with
the
insignificant
but
must
be
singled
out
for
pity
and
excepted
from
what
was
a
matter
of
course
with
others
even
to
maggie
he
was
an
exception
it
was
clear
that
the
thought
of
his
being
her
lover
had
never
entered
her
mind
do
not
think
too
hardly
of
philip
ugly
and
deformed
people
have
great
need
of
unusual
virtues
because
they
are
likely
to
be
extremely
uncomfortable
without
them
but
the
theory
that
unusual
virtues
spring
by
a
direct
consequence
out
of
personal
disadvantages
as
animals
get
thicker
wool
in
severe
climates
is
perhaps
a
little
overstrained
the
temptations
of
beauty
are
much
dwelt
upon
but
i
fancy
they
only
bear
the
same
relation
to
those
of
ugliness
as
the
temptation
to
excess
at
a
feast
where
the
delights
are
varied
for
eye
and
ear
as
well
as
palate
bears
to
the
temptations
that
assail
the
desperation
of
hunger
does
not
the
hunger
tower
stand
as
the
type
of
the
utmost
trial
to
what
is
human
in
us
philip
had
never
been
soothed
by
that
mother
love
which
flows
out
to
us
in
the
greater
abundance
because
our
need
is
greater
which
clings
to
us
the
more
tenderly
because
we
are
the
less
likely
to
be
winners
in
the
game
of
life
and
the
sense
of
his
father
affection
and
indulgence
toward
him
was
marred
by
the
keener
perception
of
his
father
faults
kept
aloof
from
all
practical
life
as
philip
had
been
and
by
nature
half
feminine
in
sensitiveness
he
had
some
of
the
woman
intolerant
repulsion
toward
worldliness
and
the
deliberate
pursuit
of
sensual
enjoyment
and
this
one
strong
natural
tie
in
his
life
his
relation
as
a
son
was
like
an
aching
limb
to
him
perhaps
there
is
inevitably
something
morbid
in
a
human
being
who
is
in
any
way
unfavorably
excepted
from
ordinary
conditions
until
the
good
force
has
had
time
to
triumph
and
it
has
rarely
had
time
for
that
at
that
force
was
present
in
philip
in
much
strength
but
the
sun
himself
looks
feeble
through
the
morning
mists
chapter
iv
another
early
in
the
following
april
nearly
a
year
after
that
dubious
parting
you
have
just
witnessed
you
may
if
you
like
again
see
maggie
entering
the
red
deeps
through
the
group
of
scotch
firs
but
it
is
early
afternoon
and
not
evening
and
the
edge
of
sharpness
in
the
spring
air
makes
her
draw
her
large
shawl
close
about
her
and
trip
along
rather
quickly
though
she
looks
round
as
usual
that
she
may
take
in
the
sight
of
her
beloved
trees
there
is
a
more
eager
inquiring
look
in
her
eyes
than
there
was
last
june
and
a
smile
is
hovering
about
her
lips
as
if
some
playful
speech
were
awaiting
the
right
hearer
the
hearer
was
not
long
in
appearing
take
back
your
said
maggie
drawing
a
book
from
under
her
shawl
you
were
right
in
telling
me
she
would
do
me
no
good
but
you
were
wrong
in
thinking
i
should
wish
to
be
like
her
would
you
really
like
to
be
a
tenth
muse
then
maggie
said
philip
looking
up
in
her
face
as
we
look
at
a
first
parting
in
the
clouds
that
promises
us
a
bright
heaven
once
more
not
at
all
said
maggie
laughing
the
muses
were
uncomfortable
goddesses
i
think
obliged
always
to
carry
rolls
and
musical
instruments
about
with
them
if
i
carried
a
harp
in
this
climate
you
know
i
must
have
a
green
baize
cover
for
it
and
i
should
be
sure
to
leave
it
behind
me
by
mistake
you
agree
with
me
in
not
liking
corinne
then
i
did
finish
the
book
said
maggie
as
soon
as
i
came
to
the
young
lady
reading
in
the
park
i
shut
it
up
and
determined
to
read
no
further
i
foresaw
that
that
girl
would
win
away
all
the
love
from
corinne
and
make
her
miserable
i
determined
to
read
no
more
books
where
the
women
carry
away
all
the
happiness
i
should
begin
to
have
a
prejudice
against
them
if
you
could
give
me
some
story
now
where
the
dark
woman
triumphs
it
would
restore
the
balance
i
want
to
avenge
rebecca
and
flora
macivor
and
minna
and
all
the
rest
of
the
dark
unhappy
ones
since
you
are
my
tutor
you
ought
to
preserve
my
mind
from
prejudices
you
are
always
arguing
against
prejudices
well
perhaps
you
will
avenge
the
dark
women
in
your
own
person
and
carry
away
all
the
love
from
your
cousin
lucy
she
is
sure
to
have
some
handsome
young
man
of
ogg
at
her
feet
now
and
you
have
only
to
shine
upon
him
your
fair
little
cousin
will
be
quite
quenched
in
your
beams
philip
that
is
not
pretty
of
you
to
apply
my
nonsense
to
anything
real
said
maggie
looking
hurt
as
if
i
with
my
old
gowns
and
want
of
all
accomplishments
could
be
a
rival
of
dear
little
lucy
who
knows
and
does
all
sorts
of
charming
things
and
is
ten
times
prettier
than
i
am
even
if
i
were
odious
and
base
enough
to
wish
to
be
her
rival
besides
i
never
go
to
aunt
deane
when
any
one
is
there
it
is
only
because
dear
lucy
is
good
and
loves
me
that
she
comes
to
see
me
and
will
have
me
go
to
see
her
sometimes
maggie
said
philip
with
surprise
it
is
not
like
you
to
take
playfulness
literally
you
must
have
been
in
ogg
this
morning
and
brought
away
a
slight
infection
of
dulness
well
said
maggie
smiling
if
you
meant
that
for
a
joke
it
was
a
poor
one
but
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
reproof
i
thought
you
wanted
to
remind
me
that
i
am
vain
and
wish
every
one
to
admire
me
most
but
it
is
for
that
that
i
jealous
for
the
dark
women
not
because
i
dark
myself
it
because
i
always
care
the
most
about
the
unhappy
people
if
the
blond
girl
were
forsaken
i
should
like
best
i
always
take
the
side
of
the
rejected
lover
in
the
stories
then
you
would
never
have
the
heart
to
reject
one
yourself
should
you
maggie
said
philip
flushing
a
little
i
do
know
said
maggie
hesitatingly
then
with
a
bright
smile
i
think
perhaps
i
could
if
he
were
very
conceited
and
yet
if
he
got
extremely
humiliated
afterward
i
should
relent
i
often
wondered
maggie
philip
said
with
some
effort
whether
you
would
really
be
more
likely
to
love
a
man
that
other
women
were
not
likely
to
love
that
would
depend
on
what
they
did
like
him
for
said
maggie
laughing
he
might
be
very
disagreeable
he
might
look
at
me
through
an
stuck
in
his
eye
making
a
hideous
face
as
young
torry
does
i
should
think
other
women
are
not
fond
of
that
but
i
never
felt
any
pity
for
young
torry
i
never
any
pity
for
conceited
people
because
i
think
they
carry
their
comfort
about
with
them
but
suppose
maggie
suppose
it
was
a
man
who
was
not
conceited
who
felt
he
had
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
who
had
been
marked
from
childhood
for
a
peculiar
kind
of
suffering
and
to
whom
you
were
the
of
his
life
who
loved
you
worshipped
you
so
entirely
that
he
felt
it
happiness
enough
for
him
if
you
would
let
him
see
you
at
rare
moments
philip
paused
with
a
pang
of
dread
lest
his
confession
should
cut
short
this
very
happiness
a
pang
of
the
same
dread
that
had
kept
his
love
mute
through
long
months
a
rush
of
told
him
that
he
was
besotted
to
have
said
all
this
maggie
manner
this
morning
had
been
as
unconstrained
and
indifferent
as
ever
but
she
was
not
looking
indifferent
now
struck
with
the
unusual
emotion
in
philip
tone
she
had
turned
quickly
to
look
at
him
and
as
he
went
on
speaking
a
great
change
came
over
her
face
a
flush
and
slight
spasm
of
the
features
such
as
we
see
in
people
who
hear
some
news
that
will
require
them
to
readjust
their
conceptions
of
the
past
she
was
quite
silent
and
walking
on
toward
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
she
sat
down
as
if
she
had
no
strength
to
spare
for
her
muscles
she
was
trembling
maggie
said
philip
getting
more
and
more
alarmed
in
every
fresh
moment
of
silence
i
was
a
fool
to
say
it
forget
that
i
said
it
i
shall
be
contented
if
things
can
be
as
they
were
the
distress
with
which
he
spoke
urged
maggie
to
say
something
i
am
so
surprised
philip
i
had
not
thought
of
it
and
the
effort
to
say
this
brought
the
tears
down
too
has
it
made
you
hate
me
maggie
said
philip
impetuously
do
you
think
i
a
presumptuous
fool
oh
philip
said
maggie
how
can
you
think
i
have
such
feelings
as
if
i
were
not
grateful
for
love
but
but
i
had
never
thought
of
your
being
my
lover
it
seemed
so
far
off
like
a
dream
only
like
one
of
the
stories
one
imagines
that
i
should
ever
have
a
lover
then
can
you
bear
to
think
of
me
as
your
lover
maggie
said
philip
seating
himself
by
her
and
taking
her
hand
in
the
elation
of
a
sudden
hope
you
love
me
maggie
turned
rather
pale
this
direct
question
seemed
not
easy
to
answer
but
her
eyes
met
philip
which
were
in
this
moment
liquid
and
beautiful
with
beseeching
love
she
spoke
with
hesitation
yet
with
sweet
simple
girlish
tenderness
i
think
i
could
hardly
love
any
one
better
there
is
nothing
but
what
i
love
you
for
she
paused
a
little
while
and
then
added
but
it
will
be
better
for
us
not
to
say
any
more
about
it
wo
it
dear
philip
you
know
we
could
even
be
friends
if
our
friendship
were
discovered
i
have
never
felt
that
i
was
right
in
giving
way
about
seeing
you
though
it
has
been
so
precious
to
me
in
some
ways
and
now
the
fear
comes
upon
me
strongly
again
that
it
will
lead
to
evil
but
no
evil
has
come
maggie
and
if
you
had
been
guided
by
that
fear
before
you
would
only
have
lived
through
another
dreary
benumbing
year
instead
of
reviving
into
your
real
self
maggie
shook
her
head
it
has
been
very
sweet
i
know
all
the
talking
together
and
the
books
and
the
feeling
that
i
had
the
walk
to
look
forward
to
when
i
could
tell
you
the
thoughts
that
had
come
into
my
head
while
i
was
away
from
you
but
it
has
made
me
restless
it
has
made
me
think
a
great
deal
about
the
world
and
i
have
impatient
thoughts
again
i
get
weary
of
my
home
and
then
it
cuts
me
to
the
heart
afterward
that
i
should
ever
have
felt
weary
of
my
father
and
mother
i
think
what
you
call
being
benumbed
was
better
better
for
me
for
then
my
selfish
desires
were
benumbed
philip
had
risen
again
and
was
walking
backward
and
forward
impatiently
no
maggie
you
have
wrong
ideas
of
as
i
often
told
you
what
you
call
binding
and
deafening
yourself
to
all
but
one
train
of
impressions
is
only
the
culture
of
monomania
in
a
nature
like
yours
he
had
spoken
with
some
irritation
but
now
he
sat
down
by
her
again
and
took
her
hand
do
think
of
the
past
now
maggie
think
only
of
our
love
if
you
can
really
cling
to
me
with
all
your
heart
every
obstacle
will
be
overcome
in
time
we
need
only
wait
i
can
live
on
hope
look
at
me
maggie
tell
me
again
it
is
possible
for
you
to
love
me
do
look
away
from
me
to
that
cloven
tree
it
is
a
bad
omen
she
turned
her
large
dark
glance
upon
him
with
a
sad
smile
come
maggie
say
one
kind
word
or
else
you
were
better
to
me
at
lorton
you
asked
me
if
i
should
like
you
to
kiss
me
do
you
remember
and
you
promised
to
kiss
me
when
you
met
me
again
you
never
kept
the
promise
the
recollection
of
that
childish
time
came
as
a
sweet
relief
to
maggie
it
made
the
present
moment
less
strange
to
her
she
kissed
him
almost
as
simply
and
quietly
as
she
had
done
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
philip
eyes
flashed
with
delight
but
his
next
words
were
words
of
discontent
you
do
seem
happy
enough
maggie
you
are
forcing
yourself
to
say
you
love
me
out
of
pity
no
philip
said
maggie
shaking
her
head
in
her
old
childish
way
i
telling
you
the
truth
it
is
all
new
and
strange
to
me
but
i
do
think
i
could
love
any
one
better
than
i
love
you
i
should
like
always
to
live
with
you
to
make
you
happy
i
have
always
been
happy
when
i
have
been
with
you
there
is
only
one
thing
i
will
not
do
for
your
sake
i
will
never
do
anything
to
wound
my
father
you
must
never
ask
that
from
me
no
maggie
i
will
ask
nothing
i
will
bear
everything
i
wait
another
year
only
for
a
kiss
if
you
will
only
give
me
the
first
place
in
your
heart
no
said
maggie
smiling
i
wo
make
you
wait
so
long
as
that
but
then
looking
serious
again
she
added
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
but
what
would
your
own
father
say
philip
oh
it
is
quite
impossible
we
can
ever
be
more
than
friends
brother
and
sister
in
secret
as
we
have
been
let
us
give
up
thinking
of
everything
else
no
maggie
i
ca
give
you
up
unless
you
are
deceiving
me
unless
you
really
only
care
for
me
as
if
i
were
your
brother
tell
me
the
truth
indeed
i
do
philip
what
happiness
have
i
ever
had
so
great
as
being
with
you
since
i
was
a
little
girl
the
days
tom
was
good
to
me
and
your
mind
is
a
sort
of
world
to
me
you
can
tell
me
all
i
want
to
know
i
think
i
should
never
be
tired
of
being
with
you
they
were
walking
hand
in
hand
looking
at
each
other
maggie
indeed
was
hurrying
along
for
she
felt
it
time
to
be
gone
but
the
sense
that
their
parting
was
near
made
her
more
anxious
lest
she
should
have
unintentionally
left
some
painful
impression
on
philip
mind
it
was
one
of
those
dangerous
moments
when
speech
is
at
once
sincere
and
deceptive
when
feeling
rising
high
above
its
average
depth
leaves
floodmarks
which
are
never
reached
again
they
stopped
to
part
among
the
scotch
firs
then
my
life
will
be
filled
with
hope
maggie
and
i
shall
be
happier
than
other
men
in
spite
of
all
we
belong
to
each
other
for
always
whether
we
are
apart
or
together
yes
philip
i
should
like
never
to
part
i
should
like
to
make
your
life
very
happy
i
am
waiting
for
something
else
i
wonder
whether
it
will
come
maggie
smiled
with
glistening
tears
and
then
stooped
her
tall
head
to
kiss
the
pale
face
that
was
full
of
pleading
timid
love
like
a
woman
she
had
a
moment
of
real
happiness
then
a
moment
of
belief
that
if
there
were
sacrifice
in
this
love
it
was
all
the
richer
and
more
satisfying
she
turned
away
and
hurried
home
feeling
that
in
the
hour
since
she
had
trodden
this
road
before
a
new
era
had
begun
for
her
the
tissue
of
vague
dreams
must
now
get
narrower
and
narrower
and
all
the
threads
of
thought
and
emotion
be
gradually
absorbed
in
the
woof
of
her
actual
daily
life
chapter
v
the
cloven
tree
secrets
are
rarely
betrayed
or
discovered
according
to
any
programme
our
fear
has
sketched
out
fear
is
almost
always
haunted
by
terrible
dramatic
scenes
which
recur
in
spite
of
the
probabilities
against
them
and
during
a
year
that
maggie
had
had
the
burthen
of
concealment
on
her
mind
the
possibility
of
discovery
had
continually
presented
itself
under
the
form
of
a
sudden
meeting
with
her
father
or
tom
when
she
was
walking
with
philip
in
the
red
deeps
she
was
aware
that
this
was
not
one
of
the
most
likely
events
but
it
was
the
scene
that
most
completely
symbolized
her
inward
dread
those
slight
indirect
suggestions
which
are
dependent
on
apparently
trivial
coincidences
and
incalculable
states
of
mind
are
the
favorite
machinery
of
fact
but
are
not
the
stuff
in
which
imagination
is
apt
to
work
certainly
one
of
the
persons
about
whom
maggie
fears
were
furthest
from
troubling
themselves
was
her
aunt
pullet
on
whom
seeing
that
she
did
not
live
in
ogg
and
was
neither
nor
it
would
surely
have
been
quite
whimsical
of
them
to
fix
rather
than
on
aunt
glegg
and
yet
the
channel
of
fatality
the
pathway
of
the
lightning
was
no
other
than
aunt
pullet
she
did
not
live
at
ogg
but
the
road
from
garum
firs
lay
by
the
red
deeps
at
the
end
opposite
that
by
which
maggie
entered
the
day
after
maggie
last
meeting
with
philip
being
a
sunday
on
which
pullet
was
bound
to
appear
in
funeral
hatband
and
scarf
at
ogg
church
pullet
made
this
the
occasion
of
dining
with
sister
glegg
and
taking
tea
with
poor
sister
tulliver
sunday
was
the
one
day
in
the
week
on
which
tom
was
at
home
in
the
afternoon
and
today
the
brighter
spirits
he
had
been
in
of
late
had
flowed
over
in
unusually
cheerful
open
chat
with
his
father
and
in
the
invitation
come
magsie
you
come
too
when
he
strolled
out
with
his
mother
in
the
garden
to
see
the
advancing
he
had
been
better
pleased
with
maggie
since
she
had
been
less
odd
and
ascetic
he
was
even
getting
rather
proud
of
her
several
persons
had
remarked
in
his
hearing
that
his
sister
was
a
very
fine
girl
there
was
a
peculiar
brightness
in
her
face
due
in
reality
to
an
undercurrent
of
excitement
which
had
as
much
doubt
and
pain
as
pleasure
in
it
but
it
might
pass
for
a
sign
of
happiness
you
look
very
well
my
dear
said
aunt
pullet
shaking
her
head
sadly
as
they
sat
round
the
i
niver
thought
your
girl
be
so
bessy
but
you
must
wear
pink
my
dear
that
blue
thing
as
your
aunt
glegg
gave
you
turns
you
into
a
crowflower
jane
never
tasty
why
do
you
wear
that
gown
o
mine
it
is
so
pretty
and
so
smart
aunt
i
think
it
too
showy
for
me
at
least
for
my
other
clothes
that
i
must
wear
with
it
to
be
sure
it
be
unbecoming
if
it
was
well
known
you
got
them
belonging
to
you
as
can
afford
to
give
you
such
things
when
they
done
with
themselves
it
stands
to
reason
i
must
give
my
own
niece
clothes
now
and
then
such
things
as
buy
every
year
and
never
wear
anything
out
and
as
for
lucy
there
no
giving
to
her
for
she
got
everything
o
the
choicest
sister
deane
may
well
hold
her
head
up
though
she
looks
dreadful
yallow
poor
thing
i
doubt
this
liver
complaint
carry
her
off
that
what
this
new
vicar
this
kenn
said
in
the
funeral
sermon
ah
he
a
wonderful
preacher
by
all
account
is
he
sophy
said
tulliver
why
lucy
had
got
a
collar
on
this
blessed
day
continued
pullet
with
her
eyes
fixed
in
a
ruminating
manner
as
i
do
say
i
have
got
as
good
but
i
must
look
out
my
best
to
match
it
miss
lucy
called
the
bell
o
ogg
they
say
that
a
word
observed
pullet
on
whom
the
mysteries
of
etymology
sometimes
fell
with
an
oppressive
weight
pooh
said
tulliver
jealous
for
maggie
she
a
small
thing
not
much
of
a
figure
but
fine
feathers
make
fine
birds
i
see
nothing
to
admire
so
much
in
those
diminutive
women
they
look
silly
by
the
side
o
the
men
out
o
proportion
when
i
chose
my
wife
i
chose
her
the
right
size
neither
too
little
nor
too
big
the
poor
wife
with
her
withered
beauty
smiled
complacently
but
the
men
are
big
said
uncle
pullet
not
without
some
a
young
fellow
may
be
and
yet
not
be
a
like
master
tom
here
ah
it
poor
talking
about
littleness
and
bigness
anybody
may
think
it
a
mercy
they
straight
said
aunt
pullet
there
that
mismade
son
o
lawyer
wakem
i
saw
him
at
church
dear
dear
to
think
o
the
property
he
like
to
have
and
they
say
he
very
queer
and
lonely
does
like
much
company
i
should
wonder
if
he
goes
out
of
his
mind
for
we
never
come
along
the
road
but
out
o
the
trees
and
brambles
at
the
red
deeps
this
wide
statement
by
which
pullet
represented
the
fact
that
she
had
twice
seen
philip
at
the
spot
indicated
produced
an
effect
on
maggie
which
was
all
the
stronger
because
tom
sate
opposite
her
and
she
was
intensely
anxious
to
look
indifferent
at
philip
name
she
had
blushed
and
the
blush
deepened
every
instant
from
consciousness
until
the
mention
of
the
red
deeps
made
her
feel
as
if
the
whole
secret
were
betrayed
and
she
dared
not
even
hold
her
lest
she
should
show
how
she
trembled
she
sat
with
her
hands
clasped
under
the
table
not
daring
to
look
round
happily
her
father
was
seated
on
the
same
side
with
herself
beyond
her
uncle
pullet
and
could
not
see
her
face
without
stooping
forward
her
mother
voice
brought
the
first
relief
turning
the
conversation
for
tulliver
was
always
alarmed
when
the
name
of
wakem
was
mentioned
in
her
presence
gradually
maggie
recovered
composure
enough
to
look
up
her
eyes
met
tom
but
he
turned
away
his
head
immediately
and
she
went
to
bed
that
night
wondering
if
he
had
gathered
any
suspicion
from
her
confusion
perhaps
not
perhaps
he
would
think
it
was
only
her
alarm
at
her
aunt
mention
of
wakem
before
her
father
that
was
the
interpretation
her
mother
had
put
in
it
to
her
father
wakem
was
like
a
disfiguring
disease
of
which
he
was
obliged
to
endure
the
consciousness
but
was
exasperated
to
have
the
existence
recognized
by
others
and
no
amount
of
sensitiveness
in
her
about
her
father
could
be
surprising
maggie
thought
but
tom
was
too
to
rest
satisfied
with
such
an
interpretation
he
had
seen
clearly
enough
that
there
was
something
distinct
from
anxiety
about
her
father
in
maggie
excessive
confusion
in
trying
to
recall
all
the
details
that
could
give
shape
to
his
suspicions
he
remembered
only
lately
hearing
his
mother
scold
maggie
for
walking
in
the
red
deeps
when
the
ground
was
wet
and
bringing
home
shoes
clogged
with
red
soil
still
tom
retaining
all
his
old
repulsion
for
philip
deformity
shrank
from
attributing
to
his
sister
the
probability
of
feeling
more
than
a
friendly
interest
in
such
an
unfortunate
exception
to
the
common
run
of
men
tom
was
a
nature
which
had
a
sort
of
superstitious
repugnance
to
everything
exceptional
a
love
for
a
deformed
man
would
be
odious
in
any
woman
in
a
sister
intolerable
but
if
she
had
been
carrying
on
any
kind
of
intercourse
whatever
with
philip
a
stop
must
be
put
to
it
at
once
she
was
disobeying
her
father
strongest
feelings
and
her
express
commands
besides
compromising
herself
by
secret
meetings
he
left
home
the
next
morning
in
that
watchful
state
of
mind
which
turns
the
most
ordinary
course
of
things
into
pregnant
coincidences
that
afternoon
about
three
tom
was
standing
on
the
wharf
talking
with
bob
jakin
about
the
probability
of
the
good
ship
adelaide
coming
in
in
a
day
or
two
with
results
highly
important
to
both
of
them
eh
said
bob
parenthetically
as
he
looked
over
the
fields
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
there
goes
that
crooked
young
wakem
i
know
him
or
his
shadder
as
far
off
as
i
can
see
i
allays
lighting
on
him
o
that
side
the
river
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
have
darted
through
tom
mind
i
must
go
bob
he
said
i
something
to
attend
to
hurrying
off
to
the
warehouse
where
he
left
notice
for
some
one
to
take
his
place
he
was
called
away
home
on
peremptory
business
the
swiftest
pace
and
the
shortest
road
took
him
to
the
gate
and
he
was
pausing
to
open
it
deliberately
that
he
might
walk
into
the
house
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
composure
when
maggie
came
out
at
the
front
door
in
bonnet
and
shawl
his
conjecture
was
fulfilled
and
he
waited
for
her
at
the
gate
she
started
violently
when
she
saw
him
tom
how
is
it
you
are
come
home
is
there
anything
the
matter
maggie
spoke
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
i
come
to
walk
with
you
to
the
red
deeps
and
meet
philip
wakem
said
tom
the
central
fold
in
his
brow
which
had
become
habitual
with
him
deepening
as
he
spoke
maggie
stood
helpless
pale
and
cold
by
some
means
then
tom
knew
everything
at
last
she
said
i
not
going
and
turned
round
yes
you
are
but
i
want
to
speak
to
you
first
where
is
my
father
out
on
horseback
and
my
mother
in
the
yard
i
think
with
the
poultry
i
can
go
in
then
without
her
seeing
me
they
walked
in
together
and
tom
entering
the
parlor
said
to
maggie
come
in
here
she
obeyed
and
he
closed
the
door
behind
her
now
maggie
tell
me
this
instant
everything
that
has
passed
between
you
and
philip
wakem
does
my
father
know
anything
said
maggie
still
trembling
no
said
tom
indignantly
but
he
know
if
you
attempt
to
use
deceit
toward
me
any
further
i
do
wish
to
use
deceit
said
maggie
flushing
into
resentment
at
hearing
this
word
applied
to
her
conduct
tell
me
the
whole
truth
then
perhaps
you
know
it
never
mind
whether
i
know
it
or
not
tell
me
exactly
what
has
happened
or
my
father
shall
know
everything
i
tell
it
for
my
father
sake
then
yes
it
becomes
you
to
profess
affection
for
your
father
when
you
have
despised
his
strongest
feelings
you
never
do
wrong
tom
said
maggie
tauntingly
not
if
i
know
it
answered
tom
with
proud
sincerity
but
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
beyond
this
tell
me
what
has
passed
between
you
and
philip
wakem
when
did
you
first
meet
him
in
the
red
deeps
a
year
ago
said
maggie
quietly
tom
severity
gave
her
a
certain
fund
of
defiance
and
kept
her
sense
of
error
in
abeyance
you
need
ask
me
no
more
questions
we
have
been
friendly
a
year
we
have
met
and
walked
together
often
he
has
lent
me
books
is
that
all
said
tom
looking
straight
at
her
with
his
frown
maggie
paused
a
moment
then
determined
to
make
an
end
of
tom
right
to
accuse
her
of
deceit
she
said
haughtily
no
not
quite
all
on
saturday
he
told
me
that
he
loved
me
i
think
of
it
before
then
i
had
only
thought
of
him
as
an
old
friend
and
you
him
said
tom
with
an
expression
of
disgust
i
told
him
that
i
loved
him
too
tom
was
silent
a
few
moments
looking
on
the
ground
and
frowning
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
at
last
he
looked
up
and
said
coldly
now
then
maggie
there
are
but
two
courses
for
you
to
take
either
you
vow
solemnly
to
me
with
your
hand
on
my
father
bible
that
you
will
never
have
another
meeting
or
speak
another
word
in
private
with
philip
wakem
or
you
refuse
and
i
tell
my
father
everything
and
this
month
when
by
my
exertions
he
might
be
made
happy
once
more
you
will
cause
him
the
blow
of
knowing
that
you
are
a
disobedient
deceitful
daughter
who
throws
away
her
own
respectability
by
clandestine
meetings
with
the
son
of
a
man
that
has
helped
to
ruin
her
father
choose
tom
ended
with
cold
decision
going
up
to
the
large
bible
drawing
it
forward
and
opening
it
at
the
where
the
writing
was
it
was
a
crushing
alternative
to
maggie
tom
she
said
urged
out
of
pride
into
pleading
do
ask
me
that
i
will
promise
you
to
give
up
all
intercourse
with
philip
if
you
will
let
me
see
him
once
or
even
only
write
to
him
and
explain
everything
to
give
it
up
as
long
as
it
would
ever
cause
any
pain
to
my
father
i
feel
something
for
philip
too
is
not
happy
i
do
wish
to
hear
anything
of
your
feelings
i
have
said
exactly
what
i
mean
choose
and
quickly
lest
my
mother
should
come
in
if
i
give
you
my
word
that
will
be
as
strong
a
bond
to
me
as
if
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
bible
i
do
require
that
to
bind
me
do
what
require
said
tom
i
ca
trust
you
maggie
there
is
no
consistency
in
you
put
your
hand
on
this
bible
and
say
renounce
all
private
speech
and
intercourse
with
philip
wakem
from
this
time
forth
else
you
will
bring
shame
on
us
all
and
grief
on
my
father
and
what
is
the
use
of
my
exerting
myself
and
giving
up
everything
else
for
the
sake
of
paying
my
father
debts
if
you
are
to
bring
madness
and
vexation
on
him
just
when
he
might
be
easy
and
hold
up
his
head
once
more
oh
tom
the
debts
be
paid
soon
said
maggie
clasping
her
hands
with
a
sudden
flash
of
joy
across
her
wretchedness
if
things
turn
out
as
i
expect
said
tom
but
he
added
his
voice
trembling
with
indignation
while
i
have
been
contriving
and
working
that
my
father
may
have
some
peace
of
mind
before
he
dies
working
for
the
respectability
of
our
family
you
have
done
all
you
can
to
destroy
both
maggie
felt
a
deep
movement
of
compunction
for
the
moment
her
mind
ceased
to
contend
against
what
she
felt
to
be
cruel
and
unreasonable
and
in
her
she
justified
her
brother
tom
she
said
in
a
low
voice
it
was
wrong
of
me
but
i
was
so
lonely
and
i
was
sorry
for
philip
and
i
think
enmity
and
hatred
are
wicked
nonsense
said
tom
your
duty
was
clear
enough
say
no
more
but
promise
in
the
words
i
told
you
i
speak
to
philip
once
more
you
will
go
with
me
now
and
speak
to
him
i
give
you
my
word
not
to
meet
him
or
write
to
him
again
without
your
knowledge
that
is
the
only
thing
i
will
say
i
will
put
my
hand
on
the
bible
if
you
like
say
it
then
maggie
laid
her
hand
on
the
page
of
manuscript
and
repeated
the
promise
tom
closed
the
book
and
said
now
let
us
go
not
a
word
was
spoken
as
they
walked
along
maggie
was
suffering
in
anticipation
of
what
philip
was
about
to
suffer
and
dreading
the
galling
words
that
would
fall
on
him
from
tom
lips
but
she
felt
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
anything
but
submission
tom
had
his
terrible
clutch
on
her
conscience
and
her
deepest
dread
she
writhed
under
the
demonstrable
truth
of
the
character
he
had
given
to
her
conduct
and
yet
her
whole
soul
rebelled
against
it
as
unfair
from
its
incompleteness
he
meanwhile
felt
the
impetus
of
his
indignation
diverted
toward
philip
he
did
not
know
how
much
of
an
old
boyish
repulsion
and
of
mere
personal
pride
and
animosity
was
concerned
in
the
bitter
severity
of
the
words
by
which
he
meant
to
do
the
duty
of
a
son
and
a
brother
tom
was
not
given
to
inquire
subtly
into
his
own
motives
any
more
than
into
other
matters
of
an
intangible
kind
he
was
quite
sure
that
his
own
motives
as
well
as
actions
were
good
else
he
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
maggie
only
hope
was
that
something
might
for
the
first
time
have
prevented
philip
from
coming
then
there
would
be
delay
then
she
might
get
tom
permission
to
write
to
him
her
heart
beat
with
double
violence
when
they
got
under
the
scotch
firs
it
was
the
last
moment
of
suspense
she
thought
philip
always
met
her
soon
after
she
got
beyond
them
but
they
passed
across
the
more
open
green
space
and
entered
the
narrow
bushy
path
by
the
mound
another
turning
and
they
came
so
close
upon
him
that
both
tom
and
philip
stopped
suddenly
within
a
yard
of
each
other
there
was
a
moment
silence
in
which
philip
darted
a
look
of
inquiry
at
maggie
face
he
saw
an
answer
there
in
the
pale
parted
lips
and
the
terrified
tension
of
the
large
eyes
her
imagination
always
rushing
extravagantly
beyond
an
immediate
impression
saw
her
tall
strong
brother
grasping
the
feeble
philip
bodily
crushing
him
and
trampling
on
him
do
you
call
this
acting
the
part
of
a
man
and
a
gentleman
sir
tom
said
in
a
voice
of
harsh
scorn
as
soon
as
philip
eyes
were
turned
on
him
again
what
do
you
mean
answered
philip
haughtily
mean
stand
farther
from
me
lest
i
should
lay
hands
on
you
and
tell
you
what
i
mean
i
mean
taking
advantage
of
a
young
foolishness
and
ignorance
to
get
her
to
have
secret
meetings
with
you
i
mean
daring
to
trifle
with
the
respectability
of
a
family
that
has
a
good
and
honest
name
to
support
i
deny
that
interrupted
philip
impetuously
i
could
never
trifle
with
anything
that
affected
your
sister
happiness
she
is
dearer
to
me
than
she
is
to
you
i
honor
her
more
than
you
can
ever
honor
her
i
would
give
up
my
life
to
her
do
talk
nonsense
to
me
sir
do
you
mean
to
pretend
that
you
did
know
it
would
be
injurious
to
her
to
meet
you
here
week
after
week
do
you
pretend
you
had
any
right
to
make
professions
of
love
to
her
even
if
you
had
been
a
fit
husband
for
her
when
neither
her
father
nor
your
father
would
ever
consent
to
a
marriage
between
you
and
to
try
and
worm
yourself
into
the
affections
of
a
handsome
girl
who
is
not
eighteen
and
has
been
shut
out
from
the
world
by
her
father
misfortunes
that
your
crooked
notion
of
honor
is
it
i
call
it
base
treachery
i
call
it
taking
advantage
of
circumstances
to
win
what
too
good
for
you
what
never
get
by
fair
means
it
is
manly
of
you
to
talk
in
this
way
to
said
philip
bitterly
his
whole
frame
shaken
by
violent
emotions
giants
have
an
immemorial
right
to
stupidity
and
insolent
abuse
you
are
incapable
even
of
understanding
what
i
feel
for
your
sister
i
feel
so
much
for
her
that
i
could
even
desire
to
be
at
friendship
with
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
understand
your
feelings
said
tom
with
scorching
contempt
what
i
wish
is
that
you
should
understand
that
i
shall
take
care
of
sister
and
that
if
you
dare
to
make
the
least
attempt
to
come
near
her
or
to
write
to
her
or
to
keep
the
slightest
hold
on
her
mind
your
puny
miserable
body
that
ought
to
have
put
some
modesty
into
your
mind
shall
not
protect
you
i
thrash
you
i
hold
you
up
to
public
scorn
who
would
laugh
at
the
idea
of
turning
lover
to
a
fine
girl
tom
and
maggie
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
he
burst
out
in
a
convulsed
voice
stay
maggie
said
philip
making
a
strong
effort
to
speak
then
looking
at
tom
you
have
dragged
your
sister
here
i
suppose
that
she
may
stand
by
while
you
threaten
and
insult
me
these
naturally
seemed
to
you
the
right
means
to
influence
me
but
you
are
mistaken
let
your
sister
speak
if
she
says
she
is
bound
to
give
me
up
i
shall
abide
by
her
wishes
to
the
slightest
word
it
was
for
my
father
sake
philip
said
maggie
imploringly
tom
threatens
to
tell
my
father
and
he
could
bear
it
i
have
promised
i
have
vowed
solemnly
that
we
will
not
have
any
intercourse
without
my
brother
knowledge
it
is
enough
maggie
shall
not
change
but
i
wish
you
to
hold
yourself
entirely
free
but
trust
me
remember
that
i
can
never
seek
for
anything
but
good
to
what
belongs
to
you
yes
said
tom
exasperated
by
this
attitude
of
philip
you
can
talk
of
seeking
good
for
her
and
what
belongs
to
her
now
did
you
seek
her
good
before
i
did
at
some
risk
perhaps
but
i
wished
her
to
have
a
friend
for
life
who
would
cherish
her
who
would
do
her
more
justice
than
a
coarse
and
brother
that
she
has
always
lavished
her
affections
on
yes
my
way
of
befriending
her
is
different
from
yours
and
i
tell
you
what
is
my
way
i
save
her
from
disobeying
and
disgracing
her
father
i
save
her
from
throwing
herself
away
on
you
from
making
herself
a
from
being
flouted
by
a
man
like
father
because
she
not
good
enough
for
his
son
you
know
well
enough
what
sort
of
justice
and
cherishing
you
were
preparing
for
her
i
not
to
be
imposed
upon
by
fine
words
i
can
see
what
actions
mean
come
away
maggie
he
seized
maggie
right
wrist
as
he
spoke
and
she
put
out
her
left
hand
philip
clasped
it
an
instant
with
one
eager
look
and
then
hurried
away
tom
and
maggie
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
he
was
still
holding
her
wrist
tightly
as
if
he
were
compelling
a
culprit
from
the
scene
of
action
at
last
maggie
with
a
violent
snatch
drew
her
hand
away
and
her
irritation
burst
into
utterance
do
suppose
that
i
think
you
are
right
tom
or
that
i
bow
to
your
will
i
despise
the
feelings
you
have
shown
in
speaking
to
philip
i
detest
your
insulting
unmanly
allusions
to
his
deformity
you
have
been
reproaching
other
people
all
your
life
you
have
been
always
sure
you
yourself
are
right
it
is
because
you
have
not
a
mind
large
enough
to
see
that
there
is
anything
better
than
your
own
conduct
and
your
own
petty
aims
certainly
said
tom
coolly
i
do
see
that
your
conduct
is
better
or
your
aims
either
if
your
conduct
and
philip
conduct
has
been
right
why
are
you
ashamed
of
its
being
known
answer
me
that
i
know
what
i
have
aimed
at
in
my
conduct
and
succeeded
pray
what
good
has
your
conduct
brought
to
you
or
any
one
else
i
do
want
to
defend
myself
said
maggie
still
with
vehemence
i
know
i
been
wrong
often
continually
but
yet
sometimes
when
i
have
done
wrong
it
has
been
because
i
have
feelings
that
you
would
be
the
better
for
if
you
had
them
if
were
in
fault
ever
if
you
had
done
anything
very
wrong
i
should
be
sorry
for
the
pain
it
brought
you
i
should
not
want
punishment
to
be
heaped
on
you
but
you
have
always
enjoyed
punishing
me
you
have
always
been
hard
and
cruel
to
me
even
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
always
loved
you
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
you
would
let
me
go
crying
to
bed
without
forgiving
me
you
have
no
pity
you
have
no
sense
of
your
own
imperfection
and
your
own
sins
it
is
a
sin
to
be
hard
it
is
not
fitting
for
a
mortal
for
a
christian
you
are
nothing
but
a
pharisee
you
thank
god
for
nothing
but
your
own
virtues
you
think
they
are
great
enough
to
win
you
everything
else
you
have
not
even
a
vision
of
feelings
by
the
side
of
which
your
shining
virtues
are
mere
darkness
well
said
tom
with
cold
scorn
if
your
feelings
are
so
much
better
than
mine
let
me
see
you
show
them
in
some
other
way
than
by
conduct
that
likely
to
disgrace
us
all
than
by
ridiculous
flights
first
into
one
extreme
and
then
into
another
pray
how
have
you
shown
your
love
that
you
talk
of
either
to
me
or
my
father
by
disobeying
and
deceiving
us
i
have
a
different
way
of
showing
my
affection
because
you
are
a
man
tom
and
have
power
and
can
do
something
in
the
world
then
if
you
can
do
nothing
submit
to
those
that
can
so
i
submit
to
what
i
acknowledge
and
feel
to
be
right
i
will
submit
even
to
what
is
unreasonable
from
my
father
but
i
will
not
submit
to
it
from
you
you
boast
of
your
virtues
as
if
they
purchased
you
a
right
to
be
cruel
and
unmanly
as
you
been
suppose
i
would
give
up
philip
wakem
in
obedience
to
you
the
deformity
you
insult
would
make
me
cling
to
him
and
care
for
him
the
more
very
well
that
is
your
view
of
things
said
tom
more
coldly
than
ever
you
need
say
no
more
to
show
me
what
a
wide
distance
there
is
between
us
let
us
remember
that
in
future
and
be
silent
tom
went
back
to
ogg
to
fulfill
an
appointment
with
his
uncle
deane
and
receive
directions
about
a
journey
on
which
he
was
to
set
out
the
next
morning
maggie
went
up
to
her
own
room
to
pour
out
all
that
indignant
remonstrance
against
which
tom
mind
was
close
barred
in
bitter
tears
then
when
the
first
burst
of
unsatisfied
anger
was
gone
by
came
the
recollection
of
that
quiet
time
before
the
pleasure
which
had
ended
in
misery
had
perturbed
the
clearness
and
simplicity
of
her
life
she
used
to
think
in
that
time
that
she
had
made
great
conquests
and
won
a
lasting
stand
on
serene
heights
above
worldly
temptations
and
conflict
and
here
she
was
down
again
in
the
thick
of
a
hot
strife
with
her
own
and
others
passions
life
was
not
so
short
then
and
perfect
rest
was
not
so
near
as
she
had
dreamed
when
she
was
two
years
younger
there
was
more
struggle
for
her
and
perhaps
more
falling
if
she
had
felt
that
she
was
entirely
wrong
and
that
tom
had
been
entirely
right
she
could
sooner
have
recovered
more
inward
harmony
but
now
her
penitence
and
submission
were
constantly
obstructed
by
resentment
that
would
present
itself
to
her
no
otherwise
than
as
a
just
indignation
her
heart
bled
for
philip
she
went
on
recalling
the
insults
that
had
been
flung
at
him
with
so
vivid
a
conception
of
what
he
had
felt
under
them
that
it
was
almost
like
a
sharp
bodily
pain
to
her
making
her
beat
the
floor
with
her
foot
and
tighten
her
fingers
on
her
palm
and
yet
how
was
it
that
she
was
now
and
then
conscious
of
a
certain
dim
background
of
relief
in
the
forced
separation
from
philip
surely
it
was
only
because
the
sense
of
a
deliverance
from
concealment
was
welcome
at
any
cost
chapter
vi
the
triumph
three
weeks
later
when
dorlcote
mill
was
at
its
prettiest
moment
in
all
the
year
the
great
chestnuts
in
blossom
and
the
grass
all
deep
and
daisied
tom
tulliver
came
home
to
it
earlier
than
usual
in
the
evening
and
as
he
passed
over
the
bridge
he
looked
with
the
old
affection
at
the
respectable
red
brick
house
which
always
seemed
cheerful
and
inviting
outside
let
the
rooms
be
as
bare
and
the
hearts
as
sad
as
they
might
inside
there
is
a
very
pleasant
light
in
tom
eyes
as
he
glances
at
the
that
fold
in
his
brow
never
disappears
but
it
is
not
unbecoming
it
seems
to
imply
a
strength
of
will
that
may
possibly
be
without
harshness
when
the
eyes
and
mouth
have
their
gentlest
expression
his
firm
step
becomes
quicker
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
rebel
against
the
compression
which
is
meant
to
forbid
a
smile
the
eyes
in
the
parlor
were
not
turned
toward
the
bridge
just
then
and
the
group
there
was
sitting
in
unexpectant
silence
tulliver
in
his
tired
with
a
long
ride
and
ruminating
with
a
worn
look
fixed
chiefly
on
maggie
who
was
bending
over
her
sewing
while
her
mother
was
making
the
tea
they
all
looked
up
with
surprise
when
they
heard
the
foot
why
what
up
now
tom
said
his
father
you
a
bit
earlier
than
usual
oh
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
so
i
came
away
well
mother
tom
went
up
to
his
mother
and
kissed
her
a
sign
of
unusual
with
him
hardly
a
word
or
look
had
passed
between
him
and
maggie
in
all
the
three
weeks
but
his
usual
incommunicativeness
at
home
prevented
this
from
being
noticeable
to
their
parents
father
said
tom
when
they
had
finished
tea
do
you
know
exactly
how
much
money
there
is
in
the
tin
box
only
a
hundred
and
pound
said
tulliver
brought
less
o
late
but
young
fellows
like
to
have
their
own
way
with
their
money
though
i
did
do
as
i
liked
before
was
of
age
he
spoke
with
rather
timid
discontent
are
you
quite
sure
that
the
sum
father
said
tom
i
wish
you
would
take
the
trouble
to
fetch
the
tin
box
down
i
think
you
have
perhaps
made
a
mistake
how
should
i
make
a
mistake
said
his
father
sharply
i
counted
it
often
enough
but
i
can
fetch
it
if
you
wo
believe
me
it
was
always
an
incident
tulliver
liked
in
his
gloomy
life
to
fetch
the
tin
box
and
count
the
money
do
go
out
of
the
room
mother
said
tom
as
he
saw
her
moving
when
his
father
was
gone
upstairs
and
is
maggie
to
go
said
tulliver
because
somebody
must
take
away
the
things
just
as
she
likes
said
tom
indifferently
that
was
a
cutting
word
to
maggie
her
heart
had
leaped
with
the
sudden
conviction
that
tom
was
going
to
tell
their
father
the
debts
could
be
paid
and
tom
would
have
let
her
be
absent
when
that
news
was
told
but
she
carried
away
the
tray
and
came
back
immediately
the
feeling
of
injury
on
her
own
behalf
could
not
predominate
at
that
moment
tom
drew
to
the
corner
of
the
table
near
his
father
when
the
tin
box
was
set
down
and
opened
and
the
red
evening
light
falling
on
them
made
conspicuous
the
worn
sour
gloom
of
the
father
and
the
suppressed
joy
in
the
face
of
the
son
the
mother
and
maggie
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
one
in
blank
patience
the
other
in
palpitating
expectation
tulliver
counted
out
the
money
setting
it
in
order
on
the
table
and
then
said
glancing
sharply
at
tom
there
now
you
see
i
was
right
enough
he
paused
looking
at
the
money
with
bitter
despondency
there
more
nor
three
hundred
wanting
it
be
a
fine
while
before
can
save
that
losing
that
pound
wi
the
corn
was
a
sore
job
this
world
been
too
many
for
me
it
took
four
year
to
lay
by
it
much
if
i
above
ground
for
another
four
year
i
must
trusten
to
you
to
pay
he
went
on
with
a
trembling
voice
if
you
keep
i
the
same
mind
now
you
coming
o
age
but
you
like
enough
to
bury
me
first
he
looked
up
in
tom
face
with
a
querulous
desire
for
some
assurance
no
father
said
tom
speaking
with
energetic
decision
though
there
was
tremor
discernible
in
his
voice
too
you
will
live
to
see
the
debts
all
paid
you
shall
pay
them
with
your
own
hand
his
tone
implied
something
more
than
mere
hopefulness
or
resolution
a
slight
electric
shock
seemed
to
pass
through
tulliver
and
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
tom
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
while
maggie
unable
to
restrain
herself
rushed
to
her
father
side
and
knelt
down
by
him
tom
was
silent
a
little
while
before
he
went
on
a
good
while
ago
my
uncle
glegg
lent
me
a
little
money
to
trade
with
and
that
has
answered
i
have
three
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
in
the
bank
his
mother
arms
were
round
his
neck
as
soon
as
the
last
words
were
uttered
and
she
said
half
crying
oh
my
boy
i
knew
you
make
iverything
right
again
when
you
got
a
man
but
his
father
was
silent
the
flood
of
emotion
hemmed
in
all
power
of
speech
both
tom
and
maggie
were
struck
with
fear
lest
the
shock
of
joy
might
even
be
fatal
but
the
blessed
relief
of
tears
came
the
broad
chest
heaved
the
muscles
of
the
face
gave
way
and
the
man
burst
into
loud
sobs
the
fit
of
weeping
gradually
subsided
and
he
sat
quiet
recovering
the
regularity
of
his
breathing
at
last
he
looked
up
at
his
wife
and
said
in
a
gentle
tone
bessy
you
must
come
and
kiss
me
now
the
lad
has
made
you
amends
you
see
a
bit
o
comfort
again
belike
when
she
had
kissed
him
and
he
had
held
her
hand
a
minute
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
money
i
wish
you
brought
me
the
money
to
look
at
tom
he
said
fingering
the
sovereigns
on
the
table
i
should
ha
felt
surer
you
shall
see
it
father
said
tom
my
uncle
deane
has
appointed
the
creditors
to
meet
at
the
golden
lion
and
he
has
ordered
a
dinner
for
them
at
two
my
uncle
glegg
and
he
will
both
be
there
it
was
advertised
in
the
on
saturday
then
wakem
knows
o
said
tulliver
his
eye
kindling
with
triumphant
fire
ah
he
went
on
with
a
guttural
enunciation
taking
out
his
the
only
luxury
he
had
left
himself
and
tapping
it
with
something
of
his
old
air
of
defiance
i
get
from
under
thumb
now
though
i
leave
the
old
mill
i
thought
i
could
ha
held
out
to
die
here
but
i
ca
got
a
glass
o
nothing
in
the
house
have
we
bessy
yes
said
tulliver
drawing
out
her
bunch
of
keys
there
some
brandy
sister
deane
brought
me
when
i
was
get
it
me
then
get
it
me
i
feel
a
bit
weak
tom
my
lad
he
said
in
a
stronger
voice
when
he
had
taken
some
you
shall
make
a
speech
to
i
tell
you
as
got
the
best
part
o
the
money

an
honest
son
ah

glad
to

fine

poor
crooked
creatur

my
lad

the
day
when

his
son

partnership
as
your
uncle
deane

before

the
right
way
and
then
there
nothing
to
hinder
your
getting
rich
and
if
ever
you
rich
enough
mind
this
try
and
get
th
old
mill
again
tulliver
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
his
mind
which
had
so
long
been
the
home
of
nothing
but
bitter
discontent
and
foreboding
suddenly
filled
by
the
magic
of
joy
with
visions
of
good
fortune
but
some
subtle
influence
prevented
him
from
foreseeing
the
good
fortune
as
happening
to
himself
shake
hands
wi
me
my
lad
he
said
suddenly
putting
out
his
hand
it
a
great
thing
when
a
man
can
be
proud
as
he
got
a
good
son
i
had
luck
tom
never
lived
to
taste
another
moment
so
delicious
as
that
and
maggie
could
help
forgetting
her
own
grievances
tom
good
and
in
the
sweet
humility
that
springs
in
us
all
in
moments
of
true
admiration
and
gratitude
she
felt
that
the
faults
he
had
to
pardon
in
her
had
never
been
redeemed
as
his
faults
were
she
felt
no
jealousy
this
evening
that
for
the
first
time
she
seemed
to
be
thrown
into
the
background
in
her
father
mind
there
was
much
more
talk
before
bedtime
tulliver
naturally
wanted
to
hear
all
the
particulars
of
tom
trading
adventures
and
he
listened
with
growing
excitement
and
delight
he
was
curious
to
know
what
had
been
said
on
every
occasion
if
possible
what
had
been
thought
and
bob
jakin
part
in
the
business
threw
him
into
peculiar
outbursts
of
sympathy
with
the
triumphant
knowingness
of
that
remarkable
packman
bob
juvenile
history
so
far
as
it
had
come
under
tulliver
knowledge
was
recalled
with
that
sense
of
astonishing
promise
it
displayed
which
is
observable
in
all
reminiscences
of
the
childhood
of
great
men
it
was
well
that
there
was
this
interest
of
narrative
to
keep
under
the
vague
but
fierce
sense
of
triumph
over
wakem
which
would
otherwise
have
been
the
channel
his
joy
would
have
rushed
into
with
dangerous
force
even
as
it
was
that
feeling
from
time
to
time
gave
threats
of
its
ultimate
mastery
in
sudden
bursts
of
irrelevant
exclamation
it
was
long
before
tulliver
got
to
sleep
that
night
and
the
sleep
when
it
came
was
filled
with
vivid
dreams
at
five
in
the
morning
when
tulliver
was
already
rising
he
alarmed
her
by
starting
up
with
a
sort
of
smothered
shout
and
looking
round
in
a
bewildered
way
at
the
walls
of
the
bedroom
what
the
matter
mr
tulliver
said
his
wife
he
looked
at
her
still
with
a
puzzled
expression
and
said
at
last
ah
i
was
dreaming
did
i
make
a
noise
i
thought
i
got
hold
of
him
chapter
vii
a
day
of
reckoning
tulliver
was
an
essentially
sober
man
able
to
take
his
glass
and
not
averse
to
it
but
never
exceeding
the
bounds
of
moderation
he
had
naturally
an
active
hotspur
temperament
which
did
not
crave
liquid
fire
to
set
it
aglow
his
impetuosity
was
usually
equal
to
an
exciting
occasion
without
any
such
reinforcements
and
his
desire
for
the
implied
that
the
too
sudden
joy
had
fallen
with
a
dangerous
shock
on
a
frame
depressed
by
four
years
of
gloom
and
unaccustomed
hard
fare
but
that
first
doubtful
tottering
moment
passed
he
seemed
to
gather
strength
with
his
gathering
excitement
and
the
next
day
when
he
was
seated
at
table
with
his
creditors
his
eye
kindling
and
his
cheek
flushed
with
the
consciousness
that
he
was
about
to
make
an
honorable
figure
once
more
he
looked
more
like
the
proud
confident
and
tulliver
of
old
times
than
might
have
seemed
possible
to
any
one
who
had
met
him
a
week
before
riding
along
as
had
been
his
wont
for
the
last
four
years
since
the
sense
of
failure
and
debt
had
been
upon
him
with
his
head
hanging
down
casting
brief
unwilling
looks
on
those
who
forced
themselves
on
his
notice
he
made
his
speech
asserting
his
honest
principles
with
his
old
confident
eagerness
alluding
to
the
rascals
and
the
luck
that
had
been
against
him
but
that
he
had
triumphed
over
to
some
extent
by
hard
efforts
and
the
aid
of
a
good
son
and
winding
up
with
the
story
of
how
tom
had
got
the
best
part
of
the
needful
money
but
the
streak
of
irritation
and
hostile
triumph
seemed
to
melt
for
a
little
while
into
purer
fatherly
pride
and
pleasure
when
tom
health
having
been
proposed
and
uncle
deane
having
taken
occasion
to
say
a
few
words
of
eulogy
on
his
general
character
and
conduct
tom
himself
got
up
and
made
the
single
speech
of
his
life
it
could
hardly
have
been
briefer
he
thanked
the
gentlemen
for
the
honor
they
had
done
him
he
was
glad
that
he
had
been
able
to
help
his
father
in
proving
his
integrity
and
regaining
his
honest
name
and
for
his
own
part
he
hoped
he
should
never
undo
that
work
and
disgrace
that
name
but
the
applause
that
followed
was
so
great
and
tom
looked
so
gentlemanly
as
well
as
tall
and
straight
that
tulliver
remarked
in
an
explanatory
manner
to
his
friends
on
his
right
and
left
that
he
had
spent
a
deal
of
money
on
his
son
education
the
party
broke
up
in
very
sober
fashion
at
five
tom
remained
in
ogg
to
attend
to
some
business
and
tulliver
mounted
his
horse
to
go
home
and
describe
the
memorable
things
that
had
been
said
and
done
to
poor
bessy
and
the
little
wench
the
air
of
excitement
that
hung
about
him
was
but
faintly
due
to
good
cheer
or
any
stimulus
but
the
potent
wine
of
triumphant
joy
he
did
not
choose
any
back
street
but
rode
slowly
with
uplifted
head
and
free
glances
along
the
principal
street
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
why
did
he
not
happen
to
meet
wakem
the
want
of
that
coincidence
vexed
him
and
set
his
mind
at
work
in
an
irritating
way
perhaps
wakem
was
gone
out
of
town
on
purpose
to
avoid
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
an
honorable
action
which
might
well
cause
him
some
unpleasant
twinges
if
wakem
were
to
meet
him
then
tulliver
would
look
straight
at
him
and
the
rascal
would
perhaps
be
forsaken
a
little
by
his
cool
domineering
impudence
he
would
know
by
and
by
that
an
honest
man
was
not
going
to
serve
any
longer
and
lend
his
honesty
to
fill
a
pocket
already
of
dishonest
gains
perhaps
the
luck
was
beginning
to
turn
perhaps
the
devil
always
hold
the
best
cards
in
this
world
simmering
in
this
way
tulliver
approached
the
yardgates
of
dorlcote
mill
near
enough
to
see
a
figure
coming
out
of
them
on
a
fine
black
horse
they
met
about
fifty
yards
from
the
gates
between
the
great
chestnuts
and
elms
and
the
high
bank
tulliver
said
wakem
abruptly
in
a
haughtier
tone
than
usual
what
a
fool
trick
you
did
spreading
those
hard
lumps
on
that
far
close
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
but
you
men
never
learn
to
farm
with
any
method
oh
said
tulliver
suddenly
boiling
up
get
somebody
else
to
farm
for
you
then
as
ask
to
teach
him
you
have
been
drinking
i
suppose
said
wakem
really
believing
that
this
was
the
meaning
of
tulliver
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
no
i
not
been
drinking
said
tulliver
i
want
no
drinking
to
help
me
make
up
my
mind
as
i
serve
no
longer
under
a
scoundrel
very
well
you
may
leave
my
premises
then
hold
your
insolent
tongue
and
let
me
pass
tulliver
was
backing
his
horse
across
the
road
to
hem
wakem
in
no
i
let
you
pass
said
tulliver
getting
fiercer
i
shall
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
first
you
too
big
a
raskill
to
get
hanged
you
let
me
pass
you
ignorant
brute
or
i
ride
over
you
tulliver
spurring
his
horse
and
raising
his
whip
made
a
rush
forward
and
wakem
horse
rearing
and
staggering
backward
threw
his
rider
from
the
saddle
and
sent
him
sideways
on
the
ground
wakem
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
loose
the
bridle
at
once
and
as
the
horse
only
staggered
a
few
paces
and
then
stood
still
he
might
have
risen
and
remounted
without
more
inconvenience
than
a
bruise
and
a
shake
but
before
he
could
rise
tulliver
was
off
his
horse
too
the
sight
of
the
predominant
man
down
and
in
his
power
threw
him
into
a
frenzy
of
triumphant
vengeance
which
seemed
to
give
him
preternatural
agility
and
strength
he
rushed
on
wakem
who
was
in
the
act
of
trying
to
recover
his
feet
grasped
him
by
the
left
arm
so
as
to
press
wakem
whole
weight
on
the
right
arm
which
rested
on
the
ground
and
flogged
him
fiercely
across
the
back
with
his
wakem
shouted
for
help
but
no
help
came
until
a
woman
scream
was
heard
and
the
cry
of
father
father
suddenly
wakem
felt
something
had
arrested
tulliver
arm
for
the
flogging
ceased
and
the
grasp
on
his
own
arm
was
relaxed
get
away
with
you
go
said
tulliver
angrily
but
it
was
not
to
wakem
that
he
spoke
slowly
the
lawyer
rose
and
as
he
turned
his
head
saw
that
tulliver
arms
were
being
held
by
a
girl
rather
by
the
fear
of
hurting
the
girl
that
clung
to
him
with
all
her
young
might
oh
luke
mother
come
and
help
mr
wakem
maggie
cried
as
she
heard
the
footsteps
help
me
on
to
that
low
horse
said
wakem
to
luke
then
i
shall
perhaps
manage
though
confound
it
i
think
this
arm
is
sprained
with
some
difficulty
wakem
was
heaved
on
to
tulliver
horse
then
he
turned
toward
the
miller
and
said
with
white
rage
you
suffer
for
this
sir
your
daughter
is
a
witness
that
you
assaulted
me
i
do
care
said
tulliver
in
a
thick
fierce
voice
go
and
show
your
back
and
tell
i
thrashed
you
tell
i
made
things
a
bit
more
even
i
the
world
ride
my
horse
home
with
me
said
wakem
to
luke
by
the
tofton
ferry
not
through
the
town
father
come
in
said
maggie
imploringly
then
seeing
that
wakem
had
ridden
off
and
that
no
further
violence
was
possible
she
slackened
her
hold
and
burst
into
hysteric
sobs
while
poor
tulliver
stood
by
in
silence
quivering
with
fear
but
maggie
became
conscious
that
as
she
was
slackening
her
hold
her
father
was
beginning
to
grasp
her
and
lean
on
her
the
surprise
checked
her
sobs
i
feel
ill
faintish
he
said
help
me
in
bessy
i
giddy
i
a
pain
i
the
head
he
walked
in
slowly
propped
by
his
wife
and
daughter
and
tottered
into
his
the
almost
purple
flush
had
given
way
to
paleness
and
his
hand
was
cold
had
we
better
send
for
the
doctor
said
tulliver
he
seemed
to
be
too
faint
and
suffering
to
hear
her
but
presently
when
she
said
to
maggie
go
and
seek
for
somebody
to
fetch
the
doctor
he
looked
up
at
her
with
full
comprehension
and
said
doctor
no
no
doctor
it
my
head
that
all
help
me
to
bed
sad
ending
to
the
day
that
had
risen
on
them
all
like
a
beginning
of
better
times
but
mingled
seed
must
bear
a
mingled
crop
in
half
an
hour
after
his
father
had
lain
down
tom
came
home
bob
jakin
was
with
him
come
to
congratulate
the
old
master
not
without
some
excusable
pride
that
he
had
had
his
share
in
bringing
about
tom
good
luck
and
tom
had
thought
his
father
would
like
nothing
better
as
a
finish
to
the
day
than
a
talk
with
bob
but
now
tom
could
only
spend
the
evening
in
gloomy
expectation
of
the
unpleasant
consequences
that
must
follow
on
this
mad
outbreak
of
his
hate
after
the
painful
news
had
been
told
he
sat
in
silence
he
had
not
spirit
or
inclination
to
tell
his
mother
and
sister
anything
about
the
dinner
they
hardly
cared
to
ask
it
apparently
the
mingled
thread
in
the
web
of
their
life
was
so
curiously
twisted
together
that
there
could
be
no
joy
without
a
sorrow
coming
close
upon
it
tom
was
dejected
by
the
thought
that
his
exemplary
effort
must
always
be
baffled
by
the
of
others
maggie
was
living
through
over
and
over
again
the
agony
of
the
moment
in
which
she
had
rushed
to
throw
herself
on
her
father
arm
with
a
vague
shuddering
foreboding
of
wretched
scenes
to
come
not
one
of
the
three
felt
any
particular
alarm
about
health
the
symptoms
did
not
recall
his
former
dangerous
attack
and
it
seemed
only
a
necessary
consequence
that
his
violent
passion
and
effort
of
strength
after
many
hours
of
unusual
excitement
should
have
made
him
feel
rest
would
probably
cure
him
tom
tired
out
by
his
active
day
fell
asleep
soon
and
slept
soundly
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
only
just
come
to
bed
when
he
waked
to
see
his
mother
standing
by
him
in
the
gray
light
of
early
morning
my
boy
you
must
get
up
this
minute
i
sent
for
the
doctor
and
your
father
wants
you
and
maggie
to
come
to
him
is
he
worse
mother
he
been
very
ill
all
night
with
his
head
but
he
does
say
worse
he
only
said
suddenly
fetch
the
boy
and
girl
tell
to
make
haste
maggie
and
tom
threw
on
their
clothes
hastily
in
the
chill
gray
light
and
reached
their
father
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
was
watching
for
them
with
an
expression
of
pain
on
his
brow
but
with
sharpened
anxious
consciousness
in
his
eyes
tulliver
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
frightened
and
trembling
looking
worn
and
aged
from
disturbed
rest
maggie
was
at
the
bedside
first
but
her
glance
was
toward
tom
who
came
and
stood
next
to
her
tom
my
lad
it
come
upon
me
as
i
get
up
again
this
world
been
too
many
for
me
my
lad
but
you

what
you
could
to
make
things
a
bit
even
shake
hands
wi
me
again
my
lad
before
i
go
away
from
you
the
father
and
son
clasped
hands
and
looked
at
each
other
an
instant
then
tom
said
trying
to
speak
firmly
have
you
any
wish
father
that
i
can
fulfil
when
ay
my
lad
you
try
and
get
the
old
mill
back
yes
father
and
there
your
mother
you
try
and
make
her
amends
all
you
can
for
my
bad
luck
and
there
the
little
wench
the
father
turned
his
eyes
on
maggie
with
a
still
more
eager
look
while
she
with
a
bursting
heart
sank
on
her
knees
to
be
closer
to
the
dear
face
which
had
been
present
with
her
through
long
years
as
the
sign
of
her
deepest
love
and
hardest
trial
you
must
take
care
of
her
tom
do
you
fret
my
wench
come
somebody
as
love
you
and
take
your
part
and
you
must
be
good
to
her
my
lad
i
was
good
to
sister
kiss
me
come
you
manage
to
pay
for
a
brick
grave
tom
so
as
your
mother
and
me
can
lie
together
he
looked
away
from
them
all
when
he
had
said
this
and
lay
silent
for
some
minutes
while
they
stood
watching
him
not
daring
to
move
the
morning
light
was
growing
clearer
for
them
and
they
could
see
the
heaviness
gathering
in
his
face
and
the
dulness
in
his
eyes
but
at
last
he
looked
toward
tom
and
said
i
had
my
turn
i
beat
him
that
was
nothing
but
fair
i
never
wanted
anything
but
what
was
fair
but
father
dear
father
said
maggie
an
unspeakable
anxiety
predominating
over
her
grief
you
forgive
him
you
forgive
every
one
now
he
did
not
move
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
but
he
said
no
my
wench
i
do
forgive
him
what
forgiving
to
do
i
love
a
raskill
his
voice
had
become
thicker
but
he
wanted
to
say
more
and
moved
his
lips
again
and
again
struggling
in
vain
to
speak
at
length
the
words
forced
their
way
does
god
forgive
raskills
but
if
he
does
he
wo
be
hard
wi
me
his
hands
moved
uneasily
as
if
he
wanted
them
to
remove
some
obstruction
that
weighed
upon
him
two
or
three
times
there
fell
from
him
some
broken
words
this
world
too
many
honest
man
puzzling
soon
they
merged
into
mere
mutterings
the
eyes
had
ceased
to
discern
and
then
came
the
final
silence
but
not
of
death
for
an
hour
or
more
the
chest
heaved
the
loud
hard
breathing
continued
getting
gradually
slower
as
the
cold
dews
gathered
on
the
brow
at
last
there
was
total
stillness
and
poor
tulliver
dimly
lighted
soul
had
forever
ceased
to
be
vexed
with
the
painful
riddle
of
this
world
help
was
come
now
luke
and
his
wife
were
there
and
turnbull
had
arrived
too
late
for
everything
but
to
say
this
is
death
tom
and
maggie
went
downstairs
together
into
the
room
where
their
father
place
was
empty
their
eyes
turned
to
the
same
spot
and
maggie
spoke
tom
forgive
me
let
us
always
love
each
other
and
they
clung
and
wept
together

of
course
lucy

and
the
fine
young
man
who
is
leaning
down
from

chair
to
snap
the
scissors
in
the
extremely
abbreviated
face
of

lying
on

than
stephen

whose
diamond
ring
attar
of
roses
and
air
of
leisure
at
twelve
in
the
day
are
the
graceful
and
odoriferous
result
of
the
largest
and
the
most
extensive
wharf
in
ogg
there
is
an
apparent
triviality
in
the
action
with
the
scissors
but
your
discernment
perceives
at
once
that
there
is
a
design
in
it
which
makes
it
eminently
worthy
of
a
young
man
for
you
see
that
lucy
wants
the
scissors
and
is
compelled
reluctant
as
she
may
be
to
shake
her
ringlets
back
raise
her
soft
hazel
eyes
smile
playfully
down
on
the
face
that
is
so
very
nearly
on
a
level
with
her
knee
and
holding
out
her
little
palm
to
say
my
scissors
please
if
you
can
renounce
the
great
pleasure
of
persecuting
my
poor
minny
the
foolish
scissors
have
slipped
too
far
over
the
knuckles
it
seems
and
hercules
holds
out
his
entrapped
fingers
hopelessly
confound
the
scissors
the
oval
lies
the
wrong
way
please
draw
them
off
for
me
draw
them
off
with
your
other
hand
says
miss
lucy
roguishly
oh
but
that
my
left
hand
i
not
lucy
laughs
and
the
scissors
are
drawn
off
with
gentle
touches
from
tiny
tips
which
naturally
dispose
stephen
for
a
repetition
accordingly
he
watches
for
the
release
of
the
scissors
that
he
may
get
them
into
his
possession
again
no
no
said
lucy
sticking
them
in
her
band
you
shall
not
have
my
scissors
again
you
have
strained
them
already
now
do
set
minny
growling
again
sit
up
and
behave
properly
and
then
i
will
tell
you
some
news
what
is
that
said
stephen
throwing
himself
back
and
hanging
his
right
arm
over
the
corner
of
his
chair
he
might
have
been
sitting
for
his
portrait
which
would
have
represented
a
rather
striking
young
man
of
with
a
square
forehead
short
hair
standing
erect
with
a
slight
wave
at
the
end
like
a
thick
crop
of
corn
and
a
glance
from
under
his
horizontal
eyebrows
is
it
very
important
news
yes
very
guess
you
are
going
to
change
minny
diet
and
give
him
three
ratafias
soaked
in
a
of
cream
daily
quite
wrong
well
then
kenn
has
been
preaching
against
buckram
and
you
ladies
have
all
been
sending
him
a
roundrobin
saying
is
a
hard
doctrine
who
can
bear
it
for
shame
said
lucy
adjusting
her
little
mouth
gravely
it
is
rather
dull
of
you
not
to
guess
my
news
because
it
is
about
something
i
mentioned
to
you
not
very
long
ago
but
you
have
mentioned
many
things
to
me
not
long
ago
does
your
feminine
tyranny
require
that
when
you
say
the
thing
you
mean
is
one
of
several
things
i
should
know
it
immediately
by
that
mark
yes
i
know
you
think
i
am
silly
i
think
you
are
perfectly
charming
and
my
silliness
is
part
of
my
charm
i
did
say
but
i
know
you
like
women
to
be
rather
insipid
philip
wakem
betrayed
you
he
said
so
one
day
when
you
were
not
here
oh
i
know
phil
is
fierce
on
that
point
he
makes
it
quite
a
personal
matter
i
think
he
must
be
for
some
unknown
lady
some
exalted
beatrice
whom
he
met
abroad
by
the
by
said
lucy
pausing
in
her
work
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
i
never
found
out
whether
my
cousin
maggie
will
object
to
see
philip
as
her
brother
does
tom
will
not
enter
a
room
where
philip
is
if
he
knows
it
perhaps
maggie
may
be
the
same
and
then
we
be
able
to
sing
our
glees
shall
we
what
is
your
cousin
coming
to
stay
with
you
said
stephen
with
a
look
of
slight
annoyance
yes
that
was
my
news
which
you
have
forgotten
she
going
to
leave
her
situation
where
she
has
been
nearly
two
years
poor
thing
ever
since
her
father
death
and
she
will
stay
with
me
a
month
or
two
many
months
i
hope
and
am
i
bound
to
be
pleased
at
that
news
oh
no
not
at
all
said
lucy
with
a
little
air
of
pique
am
pleased
but
that
of
course
is
no
reason
why
should
be
pleased
there
is
no
girl
in
the
world
i
love
so
well
as
my
cousin
maggie
and
you
will
be
inseparable
i
suppose
when
she
comes
there
will
be
no
possibility
of
a
with
you
any
more
unless
you
can
find
an
admirer
for
her
who
will
pair
off
with
her
occasionally
what
is
the
ground
of
dislike
to
philip
he
might
have
been
a
resource
it
is
a
family
quarrel
with
philip
father
there
were
very
painful
circumstances
i
believe
i
never
quite
understood
them
or
knew
them
all
my
uncle
tulliver
was
unfortunate
and
lost
all
his
property
and
i
think
he
considered
wakem
was
somehow
the
cause
of
it
wakem
bought
dorlcote
mill
my
uncle
old
place
where
he
always
lived
you
must
remember
my
uncle
tulliver
do
you
no
said
stephen
with
rather
supercilious
indifference
always
known
the
name
and
i
dare
say
i
knew
the
man
by
sight
apart
from
his
name
i
know
half
the
names
and
faces
in
the
neighborhood
in
that
detached
disjointed
way
he
was
a
very
man
i
remember
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
used
to
go
to
see
my
cousins
he
often
frightened
me
by
talking
as
if
he
were
angry
papa
told
me
there
was
a
dreadful
quarrel
the
very
day
before
my
uncle
death
between
him
and
wakem
but
it
was
hushed
up
that
was
when
you
were
in
london
papa
says
my
uncle
was
quite
mistaken
in
many
ways
his
mind
had
become
embittered
but
tom
and
maggie
must
naturally
feel
it
very
painful
to
be
reminded
of
these
things
they
have
had
so
much
so
very
much
trouble
maggie
was
at
school
with
me
six
years
ago
when
she
was
fetched
away
because
of
her
father
misfortunes
and
she
has
hardly
had
any
pleasure
since
i
think
she
has
been
in
a
dreary
situation
in
a
school
since
death
because
she
is
determined
to
be
independent
and
not
live
with
aunt
pullet
and
i
could
hardly
wish
her
to
come
to
me
then
because
dear
mamma
was
ill
and
everything
was
so
sad
that
is
why
i
want
her
to
come
to
me
now
and
have
a
long
long
holiday
very
sweet
and
angelic
of
you
said
stephen
looking
at
her
with
an
admiring
smile
and
all
the
more
so
if
she
has
the
conversational
qualities
of
her
mother
poor
aunty
you
are
cruel
to
ridicule
her
she
is
very
valuable
to
i
know
she
manages
the
house
beautifully
much
better
than
any
stranger
would
and
she
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
illness
yes
but
in
point
of
companionship
one
would
prefer
that
she
should
be
represented
by
her
and
i
think
with
a
shudder
that
her
daughter
will
always
be
present
in
person
and
have
no
agreeable
proxies
of
that
kind
a
fat
blond
girl
with
round
blue
eyes
who
will
stare
at
us
silently
oh
yes
exclaimed
lucy
laughing
wickedly
and
clapping
her
hands
that
is
just
my
cousin
maggie
you
must
have
seen
her
no
indeed
i
only
guessing
what
tulliver
daughter
must
be
and
then
if
she
is
to
banish
philip
our
only
apology
for
a
tenor
that
will
be
an
additional
bore
but
i
hope
that
may
not
be
i
think
i
will
ask
you
to
call
on
philip
and
tell
him
maggie
is
coming
he
is
quite
aware
of
feeling
and
always
keeps
out
of
his
way
so
he
will
understand
if
you
tell
him
that
i
asked
you
to
warn
him
not
to
come
until
i
write
to
ask
him
i
think
you
had
better
write
a
pretty
note
for
me
to
take
phil
is
so
sensitive
you
know
the
least
thing
might
frighten
him
off
coming
at
all
and
we
had
hard
work
to
get
him
i
can
never
induce
him
to
come
to
the
park
he
does
like
my
sisters
i
think
it
is
only
your
faëry
touch
that
can
lay
his
ruffled
feathers
stephen
mastered
the
little
hand
that
was
straying
toward
the
table
and
touched
it
lightly
with
his
lips
little
lucy
felt
very
proud
and
happy
she
and
stephen
were
in
that
stage
of
courtship
which
makes
the
most
exquisite
moment
of
youth
the
freshest
of
passion
when
each
is
sure
of
the
other
love
but
no
formal
declaration
has
been
made
and
all
is
mutual
divination
exalting
the
most
trivial
word
the
lightest
gesture
into
thrills
delicate
and
delicious
as
wafted
jasmine
scent
the
explicitness
of
an
engagement
wears
off
this
finest
edge
of
susceptibility
it
is
jasmine
gathered
and
presented
in
a
large
bouquet
but
it
is
really
odd
that
you
should
have
hit
so
exactly
on
appearance
and
manners
said
the
cunning
lucy
moving
to
reach
her
desk
because
she
might
have
been
like
her
brother
you
know
and
tom
has
not
round
eyes
and
he
is
as
far
as
possible
from
staring
at
people
oh
i
suppose
he
is
like
the
father
he
seems
to
be
as
proud
as
lucifer
not
a
brilliant
companion
though
i
should
think
i
like
tom
he
gave
me
my
minny
when
i
lost
lolo
and
papa
is
very
fond
of
him
he
says
tom
has
excellent
principles
it
was
through
him
that
his
father
was
able
to
pay
all
his
debts
before
he
died
oh
ah
i
heard
about
that
i
heard
your
father
and
mine
talking
about
it
a
little
while
ago
after
dinner
in
one
of
their
interminable
discussions
about
business
they
think
of
doing
something
for
young
tulliver
he
saved
them
from
a
considerable
loss
by
riding
home
in
some
marvellous
way
like
turpin
to
bring
them
news
about
the
stoppage
of
a
bank
or
something
of
that
sort
but
i
was
rather
drowsy
at
the
time
stephen
rose
from
his
seat
and
sauntered
to
the
piano
humming
in
falsetto
graceful
consort
as
he
turned
over
the
volume
of
the
creation
which
stood
open
on
the
desk
come
and
sing
this
he
said
when
he
saw
lucy
rising
what
consort
i
do
think
it
suits
your
voice
never
mind
it
exactly
suits
my
feeling
which
philip
will
have
it
is
the
grand
element
of
good
singing
i
notice
men
with
indifferent
voices
are
usually
of
that
opinion
philip
burst
into
one
of
his
invectives
against
creation
the
other
day
said
lucy
seating
herself
at
the
piano
he
says
it
has
a
sort
of
sugared
complacency
and
flattering
in
it
as
if
it
were
written
for
the
birthday
of
a
german
oh
pooh
he
is
the
fallen
adam
with
a
soured
temper
we
are
adam
and
eve
unfallen
in
paradise
now
then
the
recitative
for
the
sake
of
the
moral
you
will
sing
the
whole
duty
of
woman
from
obedience
grows
my
pride
and
happiness
oh
no
i
shall
not
respect
an
adam
who
drags
the
as
you
will
said
lucy
beginning
to
play
the
duet
surely
the
only
courtship
unshaken
by
doubts
and
fears
must
be
that
in
which
the
lovers
can
sing
together
the
sense
of
mutual
fitness
that
springs
from
the
two
deep
notes
fulfilling
expectation
just
at
the
right
moment
between
the
notes
of
the
silvery
soprano
from
the
perfect
accord
of
descending
thirds
and
fifths
from
the
preconcerted
loving
chase
of
a
fugue
is
likely
enough
to
supersede
any
immediate
demand
for
less
impassioned
forms
of
agreement
the
contralto
will
not
care
to
catechise
the
bass
the
tenor
will
foresee
no
embarrassing
dearth
of
remark
in
evenings
spent
with
the
lovely
soprano
in
the
provinces
too
where
music
was
so
scarce
in
that
remote
time
how
could
the
musical
people
avoid
falling
in
love
with
each
other
even
political
principle
must
have
been
in
danger
of
relaxation
under
such
circumstances
and
the
violin
faithful
to
rotten
boroughs
must
have
been
tempted
to
fraternize
in
a
demoralizing
way
with
a
reforming
violoncello
in
that
case
the
soprano
and
the
bass
singing
with
thee
delight
is
ever
new
with
thee
is
life
incessant
bliss
believed
what
they
sang
all
the
more
they
sang
it
now
for
raphael
great
song
said
lucy
when
they
had
finished
the
duet
you
do
the
beasts
to
perfection
that
sounds
complimentary
said
stephen
looking
at
his
watch
by
jove
it
nearly
one
well
i
can
just
sing
this
stephen
delivered
with
admirable
ease
the
deep
notes
representing
the
tread
of
the
heavy
beasts
but
when
a
singer
has
an
audience
of
two
there
is
room
for
divided
sentiments
minny
mistress
was
charmed
but
minny
who
had
intrenched
himself
trembling
in
his
basket
as
soon
as
the
music
began
found
this
thunder
so
little
to
his
taste
that
he
leaped
out
and
scampered
under
the
remotest
as
the
most
eligible
place
in
which
a
small
dog
could
await
the
crack
of
doom
adieu
consort
said
stephen
buttoning
his
coat
across
when
he
had
done
singing
and
smiling
down
from
his
tall
height
with
the
air
of
rather
a
patronizing
lover
at
the
little
lady
on
the
my
bliss
is
not
incessant
for
i
must
gallop
home
i
promised
to
be
there
at
lunch
you
will
not
be
able
to
call
on
philip
then
it
is
of
no
consequence
i
have
said
everything
in
my
note
you
will
be
engaged
with
your
cousin
i
suppose
yes
we
are
going
to
have
a
little
my
cousin
tom
will
dine
with
us
and
poor
aunty
will
have
her
two
children
together
for
the
first
time
it
will
be
very
pretty
i
think
a
great
deal
about
it
but
i
may
come
the
next
day
oh
yes
come
and
be
introduced
to
my
cousin
maggie
though
you
can
hardly
be
said
not
to
have
seen
her
you
have
described
her
so
well
then
and
there
was
that
slight
pressure
of
the
hands
and
momentary
meeting
of
the
eyes
which
will
often
leave
a
little
lady
with
a
slight
flush
and
smile
on
her
face
that
do
not
subside
immediately
when
the
door
is
closed
and
with
an
inclination
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
rather
than
to
seat
herself
quietly
at
her
embroidery
or
other
rational
and
improving
occupation
at
least
this
was
the
effect
on
lucy
and
you
will
not
i
hope
consider
it
an
indication
of
vanity
predominating
over
more
tender
impulses
that
she
just
glanced
in
the
as
her
walk
brought
her
near
it
the
desire
to
know
that
one
has
not
looked
an
absolute
fright
during
a
few
hours
of
conversation
may
be
construed
as
lying
within
the
bounds
of
a
laudable
benevolent
consideration
for
others
and
lucy
had
so
much
of
this
benevolence
in
her
nature
that
i
am
inclined
to
think
her
small
egoisms
were
impregnated
with
it
just
as
there
are
people
not
altogether
unknown
to
you
whose
small
benevolences
have
a
predominant
and
somewhat
rank
odor
of
egoism
even
now
that
she
is
walking
up
and
down
with
a
little
triumphant
flutter
of
her
girlish
heart
at
the
sense
that
she
is
loved
by
the
person
of
chief
consequence
in
her
small
world
you
may
see
in
her
hazel
eyes
an
sunny
benignity
in
which
the
momentary
harmless
flashes
of
personal
vanity
are
quite
lost
and
if
she
is
happy
in
thinking
of
her
lover
it
is
because
the
thought
of
him
mingles
readily
with
all
the
gentle
affections
and
offices
with
which
she
fills
her
peaceful
days
even
now
her
mind
with
that
instantaneous
alternation
which
makes
two
currents
of
feeling
or
imagination
seem
simultaneous
is
glancing
continually
from
stephen
to
the
preparations
she
has
only
half
finished
in
maggie
room
cousin
maggie
should
be
treated
as
well
as
the
grandest
nay
better
for
she
should
have
lucy
best
prints
and
drawings
in
her
bedroom
and
the
very
finest
bouquet
of
spring
flowers
on
her
table
maggie
would
enjoy
all
that
she
was
so
found
of
pretty
things
and
there
was
poor
aunt
tulliver
that
no
one
made
any
account
of
she
was
to
be
surprised
with
the
present
of
a
cap
of
superlative
quality
and
to
have
her
health
drunk
in
a
gratifying
manner
for
which
lucy
was
going
to
lay
a
plot
with
her
father
this
evening
clearly
she
had
not
time
to
indulge
in
long
reveries
about
her
own
happy
with
this
thought
she
walked
toward
the
door
but
paused
there
what
the
matter
then
minny
she
said
stooping
in
answer
to
some
whimpering
of
that
small
quadruped
and
lifting
his
glossy
head
against
her
pink
cheek
did
you
think
i
was
going
without
you
come
then
let
us
go
and
see
sinbad
sinbad
was
lucy
chestnut
horse
that
she
always
fed
with
her
own
hand
when
he
was
turned
out
in
the
paddock
she
was
fond
of
feeding
dependent
creatures
and
knew
the
private
tastes
of
all
the
animals
about
the
house
delighting
in
the
little
rippling
sounds
of
her
canaries
when
their
beaks
were
busy
with
fresh
seed
and
in
the
small
nibbling
pleasures
of
certain
animals
which
lest
she
should
appear
too
trivial
i
will
here
call
the
more
familiar
rodents
was
not
stephen
guest
right
in
his
decided
opinion
that
this
slim
maiden
of
eighteen
was
quite
the
sort
of
wife
a
man
would
not
be
likely
to
repent
of
marrying
a
woman
who
was
loving
and
thoughtful
for
other
women
not
giving
them
with
eyes
askance
on
their
welcome
defects
but
with
real
care
and
vision
for
their
pains
and
mortifications
with
long
ruminating
enjoyment
of
little
pleasures
prepared
for
them
perhaps
the
emphasis
of
his
admiration
did
not
fall
precisely
on
this
rarest
quality
in
her
perhaps
he
approved
his
own
choice
of
her
chiefly
because
she
did
not
strike
him
as
a
remarkable
rarity
a
man
likes
his
wife
to
be
pretty
well
lucy
was
pretty
but
not
to
a
maddening
extent
a
man
likes
his
wife
to
be
accomplished
gentle
affectionate
and
not
stupid
and
lucy
had
all
these
qualifications
stephen
was
not
surprised
to
find
himself
in
love
with
her
and
was
conscious
of
excellent
judgment
in
preferring
her
to
miss
leyburn
the
daughter
of
the
county
member
although
lucy
was
only
the
daughter
of
his
father
subordinate
partner
besides
he
had
had
to
defy
and
overcome
a
slight
unwillingness
and
disappointment
in
his
father
and
sisters
a
circumstance
which
gives
a
young
man
an
agreeable
consciousness
of
his
own
dignity
stephen
was
aware
that
he
had
sense
and
independence
enough
to
choose
the
wife
who
was
likely
to
make
him
happy
unbiassed
by
any
indirect
considerations
he
meant
to
choose
lucy
she
was
a
little
darling
and
exactly
the
sort
of
woman
he
had
always
admired
chapter
ii
first
impressions
he
is
very
clever
maggie
said
lucy
she
was
kneeling
on
a
footstool
at
maggie
feet
after
placing
that
dark
lady
in
the
large
chair
i
feel
sure
you
will
like
him
i
hope
you
will
i
shall
be
very
difficult
to
please
said
maggie
smiling
and
holding
up
one
of
lucy
long
curls
that
the
sunlight
might
shine
through
it
a
gentleman
who
thinks
he
is
good
enough
for
lucy
must
expect
to
be
sharply
criticised
indeed
he
a
great
deal
too
good
for
me
and
sometimes
when
he
is
away
i
almost
think
it
ca
really
be
that
he
loves
me
but
i
can
never
doubt
it
when
he
is
with
me
though
i
could
bear
any
one
but
you
to
know
that
i
feel
in
that
way
maggie
oh
then
if
i
disapprove
of
him
you
can
give
him
up
since
you
are
not
engaged
said
maggie
with
playful
gravity
i
would
rather
not
be
engaged
when
people
are
engaged
they
begin
to
think
of
being
married
soon
said
lucy
too
thoroughly
preoccupied
to
notice
maggie
joke
and
i
should
like
everything
to
go
on
for
a
long
while
just
as
it
is
sometimes
i
am
quite
frightened
lest
stephen
should
say
that
he
has
spoken
to
papa
and
from
something
that
fell
from
papa
the
other
day
i
feel
sure
he
and
mr
guest
are
expecting
that
and
stephen
sisters
are
very
civil
to
me
now
at
first
i
think
they
did
like
his
paying
me
attention
and
that
was
natural
it
seem
out
of
keeping
that
i
should
ever
live
in
a
great
place
like
the
park
house
such
a
little
insignificant
thing
as
i
am
but
people
are
not
expected
to
be
large
in
proportion
to
the
houses
they
live
in
like
snails
said
maggie
laughing
pray
are
mr
guest
sisters
giantesses
oh
no
and
not
handsome
that
is
not
very
said
lucy
at
this
uncharitable
remark
but
is
at
least
he
is
generally
considered
very
handsome
though
you
are
unable
to
share
that
opinion
oh
i
do
know
said
lucy
blushing
pink
over
brow
and
neck
it
is
a
bad
plan
to
raise
expectation
you
will
perhaps
be
disappointed
but
i
have
prepared
a
charming
surprise
for
i
shall
have
a
glorious
laugh
against
him
i
shall
not
tell
you
what
it
is
though
lucy
rose
from
her
knees
and
went
to
a
little
distance
holding
her
pretty
head
on
one
side
as
if
she
had
been
arranging
maggie
for
a
portrait
and
wished
to
judge
of
the
general
effect
stand
up
a
moment
maggie
what
is
your
pleasure
now
said
maggie
smiling
languidly
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
looked
down
on
her
slight
aerial
cousin
whose
figure
was
quite
subordinate
to
her
faultless
drapery
of
silk
and
crape
lucy
kept
her
contemplative
attitude
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
and
then
said
i
ca
think
what
witchery
it
is
in
you
maggie
that
makes
you
look
best
in
shabby
clothes
though
you
really
must
have
a
new
dress
now
but
do
you
know
last
night
i
was
trying
to
fancy
you
in
a
handsome
fashionable
dress
and
do
what
i
would
that
old
limp
merino
would
come
back
as
the
only
right
thing
for
you
i
wonder
if
marie
antoinette
looked
all
the
grander
when
her
gown
was
darned
at
the
elbows
now
if
were
to
put
anything
shabby
on
i
should
be
quite
unnoticeable
i
should
be
a
mere
rag
oh
quite
said
maggie
with
mock
gravity
you
would
be
liable
to
be
swept
out
of
the
room
with
the
cobwebs
and
and
to
find
yourself
under
the
grate
like
cinderella
may
i
sit
down
now
yes
now
you
may
said
lucy
laughing
then
with
an
air
of
serious
reflection
unfastening
her
large
jet
brooch
but
you
must
change
brooches
maggie
that
little
butterfly
looks
silly
on
you
but
wo
that
mar
the
charming
effect
of
my
consistent
shabbiness
said
maggie
seating
herself
submissively
while
lucy
knelt
again
and
unfastened
the
contemptible
butterfly
i
wish
my
mother
were
of
your
opinion
for
she
was
fretting
last
night
because
this
is
my
best
frock
i
been
saving
my
money
to
pay
for
some
lessons
i
shall
never
get
a
better
situation
without
more
accomplishments
maggie
gave
a
little
sigh
now
do
put
on
that
sad
look
again
said
lucy
pinning
the
large
brooch
below
maggie
fine
throat
you
forgetting
that
you
left
that
dreary
schoolroom
behind
you
and
have
no
little
girls
clothes
to
mend
yes
said
maggie
it
is
with
me
as
i
used
to
think
it
would
be
with
the
poor
uneasy
white
bear
i
saw
at
the
show
i
thought
he
must
have
got
so
stupid
with
the
habit
of
turning
backward
and
forward
in
that
narrow
space
that
he
would
keep
doing
it
if
they
set
him
free
one
gets
a
bad
habit
of
being
unhappy
but
i
shall
put
you
under
a
discipline
of
pleasure
that
will
make
you
lose
that
bad
habit
said
lucy
sticking
the
black
butterfly
absently
in
her
own
collar
while
her
eyes
met
maggie
affectionately
you
dear
tiny
thing
said
maggie
in
one
of
her
bursts
of
loving
admiration
you
enjoy
other
people
happiness
so
much
i
believe
you
would
do
without
any
of
your
own
i
wish
i
were
like
you
i
never
been
tried
in
that
way
said
lucy
i
always
been
so
happy
i
do
know
whether
i
could
bear
much
trouble
i
never
had
any
but
poor
mamma
death
you
been
tried
maggie
and
i
sure
you
feel
for
other
people
quite
as
much
as
i
do
no
lucy
said
maggie
shaking
her
head
slowly
i
do
enjoy
their
happiness
as
you
do
else
i
should
be
more
contented
i
do
feel
for
them
when
they
are
in
trouble
i
do
think
i
could
ever
bear
to
make
any
one
and
yet
i
often
hate
myself
because
i
get
angry
sometimes
at
the
sight
of
happy
people
i
think
i
get
worse
as
i
get
older
more
selfish
that
seems
very
dreadful
now
maggie
said
lucy
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
i
do
believe
a
word
of
that
it
is
all
a
gloomy
fancy
just
because
you
are
depressed
by
a
dull
wearisome
life
well
perhaps
it
is
said
maggie
resolutely
clearing
away
the
clouds
from
her
face
with
a
bright
smile
and
throwing
herself
backward
in
her
chair
perhaps
it
comes
from
the
school
diet
watery
spiced
with
pinnock
let
us
hope
it
will
give
way
before
my
mother
custards
and
this
charming
geoffrey
crayon
maggie
took
up
the
sketch
book
which
lay
by
her
on
the
table
do
i
look
fit
to
be
seen
with
this
little
brooch
said
lucy
going
to
survey
the
effect
in
the
oh
no
mr
guest
will
be
obliged
to
go
out
of
the
room
again
if
he
sees
you
in
it
pray
make
haste
and
put
another
on
lucy
hurried
out
of
the
room
but
maggie
did
not
take
the
opportunity
of
opening
her
book
she
let
it
fall
on
her
knees
while
her
eyes
wandered
to
the
window
where
she
could
see
the
sunshine
falling
on
the
rich
clumps
of
spring
flowers
and
on
the
long
hedge
of
laurels
and
beyond
the
silvery
breadth
of
the
dear
old
floss
that
at
this
distance
seemed
to
be
sleeping
in
a
morning
holiday
the
sweet
fresh
came
through
the
open
window
and
the
birds
were
busy
flitting
and
alighting
gurgling
and
singing
yet
maggie
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
the
sight
of
the
old
scenes
had
made
the
rush
of
memories
so
painful
that
even
yesterday
she
had
only
been
able
to
rejoice
in
her
mother
restored
comfort
and
tom
brotherly
friendliness
as
we
rejoice
in
good
news
of
friends
at
a
distance
rather
than
in
the
presence
of
a
happiness
which
we
share
memory
and
imagination
urged
upon
her
a
sense
of
privation
too
keen
to
let
her
taste
what
was
offered
in
the
transient
present
her
future
she
thought
was
likely
to
be
worse
than
her
past
for
after
her
years
of
contented
renunciation
she
had
slipped
back
into
desire
and
longing
she
found
joyless
days
of
distasteful
occupation
harder
and
harder
she
found
the
image
of
the
intense
and
varied
life
she
yearned
for
and
despaired
of
becoming
more
and
more
importunate
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
roused
her
and
hastily
wiping
away
her
tears
she
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
of
her
book
there
is
one
pleasure
i
know
maggie
that
your
deepest
dismalness
will
never
resist
said
lucy
beginning
to
speak
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
that
is
music
and
i
mean
you
to
have
quite
a
riotous
feast
of
it
i
mean
you
to
get
up
your
playing
again
which
used
to
be
so
much
better
than
mine
when
we
were
at
laceham
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
me
playing
the
little
girls
tunes
over
and
over
to
them
when
i
took
them
to
practise
said
maggie
just
for
the
sake
of
fingering
the
dear
keys
again
but
i
do
know
whether
i
could
play
anything
more
difficult
now
than
dull
care
i
know
what
a
wild
state
of
joy
you
used
to
be
in
when
the
came
round
said
lucy
taking
up
her
embroidery
and
we
might
have
all
those
old
glees
that
you
used
to
love
so
if
i
were
certain
that
you
do
feel
exactly
as
tom
does
about
some
things
i
should
have
thought
there
was
nothing
you
might
be
more
certain
of
said
maggie
smiling
i
ought
rather
to
have
said
one
particular
thing
because
if
you
feel
just
as
he
does
about
that
we
shall
want
our
third
voice
ogg
is
so
miserably
provided
with
musical
gentlemen
there
are
really
only
stephen
and
philip
wakem
who
have
any
knowledge
of
music
so
as
to
be
able
to
sing
a
part
lucy
had
looked
up
from
her
work
as
she
uttered
the
last
sentence
and
saw
that
there
was
a
change
in
maggie
face
does
it
hurt
you
to
hear
the
name
mentioned
maggie
if
it
does
i
will
not
speak
of
him
again
i
know
tom
will
not
see
him
if
he
can
avoid
it
i
do
feel
at
all
as
tom
does
on
that
subject
said
maggie
rising
and
going
to
the
window
as
if
she
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
landscape
i
always
liked
philip
wakem
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
and
saw
him
at
lorton
he
was
so
good
when
tom
hurt
his
foot
oh
i
so
glad
said
lucy
then
you
wo
mind
his
coming
sometimes
and
we
can
have
much
more
music
than
we
could
without
him
i
very
fond
of
poor
philip
only
i
wish
he
were
not
so
morbid
about
his
deformity
i
suppose
it
his
deformity
that
makes
him
so
sad
and
sometimes
bitter
it
is
certainly
very
piteous
to
see
his
poor
little
crooked
body
and
pale
face
among
great
strong
people
but
lucy
said
maggie
trying
to
arrest
the
prattling
stream
ah
there
is
the
that
must
be
stephen
lucy
went
on
not
noticing
maggie
faint
effort
to
speak
one
of
the
things
i
most
admire
in
stephen
is
that
he
makes
a
greater
friend
of
philip
than
any
one
it
was
too
late
for
maggie
to
speak
now
the
drawingroom
door
was
opening
and
minny
was
already
growling
in
a
small
way
at
the
entrance
of
a
tall
gentleman
who
went
up
to
lucy
and
took
her
hand
with
a
glance
and
tone
of
inquiry
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
cousin
miss
tulliver
said
lucy
turning
with
wicked
enjoyment
toward
maggie
who
now
approached
from
the
farther
window
this
is
stephen
guest
for
one
instant
stephen
could
not
conceal
his
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
this
tall
nymph
with
her
coronet
of
hair
the
next
maggie
felt
herself
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
receiving
the
tribute
of
a
very
deep
blush
and
a
very
deep
bow
from
a
person
toward
whom
she
herself
was
conscious
of
timidity
this
new
experience
was
very
agreeable
to
her
so
agreeable
that
it
almost
effaced
her
previous
emotion
about
philip
there
was
a
new
brightness
in
her
eyes
and
a
very
becoming
flush
on
her
cheek
as
she
seated
herself
i
hope
you
perceive
what
a
striking
likeness
you
drew
the
day
before
yesterday
said
lucy
with
a
pretty
laugh
of
triumph
she
enjoyed
her
lover
confusion
the
advantage
was
usually
on
his
side
this
designing
cousin
of
yours
quite
deceived
me
miss
tulliver
said
stephen
seating
himself
by
lucy
and
stooping
to
play
with
minny
only
looking
at
maggie
furtively
she
said
you
had
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
nay
it
was
you
who
said
so
remonstrated
lucy
i
only
refrained
from
destroying
your
confidence
in
your
own
i
wish
i
could
always
err
in
the
same
way
said
stephen
and
find
reality
so
much
more
beautiful
than
my
preconceptions
now
you
have
proved
yourself
equal
to
the
occasion
said
maggie
and
said
what
it
was
incumbent
on
you
to
say
under
the
circumstances
she
flashed
a
slightly
defiant
look
at
him
it
was
clear
to
her
that
he
had
been
drawing
a
satirical
portrait
of
her
beforehand
lucy
had
said
he
was
inclined
to
be
satirical
and
maggie
had
mentally
supplied
the
addition
and
rather
conceited
an
alarming
amount
of
devil
there
was
stephen
first
thought
the
second
when
she
had
bent
over
her
work
was
i
wish
she
would
look
at
me
again
the
next
was
to
answer
i
suppose
all
phrases
of
mere
compliment
have
their
turn
to
be
true
a
man
is
occasionally
grateful
when
he
says
you
it
rather
hard
upon
him
that
he
must
use
the
same
words
with
which
all
the
world
declines
a
disagreeable
invitation
do
you
think
so
miss
tulliver
no
said
maggie
looking
at
him
with
her
direct
glance
if
we
use
common
words
on
a
great
occasion
they
are
the
more
striking
because
they
are
felt
at
once
to
have
a
particular
meaning
like
old
banners
or
clothes
hung
up
in
a
sacred
place
then
my
compliment
ought
to
be
eloquent
said
stephen
really
not
quite
knowing
what
he
said
while
maggie
looked
at
him
seeing
that
the
words
were
so
far
beneath
the
occasion
no
compliment
can
be
eloquent
except
as
an
expression
of
indifference
said
maggie
flushing
a
little
lucy
was
rather
alarmed
she
thought
stephen
and
maggie
were
not
going
to
like
each
other
she
had
always
feared
lest
maggie
should
appear
too
old
and
clever
to
please
that
critical
gentleman
why
dear
maggie
she
interposed
you
have
always
pretended
that
you
are
too
fond
of
being
admired
and
now
i
think
you
are
angry
because
some
one
ventures
to
admire
you
not
at
all
said
maggie
i
like
too
well
to
feel
that
i
am
admired
but
compliments
never
make
me
feel
that
i
will
never
pay
you
a
compliment
again
miss
tulliver
said
stephen
thank
you
that
will
be
a
proof
of
respect
poor
maggie
she
was
so
unused
to
society
that
she
could
take
nothing
as
a
matter
of
course
and
had
never
in
her
life
spoken
from
the
lips
merely
so
that
she
must
necessarily
appear
absurd
to
more
experienced
ladies
from
the
excessive
feeling
she
was
apt
to
throw
into
very
trivial
incidents
but
she
was
even
conscious
herself
of
a
little
absurdity
in
this
instance
it
was
true
she
had
a
theoretic
objection
to
compliments
and
had
once
said
impatiently
to
philip
that
she
did
see
why
women
were
to
be
told
with
a
simper
that
they
were
beautiful
any
more
than
old
men
were
to
be
told
that
they
were
venerable
still
to
be
so
irritated
by
a
common
practice
in
the
case
of
a
stranger
like
stephen
guest
and
to
care
about
his
having
spoken
slightingly
of
her
before
he
had
seen
her
was
certainly
unreasonable
and
as
soon
as
she
was
silent
she
began
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
her
irritation
was
due
to
the
pleasanter
emotion
which
preceded
it
just
as
when
we
are
satisfied
with
a
sense
of
glowing
warmth
an
innocent
drop
of
cold
water
may
fall
upon
us
as
a
sudden
smart
stephen
was
too
well
bred
not
to
seem
unaware
that
the
previous
conversation
could
have
been
felt
embarrassing
and
at
once
began
to
talk
of
impersonal
matters
asking
lucy
if
she
knew
when
the
bazaar
was
at
length
to
take
place
so
that
there
might
be
some
hope
of
seeing
her
rain
the
influence
of
her
eyes
on
objects
more
grateful
than
those
worsted
flowers
that
were
growing
under
her
fingers
some
day
next
month
i
believe
said
lucy
but
your
sisters
are
doing
more
for
it
than
i
am
they
are
to
have
the
largest
stall
ah
yes
but
they
carry
on
their
manufactures
in
their
own
where
i
do
intrude
on
them
i
see
you
are
not
addicted
to
the
fashionable
vice
of
miss
tulliver
said
stephen
looking
at
maggie
plain
hemming
no
said
maggie
i
can
do
nothing
more
difficult
or
more
elegant
than
and
your
plain
sewing
is
so
beautiful
maggie
said
lucy
that
i
think
i
shall
beg
a
few
specimens
of
you
to
show
as
your
exquisite
sewing
is
quite
a
mystery
to
me
you
used
to
dislike
that
sort
of
work
so
much
in
old
days
it
is
a
mystery
easily
explained
dear
said
maggie
looking
up
quietly
plain
sewing
was
the
only
thing
i
could
get
money
by
so
i
was
obliged
to
try
and
do
it
well
lucy
good
and
simple
as
she
was
could
not
help
blushing
a
little
she
did
not
quite
like
that
stephen
should
know
that
maggie
need
not
have
mentioned
it
perhaps
there
was
some
pride
in
the
confession
the
pride
of
poverty
that
will
not
be
ashamed
of
itself
but
if
maggie
had
been
the
queen
of
coquettes
she
could
hardly
have
invented
a
means
of
giving
greater
piquancy
to
her
beauty
in
stephen
eyes
i
am
not
sure
that
the
quiet
admission
of
plain
sewing
and
poverty
would
have
done
alone
but
assisted
by
the
beauty
they
made
maggie
more
unlike
other
women
even
than
she
had
seemed
at
first
but
i
can
knit
lucy
maggie
went
on
if
that
will
be
of
any
use
for
your
bazaar
oh
yes
of
infinite
use
i
shall
set
you
to
work
with
scarlet
wool
but
your
sister
is
the
most
enviable
person
continued
lucy
turning
to
stephen
to
have
the
talent
of
modelling
she
is
doing
a
wonderful
bust
of
kenn
entirely
from
memory
why
if
she
can
remember
to
put
the
eyes
very
near
together
and
the
corners
of
the
mouth
very
far
apart
the
likeness
can
hardly
fail
to
be
striking
in
st
ogg
now
that
is
very
wicked
of
you
said
lucy
looking
rather
hurt
i
did
think
you
would
speak
disrespectfully
of
dr
kenn
i
say
anything
disrespectful
of
kenn
heaven
forbid
but
i
am
not
bound
to
respect
a
libellous
bust
of
him
i
think
kenn
one
of
the
finest
fellows
in
the
world
i
do
care
much
about
the
tall
candlesticks
he
has
put
on
the
and
i
should
like
to
spoil
my
temper
by
getting
up
to
early
prayers
every
morning
but
he
the
only
man
i
ever
knew
personally
who
seems
to
me
to
have
anything
of
the
real
apostle
in
him
a
man
who
has
eight
hundred
and
is
contented
with
deal
furniture
and
boiled
beef
because
he
gives
away
of
his
income
that
was
a
very
fine
thing
of
him
taking
into
his
house
that
poor
lad
grattan
who
shot
his
mother
by
accident
he
sacrifices
more
time
than
a
less
busy
man
could
spare
to
save
the
poor
fellow
from
getting
into
a
morbid
state
of
mind
about
it
he
takes
the
lad
out
with
him
constantly
i
see
that
is
beautiful
said
maggie
who
had
let
her
work
fall
and
was
listening
with
keen
interest
i
never
knew
any
one
who
did
such
things
and
one
admires
that
sort
of
action
in
kenn
all
the
more
said
stephen
because
his
manners
in
general
are
rather
cold
and
severe
there
nothing
sugary
and
maudlin
about
him
oh
i
think
he
a
perfect
character
said
lucy
with
pretty
enthusiasm
no
there
i
ca
agree
with
you
said
stephen
shaking
his
head
with
sarcastic
gravity
now
what
fault
can
you
point
out
in
him
he
an
anglican
well
those
are
the
right
views
i
think
said
lucy
gravely
that
settles
the
question
in
the
abstract
said
stephen
but
not
from
a
parliamentary
point
of
view
he
has
set
the
dissenters
and
the
church
people
by
the
ears
and
a
rising
senator
like
myself
of
whose
services
the
country
is
very
much
in
need
will
find
it
inconvenient
when
he
puts
up
for
the
honor
of
representing
ogg
in
parliament
do
you
really
think
of
that
said
lucy
her
eyes
brightening
with
a
proud
pleasure
that
made
her
neglect
the
argumentative
interests
of
anglicanism
decidedly
whenever
old
leyburn
public
spirit
and
gout
induce
him
to
give
way
my
father
heart
is
set
on
it
and
gifts
like
mine
you
know
here
stephen
drew
himself
up
and
rubbed
his
large
white
hands
over
his
hair
with
playful
gifts
like
mine
involve
great
responsibilities
do
you
think
so
miss
tulliver
yes
said
maggie
smiling
but
not
looking
up
so
much
fluency
and
should
not
be
wasted
entirely
on
private
occasions
ah
i
see
how
much
penetration
you
have
said
stephen
you
have
discovered
already
that
i
am
talkative
and
impudent
now
superficial
people
never
discern
that
owing
to
my
manner
i
suppose
she
does
look
at
me
when
i
talk
of
myself
he
thought
while
his
listeners
were
laughing
i
must
try
other
subjects
did
lucy
intend
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
book
club
next
week
was
the
next
question
then
followed
the
recommendation
to
choose
southey
life
of
cowper
unless
she
were
inclined
to
be
philosophical
and
startle
the
ladies
of
ogg
by
voting
for
one
of
the
bridgewater
treatises
of
course
lucy
wished
to
know
what
these
alarmingly
learned
books
were
and
as
it
is
always
pleasant
to
improve
the
minds
of
ladies
by
talking
to
them
at
ease
on
subjects
of
which
they
know
nothing
stephen
became
quite
brilliant
in
an
account
of
buckland
treatise
which
he
had
just
been
reading
he
was
rewarded
by
seeing
maggie
let
her
work
fall
and
gradually
get
so
absorbed
in
his
wonderful
geological
story
that
she
sat
looking
at
him
leaning
forward
with
crossed
arms
and
with
an
entire
absence
of
as
if
he
had
been
the
snuffiest
of
old
professors
and
she
a
alumna
he
was
so
fascinated
by
the
clear
large
gaze
that
at
last
he
forgot
to
look
away
from
it
occasionally
toward
lucy
but
she
sweet
child
was
only
rejoicing
that
stephen
was
proving
to
maggie
how
clever
he
was
and
that
they
would
certainly
be
good
friends
after
all
i
will
bring
you
the
book
shall
i
miss
tulliver
said
stephen
when
he
found
the
stream
of
his
recollections
running
rather
shallow
there
are
many
illustrations
in
it
that
you
will
like
to
see
oh
thank
you
said
maggie
blushing
with
returning
at
this
direct
address
and
taking
up
her
work
again
no
no
lucy
interposed
i
must
forbid
your
plunging
maggie
in
books
i
shall
never
get
her
away
from
them
and
i
want
her
to
have
delicious
days
filled
with
boating
and
chatting
and
riding
and
driving
that
is
the
holiday
she
needs
apropos
said
stephen
looking
at
his
watch
shall
we
go
out
for
a
row
on
the
river
now
the
tide
will
suit
for
us
to
the
tofton
way
and
we
can
walk
back
that
was
a
delightful
proposition
to
maggie
for
it
was
years
since
she
had
been
on
the
river
when
she
was
gone
to
put
on
her
bonnet
lucy
lingered
to
give
an
order
to
the
servant
and
took
the
opportunity
of
telling
stephen
that
maggie
had
no
objection
to
seeing
philip
so
that
it
was
a
pity
she
had
sent
that
note
the
day
before
yesterday
but
she
would
write
another
and
invite
him
i
call
and
beat
him
up
said
stephen
and
bring
him
with
me
in
the
evening
shall
i
my
sisters
will
want
to
call
on
you
when
i
tell
them
your
cousin
is
with
you
i
must
leave
the
field
clear
for
them
in
the
morning
oh
yes
pray
bring
him
said
lucy
and
you
like
maggie
you
she
added
in
a
beseeching
tone
is
she
a
dear
creature
too
tall
said
stephen
smiling
down
upon
her
and
a
little
too
fiery
she
is
not
my
type
of
woman
you
know
gentlemen
you
are
aware
are
apt
to
impart
these
imprudent
confidences
to
ladies
concerning
their
unfavorable
opinion
of
sister
fair
ones
that
is
why
so
many
women
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
that
they
are
secretly
repulsive
to
men
who
have
made
ardent
love
to
them
and
hardly
anything
could
be
more
distinctively
characteristic
of
lucy
than
that
she
both
implicitly
believed
what
stephen
said
and
was
determined
that
maggie
should
not
know
it
but
you
who
have
a
higher
logic
than
the
verbal
to
guide
you
have
already
foreseen
as
the
direct
sequence
to
that
unfavorable
opinion
of
stephen
that
he
walked
down
to
the
boathouse
calculating
by
the
aid
of
a
vivid
imagination
that
maggie
must
give
him
her
hand
at
least
twice
in
consequence
of
this
pleasant
boating
plan
and
that
a
gentleman
who
wishes
ladies
to
look
at
him
is
advantageously
situated
when
he
is
rowing
them
in
a
boat
what
then
had
he
fallen
in
love
with
this
surprising
daughter
of
tulliver
at
first
sight
certainly
not
such
passions
are
never
heard
of
in
real
life
besides
he
was
in
love
already
and
to
the
dearest
little
creature
in
the
world
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
in
any
way
but
when
one
is
one
has
not
at
one
that
the
touch
of
a
handsome
girl
should
be
entirely
indifferent
it
was
perfectly
natural
and
safe
to
admire
beauty
and
enjoy
looking
at
it
at
least
under
such
circumstances
as
the
present
and
there
was
really
something
very
interesting
about
this
girl
with
her
poverty
and
troubles
it
was
gratifying
to
see
the
friendship
between
the
two
cousins
generally
stephen
admitted
he
was
not
fond
of
women
who
had
any
peculiarity
of
character
but
here
the
peculiarity
seemed
really
of
a
superior
kind
and
provided
one
is
not
obliged
to
marry
such
women
why
they
certainly
make
a
variety
in
social
intercourse
maggie
did
not
fulfil
stephen
hope
by
looking
at
him
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
her
eyes
were
too
full
of
the
old
banks
that
she
knew
so
well
she
felt
lonely
cut
off
from
philip
the
only
person
who
had
ever
seemed
to
love
her
devotedly
as
she
had
always
longed
to
be
loved
but
presently
the
rhythmic
movement
of
the
oars
attracted
her
and
she
thought
she
should
like
to
learn
how
to
row
this
roused
her
from
her
reverie
and
she
asked
if
she
might
take
an
oar
it
appeared
that
she
required
much
teaching
and
she
became
ambitious
the
exercise
brought
the
warm
blood
into
her
cheeks
and
made
her
inclined
to
take
her
lesson
merrily
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
until
i
can
manage
both
oars
and
row
you
and
lucy
she
said
looking
very
bright
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
boat
maggie
we
know
was
apt
to
forget
the
thing
she
was
doing
and
she
had
chosen
an
inopportune
moment
for
her
remark
her
foot
slipped
but
happily
stephen
guest
held
her
hand
and
kept
her
up
with
a
firm
grasp
you
have
not
hurt
yourself
at
all
i
hope
he
said
bending
to
look
in
her
face
with
anxiety
it
was
very
charming
to
be
taken
care
of
in
that
kind
graceful
manner
by
some
one
taller
and
stronger
than
self
maggie
had
never
felt
just
in
the
same
way
before
when
they
reached
home
again
they
found
uncle
and
aunt
pullet
seated
with
tulliver
in
the
and
stephen
hurried
away
asking
leave
to
come
again
in
the
evening
and
pray
bring
with
you
the
volume
of
purcell
that
you
took
away
said
lucy
i
want
maggie
to
hear
your
best
songs
aunt
pullet
under
the
certainty
that
maggie
would
be
invited
to
go
out
with
lucy
probably
to
park
house
was
much
shocked
at
the
shabbiness
of
her
clothes
which
when
witnessed
by
the
higher
society
of
ogg
would
be
a
discredit
to
the
family
that
demanded
a
strong
and
prompt
remedy
and
the
consultation
as
to
what
would
be
most
suitable
to
this
end
from
among
the
superfluities
of
pullet
wardrobe
was
one
that
lucy
as
well
as
tulliver
entered
into
with
some
zeal
maggie
must
really
have
an
evening
dress
as
soon
as
possible
and
she
was
about
the
same
height
as
aunt
pullet
but
she
so
much
broader
across
the
shoulders
than
i
am
it
very
said
pullet
else
she
might
wear
that
beautiful
black
brocade
o
mine
without
any
alteration
and
her
arms
are
beyond
everything
added
pullet
sorrowfully
as
she
lifted
large
round
arm
she
never
get
my
sleeves
on
oh
never
mind
that
aunt
send
us
the
dress
said
lucy
i
mean
maggie
to
have
long
sleeves
and
i
have
abundance
of
black
lace
for
trimming
her
arms
will
look
beautiful
maggie
arms
a
pretty
shape
said
tulliver
like
mine
used
to
be
only
mine
was
never
brown
i
wish
she
had
family
skin
nonsense
aunty
said
lucy
patting
her
aunt
tulliver
shoulder
you
do
understand
those
things
a
painter
would
think
complexion
beautiful
maybe
my
dear
said
tulliver
submissively
you
know
better
than
i
do
only
when
i
was
young
a
brown
skin
was
thought
well
on
among
respectable
folks
no
said
uncle
pullet
who
took
intense
interest
in
the
conversation
as
he
sucked
his
lozenges
though
there
was
a
song
about
the
maid
too
i
think
she
was
crazy
crazy
kate
but
i
ca
justly
remember
oh
dear
dear
said
maggie
laughing
but
impatient
i
think
that
will
be
the
end
of
brown
skin
if
it
is
always
to
be
talked
about
so
much
chapter
iii
confidential
moments
when
maggie
went
up
to
her
bedroom
that
night
it
appeared
that
she
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
undress
she
set
down
her
candle
on
the
first
table
that
presented
itself
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
her
room
which
was
a
large
one
with
a
firm
regular
and
rather
rapid
step
which
showed
that
the
exercise
was
the
instinctive
vent
of
strong
excitement
her
eyes
and
cheeks
had
an
almost
feverish
brilliancy
her
head
was
thrown
backward
and
her
hands
were
clasped
with
the
palms
outward
and
with
that
tension
of
the
arms
which
is
apt
to
accompany
mental
absorption
had
anything
remarkable
happened
nothing
that
you
are
not
likely
to
consider
in
the
highest
degree
unimportant
she
had
been
hearing
some
fine
music
sung
by
a
fine
bass
voice
but
then
it
was
sung
in
a
provincial
amateur
fashion
such
as
would
have
left
a
critical
ear
much
to
desire
and
she
was
conscious
of
having
been
looked
at
a
great
deal
in
rather
a
furtive
manner
from
beneath
a
pair
of
horizontal
eyebrows
with
a
glance
that
seemed
somehow
to
have
caught
the
vibratory
influence
of
the
voice
such
things
could
have
had
no
perceptible
effect
on
a
thoroughly
young
lady
with
a
perfectly
balanced
mind
who
had
had
all
the
advantages
of
fortune
training
and
refined
society
but
if
maggie
had
been
that
young
lady
you
would
probably
have
known
nothing
about
her
her
life
would
have
had
so
few
vicissitudes
that
it
could
hardly
have
been
written
for
the
happiest
women
like
the
happiest
nations
have
no
history
in
poor
maggie
hungry
nature
just
come
away
from
a
schoolroom
with
all
its
jarring
sounds
and
petty
round
of
tasks
these
apparently
trivial
causes
had
the
effect
of
rousing
and
exalting
her
imagination
in
a
way
that
was
mysterious
to
herself
it
was
not
that
she
thought
distinctly
of
stephen
guest
or
dwelt
on
the
indications
that
he
looked
at
her
with
admiration
it
was
rather
that
she
felt
the
presence
of
a
world
of
love
and
beauty
and
delight
made
up
of
vague
mingled
images
from
all
the
poetry
and
romance
she
had
ever
read
or
had
ever
woven
in
her
dreamy
reveries
her
mind
glanced
back
once
or
twice
to
the
time
when
she
had
courted
privation
when
she
had
thought
all
longing
all
impatience
was
subdued
but
that
condition
seemed
irrecoverably
gone
and
she
recoiled
from
the
remembrance
of
it
no
prayer
no
striving
now
would
bring
back
that
negative
peace
the
battle
of
her
life
it
seemed
was
not
to
be
decided
in
that
short
and
easy
way
by
perfect
renunciation
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
youth
the
music
was
vibrating
in
her
still
purcell
music
with
its
wild
passion
and
fancy
and
she
could
not
stay
in
the
recollection
of
that
bare
lonely
past
she
was
in
her
brighter
aerial
world
again
when
a
little
tap
came
at
the
door
of
course
it
was
her
cousin
who
entered
in
ample
white
why
maggie
you
naughty
child
have
you
begun
to
undress
said
lucy
in
astonishment
i
promised
not
to
come
and
talk
to
you
because
i
thought
you
must
be
tired
but
here
you
are
looking
as
if
you
were
ready
to
dress
for
a
ball
come
come
get
on
your
and
unplait
your
hair
well
are
not
very
forward
retorted
maggie
hastily
reaching
her
own
pink
cotton
gown
and
looking
at
lucy
hair
brushed
back
in
curly
disorder
oh
i
have
not
much
to
do
i
shall
sit
down
and
talk
to
you
till
i
see
you
are
really
on
the
way
to
bed
while
maggie
stood
and
unplaited
her
long
black
hair
over
her
pink
drapery
lucy
sat
down
near
the
watching
her
with
affectionate
eyes
and
head
a
little
aside
like
a
pretty
spaniel
if
it
appears
to
you
at
all
incredible
that
young
ladies
should
be
led
on
to
talk
confidentially
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
i
will
beg
you
to
remember
that
human
life
furnishes
many
exceptional
cases
you
really
enjoyed
the
music
have
you
maggie
oh
yes
that
is
what
prevented
me
from
feeling
sleepy
i
think
i
should
have
no
other
mortal
wants
if
i
could
always
have
plenty
of
music
it
seems
to
infuse
strength
into
my
limbs
and
ideas
into
my
brain
life
seems
to
go
on
without
effort
when
i
am
filled
with
music
at
other
times
one
is
conscious
of
carrying
a
weight
and
stephen
has
a
splendid
voice
has
he
well
perhaps
we
are
neither
of
us
judges
of
that
said
maggie
laughing
as
she
seated
herself
and
tossed
her
long
hair
back
you
are
not
impartial
and
think
any
splendid
but
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
now
tell
me
exactly
good
and
bad
too
oh
i
think
you
should
humiliate
him
a
little
a
lover
should
not
be
so
much
at
ease
and
so
he
ought
to
tremble
more
nonsense
maggie
as
if
any
one
could
tremble
at
me
you
think
he
is
conceited
i
see
that
but
you
do
dislike
him
do
you
dislike
him
no
am
i
in
the
habit
of
seeing
such
charming
people
that
i
should
be
very
difficult
to
please
besides
how
could
i
dislike
any
one
that
promised
to
make
you
happy
my
dear
thing
maggie
pinched
lucy
dimpled
chin
we
shall
have
more
music
evening
said
lucy
looking
happy
already
for
stephen
will
bring
philip
wakem
with
him
oh
lucy
i
ca
see
him
said
maggie
turning
pale
at
least
i
could
not
see
him
without
tom
leave
is
tom
such
a
tyrant
as
that
said
lucy
surprised
i
take
the
responsibility
then
tell
him
it
was
my
fault
but
dear
said
maggie
falteringly
i
promised
tom
very
solemnly
before
my
father
death
i
promised
him
i
would
not
speak
to
philip
without
his
knowledge
and
consent
and
i
have
a
great
dread
of
opening
the
subject
with
tom
of
getting
into
a
quarrel
with
him
again
but
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
strange
and
unreasonable
what
harm
can
poor
philip
have
done
may
i
speak
to
tom
about
it
oh
no
pray
do
dear
said
maggie
i
go
to
him
myself
and
tell
him
that
you
wish
philip
to
come
i
thought
before
of
asking
him
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
but
i
not
had
the
courage
to
determine
on
it
they
were
both
silent
for
some
moments
and
then
lucy
said
maggie
you
have
secrets
from
me
and
i
have
none
from
you
maggie
looked
meditatively
away
from
lucy
then
she
turned
to
her
and
said
i
like
to
tell
you
about
philip
but
lucy
you
must
not
betray
that
you
know
it
to
any
one
least
of
all
to
philip
himself
or
to
stephen
guest
the
narrative
lasted
long
for
maggie
had
never
before
known
the
relief
of
such
an
outpouring
she
had
never
before
told
lucy
anything
of
her
inmost
life
and
the
sweet
face
bent
toward
her
with
sympathetic
interest
and
the
little
hand
pressing
hers
encouraged
her
to
speak
on
on
two
points
only
she
was
not
expansive
she
did
not
betray
fully
what
still
rankled
in
her
mind
as
tom
great
offence
the
insults
he
had
heaped
on
philip
angry
as
the
remembrance
still
made
her
she
could
not
bear
that
any
one
else
should
know
it
at
all
both
for
tom
sake
and
philip
and
she
could
not
bear
to
tell
lucy
of
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
wakem
though
it
was
this
scene
which
she
had
ever
since
felt
to
be
a
new
barrier
between
herself
and
philip
she
merely
said
she
saw
now
that
tom
was
on
the
whole
right
in
regarding
any
prospect
of
love
and
marriage
between
her
and
philip
as
put
out
of
the
question
by
the
relation
of
the
two
families
of
course
philip
father
would
never
consent
there
lucy
you
have
had
my
story
said
maggie
smiling
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
you
see
i
am
like
sir
andrew
aguecheek
was
adored
once
ah
now
i
see
how
it
is
you
know
shakespeare
and
everything
and
have
learned
so
much
since
you
left
school
which
always
seemed
to
me
witchcraft
before
part
of
your
general
uncanniness
said
lucy
she
mused
a
little
with
her
eyes
downward
and
then
added
looking
at
maggie
it
is
very
beautiful
that
you
should
love
philip
i
never
thought
such
a
happiness
would
befall
him
and
in
my
opinion
you
ought
not
to
give
him
up
there
are
obstacles
now
but
they
may
be
done
away
with
in
time
maggie
shook
her
head
yes
yes
persisted
lucy
i
ca
help
being
hopeful
about
it
there
is
something
romantic
in
it
out
of
the
common
way
just
what
everything
that
happens
to
you
ought
to
be
and
philip
will
adore
you
like
a
husband
in
a
fairy
tale
oh
i
shall
puzzle
my
small
brain
to
contrive
some
plot
that
will
bring
everybody
into
the
right
mind
so
that
you
may
marry
philip
when
i
marry
somebody
else
would
that
be
a
pretty
ending
to
all
my
poor
poor
maggie
troubles
maggie
tried
to
smile
but
shivered
as
if
she
felt
a
sudden
chill
ah
dear
you
are
cold
said
lucy
you
must
go
to
bed
and
so
must
i
dare
not
think
what
time
it
is
they
kissed
each
other
and
lucy
went
away
possessed
of
a
confidence
which
had
a
strong
influence
over
her
subsequent
impressions
maggie
had
been
thoroughly
sincere
her
nature
had
never
found
it
easy
to
be
otherwise
but
confidences
are
sometimes
blinding
even
when
they
are
sincere
chapter
iv
brother
and
sister
maggie
was
obliged
to
go
to
tom
lodgings
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
he
would
be
coming
in
to
dinner
else
she
would
not
have
found
him
at
home
he
was
not
lodging
with
entire
strangers
our
friend
bob
jakin
had
with
mumps
tacit
consent
taken
not
only
a
wife
about
eight
months
ago
but
also
one
of
those
queer
old
houses
pierced
with
surprising
passages
by
the
where
as
he
observed
his
wife
and
mother
could
keep
themselves
out
of
mischief
by
letting
out
two
in
which
he
had
invested
some
of
his
savings
and
by
taking
in
a
lodger
for
the
parlor
and
spare
bedroom
under
these
circumstances
what
could
be
better
for
the
interests
of
all
parties
sanitary
considerations
apart
than
that
the
lodger
should
be
tom
it
was
bob
wife
who
opened
the
door
to
maggie
she
was
a
tiny
woman
with
the
general
physiognomy
of
a
dutch
doll
looking
in
comparison
with
bob
mother
who
filled
up
the
passage
in
the
rear
very
much
like
one
of
those
human
figures
which
the
artist
finds
conveniently
standing
near
a
colossal
statue
to
show
the
proportions
the
tiny
woman
curtsied
and
looked
up
at
maggie
with
some
awe
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
the
door
but
the
words
is
my
brother
at
home
which
maggie
uttered
smilingly
made
her
turn
round
with
sudden
excitement
and
say
eh
mother
mother
tell
bob
it
miss
maggie
come
in
miss
for
goodness
do
she
went
on
opening
a
side
door
and
endeavoring
to
flatten
her
person
against
the
wall
to
make
the
utmost
space
for
the
visitor
sad
recollections
crowded
on
maggie
as
she
entered
the
small
parlor
which
was
now
all
that
poor
tom
had
to
call
by
the
name
of
home
that
name
which
had
once
so
many
years
ago
meant
for
both
of
them
the
same
sum
of
dear
familiar
objects
but
everything
was
not
strange
to
her
in
this
new
room
the
first
thing
her
eyes
dwelt
on
was
the
large
old
bible
and
the
sight
was
not
likely
to
disperse
the
old
memories
she
stood
without
speaking
if
you
please
to
take
the
privilege
o
sitting
down
miss
said
jakin
rubbing
her
apron
over
a
perfectly
clean
chair
and
then
lifting
up
the
corner
of
that
garment
and
holding
it
to
her
face
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
as
she
looked
wonderingly
at
maggie
bob
is
at
home
then
said
maggie
recovering
herself
and
smiling
at
the
bashful
dutch
doll
yes
miss
but
i
think
he
must
be
washing
and
dressing
himself
go
and
see
said
jakin
disappearing
but
she
presently
came
back
walking
with
new
courage
a
little
way
behind
her
husband
who
showed
the
brilliancy
of
his
blue
eyes
and
regular
white
teeth
in
the
doorway
bowing
respectfully
how
do
you
do
bob
said
maggie
coming
forward
and
putting
out
her
hand
to
him
i
always
meant
to
pay
your
wife
a
visit
and
i
shall
come
another
day
on
purpose
for
that
if
she
will
let
me
but
i
was
obliged
to
come
to
speak
to
my
brother
he
be
in
before
long
miss
he
doin
finely
tom
is
be
one
o
the
first
men
hereabouts
you
see
that
well
bob
i
sure
he
be
indebted
to
you
whatever
he
becomes
he
said
so
himself
only
the
other
night
when
he
was
talking
of
you
eh
miss
that
his
way
o
takin
it
but
i
think
the
more
o
when
he
says
a
thing
because
his
tongue
does
overshoot
him
as
mine
does
lors
i
no
better
nor
a
tilted
bottle
i
i
ca
stop
mysen
when
once
i
begin
but
you
look
rarely
miss
it
does
me
good
to
see
you
what
do
you
say
now
prissy
here
bob
turned
to
his
wife
is
it
all
come
true
as
i
said
though
there
is
many
sorts
o
goods
as
i
ca
when
i
set
my
tongue
bob
small
nose
seemed
to
be
following
the
example
of
her
eyes
in
turning
up
reverentially
toward
maggie
but
she
was
able
now
to
smile
and
curtsey
and
say
i
looked
forrard
like
aenything
to
seein
you
miss
for
my
husband
tongue
been
runnin
on
you
like
as
if
he
was
iver
since
first
he

on
me
well
well
said
bob
looking
rather
silly
go
an
see
after
the
taters
else
tom
have
to
wait
for
i
hope
mumps
is
friendly
with
jakin
bob
said
maggie
smiling
i
remember
you
used
to
say
he
would
like
your
marrying
eh
miss
said
bob
he
made
up
his
mind
when
he
see
what
a
little
un
she
was
he
pretends
not
to
see
her
mostly
or
else
to
think
as
she
is
but
about
tom
miss
said
bob
speaking
lower
and
looking
serious
he
as
close
as
a
iron
biler
he
is
but
i
a
chap
an
when
i
left
off
carrying
my
pack
an
am
at
a
loose
end
i
got
more
brains
nor
i
know
what
to
do
wi
an
forced
to
busy
myself
wi
other
folks
insides
an
it
worrets
me
as
tom
sit
by
himself
so
glumpish
his
brow
at
the
fire
of
a
night
he
should
be
a
bit
livelier
now
a
fine
young
fellow
like
him
my
wife
says
when
she
goes
in
sometimes
an
he
takes
no
notice
of
her
he
sits
lookin
into
the
fire
and
frownin
as
if
he
was
watchin
folks
at
work
in
it
he
thinks
so
much
about
business
said
maggie
ay
said
bob
speaking
lower
but
do
you
think
it
nothin
else
miss
he
close
tom
is
but
i
a
chap
i
am
an
i
thought
last
christmas
as
i
found
out
a
soft
place
in
him
it
was
about
a
little
black
spaniel
a
rare
bit
o
breed
as
he
made
a
fuss
to
get
but
since
then
summat
come
over
him
as
he
set
his
teeth
again
things
more
nor
iver
for
all
he
had
such
good
luck
an
i
wanted
to
tell
miss
i
thought
you
might
work
it
out
of
him
a
bit
now
you
come
he
a
deal
too
lonely
and
go
into
company
enough
i
afraid
i
have
very
little
power
over
him
bob
said
maggie
a
good
deal
moved
by
bob
suggestion
it
was
a
totally
new
idea
to
her
mind
that
tom
could
have
his
love
troubles
poor
fellow
and
in
love
with
lucy
too
but
it
was
perhaps
a
mere
fancy
of
bob
too
officious
brain
the
present
of
the
dog
meant
nothing
more
than
cousinship
and
gratitude
but
bob
had
already
said
here
tom
and
the
outer
door
was
opening
there
is
no
time
to
spare
tom
said
maggie
as
soon
as
bob
left
the
room
i
must
tell
you
at
once
what
i
came
about
else
i
shall
be
hindering
you
from
taking
your
dinner
tom
stood
with
his
back
against
the
and
maggie
was
seated
opposite
the
light
he
noticed
that
she
was
tremulous
and
he
had
a
presentiment
of
the
subject
she
was
going
to
speak
about
the
presentiment
made
his
voice
colder
and
harder
as
he
said
what
is
it
this
tone
roused
a
spirit
of
resistance
in
maggie
and
she
put
her
request
in
quite
a
different
form
from
the
one
she
had
predetermined
on
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
looking
straight
at
tom
said
i
want
you
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
about
philip
wakem
or
rather
i
promised
you
not
to
see
him
without
telling
you
i
am
come
to
tell
you
that
i
wish
to
see
him
very
well
said
tom
still
more
coldly
but
maggie
had
hardly
finished
speaking
in
that
chill
defiant
manner
before
she
repented
and
felt
the
dread
of
alienation
from
her
brother
not
for
myself
dear
tom
do
be
angry
i
should
have
asked
it
only
that
philip
you
know
is
a
friend
of
lucy
and
she
wishes
him
to
come
has
invited
him
to
come
this
evening
and
i
told
her
i
could
see
him
without
telling
you
i
shall
only
see
him
in
the
presence
of
other
people
there
will
never
be
anything
secret
between
us
again
tom
looked
away
from
maggie
knitting
his
brow
more
strongly
for
a
little
while
then
he
turned
to
her
and
said
slowly
and
emphatically
you
know
what
is
my
feeling
on
that
subject
maggie
there
is
no
need
for
my
repeating
anything
i
said
a
year
ago
while
my
father
was
living
i
felt
bound
to
use
the
utmost
power
over
you
to
prevent
you
from
disgracing
him
as
well
as
yourself
and
all
of
us
but
now
i
must
leave
you
to
your
own
choice
you
wish
to
be
independent
you
told
me
so
after
my
father
death
my
opinion
is
not
changed
if
you
think
of
philip
wakem
as
a
lover
again
you
must
give
up
me
i
do
wish
it
dear
tom
at
least
as
things
are
i
see
that
it
would
lead
to
misery
but
i
shall
soon
go
away
to
another
situation
and
i
should
like
to
be
friends
with
him
again
while
i
am
here
lucy
wishes
it
the
severity
of
tom
face
relaxed
a
little
i
should
mind
your
seeing
him
occasionally
at
my
uncle
i
want
you
to
make
a
fuss
on
the
subject
but
i
have
no
confidence
in
you
maggie
you
would
be
led
away
to
do
anything
that
was
a
cruel
word
maggie
lip
began
to
tremble
why
will
you
say
that
tom
it
is
very
hard
of
you
have
i
not
done
and
borne
everything
as
well
as
i
could
and
i
kept
my
word
to
you
when
when
my
life
has
not
been
a
happy
one
any
more
than
yours
she
was
obliged
to
be
childish
the
tears
would
come
when
maggie
was
not
angry
she
was
as
dependent
on
kind
or
cold
words
as
a
daisy
on
the
sunshine
or
the
cloud
the
need
of
being
loved
would
always
subdue
her
as
in
old
days
it
subdued
her
in
the
attic
the
brother
goodness
came
uppermost
at
this
appeal
but
it
could
only
show
itself
in
tom
fashion
he
put
his
hand
gently
on
her
arm
and
said
in
the
tone
of
a
kind
pedagogue
now
listen
to
me
maggie
i
tell
you
what
i
mean
you
always
in
extremes
you
have
no
judgment
and
and
yet
you
think
you
know
best
and
will
not
submit
to
be
guided
you
know
i
did
wish
you
to
take
a
situation
my
aunt
pullet
was
willing
to
give
you
a
good
home
and
you
might
have
lived
respectably
amongst
your
relations
until
i
could
have
provided
a
home
for
you
with
my
mother
and
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
do
i
wished
my
sister
to
be
a
lady
and
i
always
have
taken
care
of
you
as
my
father
desired
until
you
were
well
married
but
your
ideas
and
mine
never
accord
and
you
will
not
give
way
yet
you
might
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
a
brother
who
goes
out
into
the
world
and
mixes
with
men
necessarily
knows
better
what
is
right
and
respectable
for
his
sister
than
she
can
know
herself
you
think
i
am
not
kind
but
my
kindness
can
only
be
directed
by
what
i
believe
to
be
good
for
you
yes
i
know
dear
tom
said
maggie
still
but
trying
to
control
her
tears
i
know
you
would
do
a
great
deal
for
me
i
know
how
you
work
and
do
spare
yourself
i
am
grateful
to
you
but
indeed
you
ca
quite
judge
for
me
our
natures
are
very
different
you
do
know
how
differently
things
affect
me
from
what
they
do
you
yes
i
know
i
know
it
too
well
i
know
how
differently
you
must
feel
about
all
that
affects
our
family
and
your
own
dignity
as
a
young
woman
before
you
could
think
of
receiving
secret
addresses
from
philip
wakem
if
it
was
not
disgusting
to
me
in
every
other
way
i
should
object
to
my
sister
name
being
associated
for
a
moment
with
that
of
a
young
man
whose
father
must
hate
the
very
thought
of
us
all
and
would
spurn
you
with
any
one
but
you
i
should
think
it
quite
certain
that
what
you
witnessed
just
before
my
father
death
would
secure
you
from
ever
thinking
again
of
philip
wakem
as
a
lover
but
i
do
feel
certain
of
it
with
you
i
never
feel
certain
about
anything
with
at
one
time
you
take
pleasure
in
a
sort
of
perverse
and
at
another
you
have
not
resolution
to
resist
a
thing
that
you
know
to
be
wrong
there
was
a
terrible
cutting
truth
in
tom
words
that
hard
rind
of
truth
which
is
discerned
by
unimaginative
unsympathetic
minds
maggie
always
writhed
under
this
judgment
of
tom
she
rebelled
and
was
humiliated
in
the
same
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
held
a
glass
before
her
to
show
her
her
own
folly
and
weakness
as
if
he
were
a
prophetic
voice
predicting
her
future
fallings
and
yet
all
the
while
she
judged
him
in
return
she
said
inwardly
that
he
was
narrow
and
unjust
that
he
was
below
feeling
those
mental
needs
which
were
often
the
source
of
the
or
absurdity
that
made
her
life
a
planless
riddle
to
him
she
did
not
answer
directly
her
heart
was
too
full
and
she
sat
down
leaning
her
arm
on
the
table
it
was
no
use
trying
to
make
tom
feel
that
she
was
near
to
him
he
always
repelled
her
her
feeling
under
his
words
was
complicated
by
the
allusion
to
the
last
scene
between
her
father
and
wakem
and
at
length
that
painful
solemn
memory
surmounted
the
immediate
grievance
no
she
did
not
think
of
such
things
with
frivolous
indifference
and
tom
must
not
accuse
her
of
that
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
grave
earnest
gaze
and
said
i
ca
make
you
think
better
of
me
tom
by
anything
i
can
say
but
i
am
not
so
shut
out
from
all
your
feelings
as
you
believe
me
to
be
i
see
as
well
as
you
do
that
from
our
position
with
regard
to
father
not
on
other
grounds
it
would
be
unreasonable
it
would
be
wrong
for
us
to
entertain
the
idea
of
marriage
and
i
have
given
up
thinking
of
him
as
a
lover
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
and
you
have
no
right
to
disbelieve
me
i
have
kept
my
word
to
you
and
you
have
never
detected
me
in
a
falsehood
i
should
not
only
not
encourage
i
should
carefully
avoid
any
intercourse
with
philip
on
any
other
footing
than
of
quiet
friendship
you
may
think
that
i
am
unable
to
keep
my
resolutions
but
at
least
you
ought
not
to
treat
me
with
hard
contempt
on
the
ground
of
faults
that
i
have
not
committed
yet
well
maggie
said
tom
softening
under
this
appeal
i
do
want
to
overstrain
matters
i
think
all
things
considered
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
see
philip
wakem
if
lucy
wishes
him
to
come
to
the
house
i
believe
what
you
say
at
least
you
believe
it
yourself
i
know
i
can
only
warn
you
i
wish
to
be
as
good
a
brother
to
you
as
you
will
let
me
there
was
a
little
tremor
in
tom
voice
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
and
maggie
ready
affection
came
back
with
as
sudden
a
glow
as
when
they
were
children
and
bit
their
cake
together
as
a
sacrament
of
conciliation
she
rose
and
laid
her
hand
on
tom
shoulder
dear
tom
i
know
you
mean
to
be
good
i
know
you
have
had
a
great
deal
to
bear
and
have
done
a
great
deal
i
should
like
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
not
to
vex
you
you
do
think
i
altogether
naughty
now
do
you
tom
smiled
at
the
eager
face
his
smiles
were
very
pleasant
to
see
when
they
did
come
for
the
gray
eyes
could
be
tender
underneath
the
frown
no
maggie
i
may
turn
out
better
than
you
expect
i
hope
you
will
and
may
i
come
some
day
and
make
tea
for
you
and
see
this
extremely
small
wife
of
bob
again
yes
but
trot
away
now
for
i
no
more
time
to
spare
said
tom
looking
at
his
watch
not
to
give
me
a
kiss
tom
bent
to
kiss
her
cheek
and
then
said
there
be
a
good
girl
i
got
a
great
deal
to
think
of
going
to
have
a
long
consultation
with
my
uncle
deane
this
afternoon
you
come
to
aunt
glegg
we
going
all
to
dine
early
that
we
may
go
there
to
tea
you
come
lucy
told
me
to
say
so
oh
pooh
i
plenty
else
to
do
said
tom
pulling
his
bell
violently
and
bringing
down
the
small
i
frightened
i
shall
run
away
said
maggie
making
a
laughing
retreat
while
tom
with
masculine
philosophy
flung
the
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
not
very
far
either
a
touch
of
human
experience
which
i
flatter
myself
will
come
home
to
the
bosoms
of
not
a
few
substantial
or
distinguished
men
who
were
once
at
an
early
stage
of
their
rise
in
the
world
and
were
cherishing
very
large
hopes
in
very
small
lodgings
chapter
v
showing
that
tom
had
opened
the
oyster
and
now
we
settled
this
newcastle
business
tom
said
deane
that
same
afternoon
as
they
were
seated
in
the
private
room
at
the
bank
together
there
another
matter
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
since
you
likely
to
have
rather
a
smoky
unpleasant
time
of
it
at
newcastle
for
the
next
few
weeks
you
want
a
good
prospect
of
some
sort
to
keep
up
your
spirits
tom
waited
less
nervously
than
he
had
done
on
a
former
occasion
in
this
apartment
while
his
uncle
took
out
his
and
gratified
each
nostril
with
deliberate
impartiality
you
see
tom
said
deane
at
last
throwing
himself
backward
the
world
goes
on
at
a
smarter
pace
now
than
it
did
when
i
was
a
young
fellow
why
sir
forty
years
ago
when
i
was
much
such
a
strapping
youngster
as
you
a
man
expected
to
pull
between
the
shafts
the
best
part
of
his
life
before
he
got
the
whip
in
his
hand
the
looms
went
slowish
and
fashions
did
alter
quite
so
fast
i
a
best
suit
that
lasted
me
six
years
everything
was
on
a
lower
scale
sir
in
point
of
expenditure
i
mean
it
this
steam
you
see
that
has
made
the
difference
it
drives
on
every
wheel
double
pace
and
the
wheel
of
fortune
along
with
as
our
stephen
guest
said
at
the
anniversary
dinner
he
hits
these
things
off
wonderfully
considering
he
seen
nothing
of
business
i
do
find
fault
with
the
change
as
some
people
do
trade
sir
opens
a
man
eyes
and
if
the
population
is
to
get
thicker
upon
the
ground
as
it
doing
the
world
must
use
its
wits
at
inventions
of
one
sort
or
other
i
know
i
done
my
share
as
an
ordinary
man
of
business
somebody
has
said
it
a
fine
thing
to
make
two
ears
of
corn
grow
where
only
one
grew
before
but
sir
a
fine
thing
too
to
further
the
exchange
of
commodities
and
bring
the
grains
of
corn
to
the
mouths
that
are
hungry
and
that
our
line
of
business
and
i
consider
it
as
honorable
a
position
as
a
man
can
hold
to
be
connected
with
it
tom
knew
that
the
affair
his
uncle
had
to
speak
of
was
not
urgent
deane
was
too
shrewd
and
practical
a
man
to
allow
either
his
reminiscences
or
his
snuff
to
impede
the
progress
of
trade
indeed
for
the
last
month
or
two
there
had
been
hints
thrown
out
to
tom
which
enabled
him
to
guess
that
he
was
going
to
hear
some
proposition
for
his
own
benefit
with
the
beginning
of
the
last
speech
he
had
stretched
out
his
legs
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
prepared
himself
for
some
introductory
diffuseness
tending
to
show
that
deane
had
succeeded
by
his
own
merit
and
that
what
he
had
to
say
to
young
men
in
general
was
that
if
they
did
succeed
too
it
was
because
of
their
own
demerit
he
was
rather
surprised
then
when
his
uncle
put
a
direct
question
to
him
let
me
see
it
going
on
for
seven
years
now
since
you
applied
to
me
for
a
situation
eh
tom
yes
sir
i
now
said
tom
ah
it
as
well
not
to
say
that
though
for
you
pass
for
a
good
deal
older
and
age
tells
well
in
business
i
remember
your
coming
very
well
i
remember
i
saw
there
was
some
pluck
in
you
and
that
was
what
made
me
give
you
encouragement
and
i
happy
to
say
i
was
right
i
not
often
deceived
i
was
naturally
a
little
shy
at
pushing
my
nephew
but
i
happy
to
say
you
done
me
credit
sir
and
if
had
a
son
o
my
own
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
like
you
deane
tapped
his
box
and
opened
it
again
repeating
in
a
tone
of
some
feeling
no
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
like
you
i
very
glad
i
given
you
satisfaction
sir
i
done
my
best
said
tom
in
his
proud
independent
way
yes
tom
you
given
me
satisfaction
i
do
speak
of
your
conduct
as
a
son
though
that
weighs
with
me
in
my
opinion
of
you
but
what
i
have
to
do
with
as
a
partner
in
our
firm
is
the
qualities
shown
as
a
man
o
business
ours
is
a
fine
business
a
splendid
concern
sir
and
there
no
reason
why
it
should
go
on
growing
there
a
growing
capital
and
growing
outlets
for
it
but
another
thing
that
wanted
for
the
prosperity
of
every
concern
large
or
small
and
that
men
to
conduct
it
men
of
the
right
habits
none
o
your
flashy
fellows
but
such
as
are
to
be
depended
on
now
this
is
what
mr
guest
and
i
see
clear
enough
three
years
ago
we
took
gell
into
the
concern
we
gave
him
a
share
in
the
and
why
why
because
gell
was
a
fellow
whose
services
were
worth
a
premium
so
it
will
always
be
sir
so
it
was
with
me
and
though
gell
is
pretty
near
ten
years
older
than
you
there
are
other
points
in
your
favor
tom
was
getting
a
little
nervous
as
deane
went
on
speaking
he
was
conscious
of
something
he
had
in
his
mind
to
say
which
might
not
be
agreeable
to
his
uncle
simply
because
it
was
a
new
suggestion
rather
than
an
acceptance
of
the
proposition
he
foresaw
it
stands
to
reason
deane
went
on
when
he
had
finished
his
new
pinch
that
your
being
my
nephew
weighs
in
your
favor
but
i
deny
that
if
you
been
no
relation
of
mine
at
all
your
conduct
in
that
affair
of
pelley
bank
would
have
led
mr
guest
and
myself
to
make
some
acknowledgment
of
the
service
you
been
to
us
and
backed
by
your
general
conduct
and
business
ability
it
has
made
us
determine
on
giving
you
a
share
in
the
business
a
share
which
we
shall
be
glad
to
increase
as
the
years
go
on
we
think
that
be
better
on
all
grounds
than
raising
your
salary
it
give
you
more
importance
and
prepare
you
better
for
taking
some
of
the
anxiety
off
my
shoulders
by
and
by
i
equal
to
a
good
deal
o
work
at
present
thank
god
but
i
getting
older
there
no
denying
that
i
told
mr
guest
i
would
open
the
subject
to
you
and
when
you
come
back
from
this
northern
business
we
can
go
into
particulars
this
is
a
great
stride
for
a
young
fellow
of
but
i
bound
to
say
you
deserved
it
i
very
grateful
to
mr
guest
and
you
sir
of
course
i
feel
the
most
indebted
to
who
first
took
me
into
the
business
and
have
taken
a
good
deal
of
pains
with
me
since
tom
spoke
with
a
slight
tremor
and
paused
after
he
had
said
this
yes
yes
said
deane
i
do
spare
pains
when
i
see
they
be
of
any
use
i
gave
myself
some
trouble
with
gell
else
he
have
been
what
he
is
but
there
one
thing
i
should
like
to
mention
to
you
uncle
never
spoken
to
you
of
it
before
if
you
remember
at
the
time
my
father
property
was
sold
there
was
some
thought
of
your
firm
buying
the
mill
i
know
you
thought
it
would
be
a
very
good
investment
especially
if
steam
were
applied
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
but
wakem
outbid
us
he
made
up
his
mind
to
that
he
rather
fond
of
carrying
everything
over
other
heads
perhaps
it
of
no
use
my
mentioning
it
at
present
tom
went
on
but
i
wish
you
to
know
what
i
have
in
my
mind
about
the
mill
i
a
strong
feeling
about
it
it
was
my
father
dying
wish
that
i
should
try
and
get
it
back
again
whenever
i
could
it
was
in
his
family
for
five
generations
i
promised
my
father
and
besides
that
i
attached
to
the
place
i
shall
never
like
any
other
so
well
and
if
it
should
ever
suit
your
views
to
buy
it
for
the
firm
i
should
have
a
better
chance
of
fulfilling
my
father
wish
i
should
have
liked
to
mention
the
thing
to
you
only
you
been
kind
enough
to
say
my
services
have
been
of
some
value
and
i
give
up
a
much
greater
chance
in
life
for
the
sake
of
having
the
mill
again
i
mean
having
it
in
my
own
hands
and
gradually
working
off
the
price
deane
had
listened
attentively
and
now
looked
thoughtful
i
see
i
see
he
said
after
a
while
the
thing
would
be
possible
if
there
were
any
chance
of
wakem
parting
with
the
property
but
that
i
see
he
put
that
young
jetsome
in
the
place
and
he
had
his
reasons
when
he
bought
it
i
be
bound
he
a
loose
fish
that
young
jetsome
said
tom
he
taking
to
drinking
and
they
say
he
letting
the
business
go
down
luke
told
me
about
it
our
old
miller
he
says
he
stay
unless
there
an
alteration
i
was
thinking
if
things
went
on
that
way
wakem
might
be
more
willing
to
part
with
the
mill
luke
says
he
getting
very
sour
about
the
way
things
are
going
on
well
i
turn
it
over
tom
i
must
inquire
into
the
matter
and
go
into
it
with
mr
guest
but
you
see
it
rather
striking
out
a
new
branch
and
putting
you
to
that
instead
of
keeping
you
where
you
are
which
was
what
we
wanted
i
should
be
able
to
manage
more
than
the
mill
when
things
were
once
set
properly
going
sir
i
want
to
have
plenty
of
work
nothing
else
i
care
about
much
there
was
something
rather
sad
in
that
speech
from
a
young
man
of
even
in
uncle
deane
ears
pooh
pooh
you
be
having
a
wife
to
care
about
one
of
these
days
if
you
get
on
at
this
pace
in
the
world
but
as
to
this
mill
we
must
reckon
on
our
chickens
too
early
however
i
promise
you
to
bear
it
in
mind
and
when
you
come
back
we
talk
of
it
again
i
am
going
to
dinner
now
come
and
breakfast
with
us
morning
and
say
to
your
mother
and
sister
before
you
start
chapter
vi
illustrating
the
laws
of
attraction
it
is
evident
to
you
now
that
maggie
had
arrived
at
a
moment
in
her
life
which
must
be
considered
by
all
prudent
persons
as
a
great
opportunity
for
a
young
woman
launched
into
the
higher
society
of
ogg
with
a
striking
person
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
quite
unfamiliar
to
the
majority
of
beholders
and
with
such
moderate
assistance
of
costume
as
you
have
seen
foreshadowed
in
lucy
anxious
colloquy
with
aunt
pullet
maggie
was
certainly
at
a
new
in
life
at
lucy
first
evening
party
young
torry
fatigued
his
facial
muscles
more
than
usual
in
order
that
the
girl
there
in
the
corner
might
see
him
in
all
the
additional
style
conferred
by
his
eyeglass
and
several
young
ladies
went
home
intending
to
have
short
sleeves
with
black
lace
and
to
plait
their
hair
in
a
broad
coronet
at
the
back
of
their
head
that
cousin
of
miss
deane
looked
so
very
well
in
fact
poor
maggie
with
all
her
inward
consciousness
of
a
painful
past
and
her
presentiment
of
a
troublous
future
was
on
the
way
to
become
an
object
of
some
envy
a
topic
of
discussion
in
the
newly
established
and
between
fair
friends
who
had
no
secrets
from
each
other
on
the
subject
of
trimmings
the
miss
guests
who
associated
chiefly
on
terms
of
condescension
with
the
families
of
ogg
and
were
the
glass
of
fashion
there
took
some
exception
to
manners
she
had
a
way
of
not
assenting
at
once
to
the
observations
current
in
good
society
and
of
saying
that
she
did
know
whether
those
observations
were
true
or
not
which
gave
her
an
air
of
and
impeded
the
even
flow
of
conversation
but
it
is
a
fact
capable
of
an
amiable
interpretation
that
ladies
are
not
the
worst
disposed
toward
a
new
acquaintance
of
their
own
sex
because
she
has
points
of
inferiority
and
maggie
was
so
entirely
without
those
pretty
airs
of
coquetry
which
have
the
traditional
reputation
of
driving
gentlemen
to
despair
that
she
won
some
feminine
pity
for
being
so
ineffective
in
spite
of
her
beauty
she
had
not
had
many
advantages
poor
thing
and
it
must
be
admitted
there
was
no
pretension
about
her
her
abruptness
and
unevenness
of
manner
were
plainly
the
result
of
her
secluded
and
lowly
circumstances
it
was
only
a
wonder
that
there
was
no
tinge
of
vulgarity
about
her
considering
what
the
rest
of
poor
lucy
relations
were
an
allusion
which
always
made
the
miss
guests
shudder
a
little
it
was
not
agreeable
to
think
of
any
connection
by
marriage
with
such
people
as
the
gleggs
and
the
pullets
but
it
was
of
no
use
to
contradict
stephen
when
once
he
had
set
his
mind
on
anything
and
certainly
there
was
no
possible
objection
to
lucy
in
herself
no
one
could
help
liking
her
she
would
naturally
desire
that
the
miss
guests
should
behave
kindly
to
this
cousin
of
whom
she
was
so
fond
and
stephen
would
make
a
great
fuss
if
they
were
deficient
in
civility
under
these
circumstances
the
invitations
to
park
house
were
not
wanting
and
elsewhere
also
miss
deane
was
too
popular
and
too
distinguished
a
member
of
society
in
ogg
for
any
attention
toward
her
to
be
neglected
thus
maggie
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
to
the
young
life
and
knew
what
it
was
to
get
up
in
the
morning
without
any
imperative
reason
for
doing
one
thing
more
than
another
this
new
sense
of
leisure
and
unchecked
enjoyment
amidst
the
airs
and
of
advancing
spring
amidst
the
new
abundance
of
music
and
lingering
strolls
in
the
sunshine
and
the
delicious
dreaminess
of
gliding
on
the
river
could
hardly
be
without
some
intoxicating
effect
on
her
after
her
years
of
privation
and
even
in
the
first
week
maggie
began
to
be
less
haunted
by
her
sad
memories
and
anticipations
life
was
certainly
very
pleasant
just
now
it
was
becoming
very
pleasant
to
dress
in
the
evening
and
to
feel
that
she
was
one
of
the
beautiful
things
of
this
and
there
were
admiring
eyes
always
awaiting
her
now
she
was
no
longer
an
unheeded
person
liable
to
be
chid
from
whom
attention
was
continually
claimed
and
on
whom
no
one
felt
bound
to
confer
any
it
was
pleasant
too
when
stephen
and
lucy
were
gone
out
riding
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
alone
and
find
that
the
old
fitness
between
her
fingers
and
the
keys
remained
and
revived
like
a
sympathetic
kinship
not
to
be
worn
out
by
separation
to
get
the
tunes
she
had
heard
the
evening
before
and
repeat
them
again
and
again
until
she
had
found
out
a
way
of
producing
them
so
as
to
make
them
a
more
pregnant
passionate
language
to
her
the
mere
concord
of
octaves
was
a
delight
to
maggie
and
she
would
often
take
up
a
book
of
studies
rather
than
any
melody
that
she
might
taste
more
keenly
by
abstraction
the
more
primitive
sensation
of
intervals
not
that
her
enjoyment
of
music
was
of
the
kind
that
indicates
a
great
specific
talent
it
was
rather
that
her
sensibility
to
the
supreme
excitement
of
music
was
only
one
form
of
that
passionate
sensibility
which
belonged
to
her
whole
nature
and
made
her
faults
and
virtues
all
merge
in
each
other
made
her
affections
sometimes
an
impatient
demand
but
also
prevented
her
vanity
from
taking
the
form
of
mere
feminine
coquetry
and
device
and
gave
it
the
poetry
of
ambition
but
you
have
known
maggie
a
long
while
and
need
to
be
told
not
her
characteristics
but
her
history
which
is
a
thing
hardly
to
be
predicted
even
from
the
completest
knowledge
of
characteristics
for
the
tragedy
of
our
lives
is
not
created
entirely
from
within
character
says
novalis
in
one
of
his
questionable
aphorisms
character
is
destiny
but
not
the
whole
of
our
destiny
hamlet
prince
of
denmark
was
speculative
and
irresolute
and
we
have
a
great
tragedy
in
consequence
but
if
his
father
had
lived
to
a
good
old
age
and
his
uncle
had
died
an
early
death
we
can
conceive
hamlet
having
married
ophelia
and
got
through
life
with
a
reputation
of
sanity
notwithstanding
many
soliloquies
and
some
moody
sarcasms
toward
the
fair
daughter
of
polonius
to
say
nothing
of
the
frankest
incivility
to
his
maggie
destiny
then
is
at
present
hidden
and
we
must
wait
for
it
to
reveal
itself
like
the
course
of
an
unmapped
river
we
only
know
that
the
river
is
full
and
rapid
and
that
for
all
rivers
there
is
the
same
final
home
under
the
charm
of
her
new
pleasures
maggie
herself
was
ceasing
to
think
with
her
eager
prefiguring
imagination
of
her
future
lot
and
her
anxiety
about
her
first
interview
with
philip
was
losing
its
predominance
perhaps
unconsciously
to
herself
she
was
not
sorry
that
the
interview
had
been
deferred
for
philip
had
not
come
the
evening
he
was
expected
and
stephen
guest
brought
word
that
he
was
gone
to
the
coast
probably
he
thought
on
a
sketching
expedition
but
it
was
not
certain
when
he
would
return
it
was
just
like
philip
to
go
off
in
that
way
without
telling
any
one
it
was
not
until
the
twelfth
day
that
he
returned
to
find
both
lucy
notes
awaiting
him
he
had
left
before
he
knew
of
maggie
arrival
perhaps
one
had
need
be
nineteen
again
to
be
quite
convinced
of
the
feelings
that
were
crowded
for
maggie
into
those
twelve
days
of
the
length
to
which
they
were
stretched
for
her
by
the
novelty
of
her
experience
in
them
and
the
varying
attitudes
of
her
mind
the
early
days
of
an
acquaintance
almost
always
have
this
importance
for
us
and
fill
up
a
larger
space
in
our
memory
than
longer
subsequent
periods
which
have
been
less
filled
with
discovery
and
new
impressions
there
were
not
many
hours
in
those
ten
days
in
which
stephen
guest
was
not
seated
by
lucy
side
or
standing
near
her
at
the
piano
or
accompanying
her
on
some
outdoor
excursion
his
attentions
were
clearly
becoming
more
assiduous
and
that
was
what
every
one
had
expected
lucy
was
very
happy
all
the
happier
because
society
seemed
to
have
become
much
more
interesting
and
amusing
since
maggie
had
been
there
playful
discussions
sometimes
serious
ones
were
going
forward
in
which
both
stephen
and
maggie
revealed
themselves
to
the
admiration
of
the
gentle
unobtrusive
lucy
and
it
more
than
once
crossed
her
mind
what
a
charming
quartet
they
should
have
through
life
when
maggie
married
philip
is
it
an
inexplicable
thing
that
a
girl
should
enjoy
her
lover
society
the
more
for
the
presence
of
a
third
person
and
be
without
the
slightest
spasm
of
jealousy
that
the
third
person
had
the
conversation
habitually
directed
to
her
not
when
that
girl
is
as
as
lucy
thoroughly
possessed
with
a
belief
that
she
knows
the
state
of
her
companions
affections
and
not
prone
to
the
feelings
which
shake
such
a
belief
in
the
absence
of
positive
evidence
against
it
besides
it
was
lucy
by
whom
stephen
sat
to
whom
he
gave
his
arm
to
whom
he
appealed
as
the
person
sure
to
agree
with
him
and
every
day
there
was
the
same
tender
politeness
toward
her
the
same
consciousness
of
her
wants
and
care
to
supply
them
was
there
really
the
same
it
seemed
to
lucy
that
there
was
more
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
real
significance
of
the
change
escaped
her
it
was
a
subtle
act
of
conscience
in
stephen
that
even
he
himself
was
not
aware
of
his
personal
attentions
to
maggie
were
comparatively
slight
and
there
had
even
sprung
up
an
apparent
distance
between
them
that
prevented
the
renewal
of
that
faint
resemblance
to
gallantry
into
which
he
had
fallen
the
first
day
in
the
boat
if
stephen
came
in
when
lucy
was
out
of
the
room
if
lucy
left
them
together
they
never
spoke
to
each
other
stephen
perhaps
seemed
to
be
examining
books
or
music
and
maggie
bent
her
head
assiduously
over
her
work
each
was
oppressively
conscious
of
the
other
presence
even
to
the
yet
each
looked
and
longed
for
the
same
thing
to
happen
the
next
day
neither
of
them
had
begun
to
reflect
on
the
matter
or
silently
to
ask
to
what
does
all
this
tend
maggie
only
felt
that
life
was
revealing
something
quite
new
to
her
and
she
was
absorbed
in
the
direct
immediate
experience
without
any
energy
left
for
taking
account
of
it
and
reasoning
about
it
stephen
wilfully
abstained
from
and
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
felt
an
influence
which
was
to
have
any
determining
effect
on
his
conduct
and
when
lucy
came
into
the
room
again
they
were
once
more
unconstrained
maggie
could
contradict
stephen
and
laugh
at
him
and
he
could
recommend
to
her
consideration
the
example
of
that
most
charming
heroine
miss
sophia
western
who
had
a
great
respect
for
the
understandings
of
men
maggie
could
look
at
stephen
which
for
some
reason
or
other
she
always
avoided
when
they
were
alone
and
he
could
even
ask
her
to
play
his
accompaniment
for
him
since
lucy
fingers
were
so
busy
with
that
and
lecture
her
on
hurrying
the
tempo
which
was
certainly
maggie
weak
point
one
day
it
was
the
day
of
philip
return
lucy
had
formed
a
sudden
engagement
to
spend
the
evening
with
kenn
whose
delicate
state
of
health
threatening
to
become
confirmed
illness
through
an
attack
of
bronchitis
obliged
her
to
resign
her
functions
at
the
coming
bazaar
into
the
hands
of
other
ladies
of
whom
she
wished
lucy
to
be
one
the
engagement
had
been
formed
in
stephen
presence
and
he
had
heard
lucy
promise
to
dine
early
and
call
at
six
for
miss
torry
who
brought
kenn
request
here
is
another
of
the
moral
results
of
this
idiotic
bazaar
stephen
burst
forth
as
soon
as
miss
torry
had
left
the
room
taking
young
ladies
from
the
duties
of
the
domestic
hearth
into
scenes
of
dissipation
among
and
embroidered
reticules
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
the
proper
function
of
women
if
it
is
not
to
make
reasons
for
husbands
to
stay
at
home
and
still
stronger
reasons
for
bachelors
to
go
out
if
this
goes
on
much
longer
the
bonds
of
society
will
be
dissolved
well
it
will
not
go
on
much
longer
said
lucy
laughing
for
the
bazaar
is
to
take
place
on
monday
week
thank
heaven
said
stephen
kenn
himself
said
the
other
day
that
he
did
like
this
plan
of
making
vanity
do
the
work
of
charity
but
just
as
the
british
public
is
not
reasonable
enough
to
bear
direct
taxation
so
ogg
has
not
got
force
of
motive
enough
to
build
and
endow
schools
without
calling
in
the
force
of
folly
did
he
say
so
said
little
lucy
her
hazel
eyes
opening
wide
with
anxiety
i
never
heard
him
say
anything
of
that
kind
i
thought
he
approved
of
what
we
were
doing
i
sure
he
approves
said
stephen
smiling
at
her
affectionately
your
conduct
in
going
out
looks
vicious
i
own
but
i
know
there
is
benevolence
at
the
bottom
of
it
oh
you
think
too
well
of
me
said
lucy
shaking
her
head
with
a
pretty
blush
and
there
the
subject
ended
but
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
stephen
would
not
come
in
the
evening
and
on
the
strength
of
that
tacit
understanding
he
made
his
morning
visit
the
longer
not
saying
until
after
four
maggie
was
seated
in
the
alone
shortly
after
dinner
with
minny
on
her
lap
having
left
her
uncle
to
his
wine
and
his
nap
and
her
mother
to
the
compromise
between
knitting
and
nodding
which
when
there
was
no
company
she
always
carried
on
in
the
till
maggie
was
stooping
to
caress
the
tiny
silken
pet
and
comforting
him
for
his
mistress
absence
when
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
gravel
made
her
look
up
and
she
saw
stephen
guest
walking
up
the
garden
as
if
he
had
come
straight
from
the
river
it
was
very
unusual
to
see
him
so
soon
after
dinner
he
often
complained
that
their
was
late
at
park
house
nevertheless
there
he
was
in
his
black
dress
he
had
evidently
been
home
and
must
have
come
again
by
the
river
maggie
felt
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
heart
beating
it
was
natural
she
should
be
nervous
for
she
was
not
accustomed
to
receive
visitors
alone
he
had
seen
her
look
up
through
the
open
window
and
raised
his
hat
as
he
walked
toward
it
to
enter
that
way
instead
of
by
the
door
he
blushed
too
and
certainly
looked
as
foolish
as
a
young
man
of
some
wit
and
can
be
expected
to
look
as
he
walked
in
with
a
roll
of
music
in
his
hand
and
said
with
an
air
of
hesitating
improvisation
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
again
miss
tulliver
i
ought
to
apologize
for
coming
upon
you
by
surprise
but
i
wanted
to
come
into
the
town
and
i
got
our
man
to
row
me
so
i
thought
i
would
bring
these
things
from
the
of
artois
for
your
cousin
i
forgot
them
this
morning
will
you
give
them
to
her
yes
said
maggie
who
had
risen
confusedly
with
minny
in
her
arms
and
now
not
quite
knowing
what
else
to
do
sat
down
again
stephen
laid
down
his
hat
with
the
music
which
rolled
on
the
floor
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
close
by
her
he
had
never
done
so
before
and
both
he
and
maggie
were
quite
aware
that
it
was
an
entirely
new
position
well
you
pampered
minion
said
stephen
leaning
to
pull
the
long
curly
ears
that
drooped
over
maggie
arm
it
was
not
a
suggestive
remark
and
as
the
speaker
did
not
follow
it
up
by
further
development
it
naturally
left
the
conversation
at
a
standstill
it
seemed
to
stephen
like
some
action
in
a
dream
that
he
was
obliged
to
do
and
wonder
at
himself
all
the
while
to
go
on
stroking
head
yet
it
was
very
pleasant
he
only
wished
he
dared
look
at
maggie
and
that
she
would
look
at
him
let
him
have
one
long
look
into
those
deep
strange
eyes
of
hers
and
then
he
would
be
satisfied
and
quite
reasonable
after
that
he
thought
it
was
becoming
a
sort
of
monomania
with
him
to
want
that
long
look
from
maggie
and
he
was
racking
his
invention
continually
to
find
out
some
means
by
which
he
could
have
it
without
its
appearing
singular
and
entailing
subsequent
embarrassment
as
for
maggie
she
had
no
distinct
thought
only
the
sense
of
a
presence
like
that
of
a
closely
hovering
bird
in
the
darkness
for
she
was
unable
to
look
up
and
saw
nothing
but
minny
black
wavy
coat
but
this
must
end
some
time
perhaps
it
ended
very
soon
and
only
long
as
a
minute
dream
does
stephen
at
last
sat
upright
sideways
in
his
chair
leaning
one
hand
and
arm
over
the
back
and
looking
at
maggie
what
should
he
say
we
shall
have
a
splendid
sunset
i
think
you
go
out
and
see
it
i
do
know
said
maggie
then
courageously
raising
her
eyes
and
looking
out
of
the
window
if
i
not
playing
cribbage
with
my
uncle
a
pause
during
which
minny
is
stroked
again
but
has
sufficient
insight
not
to
be
grateful
for
it
to
growl
rather
do
you
like
sitting
alone
a
rather
arch
look
came
over
maggie
face
and
just
glancing
at
stephen
she
said
would
it
be
quite
civil
to
say
it
rather
a
dangerous
question
for
an
intruder
to
ask
said
stephen
delighted
with
that
glance
and
getting
determined
to
stay
for
another
but
you
will
have
more
than
half
an
hour
to
yourself
after
i
am
gone
he
added
taking
out
his
watch
i
know
deane
never
comes
in
till
seven
another
pause
during
which
maggie
looked
steadily
out
of
the
window
till
by
a
great
effort
she
moved
her
head
to
look
down
at
minny
back
again
and
said
i
wish
lucy
had
not
been
obliged
to
go
out
we
lose
our
music
we
shall
have
a
new
voice
night
said
stephen
will
you
tell
your
cousin
that
our
friend
philip
wakem
is
come
back
i
saw
him
as
i
went
home
maggie
gave
a
little
start
it
seemed
hardly
more
than
a
vibration
that
passed
from
head
to
foot
in
an
instant
but
the
new
images
summoned
by
philip
name
dispersed
half
the
oppressive
spell
she
had
been
under
she
rose
from
her
chair
with
a
sudden
resolution
and
laying
minny
on
his
cushion
went
to
reach
lucy
large
from
its
corner
stephen
was
vexed
and
disappointed
he
thought
perhaps
maggie
did
like
the
name
of
wakem
to
be
mentioned
to
her
in
that
abrupt
way
for
he
now
recalled
what
lucy
had
told
him
of
the
family
quarrel
it
was
of
no
use
to
stay
any
longer
maggie
was
seating
herself
at
the
table
with
her
work
and
looking
chill
and
proud
and
he
he
looked
like
a
simpleton
for
having
come
a
gratuitous
entirely
superfluous
visit
of
that
sort
was
sure
to
make
a
man
disagreeable
and
ridiculous
of
course
it
was
palpable
to
thinking
that
he
had
dined
hastily
in
his
own
room
for
the
sake
of
setting
off
again
and
finding
her
alone
a
boyish
state
of
mind
for
an
accomplished
young
gentleman
of
not
without
legal
knowledge
but
a
reference
to
history
perhaps
may
make
it
not
incredible
at
this
moment
maggie
ball
of
rolled
along
the
ground
and
she
started
up
to
reach
it
stephen
rose
too
and
picking
up
the
ball
met
her
with
a
vexed
complaining
look
that
gave
his
eyes
quite
a
new
expression
to
maggie
whose
own
eyes
met
them
as
he
presented
the
ball
to
her
said
stephen
in
a
tone
that
had
the
same
beseeching
discontent
as
his
eyes
he
dared
not
put
out
his
hand
he
thrust
both
hands
into
his
as
he
spoke
maggie
thought
she
had
perhaps
been
rude
wo
you
stay
she
said
timidly
not
looking
away
for
that
would
have
seemed
rude
again
no
thank
you
said
stephen
looking
still
into
the
eyes
as
a
thirsty
man
looks
toward
the
track
of
the
distant
brook
the
boat
is
waiting
for
me
you
tell
your
cousin
yes
that
i
brought
the
music
i
mean
yes
and
that
philip
is
come
back
yes
maggie
did
not
notice
philip
name
this
time
wo
you
come
out
a
little
way
into
the
garden
said
stephen
in
a
still
gentler
tone
but
the
next
moment
he
was
vexed
that
she
did
not
say
no
for
she
moved
away
now
toward
the
open
window
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
his
hat
and
walk
by
her
side
but
he
thought
of
something
to
make
him
amends
do
take
my
arm
he
said
in
a
low
tone
as
if
it
were
a
secret
there
is
something
strangely
winning
to
most
women
in
that
offer
of
the
firm
arm
the
help
is
not
wanted
physically
at
that
moment
but
the
sense
of
help
the
presence
of
strength
that
is
outside
them
and
yet
theirs
meets
a
continual
want
of
the
imagination
either
on
that
ground
or
some
other
maggie
took
the
arm
and
they
walked
together
round
the
grassplot
and
under
the
drooping
green
of
the
laburnums
in
the
same
dim
dreamy
state
as
they
had
been
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
only
that
stephen
had
had
the
look
he
longed
for
without
yet
perceiving
in
himself
the
symptoms
of
returning
reasonableness
and
maggie
had
darting
thoughts
across
the
dimness
how
came
he
to
be
there
why
had
she
come
out
not
a
word
was
spoken
if
it
had
been
each
would
have
been
less
intensely
conscious
of
the
other
take
care
of
this
step
said
stephen
at
last
oh
i
will
go
in
now
said
maggie
feeling
that
the
step
had
come
like
a
rescue
in
an
instant
she
had
withdrawn
her
arm
and
was
running
back
to
the
house
she
did
not
reflect
that
this
sudden
action
would
only
add
to
the
embarrassing
recollections
of
the
last
she
had
no
thought
left
for
that
she
only
threw
herself
into
the
low
and
burst
into
tears
oh
philip
philip
i
wish
we
were
together
again
so
quietly
in
the
red
deeps
stephen
looked
after
her
a
moment
then
went
on
to
the
boat
and
was
soon
landed
at
the
wharf
he
spent
the
evening
in
the
smoking
one
cigar
after
another
and
losing
lives
at
pool
but
he
would
not
leave
off
he
was
determined
not
to
think
not
to
admit
any
more
distinct
remembrance
than
was
urged
upon
him
by
the
perpetual
presence
of
maggie
he
was
looking
at
her
and
she
was
on
his
arm
but
there
came
the
necessity
of
walking
home
in
the
cool
starlight
and
with
it
the
necessity
of
cursing
his
own
folly
and
bitterly
determining
that
he
would
never
trust
himself
alone
with
maggie
again
it
was
all
madness
he
was
in
love
thoroughly
attached
to
lucy
and
engaged
engaged
as
strongly
as
an
honorable
man
need
be
he
wished
he
had
never
seen
this
maggie
tulliver
to
be
thrown
into
a
fever
by
her
in
this
way
she
would
make
a
sweet
strange
troublesome
adorable
wife
to
some
man
or
other
but
he
would
never
have
chosen
her
himself
did
she
feel
as
he
did
he
hoped
she
did
not
he
ought
not
to
have
gone
he
would
master
himself
in
future
he
would
make
himself
disagreeable
to
her
quarrel
with
her
perhaps
quarrel
with
her
was
it
possible
to
quarrel
with
a
creature
who
had
such
eyes
defying
and
deprecating
contradicting
and
clinging
imperious
and
beseeching
full
of
delicious
opposites
to
see
such
a
creature
subdued
by
love
for
one
would
be
a
lot
worth
having
to
another
man
there
was
a
muttered
exclamation
which
ended
this
inward
soliloquy
as
stephen
threw
away
the
end
of
his
last
cigar
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
stalked
along
at
a
quieter
pace
through
the
shrubbery
it
was
not
of
a
benedictory
kind
chapter
vii
philip
the
next
morning
was
very
wet
the
sort
of
morning
on
which
male
neighbors
who
have
no
imperative
occupation
at
home
are
likely
to
pay
their
fair
friends
an
illimitable
visit
the
rain
which
has
been
endurable
enough
for
the
walk
or
ride
one
way
is
sure
to
become
so
heavy
and
at
the
same
time
so
certain
to
clear
up
by
and
by
that
nothing
but
an
open
quarrel
can
abbreviate
the
visit
latent
detestation
will
not
do
at
all
and
if
people
happen
to
be
lovers
what
can
be
so
delightful
in
england
as
a
rainy
morning
english
sunshine
is
dubious
bonnets
are
never
quite
secure
and
if
you
sit
down
on
the
grass
it
may
lead
to
catarrhs
but
the
rain
is
to
be
depended
on
you
gallop
through
it
in
a
mackintosh
and
presently
find
yourself
in
the
seat
you
like
best
a
little
above
or
a
little
below
the
one
on
which
your
goddess
sits
it
is
the
same
thing
to
the
metaphysical
mind
and
that
is
the
reason
why
women
are
at
once
worshipped
and
looked
down
upon
with
a
satisfactory
confidence
that
there
will
be
no
stephen
will
come
earlier
this
morning
i
know
said
lucy
he
always
does
when
it
rainy
maggie
made
no
answer
she
was
angry
with
stephen
she
began
to
think
she
should
dislike
him
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rain
she
would
have
gone
to
her
aunt
glegg
this
morning
and
so
have
avoided
him
altogether
as
it
was
she
must
find
some
reason
for
remaining
out
of
the
room
with
her
mother
but
stephen
did
not
come
earlier
and
there
was
another
visitor
a
nearer
neighbor
who
preceded
him
when
philip
entered
the
room
he
was
going
merely
to
bow
to
maggie
feeling
that
their
acquaintance
was
a
secret
which
he
was
bound
not
to
betray
but
when
she
advanced
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
he
guessed
at
once
that
lucy
had
been
taken
into
her
confidence
it
was
a
moment
of
some
agitation
to
both
though
philip
had
spent
many
hours
in
preparing
for
it
but
like
all
persons
who
have
passed
through
life
with
little
expectation
of
sympathy
he
seldom
lost
his
and
shrank
with
the
most
sensitive
pride
from
any
noticeable
betrayal
of
emotion
a
little
extra
paleness
a
little
tension
of
the
nostril
when
he
spoke
and
the
voice
pitched
in
rather
a
higher
key
that
to
strangers
would
seem
expressive
of
cold
indifference
were
all
the
signs
philip
usually
gave
of
an
inward
drama
that
was
not
without
its
fierceness
but
maggie
who
had
little
more
power
of
concealing
the
impressions
made
upon
her
than
if
she
had
been
constructed
of
musical
strings
felt
her
eyes
getting
larger
with
tears
as
they
took
each
other
hands
in
silence
they
were
not
painful
tears
they
had
rather
something
of
the
same
origin
as
the
tears
women
and
children
shed
when
they
have
found
some
protection
to
cling
to
and
look
back
on
the
threatened
danger
for
philip
who
a
little
while
ago
was
associated
continually
in
maggie
mind
with
the
sense
that
tom
might
reproach
her
with
some
justice
had
now
in
this
short
space
become
a
sort
of
outward
conscience
to
her
that
she
might
fly
to
for
rescue
and
strength
her
tranquil
tender
affection
for
philip
with
its
root
deep
down
in
her
childhood
and
its
memories
of
long
quiet
talk
confirming
by
distinct
successive
impressions
the
first
instinctive
bias
the
fact
that
in
him
the
appeal
was
more
strongly
to
her
pity
and
womanly
devotedness
than
to
her
vanity
or
other
egoistic
excitability
of
her
nature
seemed
now
to
make
a
sort
of
sacred
place
a
sanctuary
where
she
could
find
refuge
from
an
alluring
influence
which
the
best
part
of
herself
must
resist
which
must
bring
horrible
tumult
within
wretchedness
without
this
new
sense
of
her
relation
to
philip
nullified
the
anxious
scruples
she
would
otherwise
have
felt
lest
she
should
overstep
the
limit
of
intercourse
with
him
that
tom
would
sanction
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
and
felt
the
tears
in
her
eyes
without
any
consciousness
of
an
inward
check
the
scene
was
just
what
lucy
expected
and
her
kind
heart
delighted
in
bringing
philip
and
maggie
together
again
though
even
with
all
regard
for
philip
she
could
not
resist
the
impression
that
her
cousin
tom
had
some
excuse
for
feeling
shocked
at
the
physical
incongruity
between
the
two
a
prosaic
person
like
cousin
tom
who
did
like
poetry
and
fairy
tales
but
she
began
to
speak
as
soon
as
possible
to
set
them
at
ease
this
was
very
good
and
virtuous
of
you
she
said
in
her
pretty
treble
like
the
low
conversational
notes
of
little
birds
to
come
so
soon
after
your
arrival
and
as
it
is
i
think
i
will
pardon
you
for
running
away
in
an
inopportune
manner
and
giving
your
friends
no
notice
come
and
sit
down
here
she
went
on
placing
the
chair
that
would
suit
him
best
and
you
shall
find
yourself
treated
mercifully
you
will
never
govern
well
miss
deane
said
philip
as
he
seated
himself
because
no
one
will
ever
believe
in
your
severity
people
will
always
encourage
themselves
in
misdemeanors
by
the
certainty
that
you
will
be
indulgent
lucy
gave
some
playful
contradiction
but
philip
did
not
hear
what
it
was
for
he
had
naturally
turned
toward
maggie
and
she
was
looking
at
him
with
that
open
affectionate
scrutiny
which
we
give
to
a
friend
from
whom
we
have
been
long
separated
what
a
moment
their
parting
had
been
and
philip
felt
as
if
he
were
only
in
the
morrow
of
it
he
felt
this
so
keenly
with
such
intense
detailed
remembrance
with
such
passionate
revival
of
all
that
had
been
said
and
looked
in
their
last
conversation
that
with
that
jealousy
and
distrust
which
in
diffident
natures
is
almost
inevitably
linked
with
a
strong
feeling
he
thought
he
read
in
maggie
glance
and
manner
the
evidence
of
a
change
the
very
fact
that
he
feared
and
half
expected
it
would
be
sure
to
make
this
thought
rush
in
in
the
absence
of
positive
proof
to
the
contrary
i
am
having
a
great
holiday
am
i
not
said
maggie
lucy
is
like
a
fairy
godmother
she
has
turned
me
from
a
drudge
into
a
princess
in
no
time
i
do
nothing
but
indulge
myself
all
day
long
and
she
always
finds
out
what
i
want
before
i
know
it
myself
i
am
sure
she
is
the
happier
for
having
you
then
said
philip
you
must
be
better
than
a
whole
menagerie
of
pets
to
her
and
you
look
well
you
are
benefiting
by
the
change
artificial
conversation
of
this
sort
went
on
a
little
while
till
lucy
determined
to
put
an
end
to
it
exclaimed
with
a
good
imitation
of
annoyance
that
she
had
forgotten
something
and
was
quickly
out
of
the
room
in
a
moment
maggie
and
philip
leaned
forward
and
the
hands
were
clasped
again
with
a
look
of
sad
contentment
like
that
of
friends
who
meet
in
the
memory
of
recent
sorrow
i
told
my
brother
i
wished
to
see
you
philip
i
asked
him
to
release
me
from
my
promise
and
he
consented
maggie
in
her
impulsiveness
wanted
philip
to
know
at
once
the
position
they
must
hold
toward
each
other
but
she
checked
herself
the
things
that
had
happened
since
he
had
spoken
of
his
love
for
her
were
so
painful
that
she
shrank
from
being
the
first
to
allude
to
them
it
seemed
almost
like
an
injury
toward
philip
even
to
mention
her
brother
her
brother
who
had
insulted
him
but
he
was
thinking
too
entirely
of
her
to
be
sensitive
on
any
other
point
at
that
moment
then
we
can
at
least
be
friends
maggie
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
that
now
will
not
your
father
object
said
maggie
withdrawing
her
hand
i
should
not
give
you
up
on
any
ground
but
your
own
wish
maggie
said
philip
coloring
there
are
points
on
which
i
should
always
resist
my
father
as
i
used
to
tell
you
is
one
then
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
our
being
friends
philip
seeing
each
other
and
talking
to
each
other
while
i
am
here
i
shall
soon
go
away
again
i
mean
to
go
very
soon
to
a
new
situation
is
that
inevitable
maggie
yes
i
must
not
stay
here
long
it
would
unfit
me
for
the
life
i
must
begin
again
at
last
i
ca
live
in
dependence
i
ca
live
with
my
brother
though
he
is
very
good
to
me
he
would
like
to
provide
for
me
but
that
would
be
intolerable
to
me
philip
was
silent
a
few
moments
and
then
said
in
that
high
feeble
voice
which
with
him
indicated
the
resolute
suppression
of
emotion
is
there
no
other
alternative
maggie
is
that
life
away
from
those
who
love
you
the
only
one
you
will
allow
yourself
to
look
forward
to
yes
philip
she
said
looking
at
him
pleadingly
as
if
she
entreated
him
to
believe
that
she
was
compelled
to
this
course
at
least
as
things
are
i
do
know
what
may
be
in
years
to
come
but
i
begin
to
think
there
can
never
come
much
happiness
to
me
from
loving
i
have
always
had
so
much
pain
mingled
with
it
i
wish
i
could
make
myself
a
world
outside
it
as
men
do
now
you
are
returning
to
your
old
thought
in
a
new
form
maggie
the
thought
i
used
to
combat
said
philip
with
a
slight
tinge
of
bitterness
you
want
to
find
out
a
mode
of
renunciation
that
will
be
an
escape
from
pain
i
tell
you
again
there
is
no
such
escape
possible
except
by
perverting
or
mutilating
one
nature
what
would
become
of
me
if
i
tried
to
escape
from
pain
scorn
and
cynicism
would
be
my
only
opium
unless
i
could
fall
into
some
kind
of
conceited
madness
and
fancy
myself
a
favorite
of
heaven
because
i
am
not
a
favorite
with
men
the
bitterness
had
taken
on
some
impetuosity
as
philip
went
on
speaking
the
words
were
evidently
an
outlet
for
some
immediate
feeling
of
his
own
as
well
as
an
answer
to
maggie
there
was
a
pain
pressing
on
him
at
that
moment
he
shrank
with
proud
delicacy
from
the
faintest
allusion
to
the
words
of
love
of
plighted
love
that
had
passed
between
them
it
would
have
seemed
to
him
like
reminding
maggie
of
a
promise
it
would
have
had
for
him
something
of
the
baseness
of
compulsion
he
could
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
he
himself
had
not
changed
for
that
too
would
have
had
the
air
of
an
appeal
his
love
for
maggie
was
stamped
even
more
than
the
rest
of
his
experience
with
the
exaggerated
sense
that
he
was
an
exception
that
she
that
every
one
saw
him
in
the
light
of
an
exception
but
maggie
was
yes
philip
she
said
with
her
childish
contrition
when
he
used
to
chide
her
you
are
right
i
know
i
do
always
think
too
much
of
my
own
feelings
and
not
enough
of
others
not
enough
of
yours
i
had
need
have
you
always
to
find
fault
with
me
and
teach
me
so
many
things
have
come
true
that
you
used
to
tell
me
maggie
was
resting
her
elbow
on
the
table
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
and
looking
at
philip
with
dependent
affection
as
she
said
this
while
he
was
returning
her
gaze
with
an
expression
that
to
her
consciousness
gradually
became
less
vague
became
charged
with
a
specific
recollection
had
his
mind
flown
back
to
something
that
now
remembered
something
about
a
lover
of
lucy
it
was
a
thought
that
made
her
shudder
it
gave
new
definiteness
to
her
present
position
and
to
the
tendency
of
what
had
happened
the
evening
before
she
moved
her
arm
from
the
table
urged
to
change
her
position
by
that
positive
physical
oppression
at
the
heart
that
sometimes
accompanies
a
sudden
mental
pang
what
is
the
matter
maggie
has
something
happened
philip
said
in
inexpressible
anxiety
his
imagination
being
only
too
ready
to
weave
everything
that
was
fatal
to
them
both
no
nothing
said
maggie
rousing
her
latent
will
philip
must
not
have
that
odious
thought
in
his
mind
she
would
banish
it
from
her
own
nothing
she
repeated
except
in
my
own
mind
you
used
to
say
i
should
feel
the
effect
of
my
starved
life
as
you
called
it
and
i
do
i
am
too
eager
in
my
enjoyment
of
music
and
all
luxuries
now
they
are
come
to
me
she
took
up
her
work
and
occupied
herself
resolutely
while
philip
watched
her
really
in
doubt
whether
she
had
anything
more
than
this
general
allusion
in
her
mind
it
was
quite
in
maggie
character
to
be
agitated
by
vague
but
soon
there
came
a
violent
ring
at
the
resounding
through
the
house
oh
what
a
startling
announcement
said
maggie
quite
mistress
of
herself
though
not
without
some
inward
flutter
i
wonder
where
lucy
is
lucy
had
not
been
deaf
to
the
signal
and
after
an
interval
long
enough
for
a
few
solicitous
but
not
hurried
inquiries
she
herself
ushered
stephen
in
well
old
fellow
he
said
going
straight
up
to
philip
and
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
bowing
to
maggie
in
passing
it
glorious
to
have
you
back
again
only
i
wish
you
conduct
yourself
a
little
less
like
a
sparrow
with
a
residence
on
the
and
not
go
in
and
out
constantly
without
letting
the
servants
know
this
is
about
the
twentieth
time
i
had
to
scamper
up
those
countless
stairs
to
that
of
yours
all
to
no
purpose
because
your
people
thought
you
were
at
home
such
incidents
embitter
friendship
i
so
few
visitors
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
leave
notice
of
my
exit
and
entrances
said
philip
feeling
rather
oppressed
just
then
by
stephen
bright
strong
presence
and
strong
voice
are
you
quite
well
this
morning
miss
tulliver
said
stephen
turning
to
maggie
with
stiff
politeness
and
putting
out
his
hand
with
the
air
of
fulfilling
a
social
duty
maggie
gave
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
said
quite
well
thank
you
in
a
tone
of
proud
indifference
philip
eyes
were
watching
them
keenly
but
lucy
was
used
to
seeing
variations
in
their
manner
to
each
other
and
only
thought
with
regret
that
there
was
some
natural
antipathy
which
every
now
and
then
surmounted
their
mutual
maggie
is
not
the
sort
of
woman
stephen
admires
and
she
is
irritated
by
something
in
him
which
she
interprets
as
conceit
was
the
silent
observation
that
accounted
for
everything
to
guileless
lucy
stephen
and
maggie
had
no
sooner
completed
this
studied
greeting
than
each
felt
hurt
by
the
other
coldness
and
stephen
while
rattling
on
in
questions
to
philip
about
his
recent
sketching
expedition
was
thinking
all
the
more
about
maggie
because
he
was
not
drawing
her
into
the
conversation
as
he
had
invariably
done
before
maggie
and
philip
are
not
looking
happy
thought
lucy
this
first
interview
has
been
saddening
to
them
i
think
we
people
who
have
not
been
galloping
she
said
to
stephen
are
all
a
little
damped
by
the
rain
let
us
have
some
music
we
ought
to
take
advantage
of
having
philip
and
you
together
give
us
the
duet
in
maggie
has
not
heard
that
and
i
know
it
will
suit
her
come
then
said
stephen
going
toward
the
piano
and
giving
a
foretaste
of
the
tune
in
his
deep
very
pleasant
to
hear
you
please
philip
you
play
the
accompaniment
said
lucy
and
then
i
can
go
on
with
my
work
you
like
to
play
you
she
added
with
a
pretty
inquiring
look
anxious
as
usual
lest
she
should
have
proposed
what
was
not
pleasant
to
another
but
with
yearnings
toward
her
unfinished
embroidery
philip
had
brightened
at
the
proposition
for
there
is
no
feeling
perhaps
except
the
extremes
of
fear
and
grief
that
does
not
find
relief
in
music
that
does
not
make
a
man
sing
or
play
the
better
and
philip
had
an
abundance
of
feeling
at
this
moment
as
complex
as
any
trio
or
quartet
that
was
ever
meant
to
express
love
and
jealousy
and
resignation
and
fierce
suspicion
all
at
the
same
time
oh
yes
he
said
seating
himself
at
the
piano
it
is
a
way
of
eking
out
one
imperfect
life
and
being
three
people
at
once
to
sing
and
make
the
piano
sing
and
hear
them
both
all
the
while
or
else
to
sing
and
paint
ah
there
you
are
an
enviable
fellow
i
can
do
nothing
with
my
hands
said
stephen
that
has
generally
been
observed
in
men
of
great
administrative
capacity
i
believe
a
tendency
to
predominance
of
the
reflective
powers
in
me
have
you
observed
that
miss
tulliver
stephen
had
fallen
by
mistake
into
his
habit
of
playful
appeal
to
maggie
and
she
could
not
repress
the
answering
flush
and
epigram
i
observed
a
tendency
to
predominance
she
said
smiling
and
philip
at
that
moment
devoutly
hoped
that
she
found
the
tendency
disagreeable
come
come
said
lucy
music
music
we
will
discuss
each
qualities
another
time
maggie
always
tried
in
vain
to
go
on
with
her
work
when
music
began
she
tried
harder
than
ever
for
the
thought
that
stephen
knew
how
much
she
cared
for
his
singing
was
one
that
no
longer
roused
a
merely
playful
resistance
and
she
knew
too
that
it
was
his
habit
always
to
stand
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
but
it
was
of
no
use
she
soon
threw
her
work
down
and
all
her
intentions
were
lost
in
the
vague
state
of
emotion
produced
by
the
inspiring
duet
emotion
that
seemed
to
make
her
at
once
strong
and
weak
strong
for
all
enjoyment
weak
for
all
resistance
when
the
strain
passed
into
the
minor
she
half
started
from
her
seat
with
the
sudden
thrill
of
that
change
poor
maggie
she
looked
very
beautiful
when
her
soul
was
being
played
on
in
this
way
by
the
inexorable
power
of
sound
you
might
have
seen
the
slightest
perceptible
quivering
through
her
whole
frame
as
she
leaned
a
little
forward
clasping
her
hands
as
if
to
steady
herself
while
her
eyes
dilated
and
brightened
into
that
childish
expression
of
wondering
delight
which
always
came
back
in
her
happiest
moments
lucy
who
at
other
times
had
always
been
at
the
piano
when
maggie
was
looking
in
this
way
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
steal
up
to
her
and
kiss
her
philip
too
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
now
and
then
round
the
open
book
on
the
desk
and
felt
that
he
had
never
before
seen
her
under
so
strong
an
influence
more
more
said
lucy
when
the
duet
had
been
encored
something
spirited
again
maggie
always
says
she
likes
a
great
rush
of
sound
it
must
be
us
take
the
road
then
said
stephen
so
suitable
for
a
wet
morning
but
are
you
prepared
to
abandon
the
most
sacred
duties
of
life
and
come
and
sing
with
us
oh
yes
said
lucy
laughing
if
you
will
look
out
the
opera
from
the
large
canterbury
it
has
a
dingy
cover
that
is
a
great
clue
considering
there
are
about
a
score
covers
here
of
rival
dinginess
said
stephen
drawing
out
the
canterbury
oh
play
something
the
while
philip
said
lucy
noticing
that
his
fingers
were
wandering
over
the
keys
what
is
that
you
are
falling
into
something
delicious
that
i
do
know
do
you
know
that
said
philip
bringing
out
the
tune
more
definitely
it
from
the
perchè
non
posso
odiarti
i
do
know
the
opera
but
it
appears
the
tenor
is
telling
the
heroine
that
he
shall
always
love
her
though
she
may
forsake
him
you
heard
me
sing
it
to
the
english
words
love
thee
still
it
was
not
quite
unintentionally
that
philip
had
wandered
into
this
song
which
might
be
an
indirect
expression
to
maggie
of
what
he
could
not
prevail
on
himself
to
say
to
her
directly
her
ears
had
been
open
to
what
he
was
saying
and
when
he
began
to
sing
she
understood
the
plaintive
passion
of
the
music
that
pleading
tenor
had
no
very
fine
qualities
as
a
voice
but
it
was
not
quite
new
to
her
it
had
sung
to
her
by
snatches
in
a
subdued
way
among
the
grassy
walks
and
hollows
and
underneath
the
leaning
in
the
red
deeps
there
seemed
to
be
some
reproach
in
the
words
did
philip
mean
that
she
wished
she
had
assured
him
more
distinctly
in
their
conversation
that
she
desired
not
to
renew
the
hope
of
love
between
them
because
it
clashed
with
her
inevitable
circumstances
she
was
touched
not
thrilled
by
the
song
it
suggested
distinct
memories
and
thoughts
and
brought
quiet
regret
in
the
place
of
excitement
that
the
way
with
you
tenors
said
stephen
who
was
waiting
with
music
in
his
hand
while
philip
finished
the
song
you
demoralize
the
fair
sex
by
warbling
your
sentimental
love
and
constancy
under
all
sorts
of
vile
treatment
nothing
short
of
having
your
heads
served
up
in
a
dish
like
that
mediæval
tenor
or
troubadour
would
prevent
you
from
expressing
your
entire
resignation
i
must
administer
an
antidote
while
miss
deane
prepares
to
tear
herself
away
from
her
bobbins
stephen
rolled
out
with
saucy
energy
shall
i
wasting
in
despair
die
because
a
woman
fair
and
seemed
to
make
all
the
air
in
the
room
alive
with
a
new
influence
lucy
always
proud
of
what
stephen
did
went
toward
the
piano
with
laughing
admiring
looks
at
him
and
maggie
in
spite
of
her
resistance
to
the
spirit
of
the
song
and
to
the
singer
was
taken
hold
of
and
shaken
by
the
invisible
influence
was
borne
along
by
a
wave
too
strong
for
her
but
angrily
resolved
not
to
betray
herself
she
seized
her
work
and
went
on
making
false
stitches
and
pricking
her
fingers
with
much
perseverance
not
looking
up
or
taking
notice
of
what
was
going
forward
until
all
the
three
voices
united
in
let
us
take
the
road
i
am
afraid
there
would
have
been
a
subtle
stealing
gratification
in
her
mind
if
she
had
known
how
entirely
this
saucy
defiant
stephen
was
occupied
with
her
how
he
was
passing
rapidly
from
a
determination
to
treat
her
with
ostentatious
indifference
to
an
irritating
desire
for
some
sign
of
inclination
from
her
some
interchange
of
subdued
word
or
look
with
her
it
was
not
long
before
he
found
an
opportunity
when
they
had
passed
to
the
music
of
the
tempest
maggie
feeling
the
need
of
a
footstool
was
walking
across
the
room
to
get
one
when
stephen
who
was
not
singing
just
then
and
was
conscious
of
all
her
movements
guessed
her
want
and
flew
to
anticipate
her
lifting
the
footstool
with
an
entreating
look
at
her
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
return
a
glance
of
gratitude
and
then
to
have
the
footstool
placed
carefully
by
a
too
personage
not
personage
but
one
in
particular
who
suddenly
looks
humble
and
anxious
and
lingers
bending
still
to
ask
if
there
is
not
some
draught
in
that
position
between
the
window
and
the
fireplace
and
if
he
may
not
be
allowed
to
move
the
for
her
these
things
will
summon
a
little
of
the
too
ready
traitorous
tenderness
into
a
woman
eyes
compelled
as
she
is
in
her
girlish
time
to
learn
her
in
very
trivial
language
and
to
maggie
such
things
had
not
been
incidents
but
were
a
new
element
in
her
life
and
found
her
keen
appetite
for
homage
quite
fresh
that
tone
of
gentle
solicitude
obliged
her
to
look
at
the
face
that
was
bent
toward
her
and
to
say
no
thank
you
and
nothing
could
prevent
that
mutual
glance
from
being
delicious
to
both
as
it
had
been
the
evening
before
it
was
but
an
ordinary
act
of
politeness
in
stephen
it
had
hardly
taken
two
minutes
and
lucy
who
was
singing
scarcely
noticed
it
but
to
philip
mind
filled
already
with
a
vague
anxiety
that
was
likely
to
find
a
definite
ground
for
itself
in
any
trivial
incident
this
sudden
eagerness
in
stephen
and
the
change
in
maggie
face
which
was
plainly
reflecting
a
beam
from
his
seemed
so
strong
a
contrast
with
the
previous
overwrought
signs
of
indifference
as
to
be
charged
with
painful
meaning
stephen
voice
pouring
in
again
jarred
upon
his
nervous
susceptibility
as
if
it
had
been
the
clang
of
and
he
felt
inclined
to
make
the
piano
shriek
in
utter
discord
he
had
really
seen
no
communicable
ground
for
suspecting
any
ususual
feeling
between
stephen
and
maggie
his
own
reason
told
him
so
and
he
wanted
to
go
home
at
once
that
he
might
reflect
coolly
on
these
false
images
till
he
had
convinced
himself
of
their
nullity
but
then
again
he
wanted
to
stay
as
long
as
stephen
stayed
always
to
be
present
when
stephen
was
present
with
maggie
it
seemed
to
poor
philip
so
natural
nay
inevitable
that
any
man
who
was
near
maggie
should
fall
in
love
with
her
there
was
no
promise
of
happiness
for
her
if
she
were
beguiled
into
loving
stephen
guest
and
this
thought
emboldened
philip
to
view
his
own
love
for
her
in
the
light
of
a
less
unequal
offering
he
was
beginning
to
play
very
falsely
under
this
deafening
inward
tumult
and
lucy
was
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
when
tulliver
entrance
to
summon
them
to
lunch
came
as
an
excuse
for
abruptly
breaking
off
the
music
ah
mr
philip
said
deane
when
they
entered
the
i
not
seen
you
for
a
long
while
your
father
not
at
home
i
think
is
he
i
went
after
him
to
the
office
the
other
day
and
they
said
he
was
out
of
town
he
been
to
mudport
on
business
for
several
days
said
philip
but
he
come
back
now
as
fond
of
his
farming
hobby
as
ever
eh
i
believe
so
said
philip
rather
wondering
at
this
sudden
interest
in
his
father
pursuits
ah
said
deane
he
got
some
land
in
his
own
hands
on
this
side
the
river
as
well
as
the
other
i
think
yes
he
has
ah
continued
deane
as
he
dispensed
the
pigeonpie
he
must
find
farming
a
heavy
item
an
expensive
hobby
i
never
had
a
hobby
myself
never
would
give
in
to
that
and
the
worst
of
all
hobbies
are
those
that
people
think
they
can
get
money
at
they
shoot
their
money
down
like
corn
out
of
a
sack
then
lucy
felt
a
little
nervous
under
her
father
apparently
gratuitous
criticism
of
wakem
expenditure
but
it
ceased
there
and
deane
became
unusually
silent
and
meditative
during
his
luncheon
lucy
accustomed
to
watch
all
indications
in
her
father
and
having
reasons
which
had
recently
become
strong
for
an
extra
interest
in
what
referred
to
the
wakems
felt
an
unusual
curiosity
to
know
what
had
prompted
her
father
questions
his
subsequent
silence
made
her
suspect
there
had
been
some
special
reason
for
them
in
his
mind
with
this
idea
in
her
head
she
resorted
to
her
usual
plan
when
she
wanted
to
tell
or
ask
her
father
anything
particular
she
found
a
reason
for
her
aunt
tulliver
to
leaving
the
after
dinner
and
seated
herself
on
a
small
stool
at
her
father
knee
deane
under
those
circumstances
considered
that
he
tasted
some
of
the
most
agreeable
moments
his
merits
had
purchased
him
in
life
notwithstanding
that
lucy
disliking
to
have
her
hair
powdered
with
snuff
usually
began
by
mastering
his
on
such
occasions
you
do
want
to
go
to
sleep
yet
papa
you
she
said
as
she
brought
up
her
stool
and
opened
the
large
fingers
that
clutched
the
not
yet
said
deane
glancing
at
the
reward
of
merit
in
the
decanter
but
what
do
want
he
added
pinching
the
dimpled
chin
fondly
to
coax
some
more
sovereigns
out
of
my
pocket
for
your
bazaar
eh
no
i
have
no
base
motives
at
all
i
only
want
to
talk
not
to
beg
i
want
to
know
what
made
you
ask
philip
wakem
about
his
farming
papa
it
seemed
rather
odd
because
you
never
hardly
say
anything
to
him
about
his
father
and
why
should
you
care
about
wakem
losing
money
by
his
hobby
something
to
do
with
business
said
deane
waving
his
hands
as
if
to
repel
intrusion
into
that
mystery
but
papa
you
always
say
wakem
has
brought
philip
up
like
a
girl
how
came
you
to
think
you
should
get
any
business
knowledge
out
of
him
those
abrupt
questions
sounded
rather
oddly
philip
thought
them
queer
nonsense
child
said
deane
willing
to
justify
his
social
demeanor
with
which
he
had
taken
some
pains
in
his
upward
progress
there
a
report
that
wakem
mill
and
farm
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
dorlcote
mill
your
uncle
tulliver
you
know
is
answering
so
well
as
it
did
i
wanted
to
see
if
your
friend
philip
would
let
anything
out
about
his
father
being
tired
of
farming
why
would
you
buy
the
mill
papa
if
he
would
part
with
it
said
lucy
eagerly
oh
tell
me
everything
here
you
shall
have
your
if
you
tell
me
because
maggie
says
all
their
hearts
are
set
on
tom
getting
back
the
mill
some
time
it
was
one
of
the
last
things
her
father
said
to
tom
that
he
must
get
back
the
mill
hush
you
little
puss
said
deane
availing
himself
of
the
restored
you
must
not
say
a
word
about
this
thing
do
you
hear
there
very
little
chance
of
their
getting
the
mill
or
of
anybody
getting
it
out
of
wakem
hands
and
if
he
knew
that
we
wanted
it
with
a
view
to
the
tulliver
getting
it
again
he
be
the
less
likely
to
part
with
it
it
natural
after
what
happened
he
behaved
well
enough
to
tulliver
before
but
a
horsewhipping
is
not
likely
to
be
paid
for
with
now
papa
said
lucy
with
a
little
air
of
solemnity
will
you
trust
me
you
must
not
ask
me
all
my
reasons
for
what
i
going
to
say
but
i
have
very
strong
reasons
and
i
very
cautious
i
am
indeed
well
let
us
hear
why
i
believe
if
you
will
let
me
take
philip
wakem
into
our
confidence
let
me
tell
him
all
about
your
wish
to
buy
and
what
for
that
my
cousins
wish
to
have
it
and
why
they
wish
to
have
it
i
believe
philip
would
help
to
bring
it
about
i
know
he
would
desire
to
do
it
i
do
see
how
that
can
be
child
said
deane
looking
puzzled
why
should
care
then
with
a
sudden
penetrating
look
at
his
daughter
you
do
think
the
poor
lad
fond
of
you
and
so
you
can
make
him
do
what
you
like
deane
felt
quite
safe
about
his
daughter
affections
no
papa
he
cares
very
little
about
me
not
so
much
as
i
care
about
him
but
i
have
a
reason
for
being
quite
sure
of
what
i
say
do
you
ask
me
and
if
you
ever
guess
do
tell
me
only
give
me
leave
to
do
as
i
think
fit
about
it
lucy
rose
from
her
stool
to
seat
herself
on
her
father
knee
and
kissed
him
with
that
last
request
are
you
sure
you
wo
do
mischief
now
he
said
looking
at
her
with
delight
yes
papa
quite
sure
i
very
wise
i
got
all
your
business
talents
did
you
admire
my
now
when
i
showed
it
you
well
well
if
this
youngster
will
keep
his
counsel
there
wo
be
much
harm
done
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
there
not
much
chance
for
us
any
other
way
now
let
me
go
off
to
sleep
chapter
viii
wakem
in
a
new
light
before
three
days
had
passed
after
the
conversation
you
have
just
overheard
between
lucy
and
her
father
she
had
contrived
to
have
a
private
interview
with
philip
during
a
visit
of
maggie
to
her
aunt
glegg
for
a
day
and
a
night
philip
turned
over
in
his
mind
with
restless
agitation
all
that
lucy
had
told
him
in
that
interview
till
he
had
thoroughly
resolved
on
a
course
of
action
he
thought
he
saw
before
him
now
a
possibility
of
altering
his
position
with
respect
to
maggie
and
removing
at
least
one
obstacle
between
them
he
laid
his
plan
and
calculated
all
his
moves
with
the
fervid
deliberation
of
a
in
the
days
of
his
first
ardor
and
was
amazed
himself
at
his
sudden
genius
as
a
tactician
his
plan
was
as
bold
as
it
was
thoroughly
calculated
having
watched
for
a
moment
when
his
father
had
nothing
more
urgent
on
his
hands
than
the
newspaper
he
went
behind
him
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
father
will
you
come
up
into
my
sanctum
and
look
at
my
new
sketches
i
arranged
them
now
i
getting
terrible
stiff
in
the
joints
phil
for
climbing
those
stairs
of
yours
said
wakem
looking
kindly
at
his
son
as
he
laid
down
his
paper
but
come
along
then
this
is
a
nice
place
for
you
is
it
phil
a
capital
light
that
from
the
roof
eh
was
as
usual
the
first
thing
he
said
on
entering
the
he
liked
to
remind
himself
and
his
son
too
that
his
fatherly
indulgence
had
provided
the
accommodation
he
had
been
a
good
father
emily
would
have
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
there
if
she
came
back
again
from
her
grave
come
come
he
said
putting
his
double
over
his
nose
and
seating
himself
to
take
a
general
view
while
he
rested
you
got
a
famous
show
here
upon
my
word
i
do
see
that
your
things
are
as
good
as
that
london
artist
what
his
name
that
leyburn
gave
so
much
money
for
philip
shook
his
head
and
smiled
he
had
seated
himself
on
his
and
had
taken
a
lead
pencil
in
his
hand
with
which
he
was
making
strong
marks
to
counteract
the
sense
of
tremulousness
he
watched
his
father
get
up
and
walk
slowly
round
dwelling
on
the
pictures
much
longer
than
his
amount
of
genuine
taste
for
landscape
would
have
prompted
till
he
stopped
before
a
stand
on
which
two
pictures
were
placed
one
much
larger
than
the
other
the
smaller
one
in
a
leather
case
bless
me
what
have
you
here
said
wakem
startled
by
a
sudden
transition
from
landscape
to
portrait
i
thought
you
left
off
figures
who
are
these
they
are
the
same
person
said
philip
with
calm
promptness
at
different
ages
and
what
person
said
wakem
sharply
fixing
his
eyes
with
a
growing
look
of
suspicion
on
the
larger
picture
miss
tulliver
the
small
one
is
something
like
what
she
was
when
i
was
at
school
with
her
brother
at
king
lorton
the
larger
one
is
not
quite
so
good
a
likeness
of
what
she
was
when
i
came
from
abroad
wakem
turned
round
fiercely
with
a
flushed
face
letting
his
fall
and
looking
at
his
son
with
a
savage
expression
for
a
moment
as
if
he
was
ready
to
strike
that
daring
feebleness
from
the
stool
but
he
threw
himself
into
the
armchair
again
and
thrust
his
hands
into
his
still
looking
angrily
at
his
son
however
philip
did
not
return
the
look
but
sat
quietly
watching
the
point
of
his
pencil
and
do
you
mean
to
say
then
that
you
have
had
any
acquaintance
with
her
since
you
came
from
abroad
said
wakem
at
last
with
that
vain
effort
which
rage
always
makes
to
throw
as
much
punishment
as
it
desires
to
inflict
into
words
and
tones
since
blows
are
forbidden
yes
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
her
for
a
whole
year
before
her
death
we
met
often
in
that
thicket
the
red
deeps
near
dorlcote
mill
i
love
her
dearly
i
shall
never
love
any
other
woman
i
have
thought
of
her
ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl
go
on
sir
and
you
have
corresponded
with
her
all
this
while
no
i
never
told
her
i
loved
her
till
just
before
we
parted
and
she
promised
her
brother
not
to
see
me
again
or
to
correspond
with
me
i
am
not
sure
that
she
loves
me
or
would
consent
to
marry
me
but
if
she
would
consent
if
she
love
me
well
enough
i
should
marry
her
and
this
is
the
return
you
make
me
for
all
the
indulgences
heaped
on
you
said
wakem
getting
white
and
beginning
to
tremble
under
an
enraged
sense
of
impotence
before
philip
calm
defiance
and
concentration
of
purpose
no
father
said
philip
looking
up
at
him
for
the
first
time
i
do
regard
it
as
a
return
you
have
been
an
indulgent
father
to
me
but
i
have
always
felt
that
it
was
because
you
had
an
affectionate
wish
to
give
me
as
much
happiness
as
my
unfortunate
lot
would
admit
not
that
it
was
a
debt
you
expected
me
to
pay
by
sacrificing
all
my
chances
of
happiness
to
satisfy
feelings
of
yours
which
i
can
never
share
i
think
most
sons
would
share
their
father
feelings
in
this
case
said
wakem
bitterly
the
girl
father
was
an
ignorant
mad
brute
who
was
within
an
inch
of
murdering
me
the
whole
town
knows
it
and
the
brother
is
just
as
insolent
only
in
a
cooler
way
he
forbade
her
seeing
you
you
say
he
break
every
bone
in
your
body
for
your
greater
happiness
if
you
do
take
care
but
you
seem
to
have
made
up
your
mind
you
have
counted
the
consequences
i
suppose
of
course
you
are
independent
of
me
you
can
marry
this
girl
if
you
like
you
are
a
man
of
you
can
go
your
way
and
i
can
go
mine
we
need
have
no
more
to
do
with
each
other
wakem
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
but
something
held
him
back
and
instead
of
leaving
the
room
he
walked
up
and
down
it
philip
was
slow
to
reply
and
when
he
spoke
his
tone
had
a
more
incisive
quietness
and
clearness
than
ever
no
i
ca
marry
miss
tulliver
even
if
she
would
have
me
if
i
have
only
my
own
resources
to
maintain
her
with
i
have
been
brought
up
to
no
profession
i
ca
offer
her
poverty
as
well
as
deformity
ah
is
a
reason
for
your
clinging
to
me
doubtless
said
wakem
still
bitterly
though
philip
last
words
had
given
him
a
pang
they
had
stirred
a
feeling
which
had
been
a
habit
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
he
threw
himself
into
the
chair
again
i
expected
all
this
said
philip
i
know
these
scenes
are
often
happening
between
father
and
son
if
i
were
like
other
men
of
my
age
i
might
answer
your
angry
words
by
still
angrier
we
might
part
i
should
marry
the
woman
i
love
and
have
a
chance
of
being
as
happy
as
the
rest
but
if
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
annihilate
the
very
object
of
everything
you
done
for
me
you
have
an
advantage
over
most
fathers
you
can
completely
deprive
me
of
the
only
thing
that
would
make
my
life
worth
having
philip
paused
but
his
father
was
silent
you
know
best
what
satisfaction
you
would
have
beyond
that
of
gratifying
a
ridiculous
rancor
worthy
only
of
wandering
savages
ridiculous
rancor
wakem
burst
out
what
do
you
mean
damn
it
is
a
man
to
be
horsewhipped
by
a
boor
and
love
him
for
it
besides
that
cold
proud
devil
of
a
son
who
said
a
word
to
me
i
shall
not
forget
when
we
had
the
settling
he
would
be
as
pleasant
a
mark
for
a
bullet
as
i
know
if
he
were
worth
the
expense
i
do
mean
your
resentment
toward
them
said
philip
who
had
his
reasons
for
some
sympathy
with
this
view
of
tom
though
a
feeling
of
revenge
is
not
worth
much
that
you
should
care
to
keep
it
i
mean
your
extending
the
enmity
to
a
helpless
girl
who
has
too
much
sense
and
goodness
to
share
their
narrow
prejudices
has
never
entered
into
the
family
quarrels
what
does
that
signify
we
do
ask
what
a
woman
does
we
ask
whom
she
belongs
to
it
altogether
a
degrading
thing
to
you
to
think
of
marrying
old
tulliver
daughter
for
the
first
time
in
the
dialogue
philip
lost
some
of
his
and
colored
with
anger
miss
tulliver
he
said
with
bitter
incisiveness
has
the
only
grounds
of
rank
that
anything
but
vulgar
folly
can
suppose
to
belong
to
the
middle
class
she
is
thoroughly
refined
and
her
friends
whatever
else
they
may
be
are
respected
for
irreproachable
honor
and
integrity
all
ogg
i
fancy
would
pronounce
her
to
be
more
than
my
equal
wakem
darted
a
glance
of
fierce
question
at
his
son
but
philip
was
not
looking
at
him
and
with
a
certain
penitent
consciousness
went
on
in
a
few
moments
as
if
in
amplification
of
his
last
words
find
a
single
person
in
ogg
who
will
not
tell
you
that
a
beautiful
creature
like
her
would
be
throwing
herself
away
on
a
pitiable
object
like
me
not
she
said
wakem
rising
again
and
forgetting
everything
else
in
a
burst
of
resentful
pride
half
fatherly
half
personal
it
would
be
a
deuced
fine
match
for
her
it
all
stuff
about
an
accidental
deformity
when
a
girl
really
attached
to
a
man
but
girls
are
not
apt
to
get
attached
under
those
circumstances
said
philip
well
then
said
wakem
rather
brutally
trying
to
recover
his
previous
position
if
she
does
care
for
you
you
might
have
spared
yourself
the
trouble
of
talking
to
me
about
her
and
you
might
have
spared
me
the
trouble
of
refusing
my
consent
to
what
was
never
likely
to
happen
wakem
strode
to
the
door
and
without
looking
round
again
banged
it
after
him
philip
was
not
without
confidence
that
his
father
would
be
ultimately
wrought
upon
as
he
had
expected
by
what
had
passed
but
the
scene
had
jarred
upon
his
nerves
which
were
as
sensitive
as
a
woman
he
determined
not
to
go
down
to
dinner
he
could
meet
his
father
again
that
day
it
was
wakem
habit
when
he
had
no
company
at
home
to
go
out
in
the
evening
often
as
early
as
seven
and
as
it
was
far
on
in
the
afternoon
now
philip
locked
up
his
room
and
went
out
for
a
long
ramble
thinking
he
would
not
return
until
his
father
was
out
of
the
house
again
he
got
into
a
boat
and
went
down
the
river
to
a
favorite
village
where
he
dined
and
lingered
till
it
was
late
enough
for
him
to
return
he
had
never
had
any
sort
of
quarrel
with
his
father
before
and
had
a
sickening
fear
that
this
contest
just
begun
might
go
on
for
weeks
and
what
might
not
happen
in
that
time
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
define
what
that
involuntary
question
meant
but
if
he
could
once
be
in
the
position
of
maggie
accepted
acknowledged
lover
there
would
be
less
room
for
vague
dread
he
went
up
to
his
again
and
threw
himself
with
a
sense
of
fatigue
into
the
armchair
looking
round
absently
at
the
views
of
water
and
rock
that
were
ranged
around
till
he
fell
into
a
doze
in
which
he
fancied
maggie
was
slipping
down
a
glistening
green
slimy
channel
of
a
waterfall
and
he
was
looking
on
helpless
till
he
was
awakened
by
what
seemed
a
sudden
awful
crash
it
was
the
opening
of
the
door
and
he
could
hardly
have
dozed
more
than
a
few
moments
for
there
was
no
perceptible
change
in
the
evening
light
it
was
his
father
who
entered
and
when
philip
moved
to
vacate
the
chair
for
him
he
said
sit
still
i
rather
walk
about
he
stalked
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
and
then
standing
opposite
philip
with
his
hands
thrust
in
his
side
pockets
he
said
as
if
continuing
a
conversation
that
had
not
been
broken
off
but
this
girl
seems
to
have
been
fond
of
you
phil
else
she
have
met
you
in
that
way
philip
heart
was
beating
rapidly
and
a
transient
flush
passed
over
his
face
like
a
gleam
it
was
not
quite
easy
to
speak
at
once
she
liked
me
at
king
lorton
when
she
was
a
little
girl
because
i
used
to
sit
with
her
brother
a
great
deal
when
he
had
hurt
his
foot
she
had
kept
that
in
her
memory
and
thought
of
me
as
a
friend
of
a
long
while
ago
she
did
think
of
me
as
a
lover
when
she
met
me
well
but
you
made
love
to
her
at
last
what
did
she
say
then
said
wakem
walking
about
again
she
said
she
love
me
then
confound
it
then
what
else
do
you
want
is
she
a
jilt
she
was
very
young
then
said
philip
hesitatingly
i
afraid
she
hardly
knew
what
she
felt
i
afraid
our
long
separation
and
the
idea
that
events
must
always
divide
us
may
have
made
a
difference
but
she
in
the
town
i
seen
her
at
church
have
you
spoken
to
her
since
you
came
back
yes
at
deane
but
i
could
renew
my
proposals
to
her
on
several
grounds
one
obstacle
would
be
removed
if
you
would
give
your
consent
if
you
would
be
willing
to
think
of
her
as
a
wakem
was
silent
a
little
while
pausing
before
maggie
picture
she
not
the
sort
of
woman
your
mother
was
though
phil
he
said
at
last
i
saw
her
at
church
she
handsomer
than
this
deuced
fine
eyes
and
fine
figure
i
saw
but
rather
dangerous
and
unmanageable
eh
she
very
tender
and
affectionate
and
so
simple
without
the
airs
and
petty
contrivances
other
women
have
ah
said
wakem
then
looking
round
at
his
son
but
your
mother
looked
gentler
she
had
that
brown
wavy
hair
and
gray
eyes
like
yours
you
ca
remember
her
very
well
it
was
a
thousand
pities
no
likeness
of
her
then
should
you
be
glad
for
me
to
have
the
same
sort
of
happiness
father
to
sweeten
my
life
for
me
there
can
never
be
another
tie
so
strong
to
you
as
that
which
began
years
ago
when
you
married
my
mother
and
you
have
been
tightening
it
ever
since
ah
phil
you
the
only
fellow
that
knows
the
best
of
me
said
wakem
giving
his
hand
to
his
son
we
must
keep
together
if
we
can
and
now
what
am
i
to
do
you
must
come
downstairs
and
tell
me
am
i
to
go
and
call
on
this
damsel
the
barrier
once
thrown
down
in
this
way
philip
could
talk
freely
to
his
father
of
their
entire
relation
with
the
tullivers
of
the
desire
to
get
the
mill
and
land
back
into
the
family
and
of
its
transfer
to
guest
as
an
intermediate
step
he
could
venture
now
to
be
persuasive
and
urgent
and
his
father
yielded
with
more
readiness
than
he
had
calculated
on
do
care
about
the
mill
he
said
at
last
with
a
sort
of
angry
compliance
i
had
an
infernal
deal
of
bother
lately
about
the
mill
let
them
pay
me
for
my
improvements
that
all
but
there
one
thing
you
need
ask
me
i
shall
have
no
direct
transactions
with
young
tulliver
if
you
like
to
swallow
him
for
his
sister
sake
you
may
but
i
no
sauce
that
will
make
him
go
down
i
leave
you
to
imagine
the
agreeable
feelings
with
which
philip
went
to
deane
the
next
day
to
say
that
wakem
was
ready
to
open
the
negotiations
and
lucy
pretty
triumph
as
she
appealed
to
her
father
whether
she
had
not
proved
her
great
business
abilities
deane
was
rather
puzzled
and
suspected
that
there
had
been
something
going
on
among
the
young
people
to
which
he
wanted
a
clew
but
to
men
of
deane
stamp
what
goes
on
among
the
young
people
is
as
extraneous
to
the
real
business
of
life
as
what
goes
on
among
the
birds
and
butterflies
until
it
can
be
shown
to
have
a
malign
bearing
on
monetary
affairs
and
in
this
case
the
bearing
appeared
to
be
entirely
propitious
chapter
ix
charity
in
the
culmination
of
maggie
career
as
an
admired
member
of
society
in
ogg
was
certainly
the
day
of
the
bazaar
when
her
simple
noble
beauty
clad
in
a
white
muslin
of
some
kind
which
i
suspect
must
have
come
from
the
stores
of
aunt
pullet
wardrobe
appeared
with
marked
distinction
among
the
more
adorned
and
conventional
women
around
her
we
perhaps
never
detect
how
much
of
our
social
demeanor
is
made
up
of
artificial
airs
until
we
see
a
person
who
is
at
once
beautiful
and
simple
without
the
beauty
we
are
apt
to
call
simplicity
awkwardness
the
miss
guests
were
much
too
to
have
any
of
the
grimaces
and
affected
tones
that
belong
to
pretentious
vulgarity
but
their
stall
being
next
to
the
one
where
maggie
sat
it
seemed
newly
obvious
that
miss
guest
held
her
chin
too
high
and
that
miss
laura
spoke
and
moved
continually
with
a
view
to
effect
all
ogg
and
its
neighborhood
were
there
and
it
would
have
been
worth
while
to
come
even
from
a
distance
to
see
the
fine
old
hall
with
its
open
roof
and
carved
oaken
rafters
and
great
oaken
and
light
shed
down
from
a
height
on
the
show
beneath
a
very
quaint
place
with
broad
faded
stripes
painted
on
the
walls
and
here
and
there
a
show
of
heraldic
animals
of
a
bristly
character
the
cherished
emblems
of
a
noble
family
once
the
seigniors
of
this
now
civic
hall
a
grand
arch
cut
in
the
upper
wall
at
one
end
surmounted
an
oaken
orchestra
with
an
open
room
behind
it
where
hothouse
plants
and
stalls
for
refreshments
were
disposed
an
agreeable
resort
for
gentlemen
disposed
to
loiter
and
yet
to
exchange
the
occasional
crush
down
below
for
a
more
commodious
point
of
view
in
fact
the
perfect
fitness
of
this
ancient
building
for
an
admirable
modern
purpose
that
made
charity
truly
elegant
and
led
through
vanity
up
to
the
supply
of
a
deficit
was
so
striking
that
hardly
a
person
entered
the
room
without
exchanging
the
remark
more
than
once
near
the
great
arch
over
the
orchestra
was
the
stone
oriel
with
painted
glass
which
was
one
of
the
venerable
inconsistencies
of
the
old
hall
and
it
was
close
by
this
that
lucy
had
her
stall
for
the
convenience
of
certain
large
plain
articles
which
she
had
taken
charge
of
for
kenn
maggie
had
begged
to
sit
at
the
open
end
of
the
stall
and
to
have
the
sale
of
these
articles
rather
than
of
and
other
elaborate
products
of
which
she
had
but
a
dim
understanding
but
it
soon
appeared
that
the
gentlemen
which
were
among
her
commodities
were
objects
of
such
general
attention
and
inquiry
and
excited
so
troublesome
a
curiosity
as
to
their
lining
and
comparative
merits
together
with
a
determination
to
test
them
by
trying
on
as
to
make
her
post
a
very
conspicuous
one
the
ladies
who
had
commodities
of
their
own
to
sell
and
did
not
want
saw
at
once
the
frivolity
and
bad
taste
of
this
masculine
preference
for
goods
which
any
tailor
could
furnish
and
it
is
possible
that
the
emphatic
notice
of
various
kinds
which
was
drawn
toward
miss
tulliver
on
this
public
occasion
threw
a
very
strong
and
unmistakable
light
on
her
subsequent
conduct
in
many
minds
then
present
not
that
anger
on
account
of
spurned
beauty
can
dwell
in
the
celestial
breasts
of
charitable
ladies
but
rather
that
the
errors
of
persons
who
have
once
been
much
admired
necessarily
take
a
deeper
tinge
from
the
mere
force
of
contrast
and
also
that
maggie
conspicuous
position
for
the
first
time
made
evident
certain
characteristics
which
were
subsequently
felt
to
have
an
explanatory
bearing
there
was
something
rather
bold
in
miss
tulliver
direct
gaze
and
something
undefinably
coarse
in
the
style
of
her
beauty
which
placed
her
in
the
opinion
of
all
feminine
judges
far
below
her
cousin
miss
deane
for
the
ladies
of
ogg
had
now
completely
ceded
to
lucy
their
hypothetic
claims
on
the
admiration
of
stephen
guest
as
for
dear
little
lucy
herself
her
late
benevolent
triumph
about
the
mill
and
all
the
affectionate
projects
she
was
cherishing
for
maggie
and
philip
helped
to
give
her
the
highest
spirits
and
she
felt
nothing
but
pleasure
in
the
evidence
of
maggie
attractiveness
it
is
true
she
was
looking
very
charming
herself
and
stephen
was
paying
her
the
utmost
attention
on
this
public
occasion
jealously
buying
up
the
articles
he
had
seen
under
her
fingers
in
the
process
of
making
and
gayly
helping
her
to
cajole
the
male
customers
into
the
purchase
of
the
most
effeminate
futilities
he
chose
to
lay
aside
his
hat
and
wear
a
scarlet
fez
of
her
embroidering
but
by
superficial
observers
this
was
necessarily
liable
to
be
interpreted
less
as
a
compliment
to
lucy
than
as
a
mark
of
coxcombry
guest
is
a
great
coxcomb
young
torry
observed
but
then
he
is
a
privileged
person
in
ogg
he
carries
all
before
him
if
another
fellow
did
such
things
everybody
would
say
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
and
stephen
purchased
absolutely
nothing
from
maggie
until
lucy
said
in
rather
a
vexed
undertone
see
now
all
the
things
of
maggie
knitting
will
be
gone
and
you
will
not
have
bought
one
there
are
those
deliciously
soft
warm
things
for
the
wrists
do
buy
them
oh
no
said
stephen
they
must
be
intended
for
imaginative
persons
who
can
chill
themselves
on
this
warm
day
by
thinking
of
the
frosty
caucasus
stern
reason
is
my
forte
you
know
you
must
get
philip
to
buy
those
by
the
way
why
does
he
come
he
never
likes
going
where
there
are
many
people
though
i
enjoined
him
to
come
he
said
he
would
buy
up
any
of
my
goods
that
the
rest
of
the
world
rejected
but
now
do
go
and
buy
something
of
maggie
no
no
see
she
has
got
a
customer
there
is
old
wakem
himself
just
coming
up
lucy
eyes
turned
with
anxious
interest
toward
maggie
to
see
how
she
went
through
this
first
interview
since
a
sadly
memorable
time
with
a
man
toward
whom
she
must
have
so
strange
a
mixture
of
feelings
but
she
was
pleased
to
notice
that
wakem
had
tact
enough
to
enter
at
once
into
talk
about
the
bazaar
wares
and
appear
interested
in
purchasing
smiling
now
and
then
kindly
at
maggie
and
not
calling
on
her
to
speak
much
as
if
he
observed
that
she
was
rather
pale
and
tremulous
why
wakem
is
making
himself
particularly
amiable
to
your
cousin
said
stephen
in
an
undertone
to
lucy
is
it
pure
magnanimity
you
talked
of
a
family
quarrel
oh
that
will
soon
be
quite
healed
i
hope
said
lucy
becoming
a
little
indiscreet
in
her
satisfaction
and
speaking
with
an
air
of
significance
but
stephen
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
and
as
some
came
up
he
lounged
on
toward
maggie
end
handling
trifles
and
standing
aloof
until
wakem
who
had
taken
out
his
purse
had
finished
his
transactions
my
son
came
with
me
he
overheard
wakem
saying
but
he
has
vanished
into
some
other
part
of
the
building
and
has
left
all
these
charitable
gallantries
to
me
i
hope
you
reproach
him
for
his
shabby
conduct
she
returned
his
smile
and
bow
without
speaking
and
he
turned
away
only
then
observing
stephen
and
nodding
to
him
maggie
conscious
that
stephen
was
still
there
busied
herself
with
counting
money
and
avoided
looking
up
she
had
been
well
pleased
that
he
had
devoted
himself
to
lucy
and
had
not
come
near
her
they
had
begun
the
morning
with
an
indifferent
salutation
and
both
had
rejoiced
in
being
aloof
from
each
other
like
a
patient
who
has
actually
done
without
his
opium
in
spite
of
former
failures
in
resolution
and
during
the
last
few
days
they
had
even
been
making
up
their
minds
to
failures
looking
to
the
outward
events
that
must
soon
come
to
separate
them
as
a
reason
for
dispensing
with
in
detail
stephen
moved
step
by
step
as
if
he
were
being
unwillingly
dragged
until
he
had
got
round
the
open
end
of
the
stall
and
was
half
hidden
by
a
screen
of
draperies
maggie
went
on
counting
her
money
till
she
suddenly
heard
a
deep
gentle
voice
saying
are
you
very
tried
do
let
me
bring
you
something
some
fruit
or
jelly
may
i
the
unexpected
tones
shook
her
like
a
sudden
accidental
vibration
of
a
harp
close
by
her
oh
no
thank
you
she
said
faintly
and
only
half
looking
up
for
an
instant
you
look
so
pale
stephen
insisted
in
a
more
entreating
tone
sure
you
exhausted
i
must
disobey
you
and
bring
something
no
indeed
i
could
take
it
are
you
angry
with
me
what
have
i
done
look
at
me
pray
go
away
said
maggie
looking
at
him
helplessly
her
eyes
glancing
immediately
from
him
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
orchestra
which
was
half
hidden
by
the
folds
of
the
old
faded
green
curtain
maggie
had
no
sooner
uttered
this
entreaty
than
she
was
wretched
at
the
admission
it
implied
but
stephen
turned
away
at
once
and
following
her
upward
glance
he
saw
philip
wakem
sealed
in
the
corner
so
that
he
could
command
little
more
than
that
angle
of
the
hall
in
which
maggie
sat
an
entirely
new
thought
occurred
to
stephen
and
linking
itself
with
what
he
had
observed
of
manner
and
with
lucy
reply
to
his
observation
it
convinced
him
that
there
had
been
some
former
relation
between
philip
and
maggie
beyond
that
childish
one
of
which
he
had
heard
more
than
one
impulse
made
him
immediately
leave
the
hall
and
go
upstairs
to
the
where
walking
up
to
philip
he
sat
down
behind
him
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
are
you
studying
for
a
portrait
phil
he
said
or
for
a
sketch
of
that
oriel
window
by
george
it
makes
a
capital
bit
from
this
dark
corner
with
the
curtain
just
marking
it
off
i
have
been
studying
expression
said
philip
curtly
what
miss
tulliver
it
rather
of
the
order
i
think
something
of
the
fallen
princess
serving
behind
a
counter
her
cousin
sent
me
to
her
with
a
civil
offer
to
get
her
some
refreshment
but
i
have
been
snubbed
as
usual
there
natural
antipathy
between
us
i
suppose
i
have
seldom
the
honor
to
please
her
what
a
hypocrite
you
are
said
philip
flushing
angrily
what
because
experience
must
have
told
me
that
i
universally
pleasing
i
admit
the
law
but
there
some
disturbing
force
here
i
am
going
said
philip
rising
abruptly
so
am
i
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
this
place
gets
oppressive
i
think
i
have
done
suit
and
service
long
enough
the
two
friends
walked
downstairs
together
without
speaking
philip
turned
through
the
outer
door
into
the
but
stephen
saying
oh
by
the
by
i
must
call
in
here
went
on
along
the
passage
to
one
of
the
rooms
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
which
were
appropriated
to
the
town
library
he
had
the
room
all
to
himself
and
a
man
requires
nothing
less
than
this
when
he
wants
to
dash
his
cap
on
the
table
throw
himself
astride
a
chair
and
stare
at
a
high
brick
wall
with
a
frown
which
would
not
have
been
beneath
the
occasion
if
he
had
been
slaying
the
giant
python
the
conduct
that
issues
from
a
moral
conflict
has
often
so
close
a
resemblance
to
vice
that
the
distinction
escapes
all
outward
judgments
founded
on
a
mere
comparison
of
actions
it
is
clear
to
you
i
hope
that
stephen
was
not
a
hypocrite
capable
of
deliberate
doubleness
for
a
selfish
end
and
yet
his
fluctuations
between
the
indulgence
of
a
feeling
and
the
systematic
concealment
of
it
might
have
made
a
good
case
in
support
of
philip
accusation
meanwhile
maggie
sat
at
her
stall
cold
and
trembling
with
that
painful
sensation
in
the
eyes
which
comes
from
resolutely
repressed
tears
was
her
life
to
be
always
like
this
always
bringing
some
new
source
of
inward
strife
she
heard
confusedly
the
busy
indifferent
voices
around
her
and
wished
her
mind
could
flow
into
that
easy
babbling
current
it
was
at
this
moment
that
kenn
who
had
quite
lately
come
into
the
hall
and
was
now
walking
down
the
middle
with
his
hands
behind
him
taking
a
general
view
fixed
his
eyes
on
maggie
for
the
first
time
and
was
struck
with
the
expression
of
pain
on
her
beautiful
face
she
was
sitting
quite
still
for
the
stream
of
customers
had
lessened
at
this
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
the
gentlemen
had
chiefly
chosen
the
middle
of
the
day
and
maggie
stall
was
looking
rather
bare
this
with
her
absent
pained
expression
finished
the
contrast
between
her
and
her
companions
who
were
all
bright
eager
and
busy
he
was
strongly
arrested
her
face
had
naturally
drawn
his
attention
as
a
new
and
striking
one
at
church
and
he
had
been
introduced
to
her
during
a
short
call
on
business
at
deane
but
he
had
never
spoken
more
than
three
words
to
her
he
walked
toward
her
now
and
maggie
perceiving
some
one
approaching
roused
herself
to
look
up
and
be
prepared
to
speak
she
felt
a
childlike
instinctive
relief
from
the
sense
of
uneasiness
in
this
exertion
when
she
saw
it
was
kenn
face
that
was
looking
at
her
that
plain
face
with
a
grave
penetrating
kindness
in
it
seeming
to
tell
of
a
human
being
who
had
reached
a
firm
safe
strand
but
was
looking
with
helpful
pity
toward
the
strugglers
still
tossed
by
the
waves
had
an
effect
on
maggie
at
this
moment
which
was
afterward
remembered
by
her
as
if
it
had
been
a
promise
the
who
have
lived
through
their
strongest
emotions
but
are
yet
in
the
time
when
memory
is
still
half
passionate
and
not
merely
contemplative
should
surely
be
a
sort
of
natural
priesthood
whom
life
has
disciplined
and
consecrated
to
be
the
refuge
and
rescue
of
early
stumblers
and
victims
of
most
of
us
at
some
moment
in
our
young
lives
would
have
welcomed
a
priest
of
that
natural
order
in
any
sort
of
canonicals
or
uncanonicals
but
had
to
scramble
upward
into
all
the
difficulties
of
nineteen
entirely
without
such
aid
as
maggie
did
you
find
your
office
rather
a
fatiguing
one
i
fear
miss
tulliver
said
kenn
it
is
rather
said
maggie
simply
not
being
accustomed
to
simpler
amiable
denials
of
obvious
facts
but
i
can
tell
kenn
that
you
have
disposed
of
her
goods
very
quickly
he
added
she
will
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
oh
i
have
done
nothing
the
gentlemen
came
very
fast
to
buy
the
and
embroidered
waistcoats
but
i
think
any
of
the
other
ladies
would
have
sold
more
i
did
know
what
to
say
about
them
kenn
smiled
i
hope
i
going
to
have
you
as
a
permanent
parishioner
now
miss
tulliver
am
i
you
have
been
at
a
distance
from
us
hitherto
i
have
been
a
teacher
in
a
school
and
i
going
into
another
situation
of
the
same
kind
very
soon
ah
i
was
hoping
you
would
remain
among
your
friends
who
are
all
in
this
neighborhood
i
believe
oh
must
said
maggie
earnestly
looking
at
kenn
with
an
expression
of
reliance
as
if
she
had
told
him
her
history
in
those
three
words
it
was
one
of
those
moments
of
implicit
revelation
which
will
sometimes
happen
even
between
people
who
meet
quite
transiently
on
a
mile
journey
perhaps
or
when
resting
by
the
wayside
there
is
always
this
possibility
of
a
word
or
look
from
a
stranger
to
keep
alive
the
sense
of
human
brotherhood
kenn
ear
and
eye
took
in
all
the
signs
that
this
brief
confidence
of
maggie
was
charged
with
meaning
i
understand
he
said
you
feel
it
right
to
go
but
that
will
not
prevent
our
meeting
again
i
hope
it
will
not
prevent
my
knowing
you
better
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
he
put
out
his
hand
and
pressed
hers
kindly
before
he
turned
away
she
has
some
trouble
or
other
at
heart
he
thought
poor
child
she
looks
as
if
she
might
turn
out
to
be
one
of
souls
by
nature
pitched
too
high
by
suffering
plunged
too
low
there
something
wonderfully
honest
in
those
beautiful
eyes
it
may
be
surprising
that
maggie
among
whose
many
imperfections
an
excessive
delight
in
admiration
and
acknowledged
supremacy
were
not
absent
now
any
more
than
when
she
was
instructing
the
gypsies
with
a
view
toward
achieving
a
royal
position
among
them
was
not
more
elated
on
a
day
when
she
had
had
the
tribute
of
so
many
looks
and
smiles
together
with
that
satisfactory
consciousness
which
had
necessarily
come
from
being
taken
before
lucy
chevalglass
and
made
to
look
at
the
full
length
of
her
tall
beauty
crowned
by
the
night
of
her
massy
hair
maggie
had
smiled
at
herself
then
and
for
the
moment
had
forgotten
everything
in
the
sense
of
her
own
beauty
if
that
state
of
mind
could
have
lasted
her
choice
would
have
been
to
have
stephen
guest
at
her
feet
offering
her
a
life
filled
with
all
luxuries
with
daily
incense
of
adoration
near
and
distant
and
with
all
possibilities
of
culture
at
her
command
but
there
were
things
in
her
stronger
than
vanity
passion
and
affection
and
long
deep
memories
of
early
discipline
and
effort
of
early
claims
on
her
love
and
pity
and
the
stream
of
vanity
was
soon
swept
along
and
mingled
imperceptibly
with
that
wider
current
which
was
at
its
highest
force
today
under
the
double
urgency
of
the
events
and
inward
impulses
brought
by
the
last
week
philip
had
not
spoken
to
her
himself
about
the
removal
of
obstacles
between
them
on
his
father
side
he
shrank
from
that
but
he
had
told
everything
to
lucy
with
the
hope
that
maggie
being
informed
through
her
might
give
him
some
encouraging
sign
that
their
being
brought
thus
much
nearer
to
each
other
was
a
happiness
to
her
the
rush
of
conflicting
feelings
was
too
great
for
maggie
to
say
much
when
lucy
with
a
face
breathing
playful
joy
like
one
of
cherubs
poured
forth
her
triumphant
revelation
and
lucy
could
hardly
be
surprised
that
she
could
do
little
more
than
cry
with
gladness
at
the
thought
of
her
father
wish
being
fulfilled
and
of
tom
getting
the
mill
again
in
reward
for
all
his
hard
striving
the
details
of
preparation
for
the
bazaar
had
then
come
to
usurp
lucy
attention
for
the
next
few
days
and
nothing
had
been
said
by
the
cousins
on
subjects
that
were
likely
to
rouse
deeper
feelings
philip
had
been
to
the
house
more
than
once
but
maggie
had
had
no
private
conversation
with
him
and
thus
she
had
been
left
to
fight
her
inward
battle
without
interference
but
when
the
bazaar
was
fairly
ended
and
the
cousins
were
alone
again
resting
together
at
home
lucy
said
you
must
give
up
going
to
stay
with
your
aunt
moss
the
day
after
maggie
write
a
note
to
her
and
tell
her
you
have
put
it
off
at
my
request
and
i
send
the
man
with
it
she
wo
be
displeased
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
go
and
i
want
you
to
go
out
of
the
way
just
now
yes
indeed
i
must
go
dear
i
ca
put
it
off
i
would
leave
aunt
gritty
out
for
the
world
and
i
shall
have
very
little
time
for
i
going
away
to
a
new
situation
on
the
of
june
maggie
said
lucy
almost
white
with
astonishment
i
did
tell
you
dear
said
maggie
making
a
great
effort
to
command
herself
because
you
been
so
busy
but
some
time
ago
i
wrote
to
our
old
governess
miss
firniss
to
ask
her
to
let
me
know
if
she
met
with
any
situation
that
i
could
fill
and
the
other
day
i
had
a
letter
from
her
telling
me
that
i
could
take
three
orphan
pupils
of
hers
to
the
coast
during
the
holidays
and
then
make
trial
of
a
situation
with
her
as
teacher
i
wrote
yesterday
to
accept
the
offer
lucy
felt
so
hurt
that
for
some
moments
she
was
unable
to
speak
maggie
she
said
at
last
how
could
you
be
so
unkind
to
me
not
to
tell
me
to
take
a
step
and
now
she
hesitated
a
little
and
then
added
and
philip
i
thought
everything
was
going
to
be
so
happy
oh
maggie
what
is
the
reason
give
it
up
let
me
write
there
is
nothing
now
to
keep
you
and
philip
apart
yes
said
maggie
faintly
there
is
tom
feeling
he
said
i
must
give
him
up
if
i
married
philip
and
i
know
he
will
not
change
at
least
not
for
a
long
while
unless
something
happened
to
soften
him
but
i
will
talk
to
him
he
coming
back
this
week
and
this
good
news
about
the
mill
will
soften
him
and
i
talk
to
him
about
philip
tom
always
very
compliant
to
me
i
do
think
he
so
obstinate
but
i
must
go
said
maggie
in
a
distressed
voice
i
must
leave
some
time
to
pack
do
press
me
to
stay
dear
lucy
lucy
was
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
looking
away
and
ruminating
at
length
she
knelt
down
by
her
cousin
and
looking
up
in
her
face
with
anxious
seriousness
said
maggie
is
it
that
you
do
love
philip
well
enough
to
marry
him
tell
me
trust
me
maggie
held
lucy
hands
tightly
in
silence
a
little
while
her
own
hands
were
quite
cold
but
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
quite
clear
and
distinct
yes
lucy
i
would
choose
to
marry
him
i
think
it
would
be
the
best
and
highest
lot
for
me
to
make
his
life
happy
he
loved
me
first
no
one
else
could
be
quite
what
he
is
to
me
but
i
ca
divide
myself
from
my
brother
for
life
i
must
go
away
and
wait
pray
do
speak
to
me
again
about
it
lucy
obeyed
in
pain
and
wonder
the
next
word
she
said
was
well
dear
maggie
at
least
you
will
go
to
the
dance
at
park
house
and
have
some
music
and
brightness
before
you
go
to
pay
these
dull
dutiful
visits
ah
here
come
aunty
and
the
tea
chapter
x
the
spell
seems
broken
the
suite
of
rooms
opening
into
each
other
at
park
house
looked
duly
brilliant
with
lights
and
flowers
and
the
personal
splendors
of
sixteen
couples
with
attendant
parents
and
guardians
the
focus
of
brilliancy
was
the
long
where
the
dancing
went
forward
under
the
inspiration
of
the
grand
piano
the
library
into
which
it
opened
at
one
end
had
the
more
sober
illumination
of
maturity
with
caps
and
cards
and
at
the
other
end
the
pretty
with
a
conservatory
attached
was
left
as
an
occasional
cool
retreat
lucy
who
had
laid
aside
her
black
for
the
first
time
and
had
her
pretty
slimness
set
off
by
an
abundant
dress
of
white
crape
was
the
acknowledged
queen
of
the
occasion
for
this
was
one
of
the
miss
guests
thoroughly
condescending
parties
including
no
member
of
any
aristocracy
higher
than
that
of
ogg
and
stretching
to
the
extreme
limits
of
commercial
and
professional
gentility
maggie
at
first
refused
to
dance
saying
that
she
had
forgotten
all
the
figures
it
was
so
many
years
since
she
had
danced
at
school
and
she
was
glad
to
have
that
excuse
for
it
is
ill
dancing
with
a
heavy
heart
but
at
length
the
music
wrought
in
her
young
limbs
and
the
longing
came
even
though
it
was
the
horrible
young
torry
who
walked
up
a
second
time
to
try
and
persuade
her
she
warned
him
that
she
could
not
dance
anything
but
a
but
he
of
course
was
willing
to
wait
for
that
high
felicity
meaning
only
to
be
complimentary
when
he
assured
her
at
several
intervals
that
it
was
a
great
bore
that
she
could
waltz
he
would
have
liked
so
much
to
waltz
with
her
but
at
last
it
was
the
turn
of
the
good
dance
which
has
the
least
of
vanity
and
the
most
of
merriment
in
it
and
maggie
quite
forgot
her
troublous
life
in
a
childlike
enjoyment
of
that
rhythm
which
seems
to
banish
pretentious
etiquette
she
felt
quite
charitably
toward
young
torry
as
his
hand
bore
her
along
and
held
her
up
in
the
dance
her
eyes
and
cheeks
had
that
fire
of
young
joy
in
them
which
will
flame
out
if
it
can
find
the
least
breath
to
fan
it
and
her
simple
black
dress
with
its
bit
of
black
lace
seemed
like
the
dim
setting
of
a
jewel
stephen
had
not
yet
asked
her
to
dance
had
not
yet
paid
her
more
than
a
passing
civility
since
yesterday
that
inward
vision
of
her
which
perpetually
made
part
of
his
consciousness
had
been
half
screened
by
the
image
of
philip
wakem
which
came
across
it
like
a
blot
there
was
some
attachment
between
her
and
philip
at
least
there
was
an
attachment
on
his
side
which
made
her
feel
in
some
bondage
here
then
stephen
told
himself
was
another
claim
of
honor
which
called
on
him
to
resist
the
attraction
that
was
continually
threatening
to
overpower
him
he
told
himself
so
and
yet
he
had
once
or
twice
felt
a
certain
savage
resistance
and
at
another
moment
a
shuddering
repugnance
to
this
intrusion
of
philip
image
which
almost
made
it
a
new
incitement
to
rush
toward
maggie
and
claim
her
for
himself
nevertheless
he
had
done
what
he
meant
to
do
this
evening
he
had
kept
aloof
from
her
he
had
hardly
looked
at
her
and
he
had
been
gayly
assiduous
to
lucy
but
now
his
eyes
were
devouring
maggie
he
felt
inclined
to
kick
young
torry
out
of
the
dance
and
take
his
place
then
he
wanted
the
dance
to
end
that
he
might
get
rid
of
his
partner
the
possibility
that
he
too
should
dance
with
maggie
and
have
her
hand
in
his
so
long
was
beginning
to
possess
him
like
a
thirst
but
even
now
their
hands
were
meeting
in
the
dance
were
meeting
still
to
the
very
end
of
it
though
they
were
far
off
each
other
stephen
hardly
knew
what
happened
or
in
what
automatic
way
he
got
through
the
duties
of
politeness
in
the
interval
until
he
was
free
and
saw
maggie
seated
alone
again
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
he
made
his
way
toward
her
round
the
couples
that
were
forming
for
the
waltz
and
when
maggie
became
conscious
that
she
was
the
person
he
sought
she
felt
in
spite
of
all
the
thoughts
that
had
gone
before
a
glowing
gladness
at
heart
her
eyes
and
cheeks
were
still
brightened
with
her
childlike
enthusiasm
in
the
dance
her
whole
frame
was
set
to
joy
and
tenderness
even
the
coming
pain
could
not
seem
bitter
she
was
ready
to
welcome
it
as
a
part
of
life
for
life
at
this
moment
seemed
a
keen
vibrating
consciousness
poised
above
pleasure
or
pain
this
one
this
last
night
she
might
expand
unrestrainedly
in
the
warmth
of
the
present
without
those
chill
eating
thoughts
of
the
past
and
the
future
they
going
to
waltz
again
said
stephen
bending
to
speak
to
her
with
that
glance
and
tone
of
subdued
tenderness
which
young
dreams
create
to
themselves
in
the
summer
woods
when
low
cooing
voices
fill
the
air
such
glances
and
tones
bring
the
breath
of
poetry
with
them
into
a
room
that
is
half
stifling
with
glaring
gas
and
hard
flirtation
they
are
going
to
waltz
again
it
is
rather
dizzy
work
to
look
on
and
the
room
is
very
warm
shall
we
walk
about
a
little
he
took
her
hand
and
placed
it
within
his
arm
and
they
walked
on
into
the
where
the
tables
were
strewn
with
engravings
for
the
accommodation
of
visitors
who
would
not
want
to
look
at
them
but
no
visitors
were
here
at
this
moment
they
passed
on
into
the
conservatory
how
strange
and
unreal
the
trees
and
flowers
look
with
the
lights
among
them
said
maggie
in
a
low
voice
they
look
as
if
they
belonged
to
an
enchanted
land
and
would
never
fade
away
i
could
fancy
they
were
all
made
of
jewels
she
was
looking
at
the
tier
of
geraniums
as
she
spoke
and
stephen
made
no
answer
but
he
was
looking
at
her
and
does
not
a
supreme
poet
blend
light
and
sound
into
one
calling
darkness
mute
and
light
eloquent
something
strangely
powerful
there
was
in
the
light
of
stephen
long
gaze
for
it
made
maggie
face
turn
toward
it
and
look
upward
at
it
slowly
like
a
flower
at
the
ascending
brightness
and
they
walked
unsteadily
on
without
feeling
that
they
were
walking
without
feeling
anything
but
that
long
grave
mutual
gaze
which
has
the
solemnity
belonging
to
all
deep
human
passion
the
hovering
thought
that
they
must
and
would
renounce
each
other
made
this
moment
of
mute
confession
more
intense
in
its
rapture
but
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
conservatory
and
were
obliged
to
pause
and
turn
the
change
of
movement
brought
a
new
consciousness
to
maggie
she
blushed
deeply
turned
away
her
head
and
drew
her
arm
from
stephen
going
up
to
some
flowers
to
smell
them
stephen
stood
motionless
and
still
pale
oh
may
i
get
this
rose
said
maggie
making
a
great
effort
to
say
something
and
dissipate
the
burning
sense
of
irretrievable
confession
i
think
i
am
quite
wicked
with
roses
i
like
to
gather
them
and
smell
them
till
they
have
no
scent
left
stephen
was
mute
he
was
incapable
of
putting
a
sentence
together
and
maggie
bent
her
arm
a
little
upward
toward
the
large
rose
that
had
attracted
her
who
has
not
felt
the
beauty
of
a
woman
arm
the
unspeakable
suggestions
of
tenderness
that
lie
in
the
dimpled
elbow
and
all
the
varied
gently
lessening
curves
down
to
the
delicate
wrist
with
its
tiniest
almost
imperceptible
nicks
in
the
firm
softness
a
woman
arm
touched
the
soul
of
a
great
sculptor
two
thousand
years
ago
so
that
he
wrought
an
image
of
it
for
the
parthenon
which
moves
us
still
as
it
clasps
lovingly
the
timeworn
marble
of
a
headless
trunk
maggie
was
such
an
arm
as
that
and
it
had
the
warm
tints
of
life
a
mad
impulse
seized
on
stephen
he
darted
toward
the
arm
and
showered
kisses
on
it
clasping
the
wrist
but
the
next
moment
maggie
snatched
it
from
him
and
glared
at
him
like
a
wounded
quivering
with
rage
and
humiliation
how
dare
you
she
spoke
in
a
deeply
shaken
voice
what
right
have
i
given
you
to
insult
me
she
darted
from
him
into
the
adjoining
room
and
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
panting
and
trembling
a
horrible
punishment
was
come
upon
her
for
the
sin
of
allowing
a
moment
happiness
that
was
treachery
to
lucy
to
philip
to
her
own
better
soul
that
momentary
happiness
had
been
smitten
with
a
blight
a
leprosy
stephen
thought
more
lightly
of
than
he
did
of
lucy
as
for
stephen
he
leaned
back
against
the
framework
of
the
conservatory
dizzy
with
the
conflict
of
passions
love
rage
and
confused
despair
despair
at
his
want
of
and
despair
that
he
had
offended
maggie
the
last
feeling
surmounted
every
other
to
be
by
her
side
again
and
entreat
forgiveness
was
the
only
thing
that
had
the
force
of
a
motive
for
him
and
she
had
not
been
seated
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
he
came
and
stood
humbly
before
her
but
maggie
bitter
rage
was
unspent
leave
me
to
myself
if
you
please
she
said
with
impetuous
haughtiness
and
for
the
future
avoid
me
stephen
turned
away
and
walked
backward
and
forward
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
there
was
the
dire
necessity
of
going
back
into
the
again
and
he
was
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
that
they
had
been
absent
so
short
a
time
that
when
he
went
in
again
the
waltz
was
not
ended
maggie
too
was
not
long
before
she
all
the
pride
of
her
nature
was
stung
into
activity
the
hateful
weakness
which
had
dragged
her
within
reach
of
this
wound
to
her
had
at
least
wrought
its
own
cure
the
thoughts
and
temptations
of
the
last
month
should
all
be
flung
away
into
an
unvisited
chamber
of
memory
there
was
nothing
to
allure
her
now
duty
would
be
easy
and
all
the
old
calm
purposes
would
reign
peacefully
once
more
she
the
still
with
some
excited
brightness
in
her
face
but
with
a
sense
of
proud
that
defied
anything
to
agitate
her
she
refused
to
dance
again
but
she
talked
quite
readily
and
calmly
with
every
one
who
addressed
her
and
when
they
got
home
that
night
she
kissed
lucy
with
a
free
heart
almost
exulting
in
this
scorching
moment
which
had
delivered
her
from
the
possibility
of
another
word
or
look
that
would
have
the
stamp
of
treachery
toward
that
gentle
unsuspicious
sister
the
next
morning
maggie
did
not
set
off
to
basset
quite
so
soon
as
she
had
expected
her
mother
was
to
accompany
her
in
the
carriage
and
household
business
could
not
be
dispatched
hastily
by
tulliver
so
maggie
who
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
prepare
herself
had
to
sit
waiting
equipped
for
the
drive
in
the
garden
lucy
was
busy
in
the
house
wrapping
up
some
bazaar
presents
for
the
younger
ones
at
basset
and
when
there
was
a
loud
ring
at
the
maggie
felt
some
alarm
lest
lucy
should
bring
out
stephen
to
her
it
was
sure
to
be
stephen
but
presently
the
visitor
came
out
into
the
garden
alone
and
seated
himself
by
her
on
the
it
was
not
stephen
we
can
just
catch
the
tips
of
the
scotch
firs
maggie
from
this
seat
said
philip
they
had
taken
each
other
hands
in
silence
but
maggie
had
looked
at
him
with
a
more
complete
revival
of
the
old
childlike
affectionate
smile
than
he
had
seen
before
and
he
felt
encouraged
yes
she
said
i
often
look
at
them
and
wish
i
could
see
the
low
sunlight
on
the
stems
again
but
i
have
never
been
that
way
but
once
to
the
churchyard
with
my
mother
i
have
been
there
i
go
there
continually
said
philip
i
have
nothing
but
the
past
to
live
upon
a
keen
remembrance
and
keen
pity
impelled
maggie
to
put
her
hand
in
philip
they
had
so
often
walked
hand
in
hand
i
remember
all
the
spots
she
said
just
where
you
told
me
of
particular
things
beautiful
stories
that
i
had
never
heard
of
before
you
will
go
there
again
soon
wo
you
maggie
said
philip
getting
timid
the
mill
will
soon
be
your
brother
home
again
yes
but
i
shall
not
be
there
said
maggie
i
shall
only
hear
of
that
happiness
i
am
going
away
again
lucy
has
not
told
you
perhaps
then
the
future
will
never
join
on
to
the
past
again
maggie
that
book
is
quite
closed
the
gray
eyes
that
had
so
often
looked
up
at
her
with
entreating
worship
looked
up
at
her
now
with
a
last
struggling
ray
of
hope
in
them
and
maggie
met
them
with
her
large
sincere
gaze
that
book
never
will
be
closed
philip
she
said
with
grave
sadness
i
desire
no
future
that
will
break
the
ties
of
the
past
but
the
tie
to
my
brother
is
one
of
the
strongest
i
can
do
nothing
willingly
that
will
divide
me
always
from
him
is
that
the
only
reason
that
would
keep
us
apart
forever
maggie
said
philip
with
a
desperate
determination
to
have
a
definite
answer
the
only
reason
said
maggie
with
calm
decision
and
she
believed
it
at
that
moment
she
felt
as
if
the
enchanted
cup
had
been
dashed
to
the
ground
the
reactionary
excitement
that
gave
her
a
proud
had
not
subsided
and
she
looked
at
the
future
with
a
sense
of
calm
choice
they
sat
hand
in
hand
without
looking
at
each
other
or
speaking
for
a
few
minutes
in
maggie
mind
the
first
scenes
of
love
and
parting
were
more
present
than
the
actual
moment
and
she
was
looking
at
philip
in
the
red
deeps
philip
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
been
thoroughly
happy
in
that
answer
of
hers
she
was
as
open
and
transparent
as
a
why
was
he
not
thoroughly
happy
jealousy
is
never
satisfied
with
anything
short
of
an
omniscience
that
would
detect
the
subtlest
fold
of
the
heart
chapter
xi
in
the
lane
maggie
had
been
four
days
at
her
aunt
moss
giving
the
early
june
sunshine
quite
a
new
brightness
in
the
eyes
of
that
affectionate
woman
and
making
an
epoch
for
her
cousins
great
and
small
who
were
learning
her
words
and
actions
by
heart
as
if
she
had
been
a
transient
avatar
of
perfect
wisdom
and
beauty
she
was
standing
on
the
causeway
with
her
aunt
and
a
group
of
cousins
feeding
the
chickens
at
that
quiet
moment
in
the
life
of
the
farmyards
before
the
afternoon
the
great
buildings
round
the
hollow
yard
were
as
dreary
and
tumbledown
as
ever
but
over
the
old
the
straggling
were
beginning
to
toss
their
summer
weight
and
the
gray
wood
and
old
bricks
of
the
house
on
its
higher
level
had
a
look
of
sleepy
age
in
the
broad
afternoon
sunlight
that
suited
the
quiescent
time
maggie
with
her
bonnet
over
her
arm
was
smiling
down
at
the
hatch
of
small
fluffy
chickens
when
her
aunt
exclaimed
goodness
me
who
is
that
gentleman
coming
in
at
the
gate
it
was
a
gentleman
on
a
tall
bay
horse
and
the
flanks
and
neck
of
the
horse
were
streaked
black
with
fast
riding
maggie
felt
a
beating
at
head
and
heart
horrible
as
the
sudden
leaping
to
life
of
a
savage
enemy
who
had
feigned
death
who
is
it
my
dear
said
moss
seeing
in
maggie
face
the
evidence
that
she
knew
it
is
stephen
guest
said
maggie
rather
faintly
my
cousin
lucy
a
gentleman
who
is
very
intimate
at
my
cousin
stephen
was
already
close
to
them
had
jumped
off
his
horse
and
now
raised
his
hat
as
he
advanced
hold
the
horse
willy
said
moss
to
the
boy
no
thank
you
said
stephen
pulling
at
the
horse
impatiently
tossing
head
i
must
be
going
again
immediately
i
have
a
message
to
deliver
to
you
miss
tulliver
on
private
business
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
to
walk
a
few
yards
with
me
he
had
a
look
such
as
a
man
gets
when
he
has
been
dogged
by
some
care
or
annoyance
that
makes
his
bed
and
his
dinner
of
little
use
to
him
he
spoke
almost
abruptly
as
if
his
errand
were
too
pressing
for
him
to
trouble
himself
about
what
would
be
thought
by
moss
of
his
visit
and
request
good
moss
rather
nervous
in
the
presence
of
this
apparently
haughty
gentleman
was
inwardly
wondering
whether
she
would
be
doing
right
or
wrong
to
invite
him
again
to
leave
his
horse
and
walk
in
when
maggie
feeling
all
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
and
unable
to
say
anything
put
on
her
bonnet
and
turned
to
walk
toward
the
gate
stephen
turned
too
and
walked
by
her
side
leading
his
horse
not
a
word
was
spoken
till
they
were
out
in
the
lane
and
had
walked
four
or
five
yards
when
maggie
who
had
been
looking
straight
before
her
all
the
while
turned
again
to
walk
back
saying
with
haughty
resentment
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
go
any
farther
i
do
know
whether
you
consider
it
gentlemanly
and
delicate
conduct
to
place
me
in
a
position
that
forced
me
to
come
out
with
you
or
whether
you
wished
to
insult
me
still
further
by
thrusting
an
interview
upon
me
in
this
way
of
course
you
are
angry
with
me
for
coming
said
stephen
bitterly
of
course
it
is
of
no
consequence
what
a
man
has
to
suffer
it
is
only
your
woman
dignity
that
you
care
about
maggie
gave
a
slight
start
such
as
might
have
come
from
the
slightest
possible
electric
shock
as
if
it
were
not
enough
that
i
entangled
in
this
way
that
i
mad
with
love
for
you
that
i
resist
the
strongest
passion
a
man
can
feel
because
i
try
to
be
true
to
other
claims
but
you
must
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
coarse
brute
who
would
willingly
offend
you
and
when
if
i
had
my
own
choice
i
should
ask
you
to
take
my
hand
and
my
fortune
and
my
whole
life
and
do
what
you
liked
with
them
i
know
i
forgot
myself
i
took
an
unwarrantable
liberty
i
hate
myself
for
having
done
it
but
i
repented
immediately
i
been
repenting
ever
since
you
ought
not
to
think
it
unpardonable
a
man
who
loves
with
his
whole
soul
as
i
do
you
is
liable
to
be
mastered
by
his
feelings
for
a
moment
but
you
know
you
must
believe
that
the
worst
pain
i
could
have
is
to
have
pained
you
that
i
would
give
the
world
to
recall
the
error
maggie
dared
not
speak
dared
not
turn
her
head
the
strength
that
had
come
from
resentment
was
all
gone
and
her
lips
were
quivering
visibly
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
utter
the
full
forgiveness
that
rose
in
answer
to
that
confession
they
were
come
nearly
in
front
of
the
gate
again
and
she
paused
trembling
you
must
not
say
these
things
i
must
not
hear
them
she
said
looking
down
in
misery
as
stephen
came
in
front
of
her
to
prevent
her
from
going
farther
toward
the
gate
i
very
sorry
for
any
pain
you
have
to
go
through
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
speak
yes
it
of
use
said
stephen
impetuously
it
would
be
of
use
if
you
would
treat
me
with
some
sort
of
pity
and
consideration
instead
of
doing
me
vile
injustice
in
your
mind
i
could
bear
everything
more
quietly
if
i
knew
you
did
hate
me
for
an
insolent
coxcomb
look
at
me
see
what
a
hunted
devil
i
am
i
been
riding
thirty
miles
every
day
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
you
maggie
did
not
dared
not
look
she
had
already
seen
the
harassed
face
but
she
said
gently
i
do
think
any
evil
of
you
then
dearest
look
at
me
said
stephen
in
deepest
tenderest
tones
of
entreaty
do
go
away
from
me
yet
give
me
a
moment
happiness
make
me
feel
you
forgiven
me
yes
i
do
forgive
you
said
maggie
shaken
by
those
tones
and
all
the
more
frightened
at
herself
but
pray
let
me
go
in
again
pray
go
away
a
great
tear
fell
from
under
her
lowered
eyelids
i
ca
go
away
from
you
i
ca
leave
you
said
stephen
with
still
more
passionate
pleading
i
shall
come
back
again
if
you
send
me
away
with
this
coldness
i
ca
answer
for
myself
but
if
you
will
go
with
me
only
a
little
way
i
can
live
on
that
you
see
plainly
enough
that
your
anger
has
only
made
me
ten
times
more
unreasonable
maggie
turned
but
tancred
the
bay
horse
began
to
make
such
spirited
remonstrances
against
this
frequent
change
of
direction
that
stephen
catching
sight
of
willy
moss
peeping
through
the
gate
called
out
here
just
come
and
hold
my
horse
for
five
minutes
oh
no
said
maggie
hurriedly
my
aunt
will
think
it
so
strange
never
mind
stephen
answered
impatiently
they
do
know
the
people
at
ogg
lead
him
up
and
down
just
here
for
five
minutes
he
added
to
willy
who
was
now
close
to
them
and
then
he
turned
to
maggie
side
and
they
walked
on
it
was
clear
that
she
go
on
now
take
my
arm
said
stephen
entreatingly
and
she
took
it
feeling
all
the
while
as
if
she
were
sliding
downward
in
a
nightmare
there
is
no
end
to
this
misery
she
began
struggling
to
repel
the
influence
by
speech
it
is
wicked
base
ever
allowing
a
word
or
look
that
lucy
that
others
might
not
have
seen
think
of
lucy
i
do
think
of
her
bless
her
if
i
did
stephen
had
laid
his
hand
on
maggie
that
rested
on
his
arm
and
they
both
felt
it
difficult
to
speak
and
i
have
other
ties
maggie
went
on
at
last
with
a
desperate
effort
even
if
lucy
did
not
exist
you
are
engaged
to
philip
wakem
said
stephen
hastily
is
it
so
i
consider
myself
engaged
to
him
i
do
mean
to
marry
any
one
else
stephen
was
silent
again
until
they
had
turned
out
of
the
sun
into
a
side
lane
all
grassy
and
sheltered
then
he
burst
out
impetuously
it
is
unnatural
it
is
horrible
maggie
if
you
loved
me
as
i
love
you
we
should
throw
everything
else
to
the
winds
for
the
sake
of
belonging
to
each
other
we
should
break
all
these
mistaken
ties
that
were
made
in
blindness
and
determine
to
marry
each
other
i
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
said
maggie
with
deep
slow
distinctness
all
the
gathered
spiritual
force
of
painful
years
coming
to
her
aid
in
this
extremity
she
drew
her
arm
from
his
as
she
spoke
tell
me
then
that
you
do
care
for
me
he
said
almost
violently
tell
me
that
you
love
some
one
else
better
it
darted
through
maggie
mind
that
here
was
a
mode
of
releasing
herself
from
outward
struggle
to
tell
stephen
that
her
whole
heart
was
philip
but
her
lips
would
not
utter
that
and
she
was
silent
if
you
do
love
me
dearest
said
stephen
gently
taking
her
hand
again
and
laying
it
within
his
arm
it
is
better
it
is
right
that
we
should
marry
each
other
we
ca
help
the
pain
it
will
give
it
is
come
upon
us
without
our
seeking
it
is
natural
it
has
taken
hold
of
me
in
spite
of
every
effort
i
have
made
to
resist
it
god
knows
been
trying
to
be
faithful
to
tacit
engagements
and
i
only
made
things
worse
i
better
have
given
way
at
first
maggie
was
silent
if
it
were
wrong
if
she
were
once
convinced
of
that
and
need
no
longer
beat
and
struggle
against
this
current
soft
and
yet
strong
as
the
summer
stream
say
dearest
said
stephen
leaning
to
look
entreatingly
in
her
face
what
could
we
care
about
in
the
whole
world
beside
if
we
belonged
to
each
other
her
breath
was
on
his
face
his
lips
were
very
near
hers
but
there
was
a
great
dread
dwelling
in
his
love
for
her
her
lips
and
eyelids
quivered
she
opened
her
eyes
full
on
his
for
an
instant
like
a
lovely
wild
animal
timid
and
struggling
under
caresses
and
then
turned
sharp
round
toward
home
again
and
after
all
he
went
on
in
an
impatient
tone
trying
to
defeat
his
own
scruples
as
well
as
hers
i
am
breaking
no
positive
engagement
if
lucy
affections
had
been
withdrawn
from
me
and
given
to
some
one
else
i
should
have
felt
no
right
to
assert
a
claim
on
her
if
you
are
not
absolutely
pledged
to
philip
we
are
neither
of
us
bound
you
do
believe
that
it
is
not
your
real
feeling
said
maggie
earnestly
you
feel
as
i
do
that
the
real
tie
lies
in
the
feelings
and
expectations
we
have
raised
in
other
minds
else
all
pledges
might
be
broken
when
there
was
no
outward
penalty
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
faithfulness
stephen
was
silent
he
could
not
pursue
that
argument
the
opposite
conviction
had
wrought
in
him
too
strongly
through
his
previous
time
of
struggle
but
it
soon
presented
itself
in
a
new
form
the
pledge
be
fulfilled
he
said
with
impetuous
insistence
it
is
unnatural
we
can
only
pretend
to
give
ourselves
to
any
one
else
there
is
wrong
in
that
too
there
may
be
misery
in
it
for
as
well
as
for
us
maggie
you
must
see
that
you
do
see
that
he
was
looking
eagerly
at
her
face
for
the
least
sign
of
compliance
his
large
firm
gentle
grasp
was
on
her
hand
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
then
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
said
looking
up
at
him
with
solemn
sadness
oh
it
is
difficult
life
is
very
difficult
it
seems
right
to
me
sometimes
that
we
should
follow
our
strongest
feeling
but
then
such
feelings
continually
come
across
the
ties
that
all
our
former
life
has
made
for
us
the
ties
that
have
made
others
dependent
on
us
and
would
cut
them
in
two
if
life
were
quite
easy
and
simple
as
it
might
have
been
in
paradise
and
we
could
always
see
that
one
being
first
toward
whom
i
mean
if
life
did
not
make
duties
for
us
before
love
comes
love
would
be
a
sign
that
two
people
ought
to
belong
to
each
other
but
i
see
i
feel
it
is
not
so
now
there
are
things
we
must
renounce
in
life
some
of
us
must
resign
love
many
things
are
difficult
and
dark
to
me
but
i
see
one
thing
quite
clearly
that
i
must
not
can
not
seek
my
own
happiness
by
sacrificing
others
love
is
natural
but
surely
pity
and
faithfulness
and
memory
are
natural
too
and
they
would
live
in
me
still
and
punish
me
if
i
did
not
obey
them
i
should
be
haunted
by
the
suffering
i
had
caused
our
love
would
be
poisoned
do
urge
me
help
me
help
me
i
love
you
maggie
had
become
more
and
more
earnest
as
she
went
on
her
face
had
become
flushed
and
her
eyes
fuller
and
fuller
of
appealing
love
stephen
had
the
fibre
of
nobleness
in
him
that
vibrated
to
her
appeal
but
in
the
same
moment
how
could
it
be
otherwise
that
pleading
beauty
gained
new
power
over
him
dearest
he
said
in
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper
while
his
arm
stole
round
her
i
do
i
bear
anything
you
wish
but
one
kiss
one
the
last
before
we
part
one
kiss
and
then
a
long
look
until
maggie
said
tremulously
let
me
go
let
me
make
haste
back
she
hurried
along
and
not
another
word
was
spoken
stephen
stood
still
and
beckoned
when
they
came
within
sight
of
willy
and
the
horse
and
maggie
went
on
through
the
gate
moss
was
standing
alone
at
the
door
of
the
old
porch
she
had
sent
all
the
cousins
in
with
kind
thoughtfulness
it
might
be
a
joyful
thing
that
maggie
had
a
rich
and
handsome
lover
but
she
would
naturally
feel
embarrassed
at
coming
in
again
and
it
might
be
joyful
in
either
case
moss
waited
anxiously
to
receive
maggie
by
herself
the
speaking
face
told
plainly
enough
that
if
there
was
joy
it
was
of
a
very
agitating
dubious
sort
sit
down
here
a
bit
my
dear
she
drew
maggie
into
the
porch
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
by
her
there
was
no
privacy
in
the
house
oh
aunt
gritty
i
very
wretched
i
wish
i
could
have
died
when
i
was
fifteen
it
seemed
so
easy
to
give
things
up
then
it
is
so
hard
now
the
poor
child
threw
her
arms
round
her
aunt
neck
and
fell
into
long
deep
sobs
chapter
xii
a
family
party
maggie
left
her
good
aunt
gritty
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
went
to
garum
firs
to
pay
her
visit
to
aunt
pullet
according
to
agreement
in
the
mean
time
very
unexpected
things
had
happened
and
there
was
to
be
a
family
party
at
garum
to
discuss
and
celebrate
a
change
in
the
fortunes
of
the
tullivers
which
was
likely
finally
to
carry
away
the
shadow
of
their
demerits
like
the
last
limb
of
an
eclipse
and
cause
their
hitherto
obscured
virtues
to
shine
forth
in
splendor
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
a
new
ministry
just
come
into
office
are
not
the
only
who
enjoy
a
period
of
high
appreciation
and
eulogy
in
many
respectable
families
throughout
this
realm
relatives
becoming
creditable
meet
with
a
similar
cordiality
of
recognition
which
in
its
fine
freedom
from
the
coercion
of
any
antecedents
suggests
the
hopeful
possibility
that
we
may
some
day
without
any
notice
find
ourselves
in
full
millennium
with
cockatrices
who
have
ceased
to
bite
and
wolves
that
no
longer
show
their
teeth
with
any
but
the
blandest
intentions
lucy
came
so
early
as
to
have
the
start
even
of
aunt
glegg
for
she
longed
to
have
some
undisturbed
talk
with
maggie
about
the
wonderful
news
it
seemed
did
it
not
said
lucy
with
her
prettiest
air
of
wisdom
as
if
everything
even
other
people
misfortunes
poor
creatures
were
conspiring
now
to
make
poor
dear
aunt
tulliver
and
cousin
tom
and
naughty
maggie
too
if
she
were
not
obstinately
bent
on
the
contrary
as
happy
as
they
deserved
to
be
after
all
their
troubles
to
think
that
the
very
day
the
after
tom
had
come
back
from
newcastle
that
unfortunate
young
jetsome
whom
wakem
had
placed
at
the
mill
had
been
pitched
off
his
horse
in
a
drunken
fit
and
was
lying
at
ogg
in
a
dangerous
state
so
that
wakem
had
signified
his
wish
that
the
new
purchasers
should
enter
on
the
premises
at
once
it
was
very
dreadful
for
that
unhappy
young
man
but
it
did
seem
as
if
the
misfortune
had
happened
then
rather
than
at
any
other
time
in
order
that
cousin
tom
might
all
the
sooner
have
the
fit
reward
of
his
exemplary
conduct
papa
thought
so
very
highly
of
him
aunt
tulliver
must
certainly
go
to
the
mill
now
and
keep
house
for
tom
that
was
rather
a
loss
to
lucy
in
the
matter
of
household
comfort
but
then
to
think
of
poor
aunty
being
in
her
old
place
again
and
gradually
getting
comforts
about
her
there
on
this
last
point
lucy
had
her
cunning
projects
and
when
she
and
maggie
had
made
their
dangerous
way
down
the
bright
stairs
into
the
handsome
parlor
where
the
very
sunbeams
seemed
cleaner
than
elsewhere
she
directed
her
manœuvres
as
any
other
great
tactician
would
have
done
against
the
weaker
side
of
the
enemy
aunt
pullet
she
said
seating
herself
on
the
sofa
and
caressingly
adjusting
that
lady
floating
i
want
you
to
make
up
your
mind
what
linen
and
things
you
will
give
tom
toward
housekeeping
because
you
are
always
so
generous
you
give
such
nice
things
you
know
and
if
you
set
the
example
aunt
glegg
will
follow
that
she
never
can
my
dear
said
pullet
with
unusual
vigor
for
she
has
got
the
linen
to
follow
suit
wi
mine
i
can
tell
you
she
niver
the
taste
not
if
she
spend
the
money
big
checks
and
live
things
like
stags
and
foxes
all
her
is
not
a
spot
nor
a
diamond
among
but
it
poor
work
dividing
one
linen
before
one
dies
i
niver
thought
to
ha
done
that
bessy
pullet
continued
shaking
her
head
and
looking
at
her
sister
tulliver
when
you
and
me
chose
the
double
diamont
the
first
flax
iver
spun
and
the
lord
knows
where
yours
is
gone
i
no
choice
i
sure
sister
said
poor
tulliver
accustomed
to
consider
herself
in
the
light
of
an
accused
person
i
sure
it
was
no
wish
o
mine
iver
as
i
should
lie
awake
o
nights
thinking
my
best
bleached
linen
all
over
the
country
take
a
peppermint
tulliver
said
uncle
pullet
feeling
that
he
was
offering
a
cheap
and
wholesome
form
of
comfort
which
he
was
recommending
by
example
oh
but
aunt
pullet
said
lucy
you
so
much
beautiful
linen
and
suppose
you
had
had
daughters
then
you
must
have
divided
it
when
they
were
married
well
i
do
say
as
i
wo
do
it
said
pullet
for
now
so
lucky
it
nothing
but
right
his
friends
should
look
on
him
and
help
him
there
the
tablecloths
i
bought
at
your
sale
bessy
it
was
nothing
but
good
natur
o
me
to
buy
for
they
been
lying
in
the
chest
ever
since
but
i
not
going
to
give
maggie
any
more
o
my
indy
muslin
and
things
if
she
to
go
into
service
again
when
she
might
stay
and
keep
me
company
and
do
my
sewing
for
me
if
she
wanted
at
her
brother
going
into
service
was
the
expression
by
which
the
dodson
mind
represented
to
itself
the
position
of
teacher
or
governess
and
maggie
return
to
that
menial
condition
now
circumstances
offered
her
more
eligible
prospects
was
likely
to
be
a
sore
point
with
all
her
relatives
besides
lucy
maggie
in
her
crude
form
with
her
hair
down
her
back
and
altogether
in
a
state
of
dubious
promise
was
a
most
undesirable
niece
but
now
she
was
capable
of
being
at
once
ornamental
and
useful
the
subject
was
revived
in
aunt
and
uncle
glegg
presence
over
the
tea
and
muffins
hegh
hegh
said
glegg
patting
maggie
on
the
back
nonsense
nonsense
do
let
us
hear
of
you
taking
a
place
again
maggie
why
you
must
ha
picked
up
sweethearts
at
the
bazaar
is
there
one
of
the
right
sort
of
article
come
now
glegg
said
his
wife
with
that
shade
of
increased
politeness
in
her
severity
which
she
always
put
on
with
her
crisper
fronts
excuse
me
but
you
far
too
light
for
a
man
of
your
years
respect
and
duty
to
her
aunts
and
the
rest
of
her
kin
as
are
so
good
to
her
should
have
kept
my
niece
from
fixing
about
going
away
again
without
consulting
us
not
sweethearts
if
i
to
use
such
a
word
though
it
was
never
heared
in
family
why
what
did
they
call
us
when
we
went
to
see
then
eh
neighbor
pullet
they
thought
us
sweet
enough
then
said
glegg
winking
pleasantly
while
pullet
at
the
suggestion
of
sweetness
took
a
little
more
sugar
glegg
said
if
you
going
to
be
undelicate
let
me
know
la
jane
your
husband
only
joking
said
pullet
let
him
joke
while
he
got
health
and
strength
there
poor
mr
tilt
got
his
mouth
drawn
all
o
one
side
and
could
laugh
if
he
was
to
try
i
trouble
you
for
the
muffineer
then
glegg
said
if
i
may
be
so
bold
to
interrupt
your
joking
though
it
other
people
must
see
the
joke
in
a
niece
putting
a
slight
on
her
eldest
sister
as
is
the
head
o
the
family
and
only
coming
in
and
out
on
short
visits
all
the
time
she
been
in
the
town
and
then
settling
to
go
away
without
my
knowledge
as
i
laid
caps
out
on
purpose
for
her
to
make
up
for
me
and
me
as
have
divided
my
money
so
equal
sister
tulliver
broke
in
anxiously
i
sure
maggie
never
thought
o
going
away
without
staying
at
your
house
as
well
as
the
others
not
as
it
my
wish
she
should
go
away
at
all
but
quite
contrairy
i
sure
i
innocent
i
said
over
and
over
again
dear
you
no
call
to
go
away
but
there
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
maggie
have
before
she
fixed
to
go
she
can
stay
at
your
house
just
as
well
and
i
step
in
when
i
can
and
so
will
lucy
bessy
said
glegg
if
you
exercise
a
little
more
thought
you
might
know
i
should
hardly
think
it
was
worth
while
to
unpin
a
bed
and
go
to
all
that
trouble
now
just
at
the
end
o
the
time
when
our
house
is
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
from
deane
she
can
come
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
go
back
the
last
at
night
and
be
thankful
she
got
a
good
aunt
so
close
to
her
to
come
and
sit
with
i
know
should
when
i
was
her
age
la
jane
said
pullet
it
do
your
beds
good
to
have
somebody
to
sleep
in
there
that
striped
room
smells
dreadful
mouldy
and
the
glass
mildewed
like
anything
i
sure
i
thought
i
should
be
struck
with
death
when
you
took
me
in
oh
there
is
tom
exclaimed
lucy
clapping
her
hands
he
come
on
sindbad
as
i
told
him
i
was
afraid
he
was
not
going
to
keep
his
promise
maggie
jumped
up
to
kiss
tom
as
he
entered
with
strong
feeling
at
this
first
meeting
since
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
mill
had
been
opened
to
him
and
she
kept
his
hand
leading
him
to
the
chair
by
her
side
to
have
no
cloud
between
herself
and
tom
was
still
a
perpetual
yearning
in
her
that
had
its
root
deeper
than
all
change
he
smiled
at
her
very
kindly
this
evening
and
said
well
magsie
how
aunt
moss
come
come
sir
said
glegg
putting
out
his
hand
why
such
a
big
man
you
carry
all
before
you
it
seems
you
come
into
your
luck
a
good
deal
earlier
than
us
old
folks
did
but
i
wish
you
joy
i
wish
you
joy
you
get
the
mill
all
for
your
own
again
some
day
i
be
bound
you
wo
stop
up
the
hill
but
i
hope
he
bear
in
mind
as
it
his
mother
family
as
he
owes
it
to
said
glegg
if
he
had
had
them
to
take
after
ha
been
poorly
off
there
was
never
any
failures
nor
lawing
nor
wastefulness
in
our
family
nor
dying
without
wills
no
nor
sudden
deaths
said
aunt
pullet
allays
the
doctor
called
in
but
tom
had
the
dodson
skin
i
said
that
from
the
first
and
i
do
know
what
mean
to
do
sister
glegg
but
i
mean
to
give
him
a
tablecloth
of
all
my
three
biggest
sizes
but
one
besides
sheets
i
do
say
what
more
i
shall
do
but
i
shall
do
and
if
i
should
die
pullet
you
bear
it
in
mind
though
you
be
blundering
with
the
keys
and
never
remember
as
that
on
the
third
shelf
o
the
wardrobe
behind
the
with
the
broad
ties
not
the
uns
is
the
key
of
the
drawer
in
the
blue
room
where
the
key
o
the
blue
closet
is
you
make
a
mistake
and
i
shall
niver
be
worthy
to
know
it
you
a
memory
for
my
pills
and
draughts
wonderful
i
allays
say
that
of
you
but
lost
among
the
keys
this
gloomy
prospect
of
the
confusion
that
would
ensue
on
her
decease
was
very
affecting
to
pullet
you
carry
it
too
far
sophy
that
locking
in
and
out
said
glegg
in
a
tone
of
some
disgust
at
this
folly
you
go
beyond
your
own
family
there
nobody
can
say
i
do
lock
up
but
i
do
reasonable
and
no
more
and
as
for
the
linen
i
shall
look
out
serviceable
to
make
a
present
of
to
my
nephey
i
got
cloth
as
has
never
been
whitened
better
worth
having
than
other
people
fine
holland
and
i
hope
he
lie
down
in
it
and
think
of
his
aunt
tom
thanked
glegg
but
evaded
any
promise
to
meditate
nightly
on
her
virtues
and
glegg
effected
a
diversion
for
him
by
asking
about
deane
intentions
concerning
steam
lucy
had
had
her
views
in
begging
tom
to
come
on
sindbad
it
appeared
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
that
the
was
to
ride
the
horse
and
cousin
tom
was
to
drive
home
his
mother
and
lucy
you
must
sit
by
yourself
aunty
said
that
contriving
young
lady
because
i
must
sit
by
tom
i
a
great
deal
to
say
to
him
in
the
eagerness
of
her
affectionate
anxiety
for
maggie
lucy
could
not
persuade
herself
to
defer
a
conversation
about
her
with
tom
who
she
thought
with
such
a
cup
of
joy
before
him
as
this
rapid
fulfilment
of
his
wish
about
the
mill
must
become
pliant
and
flexible
her
nature
supplied
her
with
no
key
to
tom
and
she
was
puzzled
as
well
as
pained
to
notice
the
unpleasant
change
on
his
countenance
when
she
gave
him
the
history
of
the
way
in
which
philip
had
used
his
influence
with
his
father
she
had
counted
on
this
revelation
as
a
great
stroke
of
policy
which
was
to
turn
tom
heart
toward
philip
at
once
and
besides
that
prove
that
the
elder
wakem
was
ready
to
receive
maggie
with
all
the
honors
of
a
nothing
was
wanted
then
but
for
dear
tom
who
always
had
that
pleasant
smile
when
he
looked
at
cousin
lucy
to
turn
completely
round
say
the
opposite
of
what
he
had
always
said
before
and
declare
that
he
for
his
part
was
delighted
that
all
the
old
grievances
should
be
healed
and
that
maggie
should
have
philip
with
all
suitable
despatch
in
cousin
lucy
opinion
nothing
could
be
easier
but
to
minds
strongly
marked
by
the
positive
and
negative
qualities
that
create
severity
strength
of
will
conscious
rectitude
of
purpose
narrowness
of
imagination
and
intellect
great
power
of
and
a
disposition
to
exert
control
over
others
prejudices
come
as
the
natural
food
of
tendencies
which
can
get
no
sustenance
out
of
that
complex
fragmentary
knowledge
which
we
call
truth
let
a
prejudice
be
bequeathed
carried
in
the
air
adopted
by
hearsay
caught
in
through
the
eye
however
it
may
come
these
minds
will
give
it
a
habitation
it
is
something
to
assert
strongly
and
bravely
something
to
fill
up
the
void
of
spontaneous
ideas
something
to
impose
on
others
with
the
authority
of
conscious
right
it
is
at
once
a
staff
and
a
baton
every
prejudice
that
will
answer
these
purposes
is
our
good
upright
tom
mind
was
of
this
class
his
inward
criticism
of
his
father
faults
did
not
prevent
him
from
adopting
his
father
prejudice
it
was
a
prejudice
against
a
man
of
lax
principle
and
lax
life
and
it
was
a
for
all
the
disappointed
feelings
of
family
and
personal
pride
other
feelings
added
their
force
to
produce
tom
bitter
repugnance
to
philip
and
to
maggie
union
with
him
and
notwithstanding
lucy
power
over
her
cousin
she
got
nothing
but
a
cold
refusal
ever
to
sanction
such
a
marriage
but
of
course
maggie
could
do
as
she
liked
she
had
declared
her
determination
to
be
independent
for
tom
part
he
held
himself
bound
by
his
duty
to
his
father
memory
and
by
every
manly
feeling
never
to
consent
to
any
relation
with
the
wakems
thus
all
that
lucy
had
effected
by
her
zealous
mediation
was
to
fill
tom
mind
with
the
expectation
that
maggie
perverse
resolve
to
go
into
a
situation
again
would
presently
metamorphose
itself
as
her
resolves
were
apt
to
do
into
something
equally
perverse
but
entirely
different
a
marriage
with
philip
wakem
chapter
xiii
borne
along
by
the
tide
in
less
than
a
week
maggie
was
at
ogg
again
outwardly
in
much
the
same
position
as
when
her
visit
there
had
just
begun
it
was
easy
for
her
to
fill
her
mornings
apart
from
lucy
without
any
obvious
effort
for
she
had
her
promised
visits
to
pay
to
her
aunt
glegg
and
it
was
natural
that
she
should
give
her
mother
more
than
usual
of
her
companionship
in
these
last
weeks
especially
as
there
were
preparations
to
be
thought
of
for
tom
housekeeping
but
lucy
would
hear
of
no
pretext
for
her
remaining
away
in
the
evenings
she
must
always
come
from
aunt
glegg
before
dinner
else
what
shall
i
have
of
you
said
lucy
with
a
tearful
pout
that
could
not
be
resisted
and
stephen
guest
had
unaccountably
taken
to
dining
at
as
often
as
possible
instead
of
avoiding
that
as
he
used
to
do
at
first
he
began
his
mornings
with
a
resolution
that
he
would
not
dine
there
not
even
go
in
the
evening
till
maggie
was
away
he
had
even
devised
a
plan
of
starting
off
on
a
journey
in
this
agreeable
june
weather
the
headaches
which
he
had
constantly
been
alleging
as
a
ground
for
stupidity
and
silence
were
a
sufficient
ostensible
motive
but
the
journey
was
not
taken
and
by
the
fourth
morning
no
distinct
resolution
was
formed
about
the
evenings
they
were
only
foreseen
as
times
when
maggie
would
still
be
present
for
a
little
while
when
one
more
touch
one
more
glance
might
be
snatched
for
why
not
there
was
nothing
to
conceal
between
them
they
knew
they
had
confessed
their
love
and
they
had
renounced
each
other
they
were
going
to
part
honor
and
conscience
were
going
to
divide
them
maggie
with
that
appeal
from
her
inmost
soul
had
decided
it
but
surely
they
might
cast
a
lingering
look
at
each
other
across
the
gulf
before
they
turned
away
never
to
look
again
till
that
strange
light
had
forever
faded
out
of
their
eyes
maggie
all
this
time
moved
about
with
a
quiescence
and
even
torpor
of
manner
so
contrasted
with
her
usual
fitful
brightness
and
ardor
that
lucy
would
have
had
to
seek
some
other
cause
for
such
a
change
if
she
had
not
been
convinced
that
the
position
in
which
maggie
stood
between
philip
and
her
brother
and
the
prospect
of
her
wearisome
banishment
were
quite
enough
to
account
for
a
large
amount
of
depression
but
under
this
torpor
there
was
a
fierce
battle
of
emotions
such
as
maggie
in
all
her
life
of
struggle
had
never
known
or
foreboded
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
all
the
worst
evil
in
her
had
lain
in
ambush
till
now
and
had
suddenly
started
up
with
hideous
overpowering
strength
there
were
moments
in
which
a
cruel
selfishness
seemed
to
be
getting
possession
of
her
why
should
not
lucy
why
should
not
philip
suffer
had
had
to
suffer
through
many
years
of
her
life
and
who
had
renounced
anything
for
her
and
when
something
like
that
fulness
of
existence
love
wealth
ease
refinement
all
that
her
nature
craved
was
brought
within
her
reach
why
was
she
to
forego
it
that
another
might
have
it
another
who
perhaps
needed
it
less
but
amidst
all
this
new
passionate
tumult
there
were
the
old
voices
making
themselves
heard
with
rising
power
till
from
time
to
time
the
tumult
seemed
quelled
that
existence
which
tempted
her
the
full
existence
she
dreamed
where
then
would
be
all
the
memories
of
early
striving
all
the
deep
pity
for
another
pain
which
had
been
nurtured
in
her
through
years
of
affection
and
hardship
all
the
divine
presentiment
of
something
higher
than
mere
personal
enjoyment
which
had
made
the
sacredness
of
life
she
might
as
well
hope
to
enjoy
walking
by
maiming
her
feet
as
hope
to
enjoy
an
existence
in
which
she
set
out
by
maiming
the
faith
and
sympathy
that
were
the
best
organs
of
her
soul
and
then
if
pain
were
so
hard
to
what
was
it
to
others
ah
god
preserve
me
from
inflicting
give
me
strength
to
bear
it
how
had
she
sunk
into
this
struggle
with
a
temptation
that
she
would
once
have
thought
herself
as
secure
from
as
from
deliberate
crime
when
was
that
first
hateful
moment
in
which
she
had
been
conscious
of
a
feeling
that
clashed
with
her
truth
affection
and
gratitude
and
had
not
shaken
it
from
her
with
horror
as
if
it
had
been
a
loathsome
thing
and
yet
since
this
strange
sweet
subduing
influence
did
not
should
not
conquer
her
since
it
was
to
remain
simply
her
own
suffering
her
mind
was
meeting
stephen
in
that
thought
of
his
that
they
might
still
snatch
moments
of
mute
confession
before
the
parting
came
for
was
not
he
suffering
too
she
saw
it
daily
saw
it
in
the
sickened
look
of
fatigue
with
which
as
soon
as
he
was
not
compelled
to
exert
himself
he
relapsed
into
indifference
toward
everything
but
the
possibility
of
watching
her
could
she
refuse
sometimes
to
answer
that
beseeching
look
which
she
felt
to
be
following
her
like
a
low
murmur
of
love
and
pain
she
refused
it
less
and
less
till
at
last
the
evening
for
them
both
was
sometimes
made
of
a
moment
mutual
gaze
they
thought
of
it
till
it
came
and
when
it
had
come
they
thought
of
nothing
else
one
other
thing
stephen
seemed
now
and
then
to
care
for
and
that
was
to
sing
it
was
a
way
of
speaking
to
maggie
perhaps
he
was
not
distinctly
conscious
that
he
was
impelled
to
it
by
a
secret
longing
running
counter
to
all
his
resolves
to
deepen
the
hold
he
had
on
her
watch
your
own
speech
and
notice
how
it
is
guided
by
your
less
conscious
purposes
and
you
will
understand
that
contradiction
in
stephen
philip
wakem
was
a
less
frequent
visitor
but
he
came
occasionally
in
the
evening
and
it
happened
that
he
was
there
when
lucy
said
as
they
sat
out
on
the
lawn
near
sunset
now
maggie
tale
of
visits
to
aunt
glegg
is
completed
i
mean
that
we
shall
go
out
boating
every
day
until
she
goes
she
has
not
had
half
enough
boating
because
of
these
tiresome
visits
and
she
likes
it
better
than
anything
do
you
maggie
better
than
any
sort
of
locomotion
i
hope
you
mean
said
philip
smiling
at
maggie
who
was
lolling
backward
in
a
low
else
she
will
be
selling
her
soul
to
that
ghostly
boatman
who
haunts
the
floss
only
for
the
sake
of
being
drifted
in
a
boat
forever
should
you
like
to
be
her
boatman
said
lucy
because
if
you
would
you
can
come
with
us
and
take
an
oar
if
the
floss
were
but
a
quiet
lake
instead
of
a
river
we
should
be
independent
of
any
gentleman
for
maggie
can
row
splendidly
as
it
is
we
are
reduced
to
ask
services
of
knights
and
squires
who
do
not
seem
to
offer
them
with
great
alacrity
she
looked
playful
reproach
at
stephen
who
was
sauntering
up
and
down
and
was
just
singing
in
pianissimo
falsetto
the
thirst
that
from
the
soul
doth
rise
doth
ask
a
drink
divine
he
took
no
notice
but
still
kept
aloof
he
had
done
so
frequently
during
philip
recent
visits
you
do
seem
inclined
for
boating
said
lucy
when
he
came
to
sit
down
by
her
on
the
bench
does
rowing
suit
you
now
oh
i
hate
a
large
party
in
a
boat
he
said
almost
irritably
come
when
you
have
no
one
else
lucy
colored
fearing
that
philip
would
be
hurt
it
was
quite
a
new
thing
for
stephen
to
speak
in
that
way
but
he
had
certainly
not
been
well
of
late
philip
colored
too
but
less
from
a
feeling
of
personal
offence
than
from
a
vague
suspicion
that
stephen
moodiness
had
some
relation
to
maggie
who
had
started
up
from
her
chair
as
he
spoke
and
had
walked
toward
the
hedge
of
laurels
to
look
at
the
descending
sunlight
on
the
river
as
miss
deane
did
know
she
was
excluding
others
by
inviting
me
said
philip
i
am
bound
to
resign
no
indeed
you
shall
not
said
lucy
much
vexed
i
particularly
wish
for
your
company
the
tide
will
suit
at
ten
it
will
be
a
delicious
time
for
a
couple
of
hours
to
row
to
luckreth
and
walk
back
before
the
sun
gets
too
hot
and
how
can
you
object
to
four
people
in
a
boat
she
added
looking
at
stephen
i
do
object
to
the
people
but
the
number
said
stephen
who
had
recovered
himself
and
was
rather
ashamed
of
his
rudeness
if
i
voted
for
a
fourth
at
all
of
course
it
would
be
you
phil
but
we
divide
the
pleasure
of
escorting
the
ladies
we
take
it
alternately
i
go
the
next
day
this
incident
had
the
effect
of
drawing
philip
attention
with
freshened
solicitude
toward
stephen
and
maggie
but
when
they
the
house
music
was
proposed
and
tulliver
and
deane
being
occupied
with
cribbage
maggie
sat
apart
near
the
table
where
the
books
and
work
were
placed
doing
nothing
however
but
listening
abstractedly
to
the
music
stephen
presently
turned
to
a
duet
which
he
insisted
that
lucy
and
philip
should
sing
he
had
often
done
the
same
thing
before
but
this
evening
philip
thought
he
divined
some
double
intention
in
every
word
and
look
of
stephen
and
watched
him
keenly
angry
with
himself
all
the
while
for
this
clinging
suspicion
for
had
not
maggie
virtually
denied
any
ground
for
his
doubts
on
her
side
and
she
was
truth
itself
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
her
word
and
glance
when
they
had
last
spoken
together
in
the
garden
stephen
might
be
strongly
fascinated
by
her
what
was
more
natural
but
philip
felt
himself
rather
base
for
intruding
on
what
must
be
his
friend
painful
secret
still
he
watched
stephen
moving
away
from
the
piano
sauntered
slowly
toward
the
table
near
which
maggie
sat
and
turned
over
the
newspapers
apparently
in
mere
idleness
then
he
seated
himself
with
his
back
to
the
piano
dragging
a
newspaper
under
his
elbow
and
thrusting
his
hand
through
his
hair
as
if
he
had
been
attracted
by
some
bit
of
local
news
in
the
laceham
courier
he
was
in
reality
looking
at
maggie
who
had
not
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
his
approach
she
had
always
additional
strength
of
resistance
when
philip
was
present
just
as
we
can
restrain
our
speech
better
in
a
spot
that
we
feel
to
be
hallowed
but
at
last
she
heard
the
word
dearest
uttered
in
the
softest
tone
of
pained
entreaty
like
that
of
a
patient
who
asks
for
something
that
ought
to
have
been
given
without
asking
she
had
never
heard
that
word
since
the
moments
in
the
lane
at
basset
when
it
had
come
from
stephen
again
and
again
almost
as
involuntarily
as
if
it
had
been
an
inarticulate
cry
philip
could
hear
no
word
but
he
had
moved
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
piano
and
could
see
maggie
start
and
blush
raise
her
eyes
an
instant
toward
stephen
face
but
immediately
look
apprehensively
toward
himself
it
was
not
evident
to
her
that
philip
had
observed
her
but
a
pang
of
shame
under
the
sense
of
this
concealment
made
her
move
from
her
chair
and
walk
to
her
mother
side
to
watch
the
game
at
cribbage
philip
went
home
soon
after
in
a
state
of
hideous
doubt
mingled
with
wretched
certainty
it
was
impossible
for
him
now
to
resist
the
conviction
that
there
was
some
mutual
consciousness
between
stephen
and
maggie
and
for
half
the
night
his
irritable
susceptible
nerves
were
pressed
upon
almost
to
frenzy
by
that
one
wretched
fact
he
could
attempt
no
explanation
that
would
reconcile
it
with
her
words
and
actions
when
at
last
the
need
for
belief
in
maggie
rose
to
its
habitual
predominance
he
was
not
long
in
imagining
the
truth
she
was
struggling
she
was
banishing
herself
this
was
the
clue
to
all
he
had
seen
since
his
return
but
athwart
that
belief
there
came
other
possibilities
that
would
not
be
driven
out
of
sight
his
imagination
wrought
out
the
whole
story
stephen
was
madly
in
love
with
her
he
must
have
told
her
so
she
had
rejected
him
and
was
hurrying
away
but
would
he
give
her
up
knowing
philip
felt
the
fact
with
despair
that
she
was
made
half
helpless
by
her
feeling
toward
him
when
the
morning
came
philip
was
too
ill
to
think
of
keeping
his
engagement
to
go
in
the
boat
in
his
present
agitation
he
could
decide
on
nothing
he
could
only
alternate
between
contradictory
intentions
first
he
thought
he
must
have
an
interview
with
maggie
and
entreat
her
to
confide
in
him
then
again
he
distrusted
his
own
interference
had
he
not
been
thrusting
himself
on
maggie
all
along
she
had
uttered
words
long
ago
in
her
young
ignorance
it
was
enough
to
make
her
hate
him
that
these
should
be
continually
present
with
her
as
a
bond
and
had
he
any
right
to
ask
her
for
a
revelation
of
feelings
which
she
had
evidently
intended
to
withhold
from
him
he
would
not
trust
himself
to
see
her
till
he
had
assured
himself
that
he
could
act
from
pure
anxiety
for
her
and
not
from
egoistic
irritation
he
wrote
a
brief
note
to
stephen
and
sent
it
early
by
the
servant
saying
that
he
was
not
well
enough
to
fulfil
his
engagement
to
miss
deane
would
stephen
take
his
excuse
and
fill
his
place
lucy
had
arranged
a
charming
plan
which
had
made
her
quite
content
with
stephen
refusal
to
go
in
the
boat
she
discovered
that
her
father
was
to
drive
to
lindum
this
morning
at
ten
lindum
was
the
very
place
she
wanted
to
go
to
to
make
purchases
important
purchases
which
must
by
no
means
be
put
off
to
another
opportunity
and
aunt
tulliver
must
go
too
because
she
was
concerned
in
some
of
the
purchases
you
will
have
your
row
in
the
boat
just
the
same
you
know
she
said
to
maggie
when
they
went
out
of
the
and
upstairs
together
philip
will
be
here
it
ten
and
it
is
a
delicious
morning
now
do
say
a
word
against
it
you
dear
dolorous
thing
what
is
the
use
of
my
being
a
fairy
godmother
if
you
set
your
face
against
all
the
wonders
i
work
for
you
do
think
of
awful
cousin
tom
you
may
disobey
him
a
little
maggie
did
not
persist
in
objecting
she
was
almost
glad
of
the
plan
for
perhaps
it
would
bring
her
some
strength
and
calmness
to
be
alone
with
philip
again
it
was
like
revisiting
the
scene
of
a
quieter
life
in
which
the
very
struggles
were
repose
compared
with
the
daily
tumult
of
the
present
she
prepared
herself
for
the
boat
and
at
ten
sat
waiting
in
the
the
ring
of
the
was
punctual
and
she
was
thinking
with
affectionate
pleasure
of
the
surprise
philip
would
have
in
finding
that
he
was
to
be
with
her
alone
when
she
distinguished
a
firm
rapid
step
across
the
hall
that
was
certainly
not
philip
the
door
opened
and
stephen
guest
entered
in
the
first
moment
they
were
both
too
much
agitated
to
speak
for
stephen
had
learned
from
the
servant
that
the
others
were
gone
out
maggie
had
started
up
and
sat
down
again
with
her
heart
beating
violently
and
stephen
throwing
down
his
cap
and
gloves
came
and
sat
by
her
in
silence
she
thought
philip
would
be
coming
soon
and
with
great
effort
for
she
trembled
visibly
she
rose
to
go
to
a
distant
chair
he
is
not
coming
said
stephen
in
a
low
tone
i
am
going
in
the
boat
oh
we
ca
go
said
maggie
sinking
into
her
chair
again
lucy
did
not
expect
she
would
be
hurt
why
is
not
philip
come
he
is
not
well
he
asked
me
to
come
instead
lucy
is
gone
to
lindum
said
maggie
taking
off
her
bonnet
with
hurried
trembling
fingers
we
must
not
go
very
well
said
stephen
dreamily
looking
at
her
as
he
rested
his
arm
on
the
back
of
his
chair
then
we
stay
here
he
was
looking
into
her
deep
deep
eyes
far
off
and
mysterious
at
the
starlit
blackness
and
yet
very
near
and
timidly
loving
maggie
sat
perfectly
still
perhaps
for
moments
perhaps
for
minutes
until
the
helpless
trembling
had
ceased
and
there
was
a
warm
glow
on
her
check
the
man
is
waiting
he
has
taken
the
cushions
she
said
will
you
go
and
tell
him
what
shall
i
tell
him
said
stephen
almost
in
a
whisper
he
was
looking
at
the
lips
now
maggie
made
no
answer
let
us
go
stephen
murmured
entreatingly
rising
and
taking
her
hand
to
raise
her
too
we
shall
not
be
long
together
and
they
went
maggie
felt
that
she
was
being
led
down
the
garden
among
the
roses
being
helped
with
firm
tender
care
into
the
boat
having
the
cushion
and
cloak
arranged
for
her
feet
and
her
parasol
opened
for
her
which
she
had
forgotten
all
by
this
stronger
presence
that
seemed
to
bear
her
along
without
any
act
of
her
own
will
like
the
added
self
which
comes
with
the
sudden
exalting
influence
of
a
strong
tonic
and
she
felt
nothing
else
memory
was
excluded
they
glided
rapidly
along
stephen
rowing
helped
by
the
tide
past
the
tofton
trees
and
houses
on
between
the
silent
sunny
fields
and
pastures
which
seemed
filled
with
a
natural
joy
that
had
no
reproach
for
theirs
the
breath
of
the
young
unwearied
day
the
delicious
rhythmic
dip
of
the
oars
the
fragmentary
song
of
a
passing
bird
heard
now
and
then
as
if
it
were
only
the
overflowing
of
brimful
gladness
the
sweet
solitude
of
a
twofold
consciousness
that
was
mingled
into
one
by
that
grave
untiring
gaze
which
need
not
be
averted
what
else
could
there
be
in
their
minds
for
the
first
hour
some
low
subdued
languid
exclamation
of
love
came
from
stephen
from
time
to
time
as
he
went
on
rowing
idly
half
automatically
otherwise
they
spoke
no
word
for
what
could
words
have
been
but
an
inlet
to
thought
and
thought
did
not
belong
to
that
enchanted
haze
in
which
they
were
enveloped
it
belonged
to
the
past
and
the
future
that
lay
outside
the
haze
maggie
was
only
dimly
conscious
of
the
banks
as
they
passed
them
and
dwelt
with
no
recognition
on
the
villages
she
knew
there
were
several
to
be
passed
before
they
reached
luckreth
where
they
always
stopped
and
left
the
boat
at
all
times
she
was
so
liable
to
fits
of
absence
that
she
was
likely
enough
to
let
her
waymarks
pass
unnoticed
but
at
last
stephen
who
had
been
rowing
more
and
more
idly
ceased
to
row
laid
down
the
oars
folded
his
arms
and
looked
down
on
the
water
as
if
watching
the
pace
at
which
the
boat
glided
without
his
help
this
sudden
change
roused
maggie
she
looked
at
the
fields
at
the
banks
close
by
and
felt
that
they
were
entirely
strange
to
her
a
terrible
alarm
took
possession
of
her
oh
have
we
passed
luckreth
where
we
were
to
stop
she
exclaimed
looking
back
to
see
if
the
place
were
out
of
sight
no
village
was
to
be
seen
she
turned
around
again
with
a
look
of
distressed
questioning
at
stephen
he
went
on
watching
the
water
and
said
in
a
strange
dreamy
absent
tone
yes
a
long
way
oh
what
shall
i
do
cried
maggie
in
an
agony
we
shall
not
get
home
for
hours
and
lucy
o
god
help
me
she
clasped
her
hands
and
broke
into
a
sob
like
a
frightened
child
she
thought
of
nothing
but
of
meeting
lucy
and
seeing
her
look
of
pained
surprise
and
doubt
perhaps
of
just
upbraiding
stephen
moved
and
sat
near
her
and
gently
drew
down
the
clasped
hands
maggie
he
said
in
a
deep
tone
of
slow
decision
let
us
never
go
home
again
till
no
one
can
part
us
till
we
are
married
the
unusual
tone
the
startling
words
arrested
maggie
sob
and
she
sat
quite
still
wondering
as
if
stephen
might
have
seen
some
possibilities
that
would
alter
everything
and
annul
the
wretched
facts
see
maggie
how
everything
has
come
without
our
seeking
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
we
never
thought
of
being
alone
together
again
it
has
all
been
done
by
others
see
how
the
tide
is
carrying
us
out
away
from
all
those
unnatural
bonds
that
we
have
been
trying
to
make
faster
round
us
and
trying
in
vain
it
will
carry
us
on
to
torby
and
we
can
land
there
and
get
some
carriage
and
hurry
on
to
york
and
then
to
scotland
and
never
pause
a
moment
till
we
are
bound
to
each
other
so
that
only
death
can
part
us
it
is
the
only
right
thing
dearest
it
is
the
only
way
of
escaping
from
this
wretched
entanglement
everything
has
concurred
to
point
it
out
to
us
we
have
contrived
nothing
we
have
thought
of
nothing
ourselves
stephen
spoke
with
deep
earnest
pleading
maggie
listened
passing
from
her
startled
wonderment
to
the
yearning
after
that
belief
that
the
tide
was
doing
it
all
that
she
might
glide
along
with
the
swift
silent
stream
and
not
struggle
any
more
but
across
that
stealing
influence
came
the
terrible
shadow
of
past
thoughts
and
the
sudden
horror
lest
now
at
last
the
moment
of
fatal
intoxication
was
close
upon
her
called
up
feelings
of
angry
resistance
toward
stephen
let
me
go
she
said
in
an
agitated
tone
flashing
an
indignant
look
at
him
and
trying
to
get
her
hands
free
you
have
wanted
to
deprive
me
of
any
choice
you
knew
we
were
come
too
far
you
have
dared
to
take
advantage
of
my
thoughtlessness
it
is
unmanly
to
bring
me
into
such
a
position
stung
by
this
reproach
he
released
her
hands
moved
back
to
his
former
place
and
folded
his
arms
in
a
sort
of
desperation
at
the
difficulty
maggie
words
had
made
present
to
him
if
she
would
not
consent
to
go
on
he
must
curse
himself
for
the
embarrassment
he
had
led
her
into
but
the
reproach
was
the
unendurable
thing
the
one
thing
worse
than
parting
with
her
was
that
she
should
feel
he
had
acted
unworthily
toward
her
at
last
he
said
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
rage
i
did
notice
that
we
had
passed
luckreth
till
we
had
got
to
the
next
village
and
then
it
came
into
my
mind
that
we
would
go
on
i
ca
justify
it
i
ought
to
have
told
you
it
is
enough
to
make
you
hate
me
since
you
do
love
me
well
enough
to
make
everything
else
indifferent
to
you
as
i
do
you
shall
i
stop
the
boat
and
try
to
get
you
out
here
i
tell
lucy
that
i
was
mad
and
that
you
hate
me
and
you
shall
be
clear
of
me
forever
no
one
can
blame
you
because
i
have
behaved
unpardonably
to
you
maggie
was
paralyzed
it
was
easier
to
resist
stephen
pleading
than
this
picture
he
had
called
up
of
himself
suffering
while
she
was
vindicated
easier
even
to
turn
away
from
his
look
of
tenderness
than
from
this
look
of
angry
misery
that
seemed
to
place
her
in
selfish
isolation
from
him
he
had
called
up
a
state
of
feeling
in
which
the
reasons
which
had
acted
on
her
conscience
seemed
to
be
transmitted
into
mere
the
indignant
fire
in
her
eyes
was
quenched
and
she
began
to
look
at
him
with
timid
distress
she
had
reproached
him
for
being
hurried
into
irrevocable
trespass
she
who
had
been
so
weak
herself
as
if
i
should
feel
what
happened
to
you
just
the
same
she
said
with
reproach
of
another
kind
the
reproach
of
love
asking
for
more
trust
this
yielding
to
the
idea
of
stephen
suffering
was
more
fatal
than
the
other
yielding
because
it
was
less
distinguishable
from
that
sense
of
others
claims
which
was
the
moral
basis
of
her
resistance
he
felt
all
the
relenting
in
her
look
and
tone
it
was
heaven
opening
again
he
moved
to
her
side
and
took
her
hand
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
back
of
the
boat
and
saying
nothing
he
dreaded
to
utter
another
word
he
dreaded
to
make
another
movement
that
might
provoke
another
reproach
or
denial
from
her
life
hung
on
her
consent
everything
else
was
hopeless
confused
sickening
misery
they
glided
along
in
this
way
both
resting
in
that
silence
as
in
a
haven
both
dreading
lest
their
feelings
should
be
divided
again
till
they
became
aware
that
the
clouds
had
gathered
and
that
the
slightest
perceptible
freshening
of
the
breeze
was
growing
and
growing
so
that
the
whole
character
of
the
day
was
altered
you
will
be
chill
maggie
in
this
thin
dress
let
me
raise
the
cloak
over
your
shoulders
get
up
an
instant
dearest
maggie
obeyed
there
was
an
unspeakable
charm
in
being
told
what
to
do
and
having
everything
decided
for
her
she
sat
down
again
covered
with
the
cloak
and
stephen
took
to
his
oars
again
making
haste
for
they
must
try
to
get
to
torby
as
fast
as
they
could
maggie
was
hardly
conscious
of
having
said
or
done
anything
decisive
all
yielding
is
attended
with
a
less
vivid
consciousness
than
resistance
it
is
the
partial
sleep
of
thought
it
is
the
submergence
of
our
own
personality
by
another
every
influence
tended
to
lull
her
into
acquiescence
that
dreamy
gliding
in
the
boat
which
had
lasted
for
four
hours
and
had
brought
some
weariness
and
exhaustion
the
recoil
of
her
fatigued
sensations
from
the
impracticable
difficulty
of
getting
out
of
the
boat
at
this
unknown
distance
from
home
and
walking
for
long
miles
all
helped
to
bring
her
into
more
complete
subjection
to
that
strong
mysterious
charm
which
made
a
last
parting
from
stephen
seem
the
death
of
all
joy
and
made
the
thought
of
wounding
him
like
the
first
touch
of
the
torturing
iron
before
which
resolution
shrank
and
then
there
was
the
present
happiness
of
being
with
him
which
was
enough
to
absorb
all
her
languid
energy
presently
stephen
observed
a
vessel
coming
after
them
several
vessels
among
them
the
steamer
to
mudport
had
passed
them
with
the
early
tide
but
for
the
last
hour
they
had
seen
none
he
looked
more
and
more
eagerly
at
this
vessel
as
if
a
new
thought
had
come
into
his
mind
along
with
it
and
then
he
looked
at
maggie
hesitatingly
maggie
dearest
he
said
at
last
if
this
vessel
should
be
going
to
mudport
or
to
any
convenient
place
on
the
coast
northward
it
would
be
our
best
plan
to
get
them
to
take
us
on
board
you
are
fatigued
and
it
may
soon
rain
it
may
be
a
wretched
business
getting
to
torby
in
this
boat
it
only
a
trading
vessel
but
i
dare
say
you
can
be
made
tolerably
comfortable
we
take
the
cushions
out
of
the
boat
it
is
really
our
best
plan
they
be
glad
enough
to
take
us
got
plenty
of
money
about
me
i
can
pay
them
well
maggie
heart
began
to
beat
with
reawakened
alarm
at
this
new
proposition
but
she
was
silent
one
course
seemed
as
difficult
as
another
stephen
hailed
the
vessel
it
was
a
dutch
vessel
going
to
mudport
the
english
mate
informed
him
and
if
this
wind
held
would
be
there
in
less
than
two
days
we
had
got
out
too
far
with
our
boat
said
stephen
i
was
trying
to
make
for
torby
but
i
afraid
of
the
weather
and
this
lady
my
wife
will
be
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
hunger
take
us
on
board
will
you
and
haul
up
the
boat
i
pay
you
well
maggie
now
really
faint
and
trembling
with
fear
was
taken
on
board
making
an
interesting
object
of
contemplation
to
admiring
dutchmen
the
mate
feared
the
lady
would
have
a
poor
time
of
it
on
board
for
they
had
no
accommodation
for
such
entirely
passengers
no
private
cabin
larger
than
an
but
at
least
they
had
dutch
cleanliness
which
makes
all
other
inconveniences
tolerable
and
the
boat
cushions
were
spread
into
a
couch
for
maggie
on
the
poop
with
all
alacrity
but
to
pace
up
and
down
the
deck
leaning
on
stephen
being
upheld
by
his
strength
was
the
first
change
that
she
needed
then
came
food
and
then
quiet
reclining
on
the
cushions
with
the
sense
that
no
new
resolution
be
taken
that
day
everything
must
wait
till
stephen
sat
beside
her
with
her
hand
in
his
they
could
only
speak
to
each
other
in
low
tones
only
look
at
each
other
now
and
then
for
it
would
take
a
long
while
to
dull
the
curiosity
of
the
five
men
on
board
and
reduce
these
handsome
young
strangers
to
that
minor
degree
of
interest
which
belongs
in
a
sailor
regard
to
all
objects
nearer
than
the
horizon
but
stephen
was
triumphantly
happy
every
other
thought
or
care
was
thrown
into
unmarked
perspective
by
the
certainty
that
maggie
must
be
his
the
leap
had
been
taken
now
he
had
been
tortured
by
scruples
he
had
fought
fiercely
with
overmastering
inclination
he
had
hesitated
but
repentance
was
impossible
he
murmured
forth
in
fragmentary
sentences
his
happiness
his
adoration
his
tenderness
his
belief
that
their
life
together
must
be
heaven
that
her
presence
with
him
would
give
rapture
to
every
common
day
that
to
satisfy
her
lightest
wish
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
other
bliss
that
everything
was
easy
for
her
sake
except
to
part
with
her
and
now
they
never
part
he
would
belong
to
her
forever
and
all
that
was
his
was
hers
had
no
value
for
him
except
as
it
was
hers
such
things
uttered
in
low
broken
tones
by
the
one
voice
that
has
first
stirred
the
fibre
of
young
passion
have
only
a
feeble
effect
on
experienced
minds
at
a
distance
from
them
to
poor
maggie
they
were
very
near
they
were
like
nectar
held
close
to
thirsty
lips
there
was
there
be
then
a
life
for
mortals
here
below
which
was
not
hard
and
chill
in
which
affection
would
no
longer
be
stephen
passionate
words
made
the
vision
of
such
a
life
more
fully
present
to
her
than
it
had
ever
been
before
and
the
vision
for
the
time
excluded
all
realities
all
except
the
returning
which
broke
out
on
the
waters
as
the
evening
approached
and
mingled
with
the
visionary
sunlight
of
promised
happiness
all
except
the
hand
that
pressed
hers
and
the
voice
that
spoke
to
her
and
the
eyes
that
looked
at
her
with
grave
unspeakable
love
there
was
to
be
no
rain
after
all
the
clouds
rolled
off
to
the
horizon
again
making
the
great
purple
rampart
and
long
purple
isles
of
that
wondrous
land
which
reveals
itself
to
us
when
the
sun
goes
down
the
land
that
the
evening
star
watches
over
maggie
was
to
sleep
all
night
on
the
poop
it
was
better
than
going
below
and
she
was
covered
with
the
warmest
wrappings
the
ship
could
furnish
it
was
still
early
when
the
fatigues
of
the
day
brought
on
a
drowsy
longing
for
perfect
rest
and
she
laid
down
her
head
looking
at
the
faint
dying
flush
in
the
west
where
the
one
golden
lamp
was
getting
brighter
and
brighter
then
she
looked
up
at
stephen
who
was
still
seated
by
her
hanging
over
her
as
he
leaned
his
arm
against
the
vessel
side
behind
all
the
delicious
visions
of
these
last
hours
which
had
flowed
over
her
like
a
soft
stream
and
made
her
entirely
passive
there
was
the
dim
consciousness
that
the
condition
was
a
transient
one
and
that
the
morrow
must
bring
back
the
old
life
of
struggle
that
there
were
thoughts
which
would
presently
avenge
themselves
for
this
oblivion
but
now
nothing
was
distinct
to
her
she
was
being
lulled
to
sleep
with
that
soft
stream
still
flowing
over
her
with
those
delicious
visions
melting
and
fading
like
the
wondrous
aerial
land
of
the
west
chapter
xiv
waking
when
maggie
was
gone
to
sleep
stephen
weary
too
with
his
unaccustomed
amount
of
rowing
and
with
the
intense
inward
life
of
the
last
twelve
hours
but
too
restless
to
sleep
walked
and
lounged
about
the
deck
with
his
cigar
far
on
into
midnight
not
seeing
the
dark
water
hardly
conscious
there
were
stars
living
only
in
the
near
and
distant
future
at
last
fatigue
conquered
restlessness
and
he
rolled
himself
up
in
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
on
the
deck
near
maggie
feet
she
had
fallen
asleep
before
nine
and
had
been
sleeping
for
six
hours
before
the
faintest
hint
of
a
midsummer
daybreak
was
discernible
she
awoke
from
that
vivid
dreaming
which
makes
the
margin
of
our
deeper
rest
she
was
in
a
boat
on
the
wide
water
with
stephen
and
in
the
gathering
darkness
something
like
a
star
appeared
that
grew
and
grew
till
they
saw
it
was
the
virgin
seated
in
ogg
boat
and
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
till
they
saw
the
virgin
was
lucy
and
the
boatman
was
philip
no
not
philip
but
her
brother
who
rowed
past
without
looking
at
her
and
she
rose
to
stretch
out
her
arms
and
call
to
him
and
their
own
boat
turned
over
with
the
movement
and
they
began
to
sink
till
with
one
spasm
of
dread
she
seemed
to
awake
and
find
she
was
a
child
again
in
the
parlor
at
evening
twilight
and
tom
was
not
really
angry
from
the
soothed
sense
of
that
false
waking
she
passed
to
the
real
waking
to
the
plash
of
water
against
the
vessel
and
the
sound
of
a
footstep
on
the
deck
and
the
awful
starlit
sky
there
was
a
moment
of
utter
bewilderment
before
her
mind
could
get
disentangled
from
the
confused
web
of
dreams
but
soon
the
whole
terrible
truth
urged
itself
upon
her
stephen
was
not
by
her
now
she
was
alone
with
her
own
memory
and
her
own
dread
the
irrevocable
wrong
that
must
blot
her
life
had
been
committed
she
had
brought
sorrow
into
the
lives
of
others
into
the
lives
that
were
knit
up
with
hers
by
trust
and
love
the
feeling
of
a
few
short
weeks
had
hurried
her
into
the
sins
her
nature
had
most
recoiled
from
breach
of
faith
and
cruel
selfishness
she
had
rent
the
ties
that
had
given
meaning
to
duty
and
had
made
herself
an
outlawed
soul
with
no
guide
but
the
wayward
choice
of
her
own
passion
and
where
would
that
lead
her
where
had
it
led
her
now
she
had
said
she
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
that
temptation
she
felt
it
now
now
that
the
consequences
of
such
a
fall
had
come
before
the
outward
act
was
completed
there
was
at
least
this
fruit
from
all
her
years
of
striving
after
the
highest
and
best
that
her
soul
though
betrayed
beguiled
ensnared
could
never
deliberately
consent
to
a
choice
of
the
lower
and
a
choice
of
what
o
god
not
a
choice
of
joy
but
of
conscious
cruelty
and
hardness
for
could
she
ever
cease
to
see
before
her
lucy
and
philip
with
their
murdered
trust
and
hopes
her
life
with
stephen
could
have
no
sacredness
she
must
forever
sink
and
wander
vaguely
driven
by
uncertain
impulse
for
she
had
let
go
the
clue
of
life
that
clue
which
once
in
the
years
her
young
need
had
clutched
so
strongly
she
had
renounced
all
delights
then
before
she
knew
them
before
they
had
come
within
her
reach
philip
had
been
right
when
he
told
her
that
she
knew
nothing
of
renunciation
she
had
thought
it
was
quiet
ecstasy
she
saw
it
face
to
face
now
that
sad
patient
loving
strength
which
holds
the
clue
of
life
and
saw
that
the
thorns
were
forever
pressing
on
its
brow
the
yesterday
which
could
never
be
revoked
if
she
could
have
changed
it
now
for
any
length
of
inward
silent
endurance
she
would
have
bowed
beneath
that
cross
with
a
sense
of
rest
day
break
came
and
the
reddening
eastern
light
while
her
past
life
was
grasping
her
in
this
way
with
that
tightening
clutch
which
comes
in
the
last
moments
of
possible
rescue
she
could
see
stephen
now
lying
on
the
deck
still
fast
asleep
and
with
the
sight
of
him
there
came
a
wave
of
anguish
that
found
its
way
in
a
sob
the
worst
bitterness
of
parting
the
thought
that
urged
the
sharpest
inward
cry
for
help
was
the
pain
it
must
give
to
but
surmounting
everything
was
the
horror
at
her
own
possible
failure
the
dread
lest
her
conscience
should
be
benumbed
again
and
not
rise
to
energy
till
it
was
too
late
too
late
it
was
too
late
already
not
to
have
caused
misery
too
late
for
everything
perhaps
but
to
rush
away
from
the
last
act
of
baseness
the
tasting
of
joys
that
were
wrung
from
crushed
hearts
the
sun
was
rising
now
and
maggie
started
up
with
the
sense
that
a
day
of
resistance
was
beginning
for
her
her
eyelashes
were
still
wet
with
tears
as
with
her
shawl
over
her
head
she
sat
looking
at
the
slowly
rounding
sun
something
roused
stephen
too
and
getting
up
from
his
hard
bed
he
came
to
sit
beside
her
the
sharp
instinct
of
anxious
love
saw
something
to
give
him
alarm
in
the
very
first
glance
he
had
a
hovering
dread
of
some
resistance
in
maggie
nature
that
he
would
be
unable
to
overcome
he
had
the
uneasy
consciousness
that
he
had
robbed
her
of
perfect
freedom
yesterday
there
was
too
much
native
honor
in
him
for
him
not
to
feel
that
if
her
will
should
recoil
his
conduct
would
have
been
odious
and
she
would
have
a
right
to
reproach
him
but
maggie
did
not
feel
that
right
she
was
too
conscious
of
fatal
weakness
in
herself
too
full
of
the
tenderness
that
comes
with
the
foreseen
need
for
inflicting
a
wound
she
let
him
take
her
hand
when
he
came
to
sit
down
beside
her
and
smiled
at
him
only
with
rather
a
sad
glance
she
could
say
nothing
to
pain
him
till
the
moment
of
possible
parting
was
nearer
and
so
they
drank
their
cup
of
coffee
together
and
walked
about
the
deck
and
heard
the
captain
assurance
that
they
should
be
in
at
mudport
by
five
each
with
an
inward
burthen
but
in
him
it
was
an
undefined
fear
which
he
trusted
to
the
coming
hours
to
dissipate
in
her
it
was
a
definite
resolve
on
which
she
was
trying
silently
to
tighten
her
hold
stephen
was
continually
through
the
morning
expressing
his
anxiety
at
the
fatigue
and
discomfort
she
was
suffering
and
alluded
to
landing
and
to
the
change
of
motion
and
repose
she
would
have
in
a
carriage
wanting
to
assure
himself
more
completely
by
presupposing
that
everything
would
be
as
he
had
arranged
it
for
a
long
while
maggie
contented
herself
with
assuring
him
that
she
had
had
a
good
night
rest
and
that
she
mind
about
being
on
the
vessel
it
was
not
like
being
on
the
open
sea
it
was
only
a
little
less
pleasant
than
being
in
a
boat
on
the
floss
but
a
suppressed
resolve
will
betray
itself
in
the
eyes
and
stephen
became
more
and
more
uneasy
as
the
day
advanced
under
the
sense
that
maggie
had
entirely
lost
her
passiveness
he
longed
but
did
not
dare
to
speak
of
their
marriage
of
where
they
would
go
after
it
and
the
steps
he
would
take
to
inform
his
father
and
the
rest
of
what
had
happened
he
longed
to
assure
himself
of
a
tacit
assent
from
her
but
each
time
he
looked
at
her
he
gathered
a
stronger
dread
of
the
new
quiet
sadness
with
which
she
met
his
eyes
and
they
were
more
and
more
silent
here
we
are
in
sight
of
mudport
he
said
at
last
now
dearest
he
added
turning
toward
her
with
a
look
that
was
half
beseeching
the
worst
part
of
your
fatigue
is
over
on
the
land
we
can
command
swiftness
in
another
hour
and
a
half
we
shall
be
in
a
chaise
together
and
that
will
seem
rest
to
you
after
this
maggie
felt
it
was
time
to
speak
it
would
only
be
unkind
now
to
assent
by
silence
she
spoke
in
the
lowest
tone
as
he
had
done
but
with
distinct
decision
we
shall
not
be
together
we
shall
have
parted
the
blood
rushed
to
stephen
face
we
shall
not
he
said
i
die
first
it
was
as
he
had
dreaded
there
was
a
struggle
coming
but
neither
of
them
dared
to
say
another
word
till
the
boat
was
let
down
and
they
were
taken
to
the
here
there
was
a
cluster
of
gazers
and
passengers
awaiting
the
departure
of
the
steamboat
to
ogg
maggie
had
a
dim
sense
when
she
had
landed
and
stephen
was
hurrying
her
along
on
his
arm
that
some
one
had
advanced
toward
her
from
that
cluster
as
if
he
were
coming
to
speak
to
her
but
she
was
hurried
along
and
was
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
coming
trial
a
porter
guided
them
to
the
nearest
inn
and
and
stephen
gave
the
order
for
the
chaise
as
they
passed
through
the
yard
maggie
took
no
notice
of
this
and
only
said
ask
them
to
show
us
into
a
room
where
we
can
sit
down
when
they
entered
maggie
did
not
sit
down
and
stephen
whose
face
had
a
desperate
determination
in
it
was
about
to
ring
the
bell
when
she
said
in
a
firm
voice
i
not
going
we
must
part
here
maggie
he
said
turning
round
toward
her
and
speaking
in
the
tones
of
a
man
who
feels
a
process
of
torture
beginning
do
you
mean
to
kill
me
what
is
the
use
of
it
now
the
whole
thing
is
done
no
it
is
not
done
said
maggie
too
much
is
done
more
than
we
can
ever
remove
the
trace
of
but
i
will
go
no
farther
do
try
to
prevail
with
me
again
i
could
choose
yesterday
what
was
he
to
do
he
dared
not
go
near
her
her
anger
might
leap
out
and
make
a
new
barrier
he
walked
backward
and
forward
in
maddening
perplexity
maggie
he
said
at
last
pausing
before
her
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
imploring
wretchedness
have
some
pity
hear
me
forgive
me
for
what
i
did
yesterday
i
will
obey
you
now
i
will
do
nothing
without
your
full
consent
but
do
blight
our
lives
forever
by
a
rash
perversity
that
can
answer
no
good
purpose
to
any
one
that
can
only
create
new
evils
sit
down
dearest
wait
think
what
you
are
going
to
do
do
treat
me
as
if
you
could
trust
me
he
had
chosen
the
most
effective
appeal
but
maggie
will
was
fixed
unswervingly
on
the
coming
wrench
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
suffer
we
must
not
wait
she
said
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
we
must
part
at
once
we
part
maggie
said
stephen
more
impetuously
i
bear
it
what
is
the
use
of
inflicting
that
misery
on
me
the
blow
whatever
it
may
have
been
has
been
struck
now
will
it
help
any
one
else
that
you
should
drive
me
mad
i
will
not
begin
any
future
even
for
you
said
maggie
tremulously
with
a
deliberate
consent
to
what
ought
not
to
have
been
what
i
told
you
at
basset
i
feel
now
i
would
rather
have
died
than
fall
into
this
temptation
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
parted
forever
then
but
we
must
part
now
we
will
part
stephen
burst
out
instinctively
placing
his
back
against
the
door
forgetting
everything
he
had
said
a
few
moments
before
i
will
not
endure
it
you
make
me
desperate
i
know
what
i
do
maggie
trembled
she
felt
that
the
parting
could
not
be
effected
suddenly
she
must
rely
on
a
slower
appeal
to
stephen
better
self
she
must
be
prepared
for
a
harder
task
than
that
of
rushing
away
while
resolution
was
fresh
she
sat
down
stephen
watching
her
with
that
look
of
desperation
which
had
come
over
him
like
a
lurid
light
approached
slowly
from
the
door
seated
himself
close
beside
her
and
grasped
her
hand
her
heart
beat
like
the
heart
of
a
frightened
bird
but
this
direct
opposition
helped
her
she
felt
her
determination
growing
stronger
remember
what
you
felt
weeks
ago
she
began
with
beseeching
earnestness
remember
what
we
both
felt
that
we
owed
ourselves
to
others
and
must
conquer
every
inclination
which
could
make
us
false
to
that
debt
we
have
failed
to
keep
our
resolutions
but
the
wrong
remains
the
same
no
it
does
remain
the
same
said
stephen
we
have
proved
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
our
resolutions
we
have
proved
that
the
feeling
which
draws
us
toward
each
other
is
too
strong
to
be
overcome
that
natural
law
surmounts
every
other
we
ca
help
what
it
clashes
with
it
is
not
so
stephen
i
quite
sure
that
is
wrong
i
have
tried
to
think
it
again
and
again
but
i
see
if
we
judged
in
that
way
there
would
be
a
warrant
for
all
treachery
and
cruelty
we
should
justify
breaking
the
most
sacred
ties
that
can
ever
be
formed
on
earth
if
the
past
is
not
to
bind
us
where
can
duty
lie
we
should
have
no
law
but
the
inclination
of
the
moment
but
there
are
ties
that
ca
be
kept
by
mere
resolution
said
stephen
starting
up
and
walking
about
again
what
is
outward
faithfulness
would
they
have
thanked
us
for
anything
so
hollow
as
constancy
without
love
maggie
did
not
answer
immediately
she
was
undergoing
an
inward
as
well
as
an
outward
contest
at
last
she
said
with
a
passionate
assertion
of
her
conviction
as
much
against
herself
as
against
him
that
seems
right
at
first
but
when
i
look
further
i
sure
it
is
right
faithfulness
and
constancy
mean
something
else
besides
doing
what
is
easiest
and
pleasantest
to
ourselves
they
mean
renouncing
whatever
is
opposed
to
the
reliance
others
have
in
us
whatever
would
cause
misery
to
those
whom
the
course
of
our
lives
has
made
dependent
on
us
if
we
if
i
had
been
better
nobler
those
claims
would
have
been
so
strongly
present
with
me
i
should
have
felt
them
pressing
on
my
heart
so
continually
just
as
they
do
now
in
the
moments
when
my
conscience
is
awake
that
the
opposite
feeling
would
never
have
grown
in
me
as
it
has
done
it
would
have
been
quenched
at
once
i
should
have
prayed
for
help
so
earnestly
i
should
have
rushed
away
as
we
rush
from
hideous
danger
i
feel
no
excuse
for
myself
none
i
should
never
have
failed
toward
lucy
and
philip
as
i
have
done
if
i
had
not
been
weak
selfish
and
hard
able
to
think
of
their
pain
without
a
pain
to
myself
that
would
have
destroyed
all
temptation
oh
what
is
lucy
feeling
now
she
believed
in
me
she
loved
me
she
was
so
good
to
me
think
of
her
maggie
voice
was
getting
choked
as
she
uttered
these
last
words
i
think
of
her
said
stephen
stamping
as
if
with
pain
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
you
maggie
you
demand
of
a
man
what
is
impossible
i
felt
that
once
but
i
ca
go
back
to
it
now
and
where
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
it
except
to
torture
me
you
save
them
from
pain
now
you
can
only
tear
yourself
from
me
and
make
my
life
worthless
to
me
and
even
if
we
could
go
back
and
both
fulfil
our
engagements
if
that
were
possible
now
it
would
be
hateful
horrible
to
think
of
your
ever
being
philip
wife
of
your
ever
being
the
wife
of
a
man
you
did
love
we
have
both
been
rescued
from
a
mistake
a
deep
flush
came
over
maggie
face
and
she
could
speak
stephen
saw
this
he
sat
down
again
taking
her
hand
in
his
and
looking
at
her
with
passionate
entreaty
maggie
dearest
if
you
love
me
you
are
mine
who
can
have
so
great
a
claim
on
you
as
i
have
my
life
is
bound
up
in
your
love
there
is
nothing
in
the
past
that
can
annul
our
right
to
each
other
it
is
the
first
time
we
have
either
of
us
loved
with
our
whole
heart
and
soul
maggie
was
still
silent
for
a
little
while
looking
down
stephen
was
in
a
flutter
of
new
hope
he
was
going
to
triumph
but
she
raised
her
eyes
and
met
his
with
a
glance
that
was
filled
with
the
anguish
of
regret
not
with
yielding
no
not
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
stephen
she
said
with
timid
resolution
i
have
never
consented
to
it
with
my
whole
mind
there
are
memories
and
affections
and
longings
after
perfect
goodness
that
have
such
a
strong
hold
on
me
they
would
never
quit
me
for
long
they
would
come
back
and
be
pain
to
me
repentance
i
could
live
in
peace
if
i
put
the
shadow
of
a
wilful
sin
between
myself
and
god
i
have
caused
sorrow
already
i
know
i
feel
it
but
i
have
never
deliberately
consented
to
it
i
have
never
said
shall
suffer
that
i
may
have
joy
it
has
never
been
my
will
to
marry
you
if
you
were
to
win
consent
from
the
momentary
triumph
of
my
feeling
for
you
you
would
not
have
my
whole
soul
if
i
could
wake
back
again
into
the
time
before
yesterday
i
would
choose
to
be
true
to
my
calmer
affections
and
live
without
the
joy
of
love
stephen
loosed
her
hand
and
rising
impatiently
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
suppressed
rage
good
god
he
burst
out
at
last
what
a
miserable
thing
a
love
is
to
a
man
i
could
commit
crimes
for
you
and
you
can
balance
and
choose
in
that
way
but
you
love
me
if
you
had
a
tithe
of
the
feeling
for
me
that
i
have
for
you
it
would
be
impossible
to
you
to
think
for
a
moment
of
sacrificing
me
but
it
weighs
nothing
with
you
that
you
are
robbing
me
of
happiness
maggie
pressed
her
fingers
together
almost
convulsively
as
she
held
them
clasped
on
her
lap
a
great
terror
was
upon
her
as
if
she
were
ever
and
anon
seeing
where
she
stood
by
great
flashes
of
lightning
and
then
again
stretched
forth
her
hands
in
the
darkness
no
i
do
sacrifice
you
i
could
sacrifice
you
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
again
but
i
ca
believe
in
a
good
for
you
that
i
feel
that
we
both
feel
is
a
wrong
toward
others
we
choose
happiness
either
for
ourselves
or
for
another
we
ca
tell
where
that
will
lie
we
can
only
choose
whether
we
will
indulge
ourselves
in
the
present
moment
or
whether
we
will
renounce
that
for
the
sake
of
obeying
the
divine
voice
within
us
for
the
sake
of
being
true
to
all
the
motives
that
sanctify
our
lives
i
know
this
belief
is
hard
it
has
slipped
away
from
me
again
and
again
but
i
have
felt
that
if
i
let
it
go
forever
i
should
have
no
light
through
the
darkness
of
this
life
but
maggie
said
stephen
seating
himself
by
her
again
is
it
possible
you
do
see
that
what
happened
yesterday
has
altered
the
whole
position
of
things
what
infatuation
is
it
what
obstinate
prepossession
that
blinds
you
to
that
it
is
too
late
to
say
what
we
might
have
done
or
what
we
ought
to
have
done
admitting
the
very
worst
view
of
what
has
been
done
it
is
a
fact
we
must
act
on
now
our
position
is
altered
the
right
course
is
no
longer
what
it
was
before
we
must
accept
our
own
actions
and
start
afresh
from
them
suppose
we
had
been
married
yesterday
it
is
nearly
the
same
thing
the
effect
on
others
would
not
have
been
different
it
would
only
have
made
this
difference
to
ourselves
stephen
added
bitterly
that
you
might
have
acknowledged
then
that
your
tie
to
me
was
stronger
than
to
others
again
a
deep
flush
came
over
maggie
face
and
she
was
silent
stephen
thought
again
that
he
was
beginning
to
prevail
he
had
never
yet
believed
that
he
should
prevail
there
are
possibilities
which
our
minds
shrink
from
too
completely
for
us
to
fear
them
dearest
he
said
in
his
deepest
tenderest
tone
leaning
toward
her
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
you
mine
now
the
world
believes
it
duty
must
spring
out
of
that
now
in
a
few
hours
you
will
be
legally
mine
and
those
who
had
claims
on
us
will
submit
they
will
see
that
there
was
a
force
which
declared
against
their
claims
maggie
eyes
opened
wide
in
one
terrified
look
at
the
face
that
was
close
to
hers
and
she
started
up
pale
again
oh
i
ca
do
it
she
said
in
a
voice
almost
of
agony
stephen
do
ask
me
do
urge
me
i
ca
argue
any
longer
i
do
know
what
is
wise
but
my
heart
will
not
let
me
do
it
i
see
i
feel
their
trouble
now
it
is
as
if
it
were
branded
on
my
mind
have
suffered
and
had
no
one
to
pity
me
and
now
i
have
made
others
suffer
it
would
never
leave
me
it
would
embitter
your
love
to
me
i
care
for
philip
in
a
different
way
i
remember
all
we
said
to
each
other
i
know
how
he
thought
of
me
as
the
one
promise
of
his
life
he
was
given
to
me
that
i
might
make
his
lot
less
hard
and
i
have
forsaken
him
and
lucy
she
has
been
deceived
she
who
trusted
me
more
than
any
one
i
can
not
marry
you
i
can
not
take
a
good
for
myself
that
has
been
wrung
out
of
their
misery
it
is
not
the
force
that
ought
to
rule
us
this
that
we
feel
for
each
other
it
would
rend
me
away
from
all
that
my
past
life
has
made
dear
and
holy
to
me
i
set
out
on
a
fresh
life
and
forget
that
i
must
go
back
to
it
and
cling
to
it
else
i
shall
feel
as
if
there
were
nothing
firm
beneath
my
feet
good
god
maggie
said
stephen
rising
too
and
grasping
her
arm
you
rave
how
can
you
go
back
without
marrying
me
you
do
know
what
will
be
said
dearest
you
see
nothing
as
it
really
is
yes
i
do
but
they
will
believe
me
i
will
confess
everything
lucy
will
believe
me
she
will
forgive
you
and
and
oh
good
will
come
by
clinging
to
the
right
dear
dear
stephen
let
me
go
drag
me
into
deeper
remorse
my
whole
soul
has
never
consented
it
does
not
consent
now
stephen
let
go
her
arm
and
sank
back
on
his
chair
by
despairing
rage
he
was
silent
a
few
moments
not
looking
at
her
while
her
eyes
were
turned
toward
him
yearningly
in
alarm
at
this
sudden
change
at
last
he
said
still
without
looking
at
her
go
then
leave
me
do
torture
me
any
longer
i
ca
bear
it
involuntarily
she
leaned
toward
him
and
put
out
her
hand
to
touch
his
but
he
shrank
from
it
as
if
it
had
been
burning
iron
and
said
again
leave
me
maggie
was
not
conscious
of
a
decision
as
she
turned
away
from
that
gloomy
averted
face
and
walked
out
of
the
room
it
was
like
an
automatic
action
that
fulfils
a
forgotten
intention
what
came
after
a
sense
of
stairs
descended
as
if
in
a
dream
of
flagstones
of
a
chaise
and
horses
standing
then
a
street
and
a
turning
into
another
street
where
a
was
standing
taking
in
passengers
and
the
darting
thought
that
that
coach
would
take
her
away
perhaps
toward
home
but
she
could
ask
nothing
yet
she
only
got
into
the
coach
home
where
her
mother
and
brother
were
philip
lucy
the
scene
of
her
very
cares
and
trials
was
the
haven
toward
which
her
mind
tended
the
sanctuary
where
sacred
relics
lay
where
she
would
be
rescued
from
more
falling
the
thought
of
stephen
was
like
a
horrible
throbbing
pain
which
yet
as
such
pains
do
seemed
to
urge
all
other
thoughts
into
activity
but
among
her
thoughts
what
others
would
say
and
think
of
her
conduct
was
hardly
present
love
and
deep
pity
and
remorseful
anguish
left
no
room
for
that
the
coach
was
taking
her
to
york
farther
away
from
home
but
she
did
not
learn
that
until
she
was
set
down
in
the
old
city
at
midnight
it
was
no
matter
she
could
sleep
there
and
start
home
the
next
day
she
had
her
purse
in
her
pocket
with
all
her
money
in
it
a
and
a
sovereign
she
had
kept
it
in
her
pocket
from
forgetfulness
after
going
out
to
make
purchases
the
day
before
yesterday
did
she
lie
down
in
the
gloomy
bedroom
of
the
old
inn
that
night
with
her
will
bent
unwaveringly
on
the
path
of
penitent
sacrifice
the
great
struggles
of
life
are
not
so
easy
as
that
the
great
problems
of
life
are
not
so
clear
in
the
darkness
of
that
night
she
saw
face
turned
toward
her
in
passionate
reproachful
misery
she
lived
through
again
all
the
tremulous
delights
of
his
presence
with
her
that
made
existence
an
easy
floating
in
a
stream
of
joy
instead
of
a
quiet
resolved
endurance
and
effort
the
love
she
had
renounced
came
back
upon
her
with
a
cruel
charm
she
felt
herself
opening
her
arms
to
receive
it
once
more
and
then
it
seemed
to
slip
away
and
fade
and
vanish
leaving
only
the
dying
sound
of
a
deep
thrilling
voice
that
said
gone
forever
gone
book
vii
final
chapter
i
the
return
to
the
mill
between
four
and
five
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
from
that
on
which
stephen
and
maggie
had
left
ogg
tom
tulliver
was
standing
on
the
gravel
walk
outside
the
old
house
at
dorlcote
mill
he
was
master
there
now
he
had
half
fulfilled
his
father
dying
wish
and
by
years
of
steady
and
energetic
work
he
had
brought
himself
near
to
the
attainment
of
more
than
the
old
respectability
which
had
been
the
proud
inheritance
of
the
dodsons
and
tullivers
but
tom
face
as
he
stood
in
the
hot
still
sunshine
of
that
summer
afternoon
had
no
gladness
no
triumph
in
it
his
mouth
wore
its
bitterest
expression
his
severe
brow
its
hardest
and
deepest
fold
as
he
drew
down
his
hat
farther
over
his
eyes
to
shelter
them
from
the
sun
and
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
gravel
no
news
of
his
sister
had
been
heard
since
bob
jakin
had
come
back
in
the
steamer
from
mudport
and
put
an
end
to
all
improbable
suppositions
of
an
accident
on
the
water
by
stating
that
he
had
seen
her
land
from
a
vessel
with
stephen
guest
would
the
next
news
be
that
she
was
married
or
what
probably
that
she
was
not
married
tom
mind
was
set
to
the
expectation
of
the
worst
that
could
happen
not
death
but
disgrace
as
he
was
walking
with
his
back
toward
the
entrance
gate
and
his
face
toward
the
rushing
a
tall
figure
that
we
know
well
approached
the
gate
and
paused
to
look
at
him
with
a
heart
her
brother
was
the
human
being
of
whom
she
had
been
most
afraid
from
her
childhood
upward
afraid
with
that
fear
which
springs
in
us
when
we
love
one
who
is
inexorable
unbending
unmodifiable
with
a
mind
that
we
can
never
mould
ourselves
upon
and
yet
that
we
can
not
endure
to
alienate
from
us
that
fear
was
shaking
maggie
now
but
her
mind
was
unswervingly
bent
on
returning
to
her
brother
as
the
natural
refuge
that
had
been
given
her
in
her
deep
humiliation
under
the
retrospect
of
her
own
weakness
in
her
anguish
at
the
injury
she
had
inflicted
she
almost
desired
to
endure
the
severity
of
reproof
to
submit
in
patient
silence
to
that
harsh
disapproving
judgment
against
which
she
had
so
often
rebelled
it
seemed
no
more
than
just
to
her
now
who
was
weaker
than
she
was
she
craved
that
outward
help
to
her
better
purpose
which
would
come
from
complete
submissive
confession
from
being
in
the
presence
of
those
whose
looks
and
words
would
be
a
reflection
of
her
own
conscience
maggie
had
been
kept
on
her
bed
at
york
for
a
day
with
that
prostrating
headache
which
was
likely
to
follow
on
the
terrible
strain
of
the
previous
day
and
night
there
was
an
expression
of
physical
pain
still
about
her
brow
and
eyes
and
her
whole
appearance
with
her
dress
so
long
unchanged
was
worn
and
distressed
she
lifted
the
latch
of
the
gate
and
walked
in
slowly
tom
did
not
hear
the
gate
he
was
just
then
close
upon
the
roaring
dam
but
he
presently
turned
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
saw
the
figure
whose
worn
look
and
loneliness
seemed
to
him
a
confirmation
of
his
worst
conjectures
he
paused
trembling
and
white
with
disgust
and
indignation
maggie
paused
too
three
yards
before
him
she
felt
the
hatred
in
his
face
felt
it
rushing
through
her
fibres
but
she
must
speak
tom
she
began
faintly
i
am
come
back
to
you
i
am
come
back
home
for
refuge
to
tell
you
everything
you
will
find
no
home
with
me
he
answered
with
tremulous
rage
you
have
disgraced
us
all
you
have
disgraced
my
father
name
you
have
been
a
curse
to
your
best
friends
you
have
been
base
deceitful
no
motives
are
strong
enough
to
restrain
you
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
forever
you
do
belong
to
me
their
mother
had
come
to
the
door
now
she
stood
paralyzed
by
the
double
shock
of
seeing
maggie
and
hearing
tom
words
tom
said
maggie
with
more
courage
i
am
perhaps
not
so
guilty
as
you
believe
me
to
be
i
never
meant
to
give
way
to
my
feelings
i
struggled
against
them
i
was
carried
too
far
in
the
boat
to
come
back
on
tuesday
i
came
back
as
soon
as
i
could
i
ca
believe
in
you
any
more
said
tom
gradually
passing
from
the
tremulous
excitement
of
the
first
moment
to
cold
inflexibility
you
have
been
carrying
on
a
clandestine
relation
with
stephen
guest
as
you
did
before
with
another
he
went
to
see
you
at
my
aunt
moss
you
walked
alone
with
him
in
the
lanes
you
must
have
behaved
as
no
modest
girl
would
have
done
to
her
cousin
lover
else
that
could
never
have
happened
the
people
at
luckreth
saw
you
pass
you
passed
all
the
other
places
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
you
have
been
using
philip
wakem
as
a
screen
to
deceive
lucy
the
kindest
friend
you
ever
had
go
and
see
the
return
you
have
made
her
ill
unable
to
speak
my
mother
ca
go
near
her
lest
she
should
remind
her
of
you
maggie
was
half
stunned
too
heavily
pressed
upon
by
her
anguish
even
to
discern
any
difference
between
her
actual
guilt
and
her
accusations
still
less
to
vindicate
herself
tom
she
said
crushing
her
hands
together
under
her
cloak
in
the
effort
to
speak
again
whatever
i
have
done
i
repent
it
bitterly
i
want
to
make
amends
i
will
endure
anything
i
want
to
be
kept
from
doing
wrong
again
what
keep
you
said
tom
with
cruel
bitterness
not
religion
not
your
natural
feelings
of
gratitude
and
honor
and
he
he
would
deserve
to
be
shot
if
it
were
not
but
you
are
ten
times
worse
than
he
is
i
loathe
your
character
and
your
conduct
you
struggled
with
your
feelings
you
say
yes
have
had
feelings
to
struggle
with
but
i
conquered
them
i
have
had
a
harder
life
than
you
have
had
but
i
have
found
comfort
in
doing
my
duty
but
i
will
sanction
no
such
character
as
yours
the
world
shall
know
that
feel
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
if
you
are
in
want
i
will
provide
for
you
let
my
mother
know
but
you
shall
not
come
under
my
roof
it
is
enough
that
i
have
to
bear
the
thought
of
your
disgrace
the
sight
of
you
is
hateful
to
me
slowly
maggie
was
turning
away
with
despair
in
her
heart
but
the
poor
frightened
mother
love
leaped
out
now
stronger
than
all
dread
my
child
i
go
with
you
you
got
a
mother
oh
the
sweet
rest
of
that
embrace
to
the
maggie
more
helpful
than
all
wisdom
is
one
draught
of
simple
human
pity
that
will
not
forsake
us
tom
turned
and
walked
into
the
house
come
in
my
child
tulliver
whispered
he
let
you
stay
and
sleep
in
my
bed
he
wo
deny
that
if
i
ask
him
no
mother
said
maggie
in
a
low
tone
like
a
moan
i
will
never
go
in
then
wait
for
me
outside
i
get
ready
and
come
with
you
when
his
mother
appeared
with
her
bonnet
on
tom
came
out
to
her
in
the
passage
and
put
money
into
her
hands
my
house
is
yours
mother
always
he
said
you
will
come
and
let
me
know
everything
you
want
you
will
come
back
to
me
poor
tulliver
took
the
money
too
frightened
to
say
anything
the
only
thing
clear
to
her
was
the
mother
instinct
that
she
would
go
with
her
unhappy
child
maggie
was
waiting
outside
the
gate
she
took
her
mother
hand
and
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
mother
said
maggie
at
last
we
will
go
to
luke
cottage
luke
will
take
me
in
he
was
very
good
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
he
got
no
room
for
us
my
dear
now
his
wife
got
so
many
children
i
do
know
where
to
go
if
it
is
to
one
o
your
aunts
and
i
hardly
durst
said
poor
tulliver
quite
destitute
of
mental
resources
in
this
extremity
maggie
was
silent
a
little
while
and
then
said
let
us
go
to
bob
jakin
mother
his
wife
will
have
room
for
us
if
they
have
no
other
lodger
so
they
went
on
their
way
to
ogg
to
the
old
house
by
the
bob
himself
was
at
home
with
a
heaviness
at
heart
which
resisted
even
the
new
joy
and
pride
of
possessing
a
baby
quite
the
liveliest
of
its
age
that
had
ever
been
born
to
prince
or
packman
he
would
perhaps
not
so
thoroughly
have
understood
all
the
dubiousness
of
maggie
appearance
with
stephen
guest
on
the
quay
at
mudport
if
he
had
not
witnessed
the
effect
it
produced
on
tom
when
he
went
to
report
it
and
since
then
the
circumstances
which
in
any
case
gave
a
disastrous
character
to
her
elopement
had
passed
beyond
the
more
polite
circles
of
ogg
and
had
become
matter
of
common
talk
accessible
to
the
grooms
and
so
that
when
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
maggie
standing
before
him
in
her
sorrow
and
weariness
he
had
no
questions
to
ask
except
one
which
he
dared
only
ask
himself
where
was
stephen
guest
bob
for
his
part
hoped
he
might
be
in
the
warmest
department
of
an
asylum
understood
to
exist
in
the
other
world
for
gentlemen
who
are
likely
to
be
in
fallen
circumstances
there
the
lodgings
were
vacant
and
both
jakin
the
larger
and
jakin
the
less
were
commanded
to
make
all
things
comfortable
for
the
old
missis
and
the
young
miss
alas
that
she
was
still
miss
the
ingenious
bob
was
sorely
perplexed
as
to
how
this
result
could
have
come
about
how
stephen
guest
could
have
gone
away
from
her
or
could
have
let
her
go
away
from
him
when
he
had
the
chance
of
keeping
her
with
him
but
he
was
silent
and
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
ask
him
a
question
would
not
present
himself
in
the
room
lest
it
should
appear
like
intrusion
and
a
wish
to
pry
having
the
same
chivalry
toward
maggie
as
in
the
days
when
he
had
bought
her
the
memorable
present
of
books
but
after
a
day
or
two
tulliver
was
gone
to
the
mill
again
for
a
few
hours
to
see
to
tom
household
matters
maggie
had
wished
this
after
the
first
violent
outburst
of
feeling
which
came
as
soon
as
she
had
no
longer
any
active
purpose
to
fulfil
she
was
less
in
need
of
her
mother
presence
she
even
desired
to
be
alone
with
her
grief
but
she
had
been
solitary
only
a
little
while
in
the
old
that
looked
on
the
river
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
turning
round
her
sad
face
as
she
said
come
in
she
saw
bob
enter
with
the
baby
in
his
arms
and
mumps
at
his
heels
we
go
back
if
it
disturbs
you
miss
said
bob
no
said
maggie
in
a
low
voice
wishing
she
could
smile
bob
closing
the
door
behind
him
came
and
stood
before
her
you
see
we
got
a
little
un
miss
and
i
want
you
to
look
at
it
and
take
it
in
your
arms
if
you
be
so
good
for
we
made
free
to
name
it
after
you
and
it
be
better
for
your
takin
a
bit
notice
on
it
maggie
could
not
speak
but
she
put
out
her
arms
to
receive
the
tiny
baby
while
mumps
snuffed
at
it
anxiously
to
ascertain
that
this
transference
was
all
right
maggie
heart
had
swelled
at
this
action
and
speech
of
bob
she
knew
well
enough
that
it
was
a
way
he
had
chosen
to
show
his
sympathy
and
respect
sit
down
bob
she
said
presently
and
he
sat
down
in
silence
finding
his
tongue
unmanageable
in
quite
a
new
fashion
refusing
to
say
what
he
wanted
it
to
say
bob
she
said
after
a
few
moments
looking
down
at
the
baby
and
holding
it
anxiously
as
if
she
feared
it
might
slip
from
her
mind
and
her
fingers
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
do
you
speak
so
miss
said
bob
grasping
the
skin
of
neck
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
should
look
upon
it
as
a
day
earnings
i
want
you
to
go
to
kenn
and
ask
to
speak
to
him
and
tell
him
that
i
am
here
and
should
be
very
grateful
if
he
would
come
to
me
while
my
mother
is
away
she
will
not
come
back
till
evening
eh
miss
i
do
it
in
a
minute
it
is
but
a
step
but
wife
lies
dead
she
to
be
buried
died
the
day
i
come
from
mudport
it
all
the
more
pity
she
should
ha
died
just
now
if
you
want
him
i
hardly
like
to
go
him
yet
oh
no
bob
said
maggie
we
must
let
it
be
till
after
a
few
days
perhaps
when
you
hear
that
he
is
going
about
again
but
perhaps
he
may
be
going
out
of
town
to
a
distance
she
added
with
a
new
sense
of
despondency
at
this
idea
not
he
miss
said
bob
none
go
away
he
is
one
o
them
gentlefolks
as
go
to
cry
at
when
their
wives
die
got
summat
else
to
do
he
looks
fine
and
sharp
after
the
parish
he
does
he
christened
the
little
un
an
he
was
me
to
know
what
i
did
of
a
sunday
as
i
did
come
to
church
but
i
told
him
i
was
the
travel
three
parts
o
the
sundays
an
then
i
so
used
to
on
my
legs
i
ca
sit
so
long
on
end
lors
sir
says
i
packman
can
do
wi
a
small
o
church
it
tastes
strong
says
i
no
call
to
lay
it
on
thick
eh
miss
how
good
the
little
un
is
wi
you
it
like
as
if
it
knowed
you
it
partly
does
i
be
bound
like
the
birds
know
the
mornin
bob
tongue
was
now
evidently
loosed
from
its
unwonted
bondage
and
might
even
be
in
danger
of
doing
more
work
than
was
required
of
it
but
the
subjects
on
which
he
longed
to
be
informed
were
so
steep
and
difficult
of
approach
that
his
tongue
was
likely
to
run
on
along
the
level
rather
than
to
carry
him
on
that
unbeaten
road
he
felt
this
and
was
silent
again
for
a
little
while
ruminating
much
on
the
possible
forms
in
which
he
might
put
a
question
at
last
he
said
in
a
more
timid
voice
than
usual
will
you
give
me
leave
to
ask
you
only
one
thing
miss
maggie
was
rather
startled
but
she
answered
yes
bob
if
it
is
about
myself
not
about
any
one
else
well
miss
it
this
you
owe
anybody
a
grudge
no
not
any
one
said
maggie
looking
up
at
him
inquiringly
why
oh
lors
miss
said
bob
pinching
mumps
neck
harder
than
ever
i
wish
you
did
an
tell
me
i
leather
him
till
i
could
see
i
would
an
the
justice
might
do
what
he
liked
to
me
arter
oh
bob
said
maggie
smiling
faintly
you
a
very
good
friend
to
me
but
i
should
like
to
punish
any
one
even
if
they
done
me
wrong
i
done
wrong
myself
too
often
this
view
of
things
was
puzzling
to
bob
and
threw
more
obscurity
than
ever
over
what
could
possibly
have
happened
between
stephen
and
maggie
but
further
questions
would
have
been
too
intrusive
even
if
he
could
have
framed
them
suitably
and
he
was
obliged
to
carry
baby
away
again
to
an
expectant
mother
happen
you
like
mumps
for
company
miss
he
said
when
he
had
taken
the
baby
again
he
rare
company
mumps
is
he
knows
iverything
makes
no
bother
about
it
if
i
tell
him
he
lie
before
you
watch
you
as
still
just
as
he
watches
my
pack
you
better
let
me
leave
him
a
bit
he
get
fond
on
you
lors
it
a
fine
thing
to
hev
a
dumb
brute
fond
on
you
it
stick
to
you
an
make
no
jaw
yes
do
leave
him
please
said
maggie
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
mumps
for
a
friend
mumps
lie
down
there
said
bob
pointing
to
a
place
in
front
of
maggie
and
niver
do
you
stir
till
you
spoke
to
mumps
lay
down
at
once
and
made
no
sign
of
restlessness
when
his
master
left
the
room
chapter
ii
ogg
passes
judgment
it
was
soon
known
throughout
ogg
that
miss
tulliver
was
come
back
she
had
not
then
eloped
in
order
to
be
married
to
stephen
guest
at
all
events
stephen
guest
had
not
married
her
which
came
to
the
same
thing
so
far
as
her
culpability
was
concerned
we
judge
others
according
to
results
how
else
not
knowing
the
process
by
which
results
are
arrived
at
if
miss
tulliver
after
a
few
months
of
travel
had
returned
as
stephen
guest
with
a
and
all
the
advantages
possessed
even
by
the
most
unwelcome
wife
of
an
only
son
public
opinion
which
at
ogg
as
else
where
always
knew
what
to
think
would
have
judged
in
strict
consistency
with
those
results
public
opinion
in
these
cases
is
always
of
the
feminine
gender
not
the
world
but
the
wife
and
she
would
have
seen
that
two
handsome
young
people
the
gentleman
of
quite
the
first
family
in
ogg
having
found
themselves
in
a
false
position
had
been
led
into
a
course
which
to
say
the
least
of
it
was
highly
injudicious
and
productive
of
sad
pain
and
disappointment
especially
to
that
sweet
young
thing
miss
deane
stephen
guest
had
certainly
not
behaved
well
but
then
young
men
were
liable
to
those
sudden
infatuated
attachments
and
bad
as
it
might
seem
in
stephen
guest
to
admit
the
faintest
advances
from
her
cousin
lover
indeed
it
been
said
that
she
was
actually
engaged
to
young
wakem
old
wakem
himself
had
mentioned
it
still
she
was
very
young
and
a
deformed
young
man
you
know
and
young
guest
so
very
fascinating
and
they
say
he
positively
worships
her
to
be
sure
that
ca
last
and
he
ran
away
with
her
in
the
boat
quite
against
her
will
and
what
could
she
do
she
could
come
back
then
no
one
would
have
spoken
to
her
and
how
very
well
that
satinette
becomes
her
complexion
it
seems
as
if
the
folds
in
front
were
quite
come
in
several
of
her
dresses
are
made
so
they
say
he
thinks
nothing
too
handsome
to
buy
for
her
poor
miss
deane
she
is
very
pitiable
but
then
there
was
no
positive
engagement
and
the
air
at
the
coast
will
do
her
good
after
all
if
young
guest
felt
no
more
for
her
than
it
was
better
for
her
not
to
marry
him
what
a
wonderful
marriage
for
a
girl
like
miss
tulliver
quite
romantic
why
young
guest
will
put
up
for
the
borough
at
the
next
election
nothing
like
commerce
nowadays
that
young
wakem
nearly
went
out
of
his
mind
he
always
rather
queer
but
he
gone
abroad
again
to
be
out
of
the
way
quite
the
best
thing
for
a
deformed
young
man
miss
unit
declares
she
will
never
visit
and
stephen
guest
such
nonsense
pretending
to
be
better
than
other
people
society
could
be
carried
on
if
we
inquired
into
private
conduct
in
that
way
and
christianity
tells
us
to
think
no
evil
and
my
belief
is
that
miss
unit
had
no
cards
sent
her
but
the
results
we
know
were
not
of
a
kind
to
warrant
this
extenuation
of
the
past
maggie
had
returned
without
a
without
a
husband
in
that
degraded
and
outcast
condition
to
which
error
is
well
known
to
lead
and
the
world
wife
with
that
fine
instinct
which
is
given
her
for
the
preservation
of
society
saw
at
once
that
miss
tulliver
conduct
had
been
of
the
most
aggravated
kind
could
anything
be
more
detestable
a
girl
so
much
indebted
to
her
friends
whose
mother
as
well
as
herself
had
received
so
much
kindness
from
the
deanes
to
lay
the
design
of
winning
a
young
affections
away
from
her
own
cousin
who
had
behaved
like
a
sister
to
her
winning
his
affections
that
was
not
the
phrase
for
such
a
girl
as
miss
tulliver
it
would
have
been
more
correct
to
say
that
she
had
been
actuated
by
mere
unwomanly
boldness
and
unbridled
passion
there
was
always
something
questionable
about
her
that
connection
with
young
wakem
which
they
said
had
been
carried
on
for
years
looked
very
ill
disgusting
in
fact
but
with
a
girl
of
that
disposition
to
the
world
wife
there
had
always
been
something
in
miss
very
that
a
refined
instinct
felt
to
be
prophetic
of
harm
as
for
poor
stephen
guest
he
was
rather
pitiable
than
otherwise
a
young
man
of
is
not
to
be
too
severely
judged
in
these
cases
he
is
really
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
a
designing
bold
girl
and
it
was
clear
that
he
had
given
way
in
spite
of
himself
he
had
shaken
her
off
as
soon
as
he
could
indeed
their
having
parted
so
soon
looked
very
black
indeed
to
be
sure
he
had
written
a
letter
laying
all
the
blame
on
himself
and
telling
the
story
in
a
romantic
fashion
so
as
to
try
and
make
her
appear
quite
innocent
of
course
he
would
do
that
but
the
refined
instinct
of
the
world
wife
was
not
to
be
deceived
providentially
else
what
would
become
of
society
why
her
own
brother
had
turned
her
from
his
door
he
had
seen
enough
you
might
be
sure
before
he
would
do
that
a
truly
respectable
young
man
tom
tulliver
quite
likely
to
rise
in
the
world
his
sister
disgrace
was
naturally
a
heavy
blow
to
him
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
she
would
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
to
america
or
anywhere
so
as
to
purify
the
air
of
ogg
from
the
stain
of
her
presence
extremely
dangerous
to
daughters
there
no
good
could
happen
to
her
it
was
only
to
be
hoped
she
would
repent
and
that
god
would
have
mercy
on
her
he
had
not
the
care
of
society
on
his
hands
as
the
world
wife
had
it
required
nearly
a
fortnight
for
fine
instinct
to
assure
itself
of
these
inspirations
indeed
it
was
a
whole
week
before
letter
came
telling
his
father
the
facts
and
adding
that
he
was
gone
across
to
holland
had
drawn
upon
the
agent
at
mudport
for
money
was
incapable
of
any
resolution
at
present
maggie
all
this
while
was
too
entirely
filled
with
a
more
agonizing
anxiety
to
spend
any
thought
on
the
view
that
was
being
taken
of
her
conduct
by
the
world
of
ogg
anxiety
about
stephen
lucy
philip
beat
on
her
poor
heart
in
a
hard
driving
ceaseless
storm
of
mingled
love
remorse
and
pity
if
she
had
thought
of
rejection
and
injustice
at
all
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
done
their
worst
that
she
could
hardly
feel
any
stroke
from
them
intolerable
since
the
words
she
had
heard
from
her
brother
lips
across
all
her
anxiety
for
the
loved
and
the
injured
those
words
shot
again
and
again
like
a
horrible
pang
that
would
have
brought
misery
and
dread
even
into
a
heaven
of
delights
the
idea
of
ever
recovering
happiness
never
glimmered
in
her
mind
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
every
sensitive
fibre
in
her
were
too
entirely
preoccupied
by
pain
ever
to
vibrate
again
to
another
influence
life
stretched
before
her
as
one
act
of
penitence
and
all
she
craved
as
she
dwelt
on
her
future
lot
was
something
to
guarantee
her
from
more
falling
her
own
weakness
haunted
her
like
a
vision
of
hideous
possibilities
that
made
no
peace
conceivable
except
such
as
lay
in
the
sense
of
a
sure
refuge
but
she
was
not
without
practical
intentions
the
love
of
independence
was
too
strong
an
inheritance
and
a
habit
for
her
not
to
remember
that
she
must
get
her
bread
and
when
other
projects
looked
vague
she
fell
back
on
that
of
returning
to
her
plain
sewing
and
so
getting
enough
to
pay
for
her
lodging
at
bob
she
meant
to
persuade
her
mother
to
return
to
the
mill
by
and
by
and
live
with
tom
again
and
somehow
or
other
she
would
maintain
herself
at
ogg
kenn
would
perhaps
help
her
and
advise
her
she
remembered
his
parting
words
at
the
bazaar
she
remembered
the
momentary
feeling
of
reliance
that
had
sprung
in
her
when
he
was
talking
with
her
and
she
waited
with
yearning
expectation
for
the
opportunity
of
confiding
everything
to
him
her
mother
called
every
day
at
deane
to
learn
how
lucy
was
the
report
was
always
sad
nothing
had
yet
roused
her
from
the
feeble
passivity
which
had
come
on
with
the
first
shock
but
of
philip
tulliver
had
learned
nothing
naturally
no
one
whom
she
met
would
speak
to
her
about
what
related
to
her
daughter
but
at
last
she
summoned
courage
to
go
and
see
sister
glegg
who
of
course
would
know
everything
and
had
been
even
to
see
tom
at
the
mill
in
tulliver
absence
though
he
had
said
nothing
of
what
had
passed
on
the
occasion
as
soon
as
her
mother
was
gone
maggie
put
on
her
bonnet
she
had
resolved
on
walking
to
the
rectory
and
asking
to
see
kenn
he
was
in
deep
grief
but
the
grief
of
another
does
not
jar
upon
us
in
such
circumstances
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
beyond
the
door
since
her
return
nevertheless
her
mind
was
so
bent
on
the
purpose
of
her
walk
that
the
unpleasantness
of
meeting
people
on
the
way
and
being
stared
at
did
not
occur
to
her
but
she
had
no
sooner
passed
beyond
the
narrower
streets
which
she
had
to
thread
from
dwelling
than
she
became
aware
of
unusual
glances
cast
at
her
and
this
consciousness
made
her
hurry
along
nervously
afraid
to
look
to
right
or
left
presently
however
she
came
full
on
and
miss
turnbull
old
acquaintances
of
her
family
they
both
looked
at
her
strangely
and
turned
a
little
aside
without
speaking
all
hard
looks
were
pain
to
maggie
but
her
was
too
strong
for
resentment
no
wonder
they
will
not
speak
to
me
she
thought
they
are
very
fond
of
lucy
but
now
she
knew
that
she
was
about
to
pass
a
group
of
gentlemen
who
were
standing
at
the
door
of
the
and
she
could
not
help
seeing
young
torry
step
out
a
little
with
his
glass
at
his
eye
and
bow
to
her
with
that
air
of
which
he
might
have
bestowed
on
a
friendly
barmaid
maggie
pride
was
too
intense
for
her
not
to
feel
that
sting
even
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
and
for
the
first
time
the
thought
took
strong
hold
of
her
that
she
would
have
other
obloquy
cast
on
her
besides
that
which
was
felt
to
be
due
to
her
breach
of
faith
toward
lucy
but
she
was
at
the
rectory
now
there
perhaps
she
would
find
something
else
than
retribution
retribution
may
come
from
any
voice
the
hardest
cruelest
most
imbruted
urchin
at
the
can
inflict
it
surely
help
and
pity
are
rarer
things
more
needful
for
the
righteous
to
bestow
she
was
shown
up
at
once
after
being
announced
into
study
where
he
sat
amongst
books
for
which
he
had
little
appetite
leaning
his
cheek
against
the
head
of
his
youngest
child
a
girl
of
three
the
child
was
sent
away
with
the
servant
and
when
the
door
was
closed
kenn
said
placing
a
chair
for
maggie
i
was
coming
to
see
you
miss
tulliver
you
have
anticipated
me
i
am
glad
you
did
maggie
looked
at
him
with
her
childlike
directness
as
she
had
done
at
the
bazaar
and
said
i
want
to
tell
you
everything
but
her
eyes
filled
fast
with
tears
as
she
said
it
and
all
the
excitement
of
her
humiliating
walk
would
have
its
vent
before
she
could
say
more
do
tell
me
everything
kenn
said
with
quiet
kindness
in
his
grave
firm
voice
think
of
me
as
one
to
whom
a
long
experience
has
been
granted
which
may
enable
him
to
help
you
in
rather
broken
sentences
and
with
some
effort
at
first
but
soon
with
the
greater
ease
that
came
from
a
sense
of
relief
in
the
confidence
maggie
told
the
brief
story
of
a
struggle
that
must
be
the
beginning
of
a
long
sorrow
only
the
day
before
kenn
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
stephen
letter
and
he
had
believed
them
at
once
without
the
confirmation
of
maggie
statement
that
involuntary
plaint
of
hers
i
must
had
remained
with
him
as
the
sign
that
she
was
undergoing
some
inward
conflict
maggie
dwelt
the
longest
on
the
feeling
which
had
made
her
come
back
to
her
mother
and
brother
which
made
her
cling
to
all
the
memories
of
the
past
when
she
had
ended
kenn
was
silent
for
some
minutes
there
was
a
difficulty
on
his
mind
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hearth
with
his
hands
behind
him
at
last
he
seated
himself
again
and
said
looking
at
maggie
your
prompting
to
go
to
your
nearest
friends
to
remain
where
all
the
ties
of
your
life
have
been
formed
is
a
true
prompting
to
which
the
church
in
its
original
constitution
and
discipline
responds
opening
its
arms
to
the
penitent
watching
over
its
children
to
the
last
never
abandoning
them
until
they
are
hopelessly
reprobate
and
the
church
ought
to
represent
the
feeling
of
the
community
so
that
every
parish
should
be
a
family
knit
together
by
christian
brotherhood
under
a
spiritual
father
but
the
ideas
of
discipline
and
christian
fraternity
are
entirely
relaxed
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
exist
in
the
public
mind
they
hardly
survive
except
in
the
partial
contradictory
form
they
have
taken
in
the
narrow
communities
of
schismatics
and
if
i
were
not
supported
by
the
firm
faith
that
the
church
must
ultimately
recover
the
full
force
of
that
constitution
which
is
alone
fitted
to
human
needs
i
should
often
lose
heart
at
observing
the
want
of
fellowship
and
sense
of
mutual
responsibility
among
my
own
flock
at
present
everything
seems
tending
toward
the
relaxation
of
ties
toward
the
substitution
of
wayward
choice
for
the
adherence
to
obligation
which
has
its
roots
in
the
past
your
conscience
and
your
heart
have
given
you
true
light
on
this
point
miss
tulliver
and
i
have
said
all
this
that
you
may
know
what
my
wish
about
you
what
my
advice
to
you
would
be
if
they
sprang
from
my
own
feeling
and
opinion
unmodified
by
counteracting
circumstances
kenn
paused
a
little
while
there
was
an
entire
absence
of
effusive
benevolence
in
his
manner
there
was
something
almost
cold
in
the
gravity
of
his
look
and
voice
if
maggie
had
not
known
that
his
benevolence
was
persevering
in
proportion
to
its
reserve
she
might
have
been
chilled
and
frightened
as
it
was
she
listened
expectantly
quite
sure
that
there
would
be
some
effective
help
in
his
words
he
went
on
your
inexperience
of
the
world
miss
tulliver
prevents
you
from
anticipating
fully
the
very
unjust
conceptions
that
will
probably
be
formed
concerning
your
conduct
conceptions
which
will
have
a
baneful
effect
even
in
spite
of
known
evidence
to
disprove
them
oh
i
do
i
begin
to
see
said
maggie
unable
to
repress
this
utterance
of
her
recent
pain
i
know
i
shall
be
insulted
i
shall
be
thought
worse
than
i
am
you
perhaps
do
not
yet
know
said
kenn
with
a
touch
of
more
personal
pity
that
a
letter
is
come
which
ought
to
satisfy
every
one
who
has
known
anything
of
you
that
you
chose
the
steep
and
difficult
path
of
a
return
to
the
right
at
the
moment
when
that
return
was
most
of
all
difficult
oh
where
is
he
said
poor
maggie
with
a
flush
and
tremor
that
no
presence
could
have
hindered
he
is
gone
abroad
he
has
written
of
all
that
passed
to
his
father
he
has
vindicated
you
to
the
utmost
and
i
hope
the
communication
of
that
letter
to
your
cousin
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
on
her
kenn
waited
for
her
to
get
calm
again
before
he
went
on
that
letter
as
i
said
ought
to
suffice
to
prevent
false
impressions
concerning
you
but
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
miss
tulliver
that
not
only
the
experience
of
my
whole
life
but
my
observation
within
the
last
three
days
makes
me
fear
that
there
is
hardly
any
evidence
which
will
save
you
from
the
painful
effect
of
false
imputations
the
persons
who
are
the
most
incapable
of
a
conscientious
struggle
such
as
yours
are
precisely
those
who
will
be
likely
to
shrink
from
you
because
they
will
not
believe
in
your
struggle
i
fear
your
life
here
will
be
attended
not
only
with
much
pain
but
with
many
obstructions
for
this
reason
and
for
this
only
i
ask
you
to
consider
whether
it
will
not
perhaps
be
better
for
you
to
take
a
situation
at
a
distance
according
to
your
former
intention
i
will
exert
myself
at
once
to
obtain
one
for
you
oh
if
i
could
but
stop
here
said
maggie
i
have
no
heart
to
begin
a
strange
life
again
i
should
have
no
stay
i
should
feel
like
a
lonely
wanderer
cut
off
from
the
past
i
have
written
to
the
lady
who
offered
me
a
situation
to
excuse
myself
if
i
remained
here
i
could
perhaps
atone
in
some
way
to
lucy
to
others
i
could
convince
them
that
i
sorry
and
she
added
with
some
of
the
old
proud
fire
flashing
out
i
will
not
go
away
because
people
say
false
things
of
me
they
shall
learn
to
retract
them
if
i
must
go
away
at
last
because
because
others
wish
it
i
will
not
go
now
well
said
kenn
after
some
consideration
if
you
determine
on
that
miss
tulliver
you
may
rely
on
all
the
influence
my
position
gives
me
i
am
bound
to
aid
and
countenance
you
by
the
very
duties
of
my
office
as
a
parish
priest
i
will
add
that
personally
i
have
a
deep
interest
in
your
peace
of
mind
and
welfare
the
only
thing
i
want
is
some
occupation
that
will
enable
me
to
get
my
bread
and
be
independent
said
maggie
i
shall
not
want
much
i
can
go
on
lodging
where
i
am
i
must
think
over
the
subject
maturely
said
kenn
and
in
a
few
days
i
shall
be
better
able
to
ascertain
the
general
feeling
i
shall
come
to
see
you
i
shall
bear
you
constantly
in
mind
when
maggie
had
left
him
kenn
stood
ruminating
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
carpet
under
a
painful
sense
of
doubt
and
difficulty
the
tone
of
stephen
letter
which
he
had
read
and
the
actual
relations
of
all
the
persons
concerned
forced
upon
him
powerfully
the
idea
of
an
ultimate
marriage
between
stephen
and
maggie
as
the
least
evil
and
the
impossibility
of
their
proximity
in
ogg
on
any
other
supposition
until
after
years
of
separation
threw
an
insurmountable
prospective
difficulty
over
maggie
stay
there
on
the
other
hand
he
entered
with
all
the
comprehension
of
a
man
who
had
known
spiritual
conflict
and
lived
through
years
of
devoted
service
to
his
into
that
state
of
maggie
heart
and
conscience
which
made
the
consent
to
the
marriage
a
desecration
to
her
her
conscience
must
not
be
tampered
with
the
principle
on
which
she
had
acted
was
a
safer
guide
than
any
balancing
of
consequences
his
experience
told
him
that
intervention
was
too
dubious
a
responsibility
to
be
lightly
incurred
the
possible
issue
either
of
an
endeavor
to
restore
the
former
relations
with
lucy
and
philip
or
of
counselling
submission
to
this
irruption
of
a
new
feeling
was
hidden
in
a
darkness
all
the
more
impenetrable
because
each
immediate
step
was
clogged
with
evil
the
great
problem
of
the
shifting
relation
between
passion
and
duty
is
clear
to
no
man
who
is
capable
of
apprehending
it
the
question
whether
the
moment
has
come
in
which
a
man
has
fallen
below
the
possibility
of
a
renunciation
that
will
carry
any
efficacy
and
must
accept
the
sway
of
a
passion
against
which
he
had
struggled
as
a
trespass
is
one
for
which
we
have
no
that
will
fit
all
cases
the
casuists
have
become
a
byword
of
reproach
but
their
perverted
spirit
of
minute
discrimination
was
the
shadow
of
a
truth
to
which
eyes
and
hearts
are
too
often
fatally
sealed
the
truth
that
moral
judgments
must
remain
false
and
hollow
unless
they
are
checked
and
enlightened
by
a
perpetual
reference
to
the
special
circumstances
that
mark
the
individual
lot
all
people
of
broad
strong
sense
have
an
instinctive
repugnance
to
the
men
of
maxims
because
such
people
early
discern
that
the
mysterious
complexity
of
our
life
is
not
to
be
embraced
by
maxims
and
that
to
lace
ourselves
up
in
formulas
of
that
sort
is
to
repress
all
the
divine
promptings
and
inspirations
that
spring
from
growing
insight
and
sympathy
and
the
man
of
maxims
is
the
popular
representative
of
the
minds
that
are
guided
in
their
moral
judgment
solely
by
general
rules
thinking
that
these
will
lead
them
to
justice
by
a
patent
method
without
the
trouble
of
exerting
patience
discrimination
impartiality
without
any
care
to
assure
themselves
whether
they
have
the
insight
that
comes
from
a
hardly
earned
estimate
of
temptation
or
from
a
life
vivid
and
intense
enough
to
have
created
a
wide
with
all
that
is
human
chapter
iii
showing
that
old
acquaintances
are
capable
of
surprising
us
when
maggie
was
at
home
again
her
mother
brought
her
news
of
an
unexpected
line
of
conduct
in
aunt
glegg
as
long
as
maggie
had
not
been
heard
of
glegg
had
half
closed
her
shutters
and
drawn
down
her
blinds
she
felt
assured
that
maggie
was
drowned
that
was
far
more
probable
than
that
her
niece
and
legatee
should
have
done
anything
to
wound
the
family
honor
in
the
tenderest
point
when
at
last
she
learned
from
tom
that
maggie
had
come
home
and
gathered
from
him
what
was
her
explanation
of
her
absence
she
burst
forth
in
severe
reproof
of
tom
for
admitting
the
worst
of
his
sister
until
he
was
compelled
if
you
were
not
to
stand
by
your
kin
as
long
as
there
was
a
shred
of
honor
attributable
to
them
pray
what
were
you
to
stand
by
lightly
to
admit
conduct
in
one
of
your
own
family
that
would
force
you
to
alter
your
will
had
never
been
the
way
of
the
dodsons
and
though
glegg
had
always
augured
ill
of
maggie
future
at
a
time
when
other
people
were
perhaps
less
yet
fair
play
was
a
jewel
and
it
was
not
for
her
own
friends
to
help
to
rob
the
girl
of
her
fair
fame
and
to
cast
her
out
from
family
shelter
to
the
scorn
of
the
outer
world
until
she
had
become
unequivocally
a
family
disgrace
the
circumstances
were
unprecedented
in
glegg
experience
nothing
of
that
kind
had
happened
among
the
dodsons
before
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
her
hereditary
rectitude
and
personal
strength
of
character
found
a
common
channel
along
with
her
fundamental
ideas
of
clanship
as
they
did
in
her
lifelong
regard
to
equity
in
money
matters
she
quarrelled
with
glegg
whose
kindness
flowing
entirely
into
compassion
for
lucy
made
him
as
hard
in
his
judgment
of
maggie
as
deane
himself
was
and
fuming
against
her
sister
tulliver
because
she
did
not
at
once
come
to
her
for
advice
and
help
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
room
with
baxter
saints
rest
from
morning
till
night
denying
herself
to
all
visitors
till
glegg
brought
from
deane
the
news
of
stephen
letter
then
glegg
felt
that
she
had
adequate
then
she
laid
aside
baxter
and
was
ready
to
meet
all
comers
while
pullet
could
do
nothing
but
shake
her
head
and
cry
and
wish
that
cousin
abbot
had
died
or
any
number
of
funerals
had
happened
rather
than
this
which
had
never
happened
before
so
that
there
was
no
knowing
how
to
act
and
pullet
could
never
enter
ogg
again
because
acquaintances
knew
of
it
all
glegg
only
hoped
that
wooll
or
any
one
else
would
come
to
her
with
their
false
tales
about
her
own
niece
and
she
would
know
what
to
say
to
that
person
again
she
had
a
scene
of
remonstrance
with
tom
all
the
more
severe
in
proportion
to
the
greater
strength
of
her
present
position
but
tom
like
other
immovable
things
seemed
only
the
more
rigidly
fixed
under
that
attempt
to
shake
him
poor
tom
he
judged
by
what
he
had
been
able
to
see
and
the
judgment
was
painful
enough
to
himself
he
thought
he
had
the
demonstration
of
facts
observed
through
years
by
his
own
eyes
which
gave
no
warning
of
their
imperfection
that
maggie
nature
was
utterly
untrustworthy
and
too
strongly
marked
with
evil
tendencies
to
be
safely
treated
with
leniency
he
would
act
on
that
demonstration
at
any
cost
but
the
thought
of
it
made
his
days
bitter
to
him
tom
like
every
one
of
us
was
imprisoned
within
the
limits
of
his
own
nature
and
his
education
had
simply
glided
over
him
leaving
a
slight
deposit
of
polish
if
you
are
inclined
to
be
severe
on
his
severity
remember
that
the
responsibility
of
tolerance
lies
with
those
who
have
the
wider
vision
there
had
arisen
in
tom
a
repulsion
toward
maggie
that
derived
its
very
intensity
from
their
early
childish
love
in
the
time
when
they
had
clasped
tiny
fingers
together
and
their
later
sense
of
nearness
in
a
common
duty
and
a
common
sorrow
the
sight
of
her
as
he
had
told
her
was
hateful
to
him
in
this
branch
of
the
dodson
family
aunt
glegg
found
a
stronger
nature
than
her
own
a
nature
in
which
family
feeling
had
lost
the
character
of
clanship
by
taking
on
a
doubly
deep
dye
of
personal
pride
glegg
allowed
that
maggie
ought
to
be
punished
she
was
not
a
woman
to
deny
that
she
knew
what
conduct
was
but
punished
in
proportion
to
the
misdeeds
proved
against
her
not
to
those
which
were
cast
upon
her
by
people
outside
her
own
family
who
might
wish
to
show
that
their
own
kin
were
better
your
aunt
glegg
scolded
me
so
as
niver
was
my
dear
said
poor
tulliver
when
she
came
back
to
maggie
as
i
did
go
to
her
before
she
said
it
was
for
her
to
come
to
me
first
but
she
spoke
like
a
sister
too
she
allays
was
and
hard
to
please
oh
dear
but
she
said
the
kindest
word
as
has
ever
been
spoke
by
you
yet
my
child
for
she
says
for
all
she
been
so
set
again
having
one
extry
in
the
house
and
making
extry
spoons
and
things
and
putting
her
about
in
her
ways
you
shall
have
a
shelter
in
her
house
if
you
go
to
her
dutiful
and
she
uphold
you
against
folks
as
say
harm
of
you
when
they
no
call
and
i
told
her
i
thought
you
could
bear
to
see
anybody
but
me
you
were
so
beat
down
with
trouble
but
she
said
wo
throw
ill
words
at
her
there
them
out
o
th
family
be
ready
enough
to
do
that
but
i
give
her
good
advice
an
she
must
be
humble
it
wonderful
o
jane
for
sure
she
used
to
throw
everything
i
did
wrong
at
me
if
it
was
the
as
turned
out
bad
or
the
pies
too
hot
or
whativer
it
was
oh
mother
said
poor
maggie
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
all
the
contact
her
bruised
mind
would
have
to
bear
tell
her
i
very
grateful
i
go
to
see
her
as
soon
as
i
can
but
i
ca
see
any
one
just
yet
except
kenn
i
been
to
him
he
will
advise
me
and
help
me
to
get
some
occupation
i
ca
live
with
any
one
or
be
dependent
on
them
tell
aunt
glegg
i
must
get
my
own
bread
but
did
you
hear
nothing
of
philip
philip
wakem
have
you
never
seen
any
one
that
has
mentioned
him
no
my
dear
but
i
been
to
lucy
and
i
saw
your
uncle
and
he
says
they
got
her
to
listen
to
the
letter
and
she
took
notice
o
miss
guest
and
asked
questions
and
the
doctor
thinks
she
on
the
turn
to
be
better
what
a
world
this
is
what
trouble
oh
dear
the
law
was
the
first
beginning
and
it
gone
from
bad
to
worse
all
of
a
sudden
just
when
the
luck
seemed
on
the
turn
this
was
the
first
lamentation
that
tulliver
had
let
slip
to
maggie
but
old
habit
had
been
revived
by
the
interview
with
sister
glegg
my
poor
poor
mother
maggie
burst
out
cut
to
the
heart
with
pity
and
compunction
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
i
was
always
naughty
and
troublesome
to
you
and
now
you
might
have
been
happy
if
it
had
been
for
me
eh
my
dear
said
tulliver
leaning
toward
the
warm
young
cheek
i
must
put
up
wi
my
children
i
shall
never
have
no
more
and
if
they
bring
me
bad
luck
i
must
be
fond
on
it
there
nothing
else
much
to
be
fond
on
for
my
furnitur
went
long
ago
and
you
got
to
be
very
good
once
i
ca
think
how
it
turned
out
the
wrong
way
so
still
two
or
three
more
days
passed
and
maggie
heard
nothing
of
philip
anxiety
about
him
was
becoming
her
predominant
trouble
and
she
summoned
courage
at
last
to
inquire
about
him
of
kenn
on
his
next
visit
to
her
he
did
not
even
know
if
philip
was
at
home
the
elder
wakem
was
made
moody
by
an
accumulation
of
annoyance
the
disappointment
in
this
young
jetsome
to
whom
apparently
he
was
a
good
deal
attached
had
been
followed
close
by
the
catastrophe
to
his
son
hopes
after
he
had
done
violence
to
his
own
strong
feeling
by
conceding
to
them
and
had
incautiously
mentioned
this
concession
in
ogg
and
he
was
almost
fierce
in
his
brusqueness
when
any
one
asked
him
a
question
about
his
son
but
philip
could
hardly
have
been
ill
or
it
would
have
been
known
through
the
calling
in
of
the
medical
man
it
was
probable
that
he
was
gone
out
of
the
town
for
a
little
while
maggie
sickened
under
this
suspense
and
her
imagination
began
to
live
more
and
more
persistently
in
what
philip
was
enduring
what
did
he
believe
about
her
at
last
bob
brought
her
a
letter
without
a
postmark
directed
in
a
hand
which
she
knew
familiarly
in
the
letters
of
her
own
name
a
hand
in
which
her
name
had
been
written
long
ago
in
a
pocket
shakespeare
which
she
possessed
her
mother
was
in
the
room
and
maggie
in
violent
agitation
hurried
upstairs
that
she
might
read
the
letter
in
solitude
she
read
it
with
a
throbbing
brow
maggie
i
believe
in
you
i
know
you
never
meant
to
deceive
me
i
know
you
tried
to
keep
faith
to
me
and
to
all
i
believed
this
before
i
had
any
other
evidence
of
it
than
your
own
nature
the
night
after
i
last
parted
from
you
i
suffered
torments
i
had
seen
what
convinced
me
that
you
were
not
free
that
there
was
another
whose
presence
had
a
power
over
you
which
mine
never
possessed
but
through
all
the
suggestions
almost
murderous
suggestions
of
rage
and
jealousy
my
mind
made
its
way
to
believe
in
your
truthfulness
i
was
sure
that
you
meant
to
cleave
to
me
as
you
had
said
that
you
had
rejected
him
that
you
struggled
to
renounce
him
for
lucy
sake
and
for
mine
but
i
could
see
no
issue
that
was
not
fatal
for
and
that
dread
shut
out
the
very
thought
of
resignation
i
foresaw
that
he
would
not
relinquish
you
and
i
believed
then
as
i
believe
now
that
the
strong
attraction
which
drew
you
together
proceeded
only
from
one
side
of
your
characters
and
belonged
to
that
partial
divided
action
of
our
nature
which
makes
half
the
tragedy
of
the
human
lot
i
have
felt
the
vibration
of
chords
in
your
nature
that
i
have
continually
felt
the
want
of
in
his
but
perhaps
i
am
wrong
perhaps
i
feel
about
you
as
the
artist
does
about
the
scene
over
which
his
soul
has
brooded
with
love
he
would
tremble
to
see
it
confided
to
other
hands
he
would
never
believe
that
it
could
bear
for
another
all
the
meaning
and
the
beauty
it
bears
for
him
i
dared
not
trust
myself
to
see
you
that
morning
i
was
filled
with
selfish
passion
i
was
shattered
by
a
night
of
conscious
delirium
i
told
you
long
ago
that
i
had
never
been
resigned
even
to
the
mediocrity
of
my
powers
how
could
i
be
resigned
to
the
loss
of
the
one
thing
which
had
ever
come
to
me
on
earth
with
the
promise
of
such
deep
joy
as
would
give
a
new
and
blessed
meaning
to
the
foregoing
pain
the
promise
of
another
self
that
would
lift
my
aching
affection
into
the
divine
rapture
of
an
want
but
the
miseries
of
that
night
had
prepared
me
for
what
came
before
the
next
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
i
was
certain
that
he
had
prevailed
on
you
to
sacrifice
everything
to
him
and
i
waited
with
equal
certainty
to
hear
of
your
marriage
i
measured
your
love
and
his
by
my
own
but
i
was
wrong
maggie
there
is
something
stronger
in
you
than
your
love
for
him
i
will
not
tell
you
what
i
went
through
in
that
interval
but
even
in
its
utmost
agony
even
in
those
terrible
throes
that
love
must
suffer
before
it
can
be
disembodied
of
selfish
desire
my
love
for
you
sufficed
to
withhold
me
from
suicide
without
the
aid
of
any
other
motive
in
the
midst
of
my
egoism
i
yet
could
not
bear
to
come
like
a
across
the
feast
of
your
joy
i
could
not
bear
to
forsake
the
world
in
which
you
still
lived
and
might
need
me
it
was
part
of
the
faith
i
had
vowed
to
you
to
wait
and
endure
maggie
that
is
a
proof
of
what
i
write
now
to
assure
you
of
that
no
anguish
i
have
had
to
bear
on
your
account
has
been
too
heavy
a
price
to
pay
for
the
new
life
into
which
i
have
entered
in
loving
you
i
want
you
to
put
aside
all
grief
because
of
the
grief
you
have
caused
me
i
was
nurtured
in
the
sense
of
privation
i
never
expected
happiness
and
in
knowing
you
in
loving
you
i
have
had
and
still
have
what
reconciles
me
to
life
you
have
been
to
my
affections
what
light
what
color
is
to
my
eyes
what
music
is
to
the
inward
ear
you
have
raised
a
dim
unrest
into
a
vivid
consciousness
the
new
life
i
have
found
in
caring
for
your
joy
and
sorrow
more
than
for
what
is
directly
my
own
has
transformed
the
spirit
of
rebellious
murmuring
into
that
willing
endurance
which
is
the
birth
of
strong
sympathy
i
think
nothing
but
such
complete
and
intense
love
could
have
initiated
me
into
that
enlarged
life
which
grows
and
grows
by
appropriating
the
life
of
others
for
before
i
was
always
dragged
back
from
it
by
painful
i
even
think
sometimes
that
this
gift
of
transferred
life
which
has
come
to
me
in
loving
you
may
be
a
new
power
to
me
then
dear
one
in
spite
of
all
you
have
been
the
blessing
of
my
life
let
no
weigh
on
you
because
of
me
it
is
i
who
should
rather
reproach
myself
for
having
urged
my
feelings
upon
you
and
hurried
you
into
words
that
you
have
felt
as
fetters
you
meant
to
be
true
to
those
words
you
been
true
i
can
measure
your
sacrifice
by
what
i
have
known
in
only
one
of
your
presence
with
me
when
i
dreamed
that
you
might
love
me
best
but
maggie
i
have
no
just
claim
on
you
for
more
than
affectionate
remembrance
for
some
time
i
have
shrunk
from
writing
to
you
because
i
have
shrunk
even
from
the
appearance
of
wishing
to
thrust
myself
before
you
and
so
repeating
my
original
error
but
you
will
not
misconstrue
me
i
know
that
we
must
keep
apart
for
a
long
while
cruel
tongues
would
force
us
apart
if
nothing
else
did
but
i
shall
not
go
away
the
place
where
you
are
is
the
one
where
my
mind
must
live
wherever
i
might
travel
and
remember
that
i
am
unchangeably
yours
yours
not
with
selfish
wishes
but
with
a
devotion
that
excludes
such
wishes
god
comfort
you
my
loving
maggie
if
every
one
else
has
misconceived
you
remember
that
you
have
never
been
doubted
by
him
whose
heart
recognized
you
ten
years
ago
do
not
believe
any
one
who
says
i
am
ill
because
i
am
not
seen
out
of
doors
i
have
only
had
nervous
headaches
no
worse
than
i
have
sometimes
had
them
before
but
the
overpowering
heat
inclines
me
to
be
perfectly
quiescent
in
the
daytime
i
am
strong
enough
to
obey
any
word
which
shall
tell
me
that
i
can
serve
you
by
word
or
deed
yours
to
the
last
as
maggie
knelt
by
the
bed
sobbing
with
that
letter
pressed
under
her
her
feelings
again
and
again
gathered
themselves
in
a
whispered
cry
always
in
the
same
words
o
god
is
there
any
happiness
in
love
that
could
make
me
forget
pain
chapter
iv
maggie
and
lucy
by
the
end
of
the
week
kenn
had
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
he
could
secure
to
maggie
a
suitable
living
at
ogg
even
with
his
twenty
years
experience
as
a
parish
priest
he
was
aghast
at
the
obstinate
continuance
of
imputations
against
her
in
the
face
of
evidence
hitherto
he
had
been
rather
more
adored
and
appealed
to
than
was
quite
agreeable
to
him
but
now
in
attempting
to
open
the
ears
of
women
to
reason
and
their
consciences
to
justice
on
behalf
of
maggie
tulliver
he
suddenly
found
himself
as
powerless
as
he
was
aware
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
attempted
to
influence
the
shape
of
bonnets
kenn
could
not
be
contradicted
he
was
listened
to
in
silence
but
when
he
left
the
room
a
comparison
of
opinions
among
his
hearers
yielded
much
the
same
result
as
before
miss
tulliver
had
undeniably
acted
in
a
blamable
manner
even
kenn
did
not
deny
that
how
then
could
he
think
so
lightly
of
her
as
to
put
that
favorable
interpretation
on
everything
she
had
done
even
on
the
supposition
that
required
the
utmost
stretch
of
belief
namely
that
none
of
the
things
said
about
miss
tulliver
were
true
still
since
they
been
said
about
her
they
had
cast
an
odor
round
her
which
must
cause
her
to
be
shrunk
from
by
every
woman
who
had
to
take
care
of
her
own
reputation
and
of
society
to
have
taken
maggie
by
the
hand
and
said
i
will
not
believe
unproved
evil
of
you
my
lips
shall
not
utter
it
my
ears
shall
be
closed
against
it
i
too
am
an
erring
mortal
liable
to
stumble
apt
to
come
short
of
my
most
earnest
efforts
your
lot
has
been
harder
than
mine
your
temptation
greater
let
us
help
each
other
to
stand
and
walk
without
more
falling
to
have
done
this
would
have
demanded
courage
deep
pity
generous
trust
would
have
demanded
a
mind
that
tasted
no
piquancy
in
that
felt
no
in
condemning
that
cheated
itself
with
no
large
words
into
the
belief
that
life
can
have
any
moral
end
any
high
religion
which
excludes
the
striving
after
perfect
truth
justice
and
love
toward
the
individual
men
and
women
who
come
across
our
own
path
the
ladies
of
ogg
were
not
beguiled
by
any
wide
speculative
conceptions
but
they
had
their
favorite
abstraction
called
society
which
served
to
make
their
consciences
perfectly
easy
in
doing
what
satisfied
their
own
egoism
thinking
and
speaking
the
worst
of
maggie
tulliver
and
turning
their
backs
upon
her
it
was
naturally
disappointing
to
kenn
after
two
years
of
superfluous
incense
from
his
feminine
parishioners
to
find
them
suddenly
maintaining
their
views
in
opposition
to
his
but
then
they
maintained
them
in
opposition
to
a
higher
authority
which
they
had
venerated
longer
that
authority
had
furnished
a
very
explicit
answer
to
persons
who
might
inquire
where
their
social
duties
began
and
might
be
inclined
to
take
wide
views
as
to
the
the
answer
had
not
turned
on
the
ultimate
good
of
society
but
on
a
certain
man
who
was
found
in
trouble
by
the
wayside
not
that
ogg
was
empty
of
women
with
some
tenderness
of
heart
and
conscience
probably
it
had
as
fair
a
proportion
of
human
goodness
in
it
as
any
other
small
trading
town
of
that
day
but
until
every
good
man
is
brave
we
must
expect
to
find
many
good
women
timid
too
timid
even
to
believe
in
the
correctness
of
their
own
best
promptings
when
these
would
place
them
in
a
minority
and
the
men
at
were
not
all
brave
by
any
means
some
of
them
were
even
fond
of
scandal
and
to
an
extent
that
might
have
given
their
conversation
an
effeminate
character
if
it
had
not
been
distinguished
by
masculine
jokes
and
by
an
occasional
shrug
of
the
shoulders
at
the
mutual
hatred
of
women
it
was
the
general
feeling
of
the
masculine
mind
at
ogg
that
women
were
not
to
be
interfered
with
in
their
treatment
of
each
other
and
thus
every
direction
in
which
kenn
had
turned
in
the
hope
of
procuring
some
kind
recognition
and
some
employment
for
maggie
proved
a
disappointment
to
him
james
torry
could
not
think
of
taking
maggie
as
a
nursery
governess
even
temporarily
a
young
woman
about
whom
such
things
had
been
said
and
about
whom
gentlemen
joked
and
miss
kirke
who
had
a
spinal
complaint
and
wanted
a
reader
and
companion
felt
quite
sure
that
maggie
mind
must
be
of
a
quality
with
which
she
for
her
part
could
not
risk
contact
why
did
not
miss
tulliver
accept
the
shelter
offered
her
by
her
aunt
glegg
it
did
not
become
a
girl
like
her
to
refuse
it
or
else
why
did
she
not
go
out
of
the
neighborhood
and
get
a
situation
where
she
was
not
known
it
was
not
apparently
of
so
much
importance
that
she
should
carry
her
dangerous
tendencies
into
strange
families
unknown
at
st
ogg
she
must
be
very
bold
and
hardened
to
wish
to
stay
in
a
parish
where
she
was
so
much
stared
at
and
whispered
about
kenn
having
great
natural
firmness
began
in
the
presence
of
this
opposition
as
every
firm
man
would
have
done
to
contract
a
certain
strength
of
determination
over
and
above
what
would
have
been
called
forth
by
the
end
in
view
he
himself
wanted
a
daily
governess
for
his
younger
children
and
though
he
had
hesitated
in
the
first
instance
to
offer
this
position
to
maggie
the
resolution
to
protest
with
the
utmost
force
of
his
personal
and
priestly
character
against
her
being
crushed
and
driven
away
by
slander
was
now
decisive
maggie
gratefully
accepted
an
employment
that
gave
her
duties
as
well
as
a
support
her
days
would
be
filled
now
and
solitary
evenings
would
be
a
welcome
rest
she
no
longer
needed
the
sacrifice
her
mother
made
in
staying
with
her
and
tulliver
was
persuaded
to
go
back
to
the
mill
but
now
it
began
to
be
discovered
that
kenn
exemplary
as
he
had
hitherto
appeared
had
his
crotchets
possibly
his
weaknesses
the
masculine
mind
of
ogg
smiled
pleasantly
and
did
not
wonder
that
kenn
liked
to
see
a
fine
pair
of
eyes
daily
or
that
he
was
inclined
to
take
so
lenient
a
view
of
the
past
the
feminine
mind
regarded
at
that
period
as
less
powerful
took
a
more
melancholy
view
of
the
case
if
kenn
should
be
beguiled
into
marrying
that
miss
tulliver
it
was
not
safe
to
be
too
confident
even
about
the
best
of
men
an
apostle
had
fallen
and
wept
bitterly
afterwards
and
though
denial
was
not
a
close
precedent
his
repentance
was
likely
to
be
maggie
had
not
taken
her
daily
walks
to
the
rectory
for
many
weeks
before
the
dreadful
possibility
of
her
some
time
or
other
becoming
the
rector
wife
had
been
talked
of
so
often
in
confidence
that
ladies
were
beginning
to
discuss
how
they
should
behave
to
her
in
that
position
for
kenn
it
had
been
understood
had
sat
in
the
schoolroom
half
an
hour
one
morning
when
miss
tulliver
was
giving
her
lessons
nay
he
had
sat
there
every
morning
he
had
once
walked
home
with
her
he
almost
walked
home
with
her
and
if
not
he
went
to
see
her
in
the
evening
what
an
artful
creature
she
was
what
a
for
those
children
it
was
enough
to
make
poor
kenn
turn
in
her
grave
that
they
should
be
put
under
the
care
of
this
girl
only
a
few
weeks
after
her
death
would
he
be
so
lost
to
propriety
as
to
marry
her
before
the
year
was
out
the
masculine
mind
was
sarcastic
and
thought
the
miss
guests
saw
an
alleviation
to
the
sorrow
of
witnessing
a
folly
in
their
rector
at
least
their
brother
would
be
safe
and
their
knowledge
of
stephen
tenacity
was
a
constant
ground
of
alarm
to
them
lest
he
should
come
back
and
marry
maggie
they
were
not
among
those
who
disbelieved
their
brother
letter
but
they
had
no
confidence
in
maggie
adherence
to
her
renunciation
of
him
they
suspected
that
she
had
shrunk
rather
from
the
elopement
than
from
the
marriage
and
that
she
lingered
in
ogg
relying
on
his
return
to
her
they
had
always
thought
her
disagreeable
they
now
thought
her
artful
and
proud
having
quite
as
good
grounds
for
that
judgment
as
you
and
i
probably
have
for
many
strong
opinions
of
the
same
kind
formerly
they
had
not
altogether
delighted
in
the
contemplated
match
with
lucy
but
now
their
dread
of
a
marriage
between
stephen
and
maggie
added
its
momentum
to
their
genuine
pity
and
indignation
on
behalf
of
the
gentle
forsaken
girl
in
making
them
desire
that
he
should
return
to
her
as
soon
as
lucy
was
able
to
leave
home
she
was
to
seek
relief
from
the
oppressive
heat
of
this
august
by
going
to
the
coast
with
the
miss
guests
and
it
was
in
their
plans
that
stephen
should
be
induced
to
join
them
on
the
very
first
hint
of
gossip
concerning
maggie
and
kenn
the
report
was
conveyed
in
miss
guest
letter
to
her
brother
maggie
had
frequent
tidings
through
her
mother
or
aunt
glegg
or
kenn
of
lucy
gradual
progress
toward
recovery
and
her
thoughts
tended
continually
toward
her
uncle
deane
house
she
hungered
for
an
interview
with
lucy
if
it
were
only
for
five
minutes
to
utter
a
word
of
penitence
to
be
assured
by
lucy
own
eyes
and
lips
that
she
did
not
believe
in
the
willing
treachery
of
those
whom
she
had
loved
and
trusted
but
she
knew
that
even
if
her
uncle
indignation
had
not
closed
his
house
against
her
the
agitation
of
such
an
interview
would
have
been
forbidden
to
lucy
only
to
have
seen
her
without
speaking
would
have
been
some
relief
for
maggie
was
haunted
by
a
face
cruel
in
its
very
gentleness
a
face
that
had
been
turned
on
hers
with
glad
sweet
looks
of
trust
and
love
from
the
twilight
time
of
memory
changed
now
to
a
sad
and
weary
face
by
a
first
and
as
the
days
passed
on
that
pale
image
became
more
and
more
distinct
the
picture
grew
and
grew
into
more
speaking
definiteness
under
the
avenging
hand
of
remorse
the
soft
hazel
eyes
in
their
look
of
pain
were
bent
forever
on
maggie
and
pierced
her
the
more
because
she
could
see
no
anger
in
them
but
lucy
was
not
yet
able
to
go
to
church
or
any
place
where
maggie
could
see
her
and
even
the
hope
of
that
departed
when
the
news
was
told
her
by
aunt
glegg
that
lucy
was
really
going
away
in
a
few
days
to
scarborough
with
the
miss
guests
who
had
been
heard
to
say
that
they
expected
their
brother
to
meet
them
there
only
those
who
have
known
what
hardest
inward
conflict
is
can
know
what
maggie
felt
as
she
sat
in
her
loneliness
the
evening
after
hearing
that
news
from
glegg
only
those
who
have
known
what
it
is
to
dread
their
own
selfish
desires
as
the
watching
mother
would
dread
the
that
was
to
still
her
own
pain
she
sat
without
candle
in
the
twilight
with
the
window
wide
open
toward
the
river
the
sense
of
oppressive
heat
adding
itself
undistinguishably
to
the
burthen
of
her
lot
seated
on
a
chair
against
the
window
with
her
arm
on
the
windowsill
she
was
looking
blankly
at
the
flowing
river
swift
with
the
tide
struggling
to
see
still
the
sweet
face
in
its
unreproaching
sadness
that
seemed
now
from
moment
to
moment
to
sink
away
and
be
hidden
behind
a
form
that
thrust
itself
between
and
made
darkness
hearing
the
door
open
she
thought
jakin
was
coming
in
with
her
supper
as
usual
and
with
that
repugnance
to
trivial
speech
which
comes
with
languor
and
wretchedness
she
shrank
from
turning
round
and
saying
she
wanted
nothing
good
little
jakin
would
be
sure
to
make
some
remarks
but
the
next
moment
without
her
having
discerned
the
sound
of
a
footstep
she
felt
a
light
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
heard
a
voice
close
to
her
saying
maggie
the
face
was
there
changed
but
all
the
sweeter
the
hazel
eyes
were
there
with
their
tenderness
maggie
the
soft
voice
said
lucy
answered
a
voice
with
a
sharp
ring
of
anguish
in
it
and
lucy
threw
her
arms
round
maggie
neck
and
leaned
her
pale
cheek
against
the
burning
brow
i
stole
out
said
lucy
almost
in
a
whisper
while
she
sat
down
close
to
maggie
and
held
her
hand
when
papa
and
the
rest
were
away
alice
is
come
with
me
i
asked
her
to
help
me
but
i
must
only
stay
a
little
while
because
it
is
so
late
it
was
easier
to
say
that
at
first
than
to
say
anything
else
they
sat
looking
at
each
other
it
seemed
as
if
the
interview
must
end
without
more
speech
for
speech
was
very
difficult
each
felt
that
there
would
be
something
scorching
in
the
words
that
would
recall
the
irretrievable
wrong
but
soon
as
maggie
looked
every
distinct
thought
began
to
be
overflowed
by
a
wave
of
loving
penitence
and
words
burst
forth
with
a
sob
god
bless
you
for
coming
lucy
the
sobs
came
thick
on
each
other
after
that
maggie
dear
be
comforted
said
lucy
now
putting
her
cheek
against
maggie
again
do
grieve
and
she
sat
still
hoping
to
soothe
maggie
with
that
gentle
caress
i
did
mean
to
deceive
you
lucy
said
maggie
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
it
always
made
me
wretched
that
i
felt
what
i
like
you
to
know
it
was
because
i
thought
it
would
all
be
conquered
and
you
might
never
see
anything
to
wound
you
i
know
dear
said
lucy
i
know
you
never
meant
to
make
me
unhappy
it
is
a
trouble
that
has
come
on
us
all
you
have
more
to
bear
than
i
have
and
you
gave
him
up
when
you
did
what
it
must
have
been
very
hard
to
do
they
were
silent
again
a
little
while
sitting
with
clasped
hands
and
cheeks
leaned
together
lucy
maggie
began
again
struggled
too
he
wanted
to
be
true
to
you
he
will
come
back
to
you
forgive
him
he
will
be
happy
then
these
words
were
wrung
forth
from
maggie
deepest
soul
with
an
effort
like
the
convulsed
clutch
of
a
drowning
man
lucy
trembled
and
was
silent
a
gentle
knock
came
at
the
door
it
was
alice
the
maid
who
entered
and
said
i
dare
stay
any
longer
miss
deane
they
find
it
out
and
there
be
such
anger
at
your
coming
out
so
late
lucy
rose
and
said
very
well
alice
in
a
minute
i
to
go
away
on
friday
maggie
she
added
when
alice
had
closed
the
door
again
when
i
come
back
and
am
strong
they
will
let
me
do
as
i
like
i
shall
come
to
you
when
i
please
then
lucy
said
maggie
with
another
great
effort
i
pray
to
god
continually
that
i
may
never
be
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
you
any
more
she
pressed
the
little
hand
that
she
held
between
hers
and
looked
up
into
the
face
that
was
bent
over
hers
lucy
never
forgot
that
look
maggie
she
said
in
a
low
voice
that
had
the
solemnity
of
confession
in
it
you
are
better
than
i
am
i
ca
she
broke
off
there
and
said
no
more
but
they
clasped
each
other
again
in
a
last
embrace
chapter
v
the
last
conflict
in
the
second
week
of
september
maggie
was
again
sitting
in
her
lonely
room
battling
with
the
old
shadowy
enemies
that
were
forever
slain
and
rising
again
it
was
past
midnight
and
the
rain
was
beating
heavily
against
the
window
driven
with
fitful
force
by
the
rushing
wind
for
the
day
after
lucy
visit
there
had
been
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
the
heat
and
drought
had
given
way
to
cold
variable
winds
and
heavy
falls
of
rain
at
intervals
and
she
had
been
forbidden
to
risk
the
contemplated
journey
until
the
weather
should
become
more
settled
in
the
counties
higher
up
the
floss
the
rains
had
been
continuous
and
the
completion
of
the
harvest
had
been
arrested
and
now
for
the
last
two
days
the
rains
on
this
lower
course
of
the
river
had
been
incessant
so
that
the
old
men
had
shaken
their
heads
and
talked
of
sixty
years
ago
when
the
same
sort
of
weather
happening
about
the
equinox
brought
on
the
great
floods
which
swept
the
bridge
away
and
reduced
the
town
to
great
misery
but
the
younger
generation
who
had
seen
several
small
floods
thought
lightly
of
these
sombre
recollections
and
forebodings
and
bob
jakin
naturally
prone
to
take
a
hopeful
view
of
his
own
luck
laughed
at
his
mother
when
she
regretted
their
having
taken
a
house
by
the
riverside
observing
that
but
for
that
they
would
have
had
no
boats
which
were
the
most
lucky
of
possessions
in
case
of
a
flood
that
obliged
them
to
go
to
a
distance
for
food
but
the
careless
and
the
fearful
were
alike
sleeping
in
their
beds
now
there
was
hope
that
the
rain
would
abate
by
the
morrow
threatenings
of
a
worse
kind
from
sudden
thaws
after
falls
of
snow
had
often
passed
off
in
the
experience
of
the
younger
ones
and
at
the
very
worst
the
banks
would
be
sure
to
break
lower
down
the
river
when
the
tide
came
in
with
violence
and
so
the
waters
would
be
carried
off
without
causing
more
than
temporary
inconvenience
and
losses
that
would
be
felt
only
by
the
poorer
sort
whom
charity
would
relieve
all
were
in
their
beds
now
for
it
was
past
midnight
all
except
some
solitary
watchers
such
as
maggie
she
was
seated
in
her
little
parlor
toward
the
river
with
one
candle
that
left
everything
dim
in
the
room
except
a
letter
which
lay
before
her
on
the
table
that
letter
which
had
come
to
her
was
one
of
the
causes
that
had
kept
her
up
far
on
into
the
night
unconscious
how
the
hours
were
going
careless
of
seeking
rest
with
no
image
of
rest
coming
across
her
mind
except
of
that
far
far
off
rest
from
which
there
would
be
no
more
waking
for
her
into
this
struggling
earthly
life
two
days
before
maggie
received
that
letter
she
had
been
to
the
rectory
for
the
last
time
the
heavy
rain
would
have
prevented
her
from
going
since
but
there
was
another
reason
kenn
at
first
enlightened
only
by
a
few
hints
as
to
the
new
turn
which
gossip
and
slander
had
taken
in
relation
to
maggie
had
recently
been
made
more
fully
aware
of
it
by
an
earnest
remonstrance
from
one
of
his
male
parishioners
against
the
indiscretion
of
persisting
in
the
attempt
to
overcome
the
prevalent
feeling
in
the
parish
by
a
course
of
resistance
kenn
having
a
conscience
void
of
offence
in
the
matter
was
still
inclined
to
persevere
was
still
averse
to
give
way
before
a
public
sentiment
that
was
odious
and
contemptible
but
he
was
finally
wrought
upon
by
the
consideration
of
the
peculiar
responsibility
attached
to
his
office
of
avoiding
the
appearance
of
evil
an
appearance
that
is
always
dependent
on
the
average
quality
of
surrounding
minds
where
these
minds
are
low
and
gross
the
area
of
that
appearance
is
proportionately
widened
perhaps
he
was
in
danger
of
acting
from
obstinacy
perhaps
it
was
his
duty
to
succumb
conscientious
people
are
apt
to
see
their
duty
in
that
which
is
the
most
painful
course
and
to
recede
was
always
painful
to
kenn
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
advise
maggie
to
go
away
from
for
a
time
and
he
performed
that
difficult
task
with
as
much
delicacy
as
he
could
only
stating
in
vague
terms
that
he
found
his
attempt
to
countenance
her
stay
was
a
source
of
discord
between
himself
and
his
parishioners
that
was
likely
to
obstruct
his
usefulness
as
a
clergyman
he
begged
her
to
allow
him
to
write
to
a
clerical
friend
of
his
who
might
possibly
take
her
into
his
own
family
as
governess
and
if
not
would
probably
know
of
some
other
available
position
for
a
young
woman
in
whose
welfare
kenn
felt
a
strong
interest
poor
maggie
listened
with
a
trembling
lip
she
could
say
nothing
but
a
faint
thank
you
i
shall
be
grateful
and
she
walked
back
to
her
lodgings
through
the
driving
rain
with
a
new
sense
of
desolation
she
must
be
a
lonely
wanderer
she
must
go
out
among
fresh
faces
that
would
look
at
her
wonderingly
because
the
days
did
not
seem
joyful
to
her
she
must
begin
a
new
life
in
which
she
would
have
to
rouse
herself
to
receive
new
impressions
and
she
was
so
unspeakably
sickeningly
weary
there
was
no
home
no
help
for
the
erring
even
those
who
pitied
were
constrained
to
hardness
but
ought
she
to
complain
ought
she
to
shrink
in
this
way
from
the
long
penance
of
life
which
was
all
the
possibility
she
had
of
lightening
the
load
to
some
other
sufferers
and
so
changing
that
passionate
error
into
a
new
force
of
unselfish
human
love
all
the
next
day
she
sat
in
her
lonely
room
with
a
window
darkened
by
the
cloud
and
the
driving
rain
thinking
of
that
future
and
wrestling
for
patience
for
what
repose
could
poor
maggie
ever
win
except
by
wrestling
and
on
the
third
day
this
day
of
which
she
had
just
sat
out
the
close
the
letter
had
come
which
was
lying
on
the
table
before
her
the
letter
was
from
stephen
he
was
come
back
from
holland
he
was
at
mudport
again
unknown
to
any
of
his
friends
and
had
written
to
her
from
that
place
enclosing
the
letter
to
a
person
whom
he
trusted
in
ogg
from
beginning
to
end
it
was
a
passionate
cry
of
reproach
an
appeal
against
her
useless
sacrifice
of
him
of
herself
against
that
perverted
notion
of
right
which
led
her
to
crush
all
his
hopes
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
idea
and
not
any
substantial
good
hopes
whom
she
loved
and
who
loved
her
with
that
single
overpowering
passion
that
worship
which
a
man
never
gives
to
a
woman
more
than
once
in
his
life
they
have
written
to
me
that
you
are
to
marry
kenn
as
if
i
should
believe
that
perhaps
they
have
told
you
some
such
fables
about
me
perhaps
they
tell
you
i
been
my
body
has
been
dragged
about
somewhere
but
have
never
travelled
from
the
hideous
place
where
you
left
me
where
i
started
up
from
the
stupor
of
helpless
rage
to
find
you
gone
maggie
whose
pain
can
have
been
like
mine
whose
injury
is
like
mine
who
besides
me
has
met
that
long
look
of
love
that
has
burnt
itself
into
my
soul
so
that
no
other
image
can
come
there
maggie
call
me
back
to
you
call
me
back
to
life
and
goodness
i
am
banished
from
both
now
i
have
no
motives
i
am
indifferent
to
everything
two
months
have
only
deepened
the
certainty
that
i
can
never
care
for
life
without
you
write
me
one
word
say
in
two
days
i
should
be
with
you
maggie
have
you
forgotten
what
it
was
to
be
together
to
be
within
reach
of
a
look
to
be
within
hearing
of
each
voice
when
maggie
first
read
this
letter
she
felt
as
if
her
real
temptation
had
only
just
begun
at
the
entrance
of
the
chill
dark
cavern
we
turn
with
unworn
courage
from
the
warm
light
but
how
when
we
have
trodden
far
in
the
damp
darkness
and
have
begun
to
be
faint
and
weary
how
if
there
is
a
sudden
opening
above
us
and
we
are
invited
back
again
to
the
day
the
leap
of
natural
longing
from
under
the
pressure
of
pain
is
so
strong
that
all
less
immediate
motives
are
likely
to
be
forgotten
till
the
pain
has
been
escaped
from
for
hours
maggie
felt
as
if
her
struggle
had
been
in
vain
for
hours
every
other
thought
that
she
strove
to
summon
was
thrust
aside
by
the
image
of
stephen
waiting
for
the
single
word
that
would
bring
him
to
her
she
did
not
the
letter
she
heard
him
uttering
it
and
the
voice
shook
her
with
its
old
strange
power
all
the
day
before
she
had
been
filled
with
the
vision
of
a
lonely
future
through
which
she
must
carry
the
burthen
of
regret
upheld
only
by
clinging
faith
and
here
close
within
her
reach
urging
itself
upon
her
even
as
a
claim
was
another
future
in
which
hard
endurance
and
effort
were
to
be
exchanged
for
easy
delicious
leaning
on
another
loving
strength
and
yet
that
promise
of
joy
in
the
place
of
sadness
did
not
make
the
dire
force
of
the
temptation
to
maggie
it
was
stephen
tone
of
misery
it
was
the
doubt
in
the
justice
of
her
own
resolve
that
made
the
balance
tremble
and
made
her
once
start
from
her
seat
to
reach
the
pen
and
paper
and
write
come
but
close
upon
that
decisive
act
her
mind
recoiled
and
the
sense
of
contradiction
with
her
past
self
in
her
moments
of
strength
and
clearness
came
upon
her
like
a
pang
of
conscious
degradation
no
she
must
wait
she
must
pray
the
light
that
had
forsaken
her
would
come
again
she
should
feel
again
what
she
had
felt
when
she
had
fled
away
under
an
inspiration
strong
enough
to
conquer
agony
to
conquer
love
she
should
feel
again
what
she
had
felt
when
lucy
stood
by
her
when
philip
letter
had
stirred
all
the
fibres
that
bound
her
to
the
calmer
past
she
sat
quite
still
far
on
into
the
night
with
no
impulse
to
change
her
attitude
without
active
force
enough
even
for
the
mental
act
of
prayer
only
waiting
for
the
light
that
would
surely
come
again
it
came
with
the
memories
that
no
passion
could
long
quench
the
long
past
came
back
to
her
and
with
it
the
fountains
of
pity
and
affection
of
faithfulness
and
resolve
the
words
that
were
marked
by
the
quiet
hand
in
the
little
old
book
that
she
had
long
ago
learned
by
heart
rushed
even
to
her
lips
and
found
a
vent
for
themselves
in
a
low
murmur
that
was
quite
lost
in
the
loud
driving
of
the
rain
against
the
window
and
the
loud
moan
and
roar
of
the
wind
i
have
received
the
cross
i
have
received
it
from
thy
hand
i
will
bear
it
and
bear
it
till
death
as
thou
hast
laid
it
upon
me
but
soon
other
words
rose
that
could
find
no
utterance
but
in
a
sob
forgive
me
stephen
it
will
pass
away
you
will
come
back
to
her
she
took
up
the
letter
held
it
to
the
candle
and
let
it
burn
slowly
on
the
hearth
she
would
write
to
him
the
last
word
of
parting
i
will
bear
it
and
bear
it
till
death
but
how
long
it
will
be
before
death
comes
i
am
so
young
so
healthy
how
shall
i
have
patience
and
strength
am
i
to
struggle
and
fall
and
repent
again
has
life
other
trials
as
hard
for
me
still
with
that
cry
of
maggie
fell
on
her
knees
against
the
table
and
buried
her
face
her
soul
went
out
to
the
unseen
pity
that
would
be
with
her
to
the
end
surely
there
was
something
being
taught
her
by
this
experience
of
great
need
and
she
must
be
learning
a
secret
of
human
tenderness
and
that
the
less
erring
could
hardly
know
o
god
if
my
life
is
to
be
long
let
me
live
to
bless
and
comfort
at
that
moment
maggie
felt
a
startling
sensation
of
sudden
cold
about
her
knees
and
feet
it
was
water
flowing
under
her
she
started
up
the
stream
was
flowing
under
the
door
that
led
into
the
passage
she
was
not
bewildered
for
an
instant
she
knew
it
was
the
flood
the
tumult
of
emotion
she
had
been
enduring
for
the
last
twelve
hours
seemed
to
have
left
a
great
calm
in
her
without
screaming
she
hurried
with
the
candle
upstairs
to
bob
jakin
bedroom
the
door
was
ajar
she
went
in
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
bob
the
flood
is
come
it
is
in
the
house
let
us
see
if
we
can
make
the
boats
safe
she
lighted
his
candle
while
the
poor
wife
snatching
up
her
baby
burst
into
screams
and
then
she
hurried
down
again
to
see
if
the
waters
were
rising
fast
there
was
a
step
down
into
the
room
at
the
door
leading
from
the
staircase
she
saw
that
the
water
was
already
on
a
level
with
the
step
while
she
was
looking
something
came
with
a
tremendous
crash
against
the
window
and
sent
the
leaded
panes
and
the
old
wooden
framework
inward
in
shivers
the
water
pouring
in
after
it
it
is
the
boat
cried
maggie
bob
come
down
to
get
the
boats
and
without
a
moment
shudder
of
fear
she
plunged
through
the
water
which
was
rising
fast
to
her
knees
and
by
the
glimmering
light
of
the
candle
she
had
left
on
the
stairs
she
mounted
on
to
the
and
crept
into
the
boat
which
was
left
with
the
prow
lodging
and
protruding
through
the
window
bob
was
not
long
after
her
hurrying
without
shoes
or
stockings
but
with
the
lanthorn
in
his
hand
why
they
both
here
both
the
boats
said
bob
as
he
got
into
the
one
where
maggie
was
it
wonderful
this
fastening
is
broke
too
as
well
as
the
mooring
in
the
excitement
of
getting
into
the
other
boat
unfastening
it
and
mastering
an
oar
bob
was
not
struck
with
the
danger
maggie
incurred
we
are
not
apt
to
fear
for
the
fearless
when
we
are
companions
in
their
danger
and
bob
mind
was
absorbed
in
possible
expedients
for
the
safety
of
the
helpless
indoors
the
fact
that
maggie
had
been
up
had
waked
him
and
had
taken
the
lead
in
activity
gave
bob
a
vague
impression
of
her
as
one
who
would
help
to
protect
not
need
to
be
protected
she
too
had
got
possession
of
an
oar
and
had
pushed
off
so
as
to
release
the
boat
from
the
overhanging
the
water
rising
so
fast
said
bob
i
doubt
it
be
in
at
the
chambers
before
long
th
house
is
so
low
i
more
mind
to
get
prissy
and
the
child
and
the
mother
into
the
boat
if
i
could
and
trusten
to
the
water
for
th
old
house
is
none
so
safe
and
if
i
let
go
the
boat
but
he
exclaimed
suddenly
lifting
the
light
of
his
lanthorn
on
maggie
as
she
stood
in
the
rain
with
the
oar
in
her
hand
and
her
black
hair
streaming
maggie
had
no
time
to
answer
for
a
new
tidal
current
swept
along
the
line
of
the
houses
and
drove
both
the
boats
out
on
to
the
wide
water
with
a
force
that
carried
them
far
past
the
meeting
current
of
the
river
in
the
first
moments
maggie
felt
nothing
thought
of
nothing
but
that
she
had
suddenly
passed
away
from
that
life
which
she
had
been
dreading
it
was
the
transition
of
death
without
its
agony
and
she
was
alone
in
the
darkness
with
god
the
whole
thing
had
been
so
rapid
so
dreamlike
that
the
threads
of
ordinary
association
were
broken
she
sank
down
on
the
seat
clutching
the
oar
mechanically
and
for
a
long
while
had
no
distinct
conception
of
her
position
the
first
thing
that
waked
her
to
fuller
consciousness
was
the
cessation
of
the
rain
and
a
perception
that
the
darkness
was
divided
by
the
faintest
light
which
parted
the
overhanging
gloom
from
the
immeasurable
watery
level
below
she
was
driven
out
upon
the
flood
that
awful
visitation
of
god
which
her
father
used
to
talk
of
which
had
made
the
nightmare
of
her
childish
dreams
and
with
that
thought
there
rushed
in
the
vision
of
the
old
home
and
tom
and
her
mother
they
had
all
listened
together
o
god
where
am
i
which
is
the
way
home
she
cried
out
in
the
dim
loneliness
what
was
happening
to
them
at
the
mill
the
flood
had
once
nearly
destroyed
it
they
might
be
in
danger
in
distress
her
mother
and
her
brother
alone
there
beyond
reach
of
help
her
whole
soul
was
strained
now
on
that
thought
and
she
saw
the
faces
looking
for
help
into
the
darkness
and
finding
none
she
was
floating
in
smooth
water
now
perhaps
far
on
the
overflooded
fields
there
was
no
sense
of
present
danger
to
check
the
outgoing
of
her
mind
to
the
old
home
and
she
strained
her
eyes
against
the
curtain
of
gloom
that
she
might
seize
the
first
sight
of
her
whereabout
that
she
might
catch
some
faint
suggestion
of
the
spot
toward
which
all
her
anxieties
tended
oh
how
welcome
the
widening
of
that
dismal
watery
level
the
gradual
uplifting
of
the
cloudy
firmament
the
slowly
defining
blackness
of
objects
above
the
glassy
dark
yes
she
must
be
out
on
the
fields
those
were
the
tops
of
hedgerow
trees
which
way
did
the
river
lie
looking
behind
her
she
saw
the
lines
of
black
trees
looking
before
her
there
were
none
then
the
river
lay
before
her
she
seized
an
oar
and
began
to
paddle
the
boat
forward
with
the
energy
of
wakening
hope
the
dawning
seemed
to
advance
more
swiftly
now
she
was
in
action
and
she
could
soon
see
the
poor
dumb
beasts
crowding
piteously
on
a
mound
where
they
had
taken
refuge
onward
she
paddled
and
rowed
by
turns
in
the
growing
twilight
her
wet
clothes
clung
round
her
and
her
streaming
hair
was
dashed
about
by
the
wind
but
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
any
bodily
sensations
except
a
sensation
of
strength
inspired
by
mighty
emotion
along
with
the
sense
of
danger
and
possible
rescue
for
those
beings
at
the
old
home
there
was
an
undefined
sense
of
reconcilement
with
her
brother
what
quarrel
what
harshness
what
unbelief
in
each
other
can
subsist
in
the
presence
of
a
great
calamity
when
all
the
artificial
vesture
of
our
life
is
gone
and
we
are
all
one
with
each
other
in
primitive
mortal
needs
vaguely
maggie
felt
this
in
the
strong
resurgent
love
toward
her
brother
that
swept
away
all
the
later
impressions
of
hard
cruel
offence
and
misunderstanding
and
left
only
the
deep
underlying
unshakable
memories
of
early
union
but
now
there
was
a
large
dark
mass
in
the
distance
and
near
to
her
maggie
could
discern
the
current
of
the
river
the
dark
mass
must
be
yes
it
was
ogg
ah
now
she
knew
which
way
to
look
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
trees
the
gray
willows
the
now
yellowing
chestnuts
and
above
them
the
old
roof
but
there
was
no
color
no
shape
yet
all
was
faint
and
dim
more
and
more
strongly
the
energies
seemed
to
come
and
put
themselves
forth
as
if
her
life
were
a
force
that
was
being
spent
in
this
hour
unneeded
for
any
future
she
must
get
her
boat
into
the
current
of
the
floss
else
she
would
never
be
able
to
pass
the
ripple
and
approach
the
house
this
was
the
thought
that
occurred
to
her
as
she
imagined
with
more
and
more
vividness
the
state
of
things
round
the
old
home
but
then
she
might
be
carried
very
far
down
and
be
unable
to
guide
her
boat
out
of
the
current
again
for
the
first
time
distinct
ideas
of
danger
began
to
press
upon
her
but
there
was
no
choice
of
courses
no
room
for
hesitation
and
she
floated
into
the
current
swiftly
she
went
now
without
effort
more
and
more
clearly
in
the
lessening
distance
and
the
growing
light
she
began
to
discern
the
objects
that
she
knew
must
be
the
trees
and
roofs
nay
she
was
not
far
off
a
rushing
muddy
current
that
must
be
the
strangely
altered
ripple
great
god
there
were
floating
masses
in
it
that
might
dash
against
her
boat
as
she
passed
and
cause
her
to
perish
too
soon
what
were
those
masses
for
the
first
time
maggie
heart
began
to
beat
in
an
agony
of
dread
she
sat
helpless
dimly
conscious
that
she
was
being
floated
along
more
intensely
conscious
of
the
anticipated
clash
but
the
horror
was
transient
it
passed
away
before
the
oncoming
warehouses
of
ogg
she
had
passed
the
mouth
of
the
ripple
then
she
must
use
all
her
skill
and
power
to
manage
the
boat
and
get
it
if
possible
out
of
the
current
she
could
see
now
that
the
bridge
was
broken
down
she
could
see
the
masts
of
a
stranded
vessel
far
out
over
the
watery
field
but
no
boats
were
to
be
seen
moving
on
the
river
such
as
had
been
laid
hands
on
were
employed
in
the
flooded
streets
with
new
resolution
maggie
seized
her
oar
and
stood
up
again
to
paddle
but
the
now
ebbing
tide
added
to
the
swiftness
of
the
river
and
she
was
carried
along
beyond
the
bridge
she
could
hear
shouts
from
the
windows
overlooking
the
river
as
if
the
people
there
were
calling
to
her
it
was
not
till
she
had
passed
on
nearly
to
tofton
that
she
could
get
the
boat
clear
of
the
current
then
with
one
yearning
look
toward
her
uncle
deane
house
that
lay
farther
down
the
river
she
took
to
both
her
oars
and
rowed
with
all
her
might
across
the
watery
fields
back
toward
the
mill
color
was
beginning
to
awake
now
and
as
she
approached
the
dorlcote
fields
she
could
discern
the
tints
of
the
trees
could
see
the
old
scotch
firs
far
to
the
right
and
the
home
chestnuts
oh
how
deep
they
lay
in
the
water
deeper
than
the
trees
on
this
side
the
hill
and
the
roof
of
the
mill
where
was
it
those
heavy
fragments
hurrying
down
the
ripple
what
had
they
meant
but
it
was
not
the
house
the
house
stood
firm
drowned
up
to
the
first
story
but
still
firm
or
was
it
broken
in
at
the
end
toward
the
mill
with
panting
joy
that
she
was
there
at
last
joy
that
overcame
all
distress
maggie
neared
the
front
of
the
house
at
first
she
heard
no
sound
she
saw
no
object
moving
her
boat
was
on
a
level
with
the
upstairs
window
she
called
out
in
a
loud
piercing
voice
tom
where
are
you
mother
where
are
you
here
is
maggie
soon
from
the
window
of
the
attic
in
the
central
gable
she
heard
tom
voice
who
is
it
have
you
brought
a
boat
it
is
i
tom
maggie
where
is
mother
she
is
not
here
she
went
to
garum
the
day
before
yesterday
come
down
to
the
lower
window
alone
maggie
said
tom
in
a
voice
of
deep
astonishment
as
he
opened
the
middle
window
on
a
level
with
the
boat
yes
tom
god
has
taken
care
of
me
to
bring
me
to
you
get
in
quickly
is
there
no
one
else
no
said
tom
stepping
into
the
boat
i
fear
the
man
is
drowned
he
was
carried
down
the
ripple
i
think
when
part
of
the
mill
fell
with
the
crash
of
trees
and
stones
against
it
i
shouted
again
and
again
and
there
has
been
no
answer
give
me
the
oars
maggie
it
was
not
till
tom
had
pushed
off
and
they
were
on
the
wide
water
he
face
to
face
with
maggie
that
the
full
meaning
of
what
had
happened
rushed
upon
his
mind
it
came
with
so
overpowering
a
force
it
was
such
a
new
revelation
to
his
spirit
of
the
depths
in
life
that
had
lain
beyond
his
vision
which
he
had
fancied
so
keen
and
clear
that
he
was
unable
to
ask
a
question
they
sat
mutely
gazing
at
each
other
maggie
with
eyes
of
intense
life
looking
out
from
a
weary
beaten
face
tom
pale
with
a
certain
awe
and
humiliation
thought
was
busy
though
the
lips
were
silent
and
though
he
could
ask
no
question
he
guessed
a
story
of
almost
miraculous
divinely
protected
effort
but
at
last
a
mist
gathered
over
the
eyes
and
the
lips
found
a
word
they
could
utter
the
old
childish
magsie
maggie
could
make
no
answer
but
a
long
deep
sob
of
that
mysterious
wondrous
happiness
that
is
one
with
pain
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
said
we
will
go
to
lucy
tom
go
and
see
if
she
is
safe
and
then
we
can
help
the
rest
tom
rowed
with
untired
vigor
and
with
a
different
speed
from
poor
maggie
the
boat
was
soon
in
the
current
of
the
river
again
and
soon
they
would
be
at
tofton
park
house
stands
high
up
out
of
the
flood
said
maggie
perhaps
they
have
got
lucy
there
nothing
else
was
said
a
new
danger
was
being
carried
toward
them
by
the
river
some
wooden
machinery
had
just
given
way
on
one
of
the
wharves
and
huge
fragments
were
being
floated
along
the
sun
was
rising
now
and
the
wide
area
of
watery
desolation
was
spread
out
in
dreadful
clearness
around
them
in
dreadful
clearness
floated
onward
the
hurrying
threatening
masses
a
large
company
in
a
boat
that
was
working
its
way
along
under
the
tofton
houses
observed
their
danger
and
shouted
get
out
of
the
current
but
that
could
not
be
done
at
once
and
tom
looking
before
him
saw
death
rushing
on
them
huge
fragments
clinging
together
in
fatal
fellowship
made
one
wide
mass
across
the
stream
it
is
coming
maggie
tom
said
in
a
deep
hoarse
voice
loosing
the
oars
and
clasping
her
the
next
instant
the
boat
was
no
longer
seen
upon
the
water
and
the
huge
mass
was
hurrying
on
in
hideous
triumph
but
soon
the
keel
of
the
boat
reappeared
a
black
speck
on
the
golden
water
the
boat
reappeared
but
brother
and
sister
had
gone
down
in
an
embrace
never
to
be
parted
living
through
again
in
one
supreme
moment
the
days
when
they
had
clasped
their
little
hands
in
love
and
roamed
the
daisied
fields
together
conclusion
nature
repairs
her
ravages
repairs
them
with
her
sunshine
and
with
human
labor
the
desolation
wrought
by
that
flood
had
left
little
visible
trace
on
the
face
of
the
earth
five
years
after
the
fifth
autumn
was
rich
in
golden
cornstacks
rising
in
thick
clusters
among
the
distant
hedgerows
the
wharves
and
warehouses
on
the
floss
were
busy
again
with
echoes
of
eager
voices
with
hopeful
lading
and
unlading
and
every
man
and
woman
mentioned
in
this
history
was
still
living
except
those
whose
end
we
know
nature
repairs
her
ravages
but
not
all
the
uptorn
trees
are
not
rooted
again
the
parted
hills
are
left
scarred
if
there
is
a
new
growth
the
trees
are
not
the
same
as
the
old
and
the
hills
underneath
their
green
vesture
bear
the
marks
of
the
past
rending
to
the
eyes
that
have
dwelt
on
the
past
there
is
no
thorough
repair
dorlcote
mill
was
rebuilt
and
dorlcote
churchyard
where
the
brick
grave
that
held
a
father
whom
we
know
was
found
with
the
stone
laid
prostrate
upon
it
after
the
flood
had
recovered
all
its
grassy
order
and
decent
quiet
near
that
brick
grave
there
was
a
tomb
erected
very
soon
after
the
flood
for
two
bodies
that
were
found
in
close
embrace
and
it
was
visited
at
different
moments
by
two
men
who
both
felt
that
their
keenest
joy
and
keenest
sorrow
were
forever
buried
there
one
of
them
visited
the
tomb
again
with
a
sweet
face
beside
him
but
that
was
years
after
the
other
was
always
solitary
his
great
companionship
was
among
the
trees
of
the
red
deeps
where
the
buried
joy
seemed
still
to
hover
like
a
revisiting
spirit
the
tomb
bore
the
names
of
tom
and
maggie
tulliver
and
below
the
names
it
was
written
in
their
death
they
were
not
divided
