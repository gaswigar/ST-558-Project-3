the
history
of
polly
by
wells
chapter
the
first
beginnings
and
the
bazaar
i
hole
said
polly
and
then
for
a
change
and
with
greatly
increased
emphasis
he
paused
and
then
broke
out
with
one
of
his
private
and
peculiar
idioms
oh
beastly
silly
wheeze
of
a
hole
he
was
sitting
on
a
stile
between
two
threadbare
looking
fields
and
suffering
acutely
from
indigestion
he
suffered
from
indigestion
now
nearly
every
afternoon
in
his
life
but
as
he
lacked
introspection
he
projected
the
associated
discomfort
upon
the
world
every
afternoon
he
discovered
afresh
that
life
as
a
whole
and
every
aspect
of
life
that
presented
itself
was
beastly
and
this
afternoon
lured
by
the
delusive
blueness
of
a
sky
that
was
blue
because
the
wind
was
in
the
east
he
had
come
out
in
the
hope
of
snatching
something
of
the
joyousness
of
spring
the
mysterious
alchemy
of
mind
and
body
refused
however
to
permit
any
joyousness
whatever
in
the
spring
he
had
had
a
little
difficulty
in
finding
his
cap
before
he
came
out
he
wanted
his
cap
the
new
golf
cap
and
polly
must
needs
fish
out
his
old
soft
brown
felt
hat
your
she
said
in
a
tone
of
insincere
encouragement
he
had
been
routing
among
the
piled
newspapers
under
the
kitchen
dresser
and
had
turned
quite
hopefully
and
taken
the
thing
he
put
it
on
but
it
did
feel
right
nothing
felt
right
he
put
a
trembling
hand
upon
the
crown
of
the
thing
and
pressed
it
on
his
head
and
tried
it
askew
to
the
right
and
then
askew
to
the
left
then
the
full
sense
of
the
indignity
offered
him
came
home
to
him
the
hat
masked
the
upper
sinister
quarter
of
his
face
and
he
spoke
with
a
wrathful
eye
regarding
his
wife
from
under
the
brim
in
a
voice
thick
with
fury
he
said
i
you
like
me
to
wear
that
silly
mud
pie
for
ever
eh
i
tell
you
i
wo
i
sick
of
it
i
pretty
near
sick
of
everything
comes
to
that
hat
he
clutched
it
with
quivering
fingers
hat
he
repeated
then
he
flung
it
to
the
ground
and
kicked
it
with
extraordinary
fury
across
the
kitchen
it
flew
up
against
the
door
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
its
ribbon
band
half
off
sha
go
out
he
said
and
sticking
his
hands
into
his
jacket
pockets
discovered
the
missing
cap
in
the
right
one
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
straight
upstairs
without
a
word
and
out
slamming
the
shop
door
hard
beauty
said
polly
at
last
to
a
tremendous
silence
picking
up
and
dusting
the
rejected
headdress
tantrums
she
added
i
patience
and
moving
with
the
slow
reluctance
of
a
deeply
offended
woman
she
began
to
pile
together
the
simple
apparatus
of
their
recent
meal
for
transportation
to
the
scullery
sink
the
repast
she
had
prepared
for
him
did
not
seem
to
her
to
justify
his
ingratitude
there
had
been
the
cold
pork
from
sunday
and
some
nice
cold
potatoes
and
rashdall
mixed
pickles
of
which
he
was
inordinately
fond
he
had
eaten
three
gherkins
two
onions
a
small
cauliflower
head
and
several
capers
with
every
appearance
of
appetite
and
indeed
with
avidity
and
then
there
had
been
cold
suet
pudding
to
follow
with
treacle
and
then
a
nice
bit
of
cheese
it
was
the
pale
hard
sort
of
cheese
he
liked
red
cheese
he
declared
was
indigestible
he
had
also
had
three
big
slices
of
greyish
baker
bread
and
had
drunk
the
best
part
of
the
jugful
of
beer
but
there
seems
to
be
no
pleasing
some
people
tantrums
said
polly
at
the
sink
struggling
with
the
mustard
on
his
plate
and
expressing
the
only
solution
of
the
problem
that
occurred
to
her
and
polly
sat
on
the
stile
and
hated
the
whole
scheme
of
life
which
was
at
once
excessive
and
inadequate
as
a
solution
he
hated
foxbourne
he
hated
foxbourne
high
street
he
hated
his
shop
and
his
wife
and
his
neighbours
every
blessed
neighbour
and
with
indescribable
bitterness
he
hated
himself
why
did
i
ever
get
in
this
silly
hole
he
said
why
did
i
ever
he
sat
on
the
stile
and
looked
with
eyes
that
seemed
blurred
with
impalpable
flaws
at
a
world
in
which
even
the
spring
buds
were
wilted
the
sunlight
metallic
and
the
shadows
mixed
with
ink
to
the
moralist
i
know
he
might
have
served
as
a
figure
of
sinful
discontent
but
that
is
because
it
is
the
habit
of
moralists
to
ignore
material
circumstances
if
indeed
one
may
speak
of
a
recent
meal
as
a
circumstance
with
polly
drink
indeed
our
teachers
will
criticise
nowadays
both
as
regards
quantity
and
quality
but
neither
church
nor
state
nor
school
will
raise
a
warning
finger
between
a
man
and
his
hunger
and
his
wife
catering
so
on
nearly
every
day
in
his
life
polly
fell
into
a
violent
rage
and
hatred
against
the
outer
world
in
the
afternoon
and
never
suspected
that
it
was
this
inner
world
to
which
i
am
with
such
masterly
delicacy
alluding
that
was
thus
reflecting
its
sinister
disorder
upon
the
things
without
it
is
a
pity
that
some
human
beings
are
not
more
transparent
if
polly
for
example
had
been
transparent
or
even
passably
translucent
then
perhaps
he
might
have
realised
from
the
laocoon
struggle
he
would
have
glimpsed
that
indeed
he
was
not
so
much
a
human
being
as
a
civil
war
wonderful
things
must
have
been
going
on
inside
polly
oh
wonderful
things
it
must
have
been
like
a
badly
managed
industrial
city
during
a
period
of
depression
agitators
acts
of
violence
strikes
the
forces
of
law
and
order
doing
their
best
rushings
to
and
fro
upheavals
the
tumbrils
the
rumble
and
the
thunder
of
the
tumbrils
i
do
not
know
why
the
east
wind
aggravates
life
to
unhealthy
people
it
made
polly
teeth
seem
loose
in
his
head
and
his
skin
feel
like
a
misfit
and
his
hair
a
dry
stringy
exasperation
why
can
not
doctors
give
us
an
antidote
to
the
east
wind
never
have
the
sense
to
get
your
hair
cut
till
it
too
long
said
polly
catching
sight
of
his
shadow
you
blighted
degenerated
paintbrush
ugh
and
he
flattened
down
the
projecting
tails
with
an
urgent
hand
ii
polly
age
was
exactly
years
and
a
half
he
was
a
short
compact
figure
and
a
little
inclined
to
a
localised
his
face
was
not
unpleasing
the
features
fine
but
a
trifle
too
pointed
about
the
nose
to
be
classically
perfect
the
corners
of
his
sensitive
mouth
were
depressed
his
eyes
were
ruddy
brown
and
troubled
and
the
left
one
was
round
with
more
of
wonder
in
it
than
its
fellow
his
complexion
was
dull
and
yellowish
that
as
i
have
explained
on
account
of
those
civil
disturbances
he
was
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
word
clean
shaved
with
a
small
sallow
patch
under
the
right
ear
and
a
cut
on
the
chin
his
brow
had
the
little
puckerings
of
a
thoroughly
discontented
man
little
wrinklings
and
lumps
particularly
over
his
right
eye
and
he
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
little
askew
on
the
stile
and
swung
one
leg
hole
he
repeated
presently
he
broke
into
a
quavering
song
silly
hole
his
voice
thickened
with
rage
and
the
rest
of
his
discourse
was
marred
by
an
unfortunate
choice
of
epithets
he
was
dressed
in
a
shabby
black
morning
coat
and
vest
the
braid
that
bound
these
garments
was
a
little
loose
in
places
his
collar
was
chosen
from
stock
and
with
projecting
corners
technically
a
that
and
his
tie
which
was
new
and
loose
and
rich
in
colouring
had
been
selected
to
encourage
and
stimulate
customers
for
he
dealt
in
gentlemen
outfitting
his
golf
cap
which
was
also
from
stock
and
aslant
over
his
eye
gave
his
misery
a
desperate
touch
he
wore
brown
leather
boots
because
he
hated
the
smell
of
blacking
perhaps
after
all
it
was
not
simply
indigestion
that
troubled
him
behind
the
superficialities
of
polly
being
moved
a
larger
and
vaguer
distress
the
elementary
education
he
had
acquired
had
left
him
with
the
impression
that
arithmetic
was
a
fluky
science
and
best
avoided
in
practical
affairs
but
even
the
absence
of
and
a
total
inability
to
distinguish
between
capital
and
interest
could
not
blind
him
for
ever
to
the
fact
that
the
little
shop
in
the
high
street
was
not
paying
an
absence
of
returns
a
constriction
of
credit
a
depleted
till
the
most
valiant
resolves
to
keep
smiling
could
not
prevail
for
ever
against
these
insistent
phenomena
one
might
bustle
about
in
the
morning
before
dinner
and
in
the
afternoon
after
tea
and
forget
that
huge
dark
cloud
of
insolvency
that
gathered
and
spread
in
the
background
but
it
was
part
of
the
desolation
of
these
afternoon
periods
these
grey
spaces
of
time
after
meals
when
all
one
courage
had
descended
to
the
unseen
battles
of
the
pit
that
life
seemed
stripped
to
the
bone
and
one
saw
with
a
hopeless
clearness
let
me
tell
the
history
of
polly
from
the
cradle
to
these
present
difficulties
first
the
infant
mewling
and
puking
in
its
nurse
arms
there
had
been
a
time
when
two
people
had
thought
polly
the
most
wonderful
and
adorable
thing
in
the
world
had
kissed
his
saying
myum
myum
and
marvelled
at
the
exquisite
softness
and
delicacy
of
his
hair
had
called
to
one
another
to
remark
the
peculiar
distinction
with
which
he
bubbled
had
disputed
whether
the
sound
he
had
made
was
da
or
truly
and
intentionally
dadda
had
washed
him
in
the
utmost
detail
and
wrapped
him
up
in
soft
warm
blankets
and
smothered
him
with
kisses
a
regal
time
that
was
and
four
and
thirty
years
ago
and
a
merciful
forgetfulness
barred
polly
from
ever
bringing
its
careless
luxury
its
autocratic
demands
and
instant
obedience
into
contrast
with
his
present
condition
of
life
these
two
people
had
worshipped
him
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
exquisite
feet
and
also
they
had
fed
him
rather
unwisely
for
no
one
had
ever
troubled
to
teach
his
mother
anything
about
the
mysteries
of
a
child
upbringing
though
of
course
the
monthly
nurse
and
her
charwoman
gave
some
valuable
hints
and
by
his
fifth
birthday
the
perfect
rhythms
of
his
nice
new
interior
were
already
darkened
with
perplexity
his
mother
died
when
he
was
seven
he
began
only
to
have
distinctive
memories
of
himself
in
the
time
when
his
education
had
already
begun
i
remember
seeing
a
picture
of
education
in
some
place
i
think
it
was
education
but
quite
conceivably
it
represented
the
empire
teaching
her
sons
and
i
have
a
strong
impression
that
it
was
a
wall
painting
upon
some
public
building
in
manchester
or
birmingham
or
glasgow
but
very
possibly
i
am
mistaken
about
that
it
represented
a
glorious
woman
with
a
wise
and
fearless
face
stooping
over
her
children
and
pointing
them
to
far
horizons
the
sky
displayed
the
pearly
warmth
of
a
summer
dawn
and
all
the
painting
was
marvellously
bright
as
if
with
the
youth
and
hope
of
the
delicately
beautiful
children
in
the
foreground
she
was
telling
them
one
felt
of
the
great
prospect
of
life
that
opened
before
them
of
the
spectacle
of
the
world
the
splendours
of
sea
and
mountain
they
might
travel
and
see
the
joys
of
skill
they
might
acquire
of
effort
and
the
pride
of
effort
and
the
devotions
and
nobilities
it
was
theirs
to
achieve
perhaps
even
she
whispered
of
the
warm
triumphant
mystery
of
love
that
comes
at
last
to
those
who
have
patience
and
unblemished
hearts
she
was
reminding
them
of
their
great
heritage
as
english
children
rulers
of
more
than
of
mankind
of
the
obligation
to
do
and
be
the
best
that
such
a
pride
of
empire
entails
of
their
essential
nobility
and
knighthood
and
the
restraints
and
the
charities
and
the
disciplined
strength
that
is
becoming
in
knights
and
rulers
the
education
of
polly
did
not
follow
this
picture
very
closely
he
went
for
some
time
to
a
national
school
which
was
run
on
severely
economical
lines
to
keep
down
the
rates
by
a
largely
untrained
staff
he
was
set
sums
to
do
that
he
did
not
understand
and
that
no
one
made
him
understand
he
was
made
to
read
the
catechism
and
bible
with
the
utmost
industry
and
an
entire
disregard
of
punctuation
or
significance
and
caused
to
imitate
writing
copies
and
drawing
copies
and
given
object
lessons
upon
sealing
wax
and
and
potato
bugs
and
ginger
and
iron
and
such
like
things
and
taught
various
other
subjects
his
mind
refused
to
entertain
and
afterwards
when
he
was
about
twelve
he
was
jerked
by
his
parent
to
finish
off
in
a
private
school
of
dingy
aspect
and
still
dingier
pretensions
where
there
were
no
object
lessons
and
the
studies
of
and
french
were
pursued
but
never
effectually
overtaken
under
the
guidance
of
an
elderly
gentleman
who
wore
a
nondescript
gown
and
took
snuff
wrote
copperplate
explained
nothing
and
used
a
cane
with
remarkable
dexterity
and
gusto
polly
went
into
the
national
school
at
six
and
he
left
the
private
school
at
fourteen
and
by
that
time
his
mind
was
in
much
the
same
state
that
you
would
be
in
dear
reader
if
you
were
operated
upon
for
appendicitis
by
a
boldly
enterprising
but
rather
and
butcher
boy
who
was
superseded
towards
the
climax
of
the
operation
by
a
clerk
of
high
principles
but
intemperate
habits
that
is
to
say
it
was
in
a
thorough
mess
the
nice
little
curiosities
and
willingnesses
of
a
child
were
in
a
jumbled
and
thwarted
condition
hacked
and
cut
about
the
operators
had
left
so
to
speak
all
their
sponges
and
ligatures
in
the
mangled
confusion
and
polly
had
lost
much
of
his
natural
confidence
so
far
as
figures
and
sciences
and
languages
and
the
possibilities
of
learning
things
were
concerned
he
thought
of
the
present
world
no
longer
as
a
wonderland
of
experiences
but
as
geography
and
history
as
the
repeating
of
names
that
were
hard
to
pronounce
and
lists
of
products
and
populations
and
heights
and
lengths
and
as
lists
and
dates
oh
and
boredom
indescribable
he
thought
of
religion
as
the
recital
of
more
or
less
incomprehensible
words
that
were
hard
to
remember
and
of
the
divinity
as
of
a
limitless
being
having
the
nature
of
a
schoolmaster
and
making
infinite
rules
known
and
unknown
rules
that
were
always
ruthlessly
enforced
and
with
an
infinite
capacity
for
punishment
and
most
horrible
of
all
to
think
of
limitless
powers
of
espial
so
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
did
not
think
of
that
unrelenting
eye
he
was
uncertain
about
the
spelling
and
pronunciation
of
most
of
the
words
in
our
beautiful
but
abundant
and
perplexing
tongue
that
especially
was
a
pity
because
words
attracted
him
and
under
happier
conditions
he
might
have
used
them
well
he
was
always
doubtful
whether
it
was
eight
sevens
or
nine
eights
that
was
he
knew
no
method
for
settling
the
difficulty
and
he
thought
the
merit
of
a
drawing
consisted
in
the
care
with
which
it
was
lined
in
lining
in
bored
him
beyond
measure
but
the
of
mind
and
body
that
were
to
play
so
large
a
part
in
his
subsequent
career
were
still
only
beginning
his
liver
and
his
gastric
juice
his
wonder
and
imagination
kept
up
a
fight
against
the
things
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
soul
and
body
together
outside
the
regions
devastated
by
the
school
curriculum
he
was
still
intensely
curious
he
had
cheerful
phases
of
enterprise
and
about
thirteen
he
suddenly
discovered
reading
and
its
joys
he
began
to
read
stories
voraciously
and
books
of
travel
provided
they
were
also
adventurous
he
got
these
chiefly
from
the
local
institute
and
he
also
took
in
irregularly
but
thoroughly
one
of
those
inspiring
weeklies
that
dull
people
used
to
call
penny
dreadfuls
admirable
weeklies
crammed
with
imagination
that
the
cheap
boys
comics
of
have
replaced
at
fourteen
when
he
emerged
from
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
education
there
survived
something
indeed
it
survived
still
obscured
and
thwarted
at
five
and
thirty
that
pointed
not
with
a
visible
and
prevailing
finger
like
the
finger
of
that
beautiful
woman
in
the
picture
but
pointed
nevertheless
to
the
idea
that
there
was
interest
and
happiness
in
the
world
deep
in
the
being
of
polly
deep
in
that
darkness
like
a
creature
which
has
been
beaten
about
the
head
and
left
for
dead
but
still
lives
crawled
a
persuasion
that
over
and
above
the
things
that
are
jolly
and
bits
of
all
right
there
was
beauty
there
was
delight
that
somewhere
magically
inaccessible
perhaps
but
still
somewhere
were
pure
and
easy
and
joyous
states
of
body
and
mind
he
would
sneak
out
on
moonless
winter
nights
and
stare
up
at
the
stars
and
afterwards
find
it
difficult
to
tell
his
father
where
he
had
been
he
would
read
tales
about
hunters
and
explorers
and
imagine
himself
riding
mustangs
as
fleet
as
the
wind
across
the
prairies
of
western
america
or
coming
as
a
conquering
and
adored
white
man
into
the
swarming
villages
of
central
africa
he
shot
bears
with
a
revolver
a
cigarette
in
the
other
hand
and
made
a
necklace
of
their
teeth
and
claws
for
the
chief
beautiful
young
daughter
also
he
killed
a
lion
with
a
pointed
stake
stabbing
through
the
beast
heart
as
it
stood
over
him
he
thought
it
would
be
splendid
to
be
a
diver
and
go
down
into
the
dark
green
mysteries
of
the
sea
he
led
stormers
against
impregnable
forts
and
died
on
the
ramparts
at
the
moment
of
victory
his
grave
was
watered
by
a
nation
tears
he
rammed
and
torpedoed
ships
one
against
ten
he
was
beloved
by
queens
in
barbaric
lands
and
reconciled
whole
nations
to
the
christian
faith
he
was
martyred
and
took
it
very
calmly
and
beautifully
but
only
once
or
twice
after
the
revivalist
week
it
did
not
become
a
habit
with
him
he
explored
the
amazon
and
found
newly
exposed
by
the
fall
of
a
great
tree
a
rock
of
gold
engaged
in
these
pursuits
he
would
neglect
the
work
immediately
in
hand
sitting
somewhat
slackly
on
the
form
and
projecting
himself
in
a
manner
tempting
to
a
schoolmaster
with
a
cane
and
twice
he
had
books
confiscated
recalled
to
the
realities
of
life
he
would
rub
himself
or
sigh
deeply
as
the
occasion
required
and
resume
his
attempts
to
write
as
good
as
copperplate
he
hated
writing
the
ink
always
crept
up
his
fingers
and
the
smell
of
ink
offended
him
and
he
was
filled
with
unexpressed
doubts
should
writing
slope
down
from
right
to
left
should
downstrokes
be
thick
and
upstrokes
thin
should
the
handle
of
one
pen
point
over
one
right
shoulder
his
copy
books
towards
the
end
foreshadowed
his
destiny
and
took
the
form
of
commercial
documents
they
ran
to
your
esteemed
order
of
the
we
beg
to
inform
and
so
on
the
compression
of
polly
mind
and
soul
in
the
educational
institutions
of
his
time
was
terminated
abruptly
by
his
father
between
his
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
birthday
his
father
who
had
long
since
forgotten
the
time
when
his
son
little
limbs
seemed
to
have
come
straight
from
god
hand
and
when
he
had
kissed
five
minute
in
a
rapture
of
loving
tenderness
remarked
it
time
that
dratted
boy
did
something
for
a
living
and
a
month
or
so
later
polly
began
that
career
in
business
that
led
him
at
last
to
the
sole
proprietorship
of
a
bankrupt
shop
and
to
the
stile
on
which
he
was
sitting
iii
polly
was
not
naturally
interested
in
hosiery
and
outfitting
at
times
indeed
he
urged
himself
to
a
spurious
curiosity
about
that
trade
but
presently
something
more
congenial
came
along
and
checked
the
effort
he
was
apprenticed
in
one
of
those
large
rather
establishments
which
sell
everything
from
pianos
and
furniture
to
books
and
millinery
a
department
store
in
fact
the
port
burdock
drapery
bazaar
at
port
burdock
one
of
the
three
townships
that
are
grouped
around
the
port
burdock
naval
dockyards
there
he
remained
six
years
he
spent
most
of
the
time
inattentive
to
business
in
a
sort
of
uncomfortable
happiness
increasing
his
indigestion
on
the
whole
he
preferred
business
to
school
the
hours
were
longer
but
the
tension
was
not
nearly
so
great
the
place
was
better
aired
you
were
not
kept
in
for
no
reason
at
all
and
the
cane
was
not
employed
you
watched
the
growth
of
your
moustache
with
interest
and
impatience
and
mastered
the
beginnings
of
social
intercourse
you
talked
and
found
there
were
things
amusing
to
say
also
you
had
regular
pocket
money
and
a
voice
in
the
purchase
of
your
clothes
and
presently
a
small
salary
and
there
were
girls
and
friendship
in
the
retrospect
port
burdock
sparkled
with
the
facets
of
quite
a
cluster
of
remembered
jolly
times
did
save
much
money
though
said
mr
polly
the
first
apprentices
dormitory
was
a
long
bleak
room
with
six
beds
six
chests
of
drawers
and
looking
glasses
and
a
number
of
boxes
of
wood
or
tin
it
opened
into
a
still
longer
and
bleaker
room
of
eight
beds
and
this
into
a
third
apartment
with
yellow
grained
paper
and
american
cloth
tables
which
was
the
by
day
and
the
after
nine
here
polly
who
had
been
an
only
child
first
tasted
the
joys
of
social
intercourse
at
first
there
were
attempts
to
bully
him
on
account
of
his
refusal
to
consider
face
washing
a
diurnal
duty
but
two
fights
with
the
apprentices
next
above
him
established
a
useful
reputation
for
choler
and
the
presence
of
girl
apprentices
in
the
shop
somehow
raised
his
standard
of
cleanliness
to
a
more
acceptable
level
he
did
of
course
have
very
much
to
do
with
the
feminine
staff
in
his
department
but
he
spoke
to
them
casually
as
he
traversed
foreign
parts
of
the
bazaar
or
got
out
of
their
way
politely
or
helped
them
to
lift
down
heavy
boxes
and
on
such
occasions
he
felt
their
scrutiny
except
in
the
course
of
business
or
at
meal
times
the
men
and
women
of
the
establishment
had
very
little
opportunity
of
meeting
the
men
were
in
their
rooms
and
the
girls
in
theirs
yet
these
feminine
creatures
at
once
so
near
and
so
remote
affected
him
profoundly
he
would
watch
them
going
to
and
fro
and
marvel
secretly
at
the
beauty
of
their
hair
or
the
roundness
of
their
necks
or
the
warm
softness
of
their
cheeks
or
the
delicacy
of
their
hands
he
would
fall
into
passions
for
them
at
dinner
time
and
try
and
show
devotions
by
his
manner
of
passing
the
bread
and
margarine
at
tea
there
was
a
very
apprentice
in
the
adjacent
haberdashery
to
whom
he
said
every
morning
and
for
a
period
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
significant
event
in
his
day
when
she
said
i
hope
it
will
be
fine
he
felt
it
marked
an
epoch
he
had
had
no
sisters
and
was
innately
disposed
to
worship
womankind
but
he
did
not
betray
as
much
to
platt
and
parsons
to
platt
and
parsons
he
affected
an
attitude
of
seasoned
depravity
towards
womankind
platt
and
parsons
were
his
contemporary
apprentices
in
departments
of
the
drapery
shop
and
the
three
were
drawn
together
into
a
close
friendship
by
the
fact
that
all
their
names
began
with
they
decided
they
were
the
three
ps
and
went
about
together
of
an
evening
with
the
bearing
of
desperate
dogs
sometimes
when
they
had
money
they
went
into
public
houses
and
had
drinks
then
they
would
become
more
desperate
than
ever
and
walk
along
the
pavement
under
the
gas
lamps
arm
in
arm
singing
platt
had
a
good
tenor
voice
and
had
been
in
a
church
choir
and
so
he
led
the
singing
parsons
had
a
serviceable
bellow
which
roared
and
faded
and
roared
again
very
wonderfully
polly
share
was
an
extraordinary
lowing
noise
a
sort
of
flat
recitative
which
he
called
singing
seconds
they
would
have
sung
catches
if
they
had
known
how
to
do
it
but
as
it
was
they
sang
melancholy
music
hall
songs
about
dying
soldiers
and
the
old
folks
far
away
they
would
sometimes
go
into
the
quieter
residential
quarters
of
port
burdock
where
policemen
and
other
obstacles
were
infrequent
and
really
let
their
voices
soar
like
hawks
and
feel
very
happy
the
dogs
of
the
district
would
be
stirred
to
hopeless
emulation
and
would
keep
it
up
for
long
after
the
three
ps
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
night
one
jealous
brute
of
an
irish
terrier
made
a
gallant
attempt
to
bite
parsons
but
was
beaten
by
numbers
and
solidarity
the
three
ps
took
the
utmost
interest
in
each
other
and
found
no
other
company
so
good
they
talked
about
everything
in
the
world
and
would
go
on
talking
in
their
dormitory
after
the
gas
was
out
until
the
other
men
were
reduced
to
throwing
boots
they
skulked
from
their
departments
in
the
slack
hours
of
the
afternoon
to
gossip
in
the
of
the
warehouse
on
sundays
and
bank
holidays
they
went
for
long
walks
together
talking
platt
was
and
dark
and
disposed
to
undertones
and
mystery
and
a
curiosity
about
society
and
the
he
kept
himself
by
reading
a
penny
paper
of
infinite
suggestion
called
parsons
was
of
an
ampler
build
already
promising
fatness
with
curly
hair
and
a
lot
of
rolling
rollicking
curly
features
and
a
large
nose
he
had
a
great
memory
and
a
real
interest
in
literature
he
knew
great
portions
of
shakespeare
and
milton
by
heart
and
would
recite
them
at
the
slightest
provocation
he
read
everything
he
could
get
hold
of
and
if
he
liked
it
he
read
it
aloud
it
did
not
matter
who
else
liked
it
at
first
polly
was
disposed
to
be
suspicious
of
this
literature
but
was
carried
away
by
parsons
enthusiasm
the
three
ps
went
to
a
performance
of
romeo
and
juliet
at
the
port
burdock
theatre
royal
and
hung
over
the
gallery
fascinated
after
that
they
made
a
sort
of
password
of
do
you
bite
your
thumbs
at
us
sir
to
which
the
countersign
was
we
bite
our
thumbs
for
weeks
the
glory
of
shakespeare
verona
lit
polly
life
he
walked
as
though
he
carried
a
sword
at
his
side
and
swung
a
mantle
from
his
shoulders
he
went
through
the
grimy
streets
of
port
burdock
with
his
eye
on
the
first
floor
windows
looking
for
balconies
a
ladder
in
the
yard
flooded
his
mind
with
romantic
ideas
then
parsons
discovered
an
italian
writer
whose
name
polly
rendered
as
bocashieu
and
after
some
excursions
into
that
author
remains
the
talk
of
parsons
became
infested
with
the
word
and
polly
would
stand
in
front
of
his
hosiery
fixtures
trifling
with
paper
and
string
and
thinking
of
perennial
picnics
under
dark
olive
trees
in
the
everlasting
sunshine
of
italy
and
about
that
time
it
was
that
all
three
ps
adopted
collars
and
large
loose
artistic
silk
ties
which
they
tied
very
much
on
one
side
and
wore
with
an
air
of
defiance
and
a
certain
swashbuckling
carriage
and
then
came
the
glorious
revelation
of
that
great
frenchman
whom
polly
called
rabooloose
the
three
ps
thought
the
birth
feast
of
gargantua
the
most
glorious
piece
of
writing
in
the
world
and
i
am
not
certain
they
were
wrong
and
on
wet
sunday
evenings
where
there
was
danger
of
hymn
singing
they
would
get
parsons
to
read
it
aloud
towards
the
several
members
of
the
who
shared
the
dormitory
the
three
ps
always
maintained
a
sarcastic
and
defiant
attitude
we
got
a
perfect
right
to
do
what
we
like
in
our
corner
platt
maintained
you
do
what
you
like
in
yours
but
the
language
objected
morrison
the
improver
who
was
leading
a
profoundly
religious
life
under
great
difficulties
man
roared
parsons
why
it
sunday
is
the
time
for
literature
it
the
only
time
we
got
and
besides
the
horrors
of
religious
controversy
would
begin
polly
stuck
loyally
to
the
three
ps
but
in
the
secret
places
of
his
heart
he
was
torn
a
fire
of
conviction
burnt
in
morrison
eyes
and
spoke
in
his
urgent
persuasive
voice
he
lived
the
better
life
manifestly
chaste
in
word
and
deed
industrious
studiously
kindly
when
the
junior
apprentice
had
sore
feet
and
homesickness
morrison
washed
the
feet
and
comforted
the
heart
and
he
helped
other
men
to
get
through
with
their
work
when
he
might
have
gone
early
a
superhuman
thing
to
do
polly
was
secretly
a
little
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
this
man
and
the
power
of
the
spirit
that
was
in
him
he
felt
watched
platt
also
struggling
with
things
his
mind
could
not
contrive
to
reconcile
said
that
confounded
hypocrite
he
no
hypocrite
said
parsons
he
no
hypocrite
o
man
but
he
got
no
blessed
joy
de
vive
that
what
wrong
with
him
go
down
to
the
harbour
arms
and
see
some
of
those
blessed
old
captains
getting
drunk
short
of
sugar
o
man
said
polly
slapping
his
trouser
pocket
oh
on
said
parsons
always
do
it
on
tuppence
for
a
bitter
lem
me
get
my
pipe
on
said
platt
who
had
recently
taken
to
smoking
with
great
ferocity
then
i
with
you
pause
and
struggle
do
ram
it
down
o
man
said
parsons
watching
with
knitted
brows
do
ram
it
down
give
it
air
seen
my
stick
o
man
right
o
and
leaning
on
his
cane
he
composed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
sympathetic
patience
towards
platt
incendiary
efforts
iv
jolly
days
of
companionship
they
were
for
the
incipient
bankrupt
on
the
stile
to
look
back
upon
the
interminable
working
hours
of
the
bazaar
had
long
since
faded
from
his
memory
except
for
one
or
two
conspicuous
rows
and
one
or
two
larks
but
the
rare
sundays
and
holidays
shone
out
like
diamonds
among
pebbles
they
shone
with
the
mellow
splendour
of
evening
skies
reflected
in
calm
water
and
athwart
them
all
went
old
parsons
bellowing
an
interpretation
of
life
gesticulating
appreciating
and
making
appreciate
expounding
books
talking
of
that
mystery
of
his
the
joy
de
vive
there
were
some
particularly
splendid
walks
on
bank
holidays
the
three
ps
would
start
on
sunday
morning
early
and
find
a
room
in
some
modest
inn
and
talk
themselves
asleep
and
return
singing
through
the
night
or
having
an
argy
bargy
about
the
stars
on
monday
evening
they
would
come
over
the
hills
out
of
the
pleasant
english
in
which
they
had
wandered
and
see
port
burdock
spread
out
below
a
network
of
interlacing
street
lamps
and
shifting
tram
lights
against
the
black
immensity
of
the
harbour
waters
back
to
the
collar
o
man
parsons
would
say
there
is
no
satisfactory
plural
to
o
man
so
he
always
used
it
in
the
singular
do
mention
it
said
platt
and
once
they
got
a
boat
for
the
whole
summer
day
and
rowed
up
past
the
moored
ironclads
and
the
black
old
hulks
and
the
various
shipping
of
the
harbour
past
a
white
troopship
and
past
the
trim
front
and
the
ships
and
interesting
vistas
of
the
dockyard
to
the
shallow
channels
and
rocky
weedy
wildernesses
of
the
upper
harbour
and
parsons
and
polly
had
a
great
dispute
and
quarrel
that
day
as
to
how
far
a
big
gun
could
shoot
the
country
over
the
hills
behind
port
burdock
is
all
that
an
scarcely
disturbed
english
should
be
in
those
days
the
bicycle
was
still
rare
and
costly
and
the
motor
car
had
yet
to
come
and
stir
up
rural
serenities
the
three
ps
would
take
footpaths
haphazard
across
fields
and
plunge
into
unknown
winding
lanes
between
high
hedges
of
honeysuckle
and
dogrose
greatly
daring
they
would
follow
green
bridle
paths
through
primrose
studded
undergrowths
or
wander
waist
deep
in
the
bracken
of
beech
woods
about
twenty
miles
from
port
burdock
there
came
a
region
of
hop
gardens
and
hoast
crowned
farms
and
further
on
to
be
reached
only
by
cheap
tickets
at
bank
holiday
times
was
a
sterile
ridge
of
very
clean
roads
and
red
sand
pits
and
pines
and
gorse
and
heather
the
three
ps
could
not
afford
to
buy
bicycles
and
they
found
boots
the
greatest
item
of
their
skimpy
expenditure
they
threw
appearances
to
the
winds
at
last
and
got
workingmen
there
was
much
discussion
and
strong
feeling
over
this
step
in
the
dormitory
there
is
no
like
the
english
for
those
who
have
learnt
to
love
it
its
firm
yet
gentle
lines
of
hill
and
dale
its
ordered
confusion
of
features
its
deer
parks
and
downland
its
castles
and
stately
houses
its
hamlets
and
old
churches
its
farms
and
ricks
and
great
barns
and
ancient
trees
its
pools
and
ponds
and
shining
threads
of
rivers
its
hedgerows
its
orchards
and
woodland
patches
its
village
greens
and
kindly
inns
other
have
their
pleasant
aspects
but
none
such
variety
none
that
shine
so
steadfastly
throughout
the
year
picardy
is
pink
and
white
and
pleasant
in
the
blossom
time
burgundy
goes
on
with
its
sunshine
and
wide
hillsides
and
cramped
vineyards
a
beautiful
tune
repeated
and
repeated
italy
gives
salitas
and
wayside
chapels
and
chestnuts
and
olive
orchards
the
ardennes
has
its
woods
and
gorges
touraine
and
the
rhineland
the
wide
campagna
with
its
distant
apennines
and
the
neat
prosperities
and
mountain
backgrounds
of
south
germany
all
clamour
their
especial
merits
at
one
memory
and
there
are
the
hills
and
fields
of
virginia
like
an
england
grown
very
big
and
slovenly
the
woods
and
big
river
sweeps
of
pennsylvania
the
trim
new
england
landscape
a
little
bleak
and
rather
fine
like
the
new
england
mind
and
the
wide
rough
country
roads
and
hills
and
woodland
of
new
york
state
but
none
of
these
change
scene
and
character
in
three
miles
of
walking
nor
have
so
mellow
a
sunlight
nor
so
diversified
a
cloudland
nor
confess
the
perpetual
refreshment
of
the
strong
soft
winds
that
blow
from
off
the
sea
as
our
mother
england
does
it
was
good
for
the
three
ps
to
walk
through
such
a
land
and
forget
for
a
time
that
indeed
they
had
no
footing
in
it
all
that
they
were
doomed
to
toil
behind
counters
in
such
places
as
port
burdock
for
the
better
part
of
their
lives
they
would
forget
the
customers
and
shopwalkers
and
department
buyers
and
everything
and
become
just
happy
wanderers
in
a
world
of
pleasant
breezes
and
song
birds
and
shady
trees
the
arrival
at
the
inn
was
a
great
affair
no
one
they
were
convinced
would
take
them
for
drapers
and
there
might
be
a
pretty
serving
girl
or
a
jolly
old
lady
or
what
parsons
called
a
bit
of
character
drinking
in
the
bar
there
would
always
be
weighty
enquiries
as
to
what
they
could
have
and
it
would
work
out
always
at
cold
beef
and
pickles
or
fried
ham
and
eggs
and
shandygaff
two
pints
of
beer
and
two
bottles
of
ginger
beer
foaming
in
a
huge
jug
the
glorious
moment
of
standing
lordly
in
the
inn
doorway
and
staring
out
at
the
world
the
swinging
sign
the
geese
upon
the
green
the
a
waiting
waggon
the
church
tower
a
sleepy
cat
the
blue
heavens
with
the
sizzle
of
the
frying
audible
behind
one
the
keen
smell
of
the
bacon
the
trotting
of
feet
bearing
the
repast
the
click
and
clatter
as
the
tableware
is
finally
arranged
a
clean
white
cloth
ready
sir
or
ready
gentlemen
better
hearing
that
than
forward
polly
look
sharp
the
going
in
the
sitting
down
the
falling
to
bread
o
man
right
o
do
bag
all
the
crust
o
man
once
a
simple
mannered
girl
in
a
pink
print
dress
stayed
and
talked
with
them
as
they
ate
led
by
the
gallant
parsons
they
professed
to
be
all
desperately
in
love
with
her
and
courted
her
to
say
which
she
preferred
of
them
it
was
so
manifest
she
did
prefer
one
and
so
impossible
to
say
which
it
was
held
her
there
until
a
distant
maternal
voice
called
her
away
afterwards
as
they
left
the
inn
she
waylaid
them
at
the
orchard
corner
and
gave
them
a
little
shyly
three
keen
apples
and
wished
them
to
come
again
some
day
and
vanished
and
reappeared
looking
after
them
as
they
turned
the
corner
waving
a
white
handkerchief
all
the
rest
of
that
day
they
disputed
over
the
signs
of
her
favour
and
the
next
sunday
they
went
there
again
but
she
had
vanished
and
a
mother
of
forbidding
aspect
afforded
no
explanations
if
platt
and
parsons
and
polly
live
to
be
a
hundred
they
will
none
of
them
forget
that
girl
as
she
stood
with
a
pink
flush
upon
her
faintly
smiling
and
yet
earnest
parting
the
branches
of
the
hedgerows
and
reaching
down
apple
in
hand
which
of
them
was
it
had
caught
her
spirit
to
attend
to
them
and
once
they
went
along
the
coast
following
it
as
closely
as
possible
and
so
came
at
last
to
foxbourne
that
easternmost
suburb
of
brayling
and
foxbourne
seemed
a
very
jolly
little
place
to
polly
that
afternoon
it
has
a
clean
sandy
beach
instead
of
the
mud
and
pebbles
and
coaly
of
port
burdock
a
row
of
six
bathing
machines
and
a
shelter
on
the
parade
in
which
the
three
ps
sat
after
a
satisfying
but
rather
expensive
lunch
that
had
included
celery
rows
of
verandahed
villas
proffered
apartments
they
had
feasted
in
an
hotel
with
a
porch
painted
white
and
gay
with
geraniums
above
and
the
high
street
with
the
old
church
at
the
head
had
been
full
of
an
agreeable
afternoon
stillness
nice
little
place
for
business
said
platt
sagely
from
behind
his
big
pipe
it
stuck
in
polly
memory
v
polly
was
not
so
picturesque
a
youth
as
parsons
he
lacked
richness
in
his
voice
and
went
about
in
those
days
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
quietly
speculative
he
specialised
in
slang
and
the
disuse
of
english
and
he
played
the
rôle
of
an
appreciative
stimulant
to
parsons
words
attracted
him
curiously
words
rich
in
suggestion
and
he
loved
a
novel
and
striking
phrase
his
school
training
had
given
him
little
or
no
mastery
of
the
mysterious
pronunciation
of
english
and
no
confidence
in
himself
his
schoolmaster
indeed
had
been
both
unsound
and
variable
new
words
had
terror
and
fascination
for
him
he
did
not
acquire
them
he
could
not
avoid
them
and
so
he
plunged
into
them
his
only
rule
was
not
to
be
misled
by
the
spelling
that
was
no
guide
anyhow
he
avoided
every
recognised
phrase
in
the
language
and
mispronounced
everything
in
order
that
he
should
be
suspected
of
ignorance
but
whim
sesquippledan
he
would
say
sesquippledan
verboojuice
eh
said
platt
eloquent
rapsodooce
where
asked
platt
in
the
warehouse
o
man
all
among
the
and
blankets
carlyle
he
reading
aloud
doing
the
high
froth
spuming
windmilling
waw
waw
it
a
sight
worth
seeing
he
bark
his
blessed
knuckles
one
of
these
days
on
the
fixtures
o
man
he
held
an
imaginary
book
in
one
hand
and
waved
an
eloquent
gesture
so
too
shall
every
hero
inasmuch
as
notwithstanding
for
evermore
come
back
to
reality
he
parodied
the
enthusiastic
parsons
so
that
in
fashion
and
thereby
upon
things
and
not
things
articulariously
he
stands
i
should
laugh
if
the
governor
dropped
on
him
said
platt
never
hear
him
coming
the
o
man
drunk
with
it
fair
drunk
said
polly
i
never
did
it
worse
than
when
he
got
on
to
raboloose
chapter
the
second
the
dismissal
of
parsons
i
suddenly
parsons
got
himself
dismissed
he
got
himself
dismissed
under
circumstances
of
peculiar
violence
that
left
a
deep
impression
on
polly
mind
he
wondered
about
it
for
years
afterwards
trying
to
get
the
rights
of
the
case
parsons
apprenticeship
was
over
he
had
reached
the
status
of
an
improver
and
he
dressed
the
window
of
the
manchester
department
by
all
the
standards
available
he
dressed
it
very
well
by
his
own
standards
he
dressed
it
wonderfully
well
o
man
he
used
to
say
there
one
thing
about
my
position
here
i
dress
a
window
and
when
trouble
was
under
discussion
he
would
hold
that
little
fluffums
which
was
the
apprentices
name
for
garvace
the
senior
partner
and
managing
director
of
the
bazaar
would
think
twice
before
he
got
rid
of
the
only
man
in
the
place
who
could
make
a
windowful
of
manchester
goods
then
like
many
a
fellow
artist
he
fell
a
prey
to
theories
the
art
of
window
dressing
is
in
its
infancy
o
man
in
its
blooming
infancy
all
balance
and
stiffness
like
a
blessed
egyptian
picture
no
joy
in
it
no
blooming
joy
conventional
a
shop
window
ought
to
get
hold
of
people
as
they
go
along
it
stands
to
reason
grip
his
voice
would
sink
to
a
kind
of
quiet
bellow
they
grip
then
after
a
pause
a
savage
roar
he
got
a
heavy
on
said
polly
go
it
o
man
let
have
some
more
of
it
look
at
old
morrison
windows
tidy
tasteful
correct
i
grant
you
but
bleak
he
let
out
the
word
reinforced
to
a
shout
bleak
bleak
echoed
polly
just
pieces
of
stuff
in
rows
rows
of
tidy
little
puffs
perhaps
one
bit
just
unrolled
quiet
tickets
might
as
well
be
in
church
o
man
said
polly
a
window
ought
to
be
exciting
said
parsons
it
ought
to
make
you
say
when
you
see
it
he
paused
and
platt
watched
him
over
a
snorting
pipe
rockcockyo
said
polly
we
want
a
new
school
of
window
dressing
said
parsons
regardless
of
the
comment
a
new
school
the
port
burdock
school
day
after
i
change
the
fitzallan
street
stuff
this
time
it
going
to
be
a
change
i
mean
to
have
a
crowd
or
bust
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
both
his
voice
dropped
to
a
note
of
i
been
timid
man
i
been
holding
myself
in
i
have
done
myself
justice
kept
down
the
simmering
seething
teeming
ideas
all
that
over
now
over
gulped
polly
over
for
good
and
all
o
man
ii
platt
came
to
polly
who
was
sorting
up
collar
boxes
o
man
doing
his
blooming
window
what
window
what
he
said
polly
remembered
he
went
on
with
his
collar
boxes
with
his
eye
on
his
senior
mansfield
mansfield
was
presently
called
away
to
the
counting
house
and
instantly
polly
shot
out
by
the
street
door
and
made
a
rapid
transit
along
the
street
front
past
the
manchester
window
and
so
into
the
silkroom
door
he
could
not
linger
long
but
he
gathered
joy
a
swift
and
fearful
joy
from
his
brief
inspection
of
unconscious
back
parsons
had
his
tail
coat
off
and
was
working
with
vigour
his
habit
of
pulling
his
waistcoat
straps
to
the
utmost
brought
out
all
the
agreeable
promise
of
corpulence
in
his
youthful
frame
he
was
blowing
excitedly
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
then
moving
with
all
the
swift
eagerness
of
a
man
inspired
all
about
his
feet
and
knees
were
scarlet
blankets
not
folded
not
formally
unfolded
but
the
only
phrase
is
shied
about
and
a
great
bar
sinister
of
roller
towelling
stretched
across
the
front
of
the
window
on
which
was
a
ticket
and
the
ticket
said
in
bold
black
letters
look
so
soon
as
polly
got
into
the
silk
department
and
met
platt
he
knew
he
had
not
lingered
nearly
long
enough
outside
did
you
see
the
boards
at
the
back
said
platt
he
had
the
high
egrugious
is
fairly
on
he
said
and
dived
down
to
return
by
devious
subterranean
routes
to
the
outfitting
department
presently
the
street
door
opened
and
platt
with
an
air
of
intense
devotion
to
business
assumed
to
cover
his
adoption
of
that
unusual
route
came
in
and
made
for
the
staircase
down
to
the
warehouse
he
rolled
up
his
eyes
at
polly
oh
he
said
and
vanished
irresistible
curiosity
seized
polly
should
he
go
through
the
shop
to
the
manchester
department
or
risk
a
second
transit
outside
he
was
impelled
to
make
a
dive
at
the
street
door
where
are
you
going
asked
mansfield
lill
dog
said
polly
with
an
air
of
lucid
explanation
and
left
him
to
get
any
meaning
he
could
from
it
parsons
was
worth
the
subsequent
trouble
parsons
really
was
extremely
rich
this
time
polly
stopped
to
take
it
in
parsons
had
made
a
huge
symmetrical
pile
of
thick
white
and
red
blankets
twisted
and
rolled
to
accentuate
their
woolly
richness
heaped
up
in
a
warm
disorder
with
large
window
tickets
inscribed
in
blazing
red
letters
cosy
comfort
at
cut
prices
and
curl
up
and
cuddle
below
cost
regardless
of
the
daylight
he
had
turned
up
the
electric
light
on
that
side
of
the
window
to
reflect
a
warm
glow
upon
the
heap
and
behind
in
pursuit
of
contrasted
bleakness
he
was
now
hanging
long
strips
of
grey
silesia
and
chilly
coloured
linen
dusterings
it
was
wonderful
but
polly
decided
that
it
was
time
he
went
in
he
found
platt
in
the
silk
department
apparently
on
the
verge
of
another
plunge
into
the
exterior
world
cosy
comfort
at
cut
prices
said
polly
allittritions
artful
aid
he
did
not
dare
go
into
the
street
for
the
third
time
and
he
was
hovering
feverishly
near
the
window
when
he
saw
the
governor
garvace
that
is
to
say
the
managing
director
of
the
bazaar
walking
along
the
pavement
after
his
manner
to
assure
himself
all
was
well
with
the
establishment
he
guided
garvace
was
a
short
stout
man
with
that
air
of
modest
pride
that
so
often
goes
with
corpulence
choleric
and
decisive
in
manner
and
with
hands
that
looked
like
bunches
of
fingers
he
was
and
ruddy
and
after
the
custom
of
such
hairs
sprang
from
the
tip
of
his
nose
when
he
wished
to
bring
the
power
of
the
human
eye
to
bear
upon
an
assistant
he
projected
his
chest
knitted
one
brow
and
partially
closed
the
left
eyelid
an
expression
of
speculative
wonder
overspread
the
countenance
of
polly
he
felt
he
must
yes
whatever
happened
he
must
want
to
speak
to
parsons
sir
he
said
to
mansfield
and
deserted
his
post
hastily
dashed
through
the
intervening
departments
and
was
in
position
behind
a
pile
of
bolton
sheeting
as
the
governor
came
in
out
of
the
street
what
on
earth
do
you
think
you
are
doing
with
that
window
parsons
began
garvace
only
the
legs
of
parsons
and
the
lower
part
of
his
waistcoat
and
an
intervening
inch
of
shirt
were
visible
he
was
standing
inside
the
window
on
the
steps
hanging
up
the
last
strip
of
his
background
from
the
brass
rail
along
the
ceiling
within
the
manchester
shop
window
was
cut
off
by
a
partition
rather
like
the
partition
of
an
church
pew
from
the
general
space
of
the
shop
there
was
a
panelled
barrier
that
is
to
say
with
a
little
door
like
a
pew
door
in
it
parsons
face
appeared
staring
with
round
eyes
at
his
employer
garvace
had
to
repeat
his
question
dressing
it
sir
on
new
lines
come
out
of
it
said
garvace
parsons
stared
and
garvace
had
to
repeat
his
command
parsons
with
a
dazed
expression
began
to
descend
the
steps
slowly
garvace
turned
about
where
morrison
morrison
morrison
appeared
take
this
window
over
said
garvace
pointing
his
bunch
of
fingers
at
parsons
take
all
this
muddle
out
and
dress
it
properly
morrison
advanced
and
hesitated
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
parsons
with
an
immense
politeness
but
this
is
window
take
it
all
out
said
garvace
turning
away
morrison
advanced
parsons
shut
the
door
with
a
click
that
arrested
garvace
come
out
of
that
window
he
said
you
ca
dress
it
if
you
want
to
play
the
fool
with
a
window
this
window
all
right
said
the
genius
in
window
dressing
and
there
was
a
little
pause
open
the
door
and
go
right
in
said
garvace
to
morrison
you
leave
that
door
alone
morrison
said
parsons
polly
was
no
longer
even
trying
to
hide
behind
the
stack
of
bolton
sheetings
he
realised
he
was
in
the
presence
of
forces
too
stupendous
to
heed
him
get
him
out
said
garvace
morrison
seemed
to
be
thinking
out
the
ethics
of
his
position
the
idea
of
loyalty
to
his
employer
prevailed
with
him
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
door
to
open
it
parsons
tried
to
disengage
his
hand
garvace
joined
his
effort
to
morrison
then
the
heart
of
polly
leapt
and
the
world
blazed
up
to
wonder
and
splendour
parsons
disappeared
behind
the
partition
for
a
moment
and
reappeared
instantly
gripping
a
thin
cylinder
of
rolled
huckaback
with
this
he
smote
at
head
morrison
head
ducked
under
the
resounding
impact
but
he
clung
on
and
so
did
garvace
the
door
came
open
and
then
garvace
was
staggering
back
hand
to
head
his
autocratic
his
sacred
baldness
smitten
parsons
was
beyond
all
control
a
strangeness
a
marvel
heaven
knows
how
the
artistic
struggle
had
strained
that
richly
endowed
temperament
say
i
ca
dress
a
window
you
thundering
old
humbug
he
said
and
hurled
the
huckaback
at
his
master
he
followed
this
up
by
hurling
first
a
blanket
then
an
armful
of
silesia
then
a
window
support
out
of
the
window
into
the
shop
it
leapt
into
polly
mind
that
parsons
hated
his
own
effort
and
was
glad
to
demolish
it
for
a
crowded
second
polly
mind
was
concentrated
upon
parsons
infuriated
active
like
a
figure
of
earthquake
with
its
coat
off
shying
things
headlong
then
he
perceived
the
back
of
garvace
and
heard
his
gubernatorial
voice
crying
to
no
one
in
particular
and
everybody
in
general
get
him
out
of
the
window
he
mad
he
dangerous
get
him
out
of
the
window
then
a
crimson
blanket
was
for
a
moment
over
the
head
of
garvace
and
his
voice
muffled
for
an
instant
broke
out
into
unwonted
expletive
then
people
had
arrived
from
all
parts
of
the
bazaar
luck
the
ledger
clerk
blundered
against
polly
and
said
help
him
somerville
from
the
silks
vaulted
the
counter
and
seized
a
chair
by
the
back
polly
lost
his
head
he
clawed
at
the
bolton
sheeting
before
him
and
if
he
could
have
detached
a
piece
he
would
certainly
have
hit
somebody
with
it
as
it
was
he
simply
upset
the
pile
it
fell
away
from
polly
and
he
had
an
impression
of
somebody
squeaking
as
it
went
down
it
was
the
sort
of
impression
one
disregards
the
collapse
of
the
pile
of
goods
just
sufficed
to
end
his
subconscious
efforts
to
get
something
to
hit
somebody
with
and
his
whole
attention
focussed
itself
upon
the
struggle
in
the
window
for
a
splendid
instant
parsons
towered
up
over
the
active
backs
that
clustered
about
the
shop
window
door
an
active
whirl
of
gesture
tearing
things
down
and
throwing
them
and
then
he
went
under
there
was
an
instant
furious
struggle
a
crash
a
second
crash
and
the
crack
of
broken
plate
glass
then
a
stillness
and
heavy
breathing
parsons
was
overpowered
polly
stepping
over
scattered
pieces
of
bolton
sheeting
saw
his
transfigured
friend
with
a
dark
cut
that
was
not
at
present
bleeding
on
the
forehead
one
arm
held
by
somerville
and
the
other
by
morrison
you
you
you
you
annoyed
me
said
parsons
sobbing
for
breath
iii
there
are
events
that
detach
themselves
from
the
general
stream
of
occurrences
and
seem
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
revelations
such
was
this
parsons
affair
it
began
by
seeming
grotesque
it
ended
disconcertingly
the
fabric
of
polly
daily
life
was
torn
and
beneath
it
he
discovered
depths
and
terrors
life
was
not
altogether
a
lark
the
calling
in
of
a
policeman
seemed
at
the
moment
a
pantomime
touch
but
when
it
became
manifest
that
garvace
was
in
a
fury
of
vindictiveness
the
affair
took
on
a
different
complexion
the
way
in
which
the
policeman
made
a
note
of
everything
and
aspirated
nothing
impressed
the
sensitive
mind
of
polly
profoundly
polly
presently
found
himself
straightening
up
ties
to
the
refrain
of
then
you
on
the
and
in
the
dormitory
that
night
parsons
had
become
heroic
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
his
head
bandaged
packing
very
slowly
and
insisting
over
and
again
he
ought
to
have
left
my
window
alone
man
he
did
ought
to
have
touched
my
window
polly
was
to
go
to
the
police
court
in
the
morning
as
a
witness
the
terror
of
that
ordeal
almost
overshadowed
the
tragic
fact
that
parsons
was
not
only
summoned
for
assault
but
swapped
and
packing
his
box
polly
knew
himself
well
enough
to
know
he
would
make
a
bad
witness
he
felt
sure
of
one
fact
only
namely
that
then
on
the
and
all
the
rest
danced
about
in
his
mind
now
and
how
it
would
dance
about
on
the
morrow
heaven
only
knew
would
there
be
a
is
it
perjoocery
to
make
a
slip
people
did
sometimes
perjuice
themselves
serious
offence
platt
was
doing
his
best
to
help
parsons
and
inciting
public
opinion
against
morrison
but
parsons
would
not
hear
of
anything
against
morrison
he
was
all
right
o
man
according
to
his
lights
said
parsons
it
is
him
i
complain
of
he
speculated
on
the
morrow
i

to
pay
a
fine
he
said
no
good
trying
to
get
out
of
it
it
true
i
hit
him
i
hit
him
he
paused
and
seemed
to
be
seeking
an
exquisite
accuracy
his
voice
sank
to
a
confidential
note
on
the
head
about
here
he
answered
the
suggestion
of
a
bright
junior
apprentice
in
a
corner
of
the
dormitory
what
the
good
of
a
cross
summons
he
replied
with
old
corks
the
chemist
and
mottishead
the
house
agent
and
all
that
lot
on
the
bench
humble
pie
that
my
meal
o
man
humble
pie
packing
went
on
for
a
time
but
lord
what
a
life
it
is
said
parsons
giving
his
deep
notes
scope
a
man
trying
to
do
his
duty
mistaken
perhaps
but
trying
his
best
ruined
ruined
he
lifted
his
voice
to
a
shout
ruined
and
dropped
it
to
like
an
earthquake
heated
altaclation
said
polly
like
a
blooming
earthquake
said
parsons
with
the
notes
of
a
rising
wind
he
meditated
gloomily
upon
his
future
and
a
colder
chill
invaded
polly
mind
likely
to
get
another
crib
ai
i
with
assaulted
the
guvnor
on
my
reference
i
suppose
though
he
wo
give
me
refs
hard
enough
to
get
a
crib
at
the
best
of
times
said
parsons
you
ought
to
go
round
with
a
show
o
man
said
polly
things
were
not
so
dreadful
in
the
police
court
as
polly
had
expected
he
was
given
a
seat
with
other
witnesses
against
the
wall
of
the
court
and
after
an
interesting
larceny
case
parsons
appeared
and
stood
not
in
the
dock
but
at
the
table
by
that
time
legs
which
had
been
tucked
up
at
first
under
his
chair
out
of
respect
to
the
court
were
extended
straight
before
him
and
his
hands
were
in
his
trouser
pockets
he
was
inventing
names
for
the
four
magistrates
on
the
bench
and
had
got
to
the
grave
and
reverend
signor
with
the
palatial
boko
when
his
thoughts
were
recalled
to
gravity
by
the
sound
of
his
name
he
rose
with
alacrity
and
was
fielded
by
an
expert
policeman
from
a
brisk
attempt
to
get
into
the
vacant
dock
the
clerk
to
the
justices
repeated
the
oath
with
incredible
rapidity
right
o
said
polly
but
quite
respectfully
and
kissed
the
book
his
evidence
was
simple
and
quite
audible
after
one
warning
from
the
superintendent
of
police
to
speak
up
he
tried
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
parsons
by
saying
he
was
naturally
of
a
choleraic
disposition
but
the
start
and
the
slow
grin
of
enjoyment
upon
the
face
of
the
grave
and
reverend
signor
with
the
palatial
boko
suggested
that
the
word
was
not
so
good
as
he
had
thought
it
the
rest
of
the
bench
was
frankly
puzzled
and
there
were
hasty
consultations
you
mean
a
temper
said
the
presiding
magistrate
i
mean
a
temper
replied
polly
magically
incapable
of
aspirates
for
the
moment
you
do
mean
ketches
cholera
i
mean
he
easily
put
out
then
why
ca
you
say
so
said
the
presiding
magistrate
parsons
was
bound
over
he
came
for
his
luggage
while
every
one
was
in
the
shop
and
garvace
would
not
let
him
invade
the
business
to
say
when
polly
went
upstairs
for
margarine
and
bread
and
tea
he
slipped
on
into
the
dormitory
at
once
to
see
what
was
happening
further
in
the
parsons
case
but
parsons
had
vanished
there
was
no
parsons
no
trace
of
parsons
his
cubicle
was
swept
and
garnished
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
polly
had
a
sense
of
irreparable
loss
a
minute
or
so
after
platt
dashed
in
ugh
he
said
and
then
discovered
polly
polly
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
did
not
look
around
platt
went
up
to
him
he
gone
already
said
platt
might
have
stopped
to
say
to
a
chap
there
was
a
little
pause
before
polly
replied
he
thrust
his
finger
into
his
mouth
and
gulped
bit
on
that
beastly
tooth
of
mine
he
said
still
not
looking
at
platt
it
made
my
eyes
water
something
chronic
any
one
might
think
i
been
doing
a
blooming
pipe
by
the
look
of
me
chapter
the
third
cribs
i
port
burdock
was
never
the
same
place
for
polly
after
parsons
had
left
it
there
were
no
chest
notes
in
his
occasional
letters
and
little
of
the
joy
de
vive
got
through
by
them
parsons
had
gone
he
said
to
london
and
found
a
place
as
warehouseman
in
a
cheap
outfitting
shop
near
paul
churchyard
where
references
were
not
required
it
became
apparent
as
time
passed
that
new
interests
were
absorbing
him
he
wrote
of
socialism
and
the
rights
of
man
things
that
had
no
appeal
for
polly
he
felt
strangers
had
got
hold
of
his
parsons
were
at
work
upon
him
making
him
into
someone
else
something
less
picturesque
port
burdock
became
a
dreariness
full
of
faded
memories
of
parsons
and
work
a
bore
platt
revealed
himself
alone
as
a
tiresome
companion
obsessed
by
romantic
ideas
about
intrigues
and
vices
and
society
women
polly
depression
manifested
itself
in
a
general
slackness
a
certain
impatience
in
the
manner
of
garvace
presently
got
upon
his
nerves
relations
were
becoming
strained
he
asked
for
a
rise
of
salary
to
test
his
position
and
gave
notice
to
leave
when
it
was
refused
it
took
him
two
months
to
place
himself
in
another
situation
and
during
that
time
he
had
quite
a
disagreeable
amount
of
loneliness
disappointment
anxiety
and
humiliation
he
went
at
first
to
stay
with
a
married
cousin
who
had
a
house
at
easewood
his
widowed
father
had
recently
given
up
the
music
and
bicycle
shop
with
the
post
of
organist
at
the
parish
church
that
had
sustained
his
home
and
was
living
upon
a
small
annuity
as
a
guest
with
this
cousin
and
growing
a
little
tiresome
on
account
of
some
mysterious
internal
discomfort
that
the
local
practitioner
diagnosed
as
imagination
he
had
aged
with
mysterious
rapidity
and
become
excessively
irritable
but
the
cousin
wife
was
a
born
manager
and
contrived
to
get
along
with
him
our
polly
status
was
that
of
a
guest
pure
and
simple
but
after
a
fortnight
of
congested
hospitality
in
which
he
wrote
nearly
a
hundred
letters
beginning
to
your
advt
in
the
christian
world
for
an
improver
in
gents
outfitting
i
beg
to
submit
myself
for
the
situation
have
had
six
years
experience
and
upset
a
bottle
of
ink
over
a
toilet
cover
and
the
bedroom
carpet
his
cousin
took
him
for
a
walk
and
pointed
out
the
superior
advantages
of
apartments
in
london
from
which
to
swoop
upon
the
briefly
yawning
vacancy
helpful
said
polly
very
helpful
o
man
indeed
i
might
have
gone
on
there
for
weeks
and
packed
he
got
a
room
in
an
institution
that
was
partly
a
benevolent
hostel
for
men
in
his
circumstances
and
partly
a
high
minded
but
forbidding
coffee
house
and
a
centre
for
pleasant
sunday
afternoons
polly
spent
a
critical
but
pleasant
sunday
afternoon
in
a
back
seat
inventing
such
phrases
as
soulful
owner
of
the
exorbiant
largenial
development
an
apple
being
in
question
earnest
joy
exultant
urgent
loogoobuosity
a
manly
young
curate
marking
and
misunderstanding
his
preoccupied
face
and
moving
lips
came
and
sat
by
him
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
idea
of
making
him
feel
more
at
home
the
conversation
was
awkward
and
disconnected
for
a
minute
or
so
and
then
suddenly
a
memory
of
the
port
burdock
bazaar
occurred
to
polly
and
with
a
baffling
whisper
of
lill
dog
and
a
reassuring
nod
he
rose
up
and
escaped
to
wander
out
relieved
and
observant
into
the
varied
london
streets
he
found
the
collection
of
men
he
found
waiting
about
in
wholesale
establishments
in
wood
street
and
paul
churchyard
where
they
interview
the
buyers
who
have
come
up
from
the
country
interesting
and
stimulating
but
far
too
strongly
charged
with
the
suggestion
of
his
own
fate
to
be
really
joyful
there
were
men
in
all
degrees
between
confidence
and
distress
and
in
every
stage
between
extravagant
smartness
and
the
last
stages
of
decay
there
were
sunny
young
men
full
of
an
abounding
and
elbowing
energy
before
whom
the
soul
of
polly
sank
in
hate
and
dismay
smart
juniors
said
polly
to
himself
full
of
smart
juniosity
the
shoveacious
cult
there
were
hungry
looking
individuals
of
or
so
that
he
decided
must
be
proletelerians
he
had
often
wanted
to
find
someone
who
fitted
that
attractive
word
men
too
old
at
forty
discoursed
in
the
on
the
outlook
in
the
trade
it
had
never
been
so
bad
they
said
while
polly
wondered
if
was
a
permissible
epithet
there
were
men
with
an
overweening
sense
of
their
importance
manifestly
annoyed
and
angry
to
find
themselves
still
disengaged
and
inclined
to
suspect
a
plot
and
men
so
one
was
terrified
to
imagine
their
behaviour
when
it
came
to
an
interview
there
was
a
young
man
with
an
unintelligent
face
who
seemed
to
think
himself
equipped
against
the
world
beyond
all
misadventure
by
a
collar
of
exceptional
height
and
another
who
introduced
a
note
of
gaiety
by
wearing
a
flannel
shirt
and
a
check
suit
of
remarkable
virulence
every
day
polly
looked
round
to
mark
how
many
of
the
familiar
faces
had
gone
and
the
deepening
anxiety
reflecting
his
own
on
the
faces
that
remained
and
every
day
some
new
type
joined
the
drifting
shoal
he
realised
how
small
a
chance
his
poor
letter
from
easewood
ran
against
this
hungry
cluster
of
competitors
at
the
fountain
head
at
the
back
of
polly
mind
while
he
made
his
observations
was
a
disagreeable
flavour
of
dentist
parlour
at
any
moment
his
name
might
be
shouted
and
he
might
have
to
haul
himself
into
the
presence
of
some
fresh
specimen
of
employer
and
to
repeat
once
more
his
passionate
protestation
of
interest
in
the
business
his
possession
of
a
capacity
for
zeal
zeal
on
behalf
of
anyone
who
would
pay
him
a
yearly
salary
of
pounds
a
year
the
prospective
employer
would
unfold
his
ideals
of
the
employee
i
want
a
smart
willing
young
man
thoroughly
willing
who
wo
object
to
take
trouble
i
do
want
a
slacker
the
sort
of
fellow
who
has
to
be
pushed
up
to
his
work
and
held
there
i
got
no
use
for
him
at
the
back
of
polly
mind
and
quite
beyond
his
control
the
insubordinate
phrasemaker
would
be
proffering
such
combinations
as
chubby
chops
or
chubby
charmer
as
suitable
for
the
gentleman
very
much
as
a
hat
salesman
proffers
hats
i
do
think
you
find
much
slackness
about

said
polly
brightly
trying
to
disregard
his
deeper
self

man
who
means
getting
on
exactly
sir
excelsior
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
excelsior
sir
it
a
sort
of
motto
of
mine
from
longfellow
would
you
want
me
to
serve
through
the
chubby
gentleman
explained
and
reverted
to
his
ideals
with
a
faint
air
of
suspicion
do
mean
getting
on
he
asked
i
hope
so
sir
said
polly
get
on
or
get
out
eh
polly
made
a
rapturous
noise
nodded
appreciation
and
said
indistinctly
my
style
some
of
my
people
have
been
with
me
twenty
years
said
the
employer
my
manchester
buyer
came
to
me
as
a
boy
of
twelve
you
a
christian
church
of
england
said
polly
h
said
the
employer
a
little
checked
for
good
all
round
business
work
i
should
have
preferred
a
baptist
still
he
studied
polly
tie
which
was
severely
neat
and
businesslike
as
became
an
aspiring
outfitter
polly
conception
of
his
own
pose
and
expression
was
rendered
by
that
uncontrollable
phrasemonger
at
the
back
as
obsequies
deference
i
am
inclined
said
the
prospective
employer
in
a
conclusive
manner
to
look
up
your
reference
polly
stood
up
abruptly
thank
you
said
the
employer
and
dismissed
him
chump
chops
how
about
chump
chops
said
the
phrasemonger
with
an
air
of
inspiration
i
hope
then
to
hear
from
you
sir
said
polly
in
his
best
salesman
manner
if
everything
is
satisfactory
said
the
prospective
employer
ii
a
man
whose
brain
devotes
its
hinterland
to
making
odd
phrases
and
nicknames
out
of
words
whose
conception
of
life
is
a
lump
of
auriferous
rock
to
which
all
the
value
is
given
by
rare
veins
of
unbusinesslike
joy
who
reads
boccaccio
and
rabelais
and
shakespeare
with
gusto
and
uses
stertoraneous
shover
and
smart
junior
as
terms
of
bitterest
opprobrium
is
not
likely
to
make
a
great
success
under
modern
business
conditions
polly
dreamt
always
of
picturesque
and
mellow
things
and
had
an
instinctive
hatred
of
the
strenuous
life
he
would
have
resisted
the
spell
of
roosevelt
or
general
baden
powell
or
peter
keary
or
the
late
samuel
smiles
quite
easily
and
he
loved
falstaff
and
hudibras
and
coarse
laughter
and
the
old
england
of
washington
irving
and
the
memory
of
charles
the
second
courtly
days
his
progress
was
necessarily
slow
he
did
not
get
rises
he
lost
situations
there
was
something
in
his
eye
employers
did
not
like
he
would
have
lost
his
places
oftener
if
he
had
not
been
at
times
an
exceptionally
brilliant
salesman
rather
carefully
neat
and
a
slow
but
very
fair
he
went
from
situation
to
situation
he
invented
a
great
wealth
of
nicknames
he
conceived
enmities
and
made
friends
but
none
so
richly
satisfying
as
parsons
he
was
frequently
but
mildly
and
discursively
in
love
and
sometimes
he
thought
of
that
girl
who
had
given
him
a
apple
he
had
an
idea
amounting
to
a
flattering
certainty
whose
youthful
freshness
it
was
had
stirred
her
to
and
sometimes
he
thought
of
foxbourne
sleeping
prosperously
in
the
sun
and
he
began
to
have
moods
of
discomfort
and
lassitude
and
due
to
the
beginnings
of
indigestion
various
forces
and
suggestions
came
into
his
life
and
swayed
him
for
longer
and
shorter
periods
he
went
to
canterbury
and
came
under
the
influence
of
gothic
architecture
there
was
a
blood
affinity
between
polly
and
the
gothic
in
the
middle
ages
he
would
no
doubt
have
sat
upon
a
scaffolding
and
carved
out
penetrating
and
none
too
flattering
portraits
of
church
dignitaries
upon
the
capitals
and
when
he
strolled
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
along
the
cloisters
behind
the
cathedral
and
looked
at
the
rich
grass
plot
in
the
centre
he
had
the
strangest
sense
of
being
at
home
far
more
than
he
had
ever
been
at
home
before
portly
he
used
to
murmur
to
himself
under
the
impression
that
he
was
naming
a
characteristic
type
of
medieval
churchman
he
liked
to
sit
in
the
nave
during
the
service
and
look
through
the
great
gates
at
the
candles
and
choristers
and
listen
to
the
voices
but
the
transepts
he
never
penetrated
because
of
the
charge
for
admission
the
music
and
the
long
vista
of
the
fretted
roof
filled
him
with
a
vague
and
mystical
happiness
that
he
had
no
words
even
mispronounceable
words
to
express
but
some
of
the
smug
monuments
in
the
aisles
got
a
wreath
of
epithets
metrorious
urnfuls
funererial
claims
dejected
angelosity
for
example
he
wandered
about
the
precincts
and
speculated
about
the
people
who
lived
in
the
ripe
and
cosy
houses
of
grey
stone
that
cluster
there
so
comfortably
through
green
doors
in
high
stone
walls
he
caught
glimpses
of
level
lawns
and
blazing
flower
beds
mullioned
windows
revealed
shaded
reading
lamps
and
disciplined
shelves
of
brown
bound
books
now
and
then
a
dignitary
in
gaiters
would
pass
him
portly
capon
or
a
drift
of
choir
boys
cross
a
distant
arcade
and
vanish
in
a
doorway
or
the
pink
and
cream
of
some
girlish
dress
flit
like
a
butterfly
across
the
cool
still
spaces
of
the
place
particularly
he
responded
to
the
ruined
arches
of
the
infirmary
and
the
view
of
bell
harry
tower
from
the
school
buildings
he
was
stirred
to
read
the
canterbury
tales
but
he
could
not
get
on
with
chaucer
english
it
fatigued
his
attention
and
he
would
have
given
all
the
story
telling
very
readily
for
a
few
adventures
on
the
road
he
wanted
these
nice
people
to
live
more
and
yarn
less
he
liked
the
wife
of
bath
very
much
he
would
have
liked
to
have
known
that
woman
at
canterbury
too
he
first
to
his
knowledge
saw
americans
his
shop
did
a
good
class
trade
in
westgate
street
and
he
would
see
them
go
by
on
the
way
to
stare
at
chaucer
chequers
and
then
turn
down
mercery
lane
to
prior
goldstone
gate
it
impressed
him
that
they
were
always
in
a
kind
of
quiet
hurry
and
very
determined
and
methodical
people
much
more
so
than
any
english
he
knew
cultured
rapacicity
he
tried
vorocious
return
to
the
heritage
he
would
expound
them
incidentally
to
his
attendant
apprentices
he
had
overheard
a
little
lady
putting
her
view
to
a
friend
near
the
christchurch
gate
the
accent
and
intonation
had
hung
in
his
memory
and
he
would
reproduce
them
more
or
less
accurately
now
does
this
marlowe
monument
really
and
truly
he
had
heard
the
little
lady
enquire
we
no
time
for
side
shows
and
second
rate
stunts
mamie
we
want
just
the
big
simple
things
of
the
place
just
the
broad
elemental
canterbury
praposition
what
is
it
saying
to
us
i
want
to
get
right
hold
of
that
and
then
have
tea
in
the
very
room
that
chaucer
did
and
hustle
to
get
that
train
back
to
london
he
would
go
over
these
precious
phrases
finding
them
full
of
an
indescribable
flavour
just
the
broad
elemental
canterbury
praposition
he
would
repeat
he
would
try
to
imagine
parsons
confronted
with
americans
for
his
own
part
he
knew
himself
to
be
altogether
inadequate
canterbury
was
the
most
congenial
situation
polly
ever
found
during
these
wander
years
albeit
a
very
desert
so
far
as
companionship
went
iii
it
was
after
canterbury
that
the
universe
became
really
disagreeable
to
polly
it
was
brought
home
to
him
not
so
much
vividly
as
with
a
harsh
and
ungainly
insistence
that
he
was
a
failure
in
his
trade
it
was
not
the
trade
he
ought
to
have
chosen
though
what
trade
he
ought
to
have
chosen
was
by
no
means
clear
he
made
great
but
irregular
efforts
and
produced
a
forced
smartness
that
like
a
cheap
dye
refused
to
stand
sunshine
he
acquired
a
sort
of
parsimony
also
in
which
acquisition
he
was
helped
by
one
or
two
phases
of
absolute
impecuniosity
but
he
was
hopeless
in
competition
against
the
naturally
gifted
the
born
hustlers
the
young
men
who
meant
to
get
on
he
left
the
canterbury
place
very
regretfully
he
and
another
commercial
gentleman
took
a
boat
one
sunday
afternoon
at
when
the
wind
was
in
the
west
and
sailed
it
very
happily
eastward
for
an
hour
they
had
never
sailed
a
boat
before
and
it
seemed
simple
and
wonderful
when
they
turned
they
found
the
river
too
narrow
for
tacking
and
the
tide
running
out
like
a
sluice
they
battled
back
to
sturry
in
the
course
of
six
hours
at
a
shilling
the
first
hour
and
for
each
hour
afterwards
rowing
a
mile
in
an
hour
and
a
half
or
so
until
the
turn
of
the
tide
came
to
help
them
and
then
they
had
a
night
walk
to
canterbury
and
found
themselves
remorselessly
locked
out
the
canterbury
employer
was
an
amiable
man
and
he
would
probably
not
have
dismissed
polly
if
that
unfortunate
tendency
to
phrase
things
had
not
shocked
him
a
tide
a
tide
sir
said
polly
feeling
that
things
were
not
so
bad
i
no
power
to
alter
that
it
proved
impossible
to
explain
to
the
canterbury
employer
that
this
was
not
a
highly
disrespectful
and
blasphemous
remark
and
besides
what
good
are
you
to
me
this
morning
do
you
think
said
the
canterbury
employer
with
your
arms
pulled
out
of
their
sockets
so
polly
resumed
his
observations
in
the
wood
street
warehouses
once
more
and
had
some
dismal
times
the
shoal
of
fish
waiting
for
the
crumbs
of
employment
seemed
larger
than
ever
he
took
counsel
with
himself
should
he
chuck
the
outfitting
it
was
any
good
for
him
now
and
presently
when
he
was
older
and
his
youthful
smartness
had
passed
into
the
dulness
of
middle
age
it
would
be
worse
what
else
could
he
do
he
could
think
of
nothing
he
went
one
night
to
a
music
hall
and
developed
a
vague
idea
of
a
comic
performance
the
comic
men
seemed
violent
rowdies
and
not
at
all
funny
but
when
he
thought
of
the
great
pit
of
the
audience
yawning
before
him
he
realised
that
his
was
an
altogether
too
delicate
talent
for
such
a
use
he
was
impressed
by
the
charm
of
selling
vegetables
by
auction
in
one
of
those
open
shops
near
london
bridge
but
admitted
upon
reflection
his
general
want
of
technical
knowledge
he
made
some
enquiries
about
emigration
but
none
of
the
colonies
were
in
want
of
shop
assistants
without
capital
he
kept
up
his
attendance
in
wood
street
he
subdued
his
ideal
of
salary
by
the
sum
of
five
pounds
a
year
and
was
taken
at
that
into
a
driving
establishment
in
clapham
which
dealt
chiefly
in
suits
fed
its
assistants
in
an
underground
and
kept
them
until
twelve
on
saturdays
he
found
it
hard
to
be
cheerful
there
his
fits
of
indigestion
became
worse
and
he
began
to
lie
awake
at
night
and
think
sunshine
and
laughter
seemed
things
lost
for
ever
picnics
and
shouting
in
the
moonlight
the
chief
shopwalker
took
a
dislike
to
him
and
nagged
him
nar
then
polly
look
alive
polly
became
the
burthen
of
his
days
as
smart
a
chap
as
you
could
have
said
the
chief
shopwalker
but
no
no
no
what
the
matter
with
you
during
his
night
vigils
polly
had
a
feeling
a
young
rabbit
must
have
very
much
the
feeling
when
after
a
youth
of
gambolling
in
sunny
woods
and
furtive
jolly
raids
upon
the
growing
wheat
and
exciting
triumphant
bolts
before
ineffectual
casual
dogs
it
finds
itself
at
last
for
a
long
night
of
floundering
effort
and
perplexity
in
a
net
for
the
rest
of
its
life
he
could
not
grasp
what
was
wrong
with
him
he
made
enormous
efforts
to
diagnose
his
case
was
he
really
just
a
lazy
slacker
who
ought
to
buck
up
he
could
find
it
in
him
to
believe
it
he
blamed
his
father
a
good
deal
it
is
what
fathers
are
for
in
putting
him
to
a
trade
he
was
happy
to
follow
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
say
what
he
ought
to
have
followed
he
felt
there
had
been
something
stupid
about
his
school
but
just
where
that
came
in
he
could
say
he
made
some
perfectly
sincere
efforts
to
buck
up
and
shove
ruthlessly
but
that
was
infernal
impossible
he
had
to
admit
himself
miserable
with
all
the
misery
of
a
social
misfit
and
with
no
clear
prospect
of
more
than
the
most
incidental
happiness
ahead
of
him
and
for
all
his
attempts
at
or
he
felt
at
bottom
that
he
was
at
fault
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
elements
of
his
troubles
had
been
adequately
diagnosed
by
a
certain
spectacled
gentleman
living
at
highbury
wearing
a
gold
and
writing
for
the
most
part
in
the
beautiful
library
of
the
reform
club
this
gentleman
did
not
know
polly
personally
but
he
had
dealt
with
him
generally
as
one
of
those
units
that
abound
in
a
society
that
has
failed
to
develop
a
collective
intelligence
and
a
collective
will
for
order
commensurate
with
its
complexities
but
phrases
of
that
sort
had
no
appeal
for
polly
chapter
the
fourth
polly
an
orphan
i
then
a
great
change
was
brought
about
in
the
life
of
polly
by
the
death
of
his
father
his
father
had
died
suddenly
the
local
practitioner
still
clung
to
his
theory
that
it
was
imagination
he
suffered
from
but
compromised
in
the
certificate
with
the
appendicitis
that
was
then
so
fashionable
and
polly
found
himself
heir
to
a
debateable
number
of
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
house
of
his
cousin
near
easewood
junction
a
family
bible
an
engraved
portrait
of
garibaldi
and
a
bust
of
gladstone
an
invalid
gold
watch
a
gold
locket
formerly
belonging
to
his
mother
some
minor
jewelry
and
a
quantity
of
nearly
valueless
old
clothes
and
an
insurance
policy
and
money
in
the
bank
amounting
altogether
to
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
pounds
polly
had
always
regarded
his
father
as
an
immortal
as
an
eternal
fact
and
his
father
being
of
a
reserved
nature
in
his
declining
years
had
said
nothing
about
the
insurance
policy
both
wealth
and
bereavement
therefore
took
polly
by
surprise
and
found
him
a
little
inadequate
his
mother
death
had
been
a
childish
grief
and
long
forgotten
and
the
strongest
affection
in
his
life
had
been
for
parsons
an
only
child
of
sociable
tendencies
necessarily
turns
his
back
a
good
deal
upon
home
and
the
aunt
who
had
succeeded
his
mother
was
an
economist
and
furniture
polisher
a
knuckle
rapper
and
sharp
silencer
no
friend
for
a
slovenly
little
boy
he
had
loved
other
little
boys
and
girls
transitorily
none
had
been
frequent
and
familiar
enough
to
strike
deep
roots
in
his
heart
and
he
had
grown
up
with
a
tattered
and
dissipated
affectionateness
that
was
becoming
wildly
shy
his
father
had
always
been
a
stranger
an
irritable
stranger
with
exceptional
powers
of
intervention
and
comment
and
an
air
of
being
disappointed
about
his
offspring
it
was
shocking
to
lose
him
it
was
like
an
unexpected
hole
in
the
universe
and
the
writing
of
death
upon
the
sky
but
it
did
not
tear
polly
heartstrings
at
first
so
much
as
rouse
him
to
a
pitch
of
vivid
attention
he
came
down
to
the
cottage
at
easewood
in
response
to
an
urgent
telegram
and
found
his
father
already
dead
his
cousin
johnson
received
him
with
much
solemnity
and
ushered
him
upstairs
to
look
at
a
stiff
straight
shrouded
form
with
a
face
unwontedly
quiet
and
as
it
seemed
with
its
pinched
nostrils
scornful
looks
peaceful
said
polly
disregarding
the
scorn
to
the
best
of
his
ability
it
was
a
merciful
relief
said
johnson
there
was
a
pause
second
second
departed
i
ever
seen
not
counting
mummies
said
polly
feeling
it
necessary
to
say
something
we
did
all
we
could
no
doubt
of
it
o
man
said
polly
a
second
long
pause
followed
and
then
much
to
polly
great
relief
johnson
moved
towards
the
door
afterwards
polly
went
for
a
solitary
walk
in
the
evening
light
and
as
he
walked
suddenly
his
dead
father
became
real
to
him
he
thought
of
things
far
away
down
the
perspective
of
memory
of
jolly
moments
when
his
father
had
skylarked
with
a
wildly
excited
little
boy
of
a
certain
annual
visit
to
the
crystal
palace
pantomime
full
of
trivial
glittering
incidents
and
wonders
of
his
father
dread
back
while
customers
were
in
the
old
minutely
known
shop
it
is
curious
that
the
memory
which
seemed
to
link
him
nearest
to
the
dead
man
was
the
memory
of
a
fit
of
passion
his
father
had
wanted
to
get
a
small
sofa
up
the
narrow
winding
staircase
from
the
little
room
behind
the
shop
to
the
bedroom
above
and
it
had
jammed
for
a
time
his
father
had
coaxed
and
then
groaned
like
a
soul
in
torment
and
given
way
to
blind
fury
had
sworn
kicked
and
struck
at
the
offending
piece
of
furniture
and
finally
wrenched
it
upstairs
with
considerable
incidental
damage
to
lath
and
plaster
and
one
of
the
castors
that
moment
when
was
altogether
torn
aside
the
shocked
discovery
of
his
father
perfect
humanity
had
left
a
singular
impression
on
polly
queer
mind
it
was
as
if
something
extravagantly
vital
had
come
out
of
his
father
and
laid
a
warmly
passionate
hand
upon
his
heart
he
remembered
that
now
very
vividly
and
it
became
a
clue
to
endless
other
memories
that
had
else
been
dispersed
and
confusing
a
weakly
wilful
being
struggling
to
get
obdurate
things
round
impossible
corners
in
that
symbol
polly
could
recognise
himself
and
all
the
trouble
of
humanity
he
had
had
a
particularly
good
time
poor
old
chap
and
now
it
was
all
over
finished
johnson
was
the
sort
of
man
who
derives
great
satisfaction
from
a
funeral
a
melancholy
serious
man
of
five
and
thirty
with
great
powers
of
advice
he
was
the
ticket
clerk
at
easewood
junction
and
felt
the
responsibilities
of
his
position
he
was
naturally
thoughtful
and
reserved
and
greatly
sustained
in
that
by
an
innate
rectitude
of
body
and
an
overhanging
and
forward
inclination
of
the
upper
part
of
his
face
and
head
he
was
pale
but
freckled
and
his
dark
grey
eyes
were
deeply
set
his
lightest
interest
was
cricket
but
he
did
not
take
that
lightly
his
chief
holiday
was
to
go
to
a
cricket
match
which
he
did
as
if
he
was
going
to
church
and
he
watched
critically
applauded
sparingly
and
was
darkly
offended
by
any
unorthodox
play
his
convictions
upon
all
subjects
were
taciturnly
inflexible
he
was
an
obstinate
player
of
draughts
and
chess
and
an
earnest
and
persistent
reader
of
the
his
wife
was
a
pink
short
wilfully
smiling
managing
ingratiating
talkative
woman
who
was
determined
to
be
pleasant
and
take
a
bright
hopeful
view
of
everything
even
when
it
was
not
really
bright
and
hopeful
she
had
large
blue
expressive
eyes
and
a
round
face
and
she
always
spoke
of
her
husband
as
harold
she
addressed
sympathetic
and
considerate
remarks
about
the
deceased
to
polly
in
notes
of
brisk
encouragement
he
was
really
quite
cheerful
at
the
end
she
said
several
times
with
congratulatory
gusto
quite
cheerful
she
made
dying
seem
almost
agreeable
both
these
people
were
resolved
to
treat
polly
very
well
and
to
help
his
exceptional
incompetence
in
every
possible
way
and
after
a
simple
supper
of
ham
and
bread
and
cheese
and
pickles
and
cold
apple
tart
and
small
beer
had
been
cleared
away
they
put
him
into
the
armchair
almost
as
though
he
was
an
invalid
and
sat
on
chairs
that
made
them
look
down
on
him
and
opened
a
directive
discussion
of
the
arrangements
for
the
funeral
after
all
a
funeral
is
a
distinct
social
opportunity
and
rare
when
you
have
no
family
and
few
relations
and
they
did
not
want
to
see
it
spoilt
and
wasted
you
have
a
hearse
of
course
said
johnson
not
one
of
them
combinations
with
the
driver
sitting
on
the
coffin
disrespectful
i
think
they
are
i
ca
fancy
how
people
can
bring
themselves
to
be
buried
in
combinations
she
flattened
her
voice
in
a
manner
she
used
to
intimate
aesthetic
feeling
i
like
them
glass
hearses
she
said
so
refined
and
nice
they
are
podger
hearse
you
have
said
johnson
conclusively
it
the
best
in
easewood
everything
that
right
and
proper
said
polly
podger
ready
to
come
and
measure
at
any
time
said
johnson
then
you
want
a
mourner
carriage
or
two
according
as
to
whom
you
going
to
invite
said
johnson
did
think
of
inviting
any
one
said
polly
oh
you
to
ask
a
few
friends
said
johnson
you
let
your
father
go
to
his
grave
without
asking
a
few
friends
funerial
baked
meats
like
said
polly
not
baked
but
of
course
you
have
to
give
them
something
ham
and
chicken
very
suitable
you
do
want
a
lot
of
cooking
with
the
ceremony
coming
into
the
middle
of
it
i
wonder
who
alfred
ought
to
invite
harold
just
the
immediate
relations
one
does
want
a
great
crowd
of
people
and
one
does
want
not
to
show
respect
but
he
hated
our
relations
most
of
them
he
not
hating
them
said
johnson
you
may
be
sure
of
that
it
just
because
of
that
i
think
they
ought
to
come
all
of
them
even
your
aunt
mildred
bit
vulturial
is
it
said
polly
unheeded
would
be
more
than
twelve
or
thirteen
people
if
they
came
said
johnson
we
could
have
everything
put
out
ready
in
the
back
room
and
the
gloves
and
whiskey
in
the
front
room
and
while
we
were
all
at
the
ceremony
bessie
could
bring
it
all
into
the
front
room
on
a
tray
and
put
it
out
nice
and
proper
there
have
to
be
whiskey
and
sherry
or
port
for
the
ladies
where
you
get
your
mourning
asked
johnson
abruptly
polly
had
not
yet
considered
this
of
sorrow
thought
of
it
yet
o
man
a
disagreeable
feeling
spread
over
his
body
as
though
he
was
blackening
as
he
sat
he
hated
black
garments
i
suppose
i
must
have
mourning
he
said
well
said
johnson
with
a
solemn
smile
got
to
see
it
through
said
polly
indistinctly
if
i
were
you
said
johnson
i
should
get
trousers
that
all
you
really
want
and
a
black
satin
tie
and
a
top
hat
with
a
deep
mourning
band
and
gloves
jet
cuff
links
he
ought
to
have
as
chief
mourner
said
johnson
not
obligatory
said
johnson
it
shows
respect
said
johnson
it
shows
respect
of
course
said
johnson
and
then
johnson
went
on
with
the
utmost
gusto
to
the
details
of
the
casket
while
polly
sat
more
and
more
deeply
and
droopingly
into
the
armchair
assenting
with
a
note
of
protest
to
all
they
said
after
he
had
retired
for
the
night
he
remained
for
a
long
time
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
sofa
which
was
his
bed
staring
at
the
prospect
before
him
chasing
the
o
man
about
up
to
the
last
he
said
he
hated
the
thought
and
elaboration
of
death
as
a
healthy
animal
must
hate
it
his
mind
struggled
with
unwonted
social
problems
got
to
put
away
somehow
i
suppose
said
polly
wish
i
looked
him
up
a
bit
more
while
he
was
alive
said
polly
ii
bereavement
came
to
polly
before
the
realisation
of
opulence
and
its
anxieties
and
responsibilities
that
only
dawned
upon
him
on
the
morrow
which
chanced
to
be
sunday
as
he
walked
with
johnson
before
church
time
about
the
tangle
of
struggling
building
enterprise
that
constituted
the
rising
urban
district
of
easewood
johnson
was
off
duty
that
morning
and
devoted
the
time
very
generously
to
the
admonitory
discussion
of
polly
worldly
outlook
do
seem
to
get
the
hang
of
the
business
somehow
said
polly
too
much
blooming
humbug
in
it
for
my
way
of
thinking
if
i
were
you
said
johnson
i
should
push
for
a
place
in
london
take
almost
nothing
and
live
on
my
reserves
what
i
should
do
come
the
heavy
said
polly
get
a
better
class
reference
there
was
a
pause
think
of
investing
your
money
asked
johnson
hardly
got
used
to
the
idea
of
having
it
yet
o
man
you
have
to
do
something
with
it
give
you
nearly
twenty
pounds
a
year
if
you
invest
it
properly
have
seen
it
yet
in
that
light
said
polly
defensively
there
no
end
of
things
you
could
put
it
into
it
getting
it
out
again
i
should
feel
sure
of
i
no
sort
of
fiancianier
sooner
back
horses
i
would
do
that
if
i
were
you
not
my
style
o
man
it
a
nest
egg
said
johnson
polly
made
an
indeterminate
noise
there
building
societies
johnson
threw
out
in
a
speculative
tone
polly
with
detached
brevity
admitted
there
were
you
might
lend
it
on
mortgage
said
johnson
very
safe
form
of
investment
sha
think
anything
about
it
not
till
the
o
man
underground
said
polly
with
an
inspiration
they
turned
a
corner
that
led
towards
the
junction
might
do
worse
said
johnson
than
put
it
into
a
small
shop
at
the
moment
this
remark
made
very
little
appeal
to
polly
but
afterwards
it
developed
it
fell
into
his
mind
like
some
small
obscure
seed
and
germinated
these
shops
are
in
a
bad
position
said
johnson
the
row
he
referred
to
gaped
in
the
late
painful
stage
in
building
before
the
healing
touch
of
the
plasterer
assuages
the
roughness
of
the
brickwork
the
space
for
the
shop
yawned
an
oblong
gap
below
framed
above
by
an
iron
girder
windows
and
fittings
to
suit
tenant
a
board
at
the
end
of
the
row
promised
and
behind
was
the
door
space
and
a
glimpse
of
stairs
going
up
to
the
living
rooms
above
not
a
bad
position
said
johnson
and
led
the
way
into
the
establishment
room
for
fixtures
there
he
said
pointing
to
the
blank
wall
the
two
men
went
upstairs
to
the
little
or
best
bedroom
it
would
have
to
be
above
the
shop
then
they
descended
to
the
kitchen
below
rooms
in
a
new
house
always
look
a
bit
small
said
johnson
they
came
out
of
the
house
again
by
the
prospective
back
door
and
picked
their
way
through
builder
litter
across
the
yard
space
to
the
road
again
they
drew
nearer
the
junction
to
where
a
pavement
and
shops
already
open
and
active
formed
the
commercial
centre
of
easewood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
the
side
door
of
a
flourishing
little
establishment
opened
and
a
man
and
his
wife
and
a
little
boy
in
a
sailor
suit
came
into
the
street
the
wife
was
a
pretty
woman
in
brown
with
a
floriferous
straw
hat
and
the
group
was
altogether
very
sundayfied
and
shiny
and
spick
and
span
the
shop
itself
had
a
large
window
whose
contents
were
now
veiled
by
a
buff
blind
on
which
was
inscribed
in
scrolly
letters
rymer
pork
butcher
and
provision
merchant
and
then
with
voluptuous
elaboration
the
easewood
sausage
greetings
were
exchanged
between
johnson
and
this
distinguished
comestible
off
to
church
already
said
johnson
walking
across
the
fields
to
little
dorington
said
rymer
very
pleasant
walk
said
johnson
very
said
rymer
hope
you
enjoy
it
said
johnson
that
chap
done
well
said
johnson
as
they
went
on
came
here
with
nothing
practically
four
years
ago
and
as
thin
as
a
lath
look
at
him
now
he
worked
hard
of
course
said
johnson
improving
the
occasion
thought
fell
between
the
cousins
for
a
space
some
men
can
do
one
thing
said
johnson
and
some
another
for
a
man
who
sticks
to
it
there
a
lot
to
be
done
in
a
shop
iii
all
the
preparations
for
the
funeral
ran
easily
and
happily
under
johnson
skilful
hands
on
the
eve
of
the
sad
event
she
produced
a
reserve
of
black
sateen
the
kitchen
steps
and
a
box
of
and
decorated
the
house
with
festoons
and
bows
of
black
in
the
best
possible
taste
she
tied
up
the
knocker
with
black
crape
and
put
a
large
bow
over
the
corner
of
the
steel
engraving
of
garibaldi
and
swathed
the
bust
of
gladstone
that
had
belonged
to
the
deceased
with
inky
swathings
she
turned
the
two
vases
that
had
views
of
tivoli
and
the
bay
of
naples
round
so
that
these
rather
brilliant
landscapes
were
hidden
and
only
the
plain
blue
enamel
showed
and
she
anticipated
the
purchase
of
a
tablecloth
for
the
front
room
and
substituted
a
violet
purple
cover
for
the
now
very
worn
and
faded
raptures
and
roses
in
plushette
that
had
hitherto
done
duty
there
everything
that
loving
consideration
could
do
to
impart
a
dignified
solemnity
to
her
little
home
was
done
she
had
released
polly
from
the
irksome
duty
of
issuing
invitations
and
as
the
moments
of
assembly
drew
near
she
sent
him
and
johnson
out
into
the
narrow
long
strip
of
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
to
be
free
to
put
a
finishing
touch
or
so
to
her
preparations
she
sent
them
out
together
because
she
had
a
queer
little
persuasion
at
the
back
of
her
mind
that
polly
wanted
to
bolt
from
his
sacred
duties
and
there
was
no
way
out
of
the
garden
except
through
the
house
johnson
was
a
steady
successful
gardener
and
particularly
good
with
celery
and
peas
he
walked
slowly
along
the
narrow
path
down
the
centre
pointing
out
to
polly
a
number
of
interesting
points
in
the
management
of
peas
wrinkles
neatly
applied
and
difficulties
wisely
overcome
and
all
that
he
did
for
the
comfort
and
propitiation
of
that
fitful
but
rewarding
vegetable
presently
a
sound
of
nervous
laughter
and
raised
voices
from
the
house
proclaimed
the
arrival
of
the
earlier
guests
and
the
worst
of
that
anticipatory
tension
was
over
when
polly
the
house
he
found
three
entirely
strange
young
women
with
pink
faces
demonstrative
manners
and
emphatic
mourning
engaged
in
an
incoherent
conversation
with
johnson
all
three
kissed
him
with
great
gusto
after
the
ancient
english
fashion
these
are
your
cousins
larkins
said
johnson
that
annie
unexpected
hug
and
smack
that
miriam
resolute
hug
and
smack
and
that
minnie
prolonged
hug
and
smack
said
polly
emerging
a
little
crumpled
and
breathless
from
this
hearty
introduction
i
see
here
aunt
larkins
said
johnson
as
an
elderly
and
stouter
edition
of
the
three
young
women
appeared
in
the
doorway
polly
backed
rather
but
aunt
larkins
was
not
to
be
denied
having
hugged
and
kissed
her
nephew
resoundingly
she
gripped
him
by
the
wrists
and
scanned
his
features
she
had
a
round
sentimental
freckled
face
i
should
known
anywhere
she
said
with
fervour
hark
at
mother
said
the
cousin
called
annie
why
she
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
i
should
known
anywhere
said
larkins
for
child
you
got
her
eyes
it
a
resemblance
and
as
for
seeing
i
him
miss
imperence
i
dandled
him
you
could
dandle
him
now
ma
miss
annie
remarked
with
a
shriek
of
laughter
all
the
sisters
laughed
at
that
the
things
you
say
annie
said
miriam
and
for
a
time
the
room
was
full
of
mirth
polly
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
say
something
dandling
days
are
over
he
said
the
reception
of
this
remark
would
have
convinced
a
far
more
modest
character
than
polly
that
it
was
extremely
witty
polly
followed
it
up
by
another
one
almost
equally
good
my
turn
to
dandle
he
said
with
a
sly
look
at
his
aunt
and
convulsed
everyone
not
me
said
larkins
taking
his
point
you
and
achieved
a
climax
it
was
queer
but
they
seemed
to
be
easy
people
to
get
on
with
anyhow
they
were
still
picking
little
ripples
and
giggles
of
mirth
from
the
idea
of
polly
dandling
aunt
larkins
when
johnson
who
had
answered
the
door
ushered
in
a
stooping
figure
who
was
at
once
hailed
by
johnson
as
why
uncle
pentstemon
uncle
pentstemon
was
rather
a
shock
his
was
an
aged
rather
than
venerable
figure
time
had
removed
the
hair
from
the
top
of
his
head
and
distributed
a
small
dividend
of
the
plunder
in
little
bunches
carelessly
and
impartially
over
the
rest
of
his
features
he
was
dressed
in
a
very
big
old
frock
coat
and
a
long
cylindrical
top
hat
which
he
had
kept
on
he
was
very
much
bent
and
he
carried
a
rush
basket
from
which
protruded
coy
intimations
of
the
lettuces
and
onions
he
had
brought
to
grace
the
occasion
he
hobbled
into
the
room
resisting
the
efforts
of
johnson
to
divest
him
of
his
various
encumbrances
halted
and
surveyed
the
company
with
an
expression
of
profound
hostility
breathing
hard
recognition
quickened
in
his
eyes
here
he
said
to
aunt
larkins
and
then
you
be
these
your
gals
they
are
said
aunt
larkins
and
better
gals
that
annie
asked
uncle
pentstemon
pointing
a
horny
fancy
your
remembering
her
name
she
mucked
up
my
mushroom
bed
the
baggage
said
uncle
pentstemon
ungenially
and
i
give
it
to
her
to
rights
trounced
her
i
did
fairly
i
remember
her
here
some
green
stuff
for
you
grace
fresh
it
is
and
wholesome
i
shall
be
wanting
the
basket
back
and
mind
you
let
me
have
it
have
you
nailed
him
down
yet
you
always
was
a
bit
in
front
of
what
was
needful
his
attention
was
drawn
inward
by
a
troublesome
tooth
and
he
sucked
at
it
spitefully
there
was
something
potent
about
this
old
man
that
silenced
everyone
for
a
moment
or
so
he
seemed
a
fragment
from
the
ruder
agricultural
past
of
our
race
like
a
lump
of
soil
among
things
of
paper
he
put
his
basket
of
vegetables
very
deliberately
on
the
new
violet
tablecloth
removed
his
hat
carefully
and
dabbled
his
brow
and
wiped
out
his
hat
brim
with
a
crimson
and
yellow
pocket
handkerchief
i
glad
you
were
able
to
come
uncle
said
johnson
oh
i
said
uncle
pentstemon
i
he
turned
on
larkins
gals
in
service
he
asked
they
are
and
they
wo
be
said
larkins
no
he
said
with
infinite
meaning
and
turned
his
eye
on
polly
you
lizzie
boy
he
said
polly
was
spared
much
by
the
tumult
occasioned
by
further
arrivals
ah
here
may
punt
said
johnson
and
a
small
woman
dressed
in
the
borrowed
mourning
of
a
large
woman
and
leading
a
very
small
observant
little
boy
it
was
his
first
funeral
appeared
closely
followed
by
several
friends
of
johnson
who
had
come
to
swell
the
display
of
respect
and
made
only
vague
confused
impressions
upon
polly
mind
aunt
mildred
who
was
an
unexplained
family
scandal
had
declined
johnson
hospitality
everybody
was
in
profound
mourning
of
course
mourning
in
the
modern
english
style
with
the
dyer
handiwork
only
too
apparent
and
hats
and
jackets
of
the
current
cut
there
was
very
little
crape
and
the
costumes
had
none
of
the
goodness
and
specialisation
and
genuine
enjoyment
of
mourning
for
mourning
sake
that
a
similar
continental
gathering
would
have
displayed
still
that
congestion
of
strangers
in
black
sufficed
to
stun
and
confuse
polly
impressionable
mind
it
seemed
to
him
much
more
extraordinary
than
anything
he
had
expected
now
gals
said
larkins
see
if
you
can
help
and
the
three
daughters
became
confusingly
active
between
the
front
room
and
the
back
i
hope
everyone
take
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
said
johnson
we
do
stand
on
ceremony
and
a
decanter
appeared
in
the
place
of
uncle
pentstemon
vegetables
uncle
pentstemon
had
refused
to
be
relieved
of
his
hat
he
sat
stiffly
down
on
a
chair
against
the
wall
with
that
venerable
headdress
between
his
feet
watching
the
approach
of
anyone
jealously
do
you
go
squashing
my
hat
he
said
conversation
became
confused
and
general
uncle
pentstemon
addressed
himself
to
polly
you
a
little
chap
he
said
a
puny
little
chap
i
never
did
agree
to
lizzie
marrying
him
but
i
suppose
must
be
bygones
now
i
suppose
they
made
you
a
clerk
or
something
outfitter
said
polly
i
remember
them
girls
pretend
to
be
dressmakers
they
dressmakers
said
larkins
across
the
room
i
take
a
glass
of
sherry
they
to
it
you
see
he
took
the
glass
johnson
handed
him
and
poised
it
critically
between
a
horny
finger
and
thumb
you
be
paying
for
this
he
said
to
polly
here
you
do
you
go
treading
on
my
hat
young
woman
you
brush
your
skirts
against
it
and
you
take
a
off
its
value
it
ai
the
sort
of
you
see
nowadays
he
drank
noisily
the
sherry
presently
loosened
everybody
tongue
and
the
early
coldness
passed
there
ought
to
have
been
a
polly
heard
punt
remarking
to
one
of
johnson
friends
and
miriam
and
another
were
lost
in
admiration
of
johnson
decorations
so
very
nice
and
refined
they
were
both
repeating
at
intervals
the
sherry
and
biscuits
were
still
being
discussed
when
podger
the
undertaker
arrived
a
broad
cheerfully
sorrowful
little
man
accompanied
by
a
assistant
he
conversed
for
a
time
with
johnson
in
the
passage
outside
the
sense
of
his
business
stilled
the
rising
waves
of
chatter
and
carried
off
everyone
attention
in
the
wake
of
his
heavy
footsteps
to
the
room
above
iv
things
crowded
upon
polly
everyone
he
noticed
took
sherry
with
a
solemn
avidity
and
a
small
portion
even
was
administered
sacramentally
to
the
punt
boy
there
followed
a
distribution
of
black
kid
gloves
and
much
trying
on
and
humouring
of
fingers
gloves
said
one
of
johnson
friends
there
a
little
pair
there
for
willie
said
johnson
triumphantly
everyone
seemed
gravely
content
with
the
amazing
procedure
of
the
occasion
presently
podger
was
picking
polly
out
as
chief
mourner
to
go
with
johnson
larkins
and
annie
in
the
first
mourning
carriage
right
o
said
polly
and
repented
instantly
of
the
alacrity
of
the
phrase
there
have
to
be
a
walking
party
said
johnson
cheerfully
there
only
two
coaches
i
daresay
we
can
put
in
six
in
each
but
that
leaves
three
over
there
was
a
generous
struggle
to
be
pedestrian
and
the
two
other
larkins
girls
confessing
coyly
to
tight
new
boots
and
displaying
a
certain
eagerness
were
added
to
the
contents
of
the
first
carriage
it
be
a
squeeze
said
annie
do
mind
a
squeeze
said
polly
he
decided
privately
that
the
proper
phrase
for
the
result
of
that
remark
was
hysterial
catechunations
podger
the
room
from
a
momentary
supervision
of
the
bumping
business
that
was
now
proceeding
down
the
staircase
bearing
up
he
said
cheerfully
rubbing
his
hands
together
bearing
up
that
stuck
very
vividly
in
polly
mind
and
so
did
the
drive
to
the
churchyard
bunched
in
between
two
young
women
in
confused
dull
and
shiny
black
and
the
fact
that
the
wind
was
bleak
and
that
the
officiating
clergyman
had
a
cold
and
sniffed
between
his
sentences
the
wonder
of
life
the
wonder
of
everything
what
had
he
expected
that
this
should
all
be
so
astoundingly
different
he
found
his
attention
converging
more
and
more
upon
the
larkins
cousins
the
interest
was
reciprocal
they
watched
him
with
a
kind
of
suppressed
excitement
and
became
risible
with
his
every
word
and
gesture
he
was
more
and
more
aware
of
their
personal
quality
annie
had
blue
eyes
and
a
red
attractive
mouth
a
harsh
voice
and
a
habit
of
extreme
liveliness
that
even
this
occasion
could
not
suppress
minnie
was
fond
extremely
free
about
the
touching
of
hands
and
suchlike
endearments
miriam
was
quieter
and
regarded
him
earnestly
larkins
was
very
happy
in
her
daughters
and
they
had
the
naïve
affectionateness
of
those
who
see
few
people
and
find
a
strange
cousin
a
wonderful
outlet
polly
had
never
been
very
much
kissed
and
it
made
his
mind
swim
he
did
not
know
for
the
life
of
him
whether
he
liked
or
disliked
all
or
any
of
the
larkins
cousins
it
was
rather
attractive
to
make
them
laugh
they
laughed
at
anything
there
they
were
tugging
at
his
mind
and
the
funeral
tugging
at
his
mind
too
and
the
sense
of
himself
as
chief
mourner
in
a
brand
new
silk
hat
with
a
broad
mourning
band
he
watched
the
ceremony
and
missed
his
responses
and
strange
feelings
twisted
at
his
heartstrings
v
polly
walked
back
to
the
house
because
he
wanted
to
be
alone
miriam
and
minnie
would
have
accompanied
him
but
finding
uncle
pentstemon
beside
the
chief
mourner
they
went
on
in
front
you
wise
said
uncle
pentstemon
glad
you
think
so
said
polly
rousing
himself
to
talk
i
likes
a
bit
of
walking
before
a
meal
said
uncle
pentstemon
and
made
a
kind
of
large
hiccup
that
sherry
rises
he
remarked
grocer
stuff
i
expect
he
went
on
to
ask
how
much
the
funeral
might
be
costing
and
seemed
pleased
to
find
polly
did
know
in
that
case
he
said
impressively
it
pretty
certain
to
cost
you
expect
my
boy
he
meditated
for
a
time
i
seen
a
mort
of
undertakers
he
declared
a
mort
of
undertakers
the
larkins
girls
attracted
his
attention
let
lodgin
and
chars
he
commented
leastways
she
goes
out
to
cook
dinners
and
look
at
dressed
up
to
the
nines
if
it
ai
borryd
clothes
that
is
and
they
goes
out
to
work
at
a
factory
did
you
know
my
father
much
uncle
pentstemon
asked
polly
could
stand
lizzie
throwin
herself
away
like
that
said
uncle
pentstemon
and
repeated
his
hiccup
on
a
larger
scale
that
good
sherry
said
uncle
pentstemon
with
the
first
note
of
pathos
polly
had
detected
in
his
quavering
voice
the
funeral
in
the
rather
cold
wind
had
proved
wonderfully
appetising
and
every
eye
brightened
at
the
sight
of
the
cold
collation
that
was
now
spread
in
the
front
room
johnson
was
very
brisk
and
polly
when
he
the
house
found
everybody
sitting
down
come
along
alfred
cried
the
hostess
cheerfully
we
ca
very
well
begin
without
you
have
you
got
the
bottled
beer
ready
to
open
betsy
uncle
you
have
a
drop
of
whiskey
i
expect
put
it
where
i
can
mix
for
myself
said
uncle
pentstemon
placing
his
hat
very
carefully
out
of
harm
way
on
the
bookcase
there
were
two
cold
boiled
chickens
which
johnson
carved
with
great
care
and
justice
and
a
nice
piece
of
ham
some
brawn
and
a
steak
and
kidney
pie
a
large
bowl
of
salad
and
several
sorts
of
pickles
and
afterwards
came
cold
apple
tart
jam
roll
and
a
good
piece
of
stilton
cheese
lots
of
bottled
beer
some
lemonade
for
the
ladies
and
milk
for
master
punt
a
very
bright
and
satisfying
meal
polly
found
himself
seated
between
punt
who
was
much
preoccupied
with
master
punt
table
manners
and
one
of
johnson
school
friends
who
was
exchanging
reminiscences
of
school
days
and
news
of
how
various
common
friends
had
changed
and
married
with
johnson
opposite
him
was
miriam
and
another
of
the
johnson
circle
and
also
he
had
brawn
to
carve
and
there
was
hardly
room
for
the
helpful
betsy
to
pass
behind
his
chair
so
that
altogether
his
mind
would
have
been
amply
distracted
from
any
mortuary
broodings
even
if
a
wordy
warfare
about
the
education
of
the
modern
young
woman
had
not
sprung
up
between
uncle
pentstemon
and
larkins
and
threatened
for
a
time
in
spite
of
a
word
or
so
in
season
from
johnson
to
wreck
all
the
harmony
of
the
sad
occasion
the
general
effect
was
after
this
fashion
first
an
impression
of
punt

the
right

in
a
refined
undertone

an

of

profoundly

a
little
disheartened
and
then
they

they
found

alf
you
are
very
busy
with
that
brawn
up
there
and
so
on
for
the
hour
the
general
effect
upon
polly
at
the
time
was
at
once
confusing
and
exhilarating
but
it
led
him
to
eat
copiously
and
carelessly
and
long
before
the
end
when
after
an
hour
and
a
quarter
a
movement
took
the
party
and
it
pushed
away
its
cheese
plates
and
rose
sighing
and
stretching
from
the
remains
of
the
repast
little
streaks
and
bands
of
dyspeptic
irritation
and
melancholy
were
darkening
the
serenity
of
his
mind
he
stood
between
the
mantel
shelf
and
the
window
the
blinds
were
up
now
and
the
larkins
sisters
clustered
about
him
he
battled
with
the
oncoming
depression
and
forced
himself
to
be
extremely
facetious
about
two
noticeable
rings
on
annie
hand
they
ai
real
said
annie
coquettishly
got
out
of
a
prize
packet
prize
packet
in
trousers
i
expect
said
polly
and
awakened
inextinguishable
laughter
oh
the
things
you
say
said
minnie
slapping
his
shoulder
suddenly
something
he
had
quite
extraordinarily
forgotten
came
into
his
head
bless
my
heart
he
cried
suddenly
serious
what
the
matter
asked
johnson
ought
to
have
gone
back
to
shop
three
days
ago
they
make
no
end
of
a
row
lor
you
a
treat
said
cousin
annie
and
screamed
with
laughter
at
a
delicious
idea
you
get
the
chuck
she
said
polly
made
a
convulsing
grimace
at
her
i
die
she
said
i
do
believe
you
care
a
bit
feeling
a
little
disorganized
by
her
hilarity
and
a
shocked
expression
that
had
come
to
the
face
of
cousin
miriam
he
made
some
indistinct
excuse
and
went
out
through
the
back
room
and
scullery
into
the
little
garden
the
cool
air
and
a
very
slight
drizzle
of
rain
was
a
relief
anyhow
but
the
black
mood
of
the
replete
dyspeptic
had
come
upon
him
his
soul
darkened
hopelessly
he
walked
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
down
the
path
between
the
rows
of
exceptionally
cultured
peas
and
unreasonably
overwhelmingly
he
was
smitten
by
sorrow
for
his
father
the
heady
noise
and
muddle
and
confused
excitement
of
the
feast
passed
from
him
like
a
curtain
drawn
away
he
thought
of
that
hot
and
angry
and
struggling
creature
who
had
tugged
and
sworn
so
foolishly
at
the
sofa
upon
the
twisted
staircase
and
who
was
now
lying
still
and
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
a
oblong
pit
beside
the
heaped
gravel
that
would
presently
cover
him
the
stillness
of
it
the
wonder
of
it
the
infinite
reproach
hatred
for
all
these
people
all
of
them
possessed
polly
soul
gigglers
said
polly
he
went
down
to
the
fence
and
stood
with
his
hands
on
it
staring
away
at
nothing
he
stayed
there
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
from
the
house
came
a
sound
of
raised
voices
that
subsided
and
then
johnson
calling
for
bessie
gowlish
gusto
said
polly
jumping
it
in
funererial
games
do
hurt
of
course
does
matter
to
nobody
missed
polly
for
a
long
time
when
at
last
he
reappeared
among
them
his
eye
was
almost
grim
but
nobody
noticed
his
eye
they
were
looking
at
watches
and
johnson
was
being
omniscient
about
trains
they
seemed
to
discover
polly
afresh
just
at
the
moment
of
parting
and
said
a
number
of
more
or
less
appropriate
things
but
uncle
pentstemon
was
far
too
worried
about
his
rush
basket
which
had
been
carelessly
mislaid
he
seemed
to
think
with
larcenous
intentions
to
remember
polly
at
all
johnson
had
tried
to
fob
him
off
with
a
similar
but
inferior
basket
his
own
had
one
handle
mended
with
string
according
to
a
method
of
peculiar
virtue
and
inimitable
distinction
known
only
to
himself
and
the
old
gentleman
had
taken
her
attempt
as
the
gravest
reflection
upon
his
years
and
intelligence
polly
was
left
very
largely
to
the
larkins
trio
cousin
minnie
became
shameless
and
kept
kissing
him
and
then
finding
out
it
was
time
to
go
cousin
miriam
seemed
to
think
her
silly
and
caught
polly
eye
sympathetically
cousin
annie
ceased
to
giggle
and
lapsed
into
a
nearly
sentimental
state
she
said
with
real
feeling
that
she
had
enjoyed
the
funeral
more
than
words
could
tell
chapter
the
fifth
polly
takes
a
vacation
i
polly
returned
to
clapham
from
the
funeral
celebration
prepared
for
trouble
and
took
his
dismissal
in
a
manly
spirit
you
merely
me
by
a
hair
he
said
politely
and
he
told
them
in
the
dormitory
that
he
meant
to
take
a
little
holiday
before
his
next
crib
though
a
certain
inherited
reticence
suppressed
the
fact
of
the
legacy
you
do
that
all
right
said
ascough
the
head
of
the
boot
shop
it
quite
the
fashion
just
at
present
six
weeks
in
wonderful
wood
street
they
running
excursions
a
little
holiday
that
was
the
form
his
sense
of
wealth
took
first
that
it
made
a
little
holiday
possible
holidays
were
his
life
and
the
rest
merely
adulterated
living
and
now
he
might
take
a
little
holiday
and
have
money
for
railway
fares
and
money
for
meals
and
money
for
inns
but
he
wanted
someone
to
take
the
holiday
with
for
a
time
he
cherished
a
design
of
hunting
up
parsons
getting
him
to
throw
up
his
situation
and
going
with
him
to
and
shrewsbury
and
the
welsh
mountains
and
the
wye
and
a
lot
of
places
like
that
for
a
really
gorgeous
careless
illimitable
old
holiday
of
a
month
but
alas
parsons
had
gone
from
the
paul
churchyard
outfitter
long
ago
and
left
no
address
polly
tried
to
think
he
would
be
almost
as
happy
wandering
alone
but
he
knew
better
he
had
dreamt
of
casual
encounters
with
delightfully
interesting
people
by
the
wayside
even
romantic
encounters
such
things
happened
in
chaucer
and
bocashiew
they
happened
with
extreme
facility
in
richard
le
gallienne
very
detrimental
book
quest
of
the
golden
which
he
had
read
at
canterbury
but
he
had
no
confidence
they
would
happen
in
england
to
him
when
a
month
later
he
came
out
of
the
clapham
side
door
at
last
into
the
bright
sunshine
of
a
fine
london
day
with
a
dazzling
sense
of
limitless
freedom
upon
him
he
did
nothing
more
adventurous
than
order
the
cabman
to
drive
to
waterloo
and
there
take
a
ticket
for
easewood
he
wanted
what
he
want
most
in
life
i
think
his
distinctive
craving
is
best
expressed
as
fun
fun
in
companionship
he
had
already
spent
a
pound
or
two
upon
three
select
feasts
to
his
fellow
assistants
sprat
suppers
they
were
and
there
had
been
a
great
and
very
successful
sunday
pilgrimage
to
richmond
by
wandsworth
and
wimbledon
open
common
a
trailing
garrulous
company
walking
about
a
solemnly
happy
host
to
wonderful
cold
meat
and
salad
at
the
roebuck
a
bowl
of
punch
punch
and
a
bill
to
correspond
but
now
it
was
a
weekday
and
he
went
down
to
easewood
with
his
bag
and
portmanteau
in
a
solitary
compartment
and
looked
out
of
the
window
upon
a
world
in
which
every
possible
congenial
seemed
either
toiling
in
a
situation
or
else
looking
for
one
with
a
gnawing
and
hopelessly
preoccupying
anxiety
he
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
exploitation
roads
of
suburbs
and
rows
of
houses
all
very
much
alike
either
emphatically
and
impatiently
or
full
of
rather
busy
unsocial
people
near
wimbledon
he
had
a
glimpse
of
golf
links
and
saw
two
elderly
gentlemen
who
had
they
chosen
might
have
been
gentlemen
of
grace
and
leisure
addressing
themselves
to
smite
little
hunted
white
balls
great
distances
with
the
utmost
bitterness
and
dexterity
polly
could
not
understand
them
every
road
he
remarked
as
freshly
as
though
he
had
never
observed
it
before
was
bordered
by
inflexible
palings
or
iron
fences
or
severely
disciplined
hedges
he
wondered
if
perhaps
abroad
there
might
be
beautifully
careless
unenclosed
high
roads
perhaps
after
all
the
best
way
of
taking
a
holiday
is
to
go
abroad
he
was
haunted
by
the
memory
of
what
was
either
a
picture
or
a
dream
a
carriage
was
drawn
up
by
the
wayside
and
four
beautiful
people
two
men
and
two
women
graciously
dressed
were
dancing
a
formal
ceremonious
dance
full
of
bows
and
curtseys
to
the
music
of
a
wandering
fiddler
they
had
encountered
they
had
been
driving
one
way
and
he
walking
another
a
happy
encounter
with
this
obvious
result
they
might
have
come
straight
out
of
happy
theleme
whose
motto
is
do
what
thou
wilt
the
driver
had
taken
his
two
sleek
horses
out
they
grazed
unchallenged
and
he
sat
on
a
stone
clapping
time
with
his
hands
while
the
fiddler
played
the
shade
of
the
trees
did
not
altogether
shut
out
the
sunshine
the
grass
in
the
wood
was
lush
and
full
of
still
daffodils
the
turf
they
danced
on
was
starred
with
daisies
polly
dear
heart
firmly
believed
that
things
like
that
could
and
did
happen
somewhere
only
it
puzzled
him
that
morning
that
he
never
saw
them
happening
perhaps
they
happened
south
of
guilford
perhaps
they
happened
in
italy
perhaps
they
ceased
to
happen
a
hundred
years
ago
perhaps
they
happened
just
round
the
corner
on
weekdays
when
all
good
pollys
are
safely
shut
up
in
shops
and
so
dreaming
of
delightful
impossibilities
until
his
heart
ached
for
them
he
was
rattled
along
in
the
suburban
train
to
johnson
discreet
home
and
the
briskly
stimulating
welcome
of
johnson
ii
polly
translated
his
restless
craving
for
joy
and
leisure
into
harold
johnsonese
by
saying
that
he
meant
to
look
about
him
for
a
bit
before
going
into
another
situation
it
was
a
decision
johnson
very
warmly
approved
it
was
arranged
that
polly
should
occupy
his
former
room
and
board
with
the
johnsons
in
consideration
of
a
weekly
payment
of
eighteen
shillings
and
the
next
morning
polly
went
out
early
and
reappeared
with
a
purchase
a
safety
bicycle
which
he
proposed
to
study
and
master
in
the
sandy
lane
below
the
house
but
over
the
struggles
that
preceded
his
mastery
it
is
humane
to
draw
a
veil
and
also
polly
bought
a
number
of
books
rabelais
for
his
own
and
the
arabian
nights
the
works
of
sterne
a
pile
of
tales
from
blackwood
cheap
in
a
bookshop
the
plays
of
william
shakespeare
a
copy
of
belloc
road
to
rome
an
odd
volume
of
purchas
his
pilgrimes
and
the
life
and
death
of
jason
better
get
yourself
a
good
book
on
bookkeeping
said
johnson
turning
over
perplexing
pages
a
belated
spring
was
now
advancing
with
great
strides
to
make
up
for
lost
time
sunshine
and
a
stirring
wind
were
poured
out
over
the
land
fleets
of
towering
clouds
sailed
upon
urgent
tremendous
missions
across
the
blue
seas
of
heaven
and
presently
polly
was
riding
a
little
unstably
along
unfamiliar
surrey
roads
wondering
always
what
was
round
the
next
corner
and
marking
the
blackthorn
and
looking
out
for
the
first
white
of
the
may
he
was
perplexed
and
distressed
as
indeed
are
all
right
thinking
souls
that
there
is
no
may
in
early
may
he
did
not
ride
at
the
even
pace
sensible
people
use
who
have
marked
out
a
journey
from
one
place
to
another
and
settled
what
time
it
will
take
them
he
rode
at
variable
speeds
and
always
as
though
he
was
looking
for
something
that
missing
left
life
attractive
still
but
a
little
wanting
in
significance
and
sometimes
he
was
so
unreasonably
happy
he
had
to
whistle
and
sing
and
sometimes
he
was
incredibly
but
not
at
all
painfully
sad
his
indigestion
vanished
with
air
and
exercise
and
it
was
quite
pleasant
in
the
evening
to
stroll
about
the
garden
with
johnson
and
discuss
plans
for
the
future
johnson
was
full
of
ideas
moreover
polly
had
marked
the
road
that
led
to
stamton
that
rising
populous
suburb
and
as
his
bicycle
legs
grew
strong
his
wheel
with
a
sort
of
inevitableness
carried
him
towards
the
row
of
houses
in
a
back
street
in
which
his
larkins
cousins
made
their
home
together
he
was
received
with
great
enthusiasm
the
street
was
a
dingy
little
street
a
of
very
small
houses
in
a
row
each
with
an
almost
flattened
bow
window
and
a
blistered
brown
door
with
a
black
knocker
he
poised
his
bright
new
bicycle
against
the
window
and
knocked
and
stood
waiting
and
felt
himself
in
his
straw
hat
and
black
serge
suit
a
very
pleasant
and
figure
the
door
was
opened
by
cousin
miriam
she
was
wearing
a
bluish
print
dress
that
brought
out
a
kind
of
sallow
warmth
in
her
skin
and
although
it
was
nearly
four
in
the
afternoon
her
sleeves
were
tucked
up
as
if
for
some
domestic
work
above
the
elbows
showing
her
rather
slender
but
very
shapely
yellowish
arms
the
loosely
pinned
bodice
confessed
a
delicately
rounded
neck
for
a
moment
she
regarded
him
with
suspicion
and
a
faint
hostility
and
then
recognition
dawned
in
her
eyes
why
she
said
it
cousin
elfrid
thought
i
look
you
up
he
said
fancy
you
coming
to
see
us
like
this
she
answered
they
stood
confronting
one
another
for
a
moment
while
miriam
collected
herself
for
the
unexpected
emergency
explorations
menanderings
said
polly
indicating
the
bicycle
miriam
face
betrayed
no
appreciation
of
the
remark
wait
a
moment
she
said
coming
to
a
rapid
decision
and
i
tell
ma
she
closed
the
door
on
him
abruptly
leaving
him
a
little
surprised
in
the
street
ma
he
heard
her
calling
and
swift
speech
followed
the
import
of
which
he
did
catch
then
she
reappeared
it
seemed
but
an
instant
but
she
was
changed
the
arms
had
vanished
into
sleeves
the
apron
had
gone
a
certain
pleasing
disorder
of
the
hair
had
been
at
least
reproved
i
did
mean
to
shut
you
out
she
said
coming
out
upon
the
step
i
just
told
ma
how
are
you
elfrid
you
looking
well
i
know
you
rode
a
bicycle
is
it
a
new
one
she
leaned
upon
his
bicycle
bright
it
is
she
said
what
a
trouble
you
must
have
to
keep
it
clean
polly
was
aware
of
a
rustling
transit
along
the
passage
and
of
the
house
suddenly
full
of
hushed
but
strenuous
movement
it
plated
mostly
said
polly
what
do
you
carry
in
that
little
bag
thing
she
asked
and
then
branched
off
to
we
all
in
a
mess
you
know
it
my
cleaning
up
day
i
not
a
bit
tidy
i
know
but
i
like
to
a
go
in
at
things
now
and
then
you
got
to
take
us
as
you
find
us
elfrid
mercy
we
was
all
out
she
paused
she
was
talking
against
time
i
glad
to
see
you
again
she
repeated
could
keep
away
said
polly
gallantly
had
to
come
over
and
see
my
pretty
cousins
again
miriam
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
she
coloured
deeply
you
things
she
said
she
stared
at
polly
and
his
unfortunate
sense
of
fitness
made
him
nod
his
head
towards
her
regard
her
firmly
with
a
round
brown
eye
and
add
impressively
i
do
say
of
them
her
answering
expression
made
him
realise
for
an
instant
the
terrible
dangers
he
trifled
with
avidity
flared
up
in
her
eyes
minnie
voice
came
happily
to
dissolve
the
situation
elfrid
she
said
from
the
doorstep
her
hair
was
just
passably
tidy
and
she
was
a
little
effaced
by
a
red
blouse
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
genuine
brightness
of
her
welcome
he
was
to
come
in
to
tea
and
larkins
exuberantly
genial
in
a
floriferous
but
dingy
flannel
dressing
gown
appeared
to
confirm
that
he
brought
in
his
bicycle
and
put
it
in
the
narrow
empty
passage
and
everyone
crowded
into
a
small
untidy
kitchen
whose
table
had
been
hastily
cleared
of
the
of
the
midday
repast
you
must
come
in
said
larkins
for
miriam
turning
out
the
front
room
i
never
did
see
such
a
girl
for
cleanin
up
a
scrub
you
caught
us
on
the
as
the
sayin
is
but
welcome
all
the
same
pity
annie
at
work
she
wo
be
till
seven
miriam
put
chairs
and
attended
to
the
fire
minnie
edged
up
to
polly
and
said
i
glad
to
see
you
again
elfrid
with
a
warm
contiguous
intimacy
that
betrayed
a
broken
tooth
larkins
got
out
tea
things
and
descanted
on
the
noble
simplicity
of
their
lives
and
how
he
must
mind
our
simple
ways
they
enveloped
polly
with
a
geniality
that
intoxicated
his
amiable
nature
he
insisted
upon
helping
lay
the
things
and
created
enormous
laughter
by
pretending
not
to
know
where
plates
and
knives
and
cups
ought
to
go
who
i
going
to
sit
next
he
said
and
developed
voluminous
amusement
by
attempts
to
arrange
the
plates
so
that
he
could
rub
elbows
with
all
three
larkins

by
the

clock
which
was
dark
with

and
not
going
to
laugh
at
her
ease
at
his
perplexity
they
got
seated
at
last
and
polly
struck
a
vein
of
humour
in
telling
them
how
he
learnt
to
ride
the
bicycle
he
found
the
mere
repetition
of
the
word
wabble
sufficient
to
produce
almost
inextinguishable
mirth
no
foreseeing
little
accidentulous
misadventures

well
what
happened
to
the
old
man
with

can
said
larkins
we
sat
about
among
the
debreece
and
had
a
bit
of
an
argument
i
told
him
he
ought
to
come
out
wearing
such
a
dangerous
hat
flying
at
things
said
if
he
could
control
his
hat
he
ought
to
leave
it
at

high
old
jawbacious
argument
we
had
i
tell

tell

infuriacious
but
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
constantly
happening
you
know
on
a

people
run
into
you
hens
and
cats
and
dogs
and
things
everything
seems
to
have
its
mark
on
you
everything
never
run
into
anything
never
swelpme
said
polly
very
solemnly
never
say
squealed
minnie
hark
at
and
relapsed
into
a
condition
that
urgently
demanded
back
thumping
do
be
so
silly
said
miriam
thumping
hard
polly
had
never
been
such
a
social
success
before
they
hung
upon
his
every
word
and
laughed
what
a
family
they
were
for
laughter
and
he
loved
laughter
the
background
he
apprehended
dimly
it
was
very
much
the
sort
of
background
his
life
had
always
had
there
was
a
threadbare
tablecloth
on
the
table
and
the
slop
basin
and
teapot
did
not
go
with
the
cups
and
saucers
the
plates
were
different
again
the
knives
worn
down
the
butter
lived
in
a
greenish
glass
dish
of
its
own
behind
was
a
dresser
hung
with
spare
and
miscellaneous
crockery
with
a
workbox
and
an
untidy
there
was
an
ailing
musk
plant
in
the
window
and
the
tattered
and
blotched
wallpaper
was
covered
by
grocers
almanacs
feminine
wrappings
hung
from
pegs
upon
the
door
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
varied
collection
of
fragments
of
oilcloth
the
windsor
chair
he
sat
in
was
unstable
which
presently
afforded
material
for
humour
steady
old
nag
he
said
whoa
my
friskiacious
palfry
the
things
he
says
you
never
know
what
he
wo
say
next
iii
you
ai
talkin
of
goin
cried
larkins
supper
at
eight
stay
to
supper
with
now
you
come
over
said
larkins
with
corroborating
cries
from
minnie
a
bit
of
a
walk
with
the
gals
and
then
come
back
to
supper
you
might
all
go
and
meet
annie
while
i
straighten
up
and
lay
things
out
you
not
to
go
touching
the
front
room
mind
said
miriam
going
to
touch
yer
front
room
said
larkins
apparently
forgetful
for
a
moment
of
polly
both
girls
dressed
with
some
care
while
larkins
sketched
the
better
side
of
their
characters
and
then
the
three
young
people
went
out
to
see
something
of
stamton
in
the
streets
their
risible
mood
gave
way
to
a
propriety
that
was
particularly
evident
in
miriam
bearing
they
took
polly
to
the
stamton
wreckeryation
ground
that
at
least
was
what
they
called
it
with
its
handsome
custodian
cottage
its
asphalt
paths
its
jubilee
drinking
fountain
its
clumps
of
wallflower
and
daffodils
and
so
to
the
new
cemetery
and
a
distant
view
of
the
surrey
hills
and
round
by
the
gasworks
to
the
canal
to
the
factory
that
presently
disgorged
a
surprised
and
radiant
annie
said
annie
it
is
very
pleasant
to
every
properly
constituted
mind
to
be
a
centre
of
amiable
interest
for
one
fellow
creatures
and
when
one
is
a
young
man
conscious
of
becoming
mourning
and
a
certain
wit
and
the
fellow
creatures
are
three
young
and
ardent
and
sufficiently
expressive
young
women
who
dispute
for
the
honour
of
walking
by
side
one
may
be
excused
a
secret
exaltation
they
did
dispute
i
going
to
now
said
annie
you
two
been
all
the
afternoon
besides
i
got
something
to
say
to
him
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
it
came
presently
i
say
she
said
abruptly
i
get
them
rings
out
of
a
prize
packet
what
rings
asked
polly
what
you
saw
at
your
poor
father
funeral
you
made
out
they
meant
something
they
did
straight
then
some
people
have
been
very
remiss
about
their
chances
said
polly
understanding
they
have
had
any
chances
said
annie
i
do
believe
in
making
oneself
too
free
with
people
nor
me
said
polly
i
may
be
a
bit
larky
and
cheerful
in
my
manner
annie
admitted
but
it
do
anything
i
ai
that
sort
right
o
said
polly
iv
it
was
past
ten
when
polly
found
himself
riding
back
towards
easewood
in
a
broad
moonlight
with
a
little
japanese
lantern
dangling
from
his
handle
bar
and
making
a
fiery
circle
of
pinkish
light
on
and
round
about
his
front
wheel
he
was
mightily
pleased
with
himself
and
the
day
there
had
been
to
drink
at
supper
mixed
with
gingerbeer
very
free
and
jolly
in
a
jug
no
shadow
fell
upon
the
agreeable
excitement
of
his
mind
until
he
faced
the
anxious
and
reproachful
face
of
johnson
who
had
been
sitting
up
for
him
smoking
and
trying
to
read
the
odd
volume
of
purchas
his
pilgrimes
about
the
monk
who
went
into
sarmatia
and
saw
the
tartar
carts
not
had
an
accident
elfrid
said
johnson
the
weakness
of
polly
character
came
out
in
his
reply
not
much
he
said
pedal
got
a
bit
loose
in
stamton
o
man
ride
it
so
i
looked
up
the
cousins
while
i
waited
not
the
larkins
lot
yes
johnson
yawned
hugely
and
asked
for
and
was
given
friendly
particulars
well
he
said
better
get
to
bed
i
have
been
reading
that
book
of
yours
rum
stuff
ca
make
it
out
quite
quite
out
of
date
i
should
say
if
you
asked
me
that
all
right
o
man
said
polly
not
a
bit
of
use
for
anything
i
can
see
not
a
bit
see
any
shops
in
stamton
nothing
to
speak
of
said
polly
o
man
before
and
after
this
brief
conversation
his
mind
ran
on
his
cousins
very
warmly
and
prettily
in
the
vein
of
high
spring
polly
had
been
drinking
at
the
poisoned
fountains
of
english
literature
fountains
so
unsuited
to
the
needs
of
a
decent
clerk
or
shopman
fountains
charged
with
the
dangerous
suggestion
that
it
becomes
a
man
of
gaiety
and
spirit
to
make
love
gallantly
and
rather
carelessly
it
seemed
to
him
that
evening
to
be
handsome
and
humorous
and
practicable
to
make
love
to
all
his
cousins
it
was
that
he
liked
any
of
them
particularly
but
he
liked
something
about
them
he
liked
their
youth
and
femininity
their
resolute
high
spirits
and
their
interest
in
him
they
laughed
at
nothing
and
knew
nothing
and
minnie
had
lost
a
tooth
and
annie
screamed
and
shouted
but
they
were
interesting
intensely
interesting
and
miriam
was
so
bad
as
the
others
he
had
kissed
them
all
and
had
been
kissed
in
addition
several
times
by
minnie
oscoolatory
exercise
he
buried
his
nose
in
his
pillow
and
went
to
sleep
to
dream
of
anything
rather
than
getting
on
in
the
world
as
a
sensible
young
man
in
his
position
ought
to
have
done
v
and
now
polly
began
to
lead
a
divided
life
with
the
johnsons
he
professed
to
be
inclined
but
not
so
conclusively
inclined
as
to
be
inconvenient
to
get
a
shop
for
himself
to
be
to
use
the
phrase
he
preferred
looking
for
an
opening
he
would
ride
off
in
the
afternoon
upon
that
research
remarking
that
he
was
going
to
cast
a
strategetical
eye
on
chertsey
or
weybridge
but
if
not
all
roads
still
a
great
majority
of
them
led
by
however
devious
ways
to
stamton
and
to
laughter
and
increasing
familiarity
relations
developed
with
annie
and
minnie
and
miriam
their
various
characters
were
increasingly
interesting
the
laughter
became
perceptibly
less
abundant
something
of
the
fizz
had
gone
from
the
first
opening
still
these
visits
remained
wonderfully
friendly
and
upholding
then
back
he
would
come
to
grave
but
evasive
discussions
with
johnson
johnson
was
really
anxious
to
get
polly
into
something
his
was
a
reserved
honest
character
and
he
would
really
have
preferred
to
see
his
lodger
doing
things
for
himself
than
receive
his
money
for
housekeeping
he
hated
waste
anybody
waste
much
more
than
he
desired
profit
but
johnson
was
all
for
polly
loitering
she
seemed
much
the
more
human
and
likeable
of
the
two
to
polly
he
tried
at
times
to
work
up
enthusiasm
for
the
various
avenues
to
his
discussion
with
johnson
opened
but
they
remained
disheartening
prospects
he
imagined
himself
wonderfully
smartened
up
acquiring
style
and
value
in
a
london
shop
but
the
picture
was
stiff
and
unconvincing
he
tried
to
rouse
himself
to
enthusiasm
by
the
idea
of
his
property
increasing
by
leaps
and
bounds
by
twenty
pounds
a
year
or
so
let
us
say
each
year
in
a
little
shop
the
corner
shop
johnson
favoured
there
was
a
certain
picturesque
interest
in
imagining
economies
but
his
heart
told
him
there
would
be
little
in
practising
them
and
then
it
happened
to
polly
that
real
romance
came
out
of
dreamland
into
life
and
intoxicated
and
gladdened
him
with
sweetly
beautiful
suggestions
and
left
him
she
came
and
left
him
as
that
dear
lady
leaves
so
many
of
us
alas
not
sparing
him
one
jot
or
one
tittle
of
the
hollowness
of
her
retreating
aspect
it
was
all
the
more
to
polly
taste
that
the
thing
should
happen
as
things
happen
in
books
in
a
resolute
attempt
not
to
get
to
stamton
that
day
he
had
turned
due
southward
from
easewood
towards
a
country
where
the
abundance
of
bracken
jungles
lady
smock
stitchwork
bluebells
and
grassy
stretches
by
the
wayside
under
shady
trees
does
much
to
compensate
the
lighter
type
of
mind
for
the
absence
of
promising
openings
he
turned
aside
from
the
road
wheeled
his
machine
along
a
faintly
marked
attractive
trail
through
bracken
until
he
came
to
a
heap
of
logs
against
a
high
old
stone
wall
with
a
damaged
coping
and
wallflower
plants
already
gone
to
seed
he
sat
down
balanced
the
straw
hat
on
a
convenient
lump
of
wood
lit
a
cigarette
and
abandoned
himself
to
agreeable
musings
and
the
friendly
observation
of
a
cheerful
little
brown
and
grey
bird
his
stillness
presently
encouraged
to
approach
him
this
is
all
right
said
polly
softly
to
the
little
brown
and
grey
bird
business
later
he
reflected
that
he
might
go
on
this
way
for
four
or
five
years
and
then
be
scarcely
worse
off
than
he
had
been
in
his
father
lifetime
vile
business
said
polly
then
romance
appeared
or
to
be
exact
romance
became
audible
romance
began
as
a
series
of
small
but
increasingly
vigorous
movements
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
then
as
a
voice
murmuring
then
as
a
falling
of
little
fragments
on
the
hither
side
and
as
ten
pink
finger
tips
scarcely
apprehended
before
romance
became
startling
and
emphatically
a
leg
remained
for
a
time
a
fine
slender
actively
struggling
limb
brown
stockinged
and
wearing
a
brown
shoe
and
then
a
handsome
girl
wearing
a
short
dress
of
blue
linen
was
sitting
astride
the
wall
panting
considerably
disarranged
by
her
climbing
and
as
yet
unaware
of
polly
his
fine
instincts
made
him
turn
his
head
away
and
assume
an
attitude
of
negligent
contemplation
with
his
ears
and
mind
alive
to
every
sound
behind
him
goodness
said
a
voice
with
a
sharp
note
of
surprise
polly
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
dear
me
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
he
said
with
deferential
gallantry
i
do
know
said
the
young
lady
and
regarded
him
calmly
with
clear
blue
eyes
i
did
know
there
was
anyone
here
she
added
sorry
said
polly
if
i
am
intrudaceous
i
did
know
you
did
want
me
to
be
here
she
reflected
for
a
moment
on
the
word
it
is
that
she
said
surveying
him
i
ought
to
get
over
the
wall
she
explained
it
out
of
bounds
at
least
in
term
time
but
this
being
holidays
her
manner
placed
the
matter
before
him
holidays
is
different
said
polly
i
do
want
to
actually
the
rules
she
said
leave
them
behind
you
said
polly
with
a
catch
of
the
breath
where
they
are
safe
and
marvelling
at
his
own
wit
and
daring
and
indeed
trembling
within
himself
he
held
out
a
hand
for
her
she
brought
another
brown
leg
from
the
unknown
and
arranged
her
skirt
with
a
dexterity
altogether
feminine
i
think
i
stay
on
the
wall
she
decided
so
long
as
some
of
me
in
bounds
she
continued
to
regard
him
with
eyes
that
presently
joined
dancing
in
an
irresistible
smile
of
satisfaction
polly
smiled
in
return
you
bicycle
she
said
polly
admitted
the
fact
and
she
said
she
did
too
all
my
people
are
in
india
she
explained
it
beastly
rot
i
mean
it
frightfully
dull
being
left
here
alone
all
people
said
polly
are
in
heaven
i
say
fact
said
polly
got
nobody
and
that
why
she
checked
her
artless
comment
on
his
mourning
i
say
she
said
in
a
sympathetic
voice
i
sorry
i
really
am
was
it
a
fire
or
a
ship
or
something
her
sympathy
was
very
delightful
he
shook
his
head
the
ordinary
table
of
mortality
he
said
first
one
and
then
another
behind
his
outward
melancholy
delight
was
dancing
wildly
are
lonely
asked
the
girl
polly
nodded
i
was
just
sitting
there
in
melancholy
rectrospectatiousness
he
said
indicating
the
logs
and
again
a
swift
thoughtfulness
swept
across
her
face
there
no
harm
in
our
talking
she
reflected
it
a
kindness
wo
you
get
down
she
reflected
and
surveyed
the
turf
below
and
the
scene
around
and
him
i
stay
on
the
wall
she
said
if
only
for
bounds
sake
she
certainly
looked
quite
adorable
on
the
wall
she
had
a
fine
neck
and
pointed
chin
that
was
particularly
admirable
from
below
and
pretty
eyes
and
fine
eyebrows
are
never
so
pretty
as
when
they
look
down
upon
one
but
no
calculation
of
that
sort
thank
heaven
was
going
on
beneath
her
ruddy
shock
of
hair
vi
let
talk
she
said
and
for
a
time
they
were
both
polly
literary
proclivities
had
taught
him
that
under
such
circumstances
a
strain
of
gallantry
was
demanded
and
something
in
his
blood
repeated
that
lesson
you
make
me
feel
like
one
of
those
old
knights
he
said
who
rode
about
the
country
looking
for
dragons
and
beautiful
maidens
and
chivalresque
adventures
oh
she
said
why
beautiful
maiden
he
said
she
flushed
under
her
freckles
with
the
quick
bright
flush
those
pretty
people
have
nonsense
she
said
you
are
i
not
the
first
to
tell
you
that
a
beautiful
maiden
imprisoned
in
an
enchanted
school
would
think
it
enchanted
and
here
am
i
clad
in
steel
well
not
exactly
but
my
fiery
war
horse
is
anyhow
ready
to
absquatulate
all
the
dragons
and
rescue
you
she
laughed
a
jolly
laugh
that
showed
delightfully
gleaming
teeth
i
wish
you
could
the
dragons
she
said
with
great
enjoyment
polly
felt
they
were
a
sun
distance
from
the
world
of
everyday
fly
with
me
he
dared
she
stared
for
a
moment
and
then
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
you
funny
she
said
why
i
have
known
you
five
minutes
one
does
in
this
medevial
world
my
mind
is
made
up
anyhow
he
was
proud
and
pleased
with
his
joke
and
quick
to
change
his
key
neatly
i
wish
one
could
he
said
i
wonder
if
people
ever
did
if
there
were
people
like
you
we
do
even
know
each
other
names
she
remarked
with
a
descent
to
matters
of
fact
yours
is
the
prettiest
name
in
the
world
how
do
you
know
it
must
be
anyhow
it
rather
pretty
you
know
it
christabel
what
did
i
tell
you
and
yours
poorer
than
i
deserve
it
alfred
ca
call
you
alfred
well
polly
it
a
girl
name
for
a
moment
he
was
out
of
tune
i
wish
it
was
he
said
and
could
have
bitten
out
his
tongue
at
the
larkins
sound
of
it
i
sha
forget
it
she
remarked
consolingly
i
say
she
said
in
the
pause
that
followed
why
are
you
riding
about
the
country
on
a
bicycle
i
doing
it
because
i
like
it
she
sought
to
estimate
his
social
status
on
her
limited
basis
of
experience
he
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
against
the
wall
looking
up
at
her
and
tingling
with
daring
thoughts
he
was
a
littleish
man
you
must
remember
but
neither
nor
unhandsome
in
those
days
sunburnt
by
his
holiday
and
now
warmly
flushed
he
had
an
inspiration
to
simple
speech
that
no
practised
trifler
with
love
could
have
bettered
there
love
at
first
sight
he
said
and
said
it
sincerely
she
stared
at
him
with
eyes
round
and
big
with
excitement
i
think
she
said
slowly
and
without
any
signs
of
fear
or
retreat
i
ought
to
get
back
over
the
wall
it
need
matter
to
you
he
said
i
just
a
nobody
but
i
know
you
are
the
best
and
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
spoken
to
his
breath
caught
against
something
no
harm
in
telling
you
that
he
said
i
should
have
to
go
back
if
i
thought
you
were
serious
she
said
after
a
pause
and
they
both
smiled
together
after
that
they
talked
in
a
fragmentary
way
for
some
time
the
blue
eyes
surveyed
polly
with
kindly
curiosity
from
under
a
broad
finely
modelled
brow
much
as
an
exceptionally
intelligent
cat
might
survey
a
new
sort
of
dog
she
meant
to
find
out
all
about
him
she
asked
questions
that
riddled
the
honest
knight
in
armour
below
and
probed
ever
nearer
to
the
hateful
secret
of
the
shop
and
his
normal
servitude
and
when
he
made
a
flourish
and
mispronounced
a
word
a
thoughtful
shade
passed
like
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
across
her
face
boom
came
the
sound
of
a
gong
lordy
cried
the
girl
and
flashed
a
pair
of
brown
legs
at
him
and
was
gone
then
her
pink
finger
tips
reappeared
and
the
top
of
her
red
hair
knight
she
cried
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
knight
there
lady
he
answered
come
again
at
your
command
but
yes
just
one
finger
what
do
you
mean
to
kiss
the
rustle
of
retreating
footsteps
and
silence
but
after
he
had
waited
next
day
for
twenty
minutes
she
reappeared
a
little
out
of
breath
with
the
effort
to
surmount
the
wall
and
head
first
this
time
and
it
seemed
to
him
she
was
lighter
and
more
daring
and
altogether
prettier
than
the
dreams
and
enchanted
memories
that
had
filled
the
interval
vii
from
first
to
last
their
acquaintance
lasted
ten
days
but
into
that
time
polly
packed
ten
years
of
dreams
he
do
seem
said
johnson
to
take
a
serious
interest
in
anything
that
shop
at
the
corner
bound
to
be
snapped
up
if
he
look
out
the
girl
and
polly
did
not
meet
on
every
one
of
those
ten
days
one
was
sunday
and
she
could
not
come
and
on
the
eighth
the
school
reassembled
and
she
made
vague
excuses
all
their
meetings
amounted
to
this
that
she
sat
on
the
wall
more
or
less
in
bounds
as
she
expressed
it
and
let
polly
fall
in
love
with
her
and
try
to
express
it
below
she
sat
in
a
state
of
irresponsible
exaltation
watching
him
and
at
intervals
prodding
a
vivisecting
point
of
encouragement
into
him
with
that
strange
passive
cruelty
which
is
natural
to
her
sex
and
age
and
polly
fell
in
love
as
though
the
world
had
given
way
beneath
him
and
he
had
dropped
through
into
another
into
a
world
of
luminous
clouds
and
of
desolate
hopeless
wildernesses
of
desiring
and
of
wild
valleys
of
unreasonable
ecstasies
a
world
whose
infinite
miseries
were
finer
and
in
some
inexplicable
way
sweeter
than
the
purest
gold
of
the
daily
life
whose
joys
they
were
indeed
but
the
merest
remote
glimpses
of
joy
were
brighter
than
a
dying
martyr
vision
of
heaven
her
smiling
face
looked
down
upon
him
out
of
heaven
her
careless
pose
was
the
living
body
of
life
it
was
senseless
it
was
utterly
foolish
but
all
that
was
best
and
richest
in
polly
nature
broke
like
a
wave
and
foamed
up
at
that
girl
feet
and
died
and
never
touched
her
and
she
sat
on
the
wall
and
marvelled
at
him
and
was
amused
and
once
suddenly
moved
and
wrung
by
his
pleading
she
bent
down
rather
shamefacedly
and
gave
him
a
freckled
little
paw
to
kiss
and
she
looked
into
his
eyes
and
suddenly
felt
a
perplexity
a
curious
swimming
of
the
mind
that
made
her
recoil
and
stiffen
and
wonder
afterwards
and
dream
and
then
with
some
dim
instinct
of
she
went
and
told
her
three
best
friends
great
students
of
character
all
of
this
remarkable
phenomenon
she
had
discovered
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
look
here
said
polly
i
wild
for
the
love
of
you
i
keep
up
this
gesticulations
game
any
more
i
not
a
knight
treat
me
as
a
human
man
you
may
sit
up
there
smiling
but
i
die
in
torments
to
have
you
mine
for
an
hour
i
nobody
and
nothing
but
look
here
will
you
wait
for
me
for
five
years
you
just
a
girl
yet
and
it
would
be
hard
shut
up
said
christabel
in
an
aside
he
did
not
hear
and
something
he
did
not
see
touched
her
hand
i
always
been
just
dilletentytating
about
till
now
but
i
could
work
i
just
woke
up
wait
till
i
got
a
chance
with
the
money
i
got
but
you
have
got
much
money
i
got
enough
to
take
a
chance
with
some
sort
of
a
chance
find
a
chance
i
do
that
anyhow
i
go
away
i
mean
what
i
say
i
stop
trifling
and
shirking
if
i
do
come
back
it
matter
if
i
do
her
expression
had
become
uneasy
suddenly
she
bent
down
towards
him
do
she
said
in
an
undertone
do
what
do
go
on
like
this
you
different
go
on
being
the
knight
who
wants
to
kiss
my
hand
as
his
what
did
you
call
it
the
ghost
of
a
smile
curved
her
face
gurdrum
but
then
through
a
pause
they
both
stared
at
each
other
listening
a
muffled
tumult
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
asserted
itself
shut
rosie
said
a
voice
i
tell
you
i
will
see
i
ca
half
hear
give
me
a
leg
up
you
idiot
he
see
you
you
spoiling
everything
the
bottom
dropped
out
of
polly
world
he
felt
as
people
must
feel
who
are
going
to
faint
you
got
someone
he
said
aghast
she
found
life
inexpressible
to
polly
she
addressed
some
unseen
hearers
you
filthy
little
beasts
she
cried
with
a
sharp
note
of
agony
in
her
voice
and
swung
herself
back
over
the
wall
and
vanished
there
was
a
squeal
of
pain
and
fear
and
a
swift
fierce
altercation
for
a
couple
of
seconds
he
stood
agape
then
a
wild
resolve
to
confirm
his
worst
sense
of
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
made
him
seize
a
log
put
it
against
the
stones
clutch
the
parapet
with
insecure
fingers
and
lug
himself
to
a
momentary
balance
on
the
wall
romance
and
his
goddess
had
vanished
a
girl
with
a
pigtail
was
wringing
the
wrist
of
a
schoolfellow
who
shrieked
with
pain
and
cried
mercy
mercy
ooo
christabel
you
idiot
cried
christabel
you
giggling
idiot
two
other
young
ladies
made
off
through
the
beech
trees
from
this
outburst
of
savagery
then
the
grip
of
polly
fingers
gave
and
he
hit
his
chin
against
the
stones
and
slipped
clumsily
to
the
ground
again
scraping
his
cheek
against
the
wall
and
hurting
his
shin
against
the
log
by
which
he
had
reached
the
top
just
for
a
moment
he
crouched
against
the
wall
he
swore
staggered
to
the
pile
of
logs
and
sat
down
he
remained
very
still
for
some
time
with
his
lips
pressed
together
fool
he
said
at
last
you
blithering
fool
and
began
to
rub
his
shin
as
though
he
had
just
discovered
its
bruises
afterwards
he
found
his
face
was
wet
with
blood
which
was
none
the
less
red
stuff
from
the
heart
because
it
came
from
slight
abrasions
chapter
the
sixth
miriam
i
it
is
an
illogical
consequence
of
one
human
being
that
we
should
fly
immediately
to
another
but
that
is
the
way
with
us
it
seemed
to
polly
that
only
a
human
touch
could
assuage
the
smart
of
his
humiliation
moreover
it
had
for
some
undefined
reason
to
be
a
feminine
touch
and
the
number
of
women
in
his
world
was
limited
he
thought
of
the
larkins
family
the
larkins
whom
he
had
not
been
near
now
for
ten
long
days
healing
people
they
seemed
to
him
now
healing
simple
people
they
had
good
hearts
and
he
had
neglected
them
for
a
mirage
if
he
rode
over
to
them
he
would
be
able
to
talk
nonsense
and
laugh
and
forget
the
whirl
of
memories
and
thoughts
that
was
spinning
round
and
round
so
unendurably
in
his
brain
law
said
larkins
come
in
you
quite
a
stranger
elfrid
been
seeing
to
business
said
the
unveracious
polly

to
do
a
bit
of
shopping
wo

me

i
so
keerless
a
wonderful
manager

the
carpet

a
loving
deliket

into
the
front
parlour
it
a
bit
untidy
but
you
got
to
take
us
as
you
find
us
wot
you
been
doing
to
your
face
bit
of
a
scrase
with
the
bicycle
said
polly
trying
to
pass
a
carriage
on
the
on
side
and
he
drew
up
and
ran
me
against
a
wall
larkins
scrutinised
it
you
ought
to
someone
look
after
your
scrases
she
said
that
all
red
and
rough
it
ought
to
be
bring
your
bicycle
into
the
passage
and
come
in
she
straightened
up
a
bit
that
is
to
say
she
increased
the
dislocation
of
a
number
of
scattered
articles
put
a
workbasket
on
the
top
of
several
books
swept
two
or
three
numbers
of
the
own
from
the
table
into
the
broken
armchair
and
proceeded
to
sketch
together
the
with
various
such
interpolations
as
law
if
i
ai
forgot
the
butter
all
the
while
she
talked
of
annie
good
spirits
and
cleverness
with
her
millinery
and
of
minnie
affection
and
miriam
relative
love
of
order
and
management
polly
stood
by
the
window
uneasily
and
thought
how
good
and
sincere
was
the
larkins
tone
it
was
well
to
be
back
again
you
a
long
time
finding
that
shop
of
yours
said
larkins
do
do
to
be
precipitous
said
polly
no
said
larkins
once
you
got
it
you
got
it
like
choosing
a
you
better
see
you
got
it
good
i
kept
larkins
two
years
i
did
until
i
felt
sure
of
him
a
man
was
as
you
can
see
by
the
looks
of
the
girls
but
is
as
does
like
a
bit
of
jam
to
your
tea
i
expect
i
they
keep
men
waiting
when
the
time
comes
i
tell
them
if
they
think
of
marrying
it
only
shows
they
do
know
when
they
well
off
here
miriam
miriam
entered
with
several
parcels
in
a
net
and
a
peevish
expression
mother
she
said
you
might
prevented
my
going
out
with
the
net
with
the
broken
handle
i
been
cutting
my
fingers
with
the
string
all
the
way
then
she
discovered
polly
and
her
face
brightened
ello
elfrid
she
said
where
you
been
all
this
time
looking
round
said
polly
found
a
shop
one
or
two
likely
ones
but
it
takes
time
you
got
the
wrong
cups
mother
she
went
into
the
kitchen
disposed
of
her
purchases
and
returned
with
the
right
cups
what
you
done
to
your
face
elfrid
she
asked
and
came
and
scrutinised
his
scratches
all
rough
it
is
he
repeated
his
story
of
the
accident
and
she
was
sympathetic
in
a
pleasant
homely
way
you
are
quiet
she
said
as
they
sat
down
to
tea
meditatious
said
polly
quite
by
accident
he
touched
her
hand
on
the
table
and
she
answered
his
touch
why
not
thought
polly
and
looking
up
caught
larkins
eye
and
flushed
guiltily
but
larkins
with
unusual
restraint
said
nothing
she
merely
made
a
grimace
enigmatical
but
in
its
essence
friendly
presently
minnie
came
in
with
some
vague
grievance
against
the
manager
of
the
place
about
his
method
of
estimating
piece
work
her
account
was
redundant
defective
and
highly
technical
but
redeemed
by
a
certain
earnestness
i
never
within
sixpence
of
what
i
reckon
to
be
she
said
it
a
bit
too
then
polly
feeling
that
he
was
being
conspicuously
dull
launched
into
a
description
of
the
shop
he
was
looking
for
and
the
shops
he
had
seen
his
mind
warmed
up
as
he
talked
found
your
tongue
again
said
larkins
he
had
he
began
to
embroider
the
subject
and
work
upon
it
for
the
first
time
it
assumed
picturesque
and
desirable
qualities
in
his
mind
it
stimulated
him
to
see
how
readily
and
willingly
they
accepted
his
sketches
bright
ideas
appeared
in
his
mind
from
nowhere
he
was
suddenly
enthusiastic
when

he
straightened
himself
up
and
then
they
all
laughed
smart
little
shop
he
said
counter
desk
all
complete
umbrella
stand
carpet
on
the
floor

asleep
on
the
counter
ties
and
hose
on
a
rail
over

counter

off
said
miriam
mean
to
get
it
exactly
right
said
polly
have
to
have
a
tomcat
said
polly
and
paused
for
an
expectant
moment
would
do
to
open
shop
one
morning
you
know
and
find
the
window
full
of
kittens
ca
sell
kittens
when
tea
was
over
he
was
left
alone
with
minnie
for
a
few
minutes
and
an
odd
intimation
of
an
incident
occurred
that
left
polly
rather
scared
and
shaken
a
silence
fell
between
them
an
uneasy
silence
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
looking
at
her
all
the
way
from
easewood
to
stamton
his
erratic
imagination
had
been
running
upon
neat
ways
of
proposing
marriage
i
do
know
why
it
should
have
done
but
it
had
it
was
a
kind
of
secret
exercise
that
had
not
had
any
definite
aim
at
the
time
but
which
now
recurred
to
him
with
extraordinary
force
he
could
think
of
anything
in
the
world
that
was
the
gambit
to
a
proposal
it
was
almost
irresistibly
fascinating
to
think
how
immensely
a
few
words
from
him
would
excite
and
revolutionise
minnie
she
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
a
workbasket
among
the
tea
things
mending
a
glove
in
order
to
avoid
her
share
of
clearing
away
i
like
cats
said
minnie
after
a
thoughtful
pause
i
always
saying
to
mother
wish
we
a
cat
but
we
could
a
cat
not
with
no
yard
never
had
a
cat
myself
said
polly
no
i
fond
of
them
said
minnie
i
like
the
look
of
them
said
polly
ca

myself
fond
i
expect
i
shall
get
one
some
day
when
about
you
get
your
shop
i
shall
have
my
shop
all
right
before
long
said
polly
trust
me
canary
bird
and
all
she
shook
her
head
i
shall
get
a
cat
first
she
said
you
never
mean
anything
you
say
might
get
together
said
polly
with
his
sense
of
a
neat
thing
outrunning
his
discretion
why
mean
said
minnie
suddenly
alert
shop
and
cat
thrown
in
said
polly
in
spite
of
himself
and
his
head
swam
and
he
broke
out
into
a
cold
sweat
as
he
said
it
he
found
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
an
eager
expression
mean
to
say
she
began
as
if
for
verification
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
the
window
little
dog
he
said
and
moved
doorward
hastily
eating
my
bicycle
tire
i
believe
he
explained
and
so
escaped
he
saw
his
bicycle
in
the
hall
and
cut
it
dead
he
heard
larkins
in
the
passage
behind
him
as
he
opened
the
front
door
he
turned
to
her
thought
my
bicycle
was
on
fire
he
said
outside
funny
fancy
all
right
reely
little
dog
outside
miriam
ready
what
for
to
go
and
meet
annie
larkins
stared
at
him
you
stopping
for
a
bit
of
supper
if
i
may
said
polly
you
a
rum
un
said
larkins
and
called
miriam
minnie
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room
looking
infinitely
perplexed
there
ai
a
little
dog
anywhere
elfrid
she
said
polly
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
i
had
a
most
curious
sensation
felt
exactly
as
though
something
was
up
somewhere
why
i
said
little
dog
all
right
now
he
bent
down
and
pinched
his
bicycle
tire
you
was
saying
something
about
a
cat
elfrid
said
minnie
give
you
one
he
answered
without
looking
up
the
very
day
my
shop
is
opened
he
straightened
himself
up
and
smiled
reassuringly
trust
me
he
said
ii
when
after
imperceptible
manoeuvres
by
larkins
he
found
himself
starting
circuitously
through
the
inevitable
recreation
ground
with
miriam
to
meet
annie
he
found
himself
quite
unable
to
avoid
the
topic
of
the
shop
that
had
now
taken
such
a
grip
upon
him
a
sense
of
danger
only
increased
the
attraction
minnie
persistent
disposition
to
accompany
them
had
been
crushed
by
a
novel
and
violent
and
urgently
expressed
desire
on
the
part
of
larkins
to
see
her
do
something
in
the
house
sometimes
you
really
think
you
open
a
shop
asked
miriam
i
hate
cribs
said
polly
adopting
a
moderate
tone
in
a
shop
there
this
drawback
and
that
but
one
is
one
own
master
that
was
all
talk
not
a
bit
of
it
after
all
he
went
on
a
little
shop
need
be
so
bad
it
a
said
miriam
it
a
home
pause
there
no
need
to
keep
accounts
and
that
sort
of
thing
if
there
no
assistant
i
daresay
i
could
run
a
shop
all
right
if
i
interfered
with
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
your
shop
said
miriam
i
expect
keep
everything
tremendously
neat
the
conversation
flagged
let
sit
down
on
one
of
those
seats
over
there
said
miriam
where
we
can
see
those
blue
flowers
they
did
as
she
suggested
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
where
a
triangular
bed
of
stock
and
delphinium
brightened
the
asphalted
traceries
of
the
recreation
ground
i
wonder
what
they
call
those
flowers
she
said
i
always
like
them
they
handsome
delphicums
and
larkspurs
said
polly
they
used
to
be
in
the
park
at
port
burdock
floriferous
corner
he
added
approvingly
he
put
an
arm
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
assumed
a
more
comfortable
attitude
he
glanced
at
miriam
who
was
sitting
in
a
lax
thoughtful
pose
with
her
eyes
on
the
flowers
she
was
wearing
her
old
dress
she
had
not
had
time
to
change
and
the
blue
tones
of
her
old
dress
brought
out
a
certain
warmth
in
her
skin
and
her
pose
exaggerated
whatever
was
feminine
in
her
rather
lean
and
insufficient
body
and
rounded
her
flat
chest
delusively
a
little
line
of
light
lay
along
her
profile
the
afternoon
was
full
of
transfiguring
sunshine
children
were
playing
noisily
in
the
adjacent
sandpit
some
judas
trees
were
brightly
abloom
in
the
villa
gardens
that
bordered
the
recreation
ground
and
all
the
place
was
bright
with
touches
of
young
summer
colour
it
all
merged
with
the
effect
of
miriam
in
polly
mind
her
thoughts
found
speech
one
did
ought
to
be
happy
in
a
shop
she
said
with
a
note
of
unusual
softness
in
her
voice
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
right
one
did
ought
to
be
happy
in
a
shop
folly
not
to
banish
dreams
that
made
one
ache
of
townless
woods
and
bracken
tangles
and
figures
sitting
in
dappled
sunshine
upon
grey
and
crumbling
walls
and
looking
queenly
down
on
one
with
clear
blue
eyes
cruel
and
foolish
dreams
they
were
that
ended
in
one
being
laughed
at
and
made
a
mock
of
there
was
no
mockery
here
a
shop
such
a
respectable
thing
to
be
said
miriam
thoughtfully
could
be
happy
in
a
shop
he
said
his
sense
of
effect
made
him
pause
if
i
had
the
right
company
he
added
she
became
very
still
polly
swerved
a
little
from
the
conversational
upon
which
he
had
embarked
i
not
such
a
blooming
geezer
he
said
as
not
to
be
able
to
sell
goods
a
bit
one
has
to
be
nosy
over
one
buying
of
course
but
i
shall
do
all
right
he
stopped
and
felt
falling
falling
through
the
aching
silence
that
followed
if
you
get
the
right
company
said
miriam
i
shall
get
that
all
right
you
do
mean
you
got
someone
he
found
himself
plunging
i
got
someone
in
my
eye
this
minute
he
said
elfrid
she
said
turning
on
him
you
do
mean
well
he
mean
i
do
he
said
not
reely
she
clenched
her
hands
to
keep
still
he
took
the
conclusive
step
well
you
and
me
miriam
in
a
little
shop
with
a
cat
and
a
canary
he
tried
too
late
to
get
back
to
a
hypothetical
note
just
suppose
it
you
mean
said
miriam
you
in
love
with
me
elfrid
what
possible
answer
can
a
man
give
to
such
a
question
but
yes
regardless
of
the
public
park
the
children
in
the
sandpit
and
everyone
she
bent
forward
and
seized
his
shoulder
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
something
lit
up
in
polly
at
the
touch
he
put
an
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
back
and
felt
an
irrevocable
act
was
sealed
he
had
a
curious
feeling
that
it
would
be
very
satisfying
to
marry
and
have
a
wife
only
somehow
he
wished
it
was
miriam
her
lips
were
very
pleasant
to
him
and
the
feel
of
her
in
his
arm
they
recoiled
a
little
from
each
other
and
sat
for
a
moment
flushed
and
awkwardly
silent
his
mind
was
altogether
incapable
of
controlling
its
confusion
i
did
dream
said
miriam
you
cared
sometimes
i
thought
it
was
annie
sometimes
minnie
always
liked
you
better
than
them
said
polly
i
loved
you
elfrid
said
miriam
since
ever
we
met
at
your
poor
father
funeral
leastways
i
have
done
if
i
had
thought
you
did
seem
to
mean
anything
you
said
i
believe
it
she
added
nor
i
said
polly
you
mean
to
marry
me
and
start
that
little
shop
soon
as
ever
i
find
it
said
polly
i
had
no
more
idea
when
i
came
out
with
you
nor
me
it
like
a
dream
they
said
no
more
for
a
little
while
i
got
to
pinch
myself
to
think
it
real
said
miriam
what
do
without
me
at
i
ca
imagine
when
i
tell
them
for
the
life
of
him
polly
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
fullest
of
tender
anticipations
or
regretful
panic
mother
no
good
at
managing
not
a
bit
annie
do
care
for
work
and
minnie
got
no
for
it
what
they
do
without
me
i
ca
imagine
they
have
to
do
without
you
said
polly
sticking
to
his
guns
a
clock
in
the
town
began
striking
lor
said
miriam
we
shall
miss
annie
sitting
and
she
rose
and
made
as
if
to
take
polly
arm
but
polly
felt
that
their
condition
must
be
nakedly
exposed
to
the
ridicule
of
the
world
by
such
a
linking
and
evaded
her
movement
annie
was
already
in
sight
before
a
flood
of
hesitation
and
terrors
assailed
polly
do
tell
anyone
yet
a
bit
he
said
only
mother
said
miriam
firmly
iii
figures
are
the
most
shocking
things
in
the
world
the
prettiest
little
squiggles
of
black
looked
at
in
the
right
light
and
yet
consider
the
blow
they
can
give
you
upon
the
heart
you
return
from
a
little
careless
holiday
abroad
and
turn
over
the
page
of
a
newspaper
and
against
the
name
of
that
distant
railway
in
mortgages
upon
which
you
have
embarked
the
bulk
of
your
capital
you
see
instead
of
the
familiar
persistent
varying
at
most
to
this
slightly
richer
arrangement
of
marks
it
is
like
the
opening
of
a
pit
just
under
your
feet
so
too
polly
happy
sense
of
limitless
resources
was
obliterated
suddenly
by
a
vision
of
this
tracery
instead
of
the
he
had
come
to
regard
as
the
fixed
symbol
of
his
affluence
it
gave
him
a
disagreeable
feeling
about
the
diaphragm
akin
in
a
remote
degree
to
the
sensation
he
had
when
the
perfidy
of
the
schoolgirl
became
plain
to
him
it
made
his
brow
moist
going
down
a
vortex
he
whispered
by
a
characteristic
feat
of
subtraction
he
decided
that
he
must
have
spent
pounds
funererial
baked
meats
he
said
recalling
possible
items
the
happy
dream
in
which
he
had
been
living
of
long
warm
days
of
open
roads
of
limitless
unchecked
hours
of
infinite
time
to
look
about
him
vanished
like
a
thing
enchanted
he
was
suddenly
back
in
the
hard
old
economic
world
that
exacts
work
that
limits
range
that
discourages
phrasing
and
dispels
laughter
he
saw
wood
street
and
its
fearful
suspenses
yawning
beneath
his
feet
and
also
he
had
promised
to
marry
miriam
and
on
the
whole
rather
wanted
to
he
was
distraught
at
supper
afterwards
when
johnson
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
slight
headache
he
opened
a
conversation
with
johnson
it
about
time
o
man
i
saw
about
doing
something
he
said
riding
about
and
looking
at
shops
all
very
debonnairious
o
man
but
it
time
i
took
one
for
keeps
what
did
i
tell
you
said
johnson
how
do
you
think
that
corner
shop
of
yours
will
figure
out
polly
asked
you
really
meaning
it
if
it
a
practable
proposition
o
man
assuming
it
practable
what
your
idea
of
the
figures
johnson
went
to
the
chiffonier
got
out
a
letter
and
tore
off
the
back
sheet
let
figure
it
out
he
said
with
solemn
satisfaction
see
the
lowest
you
could
do
it
on
he
squared
himself
to
the
task
and
polly
sat
beside
him
like
a
pupil
watching
the
evolution
of
the
grey
distasteful
figures
that
were
to
dispose
of
his
little
hoard
what
running
expenses
have
we
got
to
provide
for
said
johnson
wetting
his
pencil
let
have
them
first
rent
at
the
end
of
an
hour
of
hideous
speculations
johnson
decided
close
but
you
have
a
chance
m
said
polly
what
more
does
a
brave
man
want
one
thing
you
can
do
quite
easily
i
asked
about
it
what
that
o
man
said
polly
take
the
shop
without
the
house
above
it
i
suppose
i
might
put
my
head
in
to
mind
it
said
polly
and
get
a
job
with
my
body
not
exactly
that
but
i
thought
you
save
a
lot
if
you
stayed
on
here
being
all
alone
as
you
are
never
thought
of
that
o
man
said
polly
and
reflected
silently
upon
the
needlessness
of
miriam
we
were
talking
of
eighty
pounds
for
stock
said
johnson
of
course
is
five
pounds
less
is
it
not
much
else
we
can
cut
no
said
polly
it
very
interesting
all
this
said
johnson
folding
up
the
half
sheet
of
paper
and
unfolding
it
i
wish
sometimes
i
had
a
business
of
my
own
instead
of
a
fixed
salary
you
have
to
keep
books
of
course
one
wants
to
know
where
one
is
i
should
do
it
all
by
double
entry
said
johnson
a
little
troublesome
at
first
but
far
the
best
in
the
end
lem
me
see
that
paper
said
polly
and
took
it
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
takes
a
nauseating
medicine
and
scrutinised
his
neat
figures
with
listless
eyes
well
said
johnson
rising
and
stretching
bed
better
sleep
on
it
o
man
right
o
said
polly
without
moving
but
indeed
he
could
as
well
have
slept
upon
a
bed
of
thorns
he
had
a
dreadful
night
it
was
like
the
end
of
the
annual
holiday
only
infinitely
worse
it
was
like
a
newly
arrived
prisoner
backward
glance
at
the
trees
and
heather
through
the
prison
gates
he
had
to
go
back
to
harness
and
he
was
as
fitted
to
go
in
harness
as
the
ordinary
domestic
cat
all
night
fate
with
the
quiet
complacency
and
indeed
at
times
the
very
face
and
gestures
of
johnson
guided
him
towards
that
undesired
establishment
at
the
corner
near
the
station
oh
lord
he
cried
i
rather
go
back
to
cribs
i
keep
my
money
anyhow
fate
never
winced
run
away
to
sea
whispered
polly
but
he
knew
he
was
man
enough
cut
my
blooming
throat
some
braver
strain
urged
him
to
think
of
miriam
and
for
a
little
while
he
lay
still
well
o
man
said
johnson
when
polly
came
down
to
breakfast
and
johnson
looked
up
brightly
polly
had
never
felt
breakfast
so
unattractive
before
just
a
day
or
so
more
o
man
to
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
he
said
you
get
the
place
snapped
up
said
johnson
there
were
times
in
those
last
few
days
of
coyness
with
his
destiny
when
his
engagement
seemed
the
most
negligible
of
circumstances
and
times
and
these
happened
for
the
most
part
at
nights
after
johnson
had
indulged
everybody
in
a
welsh
rarebit
when
it
assumed
so
sinister
and
portentous
an
appearance
as
to
make
him
think
of
suicide
and
there
were
times
too
when
he
very
distinctly
desired
to
be
married
now
that
the
idea
had
got
into
his
head
at
any
cost
also
he
tried
to
recall
all
the
circumstances
of
his
proposal
time
after
time
and
never
quite
succeeded
in
recalling
what
had
brought
the
thing
off
he
went
over
to
stamton
with
a
becoming
frequency
and
kissed
all
his
cousins
and
miriam
especially
a
great
deal
and
found
it
very
stirring
and
refreshing
they
all
appeared
to
know
and
minnie
was
tearful
but
resigned
larkins
met
him
and
indeed
enveloped
him
with
unwonted
warmth
and
there
was
a
big
pot
of
household
jam
for
tea
and
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
sign
his
name
to
anything
about
the
shop
though
it
crawled
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
though
the
project
had
materialised
now
to
the
extent
of
a
draft
agreement
with
the
place
for
his
signature
indicated
in
pencil
one
morning
just
after
johnson
had
gone
to
the
station
polly
wheeled
his
bicycle
out
into
the
road
went
up
to
his
bedroom
packed
his
long
white
nightdress
a
comb
and
a
toothbrush
in
a
manner
that
was
as
offhand
as
he
could
make
it
informed
johnson
who
was
manifestly
curious
that
he
was
off
for
a
day
or
two
to
clear
his
head
and
fled
forthright
into
the
road
and
mounting
turned
his
wheel
towards
the
tropics
and
the
equator
and
the
south
coast
of
england
and
indeed
more
particularly
to
where
the
little
village
of
fishbourne
slumbers
and
sleeps
when
he
returned
four
days
later
he
astonished
johnson
beyond
measure
by
remarking
so
soon
as
the
shop
project
was
reopened
i
took
a
little
contraption
at
fishbourne
o
man
that
i
fancy
suits
me
better
he
paused
and
then
added
in
a
manner
if
possible
even
more
offhand
oh
and
i
going
to
have
a
bit
of
a
nuptial
over
at
stamton
with
one
of
the
larkins
cousins
nuptial
said
johnson
wedding
bells
o
man
benedictine
collapse
on
the
whole
johnson
showed
great
it
your
own
affair
o
man
he
said
when
things
had
been
more
clearly
explained
and
i
hope
you
wo
feel
sorry
when
it
too
late
but
johnson
was
first
of
all
angrily
silent
and
then
reproachful
i
do
see
what
we
done
to
be
made
fools
of
like
this
she
said
after
all
the
trouble
we
to
make
you
comfortable
and
see
after
you
out
late
and
sitting
up
and
everything
and
then
you
go
off
as
sly
as
sly
without
a
word
and
get
a
shop
behind
our
backs
as
though
you
thought
we
meant
to
steal
your
money
i
patience
with
such
deceitfulness
and
i
did
think
it
of
you
elfrid
and
now
the
letting
season
gone
by
and
what
i
shall
do
with
that
room
of
yours
i
no
idea
frank
is
frank
and
fair
play
fair
play
so
was
told
when
i
was
a
girl
just
as
long
as
it
suits
you
to
stay
you
stay
and
then
it
off
and
no
thank
you
whether
we
like
it
or
not
johnson
too
easy
with
you
sits
there
and
does
say
a
word
and
night
after
night
been
addin
and
thinkin
for
you
instead
of
seeing
to
his
own
affairs
she
paused
for
breath
unfortunate
amoor
said
polly
apologetically
and
indistinctly
did
expect
it
myself
iv
polly
marriage
followed
with
a
certain
inevitableness
he
tried
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
acting
upon
his
own
forceful
initiative
but
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
the
completest
realisation
of
his
powerlessness
to
resist
the
gigantic
social
forces
he
had
set
in
motion
he
had
got
to
marry
under
the
will
of
society
even
as
in
times
past
it
has
been
appointed
for
other
sunny
souls
under
the
will
of
society
that
they
should
be
led
out
by
serious
and
unavoidable
and
ceremoniously
drowned
or
burnt
or
hung
he
would
have
preferred
infinitely
a
more
observant
and
less
conspicuous
rôle
but
the
choice
was
no
longer
open
to
him
he
did
his
best
to
play
his
part
and
he
procured
some
particularly
neat
check
trousers
to
do
it
in
the
rest
of
his
costume
except
for
some
bright
yellow
gloves
a
grey
and
blue
mixture
tie
and
that
the
broad
crape
was
changed
for
a
livelier
piece
of
silk
were
the
things
he
had
worn
at
the
funeral
of
his
father
so
nearly
akin
are
human
joy
and
sorrow
the
larkins
sisters
had
done
wonders
with
grey
sateen
the
idea
of
orange
blossom
and
white
veils
had
been
abandoned
reluctantly
on
account
of
the
expense
of
cabs
a
novelette
in
which
the
heroine
had
stood
at
the
altar
in
a
modest
dress
had
materially
assisted
this
decision
miriam
was
frankly
tearful
and
so
indeed
was
annie
but
with
laughter
as
well
to
carry
it
off
polly
heard
annie
say
something
vague
about
never
getting
a
chance
because
of
miriam
always
sticking
about
at
home
like
a
cat
at
a
that
became
as
people
say
food
for
thought
larkins
was
from
the
first
flushed
garrulous
and
wet
and
smeared
by
copious
weeping
an
incredibly
soaked
and
crumpled
and
pocket
handkerchief
never
left
the
clutch
of
her
plump
red
hand
goo
girls
all
of
them
she
kept
on
saying
in
a
tremulous
voice
she
wetted
polly
dreadfully
when
she
kissed
him
her
emotion
affected
the
buttons
down
the
back
of
her
bodice
and
almost
the
last
filial
duty
miriam
did
before
entering
on
her
new
life
was
to
close
that
gaping
orifice
for
the
eleventh
time
her
bonnet
was
small
and
black
adorned
with
red
roses
and
first
it
got
over
her
right
eye
until
annie
told
her
of
it
and
then
she
pushed
it
over
her
left
eye
and
looked
ferocious
for
a
space
and
after
that
baptismal
kissing
of
polly
the
delicate
millinery
took
fright
and
climbed
right
up
to
the
back
part
of
her
head
and
hung
on
there
by
a
pin
and
flapped
piteously
at
all
the
larger
waves
of
emotion
that
filled
the
gathering
polly
became
more
and
more
aware
of
that
bonnet
as
time
went
on
until
he
felt
for
it
like
a
thing
alive
towards
the
end
it
had
yawning
fits
the
company
did
not
include
johnson
but
johnson
came
with
a
manifest
surreptitiousness
and
backed
against
walls
and
watched
polly
with
doubt
and
speculation
in
his
large
grey
eyes
and
whistled
noiselessly
and
doubtful
on
the
edge
of
things
he
was
so
to
speak
to
be
best
man
a
sprinkling
of
girls
in
gay
hats
from
miriam
place
of
business
appeared
in
church
great
nudgers
all
of
them
but
only
two
came
on
afterwards
to
the
house
punt
brought
her
son
with
his
mind
it
was
his
first
wedding
and
a
larkins
uncle
a
voules
a
licenced
victualler
very
kindly
drove
over
in
a
gig
from
sommershill
with
a
plump
wife
to
give
the
bride
away
one
or
two
total
strangers
drifted
into
the
church
and
sat
down
observantly
far
away
this
sprinkling
of
people
seemed
only
to
enhance
the
cool
brown
emptiness
of
the
church
the
rows
and
rows
of
empty
pews
disengaged
prayerbooks
and
abandoned
hassocks
it
had
the
effect
of
a
preposterous
misfit
johnson
consulted
with
a
verger
about
the
disposition
of
the
party
the
officiating
clergy
appeared
distantly
in
the
doorway
of
the
vestry
putting
on
his
surplice
and
relapsed
into
a
contemplative
that
was
manifestly
habitual
before
the
bride
arrived
polly
sense
of
the
church
found
an
outlet
in
whispered
criticisms
of
ecclesiastical
architecture
with
johnson
early
norman
arches
eh
he
said
or
perpendicular
ca
say
said
johnson
telessated
pavements
all
right
it
well
laid
anyhow
ca
say
i
admire
the
altar
scrappy
rather
with
those
flowers
he
coughed
behind
his
hand
and
cleared
his
throat
at
the
back
of
his
mind
he
was
speculating
whether
flight
at
this
eleventh
hour
would
be
criminal
or
merely
reprehensible
bad
taste
a
murmur
from
the
nudgers
announced
the
arrival
of
the
bridal
party
the
little
procession
from
a
remote
door
became
one
of
the
enduring
memories
of
polly
life
the
little
verger
had
bustled
to
meet
it
and
arrange
it
according
to
tradition
and
morality
in
spite
of
larkins
do
take
her
from
me
yet
he
made
miriam
go
first
with
voules
the
bridesmaids
followed
and
then
himself
hopelessly
unable
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
whispering
maternal
anguish
of
larkins
voules
a
compact
rounded
woman
with
a
square
expressionless
face
imperturbable
dignity
and
a
dress
of
considerable
fashion
completed
the
procession
polly
eye
fell
first
upon
the
bride
the
sight
of
her
filled
him
with
a
curious
stir
of
emotion
alarm
desire
affection
respect
and
a
queer
element
of
reluctant
dislike
all
played
their
part
in
that
complex
eddy
the
grey
dress
made
her
a
stranger
to
him
made
her
stiff
and
commonplace
she
was
not
even
the
rather
drooping
form
that
had
caught
his
facile
sense
of
beauty
when
he
had
proposed
to
her
in
the
recreation
ground
there
was
something
too
that
did
not
please
him
in
the
angle
of
her
hat
it
was
indeed
an
hat
with
large
aimless
rosettes
of
pink
and
grey
then
his
mind
passed
to
larkins
and
the
bonnet
that
was
to
gain
such
a
hold
upon
him
it
seemed
to
be
as
she
advanced
and
to
the
two
eager
unrefined
sisters
he
was
acquiring
a
freak
of
fancy
set
him
wondering
where
and
when
in
the
future
a
beautiful
girl
with
red
hair
might
march
along
some
splendid
aisle
never
mind
he
became
aware
of
voules
he
became
aware
of
voules
as
a
watchful
blue
eye
of
intense
forcefulness
it
was
the
eye
of
a
man
who
has
got
hold
of
a
situation
he
was
a
fat
short
man
clad
in
a
tail
coat
of
black
and
white
check
with
a
coquettish
bow
tie
under
the
lowest
of
a
number
of
crisp
little
red
chins
he
held
the
bride
under
his
arm
with
an
air
of
invincible
championship
and
his
free
arm
flourished
a
grey
top
hat
of
an
equestrian
type
polly
instantly
learnt
from
the
eye
that
voules
knew
all
about
his
longing
for
flight
its
azure
pupil
glowed
with
disciplined
resolution
it
said
i
come
to
give
this
girl
away
and
give
her
away
i
will
i
here
now
and
things
have
to
go
on
all
right
so
do
think
of
it
any
more
and
polly
did
a
faint
phantom
of
a
certain
lill
dog
that
had
hovered
just
beneath
the
threshold
of
consciousness
vanished
into
black
impossibility
until
the
conclusive
moment
of
the
service
was
attained
the
eye
of
voules
watched
polly
relentlessly
and
then
instantly
he
relieved
guard
and
blew
his
nose
into
a
voluminous
and
richly
patterned
handkerchief
and
sighed
and
looked
round
for
the
approval
and
sympathy
of
voules
and
nodded
to
her
brightly
like
one
who
has
always
foretold
a
successful
issue
to
things
polly
felt
then
like
a
marionette
that
has
just
dropped
off
its
wire
but
it
was
long
before
that
release
arrived
he
became
aware
of
miriam
breathing
close
to
him
hullo
he
said
and
feeling
that
was
clumsy
and
would
meet
the
disapproval
grey
dress
suits
you
no
end
miriam
eyes
shone
under
her
not
reely
she
whispered
you
all
right
he
said
with
the
feeling
of
observation
and
criticism
stiffening
his
lips
he
cleared
his
throat
the
verger
hand
pushed
at
him
from
behind
someone
was
driving
miriam
towards
the
altar
rail
and
the
clergyman
we
in
for
it
said
polly
to
her
sympathetically
where
here
right
o
he
was
interested
for
a
moment
or
so
in
something
indescribably
habitual
in
the
clergyman
pose
what
a
lot
of
weddings
he
must
have
seen
sick
he
must
be
of
them
do
let
your
attention
wander
said
the
eye
got
the
ring
whispered
johnson
pawned
it
yesterday
answered
polly
and
then
had
a
dreadful
moment
under
that
pitiless
scrutiny
while
he
felt
in
the
wrong
waistcoat
pocket
the
officiating
clergy
sighed
deeply
began
and
married
them
wearily
and
without
any
hitch
we
gath
sight
o
gard
face
this
join
man
worn
holy
which
is
state
stooted
by

in
times
man
polly
thoughts
wandered
wide
and
far
and
once
again
something
like
a
cold
hand
touched
his
heart
and
he
saw
a
sweet
face
in
sunshine
under
the
shadow
of
trees
someone
was
nudging
him
it
was
johnson
finger
diverted
his
eyes
to
the
crucial
place
in
the
to
which
they
had
come
wiltou

polly
moistened
his
lips
i

he
said
hoarsely
miriam
nearly
inaudible
answered
some
similar
demand
then
the
clergyman
said
who
gifs
worn
married
to
this
man
well
doing
that
said
voules
in
a
refreshingly
full
voice
and
looking
round
the
church
you
see
me
and
martha
larkins
being
cousins
he
was
silenced
by
the
clergyman
rapid
grip
directing
the
exchange
of
hands
pete

said
the
clergyman
to
polly

the

so
here
pete

ivy

so
it
went
on
blurred
and
hurried
like
the
momentary
vision
of
an
utterly
beautiful
thing
seen
through
the
smoke
of
a
passing
train
now
my
boy
said
voules
at
last
gripping
polly
elbow
tightly
you
got
to
sign
the
registry
and
there
you
are
done
before
him
stood
miriam
a
little
stiffly
the
hat
with
a
slight
rake
across
her
forehead
and
a
kind
of
questioning
hesitation
in
her
face
voules
urged
him
past
her
it
was
astounding
she
was
his
wife
and
for
some
reason
miriam
and
larkins
were
sobbing
and
annie
was
looking
grave
had
they
after
all
wanted
him
to
marry
her
because
if
that
was
the
case
he
became
aware
for
the
first
time
of
the
presence
of
uncle
pentstemon
in
the
background
but
approaching
wearing
a
tie
of
a
light
mineral
blue
colour
and
grinning
and
sucking
enigmatically
and
judiciously
round
his
principal
tooth
v
it
was
in
the
vestry
that
the
force
of
voules
personality
began
to
show
at
its
true
value
he
seemed
to
open
out
and
spread
over
things
directly
the
restraints
of
the
ceremony
were
at
an
end
everything
he
said
to
the
clergyman
excellent
he
also
shook
hands
with
larkins
who
clung
to
him
for
a
space
and
kissed
miriam
on
the
cheek
first
kiss
for
me
he
said
anyhow
he
led
polly
to
the
register
by
the
arm
and
then
got
chairs
for
larkins
and
his
wife
he
then
turned
on
miriam
now
young
people
he
said
one
or
shall
again
that
right
said
voules
same
again
miss
polly
was
overcome
with
modest
confusion
and
turning
found
a
refuge
from
this
publicity
in
the
arms
of
larkins
then
in
a
state
of
profuse
moisture
he
was
assaulted
and
kissed
by
annie
and
minnie
who
were
immediately
kissed
upon
some
indistinctly
stated
grounds
by
voules
who
then
kissed
the
entirely
impassive
voules
and
smacked
his
lips
and
remarked
home
again
safe
and
sound
then
with
a
strange
harrowing
cry
larkins
seized
upon
and
bedewed
miriam
with
kisses
annie
and
minnie
kissed
each
other
and
johnson
went
abruptly
to
the
door
of
the
vestry
and
stared
into
the
church
no
doubt
with
ideas
of
sanctuary
in
his
mind
like
a
bit
of
a
kiss
round
sometimes
said
voules
and
made
a
kind
of
hissing
noise
with
his
teeth
and
suddenly
smacked
his
hands
together
with
great
several
times
meanwhile
the
clergyman
scratched
his
cheek
with
one
hand
and
fiddled
the
pen
with
the
other
and
the
verger

found
himself
and
the
bride
leading
the
way
towards
the
western
door
larkins
passed
close
to
uncle
pentstemon
sobbing
too
earnestly
to
be
aware
of
him
such
a
she
sobbed
did
think
come
did
you
said
uncle
pentstemon
but
she
swept
past
him
too
busy
with
the
expression
of
her
feelings
to
observe
him
she
did
think
i
come
i
lay
said
uncle
pentstemon
a
little
foiled
but
effecting
an
auditory
lodgment
upon
johnson
i
do
know
said
johnson
uncomfortably
i
suppose
you
were
asked
how

getting
on
i
was
said
uncle
pentstemon
and
brooded
for
a
moment
i
goes
about
seeing
wonders
he
added
and
then
in
a
sort
of
enhanced
undertone
one
of
girls
gettin
married
that
what
i
mean
by
wonders
lord
goodness
wow
nothing
the
matter
asked
johnson
got
it
in
the
back
for
a
moment
going
to
be
a
change
of
weather
i
suppose
said
uncle
pentstemon
i
brought
a
nice
present
too
what
i
got
in
this
passel
vallyble
old
tea
caddy
that
uset

my
mother
what
i

years
and
years
till

hinge

it

been
no
use
to
me
particular
since
so
thinks
i
drat
it
i
may
as
well
give
it
as
not
polly
found
himself
emerging
from
the
western
door
outside
a
crowd
of
adults
and
about
fifty
children
had
collected
and
hailed
the
approach
of
the
newly
wedded
couple
with
a
faint
indeterminate
cheer
all
the
children
were
holding
something
in
little
bags
and
his
attention
was
caught
by
the
expression
of
vindictive
concentration
upon
the
face
of
a
small
boy
in
the
foreground
he
did
for
the
moment
realise
what
these
things
might
import
then
he
received
a
stinging
handful
of
rice
in
the
ear
and
a
great
light
shone
not
yet
you
young
fool
he
heard
voules
saying
behind
him
and
then
a
second
handful
spoke
against
his
hat
not
yet
said
voules
with
increasing
emphasis
and
polly
became
aware
that
he
and
miriam
were
the
focus
of
two
crescents
of
small
boys
each
with
the
light
of
massacre
in
his
eyes
and
a
grubby
fist
clutching
into
a
paper
bag
for
rice
and
that
voules
was
warding
off
probable
discharges
with
a
large
red
hand
the
dog
cart
was
in
charge
of
a
loafer
and
the
horse
and
the
whip
were
adorned
with
white
favours
and
the
back
seat
was
confused
but
not
untenable
with
hampers
up
we
go
said
voules
old
birds
in
front
and
young
ones
behind
an
ominous
group
of
followed
them
up
as
they
mounted
get
your
handkerchief
for
your
face
said
polly
to
his
bride
and
took
the
place
next
the
pavement
with
considerable
heroism
held
on
gripped
his
hat
shut
his
eyes
and
prepared
for
the
worst
off
said
voules
and
a
concentrated
fire
came
stinging
face
the
horse
shied
and
when
the
bridegroom
could
look
at
the
world
again
it
was
manifest
the
dog
cart
had
just
missed
an
electric
tram
by
a
hairsbreadth
and
far
away
outside
the
church
railings
the
verger
and
johnson
were
battling
with
an
active
crowd
of
small
boys
for
the
life
of
the
rest
of
the
larkins
family
punt
and
her
son
had
escaped
across
the
road
the
son
trailing
and
stumbling
at
the
end
of
a
remorseless
arm
but
uncle
pentstemon
encumbered
by
the
was
the
centre
of
a
little
circle
of
his
own
and
appeared
to
be
dratting
them
all
very
heartily
remoter
a
policeman
approached
with
an
air
of
tranquil
unconsciousness
steady
you
idiot
cried
voules
and
then
over
his
shoulder
i
brought
that
rice
i
like
old
customs
whoa
the
dog
cart
swerved
violently
and
then
evoking
a
shout
of
groundless
alarm
from
a
cyclist
took
a
corner
and
the
rest
of
the
wedding
party
was
hidden
from
polly
eyes
vi
we
get
the
stuff
into
the
house
before
the
old
gal
comes
along
said
voules
if
you
hold
the
hoss
how
about
the
key
asked
polly
i
got
the
key
coming
and
while
polly
held
the
sweating
horse
and
dodged
the
foam
that
dripped
from
its
bit
the
house
absorbed
miriam
and
voules
altogether
voules
carried
in
the
various
hampers
he
had
brought
with
him
and
finally
closed
the
door
behind
him
for
some
time
polly
remained
alone
with
his
charge
in
the
little
blind
alley
outside
the
larkins
house
while
the
neighbours
scrutinised
him
from
behind
their
blinds
he
reflected
that
he
was
a
married
man
that
he
must
look
very
like
a
fool
that
the
head
of
a
horse
is
a
silly
shape
and
its
eye
a
bulger
he
wondered
what
the
horse
thought
of
him
and
whether
it
really
liked
being
held
and
patted
on
the
neck
or
whether
it
only
submitted
out
of
contempt
did
it
know
he
was
married
then
he
wondered
if
the
clergyman
had
thought
him
much
of
an
ass
and
then
whether
the
individual
lurking
behind
the
lace
curtains
of
the
front
room
next
door
was
a
man
or
a
woman
a
door
opened
over
the
way
and
an
elderly
gentleman
in
a
kind
of
embroidered
fez
appeared
smoking
a
pipe
with
a
quiet
satisfied
expression
he
regarded
polly
for
some
time
with
mild
but
sustained
curiosity
finally
he
called
hi
hullo
said
polly
you
need
that
said
the
old
gentleman
spirited
beast
said
polly
and
with
some
faint
analogy
to
ginger
beer
in
his
mind
he
up
wo
turn
round
said
the
old
gentleman
anyow
and
there
ai
no
way
through
for
to
go
sap
said
polly
and
abandoned
the
horse
and
turned
to
the
door
it
opened
to
him
just
as
larkins
on
the
arm
of
johnson
followed
by
annie
minnie
two
friends
punt
and
her
son
and
at
a
slight
distance
uncle
pentstemon
appeared
round
the
corner
they
coming
he
said
to
miriam
and
put
an
arm
about
her
and
gave
her
a
kiss
she
was
kissing
him
back
when
they
were
startled
violently
by
the
shying
of
two
empty
hampers
into
the
passage
then
voules
appeared
holding
a
third
here
you
plenty
of
time
for
that
presently
he
said
get
these
hampers
away
before
the
old
girl
comes
i
got
a
cold
collation
here
to
make
her
sit
up
my
eye
miriam
took
the
hampers
and
polly
under
compulsion
from
voules
went
into
the
little
front
room
a
profuse
pie
and
a
large
ham
had
been
added
to
the
modest
provision
of
larkins
and
a
number
of
bottles
shouldered
the
bottle
of
sherry
and
the
bottle
of
port
she
had
got
to
grace
the
feast
they
certainly
went
better
with
the
iced
wedding
cake
in
the
middle
voules
still
impassive
stood
by
the
window
regarding
these
things
with
a
faint
approval
makes
it
look
a
bit
thicker
eh
said
voules
and
blew
out
both
his
cheeks
and
smacked
his
hands
together
violently
several
times
surprise
the
old
girl
no
end
he
stood
back
and
smiled
and
bowed
with
arms
extended
as
the
others
came
clustering
at
the
door
why
voules
cried
annie
with
a
rising
note
it
was
his
reward
and
then
came
a
great
wedging
and
squeezing
and
crowding
into
the
little
room
nearly
everyone
was
hungry
and
eyes
brightened
at
the
sight
of
the
pie
and
the
ham
and
the
convivial
array
of
bottles
sit
down
everyone
cried
voules
leaning
against
anything
counts
as
sitting
and
makes
it
easier
to
shake
down
the
grub
the
two
friends
from
miriam
place
of
business
came
into
the
room
among
the
first
and
then
wedged
themselves
so
hopelessly
against
johnson
in
an
attempt
to
get
out
again
and
take
off
their
things
upstairs
that
they
abandoned
the
attempt
amid
the
struggle
polly
saw
uncle
pentstemon
relieve
himself
of
his
parcel
by
giving
it
to
the
bride
here
he
said
and
handed
it
to
her
weddin
present
he
explained
and
added
with
a
confidential
chuckle

applause

they
did
and
the
plates
clattered
and
the
glasses
chinked

with
johnson
for
a
moment
in
for

cheeringly

polly

sit
down
to

johnson
subsided
gloomily
and
polly
secured
some
ham
and
carried
it
off
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
sewing
machine
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
to
devour
it
he
was
hungry
and
a
little
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
company
by
voules
hat
and
back
and
he
occupied
himself
for
a
time
with
ham
and
his
own
thoughts
he
became
aware
of
a
series
of
jangling
concussions
on
the
table
he
craned
his
neck
and
discovered
that
voules
was
standing
up
and
leaning
forward
over
the
table
in
the
manner
distinctive
of
speeches
tapping
upon
the
table
with
a
black
bottle
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
voules
raising
his
glass
solemnly
in
the
empty
desert
of
sound
he
had
made
and
paused
for
a
second
or
so
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
bride
he
searched
his
mind
for
some
suitable
wreath
of
speech
and
brightened
at
last
with
discovery
here
luck
to
her
he
said
at
last
here
luck
said
johnson
hopelessly
but
resolutely
and
raised
his
glass
everybody
murmured
here
luck
luck
said
polly
unseen
in
his
corner
lifting
a
forkful
of
ham
that
all
right
said
voules
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
having
brought
off
a
difficult
operation
and
now
who
for
a
bit
more
pie
for
a
time
conversation
was
fragmentary
again
but
presently
voules
rose
from
his
chair
again
he
had
subsided
with
a
contented
smile
after
his
first
oratorical
effort
and
produced
a
silence
by
renewed
hammering
ladies
and
gents
he
said
fill
up
for
the
second
toast
the
happy
bridegroom
he
stood
for
half
a
minute
searching
his
mind
for
the
apt
phrase
that
came
at
last
in
a
rush
here
hic
luck
to
said
voules
luck
to
him
said
everyone
and
polly
standing
up
behind
voules
bowed
amiably
amidst
enthusiasm
he
may
say
what
he
likes
said
larkins
he
luck
that
girl
a
treasure
of
treasures
and
always
has
been
ever
since
she
tried
to
nurse
her
own
little
sister
being
but
three
at
the
time
and
fell
the
full
flight
of
stairs
from
top
to
bottom
no
hurt
that
any
outward
eye
even
seen
but
always
ready
and
helpful
always
tidying
and
busy
a
treasure
i
must
say
and
a
treasure
i
will
say
giving
no
more
than
her
due
she
was
silenced
altogether
by
a
rapping
sound
that
would
not
be
denied
voules
had
been
struck
by
a
fresh
idea
and
was
standing
up
and
hammering
with
the
bottle
again
the
third
toast
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
fill
up
please
the
mother
of
the
bride
i
er
uoo
ere
ladies
and
gem
luck
to
vii
the
dingy
little
room
was
stuffy
and
crowded
to
its
utmost
limit
and
polly
skies
were
dark
with
the
sense
of
irreparable
acts
everybody
seemed
noisy
and
greedy
and
doing
foolish
things
miriam
still
in
that
unbecoming
hat
for
presently
they
had
to
start
off
to
the
station
together
sat
just
beyond
punt
and
her
son
doing
her
share
in
the
hospitalities
and
ever
and
again
glancing
at
him
with
a
deliberately
encouraging
smile
once
she
leant
over
the
back
of
the
chair
to
him
and
whispered
cheeringly
soon
be
together
now
next
to
her
sat
johnson
profoundly
silent
and
then
annie
talking
vigorously
to
a
friend
uncle
pentstemon
was
eating
voraciously
opposite
but
with
a
kindling
eye
for
annie
larkins
sat
next
to
voules
she
was
unable
to
eat
a
mouthful
she
declared
it
would
choke
her
but
ever
and
again
voules
wooed
her
to
swallow
a
little
drop
of
liquid
refreshment
there
seemed
a
lot
of
rice
upon
everybody
in
their
hats
and
hair
and
the
folds
of
their
garments
presently
voules
was
hammering
the
table
for
the
fourth
time
in
the
interests
of
the
best
man
all
feasts
come
to
an
end
at
last
and
the
breakup
of
things
was
precipitated
by
alarming
symptoms
on
the
part
of
master
punt
he
was
taken
out
hastily
after
a
whispered
consultation
and
since
he
had
got
into
the
corner
between
the
fireplace
and
the
cupboard
that
meant
everyone
moving
to
make
way
for
him
johnson
took
the
opportunity
to
say
well
so
long
to
anyone
who
might
be
listening
and
disappear
polly
found
himself
smoking
a
cigarette
and
walking
up
and
down
outside
in
the
company
of
uncle
pentstemon
while
voules
replaced
bottles
in
hampers
and
prepared
for
departure
and
the
womenkind
of
the
party
crowded
upstairs
with
the
bride
polly
felt
taciturn
but
the
events
of
the
day
had
stirred
the
mind
of
uncle
pentstemon
to
speech
and
so
he
spoke
discursively
and
disconnectedly
a
little
heedless
of
his
listener
as
wise
old
men
will
they
do
say
said
uncle
pentstemon
one

viii
at
last
it
was
time
for
the
two
young
people
to
catch
the
train
for
waterloo
for
fishbourne
they
had
to
hurry
and
as
a
concluding
glory
of
matrimony
they
travelled
and
were
seen
off
by
all
the
rest
of
the
party
except
the
punts
master
punt
being
now
beyond
any
question
unwell
off
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
polly
remained
waving
his
hat
and
polly
her
handkerchief
until
they
were
hidden
under
the
bridge
the
dominating
figure
to
the
last
was
voules
he
had
followed
them
along
the
platform
waving
the
equestrian
grey
hat
and
kissing
his
hand
to
the
bride
they
subsided
into
their
seats
got
a
compartment
to
ourselves
anyhow
said
polly
after
a
pause
silence
for
a
moment
the
rice
must
bought
pounds
and
pounds
polly
felt
round
his
collar
at
the
thought
ai
you
going
to
kiss
me
elfrid
now
we
alone
together
he
roused
himself
to
sit
forward
hands
on
knees
cocked
his
hat
over
one
eye
and
assumed
an
expression
of
avidity
becoming
to
the
occasion
never
he
said
ever
and
feigned
to
be
selecting
a
place
to
kiss
with
great
discrimination
come
here
he
said
and
drew
her
to
him
be
careful
of
my
said
polly
yielding
awkwardly
chapter
the
seventh
the
little
shop
at
fishbourne
i
for
fifteen
years
polly
was
a
respectable
shopkeeper
in
fishbourne
years
they
were
in
which
every
day
was
tedious
and
when
they
were
gone
it
was
as
if
they
had
gone
in
a
flash
but
now
polly
had
good
looks
no
more
he
was
as
i
have
described
him
in
the
beginning
of
this
story
and
fattish
in
a
not
very
healthy
way
dull
and
yellowish
about
the
complexion
and
with
discontented
wrinklings
round
his
eyes
he
sat
on
the
stile
above
fishbourne
and
cried
to
the
heavens
above
him
oh
silly
hole
and
he
wore
a
rather
shabby
black
morning
coat
and
vest
and
his
tie
was
richly
splendid
being
from
stock
and
his
golf
cap
aslant
over
one
eye
fifteen
years
ago
and
it
might
have
seemed
to
you
that
the
queer
little
flower
of
polly
imagination
must
be
altogether
withered
and
dead
and
with
no
living
seed
left
in
any
part
of
him
but
indeed
it
still
lived
as
an
insatiable
hunger
for
bright
and
delightful
experiences
for
the
gracious
aspects
of
things
for
beauty
he
still
read
books
when
he
had
a
chance
books
that
told
of
glorious
places
abroad
and
glorious
times
that
wrung
a
rich
humour
from
life
and
contained
the
delight
of
words
freshly
and
expressively
grouped
but
alas
there
are
not
many
such
books
and
for
the
newspapers
and
the
cheap
fiction
that
abounded
more
and
more
in
the
world
polly
had
little
taste
there
was
no
epithet
in
them
and
there
was
no
one
to
talk
to
as
he
loved
to
talk
and
he
had
to
mind
his
shop
it
was
a
reluctant
little
shop
from
the
beginning
he
had
taken
it
to
escape
the
doom
of
johnson
choice
and
because
fishbourne
had
a
hold
upon
his
imagination
he
had
disregarded
the
cramped
rooms
behind
it
in
which
he
would
have
to
lurk
and
live
the
relentless
limitations
of
its
dimensions
the
inconvenience
of
an
underground
kitchen
that
must
necessarily
be
the
in
winter
the
narrow
yard
behind
giving
upon
the
yard
of
the
royal
fishbourne
hotel
the
tiresome
sitting
and
waiting
for
custom
the
restricted
prospects
of
trade
he
had
visualised
himself
and
miriam
first
as
at
breakfast
on
a
clear
bright
winter
morning
amidst
a
tremendous
smell
of
bacon
and
then
as
having
muffins
for
tea
he
had
also
thought
of
sitting
on
the
beach
on
sunday
afternoons
and
of
going
for
a
walk
in
the
country
behind
the
town
and
picking
and
poppies
but
in
fact
miriam
and
he
were
extremely
cross
at
breakfast
and
it
did
run
to
muffins
at
tea
and
she
did
think
it
looked
well
she
said
to
go
trapesing
about
the
country
on
sundays
it
was
unfortunate
that
miriam
never
took
to
the
house
from
the
first
she
did
not
like
it
when
she
saw
it
and
liked
it
less
as
she
explored
it
there
too
many
stairs
she
said
and
the
coal
being
indoors
will
make
a
lot
of
work
did
think
of
that
said
polly
following
her
round
it
be
a
hard
house
to
keep
clean
said
miriam
white
paint
all
very
well
in
its
way
said
miriam
but
it
shows
the
dirt
something
fearful
better
it
nicely
grained
there
a
kind
of
place
here
said
polly
where
we
might
have
some
flowers
in
pots
not
me
said
miriam
i
trouble
enough
with
minnie
and
musk
they
stayed
for
a
week
in
a
cheap
boarding
house
before
they
moved
in
they
had
bought
some
furniture
in
stamton
mostly
but
with
new
cheap
cutlery
and
china
and
linen
and
they
had
supplemented
this
from
the
fishbourne
shops
miriam
relieved
from
the
hilarious
associations
of
home
developed
a
meagre
and
serious
quality
of
her
own
and
went
about
with
knitted
brows
pursuing
some
ideal
of
everything
right
polly
gave
himself
to
the
arrangement
of
the
shop
with
a
certain
zest
and
whistled
a
good
deal
until
miriam
appeared
and
said
that
it
went
through
her
head
so
soon
as
he
had
taken
the
shop
he
had
filled
the
window
with
aggressive
posters
announcing
in
no
measured
terms
that
he
was
going
to
open
and
now
he
was
getting
his
stuff
put
out
he
was
resolved
to
show
fishbourne
what
window
dressing
could
do
he
meant
to
give
them
boater
straws
imitation
panamas
bathing
dresses
with
novelties
in
stripes
light
flannel
shirts
summer
ties
and
flannel
trousers
for
men
youths
and
boys
incidentally
he
watched
the
small
fishmonger
over
the
way
and
had
a
glimpse
of
the
china
dealer
next
door
and
wondered
if
a
friendly
nod
would
be
out
of
place
and
on
the
first
sunday
in
this
new
life
he
and
miriam
arrayed
themselves
with
great
care
he
in
his
hat
and
coat
and
she
in
her
dress
and
went
processionally
to
church
a
more
respectable
looking
couple
you
could
hardly
imagine
and
looked
about
them
things
began
to
settle
down
next
week
into
their
places
a
few
customers
came
chiefly
for
bathing
suits
and
hat
guards
and
on
saturday
night
the
cheapest
straw
hats
and
ties
and
polly
found
himself
more
and
more
drawn
towards
the
shop
door
and
the
social
charm
of
the
street
he
found
the
china
dealer
unpacking
a
crate
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
fine
day
the
china
dealer
gave
a
reluctant
assent
and
plunged
into
the
crate
in
a
manner
that
presented
no
encouragement
to
a
loquacious
neighbour
zealacious
commerciality
whispered
polly
to
that
unfriendly
back
view
ii
miriam
combined
earnestness
of
spirit
with
great
practical
incapacity
the
house
was
never
clean
nor
tidy
but
always
being
frightfully
disarranged
for
cleaning
or
tidying
up
and
she
cooked
because
food
had
to
be
cooked
and
with
a
sound
moralist
entire
disregard
of
the
quality
of
the
consequences
the
food
came
from
her
hands
done
rather
than
improved
and
looking
as
uncomfortable
as
savages
clothed
under
duress
by
a
missionary
with
a
stock
of
such
food
is
too
apt
to
behave
resentfully
rebel
and
work
obi
she
ceased
to
listen
to
her
husband
talk
from
the
day
she
married
him
and
ceased
to
unwrinkle
the
kink
in
her
brow
at
his
presence
giving
herself
up
to
mental
states
that
had
a
quality
of
secret
preoccupation
and
she
developed
an
idea
for
which
perhaps
there
was
legitimate
excuse
that
he
was
lazy
he
seemed
to
stand
about
in
the
shop
a
great
deal
to
read
an
indolent
habit
and
presently
to
seek
company
for
talking
he
began
to
attend
the
bar
parlour
of
the
god
providence
inn
with
some
frequency
and
would
have
done
so
regularly
in
the
evening
if
cards
which
bored
him
to
death
had
not
arrested
conversation
but
the
perpetual
foolish
variation
of
the
permutations
and
combinations
of
two
and
fifty
cards
taken
five
at
a
time
and
the
meagre
surprises
and
excitements
that
ensue
had
no
charms
for
polly
mind
which
was
at
once
too
vivid
in
its
impressions
and
too
easily
fatigued
it
was
soon
manifest
the
shop
paid
only
in
the
least
exacting
sense
and
miriam
did
not
conceal
her
opinion
that
he
ought
to
bestir
himself
and
do
things
though
what
he
was
to
do
was
hard
to
say
you
see
when
you
have
once
sunken
your
capital
in
a
shop
you
do
not
very
easily
get
it
out
again
if
customers
will
not
come
to
you
cheerfully
and
freely
the
law
sets
limits
upon
the
compulsion
you
may
exercise
you
can
not
pursue
people
about
the
streets
of
a
watering
place
compelling
them
either
by
threats
or
importunity
to
buy
flannel
trousers
additional
sources
of
income
for
a
tradesman
are
not
always
easy
to
find
wintershed
at
the
bicycle
and
gramaphone
shop
to
the
right
played
the
organ
in
the
church
and
clamp
of
the
toy
shop
was
pew
opener
and
so
forth
gambell
the
greengrocer
waited
at
table
and
his
wife
cooked
and
carter
the
watchmaker
left
things
to
his
wife
while
he
went
about
the
world
winding
clocks
but
polly
had
none
of
these
arts
and
would
in
spite
of
miriam
quietly
persistent
protests
get
any
other
and
on
summer
evenings
he
would
ride
his
bicycle
about
the
country
and
if
he
discovered
a
sale
where
there
were
books
he
would
as
often
as
not
waste
half
the
next
day
in
going
again
to
acquire
a
job
lot
of
them
haphazard
and
bring
them
home
tied
about
with
a
string
and
hide
them
from
miriam
under
the
counter
in
the
shop
that
is
a
heartbreaking
thing
for
any
wife
with
a
serious
investigatory
turn
of
mind
to
discover
she
was
always
thinking
of
burning
these
finds
but
her
natural
turn
for
economy
prevailed
with
her
the
books
he
read
during
those
fifteen
years
he
read
everything
he
got
except
theology
and
as
he
read
his
little
unsuccessful
circumstances
vanished
and
the
wonder
of
life
returned
to
him
the
routine
of
reluctant
getting
up
opening
shop
pretending
to
dust
it
with
zest
breakfasting
with
a
shop
egg
underdone
or
overdone
or
a
herring
raw
or
charred
and
coffee
made
miriam
way
and
full
of
little
particles
the
return
to
the
shop
the
morning
paper
the
standing
standing
at
the
door
saying
how
do
to
or
getting
a
bit
of
gossip
or
watching
unusual
visitors
all
these
things
vanished
as
the
auditorium
of
a
theatre
vanishes
when
the
stage
is
lit
he
acquired
hundreds
of
books
at
last
old
dusty
books
books
with
torn
covers
and
broken
covers
fat
books
whose
backs
were
naked
string
and
glue
an
inimical
litter
to
miriam
there
was
for
example
the
voyages
of
la
perouse
with
many
careful
explicit
woodcuts
and
the
frankest
revelations
of
the
ways
of
the
eighteenth
century
sailorman
homely
adventurous
drunken
incontinent
and
delightful
until
he
floated
smooth
and
slow
with
all
sails
set
and
mirrored
in
the
glassy
water
until
his
head
was
full
of
the
thought
of
shining
kindly
women
who
smiled
at
him
and
wreathed
his
head
with
unfamiliar
flowers
he
had
too
a
piece
of
a
book
about
the
lost
palaces
of
yucatan
those
vast
terraces
buried
in
primordial
forest
of
whose
makers
there
is
now
no
human
memory
with
la
perouse
he
linked
the
island
nights
entertainments
and
it
never
palled
upon
him
that
in
the
dusky
stabbing
of
the
island
of
voices
something
poured
over
the
stabber
hands
like
warm
tea
queer
incommunicable
joy
it
is
the
joy
of
the
vivid
phrase
that
turns
the
statement
of
the
horridest
fact
to
beauty
and
another
book
which
had
no
beginning
for
him
was
the
second
volume
of
the
travels
of
the
hue
and
gabet
he
followed
those
two
sweet
souls
from
their
lessons
in
thibetan
under
sandura
the
bearded
who
called
them
donkeys
to
their
infinite
benefit
and
stole
their
store
of
butter
through
a
hundred
misadventures
to
the
very
heart
of
lhassa
and
it
was
a
thirst
in
him
that
was
never
quenched
to
find
the
other
volume
and
whence
they
came
and
who
in
fact
they
were
he
read
fenimore
cooper
and
tom
cringle
log
side
by
side
with
joseph
conrad
and
dreamt
of
the
humanity
of
the
east
and
west
indies
until
his
heart
ached
to
see
those
lands
before
he
died
conrad
prose
had
a
pleasure
for
him
that
he
was
never
able
to
define
a
peculiar
deep
coloured
effect
he
found
too
one
day
among
a
pile
of
soiled
sixpenny
books
at
port
burdock
to
which
place
he
sometimes
rode
on
his
ageing
bicycle
bart
kennedy
a
sailor
tramp
all
written
in
livid
jerks
and
had
forever
after
a
kindlier
and
more
understanding
eye
for
every
burly
rough
who
slouched
through
fishbourne
high
street
sterne
he
read
with
a
wavering
appreciation
and
some
perplexity
but
except
for
the
pickwick
papers
for
some
reason
that
i
do
not
understand
he
never
took
at
all
kindly
to
dickens
yet
he
liked
lever
and
thackeray
catherine
and
all
dumas
until
he
got
to
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
i
am
puzzled
by
his
insensibility
to
dickens
and
i
record
it
as
a
good
historian
should
with
an
admission
of
my
perplexity
it
is
much
more
understandable
that
he
had
no
love
for
scott
and
i
suppose
it
was
because
of
his
ignorance
of
the
proper
pronunciation
of
words
that
he
infinitely
preferred
any
prose
to
any
metrical
writing
a
book
he
browsed
over
with
a
recurrent
pleasure
was
wanderings
in
south
america
he
would
even
amuse
himself
by
inventing
descriptions
of
other
birds
in
the
watertonian
manner
new
birds
that
he
invented
birds
with
peculiarities
that
made
him
chuckle
when
they
occurred
to
him
he
tried
to
make
rusper
the
ironmonger
share
this
joy
with
him
he
read
bates
too
about
the
amazon
but
when
he
discovered
that
you
could
not
see
one
bank
from
the
other
he
lost
through
some
mysterious
action
of
the
soul
that
again
i
can
not
understand
at
least
a
tithe
of
the
pleasure
he
had
taken
in
that
river
but
he
read
all
sorts
of
things
a
book
of
old
keltic
stories
collected
by
joyce
charmed
him
and
mitford
tales
of
old
japan
and
a
number
of
volumes
from
he
had
acquired
at
easewood
remained
a
he
developed
a
quite
considerable
acquaintance
with
the
plays
of
william
shakespeare
and
in
his
dreams
he
wore
cinque
cento
or
elizabethan
clothes
and
walked
about
a
stormy
ruffling
taverning
teeming
world
great
land
of
sublimated
things
thou
world
of
books
happy
asylum
refreshment
and
refuge
from
the
world
of
everyday
the
essential
thing
of
those
fifteen
long
years
of
shopkeeping
is
polly
well
athwart
the
counter
of
his
rather
shop
lost
in
a
book
or
rousing
himself
with
a
sigh
to
attend
to
business
meanwhile
he
got
little
exercise
indigestion
grew
with
him
until
it
ruled
all
his
moods
he
fattened
and
deteriorated
physically
moods
of
distress
invaded
and
darkened
his
skies
little
things
irritated
him
more
and
more
and
casual
laughter
ceased
in
him
his
hair
began
to
come
off
until
he
had
a
large
bald
space
at
the
back
of
his
head
suddenly
one
day
it
came
to
him
forgetful
of
those
books
and
all
he
had
lived
and
seen
through
them
that
he
had
been
in
his
shop
for
exactly
fifteen
years
that
he
would
soon
be
forty
and
that
his
life
during
that
time
had
not
been
worth
living
that
it
had
been
in
apathetic
and
feebly
hostile
and
critical
company
ugly
in
detail
and
mean
in
scope
and
that
it
had
brought
him
at
last
to
an
outlook
utterly
hopeless
and
grey
iii
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
indeed
i
have
quoted
a
certain
gentleman
living
at
highbury
wearing
a
and
writing
for
the
most
part
in
that
beautiful
room
the
library
of
the
reform
club
there
he
wrestles
with
what
he
calls
social
problems
in
a
bloodless
but
at
times
i
think
one
must
admit
an
extremely
illuminating
manner
he
has
a
fixed
idea
that
something
called
a
collective
intelligence
is
wanted
in
the
world
which
means
in
practice
that
you
and
i
and
everyone
have
to
think
about
things
frightfully
hard
and
pool
the
results
and
oblige
ourselves
to
be
shamelessly
and
persistently
clear
and
truthful
and
support
and
respect
i
suppose
a
perfect
horde
of
professors
and
writers
and
artists
and
difficult
people
instead
of
using
our
brains
in
a
moderate
sensible
manner
to
play
golf
and
bridge
pretending
a
sense
of
humour
prevents
our
doing
anything
else
with
them
and
generally
taking
life
in
a
nice
easy
gentlemanly
way
confound
him
well
this
monster
of
intellect
alleges
that
polly
was
unhappy
entirely
through
that
a
rapidly
complicating
society
he
writes
which
as
a
whole
declines
to
contemplate
its
future
or
face
the
intricate
problems
of
its
organisation
is
in
exactly
the
position
of
a
man
who
takes
no
thought
of
dietary
or
regimen
who
abstains
from
baths
and
exercise
and
gives
his
appetites
free
play
it
accumulates
useless
and
aimless
lives
as
a
man
accumulates
fat
and
morbid
products
in
his
blood
it
declines
in
its
collective
efficiency
and
vigour
and
secretes
discomfort
and
misery
every
phase
of
its
evolution
is
accompanied
by
a
maximum
of
avoidable
distress
and
inconvenience
and
human
waste
nothing
can
better
demonstrate
the
collective
dulness
of
our
community
the
crying
need
for
a
strenuous
intellectual
renewal
than
the
consideration
of
that
vast
mass
of
useless
uncomfortable
and
altogether
pitiable
people
we
contemplate
when
we
use
that
inaccurate
and
misleading
term
the
lower
middle
class
a
great
proportion
of
the
lower
middle
class
should
properly
be
assigned
to
the
unemployed
and
the
unemployable
they
are
only
not
that
because
the
possession
of
some
small
hoard
of
money
savings
during
a
period
of
wage
earning
an
insurance
policy
or
suchlike
capital
prevents
a
direct
appeal
to
the
rates
but
they
are
doing
little
or
nothing
for
the
community
in
return
for
what
they
consume
they
have
no
understanding
of
any
relation
of
service
to
the
community
they
have
never
been
trained
nor
their
imaginations
touched
to
any
social
purpose
a
great
proportion
of
small
shopkeepers
for
example
are
people
who
have
through
the
inefficiency
that
comes
from
inadequate
training
and
sheer
aimlessness
or
improvements
in
machinery
or
the
drift
of
trade
been
thrown
out
of
employment
and
who
set
up
in
needless
shops
as
a
method
of
eking
out
the
savings
upon
which
they
count
they
contrive
to
make
sixty
or
seventy
per
cent
of
their
expenditure
the
rest
is
drawn
from
the
shrinking
capital
essentially
their
lives
are
failures
not
the
sharp
and
tragic
failure
of
the
labourer
who
gets
out
of
work
and
starves
but
a
slow
chronic
process
of
consecutive
small
losses
which
may
end
if
the
individual
is
exceptionally
fortunate
in
an
impoverished
death
bed
before
actual
bankruptcy
or
destitution
supervenes
their
chances
of
ascendant
means
are
less
in
their
shops
than
in
any
lottery
that
was
ever
planned
the
secular
development
of
transit
and
communications
has
made
the
organisation
of
distributing
businesses
upon
large
and
economical
lines
inevitable
except
in
the
chaotic
confusions
of
newly
opened
countries
the
day
when
a
man
might
earn
an
independent
living
by
unskilled
or
practically
unskilled
retailing
has
gone
for
ever
yet
every
year
sees
the
melancholy
procession
towards
petty
bankruptcy
and
imprisonment
for
debt
go
on
and
there
is
no
statesmanship
in
us
to
avert
it
every
issue
of
every
trade
journal
has
its
four
or
five
columns
of
abridged
bankruptcy
proceedings
nearly
every
item
in
which
means
the
final
collapse
of
another
struggling
family
upon
the
resources
of
the
community
and
continually
a
fresh
supply
of
superfluous
artisans
and
shop
assistants
coming
out
of
employment
with
savings
or
from
relations
of
widows
with
a
insurance
money
of
the
sons
of
parsimonious
fathers
replaces
the
fallen
in
the
shops
that
everywhere
abound
i
quote
these
fragments
from
a
gifted
if
unpleasant
contemporary
for
what
they
are
worth
i
feel
this
has
come
in
here
as
the
broad
aspect
of
this
history
i
come
back
to
polly
sitting
upon
his
gate
and
swearing
in
the
east
wind
and
i
so
returning
have
a
sense
of
floating
across
unbridged
abysses
between
the
general
and
the
particular
there
on
the
one
hand
is
the
man
of
understanding
seeing
clearly
i
suppose
he
sees
clearly
the
big
process
that
dooms
millions
of
lives
to
thwarting
and
discomfort
and
unhappy
circumstances
and
giving
us
no
help
no
hint
by
which
we
may
get
that
better
collective
will
and
intelligence
which
would
dam
the
stream
of
human
failure
and
on
the
other
hand
polly
sitting
on
his
gate
untrained
unwarned
confused
distressed
angry
seeing
nothing
except
that
he
is
as
it
were
nettled
in
greyness
and
discomfort
with
life
dancing
all
about
him
polly
with
a
capacity
for
joy
and
beauty
at
least
as
keen
and
subtle
as
yours
or
mine
iv
i
have
hinted
that
our
mother
england
had
equipped
polly
for
the
management
of
his
internal
concerns
no
whit
better
than
she
had
for
the
direction
of
his
external
affairs
with
a
careless
generosity
she
affords
her
children
a
variety
of
foods
unparalleled
in
the
history
and
including
many
condiments
and
preserved
preparations
novel
to
the
human
economy
and
miriam
did
the
cooking
system
like
a
confused
and
democracy
had
been
brought
to
a
state
of
perpetual
clamour
and
disorder
demanding
now
evil
and
unsuitable
internal
satisfactions
such
as
pickles
and
vinegar
and
the
crackling
on
pork
and
now
vindictive
external
expression
war
and
bloodshed
throughout
the
world
so
that
polly
had
been
led
into
hatred
and
a
series
of
disagreeable
quarrels
with
his
landlord
his
wholesalers
and
most
of
his
neighbours
rumbold
the
china
dealer
next
door
seemed
hostile
from
the
first
for
no
apparent
reason
and
always
unpacked
his
crates
with
a
full
back
to
his
new
neighbour
and
from
the
first
polly
resented
and
hated
that
uncivil
breadth
of
expressionless
humanity
wanted
to
prod
it
kick
it
satirise
it
but
you
can
not
satirise
a
hack
if
you
have
no
friend
to
nudge
while
you
do
it
at
last
polly
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
approached
and
prodded
rumbold
ello
said
rumbold
suddenly
erect
and
turned
about
ca
we
have
some
other
point
of
view
said
polly
i
tired
of
the
end
elevation
eh
said
rumbold
frankly
puzzled
of
all
the
vertebracious
animals
man
alone
raises
his
face
to
the
sky
o
man
well
why
invert
it
rumbold
shook
his
head
with
a
helpless
expression
do
like
so
much
arreary
pensy
rumbold
distressed
in
utter
obscurity
in
fact
i
sick
of
your
turning
your
back
on
me
see
a
great
light
shone
on
rumbold
that
what
you
talking
about
he
said
that
it
said
polly
rumbold
scratched
his
ear
with
the
three
strawy
jampots
he
held
in
his
hand
way
the
wind
blows
i
expect
he
said
but
what
the
fuss
no
fuss
said
polly
passing
remark
i
do
like
it
o
man
that
all
ca
help
it
if
the
wind
blows
my
stror
said
rumbold
still
far
from
clear
about
it
it
is
ordinary
civility
said
polly
got
to
unpack
it
suits
me
ca
unpack
with
the
stror
blowing
into
one
eyes
need
unpack
like
a
pig
rooting
for
truffles
need
you
truffles
need
unpack
like
a
pig
rumbold
apprehended
something
pig
he
said
impressed
you
calling
me
a
pig
it
the
side
i
seem
to
get
of
you
said
rumbold
suddenly
fierce
and
shouting
and
marking
his
point
with
gesticulated
jampots
you
go
indoors
i
do
want
no
row
with
you
and
i
do
want
you
to
row
with
me
i
do
know
what
you
after
but
i
a
peaceable
man
teetotaller
too
and
a
good
thing
if
was
see
you
go
indoors
you
mean
to
say
i
asking
you
civilly
to
stop
unpacking
with
your
back
to
me
pig
ai
civil
and
you
ai
sober
you
go
indoors
and
on
unpacking
you
you
excited
mean
polly
was
foiled
he
perceived
an
immense
solidity
about
rumbold
get
back
to
your
shop
and
get
on
with
my
business
said
rumbold
stop
calling
me
pigs
see
sweep
your
pavemint
i
came
here
to
make
a
civil
request
you
came
to
make
a
row
i
do
want
no
truck
with
you
see
i
do
like
the
looks
of
you
see
and
i
ca
stand
all
day
arguing
see
pause
of
mutual
inspection
it
occurred
to
polly
that
probably
he
was
to
some
extent
in
the
wrong
rumbold
blowing
heavily
walked
past
him
deposited
the
jampots
in
his
shop
with
an
immense
affectation
that
there
was
no
polly
in
the
world
returned
turned
a
scornful
back
on
polly
and
dived
to
the
interior
of
the
crate
polly
stood
baffled
should
he
kick
this
solid
mass
before
him
should
he
administer
a
resounding
kick
no
he
plunged
his
hands
deeply
into
his
trowser
pockets
began
to
whistle
and
returned
to
his
own
doorstep
with
an
air
of
profound
unconcern
there
for
a
time
to
the
tune
of
men
of
harlech
he
contemplated
the
receding
possibility
of
kicking
rumbold
hard
it
would
be
splendid
and
for
the
moment
satisfying
but
he
decided
not
to
do
it
for
indefinable
reasons
he
could
not
do
it
he
went
indoors
and
straightened
up
his
dress
ties
very
slowly
and
thoughtfully
presently
he
went
to
the
window
and
regarded
rumbold
obliquely
rumbold
was
still
unpacking
polly
had
no
human
intercourse
thereafter
with
rumbold
for
fifteen
years
he
kept
up
a
hate
there
was
a
time
when
it
seemed
as
if
rumbold
might
go
but
he
had
a
meeting
of
his
creditors
and
then
went
on
unpacking
as
obtusely
as
ever
v
hinks
the
saddler
two
shops
further
down
the
street
was
a
different
case
hinks
was
the
aggressor
practically
hinks
was
a
sporting
man
in
his
way
with
that
taste
for
checks
in
costume
and
tight
trousers
which
is
under
providence
so
mysteriously
and
invariably
associated
with
equestrian
proclivities
at
first
polly
took
to
him
as
a
character
became
frequent
in
the
providence
inn
under
his
guidance
stood
and
was
stood
drinks
and
concealed
a
great
ignorance
of
horses
until
hinks
became
urgent
for
him
to
play
billiards
or
bet
then
polly
took
to
evading
him
and
hinks
ceased
to
conceal
his
opinion
that
polly
was
in
reality
a
softish
sort
of
flat
he
did
not
however
discontinue
conversation
with
polly
he
would
come
along
to
him
whenever
he
appeared
at
his
door
and
converse
about
sport
and
women
and
fisticuffs
and
the
pride
of
life
with
an
air
of
extreme
initiation
until
polly
felt
himself
the
faintest
underdeveloped
intimation
of
a
man
that
had
ever
hovered
on
the
verge
of
so
he
invented
phrases
for
hinks
clothes
and
took
rusper
the
ironmonger
into
his
confidence
upon
the
weaknesses
of
hinks
he
called
him
the
chequered
careerist
and
spoke
of
his
patterned
legs
as
shivery
shakys
good
things
of
this
sort
are
apt
to
get
round
to
people
he
was
standing
at
his
door
one
day
feeling
bored
when
hinks
appeared
down
the
street
stood
still
and
regarded
him
with
a
strange
malignant
expression
for
a
space
polly
waved
a
hand
in
a
rather
belated
salutation
hinks
spat
on
the
pavement
and
appeared
to
reflect
then
he
came
towards
polly
portentously
and
paused
and
spoke
between
his
teeth
in
an
earnest
confidential
tone
you
been
flapping
your
mouth
about
me
i
told
he
said
polly
felt
suddenly
spiritless
not
that
i
know
of
he
answered
not
that
you
know
of
be
blowed
you
been
flapping
your
mouth
do
see
it
said
polly
do
see
it
be
blowed
you
go
flapping
your
silly
mouth
about
me
and
i
give
you
a
poke
in
the
eye
see
hinks
regarded
the
effect
of
this
coldly
but
firmly
and
spat
again
understand
me
he
enquired
do
recollect
began
polly
do
recollect
be
blowed
you
flap
your
mouth
a
dam
sight
too
much
this
place
gets
more
of
your
mouth
than
it
wants
seen
this
and
hinks
having
displayed
a
freckled
fist
of
extraordinary
size
and
pugginess
in
an
ostentatiously
familiar
manner
to
close
inspection
by
sight
and
smell
turned
it
about
this
way
and
that
and
shaken
it
gently
for
a
moment
or
so
replaced
it
carefully
in
his
pocket
as
if
for
future
use
receded
slowly
and
watchfully
for
a
pace
and
then
turned
away
as
if
to
other
matters
and
ceased
to
be
even
in
outward
seeming
a
friend
vi
polly
intercourse
with
all
his
fellow
tradesmen
was
tarnished
sooner
or
later
by
some
such
adverse
incident
until
not
a
friend
remained
to
him
and
loneliness
made
even
the
shop
door
terrible
shops
bankrupted
all
about
him
and
fresh
people
came
and
new
acquaintances
sprang
up
but
sooner
or
later
a
discord
was
inevitable
the
tension
under
which
these
badly
fed
poorly
housed
bored
and
bothered
neighbours
lived
made
it
inevitable
the
mere
fact
that
polly
had
to
see
them
every
day
that
there
was
no
getting
away
from
them
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
make
them
almost
unendurable
to
his
frettingly
active
mind
among
other
shopkeepers
in
the
high
street
there
was
chuffles
the
grocer
a
small
hairy
silently
intent
polygamist
who
was
given
rough
music
by
the
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
because
of
a
scandal
about
his
wife
sister
and
who
was
nevertheless
totally
uninteresting
and
tonks
the
second
grocer
an
old
man
with
an
older
very
enfeebled
wife
both
submerged
by
piety
tonks
went
bankrupt
and
was
succeeded
by
a
branch
of
the
national
provision
company
with
a
young
manager
exactly
like
a
fox
except
that
he
barked
the
toy
and
sweetstuff
shop
was
kept
by
an
old
woman
of
repellent
manners
and
so
was
the
little
fish
shop
at
the
end
of
the
street
the
shop
having
gone
bankrupt
became
a
newspaper
shop
then
fell
to
a
haberdasher
in
consumption
and
finally
to
a
stationer
the
three
shops
at
the
end
of
the
street
wallowed
in
and
out
of
insolvency
in
the
hands
of
a
bicycle
repairer
and
dealer
a
gramaphone
dealer
a
tobacconist
a
a
shoemaker
a
greengrocer
and
the
exploiter
of
a
cinematograph
but
none
of
them
supplied
friendship
to
polly
these
adventurers
in
commerce
were
all
more
or
less
distraught
souls
driving
without
intelligible
comment
before
the
gale
of
fate
the
two
milkmen
of
fishbourne
were
brothers
who
had
quarrelled
about
their
father
will
and
started
in
opposition
to
each
other
one
was
stone
deaf
and
no
use
to
polly
and
the
other
was
a
sporting
man
with
a
natural
dread
of
epithet
who
sided
with
hinks
so
it
was
all
about
him
on
every
hand
it
seemed
were
uncongenial
people
uninteresting
people
or
people
who
conceived
the
deepest
distrust
and
hostility
towards
him
a
magic
circle
of
suspicious
preoccupied
and
dehumanised
humanity
so
the
poison
in
his
system
poisoned
the
world
without
but
boomer
the
wine
merchant
and
tashingford
the
chemist
be
it
noted
were
fraught
with
pride
and
held
themselves
to
be
a
cut
above
polly
they
never
quarrelled
with
him
preferring
to
bear
themselves
from
the
outset
as
though
they
had
already
done
so
as
his
internal
malady
grew
upon
polly
and
he
became
more
and
more
a
of
fermenting
foods
and
warring
juices
he
came
to
hate
the
very
sight
as
people
say
of
every
one
of
these
neighbours
there
they
were
every
day
and
all
the
days
just
the
same
echoing
his
own
stagnation
they
pained
him
all
round
the
top
and
back
of
his
head
they
made
his
legs
and
arms
weary
and
spiritless
the
air
was
tasteless
by
reason
of
them
he
lost
his
human
kindliness
in
the
afternoons
he
would
hover
in
the
shop
bored
to
death
with
his
business
and
his
home
and
miriam
and
yet
afraid
to
go
out
because
of
his
inflamed
and
magnified
dislike
and
dread
of
these
neighbours
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
out
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
observant
windows
and
the
cold
estranged
eyes
one
of
his
last
friendships
was
with
rusper
the
ironmonger
rusper
took
over
worthington
shop
about
three
years
after
polly
opened
he
was
a
tall
lean
nervous
convulsive
man
with
an
upturned
oval
head
who
read
newspapers
and
the
of
assiduously
had
belonged
to
a
literary
society
somewhere
once
and
had
some
defect
of
the
palate
that
at
first
gave
his
lightest
word
a
charm
and
interest
for
polly
it
caused
a
peculiar
clicking
sound
as
though
he
had
something
between
a
giggle
and
a
at
work
in
his
neck
his
literary
admirations
were
not
precisely
polly
literary
admirations
he
thought
books
were
written
to
enshrine
great
thoughts
and
that
art
was
pedagogy
in
fancy
dress
he
had
no
sense
of
phrase
or
epithet
or
richness
of
texture
but
still
he
knew
there
were
books
he
did
know
there
were
books
and
he
was
full
of
large
windy
ideas
of
the
sort
he
called
modern
kik
thought
and
seemed
needlessly
and
helplessly
concerned
about
kik
the
welfare
of
the
race
polly
would
dream
about
that
kik
at
nights
it
seemed
to
that
undesirable
mind
of
his
that
rusper
head
was
the
most
head
he
had
ever
seen
the
similarity
weighed
upon
him
and
when
he
found
an
argument
growing
warm
with
rusper
he
would
say
boil
it
some
more
o
man
boil
it
harder
or
six
minutes
at
least
allusions
rusper
could
never
make
head
or
tail
of
and
got
at
last
to
disregard
as
a
part
of
polly
general
eccentricity
for
a
long
time
that
little
tendency
threw
no
shadow
over
their
intercourse
but
it
contained
within
it
the
seeds
of
an
ultimate
disruption
often
during
the
days
of
this
friendship
polly
would
leave
his
shop
and
walk
over
to
rusper
establishment
and
stand
in
his
doorway
and
enquire
well
o
man
how
the
mind
of
the
age
working
and
get
quite
an
hour
of
it
and
sometimes
rusper
would
come
into
the
outfitter
shop
with
heard
the
kik
latest
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
morning
then
rusper
married
and
he
married
very
inconsiderately
a
woman
who
was
totally
uninteresting
to
polly
a
coolness
grew
between
them
from
the
first
intimation
of
her
advent
polly
could
help
thinking
when
he
saw
her
that
she
drew
her
hair
back
from
her
forehead
a
great
deal
too
tightly
and
that
her
elbows
were
angular
his
desire
not
to
mention
these
things
in
the
apt
terms
that
welled
up
so
richly
in
his
mind
made
him
awkward
in
her
presence
and
that
gave
her
an
impression
that
he
was
hiding
some
guilty
secret
from
her
she
decided
he
must
have
a
bad
influence
upon
her
husband
and
she
made
it
a
point
to
appear
whenever
she
heard
him
talking
to
rusper
one
day
they
became
a
little
heated
about
the
german
peril
i
lay
kik
they
invade
us
said
rusper
not
a
bit
of
it
william
not
the
zerxiacious
sort
you
see
o
man
just
what
i
sha
do
before
kik
five
years
are
out
not
it
yes
no
yes
oh
boil
it
hard
said
polly
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
rusper
standing
behind
the
counter
half
hidden
by
a
trophy
of
spades
and
garden
shears
and
a
machine
and
by
her
expression
he
knew
instantly
that
she
understood
the
conversation
paled
and
presently
polly
withdrew
after
that
estrangement
increased
steadily
rusper
ceased
altogether
to
come
over
to
the
outfitter
and
polly
called
upon
the
ironmonger
only
with
the
completest
air
of
casuality
and
everything
they
said
to
each
other
led
now
to
flat
contradiction
and
raised
voices
rusper
had
been
warned
in
vague
and
alarming
terms
that
polly
insulted
and
made
game
of
him
he
could
discover
exactly
where
and
so
it
appeared
to
him
now
that
every
word
of
polly
might
be
an
insult
meriting
his
resentment
meriting
it
none
the
less
because
it
was
masked
and
cloaked
soon
polly
calls
upon
rusper
ceased
also
and
then
rusper
pursuing
incomprehensible
lines
of
thought
became
afflicted
with
a
specialised
shortsightedness
that
applied
only
to
polly
he
would
look
in
other
directions
when
polly
appeared
and
his
large
oval
face
assumed
an
expression
of
conscious
serenity
and
deliberate
happy
unawareness
that
would
have
maddened
a
far
less
irritable
person
than
polly
it
evoked
a
strong
desire
to
mock
and
ape
and
produced
in
his
throat
a
cough
of
singular
scornfulness
more
particularly
when
rusper
also
assisted
with
an
assumed
unconsciousness
that
was
all
his
own
then
one
day
polly
had
a
bicycle
accident
his
bicycle
was
now
very
old
and
it
is
one
of
the
concomitants
of
a
bicycle
senility
that
its
free
wheel
should
one
day
obstinately
cease
to
be
free
it
corresponds
to
that
epoch
in
human
decay
when
an
old
gentleman
loses
an
incisor
tooth
it
happened
just
as
polly
was
approaching
rusper
shop
and
the
untoward
chance
of
a
motor
car
trying
to
pass
a
waggon
on
the
wrong
side
gave
polly
no
choice
but
to
get
on
to
the
pavement
and
dismount
he
was
always
accustomed
to
take
his
time
and
step
off
his
left
pedal
at
its
lowest
point
but
the
jamming
of
the
free
wheel
gear
made
that
lowest
moment
a
transitory
one
and
the
pedal
was
lifting
his
foot
for
another
revolution
before
he
realised
what
had
happened
before
he
could
dismount
according
to
his
habit
the
pedal
had
to
make
a
revolution
and
before
it
could
make
a
revolution
polly
found
himself
among
the
various
sonorous
things
with
which
rusper
adorned
the
front
of
his
shop
zinc
dustbins
household
pails
lawn
mowers
rakes
spades
and
all
manner
of
clattering
things
before
he
got
among
them
he
had
one
of
those
agonising
moments
of
helpless
wrath
and
suspense
that
seem
to
last
ages
in
which
one
seems
to
perceive
everything
and
think
of
nothing
but
words
that
are
better
forgotten
he
sent
a
column
of
pails
thundering
across
the
doorway
and
dismounted
with
one
foot
in
a
sanitary
dustbin
amidst
an
enormous
uproar
of
falling
ironmongery
put
all
over
the
place
he
cried
and
found
rusper
emerging
from
his
shop
with
the
large
tranquillities
of
his
countenance
puckered
to
anger
like
the
frowns
in
the
brow
of
a
reefing
sail
he
gesticulated
speechlessly
for
a
moment
kik
jer
doing
he
said
at
last
tin
mantraps
said
polly
jer
kik
doing
dressing
all
over
the
pavement
as
though
the
blessed
town
belonged
to
you
ugh
and
polly
in
attempting
a
dignified
movement
realised
his
entanglement
with
the
dustbin
for
the
first
time
with
a
low
embittering
expression
he
kicked
his
foot
about
in
it
for
a
moment
very
noisily
and
finally
sent
it
thundering
to
the
curb
on
its
way
it
struck
a
pail
or
so
then
polly
picked
up
his
bicycle
and
proposed
to
resume
his
homeward
way
but
the
hand
of
rusper
arrested
him
put
it
kik

kik

kik
back

you

out
of
the

rusper
laid
one
hand
on
the
bicycle
handle
and
the
other
gripped
polly
collar
urgently
whereupon
polly
said
leggo
and
again
leggo
and
then
drove
his
elbow
with
considerable
force
into
the
region
of
rusper
midriff
whereupon
rusper
with
a
loud
impassioned
cry
resembling
woo
kik
more
than
any
other
combination
of
letters
released
the
bicycle
handle
seized
polly
by
the
cap
and
hair
and
bore
his
head
and
shoulders
downward
thereat
polly
emitting
such
words
as
everyone
knows
and
nobody
prints
butted
his
utmost
into
the
concavity
of
rusper
entwined
a
leg
about
him
and
after
terrific
moments
of
swaying
instability
fell
headlong
beneath
him
amidst
the
bicycles
and
pails
there
on
the
pavement
these
inexpert
children
of
a
pacific
age
untrained
in
arms
and
uninured
to
violence
abandoned
themselves
to
amateurish
and
absurd
efforts
to
hurt
and
injure
one
another
of
which
the
most
palpable
consequences
were
dusty
backs
ruffled
hair
and
torn
and
twisted
collars
polly
by
accident
got
his
finger
into
rusper
mouth
and
strove
earnestly
for
some
time
to
prolong
that
aperture
in
the
direction
of
rusper
ear
before
it
occurred
to
rusper
to
bite
him
and
even
then
he
did
bite
very
hard
while
rusper
concentrated
his
mind
almost
entirely
on
an
effort
to
rub
polly
face
on
the
pavement
and
their
positions
bristled
with
chances
of
the
deadliest
sort
they
did
from
first
to
last
draw
blood
then
it
seemed
to
each
of
them
that
the
other
had
become
endowed
with
many
hands
and
several
voices
and
great
accessions
of
strength
they
submitted
to
fate
and
ceased
to
struggle
they
found
themselves
torn
apart
and
held
up
by
outwardly
scandalised
and
inwardly
delighted
neighbours
and
invited
to
explain
what
it
was
all
about

under
restraint
of
little
clamp
of
the
toy
shop

was
holding
his
hands
in
a
complex
and
uncomfortable
manner

he
afterwards
explained

of

romantic

something

in
their
manner

to
regard
them
as
responsible
and
intellectual
men
acting
for
the
love
of
right
and
the
enduring
good
of
the
world
they
felt
they
must
treat
this
business
as
a
profound
and
publicly
significant
affair
they
wanted
to
explain
and
orate
and
show
the
entire
necessity
of
everything
they
had
done
polly
was
convinced
he
had
never
been
so
absolutely
correct
in
all
his
life
as
when
he
planted
his
foot
in
the
sanitary
dustbin
and
rusper
considered
his
clutch
at
polly
hair
as
the
one
faultless
impulse
in
an
otherwise
undistinguished
career
but
it
was
clear
in
their
minds
they
might
easily
become
ridiculous
if
they
were
not
careful
if
for
a
second
they
stepped
over
the
edge
of
the
high
spirit
and
pitiless
dignity
they
had
hitherto
maintained
at
any
cost

perceived
they
must
not

from

piercing

with
the
sharp
horror
of
an
unexpected
woman
voice

i

i

my
husband
went
out
and
spoke
to
polly
who
was
jumping
off
his
bicycle
all
among
our
pails
and
things
and
immediately
butted
him
in
the
stomach
immediately
most
savagely
butted
him
just
after
his
dinner
too
and
him
far
from

i
could
have
screamed
but
rusper
caught
hold
of
him
right
away
i
will
say
that

said
polly
suddenly
releasing
himself
from
the
grip
and
holding
out
his

for
his
bicycle
teach
you
kik
to
leave

said
rusper
with
an
air
of
one
who
has
given
a
lesson
the
testimony
of
rusper
continued
relentlessly
in
the
background
you
hear
of
me
through
a
summons
said
polly
preparing
to
wheel
his
bicycle
kik
me
too
said
rusper
someone
handed
polly
a
collar
this
yours
polly
investigated
his

i

it

a

a
small
boy
produced
a
grimy
strip
of
spotted
blue
silk
human
life
is
safe
with
you
said
polly
as
a
parting
shot
kik
yours
is
said
rusper
and
they
got
small
satisfaction
out
of
the
bench
which
refused
altogether
to
perceive
the
relentless
correctitude
of
the
behaviour
of
either
party
and
reproved
the
eagerness
of
rusper
speaking
to
her
gently
firmly
but
exasperatingly
as
my
good
woman
and
telling
her
to
answer
the
question
answer
the
question
seems
a
pity
said
the
chairman
when
binding
them
over
to
keep
the
peace
you
ca
behave
like
respectable
tradesmen
seems
a
great
pity
bad
example
to
the
young
and
all
that
do
do
any
good
to
the

do
any

do

about
the

of
an
afternoon

we
letting
you
off
very
easily
this
time
and
hope
it
will
be
a
warning
to
you
do
expect
men
of
your
position
to
come
up
before
us
very
regrettable
affair
eh
he
addressed
the
latter
enquiry
to
his
two
colleagues
exactly
exactly
said
the
colleague
to
the
right
er
kik
said
rusper
vii
but
the
disgust
that
overshadowed
polly
being
as
he
sat
upon
the
stile
had
other
and
profounder
justification
than
his
quarrel
with
rusper
and
the
indignity
of
appearing
before
the
county
bench
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
his
business
career
short
with
his
rent
for
the
approaching
quarter
day
and
so
far
as
he
could
trust
his
own
handling
of
figures
he
was
sixty
or
seventy
pounds
on
the
wrong
side
of
solvency
and
that
was
the
outcome
of
fifteen
years
of
passive
endurance
of
dulness
throughout
the
best
years
of
his
life
what
would
miriam
say
when
she
learnt
this
and
was
invited
to
face
the
prospect
of
exile
heaven
knows
what
sort
of
exile
from
their
present
home
she
would
grumble
and
scold
and
become
limply
unhelpful
he
knew
and
none
the
less
so
because
he
could
not
help
things
she
would
say
he
ought
to
have
worked
harder
and
a
hundred
such
exasperating
pointless
things
such
thoughts
as
these
require
no
aid
from
undigested
cold
pork
and
cold
potatoes
and
pickles
to
darken
the
soul
and
with
these
aids
his
soul
was
black
indeed
may
as
well
have
a
bit
of
a
walk
said
polly
at
last
after
nearly
intolerable
meditations
and
sat
round
and
put
a
leg
over
the
stile
he
remained
still
for
some
time
before
he
brought
over
the
other
leg
kill
myself
he
murmured
at
last
it
was
an
idea
that
came
back
to
his
mind
nowadays
with
a
continually
increasing
attractiveness
more
particularly
after
meals
life
he
felt
had
no
further
happiness
to
offer
him
he
hated
miriam
and
there
was
no
getting
away
from
her
whatever
might
betide
and
for
the
rest
there
was
toil
and
struggle
toil
and
struggle
with
a
failing
heart
and
dwindling
courage
to
sustain
that
dreary
duologue
life
insured
said
polly
place
is
insured
i
do
see
it
does
any
harm
to
her
or
anyone
he
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
need
hurt
much
he
said
he
began
to
elaborate
a
plan
he
found
it
quite
interesting
elaborating
his
plan
his
countenance
became
less
miserable
and
his
pace
quickened
there
is
nothing
so
good
in
all
the
world
for
melancholia
as
walking
and
the
exercise
of
the
imagination
in
planning
something
presently
to
be
done
and
soon
the
wrathful
wretchedness
had
vanished
from
polly
face
he
would
have
to
do
the
thing
secretly
and
elaborately
because
otherwise
there
might
be
difficulties
about
the
life
insurance
he
began
to
scheme
how
he
could
circumvent
that
difficulty
he
took
a
long
walk
for
after
all
what
is
the
good
of
hurrying
back
to
shop
when
you
are
not
only
insolvent
but
very
soon
to
die
his
dinner
and
the
east
wind
lost
their
sinister
hold
upon
his
soul
and
when
at
last
he
came
back
along
the
fishbourne
high
street
his
face
was
unusually
bright
and
the
craving
hunger
of
the
dyspeptic
was
returning
so
he
went
into
the
grocer
and
bought
a
ruddily
decorated
tin
of
a
brightly
pink
fishlike
substance
known
as
deep
sea
salmon
this
he
was
resolved
to
consume
regardless
of
cost
with
vinegar
and
salt
and
pepper
as
a
relish
to
his
supper
he
did
and
since
he
and
miriam
rarely
talked
and
miriam
thought
honour
and
his
recent
behaviour
demanded
a
hostile
silence
he
ate
fast
and
copiously
and
soon
gloomily
he
ate
alone
for
she
refrained
to
mark
her
sense
of
his
extravagance
then
he
prowled
into
the
high
street
for
a
time
thought
it
an
infernal
place
tried
his
pipe
and
found
it
foul
and
bitter
and
retired
wearily
to
bed
he
slept
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
woke
up
to
the
contemplation
of
miriam
hunched
back
and
the
riddle
of
life
and
this
bright
attractive
idea
of
ending
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
all
the
things
that
were
locking
him
in
this
bright
idea
that
shone
like
a
baleful
star
above
all
the
reek
and
darkness
of
his
misery
chapter
the
eighth
making
an
end
to
things
i
polly
designed
his
suicide
with
considerable
care
and
a
quite
remarkable
altruism
his
passionate
hatred
for
miriam
vanished
directly
the
idea
of
getting
away
from
her
for
ever
became
clear
in
his
mind
he
found
himself
full
of
solicitude
then
for
her
welfare
he
did
not
want
to
buy
his
release
at
her
expense
he
had
not
the
remotest
intention
of
leaving
her
unprotected
with
a
painfully
dead
husband
and
a
bankrupt
shop
on
her
hands
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
contrive
to
secure
for
her
the
full
benefit
of
both
his
life
insurance
and
his
fire
insurance
if
he
managed
things
in
a
tactful
manner
he
felt
happier
than
he
had
done
for
years
scheming
out
this
undertaking
albeit
it
was
perhaps
a
larger
and
somberer
kind
of
happiness
than
had
fallen
to
his
lot
before
it
amazed
him
to
think
he
had
endured
his
monotony
of
misery
and
failure
for
so
long
but
there
were
some
queer
doubts
and
questions
in
the
dim
background
of
his
mind
that
he
had
very
resolutely
to
ignore
sick
of
it
he
had
to
repeat
to
himself
aloud
to
keep
his
determination
clear
and
firm
his
life
was
a
failure
there
was
nothing
more
to
hope
for
but
unhappiness
why
should
he
his
project
was
to
begin
the
fire
with
the
stairs
that
led
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
underground
kitchen
and
scullery
this
he
would
soak
with
and
assist
with
firewood
and
paper
and
a
brisk
fire
in
the
coal
cellar
underneath
he
would
smash
a
hole
or
so
in
the
stairs
to
ventilate
the
blaze
and
have
a
good
pile
of
boxes
and
paper
and
a
convenient
chair
or
so
in
the
shop
above
he
would
have
the
can
upset
and
the
shop
lamp
as
if
awaiting
refilling
at
a
convenient
distance
in
the
scullery
ready
to
catch
then
he
would
smash
the
house
lamp
on
the
staircase
a
fall
with
that
in
his
hand
was
to
be
the
ostensible
cause
of
the
blaze
and
then
he
would
cut
his
throat
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
which
would
then
become
his
funeral
pyre
he
would
do
all
this
on
sunday
evening
while
miriam
was
at
church
and
it
would
appear
that
he
had
fallen
downstairs
with
the
lamp
and
been
burnt
to
death
there
was
really
no
flaw
whatever
that
he
could
see
in
the
scheme
he
was
quite
sure
he
knew
how
to
cut
his
throat
deep
at
the
side
and
not
to
saw
at
the
windpipe
and
he
was
reasonably
sure
it
would
hurt
him
very
much
and
then
everything
would
be
at
an
end
there
was
no
particular
hurry
to
get
the
thing
done
of
course
and
meanwhile
he
occupied
his
mind
with
possible
variations
of
the
scheme
it
needed
a
particularly
dry
and
dusty
east
wind
a
sunday
dinner
of
exceptional
virulence
a
conclusive
letter
from
konk
maybrick
ghool
and
gabbitas
his
principal
and
most
urgent
creditors
and
a
conversation
with
miriam
arising
out
of
arrears
of
rent
and
leading
on
to
mutual
character
sketching
before
polly
could
be
brought
to
the
necessary
pitch
of
despair
to
carry
out
his
plans
he
went
for
an
embittering
walk
and
came
back
to
find
miriam
in
a
bad
temper
over
the
tea
things
with
the
brewings
of
of
an
hour
in
the
pot
and
hot
buttered
muffin
gone
leathery
he
sat
eating
in
silence
with
his
resolution
made
coming
to
church
said
miriam
after
she
had
cleared
away
rather
i
got
a
lot
to
be
grateful
for
said
polly
you
got
what
you
deserve
said
miriam
suppose
i
have
said
polly
and
went
and
stared
out
of
the
back
window
at
a
despondent
horse
in
the
hotel
yard
he
was
still
standing
there
when
miriam
came
downstairs
dressed
for
church
something
in
his
immobility
struck
home
to
her
you
better
come
to
church
than
mope
she
said
i
sha
mope
he
answered
she
remained
still
for
a
moment
her
presence
irritated
him
he
felt
that
in
another
moment
he
should
say
something
absurd
to
her
make
some
last
appeal
for
that
understanding
she
had
never
been
able
to
give
oh
to
church
he
said
in
another
moment
the
outer
door
slammed
upon
her
good
riddance
said
polly
he
turned
about
i
had
my
whack
he
said
he
reflected
i
do
see
she
have
any
cause
to
holler
he
said
beastly
home
beastly
life
for
a
space
he
remained
thoughtful
here
goes
he
said
at
last
ii
for
twenty
minutes
polly
busied
himself
about
the
house
making
his
preparations
very
neatly
and
methodically
he
opened
the
attic
windows
in
order
to
make
sure
of
a
good
draught
through
the
house
and
drew
down
the
blinds
at
the
back
and
shut
the
kitchen
door
to
conceal
his
arrangements
from
casual
observation
at
the
end
he
would
open
the
door
on
the
yard
and
so
make
a
clean
clear
draught
right
through
the
house
he
hacked
at
and
wedged
off
the
tread
of
a
stair
he
cleared
out
the
coals
from
under
the
staircase
and
built
a
neat
fire
of
firewood
and
paper
there
he
splashed
about
and
arranged
the
lamps
and
can
even
as
he
had
designed
and
made
a
fine
inflammable
pile
of
things
in
the
little
parlour
behind
the
shop
looks
pretty
arsonical
he
said
as
he
surveyed
it
all
would
do
to
have
a
caller
now
now
for
the
stairs
plenty
of
time
he
assured
himself
and
took
the
lamp
which
was
to
explain
the
whole
affair
and
went
to
the
head
of
the
staircase
between
the
scullery
and
the
parlour
he
sat
down
in
the
twilight
with
the
unlit
lamp
beside
him
and
surveyed
things
he
must
light
the
fire
in
the
coal
cellar
under
the
stairs
open
the
back
door
then
come
up
them
very
quickly
and
light
the
puddles
on
each
step
then
sit
down
here
again
and
cut
his
throat
he
drew
his
razor
from
his
pocket
and
felt
the
edge
it
would
hurt
much
and
in
ten
minutes
he
would
be
indistinguishable
ashes
in
the
blaze
and
this
was
the
end
of
life
for
him
the
end
and
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
life
had
never
begun
for
him
never
it
was
as
if
his
soul
had
been
cramped
and
his
eyes
bandaged
from
the
hour
of
his
birth
why
had
he
lived
such
a
life
why
had
he
submitted
to
things
blundered
into
things
why
had
he
never
insisted
on
the
things
he
thought
beautiful
and
the
things
he
desired
never
sought
them
fought
for
them
taken
any
risk
for
them
died
rather
than
abandon
them
they
were
the
things
that
mattered
safety
did
not
matter
a
living
did
not
matter
unless
there
were
things
to
live
for
he
had
been
a
fool
a
coward
and
a
fool
he
had
been
fooled
too
for
no
one
had
ever
warned
him
to
take
a
firm
hold
upon
life
no
one
had
ever
told
him
of
the
littleness
of
fear
or
pain
or
death
but
what
was
the
good
of
going
through
it
now
again
it
was
over
and
done
with
the
clock
in
the
back
parlour
pinged
the
half
hour
time
said
polly
and
stood
up
for
an
instant
he
battled
with
an
impulse
to
put
it
all
back
hastily
guiltily
and
abandon
this
desperate
plan
of
suicide
for
ever
but
miriam
would
smell
the
no
way
out
this
time
o
man
said
polly
and
he
went
slowly
downstairs
matchbox
in
hand
he
paused
for
five
seconds
perhaps
to
listen
to
noises
in
the
yard
of
the
royal
fishbourne
hotel
before
he
struck
his
match
it
trembled
a
little
in
his
hand
the
paper
blackened
and
an
edge
of
blue
flame
ran
outward
and
spread
the
fire
burnt
up
readily
and
in
an
instant
the
wood
was
crackling
cheerfully
someone
might
hear
he
must
hurry
he
lit
a
pool
of
on
the
scullery
floor
and
instantly
a
nest
of
snaky
wavering
blue
flame
became
agog
for
prey
he
went
up
the
stairs
three
steps
at
a
time
with
one
eager
blue
flicker
in
pursuit
of
him
he
seized
the
lamp
at
the
top
now
he
said
and
flung
it
smashing
the
chimney
broke
but
the
glass
receiver
stood
the
shock
and
rolled
to
the
bottom
a
potential
bomb
old
rumbold
would
hear
that
and
wonder
what
it
was
he
know
soon
enough
then
polly
stood
hesitating
razor
in
hand
and
then
sat
down
he
was
trembling
violently
but
quite
unafraid
he
drew
the
blade
lightly
under
one
ear
lord
but
it
stung
like
a
nettle
then
he
perceived
a
little
blue
thread
of
flame
running
up
his
leg
it
arrested
his
attention
and
for
a
moment
he
sat
razor
in
hand
staring
at
it
it
must
be
on
his
trousers
that
had
caught
fire
on
the
stairs
of
course
his
legs
were
wet
with
he
smacked
the
flicker
with
his
hand
to
put
it
out
and
felt
his
leg
burn
as
he
did
so
but
his
trousers
still
charred
and
glowed
it
seemed
to
him
necessary
that
he
must
put
this
out
before
he
cut
his
throat
he
put
down
the
razor
beside
him
to
smack
with
both
hands
very
eagerly
and
as
he
did
so
a
thin
tall
red
flame
came
up
through
the
hole
in
the
stairs
he
had
made
and
stood
still
quite
still
as
it
seemed
and
looked
at
him
it
was
a
flame
a
flattish
salmon
colour
redly
streaked
it
was
so
queer
and
quiet
mannered
that
the
sight
of
it
held
polly
agape
whuff
went
the
can
of
below
and
boiled
over
with
stinking
white
fire
at
the
outbreak
the
flames
shivered
and
ducked
and
then
doubled
and
vanished
and
instantly
all
the
staircase
was
noisily
ablaze
polly
sprang
up
and
backwards
as
though
the
uprushing
tongues
of
fire
were
a
pack
of
eager
wolves
good
lord
he
cried
like
a
man
who
wakes
up
from
a
dream
he
swore
sharply
and
slapped
again
at
a
recrudescent
flame
upon
his
leg
what
the
deuce
shall
i
do
i
soaked
with
the
confounded
stuff
he
had
nerved
himself
for
but
this
was
fire
he
wanted
to
delay
things
to
put
them
out
for
a
moment
while
he
did
his
business
the
idea
of
arresting
all
this
hurry
with
water
occurred
to
him
there
was
no
water
in
the
little
parlour
and
none
in
the
shop
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
whether
he
should
not
run
upstairs
to
the
bedrooms
and
get
a
ewer
of
water
to
throw
on
the
flames
at
this
rate
rumbold
would
be
ablaze
in
five
minutes
things
were
going
all
too
fast
for
polly
he
ran
towards
the
staircase
door
and
its
hot
breath
pulled
him
up
sharply
then
he
dashed
out
through
his
shop
the
catch
of
the
front
door
was
sometimes
obstinate
it
was
now
and
instantly
he
became
frantic
he
rattled
and
stormed
and
felt
the
parlour
already
ablaze
behind
him
in
another
moment
he
was
in
the
high
street
with
the
door
wide
open
the
staircase
behind
him
was
crackling
now
like
horsewhips
and
pistol
shots
he
had
a
vague
sense
that
he
was
doing
as
he
had
proposed
but
the
chief
thing
was
his
sense
of
that
uncontrolled
fire
within
what
was
he
going
to
do
there
was
the
fire
brigade
station
next
door
but
one
the
fishbourne
high
street
had
never
seemed
so
empty
far
off
at
the
corner
by
the
god
providence
inn
a
group
of
three
stiff
hobbledehoys
in
their
black
best
clothes
conversed
intermittently
with
taplow
the
policeman
hi
bawled
polly
to
them
fire
fire
and
struck
by
a
horrible
thought
the
thought
of
rumbold
deaf
upstairs
began
to
bang
and
kick
and
rattle
with
the
utmost
fury
at
rumbold
shop
door
hi
he
repeated
iii
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
great
fishbourne
fire
which
burnt
its
way
sideways
into
rusper
piles
of
crates
and
straw
and
backwards
to
the
petrol
and
stabling
of
the
royal
fishbourne
hotel
and
spread
from
that
basis
until
it
seemed
half
fishbourne
would
be
ablaze
the
east
wind
which
had
been
gathering
in
strength
all
that
day
fanned
the
flame
everything
was
dry
and
ready
and
the
little
shed
beyond
rumbold
in
which
the
local

brigade
kept
its
manual
was
alight
before
the
fishbourne
fire
hose
could
be
saved
from
disaster
in
marvellously
little
time
a
great
column
of
black
smoke
shot
with
red
streamers
rose
out
of
the
middle
of
the
high
street
and
all
fishbourne
was
alive
with
excitement
much
of
the
more
respectable
elements
of
fishbourne
society
was
in
church
or
chapel
many
however
had
been
tempted
by
the
blue
sky
and
the
hard
freshness
of
spring
to
take
walks
inland
and
there
had
been
the
usual
disappearance
of
loungers
and
conversationalists
from
the
beach
and
the
back
streets
when
at
the
hour
of
six
the
shooting
of
bolts
and
the
turning
of
keys
had
ended
the
british
ramadan
that
weekly
interlude
of
drought
our
law
imposes
the
youth
of
the
place
were
scattered
on
the
beach
or
playing
in
back
yards
under
threat
if
their
clothes
were
dirtied
and
the
adolescent
were
disposed
in
pairs
among
the
more
secluded
corners
to
be
found
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
place
several
godless
youths
seasick
but
fishing
steadily
were
tossing
upon
the
sea
in
old
tarbold
the
infidel
boat
and
the
clamps
were
entertaining
cousins
from
port
burdock
such
few
visitors
as
fishbourne
could
boast
in
the
spring
were
at
church
or
on
the
beach
to
all
these
that
column
of
smoke
did
in
a
manner
address
itself
look
here
it
said
this
within
limits
is
your
affair
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
three
hobbledehoys
had
it
been
a
weekday
and
they
in
working
clothes
might
have
felt
free
to
act
but
the
stiffness
of
black
was
upon
them
and
they
simply
moved
to
the
corner
by
rusper
to
take
a
better
view
of
polly
beating
at
the
door
the
policeman
was
a
young
inexpert
constable
with
far
too
lively
a
sense
of
the
public
house
he
put
his
head
inside
the
private
bar
to
the
horror
of
everyone
there
but
there
was
no
breach
of
the
law
thank
heaven
polly
and
rumbold
on
fire
he
said
and
vanished
again
a
window
in
the
top
story
over
boomer
shop
opened
and
boomer
captain
of
the
fire
brigade
appeared
staring
out
with
a
blank
expression
still
staring
he
began
to
fumble
with
his
collar
and
tie
manifestly
he
had
to
put
on
his
uniform
hinks
dog
which
had
been
lying
on
the
pavement
outside
wintershed
woke
up
and
having
regarded
polly
suspiciously
for
some
time
growled
nervously
and
went
round
the
corner
into
granville
alley
polly
continued
to
beat
and
kick
at
rumbold
door
then
the
public
houses
began
to
vomit
forth
the
less
desirable
elements
of
fishbourne
society
boys
and
men
were
moved
to
run
and
shout
and
more
windows
went
up
as
the
stir
increased
tashingford
the
chemist
appeared
at
his
door
in
shirt
sleeves
and
an
apron
with
his
photographic
plate
holders
in
his
hand
and
then
like
a
vision
of
purpose
came
gambell
the
greengrocer
running
out
of
alley
and
buttoning
on
his
jacket
as
he
ran
his
great
brass
helmet
was
on
his
head
hiding
it
all
but
the
sharp
nose
the
firm
mouth
the
intrepid
chin
he
ran
straight
to
the
fire
station
and
tried
the
door
and
turned
about
and
met
the
eye
of
boomer
still
at
his
upper
window
the
key
cried
gambell
the
key
boomer
made
some
inaudible
explanation
about
his
trousers
and
half
a
minute
seen
old
rumbold
cried
polly
approaching
gambell
gone
over
downford
for
a
walk
said
gambell
he
told
me
but
look
we
got
the
key
lord
said
polly
and
regarded
the
china
shop
with
open
eyes
he
the
old
woman
must
be
there
alone
he
went
back
to
the
shop
front
and
stood
surveying
it
in
infinite
perplexity
the
other
activities
in
the
street
did
not
interest
him
a
deaf
old
lady
somewhere
upstairs
there
precious
moments
passing
suddenly
he
was
struck
by
an
idea
and
vanished
from
public
vision
into
the
open
door
of
the
royal
fishbourne
tap
and
now
the
street
was
getting
crowded
and
people
were
laying
their
hands
to
this
and
that
rusper
had
been
at
home
reading
a
number
of
tracts
upon
tariff
reform
during
the
quiet
of
his
wife
absence
in
church
and
trying
to
work
out
the
application
of
the
whole
question
to
ironmongery
he
heard
a
clattering
in
the
street
and
for
a
time
disregarded
it
until
a
cry
of
fire
drew
him
to
the
window
he
the
tract
of
chiozza
money
that
he
was
reading
side
by
side
with
one
by
holt
schooling
made
a
hasty
note
bal
of
trade
say
and
went
to
look
out
instantly
he
opened
the
window
and
ceased
to
believe
the
fiscal
question
the
most
urgent
of
human
affairs
good
kik
gud
said
rusper
for
now
the
rapidly
spreading
blaze
had
forced
the
partition
into
rumbold
premises
swept
across
his
cellar
clambered
his
garden
wall
by
means
of
his
mushroom
shed
and
assailed
the
engine
house
it
stayed
not
to
consume
but
ran
as
a
thing
that
seeks
a
quarry
polly
shop
and
upper
parts
were
already
a
furnace
and
black
smoke
was
coming
out
of
rumbold
cellar
gratings
the
fire
in
the
engine
house
showed
only
as
a
sudden
rush
of
smoke
from
the
back
like
something
suddenly
blown
up
the
fire
brigade
still
much
under
strength
were
now
hard
at
work
in
the
front
of
the
latter
building
they
had
got
the
door
open
all
too
late
they
had
rescued
the
fire
escape
and
some
buckets
and
were
now
lugging
out
their
manual
with
the
hose
already
a
dripping
mass
of
molten
flaring
stinking
rubber
boomer
was
dancing
about
and
swearing
and
shouting
this
direct
attack
upon
his
apparatus
outraged
his
sense
of
chivalry
the
rest
of
the
brigade
hovered
in
a
disheartened
state
about
the
rescued
fire
escape
and
tried
to
piece
boomer
comments
into
some
tangible
instructions
hi
said
rusper
from
the
window
kik
what
up
gambell
answered
him
out
of
his
helmet
hose
he
cried
hose
gone
i
kik
got
hose
cried
rusper
he
had
he
had
a
stock
of
several
thousand
feet
of
garden
hose
of
various
qualities
and
calibres
and
now
he
felt
was
the
time
to
use
it
in
another
moment
his
shop
door
was
open
and
he
was
hurling
pails
garden
syringes
and
rolls
of
garden
hose
out
upon
the
pavement
kik
he
cried
undo
it
to
the
gathering
crowd
in
the
roadway
they
did
presently
a
hundred
ready
hands
were
unrolling
and
spreading
and
tangling
up
and
twisting
and
hopelessly
involving
stock
of
hose
sustained
by
an
unquenchable
assurance
that
presently
it
would
in
some
manner
contain
and
convey
water
and
rusper
on
his
knees
kiking
violently
became
incredibly
busy
with
wire
and
brass
junctions
and
all
sorts
of
mysteries
fix
it
to
the
kik
bathroom
tap
said
rusper
next
door
to
the
fire
station
was
mantell
and
throbson
the
little
fishbourne
branch
of
that
celebrated
firm
and
boomer
seeking
in
a
teeming
mind
for
a
plan
of
action
had
determined
to
save
this
building
someone
telephone
to
the
port
burdock
and
fire
brigades
he
cried
to
the
crowd
and
then
to
his
fellows
cut
away
the
woodwork
of
the
fire
station
and
so
led
the
way
into
the
blaze
with
a
whirling
hatchet
that
effected
wonders
in
no
time
in
ventilation
but
it
was
not
after
all
such
a
bad
idea
of
his
mantell
and
throbsons
was
separated
from
the
fire
station
in
front
by
a
covered
glass
passage
and
at
the
back
the
roof
of
a
big
outhouse
sloped
down
to
the
fire
station
leads
the
sturdy
who
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
fire
brigade
assailed
the
glass
roof
of
the
passage
with
extraordinary
gusto
and
made
a
smashing
of
glass
that
drowned
for
a
time
the
rising
uproar
of
the
flames
a
number
of
willing
volunteers
started
off
to
the
new
telephone
office
in
obedience
to
boomer
request
only
to
be
told
with
cold
official
politeness
by
the
young
lady
at
the
exchange
that
all
that
had
been
done
on
her
own
initiative
ten
minutes
ago
she
parleyed
with
these
heated
enthusiasts
for
a
space
and
then
returned
to
the
window
and
indeed
the
spectacle
was
well
worth
looking
at
the
dusk
was
falling
and
the
flames
were
showing
brilliantly
at
half
a
dozen
points
the
royal
fishbourne
hotel
tap
which
adjoined
polly
to
the
west
was
being
kept
wet
by
the
enthusiastic
efforts
of
a
string
of
volunteers
with
buckets
of
water
and
above
at
a
bathroom
window
the
little
german
waiter
was
busy
with
the
garden
hose
but
polly
establishment
looked
more
like
a
house
afire
than
most
houses
on
fire
contrive
to
look
from
start
to
finish
every
window
showed
eager
flickering
flames
and
flames
like
serpents
tongues
were
licking
out
of
three
large
holes
in
the
roof
which
was
already
beginning
to
fall
in
behind
larger
and
abundantly
gusts
of
fire
rose
from
the
fodder
that
was
now
getting
alight
in
the
royal
fishbourne
hotel
stables
next
door
to
polly
rumbold
house
was
disgorging
black
smoke
from
the
gratings
that
protected
its
underground
windows
and
smoke
and
occasional
shivers
of
flame
were
also
coming
out
of
its
windows
the
fire
station
was
better
alight
at
the
back
than
in
front
and
its
woodwork
burnt
pretty
briskly
with
peculiar
greenish
flickerings
and
a
pungent
flavour
in
the
street
an
inaggressively
disorderly
crowd
clambered
over
the
rescued
fire
escape
and
resisted
the
attempts
of
the
three
local
constables
to
get
it
away
from
the
danger
of
polly
tottering
façade
a
cluster
of
busy
forms
danced
and
shouted
and
advised
on
the
noisy
and
smashing
attempt
to
cut
off
mantell
and
throbson
from
the
fire
station
that
was
still
in
ineffectual
progress
further
a
number
of
people
appeared
to
be
destroying
interminable
red
and
grey
snakes
under
the
heated
direction
of
rusper
it
was
as
if
the
high
street
had
a
plague
of
worms
and
beyond
again
the
more
timid
and
less
active
crowded
in
front
of
an
accumulation
of
arrested
traffic
most
of
the
men
were
in
sabbatical
black
and
this
and
the
white
and
starched
quality
of
the
women
and
children
in
their
best
clothes
gave
a
note
of
ceremony
to
the
whole
affair
for
a
moment
the
attention
of
the
telephone
clerk
was
held
by
the
activities
of
tashingford
the
chemist
who
regardless
of
everyone
else
was
rushing
across
the
road
hurling
fire
grenades
into
the
fire
station
and
running
back
for
more
and
then
her
eyes
lifted
to
the
slanting
outhouse
roof
that
went
up
to
a
ridge
behind
the
parapet
of
mantell
and
throbson
an
expression
of
incredulity
came
into
the
telephone
operator
eyes
and
gave
place
to
hard
activity
she
flung
up
the
window
and
screamed
out
two
people
on
the
roof
up
there
two
people
on
the
roof
iv
her
eyes
had
not
deceived
her
two
figures
which
had
emerged
from
the
upper
staircase
window
of
rumbold
and
had
got
after
a
perilous
paddle
in
his
cistern
on
to
the
fire
station
were
now
slowly
but
resolutely
clambering
up
the
outhouse
roof
towards
the
back
of
the
main
premises
of
mantell
and
throbson
they
clambered
slowly
and
one
urged
and
helped
the
other
slipping
and
pausing
ever
and
again
amidst
a
constant
trickle
of
fragments
of
broken
tile
one
was
polly
with
his
hair
wildly
disordered
his
face
covered
with
black
smudges
and
streaked
with
perspiration
and
his
trouser
legs
scorched
and
blackened
the
other
was
an
elderly
lady
quietly
but
becomingly
dressed
in
black
with
small
white
frills
at
her
neck
and
wrists
and
a
sunday
cap
of
ecru
lace
enlivened
with
a
black
velvet
bow
her
hair
was
brushed
back
from
her
wrinkled
brow
and
plastered
down
tightly
meeting
in
a
small
knob
behind
her
wrinkled
mouth
bore
that
expression
of
supreme
resolution
common
with
the
toothless
aged
she
was
shaky
not
with
fear
but
with
the
vibrations
natural
to
her
years
and
she
spoke
with
the
slow
quavering
firmness
of
the
very
aged
i
do
mind
scrambling
she
said
with
piping
inflexibility
but
i
ca
jump
and
i
jump
scramble
old
lady
then
scramble
said
polly
pulling
her
arm
it
one
up
and
two
down
on
these
blessed
tiles
it
not
what
i
used
to
she
said
stick
to
it
said
polly
live
and

and
got
to
the
ridge
and
grasped
at
her
arm
to
pull
her
after
him
i
ca

mind
ye
she
repeated
pressing
her
lips
together
and
old
ladies
like
me
must
be
hurried
well
let
get
as
high
as
possible
anyhow
said
polly
urging
her
gently
upward
shinning
up
a
in
your
line
near
as
you
get
to
heaven
i
jump
she
said
i
can
do
anything
but
jump
hold
on
said
polly
while
i
give
you
a
boost
that
wonderful
so
long
as
it
is
jumping
the
old
lady
grasped
the
parapet
above
and
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
struggle
urup
said
polly
hold
on
gollys
where
she
gone
to
then
an
wavering
yet
very
reassuring
spring
side
boot
appeared
for
an
instant
thought
perhaps
there
was
any
roof
there
he
explained
scrambling
up
over
the
parapet
beside
her
i
never
been
out
on
a
roof
before
said
the
old
lady
i
all

here
for
a
bit
and

ten
minutes
shouted
polly
and
you

chestnut

there
ought
to
be
a
limit
to
deafness
come
on
round
to
the
front
and
see
if
we
can
find
an
attic
window
look
at
this
smoke
nasty
said
the
old
lady
her
eyes
following
his
gesture
puckering
her
face
into
an
expression
of
great
distaste
come
on
ca
hear
a
word
you
say
he
pulled
her
arm
come
on
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
relieve
herself
of
a
series
of
entirely
unexpected
chuckles
goings
on
she
said
i
never
did
where
he
going
now
and
came
along
behind
the
parapet
to
the
front
of
the
drapery
establishment
below
the
street
was
now
fully
alive
to
their
presence
and
encouraged
the
appearance
of
their
heads
by
shouts
and
cheers
a
sort
of
free
fight
was
going
on
round
the
fire
escape
order
represented
by
boomer
and
the
very
young
policeman
and
disorder
by
some
partially
intoxicated
volunteers
with
views
of
their
own
about
the
manipulation
of
the
apparatus
two
or
three
lengths
of
garden
hose
appeared
to
have
twined
themselves
round
the
ladder
polly
watched
the
struggle
with
a
certain
impatience
and
glanced
ever
and
again
over
his
shoulder
at
the
increasing
volume
of
smoke
and
steam
that
was
pouring
up
from
the
burning
fire
station
he
decided
to
break
an
attic
window
and
get
in
and
so
try
and
get
down
through
the
shop
he
found
himself
in
a
little
bedroom
and
returned
to
fetch
his
charge
for
some
time
he
could
not
make
her
understand
his
purpose
got
to
come
at
once
he
shouted
i
hai
a
time
for
years
said
the
old
lady
we
have
to
get
down
through
the
house
ca
do
no
jumpin
said
the
old
lady
no
she
yielded
reluctantly
to
his
grasp
she
stared
over
the
parapet
runnin
and
scurrying
about
like
black
beetles
in
a
kitchin
she
said
we
got
to
hurry
rumbold
a
very
quiet
man
likes
everything
quiet
be
surprised
to
see
me
why
there
is
she
fumbled
in
her
garments
mysteriously
and
at
last
produced
a
wrinkled
pocket
handkerchief
and
began
to
wave
it
oh
come
on
cried
polly
and
seized
her
he
got
her
into
the
attic
but
the
staircase
he
found
was
full
of
suffocating
smoke
and
he
dared
not
venture
below
the
next
floor
he
took
her
into
a
long
dormitory
shut
the
door
on
those
pungent
and
pervasive
fumes
and
opened
the
window
to
discover
the
fire
escape
was
now
against
the
house
and
all
fishbourne
boiling
with
excitement
as
an
immensely
helmeted
and
active
and
resolute
little
figure
ascended
in
another
moment
the
rescuer
stared
over
the
windowsill
heroic
but
just
a
trifle
and
grotesque
lawks
a
mussy
said
the
old
lady
wonders
and
wonders
why
gambell
in
that
thing
i
did
can
we
get
her
out
said
gambell
there
not
much
time
he
might
git
stuck
in
it
get
stuck
in
it
said
polly
come
along
not
for
jumpin
i
do
said
the
old
lady
understanding
his
gestures
rather
than
his
words
not
a
bit
of
it
i
bai
no
good
at
jumping
and
i
they
urged
her
gently
but
firmly
towards
the
window
you
do
it
my
own
way
said
the
old
lady
at
the
sill
i
could
do
it
better
if
e
take
it
off
oh
on
it
wuss
than
carter
stile
she
said
before
they
mended
it
with
a
cow
at
you
gambell
hovered
protectingly
below
polly
steered
her
aged
limbs
from
above
an
anxious
crowd
below
babbled
advice
and
did
its
best
to
upset
the
fire
escape
within
streamers
of
black
smoke
were
pouring
up
through
the
cracks
in
the
floor
for
some
seconds
the
world
waited
while
the
old
lady
gave
herself
up
to
reckless
mirth
again
times
she
said
and
rumbold
slowly
they
descended
and
polly
remained
at
the
post
of
danger
steadying
the
long
ladder
until
the
old
lady
was
in
safety
below
and
sheltered
by
rumbold
who
was
in
tears
and
the
young
policeman
from
the
urgent
congratulations
of
the
crowd
the
crowd
was
full
of
an
impotent
passion
to
participate
those
nearest
wanted
to
shake
her
hand
those
remoter
cheered
the
fust
fire
i
was
ever
in
and
likely
to
be
my
last
it
a
scurryin
business
but
i
real
glad
i
have
missed
it
said
the
old
lady
as
she
was
borne
rather
than
led
towards
the
refuge
of
the
temperance
hotel
also
she
was
heard
to
remark
was
saying
something
about
chestnuts
no
chestnuts
then
the
crowd
became
aware
of
polly
awkwardly
negotiating
the
top
rungs
of
the
fire
escape
comes
cried
a
voice
and
polly
descended
into
the
world
again
out
of
the
conflagration
he
had
lit
to
be
his
funeral
pyre
moist
excited
and
tremendously
alive
amidst
a
tempest
of
applause
as
he
got
lower
and
lower
the
crowd
howled
like
a
pack
of
dogs
at
him
impatient
men
unable
to
wait
for
him
seized
and
shook
his
descending
boots
and
so
brought
him
to
earth
with
a
run
he
was
rescued
with
difficulty
from
an
enthusiast
who
wished
to
slake
at
his
own
expense
and
to
his
own
accompaniment
a
thirst
altogether
heroic
he
was
hauled
into
the
temperance
hotel
and
flung
like
a
sack
breathless
and
helpless
into
the
embrace
of
miriam
v
with
the
dusk
and
the
arrival
of
some
county
constabulary
and
first
one
and
presently
two
other
fire
engines
from
port
burdock
and
the
local
talent
of
fishbourne
found
itself
forced
back
into
a
secondary
less
responsible
and
more
observant
rôle
i
will
not
pursue
the
story
of
the
fire
to
its
ashes
nor
will
i
do
more
than
glance
at
the
unfortunate
rusper
a
modern
laocoon
vainly
trying
to
retrieve
his
scattered
hose
amidst
the
tramplings
and
rushings
of
the
port
burdock
experts
in
a
small
of
the
fishbourne
temperance
hotel
a
little
group
of
fishbourne
tradesmen
sat
and
conversed
in
fragments
and
anon
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
smoking
desolation
of
their
homes
across
the
way
and
anon
sat
down
again
they
and
their
families
were
the
guests
of
old
lady
bargrave
who
had
displayed
the
utmost
sympathy
and
interest
in
their
misfortunes
she
had
taken
several
people
into
her
own
house
at
everdean
had
engaged
the
temperance
hotel
as
a
temporary
refuge
and
personally
superintended
the
housing
of
mantell
and
throbson
homeless
assistants
the
temperance
hotel
became
and
remained
extremely
noisy
and
congested
with
people
sitting
about
anywhere
conversing
in
fragments
and
totally
unable
to
get
themselves
to
bed
the
manager
was
an
old
soldier
and
following
the
best
traditions
of
the
service
saw
that
everyone
had
hot
cocoa
hot
cocoa
seemed
to
be
about
everywhere
and
it
was
no
doubt
very
heartening
and
sustaining
to
everyone
when
the
manager
detected
anyone
disposed
to
be
drooping
or
pensive
he
exhorted
that
person
at
once
to
drink
further
hot
cocoa
and
maintain
a
stout
heart
the
hero
of
the
occasion
the
centre
of
interest
was
polly
for
he
had
not
only
caused
the
fire
by
upsetting
a
lighted
lamp
scorching
his
trousers
and
narrowly
escaping
death
as
indeed
he
had
now
explained
in
detail
about
twenty
times
but
he
had
further
thought
at
once
of
that
amiable
but
helpless
old
lady
next
door
had
shown
the
utmost
decision
in
making
his
way
to
her
over
the
yard
wall
of
the
royal
fishbourne
hotel
and
had
rescued
her
with
persistence
and
vigour
in
spite
of
the
levity
natural
to
her
years
everyone
thought
well
of
him
and
was
anxious
to
show
it
more
especially
by
shaking
his
hand
painfully
and
repeatedly
rumbold
breaking
a
silence
of
nearly
fifteen
years
thanked
him
profusely
said
he
had
never
understood
him
properly
and
declared
he
ought
to
have
a
medal
there
seemed
to
be
a
widely
diffused
idea
that
polly
ought
to
have
a
medal
hinks
thought
so
he
declared
moreover
and
with
the
utmost
emphasis
that
polly
had
a
crowded
and
richly
decorated
interior
or
words
to
that
effect
there
was
something
apologetic
in
this
persistence
it
was
as
if
he
regretted
past
intimations
that
polly
was
internally
defective
and
hollow
he
also
said
that
polly
was
a
white
man
albeit
as
he
developed
it
with
a
liver
of
the
deepest
chromatic
satisfactions
polly
wandered
centrally
through
it
all
with
his
face
washed
and
his
hair
carefully
brushed
and
parted
looking
modest
and
more
than
a
little
and
wearing
a
pair
of
black
dress
trousers
belonging
to
the
manager
of
the
temperance
hotel
a
larger
man
than
himself
in
every
way
he
drifted
upstairs
to
his
and
stood
for
a
time
staring
into
the
littered
street
with
its
pools
of
water
and
extinguished
gas
lamps
his
companions
in
misfortune
resumed
a
fragmentary
disconnected
conversation
they
touched
now
on
one
aspect
of
the
disaster
and
now
on
another
and
there
were
intervals
of
silence
more
or
less
empty
cocoa
cups
were
distributed
over
the
table
mantelshelf
and
piano
and
in
the
middle
of
the
table
was
a
tin
of
biscuits
into
which
rumbold
sitting
dipped
ever
and
again
in
an
way
and
munched
like
a
distant
shooting
of
coals
it
added
to
the
solemnity
of
the
affair
that
nearly
all
of
them
were
in
their
black
sunday
clothes
little
clamp
was
particularly
impressive
and
dignified
in
a
wide
open
frock
coat
a
paper
collar
and
a
large
white
and
blue
tie
they
felt
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
a
great
disaster
the
sort
of
disaster
that
gets
into
the
papers
and
is
even
illustrated
by
blurred
photographs
of
the
crumbling
ruins
in
the
presence
of
that
sort
of
disaster
all
honourable
men
are
lugubrious
and
sententious
and
yet
it
is
impossible
to
deny
a
certain
element
of
elation
not
one
of
those
excellent
men
but
was
already
realising
that
a
great
door
had
opened
as
it
were
in
the
opaque
fabric
of
destiny
that
they
were
to
get
their
money
again
that
had
seemed
sunken
for
ever
beyond
any
hope
in
the
deeps
of
retail
trade
life
was
already
in
their
imagination
rising
like
a
phoenix
from
the
flames
i
suppose
there
be
a
public
subscription
said
clamp
not
for
those
who

i
was

of

if

if
there
was
something

him
commercial
and

answered
polly
over
his
shoulder
still
staring
out
of
the
window
oh
i
all
right
the
topic
dropped
for
a
time
though
manifestly
it
continued
to
exercise
their
minds
it
cleared
me
out
of
a
lot
of
old
stock
said
wintershed
that
one
good
thing
the
remark
was
felt
to
be
in
rather
questionable
taste
and
still
more
so
was
his
next
comment
rusper
a
bit
sick
it
did
reach
everyone
looked
uncomfortable
and
no
one
was
willing
to
point
the
reason
why
rusper
should
be
a
bit
sick
rusper
been
playing
a
game
of
his
own
said
hinks
wonder
what
he
thought
he
was
up
to
sittin
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
a
pair
of
tweezers
he
was
and
about
a
yard
of
wire
mending
somethin
wonder
he
war
run
over
by
the
port
burdock
engine
presently
a
little
chat
sprang
up
upon
the
causes
of
fires
and
polly
was
moved
to
tell
how
it
had
happened
for
the
one
and
twentieth
time
his
story
had
now
become
as
circumstantial
and
exact
as
the
evidence
of
a
police
witness
upset
the
lamp
he
said
i
just
lighted
it
i
was
going
upstairs
and
my
foot
slipped
against
where
one
of
the
treads
was
a
bit
rotten
and
down
i
went
thing
was
aflare
in
a
moment
he
yawned
at
the
end
of
the
discussion
and
moved
doorward
so
long
said
polly
good
night
said
rumbold
you
played
a
brave
man
part
if
you
do
get
a
medal
he
left
an
eloquent
pause
said
wintershed
and
clamp
o
man
said
hinks
all
said
polly
he
went
slowly
upstairs
the
vague
perplexity
common
to
popular
heroes
pervaded
his
mind
he
entered
the
bedroom
and
turned
up
the
electric
light
it
was
quite
a
pleasant
room
one
of
the
best
in
the
temperance
hotel
with
a
nice
clean
flowered
wallpaper
and
a
very
large
miriam
appeared
to
be
asleep
and
her
shoulders
were
humped
up
under
the
clothes
in
a
shapeless
forbidding
lump
that
polly
had
found
utterly
loathsome
for
fifteen
years
he
went
softly
over
to
the
and
surveyed
himself
thoughtfully
presently
he
hitched
up
the
trousers
miles
too
big
for
me
he
remarked
funny
not
to
have
a
pair
of
breeches
of
one
own
like
being
born
again
naked
came
i
into
the
world
miriam
stirred
and
rolled
over
and
stared
at
him
hello
she
said
hello
come
to
bed
it
three
pause
while
polly
disrobed
slowly
i
been
thinking
said
miriam
it
is
going
to
be
so
bad
after
all
we
shall
get
your
insurance
we
can
easy
begin
all
over
again
h
said
polly
she
turned
her
face
away
from
him
and
reflected
get
a
better
house
said
miriam
regarding
the
wallpaper
pattern
i
always
them
stairs
polly
removed
a
boot
choose
a
better
position
where
there
more
doing
murmured
miriam
not
half
so
bad
she
whispered
you
stirring
up
she
said
half
asleep
it
dawned
upon
polly
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
forgotten
something
he
ought
to
have
cut
his
throat
the
fact
struck
him
as
remarkable
but
as
now
no
longer
of
any
particular
urgency
it
seemed
a
thing
far
off
in
the
past
and
he
wondered
why
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
odd
thing
life
is
if
he
had
done
it
he
would
never
have
seen
this
clean
and
agreeable
apartment
with
the
electric
light
his
thoughts
wandered
into
a
question
of
detail
where
could
he
have
put
the
razor
down
somewhere
in
the
little
room
behind
the
shop
he
supposed
but
he
could
not
think
where
more
precisely
anyhow
it
did
matter
now
he
undressed
himself
calmly
got
into
bed
and
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
chapter
the
ninth

i
but
when
a
man
has
once
broken
through
the
paper
walls
of
everyday
circumstance
those
unsubstantial
walls
that
hold
so
many
of
us
securely
prisoned
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
he
has
made
a
discovery
if
the
world
does
not
please
you
can
change
determine
to
alter
it
at
any
price
and
you
can
change
it
altogether
you
may
change
it
to
something
sinister
and
angry
to
something
appalling
but
it
may
be
you
will
change
it
to
something
brighter
something
more
agreeable
and
at
the
worst
something
much
more
interesting
there
is
only
one
sort
of
man
who
is
absolutely
to
blame
for
his
own
misery
and
that
is
the
man
who
finds
life
dull
and
dreary
there
are
no
circumstances
in
the
world
that
determined
action
can
not
alter
unless
perhaps
they
are

will
dissolve

i
am
told
into
the
infirmary
compartment
at
any
rate
for
the
man
who
can
fast
with
resolution
i
give
these
things
as
facts
and
information
and
with
no
moral
intimations
and
polly
lying
awake
at
nights
with
a
renewed
indigestion
with
miriam
sleeping
sonorously
beside
him
and
a
general
air
of
inevitableness
about
his
situation
saw
through
it
understood
there
was
no
inevitable
any
more
and
escaped
his
former
despair
he
could
for
example
clear
out
it
became
a
wonderful
and
alluring
phrase
to
him
clear
out
why
had
he
never
thought
of
clearing
out
before
he
was
amazed
and
a
little
shocked
at
the
unimaginative
and
superfluous
criminality
in
him
that
had
turned
old
cramped
and
stagnant
fishbourne
into
a
blaze
and
new
beginnings
i
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
could
add
that
he
was
properly
sorry
but
something
constricting
and
restrained
seemed
to
have
been
destroyed
by
that
flare
was
the
that
was
the
new
the
essential
fact
of
which
he
had
lived
so
lamentably
in
ignorance
fishbourne
as
he
had
known
it
and
hated
it
so
that
he
wanted
to
kill
himself
to
get
out
of
it
the
the
insurance
money
he
was
to
receive
made
everything
humane
and
kindly
and
practicable
he
would
clear
out
with
justice
and
humanity
he
would
take
exactly
pounds
and
all
the
rest
he
would
leave
to
miriam
that
seemed
to
him
absolutely
fair
without
him
she
could
do
all
sorts
of
things
all
the
sorts
of
things
she
was
constantly
urging
him
to
do
and
he
would
go
off
along
the
white
road
that
led
to
garchester
and
on
to
crogate
and
so
to
tunbridge
wells
where
there
was
a
toad
rock
he
had
heard
of
but
never
seen
it
seemed
to
him
this
must
needs
be
a
marvel
and
so
to
other
towns
and
cities
he
would
walk
and
loiter
by
the
way
and
sleep
in
inns
at
night
and
get
an
odd
job
here
and
there
and
talk
to
strange
people
perhaps
he
would
get
quite
a
lot
of
work
and
prosper
and
if
he
did
not
do
so
he
would
lie
down
in
front
of
a
train
or
wait
for
a
warm
night
and
then
fall
into
some
smooth
broad
river
not
so
bad
as
sitting
down
to
a
dentist
not
nearly
so
bad
and
he
would
never
open
a
shop
any
more
never
so
the
possibilities
of
the
future
presented
themselves
to
polly
as
he
lay
awake
at
nights
it
was
springtime
and
in
the
woods
so
soon
as
one
got
out
of
reach
of
the
sea
wind
there
would
be
anémones
and
primroses
ii
a
month
later
a
leisurely
and
dusty
tramp
plump
equatorially
and
slightly
bald
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
lips
puckered
to
a
contemplative
whistle
strolled
along
the
river
bank
between
uppingdon
and
potwell
it
was
a
profusely
budding
spring
day
and
greens
such
as
god
had
never
permitted
in
the
world
before
in
human
memory
though
indeed
they
come
every
year
were
mirrored
vividly
in
a
mirror
of
equally
unprecedented
brown
for
a
time
the
wanderer
stopped
and
stood
still
and
even
the
thin
whistle
died
away
from
his
lips
as
he
watched
a
water
vole
run
to
and
fro
upon
a
little
headland
across
the
stream
the
vole
plopped
into
the
water
and
swam
and
dived
and
only
when
the
last
ring
of
its
disturbance
had
vanished
did
polly
resume
his
thoughtful
course
to
nowhere
in
particular
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
he
had
been
leading
a
healthy
human
life
living
constantly
in
the
open
air
walking
every
day
for
eight
or
nine
hours
eating
sparingly
accepting
every
conversational
opportunity
not
even
disdaining
the
discussion
of
possible
work
and
beyond
mending
a
hole
in
his
coat
that
he
had
made
while
negotiating
barbed
wire
with
a
borrowed
needle
and
thread
in
a
lodging
house
he
had
done
no
work
at
all
neither
had
he
worried
about
business
nor
about
time
and
seasons
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
seen
the
aurora
borealis
so
far
the
holiday
had
cost
him
very
little
he
had
arranged
it
on
a
plan
that
was
entirely
his
own
he
had
started
with
four
notes
and
a
pound
divided
into
silver
and
he
had
gone
by
train
from
fishbourne
to
ashington
at
ashington
he
had
gone
to
the
obtained
a
registered
letter
and
sent
his
four
notes
with
a
short
brotherly
note
addressed
to
himself
at
gilhampton
he
sent
this
letter
to
gilhampton
for
no
other
reason
in
the
world
than
that
he
liked
the
name
of
gilhampton
and
the
rural
suggestion
of
its
containing
county
which
was
sussex
and
having
so
despatched
it
he
set
himself
to
discover
mark
down
and
walk
to
gilhampton
and
so
recover
his
resources
and
having
got
to
gilhampton
at
last
he
changed
his
note
bought
four
pound
postal
orders
and
repeated
his
manoeuvre
with
nineteen
pounds
after
a
lapse
of
fifteen
years
he
rediscovered
this
interesting
world
about
which
so
many
people
go
incredibly
blind
and
bored
he
went
along
country
roads
while
all
the
birds
were
piping
and
chirruping
and
cheeping
and
singing
and
looked
at
fresh
new
things
and
felt
as
happy
and
irresponsible
as
a
boy
with
an
unexpected
and
if
ever
the
thought
of
miriam
returned
to
him
he
controlled
his
mind
he
came
to
country
inns
and
sat
for
unmeasured
hours
talking
of
this
and
that
to
those
sage
carters
who
rest
for
ever
in
the
taps
of
country
inns
while
the
big
sleek
brass
jingling
horses
wait
patiently
outside
with
their
waggons
he
got
a
job
with
some
van
people
who
were
wandering
about
the
country
with
swings
and
a
steam
roundabout
and
remained
with
them
for
three
days
until
one
of
their
dogs
took
a
violent
dislike
to
him
and
made
his
duties
unpleasant
he
talked
to
tramps
and
wayside
labourers
he
snoozed
under
hedges
by
day
and
in
outhouses
and
hayricks
at
night
and
once
but
only
once
he
slept
in
a
casual
ward
he
felt
as
the
etiolated
grass
and
daisies
must
do
when
you
move
the
garden
roller
away
to
a
new
place
he
gathered
a
quantity
of
strange
and
interesting
memories
he
crossed
some
misty
meadows
by
moonlight
and
the
mist
lay
low
on
the
grass
so
low
that
it
scarcely
reached
above
his
waist
and
houses
and
clumps
of
trees
stood
out
like
islands
in
a
milky
sea
so
sharply
denned
was
the
upper
surface
of
the
mistbank
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
strange
thing
that
floated
like
a
boat
upon
this
magic
lake
and
behold
something
moved
at
the
stern
and
a
rope
was
whisked
at
the
prow
and
it
had
changed
into
a
pensive
cow
regarding
him
he
saw
a
remarkable
sunset
in
a
new
valley
near
maidstone
a
very
red
and
clear
sunset
a
wide
redness
under
a
pale
cloudless
heaven
and
with
the
hills
all
round
the
edge
of
the
sky
a
deep
purple
blue
and
clear
and
flat
looking
exactly
as
he
had
seen
mountains
painted
in
pictures
he
seemed
transported
to
some
strange
country
and
would
have
felt
no
surprise
if
the
old
labourer
he
came
upon
leaning
silently
over
a
gate
had
addressed
him
in
an
unfamiliar
tongue
then
one
night
just
towards
dawn
his
sleep
upon
a
pile
of
brushwood
was
broken
by
the
distant
rattle
of
a
racing
motor
car
breaking
all
the
speed
regulations
and
as
he
could
not
sleep
again
he
got
up
and
walked
into
maidstone
as
the
day
came
he
had
never
been
abroad
in
a
town
at
two
in
his
life
before
and
the
stillness
of
everything
in
the
bright
sunrise
impressed
him
profoundly
at
one
corner
was
a
startling
policeman
standing
in
a
doorway
quite
motionless
like
a
waxen
image
polly
wished
him
good
morning
unanswered
and
went
down
to
the
bridge
over
the
medway
and
sat
on
the
parapet
very
still
and
thoughtful
watching
the
town
awaken
and
wondering
what
he
should
do
if
it
did
if
the
world
of
men
never
woke
again
one
day
he
found
himself
going
along
a
road
with
a
wide
space
of
sprouting
bracken
and
occasional
trees
on
either
side
and
suddenly
this
road
became
strangely
perplexingly
familiar
lord
he
said
and
turned
about
and
stood
it
ca
be
he
was
incredulous
then
left
the
road
and
walked
along
a
scarcely
perceptible
track
to
the
left
and
came
in
half
a
minute
to
an
old
lichenous
stone
wall
it
seemed
exactly
the
bit
of
wall
he
had
known
so
well
it
might
have
been
but
yesterday
he
was
in
that
place
there
remained
even
a
little
pile
of
wood
it
became
absurdly
the
same
wood
the
bracken
perhaps
was
not
so
high
and
most
of
its
fronds
still
uncoiled
that
was
all
here
he
had
stood
it
seemed
and
there
she
had
sat
and
looked
down
upon
him
where
was
she
now
and
what
had
become
of
her
he
counted
the
years
back
and
marvelled
that
beauty
should
have
called
to
him
with
so
imperious
a
voice
and
signified
nothing
he
hoisted
himself
with
some
little
difficulty
to
the
top
of
the
wall
and
saw
off
under
the
beech
trees
two
schoolgirls
small
insignificant
creatures
with
heads
of
blond
and
black
with
their
arms
twined
about
each
other
necks
no
doubt
telling
each
other
the
silliest
secrets
but
that
girl
with
the
red
hair
was
she
a
countess
was
she
a
queen
children
perhaps
had
sorrow
dared
to
touch
her
had
she
forgotten
altogether
a
tramp
sat
by
the
roadside
thinking
and
it
seemed
to
the
man
in
the
passing
motor
car
he
must
needs
be
plotting
for
another
pot
of
beer
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
the
tramp
was
saying
to
himself
over
and
over
again
was
a
variant
upon
a
hebrew
word
itchabod
the
tramp
was
saying
in
the
voice
of
one
who
reasons
on
the
side
of
the
inevitable
it
fair
itchabod
o
man
there
no
going
back
to
it
iii
it
was
about
two
in
the
afternoon
one
hot
day
in
high
may
when
polly
unhurrying
and
serene
came
to
that
broad
bend
of
the
river
to
which
the
little
lawn
and
garden
of
the
potwell
inn
run
down
he
stopped
at
the
sight
of
the
place
with
its
deep
tiled
roof
nestling
under
big
trees
you
never
get
a
decently
big
decently
shaped
tree
by
the
seaside
its
sign
towards
the
roadway
its
green
bench
and
tables
its
shapely
white
windows
and
its
row
of
upshooting
hollyhock
plants
in
the
garden
a
hedge
separated
it
from
a
meadow
and
beyond
stood
three
poplars
in
a
group
against
the
sky
three
exceptionally
tall
graceful
and
harmonious
poplars
it
is
hard
to
say
what
there
was
about
them
that
made
them
so
beautiful
to
polly
but
they
seemed
to
him
to
touch
a
pleasant
scene
to
a
distinction
almost
divine
he
remained
admiring
them
for
a
long
time
at
last
the
need
for
coarser
aesthetic
satisfactions
arose
in
him
provinder
he
whispered
drawing
near
to
the
inn
cold
sirloin
for
choice
and
brew
and
wheaten
bread
the
nearer
he
came
to
the
place
the
more
he
liked
it
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
were
long
and
low
and
they
had
pleasing
red
blinds
the
green
tables
outside
were
agreeably
ringed
with
memories
of
former
drinks
and
an
extensive
grape
vine
spread
level
branches
across
the
whole
front
of
the
place
against
the
wall
was
a
broken
oar
two
and
the
stained
and
faded
red
cushions
of
a
pleasure
boat
one
went
up
three
steps
to
the
door
and
peeped
into
a
broad
low
room
with
a
bar
and
beer
engine
behind
which
were
many
bright
and
helpful
looking
bottles
against
mirrors
and
great
and
little
pewter
measures
and
bottles
fastened
in
brass
wire
upside
down
with
their
corks
replaced
by
taps
and
a
white
china
cask
labelled
shrub
and
cigar
boxes
and
boxes
of
cigarettes
and
a
couple
of
toby
jugs
and
a
beautifully
coloured
hunting
scene
framed
and
glazed
showing
the
most
elegant
and
beautiful
people
taking
piper
cherry
brandy
and
cards
such
as
the
law
requires
about
the
dilution
of
spirits
and
the
illegality
of
bringing
children
into
bars
and
satirical
verses
about
swearing
and
asking
for
credit
and
three
very
bright
wax
apples
and
a
clock
but
these
were
the
mere
background
to
the
really
pleasant
thing
in
the
spectacle
which
was
quite
the
plumpest
woman
polly
had
ever
seen
seated
in
an
armchair
in
the
midst
of
all
these
bottles
and
glasses
and
glittering
things
peacefully
and
tranquilly
and
without
the
slightest
loss
of
dignity
asleep
many
people
would
have
called
her
a
fat
woman
but
polly
innate
sense
of
epithet
told
him
from
the
outset
that
plump
was
the
word
she
had
shapely
brows
and
a
straight
nose
kind
lines
and
contentment
about
her
mouth
and
beneath
it
the
jolly
chins
clustered
like
chubby
little
cherubim
about
the
feet
of
an
her
plumpness
was
firm
and
pink
and
wholesome
and
her
hands
dimpled
at
every
joint
were
clasped
in
front
of
her
she
seemed
as
it
were
to
embrace
herself
with
infinite
confidence
and
kindliness
as
one
who
knew
herself
good
in
substance
good
in
essence
and
would
show
her
gratitude
to
god
by
that
ready
acceptance
of
all
that
he
had
given
her
her
head
was
a
little
on
one
side
not
much
but
just
enough
to
speak
of
trustfulness
and
rob
her
of
the
stiff
effect
of
and
she
slept
sort
said
polly
and
opened
the
door
very
softly
divided
between
the
desire
to
enter
and
come
nearer
and
an
instinctive
indisposition
to
break
slumbers
so
manifestly
sweet
and
satisfying
she
awoke
with
a
start
and
it
amazed
polly
to
see
swift
terror
flash
into
her
eyes
instantly
it
had
gone
again
law
she
said
her
face
softening
with
relief
i
thought
you
were
jim
i
never
jim
said
polly
you
got
his
sort
of
hat
ah
said
polly
and
leant
over
the
bar
it
just
came
into
my
head
you
was
jim
said
the
plump
lady
dismissed
the
topic
and
stood
up
i
believe
i
was
having
forty
winks
she
said
if
all
the
truth
was
told
what
can
i
do
for
you
cold
meat
said
polly
there
cold
meat
the
plump
woman
admitted
and
room
for
it
the
plump
woman
came
and
leant
over
the
bar
and
regarded
him
judicially
but
kindly
there
some
cold
boiled
beef
she
said
and
added
a
bit
of
crisp
lettuce
new
mustard
said
polly
and
a
tankard
a
tankard
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
looking
for
work
asked
the
plump
woman
in
a
way
said
polly
they
smiled
like
old
friends
whatever
the
truth
may
be
about
love
there
is
certainly
such
a
thing
as
friendship
at
first
sight
they
liked
each
other
voices
they
liked
each
other
way
of
smiling
and
speaking
it
such
beautiful
weather
this
spring
said
polly
explaining
everything
what
sort
of
work
do
you
want
she
asked
i
never
properly
thought
that
out
said
polly
i
been
looking
round
for
ideas
will
you
have
your
beef
in
the
tap
or
outside
that
the
tap
polly
had
a
glimpse
of
an
oaken
settle
in
the
tap
will
be
handier
for
you
he
said
hear
that
said
the
plump
lady
hear
what
listen
presently
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
distant
howl
eh
she
said
he
nodded
that
the
ferry
and
there
is
a
ferryman
could
i
can
you
punt
never
tried
well
pull
the
pole
out
before
you
reach
the
end
of
the
punt
all
try
polly
went
out
again
into
the
sunshine
at
times
one
can
tell
so
much
so
briefly
here
are
the
facts
then
bare
he
found
a
punt
and
a
pole
got
across
to
the
steps
on
the
opposite
side
picked
up
an
elderly
gentleman
in
an
alpaca
jacket
and
a
pith
helmet
cruised
with
him
vaguely
for
twenty
minutes
conveyed
him
tortuously
into
the
midst
of
a
thicket
of
spangled
sedges
splashed
some
over
him
hit
him
twice
with
the
punt
pole
and
finally
landed
him
alarmed
but
abusive
in
treacherous
soil
at
the
edge
of
a
hay
meadow
about
forty
yards
down
stream
where
he
immediately
got
into
difficulties
with
a
noisy
aggressive
little
white
dog
which
was
guardian
of
a
jacket
polly
returned
in
a
complicated
manner
to
his
moorings
he
found
the
plump
woman
rather
flushed
and
tearful
and
seated
at
one
of
the
green
tables
outside
i
been
laughing
at
you
she
said
what
for
asked
polly
i
ai
such
a
laugh
since
jim
come
when
you
it

hurt
his
head
not
particularly
she
waved
her
head
did
you
charge
him

gratis
said
polly
i
never
thought
of
it
the
plump
woman
pressed
her
hands
to
her
sides
and
laughed
silently
for
a
space
you
ought
to
have
charged
him
sumpthing
she
said
you
better
come
and
have
your
cold
meat
before

do
any
more
puntin

and
me
get
on
together
presently
she
came
and
stood
watching
him

better
than

she
said
and
then
i
dessay
you
could
learn
to
punt
wax
to
receive
and
marble
to
retain
said
polly
this
beef
is
a
bit
of
all
right
ma
i
could
have
done
differently
if
i
had
been
punting
on
an
empty
stomach
there
a
lear
feeling
as
the
pole
goes
in
i
never
held
with
fasting
said
the
plump
woman

odd
man

place

odd

and
pickings

a
sort
of
feeling

sort
of
feeling
it
would

said
the
fat
woman
give
me
a
trial

more
than
half
a
mind
or
i
would
have
said
anything
about
it
i
suppose
you
all
right
you
got
a
sort
of
look
about
you
i
suppose
you
anything
bit
of
arson
said
polly
as
if
he
jested
so
long
as
you
have
the
habit
said
the
plump
woman
my
first
time
said
polly
munching
his
way
through
an
excellent
big
leaf
of
lettuce
and
my
last
it
all
right
if
you
have
been
to
prison
said
the
plump
woman
it
is
what

all
happen
to
do
things
at
times

a
bit
of

the
way
she
brought

cheese

polly
that
the
business
was
settled
in
her
mind
he
spent
the
afternoon
exploring
the
premises
of
the
potwell
inn
and
learning
the
duties
that
might
be
expected
of
him
such
as

can
but
try
it
said
polly
towards
tea
time
when
nothing
else
on
hand
i
suppose
i
might
do
a
bit
of
fishing
iv
polly
was
particularly
charmed
by
the
ducklings
they
were
piping
about
among
the
vegetables
in
the
company
of
their
foster
mother
and
as
he
and
the
plump
woman
came
down
the
garden
path
the
little
creatures
mobbed
them
and
ran
over
their
boots
and
in
between
polly
legs
and
did
their
best
to
be
trodden
upon
and
killed
after
the
manner
of
ducklings
all
the
world
over
polly
had
never
been
near
young
ducklings
before
and
their
extreme
blondness
and
the
delicate
completeness
of
their
feet
and
beaks
filled
him
with
admiration
it
is
open
to
question
whether
there
is
anything
more
friendly
in
the
world
than
a
very
young
duckling
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
he
tore
himself
away
to
practise
punting
with
the
plump
woman
coaching
from
the
bank
punting
he
found
was
difficult
but
not
impossible
and
towards
four
he
succeeded
in
conveying
a
second
passenger
across
the
sundering
flood
from
the
inn
to
the
unknown
as
he
returned
slowly
indeed
but
now
one
might
almost
say
surely
to
the
peg
to
which
the
punt
was
moored
he
became
aware
of
a
singularly
delightful
human
being
awaiting
him
on
the
bank
she
stood
with
her
legs
very
wide
apart
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
watching
his
gestures
with
an
expression
of
disdainful
interest
she
had
black
hair
and
brown
legs
and
a
buff
short
frock
and
very
intelligent
eyes
and
when
he
had
reached
a
sufficient
proximity
she
remarked
hello
hello
said
polly
and
saved
himself
in
the
nick
of
time
from
disaster
silly
said
the
young
lady
and
polly
lunged
nearer
what
are
you
called
polly
liar
why
i
polly
then
i
alfred
but
i
meant
to
be
polly
i
was
first
all
right
i
going
to
be
the
ferryman
i
see
you
have
to
punt
better
you
should
have
seen
me
early
in
the
afternoon
i
can
imagine
it
i
seen
the
others
what
others
polly
had
landed
now
and
was
fastening
up
the
punt
what
uncle
jim
has
scooted
scooted
he
comes
and
scoots
them
he
scoot
you
too
i
expect
a
mysterious
shadow
seemed
to
fall
athwart
the
sunshine
and
pleasantness
of
the
potwell
inn
i
not
a
scooter
said
polly
uncle
jim
is
she
whistled
a
little
flatly
for
a
moment
and
threw
small
stones
at
a
clump
of
that
sprang
from
the
bank
then
she
remarked
when
uncle
jim
comes
back
he
cut
your
insides
out
very
likely
he
let
me
see
there
was
a
pause
uncle
jim
polly
asked
in
a
faded
voice
do
you
know
who
uncle
jim
is
he
show
you
he
a
scorcher
is
uncle
jim
he
only
came
back
just
a
little
time
ago
and
he
scooted
three
men
he
do
like
strangers
about
do
uncle
jim
he
swear
he
going
to
teach
me
soon
as
i
can
whissle
properly
teach
you
to
swear
cried
polly
horrified
spit
said
the
little
girl
proudly
he
says
i
the
gamest
little
beast
he
ever
came
across
ever
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
seemed
to
polly
that
he
had
come
across
something
sheerly
dreadful
he
stared
at
the
pretty
thing
of
flesh
and
spirit
in
front
of
him
lightly
balanced
on
its
stout
little
legs
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
had
still
to
learn
the
expression
of
either
disgust
or
fear
i
say
said
polly
how
old
are
you
nine
said
the
little
girl
she
turned
away
and
reflected
truth
compelled
her
to
add
one
other
statement
he
not
what
i
should
call
handsome
not
uncle
jim
she
said
but
he
a
scorcher
and
no
mistake
gramma
do
like
him
v
polly
found
the
plump
woman
in
the
big
bricked
kitchen
lighting
a
fire
for
tea
he
went
to
the
root
of
the
matter
at
once
i
say
he
asked
who
uncle
jim
the
plump
woman
blanched
and
stood
still
for
a
moment
a
stick
fell
out
of
the
bundle
in
her
hand
unheeded
that
little
granddaughter
of
mine
been
saying
things
she
asked
faintly
bits
of
things
said
polly
well
i
suppose
i
must
tell
you
sooner
or
later
he
it
jim
he
the
drorback
to
this
place
that
what
he
is
the
drorback
i
hoped
you
might
hear
so
soon
very
likely
he
gone
do
seem
to
think
so
been
near
the
place
these
two
weeks
and
more
said
the
plump
woman
but
who
is
he
i
suppose
i
got
to
tell
you
said
the
plump
woman
she
says
he
scoots
people
polly
remarked
after
a
pause
he
my
own
sister
son
the
plump
woman
watched
the
crackling
fire
for
a
space
i
suppose
i
got
to
tell
you
she
repeated
she
softened
towards
tears
i
try
not
to
think
of
it
and
night
and
day
he
haunting
me
i
try
not
to
think
of
it
i
been
for
all
my
life
but
i
that
worried
and
afraid
with
death
and
ruin
threatened
and
evil
all
about
me
i
do
know
what
to
do
my
own
sister
son
and
me
a
widow
woman
and
against
his
doin
she
put
down
the
sticks
she
held
upon
the
fender
and
felt
for
her
handkerchief
she
began
to
sob
and
talk
quickly
i
would
mind
nothing
else
half
so
much
if
he
leave
that
child
alone
but
he
goes
talking
to
her
if
i
leave
her
a
moment
talking
to
her
teaching
her
words
and
giving
her
ideas
that
a
bit
thick
said
polly
thick
cried
the
plump
woman
it
and
what
am
i
to
do
he
been
here
three
times
now
six
days
and
a
week
and
a
part
of
a
week
and
i
pray
to
god
night
and
day
he
may
never
come
again
praying
back
he
come
sure
as
fate
he
takes
my
money
and
he
takes
my
things
he
wo
let
no
man
stay
here
to
protect
me
or
do
the
boats
or
work
the
ferry
the
ferry
getting
a
scandal
they
stand
and
shout
and
scream
and
use
language
if
i
complain
they
say
i
helpless
to
manage
here
they
take
away
my
license
out
i
shall
go
and
all
the
living
i
can
get
and
he
knows
it
and
he
plays
on
it
and
he
do
care
and
here
i
am
i
send
the
child
away
but
i
got
nowhere
to
send
the
child
i
buys
him
off
when
it
comes
to
that
and
back
he
comes
worse
than
ever
prowling
round
and
doing
evil
and
not
a
soul
to
help
me
not
a
soul
i
just
hoped
there
might
be
a
day
or
so
before
he
comes
back
again
i
was
just
hoping
i
the
sort
that
hopes
polly
was
reflecting
on
the
flaws
and
drawbacks
that
seem
to
be
inseparable
from
all
the
more
agreeable
things
in
life
biggish
sort
of
man
i
expect
asked
polly
trying
to
get
the
situation
in
all
its
bearings
but
the
plump
woman
did
not
heed
him
she
was
going
on
with
her
and
retailing
in
disconnected
fragments
the
fearfulness
of
uncle
jim
there
was
always
something
a
bit
wrong
with
him
she
said
but
nothing
you
might
have
hoped
for
not
till
they
took
him
and
carried
him
off
and
reformed
him
he
was
cruel
to
the
hens
and
chickings
it
true
and
stuck
a
knife
into
another
boy
but
then
i
seen
him
that
nice
to
a
cat
nobody
could
have
been
kinder
i
sure
he
did
do
no
to
that
cat
whatever
anyone
tries
to
make
out
of
it
i
never
listen
to
that
it
was
that
reformatory
ruined
him
they
put
him
along
of
a
lot
of
london
boys
full
of
ideas
of
wickedness
and
because
he
did
mind
pain
and
he
do
i
will
admit
try
as
i
would
they
made
him
think
himself
a
hero
them
boys
laughed
at
the
teachers
they
set
over
them
laughed
and
mocked
at
them
and
i
do
suppose
they
was
the
best
teachers
in
the
world
i
do
suppose
and
i
do
suppose
anyone
sensible
does
suppose
that
everyone
who
goes
to
be
a
teacher
or
a
or
a
warder
in
a
reformatory
home
goes
and
changes
right
away
into
an
angel
of
grace
from
heaven
and
oh
lord
where
was
i
what
did
they
send
him
to
the
reformatory
for
playing
truant
and
stealing
he
stole
right
enough
stole
the
money
from
an
old
woman
and
what
was
i
to
do
when
it
came
to
the
trial
but
say
what
i
knew
and
him
like
a
viper
at
me
more
like
a
viper
than
a
human
boy
he
leans
on
the
bar
and
looks
at
me
right
aunt
flo
he
says
just
that
and
nothing
more
time
after
time
i
dreamt
of
it
and
now
he
come
reformed
me
he
says
made
me
a
devil
and
devil
i
mean
to
be
to
you
so
out
with
it
he
says
what
did
you
give
him
last
time
asked
polly
three
golden
pounds
said
the
plump
woman
wo
last
very
long
he
says
there
ai
no
hurry
be
back
in
a
week
about
if
i
was
one
of
the
hoping
sort
she
left
the
sentence
unfinished
polly
reflected
what
sort
of
a
size
is
he
he
asked
i
not
one
of
your
herculaceous
sort
if
you
mean
that
nothing
very
wonderful
bicepitally
you
scoot
said
the
plump
woman
with
conviction
rather
than
bitterness
you
better
scoot
now
and
i
try
and
find
some
money
for
him
to
go
away
again
when
he
comes
it
ai
reasonable
to
expect
you
to
do
anything
but
scoot
but
i
suppose
it
the
way
of
a
woman
in
trouble
to
try
and
get
help
from
a
man
and
hope
and
hope
i
the
hoping
sort
how
long
he
been
about
asked
polly
ignoring
his
own
outlook
three
months
it
is
come
the
seventh
since
he
come
in
by
that
very
back
door
and
i
had
set
eyes
on
him
for
seven
long
years
he
stood
in
the
door
watchin
me
and
suddenly
he
let
off
a
yelp
like
a
dog
and
there
he
was
grinning
at
the
fright
he
given
me
old
aunty
flo
he
says
you
to
see
me
he
says
reformed
the
plump
lady
went
to
the
sink
and
filled
the
kettle
i
never
did
like
she
said
standing
at
the
sink
and
seeing
him
there
with
his
teeth
all
black
and
broken
i
did
give
him
much
of
a
welcome
at
first
not
what
would
have
been
kind
to
him
i
said
jim
jim
he
said
a
bad
shillin
like
a
damned
bad
shilling
jim
and
trouble
you
all
of
you
wanted
me
reformed
and
now
you
got
me
reformed
i
a
reformatory
reformed
character
warranted
all
right
and
turned
out
as
such
ai
you
going
to
ask
me
in
aunty
dear
in
i
said
wo
have
it
said
i
was
ready
to
be
kind
to
you
he
comes
in
and
shuts
the
door
down
he
sits
in
that
chair
come
to
torment
you
he
says
old
sumpthing
and
begins
at
me
no
human
being
could
ever
have
been
called
such
things
before
it
made
me
cry
out
now
he
says
to
show
i
ai
afraid
of
you
he
says
and
ups
and
twists
my
wrist
polly
gasped
i
could
stand
even
his
said
the
plump
woman
if
it
for
the
child
polly
went
to
the
kitchen
window
and
surveyed
his
namesake
who
was
away
up
the
garden
path
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
whisps
of
black
hair
in
disorder
about
her
little
face
thinking
thinking
profoundly
about
ducklings
you
two
ought
to
be
left
he
said
the
plump
woman
stared
at
his
back
with
hard
hope
in
her
eyes
i
do
see
that
it
affair
said
polly
the
plump
woman
resumed
her
business
with
the
kettle
i
like
to
have
a
look
at
him
before
i
go
said
polly
thinking
aloud
and
added
somehow
not
my
business
of
course
lord
he
cried
with
a
start
at
a
noise
in
the
bar
who
that
only
a
customer
said
the
plump
woman
vi
polly
made
no
rash
promises
and
thought
a
great
deal
it
seems
a
good
sort
of
crib
he
said
and
added
for
a
chap
looking
for
trouble
but
he
stayed
on
and
did
various
things
out
of
the
list
i
have
already
given
and
worked
the
ferry
and
it
was
four
days
before
he
saw
anything
of
uncle
jim
and
so
is
the
human
mind
to
things
not
yet
experienced
that
he
could
easily
have
believed
in
that
time
that
there
was
no
such
person
in
the
world
as
uncle
jim
the
plump
woman
after
her
one
outbreak
of
confidence
ignored
the
subject
and
little
polly
seemed
to
have
exhausted
her
impressions
in
her
first
communication
and
engaged
her
mind
now
with
a
simple
directness
in
the
study
and
subjugation
of
the
new
human
being
heaven
had
sent
into
her
world
the
first
unfavourable
impression
of
his
punting
was
soon
effaced
he
could
nickname
ducklings
very
amusingly
create
boats
out
of
wooden
splinters
and
stalk
and
fly
from
imaginary
tigers
in
the
orchard
with
a
convincing
earnestness
that
was
surely
beyond
the
power
of
any
other
human
being
she
conceded
at
last
that
he
should
be
called
polly
in
honour
of
her
miss
polly
even
as
he
desired
uncle
jim
turned
up
in
the
twilight
uncle
jim
appeared
with
none
of
the
disruptive
violence
polly
had
dreaded
he
came
quite
softly
polly
was
going
down
the
lane
behind
the
church
that
led
to
the
potwell
inn
after
posting
a
letter
to
the
people
at
the
he
was
walking
slowly
after
his
habit
and
thinking
discursively
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
the
muscles
he
became
aware
of
a
figure
walking
noiselessly
beside
him
his
first
impression
was
of
a
face
singularly
broad
above
and
with
a
wide
empty
grin
as
its
chief
feature
below
of
a
slouching
body
and
dragging
feet
arf
a
mo
said
the
figure
as
if
in
response
to
his
start
and
speaking
in
a
hoarse
whisper
arf
a
mo
mister
you
the
noo
bloke
at
the
potwell
inn
polly
felt
evasive
i
am
he
replied
hoarsely
and
quickened
his
pace
arf
a
mo
said
uncle
jim
taking
his
arm
we
ai
doing
a
sanguinary
marathon
it
ai
a
decorated

uncle
jim
was
certainly
not
a
handsome
person
he
was
short
shorter
than
polly
with
long
arms
and
lean
big
hands
a
thin
and
wiry
neck
stuck
out
of
his
grey
flannel
shirt
and
supported
a
big
head
that
had
something
of
the
snake
in
the
convergent
lines
of
its
broad
knotty
brow
meanly
proportioned
face
and
pointed
chin
his
almost
toothless
mouth
seemed
a
cavern
in
the
twilight
some
accident
had
left
him
with
one
small
and
active
and
one
large
and
expressionless
reddish
eye
and
wisps
of
straight
hair
strayed
from
under
the
blue
cricket
cap
he
wore
pulled
down
obliquely
over
the
latter
he
spat
between
his
teeth
and
wiped
his
mouth
untidily
with
the
soft
side
of
his
fist
you
got
to
blurry
well
shift

said
see

asked
uncle

thrust
his
face
forward
and
shook
his
open
hand
bent
like
a
claw
under
polly
nose

he
said

to
shift

polly
you

to

of

urgent
and
confidential

one
of
those
blokes
who

things
see
i
do
stick
at
nuffin
polly
manner
became
detached
and
confidential
as
though
the
matter
and
the
speaker
interested
him
greatly
but
did
concern
him
what
do
you
think
you
do
he
asked
if
you
do
clear
out
yes
said
uncle
jim
you
better
he
gripped
polly
wrist
with
a
grip
of
steel
and
in
an
instant
polly
understood
the
relative
quality
of
their
muscles
he
breathed
an
uninspiring
breath
into
polly
face
what
i
do
he
said
once
i
start
in
on
you
he
paused
and
the
night
about
them
seemed
to
be
listening
i
make
a
mess
of
you
he
said
in
his
hoarse
whisper

produced
a
oath
h
said
polly
trying
to
keep
things
light

consider
your
suggestions

better
said
uncle
jim
and
suddenly
noiselessly
was
going
his
whispering
voice
sank
until
polly
could
hear
only
the
dim
fragments
of
sentences
orrible
things
to
you
things
kick
yer
ugly
cut
yer
liver

it
all
about

will
outing

see
i
do
care
a
dead
rat
one
way
or
the
uvver
and
with
a
curious
twisting
gesture
of
the
arm
uncle
jim
receded
until
his
face
was
a
still
dim
thing
that
watched
and
the
black
shadows
of
the
hedge
seemed
to
have
swallowed
up
his
body
altogether
vii
next
morning
about
ten
polly
found
himself
seated
under
a
clump
of
fir
trees
by
the
roadside
and
about
three
miles
and
a
half
from
the
potwell
inn
he
was
by
no
means
sure
whether
he
was
taking
a
walk
to
clear
his
mind
or
leaving
that
paradise
for
good
and
all
his
reason
pointed
a
lean
unhesitating
finger
along
the
latter
course
for
after
all
the
thing
was
not
quarrel
that
agreeable
plump
woman
agreeable
motherly
comfortable
as
she
might
be
was
his
affair
that
child
with
the
mop
of
black
hair
who
combined
so
magically
the
charm
of
mouse
and
butterfly
and
flitting
bird
who
was
daintier
than
a
flower
and
softer
than
a
peach
was
no
concern
of
his
good
heavens
what
were
they
to
him
nothing
uncle
jim
of
course
a
claim
a
sort
of
claim
if
it
came
to
duty
and
chucking
up
this
attractive
indolent
observant
humorous
tramping
life
there
were
those
who
had
a
right
to
him
a
legitimate
right
a
prior
claim
on
his
protection
and
chivalry
why
not
listen
to
the
call
of
duty
and
go
back
to
miriam
now
he
had
had
a
very
agreeable
holiday
and
while
polly
sat
thinking
these
things
as
well
as
he
could
he
knew
that
if
only
he
dared
to
look
up
the
heavens
had
opened
and
the
clear
judgment
on
his
case
was
written
across
the
sky
he
knew
he
knew
now
as
much
as
a
man
can
know
of
life
he
knew
he
had
to
fight
or
perish
life
had
never
been
so
clear
to
him
before
it
had
always
been
a
confused
entertaining
spectacle
he
had
responded
to
this
impulse
and
that
seeking
agreeable
and
entertaining
things
evading
difficult
and
painful
things
such
is
the
way
of
those
who
grow
up
to
a
life
that
has
neither
danger
nor
honour
in
its
texture
he
had
been
muddled
and
wrapped
about
and
entangled
like
a
creature
born
in
the
jungle
who
has
never
seen
sea
or
sky
now
he
had
come
out
of
it
suddenly
into
a
great
exposed
place
it
was
as
if
god
and
heaven
waited
over
him
and
all
the
earth
was
expectation
not
my
business
said
polly
speaking
aloud
where
the
devil
do
come
in
and
again
with
something
between
a
whine
and
a
snarl
in
his
voice
not
my
blasted
business
his
mind
seemed
to
have
divided
itself
into
several
compartments
each
with
its
own
particular
discussion
busily
in
progress
and
quite
regardless
of
the
others
one
was
busy
with
the
detailed
interpretation
of
the
phrase
kick
you
ugly
there
a
sort
of
french
wrestling
in
which
you
use
and
guard
against
feet
watch
the
eye
and
as
his
foot
comes
up
grip
and
over
he
goes
at
your
mercy
if
you
use
the
advantage
right
but
how
do
you
use
the
advantage
rightly
when
he
thought
of
uncle
jim
the
inside
feeling
of
his
body
faded
away
rapidly
to
a
blank
discomfort
old
cadger
she
had
no
business
to
drag
me
into
her
quarrels
ought
to
go
to
the
police
and
ask
for
help
dragging
me
into
a
quarrel
that
do
concern
me
wish
i
never
set
eyes
on
the
rotten
inn
the
reality
of
the
case
arched
over
him
like
the
vault
of
the
sky
as
plain
as
the
sweet
blue
heavens
above
and
the
wide
spread
of
hill
and
valley
about
him
man
comes
into
life
to
seek
and
find
his
sufficient
beauty
to
serve
it
to
win
and
increase
it
to
fight
for
it
to
face
anything
and
dare
anything
for
it
counting
death
as
nothing
so
long
as
the
dying
eyes
still
turn
to
it
and
fear
and
dulness
and
indolence
and
appetite
which
indeed
are
no
more
than
fear
three
crippled
brothers
who
make
ambushes
and
creep
by
night
are
against
him
to
delay
him
to
hold
him
off
to
hamper
and
beguile
and
kill
him
in
that
quest
he
had
but
to
lift
his
eyes
to
see
all
that
as
much
a
part
of
his
world
as
the
driving
clouds
and
the
bending
grass
but
he
kept
himself
downcast
a
grumbling
inglorious
dirty
fattish
little
tramp
full
of
dreads
and
quivering
excuses
why
the
hell
was
i
ever
born
he
said
with
the
truth
almost
winning
him
what
do
you
do
when
a
dirty
man
who
smells
gets
you
down
and
under
in
the
dirt
and
dust
with
a
knee
below
your
diaphragm
and
a
large
hairy
hand
squeezing
your
windpipe
tighter
and
tighter
in
a
quarrel
that
is
properly
speaking
yours
if
i
had
a
chance
against
him
protested
polly
it
no
good
you
see
said
polly
he
stood
up
as
though
his
decision
was
made
and
was
for
an
instant
struck
still
by
doubt
there
lay
the
road
before
him
going
this
way
to
the
east
and
that
to
the
west
westward
one
hour
away
now
was
the
potwell
inn
already
things
might
be
happening
there
eastward
was
the
wise
man
course
a
road
dipping
between
hedges
to
a
hop
garden
and
a
wood
and
presently
no
doubt
reaching
an
inn
a
picturesque
church
perhaps
a
village
and
fresh
company
the
wise
man
course
polly
saw
himself
going
along
it
and
tried
to
see
himself
going
along
it
with
all
the
a
wise
man
feels
but
somehow
it
would
come
like
that
the
wise
man
fell
short
of
happiness
for
all
his
wisdom
the
wise
man
had
a
paunch
and
round
shoulders
and
red
ears
and
excuses
it
was
a
pleasant
road
and
why
the
wise
man
should
not
go
along
it
merry
and
singing
full
of
summer
happiness
was
a
miracle
to
polly
mind
but
confound
it
the
fact
remained
the
figure
went
slinking
slinking
was
the
only
word
for
it
and
would
not
go
otherwise
than
slinking
he
turned
his
eyes
westward
as
if
for
an
explanation
and
if
the
figure
was
no
longer
ignoble
the
prospect
was
appalling
one
kick
in
the
stummick
would
settle
a
chap
like
me
said
polly
oh
god
cried
polly
and
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
said
for
the
last
time
in
that
struggle
it
is
my
affair
and
so
saying
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
potwell
inn
he
went
back
neither
halting
nor
hastening
in
his
pace
after
this
last
decision
but
with
a
mind
feverishly
busy
if
i
get
killed
i
get
killed
and
if
he
gets
killed
i
get
hung
do
seem
just
somehow
do
suppose
i
shall
him
off
viii
the
private
war
between
polly
and
uncle
jim
for
the
possession
of
the
potwell
inn
fell
naturally
into
three
chief
campaigns
there
was
first
of
all
the
great
campaign
which
ended
in
the
triumphant
eviction
of
uncle
jim
from
the
inn
premises
there
came
next
after
a
brief
interval
the
futile
invasions
of
the
premises
by
uncle
jim
that
culminated
in
the
battle
of
the
dead
eel
and
after
some
months
of
involuntary
truce
there
was
the
last
supreme
conflict
of
the
night
surprise
each
of
these
campaigns
merits
a
section
to
itself
polly
the
inn
discreetly
he
found
the
plump
woman
seated
in
her
bar
her
eyes
her
face
white
and
wet
with
tears
o
god
she
was
saying
over
and
over
again
o
god
the
air
was
full
of
a
spirituous
reek
and
on
the
sanded
boards
in
front
of
the
bar
were
the
fragments
of
a
broken
bottle
and
an
overturned
glass
she
turned
her
despair
at
the
sound
of
his
entry
and
despair
gave
place
to
astonishment
you
come
back
she
said
said
polly
he
he
mad
drunk
and
looking
for
her
where
is
she
locked
upstairs
have
you
sent
to
the
police
no
one
to
send
i
see
to
it
said
polly
out
this
way
she
nodded
he
went
to
the
crinkly
paned
window
and
peered
out
uncle
jim
was
coming
down
the
garden
path
towards
the
house
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
singing
hoarsely
polly
remembered
afterwards
with
pride
and
amazement
that
he
felt
neither
faint
nor
rigid
he
glanced
round
him
seized
a
bottle
of
beer
by
the
neck
as
an
improvised
club
and
went
out
by
the
garden
door
uncle
jim
stopped
amazed
his
brain
did
not
instantly
rise
to
the
new
posture
of
things
you
he
cried
and
stopped
for
a
moment
you
job
said
polly
and
advanced
some
paces
uncle
jim
stood
swaying
with
wrathful
astonishment
and
then
darted
forward
with
clutching
hands
polly
felt
that
if
his
antagonist
closed
he
was
lost
and
smote
with
all
his
force
at
the
ugly
head
before
him
smash
went
the
bottle
and
uncle
jim
staggered
by
the
blow
and
blinded
with
beer
the
lapses
and
leaps
of
the
human
mind
are
for
ever
mysterious
polly
had
never
expected
that
bottle
to
break
in
the
instant
he
felt
disarmed
and
helpless
before
him
was
uncle
jim
infuriated
and
evidently
still
coming
on
and
for
defence
was
nothing
but
the
neck
of
a
bottle
for
a
time
our
polly
has
figured
heroic
now
comes
the
fall
again
he
sounded
abject
terror
he
dropped
that
ineffectual
scrap
of
glass
and
turned
and
fled
round
the
corner
of
the
house
bolls
came
the
thick
voice
of
the
enemy
behind
him
as
one
who
accepts
a
challenge
and
bleeding
but
indomitable
uncle
jim
entered
the
house
bolls
he
said
surveying
the
bar
fightin
with
bolls
i
show
fightin
with
bolls
uncle
jim
had
learnt
all
about
fighting
with
bottles
in
the
reformatory
home
regardless
of
his
aunt
he
ranged
among
the
bottled
beer
and
succeeded
after
one
or
two
failures
in
preparing
two
bottles
to
his
satisfaction
by
knocking
off
the
bottoms
and
gripping
them
by
the
necks
so
prepared
he
went
forth
again
to
destroy
polly
polly
freed
from
the
sense
of
urgent
pursuit
had
halted
beyond
the
raspberry
canes
and
rallied
his
courage
the
sense
of
uncle
jim
victorious
in
the
house
restored
his
manhood
he
went
round
by
the
outhouses
to
the
riverside
seeking
a
weapon
and
found
an
old
paddle
boat
hook
with
this
he
smote
uncle
jim
as
he
emerged
by
the
door
of
the
tap
uncle
jim
blaspheming
dreadfully
and
with
dire
stabbing
intimations
in
either
hand
came
through
the
splintering
paddle
like
a
circus
rider
through
a
paper
hoop
and
once
more
polly
dropped
his
weapon
and
fled
a
careless
observer
watching
him
sprint
round
and
round
the
inn
in
front
of
the
lumbering
and
reproachful
pursuit
of
uncle
jim
might
have
formed
an
altogether
erroneous
estimate
of
the
issue
of
the
campaign
certain
compensating
qualities
of
the
very
greatest
military
value
were
appearing
in
polly
even
as
he
ran
if
uncle
jim
had
strength
and
brute
courage
and
the
rich
toughening
experience
a
reformatory
home
affords
polly
was
nevertheless
sober
more
mobile
and
with
a
mind
now
stimulated
to
an
almost
incredible
nimbleness
so
that
he
not
only
gained
on
uncle
jim
but
thought
what
use
he
might
make
of
this
advantage
the
word
strategious
flamed
red
across
the
tumult
of
his
mind
as
he
came
round
the
house
for
the
third
time
he
darted
suddenly
into
the
yard
swung
the
door
to
behind
himself
and
bolted
it
seized
the
zinc
pig
pail
that
stood
by
the
entrance
to
the
kitchen
and
had
it
neatly
and
resonantly
over
uncle
jim
head
as
he
came
belatedly
in
round
the
outhouse
on
the
other
side
one
of
the
splintered
bottles
jabbed
polly
ear
at
the
time
it
seemed
of
no
importance
and
then
uncle
jim
was
down
and
writhing
dangerously
and
noisily
upon
the
yard
tiles
with
his
head
still
in
the
pig
pail
and
his
bottles
gone
to
splinters
and
polly
was
fastening
the
kitchen
door
against
him
ca
go
on
like
this
for
ever
said
polly
whooping
for
breath
and
selecting
a
weapon
from
among
the
brooms
that
stood
behind
the
kitchen
door
uncle
jim
was
losing
his
head
he
was
up
and
kicking
the
door
and
bellowing
unamiable
proposals
and
invitations
so
that
a
strategist
emerging
silently
by
the
tap
door
could
locate
him
without
difficulty
steal
upon
him
unawares
and
but
before
that
felling
blow
could
be
delivered
uncle
jim
ear
had
caught
a
footfall
and
he
turned
polly
quailed
and
lowered
his
broom
a
fatal
hesitation
i
got
you
cried
uncle
jim
dancing
forward
in
a
disconcerting
zigzag
he
rushed
to
close
and
polly
stopped
him
neatly
as
it
were
a
miracle
with
the
head
of
the
broom
across
his
chest
uncle
jim
seized
the
broom
with
both
hands
he
said
and
tugged
polly
shook
his
head
tugged
and
showed
pale
compressed
lips
both
tugged
then
uncle
jim
tried
to
get
round
the
end
of
the
broom
polly
circled
away
they
began
to
circle
about
one
another
both
tugging
hard
both
intensely
watchful
of
the
slightest
initiative
on
the
part
of
the
other
polly
wished
brooms
were
longer
twelve
or
thirteen
feet
for
example
uncle
jim
was
clearly
for
shortness
in
brooms
he
wasted
breath
in
saying
what
was
to
happen
shortly
sanguinary
oriental
things
when
the
broom
no
longer
separated
them
polly
thought
he
had
never
seen
an
uglier
person
suddenly
uncle
jim
flashed
into
violent
activity
but
alcohol
slows
movement
and
polly
was
equal
to
him
then
uncle
jim
tried
jerks
and
for
a
terrible
instant
seemed
to
have
the
broom
out
of
polly
hands
but
polly
recovered
it
with
the
clutch
of
a
drowning
man
then
uncle
jim
drove
suddenly
at
polly
midriff
but
again
polly
was
ready
and
swept
him
round
in
a
circle
then
suddenly
a
wild
hope
filled
polly
he
saw
the
river
was
very
near
the
post
to
which
the
punt
was
tied
not
three
yards
away
with
a
wild
yell
he
sent
the
broom
home
into
his
antagonist
ribs
woosh
he
cried
as
the
resistance
gave
oh
said
uncle
jim
going
backward
helplessly
and
polly
thrust
hard
and
abandoned
the
broom
to
the
enemy
despairing
clutch
splash
uncle
jim
was
in
the
water
and
polly
had
leapt
like
a
cat
aboard
the
ferry
punt
and
grasped
the
pole
up
came
uncle
jim
spluttering
and
dripping
you
unprofitable
matter
and
printing
it
would
lead
to
a
censorship
of
novels
you
know
i
got
a
weak
the
pole
took
him
in
the
throat
and
drove
him
backward
and
downwards
lea
go
cried
uncle
jim
staggering
and
with
real
terror
in
his
once
awful
eyes
splash
down
he
fell
backwards
into
a
frothing
mass
of
water
with
polly
jabbing
at
him
under
water
he
turned
round
and
came
up
again
as
if
in
flight
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
directly
his
head
reappeared
polly
had
him
between
the
shoulders
and
under
again
bubbling
thickly
a
hand
clutched
and
disappeared
it
was
stupendous
polly
had
discovered
the
heel
of
achilles
uncle
jim
had
no
stomach
for
cold
water
the
broom
floated
away
pitching
gently
on
the
swell
polly
infuriated
with
victory
thrust
uncle
jim
under
again
and
drove
the
punt
round
on
its
chain
in
such
a
manner
that
when
uncle
jim
came
up
for
the
fourth
time
and
now
he
was
nearly
out
of
his
depth
too
buoyed
up
to
walk
and
apparently
nearly
helpless
polly
fortunately
for
them
both
could
not
reach
him
uncle
jim
made
the
clumsy
gestures
of
those
who
struggle
insecurely
in
the
water
keep
out
said
polly
uncle
jim
with
a
great
effort
got
a
footing
emerged
until
his
were
out
of
water
until
his
waistcoat
buttons
showed
one
by
one
till
scarcely
two
remained
and
made
for
the
camp
sheeting
keep
out
cried
polly
and
leapt
off
the
punt
and
followed
the
movements
of
his
victim
along
the
shore
i
tell
you
i
got
a
weak
chess
said
uncle
jim
moistly
this
fair
fightin
keep
out
said
polly
this
ai
fair
fightin
said
uncle
jim
almost
weeping
and
all
his
terrors
had
gone
keep
out
said
polly
with
an
accurately
poised
pole
i
tell
you
i
got
to
land
you
fool
said
uncle
jim
with
a
sort
of
despairing
wrathfulness
and
began
moving
you
keep
out
said
polly
in
parallel
movement
do
you
ever
land
on
this
place
again
slowly
argumentatively
and
reluctantly
uncle
jim
waded
he
tried
threats
he
tried
persuasion
he
even
tried
a
belated
note
of
pathos
polly
remained
inexorable
if
in
secret
a
little
perplexed
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
situation
this
cold
getting
to
my
said
uncle
jim
you
want
cooling
you
keep
out
in
it
said
polly
they
came
round
the
bend
into
sight
of
nicholson
ait
where
the
backwater
runs
down
to
the
potwell
mill
and
there
after
much
parley
and
several
feints
uncle
jim
made
a
desperate
effort
and
struggled
into
clutch
of
the
overhanging
on
the
island
and
so
got
out
of
the
water
with
the
millstream
between
them
he
emerged
dripping
and
muddy
and
vindictive
by
he
said
i
skin
you
for
this
you
keep
off
or
i
do
worse
to
you
said
polly
the
spirit
was
out
of
uncle
jim
for
the
time
and
he
turned
away
to
struggle
through
the
towards
the
mill
leaving
a
shining
trail
of
water
among
the
stems
polly
returned
slowly
and
thoughtfully
to
the
inn
and
suddenly
his
mind
began
to
bubble
with
phrases
the
plump
woman
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
inn
door
to
greet
him
law
she
cried
as
he
drew
near
killed
you
do
i
look
like
it
said
polly
but
where
jim
gone
off
was
mad
drunk
and
dangerous
i
put
him
in
the
river
said
polly
that
toned
down
his
alcolaceous
frenzy
i
gave
him
a
bit
of
a
doing
altogether
hai
he
you
not
a
bit
of
it
then
what
all
that
blood
beside
your
ear
polly
felt
quite
a
cut
funny
how
one
overlooks
things
heated
moments
he
must
have
done
that
when
he
jabbed
about
with
those
bottles
hullo
kiddy
you
venturing
downstairs
again
ai
he
killed
you
asked
the
little
girl
well
i
wish
i
seen
more
of
the
fighting
did
you
all
i
saw
was
you
running
round
the
house
and
uncle
jim
after
you
there
was
a
little
pause
i
was
leading
him
on
said
polly
someone
shouting
at
the
ferry
she
said
right
o
but
you
wo
see
any
more
of
uncle
jim
for
a
bit
been
having
a
about
that
i
believe
it
uncle
jim
said
the
little
girl
then
he
can
wait
said
polly
shortly
he
turned
round
and
listened
for
the
words
that
drifted
across
from
the
little
figure
on
the
opposite
bank
so
far
as
he
could
judge
uncle
jim
was
making
an
appointment
for
the
morrow
he
replied
with
a
defiant
movement
of
the
punt
pole
the
little
figure
was
convulsed
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
its
way
upstream
fiercely
so
it
was
the
first
campaign
ended
in
an
insecure
victory
ix
the
next
day
was
wednesday
and
a
slack
day
for
the
potwell
inn
it
was
a
hot
close
day
full
of
the
murmuring
of
bees
one
or
two
people
crossed
by
the
ferry
an
elaborately
equipped
fisherman
stopped
for
cold
meat
and
dry
ginger
ale
in
the
bar
parlour
some
haymakers
came
and
drank
beer
for
an
hour
and
afterwards
sent
jars
and
jugs
by
a
boy
to
be
replenished
that
was
all
polly
had
risen
early
and
was
busy
about
the
place
meditating
upon
the
probable
tactics
of
uncle
jim
he
was
no
longer
strung
up
to
the
desperate
pitch
of
the
first
encounter
but
he
was
grave
and
anxious
uncle
jim
had
shrunken
as
all
antagonists
that
are
boldly
faced
shrink
after
the
first
battle
to
the
negotiable
the
vulnerable
formidable
he
was
no
doubt
but
not
invincible
he
had
under
providence
been
defeated
once
and
he
might
be
defeated
altogether
polly
went
about
the
place
considering
the
militant
possibilities
of
pacific
things
copper
sticks
garden
implements
kitchen
knives
garden
nets
barbed
wire
oars
clothes
lines
blankets
pewter
pots
stockings
and
broken
bottles
he
prepared
a
club
with
a
stocking
and
a
bottle
inside
upon
the
best
east
end
model
he
swung
it
round
his
head
once
broke
an
outhouse
window
with
a
flying
fragment
of
glass
and
ruined
the
stocking
beyond
all
darning
he
developed
a
subtle
scheme
with
the
cellar
flap
as
a
sort
of
pitfall
but
he
rejected
it
finally
because
a
it
might
entrap
the
plump
woman
and
b
he
had
no
use
whatever
for
uncle
jim
in
the
cellar
he
determined
to
wire
the
garden
that
evening
burglar
fashion
against
the
possibilities
of
a
night
attack
towards
two
in
the
afternoon
three
young
men
arrived
in
a
capacious
boat
from
the
direction
of
lammam
and
asked
permission
to
camp
in
the
paddock
it
was
given
all
the
more
readily
by
polly
because
he
perceived
in
their
proximity
a
possible
check
upon
the
of
uncle
jim
but
he
did
not
foresee
and
no
one
could
have
foreseen
that
uncle
jim
stealing
unawares
upon
the
potwell
inn
in
the
late
afternoon
armed
with
a
large
stake
should
have
mistaken
the
bending
form
of
one
of
those
campers
who
was
pulling
a
few
onions
by
permission
in
the
garden
for
polly
and
crept
upon
it
swiftly
and
silently
and
smitten
its
wide
invitation
unforgettably
and
unforgiveably
it
was
an
error
impossible
to
explain
the
resounding
whack
went
up
to
heaven
the
cry
of
amazement
and
polly
emerged
from
the
inn
armed
with
the
he
was
cleaning
to
take
this
reckless
assailant
in
the
rear
uncle
jim
realising
his
error
fled
blaspheming
into
the
arms
of
the
other
two
campers
who
were
returning
from
the
village
with
butcher
meat
and
groceries
they
caught
him
they
smacked
his
face
with
steak
and
punched
him
with
a
bursting
parcel
of
lump
sugar
they
held
him
though
he
bit
them
and
their
idea
of
punishment
was
to
duck
him
they
were
hilarious
strong
young
stockbrokers
clerks
and
seasoned
boating
men
they
ducked
him
as
though
it
was
romping
and
all
that
polly
had
to
do
was
to
pick
up
lumps
of
sugar
for
them
and
wipe
them
on
his
sleeve
and
put
them
on
a
plate
and
explain
that
uncle
jim
was
a
notorious
bad
character
and
not
quite
right
in
his
head
got
a
regular
obsession
that
the
missis
is
his
aunt
said
polly
expanding
it
perfect
noosance
he
is
but
he
caught
a
glance
of
uncle
jim
eye
as
he
receded
before
the
campers
urgency
that
boded
ill
for
him
and
in
the
night
he
had
a
disagreeable
idea
that
perhaps
his
luck
might
not
hold
for
the
third
occasion
that
came
soon
enough
so
soon
indeed
as
the
campers
had
gone
thursday
was
the
early
closing
day
at
lammam
and
next
to
sunday
the
busiest
part
of
the
week
at
the
potwell
inn
sometimes
as
many
as
six
boats
all
at
once
would
be
moored
against
the
ferry
punt
and
hiring
rowboats
people
could
either
have
a
complete
tea
a
complete
tea
with
jam
cake
and
eggs
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
and
find
the
rest
or
refreshments
la
as
they
chose
they
sat
about
but
usually
the
boiling
had
a
delicacy
about
using
the
tables
and
grouped
themselves
humbly
on
the
ground
the
with
jam
and
eggs
got
the
best
tablecloth
on
the
table
nearest
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
door
the
groups
about
the
lawn
were
very
satisfying
to
polly
sense
of
amenity
to
the
right
were
the
with
everything
heart
could
desire
then
a
small
group
of
three
young
men
in
remarkable
green
and
violet
and
shirts
and
two
girls
in
mauve
and
yellow
blouses
with
common
teas
and
gooseberry
jam
at
the
green
clothless
table
then
on
the
grass
down
by
the
pollard
willow
a
small
family
of
hot
with
a
hamper
a
little
troubled
by
wasps
in
their
jam
from
the
nest
in
the
tree
and
all
in
mourning
but
happy
otherwise
and
on
the
lawn
to
the
right
a
ginger
beer
lot
of
without
their
collars
and
very
jocular
and
happy
the
young
people
in
the
rainbow
shirts
and
blouses
formed
the
centre
of
interest
they
were
under
the
leadership
of
a
senior
with
a
fluting
voice
and
an
air
of
mystery
he
ordered
everything
and
showed
a
peculiar
knowledge
of
the
qualities
of
the
potwell
jams
preferring
gooseberry
with
much
insistence
polly
watched
him
christened
him
the
benifluous
influence
glanced
at
the
and
went
inside
and
down
into
the
cellar
in
order
to
replenish
the
stock
of
stone
ginger
beer
which
the
plump
woman
had
allowed
to
run
low
during
the
preoccupations
of
the
campaign
it
was
in
the
cellar
that
he
first
became
aware
of
the
return
of
uncle
jim
he
became
aware
of
him
as
a
voice
a
voice
not
only
hoarse
but
thick
as
voices
thicken
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
where
that
mongrel
cried
uncle
jim
let
come
out
to
me
where
that
blighted
whisp
with
the
punt
pole
i
got
a
word
to
say
to
come
out
of
it
you
chunk
of
dirtiness
you
come
out
and
your
ugly
face
wiped
i
got
a
thing
for
you
me
that
what
doing
said
the
voice
of
uncle
jim
dropping
for
a
moment
to
sorrow
and
then
with
a
great
increment
of
wrathfulness
come
out
of
my
nest
you
blinking
cuckoo
you
or
cut
your
silly
insides
out
come
out
of
it
you
rat
stealing
another
man
away
from
come
out
and
look
me
in
the
face
you
squinting
son
of
a
skunk
polly
took
the
ginger
beer
and
went
thoughtfully
upstairs
to
the
bar
back
said
the
plump
woman
as
he
appeared
i
knew
come
back
i
heard
him
said
polly
and
looked
about
just
gim
me
the
old
poker
handle
that
under
the
beer
engine
the
door
opened
softly
and
polly
turned
quickly
but
it
was
only
the
pointed
nose
and
intelligent
face
of
the
young
man
with
the
gilt
spectacles
and
discreet
manner
he
coughed
and
the
spectacles
fixed
polly
i
say
he
said
with
quiet
earnestness
there
a
chap
out
here
seems
to
want
someone
why
do
he
come
in
said
polly
he
seems
to
want
you
out
there
what
he
want
i
said
the
spectacled
young
man
after
a
thoughtful
moment
he
appears
to
have
brought
you
a
present
of
fish
is
he
shouting
he
a
little
boisterous
he
better
come
in
the
manner
of
the
spectacled
young
man
intensified
i
wish
you
come
out
and
persuade
him
to
go
away
he
said
his
language
is
quite
the
thing
ladies
it
never
was
said
the
plump
woman
her
voice
charged
with
sorrow
polly
moved
towards
the
door
and
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
the
face
disappeared
now
my
man
came
his
voice
from
outside
be
careful
what
saying
oo
in
all
the
world
and
hereafter
are
you
to
call
me
me
man
cried
uncle
jim
in
the
voice
of
one
astonished
and
pained
beyond
endurance
and
added
scornfully
you
geezer
you
tut
tut
said
the
gentleman
in
gilt
glasses
restrain
yourself
polly
emerged
poker
in
hand
just
in
time
to
see
what
followed
uncle
jim
in
his
shirtsleeves
and
a
state
of
ferocious
decolletage
was
holding
something
yes
a
dead
eel
by
means
of
a
piece
of
newspaper
about
its
tail
holding
it
down
and
back
and
a
little
sideways
in
such
a
way
as
to
smite
with
it
upward
and
hard
it
struck
the
spectacled
gentleman
under
the
jaw
with
a
peculiar
dead
thud
and
a
cry
of
horror
came
from
the
two
seated
parties
at
the
sight
one
of
the
girls
shrieked
piercingly
horace
and
everyone
sprang
up
the
sense
of
helping
numbers
came
to
polly
aid
drop
it
he
cried
and
came
down
the
steps
waving
his
poker
and
thrusting
the
spectacled
gentleman
before
him
as
once
heroes
were
wont
to
wield
the
shield
uncle
jim
gave
ground
suddenly
and
trod
upon
the
foot
of
a
young
man
in
a
blue
shirt
who
immediately
thrust
at
him
violently
with
both
hands
lea
go
howled
uncle
jim
that
the
chap
i
looking
for
and
pressing
the
head
of
the
spectacled
gentleman
aside
smote
hard
at
polly
but
at
the
sight
of
this
indignity
inflicted
upon
the
spectacled
gentleman
a
woman
heart
was
stirred
and
a
pink
parasol
drove
hard
and
true
at
uncle
jim
wiry
neck
and
at
the
same
moment
the
young
man

lost
his

gasped
uncle
jim
with
the
ferule
at
his
throat
everywhere
and
aimed
a
second
more
successful
blow
at
polly
wup
said
polly
but
now
the
jam
and
egg
party
was
joining
in
the
fray
a
stout
yet
still
fairly
gentleman
in
white
and
black
checks
enquired
what
the
fellow
up
to
ai
there
no
police
here
and
it
was
evident
that
once
more
public
opinion
was
rallying
to
the
support
of
polly
oh
come
on
then
all
the
lot
of
you
cried
uncle
jim
and
backing
dexterously
whirled
the
eel
round
in
a
destructive
circle
the
pink
sunshade
was
torn
from
the
hand
that
gripped
it
and
whirled
athwart
the
complete
but
unadorned
tea
things
on
the
green
table
collar

someone
get
hold
of
his
collar
cried
the
gentleman
coming
out
of
the
scrimmage
retreating
up
the
steps
to
the
inn
door
as
if
to
rally
his
forces
stand
clear
you
blessed
mantel
ornaments
cried
uncle
jim
stand
clear
and
retired
backing
staving
off
attack
by
means
of
the
whirling
eel
polly
undeterred
by
a
sense
of
grave
damage
done
to
his
nose
pressed
the
attack
in
front
the
two
young
men
in
violet
and
blue
skirmished
on
uncle
jim
flanks
the
man
in
white
and
black
checks
sought
still
further
outflanking
possibilities
and
two
of
the
apprentice
boys
ran
for
oars
the
gentleman
as
if
inspired
came
down
the
wooden
steps
again
seized
the
tablecloth
of
the
jam
and
egg
party
lugged
it
from
under
the
crockery
with
inadequate
precautions
against
breakage
and
advanced
with
compressed
lips
curious
lateral
crouching
movements
swift
flashings
of
his
glasses
and
a
general
suggestion
of
in
his
pose
and
gestures
uncle
jim
was
kept
busy
and
unable
to
plan
his
retreat
with
any
strategic
soundness
he
was
moreover
manifestly
a
little
nervous
about
the
river
in
his
rear
he
gave
ground
in
a
curve
and
so
came
right
across
the
rapidly
abandoned
camp
of
the
family
in
mourning
crunching
a
teacup
under
his
heel
oversetting
the
teapot
and
finally
tripping
backwards
over
the
hamper
the
eel
flew
out
at
a
tangent
from
his
hand
and
became
a
mere
looping
relic
on
the
sward
hold
him
cried
the
gentleman
in
spectacles
collar
him
and
moving
forward
with
extraordinary
promptitude
wrapped
the
best
tablecloth
about
uncle
jim
arms
and
head
polly
grasped
his
purpose
instantly
the
man
in
checks
was
scarcely
slower
and
in
another
moment
uncle
jim
was
no
more
than
a
bundle
of
smothered
blasphemy
and
a
pair
of
wildly
active
legs
duck
him
panted
polly
holding
on
to
the
earthquake
thing
duck
him
the
bundle
was
convulsed
by
paroxysms
of
anger
and
protest
one
boot
got
the
hamper
and
sent
it
ten
yards
go
in
the
house
for
a
clothes
line
someone
said
the
gentleman
in
gold
spectacles
he
get
out
of
this
in
a
moment
one
of
the
apprentices
ran
bird
nets
in
the
garden
shouted
polly
in
the
garden
the
apprentice
was
divided
in
his
purpose
and
then
suddenly
uncle
jim
collapsed
and
became
a
limp
dead
seeming
thing
under
their
hands
his
arms
were
drawn
inward
his
legs
bent
up
under
his
person
and
so
he
lay
fainted
said
the
man
in
checks
relaxing
his
grip
a
fit
perhaps
said
the
man
in
spectacles
keep
hold
said
polly
too
late
for
suddenly
uncle
jim
arms
and
legs
flew
out
like
springs
released
polly
was
tumbled
backwards
and
fell
over
the
broken
teapot
and
into
the
arms
of
the
father
in
mourning
something
struck
his
head
dazzingly
in
another
second
uncle
jim
was
on
his
feet
and
the
tablecloth
enshrouded
the
head
of
the
man
in
checks
uncle
jim
manifestly
considered
he
had
done
all
that
honour
required
of
him
and
against
overwhelming
numbers
and
the
possibility
of
reiterated
duckings
flight
is
no
disgrace
uncle
jim
fled
polly
sat
up
after
an
interval
of
an
indeterminate
length
among
the
ruins
of
an
idyllic
afternoon
quite
a
lot
of
things
seemed
scattered
and
broken
but
it
was
difficult
to
grasp
it
all
at
once
he
stared
between
the
legs
of
people
he
became
aware
of
a
voice
speaking
slowly
and
complainingly
someone
ought
to
pay
for
those
tea
things
said
the
father
in
mourning
we
did
bring
them
to
be
danced
on
not
by
no
manner
of
means
x
there
followed
an
anxious
peace
for
three
days
and
then
a
rough
man
in
a
blue
jersey
in
the
intervals
of
trying
to
choke
himself
with
bread
and
cheese
and
pickled
onions
broke
out
abruptly
into
information
jim
lagged
again
missus
he
said
what
said
the
landlady
our
jim
your
jim
said
the
man
and
after
an
absolutely
necessary
pause
for
swallowing
added
stealin
a
he
did
not
speak
for
some
moments
and
then
he
replied
to
enquiries
yes
a
down
lammam
way
night
before
last
what
steal
a
for
asked
the
plump
woman
said
wanted
a

wonder
what
he
wanted
a
hatchet
for
said
polly
thoughtfully
i
dessay
a
use
for
it
said
the
gentleman
in
the
blue
jersey
and
he
took
a
mouthful
that
amounted
to
conversational
suicide
there
was
a
prolonged
pause
in
the
little
bar
and
polly
did
some
rapid
thinking
he
went
to
the
window
and
whistled
i
shall
stick
it
he
whispered
at
last
or
no
he
turned
to
the
man
with
the
blue
jersey
when
he
thought
him
clear
for
speech
again
how
much
did
you
say
they
given
him
he
asked
three
munce
said
the
man
in
the
blue
jersey
and
refilled
anxiously
as
if
alarmed
at
the
momentary
clearness
of
his
voice
xi
those
three
months
passed
all
too
quickly
months
of
sunshine
and
warmth
of
varied
novel
exertion
in
the
open
air
of
congenial
experiences
of
interest
and
wholesome
food
and
successful
digestion
months
that
browned
polly
and
hardened
him
and
saw
the
beginnings
of
his
beard
months
marred
only
by
one
anxiety
an
anxiety
polly
did
his
utmost
to
suppress
the
day
of
reckoning
was
never
mentioned
it
is
true
by
either
the
plump
woman
or
himself
but
the
name
of
uncle
jim
was
written
in
letters
of
glaring
silence
across
their
intercourse
as
the
term
of
that
respite
drew
to
an
end
his
anxiety
increased
until
at
last
it
even
trenched
upon
his
sleep
he
had
some
idea
of
buying
a
revolver
at
last
he
compromised
upon
a
small
and
very
foul
and
dirty
rook
rifle
which
he
purchased
in
lammam
under
a
pretext
of
bird
scaring
and
loaded
carefully
and
concealed
under
his
bed
from
the
plump
woman
eye
september
passed
away
october
came
and
at
last
came
that
night
in
october
whose
happenings
it
is
so
difficult
for
a
sympathetic
historian
to
drag
out
of
their
proper
nocturnal
indistinctness
into
the
clear
hard
light
of
positive
statement
a
novelist
should
present
characters
not
vivisect
them
publicly
the
best
the
kindliest
if
not
the
justest
course
is
surely
to
leave
untold
such
things
as
polly
would
manifestly
have
preferred
untold
polly
had
declared
that
when
the
cyclist
discovered
him
he
was
seeking
a
weapon
that
should
make
a
conclusive
end
to
uncle
jim
that
declaration
is
placed
before
the
reader
without
comment
the
gun
was
certainly
in
possession
of
uncle
jim
at
that
time
and
no
human
being
but
polly
knows
how
he
got
hold
of
it
the
cyclist
was
a
literary
man
named
warspite
who
suffered
from
insomnia
he
had
risen
and
come
out
of
his
house
near
lammam
just
before
the
dawn
and
he
discovered
polly
partially
concealed
in
the
ditch
by
the
potwell
churchyard
wall
it
is
an
ordinary
dry
ditch
full
of
nettles
and
overgrown
with
elder
and
dogrose
and
in
no
way
suggestive
of
an
arsenal
it
is
the
last
place
in
which
you
would
look
for
a
gun
and
he
says
that
when
he
dismounted
to
see
why
polly
was
allowing
only
the
latter
part
of
his
person
to
show
and
that
it
would
seem
by
inadvertency
polly
merely
raised
his
head
and
advised
him
to
look
out
and
added
he
let
fly
at
me
twice
already
he
came
out
under
persuasion
and
with
gestures
of
extreme
caution
he
was
wearing
a
white
cotton
nightgown
of
the
type
that
has
now
been
so
extensively
superseded
by
pyjama
sleeping
suits
and
his
legs
and
feet
were
bare
and
much
scratched
and
torn
and
very
muddy
warspite
takes
that
exceptionally
lively
interest
in
his
which
constitutes
so
much
of
the
distinctive
and
complex
charm
of
your
novelist
all
the
world
over
and
he
at
once
involved
himself
generously
in
the
case
the
two
men
returned
at
polly
initiative
across
the
churchyard
to
the
potwell
inn
and
came
upon
the
burst
and
damaged
rook
rifle
near
the
new
monument
to
sir
samuel
at
the
corner
by
the
yew
that
must
have
been
his
third
go
said
polly
it
sounded
a
bit
funny
the
sight
inspirited
him
greatly
and
he
explained
further
that
he
had
fled
to
the
churchyard
on
account
of
the
cover
afforded
by
tombstones
from
the
flight
of
small
shot
he
expressed
anxiety
for
the
fate
of
the
landlady
of
the
potwell
inn
and
her
grandchild
and
led
the
way
with
enhanced
alacrity
along
the
lane
to
that
establishment
they
found
the
doors
of
the
house
standing
open
the
bar
in
some
disorder
several
bottles
of
whisky
were
afterwards
found
to
be
missing
and
blake
the
village
policeman
rapping
patiently
at
the
open
door
he
entered
with
them
the
glass
in
the
bar
had
suffered
severely
and
one
of
the
mirrors
was
starred
from
a
blow
from
a
pewter
pot
the
till
had
been
forced
and
ransacked
and
so
had
the
bureau
in
the
minute
room
behind
the
bar
an
upper
window
was
opened
and
the
voice
of
the
landlady
became
audible
making
enquiries
they
went
out
and
parleyed
with
her
she
had
locked
herself
upstairs
with
the
little
girl
she
said
and
refused
to
descend
until
she
was
assured
that
neither
uncle
jim
nor
polly
gun
were
anywhere
on
the
premises
blake
and
warspite
proceeded
to
satisfy
themselves
with
regard
to
the
former
condition
and
polly
went
to
his
room
in
search
of
garments
more
suited
to
the
brightening
dawn
he
returned
immediately
with
a
request
that
blake
and
warspite
would
just
come
and
look
they
found
the
apartment
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
confusion
the
bedclothes
in
a
ball
in
the
corner
the
drawers
all
open
and
ransacked
the
chair
broken
the
lock
of
the

and
broken

panel
slightly
scorched
and
perforated
by
shot
and
the
window
wide
open
none
of
polly
clothes
were
to
be
seen
but
some
garments
which
had
apparently
once
formed
part
of
a
workaday
outfit
two
brownish
yellow
halves
of
a
shirt
and
an
unsound
pair
of
boots
were
scattered
on
the
floor
a
faint
smell
of
gunpowder
still
hung
in
the
air
and
two
or
three
books
polly
had
recently
acquired
had
been
shied
with
some
violence
under
the
bed
warspite
looked
at
blake
and
then
both
men
looked
at
polly
boots

blake
turned
his
eye
to
the
window
some
of
these
tiles

got
broken
he
observed
i

out
of
the
window
and
slid
down
the
scullery

but
uncle
jim
had
gone
altogether
he
did
not
return
for
some
days
that
perhaps
was
not
very
wonderful
but
the
days
lengthened
to
weeks
and
the
weeks
to
months
and
still
uncle
jim
did
not
recur
a
year
passed
and
the
anxiety
of
him
became
less
acute
a
second
healing
year
followed
the
first
one
afternoon
about
thirty
months
after

chapter
the
tenth
miriam
revisited
i
one
summer
afternoon
about
five
years
after
his
first
coming
to
the
potwell
inn
polly
found
himself
sitting
under
the
pollard
willow
fishing
for
dace
it
was
a
plumper
browner
and
healthier
polly
altogether
than
the
miserable
bankrupt
with
whose
dyspeptic
portrait
our
novel
opened
he
was
fat
but
with
a
fatness
more
generally
diffused
and
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
touched
to
gravity
by
a
small
square
beard
also
he
was
balder
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
found
leisure
to
fish
though
from
the
very
outset
of
his
potwell
career
he
had
promised
himself
abundant
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
fishing
fishing
as
the
golden
page
of
english
literature
testifies
is
a
meditative
and
retrospective
pursuit
and
the
varied
page
of
memory
disregarded
so
long
for
sake
of
the
teeming
duties
i
have
already
enumerated
began
to
unfold
itself
to
polly
consideration
a
speculation
about
uncle
jim
died
for
want
of
material
and
gave
place
to
a
reckoning
of
the
years
and
months
that
had
passed
since
his
coming
to
potwell
and
that
to
a
philosophical
review
of
his
life
he
began
to
think
about
miriam
remotely
and
impersonally
he
remembered
many
things
that
had
been
neglected
by
his
conscience
during
the
busier
times
as
for
example
that
he
had
committed
arson
and
deserted
a
wife
for
the
first
time
he
looked
these
long
neglected
facts
in
the
face
it
is
disagreeable
to
think
one
has
committed
arson
because
it
is
an
action
that
leads
to
jail
otherwise
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
grain
of
regret
for
that
in
polly
composition
but
deserting
miriam
was
in
a
different
category
deserting
miriam
was
mean
this
is
a
history
and
not
a
glorification
of
polly
and
i
tell
of
things
as
they
were
with
him
apart
from
the
disagreeable
twinge
arising
from
the
thought
of
what
might
happen
if
he
was
found
out
he
had
not
the
slightest
remorse
about
that
fire
arson
after
all
is
an
artificial
crime
some
crimes
are
crimes
in
themselves
would
be
crimes
without
any
law
the
cruelties
mockery
the
breaches
of
faith
that
astonish
and
wound
but
the
burning
of
things
is
in
itself
neither
good
nor
bad
a
large
number
of
houses
deserve
to
be
burnt
most
modern
furniture
an
overwhelming
majority
of
pictures
and
books
one
might
go
on
for
some
time
with
the
list
if
our
community
was
collectively
anything
more
than
a
feeble
idiot
it
would
burn
most
of
london
and
chicago
for
example
and
build
sane
and
beautiful
cities
in
the
place
of
these
pestilential
heaps
of
rotten
private
property
i
have
failed
in
presenting
polly
altogether
if
i
have
not
made
you
see
that
he
was
in
many
respects
an
artless
child
of
nature
far
more
untrained
undisciplined
and
spontaneous
than
an
ordinary
savage
and
he
was
really
glad
for
all
that
little
drawback
of
fear
that
he
had
the
courage
to
set
fire
to
his
house
and
fly
and
come
to
the
potwell
inn
but
he
was
not
glad
he
had
left
miriam
he
had
seen
miriam
cry
once
or
twice
in
his
life
and
it
had
always
reduced
him
to
abject
commiseration
he
now
imagined
her
crying
he
perceived
in
a
perplexed
way
that
he
had
made
himself
responsible
for
her
life
he
forgot
how
she
had
spoilt
his
own
he
had
hitherto
rested
in
the
faith
that
she
had
over
a
hundred
pounds
of
insurance
money
but
now
with
his
eye
meditatively
upon
his
float
he
realised
a
hundred
pounds
does
not
last
for
ever
his
conviction
of
her
incompetence
was
unflinching
she
was
bound
to
have
fooled
it
away
somehow
by
this
time
and
then
he
saw
her
humping
her
shoulders
and
sniffing
in
a
manner
he
had
always
regarded
as
detestable
at
close
quarters
but
which
now
became
harrowingly
pitiful
damn
said
polly
and
down
went
his
float
and
he
flicked
up
a
victim
to
destruction
and
took
it
off
the
hook
he
compared
his
own
comfort
and
health
with
miriam
imagined
distress
ought
to
have
done
something
for
herself
said
polly
rebaiting
his
hook
she
was
always
talking
of
doing
things
why
could
she
he
watched
the
float
oscillating
gently
towards
quiescence
silly
to
begin
thinking
about
her
he
said
damn
silly
but
once
he
had
begun
thinking
about
her
he
had
to
go
on
oh
blow
cried
polly
presently
and
pulled
up
his
hook
to
find
another
fish
had
just
snatched
at
it
in
the
last
instant
his
handling
must
have
made
the
poor
thing
feel
itself
unwelcome
he
gathered
his
things
together
and
turned
towards
the
house
all
the
potwell
inn
betrayed
his
influence
now
for
here
indeed
he
had
found
his
place
in
the
world
it
looked
brighter
so
bright
indeed
as
to
be
almost
skittish
with
the
white
and
green
paint
he
had
lavished
upon
it
even
the
garden
palings
were
striped
white
and
green
and
so
were
the
boats
for
polly
was
one
of
those
who
find
a
positive
sensuous
pleasure
in
the
laying
on
of
paint
left
and
right
were
two
large
boards
which
had
done
much
to
enhance
the
inn
popularity
with
the
variety
of
both
marked
innovations
one
bore
in
large
letters
the
single
word
museum
the
other
was
as
plain
and
laconic
with
omlets
the
spelling
of
the
latter
word
was
polly
own
but
when
he
had
seen
a
whole
boatload
of
men
intent
on
lammam
for
lunch
stop
and
stare
and
grin
and
come
in
and
ask
in
a
marked
sarcastic
manner
for
omlets
he
perceived
that
his
inaccuracy
had
done
more
for
the
place
than
his
utmost
cunning
could
have
contrived
in
a
year
or
so
the
inn
was
known
both
up
and
down
the
river
by
its
new
name
of
omlets
and
polly
after
some
secret
irritation
smiled
and
was
content
and
the
fat
woman
were
things
to
remember
you
will
note
i
have
changed
her
epithet
time
works
upon
us
all
she
stood
upon
the
steps
as
he
came
towards
the
house
and
smiled
at
him
richly
caught
many
she
asked
got
an
idea
said
polly
would
it
put
you
out
very
much
if
i
went
off
for
a
day
or
two
for
a
bit
of
a
holiday
there
wo
be
much
doing
now
until
thursday
ii
feeling
recklessly
secure
behind
his
beard
polly
surveyed
the
fishbourne
high
street
once
again
the
north
side
was
much
as
he
had
known
it
except
that
rusper
had
vanished
a
row
of
new
shops
replaced
the
destruction
of
the
great
fire
mantell
and
throbson
had
risen
again
upon
a
more
flamboyant
pattern
and
the
new
fire
station
was
in
the
style
and
with
much
red
paint
next
door
in
the
place
of
rumbold
was
a
branch
of
the
colonial
tea
company
and
then
a
salmon
and
gluckstein
tobacco
shop
and
then
a
little
shop
that
displayed
sweets
and
professed
a
tea
room
upstairs
he
considered
this
as
a
possible
place
in
which
to
prosecute
enquiries
about
his
lost
wife
wavering
a
little
between
it
and
the
god
providence
inn
down
the
street
then
his
eye
caught
a
name
over
the
window
polly
he
read
larkins
well
i
astonished
a
momentary
faintness
came
upon
him
he
walked
past
and
down
the
street
returned
and
surveyed
the
shop
again
he
saw
a
rather
untidy
woman
standing
behind
the
counter
who
for
an
instant
he
thought
might
be
miriam
terribly
changed
and
then
recognised
as
his
annie
filled
out
and
no
longer
hilarious
she
stared
at
him
without
a
sign
of
recognition
as
he
entered
the
shop
can
i
have
tea
said
polly
well
said
annie
you
but
our
tea
room

my
sister

cleaning

a
bit
upset

beg
your
pardon
said
annie
i
said
did
mind
up
here
i
daresay
there

a
table
said
annie
and
followed
him
up
to
a
room
whose
conscientious
disorder
was
intensely
reminiscent
of
miriam
nothing
like
turning
everything
upside
down
when
you
cleaning
said
polly
cheerfully
it
my
sister
way
said
annie
impartially
she
gone
out
for
a
bit
of
air
but
i
daresay
she
be
back
soon
to
finish
it
a
nice
light
room
when
it
tidy
can
i
put
you
a
table
over
there
let
said
polly
and
assisted
he
sat
down
by
the
open
window
and
drummed
on
the
table
and
meditated
on
his
next
step
while
annie
vanished
to
get
his
tea
after
all
things
did
seem
so
bad
with
miriam
he
tried
over
several
gambits
in
imagination
unusual
name
he
said
as
annie
laid
a
cloth
before
him
annie
looked
interrogation
polly
polly
larkins
real
i
suppose
polly
my
sister
name
she
married
a
mr
polly
widow
i
presume
said
polly
yes
this
five
years
come
october
lord
said
polly
in
unfeigned
surprise
found
drowned
he
was
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
place
never
heard
of
it
said
polly
i
a
stranger
rather
in
the
medway
near
maidstone
he
must
have
been
in
the
water
for
days
would
have
known
him
my
sister
would
if
it
had
been
for
the
name
sewn
in
his
clothes
all
whitey
and
eat
away
he
was
bless
my
heart
must
have
been
rather
a
shock
for
her
it
a
shock
said
annie
and
added
darkly
but
sometimes
a
shock
better
than
a
long
agony
no
doubt
said
polly
he
gazed
with
a
rapt
expression
at
the
preparations
before
him
so
i
drowned
something
was
saying
inside
him
life
insured
he
asked
we
started
the
tea
rooms
with
it
said
annie
why
if
things
were
like
this
had
remorse
and
anxiety
for
miriam
been
implanted
in
his
soul
no
shadow
of
an
answer
appeared
marriage
is
a
lottery
said
polly
found
it
so
said
annie
would
you
like
some
jam
i
like
an
egg
said
polly
i
have
two
i
got
a
sort
of
feeling
as
though
i
wanted
keeping
up
was
particularly
good
sort
this
mr
polly
he
was
a
husband
said
annie
i
often
pitied
my
sister
he
was
one
of
that
sort
dissolute
suggested
polly
faintly
no
said
annie
judiciously
not
exactly
dissolute
feeble
more
the
word
weak
was
weak
as
water
long
do
you
like
your
eggs
boiled
four
minutes
exactly
said
polly
one
gets
talking
said
annie
one
does
said
and
she
left
him
to
his
thoughts
what
perplexed
him
was
his
recent
remorse
and
tenderness
for
miriam
now
he
was
back
in
her
atmosphere
all
that
had
vanished
and
the
old
feeling
of
helpless
antagonism
returned
he
surveyed
the
piled
furniture
the
economically
managed
carpet
the
unpleasing
pictures
on
the
wall
why
had
he
felt
remorse
why
had
he
entertained
this
illusion
of
a
helpless
woman
crying
aloud
in
the
pitiless
darkness
for
him
he
peered
into
the
unfathomable
mysteries
of
the
heart
and
ducked
back
to
a
smaller
issue
he
feeble
the
eggs
came
up
nothing
in
annie
manner
invited
a
resumption
of
the
discussion
business
brisk
he
ventured
to
ask
annie
reflected
it
is
she
said
and
it
is
it
like
that
ah
said
polly
and
squared
himself
to
his
egg
was
there
an
inquest
on
that
chap
what
chap
what
was
his
name
polly
of
course
you
sure
it
was
him
what
you
mean
annie
looked
at
him
hard
and
suddenly
his
soul
was
black
with
terror
who
else
could
it
have
been
in
the
very
cloes
wore
of
course
said
polly
and
began
his
egg
he
was
so
agitated
that
he
only
realised
its
condition
when
he
was
half
way
through
it
and
annie
safely
downstairs
lord
he
said
reaching
out
hastily
for
the
pepper
one
of
miriam
management
i
have
tasted
such
an
egg
for
five
years
wonder
where
she
gets
them
picks
them
out
i
suppose
he
abandoned
it
for
its
fellow
except
for
a
slight
mustiness
the
second
egg
was
very
palatable
indeed
he
was
getting
on
to
the
bottom
of
it
as
miriam
came
in
he
looked
up
nice
afternoon
he
said
at
her
stare
and
perceived
she
knew
him
at
once
by
the
gesture
and
the
voice
she
went
white
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
she
looked
as
though
she
was
going
to
faint
polly
sprang
up
quickly
and
handed
her
a
chair
my
god
she
whispered
and
crumpled
up
rather
than
sat
down
it
she
said
no
said
polly
very
earnestly
it
is
it
just
looks
like
me
that
all
i
that
man
was
you
all
along
i
tried
to
think
it
was
i
tried
to
think
perhaps
the
water
had
altered
your
wrists
and
feet
and
the
colour
of
your
hair
ah
i
always
feared
you
come
back
polly
sat
down
by
his
egg
i
have
come
back
he
said
very
earnestly
do
you
think
it
we
pay
back
the
insurance
now
i
know
she
was
weeping
she
produced
a
handkerchief
and
covered
her
face
look
here
miriam
said
polly
i
have
come
back
and
i
not
coming
back
i
i
a
visitant
from
another
world
you
shut
up
about
me
and
i
shut
up
about
myself
i
came
back
because
i
thought
you
might
be
hard
up
or
in
trouble
or
some
silly
thing
like
that
now
i
see
you
again
i
satisfied
i
satisfied
completely
see
i
going
to
absquatulate
see
hey
presto
right
away
he
turned
to
his
tea
for
a
moment
finished
his
cup
noisily
stood
up
do
you
think
you
going
to
see
me
again
he
said
for
you
ai
he
moved
to
the
door
that
a
tasty
egg
he
said
hovered
for
a
second
and
vanished
annie
was
in
the
shop
the
missus
has
had
a
bit
of
a
shock
he
remarked
got
some
sort
of
fancy
about
a
ghost
ca
make
it
out
quite
so
long
and
he
had
gone
iii
polly
sat
beside
the
fat
woman
at
one
of
the
little
green
tables
at
the
back
of
the
potwell
inn
and
struggled
with
the
mystery
of
life
it
was
one
of
those
evenings
serenely
luminous
amply
and
atmospherically
still
when
the
river
bend
was
at
its
best
a
swan
floated
against
the
dark
green
masses
of
the
further
bank
the
stream
flowed
broad
and
shining
to
its
destiny
with
scarce
a
ripple
except
where
the
reeds
came
out
from
the
headland
the
three
poplars
rose
clear
and
harmonious
against
a
sky
of
green
and
yellow
and
it
was
as
if
it
was
all
securely
within
a
great
warm
friendly
globe
of
crystal
sky
it
was
as
safe
and
enclosed
and
fearless
as
a
child
that
has
still
to
be
born
it
was
an
evening
full
of
the
quality
of
tranquil
unqualified
assurance
polly
mind
was
filled
with
the
persuasion
that
indeed
all
things
whatsoever
must
needs
be
satisfying
and
complete
it
was
incredible
that
life
has
ever
done
more
than
seemed
to
jar
that
there
could
be
any
shadow
in
life
save
such
velvet
softnesses
as
made
the
setting
for
that
silent
swan
or
any
murmur
but
the
ripple
of
the
water
as
it
swirled
round
the
chained
and
gently
swaying
punt
and
the
mind
of
polly
exalted
and
made
tender
by
this
atmosphere
sought
gently
but
sought
to
draw
together
the
varied
memories
that
came
drifting
half
submerged
across
the
circle
of
his
mind
he
spoke
in
words
that
seemed
like
a
bent
and
broken
stick
thrust
suddenly
into
water
destroying
the
mirror
of
the
shapes
they
sought
jim
not
coming
back
again
ever
he
said
he
got
drowned
five
years
ago
where
asked
the
fat
woman
surprised
miles
from
here
in
the
medway
away
in
kent
lor
said
the
fat
woman
it
right
enough
said
polly
how
know
i
went
to
my
home
where
do
matter
i
went
and
found
out
he
been
in
the
water
some
days
he
got
my
clothes
and
they
said
it
was
me
it
do
matter
i
not
going
back
to
them
the
fat
woman
regarded
him
silently
for
some
time
her
expression
of
scrutiny
gave
way
to
a
quiet
satisfaction
then
her
brown
eyes
went
to
the
river
poor
jim
she
said
much
tact
ever
she
added
mildly
i
ca
say
i
sorry
nor
me
said
polly
and
got
a
step
nearer
the
thought
in
him
but
it
do
seem
much
good
his
having
been
alive
does
it
was
much
good
the
fat
woman
admitted
ever
i
suppose
there
were
things
that
were
good
to
him
polly
speculated
they
were
things
his
hold
slipped
again
i
often
wonder
about
life
he
said
weakly
he
tried
again
one
seems
to
start
in
life
he
said
expecting
something
and
it
does
happen
and
it
does
matter
one
starts
with
ideas
that
things
are
good
and
things
are
bad
and
it
has
much
relation
to
what
good
and
what
is
bad
i
always
been
the
skeptaceous
sort
and
it
always
seemed
rot
to
me
to
pretend
we
know
good
from
evil
it
just
what
i
done
no
adam
apple
stuck
in
throat
i
do
own
to
it
he
reflected
i
set
fire
to
a
house
once
the
fat
woman
started
i
do
feel
sorry
for
it
i
do
believe
it
was
a
bad
thing
to
do
any
more
than
burning
a
toy
like
i
did
once
when
i
was
a
baby
i
nearly
killed
myself
with
a
razor
who
has
anyhow
gone
as
far
as
thinking
of
it
most
of
my
time
i
been
half
dreaming
i
married
like
a
dream
almost
i
never
really
planned
my
life
or
set
out
to
live
i
happened
things
happened
to
me
it
so
with
everyone
jim
could
help
himself
i
shot
at
him
and
tried
to
kill
him
i
dropped
the
gun
and
he
got
it
he
very
nearly
had
me
i
was
a
second
too
soon
ducking
awkward
that
night
was
but
i
blame
him
come
to
that
only
i
do
see
what
it
all
up
to
like
children
playing
about
in
a
nursery
hurt
themselves
at
times
there
something
that
does
mind
us
he
resumed
presently
it
is
what
we
try
to
get
that
we
get
it
is
the
good
we
think
we
do
is
good
what
makes
us
happy
is
our
trying
what
makes
others
happy
is
our
trying
there
a
sort
of
character
people
like
and
stand
up
for
and
a
sort
they
wo
you
got
to
work
it
out
and
take
the
consequences
miriam
was
always
trying
who
was
miriam
asked
the
fat
woman
no
one
you
know
but
she
used
to
go
about
with
her
brows
knit
trying
not
to
do
whatever
she
wanted
to
do
if
ever
she
did
want
to
do
anything
he
lost
himself
you
ca
help
being
fat
said
the
fat
woman
after
a
pause
trying
to
get
up
to
his
thoughts
ca
said
polly
it
helps
and
it
hinders
like
my
upside
down
way
of
talking
the
magistrates
would
kept
on
the
license
to
me
if
i
been
fat
then
what
have
we
done
said
polly
to
get
an
evening
like
this
lord
look
at
it
he
sent
his
arm
round
the
great
curve
of
the
sky
if
i
was
a
nigger
or
an
italian
i
should
come
out
here
and
sing
i
whistle
sometimes
but
bless
you
it
singing
i
got
in
my
mind
sometimes
i
think
i
live
for
sunsets
i
do
see
that
it
does
you
any
good
always
looking
at
sunsets
like
you
do
said
the
fat
woman
nor
me
but
i
do
sunsets
and
things
i
was
made
to
like
they
do
you
said
the
fat
woman
thoughtfully
who
cares
said
polly
a
deeper
strain
had
come
to
the
fat
woman
you
got
to
die
some
day
she
said
some
things
i
ca
believe
said
polly
suddenly
and
one
is
your
being
a
skeleton
he
pointed
his
hand
towards
the
hedge
look
at
against
the
yellow
and
they
just
nettles
nasty
weeds
if
you
count
things
by
their
uses
and
no
help
in
the
life
hereafter
but
just
look
at
the
look
of
them
it
is
only
looks
said
the
fat
woman
whenever
there
signs
of
a
good
sunset
and
i
not
too
busy
said
polly
i
come
and
sit
out
here
the
fat
woman
looked
at
him
with
eyes
in
which
contentment
struggled
with
some
obscure
reluctant
protest
and
at
last
turned
them
slowly
to
the
black
nettle
pagodas
against
the
golden
sky
i
wish
we
could
she
said
i
will
the
fat
woman
voice
sank
nearly
to
the
inaudible
not
always
she
said
polly
was
some
time
before
he
replied
come
here
always
when
a
ghost
he
replied
spoil
the
place
for
others
said
the
fat
woman
abandoning
her
moral
solicitudes
for
a
more
congenial
point
of
view
not
my
sort
of
ghost
would
said
polly
emerging
from
another
long
pause
i
be
a
sort
of
diaphalous
feeling
just
mellowish
and
warmish
like
they
said
no
more
but
sat
on
in
the
warm
twilight
until
at
last
they
could
scarcely
distinguish
each
other
faces
they
were
not
so
much
thinking
as
lost
in
a
smooth
still
quiet
of
the
mind
a
bat
flitted
by
time
we
was
going
in
o
party
said
polly
standing
up
supper
to
get
it
as
you
say
we
ca
sit
here
for
ever
the
end
