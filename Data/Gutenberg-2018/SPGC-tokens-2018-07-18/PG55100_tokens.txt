introductory
i
am
beginning
to
write
this
book
on
board
the
brig
trading
between
kingston
in
jamaica
and
cien
fuegos
on
the
southern
coast
of
cuba
at
the
present
moment
there
is
not
a
puff
of
wind
neither
land
breeze
nor
sea
breeze
the
sails
are
flapping
idly
against
the
masts
there
is
not
motion
enough
to
give
us
the
command
of
the
rudder
the
tropical
sun
is
shining
through
upon
my
head
into
the
miserable
hole
which
they
have
deluded
me
into
thinking
was
a
cabin
the
marine
people
the
captain
and
his
satellites
are
bound
to
provide
me
and
all
that
they
have
provided
is
yams
salt
pork
biscuit
and
bad
coffee
i
should
be
starved
but
for
the
small
ham
would
that
it
had
been
a
large
one
which
i
thoughtfully
purchased
in
kingston
and
had
not
a
kind
medical
friend
as
he
grasped
me
by
the
hand
at
port
royal
stuffed
a
box
of
sardines
into
my
pocket
he
suggested
two
boxes
would
that
i
had
taken
them
it
is
now
the
january
and
if
i
do
not
reach
cien
fuegos
by
the
all
this
misery
will
have
been
in
vain
i
might
as
well
in
such
case
have
gone
to
thomas
and
spared
myself
these
experiences
of
the
merchant
navy
let
it
be
understood
by
all
men
that
in
these
latitudes
the
respectable
comfortable
route
from
every
place
to
every
other
place
is
viâ
the
little
danish
island
of
thomas
from
demerara
to
the
isthmus
of
panamá
you
go
by
thomas
from
panamá
to
jamaica
and
honduras
you
go
by
thomas
from
honduras
and
jamaica
to
cuba
and
mexico
you
go
by
thomas
from
cuba
to
the
bahamas
you
go
by
thomas
or
did
when
this
was
written
the
royal
mail
steam
packet
company
dispense
all
their
branches
from
that
favoured
spot
but
i
was
ambitious
of
a
quicker
transit
and
a
less
beaten
path
and
here
i
am
lying
under
the
lee
of
the
land
in
a
dirty
hot
motionless
tub
expiating
my
folly
we
shall
never
make
cien
fuegos
by
the
and
then
it
will
be
eight
days
more
before
i
can
reach
the
havana
may
god
forgive
me
all
my
evil
thoughts
motionless
i
said
i
wish
she
were
progressless
should
have
been
my
word
she
rolls
about
in
a
nauseous
manner
disturbing
the
two
sardines
which
i
have
economically
eaten
till
i
begin
to
fear
that
my
friend
generosity
will
become
altogether
futile
to
which
result
greatly
tends
the
stench
left
behind
it
by
the
cargo
of
salt
fish
with
which
the
brig
was
freighted
when
she
left
john
new
brunswick
for
these
ports
we
brought
but
a
very
small
quantity
the
skipper
says
if
so
that
very
small
quantity
was
stowed
above
and
below
the
very
bunk
which
has
been
given
up
to
me
as
a
ugh
we
are
very
poor
said
the
skipper
when
he
got
me
on
board
well
poverty
is
no
disgrace
said
i
as
one
does
when
cheering
a
poor
man
we
are
very
poor
indeed
i
can
not
even
offer
you
a
cigar
my
was
immediately
out
of
my
pocket
after
all
cigars
are
but
as
coals
going
to
newcastle
when
one
intends
to
be
in
cuba
in
four
days
we
are
very
poor
indeed
sir
said
the
skipper
again
when
i
brought
out
my
solitary
bottle
of
brandy
for
i
must
acknowledge
to
a
bottle
of
brandy
as
well
as
to
the
small
ham
we
have
not
a
drop
of
spirits
of
any
kind
on
board
then
i
altered
my
mind
and
began
to
feel
that
poverty
was
a
disgrace
what
business
had
this
man
to
lure
me
into
his
stinking
boat
telling
me
that
he
would
take
me
to
cien
fuegos
and
feed
me
on
the
way
when
he
had
not
a
mouthful
to
eat
or
a
drop
to
drink
and
could
not
raise
a
puff
of
wind
to
fill
his
sails
sir
said
i
brandy
is
dangerous
in
these
latitudes
unless
it
be
taken
medicinally
as
for
myself
i
take
no
other
kind
of
physic
i
think
that
poverty
on
shipboard
is
a
disgrace
and
should
not
be
encouraged
should
i
ever
be
on
shore
again
my
views
may
become
more
charitable
oh
for
the
good
ship
which
i
used
to
abuse
with
such
objurgations
because
the
steward
did
not
come
at
my
very
first
call
because
the
claret
was
only
half
iced
because
we
were
forced
to
close
our
little
whist
at
the
at
that
hour
inexorably
extinguishing
all
the
lights
how
rancorous
were
our
tongues
this
comes
of
monopoly
said
a
stern
and
eloquent
neighbour
at
the
holding
up
to
sight
a
somewhat
withered
apple
and
dis
said
a
grinning
frenchman
from
martinique
with
a
curse
exhibiting
a
rotten
walnut
dis
dis
they
give
me
dis
for
my
moneys
for
my
pounds
and
glancing
round
with
angry
eye
he
dropped
the
walnut
on
to
his
plate
apples
and
walnuts
what
would
i
give
for
the
now
for
my
berth
then
thought
so
small
for
its
awning
for
a
bottle
of
its
soda
water
for
one
cut
from
one
of
all
its
legs
of
mutton
for
two
hours
of
its
steam
movement
and
yet
it
is
only
now
that
i
am
learning
to
forgive
that
withered
apple
and
that
claret
having
said
so
much
about
my
present
position
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
allowed
to
say
a
few
words
about
my
present
person
there
now
exists
an
opportunity
for
doing
so
as
i
have
before
me
the
spanish
passport
for
which
i
paid
sixteen
shillings
in
kingston
the
day
before
i
left
it
it
is
simply
signed
pedro
badan
but
it
is
headed
don
pedro
badan
calderon
de
la
barca
which
sounds
to
me
very
much
as
though
i
were
to
call
myself
anthony
trollope
ben
jonson
to
this
will
be
answered
that
such
might
have
been
my
name
but
then
i
should
not
have
signed
myself
anthony
trollope
the
gentleman
however
has
doubtless
been
right
according
to
his
spanish
lights
and
the
name
sounds
very
grand
especially
as
there
is
added
to
it
two
lines
declaring
how
that
don
pedro
badan
is
a
caballero
he
was
as
dignified
a
personage
as
a
spanish
don
should
be
and
seemed
somewhat
particular
about
the
sixteen
shillings
as
spanish
and
other
dons
generally
are
he
has
informed
me
as
to
my
talla
that
it
is
alta
i
rather
like
the
old
man
on
the
whole
never
before
this
have
i
obtained
in
a
passport
any
more
dignified
description
of
my
body
than
robust
i
certainly
like
the
word
alta
then
my
eyes
are
azure
this
he
did
not
find
out
by
the
unassisted
guidance
of
personal
inspection
ojos
blue
he
suggested
to
me
trying
to
look
through
my
spectacles
not
understanding
ojos
i
said
yes
my
cejas
are
castañas
and
so
is
my
cabello
also
castañas
must
be
chestnut
surely
cejas
may
mean
eyebrows
cabello
is
certainly
hair
now
any
but
a
spaniard
would
have
declared
that
as
to
hair
i
was
bald
and
as
to
eyebrows
nothing
in
particular
my
colour
is
sano
there
is
great
comfort
in
that
i
like
the
word
sano
mens
sana
in
corpore
sano
what
has
a
man
to
wish
for
but
that
i
thank
thee
once
more
don
pedro
badan
calderon
de
la
barca
but
then
comes
the
mystery
if
i
have
any
personal
vanity
it
is
wrapped
up
in
my
beard
it
is
a
fine
manly
article
of
dandyism
that
wears
well
in
all
climates
and
does
not
cost
much
even
when
new
well
what
has
the
don
said
of
my
beard
it
is
poblada
i
would
give
five
shillings
for
the
loan
of
a
spanish
dictionary
at
this
moment
poblada
well
my
first
effort
if
ever
i
do
reach
cuba
shall
be
made
with
reference
to
that
word
oh
we
are
getting
into
the
are
we
let
æolus
be
thanked
at
last
i
should
be
glad
to
get
into
a
monsoon
or
a
simoom
at
the
present
moment
if
there
be
monsoons
and
simooms
in
these
parts
yes
it
comes
rippling
down
upon
us
with
a
sweet
cool
airy
breeze
the
sails
flap
rather
more
loudly
as
though
they
had
some
life
in
them
and
then
fill
themselves
with
a
grateful
motion
our
three
or
four
sailors
rise
from
the
deck
where
they
have
been
snoring
and
begin
to
stretch
themselves
you
may
put
her
about
says
the
skipper
for
be
it
known
that
for
some
hours
past
her
head
has
been
lying
back
towards
port
royal
we
shall
make
fine
track
now
sir
he
says
turning
to
me
and
be
at
cien
fuegos
on
the
i
demanded
perhaps
sir
perhaps
we
lost
hours
sir
doing
nothing
you
know
oh
wretched
man
that
i
am
the
conveyance
from
cien
fuegos
to
the
havana
is
but
once
a
week
the
sails
are
still
flopping
against
the
yard
it
is
now
noon
on
the
of
january
and
neither
captain
mate
crew
nor
the
one
solitary
passenger
have
the
least
idea
when
the
good
brig
will
reach
the
port
of
cien
fuegos
not
even
whether
she
will
reach
it
at
all
since
that
time
we
have
had
wind
enough
in
all
conscience
lovely
breezes
as
the
mate
called
them
but
we
have
oversailed
our
mark
and
by
how
much
no
man
on
board
this
vessel
can
tell
neither
the
captain
nor
the
mate
were
ever
in
cien
fuegos
before
and
i
begin
to
doubt
whether
they
ever
will
be
there
no
one
knows
where
we
are
an
old
stove
has
it
seems
been
stowed
away
right
under
the
compass
giving
a
false
bias
to
the
needle
so
that
our
only
guide
guides
us
wrong
there
is
not
a
telescope
on
board
i
very
much
doubt
the
skipper
power
of
taking
an
observation
though
he
certainly
goes
through
the
form
of
holding
a
machine
like
a
brazen
spider
up
to
his
eye
about
midday
my
brandy
and
cigars
are
done
and
altogether
we
are
none
of
us
jolly
flap
flap
flap
roll
roll
roll
the
time
passes
in
this
way
very
tediously
and
then
there
has
come
upon
us
all
a
feeling
not
expressed
though
seen
in
the
face
of
all
of
utter
want
of
confidence
in
our
master
there
is
none
of
the
excitement
of
danger
for
the
land
is
within
a
mile
of
us
none
of
the
exhaustion
of
work
for
there
is
nothing
to
do
of
pork
and
biscuits
and
water
there
is
i
believe
plenty
there
is
nothing
tragic
to
be
made
out
of
it
but
comic
misery
wears
one
quite
as
deeply
as
that
of
a
sterner
sort
it
is
hardly
credible
that
men
should
be
sent
about
a
job
for
which
they
are
so
little
capable
and
as
to
which
want
of
experience
must
be
so
expensive
here
we
are
beating
up
the
coast
of
cuba
against
the
prevailing
wind
knowing
nothing
of
the
points
which
should
guide
us
and
looking
out
for
a
harbour
without
a
to
assist
our
eyes
when
we
reach
port
be
it
cien
fuegos
or
any
other
the
first
thing
we
must
do
will
be
to
ask
the
name
of
it
it
is
incredible
to
myself
that
i
should
have
found
my
way
into
such
circumstances
i
have
been
unable
not
to
recount
my
present
immediate
troubles
they
press
with
such
weight
upon
my
spirits
but
i
have
yet
to
commence
my
journeyings
at
their
beginning
hitherto
i
have
but
told
under
what
circumstances
i
began
the
actual
work
of
writing
on
the
of
november
i
left
the
port
of
southampton
in
the
good
ship
my
purposed
business
o
cherished
reader
was
not
that
of
writing
these
pages
for
thy
delectation
but
the
accomplishment
of
certain
affairs
of
state
of
import
grave
or
trifling
as
the
case
may
be
with
which
neither
thou
nor
i
shall
have
further
concern
in
these
pages
so
much
it
may
be
well
that
i
should
say
in
order
that
my
apparently
purposeless
wanderings
may
be
understood
to
have
had
some
method
in
them
and
in
the
good
ship
i
reached
that
emporium
of
travellers
thomas
on
the
of
december
we
had
awfully
bad
weather
of
course
and
the
ship
did
wonders
when
men
write
their
travels
the
weather
has
always
been
bad
and
the
ship
has
always
done
wonders
we
thought
ourselves
very
uncomfortable
i
for
one
now
know
better
and
abused
the
company
and
the
captain
and
the
purser
and
the
purveyor
and
the
stewards
every
day
at
breakfast
and
dinner
not
always
with
the
eloquence
of
the
frenchman
and
his
walnut
but
very
frequently
with
quite
equal
energy
but
at
the
end
of
our
journey
we
were
all
smiles
and
so
was
the
captain
he
was
tender
to
the
ladies
and
cordial
to
the
gentlemen
and
we
each
in
our
kind
reciprocated
his
attention
on
the
whole
o
my
readers
if
you
are
going
to
the
west
indies
you
may
do
worse
than
go
in
the
but
do
not
think
too
much
of
your
withered
apples
i
landed
at
thomas
where
we
lay
for
some
hours
and
as
i
put
my
foot
on
the
tropical
soil
for
the
first
time
a
lady
handed
me
a
rose
saying
that
for
love
dear
i
took
it
and
said
that
it
should
be
for
love
she
was
beautifully
nay
elegantly
dressed
her
hat
was
as
graceful
as
are
those
of
ryde
or
brighton
the
skirts
of
her
muslin
dress
gave
to
her
upright
figure
that
look
of
easily
compressible
bulk
which
let
do
what
it
will
has
become
so
sightly
to
our
eyes
pink
gloves
were
on
her
hands
that
for
love
dear
yes
it
shall
be
for
love
for
thee
and
thine
if
i
can
find
that
thou
deservest
it
what
was
it
to
me
that
she
was
as
black
as
my
boot
or
that
she
had
come
to
look
after
the
ship
washing
i
shall
probably
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
thomas
but
not
now
it
is
a
place
in
which
perhaps
the
element
declaring
itself
in
nasal
twang
and
sherry
cobblers
seems
to
be
of
the
strongest
flavour
as
undoubtedly
will
be
the
case
in
many
of
these
parts
as
years
go
on
revolving
that
nasal
twang
will
sound
as
the
bocca
romana
in
coming
fashionable
western
circles
those
sherry
cobblers
will
be
the
falernian
drink
of
a
people
masters
of
half
the
world
i
dined
at
the
hotel
but
should
have
got
a
better
dinner
on
board
the
in
spite
of
the
withered
apples
from
thomas
we
went
to
kingston
jamaica
in
the
we
were
now
separated
from
the
large
host
of
spaniards
who
had
come
with
us
going
to
peru
the
spanish
main
mexico
cuba
or
porto
rico
and
to
tell
the
truth
we
were
not
on
the
occasion
spaniards
are
bad
the
spaniard
at
least
of
the
western
hemisphere
they
seize
the
meats
upon
the
table
somewhat
greedily
their
ablutions
are
not
plentiful
and
their
timidity
makes
them
cumbersome
that
they
are
very
lions
when
facing
an
enemy
on
terra
firma
i
do
not
doubt
history
i
believe
tells
so
much
for
them
but
half
a
gale
of
wind
lays
them
prostrate
at
all
hours
except
we
had
no
spaniards
in
the
but
a
happy
jovial
little
crew
of
englishmen
and
englishwomen
or
of
english
subjects
rather
for
the
majority
of
them
belonged
to
jamaica
the
bad
weather
was
at
an
end
and
all
our
nautical
troubles
nearly
over
so
we
ate
and
drank
and
smoked
and
danced
and
swore
mutual
friendship
till
the
officer
of
the
board
of
health
visited
us
as
we
rounded
the
point
at
port
royal
and
again
ruffled
our
tempers
by
delaying
us
for
some
thirty
minutes
under
a
broiling
sun
kingston
harbour
is
a
large
lagune
formed
by
a
long
narrow
bank
of
sand
which
runs
out
into
the
sea
commencing
some
three
or
four
miles
above
the
town
of
kingston
and
continuing
parallel
with
the
coast
on
which
kingston
is
built
till
it
reaches
a
point
some
five
or
six
miles
below
kingston
this
sandbank
is
called
the
palisades
and
the
point
or
end
of
it
is
port
royal
this
is
the
seat
of
naval
supremacy
for
jamaica
and
as
far
as
england
is
concerned
for
the
surrounding
islands
and
territories
and
here
lies
our
and
here
we
maintain
a
commodore
a
a
naval
hospital
a
pile
of
invalided
anchors
and
all
the
usual
adjuncts
of
such
an
establishment
some
years
ago
i
am
not
good
at
dates
but
say
seventy
if
you
will
port
royal
was
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
those
who
are
geographically
inclined
should
be
made
to
understand
that
the
communication
between
port
royal
and
kingston
as
indeed
between
port
royal
and
any
other
part
of
the
island
is
by
water
it
is
i
believe
on
record
that
hardy
subs
and
hardier
mids
have
ridden
along
the
palisades
and
not
died
from
in
the
effort
but
the
chances
are
much
against
them
the
ordinary
ingress
and
egress
is
by
water
the
ferry
boats
usually
take
about
an
hour
and
the
charge
is
a
shilling
the
writer
of
these
pages
however
has
been
two
hours
and
a
quarter
in
the

chapter
ii
jamaica
town
were
it
arranged
by
fate
that
my
future
residence
should
be
in
jamaica
i
should
certainly
prefer
the
life
of
a
country
mouse
the
town
mice
in
my
mind
have
but
a
bad
time
of
it
of
all
towns
that
i
ever
saw
kingston
is
perhaps
on
the
whole
the
least
alluring
and
is
the
more
absolutely
without
any
point
of
attraction
for
the
stranger
than
any
other
it
is
built
down
close
to
the
sea
or
rather
on
the
lagune
which
forms
the
harbour
has
a
southern
aspect
and
is
hot
even
in
winter
i
have
seen
the
thermometer
considerably
above
eighty
in
the
shade
in
december
and
the
mornings
are
peculiarly
hot
so
that
there
is
no
time
at
which
exercise
can
be
taken
with
comfort
at
about
a
sea
breeze
springs
up
which
makes
it
somewhat
cooler
than
it
is
two
hours
earlier
that
is
cooler
in
the
houses
the
sea
breeze
however
is
not
of
a
nature
to
soften
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
to
make
it
even
safe
to
walk
far
at
that
hour
then
in
the
evening
there
is
no
twilight
and
when
the
sun
is
down
it
is
dark
the
stranger
will
not
find
it
agreeable
to
walk
much
about
kingston
in
the
dark
indeed
the
residents
in
the
town
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
never
walk
men
even
young
men
whose
homes
are
some
mile
or
distant
from
their
offices
ride
or
drive
to
their
work
as
systematically
as
a
man
who
lives
at
watford
takes
the
railway
kingston
on
a
map
for
there
is
a
map
even
of
kingston
looks
admirably
well
the
streets
all
run
in
parallels
there
is
a
fine
large
square
plenty
of
public
buildings
and
almost
a
plethora
of
places
of
worship
everything
is
named
with
propriety
and
there
could
be
no
nicer
town
anywhere
but
this
word
of
promise
to
the
ear
is
strangely
broken
when
the
performance
is
brought
to
the
test
more
than
half
the
streets
are
not
filled
with
houses
those
which
are
so
filled
and
those
which
are
not
have
an
equally
rugged
disreputable
and
bankrupt
appearance
the
houses
are
mostly
of
wood
and
are
unpainted
disjointed
and
going
to
ruin
those
which
are
built
with
brick
not
unfrequently
appear
as
though
the
mortar
had
been
diligently
picked
out
from
the
interstices
but
the
disgrace
of
jamaica
is
the
causeway
of
the
streets
themselves
there
never
was
so
odious
a
place
in
which
to
move
there
is
no
pathway
or
trottoir
to
the
streets
though
there
is
very
generally
some
such
i
can
not
call
it
accommodation
before
each
individual
house
but
as
these
are
all
broken
from
each
other
by
steps
up
and
down
as
they
are
of
different
levels
and
sometimes
terminate
abruptly
without
any
steps
they
can
not
be
used
by
the
public
one
is
driven
therefore
into
the
middle
of
the
street
but
the
street
is
neither
paved
nor
macadamized
nor
prepared
for
traffic
in
any
way
in
dry
weather
it
is
a
bed
of
sand
and
in
wet
weather
it
is
a
watercourse
down
the
middle
of
this
the
unfortunate
pedestrian
has
to
wade
with
a
tropical
sun
on
his
head
and
this
he
must
do
in
a
town
which
from
its
position
is
hotter
than
almost
any
other
in
the
west
indies
it
is
no
wonder
that
there
should
be
but
little
walking
but
the
stranger
does
not
find
himself
naturally
in
possession
of
a
horse
and
carriage
he
may
have
a
for
eight
shillings
but
that
is
expensive
as
well
as
dilatory
if
he
merely
wishes
to
call
at
the
or
buy
a
pair
of
gloves
there
are
articles
which
they
call
omnibuses
and
which
ply
cheap
enough
and
carry
men
to
any
part
of
the
town
for
sixpence
that
is
they
will
do
so
if
you
can
find
them
they
do
not
run
from
any
given
point
to
any
other
but
meander
about
through
the
slush
and
sand
and
are
as
difficult
to
catch
as
the
musquitoes
the
city
of
havana
in
cuba
is
lighted
at
night
by
the
little
town
of
cien
fuegos
in
the
same
island
is
lighted
by
gas
but
kingston
is
not
lighted
at
all
we
all
know
that
jamaica
is
not
thriving
as
once
it
throve
and
that
one
can
hardly
expect
to
find
there
all
the
energy
of
a
prosperous
people
but
still
i
think
that
something
might
be
done
to
redeem
this
town
from
its
utter
disgrace
kingston
itself
is
not
without
wealth
if
what
one
hears
on
such
subjects
contains
any
indications
towards
the
truth
those
in
trade
there
are
still
doing
well
there
is
a
mayor
and
there
are
aldermen
all
the
paraphernalia
for
carrying
on
municipal
improvements
are
ready
if
the
inhabitants
have
about
themselves
any
pride
in
their
locality
let
them
in
the
name
of
common
decency
prepare
some
sort
of
causeway
in
the
streets
with
some
drainage
arrangement
by
which
rain
may
run
off
into
the
sea
without
lingering
for
hours
in
every
corner
of
the
town
nothing
could
be
easier
for
there
is
a
fall
towards
the
shore
through
the
whole
place
as
it
is
now
kingston
is
a
disgrace
to
the
country
that
owns
it
one
is
peculiarly
struck
also
by
the
ugliness
of
the
buildings
those
buildings
that
is
which
partake
in
any
degree
of
a
public
character
the
churches
and
places
of
worship
the
public
offices
and
such
like
we
have
no
right
perhaps
to
expect
good
taste
so
far
away
from
any
school
in
which
good
taste
is
taught
and
it
may
perhaps
be
said
by
some
that
we
have
sins
enough
of
our
own
at
home
to
induce
us
to
be
silent
on
this
head
but
it
is
singular
that
any
man
who
could
put
bricks
and
stones
and
timber
together
should
put
them
together
in
such
hideous
forms
as
those
which
are
to
be
seen
here
i
never
met
a
wider
and
a
kinder
hospitality
than
i
did
in
jamaica
but
i
neither
ate
nor
drank
in
any
house
in
kingston
except
my
hotel
nor
as
far
as
i
can
remember
did
i
enter
any
house
except
in
the
way
of
business
and
yet
i
was
there
necessarily
there
unfortunately
for
some
considerable
time
the
fact
is
that
hardly
any
europeans
or
even
white
creoles
live
in
the
town
they
have
country
seats
pens
as
they
call
them
at
some
little
distance
they
hate
the
town
and
it
is
no
wonder
they
should
do
so
that
which
tends
in
part
to
the
desolation
of
kingston
or
rather
to
put
the
proposition
in
a
juster
form
which
prevents
kingston
from
enjoying
those
advantages
which
would
naturally
attach
to
the
metropolis
of
the
island
is
this
the
seat
of
government
is
not
there
but
at
spanish
town
then
our
naval
establishment
is
at
port
royal
when
a
city
is
in
itself
thriving
populous
and
of
great
commercial
importance
it
may
be
very
well
to
make
it
wholly
independent
of
the
government
new
york
probably
might
be
no
whit
improved
were
the
national
congress
to
be
held
there
nor
amsterdam
perhaps
if
the
hague
were
abandoned
but
it
would
be
a
great
thing
for
kingston
if
spanish
town
were
deserted
the
governor
lives
at
the
latter
place
as
do
also
those
satellites
or
moons
who
revolve
round
the
larger
luminary
the
secretaries
namely
and
executive
officers
these
in
jamaica
are
now
so
reduced
in
size
that
they
could
not
perhaps
do
much
for
any
city
but
they
would
do
a
little
and
to
kingston
any
little
would
be
acceptable
then
the
legislative
council
and
the
house
of
assembly
sit
at
spanish
town
and
the
members
at
any
rate
of
the
latter
body
are
obliged
to
live
there
during
some
three
months
of
the
year
not
generally
in
very
comfortable
lodgings
respectable
residents
in
the
island
who
would
pay
some
attention
to
the
governor
if
he
lived
at
the
principal
town
find
it
impossible
to
undergo
the
nuisance
of
visiting
spanish
town
and
in
this
way
go
neither
to
the
one
nor
the
other
unless
when
passing
through
kingston
on
their
biennial
or
triennial
visits
to
the
old
country
and
those
visits
to
spanish
town
are
indeed
a
nuisance
in
saying
this
i
reflect
in
no
way
on
the
governor
or
the
governor
people
were
gabriel
governor
of
jamaica
with
only
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
had
he
a
dozen
angels
with
him
as
secretaries
and
mortal
men
would
not
go
to
them
at
spanish
town
after
they
had
once
seen
of
what
feathers
their
wings
were
made
it
is
like
the
city
of
the
dead
there
are
long
streets
there
in
which
no
human
inhabitant
is
ever
seen
in
others
a
silent
old
negro
woman
may
be
sitting
at
an
open
door
or
a
child
playing
solitary
in
the
dust
the
governor
house
king
house
as
it
is
called
stands
on
one
side
of
a
square
opposite
is
the
house
of
the
assembly
on
the
left
as
you
come
out
from
the
governor
are
the
executive
offices
and
house
of
the
council
and
on
the
right
some
other
public
buildings
the
place
would
have
some
pretension
about
it
did
it
not
seem
to
be
stricken
with
an
eternal
death
all
the
walls
are
of
a
dismal
dirty
yellow
and
a
stranger
can
not
but
think
that
the
colour
is
owing
to
the
dreadfully
prevailing
disease
of
the
country
in
this
square
there
are
no
sounds
men
and
women
never
frequent
it
nothing
enters
it
but
sunbeams
and
such
sunbeams
the
glare
from
those
walls
seems
to
forbid
that
men
and
women
should
come
there
the
parched
dusty
deserted
streets
are
all
hot
and
perfectly
without
shade
the
crafty
italians
have
built
their
narrow
streets
so
that
the
sun
can
hardly
enter
them
except
when
he
is
in
the
mid
heaven
but
there
has
been
no
such
craft
at
spanish
town
the
houses
are
very
low
and
when
there
is
any
sun
in
the
heavens
it
can
enter
those
streets
and
in
those
heavens
there
is
always
a
burning
broiling
sun
but
the
place
is
not
wholly
deserted
there
is
here
the
most
frightfully
hideous
race
of
pigs
that
ever
made
a
man
ashamed
to
own
himself
a
biped
i
have
never
done
much
in
pigs
myself
but
i
believe
that
pigly
grace
consists
in
plumpness
and
comparative
shortness
in
shortness
above
all
of
the
face
and
nose
the
spanish
town
pigs
are
never
plump
they
are
the
very
ghosts
of
swine
consisting
entirely
of
bones
and
bristles
their
backs
are
long
their
ribs
are
long
their
legs
are
long
but
above
all
their
heads
and
noses
are
hideously
long
these
brutes
prowl
about
in
the
sun
and
glare
at
the
unfrequent
strangers
with
their
starved
eyes
as
though
doubting
themselves
whether
by
some
little
exertion
they
might
not
become
beasts
of
prey
the
necessity
which
exists
for
white
men
going
to
spanish
town
to
see
the
governor
results
i
do
not
doubt
in
some
deaths
every
year
i
will
describe
the
first
time
i
was
thus
punished
spanish
town
is
thirteen
miles
from
kingston
and
the
journey
is
accomplished
by
railway
in
somewhat
under
an
hour
the
trains
run
about
every
four
hours
on
my
arrival
a
public
vehicle
took
me
from
the
station
up
to
king
house
and
everything
seemed
to
be
very
convenient
the
streets
certainly
were
rather
dead
and
the
place
hot
but
i
was
under
cover
and
the
desolation
did
not
seem
to
affect
me
when
i
was
landed
on
the
steps
of
the
the
first
idea
of
my
coming
sorrows
flitted
across
my
mind
where
shall
i
call
for
you
said
the
driver
the
train
goes
at
a
quarter
past
four
it
was
then
one
and
where
was
he
to
call
for
me
and
what
was
i
to
do
with
myself
for
three
hours
here
i
said
on
these
steps
what
other
place
could
i
name
i
knew
no
other
place
in
spanish
town
the
governor
was
all
that
was
obliging
as
governors
always
are
and
made
an
appointment
for
me
to
come
again
on
the
following
day
to
see
some
one
or
say
something
who
or
which
could
not
be
seen
or
said
on
that
occasion
thus
some
twenty
minutes
were
exhausted
and
there
remained
two
hours
and
fifty
minutes
more
upon
my
hands
how
i
wished
that
the
big
man
big
men
had
not
been
so
rapidly
courteous
that
they
had
kept
me
waiting
for
some
hour
or
so
to
teach
me
that
i
was
among
big
people
as
used
to
be
done
in
the
good
old
times
in
such
event
i
should
at
any
rate
have
had
a
seat
though
a
hard
one
and
shelter
from
the
sun
but
not
a
moment
grace
had
been
afforded
me
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
i
found
myself
again
standing
on
those
glaring
steps
what
should
i
do
where
should
i
go
looking
all
around
me
i
did
not
see
as
much
life
as
would
serve
to
open
a
door
if
i
asked
for
shelter
i
stood
upon
those
desolate
steps
till
the
perspiration
ran
down
my
face
with
the
labour
of
standing
where
was
i
to
go
what
was
i
to
do
inhospitalem
caucasum
i
exclaimed
as
i
slowly
made
my
way
down
into
the
square
when
an
englishman
has
nothing
to
do
and
a
certain
time
to
wait
his
one
resource
is
to
walk
about
a
frenchman
sits
down
and
lights
a
cigar
an
italian
goes
to
sleep
a
german
meditates
an
american
invents
some
new
position
for
his
limbs
as
far
as
possible
asunder
from
that
intended
for
them
by
nature
but
an
englishman
always
takes
a
walk
i
had
nothing
to
do
even
under
the
full
fury
of
the
sun
walking
is
better
than
standing
still
i
would
take
a
walk
i
moved
slowly
round
the
square
and
by
the
time
that
i
had
reached
an
opposite
corner
all
my
clothes
were
wet
through
on
i
went
however
down
one
dead
street
and
up
another
i
saw
no
one
but
the
pigs
and
almost
envied
them
their
fleshlessness
i
turned
another
corner
and
i
came
upon
the
square
again
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
lowest
depth
of
all
that
fiery
pandemonium
and
with
a
quickened
step
i
passed
through
but
a
corner
of
it
but
the
sun
blazed
even
fiercer
and
fiercer
should
i
go
back
and
ask
for
a
seat
if
it
were
but
on
a
bench
in
the
government
scullery
among
the
female
negroes
something
i
must
do
or
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
me
there
must
be
some
inn
in
the
place
if
i
could
only
find
it
i
was
not
absolutely
in
the
midst
of
the
great
sahara
there
were
houses
on
each
side
of
me
though
they
were
all
closed
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
found
that
ten
minutes
had
passed
by
since
i
had
been
on
my
legs
i
thought
i
had
wandered
for
an
hour
and
now
i
saw
an
old
woman
the
first
human
creature
i
had
seen
since
i
left
the
light
of
the
governor
face
the
shade
i
should
say
meaning
to
speak
of
it
in
the
most
complimentary
terms
madam
said
i
is
there
an
inn
here
and
if
so
where
may
it
be
inn
repeated
the
ancient
negress
looking
at
me
in
a
startled
way
me
know
noting
massa
and
so
she
passed
on
inns
in
jamaica
are
called
or
else
taverns
but
i
did
not
find
this
out
till
afterwards
and
then
i
saw
a
man
walking
quickly
with
a
basket
across
the
street
some
way
in
advance
of
me
if
i
did
not
run
i
should
miss
him
so
i
did
run
and
i
hallooed
also
i
shall
never
forget
the
exertion
is
there
a
i
exclaimed
feverishly
in
this
place
i
forget
the
exact
word
which
should
fill
up
the
blank
but
i
think
it
was
blessed
massa
in
dis
d
m
place
said
the
grinning
negro
repeating
my
words
after
me
only
that
i
know
used
the
offensive
phrase
which
i
have
designated
what
dat
and
then
he
adjusted
his
basket
on
his
head
and
proceeded
to
walk
on
by
this
time
i
was
half
blind
and
my
head
reeled
through
the
effects
of
the
sun
but
i
could
not
allow
myself
to
perish
there
in
the
middle
of
spanish
town
without
an
effort
it
behoved
me
as
a
man
to
do
something
to
save
my
life
so
i
stopped
the
fellow
and
at
last
succeeded
in
making
him
understand
that
i
would
give
him
sixpence
if
he
would
conduct
me
to
some
house
of
public
entertainment
oh
de
vellington
tavern
said
he
and
taking
me
to
a
corner
three
yards
from
where
we
stood
he
showed
me
the
and
now
de
two
quatties
he
said
i
knew
nothing
of
quatties
then
but
i
gave
him
the
sixpence
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
found
myself
within
the
wellington
it
was
a
miserable
hole
but
it
did
afford
me
shelter
indeed
it
would
not
have
been
so
miserable
had
i
known
at
first
as
i
did
some
few
minutes
before
i
left
that
there
was
a
better
room
up
stairs
but
the
people
of
the
house
could
not
suppose
but
what
every
one
knew
the
wellington
and
thought
doubtless
that
i
preferred
remaining
below
in
the
dirt
i
was
over
two
hours
in
this
place
and
even
that
was
not
pleasant
when
i
went
up
into
the
fashionable
room
above
i
found
there
among
others
a
negro
of
exceeding
blackness
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
saw
skin
so
purely
black
he
was
talking
eagerly
with
his
friends
and
after
a
while
i
heard
him
say
in
a
voice
of
considerable
dignity
i
shall
bring
forward
a
motion
on
de
subject
in
de
house
so
that
i
had
not
fallen
into
bad
society
but
even
under
these
circumstances
two
hours
spent
in
a
tavern
without
a
book
without
any
necessity
for
eating
or
drinking
is
not
pleasant
and
i
trust
that
when
i
next
visit
jamaica
i
may
find
the
seat
of
government
moved
to
kingston
the
governor
would
do
kingston
some
good
and
it
is
on
the
cards
that
kingston
might
return
the
compliment
the
inns
in
kingston
rejoice
in
the
grand
name
of
halls
not
that
you
ask
which
is
the
best
hall
or
inquire
at
what
hall
your
friend
is
staying
but
such
is
the
title
given
to
the
individual
house
one
is
the
hall
another
blundle
hall
a
third
barkly
hall
and
so
on
i
took
up
my
abode
at
blundle
hall
and
found
that
the
landlady
in
whose
custody
i
had
placed
myself
was
a
sister
of
good
seacole
my
sister
wanted
to
go
to
india
said
my
landlady
with
the
army
you
know
but
queen
victoria
would
not
let
her
her
life
was
too
precious
so
that
seacole
is
a
prophet
even
in
her
own
country
much
can
not
be
said
for
the
west
indian
hotels
in
general
by
far
the
best
that
i
met
was
at
cien
fuegos
in
cuba
this
one
kept
by
seacole
sister
was
not
worse
if
not
much
better
than
the
average
it
was
clean
and
reasonable
as
to
its
charges
i
used
to
wish
that
the
patriotic
lady
who
kept
it
could
be
induced
to
abandon
the
idea
that
beefsteaks
and
onions
and
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
composed
the
only
diet
proper
for
an
englishman
but
it
is
to
be
remarked
all
through
the
island
that
the
people
are
fond
of
english
dishes
and
that
they
despise
or
affect
to
despise
their
own
productions
they
will
give
you
soup
when
turtle
would
be
much
cheaper
roast
beef
and
beefsteaks
are
found
at
almost
every
meal
an
immense
deal
of
beer
is
consumed
when
yams
avocado
pears
the
mountain
cabbage
plaintains
and
twenty
other
delicious
vegetables
may
be
had
for
the
gathering
people
will
insist
on
eating
bad
english
potatoes
and
the
desire
for
english
pickles
is
quite
a
passion
this
is
one
phase
of
that
love
for
england
which
is
so
predominant
a
characteristic
of
the
white
inhabitants
of
the
west
indies
at
the
inns
as
at
the
private
houses
the
household
servants
are
almost
always
black
the
manners
of
these
people
are
to
a
stranger
very
strange
they
are
not
absolutely
uncivil
except
on
occasions
but
they
have
an
easy
free
patronizing
air
if
you
find
fault
with
them
they
insist
on
having
the
last
word
and
are
generally
successful
they
do
not
appear
to
be
greedy
of
money
rarely
ask
for
it
and
express
but
little
thankfulness
when
they
get
it
at
home
in
england
one
is
apt
to
think
that
an
extra
shilling
will
go
a
long
way
with
boots
and
chambermaid
and
produce
hotter
water
more
copious
towels
and
quicker
attendance
than
is
ordinary
but
in
the
west
indies
a
similar
result
does
not
follow
in
a
similar
degree
and
in
the
west
indies
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
these
people
should
be
treated
with
dignity
and
it
is
not
always
very
easy
to
reach
the
proper
point
of
dignity
they
like
familiarity
but
are
singularly
averse
to
ridicule
and
though
they
wish
to
be
on
good
terms
with
you
they
do
not
choose
that
these
shall
be
reached
without
the
proper
degree
of
antecedent
ceremony
halloo
old
fellow
how
about
that
bath
i
said
one
morning
to
a
lad
who
had
been
commissioned
to
see
a
bath
filled
for
me
he
was
cleaning
boots
at
the
time
and
went
on
with
his
employment
sedulously
as
though
he
had
not
heard
a
word
but
he
was
over
sedulous
and
i
saw
that
he
heard
me
i
say
how
about
that
bath
i
continued
but
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
put
down
those
boots
sir
i
said
going
up
to
him
and
go
and
do
as
i
bid
you
who
you
call
fellor
you
speak
to
a
and
den
he
fill
de
bath
james
said
i
might
i
trouble
you
to
leave
those
boots
and
see
the
bath
filled
for
me
and
i
bowed
to
him
sir
he
answered
returning
my
bow
go
at
once
and
so
he
did
perfectly
satisfied
had
he
imagined
however
that
i
was
quizzing
him
in
all
probability
he
would
not
have
gone
at
all
there
will
be
those
who
will
say
that
i
had
received
a
good
lesson
and
perhaps
i
had
but
it
would
be
rather
cumbersome
if
we
were
forced
to
treat
our
juvenile
servants
at
home
in
this
manner
or
even
those
who
are
not
juvenile
i
must
say
this
for
the
servants
that
i
never
knew
them
to
steal
anything
or
heard
of
their
doing
so
from
any
one
else
if
any
one
deserves
to
be
robbed
i
deserve
it
for
i
leave
my
keys
and
my
money
everywhere
and
seldom
find
time
to
lock
my
portmanteau
but
my
carelessness
was
not
punished
in
jamaica
and
this
i
think
is
the
character
of
the
people
as
regards
absolute
personal
property
personal
property
that
has
been
housed
and
garnered
that
has
as
it
were
been
made
the
possessor
very
own
there
can
be
no
more
diligent
thieves
than
they
are
in
appropriating
to
themselves
the
fruits
of
the
earth
while
they
are
still
on
the
trees
they
will
not
understand
that
this
is
stealing
nor
can
much
be
said
for
their
honesty
in
dealing
there
is
a
great
difference
between
cheating
and
stealing
in
the
minds
of
many
men
whether
they
be
black
or
white
there
are
good
shops
in
kingston
and
i
believe
that
men
in
trade
are
making
money
there
i
can
not
tell
on
what
principle
prices
range
themselves
as
compared
with
those
in
england
some
things
are
considerably
cheaper
than
with
us
and
some
much
very
much
dearer
a
pair
of
excellent
duck
trousers
if
i
may
be
excused
for
alluding
to
them
cost
me
eighteen
shillings
when
made
to
order
whereas
a
pair
of
evening
white
gloves
could
not
be
had
under
that
at
least
was
the
price
charged
though
i
am
bound
to
own
that
the
considerately
returned
me
sixpence
discount
for
ready
money
the
men
in
the
shops
are
generally
of
the
coloured
race
and
they
are
also
extremely
free
and
easy
in
their
manners
from
them
this
is
more
disagreeable
than
from
the
negroes
for
white
gloves
i
said
is
not
that
high
not
at
all
sir
by
no
means
we
consider
it
rather
cheap
but
in
kingston
sir
you
must
not
think
about
little
economies
and
he
leered
at
me
in
a
very
nauseous
manner
as
he
tied
his
parcel
however
i
ought
to
forgive
him
for
did
he
not
return
to
me
sixpence
discount
unasked
there
are
various
places
of
worship
in
kingston
and
the
negroes
are
fond
of
attending
them
but
they
love
best
that
class
of
religion
which
allows
them
to
hear
the
most
of
their
own
voices
they
are
therefore
fond
of
baptists
and
fonder
of
the
wesleyans
than
of
the
church
of
england
many
also
are
roman
catholics
their
are
constantly
to
be
heard
as
one
walks
through
the
streets
no
religion
is
worth
anything
to
them
which
does
not
offer
the
allurement
of
some
excitement
very
little
excitement
is
to
be
found
in
the
kingston
parish
church
the
church
itself
with
its
rickety
pews
and
creaking
doors
and
wretched
seats
made
purposely
so
as
to
render
genuflexion
impossible
and
the
sleepy
droning
somnolent
service
are
exactly
what
was
so
common
in
england
twenty
years
since
but
which
are
common
no
longer
thanks
to
certain
clerical
gentlemen
not
but
that
it
may
still
be
found
in
england
if
diligently
sought
for
but
i
must
not
finish
my
notice
on
the
town
of
kingston
without
a
word
of
allusion
to
my
enemies
the
musquitoes
let
no
european
attempt
to
sleep
there
at
any
time
of
the
year
without
if
he
do
it
will
only
be
an
attempt
which
will
probably
end
in
madness
and
fever
before
morning
nor
will
suffice
unless
they
are
brushed
out
with
no
ordinary
care
and
then
tucked
in
and
unless
also
the
after
having
cunningly
crept
into
his
bed
at
the
smallest
available
aperture
carefully
pins
up
that
aperture
your
kingston
musquito
is
the
craftiest
of
insects
and
the
most
deadly
chapter
iii
jamaica
country
i
have
spoken
in
disparaging
terms
of
the
chief
town
in
jamaica
but
i
can
atone
for
this
by
speaking
in
very
high
terms
of
the
country
in
that
island
one
would
certainly
prefer
the
life
of
the
country
mouse
there
is
scenery
in
jamaica
which
almost
equals
that
of
switzerland
and
the
tyrol
and
there
is
also
which
is
more
essential
a
temperature
among
the
mountains
in
which
a
european
can
live
comfortably
i
travelled
over
the
greater
part
of
the
island
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
it
the
drawbacks
on
such
a
tour
are
the
expensiveness
of
locomotion
the
want
of
hotels
and
the
badness
of
the
roads
as
to
cost
the
tourist
always
consoles
himself
by
reflecting
that
he
is
going
to
take
the
expensive
journey
once
and
once
only
the
badness
of
the
roads
forms
an
additional
excitement
and
the
want
of
hotels
is
cured
as
it
probably
has
been
caused
by
the
hospitality
of
the
gentry
and
they
are
very
hospitable
and
hospitable
too
under
adverse
circumstances
in
olden
times
when
nobody
anywhere
was
so
rich
as
a
jamaica
planter
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
should
be
always
glad
to
see
his
own
friends
and
his
friends
friends
and
their
friends
such
visits
dissipated
the
ennui
of
his
own
life
and
the
expense
was
not
appreciable
or
at
any
rate
not
undesirable
an
open
house
was
his
usual
rule
of
life
but
matters
are
much
altered
with
him
now
if
he
be
a
planter
of
the
olden
days
he
will
have
passed
through
fire
and
water
in
his
endeavours
to
maintain
his
position
if
as
is
more
frequently
the
case
he
be
a
man
of
new
date
on
his
estate
he
will
probably
have
established
himself
with
a
small
capital
and
he
also
will
have
to
struggle
but
nevertheless
the
hospitality
is
maintained
perhaps
not
on
the
olden
scale
yet
on
a
scale
that
by
no
means
requires
to
be
enlarged
it
is
rather
hard
on
us
said
a
young
planter
to
me
with
whom
i
was
on
terms
of
sufficient
intimacy
to
discuss
such
matters
we
send
word
to
the
people
at
home
that
we
are
very
poor
they
wo
quite
believe
us
so
they
send
out
somebody
to
see
the
somebody
comes
a
fellow
and
we
kill
our
little
fatted
calf
for
him
probably
it
is
only
a
ewe
lamb
we
bring
out
our
bottle
or
two
of
the
best
that
has
been
put
by
for
a
gala
day
and
so
we
make
his
heart
glad
he
goes
home
and
what
does
he
say
of
us
these
jamaica
planters
are
princes
the
best
fellows
living
i
liked
them
amazingly
but
as
for
their
poverty
do
believe
a
word
of
it
they
swim
in
claret
and
usually
bathe
in
champagne
now
that
is
hard
seeing
that
our
common
fare
is
salt
fish
and
rum
and
water
i
advised
him
in
future
to
receive
such
inquirers
with
his
ordinary
fare
only
yes
said
he
and
then
we
should
get
it
on
the
other
cheek
we
should
be
abused
for
our
stinginess
no
jamaica
man
could
stand
that
it
is
of
course
known
that
the
is
the
chief
production
of
jamaica
but
one
may
travel
for
days
in
the
island
and
only
see
a
cane
piece
here
and
there
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
the
island
is
covered
with
wild
wood
and
jungle
what
is
there
called
bush
through
this
on
an
occasional
favourable
spot
and
very
frequently
on
the
roadsides
one
sees
the
gardens
or
of
the
negroes
these
are
spots
of
land
cultivated
by
them
for
which
they
either
pay
rent
or
on
which
as
is
quite
as
common
they
have
squatted
without
payment
of
any
rent
these
are
very
picturesque
they
are
not
filled
as
a
peasant
garden
in
england
or
in
ireland
is
filled
with
potatoes
and
cabbages
or
other
vegetables
similarly
uninteresting
in
their
growth
but
contain
oranges
mangoes
limes
plantains
jack
fruit
avocado
pears
and
a
score
of
others
all
of
which
are
luxuriant
trees
some
of
considerable
size
and
all
of
them
of
great
beauty
the
and
the
mango
are
especially
lovely
and
i
know
nothing
prettier
than
a
grove
of
oranges
in
jamaica
in
addition
to
this
they
always
have
the
yam
which
is
with
the
negro
somewhat
as
the
potato
is
with
the
irishman
only
that
the
irishman
has
nothing
else
whereas
the
negro
generally
has
either
fish
or
meat
and
has
also
a
score
of
other
fruits
besides
the
yam
the
yam
too
is
picturesque
in
its
growth
as
with
the
potato
the
root
alone
is
eaten
but
the
upper
part
is
fostered
and
cared
for
as
a
creeper
so
that
the
ground
may
be
unencumbered
by
its
thick
tendrils
support
is
provided
for
it
as
for
grapes
or
peas
then
one
sees
also
in
these
patches
of
coffee
and
arrowroot
and
occasionally
also
patches
of
a
man
wishing
to
see
the
main
features
of
the
whole
island
and
proceeding
from
kingston
as
his
must
take
two
distinct
tours
one
to
the
east
and
the
other
to
the
west
the
former
may
be
best
done
on
horseback
as
the
roads
are
one
may
say
for
a
considerable
portion
of
the
way
and
sometimes
almost
worse
than
in
other
places
one
of
the
most
remarkable
characteristics
of
jamaica
is
the
copiousness
of
its
rivers
it
is
said
that
its
original
name
xaymaca
signifies
a
country
of
streams
and
it
certainly
is
not
undeserved
this
copiousness
though
it
adds
to
the
beauty
as
no
doubt
it
does
also
to
its
salubrity
and
fertility
adds
something
too
to
the
difficulty
of
locomotion
bridges
have
not
been
built
or
sad
to
say
have
been
allowed
to
go
to
destruction
one
hears
that
this
river
or
that
river
is
down
whereby
it
is
signified
that
the
waters
are
swollen
and
some
of
the
rivers
when
so
down
are
certainly
not
easy
of
passage
such
impediments
are
more
frequent
in
the
east
than
elsewhere
and
on
this
account
travelling
on
horseback
is
the
safest
as
well
as
the
most
expeditious
means
of
transit
i
found
four
horses
to
be
necessary
one
for
the
groom
one
for
my
clothes
and
two
for
myself
a
lighter
weight
might
have
done
with
three
an
englishman
feels
some
bashfulness
in
riding
up
to
a
door
with
such
a
cortége
and
bearing
as
an
introduction
a
message
from
somebody
else
to
say
that
you
are
to
be
entertained
but
i
always
found
that
such
a
message
was
a
sufficient
passport
it
is
our
way
one
gentleman
said
to
me
in
answer
to
my
apology
when
four
or
five
come
in
for
dinner
after
ten
at
night
we
do
think
it
hard
seeing
that
meat
wo
keep
in
this
country
hotels
as
an
institution
are
on
the
whole
a
comfortable
arrangement
one
prefers
perhaps
ordering
one
dinner
to
asking
for
it
and
many
men
delight
in
the
wide
capability
of
finding
fault
which
an
inn
affords
but
they
are
very
hostile
to
the
spirit
of
hospitality
the
time
will
soon
come
when
the
backwoodsman
will
have
his
tariff
for
public
accommodation
and
an
arab
will
charge
you
a
fixed
price
for
his
pipe
and
cup
of
coffee
in
the
desert
but
that
era
has
not
yet
been
reached
in
jamaica
crossing
the
same
river
times
is
tedious
especially
if
this
is
done
in
heavy
rain
when
the
road
is
a
narrow
track
through
ravines
and
when
an
open
umbrella
is
absolutely
necessary
but
so
often
had
we
to
cross
the
in
our
route
from
kingston
to
the
northern
shore
it
was
here
that
i
first
saw
the
full
effect
of
tropical
vegetation
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
perhaps
the
most
graceful
of
all
the
woodland
productions
is
the
bamboo
it
grows
either
in
clusters
like
clumps
of
trees
in
an
english
park
or
as
is
more
usual
when
found
in
its
indigenous
state
in
long
rows
by
the
riversides
the
trunk
of
the
bamboo
is
a
huge
hollow
cane
bearing
no
leaves
except
at
its
head
one
such
cane
alone
would
be
uninteresting
enough
but
their
great
height
the
peculiarly
graceful
curve
of
their
growth
and
the
excessive
thickness
of
the
drooping
foliage
of
hundreds
of
them
clustered
together
produce
an
effect
which
nothing
can
surpass
the
is
almost
as
beautiful
when
standing
alone
the
trunk
of
this
tree
grows
to
a
magnificent
height
and
with
magnificent
proportions
it
is
frequently
straight
and
those
which
are
most
beautiful
throw
out
no
branches
till
they
have
reached
a
height
greater
than
that
of
any
ordinary
tree
with
us
nature
in
order
to
sustain
so
large
a
mass
supplies
it
with
huge
spurs
at
the
foot
which
act
as
buttresses
for
its
support
connecting
the
roots
immediately
with
the
trunk
as
much
as
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
i
measured
more
than
one
which
including
the
buttresses
were
over
thirty
feet
in
circumference
then
from
its
head
the
branches
break
forth
in
most
luxurious
profusion
covering
an
enormous
extent
of
ground
with
their
shade
but
the
most
striking
peculiarity
of
these
trees
consists
in
the
parasite
plants
by
which
they
are
enveloped
and
which
hang
from
their
branches
down
to
the
ground
with
tendrils
of
wonderful
strength
these
parasites
are
of
various
kinds
the
fig
being
the
most
obdurate
with
its
embraces
it
frequently
may
be
seen
that
the
original
tree
has
departed
wholly
from
sight
and
i
should
imagine
almost
wholly
from
existence
and
then
the
very
name
is
changed
and
the
is
called
a
in
others
the
process
of
destruction
may
be
observed
and
the
interior
trunk
may
be
seen
to
be
stayed
in
its
growth
and
stunted
in
its
measure
by
the
creepers
which
surround
it
this
pernicious
embrace
the
natives
describe
as
the
scotchman
hugging
the
creole
the
metaphor
is
sufficiently
satirical
upon
our
northern
friends
who
are
supposed
not
to
have
thriven
badly
in
their
visits
to
the
western
islands
but
it
often
happens
that
the
tree
has
reached
its
full
growth
before
the
parasites
have
fallen
on
it
and
then
in
place
of
being
strangled
it
is
adorned
every
branch
is
covered
with
a
wondrous
growth
with
plants
of
a
thousand
colours
and
a
thousand
sorts
some
droop
with
long
and
graceful
tendrils
from
the
boughs
and
so
touch
the
ground
while
others
hang
in
a
ball
of
leaves
and
flowers
which
swing
for
years
apparently
without
changing
their
position
the
growth
of
these
parasite
plants
must
be
slow
though
it
is
so
very
rich
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
was
staying
and
in
whose
grounds
i
saw
by
far
the
most
lovely
tree
of
this
description
that
met
my
sight
assured
me
that
he
had
watched
it
closely
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
that
he
could
trace
no
difference
in
the
size
or
arrangement
of
the
parasite
plants
by
which
it
was
surrounded
we
went
across
the
island
to
a
little
village
called
annotta
bay
traversing
the
times
as
i
have
said
and
from
thence
through
the
parishes
of
metcalf
and
george
to
port
antonio
fuit
ilium
et
ingens
gloria
this
may
certainly
be
said
of
port
antonio
and
the
adjacent
district
it
was
once
a
military
station
and
the
empty
barracks
standing
so
beautifully
over
the
sea
on
an
extreme
point
of
land
are
now
waiting
till
time
shall
reduce
them
to
ruin
the
place
is
utterly
desolate
though
not
yet
broken
up
in
its
desolation
as
such
buildings
quickly
become
when
left
wholly
untenanted
a
rusty
cannon
or
two
still
stand
at
the
embrasures
watching
the
entrance
to
the
fort
and
among
the
grass
we
found
a
few
metal
balls
the
last
remains
of
the
last
ordnance
supplies
but
port
antonio
was
once
a
goodly
town
and
the
country
round
it
the
parish
of
portland
is
as
fertile
as
any
in
the
island
but
now
there
is
hardly
a
sugar
estate
in
the
whole
parish
it
is
given
up
to
the
growth
of
yams
cocoas
and
plantains
it
has
become
a
for
negroes
and
the
palmy
days
of
the
town
are
of
course
gone
nevertheless
there
was
a
decent
little
inn
at
port
antonio
which
will
always
be
memorable
to
me
on
account
of
the
love
sorrows
of
a
young
maiden
whom
i
chanced
to
meet
there
the
meeting
was
in
this
wise
i
was
sitting
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
after
dinner
when
a
young
lady
walked
in
dressed
altogether
in
white
and
she
was
well
dressed
and
not
without
the
ordinary
decoration
of
crinoline
and
ribbons
she
was
of
the
coloured
race
and
her
jet
black
crisp
yet
wavy
hair
was
brushed
back
in
a
becoming
fashion
whence
she
came
or
who
she
was
i
did
not
know
and
never
learnt
that
she
was
familiar
in
the
house
i
presumed
from
her
moving
the
books
and
little
ornaments
on
the
table
and
arranging
the
cups
and
shells
upon
a
shelf
she
ejaculated
when
i
had
watched
her
for
about
a
minute
i
hardly
knew
how
to
accost
her
for
i
object
to
the
word
miss
as
standing
alone
and
yet
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
accost
her
ah
well
she
repeated
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
she
had
a
grief
to
tell
lady
said
i
i
felt
that
the
address
was
somewhat
stilted
but
in
the
lack
of
any
introduction
i
knew
not
how
else
to
begin
lady
i
fear
that
you
are
in
sorrow
sorrow
enough
said
she
in
de
deepest
sorrow
me
well
de
world
will
end
some
day
and
turning
her
face
full
upon
me
she
crossed
her
hands
i
was
seated
on
a
sofa
and
she
came
and
sat
beside
me
crossing
her
hands
upon
her
lap
and
looking
away
to
the
opposite
wall
i
am
not
a
very
young
man
and
my
friends
have
told
me
that
i
show
strongly
that
steady
married
appearance
of
a
paterfamilias
which
is
so
apt
to
lend
assurance
to
maiden
timidity
it
will
end
some
day
for
us
all
i
replied
but
with
you
it
has
hardly
yet
had
its
beginning
is
a
very
bad
world
and
sooner
over
de
better
to
be
treated
enough
to
break
any
girl
heart
it
is
my
heart
clean
broke
i
know
dat
and
as
she
put
both
her
long
thin
dark
hands
to
her
side
i
saw
that
she
had
not
forgotten
her
rings
it
is
love
then
that
ails
you
no
she
said
this
very
sharply
turning
full
round
upon
me
and
fixing
her
large
black
eyes
upon
mine
no
i
do
love
him
one
bit
not
now
and
never
again
no
not
if
he
were
down
dere
begging
and
she
stamped
her
little
foot
upon
the
ground
as
though
she
had
an
imaginary
neck
beneath
her
heel
but
you
did
love
him
yes
she
spoke
very
softly
now
and
shook
her
head
gently
i
did
love
him
oh
so
much
he
was
so
handsome
so
nice
i
shall
never
see
such
a
man
again
such
eyes
such
a
mouth
and
then
his
nose
he
was
a
jew
you
know
i
had
not
known
it
before
and
received
the
information
perhaps
with
some
little
start
of
surprise
served
me
right
did
it
and
a
baptist
you
know
have
read
me
out
i
know
dat
but
i
did
seem
to
mind
it
den
and
then
she
gently
struck
one
hand
with
the
other
as
she
smiled
sweetly
in
my
face
the
trick
is
customary
with
the
coloured
women
in
the
west
indies
when
they
have
entered
upon
a
nice
familiar
pleasant
bit
of
chat
at
this
period
i
felt
myself
to
be
sufficiently
intimate
with
her
to
ask
her
name
josephine
dat
my
name
like
dat
name
it
as
pretty
as
its
owner
nearly
pretty
no
not
pretty
if
i
was
pretty
he
not
have
left
me
so
he
used
to
call
me
feeny
what
the
jew
did
i
thought
it
might
be
well
to
detract
from
the
merit
of
the
lost
admirer
a
girl
like
you
should
have
a
christian
lover
dat
what
dey
all
says
of
course
they
do
you
ought
to
be
glad
it
over
i
ai
tho
not
a
bit
tho
i
do
hate
him
so
oh
i
hate
him
i
hate
him
i
hate
him
worse
dan
poison
and
again
her
little
foot
went
to
work
i
must
confess
that
it
was
a
pretty
foot
and
as
for
her
waist
i
never
saw
one
better
turned
or
more
deftly
clothed
her
little
foot
went
to
work
upon
the
floor
and
then
clenching
her
small
right
hand
she
held
it
up
before
my
face
as
though
to
show
me
that
she
knew
how
to
menace
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
told
her
that
those
fingers
had
not
been
made
for
threats
you
are
a
christian
said
i
and
should
forgive
a
baptist
she
replied
and
in
course
i
does
forgive
him
i
does
forgive
him
but
he
be
wretched
in
this
life
i
know
and
she
she
be
wretcheder
and
when
he
dies
in
that
prolonged
expression
there
was
a
curse
as
deep
as
any
that
ernulphus
ever
gave
alas
such
is
the
forgiveness
of
too
many
a
christian
as
for
me
i
would
demean
myself
to
touch
de
hem
of
her
garment
poor
fellow
what
a
life
he
have
for
she
a
virgo
with
a
vengeance
this
at
the
moment
astonished
me
but
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
lady
speech
i
was
at
once
convinced
that
no
satirical
allusion
was
intended
in
the
hurry
of
her
fluttering
thoughts
she
had
merely
omitted
the
letter
a
it
was
her
rival
temper
not
her
virtue
that
she
doubted
the
jew
is
going
to
be
married
then
he
told
her
so
but
he
jilt
her
too
you
know
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
idea
was
not
an
unpleasant
one
and
then
he
come
back
to
you
yes
yes
and
i
spit
at
him
and
in
the
fury
of
her
mind
she
absolutely
did
perform
the
operation
i
wish
he
would
i
sit
so
and
listen
to
him
and
she
crossed
her
hands
and
assumed
an
air
of
dignified
quiescence
which
well
became
her
i
listen
every
word
he
say
just
so
every
word
till
he
done
and
i
smile
and
she
did
smile
and
den
when
he
offer
me
his
hand
and
she
put
out
her
own
i
spit
at
him
and
leave
him
so
and
rising
majestically
from
her
seat
she
stalked
out
of
the
room
as
she
fully
closed
the
door
behind
her
i
thought
that
the
interview
was
over
and
that
i
should
see
no
more
of
my
fair
friend
but
in
this
i
was
mistaken
the
door
was
soon
reopened
and
she
again
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
beside
me
your
heart
would
permit
of
your
doing
that
said
i
and
he
with
such
a
beautiful
nose
yes
it
would
i
myself
to
take
him
now
if
he
was
ever
so
beautiful
but
sure
of
this
i
never
love
no
oder
man
never
again
he
did
dance
so
genteelly
a
baptist
dance
i
exclaimed
well
it
was
de
ting
was
it
and
i
knew
i
be
read
out
oh
but
it
was
so
nice
i
never
have
no
more
dancing
now
i
just
taken
up
with
a
class
now
you
know
since
he
gone
taken
up
with
a
class
yes
i
teaches
the
nigger
children
and
i
has
a
card
for
the
minister
i
got
four
dollars
last
week
and
you
must
give
me
something
now
i
hate
baptists
as
she
did
her
lover
like
poison
and
even
under
such
pressure
as
this
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
aid
in
their
support
you
very
stingy
man
caspar
isaacs
he
was
her
lost
lover
gave
me
a
dollar
but
perhaps
you
gave
him
a
kiss
perhaps
i
did
said
she
but
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
this
quite
i
never
give
him
anoder
and
she
again
slapped
one
hand
upon
the
other
and
compressed
her
lips
and
gently
shook
her
head
as
she
made
the
declaration
i
never
give
him
anoder
kiss
dat
sure
as
fate
i
had
nothing
further
to
say
and
began
to
feel
that
i
ought
not
to
detain
the
lady
longer
we
sat
together
however
silent
for
a
while
and
then
she
arose
and
spoke
to
me
standing
in
a
difficulty
now
however
and
it
just
about
that
i
am
come
to
ask
you
well
josephine
anything
that
i
can
do
to
help
you
much
i
only
want
your
advice
going
to
kingston
you
see
ah
you
find
another
lover
there
it
not
for
dat
den
for
i
do
want
none
but
going
anyways
i
live
dere
oh
you
live
at
kingston
course
i
does
and
no
ways
to
go
but
just
in
de
droger
the
west
indian
coasting
vessels
are
so
called
do
you
like
going
in
the
droger
i
asked
oh
yes
i
likes
it
well
enough
are
you
oh
no
then
what
the
harm
of
the
droger
why
you
see
and
she
turned
away
her
face
and
looked
towards
the
window
why
you
see
isaacs
is
the
captain
of
her
and
be
so
odd
like
you
could
not
possibly
have
a
better
opportunity
for
recovering
all
that
you
have
lost
you
tink
so
certainly
den
you
know
noting
about
it
i
will
never
recover
noting
of
him
never
bah
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
pay
him
my
pound
for
my
passage
and
den
it
be
a
purely
transaction
on
this
point
i
agreed
with
her
and
then
she
offered
me
her
hand
with
the
view
of
bidding
me
farewell
josephine
i
said
perhaps
you
would
be
happier
with
a
christian
husband
i
would
better
with
none
at
all
but
i
do
tink
i
ever
be
happy
no
more
is
so
dull
were
i
a
girl
i
doubt
whether
i
also
would
not
sooner
dance
with
a
jew
than
pray
with
a
baptist
josephine
i
pressed
her
hand
and
so
she
went
and
i
never
saw
nor
heard
more
of
her
there
was
not
about
my
josephine
all
the
pathos
of
maria
nor
can
i
tell
my
story
as
sterne
told
his
but
josephine
in
her
sorrow
was
i
think
more
true
to
human
nature
than
maria
it
may
perhaps
be
possible
that
sterne
embellished
his
facts
i
at
any
rate
have
not
done
that
i
had
another
adventure
at
port
antonio
about
two
in
the
morning
there
was
an
earthquake
and
we
were
all
nearly
shaken
out
of
our
beds
some
one
rushed
into
my
room
declaring
that
not
a
stone
would
be
left
standing
of
port
royal
there
were
two
distinct
blows
separated
by
some
seconds
and
a
loud
noise
was
heard
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
frightened
as
i
had
not
time
to
realize
the
fact
of
the
earthquake
before
it
was
all
over
no
harm
was
done
i
believe
anywhere
beyond
the
disseverance
of
a
little
plaster
from
the
walls
the
largest
expanse
of
unbroken
in
jamaica
is
at
the
extreme
in
the
parish
of
george
in
the
east
here
i
saw
a
plain
of
about
four
thousand
acres
under
canes
it
looked
to
be
prosperous
but
i
was
told
by
the
planter
with
whom
i
was
staying
that
the
land
had
lately
been
deluged
with
water
that
the
canes
were
covered
with
mud
and
that
the
crops
would
be
very
short
poor
jamaica
it
seems
as
though
all
the
elements
are
in
league
against
her
i
was
not
sorry
to
return
to
kingston
from
this
trip
for
i
was
tired
of
the
saddle
in
jamaica
everybody
rides
but
nobody
seems
to
get
much
beyond
a
walk
now
to
me
there
is
no
pace
on
horseback
so
wearying
as
an
unbroken
walk
i
did
goad
my
horse
into
trotting
but
it
was
clear
that
the
animal
was
not
used
to
it
shortly
afterwards
i
went
to
the
west
the
distances
here
were
longer
but
the
journey
was
made
on
wheels
and
was
not
so
fatiguing
moreover
i
stayed
some
little
time
with
a
friend
in
one
of
the
distant
parishes
of
the
island
the
scenery
during
the
whole
expedition
was
very
grand
the
road
goes
through
spanish
town
and
then
divides
itself
one
road
going
westward
by
the
northern
coast
and
the
other
by
that
to
the
south
i
went
by
the
former
and
began
my
journey
by
the
bog
or
bogue
walk
a
road
through
a
magnificent
ravine
and
then
over
mount
diabolo
the
devil
assumes
to
himself
all
the
finest
scenery
in
all
countries
of
a
delicious
mountain
tarn
he
makes
his
he
loves
to
leap
from
crag
to
crag
over
the
wildest
ravines
he
builds
picturesque
bridges
in
most
impassable
sites
and
makes
roads
over
mountains
at
gradients
not
to
be
attempted
by
the
wildest
engineer
the
road
over
mount
diabolo
is
very
fine
and
the
view
back
to
kingston
very
grand
from
thence
i
went
down
into
the
parish
of
anns
on
the
northern
side
they
all
speak
of
anns
as
being
the
most
fertile
district
in
the
island
the
inhabitants
are
addicted
to
grazing
rather
than
sugarmaking
and
thrive
in
that
pursuit
very
well
but
all
jamaica
is
suited
for
a
and
all
the
west
indies
should
be
the
market
for
their
cattle
on
the
northern
coast
there
are
two
towns
falmouth
and
montego
bay
both
of
which
are
at
any
rate
in
appearance
more
prosperous
than
kingston
i
can
not
say
that
the
streets
are
alive
with
trade
but
they
do
not
appear
to
be
so
neglected
desolate
and
wretched
as
the
metropolis
or
the
seat
of
government
they
have
jails
and
hospitals
mayors
and
magistrates
and
are
except
in
atmosphere
very
like
small
country
towns
in
england
the
two
furthermost
parishes
of
jamaica
are
hanover
and
westmoreland
and
i
stayed
for
a
short
time
with
a
gentleman
who
lives
on
the
borders
of
the
two
i
certainly
was
never
in
a
more
lovely
country
he
was
a
sugar
planter
but
the
canes
and
sugar
which
after
all
are
ugly
and
by
no
means
savoury
appurtenances
were
located
somewhere
out
of
sight
as
far
as
i
myself
might
know
from
what
i
saw
my
host
ordinary
occupations
were
exactly
those
of
a
country
gentleman
in
england
he
fished
and
shot
and
looked
after
his
estate
and
acted
as
a
magistrate
and
over
and
above
this
was
somewhat
particular
about
his
dinner
and
the
ornamentation
of
the
land
immediately
round
his
house
i
do
not
know
that
fate
can
give
a
man
a
pleasanter
life
if
however
he
did
at
unseen
moments
inspect
his
and
employ
himself
among
the
sugar
hogsheads
and
rum
puncheons
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
had
a
serious
drawback
on
his
happiness
country
life
in
jamaica
certainly
has
its
attractions
the
day
is
generally
begun
at
six
when
a
cup
of
coffee
is
brought
in
by
a
sable
minister
i
believe
it
is
customary
to
take
this
in
bed
or
rather
on
the
bed
for
in
jamaica
one
connection
with
one
bed
does
not
amount
to
getting
into
it
one
gets
within
the
musquito
net
and
then
plunges
about
with
a
loose
sheet
which
is
sometimes
on
and
sometimes
off
with
the
cup
of
coffee
comes
a
small
modicum
of
dry
toast
after
that
the
toilet
progresses
not
at
a
rapid
pace
a
tub
of
cold
water
and
dilettante
dressing
will
do
something
more
than
kill
an
hour
so
that
it
is
seven
or
eight
before
one
leaves
room
when
one
first
arrives
in
the
west
indies
one
hears
much
of
early
morning
exercise
especially
for
ladies
and
for
ladies
early
morning
exercise
is
the
only
exercise
possible
but
it
appeared
to
me
that
i
heard
more
of
it
than
i
saw
and
even
as
regards
early
travelling
the
eager
promise
was
generally
broken
an
assumed
start
at
five
usually
meant
seven
and
one
at
six
eight
this
however
is
the
time
of
day
at
which
the
sugar
grower
is
presumed
to
look
at
his
canes
and
the
grazier
to
inspect
his
kine
at
this
hour
eight
that
is
the
men
ride
and
also
the
ladies
and
when
the
latter
ceremony
does
take
place
there
is
no
pleasanter
hour
in
all
the
at
ten
or
ten
the
nation
sits
down
to
breakfast
not
to
a
meal
my
dear
jones
consisting
of
tea
and
bread
and
butter
with
two
eggs
for
the
master
of
the
family
and
one
for
the
mistress
but
a
stout
solid
banquet
consisting
of
fish
beefsteaks
a
breakfast
is
not
a
breakfast
in
the
west
indies
without
beefsteaks
and
onions
nor
is
a
dinner
so
to
be
called
without
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
potatoes
yams
plaintains
eggs
and
half
a
dozen
tinned
productions
namely
meats
sent
from
england
in
tin
cases
though
they
have
every
delicacy
which
the
world
can
give
them
of
native
production
all
these
are
as
nothing
unless
they
also
have
something
from
england
then
there
are
tea
and
chocolate
upon
the
table
and
on
the
sideboard
beer
and
wine
rum
and
brandy
is
so
that
they
breakfast
at
rural
quarters
in
jamaica
then
comes
the
day
ladies
may
not
subject
their
fair
skin
to
the
outrages
of
a
tropical
sun
and
therefore
unless
on
very
special
occasions
they
do
not
go
out
between
breakfast
and
dinner
that
they
occupy
themselves
well
during
the
while
charity
feels
convinced
sarcasm
however
says
that
they
do
not
sin
from
over
energy
for
my
own
part
i
do
not
care
a
doit
for
sarcasm
when
their
lords
reappear
they
are
always
found
smiling
and
pretty
and
then
after
dinner
they
have
but
one
sin
there
is
but
one
drawback
they
will
go
to
bed
at
but
by
the
men
during
the
day
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
the
sun
was
much
regarded
or
that
it
need
be
much
regarded
one
can
not
and
certainly
should
not
walk
much
and
no
one
does
walk
a
horse
is
there
as
a
matter
of
course
and
one
walks
upon
that
not
a
great
beast
sixteen
hands
high
requiring
all
manner
of
levers
between
its
jaws
capricoling
and
prancing
about
and
giving
a
man
a
deal
of
work
merely
to
keep
his
seat
and
look
stately
but
a
canny
little
quiet
brute
fed
chiefly
on
grass
patient
of
the
sun
and
not
inclined
to
be
troublesome
with
such
legs
under
him
and
at
a
distance
of
some
twenty
miles
from
the
coast
a
man
may
get
about
in
jamaica
pretty
nearly
as
well
as
he
can
in
england
i
saw
various
grazing
farms
pens
they
are
here
called
while
i
was
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
i
could
not
but
fancy
that
grazing
should
in
jamaica
be
the
natural
and
most
beneficial
pursuit
of
the
proprietor
as
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
it
certainly
is
in
ireland
i
never
saw
grass
to
equal
the
guinea
grass
in
some
of
the
parishes
and
at
knockalva
i
looked
at
hereford
cattle
which
i
have
rarely
if
ever
seen
beaten
at
any
agricultural
show
in
england
at
present
the
island
does
not
altogether
supply
itself
with
meat
but
it
might
do
so
and
supply
moreover
nearly
the
whole
of
the
remaining
west
indies
proprietors
of
land
say
that
the
sea
transit
is
too
costly
of
course
it
is
at
present
the
trade
not
yet
existing
for
indeed
at
present
there
is
no
means
of
such
transit
but
screw
steamers
now
always
appear
quickly
enough
wherever
freight
offers
itself
and
if
the
cattle
were
there
they
would
soon
find
their
way
down
to
the
windward
islands
but
i
am
running
away
from
my
day
the
inspection
of
a
pen
or
two
perhaps
occasionally
of
the
sugar
works
when
they
are
about
soon
wears
through
the
hours
and
at
five
preparations
commence
for
the
six
dinner
the
dressing
again
is
a
dilettante
process
even
for
the
least
dandified
of
mankind
it
is
astonishing
how
much
men
think
and
must
think
of
their
clothes
when
within
the
tropics
dressing
is
necessarily
done
slowly
or
else
one
gets
heated
quicker
than
one
has
cooled
down
and
then
one
clothes
always
want
airing
and
the
supply
of
clean
linen
is
necessarily
copious
or
at
any
rate
should
be
so
let
no
man
think
that
he
can
dress
for
dinner
in
ten
minutes
because
he
is
accustomed
to
do
so
in
england
he
can
not
brush
his
hair
or
pull
on
his
boots
or
fasten
his
buttons
at
the
same
pace
he
does
at
home
he
dries
his
face
very
leisurely
and
sits
down
gravely
to
rest
before
he
draws
on
his
black
pantaloons
dressing
for
dinner
however
is
in
the
west
indies
if
a
black
coat
could
be
laid
aside
anywhere
as
barbaric
and
light
loose
clothing
adopted
this
should
be
done
here
the
soldiers
at
least
the
privates
are
already
dressed
as
zouaves
and
children
and
negroes
are
hardly
dressed
at
all
but
the
visitor
victim
of
tropical
fashionable
society
must
appear
in
black
clothing
because
black
clothing
is
the
thing
in
england
the
governor
wo
see
you
in
that
coat
was
said
to
me
once
on
my
way
to
spanish
town
even
on
a
morning
the
governor
did
see
me
and
as
far
as
i
could
observe
did
not
know
whether
or
no
i
had
on
any
coat
such
however
is
the
feeling
of
the
place
but
we
shall
never
get
to
dinner
this
again
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
as
indeed
where
is
it
not
while
in
england
we
are
all
writing
letters
to
the
to
ascertain
how
closely
we
can
copy
the
vices
of
apicius
on
eight
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
complaining
because
in
our
perverse
stupidity
we
can
not
pamper
our
palates
with
sufficient
variety
it
is
not
open
to
us
to
say
a
word
against
the
luxuries
of
a
west
indian
table
we
have
reached
the
days
when
a
man
not
only
eats
his
best
but
complains
bitterly
and
publicly
because
he
can
not
eat
better
when
we
sigh
out
loud
because
no
horace
will
teach
us
where
the
sweetest
cabbage
grows
how
best
to
souse
our
living
poultry
so
that
their
fibres
when
cooked
may
not
offend
our
teeth
these
lessons
of
horace
are
accounted
among
his
satires
but
what
of
that
that
which
was
satire
to
augustine
rome
shall
be
simple
homely
teaching
to
the
subject
of
victoria
with
his
thousand
a
year
but
the
cook
in
the
jamaica
country
house
is
a
person
of
importance
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
lady
whom
i
have
accused
of
idleness
does
during
those
vacant
interlunar
hours
occasionally
peer
into
her
kitchen
the
results
at
any
rate
are
good
sufficiently
so
to
break
the
hearts
of
some
of
our
miserable
eight
hundred
a
year
men
at
home
after
dinner
no
wine
is
taken
none
at
least
beyond
one
glass
with
the
ladies
and
if
you
choose
it
one
after
they
are
gone
before
dinner
as
i
should
have
mentioned
before
a
glass
of
bitters
is
as
much
as
the
black
coat
i
know
how
this
will
disgust
many
a
kindly
friend
in
dear
good
old
native
england
yes
bitters
no
not
gin
and
bitters
such
as
the
cabmen
take
at
the
not
gin
and
bitters
at
all
unless
you
specially
request
it
but
sherry
and
bitters
and
a
very
pretty
habit
it
is
for
a
warm
country
if
you
do
drink
your
wine
after
dinner
why
not
take
it
before
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
more
wholesome
habit
of
the
two
not
that
i
recommend
even
in
the
warmest
climate
a
second
bitter
or
a
third
there
are
spots
in
the
west
indies
where
men
take
third
bitters
and
long
bitters
in
which
the
bitter
time
begins
when
the
soda
water
and
brandy
time
ends
in
which
the
latter
commences
when
the
breakfast
disappear
there
are
such
places
but
they
must
not
be
named
by
me
in
characters
plainly
legible
to
kiss
and
tell
is
very
criminal
as
the
whole
world
knows
but
while
on
the
subject
of
bitters
i
must
say
this
let
no
man
ever
allow
himself
to
take
a
long
bitter
such
as
men
make
at
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
stop
at
one
a
long
bitter
duly
swiggled
is
your
true
west
indian
syren
and
then
men
and
women
saunter
out
on
the
verandah
or
perhaps
if
it
be
starlight
or
moonlight
into
the
garden
oh
what
stars
they
are
those
in
that
western
tropical
world
how
beautiful
a
woman
looks
by
their
light
how
sweet
the
air
smells
how
gloriously
legible
are
the
constellations
of
the
heavens
and
then
one
sips
a
cup
of
coffee
and
there
is
a
little
chat
the
lightest
of
the
light
and
a
little
music
light
enough
also
and
at
nine
one
retires
to
one
light
slumbers
it
is
a
pleasant
life
for
a
short
time
though
the
flavour
of
the
far
is
somewhat
too
prevalent
for
saxon
energies
fresh
from
europe
such
are
the
ordinary
evenings
of
society
but
there
are
occasions
when
no
complaint
can
be
made
of
lack
of
energy
the
soul
of
a
jamaica
lady
revels
in
a
dance
dancing
is
popular
in
england
is
popular
almost
everywhere
but
in
jamaica
it
is
the
elixir
of
life
the
medea
cauldron
which
makes
old
people
young
the
cup
of
circe
which
neither
man
nor
woman
can
withstand
look
at
that
lady
who
has
been
content
to
sit
still
and
look
beautiful
for
the
last
two
hours
let
but
the
sound
of
a
polka
meet
her
and
she
will
awake
to
life
as
lively
to
motion
as
energetic
as
that
of
a
scotch
sportsman
on
the
of
august
it
is
singular
how
the
most
listless
girl
who
seems
to
trail
through
her
long
days
almost
without
moving
her
limbs
will
continue
to
waltz
and
polk
and
rush
up
and
down
a
galopade
from
ten
till
five
and
then
think
the
hours
all
too
short
and
it
is
not
the
girls
only
and
the
boys
begging
their
pardon
who
rave
for
dancing
steady
matrons
of
are
just
as
anxious
and
grave
senators
whose
years
are
past
naming
see
that
gentleman
with
the
bald
head
and
grizzled
beard
how
sedulously
he
is
making
up
his
card
madam
the
fourth
polka
he
says
to
the
stout
lady
in
the
turban
and
the
yellow
slip
who
could
not
move
yesterday
because
of
her
rheumatism
i
full
up
to
the
fifth
she
replies
looking
at
the
hanging
from
her
side
but
shall
be
so
happy
for
the
sixth
or
perhaps
the
second
schottische
and
then
after
a
little
grave
conference
the
matter
is
settled
between
them
i
hope
you
dance
quick
dances
a
lady
said
to
me
quick
i
replied
in
my
ignorance
has
not
one
to
go
by
the
music
in
jamaica
oh
you
goose
do
you
know
what
quick
dances
are
i
never
dance
anything
but
quick
dances
quadrilles
are
so
deadly
dull
i
could
not
but
be
amused
at
this
new
theory
as
to
the
quick
and
the
dead
new
at
least
to
me
though
alas
i
found
myself
tabooed
from
all
the
joys
of
the
night
by
this
invidious
distinction
in
the
west
indies
polkas
and
the
like
are
quick
dances
quadrilles
and
their
counterparts
are
simply
dead
a
lady
shows
you
no
compliment
by
giving
you
her
hand
for
the
latter
in
that
you
have
merely
to
amuse
her
by
conversation
flirting
as
any
practitioner
knows
is
spoilt
by
much
talking
many
words
make
the
amusement
either
absurd
or
serious
and
either
alternative
is
to
be
avoided
and
thus
i
soon
became
used
to
quick
dances
and
long
drinks
that
is
in
my
vocabulary
will
you
have
a
long
drink
or
a
short
one
it
sounds
odd
but
is
very
expressive
a
long
drink
is
taken
from
a
tumbler
a
short
one
from
a
the
whole
extent
of
the
choice
thus
becomes
intelligible
many
things
are
necessary
and
many
changes
must
be
made
before
jamaica
can
again
enjoy
all
her
former
prosperity
i
do
not
know
whether
the
total
abolition
of
the
growth
of
sugar
be
not
one
of
them
but
this
i
do
know
that
whatever
be
their
produce
they
must
have
roads
on
which
to
carry
it
before
they
can
grow
rich
the
roads
through
the
greater
part
of
the
island
are
very
bad
indeed
and
those
along
the
southern
coast
through
the
parishes
of
elizabeth
manchester
and
clarendon
are
by
no
means
among
the
best
i
returned
to
kingston
by
this
route
and
shall
never
forget
some
of
my
difficulties
on
the
whole
the
portion
of
the
island
is
by
no
means
equal
to
the
northern
i
took
a
third
expedition
up
to
newcastle
where
are
placed
the
barracks
for
our
white
troops
to
the
blue
mountain
peak
and
to
various
gentlemen
houses
in
these
localities
for
grandeur
of
scenery
this
is
the
finest
part
of
the
island
the
mountains
are
far
too
abrupt
and
the
land
too
much
broken
for
those
lovely
landscapes
of
which
the
parishes
of
westmoreland
and
hanover
are
full
and
of
which
stuttlestone
the
property
of
lord
howard
de
walden
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
specimen
but
nothing
can
be
grander
either
in
colour
or
grouping
than
the
ravines
of
the
blue
mountain
ranges
of
hills
perhaps
the
finest
view
in
the
island
is
from
raymond
lodge
a
house
high
up
among
the
mountains
in
which
so
local
rumour
says
cringle
log
was
written
to
reach
these
regions
a
man
must
be
an
equestrian
as
must
also
a
woman
no
lady
lives
there
so
old
but
what
she
is
to
be
seen
on
horseback
nor
any
child
so
young
babies
are
carried
up
there
on
pillows
and
whole
families
on
ponies
is
here
that
bishops
and
generals
love
to
dwell
that
their
daughters
may
have
rosy
cheeks
and
their
sons
stalwart
limbs
and
they
are
right
children
that
are
brought
up
among
these
mountains
though
they
live
but
twelve
or
eighteen
miles
from
their
young
friends
down
at
kingston
can
not
be
taken
as
belonging
to
the
same
race
i
can
imagine
no
more
healthy
climate
than
the
mountains
round
newcastle
i
shall
not
soon
forget
my
ride
to
newcastle
two
ladies
accompanied
me
and
my
excellent
friend
who
was
pioneering
me
through
the
country
and
they
were
kind
enough
to
show
us
the
way
over
all
the
passes
in
the
country
to
them
and
to
their
horses
these
were
like
easy
highroads
but
to
me
it
was
manifestly
a
disappointment
to
them
that
my
heart
did
not
faint
visibly
within
me
i
have
hunted
in
carmarthenshire
and
a
man
who
has
done
that
ought
to
be
able
to
ride
anywhere
but
in
riding
over
some
of
these
razorback
crags
my
heart
though
it
did
not
faint
visibly
did
almost
do
so
invisibly
however
we
got
safely
to
newcastle
and
our
fair
friends
returned
over
the
same
route
with
no
other
escort
than
that
of
a
black
groom
in
spite
of
the
crags
the
ride
was
not
unpleasant
one
would
almost
enlist
as
a
full
private
in
one
of
her
regiments
of
the
line
if
one
were
sure
of
being
quartered
for
ever
at
newcastle
at
newcastle
jamaica
i
mean
other
newcastles
of
which
i
wot
have
by
no
means
equal
attraction
this
place
also
is
accessible
only
by
foot
or
on
horseback
and
is
therefore
singularly
situated
for
a
barrack
but
yet
it
consists
now
of
a
goodly
village
in
which
live
colonels
and
majors
and
chaplains
and
surgeons
and
purveyors
all
in
a
state
of
bliss
as
it
were
in
a
second
eden
it
is
a
military
paradise
in
which
war
is
spoken
of
and
dinners
and
dancing
abound
if
good
air
and
fine
scenery
be
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
british
soldier
he
ought
to
be
happy
at
newcastle
nevertheless
i
prefer
the
views
from
raymond
lodge
to
any
that
newcastle
can
afford
and
now
i
have
a
mournful
story
to
tell
did
any
man
ever
know
of
any
good
befalling
him
from
going
up
a
mountain
always
excepting
albert
smith
who
we
are
told
has
realized
half
a
million
by
going
up
mont
blanc
if
a
man
can
go
up
his
mountains
in
piccadilly
it
may
be
all
very
well
in
so
doing
he
perhaps
may
see
the
sun
rise
and
be
able
to
watch
nature
in
her
wildest
vagaries
but
as
for
the
true
ascent
the
nasty
damp
dirty
slippery
veritable
mountain
let
me
recommend
my
friends
to
let
it
alone
unless
they
have
a
gift
for
making
half
a
million
in
piccadilly
i
have
tried
many
a
mountain
in
a
small
way
and
never
found
one
to
answer
i
hereby
protest
that
i
will
never
try
another
however
i
did
go
up
the
blue
mountain
peak
which
ascends
so
i
was
told
to
the
respectable
height
of
feet
above
the
sea
level
to
enable
me
to
do
this
i
provided
myself
with
a
companion
and
he
provided
me
with
five
negroes
a
supply
of
beef
bread
and
water
some
wine
and
brandy
and
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
about
ten
gallons
of
rum
for
we
were
to
spend
the
night
on
the
blue
mountain
peak
in
order
that
the
rising
sun
might
be
rightly
worshipped
for
some
considerable
distance
we
rode
till
we
came
indeed
to
the
highest
inhabited
house
in
the
island
this
is
the
property
of
a
who
lives
there
and
who
divides
his
time
and
energies
between
the
growth
of
coffee
and
the
entertainment
of
visitors
to
the
mountain
so
hospitable
an
old
gentleman
or
one
so
droll
in
speech
or
singular
in
his
mode
of
living
i
shall
probably
never
meet
again
his
tales
as
to
the
fate
of
other
travellers
made
me
tremble
for
what
might
some
day
be
told
of
my
own
adventures
he
feeds
you
gallantly
sends
you
on
your
way
with
a
and
then
hands
you
down
to
derision
with
the
wickedest
mockery
he
is
the
gibing
spirit
of
the
mountain
and
i
would
at
any
rate
recommend
no
ladies
to
trust
themselves
to
his
courtesies
here
we
entered
and
called
for
the
best
of
everything
beer
brandy
coffee
ringtailed
doves
salt
fish
fat
fowls
english
potatoes
hot
pickles
and
worcester
sauce
what
c
no
worcester
sauce
gammon
make
the
fellow
go
and
look
for
it
is
thus
hospitality
is
claimed
in
jamaica
and
in
process
of
time
the
worcester
sauce
was
forthcoming
it
must
be
remembered
that
every
article
of
food
has
to
be
carried
up
to
this
place
on
mules
backs
over
the
tops
of
mountains
for
twenty
or
thirty
miles
when
we
had
breakfasted
and
drunk
and
smoked
and
promised
our
host
that
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
feeding
us
again
on
the
morrow
we
proceeded
on
our
way
the
five
negroes
each
had
loads
on
their
heads
and
cutlasses
in
their
hands
we
ourselves
travelled
without
other
burdens
than
our
own
big
sticks
i
have
nothing
remarkable
to
tell
of
the
ascent
we
soon
got
into
a
cloud
and
never
got
out
of
it
but
that
is
a
matter
of
course
we
were
soon
wet
through
up
to
our
middles
but
that
is
a
matter
of
course
also
we
came
to
various
dreadful
passages
which
broke
our
toes
and
our
nails
and
our
hats
the
worst
of
which
was
called
jacob
ladder
also
a
matter
of
course
every
now
and
then
we
regaled
the
negroes
with
rum
and
the
more
rum
we
gave
them
the
more
they
wanted
and
every
now
and
then
we
regaled
ourselves
with
brandy
and
water
and
the
oftener
we
regaled
ourselves
the
more
we
required
to
be
regaled
all
which
things
are
matters
of
course
and
so
we
arrived
at
the
blue
mountain
peak
our
first
two
objects
were
to
construct
a
hut
and
collect
wood
for
firing
as
for
any
enjoyment
from
the
position
that
for
that
evening
was
quite
out
of
the
question
we
were
wet
through
and
through
and
could
hardly
see
twenty
yards
before
us
on
any
side
so
we
set
the
men
to
work
to
produce
such
mitigation
of
our
evil
position
as
was
possible
we
did
build
a
hut
and
we
did
make
a
fire
and
we
did
administer
more
rum
to
the
negroes
without
which
they
refused
to
work
at
all
when
a
black
man
knows
that
you
want
him
he
is
apt
to
become
very
impudent
especially
when
backed
by
rum
and
at
such
times
they
altogether
forget
or
at
any
rate
disregard
the
punishment
that
may
follow
in
the
shape
of
curtailed
gratuities
slowly
and
mournfully
we
dried
ourselves
at
the
fire
or
rather
did
not
dry
ourselves
but
scorched
our
clothes
and
burnt
our
boots
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
do
so
it
is
a
singular
fact
but
one
which
experience
has
fully
taught
me
that
when
a
man
is
thoroughly
wet
he
may
burn
his
trousers
off
his
legs
and
his
shoes
off
his
feet
and
yet
they
will
not
be
dry
nor
will
he
mournfully
we
turned
ourselves
before
the
fire
slowly
like
joints
of
meat
and
the
result
was
exactly
that
we
were
badly
roasted
roasted
and
raw
at
the
same
time
and
then
we
crept
into
our
hut
and
made
one
of
these
wretched
repasts
in
which
the
collops
of
food
slip
down
and
get
sat
upon
in
which
the
salt
is
blown
away
and
the
bread
saturated
in
beer
in
which
one
gnaws
one
food
as
adam
probably
did
but
as
men
need
not
do
now
far
removed
as
they
are
from
adam
discomforts
a
man
may
cheerfully
go
without
his
dinner
and
feed
like
a
beast
when
he
gains
anything
by
it
but
when
he
gains
nothing
and
has
his
boots
scorched
off
his
feet
into
the
bargain
it
is
hard
then
for
him
to
be
cheerful
i
was
bound
to
be
jolly
as
my
companion
had
come
there
merely
for
my
sake
but
how
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
not
become
sulky
that
was
the
miracle
as
it
was
i
know
full
well
that
he
wished
me
safe
in
england
having
looked
to
our
fire
and
smoked
a
sad
cigar
we
put
ourselves
to
bed
in
our
hut
the
operation
consisted
in
huddling
on
all
the
clothes
we
had
but
even
with
this
the
cold
prevented
us
from
sleeping
the
chill
damp
air
penetrated
through
two
shirts
two
coats
two
pairs
of
trousers
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
we
were
in
the
tropics
and
then
the
men
got
drunk
and
refused
to
cut
more
firewood
and
disputes
began
which
lasted
all
night
and
all
was
cold
damp
comfortless
wretched
and
endless
and
so
the
morning
came
that
it
was
morning
our
watches
told
us
and
also
a
dull
dawning
of
muddy
light
through
the
constant
mist
but
as
for
sunrise
the
sun
may
rise
for
those
who
get
up
decently
from
their
beds
in
the
plains
below
but
there
is
no
sunrising
on
helvellyn
or
righi
or
the
blue
mountain
peak
nothing
rises
there
but
mists
and
clouds
are
for
ever
falling
and
then
we
packed
up
our
wretched
traps
and
again
descended
while
coming
up
some
quips
and
cranks
had
passed
between
us
and
our
sable
followers
but
now
all
was
silent
as
grim
death
we
were
thinking
of
our
sore
hands
and
bruised
feet
were
mindful
of
the
dirt
which
clogged
us
and
the
damp
which
enveloped
us
were
mindful
also
a
little
of
our
spoilt
raiment
and
labours
our
wit
did
not
flow
freely
as
we
descended
a
second
breakfast
with
the
man
of
the
mountain
and
a
glorious
bath
in
a
huge
tank
somewhat
restored
us
and
as
we
regained
our
horses
the
miseries
of
our
expedition
were
over
my
friend
fervently
and
loudly
declared
that
no
spirit
of
hospitality
no
courtesy
to
a
stranger
no
human
eloquence
should
again
tempt
him
to
ascend
the
blue
mountains
and
i
cordially
advised
him
to
keep
his
resolution
i
made
no
vows
aloud
but
i
may
here
protest
that
any
such
vows
were
unnecessary
i
afterwards
visited
another
seat
flamstead
which
as
regards
scenery
has
rival
claims
to
those
of
raymond
lodge
the
views
from
flamstead
were
certainly
very
beautiful
but
on
the
whole
i
preferred
my
first
love
chapter
iv
jamaica
black
men
to
an
englishman
who
has
never
lived
in
a
slave
country
or
in
a
country
in
which
slavery
once
prevailed
the
negro
population
is
of
course
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
west
indies
but
the
eye
soon
becomes
accustomed
to
the
black
skin
and
the
thick
lip
and
the
ear
to
the
broken
patois
which
is
the
nearest
approach
to
english
which
the
ordinary
negro
ever
makes
when
one
has
been
a
week
among
them
the
novelty
is
all
gone
it
is
only
by
an
exercise
of
memory
and
intellect
that
one
is
enabled
to
think
of
them
as
a
strange
race
but
how
strange
is
the
race
of
creole
negroes
of
negroes
that
is
born
out
of
africa
they
have
no
country
of
their
own
yet
have
they
not
hitherto
any
country
of
their
adoption
for
whether
as
slaves
in
cuba
or
as
free
labourers
in
the
british
isles
they
are
in
each
case
a
servile
people
in
a
foreign
land
they
have
no
language
of
their
own
nor
have
they
as
yet
any
language
of
their
adoption
for
they
speak
their
broken
english
as
uneducated
foreigners
always
speak
a
foreign
language
they
have
no
idea
of
country
and
no
pride
of
race
for
even
among
themselves
the
word
nigger
conveys
their
worst
term
of
reproach
they
have
no
religion
of
their
own
and
can
hardly
as
yet
be
said
to
have
as
a
people
a
religion
by
adoption
and
yet
there
is
no
race
which
has
more
strongly
developed
its
own
physical
aptitudes
and
inaptitudes
its
own
habits
its
own
tastes
and
its
own
faults
the
west
indian
negro
knows
nothing
of
africa
except
that
it
is
a
term
of
reproach
if
african
immigrants
are
put
to
work
on
the
same
estate
with
him
he
will
not
eat
with
them
or
drink
with
them
or
walk
with
them
he
will
hardly
work
beside
them
and
regards
himself
as
a
creature
immeasurably
the
superior
of
the
new
comer
but
yet
he
has
made
no
approach
to
the
civilization
of
his
white
whom
he
imitates
as
a
monkey
does
a
man
physically
he
is
capable
of
the
hardest
bodily
work
and
that
probably
with
less
bodily
pain
than
men
of
any
other
race
but
he
is
idle
unambitious
as
to
worldly
position
sensual
and
content
with
little
intellectually
he
is
apparently
capable
of
but
little
sustained
effort
but
singularly
enough
here
he
is
ambitious
he
burns
to
be
regarded
as
a
scholar
puzzles
himself
with
fine
words
addicts
himself
to
religion
for
the
sake
of
appearance
and
delights
in
aping
the
little
graces
of
civilization
he
despises
himself
thoroughly
and
would
probably
be
content
to
starve
for
a
month
if
he
could
appear
as
a
white
man
for
a
day
but
yet
he
delights
in
signs
of
respect
paid
to
him
black
man
as
he
is
and
is
always
thinking
of
his
own
dignity
if
you
want
to
win
his
heart
for
an
hour
call
him
a
gentleman
but
if
you
want
to
reduce
him
to
a
despairing
obedience
tell
him
that
he
is
a
filthy
nigger
assure
him
that
his
father
and
mother
had
tails
like
monkeys
and
forbid
him
to
think
that
he
can
have
a
soul
like
a
white
man
among
the
west
indies
one
may
frequently
see
either
course
adopted
towards
them
by
their
unreasoning
ascendant
masters
i
do
not
think
that
education
has
as
yet
done
much
for
the
black
man
in
the
western
world
he
can
always
observe
and
often
read
but
he
can
seldom
reason
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
he
is
absolutely
without
mental
power
as
a
calf
is
he
does
draw
conclusions
but
he
carries
them
only
a
short
way
i
think
that
he
seldom
understands
the
purpose
of
industry
the
object
of
truth
or
the
results
of
honesty
he
is
not
always
idle
perhaps
not
always
false
certainly
not
always
a
thief
but
his
motives
are
the
fear
of
immediate
punishment
or
hopes
of
immediate
reward
he
fears
that
and
hopes
that
only
certain
virtues
he
copies
because
they
are
the
virtues
of
a
white
man
the
white
man
is
the
god
present
to
his
eye
and
he
believes
in
him
believes
in
him
with
a
qualified
faith
and
imitates
him
with
a
qualified
constancy
and
thus
i
am
led
to
say
and
i
say
it
with
sorrow
enough
that
i
distrust
the
negro
religion
what
i
mean
is
this
that
in
my
opinion
they
rarely
take
in
and
digest
the
great
and
simple
doctrines
of
christianity
that
they
should
love
and
fear
the
lord
their
god
and
love
their
neighbours
as
themselves
those
who
differ
from
me
and
the
number
will
comprise
the
whole
clergy
of
these
western
realms
and
very
many
beside
the
clergy
will
ask
among
other
questions
whether
these
simple
doctrines
are
obeyed
in
england
much
better
than
they
are
in
jamaica
i
would
reply
that
i
am
not
speaking
of
obedience
the
opinion
which
i
venture
to
give
is
that
the
very
first
meaning
of
the
terms
does
not
often
reach
the
negro
mind
not
even
the
minds
of
those
among
them
who
are
enthusiastically
religious
to
them
religious
exercises
are
in
themselves
the
good
thing
desirable
they
sing
their
psalms
and
believe
probably
that
good
will
result
but
they
do
not
connect
their
psalms
with
the
practice
of
any
virtue
they
say
their
prayers
but
having
said
them
have
no
idea
that
they
should
therefore
forgive
offences
they
hear
the
commandments
and
delight
in
the
responses
but
those
commandments
are
not
in
their
hearts
connected
with
abstinence
from
adultery
or
calumny
they
delight
to
go
to
church
or
meeting
they
are
energetic
in
singing
psalms
they
are
constant
in
the
responses
and
which
is
saying
much
more
for
them
they
are
wonderfully
expert
at
scripture
texts
but
and
i
say
it
with
grief
of
heart
and
with
much
trembling
also
at
the
reproaches
which
i
shall
have
to
endure
i
doubt
whether
religion
does
often
reach
their
minds
as
i
greatly
fear
being
misunderstood
on
this
subject
i
must
explain
that
i
by
no
means
think
that
religious
teaching
has
been
inoperative
for
good
among
the
negroes
were
i
to
express
such
an
opinion
i
should
be
putting
them
on
the
same
footing
with
the
slaves
in
cuba
who
are
left
wholly
without
such
teaching
and
who
in
consequence
are
much
nearer
the
brute
creation
than
their
more
fortunate
brethren
to
have
learnt
the
precepts
of
christianity
even
though
they
be
not
learnt
faithfully
softens
the
heart
and
expels
its
ferocity
that
theft
is
esteemed
a
sin
that
men
and
women
should
live
together
under
certain
laws
that
blood
should
not
be
shed
in
anger
that
an
oath
should
be
true
that
there
is
one
god
the
father
who
made
us
and
one
redeemer
who
would
willingly
save
us
these
doctrines
the
negro
in
a
general
way
has
learnt
and
in
them
he
has
a
sort
of
belief
he
has
so
far
progressed
that
by
them
he
judges
of
the
conduct
of
others
what
he
lacks
is
a
connecting
link
between
these
doctrines
and
himself
an
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
these
doctrines
are
intended
for
his
own
guidance
but
though
he
himself
wants
the
link
circumstances
have
in
some
measure
produced
it
as
he
judges
others
so
he
fears
the
judgment
of
others
and
in
this
manner
christianity
has
prevailed
with
him
in
many
respects
the
negro
phase
of
humanity
differs
much
from
that
which
is
common
to
us
and
which
has
been
produced
by
our
admixture
of
blood
and
our
present
extent
of
civilization
they
are
more
passionate
than
the
white
men
but
rarely
vindictive
as
we
are
the
smallest
injury
excites
their
eager
wrath
but
no
injury
produces
sustained
hatred
in
the
same
way
they
are
seldom
grateful
though
often
very
thankful
they
are
covetous
of
notice
as
is
a
child
or
a
dog
but
they
have
little
idea
of
earning
continual
respect
they
best
love
him
who
is
most
unlike
themselves
and
they
despise
the
coloured
man
who
approaches
them
in
breed
when
they
have
once
recognized
a
man
as
their
master
they
will
be
faithful
to
him
but
the
more
they
fear
that
master
the
more
they
will
respect
him
they
have
no
care
for
but
they
delight
in
being
gaudy
for
their
crimes
are
those
of
momentary
impulse
as
are
also
their
virtues
they
fear
death
but
if
they
can
lie
in
the
sun
without
pain
for
the
hour
they
will
hardly
drag
themselves
to
the
hospital
though
their
disease
be
mortal
they
love
their
offspring
but
in
their
rage
will
ill
use
them
fearfully
they
are
proud
of
them
when
they
are
praised
but
will
sell
their
daughter
virtue
for
a
dollar
they
are
greedy
of
food
but
generally
indifferent
as
to
its
quality
they
rejoice
in
finery
and
have
in
many
cases
begun
to
understand
the
benefit
of
comparative
cleanliness
but
they
are
rarely
tidy
a
little
makes
them
happy
and
nothing
makes
them
permanently
wretched
on
the
whole
they
laugh
and
sing
and
sleep
through
life
and
if
life
were
all
they
would
not
have
so
bad
a
time
of
it
these
i
think
are
the
qualities
of
the
negro
many
of
them
are
in
their
way
good
but
are
they
not
such
as
we
have
generally
seen
in
the
lower
spheres
of
life
much
of
this
is
strongly
opposed
to
the
idea
of
the
creole
negro
which
has
lately
become
prevalent
in
england
he
has
been
praised
for
his
piety
and
especially
praised
for
his
consistent
gratitude
to
his
benefactors
and
faithful
adherence
to
his
master
interests
on
such
subjects
our
greatest
difficulty
is
perhaps
that
of
avoiding
an
opinion
formed
by
exceptional
cases
that
there
are
and
have
been
pious
negroes
i
do
not
doubt
that
many
are
strongly
tinctured
with
the
language
and
outward
bearing
of
piety
i
am
well
aware
i
know
that
they
love
the
bible
love
it
as
the
roman
catholic
girl
loves
the
doll
of
a
madonna
which
she
dresses
with
muslin
and
ribbons
in
a
certain
sense
this
is
piety
and
such
piety
they
often
possess
and
i
do
not
deny
their
family
attachments
but
it
is
the
attachment
of
a
dog
we
have
all
had
dogs
whom
we
have
well
used
and
have
prided
ourselves
on
their
fidelity
we
have
seen
them
to
be
wretched
when
they
lose
us
for
a
moment
and
have
smiled
at
their
joy
when
they
again
discover
us
we
have
noted
their
patience
as
they
wait
for
food
from
the
hand
they
know
will
feed
them
we
have
seen
with
delight
how
their
love
for
us
glistens
in
their
eyes
we
trust
them
with
our
children
as
the
safest
playmates
and
teach
them
in
mocking
sport
the
tricks
of
humanity
in
return
for
this
the
dear
brutes
give
us
all
their
hearts
but
it
is
not
given
in
gratitude
and
they
abstain
with
all
their
power
from
injury
and
offence
but
they
do
not
abstain
from
judgment
let
his
master
ill
use
his
dog
ever
so
cruelly
yet
the
animal
has
no
anger
against
him
when
the
pain
is
over
let
a
stranger
save
him
from
such
ill
usage
and
he
has
no
thankfulness
after
the
moment
affection
and
fidelity
are
things
of
custom
with
him
i
know
how
deep
will
be
the
indignation
i
shall
draw
upon
my
head
by
this
picture
of
a
and
a
philanthropy
would
wish
to
look
on
all
men
as
walking
in
a
quick
path
towards
the
perfection
of
civilization
and
men
are
not
happy
in
their
good
efforts
unless
they
themselves
can
see
their
effects
they
are
not
content
to
fight
for
the
of
a
race
and
to
think
that
the
victory
shall
not
come
till
the
victors
shall
for
centuries
have
been
mingled
with
the
dust
the
friend
of
the
negro
when
he
puts
his
shoulder
to
the
wheel
and
tries
to
rescue
his
black
brother
from
the
degradation
of
an
inferior
species
hopes
to
see
his
client
rise
up
at
once
with
all
the
glories
of
civilization
round
his
head
there
behold
my
work
how
good
it
is
that
is
the
reward
to
which
he
looks
but
what
if
the
work
be
not
as
yet
good
what
if
it
be
god
pleasure
that
more
time
be
required
before
the
work
be
good
good
in
our
finite
sense
of
the
word
in
our
sense
which
requires
the
show
of
an
immediate
effect
after
all
what
we
should
desire
first
and
chiefly
is
it
not
the
truth
it
will
avail
nothing
to
humanity
to
call
a
man
a
civilized
christian
if
the
name
be
not
deserved
philanthropy
will
gain
little
but
and
gratification
of
its
vanity
by
applying
to
those
whom
it
would
serve
a
euphemistic
but
false
nomenclature
god
for
his
own
purposes
purposes
which
are
already
becoming
more
and
more
intelligible
to
his
creatures
has
created
men
of
inferior
and
superior
race
individually
the
state
of
an
esquimaux
is
grievous
to
an
educated
mind
but
the
educated
man
taking
the
world
collectively
knows
that
it
is
good
that
the
esquimaux
should
be
should
have
been
made
such
as
he
is
knows
also
that
that
state
admits
of
improvement
but
should
know
also
that
such
can
not
be
done
by
the
stroke
of
a
wand
by
a
speech
in
exeter
hall
by
the
mere
sounds
of
gospel
truth
beautiful
as
those
sounds
are
we
are
always
in
such
a
hurry
although
as
regards
the
progress
of
races
history
so
plainly
tells
us
how
vain
such
hurry
is
at
thirty
a
man
devotes
himself
to
proselytizing
a
people
and
if
the
people
be
not
proselytized
when
he
has
reached
forty
he
retires
in
disgust
in
early
life
we
have
aspirations
for
the
freedom
of
an
nation
but
in
middle
life
we
abandon
our
protégé
to
tyranny
and
the
infernal
gods
the
process
has
been
too
long
the
nation
should
have
arisen
free
at
once
upon
the
instant
it
is
hard
for
man
to
work
without
hope
of
seeing
that
for
which
he
labours
but
to
return
to
our
sable
friends
the
first
desire
of
a
man
in
a
state
of
civilization
is
for
property
greed
and
covetousness
are
no
doubt
vices
but
they
are
the
vices
which
have
grown
from
cognate
virtues
without
a
desire
for
property
man
could
make
no
progress
but
the
negro
has
no
such
desire
no
desire
strong
enough
to
induce
him
to
labour
for
that
which
he
wants
in
order
that
he
may
eat
and
be
clothed
he
will
work
a
little
as
for
anything
beyond
that
he
is
content
to
lie
in
the
sun
emancipation
and
the
last
change
in
the
sugar
duties
have
made
land
only
too
plentiful
in
jamaica
and
enormous
tracts
have
been
thrown
out
of
cultivation
as
unprofitable
and
it
is
also
only
too
fertile
the
negro
consequently
has
had
unbounded
facility
of
squatting
and
has
availed
himself
of
it
freely
to
recede
from
civilization
and
become
again
savage
as
savage
as
the
laws
of
the
community
will
permit
has
been
to
his
taste
i
believe
that
he
would
altogether
retrograde
if
left
to
himself
i
shall
now
be
asked
having
said
so
much
whether
i
think
that
emancipation
was
wrong
by
no
means
i
think
that
emancipation
was
clearly
right
but
i
think
that
we
expected
far
too
great
and
far
too
quick
a
result
from
emancipation
these
people
are
a
servile
race
fitted
by
nature
for
the
hardest
physical
work
and
apparently
at
present
fitted
for
little
else
some
thirty
years
since
they
were
in
a
state
when
such
work
was
their
lot
but
their
tasks
were
exacted
from
them
in
a
condition
of
bondage
abhorrent
to
the
feelings
of
the
age
and
opposed
to
the
religion
which
we
practised
for
us
thinking
as
we
did
slavery
was
a
sin
from
that
sin
we
have
cleansed
ourselves
but
the
mere
fact
of
doing
so
has
not
freed
us
from
our
difficulties
nor
was
it
to
be
expected
that
it
should
the
discontinuance
of
a
sin
is
always
the
commencement
of
a
struggle
few
probably
will
think
that
providence
has
permitted
so
great
an
exodus
as
that
which
has
taken
place
from
africa
to
the
west
without
having
wise
results
in
view
we
may
fairly
believe
that
it
has
been
a
part
of
the
creator
scheme
for
the
population
and
cultivation
of
the
earth
a
part
of
that
scheme
which
sent
asiatic
hordes
into
europe
and
formed
by
the
admixture
of
nations
that
race
to
which
it
is
our
pride
to
belong
but
that
admixture
of
blood
has
taken
tens
of
centuries
why
should
we
think
that
providence
should
work
more
rapidly
now
in
these
latter
ages
no
englishman
no
could
be
what
he
now
is
but
for
that
portion
of
wild
and
savage
energy
which
has
come
to
him
from
his
vandal
forefathers
may
it
not
then
be
fair
to
suppose
that
a
time
shall
come
when
a
race
will
inhabit
those
lovely
islands
fitted
by
nature
for
their
burning
sun
in
whose
blood
shall
be
mixed
some
portion
of
northern
energy
and
which
shall
owe
its
physical
powers
to
african
progenitors
a
race
that
shall
be
no
more
ashamed
of
the
name
of
negro
than
we
are
of
the
name
of
saxon
but
in
the
mean
time
what
are
we
to
do
with
our
friend
lying
as
he
now
is
at
his
ease
under
the
and
declining
to
work
after
ten
in
the
morning
no
tankee
massa
me
tired
now
me
no
want
more
money
or
perhaps
it
is
no
workee
no
more
money
no
workee
no
pay
these
are
the
answers
which
the
suppliant
planter
receives
when
at
ten
he
begs
his
negro
neighbours
to
go
a
second
time
into
the
and
earn
a
second
shilling
or
implores
them
to
work
for
him
more
than
four
days
a
week
or
solicits
them
at
to
put
up
with
a
short
ten
days
holiday
his
canes
are
ripe
and
his
mill
should
be
about
or
else
they
are
foul
with
weeds
and
the
hogsheads
will
be
very
short
if
they
be
not
cleansed
he
is
anxious
enough
for
all
his
world
depends
upon
it
but
what
does
the
negro
care
no
me
no
more
workee
now
the
busher
overseer
elide
the
o
and
change
v
into
b
and
the
word
will
gradually
explain
itself
the
busher
who
remembers
slavery
and
former
happy
days
d
s
him
for
a
lazy
nigger
and
threatens
him
with
coming
starvation
and
perhaps
with
returning
monkeydom
no
massa
no
starve
now
god
send
plenty
yam
no
more
monkey
now
massa
the
black
man
is
not
in
the
least
angry
though
the
busher
is
and
as
for
the
canes
they
remain
covered
with
dirt
and
the
return
of
the
estate
is
but
one
hundred
and
thirty
hogsheads
instead
of
one
hundred
and
ninety
let
the
english
farmer
think
of
that
and
in
realizing
the
full
story
he
must
imagine
that
the
plenteous
food
alluded
to
has
been
grown
on
his
own
ground
and
probably
planted
at
his
own
expense
the
busher
was
wrong
to
curse
the
man
and
wrong
to
threaten
him
with
the
monkey
tail
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
position
is
trying
to
the
temper
and
who
can
blame
the
black
man
he
is
free
to
work
or
free
to
let
it
alone
he
can
live
without
work
and
roll
in
the
sun
and
suck
oranges
and
eat
ay
and
ride
a
horse
perhaps
and
wear
a
white
waistcoat
and
plaited
shirt
on
sundays
why
should
he
care
for
the
busher
i
will
not
dig
for
half
a
crown
a
day
and
why
should
i
expect
him
to
do
so
i
can
live
without
it
so
can
he
but
nevertheless
it
would
be
very
well
if
we
could
so
contrive
that
he
should
not
live
without
work
it
is
clearly
not
nature
intention
that
he
should
be
exempted
from
the
general
lot
of
adam
children
we
would
not
have
our
friend
a
slave
but
we
would
fain
force
him
to
give
the
world
a
fair
day
work
for
his
fair
day
provender
if
we
knew
how
to
do
so
without
making
him
a
slave
the
fact
i
take
it
is
that
there
are
too
many
good
things
in
jamaica
for
the
number
who
have
to
enjoy
them
if
the
competitors
were
more
in
number
more
trouble
would
be
necessary
in
their
acquirement
and
now
just
at
this
moment
philanthropy
is
again
busy
in
england
protecting
the
jamaica
negro
he
is
a
man
and
a
brother
and
shall
we
not
regard
him
certainly
my
philanthropic
friend
let
us
regard
him
well
he
a
man
and
if
you
will
a
brother
but
he
is
the
very
idlest
brother
with
which
a
hardworking
workman
was
ever
cursed
intent
only
on
getting
his
mess
of
pottage
without
giving
anything
in
return
his
petitions
about
the
labour
market
my
friend
and
his
desire
to
be
protected
from
undue
competition
are
oh
my
friend
i
can
not
tell
you
how
utterly
they
are
gammon
he
is
now
eating
his
yam
without
work
and
in
that
privilege
he
is
anxious
to
be
maintained
and
you
are
you
willing
to
assist
him
in
his
views
the
negro
slave
was
ill
treated
ill
treated
at
any
rate
in
that
he
was
a
slave
and
therefore
by
that
reaction
which
prevails
in
all
human
matters
it
is
now
thought
necessary
to
wrap
him
up
in
cotton
and
put
him
under
a
glass
case
the
wind
must
not
blow
on
him
too
roughly
and
the
on
which
he
sleeps
should
not
be
ruffled
he
has
been
a
slave
therefore
now
let
him
be
a
sybarite
his
father
did
an
ample
share
of
work
therefore
let
the
son
be
made
free
from
his
portion
in
the
primeval
curse
the
friends
of
the
negro
if
they
do
not
actually
use
such
arguments
endeavour
to
carry
out
such
a
theory
but
one
feels
that
the
joke
has
almost
been
carried
too
far
when
one
is
told
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
labour
market
in
jamaica
and
save
the
negro
from
the
dangers
of
competition
no
immigration
of
labourers
into
that
happy
country
should
be
allowed
lest
the
rate
of
wages
be
lowered
and
the
unfortunate
labourer
be
made
more
dependent
on
his
master
but
if
the
unfortunate
labourers
could
be
made
to
work
say
four
days
a
week
and
on
an
average
eight
hours
a
day
would
not
that
in
itself
be
an
advantage
in
our
happy
england
men
are
not
slaves
but
the
competition
of
the
labour
market
forces
upon
them
long
days
of
continual
labour
in
our
own
country
ten
hours
of
toil
repeated
six
days
a
week
for
the
majority
of
us
will
barely
produce
the
necessaries
of
life
it
is
quite
right
that
we
should
love
the
negroes
but
i
can
not
understand
that
we
ought
to
love
them
better
than
ourselves
but
with
the
most
sensible
of
those
who
are
now
endeavouring
to
prevent
immigration
into
jamaica
the
argument
has
been
not
the
protection
of
the
jamaica
negro
but
the
probability
of
ill
usage
to
the
immigrating
african
in
the
first
place
it
is
impossible
not
to
observe
the
absurdity
of
acting
on
petitions
from
the
negroes
of
jamaica
on
such
a
pretence
as
this
does
any
one
truly
imagine
that
the
black
men
in
jamaica
are
so
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
their
cousins
in
africa
that
they
feel
themselves
bound
to
come
forward
and
express
their
anxiety
to
the
english
houses
of
parliament
of
course
nobody
believes
it
of
course
it
is
perfectly
understood
that
those
petitions
are
got
up
by
far
other
persons
and
with
by
far
other
views
and
that
not
one
negro
in
fifty
of
those
who
sign
them
understands
anything
whatever
about
the
matter
or
has
any
wish
or
any
solicitude
on
such
a
subject
lord
brougham
mentions
it
as
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
signatures
should
be
written
by
the
subscribers
themselves
that
there
should
be
so
few
marksmen
but
is
it
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
this
power
of
signing
their
names
should
be
used
for
so
false
a
purpose
and
then
comes
the
question
as
to
these
immigrants
themselves
though
it
is
not
natural
to
suppose
that
their
future
in
jamaica
should
be
very
anxious
about
them
such
anxiety
on
the
part
of
others
is
natural
in
the
first
place
it
is
for
the
government
to
look
to
them
and
then
lest
the
government
should
neglect
its
duty
it
is
for
such
men
as
lord
brougham
to
look
to
the
government
that
lord
brougham
should
to
the
last
be
anxious
for
the
welfare
of
the
african
is
what
all
men
would
expect
and
all
desire
but
we
would
not
wish
to
confide
even
to
him
the
power
of
absolutely
consummating
the
ruin
of
the
jamaica
planter
is
it
the
fact
that
labourers
immigrating
to
the
west
indies
have
been
ill
treated
whether
they
be
portuguese
from
madeira
coolies
from
india
africans
from
the
western
coast
or
chinese
in
jamaica
unfortunately
their
number
is
as
yet
but
scanty
but
in
british
guiana
they
are
numerous
i
think
i
may
venture
to
say
that
no
labourers
in
any
country
are
so
cared
for
so
closely
protected
so
certainly
saved
from
the
usual
wants
and
sorrows
incident
to
the
labouring
classes
and
this
is
equally
so
in
jamaica
as
far
as
the
system
has
gone
what
would
be
the
usage
of
the
african
introduced
by
voluntary
contribution
may
be
seen
in
the
usage
of
him
who
has
been
brought
into
the
country
from
captured
their
clothing
their
food
their
house
accommodation
their
hospital
treatment
their
amount
of
work
and
obligatory
period
of
working
with
one
master
all
these
matters
are
under
government
surveillance
and
the
planter
who
has
allotted
to
him
the
privilege
of
employing
such
labour
becomes
almost
as
much
subject
to
government
inspection
as
though
his
estate
were
government
property
it
is
said
that
an
obligatory
period
of
labour
amounts
to
slavery
even
though
the
contract
shall
have
been
entered
into
by
the
labourer
of
his
own
free
will
i
will
not
take
on
myself
to
deny
this
as
i
might
find
it
difficult
to
define
the
term
slavery
but
if
this
be
so
english
apprentices
are
slaves
and
so
are
indentured
clerks
so
are
hired
agricultural
servants
in
many
parts
of
england
and
wales
and
so
certainly
are
all
our
soldiers
and
sailors
but
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
slavery
that
acceptation
which
comes
home
to
us
all
whether
we
can
define
it
or
no
men
subject
to
such
contracts
are
not
slaves
there
is
much
that
is
prepossessing
in
the
ordinary
good
humour
of
the
negro
and
much
also
that
is
picturesque
in
his
tastes
i
soon
learned
to
think
the
women
pretty
in
spite
of
their
twisted
locks
of
wool
and
to
like
the
ring
of
their
laughter
though
it
is
not
exactly
they
are
very
rarely
surly
when
spoken
to
and
their
replies
though
they
seldom
are
absolutely
witty
contain
either
in
the
sound
or
in
the
sense
something
that
amounts
to
drollery
the
unpractised
ear
has
great
difficulty
in
understanding
them
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
this
indistinctness
has
created
the
fun
which
i
have
seemed
to
relish
the
tone
and
look
are
humorous
and
the
words
which
are
hardly
heard
and
are
not
understood
get
credit
for
humour
also
nothing
about
them
is
more
astonishing
than
the
dress
of
the
women
it
is
impossible
to
deny
to
them
considerable
taste
and
great
power
of
adaptation
in
england
among
our
housemaids
and
even
haymakers
crinoline
false
flowers
long
waists
and
flowing
sleeves
have
become
common
but
they
do
not
wear
their
finery
as
though
they
were
at
home
in
it
there
is
generally
with
them
when
in
their
sunday
best
something
of
the
hog
in
armour
with
the
negro
woman
there
is
nothing
of
this
in
the
first
place
she
is
never
then
she
has
very
frequently
a
good
figure
and
having
it
she
knows
how
to
make
the
best
of
it
she
has
a
natural
skill
in
dress
and
will
be
seen
with
a
boddice
fitted
to
her
as
though
it
had
been
made
and
laced
in
paris
their
costumes
on
fête
days
and
sundays
are
perfectly
marvellous
they
are
by
no
means
contented
with
coloured
calicoes
but
shine
in
muslin
and
light
silks
at
heaven
only
knows
how
much
a
yard
they
wear
their
dresses
of
an
enormous
fulness
one
may
see
of
a
sunday
evening
three
ladies
occupying
a
whole
street
by
the
breadth
of
their
garments
who
on
the
preceding
day
were
scrubbing
pots
and
carrying
weights
about
the
town
on
their
heads
and
they
will
walk
in
too
as
though
they
had
been
used
to
go
in
such
attire
from
their
youth
up
they
rejoice
most
in
white
in
white
muslin
with
coloured
sashes
in
boots
pink
gloves
parasols
and
straw
hats
with
deep
veils
and
glittering
bugles
the
hat
and
the
veil
however
are
mistakes
if
the
negro
woman
thoroughly
understood
effect
she
would
wear
no
but
the
coloured
handkerchief
which
is
hers
by
right
of
national
custom
some
of
their
efforts
after
dignity
of
costume
are
ineffably
ludicrous
one
sunday
evening
far
away
in
the
country
as
i
was
riding
with
a
gentleman
the
proprietor
of
the
estate
around
us
i
saw
a
young
girl
walking
home
from
church
she
was
arrayed
from
head
to
foot
in
virgin
white
her
gloves
were
on
and
her
parasol
was
up
her
hat
also
was
white
and
so
was
the
lace
and
so
were
the
bugles
which
adorned
it
she
walked
with
a
stately
dignity
that
was
worthy
of
such
a
costume
and
worthy
also
of
higher
grandeur
for
behind
her
walked
an
attendant
nymph
carrying
the
beauty
on
her
head
a
negro
woman
carries
every
burden
on
her
head
from
a
tub
of
water
weighing
a
hundredweight
down
to
a
bottle
of
physic
when
we
came
up
to
her
she
turned
towards
us
and
curtsied
she
curtsied
for
she
recognized
her
but
she
curtsied
with
great
dignity
for
she
recognized
also
her
own
finery
the
girl
behind
with
the
made
the
ordinary
obeisance
crooking
her
leg
up
at
the
knee
and
then
standing
upright
quicker
than
thought
who
on
earth
is
that
princess
said
i
they
are
two
sisters
who
both
work
at
my
mill
said
my
friend
next
sunday
they
will
change
places
polly
will
have
the
parasol
and
the
hat
and
jenny
will
carry
the
on
her
head
behind
her
i
was
in
a
shoemaker
shop
at
thomas
buying
a
pair
of
boots
when
a
negro
entered
quickly
and
in
a
loud
voice
said
he
wanted
a
pair
of
pumps
he
was
a
labouring
man
fresh
from
his
labour
he
had
on
an
old
hat
what
in
ireland
men
would
call
a
caubeen
he
was
in
his
and
was
barefooted
as
the
only
shopman
was
looking
for
my
boots
he
was
not
attended
to
at
the
moment
want
a
pair
of
pumps
directerly
he
roared
out
in
a
very
dictatorial
voice
sit
down
for
a
moment
said
the
shopman
and
i
will
attend
to
you
he
did
sit
down
but
did
so
in
the
oddest
fashion
he
dropped
himself
suddenly
into
a
chair
and
at
the
same
moment
rapidly
raised
his
legs
from
the
ground
and
as
he
did
so
fastened
his
hands
across
them
just
below
his
knees
so
as
to
keep
his
feet
suspended
from
his
arms
this
he
contrived
to
do
in
such
a
manner
that
the
moment
his
body
reached
the
chair
his
feet
left
the
ground
i
looked
on
in
amazement
thinking
he
was
mad
give
i
a
bit
of
carpet
he
screamed
out
still
holding
up
his
feet
but
with
much
difficulty
yes
yes
said
the
shopman
still
searching
for
the
boots
give
i
a
bit
of
carpet
directerly
he
again
exclaimed
the
seat
of
the
chair
was
very
narrow
and
the
back
was
straight
and
the
position
was
not
easy
as
my
reader
will
ascertain
if
he
attempt
it
he
was
with
anger
and
discomfort
the
shopman
gave
him
the
bit
of
carpet
most
men
and
women
will
remember
that
such
bits
of
carpet
are
common
in
shoemakers
shops
they
are
supplied
i
believe
in
order
that
they
who
are
delicate
should
not
soil
their
stockings
on
the
floor
the
gentleman
in
search
of
the
pumps
had
seen
that
people
of
dignity
were
supplied
with
such
luxuries
and
resolved
to
have
his
value
for
his
money
but
as
he
had
on
neither
shoes
nor
stockings
the
little
bit
of
carpet
was
hardly
necessary
for
his
material
comfort
chapter
jamaica
coloured
men
if
in
speaking
of
the
negroes
i
have
been
in
danger
of
offending
my
friends
at
home
i
shall
be
certain
in
speaking
of
the
coloured
men
to
offend
my
friends
in
jamaica
on
this
subject
though
i
have
sympathy
with
them
i
have
no
agreement
they
look
on
themselves
as
the
ascendant
race
i
look
upon
those
of
colour
as
being
so
or
at
any
rate
as
about
to
become
so
in
speaking
of
my
friends
in
jamaica
it
is
not
unnatural
that
i
should
allude
to
the
europeans
or
european
creoles
to
those
in
whose
veins
there
is
no
admixture
of
african
blood
similia
similibus
a
man
from
choice
will
live
with
those
who
are
of
his
own
habits
and
his
own
way
of
thinking
but
as
regards
jamaica
i
believe
that
the
light
of
their
star
is
waning
that
their
ascendency
is
over
in
short
that
their
work
if
not
done
is
on
the
decline
ascendency
is
a
disagreeable
word
to
apply
to
any
two
different
races
whose
fate
it
may
be
to
live
together
in
the
same
land
it
has
been
felt
to
be
so
in
ireland
when
used
either
with
reference
to
the
saxon
protestant
or
celtic
roman
catholic
and
it
is
so
with
reference
to
those
of
various
shades
of
colour
in
jamaica
but
nevertheless
it
is
the
true
word
when
two
rivers
come
together
the
waters
of
which
do
not
mix
the
one
stream
will
be
the
stronger
will
the
other
will
become
ascendant
and
so
it
is
with
people
and
nations
it
may
not
be
to
talk
about
ascendency
but
sometimes
pretty
speaking
will
not
answer
a
man
purpose
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
explain
that
by
coloured
men
i
mean
those
who
are
of
a
mixed
race
of
a
breed
mixed
be
it
in
what
proportion
it
may
between
the
white
european
and
the
black
african
speaking
of
jamaica
i
might
almost
say
between
the
and
the
african
for
there
remains
i
take
it
but
a
small
tinge
of
spanish
blood
of
the
old
indian
blood
there
is
i
imagine
hardly
a
vestige
both
the
white
men
and
the
black
dislike
their
coloured
neighbours
it
is
useless
to
deny
that
as
a
rule
such
is
the
case
the
white
men
now
at
this
very
day
dislike
them
more
in
jamaica
than
they
do
in
other
parts
of
the
west
indies
because
they
are
constantly
driven
to
meet
them
and
are
more
afraid
of
them
in
jamaica
one
does
come
in
contact
with
coloured
men
they
are
to
be
met
at
the
governor
table
they
sit
in
the
house
of
assembly
they
can
not
be
refused
admittance
to
state
parties
or
even
to
large
assemblies
they
have
forced
themselves
forward
and
must
be
recognized
as
being
in
the
van
individuals
decry
them
will
not
have
them
within
their
doors
affect
to
despise
them
but
in
effect
the
coloured
men
of
jamaica
can
not
be
despised
much
longer
it
will
be
said
that
we
have
been
wrong
if
we
have
ever
despised
these
coloured
people
or
indeed
if
we
have
ever
despised
the
negroes
or
any
other
race
i
can
hardly
think
that
anything
so
natural
can
be
very
wrong
those
who
are
educated
and
civilized
and
powerful
will
always
in
one
sense
despise
those
who
are
not
and
the
most
educated
and
civilized
and
most
powerful
will
despise
those
who
are
less
so
euphuists
may
proclaim
against
such
a
doctrine
but
experience
i
think
teaches
us
that
it
is
true
if
the
coloured
people
in
the
west
indies
can
overtop
contempt
it
is
because
they
are
acquiring
education
civilization
and
power
in
jamaica
they
are
i
hope
in
a
way
to
do
this
my
theory
for
i
acknowledge
to
a
theory
is
this
that
providence
has
sent
white
men
and
black
men
to
these
regions
in
order
that
from
them
may
spring
a
race
fitted
by
intellect
for
civilization
and
fitted
also
by
physical
organization
for
tropical
labour
the
negro
in
his
primitive
state
is
not
i
think
fitted
for
the
former
and
the
european
white
creole
is
certainly
not
fitted
for
the
latter
to
all
such
rules
there
are
of
course
exceptions
in
porto
rico
for
instance
one
of
the
two
remaining
spanish
colonies
in
the
west
indies
the
peons
or
free
peasant
labourers
are
of
mixed
spanish
and
indian
blood
without
i
believe
any
negro
element
and
there
are
occasional
negroes
whose
mental
condition
would
certainly
tend
to
disprove
the
former
of
the
two
foregoing
propositions
were
it
not
that
in
such
matters
exceptional
cases
prove
and
disprove
nothing
englishmen
as
a
rule
are
stouter
than
frenchmen
were
a
french
falstaff
and
an
english
slender
brought
into
a
room
together
the
above
position
would
be
not
a
whit
disproved
it
is
probable
also
that
the
future
race
who
shall
inhabit
these
islands
may
have
other
elements
than
the
two
already
named
there
will
soon
be
here
in
the
teeth
of
our
friends
of
the
society
thousands
from
china
and
hindostan
the
chinese
and
the
coolies
immigrants
from
india
are
always
called
coolies
greatly
excel
the
negro
in
intelligence
and
partake
though
in
a
limited
degree
of
the
negro
physical
abilities
in
a
hot
climate
and
thus
the
blood
of
asia
will
be
mixed
with
that
of
africa
and
the
necessary
compound
will
by
god
infinite
wisdom
and
power
be
formed
for
these
latitudes
as
it
has
been
formed
for
the
colder
regions
in
which
the
preserves
his
energy
and
works
i
know
it
will
be
said
that
there
have
been
no
signs
of
a
mixture
of
breed
between
the
negro
and
the
coolie
and
the
negro
and
the
chinese
the
instances
hitherto
are
i
am
aware
but
rare
but
then
the
immigration
of
these
classes
is
as
yet
but
recent
and
custom
is
necessary
and
a
language
commonly
understood
and
habits
which
the
similitude
of
position
will
also
make
common
before
such
races
will
amalgamate
that
they
will
amalgamate
if
brought
together
all
history
teaches
us
the
and
the
negro
have
done
so
and
in
two
hundred
years
have
produced
a
population
which
is
said
to
amount
to
a
fifth
of
that
of
the
whole
island
of
jamaica
and
which
probably
amounts
to
much
more
two
hundred
years
with
us
is
a
long
time
but
it
is
not
so
in
the
world
history
from
to
is
a
vast
lapse
of
years
but
how
little
is
the
lapse
from
the
year
to
the
year
dating
from
the
creation
of
the
world
or
rather
how
small
appears
such
lapse
to
us
in
how
many
pages
is
its
history
written
and
yet
god
races
were
spreading
themselves
over
the
earth
then
as
now
men
are
in
such
a
hurry
they
can
hardly
believe
that
that
will
come
to
pass
of
which
they
have
evidence
that
it
will
not
come
to
pass
in
their
own
days
but
then
comes
the
question
whether
the
mulatto
is
more
capable
of
being
educated
than
the
negro
and
more
able
to
work
under
a
hot
sun
than
the
englishman
whether
he
does
not
rather
lose
the
physical
power
of
the
one
and
the
intellectual
power
of
the
other
there
are
those
in
jamaica
who
have
known
them
long
and
who
think
that
as
a
race
they
have
deteriorated
both
in
mind
and
body
i
am
not
prepared
to
deny
this
they
probably
have
deteriorated
in
mind
and
body
and
nevertheless
my
theory
may
be
right
nay
i
will
go
further
and
say
that
such
deterioration
on
both
sides
is
necessary
to
the
correctness
of
my
theory
in
what
compound
are
we
to
look
for
the
full
strength
of
each
component
part
should
punch
be
as
strong
as
brandy
or
as
sweet
as
sugar
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
in
order
to
be
good
and
efficient
punch
it
should
partake
duly
of
the
strength
of
the
spirit
and
of
the
sweetness
of
the
saccharine
according
to
the
skill
and
will
of
the
gnostic
fabricator
who
in
mixing
knows
his
own
purposes
so
has
it
even
been
also
in
the
admixture
of
races
the
same
amount
of
physical
power
is
not
required
for
all
climates
nor
the
same
amount
of
mental
energy
but
the
mulatto
though
he
has
deteriorated
from
the
black
man
in
one
respect
and
from
the
white
in
another
does
also
excel
the
black
man
in
one
respect
and
also
excel
the
white
in
another
as
a
rule
he
can
not
work
as
a
negro
can
he
could
not
probably
endure
to
labour
in
the
for
sixteen
hours
out
of
the
as
is
done
by
the
cuban
slave
but
he
can
work
safely
under
a
tropical
sun
and
can
in
the
day
go
through
a
fair
day
work
he
is
not
liable
to
yellow
fever
as
is
the
white
man
and
enjoys
as
valid
a
protection
from
the
effects
of
heat
as
the
heat
of
these
regions
requires
nor
as
far
as
we
yet
know
have
galileos
shakespeares
or
napoleons
been
produced
among
the
mulattos
few
may
probably
have
been
produced
who
are
able
even
to
form
an
accurate
judgment
as
to
the
genius
of
such
men
as
these
but
that
the
mulatto
race
partakes
largely
of
the
intelligence
and
ambition
of
their
white
forefathers
it
is
i
think
useless
and
moreover
wicked
to
deny
wicked
because
the
denial
arises
from
an
unjust
desire
to
close
against
them
the
door
of
promotion
let
any
stranger
go
through
the
shops
and
stores
of
kingston
and
see
how
many
of
them
are
either
owned
or
worked
by
men
of
colour
let
him
go
into
the
house
of
assembly
and
see
how
large
a
proportion
of
their
debates
is
carried
on
by
men
of
colour
i
do
think
much
of
the
parliamentary
excellence
of
these
debates
as
i
shall
have
to
explain
but
the
coloured
men
at
any
rate
hold
their
own
against
their
white
colleagues
how
large
a
portion
of
the
public
service
is
carried
on
by
them
how
well
they
thrive
though
the
prejudices
of
both
white
and
black
are
so
strong
against
them
i
just
now
spoke
of
these
coloured
men
as
mulattos
i
did
so
because
i
was
then
anxious
to
refer
to
the
exact
and
equal
division
of
black
and
white
blood
of
course
it
is
understood
that
the
mulatto
technically
so
called
is
the
child
of
parents
one
of
whom
is
all
white
and
the
other
all
black
and
to
judge
exactly
of
the
mixed
race
one
should
judge
probably
from
such
an
equal
division
but
no
such
distinction
can
be
effectually
maintained
in
speaking
or
even
in
thinking
of
these
people
the
various
gradations
of
coloured
blood
range
from
all
but
perfect
white
to
all
but
perfect
black
and
the
dispositions
and
capabilities
are
equally
various
in
the
lower
orders
among
those
who
are
nearest
to
the
african
stock
no
attempts
i
imagine
are
made
to
preserve
an
exact
line
one
is
at
first
inclined
to
think
that
the
slightest
infusion
of
white
blood
may
be
traced
in
the
complexion
and
hair
and
heard
in
the
voice
but
when
the
matter
is
closely
regarded
one
often
finds
it
difficult
to
express
an
opinion
even
to
oneself
colour
is
frequently
not
the
safest
guide
to
an
inquirer
really
endeavouring
to
separate
the
races
should
so
thankless
a
task
ever
be
attempted
the
speech
i
think
and
the
intelligence
would
afford
the
sources
of
information
on
which
most
reliance
could
be
placed
but
the
distinction
between
the
white
and
the
coloured
men
is
much
more
closely
looked
into
and
those
are
the
unfortunate
among
the
latter
who
are
tempted
by
the
closeness
of
their
relationship
to
europe
to
deny
their
african
parentage
many
do
if
not
by
lip
at
any
rate
by
deed
stoutly
make
such
denial
not
by
lip
for
the
subject
is
much
too
sore
for
speech
but
by
every
wile
by
which
a
white
quadroon
can
seek
to
deny
his
ancestry
such
denial
is
never
allowed
the
crisp
hair
the
sallow
skin
the
known
family
history
the
thick
lip
of
the
old
remembered
granddam
a
certain
languor
in
the
eye
all
or
some
or
perhaps
but
one
of
these
tells
the
tale
but
the
tale
is
told
and
the
is
made
always
and
always
in
vain
this
evil
for
it
is
an
evil
arises
mainly
from
the
white
jealousy
he
who
seeks
to
pass
for
other
than
he
is
makes
a
low
attempt
all
attempts
at
falsehood
must
of
necessity
be
low
but
i
doubt
whether
such
energy
of
repudiation
be
not
equally
low
why
not
allow
the
claim
or
seem
to
allow
it
if
practicable
white
art
thou
my
friend
be
a
white
man
if
thou
wilt
or
rather
if
thou
canst
all
we
require
of
thee
is
that
there
remains
no
negro
ignorance
no
negro
cunning
no
negro
apathy
of
brain
forbear
those
vain
attempts
to
wash
out
that
hair
of
thine
and
make
it
lank
and
damp
we
will
not
regard
at
all
that
little
wave
in
thy
locks
not
even
that
lisp
in
thy
tongue
but
struggle
my
friend
to
be
open
in
thy
speech
any
wave
there
we
can
not
but
regard
speak
out
the
thought
that
is
in
thee
for
if
thy
thoughts
lisp
negrowards
our
verdict
must
be
against
thee
is
it
not
thus
that
we
should
accept
their
little
efforts
but
we
do
not
accept
them
so
in
lieu
thereof
we
admit
no
claim
that
can
by
any
evidence
be
rejected
and
worse
than
that
we
impute
the
stigma
of
black
blood
where
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
such
imputation
a
nice
fellow
jones
eh
very
intelligent
and
well
mannered
some
stranger
says
who
knows
nothing
of
antecedents
yes
indeed
answers
smith
of
jamaica
a
very
decent
sort
of
fellow
they
do
say
that
he
coloured
of
course
you
know
that
the
next
time
you
see
jones
you
observe
him
closely
and
can
find
no
trace
of
the
ethiop
but
should
he
presently
descant
on
purity
of
blood
and
the
insupportable
impudence
of
the
coloured
people
then
and
not
till
then
you
would
begin
to
doubt
but
these
are
evils
which
beset
merely
the
point
of
juncture
between
the
two
races
with
of
those
of
mixed
breed
no
attempts
at
concealment
are
by
any
means
possible
and
by
them
of
course
no
such
attempts
are
made
they
take
their
lot
as
it
is
and
i
think
that
on
the
whole
they
make
the
most
of
it
they
of
course
are
jealous
of
the
assumed
ascendency
of
the
white
men
and
affect
to
show
sometimes
not
in
the
most
efficacious
manner
that
they
are
his
equal
in
external
graces
as
in
internal
capacities
they
are
imperious
to
the
black
men
and
determined
on
that
side
to
exhibit
and
use
their
superiority
at
this
we
can
hardly
be
surprised
if
we
can
not
set
them
a
better
lesson
than
we
do
we
can
hardly
expect
the
benefit
which
should
arise
from
better
teaching
but
the
great
point
to
be
settled
is
this
whether
this
race
of
mulattos
quadroons
mustes
and
what
not
are
capable
of
managing
matters
for
themselves
of
undertaking
the
higher
walks
of
life
of
living
in
short
as
an
independent
people
with
a
proper
share
of
masterdom
and
not
necessarily
as
a
servile
people
as
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
if
not
it
will
fare
badly
for
jamaica
and
will
probably
also
fare
badly
in
coming
years
for
the
rest
of
the
west
indies
whether
other
immigration
be
allowed
or
no
of
one
kind
of
immigration
the
supply
into
jamaica
is
becoming
less
and
less
few
european
white
men
now
turn
thither
in
quest
of
fortune
few
adventurers
now
seek
her
shores
as
the
future
home
of
their
adoption
the
white
man
has
been
there
and
has
left
his
mark
the
creole
children
of
these
europeans
of
course
remain
but
their
numbers
are
no
longer
increased
by
new
comers
but
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
are
fit
these
coloured
people
to
undertake
the
higher
as
well
as
lower
paths
of
human
labour
indeed
they
do
undertake
them
and
thrive
well
in
them
now
much
to
the
disgust
of
the
ascendant
class
they
do
make
money
and
enjoy
it
they
practise
as
statesmen
as
lawyers
and
as
doctors
in
the
colony
and
though
they
have
not
as
yet
shone
brightly
as
divines
in
our
english
church
such
deficiency
may
be
attributed
more
to
the
jealousy
of
the
parsons
of
that
church
than
to
their
own
incapacity
there
are
they
say
seventy
thousand
coloured
people
in
the
island
and
not
more
than
fifteen
thousand
white
people
as
the
former
increase
in
intelligence
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
they
will
submit
to
the
latter
nor
are
they
at
all
inclined
to
submission
but
they
have
still
an
battle
before
them
they
are
by
no
means
humble
in
their
gait
and
their
want
of
meekness
sets
their
white
neighbours
against
them
they
are
always
proclaiming
by
their
voice
and
look
that
they
are
as
good
as
the
white
man
but
they
are
always
showing
by
their
voice
and
look
also
that
they
know
that
this
is
a
false
boast
and
then
they
are
by
no
means
popular
with
the
negro
a
negro
as
a
rule
will
not
serve
a
mulatto
when
he
can
serve
a
european
or
a
white
creole
he
thinks
that
the
mulatto
is
too
near
akin
to
himself
to
be
worthy
of
any
respect
in
his
passion
he
calls
him
a
nigger
and
protests
that
he
is
not
and
never
will
be
like
buckra
man
the
negroes
complain
that
the
coloured
men
are
sly
and
cunning
that
they
can
not
be
trusted
as
masters
that
they
tyrannize
bully
and
deceive
in
short
that
they
have
their
own
negro
faults
there
may
doubtless
be
some
truth
in
this
they
have
still
a
portion
of
their
lesson
to
learn
perhaps
the
greater
portion
i
affirm
merely
that
the
lesson
is
being
learned
a
race
of
people
with
its
good
and
ill
qualities
is
not
formed
in
a
couple
of
centuries
and
if
it
be
fated
that
the
race
in
these
islands
is
to
yield
place
to
another
people
and
to
abandon
its
ground
having
done
its
appointed
work
surely
such
a
decree
should
be
no
cause
of
sorrow
to
have
done
their
appointed
work
and
done
it
well
should
not
this
be
enough
for
any
men
but
there
are
they
who
protest
that
such
ideas
as
these
with
reference
to
this
people
are
unpatriotic
are
unworthy
of
an
englishman
who
should
foster
the
ascendency
of
his
own
race
and
his
own
country
such
men
will
have
it
as
an
axiom
that
when
an
englishman
has
been
master
once
he
should
be
master
always
that
his
dominion
should
not
give
way
to
strange
hands
or
his
ascendency
yield
itself
to
strange
races
it
is
unpatriotic
forsooth
to
suggest
that
these
tawny
children
of
the
sun
should
get
the
better
of
their
british
lords
and
rule
the
roast
themselves
even
were
it
so
should
it
even
be
granted
that
such
an
idea
is
unpatriotic
one
would
then
be
driven
back
to
ask
whether
patriotism
be
a
virtue
it
is
at
any
rate
a
virtue
in
consequence
only
of
the
finite
aspirations
of
mankind
to
love
the
universe
which
god
has
made
were
man
capable
of
such
love
would
be
a
loftier
attribute
than
any
feeling
for
one
own
country
the
gentile
was
as
dear
as
the
jew
the
samaritans
as
much
prized
as
they
of
galilee
or
as
the
children
of
judah
the
present
position
and
prospects
of
the
children
of
great
britain
are
sufficiently
noble
and
sufficiently
extended
one
need
not
begrudge
to
others
their
limited
share
in
the
population
and
government
of
the
world
welfare
while
so
large
a
part
of
north
america
and
australia
remain
still
savage
waiting
the
white
foot
waiting
in
fact
for
the
foot
of
the
englishman
there
can
be
no
reason
why
we
should
doom
our
children
to
swelter
and
grow
pale
within
the
tropics
a
certain
work
has
been
ours
to
do
there
a
certain
amount
of
remaining
work
it
is
still
probably
our
lot
to
complete
but
when
that
is
done
when
civilization
commerce
and
education
shall
have
been
spread
when
sufficient
of
our
blood
shall
have
been
infused
into
the
veins
of
those
children
of
the
sun
then
i
think
we
may
be
ready
without
stain
to
our
patriotism
to
take
off
our
hats
and
bid
farewell
to
the
west
indies
and
be
it
remembered
that
i
am
here
speaking
of
the
general
ascendancy
not
of
the
political
power
of
these
coloured
races
it
may
be
that
after
all
we
shall
still
have
to
send
out
some
white
governor
with
a
white
and
a
white
private
secretary
some
three
or
four
unfortunate
white
men
to
support
the
dignity
of
the
throne
of
queen
victoria
grandchild
such
may
be
or
may
not
be
to
my
thinking
it
would
be
more
for
our
honour
that
it
should
not
be
so
if
the
honour
glory
and
of
the
child
be
dear
to
the
parents
great
britain
should
surely
be
more
proud
of
the
united
states
than
of
any
of
her
colonies
we
britishers
have
a
noble
mission
the
word
i
know
is
unpopular
for
it
has
been
foully
misused
but
it
is
in
itself
a
good
word
and
none
other
will
supply
its
place
we
have
a
noble
mission
but
we
are
never
content
with
it
it
is
not
enough
for
us
to
beget
nations
civilize
countries
and
instruct
in
truth
and
knowledge
the
dominant
races
of
the
coming
ages
all
this
will
not
suffice
unless
also
we
can
maintain
a
king
over
them
what
is
it
to
us
or
even
to
them
who
may
be
their
king
or
ruler
or
to
speak
with
a
nearer
approach
to
sense
from
what
source
they
be
governed
so
long
as
they
be
happy
prosperous
and
good
and
yet
there
are
men
mad
enough
to
regret
the
united
states
many
men
are
mad
enough
to
look
forward
with
anything
but
composure
to
the
inevitable
happily
inevitable
day
when
australia
shall
follow
in
the
same
path
we
have
risen
so
high
that
we
may
almost
boast
to
have
placed
ourselves
above
national
glory
the
welfare
of
the
coming
world
is
now
the
proper
care
of
the
race
the
coloured
people
i
have
said
have
made
their
way
into
society
in
jamaica
that
is
they
have
made
a
certain
degree
of
impression
on
the
millstone
which
will
therefore
soon
be
perforated
through
and
through
and
then
crumble
to
pieces
like
nay
they
have
been
or
are
judges
prime
ministers
leaders
of
the
opposition
and
what
not
the
men
have
so
far
made
their
way
the
difficulty
now
is
with
the
women
and
in
high
questions
of
society
here
is
always
the
all
manners
of
men
can
get
themselves
into
a
room
together
without
difficulty
and
can
behave
themselves
with
moderate
forbearance
to
each
other
when
in
it
but
there
are
points
on
which
ladies
are
harder
than
steel
stiffer
than
their
brocaded
silks
more
obdurate
than
whalebone
he
wishes
me
to
meet
a
lady
said
to
me
speaking
of
her
husband
because
is
a
very
respectable
good
sort
of
man
i
have
no
objection
whatever
to
but
if
i
begin
with
her
i
know
there
will
be
no
end
probably
not
i
said
when
you
once
commence
you
will
doubtless
have
to
go
on
in
the
good
path
i
confess
that
the
last
words
were
said
on
that
occasion
the
courage
was
wanting
in
me
to
speak
out
my
mind
the
lady
was
very
pretty
and
i
could
not
endure
to
be
among
the
unfavoured
ones
that
is
just
what
i
have
said
to
but
he
never
thinks
about
such
things
he
is
so
very
imprudent
if
i
ask
here
how
can
i
keep
out
they
are
both
very
respectable
no
doubt
but
what
were
their
grandmothers
ah
if
we
were
to
think
of
their
grandmothers
it
would
doubtless
be
a
dark
subject
but
what
o
lady
of
their
grandchildren
that
may
be
the
most
important
and
also
most
interesting
side
from
whence
to
view
the
family
these
people
marry
now
another
lady
said
to
me
a
lady
not
old
exactly
but
old
enough
to
allude
to
such
a
subject
and
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
i
thought
i
could
catch
an
idea
that
she
conceived
them
in
doing
so
to
be
trenching
on
the
privileges
of
their
superiors
but
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
never
thought
of
looking
to
that
at
all
are
we
to
associate
with
the
children
of
such
women
and
teach
our
daughters
that
vice
is
not
to
be
shunned
ah
dear
lady
not
old
but
sufficiently
old
this
statement
of
yours
is
only
too
true
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
did
not
think
much
of
matrimony
had
but
little
opportunity
of
thinking
much
of
it
but
with
whom
did
the
fault
chiefly
lie
these
very
people
of
whom
we
are
speaking
would
they
not
be
your
cousins
but
for
the
lack
of
matrimony
your
uncle
your
father
your
cousins
your
grandfather
nay
your
very
brother
are
they
not
the
true
criminals
in
this
matter
they
who
have
lived
in
this
unhallowed
state
with
women
of
a
lower
race
for
the
sinners
themselves
of
either
sex
i
would
not
ask
pardon
but
you
might
forgive
the
children
children
the
life
of
coloured
women
in
jamaica
some
years
since
was
certainly
too
often
immoral
they
themselves
were
frequently
illegitimate
and
they
were
not
unwilling
that
their
children
should
be
so
also
to
such
a
one
it
was
preferable
to
be
a
white
man
mistress
than
the
wife
of
such
as
herself
and
it
did
not
bring
on
them
the
same
disgrace
this
kind
of
life
as
it
does
on
women
in
england
or
even
i
may
say
on
women
in
europe
nor
the
same
bitter
punishment
their
master
though
he
might
be
stern
enough
and
a
tyrant
as
the
owner
of
slaves
living
on
his
own
little
principality
might
probably
be
was
kinder
to
her
than
to
the
other
females
around
her
and
in
a
rough
sort
of
way
was
true
to
her
he
did
not
turn
her
out
of
the
house
and
she
found
it
to
be
promotion
to
be
the
mother
of
his
children
and
the
upper
servant
in
his
establishment
and
in
those
days
days
still
so
near
to
us
the
coloured
woman
was
a
slave
herself
unless
specially
manumitted
either
in
her
own
generation
or
in
that
immediately
above
her
it
is
from
such
alliances
as
these
that
the
coloured
race
of
jamaica
has
sprung
but
all
this
if
one
can
not
already
boast
that
it
is
changed
is
quickly
changing
matrimony
is
in
vogue
and
the
coloured
women
know
their
rights
and
are
inclined
to
claim
them
of
course
among
them
as
among
us
at
home
and
among
all
people
there
are
various
ranks
there
are
but
few
white
labourers
in
jamaica
and
but
few
negroes
who
are
not
labourers
but
the
coloured
people
are
to
be
found
in
all
ranks
from
that
of
the
prime
minister
for
they
have
a
prime
minister
in
jamaica
down
to
the
worker
in
the
among
their
women
many
are
now
highly
educated
for
they
send
their
children
to
english
schools
perhaps
if
i
were
to
say
fashionably
educated
i
might
be
more
strictly
correct
they
love
dearly
to
shine
to
run
over
the
piano
with
quick
and
loud
fingers
to
dance
with
skill
which
they
all
do
for
they
have
good
figures
and
correct
ears
to
know
and
display
the
little
tricks
and
graces
of
english
ladies
such
tricks
and
graces
as
are
to
be
learned
between
fifteen
and
seventeen
at
ealing
clapham
and
homsey
but
the
coloured
girls
of
a
class
below
these
perhaps
i
should
say
two
classes
below
them
are
the
most
amusing
specimens
of
jamaica
ladies
i
endeavoured
to
introduce
my
readers
to
one
at
port
antonio
they
can
not
be
called
pretty
for
the
upper
part
of
the
face
almost
always
recedes
but
they
have
good
figures
and
limbs
they
are
singularly
free
from
and
yet
they
are
not
impertinent
or
they
are
gracious
enough
with
the
pale
faces
when
treated
graciously
but
they
can
show
a
very
high
spirit
if
they
fancy
that
any
slight
is
shown
to
them
they
delight
to
talk
contemptuously
of
niggers
those
people
are
dirty
niggers
and
nasty
niggers
and
mere
niggers
i
have
heard
this
done
by
one
whom
i
had
absolutely
taken
for
a
negro
and
who
was
not
using
loud
abusive
language
but
gently
speaking
of
an
inferior
class
with
these
as
indeed
with
coloured
people
of
a
higher
grade
the
great
difficulty
is
with
their
language
they
can
not
acquire
the
natural
english
pronunciation
as
far
as
i
remember
i
have
never
heard
but
two
negroes
who
spoke
unbroken
english
and
the
lower
classes
of
the
coloured
people
though
they
are
not
equally
deficient
are
still
very
incapable
of
plain
english
articulation
the
th
is
to
them
as
to
foreigners
an
insuperable
difficulty
even
josephine
it
may
be
remembered
was
hardly
perfect
in
this
respect
chapter
vi
jamaica
white
men
it
seems
to
us
natural
that
white
men
should
hold
ascendency
over
those
who
are
black
or
coloured
although
we
have
emancipated
our
own
slaves
and
done
so
much
to
abolish
slavery
elsewhere
nevertheless
we
regard
the
negro
as
born
to
be
a
servant
we
do
not
realize
it
to
ourselves
that
it
is
his
right
to
share
with
us
the
high
places
of
the
world
and
that
it
should
be
an
affair
of
individual
merit
whether
we
wait
on
his
beck
or
he
on
ours
we
have
never
yet
brought
ourselves
so
to
think
and
probably
never
shall
they
still
are
to
us
a
servile
race
philanthropical
abolitionists
will
no
doubt
deny
the
truth
of
this
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
conviction
is
strong
with
them
could
they
analyze
their
own
convictions
as
it
is
with
others
where
white
men
and
black
men
are
together
the
white
will
order
and
the
black
will
obey
with
an
obedience
more
or
less
implicit
according
to
the
terms
on
which
they
stand
when
those
terms
are
slavery
the
white
men
order
with
austerity
and
the
black
obey
with
alacrity
but
such
terms
have
been
found
to
be
prejudicial
to
both
each
is
brutalized
by
the
contact
the
black
man
becomes
brutal
and
passive
as
a
beast
of
burden
the
white
man
becomes
brutal
and
ferocious
as
a
beast
of
prey
but
there
are
various
other
terms
on
which
they
may
stand
as
servants
and
masters
there
are
those
terms
which
regulate
employment
in
england
and
elsewhere
under
which
the
poor
time
is
his
money
and
the
rich
man
capital
his
certain
means
of
obtaining
labour
as
far
as
we
can
see
these
terms
if
properly
carried
out
are
the
best
which
human
wisdom
can
devise
for
the
employment
and
maintenance
of
mankind
here
in
england
they
are
not
always
properly
carried
out
at
an
occasional
spot
or
two
things
will
run
rusty
for
a
while
there
are
strikes
and
there
are
occasional
gluts
of
labour
very
distressing
to
the
poor
man
and
occasional
gluts
of
the
thing
laboured
very
embarrassing
to
the
rich
man
but
on
the
whole
seeing
that
after
all
the
arrangement
is
only
human
here
in
england
it
does
work
pretty
well
we
intended
no
doubt
when
we
emancipated
our
slaves
in
jamaica
that
the
affair
should
work
in
the
same
way
there
but
the
terms
there
at
present
are
as
far
removed
from
the
english
system
as
they
are
from
the
cuban
and
are
almost
as
abhorrent
to
justice
as
slavery
itself
as
abhorrent
to
justice
though
certainly
not
so
abhorrent
to
mercy
and
humanity
what
would
a
farmer
say
in
england
if
his
ploughman
declined
to
work
and
protested
that
he
preferred
going
to
his
master
granary
and
feeding
himself
and
his
children
on
his
master
corn
measter
noa
i
beez
thick
day
and
dunna
mind
to
do
no
wark
then
the
poorhouse
my
friend
the
poorhouse
and
hardly
that
starvation
first
and
nakedness
and
all
manner
of
misery
in
point
of
fact
our
friend
the
ploughman
must
go
and
work
even
though
his
bones
be
tired
as
no
doubt
they
often
are
he
knows
it
and
does
it
and
in
his
way
is
not
discontented
and
is
not
this
god
ordinance
his
ordinance
in
england
and
elsewhere
but
not
so
apparently
in
jamaica
there
we
had
a
devil
ordinance
in
those
days
of
slavery
and
having
rid
ourselves
of
that
we
have
still
a
devil
ordinance
of
another
sort
it
is
not
perhaps
very
easy
for
men
to
change
devil
work
into
heavenly
work
at
once
the
ordinance
that
at
present
we
have
existing
there
is
that
one
of
lying
in
the
sun
and
eating
yams
of
eating
not
your
own
yams
you
lazy
thieving
darkee
but
my
yams
mine
who
am
being
ruined
root
and
branch
stock
and
barrel
house
and
homestead
wife
and
bairns
because
you
wo
come
and
work
for
me
when
i
offer
you
due
wages
you
thieving
lazy
nigger
hush
will
say
my
angry
philanthropist
for
the
sake
of
humanity
hush
will
coarse
abuse
and
the
calling
of
names
avail
anything
is
he
not
a
man
and
a
brother
no
my
angry
philanthropist
while
he
will
not
work
and
will
only
steal
he
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
in
my
estimation
as
for
his
being
a
brother
that
we
may
say
is
fudge
and
i
will
call
no
professional
idler
a
man
but
the
abuse
above
given
is
not
intended
to
be
looked
on
as
coming
out
of
my
own
mouth
and
i
am
not
therefore
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
wording
of
it
it
is
inserted
there
with
small
inverted
commas
as
you
see
to
show
the
language
with
which
our
angry
white
friends
in
jamaica
speak
of
the
extraordinary
condition
in
which
they
have
found
themselves
placed
slowly
with
delay
that
has
been
awfully
ruinous
they
now
bethink
themselves
of
immigration
immigration
from
the
coast
of
africa
immigration
from
china
coolie
immigrants
from
hindostan
when
trinidad
and
guiana
have
helped
themselves
then
jamaica
bestirs
itself
and
what
then
then
the
negroes
bestir
themselves
for
heaven
sake
let
us
be
looked
to
are
we
not
to
be
protected
from
competition
if
labourers
be
brought
here
will
not
these
white
people
again
cultivate
their
grounds
shall
we
not
be
driven
from
our
squatting
patches
shall
we
not
starve
or
almost
worse
than
that
shall
we
not
again
fall
under
adam
curse
shall
we
not
again
be
slaves
in
reality
if
not
in
name
shall
we
not
have
to
work
the
negro
idea
of
emancipation
was
and
is
emancipation
not
from
slavery
but
from
work
to
lie
in
the
sun
and
eat
breadfruit
and
yams
is
his
idea
of
being
free
such
freedom
as
that
has
not
been
intended
for
man
in
this
world
and
i
say
that
jamaica
as
it
now
exists
is
still
under
a
devil
ordinance
one
can
not
wonder
that
the
white
man
here
should
be
vituperative
in
his
wrath
first
came
emancipation
he
bore
that
with
manful
courage
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
even
in
that
he
had
much
to
bear
the
price
he
got
for
his
slave
was
nothing
as
compared
with
that
actual
value
and
slavery
to
him
was
not
repugnant
as
it
is
to
you
and
me
one
trade
is
never
repugnant
to
one
feelings
but
so
much
he
did
bear
with
manly
courage
he
could
no
longer
make
sugar
but
he
would
not
at
any
rate
be
compelled
to
compete
with
those
who
could
the
protective
duties
would
save
him
there
then
free
trade
became
the
fashion
and
protective
duties
on
sugar
were
abolished
i
beg
it
may
not
be
thought
that
i
am
an
advocate
for
such
protection
the
west
indians
were
i
think
thrown
over
in
a
scurvy
manner
because
they
were
thrown
over
by
their
professed
friends
but
that
was
we
all
know
the
way
with
sir
robert
peel
well
free
trade
in
sugar
became
the
law
of
the
land
and
then
the
jamaica
planter
found
the
burden
too
heavy
for
his
back
the
money
which
had
flown
in
so
freely
came
in
such
small
driblets
that
he
could
make
no
improvement
portions
of
his
estate
went
out
of
cultivation
and
then
the
negro
who
should
have
tilled
the
remainder
squatted
on
it
and
said
no
massa
me
no
workee
and
now
to
complete
the
business
now
that
jamaica
is
at
length
looking
in
earnest
for
immigration
for
it
has
long
been
looking
for
immigration
with
listless
the
planter
is
told
that
the
labour
of
the
black
man
must
be
protected
if
he
be
vituperative
who
can
wonder
at
it
to
speak
the
truth
he
is
somewhat
vituperative
the
white
planter
of
jamaica
is
sore
and
vituperative
and
unconvinced
he
feels
that
he
has
been
ill
used
and
forced
to
go
to
the
wall
and
that
now
he
is
there
he
is
meanly
spoken
of
as
though
he
were
a
bore
and
a
nuisance
as
one
of
whom
the
colonial
office
would
gladly
rid
itself
if
it
knew
how
in
his
heart
of
hearts
there
dwells
a
feeling
that
after
all
slavery
was
not
so
vile
an
institution
that
that
devil
as
well
as
some
others
has
been
painted
too
black
in
those
old
days
the
work
was
done
the
sugar
was
made
the
workmen
were
comfortably
housed
and
fed
and
perhaps
on
his
father
estate
were
kindly
treated
at
any
rate
such
is
his
present
memory
the
money
came
in
things
went
on
pleasantly
and
he
can
not
remember
that
anybody
was
unhappy
but
now
can
it
be
wondered
at
that
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
should
still
have
a
sort
of
yearning
after
slavery
in
one
sense
at
any
rate
he
has
been
ill
used
the
turn
in
the
wheel
of
fortune
has
gone
against
him
as
it
went
against
the
weavers
when
machinery
became
the
fashion
circumstances
rather
than
his
own
fault
have
brought
him
low
energy
in
all
the
periods
of
his
adversity
might
perhaps
have
saved
him
as
it
has
saved
others
but
there
has
been
more
against
him
than
against
others
as
regards
him
himself
the
jamaica
planter
the
pure
blooded
white
owner
of
the
soil
i
think
that
his
day
in
jamaica
is
done
the
glory
i
fear
has
departed
from
his
house
the
weavers
have
been
swept
into
infinite
space
and
their
children
now
poke
the
engine
fires
or
piece
threads
standing
in
a
factory
the
children
of
the
old
jamaica
planter
must
also
push
their
fortunes
elsewhere
it
is
a
thousand
pities
for
he
was
i
may
still
say
is
the
prince
of
planters
the
true
aristocrat
of
the
west
indies
he
is
essentially
different
as
a
man
from
the
somewhat
barbadian
whose
estate
of
two
hundred
acres
has
perhaps
changed
hands
half
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
fifty
years
or
the
thoroughly
mercantile
sugar
manufacturer
of
guiana
he
has
so
many
of
the
characteristics
of
an
english
country
gentleman
that
he
does
not
strike
an
englishman
as
a
strange
being
he
has
his
pedigree
and
his
family
house
and
his
domain
around
him
he
shoots
and
fishes
and
some
few
years
since
in
the
good
days
he
even
kept
a
pack
of
hounds
he
is
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
and
as
such
has
much
to
do
a
planter
in
demerara
may
also
be
a
magistrate
probably
is
so
but
the
fact
does
not
come
forward
as
a
prominent
part
of
his
history
in
jamaica
too
there
is
scope
for
a
country
gentleman
they
have
their
counties
and
their
parishes
in
barbados
they
have
nothing
but
their
sugar
estates
they
have
county
society
local
balls
and
local
they
have
local
politics
local
quarrels
and
strong
local
friendships
in
all
these
things
one
feels
oneself
to
be
much
nearer
to
england
in
jamaica
than
in
any
other
of
the
west
indian
islands
all
this
is
beyond
measure
pleasant
and
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
it
should
not
last
i
fear
however
that
it
will
not
last
that
indeed
it
is
not
now
lasting
that
dear
lady
unwillingness
to
obey
her
lord
behests
when
he
asked
her
to
call
on
her
brown
neighbour
nay
the
very
fact
of
that
lord
request
both
go
to
prove
that
this
is
so
the
lady
felt
that
her
neighbour
was
cutting
the
very
ground
from
under
her
feet
the
lord
knew
that
old
times
were
changed
old
manners
gone
the
game
was
almost
up
when
he
found
himself
compelled
to
make
such
a
request
at
present
when
the
old
planter
sits
on
the
magisterial
bench
a
coloured
man
sits
beside
him
one
probably
on
each
side
of
him
at
road
sessions
he
can
not
carry
out
his
little
project
because
the
coloured
men
him
there
is
a
vacancy
for
his
parish
in
the
house
of
assembly
the
old
planter
scorns
the
house
of
assembly
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
coloured
man
is
therefore
chosen
and
votes
away
the
white
man
taxes
and
then
things
worse
and
worse
arise
not
only
coloured
men
get
into
office
but
black
men
also
what
is
our
old
aristocratic
planter
to
do
with
a
negro
churchwarden
on
one
side
and
a
negro
coroner
on
another
fancy
what
our
state
is
a
young
planter
said
to
me
i
dare
not
die
for
fear
i
should
be
sat
upon
by
a
black
man
i
know
that
it
will
be
thought
by
many
and
probably
said
by
some
that
these
are
distinctions
to
which
we
ought
not
to
allude
but
without
alluding
to
them
in
one
own
mind
it
is
impossible
to
understand
the
state
of
the
country
and
without
alluding
to
them
in
speech
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
state
of
the
country
the
fact
is
that
in
jamaica
at
the
present
day
the
coloured
people
do
stand
on
strong
ground
and
that
they
do
not
so
stand
with
the
goodwill
of
the
old
aristocracy
of
the
country
they
have
forced
their
way
up
and
now
loudly
protest
that
they
intend
to
keep
it
i
think
that
they
will
keep
it
and
that
on
the
whole
it
will
be
well
for
us
to
have
created
a
race
capable
of
living
and
working
in
the
climate
without
inconvenience
it
is
singular
however
how
little
all
this
is
understood
in
england
there
it
is
conceived
that
white
men
and
coloured
men
white
ladies
and
coloured
ladies
meet
together
and
amalgamate
without
any
difference
the
duchess
of
this
and
lord
that
are
very
happy
to
have
at
their
tables
some
intelligent
dark
gentleman
or
even
a
negro
though
he
may
not
perhaps
be
very
intelligent
there
is
some
little
excitement
in
it
some
change
from
the
common
and
perhaps
also
an
easy
opportunity
of
practising
on
a
small
scale
those
philanthropic
views
which
they
preach
with
so
much
eloquence
when
one
hobnobs
over
a
glass
of
champagne
with
a
dark
gentleman
he
is
in
some
sort
a
man
and
a
brother
but
the
duchess
and
the
lord
think
that
because
the
dark
gentleman
is
to
their
taste
he
must
necessarily
be
as
much
to
the
taste
of
the
neighbours
among
whom
he
has
been
born
and
bred
of
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
see
him
from
his
childhood
there
never
was
a
greater
mistake
a
coloured
man
may
be
a
fine
prophet
in
london
but
he
will
be
no
prophet
in
jamaica
which
is
his
own
country
no
prophet
at
any
rate
among
his
white
neighbours
i
knew
a
case
in
which
a
very
intelligent
nay
i
believe
a
young
coloured
gentleman
was
sent
out
by
certain
excellent
philanthropic
to
fill
an
official
situation
in
jamaica
he
was
a
stranger
to
jamaica
never
having
been
there
before
now
when
he
was
so
sent
out
the
home
alluded
to
intimated
to
certain
other
in
jamaica
that
their
dark
protégé
would
be
a
great
acquisition
to
the
society
of
the
place
i
mention
this
to
show
the
ignorance
of
those
london
not
as
to
the
capability
of
the
young
gentleman
which
probably
was
not
but
as
to
the
manners
and
life
of
the
place
i
imagine
that
the
gentleman
has
hardly
once
found
himself
in
that
society
which
it
was
supposed
he
would
adorn
the
time
however
will
probably
come
when
he
and
others
of
the
same
class
will
have
sufficient
society
of
their
own
i
have
said
elsewhere
that
the
coloured
people
in
jamaica
have
made
their
way
into
society
and
in
what
i
now
say
i
may
seem
to
contradict
myself
into
what
may
perhaps
be
termed
public
society
they
have
made
their
way
those
who
have
seen
the
details
of
colonial
life
will
know
that
there
is
a
public
society
to
which
people
are
admitted
or
not
admitted
according
to
their
acknowledged
rights
governor
parties
public
balls
and
certain
meetings
which
are
and
are
of
this
nature
a
governor
in
jamaica
would
i
imagine
not
conceive
himself
to
have
the
power
of
excluding
coloured
people
from
his
table
even
if
he
wished
it
but
in
barbados
i
doubt
whether
a
governor
could
if
he
wished
it
do
the
reverse
so
far
coloured
people
in
jamaica
have
made
their
footing
good
and
they
are
gradually
advancing
beyond
this
but
not
the
less
as
a
rule
are
they
disliked
by
the
old
white
aristocracy
of
the
country
in
a
strong
degree
by
the
planters
themselves
but
in
a
much
stronger
by
the
planters
wives
so
much
for
my
theory
as
to
the
races
of
men
in
jamaica
and
as
to
the
social
condition
of
the
white
and
coloured
people
with
reference
to
each
other
now
i
would
say
a
word
or
two
respecting
the
white
man
as
he
himself
is
without
reference
either
to
his
neighbour
or
to
his
prospects
a
better
fellow
can
not
be
found
anywhere
than
a
gentleman
of
jamaica
or
one
with
whom
it
is
easier
to
live
on
pleasant
terms
he
is
generally
hospitable
affable
and
generous
easy
to
know
and
pleasant
when
known
not
given
perhaps
to
much
deep
erudition
but
capable
of
talking
with
ease
on
most
subjects
of
conversation
fond
of
society
and
of
pleasure
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
but
not
generally
addicted
to
low
pleasures
he
is
often
witty
and
has
a
sharp
side
to
his
tongue
if
occasion
be
given
him
to
use
it
he
is
not
generally
i
think
a
man
had
he
been
so
the
country
perhaps
would
not
have
been
in
its
present
condition
but
he
is
bright
and
clever
and
in
spite
of
all
that
he
has
gone
through
he
is
at
all
times
no
men
are
fonder
of
the
country
to
which
they
belong
or
prouder
of
the
name
of
great
britain
than
these
jamaicans
it
has
been
our
policy
and
as
regards
our
larger
colonies
the
policy
i
have
no
doubt
has
been
beneficial
to
leave
our
dependencies
very
much
to
themselves
to
interfere
in
the
way
of
governing
as
little
as
might
be
and
to
withdraw
as
much
as
possible
from
any
participation
in
their
internal
concerns
this
policy
is
anything
but
popular
with
the
white
aristocracy
of
jamaica
they
would
fain
if
it
were
possible
dispense
altogether
with
their
legislature
and
be
governed
altogether
from
home
in
spite
of
what
they
have
suffered
they
are
still
willing
to
trust
the
statesmen
of
england
but
are
most
unwilling
to
trust
the
statesmen
of
jamaica
nothing
is
more
peculiar
than
the
way
in
which
the
word
home
is
used
in
jamaica
and
indeed
all
through
the
west
indies
with
the
white
people
it
always
signifies
england
even
though
the
person
using
the
word
has
never
been
there
i
could
never
trace
the
use
of
the
word
in
jamaica
as
applied
by
white
men
or
white
women
to
the
home
in
which
they
lived
not
even
though
that
home
had
been
the
dwelling
of
their
fathers
as
well
as
of
themselves
the
word
home
with
them
is
sacred
and
means
something
holier
than
a
habitation
in
the
tropics
it
refers
always
to
the
old
country
in
this
respect
as
in
so
many
others
an
englishman
differs
greatly
from
a
frenchman
though
our
english
as
a
rule
are
much
more
given
to
colonize
than
they
are
though
we
spread
ourselves
over
the
face
of
the
globe
while
they
have
established
comparatively
but
few
settlements
in
the
outer
world
nevertheless
when
we
leave
our
country
we
almost
always
do
so
with
some
idea
be
it
ever
so
vague
that
we
shall
return
to
it
again
and
again
make
it
our
home
but
the
frenchman
divests
himself
of
any
such
idea
he
also
loves
france
or
at
any
rate
loves
paris
but
his
object
is
to
carry
his
paris
with
him
to
make
a
paris
for
himself
whether
it
be
in
a
sugar
island
among
the
antilles
or
in
a
trading
town
upon
the
levant
and
in
some
respects
the
frenchman
is
the
wiser
man
he
never
looks
behind
him
with
regret
he
does
his
best
to
make
his
new
house
comfortable
the
spot
on
which
he
fixes
is
his
home
and
so
he
calls
it
and
so
regards
it
but
with
an
englishman
in
the
west
indies
even
with
an
english
creole
england
is
always
his
home
if
the
people
in
jamaica
have
any
prejudice
it
is
on
the
subject
of
heat
i
suppose
they
have
a
general
idea
that
their
island
is
hotter
than
england
but
they
never
reduce
this
to
an
individual
idea
respecting
their
own
habitation
come
and
dine
with
me
a
man
says
to
you
i
can
give
you
a
cool
bed
the
invitation
at
first
sounded
strange
to
me
but
i
soon
got
used
to
it
i
soon
even
liked
it
though
i
found
too
often
that
the
promise
was
not
kept
how
could
it
be
kept
while
the
quicksilver
was
standing
at
in
the
shade
and
each
man
boasts
that
his
house
is
ten
degrees
cooler
than
that
of
his
neighbours
and
each
man
if
you
contest
the
point
has
a
reason
to
prove
why
it
must
be
so
but
a
stranger
at
any
rate
round
kingston
is
apt
to
put
the
matter
in
a
different
light
one
place
may
be
hotter
than
another
but
cool
is
a
word
which
he
never
uses
on
the
whole
i
think
that
the
heat
of
kingston
jamaica
is
more
oppressive
than
that
of
any
other
place
among
the
british
west
indies
when
one
gets
down
to
the
spanish
coast
then
indeed
one
can
look
back
even
to
kingston
with
regret
chapter
vii
jamaica
sugar
that
jamaica
was
a
land
of
wealth
rivalling
the
east
in
its
means
of
riches
nay
excelling
it
as
a
market
for
capital
as
a
place
in
which
money
might
be
turned
and
that
it
now
is
a
spot
on
the
earth
almost
more
than
any
other
so
much
is
known
almost
to
all
men
that
this
change
was
brought
about
by
the
manumission
of
the
slaves
which
was
completed
in
of
that
also
the
english
world
is
generally
aware
and
there
probably
the
usual
knowledge
about
jamaica
ends
and
we
may
also
say
that
the
solicitude
of
englishmen
at
large
goes
no
further
the
families
who
are
connected
with
jamaica
by
ties
of
interest
are
becoming
fewer
and
fewer
property
has
been
abandoned
as
good
for
nothing
and
nearly
forgotten
or
has
been
sold
for
what
wretched
trifle
it
would
fetch
or
left
to
an
overseer
who
is
hardly
expected
to
send
home
proceeds
is
merely
ordered
imperatively
to
apply
for
no
subsidies
fathers
no
longer
send
their
younger
sons
to
make
their
fortunes
there
young
english
girls
no
longer
come
out
as
brides
dukes
and
earls
do
not
now
govern
the
rich
gem
of
the
west
spending
their
tens
of
thousands
in
royal
magnificence
and
laying
by
other
tens
of
thousands
for
home
consumption
in
lieu
of
this
some
governor
by
profession
unfortunate
for
the
moment
takes
jamaica
with
a
groan
as
a
to
some
better
barataria
new
zealand
perhaps
or
frazer
river
and
by
strict
economy
tries
to
save
the
price
of
his
silver
forks
equerries
and
private
secretaries
no
longer
flaunt
it
about
spanish
town
the
flaunting
about
spanish
town
is
now
of
a
dull
sort
ichabod
the
glory
of
that
house
is
gone
the
palmy
days
of
that
island
are
over
those
who
are
failing
and
falling
in
the
world
excite
but
little
interest
and
so
it
is
at
present
with
jamaica
from
time
to
time
we
hear
that
properties
which
used
to
bring
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
are
not
now
worth
five
hundred
pounds
in
fee
simple
we
hear
it
thank
our
stars
that
we
have
not
been
brought
up
in
the
jamaica
line
and
there
an
end
of
it
if
we
have
young
friends
whom
we
wish
to
send
forth
into
the
world
we
search
the
maps
with
them
at
our
elbows
but
we
put
our
hands
over
the
west
indies
over
the
first
fruits
of
the
courage
and
skill
of
columbus
as
a
spot
tabooed
by
providence
nay
if
we
could
we
would
fain
forget
jamaica
altogether
but
there
it
is
a
spot
on
the
earth
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
or
forgotten
altogether
let
us
wish
it
ever
so
much
it
belongs
to
us
and
must
be
in
some
sort
thought
of
and
managed
and
if
possible
governed
though
the
utter
sinking
of
jamaica
under
the
sea
might
not
be
regarded
as
a
misfortune
it
is
not
to
be
thought
of
that
it
should
belong
to
others
than
britain
how
should
we
look
at
the
english
politician
who
would
propose
to
sell
it
to
the
united
states
or
beg
spain
to
take
it
as
an
appendage
to
cuba
it
is
one
of
the
few
sores
in
our
huge
and
healthy
carcase
and
the
sore
has
been
now
running
so
long
that
we
have
almost
given
over
asking
whether
it
be
curable
this
at
any
rate
is
certain
it
will
not
sink
into
the
sea
but
will
remain
there
inhabited
if
not
by
white
men
then
by
coloured
men
or
black
and
must
unfortunately
be
governed
by
us
english
we
have
indulged
our
antipathy
to
cruelty
by
abolishing
slavery
we
have
made
the
peculiar
institution
an
impossibility
under
the
british
crown
but
in
doing
so
we
overthrew
one
particular
interest
and
alas
we
overthrew
also
and
necessarily
so
the
holders
of
that
interest
as
for
the
twenty
millions
which
we
gave
to
the
it
was
at
best
but
as
though
we
had
put
down
awls
and
lasts
by
act
of
parliament
and
giving
the
shoemakers
the
price
of
their
tools
told
them
they
might
make
shoes
as
they
best
could
without
them
failing
any
such
possibility
that
they
might
live
on
the
price
of
their
lost
articles
well
the
shoemakers
did
their
best
and
continued
their
trade
in
shoes
under
much
difficulty
but
then
we
have
had
another
antipathy
to
indulge
and
have
indulged
it
our
antipathy
to
protection
we
have
abolished
the
duty
on
sugar
and
the
shoemakers
who
have
no
awls
and
lasts
have
to
compete
sadly
with
their
happy
neighbours
possessed
of
these
useful
shoemaking
utensils
make
no
more
shoes
but
make
something
in
lieu
of
shoes
we
say
to
them
the
world
wants
not
shoes
only
make
hats
give
up
your
sugar
and
bring
forth
produce
that
does
not
require
slave
labour
could
the
men
of
jamaica
with
one
voice
speak
out
such
words
as
the
experience
of
the
world
might
teach
them
they
would
probably
answer
thus
yes
in
two
hundred
years
or
so
we
will
do
so
so
long
it
will
take
to
alter
the
settled
trade
and
habit
of
a
community
in
the
mean
time
for
ourselves
our
living
selves
our
late
luxurious
homes
our
idle
creole
wives
our
children
coming
and
to
come
for
ourselves
what
immediate
compensation
do
you
intend
to
offer
us
mr
bull
bull
with
sufficient
anger
at
such
importunity
with
sufficient
remembrance
of
his
late
twenty
millions
of
pounds
sterling
with
some
plain
allusions
to
that
payment
buttons
up
his
and
growls
angrily
abolition
of
slavery
is
good
and
free
trade
is
good
such
little
insight
as
a
plain
man
may
have
into
the
affairs
around
him
seems
to
me
to
suffice
for
the
expression
of
such
opinion
nor
will
i
presume
to
say
that
those
who
proposed
either
the
one
law
or
the
other
were
premature
to
get
a
good
law
passed
and
out
of
hand
is
always
desirable
there
are
from
day
to
day
so
many
new
impediments
but
the
law
having
been
passed
we
should
think
somewhat
of
the
sufferers
planters
in
jamaica
assert
that
when
the
abolition
of
slavery
was
hurried
on
by
the
termination
of
the
apprentice
system
before
the
time
first
stipulated
they
were
promised
by
the
government
at
home
that
their
interests
should
be
protected
by
high
duties
on
sugar
that
such
pledge
was
ever
absolutely
made
i
do
not
credit
but
that
if
made
it
could
be
worth
anything
no
man
looking
to
the
history
of
england
could
imagine
what
minister
can
pledge
his
successors
in
jamaica
it
is
said
that
the
pledge
was
given
and
broken
by
the
same
man
by
sir
robert
peel
but
when
did
sir
robert
peel
pledge
in
one
year
bind
even
his
own
conduct
in
the
next
the
fact
perhaps
is
this
that
no
one
interest
can
ever
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
national
progress
we
could
not
stop
machinery
for
the
sake
of
the
weavers
the
poor
weavers
felt
themselves
aggrieved
knew
that
the
very
bread
was
taken
from
their
mouths
their
cup
from
their
lips
they
felt
poor
weavers
that
they
could
not
take
themselves
in
middle
life
to
poking
fires
and
greasing
wheels
time
the
eater
of
things
has
now
pretty
well
eaten
the
weavers
them
and
their
miseries
must
it
not
be
so
also
with
the
jamaica
planters
in
the
mean
time
the
sight
as
regards
the
white
man
is
a
sad
one
to
see
and
almost
the
sadder
in
that
the
last
three
or
four
years
have
been
in
a
slight
degree
prosperous
to
the
jamaica
so
that
this
question
of
producing
sugar
in
that
island
at
a
rate
that
will
pay
for
itself
is
not
quite
answered
the
drowning
man
still
clings
by
a
rope
end
though
it
be
but
by
half
an
inch
and
that
held
between
his
teeth
let
go
thou
unhappy
one
and
drown
thyself
out
of
the
way
is
it
not
thus
that
great
britain
speaking
to
him
from
the
high
places
in
exeter
hall
shouts
to
him
in
his
death
struggles
are
englishmen
in
general
aware
that
half
the
sugar
estates
in
jamaica
and
i
believe
more
than
half
the
coffee
plantations
have
gone
back
into
a
state
of
bush
that
all
this
land
rich
with
the
richest
produce
only
some
thirty
years
since
has
now
fallen
back
into
wilderness
that
the
world
has
hereabouts
so
retrograded
that
chaos
and
darkness
have
reswallowed
so
vast
an
extent
of
the
most
bountiful
land
that
civilization
had
ever
mastered
and
that
too
beneath
the
british
government
and
of
those
who
are
now
growing
canes
in
jamaica
a
great
portion
are
gentlemen
who
have
lately
bought
their
estates
for
the
value
of
the
copper
in
the
and
of
the
metal
in
the
if
to
this
has
been
added
anything
like
a
fair
value
for
wheels
in
the
machinery
the
estate
has
not
been
badly
sold
some
estates
there
are
and
they
are
not
many
which
are
still
worked
by
the
agents
attorneys
is
the
proper
word
of
rich
proprietors
in
england
of
men
so
rich
that
they
have
been
able
to
bear
the
continual
drain
of
properties
that
for
years
have
been
always
losing
of
men
who
have
had
wealth
and
spirit
to
endure
this
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
they
are
few
and
that
many
whose
spirit
has
been
high
but
wealth
insufficient
have
gone
grievously
to
the
wall
in
the
attempt
and
there
are
still
some
who
living
on
the
spot
have
hitherto
pulled
through
it
all
who
have
watched
houses
falling
and
the
wilderness
progressing
and
have
still
stuck
to
their
homes
and
their
work
men
whose
properties
for
ten
years
counting
from
the
discontinuance
of
protection
have
gradually
grown
less
and
less
beneath
their
eyes
till
utter
want
has
been
close
to
them
and
yet
they
have
held
on
in
the
good
times
they
may
have
made
five
hundred
hogsheads
of
sugar
every
year
it
has
come
to
that
with
them
that
in
some
years
they
have
made
but
thirty
but
they
have
made
that
thirty
and
still
held
on
all
honour
at
least
to
them
for
their
sake
if
for
that
of
no
others
we
would
be
tempted
to
pray
that
these
few
years
of
their
prosperity
may
be
prolonged
and
grow
somewhat
fatter
the
exported
produce
of
jamaica
consists
chiefly
of
sugar
and
rum
the
article
next
in
importance
is
coffee
then
they
export
also
logwood
arrowroot
pimento
and
ginger
but
not
in
quantities
to
make
them
of
much
national
value
mahogany
is
also
cut
here
and
fustic
but
sugar
and
rum
are
still
the
staples
of
the
island
now
all
the
world
knows
that
rum
and
sugar
are
made
from
the
same
plant
and
yet
every
one
will
tell
you
that
the
cane
can
hardly
be
got
to
thrive
in
jamaica
without
slave
labour
will
tell
you
also
that
the
land
of
jamaica
is
so
generous
that
it
will
give
forth
many
of
the
most
wonderful
fruits
of
the
world
almost
without
labour
putting
these
two
things
together
would
not
any
simple
man
advise
them
to
abandon
sugar
ah
he
would
be
very
simple
if
he
were
to
do
so
with
a
voice
that
could
make
itself
well
heard
and
should
dare
to
do
so
in
jamaica
men
there
are
generally
tolerant
of
opinion
on
most
matters
and
submit
to
be
talked
to
on
their
own
shortcomings
and
colonial
mismanagement
with
a
decent
grace
you
may
advise
them
to
do
this
and
counsel
them
to
do
that
referring
to
their
own
immediate
concerns
without
receiving
that
rebuke
which
your
interference
might
probably
deserve
but
do
not
try
their
complaisance
too
far
do
not
advise
them
to
give
over
making
sugar
if
you
give
such
advice
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
the
island
will
soon
be
too
hot
to
hold
you
sugar
is
loved
there
whether
wisely
loved
or
not
if
not
wisely
then
too
well
when
i
hear
a
jamaica
planter
talking
of
sugar
i
can
not
but
think
of
burns
and
his
muse
that
had
made
him
poor
and
kept
him
so
and
the
planter
is
just
as
ready
to
give
up
his
canes
as
the
poet
was
to
abandon
his
song
the
production
of
sugar
and
the
necessary
concomitant
production
of
rum
for
in
jamaica
the
two
do
necessarily
go
together
is
not
one
would
say
an
alluring
occupation
i
do
not
here
intend
to
indulge
my
readers
with
a
detailed
description
of
the
whole
progress
from
the
planting
or
ratooning
of
the
cane
till
the
sugar
and
the
rum
are
shipped
books
there
are
no
doubt
much
wiser
than
mine
in
which
the
whole
process
is
developed
but
i
would
wish
this
much
to
be
understood
that
the
sugar
planter
as
things
at
present
are
must
attend
to
and
be
master
of
and
practically
carry
out
three
several
trades
he
must
be
an
agriculturist
and
grow
his
cane
and
like
all
agriculturists
must
take
his
crop
from
the
ground
and
have
it
ready
for
use
as
the
wheat
grower
does
in
england
and
the
cotton
grower
in
america
but
then
he
must
also
be
a
manufacturer
and
that
in
a
branch
of
manufacture
which
requires
complicated
machinery
the
wheat
grower
does
not
grind
his
wheat
and
make
it
into
bread
nor
does
the
cotton
grower
fabricate
calico
but
the
grower
of
canes
must
make
sugar
he
must
have
his
and
his
water
power
and
his
steam
power
he
must
dabble
in
machinery
and
in
fact
be
a
manchester
manufacturer
as
well
as
a
kent
farmer
and
then
over
and
beyond
this
he
must
be
a
distiller
the
sugar
leaves
him
fit
for
your
puddings
and
the
rum
fit
for
your
punch
always
excepting
the
slight
article
of
adulteration
which
you
are
good
enough
to
add
afterwards
yourselves
such
a
complication
of
trades
would
not
be
thought
very
alluring
to
a
gentleman
farmer
in
england
and
yet
the
jamaica
proprietor
holds
faithfully
by
his
it
has
been
said
that
sugar
is
an
article
which
for
its
proper
production
requires
slave
labour
that
this
is
absolutely
so
is
certainly
not
the
fact
for
very
good
sugar
is
made
in
jamaica
without
it
that
thousands
of
pounds
could
be
made
with
slaves
where
only
hundreds
are
made
or
as
the
case
may
be
are
lost
without
it
i
do
not
doubt
the
complaint
generally
resolves
itself
to
this
that
free
labour
in
jamaica
can
not
be
commanded
that
it
can
not
be
had
always
and
up
to
a
certain
given
quantity
at
a
certain
moment
that
labour
is
scarce
and
therefore
high
priced
and
that
labour
being
high
priced
a
negro
can
live
on
half
a
day
wages
and
will
not
therefore
work
the
whole
day
will
not
always
work
any
part
of
the
day
at
all
seeing
that
his
yams
his
breadfruit
and
his
plantains
are
ready
to
his
hands
but
the
slaves
oh
those
were
the
good
times
i
have
in
another
chapter
said
a
few
words
about
the
negroes
as
at
present
existing
in
jamaica
i
also
shall
say
a
few
words
as
to
slavery
elsewhere
and
i
will
endeavour
not
to
repeat
myself
this
much
however
is
at
least
clear
to
all
men
that
you
can
not
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
you
can
not
abolish
slavery
to
the
infinite
good
of
your
souls
your
minds
and
intellects
and
yet
retain
it
for
the
good
of
your
pockets
seeing
that
these
men
are
free
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
begrudge
them
the
use
of
their
freedom
if
i
have
means
to
lie
in
the
sun
and
meditate
idle
why
o
my
worthy
taskmaster
should
you
expect
me
to
pull
out
at
thy
behest
long
reels
of
cotton
long
reels
of
law
jargon
long
reels
of
official
verbosity
long
reels
of
gossamer
literature
why
indeed
not
having
means
so
to
lie
i
do
pull
out
the
reels
taking
such
wages
as
i
can
get
and
am
thankful
but
my
friend
and
brother
over
there
my
shining
negro
is
a
richer
man
than
i
he
lies
under
his
and
eats
the
luscious
fruit
in
the
sun
he
sends
his
black
urchin
up
for
a
breadfruit
and
behold
the
family
table
is
spread
he
pierces
a
and
lo
there
is
his
beverage
he
lies
on
the
grass
surrounded
by
oranges
bananas
and
oh
my
hard
taskmaster
of
the
is
he
not
better
off
than
thou
why
should
he
work
at
thy
order
no
massa
me
weak
in
me
belly
me
no
workee
me
no
like
workee
just
little
moment
yes
sambo
has
learned
to
have
his
own
way
though
hardly
learned
to
claim
his
right
without
lying
that
this
is
all
bad
bad
nearly
as
bad
can
be
bad
perhaps
as
anything
short
of
slavery
all
men
will
allow
it
will
be
quite
as
bad
in
the
long
run
for
the
negro
as
for
the
white
man
worse
indeed
for
the
white
man
will
by
degrees
wash
his
hands
of
the
whole
concern
but
as
matters
are
one
can
not
wonder
that
the
black
man
will
not
work
the
question
stands
thus
can
not
he
be
made
to
do
so
can
it
not
be
contrived
that
he
shall
be
free
free
as
is
the
englishman
and
yet
compelled
as
is
the
englishman
to
eat
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
i
utterly
disbelieve
in
statistics
as
a
science
and
am
never
myself
guided
by
any
statement
of
figures
from
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
or
such
like
to
my
mind
it
is
an
hallucination
such
statements
are
ignes
fatui
figures
when
they
go
beyond
six
in
number
represent
to
me
not
facts
but
dreams
or
sometimes
worse
than
dreams
i
have
therefore
no
right
myself
to
offer
statistics
to
the
reader
but
it
was
stated
in
the
census
taken
in
that
there
were
sixteen
thousand
white
people
in
the
island
and
about
three
hundred
thousand
blacks
there
were
also
about
seventy
thousand
coloured
people
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
latter
as
a
middle
class
and
regarding
the
black
as
the
free
servants
of
the
white
one
would
say
that
labour
should
not
be
so
deficient
but
what
if
your
free
servants
do
work
unfortunately
know
how
to
live
without
working
the
political
question
that
presses
upon
me
in
viewing
jamaica
is
certainly
this
will
the
growth
of
sugar
pay
in
jamaica
or
will
it
not
i
have
already
stated
my
conviction
that
a
change
is
now
taking
place
in
the
very
blood
and
nature
of
the
men
who
are
destined
to
be
the
dominant
classes
in
these
western
tropical
latitudes
that
the
white
man
the
white
englishman
or
white
english
creole
will
ever
again
be
a
thoroughly
successful
sugar
grower
in
jamaica
i
do
not
believe
that
the
brown
man
may
be
so
is
very
probable
but
great
changes
must
first
be
made
in
the
countries
around
him
while
the
peculiar
institution
exists
in
cuba
brazil
porto
rico
and
the
southern
states
it
can
not
i
think
come
to
pass
a
plentiful
crop
in
cuba
may
in
any
year
bring
sugar
to
a
price
which
will
give
no
return
whatever
to
the
jamaica
grower
a
spare
crop
in
jamaica
itself
will
have
the
same
result
and
there
are
many
causes
for
spare
crops
drought
for
instance
and
floods
and
abounding
rats
and
want
of
capital
to
renew
and
manure
the
plants
at
present
the
trade
will
only
give
in
good
years
a
fair
profit
to
those
who
have
purchased
their
land
almost
for
nothing
a
trade
that
can
not
stand
many
misfortunes
can
hardly
exist
prosperously
this
trade
has
stood
very
many
but
i
doubt
whether
it
can
stand
more
the
peculiar
institution
however
will
not
live
for
ever
the
time
must
come
when
abolition
will
be
popular
even
in
louisiana
and
when
it
is
law
there
it
will
be
the
law
in
cuba
also
if
that
day
shall
have
arrived
before
the
last
in
the
island
shall
have
been
stopped
jamaica
may
then
compete
with
other
free
countries
the
world
will
not
do
without
sugar
let
it
be
produced
by
slaves
or
free
men
but
though
a
man
may
venture
to
foretell
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
states
and
yet
call
himself
no
prophet
he
must
be
a
wiser
man
than
i
who
can
foretell
the
time
it
will
hardly
be
nor
yet
the
next
day
it
will
scarcely
come
so
that
we
may
see
it
before
it
does
come
it
may
easily
be
that
the
last
in
poor
jamaica
will
in
truth
have
stopped
chapter
viii
jamaica
emperor
soulouque
we
all
remember
the
day
when
smith
landed
at
newhaven
and
took
up
his
abode
quietly
at
the
inn
there
poor
smith
in
the
ripeness
of
time
he
has
betaken
himself
a
stage
further
on
his
long
journey
travelling
now
probably
without
disguise
either
that
of
a
citizen
king
or
of
a
citizen
smith
and
now
following
his
illustrious
example
the
soulouque
has
sought
the
safety
always
to
be
found
on
english
territories
by
sovereigns
out
of
place
in
january
his
highness
landed
at
kingston
jamaica
having
made
his
town
of
port
au
prince
and
his
kingdom
of
hayti
somewhat
too
hot
to
hold
him
all
the
world
probably
knows
that
king
soulouque
is
a
black
man
one
blacker
never
endured
the
meridian
heat
of
a
tropical
sun
the
island
which
was
christened
hispaniola
by
columbus
has
resumed
its
ancient
name
of
hayti
it
is
however
divided
into
two
kingdoms
two
republics
one
may
now
say
that
to
the
east
is
generally
called
domingo
having
borrowed
the
name
given
by
columbus
to
a
town
this
is
by
far
the
larger
but
at
the
same
time
the
poorer
division
of
the
island
that
to
the
west
is
now
called
hayti
and
over
this
territory
soulouque
reigned
as
emperor
he
reigned
as
emperor
and
was
so
styled
having
been
elected
as
president
in
which
little
change
in
his
state
he
has
been
imitated
by
a
neighbour
of
ours
with
a
success
almost
equal
to
his
own
for
some
dozen
years
the
success
of
soulouque
was
very
considerable
he
has
had
a
dominion
which
has
been
almost
despotic
and
has
so
rumour
says
invested
some
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
european
funds
in
this
latter
point
his
imitator
has
i
fear
hardly
equalled
him
but
a
higher
ambition
fired
the
bosom
of
soulouque
and
he
sighed
after
the
territories
of
his
neighbours
not
generously
to
bestow
them
on
other
kings
but
that
he
might
keep
them
on
his
own
behoof
soulouque
desired
to
be
emperor
of
the
whole
island
and
he
sounded
his
trumpet
and
prepared
his
arms
he
called
together
his
army
and
put
on
the
boots
of
bombastes
he
put
on
the
boots
of
bombastes
and
bade
his
men
meet
him
at
the
barleymow
or
elsewhere
but
it
seems
that
his
men
were
slow
in
coming
to
the
rendezvous
nothing
that
soulouque
could
say
nothing
that
he
could
do
no
admonitions
through
his
sternest
government
ministers
no
reading
of
the
mutiny
act
by
his
commanders
and
generals
would
induce
them
actually
to
make
an
assault
at
arms
then
soulouque
was
angry
and
in
his
anger
he
maltreated
his
army
he
put
his
men
into
pits
and
kept
them
there
without
food
left
them
to
be
eaten
by
vermin
to
be
fed
upon
while
they
could
not
feed
and
played
upon
the
whole
such
a
melodrama
of
autocratic
tricks
and
fantasies
as
might
have
done
honour
to
a
white
nero
then
at
last
black
human
nature
could
endure
no
more
and
soulouque
dreading
a
pit
for
his
own
majesty
was
forced
to
run
in
one
respect
he
was
more
fortunate
than
smith
in
his
dire
necessity
an
english
was
found
to
be
at
hand
the
was
steaming
home
from
jamaica
and
the
officer
in
command
having
been
appealed
to
for
assistance
consented
to
return
to
kingston
with
the
royal
suite
this
she
did
and
on
the
of
january
soulouque
with
his
wife
and
daughter
his
prime
minister
and
certain
maids
of
honour
was
landed
at
the
quays
when
under
the
ægis
of
british
protection
the
was
of
course
safe
but
he
had
not
exactly
chosen
a
bed
of
roses
for
himself
in
coming
to
jamaica
it
might
be
probable
that
a
bed
of
roses
was
not
easily
to
be
found
at
the
moment
at
kingston
there
were
collected
many
haytians
who
had
either
been
banished
by
soulouque
in
the
plenitude
of
his
power
or
had
run
from
him
as
he
was
now
running
from
his
subjects
there
were
many
whose
brothers
and
fathers
had
been
destroyed
in
hayti
whose
friends
had
perished
under
the
hands
of
the
tyrant
executioner
for
whom
pits
would
have
been
prepared
had
they
not
vanished
speedily
these
refugees
had
sought
safety
also
in
jamaica
and
for
them
a
day
of
triumph
had
now
arrived
they
were
not
the
men
to
allow
an
opportunity
for
triumph
to
pass
without
enjoying
it
these
were
mostly
brown
men
men
of
a
mixed
race
men
and
indeed
women
also
with
soulouque
and
his
government
such
had
found
no
favour
he
had
been
glad
to
welcome
white
residents
in
his
kingdom
and
of
course
had
rejoiced
in
having
black
men
as
his
subjects
but
of
the
coloured
people
he
had
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
rid
himself
he
had
done
so
to
a
great
extent
and
many
of
them
were
now
ready
to
welcome
him
at
kingston
kingston
does
not
rejoice
in
public
equipages
of
much
pretensions
nor
are
there
to
be
hired
many
carriages
fit
for
the
conveyance
of
royalty
even
in
its
decadence
two
small
wretched
vehicles
were
however
procured
such
as
ply
in
the
streets
there
and
carry
passengers
to
the
spanish
town
railway
at
sixpence
a
head
in
one
of
these
sat
soulouque
and
his
wife
with
a
british
officer
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
and
with
two
black
policemen
hanging
behind
in
another
similarly
guarded
were
packed
the
countess
olive
that
being
the
name
of
the
daughter
and
her
attendants
and
thus
travelling
by
different
streets
they
made
their
way
to
their
hotel
one
would
certainly
have
wished
in
despite
of
those
wretched
pits
that
they
had
been
allowed
to
do
so
without
annoyance
but
such
was
not
the
case
the
banished
haytians
had
it
not
in
their
philosophy
to
abstain
from
triumphing
on
a
fallen
enemy
they
surrounded
the
carriages
with
a
dusky
cloud
and
received
the
fugitives
with
howls
of
at
their
abasement
nor
was
this
all
when
the
royal
party
was
duly
lodged
at
the
tavern
the
lodged
themselves
opposite
there
they
held
a
dignity
ball
in
token
of
their
joy
and
for
three
days
maintained
their
position
in
order
that
poor
soulouque
might
witness
their
rejoicings
they
have
said
a
mass
over
him
the
wretched
being
said
the
landlady
of
my
hotel
to
me
triumphantly
said
a
mass
over
him
yes
the
black
nigger
king
indeed
said
a
mass
over
him
he
down
thank
god
for
that
and
pray
god
keep
him
so
him
king
indeed
the
black
nigger
all
which
could
not
have
been
comfortable
for
poor
soulouque
the
royal
party
had
endeavoured
in
the
first
instance
to
take
up
their
quarters
at
this
lady
hotel
or
as
they
are
usually
called
but
the
patriotic
sister
of
seacole
would
listen
to
no
such
proposition
i
wo
keep
a
house
for
black
men
she
said
to
me
as
for
kings
i
would
despise
myself
to
have
a
black
king
as
for
that
black
beast
and
his
black
women
bah
now
this
was
certainly
magnanimous
for
soulouque
would
have
been
prepared
to
pay
well
for
his
accommodation
but
the
ordinary
contempt
which
the
coloured
people
have
for
negroes
was
heightened
in
this
case
by
the
presumption
of
black
royalty
perhaps
also
by
loyalty
queen
victoria
is
my
king
said
seacole
sister
i
must
confess
that
i
endeavoured
to
excite
her
loyalty
rather
than
her
compassion
a
few
friends
were
to
dine
with
me
that
day
and
where
would
have
been
my
turtle
soup
had
soulouque
and
his
suite
taken
possession
of
the
house
the
deposed
tyrant
when
he
left
hayti
published
a
short
manifesto
in
which
he
set
forth
that
he
faustin
the
first
having
been
elected
by
the
free
suffrages
of
his
fellow
countrymen
had
endeavoured
to
govern
them
well
actuated
by
a
pure
love
of
his
country
that
he
had
remained
at
his
post
as
long
as
his
doing
so
had
been
pleasing
to
his
countrymen
but
that
now
having
discovered
by
sure
symptoms
that
his
countrymen
desired
to
see
him
no
longer
on
the
throne
he
voluntarily
and
immediately
abdicated
his
seat
from
henceforth
he
could
only
wish
well
to
the
prosperity
of
hayti
free
suffrages
of
his
people
ah
me
such
farces
strike
us
but
as
farces
when
hayti
and
such
like
lands
are
concerned
but
when
they
come
nearer
to
us
they
are
very
sad
soulouque
is
a
stout
hale
man
apparently
of
or
years
of
age
it
is
difficult
to
judge
of
the
expression
of
a
black
man
face
unless
it
be
very
plainly
seen
but
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
by
no
means
repulsive
he
has
been
i
believe
some
twelve
years
emperor
of
hayti
and
as
he
has
escaped
with
wealth
he
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
unfortunate
chapter
ix
jamaica
the
government
queen
lords
and
commons
with
the
full
paraphernalia
of
triple
readings
adjournments
of
the
house
and
counting
out
prevails
in
jamaica
as
it
does
in
great
britain
by
this
it
will
be
understood
that
there
is
a
governor
representing
the
crown
whose
sanction
or
veto
is
of
course
given
as
regards
important
measures
in
accordance
with
instructions
from
the
colonial
office
the
governor
has
an
executive
committee
which
tallies
with
our
cabinet
it
consists
at
present
of
three
members
one
of
whom
belongs
to
the
upper
house
and
two
to
the
lower
the
governor
may
appoint
a
fourth
member
if
it
so
please
him
these
gentlemen
are
paid
for
their
services
and
preside
over
different
departments
as
do
our
secretaries
of
state
and
there
is
a
most
honourable
privy
council
just
as
we
have
at
home
of
this
latter
the
members
may
or
may
not
support
the
governor
seeing
that
they
are
elected
for
life
the
house
of
lords
is
represented
by
the
legislative
council
this
is
of
course
not
hereditary
but
the
members
sit
for
life
and
are
nominated
by
the
governor
they
are
seventeen
in
number
the
legislative
council
can
of
course
put
a
veto
on
any
bill
the
house
of
assembly
stands
in
the
place
of
the
house
of
commons
it
consists
of
members
two
being
elected
by
nineteen
parishes
and
three
each
by
three
other
parishes
those
namely
which
contain
the
towns
of
kingston
spanish
town
and
port
royal
in
one
respect
this
house
of
commons
falls
short
of
the
privileges
and
powers
of
our
house
at
home
it
can
not
suggest
money
bills
no
honourable
member
can
make
a
proposition
that
so
much
a
year
shall
be
paid
for
such
a
purpose
the
government
did
not
wish
to
be
driven
to
exercise
the
invidious
power
of
putting
repeated
vetos
on
repeated
suggestions
for
expenditure
and
therefore
this
power
has
been
taken
away
but
any
honourable
member
can
bring
before
the
house
a
motion
to
the
effect
that
the
governor
be
recommended
himself
to
propose
by
one
of
the
executive
committee
such
or
such
a
money
bill
and
then
if
the
governor
decline
the
house
can
refuse
to
pass
his
supplies
and
can
play
the
red
devil
with
his
excellency
so
that
it
seems
to
come
pretty
nearly
to
the
same
thing
at
home
in
england
crown
lords
and
commons
really
seem
to
do
very
well
some
may
think
that
the
system
wants
a
little
shove
this
way
some
the
other
reform
may
or
may
not
be
more
or
less
needed
but
on
the
whole
we
are
governed
honestly
liberally
and
successfully
with
at
least
a
greater
share
of
honesty
liberality
and
success
than
has
fallen
to
the
lot
of
most
other
people
each
of
the
three
estates
enjoys
the
respect
of
the
people
at
large
and
a
seat
either
among
the
lords
or
the
commons
is
an
object
of
high
ambition
the
system
may
therefore
be
said
to
be
successful
but
it
does
not
follow
that
because
it
answers
in
england
it
should
answer
in
jamaica
that
institutions
which
suit
the
country
which
is
perhaps
in
the
whole
world
the
furthest
advanced
in
civilization
wealth
and
public
honesty
should
suit
equally
well
an
island
which
is
unfortunately
very
far
from
being
advanced
in
those
good
qualities
whose
civilization
as
regards
the
bulk
of
the
population
is
hardly
above
that
of
savages
whose
wealth
has
vanished
and
of
whose
public
honesty
i
will
say
nothing
of
that
i
myself
will
say
nothing
but
the
jamaicans
speak
of
it
in
terms
which
are
not
flattering
to
their
own
land
i
do
not
think
that
the
system
does
answer
in
jamaica
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
carried
on
there
in
a
manner
very
different
from
that
exercised
in
our
other
colonies
in
jamaica
any
man
may
vote
who
pays
either
tax
or
rent
but
by
a
late
law
he
must
put
in
his
claim
to
vote
on
a
ten
shilling
stamp
there
are
in
round
numbers
three
hundred
thousand
blacks
seventy
thousand
coloured
people
and
fifteen
thousand
white
it
may
therefore
easily
be
seen
in
what
hands
the
power
of
electing
must
rest
now
in
barbados
no
coloured
man
votes
at
all
a
coloured
man
or
negro
is
doubtless
qualified
to
vote
if
he
own
a
freehold
but
then
care
is
taken
that
such
shall
not
own
freeholds
in
trinidad
the
legislative
power
is
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
crown
in
guiana
which
i
look
upon
as
the
best
governed
of
them
all
this
is
very
much
the
case
it
is
not
that
i
would
begrudge
the
black
man
the
right
of
voting
because
he
is
black
or
that
i
would
say
that
he
is
and
must
be
unfit
to
vote
or
unfit
even
to
sit
in
a
house
of
assembly
but
the
amalgamation
as
at
present
existing
is
bad
the
objects
sought
after
by
a
free
and
open
representation
of
the
people
are
not
gained
unless
those
men
are
as
a
rule
returned
who
are
most
respected
in
the
commonwealth
so
that
the
body
of
which
they
are
the
units
may
be
respected
also
this
object
is
not
achieved
in
jamaica
and
consequently
the
house
of
assembly
is
not
respected
it
does
not
contain
the
men
of
most
weight
and
condition
in
the
island
and
is
contemptuously
spoken
of
even
in
jamaica
itself
and
even
by
its
own
members
some
there
are
some
few
who
have
gotten
themselves
to
be
elected
in
order
that
things
which
are
already
bad
may
not
if
such
can
be
avoided
become
worse
they
no
doubt
are
they
who
best
do
their
duty
by
the
country
in
which
their
lot
lies
but
for
the
most
part
those
who
should
represent
jamaica
will
not
condescend
to
take
part
in
the
debates
nor
will
they
solicit
the
votes
of
the
negroes
it
would
appear
from
these
observations
as
though
i
thought
that
the
absolute
ascendency
of
the
white
man
should
still
be
maintained
in
jamaica
by
no
means
let
him
be
ascendant
who
can
in
jamaica
or
elsewhere
who
honestly
can
i
doubt
whether
such
ascendency
the
ascendency
of
europeans
and
white
creoles
can
be
longer
maintained
in
this
island
it
is
not
even
now
maintained
and
for
that
reason
chiefly
i
hold
that
this
system
of
lords
and
commons
is
not
compatible
with
the
present
genius
of
the
place
let
coloured
men
fill
the
public
offices
and
enjoy
the
sweets
of
official
pickings
i
would
by
no
means
wish
to
interfere
with
any
good
things
which
fortune
may
be
giving
them
in
this
respect
but
i
think
there
would
be
greater
probability
of
their
advancing
in
their
new
profession
honestly
and
usefully
if
they
could
be
made
to
look
more
to
the
colonial
office
at
home
and
less
to
the
native
legislature
at
home
no
member
of
the
house
of
commons
can
hold
a
government
contract
the
members
of
the
house
of
assembly
in
jamaica
have
no
such
prejudicial
embargo
attached
to
the
honour
of
their
seats
they
can
hold
the
government
contracts
and
it
is
astonishing
how
many
of
them
are
in
their
hands
the
great
point
which
strikes
a
stranger
is
this
that
the
house
of
assembly
is
not
respected
in
the
island
jamaicans
themselves
have
no
confidence
in
it
if
the
white
men
could
be
polled
the
majority
i
think
would
prefer
to
be
rid
of
it
altogether
and
to
be
governed
as
trinidad
is
governed
by
a
governor
with
a
council
of
course
with
due
power
of
reference
to
the
colonial
office
let
any
man
fancy
what
england
would
be
if
the
house
of
commons
were
ludicrous
in
the
eyes
of
englishmen
if
men
ridiculed
or
were
ashamed
of
all
their
debates
such
is
the
case
as
regards
the
jamaica
house
of
commons
in
truth
there
is
not
room
for
a
machinery
so
complicated
in
this
island
the
handful
of
white
men
can
no
longer
have
it
all
their
own
way
and
as
for
the
negroes
let
any
warmest
advocate
of
the
man
and
brother
position
say
whether
he
has
come
across
three
or
four
of
the
class
who
are
fit
to
enact
laws
for
their
own
guidance
and
the
guidance
of
others
it
pains
me
to
write
words
which
may
seem
to
be
opposed
to
humanity
and
a
wide
philanthropy
but
a
spade
is
a
spade
and
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
say
that
it
is
something
else
the
proof
of
the
truth
of
what
i
say
with
reference
to
this
system
of
lords
and
commons
is
to
be
found
in
the
eating
of
the
pudding
it
may
not
perhaps
be
fair
to
adduce
the
prosperity
of
barbados
and
to
compare
it
with
the
adversity
of
jamaica
seeing
that
local
circumstances
were
advantageous
to
barbados
at
the
times
of
emancipation
and
equalization
of
the
sugar
duties
barbados
was
always
able
to
command
a
plentiful
supply
of
labour
but
it
is
quite
fair
to
compare
jamaica
with
guiana
or
trinidad
in
both
these
colonies
the
negro
was
as
well
able
to
shirk
his
work
as
in
jamaica
and
in
these
two
colonies
the
negro
did
shirk
his
work
just
as
he
did
in
jamaica
and
does
still
to
a
great
extent
the
limits
of
these
colonies
are
as
extensive
as
jamaica
is
and
the
negro
can
squat
they
are
as
fertile
as
jamaica
is
and
the
negro
can
procure
his
food
almost
without
trouble
but
not
the
less
is
it
a
fact
that
the
exportation
of
sugar
from
guiana
and
trinidad
now
exceeds
the
amount
exported
in
the
time
of
slavery
while
the
exportation
from
jamaica
is
almost
as
nothing
but
in
trinidad
and
guiana
they
have
no
house
of
commons
with
speaker
three
readings
motions
for
adjournment
and
unlimited
powers
of
speech
in
those
colonies
the
governments
acting
with
such
assistance
as
was
necessary
have
succeeded
in
getting
foreign
labour
in
jamaica
they
have
as
yet
but
succeeded
in
talking
about
it
in
guiana
and
trinidad
they
make
much
sugar
and
boast
loudly
of
making
more
in
jamaica
they
make
but
very
little
and
have
not
enough
left
with
them
to
make
any
boast
whatsoever
with
all
the
love
that
an
englishman
should
have
for
a
popular
parliamentary
representation
i
can
not
think
it
adapted
to
a
small
colony
even
were
that
colony
not
from
circumstances
so
peculiarly
ill
fitted
for
it
as
is
jamaica
in
canada
and
australia
it
is
no
doubt
very
well
the
spirit
of
a
fresh
and
energetic
people
struggling
on
into
the
world
eminence
will
produce
men
fit
for
debating
men
who
can
stand
on
their
legs
without
making
a
house
of
legislature
ridiculous
but
what
could
lords
and
commons
do
in
malta
or
in
jersey
what
would
they
do
in
the
scilly
islands
what
have
they
been
doing
in
the
ionian
islands
and
alas
what
have
they
done
in
jamaica
her
roads
are
almost
impassable
her
bridges
are
broken
down
her
coffee
plantations
have
gone
back
to
bush
her
sugar
estates
have
been
sold
for
the
value
of
the
kingston
as
a
town
is
the
most
deplorable
that
man
ever
visited
unless
it
be
that
spanish
town
is
worse
and
yet
they
have
lords
and
commons
with
all
but
unlimited
powers
of
making
motions
it
has
availed
them
nothing
and
i
fear
will
avail
them
nothing
this
i
know
may
be
said
that
be
the
lords
and
commons
there
for
good
or
evil
they
are
to
be
moved
neither
by
men
nor
gods
it
is
i
imagine
true
that
no
power
known
to
the
british
empire
could
deprive
jamaica
of
her
constitution
it
has
had
some
kind
of
a
house
of
assembly
since
the
time
of
charles
ii
nay
i
believe
since
the
days
of
cromwell
which
by
successive
doctoring
has
grown
to
be
such
a
parody
as
it
now
is
on
our
home
mode
of
doing
business
how
all
this
may
now
be
altered
and
brought
back
to
reason
perhaps
no
man
can
say
probably
it
can
not
be
altered
till
some
further
smash
shall
come
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
the
less
objectionable
the
house
of
assembly
and
the
chamber
of
the
legislative
council
are
both
situated
in
the
same
square
with
the
governor
mansion
in
spanish
town
the
desolateness
of
this
place
i
have
attempted
to
describe
elsewhere
and
yet
when
i
was
there
parliament
was
sitting
what
must
the
place
be
during
the
nine
months
when
parliament
does
not
sit
they
are
yellow
buildings
erected
at
considerable
expense
and
not
without
some
pretence
but
nevertheless
they
are
ugly
ugly
from
their
colour
ugly
from
the
heat
and
ugly
from
a
certain
heaviness
which
seems
natural
to
them
and
to
the
place
the
house
itself
in
which
the
members
sit
is
comfortable
enough
and
not
badly
adapted
for
its
purposes
the
speaker
sits
at
one
end
all
in
full
fig
with
a
clerk
at
the
table
below
opposite
to
him
down
the
room
a
low
bar
about
four
feet
high
runs
across
it
as
far
as
this
the
public
are
always
admitted
and
when
any
subject
of
special
interest
is
under
discussion
twelve
or
fifteen
persons
may
be
seen
there
assembled
then
there
is
a
side
room
opening
from
the
house
into
which
members
take
their
friends
indeed
it
is
i
believe
generally
open
to
any
one
wearing
a
decent
coat
there
is
the
bellamy
of
the
establishment
in
which
honourable
members
take
such
refreshment
as
the
warmth
of
the
debate
may
render
necessary
their
tastes
seemed
to
me
to
be
simple
and
to
addict
themselves
chiefly
to
rum
and
water
i
was
throwing
away
my
cigar
as
i
entered
the
precincts
of
the
house
oh
you
can
smoke
said
my
friend
to
me
only
when
you
stand
at
the
doorway
do
let
the
speaker
eye
catch
the
light
but
it
wo
much
matter
so
i
walked
on
and
stood
at
the
side
door
smoking
my
cigar
indeed
but
conscious
that
i
was
desecrating
the
place
i
saw
five
or
six
coloured
gentlemen
in
the
house
and
two
negroes
sitting
in
the
house
as
members
as
far
as
the
two
latter
men
were
concerned
i
could
not
but
be
gratified
to
see
them
in
the
fair
enjoyment
of
the
objects
of
a
fair
ambition
had
they
not
by
efforts
of
their
own
made
themselves
greatly
superior
to
others
of
their
race
they
would
not
have
been
there
i
say
this
fearing
that
it
may
be
thought
that
i
begrudge
a
black
man
such
a
position
i
begrudge
the
black
men
nothing
that
they
can
honestly
lay
hands
on
but
i
think
that
we
shall
benefit
neither
them
nor
ourselves
by
attempting
with
a
false
philanthropy
to
make
them
out
to
be
other
than
they
are
the
subject
under
debate
was
a
railway
bill
the
railway
system
is
not
very
extended
in
the
island
but
there
is
a
railway
and
the
talk
was
of
prolonging
it
indeed
the
house
i
believe
had
on
some
previous
occasion
decided
that
it
should
be
prolonged
and
the
present
fight
was
as
to
some
particular
detail
what
that
detail
was
i
did
not
learn
for
the
business
being
performed
was
a
continual
series
of
motions
for
adjournment
carried
on
by
a
victorious
minority
of
three
it
was
clear
that
the
conquered
majority
of
say
thirty
was
very
angry
for
some
reason
appertaining
probably
to
the
tactics
of
the
house
these
thirty
were
exceedingly
anxious
to
have
some
special
point
carried
and
put
out
of
the
way
that
night
but
the
three
were
inexorable
two
of
the
three
spoke
continually
and
ended
every
speech
with
a
motion
for
adjournment
and
then
there
was
a
disagreement
among
the
thirty
some
declared
all
this
to
be
bosh
proposed
to
leave
the
house
without
any
adjournment
play
whist
and
let
the
three
victors
enjoy
their
barren
triumph
others
made
of
sterner
stuff
would
not
thus
give
way
one
after
another
they
made
impetuous
little
speeches
then
two
at
a
time
and
at
last
three
they
thumped
the
table
and
called
each
other
pretty
names
walked
about
furiously
and
devoted
the
three
victors
to
the
infernal
gods
and
then
one
of
the
black
gentlemen
arose
and
made
a
calm
deliberate
little
oration
the
words
he
spoke
were
about
the
wisest
which
were
spoken
that
night
and
yet
they
were
not
very
wise
he
offered
to
the
house
a
few
platitudes
on
the
general
benefit
of
railways
which
would
have
applied
to
any
railway
under
the
sun
saying
that
eggs
and
fowls
would
be
taken
to
market
and
then
he
sat
down
on
his
behalf
i
must
declare
that
there
were
no
other
words
of
such
wisdom
spoken
that
night
but
this
relief
lasted
only
for
three
minutes
after
a
while
two
members
coming
to
the
door
declared
that
it
was
becoming
unbearable
and
carried
me
away
to
play
whist
my
place
is
close
by
said
one
and
if
the
row
becomes
hot
we
shall
hear
it
it
is
dreadful
to
stay
there
with
such
an
object
and
with
the
certainty
of
missing
one
object
after
all
as
i
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
i
went
away
and
played
whist
but
soon
a
storm
of
voices
reached
our
ears
round
the
they
are
hard
at
it
now
said
one
honourable
member
by
the
screech
the
yell
might
have
been
heard
at
kingston
and
no
doubt
was
by
heavens
they
are
at
it
said
another
ha
ha
ha
a
nice
house
of
assembly
is
it
will
they
pitch
into
one
another
i
asked
thinking
of
scenes
of
which
i
had
read
of
in
another
country
and
thinking
also
i
must
confess
that
an
absolute
bodily
scrimmage
on
the
floor
of
the
house
might
be
worth
seeing
they
do
often
do
that
said
my
friend
they
trust
chiefly
to
their
voices
but
there
no
knowing
the
temptation
was
too
much
for
me
so
i
threw
down
my
cards
and
rushed
back
to
the
assembly
when
i
arrived
the
louder
portion
of
the
noise
was
being
made
by
one
gentleman
who
was
walking
round
and
round
the
chamber
swearing
in
a
loud
voice
that
he
would
resign
the
very
moment
the
speaker
was
seated
in
the
chair
for
at
that
time
the
house
was
in
committee
the
louder
portion
of
the
noise
i
say
for
two
other
honourable
members
were
speaking
and
the
rest
were
discussing
the
matter
in
small
parties
shameful
abominable
scandalous
rascally
shouted
the
angry
gentleman
over
and
over
again
as
he
paced
round
and
round
the
chamber
i
not
sit
in
such
a
house
no
man
should
sit
in
such
a
house
by
g
i
resign
as
soon
as
i
see
the
speaker
in
that
chair
sir
come
and
have
a
drink
of
rum
and
water
in
his
angry
wanderings
his
steps
had
brought
him
to
the
door
at
which
i
was
standing
and
these
last
words
were
addressed
to
me
come
and
have
a
drink
of
rum
and
water
and
he
seized
me
with
a
hospitable
violence
by
the
arm
i
did
not
dare
to
deny
so
angry
a
legislator
and
i
drank
the
rum
and
water
then
i
returned
to
my
cards
it
may
be
said
that
nearly
the
same
thing
does
sometimes
occur
in
our
own
house
of
commons
always
omitting
the
threats
of
resignation
and
the
drink
with
us
at
home
a
small
minority
may
impede
the
business
of
the
house
by
adjournments
and
members
sometimes
become
loud
and
angry
but
in
jamaica
the
storm
raged
in
so
small
a
teapot
the
railway
extension
was
to
be
but
for
a
mile
or
two
and
i
fear
would
hardly
benefit
more
than
the
eggs
and
fowls
for
which
the
dark
gentleman
pleaded
in
heading
this
chapter
i
have
spoken
of
the
government
and
it
may
be
objected
to
me
that
in
writing
it
i
have
written
only
of
the
legislature
and
not
at
all
of
the
mode
of
governing
but
in
truth
the
mode
of
government
depends
entirely
on
the
mode
of
legislature
as
regards
the
governor
himself
and
his
ministers
i
do
not
doubt
that
they
do
their
best
but
i
think
that
their
best
might
be
much
better
if
their
hands
were
not
so
closely
tied
by
this
teapot
system
of
queen
lords
and
commons
chapter
cuba
cuba
is
the
largest
and
the
most
westerly
of
the
west
indian
islands
it
is
in
the
shape
of
a
and
with
one
of
its
horns
nearly
lies
across
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
belongs
to
the
spanish
crown
of
which
it
is
by
far
the
most
splendid
appendage
so
much
for
facts
geographical
and
historical
the
journey
from
kingston
to
cien
fuegos
of
which
i
have
said
somewhat
in
my
first
chapter
was
not
completed
under
better
auspices
than
those
which
witnessed
its
commencement
that
perfidious
bark
built
in
the
eclipse
was
bad
to
the
last
and
my
voyage
took
nine
days
instead
of
three
my
humble
stock
of
provisions
had
long
been
all
gone
and
my
patience
was
nearly
at
as
low
an
ebb
then
as
a
finale
the
cuban
pilot
who
took
us
in
hand
as
we
entered
the
port
ran
us
on
shore
just
under
the
spanish
fort
and
there
left
us
from
this
position
it
was
impossible
to
escape
though
the
shore
lay
close
to
us
inasmuch
as
it
is
an
offence
of
the
gravest
nature
to
land
in
those
ports
without
the
ceremony
of
a
visit
from
the
medical
officer
and
no
medical
officer
would
come
to
us
there
and
then
two
of
our
small
crew
had
been
taken
sick
and
we
had
before
us
in
our
eye
all
the
pleasures
of
quarantine
a
man
and
especially
an
author
is
thankful
for
calamities
if
they
be
of
a
tragic
dye
it
would
be
as
good
as
a
small
fortune
to
be
left
for
three
days
without
food
or
water
or
to
run
for
one
life
before
a
black
storm
on
unknown
seas
in
a
small
boat
but
we
had
no
such
luck
as
this
there
was
plenty
of
food
though
it
was
not
very
palatable
and
the
peril
of
our
position
can
not
be
insisted
on
as
we
might
have
thrown
a
baby
on
shore
from
the
vessel
let
alone
a
biscuit
we
did
what
we
could
to
get
up
a
catastrophe
among
the
sharks
by
bathing
off
the
ship
sides
but
even
this
was
in
vain
one
small
shark
we
did
see
but
in
lieu
of
it
eating
us
we
ate
it
in
spite
of
the
popular
prejudice
i
have
to
declare
that
it
was
delicious
but
at
last
i
did
find
myself
in
the
hotel
at
cien
fuegos
and
here
i
must
say
a
word
in
praise
of
the
civility
of
the
spanish
authorities
of
that
town
and
indeed
of
those
gentlemen
generally
wherever
i
chanced
to
meet
them
they
welcome
you
with
easy
courtesy
offer
you
coffee
or
beer
assure
you
at
parting
that
their
whole
house
is
at
your
disposal
and
then
load
you
at
least
they
so
loaded
me
with
cigars
my
friend
said
the
captain
of
the
port
holding
in
his
hand
a
huge
parcel
of
these
articles
each
about
seven
inches
long
i
wish
i
could
do
you
a
service
it
would
make
me
happy
for
ever
if
i
could
truly
serve
you
señor
the
service
you
have
done
me
is
inestimable
in
allowing
me
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
don
but
at
least
accept
these
few
cigars
and
then
he
pressed
the
bundle
into
my
hand
and
pressed
his
own
hand
over
mine
smoke
one
daily
after
dinner
and
when
you
procure
any
that
are
better
do
a
fastidious
old
smoker
the
great
kindness
to
inform
him
where
they
are
to
be
found
this
treasure
to
which
his
fancy
alluded
but
in
the
existence
of
which
he
will
never
believe
i
have
not
yet
discovered
cien
fuegos
is
a
small
new
town
on
the
southern
coast
of
cuba
created
by
the
sugar
trade
and
devoted
of
course
to
commerce
it
is
clean
prosperous
and
quickly
increasing
its
streets
are
lighted
with
gas
while
those
in
the
havana
still
depend
upon
it
has
its
opera
its
governor
house
its
alaméda
its
military
and
public
hospital
its
and
railway
station
and
unless
the
engineers
deceive
themselves
it
will
in
time
have
its
well
it
has
also
that
institution
which
in
the
eyes
of
travellers
ranks
so
much
above
all
others
a
good
and
clean
inn
my
first
object
after
landing
was
to
see
a
slave
sugar
estate
i
had
been
told
in
jamaica
that
to
effect
this
required
some
little
management
that
the
owners
of
the
slaves
were
not
usually
willing
to
allow
strangers
to
see
them
at
work
and
that
the
manufacture
of
sugar
in
cuba
was
as
a
rule
kept
sacred
from
profane
eyes
but
i
found
no
such
difficulty
i
made
my
request
to
an
english
merchant
at
cien
fuegos
and
he
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
proprietor
of
an
estate
some
fifteen
miles
from
the
town
and
by
their
joint
courtesy
i
saw
all
that
i
wished
on
this
property
which
consisted
altogether
of
eighteen
hundred
acres
the
greater
portion
of
which
was
not
yet
under
cultivation
there
were
six
hundred
acres
of
cane
pieces
the
average
year
produce
was
eighteen
hundred
hogsheads
or
three
hogsheads
to
the
acre
the
hogshead
was
intended
to
represent
a
ton
of
sugar
when
it
reached
the
market
but
judging
from
all
that
i
could
learn
it
usually
fell
short
of
it
by
more
than
a
hundredweight
the
value
of
such
a
hogshead
at
cien
fuegos
was
about
pounds
there
were
one
hundred
and
fifty
negro
men
on
the
estate
the
average
cash
value
of
each
man
being
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
most
of
the
men
had
their
wives
in
stating
this
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
either
i
or
my
informant
insist
much
on
the
validity
of
their
marriage
ceremony
any
such
ceremony
was
probably
of
rare
occurrence
during
the
crop
time
at
which
period
my
visit
was
made
and
which
lasts
generally
from
november
till
may
the
negroes
sleep
during
six
hours
out
of
the
have
two
for
their
meals
and
work
for
sixteen
no
difference
is
made
on
sunday
their
food
is
very
plentiful
and
of
a
good
and
strong
description
they
are
sleek
and
fat
and
large
like
brewers
horses
and
with
reference
to
them
as
also
with
reference
to
the
brewers
horses
it
has
probably
been
ascertained
what
amount
of
work
may
be
exacted
so
as
to
give
the
greatest
profit
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
the
labour
of
the
negroes
averages
twelve
hours
a
day
and
one
day
of
rest
in
the
week
is
usually
allowed
to
them
i
was
of
course
anxious
to
see
what
was
the
nature
of
the
coercive
measures
used
with
them
but
in
this
respect
my
curiosity
was
not
indulged
i
can
only
say
that
i
saw
none
and
saw
the
mark
and
signs
of
none
no
doubt
the
whip
is
in
use
but
i
did
not
see
it
the
gentleman
whose
estate
i
visited
had
no
notice
of
our
coming
and
there
was
no
appearance
of
anything
being
hidden
from
us
i
could
not
however
bring
myself
to
inquire
of
him
as
to
their
punishment
the
slaves
throughout
the
island
are
always
as
a
rule
baptized
those
who
are
employed
in
the
town
and
as
household
servants
appear
to
be
educated
in
compliance
with
at
any
rate
the
outward
doctrines
of
the
roman
catholic
church
but
with
the
great
mass
of
the
negroes
those
who
work
on
the
all
attention
to
religion
ends
with
their
baptism
they
have
the
advantage
whatever
it
may
be
of
that
ceremony
in
infancy
and
from
that
time
forth
they
are
treated
as
the
beasts
of
the
stall
from
all
that
i
could
hear
as
well
as
from
what
i
could
see
i
have
reason
to
think
that
regarding
them
as
beasts
they
are
well
treated
their
hours
of
labour
are
certainly
very
long
so
long
as
to
appear
almost
impossible
to
a
european
workman
but
under
the
system
such
as
it
is
the
men
do
not
apparently
lose
their
health
though
no
doubt
they
become
prematurely
old
and
as
a
rule
die
early
the
property
is
too
valuable
to
be
neglected
or
ill
used
the
object
of
course
is
to
make
that
property
pay
and
therefore
a
present
healthy
condition
is
cared
for
but
long
life
is
not
regarded
it
is
exactly
the
same
with
horses
in
this
country
when
all
has
been
said
that
can
be
said
in
favour
of
the
in
cuba
it
comes
to
this
that
he
treats
his
slaves
as
beasts
of
burden
and
so
treating
them
does
it
skilfully
and
with
prudence
the
point
which
most
shocks
an
englishman
is
the
absence
of
all
religion
the
ignoring
of
the
black
man
soul
but
this
perhaps
may
be
taken
as
an
excuse
that
the
white
men
here
ignore
their
own
souls
also
the
roman
catholic
worship
seems
to
be
at
a
lower
ebb
in
cuba
than
almost
any
country
in
which
i
have
seen
it
it
is
singular
that
no
priest
should
even
make
any
effort
on
the
subject
with
regard
to
the
negroes
but
i
am
assured
that
such
is
the
fact
they
do
not
wish
to
do
so
nor
will
they
allow
of
any
one
asking
them
to
make
the
experiment
one
would
think
that
had
there
been
any
truth
or
any
courage
in
them
they
would
have
declared
the
inutility
of
baptism
and
have
proclaimed
that
negroes
have
no
souls
but
there
is
no
truth
in
them
neither
is
there
any
courage
the
works
at
the
cuban
sugar
estate
were
very
different
from
those
i
had
seen
at
jamaica
they
were
on
a
much
larger
scale
in
much
better
order
overlooked
by
a
larger
proportion
of
white
men
with
a
greater
amount
of
skilled
labour
the
evidences
of
capital
were
very
plain
in
cuba
whereas
the
want
of
it
was
frequently
equally
plain
in
our
own
island
not
that
the
planters
in
cuba
are
as
a
rule
themselves
very
rich
men
the
estates
are
deeply
mortgaged
to
the
different
merchants
at
the
different
ports
as
are
those
in
jamaica
to
the
merchants
of
kingston
these
merchants
in
cuba
are
generally
americans
englishmen
germans
spaniards
from
the
american
republics
anything
but
cubans
and
the
are
but
the
who
secure
the
profits
of
the
for
the
merchants
my
friend
at
the
estate
invited
us
to
a
late
breakfast
after
having
shown
me
what
i
came
to
see
you
have
taken
me
so
unawares
said
he
that
we
can
not
offer
you
much
except
a
welcome
well
it
was
not
much
for
cuba
perhaps
a
delicious
soup
made
partly
of
eggs
a
bottle
of
excellent
claret
a
paté
de
foie
gras
some
game
deliciously
dressed
and
half
a
dozen
kinds
of
vegetables
that
was
all
i
had
seen
nothing
among
the
slaves
which
in
any
way
interfered
with
my
appetite
or
with
the
cup
of
coffee
and
cigar
which
came
after
the
little
nothings
above
mentioned
we
then
went
down
to
the
railway
station
it
was
a
peculiar
station
i
was
told
and
the
tickets
could
not
be
paid
for
till
we
reached
cien
fuegos
but
lo
on
arriving
at
cien
fuegos
there
was
nothing
more
to
pay
it
has
all
been
done
said
some
one
to
me
if
one
was
but
convinced
that
those
sleek
fat
smiling
bipeds
were
but
two
legged
beasts
of
burden
and
nothing
more
all
would
have
been
well
at
the
estate
which
we
visited
all
cuba
was
of
course
full
of
the
late
message
from
the
president
of
the
united
states
which
at
the
time
of
my
visit
was
some
two
months
old
there
the
purport
of
what
buchanan
said
regarding
cuba
may
perhaps
be
expressed
as
follows
circumstances
and
destiny
absolutely
require
that
the
united
states
should
be
the
masters
of
that
island
that
we
should
take
it
by
filibustering
or
violence
is
not
in
accordance
with
our
national
genius
it
will
suit
our
character
and
honesty
much
better
that
we
should
obtain
it
by
purchase
let
us
therefore
offer
a
fair
price
for
it
if
a
fair
price
be
refused
that
of
course
will
be
a
casus
belli
spain
will
then
have
injured
us
and
we
may
declare
war
under
these
circumstances
we
should
probably
obtain
the
place
without
purchase
but
let
us
hope
better
things
this
is
what
the
president
has
said
either
in
plain
words
or
by
inference
equally
plain
it
may
easily
be
conceived
with
what
feeling
such
an
announcement
has
been
received
by
spain
and
those
who
hold
spanish
authority
in
cuba
there
is
an
outspoken
insolence
in
the
threat
which
by
a
power
would
itself
have
been
considered
a
cause
for
war
but
spain
is
not
a
power
and
like
the
other
weak
ones
of
the
earth
must
either
perish
or
live
by
adhering
to
and
obeying
those
who
will
protect
her
though
too
ignoble
to
be
strong
she
has
been
too
proud
to
be
obedient
and
as
a
matter
of
course
she
will
go
to
the
wall
a
scrupulous
man
who
feels
that
he
would
fain
regulate
his
course
in
politics
by
the
same
line
as
that
used
for
his
ordinary
life
can
not
but
feel
angry
at
the
loud
tone
of
america
audacious
threat
but
even
such
a
one
knows
that
that
threat
will
sooner
or
later
be
carried
out
and
that
humanity
will
benefit
by
its
accomplishment
perhaps
it
may
be
said
that
scrupulous
men
should
have
but
little
dealing
in
state
policy
the
plea
under
which
buchanan
proposes
to
quarrel
with
spain
if
she
will
not
sell
that
which
america
wishes
to
buy
is
the
plea
under
which
ahab
quarrelled
with
naboth
a
man
is
individually
disgusted
that
a
president
of
the
united
states
should
have
made
such
an
utterance
but
looking
at
the
question
in
a
broader
point
of
view
in
one
which
regards
future
ages
rather
than
the
present
time
one
can
hardly
refrain
from
rejoicing
at
any
event
which
will
tend
to
bring
about
that
which
in
itself
is
so
desirable
we
reprobate
the
name
of
filibuster
and
have
a
holy
horror
of
the
trade
and
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
that
with
us
the
age
of
individual
filibustering
is
gone
by
but
it
may
be
fair
for
us
to
consider
whether
we
have
not
in
our
younger
days
done
as
much
in
this
line
as
have
the
americans
whether
clive
for
instance
was
not
a
filibuster
or
warren
hastings
have
we
not
annexed
and
maintained
and
encroached
protected
and
assumed
and
taken
possession
in
the
east
doing
it
all
of
course
for
the
good
of
humanity
and
why
should
we
begrudge
the
same
career
to
america
that
we
do
begrudge
it
is
certain
that
she
purchased
california
and
took
texas
went
at
first
against
the
grain
with
us
and
englishmen
as
a
rule
would
wish
to
maintain
cuba
in
the
possession
of
spain
but
what
englishman
who
thinks
about
it
will
doubt
that
california
and
texas
have
thriven
since
they
were
annexed
as
they
never
could
have
thriven
while
forming
part
of
the
mexican
empire
or
can
doubt
that
cuba
if
delivered
up
to
the
states
would
gain
infinitely
by
such
a
change
of
masters
filibustering
called
by
that
or
some
other
name
is
the
destiny
of
a
great
portion
of
that
race
to
which
we
englishmen
and
americans
belong
it
would
be
a
bad
profession
probably
for
a
scrupulous
man
with
the
unscrupulous
man
what
there
may
be
between
his
deeds
and
his
conscience
is
for
his
consideration
and
for
judgment
but
it
will
hardly
suit
us
as
a
nation
to
be
loud
against
it
by
what
other
process
have
poor
and
weak
races
been
compelled
to
give
way
to
those
who
have
power
and
energy
and
who
have
displaced
so
many
of
the
poor
and
weak
and
spread
abroad
so
vast
an
energy
such
an
extent
of
power
as
we
of
england
the
truth
may
perhaps
be
this
that
a
filibuster
needs
expect
no
good
word
from
his
till
he
has
proved
his
claim
to
it
by
success
from
such
information
as
i
could
obtain
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
cubans
themselves
would
be
glad
enough
to
see
the
transfer
well
effected
how
indeed
can
it
be
otherwise
at
present
they
have
no
national
privilege
except
that
of
undergoing
taxation
every
office
is
held
by
a
spaniard
every
soldier
in
the
island
and
they
say
that
there
are
thousand
must
be
a
spaniard
the
ships
of
war
are
commanded
and
manned
by
spaniards
all
that
is
shown
before
their
eyes
of
brilliancy
and
power
and
high
place
is
purely
spanish
no
cuban
has
any
voice
in
his
own
country
he
can
never
have
the
consolation
of
thinking
that
his
tyrant
is
his
countryman
or
reflect
that
under
altered
circumstances
it
might
possibly
have
been
his
fortune
to
tyrannize
what
love
can
he
have
for
spain
he
can
not
even
have
the
poor
pride
of
being
slave
to
a
great
lord
he
is
the
lacquey
of
a
reduced
gentleman
and
lives
on
the
vails
of
those
who
despise
his
master
of
course
the
transfer
would
be
grateful
to
him
but
no
cuban
will
himself
do
anything
to
bring
it
about
to
wish
is
one
thing
to
act
is
another
a
man
standing
behind
his
counter
may
feel
that
his
hand
is
restricted
on
every
side
and
his
taxes
alone
unrestricted
but
he
must
have
other
than
blood
in
his
veins
if
he
do
more
than
stand
and
feel
indeed
wishing
is
too
strong
a
word
to
be
fairly
applicable
to
his
state
of
mind
he
would
be
glad
that
cuba
should
be
american
but
he
would
prefer
that
he
himself
should
lie
in
a
dormant
state
while
the
dangerous
transfer
is
going
on
i
have
ventured
to
say
that
humanity
would
certainly
be
benefited
by
such
a
transfer
we
when
we
think
of
cuba
think
of
it
almost
entirely
as
a
slave
country
and
indeed
in
this
light
and
in
this
light
only
is
it
peculiar
being
the
solitary
land
into
which
slaves
are
now
systematically
imported
out
of
africa
into
that
great
question
of
guarding
the
slave
coast
it
would
be
futile
here
to
enter
but
this
i
believe
is
acknowledged
that
if
the
cuban
market
be
closed
against
the
trade
the
trade
must
perish
of
exhaustion
at
present
slaves
are
brought
into
cuba
in
spite
of
us
and
as
we
all
know
can
be
brought
in
under
the
american
stars
and
stripes
but
no
one
accuses
the
american
government
of
systematically
favouring
an
importation
of
africans
into
their
own
states
when
cuba
becomes
one
of
them
the
trade
will
cease
the
obstacle
to
that
trade
which
is
created
by
our
vessels
of
war
on
the
coast
of
africa
may
or
may
not
be
worth
the
cost
but
no
man
who
looks
into
the
subject
will
presume
to
say
that
we
can
be
as
efficacious
there
as
the
americans
would
be
if
they
were
the
owners
of
the
present
i
do
not
know
whether
it
be
sufficiently
understood
in
england
that
though
slavery
is
an
institution
of
the
united
states
the
as
commonly
understood
under
that
denomination
is
as
illegal
there
as
in
england
that
slavery
itself
would
be
continued
in
cuba
under
the
americans
continued
for
a
while
is
of
course
certain
so
is
it
in
louisiana
and
the
carolinas
but
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
the
kidnapping
of
negroes
the
african
wars
which
are
waged
for
the
sake
of
prisoners
would
of
necessity
come
to
an
end
but
this
is
as
opposed
to
the
laws
of
spain
and
its
colonies
as
it
is
to
those
of
the
united
states
or
of
great
britain
this
is
true
and
were
the
law
carried
out
in
cuba
as
well
as
it
is
in
the
united
states
an
englishman
would
feel
disinclined
to
look
on
with
calmness
at
the
violent
dismemberment
of
the
spanish
empire
but
in
cuba
the
law
is
broken
systematically
the
in
cuba
will
allow
no
african
to
be
imported
into
the
island
except
for
a
consideration
it
is
said
that
the
present
receives
only
a
gold
doubloon
or
about
three
pounds
twelve
shillings
on
every
head
of
wool
so
brought
in
and
he
has
therefore
the
reputation
of
being
a
very
moderate
man
required
twice
as
large
a
bribe
valdez
would
take
nothing
and
he
is
spoken
of
as
the
foolish
governor
even
he
though
he
would
take
no
bribe
was
not
allowed
to
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
that
such
a
bribe
is
usually
demanded
and
as
a
matter
of
course
paid
is
as
well
known
ay
much
better
known
than
any
other
of
the
island
port
duties
the
fact
is
so
notorious
to
all
men
that
it
is
almost
as
absurd
to
insist
on
it
as
it
would
be
to
urge
that
the
income
of
the
queen
of
england
is
paid
from
the
taxes
it
is
known
to
every
one
and
among
others
is
known
to
the
government
of
spain
under
these
circumstances
who
can
feel
sympathy
with
her
or
wish
that
she
should
retain
her
colony
does
she
not
daily
show
that
she
is
unfit
to
hold
it
there
must
be
some
stage
in
misgovernment
which
will
justify
the
interference
of
bystanding
nations
in
the
name
of
humanity
that
rule
in
life
which
forbids
a
man
to
come
between
a
husband
and
his
wife
is
a
good
rule
but
nevertheless
who
can
stand
by
quiescent
and
see
a
brute
half
murder
the
poor
woman
whom
he
should
protect
and
in
other
ways
and
through
causes
also
humanity
would
be
benefited
by
such
a
transfer
we
in
england
are
not
very
fond
of
a
republic
we
would
hardly
exchange
our
throne
for
a
chair
or
even
dispense
at
present
with
our
house
of
peers
or
our
bench
of
bishops
but
we
can
see
that
men
thrive
under
the
stars
and
stripes
whereas
they
pine
beneath
the
red
and
yellow
flag
of
spain
this
it
may
be
said
is
attributable
to
the
race
of
the
men
rather
than
to
the
government
but
the
race
will
be
improved
by
the
infusion
of
new
blood
let
the
world
say
what
chance
there
is
of
such
improvement
in
the
spanish
government
the
trade
of
the
country
is
falling
into
the
hands
of
foreigners
into
those
principally
of
americans
from
the
states
the
havana
will
soon
become
as
much
american
as
new
orleans
it
requires
but
little
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
to
foretell
that
the
spanish
rule
will
not
be
long
obeyed
by
such
people
on
the
whole
i
can
not
see
how
englishmen
can
refrain
from
sympathizing
with
the
desire
of
the
united
states
to
become
possessed
of
this
fertile
island
as
far
as
we
ourselves
are
concerned
it
would
be
infinitely
for
our
benefit
we
can
trade
with
the
united
states
when
we
can
hardly
do
so
with
spain
moreover
if
jamaica
and
the
smaller
british
islands
can
ever
again
hold
up
their
heads
against
cuba
as
colonies
it
will
be
when
the
has
been
abolished
till
such
time
it
can
never
be
and
then
where
are
our
professions
for
the
amelioration
and
especially
for
the
christianity
of
the
human
race
i
have
said
what
is
the
religious
education
of
the
slaves
in
cuba
i
may
also
say
that
in
this
island
no
place
of
protestant
worship
exists
or
is
possible
the
roman
catholic
religion
is
alone
allowed
and
that
is
at
its
very
lowest
point
the
old
women
of
both
sexes
go
to
mass
a
spaniard
told
me
and
the
girls
when
their
clothes
are
new
but
above
all
things
it
behoves
us
to
rid
ourselves
of
the
jealousy
which
i
fear
we
too
often
feel
towards
american
pretension
jonathan
is
getting
bumptious
we
are
apt
to
say
he
ought
to
have
this
and
that
other
punishment
according
to
the
taste
of
the
offended
englishman
jonathan
is
becoming
bumptious
no
doubt
young
men
of
genius
when
they
succeed
in
life
at
comparatively
early
years
are
generally
afflicted
more
or
less
with
this
disease
but
one
is
not
inclined
to
throw
aside
as
useless
the
intellect
energy
and
genius
of
youth
because
it
is
not
accompanied
by
modesty
grace
and
do
we
not
in
regard
to
all
our
friends
take
the
good
that
we
find
in
them
aware
that
in
the
very
best
there
will
be
some
deficiency
to
forgive
that
young
barrister
who
is
so
bright
so
energetic
so
useful
is
perhaps
more
than
a
little
one
can
not
deny
it
but
age
will
cure
that
have
we
a
right
to
expect
that
he
should
be
perfect
and
are
the
americans
the
first
bumptious
people
on
record
has
no
other
nation
assumed
itself
to
be
in
advance
of
the
world
to
be
the
apostle
of
progress
the
fountain
of
liberty
the
of
manly
work
if
the
americans
were
not
bumptious
how
unlike
would
they
be
to
the
parent
that
bore
them
the
world
is
wide
enough
for
us
and
for
our
offspring
and
we
may
be
well
content
that
we
have
it
nearly
all
between
us
let
them
fulfil
their
destiny
in
the
west
while
we
do
so
in
the
east
it
may
be
that
there
also
we
may
establish
another
child
who
in
due
time
shall
also
run
alone
shall
also
boast
somewhat
loudly
of
its
own
doings
it
is
a
proud
reflection
that
we
alone
of
all
people
have
such
children
a
proud
reflection
and
a
joyous
one
though
the
weaning
of
the
baby
will
always
be
in
some
respects
painful
to
the
mother
nowhere
have
i
met
a
kinder
hospitality
than
i
did
at
cien
fuegos
whether
from
spaniards
frenchmen
americans
or
englishmen
for
at
cien
fuegos
there
are
men
of
all
these
countries
but
i
must
specify
my
friend
why
should
such
a
man
be
shut
up
for
life
at
such
an
outlandish
place
full
of
wit
singing
an
excellent
song
telling
a
story
better
i
think
than
any
other
man
to
whom
i
have
ever
listened
speaking
four
or
five
languages
fluently
pleasant
in
manner
hospitable
in
heart
a
thorough
good
fellow
at
all
points
why
should
he
bury
himself
at
cien
fuegos
auri
sacra
fames
it
is
the
presumable
reason
for
all
such
burials
english
reader
shouldst
thou
find
thyself
at
cien
fuegos
in
thy
travels
it
will
not
take
thee
long
to
discover
my
friend
he
is
there
known
to
every
one
it
will
only
concern
thee
to
see
that
thou
art
worthy
of
his
acquaintance
from
cien
fuegos
i
went
to
the
havana
the
metropolis
as
all
the
world
knows
of
cuba
our
route
lay
by
steamer
to
batavano
and
thence
by
railway
the
communication
round
cuba
that
is
from
port
to
port
is
not
ill
arranged
or
ill
conducted
the
boats
are
american
built
and
engineered
by
englishmen
or
americans
breakfast
and
dinner
are
given
on
board
and
the
cost
is
included
in
the
sum
paid
for
the
fare
the
provisions
are
plentiful
and
not
bad
if
oil
can
be
avoided
as
everything
is
done
to
foster
spain
spanish
wine
is
always
used
and
spanish
ware
and
above
all
things
spanish
oil
now
spain
does
not
send
her
best
oil
to
her
colonies
i
heard
great
complaint
made
of
the
fares
charged
on
board
these
boats
the
fares
when
compared
with
those
charged
in
america
doubtless
are
high
but
i
do
not
know
that
any
one
has
a
right
to
expect
that
he
shall
travel
as
cheaply
in
cuba
as
in
the
states
i
had
heard
much
of
the
extravagant
charges
made
for
all
kinds
of
accommodation
in
cuba
at
hotels
in
the
shops
for
travelling
for
chance
work
and
the
general
wants
of
a
stranger
i
found
these
statements
to
be
much
exaggerated
railway
travelling
by
the
first
class
is
about
a
mile
which
is
about
a
mile
more
than
in
england
at
hotels
the
charge
is
two
and
a
half
or
three
dollars
a
day
the
former
sum
is
the
more
general
this
includes
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
morning
a
very
serious
meal
at
nine
together
with
fairly
good
catalan
wine
dinner
at
four
with
another
cup
of
coffee
and
more
wine
bed
and
attendance
indeed
a
man
may
go
out
of
his
hotel
without
inconvenience
paying
nothing
beyond
the
regular
daily
charge
extras
are
dear
i
for
instance
having
in
my
ignorance
asked
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
paid
for
it
seventeen
shillings
a
friend
dining
with
one
also
or
breakfasting
is
an
expensive
affair
the
two
together
cost
considerably
more
than
own
total
daily
payment
thus
as
one
pays
at
an
hotel
whether
dinner
be
eaten
or
no
it
becomes
almost
an
insane
expense
for
friends
at
different
hotels
to
invite
each
other
but
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
i
speak
in
praise
of
the
hotels
at
the
havana
far
be
it
from
me
to
do
so
i
only
say
that
they
are
not
dear
i
found
it
impossible
to
command
the
luxury
of
a
bedroom
to
myself
it
was
not
the
custom
of
the
country
they
told
me
if
i
chose
to
pay
five
dollars
a
day
just
double
the
usual
price
i
could
be
indulged
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
admit
of
it
which
was
intended
to
signify
that
they
would
be
happy
to
charge
me
for
the
second
bed
as
soon
as
the
time
should
come
that
they
had
no
one
else
on
whom
to
levy
the
rate
and
the
dirt
of
that
bedroom
i
had
been
unable
to
get
into
either
of
the
hotels
at
the
havana
to
which
i
had
been
recommended
every
corner
in
each
having
been
appropriated
in
my
grief
at
the
dirt
of
my
abode
and
at
the
too
near
vicinity
of
my
spanish
neighbour
the
of
my
chamber
was
from
spain
i
complained
somewhat
bitterly
to
an
american
acquaintance
who
had
as
i
thought
been
more
lucky
in
his
inn
one
companion
said
he
why
i
have
three
one
walks
about
all
night
in
a
a
second
snores
and
the
other
is
dying
a
friend
of
mine
an
english
officer
was
at
another
house
he
also
was
one
of
four
and
it
so
occurred
that
he
lost
thirty
pounds
out
of
his
sac
de
nuit
on
the
whole
i
may
consider
myself
to
have
been
lucky
labour
generally
is
dear
a
workman
getting
a
dollar
or
four
shillings
and
twopence
where
in
england
a
man
might
earn
perhaps
half
a
crown
a
porter
therefore
for
whom
sixpence
might
suffice
in
england
will
require
a
shilling
a
volante
i
shall
have
a
word
to
say
about
volantes
for
any
distance
within
the
walls
costs
eightpence
outside
the
walls
the
price
seems
to
be
unconscionably
higher
omnibuses
which
run
over
two
miles
charge
some
fraction
over
sixpence
for
each
journey
i
find
that
a
pair
of
boots
cost
me
shillings
in
london
they
would
cost
about
the
same
those
procured
in
cuba
however
were
worth
nothing
which
certainly
makes
a
difference
meat
is
eightpence
the
english
pound
bread
is
somewhat
dearer
than
in
england
but
not
much
house
rent
may
be
taken
as
being
nearly
four
times
as
high
as
it
is
in
any
decent
but
not
fashionable
part
of
london
and
the
wages
of
house
servants
are
twice
as
high
as
they
are
with
us
the
high
prices
in
the
havana
are
such
therefore
as
to
affect
the
resident
rather
than
the
stranger
one
article
however
is
very
costly
but
as
it
concerns
a
luxury
not
much
in
general
use
among
the
inhabitants
this
is
not
surprising
if
a
man
will
have
his
linen
washed
he
will
be
made
to
pay
for
it
there
is
nothing
attractive
about
the
town
of
havana
nothing
whatever
to
my
mind
if
we
except
the
harbour
the
streets
are
narrow
dirty
and
foul
in
this
respect
there
is
certainly
much
difference
between
those
within
and
without
the
wall
the
latter
are
wider
more
airy
and
less
vile
but
even
in
them
there
is
nothing
to
justify
the
praises
with
which
the
havana
is
generally
mentioned
in
the
west
indies
it
excels
in
population
size
and
no
doubt
in
wealth
any
other
city
there
but
this
does
not
imply
a
great
eulogium
the
three
principal
public
buildings
are
the
opera
house
the
cathedral
and
the
palace
of
the
the
former
has
been
nearly
knocked
down
by
an
explosion
of
gas
and
is
now
closed
i
believe
it
to
be
an
admirable
model
for
a
house
the
cathedral
is
as
devoid
of
beauty
both
externally
and
internally
as
such
an
edifice
can
be
made
to
describe
such
a
building
would
be
an
absurd
waste
of
time
and
patience
we
all
know
what
is
a
large
roman
catholic
church
built
in
the
worst
taste
and
by
a
combination
of
the
lowest
attributes
of
gothic
and
latin
architecture
the
palace
having
been
built
for
a
residence
does
not
appear
so
utterly
vile
though
it
is
the
child
of
some
similar
father
it
occupies
one
side
of
a
public
square
or
pláza
and
from
its
position
has
a
effect
of
pictures
in
the
havana
there
are
none
of
which
mention
should
be
made
but
the
glory
of
the
havana
is
the
paseo
the
glory
so
called
this
is
the
public
drive
and
fashionable
lounge
of
the
town
the
hyde
park
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
cascine
the
corso
the
alaméda
it
is
for
their
hour
on
the
paseo
that
the
ladies
dress
themselves
and
the
gentlemen
prepare
their
jewelry
it
consists
of
a
road
running
outside
a
portion
of
the
wall
of
the
extent
perhaps
of
half
a
mile
and
ornamented
with
seats
and
avenues
of
trees
as
are
the
boulevards
at
paris
if
it
is
to
be
compared
with
any
other
resort
of
the
kind
in
the
west
indies
it
certainly
must
be
owned
there
is
nothing
like
it
but
a
european
on
first
seeing
it
can
not
understand
why
it
is
so
eulogized
indeed
it
is
probable
that
if
he
first
goes
thither
alone
as
was
the
case
with
me
he
will
pass
over
it
seeking
for
some
other
paseo
but
then
the
glory
of
the
paseo
consists
in
its
volantes
as
one
boasts
that
one
has
swum
in
a
gondola
so
will
one
boast
of
having
sat
in
a
volante
it
is
the
pride
of
cuban
girls
to
appear
on
the
paseo
in
these
carriages
on
the
afternoons
of
holidays
and
sundays
and
there
is
certainly
enough
of
the
picturesque
about
the
vehicle
to
make
it
worthy
of
some
description
it
is
the
most
singular
of
carriages
and
its
construction
is
such
as
to
give
a
flat
contradiction
to
all
an
englishman
preconceived
notions
respecting
the
power
of
horses
the
volante
is
made
to
hold
two
sitters
though
there
is
sometimes
a
low
middle
seat
which
affords
accommodation
to
a
third
lady
we
will
commence
the
description
from
behind
there
are
two
very
huge
wheels
rough
strong
high
thick
and
of
considerable
weight
the
axles
generally
are
not
capped
but
the
nave
shines
with
coarse
polished
metal
supported
on
the
axletree
and
swinging
forward
from
it
on
springs
is
the
body
of
a
cabriolet
such
as
ordinary
cabriolets
used
to
be
with
the
seat
however
somewhat
lower
and
with
much
more
room
for
the
feet
the
back
of
this
is
open
and
generally
a
curtain
hangs
down
over
the
open
space
a
metal
bar
which
is
polished
so
as
to
look
like
silver
runs
across
the
footboard
and
supports
the
feet
the
body
it
must
be
understood
swings
forward
from
these
high
wheels
so
that
the
whole
of
the
weight
instead
of
being
supported
hangs
from
it
then
there
are
a
pair
of
shafts
which
counting
from
the
back
of
the
carriage
to
the
front
where
they
touch
the
horse
at
the
saddle
are
about
fourteen
feet
in
length
they
do
not
go
beyond
the
saddle
or
the
tug
depending
from
the
saddle
in
which
they
hang
from
this
immense
length
it
comes
to
pass
that
there
is
a
wide
interval
exceeding
six
feet
between
the
carriage
and
the
tail
and
it
follows
also
from
the
construction
of
the
machine
that
a
large
portion
of
the
weight
must
rest
on
the
horse
back
in
addition
to
this
the
unfortunate
horse
has
ordinarily
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
rider
for
with
a
volante
your
servant
rides
and
does
not
drive
you
with
the
fashionable
world
on
the
paseo
a
second
horse
is
used
what
we
should
call
an
outrider
and
the
servant
sits
on
this
but
as
regards
those
which
ply
in
the
town
there
is
but
one
horse
how
animals
can
work
beneath
such
a
yoke
was
to
me
unintelligible
the
great
point
in
the
volante
of
fashion
is
the
servant
dress
he
is
always
a
negro
and
generally
a
large
negro
he
wears
a
huge
pair
not
of
boots
for
they
have
no
feet
to
them
of
galligaskins
i
may
call
them
made
of
thick
stiff
leather
but
so
as
to
fit
the
leg
exactly
the
top
of
them
comes
some
nine
inches
above
the
knee
so
that
when
one
of
these
men
is
seen
seated
at
his
ease
the
point
of
his
boot
nearly
touches
his
chin
they
are
fastened
down
the
sides
with
metal
fastenings
and
at
the
bottom
there
is
a
huge
spur
the
usual
dress
of
these
men
over
and
above
their
boots
consists
of
white
breeches
red
jackets
ornamented
with
gold
lace
and
straw
hats
nothing
can
be
more
awkward
and
nothing
more
barbaric
than
the
whole
affair
but
nevertheless
there
is
about
it
a
barbaric
splendour
which
has
its
effect
the
great
length
of
the
equipage
and
the
distance
of
the
horse
from
his
work
is
what
chiefly
strikes
an
englishman
the
carriage
usually
holds
when
on
the
paseo
two
or
three
ladies
their
great
object
evidently
has
been
to
expand
their
dresses
so
that
they
may
group
well
together
and
with
a
good
result
as
regards
colour
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
this
respect
they
are
generally
successful
they
wear
no
when
in
their
carriages
and
indeed
may
generally
be
seen
out
of
doors
with
their
hair
uncovered
though
they
are
of
spanish
descent
the
mantilla
is
unknown
here
nor
could
i
trace
much
similarity
to
spanish
manner
in
other
particulars
the
ladies
do
not
walk
like
spanish
women
at
least
not
like
the
women
of
andalusia
with
whom
one
would
presume
them
to
have
had
the
nearest
connection
the
walk
of
the
andalusian
women
surpasses
that
of
any
other
while
the
cuban
lady
is
not
graceful
in
her
gait
neither
can
they
boast
the
brilliantly
dangerous
beauty
of
seville
in
cuba
they
have
good
eyes
but
rarely
good
faces
the
forehead
and
the
chin
too
generally
recede
leaving
the
nose
with
a
prominence
that
is
not
agreeable
but
as
my
gallantry
has
not
prevented
me
from
speaking
in
this
uncourteous
manner
of
their
appearance
my
honesty
bids
me
add
that
what
they
lack
in
beauty
they
make
up
in
morals
as
compared
with
their
cousins
in
europe
for
travelling
i
should
probably
prefer
the
south
of
spain
but
were
i
doomed
to
look
for
domesticity
in
either
clime
and
god
forbid
that
such
a
doom
should
be
mine
i
might
perhaps
prefer
a
cuban
mother
for
my
children
but
the
volante
is
held
as
very
precious
by
the
cuban
ladies
the
volante
itself
i
mean
the
actual
vehicle
it
is
not
intrusted
as
coaches
are
with
us
to
the
dusty
mercies
of
a
it
is
ordinarily
kept
in
the
hall
and
you
pass
it
by
as
you
enter
the
house
but
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
to
see
it
in
the
as
the
rooms
are
large
and
usually
not
full
of
furniture
it
does
not
look
amiss
there
the
amusements
of
the
cubans
are
not
very
varied
and
are
innocent
in
their
nature
for
the
gambling
as
carried
on
there
i
regard
rather
as
a
business
than
an
amusement
they
greatly
love
dancing
and
have
dances
of
their
own
and
music
of
their
own
which
are
peculiar
and
difficult
to
a
stranger
their
tunes
are
striking
and
very
pretty
they
are
fond
of
music
generally
and
maintain
a
fairly
good
opera
company
at
the
havana
in
the
pláza
there
the
square
namely
in
front
of
the
house
a
military
band
plays
from
eight
to
nine
every
evening
the
place
is
then
thronged
with
people
but
by
far
the
majority
of
them
are
men
it
is
the
custom
at
all
the
towns
in
cuba
for
the
family
when
at
home
to
pass
their
evening
seated
near
the
large
low
open
window
of
their
and
as
these
windows
almost
always
look
into
the
streets
the
whole
internal
arrangement
is
seen
by
every
one
who
passes
these
windows
are
always
protected
by
iron
bars
as
though
they
were
the
windows
of
a
prison
in
other
respects
they
are
completely
open
four
chairs
are
to
be
seen
ranged
in
a
row
and
four
more
opposite
to
them
running
from
the
window
into
the
room
and
placed
close
together
between
these
is
generally
laid
a
small
piece
of
carpet
the
majority
of
these
chairs
are
made
to
rock
for
the
creole
lady
always
rocks
herself
i
have
watched
them
going
through
the
accustomed
motion
with
their
bodies
even
when
seated
on
chairs
with
stern
immovable
legs
this
is
the
usual
evening
of
the
family
and
i
never
yet
saw
an
occupant
of
one
of
these
chairs
with
a
book
in
her
hand
or
in
his
i
asked
an
englishman
a
resident
in
the
havana
whether
he
had
ever
done
so
a
book
he
answered
why
the
girls
ca
read
in
your
sense
of
the
word
reading
the
young
men
and
many
of
those
who
are
no
longer
young
spend
their
evenings
and
apparently
a
large
portion
of
their
days
in
eating
ices
and
playing
billiards
the
accommodation
in
the
havana
for
these
amusements
is
on
a
very
large
scale
the
harbour
at
the
havana
is
an
interesting
sight
it
is
in
the
first
place
very
picturesque
which
to
the
ordinary
visitor
is
the
most
important
feature
but
it
is
also
commodious
large
and
safe
it
is
approached
between
two
forts
that
to
the
westward
which
is
the
principal
defence
is
called
the
morro
here
also
stands
the
lighthouse
no
englishman
omits
to
hear
as
he
enters
the
harbour
that
these
forts
were
taken
by
the
english
in
albemarle
time
now
it
seems
to
me
they
might
very
easily
be
taken
by
any
one
who
chose
to
spend
on
them
the
necessary
amount
of
gunpowder
but
then
i
know
nothing
about
forts
this
special
one
of
the
morro
i
did
take
not
by
gunpowder
but
by
stratagem
i
was
informed
that
no
one
was
allowed
to
see
it
since
the
open
defiance
of
the
island
contained
in
the
last
message
of
the
united
states
president
but
i
was
also
informed
whisperingly
in
the
ear
that
a
request
to
see
the
lighthouse
would
be
granted
and
that
as
i
was
not
an
american
the
fort
should
follow
it
resulted
in
a
little
black
boy
taking
me
over
the
whole
edifice
an
impudent
little
black
boy
who
filled
his
pockets
with
stones
and
pelted
the
sentries
the
view
of
the
harbour
from
the
lighthouse
is
very
good
quite
worth
the
trouble
of
the
visit
the
fort
itself
i
did
not
understand
but
a
young
english
officer
who
was
with
me
it
as
a
thing
of
nothing
but
then
young
english
officers
everything
here
again
i
must
add
that
nothing
can
exceed
the
courtesy
of
all
spanish
officials
if
they
could
only
possess
honesty
and
energy
as
well
as
courtesy
by
far
the
most
interesting
spot
in
the
havana
is
the
quay
to
which
the
vessels
are
fastened
the
bow
usually
lying
against
the
quay
in
other
places
the
side
of
the
vessel
is
i
believe
brought
to
the
wharf
here
there
are
signs
of
true
life
one
can
not
but
think
how
those
quays
would
be
extended
and
that
life
increased
if
the
place
were
in
the
hands
of
other
people
i
have
said
that
i
regarded
gambling
in
cuba
not
as
an
amusement
but
an
occupation
the
public
lotteries
offer
the
daily
means
to
every
one
for
gratifying
this
passion
they
are
maintained
by
the
government
and
afford
a
profit
i
am
told
of
something
over
a
million
dollars
per
annum
in
all
public
places
tickets
are
hawked
about
one
may
buy
a
whole
ticket
half
a
quarter
an
eighth
or
a
sixteenth
it
is
done
without
any
disguise
or
shame
and
the
institution
seemed
i
must
say
to
be
as
popular
with
the
europeans
living
there
as
with
the
natives
in
the
eyes
of
an
englishman
new
from
great
britain
with
his
prejudices
still
thick
upon
him
this
great
national
feature
loses
some
of
its
nobility
and
grandeur
this
together
with
the
bribery
which
is
so
universal
shows
what
is
the
spirit
of
the
country
for
a
government
supported
by
the
profits
of
a
and
for
a
governor
enriched
by
bribes
on
slaves
illegally
imported
what
englishman
can
feel
sympathy
i
would
fain
hope
that
there
is
no
such
sympathy
felt
in
england
i
have
been
answered
when
expressing
indignation
at
the
system
by
a
request
that
i
would
first
look
at
home
and
have
been
so
answered
by
englishmen
how
can
you
blame
the
they
have
said
when
the
same
thing
is
done
by
the
french
and
english
consuls
through
the
islands
that
the
french
and
english
consuls
do
take
bribes
to
wink
at
the
importation
of
slaves
i
can
not
and
do
not
believe
but
cæsar
wife
should
not
even
be
suspected
i
found
it
difficult
to
learn
what
is
exactly
the
present
population
of
cuba
i
believe
it
to
be
about
and
of
this
number
about
are
slaves
there
are
many
chinese
now
in
the
island
employed
as
household
servants
or
on
railways
or
about
the
many
are
also
kept
at
work
on
the
though
it
seems
that
for
this
labour
they
have
hardly
sufficient
strength
these
unfortunate
deluded
creatures
receive
i
fear
very
little
better
treatment
than
the
slaves
my
best
wish
for
the
island
is
that
it
may
speedily
be
reckoned
among
the
annexations
of
the
united
states
chapter
xi
the
passage
of
the
windward
islands
in
the
good
old
days
when
men
called
things
by
their
proper
names
those
islands
which
run
down
in
a
string
from
north
to
south
from
the
virgin
islands
to
the
mouth
of
the
orinoco
river
were
called
the
windward
islands
the
windward
or
caribbean
islands
they
were
also
called
the
lesser
antilles
the
leeward
islands
were
and
properly
speaking
are
another
cluster
lying
across
the
coast
of
venezuela
of
which
curaçoa
is
the
chief
oruba
and
margarita
also
belong
to
this
lot
among
which
england
i
believe
never
owned
any
greater
antilles
are
cuba
jamaica
hayti
and
porto
rico
though
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
porto
rico
does
not
more
properly
belong
to
the
virgin
islands
the
scattered
assemblage
to
the
north
of
the
greater
antilles
are
the
bahamas
at
one
of
the
least
considerable
of
which
san
salvador
columbus
first
landed
those
now
named
i
believe
comprise
all
the
west
india
islands
but
we
britishers
are
not
content
to
let
the
dutch
and
others
keep
a
separate
name
for
themselves
we
have
therefore
divided
the
lesser
antilles
of
which
the
greater
number
belong
to
ourselves
and
call
the
northern
portion
of
these
the
leeward
islands
among
them
antigua
is
the
chief
and
is
the
residence
of
a
governor
supreme
in
this
division
after
leaving
thomas
the
first
island
seen
of
any
note
is
christopher
commonly
known
as
kitts
and
nevis
is
close
to
it
both
these
colonies
are
prospering
fairly
sugar
is
exported
now
i
am
told
in
increasing
though
still
not
in
great
quantities
and
the
appearance
of
the
cultivation
is
good
looking
up
the
side
of
the
hills
one
sees
the
apparently
in
cleanly
order
and
they
have
an
air
of
substantial
comfort
of
course
the
times
are
not
so
bright
as
in
the
fine
old
days
previous
to
emancipation
but
nevertheless
matters
have
been
on
the
mend
and
people
are
again
beginning
to
get
along
on
the
journey
from
nevis
to
antigua
montserrat
is
sighted
and
a
singular
called
the
redonda
is
seen
very
plainly
montserrat
i
am
told
is
not
prospering
so
well
as
kitts
or
nevis
these
islands
are
not
so
beautiful
not
so
greenly
beautiful
as
are
those
further
south
to
which
we
shall
soon
come
the
mountains
of
nevis
are
certainly
fine
as
they
are
seen
from
the
sea
but
they
are
not
or
do
not
seem
to
be
covered
with
that
delicious
tropical
growth
which
is
so
lovely
in
jamaica
and
trinidad
and
indeed
in
many
of
the
smaller
islands
antigua
is
the
next
going
southward
this
was
and
perhaps
is
an
island
of
some
importance
it
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
of
the
west
indian
colonies
which
itself
advocated
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
to
have
been
the
only
one
which
adopted
complete
emancipation
at
once
without
any
intermediate
system
of
apprenticeship
antigua
has
its
own
bishop
whose
diocese
includes
also
such
of
the
virgin
islands
as
belong
to
us
and
the
adjacent
islands
of
kitts
nevis
and
montserrat
neither
is
antigua
remarkable
for
its
beauty
it
is
approached
however
by
an
excellent
and
picturesque
harbour
called
english
harbour
which
in
former
days
was
much
used
by
the
british
navy
indeed
i
believe
it
was
at
one
time
the
of
a
naval
station
premising
in
the
first
place
that
i
know
very
little
about
harbours
i
would
say
that
nothing
could
be
more
secure
than
that
whether
or
no
it
may
be
easy
for
sailing
vessels
to
get
in
and
out
with
certain
winds
that
indeed
may
be
doubtful
john
the
capital
of
antigua
is
twelve
miles
from
english
harbour
i
was
in
the
island
only
three
or
four
hours
and
did
not
visit
it
i
am
told
that
it
is
a
good
town
or
city
i
should
rather
say
now
that
it
has
its
own
bishop
in
all
these
islands
they
have
queen
lords
and
commons
in
one
shape
or
another
it
may
however
be
hoped
and
i
believe
trusted
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
communities
matters
chiefly
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
first
of
the
three
powers
the
other
members
of
the
legislature
if
they
have
in
them
anything
of
wisdom
to
say
have
doubtless
an
opportunity
of
saying
it
perhaps
also
an
opportunity
when
they
have
nothing
of
wisdom
let
us
trust
however
that
such
opportunities
are
limited
after
leaving
antigua
we
come
to
the
french
island
of
guadaloupe
and
then
passing
dominica
of
which
i
will
say
a
word
just
now
to
martinique
which
is
also
french
and
here
we
are
among
the
rich
green
wild
beauties
of
these
thrice
beautiful
caribbean
islands
the
mountain
grouping
of
both
these
islands
is
very
fine
and
the
hills
are
covered
up
to
their
summits
with
growth
of
the
greenest
at
both
these
islands
one
is
struck
with
the
great
superiority
of
the
french
west
indian
towns
to
those
which
belong
to
us
that
in
guadaloupe
is
called
basseterre
and
the
capital
of
martinique
is
pierre
these
towns
offer
remarkable
contrasts
to
roseau
and
port
castries
the
chief
towns
in
the
adjacent
english
islands
of
dominica
and
lucia
at
the
french
ports
one
is
landed
at
excellently
contrived
little
piers
with
proper
apparatus
for
lighting
and
steps
the
quays
are
shaded
by
trees
the
streets
are
neat
and
in
good
order
and
the
shops
show
that
ordinary
trade
is
thriving
there
are
water
conduits
with
clear
streams
through
the
towns
and
every
thing
is
i
must
tell
a
very
different
tale
when
i
come
to
speak
of
dominica
and
lucia
the
reason
for
this
is
i
think
well
given
in
a
useful
guide
to
the
west
indies
published
some
years
since
under
the
direction
of
the
royal
mail
company
speaking
of
pierre
in
martinique
the
author
says
the
streets
are
neat
regular
and
cleanly
the
houses
are
high
and
have
more
the
air
of
european
houses
than
those
of
the
english
colonies
some
of
the
streets
have
an
avenue
of
trees
which
overshadow
the
footpath
and
on
either
side
are
deep
gutters
down
which
the
water
flows
there
are
five
booksellers
houses
and
the
fashions
are
well
displayed
in
other
shops
the
french
colonists
whether
or
french
consider
the
west
indies
as
their
country
they
cast
no
wistful
looks
towards
france
they
marry
educate
and
build
in
and
for
the
west
indies
and
for
the
west
indies
alone
in
our
colonies
it
is
different
they
are
considered
more
as
temporary
to
be
deserted
as
soon
as
the
occupiers
have
made
money
enough
by
molasses
and
sugar
to
return
should
be
understood
that
a
creole
is
a
person
born
in
the
west
indies
of
a
race
not
indigenous
to
the
islands
there
may
be
white
creoles
coloured
creoles
or
black
creoles
people
talk
of
creole
horses
and
creole
poultry
those
namely
which
have
not
been
themselves
imported
but
which
have
been
bred
from
imported
stock
the
meaning
of
the
word
creole
is
i
think
sometimes
misunderstood
all
this
is
quite
true
there
is
something
very
cheering
to
an
english
heart
in
that
sound
and
reference
to
the
word
home
in
that
great
disinclination
to
the
idea
of
banishment
but
nevertheless
the
effect
as
shown
in
these
islands
is
not
satisfactory
to
the
of
an
englishman
and
it
is
not
only
in
the
outward
appearance
of
things
that
the
french
islands
excel
those
belonging
to
england
which
i
have
specially
named
dominica
and
lucia
export
annually
about
hogsheads
of
sugar
each
martinique
exports
about
hogsheads
martinique
is
certainly
rather
larger
than
either
of
the
other
two
but
size
has
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
is
anything
rather
than
want
of
fitting
soil
which
makes
the
produce
of
sugar
so
inconsiderable
in
dominica
and
lucia
these
french
islands
were
first
discovered
by
the
spaniards
but
since
that
time
they
as
well
as
the
two
english
islands
above
named
have
passed
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
english
and
french
till
it
was
settled
in
that
martinique
and
guadaloupe
should
belong
to
france
and
dominica
and
lucia
with
some
others
to
england
it
certainly
seems
that
france
knew
how
to
take
care
of
herself
in
the
arrangement
there
is
another
little
island
belonging
to
france
at
the
back
of
guadaloupe
to
the
westward
called
but
i
believe
it
is
but
of
little
value
to
my
mind
dominica
as
seen
from
the
sea
is
by
far
the
most
picturesque
of
all
these
islands
indeed
it
would
be
difficult
to
beat
it
either
in
colour
or
grouping
it
fills
one
with
an
ardent
desire
to
be
off
and
rambling
among
those
green
mountains
as
if
one
could
ramble
through
such
wild
bush
country
or
ramble
at
all
with
the
thermometer
at
but
when
one
has
only
to
think
of
such
things
without
any
idea
of
doing
them
neither
the
bushes
nor
the
thermometer
are
considered
one
is
landed
at
dominica
on
a
beach
if
the
water
be
quiet
one
gets
out
dryshod
by
means
of
a
strong
jump
if
the
surf
be
high
one
wades
through
it
if
it
be
very
high
one
is
of
course
upset
the
same
things
happen
at
jacmel
in
hayti
but
then
englishmen
look
on
the
haytians
as
an
uncivilized
barbarous
race
seeing
that
dominica
lies
just
between
martinique
and
guadaloupe
the
difference
between
the
english
beach
and
surf
and
the
french
piers
is
the
more
remarkable
and
then
the
perils
of
the
surf
being
passed
one
walks
into
the
town
of
roseau
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
distressing
sight
every
house
is
in
a
state
of
decadence
there
are
no
shops
that
can
properly
be
so
called
the
people
wander
about
chattering
idle
and
listless
the
streets
are
covered
with
thick
rank
grass
there
is
no
sign
either
of
money
made
or
of
money
making
everything
seems
to
speak
of
desolation
apathy
and
ruin
there
is
nothing
even
in
jamaica
so
sad
to
look
at
as
the
town
of
roseau
the
greater
part
of
the
population
are
french
in
manner
religion
and
language
and
one
would
be
so
glad
to
attribute
to
that
fact
this
wretched
look
of
apathetic
poverty
if
it
were
only
possible
but
we
can
not
do
that
after
visiting
martinique
and
guadaloupe
it
might
be
said
that
a
french
people
will
not
thrive
under
british
rule
but
if
so
what
of
trinidad
this
look
of
misery
has
been
attributed
to
a
great
fire
which
occurred
some
eighty
years
since
but
when
due
industry
has
been
at
work
great
fires
have
usually
produced
improved
towns
now
eighty
years
have
afforded
ample
time
for
such
improvement
if
it
were
forthcoming
alas
it
would
seem
that
it
is
not
forthcoming
it
must
however
be
stated
in
fairness
that
dominica
produces
more
coffee
than
sugar
and
that
the
coffee
estates
have
latterly
been
the
most
thriving
singularly
enough
her
best
customer
has
been
the
neighbouring
french
island
of
martinique
in
which
some
disease
has
latterly
attacked
the
coffee
plants
we
then
reach
lucia
which
is
also
very
lovely
as
seen
from
the
sea
this
too
is
an
island
french
in
its
language
manners
and
religion
perhaps
more
entirely
so
than
any
other
of
the
islands
belonging
to
ourselves
the
laws
even
are
still
french
and
the
people
are
i
believe
blessed
with
no
lords
and
commons
if
i
understand
the
matter
rightly
lucia
is
held
as
a
colony
or
possession
conquered
from
the
french
and
is
governed
therefore
by
a
governor
with
the
aid
of
a
council
it
is
however
in
some
measure
dependent
on
the
governor
of
barbados
who
is
again
one
of
your
supreme
governors
there
has
i
believe
been
some
recent
change
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
understand
if
these
changes
be
not
completed
and
if
it
would
not
be
presumptuous
in
me
to
offer
a
word
of
advice
i
would
say
that
in
the
present
state
of
the
island
with
a
population
who
do
little
or
nothing
it
might
be
as
well
to
have
as
much
as
possible
of
the
queen
and
as
little
as
possible
of
the
lords
and
commons
to
the
outward
physical
eye
lucia
is
not
so
triste
as
dominica
there
is
good
landing
there
and
the
little
town
of
castries
though
anything
but
prosperous
in
itself
is
prosperous
in
appearance
as
compared
with
roseau
lucia
is
peculiarly
celebrated
for
its
snakes
one
can
not
walk
ten
yards
off
the
road
so
one
is
told
without
being
bitten
and
if
one
be
bitten
death
is
certain
except
by
the
interposition
of
a
single
individual
of
the
island
who
will
cure
the
sufferer
for
a
consideration
such
at
least
is
the
report
made
on
this
matter
the
first
question
one
should
ask
on
going
there
is
as
to
the
whereabouts
and
usual
terms
of
that
worthy
and
useful
practitioner
there
is
i
believe
a
great
deal
that
is
remarkable
to
attract
the
visitor
among
the
mountains
and
valleys
of
lucia
and
then
in
the
usual
course
running
down
the
island
one
goes
to
that
british
advanced
post
barbados
barbados
that
lies
out
to
windward
guarding
the
other
islands
as
it
were
barbados
that
is
and
ever
was
entirely
british
barbados
that
makes
money
and
is
in
all
respects
so
respectable
a
little
island
king
george
need
not
have
feared
at
all
nor
yet
need
queen
victoria
if
anything
goes
wrong
in
england
napoleon
coming
there
not
to
kiss
her
majesty
this
time
but
to
make
himself
less
agreeable
let
her
majesty
come
to
barbados
and
she
will
be
safe
i
have
said
that
jamaica
never
boasts
and
have
on
that
account
complained
of
her
let
such
complaint
be
far
from
me
when
i
speak
of
barbados
but
shall
i
not
write
a
distinct
chapter
as
to
this
most
respectable
little
island
an
island
that
pays
its
way
vincent
is
the
next
in
our
course
and
this
too
is
green
and
pretty
and
tempting
to
look
at
here
also
the
french
have
been
in
possession
but
comparatively
for
a
short
time
in
settling
this
island
the
chief
difficulty
the
english
had
was
with
the
old
native
indians
who
more
than
once
endeavoured
to
turn
out
their
british
masters
the
contest
ended
in
their
being
effectually
turned
out
by
those
british
masters
who
expelled
them
all
bodily
to
the
island
of
ruatan
in
the
bay
of
honduras
where
their
descendants
are
now
giving
the
diplomatists
so
much
trouble
in
deciding
whose
subjects
they
truly
are
may
we
not
say
that
having
got
rid
of
them
out
of
vincent
we
can
afford
to
get
rid
of
them
altogether
kingston
is
the
capital
here
it
looks
much
better
than
either
roseau
or
castries
though
by
no
means
equal
to
basseterre
or
pierre
this
island
is
said
to
be
healthy
having
in
this
respect
a
much
better
reputation
than
its
neighbour
lucia
and
as
far
as
i
could
learn
it
is
progressing
progressing
slowly
but
progressing
in
spite
even
of
the
burden
of
queens
lords
and
commons
the
lords
and
commons
are
no
doubt
considerably
modified
by
official
influence
and
then
the
traveller
runs
down
the
grenadines
a
petty
cluster
of
islands
lying
between
vincent
and
grenada
of
which
becquia
and
cariacou
are
the
chief
they
have
no
direct
connection
with
the
mail
steamers
but
are
i
believe
under
the
governor
of
barbados
they
are
very
pretty
though
not
as
a
rule
very
productive
of
one
of
them
i
was
told
that
the
population
were
all
females
what
a
paradise
of
houris
if
it
were
but
possible
to
find
a
good
mahommedan
in
these
degenerate
days
grenada
will
be
the
last
upon
the
list
for
i
did
not
visit
or
even
see
tobago
and
of
trinidad
i
have
ventured
to
write
a
separate
chapter
in
spite
of
the
shortness
of
my
visit
grenada
is
also
very
lovely
and
is
i
think
the
of
the
world
for
fruit
the
finest
mangoes
i
ever
ate
i
found
there
and
i
think
the
finest
oranges
and
pine
apples
the
town
of
georges
the
capital
must
at
one
time
have
been
a
place
of
considerable
importance
and
even
now
it
has
a
very
different
appearance
from
those
that
i
have
just
mentioned
it
is
more
like
a
goodly
english
town
than
any
other
that
i
saw
in
any
of
the
smaller
british
islands
it
is
well
built
though
built
up
and
down
steep
hills
and
contains
large
and
comfortable
houses
the
also
looks
like
a
and
there
are
shops
in
it
in
which
trade
is
apparently
carried
on
and
money
made
indeed
grenada
was
once
a
prince
among
these
smaller
islands
having
other
islands
under
it
with
a
governor
supreme
instead
of
tributary
it
was
fertile
also
and
productive
in
every
way
of
importance
but
now
here
as
in
so
many
other
spots
among
the
west
indies
we
are
driven
to
exclaim
ichabod
the
glory
of
our
grenada
has
departed
as
has
the
glory
of
its
great
namesake
in
the
old
world
the
houses
though
so
goodly
are
but
as
so
many
alhambras
whose
tenants
now
are
by
no
means
great
in
the
world
esteem
all
the
hotels
in
the
west
indies
are
as
i
have
said
or
shall
say
in
some
other
place
kept
by
ladies
of
colour
in
the
most
part
by
ladies
who
are
no
longer
very
young
they
are
generally
called
familiarly
by
their
double
name
betsy
austen
for
instance
and
caroline
lee
i
went
to
the
house
of
some
such
lady
in
georges
and
she
told
me
a
woful
tale
of
her
miseries
she
was
kitty
something
i
think
soon
apparently
to
become
kitty
of
another
world
an
hotel
she
said
no
she
kept
no
hotel
what
use
was
there
for
an
hotel
in
georges
she
kept
a
though
for
the
matter
of
that
no
lodgers
ever
came
nigh
her
that
little
granddaughter
of
hers
sometimes
sold
a
bottle
of
ginger
beer
that
was
all
it
must
be
hard
for
living
eyes
to
see
one
trade
die
off
in
that
way
there
is
a
feminine
accomplishment
so
much
in
vogue
among
the
ladies
of
the
west
indies
one
practised
there
with
a
success
so
specially
brilliant
as
to
make
it
deserving
of
special
notice
this
art
is
one
not
wholly
confined
to
ladies
although
as
in
the
case
with
music
dancing
and
cookery
it
is
to
be
looked
for
chiefly
among
the
female
sex
men
indeed
do
practise
it
in
england
the
west
indies
and
elsewhere
and
as
thalberg
and
soyer
are
greatest
among
pianists
and
cooks
so
perhaps
are
the
greatest
adepts
in
this
art
to
be
found
among
the
male
practitioners
elsewhere
that
is
than
in
the
west
indies
there
are
to
be
found
ladies
never
equalled
in
this
art
by
any
effort
of
manhood
i
speak
of
the
science
of
flirting
and
be
it
understood
that
here
among
these
happy
islands
no
idea
of
impropriety
perhaps
remembering
some
of
our
starched
people
at
home
i
should
say
criminality
is
attached
to
the
pursuit
young
ladies
flirt
as
they
dance
and
play
or
eat
and
drink
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
there
is
no
undutiful
unfilial
idea
of
waiting
till
mamma
back
be
turned
no
uncomfortable
fear
of
papa
no
longing
for
secluded
corners
so
that
the
world
should
not
see
the
doing
of
anything
that
one
is
ashamed
of
is
bad
but
as
regards
flirting
there
is
no
such
doing
in
the
west
indies
girls
flirt
not
only
with
the
utmost
skill
but
with
the
utmost
innocence
also
fanny
grey
with
her
twelve
admirers
required
no
retired
corners
no
place
apart
from
father
mother
brothers
or
sisters
she
would
perform
with
all
the
world
around
her
as
some
other
girl
would
sing
conscious
that
in
singing
she
would
neither
disgrace
herself
nor
her
masters
it
may
be
said
that
the
practice
of
this
accomplishment
will
often
interfere
with
the
course
of
true
love
perhaps
so
but
i
doubt
whether
it
does
not
as
often
assist
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
young
ladies
do
not
hang
on
hand
in
the
west
indies
marriages
are
made
up
there
with
apparently
great
satisfaction
on
both
sides
and
then
the
flirting
is
laid
aside
put
by
at
any
rate
till
the
days
of
widowhood
should
such
evil
days
come
the
flirting
is
as
innocent
as
it
is
open
and
is
confined
to
ladies
without
husbands
it
is
confined
to
ladies
without
husbands
but
the
victims
are
not
bachelors
alone
no
position
or
age
or
state
of
health
secures
a
man
from
being
drawn
now
into
one
and
now
into
another
circean
circle
in
which
he
is
whirled
about
sometimes
in
a
most
ridiculous
manner
jostled
amongst
a
dozen
neighbours
left
without
power
to
get
out
or
to
plunge
further
in
pulled
back
by
a
skirt
at
any
attempt
to
escape
repulsed
in
the
front
at
every
struggle
made
to
fight
his
way
through
rolling
about
in
these
charybdis
pools
are
perhaps
oftenest
to
be
seen
certain
wearers
of
red
coats
wretches
girt
with
tight
sashes
and
with
gilding
on
their
legs
and
backs
to
and
fro
they
go
bumping
against
each
other
without
serious
injury
but
apparently
in
great
discomfort
and
then
there
are
strugglers
with
white
very
valiant
in
their
first
efforts
but
often
to
be
seen
in
deep
grief
with
heads
thoroughly
submersed
and
you
may
see
sufferers
with
short
necks
making
little
useless
puffs
puffs
which
would
be
so
impotent
were
not
circe
merciful
to
those
sufferers
if
there
were
as
perhaps
there
should
be
a
college
in
the
west
indies
with
fellowships
and
professorships
established
with
the
view
of
rewarding
proficiency
in
this
science
fanny
grey
should
certainly
be
elected
warden
or
principal
or
provost
of
that
college
her
wondrous
skill
deserves
more
than
mere
praise
more
than
such
slight
glory
as
my
ephemeral
pages
can
give
her
pretty
laughing
brilliant
clever
fanny
grey
whose
cheeks
ever
were
so
pink
whose
teeth
so
white
whose
eyes
so
bright
whose
curling
locks
so
raven
black
and
then
who
ever
smiled
as
she
smiled
or
frowned
as
she
can
frown
sharply
go
those
brows
together
and
down
beneath
the
gurgling
pool
sinks
the
head
of
the
wretch
while
with
momentary
joy
up
pops
the
head
of
another
who
is
received
with
a
momentary
smile
yes
oh
my
reader
it
is
too
true
i
also
have
been
in
that
pool
making
indeed
no
wilful
struggles
attempting
no
leander
feat
of
swimming
sucked
in
as
my
steps
unconsciously
strayed
too
near
the
dangerous
margin
sucked
in
and
then
buffeted
about
not
altogether
unmercifully
when
my
inaptitude
for
such
struggling
was
discovered
yes
i
have
found
myself
choking
in
those
charybdis
waters
have
glanced
into
the
circe
cave
i
have
been
seen
in
my
insane
struggles
but
what
shame
of
that
all
around
me
from
the
old
patriarch
dean
of
the
island
to
the
last
subaltern
fresh
from
chatham
were
there
as
well
as
i
chapter
xii
british
guiana
when
i
settle
out
of
england
and
take
to
the
colonies
for
good
and
all
british
guiana
shall
be
the
land
of
my
adoption
if
i
call
it
demerara
perhaps
i
shall
be
better
understood
at
home
there
are
prejudices
against
it
i
know
they
say
that
it
is
a
low
swampy
muddy
strip
of
alluvial
soil
infested
with
rattlesnakes
gallinippers
and
musquitoes
as
big
as
that
yellow
fever
rages
there
perennially
that
the
heat
is
unendurable
that
society
there
is
as
stagnant
as
its
waters
that
men
always
die
as
soon
as
they
reach
it
and
when
they
live
are
such
wretched
creatures
that
life
is
a
misfortune
calumny
reports
it
to
have
been
ruined
by
the
abolition
of
slavery
milk
of
human
kindness
would
forbid
the
further
exportation
of
europeans
to
this
white
man
grave
and
philanthropy
for
the
good
of
mankind
would
wish
to
have
it
drowned
beneath
its
own
rivers
there
never
was
a
land
so
ill
spoken
of
and
never
one
that
deserved
it
so
little
all
the
above
calumnies
i
contradict
and
as
i
lived
there
for
a
fortnight
would
it
could
have
been
a
month
i
expect
to
be
believed
if
there
were
but
a
snug
secretaryship
vacant
there
and
these
things
in
demerara
are
very
snug
how
i
would
invoke
the
goddess
of
patronage
how
i
would
nibble
round
the
officials
of
the
colonial
office
how
i
would
stir
up
my
friends
friends
to
write
little
notes
to
their
friends
for
demerara
is
the
elysium
of
the
tropics
the
west
indian
happy
valley
of
rasselas
the
one
true
and
actual
utopia
of
the
caribbean
seas
the
transatlantic
eden
the
men
in
demerara
are
never
angry
and
the
women
are
never
cross
life
flows
along
on
a
perpetual
stream
of
love
smiles
champagne
and
everybody
has
enough
of
everything
the
only
persons
who
do
not
thrive
are
the
doctors
and
for
them
as
the
country
affords
them
so
little
to
do
the
local
government
no
doubt
provides
liberal
pensions
the
form
of
government
is
a
mild
despotism
tempered
by
sugar
the
governor
is
the
father
of
his
people
and
the
governor
wife
the
mother
the
colony
forms
itself
into
a
large
family
which
gathers
itself
together
peaceably
under
parental
wings
they
have
no
noisy
sessions
of
parliament
as
in
jamaica
no
money
squabbles
as
in
barbados
a
clean
bill
of
health
a
surplus
in
the
colonial
treasury
a
rich
soil
a
thriving
trade
and
a
happy
people
these
are
the
blessings
which
attend
the
fortunate
man
who
has
cast
his
lot
on
this
prosperous
shore
such
is
demerara
as
it
is
made
to
appear
to
a
stranger
that
custom
which
prevails
there
of
sending
to
all
new
comers
a
deputation
with
invitations
to
dinner
for
the
period
of
his
sojourn
is
an
excellent
institution
it
saves
a
deal
of
trouble
in
letters
of
introduction
economizes
one
time
and
puts
one
at
once
on
the
footing
some
may
fancy
that
they
could
do
better
as
to
the
bestowal
of
their
evenings
by
individual
diplomacy
but
the
matter
is
so
well
arranged
in
demerara
that
such
people
would
certainly
find
themselves
in
the
wrong
if
there
be
a
deficiency
in
georgetown
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
explain
that
georgetown
is
the
capital
of
the
province
of
demerara
and
that
demerara
is
the
centre
province
in
the
colony
of
british
guiana
or
that
there
are
three
provinces
berbice
demerara
and
essequibo
so
called
from
the
names
of
the
three
great
rivers
of
the
country
but
if
there
be
a
deficiency
in
georgetown
it
is
in
respect
to
cabs
the
town
is
extensive
as
will
be
explained
and
though
i
would
not
so
far
militate
against
the
feelings
of
the
people
as
to
say
that
the
weather
is
ever
hot
i
should
be
ungrateful
as
well
as
incredulous
were
i
to
do
so
nevertheless
about
noonday
one
inclination
for
walking
becomes
subdued
cabs
would
certainly
be
an
addition
to
the
luxuries
of
the
place
but
even
these
are
not
so
essential
as
might
at
the
first
sight
appear
for
an
invitation
to
dinner
always
includes
an
offer
of
the
host
carriage
without
a
carriage
no
one
dreams
of
dragging
on
existence
in
british
guiana
in
england
one
would
as
soon
think
of
living
in
a
house
without
a
fireplace
or
sleeping
in
a
bed
without
a
blanket
for
those
who
wander
abroad
in
quest
of
mountain
scenery
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
colony
has
not
much
attraction
the
country
certainly
is
flat
by
this
i
mean
to
intimate
that
go
where
you
will
travel
thereabouts
as
far
as
you
may
the
eye
meets
no
rising
ground
everything
stands
on
the
same
level
but
then
what
is
the
use
of
mountains
you
can
grow
no
sugar
on
them
even
with
ever
so
many
coolies
they
are
big
brown
valueless
things
cumbering
the
face
of
the
creation
very
well
for
autumn
idlers
when
they
get
to
switzerland
but
utterly
useless
in
a
colony
which
has
to
count
its
prosperity
by
the
number
of
its
hogsheads
jamaica
has
mountains
and
look
at
jamaica
yes
demerara
is
flat
and
berbice
is
flat
and
so
is
essequibo
the
whole
of
this
land
is
formed
by
the
mud
which
has
been
brought
down
by
these
great
rivers
and
by
others
the
corentyne
is
the
most
easterly
separating
our
colony
from
dutch
guiana
or
surinam
then
comes
the
berbice
the
next
counting
only
the
larger
rivers
is
the
demerara
then
more
to
the
west
the
essequibo
and
running
into
that
the
mazarony
and
the
cuyuni
and
then
along
the
coast
the
pomeroon
and
lastly
of
our
own
rivers
the
guiana
though
i
doubt
whether
for
absolute
purposes
of
colonization
we
have
ever
gone
so
far
as
this
and
beyond
that
are
rolled
in
slow
but
turbid
volume
the
huge
waters
of
the
orinoco
on
its
shores
we
make
no
claim
though
the
delta
of
the
orinoco
is
still
called
guiana
it
belongs
to
the
republic
of
venezuela
these
are
our
boundaries
along
the
south
american
shore
which
hereabouts
as
all
men
know
looks
northward
with
an
easterly
slant
towards
the
atlantic
between
us
and
our
dutch
friends
on
the
right
hand
the
limits
are
clear
enough
on
the
left
hand
matters
are
not
quite
so
clear
with
the
venezuelians
but
to
the
rear
to
the
rear
there
is
an
eternity
of
sugar
capability
in
mud
running
back
to
unknown
mountains
the
wildernesses
of
brazil
the
river
negro
and
the
tributaries
of
the
amazon
an
eternity
of
sugar
capability
to
which
england
colony
can
lay
claim
if
only
she
could
manage
so
much
as
the
surveying
of
it
sugar
said
an
enterprising
demerara
planter
to
me
are
you
talking
of
sugar
give
me
my
heart
desire
in
coolies
and
i
will
make
you
a
million
of
hogsheads
of
sugar
without
stirring
from
the
colony
now
the
world
supply
some
twelve
years
ago
was
about
a
million
hogsheads
it
has
since
increased
maybe
by
a
tenth
what
a
land
then
is
this
of
british
guiana
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
with
sugar
and
rum
a
million
hogsheads
can
be
made
there
if
we
only
had
the
coolies
i
state
this
on
the
credit
of
my
excellent
enterprising
friend
but
then
the
coolies
guiana
is
an
enormous
extent
of
flat
mud
the
alluvial
deposit
of
those
mighty
rivers
which
for
so
many
years
have
been
scraping
together
earth
in
those
wild
unknown
upland
countries
and
bringing
it
down
conveniently
to
the
so
that
the
world
might
have
sugar
to
its
tea
i
really
think
my
friend
was
right
there
is
no
limit
to
the
fertility
and
extent
of
this
region
the
only
limit
is
in
labour
the
present
culture
only
skirts
the
and
the
riversides
you
will
hardly
find
an
estate
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
find
one
that
has
not
a
water
frontage
this
land
formerly
belonged
to
the
dutch
and
by
them
was
divided
out
into
portions
which
on
a
map
have
about
them
a
euclidical
appearance
let
a
b
c
d
be
a
parallelogram
of
which
the
sides
a
b
and
c
d
are
three
times
the
length
of
the
other
sides
a
c
and
b
is
thus
you
would
describe
a
demerara
property
and
the
would
have
reference
to
the
relative
quantities
of
sugar
molasses
and
rum
producible
therefrom
but
these
strips
of
land
though
they
are
thus
marked
out
on
the
maps
with
four
exact
lines
are
presumed
to
run
back
to
any
extent
that
the
owner
may
choose
to
occupy
he
starts
from
the
water
and
is
bounded
on
each
side
but
backwards
backwards
he
may
cultivate
canes
up
to
the
very
andes
if
only
he
could
get
coolies
oh
ye
philanthropic
gentry
of
the
society
only
think
of
that
a
million
hogsheads
of
sugar
and
you
like
cheap
sugar
yourselves
if
you
will
only
be
quiet
or
talk
on
subjects
that
you
understand
the
whole
of
this
extent
of
mud
beyond
the
present
very
limited
limits
is
covered
by
timber
one
is
apt
to
think
of
an
american
forest
as
being
as
magnificent
in
its
individual
trees
as
it
is
huge
in
its
extent
of
surface
but
i
doubt
much
whether
this
is
generally
the
case
there
are
forest
giants
no
doubt
but
indigenous
primeval
wood
is
i
take
it
for
the
most
part
a
disagreeable
scrubby
bushy
sloppy
unequal
inconvenient
sort
of
affair
to
walk
through
which
a
man
should
be
either
an
alligator
or
a
monkey
and
to
make
much
way
he
should
have
a
touch
of
both
there
be
no
forest
glades
there
in
which
uncivilized
indian
lovers
walk
at
ease
with
their
arms
round
each
other
naked
waists
no
soft
grass
beneath
the
trunk
on
which
to
lie
and
meditate
poetical
but
musquitoes
abound
there
and
grass
flies
which
locate
themselves
beneath
the
and
marabunters
a
villanous
species
of
wasp
and
gallinippers
the
grandfathers
of
musquitoes
and
from
thence
up
to
the
xagua
and
the
boa
constrictor
all
nature
is
against
a
cool
comfortable
ramble
in
the
woods
but
i
must
say
a
word
about
georgetown
and
a
word
also
about
new
amsterdam
before
i
describe
the
peculiarities
of
a
sugar
estate
in
guiana
a
traveller
first
thought
is
about
his
hotel
and
i
must
confess
much
as
i
love
georgetown
and
i
do
love
georgetown
that
i
ought
to
have
coupled
the
hotel
with
the
cabs
and
complained
of
a
joint
deficiency
the
clarendon
the
name
at
any
rate
is
good
is
a
poor
affair
but
poor
as
it
is
it
is
the
best
it
is
a
ricket
ruined
wooden
house
into
which
at
first
one
absolutely
dreads
to
enter
lest
the
steps
should
fail
and
let
one
through
into
unutterable
abysses
below
all
the
houses
in
georgetown
are
made
of
wood
and
therefore
require
a
good
deal
of
repair
and
paint
and
all
the
houses
seem
to
receive
this
care
except
the
hotel
ah
lenny
lenny
before
long
you
and
your
guests
will
fall
prostrate
and
be
found
buried
beneath
a
pile
of
dust
and
a
colony
of
cockroaches
and
yet
it
goes
against
my
heart
to
abuse
the
inn
for
the
people
were
so
very
civil
i
shall
never
forget
that
big
black
chambermaid
how
she
used
to
curtsy
to
me
when
she
came
into
my
room
in
the
morning
with
a
huge
tub
of
water
on
her
head
that
such
a
weight
should
be
put
on
her
poor
black
skull
a
weight
which
i
could
not
lift
used
to
rend
my
heart
with
anguish
but
that
so
weighted
she
should
think
that
manners
demanded
a
curtsy
poor
courteous
overburdened
maiden
do
sally
do
do
curtsy
i
would
cry
yes
massa
she
would
reply
and
curtsy
again
oh
so
painfully
the
tub
of
water
was
of
such
vast
proportions
it
was
big
enough
big
enough
for
me
to
wash
in
this
house
as
i
have
said
was
all
in
ruins
and
among
other
ruined
things
was
my
lock
the
door
could
not
be
closed
within
except
by
the
use
of
a
bolt
and
without
the
bolt
would
swing
wide
open
to
the
winds
exposing
my
arrangements
to
the
public
and
disturbing
the
neighbourhood
by
its
jarring
in
spite
of
the
inconvenient
difficulty
of
ingress
i
was
forced
to
bolt
it
at
six
every
morning
came
sally
with
the
tub
knocking
gently
at
the
door
knocking
gently
at
the
door
with
that
ponderous
tub
upon
her
skull
what
could
a
man
do
when
so
appealed
to
but
rush
quickly
from
beneath
his
musquito
curtains
to
her
rescue
so
it
was
always
with
me
but
having
loosed
the
bolt
time
did
not
suffice
to
enable
me
to
take
my
position
again
beneath
the
curtain
a
jump
into
bed
i
might
have
managed
but
then
the
musquito
curtain
so
under
those
circumstances
finding
myself
at
the
door
in
my
deshabille
i
could
only
open
it
and
then
stand
sheltered
behind
it
as
behind
a
bulwark
while
sally
deposited
her
burden
but
no
she
curtsied
first
at
the
bed
and
seeing
that
i
was
not
there
turned
her
head
and
tub
slowly
round
the
room
till
she
perceived
my
whereabouts
then
gently
but
firmly
drawing
away
the
door
till
i
stood
before
her
plainly
discovered
in
my
she
curtsied
again
she
knew
better
than
to
enter
a
room
without
due
salutation
to
the
guest
even
with
a
tub
of
water
on
her
head
poor
sally
was
i
not
dressed
from
my
chin
downwards
and
was
not
that
enough
for
her
honi
soit
qui
mal
y
pense
after
that
how
can
i
say
ought
against
the
hotel
and
when
i
complained
loudly
of
the
holes
in
the
curtain
the
musquitoes
having
driven
me
to
very
madness
did
not
they
set
to
work
sunday
as
it
was
and
make
me
a
new
curtain
certainly
without
avail
for
they
so
hung
it
that
the
musquitoes
entered
worse
than
ever
but
the
intention
was
no
less
good
and
that
waiter
david
was
he
not
for
the
pink
of
waiters
david
this
house
will
tumble
down
i
know
it
will
before
i
leave
it
the
stairs
shook
terribly
as
i
came
up
oh
no
massa
and
david
laughed
benignly
it
no
tumble
down
last
week
and
derefore
it
no
tumble
down
next
it
did
last
my
time
and
therefore
i
will
say
no
more
georgetown
to
my
eyes
is
a
prepossessing
city
flat
as
the
country
round
it
is
and
deficient
as
it
is
as
are
all
the
west
indies
in
anything
like
architectural
pretension
the
streets
are
wide
and
airy
the
houses
all
built
of
wood
stand
separately
each
a
little
off
the
road
and
though
much
has
not
been
done
in
the
way
of
their
gardens
for
till
the
great
coming
influx
of
coolies
all
labour
is
engaged
in
making
sugar
yet
there
is
generally
something
green
attached
to
each
of
them
down
the
centre
of
every
street
runs
a
wide
dyke
of
these
dykes
i
must
say
something
further
when
i
come
to
speak
again
of
the
sugar
doings
for
their
importance
in
these
provinces
can
not
well
be
overrated
the
houses
themselves
are
generally
without
a
hall
by
that
i
mean
that
you
walk
directly
into
some
this
indeed
is
general
through
the
west
indies
and
now
that
i
bethink
me
of
the
fact
i
may
mention
that
a
friend
of
mine
in
jamaica
has
no
door
whatsoever
to
his
house
all
ingress
and
egress
is
by
the
windows
my
bedroom
had
no
door
only
a
window
that
opened
the
in
georgetown
open
through
to
each
other
so
that
the
wind
let
it
come
which
way
it
will
may
blow
through
the
whole
house
for
though
it
is
never
absolutely
hot
in
guiana
as
i
have
before
mentioned
nevertheless
a
current
of
air
is
comfortable
one
soon
learns
to
know
the
difference
of
windward
and
leeward
when
living
in
british
guiana
the
houses
are
generally
of
three
stories
but
the
two
upper
only
are
used
by
the
family
outer
steps
lead
up
from
the
little
front
garden
generally
into
a
verandah
and
in
this
verandah
a
great
portion
of
their
life
is
led
it
is
cooler
than
the
inner
rooms
not
that
i
mean
to
say
that
any
rooms
in
demerara
are
ever
hot
we
all
know
the
fine
burst
with
which
scott
opens
a
certain
canto
in
one
of
his
poems
breathes
there
the
man
with
soul
so
dead
who
never
to
himself
hath
said
this
is
my
own
my
native
land
if
such
there
breathe
go
mark
him
well
at
any
rate
there
breathes
no
such
man
in
this
pleasant
colony
a
people
so
happily
satisfied
with
their
own
position
i
never
saw
elsewhere
except
at
barbados
and
how
could
they
fail
to
be
satisfied
looking
at
their
advantages
a
million
hogsheads
of
sugar
to
be
made
when
the
coolies
come
they
do
not
the
most
of
them
appeal
to
the
land
as
being
that
of
their
nativity
but
they
love
it
no
less
as
that
of
their
adoption
look
at
me
says
one
i
have
been
thirty
years
without
leaving
it
and
have
never
had
a
headache
i
look
and
see
a
remarkably
hale
man
of
forty
i
should
say
but
he
says
fifty
that
nothing
says
another
who
certainly
may
be
somewhat
stricken
in
years
i
have
been
here
years
and
was
never
ill
but
once
when
i
was
foolish
enough
to
go
to
england
ugh
i
shall
never
forget
it
why
sir
there
was
frost
in
october
yes
i
said
and
snow
in
may
sometimes
it
is
not
all
sunshine
with
us
whatever
it
may
be
with
you
not
that
we
have
too
much
sunshine
interposed
a
lady
you
think
we
have
do
you
not
in
the
least
who
could
ask
more
madam
than
to
bask
in
such
sunshine
as
yours
from
year
end
to
year
end
and
is
commerce
tolerably
flourishing
i
asked
of
a
gentleman
in
trade
flourishing
sir
if
you
want
to
make
money
here
your
ground
why
sir
here
in
this
wretched
little
street
there
has
been
more
money
turned
in
the
last
ten
years
than
than
than
and
he
rummaged
among
the
in
his
for
a
simile
as
though
not
a
few
of
the
profits
spoken
of
had
found
their
way
thither
do
you
ever
find
it
dull
here
i
asked
of
a
lady
perhaps
not
with
very
good
taste
for
we
englishmen
have
sometimes
an
idea
that
there
is
perhaps
a
little
sameness
about
life
in
a
small
colony
dull
no
what
should
make
us
dull
we
have
a
great
deal
more
to
amuse
us
than
most
of
you
have
at
home
this
perhaps
might
be
true
of
many
of
us
we
have
dances
and
and
private
theatricals
and
then
mrs
now
was
the
wife
and
all
eulogiums
on
society
in
georgetown
always
ended
with
a
eulogium
upon
her
i
went
over
the
hospital
with
the
doctor
there
for
even
in
demerara
they
require
a
hospital
for
the
negroes
and
what
is
the
prevailing
disease
of
the
colony
i
asked
him
dropsy
with
the
black
men
he
answered
and
brandy
with
the
white
you
do
think
much
of
yellow
fever
i
asked
him
no
very
little
it
comes
once
in
six
or
seven
years
and
like
influenza
or
cholera
at
home
it
requires
its
victims
what
is
that
to
consumption
whose
visits
with
you
are
constant
who
daily
demands
its
hecatombs
we
do
like
yellow
fever
certainly
but
yellow
fever
is
not
half
so
bad
a
fellow
as
the
brandy
bottle
should
this
meet
the
eye
of
any
reader
in
this
colony
who
needs
medical
advice
he
may
thus
get
it
of
a
very
good
quality
and
without
fee
on
the
subject
of
brandy
i
say
nothing
myself
seeing
how
wrong
it
is
to
kiss
and
tell
excepting
as
regards
yellow
fever
i
do
not
imagine
that
demerara
is
peculiarly
unhealthy
and
as
regards
yellow
fever
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
his
satanic
majesty
has
in
this
instance
been
painted
too
black
there
are
many
at
home
in
england
who
believe
that
yellow
fever
rages
every
year
in
some
of
these
colonies
and
that
half
the
white
population
of
the
towns
is
swept
off
by
it
every
august
as
far
as
i
can
learn
it
is
hardly
more
fatal
at
one
time
of
the
year
than
at
another
it
returns
at
intervals
but
by
no
means
regularly
or
annually
sometimes
it
will
hang
on
for
sixteen
or
eighteen
months
at
a
time
and
then
it
will
disappear
for
five
or
six
years
those
seem
to
be
most
subject
to
it
who
have
been
out
in
the
west
indies
for
a
year
or
so
after
that
persons
are
not
so
liable
to
it
sailors
and
men
whose
work
keeps
them
about
the
and
wharves
seem
to
be
in
the
greatest
danger
white
soldiers
also
when
quartered
in
unhealthy
places
have
suffered
greatly
they
who
are
thoroughly
acclimatized
are
seldom
attacked
and
there
seems
to
be
an
idea
that
the
white
creoles
are
nearly
safe
i
believe
that
there
are
instances
in
which
coloured
people
and
even
negroes
have
been
attacked
by
yellow
fever
but
such
cases
are
very
rare
cholera
is
the
scourge
nor
do
i
think
that
this
fever
rages
more
furiously
in
demerara
than
among
the
islands
it
has
been
very
bad
in
its
bad
times
at
kingston
jamaica
at
trinidad
at
barbados
among
the
shipping
at
thomas
and
nowhere
worse
than
at
the
havana
the
true
secret
of
its
fatality
i
take
to
be
this
that
the
medical
world
has
not
yet
settled
what
is
the
proper
mode
of
medical
treatment
there
are
i
believe
still
two
systems
each
directly
opposite
to
the
other
but
in
the
west
indies
they
call
them
the
french
system
and
the
english
in
a
few
years
no
doubt
the
matter
will
be
better
understood
from
georgetown
demerara
to
new
amsterdam
berbice
men
travel
either
by
steamer
along
the
coast
or
by
a
mail
phaeton
the
former
goes
once
a
week
to
berbice
and
back
and
the
latter
three
times
i
went
by
the
mail
phaeton
and
returned
by
the
steamer
and
here
considering
the
prosperity
of
the
colony
the
and
comfort
of
all
men
and
women
in
it
the
principles
of
the
place
and
the
coming
million
hogsheads
of
sugar
the
millennium
of
a
west
indian
colony
considering
all
these
great
existing
characteristics
of
guiana
i
must
say
that
i
think
the
governor
ought
to
look
to
the
mail
phaeton
it
was
a
woful
affair
crumbling
to
pieces
along
the
road
in
the
saddest
manner
very
to
the
poor
fellow
who
had
to
drive
it
and
to
some
of
the
five
passengers
who
were
tossed
to
and
fro
as
every
fresh
fragment
deserted
the
parent
vehicle
with
a
jerk
and
then
when
we
had
to
send
the
axle
to
be
mended
that
staying
in
the
road
for
two
hours
and
a
half
among
the
musquitoes
ohe
ohe
ugh
ugh
it
grieves
me
to
mention
this
seeing
that
rose
colour
was
so
clearly
the
prevailing
tint
in
all
matters
belonging
to
guiana
and
i
would
have
forgiven
it
had
the
phaeton
simply
broken
down
on
the
road
all
sublunar
phaetons
are
subject
to
such
accidents
why
else
should
they
have
been
named
after
him
of
the
heavens
who
first
suffered
from
such
mishaps
but
this
phaeton
had
broken
down
before
it
commenced
its
journey
it
started
on
a
system
of
ropes
bandages
and
patches
which
were
disgraceful
to
such
a
colony
and
such
a
governor
and
i
should
intromit
a
clear
duty
were
i
to
allow
it
to
escape
the
gibbet
but
we
did
reach
new
amsterdam
not
more
than
five
hours
after
time
i
have
but
very
little
to
say
of
the
road
except
this
that
there
is
ample
scope
for
sugar
and
ample
room
for
coolies
every
now
and
then
we
came
upon
negro
villages
all
villages
in
this
country
must
be
negro
villages
one
would
say
except
the
few
poor
remaining
huts
of
the
indians
which
are
not
encountered
on
the
white
man
path
true
but
by
a
negro
village
i
mean
a
site
which
is
now
the
freehold
possession
of
negroes
having
been
purchased
by
them
since
the
days
of
emancipation
with
their
own
money
and
for
their
own
purposes
so
that
they
might
be
in
all
respects
free
free
to
live
in
idleness
or
to
do
such
work
as
an
estated
man
may
choose
to
do
for
himself
his
wife
his
children
and
his
property
there
are
many
such
villages
in
guiana
and
i
was
told
that
when
the
arrangements
for
the
purchases
were
made
the
dollars
were
subscribed
by
the
negroes
so
quickly
and
in
such
quantities
that
they
were
taken
to
the
banks
in
wheelbarrows
at
any
rate
the
result
has
been
that
tracts
of
ground
have
been
bought
by
these
people
and
are
now
owned
by
them
in
fee
simple
it
is
grievous
to
me
to
find
myself
driven
to
differ
on
such
points
as
these
from
men
with
whose
views
i
have
up
to
this
period
generally
agreed
but
i
feel
myself
bound
to
say
that
the
freeholding
negroes
in
guiana
do
not
appear
to
me
to
answer
in
the
first
place
it
seems
that
they
have
found
great
difficulty
in
dividing
the
land
among
themselves
in
all
such
combined
actions
some
persons
must
be
selected
as
trustworthy
and
those
who
have
been
so
selected
have
not
been
worthy
of
the
trust
and
then
the
combined
action
has
ceased
with
the
purchase
of
the
land
whereas
to
have
produced
good
it
should
have
gone
much
further
combined
draining
would
have
been
essential
combined
working
has
been
all
but
necessary
combined
building
should
have
been
adopted
but
the
negroes
the
purchase
once
made
would
combine
no
further
they
could
not
understand
that
unless
they
worked
together
at
draining
each
man
own
spot
of
ground
would
be
a
swamp
each
would
work
a
little
for
himself
but
none
would
work
for
the
community
a
negro
village
therefore
is
not
a
picturesque
object
they
are
very
easily
known
the
cottages
or
houses
for
some
of
them
have
aspired
to
strong
stable
slated
houses
stand
in
extreme
disorder
one
here
and
another
there
just
as
individual
caprice
may
have
placed
them
there
seems
to
have
been
no
attempt
at
streets
or
lines
of
buildings
and
certainly
not
at
regularity
in
building
then
there
are
no
roads
and
hardly
a
path
to
each
habitation
as
the
ground
is
not
drained
in
wet
weather
the
whole
place
is
half
drowned
most
of
the
inhabitants
will
probably
have
made
some
sort
of
dyke
for
the
immediate
preservation
of
their
own
dwellings
but
as
those
dykes
are
not
cut
with
any
common
purpose
they
become
little
more
than
overflowing
ponds
among
which
the
negro
children
crawl
and
scrape
in
the
mud
and
are
either
drowned
or
escape
drowning
as
providence
may
direct
the
spaces
between
the
buildings
are
covered
with
no
verdure
they
are
mere
mud
patches
and
are
cracked
in
dry
weather
wet
slippery
and
filthy
in
the
rainy
seasons
the
plantation
grounds
of
these
people
are
outside
the
village
and
afford
i
am
told
cause
for
constant
quarrelling
they
do
however
also
afford
means
of
support
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
so
that
the
negroes
can
live
some
without
work
and
some
by
working
one
or
two
days
in
the
week
it
may
perhaps
be
difficult
to
explain
why
a
man
should
be
expected
to
work
if
he
can
live
on
his
own
property
without
working
and
enjoy
such
comforts
as
he
desires
and
it
may
be
equally
difficult
to
explain
why
complaint
should
be
made
as
to
the
wretchedness
of
any
men
who
do
not
themselves
feel
that
their
own
state
is
wretched
but
nevertheless
on
seeing
what
there
is
here
to
be
seen
it
is
impossible
to
withstand
the
instinctive
conviction
that
a
village
of
freeholding
negroes
is
a
failure
and
that
the
community
has
not
been
served
by
the
process
either
as
regards
themselves
or
as
regards
the
country
late
at
night
we
did
reach
new
amsterdam
and
crossed
the
broad
berbice
after
dark
in
a
little
ferryboat
which
seemed
to
be
perilously
near
the
water
at
ten
i
found
myself
at
the
hotel
and
pronounce
it
to
be
without
hesitation
the
best
inn
not
only
in
that
colony
but
in
any
of
these
western
colonies
belonging
to
great
britain
it
is
kept
by
a
negro
one
paris
brittain
of
whom
i
was
informed
that
he
was
once
a
slave
o
si
sic
omnes
but
as
regards
my
experience
he
is
merely
the
exception
which
proves
the
rule
i
am
glad
however
to
say
a
good
word
for
the
energies
and
ambition
of
one
of
the
race
and
shall
be
glad
if
i
can
obtain
for
paris
brittain
an
innkeeper
immortality
his
deserts
are
so
much
the
greater
in
that
his
scope
for
displaying
them
is
so
very
limited
no
man
can
walk
along
the
broad
strand
street
of
new
amsterdam
and
then
up
into
its
parallel
street
so
back
towards
the
and
down
again
to
the
sea
without
thinking
of
knickerbocker
and
rip
van
winkle
the
dutchman
who
built
new
amsterdam
and
made
it
once
a
thriving
town
must
be
still
sleeping
as
the
new
york
dutchman
once
slept
waiting
the
time
when
an
irruption
from
paramaribo
and
surinam
shall
again
restore
the
place
to
its
old
possessors
at
present
life
certainly
stagnates
at
new
amsterdam
three
persons
in
the
street
constitute
a
crowd
and
five
collected
for
any
purpose
would
form
a
goodly
club
but
the
place
is
clean
and
orderly
and
the
houses
are
good
and
in
good
repair
they
stand
as
do
the
houses
in
georgetown
separately
each
surrounded
by
its
own
garden
or
yard
and
are
built
with
reference
to
the
breeze
from
the
windows
the
estates
up
the
berbice
river
and
the
canje
creek
which
runs
into
it
are
i
believe
as
productive
as
those
on
the
coast
or
on
the
demerara
or
essequibo
rivers
and
are
as
well
cultivated
but
their
owners
no
longer
ship
their
sugars
from
new
amsterdam
the
bar
across
the
berbice
river
is
objectionable
and
the
trade
of
georgetown
has
absorbed
the
business
of
the
colony
in
olden
times
berbice
and
demerara
were
blessed
each
with
its
own
governor
and
the
two
towns
stood
each
on
its
own
bottom
as
two
capitals
but
those
halcyon
days
halcyon
for
berbice
are
gone
and
rip
van
winkle
with
all
his
brethren
is
asleep
i
should
have
said
in
speaking
of
my
journey
from
demerara
to
berbice
that
the
first
fifteen
miles
were
performed
by
railway
the
colony
would
have
fair
ground
of
complaint
against
me
were
i
to
omit
to
notice
that
it
has
so
far
progressed
in
civilization
as
to
own
a
railway
as
far
as
i
could
learn
the
shares
do
not
at
present
stand
at
a
high
premium
from
berbice
i
returned
in
a
coasting
steamer
it
was
a
sleepy
dull
hot
journey
without
subject
of
deep
interest
i
can
only
remember
of
it
that
they
gave
us
an
excellent
luncheon
on
board
and
luncheons
at
such
times
are
very
valuable
in
breaking
the
tedium
of
the
day
and
now
a
word
as
to
the
million
hogsheads
of
sugar
and
as
to
the
necessary
coolies
guiana
has
some
reason
to
be
proud
seeing
that
at
present
it
beats
all
the
neighbouring
british
colonies
in
the
quantity
of
sugar
produced
i
believe
that
it
also
beats
them
all
as
to
the
quantity
of
rum
though
jamaica
still
stands
first
as
to
the
quality
in
round
numbers
the
sugar
exported
from
guiana
may
be
stated
at
seventy
thousand
hogsheads
barbados
exports
about
fifty
thousand
trinidad
and
jamaica
under
forty
thousand
no
other
british
west
indian
colony
gives
fifteen
thousand
but
guadaloupe
and
martinique
two
french
islands
produce
one
over
fifty
thousand
and
the
other
nearly
seventy
thousand
hogsheads
in
order
to
make
this
measurement
intelligible
i
may
explain
that
a
hogshead
is
generally
said
to
contain
a
ton
weight
of
sugar
but
that
when
reaching
the
market
it
very
rarely
does
come
up
to
that
weight
i
do
not
give
this
information
as
statistically
correct
but
as
being
sufficiently
so
to
guide
the
ideas
of
a
man
only
ordinarily
anxious
to
be
acquainted
in
an
ordinary
manner
with
what
is
going
on
in
the
west
indies
i
would
not
therefore
recommend
any
member
of
parliament
to
quote
the
above
figures
in
the
house
some
twelve
years
ago
the
whole
produce
of
sugar
in
the
west
indies
including
guiana
and
excluding
the
spanish
islands
was
hogsheads
the
amount
which
i
have
above
recapitulated
in
which
the
smaller
islands
have
been
altogether
omitted
exceeds
it
may
therefore
be
taken
as
a
fact
that
on
the
whole
the
evil
days
have
come
to
their
worst
and
that
the
tables
are
turned
it
must
however
be
admitted
that
the
above
figures
tell
more
for
french
than
for
english
prosperity
in
these
countries
sugar
and
labour
are
almost
synonymous
at
any
rate
they
are
convertible
substances
in
none
of
the
colonies
named
except
barbados
is
the
amount
of
sugar
produced
limited
by
any
other
law
than
the
amount
of
labour
to
be
obtained
and
in
none
of
them
with
that
one
exception
can
any
prosperity
be
hoped
for
excepting
by
means
of
immigrating
labour
what
i
mean
to
state
is
this
that
the
extent
of
native
work
which
can
be
obtained
by
the
planters
and
at
terms
which
would
enable
them
to
grow
their
produce
and
bring
it
to
the
market
does
not
in
any
of
these
colonies
suffice
for
success
it
can
be
worth
no
man
while
to
lay
out
his
capital
in
jamaica
in
trinidad
or
in
guiana
unless
he
has
reasonable
hope
that
labouring
men
will
be
brought
into
those
countries
the
great
west
indian
question
is
now
this
is
there
reasonable
ground
for
such
hope
the
society
tells
us
that
we
ought
to
have
no
such
hope
that
it
is
simply
hoping
for
a
return
of
slavery
that
black
or
coloured
labourers
brought
from
other
lands
to
the
west
indies
can
not
be
regarded
as
free
men
that
labourers
so
brought
will
surely
be
and
that
the
native
negro
labourer
requires
protection
as
to
that
question
of
the
return
to
slavery
i
have
already
said
what
few
words
i
have
to
offer
in
one
sense
no
dependent
man
working
for
wages
can
be
free
he
must
abide
by
the
terms
of
his
contract
but
in
the
usually
accepted
sense
of
the
word
freedom
the
coolie
or
chinaman
immigrating
to
the
west
indies
is
free
as
to
the
charge
of
ill
usage
it
appears
to
me
that
these
men
could
not
be
treated
with
more
tenderness
unless
they
were
put
separately
each
under
his
own
glass
case
with
a
piece
of
velvet
on
which
to
lie
in
england
we
know
of
no
such
treatment
for
field
labourers
on
their
arrival
in
demerara
they
are
distributed
among
the
planters
by
the
governor
to
each
planter
according
to
his
application
his
means
of
providing
for
them
and
his
willingness
and
ability
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
immigration
by
yearly
instalments
they
are
sent
to
no
estate
till
a
government
officer
shall
have
reported
that
there
are
houses
for
them
to
occupy
there
must
be
a
hospital
for
them
on
the
estate
and
a
regular
doctor
with
a
sufficient
salary
the
rate
of
their
wages
is
stipulated
and
their
hours
of
work
though
the
contract
is
for
five
years
they
can
leave
the
estate
at
the
end
of
the
first
three
transferring
their
services
to
any
other
master
and
at
the
end
of
the
five
years
they
are
entitled
to
a
free
passage
home
if
there
be
no
hardship
in
all
this
to
the
immigrating
coolie
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
that
there
is
hardship
to
the
planter
who
receives
him
he
is
placed
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
the
governor
who
having
the
power
of
giving
or
refusing
coolies
becomes
despotic
and
then
when
this
stranger
from
hindostan
has
been
taught
something
of
his
work
he
can
himself
select
another
master
so
that
one
planter
may
bribe
away
the
labourers
of
another
this
however
is
checked
to
a
certain
degree
by
a
regulation
which
requires
the
bribing
interloper
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
expense
of
immigration
as
to
the
native
negro
requiring
protection
protection
that
is
against
competitive
labour
the
idea
is
too
absurd
to
require
any
argument
to
refute
it
as
it
at
present
is
the
competition
having
been
established
and
being
now
in
existence
to
a
certain
small
extent
these
happy
negro
gentlemen
will
not
work
on
an
average
more
than
three
days
a
week
nor
for
above
six
hours
a
day
i
saw
a
gang
of
ten
or
twelve
negro
girls
in
a
lying
idle
on
the
ground
waiting
to
commence
their
week
labour
it
was
tuesday
morning
on
the
monday
they
had
of
course
not
come
near
the
field
on
the
morning
of
my
visit
they
were
lying
with
their
hoes
beside
them
meditating
whether
or
no
they
would
measure
out
their
work
the
planter
was
with
me
and
they
instantly
attacked
him
no
massa
we
no
workey
money
no
nuff
said
one
four
bits
no
pay
no
pay
at
all
said
another
five
bits
massa
and
we
gin
morrow
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
gentleman
refused
to
bargain
with
them
they
measure
their
work
said
he
on
thursday
they
will
begin
and
on
friday
they
will
finish
for
the
week
but
will
they
not
look
elsewhere
for
other
work
i
asked
of
course
they
will
he
said
occupy
a
whole
day
in
looking
for
it
but
others
can
not
pay
better
than
i
do
and
the
end
will
be
as
i
tell
you
poor
young
ladies
it
will
certainly
be
cruel
to
subject
them
to
the
evil
of
competition
in
their
labour
in
guiana
the
bull
has
been
taken
by
the
horns
as
in
jamaica
it
unfortunately
has
not
and
the
first
main
difficulties
of
immigration
have
i
think
been
overcome
for
some
years
past
both
from
india
and
from
china
labourers
have
been
brought
in
freely
and
during
the
last
twelve
months
the
number
has
been
very
considerable
the
women
also
are
coming
now
as
well
as
the
men
and
they
have
learned
to
husband
their
means
and
put
money
together
such
an
affair
as
this
the
regular
exodus
that
is
of
a
people
to
another
land
has
always
progressed
with
great
rapidity
when
it
has
been
once
established
the
difficulty
is
to
make
a
beginning
it
is
natural
enough
that
men
should
hesitate
to
trust
themselves
to
a
future
of
which
they
know
nothing
and
as
natural
that
they
should
hasten
to
do
so
when
they
have
heard
of
the
good
things
which
providence
has
in
store
for
them
it
required
that
some
few
should
come
out
and
prosper
and
return
with
signs
of
prosperity
this
has
now
been
done
and
as
regards
guiana
it
will
not
i
imagine
be
long
before
negro
labour
is
if
not
displaced
made
at
any
rate
of
secondary
consequence
in
the
colony
as
far
as
the
workmen
are
concerned
the
million
hogsheads
will
i
think
become
a
possibility
though
not
perhaps
in
the
days
of
my
energetic
hopeful
friend
both
the
coolies
and
the
chinamen
have
aptitude
in
putting
money
together
and
when
a
man
has
this
aptitude
he
will
work
as
long
as
good
wages
are
to
be
earned
crescit

we
teach
our
children
this
lesson
intending
them
to
understand
that
it
is
pretty
nearly
the
worst
of
all
amors

we
go
on

it
is
all
however
of
no

the
result
is
still
the
same
nature
knows
what
she
is
about
the
love
of

is
a
good
and
useful
love
what
would
the
world
now
be
without
it
or
is
it
even
possible
to
conceive
of
a
world
progressing
without
such
a
love
show
me
ten
men
without
it
and
i
will
show
you
nine
who
lack

for

money
like
other
loved

women
for

should
be
sought
for
with
honour
won
with
a
clean
conscience
and
used
with
a
free
hand
provided
it
be
so
guided
the
love
of
money
is
no
ignoble
passion
the
negroes
as
a
class
have
not
this
aptitude
consequently
they
lie
in
the
sun
and
eat
yams
and
give
no
profitable

saccharine

her

so
far

as
she
said
it
how
she
would
turn
up
her
african
nose
and
what
contempt
she
would
express
with
her
broad
eyes
doubtless
she
does
so
express
herself
among
her
negro
friends
in
some
nigger
patois

forshaw
if
so
her
philosophy
does
but
little
to
assist
the
world
or
herself
there
is
another
race
of
men
and
of
women
too
who
have
been
and
now
are
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
this
colony
and
with
them
the
spernere
fortior
is
by
no
means
a
favourite
doctrine
there
are
the
portuguese
who
have
come
to
demerara
from
madeira
i
believe
that
they
are
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
islands
but
here
in
guiana
they
are
in
great
numbers
and
thrive
wonderfully
at
almost
every
corner
of
two
streets
in
georgetown
is
to
be
seen
a
small
shop
and
those
shops
are
i
think
without
exception
kept
by
portuguese
nevertheless
they
all
reached
the
demerara
river
in
absolute
poverty
intending
to
live
on
the
wages
of
field
labour
and
certainly
prepared
to
do
their
work
like
men
as
a
rule
they
are
a
steady
industrious
class
and
have
proved
themselves
to
be
good
citizens
in
the
future
amalgamation
of
races
which
will
take
place
here
as
elsewhere
in
the
tropics
the
element
will
not
be
the
least
efficient
i
saw
the
works
on
three
or
four
sugar
estates
in
demerara
and
though
i
am
neither
a
sugar
grower
nor
a
mechanic
i
am
able
to
say
that
the
machinery
and
material
of
this
colony
much
exceed
anything
i
have
seen
in
any
of
our
own
west
indian
islands
and
in
the
point
of
machinery
equals
what
i
saw
in
cuba
everything
is
done
on
a
much
larger
scale
and
in
a
more
proficient
manner
than
at
barbados
we
will
say
i
instance
barbados
because
the
planters
there
play
so
excellent
a
melody
on
their
own
trumpets
in
that
island
not
one
planter
in
five
not
one
i
believe
in
fifteen
has
any
steam
appliance
on
his
estate
they
trust
to
the
wind
for
their
motive
power
as
did
their
but
there
is
steam
on
every
estate
in
guiana
the
vacuum
pan
and
the
centrifugal
machine
for
extracting
the
molasses
are
known
only
by
name
in
barbados
whereas
they
are
common
appliances
in
demerara
there
two
hundred
hogsheads
is
a
considerable
produce
for
one
planter
here
they
make
eight
hundred
hogsheads
a
thousand
and
twelve
hundred
a
barbados
man
will
reply
to
this
that
the
thing
to
be
looked
to
is
the
profit
or
what
he
will
call
the
clearance
the
world
however
will
know
nothing
about
this
will
hear
nothing
of
individual
profits
but
it
will
recognize
the
fact
that
the
demerara
sugar
is
of
a
better
quality
than
that
which
comes
from
barbados
and
will
believe
that
the
merchant
or
planter
who
does
not
use
the
latest
appliances
of
science
whether
it
be
in
manufacture
or
agriculture
will
before
long
go
to
the
wall
looking
over
a
sugar
estate
and
sugar
works
is
an
exciting
amusement
certainly
but
nevertheless
it
palls
upon
one
at
last
i
got
quite
into
the
way
of
doing
it
and
used
to
taste
the
sugars
and
examine
the
crystals
make
comparisons
and
pronounce
i
must
confess
as
regards
barbados
a
good
deal
of
adverse
criticism
but
this
was
merely
to
elicit
the
true
tone
of
barbadian
eloquence
the
nasal
fecundity
of
speech
which
comes
forth
so
fluently
when
their
old
windmills
are
attacked
but
the
amusement
as
i
have
said
does
pall
upon
one
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
the
machinery
the
and
centrifugals
in
one
the
gadsden
pans
in
another
and
the
simple
oscillators
in
a
third
the
barbados
estate
stands
for
the
third
one
does
get
weary
of
walking
up
to
a
sugar
battery
and
looking
at
the
various
heated
caldrons
watching
till
even
the
inexperienced
eye
perceives
that
the
dirty
liquor
has
become
brown
sugar
as
it
runs
down
from
a
dipper
into
a
cooling
vat
i
wonder
whether
i
could
make
the
process
in
any
simple
way
intelligible
or
whether
in
doing
so
i
should
afford
gratification
to
a
single
individual
were
i
myself
reading
such
a
book
of
travels
i
should
certainly
skip
such
description
reader
do
thou
do
likewise
nevertheless
it
shall
not
exceed
three
or
four
pages
the
cane
must
first
be
cut
as
regards
a
planted
cane
that
is
the
first
crop
from
the
plant
for
there
are
such
things
as
ratoons
of
which
a
word
or
two
will
be
found
elsewhere
as
regards
the
planted
cane
the
cutting
i
believe
takes
place
after
about
fourteen
months
growth
the
next
process
is
that
of
the
mill
the
juice
that
is
has
to
be
squeezed
out
of
it
the
cane
should
not
lie
above
two
days
before
it
is
squeezed
it
is
better
to
send
it
to
the
mill
the
day
after
it
is
cut
or
the
hour
after
in
fact
as
soon
indeed
as
may
be
in
demerara
they
are
brought
to
the
mill
by
water
always
in
barbados
by
carts
and
mules
in
jamaica
by
waggons
and
oxen
so
also
in
cuba
the
mill
consists
of
three
rollers
which
act
upon
each
other
like
cogwheels
the
canes
are
passed
between
two
an
outside
one
say
and
a
centre
one
and
the
refuse
stalk
or
trash
so
called
in
jamaica
or
magass
so
called
in
barbados
and
demerara
comes
out
between
the
same
centre
one
and
the
other
outside
roller
the
juice
meanwhile
is
strained
down
to
a
cistern
or
receptacle
below
these
rollers
are
quite
close
so
that
it
would
seem
to
be
impossible
that
the
cane
should
go
through
but
it
does
go
through
with
great
ease
if
the
mill
be
good
and
powerful
but
frequently
with
great
difficulty
if
the
mill
be
bad
and
not
powerful
for
which
latter
alternative
vide
barbados
the
canes
give
from
sixty
to
seventy
per
cent
of
juice
sometimes
less
than
sixty
not
often
over
seventy
the
juice
which
is
then
of
a
colour
and
apparently
about
the
substance
of
milk
is
brought
from
the
mill
through
a
pipe
into
the
first
vat
in
which
it
is
tempered
this
is
done
with
lime
and
the
object
is
to
remedy
the
natural
acidity
of
the
juice
in
this
first
vat
it
is
warmed
but
not
more
than
warmed
it
then
runs
from
these
vats
into
boilers
or
at
any
rate
into
receptacles
in
which
it
is
boiled
these
in
barbados
are
called
taches
at
each
of
these
a
man
stands
with
a
long
skimmer
skimmering
the
juice
as
it
were
and
scraping
off
certain
skum
which
comes
to
the
top
there
are
from
three
to
seven
of
these
taches
and
below
them
last
of
all
is
the
boiler
the
veritable
receptacle
in
which
the
juice
becomes
sugar
in
the
taches
especially
the
first
of
them
the
liquor
becomes
dark
green
in
colour
as
it
gets
nearer
the
boiler
it
is
thicker
and
more
clouded
and
begins
to
assume
its
tawny
hue
over
the
last
boiler
stands
the
man
who
makes
the
sugar
it
is
for
him
to
know
what
heat
to
apply
and
how
long
to
apply
it
the
liquor
now
ceases
to
be
juice
and
becomes
sugar
this
is
evident
to
the
eye
and
nose
for
though
the
stuff
in
the
boiler
is
of
course
still
liquid
it
looks
like
boiled
melted
sugar
and
the
savour
is
the
savour
of
sugar
when
the
time
has
come
and
the
boiling
is
boiled
a
machine
suspended
from
on
high
and
called
a
dipper
is
let
down
into
the
caldron
it
nearly
fits
the
caldron
being
as
it
were
in
itself
a
smaller
caldron
going
into
the
other
the
sugar
naturally
runs
over
the
side
of
this
and
fills
it
some
little
ingenuity
being
exercised
in
the
arrangement
the
dipper
full
of
sugar
is
then
drawn
up
on
high
at
the
bottom
of
it
is
a
valve
so
that
on
the
pulling
of
a
rope
the
hot
liquid
runs
out
this
dipper
is
worked
like
a
crane
and
is
made
to
swing
itself
from
over
the
boiler
to
a
position
in
which
the
sugar
runs
from
it
through
a
wooden
trough
to
the
flat
open
vats
in
which
it
is
cooled
but
at
this
part
of
the
manufacture
there
are
various
different
methods
according
to
that
which
is
least
advanced
the
sugar
is
simply
cooled
in
the
vat
then
put
into
buckets
in
a
state
and
thrown
out
of
the
buckets
into
the
hogsheads
according
to
the
more
advanced
method
it
runs
from
the
dipper
down
through
filtering
bags
is
then
pumped
into
a
huge
vacuum
pan
a
utensil
like
a
turned
a
that
is
large
enough
to
hold
six
tons
of
sugar
then
it
is
reheated
and
then
put
into
open
round
boxes
called
centrifugals
the
sides
of
which
are
made
of
metal
pierced
like
gauze
these
are
whisked
round
and
round
by
at
an
enormous
rate
and
the
molasses
flies
out
through
the
gauze
leaving
the
sugar
dry
and
nearly
white
it
is
then
fit
to
go
into
the
hogshead
and
fit
also
to
be
shipped
away
but
in
the
simpler
process
the
molasses
drains
from
the
sugar
in
the
hogshead
to
facilitate
this
as
the
sugar
is
put
into
the
cask
reeds
are
stuck
through
it
which
communicate
with
holes
at
the
bottom
so
that
there
may
be
channels
through
which
the
molasses
may
run
the
hogsheads
stand
upon
beams
lying
a
foot
apart
from
each
other
and
below
is
a
dark
abyss
into
which
the
molasses
falls
i
never
could
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
the
negro
children
occasionally
fall
through
also
and
are
then
smothered
and
so
distilled
into
rum
there
are
various
other
processes
intermediate
between
the
vacuum
pan
and
the
simple
cooling
with
which
i
will
not
trouble
my
reader
nor
will
i
go
into
the
further
mystery
of
that
the
rum
is
made
from
the
molasses
every
one
knows
and
from
the
negro
children
as
i
suspect
the
process
of
is
very
rapid
if
the
appliances
be
good
a
planter
in
demerara
assured
me
that
he
had
cut
his
canes
in
the
morning
and
had
the
sugar
in
georgetown
in
the
afternoon
fudge
however
was
the
remark
made
by
another
planter
to
whom
i
repeated
this
whether
it
was
fudge
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
clearly
possible
that
such
should
be
the
case
the
manufacture
is
one
which
does
not
require
any
delay
in
demerara
an
acre
of
canes
will
on
an
average
give
over
a
ton
and
a
half
of
sugar
but
an
acre
of
cane
ground
will
not
give
a
crop
once
in
twelve
months
two
crops
in
three
years
may
perhaps
be
the
average
so
much
for
the
manufacture
of
sugar
i
hope
my
account
may
not
be
criticised
by
those
who
are
learned
in
the
art
as
it
is
only
intended
for
those
who
are
utterly
unlearned
but
if
looking
over
be
at
last
fatiguing
what
shall
i
say
to
that
labour
of
going
aback
which
guiana
planters
exact
from
their
visitors
going
aback
in
guiana
means
walking
from
the
house
and
manufactory
back
to
the
fields
where
the
canes
grow
i
have
described
the
shape
of
a
demerara
estate
the
house
generally
stands
not
far
from
the
water
frontage
so
that
the
main
growth
of
the
sugar
is
behind
this
going
aback
generally
takes
place
before
breakfast
but
the
breakfast
is
taken
at
eleven
and
a
demerara
sun
is
in
all
its
glory
for
three
hours
before
that
remember
also
that
there
are
no
trees
in
these
fields
no
grass
no
wild
flowers
no
meandering
paths
everything
is
straight
and
open
and
ugly
and
everything
has
a
tendency
to
sugar
and
no
other
tendency
whatever
unless
it
be
to
rum
is
the
only
growth
so
that
a
walk
aback
except
to
a
very
close
inquirer
is
not
delightful
it
must
however
be
confessed
that
the
subsequent
breakfast
makes
up
for
a
deal
of
misery
there
is
no
such
breakfast
going
as
that
of
a
guiana
planter
talk
of
scotland
pooh
but
one
has
to
think
of
that
dictum
the
prevalent
disease
sir
brandy
it
seems
however
to
me
to
show
itself
more
generally
in
the
shape
of
champagne
there
is
one
other
peculiar
characteristic
of
landed
property
in
this
colony
which
i
must
mention
all
the
carriage
is
by
water
not
only
from
the
works
to
the
town
but
from
the
fields
to
the
works
and
even
from
field
to
field
the
whole
country
is
intersected
by
drains
which
are
necessary
to
carry
off
the
surface
waters
there
is
no
natural
fall
of
water
or
next
to
none
and
but
for
its
drains
and
sluices
the
land
would
be
flooded
in
wet
weather
parallel
to
these
drains
are
canals
there
being
as
nearly
as
i
could
learn
one
canal
between
each
two
drains
these
different
dykes
are
to
a
stranger
similar
in
appearance
but
their
uses
are
always
kept
distinct
nor
do
these
canals
run
only
between
wide
fields
or
at
a
considerable
distance
from
each
other
they
pierce
every
portion
of
land
so
that
the
canes
when
cut
have
never
to
be
carried
above
a
few
yards
the
expense
of
keeping
them
in
order
is
very
great
but
the
labour
of
making
them
must
have
been
immense
it
was
done
by
the
dutch
one
may
almost
question
whether
any
other
race
would
have
had
the
patience
necessary
for
such
a
work
i
was
told
on
one
estate
that
there
were
no
less
than
miles
of
these
cuttings
to
be
kept
in
order
but
the
gentleman
who
told
me
was
he
to
whom
the
other
gentleman
alluded
when
he
used
our
old
friend
burchell
exclamation
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
these
guiana
planters
know
each
other
on
the
whole
i
must
express
my
conviction
that
this
is
a
fine
colony
and
will
become
of
very
great
importance
our
great
thunderer
the
other
day
spoke
of
the
governance
of
a
sugar
island
as
a
duty
below
a
man
notice
as
being
almost
worthy
of
contempt
we
can
not
all
be
gods
and
forge
thunderbolts
but
we
all
wish
to
consume
sugar
and
if
we
can
do
in
one
of
our
colonies
without
slaves
what
cuba
is
doing
with
slaves
the
work
i
think
will
not
be
contemptible
nor
the
land
contemptible
in
which
it
is
done
i
do
look
to
see
our
free
cuba
in
guiana
and
even
have
my
hopes
as
to
that
million
of
hogsheads
i
have
said
in
speaking
of
jamaica
that
i
thought
the
negro
had
hardly
yet
shown
himself
capable
of
understanding
the
teaching
of
the
christian
religion
as
regards
guiana
what
i
heard
on
this
matter
i
heard
chiefly
from
clergymen
of
the
church
of
england
and
though
they
would
of
course
not
agree
with
me
for
it
is
not
natural
that
a
man
should
doubt
the
efficacy
of
his
own
teaching
nevertheless
what
i
gathered
from
them
strengthens
my
former
opinions
i
do
think
that
the
guiana
negro
is
in
this
respect
somewhat
superior
to
his
brother
in
jamaica
he
is
more
intelligent
and
comes
nearer
to
our
idea
of
a
thoughtful
being
but
still
even
here
it
seems
to
me
that
he
never
connects
his
religion
with
his
life
never
reflects
that
his
religion
should
bear
upon
his
conduct
here
as
in
the
islands
the
negroes
much
prefer
to
belong
to
a
baptist
congregation
or
to
a
wesleyan
body
that
excitement
is
there
allowed
to
them
which
is
denied
in
our
church
they
sing
and
halloa
and
scream
and
have
revivals
they
talk
of
their
dear
brothers
and
dear
sisters
and
in
their
ecstatic
howlings
get
some
fun
for
their
money
i
doubt
also
whether
those
disagreeable
questions
as
to
conduct
are
put
by
the
baptists
which
they
usually
have
to
undergo
from
our
clergymen
wesleyans
i
say
because
the
practice
of
their
worship
here
is
widely
removed
from
the
sober
gravity
of
the
wesleyan
churches
in
england
i
have
said
that
the
form
of
government
in
guiana
was
a
mild
despotism
tempered
by
sugar
the
governor
it
must
be
understood
has
not
absolute
authority
there
is
a
combined
house
with
a
power
of
voting
by
whom
he
is
controlled
at
any
rate
in
financial
matters
but
of
those
votes
he
commands
many
as
governor
and
as
long
as
he
will
supply
coolies
quick
enough
and
coolies
mean
sugar
he
may
command
them
all
we
are
not
particular
to
a
shade
the
planters
wisely
say
to
him
in
what
way
we
are
governed
if
you
have
any
fads
of
your
own
about
this
or
about
that
by
all
means
indulge
them
even
if
you
want
a
little
more
money
in
god
name
take
it
but
the
business
of
a
life
is
sugar
there
the
land
the
capital
shall
be
forthcoming
whether
begged
borrowed
or
stolen
do
you
supply
the
labour
give
us
coolies
enough
and
we
will
stick
at
nothing
we
are
an
ambitious
colony
there
looms
before
us
a
great
future
a
million
hogsheads
of
sugar
the
form
of
government
here
is
somewhat
singular
there
are
two
houses
lords
and
commons
but
not
acting
separately
as
ours
do
the
upper
house
is
the
court
of
policy
this
consists
of
five
official
members
whose
votes
may
therefore
be
presumed
to
be
at
the
service
of
the
governor
and
of
five
elected
members
the
governor
himself
sitting
in
this
court
has
the
casting
vote
but
he
also
has
something
to
say
to
the
election
of
the
other
five
they
are
chosen
by
a
body
of
men
called
kiezers
probably
dutch
for
choosers
there
is
a
college
of
kiezers
elected
for
life
by
the
whose
main
privilege
appears
to
be
that
of
electing
these
members
of
the
court
of
policy
but
on
every
occasion
they
send
up
two
names
and
the
governor
selects
one
so
that
he
can
always
keep
out
any
one
man
who
may
be
peculiarly
disagreeable
to
him
this
court
of
policy
acts
i
think
when
acting
by
itself
more
as
a
privy
council
to
the
governor
than
as
a
legislative
body
then
there
are
six
financial
representatives
two
from
berbice
one
from
town
and
one
from
country
two
from
demerara
one
from
town
and
one
from
country
and
two
from
essequibo
both
from
the
country
there
being
no
town
these
are
elected
by
the
they
are
assembled
for
purposes
of
taxation
only
as
far
as
i
understood
and
even
as
regards
this
they
are
joined
with
the
court
of
policy
and
thus
form
what
is
called
the
combined
court
the
crown
therefore
has
very
little
to
tie
its
hands
and
i
think
that
i
am
justified
in
describing
the
government
as
a
mild
despotism
tempered
by
sugar
so
much
for
british
guiana
i
can
not
end
this
crude
epitome
of
crude
views
respecting
the
colony
without
saying
that
i
never
met
a
pleasanter
set
of
people
than
i
found
there
or
ever
passed
my
hours
much
more
joyously
chapter
xiii
barbados
barbados
is
a
very
respectable
little
island
and
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sugar
it
is
not
picturesquely
beautiful
as
are
almost
all
the
other
antilles
and
therefore
has
but
few
attractions
for
strangers
but
this
very
absence
of
scenic
beauty
has
saved
it
from
the
fate
of
its
neighbours
a
country
that
is
broken
into
landscapes
that
boasts
of
its
mountains
woods
and
waterfalls
that
is
regarded
for
its
wild
loveliness
is
seldom
propitious
to
agriculture
a
portion
of
the
surface
in
all
such
regions
defies
the
improving
farmer
but
beyond
this
such
ground
under
the
tropics
offers
every
inducement
to
the
negro
squatter
in
jamaica
dominica
lucia
and
grenada
the
negro
when
emancipated
could
squat
and
make
himself
happy
but
in
barbados
there
was
not
an
inch
for
him
when
emancipation
came
there
was
no
squatting
ground
for
the
poor
barbadian
he
had
still
to
work
and
make
sugar
work
quite
as
hard
as
he
had
done
while
yet
a
slave
he
had
to
do
that
or
to
starve
consequently
labour
has
been
abundant
in
this
island
and
in
this
island
only
and
in
all
the
west
indian
troubles
it
has
kept
its
head
above
water
and
made
sugar
respectably
not
indeed
showing
much
sugar
genius
or
going
ahead
in
the
way
of
improvements
but
paying
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
supporting
itself
and
earning
its
bread
decently
by
the
sweat
of
its
brow
the
pity
is
that
the
barbadians
themselves
should
think
so
much
of
their
own
achievements
the
story
runs
that
when
europe
was
convulsed
by
revolutions
and
wars
when
continental
sovereigns
were
flying
hither
and
thither
and
there
was
so
strong
a
rumour
that
napoleon
was
going
to
eat
us
the
great
napoleon
i
mean
that
then
i
say
the
barbadians
sent
word
over
to
poor
king
george
the
third
bidding
him
fear
nothing
if
england
could
not
protect
him
barbados
would
let
him
come
to
them
if
things
looked
really
blue
on
his
side
of
the
channel
it
was
a
fine
spirited
message
but
perhaps
a
little
self
glorious
that
i
should
say
is
the
character
of
the
island
in
general
as
to
its
appearance
it
is
as
i
have
said
totally
different
from
any
of
the
other
islands
and
to
an
english
eye
much
less
attractive
in
its
character
but
for
the
heat
its
appearance
would
not
strike
with
any
surprise
an
englishman
accustomed
to
an
ordinary
but
ugly
agricultural
country
it
has
not
the
thick
tropical
foliage
which
is
so
abundant
in
the
other
islands
nor
the
wild
grassy
dells
happily
for
the
barbadians
every
inch
of
it
will
produce
canes
and
to
the
credit
of
the
barbadians
every
inch
of
it
does
so
a
barbadian
has
a
right
to
be
proud
of
this
but
it
does
not
make
the
island
interesting
it
is
the
waste
land
of
the
world
that
makes
it
picturesque
but
there
is
not
a
rood
of
waste
land
in
barbados
it
certainly
is
not
the
country
for
a
gipsy
immigration
indeed
i
doubt
whether
there
is
even
room
for
a
picnic
the
island
is
something
over
twenty
miles
long
and
something
over
twelve
broad
the
roads
are
excellent
but
so
white
that
they
sadly
hurt
the
eye
of
a
stranger
the
authorities
have
been
very
particular
about
their
milestones
and
the
inhabitants
talk
much
about
their
journeys
i
found
myself
constantly
being
impressed
with
ideas
of
distance
till
i
was
impelled
to
suggest
a
rather
extended
system
of
railroads
a
proposition
which
was
taken
in
very
good
part
i
was
informed
that
the
population
was
larger
than
that
of
china
but
my
informant
of
course
meant
by
the
square
foot
he
could
hardly
have
counted
by
the
square
mile
in
barbados
and
thus
i
was
irresistibly
made
to
think
of
the
frog
that
would
blow
itself
out
and
look
as
large
as
an
ox
bridgetown
the
metropolis
of
the
island
is
much
like
a
second
or
third
rate
english
town
it
has
none
of
the
general
peculiarities
of
the
west
indies
except
the
heat
the
streets
are
narrow
irregular
and
crooked
so
that
at
first
a
stranger
is
apt
to
miss
his
way
they
all
however
converge
at
trafalgar
square
a
spot
which
in
barbados
is
presumed
to
compete
with
the
open
space
at
charing
cross
bearing
the
same
name
they
have
this
resemblance
that
each
contains
a
statue
of
nelson
the
barbadian
trafalgar
square
contains
also
a
tree
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
its
namesake
it
can
make
also
this
boast
that
no
attempt
has
been
made
within
it
which
has
failed
so
grievously
as
our
picture
gallery
in
saying
this
however
i
speak
of
the
building
only
by
no
means
of
the
pictures
there
are
good
shops
in
bridgetown
good
respectable
shops
that
sell
everything
from
a
candle
down
to
a
coffin
including
corals
and
widows
caps
but
they
are
hot
fusty
crowded
places
as
are
such
places
in
english
towns
but
then
the
question
of
heat
here
is
of
such
vital
moment
a
purchase
of
a
pair
of
gloves
in
barbados
drives
one
at
once
into
the
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
explain
this
very
peculiar
delightful
but
too
dangerous
west
indian
institution
i
do
not
know
that
there
was
any
in
kingston
jamaica
if
there
be
one
there
my
friends
were
peculiarly
backward
for
i
certainly
was
not
made
acquainted
with
it
but
everywhere
else
at
demerara
trinidad
barbados
and
thomas
i
was
duly
introduced
to
the
there
is
something
cool
and
mild
in
the
name
which
makes
one
fancy
that
ladies
would
delight
to
frequent
it
but
alas
a
west
indian
ice
house
is
but
a
a
place
where
one
goes
to
liquor
as
the
americans
call
it
without
the
knowledge
of
the
feminine
creation
it
is
a
at
which
the
draughts
are
all
cool
are
all
iced
but
at
which
alas
they
are
also
all
strong
the
brandy
i
fear
is
as
essential
as
the
ice
a
man
may
it
is
true
drink
iced
without
any
concomitant
or
he
may
simply
have
a
few
drops
of
raspberry
vinegar
to
flavour
it
no
doubt
many
an
wife
so
imagines
but
if
so
i
fear
that
they
are
deceived
now
the
in
bridgetown
seemed
to
me
to
be
peculiarly
well
attended
i
look
upon
this
as
the
effect
of
the
white
streets
and
the
fusty
shops
barbados
claims
i
believe
but
then
it
claims
everything
to
have
a
lower
thermometer
than
any
other
west
indian
island
to
be
in
fact
cooler
than
any
of
her
sisters
as
far
as
the
thermometer
goes
it
may
be
possible
but
as
regards
the
human
body
it
is
not
the
fact
let
any
man
walk
from
his
hotel
to
morning
church
and
back
and
then
judge
there
is
a
mystery
about
hotels
in
the
british
west
indies
they
are
always
kept
by
fat
coloured
ladies
who
have
no
husbands
i
never
found
an
exception
except
at
berbice
where
my
friend
paris
brittain
keeps
open
doors
in
the
city
of
the
sleepers
these
ladies
are
generally
called
miss
miss
jenny
this
or
miss
jessy
that
but
they
invariably
seemed
to
have
a
knowledge
of
the
world
especially
of
the
male
world
hardly
compatible
with
a
retiring
maiden
state
of
life
i
only
mention
this
i
can
not
solve
the
riddle
davus
sum
non
oedipus
but
it
did
strike
me
as
singular
that
the
profession
should
always
be
in
the
hands
of
these
ladies
and
that
they
should
never
get
husbands
as
a
rule
there
is
not
much
to
be
said
against
these
hotels
though
they
will
not
come
up
to
the
ideas
of
a
traveller
who
has
been
used
to
the
inns
of
switzerland
the
table
is
always
plentifully
supplied
and
the
viands
generally
good
of
that
at
barbados
i
can
make
no
complaint
except
this
that
the
people
over
the
way
kept
a
gray
parrot
which
never
ceased
screaming
day
or
night
i
was
deep
in
my
jamaica
theory
of
races
and
this
wretched
bird
nearly
drove
me
wild
can
anything
be
done
to
stop
it
james
no
massa
nothing
would
they
hang
a
cloth
over
it
for
a
shilling
no
massa
him
only
make
him
scream
de
more
to
speak
to
him
i
took
this
as
final
though
whether
the
him
was
the
man
or
the
parrot
i
did
not
know
but
such
a
bird
i
never
heard
before
and
the
street
was
no
more
than
twelve
feet
broad
he
was
in
fact
just
under
my
window
thrice
had
i
to
put
aside
my
theory
of
races
otherwise
than
on
this
score
miss
caroline
lee
hotel
at
barbados
is
very
fair
and
as
for
hot
pickles
she
is
the
very
queen
of
them
whether
or
no
my
informant
was
right
in
saying
that
the
population
of
barbados
is
more
dense
than
that
of
china
i
can
not
say
but
undoubtedly
it
is
very
great
and
hence
as
the
negroes
can
not
get
their
living
without
working
has
come
the
prosperity
of
the
island
the
inhabitants
are
i
believe
very
nearly
in
number
this
is
a
greater
population
than
that
of
the
whole
of
guiana
the
consequence
is
that
the
are
cultivated
very
closely
and
that
all
is
done
that
manual
labour
can
do
the
negroes
here
differ
much
i
think
from
those
in
the
other
islands
not
only
in
manner
but
even
in
form
and
physiognomy
they
are
of
heavier
build
broader
in
the
face
and
higher
in
the
forehead
they
are
also
certainly
less
and
more
inclined
to
insolence
so
that
if
anything
be
gained
in
intelligence
it
is
lost
in
conduct
on
the
whole
i
do
think
that
the
barbados
negroes
are
more
intelligent
than
others
that
i
have
met
it
is
probable
that
this
may
come
from
more
continual
occupation
but
if
the
black
people
differ
from
their
brethren
of
the
other
islands
so
certainly
do
the
white
people
one
soon
learns
to
know
a
bim
that
is
the
name
in
which
they
themselves
delight
and
therefore
though
there
is
a
sound
of
slang
about
it
i
give
it
here
one
certainly
soon
learns
to
know
a
bim
the
most
peculiar
distinction
is
in
his
voice
there
is
always
a
nasal
twang
about
it
but
quite
distinct
from
the
nasality
of
a
yankee
the
yankee
word
rings
sharp
through
his
nose
not
so
that
of
the
bim
there
is
a
soft
drawl
about
it
and
the
sound
is
seldom
completely
formed
the
effect
on
the
ear
is
the
same
as
that
on
the
hand
when
a
man
gives
you
his
to
shake
and
instead
of
shaking
yours
holds
his
own
still
when
a
man
does
so
to
me
i
always
wish
to
kick
him
i
had
never
any
wish
to
kick
the
barbadian
more
especially
as
they
are
all
stout
men
but
i
can
not
but
think
that
if
he
were
well
shaken
a
more
perfect
ring
would
come
out
of
him
the
bims
as
i
have
said
are
generally
stout
fellows
as
a
rule
they
are
larger
and
fairer
than
other
west
indian
creoles
less
delicate
in
their
limbs
and
more
clumsy
in
their
gait
the
male
graces
are
not
much
studied
in
barbados
but
it
is
not
only
by
their
form
or
voice
that
you
may
know
them
not
only
by
the
voice
but
by
the
words
no
people
ever
praised
themselves
so
constantly
no
set
of
men
were
ever
so
assured
that
they
and
their
occupations
are
the
main
pegs
on
which
the
world
hangs
their
general
law
to
men
would
be
this
thou
shalt
make
sugar
in
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
and
make
it
as
it
is
made
in
barbados
any
deviation
from
that
law
would
be
a
deviation
from
the
highest
duty
of
man
of
many
of
his
sister
colonies
a
barbadian
can
speak
with
temper
when
jamaica
is
mentioned
philanthropic
compassion
lights
up
his
face
and
he
tells
you
how
much
he
feels
for
the
poor
wretches
there
who
call
themselves
planters
lucia
also
he
pities
and
grenada
and
of
vincent
he
has
some
hope
their
little
efforts
he
says
are
praiseworthy
only
alas
they
are
so
little
he
does
not
think
much
of
antigua
and
turns
up
his
nose
at
nevis
and
kitts
which
in
a
small
way
are
doing
a
fair
stroke
of
business
the
french
islands
he
does
not
love
but
that
is
probably
patriotism
as
the
french
islands
are
successful
sugar
growers
such
patriotism
is
natural
but
do
not
speak
to
him
of
trinadad
that
subject
is
very
sore
and
as
for
guiana
one
knows
what
to
expect
if
one
holds
a
red
rag
up
to
a
bull
praise
guiana
in
bridgetown
and
you
will
be
holding
up
a
red
rag
to
a
dozen
bulls
no
one
of
which
will
refuse
the
challenge
and
thus
you
may
always
know
a
bim
when
i
have
met
four
or
five
together
i
have
not
dared
to
try
this
experiment
for
they
are
wrathy
men
and
have
rough
sides
to
their
tongues
but
i
have
so
encountered
two
at
a
time
yes
i
have
said
the
superiority
of
barbados
can
not
be
doubted
we
all
grant
that
but
which
colony
is
second
in
the
race
it
is
impossible
to
say
said
a
they
are
none
of
them
well
circumstanced
none
of
them
have
got
any
labour
said
b
they
ca
make
returns
said
a
just
look
at
their
clearances
said
b
and
then
look
at
ours
jamaica
sugar
is
paying
now
i
remarked
jamaica
sir
has
been
destroyed
root
and
branch
said
a
well
pleased
for
they
delight
to
talk
of
jamaica
and
no
one
can
lament
it
more
than
i
do
said
b
jamaica
is
a
fine
island
only
utterly
ruined
magnificent
such
scenery
i
replied
but
it
ca
make
sugar
said
b
what
of
trinidad
i
asked
trinidad
sir
is
a
fine
wild
island
and
perhaps
some
day
we
may
get
our
coal
there
but
demerara
makes
a
little
sugar
i
ventured
to
remark
it
makes
deuced
little
money
i
know
said
a
every
inch
of
it
is
mortgaged
said
b
but
their
said
i
look
at
their
clearances
said
a
they
have
none
said
b
at
any
rate
they
have
got
beyond
windmills
i
remarked
with
considerable
courage
because
they
have
got
no
wind
said
a
a
low
bank
of
mud
below
the
said
b
but
a
fine
country
for
sugar
said
i
they
do
know
what
sugar
is
said
a
look
at
their
vacuum
pans
said
i
all
my
eye
said
b
and
their
said
i
be
d
said
a
centrifugal
machines
said
i
now
nearly
exhausted
we
tried
them
and
abandoned
them
long
ago
said
b
only
now
coming
well
on
to
the
fight
their
sugar
is
nearly
white
said
i
and
yours
is
a
dirty
brown
their
sugar
do
pay
said
a
and
ours
does
look
at
the
price
of
our
land
said
b
yes
and
the
extent
of
it
said
i
our
clearances
sir
the
clearances
sir
are
the
thing
said
a
the
year
income
said
b
a
hogshead
to
the
acre
said
i
and
that
only
got
from
guano
this
was
my
last
shot
at
them
they
both
came
at
me
together
and
i
confess
that
i
retired
vanquished
from
the
field
it
is
certainly
the
fact
that
they
do
make
their
sugar
in
a
very
way
in
barbados
using
instead
of
steam
and
that
you
see
less
here
of
the
improved
machinery
for
the
manufacture
than
in
demerara
or
cuba
or
trinidad
or
even
in
jamaica
the
great
answer
given
to
objections
is
that
the
old
system
pays
best
it
may
perhaps
do
so
for
the
present
moment
though
i
should
doubt
even
that
but
i
am
certain
that
it
can
not
continue
to
do
so
no
trade
and
no
agriculture
can
afford
to
dispense
with
the
improvements
of
science
i
found
some
here
who
acknowledged
that
the
mere
produce
of
the
cane
from
the
land
had
been
pressed
too
far
by
means
of
guano
a
great
crop
is
thus
procured
but
it
appears
that
the
soil
is
injured
and
that
the
sugar
is
injured
also
the
canes
moreover
will
not
ratoon
as
they
used
to
do
and
as
they
still
do
in
other
parts
of
the
west
indies
the
cane
is
planted
and
when
ripe
is
cut
if
allowed
another
cane
will
grow
from
the
same
plant
and
that
is
a
ratoon
and
again
a
third
will
grow
giving
a
third
crop
from
the
same
plant
and
in
many
soils
a
fourth
and
in
some
few
many
more
and
one
hears
of
canes
ratooning
for
twenty
years
if
the
same
amount
and
quality
of
sugar
be
produced
of
course
the
system
of
ratooning
must
be
by
far
the
cheapest
and
most
profitable
in
i
believe
most
of
our
colonies
the
second
crop
is
as
good
as
the
first
and
i
understand
that
it
used
to
be
so
in
barbados
but
it
is
not
so
now
the
ratoon
almost
always
looks
poor
and
the
second
ratoons
appear
to
be
hardly
worth
cutting
i
believe
that
this
is
so
much
the
case
that
many
barbados
planters
now
look
to
get
but
one
crop
only
from
each
planting
this
falling
off
in
the
real
fertility
of
the
soil
is
i
think
owing
to
the
use
of
artificial
manure
such
as
guano
there
is
a
system
all
through
these
countries
of
burning
the
magass
or
trash
this
is
the
stalk
of
the
cane
or
remnant
of
the
stalk
after
it
comes
through
the
mill
what
would
be
said
of
an
english
agriculturist
who
burnt
his
straw
it
is
i
believe
one
of
the
soundest
laws
of
agriculture
that
the
refuse
of
the
crop
should
return
to
the
ground
which
gave
it
to
this
it
will
be
answered
that
the
english
agriculturist
is
not
called
on
by
the
necessity
of
his
position
to
burn
his
straw
he
has
not
to
boil
his
wheat
nor
yet
his
beef
and
mutton
whereas
the
barbados
farmer
is
obliged
to
boil
his
crop
at
the
present
moment
the
barbados
farmer
is
under
this
obligation
but
he
is
not
obliged
to
do
it
with
the
refuse
produce
of
his
fields
he
can
not
perhaps
use
coals
immediately
under
his
boilers
but
he
can
heat
them
with
steam
which
comes
pretty
much
to
the
same
thing
all
this
applies
not
to
barbados
only
but
to
guiana
jamaica
and
the
other
islands
also
at
all
of
them
the
magass
or
trash
is
burnt
but
at
none
of
them
is
manure
so
much
needed
as
at
barbados
they
can
not
there
take
into
cultivation
new
fresh
virgin
soil
when
they
wish
it
as
they
can
in
guiana
and
then
one
is
tempted
to
ask
the
question
whether
every
owner
of
land
is
obliged
to
undertake
all
the
complete
duties
which
now
are
joined
together
at
a
sugar
estate
it
certainly
is
the
case
that
no
single
individual
could
successfully
set
himself
against
the
system
but
i
do
not
see
why
a
collection
of
individuals
should
not
do
so
a
farmer
in
england
does
not
grow
the
wheat
then
grind
it
and
then
make
the
bread
the
growing
is
enough
for
him
then
comes
the
miller
and
the
baker
but
on
a
sugar
estate
one
and
the
same
man
grows
the
cane
makes
the
sugar
and
distils
the
rum
thus
altogether
opposing
the
salutary
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
i
can
not
see
why
the
grower
should
not
sell
his
canes
to
a
sugar
manufacturer
there
can
i
believe
be
no
doubt
of
this
that
sugar
can
be
made
better
and
cheaper
in
large
quantities
than
in
small
but
the
clearance
sir
that
is
the
question
how
would
this
affect
the
clearance
the
sugar
manufacturer
would
want
his
profit
of
course
he
would
as
do
the
miller
and
the
baker
they
complain
greatly
at
barbados
as
they
do
indeed
elsewhere
that
they
are
compelled
to
make
bad
sugar
by
the
differential
duty
the
duty
on
good
sugar
is
so
much
higher
than
that
on
bad
sugar
that
the
bad
or
coarse
sugar
pays
them
best
this
is
the
excuse
they
give
for
not
making
a
finer
article
and
i
believe
that
the
excuse
is
true
i
made
one
or
two
excursions
in
the
island
and
was
allowed
the
privilege
of
attending
an
agricultural
breakfast
at
which
there
were
some
twenty
or
thirty
planters
it
seems
that
a
certain
number
of
gentlemen
living
in
the
same
locality
had
formed
themselves
into
a
society
with
the
object
of
inspecting
each
other
estates
a
committee
of
three
was
named
in
each
case
by
the
president
and
this
committee
after
surveying
the
estate
in
question
and
looking
at
the
works
and
stock
drew
up
a
paper
either
laudatory
or
the
reverse
which
paper
was
afterwards
read
to
the
society
these
readings
took
place
after
the
breakfast
and
the
breakfast
was
held
monthly
to
the
planter
probably
the
reading
of
the
documents
was
the
main
object
it
may
not
be
surprising
that
i
gave
the
preference
to
the
breakfast
which
of
its
kind
was
good
but
this
was
not
the
only
breakfast
of
the
sort
at
which
i
was
allowed
to
be
a
guest
the
society
has
always
its
one
great
monthly
breakfast
but
the
absolute
inspection
gives
occasions
for
further
breakfasts
i
was
also
at
one
of
these
and
assisted
in
inspecting
the
estate
there
were
however
too
many
barbadians
present
to
permit
of
my
producing
my
individual
views
respecting
the
guiana
improvements
the
report
is
made
at
the
time
of
the
inspection
but
it
is
read
in
public
at
the
monthly
meeting
the
effect
no
doubt
is
good
and
the
publicity
of
the
approval
or
disapproval
stimulates
the
planter
but
i
was
amused
with
the
true
barbadian
firmness
with
which
the
gentlemen
criticised
declared
that
they
would
not
the
less
take
their
own
way
and
declined
to
follow
the
advice
offered
to
them
in
the
report
i
heard
two
such
reports
read
and
in
both
cases
this
occurred
all
this
took
place
at
hookleton
cliff
which
the
barbadians
regard
as
the
finest
point
for
scenery
in
the
island
the
breakfast
i
own
was
good
and
the
discourse
useful
and
argumentative
but
as
regards
the
scenery
there
is
little
to
be
said
for
it
considering
that
i
had
seen
jamaica
and
was
going
to
see
trinidad
even
in
barbados
numerous
as
are
the
negroes
they
certainly
live
an
easier
life
than
that
of
an
english
labourer
earn
their
money
with
more
facility
and
are
more
independent
of
their
masters
a
gentleman
having
one
hundred
and
fifty
families
living
on
his
property
would
not
expect
to
obtain
from
them
the
labour
of
above
ninety
men
at
the
usual
rate
of
pay
and
that
for
not
more
than
five
days
a
week
they
live
in
great
comfort
and
in
some
things
are
beyond
measure
extravagant
do
you
observe
said
a
lady
to
me
that
the
women
when
they
walk
never
hold
up
their
dresses
i
certainly
have
i
answered
probably
they
are
but
ill
shod
and
do
not
care
to
show
their
feet
not
at
all
their
feet
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
they
think
it
economical
to
hold
up
their
petticoats
it
betokens
a
stingy
saving
disposition
and
they
prefer
to
show
that
they
do
not
regard
a
few
yards
of
muslin
more
or
less
this
is
perfectly
true
of
them
as
the
shopman
in
jamaica
said
to
me
in
this
part
of
the
world
we
must
never
think
of
little
economies
the
very
negroes
are
ashamed
to
do
so
of
the
coloured
people
i
saw
nothing
except
that
the
shops
are
generally
attended
by
them
they
seemed
not
to
be
so
numerous
as
they
are
elsewhere
and
are
i
think
never
met
with
in
the
society
of
white
people
in
no
instance
did
i
meet
one
and
i
am
told
that
in
barbados
there
is
a
very
rigid
adherence
to
this
rule
indeed
one
never
seems
to
have
the
alternative
of
seeing
them
whereas
in
jamaica
one
has
not
the
alternative
of
avoiding
them
as
regards
myself
i
would
much
rather
have
been
thrown
among
them
i
think
that
in
all
probability
the
white
settlers
in
barbados
have
kept
themselves
more
distinct
from
the
negro
race
and
have
not
at
any
time
been
themselves
so
burdened
with
coloured
children
as
is
the
case
elsewhere
if
this
be
so
they
certainly
deserve
credit
for
their
prudence
here
also
there
is
a
king
lords
and
commons
or
a
governor
a
council
and
an
assembly
the
council
consists
of
twelve
and
are
either
chosen
by
the
crown
or
enjoy
their
seat
by
virtue
of
office
held
by
appointment
from
the
crown
the
governor
in
person
sits
in
the
council
the
assembly
consists
of
who
are
annually
elected
by
the
parishes
none
but
white
men
do
vote
at
these
elections
though
no
doubt
a
black
man
could
vote
if
a
black
man
were
allowed
to
obtain
a
freehold
of
course
therefore
none
but
white
men
can
be
elected
how
it
is
decided
whether
a
man
be
white
or
not
that
i
did
not
hear
the
greater
part
of
the
legislative
business
of
the
island
is
done
by
committees
who
are
chosen
from
these
bodies
here
as
elsewhere
through
the
west
indies
one
meets
with
unbounded
hospitality
a
man
who
dines
out
on
monday
will
receive
probably
three
invitations
for
tuesday
and
six
for
wednesday
and
they
entertain
very
well
that
haunch
of
mutton
and
turkey
which
are
now
the
bugbear
of
the
english
do
not
seem
to
trouble
the
minds
or
haunt
the
tables
of
west
indian
hosts
and
after
all
barbados
little
england
as
it
delights
to
call
itself
is
and
should
be
respected
among
islands
it
owes
no
man
anything
pays
its
own
way
and
never
makes
a
poor
mouth
let
us
say
what
we
will
is
a
fine
quality
and
the
barbadians
certainly
enjoy
that
it
is
a
very
fine
quality
and
generally
leads
to
respect
from
others
they
who
have
nothing
to
say
for
themselves
will
seldom
find
others
to
say
much
for
them
i
therefore
repeat
what
i
said
at
first
barbados
is
a
very
respectable
little
island
and
considering
the
limited
extent
of
its
acreage
it
does
make
a
great
deal

trinidad
no
scenery
can
be
more
picturesque
than
that
afforded
by
the
entrance
to
port
of
spain
the
chief
town
in
the
island
of
trinidad
trinidad
as
all
men
doubtless
know
is
the
southernmost
of
the
west
indian
islands
and
lies
across
the
delta
of
the
orinoco
river
the
western
portion
of
the
island
is
so
placed
that
it
nearly
reaches
with
two
horns
two
different
parts
of
the
mainland
of
venezuela
one
of
the
south
american
republics
and
thus
a
bay
is
formed
closed
in
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
somewhat
as
is
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
the
island
of
cuba
only
that
the
proportions
here
are
much
less
in
size
this
enclosed
sea
is
called
the
gulf
of
paria
the
two
chief
towns
i
believe
i
may
say
the
two
only
towns
in
trinidad
are
situated
in
this
bay
that
which
is
the
larger
and
the
seat
of
government
is
called
the
port
of
spain
and
lies
near
to
the
northern
horn
san
fernando
the
other
which
is
surrounded
by
the
finest
sugar
districts
of
the
island
and
which
therefore
devotes
its
best
energies
to
the
export
of
that
article
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
and
near
the
other
horn
the
passages
into
the
enclosed
sea
on
either
side
are
called
the
bocas
or
mouths
those
nearest
to
the
delta
of
the
orinoco
are
the
serpent
mouths
the
ordinary
approach
from
england
or
the
other
islands
is
by
the
more
northern
entrance
here
there
are
three
passages
of
which
the
middle
is
the
largest
one
the
boca
grande
that
between
the
mainland
and
a
small
island
is
used
by
the
steamers
in
fine
weather
and
is
by
far
the
prettiest
through
this
the
boca
di
mona
or
monkey
mouth
we
approached
port
of
spain
these
northern
entrances
are
called
the
dragon
mouths
what
may
be
the
nautical
difference
between
the
mouth
of
a
dragon
and
that
of
a
serpent
i
did
not
learn
on
the
mainland
that
is
the
land
of
the
main
island
the
coast
is
precipitous
but
clothed
to
the
very
top
with
the
thickest
and
most
magnificent
foliage
with
an
one
can
distinctly
see
the
trees
coming
forth
from
the
sides
of
the
rocks
as
though
no
soil
were
necessary
for
them
and
not
even
a
shelf
of
stone
needed
for
their
support
and
these
are
not
shrubs
but
forest
trees
with
grand
spreading
branches
huge
trunks
and
brilliant
coloured
foliage
the
small
island
on
the
other
side
is
almost
equally
wooded
but
is
less
precipitous
here
however
there
are
open
glades
and
grassy
enclosures
which
tempt
one
to
wish
that
it
was
one
lot
to
lie
there
in
the
green
shade
and
eat
bananas
and
mangoes
this
little
island
in
the
good
old
days
regretted
by
not
a
few
when
planters
were
planters
and
slaves
were
slaves
produced
cotton
up
to
its
very
now
i
believe
it
yields
nothing
but
the
grass
for
a
few
cattle
our
steamer
as
she
got
well
into
the
boca
drew
near
to
the
shore
of
the
large
island
and
as
we
passed
along
we
had
a
succession
of
lovely
scenes
smiling
nooks
made
themselves
visible
below
the
rocks
the
very
spots
for
picnics
one
could
not
but
long
to
be
there
with
straw
hats
and
crinoline
pigeon
pies
and
champagne
baskets
there
was
one
narrow
shady
valley
into
which
a
creek
of
the
sea
ran
up
that
must
have
been
made
for
such
purposes
either
for
that
or
for
the
less
noisy
joys
of
some
paul
of
trinidad
with
his
creole
virginia
as
we
steamed
on
a
little
further
we
came
to
a
whaling
establishment
ideas
of
whaling
establishments
naturally
connect
themselves
with
icebergs
and
the
north
pole
but
it
seems
that
there
are
races
of
whales
as
there
are
of
men
proper
to
the
tropics
as
well
as
to
the
poles
and
some
of
the
former
here
render
up
their
oily
tributes
from
the
look
of
the
place
i
should
not
say
that
the
trade
was
flourishing
the
whaling
huts
are
very
picturesque
but
do
not
say
much
for
the
commercial
enterprise
of
the
proprietors
from
them
we
went
on
through
many
smaller
islands
to
port
of
spain
this
is
a
large
town
excellently
well
laid
out
with
the
streets
running
all
at
right
angles
to
each
other
as
is
now
so
common
in
new
towns
the
spaces
have
been
prepared
for
a
much
larger
population
than
that
now
existing
so
that
it
is
at
present
straggling
unfilled
and
full
of
gaps
but
the
time
will
come
and
that
before
long
when
it
will
be
the
best
town
in
the
british
west
indies
there
is
at
present
in
port
of
spain
a
degree
of
commercial
enterprise
quite
unlike
the
sleepiness
of
jamaica
or
the
apathy
of
the
smaller
islands
i
have
now
before
me
at
the
present
moment
of
writing
a
debate
which
took
place
in
the
house
of
commons
the
other
day
it
is
only
the
other
day
as
i
now
write
on
a
motion
made
by
buxton
for
a
committee
to
inquire
into
the
british
west
indies
and
though
somewhat
afraid
of
being
tedious
on
the
subject
of
immigration
to
these
parts
i
will
say
a
few
words
as
to
this
motion
in
as
far
as
it
affects
not
only
trinidad
but
all
those
colonies
of
all
subjects
this
is
the
one
that
is
of
real
importance
to
the
west
indies
and
it
may
be
expected
that
the
sugar
colonies
will
or
will
not
prosper
as
that
subject
is
or
is
not
understood
by
its
rulers
i
think
i
may
assume
that
the
intended
purport
of
motion
was
to
throw
impediments
in
the
way
of
the
immigration
of
coolies
into
jamaica
and
that
in
making
it
he
was
acting
as
the
parliamentary
mouthpiece
of
the
society
the
legislature
of
jamaica
has
at
length
passed
a
law
with
the
object
of
promoting
this
immigration
as
it
has
been
promoted
at
the
mauritius
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
british
guiana
and
trinidad
but
the
society
have
wished
to
induce
the
crown
to
use
its
authority
and
abstain
from
sanctioning
this
law
urging
that
it
will
be
injurious
to
the
interests
of
the
negro
labourers
the
peculiar
institution
of
slavery
is
i
imagine
quite
as
little
likely
to
find
friends
in
england
now
as
it
was
when
the
question
of
its
abolition
was
so
hotly
pressed
some
thirty
years
since
and
god
forbid
that
i
should
use
either
the
strength
or
the
weakness
of
my
pen
in
saying
a
word
in
favour
of
a
system
so
abhorrent
to
the
feelings
of
a
christian
englishman
but
may
we
not
say
that
that
giant
has
been
killed
is
it
not
the
case
that
the
society
has
done
its
work
has
done
its
work
at
any
rate
as
regards
the
british
west
indies
what
should
we
have
said
of
the
league
had
it
chosen
to
sit
in
permanence
after
the
repeal
of
the
obnoxious
tax
with
the
view
of
regulating
the
fixed
price
of
bread
such
is
the
attempt
now
being
made
by
the
society
with
reference
to
the
west
indian
negroes
if
any
men
are
free
these
men
are
so
they
have
been
left
without
the
slightest
constraint
or
bond
over
them
in
the
sense
in
which
they
are
free
no
english
labourer
is
free
in
england
a
man
can
not
select
whether
he
will
work
or
whether
he
will
let
it
alone
he
the
poor
englishman
has
that
freedom
which
god
seems
to
have
intended
as
good
for
man
but
work
he
must
if
he
do
not
do
so
willingly
compulsion
is
in
some
sort
brought
to
bear
upon
him
he
is
not
free
to
be
idle
and
i
presume
that
no
english
philanthropists
will
go
so
far
as
to
wish
to
endow
him
with
that
freedom
but
that
is
the
freedom
which
the
negro
has
in
jamaica
which
he
still
has
in
many
parts
of
trinidad
and
which
the
society
is
so
anxious
to
secure
for
him
it
but
no
i
will
give
the
society
no
monopoly
of
such
honour
we
we
englishmen
have
made
our
negroes
free
if
by
further
efforts
we
can
do
anything
towards
making
other
black
men
free
if
we
can
assist
in
driving
slavery
from
the
earth
in
god
name
let
us
still
be
doing
here
may
be
scope
enough
for
an
society
but
i
maintain
that
these
men
are
going
beyond
their
mark
that
they
are
minding
other
than
their
own
business
in
attempting
to
interfere
with
the
labour
of
the
west
indian
colonies
gentlemen
in
the
west
indies
see
at
once
that
the
society
is
discussing
matters
which
it
has
not
studied
and
that
interests
of
the
utmost
importance
to
them
are
being
played
with
in
the
dark
buxton
grounded
his
motion
on
these
two
pleas
firstly
that
the
distress
of
the
west
indian
planters
had
been
brought
about
by
their
own
apathy
and
indiscretion
and
secondly
that
that
distress
was
in
course
of
relief
would
quickly
be
relieved
without
any
further
special
measures
for
its
mitigation
i
think
that
he
was
substantially
wrong
in
both
these
allegations
that
there
were
apathetic
and
indiscreet
planters
that
there
were
absentees
whose
property
was
not
sufficient
to
entitle
them
to
the
luxury
of
living
away
from
it
may
doubtless
have
been
true
but
the
tremendous
distress
which
came
upon
these
colonies
fell
on
them
in
too
sure
a
manner
with
too
sudden
a
blow
to
leave
any
doubt
as
to
its
cause
slavery
was
first
abolished
and
the
protective
duty
on
sugar
was
then
withdrawn
the
second
measure
brought
down
almost
to
nothing
the
property
of
the
most
industrious
as
well
as
that
of
the
most
idle
of
the
planters
except
in
barbados
where
the
nature
of
the
soil
made
labour
compulsory
where
the
negro
could
no
more
be
idle
and
exist
than
the
poor
man
can
do
in
england
it
became
impossible
to
produce
sugar
with
a
profit
on
which
the
grower
could
live
it
was
not
only
the
small
men
who
fell
or
they
who
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
hitherto
living
on
an
income
raised
to
an
unjustly
high
pitch
ask
the
gladstone
family
what
proceeds
have
come
from
their
jamaica
property
since
the
protective
duty
was
abolished
let
lord
howard
de
walden
say
how
he
has
fared
buxton
has
drawn
a
parallel
between
the
state
of
ireland
at
and
after
the
famine
and
that
of
the
west
indies
at
and
after
the
fall
in
the
price
of
sugar
of
which
i
can
by
no
means
admit
the
truth
in
the
one
case
that
of
ireland
the
blow
instantly
effected
the
remedy
a
tribe
of
pauper
landlords
had
grown
up
by
slow
degrees
who
by
their
poverty
their
numbers
their
rapacity
and
their
idleness
had
eaten
up
and
laid
waste
the
fairest
parts
of
the
country
then
came
the
potato
rot
bringing
after
it
pestilence
famine
and
the
encumbered
estates
court
and
lo
in
three
years
the
air
was
cleared
the
cloud
had
passed
away
and
ireland
was
again
prosperous
land
bought
at
fifteen
pounds
the
acre
was
worth
thirty
before
three
crops
had
been
taken
from
it
the
absentees
to
whom
buxton
alludes
were
comparatively
little
affected
they
were
rich
men
whose
backs
were
broad
enough
to
bear
the
burden
for
a
while
and
they
stood
their
ground
it
is
not
their
property
which
as
a
rule
has
changed
hands
but
that
of
the
small
grasping
landlords
whose
lives
had
been
passed
in
exacting
the
last
farthing
of
rent
from
the
cottiers
when
no
farthing
of
rent
could
any
longer
be
exacted
they
went
to
the
wall
at
once
there
was
nothing
like
this
in
the
case
of
the
west
indies
indiscretion
and
extravagance
there
may
have
been
these
are
vices
which
will
always
be
more
or
less
found
among
men
living
with
the
thermometer
at
eighty
in
the
shade
but
in
these
colonies
long
and
painful
efforts
were
made
year
after
year
to
bear
against
the
weight
which
had
fallen
on
them
in
the
west
indies
the
blow
came
from
man
and
it
was
withstood
on
the
whole
manfully
in
ireland
the
blow
came
from
god
and
submission
to
it
was
instantaneous
buxton
then
argues
that
everything
in
the
west
indies
is
already
righting
itself
and
that
therefore
nothing
further
need
be
done
the
facts
of
the
case
exactly
refute
this
allegation
the
four
chief
of
these
colonies
are
barbados
british
guiana
trinidad
and
jamaica
in
barbados
as
has
been
explained
there
was
no
distress
and
of
course
no
relief
has
been
necessary
in
british
guiana
and
trinidad
very
special
measures
have
been
taken
immigration
of
coolies
to
a
great
extent
has
been
brought
about
to
so
great
an
extent
that
the
tide
of
human
beings
across
the
two
oceans
will
now
run
on
in
an
increasing
current
but
in
jamaica
little
or
nothing
has
yet
been
done
and
in
jamaica
the
fairest
the
most
extensive
the
most
attractive
of
them
all
in
jamaica
of
all
the
islands
on
god
earth
the
one
most
favoured
by
beauty
fertility
and
natural
gifts
in
jamaica
the
earth
can
hardly
be
made
to
yield
its
natural
produce
all
this
was
excellently
answered
by
sir
edward
lytton
who
whatever
may
have
been
his
general
merits
as
a
secretary
of
state
seems
at
any
rate
to
have
understood
this
matter
he
disposed
altogether
of
the
absurdly
erroneous
allegations
which
had
been
made
as
to
the
mortality
of
these
immigrants
on
their
passage
as
is
too
usual
in
such
cases
arguments
had
been
drawn
from
one
or
two
specially
unhealthy
trips
ships
ride
safe
to
port
while
the
hundredth
unfortunately
comes
to
grief
but
we
can
not
on
that
account
afford
to
dispense
with
the
navigation
of
the
seas
sir
edward
showed
that
the
coolies
themselves
for
the
society
is
as
anxious
to
prevent
this
immigration
on
behalf
of
the
coolies
who
in
their
own
country
can
hardly
earn
twopence
a
day
as
it
is
on
the
part
of
the
negroes
who
could
with
ease
though
they
wo
earn
two
shillings
a
day
he
showed
that
these
coolies
after
having
lived
for
a
few
years
on
plenty
in
these
colonies
return
to
their
own
country
with
that
which
is
for
them
great
wealth
and
he
showed
also
that
the
present
system
present
as
regards
trinidad
and
proposed
as
regards
jamaica
of
indenturing
the
immigrant
on
his
first
arrival
is
the
only
one
to
which
we
can
safely
trust
for
the
good
usage
of
the
labourer
for
the
present
this
is
clearly
the
case
when
the
coolies
are
as
numerous
in
these
islands
as
the
negroes
and
that
time
will
come
such
rules
and
restrictions
will
no
doubt
be
withdrawn
and
when
these
different
people
have
learned
to
mix
their
blood
which
in
time
will
also
come
then
mankind
will
hear
no
more
of
a
lack
of
labour
and
the
fertility
of
these
islands
will
cease
to
be
their
greatest
curse
i
feel
that
i
owe
an
apology
to
my
reader
for
introducing
him
to
an
old
forgotten
and
perhaps
dull
debate
in
england
the
question
is
one
not
generally
of
great
interest
but
here
in
the
west
indies
it
is
vital
the
negro
will
never
work
unless
compelled
to
do
so
that
is
the
negro
who
can
boast
of
pure
unmixed
african
blood
he
is
as
strong
as
a
bull
hardy
as
a
mule
docile
as
a
dog
when
conscious
of
a
master
a
salamander
as
regards
heat
he
can
work
without
pain
and
without
annoyance
but
he
will
never
work
as
long
as
he
can
eat
and
sleep
without
it
place
the
coolie
or
chinaman
alongside
of
him
and
he
must
work
in
his
own
defence
if
he
do
not
he
will
gradually
cease
to
have
an
existence
we
are
now
speaking
more
especially
of
trinidad
it
is
a
large
island
great
portions
of
which
are
but
very
imperfectly
known
of
which
but
comparatively
a
very
small
part
has
been
cultivated
during
the
last
eight
or
ten
years
ten
or
twelve
thousand
immigrants
chiefly
coolies
from
madras
and
calcutta
have
been
brought
into
trinidad
forming
now
above
an
eighth
part
of
its
entire
population
and
the
consequence
has
been
that
in
two
years
from
namely
to
its
imports
were
increased
by
and
its
exports
by
in
other
words
it
produced
with
its
coolies
three
hogsheads
of
sugar
where
without
them
it
only
produced
one
the
difference
is
of
course
that
between
absolute
distress
and
absolute
prosperity
such
having
hitherto
been
the
result
of
immigration
into
trinidad
such
also
having
been
the
result
in
british
guiana
it
does
appear
singular
that
men
should
congregate
in
exeter
hall
with
the
view
of
preventing
similar
immigration
into
jamaica
this
would
be
altogether
unintelligible
were
it
not
that
similar
causes
have
produced
similar
effects
in
so
many
other
cases
men
can
not
have
enough
of
a
good
thing
exactly
the
same
process
has
taken
place
with
reference
to
criminals
in
england
some
few
years
since
we
ill
used
them
stowed
them
away
in
unwholesome
holes
gave
them
bad
food
for
their
bodies
and
none
for
their
minds
and
did
our
best
to
send
them
devilwards
rather
than
godwards
philanthropists
have
now
remedied
this
and
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
them
but
the
philanthropists
will
not
be
content
unless
they
be
allowed
to
pack
all
their
criminals
up
in
lavender
they
must
be
treated
not
only
as
men
but
much
better
than
men
of
their
own
class
who
are
not
criminal
in
this
matter
of
the
negroes
the
good
thing
is
and
our
friends
can
not
have
enough
of
that
the
negroes
in
being
slaves
were
ill
used
and
now
it
is
not
enough
that
they
should
all
be
made
free
but
each
should
be
put
upon
his
own
soft
couch
with
on
which
to
lie
now
your
sybarite
negro
when
closely
looked
at
is
not
a
pleasing
object
distance
may
doubtless
lend
enchantment
to
the
view
as
my
sojourn
in
trinidad
did
not
amount
to
two
entire
days
i
do
not
feel
myself
qualified
to
give
a
detailed
description
of
the
whole
island
very
few
i
imagine
are
so
qualified
for
much
of
it
is
unknown
there
is
a
great
want
of
roads
and
a
large
proportion
of
it
has
i
believe
never
been
properly
surveyed
immediately
round
port
of
spain
the
country
is
magnificent
and
the
views
from
the
town
itself
are
very
lovely
exactly
behind
the
town
presuming
the
sea
to
be
the
front
is
the
savanah
a
large
enclosed
piece
of
common
the
and
hyde
park
of
trinidad
i
was
told
that
the
drive
round
it
was
three
english
miles
in
length
but
if
it
be
so
much
the
little
pony
which
took
me
that
drive
in
a
hired
buggy
must
have
been
a
fast
trotter
on
the
further
side
of
this
lives
the
governor
of
the
island
immediately
under
the
hills
when
i
was
there
the
governor
real
house
was
being
repaired
and
the
great
man
was
living
in
a
cottage
hard
by
were
i
that
great
man
i
should
be
tempted
to
wish
that
my
great
house
might
always
be
under
repair
for
i
never
saw
a
more
perfect
specimen
of
a
pretty
spacious
cottage
opening
as
a
cottage
should
do
on
all
sides
and
in
every
direction
with
a
great
complexity
as
to
doors
and
windows
and
a
delicious
facility
of
losing
one
way
and
then
the
necessary
freedom
from
boredom
etiquette
and
governor
grandeur
so
hated
by
governors
themselves
which
must
necessarily
be
brought
about
by
such
a
residence
i
could
almost
wish
to
be
a
governor
myself
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
live
in
such
a
cottage
on
the
other
side
of
the
savanah
nearest
to
the
town
and
directly
opposite
to
those
lovely
hills
are
a
lot
of
villa
residences
and
it
would
be
impossible
i
imagine
to
find
a
more
lovely
site
in
which
to
fix
one
house
with
the
savanah
for
a
foreground
the
rising
gardens
behind
the
governor
house
in
the
middle
distance
and
a
panorama
of
magnificent
hills
in
the
back
of
the
picture
it
is
hardly
within
the
compass
of
a
man
eye
and
imagination
to
add
anything
to
the
scene
i
had
promised
to
call
on
major
who
was
then
and
perhaps
is
still
in
command
of
the
detachment
of
white
troops
in
trinidad
and
i
found
him
and
his
young
wife
living
in
this
spot
and
yet
you
abuse
trinidad
i
said
pointing
to
the
view
oh
people
ca
live
altogether
upon
views
she
answered
and
besides
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
barracks
the
yellow
fever
is
over
now
the
only
place
at
which
i
came
across
any
vestiges
of
the
yellow
fever
was
at
trinidad
there
it
had
been
making
dreadful
havoc
and
chiefly
among
the
white
soldiers
my
visit
was
in
march
and
the
virulence
of
the
disease
was
then
just
over
it
had
been
raging
therefore
not
in
the
summer
but
during
the
winter
months
indeed
as
far
as
i
could
learn
summer
and
winter
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
matter
the
yellow
fever
pays
its
visit
in
some
sort
periodically
though
its
periods
are
by
no
means
understood
but
it
pays
them
at
any
time
of
the
year
that
may
suit
itself
at
this
time
a
part
of
the
savanah
was
covered
with
tents
to
which
the
soldiers
had
been
moved
out
of
their
barracks
the
barracks
are
lower
down
near
the
shore
at
a
place
called
james
and
the
locality
is
said
to
be
wretchedly
unhealthy
at
any
rate
the
men
were
stricken
with
fever
there
and
the
proportion
of
them
that
died
was
very
great
i
believe
indeed
that
hardly
any
recovered
of
those
on
whom
the
fever
fell
with
any
violence
they
were
then
removed
into
these
tents
and
matters
began
to
mend
they
were
now
about
to
return
to
their
barracks
and
were
i
was
told
as
unwilling
to
do
so
as
my
fair
friend
was
to
leave
her
pretty
house
if
it
be
necessary
to
send
white
troops
to
the
west
indies
and
i
take
it
for
granted
that
it
is
necessary
care
at
any
rate
should
be
taken
to
select
for
their
barracks
sites
as
healthy
as
may
be
found
it
certainly
seems
that
this
has
not
been
done
at
trinidad
they
are
placed
very
low
and
with
hills
immediately
around
them
the
good
effect
produced
by
removing
them
to
the
savanah
a
very
inconsiderable
distance
not
as
i
think
much
exceeding
a
mile
proves
what
may
be
done
by
choosing
a
healthy
situation
but
why
should
not
the
men
be
taken
up
to
the
mountains
as
has
been
done
with
the
white
soldiers
in
jamaica
there
they
are
placed
in
barracks
some
three
or
four
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
are
perfectly
healthy
this
can
not
be
done
in
barbados
for
there
are
no
mountains
to
which
to
take
them
but
in
trinidad
it
may
be
done
quite
as
easily
and
indeed
at
a
lesser
distance
and
therefore
with
less
cost
for
conveyance
than
in
jamaica
at
the
first
glance
one
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
white
troops
would
not
be
necessary
in
the
west
indies
as
we
have
regiments
of
black
soldiers
negroes
dressed
in
zouave
costume
specially
trained
for
the
service
but
it
seems
that
there
is
great
difficulty
in
getting
these
regiments
filled
why
should
a
negro
enlist
any
more
than
work
are
there
not
white
men
enough
men
and
brothers
to
do
the
somewhat
disagreeable
work
of
soldiering
for
him
consequently
except
in
barbados
it
is
difficult
to
get
recruits
some
men
have
been
procured
from
the
coast
of
africa
but
our
philanthropy
is
interfering
even
with
this
supply
then
the
recruiting
officers
enlisted
coolies
and
these
men
made
excellent
soldiers
but
when
interfered
with
or
punished
they
had
a
nasty
habit
of
committing
suicide
a
habit
which
it
was
quite
possible
the
negro
soldier
might
himself
assume
and
therefore
no
more
coolies
are
to
be
enlisted
under
such
circumstances
white
men
must
i
presume
do
the
work
a
shilling
a
day
is
an
object
to
them
and
they
are
slow
to
blow
out
their
own
brains
but
they
should
not
be
barracked
in
swamps
or
made
to
live
in
an
air
more
pestilential
than
necessary
my
hostess
the
lady
to
whom
i
have
alluded
had
been
attacked
most
virulently
by
the
yellow
fever
and
i
had
heard
in
the
other
islands
that
she
was
dead
her
case
had
indeed
been
given
up
as
hopeless
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
i
took
a
ride
of
some
sixteen
miles
through
the
country
before
breakfast
and
the
same
lady
accompanied
me
we
must
start
very
early
she
said
so
as
to
avoid
the
heat
i
will
have
coffee
at
four
and
we
will
be
on
horseback
at
five
i
have
had
something
to
say
as
to
early
hours
in
the
west
indies
before
and
hardly
credited
this
a
morning
start
at
five
usually
means
seven
and
six
is
a
generic
term
for
moving
before
nine
so
i
meekly
asked
whether
four
meant
four
no
said
the
husband
yes
said
the
wife
so
i
went
away
declaring
that
i
would
present
myself
at
the
house
at
any
rate
not
after
five
and
so
i
did
according
to
my
own
very
excellent
watch
which
had
been
set
the
day
before
by
the
ship
chronometer
i
rode
up
to
the
door
two
minutes
before
five
perfectly
certain
that
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
sun
early
manoeuvres
for
at
least
an
hour
but
alas
my
friend
had
been
waiting
for
me
in
her
for
more
than
that
time
our
watches
were
frightfully
at
variance
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
me
that
the
trinidadians
do
not
take
the
sun
for
their
guide
as
to
time
but
in
such
a
plight
as
was
then
mine
a
man
can
not
go
into
his
evidence
and
his
justification
my
only
plea
was
for
mercy
and
i
hereby
take
it
on
myself
to
say
that
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
kept
any
lady
waiting
before
except
my
wife
at
five
to
the
moment
by
my
watch
we
started
and
i
certainly
never
rode
for
three
hours
through
more
lovely
scenery
at
first
also
it
was
deliciously
cool
and
as
our
road
lay
entirely
through
woods
it
was
in
every
way
delightful
we
went
back
into
the
hills
and
returned
again
towards
the
over
a
break
in
one
of
the
spurs
of
the
mountain
called
the
saddle
from
whence
we
had
a
distant
view
into
the
island
as
fine
as
any
view
i
ever
saw
without
the
adjunct
of
water
i
should
imagine
that
a
tour
through
the
whole
of
trinidad
would
richly
repay
the
trouble
though
indeed
it
would
be
troublesome
the
tourist
must
take
his
own
provisions
unless
indeed
he
provided
himself
by
means
of
his
gun
and
must
take
also
his
bed
the
musquitoes
too
are
very
vexatious
in
trinidad
though
i
hardly
think
that
they
come
up
in
venom
to
their
brethren
in
british
guiana
the
first
portion
of
our
ride
was
delightful
but
on
our
return
we
came
down
upon
a
hot
dusty
road
and
then
the
loss
of
that
hour
in
the
morning
was
deeply
felt
i
think
that
up
to
that
time
i
had
never
encountered
such
heat
and
certainly
had
never
met
with
a
more
disagreeable
troublesome
amount
of
dust
all
which
would
have
been
avoided
had
i
inquired
into
the
circumstances
of
the
trinidad
watches
but
the
lady
said
never
a
word
and
so
heaped
coals
of
fire
on
my
head
in
addition
to
the
consuming
flames
of
that
sun
as
trinidad
is
an
english
colony
one
first
idea
is
that
the
people
speak
english
and
one
second
idea
when
that
other
one
as
to
the
english
has
fallen
to
the
ground
is
that
they
should
speak
spanish
seeing
that
the
name
of
the
place
is
spanish
but
the
fact
is
that
they
all
speak
french
and
out
of
the
town
but
few
of
the
natives
speak
anything
else
whether
a
parisian
would
admit
this
may
be
doubted
but
he
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
a
french
patois
and
the
religion
is
roman
catholic
the
island
of
course
did
belong
to
france
and
in
manners
habits
language
and
religion
is
still
french
there
is
a
roman
catholic
archbishop
resident
in
trinidad
who
is
i
believe
at
present
an
italian
we
pay
him
i
have
been
told
some
salary
which
he
declines
to
take
for
his
own
use
but
applies
to
purposes
of
charity
there
is
a
roman
catholic
cathedral
in
port
of
spain
and
a
very
ugly
building
it
is
the
form
of
government
also
is
different
from
that
or
rather
those
which
have
been
adopted
in
the
other
west
indian
colonies
such
as
jamaica
barbados
and
british
guiana
as
this
was
a
conquered
colony
the
people
of
the
island
are
not
allowed
to
have
so
potent
a
voice
in
their
own
management
they
have
no
house
of
commons
or
legislative
assembly
but
take
such
rules
or
laws
as
may
be
necessary
for
their
guidance
direct
from
the
crown
the
governor
however
is
assisted
by
a
council
in
which
sit
the
chief
executive
officers
in
the
island
that
the
fact
of
the
colony
having
been
conquered
need
preclude
it
from
the
benefit
of
one
does
not
clearly
see
but
one
does
see
clearly
enough
that
as
they
are
french
in
language
and
habits
and
roman
catholic
in
religion
they
would
make
even
a
worse
hash
of
it
than
the
jamaicans
do
in
jamaica
and
it
is
devoutly
to
be
hoped
for
the
island
sake
that
it
may
be
long
before
it
is
endowed
with
a
constitution
it
would
be
impossible
to
commence
a
legislature
in
the
system
of
electing
which
all
but
white
men
should
be
excluded
from
voting
nor
would
there
be
white
men
enough
to
carry
on
an
election
and
may
providence
defend
my
friends
there
from
such
an
assembly
as
would
be
returned
by
french
negroes
and
hybrid
mulattoes
a
scientific
survey
has
just
been
completed
of
this
island
with
reference
to
its
mineral
productions
and
the
result
has
been
to
show
that
it
contains
a
very
large
quantity
of
coal
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
one
of
the
gentlemen
by
whom
this
was
done
and
he
was
kind
enough
to
put
into
my
hand
a
paper
showing
the
exact
result
of
their
investigation
but
unfortunately
the
paper
was
so
learned
and
i
was
so
ignorant
that
i
could
not
understand
one
word
of
it
the
whole
matter
also
was
explained
to
me
verbally
but
not
in
language
adapted
to
my
simplicity
so
i
am
not
able
to
say
whether
the
coal
be
good
or
bad
whether
it
would
make
a
nice
hot
crackling
christmas
fire
or
fly
away
in
slaty
flakes
and
dirty
dust
it
is
a
pity
that
science
can
not
be
made
to
recognize
the
depth
of
unscientific
ignorance
there
is
also
here
in
trinidad
a
great
pitch
lake
of
which
all
the
world
has
heard
and
out
of
which
that
indefatigable
old
hero
lord
dundonald
tried
hard
to
make
wax
candles
and
oil
for
burning
the
oil
and
candles
indeed
he
did
make
but
not
i
fear
the
money
which
should
have
been
consequent
upon
their
fabrication
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
in
time
we
shall
all
have
our
wax
candles
from
thence
for
lord
dundonald
is
one
of
those
men
who
are
born
to
do
great
deeds
of
which
others
shall
reap
the
advantages
one
of
these
days
his
name
will
be
duly
honoured
for
his
conquests
as
well
as
for
his
candles
and
so
i
speedily
took
my
departure
and
threaded
my
way
back
again
through
the
bocas
in
that
most
horrid
of
all
the
chapter
xv
thomas
all
persons
travelling
in
the
west
indies
have
so
much
to
do
with
the
island
of
thomas
that
i
must
devote
a
short
chapter
to
it
my
circumstances
with
reference
to
it
were
such
that
i
was
compelled
to
remain
there
a
longer
time
putting
all
my
visits
together
than
in
any
other
of
the
islands
except
jamaica
the
place
belongs
to
the
danes
who
possess
also
the
larger
and
much
more
valuable
island
of
santa
cruz
as
they
do
also
the
small
island
of
martin
these
all
lie
among
the
virgin
islands
and
are
considered
as
belonging
to
that
thick
cluster
as
thomas
at
present
exists
it
is
of
considerable
importance
it
is
an
emporium
not
only
for
many
of
the
islands
but
for
many
also
of
the
places
on
the
coast
of
south
and
central
america
guiana
venezuela
and
new
granada
deal
there
largely
it
is
a
depôt
for
cigars
light
dresses
brandy
boots
and
eau
de
cologne
many
men
therefore
of
many
nations
go
thither
to
make
money
and
they
do
make
it
these
are
men
generally
not
of
the
tenderest
class
or
who
have
probably
been
nursed
in
much
early
refinement
few
men
will
select
thomas
as
a
place
of
residence
from
mere
unbiassed
choice
and
love
of
the
locale
a
wine
merchant
in
london
doing
a
good
trade
there
would
hardly
give
up
that
business
with
the
object
of
personally
opening
an
establishment
in
this
island
nor
would
a
milliner
leave
paris
with
the
same
object
men
who
settle
at
thomas
have
most
probably
roughed
it
elsewhere
unsuccessfully
these
thomas
tradesmen
do
make
money
i
believe
and
it
is
certainly
due
to
them
that
they
should
do
so
things
ought
not
if
possible
to
be
all
bad
with
any
man
and
i
can
not
imagine
what
good
can
accrue
to
a
man
at
thomas
if
it
be
not
the
good
of
amassing
money
it
is
one
of
the
hottest
and
one
of
the
most
unhealthy
spots
among
all
these
hot
and
unhealthy
regions
i
do
not
know
whether
i
should
not
be
justified
in
saying
that
of
all
such
spots
it
is
the
most
hot
and
the
most
unhealthy
i
have
said
in
a
previous
chapter
that
the
people
one
meets
there
may
be
described
as
an
population
in
this
i
referred
not
only
to
the
settlers
but
to
those
also
who
are
constantly
passing
through
it
in
the
shops
and
stores
and
at
the
hotels
one
meets
the
same
mixture
the
spanish
element
is
of
course
strong
for
venezuela
new
granada
central
america
and
mexico
are
all
spanish
as
also
is
cuba
the
people
of
these
lands
speak
spanish
and
hereabouts
are
called
spaniards
to
the
danes
the
island
belongs
the
soldiers
officials
and
people
are
danes
they
do
not
however
mix
much
with
their
customers
they
affect
i
believe
to
say
that
the
island
is
overrun
and
destroyed
by
these
strange
comers
and
that
they
would
as
lief
be
without
such
visitors
if
they
are
altogether
indifferent
to
money
making
such
may
be
the
case
the
labouring
people
are
all
black
if
these
blacks
can
be
called
a
labouring
people
they
do
coal
the
vessels
at
about
a
dollar
a
day
each
that
is
when
they
are
so
circumstanced
as
to
require
a
dollar
as
to
the
american
element
that
is
by
no
means
the
slightest
or
most
retiring
dollars
are
going
there
and
therefore
it
is
of
course
natural
that
americans
should
be
going
also
i
saw
the
other
day
a
map
the
united
states
as
they
now
are
and
in
prospective
and
it
included
all
these
places
mexico
central
america
cuba
domingo
and
even
poor
jamaica
it
may
be
that
the
man
who
made
the
map
understood
the
destiny
of
his
country
at
any
rate
he
understood
the
tastes
of
his
countrymen
all
these
people
are
assembled
together
at
thomas
because
thomas
is
the
and
central
depôt
of
the
west
indian
that
reason
can
be
given
easily
enough
but
why
thomas
should
be
the
of
these
packets
i
do
not
know
who
can
give
me
the
reason
for
that
arrangement
tortola
and
virgin
gorda
two
of
the
virgin
islands
both
belong
to
ourselves
and
are
situated
equally
well
for
the
required
purpose
as
is
thomas
i
am
told
also
that
at
any
rate
one
probably
at
both
good
harbour
accommodation
is
to
be
found
it
is
certain
that
in
other
respects
they
are
preferable
they
are
not
unhealthy
as
is
thomas
and
as
i
have
said
above
they
belong
to
ourselves
my
own
opinion
is
that
jamaica
should
be
the
of
these
packets
but
the
question
is
one
which
will
not
probably
be
interesting
to
the
reader
of
these
pages
they
can
not
understand
at
home
why
we
dislike
the
work
so
much
said
the
captain
of
one
of
the
to
me
by
work
he
meant
the
different
branch
services
from
thomas
they
do
not
comprehend
at
home
what
it
is
for
a
man
to
be
burying
one
young
officer
after
another
to
have
them
sent
out
and
then
to
see
them
mown
down
in
that
accursed
hole
of
a
harbour
by
yellow
fever
such
a
work
is
not
a
very
pleasant
one
indeed
this
was
true
the
life
can
not
be
a
very
pleasant
one
these
captains
themselves
and
their
senior
officers
are
doubtless
acclimated
the
yellow
fever
may
reach
them
but
their
chance
of
escape
is
tolerably
good
but
the
young
lads
who
join
the
service
and
who
do
so
at
an
early
age
have
at
the
first
commencement
of
their
career
to
make
thomas
their
residence
as
far
as
they
have
any
residence
they
live
of
course
on
board
their
ships
but
the
peculiarity
of
thomas
is
this
that
the
harbour
is
ten
times
more
fatal
than
the
town
it
is
that
hole
up
by
the
coaling
wharves
which
sends
so
many
english
lads
to
the
grave
if
this
be
so
this
alone
i
think
constitutes
a
strong
reason
why
thomas
should
not
be
so
favoured
these
vessels
now
form
a
considerable
fleet
and
some
of
them
spend
nearly
a
third
of
their
time
at
this
place
the
number
of
englishmen
so
collected
and
endangered
is
sufficient
to
warrant
us
in
regarding
this
as
a
great
drawback
on
any
utility
which
the
island
may
have
if
such
utility
there
be
but
we
must
give
even
the
devil
his
due
seen
from
the
water
thomas
is
very
pretty
it
is
not
so
much
the
scenery
of
the
island
that
pleases
as
the
aspect
of
the
town
itself
it
stands
on
three
hills
or
mounts
with
higher
hills
green
to
their
summit
rising
behind
them
each
mount
is
topped
by
a
pleasant
cleanly
edifice
and
houses
stretch
down
the
sides
to
the
water
edge
the
buildings
do
look
pretty
and
nice
and
as
though
chance
had
arranged
them
for
a
picture
indeed
as
seen
from
the
harbour
the
town
looks
like
a
panorama
exquisitely
painted
the
air
is
thin
and
transparent
and
every
line
shows
itself
clearly
as
so
seen
the
town
of
thomas
is
certainly
attractive
but
it
is
like
the
dead
sea
fruit
all
the
charm
is
gone
when
it
is
tasted
land
there
and
the
beauty
vanishes
the
hotel
at
thomas
is
quite
a
thing
of
itself
there
is
no
fair
ground
for
complaint
as
regards
the
accommodation
considering
where
one
is
and
that
people
do
not
visit
thomas
for
pleasure
but
the
people
that
one
meets
there
form
as
strange
a
collection
as
may
perhaps
be
found
anywhere
in
the
first
place
all
languages
seem
alike
to
them
one
hears
english
french
german
and
spanish
spoken
all
around
one
and
apparently
it
is
indifferent
which
the
waiters
seem
to
speak
them
all
the
most
of
these
guests
i
take
it
certainly
a
large
proportion
of
them
are
residents
of
the
place
who
board
at
the
inn
i
have
been
there
for
a
week
at
a
time
and
it
seemed
that
all
then
around
me
were
so
there
were
ladies
among
them
who
always
came
punctually
to
their
meals
and
went
through
the
long
course
of
breakfast
and
long
course
of
dinner
with
admirable
perseverance
i
never
saw
eating
to
equal
that
eating
when
i
was
there
the
house
was
always
full
but
the
landlord
told
me
that
he
found
it
very
hard
to
make
money
and
i
can
believe
it
a
hot
climate
it
is
generally
thought
interferes
with
the
appetite
affects
the
gastric
juices
with
lassitude
gives
to
the
stomach
some
of
the
apathy
of
the
body
and
lessens
at
any
rate
the
consumption
of
animal
food
that
charge
can
not
be
made
against
the
air
of
thomas
to
whatever
sudden
changes
the
health
may
be
subject
no
lingering
disinclination
for
food
affects
it
men
eat
there
as
though
it
were
the
only
solace
of
their
life
and
women
also
probably
it
is
so
they
never
talk
at
meals
a
man
and
his
wife
may
interchange
a
word
or
two
as
to
the
dishes
or
men
coming
from
the
same
store
may
whisper
a
syllable
as
to
their
culinary
desires
but
in
an
ordinary
way
there
is
no
talking
i
myself
generally
am
not
a
mute
person
at
my
meals
and
having
dined
at
sundry
tables
have
got
over
in
a
great
degree
that
disinclination
to
speak
to
my
neighbour
which
is
attributed
i
believe
wrongly
to
englishmen
but
at
thomas
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
wait
till
i
was
spoken
to
and
for
a
week
i
sat
twice
daily
between
the
same
persons
without
receiving
or
speaking
a
single
word
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
stout
lady
who
sat
opposite
to
me
and
who
was
married
to
a
little
jew
who
always
accompanied
her
soup
fish
and
then
meat
is
the
ordinary
rule
at
such
banquets
but
here
the
fashion
is
for
the
guests
having
curried
favour
with
the
waiters
to
get
their
plates
of
food
brought
in
and
put
round
before
them
in
little
circles
so
that
a
man
while
taking
his
soup
may
contemplate
his
fish
and
his
roast
beef
his
wing
of
fowl
his
allotment
of
salad
his
peas
and
potatoes
his
pudding
pie
and
custard
and
whatever
other
good
things
a
benevolent
and
waiter
may
be
able
to
collect
for
him
this
somewhat
crowds
the
table
and
occasionally
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
guest
to
guard
his
treasures
with
an
eagle
eye
hers
also
with
an
eagle
eye
and
sometimes
with
an
eagle
talon
this
stout
lady
was
great
on
such
occasions
a
bit
of
that
she
would
exclaim
with
head
half
turned
round
as
a
man
would
pass
behind
her
with
a
dish
while
she
was
in
the
very
act
of
unloading
within
her
throat
a
whole
knifeful
charged
to
the
hilt
the
efforts
which
at
first
affected
me
as
almost
ridiculous
advanced
to
the
sublime
as
dinner
went
on
there
was
no
shirking
no
half
measures
no
slackened
pace
as
the
breath
became
short
the
work
was
daily
done
to
the
final
of
cheese
cheese
and
jelly
guava
jelly
were
always
eaten
together
this
i
found
to
be
the
general
fashion
of
thomas
some
men
dipped
their
cheese
in
jelly
some
ate
a
bit
of
jelly
and
then
a
bit
of
cheese
some
topped
up
with
jelly
and
some
topped
up
with
cheese
all
having
it
on
their
plates
together
but
this
lady
she
must
have
spent
years
in
acquiring
the
exercise
had
a
knack
of
involving
her
cheese
in
jelly
covering
up
by
a
rapid
twirl
of
her
knife
a
bit
about
an
inch
thick
so
that
no
cheesy
surface
should
touch
her
palate
and
then
depositing
the
parcel
oh
ever
so
far
down
without
dropping
above
a
globule
or
two
of
the
covering
on
her
bosom
her
lord
the
israelite
used
to
fight
hard
too
but
the
battle
was
always
over
with
him
long
before
the
lady
showed
even
a
sign
of
distress
he
was
one
of
those
flashy
weedy
animals
that
make
good
running
for
a
few
yards
and
are
then
choked
off
she
was
game
up
to
the
there
were
many
animals
running
at
those
races
but
she
might
have
given
all
the
others
the
odds
of
a
pound
of
solid
food
and
yet
have
beaten
them
but
then
to
see
her
rise
from
the
table
well
pace
and
extra
weight
together
will
distress
the
best
horse
that
ever
was
shod
over
and
above
this
i
found
nothing
of
any
general
interest
at
thomas
chapter
xvi
new
granada
and
the
isthmus
of
panamá
it
is
probably
known
to
all
that
new
granada
is
the
most
northern
of
the
republics
of
south
america
or
it
should
rather
be
said
that
it
is
the
state
nearest
to
the
isthmus
of
which
indeed
it
comprehends
a
considerable
portion
the
territory
of
the
gulf
of
darien
and
the
district
of
panamá
all
being
within
the
limits
of
new
granada
it
was
however
but
the
other
day
that
new
granada
formed
only
a
part
of
the
republic
of
columbia
the
republic
of
which
bolivar
was
the
hero
as
the
inhabitants
of
central
america
found
it
necessary
to
break
up
their
state
into
different
republics
so
also
did
the
people
of
columbia
the
heroes
and
patriots
of
caracas
and
quito
could
not
consent
to
be
governed
from
bogotá
and
therefore
three
states
were
formed
out
of
one
they
are
new
granada
with
its
capital
of
bogotá
venezuela
with
its
capital
of
caracas
lying
exactly
to
the
east
of
new
granada
and
ecuador
the
state
that
is
of
equator
lying
to
the
south
of
new
granada
having
its
seaport
at
guayaquil
on
the
pacific
with
quito
its
chief
city
exactly
on
the
line
the
district
of
columbia
was
one
of
the
grandest
appanages
of
the
spanish
throne
when
the
appanages
of
the
spanish
throne
were
grand
indeed
the
town
and
port
of
cartagena
on
the
atlantic
were
admirably
fortified
as
was
also
panamá
on
the
pacific
its
interior
cities
were
populous
flourishing
and
for
that
age
fairly
civilized
now
the
whole
country
has
received
the
boon
of
utopian
freedom
and
the
mind
loses
itself
in
contemplating
to
what
lowest
pitch
of
human
degradation
the
people
will
gradually
fall
civilization
here
is
retrograding
men
are
becoming
more
ignorant
than
their
fathers
are
learning
to
read
less
to
know
less
to
have
fewer
aspirations
of
a
high
order
to
care
less
for
truth
and
justice
to
have
more
and
more
of
the
contentment
of
a
brute
that
contentment
which
comes
from
a
full
belly
and
untaxed
sinews
or
even
from
an
empty
belly
so
long
as
the
sinews
be
left
idle
to
what
this
will
tend
a
prophet
in
these
days
can
hardly
see
or
rather
none
less
than
a
prophet
can
pretend
to
see
that
those
lands
which
the
spaniards
have
occupied
and
to
a
great
extent
made
spanish
should
have
no
higher
destiny
than
that
which
they
have
already
accomplished
i
can
hardly
bring
myself
to
think
that
their
unlimited
fertility
and
magnificent
rivers
should
be
given
for
nothing
that
their
power
of
producing
all
that
man
wants
should
be
intended
for
no
use
i
can
not
believe
at
present
however
it
would
seem
that
providence
has
abandoned
it
it
is
making
no
progress
land
that
was
cultivated
is
receding
from
cultivation
cities
that
were
populous
are
falling
into
ruins
and
men
are
going
back
into
animals
under
the
influence
of
unlimited
liberty
and
universal
suffrage
in
emancipation
from
slavery
was
finally
established
in
new
granada
and
so
far
doubtless
a
good
deed
was
done
but
it
was
established
at
the
same
time
that
every
man
emancipated
slave
or
other
let
him
be
an
industrial
occupier
of
land
or
idle
occupier
of
nothing
should
have
an
equal
vote
in
electing
presidents
and
members

and
members
of
the
congress
of
the
different
states
that
in
short
all
men
should
be
equal
for
all
state
purposes
and
the
result
as
may
be
supposed
is
not
gratifying
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
a
negro
has
not
generally
those
gifts
of
god
which
enable
one
man
to
exercise
rule
and
masterdom
over
his
i
myself
should
object
strongly
to
be
represented
say
in
the
city
of
london
by
any
black
man
that
i
ever
saw
the
unfortunate
nigger
gone
masterless
whom
carlyle
so
tenderly
commiserates
has
not
strong
ideas
of
the
duties
even
of
much
less
of
the
government
of
others
universal
suffrage
in
such
hands
can
hardly
lead
to
good
results
let
him
at
any
rate
have
first
saved
some
sixty
pounds
in
a
or
made
himself
undoubted
owner
an
easy
thing
in
new
granada
of
a
freehold
not
that
negroes
are
common
through
the
whole
of
new
granada
at
panamá
and
the
adjacent
districts
they
are
so
but
in
the
other
parts
of
the
republic
they
are
i
believe
few
in
number
at
santa
martha
where
i
first
landed
i
saw
few
if
any
and
yet
the
trace
of
the
negroes
the
woolly
hair
and
flat
nose
were
common
enough
mixed
always
with
indian
blood
and
of
course
to
a
great
extent
with
spanish
blood
also
this
santa
martha
is
a
wretched
village
a
city
it
is
there
called
at
which
we
with
intense
cruelty
maintain
a
british
consul
and
a
british
there
is
a
cathedral
there
of
the
old
spanish
order
with
the
choir
removed
from
the
altar
down
towards
the
western
door
and
there
is
i
was
informed
a
bishop
but
neither
bishop
nor
cathedral
were
in
any
way
remarkable
there
is
there
a
governor
of
the
province
some
small
tradesman
who
seemed
to
exercise
very
few
governing
functions
it
may
almost
be
said
that
no
trade
exists
in
the
place
which
seemed
indeed
to
be
nearly
dead
a
few
black
or
nearly
black
children
run
about
the
streets
in
a
state
almost
of
nudity
and
there
are
shops
from
the
extremities
of
which
as
i
was
told
crinoline
and
hats
laden
with
bugles
may
be
extracted
every
one
of
my
predecessors
here
died
of
fever
said
the
consul
to
me
in
a
tone
of
triumph
what
could
a
man
say
to
him
on
so
terribly
mortal
a
subject
and
my
wife
has
been
down
in
fever
thirteen
times
heavens
what
a
life
that
is
as
long
as
it
is
life
i
rode
some
four
or
five
miles
into
the
country
to
visit
the
house
in
which
bolivar
died
it
is
a
deserted
little
country
villa
or
chateau
called
san
pedro
standing
in
a
and
now
containing
no
other
furniture
than
a
marble
bust
of
the
dictator
with
a
few
wretchedly
coloured
french
prints
with
cracked
glass
plates
the
bust
is
not
a
bad
one
and
seems
to
have
a
solemn
and
sad
meaning
in
its
melancholy
face
standing
there
in
its
solitary
niche
in
the
very
room
in
which
the
liberator
died
for
bolivar
had
grand
ideas
of
freedom
though
doubtless
he
had
grand
ideas
also
of
personal
power
and
as
has
been
the
case
with
most
of
those
who
have
moved
or
professed
to
move
in
the
vanguard
of
liberty
to
free
mankind
from
all
injurious
thraldom
is
the
aspiration
of
such
men
but
who
ever
thought
that
obedience
to
himself
was
a
thraldom
that
could
be
injurious
and
here
in
this
house
on
the
december
bolivar
died
owing
his
shelter
to
charity
and
relieved
in
his
last
wants
by
the
hands
of
strangers
to
his
country
when
the
breath
was
out
of
him
and
he
was
well
dead
so
that
on
such
a
matter
he
himself
could
probably
have
no
strong
wish
in
any
direction
they
took
away
his
body
of
course
with
all
honour
to
the
district
that
gave
him
birth
and
that
could
afford
to
be
proud
of
him
now
that
he
was
dead
into
venezuela
and
reburied
him
at
caracas
but
dying
poverty
and
funeral
honours
have
been
the
fate
of
great
men
in
other
countries
besides
columbia
and
why
did
you
come
to
visit
such
a
region
as
this
asked
bolivar
when
dying
of
a
frenchman
to
whom
in
his
last
days
he
was
indebted
for
much
for
freedom
said
the
frenchman
for
freedom
said
bolivar
then
let
me
tell
you
that
you
have
missed
your
mark
altogether
you
could
hardly
have
turned
in
a
worse
direction
our
ride
from
santa
martha
to
the
house
had
been
altogether
between
bushes
among
which
we
saw
but
small
signs
of
cultivation
round
the
house
i
saw
none
on
my
return
i
learnt
that
the
place
was
the
property
of
a
rich
man
who
possessed
a
large
estate
in
its
vicinity
but
will
nothing
grow
there
i
asked
grow
there
yes
anything
would
grow
there
some
years
since
the
whole
district
was
covered
with
but
since
the
emancipation
in
it
had
become
impossible
to
procure
labour
men
could
not
be
got
to
work
and
so
bush
had
grown
up
and
the
earth
gave
none
of
her
increase
except
indeed
where
indians
squatted
here
and
there
and
made
provision
grounds
i
then
went
on
to
cartagena
this
is
a
much
better
town
than
santa
martha
though
even
this
is
in
its
decadence
it
was
once
a
flourishing
city
great
in
commerce
and
strong
in
war
it
was
taken
by
the
english
not
however
without
signal
reverses
on
our
part
and
by
the
special
valour
so
the
story
goes
of
certain
sailors
who
dragged
a
single
gun
to
the
summit
of
a
high
abrupt
hill
called
the
papa
which
commands
the
town
if
the
thermometer
stood
in
those
days
as
high
at
cartagena
as
it
does
now
pretty
nearly
through
the
whole
of
the
year
those
sailors
ought
to
have
had
the
victoria
cross
but
these
deeds
were
done
long
years
ago
in
the
time
of
drake
and
his
followers
and
victoria
crosses
were
then
chiefly
kept
for
the
officers
the
harbour
at
cartagena
is
singularly
circumstanced
there
are
two
entrances
to
it
one
some
ten
miles
from
the
city
and
the
other
close
to
it
this
nearer
aperture
was
blocked
up
by
the
spaniards
who
sank
ships
across
the
mouth
and
it
has
never
been
used
or
usable
since
the
present
entrance
is
very
strongly
fortified
the
fortifications
are
still
there
bristling
down
to
the
water
edge
or
they
would
bristle
were
it
not
that
all
the
guns
have
been
sold
for
the
value
of
the
brass
metal
cartagena
was
hotter
even
than
santa
martha
but
the
place
is
by
no
means
so
desolate
and
the
shops
there
are
open
to
the
streets
as
shops
are
in
other
towns
men
and
women
may
occasionally
be
seen
about
the
square
and
there
is
a
trade
in
poultry
if
in
nothing
else
there
is
a
cathedral
here
also
and
i
presume
a
bishop
the
former
is
built
after
the
spanish
fashion
and
boasts
a
handsome
large
marble
pulpit
that
it
is
large
and
marble
i
confess
but
i
venture
to
question
its
claims
to
the
other
epithet
there
are
pictures
also
in
the
cathedral
of
spirits
in
a
state
of
torture
certainly
and
if
i
rightly
remember
of
beatified
spirits
also
but
in
such
pictures
the
agonies
of
the
damned
always
excite
more
attention
and
a
keener
remembrance
than
the
ecstasies
of
the
blest
i
can
not
say
that
the
artist
had
come
up
either
to
the
spirit
of
fra
angelico
or
to
the
strength
of
orcagna
at
cartagena
i
encountered
a
family
of
native
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
journeying
from
bogotá
to
peru
looking
at
the
map
one
would
say
that
the
route
from
bogotá
to
on
the
pacific
was
both
easy
and
short
the
distance
as
the
crow
flies
the
condor
i
should
perhaps
more
properly
say
would
not
be
much
over
two
hundred
miles
and
yet
this
family
of
whom
one
was
an
old
woman
had
come
down
to
cartagena
having
been
twenty
days
on
the
road
having
from
thence
a
long
sea
journey
to
the
isthmus
thence
the
passage
over
it
to
panamá
and
then
the
journey
down
the
pacific
the
fact
of
course
is
that
there
are
no
means
of
transit
in
the
country
except
on
certain
tracks
very
few
in
number
and
that
even
on
these
all
motion
is
very
difficult
bogotá
is
about
three
hundred
and
seventy
miles
from
cartagena
and
the
journey
can
hardly
be
made
in
less
than
fourteen
days
from
cartagena
i
went
on
to
the
isthmus
the
isthmus
of
panamá
as
it
is
called
by
all
the
world
though
the
american
town
of
aspinwall
will
gradually
become
the
name
best
known
in
connexion
with
the
passage
between
the
two
oceans
this
passage
is
now
made
by
a
railway
which
has
been
opened
by
an
american
company
between
the
town
of
aspinwall
or
colon
as
it
is
called
in
england
and
the
city
of
panamá
colon
is
the
local
name
for
this
place
which
also
bears
the
denomination
of
navy
bay
in
the
language
of
sailors
but
our
friends
from
like
to
carry
things
with
a
high
hand
and
to
have
a
nomenclature
of
their
own
here
as
their
energy
and
their
money
and
their
habits
are
undoubtedly
in
the
ascendant
they
will
probably
be
successful
and
the
place
will
be
called
aspinwall
in
spite
of
the
disgust
of
the
new
granadians
and
the
propriety
of
the
english
who
choose
to
adhere
to
the
names
of
the
existing
government
of
the
country
a
rose
by
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
and
colon
or
aspinwall
will
be
equally
vile
however
you
may
call
it
it
is
a
wretched
unhealthy
miserably
situated
but
thriving
little
american
town
created
by
and
for
the
railway
and
the
passenger
traffic
which
comes
here
both
from
southampton
and
new
york
that
from
new
york
is
of
course
immensely
the
greatest
for
this
is
at
present
the
main
route
to
san
francisco
and
california
i
visited
the
place
three
times
for
i
passed
over
the
isthmus
on
my
way
to
costa
rica
and
on
my
return
from
that
country
i
went
again
to
panamá
and
of
course
back
to
colon
i
can
say
nothing
in
its
favour
my
only
dealing
there
was
with
a
washerwoman
and
i
wish
i
could
place
before
my
readers
a
picture
of
my
linen
in
the
condition
in
which
it
came
back
from
that
artist
hands
i
confess
that
i
sat
down
and
shed
bitter
tears
in
these
localities
there
are
but
two
luxuries
of
life
iced
and
clean
shirts
and
now
i
was
debarred
from
any
true
enjoyment
of
the
latter
for
more
than
a
fortnight
the
panamá
railway
is
certainly
a
great
fact
as
men
say
when
anything
of
importance
is
accomplished
the
necessity
of
some
means
of
passing
the
isthmus
and
the
question
as
to
the
best
means
has
been
debated
since
i
may
say
the
days
of
cortes
men
have
foreseen
that
it
would
become
a
necessity
to
the
world
that
there
should
be
some
such
transit
and
every
conceivable
point
of
the
isthmus
has
at
some
period
or
by
some
nation
been
selected
as
the
best
for
the
purpose
this
railway
is
certainly
the
first
that
can
be
regarded
as
a
properly
organized
means
of
travelling
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
it
will
not
remain
as
the
best
if
not
the
only
permanent
mode
of
transit
very
great
difficulty
was
experienced
in
erecting
this
line
in
the
first
place
it
was
necessary
that
terms
should
be
made
with
the
government
of
the
country
through
which
the
line
should
pass
and
to
effect
this
it
was
expedient
to
hold
out
great
inducements
among
the
chief
of
these
is
an
understanding
that
the
whole
line
shall
become
the
absolute
property
of
the
new
granadian
government
when
it
shall
have
been
opened
for
years
but
who
can
tell
what
government
will
prevail
in
new
granada
in
years
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
whole
district
may
then
be
an
outlying
territory
belonging
to
the
united
states
at
any
rate
i
should
imagine
that
it
is
very
far
from
the
intention
of
the
american
company
to
adhere
with
rigid
strictness
to
this
part
of
the
bargain
who
knows
what
may
occur
between
this
and
the
end
of
the
century
and
when
these
terms
were
made
there
was
great
difficulty
in
obtaining
labour
the
road
had
to
be
cut
through
one
continuous
forest
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
along
the
course
of
the
chagres
river
nothing
could
be
more
unhealthy
than
such
work
and
in
consequence
the
men
died
very
rapidly
the
high
rate
of
wages
enticed
many
irishmen
here
but
most
of
them
found
their
graves
amidst
the
works
chinese
were
tried
but
they
were
quite
inefficacious
for
such
labour
and
when
distressed
had
a
habit
of
hanging
themselves
the
most
useful
men
were
to
be
got
from
the
coast
round
cartagena
but
they
were
enticed
thither
only
by
very
high
pay
the
whole
road
lies
through
trees
and
bushes
of
thick
tropical
growth
and
is
in
this
way
pretty
and
interesting
but
there
is
nothing
wonderful
in
the
scenery
unless
to
one
who
has
never
before
witnessed
tropical
forest
scenery
the
growth
here
is
so
quick
that
the
strip
of
ground
closely
adjacent
to
the
line
some
twenty
yards
perhaps
on
each
side
has
to
be
cleared
of
timber
and
foliage
every
six
months
if
left
for
twelve
months
the
whole
would
be
covered
with
thick
bushes
twelve
feet
high
at
intervals
of
four
and
a
half
miles
there
are
large
wooden
houses
houses
they
are
built
with
much
taste
in
each
of
which
a
superintendent
with
a
certain
number
of
labourers
resides
these
men
are
supplied
with
provisions
and
all
necessaries
by
the
company
for
there
are
no
villages
here
in
which
workmen
can
live
no
shops
from
which
they
can
supply
themselves
no
labour
which
can
be
hired
as
it
may
be
wanted
from
this
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
line
is
maintained
at
a
great
cost
but
nevertheless
it
already
pays
a
dividend
of
twelve
and
a
half
per
cent
so
much
at
least
is
acknowledged
but
those
who
pretend
to
understand
the
matter
declare
that
the
real
profit
accruing
to
the
shareholders
is
hardly
less
than
per
cent
the
sum
charged
for
the
passage
is
extremely
high
being
dollars
or
five
pounds
for
a
single
ticket
the
distance
is
under
fifty
miles
and
there
is
no
class
but
the
one
everybody
passing
over
the
isthmus
if
he
pay
his
fare
must
pay
dollars
steerage
passengers
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
are
at
present
booked
through
for
fifty
dollars
this
includes
their
food
on
the
two
sea
voyages
which
are
on
an
average
of
about
eleven
days
each
and
yet
out
of
this
fifty
dollars
are
paid
to
the
railway
for
this
conveyance
over
fifty
miles
the
charge
for
luggage
too
is
commensurately
high
the
ordinary
kit
of
a
travelling
englishman
a
portmanteau
bag
desk
and
would
cost
two
pounds
ten
shillings
over
and
above
his
own
fare
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
can
be
more
liberal
than
the
general
management
of
the
line
on
passengers
journeying
from
new
york
to
california
or
from
southampton
to
chili
and
peru
their
demand
no
doubt
is
very
high
but
to
men
of
all
classes
merely
travelling
from
aspinwall
to
panamá
for
pleasure
or
apparently
on
business
if
travelling
only
between
those
two
places
free
tickets
are
given
almost
without
restriction
one
train
goes
each
way
daily
and
as
a
rule
most
of
the
passengers
are
carried
free
except
on
those
days
when
packets
have
arrived
at
either
terminus
on
my
first
passage
over
i
paid
my
fare
for
i
went
across
with
other
passengers
out
of
the
mail
packet
but
on
my
return
the
superintendent
not
only
gave
me
a
ticket
but
asked
me
whether
i
wanted
others
for
any
friends
the
line
is
a
single
line
throughout
panamá
has
doubtless
become
a
place
of
importance
to
englishmen
and
americans
and
its
name
is
very
familiar
to
our
ears
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
place
whose
glory
has
passed
away
it
was
a
large
spanish
town
strongly
fortified
with
some
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
now
its
fortifications
are
mostly
gone
its
churches
are
tumbling
to
the
ground
its
old
houses
have
so
tumbled
and
its
old
spanish
population
has
vanished
it
is
still
the
chief
city
of
a
state
and
a
congress
sits
there
there
is
a
governor
and
a
judge
and
there
are
elections
but
were
it
not
for
the
passengers
of
the
isthmus
there
would
soon
be
but
little
left
of
the
city
of
panamá
here
the
negro
race
abounds
and
among
the
common
people
the
negro
traits
are
stronger
and
more
marked
than
those
either
of
the
indians
or
spaniards
of
spanish
blood
among
the
natives
of
the
surrounding
country
there
seems
to
be
but
little
the
negroes
here
are
of
course
free
free
to
vote
for
their
own
governors
and
make
their
own
laws
and
consequently
they
are
often
very
troublesome
the
country
people
attacking
those
in
the
town
and
so
on
and
is
justice
ultimately
done
on
the
offenders
i
asked
well
sir
perhaps
not
justice
but
some
notice
is
taken
and
the
matter
is
smoothed
over
such
was
the
answer
there
is
a
spanish
cathedral
here
also
in
which
i
heard
a
very
organ
and
one
magnificent
tenor
voice
the
old
church
buildings
still
standing
here
are
not
without
pretence
and
are
interesting
from
the
dark
tawny
colour
of
the
stone
if
from
no
other
cause
i
should
guess
them
to
be
some
two
centuries
old
their
style
in
many
respects
resembles
that
which
is
so
generally
odious
to
an
englishman
eye
and
ear
under
the
title
of
renaissance
it
is
probably
an
offshoot
of
that
which
is
called
plateresque
in
the
south
of
spain
during
the
whole
time
that
i
was
at
panamá
the
thermometer
stood
at
something
above
ninety
in
calcutta
i
believe
it
is
often
as
high
as
one
hundred
and
ten
so
that
i
have
no
right
to
speak
of
the
extreme
heat
but
nevertheless
panamá
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
hottest
places
in
the
western
world
and
i
was
assured
while
there
that
weather
so
continuously
hot
for
the
hours
had
not
been
known
during
the
last
nine
years
the
rainy
season
should
have
commenced
by
this
time
the
early
part
of
may
but
it
had
not
done
so
and
it
appeared
that
when
the
rain
is
late
that
is
the
hottest
period
of
the
whole
year
the
heat
made
me
uncomfortable
but
never
made
me
ill
i
lost
all
pleasure
in
eating
and
indeed
in
everything
else
i
used
to
feel
a
craving
for
my
food
but
no
appetite
when
it
came
i
was
lethargic
as
though
from
repletion
when
i
did
eat
and
was
always
glad
when
my
watch
would
allow
me
to
go
to
bed
but
yet
i
was
never
ill
the
country
round
the
town
is
pretty
and
very
well
adapted
for
riding
there
are
large
open
savanahs
which
stretch
away
for
miles
and
miles
and
which
are
kept
as
for
cattle
these
are
not
flat
and
plain
but
are
broken
into
undulations
and
covered
here
and
there
with
forest
bushes
the
horses
here
are
taught
to
pace
that
is
move
with
the
two
off
legs
together
and
then
with
the
two
near
legs
the
motion
is
exceedingly
gentle
and
well
fitted
for
this
hot
climate
in
which
the
rougher
work
of
trotting
would
be
almost
too
much
for
the
energies
of
debilitated
mankind
the
same
pace
is
common
in
cuba
costa
rica
and
other
spanish
countries
in
the
west
off
from
panamá
a
few
miles
distant
in
the
western
ocean
there
are
various
picturesque
islands
on
two
of
these
are
the
depôts
of
two
great
companies
that
belonging
to
the
americans
which
carries
on
the
trade
to
california
and
an
english
company
whose
vessels
run
down
the
pacific
to
peru
and
chili
i
visited
toboga
in
which
are
the
of
the
latter
here
i
found
a
small
english
maritime
colony
with
a
little
town
of
their
own
composed
of
captains
doctors
engineers
officers
artificers
and
sailors
living
together
on
the
company
wages
and
as
regards
the
upper
classes
at
tables
provided
by
the
company
but
i
saw
there
no
women
of
any
description
i
beg
therefore
to
suggest
to
the
company
that
their
servants
would
probably
be
much
more
comfortable
if
the
institution
partook
less
of
the
monastic
order
if
as
is
probable
this
becomes
one
of
the
to
australia
then
another
large
ship
company
will
have
to
fix
its
quarters
here
chapter
xvii
central
america
panamá
to
san
josé
i
had
intended
to
embark
at
panamá
in
the
american
for
the
coast
of
central
america
in
that
case
i
should
have
gone
to
san
juan
del
sur
a
port
in
nicaragua
and
made
my
way
from
thence
across
the
lake
down
the
river
san
juan
to
san
juan
del
norte
now
called
greytown
on
the
atlantic
but
i
learnt
that
the
means
of
transit
through
nicaragua
had
been
so
utterly
destroyed
as
i
shall
explain
that
i
should
encounter
great
delay
in
getting
across
the
lake
and
as
i
found
that
one
of
our
steamers
the
was
immediately
about
to
start
from
panamá
to
on
the
coast
of
costa
rica
i
changed
my
mind
and
resolved
on
riding
through
costa
rica
to
greytown
and
accordingly
i
did
ride
through
costa
rica
my
first
work
was
to
make
petition
for
a
passage
in
the
which
was
accorded
to
me
without
difficulty
but
even
had
i
failed
here
i
should
have
adhered
to
the
same
plan
the
more
i
heard
of
costa
rica
the
more
i
was
convinced
that
that
republic
was
better
worth
a
visit
than
nicaragua
at
this
time
i
had
in
my
hands
a
pamphlet
written
by
belly
a
frenchman
who
is
or
says
that
he
is
going
to
make
a
ship
canal
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
according
to
him
the
only
paradise
now
left
on
earth
is
in
this
republic
of
costa
rica
so
i
shipped
myself
on
board
the
i
had
never
before
been
on
the
waters
of
the
pacific
now
when
one
premeditates
one
travels
sitting
by
the
domestic
fireside
one
is
apt
to
think
that
all
those
advancing
steps
into
new
worlds
will
be
taken
with
some
little
awe
some
feeling
of
amazement
at
finding
oneself
in
very
truth
so
far
distant
from
hyde
park
corner
the
pacific
i
was
absolutely
there
on
the
ocean
in
which
lie
the
sandwich
islands
queen
pomare
and
the
cannibals
but
no
i
had
no
such
feeling
my
only
solicitude
was
whether
my
clean
shirts
would
last
me
on
to
the
capital
of
costa
rica
and
in
travelling
these
are
the
things
which
really
occupy
the
mind
where
shall
i
sleep
is
there
anything
to
eat
can
i
have
my
clothes
washed
at
panamá
i
did
have
my
clothes
washed
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
but
i
had
to
pay
a
shilling
apiece
for
them
all
round
in
all
these
ports
in
new
granada
central
america
and
even
throughout
the
west
indies
the
luxury
which
is
the
most
expensive
in
proportion
to
its
cost
in
europe
is
the
washing
of
clothes
the
most
expensive
as
it
is
also
the
most
essential
but
i
must
not
omit
to
say
that
before
shipping
myself
in
the
i
called
on
the
officers
on
board
the
united
states
frigate
and
was
shown
over
that
vessel
i
am
not
a
very
good
judge
of
ships
and
can
only
say
that
the
officers
were
extremely
civil
the
sherry
very
good
and
the
guns
very
large
they
were
coaling
the
captain
told
me
and
he
professed
to
be
very
much
ashamed
of
the
dirt
had
i
not
been
told
so
i
should
not
have
known
that
the
ship
was
dirty
the
though
rated
only
as
a
frigate
having
guns
on
one
covered
deck
only
is
one
of
their
largest
and
has
been
regarded
by
them
and
by
us
as
a
show
vessel
but
according
to
their
own
account
she
fails
altogether
as
a
steamer
the
greatest
pace
her
engines
will
give
is
seven
knots
an
hour
and
this
is
felt
to
be
so
insufficient
for
the
wants
of
the
present
time
that
it
is
intended
to
take
them
out
of
her
and
replace
them
by
a
new
set
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
will
allow
this
will
be
done
although
the
vessel
and
the
engines
are
new
i
mention
this
not
as
reflecting
in
any
way
disgracefully
on
the
dockyard
from
whence
she
came
but
to
show
that
our
admiralty
is
not
the
only
one
which
may
have
to
chop
and
change
its
vessels
after
they
are
built
we
hear
much
too
much
perhaps
of
the
misfortunes
which
attend
our
own
navy
but
of
the
misfortunes
of
other
navies
we
hear
very
little
it
is
a
pity
that
we
can
not
have
some
record
of
all
the
blunders
committed
at
cherbourg
the
carries
the
flag
of
long
on
whom
also
we
called
he
is
a
fine
old
gentleman
with
a
magnificent
head
and
forehead
looking
i
should
say
much
more
like
an
english
nobleman
than
a
yankee
sailor
long
who
will
explain
to
us
why
the
americans
of
the
united
states
should
persist
in
calling
their
senior
naval
officers
by
so
awkward
an
appellation
seeing
that
the
and
title
of
admiral
is
very
much
at
their
disposal
when
i
returned
to
the
shore
from
the
i
had
half
an
hour
to
pack
before
i
again
started
for
the
as
it
would
be
necessary
that
i
should
return
to
panamá
and
as
whatever
luggage
i
now
took
with
me
would
have
to
be
carried
through
the
whole
of
costa
rica
on
mules
backs
it
became
expedient
that
i
should
leave
the
greater
part
of
my
kit
behind
me
then
came
the
painful
task
of
selection
to
be
carried
out
with
the
thermometer
at
ninety
and
to
be
completed
in
thirty
minutes
to
go
or
not
to
go
had
to
be
asked
and
answered
as
to
every
shirt
and
pair
of
trousers
oh
those
weary
clothes
if
a
man
could
travel
as
a
dog
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
keep
moving
from
year
end
to
year
end
we
steamed
up
the
coast
for
two
days
quietly
placidly
and
steadily
i
can
not
say
that
the
trip
was
a
pleasant
one
remembering
how
intense
was
the
heat
on
one
occasion
we
stopped
for
and
it
behoved
me
of
course
to
mount
the
and
see
what
was
going
on
this
was
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
though
it
did
not
last
for
above
an
hour
i
was
brought
almost
to
fainting
by
the
power
of
the
sun
sandy
point
is
a
small
town
and
harbour
situated
in
costa
rica
near
the
top
of
the
bay
of
nicoya
the
sail
up
the
bay
is
very
pretty
through
almost
endless
woods
stretching
away
from
the
shores
to
the
hills
there
is
however
nothing
majestic
or
grand
about
the
scenery
here
there
are
no
andes
in
sight
no
stupendous
mountains
such
as
one
might
expect
to
see
after
coming
so
far
to
see
them
it
is
all
pretty
quiet
and
ordinary
and
on
the
whole
perhaps
superior
to
the
views
from
the
sea
at
herne
bay
the
captain
of
the
had
decided
on
going
up
to
san
josé
with
me
as
at
the
last
moment
did
also
the
master
san
josé
being
the
capital
of
costa
rica
our
first
object
therefore
was
to
hire
a
guide
and
mules
which
with
the
assistance
of
the
acting
english
consul
we
soon
found
for
even
at
the
english
flag
flies
and
a
distressed
british
subject
can
claim
protection
it
is
a
small
village
lying
along
a
creek
of
the
sea
inside
the
sandy
point
from
whence
it
is
named
considerable
business
is
done
here
in
the
exportation
of
coffee
which
is
the
staple
produce
of
costa
rica
it
is
sent
chiefly
to
england
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
inhabitants
of
were
mostly
americans
men
who
either
had
been
to
california
or
who
had
got
so
far
on
their
road
thither
and
then
changed
their
minds
it
is
a
hot
dusty
unattractive
spot
with
a
yankee
inn
at
which
men
may
liquor
and
a
tram
railroad
running
for
twelve
miles
into
the
country
it
abounds
in
oysters
and
beer
on
which
we
dined
before
we
started
on
our
journey
i
was
thus
for
the
first
time
in
central
america
this
continent
if
it
may
be
so
called
comprises
the
five
republics
of
guatemala
honduras
san
salvador
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
when
this
country
first
broke
away
from
spanish
rule
in
it
was
for
a
while
content
to
exist
as
one
state
under
the
name
of
the
republic
of
guatemala
as
it
had
been
known
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
as
a
spanish
province
under
the
same
denomination
that
of
guatemala
after
a
hard
tussle
with
mexico
which
endeavoured
to
devour
it
and
which
forty
years
ago
was
more
prone
to
annex
than
to
be
annexed
this
republic
sat
itself
fairly
going
with
the
city
of
guatemala
for
its
capital
but
the
energies
and
ambition
of
the
different
races
comprised
among
the
two
million
inhabitants
of
central
america
would
not
allow
them
to
be
governed
except
each
in
its
own
province
some
ten
years
since
therefore
the
five
states
broke
asunder
each
claimed
to
be
sovereign
and
independent
each
chose
its
own
president
and
had
its
own
capital
and
consequently
as
might
be
expected
no
part
of
the
district
in
question
has
been
able
to
enjoy
those
natural
advantages
with
which
providence
has
certainly
endowed
it
to
these
states
must
be
added
in
counting
up
the
countries
of
central
america
british
honduras
consisting
of
belize
and
the
adjacent
district
and
the
mosquito
coast
which
so
lately
was
under
british
protection
and
which
is
but
here
i
must
be
silent
or
i
may
possibly
trench
upon
diplomatic
subjects
still
unsettled
my
visit
was
solely
to
costa
rica
which
has
in
some
respects
done
better
than
its
neighbours
but
this
has
been
owing
to
the
circumstances
of
its
soil
and
climate
rather
than
to
those
of
its
government
which
seems
to
me
to
be
as
bad
as
any
can
be
which
deserves
that
name
in
costa
rica
there
certainly
is
a
government
and
a
very
despotic
one
it
is
i
am
not
much
given
to
the
sins
of
dandyism
but
i
must
own
i
was
not
a
little
proud
of
my
costume
as
i
left
we
had
been
told
that
according
to
the
weather
our
ride
would
be
either
dusty
or
muddy
in
no
ordinary
degree
and
that
any
clothes
which
we
might
wear
during
the
journey
would
be
utterly
useless
as
soon
as
the
journey
was
over
consequently
we
purchased
for
ourselves
in
an
american
store
short
canvas
which
would
not
come
below
the
saddle
and
coarse
holland
trousers
what
class
of
men
may
usually
wear
these
garments
in
costa
rica
i
can
not
say
but
in
england
i
have
seen
navvies
look
exactly
as
my
naval
friends
looked
and
i
flatter
myself
that
my
appearance
was
quite
equal
to
theirs
i
had
procured
at
panamá
a
light
straw
hat
with
an
amazing
brim
and
had
covered
the
whole
with
white
calico
i
have
before
said
that
my
beard
had
become
poblada
so
that
on
the
whole
i
was
rather
gratified
than
otherwise
when
i
was
assured
by
the
storekeeper
that
we
should
certainly
be
taken
for
three
filibusters
now
the
name
of
filibuster
means
something
serious
in
those
localities
as
i
shall
in
a
few
pages
have
to
explain
we
started
on
our
journey
by
railroad
for
there
is
a
tramway
that
runs
for
twelve
miles
through
the
forest
we
were
dragged
along
on
this
by
an
excellent
mule
till
our
course
was
suddenly
impeded
by
a
tree
which
had
fallen
across
the
road
but
in
course
of
time
this
was
removed
and
in
something
less
than
three
hours
we
found
ourselves
at
a
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
the
first
thing
that
met
my
view
on
stepping
out
of
the
truck
was
a
solitary
englishman
seated
on
a
log
of
wood
those
who
remember
hood
whims
and
oddities
may
bear
in
mind
a
picture
of
the
last
man
only
that
the
times
do
not
agree
i
should
have
said
that
this
poor
fellow
must
have
sat
for
the
picture
he
was
undeniably
an
english
labourer
no
man
of
any
other
nation
would
have
had
that
face
or
worn
those
clothes
or
kicked
his
feet
about
in
that
same
awkward
melancholy
humour
he
was
he
said
in
charge
of
the
having
been
induced
to
come
out
into
that
country
for
three
years
according
to
him
it
was
a
wretched
miserable
place
no
man
he
said
ever
found
himself
in
worse
diggings
he
earned
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
and
with
that
he
could
hardly
buy
shoes
and
have
his
clothes
washed
why
did
he
not
go
home
i
asked
oh
he
had
come
for
three
years
and
stay
his
three
years
out
if
so
be
he
did
die
the
was
not
paying
he
said
and
never
would
pay
so
that
on
the
whole
his
account
of
costa
rica
was
not
encouraging
we
had
been
recommended
to
stay
the
first
night
at
a
place
called
esparza
where
there
is
a
decent
inn
but
before
we
left
we
learnt
that
don
juan
rafael
mora
the
president
of
the
republic
was
coming
down
the
same
road
with
a
large
retinue
of
followers
to
inaugurate
the
commencement
of
the
works
of
the
canal
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
meet
his
of
the
next
republic
nicaragua
at
san
juan
del
sur
and
at
a
spot
some
little
distance
from
thence
this
great
work
was
to
be
begun
at
once
he
and
his
party
were
to
sleep
at
esparza
therefore
we
decided
on
going
on
further
before
we
halted
and
in
truth
at
that
place
we
did
meet
don
juan
and
his
retinue
as
both
costa
rica
and
nicaragua
are
chiefly
of
importance
to
the
eastern
and
western
worlds
as
being
the
district
in
which
the
isthmus
between
the
two
americas
may
be
most
advantageously
pierced
by
a
canal
if
it
be
ever
so
pierced
this
subject
naturally
intrudes
itself
into
all
matters
concerning
these
countries
till
the
opening
of
the
panamá
railway
the
transit
of
passengers
through
nicaragua
was
immense
at
present
the
railway
has
it
all
its
own
way
but
the
subject
connected
as
it
has
been
with
that
of
filibustering
mingles
itself
so
completely
with
all
interests
in
costa
rica
that
nothing
of
its
present
doings
or
politics
can
be
well
understood
till
something
is
understood
on
this
canal
subject
sooner
or
later
i
must
write
a
chapter
on
it
and
it
would
almost
be
well
if
the
reader
would
be
pleased
to
take
it
out
of
its
turn
and
get
through
it
at
once
the
chapter
however
can
not
well
be
brought
in
till
these
recording
my
travels
in
costa
rica
are
completed
don
juan
mora
and
his
retinue
had
arrived
some
hours
before
us
and
had
nearly
filled
the
little
hotel
this
was
kept
by
a
frenchman
and
as
far
as
provisions
and
beer
were
concerned
seemed
to
be
well
kept
our
requirements
did
not
go
beyond
these
on
entering
the
public
a
melodiously
rich
irish
brogue
at
once
greeted
my
ears
and
i
saw
seated
at
the
table
joyous
in
a
uniform
the
mahon
great
as
in
bygone
unemancipated
days
when
with
head
erect
and
stentorian
voice
he
would
make
himself
audible
to
half
the
county
clare
the
head
was
still
as
erect
and
the
brogue
as
unexceptionable
he
speedily
introduced
us
to
a
in
the
same
mission
the
prince
polignac
with
the
president
himself
i
had
not
the
honour
of
making
acquaintance
for
he
speaks
only
spanish
and
my
tether
in
that
language
is
unfortunately
very
short
but
the
captain
of
the
was
presented
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
a
courteous
little
gentleman
though
rather
flustered
by
the
magnitude
of
the
work
on
which
he
was
engaged
there
was
something
singular
in
the
amalgamation
of
the
three
men
who
had
thus
got
themselves
together
in
this
place
to
do
honour
to
the
coming
canal
the
president
of
the
republic
prince
polignac
and
the
mahon
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
heterogeneous
heroes
of
the
of
blarney
there
were
nicodemus
and
polyphemus
oliver
cromwell
and
leslie
foster
am
not
quoting
the
words
rightly
i
fear
but
the
selection
in
the
true
song
is
miscellaneous
in
the
same
degree
and
now
boys
ate
a
bit
of
what
going
and
take
a
dhrop
of
dhrink
said
the
patting
us
on
the
shoulders
with
kind
patronage
we
did
as
we
were
bid
ate
and
drank
paid
the
bill
and
went
our
way
rejoicing
that
night
or
the
next
morning
rather
at
about
we
reached
a
wayside
inn
called
san
mateo
and
there
rested
for
five
or
six
hours
that
we
should
obtain
any
such
accommodation
along
the
road
astonished
me
and
of
such
as
we
got
we
were
very
glad
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
it
was
of
a
very
excellent
quality
we
found
three
bedsteads
in
the
front
room
into
which
the
door
of
the
house
opened
on
these
were
no
mattresses
not
even
a
palliasse
they
consisted
of
flat
boards
sloping
away
a
little
towards
the
feet
with
some
hard
substance
prepared
for
a
pillow
in
the
morning
we
got
a
cup
of
coffee
without
milk
for
these
luxuries
and
for
pasturage
for
the
mules
we
paid
about
ten
shillings
a
head
indeed
everything
of
this
kind
in
costa
rica
is
excessively
dear
our
next
day
journey
was
a
very
long
one
and
to
my
companions
very
fatiguing
for
they
had
not
latterly
been
so
much
on
horseback
as
had
been
the
case
with
myself
our
first
stage
before
breakfast
was
of
some
five
hours
duration
and
from
the
questions
put
to
the
guide
as
to
the
number
of
remaining
leagues
it
seemed
to
be
eternal
the
weather
also
was
hot
for
we
had
not
yet
got
into
the
high
lands
and
a
continued
seat
of
five
hours
on
a
mule
under
a
burning
sun
is
not
refreshing
to
a
man
who
is
not
accustomed
to
such
exercise
and
especially
is
not
so
when
he
is
unaccustomed
to
the
steps
of
the
beast
the
spaniard
sits
in
the
saddle
without
moving
and
generally
has
his
saddle
well
stuffed
and
padded
and
then
covered
with
a
pillion
an
englishman
disdains
so
soft
a
seat
and
endeavours
to
rise
in
his
stirrup
at
every
step
of
the
mule
as
he
would
on
a
trotting
horse
at
home
in
these
countries
this
always
provokes
the
ridicule
of
the
guide
who
does
not
hesitate
to
tell
the
poor
wretch
who
is
suffering
in
his
pillory
that
he
does
not
know
how
to
ride
with
some
of
us
the
pillory
was
very
bad
and
i
feared
for
a
time
that
we
should
hardly
have
been
able
to
mount
again
after
breakfast
the
place
at
which
we
were
is
called
atenas
and
i
must
say
in
praise
of
this
modern
athens
and
of
the
three
modern
athenian
girls
who
waited
on
us
that
their
coffee
eggs
and
grilled
fowl
were
very
good
the
houses
of
these
people
are
exceedingly
dirty
their
modes
of
living
comfortless
and
slovenly
in
the
extreme
but
there
seems
to
be
no
lack
of
food
and
the
food
is
by
no
means
of
a
bad
description
along
this
road
from
to
san
jose
we
found
it
always
supplied
in
large
quantities
and
fairly
cooked
the
prices
demanded
for
it
were
generally
high
but
then
all
prices
are
high
and
it
seems
that
even
among
the
poorer
classes
small
sums
of
money
are
not
valued
as
with
us
there
is
no
copper
coin
half
a
rial
equal
to
about
threepence
is
the
smallest
piece
in
use
a
handful
of
rials
hardly
seems
to
go
further
or
to
be
thought
more
of
than
a
handful
of
pence
with
us
and
a
dollar
eight
rials
ranks
hardly
higher
in
estimation
than
a
shilling
does
in
england
at
last
by
the
gradual
use
of
the
coffee
and
eggs
and
by
the
application
external
and
internal
of
a
limited
amount
of
brandy
the
outward
and
the
inward
men
were
recruited
and
we
once
more
found
ourselves
on
the
backs
of
our
mules
prepared
for
another
stage
of
equal
duration
these
evils
always
lessen
as
we
become
more
accustomed
to
them
so
that
when
we
reached
a
place
called
assumption
at
which
we
were
to
rest
for
the
night
we
all
gallantly
informed
the
muleteer
that
we
were
prepared
to
do
another
stage
not
so
the
mules
said
the
muleteer
and
as
his
words
were
law
we
prepared
to
spend
the
night
at
assumption
our
road
hitherto
had
been
rising
nearly
the
whole
way
and
had
been
generally
through
a
picturesque
country
we
ascended
one
long
severe
hill
severe
that
is
as
a
road
though
to
a
professed
climber
of
mountains
it
would
be
as
nothing
from
the
summit
of
this
hill
we
had
a
magnificent
view
down
to
the
pacific
again
at
a
sort
of
fortress
through
which
we
passed
and
which
must
have
been
first
placed
there
by
the
old
spaniards
to
guard
the
we
found
a
very
lovely
landscape
looking
down
into
the
valley
here
some
show
of
a
demand
was
made
for
passports
but
we
had
none
to
exhibit
and
no
opposition
was
made
to
our
progress
except
at
these
two
places
the
scenery
which
was
always
more
or
less
pretty
was
never
remarkable
and
even
at
the
two
points
named
there
was
nothing
to
equal
the
mountain
scenery
of
many
countries
in
europe
what
struck
me
most
was
the
constant
traffic
on
the
road
or
track
over
which
we
passed
i
believe
i
may
call
it
a
road
for
the
produce
of
the
country
is
brought
down
over
it
in
bullock
carts
and
i
think
that
in
south
wales
i
have
taken
a
gig
over
one
very
much
of
the
same
description
but
it
is
extremely
rude
and
only
fit
for
solid
wooden
wheels
circles
in
fact
of
timber
such
as
are
used
and
for
the
patient
slow
step
of
the
bullocks
but
during
the
morning
and
evening
hours
the
strings
of
these
bullock
carts
were
incessant
they
travel
from
four
till
ten
then
rest
till
three
or
four
and
again
proceed
for
four
or
five
hours
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
they
are
all
laden
with
coffee
and
the
idea
they
give
is
that
the
growth
of
that
article
in
costa
rica
must
be
much
more
than
sufficient
to
supply
the
whole
world
for
miles
and
miles
we
met
them
almost
without
any
interval
coffee
coffee
coffee
coffee
coffee
coffee
it
is
grown
in
large
quantities
i
believe
only
in
the
high
lands
of
san
josé
and
all
that
is
exported
is
sent
down
to
though
by
travelling
this
route
it
must
either
pass
across
the
isthmus
railway
at
a
vast
cost
or
else
be
carried
round
the
horn
at
present
half
goes
one
way
and
half
the
other
but
not
a
grain
is
carried
as
it
should
all
be
carried
direct
to
the
atlantic
when
i
come
to
speak
of
the
road
from
san
josé
to
greytown
the
reason
for
this
will
be
understood
the
bivouacs
made
on
the
roadside
by
the
bullock
drivers
for
their
night
and
noon
accommodation
are
very
picturesque
when
seen
filled
by
the
animals
a
piece
of
flat
ground
is
selected
by
the
roadside
about
half
an
acre
in
size
and
close
to
a
river
or
some
running
water
into
this
one
or
two
hundred
bullocks
are
taken
and
then
released
from
their
carts
but
they
are
kept
yoked
together
to
prevent
their
straying
here
they
are
fed
exclusively
on
which
the
men
carry
with
them
and
buy
along
the
road
the
drovers
patiently
cut
the
canes
up
with
their
knives
and
the
beasts
patiently
munch
them
neither
the
men
nor
the
animals
roar
as
they
would
with
us
or
squabble
for
the
use
of
the
or
curse
their
own
ill
luck
or
the
good
luck
of
their
neighbours
drivers
and
driven
are
alike
orderly
patient
and
slow
spending
their
lives
in
taking
coffee
down
to
and
in
cutting
and
munching
thousands
of
we
passed
some
of
those
establishments
by
moonlight
and
they
looked
like
large
crowded
fairs
full
of
low
small
booths
the
men
however
do
not
put
up
tents
but
sleep
out
in
their
carts
they
told
me
that
the
soil
in
costa
rica
was
very
favourable
to
the
and
i
looked
out
to
see
some
sugar
among
the
coffee
but
not
a
hogshead
came
that
way
we
saw
patches
of
the
cane
growing
by
the
roadside
but
no
more
was
produced
than
what
sufficed
for
the
use
of
the
proprietor
himself
and
for
such
sale
as
the
traffic
on
the
road
afforded
indeed
i
found
that
they
do
not
make
sugar
so
called
in
costa
rica
but
import
what
they
use
the
article
fabricated
is
called
by
them
dulce
it
comes
from
their
hands
in
ugly
round
brown
lumps
of
the
consistency
of
brick
looking
in
truth
much
more
like
a
large
brickbat
than
any
possible
saccharine
arrangement
nevertheless
the
canes
are
fairly
good
and
the
juice
as
sweet
as
that
produced
in
soils
it
seemed
that
the
only
use
made
of
this
dulce
excepting
that
of
sweetening
the
coffee
of
the
peasants
is
for
distillation
a
spirit
is
made
from
it
at
san
josé
called
by
the
generic
name
of
aguardiente
and
this
doubtless
would
give
considerable
impulse
to
the
growth
of
but
for
a
little
law
made
on
the
subject
by
the
present
president
of
the
republic
the
president
himself
is
a
and
by
this
law
it
is
enacted
that
the
only
person
in
costa
rica
entitled
to
supply
the
distillery
with
dulce
shall
be
don
juan
mora
now
don
juan
mora
is
the
president
before
i
left
the
country
i
came
across
an
american
who
was
desirous
of
settling
there
with
the
view
of
producing
cocoa
well
said
i
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
why
i
like
the
diggings
said
he
and
guess
i
could
make
things
fix
well
enough
but
suppose
the
president
should
choose
to
grow
all
the
cocoa
as
well
as
all
the
gin
where
would
my
be
then
at
a
discount
undoubtedly
these
are
the
effects
on
a
country
of
despotism
in
a
small
way
on
my
way
into
san
josé
i
got
off
my
mule
to
look
at
an
old
peasant
making
dulce
or
in
other
words
grinding
his
by
the
roadside
it
was
done
in
the
most
primitive
manner
one
bullock
turned
the
mill
which
consisted
of
three
vertical
wooden
rollers
the
juice
trickled
into
a
little
cistern
and
as
soon
as
the
old
man
found
that
he
had
enough
he
baled
it
out
and
boiled
it
down
and
yet
i
imagine
that
as
good
sugar
may
be
made
in
costa
rica
as
in
british
guiana
but
who
will
put
his
capital
into
a
country
in
which
the
president
can
pass
any
law
he
pleases
on
his
own
behalf
in
the
neighbourhood
of
san
josé
we
began
to
come
across
the
coffee
plantations
they
certainly
give
the
best
existing
proof
of
the
fertility
and
progress
of
the
country
i
had
seen
coffee
plantations
in
jamaica
but
there
they
are
beautifully
picturesque
placed
like
hanging
gardens
on
the
steep
some
of
these
seem
to
be
almost
inaccessible
and
the
plant
always
has
the
appearance
of
being
a
hardy
mountain
shrub
but
here
in
costa
rica
it
is
grown
on
the
plain
the
secret
i
presume
is
that
a
certain
temperature
is
necessary
and
that
this
is
afforded
by
a
certain
altitude
from
the
sea
in
jamaica
this
altitude
is
only
to
be
found
among
the
mountains
but
it
is
attained
in
costa
rica
on
the
high
plains
of
the
interior
and
then
we
jogged
slowly
into
san
josé
on
the
third
day
after
our
departure
from
slowly
sorely
and
with
minds
much
preoccupied
we
jogged
into
san
josé
on
leaving
the
at
the
end
of
the
tramway
my
two
friends
had
galloped
gallantly
away
into
the
forest
as
though
a
brave
heart
and
a
sharp
pair
of
spurs
would
have
sufficed
to
carry
them
right
through
to
their
journey
end
but
the
muleteer
with
his
pony
and
the
then
lingered
far
behind
his
heart
was
not
so
brave
nor
were
his
spurs
apparently
so
sharp
the
luggage
too
was
slipping
every
ten
minutes
for
i
unfortunately
had
a
portmanteau
of
which
no
muleteer
could
ever
make
anything
it
has
been
condemned
in
holy
land
in
jamaica
in
costa
rica
wherever
it
has
had
to
be
fixed
upon
any
animal
back
on
this
occasion
it
nearly
broke
both
the
heart
of
the
muleteer
and
the
back
of
the
mule
but
things
were
changed
as
we
crept
into
san
josé
the
muleteer
was
all
life
and
led
the
way
driving
before
him
the
now
at
length
reconciled
to
his
load
and
then
at
straggling
intervals
our
jibes
all
silenced
our
showy
canters
all
done
rising
wearily
in
our
stirrups
at
every
step
shifting
from
side
to
side
to
ease
the
galls
that
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
for
our
merit
had
been
very
patient
and
our
saddles
very
unworthy
we
jogged
into
san
josé
chapter
xviii
central
america
costa
rica
san
josé
all
travellers
when
entering
unknown
towns
for
the
first
time
have
felt
that
intense
interest
on
the
subject
of
hotel
accommodation
which
pervaded
our
hearts
as
we
followed
our
guide
through
the
streets
we
had
been
told
that
there
were
two
inns
in
the
town
and
that
we
were
to
go
to
the
hotel
san
josé
and
accordingly
we
went
to
it
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
landlord
at
first
had
some
little
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
admitting
us
and
but
for
our
guide
whom
he
knew
we
should
have
had
to
explain
at
some
length
who
we
were
but
under
his
auspices
we
were
taken
in
without
much
question
the
spaniards
themselves
are
not
in
their
own
country
at
all
famous
for
their
inns
no
european
nation
has
probably
advanced
so
slowly
towards
civilization
in
this
respect
as
spain
has
done
and
therefore
as
these
costa
ricans
are
spanish
by
descent
and
language
and
as
the
country
itself
is
so
far
removed
from
european
civilization
we
did
not
expect
much
had
we
fallen
into
the
hands
of
spaniards
we
should
probably
have
received
less
even
than
we
expected
but
as
it
was
we
found
ourselves
in
a
comfortable
little
german
inn
it
was
german
in
everything
its
landlord
frequently
to
be
seen
with
a
beer
tankard
in
hand
its
tidy
landlady
tidy
at
any
rate
in
the
evening
if
not
always
so
in
the
morning
its
early
hours
its
cookery
its
drink
and
i
think
i
may
fairly
add
its
prices
on
entering
the
first
town
i
had
visited
in
central
america
i
had
of
course
looked
about
me
for
strange
sights
that
men
should
be
found
with
their
heads
under
their
shoulders
or
even
living
in
holes
burrowed
in
the
ground
i
had
not
ventured
to
hope
but
when
a
man
has
travelled
all
the
way
to
costa
rica
he
does
expect
something
strange
he
does
not
look
to
find
everything
as
tame
and
flat
and
uninteresting
as
though
he
were
riding
into
a
sleepy
little
borough
town
in
wiltshire
we
can
not
cross
from
dover
to
ostend
without
finding
at
once
that
we
are
among
a
set
of
people
foreign
to
ourselves
the
first
glance
of
the
eye
shows
this
in
the
architecture
of
the
houses
and
the
costume
of
the
people
we
find
the
same
cause
for
excitement
in
france
switzerland
and
italy
and
when
we
get
as
far
as
the
tyrol
we
come
upon
a
genus
of
mankind
so
essentially
differing
from
our
own
as
to
make
us
feel
that
we
have
travelled
indeed
but
there
is
little
more
interest
to
be
found
in
entering
san
josé
than
in
driving
through
the
little
wiltshire
town
above
alluded
to
the
houses
are
comfortable
enough
they
are
built
with
very
ordinary
doors
and
windows
of
one
or
two
stories
according
to
the
wealth
of
the
owners
and
are
decently
clean
outside
though
apparently
rather
dirty
within
the
streets
are
broad
and
straight
being
all
at
right
angles
to
each
other
and
though
not
very
well
paved
are
not
rough
enough
to
elicit
admiration
there
is
a
square
the
pláza
in
which
stands
the
cathedral
the
barracks
and
a
few
of
the
best
houses
in
the
town
there
is
a
large
and
tolerably
there
is
a
really
handsome
set
of
public
buildings
and
there
are
two
moderately
good
hotels
what
more
can
a
man
rationally
want
if
he
travel
for
business
and
if
he
travel
for
pleasure
how
can
he
possibly
find
less
it
so
happened
that
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
costa
rica
sir
william
ouseley
was
staying
at
san
josé
with
his
family
he
had
been
sent
as
all
the
world
that
knows
anything
doubtless
knows
very
well
as
minister
extraordinary
from
our
court
to
the
governments
of
central
america
with
the
view
of
settling
some
of
those
tough
diplomatic
questions
as
to
the
rights
of
transit
and
occupation
of
territory
respecting
which
such
treaties
and
treaties
have
been
made
and
talked
of
he
had
been
in
nicaragua
making
no
doubt
an
equally
famous
treaty
and
was
now
engaged
on
similar
business
in
the
capital
of
costa
rica
of
the
nature
of
this
august
work
for
such
work
must
be
very
august
i
know
nothing
i
only
hope
that
he
may
have
at
least
as
much
success
as
those
who
went
before
him
but
to
me
it
was
a
great
stroke
of
luck
to
find
so
pleasant
and
hospitable
a
family
in
so
outlandish
a
place
as
san
josé
and
indeed
though
i
have
given
praise
to
the
hotel
i
have
given
it
with
very
little
personal
warrant
as
regards
my
knowledge
either
of
the
kitchen
or
cellar
my
kitchen
and
cellar
were
beneath
the
british
flag
at
the
corner
of
the
pláza
and
i
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
them
in
every
respect
and
i
had
abundant
reason
to
be
greatly
gratified
for
not
only
was
there
at
san
josé
a
minister
extraordinary
but
also
attached
to
the
mission
there
was
an
secretary
of
legation
a
very
prince
of
good
fellows
at
home
he
would
be
a
denizen
of
the
foreign
office
and
denizens
of
the
foreign
office
are
swells
at
home
but
at
san
josé
where
he
rode
on
a
mule
and
wore
a
straw
hat
and
slept
in
a
linendraper
shop
he
was
as
pleasant
a
companion
as
a
man
would
wish
to
meet
on
the
western
or
indeed
on
any
other
side
of
the
atlantic
i
shall
never
forget
the
hours
i
spent
in
that
linendraper
shop
the
rooms
over
the
shop
over
that
shop
and
over
two
or
three
others
were
occupied
by
sir
ouseley
and
his
family
there
was
a
establishment
there
and
another
in
the
possession
i
think
of
a
hatter
they
had
been
left
to
pursue
their
business
in
peace
but
my
friend
the
secretary
finding
no
rooms
sufficiently
secluded
for
himself
in
the
upper
mansion
had
managed
to
expel
the
haberdasher
and
had
located
himself
not
altogether
uncomfortably
among
the
counters
those
who
have
spent
two
or
three
weeks
in
some
foreign
town
in
which
they
have
no
ordinary
pursuits
know
what
it
is
to
have
or
perhaps
more
unlucky
know
what
it
is
to
be
without
some
pleasant
accustomed
haunt
in
which
they
can
pretend
to
read
while
in
truth
the
hours
are
passed
in
talking
with
some
few
short
intervals
devoted
to
contemplation
and
tobacco
such
to
me
was
the
shop
of
the
expelled
linendraper
at
san
josé
in
it
judiciously
suspended
among
the
counters
hung
a
panamá
grass
hammock
in
which
it
was
the
custom
of
my
diplomatic
friend
to
lie
at
length
and
meditate
his
despatches
such
at
least
had
been
his
custom
before
my
arrival
what
became
of
his
despatches
during
the
period
of
my
stay
it
pains
me
to
think
for
in
that
hammock
i
had
soon
located
myself
and
i
fear
that
my
presence
was
not
found
to
be
a
salutary
incentive
to
composition
the
scenery
round
san
josé
is
certainly
striking
but
not
sufficiently
so
to
enable
one
to
rave
about
it
i
can
not
justly
go
into
an
ecstasy
and
sing
of
pelion
or
ossa
nor
can
i
talk
of
deep
ravines
to
which
the
via
mala
is
as
nothing
there
is
a
range
of
hills
respectably
broken
into
prettinesses
running
nearly
round
the
town
though
much
closer
to
it
on
the
southern
than
on
the
other
sides
two
little
rivers
run
by
it
which
here
and
there
fall
into
romantic
pools
or
pools
which
would
be
romantic
if
they
were
not
so
very
distant
from
home
if
having
travelled
so
far
one
did
not
expect
so
very
much
there
are
nice
walks
too
and
pretty
rides
only
the
mules
do
not
like
fast
trotting
when
the
weight
upon
them
is
heavy
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
town
there
is
a
savanah
or
large
square
park
the
hyde
park
of
san
josé
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
pleasant
place
for
a
gallop
it
is
quite
large
enough
for
a
and
is
open
to
everybody
some
part
of
the
mountain
range
as
seen
from
here
is
really
beautiful
the
valley
of
san
josé
as
it
is
called
is
four
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
and
consequently
though
within
the
tropics
and
only
ten
degrees
north
of
the
line
the
climate
is
good
and
the
heat
i
believe
never
excessive
i
was
there
in
april
and
at
that
time
except
for
a
few
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
that
only
on
some
days
there
was
nothing
like
tropical
heat
within
ten
days
of
my
leaving
san
josé
i
heard
natives
at
panamá
complaining
of
the
heat
as
being
altogether
unendurable
but
up
there
on
that
high
plateau
the
sun
had
no
strength
that
was
inconvenient
even
to
an
englishman
indeed
no
climate
can
i
imagine
be
more
favourable
to
fertility
and
to
man
comfort
at
the
same
time
than
that
of
the
interior
of
costa
rica
the
comes
to
maturity
much
quicker
than
in
demerara
or
cuba
there
it
should
be
cut
in
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
months
from
the
time
it
is
planted
in
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
it
comes
to
perfection
in
nine
or
ten
the
ground
without
manure
will
afford
two
crops
of
corn
in
a
year
coffee
grows
in
great
perfection
and
gives
a
very
heavy
crop
the
soil
is
all
volcanic
or
i
should
perhaps
more
properly
say
has
been
the
produce
of
volcanoes
and
is
indescribably
fertile
and
all
this
has
been
given
without
that
intensity
of
heat
which
in
those
southern
regions
generally
accompanies
tropical
fertility
and
which
makes
hard
work
fatal
to
a
white
man
while
it
creates
lethargy
and
idleness
and
neutralizes
gifts
which
would
otherwise
be
regarded
as
the
fairest
which
god
has
bestowed
on
his
creatures
in
speaking
thus
i
refer
to
the
central
parts
of
costa
rica
only
to
those
which
lie
some
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
along
the
both
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
the
heat
is
as
great
and
the
climate
as
unwholesome
as
in
new
granada
or
the
west
indies
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
place
worse
circumstanced
in
this
respect
than
but
though
the
valley
or
plateau
of
san
josé
and
the
interior
of
the
country
generally
is
thus
favourably
situated
i
can
not
say
that
the
nation
is
prosperous
it
seems
to
be
god
will
that
countries
should
not
really
prosper
man
energy
is
brought
to
its
highest
point
by
the
presence
of
obstacles
to
be
overcome
by
the
existence
of
difficulties
which
are
all
but
insuperable
and
therefore
a
scotch
farm
will
give
a
greater
value
in
produce
than
an
equal
amount
of
land
in
costa
rica
when
nature
does
so
much
man
will
do
next
to
nothing
those
who
seem
to
do
best
in
this
country
both
in
trade
and
agriculture
are
germans
most
of
those
who
are
carrying
on
business
on
a
large
scale
are
foreigners
that
is
not
spanish
by
descent
there
are
english
here
and
americans
and
french
but
i
think
the
germans
are
the
most
wedded
to
the
country
the
finest
coffee
properties
are
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
as
also
are
the
plantations
of
canes
and
for
the
preparation
of
timber
but
they
have
a
very
uphill
task
labour
is
extremely
scarce
and
very
dear
the
people
are
not
idle
as
the
negroes
are
and
they
love
to
earn
and
put
by
money
but
they
are
very
few
in
number
they
have
land
of
their
own
and
are
materially
well
off
in
the
neighbourhood
of
san
josé
a
man
labour
is
worth
a
dollar
a
day
and
even
at
that
price
it
is
not
always
to
be
had
it
seems
to
be
the
fact
that
in
all
countries
in
which
slavery
has
existed
and
has
been
abolished
this
subject
of
labour
offers
the
great
difficulty
in
the
way
of
improvement
labour
becomes
unpopular
and
is
regarded
as
being
in
some
sort
degrading
men
will
not
reconcile
it
with
their
idea
of
freedom
they
wish
to
work
on
their
own
land
if
they
work
at
all
and
to
be
their
own
masters
to
grow
their
own
crops
be
they
ever
so
small
and
to
sit
beneath
their
own
vine
be
the
shade
ever
so
limited
there
are
those
who
will
delight
to
think
that
such
has
been
the
effect
of
emancipation
who
will
argue
and
they
have
strong
arguments
on
their
side
that
will
with
reference
to
his
creatures
is
best
carried
out
by
such
an
order
of
things
i
can
only
say
that
the
material
result
has
not
hitherto
been
good
as
far
as
we
at
present
see
the
struggle
has
produced
idleness
and
sensuality
rather
than
prosperity
and
civilization
it
is
hardly
fair
to
preach
this
doctrine
especially
with
regard
to
costa
rica
for
the
people
are
not
idle
that
at
least
is
not
specially
their
character
they
are
a
humdrum
contented
quiet
orderly
race
of
men
fond
of
money
but
by
no
means
fond
of
risking
it
living
well
as
regards
sufficiency
of
food
and
raiment
but
still
living
very
close
anxious
to
effect
small
savings
and
politically
contented
if
the
security
of
those
savings
can
be
insured
to
them
they
seem
to
be
little
desirous
even
among
the
upper
classes
or
what
we
would
call
the
tradespeople
of
education
either
religious
or
profane
they
have
no
enthusiasm
no
ardent
desires
no
aspirations
if
only
they
could
be
allowed
to
sell
their
dulce
to
the
maker
of
aguardiente
if
they
might
be
permitted
to
get
their
little
profit
out
of
the
manufacture
of
gin
that
at
present
is
the
one
grievance
that
affects
them
but
even
that
they
bear
easily
it
will
perhaps
be
considered
my
duty
to
express
an
opinion
whether
or
no
they
are
an
honest
people
in
one
respect
certainly
they
steal
nothing
at
any
rate
make
no
great
thefts
no
one
is
attacked
on
the
roads
no
life
is
in
danger
from
violence
houses
are
not
broken
open
nay
a
traveller
purse
left
upon
a
table
is
i
believe
safe
nor
will
his
open
portmanteau
be
rifled
but
when
you
come
to
deal
with
them
the
matter
is
different
then
their
conscience
becomes
elastic
and
as
the
trial
is
a
fair
one
between
man
and
man
they
will
do
their
best
to
cheat
you
if
they
lie
to
you
can
not
you
lie
to
them
and
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
you
do
do
so
if
they
by
the
aid
of
law
can
get
to
the
windy
side
of
you
is
not
that
merely
their
success
in
opposition
to
your
attempt
for
of
course
you
do
attempt
to
get
to
the
windy
side
of
them
and
then
bribes
are
in
great
vogue
justice
is
generally
to
be
bought
and
when
that
is
in
the
market
trade
in
other
respects
is
not
generally
conducted
in
the
most
honest
manner
thus
on
the
whole
i
can
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
they
are
altogether
an
honest
people
but
they
have
that
kind
of
honesty
which
is
most
essential
to
the
man
who
travels
in
a
wild
country
they
do
not
knock
out
the
traveller
brains
or
cut
his
throat
for
the
sake
of
what
he
has
in
his
pocket
generally
speaking
the
inhabitants
of
costa
rica
are
of
course
spanish
by
descent
but
here
as
in
all
these
countries
the
blood
is
very
much
mixed
pure
spanish
blood
is
now
i
take
it
quite
an
exception
this
is
seen
more
in
the
physiognomy
than
in
the
colour
and
is
specially
to
be
noticed
in
the
hair
there
is
a
mixture
of
three
races
the
spanish
the
native
indian
and
the
negro
but
the
traces
of
the
latter
are
comparatively
light
and
few
negroes
men
and
women
absolutely
black
and
of
african
birth
or
descent
are
very
rare
and
though
traces
of
the
thick
lip
and
the
woolly
hair
are
to
be
seen
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
and
they
do
not
by
any
means
form
a
staple
of
the
existing
race
the
mixture
is
of
spanish
and
of
indian
blood
in
which
the
spanish
no
doubt
much
preponderates
the
general
colour
is
that
of
a
white
man
but
of
one
who
is
very
swarthy
occasionally
this
becomes
so
marked
that
the
observer
at
once
pronounces
the
man
or
woman
to
be
coloured
but
it
is
the
colouring
of
the
indian
and
not
of
the
negro
the
hue
is
rich
and
to
a
certain
extent
bright
and
the
lines
of
the
face
are
not
flattened
and
blunted
the
hair
also
is
altogether
human
and
in
no
wise
sheepish
i
do
not
think
that
the
inhabitants
of
costa
rica
have
much
to
boast
of
in
the
way
of
personal
beauty
indeed
the
descendant
of
the
spaniard
out
of
his
own
country
seems
to
lose
both
the
manly
dignity
and
the
female
grace
for
which
old
spain
is
still
so
noted
some
pretty
girls
i
did
see
but
they
could
boast
only
the
ordinary
prettiness
which
is
common
to
all
young
girls
and
which
our
friends
in
france
describe
as
being
the
special
gift
of
the
devil
i
saw
no
fine
flaming
flashing
eyes
no
brilliant
figures
such
as
one
sees
in
seville
around
the
in
the
churches
no
profiles
opening
upon
me
struck
me
with
mute
astonishment
the
women
were
humdrum
in
their
appearance
as
the
men
are
in
their
pursuits
they
are
addicted
to
crinoline
as
is
the
nature
of
women
in
these
ages
but
so
long
as
their
petticoats
stuck
out
that
seemed
to
be
everything
in
the
churches
they
squat
down
on
the
ground
in
lieu
of
kneeling
with
their
dresses
and
petticoats
arranged
around
them
looking
like
huge
turnips
with
cropped
heads
like
turnips
that
by
their
persevering
growth
had
got
half
their
roots
above
the
ground
now
women
looking
like
turnips
are
not
specially
attractive
i
was
at
san
josé
during
passion
week
and
had
therefore
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
processions
which
are
customary
in
roman
catholic
countries
at
that
period
i
certainly
should
not
say
that
the
costa
ricans
are
especially
a
religious
people
they
are
humdrum
in
this
as
in
other
respects
and
have
no
enthusiasm
either
for
or
against
the
priesthood
is
not
the
national
sin
nor
is
fanaticism
they
are
all
roman
catholics
most
probably
without
an
exception
their
fathers
and
mothers
were
so
before
them
and
it
is
a
thing
of
course
there
used
to
be
a
bishop
of
costa
rica
indeed
they
never
were
without
one
till
the
other
day
but
not
long
since
the
father
of
their
church
in
some
manner
displeased
the
president
he
had
i
believe
taken
it
into
his
sacred
head
that
he
as
bishop
might
make
a
second
party
in
the
state
and
organize
an
opposition
to
the
existing
government
whereupon
the
president
banished
him
as
the
president
can
do
to
any
one
by
his
mere
word
and
since
that
time
there
has
been
no
bishop
and
will
they
not
get
another
i
asked
no
probably
not
they
do
want
one
it
will
be
so
much
money
saved
looking
at
the
matter
in
this
light
there
is
often
much
to
be
said
for
the
expediency
of
reducing
one
establishment
and
who
manages
the
church
it
does
not
require
much
management
it
goes
on
in
the
old
way
when
they
want
priests
they
get
them
from
guatemala
if
we
could
save
all
our
bishoping
and
get
our
priests
as
we
want
them
from
guatemala
or
any
other
factory
how
excellent
would
be
the
economy
the
cathedral
of
san
josé
is
a
long
low
building
with
side
aisles
formed
by
very
wooden
pillars
in
substance
they
are
hardly
more
than
poles
running
from
the
ground
to
the
roof
the
building
itself
is
mean
enough
but
the
internal
decorations
are
not
badly
arranged
and
the
general
appearance
is
neat
orderly
and
cool
we
all
know
the
usual
manner
in
which
wooden
and
waxen
virgins
are
dressed
and
ornamented
in
such
churches
there
is
as
much
of
this
here
as
elsewhere
but
i
have
seen
it
done
in
worse
taste
both
in
france
and
italy
the
façade
of
the
church
fronting
the
pláza
is
hardly
to
be
called
a
portion
of
the
church
but
is
an
adjunct
to
it
or
rather
the
church
has
been
fixed
on
to
the
façade
which
is
not
without
some
architectural
pretension
in
new
granada
columbia
that
was
the
cathedrals
are
arranged
as
they
are
in
old
spain
the
choir
is
not
situated
round
the
altar
or
immediately
in
front
of
it
as
is
the
custom
in
christian
churches
in
i
believe
all
other
countries
but
is
erected
far
down
the
centre
aisle
near
the
western
entrance
this
however
was
not
the
case
in
any
church
that
i
saw
in
costa
rica
during
the
whole
of
passion
week
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
religious
activity
in
the
way
of
preaching
and
processions
which
reached
its
acme
on
good
friday
on
that
day
the
whole
town
was
processioning
from
morning
which
means
four
till
evening
which
means
two
hours
after
sunset
they
had
three
figures
or
rather
three
characters
for
two
of
them
appeared
in
more
than
one
guise
and
form
each
larger
than
life
those
namely
of
our
saviour
the
virgin
and
john
these
figures
are
made
of
wax
and
the
faces
of
some
of
them
were
excellently
moulded
these
are
manufactured
in
guatemala
as
the
priests
are
and
the
people
there
pride
themselves
on
their
manufacture
not
without
reason
the
figures
of
our
saviour
and
the
virgin
were
in
different
dresses
and
attitudes
according
to
the
period
of
the
day
which
it
was
intended
to
represent
but
the
john
was
always
represented
in
the
dress
of
a
bishop
of
the
present
age
the
figures
were
supported
on
men
shoulders
and
were
carried
backwards
and
forwards
through
every
portion
of
the
town
till
at
last
having
been
brought
forth
in
the
morning
from
the
cathedral
they
were
allowed
at
night
to
rest
in
a
rival
and
certainly
better
built
though
smaller
church
i
must
notice
one
particularity
in
the
population
of
this
country
the
women
occupy
the
nave
and
centre
aisle
squatting
on
the
ground
and
looking
as
i
have
said
like
turnips
whereas
the
men
never
advance
beyond
the
side
aisles
the
women
of
the
higher
classes
all
those
indeed
who
make
any
pretence
to
dress
and
finery
bring
with
them
little
bits
of
carpet
on
which
they
squat
but
there
are
none
of
those
chairs
with
which
churches
on
the
continent
are
so
commonly
filled
it
seemed
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
called
society
among
the
people
of
san
josé
they
do
not
go
out
to
each
other
homes
nor
meet
in
public
they
have
neither
nor
nor
nor
i
was
even
assured
though
i
can
not
say
that
the
assurance
reached
my
belief
that
they
never
flirt
occasionally
on
sundays
for
instance
and
on
holidays
they
put
on
their
best
clothes
and
call
on
each
other
but
even
then
there
is
no
conversation
among
them
they
sit
stiffly
on
each
sofas
and
make
remarks
at
intervals
like
minute
guns
about
the
weather
but
what
they
do
i
asked
the
men
scrape
money
together
and
when
they
have
enough
they
build
a
house
big
or
little
according
to
the
amount
that
they
have
scraped
that
satisfies
the
ambition
of
a
costa
rican
when
he
wishes
to
amuse
himself
he
goes
to
a
and
the
women
they
get
married
early
if
their
fathers
can
give
them
a
few
ounces
the
ounce
is
the
old
doubloon
worth
here
about
three
pounds
eight
shillings
sterling
and
then
they
cook
and
have
children
and
if
the
ounces
be
wanting
and
they
do
get
married
then
they
cook
all
the
same
but
do
not
have
the
children
as
a
general
rule
and
so
people
vegetate
in
costa
rica
and
now
i
must
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
form
of
government
in
this
country
it
is
a
republic
of
course
arranged
on
the
model
plan
a
president
is
elected
for
a
term
of
years
in
this
case
six
he
has
ministers
who
assist
him
in
his
government
and
whom
he
appoints
and
there
is
a
house
of
congress
elected
of
course
by
the
people
who
make
the
laws
the
president
merely
carries
them
out
and
so
utopia
is
realized
utopia
might
perhaps
be
realized
in
such
republics
or
at
any
rate
the
realization
might
not
be
so
very
distant
as
it
is
at
present
were
it
not
that
in
all
of
them
the
practice
by
some
accident
runs
so
far
away
from
the
theory
in
costa
rica
don
juan
rafael
mora
familiarly
called
juanito
is
now
the
president
having
been
not
long
since
for
the
third
time
we
read
in
the
on
tuesday
morning
that
the
election
had
been
carried
on
saturday
and
that
was
all
we
knew
about
it
it
is
thus
they
elect
a
president
in
costa
rica
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
or
troubles
his
head
with
the
matter
if
any
one
suggested
a
rival
president
he
would
be
banished
but
such
a
thing
is
not
thought
of
no
note
is
taken
as
to
five
years
or
six
years
at
some
period
that
pleases
him
the
president
says
that
he
has
been
and
he
is
who
cares
why
not
juanito
as
well
as
any
one
else
only
it
is
a
pity
he
will
not
let
us
sell
our
dulce
to
the
distillers
the
president
salary
is
three
thousand
dollars
a
year
an
income
which
for
so
high
a
position
is
moderate
enough
but
then
a
further
sum
of
six
thousand
dollars
is
added
to
this
for
official
entertainment
the
official
entertainments
however
are
not
numerous
i
was
informed
that
he
usually
gives
one
party
every
year
he
himself
still
lives
in
his
private
house
and
still
keeps
a
shop
as
he
did
before
he
was
president
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
is
no
aristocracy
in
this
country
above
the
aristocracy
of
the
shopkeepers
as
far
as
i
could
learn
the
congress
is
altogether
a
farce
there
is
a
congress
or
collection
of
men
sent
up
from
different
parts
of
the
country
some
ten
or
dozen
of
whom
sit
occasionally
round
a
table
in
the
great
hall
but
they
neither
debate
vote
nor
offer
opinions
some
one
man
duly
instructed
by
the
president
lets
them
know
what
law
is
to
be
made
or
altered
and
the
law
is
made
or
altered
should
any
member
of
congress
make
himself
disagreeable
he
would
as
a
matter
of
course
be
banished
taken
that
is
to
and
there
told
to
shift
for
himself
now
this
enforced
journey
to
does
not
seem
to
be
more
popular
among
the
costa
ricans
than
a
journey
to
siberia
is
among
the
russians
such
is
the
model
republic
of
central
america
admitted
i
am
told
to
be
the
best
administered
of
the
cluster
of
republics
there
established
this
at
any
rate
may
certainly
be
said
for
it
that
life
and
property
are
safe
they
are
safe
for
the
present
and
will
probably
remain
so
unless
the
filibusters
make
their
way
into
the
neighbouring
state
of
nicaragua
in
greater
numbers
and
with
better
leaders
than
they
have
hitherto
had
and
it
must
be
told
to
the
credit
of
the
costa
ricans
that
it
was
by
them
and
their
efforts
that
the
invasion
of
walker
and
the
filibusters
into
central
america
was
stopped
and
repelled
these
enterprising
gentlemen
the
filibusters
landed
on
the
coast
of
nicaragua
having
come
down
from
california
here
they
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
a
large
portion
of
the
country
that
portion
being
the
most
thickly
populated
and
the
richest
many
of
the
towns
they
utterly
destroyed
and
among
them
granada
the
capital
it
seems
that
at
this
time
the
whole
state
of
nicaragua
was
paralyzed
and
unable
to
strike
any
blow
in
its
own
defence
having
laid
waste
the
upper
or
more
northern
country
walker
came
down
south
as
far
as
rivas
a
town
still
in
nicaragua
but
not
far
removed
from
the
borders
of
costa
rica
his
intention
doubtless
was
to
take
possession
of
costa
rica
so
that
he
might
command
the
whole
transit
across
the
isthmus
but
at
rivas
he
was
attacked
by
the
soldiery
of
costa
rica
under
the
command
of
a
brother
of
don
juan
mora
this
was
in
and
it
seems
that
some
three
thousand
costa
ricans
were
taken
as
far
as
rivas
but
few
of
them
returned
they
were
attacked
by
cholera
and
what
with
that
and
want
and
the
intense
heat
to
which
of
course
must
be
added
what
injuries
the
filibusters
could
do
them
they
were
destroyed
and
a
remnant
only
returned
but
in
the
different
states
of
central
america
joined
themselves
in
a
league
with
the
object
of
expelling
these
filibusters
i
do
not
know
that
either
of
the
three
northern
states
sent
any
men
to
rivas
and
the
weight
of
the
struggle
again
fell
upon
costa
rica
the
costa
ricans
and
nicaraguans
together
invested
rivas
in
which
five
hundred
filibusters
under
walker
for
some
time
maintained
themselves
these
men
were
reduced
to
great
straits
and
might
no
doubt
have
been
taken
bodily
but
the
central
americans
also
had
their
difficulties
to
contend
with
they
did
not
agree
very
well
together
and
they
had
but
slender
means
of
supporting
themselves
it
ended
in
a
capitulation
under
which
walker
and
his
associates
were
to
walk
out
with
their
arms
and
all
the
honours
of
war
and
by
which
moreover
it
was
stipulated
that
the
five
hundred
were
to
be
sent
back
to
america
at
the
expense
of
the
central
american
states
the
states
thinking
no
doubt
that
it
was
good
economy
to
build
a
golden
bridge
for
a
flying
enemy
did
so
send
them
back
and
in
this
manner
for
a
while
central
america
was
freed
from
the
locusts
such
was
the
capitulation
of
rivas
a
subject
on
which
all
costa
ricans
now
take
much
pride
to
themselves
and
indeed
honour
is
due
to
them
in
this
matter
for
they
evinced
a
spirit
in
the
business
when
their
neighbours
of
nicaragua
failed
to
do
so
they
soon
determined
that
the
filibusters
would
do
them
no
good
could
indeed
by
no
possibility
do
them
anything
but
harm
consequently
they
resolved
to
have
the
first
blow
and
they
struck
it
manfully
though
not
so
successfully
as
might
have
been
wished
the
total
population
of
central
america
is
i
believe
about
two
millions
while
that
of
costa
rica
does
not
exceed
two
hundred
thousand
of
the
five
states
guatemala
has
by
far
the
largest
number
of
inhabitants
and
indeed
the
town
of
guatemala
may
still
be
regarded
as
the
capital
of
all
the
isthmus
territories
they
fabricate
there
not
only
priests
and
wax
images
but
doctors
and
lawyers
and
all
those
expensive
luxuries
for
the
production
of
which
the
air
of
a
capital
is
generally
considered
necessary
the
president
of
guatemala
is
they
say
an
indian
nearly
of
pure
descent
his
name
is
carrera
i
have
spoken
of
the
army
of
costa
rica
in
point
of
accoutrement
and
outward
show
they
are
on
ordinary
days
somewhat
like
the
troops
that
were
not
fit
to
march
through
coventry
they
wear
no
regimentals
and
are
only
to
be
known
when
on
duty
by
a
very
gun
on
sundays
however
and
holidays
they
do
wear
a
sort
of
uniform
consisting
of
a
neat
cap
and
a
little
braiding
upon
their
best
clothes
this
dress
such
as
it
is
they
are
obliged
to
find
for
themselves
the
clothing
department
therefore
is
not
troublesome
these
men
are
enrolled
after
the
manner
of
our
militia
the
full
number
should
be
nine
thousand
and
is
generally
somewhat
above
six
thousand
of
this
number
five
hundred
are
kept
in
barracks
the
men
taking
it
by
turns
month
by
month
when
in
barracks
they
receive
about
one
shilling
and
sixpence
a
day
at
other
times
they
have
no
pay
i
can
not
close
my
notice
of
san
josé
without
speaking
somewhat
more
specially
of
the
range
of
public
buildings
i
am
told
that
it
was
built
by
a
german
or
rather
by
two
germans
the
basement
and
the
upper
story
being
the
work
of
different
persons
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
a
handsome
building
and
would
not
disgrace
any
european
capital
there
is
in
it
a
in
england
at
least
we
should
call
it
a
throne
on
this
the
president
sits
when
he
receives
ambassadors
from
foreign
countries
the
velvet
and
gilding
were
quite
unexceptionable
and
the
whole
is
very
imposing
the
sitting
of
congress
is
held
in
the
same
chamber
but
that
as
i
have
explained
is
not
imposing
the
chief
produce
of
costa
rica
is
coffee
those
who
love
statistics
may
perhaps
care
to
know
that
the
average
yearly
export
is
something
under
a
hundred
thousand
quintals
now
a
quintal
weighs
a
hundred
pounds
or
rather
i
believe
pounds

chapter

central
america
costa
rica
mount
irazu
in
the
neighbourhood
of
san
josé
there
is
a
volcanic
mountain
the
name
of
which
is
irazu
i
was
informed
that
it
still
smoked
though
it
had
discontinued
for
the
present
the
ejection
of
flames
and
lava
indeed
the
whole
country
is
full
of
such
mountains
there
is
one
the
monte
blanco
the
summit
of
which
has
never
yet
been
reached
so
rumour
says
in
costa
rica
far
distant
enveloped
among
other
mountains
and
to
be
reached
only
through
dense
aboriginal
forests
which
still
emits
and
is
always
emitting
fire
and
burning
floods
of
molten
stones
different
excursions
have
been
made
with
the
object
of
ascending
the
monte
blanco
but
hitherto
in
vain
not
long
since
it
was
attempted
by
a
french
baron
but
he
and
his
guide
were
for
twenty
days
in
the
woods
and
then
returned
their
provisions
failing
them
you
should
ascend
the
monte
blanco
said
sir
william
ouseley
to
me
you
are
a
man
at
large
with
nothing
to
do
it
is
just
the
work
for
you
this
was
sir
william
satire
on
the
lightness
of
my
ordinary
occupations
light
as
they
might
be
however
i
had
neither
time
nor
courage
for
an
undertaking
such
as
that
so
i
determined
to
satisfy
myself
with
the
irazu
it
happened
rather
unfortunately
for
me
that
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
at
san
josé
a
large
party
consisting
of
sir
family
and
others
were
in
the
very
act
of
visiting
the
mountain
those
therefore
who
were
anxious
to
see
the
sight
and
willing
to
undergo
the
labour
thus
had
their
opportunity
and
it
became
impossible
for
me
to
make
up
a
second
party
one
hope
i
had
the
secretary
of
legation
had
not
gone
official
occupation
joined
to
a
dislike
of
mud
and
rough
stones
had
kept
him
at
home
perhaps
i
might
prevail
the
intensity
of
that
work
might
give
way
before
a
week
unremitting
labour
and
that
sybarite
propensity
might
be
overcome
but
all
my
eloquence
was
of
no
avail
an
absence
of
a
day
and
a
half
only
was
required
and
three
were
spent
in
proving
that
this
could
not
be
effected
the
stones
and
mud
too
were
becoming
worse
and
worse
for
the
rainy
season
had
commenced
in
fact
the
secretary
of
legation
would
not
budge
le
jeu
ne
vaut
pas
la
chandelle
said
the
secretary
of
legation
whereupon
he
lighted
another
cigar
and
took
a
turn
in
the
grass
hammock
now
in
my
mind
it
must
be
a
very
bad
game
indeed
that
is
not
worth
the
candle
and
almost
any
game
is
better
than
no
game
at
all
i
was
thus
in
deep
trouble
making
up
my
mind
to
go
alone
or
rather
alone
with
my
guide
for
the
due
appreciation
of
which
state
of
loneliness
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
as
i
do
not
speak
a
word
of
spanish
i
should
have
no
possible
means
of
communication
with
the
guide
when
a
low
and
mild
voice
fell
upon
my
ear
offering
me
its
proprietor
as
my
companion
i
went
up
with
sir
william
last
week
said
the
mild
voice
and
if
you
will
permit
me
i
shall
be
happy
to
go
with
you
i
should
like
to
see
it
twice
and
i
live
at
cartago
on
the
way
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
was
sacrificing
himself
and
offering
to
repeat
this
troublesome
journey
merely
out
of
good
nature
but
the
service
which
he
proposed
to
render
me
was
too
essential
and
i
could
not
afford
to
reject
the
offer
he
lived
in
the
country
and
spoke
spanish
and
was
moreover
a
mild
little
gentleman
very
suitable
as
a
companion
and
not
given
too
pertinaciously
to
a
will
of
his
own
now
the
secretary
of
legation
would
have
driven
me
mad
half
a
score
of
times
during
the
journey
he
would
have
deafened
me
with
politics
and
with
such
politics
too
so
that
on
the
whole
i
knew
myself
to
be
well
off
with
the
mild
voice
you
must
go
through
cartago
said
the
mild
voice
and
i
live
there
we
will
dine
there
at
the
inn
and
then
do
a
portion
of
our
work
the
same
evening
it
was
so
arranged
i
was
to
be
with
him
the
next
day
at
three
with
a
guide
and
two
mules
on
the
next
morning
it
rained
provokingly
i
ought
to
have
started
at
twelve
but
at
that
time
it
was
pouring
and
neither
the
guide
nor
the
mules
showed
themselves
you
will
never
get
there
said
the
secretary
of
legation
looking
up
to
the
murky
clouds
with
a
gleam
of
delight
the
game
is
never
worth
such
a
candle
as
that
i
shall
get
there
most
assuredly
said
i
rather
sulkily
let
the
candle
cost
what
it
may
but
still
the
mules
did
not
come
men
have
no
idea
of
time
in
any
country
that
is
or
has
been
connected
with
spain
yes
señor
you
said
twelve
and
it
is
now
only
two
well
three
the
day
is
long
señor
there
is
plenty
of
time
vaminos
since
you
are
in
such
a
hurry
shall
we
make
a
start
of
it
at
two
so
spoke
not
my
guide
for
as
will
be
seen
he
never
spoke
at
all
but
my
guide
owner
who
came
accompanying
the
mules
in
huge
hurry
with
sundry
mute
exclamations
uttered
by
my
countenance
since
my
tongue
was
unintelligible
and
with
appeals
to
my
watch
which
should
have
broken
the
man
heart
as
i
thrust
it
into
his
face
i
clomb
into
my
saddle
and
then
a
shoeless
creature
with
a
small
straw
hat
tied
on
to
his
head
by
a
handkerchief
with
difficulty
poised
himself
on
the
other
beast
vamos
i
exclaimed
and
trotted
down
the
street
for
i
knew
that
in
that
direction
lay
the
road
to
cartago
god
be
with
you
said
the
secretary
of
legation
the
rainy
season
has
set
in
permanently
i
know
but
perhaps
you
may
have
half
an
hour
of
sunshine
now
and
again
i
hope
you
will
enjoy
yourself
it
was
not
raining
when
i
started
and
in
fact
did
not
rain
again
the
whole
afternoon
i
trotted
valiantly
down
the
street
knowing
my
way
so
far
but
at
the
bottom
of
the
town
the
roads
divided
and
i
waited
for
my
guide
go
on
first
said
i
pointing
along
the
road
but
he
did
not
understand
me
and
stood
still
go
on
said
i
getting
behind
his
mule
as
though
to
drive
him
but
he
merely
stared
and
shuffled
himself
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
cartago
i
shouted
meaning
that
he
was
to
show
me
the
way
there
si
señor
he
replied
and
backed
himself
into
the
ditch
out
of
my
way
he
was
certainly
the
stupidest
man
i
ever
met
in
my
life
and
i
believe
the
secretary
of
legation
had
selected
him
on
purpose
i
was
obliged
to
choose
my
own
road
out
of
two
and
luckily
chose
the
right
one
had
i
gone
wrong
i
doubt
whether
the
man
would
have
had
wit
enough
to
put
me
right
i
again
trotted
on
but
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
obliged
to
wait
for
my
attendant
was
behind
me
out
of
sight
and
i
felt
myself
bound
to
look
after
my
traps
which
were
fastened
to
his
mule
come
on
i
shouted
in
good
broad
english
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
why
the
mischief
do
you
come
on
and
my
voice
was
so
pitched
that
on
this
occasion
i
think
he
did
understand
something
of
what
i
meant
along
i
repeated
as
he
gently
drew
up
to
me
and
i
hit
his
mule
sharply
on
the
crupper
with
my
stick
spur
him
i
said
and
i
explained
what
i
meant
by
sticking
my
own
rowels
into
my
own
beast
whereupon
the
guide
showed
me
that
he
had
no
spurs
now
if
there
be
one
rule
of
life
more
strictly
kept
in
costa
rica
than
another
it
is
this
that
no
man
ever
mounts
horse
or
mule
without
spurs
a
man
in
england
would
as
soon
think
of
hunting
without
breeches
no
muleteer
was
ever
seen
without
them
and
when
a
mule
is
hired
if
the
hirer
have
no
saddle
he
may
chance
to
have
to
ride
without
one
but
if
he
have
no
spurs
he
will
always
be
supplied
i
took
off
one
of
my
own
which
i
had
borrowed
out
of
the
secretary
of
legation
establishment
and
offered
it
to
the
man
remembering
the
doctrine
of
hudibras
he
then
showed
me
that
one
of
his
hands
was
tied
up
and
that
he
could
not
put
the
spur
on
consequently
i
was
driven
to
dismount
myself
and
to
act
equerry
to
this
knight
thrice
on
the
road
i
had
to
do
so
for
twice
the
spur
slipped
from
off
his
naked
foot
even
with
this
i
could
not
bring
him
on
it
is
four
leagues
or
about
sixteen
miles
from
san
josé
to
cartago
and
with
all
my
hastening
we
were
three
hours
on
the
road
the
way
lay
through
a
rich
and
country
the
whole
of
this
is
now
called
the
valley
of
san
josé
and
consists
in
truth
of
a
broad
plateau
diversified
by
moderate
hills
and
valleys
but
all
being
at
a
considerable
height
that
is
from
three
to
four
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
the
road
also
is
fairly
good
so
good
that
a
species
of
omnibus
runs
on
it
daily
there
being
some
considerable
traffic
between
the
places
for
cartago
is
the
second
town
in
the
republic
cartago
is
now
the
second
town
but
not
long
since
it
was
the
capital
it
was
however
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
and
though
it
has
been
rebuilt
it
has
never
again
taken
its
former
position
its
present
population
is
said
to
be
ten
thousand
but
this
includes
not
only
the
suburbs
but
the
adjacent
villages
the
town
covers
a
large
tract
of
ground
which
is
divided
into
long
broad
parallel
streets
with
a
large
pláza
in
the
middle
as
though
it
had
been
expected
that
a
fine
utopian
city
would
have
sprung
up
alas
there
is
nothing
fine
about
it
and
very
little
that
is
utopian
lingering
near
the
hotel
door
almost
now
in
a
state
of
despair
i
met
him
of
the
mild
voice
yes
he
had
been
waiting
for
three
hours
certainly
he
mildly
said
as
i
spurred
my
beast
up
to
the
door
now
that
i
was
come
it
was
all
right
and
on
the
whole
he
rather
liked
waiting
that
is
when
it
did
not
result
in
waiting
for
nothing
and
then
we
sat
down
to
dinner
at
the
cartago
hotel
this
also
was
kept
by
a
german
who
after
a
little
hesitation
confessed
that
he
had
come
to
the
country
as
a
filibuster
you
have
fallen
on
your
legs
pretty
well
said
i
for
he
had
a
comfortable
house
and
gave
us
a
decent
dinner
yes
said
he
rather
dubiously
but
when
i
came
to
costa
rica
i
intended
to
do
better
than
this
he
might
however
remember
that
not
one
in
five
hundred
of
them
had
done
so
well
and
then
another
guide
had
to
be
found
for
it
was
clear
that
the
one
i
had
brought
with
me
was
useless
and
i
had
a
visit
to
make
for
my
friend
lived
with
a
widow
lady
who
would
be
grieved
he
said
if
i
passed
through
without
seeing
her
so
i
did
call
on
her
i
saw
her
again
on
my
return
through
cartago
as
i
shall
specify
with
all
these
delays
it
was
dark
when
we
started
our
plan
was
to
ride
up
to
an
upland
pasture
farm
at
which
visitors
to
the
mountain
generally
stop
to
sleep
there
for
a
few
hours
and
then
to
start
between
three
and
four
so
as
to
reach
the
top
of
the
mountain
by
sunrise
now
i
perfectly
well
remember
what
i
said
with
reference
to
sunrises
from
on
the
occasion
of
that
disastrous
visit
to
the
blue
mountain
peak
in
jamaica
how
i
then
swore
that
i
would
never
do
another
mountain
sunrise
having
always
failed
lamentably
in
such
attempts
i
remember
and
did
remember
this
and
as
far
as
the
sunrise
was
concerned
would
certainly
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
irazu
at
five
but
the
volcano
and
the
crater
made
the
matter
very
different
they
were
my
attractions
and
as
the
mild
voice
suggested
an
early
hour
it
would
not
have
become
me
to
have
hesitated
start
at
four
certainly
i
said
the
beds
at
the
potrero
such
was
the
name
they
gave
the
place
at
which
we
stopped
will
not
be
soft
enough
to
keep
us
sleeping
no
said
the
mild
voice
they
are
not
soft
and
so
we
proceeded
our
road
was
very
rough
and
very
steep
and
the
night
was
very
dark
it
was
rough
at
first
and
then
it
became
slippery
which
was
worse
i
had
no
idea
that
earth
could
be
so
slippery
my
mule
which
was
a
very
fine
one
fell
under
me
repeatedly
being
altogether
unable
to
keep
her
footing
on
these
occasions
she
usually
scrambled
up
with
me
still
on
her
back
once
however
near
the
beginning
of
my
difficulties
i
thought
to
relieve
her
and
to
do
so
i
got
off
her
i
soon
found
my
mistake
i
immediately
slipped
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
found
it
impossible
to
stand
on
my
feet
i
did
not
sink
into
the
mud
but
slipped
off
it
down
down
down
as
if
i
were
going
back
to
cartago
all
alone
in
the
dark
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
again
mounted
my
beast
but
when
there
there
i
remained
let
her
fall
as
she
would
at
eleven
we
reached
the
potrero
the
house
here
was
little
more
than
a
rancho
or
hut
one
of
those
log
farm
buildings
which
settlers
make
when
they
first
clear
the
timber
from
a
part
of
their
selected
lots
intending
to
replace
them
in
a
year
or
two
by
such
tidy
little
houses
but
so
rarely
fulfilling
their
intentions
all
through
costa
rica
such
ranchos
are
common
on
the
coffee
plantations
and
in
the
more
part
of
the
country
round
the
towns
for
instance
and
along
the
road
to
the
farmers
have
a
better
class
of
residence
they
inhabit
long
houses
with
tiled
roofs
and
a
ground
floor
only
not
at
all
unlike
farmers
houses
in
ireland
only
that
there
they
are
thatched
or
slated
away
from
such
patches
of
cultivation
one
seldom
finds
any
house
better
than
a
rancho
but
the
rancho
had
a
door
and
that
door
was
fastened
so
we
knocked
and
hallooed
dito
cried
the
guide
such
being
i
presume
the
familiar
sobriquet
of
his
friend
within
dito
sang
out
my
mild
friend
with
all
his
small
energy
of
voice
dito
shouted
i
and
i
think
that
my
voice
was
the
one
which
wakened
the
sleepers
within
we
were
soon
admitted
into
the
hut
and
found
that
we
were
by
no
means
the
first
comers
as
soon
as
a
candle
was
lighted
we
saw
that
there
were
four
bedsteads
in
the
room
and
that
two
of
them
were
occupied
there
were
however
two
left
for
my
friend
and
myself
and
it
appeared
also
that
the
occupiers
were
friends
of
my
friend
they
were
german
savants
one
by
profession
an
architect
and
the
other
a
doctor
who
had
come
up
into
the
woods
looking
for
birds
beasts
and
botanical
treasures
and
had
already
been
there
some
three
or
four
days
they
were
amply
supplied
with
provisions
and
immediately
offered
us
supper
the
architect
sat
up
in
bed
to
welcome
us
and
the
doctor
got
up
to
clear
the
two
spare
beds
of
his
trappings
there
is
a
luck
in
these
things
i
remember
once
clambering
to
the
top
of
in
cumberland
if
it
chance
to
be
in
westmoreland
i
beg
the
county
pardon
i
expected
nothing
more
than
men
generally
look
for
on
the
tops
of
mountains
but
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
a
tent
i
ventured
to
look
in
and
there
i
saw
two
officers
of
the
engineers
friends
of
my
own
sharpening
their
knives
preparatory
to
the
dissection
of
a
roast
goose
and
beside
the
goose
stood
a
bottle
of
brandy
now
i
always
looked
on
that
as
a
direct
dispensation
of
providence
walking
down
the
mountain
that
same
evening
to
whitehaven
i
stopped
at
a
small
on
the
side
of
enerdale
and
called
for
some
whisky
and
water
the
article
produced
was
not
good
and
so
i
said
appealing
to
an
elderly
gentleman
in
black
who
sat
by
the
hobside
very
contemplative
ah
said
he
you
ca
get
good
drink
in
these
parts
sir
i
know
that
so
well
that
i
generally
bring
a
bottle
of
my
own
i
immediately
opened
a
warm
conversation
with
that
gentleman
he
was
a
clergyman
of
a
neighbouring
parish
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
magnum
of
port
had
made
its
appearance
out
of
a
neighbouring
cupboard
that
i
thought
was
another
dispensation
of
providence
it
was
odd
that
they
should
have
come
together
but
the
facts
are
as
i
state
them
i
did
venture
on
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
and
a
slight
morsel
of
bread
and
meat
and
then
i
prepared
to
throw
myself
on
the
bed
immediately
opposite
to
the
doctor
as
i
did
so
i
saw
something
move
inside
the
doctor
bed
my
wife
is
there
said
the
doctor
seeing
the
direction
of
my
eyes
oh
said
i
and
i
at
once
became
very
moderate
in
the
slight
change
which
i
made
in
my
toilet
we
were
to
start
at
four
and
at
four
precisely
i
woke
as
my
friend
had
said
there
was
little
to
tempt
me
to
sleep
the
great
drawback
to
the
comfort
of
these
ranchos
is
the
quantity
of
dirt
which
continually
falls
out
of
the
roof
into
one
eyes
then
the
boards
are
hard
of
course
and
of
course
also
they
are
infested
with
vermin
they
tell
you
indeed
of
scorpions
and
centipedes
of
preternatural
wasps
and
musquitos
as
big
as
young
ostriches
but
i
found
none
of
these
beasts
of
prey
of
beasts
of
a
smaller
size
i
did
find
more
than
plenty
at
four
i
was
up
but
my
friend
was
very
unwilling
to
stir
it
was
long
before
i
could
induce
the
mild
voice
to
make
itself
heard
in
any
way
at
that
time
it
was
fine
but
it
was
long
before
i
could
get
the
muleteer
when
i
had
done
so
and
he
had
thrown
their
grass
to
the
beasts
it
began
to
rain
of
course
it
rains
like
the
d
said
i
very
crossly
does
it
said
the
mild
voice
from
the
bed
i
am
so
sorry
and
in
half
a
second
he
was
again
in
the
land
of
dreams
the
doctor
snored
but
from
the
furthest
remote
comer
i
could
see
the
eye
of
the
doctor
wife
looking
out
at
me
it
was
between
six
and
seven
when
we
started
at
that
time
it
was
not
raining
but
the
clouds
looked
as
like
rain
as
the
secretary
of
legation
could
have
desired
and
the
two
germans
were
anything
but
consolatory
in
their
prophecies
you
not
see
a
stick
or
a
stone
said
the
architect
you
better
stop
and
breakfast
with
us
it
is
very
dangerous
to
be
wet
in
the
mountains
very
dangerous
said
the
doctor
it
is
a
bad
morning
certainly
pleaded
the
mild
voice
piteously
the
doctor
wife
said
nothing
but
i
could
see
her
eyes
looking
out
at
the
weather
how
on
earth
was
she
to
get
herself
dressed
it
occurred
to
me
then
if
we
should
postpone
our
journey
and
remain
there
it
ended
in
our
starting
just
two
hours
after
the
prescribed
time
the
road
up
from
the
potrero
is
very
steep
almost
the
whole
way
to
the
summit
but
it
was
not
so
muddy
as
that
we
had
passed
over
on
the
preceding
evening
for
some
little
way
there
were
patches
of
cultivation
the
ground
bearing
sweet
potatoes
and
indian
corn
then
we
came
into
a
tract
of
beautiful
forest
scenery
the
land
though
steep
was
broken
and
only
partially
covered
with
trees
the
grass
in
patches
was
as
good
as
in
an
english
park
and
the
views
through
the
open
bits
of
the
forest
were
very
lovely
in
four
or
five
different
places
we
found
the
ground
sufficiently
open
for
all
the
requirements
of
a
picturesque
country
house
and
no
prettier
site
for
such
a
house
could
well
be
found
this
was
by
far
the
finest
scenery
that
i
had
hitherto
seen
in
costa
rica
but
even
here
there
was
a
want
of
water
in
ascending
the
mountain
we
saw
some
magnificent
forest
trees
generally
of
the
kind
called
in
jamaica
there
were
oaks
also
so
called
there
very
nearly
approaching
our
in
colour
and
foliage
but
much
larger
than
that
tree
is
with
us
they
were
all
more
or
less
covered
with
parasite
plants
and
those
parasites
certainly
add
greatly
to
the
beauty
of
the
supporting
trunk
by
degrees
we
got
into
thick
forest
forest
i
mean
so
thick
that
it
affords
no
views
you
see
and
feel
the
trees
that
are
close
to
you
but
see
nothing
else
and
here
the
path
became
so
steep
that
we
were
obliged
to
dismount
and
let
the
beasts
clamber
up
by
themselves
and
the
mist
became
very
thick
so
much
so
that
we
could
hardly
trace
our
path
and
then
the
guide
said
that
he
thought
he
had
lost
his
way
people
often
do
come
out
and
go
back
again
without
ever
reaching
the
crater
at
all
do
they
said
the
mild
voice
very
often
said
the
guide
but
we
wo
be
such
people
said
i
oh
no
said
the
mild
voice
not
if
we
can
help
it
and
we
will
help
it
allons
andiamos
vamos
the
first
word
which
an
englishman
learns
in
any
language
is
that
which
signifies
a
determination
to
proceed
and
we
did
proceed
turning
now
hither
and
now
thither
groping
about
in
the
mist
till
at
last
the
wood
was
all
left
behind
us
and
we
were
out
among
long
grass
on
a
and
now
said
the
guide
unless
the
mist
clears
i
ca
say
which
way
we
ought
to
go
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
mist
did
clear
itself
away
altogether
from
one
side
of
us
looking
down
to
the
left
we
could
see
far
away
into
the
valleys
beneath
over
large
forests
and
across
a
lower
range
of
hills
till
the
eye
could
reach
the
cultivated
plateau
below
but
on
the
other
side
looking
up
to
a
mountain
higher
still
than
that
on
which
we
stood
all
was
not
only
misty
but
perfectly
dark
and
inscrutable
the
guide
however
now
knew
the
spot
we
were
near
the
summit
of
irazu
and
a
further
ride
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
took
us
there
and
indeed
here
there
was
no
difficulty
in
riding
the
side
of
the
hill
was
covered
with
grass
and
not
over
steep
there
said
the
mild
voice
pointing
to
a
broad
bushy
stumpy
tree
there
is
the
place
where
lady
ouseley
breakfasted
and
he
looked
at
our
modest
havresack
and
we
will
breakfast
there
too
i
answered
but
we
will
go
down
the
crater
first
oh
yes
certainly
said
the
mild
voice
but
perhaps
i
know
i
am
not
sure
i
can
go
exactly
down
into
the
crater
the
crater
of
the
volcano
is
not
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
or
rather
it
is
not
at
what
is
now
the
top
of
the
mountain
so
that
at
first
one
has
to
look
down
upon
it
i
doubt
even
whether
the
volcano
has
ever
effected
the
absolute
summit
i
may
as
well
state
here
that
the
height
of
the
mountain
on
which
we
were
now
standing
is
supposed
to
be
feet
above
the
luckily
for
us
though
the
mist
reached
to
us
where
we
stood
everything
to
the
left
of
us
was
clear
and
we
could
look
down
down
into
the
crater
as
into
a
basin
everything
was
clear
so
that
we
could
count
the
different
orifices
eight
in
number
of
which
two
however
had
almost
run
themselves
into
one
and
see
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
see
how
the
present
formation
of
the
volcano
had
been
brought
about
it
was
as
though
a
very
large
excavation
had
been
made
on
the
side
of
a
hill
commencing
indeed
not
quite
from
the
summit
but
very
near
it
and
leaving
a
vast
hole
not
deep
in
proportion
to
its
surface
sloping
down
the
this
huge
excavation
which
i
take
to
be
the
extent
of
the
crater
for
it
has
evidently
been
all
formed
by
the
irruption
of
volcanic
matter
is
divided
into
two
parts
a
broken
fragment
of
a
mountain
now
lying
between
them
and
the
smaller
of
these
two
has
lost
all
volcanic
appearance
it
is
a
good
deal
covered
with
bush
and
scrubby
forest
trees
and
seems
to
have
no
remaining
connection
with
sulphur
and
brimstone
the
other
part
in
which
the
crater
now
absolutely
in
use
is
situated
is
a
large
hollow
in
the
which
might
perhaps
contain
a
farm
of
six
hundred
acres
not
having
been
able
to
measure
it
i
know
no
other
way
of
describing
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
its
size
but
a
great
portion
of
this
again
has
lost
all
its
volcanic
appendages
except
indeed
that
lumps
of
lava
are
scattered
over
the
whole
of
it
as
they
are
though
more
sparingly
over
the
mountain
beyond
there
is
a
ledge
of
rock
running
round
the
interior
of
this
division
of
the
excavation
down
it
like
a
row
of
seats
in
a
roman
amphitheatre
or
an
excrescence
if
one
can
fancy
such
down
a
teacup
the
ground
above
this
ledge
is
of
course
more
extensive
than
that
below
as
the
hollow
narrows
towards
the
bottom
the
present
working
mouth
of
the
volcanic
and
all
those
that
have
been
working
for
many
a
long
year
the
eight
in
number
of
which
i
have
spoken
lie
at
the
bottom
of
this
lowest
hollow
this
i
should
say
might
contain
a
farm
of
about
two
hundred
acres
such
was
the
form
of
the
land
on
which
we
looked
down
the
descent
from
the
top
to
the
ledge
was
easy
enough
and
was
made
by
myself
and
my
friend
with
considerable
rapidity
i
started
at
a
pace
which
convinced
him
that
i
should
break
my
neck
and
he
followed
gallantly
resolving
to
die
with
me
you
surely
kill
yourself
trollope
you
surely
will
said
the
mild
voice
and
yet
he
never
deserted
me
sir
william
got
as
far
as
this
said
he
when
we
were
on
the
ledge
but
he
got
no
further
we
will
do
better
than
sir
william
said
i
we
will
go
down
into
that
hole
where
we
see
the
sulphur
into
the
very
hole
yes
if
we
get
to
windward
i
think
we
can
get
into
the
very
hole
look
at
the
huge
column
of
white
smoke
how
it
comes
all
in
this
direction
on
the
other
side
of
the
crater
we
should
not
feel
it
the
descent
below
the
ledge
into
my
smaller
farm
was
not
made
so
easily
it
must
be
understood
that
our
guide
was
left
above
with
the
mules
we
should
have
brought
two
men
whereas
we
had
only
brought
one
and
had
therefore
to
perform
our
climbing
unassisted
i
at
first
attempted
it
in
a
direct
line
down
from
where
we
stood
but
i
soon
found
this
to
be
impracticable
and
was
forced
to
reascend
the
earth
was
so
friable
that
it
broke
away
from
me
at
every
motion
that
i
made
and
after
having
gone
down
a
few
feet
i
was
glad
enough
to
find
myself
again
on
the
ledge
we
then
walked
round
considerably
to
the
right
probably
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
there
a
little
spur
in
the
hillside
a
buttress
as
it
were
to
the
ledge
of
which
i
have
spoken
made
the
descent
much
easier
and
i
again
tried
do
not
you
mind
following
me
i
said
to
my
companion
for
i
saw
that
he
looked
much
aghast
none
of
sir
william
party
went
down
there
he
answered
are
you
sure
of
that
i
asked
quite
sure
said
the
mild
voice
then
what
a
triumph
we
will
have
over
sir
william
and
so
saying
i
proceeded
i
think
i
come
too
said
the
mild
voice
if
i
do
break
my
neck
nobody
be
much
the
worse
and
he
did
follow
me
there
was
nothing
very
difficult
in
the
clambering
but
unfortunately
just
as
we
got
to
the
bottom
the
mist
came
pouring
down
upon
us
and
i
could
not
but
bethink
me
that
i
should
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
my
way
up
again
without
seeing
any
of
the
landmarks
i
could
still
see
all
below
me
but
i
could
see
nothing
that
was
above
it
seemed
as
though
the
mist
kept
at
our
own
level
and
that
we
dragged
it
with
us
we
were
soon
in
one
of
the
eight
small
craters
or
mouths
of
which
i
have
spoken
looking
at
them
from
above
they
seemed
to
be
nearly
on
a
level
but
it
now
appeared
that
one
or
two
were
considerably
higher
than
the
others
we
were
now
in
the
one
that
was
the
highest
on
that
side
of
the
excavation
it
was
a
shallow
basin
or
rather
saucer
perhaps
sixty
yards
in
diameter
the
bottom
of
which
was
composed
of
smooth
sandy
clay
in
dry
weather
it
would
partake
almost
of
the
nature
of
sand
many
many
years
had
certainly
rolled
by
since
this
mouth
had
been
eloquent
with
brimstone
the
place
at
this
time
was
very
cold
my
friend
had
brought
a
large
shawl
with
him
with
which
over
and
over
again
he
attempted
to
cover
my
shoulders
i
having
meditated
much
on
the
matter
had
left
my
cloak
above
at
the
present
moment
i
regretted
it
sorely
but
as
matters
turned
out
it
would
have
half
smothered
me
before
our
walk
was
over
we
had
now
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
till
the
mist
should
go
off
there
was
but
one
open
mouth
to
this
mountain
one
veritable
crater
from
which
a
column
of
smoke
and
sulphur
did
then
actually
issue
and
this
though
the
smell
of
the
brimstone
was
already
oppressive
was
at
some
little
distance
gradually
the
mist
did
go
off
or
rather
it
shifted
itself
continually
now
ascending
far
above
us
and
soon
returning
to
our
feet
we
then
advanced
between
two
other
mouths
and
came
to
that
which
was
nearest
to
the
existing
crater
here
the
aperture
was
of
a
very
different
kind
though
no
smoke
issued
from
it
and
though
there
was
a
small
tree
growing
at
the
bottom
of
it
showing
as
i
presume
that
there
had
been
no
eruption
from
thence
since
the
seed
of
that
tree
had
fallen
to
the
ground
yet
the
sides
of
the
crater
were
as
sharp
and
steep
as
the
walls
of
a
house
into
those
which
we
had
hitherto
visited
we
could
walk
easily
into
this
no
one
could
descend
even
a
single
foot
unless
indeed
he
descended
somewhat
more
than
a
foot
so
as
to
dash
himself
to
pieces
at
the
bottom
they
were
when
compared
together
as
the
interior
of
a
plate
compared
to
that
of
a
now
a
traveller
travelling
in
such
realms
would
easily
extricate
himself
from
the
plate
but
the
depths
of
the
would
offer
him
no
hope
having
walked
round
this
mute
volcano
we
ascended
to
the
side
of
the
one
which
was
now
smoking
for
the
aperture
to
this
was
considerably
higher
than
that
of
the
last
one
mentioned
as
we
were
then
situated
the
smoke
was
bearing
towards
us
and
every
moment
it
became
more
oppressive
but
i
saw
or
thought
i
saw
that
we
could
skirt
round
to
the
back
of
the
crater
so
as
not
to
get
its
full
volume
upon
us
and
so
i
proceeded
he
of
the
mild
voice
mildly
expostulating
but
always
following
me
but
when
we
had
ascended
to
the
level
of
the
hole
the
wind
suddenly
shifted
and
the
column
of
smoke
dispersing
enveloped
us
altogether
had
it
come
upon
us
in
all
its
thickest
mass
i
doubt
whether
it
would
not
have
first
stupefied
and
then
choked
us
as
it
was
we
ran
for
it
and
succeeded
in
running
out
of
it
it
affected
me
i
think
more
powerfully
than
it
did
my
companion
for
he
was
the
first
to
regain
his
speech
sir
william
at
any
rate
saw
nothing
like
that
said
he
coughing
triumphantly
i
hope
that
i
may
never
feel
or
smell
anything
like
it
again
this
smoke
is
emitted
from
the
earth
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
hole
very
similar
to
that
above
described
the
sides
of
it
all
round
are
so
steep
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
even
an
attempt
to
descend
it
by
holding
each
other
hands
we
could
look
over
into
it
one
at
a
time
and
see
the
very
jaws
in
the
rock
from
which
the
stream
of
sulphur
ascends
it
comes
out
quite
yellow
almost
a
dark
yellow
but
gradually
blanches
as
it
expands
in
its
course
these
jaws
in
the
rock
are
not
in
the
centre
of
the
bottom
of
the
pit
but
in
a
sharp
angle
as
it
were
so
that
the
smoke
comes
up
against
one
side
or
wall
and
that
side
is
perfectly
encrusted
with
the
sulphur
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
orifice
exactly
opposite
to
this
that
we
knelt
down
and
looked
over
the
smoke
when
it
struck
upon
us
immediately
above
this
wall
was
hot
and
thick
and
full
of
brimstone
the
stench
for
a
moment
was
very
bad
but
the
effect
went
off
at
once
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
it
the
mild
voice
grasped
my
hand
very
tightly
as
he
crept
to
the
edge
and
looked
over
ah
he
said
rejoicing
greatly
sir
william
never
saw
that
nor
any
of
his
party
i
am
so
glad
i
came
again
with
you
i
wonder
whether
anybody
ever
was
here
before
hundreds
doubtless
have
been
and
thousands
will
be
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
in
london
between
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
fifty
would
think
little
of
the
trouble
and
less
of
the
danger
of
getting
there
but
i
could
not
interfere
with
the
triumph
of
my
friend
so
i
merely
remarked
that
it
certainly
was
a
very
singular
place
and
then
we
had
to
reascend
it
was
now
past
eleven
and
as
yet
we
had
had
no
breakfast
for
i
can
not
call
that
cup
of
coffee
which
we
took
at
starting
a
breakfast
even
though
the
german
architect
handed
to
each
of
us
from
out
of
his
bed
a
hunch
of
beef
and
a
crust
of
bread
luckily
the
air
was
clear
for
a
while
so
that
we
could
see
what
we
were
about
and
we
began
to
climb
up
on
the
side
opposite
to
that
by
which
we
had
descended
and
here
i
happened
to
mention
that
miss
ouseley
had
commissioned
me
to
get
two
bits
of
lava
one
smooth
and
the
other
rough
unfortunately
for
at
once
the
mild
voice
declared
that
he
had
found
two
morsels
which
would
exactly
suit
the
lady
taste
i
looked
round
and
lo
there
was
my
small
friend
with
two
huge
stones
each
weighing
about
twenty
pounds
which
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
he
was
endeavouring
to
pack
under
his
arms
now
the
mountain
here
was
very
steep
and
very
friable
the
burnt
shingle
slipped
from
under
our
feet
at
every
step
and
to
make
matters
worse
we
were
climbing
in
a
slanting
direction
my
dear
fellow
it
would
kill
you
to
carry
those
lumps
to
the
top
i
said
do
not
think
of
it
but
he
persevered
there
were
no
lumps
of
lava
such
as
those
he
said
to
be
found
at
the
top
they
were
just
what
miss
ouseley
wanted
he
thought
he
would
be
able
to
manage
with
them
they
were
not
so
very
heavy
if
only
the
ground
did
not
slip
so
much
i
said
what
i
could
but
it
was
of
no
avail
and
he
followed
me
slowly
with
his
sore
burden
i
never
knew
the
weather
change
with
such
rapidity
at
this
moment
the
sun
was
bright
and
very
hot
and
i
could
hardly
bear
my
coat
on
my
shoulders
as
i
crept
up
that
hill
how
my
little
friend
followed
with
his
shawl
and
the
lava
rocks
i
can
not
conceive
but
to
own
the
truth
going
down
hill
suits
me
better
than
going
up
years
and
obesity
tell
upon
the
wind
sooner
than
they
do
on
the
legs
so
at
least
it
is
with
me
now
my
mild
friend
hardly
weighed
fifteen
ounces
while
i
and
then
when
we
were
again
on
the
ridge
it
began
to
rain
most
gloriously
hitherto
we
had
had
mist
but
this
was
a
regular
of
rain
such
moisture
as
the
secretary
of
legation
had
been
praying
for
ever
since
we
started
again
and
again
the
mild
voice
offered
me
the
shawl
which
when
i
refused
it
he
wrapped
round
the
lumps
of
lava
scorning
to
be
drier
than
his
companion
from
the
summit
to
the
ledge
we
had
come
down
fast
enough
but
the
ascent
was
very
different
i
at
any
rate
was
very
tired
and
my
friend
was
by
no
means
as
fresh
as
he
had
been
we
were
both
in
want
of
food
and
our
clothes
were
heavy
with
wet
he
also
still
carried
his
lumps
of
lava
at
last
all
raining
as
it
was
i
sat
down
how
far
we
might
still
be
from
the
top
i
could
not
see
but
be
it
far
or
be
it
near
nature
required
rest
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
the
mild
voice
not
unwillingly
crouched
down
close
to
me
now
we
can
both
have
the
shawl
said
he
and
he
put
it
over
our
joint
shoulders
that
is
he
put
the
shawl
on
mine
while
the
fringe
hung
over
his
own
in
half
a
minute
we
were
both
asleep
almost
in
each
other
arms
men
when
they
sleep
thus
on
a
in
the
rain
do
not
usually
sleep
long
forty
winks
is
generally
acknowledged
our
nap
may
have
amounted
to
eighty
each
but
i
doubt
whether
it
was
more
we
started
together
rubbed
our
eyes
jumped
to
our
feet
and
prepared
ourselves
for
work
but
alas
where
was
the
lava
my
impression
is
that
in
my
sleep
i
must
have
kicked
the
stones
and
sent
them
rolling
at
any
rate
they
were
gone
dark
and
wet
as
it
was
we
both
went
down
a
yard
or
two
but
it
was
in
vain
nothing
could
be
seen
of
them
the
mild
voice
handed
me
the
shawl
preparing
to
descend
in
their
search
but
this
was
too
much
you
will
only
lose
yourself
said
i
laying
hold
of
him
and
i
shall
have
to
look
for
your
bones
besides
i
want
my
breakfast
we
will
get
other
specimens
above
and
perhaps
they
will
be
just
as
good
said
he
cheerfully
when
he
found
that
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
have
his
way
every
bit
said
i
and
so
we
trudged
on
and
at
last
reached
our
mules
from
this
point
men
see
or
think
that
they
see
the
two
oceans
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
and
this
sight
to
many
is
one
of
the
main
objects
of
the
ascent
we
saw
neither
the
one
ocean
nor
the
other
we
got
back
to
the
potrero
about
three
and
found
our
german
friends
just
sitting
down
to
dinner
the
architect
was
seated
on
his
bed
on
one
side
of
the
table
arranging
the
viands
while
the
doctor
on
the
other
scooped
out
the
brains
of
a
strange
bird
with
a
penknife
the
latter
operation
he
performed
with
a
view
of
stuffing
not
himself
but
the
animal
they
pressed
us
to
dine
with
them
before
we
started
and
we
did
so
though
i
must
confess
that
the
doctor
occupation
rather
set
me
against
my
food
if
it
be
not
done
at
once
said
he
apologizing
it
ca
he
done
well
and
he
scraped
and
scraped
and
wiped
his
knife
against
the
edge
of
the
little
table
on
which
the
dishes
were
placed
what
had
become
of
the
doctor
wife
i
do
not
know
but
she
was
not
at
the
potrero
when
we
dined
there
it
was
evening
when
we
got
into
cartago
and
very
tired
we
were
my
mind
however
was
made
up
to
go
on
to
san
josé
that
night
and
ultimately
i
did
so
but
before
starting
i
was
bound
to
repeat
my
visit
to
the
english
lady
with
whom
my
mild
friend
lived
x
was
and
i
suppose
is
the
only
englishwoman
living
in
cartago
and
with
that
sudden
intimacy
which
springs
up
with
more
than
tropical
celerity
in
such
places
she
told
me
the
singular
history
of
her
married
life
the
reader
would
not
care
that
i
should
repeat
it
at
length
for
it
would
make
this
chapter
too
long
her
husband
had
been
engaged
in
mining
operations
and
she
had
come
out
to
guatemala
with
him
in
search
of
gold
from
thence
after
a
period
of
partial
success
he
was
enticed
away
into
costa
rica
some
speculation
there
in
which
he
or
his
partners
were
concerned
promised
better
than
that
other
one
in
guatemala
and
he
went
leaving
his
young
wife
and
children
behind
him
of
course
he
was
to
return
very
soon
and
of
course
he
did
not
return
at
all
x
was
left
with
her
children
searching
for
gold
herself
every
evening
she
said
i
saw
the
earth
washed
myself
and
took
up
with
me
to
the
house
the
gold
that
was
found
what
an
occupation
for
a
young
englishwoman
the
mother
of
three
children
at
this
time
she
spoke
no
spanish
and
had
no
one
with
her
who
spoke
english
and
then
tidings
came
from
her
husband
that
he
could
not
come
to
her
and
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
to
him
she
had
no
money
the
having
failed
her
children
were
without
shoes
to
their
feet
she
had
no
female
companion
she
had
no
attendant
but
one
native
man
and
yet
starting
from
the
middle
of
guatemala
she
made
her
way
to
the
coast
and
thence
by
ship
to
costa
rica
after
that
her
husband
became
engaged
in
what
in
those
countries
is
called
transit
now
transit
means
the
privilege
of
making
money
by
transporting
americans
of
the
united
states
over
the
isthmus
to
and
from
california
and
in
most
hands
has
led
to
fraud
filibustering
ruin
and
destruction
x
like
many
others
was
taken
in
and
according
to
his
widow
account
the
matter
ended
in
a
deputation
being
sent
from
new
york
i
think
to
murder
him
he
was
struck
with
a
in
the
streets
of
san
josé
never
fully
recovered
from
the
blow
and
then
died
he
had
become
possessed
of
a
small
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cartago
on
the
proceeds
of
which
the
widow
was
now
living
and
will
you
not
return
home
i
said
yes
when
i
have
got
my
rights
look
here
and
she
brought
down
a
ledger
showing
me
that
she
had
all
manner
of
claims
to
all
manner
of
shares
in
all
manner
of
mines
aurum
irrepertum
et
sic
melius
situm
as
regards
her
it
certainly
would
have
been
so
for
a
coined
sovereign
or
piece
i
have
the
most
profound
respect
it
is
about
the
most
faithful
servant
that
a
man
can
have
in
his
employment
and
should
be
held
as
by
no
means
subject
to
those
scurrilous
attacks
which
a
pharisaically
moral
world
so
often
levels
at
its
head
but
of
all
objects
of
a
man
ambition
uncoined
gold
gold
to
be
collected
in
sand
or
picked
up
in
nuggets
or
washed
out
of
earth
is
to
my
thinking
the
most
delusive
and
most
dangerous
who
knows
or
has
known
or
ever
seen
any
man
that
has
returned
happy
from
the
diggings
and
now
sits
contented
under
his
own
my
friend
x
was
still
hankering
after
the
of
egypt
the
hidden
gold
of
the
central
american
mountains
she
slapped
her
hands
loudly
together
for
she
was
a
woman
of
much
energy
and
declared
that
she
would
have
her
rights
when
she
had
gotten
her
rights
she
would
go
home
alas
alas
poor
lady
and
you
said
i
to
the
mild
voice
will
not
you
return
i
suppose
so
said
he
when
x
goes
and
he
looked
up
to
the
widow
as
though
confessing
that
he
was
bound
to
her
service
and
would
not
leave
her
not
that
i
think
they
had
the
slightest
idea
of
joining
their
lots
together
as
men
and
women
do
he
was
too
mild
for
that
i
did
ride
back
to
san
josé
that
night
and
a
most
frightful
journey
i
had
of
it
i
resumed
of
course
my
speechless
useless
dolt
of
a
guide
the
man
whom
the
secretary
of
legation
had
selected
for
me
before
i
started
again
i
put
my
spur
on
his
foot
and
endeavoured
to
spirit
him
up
to
ride
before
me
so
that
i
might
know
my
way
in
the
dark
but
it
was
in
vain
nothing
would
move
him
out
of
a
walk
and
i
was
obliged
to
leave
him
and
then
it
became
frightfully
dark
pitch
dark
as
men
say
dark
so
that
i
could
not
see
my
mule
ears
i
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
trust
to
her
and
soon
found
by
being
taken
down
into
the
deep
bed
of
a
river
and
through
deep
water
that
we
had
left
the
road
by
which
i
had
before
travelled
the
beast
did
not
live
in
san
josé
i
knew
and
i
looked
to
be
carried
to
some
country
rancho
at
which
she
would
be
at
home
but
in
a
time
sufficiently
short
i
found
myself
in
san
josé
the
creature
had
known
a
shorter
cut
than
that
usually
taken
chapter
xx
central
america
san
josé
to
greytown
my
purpose
was
to
go
right
through
central
america
from
ocean
to
ocean
and
to
accomplish
this
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
now
make
my
way
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
san
juan
river
to
san
juan
del
norte
as
it
was
formerly
called
or
greytown
as
it
is
now
named
by
the
english
this
road
i
was
informed
by
all
of
whom
i
inquired
was
very
bad
so
bad
as
to
be
all
but
impracticable
to
english
travellers
and
then
just
at
that
moment
an
event
occurred
which
added
greatly
to
the
ill
name
of
this
route
a
few
days
before
i
reached
san
josé
a
gentleman
resident
there
had
started
for
england
with
his
wife
and
they
had
decided
upon
going
by
the
san
juan
it
seems
that
the
lady
had
reached
san
josé
as
all
people
do
reach
it
by
panamá
and
and
had
suffered
on
the
route
at
any
rate
she
had
taken
a
dislike
to
it
and
had
resolved
on
returning
by
the
san
juan
and
the
serapiqui
rivers
a
route
which
is
called
the
serapiqui
road
to
do
this
it
is
necessary
for
the
traveller
to
ride
on
mules
for
four
five
or
six
days
according
to
his
or
her
capability
the
serapiqui
river
is
then
reached
and
from
that
point
the
further
journey
is
made
in
canoes
down
the
serapiqui
river
till
it
falls
into
the
san
juan
and
then
down
that
river
to
greytown
this
gentleman
with
his
wife
reached
the
serapiqui
in
safety
though
it
seems
that
she
suffered
greatly
on
the
road
but
when
once
there
as
she
herself
said
all
her
troubles
were
over
that
weary
work
of
supporting
herself
on
her
mule
through
mud
and
thorns
and
thick
bushes
of
scrambling
over
precipices
and
through
rivers
was
done
she
had
been
very
despondent
even
from
before
the
time
of
her
starting
but
now
she
said
she
believed
that
she
should
live
to
see
her
mother
again
she
was
seated
in
the
narrow
canoe
among
cloaks
and
cushions
with
her
husband
close
to
her
and
the
boat
was
pushed
into
the
stream
almost
in
a
moment
within
two
minutes
of
starting
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
place
where
she
had
last
trod
the
canoe
struck
against
a
snag
or
upturned
fragment
of
a
tree
and
was
overset
the
lady
was
borne
by
the
stream
among
the
entangled
branches
of
timber
which
clogged
the
river
and
when
her
body
was
found
life
had
been
long
extinct
this
had
happened
on
the
very
day
that
i
reached
san
josé
and
the
news
arrived
two
or
three
days
afterwards
the
wretched
husband
too
made
his
way
back
to
the
town
finding
himself
unable
to
go
on
upon
his
journey
alone
with
such
a
burden
on
his
back
what
could
he
have
said
to
his
young
wife
mother
when
she
came
to
meet
him
at
southampton
expecting
to
throw
her
arms
round
her
daughter
i
was
again
lucky
in
having
a
companion
for
my
journey
a
young
lieutenant
of
the
navy
fitzm
by
name
whose
vessel
was
lying
at
greytown
had
made
his
way
up
to
san
josé
on
a
visit
to
the
ouseleys
and
was
to
return
at
the
same
time
that
i
went
down
he
had
indeed
travelled
up
with
the
bereaved
man
who
had
lost
his
wife
having
read
the
funeral
service
over
the
poor
woman
grave
on
the
lonely
shores
of
the
serapiqui
the
road
he
acknowledged
was
bad
too
bad
he
thought
for
any
female
but
not
more
than
sufficiently
so
to
make
proper
excitement
for
a
man
he
at
any
rate
had
come
over
it
safely
but
then
he
was
and
i
and
so
we
started
together
from
san
josé
a
crowd
of
friends
accompanying
us
for
the
first
mile
or
two
there
was
that
secretary
of
legation
prophesying
that
we
should
be
smothered
in
the
mud
there
was
the
consul
and
the
consul
brother
nor
was
female
beauty
wanting
to
wish
us
well
on
our
road
and
maybe
to
fling
an
old
shoe
after
us
for
luck
as
we
went
upon
our
journey
we
took
four
mules
that
was
one
each
for
ourselves
and
two
for
our
baggage
we
had
two
guides
or
muleteers
according
to
bargain
both
of
whom
travelled
on
foot
the
understanding
was
that
one
mule
lightly
laden
with
provisions
and
a
pair
of
slippers
and
should
accompany
us
one
man
also
going
with
us
but
that
the
mule
should
come
along
after
us
at
its
own
pace
things
however
did
not
so
turn
out
on
the
first
day
both
the
men
and
both
the
mules
lagged
behind
and
on
one
occasion
we
were
obliged
to
wait
above
an
hour
for
them
but
after
that
we
all
kept
in
a
string
together
having
picked
up
a
third
muleteer
somewhere
on
the
road
we
had
also
with
us
a
distressed
british
subject
who
was
intrusted
to
my
tender
mercies
by
the
consul
at
san
josé
he
was
not
a
good
sample
of
a
britisher
he
had
been
a
in
california
then
a
filibuster
after
that
a
teacher
of
the
piano
in
the
country
part
of
costa
rica
and
lastly
an
omnibus
driver
he
was
to
act
as
interpreter
for
us
which
however
he
did
not
do
with
much
honesty
or
zeal
our
road
at
first
lay
through
the
towns
of
aredia
and
barba
the
former
of
which
is
a
little
village
where
however
we
found
great
difficulty
in
getting
anything
to
drink
up
to
this
and
for
a
few
leagues
further
the
road
was
very
fair
and
the
land
on
each
side
of
us
was
cultivated
we
had
started
at
eight
and
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
there
seemed
to
be
great
doubt
as
to
where
we
should
stop
the
leading
muleteer
wished
to
take
us
to
a
house
of
a
friend
of
his
own
whereas
the
lieutenant
and
i
resolved
that
the
day
work
had
not
been
long
enough
i
take
it
that
on
the
whole
we
were
right
and
the
man
gave
in
with
sufficient
good
humour
but
it
ended
in
our
passing
the
night
in
a
miserable
rancho
that
at
the
potrero
on
the
road
to
the
volcanic
mountain
had
been
a
palace
to
it
and
here
we
got
into
the
forest
we
had
hitherto
been
ascending
the
whole
way
from
san
josé
and
had
by
degrees
lost
all
appearance
of
tillage
still
however
there
had
been
open
spaces
here
and
there
cleared
for
cattle
and
we
had
not
as
yet
found
ourselves
absolutely
enveloped
by
woods
this
rancho
was
called
and
certainly
the
view
from
it
was
very
pretty
it
was
pretty
and
extensive
as
i
have
seen
views
in
baden
and
parts
of
bavaria
but
again
there
was
nothing
about
which
i
could
rave
i
shall
not
readily
forget
the
night
in
that
rancho
we
were
i
presume
between
seven
and
eight
thousand
feet
above
the
and
at
night
or
rather
early
in
the
morning
the
cold
was
very
severe
fitzm
and
i
shared
the
same
bed
that
is
we
lay
on
the
same
boards
and
did
what
we
could
to
cover
ourselves
with
the
same
blankets
in
that
country
men
commonly
ride
upon
blankets
having
them
strapped
over
the
saddles
as
pillions
and
we
had
come
so
provided
but
before
the
morning
was
over
i
heartily
wished
for
a
double
allowance
we
had
brought
with
us
a
wallet
of
provisions
certainly
not
too
well
arranged
by
sir
william
ouseley
most
reprehensible
butler
travellers
should
never
trust
to
butlers
our
piece
de
résistance
was
a
ham
and
lo
it
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
one
when
the
truth
of
this
fact
first
dawned
upon
us
it
was
in
both
our
minds
to
go
back
and
slay
that
butler
but
there
was
still
a
piece
of
beef
and
some
chickens
and
there
had
been
a
few
dozen
of
eggs
but
fitzm
would
amuse
himself
with
eating
these
all
along
the
road
i
always
found
when
the
ordinary
feeding
time
came
that
they
had
not
had
the
slightest
effect
upon
his
appetite
on
the
next
morning
we
again
ascended
for
about
a
couple
of
leagues
and
as
long
as
we
did
so
the
road
was
still
good
the
surface
was
hard
and
the
track
was
broad
and
a
horseman
could
wish
nothing
better
and
then
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
ridge
over
which
we
were
passing
this
we
did
at
a
place
called
desenganos
and
from
thence
we
looked
down
into
vast
valleys
all
running
towards
the
atlantic
hitherto
the
fall
of
water
had
been
into
the
pacific
at
this
place
we
found
a
vast
shed
with
numberless
bins
and
troughs
lying
under
it
in
great
confusion
the
facts
as
far
as
i
could
learn
were
thus
up
to
this
point
the
government
that
is
don
juan
mora
or
perhaps
his
predecessor
had
succeeded
in
making
a
road
fit
for
the
transit
of
mule
carts
this
shed
had
also
been
built
to
afford
shelter
for
the
postmen
and
accommodation
for
the
muleteers
but
here
don
juan
efforts
had
been
stopped
money
probably
had
failed
and
the
great
remainder
of
the
undertaking
will
i
fear
be
left
undone
for
many
a
long
year
and
yet
this
or
some
other
road
from
the
valley
of
san
josé
to
the
atlantic
would
be
the
natural
outlet
of
the
country
at
present
the
coffee
grown
in
the
central
high
lands
is
carried
down
to
on
the
pacific
although
it
must
cross
the
atlantic
to
reach
its
market
consequently
it
is
either
taken
round
the
horn
and
its
sale
thus
delayed
for
months
or
it
is
transported
across
the
isthmus
by
railway
at
an
enormous
cost
they
say
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
atlantic
may
be
reached
more
easily
than
by
the
present
route
of
the
serapiqui
river
nothing
however
has
as
yet
been
done
in
the
matter
to
make
a
road
fit
even
for
mule
carts
by
the
course
of
the
present
track
would
certainly
be
a
work
of
enormous
difficulty
and
now
our
vexations
commenced
we
found
that
the
path
very
soon
narrowed
so
much
so
that
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
keep
our
hats
on
our
heads
and
then
the
surface
of
the
path
became
softer
and
softer
till
our
beasts
were
up
to
their
knees
in
mud
all
motion
quicker
than
that
of
a
walk
became
impossible
and
even
at
this
pace
the
struggles
in
the
mud
were
both
frequent
and
uncomfortable
hitherto
we
had
talked
fluently
enough
but
now
we
became
very
silent
we
went
on
following
each
at
the
other
tail
floundering
in
the
mud
silent
filthy
and
down
in
the
mouth
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
fitzm
at
last
stopping
on
the
road
for
he
had
led
the
van
i
ca
go
any
further
without
breakfast
we
referred
the
matter
to
the
guide
and
found
that
careblanco
the
place
appointed
for
our
next
stage
was
still
two
hours
distant
two
hours
why
half
an
hour
since
you
said
it
was
only
a
league
but
what
is
the
use
of
expostulating
with
a
man
who
ca
speak
a
word
of
english
so
we
got
off
our
mules
and
draped
out
our
wallet
among
the
bushes
our
eggs
were
all
gone
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
travelling
did
not
add
fresh
delights
to
the
cold
beef
so
we
devoured
another
fowl
and
washed
it
down
with
brandy
and
water
as
we
were
so
engaged
three
men
passed
us
with
heavy
burdens
on
their
backs
they
were
tall
thin
muscular
fellows
with
bare
legs
and
linen
clothes
one
of
them
apparently
of
nearly
pure
indian
blood
it
was
clear
that
the
loads
they
carried
were
very
weighty
they
were
borne
high
up
on
the
back
and
suspended
by
a
band
from
the
forehead
so
that
a
great
portion
of
the
weight
must
have
fallen
on
the
muscles
of
the
neck
this
was
the
post
and
as
they
had
left
san
josé
some
eight
hours
after
us
and
had
come
by
a
longer
route
so
as
to
take
in
another
town
they
must
have
travelled
at
a
very
fast
pace
it
was
our
object
to
go
down
the
serapiqui
river
in
the
same
boat
with
the
post
we
had
some
doubt
whether
we
should
be
able
to
get
any
other
seeing
that
the
owner
of
one
such
canoe
had
been
drowned
i
believe
in
an
endeavour
to
save
the
unfortunate
lady
of
whom
i
have
spoken
and
any
boat
taken
separately
would
be
much
more
expensive
so
as
quick
as
might
be
we
tied
up
our
fragments
and
proceeded
it
was
after
this
that
i
really
learned
how
is
the
force
of
mud
we
came
at
last
to
a
track
that
was
divided
crossways
by
ridges
somewhat
like
the
ridges
of
ploughed
ground
each
ridge
was
perhaps
a
foot
and
a
half
broad
and
the
mules
invariably
stepped
between
them
not
on
them
stepping
on
them
they
could
not
have
held
their
feet
stepping
between
them
they
came
at
each
step
with
their
belly
to
the
ground
so
that
the
rider
feet
and
legs
were
trailing
in
the
mud
the
struggles
of
the
poor
brutes
were
dreadful
it
seemed
to
me
frequently
impossible
that
my
beast
should
extricate
himself
laden
as
he
was
but
still
he
went
on
patiently
slowly
and
continuously
splash
splash
slosh
slosh
every
muscle
of
his
body
was
working
and
every
muscle
of
my
body
was
working
also
for
it
is
not
very
easy
to
sit
upon
a
mule
under
such
circumstances
the
bushes
were
so
close
upon
me
that
one
hand
was
required
to
guard
my
face
from
the
thorns
my
knees
were
constantly
in
contact
with
the
stumps
of
trees
and
when
my
knees
were
free
from
such
difficulties
my
shins
were
sure
to
be
in
the
wars
then
the
poor
animal
rolled
so
from
side
to
side
in
his
incredible
struggles
with
the
mud
that
it
was
frequently
necessary
to
hold
myself
on
by
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
added
to
this
it
was
essentially
necessary
to
keep
some
sort
of
guide
upon
the
creature
steps
or
one
legs
would
be
absolutely
broken
for
the
mule
cares
for
himself
only
and
not
for
his
rider
it
is
nothing
to
him
if
a
man
knees
be
put
out
of
joint
against
the
stump
of
a
tree
splash
splash
slosh
slosh
on
we
went
in
this
way
for
hours
almost
without
speaking
on
such
occasions
one
is
apt
to
become
mentally
cross
to
feel
that
the
world
is
too
hard
for
one
that
one
own
especial
troubles
are
much
worse
than
those
of
neighbours
and
that
those
neighbours
are
unfairly
favoured
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
very
unjust
that
i
should
be
fifteen
stone
while
fitzm
was
only
eight
and
as
for
that
distressed
britisher
he
weighed
nothing
at
all
splash
splash
slosh
slosh
we
were
at
it
all
day
at
careblanco
the
place
of
the
i
understood
it
to
mean
they
say
that
there
is
a
race
of
wild
hogs
with
white
faces
which
inhabit
the
woods
hereabouts
we
overtook
the
post
and
kept
close
to
them
afterwards
this
was
a
pasture
farm
in
the
very
middle
of
the
forest
a
bit
of
cleared
land
on
which
some
adventurer
had
settled
himself
and
dared
to
live
the
adventurer
himself
was
not
there
but
he
had
a
very
pretty
wife
with
whom
my
friend
the
lieutenant
seemed
to
have
contracted
an
intimate
acquaintance
on
his
previous
journey
up
to
san
josé
but
at
careblanco
we
only
stopped
two
minutes
during
which
however
it
became
necessary
that
the
lieutenant
should
go
into
the
rancho
on
the
matter
of
some
article
of
clothes
which
had
been
left
behind
on
his
previous
journey
and
then
again
on
we
went
slosh
slosh
splash
splash
my
shins
by
this
time
were
black
and
blue
and
i
held
myself
on
to
my
mule
chiefly
by
my
spurs
our
way
was
still
through
dense
forest
and
was
always
either
up
or
down
hill
and
here
we
came
across
the
grandest
scenery
that
i
met
with
in
the
western
world
scenery
which
would
admit
of
raving
if
it
were
given
to
me
to
rave
on
such
a
subject
we
were
travelling
for
the
most
part
along
the
side
of
a
volcanic
mountain
and
every
now
and
then
the
declivity
would
become
so
steep
as
to
give
us
a
full
view
down
into
the
ravine
below
with
the
prospect
of
the
grand
steep
wooded
hill
on
the
other
side
one
huge
forest
stretching
up
the
mountain
for
miles
at
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
one
eye
would
just
catch
a
river
looking
like
a
moving
thread
of
silver
wire
and
yet
though
the
descent
was
so
great
there
would
be
no
interruption
to
it
looking
down
over
the
thick
forest
trees
which
grew
almost
from
the
side
of
a
precipice
the
eye
would
reach
the
river
some
thousand
feet
below
and
then
ascend
on
the
other
side
over
a
like
unbroken
expanse
of
foliage
of
course
we
both
declared
that
we
had
never
seen
anything
to
equal
it
in
moments
of
ecstasy
one
always
does
so
declare
but
there
was
a
monotony
about
it
and
a
want
of
grouping
which
forbids
me
to
place
it
on
an
equality
with
scenery
really
of
the
highest
kind
with
the
mountains
for
instance
round
colico
with
the
head
of
the
lake
of
the
four
cantons
or
even
with
the
views
of
the
upper
waters
of
killarney
and
then
to
speak
the
truth
we
were
too
much
engulfed
in
mud
too
thoughtful
as
to
the
troubles
of
the
road
to
enjoy
it
thoroughly
wonderful
that
is
it
yes
very
wonderful
fine
break
for
heaven
sake
do
get
on
that
is
the
tone
which
men
are
apt
to
adopt
under
such
circumstances
five
or
six
pounds
of
thick
mud
clinging
round
one
boots
and
inside
one
trousers
do
not
add
to
enjoyment
of
scenery
mud
mud
mud
mud
at
about
five
we
splashed
into
another
pasture
farm
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
a
place
called
san
miguel
and
there
we
rested
for
that
night
here
we
found
that
our
beef
also
must
be
thrown
away
and
that
our
bread
was
all
gone
we
had
picked
up
some
more
eggs
at
ranchos
on
the
road
but
eggs
to
my
companion
were
no
more
than
grains
of
gravel
to
a
fowl
they
merely
enabled
him
to
enjoy
his
regular
diet
at
this
place
however
we
were
able
to
purchase
fowls
skinny
old
hens
which
were
shot
for
us
at
a
moment
warning
the
price
being
here
and
elsewhere
along
the
road
a
dollar
a
head
tea
and
candles
a
ministering
angel
had
given
to
me
at
the
moment
of
my
departure
from
san
josé
but
for
them
we
should
have
indeed
been
comfortless
thirsty
and
in
utter
darkness
towards
evening
a
man
gets
tired
of
brandy
and
water
when
he
has
been
drinking
it
since
six
in
the
morning
our
washing
was
done
under
great
difficulties
as
in
these
districts
neither
nature
nor
art
seems
to
have
provided
for
such
emergencies
in
this
place
i
got
my
head
into
a
tin
pot
and
could
hardly
extricate
it
but
even
inside
the
houses
and
ranchos
everything
seemed
to
turn
into
mud
the
floor
beneath
one
feet
became
mud
with
the
splashing
of
the
water
the
boards
were
begrimed
with
mud
we
were
offered
coffee
that
was
mud
to
the
taste
and
touch
i
felt
that
the
blood
in
my
veins
was
becoming
muddy
and
then
we
had
another
day
exactly
like
the
former
except
that
the
ground
was
less
steep
and
the
vistas
of
scenery
less
grand
the
weather
also
was
warmer
seeing
that
we
were
now
on
lower
ground
monkeys
chattered
on
the
trees
around
us
and
the
little
congo
ape
roared
like
a
lion
macaws
flew
about
generally
in
pairs
and
we
saw
white
turkeys
on
the
trees
up
on
the
higher
forests
we
had
seen
none
of
these
animals
there
are
wild
hogs
also
in
these
woods
and
ounces
the
ounce
here
is
i
believe
properly
styled
the
puma
though
the
people
always
call
them
lions
they
grow
to
about
the
size
of
a
newfoundland
dog
the
wild
cat
also
is
common
here
the
people
styling
them
tigers
the
xagua
is
i
take
it
their
proper
name
none
of
these
animals
will
i
believe
attack
a
man
unless
provoked
or
pressed
in
pursuit
and
not
even
then
if
a
way
of
escape
be
open
to
him
we
again
breakfasted
at
a
forest
clearing
paying
a
dollar
each
for
tough
old
hens
and
in
the
evening
we
came
to
a
cacao
plantation
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
which
had
been
laid
out
and
settled
by
an
american
of
the
united
states
residing
in
central
america
this
place
is
not
far
from
the
serapiqui
river
and
is
called
padregal
it
was
here
that
the
young
lieutenant
had
read
the
funeral
service
over
the
body
of
that
unfortunate
lady
i
went
with
him
to
visit
the
grave
it
was
a
spot
in
the
middle
of
a
grass
enclosure
fenced
off
rudely
so
as
to
guard
it
from
beasts
of
prey
the
funeral
had
taken
place
after
dusk
it
had
been
attended
by
some
twelve
or
fourteen
costa
rican
soldiers
who
are
kept
in
a
fort
a
little
below
on
the
banks
of
the
serapiqui
each
of
these
men
had
held
a
torch
the
husband
was
there
and
another
englishman
who
was
travelling
with
him
as
was
also
i
believe
the
proprietor
of
the
place
so
attended
the
body
of
the
englishwoman
was
committed
to
its
strange
grave
in
a
strange
country
here
we
picked
up
another
man
an
american
who
also
had
been
looking
for
gold
and
perhaps
doing
a
turn
as
a
filibuster
him
too
the
world
had
used
badly
and
he
was
about
to
return
with
all
his
golden
dreams
unaccomplished
we
had
one
more
stage
down
to
the
spot
at
which
we
were
to
embark
in
the
canoe
the
spot
at
which
the
lady
had
been
drowned
and
this
one
we
accomplished
early
in
the
morning
this
place
is
called
the
muelle
and
here
there
is
a
fort
with
a
commandant
and
a
small
company
of
soldiers
the
business
of
the
commandant
is
to
let
no
one
up
or
down
the
river
without
a
passport
and
as
a
passport
can
not
be
procured
anywhere
nearer
than
san
josé
here
may
arise
a
great
difficulty
to
travellers
we
were
duly
provided
but
our
american
friend
was
not
and
he
was
simply
told
that
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
get
into
a
boat
on
the
river
i
never
seed
such
a
d
d
country
in
my
life
said
the
american
they
would
not
let
me
leave
san
josé
till
i
paid
every
shilling
i
owed
and
now
that
i
have
paid
i
ai
no
better
off
i
wish
i
had
paid
a
d
d
cent
i
advised
him
to
try
what
some
further
operation
in
the
way
of
payment
would
do
and
with
this
view
he
retired
with
the
commandant
in
a
minute
or
two
they
both
returned
and
the
commandant
said
he
would
look
at
his
instructions
again
he
did
so
and
declared
that
he
now
found
it
was
compatible
with
his
public
duty
to
allow
the
american
to
pass
but
i
shall
not
have
a
cent
left
to
take
me
home
said
the
american
to
me
he
was
not
a
smart
man
though
he
talked
smart
for
when
the
moment
of
departure
came
all
the
places
in
the
boat
were
taken
and
we
left
him
standing
on
the
shore
well
darned
he
said
and
we
neither
heard
nor
saw
more
of
him
that
passage
down
the
serapiqui
was
not
without
interest
though
it
was
somewhat
monotonous
here
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
found
my
bulk
and
size
to
be
of
advantage
to
me
in
the
after
part
of
the
canoe
sat
the
master
boatman
the
captain
of
the
expedition
steering
with
a
paddle
then
came
the
mails
and
our
luggage
and
next
to
them
i
sat
having
a
seat
to
myself
being
too
weighty
to
share
a
bench
with
a
neighbour
i
therefore
could
lean
back
among
the
luggage
and
with
a
cigar
in
my
mouth
with
a
little
wooden
bicher
of
weak
brandy
and
water
beside
me
i
found
that
the
position
had
its
charms
on
the
next
thwart
sat
cheek
by
jowl
the
lieutenant
and
the
distressed
britisher
unfortunately
they
had
nothing
on
which
to
lean
and
i
sincerely
pitied
my
friend
who
i
fear
did
not
enjoy
his
position
but
what
could
i
do
any
change
in
our
arrangements
would
have
upset
the
canoe
and
then
close
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
sat
the
two
natives
paddling
and
they
did
paddle
without
cessation
all
that
day
and
all
the
next
till
we
reached
greytown
the
serapiqui
is
a
fine
river
very
rapid
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
make
it
dangerous
if
care
be
taken
to
avoid
the
snags
there
is
not
a
house
or
hut
on
either
side
of
it
but
the
forest
comes
down
to
the
very
brink
up
in
the
huge
trees
the
monkeys
hung
jabbering
shaking
their
ugly
heads
at
the
boat
as
it
went
down
or
screaming
in
anger
at
this
invasion
of
their
territories
the
macaws
flew
high
over
head
making
their
own
music
and
then
there
was
the
constant
little
splash
of
the
paddle
in
the
water
the
boatmen
spoke
no
word
but
worked
on
always
pausing
now
and
again
for
a
moment
to
drink
out
of
the
hollow
of
their
hands
and
the
sun
became
hotter
and
hotter
as
we
neared
the
sea
and
the
musquitoes
began
to
bite
and
cigars
were
lit
with
greater
frequency
is
thus
that
one
goes
down
the
waters
of
the
serapiqui
about
three
we
got
into
the
san
juan
this
is
the
river
by
which
the
great
lake
of
nicaragua
empties
itself
into
the
sea
which
has
been
the
channel
used
by
the
transit
companies
who
have
passed
from
ocean
to
ocean
through
nicaragua
which
has
been
so
violently
interfered
with
by
filibusters
till
all
such
transit
has
been
banished
from
its
waters
and
which
has
now
been
selected
by
belly
as
the
course
for
his
impossible
canal
it
has
seen
dreadful
scenes
of
cruelty
wrong
and
bloodshed
now
it
runs
along
peaceably
enough
in
its
broad
shallow
swift
course
bearing
on
its
margin
here
and
there
the
rancho
and
of
some
wild
settler
who
has
sought
to
overcome
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressor
wrong
the
proud
man
contumely
by
looking
for
bread
and
shelter
on
those
sad
sunburnt
and
solitary
banks
we
landed
at
one
such
place
to
dine
and
at
another
to
sleep
selecting
in
each
place
some
better
class
of
habitation
at
neither
place
did
we
find
the
owner
there
but
persons
left
in
charge
of
the
place
at
the
first
the
man
was
a
german
a
singularly
handsome
and
dirty
individual
who
never
shaved
or
washed
himself
and
lived
there
ever
alone
on
bananas
and
he
gave
us
fruit
to
take
into
the
boat
with
us
and
when
we
parted
we
shook
hands
with
him
out
here
every
one
always
does
shake
hands
with
every
one
but
as
i
did
so
i
tendered
him
a
dollar
he
had
waited
upon
us
bringing
water
and
plates
he
had
gathered
fruit
for
us
and
he
was
after
all
no
more
than
the
servant
of
the
river
squatter
but
he
let
the
dollar
fall
to
the
ground
and
that
with
some
anger
in
his
face
the
sum
was
made
up
of
the
small
silver
change
of
the
country
and
i
felt
rather
little
as
i
stooped
under
the
hot
sun
to
pick
it
up
from
out
the
mud
of
the
garden
better
that
than
seem
to
leave
it
there
in
anger
it
is
often
hard
for
a
traveller
to
know
when
he
is
wished
to
pay
and
when
he
is
wished
not
to
pay
a
individual
in
raiment
and
position
than
that
german
i
have
seldom
seen
but
he
despised
my
dollar
as
though
it
had
been
dirt
we
slept
at
the
house
of
a
greytown
merchant
who
had
maintained
an
establishment
up
the
river
originally
with
the
view
of
supplying
the
wants
of
the
american
travellers
passing
in
transit
across
the
isthmus
the
steamers
which
did
some
five
or
six
years
since
ply
upon
the
river
used
to
take
in
wood
here
and
stop
for
the
night
and
the
passengers
were
wont
to
come
on
shore
and
call
for
rum
and
brandy
and
in
this
way
much
money
was
made
till
after
a
time
filibusters
came
instead
of
passengers
men
who
took
all
the
wood
that
they
could
find
there
hundreds
of
dollars
worth
of
sawn
wood
and
brandy
also
took
it
away
with
them
saying
that
they
would
give
compensation
when
they
were
established
in
the
country
but
made
no
present
payment
and
then
it
became
tolerably
clear
that
the
time
for
making
money
in
that
locality
had
passed
away
they
came
in
great
numbers
on
one
such
occasion
and
stripped
away
everything
they
could
find
sawn
wood
for
their
was
especially
desirable
and
they
took
all
that
had
been
prepared
for
the
usual
wants
of
the
river
having
helped
themselves
to
this
and
such
other
chattels
as
were
at
the
moment
needed
and
at
hand
they
went
on
their
way
grimly
rejoicing
on
the
following
day
most
of
them
returned
some
without
arms
some
without
legs
some
even
without
heads
a
wretched
wounded
mutilated
body
of
filibusters
the
boiler
of
their
large
steamer
had
burst
scattering
destruction
far
and
near
it
was
current
among
the
filibusters
that
the
logs
of
wood
had
been
laden
with
gunpowder
in
order
to
effect
this
damage
it
is
more
probable
that
being
filibusters
rough
and
ready
as
the
phrase
goes
they
had
not
duly
looked
to
their
engineering
properties
at
any
rate
they
all
returned
on
the
whole
these
filibusters
have
suffered
dire
punishment
for
their
sins
at
any
rate
the
merchant
under
whose
roof
we
slept
received
no
payment
for
his
wood
here
we
found
two
men
living
not
in
such
squalid
misery
as
that
independent
german
but
nevertheless
sufficiently
isolated
from
the
world
one
was
an
old
swedish
sailor
who
seemed
to
speak
every
language
under
the
sun
and
to
have
been
in
every
portion
of
the
globe
whether
under
the
sun
or
otherwise
at
any
rate
we
could
not
induce
him
to
own
to
not
having
been
in
any
place
timbuctoo
yes
indeed
he
had
unfortunately
been
a
captive
there
for
three
years
at
mecca
he
had
passed
as
an
arab
among
the
arabs
having
made
the
great
pilgrimage
in
company
with
many
children
of
mahomet
wearing
the
green
turban
as
a
veritable
child
of
mahomet
himself
portsmouth
he
knew
well
having
had
many
a
row
about
the
head
we
could
not
catch
him
tripping
though
we
put
him
through
his
facings
to
the
best
of
our
joint
geographical
knowledge
at
present
he
was
a
poor
gardener
on
the
san
juan
river
having
begun
life
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
swedish
navy
had
seen
too
much
of
the
world
to
refuse
the
dollar
which
was
offered
to
him
on
the
next
morning
we
reached
greytown
following
the
san
juan
river
down
to
that
pleasant
place
there
is
another
passage
out
to
the
sea
by
the
colorado
a
branch
river
which
striking
out
from
the
san
juan
runs
into
the
ocean
by
a
shorter
channel
this
also
has
been
thought
of
as
a
course
for
the
projected
canal
preferable
to
that
of
the
san
juan
i
believe
them
to
be
equally
impracticable
the
san
juan
river
itself
is
so
shallow
that
we
were
frequently
on
the
ground
even
in
our
light
canoe
and
what
shall
i
say
of
greytown
we
have
a
there
or
at
least
had
one
when
these
pages
were
written
a
whose
duty
it
is
or
was
to
have
under
his
special
care
the
king
of
mosquitia
as
some
people
are
pleased
to
call
this
coast
of
the
mosquito
coast
as
it
is
generally
styled
bluefields
further
along
the
coast
is
the
chosen
residence
of
this
sable
tyrant
but
greytown
is
the
capital
of
his
dominions
now
it
is
believed
that
in
deference
to
the
feelings
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
american
reading
of
the
treaty
and
in
deference
i
may
add
to
a
very
sensible
consideration
that
the
matter
is
of
no
possible
moment
to
ourselves
the
protectorate
of
the
mosquito
coast
is
to
be
abandoned
what
the
king
will
do
i
can
not
imagine
but
it
will
be
a
happy
day
i
should
think
for
our
consul
when
he
is
removed
from
greytown
of
all
the
places
in
which
i
have
ever
put
my
foot
i
think
that
is
the
most
wretched
it
is
a
small
town
perhaps
of
two
thousand
inhabitants
though
this
on
my
part
is
a
mere
guess
at
the
mouth
of
the
san
juan
and
surrounded
on
every
side
either
by
water
or
impassable
forests
a
walk
of
a
mile
in
any
direction
would
be
impossible
unless
along
the
beach
of
the
sea
but
this
is
of
less
importance
as
the
continual
heat
would
prevent
any
one
from
thinking
of
such
exercise
sundry
americans
live
here
worshipping
the
almighty
dollar
as
americans
do
keeping
liquor
shops
and
warehouses
and
with
the
americans
sundry
englishmen
and
sundry
germans
of
the
female
population
i
saw
nothing
except
some
negro
women
and
one
white
or
rather
owner
of
a
rum
shop
the
native
population
are
the
mosquito
indians
but
it
seems
that
they
are
hardly
allowed
to
live
in
greytown
they
are
to
be
seen
paddling
about
in
their
canoes
selling
a
few
eggs
and
chickens
catching
turtle
and
not
rarely
getting
drunk
they
would
seem
from
their
colour
and
physiognomy
to
be
a
cross
between
the
negro
and
the
indian
and
such
i
imagine
to
be
the
case
they
have
a
language
of
their
own
but
those
on
the
coast
almost
always
speak
english
also
my
gallant
young
friend
fitzm
was
in
command
of
a
small
schooner
inside
the
harbour
of
greytown
as
the
accommodation
of
the
city
itself
was
not
inviting
i
gladly
took
up
my
quarters
under
his
flag
until
the
english
packet
which
was
then
hourly
expected
should
be
ready
to
carry
me
to
colon
and
thomas
i
can
only
say
that
if
i
was
commander
of
that
schooner
i
would
lie
outside
the
harbour
so
as
to
be
beyond
the
of
those
frightful
musquitoes
the
country
has
been
well
named
mosquitia
there
was
an
american
and
also
an
english
both
i
believe
technically
lying
off
greytown
and
we
dined
on
board
them
both
on
two
consecutive
days
of
the
american
i
will
say
speaking
in
their
praise
that
i
never
ate
such
bacon
and
peas
it
may
be
that
the
old
hens
up
the
serapiqui
river
had
rendered
me
peculiarly
susceptible
to
such
delights
but
nevertheless
i
shall
always
think
that
there
was
something
peculiar
about
the
bacon
and
peas
on
board
the
american
louis
and
on
the
second
day
the
steamer
came
in
the
captain
moir
we
then
dined
on
board
of
her
and
on
the
same
night
she
sailed
for
colon
and
when
shall
i
see
that
gallant
young
lieutenant
again
putting
aside
his
unjust
and
i
must
say
miraculous
consumption
of
eggs
i
could
hardly
wish
for
a
better

chapter

central

railways
canals
and
transit
how
best
to
get
about
this
world
which
god
has
given
us
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
subjects
which
men
have
to
consider
and
one
of
the
most
interesting
works
on
which
men
can
employ
themselves
the
child
when
born
is
first
suckled
then
fed
with
a
spoon
in
his
next
stage
his
food
is
cut
up
for
him
and
he
begins
to
help
himself
for
some
years
after
that
it
is
still
carved
under
parental
authority
and
then
at
last
he
sits
down
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
own
leg
of
mutton
under
his
own
auspices
our
development
in
travelling
has
been
much
of
the
same
sort
and
we
are
now
perhaps
beginning
to
use
our
own
knife
and
fork
though
we
hardly
yet
understand
the
science
of
carving
or
at
any
rate
can
hardly
bring
our
hands
to
the
duly
dexterous
use
of
the
necessary
tools
we
have
at
least
got
so
far
as
this
that
we
perceive
that
the
leg
of
mutton
is
to
be
cooked
and
carved
we
are
not
to
eat
hunks
of
raw
sheep
cut
off
here
and
there
the
meat
to
suit
our
palates
should
be
put
on
a
plate
in
the
guise
of
a
cleanly
slice
cut
to
a
certain
thickness
and
not
exceeding
a
certain
size
and
we
have
also
got
so
far
as
this
that
we
know
that
the
world
must
be
traversed
by
certain
routes
prepared
for
us
originally
not
by
ourselves
but
by
the
hand
of
god
we
were
great
heroes
when
we
first
got
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
when
we
first
crossed
the
atlantic
when
we
first
doubled
cape
horn
we
were
then
learning
to
pick
up
our
crumbs
with
our
earliest
knives
and
forks
and
there
was
considerable
peril
in
the
attempt
we
have
got
beyond
that
now
and
have
perceived
that
we
may
traverse
the
world
without
going
round
it
the
road
from
europe
to
asia
is
by
egypt
and
the
isthmus
of
suez
not
by
the
cape
of
good
hope
so
also
is
the
road
from
europe
to
the
west
of
america
and
from
the
east
of
america
to
asia
by
the
isthmus
of
central
america
and
not
by
cape
horn
we
have
found
out
this
and
have
i
presume
found
out
also
that
this
was
all
laid
out
for
us
by
the
hands
of
the
creator
prepared
exactly
as
the
sheep
have
been
prepared
it
has
been
only
necessary
that
we
should
learn
to
use
the
good
things
given
us
that
there
are
reasons
why
the
way
should
not
have
been
made
absolutely
open
we
may
well
suppose
though
we
can
not
perhaps
at
present
well
understand
how
currents
of
the
sea
might
have
run
so
as
to
have
impeded
rather
than
have
assisted
navigation
had
the
two
americas
been
disjoined
how
pernicious
winds
might
have
blown
and
injurious
waters
have
flowed
had
the
red
sea
opened
into
the
mediterranean
we
may
imagine
though
we
can
not
know
that
the
world
surface
as
formed
by
god
is
best
for
god
purposes
and
therefore
certainly
best
for
man
purposes
that
most
of
us
must
believe
but
it
is
for
us
to
carve
the
good
things
which
are
put
before
us
and
to
find
out
the
best
way
in
which
they
may
be
carved
we
may
perhaps
fairly
think
that
we
have
done
much
towards
acquiring
this
knowledge
but
we
certainly
know
that
there
is
more
yet
to
be
done
we
have
lines
of
railways
from
london
to
manchester
from
calais
across
france
and
all
the
germanies
to
eastern
europe
from
the
coast
of
maine
through
the
canadas
to
the
central
territories
of
the
united
states
but
there
are
no
lines
yet
from
new
york
to
california
nor
from
the
coast
of
the
levant
to
bombay
and
calcutta
but
perhaps
the
two
greatest
points
which
are
at
this
moment
being
mooted
with
reference
to
the
carriage
about
the
world
of
mankind
and
man
goods
concern
the
mode
in
which
we
may
most
advantageously
pass
across
the
isthmuses
of
suez
and
panama
these
are
the
two
land
obstacles
in
the
way
of
navigation
of
direct
water
carriage
round
the
earth
belt
obstacles
as
they
appear
to
us
though
in
truth
so
probably
locks
formed
by
the
almighty
for
the
assistance
of
our
navigation
for
many
years
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
many
but
for
some
few
centuries
as
regards
panama
and
for
many
centuries
as
regards
suez
this
necessity
has
been
felt
and
the
minds
of
men
in
those
elder
days
inclined
naturally
to
canals
in
the
days
of
the
old
kings
of
egypt
antecedent
to
cleopatra
attempts
were
made
to
cut
through
the
sands
and
shallow
lakes
from
the
eastern
margin
of
the
nile
delta
to
the
red
sea
and
the
idea
of
piercing
central
america
in
some
point
occurred
to
the
spaniards
immediately
on
their
discovering
the
relative
position
of
the
two
oceans
but
in
those
days
men
were
infants
not
as
yet
trusted
with
the
the
work
which
unsuccessfully
filled
the
brains
of
so
many
thoughtful
men
for
so
many
years
has
now
been
done
at
any
rate
to
a
degree
railways
have
been
completed
from
alexandria
on
the
mediterranean
to
suez
on
the
red
sea
and
from
panama
on
the
pacific
to
aspinwall
or
colon
on
the
caribbean
sea
these
railways
are
now
at
work
and
passengers
are
carried
across
with
sufficient
rapidity
the
isthmus
of
suez
over
which
the
line
of
railway
runs
for
something
over
two
hundred
miles
creates
a
total
delay
to
our
indian
mails
and
passengers
of
hours
only
and
the
lesser
distance
of
the
american
isthmus
is
traversed
in
three
hours
were
rapidity
here
as
necessary
as
it
is
in
the
other
case
and
it
will
doubtless
become
so
the
conveyance
from
one
sea
to
the
other
need
not
create
a
delay
of
above
twelve
hours
but
not
the
less
are
many
men
good
and
scientific
men
too
keenly
impressed
with
the
idea
that
the
two
isthmuses
should
be
pierced
with
canals
although
these
railways
are
at
work
all
mankind
has
heard
much
of
lesseps
and
his
suez
canal
on
that
matter
i
do
not
mean
to
say
much
here
i
have
a
very
strong
opinion
that
such
canal
will
not
and
can
not
be
made
that
all
the
strength
of
the
arguments
adduced
in
the
matter
are
hostile
to
it
and
that
steam
navigation
by
land
will
and
ought
to
be
the
means
of
transit
through
egypt
but
that
matter
is
a
long
way
distant
from
our
present
subject
it
is
with
reference
to
the
transit
over
the
other
isthmus
that
i
propose
to
say
a
few
words
it
is
singular
or
perhaps
if
rightly
considered
not
singular
that
both
the
railways
have
been
constructed
mainly
by
science
and
energy
and
under
the
pressure
of
influence
while
both
the
canal
schemes
most
prevalent
at
the
present
day
owe
their
repute
to
french
eloquence
and
french
enthusiasm
lesseps
is
the
patron
of
the
suez
canal
and
belly
of
that
which
is
or
is
not
to
be
constructed
from
san
juan
del
norte
or
greytown
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
there
are
three
proposed
methods
of
crossing
the
isthmus
that
by
railway
that
by
canal
and
a
third
by
the
ordinary
use
of
such
ordinary
means
of
conveyance
as
the
land
and
the
waters
of
the
country
afford
as
regards
railway
passage
one
line
being
now
open
and
at
work
has
those
nine
points
in
its
favour
which
possession
gives
it
does
convey
men
and
goods
across
with
great
rapidity
and
is
a
reality
doing
that
which
it
pretends
to
do
its
charges
however
are
very
high
and
it
would
doubtless
be
well
if
competition
or
fear
of
competition
could
be
made
to
lower
them
five
pound
is
charged
for
conveying
a
passenger
less
than
fifty
miles
no
class
of
passengers
can
cross
at
a
cheaper
fare
and
the
rates
charged
for
goods
are
as
high
in
comparison
on
the
other
side
it
may
be
said
that
the
project
was
one
of
great
risk
that
the
line
was
from
its
circumstances
very
costly
having
been
made
at
an
expense
of
about
thousand
pounds
a
mile
i
believe
however
that
a
considerable
portion
of
the
london
and
birmingham
line
was
equally
expensive
and
that
trains
by
which
money
can
be
made
can
not
run
often
perhaps
only
six
or
seven
times
a
month
each
way
it
is
however
very
desirous
that
the
fares
should
be
lowered
and
the
great
profits
accruing
to
the
railway
prove
that
this
may
be
done
eventually
they
doubtless
will
be
lowered
the
only
other
line
of
railway
which
now
seems
to
be
spoken
of
as
practicable
for
the
passage
of
the
isthmus
is
one
the
construction
of
which
has
been
proposed
across
the
republic
of
honduras
from
a
spot
called
port
cortez
in
the
bay
of
honduras
on
the
northern
or
atlantic
side
to
some
harbour
to
be
chosen
in
the
bay
of
fonseca
on
the
southern
or
pacific
side
squier
who
was
chargé
from
the
united
states
to
central
america
and
whose
work
on
the
republics
of
central
america
is
well
known
strongly
advocates
this
line
showing
in
the
first
place
that
from
its
position
it
would
suit
the
traffic
of
the
united
states
much
better
than
that
of
panama
as
undoubtedly
it
would
seeing
that
the
transit
from
new
york
to
california
viâ
panama
must
go
down
south
as
far
as
latitude
north
whereas
by
the
proposed
route
through
honduras
it
need
not
descend
below
lat
north
thus
saving
double
that
distance
in
the
total
run
each
way
squier
then
goes
on
to
prove
that
the
country
of
honduras
is
in
every
way
suited
for
the
purposes
of
a
railway
but
here
i
am
not
sure
that
he
carries
me
with
him
the
road
would
have
to
ascend
nearly
three
thousand
feet
above
the
and
though
it
may
be
true
that
the
grades
themselves
would
not
be
more
severe
than
many
that
are
now
to
be
found
on
railways
in
full
work
in
other
countries
nevertheless
it
must
be
felt
that
the
overcoming
such
an
altitude
in
such
a
country
and
the
working
over
it
when
overcome
would
necessarily
add
greatly
to
the
original
cost
of
the
line
and
the
subsequent
cost
of
running
the
panama
line
goes
through
a
country
comparatively
level
then
the
distance
across
honduras
is
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
it
is
computed
that
the
line
would
be
two
hundred
miles
the
length
of
the
panama
line
is
or
miles
that
we
may
take
all
that
squier
says
on
this
subject
as
proved
his
proposed
route
for
the
traffic
of
the
united
states
is
from
the
western
coast
of
florida
to
the
chosen
port
port
cortez
in
honduras
and
he
attempts
to
show
that
this
is
pretty
nearly
the
only
possible
passage
in
those
seas
free
from
hurricanes
and
danger
but
this
passage
is
right
across
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
vessels
would
have
to
stem
the
full
force
of
the
on
their
passage
down
from
florida
in
all
such
matters
where
a
man
becomes
warm
on
a
scheme
he
feels
himself
compelled
to
prove
that
the
gods
themselves
have
pointed
out
the
plan
as
the
only
one
fit
for
adoption
as
the
only
one
free
from
all
evil
and
blessed
with
every
advantage
we
are
always
our
points
the
enormous
cost
of
the
panama
line
arose
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
the
necessary
sort
of
labour
the
natives
would
not
work
as
they
were
wanted
and
europeans
died
there
so
that
at
last
labour
was
imported
from
the
coast
of
new
granada
at
the
high
level
named
as
the
summit
of
the
honduras
route
the
climate
would
no
doubt
be
comparatively
mild
and
labour
easy
to
be
borne
but
near
the
coast
of
the
bays
both
of
honduras
and
fonseca
the
heat
would
be
as
great
as
at
aspinwall
and
panama
and
the
effects
probably
the
same
as
regards
our
british
traffic
the
route
by
the
isthmus
of
panama
is
the
better
situated
of
the
two
looking
at
a
map
of
the
world
and
it
is
necessary
to
take
in
the
whole
world
in
order
that
the
courses
of
british
trade
may
be
seen
it
does
not
seem
to
be
of
much
consequence
as
regards
distance
whether
a
bale
of
goods
from
london
to
sydney
should
pass
the
isthmus
by
honduras
or
panama
but
in
fact
even
for
this
route
the
former
would
labour
under
great
disadvantages
a
ship
in
making
its
way
from
honduras
up
to
jamaica
has
to
fight
against
the
trade
winds
on
this
account
our
mail
steamer
from
belize
to
jamaica
is
timed
only
at
four
miles
an
hour
though
the
mail
to
honduras
is
timed
at
eight
miles
an
hour
this
would
be
the
direct
route
from
the
terminus
of
the
honduras
line
to
europe
and
matters
would
be
made
only
worse
if
any
other
line
were
taken
but
the
track
from
panama
to
jamaica
is
subject
to
what
sailors
call
a
soldier
wind
even
working
to
thomas
and
thereby
getting
a
stronger
slant
of
the
trade
winds
against
them
our
mail
steamers
can
make
eight
or
nine
miles
an
hour
as
regards
our
trade
to
chili
and
peru
it
is
clear
that
honduras
is
altogether
out
of
our
way
and
as
regards
our
coming
trade
to
frazer
river
and
vancouver
island
though
the
absolute
distance
via
honduras
would
be
something
shorter
that
benefit
would
be
neutralized
by
the
disadvantageous
position
of
the
bay
of
honduras
as
above
explained
but
the
great
advantage
which
the
panama
line
enjoys
is
the
fact
of
its
being
already
made
has
the
nine
points
which
possession
gives
its
miles
cost
one
million
six
hundred
thousand
pounds
it
can
not
be
presumed
that
two
hundred
miles
through
honduras
could
be
made
for
double
that
sum
and
seeing
that
the
honduras
line
would
be
in
opposition
to
the
other
and
only
be
used
if
running
at
fares
lower
than
those
of
its
rival
i
can
not
see
how
it
would
pay
or
where
the
money
is
to
be
procured
i
am
not
aware
that
the
absolute
cost
of
the
proposed
line
through
honduras
has
been
accurately
computed
as
regards
the
public
interest
two
lines
would
no
doubt
be
better
than
one
competition
is
always
beneficial
to
the
consumer
but
in
this
case
i
do
not
expect
to
see
the
second
line
made
in
our
days
that
there
will
in
future
days
be
a
dozen
ways
of
commodiously
crossing
the
isthmus
when
we
have
thoroughly
learned
how
best
to
carve
our
leg
of
mutton
i
do
not
at
all
doubt
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
here
that
england
is
bound
by
a
treaty
with
honduras
made
in
to
assist
in
furthering
the
execution
of
this
work
by
our
countenance
aid
and
protection
on
condition
that
when
made
we
britishers
are
to
have
the
full
use
of
it
as
much
so
at
least
as
any
other
people
or
nation
and
that
as
i
take
it
is
the
sole
and
only
meaning
of
all
those
treaties
made
on
our
behalf
with
central
america
or
in
respect
to
central
america
treaty
new
ouseley
treaty
and
others
namely
that
we
who
are
desirous
of
excluding
no
person
from
the
benefits
of
this
public
are
not
ourselves
to
be
excluded
on
any
consideration
whatever
and
may
we
not
boast
that
this
is
the
only
object
looked
for
in
all
our
treaties
and
diplomatic
doings
is
it
not
for
that
reason
that
we
hold
gibraltar
are
jealous
about
egypt
and
resolved
to
have
perim
in
our
power
is
it
not
true
that
we
would
fain
make
all
ways
open
to
all
men
that
we
would
have
them
open
to
ourselves
certainly
but
not
closed
against
any
human
being
if
that
and
such
like
be
not
what
our
diplomatists
are
doing
then
i
for
one
misunderstand
their
trade
so
much
for
the
two
railways
and
now
as
to
the
proposed
canals
here
no
happy
undertaking
can
boast
of
the
joys
of
possession
no
canal
is
as
yet
open
carrying
men
and
goods
with
shall
we
say
per
cent
profit
on
the
outlay
ah
that
is
an
elysium
which
does
not
readily
repeat
itself
oh
thou
thrice
happy
colonel
totten
who
hast
constructed
a
railway
resulting
in
such
celestial
beatitude
the
name
of
canals
projected
across
the
isthmus
has
been
legion
and
the
merits
of
them
all
have
in
their
time
been
hotly
pressed
by
their
special
advocates
that
most
to
the
north
which
was
the
passage
selected
by
cortes
and
pressed
by
him
on
the
spanish
government
would
pass
through
mexico
the
line
would
be
from
the
gulf
of
campechay
up
the
river
coatzacoalcoz
to
tehuantepec
on
the
pacific
this
was
advocated
as
lately
as
but
has
now
i
believe
been
abandoned
as
impracticable
going
south
down
the
map
the
next
proposition
of
which
i
can
find
mention
is
for
a
canal
from
the
head
of
the
lake
of
dulce
through
the
state
of
guatemala
the
lake
or
gulf
of
dulce
being
at
the
head
of
the
gulf
of
honduras
this
also
seems
to
have
been
abandoned
then
we
come
to
the
proposed
honduras
railway
of
which
mention
has
been
made
next
below
this
we
reach
a
cluster
of
canals
all
going
through
the
great
inland
lake
of
nicaragua
this
scheme
or
one
of
these
schemes
has
also
been
in
existence
since
the
times
of
the
early
spaniards
and
has
been
adhered
to
with
more
or
less
pertinacity
ever
since
this
lake
of
nicaragua
was
to
be
reached
either
direct
by
the
river
san
juan
or
by
entering
the
river
san
juan
from
the
ocean
by
the
river
colorado
which
is
in
effect
a
branch
of
the
san
juan
the
projected
canal
would
thus
ascend
to
the
lake
from
thence
to
the
pacific
various
passages
for
egress
have
been
suggested
at
first
it
was
intended
naturally
to
get
out
at
the
nearest
practicable
point
that
being
probably
at
san
juan
del
sur
they
have
san
juans
and
san
josés
quite
at
pleasure
about
these
countries
then
came
the
grand
plan
of
the
present
french
emperor
bearing
at
least
his
name
and
first
published
i
think
in
this
was
a
very
grand
plan
of
course
the
route
of
transit
was
to
be
right
up
the
lake
of
nicaragua
to
its
northern
point
there
the
canal
was
to
enter
the
river
tipitapa
and
come
out
again
in
the
northern
lake
of
managua
from
thence
it
was
to
be
taken
out
to
the
pacific
at
the
port
of
realejo
this
project
included
the
building
of
an
enormous
city
which
was
to
contain
the
wealth
of
the
new
world
and
to
be
as
it
were
a
new
constantinople
between
the
two
lakes
but
the
scheme
has
been
abandoned
as
being
too
costly
too
imperial
and
now
we
have
belly
scheme
his
scheme
and
pamphlet
of
which
i
will
say
a
few
words
just
now
and
therefore
i
pass
on
to
the
others
the
line
of
the
river
chargres
and
from
thence
to
the
town
of
panama
being
very
nearly
the
line
of
the
present
railway
was
long
contemplated
with
favour
but
has
now
been
abandoned
as
impracticable
as
has
also
the
line
over
the
isthmus
of
darien
which
was
for
a
while
thought
to
be
the
most
feasible
as
being
the
shortest
the
lie
of
the
land
however
and
the
nature
of
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
have
put
this
scheme
altogether
out
of
the
question
next
and
last
is
the
course
of
the
river
atrato
which
runs
into
the
gulf
of
darien
but
which
is
in
fact
the
first
of
the
great
rivers
of
south
america
first
that
is
counting
them
as
commencing
from
the
isthmus
it
runs
down
from
the
andes
parallel
to
the
coast
of
the
pacific
and
is
navigable
for
many
miles
the
necessary
surveys
however
for
connecting
this
river
with
the
pacific
have
never
yet
been
made
and
even
if
this
plan
were
practicable
the
extremely
low
latitude
at
which
the
pacific
ocean
would
be
reached
would
make
such
a
line
bad
for
our
trade
and
quite
out
of
the
question
for
the
chief
portion
of
the
american
transit
it
appears
therefore
that
there
are
insuperable
objections
to
all
these
canal
routes
unless
it
be
to
some
route
passing
through
the
lake
of
nicaragua
by
reference
to
a
map
of
central
america
it
will
be
seen
that
the
waters
of
this
lake
joined
to
those
of
the
san
juan
river
comprise
the
breadth
of
nearly
the
whole
isthmus
leaving
a
distance
not
exceeding
twenty
miles
to
be
conquered
by
a
canal
at
first
sight
this
appears
to
be
very
enticing
and
belly
has
been
enticed
he
has
been
enticed
or
at
any
rate
writes
as
though
this
were
the
case
anything
worded
more
eloquently
energetically
and
grandiloquently
than
his
pamphlet
in
favour
of
this
route
i
have
not
met
even
among
french
pamphlets
felix
belly
describes
himself
as
a
publiciste
and
chevalier
of
the
order
of
saint
maurice
and
lazarus
and
of
the
order
of
medjidie
as
such
he
has
made
a
convention
with
don
thomas
martinez
president
of
the
republic
of
nicaragua
and
with
don
juan
rafael
mora
president
of
the
republic
of
costa
rica
in
accordance
with
which
he
chevalier
belly
is
to
cut
a
canal
or
for
ships
through
the
territories
of
those
potentates
obtaining
thereby
certain
vast
privileges
including
the
possession
of
no
small
portion
of
those
territories
and
the
right
of
levying
all
manner
of
tolls
on
the
world
commerce
which
is
to
pass
through
his
canal
and
the
potentates
above
named
are
in
return
to
receive
from
belly
very
considerable
subsidies
out
of
these
tolls
they
bind
themselves
moreover
to
permit
no
other
traffic
or
transit
through
their
country
securing
to
belly
for
years
the
monopoly
of
the
job
and
granting
to
him
the
great
diplomatic
privilege
of
constituting
his
canal
let
it
be
here
or
there
the
boundary
of
the
realms
of
these
two
potentates
what
strikes
me
with
the
greatest
wonder
on
reading
not
the
pamphlet
for
that
is
perhaps
more
wonderful
in
other
respects
but
the
articles
of
the
convention
is
that
these
three
persons
the
potentates
aforesaid
and
the
chevalier
should
have
among
them
the
power
of
doing
all
this
or
that
they
should
even
have
had
the
power
of
agreeing
to
do
all
this
for
really
up
to
this
period
one
seems
hardly
to
have
heard
in
england
much
about
any
one
of
them
that
there
should
be
presidents
of
these
two
republics
is
supposed
as
there
are
also
doubtless
of
san
salvador
and
venezuela
and
all
the
other
western
republics
but
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
as
presidents
of
republics
they
can
have
themselves
no
more
power
to
give
away
a
years
possession
of
their
lands
and
waters
than
can
any
other
citizen
buchanan
could
hardly
sell
to
any
englishman
however
enterprising
the
right
of
making
a
railway
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
the
convention
does
certainly
bear
two
other
signatures
which
purport
to
be
those
of
the
ministers
of
foreign
affairs
attached
to
those
two
republics
but
even
this
hardly
seems
to
give
us
a
sufficient
guarantee
of
power
what
if
we
should
put
our
money
into
the
canal
and
future
presidents
should
refuse
to
be
bound
by
the
agreement
but
belly
name
stands
on
his
side
alone
no
foreign
minister
or
is
necessary
to
back
his
signature
the
two
potentates
having
agreed
to
give
the
country
he
will
agree
to
make
the
canal
he
belly
publiciste
and
chevalier
it
is
to
cost
altogether
according
to
his
account
francs
say
four
million
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
sterling
of
a
company
chairman
and
directors
we
hear
nothing
we
can
not
find
that
the
shares
are
in
the
market
probably
they
may
be
too
valuable
on
our
own
stock
exchange
the
matter
does
not
seem
to
be
much
known
nor
do
we
perceive
that
it
is
quoted
among
french
prices
nevertheless
belly
has
the
four
million
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
already
in
his
and
he
will
make
the
canal
i
wonder
whether
he
would
drain
london
for
us
if
we
were
to
ask
him
but
wonderful
as
is
the
fact
that
these
three
gentlemen
should
be
about
to
accomplish
this
magnificent
undertaking
for
the
world
the
eloquence
of
the
language
in
which
the
undertaking
is
described
is
perhaps
more
wonderful
still
on
the
first
of
may
at
rivas
in
nicaragua
in
the
midst
of
a
concourse
of
circumstances
full
of
grandeur
a
convention
was
signed
which
opens
to
civilization
a
new
view
and
unlimited
horizons
the
hour
has
come
for
commencing
with
resolution
this
enterprise
of
cutting
the
isthmus
of
panama
the
solution
of
the
problem
must
be
no
longer
retarded
it
belongs
to
an
epoch
which
has
given
to
itself
the
mission
of
pulling
down
barriers
and
suppressing
distances
it
must
be
regarded
not
as
a
private
speculation
but
as
a
creation
of
public
interest
not
as
the
work
of
this
people
or
that
party
but
as
springing
from
civilization
itself
then
belly
goes
on
to
say
that
this
project
emanating
from
a
man
sympathetic
with
the
cause
and
a
witness
of
the
heroism
of
central
america
namely
himself
possesses
advantages
which
of
course
could
not
attach
to
any
scheme
devised
by
a
less
godlike
being
it
may
be
seen
that
i
have
no
great
belief
in
the
scheme
of
belly
neither
have
i
in
many
other
schemes
of
the
present
day
emanating
from
englishmen
americans
and
others
but
it
is
not
that
disbelief
but
my
admiration
for
french
eloquence
which
urges
me
to
make
the
above
translation
alas
i
feel
that
i
have
lost
so
much
of
the
gallic
fragrance
the
parisian
aroma
has
escaped
from
the
poor
english
words
is
not
this
peculiar
eloquence
used
in
propagating
all
french
projects
for
increased
civilization
from
the
invention
of
a
new
constitution
to
that
of
a
new
shirt
is
it
even
wanting
we
with
our
stupid
unimaginative
platitudes
know
no
better
than
to
write
up
eureka
when
we
think
we
have
discovered
anything
but
a
frenchman
tells
his
countrymen
that
they
need
no
longer
be
mortals
a
new
era
has
come
let
them
wear
his
slippers
and
they
will
walk
as
gods
walk
how
many
new
eras
have
there
not
been
who
is
not
sick
of
the
grandiloquence
of
french
progress
now
now
we
have
taken
the
one
great
step
the
dove
at
length
may
nestle
with
the
kite
the
lamb
drink
with
the
wolf
men
may
share
their
goods
certain
that
others
will
share
with
them
labour
and
wages
work
and
its
reward
shall
be
systematized
now
we
have
done
it
and
the
world
shall
be
happy
well
perhaps
the
french
world
is
happy
it
may
be
that
the
liberty
which
they
have
propagated
the
equality
which
they
enjoy
and
the
fraternity
which
they
practise
is
fit
for
them
but
when
has
truly
mighty
work
been
heralded
by
magniloquence
did
we
have
any
grand
words
from
old
george
stephenson
with
his
vera
awkward
for
the
cou
was
there
aught
of
the
eloquent
sententiousness
of
a
french
marshal
about
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
was
luther
apt
to
speak
with
great
phraseology
if
words
ever
convey
to
my
ears
a
positive
contradiction
of
the
assertion
which
they
affect
to
make
it
is
when
they
are
grandly
antithetical
and
magnificently
verbose
if
in
addition
to
this
they
promise
to
mankind
new
epochs
new
views
and
unlimited
horizons
surely
no
further
proof
can
be
needed
that
they
are
vain
empty
and
untrue
but
the
language
in
which
this
proposal
for
a
canal
is
couched
is
hardly
worth
so
much
consideration
would
be
worth
no
consideration
at
all
did
it
not
come
before
us
now
as
an
emblem
of
that
which
at
this
present
time
is
the
most
pernicious
point
in
the
french
character
a
false
boasting
of
truth
and
honesty
with
little
or
no
relish
for
true
truth
and
true
honesty
the
present
question
is
whether
belly
canal
scheme
be
feasible
and
if
feasible
whether
he
has
or
can
attain
the
means
of
carrying
it
out
in
the
first
place
it
has
already
come
to
pass
that
the
convention
signed
with
such
unlimited
horizons
has
proved
to
be
powerless
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
it
was
agreed
to
by
the
two
presidents
and
as
far
as
one
of
them
is
concerned
it
is
i
fear
a
fact
also
that
for
the
present
he
has
sufficient
power
in
his
own
territory
to
bind
his
countrymen
at
any
rate
for
a
time
by
his
unsupported
signature
don
juan
rafael
mora
in
costa
rica
need
care
for
no
congress
if
he
were
called
dictator
instead
of
president
the
change
would
only
be
in
the
word
but
this
is
not
exactly
so
in
nicaragua
there
it
seems
the
congress
has
refused
to
ratify
the
treaty
as
originally
made
but
they
have
i
believe
ratified
another
in
which
undertaking
to
make
the
canal
is
the
same
as
before
but
from
which
the
enormous
grant
of
land
and
the
stipulations
as
to
the
boundary
line
of
the
territories
are
excluded
in
belly
pamphlet
he
publishes
a
letter
which
he
has
received
from
lord
malmesbury
as
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
or
rather
a
french
translation
of
such
a
letter
it
is
this
letter
which
appears
to
have
given
in
central
america
the
strongest
guarantee
that
something
is
truly
intended
by
belly
project
both
in
the
pamphlet
and
in
the
convention
itself
repeated
reference
is
made
to
the
french
government
but
no
document
is
given
nor
even
is
any
positive
assertion
made
that
the
government
of
the
emperor
in
any
way
recognizes
the
scheme
but
if
this
letter
be
true
and
truly
translated
lord
malmesbury
has
done
so
to
a
certain
extent
and
i
am
happy
says
the
letter
to
be
able
to
assure
you
that
the
stipulations
of
the
treaty
made
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
commonly
called
the
treaty
are
in
my
opinion
applicable
to
your
project
if
you
put
it
in
execution
and
then
this
letter
written
to
a
private
gentleman
holding
no
official
position
is
signed
by
the
secretary
of
state
himself
belly
holds
no
official
position
but
he
is
addressed
in
his
translation
of
lord
malmesbury
letter
as
concessionnaire
du
canal
de
nicaragua
note
to
page
edition
i
have
not
happened
to
meet
with
any
earlier
edition
of
the
work
such
a
letter
from
such
a
quarter
has
certainly
been
very
useful
to
belly
in
the
minds
of
the
presidents
of
the
republics
of
central
america
it
must
have
gone
far
to
prove
that
england
at
any
rate
regards
belly
as
no
adventurer
there
are
many
of
the
clauses
of
the
convention
to
which
i
should
have
imagined
that
the
english
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
would
not
have
given
an
assent
although
he
might
not
be
called
on
to
express
dissent
in
the
article
it
is
stipulated
that
during
the
making
of
the
canal
which
if
it
were
to
be
made
at
all
would
be
protracted
over
many
years
two
french
ships
of
war
should
lie
in
the
lake
of
nicaragua
it
having
been
stipulated
by
art
that
no
other
ships
of
war
should
be
admitted
thus
giving
to
france
a
military
occupation
of
the
country
and
by
art
it
is
agreed
that
any
political
squabble
relative
to
this
convention
should
be
referred
to
a
tribunal
of
seven
two
to
be
named
by
the
company
and
one
each
by
france
england
the
united
states
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
it
is
i
imagine
hardly
probable
that
the
english
government
would
send
one
member
to
such
a
tribunal
in
which
france
would
have
three
voices
to
her
one
two
of
which
voices
would
be
wholly
irresponsible
of
course
the
letter
does
not
bind
lord
malmesbury
or
any
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
to
the
different
articles
of
the
convention
but
if
it
be
a
genuine
letter
i
can
not
but
think
it
to
have
been
imprudent
belly
speaks
of
his
convention
as
having
been
adopted
by
france
england
and
the
united
states
adopted
as
it
already
is
by
the
united
states
by
england
and
by
france
and
as
it
soon
will
be
by
the
contracting
powers
of
the
treaty
of
paris
it
will
become
the
saviour
of
the
world
what
basis
there
is
for
this
statement
as
regards
france
and
the
united
states
i
do
not
know
as
regards
england
i
presume
lord
malmesbury
letter
affords
that
basis
the
assistance
of
lord
malmesbury
has
been
obtained
by
the
easy
progress
of
addressing
a
letter
to
him
but
to
seduce
the
presidents
of
central
america
a
greater
effort
has
been
made
they
are
told
that
they
are
the
wisest
of
the
earth
potentates
carrera
of
guatemala
though
an
indian
and
uneducated
is
a
man
of
natural
genius
and
has
governed
for
fifteen
years
with
a
wisdom
which
has
attracted
to
him
the
unanimous
adherence
of
his
colleagues
don
juan
mora
of
costa
rica
the
hero
of
rivas
has
not
had
to
spill
a
drop
of
blood
in
maintaining
in
his
cities
an
order
much
more
perfect
than
any
to
be
found
in
europe
he
is
a
man
de
ligne
altogether
out
of
the
common
and
although
he
counts
scarcely
forty
years
but
few
political
examples
of
old
europe
can
be
compared
to
him
and
as
for
general
martinez
president
of
nicaragua
since
he
has
arrived
at
the
direction
of
affairs
there
he
would
have
healed
all
the
wounds
of
the
country
had
not
the
fatal
influence
of
north
american
spirit
paralyzed
all
his
efforts
what
wonder
that
presidents
so
spoken
of
should
sign
away
their
lands
and
waters
but
presuming
all
political
obstacles
to
be
removed
and
that
as
regards
the
possession
of
the
land
and
the
right
of
making
a
canal
through
it
everything
had
been
conceded
there
remain
two
considerable
difficulties
in
the
first
place
the
nature
of
the
waters
and
land
which
seems
to
prohibit
the
cutting
of
a
canal
except
at
an
expense
much
more
enormous
than
any
that
has
been
ever
named
and
secondly
the
amount
of
money
to
be
collected
even
if
belly
figures
be
correct
he
states
that
he
can
complete
the
work
for
four
million
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
from
whence
is
that
sum
to
be
procured
as
regards
the
first
difficulty
i
from
my
own
knowledge
can
say
nothing
not
being
an
engineer
and
having
seen
only
a
small
portion
of
the
projected
route
i
must
therefore
refer
to
engineer
and
those
who
hold
views
differing
from
belly
belly
is
thomé
de
gamond
who
in
the
pamphlet
above
alluded
to
puts
forward
his
calculations
and
sends
in
his
demand
for
the
work
at
four
million
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
the
route
is
by
the
river
san
juan
a
portion
of
which
is
so
shallow
that
canoes
in
their
course
are
frequently
grounded
when
the
waters
are
low
and
other
parts
of
which
consist
of
rapids
it
then
goes
through
the
lake
a
channel
through
which
must
be
dredged
or
cleared
with
gunpowder
before
it
can
carry
ships
and
then
out
to
the
pacific
by
a
canal
which
must
be
cut
through
the
mountains
there
is
nothing
in
the
mere
sound
of
all
this
to
make
a
man
who
is
ignorant
on
the
subject
as
i
and
most
men
are
feel
that
the
work
could
not
be
done
for
the
sum
named
but
before
investing
cash
in
the
plan
one
would
like
to
be
sure
of
the
engineer
and
to
know
that
he
has
made
his
surveys
very
accurately
now
it
appears
that
thomé
de
gamond
has
never
set
foot
in
central
america
or
if
he
has
done
so
now
and
i
do
not
know
whether
he
has
or
has
not
he
never
had
done
so
when
he
drew
out
his
project
nor
as
it
would
appear
has
he
even
done
his
work
trusting
to
the
eyes
and
hands
of
others
as
far
as
one
can
learn
no
surveys
whatsoever
have
been
taken
for
this
gigantic
scheme
the
engineer
tells
us
that
he
has
used
marine
charts
and
hydrographical
drawings
made
by
officers
of
various
nations
which
enable
him
to
regard
his
own
knowledge
as
sufficiently
exact
as
far
as
shores
and
levels
of
the
rivers
are
concerned
and
that
with
reference
to
the
track
of
his
canal
he
has
taken
into
his
service
utilisé
the
works
of
various
surveying
engineers
among
them
colonel
child
the
american
they
to
be
sure
do
leave
him
at
a
loss
as
to
the
interior
plateau
of
the
mosquito
country
and
some
regions
to
the
east
and
south
of
the
lake
the
canal
must
enter
the
lake
by
the
but
this
is
a
matter
of
no
moment
seeing
that
all
these
countries
are
covered
by
virgin
forests
and
can
therefore
easily
be
arranged
gentlemen
capitalists
will
you
on
this
showing
take
shares
in
the
concern
the
best
real
survey
executed
with
reference
to
any
kindred
project
was
that
made
by
colonel
child
an
officer
of
engineers
belonging
to
the
united
states
i
believe
i
may
say
this
without
hesitation
and
it
is
to
colonel
child
survey
that
belly
most
frequently
refers
but
the
facts
as
stated
by
colonel
child
prove
the
absolute
absurdity
of
belly
plan
he
was
employed
in
by
an
american
company
which
as
it
went
to
the
considerable
expense
of
having
such
work
absolutely
done
was
no
doubt
in
earnest
in
its
intentions
with
reference
to
a
canal
colonel
child
did
not
actually
report
against
the
canal
he
explained
what
could
be
done
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
leaving
it
to
others
to
decide
whether
in
effecting
so
much
that
sum
of
money
would
be
well
laid
out
he
showed
that
a
canal
seventeen
feet
deep
might
be
made
taking
the
course
of
the
san
juan
and
that
of
the
lake
as
suggested
by
belly
for
a
sum
of
millions
of
dollars
or
six
million
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
but
when
the
matter
came
to
be
considered
by
men
versed
in
such
concerns
it
was
seen
that
a
canal
with
a
depth
of
only
seventeen
feet
of
water
would
not
admit
of
such
vessels
as
those
by
which
alone
such
a
canal
could
be
beneficially
used
passengers
treasure
and
light
goods
can
easily
be
transhipped
and
carried
across
by
railway
the
canal
if
made
at
all
must
be
made
for
the
passage
of
large
vessels
built
for
heavy
goods
for
such
vessels
a
canal
must
hold
not
less
than
feet
of
water
it
was
calculated
that
a
cutting
of
such
depth
would
cost
much
more
than
double
the
sum
needed
for
that
intended
to
contain
seventeen
feet
more
that
is
than
twelve
million
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
the
matter
was
then
abandoned
on
the
conviction
that
no
ship
canal
made
at
such
a
cost
could
by
any
probability
become
remunerative
in
point
of
time
it
could
never
compete
with
the
railway
colonel
child
had
calculated
that
a
delay
of
two
days
would
take
place
in
the
locks
and
even
as
regards
heavy
goods
no
extreme
freight
could
be
levied
as
saving
of
expense
with
them
would
be
of
much
greater
object
than
saving
of
time
that
this
decision
was
reached
on
good
grounds
and
that
the
project
then
at
any
rate
was
made
bonâ
fide
there
can
i
believe
be
no
doubt
in
opposition
to
such
a
decision
made
on
such
grounds
and
with
no
encouragement
but
that
given
by
the
calculations
of
an
engineer
who
has
himself
made
no
surveys
i
can
not
think
it
likely
that
this
new
plan
will
ever
be
carried
out
the
eloquence
even
of
belly
backed
by
such
arguments
will
hardly
collect
four
million
eight
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
even
if
it
did
the
prudence
of
m
belly
would
hardly
throw
such
an
amount
of
treasure
into
the
san
juan
river
as
i
have
before
said
there
appears
to
have
been
no
company
formed
belly
is
the
director
and
he
has
a
bureau
of
direction
in
the
rue
de
provence
but
though
deficient
as
regards
chairmen
directors
and
shareholders
he
is
magnificently
provided
with
officials
then
again
there
comes
a
blank
though
the
corps
of
officers
was
complete
when
i
was
in
costa
rica
at
any
rate
as
regards
their
names
the
workmen
had
not
arrived
not
even
the
skilled
labourers
who
were
to
come
in
detachments
of
by
each
mail
packet
the
mail
packets
came
but
not
the
skilled
labourers
shortly
before
my
arrival
at
san
josé
there
appeared
in
the
journal
published
in
that
town
a
list
of
officers
to
be
employed
by
felix
belly
the
de
la
compañie
del
canal
the
first
of
these
is
don
andres
le
vasseur
minister
plenipotentiary
veteran
officer
of
the
guard
imperial
commander
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
knight
of
the
order
of
gregory
he
is
of
the
direction
then
there
are
other
secretaries
in
the
first
place
prince
polignac
veteran
officer
of
the
cavalry
of
the
cazadores
in
africa
he
at
any
rate
is
a
fact
for
did
i
not
meet
him
and
the
mahon
nicodemus
and
polyphemus
not
standing
naked
in
the
open
air
but
drinking
brandy
and
water
at
the
little
inn
at
esparza
arcades
ambo
the
next
secretary
is
don
henrique
le
vasseur
he
is
dibujador
fotografo
which
i
take
to
mean
photographical
artist
and
then
don
andres
he
is
the
private
secretary
we
next
come
to
the
engineers
with
reference
to
geology
and
mineralogy
belly
has
employed
don
josé
durocher
whose
titles
taken
from
the
faculty
of
science
at
rennes
the
legion
of
honour
are
too
long
to
quote
don
eugénio
ponsard
who
also
is
not
without
his
titles
is
the
working
engineer
on
these
subjects
and
then
joined
to
them
as
is
don
henrique
peudifer
whose
name
is
also
honoured
with
various
adjuncts
the
engineers
who
are
to
be
intrusted
with
the
surveys
and
works
of
the
canals
are
named
next
there
are
four
such
to
whom
are
joined
five
conductors
of
the
works
and
eight
special
masters
of
the
men
all
these
composed
an
expedition
which
left
southampton
on
the
of
february
or
which
should
so
have
left
it
had
they
acted
up
to
belly
promises
then
by
the
packet
of
the
of
march
there
came
or
at
least
there
should
have
come
for
we
are
told
that
they
sailed
another
expedition
i
can
not
afford
to
give
all
the
names
but
they
are
and
very
honourable
among
them
there
was
a
maker
of
bricks
who
in
his
own
country
had
been
a
chief
of
the
works
in
the
imperial
manufactory
of
porcelain
at
sèvres
having
enticed
him
from
so
high
a
position
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
belly
will
treat
him
well
in
central
america
there
are
or
were
hydrographical
engineers
and
agricultural
engineers
master
carpenters
and
masters
of
various
other
specialties
i
fear
all
these
gentlemen
came
to
grief
on
the
road
for
i
think
i
may
say
that
no
such
learned
troops
came
through
with
the
mail
packets
which
left
southampton
on
the
days
indicated
then
by
the
following
steamers
there
would
it
is
stated
be
despatched
in
succession
an
inspector
of
telegraphs
an
engineer
for
making
gas
an
engineer
to
be
charged
with
the
fabrication
of
the
iron
way
an
a
scientific
commission
for
geology
mineralogy
meteorology
and
natural
history
in
general
and
attached
to
all
the
engineers
will
come
or
now
long
since
should
have
come
the
conductors
of
works
and
special
masters
of
men
who
are
joined
with
them
in
their
operations
these
are
to
consist
principally
of
veteran
soldiers
of
the
engineers
and
the
artillery
these
gentlemen
also
must
i
fear
have
been
cast
away
between
southampton
and
thomas
if
they
left
the
former
port
by
either
of
the
two
mail
steamers
following
those
two
specially
indicated
i
think
i
may
say
positively
that
no
such
parties
were
forwarded
from
thomas
the
general
inspection
of
the
works
will
be
intrusted
ultimately
to
a
french
and
to
an
english
engineer
the
frenchman
will
of
course
be
thomé
de
gamond
the
englishman
is
to
be
locke
member
of
parliament
if
indeed
this
latter
assertion
were
true
but
i
think
i
may
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
it
is
untrue
all
the
above
certainly
sounds
very
grand
especially
when
given
at
full
length
in
the
spanish
language
out
there
in
central
america
the
list
is
effective
here
in
england
we
should
like
to
see
the
list
of
the
directors
as
well
and
to
have
some
idea
how
much
money
has
been
subscribed
mankind
perhaps
can
trust
belly
for
much
but
not
for
everything
in
the
month
of
may
don
juan
rafael
mora
the
president
of
costa
rica
left
his
dominions
and
proceeded
to
rivas
in
nicaragua
to
assist
at
the
inauguration
of
the
opening
of
the
works
of
the
canal
when
i
and
my
companion
met
him
at
esparza
accompanied
by
nicodemus
and
polyphemus
he
was
making
this
journey
belly
has
already
described
in
eloquent
language
how
on
a
previous
occasion
this
potentate
condescended
to
leave
his
own
kingdom
and
visit
that
of
a
neighbour
thus
sacrificing
individual
rank
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
and
civilization
he
was
willing
to
do
this
even
once
again
having
borrowed
a
french
to
carry
him
from
in
his
own
territories
to
juan
del
sur
in
the
territory
of
nicaragua
he
started
with
his
suite
of
whom
the
prince
and
the
were
such
distinguished
members
but
lo
when
he
arrived
at
rivas
a
few
miles
up
from
san
juan
del
sur
at
rivas
where
with
gala
holiday
triumph
the
canal
was
to
be
inaugurated
the
canal
from
whence
were
to
come
new
views
and
unlimited
horizons
lo
when
he
there
arrived
no
was
there
to
meet
him
no
belly
attended
by
and
brickmakers
from
sèvres
to
do
him
honour
there
was
not
even
one
french
pupil
from
the
polytechnic
school
to
turn
a
sod
with
a
silver
spade
in
lieu
of
this
some
officer
of
nicaragua
called
upon
poor
don
juan
to
pay
the
usual
duty
on
bringing
his
portmanteau
into
rivas
other
new
views
and
other
unlimited
horizons
had
it
seems
been
dawning
on
belly
one
of
the
first
words
of
which
a
man
has
to
learn
the
meaning
on
reaching
these
countries
is
transit
central
america
can
only
be
great
in
the
world
as
egypt
can
be
only
great
by
being
a
passage
between
other
parts
of
the
world
which
are
in
themselves
great
we
englishmen
all
know
crewe
crewe
has
become
a
town
of
considerable
importance
as
being
a
great
railway
junction
men
must
reach
crewe
and
leave
crewe
continually
and
the
concourse
there
has
rendered
labour
necessary
labourers
of
all
sorts
must
live
in
houses
and
require
bakers
and
grocers
to
supply
them
so
crewe
has
grown
up
and
grown
important
and
so
will
central
america
become
important
aspinwall
colon
as
we
call
it
has
become
a
town
in
this
way
within
the
last
ten
years
transit
in
these
parts
means
the
trade
of
carrying
people
across
central
america
and
a
deal
of
transit
has
been
done
and
money
made
by
carrying
people
across
nicaragua
by
way
of
the
great
lake
this
has
hitherto
been
effected
by
boats
i
will
say
one
word
or
so
on
the
subject
when
i
have
done
as
i
very
soon
shall
have
done
with
belly
now
it
is
very
generally
thought
that
belly
when
he
speaks
of
this
canal
means
transit
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
a
great
carrying
trade
might
be
opened
much
to
the
advantage
of
nicaragua
and
to
the
advantage
of
costa
rica
also
though
not
to
the
same
extent
if
all
this
canal
grandiloquence
would
pave
the
way
to
transit
might
it
not
be
well
what
if
another
agreement
could
be
made
giving
to
belly
and
his
company
the
sole
right
of
transit
through
nicaragua
till
the
grand
canal
should
be
completed
a
very
long
lease
might
not
something
be
done
in
this
way
but
don
juan
mora
there
don
juan
of
costa
rica
that
man
altogether
hors
de
ligne
grand
as
he
is
need
know
nothing
about
this
let
him
left
quite
in
darkness
as
to
this
new
view
these
altered
unlimited
horizons
go
to
rivas
if
he
will
and
pay
his
custom
dues
it
may
be
that
i
have
written
at
too
great
length
and
with
an
energy
disproportionate
to
the
subject
on
this
matter
of
the
nicaraguan
canal
scheme
i
do
not
know
that
the
english
public
generally
or
at
any
rate
that
portion
of
it
which
may
perhaps
read
my
book
is
very
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
we
hear
now
and
then
something
of
the
treaty
and
a
word
or
two
is
said
about
the
panama
route
to
australia
but
the
subject
is
not
generally
interesting
to
us
as
is
that
of
the
passage
through
egypt
we
can
reach
australia
by
another
and
a
shorter
route
and
as
for
vancouver
island
and
frazer
river
they
as
yet
are
very
young
but
the
matter
will
become
of
importance
and
to
a
man
in
central
america
let
his
visit
to
that
country
be
ever
so
short
it
becomes
at
once
important
to
me
it
was
grievous
to
find
a
work
so
necessary
to
the
world
as
this
of
opening
a
way
over
the
isthmus
tampered
with
and
to
a
degree
hindered
by
a
scheme
which
i
can
not
but
regard
as
unreal
but
unreal
as
it
may
be
this
project
has
reached
dimensions
which
make
it
in
some
way
worthy
of
notice
a
french
ship
of
war
was
sent
to
take
the
president
mora
and
his
suite
on
their
unfortunate
journey
to
rivas
and
an
english
ship
of
war
was
sent
to
bring
them
back
the
extension
of
such
privileges
to
the
president
of
a
republic
in
central
america
may
be
very
well
but
men
seeing
on
what
business
this
president
was
travelling
not
unnaturally
regarded
the
courtesy
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
importance
of
work
i
do
not
wish
to
use
hard
names
but
i
can
not
think
that
the
project
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
covers
any
true
intention
of
making
a
canal
and
such
schemes
if
not
real
if
not
true
in
the
outward
bearings
which
they
show
to
the
world
go
far
to
deter
others
which
might
be
real
and
now
i
will
say
nothing
further
about
belly
as
i
have
before
stated
there
was
some
few
years
since
a
considerable
passenger
traffic
through
central
america
by
the
route
of
the
lake
of
nicaragua
this
of
course
was
in
the
hands
of
the
americans
and
the
passengers
were
chiefly
those
going
and
coming
between
the
eastern
states
and
california
they
came
down
to
greytown
at
the
mouth
of
the
san
juan
river
in
steamers
from
new
york
and
i
believe
from
various
american
ports
went
up
the
san
juan
river
in
other
steamers
with
flat
bottoms
prepared
for
those
waters
across
the
lake
in
the
same
way
and
then
by
a
good
road
over
the
intervening
neck
of
land
between
the
lake
and
the
pacific
of
course
the
panama
railway
has
done
much
to
interfere
with
this
in
the
first
place
a
rival
route
has
thus
been
opened
though
i
doubt
whether
it
would
be
a
quicker
route
from
new
york
to
california
if
the
way
by
the
lake
were
well
organized
and
then
the
company
possessing
the
line
of
steamers
running
to
aspinwall
from
new
york
has
been
able
to
buy
off
the
line
which
would
otherwise
run
to
greytown
but
this
rivalship
has
not
been
the
main
cause
of
the
total
stoppage
of
the
nicaraguan
route
the
filibusters
came
into
that
land
and
destroyed
everything
they
dropped
down
from
california
on
realejo
leon
manaqua
granada
and
all
the
western
coast
of
nicaragua
then
others
came
from
the
states
from
mobile
and
new
orleans
and
swarmed
up
the
san
juan
river
devouring
everything
before
them
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
walker
idea
in
his
attempt
to
possess
himself
of
this
country
was
that
he
could
thus
become
master
of
the
passage
across
the
isthmus
he
saw
as
so
many
others
have
seen
the
importance
of
the
locality
in
this
point
of
view
and
he
probably
felt
that
if
he
could
make
himself
lord
of
the
soil
by
his
own
exertions
and
on
his
own
bottom
his
mother
country
the
united
states
would
not
be
slow
to
recognize
him
i
he
would
have
said
have
procured
for
you
the
ownership
of
the
road
which
is
so
desirable
for
you
pay
me
by
making
me
your
lieutenant
here
and
protecting
me
in
that
position
the
idea
was
not
badly
planned
but
it
was
of
course
radically
unjust
it
was
a
contemplated
filching
of
the
road
and
walker
found
as
all
men
do
find
that
he
could
not
easily
get
good
tools
to
do
bad
work
he
tried
the
job
with
a
very
rough
lot
of
tools
and
now
though
he
has
done
much
harm
to
others
he
has
done
very
little
good
to
himself
i
do
not
think
that
we
shall
hear
much
more
of
him
and
among
the
worst
of
the
injuries
which
he
has
done
is
this
disturbance
of
the
lake
traffic
this
route
has
been
altogether
abandoned
there
in
the
san
juan
river
is
to
be
seen
one
old
steamer
with
its
bottom
upwards
a
relic
of
the
filibusters
and
their
destruction
all
along
the
banks
tales
are
told
of
their
injustice
and
sufferings
how
recklessly
they
robbed
on
their
journey
up
the
country
and
how
they
returned
back
to
greytown
those
who
did
return
whose
bones
are
not
whitening
the
lake
shores
wounded
maimed
and
miserable
along
the
route
traders
were
beginning
to
establish
themselves
men
prepared
to
provide
the
travellers
with
food
and
drink
and
the
boats
with
fuel
for
their
steam
an
end
for
the
present
has
been
put
to
all
this
the
weak
governments
of
the
country
have
been
able
to
afford
no
protection
to
these
men
and
placed
as
they
were
beyond
the
protection
of
england
or
the
united
states
they
have
been
completely
open
to
attack
the
filibusters
for
a
while
have
destroyed
the
transit
through
nicaragua
and
it
is
hardly
matter
of
surprise
that
the
presidents
of
that
and
the
neighbouring
republics
should
catch
at
any
scheme
which
proposes
to
give
them
back
this
advantage
especially
when
promise
is
made
of
the
additional
advantage
of
effectual
protection
it
is
much
to
be
desired
on
all
accounts
that
this
route
should
be
again
opened
here
i
think
is
to
be
found
the
best
chance
of
establishing
an
immediate
competition
with
the
panama
railway
for
although
such
a
route
will
not
offer
the
comfort
of
the
panama
line
or
till
it
be
well
organized
the
same
rapidity
it
would
nevertheless
draw
to
it
a
great
portion
of
the
traffic
and
men
and
women
going
in
numbers
would
be
carried
at
cheaper
rates
and
these
cheaper
rates
in
nicaragua
would
probably
at
once
lessen
the
fares
now
charged
by
the
panama
railway
competition
would
certainly
be
advantageous
and
for
the
present
i
see
no
other
opening
for
a
competitive
route
a
railway
along
the
banks
of
the
san
juan
would
i
fear
be
too
expensive
the
distance
is
above
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
the
line
would
be
very
costly
but
a
line
of
rails
from
the
lake
to
the
pacific
might
be
made
comparatively
at
a
small
outlay
and
would
greatly
add
to
the
comfort
and
rapidity
of
the
passage
to
us
englishmen
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
in
whose
hands
the
transit
may
be
so
long
as
it
is
free
and
open
to
all
the
world
so
long
as
a
difference
of
nationality
creates
no
difference
in
the
fares
charged
or
in
the
facilities
afforded
for
our
own
purposes
i
have
no
doubt
the
panama
line
is
the
best
and
will
be
the
route
we
shall
use
but
we
should
be
delighted
to
see
a
second
line
opened
if
squier
can
accomplish
his
line
through
honduras
we
will
give
him
great
honour
and
acknowledge
that
he
has
done
the
world
a
service
in
the
mean
time
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
the
lake
transit
chapter
xxii
the
bermudas
in
may
i
returned
from
greytown
and
the
waters
of
the
san
juan
to
thomas
spending
a
few
days
at
aspinwall
and
panama
on
my
journey
as
i
have
before
explained
and
on
this
occasion
that
of
my
fourth
visit
to
thomas
i
was
happy
enough
to
escape
without
any
long
stay
there
my
course
now
lay
to
the
bermudas
to
which
islands
a
steamer
runs
once
a
month
from
that
disagreeable
little
depôt
of
steam
navigation
but
as
this
boat
is
fitted
to
certain
arrivals
and
despatches
not
at
thomas
but
at
halifax
and
as
we
reached
thomas
late
on
the
night
of
the
day
on
which
she
should
have
sailed
and
as
my
missing
that
vessel
would
have
entailed
on
me
another
month
sojourn
and
that
a
summer
month
among
those
islands
it
may
be
imagined
that
i
was
rather
lively
on
entering
the
harbour
keenly
lively
to
ascertain
whether
the
such
is
the
name
of
the
bermuda
boat
was
or
was
not
gone
on
her
mission
i
see
her
red
funnel
right
across
the
harbour
said
the
chief
officer
looking
through
infinite
darkness
i
disbelieved
him
and
accused
him
of
hoaxing
me
look
yourself
said
he
handing
me
his
glass
but
all
the
glasses
in
the
world
wo
turn
darkness
into
light
i
know
not
by
what
educational
process
the
eyes
of
sailors
become
like
those
of
cats
in
this
instance
the
chief
officer
had
seen
aright
and
then
after
a
visit
to
the
made
at
i
went
to
bed
a
happy
man
we
started
the
next
day
at
or
rather
i
should
say
the
same
day
and
i
did
no
more
than
breakfast
on
shore
i
then
left
that
favoured
island
i
trust
for
the
last
time
an
island
which
i
believe
may
be
called
the
white
man
grave
with
quite
as
much
truth
as
any
place
on
the
coast
of
africa
we
steamed
out
and
i
stood
on
the
stern
taking
a
last
look
at
the
three
hills
of
the
panorama
it
is
certainly
a
very
pretty
place
seen
from
a
moderate
and
safe
distance
and
seen
as
a
picture
but
it
should
be
seen
in
that
way
and
in
no
other
we
started
and
i
at
any
rate
with
joy
but
my
joy
was
not
of
long
duration
for
the
rolled
hideously
screw
boats
propellers
as
the
americans
call
them
with
their
wonted
genteel
propriety
always
do
roll
and
have
been
invented
with
the
view
of
making
sea
passages
more
disagreeable
than
they
were
did
any
one
of
my
readers
ever
have
a
berth
allotted
to
him
just
over
the
screw
if
so
he
knows
exactly
the
feeling
of
being
brayed
in
a
mortar
in
four
days
we
reached
bermuda
and
made
our
way
into
harbour
looking
back
at
my
fortnight
sojourn
there
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
place
in
the
world
as
to
which
there
can
be
less
to
be
said
than
there
is
about
this
island
sayings
at
least
of
the
sort
in
which
it
is
my
nature
to
express
itself
its
geological
formation
is
i
have
no
doubt
mysterious
it
seems
to
be
made
of
soft
white
stone
composed
mostly
of
little
shells
so
soft
indeed
that
you
might
cut
bermuda
up
with
a
handsaw
and
people
are
cutting
bermuda
up
with
handsaws
one
little
island
that
on
which
the
convicts
are
established
has
been
altogether
so
cut
up
already
when
i
visited
it
two
fat
convicts
were
working
away
slowly
at
the
last
fragment
but
i
am
no
geologist
and
can
give
no
opinion
favourable
or
otherwise
as
to
that
doctrine
that
these
islands
are
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
only
if
so
the
seas
in
those
days
must
have
held
a
distance
much
more
respectful
than
at
present
every
one
of
course
knows
that
there
are
three
hundred
and
of
these
islands
all
lying
within
twenty
miles
in
length
and
three
in
breadth
they
are
surrounded
too
by
reefs
or
rocks
hidden
by
water
which
stretch
out
into
the
sea
in
some
places
for
eight
or
ten
miles
making
the
navigation
very
difficult
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
very
perilous
nor
am
i
prepared
to
say
whether
or
no
the
bermudas
was
the
scene
of
ariel
tricksy
doings
they
were
first
discovered
in
by
bermudez
a
spaniard
and
shakespere
may
have
heard
of
them
some
indistinct
surmises
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
speak
of
the
still
vexed
bermoothes
if
these
be
the
veritable
scenes
of
incantations
i
will
at
any
rate
say
this
that
there
are
now
to
be
found
stronger
traces
of
the
breed
of
caliban
than
of
that
of
ariel
strong
however
of
neither
for
though
caliban
did
not
relish
working
for
his
master
more
keenly
than
a
bermudian
of
the
present
day
there
was
nevertheless
about
him
a
sort
of
energy
which
is
altogether
wanting
in
the
existing
islanders
a
gentleman
has
lately
written
a
book
i
am
told
a
very
good
book
called
bermuda
as
a
colony
a
fortress
and
a
prison
this
book
i
am
sure
gives
accurately
all
the
information
which
research
could
collect
as
to
these
islands
under
the
headings
named
i
made
no
research
and
pretend
only
to
state
the
results
of
cursory
observation
as
a
fortress
no
doubt
it
is
very
strong
i
have
no
doubt
on
the
matter
seeing
that
i
am
a
patriotic
englishman
and
as
such
believe
all
english
fortifications
to
be
strong
it
is
however
a
matter
on
which
the
opinion
of
no
civilian
can
be
of
weight
unless
he
have
deeply
studied
the
subject
in
which
case
he
so
far
ceases
to
be
a
civilian
everything
looked
very
clean
and
a
great
many
flags
were
flying
on
sundays
and
the
queen
birthday
and
all
seemed
to
be
of
the
importance
to
us
of
the
position
there
can
be
no
question
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
that
we
should
be
driven
to
use
an
armed
fleet
in
the
western
waters
bermuda
will
be
as
serviceable
to
us
there
as
malta
is
in
the
mediterranean
so
much
for
the
fortress
as
to
the
prison
i
will
say
a
word
or
two
just
now
seeing
that
it
is
in
that
light
that
the
place
was
chiefly
interesting
to
me
but
first
for
the
colony
snow
is
not
prevalent
in
bermuda
at
least
not
in
the
months
of
may
and
june
but
the
first
look
of
the
houses
in
each
of
its
two
small
towns
and
indeed
all
over
the
island
gives
one
the
idea
of
a
snow
storm
every
house
is
white
up
from
the
ground
to
the
very
point
of
the
roof
nothing
is
in
so
great
demand
as
whitewash
they
whitewash
their
houses
incessantly
and
always
include
the
roofs
this
becomes
a
nuisance
from
the
glare
it
occasions
and
is
at
last
painful
to
the
eyes
they
say
there
that
it
is
cleanly
and
cheap
and
no
one
can
deny
that
cleanliness
and
economy
are
important
domestic
virtues
there
are
two
towns
situated
on
different
islands
called
george
and
hamilton
the
former
is
the
of
the
military
the
latter
of
the
governor
in
speaking
of
the
place
as
a
fortress
i
should
have
said
that
it
is
the
summer
of
the
admiral
in
command
of
the
halifax
station
the
which
is
connected
with
the
convict
establishment
is
at
an
island
called
ireland
but
the
residence
of
the
admiral
is
not
far
from
hamilton
on
that
which
the
bermudians
call
the
continent
i
spent
a
week
in
each
of
these
towns
and
i
can
hardly
say
which
i
found
the
most
triste
the
island
or
islands
as
one
must
always
say
using
the
plural
number
have
many
gifts
of
nature
to
recommend
them
they
are
extremely
fertile
the
land
with
a
very
moderate
amount
of
cultivation
will
give
two
crops
of
ordinary
potatoes
and
one
crop
of
sweet
potatoes
in
the
year
most
fruits
will
grow
here
both
those
of
the
tropics
and
of
the
more
northern
latitudes
oranges
and
lemons
peaches
and
strawberries
bananas
and
mulberries
thrive
or
thrive
equally
well
if
they
were
even
slightly
encouraged
to
do
so
no
climate
in
the
world
probably
is
better
adapted
for
beetroot
potatoes
onions
and
tomatoes
the
place
is
so
circumstanced
geographically
that
it
should
be
the
early
for
new
york
as
to
a
certain
small
extent
it
is
new
york
can
not
get
her
early
potatoes
potatoes
in
may
and
june
from
her
own
soil
but
bermuda
can
give
them
to
her
in
any
quantity
arrowroot
also
grows
here
to
perfection
the
bermudians
claim
to
say
that
their
arrowroot
is
the
best
in
the
world
and
i
believe
that
none
bears
a
higher
price
then
the
land
produces
barley
oats
and
indian
corn
and
not
only
produces
them
but
produces
two
sometimes
three
crops
a
year
let
the
english
farmer
with
his
fallow
field
think
of
that
but
with
all
their
advantages
bermuda
is
very
poor
perhaps
i
should
add
that
on
the
whole
she
is
contented
with
her
poverty
and
if
so
why
disturb
such
contentment
but
nevertheless
one
can
not
teach
oneself
not
to
be
desirous
of
progress
one
can
not
but
feel
it
sad
to
see
people
neglecting
the
good
things
which
are
under
their
feet
lemons
and
oranges
there
are
now
none
in
bermuda
the
trees
suffered
a
blight
some
year
or
two
since
and
no
effort
has
been
made
to
restore
them
i
saw
no
fruit
of
any
description
though
i
am
told
i
was
there
in
the
proper
season
and
heard
much
of
the
fruit
that
there
used
to
be
in
former
days
i
saw
no
vegetables
but
potatoes
and
onions
and
was
told
that
as
a
rule
the
people
are
satisfied
with
them
i
did
not
once
encounter
a
piece
of
meat
fit
to
be
eaten
excepting
when
i
dined
on
rations
supplied
by
the
convict
establishment
the
poultry
was
somewhat
better
than
the
meat
but
yet
of
a
very
poor
description
both
bread
and
butter
are
bad
the
latter
quite
uneatable
english
people
whom
i
met
declared
that
they
were
unable
to
get
anything
to
eat
the
people
both
white
and
black
seemed
to
be
only
half
awake
the
land
is
only
half
cultivated
and
hardly
half
is
tilled
of
that
which
might
be
tilled
the
reason
of
this
neglect
for
i
maintain
that
it
is
neglect
should
however
be
explained
nearly
all
the
islands
are
covered
with
small
stunted
bushy
cedar
trees
not
cedars
such
as
those
of
lebanon
not
the
cedar
trees
of
central
america
nor
those
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
our
gardens
at
home
in
bermuda
they
are
as
i
have
said
low
bushy
trees
much
resembling
stunted
firs
but
the
wood
when
it
can
be
found
large
enough
is
they
say
good
for
shipbuilding
and
as
shipbuilding
has
for
years
been
a
trade
in
these
islands
the
old
owners
of
the
property
do
not
like
to
clear
their
land
this
was
all
very
well
as
long
as
the
land
had
no
special
virtue
as
long
as
a
market
such
as
that
afforded
by
new
york
was
wanting
but
now
that
the
market
has
been
opened
there
can
be
no
doubt
indeed
nobody
does
doubt
that
if
the
land
were
cleared
its
money
value
would
be
greatly
more
than
it
now
is
every
one
to
whom
i
spoke
admitted
this
and
complained
of
the
backwardness
of
the
island
in
improvements
but
no
one
tries
to
remedy
this
now
they
had
a
governor
there
some
years
ago
who
did
much
to
cure
this
state
of
things
who
did
show
them
that
money
was
to
be
made
by
producing
potatoes
and
sending
them
out
of
the
island
this
was
sir
reid
the
man
of
storms
he
seems
to
have
had
some
tolerably
efficient
idea
of
what
a
governor
duty
should
be
in
such
a
place
as
bermuda
to
be
helped
first
at
every
table
and
to
be
called
your
excellency
and
then
to
receive
some
thousands
a
year
for
undergoing
these
duties
is
all
very
well
is
very
nice
for
a
military
gentleman
in
the
decline
of
years
it
is
very
well
that
england
can
so
provide
for
a
few
of
her
old
military
gentlemen
but
when
the
military
gentlemen
selected
can
do
something
else
besides
it
does
make
such
a
difference
sir
reid
did
do
much
else
and
if
there
could
be
found
another
sir
reid
or
two
to
take
their
turns
in
bermuda
for
six
years
each
the
scrubby
bushes
would
give
way
and
the
earth
would
bring
forth
her
increase
the
sleepiness
of
the
people
appeared
to
me
the
most
prevailing
characteristic
of
the
place
there
seemed
to
be
no
energy
among
the
natives
no
idea
of
going
none
of
that
principle
of
constant
motion
which
is
found
so
strongly
developed
among
their
great
neighbours
in
the
united
states
to
say
that
they
live
for
eating
and
drinking
would
be
to
wrong
them
they
want
the
energy
for
the
gratification
of
such
vicious
tastes
to
live
and
die
would
seem
to
be
enough
for
them
to
live
and
die
as
their
fathers
and
mothers
did
before
them
in
the
same
houses
using
the
same
furniture
nurtured
on
the
same
food
and
enjoying
the
same
immunity
from
the
dangers
of
excitement
i
must
confess
that
during
the
short
period
of
my
sojourn
there
i
myself
was
completely
overtaken
by
the
same
sort
of
lassitude
i
could
not
walk
a
mile
without
fatigue
i
was
always
anxious
to
be
supine
lying
down
whenever
i
could
find
a
sofa
ever
anxious
for
a
and
solicitous
for
a
quick
arrival
of
the
hour
of
bed
which
used
to
be
about
nine
indeed
this
feeling
became
so
strong
with
me
that
i
feared
i
was
ill
and
began
to
speculate
as
to
the
effects
and
pleasures
of
a
low
fever
and
a
bermuda
doctor
i
was
comforted
however
by
an
assurance
that
everybody
was
suffering
in
the
same
way
when
the
south
wind
blows
it
is
always
so
the
south
wind
must
be
very
prevalent
then
i
suggested
i
was
told
that
it
was
very
prevalent
during
the
period
of
my
visit
it
was
all
south
wind
the
weather
was
not
hot
not
hot
at
least
to
me
who
had
just
come
up
from
panama
and
the
fiery
furnace
of
aspinwall
but
the
air
was
damp
and
muggy
and
disagreeable
to
me
it
was
the
most
trying
climate
that
i
had
encountered
they
have
had
yellow
fever
there
twice
within
the
last
eight
years
and
on
both
occasions
it
was
very
fatal
singularly
enough
on
its
latter
coming
the
natives
suffered
much
more
than
strangers
this
is
altogether
opposed
to
the
usual
habits
of
the
yellow
fever
which
is
imagined
to
be
ever
cautious
in
sparing
those
who
are
indigenous
to
the
land
it
visits
the
working
population
here
are
almost
all
negroes
i
should
say
that
this
is
quite
as
much
a
rule
here
as
in
any
of
the
west
indies
of
course
there
are
coloured
people
men
and
women
of
mixed
breed
but
they
are
not
numerous
as
in
jamaica
or
if
so
they
are
so
nearly
akin
to
the
negro
as
not
to
be
observed
there
are
i
think
none
of
those
all
but
white
ladies
and
gentlemen
whose
position
in
life
is
so
distressing
the
negroes
are
well
off
as
a
rule
they
can
earn
a
day
from
that
to
for
exceptional
jobs
men
can
not
be
had
under
a
dollar
or
on
these
wages
they
can
live
well
by
working
three
days
a
week
and
such
appears
to
be
their
habit
it
seems
to
me
that
no
enfranchised
negro
entertains
an
idea
of
daily
work
work
to
them
is
an
exceptional
circumstance
as
to
us
may
be
a
spell
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
hours
in
the
same
day
we
do
such
a
thing
occasionally
for
certain
objects
and
for
certain
objects
they
are
willing
to
work
occasionally
the
population
is
about
eleven
thousand
that
of
the
negroes
and
coloured
people
does
not
much
exceed
that
of
the
whites
that
of
the
females
greatly
exceeds
that
of
the
males
both
among
the
white
and
coloured
people
among
the
negroes
i
noticed
this
that
if
not
more
active
than
their
brethren
in
the
west
indies
they
are
at
least
more
civil
and
less
sullen
in
their
manner
but
then
again
they
are
without
the
singular
mixture
of
fun
and
vanity
which
makes
the
jamaica
negro
so
amusing
for
a
while
these
islands
are
certainly
very
pretty
or
i
should
perhaps
say
that
the
sea
which
forms
itself
into
bays
and
creeks
by
running
in
among
them
is
very
pretty
the
water
is
quite
clear
and
transparent
there
being
little
or
no
sand
on
those
sides
on
which
the
ocean
makes
its
entrance
and
clear
water
is
in
itself
so
beautiful
then
the
singular
way
in
which
the
land
is
broken
up
into
narrow
necks
islands
and
promontories
running
here
and
there
in
a
capricious
manner
creating
a
desire
for
amphibiosity
necessarily
creates
beauty
but
it
is
mostly
the
beauty
of
the
sea
and
not
of
the
land
the
islands
are
flat
or
at
any
rate
there
is
no
considerable
elevation
in
them
they
are
covered
throughout
with
those
scrubby
little
trees
and
although
the
trees
are
green
and
therefore
when
seen
from
the
sea
give
a
freshness
to
the
landscape
they
are
uninteresting
and
monotonous
on
shore
i
must
not
forget
the
oleanders
which
at
the
time
of
my
visit
were
in
full
flower
which
for
aught
i
know
may
be
in
full
flower
during
the
whole
year
they
are
so
general
through
all
the
islands
and
the
trees
themselves
are
so
covered
with
the
large
straggling
but
bright
blossoms
as
to
give
quite
a
character
to
the
scenery
the
bermudas
might
almost
be
called
the
oleander
isles
the
government
consists
of
a
governor
council
and
house
of
assembly
king
lords
and
commons
again
twenty
years
ago
i
should
thoroughly
have
approved
of
this
but
now
i
am
hardly
sure
whether
a
population
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
individuals
of
whom
much
more
than
half
are
women
and
more
than
half
the
remainder
are
negroes
require
so
composite
a
constitution
would
not
a
strict
governor
with
due
reference
to
downing
street
do
almost
as
well
but
then
to
make
the
change
that
would
be
difficulty
we
have
them
pretty
well
in
hand
a
gentleman
whispered
to
me
who
was
in
some
shape
connected
with
the
governing
powers
he
was
alluding
i
imagine
to
the
house
of
assembly
well
that
is
a
comfort
a
good
majority
in
the
lower
house
is
a
comfort
to
all
men
except
the
minority
there
are
nine
parishes
each
returning
four
members
to
this
house
of
assembly
but
though
every
parish
requires
four
members
i
observe
that
half
a
clergyman
is
enough
for
most
of
them
but
then
the
clergymen
must
be
paid
the
council
here
consists
chiefly
of
gentlemen
holding
government
offices
or
who
are
in
some
way
connected
with
the
government
so
that
the
crown
can
probably
contrive
to
manage
its
little
affairs
if
i
remember
rightly
gibraltar
and
malta
have
no
lords
or
commons
they
are
fortresses
and
as
such
under
military
rule
and
so
is
bermuda
a
fortress
independently
of
her
purely
military
importance
her
size
and
population
is
by
no
means
equal
to
that
of
malta
the
population
of
malta
is
chiefly
native
and
foreign
to
us
and
the
population
of
bermuda
is
chiefly
black
but
then
malta
is
a
conquered
colony
whereas
bermuda
was
settled
by
britons
as
the
word
goes
that
makes
all
the
difference
that
such
a
little
spot
as
bermuda
would
in
real
fact
be
better
without
a
constitution
of
its
own
if
the
change
could
only
be
managed
that
i
imagine
will
be
the
opinion
of
most
men
who
have
thought
about
the
matter
and
now
for
the
convict
establishment
i
received
great
kindness
and
hospitality
from
the
controller
of
it
but
this
luckily
does
not
prevent
my
speaking
freely
on
the
matter
he
had
only
just
then
newly
arrived
from
england
had
but
now
assumed
his
new
duties
and
was
therefore
neither
responsible
for
anything
that
was
amiss
or
entitled
to
credit
for
what
had
been
permanently
established
there
on
a
good
footing
my
own
impression
is
that
of
the
latter
there
was
very
little
in
these
days
our
penal
establishments
and
gaol
arrangements
generally
are
certainly
matters
of
very
vital
importance
to
us
in
olden
times
and
i
include
the
last
century
and
some
part
of
this
among
olden
times
we
certainly
did
not
manage
these
matters
well
our
main
object
then
was
to
get
rid
of
our
ruffians
to
punish
them
also
certainly
but
as
a
chief
matter
to
get
rid
of
them
the
idea
of
making
use
of
them
present
or
future
use
had
hardly
occurred
to
us
nor
had
we
begun
to
reflect
whether
the
roguery
of
coming
years
might
not
be
somewhat
lessened
by
curing
the
rogues
by
making
them
not
rogues
we
are
reflecting
a
good
deal
on
this
question
our
position
now
has
been
all
altered
circumstances
have
done
much
to
alter
it
we
can
no
longer
get
rid
of
the
worst
class
of
criminals
by
sending
them
to
botany
bay
botany
bay
has
assumed
a
will
of
its
own
and
wo
have
them
at
any
price
but
philanthropy
has
done
more
even
than
circumstances
very
much
more
we
have
the
will
the
determination
as
well
as
the
wish
to
do
well
by
our
rogues
even
if
we
have
not
as
yet
found
the
way
and
this
is
much
in
this
as
in
everything
else
the
way
will
follow
the
will
sooner
or
later
but
in
the
mean
time
we
have
been
trying
various
experiments
with
more
or
less
success
forgiving
men
half
their
terms
of
punishment
on
good
behaviour
giving
them
tickets
of
leave
solitary
confinement
pietising
what
may
be
called
a
system
of
gaol
sanctity
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
schemes
as
being
a
direct
advertisement
for
hypocrisy
work
without
result
the
most
distressing
punishment
going
one
may
say
next
to
that
of
no
work
at
all
enforced
idleness
which
is
horrible
for
human
nature
to
contemplate
work
with
result
work
which
shall
pay
good
living
pound
of
beef
pound
of
bread
pound
of
potatoes
ounce
of
tea
glass
of
grog
pipe
of
tobacco
resulting
in
much
fat
excellent
if
our
prisoners
were
stalled
oxen
to
be
eaten
poor
living
bread
and
water
which
has
its
recommendations
also
though
it
be
so
much
opposed
to
the
material
humanity
of
the
age
going
to
school
so
that
life
if
possible
may
be
made
to
recommence
very
good
also
if
life
would
recommence
corporal
punishment
flogging
of
the
body
horrible
to
think
of
impossible
to
be
looked
at
spirit
punishment
flogging
of
the
soul
best
of
all
if
one
could
get
at
the
soul
so
as
to
do
it
effectually
all
these
schemes
are
being
tried
and
as
i
believe
that
they
are
tried
with
an
honest
intent
to
arrive
at
that
which
is
best
so
also
do
i
believe
that
we
shall
in
time
achieve
that
which
is
if
not
heavenly
best
at
any
rate
terrestrially
good
shall
at
least
get
rid
certainly
of
all
that
is
hellishly
bad
at
present
however
we
are
still
groping
somewhat
uncertainly
let
us
try
for
a
moment
to
see
what
the
bermuda
groping
has
done
i
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
that
the
intention
here
also
has
been
good
the
intention
that
is
of
those
who
have
been
responsible
for
the
management
of
the
establishment
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
results
have
been
happy
at
bermuda
there
are
in
round
numbers
fifteen
hundred
convicts
as
this
establishment
is
one
of
penal
servitude
of
course
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
those
sent
there
are
either
hardened
thieves
whose
lives
have
been
used
to
crime
or
those
who
have
committed
heavy
offences
under
the
impulse
of
strong
temptation
in
dealing
with
such
men
i
think
we
have
three
things
to
do
firstly
to
rid
ourselves
of
them
from
amongst
us
as
we
do
of
other
nuisances
this
we
should
do
by
hanging
them
this
we
did
do
when
we
sent
them
to
botany
bay
this
we
certainly
do
when
we
send
them
to
bermuda
but
this
i
would
say
is
the
lightest
of
the
three
duties
the
second
is
with
reference
to
the
men
themselves
to
divest
them
if
by
any
means
it
may
be
possible
of
their
roguery
to
divest
them
even
of
a
little
of
their
roguery
if
so
much
as
that
can
be
done
to
teach
them
that
trite
lesson
of
honesty
being
the
best
policy
so
hard
for
men
to
learn
when
honesty
has
been
as
it
were
for
many
years
past
out
of
their
sight
and
even
beyond
their
understanding
this
is
very
important
but
even
this
is
not
the
most
important
the
third
and
most
important
object
is
the
punishment
of
these
men
their
punishment
sharp
hard
to
bear
heavy
to
body
and
mind
disagreeable
in
all
ways
to
be
avoided
on
account
of
its
odiousness
by
all
prudent
men
their
condign
punishment
so
that
the
world
at
large
may
know
and
see
and
clearly
acknowledge
even
the
uneducated
world
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
that
the
first
object
is
achieved
i
have
said
it
is
achieved
as
regards
those
fifteen
hundred
and
as
far
as
i
know
at
a
moderate
cost
useful
work
for
such
men
is
to
be
found
at
bermuda
we
have
dockyards
there
and
fortifications
which
can
not
be
made
too
strong
and
at
such
a
place
works
may
be
done
by
convict
labour
which
could
not
be
done
otherwise
whether
the
labour
be
economically
used
is
another
question
but
at
any
rate
the
fifteen
hundred
rogues
are
disposed
of
well
out
of
the
way
of
our
pockets
and
shop
windows
as
to
the
second
object
that
of
divesting
these
rogues
of
their
roguery
the
best
way
of
doing
that
is
the
question
as
to
which
there
is
at
the
present
moment
so
much
doubt
as
to
what
may
be
the
best
way
i
do
not
presume
to
give
an
opinion
but
i
do
presume
to
doubt
whether
the
best
way
has
as
yet
been
found
at
bermuda
the
proofs
at
any
rate
were
not
there
shortly
before
my
arrival
a
prisoner
had
been
killed
in
a
row
after
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
murder
a
warder
and
during
my
stay
there
one
prisoner
was
deliberately
murdered
by
two
others
after
a
faction
fight
between
a
lot
of
irish
and
english
in
which
the
warders
were
for
some
minutes
quite
unable
to
interfere
men
were
carried
to
the
hospital
dangerously
wounded
as
to
the
life
of
some
of
whom
the
doctor
almost
despaired
this
occurred
on
a
day
intervening
between
two
visits
which
i
made
to
the
establishment
within
a
month
of
the
same
time
three
men
had
escaped
of
whom
two
only
were
retaken
one
had
got
clear
away
probably
to
america
this
tells
little
for
the
discipline
and
very
little
for
the
moral
training
of
the
men
there
is
no
wall
round
the
prison
i
must
explain
that
the
convicts
are
kept
on
two
islands
those
called
boaz
and
ireland
at
boaz
is
the
parent
establishment
at
which
live
the
controller
chaplains
doctors
and
head
officers
but
here
is
the
lesser
number
of
prisoners
about
six
hundred
they
live
in
ordinary
prisons
the
other
nine
hundred
are
kept
in
two
hulks
old
moored
by
the
breakwaters
at
the
dockyard
establishment
in
ireland
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
the
murder
was
committed
the
labour
of
these
nine
hundred
men
is
devoted
to
the
dockyard
works
there
is
a
bridge
between
the
two
islands
over
which
runs
a
public
road
and
from
this
road
there
are
ways
equally
public
as
far
as
the
eye
goes
to
all
parts
of
the
prison
a
man
has
only
to
say
that
he
is
going
to
the
chaplain
house
and
he
may
pass
all
through
the
prison
with
spirits
in
his
pocket
if
it
so
please
him
that
the
prisoners
should
not
be
about
without
warders
is
no
doubt
a
prison
rule
but
where
everything
is
done
by
the
prisoners
from
the
building
of
stores
to
the
picking
of
weeds
and
lighting
of
lamps
how
can
any
moderate
number
of
warders
see
everything
even
if
they
were
inclined
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
spirits
being
smuggled
in
after
dark
through
the
prison
windows
and
the
men
do
get
rum
and
drunkenness
is
a
common
offence
prisoners
may
work
outside
prison
walls
but
i
remember
no
other
prison
that
is
not
within
walls
that
looks
from
open
windows
on
to
open
roads
as
is
here
the
case
and
who
shaves
them
i
happened
to
ask
one
of
the
officers
oh
every
man
has
his
own
razor
and
they
have
knives
too
though
it
is
not
allowed
so
these
gentlemen
who
are
always
ready
for
faction
fights
whose
minds
are
as
constantly
engaged
on
the
family
question
of
irish
english
which
means
protestant
against
catholic
as
were
those
of
father
tom
maguire
and
pope
are
as
well
armed
for
their
encounters
as
were
those
reverend
gentlemen
the
two
murderers
will
i
presume
be
tried
and
if
found
guilty
probably
hanged
but
the
usual
punishment
for
outbreaks
of
this
kind
seems
to
be
or
to
have
been
flogging
a
man
would
get
some
seventy
lashes
the
governor
of
the
island
would
go
down
and
see
it
done
and
then
the
lacerated
wretch
would
be
locked
up
in
idleness
till
his
back
would
again
admit
of
his
bearing
a
shirt
but
they
venture
their
skin
said
the
officer
they
do
mind
that
till
it
comes
but
do
they
mind
being
locked
up
alone
i
asked
he
admitted
this
but
said
that
they
had
only
six
i
think
six
cells
of
which
two
or
three
were
occupied
by
madmen
they
had
no
other
place
for
lunatics
solitary
confinement
is
what
these
men
do
mind
what
they
do
fear
but
here
there
is
not
the
power
of
inflicting
that
punishment
what
a
piece
of
work
for
a
man
to
step
down
upon
the
amendment
of
the
discipline
of
such
a
prison
as
this
think
what
the
feeling
among
them
will
be
when
knives
and
razors
are
again
taken
from
them
when
their
grog
is
first
stopped
their
liberty
first
controlled
they
sleep
together
a
hundred
or
more
within
talking
distance
in
hammocks
slung
at
arm
length
from
each
other
so
that
one
may
excite
ten
and
ten
fifty
is
it
fair
to
put
warders
among
such
men
so
well
able
to
act
so
ill
able
to
control
their
actions
it
is
a
sore
task
said
the
controller
who
had
fallen
down
new
upon
this
bit
of
work
it
is
dreadful
to
have
to
add
misery
to
those
who
are
already
miserable
it
is
a
very
sore
task
but
at
the
moment
i
hardly
sympathized
with
his
humanity
so
much
for
the
bermuda
practice
of
divesting
these
rogues
of
their
roguery
and
now
a
word
as
to
the
third
question
the
one
question
most
important
as
i
regard
it
of
their
punishment
are
these
men
so
punished
as
to
deter
others
by
the
fear
of
similar
treatment
i
presume
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
treatment
such
as
it
is
does
become
known
and
the
nature
of
it
understood
among
those
at
home
who
are
or
might
be
on
the
path
towards
it
among
the
lower
classes
from
which
these
convicts
do
doubtless
mostly
come
the
goods
of
life
are
chiefly
reckoned
as
being
food
clothing
warm
shelter
and
hours
of
idleness
it
may
seem
harsh
to
say
so
thus
plainly
but
will
any
philanthropical
lover
of
these
lower
classes
deny
the
fact
i
regard
myself
as
a
philanthropical
lover
of
those
classes
and
as
such
i
assert
the
fact
nay
i
might
go
further
and
say
that
it
is
almost
the
same
of
some
other
classes
that
many
have
knowledge
of
other
good
things
and
if
i
may
so
call
them
knowledge
of
and
also
i
do
not
deny
that
such
knowledge
is
greatly
on
the
increase
i
verily
believe
but
with
most
among
us
back
and
belly
or
rather
belly
and
back
are
still
supreme
on
belly
and
back
must
punishment
fall
when
sinners
such
as
these
are
to
be
punished
but
with
us
very
often
i
fear
elsewhere
but
certainly
at
that
establishment
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
there
is
no
such
punishment
at
all
in
scale
of
dietary
among
subjects
of
our
queen
i
should
say
that
honest
irish
labourers
stand
the
lowest
they
eat
meat
twice
a
year
potatoes
and
milk
for
six
months
potatoes
without
milk
for
six
and
fish
occasionally
if
near
the
shore
then
come
honest
english
labourers
they
generally
have
cheese
sometimes
bacon
next
above
them
we
may
probably
rank
the
inhabitants
of
our
workhouses
they
have
fresh
meat
perhaps
three
times
a
week
whom
shall
we
name
next
without
being
anxious
to
include
every
shade
of
english
mankind
we
may
say
soldiers
and
above
them
sailors
then
perhaps
ordinary
mechanics
there
must
be
many
another
ascending
step
before
we
come
to
the
bermuda
convict
but
it
would
be
long
to
name
them
but
now
let
us
see
what
the
bermuda
convict
eats
and
drinks
every
day
he
has
a
pound
of
meat
he
has
good
meat
too
lucky
dog
while
those
wretched
bermudians
are
tugging
out
their
teeth
against
tough
carcasses
he
has
a
pound
and
three
ounces
of
bread
the
amount
may
be
of
questionable
advantage
as
he
can
not
eat
it
all
but
he
probably
sells
it
for
drink
he
has
a
pound
of
fresh
vegetables
he
has
tea
and
sugar
he
has
a
glass
of
grog
exactly
the
same
amount
that
a
sailor
has
and
he
has
an
allowance
of
with
permission
to
smoke
at
midday
and
evening
as
he
sits
at
his
table
or
takes
his
noontide
pleasant
saunter
so
much
for
belly
then
as
to
back
under
which
i
include
a
man
sinews
the
convict
begins
the
day
by
going
to
chapel
at
a
seven
his
prayers
do
not
take
him
long
for
the
chaplain
on
the
occasion
of
my
visit
read
small
bits
out
of
the
here
and
there
without
any
reference
to
church
rule
or
reason
at
seven
he
goes
to
his
work
if
it
does
not
happen
to
rain
in
which
case
he
sits
till
it
ceases
he
then
works
till
five
with
an
hour
and
a
half
interval
for
his
dinner
grog
and
tobacco
he
then
has
the
evening
for
his
supper
and
amusements
he
thus
works
for
eight
hours
barring
the
rain
whereas
in
england
a
day
average
is
about
ten
as
to
the
comparative
hardness
of
their
labour
there
will
of
course
be
no
doubt
the
man
who
must
work
for
his
wages
will
not
get
any
wages
unless
he
works
hard
the
convict
will
at
any
rate
get
his
wages
and
of
course
spares
his
sinews
as
to
clothes
they
have
and
should
have
exactly
what
is
best
suited
to
health
shoes
when
worn
out
are
replaced
the
straw
hat
is
always
decent
and
just
what
one
would
wish
to
wear
oneself
in
that
climate
the
jacket
and
trousers
have
the
word
boaz
printed
over
them
in
rather
ugly
type
but
one
would
get
used
to
that
the
flannel
shirts
are
all
that
could
be
desired
their
beds
are
hammocks
like
those
of
sailors
only
not
subject
to
be
swung
about
by
the
winds
and
not
hung
quite
so
closely
as
those
of
some
sailors
did
any
of
my
readers
ever
see
the
beds
of
an
irish
cotters
establishment
in
county
cork
ah
or
of
some
english
establishments
in
dorsetshire
wiltshire
and
somersetshire
the
hospital
arrangements
and
attendance
are
excellent
as
regards
the
men
comfort
though
the
of
the
buildings
is
conspicuous
and
must
be
conspicuous
to
all
who
see
them
and
then
these
men
when
they
take
their
departure
have
the
wages
of
their
labour
given
to
them
so
much
as
they
have
not
spent
either
licitly
in
tobacco
or
illicitly
in
extra
grog
they
will
take
home
with
them
sixteen
pounds
eighteen
pounds
or
twenty
pounds
such
is
convict
life
in
bermuda
unless
a
man
chance
to
get
murdered
in
a
faction
fight
as
to
many
of
the
comforts
above
enumerated
it
will
of
course
be
seen
that
they
are
right
the
clothes
the
hospital
arrangements
and
sanitary
provision
are
and
should
be
better
in
a
prison
than
they
can
unfortunately
be
at
present
among
the
poor
who
are
not
prisoners
but
still
they
must
be
reckoned
among
the
advantages
which
convicted
crime
enjoy
it
seems
to
be
a
cruel
task
that
of
lessening
the
comforts
of
men
who
are
at
any
rate
in
truth
not
to
be
envied
are
to
be
pitied
rather
with
such
deep
deep
pity
but
the
thing
to
look
to
the
one
great
object
is
to
diminish
the
number
of
those
who
must
be
sent
to
such
places
will
such
back
and
belly
arrangements
as
those
i
have
described
deter
men
from
sin
by
the
fear
of
its
consequences
why
should
not
those
felons
for
such
they
all
are
i
presume
till
the
term
of
their
punishment
be
over
why
should
they
sleep
after
five
why
should
their
diet
be
more
than
strong
health
requires
why
should
their
hours
of
work
be
light
why
that
drinking
of
spirits
and
smoking
of
tobacco
among
men
whose
term
of
life
in
that
prison
should
be
a
term
of
suffering
why
those
long
twelve
hours
of
bed
and
rest
spent
in
each
other
company
with
noise
and
singing
and
jollity
let
them
eat
together
work
together
walk
together
if
you
will
but
surely
at
night
they
should
be
separated
faction
fights
can
not
take
place
unless
the
fighters
have
time
and
opportunity
to
arrange
them
i
can
not
but
think
that
there
should
be
great
changes
in
this
establishment
and
that
gradually
the
punishment
which
undoubtedly
is
intended
should
be
made
to
fall
on
the
prisoners
look
at
the
prisoners
rations
the
soldiers
say
in
bermuda
when
they
complain
of
their
own
and
who
can
answer
them
i
can
not
understand
why
the
island
governor
should
have
authority
in
the
prison
he
from
his
profession
can
know
little
or
nothing
about
prisons
and
even
for
his
own
work
or
no
work
is
generally
selected
either
from
personal
favour
or
from
military
motives
whereas
the
prison
governor
is
selected
probably
with
much
care
for
his
specialities
in
that
line
and
it
must
be
as
easy
and
as
quick
for
the
prison
governor
to
correspond
with
the
home
office
as
for
the
island
governor
to
correspond
with
the
colonial
office
there
has
undoubtedly
been
mischief
done
by
the
antagonism
of
different
authorities
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
all
such
establishments
should
be
exclusively
under
the
home
office
chapter
xxiii
conclusion
from
bermuda
i
took
a
sailing
vessel
to
new
york
in
company
with
a
rather
large
assortment
of
potatoes
and
onions
i
had
declared
during
my
unlucky
voyage
from
kingston
to
cuba
that
no
consideration
should
again
tempt
me
to
try
a
sailing
vessel
but
such
declarations
always
go
for
nothing
a
man
in
his
misery
thinks
much
of
his
misery
but
as
soon
as
he
is
out
of
it
it
is
forgotten
or
becomes
matter
for
mirth
of
even
a
voyage
in
a
sailing
vessel
one
may
say
that
at
some
future
time
it
will
perhaps
be
pleasant
to
remember
that
also
and
so
i
embarked
myself
along
with
the
potatoes
and
onions
on
board
the
good
ship
indeed
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
from
bermuda
to
new
york
or
of
going
anywhere
from
bermuda
except
to
halifax
and
thomas
to
which
places
a
steamer
runs
once
a
month
in
going
to
cuba
i
had
been
becalmed
starved
shipwrecked
and
very
nearly
quaranteened
in
going
to
new
york
i
encountered
only
the
last
misery
the
doctor
who
boarded
us
stated
that
a
vessel
had
come
from
bermuda
with
a
sick
man
and
that
we
must
remain
where
we
were
till
he
had
learnt
what
was
the
sick
man
ailment
our
skipper
who
knew
the
vessel
in
question
said
that
one
of
their
crew
had
been
drunk
in
bermuda
for
two
or
three
days
and
had
not
yet
worked
it
off
but
the
doctor
called
again
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
informed
us
that
it
was
intermittent
fever
so
we
were
allowed
to
pass
it
does
seem
strange
that
sailing
vessels
should
be
subjected
to
such
annoyances
i
hardly
think
that
one
of
the
mail
steamers
going
into
new
york
would
be
delayed
because
there
was
a
case
of
intermittent
fever
on
board
another
vessel
from
liverpool
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
give
an
englishman
ideas
of
the
united
states
or
even
of
new
york
at
the
fag
end
of
a
volume
treating
about
the
west
indies
on
the
united
states
i
should
like
to
write
a
volume
seeing
that
the
government
and
social
life
of
the
people
there
of
that
people
who
are
our
children
afford
the
most
interesting
phenomena
which
we
find
as
to
the
new
world
the
best
means
of
prophesying
if
i
may
say
so
what
the
world
will
next
be
and
what
men
will
next
do
there
at
any
rate
a
new
republic
has
become
politically
great
and
commercially
active
whereas
all
other
new
republics
have
failed
in
those
points
as
in
all
others
but
this
can
not
be
attempted
now
from
new
york
i
went
by
the
hudson
river
to
albany
and
on
by
the
new
york
central
railway
to
niagara
and
though
i
do
not
mean
to
make
any
endeavour
to
describe
that
latter
place
as
such
descriptions
should
be
and
doubtless
are
and
have
been
written
i
will
say
one
or
two
words
which
may
be
of
use
to
any
one
going
thither
the
route
which
i
took
from
new
york
would
be
i
should
think
the
most
probable
route
for
englishmen
and
as
travellers
will
naturally
go
up
the
hudson
river
by
day
and
then
on
from
albany
by
night
train
seeing
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
at
albany
and
that
these
trains
have
excellent
sleeping
accommodation
a
lady
or
indeed
a
gentleman
should
always
take
a
double
a
single
one
costs
half
a
dollar
and
a
double
one
a
dollar
this
outlay
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
travelling
ticket
it
will
follow
that
he
she
or
they
will
reach
niagara
at
about
would
be
well
however
to
visit
trenton
falls
by
the
way
which
i
did
not
do
they
are
but
a
short
distance
from
utica
a
town
on
this
line
of
railway
in
that
case
let
them
not
go
on
to
what
is
called
the
niagara
falls
station
but
pass
over
at
a
station
called
the
suspension
bridge
very
well
known
on
the
road
to
the
other
or
canada
side
of
the
water
and
thence
go
to
the
clifton
hotel
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
this
being
the
site
at
which
tourists
should
stop
it
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
to
see
is
to
be
sure
but
if
the
traveller
be
carried
on
to
niagara
falls
station
he
has
a
long
and
expensive
journey
to
make
back
and
the
united
states
side
of
the
water
will
be
antagonistic
to
him
in
doing
so
the
ticket
from
albany
to
niagara
cost
me
six
dollars
the
carriage
from
niagara
to
the
clifton
hotel
cost
me
five
it
was
better
to
pay
the
five
than
to
remain
where
i
was
but
it
would
have
been
better
still
to
have
saved
them
i
mention
this
as
passengers
to
the
falls
have
no
sort
of
intimation
that
they
should
get
out
at
the
suspension
bridge
though
they
are
all
duly
shaken
out
of
their
berths
and
inquired
of
whether
or
not
they
be
going
west
nothing
ever
disappointed
me
less
than
the
falls
of
niagara
but
my
raptures
did
not
truly
commence
for
the
first
their
charms
grow
upon
one
like
the
conversation
of
a
brilliant
man
their
depth
and
breadth
and
altitude
their
music
colour
and
brilliancy
are
not
fully
acknowledged
at
the
first
moment
it
may
be
that
my
eye
is
slow
but
i
can
never
take
in
to
its
full
enjoyment
any
view
or
any
picture
at
the
first
glance
i
found
this
to
be
especially
the
case
at
niagara
it
was
only
by
long
gazing
and
long
listening
that
i
was
able
to
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
that
waste
of
waters
my
book
is
now
complete
and
i
am
not
going
to
do
the
falls
but
i
must
bid
such
of
my
readers
as
may
go
there
to
place
themselves
between
the
rocks
and
the
waters
of
the
fall
after
sunset
well
after
sunset
and
there
remain
say
for
half
an
hour
and
let
every
man
do
this
alone
or
if
fortune
have
kindly
given
him
such
a
companion
with
one
who
may
leave
him
as
good
as
alone
but
such
companions
are
rare
the
spot
to
which
i
allude
will
easily
make
itself
known
to
him
nor
will
he
have
any
need
of
a
guide
he
will
find
it
of
course
before
the
sun
shall
set
and
indeed
as
to
guides
let
him
eschew
them
giving
a
cent
piece
here
and
there
so
that
these
men
be
not
ruined
for
want
of
custom
into
this
spot
i
made
my
way
and
stood
there
for
an
hour
dry
enough
the
spray
did
reach
my
coat
and
the
drops
settled
on
my
hair
but
nevertheless
as
a
man
not
over
delicate
i
was
dry
enough
then
i
went
up
and
when
there
was
enticed
to
put
myself
into
a
filthy
dress
hat
coat
and
trousers
in
order
that
i
might
be
conducted
under
the
falls
under
the
falls
well
i
had
been
under
the
falls
but
still
wishing
to
see
everything
i
allowed
myself
to
be
caparisoned
a
sable
conductor
took
me
exactly
to
the
spot
where
i
had
been
before
but
he
took
me
also
ten
yards
further
during
which
little
extra
journey
i
became
soaking
wet
through
in
spite
of
the
dirty
the
ducking
cost
me
sixty
cents
or
half
a
crown
but
i
must
be
allowed
one
word
as
to
that
visit
after
sunset
one
word
as
to
that
which
an
obedient
tourist
will
then
see
in
the
spot
to
which
i
allude
the
visitor
stands
on
a
broad
safe
path
made
of
shingles
between
the
rock
over
which
the
water
rushes
and
the
rushing
water
he
will
go
in
so
far
that
the
spray
rising
back
from
the
bed
of
the
torrent
does
not
incommode
him
with
this
exception
the
further
he
can
go
the
better
but
here
also
circumstances
will
clearly
show
him
the
spot
unless
the
water
be
driven
in
by
a
very
strong
wind
five
yards
make
the
difference
between
a
comparatively
dry
coat
and
an
absolutely
wet
one
and
then
let
him
stand
with
his
back
to
the
entrance
thus
hiding
the
last
glimmer
of
the
expiring
day
so
standing
he
will
look
up
among
the
falling
waters
or
down
into
the
deep
misty
pit
from
which
they
reascend
in
almost
as
palpable
a
bulk
the
rock
will
be
at
his
right
hand
high
and
hard
and
dark
and
straight
like
the
wall
of
some
huge
cavern
such
as
children
enter
in
their
dreams
for
the
first
five
minutes
he
will
be
looking
but
at
the
waters
of
a
cataract
at
the
waters
indeed
of
such
a
cataract
as
we
know
no
other
and
at
their
interior
curves
which
elsewhere
we
can
not
see
but
all
this
will
change
he
will
no
longer
be
on
a
shingly
path
beneath
a
waterfall
but
that
feeling
of
a
cavern
wall
will
grow
upon
him
of
a
cavern
deep
deep
below
roaring
seas
in
which
the
waves
are
there
though
they
do
not
enter
in
upon
him
or
rather
not
the
waves
but
the
very
bowels
of
the
deep
ocean
he
will
feel
as
though
the
floods
surrounded
him
coming
and
going
with
their
wild
sounds
and
he
will
hardly
recognize
that
though
among
them
he
is
not
in
them
and
they
as
they
fall
with
a
continual
roar
not
hurting
the
ear
but
musical
withal
will
seem
to
move
as
the
vast
ocean
waters
may
perhaps
move
in
their
internal
currents
he
will
lose
the
sense
of
one
continued
descent
and
think
that
they
are
passing
round
him
in
their
appointed
courses
the
broken
spray
that
rises
from
the
depth
below
rises
so
strongly
so
palpably
so
rapidly
that
the
motion
in
every
direction
will
seem
equal
and
then
as
he
looks
on
strange
colours
will
show
themselves
through
the
mist
the
shades
of
gray
will
become
green
and
blue
with
ever
and
anon
a
flash
of
white
and
then
when
some
gust
of
wind
blows
in
with
greater
violence
the
cavern
will
become
all
dark
and
black
oh
my
friend
let
there
be
no
one
there
to
speak
to
thee
then
no
not
even
a
heart
brother
as
you
stand
there
speak
only
to
the
waters
so
much
for
niagara
from
thence
i
went
along
lake
ontario
and
by
the
lawrence
to
montreal
being
desirous
of
seeing
the
new
tubular
railway
bridge
which
is
being
erected
there
over
the
lawrence
close
to
that
town
lake
ontario
is
uninteresting
being
altogether
too
large
for
scenery
and
too
foggy
for
if
there
were
anything
to
see
the
travelling
accommodation
however
is
excellent
the
points
of
interest
in
the
lawrence
are
the
thousand
islands
among
which
the
steamer
glides
as
soon
as
it
enters
the
river
and
the
rapids
of
which
the
most
singularly
rapid
is
the
one
the
vessel
descends
as
it
nears
montreal
both
of
these
are
very
well
but
they
do
not
require
to
be
raved
about
the
canadian
towns
at
which
one
touches
are
interesting
as
being
clean
and
large
and
apparently
prosperous
also
as
being
english
for
we
hardly
reach
the
french
part
of
canada
till
we
get
down
to
montreal
this
tubular
bridge
over
the
lawrence
which
will
complete
the
whole
trunk
line
of
railway
from
portland
on
the
coast
of
maine
through
the
two
canadas
to
the
states
of
michigan
and
wisconsin
will
certainly
be
one
of
the
most
wonderful
works
of
scientific
art
in
the
world
it
is
to
consist
of
different
tubes
resting
on
piers
placed
in
the
river
bed
at
intervals
sufficient
to
provide
for
the
free
navigation
of
the
water
some
of
these
including
the
centre
and
largest
one
are
already
erected
this
bridge
will
be
over
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
and
will
cost
the
enormous
sum
of
one
million
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
being
but
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
short
of
the
whole
cost
of
the
panama
railway
i
only
wish
that
the
shareholders
may
have
as
good
a
dividend
from
montreal
i
went
down
lake
champlain
to
saratoga
springs
the
great
resort
of
new
yorkers
when
the
weather
in
the
city
becomes
too
hot
for
endurance
i
was
there
late
in
june
but
was
very
glad
at
that
time
to
sit
with
my
toes
over
a
fire
the
country
about
saratoga
is
by
no
means
pretty
the
waters
i
do
not
doubt
are
very
healthy
and
the
hotels
very
good
it
must
i
should
think
be
a
very
dull
place
for
persons
who
are
not
invalids
from
saratoga
i
returned
to
new
york
and
from
new
york
sailed
for
liverpool
in
the
exceedingly
good
ship
captain
shannon
i
have
sailed
in
many
vessels
but
never
in
one
that
was
more
comfortable
or
better
found
and
on
board
this
most
comfortable
of
vessels
i
have
now
finished
my
book
as
i
began
it
on
board
that
one
of
all
the
most
uncomfortable
which
carried
me
from
kingston
in
jamaica
to
cien
fuegos
in
the
island
of
cuba
