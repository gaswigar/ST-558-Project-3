there
are
those
who
have
asked
me
to
write
this
book
there
may
be
others
who
shall
question
me
because
i
have
written
it
assuredly
these
will
cry
out
it
is
justly
forbidden
to
ascribe
words
and
deeds
of
one
s
own
devising
to
them
which
have
been
set
forever
apart
in
the
pages
of
the
book
of
books
the
pen
of
inspiration
has
written
of
stephen
all
that
god
wills
us
to
know
of
him
therefore
let
us
be
content
it
is
true
that
the
story
of
stephen
is
little
known
scarcely
for
a
single
day
does
the
light
shine
clearly
upon
him
and
that
day
the
last
of
his
mortal
life
a
tale
is
told
of
ancient
alchemists
how
that
they
possessed
the
power
of
resurrecting
from
the
ashes
of
a
perished
flower
a
dim
ghost
of
the
flower
itself
in
like
manner
may
not
one
gather
the
fragrant
dust
of
this
vanished
life
from
out
the
writings
and
legends
of
past
ages
and
from
it
build
anew
some
faint
image
of
its
forgotten
beauty
surely
in
these
days
when
the
imagination
hurries
to
and
fro
on
the
earth
delving
amid
all
that
is
low
and
evil
and
noisome
for
some
new
panacea
wherewith
to
deaden
if
only
for
a
moment
the
feverish
pain
in
the
hearts
of
men
it
were
a
good
thing
to
lift
up
the
eyes
of
the
soul
to
the
contemplation
of
those
days
when
the
memory
of
the
living
jesus
was
yet
fresh
in
the
hearts
of
his
followers
when
his
voice
still
echoed
in
their
ears
when
the
glory
of
the
cloud
which
had
received
him
out
of
their
sight
lingered
with
transfiguring
splendor
on
all
the
commonplace
happenings
of
their
daily
lives
when
the
words
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
meant
a
living
presence
all
comforting
all
powerful
we
are
wont
to
look
longingly
back
through
the
dark
mists
of
the
ages
and
sigh
oh
that
i
had
known
him
as
they
knew
him
but
in
these
hard
grey
days
there
is
no
glory
that
shines
no
voice
that
speaks
no
ecstatic
vision
of
the
son
of
man
standing
at
the
right
hand
of
power
yet
had
we
lived
in
those
days
the
life
which
many
of
us
live
going
to
church
and
to
prayer
because
such
attendance
is
a
christian
duty
giving
of
our
abundance
to
the
poor
because
our
neighbors
will
marvel
if
we
withhold
and
for
the
rest
living
as
those
before
the
flood
and
since
also
eating
and
drinking
and
making
such
poor
merriment
as
we
are
able
in
a
life
which
was
given
us
for
another
purpose
had
we
lived
thus
in
those
days
would
the
pentecostal
flames
have
descended
upon
us
could
the
crucified
one
have
said
unto
us
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
would
we
not
rather
have
cried
out
in
terror
and
fled
away
from
the
light
of
those
sad
eyes
into
darkness
even
as
did
peter
after
that
he
had
denied
with
curses
there
is
an
apostolic
church
in
the
world
christ
is
on
earth
and
walks
with
men
the
spirit
works
mightily
as
of
old
the
blind
see
the
deaf
hear
and
the
dead
are
raised
up
but
it
is
not
alone
in
splendid
temple
nor
amid
the
solemn
pomp
of
churchly
magnificence
that
these
things
are
being
accomplished
but
in
the
humble
upper
rooms
where
the
good
soldiers
of
the
salvation
army
and
the
workers
in
rescue
missions
labor
unceasingly
for
them
that
are
lost
in
these
places
and
in
the
silence
of
repentant
hearts
also
one
may
yet
touch
the
borders
of
that
seamless
robe
and
lo
every
one
that
touches
is

bounteous

father
of

garlanded
with

blooms
rosy
as
horus
as
these
words
rang
out
over
the
rocky
hillside
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
two
men
who
were
climbing
the
steep
declivity
paused
a
moment
and
looked
at
each
other
that
is
the
voice
said
one
of
them
in
a
tone
of
deep
satisfaction
a
voice
of
gold
truly
if
only
breathed
forth
into
royal
ears
there
are
two
of
them
said
his
companion
wiping
his
hot
face
the
other
is
a
boy
a
good
he
also
will
bring
a
fair
price
valuable
property
both
and
going
to
waste
like
water
spilled
in
the
desert
why
buy
slaves
for
gold
when
they
grow
wild
in
the
desert
and
the
speaker
laughed
under
his
breath
thou
art
a
favorite
of
the
gods
said
the
other
with
a
venomous
gleam
in
his
narrow
black
eyes
in
thy
wisdom
forget
not
that
it
was
i
who
came
upon
the
two
nesting
in
a
corner
of
yonder
old
tomb
like
a
pair
of
swallows
thou
shalt
have
the
boy
and
who
gave
thee
leave
to
say
friend
canst
thou
sell
them
then
is
it
of
thee
that
the
princess
will
buy
slaves
half
the
price
of
the
two
shall
be
thine
if
that
pleaseth
thee
not
why
then
look
at
me
i
am
thy
sister
that
loveth
thee
do
not
stay
far
from
me
heavenly
one
come
to
thine
abode
with
haste
with
haste
i
see
thee
no
more
i
see
thee
no
more
trilled
the
unseen
singer
ha
the
song
of
isis
the
little
one
is
religious
continued
the
speaker
who
had
stopped
in
the
midst
of
his
bargaining
come
what
sayest
thou
he
added
persuasively
half
the
price
and
it
will
be
a
good
one
no
one
can
do
better
in
such
a
matter
than
no
one
better
than
besa
interrupted
the
other
rudely
be
it
so
but
lie
to
me
about
the
price
and
thou
shalt
regret
it
the
two
had
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
by
this
time
hist
do
not
let
her
see
thee
nay
rather
do
not
let
her
hear
thee
she
is
blind
blind
ay
stone
blind
but
what
matters
it
when
she
carries
a
singing
bird
in
her
throat
do
they
not
blind
the
nightingale
both
men
now
advanced
cautiously
their
sandaled
feet
making
little
sound
on
the
plateau
upon
which
yawned
several
recesses
cut
deep
into
the
solid
rock
in
the
door
of
one
of
these
recesses
sat
or
rather
crouched
the
figure
of
a
young
girl
her
hair
gathered
away
from
her
forehead
and
plaited
in
several
thick
braids
revealed
a
thin
face
delicately
featured
the
smooth
brown
cheeks
faintly
flushed
with
a
warmth
which
in
the
drooping
mouth
deepened
to
scarlet
her
eyes
were
large
and
black
but
curiously
expressionless
like
the
eyes
of
the
great
god
ptah
in
the
temple
below
for
the
rest
she
was
dressed
in
the
shapeless
blue
linen
robe
of
an
egyptian
peasant
woman
about
her
neck
hung
a
string
of
shining
coins
and
upon
the
slender
ankles
tinkled
hoops
of
wrought
silver
at
the
sound
of
the
stealthy
feet
upon
the
rock
the
blind
girl
bent
her
head
anxiously
is
it
you
seth
she
said
doubtfully
nay
little
one
said
one
of
the
men
advancing
boldly
it
is
only
a
wayfarer
who
heard
a
goddess
chanting
to
herself
in
a
nook
of
the
mountain
didst
thou
also
hear
it
the
girl
shrank
back
into
the
narrow
recess
upon
whose
rocky
walls
was
pictured
gaudily
the
career
of
its
former
occupant
she
made
no
reply
this
dismal
tomb
is
no
place
for
thee
continued
the
speaker
in
honeyed
tones
for
it
is
thou
and
no
other
who
hast
the
voice
of
isis
herself
thou
shouldst
sing
in
the
abode
of
princes
and
be
crowned
with
perfumed
garlands
and
all
this
shall
shortly
happen
if
thou
wilt
but
come
with
me
listen
he
added
imperatively
in
the
greek
tongue
addressing
his
companion
i
will
take
the
girl
with
me
her
pretty
face
adds
to
her
value
by
half
the
blindness
is
no
matter
but
do
thou
wait
for
the
boy
and
bring
him
to
the
city
to
the
place
whereof
thou
knowest
they
shall
both
be
sold
he
was
standing
as
he
spoke
perilously
near
the
edge
of
the
rocky
declivity
up
which
he
had
just
clambered
his
black
snaky
eyes
fixed
upon
the
maiden
his
hand
already
extended
to
grasp
her
when
with
the
lithe
swiftness
of
a
tigress
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
with
a
sudden
powerful
push
of
her
strong
young
arms
sent
the
unfortunate
man
flying
backward
over
the
verge
then
with
a
loud
scream
she
turned
and
eluding
the
outstretched
arms
of
the
other
fled
away
and
disappeared
in
some
hidden
nook
among
the
tombs
the
man
who
remained
behind
stared
after
her
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
broke
into
a
short
sneering
laugh
by
the
seven
great
gods
it
appears
that
a
nightingale
is
not
easy
to
cage
and
what
then
has
become
of
our
bargaining
besa
by
anubis
i
care
not
if
he
be
dead
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
he
presently
descried
a
motionless
mass
of
dingy
red
drapery
lodged
against
the
side
of
a
great
boulder
and
thither
grumbling
morosely
to
himself
he
slowly
and
deliberately
made
his
way
in
the
meantime
the
young
girl
was
cowering
breathless
in
a
narrow
crevice
of
the
rocks
she
listened
intensely
her
hands
upon
her
heart
as
though
she
feared
that
its
loud
beating
might
betray
her
but
after
a
few
moments
the
silence
reassured
her
and
she
began
to
weep
and
moan
softly
to
herself
o
isis
one
what
is
it
that
hath
befallen
me
o
god
of
the
sun
in
thy
shining
chariot
why
dost
thou
not
smite
such
wickedness
what
then
if
i
have
killed
him
nay
i
care
not
it
is
just
anat
anat
shouted
a
voice
where
art
thou
ah
it
is
seth
said
the
girl
rising
to
her
feet
hist
here
am
i
why
art
thou
here
said
the
newcomer
anxiously
what
hath
happened
by
way
of
answer
the
girl
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobbing
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
tearing
at
her
black
braids
the
lad
stared
at
her
in
amazement
and
fear
then
hastily
casting
aside
the
skin
with
its
tinkling
brass
cups
which
he
carried
upon
his
back
he
knelt
down
by
the
convulsed
little
figure
and
throwing
one
arm
about
it
began
to
speak
in
low
soothing
tones
anat
little
sister
come
tell
me
what
hath
happened
thou
must
indeed
little
one
i
should
not
have
left
thee
alone
thou
hast
been
frightened
is
it
not
so
thus
encouraged
the
blind
girl
finally
managed
to
tell
her
story
albeit
in
disjointed
half
intelligible
words
he
heard
thee
singing
little
one
said
her
brother
knitting
his
black
brows
angrily
and
would
have
carried
thee
away
like
a
bird
yes
said
the
girl
fiercely
but
that
is
not
all
he
said
that
we
should
both
be
sold
yet
it
may
be
that
he
will
not
care
for
buying
and
selling
on
the
morrow
i
know
not
how
i
could
have
done
it
but
of
a
sudden
i
felt
a
great
strength
come
upon
me
i
pushed
him
over
the
ledge
i
heard
him
fall
and
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
quick
shudder
and
thou
didst
well
little
one
said
the
boy
it
matters
not
what
hath
befallen
him
the
gods
helped
thee
but
the
other
there
were
two
saidst
thou
he
will
return
we
must
get
us
away
from
here
and
at
once
where
shall
we
go
said
anat
plaintively
we
are
even
as
the
birds
that
flee
before
the
hunter
only
to
fall
at
last
into
his
hand
not
so
little
one
the
pursued
eaglets
flee
away
into
the
desert
so
also
will
we
i
know
of
a
secure
and
thou
shalt
not
again
stay
alone
shall
we
go
now
yes
now
when
i
shall
have
gathered
together
our
possessions
but
they
be
few
it
will
not
take
long
the
lad
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
sigh
and
looked
out
and
away
from
their
lofty
eyrie
far
below
them
lay
a
floor
of
shining
the
fertile
plains
of
the
nile
shadowed
here
and
there
with
groups
of
clustered
palm
trees
through
the
midst
of
these
plains
rolled
the
sacred
river
like
a
flood
of
gold
on
either
side
of
it
rose
the
white
walls
and
strange
towers
of
the
city
of
memphis
all
transfigured
in
the
shining
mist
of
the
setting
sun
and
beyond
trooped
the
grim
procession
of
the
pyramids
solemn
sentinels
on
the
borders
of
a
desert
which
the
egyptians
thought
to
be
boundless
behind
whose
golden
rim
they
believed
lay
the
regions
of
the
departed
chapter
ii
good
tidings
out
of
the
desert
i
hear
some
one
coming
how
can
that
be
anat
i
see
no
one
it
matters
not
there
is
some
one
i
can
hear
the
tinkle
of
the
harness
bells
it
is
from
the
desert
they
come
a
caravan
thinkest
thou
little
one
said
seth
looking
with
an
indulgent
smile
at
the
flushed
face
with
its
strange
dark
eyes
nay
said
the
girl
after
a
pause
shaking
her
head
decidedly
there
is
but
one
one
on
a
swift
dromedary
by
horus
thou
art
right
i
see
the
man
now
he
is
coming
this
way
and
shaking
his
tinkling
cups
the
lad
darted
away
to
meet
the
traveler
water
fresh
cool
water
the
gift
of
god
to
the
thirsty
he
cried
aloud
and
the
stranger
scorched
by
the
withering
breath
of
the
desert
gladly
dismounted
and
drank
deep
of
the
proffered
cup
god
grant
thee
peace
whoever
thou
art
he
said
in
a
low
deep
voice
turning
his
piercing
eyes
upon
the
boy
how
doth
it
chance
that
thou
art
here
in
the
desert
surely
not
many
come
this
way
why
art
thou
not
rather
plying
thy
trade
in
yonder
city
he
felt
in
his
wallet
for
a
coin
as
he
spoke
the
boy
flushed
deeply
and
hung
his
head
without
answering
it
is
a
happy
chance
for
me
that
thou
hadst
the
desert
traveler
in
thy
thought
continued
the
stranger
with
a
smile
of
singular
sweetness
for
i
could
no
longer
abide
the
brackish
water
of
the
march
and
was
pushing
ahead
of
the
caravan
with
all
possible
speed
for
a
draught
from
a
certain
cool
fountain
that
i
know
not
far
from
here
the
fountain
of
kera
said
the
boy
looking
up
even
so
and
it
is
of
that
i
have
just
drunken
ay
i
thought
so
though
it
is
many
moons
since
i
have
tasted
it
stroking
his
long
beard
thoughtfully
the
stranger
continued
i
shall
wait
here
now
till
the
others
come
up
it
will
not
be
long
who
sits
yonder
in
the
shadow
of
the
rock
my
sister
replied
the
lad
briefly
she
is
blind
he
added
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
blind
ah
the
pity
of
it
the
pity
of
it
said
the
man
passing
his
hand
swiftly
across
his
eyes
would
to
god
then
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
commanded
his
dromedary
to
lie
down
the
beast
obeyed
moaning
and
shaking
his
head
he
also
smells
water
yet
hath
he
drunken
his
fill
yester
eve
be
quiet
neha
thou
shalt
again
and
the
little
one
is
blind
yes
but
she
hath
wonderful
hearing
said
seth
proudly
she
heard
the
tinkle
of
thy
harness
bells
before
i
saw
thee
yes
yes
i
know
no
one
better
it
was
once
so
with
me
but
seeing
is
also
good
thanks
be
to
the
wonderful
the
prophet
of
israel
i
know
that
now
the
lad
looked
at
the
man
in
puzzled
silence
they
had
now
approached
the
great
rock
in
the
shadow
of
which
the
blind
girl
was
sitting
greetings
to
thee
little
one
said
the
stranger
sitting
down
in
the
sand
near
the
child
and
looking
earnestly
into
her
dark
sightless
eyes
who
is
it
that
is
speaking
to
me
do
not
fear
anat
i
am
here
said
seth
quietly
possessing
himself
of
one
of
the
slender
brown
hands
i
am
not
afraid
the
voice
is
good
where
dwellest
thou
continued
the
stranger
we
are
even
as
the
wild
goats
of
the
desert
said
the
boy
bitterly
wandering
among
the
rocks
by
day
and
at
night
sleeping
where
the
night
overtakes
us
surely
thou
art
not
alone
in
the
world
urged
the
stranger
thy
parents
where
are
they
the
nile
hath
risen
seven
times
now
since
they
passed
into
the
regions
of
the
dead
said
anat
raising
her
drooping
head
many
passed
with
them
by
reason
of
a
great
sickness
i
also
was
stricken
and
afterward
mine
eyes
were
darkened
not
suddenly
but
slowly
even
as
the
evening
deepens
into
the
black
night
it
is
always
night
now
ah
yes
said
the
stranger
sighing
a
night
wherein
one
hath
strange
dreams
and
where
fear
standeth
by
the
pillow
of
sleep
and
walks
always
at
the
right
hand
in
the
waking
hours
and
thou
alone
carest
for
the
little
one
he
continued
fixing
his
keen
eyes
upon
the
boy
i
alone
said
the
boy
proudly
we
dwelt
among
yonder
hills
and
i
plied
my
trade
in
the
city
below
but
here
he
checked
himself
suddenly
and
looked
suspiciously
at
his
questioner
wilt
thou
not
break
thy
fast
he
said
at
length
thou
art
our
guest
the
stranger
bowed
his
head
gravely
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
as
he
did
so
he
understood
then
seth
made
haste
and
fetched
from
a
neighboring
crevice
in
the
rock
dates
and
parched
corn
together
with
a
gourd
of
water
their
guest
ate
of
the
food
the
lad
also
and
the
maiden
i
was
blind
said
the
stranger
at
length
rising
and
i
was
healed
of
my
blindness
by
the
great
prophet
of
israel
they
call
him
jesus
where
dwells
he
in
jerusalem
far
away
beyond
the
wilderness
and
he
pointed
towards
the
desert
from
which
he
had
just
come
dost
thou
return
thither
not
many
days
hence
when
i
shall
have
sold
my
goods
and
loaded
my
camels
i
shall
not
forget
thy
hospitality
when
i
again
pass
this
way
fetch
me
water
my
son
and
hear
what
i
shall
say
to
thee
maiden
i
salute
thee
farewell
and
he
sprang
upon
his
beast
and
was
gone
in
a
swift
cloud
of
dust
toward
the
caravan
which
crawled
like
a
snake
over
the
yellow
wastes
of
the
desert
seth
did
not
run
with
his
and
his
tinkling
cups
to
meet
them
as
was
his
wont
he
sat
silent
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
rock
thinking
anat
also
was
silent
for
a
time
then
she
said
timidly
i
would
that
i
too
might
see
the
man
of
blessing
he
who
dwells
beyond
the
wilderness
and
hath
power
to
restore
sight
to
the
blind
there
is
no
one
in
the
land
of
egypt
who
can
do
the
like
we
have
no
treasure
to
give
him
would
he
not
say
to
us
where
then
is
thy
gold
or
thy
precious
stones
or
thy
beasts
of
burden
before
i
shall
do
this
thing
for
thee
thou
knowest
not
the
ways
of
magicians
i
know
for
i
have
heard
yet
is
there
no
magician
in
all
egypt
who
can
cure
blindness
anat
sighed
i
have
my
mother
s
necklace
she
said
at
length
laying
her
hand
upon
the
string
of
coins
about
her
neck
some
of
them
are
of
gold
and
very
heavy
then
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
half
sob
the
men
yesterday
they
would
have
sold
us
i
yes
i
would
be
a
slave
if
only
i
might
see
i
will
be
a
slave
and
thou
shalt
have
thine
eyes
together
with
thy
freedom
cried
seth
starting
to
his
feet
i
will
say
to
the
man
give
thou
sight
to
these
eyes
and
i
am
thy
bondman
from
henceforth
and
forever
i
will
serve
thee
with
my
heart
s
blood
i
also
will
serve
him
for
i
will
not
leave
thee
my
brother
but
how
shall
we
pass
the
wilderness
there
are
many
caravans
passing
through
said
the
lad
looking
with
troubled
eyes
into
the
distance
but
the
way
is
long
and
we
have
no
beast
the
stranger
who
ate
of
our
bread
will
he
not
take
us
to
that
far
country
it
may
be
began
seth
then
he
stopped
suddenly
anat
had
grasped
his
arm
convulsively
her
face
pallid
to
the
lips
the
voices
she
gasped
i
hear
them
they
will
sell
us
into
bondage
let
us
hide
quick
without
a
word
the
lad
hurried
her
into
a
narrow
cleft
in
the
rocks
not
far
distant
here
tugging
with
all
his
strength
at
a
broad
stone
which
was
half
buried
in
the
drifting
sand
he
at
length
succeeded
in
pulling
it
aside
the
opening
disclosed
a
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
solid
rock
winding
down
into
impenetrable
darkness
from
the
depths
there
ascended
a
stifling
odor
of
resin
and
spices
the
girl
drew
back
gasping
not
here
she
said
faintly
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
go
further
it
is
the
breath
of
the
dead
the
lad
hesitated
an
instant
he
too
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
tinkling
of
harness
bells
listen
he
whispered
i
know
not
the
voices
but
thou
knowest
yes
yes
it
is
the
voice
i
will
go
anywhere
to
escape
the
tinkling
sound
and
the
slow
steps
of
the
beasts
of
burden
became
momently
louder
together
with
the
harsh
tones
of
a
human
voice
tis
a
fool
s
errand
besa
thou
hast
lost
what
little
wit
the
gods
gave
thee
in
thy
tumble
of
yesterday
by
sechet
i
have
not
yet
done
laughing
to
think
of
the
way
the
little
served
thee
who
could
know
that
the
beggar
understood
greek
pooh
that
is
nothing
no
one
better
than
the
beggars
they
whine
for
every
man
s
gold
in
his
own
tongue
ha
ha
thou
shouldst
have
perfumed
garlands
saidst
thou
with
tongue
as
smooth
as
sesame
oil
then
i
saw
only
a
flying
bundle
of
red
cloth
besa
was
gone
ha
ha
why
didst
thou
not
seize
her
fool
snarled
the
other
grinding
his
teeth
i
will
find
her
should
i
look
a
lifetime
if
only
to
twist
that
little
singing
throat
of
hers
that
shalt
thou
not
do
friend
that
singing
throat
is
gold
and
it
is
mine
come
we
will
go
back
they
are
not
here
what
is
this
said
besa
triumphantly
dismounting
from
his
ass
and
holding
up
a
brilliant
bit
of
striped
drapery
this
or
one
like
it
was
on
the
girl
s
neck
yesterday
amu
for
so
was
the
other
man
called
made
no
reply
he
was
looking
fixedly
into
a
narrow
cleft
of
the
rocks
presently
he
too
dismounted
some
one
has
been
here
he
said
pointing
to
the
fresh
footmarks
in
the
sand
which
had
drifted
deep
into
the
opening
chapter
iii
at
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
it
is
well
that
by
the
blessing
of
jehovah
thou
hast
recovered
thy
health
my
son
for
though
we
have
accomplished
the
death
of
the
blasphemer
there
yet
remains
the
rabble
of
his
followers
with
the
trunk
of
the
poisonous
vine
we
must
also
thoroughly
burn
the
branches
lest
they
bud
anew
thou
hast
the
tongue
of
wisdom
said
caiaphas
in
a
tone
of
dull
indifference
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
on
the
range
of
blue
hills
at
the
verge
of
the
horizon
annas
glanced
impatiently
at
the
white
worn
face
they
are
already
spreading
reports
both
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
galilee
that
the
man
is
alive
again
that
forsooth
he
has
been
seen
of
them
the
temple
resounds
daily
to
the
voice
of
their
noisome
praises
and
thanksgivings
i
have
counseled
that
they
be
thrust
out
he
continued
frowning
for
what
is
it
else
than
blasphemy
lies
it
can
not
be
true
and
the
speaker
started
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
terrace
of
the
roof
garden
the
sanhedrim
seems
satisfied
that
nothing
will
come
of
it
he
went
on
angrily
let
be
say
they
the
thing
will
die
even
as
the
pah
they
are
blind
look
you
here
are
the
facts
the
man
s
body
disappears
on
the
third
day
after
the
crucifixion
the
roman
guards
tell
a
drunken
tale
of
earthquake
and
the
appearance
of
an
angel
with
a
sword
lies
all
lies
that
i
have
managed
gold
worketh
wonders
they
know
now
that
they
were
drunken
and
that
his
disciples
stole
the
body
away
while
they
slept
so
far
well
then
there
is
the
matter
of
the
rent
veil
before
the
holy
of
holies
a
sore
mischance
the
fabric
had
been
eaten
of
insects
there
is
no
question
of
it
how
else
should
it
who
saw
the
thing
done
interrupted
caiaphas
in
a
hollow
tone
a
half
score
of
priests
who
were
preparing
the
altar
for
the
evening
sacrifice
it
was
rent
with
a
loud
noise
say
they
and
the
holiest
place
revealed
on
a
sudden
i
have
counseled
that
they
hold
their
peace
it
may
be
that
they
also
are
apostate
but
i
dare
not
take
the
steps
that
i
would
in
the
matter
because
of
the
people
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
the
man
is
dead
in
that
have
we
triumphed
i
saw
him
die
and
he
is
as
assuredly
perished
as
are
the
wretched
malefactors
that
groaned
that
day
on
either
side
of
his
cross
the
face
of
caiaphas
blanched
to
the
livid
color
of
death
say
no
more
he
gasped
huskily
i
am
not
well
annas
stared
at
him
for
an
instant
with
something
like
contempt
i
will
call
a
servant
he
said
at
length
thou
shouldst
drink
wine
to
strengthen
thy
heart
the
man
is
strangely
wrought
upon
by
this
thing
he
thought
within
himself
as
he
strode
away
he
is
like
to
a
rope
of
sand
i
must
not
look
to
him
for
help
who
is
there
then
of
stout
heart
and
good
courage
issachar
johanan
alexander
they
all
be
like
wax
which
the
sun
hath
melted
stay
there
is
the
young
saul
of
tarsus
a
pharisee
of
the
pharisees
and
zealous
for
the
upbuilding
of
israel
i
will
even
dispatch
a
swift
messenger
for
him
he
will
be
an
instrument
of
wrath
in
mine
hand
against
the
enemies
of
the
lord
jehovah
as
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
died
away
the
sick
man
raised
his
head
begone
he
said
with
an
irritable
gesture
to
the
servant
who
stood
awaiting
his
pleasure
call
my
wife
even
as
he
spoke
the
heavy
curtains
which
hung
over
the
doorway
near
at
hand
parted
and
the
figure
of
a
woman
emerged
onto
the
terrace
where
hast
thou
been
said
the
invalid
fixing
his
sunken
eyes
angrily
upon
her
dost
thou
not
know
that
i
can
not
abide
that
clumsy
hind
barak
where
is
my
cordial
here
my
lord
said
anna
soothingly
pouring
a
few
drops
of
some
liquid
into
a
cup
her
slender
hand
trembled
so
violently
as
she
did
this
that
a
portion
of
the
contents
was
spilled
and
lay
a
crimson
pool
between
them
on
the
white
marble
of
the
pavement
the
sick
man
shrank
back
among
his
pillows
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
ay
there
it
is
again
he
muttered
huskily
blood
blood
the
blood
of
the
nazarene
i
shall
always
see
it
look
he
shrieked
it
is
crawling
towards
me
the
woman
sprang
forward
her
face
colorless
it
is
nothing
she
said
breathlessly
nothing
my
lord
see
it
is
gone
come
drink
the
cordial
after
that
thou
shalt
rest
thou
art
weary
caiaphas
looked
into
the
cup
it
is
blood
he
said
shudderingly
yet
must
i
drink
it
god
is
just
then
he
lay
back
among
his
pillows
once
more
his
eyes
closed
after
a
time
a
faint
color
crept
into
his
livid
face
the
woman
watched
him
patiently
for
a
full
hour
more
than
once
her
pale
lips
moving
as
if
in
prayer
from
her
dark
eyes
there
seemed
to
stream
forth
a
visible
radiance
of
love
which
brooded
in
silent
blessing
over
the
helpless
form
at
her
side
at
length
the
sick
man
stirred
a
little
his
eyes
unclosed
has
it
been
told
thee
what
hath
befallen
our
son
he
said
slowly
and
clearly
the
woman
bowed
her
head
it
hath
been
told
me
she
whispered
brokenly
that
his
life
was
ended
even
as
he
was
crucified
said
caiaphas
still
in
the
same
slow
clear
tone
even
as
was
the
nazarene
god
is
just
blood
for
blood
it
is
the
law
and
hath
been
from
the
beginning
god
is
also
love
said
anna
looking
fearfully
into
her
husband
s
face
he
returned
the
look
with
one
of
full
intelligence
do
not
fear
he
said
gently
it
is
best
that
the
matter
hath
been
spoken
between
us
it
were
like
an
open
grave
else
the
madness
hath
passed
from
my
brain
now
and
i
see
he
paused
and
so
terrible
a
look
came
over
his
face
that
his
wife
cried
out
faintly
god
is
love
she
repeated
in
a
low
voice
wringing
her
hands
he
will
forgive
how
couldst
thou
know
that
the
nazarene
was
the
anointed
one
yet
even
he
said
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
as
they
drove
the
nails
into
his
hands
woman
said
caiaphas
with
something
of
his
old
authority
hold
thy
peace
and
forget
that
thou
hast
spoken
blasphemy
didst
think
then
that
i
i
the
high
priest
was
ready
to
confess
that
the
nazarene
was
the
messiah
of
israel
i
am
ready
to
confess
that
he
was
an
innocent
man
and
i
am
in
that
i
brought
about
his
death
god
hath
punished
me
by
slaying
my
son
even
as
he
punished
david
for
his
sin
after
this
once
we
will
speak
of
the
thing
no
more
it
shall
never
again
be
named
between
us
nor
shall
it
be
made
known
to
any
other
it
were
not
meet
that
so
shameful
a
thing
be
bruited
about
concerning
the
high
priest
our
flesh
and
blood
is
accursed
the
mother
s
face
flushed
hotly
the
lad
was
innocent
she
cried
he
was
sinned
against
most
foully
but
he
himself
sinned
not
he
is
in
paradise
for
he
hath
the
word
of
the
lord
what
meanest
thou
who
told
thee
concerning
the
thing
said
caiaphas
raising
himself
up
and
fixing
his
burning
eyes
upon
her
face
i
had
it
from
a
lad
named
stephen
who
was
even
as
a
brother
to
him
who
was
our
son
titus
he
was
called
as
he
hung
upon
the
cross
in
agony
the
lord
spake
to
him
and
said
this
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
who
is
this
stephen
said
caiaphas
in
a
low
terrible
voice
and
whom
dost
thou
call
lord
anna
trembled
with
terror
she
tried
to
speak
but
the
words
died
upon
her
lips
speak
woman
stephen
is
the
son
of
the
greek
who
took
our
child
the
man
hath
been
punished
for
his
sin
he
also
perished
with
the
lord
there
was
an
awful
silence
then
caiaphas
again
spoke
and
his
voice
was
as
the
voice
of
a
stranger
in
the
ears
of
anna
this
stephen
the
son
of
the
malefactor
doth
he
still
live
he
lives
but
oh
my
husband
i
beseech
thee
do
not
harm
him
so
innocent
so
heavenly
a
one
but
through
the
words
of
her
entreaty
sounded
the
inexorable
tones
of
the
high
priest
s
voice
blood
for
blood
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
upon
the
children
even
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generations
it
is
the
law
chapter
iv
in
place
of
judas
what
and
if
while
we
wait
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
the
same
men
who
have
slain
our
lord
shall
also
turn
their
hand
against
us
we
be
few
in
number
and
there
is
naught
to
shield
us
from
their
fury
thou
didst
see
when
we
praised
god
in
the
temple
even
this
day
how
the
chief
priests
and
the
elders
cast
upon
us
looks
which
were
as
sharp
arrows
in
the
hands
of
mighty
men
of
valor
shall
the
wolves
which
slew
the
shepherd
spare
the
flock
hadst
thou
faith
even
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
thou
wouldst
not
doubt
the
word
of
the
lord
ye
shall
be
baptized
with
the
holy
spirit
not
many
days
hence
depart
not
from
jerusalem
till
that
the
promise
is
fulfilled
to
you
and
how
sayest
thou
that
there
is
naught
to
shield
us
god
the
almighty
one
even
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
whom
we
saw
received
up
into
heaven
he
shall
protect
us
from
the
wrath
of
the
jews
he
hath
suffered
me
to
be
tempted
with
doubts
and
fears
more
than
most
said
thomas
glancing
fearfully
at
a
group
of
men
in
the
garb
of
rabbis
who
were
approaching
them
along
the
narrow
street
but
do
not
thou
despise
me
because
of
mine
infirmities
the
lord
said
to
thee
thou
art
peter
the
rock
unto
me
he
said
be
not
faithless
but
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
believe
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
rejoice
when
the
lord
hath
left
us
alone
and
ah
sawest
thou
that
look
the
old
man
was
annas
the
other
was
issachar
the
cruel
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
with
them
there
burned
a
very
fury
of
hate
he
lusteth
for
our
blood
i
have
not
before
seen
his
face
said
peter
thoughtfully
then
he
turned
himself
about
to
look
after
the
retreating
figures
as
he
did
so
the
young
man
of
whom
thomas
had
spoken
also
turned
and
again
peter
felt
the
indignant
fire
of
his
gaze
it
matters
not
he
said
after
a
pause
what
the
heart
of
man
shall
devise
the
will
of
the
almighty
shall
be
done
on
earth
as
also
in
heaven
and
he
looked
upward
longingly
as
if
he
hoped
to
pierce
through
the
deeps
of
blue
to
that
place
whither
his
lord
had
gone
and
having
come
now
to
the
place
where
they
were
wont
to
gather
together
they
went
in
it
was
the
same
house
where
they
had
made
ready
the
passover
at
the
word
of
the
lord
on
that
awful
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
and
in
the
large
upper
room
made
sacred
by
the
memories
of
that
last
supper
with
their
lord
they
found
them
which
believed
it
was
to
this
place
they
had
come
after
they
had
seen
the
cloud
receive
him
out
of
their
sight
the
words
of
the
angels
yet
ringing
in
their
ears
this
jesus
which
was
received
up
from
you
into
heaven
shall
so
come
in
like
manner
as
ye
beheld
him
going
into
heaven
and
here
day
by
day
they
gathered
to
wait
for
the
mysterious
comforter
which
was
to
come
to
them
out
of
heaven
they
knew
not
how
in
the
hearts
of
some
of
them
burned
the
hope
that
the
comforter
might
be
the
lord
himself
and
that
at
last
they
should
see
the
promised
kingdom
of
the
messiah
there
be
but
eleven
of
us
whom
he
chose
for
this
ministry
said
peter
looking
around
on
the
little
assembly
which
numbered
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
persons
it
was
needful
that
the
scriptures
should
be
fulfilled
concerning
judas
who
betrayed
our
lord
into
the
hands
of
them
that
slew
him
but
now
he
is
dead
and
hath
gone
to
his
own
place
and
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
psalms
let
his
habitation
be
made
desolate
let
no
man
dwell
therein
his
office
let
another
of
the
men
therefore
which
have
companied
with
us
while
the
lord
jesus
remained
upon
earth
from
the
day
when
he
received
baptism
in
the
jordan
unto
that
day
in
which
he
was
taken
up
into
heaven
of
these
must
one
become
a
witness
of
his
resurrection
how
then
shall
the
will
of
god
be
known
in
the
matter
said
john
gravely
we
have
not
the
spirit
of
discernment
for
did
we
not
trust
even
judas
who
betrayed
him
albeit
the
lord
knew
him
from
the
beginning
let
god
himself
choose
cried
peter
it
hath
been
the
custom
in
israel
since
the
days
of
old
to
decide
such
matters
by
lot
so
did
god
select
his
chosen
priests
from
the
family
of
eleazar
so
also
doth
he
chose
which
one
shall
stand
by
the
altar
of
incense
in
the
temple
then
wrote
they
upon
tablets
of
wood
every
one
the
name
of
the
man
he
thought
most
holy
and
acceptable
and
worthy
to
witness
with
the
eleven
to
the
resurrection
of
jesus
and
the
tablets
were
cast
into
a
basin
and
it
was
found
that
joseph
barsabas
called
justus
and
matthias
were
named
then
peter
called
these
two
men
to
stand
up
before
the
company
of
the
disciples
and
he
prayed
aloud
unto
the
lord
in
these
words
thou
lord
which
knowest
the
hearts
of
all
men
show
of
these
two
the
one
whom
thou
hast
chosen
to
take
the
place
in
this
ministry
and
apostleship
from
which
judas
fell
away
that
he
might
go
to
his
own
place
then
cast
they
the
tablets
whereon
were
written
the
names
of
justus
and
matthias
into
the
brazen
cup
and
peter
shook
the
cup
and
the
name
of
matthias
leapt
out
and
from
henceforward
he
was
numbered
with
the
apostles
as
they
went
away
from
the
upper
room
to
their
abiding
places
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
and
salome
and
mary
of
magdala
together
with
john
the
beloved
disciple
they
talked
with
one
another
of
what
had
been
done
stephen
also
was
with
them
we
are
again
twelve
said
john
with
a
sigh
for
he
bethought
him
of
the
days
when
there
was
yet
another
the
lord
was
upon
earth
for
forty
days
after
that
he
arose
from
the
dead
said
stephen
thoughtfully
his
eyes
fixed
upon
a
bright
star
which
shone
above
the
horizon
like
a
golden
lamp
why
then
did
not
he
himself
choose
one
to
fill
the
place
of
judas
john
looked
startled
what
dost
thou
mean
he
said
quickly
turning
to
look
at
the
young
man
in
the
half
darkness
could
he
not
have
chosen
had
he
wished
it
could
he
not
yet
choose
being
set
down
at
the
right
hand
of
god
and
dost
thou
think
to
question
the
doings
of
god
s
elect
said
john
a
ring
of
authority
in
his
mild
tones
nay
my
son
chide
not
the
lad
said
mary
i
myself
doubted
whether
indeed
the
casting
of
lots
be
pleasing
to
god
god
hath
permitted
men
many
things
in
the
past
because
of
their
blindness
it
is
a
practice
of
wicked
men
cried
stephen
i
have
seen
thieves
do
the
like
to
apportion
their
booty
and
did
not
the
roman
soldiers
also
at
the
foot
of
his
cross
cast
lots
for
the
garments
of
the
crucified
one
god
knoweth
that
we
meant
it
aright
said
john
humbly
his
face
full
of
trouble
we
have
not
yet
the
spirit
of
discernment
and
are
as
those
who
stumble
in
the
darkness
when
the
spirit
of
truth
is
come
he
will
teach
you
all
things
said
stephen
softly
and
bring
all
things
to
your
remembrance
whatsoever
i
have
taught
ay
those
were
his
words
we
have
need
of
it
sore
need
did
we
not
forget
on
that
day
of
dread
that
he
had
even
told
us
told
us
plainly
and
many
times
that
so
it
must
be
yet
had
we
failed
to
understand
nay
we
would
not
understand
the
slight
form
of
mary
trembled
and
her
voice
shook
as
she
said
many
years
hath
fear
been
a
guest
in
my
heart
since
the
day
simeon
said
to
me
when
i
presented
my
son
a
babe
before
the
lord
behold
this
child
is
set
for
the
falling
and
rising
up
of
many
in
israel
and
for
a
sign
which
is
spoken
against
yea
and
a
sword
shall
pierce
through
thine
own
soul
that
thoughts
out
of
many
hearts
may
be
the
sword
hath
drunken
deep
of
my
heart
s
blood
yet
will
i
trust
him
though
he
slay
me
the
worst
hath
happened
for
us
all
said
stephen
clasping
her
hand
he
is
alive
he
is
ascended
and
yet
is
he
with
us
for
he
said
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
it
can
not
be
then
that
we
have
gone
very
far
wrong
said
john
slowly
it
shall
yet
be
according
to
his
will
if
matthias
be
not
the
elect
of
god
for
the
apostleship
yet
shall
he
walk
with
us
and
the
pierced
hand
of
the
master
himself
shall
touch
another
which
as
yet
we
know
not
there
were
thirteen
in
our
fellowship
while
he
was
upon
earth
and
having
come
to
the
place
of
their
abode
they
went
in
chapter
in
the
abode
of
kings
hast
thou
a
torch
nay
but
it
is
impossible
that
they
be
here
pah
i
can
not
abide
the
odor
of
mummies
yet
must
thou
pass
centuries
in
their
company
if
indeed
thou
art
fortunate
enough
to
die
in
a
civilized
land
and
the
speaker
s
lips
widened
till
they
revealed
a
row
of
yellow
teeth
amu
bent
over
and
gazed
steadily
for
a
moment
into
the
black
opening
that
yawned
at
his
feet
then
he
looked
up
at
his
companion
something
in
his
sombre
eyes
caused
the
yellow
row
of
teeth
to
disappear
i
am
going
home
he
said
suddenly
tis
good
go
back
fetch
me
a
torch
and
i
will
explore
for
the
singing
bird
i
am
not
minded
to
move
from
this
place
till
i
shall
seize
her
hast
thou
water
nay
but
thou
hast
a
bottle
at
thy
girdle
give
it
me
even
at
this
moment
i
thirst
by
sechet
it
is
empty
but
stay
there
is
a
fountain
beyond
the
crest
of
yonder
hill
go
quench
thy
thirst
i
will
remain
till
thou
shalt
return
besa
hesitated
he
looked
steadily
into
the
lowering
face
of
amu
thou
art
in
a
strange
humor
friend
he
said
at
length
i
have
been
patient
with
thee
but
i
will
bear
no
more
give
me
thy
flask
i
will
fill
it
at
the
fountain
the
face
of
amu
blanched
to
a
sickly
yellow
hue
his
eyes
glowed
with
fury
but
he
said
not
a
word
with
a
sudden
quick
movement
he
seized
the
bridle
of
his
mule
and
leaping
upon
its
back
galloped
away
towards
memphis
besa
looked
after
him
quietly
what
may
be
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
said
to
himself
stay
let
me
consider
for
a
moment
the
man
comes
to
me
and
says
in
effect
this
thou
art
a
dealer
in
slaves
i
can
procure
for
thee
two
of
good
value
a
lad
and
a
maiden
the
maiden
hath
a
voice
like
to
the
sound
of
nightingales
yet
can
not
i
bring
them
to
the
proper
at
the
same
time
i
besa
am
commissioned
to
procure
a
singing
slave
for
the
princess
who
pineth
in
a
sickly
melancholy
but
what
have
i
suffered
in
the
matter
thus
far
i
have
been
half
killed
by
a
fall
now
am
i
parched
with
thirst
and
the
man
lies
to
me
concerning
his
i
saw
him
fill
it
before
we
started
therefore
i
ventured
to
leave
mine
own
which
i
could
not
at
the
moment
lay
my
hands
upon
there
is
no
fountain
behind
the
brow
of
yonder
hill
for
what
purpose
hath
the
man
lied
there
is
something
here
that
i
can
not
see
i
will
for
the
present
forego
the
matter
but
there
are
two
things
to
be
set
down
for
the
future
and
besa
is
not
the
man
to
forget
then
he
advanced
to
the
opening
of
the
tomb
which
showed
black
in
its
setting
of
yellow
sand
kneeling
clown
he
looked
carefully
at
the
stone
stairway
which
led
down
into
the
depths
the
sand
was
sifting
in
with
each
breath
of
the
hot
desert
wind
it
has
been
opened
but
a
short
time
he
remarked
at
length
it
will
be
a
pious
act
for
me
to
replace
the
stone
anubis
will
reward
me
for
it
one
must
not
fail
in
duty
to
the
sacred
dead
then
he
raised
his
voice
rest
quietly
my
children
there
is
nought
to
hurt
thee
in
the
abodes
of
the
departed
song
and
sunlight
laughter
and
air
are
needed
no
more
by
the
slaves
of
anubis
his
slave
shalt
thou
be
unless
thou
presently
come
forth
in
answer
to
my
cry
the
sound
of
his
voice
echoed
in
dismal
reverberations
through
the
hollow
blackness
within
but
there
was
no
sign
that
his
words
fell
upon
other
ears
than
those
sealed
to
eternal
silence
within
their
swathings
of
spiced
linen
the
heavy
odor
of
death
ascended
in
stupefying
clouds
into
the
face
of
the
man
as
he
knelt
at
the
edge
of
the
tomb
he
drew
back
a
little
and
the
malignant
smile
faded
from
his
face
the
stone
shall
be
put
back
he
said
doggedly
for
i
believe
by
my
life
that
they
be
down
there
they
will
live
till
i
shall
return
with
torches
and
men
if
i
secure
them
both
i
shall
be
avenged
also
upon
amu
forthwith
he
bent
over
and
laid
hold
upon
the
stone
it
was
heavy
and
though
the
lad
in
his
mad
fear
had
succeeded
in
shoving
it
to
one
side
the
man
could
with
difficulty
stir
it
a
single
inch
the
sun
beat
down
in
fury
upon
his
head
the
hot
wind
sang
in
his
ears
with
a
strange
sound
of
buzzing
insects
and
humming
wheels
he
stepped
down
into
the
stairway
the
better
to
grasp
the
stone
for
another
mighty
effort
suddenly
a
wave
as
of
fire
swept
before
his
eyes
his
hands
relaxed
their
hold
he
reeled
a
little
and
then
fell
a
nerveless
heap
into
the
darkness
to
seth
and
anat
who
were
crouching
behind
a
huge
sarcophagus
the
sound
at
first
signified
nothing
but
some
fresh
horror
i
must
cry
out
urged
seth
in
a
vehement
whisper
we
shall
perish
in
this
place
for
i
can
not
move
the
stone
from
beneath
but
anat
held
him
fast
better
slavery
to
death
than
to
such
a
man
seth
watched
the
shaft
of
yellow
light
that
pierced
the
thick
darkness
presently
he
thought
shudderingly
it
will
disappear
but
the
moments
crept
slowly
by
and
the
sun
still
poured
in
revealing
the
countless
dancing
atoms
which
had
leapt
up
from
the
sleep
of
centuries
beneath
the
feet
of
the
fugitives
anat
he
whispered
something
has
happened
i
will
go
and
see
the
blind
girl
held
him
fast
for
a
moment
longer
she
bent
her
head
there
was
no
sound
save
the
sighing
of
the
wind
outside
and
the
hissing
murmur
of
the
sand
as
it
drifted
onto
the
stairway
of
their
prison
go
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
has
departed
seth
rose
cautiously
to
his
feet
and
crept
toward
the
opening
his
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
darkness
now
and
he
could
see
on
either
side
the
vast
wooden
cases
in
which
dwelt
the
dead
their
great
eyes
stared
at
him
as
he
hurried
past
he
stumbled
presently
over
something
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
stone
steps
starting
back
with
a
cry
he
perceived
that
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
he
had
fallen
upon
his
face
in
the
sand
and
lay
quite
motionless
the
lad
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
in
fascinated
silence
then
he
bethought
him
that
presently
the
man
might
recover
his
senses
turning
he
darted
back
into
the
darkness
come
he
said
breathlessly
in
the
ear
of
the
blind
girl
treading
lightly
that
they
might
not
awake
the
sleeper
the
two
crept
up
the
stair
not
without
many
a
fearful
backward
glance
at
the
quiet
figure
which
still
lay
on
its
face
the
monstrous
staring
eyes
of
the
mummies
looking
on
unmoved
and
the
stealthy
wind
already
beginning
to
urge
the
uneasy
desert
to
come
cover
this
man
that
hath
lain
him
down
to
sleep
unasked
in
the
abode
of
kings
shall
i
put
the
stone
in
its
place
said
seth
when
they
had
reached
the
upper
air
yes
said
the
girl
clenching
her
thin
hands
let
him
bide
there
till
the
other
shall
seek
him
and
if
that
be
never
then
i
care
not
would
he
not
have
left
us
to
perish
but
the
gods
stayed
his
hand
the
lad
hesitated
he
hath
no
water
fetch
him
water
then
and
food
also
if
thou
wilt
thou
art
for
myself
i
should
leave
him
as
he
is
dost
thou
not
see
that
it
is
now
that
we
must
make
good
our
escape
once
the
man
hath
recovered
himself
we
are
lost
i
can
hear
the
bells
of
his
beast
let
us
seize
it
and
flee
away
into
the
desert
that
we
may
find
the
magician
who
can
open
the
eyes
of
them
that
see
not
we
could
not
pass
the
wilderness
we
should
perish
by
the
way
anat
sat
down
in
the
sand
thou
art
a
man
she
said
scornfully
and
therefore
wise
i
am
as
the
dust
under
thy
feet
i
have
no
eyes
to
see
with
yet
shall
i
tell
thee
what
shall
come
to
pass
go
down
now
to
our
enemy
whom
the
gods
have
smitten
raise
him
up
and
pour
water
into
his
mouth
and
upon
his
head
then
when
he
shall
come
to
himself
say
to
him
here
now
is
thy
beast
i
will
set
thee
upon
it
that
thou
mayest
ride
as
for
this
maid
whom
thou
didst
covet
behold
she
is
thine
i
also
will
run
before
and
the
girl
laughed
aloud
and
tossed
her
head
so
that
all
the
gold
and
silver
coins
of
her
necklace
clinked
musically
together
seth
looked
at
her
indignantly
all
women
have
the
poison
of
asps
under
their
tongues
he
muttered
it
hath
been
told
me
and
it
is
even
true
i
have
seen
men
beat
their
women
for
less
it
purgeth
them
from
folly
the
blind
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
wilt
thou
beat
me
because
i
have
proved
that
thou
art
the
fool
she
cried
her
voice
choking
with
rage
yes
let
it
be
so
i
care
not
but
i
had
thought
that
thou
wast
not
as
others
that
thou
didst
love
me
blind
useless
helpless
though
i
be
and
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
the
lad
was
at
her
side
in
a
moment
i
do
love
thee
he
murmured
penitently
i
have
no
other
on
earth
thou
art
my
all
come
it
shall
be
as
thou
hast
said
here
is
the
beast
with
such
a
pretty
saddle
little
one
all
of
crimson
velvet
and
hung
with
bells
of
silver
it
is
thine
the
gods
have
given
it
thee
we
will
go
away
towards
the
first
halting
place
i
am
sure
that
i
can
find
it
anat
checked
her
sobs
after
a
due
space
she
even
allowed
herself
to
be
placed
upon
the
back
of
the
mule
have
i
the
poison
of
asps
under
my
tongue
she
said
plaintively
but
with
a
gleam
of
triumph
not
so
by
osiris
i
was
a
brute
to
say
such
a
thing
rather
hast
thou
a
voice
as
sweet
as
the
voice
of
fountains
and
as
the
voice
of
thrushes
that
sing
by
the
river
but
i
shall
place
water
where
our
enemy
can
drink
when
he
awakens
and
i
will
not
close
the
stone
altogether
i
will
leave
a
little
space
where
the
sun
may
enter
into
that
noisome
place
this
shall
be
shall
it
not
little
sister
anat
tossed
her
head
she
made
no
reply
then
seth
made
haste
and
poured
water
into
a
cup
and
set
it
on
the
step
where
their
enemy
should
see
it
when
he
awoke
he
took
also
from
his
wallet
a
handful
of
parched
corn
and
laid
it
beside
the
cup
looking
sidewise
at
the
man
who
still
lay
all
along
on
his
face
just
as
he
had
been
stricken
he
fancied
that
he
saw
him
stir
a
little
and
the
terror
came
back
upon
him
so
that
he
sprang
up
the
steps
two
at
a
time
and
with
a
mighty
effort
drew
the
great
stone
forward
over
the
opening
forgetting
in
his
fear
to
leave
it
open
ever
so
little
that
the
sun
might
look
in
after
that
the
two
fled
away
their
faces
set
towards
the
great
and
terrible
wilderness
beyond
which
lay
the
land
of
their
hope
chapter
vi
the
lord
of
the
abu
ben
hesed
was
a
mighty
man
of
war
he
was
also
rich
ten
score
of
camels
swift
dromedaries
not
a
few
and
horses
such
that
men
paid
great
sums
of
gold
to
possess
them
flocks
of
sheep
and
of
goats
wives
also
and
children
in
plenty
all
of
these
things
together
with
the
unquestioning
obedience
and
devotion
of
his
tribe
did
this
dweller
in
the
desert
call
his
own
he
was
a
tall
man
and
his
beard
descended
upon
his
breast
in
waves
of
silvery
whiteness
yet
were
his
eyes
as
keen
as
the
eyes
of
a
mountain
eagle
and
there
was
no
one
of
all
his
tribe
who
could
endure
hunger
and
thirst
as
could
ben
hesed
not
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
so
endure
for
was
not
he
lord
of
all
the
land
that
lay
betwixt
the
mountains
on
the
south
of
the
great
wilderness
of
shur
even
unto
the
sea
to
satisfy
the
appetite
is
not
always
good
he
was
wont
to
say
to
his
sons
this
will
the
beasts
do
whenever
they
find
provender
man
alone
can
say
to
himself
thou
shalt
fast
because
i
have
willed
it
hunger
thus
endured
maketh
man
king
over
the
beasts
thus
is
he
set
apart
from
them
and
so
do
his
thoughts
soar
above
the
earth
even
unto
the
region
of
the
heavens
where
dwelleth
ja
the
maker
of
the
stars
and
also
of
man
on
this
day
ben
hesed
sat
alone
in
the
door
of
his
tent
the
sun
was
sinking
a
ball
of
scarlet
behind
the
purple
rim
of
the
horizon
a
group
of
camels
browsing
on
the
scanty
desert
growths
showed
black
against
its
fiery
glow
their
shadows
stretching
long
and
gaunt
across
the
sand
about
the
margin
of
a
meagre
pool
close
at
hand
a
cluster
of
palm
trees
also
meagre
reared
their
heads
clasping
their
dusty
fronds
across
the
water
as
if
to
hide
this
sacred
treasure
of
the
desert
from
the
fierce
wooing
of
the
sun
the
voices
of
the
women
coming
and
going
with
their
and
the
laughter
and
cooing
of
half
a
score
of
naked
brown
babies
who
lay
contentedly
kicking
up
their
heels
in
the
warm
sand
came
pleasantly
to
the
ear
of
abu
ben
hesed
he
cared
not
that
the
pool
was
meagre
and
the
palm
trees
stunted
this
only
made
them
the
more
precious
and
wonderful
more
truly
the
works
of
jehovah
who
had
set
them
thus
in
the
midst
of
this
great
and
terrible
wilderness
like
jewels
of
price
he
had
looked
upon
fruitful
lands
and
great
rivers
upon
cities
also
where
men
dwelt
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
and
his
soul
had
grown
sick
within
him
at
the
sight
it
was
not
because
of
their
disobedience
only
he
said
that
jehovah
led
the
children
of
israel
for
forty
years
in
the
desert
but
also
because
far
from
the
lustful
fat
earth
and
teeming
rivers
and
the
abominations
of
stone
and
wood
that
men
call
cities
he
might
reveal
to
them
himself
in
fountains
in
the
beauty
of
night
and
morning
and
in
the
flowers
which
flourished
in
the
arid
soil
of
the
desert
he
beheld
the
love
of
god
in
the
deep
valleys
and
solemn
mountain
crests
where
the
seething
primal
rock
in
some
remote
and
terrible
time
had
gathered
itself
into
mighty
waves
and
fantastic
pinnacles
only
to
stand
still
forever
at
the
word
of
the
lord
he
perceived
his
power
and
in
the
blinding
scorching
whirlwind
of
sand
before
whose
withering
breath
nothing
mortal
could
stand
and
in
whose
fiery
garments
the
sun
itself
seemed
smothered
he
saw
the
wrath
of
jehovah
as
abu
ben
hesed
mused
thus
within
himself
he
became
aware
after
a
time
that
a
man
was
coming
swiftly
towards
him
out
of
the
desert
his
garments
girt
about
him
he
slackened
not
his
pace
till
he
came
to
the
spot
where
ben
hesed
sat
in
the
door
of
his
tent
then
he
cast
himself
down
before
him
and
rent
his
garments
with
a
loud
cry
of
grief
woe
is
me
my
lord
he
cried
when
he
could
find
his
breath
i
am
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
speak
my
son
said
ben
hesed
who
had
recognized
in
the
man
one
of
his
herdsmen
what
hath
befallen
thine
enemy
who
dwells
in
the
hath
fallen
upon
the
flocks
this
day
and
hath
carried
away
of
the
herds
a
goodly
number
of
also
and
their
foals
three
and
of
the
horses
the
stallion
dekar
and
thou
livest
to
tell
me
this
said
ben
hesed
his
eyes
burning
with
anger
why
didst
thou
not
defend
the
flocks
woe
is
me
repeated
the
man
casting
the
dust
upon
his
head
i
have
not
yet
told
the
worst
we
fought
valiantly
and
thy
son
eri
is
slain
together
with
kish
the
herdsman
when
this
befell
we
fled
before
the
face
of
the
enemy
the
flocks
also
and
the
herds
are
scattered
as
the
sand
of
the
desert
before
the
wind
and
there
is
nought
to
hinder
them
from
falling
into
the
hand
of
the
oppressor
then
abu
ben
hesed
arose
and
rent
his
clothes
and
cast
dust
upon
his
head
jehovah
hath
caused
me
to
be
smitten
he
said
nevertheless
all
his
ways
are
right
ways
i
should
have
watched
for
mine
enemy
for
he
hath
grown
lusty
and
flourishing
of
late
i
will
get
me
after
him
and
smite
him
till
he
shall
cry
aloud
for
succor
jehovah
grant
me
my
desire
upon
mine
enemy
alas
for
my
son
eri
he
hath
been
murderously
cut
down
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
from
the
bright
morning
of
his
days
he
hath
been
plunged
suddenly
into
the
night
of
death
but
behold
his
blood
crieth
to
me
for
vengeance
out
of
the
desert
let
us
make
haste
the
terrible
news
spread
throughout
the
encampment
withering
the
peaceful
evening
joy
like
the
hot
breath
of
a
sirocco
the
women
ceased
their
gay
incessant
chatter
and
broke
into
loud
wailing
and
the
frightened
children
wept
with
fear
at
the
sound
alas
alas
cried
the
mother
of
the
dead
man
alas
for
my
son
he
was
straight
and
comely
as
a
palm
tree
beautiful
also
and
pleasant
in
his
speech
woe
woe
he
will
no
more
open
his
mouth
with
kindness
nor
will
his
lips
break
forth
with
singing
woe
woe
shrilled
the
other
women
rocking
to
and
fro
and
casting
the
ashes
from
the
dying
fire
upon
their
dishevelled
heads
morning
and
evening
hath
he
led
forth
the
flocks
moaned
the
mother
he
will
lead
them
forth
no
more
wailed
her
companions
alas
for
the
betrothed
maiden
she
is
desolate
even
as
a
widow
without
little
ones
hath
she
become
woe
woe
through
all
the
clamor
of
the
wailing
sounded
the
clashing
of
weapons
and
the
neighing
of
horses
as
the
men
with
set
teeth
and
lowering
brows
made
ready
for
the
pursuit
of
their
enemy
within
the
hour
they
departed
a
hundred
strong
the
swift
hoofs
of
their
horses
casting
up
the
dust
of
the
desert
behind
them
as
they
vanished
a
big
with
storm
into
the
night
before
dawn
abu
ben
hesed
had
seen
his
desire
upon
his
enemy
they
had
discovered
the
marauders
as
they
were
making
merry
with
their
spoil
and
had
fallen
upon
them
suddenly
so
that
they
had
no
time
to
escape
the
eyes
of
ben
hesed
were
terrible
to
look
upon
as
he
cut
down
the
flying
wretches
let
no
one
of
them
escape
he
cried
aloud
slay
and
spare
not
afterward
they
gathered
the
spoil
of
the
dead
together
with
their
own
stolen
possessions
and
turned
their
faces
once
more
toward
the
north
the
heart
of
ben
hesed
was
as
lead
within
his
bosom
after
all
he
thought
what
doth
it
profit
to
revenge
oneself
on
an
enemy
my
son
is
not
restored
nor
is
my
herdsman
yet
it
is
the
law
blood
for
blood
and
the
law
is
good
he
raised
his
eyes
wearily
and
looked
away
toward
the
east
where
the
dawn
was
beginning
with
solemn
pomp
and
splendor
long
rays
of
tremulous
light
flickered
athwart
the
cold
clear
blue
of
the
heavens
the
morning
star
burned
pallid
amidst
the
growing
radiance
till
at
last
it
was
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
oncoming
flood
of
day
abu
ben
hesed
looked
down
at
his
clothing
and
at
his
hands
which
were
red
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
he
loathed
himself
at
that
moment
i
see
something
yonder
which
resembles
a
man
said
his
eldest
son
who
rode
beside
him
also
a
beast
lying
down
what
can
it
be
think
you
my
lord
another
of
our
enemies
who
hath
perchance
escaped
us
in
the
darkness
abu
ben
hesed
turned
his
eyes
in
the
direction
to
which
the
man
pointed
it
is
death
he
said
quietly
the
vultures
are
already
gathering
to
the
feast
nay
i
have
seen
the
figure
move
shall
i
go
and
see
what
the
thing
may
be
go
my
son
if
the
man
be
alive
slay
him
not
but
bring
him
to
me
unhurt
the
son
of
abu
obeyed
drawing
near
the
object
and
circling
about
it
cautiously
that
he
might
view
it
from
every
side
presently
he
dismounted
and
walked
quite
up
to
the
thing
his
horse
following
at
his
heels
and
snuffing
at
the
air
suspiciously
two
or
three
great
birds
with
bare
flabby
necks
and
red
eyes
rose
slowly
from
the
ground
at
his
approach
and
flapped
heavily
away
croaking
dismally
they
had
been
busy
on
the
carcass
of
a
mule
which
lay
dead
upon
the
sand
its
gay
saddle
of
crimson
velvet
hung
with
silver
bells
befouled
and
draggled
at
a
little
distance
and
quite
motionless
was
a
heap
of
drapery
from
which
protruded
a
slender
brown
foot
a
child
said
ben
abu
two
of
them
he
added
as
he
pulled
aside
the
striped
covering
of
cotton
cloth
which
concealed
their
faces
dead
from
thirst
was
his
verdict
after
he
had
turned
them
over
and
had
noted
with
a
certain
dimness
of
his
keen
vision
their
swollen
tongues
and
the
which
lay
beside
the
lad
quite
empty
then
he
stood
up
and
blew
a
long
blast
on
the
ram
s
horn
which

carried
at
his
girdle
chapter
vii
the
pharisee
from
tarsus
oh
that
jehovah
would
rend
the
heavens
that
israel
might
see
his
righteousness
my
heart
burneth
within
me
as
a
live
coal
i
can
not
sleep
because
of
these
things
god
hath
given
thee
this
spirit
my
son
because
of
the
peril
of
his
chosen
he
shall
greatly
prosper
the
work
of
thine
hand
annas
uttered
these
words
in
a
low
smooth
voice
drawing
his
long
silvery
beard
through
his
delicate
fingers
and
looking
keenly
from
under
his
eyelids
at
the
dark
eager
face
before
him
if
i
could
only
help
on
the
day
of
his
coming
said
the
young
man
rising
and
pacing
restlessly
up
and
down
the
floor
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
his
head
sunken
upon
his
breast
as
he
walked
thus
the
eyes
of
the
older
man
followed
him
with
a
peculiar
satisfaction
they
rested
approvingly
on
the
strong
athletic
figure
on
the
bent
head
crisped
with
dark
curls
on
the
stern
brow
and
fiery
eyes
and
the
clear
features
from
my
youth
have
i
been
struggling
to
keep
the
law
with
this
one
end
in
view
continued
the
speaker
if
i
even
i
might
be
he
who
shall
by
his
holy
living
by
the
exact
fulfilling
of
the
law
of
the
almighty
bring
the
messiah
but
the
flesh
is
weak
i
know
not
how
i
have
offended
of
the
two
hundred
and
commands
and
the
three
hundred
and
prohibitions
i
have
not
broken
one
knowingly
for
many
days
but
there
has
always
been
failure
a
drop
of
unclean
water
perchance
on
the
dish
from
which
i
have
eaten
or
my
robe
has
touched
one
who
is
polluted
and
i
knew
it
not
or
i
myself
in
all
my
zeal
have
omitted
something
it
must
be
all
or
nothing
in
the
eyes
of
him
who
is
god
of
gods
infinite
unsearchable
who
knoweth
all
things
what
is
man
that
he
can
please
him
who
sitteth
on
the
circle
of
the
heavens
annas
smiled
behind
his
hand
the
zeal
of
thine
house
hath
eaten
me
up
he
quoted
piously
truly
my
son
it
giveth
me
heartfelt
joy
to
perceive
such
holy
aspirations
in
so
young
a
man
now
do
i
know
that
god
was
with
me
when
i
was
moved
to
send
for
saul
of
tarsus
as
for
me
i
am
an
old
man
i
can
no
longer
support
all
the
rigor
of
the
law
else
would
my
flesh
fail
me
behold
to
obey
is
better
than
sacrifice
and
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
rams
as
it
is
written
also
in
the
law
it
is
that
alone
to
which
i
press
forward
obedience
to
the
law
thou
knowest
why
should
i
even
speak
of
the
matter
to
thee
my
father
that
if
one
person
only
can
for
a
single
day
keep
the
whole
law
and
not
offend
in
one
point
nay
if
but
one
person
could
for
once
perfectly
keep
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
our
god
then
then
the
messiah
would
come
then
would
the
lord
dwell
once
more
among
his
people
in
visible
form
then
would
we
tread
our
enemies
under
our
feet
then
would
the
holy
of
holies
be
filled
with
glory
so
that
jerusalem
should
shine
as
a
bride
prepared
for
her
husband
oh
lord
when
shall
these
things
be
why
dost
thou
tarry
why
is
thy
holy
city
defiled
by
the
gentiles
the
speaker
paused
and
lifted
his
face
as
if
to
listen
for
some
word
from
the
unanswering
heavens
the
deep
tones
of
the
old
man
broke
the
silence
these
things
can
never
be
until
jerusalem
is
purged
of
the
followers
of
that
blasphemer
who
hath
of
late
paid
the
just
penalty
of
his
crimes
on
the
accursed
tree
take
counsel
with
me
my
son
and
i
will
tell
thee
how
thou
shalt
hasten
this
day
of
which
thou
hast
spoken
with
thine
eyes
shalt
thou
behold
and
see
the
reward
of
the
wicked
the
lord
will
not
cast
off
his
people
neither
will
he
forsake
his
he
speaks
to
thee
my
son
through
the
words
of
my
mouth
listen
therefore
judgment
shall
return
unto
righteousness
and
all
the
upright
in
heart
shall
follow
it
but
who
will
rise
up
for
me
against
the
evil
doers
who
will
stand
up
for
me
against
the
workers
of
iniquity
i
will
stand
against
the
workers
of
iniquity
answered
the
young
man
solemnly
i
will
utterly
crush
them
and
cast
them
out
even
as
did
elijah
in
the
day
when
he
slew
the
prophets
of
baal
at
the
brook
kishon
upon
thee
my
son
hath
the
mantle
of
the
prophet
fallen
and
into
thy
hand
will
i
commit
this
work
only
must
thou
submit
thyself
to
my
direction
in
the
matter
for
i
know
the
ways
of
this
people
and
of
this
city
as
thou
dost
not
listen
therefore
while
i
shall
speak
to
thee
of
what
we
must
accomplish
speak
for
my
spirit
burns
within
me
i
long
to
come
up
to
the
help
of
the
lord
against
the
mighty
thou
hast
well
said
the
mighty
my
son
for
strange
and
terrible
things
have
happened
thou
hast
already
heard
how
that
suddenly
out
of
the
hill
country
of
galilee
there
arose
a
man
called
jesus
of
nazareth
he
was
a
carpenter
and
the
son
of
a
carpenter
he
wrought
also
at
his
trade
blamelessly
enough
until
he
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
after
that
he
took
to
himself
certain
men
of
the
baser
sort
gathered
from
among
ignorant
fisher
folk
and
even
publicans
these
men
he
called
his
disciples
then
went
he
forth
and
began
to
teach
strange
and
ungodly
doctrines
to
the
people
he
taught
them
that
the
sabbath
was
not
to
be
observed
after
the
law
that
the
priests
and
rabbis
were
hypocrites
yea
he
even
said
that
we
were
as
whited
sepulchres
fair
to
look
upon
but
within
full
of
dead
men
s
bones
and
all
uncleanness
extortioners
also
he
called
us
and
unjust
and
the
speaker
s
voice
shook
with
passion
he
pretended
to
do
wondrous
miracles
and
all
manner
of
wild
tales
began
to
fill
the
mouths
of
the
common
people
even
of
our
own
number
were
led
after
him
certain
ones
joseph
of
arimathea
may
god
smite
him
and
nicodemus
also
so
thou
canst
perceive
the
cunning
of
the
evil
one
he
came
boldly
up
to
jerusalem
at
the
time
of
feasts
he
even
made
pretense
of
keeping
the
feasts
also
with
his
disciples
yet
was
he
always
undermining
the
law
and
teaching
others
so
repeatedly
did
he
heal
on
the
sabbath
day
what
meanest
thou
said
the
young
man
knitting
his
dark
brows
did
he
heal
then
of
a
truth
annas
hesitated
a
moment
he
shifted
uneasily
about
in
his
place
thou
wilt
hear
wondrous
tales
of
his
doings
he
said
at
length
dropping
his
eyes
to
the
floor
but
and
his
voice
gathered
firmness
it
is
all
lies
all
lies
the
man
paid
money
to
vile
beggars
to
pretend
that
they
were
blind
and
halt
then
forsooth
he
loosed
them
from
their
infirmities
it
was
reported
in
tarsus
that
he
had
raised
a
man
from
the
dead
said
saul
fixing
his
candid
dark
eyes
on
the
downcast
face
of
his
companion
reported
yes
i
also
heard
of
the
marvel
the
high
priest
sent
his
servant
malchus
to
inquire
into
the
matter
why
did
he
not
go
himself
what
need
the
man
was
faithful
where
is
this
malchus
i
should
like
to
speak
with
him
annas
looked
alarmed
the
man
hath
died
since
he
said
frowning
what
said
he
of
the
matter
what
could
an
honest
man
say
replied
annas
with
a
crafty
smile
can
a
carpenter
build
anew
the
life
which
god
hath
taken
out
of
a
man
but
i
have
not
told
thee
all
this
carpenter
also
declared
that
he
was
the
messiah
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
moment
broken
only
by
the
quickened
breathing
of
the
young
man
he
said
further
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
council
of
the
sanhedrim
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
the
king
of
israel
and
that
hereafter
he
would
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
to
judge
the
earth
saul
of
tarsus
sprang
to
his
feet
lightnings
played
within
his
eyes
blasphemer
he
cried
in
a
choked
voice
why
did
not
jehovah
smite
him
to
the
earth
jehovah
did
smite
him
by
the
hand
of
his
servants
not
many
hours
after
he
had
uttered
those
sayings
he
died
the
accursed
death
but
hark
i
hear
a
sound
of
turmoil
what
hath
befallen
alas
for
jerusalem
she
is
sorely
vexed
by
the
heathen
within
her
gates
ever
and
anon
the
roman
soldiers
smite
the
inhabitants
and
there
is
the
clash
of
weapons
and
the
shedding
of
blood
even
at
the
very
gates
of
the
temple
his
companion
glanced
out
of
the
window
the
people
are
running
from
every
direction
he
said
eagerly
let
us
see
what
hath
happened
go
thou
my
son
i
must
needs
sanctify
myself
for
the
temple
service
descending
into
the
street
and
following
the
steps
of
the
hurrying
stragglers
the
young
man
soon
found
himself
in
the
meaner
and
more
crowded
portions
of
the
city
here
the
narrow
streets
were
choked
with
people
all
running
pushing
struggling
towards
a
common
centre
the
pharisee
of
tarsus
shrank
back
with
disgust
into
the
doorway
of
a
synagogue
near
at
hand
and
from
this
coign
of
vantage
looked
forth
on
the
crowd
the
white
turbans
of
jewish
rabbis
the
faces
of
egyptian
camel
drivers
and
the
gay
robes
of
asiatic
merchants
all
mingled
in
the
shifting
mazes
of
the
multitude
a
jargon
of
tongues
also
like
the
buzzing
of
a
gigantic
swarm
of
bees
filled
the
air
from
somewhere
not
far
away
he
could
hear
the
loud
tones
of
a
man
s
voice
rising
and
falling
as
if
in
passionate
exhortation
what
hath
befallen
he
asked
at
length
of
a
man
dressed
in
the
garb
of
a
greek
sailor
who
like
himself
had
sought
refuge
in
the
doorway
of
the
synagogue
fire
from
heaven
hath
fallen
on
the
followers
of
the
nazarene
replied
the
man
without
looking
around
dost
thou
mean
the
followers
of
the
man
called
jesus
who
hath
lately
perished
on
the
cross
said
saul
regardless
for
once
of
the
defilement
which
he
brought
upon
himself
by
speaking
with
this
gentile
the
same
replied
the
greek
glancing
carelessly
at
his
questioner
the
man
jesus
was
a
worker
of
miracles
he
revived
after
being
buried
three
days
and
went
up
bodily
to
dwell
with
the
god
of
the
jews
dog
of
a
gentile
cried
saul
angrily
thou
art
accursed
because
thou
art
a
gentile
but
doubly
accursed
because
thou
hast
also
blasphemed
the
greek
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
i
care
for
thee
jew
he
said
showing
his
white
teeth
in
a
wicked
laugh
thou
also
art
accursed
and
thy
temple
shall
be
torn
down
so
that
not
one
stone
shall
stand
upon
another
i
heard
the
nazarene
say
it
and
by
bacchus
i
believe
it
thou
shalt
be
scourged
fellow
and
thy
scurrilous
tongue
cut
from
thy
head
hissed
saul
between
his
shut
teeth
i
am
a
roman
and
i
will
see
to
it
at
this
the
man
turned
pale
for
all
his
swarthy
skin
with
a
sudden
quick
movement
he
snatched
his
garments
from
the
grasp
of
the
pharisee
and
fled
away
into
the
crowd
doubling
and
twisting
under
the
arms
and
betwixt
the
legs
of
the
barbarians
till
he
was
lost
to
view
saul
looked
after
him
for
a
moment
in
speechless
rage
thou
art
a
stranger
then
in
jerusalem
said
a
voice
at
his
side
and
knowest
not
what
wonders
have
come
upon
the
holy
city
wonders
and
terrors
also
the
young
pharisee
turned
and
looked
at
the
speaker
he
was
a
jew
and
wore
a
broad
phylactery
upon
his
arm
i
have
heard
all
he
said
shortly
but
what
hath
befallen
the
followers
of
the
man
the
knave
yonder
said
that
fire
from
heaven
had
fallen
upon
them
i
hope
that
they
be
burned
to
ashes
as
were
the
dwellers
in
sodom
they
are
unharmed
said
the
newcomer
gravely
if
indeed
fire
hath
fallen
upon
them
it
was
a
fire
that
enlightened
their
understanding
for
even
now
they
are
preaching
to
the
people
of
the
risen
galilean
so
that
of
all
these
foreigners
every
man
hears
in
his
own
tongue
nay
son
of
abraham
cried
another
voice
the
men
are
drunken
with
new
wine
and
babble
as
is
the
custom
of
and
gluttons
saul
recognized
in
the
speaker
one
of
the
members
of
the
sanhedrim
why
then
do
ye
who
are
in
authority
suffer
such
unseemly
conduct
in
these
men
why
not
deal
with
them
also
as
thou
hast
dealt
with
their
master
thou
art
zealous
said
the
other
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
gesture
of
caution
yet
would
such
measures
be
untimely
this
indicating
the
mixed
multitude
with
a
contemptuous
wave
of
his
hand
is
a
beast
which
hath
not
been
tamed
either
by
the
church
nor
yet
by
the
romans
when
it
hath
tired
of
these
babblers
it
will
rend
them
even
as
it
rent
the
nazarene
for
it
was
this
very
multitude
that
shrieked
crucify
him
crucify
him
for
the
space
of
three
hours
come
let
us
be
going
we
defile
ourselves
by
remaining
in
this
place
chapter
viii
a
believer
in
the
nazarene
if
only
i
had
been
there
perchance
upon
even
me
might
a
little
of
the
blessing
have
fallen
and
yet
was
it
not
by
the
mercy
of
the
one
that
i
was
chained
to
the
side
of
him
who
slew
jesus
we
are
one
flesh
as
it
is
written
in
the
law
if
he
is
accursed
i
also
am
accursed
knowest
thou
our
lord
so
little
that
thou
dost
believe
what
thou
hast
said
said
stephen
a
smile
dawning
in
his
dark
eyes
the
wife
of
caiaphas
wiped
away
one
or
two
slow
tears
how
can
i
know
him
she
asked
bitterly
once
when
jesus
was
upon
earth
said
stephen
looking
away
towards
calvary
which
they
could
see
plainly
from
their
breezy
nook
on
the
terrace
he
said
this
i
did
not
hear
it
but
john
whom
jesus
called
the
beloved
one
of
the
disciples
had
asked
the
master
how
they
should
pray
and
he
told
them
the
very
words
they
might
use
acceptably
but
he
also
said
if
thou
hast
desires
bring
them
to
the
father
he
will
give
to
thee
even
as
an
earthly
father
and
much
more
if
a
child
should
come
to
his
father
and
ask
for
bread
will
that
father
offer
him
a
stone
or
if
he
crave
fish
will
he
thrust
a
deadly
scorpion
into
his
hand
how
much
more
then
will
your
heavenly
father
give
his
spirit
to
them
that
ask
him
it
was
because
we
asked
that
it
was
given
thou
also
shalt
ask
and
shalt
receive
wilt
thou
tell
me
about
it
said
anna
in
a
low
voice
fixing
her
eyes
wistfully
upon
the
speaker
he
was
no
longer
a
lad
she
could
see
it
the
awful
experiences
through
which
his
soul
had
passed
had
swept
him
suddenly
and
forever
away
from
childhood
his
child
nature
had
been
crucified
with
those
whom
he
loved
and
upon
his
face
there
had
come
a
look
such
as
the
strong
young
angels
wear
who
wait
in
the
presence
of
the
almighty
to
do
his
pleasure
we
were
together
in
the
upper
room
said
stephen
after
a
little
silence
the
disciples
the
mother
of
jesus
and
all
the
others
after
we
had
eaten
of
the
bread
and
drunken
of
the
wine
also
he
commanded
to
do
in
remembrance
of
his
death
we
continued
in
prayer
sometimes
spoken
sometimes
in
silence
for
there
is
no
need
to
speak
aloud
to
reach
him
who
is
with
us
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
he
was
there
though
we
could
not
see
him
all
of
us
knew
it
and
we
asked
him
for
the
fulfilment
of
his
last
promise
the
spirit
that
we
being
weak
might
receive
power
to
be
his
witnesses
before
men
john
the
beloved
spoke
to
him
after
that
there
was
silence
for
a
brief
space
then
on
a
sudden
there
came
a
sound
faint
at
first
but
growing
louder
by
degrees
till
it
filled
all
the
place
it
was
like
nothing
i
have
heard
upon
earth
and
yet
was
it
most
like
the
sound
of
the
viewless
wind
when
it
rushes
through
the
thick
forest
but
it
was
not
wind
i
knelt
at
the
side
of
the
lord
s
mother
my
eyes
were
upon
her
at
the
moment
and
the
light
tresses
that
fell
about
her
forehead
did
not
so
much
as
stir
was
that
all
whispered
anna
leaning
forward
and
clasping
her
hands
as
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
mary
continued
stephen
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
looking
at
him
i
saw
form
in
the
air
above
her
head
a
tremulous
light
it
wavered
and
brightened
till
it
had
the
look
of
a
cloven
tongue
of
flame
as
i
feared
and
trembled
greatly
at
the
sight
on
a
sudden
a
voice
cried
out
the
promise
hath
been
fulfilled
unto
us
then
did
i
see
that
upon
every
head
hovered
the
heavenly
fire
and
then
and
then
cried
the
young
man
a
great
joy
in
the
solemn
tones
of
his
voice
all
things
were
made
clear
to
us
we
knew
what
the
lord
meant
when
he
said
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
both
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
judea
and
in
samaria
and
unto
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
we
were
no
longer
filled
with
fear
thinking
only
how
to
escape
the
hands
of
them
that
had
murdered
our
lord
nay
rather
that
in
the
infinite
and
unsearchable
knowledge
and
wisdom
of
the
father
had
lifted
him
up
upon
the
cross
to
be
a
light
unto
the
world
we
rushed
out
into
the
street
and
the
spirit
also
drew
together
out
of
all
the
city
devout
men
from
every
nation
under
heaven
they
gathered
in
a
great
multitude
that
they
might
hear
of
the
saviour
not
of
the
jews
only
but
of
the
world
how
then
could
they
understand
asked
anna
her
worn
face
reflecting
the
glow
upon
the
face
of
the
young
man
as
the
mountain
top
clad
in
its
pallor
of
eternal
snow
reflects
the
radiance
of
the
dawn
what
is
the
weakness
of
mortal
understanding
when
the
eternal
god
sheds
upon
it
his
spirit
of
might
did
he
not
make
the
tongue
of
the
asiatic
as
well
as
the
tongue
of
the
greek
the
tongues
of
the
parthians
medes
and
elamites
also
as
well
as
the
tongue
of
the
hebrews
are
not
all
languages
understood
by
him
he
spake
through
us
and
behold
every
man
heard
the
message
in
his
own
language
after
that
did
peter
speak
unto
the
people
and
he
mightily
convinced
them
so
that
many
cried
out
what
shall
we
do
repent
and
be
baptized
he
answered
them
every
one
of
you
in
the
name
of
jesus
the
christ
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
ye
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
for
the
promise
is
unto
you
and
to
your
children
and
to
all
that
are
afar
off
said
he
this
to
the
gentiles
asked
anna
in
amaze
stephen
looked
troubled
nay
he
said
i
know
not
if
they
were
gentiles
they
had
by
inheritance
a
part
in
the
blessing
even
as
i
had
through
my
mother
but
of
a
surety
god
created
all
men
it
will
be
made
plain
to
us
he
added
after
a
pause
a
smile
of
heavenly
sweetness
touching
his
lips
and
who
is
it
that
the
wife
of
the
high
priest
honors
thus
with
her
hospitality
broke
in
a
sneering
voice
anna
started
up
with
a
faint
cry
her
eyes
fixed
with
manifest
terror
on
the
gaunt
figure
that
stood
before
them
ah
thou
dost
not
answer
didst
thou
think
then
that
i
should
remain
chained
to
my
couch
forever
i
am
minded
to
see
what
is
passing
in
my
house
it
is
time
do
not
stand
gasped
anna
thou
art
not
strong
i
thought
that
thou
wast
asleep
time
hasteneth
with
rapid
foot
when
a
lady
entertains
so
comely
a
young
man
said
the
high
priest
with
a
terrible
gentleness
once
more
i
ask
of
thee
who
is
thy
guest
stephen
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
looking
with
troubled
eyes
into
the
face
of
her
whom
he
had
learned
to
love
almost
as
a
mother
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
her
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
he
turned
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
man
i
know
not
who
thou
art
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
nor
why
thou
dost
question
this
beloved
lady
so
harshly
but
i
can
answer
for
myself
my
name
is
stephen
the
high
priest
took
a
step
forward
he
did
not
speak
but
death
looked
out
from
his
eyes
go
go
whispered
anna
turning
her
white
face
upon
the
young
man
thou
dost
not
understand
but
go
i
beseech
thee
nay
i
will
not
go
till
i
am
assured
of
thy
safety
who
and
what
manner
of
man
is
this
the
smouldering
fire
in
the
eyes
of
caiaphas
leapt
up
into
a
lurid
blaze
dost
thou
the
murderer
of
my
son
defy
me
in
mine
own
house
he
cried
in
a
choked
voice
because
thou
art
in
mine
house
i
will
not
kill
thee
but
and
his
voice
died
away
into
a
silence
more
terrible
than
speech
go
repeated
anna
imploringly
but
stephen
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
what
dost
thou
mean
he
said
his
voice
full
of
horror
thou
hast
called
me
a
murderer
the
high
priest
looked
at
him
contemptuously
son
of
a
malefactor
dost
thou
not
know
that
upon
thy
head
rests
the
of
thy
father
no
thundered
stephen
his
eyes
blazing
the
fire
of
god
could
not
rest
upon
a
head
whereon
is
also
i
am
innocent
god
hath
witnessed
it
accursed
murderer
and
blasphemer
hissed
caiaphas
get
thee
hence
or
not
even
the
sacred
law
of
hospitality
shall
refrain
my
hand
from
thy
throat
then
he
sank
trembling
onto
a
bench
true
to
her
wifely
instincts
anna
sprang
to
help
him
but
he
put
her
away
roughly
stand
before
me
woman
he
said
fixing
his
savage
eyes
upon
her
thou
shalt
answer
me
somewhat
that
i
shall
ask
of
thee
now
that
the
murderer
of
thy
son
hath
rid
us
of
his
presence
thou
canst
perhaps
attend
to
what
i
shall
say
anna
stood
before
him
motionless
and
rigid
her
eyes
wide
with
an
unnatural
calm
fixed
upon
his
face
hast
thou
known
who
and
what
this
young
man
is
before
yes
hast
thou
before
received
him
into
my
house
yes
is
he
a
follower
of
the
accursed
nazarene
yes
art
thou
also
one
of
his
believers
a
change
swept
over
the
marble
features
of
the
woman
she
lifted
her
face
a
mysterious
light
from
above
seemed
to
shine
upon
it
i
am
she
said
simply
but
in
those
two
words
there
sounded
a
very
pean
of
triumph
flesh
of
my
flesh
and
bone
of
my
bone
said
caiaphas
in
a
low
measured
voice
thou
art
anathema
as
i
would
cut
off
my
right
hand
should
it
become
polluted
beyond
cleansing
so
also
will
i
sever
thee
from
my
life
get
thee
hence
unto
thine
own
thou
hast
no
longer
part
nor
lot
with
me
from
henceforth
and
even
forever
and
so
let
it
be
the
woman
looked
dumbly
into
the
pitiless
face
of
the
man
before
her
her
slight
figure
swayed
a
little
then
noiselessly
as
a
snow
wreath
she
fell
forward
and
lay
prone
upon
the
marble
pavement
at
his
feet
the
man
stared
at
the
silent
figure
he
did
not
touch
it
after
a
time
he
arose
and
walked
heavily
away
without
once
looking
behind
him
chapter
ix
in
the
desert
encampment
thou
mayest
fetch
the
lad
and
the
maiden
and
set
them
in
my
presence
i
would
question
them
of
this
thing
the
woman
bowed
herself
humbly
before
her
lord
and
retired
presently
she
returned
leading
by
the
hand
a
slight
figure
clad
in
the
shapeless
blue
gown
of
an
egyptian
peasant
girl
behind
lagged
with
unwilling
feet
a
lad
abu
ben
hesed
fixed
his
piercing
eyes
upon
the
twain
thou
mayest
go
till
i
shall
call
thee
he
said
to
the
woman
she
lingered
yet
a
moment
to
whisper
the
maid
is
blind
my
lord
come
hither
my
son
said
ben
hesed
after
a
short
survey
of
his
two
guests
and
tell
me
how
it
befell
that
thou
wast
in
the
desert
alone
didst
thou
know
he
added
somewhat
severely
that
thou
wast
brought
to
the
borders
of
the
encampment
only
that
thou
mightest
be
buried
safe
from
the
vultures
had
not
one
of
the
women
discerned
signs
of
life
when
no
other
eye
could
see
it
thou
wouldst
even
now
be
sleeping
beneath
the
sand
the
boy
shuddered
slightly
he
opened
his
lips
as
though
to
speak
but
the
girl
broke
out
impetuously
i
alone
am
in
fault
she
cried
it
was
i
who
would
not
listen
to
my
brother
when
he
said
we
shall
perish
by
the
way
if
we
go
forth
into
the
it
is
true
she
continued
turning
to
the
lad
folly
dwelleth
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
i
am
minded
to
let
thee
beat
me
i
have
deserved
it
abu
ben
hesed
smiled
in
the
midst
of
his
great
beard
but
the
smile
looked
also
out
of
his
eyes
so
that
the
lad
was
emboldened
to
speak
we
fled
before
the
face
of
an
enemy
he
said
looking
squarely
into
the
bright
eyes
of
the
man
before
him
he
would
have
made
slaves
of
us
in
the
city
death
in
the
wilderness
is
better
thou
hast
spoken
a
word
of
wisdom
when
thou
hast
so
said
my
son
cried
ben
hesed
his
eyes
flashing
and
who
is
it
that
would
have
caged
the
wild
eaglets
of
the
desert
i
know
not
replied
the
lad
i
saw
not
the
man
i
only
heard
him
speak
we
were
hidden
in
the
abiding
place
of
the
dead
he
would
have
shut
us
up
there
to
perish
but
sechet
smote
him
in
the
act
and
we
left
him
on
his
face
in
the
sand
thou
art
egyptian
said
ben
hesed
after
a
pause
how
comes
it
that
thou
canst
speak
the
tongue
of
the
desert
it
was
my
mother
s
language
my
father
was
a
greek
where
then
are
thy
parents
dead
many
years
dead
said
the
boy
looking
down
and
digging
his
bare
toes
into
the
hot
sand
a
single
tear
rolled
swiftly
down
his
brown
cheek
ben
hesed
saw
it
his
keen
eyes
softened
no
longer
shalt
thou
look
for
a
place
to
bide
in
safety
from
thine
enemy
he
said
gently
where
else
should
the
young
eaglets
fly
but
to
the
nest
of
their
kind
thou
art
safe
here
my
children
thou
art
good
replied
the
lad
simply
but
my
sister
is
blind
i
am
not
ignorant
of
that
my
son
said
ben
hesed
with
a
stately
inclination
of
his
head
there
is
no
need
that
she
labor
with
her
hands
plenty
dwells
within
the
borders
of
my
land
though
it
be
not
the
plenty
of
egypt
there
is
no
lack
of
either
flesh
nor
bread
nor
yet
of
the
milk
of
many
herds
thou
art
strong
son
and
thou
shalt
labor
as
becomes
a
man
the
maid
shall
dwell
with
the
women
go
now
in
peace
and
think
of
thy
past
distresses
no
more
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
token
of
dismissal
come
anat
said
the
lad
drawing
her
gently
away
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
repay
thee
thy
goodness
he
added
lingering
wistfully
yet
there
is
no
need
said
ben
hesed
a
slight
shade
of
impatience
in
his
tone
go
now
my
son
will
tell
thee
of
thy
duties
nay
brother
do
not
hold
me
i
must
tell
him
cried
anat
we
can
not
remain
here
how
now
damsel
art
thou
not
satisfied
with
what
thou
hast
received
at
my
hands
and
ben
hesed
drew
his
bushy
brows
together
with
the
look
before
which
his
wives
his
children
and
his
tribe
were
wont
to
tremble
seth
also
trembled
i
pray
thee
my
lord
he
said
instinctively
bowing
himself
almost
to
the
ground
that
thou
wilt
not
deal
harshly
with
the
maid
my
sister
she
is
blind
and
we
were
seeking
a
great
magician
who
can
heal
blindness
by
a
word
thou
knowest
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
not
to
look
upon
the
sun
and
upon
the
stars
and
upon
the
faces
of
one
s
kind
ben
hesed
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
looked
keenly
into
the
lad
s
flushed
face
it
is
in
egypt
that
the
magicians
dwell
he
said
at
length
hast
thou
not
heard
how
moses
the
mighty
man
of
god
fetched
out
the
israelites
with
a
strong
hand
from
among
the
egyptians
how
he
worked
marvels
also
and
great
plagues
with
the
rod
of
god
and
the
magicians
of
egypt
did
so
with
their
enchantments
save
certain
things
which
they
could
not
do
i
know
not
moses
said
the
boy
shaking
his
head
though
i
have
heard
many
marvels
of
the
great
gods
of
the
greeks
and
romans
also
yet
is
there
no
magician
in
egypt
who
can
cure
blindness
for
the
land
is
full
of
it
and
wherefore
didst
thou
look
for
this
magician
in
the
wilderness
the
man
said
that
he
dwelt
beyond
the
wilderness
and
that
his
name
was
jesus
said
anat
in
her
low
sweet
voice
i
have
not
forgotten
the
name
jesus
he
healed
the
man
he
will
also
heal
me
if
only
i
can
find
him
ben
hesed
fingered
his
beard
for
a
time
in
silence
what
manner
of
man
was
he
that
told
thee
of
this
thing
he
said
at
length
he
came
out
of
the
desert
on
a
swift
dromedary
replied
seth
he
was
of
great
stature
and
his
beard
descended
upon
his
breast
i
gave
him
to
drink
of
my
he
said
moreover
that
the
magician
dwelt
at
jerusalem
a
year
ago
i
went
up
to
the
holy
city
said
ben
hesed
that
i
might
offer
sacrifices
in
the
temple
i
care
not
to
go
again
god
is
a
god
of
the
wilderness
he
answers
also
in
the
wilderness
of
the
rocks
of
the
desert
have
i
builded
me
an
altar
even
as
did
abraham
in
the
days
of
old
jerusalem
is
desolate
and
her
holy
places
are
waste
why
should
i
go
any
more
into
a
temple
which
is
daily
defiled
by
the
feet
of
wicked
men
the
voice
of
the
speaker
shook
with
passion
as
he
said
the
last
words
then
his
head
dropped
upon
his
breast
and
his
lips
moved
though
no
sound
came
from
them
the
children
waited
before
him
in
silence
not
daring
to
move
after
what
seemed
to
her
a
long
time
anat
allowed
a
sigh
to
escape
her
by
way
of
a
delicate
reminder
of
their
presence
thou
wast
in
jerusalem
she
ventured
timidly
ben
hesed
looked
up
something
in
the
beauty
and
innocence
of
the
guarded
by
its
pathetic
unseeing
eyes
moved
him
strangely
the
gloom
lifted
from
his
brow
i
was
in
jerusalem
he
said
gravely
and
i
saw
this
man
jesus
with
mine
own
eyes
anat
clasped
her
hands
joyfully
ah
then
thou
canst
tell
us
of
him
dost
thou
think
that
he
would
heal
me
i
have
no
money
nor
treasure
to
give
him
except
this
and
she
laid
her
fingers
on
the
necklace
of
coins
he
would
not
ask
thee
for
treasure
my
child
said
ben
hesed
for
i
saw
him
heal
a
beggar
who
lay
upon
his
bed
unable
to
move
and
the
man
gave
him
no
reward
i
came
away
from
jerusalem
in
that
same
hour
and
saw
him
no
more
i
have
thought
since
that
sometime
i
will
again
seek
for
him
though
i
need
not
to
be
healed
it
is
a
good
word
that
thou
hast
given
to
us
said
anat
in
a
tone
of
joyful
conviction
and
now
wilt
thou
further
give
a
handful
of
parched
corn
that
we
may
eat
by
the
way
my
brother
will
fill
the
with
water
and
we
will
depart
art
thou
not
afraid
of
the
vultures
little
one
asked
ben
hesed
with
a
grave
smile
and
how
will
the
flint
of
the
desert
bruise
those
tender
feet
of
thine
now
that
thy
beast
is
dead
seth
looked
depressed
we
can
not
go
he
said
at
length
my
is
not
sufficient
and
we
do
not
know
the
way
nay
but
we
must
go
cried
anat
impetuously
i
care
not
for
the
vultures
and
we
have
already
come
a
great
distance
did
i
whine
or
complain
when
we
thirsted
thou
didst
not
but
could
i
bear
again
to
see
thee
sink
to
the
earth
thy
tongue
like
a
parched
leaf
within
thy
mouth
and
the
vultures
thou
could
st
not
see
them
but
it
was
horrible
horrible
they
stared
at
us
with
their
red
eyes
they
waited
for
us
to
die
i
kept
up
as
long
as
i
was
able
and
drove
them
away
then
did
i
call
aloud
upon
the
god
of
the
land
to
save
us
after
that
i
hid
our
faces
and
waited
for
anubis
to
take
us
the
god
of
the
land
heard
thee
boy
said
ben
hesed
solemnly
for
he
is
not
a
god
like
to
the
gods
of
the
egyptians
he
saved
thee
even
as
he
saved
the
child
ishmael
whom
abraham
cast
forth
into
the
desert
to
die
in
the
desert
also
did
the
child
ishmael
remain
and
god
made
out
of
him
a
great
nation
which
hath
ruled
over
the
wilderness
until
this
day
ay
and
shall
rule
as
long
as
the
desert
itself
remains
for
his
word
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
listen
now
to
what
i
shall
say
unto
thee
thou
shalt
go
in
search
of
this
man
jesus
for
i
believe
that
he
is
able
to
do
this
thing
whereof
thou
hast
spoken
i
will
send
thee
to
the
borders
of
judæa
with
food
and
water
and
beasts
of
burden
also
that
ye
perish
not
by
the
way
after
that
shall
ye
with
ease
find
jerusalem
for
the
way
is
not
long
and
the
land
is
fertile
enter
freely
into
the
villages
and
ask
for
bread
the
inhabitants
will
not
say
thee
nay
and
when
the
maid
shall
be
healed
of
her
blindness
perchance
thou
wilt
again
remember
the
wilderness
return
if
thou
wilt
shalt
thou
set
forth
i
will
return
my
lord
said
the
lad
and
by
all
the
gods
of
the
sacred
nile
i
swear
unto
thee
that
hereafter
i
will
serve
thee
as
a
bondman
during
the
years
of
my
life
if
it
be
thy
will
because
thou
hast
saved
us
from
death
and
because
of
all
thy
goodness
unto
us
nay
rather
thou
shalt
be
to
me
in
the
place
of
my
son
eri
whom
god
hath
taken
from
me
said
ben
hesed
go
now
in
peace
and
rest
until
the
morning
so
the
two
were
feasted
that
night
because
that
they
had
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
ben
hesed
and
afterward
they
slept
soundly
in
the
tent
of
goat
s
hair
beneath
the
striped
blanket
with
which
they
had
hidden
themselves
from
the
fierce
eyes
of
vultures
and
seth
dreamed
that
he
had
grown
to
be
a
man
and
that
he
was
riding
upon
a
swift
horse
the
wild
desert
winds
blowing
in
his
face
and
he
laughed
aloud
in
his
dream
for
joy
but
to
the
blind
girl
came
a
gentler
vision
of
one
who
laid
a
healing
hand
upon
her
sightless
eyes
and
behold
she
saw
the
face
of
him
that
had
healed
her
but
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
mortal
for
upon
it
shone
a
light
beyond
the
light
of
the
sun
chapter
x
the
white
dromedary
long
before
the
first
streaks
of
light
in
the
east
proclaimed
the
dawn
seth
was
awake
outside
he
could
hear
the
grunting
of
the
sleepy
camels
as
their
drivers
aroused
them
to
fasten
the
heavy
loads
on
their
patient
backs
he
raised
the
flap
of
the
tent
and
looked
out
a
keen
sparkle
of
stars
overhead
and
a
whiff
of
cold
air
greeted
him
yet
he
knew
that
it
must
be
near
the
time
to
start
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
boyish
excitement
at
the
prospect
among
the
dark
figures
which
were
moving
about
near
the
dying
fire
he
thought
he
could
distinguish
that
of
ben
hesed
himself
presently
he
slipped
out
leaving
anat
peacefully
asleep
shivering
a
little
in
the
cool
breeze
he
made
his
way
towards
the
place
where
the
most
active
preparations
were
in
full
tide
of
progress
make
haste
he
heard
in
the
authoritative
tones
of
ben
hesed
s
voice
thou
shouldst
have
prepared
the
last
night
feasting
is
good
but
fasting
is
better
since
it
giveth
diligence
rather
than
sloth
i
would
not
that
ye
press
on
through
the
fiercest
of
the
midday
heat
he
added
the
maid
hath
imperfectly
recovered
as
yet
they
will
walk
with
the
drivers
my
lord
nay
not
so
thou
shalt
put
the
saddle
upon
mirah
it
will
suffice
for
both
marvelling
greatly
at
this
mark
of
favor
the
men
brought
the
great
white
dromedary
the
favorite
of
her
master
and
threw
upon
her
the
broad
saddle
gay
with
scarlet
leather
and
tinkling
bells
seth
stared
with
amazement
and
delight
at
the
docile
beast
that
stood
with
outstretched
neck
snuffing
at
the
fresh
wind
what
dost
thou
make
of
such
favor
to
these
beggar
brats
said
one
of
the
men
in
low
tones
to
his
companion
as
he
bent
to
fasten
the
saddle
girth
nay
i
know
not
tis
a
marvel
answered
the
other
looking
cautiously
about
him
adah
told
me
last
night
that
he
had
promised
to
take
the
lad
after
his
return
in
the
place
of
his
son
eri
ah
sayest
thou
so
let
me
tell
thee
then
that
the
lad
will
not
return
why
should
such
a
thing
be
when
the
son
of
his
sister
is
among
his
tried
followers
what
wilt
thou
do
to
prevent
it
son
of
my
lord
s
sister
said
the
other
with
a
low
chuckle
and
a
kid
slain
also
in
the
very
midst
of
the
mourning
that
the
heathen
beggars
might
be
feasted
he
added
with
malicious
enjoyment
seth
prudently
drew
back
in
the
darkness
quite
unnoticed
but
not
before
a
fragment
of
the
reply
reached
him
it
was
this
and
it
filled
him
with
vague
alarms
what
befell
the
lad
joseph
in
the
days
when
he
dreamed
dreams
may
also
again
happen
who
was
the
lad
joseph
he
wondered
and
what
befell
him
but
he
presently
forgot
this
in
the
bustle
and
excitement
of
starting
forth
upon
their
journey
anat
had
been
aroused
and
the
two
perched
securely
on
the
back
of
the
gentle
mirah
were
the
centre
of
a
group
of
women
some
of
whom
held
up
their
little
ones
to
see
while
others
pushed
parcels
of
fruit
into
the
hand
of
the
blind
girl
wishing
them
prosperity
in
their
journeyings
at
length
all
was
ready
the
last
strap
adjusted
the
last
farewell
spoken
and
the
little
cavalcade
consisting
of
some
three
or
four
camels
and
as
many
men
moved
slowly
away
followed
by
the
stately
mirah
the
two
children
unaccustomed
to
the
peculiar
swinging
motion
of
her
gait
clinging
fast
to
the
saddle
and
scarcely
remembering
to
look
back
into
the
kind
faces
of
their
rescuers
all
that
day
they
traveled
stopping
only
for
a
brief
space
at
the
noontide
hour
seth
remembering
the
command
of
ben
hesed
wondered
a
little
at
this
but
he
said
nothing
in
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
in
command
of
the
expedition
the
lad
had
recognized
with
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
the
one
who
had
spoken
the
mysterious
words
what
befell
the
lad
joseph
may
also
again
happen
hast
thou
ever
heard
of
the
lad
joseph
he
said
to
anat
when
they
were
once
more
under
way
they
had
grown
somewhat
accustomed
to
the
long
swinging
strides
of
the
dromedary
now
and
were
consequently
more
at
their
ease
the
lad
joseph
repeated
anat
in
her
clear
penetrating
voice
hist
do
not
let
them
hear
thee
yes
the
lad
joseph
something
strange
befell
him
it
is
a
legend
perhaps
i
heard
it
spoken
of
in
yonder
encampment
thou
knowest
many
such
tales
for
myself
i
have
no
mind
to
remember
them
there
is
the
great
canal
of
joseph
in
the
land
of
egypt
as
thou
knowest
said
anat
after
a
few
moments
of
thought
there
is
a
tale
concerning
him
who
caused
it
to
be
made
i
know
not
how
long
ago
i
have
heard
it
many
times
from
our
mother
he
was
a
great
prince
nay
then
he
was
not
the
one
it
is
of
the
lad
joseph
and
what
befell
him
that
i
wish
to
know
broke
in
seth
impatiently
if
thou
wilt
hold
thy
peace
replied
anat
with
dignity
i
will
tell
thee
the
tale
as
it
was
told
me
thou
mayest
say
on
it
will
help
pass
away
the
time
he
was
a
great
prince
resumed
anat
still
with
dignity
but
he
was
also
a
lad
first
i
had
the
tale
from
our
mother
as
i
have
said
it
was
told
to
her
when
she
was
a
maid
and
dwelt
in
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
it
is
a
true
tale
as
a
lad
this
joseph
dwelt
in
the
wilderness
the
youngest
of
twelve
brethren
the
others
were
grown
men
they
hated
joseph
and
were
envious
of
him
because
their
father
who
was
very
rich
gave
him
many
things
which
they
received
not
an
embroidered
tunic
a
chain
of
silver
and
such
like
the
lad
also
dreamed
dreams
ah
exclaimed
seth
eagerly
he
dreamed
sayest
thou
of
a
surety
replied
the
blind
girl
he
dreamed
that
when
he
bound
his
sheaf
at
harvest
time
the
sheaves
of
his
father
and
mother
and
of
his
brethren
came
and
bowed
themselves
before
it
and
other
dreams
of
the
like
which
signified
that
he
would
become
a
great
prince
and
that
all
they
of
his
household
should
do
reverence
before
him
he
should
not
have
told
such
dreams
she
added
sagely
for
of
course
his
brothers
only
hated
him
the
more
one
day
he
was
sent
into
the
wilderness
to
fetch
dates
and
honey
to
the
eleven
men
his
brothers
who
were
herding
the
flocks
they
saw
him
coming
wearing
his
fine
tunic
and
they
made
up
their
minds
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
what
did
they
do
said
seth
breathlessly
i
was
just
coming
to
that
impatient
one
canst
thou
not
hold
thy
peace
thou
art
as
greedy
over
this
tale
as
a
flock
of
sparrows
over
a
measure
of
corn
that
hath
been
spilled
on
the
ground
i
will
hold
my
peace
queen
of
my
soul
said
seth
meekly
only
i
pray
thee
tell
me
what
befell
the
lad
somewhat
appeased
by
his
humble
demeanor
the
imperious
little
maid
proceeded
with
her
story
first
she
continued
impressively
they
thought
that
they
would
kill
him
and
take
his
fine
tunic
home
and
tell
their
father
that
a
beast
had
slain
him
but
just
as
they
were
turning
the
matter
over
in
their
minds
they
spied
a
caravan
coming
towards
them
so
they
changed
their
wicked
purpose
to
a
wickeder
yet
and
sold
him
for
a
slave
yes
their
own
brother
for
a
slave
she
repeated
much
gratified
by
the
involuntary
cry
which
her
listener
gave
at
this
they
took
him
to
egypt
she
went
on
but
seth
did
not
hear
the
remainder
of
the
story
he
was
clenching
his
brown
hands
in
silent
anguish
of
soul
it
was
all
clear
to
him
now
they
were
to
be
sold
as
slaves
after
all
of
their
sufferings
and
dangers
they
would
never
see
the
holy
city
nor
the
man
jesus
who
could
heal
blindness
he
groaned
aloud
anat
in
the
full
tide
of
her
narrative
mistook
this
for
a
note
of
admiration
or
wonder
she
had
just
arrived
at
the
point
in
her
story
where
the
unfortunate
hero
is
cast
into
prison
what
wouldst
thou
have
done
then
she
asked
abruptly
i
i
am
sure
i
can
not
tell
thee
little
one
answered
seth
rousing
himself
with
difficulty
thou
wouldst
have
remained
there
till
the
day
of
thy
death
no
doubt
with
superb
scorn
but
not
so
joseph
he
i
am
drowsy
little
one
sechet
rages
fiercely
in
the
heavens
let
us
leave
the
tale
till
said
seth
in
a
smothered
voice
anat
touched
his
cheek
with
a
cautious
forefinger
it
is
true
thy
flesh
hath
heat
see
i
have
here
a
pomegranate
thou
shalt
eat
of
it
and
be
refreshed
after
this
the
travelers
spoke
but
little
tirelessly
the
white
dromedary
strode
onward
under
the
blinding
glare
of
the
sun
her
broad
feet
making
no
sound
on
the
yielding
sand
the
landscape
quivered
in
the
intense
heat
melting
into
golden
pink
and
violet
fires
in
the
far
distances
while
near
at
hand
the
scarlet
blooms
of
the
cactus
glowed
like
live
coals
once
they
came
upon
a
flock
of
vultures
gorging
themselves
upon
the
carcass
of
a
camel
they
rose
with
hoarse
croakings
and
withdrew
themselves
to
a
little
distance
till
the
living
should
pass
by
as
yet
we
have
no
concern
with
thee
they
seemed
to
say
to
the
white
dromedary
but
so
shall
it
be
with
thee
also
for
man
is
ungrateful
then
they
again
descended
a
dismal
crew
upon
the
stranded
wreck
of
the
desert
ship
and
the
stately
mirah
strode
onward
tirelessly
that
night
they
pitched
a
tent
and
built
a
fire
of
the
dried
shrubs
the
man
pagiel
spoke
roughly
to
the
children
he
bade
the
lad
gather
the
fuel
as
for
the
maid
he
pushed
her
aside
with
his
foot
as
though
she
were
a
dog
seth
s
eyes
burned
when
he
saw
the
thing
but
he
said
nothing
he
thought
instead
the
white
dromedary
crouched
upon
the
sand
chewing
her
cud
her
large
eyes
fixed
thoughtfully
upon
the
distance
the
boy
approached
her
cautiously
and
caressed
her
snowy
neck
the
beast
permitted
it
with
a
low
sound
in
her
throat
that
wouldst
thou
not
venture
with
every
beast
in
the
flock
said
one
of
the
men
they
be
ugly
save
with
those
who
know
them
yonder
camel
can
be
touched
by
no
other
save
jered
his
driver
but
mirah
there
is
of
another
sort
i
have
seen
my
lord
s
little
ones
climb
upon
her
back
when
they
were
babes
for
speed
she
is
a
marvel
thou
hast
not
seen
it
for
the
camels
travel
but
slowly
she
can
outrun
them
then
said
seth
his
heart
beating
violently
assuredly
boy
there
is
nothing
swifter
save
the
wind
fetch
fuel
beggar
cried
pagiel
accompanying
his
words
with
a
fierce
look
and
do
thou
afterward
get
into
the
tent
and
sleep
thou
and
the
girl
why
dost
thou
speak
thus
harshly
to
the
lad
questioned
the
other
after
seth
had
withdrawn
in
obedience
to
the
command
he
is
a
heathen
beggar
why
should
he
receive
kindness
at
my
hand
listen
we
come
to
the
fountain
of
hodesh
tis
but
a
day
s
march
from
the
river
we
will
tarry
there
till
a
caravan
shall
pass
by
then
will
we
sell
the
lad
and
the
maiden
for
gold
the
gold
shalt
thou
divide
between
the
three
of
you
and
thou
shalt
say
naught
to
ben
hesed
concerning
the
matter
it
will
pass
from
his
mind
even
as
the
mist
dissolves
before
the
rising
sun
but
thou
shalt
have
that
wherewith
to
comfort
thyself
the
man
listened
with
bent
brows
what
is
comfort
to
me
he
said
sullenly
if
i
have
not
thy
daughter
to
wife
she
is
comely
and
i
love
her
better
than
gold
pagiel
stared
at
the
speaker
with
amazement
thou
hast
forgotten
thyself
he
said
haughtily
nay
i
have
not
forgotten
thou
art
the
son
of
my
lord
s
sister
i
am
the
son
of
kish
the
herdsman
yet
in
the
desert
what
matters
it
am
i
not
a
man
like
unto
thee
pagiel
was
silent
a
moment
it
shall
be
so
he
said
at
length
it
is
true
thou
art
a
man
and
my
daughter
is
after
all
only
a
woman
i
have
sons
also
thanks
be
to
jehovah
and
the
gold
shall
be
for
the
maid
s
dowry
in
addition
to
what
she
hath
already
thou
hast
dealt
graciously
with
me
my
lord
i
am
henceforth
as
thy
son
and
as
thy
son
will
i
obey
thee
on
the
morrow
they
came
to
the
fountain
of
hodesh
and
they
encamped
there
waiting
for
a
caravan
on
the
third
day
during
the
heat
of
the
noontide
the
men
slept
within
the
tent
but
seth
rose
up
softly
and
went
out
he
filled
his
goat
skin
at
the
fountain
and
bound
it
upon
his
back
he
took
also
of
the
parched
corn
a
small
measure
and
of
the
dates
a
double
handful
for
he
said
to
himself
it
was
for
us
that
these
things
were
given
by
the
lord
of
the
desert
why
dost
thou
fill
thy
brother
said
anat
hearing
the
familiar
tinkle
of
the
brasses
wake
not
the
men
yonder
answered
seth
in
a
cautious
whisper
they
would
deal
with
us
after
the
manner
of
the
brethren
of
joseph
we
will
get
us
away
upon
the
white
dromedary
nor
shall
they
be
able
to
overtake
us
so
the
two
went
softly
to
where
mirah
crouched
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
palms
and
they
climbed
upon
her
back
it
is
a
good
thing
for
us
that
pagiel
commanded
her
to
be
saddled
quoth
seth
he
had
the
intent
to
ride
after
his
sleep
then
he
spoke
softly
in
the
ear
of
the
beast
after
the
fashion
of
her
driver
and
she
rose
up
with
them
and
went
silently
away
into
the
desert
towards
the
range
of
hills
beyond
which
lay
the
land
of
judæa
but
pagiel
awaked
out
of
his
sleep
and
stood
in
the
door
of
his
tent
and
when
he
saw
the
dromedary
fleeing
away
he
made
a
great
outcry
and
awakened
the
others
also
and
they
pursued
after
them
for
many
hours
but
they
were
not
able
to
overtake
them
because
the
gentle
mirah
was
very
swift
anon
she
disappeared
from
before
their
eyes
like
a
white
sail
on
the
distant
verge
of
the
sea
when
pagiel
saw
that
she
was
gone
bearing
the
two
whom
he
would
have
sold
into
slavery
he
tore
his
beard
and
wept
with
rage
because
he
had
promised
his
daughter
to
the
son
of
kish
the
herdsman
for
he
feared
his
women
notwithstanding
he
was
a
man
and
of
great
stature
chapter
xi
at
the
gate
beautiful
the
long
hours
of
the
morning
had
worn
themselves
away
the
sunshine
had
ceased
to
glitter
on
the
wonderful
carved
brass
of
the
great
gate
shushan
some
three
hours
since
one
without
standing
on
the
marble
pavement
might
admire
the
marvels
of
corinthian
workmanship
without
an
undue
dazzling
of
the
vision
so
also
might
the
lame
man
who
lay
on
his
mat
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
entrance
yet
was
he
paying
scant
heed
to
the
grandeur
of
his
surroundings
he
lay
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
which
was
called
beautiful
not
because
it
was
beautiful
but
because
through
it
passed
a
stream
of
worshippers
to
and
from
the
ceaseless
services
of
prayer
and
praise
within
these
all
carried
their
money
within
their
hand
since
it
was
not
lawful
to
enter
the
sacred
enclosure
having
one
s
gold
or
silver
within
a
purse
nor
indeed
anywhere
about
the
person
save
in
the
hand
only
so
the
lame
man
profited
by
the
law
inasmuch
as
many
cast
a
coin
into
his
bosom
who
might
otherwise
have
been
in
too
much
haste
for
prayer
to
have
fetched
out
their
purses
for
a
beggar
on
this
day
however
the
hands
of
the
many
had
remained
tightly
closed
upon
their
treasure
not
only
when
they
went
in
to
bow
themselves
before
the
but
also
when
they
came
out
the
lame
man
looked
at
them
as
they
passed
by
him
with
unseeing
eyes
he
wondered
what
blessing
these
men
with
their
hard
faces
and
closed
fists
had
asked
of
the
almighty
he
also
wondered
if
they
had
received
he
himself
went
but
seldom
within
the
gates
he
could
not
approach
too
near
the
holy
place
because
of
his
infirmity
god
had
declared
that
such
as
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
were
unholy
and
displeasing
in
his
sight
so
the
priests
taught
but
he
had
been
lame
from
his
birth
and
was
sadly
accustomed
to
this
and
other
miseries
of
his
lot
for
forty
years
his
soul
had
looked
from
the
windows
of
his
upon
the
world
in
these
forty
years
he
had
ceased
to
look
for
happiness
but
he
had
learned
to
be
silent
and
to
endure
which
is
perhaps
better
he
had
heard
tales
of
the
man
jesus
who
had
healed
many
once
he
had
begged
his
bearers
to
carry
him
to
the
healer
that
he
also
might
be
restored
but
they
had
refused
thou
art
able
to
earn
the
bread
which
thou
eatest
and
also
to
recompense
us
who
fetch
thee
back
and
forth
from
the
temple
gate
if
thou
art
healed
what
canst
thou
do
more
thou
art
already
old
there
is
no
profit
in
having
thee
healed
therefore
remain
as
thou
art
so
he
had
remained
as
he
was
and
now
the
man
jesus
was
dead
crucified
and
there
was
no
further
chance
that
he
might
be
healed
he
regretted
it
patiently
one
learns
to
be
patient
even
in
one
s
regrets
during
forty
years
but
he
often
thought
of
the
man
who
had
been
crucified
the
priests
had
done
it
he
had
been
told
in
secret
he
hated
the
priests
and
for
this
thing
he
hated
them
the
more
why
should
they
kill
the
man
because
he
had
healed
upon
the
sabbath
day
he
thought
bitterly
but
he
said
nothing
for
there
was
no
one
who
cared
for
his
thoughts
presently
he
bethought
himself
to
take
account
of
his
gains
for
the
day
since
the
hour
of
sunset
was
drawing
on
apace
tis
not
enough
he
muttered
as
he
counted
the
copper
coins
from
his
greasy
pouch
i
must
pay
nicolas
and
obed
else
they
will
not
fetch
me
home
i
like
not
to
stay
here
by
night
the
wind
from
the
valley
is
chill
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
two
men
ascending
the
marble
steps
they
were
not
rich
his
experienced
eye
told
him
that
but
it
was
not
from
the
rich
that
he
expected
alms
they
were
too
busy
thinking
of
the
ritual
which
they
were
going
to
repeat
or
which
perchance
they
had
just
repeated
without
a
flaw
and
the
pieces
of
money
within
their
hand
were
sure
to
be
gold
or
at
least
silver
neither
meet
for
a
beggar
no
it
was
from
women
going
humbly
in
to
their
outer
court
of
worship
or
from
children
that
he
received
or
from
such
men
as
these
in
the
plain
garb
of
galilean
peasants
therefore
the
beggar
lifted
up
his
voice
with
some
confidence
and
cried
aloud
in
the
words
which
his
mother
when
she
found
that
he
was
a
hopeless
cripple
had
taught
him
and
which
he
had
repeated
many
times
each
day
since
sons
of
abraham
chosen
of
jehovah
have
mercy
i
beseech
thee
on
one
lame
from
his
birth
give
unto
me
from
thy
bounty
so
will
god
recompense
thee
fourfold
the
two
men
stopped
and
looked
at
him
intently
and
the
beggar
repeated
his
cry
stretching
forth
his
lean
hand
imploringly
and
lifting
his
ragged
robe
to
show
the
helpless
and
shrunken
limbs
beneath
they
will
give
he
thought
within
himself
it
will
not
be
much
but
it
has
been
a
bad
day
with
me
so
far
and
every
little
helps
look
on
us
said
the
older
of
the
two
men
imperatively
the
beggar
obeyed
marvelling
within
himself
at
the
singular
brightness
of
the
man
s
eyes
he
began
to
think
that
perhaps
for
once
he
had
been
mistaken
and
that
these
men
despite
their
humble
apparel
were
after
all
rich
and
important
silver
and
gold
have
i
none
said
the
man
still
holding
the
beggar
s
expectant
gaze
with
his
powerful
eye
but
such
as
i
have
give
i
thee
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
rise
up
and
walk
a
thrill
of
hope
passed
into
the
beggar
s
starved
soul
his
heart
beat
violently
his
eyes
grew
dim
he
again
stretched
forth
his
hand
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
it
was
seized
in
a
strong
grasp
and
he
felt
himself
raised
to
his
feet
the
feet
upon
which
he
had
never
stood
in
all
the
forty
years
of
his
life
his
heart
leaped
within
his
bosom
with
a
strange
and
wonderful
joy
involuntarily
his
feet
leaped
also
he
could
not
help
it
he
clung
to
his
deliverers
weeping
out
incoherent
blessings
and
prayers
then
walking
and
leaping
he
entered
into
the
temple
with
them
and
remembering
that
he
was
no
longer
a
cripple
and
that
now
he
might
approach
god
freely
he
cried
aloud
in
his
joy
not
standing
according
to
the
law
with
feet
close
together
hands
upon
his
breast
and
head
bowed
but
walking
and
leaping
and
praising
jubilantly
with
a
loud
voice
he
knew
that
he
had
received
therefore
his
full
soul
overflowed
its
bounds
as
for
the
rest
of
the
worshippers
who
had
prayed
according
to
the
law
and
in
whose
souls
there
surged
no
such
tumultuous
happiness
and
why
indeed
should
there
they
were
greatly
disturbed
at
this
unseemly
exhibition
they
looked
askance
at
the
strange
ragged
figure
singing
aloud
of
his
wonderful
deliverance
and
they
shook
their
heads
and
frowned
go
forth
into
the
porch
commanded
certain
who
were
in
authority
until
we
shall
look
into
this
matter
and
the
beggar
nothing
loth
obeyed
still
clinging
to
his
deliverers
and
praising
more
loudly
than
ever
who
art
thou
he
cried
tell
me
for
i
would
know
mayhap
ye
be
angels
in
the
garb
of
men
nay
we
are
but
disciples
of
the
crucified
one
jesus
of
nazareth
tis
by
faith
in
his
name
that
we
have
been
able
to
heal
thee
and
not
by
our
own
power
and
when
the
beggar
heard
the
name
jesus
he
praised
god
yet
more
loudly
now
all
the
people
hearing
the
voice
of
the
beggar
ran
together
in
the
porch
which
is
called
solomon
s
to
see
what
had
happened
and
when
they
saw
him
that
had
been
lame
walking
and
leaping
as
he
praised
god
they
were
filled
with
wonder
some
ran
to
the
gate
beautiful
to
make
sure
that
it
was
he
and
no
other
but
they
found
there
only
the
empty
mat
on
which
the
beggar
had
lain
and
they
returned
marvelling
more
than
ever
behold
they
whispered
pointing
out
peter
one
to
another
it
was
the
man
yonder
who
performed
the
miracle
it
must
needs
be
that
he
is
most
holy
that
he
hath
kept
the
law
without
failure
of
jot
or
tittle
that
he
can
do
such
marvels
but
when
peter
perceived
this
he
said
unto
the
people
ye
men
of
israel
why
wonder
ye
at
this
or
why
look
ye
so
earnestly
upon
us
as
though
by
our
own
power
or
holiness
we
had
made
this
man
to
walk
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
israel
and
of
jacob
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
glorified
his
son
jesus
whom
ye
delivered
up
and
denied
in
the
presence
of
pilate
when
he
had
determined
to
release
him
ye
rejected
the
holy
and
righteous
one
and
asked
that
a
murderer
should
be
granted
you
but
the
giver
of
life
ye
killed
yet
hath
god
raised
him
again
from
the
dead
whereof
we
are
witnesses
by
faith
in
his
name
hath
this
man
been
made
whole
whom
also
ye
see
and
have
known
yea
the
faith
which
is
by
him
hath
given
him
this
perfect
soundness
in
the
presence
of
you
all
and
now
brethren
i
know
that
in
ignorance
ye
did
these
things
as
also
your
rulers
what
god
before
announced
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
that
the
christ
should
suffer
he
thus
fulfilled
repent
therefore
and
turn
ye
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
out
so
may
the
times
of
refreshing
come
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
send
the
christ
who
hath
been
before
proclaimed
unto
you
even
jesus
yet
he
must
needs
remain
in
the
heavens
till
the
time
cometh
when
all
things
shall
be
restored
which
time
hath
god
spoken
of
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began
for
moses
said
unto
the
fathers
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
like
unto
me
to
him
shall
ye
harken
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
soul
which
will
not
hear
him
shall
be
utterly
destroyed
from
among
the
yea
and
all
the
prophets
from
samuel
and
them
that
follow
after
as
many
as
have
spoken
have
likewise
foretold
of
these
days
ye
are
the
sons
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
our
fathers
saying
unto
abraham
and
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
unto
you
first
god
having
raised
up
his
son
jesus
sent
him
that
he
might
bless
you
in
turning
away
every
one
of
you
from
his
sins
and
all
the
people
paid
heed
unto
him
and
many
wept
aloud
for
joy
when
they
heard
that
they
might
be
forgiven
for
their
part
in
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
they
had
not
forgotten
that
day
nor
how
they
had
cried
away
with
him
away
with
him
crucify
him
crucify
him
nor
had
they
forgotten
the
terror
of
darkness
at
midday
and
the
earthquake
nor
the
terrible
sentence
which
they
had
pronounced
upon
themselves
his
blood
be
upon
us
and
upon
our
children
many
times
had
they
cried
in
secret
what
also
they
had
said
on
that
day
we
are
undone
we
are
undone
therefore
believed
they
with
gladness
the
word
which
peter
had
spoken
unto
them
and
they
prayed
aloud
that
god
would
forgive
them
their
but
as
peter
and
john
would
have
spoken
further
unto
them
the
priests
and
officers
of
the
temple
and
the
sadducees
came
suddenly
upon
them
what
mean
ye
blasphemers
they
said
that
within
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
temple
ye
do
preach
in
the
name
of
an
accursed
malefactor
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
these
things
shall
not
be
and
they
locked
them
up
until
the
next
day
for
it
was
now
eventide
as
for
the
beggar
that
had
been
healed
they
put
him
in
hold
also
that
they
might
examine
him
at
their
leisure
chapter
xii
in
the
council
chamber
annas
sat
quite
alone
in
the
council
chamber
of
the
sanhedrim
he
had
come
early
in
order
that
he
might
set
in
order
certain
papers
and
also
that
he
might
with
due
deliberation
determine
the
course
of
procedure
for
the
morning
s
session
but
this
was
not
easy
things
looked
dubious
for
the
success
of
his
enterprise
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
as
much
to
himself
this
miracle
now
he
thought
stroking
his
hoary
beard
reflectively
was
a
most
unfortunate
thing
most
untimely
the
multitude
seem
quite
carried
away
by
it
should
we
adopt
violent
measures
with
these
pernicious
persons
it
would
i
fear
fail
to
commend
itself
to
the
populace
at
this
point
in
his
cogitations
he
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
a
slow
heavy
step
ascending
the
stair
the
door
opened
and
caiaphas
entered
annas
looked
at
him
in
surprise
noting
with
cold
disapproval
his
haggard
face
his
disordered
apparel
his
shaking
hands
i
am
astonished
he
said
bringing
his
critical
gaze
to
a
standstill
upon
the
uneasy
eyes
of
his
astonished
indeed
i
may
say
that
i
am
not
well
pleased
to
see
thee
here
this
morning
my
son
thou
hast
the
look
of
a
man
who
should
be
within
the
walls
of
his
sick
chamber
the
ministrations
of
my
daughter
s
skilful
hand
will
surely
prove
more
acceptable
to
thee
in
thy
present
state
than
the
deliberations
of
statecraft
i
pray
thee
let
me
command
for
thee
a
litter
hold
said
caiaphas
grasping
the
old
man
by
the
arm
hear
what
i
have
to
say
to
thee
first
and
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
husky
whisper
thy
daughter
is
no
longer
my
wife
what
dost
thou
mean
man
thou
art
mad
nay
i
am
not
mad
would
that
i
were
said
the
other
faintly
i
repeat
that
thou
art
mad
cried
annas
his
eyes
blazing
with
a
scornful
fire
what
my
daughter
repudiated
by
she
hath
become
a
follower
of
the
nazarene
said
caiaphas
dully
could
she
longer
be
wife
of
mine
where
is
she
she
hath
gone
to
them
annas
was
silent
for
a
time
if
what
thou
sayest
be
no
figment
of
a
disordered
brain
he
said
deliberately
then
i
say
thou
hast
done
well
no
longer
wife
of
thine
she
shall
be
no
longer
daughter
of
mine
she
is
henceforth
one
of
the
followers
of
him
whom
we
hanged
upon
the
accursed
tree
as
for
them
shall
i
tell
thee
what
shall
shortly
come
to
pass
the
younger
man
made
no
reply
when
men
would
plant
grain
in
a
field
which
hath
been
a
wilderness
continued
annas
still
in
the
same
icy
deliberate
tones
they
root
up
the
tares
and
utterly
destroy
them
with
fire
this
shall
we
do
with
these
mischievous
and
deadly
weeds
that
be
winding
their
poisonous
roots
about
the
only
props
that
remain
to
our
suffering
nation
the
temple
and
the
home
but
let
not
this
thing
be
spoken
of
the
matter
of
the
woman
i
mean
there
is
no
need
to
make
our
name
a
byword
and
a
hissing
she
hath
for
the
present
gone
to
pay
a
visit
later
we
shall
perhaps
devise
a
way
to
secretly
rid
ourselves
what
cried
caiaphas
starting
up
wouldst
thou
hist
man
the
others
are
coming
wilt
thou
remain
we
shall
this
morning
concern
ourselves
with
this
very
matter
i
will
remain
and
when
presently
the
council
was
convened
he
took
his
old
place
upon
the
right
hand
of
annas
in
his
sick
heart
he
wished
for
death
yet
there
burned
within
him
the
miserable
desire
to
avenge
himself
upon
them
at
whose
door
he
laid
the
loss
of
both
his
wife
and
his
son
thou
mayest
fetch
hither
the
two
men
whom
ye
put
in
hold
commanded
annas
likewise
the
beggar
ye
behold
in
these
he
continued
fixing
his
piercing
gaze
upon
peter
and
john
as
they
stood
before
the
semicircle
of
their
august
judges
two
men
who
were
prominent
followers
of
the
nazarene
who
was
recently
put
to
death
because
of
his
crimes
against
church
and
state
wise
men
would
have
taken
a
wholesome
warning
from
the
fate
of
their
false
teacher
but
these
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
him
who
was
crucified
not
remembering
apparently
that
those
footsteps
led
to
the
cross
yesterday
there
was
a
tumult
raised
in
the
holy
temple
a
beggar
whom
god
had
justly
afflicted
because
of
the
sins
of
his
fathers
was
forsooth
healed
healed
by
these
men
it
is
not
meet
that
such
things
be
permitted
i
therefore
command
that
ye
tell
us
straightway
by
what
means
and
by
what
name
ye
have
done
this
thing
ye
rulers
of
the
people
and
elders
of
israel
said
peter
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
beggar
who
had
involuntarily
shrunken
back
abashed
stood
boldly
forth
if
we
this
day
be
examined
of
the
good
deed
done
to
the
impotent
man
and
if
ye
will
inquire
by
what
means
he
is
made
whole
be
it
known
unto
you
all
and
to
all
the
people
of
israel
that
by
the
name
of
jesus
the
nazarene
the
messiah
whom
ye
crucified
but
whom
god
raised
from
the
dead
even
by
him
doth
this
man
stand
here
before
you
whole
this
is
the
stone
which
was
set
at
naught
of
you
builders
which
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
neither
is
there
salvation
in
any
other
for
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
saved
something
of
the
same
feeling
which
had
overwhelmed
annas
on
the
night
when
he
had
essayed
to
question
the
man
of
nazareth
came
upon
him
he
tried
to
speak
and
his
voice
failed
him
meantime
a
murmur
of
surprise
ran
about
the
circle
how
is
it
whispered
one
to
his
neighbor
that
these
ignorant
men
can
speak
in
such
a
manner
they
have
learned
it
in
the
company
of
the
galilean
replied
the
other
dost
thou
not
remember
his
sayings
what
shall
we
say
queried
a
third
the
man
there
will
spread
the
thing
far
and
wide
remove
the
prisoners
commanded
annas
somewhat
recovering
himself
we
must
confer
in
private
concerning
this
thing
this
is
a
most
untoward
happening
he
added
when
they
were
alone
looking
about
him
at
the
circle
of
attentive
faces
what
now
shall
we
do
with
these
men
let
them
be
stoned
for
blasphemy
said
alexander
drawing
his
heavy
brows
together
did
they
not
call
the
crucified
galilean
the
messiah
and
declare
that
god
had
raised
him
from
the
dead
this
also
they
preach
openly
to
the
people
for
myself
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
our
case
is
worse
than
before
the
galilean
himself
was
but
one
man
and
could
be
in
but
one
place
now
forsooth
we
have
a
thousand
men
in
his
stead
all
haranguing
healing
and
creating
a
very
fire
of
heresy
amongst
the
populace
the
thing
must
be
stopped
else
will
our
power
be
these
men
be
worse
than
the
romans
for
they
at
least
suffer
us
to
be
in
peace
suppose
that
we
stone
them
remarked
one
of
the
sons
of
annas
with
a
sneer
how
then
are
we
bettered
the
whole
city
would
take
up
the
cry
against
us
more
especially
the
lower
classes
who
envy
us
our
wealth
these
holy
men
have
wrought
a
notable
miracle
they
would
howl
and
the
sanhedrists
have
stoned
them
for
could
we
crush
the
whole
mob
of
the
disciples
with
a
single
stone
and
perform
the
deed
quietly
then
should
i
cry
with
a
good
will
let
them
be
as
it
is
such
a
course
would
only
add
fuel
to
the
flame
thou
hast
spoken
wisely
my
son
said
annas
the
miracle
is
a
notable
one
all
jerusalem
knows
it
and
we
can
not
deny
it
but
that
it
spread
no
further
among
the
people
let
us
straitly
threaten
them
that
they
speak
henceforth
to
no
man
in
this
name
fetch
now
the
men
he
added
turning
to
the
temple
police
who
waited
their
pleasure
we
have
considered
the
matter
of
your
doings
with
care
he
continued
with
portentous
solemnity
when
the
prisoners
had
again
been
set
in
his
presence
the
matter
of
the
healing
we
are
disposed
to
overlook
though
it
is
not
seemly
for
children
of
dust
to
assume
the
prerogatives
of
the
almighty
by
his
hand
hath
this
man
been
laid
low
he
should
have
remained
as
he
was
it
is
not
our
custom
to
heal
beggars
nor
should
it
be
yours
it
savoreth
of
a
compact
with
the
evil
one
the
matter
of
your
speaking
to
the
people
is
far
more
serious
dost
thou
know
that
thou
hast
laid
thyself
open
to
a
death
by
stoning
for
verily
thou
hast
blasphemed
foully
our
ears
and
the
ears
of
them
that
have
heard
thee
are
polluted
by
the
unholy
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
yet
are
we
merciful
and
inclined
to
pardon
even
this
iniquity
on
the
one
condition
that
from
henceforth
ye
speak
to
no
man
in
this
name
of
jesus
a
name
i
like
not
to
utter
if
now
ye
are
ready
to
comply
with
this
our
reasonable
request
ye
shall
at
once
be
released
then
did
john
the
beloved
disciple
fix
his
calm
eyes
on
the
man
who
had
spoken
with
something
of
the
divine
prescience
of
the
master
did
he
read
the
false
soul
behind
the
lying
lips
whether
it
be
right
in
the
sight
of
god
he
said
solemnly
to
obey
you
rather
than
god
judge
ye
for
we
can
not
but
speak
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
continue
to
speak
them
cried
caiaphas
in
a
fury
as
he
thought
of
his
lost
wife
and
a
fate
more
terrible
than
stoning
shall
befall
thee
shall
we
endure
to
see
but
annas
laid
a
warning
hand
upon
his
arm
remove
these
men
he
said
hastily
to
the
temple
guard
let
them
go
and
the
beggar
my
lord
release
him
also
but
bid
him
hold
his
peace
concerning
his
healing
both
in
the
temple
and
elsewhere
lest
a
worse
thing
than
lameness
come
upon
him
but
the
beggar
followed
after
the
disciples
as
they
went
away
and
when
they
saw
him
they
said
dost
thou
join
thyself
to
us
because
thou
believest
on
the
name
of
jesus
and
he
answered
them
humbly
by
the
name
of
jesus
was
i
healed
of
mine
infirmity
how
then
can
i
help
but
believe
and
they
suffered
him
gladly
because
of
that
word
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
place
wherein
were
gathered
many
others
that
believed
they
told
all
that
the
chief
priests
and
elders
had
said
to
them
and
they
lifted
up
their
voice
to
god
in
one
accord
and
said
o
lord
thou
that
didst
make
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
that
in
them
is
by
the
mouth
of
david
thy
servant
thou
didst
say
why
did
the
nations
rage
and
the
people
meditate
vain
things
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
in
array
and
the
rulers
were
gathered
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
for
of
a
truth
in
this
city
were
gathered
together
against
thy
holy
servant
jesus
whom
thou
didst
anoint
both
herod
and
pontius
pilate
with
the
nations
and
the
peoples
of
israel
and
they
did
what
thy
hand
and
thy
counsel
had
determined
should
come
to
pass
and
now
lord
look
upon
their
threatenings
and
grant
unto
thy
servants
to
speak
thy
word
with
all
boldness
and
stretch
forth
thy
hand
to
heal
that
signs
and
wonders
may
be
done
by
the
name
of
thy
holy
servant
jesus
and
when
they
had
thus
prayed
behold
the
place
where
they
were
assembled
was
shaken
and
they
were
all
filled
with
the
spirit
so
that
they
had
no
fear
in
their
hearts
of
what
might
befall
them
at
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
on
that
day
and
every
day
they
continued
to
speak
the
words
which
god
gave
them
with
great
joy
and
confidence
chapter
xiii
at
the
feet
of
the
apostles
to
anna
in
the
house
of
mary
there
had
come
peace
when
she
had
awakened
from
the
swoon
in
which
she
had
sunken
at
the
feet
of
caiaphas
to
find
herself
alone
she
scarce
knew
at
first
what
had
befallen
her
but
memory
too
faithful
repeated
to
her
shrinking
soul
the
words
which
had
struck
at
the
very
fountain
of
life
she
turned
them
over
dully
in
her
mind
as
i
would
cut
off
my
right
hand
should
it
become
polluted
beyond
cleansing
so
also
will
i
sever
thee
from
my
life
how
can
that
be
she
thought
staring
at
the
light
branches
of
a
rose
tree
that
swayed
from
the
trellis
above
her
head
the
sun
struck
vivid
sparks
of
emerald
fire
from
its
translucent
leaves
the
breeze
shook
a
blossom
and
a
handful
of
the
odorous
petals
fell
upon
her
face
she
inhaled
their
fragrance
as
in
a
dream
of
pain
so
i
will
sever
thee
from
my
life
she
repeated
looking
at
the
shattered
rose
ah
it
can
never
bloom
again
and
with
the
thought
came
a
sudden
frightful
realization
of
what
had
happened
she
sprang
up
and
looked
wildly
about
her
i
must
find
him
it
can
not
can
not
be
then
she
sank
feebly
upon
her
knees
beside
the
bench
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
is
it
for
naught
that
misery
instinctively
assumes
this
attitude
nay
rather
it
is
a
divine
impulse
of
the
suffering
soul
a
blind
and
voiceless
feeling
after
a
hand
in
the
darkness
and
the
hand
is
always
there
to
anna
thus
bowed
there
came
at
length
the
thought
of
god
of
jesus
the
of
stephen
his
dark
eyes
full
of
loving
light
of
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
like
herself
desolate
and
presently
though
she
scarce
knew
why
she
grew
quite
calm
and
strong
she
arose
i
will
go
she
said
aloud
to
them
they
will
tell
me
what
i
must
do
and
so
it
was
that
she
came
to
the
house
of
john
the
beloved
disciple
where
abode
mary
whom
the
dying
lord
had
given
into
his
keeping
and
with
them
peter
and
andrew
his
brother
also
stephen
i
am
desolate
she
said
humbly
for
my
husband
hath
cast
me
off
because
i
believe
that
the
crucified
jesus
is
the
messiah
of
israel
then
art
thou
welcome
here
said
the
master
of
the
house
gravely
but
mary
fell
on
her
neck
and
kissed
her
and
she
wept
with
her
because
she
knew
that
tears
are
healing
if
only
they
be
wiped
away
by
the
hand
of
god
and
so
after
many
days
there
came
to
her
peace
nay
more
there
came
joy
involuntarily
songs
broke
from
her
lips
lips
for
many
years
silent
she
smiled
often
even
when
alone
for
a
strange
delight
filled
her
soul
her
deep
eyes
shone
like
stars
stephen
saw
the
change
in
her
and
he
rejoiced
the
lord
is
with
thee
mother
of
my
titus
he
said
tenderly
i
scarce
know
why
i
am
so
happy
she
replied
is
it
meet
that
i
should
rejoice
when
my
son
is
dead
and
when
i
am
more
desolate
than
a
widow
it
is
the
gift
of
him
who
sitteth
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
said
stephen
did
he
not
say
peace
i
leave
with
you
my
peace
i
give
unto
you
not
as
the
world
giveth
give
i
unto
you
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
neither
let
it
be
and
this
good
word
of
peace
he
left
with
his
chosen
ones
on
the
very
night
before
his
death
the
world
can
not
give
peace
in
the
midst
of
sorrow
but
he
can
and
he
hath
given
it
unto
thee
beloved
and
thou
dost
rejoice
and
thy
joy
shall
no
one
take
from
thee
but
my
husband
said
anna
eagerly
ask
the
lord
that
it
may
be
granted
unto
him
to
see
the
truth
i
will
also
ask
then
shall
it
be
done
for
us
according
to
his
promise
which
can
not
fail
and
he
will
again
love
me
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
said
stephen
smiling
he
will
again
love
thee
and
the
love
that
he
hath
had
is
as
nothing
to
that
god
will
give
him
for
god
is
love
and
he
is
also
the
all
love
is
from
god
and
without
it
would
the
world
fall
from
its
place
in
the
heavens
into
the
darkness
which
is
outside
of
love
if
indeed
there
be
any
place
where
the
light
of
god
doth
not
penetrate
he
paused
and
looked
thoughtfully
away
into
the
sunset
as
if
he
would
pierce
with
his
longing
gaze
beyond
the
gold
and
the
crimson
to
that
place
where
dwelt
the
risen
lord
the
days
went
swiftly
in
this
new
life
for
none
were
idle
indeed
there
was
never
a
company
of
folk
since
the
world
began
into
whose
lives
crowded
more
of
service
of
love
of
joy
the
sick
the
unhappy
the
poor
from
all
the
city
and
the
country
round
about
came
for
healing
cheering
help
nor
was
any
turned
away
the
disciples
were
ever
mindful
of
the
word
of
their
lord
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
they
remembered
also
with
awe
how
he
had
washed
their
feet
on
that
last
night
before
he
was
betrayed
so
there
was
no
service
too
lowly
no
labor
too
arduous
for
them
to
undertake
in
the
strength
of
their
new
joy
did
he
not
say
unto
us
said
peter
his
face
glowing
with
divine
enthusiasm
as
the
father
hath
sent
me
into
the
world
even
so
send
i
you
to
be
a
christian
in
these
days
meant
simply
to
live
as
christ
had
lived
and
so
the
women
were
busy
from
dawn
until
evening
in
fashioning
garments
for
them
that
had
none
in
preparing
the
simple
food
which
they
ate
from
house
to
house
with
gladness
and
singleness
of
heart
every
meal
a
memorial
feast
of
him
who
had
gone
to
prepare
a
place
for
them
in
the
heavens
and
the
men
in
proclaiming
the
amazing
tidings
of
salvation
from
sin
in
a
world
given
over
to
sin
of
joy
in
a
world
wherein
was
weeping
and
pain
and
woe
of
peace
in
the
midst
of
strife
of
a
great
light
that
had
shined
in
the
darkness
it
was
so
real
so
wonderful
so
new
they
had
not
read
of
these
things
in
an
ancient
book
they
had
not
heard
them
with
cold
dead
ears
as
a
tale
that
is
told
but
they
had
seen
the
lord
living
and
walking
among
them
they
had
seen
him
upon
the
cross
they
had
seen
him
in
the
tomb
dead
his
hands
and
feet
torn
with
the
cruel
nails
and
they
had
also
seen
him
alive
again
and
received
into
the
glories
of
a
visible
heaven
upon
their
heads
had
the
pentecostal
flames
rested
and
they
beheld
their
mortal
bodies
endowed
with
divine
powers
little
wonder
then
that
they
rejoiced
little
wonder
that
a
holy
fear
came
upon
every
soul
and
that
they
had
favor
with
all
the
people
yet
for
our
comfort
is
it
written
that
the
lord
once
said
unto
thomas
because
thou
hast
seen
me
thou
hast
believed
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
now
because
very
many
that
were
poor
came
to
the
disciples
to
be
fed
and
because
the
apostles
had
now
no
time
for
fishing
being
made
fishers
of
men
as
the
lord
had
promised
and
for
the
reason
that
then
as
now
no
one
can
live
in
the
world
without
money
they
asked
of
the
lord
concerning
this
thing
as
indeed
they
still
asked
about
all
things
just
as
when
he
was
on
the
earth
and
it
became
very
clear
to
them
what
they
must
do
and
they
did
it
in
all
simplicity
and
singleness
of
heart
they
that
had
lands
or
houses
sold
them
and
brought
the
price
of
the
things
that
were
sold
and
laid
them
down
at
the
apostles
feet
and
distribution
was
made
unto
every
man
according
as
he
had
need
so
that
there
should
no
longer
be
among
them
any
that
was
rich
for
had
not
the
lord
said
to
the
young
ruler
go
sell
what
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
also
how
hardly
shall
they
that
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
and
because
they
thought
much
about
heaven
in
those
days
and
because
they
longed
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
it
was
not
hard
for
some
of
the
rich
to
do
this
their
possessions
were
as
nothing
to
them
compared
with
the
riches
which
god
was
giving
so
freely
he
is
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
and
alas
humanity
is
the
same
yesterday
and
but
thank
god
for
the
which
shall
also
be
forever
when
we
shall
be
like
him
there
was
in
jerusalem
a
certain
man
named
ananias
and
he
was
married
to
a
woman
called
sapphira
they
had
heard
the
preaching
of
peter
and
they
believed
and
came
and
joined
themselves
to
the
church
they
were
rich
people
and
owned
land
outside
the
city
now
when
others
who
had
possessions
sold
them
and
brought
the
money
to
lay
at
the
apostles
feet
they
were
ill
pleased
why
should
this
be
said
ananias
to
his
wife
if
we
give
a
tithe
of
what
is
ours
is
not
that
all
that
the
law
demands
it
is
unjust
declared
sapphira
we
also
shall
be
beggars
if
we
do
this
thing
besides
it
hath
been
told
me
that
the
scribes
and
elders
have
the
intent
to
crush
these
apostles
as
well
as
all
that
believe
for
myself
i
have
no
mind
to
be
stoned
let
us
withdraw
then
nay
not
so
for
god
is
with
these
men
as
also
thou
hast
seen
said
sapphira
and
if
the
master
presently
come
back
from
heaven
as
indeed
they
all
expect
he
will
establish
a
kingdom
here
in
jerusalem
and
it
must
not
chance
that
we
be
found
on
the
wrong
side
when
that
shall
come
to
pass
they
do
not
demand
that
we
sell
our
lands
said
ananias
knitting
his
brows
thoughtfully
let
us
be
prudent
and
reserve
our
possessions
till
we
shall
see
what
is
going
to
befall
only
this
morning
joses
brought
money
and
laid
it
down
at
the
apostles
feet
said
sapphira
he
hath
sold
every
cubit
of
his
farm
in
the
hill
country
they
know
that
we
also
have
lands
she
added
fretfully
and
they
expect
that
we
will
do
the
same
there
are
already
five
thousand
persons
in
the
church
and
very
few
among
them
own
earth
enough
to
be
buried
in
it
is
a
hard
case
whined
ananias
if
honest
industrious
folk
must
give
up
all
that
they
have
to
beggars
they
will
devour
it
up
like
grasshoppers
as
for
us
who
have
given
it
what
shall
we
have
for
a
time
of
adversity
or
for
our
old
age
what
indeed
echoed
his
wife
but
we
must
do
something
or
we
shall
be
talked
about
what
if
and
she
lowered
her
voice
to
a
whisper
we
sell
the
land
and
also
freely
tell
of
the
matter
but
of
the
price
that
is
received
we
will
give
a
part
only
the
remainder
we
will
bestow
in
safety
till
we
shall
ourselves
have
need
of
it
thou
art
a
prudent
woman
cried
her
husband
i
know
a
man
who
will
give
me
a
good
price
for
the
land
go
then
and
sell
but
let
no
one
know
of
the
amount
which
thou
receivest
that
shall
be
secret
betwixt
the
two
of
us
the
man
peter
shall
suppose
that
we
have
given
all
even
as
did
joses
so
ananias
went
and
sold
the
land
and
he
received
for
it
a
goodly
sum
which
the
two
took
secretly
and
buried
in
the
earth
keeping
out
a
part
only
this
the
woman
laid
in
her
lap
it
is
a
great
sum
she
said
looking
regretfully
at
the
pieces
of
silver
with
it
we
might
buy
fine
raiment
for
ourselves
or
i
might
put
them
upon
a
string
for
my
neck
i
have
no
necklace
spoken
like
a
woman
and
therefore
foolishly
said
ananias
lifting
a
handful
of
the
coins
and
letting
them
slip
through
his
fingers
one
by
one
for
my
part
i
should
buy
a
vineyard
one
could
then
have
an
abundance
of
wine
neither
of
these
things
can
be
said
sapphira
with
a
sigh
we
must
give
it
else
when
the
messiah
shall
come
the
man
peter
will
say
these
people
having
land
sold
it
but
gave
no
part
to
us
then
the
messiah
will
give
us
neither
place
nor
power
suppose
he
comes
not
said
the
man
doggedly
we
shall
at
least
stand
well
with
the
apostles
and
the
rest
they
be
all
prating
of
the
generosity
of
joses
such
a
man
so
holy
they
cry
they
shall
speak
of
us
also
what
we
shall
give
will
be
much
more
than
his
paltry
bit
of
silver
and
the
woman
tossed
her
head
well
i
will
give
it
but
do
not
let
them
know
about
the
other
whispered
sapphira
thou
mayest
trust
me
for
that
said
the
man
with
a
harsh
laugh
on
the
morrow
when
all
were
gathered
together
according
to
their
custom
came
ananias
bringing
the
money
sapphira
remaining
at
home
to
guard
the
buried
treasure
and
he
laid
down
the
silver
at
the
feet
of
peter
saying
i
have
sold
my
lands
for
the
service
of
the
lord
and
here
is
all
the
price
of
them
and
the
people
looked
at
the
money
which
he
had
laid
down
and
they
marvelled
at
his
generosity
saying
one
to
another
joses
truly
was
righteous
but
this
man
hath
brought
a
greater
sum
than
he
but
peter
fixed
his
inspired
eyes
upon
the
giver
he
read
his
soul
and
he
said
to
him
ananias
why
hath
satan
filled
thine
heart
to
lie
to
the
holy
spirit
and
keep
back
part
of
the
price
of
the
land
whilst
it
remained
was
it
not
thine
own
and
after
it
was
sold
was
it
not
in
thine
own
power
why
hast
thou
conceived
this
thing
in
thine
heart
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men
but
unto
god
and
when
ananias
heard
these
words
it
was
as
though
the
light
of
god
had
been
flashed
into
his
soul
a
fierce
agony
fell
upon
him
he
saw
clearly
what
he
was
and
what
god
was
and
because
this
may
not
be
endured
by
a
mortal
he
fell
down
at
the
feet
of
the
apostle
dead
he
had
passed
into
the
presence
of
that
love
which
is
also
a
consuming
fire
and
the
young
men
arose
wound
up
his
body
in
grave
clothes
and
carried
it
away
and
it
was
about
the
space
of
three
hours
after
when
his
wife
not
knowing
what
was
done
came
in
and
peter
said
to
her
tell
me
whether
ye
sold
the
land
for
fifty
shekels
and
she
said
yes
for
fifty
shekels
then
peter
said
unto
her
how
is
it
that
ye
have
agreed
together
to
tempt
the
spirit
of
the
lord
behold
the
feet
of
them
which
buried
thy
husband
are
at
the
door
and
shall
carry
thee
out
then
fell
she
down
straightway
at
his
feet
and
expired
and
the
young
men
came
in
and
found
her
dead
and
carrying
her
forth
buried
her
by
her
husband
and
great
fear
came
upon
all
the
church
and
upon
as
many
as
heard
these
things
chapter
xiv
a
cup
of
cold
water
then
the
beast
is
not
thine
own
i
have
said
that
it
belongs
to
abu
ben
hesed
who
dwells
in
the
wilderness
of
shur
for
this
journey
alone
was
it
ours
i
must
return
it
to
its
owner
after
that
i
have
accomplished
mine
errand
in
yonder
city
the
man
looked
at
the
boy
steadily
for
a
full
minute
a
slight
smile
curled
the
corners
of
his
lips
but
he
turned
his
head
so
that
the
lad
should
not
see
it
and
thy
business
in
jerusalem
what
might
it
be
thou
art
perhaps
a
merchant
seeking
goodly
pearls
or
a
purchaser
of
slaves
or
perhaps
a
pilgrim
my
business
is
naught
to
thee
i
have
asked
of
thee
a
question
wilt
thou
care
for
the
beast
till
i
shall
return
i
will
pay
thee
for
it
the
man
ran
his
eyes
once
more
over
the
white
dromedary
she
shook
herself
and
all
the
silver
bells
of
the
bridle
rang
merrily
i
will
take
care
of
her
he
said
nodding
his
head
once
or
twice
and
smiling
again
broadly
and
when
wilt
thou
be
pleased
to
return
this
very
day
at
evening
if
i
shall
find
the
man
i
would
see
his
name
is
jesus
canst
thou
tell
me
where
to
find
him
there
be
half
a
score
of
that
name
in
the
city
dost
thou
mean
jesus
barabbas
and
the
man
laughed
aloud
as
if
his
thoughts
afforded
him
secret
pleasure
is
he
a
magician
asked
the
lad
eagerly
a
magician
dost
thou
mean
a
man
whom
the
gods
granted
to
be
born
under
a
lucky
star
assuredly
then
he
is
the
man
what
is
thy
name
broke
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
my
name
said
the
man
looking
startled
oh
tis
thou
maiden
my
name
is
gestas
my
pretty
one
why
dost
thou
ask
that
we
may
find
thee
when
we
shall
return
from
the
city
can
this
jesus
barabbas
of
whom
thou
hast
spoken
heal
blindness
art
thou
blind
yes
i
am
blind
i
would
be
healed
and
i
have
heard
that
a
man
named
jesus
can
heal
blindness
the
man
looked
soberly
for
a
moment
at
her
blank
eyes
he
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak
then
scratching
his
shaggy
head
reflectively
he
again
glanced
at
the
white
dromedary
go
into
the
city
he
said
at
length
and
ask
for
the
man
some
one
will
tell
thee
i
will
care
for
the
beast
whilst
thou
art
gone
come
anat
let
us
make
haste
cried
the
lad
joyfully
we
must
find
him
at
once
so
the
two
went
away
towards
jerusalem
which
lay
not
far
distant
its
walls
and
towers
gleaming
as
whitely
as
though
no
lurid
shadow
of
destruction
hung
from
the
avenging
heavens
above
it
as
for
the
man
whose
name
was
gestas
he
laughed
aloud
as
he
seized
the
stately
mirah
by
the
bridle
truly
the
gods
love
me
he
said
this
beast
will
bring
a
goodly
sum
and
he
struck
the
white
dromedary
across
the
face
with
his
staff
in
order
to
let
her
know
that
she
had
a
new
master
yonder
is
a
venerable
man
said
seth
to
the
blind
girl
when
the
two
had
entered
within
the
gate
and
he
ran
forward
and
plucked
the
man
by
the
sleeve
canst
thou
tell
me
where
to
find
the
man
jesus
who
can
heal
blindness
the
old
man
turned
upon
the
lad
with
blazing
eyes
beggar
he
cried
get
thee
gone
how
dost
thou
dare
pollute
mine
ears
with
that
name
seth
stared
at
him
in
amaze
as
he
strode
onward
muttering
angrily
to
himself
his
snowy
beard
blowing
over
his
shoulder
in
the
light
breeze
by
the
sacred
nile
he
exclaimed
in
what
have
i
offended
praise
be
to
the
gods
they
have
no
such
customs
in
memphis
well
i
must
even
ask
another
taking
the
blind
girl
once
more
by
the
hand
they
walked
a
little
further
on
it
was
as
yet
early
in
the
day
but
the
streets
were
alive
with
people
hurrying
to
and
fro
merchants
sitting
comfortably
at
their
stalls
cried
lustily
to
the
to
come
buy
of
their
goods
beggars
whined
out
their
piteous
tales
of
woe
and
displayed
their
gruesome
deformities
to
the
averted
eyes
of
the
hurrying
crowd
clinked
their
brazen
cups
and
bawled
loudly
of
the
cooling
draughts
which
they
carried
in
the
upon
their
backs
once
the
two
adventurers
had
to
squeeze
themselves
back
into
an
angle
of
the
wall
while
a
platoon
of
roman
soldiers
marched
by
the
sun
glittering
in
dazzling
splendor
on
their
burnished
shields
seth
s
heart
had
suddenly
grown
heavy
within
him
though
he
could
scarce
have
told
the
reason
he
almost
feared
to
ask
the
question
which
hovered
upon
his
lips
of
any
of
these
busy
people
presently
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
blind
man
feeling
his
way
slowly
along
with
a
staff
and
whining
out
a
dolorous
cry
for
alms
as
he
went
his
heart
sank
lower
still
if
there
is
a
great
magician
who
can
heal
blindness
in
this
place
he
thought
why
is
not
this
man
seeking
him
darting
forward
he
touched
him
upon
the
sleeve
canst
thou
tell
me
he
said
timidly
if
there
is
a
man
called
jesus
anywhere
about
a
man
who
can
heal
blindness
the
beggar
stopped
short
and
turned
his
head
there
was
such
a
man
he
said
but
he
is
dead
crucified
three
months
since
i
never
found
him
he
added
bitterly
i
came
too
late
then
he
went
on
his
way
and
the
boy
heard
his
shrill
voice
rising
and
falling
dismally
adown
the
street
he
stood
still
in
the
place
where
he
was
staring
stupidly
after
the
man
the
words
too
late
still
echoing
in
his
ears
curses
upon
thy
stupid
head
why
dost
thou
block
the
roadway
and
a
smart
blow
across
his
cheek
from
the
whip
of
a
muleteer
served
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
a
cry
from
anat
looking
quickly
around
he
saw
her
fall
to
the
ground
beneath
the
hoofs
of
the
laden
ass
which
the
man
was
driving
with
a
shrill
cry
of
fear
the
lad
sprang
forward
and
dragged
the
girl
out
from
among
the
confused
tangle
of
men
and
animals
the
muleteer
shrieking
curses
upon
him
the
other
merely
pausing
an
instant
to
stare
curiously
at
the
scene
no
one
offered
to
help
him
and
cold
with
fear
he
lifted
the
slender
form
in
his
arms
there
was
a
projecting
arch
near
by
with
a
great
doorway
sunken
deep
into
the
wall
of
masonry
in
the
shelter
of
this
he
laid
his
burden
down
and
looked
into
the
beloved
face
in
a
very
agony
of
terror
anat
anat
he
cried
bending
over
her
but
there
was
no
answer
the
bloom
of
the
brown
cheeks
had
changed
to
a
curious
dusky
pallor
the
fringed
lids
had
fallen
over
the
sightless
eyes
the
slender
hands
were
cold
anat
anat
he
repeated
in
a
frenzy
awake
and
he
shook
her
by
the
arm
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
my
god
if
she
is
dead
just
then
with
a
harsh
sound
of
rusty
hinges
the
great
door
behind
them
swung
open
and
a
turbaned
head
peered
cautiously
out
the
lad
started
to
his
feet
with
sudden
hope
kind
sir
he
said
beseechingly
my
sister
hath
been
grievously
hurt
nay
i
know
not
if
she
be
alive
wilt
thou
give
me
a
cup
of
water
that
i
may
try
and
bring
back
her
soul
the
man
looked
at
him
coldly
this
is
the
house
of
god
he
said
tis
not
meet
that
its
threshold
be
defiled
with
that
which
is
dead
tis
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
jehovah
get
thee
hence
the
hour
for
prayer
draweth
nigh
nay
but
i
beseech
thee
by
the
love
of
isis
give
me
but
a
cup
a
small
cup
of
water
get
thee
hence
said
the
man
with
a
gesture
of
abhorrence
there
is
naught
here
for
such
as
thou
and
he
made
as
though
he
would
have
pushed
the
senseless
form
of
the
blind
girl
into
the
street
with
his
foot
seth
s
eyes
blazed
the
curses
of
sechet
light
upon
thee
he
cried
fiercely
thou
hast
the
withered
heart
of
a
mummy
a
thousand
years
dead
then
he
caught
up
his
burden
once
more
and
fled
away
the
furious
imprecations
of
the
jew
sounding
in
his
ears
hurrying
blindly
forward
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
whither
he
was
going
but
he
became
conscious
after
a
few
moments
that
he
had
come
into
a
quieter
place
with
a
dim
sense
of
relief
he
once
more
laid
the
limp
figure
down
upon
the
pavement
this
time
to
his
great
joy
he
heard
a
faint
sound
she
was
trying
to
speak
he
kneeled
at
her
side
and
lifted
her
head
to
his
knees
water
water
she
moaned
feebly
he
looked
distractedly
about
him
the
long
narrow
street
was
suffocatingly
hot
on
either
side
of
it
stretched
blank
walls
of
masonry
pierced
occasionally
with
a
door
two
or
three
dogs
skulked
in
the
black
shadow
of
an
archway
near
by
and
a
flock
of
swallows
swooped
back
and
forth
in
the
dazzling
sunshine
crying
out
to
each
other
with
wild
sweetness
but
there
was
no
human
being
in
sight
he
could
hear
the
distant
cries
of
the
venders
and
the
shouts
of
the
muleteers
from
the
busy
street
which
he
had
just
left
it
seemed
to
him
presently
as
he
listened
that
somewhere
near
by
he
could
hear
the
cool
tinkle
of
a
fountain
he
looked
up
from
the
top
of
the
wall
above
his
head
there
fluttered
a
glimmer
of
green
leaves
there
must
be
there
was
a
garden
there
and
water
he
was
sure
of
it
he
sprang
up
and
laying
anat
s
head
carefully
down
pulled
impatiently
at
the
bell
which
hung
at
the
side
of
one
of
the
sunken
doorways
after
a
long
delay
every
minute
of
which
seemed
a
separate
eternity
to
the
boy
a
panel
in
the
door
swung
open
and
the
head
of
a
man
was
thrust
out
what
wilt
thou
he
said
in
a
surly
tone
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
boy
water
for
the
love
of
all
the
gods
water
my
what
dost
thou
mean
fellow
interrupted
the
man
scowling
by
coming
to
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
for
water
the
public
fountains
are
for
such
as
thou
and
without
further
ado
he
shut
the
door
with
a
decisive
clap
seth
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
stunned
then
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
hot
stones
with
a
smothered
cry
of
despair
and
bowed
his
head
upon
his
knees
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
a
touch
upon
his
shoulder
aroused
him
he
looked
up
dully
his
eyes
red
with
weeping
what
aileth
thee
lad
he
stared
at
the
face
of
his
questioner
without
answering
it
was
like
no
other
face
he
had
ever
seen
and
yet
strangely
enough
something
in
the
dark
eyes
brought
back
to
him
the
dim
memory
of
his
mother
the
young
man
for
it
was
a
young
man
who
had
spoken
repeated
his
question
and
this
time
the
lad
answered
my
sister
hath
been
trampled
upon
by
a
beast
of
burden
she
is
dying
for
water
no
one
will
help
me
my
bottle
is
empty
and
i
know
not
where
to
find
a
fountain
but
the
stranger
did
not
wait
to
hear
all
he
was
already
sprinkling
the
face
of
the
girl
who
had
again
lapsed
into
unconsciousness
she
is
not
much
hurt
he
said
at
length
see
she
is
reviving
already
and
indeed
under
his
skilful
ministrations
the
color
had
begun
to
return
to
the
cheeks
and
lips
of
the
injured
girl
but
she
is
blind
said
seth
looking
up
wistfully
into
the
face
of
the
young
man
and
we
have
come
from
egypt
seeking
for
the
man
jesus
who
can
heal
such
a
beggar
told
me
that
he
was
dead
but
it
is
not
true
the
face
of
the
stranger
glowed
with
a
smile
so
angelic
that
the
lad
involuntarily
cried
out
with
wonder
nay
he
cried
he
is
not
dead
he
liveth
forever
more
at
the
right
hand
of
god
then
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
lad
tell
me
he
said
gravely
all
that
hath
befallen
thee
and
how
it
is
that
ye
seek
jesus
in
this
far
country
so
the
lad
told
him
all
how
that
their
parents
had
passed
into
the
regions
of
the
dead
leaving
them
alone
and
how
for
many
years
he
had
cared
for
his
blind
sister
of
the
man
who
would
have
sold
them
into
bondage
and
how
fleeing
from
before
his
face
they
had
first
heard
of
the
man
who
could
heal
blindness
of
their
awful
journey
in
the
wilderness
of
their
deliverance
from
the
vultures
and
their
escape
from
the
hand
of
pagiel
when
he
ceased
from
speaking
the
young
man
was
silent
for
a
space
of
a
surety
he
said
at
length
the
lord
hath
led
thee
then
raising
his
head
he
looked
up
into
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
sky
thou
who
hast
said
lo
i
am
with
thee
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
look
now
upon
this
child
who
hath
sought
thee
for
healing
through
weariness
and
thirst
and
pain
lo
these
many
days
and
heal
her
i
beseech
thee
by
the
hand
of
thy
servant
according
to
her
great
faith
then
stooping
while
the
lad
held
his
breath
with
awe
he
laid
his
hand
lightly
tenderly
upon
the
sightless
eyes
of
anat
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
of
nazareth
he
murmured
receive
thy
sight
and
into
the
dark
eyes
of
the
maiden
erstwhile
as
irresponsive
as
soulless
jewels
there
flashed
a
look
of
intelligence
she
gazed
steadfastly
into
the
eyes
of
the
stranger
art
thou
the
man
jesus
she
whispered
softly
nay
my
child
he
answered
i
am
but
his
servant
stephen
chapter
xv
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
to
abu
ben
hesed
sitting
as
was
his
wont
at
the
sunset
hour
in
the
door
of
his
tent
came
pagiel
it
was
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
after
he
had
seen
the
two
children
disappear
from
out
his
sight
on
the
back
of
the
white
dromedary
he
had
not
made
haste
to
return
he
needed
time
to
think
for
he
was
and
the
matter
in
hand
was
weighty
there
is
no
place
like
the
solitude
of
the
wilderness
for
meditation
quoth
pagiel
so
he
abode
quietly
in
the
place
where
he
was
for
one
full
day
not
so
the
son
of
kish
the
herdsman
he
was
impatient
let
me
return
i
beseech
thee
he
said
to
pagiel
i
would
fain
look
upon
the
face
of
my
bride
what
art
thou
saying
man
cried
pagiel
hotly
dost
thou
think
that
now
i
shall
give
to
thee
my
daughter
our
matter
is
ended
but
ben
kish
loved
the
daughter
of
pagiel
he
was
therefore
bold
and
determined
moreover
he
saw
that
the
man
was
afraid
to
return
my
father
is
wroth
he
said
because
the
two
egyptians
have
fled
away
with
the
beast
i
will
return
to
my
lord
and
i
will
tell
him
what
they
have
done
surely
it
was
meet
that
such
should
be
sold
into
slavery
and
that
their
value
be
given
the
daughter
of
pagiel
for
her
dowry
nay
thou
shalt
not
return
cried
pagiel
if
the
thing
be
told
ben
hesed
then
should
i
be
cut
off
from
among
my
kinsfolk
and
brethren
ben
kish
smiled
is
it
better
for
thee
to
be
thus
cut
off
he
said
or
to
have
for
thy
son
the
son
of
kish
for
of
these
two
things
one
shall
assuredly
come
to
pass
swear
to
me
that
thou
wilt
keep
the
thing
secret
said
pagiel
and
i
will
give
thee
my
daughter
even
as
i
have
said
swear
to
me
that
thou
wilt
give
me
thy
daughter
replied
ben
kish
and
i
will
keep
the
thing
secret
so
they
both
sware
a
great
oath
and
they
builded
that
day
of
the
stones
of
the
place
a
memorial
in
token
that
as
the
stones
which
endure
without
change
even
so
must
their
compact
remain
then
they
gat
them
up
and
made
haste
to
return
and
the
son
of
kish
laughed
within
himself
because
he
had
prevailed
but
pagiel
was
so
busy
inventing
a
tale
which
should
explain
the
loss
of
the
white
dromedary
that
he
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
ben
hesed
is
a
hard
man
he
thought
if
i
say
thieves
came
and
stole
the
beast
while
we
were
returning
he
will
say
why
then
didst
thou
not
pursue
and
slay
them
thou
hast
no
if
i
say
the
beast
fled
away
from
us
into
the
desert
he
will
laugh
me
to
scorn
nay
i
will
tell
him
the
truth
it
is
after
all
best
moreover
god
loveth
a
truthful
man
i
will
say
this
the
egyptian
brats
rose
up
whilst
we
were
asleep
in
the
midst
of
the
day
and
they
took
the
beast
and
fled
we
pursued
them
also
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
but
could
not
overtake
them
so
he
told
ben
hesed
this
and
when
he
had
done
speaking
he
waited
to
hear
what
his
lord
should
say
for
a
long
time
he
said
nothing
because
he
was
very
angry
and
it
was
his
wont
to
refrain
from
speaking
when
he
was
thus
disquieted
shall
a
man
rage
like
a
wild
beast
he
would
say
nay
for
in
so
doing
he
is
no
longer
a
man
let
him
rather
remain
silent
remembering
that
god
made
him
in
his
own
image
the
heavens
are
voiceless
even
when
the
earth
beneath
runs
red
with
blood
men
blaspheme
the
name
of
jehovah
yet
is
there
no
answering
bolt
of
wrath
to
slay
them
let
us
then
be
patient
as
befits
them
that
are
but
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
created
in
the
likeness
of
the
eternal
one
on
this
occasion
ben
hesed
was
silent
so
long
that
pagiel
was
frightened
he
had
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
and
he
still
remained
in
this
humble
posture
that
he
might
escape
the
lightnings
which
leapt
up
in
his
lord
s
eyes
as
he
heard
the
tale
after
a
time
he
became
very
uncomfortable
the
sand
on
which
his
forehead
rested
was
hot
his
knees
shook
beneath
him
why
do
i
abase
myself
before
this
man
he
said
within
himself
at
the
thought
he
too
grew
angry
and
because
anger
is
stronger
than
fear
he
leapt
up
and
stood
before
ben
hesed
ben
hesed
also
arose
i
will
myself
pursue
these
egyptians
he
said
and
i
will
bring
them
again
into
the
wilderness
the
wilderness
shall
avenge
me
then
he
made
haste
and
gat
him
gone
within
the
hour
but
pagiel
remained
behind
he
had
now
the
matter
of
the
marriage
in
hand
remembering
this
as
he
went
to
his
own
tent
he
again
tore
his
beard
and
cried
aloud
to
god
to
help
him
in
his
extremity
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
think
of
no
other
word
save
that
which
the
psalmist
david
wrote
the
wicked
plotteth
against
the
just
and
gnasheth
upon
him
with
his
teeth
but
the
lord
shall
laugh
at
him
for
he
seeth
that
his
day
is
coming
and
in
this
there
was
so
little
comfort
that
he
prayed
no
more
ben
hesed
arrived
at
the
borders
of
judæa
after
a
journey
which
consumed
but
half
the
usual
time
for
he
tarried
not
to
rest
at
noontide
nor
at
night
once
beyond
the
river
he
began
to
make
inquiry
among
the
people
concerning
the
white
dromedary
and
because
beasts
of
that
sort
and
color
not
often
passed
that
way
he
soon
found
them
that
had
seen
her
in
this
place
had
the
runaways
stayed
for
a
night
in
another
had
they
bartered
a
coin
from
the
girl
s
necklace
for
provender
for
the
beast
at
least
they
have
not
abused
the
animal
said
ben
hesed
to
himself
and
insensibly
his
anger
cooled
day
by
day
i
shall
hear
what
the
lad
hath
to
say
before
i
pass
judgment
upon
him
he
said
to
his
son
who
accompanied
him
it
is
best
to
look
at
both
sides
of
a
matter
yea
and
within
it
also
when
a
man
hath
done
this
to
the
best
of
his
ability
how
far
short
doth
he
fall
of
the
complete
knowledge
of
god
who
made
the
soul
and
to
whom
it
lieth
open
like
a
parchment
that
is
unrolled
therefore
should
man
leave
punishments
to
god
i
will
not
lift
my
hand
against
the
two
as
i
at
first
purposed
in
my
heart
and
in
this
thou
seest
my
son
how
wise
it
is
to
make
haste
slowly
in
matters
that
pertain
to
revenge
the
hours
that
pass
cool
the
angry
heart
even
as
drops
of
rain
quench
the
glowing
coals
this
is
good
a
year
from
now
i
shall
think
little
of
the
loss
of
the
beast
and
if
i
shew
mercy
it
will
endure
in
my
heart
for
many
years
as
a
sweet
savor
look
always
at
a
present
calamity
as
if
it
had
happened
many
moons
since
then
shalt
thou
be
able
to
judge
whether
it
be
worth
thy
while
to
be
angry
and
to
avenge
thyself
beguiling
the
way
with
good
words
of
the
like
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
a
wary
eye
out
for
the
white
dromedary
the
worthy
man
journeyed
on
towards
jerusalem
for
it
was
there
that
he
confidently
expected
to
find
the
fugitives
when
at
length
they
came
within
sight
of
the
holy
city
lying
fair
and
white
amid
the
green
and
gentle
mountain
slopes
the
travelers
were
amazed
to
see
the
numbers
of
folk
who
were
going
into
it
by
every
road
what
may
this
mean
said
ben
hesed
it
is
not
feast
time
presently
they
passed
one
of
these
companies
and
they
saw
that
in
the
midst
was
a
sick
man
on
his
litter
he
was
groaning
dismally
as
his
bed
shook
beneath
him
with
the
unevenness
of
the
way
why
dost
thou
fetch
this
man
into
jerusalem
asked
ben
hesed
of
the
bearers
to
be
healed
they
answered
him
happy
shall
we
be
if
we
get
him
there
alive
already
this
is
the
third
day
since
we
started
with
him
and
death
pursueth
after
us
faster
than
we
can
journey
ben
hesed
marvelled
at
their
answer
but
he
forbore
to
question
them
further
for
he
saw
that
they
had
no
mind
to
talk
presently
he
came
upon
a
woman
sitting
by
the
wayside
and
weeping
bitterly
why
dost
thou
weep
woman
he
asked
of
her
for
he
was
not
of
those
who
reckoned
it
a
defilement
to
speak
to
a
woman
i
weep
she
answered
him
because
although
i
am
in
sight
of
the
holy
city
i
can
go
no
further
and
my
child
must
after
all
perish
she
thrust
out
her
feet
from
beneath
her
robe
and
ben
hesed
saw
that
they
were
horribly
bruised
cut
and
blistered
as
if
she
had
walked
a
long
way
as
for
the
child
it
lay
and
silent
in
her
arms
the
purple
eyelids
half
dropped
over
the
dull
eyes
ben
hesed
shook
his
head
gravely
as
he
looked
at
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
beyond
help
thou
shalt
ride
upon
my
beast
he
said
and
thus
reach
the
city
speedily
i
will
walk
beside
thee
the
woman
smiled
through
her
tears
now
may
the
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
bless
thee
she
cried
then
she
looked
down
at
her
babe
and
her
face
whitened
it
may
be
too
late
she
murmured
from
whence
hast
thou
come
asked
ben
hesed
gently
from
beyond
jordan
in
the
hill
country
i
heard
of
what
was
being
done
in
jerusalem
and
so
when
my
babe
sickened
i
rose
up
with
him
and
hastened
to
come
hither
but
the
sickness
hath
increased
by
the
way
i
fear
the
man
jesus
is
of
great
power
interrupted
ben
hesed
hastily
it
hath
been
said
of
him
that
he
hath
even
raised
the
dead
the
woman
looked
startled
thou
art
then
a
stranger
in
these
parts
she
said
and
have
not
heard
what
hath
come
to
pass
of
late
in
jerusalem
i
am
from
the
wilderness
what
is
it
that
hath
come
to
pass
the
man
jesus
hath
been
slain
crucified
said
the
woman
her
heavy
eyes
blazing
with
indignation
ben
hesed
was
silent
for
a
moment
why
did
they
slay
him
he
asked
at
length
nay
i
know
not
said
the
woman
wearily
folding
the
child
close
to
her
bosom
i
saw
him
once
in
my
own
village
he
did
there
many
mighty
works
of
healing
and
of
the
things
which
he
said
i
remember
much
even
to
this
day
he
was
a
great
prophet
and
now
is
his
power
fallen
on
his
disciples
even
as
the
mantle
of
elijah
fell
upon
elisha
when
he
ascended
in
the
chariot
of
fire
and
had
therefore
no
further
need
of
a
mantle
ben
hesed
looked
once
more
at
the
city
to
which
they
were
now
drawing
very
near
thus
saith
the
lord
god
he
murmured
this
is
jerusalem
i
have
set
it
in
the
midst
of
the
nations
and
countries
that
are
round
about
her
the
end
is
at
hand
behold
it
watcheth
for
thee
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
land
the
time
is
come
the
day
of
trouble
is
near
now
will
i
shortly
pour
out
my
fury
upon
thee
and
accomplish
my
anger
upon
thee
and
i
will
judge
thee
according
to
thy
ways
and
will
recompense
thee
for
all
thine
abominations
for
the
land
is
full
of
bloody
crimes
and
the
city
is
full
of
violence
and
when
they
were
now
come
to
the
gates
they
had
much
ado
to
enter
in
because
of
the
great
multitude
of
the
sick
lame
and
blind
which
were
coming
from
every
quarter
the
streets
were
filled
with
them
and
with
the
noise
of
their
groaning
and
wailing
ben
hesed
his
son
and
his
two
servants
together
with
the
woman
who
still
held
the
quiet
child
close
to
her
bosom
followed
on
with
the
others
after
a
time
it
became
impossible
to
proceed
further
so
they
waited
where
they
were
near
them
two
men
were
holding
a
demoniac
who
bellowed
loudly
from
time
to
time
and
tore
at
his
clothes
which
were
already
in
ribbons
and
at
the
hair
and
faces
of
his
guardians
a
little
further
on
the
keen
eye
of
ben
hesed
descried
a
palsied
man
lying
on
his
bed
his
emaciated
face
the
color
of
death
beyond
him
were
a
group
of
blind
men
waiting
with
the
hopeless
apathy
of
accustomed
misery
for
something
they
scarce
knew
what
save
for
the
moans
and
cries
of
the
sick
ones
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
the
sun
beat
fiercely
down
from
above
the
yellow
dust
rose
in
stifling
clouds
from
beneath
and
still
they
waited
at
length
from
somewhere
afar
off
there
rose
a
cry
a
wild
jubilant
inarticulate
sound
a
deep
answering
murmur
arose
from
the
ghastly
throng
of
sufferers
about
them
this
strange
pean
of
joy
rose
and
fell
now
swelling
loudly
now
dying
away
but
always
drawing
nearer
ben
hesed
looked
at
the
woman
she
was
fumbling
wildly
at
the
wrappings
which
swathed
her
babe
she
bent
her
head
as
if
to
listen
at
his
tiny
chest
my
god
she
cried
it
is
too
late
he
is
dead
then
she
dropped
back
breathless
and
waxen
as
the
little
form
which
she
still
held
close
in
her
arms
ben
hesed
caught
her
as
she
fell
he
looked
about
him
for
help
here

a
voice
at
his
side
and
looking
up
he
saw
to
his
intense
astonishment
seth
the
egyptian
lad
at
the
same
moment
the
boy
recognized
him
and
started
back
with
a
little
cry
this
is
no
time
to
speak
of
what
concerneth
thee
and
me
said
ben
hesed
sternly
give
me
the
water
and
he
fell
to
sprinkling
the
face
of
the
woman
with
no
sparing
hand
they
are
coming
shouted
the
lad
stay
i
will
bring
him
hither
and
he
darted
away
into
the
throng
ben
hesed
looked
after
him
quietly
the
wicked
flee
when
no
man
pursueth
he
said
under
his
breath
yet
shall
sure
wrath
overtake
him
neither
shall
a

foot
deliver
him

he
added
turning
to
his
son
let
us

chapter
xvi
a
roll
of
parchment
thou
canst
hear
for
thyself
how
jerusalem
is
on
an
uproar
the
credulous
and
ignorant
from
all
the
country
round
about
are
crowding
into
the
city
bringing
their
sick
with
them
tis
worse
even
than
when
the
man
himself
was
alive
but
what
can
we
do
shorn
of
our
powers
as
we
be
what
indeed
but
shall
we
then
sit
quietly
down
and
allow
these
men
to
snatch
from
us
the
little
that
remains
annas
arose
from
his
place
as
he
spoke
and
opening
a
small
receptacle
of
carved
ivory
removed
from
it
a
roll
of
parchment
let
us
now
consider
this
matter
between
ourselves
later
it
must
be
presented
before
the
council
but
i
tell
you
plainly
that
in
the
council
itself
there
be
them
that
are
of
two
minds
i
have
written
here
he
continued
the
names
of
them
that
are
principally
concerned
in
the
present
disturbances
let
these
be
either
slain
or
forced
into
banishment
and
the
thousands
who
now
claim
to
believe
will
quickly
lose
their
fervor
which
is
after
all
simply
a
frenzy
of
excitement
skilfully
produced
by
these
apt
pupils
of
the
man
from
galilee
he
was
deliberately
unrolling
the
parchment
as
he
spoke
i
have
prepared
this
list
after
most
careful
inquiry
and
investigation
he
went
on
looking
keenly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
attentive
faces
before
him
to
thee
saul
of
tarsus
this
information
should
prove
most
useful
other
names
may
be
added
from
time
to
time
as
shall
appear
necessary
but
at
present
i
have
set
down
only
some
seventeen
names
including
the
twelve
who
companied
with
the
nazarene
these
are
now
i
am
told
known
as
apostles
and
it
is
they
who
are
the
principal
inciters
of
the
unseemly
gatherings
which
daily
take
place
within
the
confines
of
our
holy
temple
and
which
as
yet
we
have
not
been
able
to
put
a
stop
to
to
our
shame
be
it
said
the
names
the
names
cried
caiaphas
impatiently
read
them
i
pray
thee
without
further
delay
annas
frowned
thou
art
zealous
in
the
cause
my
son
he
said
with
a
warning
gesture
i
commend
thy
diligence
would
that
all
the
sanhedrim
were
of
like
mind
with
thyself
the
names
of
the
twelve
who
must
be
crushed
at
any
cost
are
as
follows
the
first
is
simon
also
called
peter
without
question
the
most
dangerous
of
them
all
in
that
he
is
absolutely
unbridled
of
tongue
and
apparently
without
fear
of
god
or
man
he
is
an
ignorant
fellow
having
been
taken
from
his
fishing
boat
on
gennesaret
by
the
nazarene
as
one
well
fitted
to
become
his
disciple
was
he
not
the
one
who
declared
with
curses
that
he
never
knew
the
nazarene
on
the
night
when
the
man
was
so
cleverly
given
over
to
us
by
that
other
follower
of
his
judas
said
caiaphas
thou
art
in
the
right
my
son
replied
annas
stroking
his
beard
thoughtfully
though
i
had
entirely
forgotten
the
circumstance
indeed
all
of
his
followers
forsook
the
man
and
fled
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
didst
thou
say
that
this
peter
denied
his
master
asked
saul
he
not
only
denied
knowing
him
but
cursed
and
blasphemed
foully
in
the
faces
of
them
that
inquired
of
him
concerning
the
matter
and
that
without
provocation
since
there
was
no
effort
made
to
molest
the
followers
of
the
nazarene
it
being
deemed
sufficient
by
us
at
the
time
to
put
an
end
to
the
man
himself
a
mistake
in
judgment
which
we
are
like
to
repent
bitterly
then
the
man
is
a
coward
exclaimed
saul
contemptuously
a
braggart
doubtless
a
roman
scourging
will
suffice
to
close
his
mouth
for
the
future
the
suggestion
is
a
good
one
said
annas
approvingly
it
can
be
brought
about
with
ease
though
for
myself
i
am
in
favor
of
measures
which
shall
entirely
rid
our
city
of
the
whole
blasphemous
brood
the
second
name
i
have
set
down
is
that
of
john
he
is
always
to
be
found
with
the
man
peter
of
whom
we
have
just
been
speaking
he
is
in
his
way
quite
as
dangerous
since
in
common
with
the
other
he
possesses
some
means
of
deluding
the
multitudes
into
supposing
that
he
hath
healing
power
there
is
a
way
provided
by
the
law
for
dealing
with
such
as
have
familiar
spirits
and
by
means
of
them
work
deeds
of
darkness
growled
caiaphas
quite
right
assented
annas
we
shall
come
to
that
presently
of
the
others
i
need
say
nothing
except
that
they
follow
the
same
practices
as
the
first
two
named
and
are
occupied
night
and
day
in
spreading
the
pernicious
teachings
of
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
the
good
tidings
i
will
name
them
in
order
commencing
at
the
beginning
once
more
simon
who
is
called
peter
and
andrew
brother
of
the
same
john
and
james
sons
of
zebedee
philip
bartholomew
thomas
matthew
a
tax
gatherer
james
ben
alphaeus
and
lebbaeus
surnamed
thaddeus
another
simon
who
is
a
canaanite
and
matthias
whom
i
find
they
have
chosen
to
take
the
place
of
the
man
judas
who
served
us
well
and
cheaply
you
will
remember
in
the
capture
of
the
nazarene
but
committed
the
incredible
folly
of
hanging
himself
immediately
afterward
a
pity
since
we
might
have
found
him
useful
now
to
these
twelve
names
i
have
also
added
mary
the
mother
of
the
nazarene
she
had
best
be
made
an
example
of
together
with
some
of
the
other
women
who
consort
with
the
men
and
brew
mischief
among
them
as
only
women
are
able
caiaphas
started
up
thou
hast
rightly
said
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
shaking
voice
the
devil
led
captive
the
first
woman
and
they
all
do
follow
him
to
this
day
if
he
but
put
on
the
guise
of
a
fair
youth
i
pray
thee
to
add
yet
another
name
the
name
of
stephen
murderer
and
thief
i
will
kill
him
with
my
hands
i
hate
him
i
my
son
said
annas
soothingly
thou
must
not
thyself
thy
zeal
for
the
holy
temple
hath
quite
caused
thee
to
overlook
the
frailty
of
thy
body
weakened
by
recent
illness
the
name
stephen
is
also
written
here
since
i
found
that
he
was
capable
of
leading
away
much
people
after
him
he
hath
a
nimble
tongue
and
a
fair
countenance
together
with
a
knowledge
of
the
lower
gentile
class
from
which
he
also
hath
sprung
being
as
his
name
indicates
of
greek
parentage
he
is
the
son
of
a
murderous
thief
shrieked
caiaphas
and
i
will
have
his
blood
i
assuredly
all
whose
names
are
written
here
are
under
sentence
of
death
said
annas
laying
a
warning
hand
on
the
speaker
s
arm
but
i
pray
thee
attend
me
while
i
finish
the
reading
of
the
parchment
after
that
must
we
take
immediate
action
i
have
here
further
set
down
for
your
consideration
the
apostates
nicodemus
and
joseph
of
arimathæa
formerly
members
of
the
sanhedrim
but
now
delivered
over
unto
ungodly
lusts
and
blasphemies
in
the
company
of
the
galileans
of
joseph
it
is
further
known
that
he
openly
begged
the
body
of
the
nazarene
from
pilate
and
made
a
great
ado
over
its
sepulture
buying
spices
and
fine
linen
as
if
for
a
rich
man
and
laying
the
fruit
of
the
accursed
tree
in
his
own
new
tomb
from
whence
it
also
disappeared
on
the
third
day
through
the
further
machinations
of
these
same
apostles
i
once
knew
joseph
of
arimathæa
remarked
saul
thoughtfully
he
was
a
man
i
will
speak
with
him
concerning
the
matter
not
so
my
son
cried
annas
hastily
i
forbid
it
in
the
name
of
the
holy
council
it
is
not
meet
for
one
that
is
sanctified
to
the
service
of
jehovah
to
consort
with
them
over
whom
satan
hath
gotten
the
victory
but
hold
i
hear
some
one
at
the
door
it
may
be
news
of
some
fresh
disturbance
i
ordered
the
captain
of
the
temple
police
to
bring
me
word
should
such
occur
enter
i
pray
thee
caleb
what
is
it
that
hath
befallen
a
great
tumult
my
good
lords
said
the
man
bowing
himself
reverently
before
them
the
men
have
wrought
many
wonderful
cures
upon
the
halt
the
maimed
and
the
blind
the
whole
city
is
at
the
doors
to
see
them
they
are
bringing
out
their
sick
and
laying
them
on
the
stones
of
the
street
crying
out
that
if
only
the
shadow
of
peter
fall
on
them
they
shall
be
healed
this
is
monstrous
cried
annas
starting
up
do
thou
saul
of
tarsus
go
with
this
man
and
see
to
it
that
these
fellows
are
put
in
hold
their
shadows
will
go
with
them
thrust
them
into
the
common
prison
and
let
the
jailer
look
to
it
that
they
escape
not
take
with
thee
a
sufficient
number
for
thy
security
and
accomplish
the
matter
quietly
but
with
all
speed
we
will
consider
their
case
saul
of
tarsus
was
already
girding
himself
thy
commands
my
lord
shall
be
obeyed
he
said
bending
his
haughty
head
and
i
rejoice
that
i
am
counted
worthy
to
be
of
service
in
bringing
to
naught
these
workers
of
iniquity
if
it
meets
with
thy
approval
i
shall
also
put
in
hold
any
others
whom
i
shall
find
engaged
in
this
blasphemous
wickedness
go
forth
my
son
quoth
annas
rolling
up
his
eyes
and
spreading
abroad
his
jewelled
fingers
and
take
with
thee
a
blessing
may
it
enable
thee
to
prevail
gloriously
deal
with
the
men
as
thou
wilt
only
remember
that
we
must
be
prudent
and
that
too
great
zeal
in
the
beginning
oftentimes
cripples
an
enterprise
which
would
otherwise
have
grown
mighty
and
irresistible
therefore
temper
thy
burning
zeal
with
all
caution
and
diligence
as
befits
a
truly
wise
man
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
the
door
closed
after
the
young
pharisee
a
most
admirable
man
for
the
occasion
he
exclaimed
turning
to
caiaphas
most
admirable
full
of
courage
full
of
determination
withal
easy
to
be
controlled
but
i
would
not
that
he
talk
much
of
the
matter
with
any
other
save
ourselves
if
he
should
hear
the
talk
of
nicodemus
joseph
or
barsabas
i
fear
me
that
he
might
receive
an
impetus
in
the
wrong
direction
and
once
started
there
would
be
no
halfway
measures
with
him
he
would
speedily
develop
into
another
peter
on
our
hands
dost
thou
in
truth
believe
that
these
men
are
of
the
devil
annas
started
the
smile
faded
he
looked
sharply
into
the
worn
face
before
him
at
the
eyes
with
their
feverish
glitter
at
the
thin
nerveless
hands
at
the
bowed
shoulders
then
he
frowned
thou
had
best
go
to
thy
chamber
he
began
irritably
but
caiaphas
checked
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
prate
not
to
me
of
my
chamber
i
am
sick
yes
but
it
is
a
sickness
of
the
soul
thou
dost
not
know
all
i
have
not
told
thee
but
hear
now
that
my
son
my
son
david
was
crucified
as
a
thief
at
the
right
hand
of
the
nazarene
his
voice
rose
almost
to
a
shriek
at
the
last
word
and
he
tore
at
his
hair
as
one
in
uncontrollable
agony
annas
started
to
his
feet
thou
art
mad
he
cried
for
god
s
sake
do
not
shriek
forth
such
foul
ravings
lest
it
come
to
the
ears
of
them
without
nay
i
am
not
mad
said
caiaphas
if
i
were
mad
i
might
sometimes
forget
thou
knowest
how
we
lost
him
he
continued
sinking
his
voice
to
a
husky
whisper
he
was
stolen
by
a
thief
who
bred
him
to
his
own
damnable
trade
and
who
also
was
crucified
this
stephen
who
preaches
to
the
people
of
the
nazarene
is
his
son
it
was
stephen
who
taught
the
woman
who
was
my
wife
to
believe
that
the
nazarene
was
the
messiah
of
israel
what
if
it
were
true
my
god
if
it
were
true
fool
cried
annas
clenching
his
hands
breathe
to
another
human
soul
what
thou
hast
told
me
and
i
will
thrust
thee
into
a
dungeon
where
thou
shalt
cool
thy
hot
brain
to
eternity
wilt
thou
drag
our
ancient
name
in
the
foul
mud
of
the
streets
and
make
it
a
and
a
hissing
this
fellow
stephen
shall
die
and
that
speedily
now
look
to
it
that
thy
tongue
is
forevermore
silent
in
the
matter
dost
thou
hear
me
caiaphas
cowered
beneath
the
murderous
eyes
of
the
old
man
it
shall
be
as
thou
hast
said
he
faltered
weakly
then
he
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobbing
like
a
sick
child
chapter
xvii
in
the
prison
house
it
was
very
dark
in
the
prison
and
the
straw
which
littered
the
earthen
floor
of
the
place
was
damp
and
filthy
abu
ben
hesed
found
a
difficulty
in
breathing
the
stagnant
air
he
groaned
aloud
and
beat
upon
his
breast
alas
he
sighed
how
have
the
wicked
prevailed
against
the
innocent
we
are
as
birds
in
the
snare
of
the
fowler
the
babe
in
the
arms
of
the
woman
beside
him
stirred
then
wailed
loudly
i
have
no
food
for
him
said
the
woman
plaintively
nevertheless
he
hath
the
strength
to
wail
for
it
thanks
be
to
the
almighty
but
how
doth
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
always
commingle
no
sooner
is
my
child
restored
than
i
am
thrust
into
this
noisome
place
for
what
reason
i
know
not
i
but
praised
him
by
whose
name
was
the
healing
wrought
thinkest
thou
not
that
he
who
hath
restored
thy
babe
is
able
likewise
to
deliver
thee
from
prison
said
a
deep
voice
from
out
the
gloom
the
woman
drew
a
little
nearer
to
abu
ben
hesed
who
is
it
that
speaks
she
whispered
timidly
while
the
child
again
wailed
loudly
ben
hesed
turned
his
piercing
gaze
toward
the
place
from
whence
the
voice
had
come
he
thought
he
could
distinguish
a
number
of
dark
figures
huddled
together
in
one
corner
who
are
our
companions
in
this
misery
he
asked
we
are
the
apostles
of
the
lord
jesus
in
whose
name
we
are
able
to
heal
them
that
are
sick
by
the
command
of
the
chief
priests
are
we
thrust
into
this
place
the
officers
who
seized
us
are
well
known
unto
us
but
praises
be
to
the
eternal
one
that
we
are
accounted
worthy
to
do
the
works
which
the
lord
did
and
to
be
partakers
of
his
sufferings
for
unto
us
shall
be
also
a
share
in
his
glory
which
he
hath
with
the
father
but
how
is
it
that
ye
are
come
with
us
into
this
place
i
am
from
the
desert
answered
ben
hesed
as
i
journeyed
i
found
by
the
wayside
this
woman
who
had
essayed
to
bring
her
babe
to
jerusalem
for
healing
when
i
perceived
that
she
could
go
no
further
by
reason
of
her
weariness
i
set
her
upon
my
own
beast
and
fetched
her
into
the
city
as
we
waited
hemmed
in
on
every
side
by
the
multitude
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
child
was
dead
therefore
i
bore
her
away
a
little
from
out
the
throng
because
the
spirit
was
well
nigh
gone
out
of
her
by
reason
of
her
grief
then
it
was
that
a
little
lad
called
seth
brought
unto
us
a
young
man
who
laid
his
hands
on
the
twain
and
healed
them
i
saw
it
with
mine
own
eyes
as
did
they
that
were
with
me
and
we
all
cried
aloud
and
praised
god
for
his
mercy
the
woman
also
with
a
voice
of
thanksgiving
but
as
we
rejoiced
there
came
a
certain
man
who
commanded
us
to
be
silent
shall
i
be
silent
i
answered
him
when
mine
eyes
have
seen
wondrous
things
then
i
bade
him
begone
for
it
is
not
my
custom
to
hear
or
to
heed
commands
from
any
since
i
am
lord
in
mine
own
land
but
even
as
i
spoke
i
was
seized
on
a
sudden
from
behind
by
them
that
bound
me
and
haled
me
away
hither
together
with
the
woman
for
this
also
shall
vengeance
overtake
the
man
for
i
will
neither
eat
bread
nor
drink
wine
till
i
have
accomplished
my
wrath
upon
mine
enemy
i
ben
hesed
have
spoken
it
nay
my
brother
said
another
voice
i
will
show
thee
a
more
excellent
way
the
lord
jesus
when
he
was
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
cruel
men
who
also
accomplished
their
desires
upon
him
reviling
him
beating
him
and
at
last
crucifying
him
though
he
was
endued
with
all
power
from
on
high
offered
no
resistance
even
as
it
is
written
by
the
prophet
isaiah
he
was
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
he
was
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
opened
not
his
if
the
holy
jesus
lord
of
all
the
heavens
could
endure
such
suffering
with
patience
is
it
meet
for
sinful
man
to
seek
for
vengeance
ben
hesed
listened
attentively
i
would
hear
more
of
this
man
jesus
he
said
i
once
saw
him
in
jerusalem
he
seemed
to
me
a
man
even
as
others
though
it
was
told
me
that
he
had
the
power
to
heal
them
that
were
afflicted
with
diseases
then
they
told
him
all
the
story
of
jesus
of
nazareth
and
when
they
spoke
of
his
awful
death
on
the
cross
the
old
man
wept
aloud
would
to
god
that
i
had
known
it
he
cried
i
would
have
come
with
my
tribe
like
a
swift
whirlwind
from
out
the
desert
and
would
have
snatched
him
from
the
hand
of
the
oppressor
in
the
desert
god
reigns
doth
not
god
reign
over
all
the
earth
for
he
made
it
cried
peter
yet
he
suffered
these
things
so
to
be
it
was
his
will
concerning
him
as
also
our
lord
told
us
many
times
before
his
death
yet
because
of
our
blindness
we
heeded
him
not
yea
i
even
denied
that
i
knew
him
in
his
extremity
yet
he
forgave
me
as
also
he
will
forgive
and
save
all
that
come
unto
him
how
can
he
forgive
when
he
is
dead
said
the
woman
sadly
behold
there
is
no
hope
in
the
grave
they
that
go
down
unto
death
return
not
for
either
loving
or
forgiving
though
we
weep
tears
of
blood
in
our
anguish
hast
thou
not
heard
cried
peter
in
amaze
how
that
the
grave
could
not
hold
him
on
the
third
day
he
became
alive
again
and
we
all
saw
him
and
knew
by
many
infallible
proofs
that
it
was
he
and
no
other
and
as
he
arose
from
among
the
dead
even
so
shall
every
one
that
believeth
on
him
also
become
alive
again
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
after
many
days
with
our
own
eyes
did
we
behold
the
heavens
receive
him
yet
is
he
even
now
with
us
to
help
and
to
comfort
and
shall
be
alway
even
unto
the
end
while
he
yet
spake
lo
all
the
place
became
light
about
them
and
they
saw
that
the
doors
of
the
prison
stood
wide
open
and
while
they
marvelled
at
the
sight
a
man
in
bright
raiment
stood
before
them
and
said
go
stand
and
speak
in
the
temple
all
the
words
of
this
life
and
they
went
forth
all
of
them
into
the
night
but
the
keepers
of
the
prison
continued
to
stand
before
the
doors
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
what
had
happened
for
their
eyes
were
holden
by
the
angel
ben
hesed
was
baptized
in
that
same
hour
and
so
likewise
was
the
woman
because
they
believed
what
the
men
had
told
them
concerning
jesus
of
nazareth
and
they
tarried
for
the
night
at
the
house
of
john
but
in
the
morning
very
early
the
apostles
went
into
the
temple
that
they
might
speak
to
the
people
even
as
the
angel
had
bidden
them
about
the
third
hour
of
the
day
at
the
bidding
of
annas
came
the
members
of
the
sanhedrim
with
the
chief
doctors
of
the
law
and
all
the
great
rabbis
that
were
at
jerusalem
that
they
might
take
council
together
concerning
them
which
saul
had
made
fast
in
the
prison
and
when
annas
had
spoken
before
them
at
length
concerning
the
matter
and
with
great
power
and
subtilty
had
convinced
the
greater
part
of
them
that
these
men
were
of
the
devil
and
that
upon
the
senate
thus
convened
rested
the
honor
and
safety
of
israel
he
commanded
that
the
prisoners
should
be
brought
and
the
officers
went
as
they
were
bidden
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
prison
they
asked
of
them
that
stood
on
guard
before
the
door
whether
the
prisoners
had
been
troublesome
during
the
night
we
heard
them
speaking
one
to
another
about
the
third
watch
the
officer
of
the
guard
made
answer
but
there
has
been
neither
sound
nor
motion
from
within
for
many
hours
they
sleep
heavily
and
late
they
must
even
awake
now
that
they
may
appear
before
the
council
fetch
them
out
at
once
for
i
must
make
haste
then
the
officer
of
the
guard
whose
name
was
chilion
opened
the
door
of
the
prison
and
went
in
awake
sluggards
he
cried
loudly
and
come
forth
but
when
there
was
yet
neither
voice
nor
motion
he
drew
his
sword
and
thrust
it
in
among
the
heaps
of
mouldy
straw
if
ye
will
not
come
forth
peaceably
he
said
then
shall
i
fetch
thee
forth
at
the
point
of
the
sword
but
no
shriek
of
pain
answered
the
weapon
so
he
strode
forth
into
the
light
fetch
hither
a
torch
he
roared
there
is
the
darkness
of
the
pit
within
and
the
rascals
make
me
no
answer
so
they
made
haste
and
fetched
lights
and
they
searched
the
prison
with
all
diligence
the
prisoners
were
gone
thou
hast
been
drunken
in
the
night
and
so
have
the
fellows
eluded
thee
said
caleb
the
chief
of
the
temple
police
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
men
had
indeed
made
good
their
escape
for
this
shalt
thou
answer
with
a
scourging
thou
liest
man
i
have
neither
eaten
bread
nor
tasted
wine
during
the
night
cried
chilion
choking
with
rage
and
these
shall
bear
me
witness
we
have
stood
continually
before
the
doors
even
as
thou
didst
find
us
it
is
from
within
that
they
have
gotten
away
then
they
again
examined
the
floor
and
the
walls
of
the
prison
but
there
was
no
place
where
so
much
as
a
mouse
could
have
crept
through
i
am
undone
cried
chilion
rending
his
clothes
if
they
be
not
found
twas
by
their
magic
powers
that
they
have
done
this
thing
thinkest
thou
that
men
who
can
open
the
eyes
of
the
blind
can
not
also
open
the
doors
of
a
prison
house
so
caleb
returned
unto
the
council
and
when
he
had
made
obeisance
before
them
he
said
i
am
most
unhappy
my
lords
in
that
i
am
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
the
prisoners
whom
i
was
sent
to
fetch
have
somehow
made
good
their
escape
during
the
night
how
is
this
cried
annas
angrily
who
guarded
the
prison
the
detachment
of
chilion
with
chilion
himself
in
command
my
lord
the
prison
was
shut
with
all
safety
and
the
keepers
found
we
standing
without
before
the
doors
but
when
we
had
opened
there
was
no
man
within
a
most
singular
story
this
my
lord
remarked
alexander
sarcastically
it
will
doubtless
transpire
that
the
fellows
reasoned
with
the
keepers
during
the
night
watches
and
so
converted
them
from
their
duty
to
their
own
interests
this
do
they
with
all
men
the
guard
chilion
hath
been
bribed
suggested
another
fetch
him
hither
and
try
the
effect
of
a
scourging
a
bleeding
back
createth
an
honest
tongue
oftentimes
when
nothing
else
will
suffice
but
as
they
thus
talked
together
chilion
himself
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
he
was
admitted
he
cried
out
before
them
all
that
he
was
innocent
of
any
failure
in
his
duty
he
was
moreover
ready
to
swear
to
the
truth
of
this
upon
the
high
altar
of
the
temple
than
which
there
was
no
oath
more
sacred
as
for
the
men
whom
ye
put
in
prison
he
added
they
are
at
this
moment
standing
in
the
temple
teaching
the
people
chapter
xviii
whose
we
are
and
whom
we
serve
may
i
advise
my
lord
that
these
men
be
at
once
apprehended
and
brought
hither
the
voice
was
that
of
saul
of
tarsus
he
had
arisen
in
his
place
and
the
eyes
of
all
were
fixed
upon
him
we
shall
then
be
able
to
examine
them
of
the
truth
of
this
man
s
statements
it
would
seem
most
necessary
that
our
prisons
be
made
secure
since
i
opine
that
we
shall
have
need
of
them
before
we
have
seen
an
end
to
this
matter
it
is
well
said
murmured
several
who
were
high
in
authority
let
them
be
fetched
with
all
speed
we
will
not
go
hence
until
we
have
seen
them
so
annas
commanded
the
officers
fetch
hither
the
men
but
without
show
of
violence
for
they
have
a
great
following
among
the
people
a
popular
enthusiasm
he
added
when
bred
at
the
wrong
moment
and
on
the
wrong
subject
is
most
disastrous
though
what
it
may
accomplish
when
properly
directed
those
of
you
who
were
in
the
city
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
man
from
galilee
will
remember
the
populace
must
be
with
us
now
as
they
were
then
caleb
therefore
with
a
chosen
few
of
his
men
sought
the
temple
and
there
they
found
a
great
multitude
assembled
in
solomon
s
porch
listening
to
the
apostles
who
spoke
to
them
of
jesus
the
crucified
carpenter
of
galilee
him
they
declared
boldly
to
be
the
prince
of
israel
assuring
the
people
that
though
he
had
been
rejected
by
them
and
cruelly
slain
yet
was
he
able
to
save
them
from
out
the
sin
and
misery
of
their
present
lives
and
furthermore
give
them
everlasting
life
in
place
of
death
so
that
for
them
that
believed
there
was
now
no
further
terror
in
the
grave
since
he
had
promised
and
was
able
to
raise
their
corrupt
bodies
into
the
likeness
of
his
own
glorious
body
and
all
the
people
heard
their
words
with
joy
and
they
cried
aloud
to
the
crucified
one
to
forgive
them
their
sins
and
to
remember
his
promises
to
them
also
when
the
chief
captain
of
the
temple
police
was
seen
to
approach
stealthily
a
man
whose
long
silvery
beard
descended
upon
his
breast
and
in
whose
eyes
burned
the
fire
of
desert
suns
cried
out
seest
thou
these
men
they
are
even
as
the
leopard
of
the
mountain
which
steals
upon
his
prey
unaware
look
to
it
now
that
they
do
the
men
of
god
no
violence
and
the
people
answered
with
a
great
shout
let
us
stone
them
forthwith
if
they
be
dead
they
will
trouble
us
no
more
and
caleb
feared
exceedingly
lest
they
should
lay
hands
upon
him
but
being
a
discreet
man
and
in
pursuit
of
his
duty
furthermore
he
made
a
bold
stand
before
them
ye
men
of
israel
he
cried
there
is
no
violence
intended
these
men
if
they
will
but
come
with
me
peaceably
the
council
and
senate
of
the
people
of
israel
would
hear
them
of
these
matters
whereof
they
are
now
preaching
and
for
this
purpose
have
they
even
now
assembled
themselves
together
let
the
apostles
go
i
pray
ye
that
those
in
high
places
may
also
receive
the
gospel
this
he
said
not
because
he
himself
believed
but
because
he
was
a
man
of
wisdom
and
knew
that
unless
he
could
placate
the
multitude
great
harm
might
come
not
only
to
himself
but
to
the
senate
also
should
these
men
once
accuse
the
chief
priests
of
the
murder
of
the
nazarene
he
said
within
himself
the
mob
would
immediately
hale
them
forth
from
the
council
chamber
and
tear
them
limb
from
limb
and
for
a
moment
he
was
half
minded
to
send
word
to
the
citadel
asking
for
a
detachment
of
roman
soldiers
but
he
bethought
himself
that
this
would
only
betray
his
fear
so
he
again
spoke
and
this
time
in
the
ear
of
peter
i
beseech
thee
good
rabbi
he
said
with
apparent
humility
that
thou
wilt
appease
the
people
since
thou
art
obeyed
of
them
and
i
despite
mine
office
have
no
authority
at
all
over
them
call
not
thou
me
good
who
denied
the
lord
of
glory
answered
peter
i
will
go
with
thee
then
he
beckoned
with
his
hand
unto
the
multitude
that
they
should
pay
him
heed
and
when
they
were
silent
expecting
that
he
would
command
them
concerning
the
officers
he
said
ye
men
of
israel
this
jesus
whom
we
preach
unto
you
while
he
was
yet
alive
commanded
that
they
which
would
follow
him
should
do
no
evil
to
any
man
yea
he
declared
that
if
a
man
should
smite
his
neighbor
on
the
cheek
that
the
smitten
one
should
also
suffer
his
enemy
to
smite
again
without
resistance
or
anger
and
when
on
the
night
before
his
death
the
chief
priests
sent
a
company
of
men
armed
with
swords
and
staves
for
to
seize
him
i
was
filled
with
indignation
and
smote
the
high
priest
s
servant
with
the
sword
so
that
his
ear
was
severed
from
his
head
but
the
lord
rebuked
me
and
bade
me
put
up
my
sword
into
its
place
then
he
reached
forth
his
hand
and
touched
the
wounded
man
and
healed
him
furthermore
ye
remember
how
that
afterward
when
he
was
mocked
and
scourged
and
spit
upon
by
his
enemies
he
opened
not
his
mouth
with
revilings
but
bore
all
with
patience
though
there
remained
within
his
call
more
than
twelve
legions
of
angels
armed
with
the
fiery
swords
of
heaven
if
then
ye
would
follow
him
on
whom
ye
have
believed
give
place
to
wrath
and
conduct
yourselves
peaceably
for
ye
may
have
confidence
that
the
lord
christ
whose
we
are
and
whom
we
serve
will
not
suffer
us
to
be
tried
above
that
we
can
bear
but
will
with
the
necessity
provide
a
way
of
escape
and
when
the
people
heard
these
words
they
suffered
the
apostles
to
go
away
with
the
officers
but
ben
hesed
and
with
him
others
of
them
that
were
followed
hard
after
and
waited
near
the
door
of
the
council
chamber
for
said
ben
hesed
grimly
it
is
also
written
concerning
the
lord
with
the
merciful
thou
wilt
show
thyself
merciful
and
with
the
froward
thou
wilt
show
thyself
froward
the
lord
will
save
the
afflicted
people
but
he
will
bring
down
high
looks
and
further
he
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
so
that
a
bow
of
steel
is
broken
by
my
arms
i
have
pursued
mine
enemies
and
overtaken
them
neither
did
i
turn
again
till
they
were
and
when
caleb
perceived
that
the
men
were
even
at
the
doors
he
wrote
upon
a
tablet
saying
be
discreet
i
pray
thee
in
thy
dealings
with
these
apostles
for
there
be
them
without
which
are
able
to
make
of
thee
and
of
all
that
are
within
even
as
the
small
dust
of
the
balance
and
this
he
caused
to
be
given
to
annas
privily
when
annas
had
read
these
words
his
heart
burned
like
a
live
coal
within
him
yet
was
his
brow
calm
and
unruffled
as
he
fixed
his
keen
eyes
on
the
men
who
stood
humbly
enough
in
the
presence
of
that
imposing
assembly
again
hath
it
become
necessary
to
rebuke
you
openly
because
of
your
blasphemous
conduct
and
ignorant
fishermen
how
is
it
that
ye
do
thus
persist
in
doing
the
things
which
work
only
for
unrighteousness
did
not
we
straightly
command
you
that
ye
should
not
teach
in
this
name
and
behold
ye
have
filled
jerusalem
with
your
doctrine
and
intend
to
bring
the
blood
of
the
slain
nazarene
upon
us
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
man
affirmed
peter
simply
annas
trembled
with
his
pent
up
anger
but
he
still
spoke
with
calmness
this
have
ye
before
declared
as
the
reason
and
excuse
of
your
disobedience
to
this
most
holy
council
of
the
people
of
israel
dost
thou
think
then
that
the
god
of
our
fathers
speaks
no
longer
save
to
fisher
folk
publicans
and
malefactors
nay
for
upon
us
doth
rest
the
power
of
god
and
the
wisdom
of
god
in
that
we
would
defend
from
scurrilous
and
wicked
hands
the
faith
which
we
have
kept
unsullied
from
the
days
of
our
father
abraham
even
until
now
we
have
but
one
answer
to
make
to
this
said
john
looking
squarely
into
the
furious
eyes
of
the
man
who
had
spoken
and
it
is
this
the
god
of
our
fathers
raised
up
jesus
whom
ye
slew
and
hanged
on
a
tree
him
hath
god
exalted
with
his
right
hand
to
be
a
prince
and
a
saviour
that
he
might
give
repentance
to
israel
and
forgiveness
of
sins
and
we
are
his
witnesses
of
these
things
and
so
is
also
the
holy
spirit
whom
god
hath
given
to
them
that
obey
him
hearest
thou
these
sayings
cried
annas
starting
to
his
feet
what
is
this
else
but
foul
blasphemy
it
is
poison
of
this
kind
that
these
fellows
spread
industriously
amongst
the
people
day
by
day
the
nazarene
a
prince
and
saviour
forsooth
and
we
his
murderers
if
the
people
once
come
to
believe
this
what
shall
come
to
pass
we
shall
be
overthrown
and
the
whole
nation
given
over
to
blasphemy
and
idolatry
we
shall
be
doing
god
service
if
we
immediately
put
these
to
death
said
jochanan
it
must
needs
be
done
the
public
weal
demands
it
i
am
of
the
same
mind
exclaimed
alexander
and
i
and
i
shouted
half
a
score
of
voices
let
them
be
stoned
give
them
over
to
the
romans
i
beseech
your
indulgence
my
good
lords
interrupted
a
grave
deep
voice
from
the
inner
circle
of
the
assembly
that
ye
may
grant
a
brief
hearing
to
one
who
because
he
is
still
somewhat
unfamiliar
with
these
new
doctrines
perchance
looks
upon
them
from
a
slightly
different
standpoint
from
those
of
you
who
have
patiently
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
gamaliel
gamaliel
cried
several
voices
let
us
hear
what
he
hath
to
say
the
speaker
was
a
man
of
powerful
physique
and
of
calm
and
dignified
bearing
as
he
looked
keenly
about
over
the
excited
assemblage
with
an
air
of
conscious
authority
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
with
grave
attention
may
i
request
he
continued
when
the
tumult
of
excited
voices
had
died
away
into
silence
that
the
persons
under
discussion
be
put
forth
for
a
little
space
this
command
being
obeyed
with
alacrity
by
the
underlings
of
caleb
the
speaker
resumed
in
a
deep
measured
voice
as
i
have
listened
to
the
sayings
of
these
men
he
said
my
mind
hath
sought
the
past
for
it
is
in
the
experiences
of
years
gone
by
that
man
hath
ever
found
the
best
council
for
the
exigencies
of
the
present
to
adopt
excessive
measures
for
the
disruption
of
this
new
sect
would
in
my
opinion
be
not
only
unwise
in
the
present
disturbed
state
of
the
populace
but
actually
dangerous
i
have
mingled
with
the
multitude
and
i
know
that
whereof
i
speak
therefore
take
heed
to
yourselves
what
ye
intend
to
do
as
touching
these
men
turning
as
i
have
suggested
to
the
annals
of
the
past
we
find
that
before
these
days
there
rose
up
a
certain
theudas
boasting
himself
to
be
somebody
to
whom
a
number
of
men
about
four
hundred
joined
themselves
after
a
time
he
was
slain
in
a
brawl
and
all
who
believed
on
him
were
speedily
scattered
and
brought
to
naught
again
somewhat
later
appeared
judas
a
galilean
in
the
days
of
the
taxing
and
drew
away
much
people
after
him
he
also
perished
and
those
who
had
obeyed
him
were
dispersed
so
now
i
say
unto
you
refrain
from
these
men
and
let
them
alone
for
if
this
preaching
and
healing
which
they
do
be
of
men
it
will
speedily
come
to
naught
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
of
god
ye
can
not
overthow
it
lest
haply
ye
be
found
to
fight
against
god
a
deep
murmur
of
approval
followed
these
words
after
which
a
number
of
the
more
influential
ones
expressed
themselves
as
in
favor
of
adopting
the
safe
and
conservative
course
recommended
by
the
wise
doctor
of
the
laws
who
had
spoken
presently
when
all
had
been
said
annas
arose
and
looked
about
him
in
the
hush
that
followed
the
tumult
of
the
surging
multitudes
without
could
be
distinctly
heard
though
i
believe
that
these
men
and
their
works
are
neither
of
man
nor
of
god
but
of
the
devil
he
began
his
voice
shaking
with
suppressed
excitement
yet
is
the
devil
ever
watchful
of
his
own
and
the
populace
are
not
to
be
trifled
with
at
the
present
moment
therefore
do
i
agree
with
the
worshipful
gamaliel
in
thinking
that
the
safe
course
for
ourselves
and
for
the
cause
which
we
serve
will
be
as
he
hath
suggested
to
let
the
men
be
for
the
present
i
am
not
without
hope
of
interesting
herod
in
the
matter
let
it
come
to
his
ears
once
that
these
fellows
are
preaching
to
the
people
that
their
master
is
shortly
coming
back
to
establish
his
throne
in
jerusalem
as
i
can
bring
witnesses
to
testify
and
he
will
speedily
take
care
of
them
that
say
such
things
i
will
therefore
command
that
the
men
be
scourged
in
our
presence
which
may
prove
a
wholesome
corrective
to
their
mistaken
zeal
after
that
they
shall
be
released
this
accordingly
was
done
the
dignitaries
looking
on
calmly
whilst
the
scourging
was
administered
by
the
underlings
of
the
temple
police
when
the
sickening
sound
of
the
blows
had
at
length
ceased
annas
again
spoke
there
is
somewhat
that
ye
have
still
to
answer
for
he
said
how
is
it
that
ye
made
good
your
escape
from
the
prison
these
your
guards
declare
that
they
stood
continually
before
the
doors
from
the
evening
when
ye
were
incarcerated
even
until
the
morning
the
face
of
john
glowed
with
a
celestial
light
the
angel
of
the
lord
whose
we
are
and
whom
we
serve
came
and
fetched
us
out
and
the
eyes
of
the
keepers
were
holden
that
they
wist
not
when
we
went
by
them
annas
eyed
the
speaker
with
a
mocking
smile
how
is
it
he
said
slowly
his
eyes
lingering
with
manifest
satisfaction
upon
the
crimson
marks
of
the
scourging
that
he
who
delivered
fhee
from
the
prison
house
was
not
able
also
to
deliver
thee
from
the
hands
of
them
that
beat
thee
we
were
delivered
from
the
prison
that
we
might
speak
to
the
people
of
him
who
is
able
to
save
them
from
their
sins
answered
john
then
he
also
smiled
but
it
was
as
an
angel
might
have
smiled
on
whom
the
king
immortal
invisible
had
conferred
some
high
and
heavenly
boon
the
servant
is
not
above
his
lord
he
said
and
if
we
suffer
with
him
we
shall
also
reign
with
him
he
hath
gone
to
prepare
a
place
for
us
that
where
he
is
there
we
may
be
also
then
annas
rose
in
his
wrath
let
what
ye
have
received
at
our
hands
serve
to
remind
you
that
ye
are
forbidden
to
speak
the
name
of
the
crucified
galilean
in
jerusalem
further
disobedience
shall
meet
with
a
punishment
to
which
this
shall
be
as
nothing
then
were
the
apostles
thrust
out
from
the
council
chamber
and
they
departed
rejoicing
greatly
that
they
were
counted
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
name
and
daily
in
the
temple
and
in
every
house
where
dwelt
them
that
believed
they
ceased
not
to
teach
and
preach
jesus
christ
chapter
xix
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
then
thou
wilt
not
go
with
me
this
morning
nay
i
must
not
this
morning
i
am
to
learn
how
to
spin
the
mother
of
jesus
will
teach
me
afterward
i
shall
make
for
thee
a
tunic
now
thou
seest
what
a
thing
it
is
to
have
eyes
anat
looked
down
at
the
small
hands
which
lay
folded
in
her
lap
these
she
continued
spreading
out
the
slender
brown
fingers
have
hitherto
been
as
idle
as
the
hands
of
a
princess
but
the
lady
mary
says
that
they
must
learn
many
things
if
with
them
i
would
serve
him
that
healed
me
seth
looked
half
regretfully
into
the
eager
face
then
we
shall
no
more
dwell
by
ourselves
as
heretofore
hast
thou
forgotten
the
desert
i
have
not
forgotten
but
i
would
like
to
stay
here
and
the
dromedary
thou
must
find
it
it
was
not
i
who
would
leave
it
without
in
the
hands
of
a
stranger
the
lord
of
the
desert
is
just
in
requiring
it
at
thy
hands
the
lad
turned
away
be
it
so
he
cried
angrily
till
i
have
found
it
thou
wilt
see
my
face
no
more
if
that
be
never
why
then
seth
seth
stay
a
moment
my
brother
do
not
leave
me
so
but
he
was
gone
and
without
turning
his
head
how
can
i
find
the
beast
he
muttered
to
himself
crossly
as
he
plunged
into
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
i
have
asked
everywhere
for
the
man
gestas
no
one
knows
him
as
for
the
white
dromedary
men
look
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
witless
fool
when
i
speak
of
it
if
now
i
were
in
egypt
i
should
offer
a
libation
to
ptah
hotep
or
fetch
a
garland
to
the
temple
of
the
sacred
bull
then
might
i
receive
wisdom
if
i
pray
to
the
gods
of
this
land
how
will
they
heed
me
who
am
an
alien
at
this
point
in
his
meditation
the
lad
flung
himself
down
in
the
shadow
of
an
archway
his
eyes
following
idly
the
darting
flight
of
the
sparrows
overhead
something
in
their
noisy
crying
brought
back
the
memory
of
the
day
when
he
bent
half
distracted
over
the
unconscious
form
of
anat
there
is
a
god
who
can
hear
somewhere
he
said
half
aloud
for
he
both
heard
and
answered
the
man
who
healed
anat
yet
is
it
a
great
thing
to
heal
blindness
i
dare
not
ask
him
to
help
me
find
a
beast
of
burden
is
there
not
some
smaller
god
who
cares
for
common
things
not
a
sparrow
falleth
to
the
ground
without
your
where
had
he
heard
those
words
it
was
john
who
had
spoken
them
after
the
scourging
before
the
council
that
means
his
father
not
mine
he
went
on
meditatively
i
am
not
a
jew
yet
are
there
sparrows
in
egypt
also
if
i
pray
to
this
god
he
will
not
i
suppose
strike
me
dead
i
will
try
and
see
what
comes
of
it
god
of
this
land
jesus
if
that
be
thy
name
i
am
as
thou
seest
an
egyptian
and
i
know
not
what
offering
is
pleasing
unto
thee
and
if
i
knew
i
could
not
provide
it
for
i
am
poorer
than
yonder
sparrow
yet
if
it
be
true
that
thou
dost
care
for
such
help
me
also
i
pray
thee
to
find
the
white
dromedary
which
is
justly
required
at
my
hands
by
the
lord
of
the
desert
when
he
had
prayed
thus
a
vague
comfort
stole
into
his
heart
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looking
down
the
street
saw
coming
toward
him
two
men
one
of
them
he
instantly
recognized
as
the
man
in
whose
keeping
he
had
left
the
dromedary
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
he
started
to
his
feet
but
shrank
back
again
into
the
archway
and
seeing
a
broken
place
in
the
wall
he
squeezed
himself
into
it
and
stood
motionless
i
will
follow
after
them
when
they
have
passed
by
he
thought
within
himself
it
may
be
that
so
i
shall
come
upon
the
beast
unawares
if
he
sees
me
it
will
not
come
to
pass
but
the
two
paused
beneath
the
archway
and
finally
sat
down
on
the
stones
neither
of
them
noticing
the
motionless
figure
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
broken
wall
give
me
thy
flask
if
thou
hast
in
it
a
swallow
of
wine
i
am
parched
with
the
heat
said
the
one
who
was
called
gestas
i
have
no
wine
replied
the
other
water
is
better
pah
grunted
gestas
testily
motioning
away
the
proffered
flask
i
do
not
drink
water
tis
fit
only
for
the
beasts
thou
art
assuredly
right
good
friend
the
best
of
the
wine
is
not
too
good
for
thee
do
but
a
trifling
service
for
me
and
thou
shalt
not
lack
for
the
necessary
gold
what
wouldst
thou
the
jew
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
if
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
proceed
seth
cautiously
peered
out
from
his
hidden
nook
he
saw
that
the
man
was
well
dressed
and
had
moreover
an
air
of
importance
he
listened
eagerly
for
his
next
words
thou
art
the
man
who
witnessed
before
pilate
against
the
malefactors
dumachus
and
titus
who
afterward
suffered
with
the
nazarene
gestas
started
visibly
he
drew
away
a
little
and
fixed
his
small
twinkling
eyes
on
his
companion
with
a
mixture
of
bravado
and
apprehension
what
if
i
be
he
said
at
length
i
was
discharged
by
the
governor
with
but
twenty
stripes
ay
but
since
then
thou
hast
also
here
the
speaker
lowered
his
voice
so
that
seth
lost
what
followed
gestas
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
great
oath
and
half
drew
his
knife
thou
knowest
too
much
by
half
he
cried
i
am
minded
to
send
thee
where
thou
mayest
prate
of
this
to
the
shades
peace
braggart
said
his
companion
a
shade
of
contempt
in
his
voice
i
am
not
unarmed
but
thou
canst
see
that
had
i
spoken
the
word
thou
wouldst
even
now
be
rotting
without
the
walls
i
did
not
choose
because
thou
canst
serve
me
sit
down
and
listen
gestas
obeyed
it
is
murder
i
suppose
he
said
sullenly
i
know
you
all
you
rich
men
you
force
us
poor
devils
to
accomplish
your
black
deeds
and
dole
out
to
us
a
scanty
pittance
from
your
hoarded
gold
but
if
there
be
other
recompense
such
as
the
scourge
or
the
cross
it
is
ours
without
grudging
thirty
pieces
of
silver
they
paid
for
the
nazarene
i
know
for
i
saw
it
what
if
it
be
thirty
pieces
of
gold
this
time
said
the
jew
softly
the
iscariot
was
an
ignorant
galilean
he
was
satisfied
with
the
silver
it
was
enough
he
added
with
a
shrug
for
he
hanged
himself
immediately
thereafter
because
of
his
remorse
now
thou
wouldst
not
do
that
i
dare
venture
i
never
else
i
had
been
dead
a
score
of
times
already
but
the
matter
in
hand
what
is
it
i
make
no
bargain
understand
till
i
know
tis
simple
enough
and
safe
only
the
disposal
of
a
man
without
family
and
yes
without
friends
he
is
moreover
his
removal
is
therefore
lawful
why
then
dost
thou
why
do
i
not
perform
the
deed
myself
a
proper
question
thou
hast
understanding
it
is
most
sapient
gestas
not
my
affair
i
represent
another
that
other
is
not
in
a
position
to
avenge
himself
personally
nevertheless
he
will
be
avenged
wilt
thou
undertake
this
for
thirty
pieces
of
gold
ten
pieces
now
thirty
afterward
and
i
will
do
it
say
five
now
nay
ten
i
have
no
mind
to
risk
my
life
for
a
pittance
the
other
produced
his
wallet
albeit
with
some
show
of
reluctance
and
passed
it
into
the
hand
of
gestas
there
are
just
ten
pieces
within
he
remarked
thou
mayest
count
them
gestas
fumbled
over
the
coins
deliberately
counting
them
in
a
sibilant
whisper
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
yes
ten
and
a
bit
of
silver
then
he
lifted
the
pouch
to
the
light
and
looked
at
it
critically
i
will
keep
this
also
and
the
silver
he
added
with
a
knowing
leer
of
course
keep
that
also
said
his
companion
eying
him
with
an
inscrutable
smile
but
i
have
not
told
thee
the
man
s
name
his
head
must
thou
deliver
to
me
this
very
night
at
midnight
if
thou
wouldst
receive
the
thirty
pieces
it
is
known
to
me
where
thou
art
encamped
with
thy
followers
i
make
no
secret
of
that
said
gestas
with
a
boastful
laugh
there
is
good
water
for
our
beasts
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
and
it
is
not
too
far
from
the
highway
if
therefore
thou
wilt
be
in
waiting
just
without
the
jaffa
gate
the
head
shall
be
delivered
into
thy
hand
at
the
hour
named
if
not
why
then
night
one
must
have
time
to
snare
the
bird
but
thou
hast
not
yet
told
me
the
name
true
well
then
listen
leaning
forward
the
jew
whispered
for
a
little
space
into
the
ear
of
gestas
who
nodded
twice
or
thrice
as
if
he
understood
i
know
the
man
he
said
no
one
better
he
should
by
right
be
about
another
business
then
he
laughed
aloud
as
if
something
afforded
him
much
secret
amusement
i
have
done
for
the
father
i
am
once
avenged
now
i
will
be
twice
avenged
which
is
better
i
know
also
how
to
lure
him
into
a
safe
place
thou
wilt
not
fail
with
the
thirty
pieces
i
swear
by
the
temple
that
i
will
not
fail
good
now
there
is
another
matter
i
have
in
my
camp
a
dromedary
of
great
swiftness
which
i
wish
to
dispose
of
at
a
fair
price
the
animal
is
young
docile
well
trained
it
is
moreover
of
a
white
color
i
have
never
seen
the
like
i
bought
the
beast
of
a
caravan
and
paid
for
it
a
great
sum
no
doubt
replied
his
companion
suavely
but
let
us
first
finish
the
matter
in
hand
one
thing
at
a
time
and
diligently
done
maketh
a
well
ordered
life
he
continued
piously
so
then
i
leave
the
affair
in
thy
hands
thou
mayest
trust
me
cried
gestas
with
a
great
laugh
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
brought
down
his
broad
palm
on
the
other
man
s
shoulder
with
a
sounding
thwack
thou
hast
made
no
mistake
in
putting
the
matter
into
my
hands
it
will
here
he
stopped
short
and
stared
fixedly
into
the
shadow
of
the
arch
body
of
jove
he
exclaimed
it
seems
that
we
are
not
alone
and
reaching
forward
he
grasped
the
wretched
seth
by
the
shoulder
and
dragged
him
forth
into
the
sunlight
what
wast
thou
doing
there
thou
devil
s
imp
nay
but
thou
shalt
answer
dearly
for
this
but
seth
had
not
shifted
for
himself
all
his
thirteen
years
of
life
for
naught
he
instantly
perceived
that
the
man
did
not
recognize
him
rubbing
his
eyes
stupidly
he
stammered
out
something
about
sleeping
soundly
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
the
jew
who
was
regarding
him
suspiciously
from
under
his
bent
brows
and
whined
out
a
petition
for
alms
wilt
thou
that
i
give
thee
a
gold
piece
said
gestas
in
the
greek
tongue
seth
regarded
him
blankly
i
do
not
understand
honored
sir
he
said
humbly
the
companion
of
gestas
looked
relieved
it
is
safe
enough
if
the
beggar
understood
us
not
he
said
best
take
him
along
with
you
and
make
him
secure
till
afterward
then
release
him
it
may
be
that
he
doth
not
understand
rejoined
gestas
staring
fixedly
at
the
lad
with
his
fierce
red
eyes
yet
there
is
but
one
kind
of
a
man
who
can
be
trusted
to
tell
no
tales
and
that
is
a
dead
man
all
languages
are
alike
to
the
tongue
that
hath
ceased
to
move
any
other
tongue
is
to
be
feared
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
ah
well
do
with
him
as
thou
wilt
life
can
be
nothing
to
such
as
he
only
take
him
away
till
the
hour
and
place
of
our
agreement
farewell
and
turning
he
walked
rapidly
away
without
once
looking
behind
him
for
an
instant
seth
meditated
flight
but
the
burly
figure
of
gestas
was
planted
directly
in
front
of
him
to
elude
him
would
be
impossible
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
the
brown
head
and
bright
eyes
of
a
sparrow
perched
securely
upon
the
ledge
of
the
arch
above
him
the
little
creature
was
regarding
the
scene
with
apparent
curiosity
presently
with
a
wild
cry
it
darted
away
to
join
its
fellows
the
lad
followed
its
flight
with
envious
eyes
and
for
the
second
time
he
remembered
the
strange
words
of
john
not
a
sparrow
falleth
to
the
ground
without
your
father
again
he
prayed
to
the
unknown
god
who
minded
even
the
little
wild
things
of
the
air
and
as
before
he
was
comforted
gestas
was
evidently
considering
the
situation
with
care
for
he
continued
to
stand
silent
before
his
prisoner
his
arms
akimbo
his
small
savage
eyes
riveted
upon
the
figure
before
him
wouldst
thou
that
i
release
thee
he
asked
suddenly
in
the
greek
tongue
if
it
please
thee
good
sir
responded
seth
quite
off
his
guard
gestas
smiled
evilly
it
doth
not
please
me
boy
now
march
before
me
so
remember
that
i
have
in
my
hand
a
knife
and
grasping
the
boy
by
the
shoulders
he
shoved
him
with
a
kind
of
terrible
gentleness
into
the
street
like
one
in
a
dream
the
lad
walked
before
his
captor
from
time
to
time
he
looked
wildly
about
in
the
vain
hope
of
rescue
but
the
few
went
about
their
business
with
unseeing
eyes
and
an
occasional
prick
of
the
knife
from
behind
warned
him
that
instant
death
awaited
him
should
he
venture
to
cry
out
at
length
they
had
passed
quite
out
of
the
city
here
gestas
paused
for
a
moment
and
seeing
that
no
one
was
by
he
proceeded
to
bind
the
lad
s
hands
securely
behind
his
back
thou
art
such
a
proper
liar
he
remarked
with
a
grin
that
i
am
minded
to
leave
thee
alive
for
a
while
longer
seth
made
no
reply
nor
did
he
cry
out
when
gestas
playfully
thrust
the
knife
within
a
hair
s
breadth
of
his
throat
if
i
must
die
he
thought
i
will
at
least
die
like
a
man
then
he
remembered
anat
sitting
happily
at
her
spinning
at
the
feet
of
the
gentle
mary
the
tears
rose
to
his
eyes
and
brimming
over
rolled
in
great
drops
down
his
brown
cheeks
he
shook
them
off
valiantly
tears
do
not
become
a
man
he
said
to
himself
sternly
come
come
my
lad
cried
gestas
my
business
requireth
haste
as
well
as
diligence
we
must
be
getting
on
then
feeling
very
merry
indeed
he
put
up
his
knife
and
fetched
out
his
pouch
shaking
it
so
that
all
the
gold
pieces
within
clinked
musically
he
strode
along
chanting
a
pagan
rhyme
of
bacchus
and
the
pleasures
of
the
vine
after
a
time
they
reached
one
of
the
narrow
denies
which
wind
between
the
hills
on
either
side
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
and
here
they
presently
came
upon
the
encampment
cunningly
placed
within
a
copse
of
trees
on
the
edge
of
a
stream
half
a
score
of
men
were
scattered
about
upon
the
greensward
some
of
them
eating
and
drinking
others
playing
at
dice
and
others
still
stretched
out
at
full
length
in
the
shade
asleep
the
arrival
of
gestas
and
his
prisoner
was
greeted
with
a
shout
of
laughter
ha
our
worthy
chief
hath
made
a
notable
capture
cried
one
sauntering
up
to
seth
and
looking
down
at
him
a
mighty
man
of
valor
is
he
truly
to
accomplish
the
overthrow
of
such
as
this
how
many
bags
of
gold
didst
thou
take
from
him
gestas
winked
significantly
i
shall
take
three
if
the
gods
prosper
me
he
replied
then
he
bound
the
lad
s
ankles
together
and
bidding
the
man
keep
an
eye
upon
the
prisoner
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
ground
and
demanded
food
and
drink
two
or
three
others
gathered
about
him
and
to
these
he
talked
rapidly
in
low
tones
as
he
ate
but
nothing
of
what
was
being
said
reached
the
ears
of
seth
who
was
beginning
to
suffer
intense
agony
from
the
tightness
of
the
cords
with
which
his
wrists
and
ankles
were
bound
he
ventured
at
length
to
speak
of
this
to
the
man
who
had
been
detailed
to
watch
him
his
guard
loosened
the
bonds
then
relapsed
into
a
doze
which
presently
deepened
into
a
heavy
sleep
as
the
hours
crept
slowly
by
seth
worked
cautiously
and
unceasingly
to
loosen
further
the
cords
at
his
wrists
towards
evening
he
found
to
his
intense
joy
that
his
hands
were
free
no
one
noticed
him
the
man
at
his
feet
still
slept
heavily
and
after
awhile
he
ventured
stealthily
to
undo
the
thongs
which
bound
his
feet
together
then
he
sat
motionless
not
daring
to
stir
till
the
shadows
should
deepen
as
evening
drew
on
gestas
accompanied
by
two
of
the
other
men
left
the
camp
he
cast
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
lad
as
he
passed
by
him
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
minded
to
examine
his
bonds
but
finally
went
his
way
no
sooner
had
he
disappeared
than
the
lad
crept
away
among
the
trees
and
bushes
before
many
minutes
he
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
thicket
here
he
paused
breathlessly
to
listen
then
rising
to
his
feet
ran
like
the
wind
in
the
direction
of
the
city
i
must
find
ben
hesed
he
said
he
will
know
what
to
do
chapter
xx
without
the
jaffa
gate
the
sunset
hour
was
always
a
time
of
peace
and
peculiar
joy
in
the
house
of
john
the
toils
and
dangers
of
the
day
being
well
over
the
family
were
wont
to
gather
upon
the
housetop
there
to
talk
over
what
had
happened
during
the
hours
that
were
passed
the
golden
glories
of
the
dying
day
served
to
bring
to
their
minds
each
recurring
evening
that
place
beyond
the
toils
and
sorrows
of
earth
which
their
lord
had
gone
to
prepare
and
toward
which
each
day
s
journey
was
swiftly
hurrying
them
here
the
mother
of
jesus
sat
enshrined
in
saintly
peace
here
also
were
john
and
peter
with
the
other
apostles
anna
the
wife
of
caiaphas
stephen
and
of
late
the
egyptian
maiden
together
with
many
others
who
came
to
them
for
help
instruction
or
healing
the
number
of
such
homes
was
daily
increasing
in
jerusalem
yet
it
was
at
this
door
perhaps
more
often
than
at
any
other
that
wretched
humanity
knocked
for
admittance
and
admittance
was
always
granted
for
to
these
had
been
committed
the
ministry
of
the
ascended
christ
with
all
that
this
signified
of
power
and
of
blessing
into
their
midst
came
ben
hesed
to
talk
once
more
with
the
apostles
concerning
the
crucified
one
he
brought
with
him
the
scrolls
of
the
prophecies
for
he
was
troubled
about
certain
points
therein
how
is
it
he
said
that
it
is
written
accursed
be
every
one
that
hangeth
upon
the
tree
surely
god
s
anointed
could
not
be
accursed
dost
thou
doubt
concerning
him
already
asked
peter
sternly
nay
i
doubt
not
man
my
spirit
witnesseth
within
me
that
the
thing
is
true
but
i
would
fain
be
able
to
speak
convincingly
to
them
which
believe
not
when
i
shall
have
returned
into
the
wilderness
it
is
not
granted
to
every
one
to
behold
the
angel
of
deliverance
thou
hast
spoken
wisely
who
art
wise
said
john
gently
the
young
man
stephen
doth
without
ceasing
make
study
of
that
which
hath
been
written
aforetime
concerning
the
christ
yea
the
spirit
also
hath
revealed
to
him
many
things
which
have
been
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
wise
and
this
to
our
profit
who
are
sorely
beset
with
the
duties
of
our
ministry
read
i
beseech
thee
my
brother
from
the
scroll
which
thou
hast
prepared
concerning
him
which
hath
been
hanged
it
is
written
in
the
law
thus
said
stephen
who
a
little
apart
from
the
others
had
been
poring
in
silence
over
a
number
of
parchments
if
a
man
have
committed
a
sin
worthy
of
death
and
he
be
put
to
death
and
thou
hang
him
upon
a
tree
his
body
shall
not
remain
all
night
upon
the
tree
but
thou
shalt
surely
bury
him
that
day
for
he
that
is
hanged
is
accursed
of
god
that
thy
land
be
not
defiled
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
an
but
and
if
a
sinless
and
holy
man
be
put
to
death
by
false
accusation
how
is
it
that
he
is
accursed
herein
is
a
great
mystery
which
as
yet
we
see
only
in
part
nor
indeed
can
it
be
apprehended
of
mortals
that
god
gave
his
only
begotten
son
not
only
that
he
should
live
amongst
us
a
holy
and
sinless
life
but
that
he
should
yield
up
that
life
in
all
meekness
at
the
hands
of
his
enemies
this
also
being
the
will
of
the
father
concerning
him
as
he
himself
said
and
as
the
voice
of
many
prophets
declare
who
being
dead
yet
speak
to
us
in
the
words
of
the
scripture
are
we
not
every
one
accursed
for
we
have
sinned
in
the
sight
of
god
and
he
the
sinless
one
hath
through
the
infinite
compassion
of
the
father
become
accursed
in
our
place
even
as
it
is
written
by
the
hand
of
the
prophet
isaiah
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
and
behold
these
sayings
i
gave
my
back
to
the
smiters
and
my
cheeks
to
them
that
plucked
off
the
hair
i
hid
not
my
face
from
shame
and
from
spitting
the
assembly
of
the
wicked
have
closed
in
upon
me
they
pierced
my
hands
and
my
feet
they
parted
my
garments
among
them
and
cast
lots
upon
my
vesture
they
gave
me
also
gall
for
my
meat
and
in
my
thirst
they
gave
me
vinegar
to
drink
i
became
a
reproach
unto
them
when
they
looked
upon
me
they
wagged
their
and
this
his
visage
was
so
marred
more
than
any
man
and
his
form
more
than
the
sons
of
men
he
was
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him
he
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
for
the
transgression
of
my
people
was
he
stricken
and
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
rich
in
his
all
these
sayings
i
found
concerning
him
continued
the
young
man
gravely
written
many
generations
before
his
birth
they
might
have
been
writ
yesterday
by
one
who
witnessed
his
death
also
by
the
hand
of
the
prophet
daniel
is
this
and
after
three
score
and
two
weeks
shall
messiah
be
cut
off
but
not
for
himself
and
the
people
of
the
prince
that
shall
come
shall
destroy
the
city
and
the
sanctuary
and
the
end
thereof
shall
be
as
a
flood
and
unto
the
end
of
the
war
desolations
are
the
end
is
yet
to
come
said
ben
hesed
involuntarily
clenching
his
strong
hands
and
looking
toward
the
walls
of
the
mighty
temple
which
shone
white
and
mystical
in
the
soft
light
of
the
rising
moon
he
himself
foretold
all
that
hath
happened
said
john
sorrowfully
and
what
is
yet
to
come
how
that
he
should
be
delivered
up
to
the
romans
and
should
be
mocked
and
spitefully
entreated
spitted
upon
scourged
and
crucified
it
lay
heavily
upon
him
so
that
even
he
who
walked
ever
in
the
light
of
god
was
exceeding
sorrowful
and
when
he
looked
to
us
for
sympathy
that
last
awful
night
we
slept
god
forgive
us
he
hath
forgiven
us
all
things
said
peter
he
bore
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree
for
the
love
of
him
shall
we
not
gladly
suffer
what
shall
yet
befall
us
for
he
told
us
plainly
that
the
world
would
hate
us
even
as
it
hated
him
that
we
also
should
be
persecuted
scourged
and
put
to
death
yet
how
soon
will
all
be
past
and
then
we
shall
go
to
him
in
the
silence
which
followed
these
words
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
at
the
outer
gate
of
the
courtyard
stephen
arose
quietly
from
his
place
and
descended
the
stair
when
he
had
opened
the
door
he
saw
standing
in
the
street
a
man
he
was
meanly
clad
as
stephen
could
see
by
the
dim
light
therefore
his
voice
was
more
gentle
than
usual
as
he
said
what
wilt
thou
friend
is
there
here
a
young
man
called
stephen
i
am
he
wilt
thou
enter
the
man
shuffled
uneasily
on
his
feet
then
looked
furtively
up
and
down
the
street
there
be
a
sick
man
who
hath
need
of
thee
for
healing
and
strong
words
of
thy
faith
he
said
at
length
fixing
his
eyes
upon
stephen
wouldst
thou
not
rather
inquire
for
one
of
the
twelve
nay
it
was
for
one
stephen
a
greek
i
was
bidden
to
ask
the
man
i
have
spoken
of
is
also
a
greek
and
would
not
ask
for
healing
at
the
hands
of
a
jew
the
healing
cometh
from
god
said
stephen
gravely
i
will
come
though
where
is
the
sick
man
i
will
show
thee
where
he
lieth
said
the
man
eagerly
and
i
pray
thee
to
make
haste
for
his
case
is
desperate
let
me
first
speak
to
them
that
are
within
i
will
join
thee
immediately
said
stephen
stepping
back
into
the
courtyard
and
leaving
the
door
partly
open
the
man
listened
to
the
sound
of
his
retreating
steps
as
he
ascended
the
stair
they
be
all
above
he
muttered
stepping
softly
within
now
if
by
any
chance
ha
what
is
this
a
capital
warm
cloak
twill
serve
to
shelter
me
these
chill
nights
body
of
jove
but
i
am
always
in
luck
of
late
when
stephen
returned
the
man
was
waiting
humbly
without
as
he
had
left
him
the
two
immediately
set
forth
the
man
going
before
they
walked
swiftly
through
the
dark
narrow
streets
the
stranger
glancing
frequently
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
stephen
was
following
after
a
time
he
paused
tis
without
the
walls
he
muttered
hoarsely
we
must
pass
through
the
jaffa
gate
there
is
moonlight
said
stephen
rather
absently
raising
his
eyes
to
the
heavens
where
in
truth
his
thoughts
had
been
as
he
followed
his
strange
guide
there
is
moonlight
repeated
the
man
with
a
hoarse
chuckle
so
much
the
better
stephen
looked
at
the
speaker
more
attentively
than
he
had
done
at
first
the
white
light
which
poured
down
from
above
revealing
clearly
every
feature
of
the
brutal
face
before
him
he
started
visibly
i
have
somewhere
seen
thee
before
he
exclaimed
nay
i
know
now
thou
art
of
them
who
formerly
the
man
laughed
aloud
i
am
gestas
second
in
authority
to
dumachus
who
was
chief
of
our
band
and
your
father
since
the
romans
put
an
end
to
him
along
with
titus
and
the
nazarene
i
have
been
chief
and
is
it
one
of
your
followers
who
is
in
need
of
healing
asked
stephen
shrinking
back
a
little
with
something
of
his
dread
it
is
art
thou
afraid
no
returned
stephen
quietly
i
am
not
afraid
surely
of
all
men
ye
are
most
in
need
of
the
mighty
help
of
the
risen
lord
twere
most
fitting
if
so
be
that
i
may
bring
it
into
your
midst
gestas
looked
at
him
with
an
indescribable
mixture
of
contempt
and
pity
thou
art
a
pretty
enough
fellow
he
said
running
his
eyes
over
the
slender
but
figure
a
thought
too
pretty
indeed
why
art
thou
contented
to
pass
thy
days
in
the
company
of
a
band
of
crazy
fools
who
will
end
as
their
master
did
though
he
merited
it
not
on
the
cross
why
take
the
devil
s
wages
without
the
devil
s
pleasures
first
if
now
i
die
on
the
cross
it
will
be
for
reasons
better
than
preaching
praying
and
the
healing
of
dirty
beggar
folk
afterward
is
the
judgment
said
stephen
a
fig
for
the
afterwards
cried
gestas
who
knows
anything
about
that
but
come
he
added
with
a
sudden
change
in
his
tones
it
lacks
but
an
hour
of
midnight
thou
must
be
gone
before
that
time
i
am
not
in
haste
to
be
gone
said
stephen
gently
i
will
remain
until
morning
if
i
can
do
anything
to
help
there
is
naught
that
thou
canst
do
after
midnight
said
gestas
gruffly
if
there
is
an
afterwards
he
muttered
it
will
make
no
difference
to
him
the
two
walked
silently
for
a
time
pausing
at
length
at
the
edge
of
a
coppice
through
the
interlacing
branches
of
which
could
be
seen
the
fitful
flash
of
a
dying
fire
making
their
way
through
the
thicket
by
a
winding
path
evidently
well
known
to
gestas
the
twain
presently
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
the
encampment
where
is
the
dying
man
said
stephen
eager
to
begin
his
ministry
of
love
for
answer
gestas
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
hurried
him
forward
into
the
midst
of
a
dark
group
of
figures
which
seemed
to
be
awaiting
their
approach
thou
art
the
dying
man
he
whispered
hoarsely
prepare
for
thy
afterwards
swiftly
half
involuntarily
stephen
made
a
mighty
unavailing
effort
to
free
himself
from
the
grasp
of
the
ruffian
who
held
him
life
on
a
sudden
looked
very
sweet
to
him
it
could
not
be
that
god
had
appointed
such
an
end
as
this
for
one
who
would
serve
him
long
and
faithfully
surely
he
was
too
young
to
die
yet
not
younger
than
titus
who
had
gone
by
the
horrible
way
of
the
cross
to
be
with
him
in
paradise
at
the
thought
a
great
peace
possessed
his
soul
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
he
murmured
aloud
raising
his
eyes
to
the
stars
which
glittered
keenly
through
the
interlacing
branches
overhead
so
this
is
the
man
cried
a
rough
voice
as
a
dozen
hands
bound
him
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
it
may
be
that
if
he
hath
the
power
to
heal
as
they
say
he
will
be
master
also
of
other
magic
arts
which
he
will
use
to
our
undoing
best
make
way
with
him
quickly
stephen
looked
about
on
the
crowd
of
evil
faces
which
surrounded
him
and
a
great
wave
of
pity
for
his
tormentors
swept
over
him
so
far
were
they
from
god
so
deep
in
unfathomable
depths
of
misery
for
himself
he
felt
no
fear
from
earth
to
heaven
was
but
a
single
step
men
and
brethren
he
cried
and
his
voice
rang
out
clear
and
sweet
upon
the
startled
air
let
me
live
for
yet
a
little
space
till
i
shall
declare
unto
you
the
words
of
life
for
such
as
you
jesus
died
upon
the
cross
he
will
save
you
from
out
the
misery
of
this
present
life
and
afterward
give
you
the
life
that
endeth
not
only
believe
on
him
and
forsake
your
evil
ways
prate
not
to
us
of
thy
jewish
messiah
cried
one
he
is
not
for
us
even
if
what
thou
sayest
be
true
we
must
die
as
we
have
lived
we
be
uncircumcised
greeks
that
care
not
for
an
everlasting
abode
with
them
that
spit
upon
us
in
this
life
nay
but
he
died
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
he
is
risen
from
death
to
abide
forever
with
the
father
which
made
the
greek
as
well
as
the
jew
and
loveth
both
alike
give
to
us
a
sign
cried
another
if
what
thou
hast
said
be
true
let
the
man
jesus
come
down
out
of
the
heavens
and
deliver
thee
then
will
we
believe
on
him
nay
more
thou
shalt
be
our
leader
in
place
of
gestas
here
who
is
too
stupid
to
be
chief
at
this
gestas
swore
a
great
oath
of
rage
stand
back
all
of
you
he
cried
i
will
smite
him
and
there
is
none
that
shall
deliver
him
out
of
my
hand
either
on
earth
or
in
heaven
then
he
raised
his
arm
stephen
caught
the
keen
glitter
of
the
steel
he
closed
his
eyes
his
lips
moved
in
prayer
something
smote
him
on
the
breast
but
it
was
not
the
blade
as
he
dimly
realized
ere
his
senses
left
him
gestas
stricken
full
in
the
heart
by
an
arrow
sped
from
the
bow
of
an
unseen
archer
had
leapt
straight
into
the
air
without
a
cry
then
falling
limply
his
head
striking
against
the
prisoner
he
lay
a
grim
unsightly
heap
at
stephen
s
feet
the
others
stood
for
an
instant
aghast
then
with
wild
cries
of
fear
they
fled
away
into
the
thicket
i
fear
the
knaves
have
done
for
him
whoever
he
be
cried
a
voice
as
the
figure
of
a
young
man
bounded
out
of
the
bushes
nay
my
son
said
ben
hesed
who
had
followed
more
deliberately
the
miscreant
had
but
raised
his
blade
when
my
arrow
smote
him
let
us
loose
the
man
here
and
get
away
from
this
place
with
all
speed
for
they
will
return
and
fall
upon
us
if
they
find
that
we
be
few
i
must
fetch
the
white
dromedary
said
the
voice
of
seth
at
his
elbow
it
is
in
yonder
glade
be
quick
then
there
is
no
time
to
lose
the
moon
had
looked
down
for
a
full
hour
longer
upon
the
dark
motionless
something
which
lay
just
where
it
had
fallen
on
the
soft
grass
when
the
thicket
again
opened
and
a
man
peered
out
he
looked
about
him
cautiously
then
turned
and
spoke
reassuringly
to
some
one
behind
him
there
is
no
one
here
joca
come
on
it
was
a
bolt
from
heaven
assuredly
which
smote
him
for
there
is
naught
missing
save
the
man
said
the
other
looking
keenly
about
in
his
turn
at
the
familiar
scene
let
us
get
away
from
this
place
i
am
sick
of
it
ay
we
will
return
to
greece
where
the
old
gods
yet
rule
i
like
not
the
ways
of
the
god
of
this
land
but
first
and
the
speaker
cautiously
approached
the
body
of
gestas
he
hath
something
about
him
which
we
shall
have
more
need
of
than
he
ah
here
it
is
ten
good
pieces
if
he
have
not
already
spent
some
of
them
but
there
were
to
have
been
thirty
pieces
more
ay
and
more
s
the
pity
that
they
be
lost
to
us
why
need
they
be
lost
to
us
man
what
meanest
thou
joca
whispered
something
in
his
companion
s
ear
whereat
the
other
chuckled
hoarsely
why
not
he
cried
thou
art
a
son
of
minerva
to
have
thought
it
the
servant
of
annas
had
waited
outside
the
jaffa
gate
for
nearly
two
hours
he
was
growing
impatient
at
last
i
will
not
stay
longer
he
muttered
something
hath
miscarried
in
the
matter
it
will
be
if
the
knave
hath
not
failed
me
altogether
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
saw
a
man
approaching
him
he
at
once
stood
forth
in
the
full
moonlight
bidding
his
companions
remain
within
the
shadow
of
the
wall
the
man
came
up
to
him
swiftly
art
thou
he
who
hath
thirty
pieces
of
gold
to
give
in
exchange
for
a
strange
commodity
i
am
he
hast
thou
the
commodity
ay
it
is
here
wilt
thou
see
it
the
jew
shuddered
at
sight
of
the
bag
which
the
other
tendered
him
no
he
said
shortly
take
the
money
and
be
gone
then
he
turned
to
one
of
the
slaves
who
waited
his
orders
take
this
he
commanded
and
fetch
it
to
the
palace
chapter
xxi
not
a
sparrow
falleth
something
more
than
two
years
after
the
events
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapter
a
little
group
of
men
might
have
been
seen
standing
in
the
portico
of
a
building
known
as
the
synagogue
of
the
nazarenes
they
were
conversing
in
low
tones
but
their
excited
gestures
and
gloomy
faces
betrayed
the
fact
that
the
topic
which
they
were
discussing
was
not
a
pleasant
one
there
is
unquestioned
and
open
partiality
on
the
part
of
the
apostles
toward
them
that
be
of
hebrew
birth
and
descent
said
one
bitterly
though
we
be
circumcised
and
walk
after
the
law
in
all
diligence
the
fact
that
we
are
greeks
can
be
neither
overlooked
nor
forgiven
i
mind
not
what
they
think
cried
another
sturdily
a
greek
is
as
good
as
a
jew
any
day
and
we
be
all
servants
of
one
master
even
christ
but
it
is
not
just
that
our
widows
and
fatherless
be
neglected
in
the
daily
distributions
for
we
have
all
given
freely
of
our
substance
into
the
common
fund
i
like
not
to
boast
my
andronicus
said
the
third
man
almost
in
a
whisper
but
i
can
not
forbear
the
thought
that
had
i
retained
in
mine
own
power
what
i
aforetime
laid
down
at
the
apostles
feet
freely
and
in
all
humility
of
mind
these
tales
of
neglect
would
not
now
be
coming
to
our
ears
none
of
the
three
had
observed
that
a
fourth
man
had
joined
himself
to
the
group
till
the
newcomer
spoke
the
neglect
of
which
thou
dost
complain
my
brothers
he
said
in
a
deep
musical
voice
is
not
a
neglect
born
of
contempt
for
us
because
we
are
greeks
i
know
these
men
through
and
through
they
rest
not
day
nor
night
but
labor
incessantly
and
in
all
unselfishness
and
love
for
the
church
yet
is
the
burden
too
heavy
for
them
christ
healed
many
that
were
sick
and
fed
many
that
were
hungry
yet
there
remain
multitudes
of
them
that
are
blind
of
them
that
are
lepers
of
them
that
hunger
who
were
also
blind
leprous
and
hungry
when
our
master
walked
the
earth
they
came
not
unto
him
and
how
could
he
succor
them
being
burdened
with
this
humanity
which
doth
irk
us
all
what
thou
hast
said
my
stephen
is
true
admitted
andronicus
but
it
is
also
true
that
among
the
jewish
widows
there
is
no
lack
while
priscilla
and
her
little
ones
remained
two
days
without
food
had
she
refrained
from
joining
herself
to
us
she
would
have
continued
to
receive
aid
from
the
temple
treasury
the
woman
herself
declared
it
and
i
could
not
gainsay
her
had
i
wished
it
if
there
be
not
neglect
born
of
contempt
there
is
assuredly
a
lack
of
wisdom
what
hath
been
done
for
priscilla
my
wife
ministered
to
her
necessities
as
well
as
to
those
of
julia
and
eunice
hast
thou
spoken
of
this
to
peter
asked
stephen
looking
troubled
and
turning
to
one
of
the
others
nay
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
there
should
be
no
need
to
speak
say
i
forget
not
the
word
of
the
master
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
said
stephen
gravely
we
must
look
carefully
within
before
we
lightly
censure
any
man
least
of
all
the
chosen
and
anointed
ones
of
our
lord
then
after
a
thoughtful
pause
he
added
i
will
myself
speak
with
john
concerning
these
things
the
man
who
had
first
spoken
and
who
was
called
apelles
looked
after
him
as
he
walked
away
from
him
i
can
suffer
reproof
as
from
no
other
he
said
he
hath
within
him
the
very
spirit
of
the
ascended
one
like
the
ascended
one
he
hath
also
enemies
in
high
places
said
andronicus
significantly
the
continued
attempts
made
upon
his
life
bear
witness
to
the
fact
what
dost
thou
mean
he
was
threatened
it
is
true
by
certain
of
the
sadducees
because
of
his
boldness
in
declaring
the
resurrection
in
their
very
midst
but
no
man
laid
hands
on
him
the
herodians
and
especially
the
pharisee
from
tarsus
are
bitter
against
him
for
some
reason
which
perhaps
we
understand
not
wholly
hast
thou
forgotten
his
rescue
by
ben
hesed
more
than
two
years
ago
and
also
what
happened
thrice
since
when
by
the
barest
chance
he
escaped
with
his
life
true
he
has
been
mercifully
preserved
amidst
great
dangers
but
each
time
there
was
a
simple
enough
cause
for
the
peril
without
attributing
it
to
an
enemy
said
apelles
thoughtfully
once
it
was
from
robbers
who
would
have
slain
him
from
the
mere
lust
of
murder
as
is
their
wont
again
a
heavy
stone
fell
from
the
wall
above
as
he
spake
to
the
people
barely
missing
his
head
in
its
descent
yes
i
know
all
that
thou
wouldst
say
broke
in
the
other
but
listen
yesterday
a
basket
of
fruit
was
sent
him
bearing
a
scroll
inscribed
thus
this
fruit
is
for
the
saintly
stephen
from
one
who
believes
that
the
apples
of
paradise
are
none
too
fair
for
such
as
a
pretty
conceit
assuredly
a
most
lovely
conceit
had
he
eaten
as
the
sender
supposed
that
he
would
do
even
now
would
the
apples
of
paradise
be
within
his
grasp
what
meanest
thou
i
will
not
eat
of
this
fair
fruit
said
stephen
instead
i
will
bear
it
to
the
aged
clement
who
hath
only
of
late
joined
himself
to
us
but
while
he
waited
for
a
convenient
season
for
taking
the
gift
the
fruit
stood
without
on
the
ledge
of
the
window
and
the
birds
came
and
pecked
it
before
they
could
fly
away
after
their
stolen
meal
the
little
creatures
dropped
dead
horror
the
fruit
was
poisoned
then
assuredly
now
thou
seest
that
he
hath
an
enemy
but
who
i
have
my
suspicions
and
have
warned
him
his
answer
was
this
he
is
with
me
alway
even
unto
the
end
until
my
appointed
time
there
is
nothing
that
shall
be
able
to
hurt
me
neither
shall
i
fear
what
man
can
do
to
wonderful
i
have
confessed
that
jesus
is
the
christ
but
i
fear
me
my
faith
in
him
is
but
a
poor
thing
compared
with
that
of
stephen
had
the
like
happened
to
me
i
should
have
fled
the
city
twas
what
i
urged
upon
him
go
away
from
jerusalem
i
said
there
be
jews
in
every
city
of
greece
who
would
gladly
hear
thee
of
the
christ
in
the
land
of
thy
fathers
shalt
thou
dwell
in
safety
but
he
shook
his
head
the
day
is
not
far
distant
he
made
answer
when
not
alone
to
the
jews
shall
this
salvation
be
preached
but
unto
every
people
and
kindred
and
tongue
beneath
the
heavens
for
christ
came
to
save
the
world
and
therefore
shall
the
world
be
saved
but
it
is
not
i
who
am
called
to
this
work
my
place
is
while
the
two
greeks
thus
spoke
one
to
another
of
stephen
the
young
man
himself
was
passing
rapidly
through
the
streets
towards
his
home
his
thoughts
busied
chiefly
with
what
andronicus
had
told
him
concerning
the
daily
ministrations
the
matter
must
be
looked
to
he
said
to
himself
the
twelve
are
not
sufficient
for
the
work
god
be
praised
so
mightily
hath
the
spirit
worked
with
and
for
us
that
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
the
cross
shall
cease
to
be
a
symbol
of
shame
and
hissing
among
men
and
shall
everywhere
be
hailed
the
sacred
token
of
deliverance
communing
thus
within
himself
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
beheld
the
square
which
lay
before
the
palace
of
pilate
it
was
here
he
murmured
that
they
brought
him
on
the
day
of
his
death
it
was
here
that
the
people
cried
out
crucify
him
crucify
him
ah
that
awful
day
nay
rather
that
day
of
days
decreed
from
the
foundations
of
the
world
then
he
passed
on
into
the
square
being
minded
to
look
for
a
moment
on
the
very
place
where
he
knew
the
man
of
sorrows
had
stood
so
patiently
on
that
last
day
of
his
earthly
life
as
he
approached
the
mosaic
of
marbles
which
marked
the
place
of
the
judgment
seat
a
roman
chariot
containing
two
men
and
drawn
by
a
pair
of
powerful
black
horses
dashed
into
the
square
dost
see
that
fellow
yonder
herod
exclaimed
the
man
who
stood
behind
the
driver
i
mean
the
one
with
the
white
robe
tis
that
beggarly
greek
stephen
who
hath
been
setting
the
city
on
an
uproar
of
late
with
his
driveling
cant
i
hate
the
whole
blasphemous
brood
but
he
is
most
contemptible
of
all
i
will
engage
to
run
him
down
if
thou
sayest
it
said
the
man
who
held
the
reins
and
across
whose
white
tunic
streamed
a
scarf
of
the
imperial
purple
be
it
so
answered
his
companion
with
a
malignant
scowl
twill
be
a
happy
accident
that
rids
the
world
of
such
an
one
an
accident
of
course
said
the
other
with
a
brutal
laugh
who
would
dare
question
it
and
he
brought
the
long
lash
with
a
whistling
curl
about
the
glossy
flanks
of
the
horses
they
leapt
forward
as
one
something
else
also
leapt
forward
there
was
a
cry
and
the
sound
of
the
iron
hoofs
was
horribly
dulled
for
an
instant
then
the
chariot
thundered
on
and
swept
into
the
avenue
beyond
the
palace
by
the
gods
alexander
cried
herod
didst
see
the
man
who
leapt
forward
from
behind
he
dragged
the
beggar
forth
just
in
time
another
instant
and
he
would
have
been
crushed
beneath
our
wheels
i
saw
yes
answered
the
other
grinding
his
teeth
the
wretch
bears
a
charmed
life
we
will
drive
back
to
inquire
of
the
accident
pursued
herod
with
a
sneering
laugh
pollux
there
struck
something
softer
than
the
pavement
hey
pollux
my
beauty
if
it
chanced
to
be
the
man
s
head
he
will
prate
no
more
of
dead
malefactors
nor
yet
of
live
ones
how
now
fellow
he
shouted
reining
in
his
struggling
horses
as
they
approached
the
borders
of
the
crowd
which
had
instantly
gathered
at
the
scene
of
the
accident
was
the
man
hurt
seriously
not
seriously
they
say
your
highness
replied
the
man
to
whom
he
had
spoken
bowing
low
at
sight
of
his
royal
questioner
but
the
stranger
who
rescued
him
hath
beyond
doubt
suffered
a
mortal
wound
the
more
fool
he
cried
herod
contemptuously
as
the
horses
again
sprang
forward
in
obedience
to
the
lash
he
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
wicked
laugh
twere
a
pretty
pastime
for
our
leisure
to
root
out
these
pestiferous
fellows
from
the
holy
city
and
twould
doubtless
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
may
we
count
on
thine
assistance
my
prince
said
alexander
eagerly
we
who
are
against
the
nazarenes
grow
fewer
each
day
already
the
greater
number
of
pharisees
either
believe
or
regard
them
with
tolerance
these
all
declare
openly
that
the
dead
carpenter
of
galilee
is
alive
and
is
like
to
return
any
day
to
rule
over
israel
herod
s
face
darkened
let
him
return
and
attempt
it
he
cried
angrily
behind
me
is
rome
chapter
xxii
by
the
thorny
ways
of
his
sin
upon
a
couch
in
the
house
of
john
lay
the
stranger
who
had
rescued
stephen
from
death
about
him
were
gathered
those
of
the
household
who
chanced
to
be
at
home
when
the
sad
little
procession
had
arrived
he
gave
his
life
for
mine
said
stephen
solemnly
looking
down
at
the
quiet
face
across
which
the
shadow
of
approaching
death
had
already
fallen
and
god
hath
accepted
the
sacrifice
it
is
not
his
will
that
he
be
restored
would
that
i
knew
to
whom
i
owe
this
debt
of
gratitude
before
he
goes
hence
he
will
recover
consciousness
i
think
shortly
said
mary
laying
her
cool
white
fingers
on
the
brow
of
the
sufferer
he
is
assuredly
not
a
jew
she
added
gazing
intently
at
the
dark
face
upon
the
pillows
fetch
me
a
basin
and
sponge
my
daughter
it
may
be
that
the
cool
water
will
revive
him
the
girl
to
whom
she
had
spoken
hastened
to
obey
as
she
stooped
to
pour
water
from
a
jar
which
stood
without
in
the
courtyard
a
young
man
hurriedly
entered
the
enclosure
where
is
stephen
he
cried
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
maiden
i
heard
but
just
now
that
herod
had
crushed
him
beneath
his
chariot
wheels
a
brutal
deed
he
that
told
me
was
an
by
the
mercy
of
god
answered
the
girl
with
a
half
sob
he
hath
escaped
with
a
bruise
another
was
smitten
in
his
place
and
he
is
dying
i
must
hasten
with
the
water
and
she
sprang
up
and
hurried
away
the
young
man
followed
and
approaching
the
group
that
surrounded
the
couch
he
looked
over
the
shoulder
of
the
young
girl
as
she
held
the
basin
ready
for
the
hand
of
mary
he
started
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
wounded
man
he
is
an
egyptian
he
exclaimed
even
as
he
spoke
the
man
opened
his
eyes
water
he
gasped
faintly
stephen
raised
the
languid
head
while
the
skilful
hand
of
mary
held
the
cup
lay
him
down
again
gently
so
she
said
in
a
low
voice
then
stephen
bent
over
the
pillow
canst
thou
tell
us
who
thou
art
and
why
it
was
that
thou
didst
choose
the
life
of
another
rather
than
thine
own
the
dull
eyes
brightened
a
little
did
i
save
him
ah
yes
thanks
be
to
the
gods
thou
art
alive
did
any
hurt
befall
thee
nay
but
i
live
alas
because
thou
art
to
die
it
is
well
not
only
that
thou
wilt
live
but
that
i
shall
die
if
the
god
whom
thou
dost
proclaim
will
but
count
my
worthless
life
a
sacrifice
for
my
many
sins
nay
my
brother
said
stephen
if
thou
dost
but
believe
on
jesus
the
christ
there
is
no
sacrifice
needed
for
sin
he
gave
himself
a
sacrifice
for
our
transgressions
because
of
the
love
which
he
bare
us
it
can
not
be
that
he
loves
me
said
the
sick
man
listen
till
i
shall
tell
thee
all
i
am
an
egyptian
my
name
is
amu
the
maiden
who
still
stood
at
his
bedside
grew
very
white
at
the
sound
of
that
name
and
the
newcomer
who
was
watching
from
behind
reached
quietly
out
and
took
the
basin
from
her
nerveless
fingers
anat
he
whispered
tis
a
common
enough
name
it
is
he
she
returned
i
know
the
voice
but
listen
early
in
life
continued
the
egyptian
his
voice
gathering
strength
i
was
even
as
others
neither
better
nor
worse
tis
not
of
those
days
i
would
speak
but
of
the
days
when
i
was
a
man
grown
then
it
chanced
that
there
came
a
certain
stranger
out
of
the
wilderness
with
his
wife
and
child
and
sojourned
in
egypt
he
possessed
gold
and
bought
for
himself
a
plot
of
land
not
far
from
the
river
this
he
tilled
with
industry
so
that
after
a
time
he
gained
more
gold
and
bought
still
another
bit
of
tillage
not
much
for
land
was
costly
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
river
i
was
his
neighbor
and
i
was
not
unfriendly
to
him
for
he
was
a
stranger
and
knew
not
the
ways
of
the
people
nor
at
the
first
the
proper
grains
to
cast
into
the
earth
and
because
i
helped
him
in
such
small
matters
he
loved
me
and
clave
to
me
as
also
his
wife
and
i
was
ever
an
honored
guest
in
their
house
after
a
time
there
came
a
great
sickness
over
all
the
region
about
the
upper
nile
because
the
river
failed
to
overflow
his
banks
at
the
proper
season
the
people
were
wasted
by
it
and
they
died
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
my
father
and
my
brothers
died
and
the
plot
of
land
which
had
been
theirs
came
to
me
after
a
time
the
man
who
had
come
out
of
the
wilderness
was
likewise
stricken
and
his
wife
and
when
it
presently
appeared
that
they
both
must
die
he
sent
for
me
and
spake
to
me
after
this
manner
my
friend
who
hath
been
to
me
even
as
a
brother
in
this
land
of
strangers
wherein
we
have
sojourned
i
am
sorely
stricken
both
i
and
the
mother
of
the
children
and
it
must
presently
come
to
pass
that
we
be
gathered
to
our
fathers
but
before
my
soul
passes
i
would
fain
speak
to
thee
of
my
little
ones
who
will
be
left
desolate
if
so
be
that
the
plague
spares
speak
i
made
answer
i
will
do
with
them
as
thou
dost
then
he
told
me
how
that
he
was
a
greek
born
in
antioch
and
the
son
of
a
rich
man
after
his
father
died
a
fierce
quarrel
arose
betwixt
the
two
brothers
over
the
division
of
the
inheritance
and
when
after
many
days
the
bitterness
still
continued
it
came
to
pass
that
he
smote
his
brother
and
wounded
him
sore
then
taking
what
he
would
he
fled
away
into
the
wilderness
there
he
took
to
himself
a
wife
from
the
tribes
that
wandered
in
the
desert
and
afterward
came
to
dwell
in
egypt
now
i
pray
and
beseech
thee
he
said
to
me
by
all
that
thou
boldest
sacred
that
thou
wilt
take
my
two
children
and
the
price
of
the
land
when
thou
shalt
have
sold
it
and
fetch
them
to
my
brother
for
i
have
heard
that
he
yet
liveth
and
say
to
him
this
thy
brother
is
dead
he
sendeth
thee
the
money
that
he
took
away
and
more
and
here
are
also
his
two
children
let
them
find
favor
in
thy
sight
i
pray
thee
for
they
are
i
promised
my
neighbor
that
i
would
do
what
he
desired
of
me
and
i
sware
it
by
the
temple
of
ptah
hotep
and
by
the
sacred
nile
and
by
the
soul
of
my
father
and
when
he
had
told
me
his
brother
s
name
and
how
to
find
him
he
turned
himself
about
on
his
bed
and
spoke
no
more
in
that
same
day
both
he
and
his
wife
perished
of
the
two
children
one
was
likewise
stricken
and
i
watched
her
many
days
till
she
recovered
afterward
i
perceived
that
she
had
become
blind
by
reason
of
the
plague
that
season
i
could
not
sell
the
land
for
there
were
none
to
buy
so
i
planted
the
crops
and
reaped
them
and
the
children
ate
and
were
satisfied
but
the
money
i
received
for
the
grain
i
kept
for
i
said
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
wages
the
next
season
i
also
planted
and
reaped
and
the
next
and
at
the
time
of
the
third
harvest
a
man
came
to
me
and
said
wilt
thou
sell
this
land
for
thy
neighbor
s
children
and
i
answered
him
nay
i
will
not
sell
my
neighbor
owed
me
money
and
he
died
without
repaying
me
therefore
is
the
land
mine
and
after
a
time
i
came
almost
to
believe
what
i
had
said
but
i
waxed
exceeding
bitter
against
the
two
children
who
were
as
yet
only
babes
so
i
sent
them
away
to
a
woman
who
dwelt
in
the
tombs
above
the
river
and
i
paid
her
to
keep
them
afterward
she
died
and
the
two
continued
to
dwell
alone
in
the
tombs
they
grew
and
waxed
strong
though
no
one
cared
for
them
for
the
boy
was
lusty
and
brave
he
had
become
a
still
i
kept
a
watch
upon
them
for
i
feared
lest
they
should
in
some
way
find
out
what
i
had
done
though
i
confessed
it
to
no
one
not
even
my
wife
after
a
time
the
fear
grew
upon
me
so
that
i
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
and
i
resolved
to
rid
myself
of
the
two
i
had
not
yet
grown
evil
enough
to
wish
to
slay
them
so
i
turned
the
thing
over
in
my
mind
for
many
days
at
the
last
i
was
resolved
what
to
do
i
would
sell
them
for
slaves
then
would
they
be
taken
away
and
i
should
be
free
from
my
fears
not
only
so
but
i
should
receive
gold
with
which
to
buy
more
land
but
when
i
would
have
accomplished
my
desires
upon
them
they
fled
away
into
the
desert
and
assuredly
perished
for
though
i
searched
for
them
long
i
could
never
find
what
had
become
of
them
why
didst
thou
search
for
them
said
seth
suddenly
as
the
man
paused
to
drink
from
the
cup
which
mary
again
held
to
his
parched
lips
i
searched
for
them
replied
the
man
his
eyes
resting
upon
his
questioner
s
face
with
a
startled
expression
because
nay
i
hardly
know
why
i
had
repented
me
of
my
desire
to
make
slaves
of
them
but
i
was
not
ready
to
give
up
the
land
what
became
of
besa
i
found
him
dead
in
the
tomb
where
he
thought
the
twain
were
hidden
answered
the
egyptian
as
if
in
a
dream
but
who
art
thou
that
dost
question
me
and
he
half
raised
himself
in
the
bed
his
livid
face
growing
yet
more
ghastly
with
the
painful
effort
we
are
the
children
of
the
man
thou
didst
wrong
said
seth
fiercely
tell
me
what
was
the
name
of
our
kinsman
that
we
may
yet
seek
him
as
our
father
willed
his
name
was
erastus
but
alas
he
is
dead
now
these
many
years
i
sought
him
that
i
might
render
an
account
of
what
i
had
done
for
i
feared
death
on
account
of
my
sin
neither
dared
i
pray
any
more
to
the
avenging
gods
for
had
i
not
foresworn
myself
in
their
names
so
because
there
was
no
longer
any
comfort
for
me
in
the
lands
which
i
possessed
nor
in
my
children
nor
in
anything
in
the
whole
land
of
egypt
i
became
a
wanderer
in
far
countries
here
in
jerusalem
not
many
days
since
i
chanced
to
hear
a
wondrous
thing
that
they
which
had
sinned
might
find
peace
and
forgiveness
in
one
jesus
of
nazareth
who
had
lived
upon
earth
that
he
might
save
them
which
were
that
same
day
i
beheld
him
that
had
spoken
these
words
and
i
drew
near
desiring
to
ask
him
still
further
of
the
matter
when
on
a
sudden
i
saw
that
he
was
in
mortal
peril
i
scarce
know
what
followed
but
i
longed
to
save
him
if
only
that
i
might
hear
once
more
the
strange
story
of
the
man
jesus
tell
me
and
the
man
s
glazing
eyes
sought
stephen
thou
hast
heard
all
is
there
forgiveness
for
such
as
i
there
is
forgiveness
for
every
one
that
doth
repent
and
believe
in
the
lord
jesus
said
stephen
softly
surely
thou
mayest
pass
in
peace
my
brother
for
god
hath
led
thee
even
by
the
thorny
ways
of
thy
sin
unto
himself
the
dying
man
s
eyes
again
brightened
his
lips
moved
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
the
youth
and
the
maiden
who
had
sunken
to
their
knees
by
his
bedside
wilt
thou
also
forgive
he
murmured
yes
yes
we
forgive
thee
fully
as
also
we
hope
to
be
forgiven
cried
seth
pressing
his
lips
to
the
cold
hand
which
had
so
cruelly
wronged
him
thy
mother
her
name
was
zarah
faltered
the
egyptian
she
was
the
daughter
of
his
voice
failed
him
thrice
he
made
an
unavailing
effort
to
speak
then
the
eternal
silence
fell
softly
upon
him
he
hath
passed
into
the
presence
of
the
love
that
hath
led
him
through
all
the
weary
way
of
his
life
said
mary
solemnly
there
will
he
find
peace
chapter
xxiii
in
the
synagogue
of
the
nazarenes
for
what
have
we
been
called
together
at
this
time
knowest
thou
asked
a
man
of
his
neighbor
in
the
crowd
assembled
before
the
synagogue
of
the
nazarenes
seeing
that
this
is
not
the
prescribed
day
for
worship
tis
that
we
may
consider
the
matter
of
which
the
grecians
have
been
murmuring
of
late
replied
the
other
their
widows
say
they
are
neglected
in
the
daily
ministrations
not
more
than
the
widows
of
our
own
blood
the
fault
lieth
with
the
young
men
to
whom
of
late
the
apostles
have
been
forced
to
give
a
part
of
the
work
but
see
the
doors
are
opened
the
twain
together
with
the
rest
of
the
quiet
and
orderly
multitude
passed
into
the
porch
where
each
person
paused
for
an
instant
to
dip
his
hands
into
the
brazen
urn
of
water
which
stood
without
the
door
this
constituting
the
ceremonial
washing
of
hands
required
before
entering
into
the
sacred
enclosure
the
scene
within
did
not
differ
materially
from
that
which
might
have
been
seen
in
any
other
of
the
four
hundred
and
eighty
synagogues
of
jerusalem
against
the
wall
opposite
the
entrance
beneath
a
canopy
of
purple
cloth
stood
the
wooden
chest
or
ark
containing
the
scrolls
of
the
law
above
this
ark
burned
the
perpetual
light
token
of
the
visible
glory
of
the
lord
as
it
was
revealed
in
that
first
temple
which
their
forefathers
had
reared
in
the
wilderness
this
sacred
light
was
a
symbol
for
it
also
served
to
remind
the
worshipper
of
the
human
soul
which
is
the
breath
of
god
as
it
is
written
the
spirit
of
man
is
the
candle
of
the
lord
and
of
the
divine
law
for
thy
commandment
is
a
lamp
and
thy
law
is
light
here
also
facing
the
congregation
was
the
desk
from
which
the
ruler
of
the
synagogue
was
wont
to
preside
over
the
worship
and
at
one
side
elevated
upon
a
raised
platform
twelve
wooden
seats
were
provided
for
the
twelve
apostles
the
visible
heads
of
the
church
it
being
the
custom
in
all
synagogues
to
thus
elevate
above
the
common
rank
those
who
were
considered
the
most
enlightened
in
these
as
in
all
other
respects
did
the
disciples
walk
orderly
as
after
the
law
being
yet
minded
despite
the
warning
of
the
master
to
put
the
strong
new
wine
of
the
kingdom
into
the
ancient
bottles
of
judaism
on
this
day
after
that
the
congregation
had
seated
themselves
in
due
order
the
men
upon
one
side
of
the
room
the
women
and
children
upon
the
other
separated
by
a
low
wooden
partition
the
service
was
begun
by
the
chanting
of
the
sacrificial
psalms
after
which
the
whole
congregation
arose
and
repeated
as
with
one
voice
the
benediction
called
the
creator
of
light
blessed
art
thou
o
lord
our
god
king
of
the
universe
who
createst
light
and
formest
darkness
who
makest
peace
and
createst
all
things
he
in
mercy
causes
the
light
to
shine
upon
the
earth
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
in
goodness
renews
every
day
the
work
of
creation
blessed
art
thou
the
creator
of
light
and
also
this
the
great
love
with
great
love
hast
thou
loved
us
o
lord
our
god
thou
hast
shown
us
great
and
abundant
mercy
o
our
father
and
king
for
the
sake
of
our
forefathers
who
trusted
in
thee
thou
who
didst
teach
them
the
love
of
life
have
mercy
upon
us
and
teach
us
also
to
praise
thee
o
lord
who
in
love
hast
chosen
thy
people
then
did
matthias
who
on
this
day
had
been
chosen
to
lead
the
worship
and
who
like
the
rest
of
the
congregation
wore
the
fringed
garment
prescribed
by
law
and
the
phylacteries
upon
his
head
and
upon
his
left
arm
arise
and
cry
aloud
in
the
words
of
the
ancient
prayer
which
was
called
the
kadish
all
the
people
joining
heartily
in
the
amens
exalted
and
hallowed
be
his
great
name
in
the
world
which
he
created
according
to
his
will
let
his
kingdom
come
in
your
lifetime
and
in
the
lifetime
of
the
whole
house
of
israel
very
speedily
amen
blessed
be
his
great
name
world
without
end
amen
blessed
and
praised
celebrated
and
exalted
extolled
and
adorned
magnified
and
worshipped
be
thy
holy
name
blessed
be
he
far
above
all
benedictions
hymns
thanks
praises
and
consolations
which
have
been
uttered
in
this
world
amen
may
the
prayers
and
supplications
of
all
israel
be
graciously
received
before
their
father
in
heaven
amen
may
perfect
peace

us
and
all
israel
amen
may
he
who
makes
peace
in
his
heaven
confer
peace
upon
us
and
all
israel
amen
then
followed
the
eighteen
benedictions
of
which
the
first
sentence
only
was
repeated
in
a
loud
voice
by
the
leader
the
rest
being
recited
by
the
congregation
in
unison
save
this
prayer
which
all
repeated
aloud
and
with
a
joyous
tone
of
full
expectation
for
they
knew
him
to
whom
they
prayed
to
jerusalem
thy
city
in
mercy
return
and
dwell
in
it
according
to
thy
promise
make
it
speedily
in
our
day
an
everlasting
building
and
soon
establish
therein
the
throne
of
david
blessed
art
thou
o
lord
who
buildest
jerusalem
and
so
to
the
end
closing
with
the
words
our
father
bless
us
all
unitedly
with
the
light
of
thy
countenance
for
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
didst
thou
give
to
us
o
lord
our
god
the
law
of
life
loving
kindness
justice
blessing
compassion
life
and
peace
may
it
please
thee
to
bless
thy
people
israel
at
all
times
and
in
every
moment
with
peace
blessed
art
thou
o
lord
who
blessest
thy
people
israel
with
peace
then
followed
the
reading
from
the
scriptures
afterward
peter
arose
in
his
place
and
spoke
to
the
people
he
brought
again
to
their
remembrance
the
words
of
their
risen
lord
how
that
they
should
continue
to
dwell
together
in
all
peace
and
love
forbearing
one
another
and
loving
one
another
in
expectation
of
that
great
day
perhaps
nigh
at
hand
when
he
should
return
bringing
his
reward
with
him
for
them
that
had
been
faithful
in
all
he
spoke
also
of
the
matter
which
had
been
troubling
the
minds
of
many
during
the
days
that
were
past
god
knoweth
brethren
he
said
that
we
would
not
willingly
neglect
any
who
by
the
grace
of
our
lord
have
joined
themselves
with
us
least
of
all
them
who
by
reason
of
their
affliction
are
dependent
upon
our
bounty
if
any
have
been
neglected
it
is
because
of
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
the
work
hath
waxed
too
great
for
us
for
besides
this
duty
of
the
daily
distribution
of
bodily
food
to
them
that
lack
there
remaineth
also
the
duty
whereunto
we
were
set
apart
by
the
master
himself
of
preaching
the
good
tidings
of
salvation
from
sin
and
from
death
unto
all
men
it
is
not
reason
that
we
should
set
aside
the
work
of
god
to
serve
tables
and
it
is
manifest
that
we
can
not
longer
do
both
wherefore
brethren
look
ye
out
among
you
seven
men
of
honest
report
full
of
the
holy
ghost
and
wisdom
whom
we
may
appoint
over
this
business
but
we
will
give
ourselves
continually
to
prayer
and
to
the
ministry
of
the
and
when
he
had
finished
speaking
philip
arose
in
his
place
if
i
read
aright
your
faces
my
brothers
he
said
looking
around
about
upon
the
multitude
this
good
saying
hath
pleased
you
all
let
us
therefore
choose
and
that
there
may
no
longer
be
any
thought
of
jealousy
betwixt
jew
and
greek
which
thing
also
must
be
displeasing
unto
him
who
according
to
his
word
is
at
this
time
in
our
midst
let
it
come
to
pass
that
of
the
seven
which
we
shall
choose
three
shall
be
hebrews
three
greeks
and
one
a
proselyte
then
shall
there
be
no
longer
need
nor
excuse
that
any
should
murmur
concerning
this
matter
of
the
dispensations
and
these
sayings
being
approved
of
them
which
were
assembled
one
aristarchus
arose
and
presented
the
name
of
stephen
for
the
honorable
office
of
deacon
for
he
is
declared
the
speaker
as
is
known
unto
you
all
a
man
full
of
faith
and
of
the
spirit
and
all
the
people
cried
with
one
voice
worthy
he
is
worthy
then
did
they
in
the
same
manner
choose
also
philip
and
prochorus
nicanor
timon
and
parmenas
and
also
according
to
the
word
of
philip
nicolas
of
antioch
who
was
a
convert
to
the
jewish
faith
and
these
seven
stood
up
before
the
apostles
and
before
all
the
congregation
of
the
people
and
when
the
apostles
had
prayed
they
laid
their
hands
upon
them
in
token
that
thus
were
they
set
apart
unto
the
sacred
duties
of
their
calling
chapter
xxiv
the
warning
the
bell
which
hung
beside
the
porter
s
lodge
jangled
sharply
and
the
porter
after
first
peering
out
to
see
who
stood
before
the
door
promptly
opened
my
master
is
within
he
said
making
his
obeisance
i
pray
thee
enter
reverend
sir
thou
wilt
find
my
lord
annas
upon
the
terrace
he
is
expecting
thee
without
a
word
the
newcomer
strode
past
and
disappeared
within
the
porter
stared
after
his
retreating
figure
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
shook
his
head
slowly
his
look
is
dark
and
threatening
he
muttered
it
bodes
no
good
for
them
that
believe
when
at
night
and
at
morning
and
also
at
midday
those
that
hate
us
gather
themselves
in
secret
conclave
there
be
mischiefs
brewing
i
fear
me
a
dark
cloud
which
will
break
ere
long
and
bring
swift
destruction
upon
the
church
unless
the
lord
send
help
and
that
right
speedily
and
what
hast
thou
found
to
grumble
about
now
simon
said
a
cheery
voice
at
his
elbow
the
old
man
looked
up
sharply
ah
iddo
didst
thou
hear
me
i
am
indeed
falling
into
indiscreet
habits
in
my
solitude
when
i
prate
aloud
of
my
fears
had
it
been
aaron
now
in
thy
stead
but
why
do
i
say
so
i
am
not
ashamed
to
own
that
i
believe
on
the
nazarene
thou
art
in
good
company
assuredly
said
the
young
man
though
an
open
avowal
of
thy
faith
would
doubtless
cost
thee
thy
snug
quarters
the
lord
of
this
house
is
not
likely
to
be
of
them
which
are
daily
being
added
to
the
church
hast
thou
heard
that
of
the
priests
themselves
we
are
continually
gaining
in
great
numbers
tis
wonderful
all
jerusalem
will
be
with
us
in
another
year
as
for
these
worldly
old
hypocrites
let
them
be
they
will
die
in
their
sins
and
the
world
will
be
better
without
them
even
the
master
had
no
good
word
for
such
whited
sepulchres
called
he
them
and
pronounced
against
them
the
woes
which
they
assuredly
have
merited
nothing
can
stand
against
us
now
for
the
lord
is
with
us
but
simon
shook
his
head
thou
art
young
iddo
he
said
querulously
and
hast
much
to
learn
there
is
a
storm
at
hand
and
it
will
blow
no
good
to
the
church
i
have
said
it
and
thou
wilt
see
do
i
not
stand
at
this
gate
and
see
them
that
go
in
and
out
i
hear
also
many
things
for
the
lord
hath
preserved
my
ears
and
they
that
enter
mind
me
no
more
than
yonder
stone
bench
listen
and
the
old
man
held
up
a
shaking
hand
yesterday
i
admitted
two
four
five
of
them
that
be
rich
and
mighty
i
will
not
name
them
they
remained
within
three
whole
hours
by
the
shadow
on
yonder
dial
then
they
came
out
together
tis
a
goodly
thought
of
annas
to
first
put
out
of
the
way
the
pestilential
greek
quoth
one
the
witnesses
will
not
be
hard
to
i
trow
not
said
another
with
a
laugh
words
are
cheap
both
for
the
buying
and
selling
as
for
the
fellow
stephen
he
doeth
more
mischief
among
the
common
people
in
a
week
than
the
hinds
whom
they
call
apostles
could
accomplish
in
a
stephen
cried
iddo
aghast
hist
boy
now
thou
seest
that
though
i
am
old
and
as
thou
hast
said
given
to
foreboding
there
is
a
deadly
mischief
on
foot
the
lord
will
smite
them
if
they
lay
but
a
finger
on
stephen
exclaimed
the
young
man
indignantly
tis
such
as
he
that
the
lord
s
flock
hath
need
of
daily
doth
he
work
great
miracles
of
healing
and
his
voice
is
heard
in
every
synagogue
persuading
men
to
believe
on
jesus
the
christ
men
listen
gladly
and
to
listen
is
to
be
convinced
of
the
truth
ah
boy
tis
because
of
these
very
things
that
they
hate
him
were
he
less
than
he
is
they
would
not
lay
a
finger
on
him
but
surely
god
will
protect
him
god
spared
not
his
own
son
said
the
old
man
solemnly
he
suffered
him
to
be
tortured
and
to
be
slain
at
the
hands
of
these
very
men
and
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
the
other
was
silent
for
a
time
all
the
brightness
had
faded
out
from
his
face
who
is
within
now
he
said
at
length
saul
of
tarsus
replied
simon
briefly
i
shall
warn
them
of
the
household
of
john
of
this
thou
hast
told
me
assuredly
but
let
it
not
be
bruited
abroad
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
it
and
perhaps
much
to
be
lost
if
the
young
man
stephen
but
the
clang
of
the
bell
interrupted
him
and
he
hastened
to
open
enter
my
lord
i
pray
thee
it
is
so
my
lord
annas
is
within
and
with
him
the
rabbi
saul
iddo
bowed
with
instinctive
respect
as
the
tall
gaunt
figure
swept
by
him
and
disappeared
adown
the
passageway
he
is
no
longer
high
priest
he
said
in
a
half
whisper
and
it
perchance
hath
irked
him
to
resign
the
office
there
are
other
reasons
for
his
haggard
look
said
the
old
man
sagely
but
it
is
not
for
such
as
i
to
prate
concerning
the
affairs
of
caiaphas
the
lord
hath
dealt
with
him
as
he
doth
also
deal
with
all
men
perchance
that
he
may
draw
them
to
himself
at
the
last
nay
dost
thou
think
then
that
it
is
possible
for
such
as
the
murderers
of
our
lord
to
be
forgiven
tis
assuredly
not
for
us
to
set
limits
upon
the
compassion
and
love
of
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
who
also
prayed
for
them
in
his
agony
if
he
can
save
me
he
is
able
to
save
any
one
for
i
know
my
own
heart
how
that
it
is
deceitful
above
all
things
and
desperately
wicked
that
is
a
true
word
my
simon
said
the
young
man
humbly
no
one
knoweth
it
better
than
i
who
was
ever
prone
to
do
evil
as
the
sparks
fly
i
must
away
if
stephen
could
but
be
persuaded
to
leave
jerusalem
twas
what
i
would
have
said
broke
in
simon
eagerly
let
him
go
and
at
once
there
is
no
need
that
he
remain
to
fall
into
the
net
which
these
are
making
ready
for
him
it
may
be
that
it
was
by
the
good
providence
of
god
that
i
chanced
to
hear
what
i
did
then
as
he
opened
the
door
that
the
young
man
might
pass
out
he
whispered
let
them
all
beware
of
the
pharisee
from
tarsus
tis
a
word
of
wisdom
said
iddo
to
himself
as
he
strode
rapidly
away
yet
would
he
dare
molest
us
who
walk
orderly
after
the
law
if
now
we
kept
not
the
fasts
nor
observed
the
solemn
feasts
nor
prayed
at
the
times
of
the
morning
and
evening
sacrifice
but
all
of
these
things
we
observe
and
do
yet
have
i
heard
stephen
proclaim
in
the
synagogues
that
there
was
now
no
further
need
for
the
priestly
slaughter
of
flocks
and
herds
because
that
christ
had
given
himself
a
sacrifice
for
the
sins
not
only
of
the
jews
but
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
even
the
apostles
say
not
such
things
it
must
be
that
he
is
being
a
greek
some
one
should
speak
to
him
of
the
matter
revolving
these
thoughts
in
his
mind
the
young
man
came
at
length
into
the
street
where
was
the
house
of
john
the
apostle
it
was
narrow
and
still
and
hot
the
feet
of
the
few
mostly
women
passing
to
and
from
the
public
fountains
with
their
making
no
noise
in
the
yellow
dust
iddo
paused
a
moment
with
bent
head
he
smiled
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
she
is
singing
he
said
aloud
and
he
hurried
forward
faster
than
before
almost
stumbling
indeed
in
his
haste
over
some
small
brown
object
which
squatted
silently
in
the
hot
sunshine
before
the
door
which
he
sought
what
is
this
he
cried
looking
down
and
discovering
that
the
obstacle
was
none
other
than
a
small
brown
child
that
there
were
in
fact
three
of
them
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
betwixt
the
two
a
baby
smaller
and
browner
than
either
we
be
listening
said
the
girl
solemnly
shaking
the
dark
curls
out
of
her
eyes
and
looking
up
at
her
questioner
the
baby
hath
gone
to
sleep
because
he
likes
it
we
come
every
day
wilt
thou
sit
down
here
the
dust
is
soft
and
the
music
is
like
angels
singing
iddo
smiled
thou
art
right
little
one
he
said
tis
like
the
voice
of
an
angel
i
lift
up
mine
eyes
to
the
hills
whence
cometh
my
help
my
help
is
from
jehovah
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
chanted
the
melodious
voice
within
then
it
dropped
to
a
pleading
cadence
may
he
not
suffer
thy
foot
to
be
moved
may
he
not
slumber
that
keepeth
thee
behold
the
keeper
of
israel
shall
neither
slumber
nor
sleep
jehovah
keep
thee
from
all
evil
he
will
keep
thy
life
jehovah
keep
thy
coming
and
going
henceforth
and
for
ever
the
listener
sighed
involuntarily
then
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
the
bell
paying
no
heed
to
the
solemn
little
voice
at
his
feet
if
thou
dost
pull
the
rope
the
singing
will
stop
almost
immediately
the
door
opened
and
a
sweet
voice
cried
ah
tis
thou
iddo
ben
obed
enter
i
pray
thee
then
observing
the
young
man
s
serious
face
she
added
what
hath
befallen
thee
friend
thou
art
as
solemn
as
that
great
image
in
the
desert
which
men
call
the
sphinx
i
have
reason
answered
ben
obed
as
thou
must
hear
presently
i
must
first
speak
to
the
little
enter
friend
thou
wilt
find
my
brother
within
why
didst
thou
not
knock
little
one
she
continued
stooping
to
raise
the
sleeping
child
the
sun
is
too
hot
for
the
babe
it
breedeth
mischief
at
this
season
stay
i
will
give
thee
some
pomegranates
then
must
thou
go
home
where
it
is
cool
if
thou
wilt
come
and
knock
on
the
door
thou
shalt
enter
then
i
will
sing
to
thee
and
also
tell
thee
a
story
of
how
the
babe
jesus
came
through
the
wilderness
to
the
land
of
egypt
and
having
kissed
the
smooth
brown
cheeks
in
token
of
dismissal
she
watched
the
two
as
they
trudged
away
down
the
street
the
sleepy
baby
toddling
between
ben
obed
was
already
seated
upon
the
stone
bench
in
the
cool
shadow
of
the
house
talking
in
low
tones
to
a
young
man
of
about
his
own
age
who
with
bent
brows
and
serious
air
was
paying
him
diligent
heed
i
can
scarce
believe
that
such
talk
is
more
than
idle
threatening
he
was
saying
since
the
day
that
gamaliel
gave
counsel
in
the
sanhedrim
that
we
be
left
in
peace
there
hath
been
no
active
persecution
they
must
see
by
this
time
that
the
lord
is
with
us
therefore
is
the
good
counsel
of
gamaliel
proven
surely
there
can
be
none
amongst
them
bold
enough
to
fight
against
god
and
this
said
i
to
simon
or
words
of
like
import
i
reminded
him
also
that
we
are
well
looked
upon
by
all
the
people
and
how
being
in
all
points
disposed
to
keep
the
law
even
the
priests
are
daily
joining
themselves
to
our
numbers
but
he
hath
a
different
opinion
moreover
he
bade
me
tell
all
of
this
household
to
beware
saul
of
tarsus
what
danger
is
threatened
asked
anat
anxiously
iddo
ben
obed
raised
his
eyes
to
her
face
and
there
was
that
in
their
fiery
gaze
that
brought
the
warm
color
to
the
maiden
s
cheek
danger
is
threatened
to
stephen
he
said
slowly
though
how
great
is
that
danger
we
can
not
tell
the
face
of
anat
grew
deathly
pale
tell
me
she
said
breathlessly
all
that
thou
hast
heard
iddo
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
ground
they
will
imprison
him
if
he
continues
to
preach
that
the
christ
is
mightier
than
the
law
he
said
coldly
what
more
i
know
not
twill
be
best
for
him
to
leave
jerusalem
anat
turned
swiftly
and
went
away
into
the
house
that
evening
she
told
the
three
children
the
story
which
she
had
promised
them
and
sang
to
them
wild
songs
of
the
desert
vaguely
remembered
from
the
days
when
she
dwelt
in
egypt
and
afterward
the
psalm
of
the
watchful
love
which
she
had
sung
in
the
morning
then
she
gave
the
little
ones
into
the
hand
of
their
mother
and
went
softly
up
to
the
housetop
a
lonely
figure
stood
by
the
parapet
looking
away
toward
the
afterglow
which
burned
in
solemn
splendor
behind
the
mountains
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
went
lightly
forward
hast
thou
heard
she
said
softly
the
evil
tidings
which
the
son
of
obed
brought
to
this
house
i
have
talked
with
john
concerning
it
and
what
said
he
surely
he
urged
thee
to
flee
the
peril
and
the
girl
s
voice
thrilled
with
passionate
entreaty
the
young
man
turned
anat
beloved
he
said
softly
i
know
all
that
thou
wouldst
say
and
there
is
much
in
my
heart
that
i
would
fain
say
to
thee
only
that
the
time
is
short
already
for
me
the
daylight
fades
and
the
night
cometh
when
i
can
no
more
work
for
the
master
while
for
thee
there
yet
remaineth
many
years
wherein
to
glorify
his
name
and
this
shalt
thou
do
and
in
the
doing
find
peace
the
peace
that
passeth
understanding
the
girl
had
sunken
to
her
knees
beside
him
her
slender
frame
shaken
with
a
tempest
of
weeping
but
a
great
calm
fell
upon
her
soul
as
stephen
rested
his
hands
upon
her
bowed
head
his
voice
tremulous
in
that
sweetest
of
all
benedictions
the
lord
bless
thee
and
keep
thee
the
lord
make
his
face
shine
upon
thee
and
be
gracious
unto
thee
the
lord
lift
up
his
countenance
upon
thee
and
give
thee
peace
chapter
xxv
the
wrath
of
man
thou
hast
the
witnesses
i
have
the
witnesses
my
lord
but
there
was
no
small
difficulty
in
persuading
any
man
to
serve
a
score
refused
outright
reviling
me
moreover
and
threatening
me
with
death
should
i
dare
to
molest
the
fellow
i
placated
them
as
best
i
was
able
saying
that
i
but
desired
to
assure
myself
that
the
reports
which
i
had
heard
against
so
excellent
a
man
were
false
yet
do
i
fear
that
these
may
fetch
him
word
so
that
he
will
escape
out
of
our
hands
he
shall
not
escape
what
witnesses
hast
thou
one
esek
a
money
lender
who
for
the
sum
of
ten
shekels
of
silver
hath
consented
to
witness
and
with
him
two
of
mine
own
underlings
who
will
speak
that
which
is
put
into
their
mouths
with
all
diligence
both
on
account
of
the
reward
which
i
have
promised
if
they
shall
acquit
themselves
well
and
because
of
the
scourging
which
awaits
them
should
they
fail
one
of
them
is
iddo
ben
obed
a
young
man
of
some
promise
who
hath
by
my
orders
frequented
their
synagogue
much
of
late
and
can
therefore
speak
understandingly
of
the
thing
to
him
have
i
promised
sure
advancement
if
he
shall
please
the
council
this
day
thou
art
a
faithful
servant
caleb
and
shall
thyself
not
fail
of
thy
reward
said
annas
approvingly
now
see
to
it
that
the
council
chamber
be
prepared
with
all
speed
we
must
accomplish
the
thing
quickly
lest
this
favorable
opportunity
pass
by
us
hast
thou
the
man
under
espionage
that
thou
mayest
lay
hands
upon
him
without
delay
he
is
at
this
moment
engaged
in
his
duties
of
almoner
my
lord
distributing
amongst
the
rabble
of
jerusalem
that
which
is
little
better
than
stolen
from
the
temple
treasury
in
that
it
is
withholden
from
us
unlawfully
afterward
he
hath
the
intent
to
harangue
the
people
according
to
his
custom
he
will
find
a
different
audience
interrupted
annas
grimly
and
one
that
can
not
be
led
away
by
specious
words
in
what
synagogue
wilt
thou
find
him
they
purpose
to
assemble
in
solomon
s
porch
that
they
may
entrap
the
multitude
the
fellow
stephen
will
interpret
the
prophets
wickedly
alleging
as
do
they
all
that
holy
men
such
as
moses
isaiah
and
all
the
prophets
foretold
as
the
messiah
the
fruit
of
the
accursed
tree
little
need
to
suborn
witnesses
when
they
openly
profane
the
holy
places
of
the
earth
with
such
blasphemies
but
go
now
keep
the
fellow
under
thine
own
eye
till
i
shall
send
thee
word
then
fetch
him
with
all
speed
together
with
the
witnesses
stay
a
moment
see
that
there
is
no
tumult
made
when
he
is
arrested
caleb
smiled
as
he
again
bowed
himself
before
his
superior
i
have
devised
a
cunning
plan
wherewith
to
entrap
him
without
tumult
he
replied
all
is
going
well
said
annas
to
himself
when
he
was
left
alone
our
patient
and
apparently
fruitless
toil
is
at
last
about
to
be
rewarded
besides
caleb
who
shall
in
no
wise
lose
his
reward
we
must
not
forget
that
we
owe
much
to
the
discretion
and
zeal
of
malluch
and
zared
who
have
diligently
spoken
against
this
man
and
his
words
to
the
people
the
sum
agreed
upon
was
forty
pieces
of
silver
for
each
of
them
a
goodly
sum
for
such
as
they
yet
if
s
descending
sun
finds
the
man
dead
i
will
command
that
it
be
made
fifty
but
here
is
our
pharisee
from
tarsus
i
must
deal
wisely
with
him
i
would
that
he
were
a
sadducee
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
is
a
mischievous
one
and
one
moreover
which
these
blasphemous
nazarenes
preach
without
ceasing
greetings
to
thee
my
son
this
will
prove
a
glorious
day
with
us
if
it
shall
witness
a
signal
victory
over
unrighteousness
the
newcomer
received
this
friendly
greeting
with
chilling
hauteur
god
knoweth
that
i
long
to
see
the
workers
of
iniquity
put
to
confusion
he
said
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
and
fixing
his
stern
eyes
upon
his
companion
but
lying
and
deceit
are
hateful
to
my
soul
neither
shall
anything
prosper
that
is
accomplished
thereby
the
face
of
annas
hardened
thou
speakest
in
riddles
friend
he
said
coldly
whom
dost
thou
accuse
of
lying
and
deceit
it
hath
come
to
my
ears
that
certain
ones
have
been
hired
to
speak
evil
of
the
man
stephen
that
these
have
stirred
up
the
people
against
him
so
that
they
are
ready
to
lay
hands
upon
him
it
is
true
that
the
man
hath
spoken
freely
and
openly
in
every
synagogue
alleging
that
the
carpenter
of
galilee
was
the
christ
foretold
by
the
prophets
and
that
he
hath
risen
from
the
dead
and
is
become
the
of
them
that
sleep
and
hath
he
convinced
the
learned
saul
of
the
truth
of
these
things
said
annas
with
a
sarcastic
smile
nay
that
were
a
victory
indeed
saul
laughed
aloud
a
harsh
unmirthful
sound
i
am
of
all
men
least
likely
to
become
a
victim
of
this
monstrous
delusion
the
man
should
not
be
suffered
to
speak
further
for
he
hath
the
cunning
tongue
of
a
great
orator
and
convinces
the
people
mightily
neither
i
nor
any
who
have
disputed
with
him
have
been
able
to
undo
the
mischief
that
he
hath
wrought
but
i
like
not
that
we
suborn
liars
to
serve
our
cause
we
forbade
these
men
to
speak
the
name
of
the
nazarene
some
three
years
ago
letting
them
go
with
but
a
scourging
according
to
the
counsel
of
the
most
sapient
gamaliel
whose
pupil
thou
art
but
how
did
they
obey
the
commands
of
the
most
holy
council
and
how
hath
the
advice
of
gamaliel
profited
our
cause
since
that
day
they
have
not
ceased
to
bruit
the
hateful
name
of
jesus
of
nazareth
about
jerusalem
till
the
very
beggars
of
our
streets
pray
to
him
openly
if
we
have
employed
discreet
men
to
assist
us
in
rooting
out
this
menacing
evil
what
is
it
but
the
part
of
wisdom
do
not
the
nazarenes
also
feed
and
clothe
the
men
who
are
daily
spreading
this
poison
to
the
confusion
of
israel
this
man
stephen
being
a
greek
not
only
doth
not
himself
observe
the
law
but
he
is
forever
bringing
to
the
mind
of
the
people
the
words
and
practices
of
the
nazarene
who
would
be
well
forgotten
by
this
were
it
not
for
such
pestilent
fellows
he
diligently
reminds
the
multitude
how
that
the
man
worked
miracles
on
the
sabbath
day
declaring
that
god
would
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
and
how
he
openly
prophesied
the
destruction
of
the
holy
temple
the
carpenter
from
galilee
he
blasphemously
alleges
was
god
made
manifest
in
the
flesh
therefore
his
acts
and
words
are
greater
than
the
law
of
moses
and
rather
to
be
observed
than
any
priestly
commands
for
such
as
this
fellow
there
is
but
one
remedy
as
it
is
written
also
the
mouth
of
them
that
speak
lies
shall
be
saul
was
silent
for
a
moment
before
his
mental
vision
there
arose
the
face
of
stephen
as
he
had
seen
him
many
times
during
the
furious
controversies
which
had
of
late
taken
place
in
the
synagogues
glowing
with
high
courage
hope
and
confidence
and
illumined
withal
by
a
mysterious
light
at
which
he
had
more
than
once
inwardly
marveled
then
his
face
hardened
it
is
just
that
this
apostate
be
put
to
death
he
said
this
is
no
time
for
measures
but
let
it
be
done
according
to
the
law
and
without
fear
of
the
people
thou
hast
said
cried
annas
this
will
we
do
for
the
time
is
ripe
listen
this
very
day
he
shall
be
brought
before
the
council
witnesses
are
at
hand
that
every
word
may
be
established
according
to
the
law
as
it
is
written
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
every
word
shall
be
who
are
the
witnesses
reputable
men
most
reputable
men
one
esek
a
jew
who
dwells
near
to
their
synagogue
and
do
these
testify
freely
without
money
i
mean
again
interrupted
saul
with
an
irritable
gesture
it
is
the
custom
my
son
to
compensate
witnesses
for
the
loss
of
time
entailed
upon
them
in
the
pursuance
of
their
duty
began
annas
smoothly
but
saul
broke
in
rudely
i
will
have
none
of
it
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
and
striding
stormily
up
and
down
the
room
hired
agitators
amongst
the
people
hired
witnesses
against
a
man
who
whatever
his
accursed
beliefs
is
at
least
incapable
of
such
meanness
annas
also
arose
and
with
an
air
of
awful
dignity
fixed
his
piercing
eyes
upon
the
flushed
face
of
the
young
man
thou
dost
assuredly
forget
he
said
slowly
the
respect
due
him
in
whose
presence
thou
art
standing
as
the
head
of
the
family
which
for
many
generations
has
acceptably
served
jehovah
in
that
most
holy
office
i
am
not
lightly
to
be
accused
to
my
face
of
that
which
my
soul
abhorreth
as
also
it
is
written
i
hate
and
abhor
lying
but
thy
law
do
i
twice
hast
thou
cast
this
thing
in
my
teeth
and
in
so
doing
thou
hast
proven
thyself
unworthy
of
the
high
confidence
which
i
have
given
thee
unworthy
of
the
love
which
i
have
freely
bestowed
upon
thee
unworthy
stay
i
beseech
thee
cried
saul
raising
his
hand
he
had
grown
deathly
pale
and
trembled
visibly
it
is
true
i
have
forgotten
myself
i
am
well
nigh
mad
because
of
the
failure
of
all
that
i
had
confidently
hoped
for
day
after
day
have
i
gone
forth
to
do
battle
for
israel
and
day
after
day
have
i
been
worsted
i
am
of
all
men
most
unworthy
in
that
i
have
failed
miserably
failed
i
will
return
to
tarsus
and
thou
shalt
see
my
face
no
more
nay
my
son
said
annas
softly
because
thou
hast
acknowledged
thy
fault
it
is
forgiven
and
dost
think
that
i
have
not
watched
thee
in
this
thy
struggle
against
iniquity
that
my
heart
has
not
bled
for
thee
possess
now
thy
soul
in
patience
trust
in
the
lord
and
in
me
and
it
shall
assuredly
come
to
pass
thou
shalt
see
the
confusion
of
thine
enemies
for
the
honor
of
israel
shall
this
day
be
vindicated
right
gloriously
as
for
the
thing
that
thou
hast
spoken
of
it
shall
be
even
as
thou
hast
said
there
is
no
lack
of
them
that
can
witness
against
this
man
ay
and
that
will
witness
right
gladly
for
the
glory
of
jehovah
surely
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
say
who
will
come
up
to
the
help
of
the
lord
to
the
help
of
the
lord
against
the
mighty
israel
shall
arise
in
her
might
and
shall
gird
herself
against
them
that
would
do
her
violence
that
would
plague
her
with
idolatrous
and
blasphemous
practices
too
long
have
we
held
our
peace
in
the
presence
of
this
devouring
evil
the
very
stones
of
the
temple
will
cry
out
if
we
longer
submit
to
them
that
profane
its
sanctity
as
in
the
case
of
the
nazarene
it
will
be
possible
to
do
nothing
of
ourselves
said
saul
bitterly
and
the
romans
they
care
for
none
of
these
things
ah
there
we
have
gained
a
signal
victory
over
our
enemies
said
annas
triumphantly
herod
is
with
us
this
time
though
not
openly
i
have
taken
good
care
that
reports
should
reach
his
ear
from
time
to
time
how
that
these
fellows
continually
proclaim
the
return
of
the
crucified
one
to
reign
over
israel
he
loves
his
paltry
throne
and
actually
fears
that
the
thing
may
come
to
pass
not
many
days
since
he
sent
for
me
he
was
lying
at
full
length
among
his
purple
cushions
hast
thou
heard
what
these
galileans
are
saying
he
said
scarcely
tarrying
for
the
accustomed
greetings
they
are
saying
many
things
that
are
unlawful
i
answered
him
but
nothing
more
dangerous
to
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
nation
than
that
the
dead
malefactor
whom
they
claim
is
alive
will
shortly
return
to
rule
over
dost
thou
believe
that
the
man
is
alive
he
asked
fixing
his
eyes
upon
me
if
he
be
not
alive
i
said
the
sedition
is
none
the
less
to
be
feared
for
these
fellows
are
capable
of
forcing
the
people
to
believe
what
they
will
wilt
thou
not
then
take
measures
against
them
who
alone
art
in
power
i
can
not
he
whined
fretfully
i
fear
the
people
i
fear
the
man
the
the
dead
man
i
am
not
well
hast
thou
not
a
law
which
will
stop
their
prating
we
have
a
law
yes
i
made
him
answer
but
we
can
not
enforce
it
since
the
law
the
law
he
interrupted
the
law
is
this
he
that
blasphemeth
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
and
all
the
congregation
shall
certainly
stone
him
the
stranger
as
well
as
he
that
is
born
in
the
land
when
he
blasphemeth
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
put
to
carry
out
your
law
upon
these
men
he
cried
throwing
himself
back
upon
the
cushions
not
so
i
answered
lest
we
fall
upon
evil
times
afterward
we
be
in
all
points
civil
as
well
as
religious
and
it
is
not
lawful
for
us
to
put
any
man
to
there
shall
no
harm
come
to
thee
he
cried
i
swear
it
there
is
now
no
governor
in
jerusalem
i
am
a
roman
i
am
the
give
me
a
warrant
sealed
with
thy
seal
i
said
and
he
gave
it
straightway
hast
thou
this
writing
with
thee
said
saul
annas
drew
a
parchment
from
his
bosom
and
gave
it
into
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
young
man
without
a
word
inasmuch
he
read
aloud
as
the
peace
of
jerusalem
and
all
judæa
is
endangered
by
malicious
persons
who
proclaim
that
a
crucified
malefactor
to
wit
one
jesus
of
nazareth
is
alive
and
will
shortly
overturn
the
present
government
that
he
may
himself
rule
and
as
these
persons
moreover
blasphemously
affirm
that
said
malefactor
is
the
messiah
i
herod
do
empower
the
senate
of
the
people
of

called
also
the
sanhedrim
to
deal
with
such
seditious
persons
according
to
their
judgment
and
after
their
laws
which
do
fully
provide
for
the
scourging
imprisonment
and
putting
to
death
of
all
persons
whether
hebrew
or
alien
who

affirm

declare
mischievous
doctrines
of
the

and
sealed
to

glory
of

and
the
peace
of
the
nation
this
fifth
day
of
nisan
in
the
asmonean
palace
god
hath
given
them
into
our
hand
my
son
said
annas
solemnly
we
must
deal
with
them
even
as
elijah
dealt
with
the
prophets
of
baal
and
let
not
one
of
them
chapter
xxvi
until
the
day
break
in
the
morning
of
that
same
day
before
it
was
yet
dawn
stephen
arose
and
went
away
out
of
the
city
after
the
supreme
renunciation
of
the
night
before
he
had
experienced
a
strange
a
wonderful
peace
the
world
had
vanished
from
out
his
sight
he
felt
that
he
had
already
entered
upon
the
life
beyond
and
while
he
yet
marvelled
and
rejoiced
because
of
this
he
slept
how
many
hours
had
elapsed
before
he
awoke
he
did
not
know
it
was
dark
in
the
and
the
darkness
lay
heavily
upon
him
like
a
pall
with
the
darkness
there
had
also
fallen
the
icy
shadow
of
his
approaching
doom
before
the
shrouded
face
of
this
awful
impalpable
presence
peace
and
joy
fled
away
in
affright
he
strove
to
pray
but
his
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
near
by
he
could
hear
the
regular
peaceful
breathing
of
john
and
andrew
somehow
the
sound
added
an
intolerable
poignancy
to
his
anguish
for
the
first
time
he
realized
to
the
full
the
utter
loneliness
of
the
soul
they
love
me
he
said
within
himself
bitterly
but
they
sleep
after
a
time
he
arose
and
wrapping
his
cloak
about
him
stole
out
into
the
courtyard
the
fresh
wind
as
it
smote
him
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
relief
the
stars
glittered
keenly
overhead
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
heavens
the
fragrance
of
a
tall
white
lily
abloom
beside
the
little
cistern
hung
heavy
upon
the
air
an
irresistible
impulse
to
go
swiftly
somewhere
anywhere
came
upon
him
undoing
the
fastening
of
the
outer
door
he
slipped
out
feeling
a
quick
thrill
of
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
he
had
accomplished
this
noiselessly
the
cocks
were
crowing
as
he
started
swiftly
down
the
street
first
one
then
another
then
half
a
dozen
at
once
dying
away
into
silence
only
to
break
forth
again
as
some
faint
challenge
from
a
distance
rang
out
triumphantly
as
yet
there
was
little
token
of
day
but
the
keeper
was
drowsily
undoing
the
fastenings
of
the
city
gate
in
due
anticipation
of
the
who
would
soon
be
coming
from
every
quarter
stephen
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
slipped
through
the
opening
without
being
observed
before
him
lay
the
roman
road
hard
and
white
stretching
dimly
away
into
the
darkness
all
the
young
life
in
him
leapt
up
at
the
sight
i
have
but
to
follow
this
road
he
thought
it
will
bring
me
to
safety
and
why
after
all
should
i
remain
wicked
men
have
laid
a
snare
for
me
and
it
hath
been
made
known
to
me
in
the
mercy
of
god
it
must
needs
be
that
i
escape
i
am
young
i
can
and
will
do
good
service
to
them
that
believe
for
many
years
what
shall
it
profit
any
man
if
i
perish
now
he
was
walking
the
more
swiftly
as
he
communed
thus
with
himself
and
hearing
or
fancying
that
he
heard
a
sound
as
of
pursuit
behind
him
he
thrust
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
ran
the
road
still
dimly
unrolling
itself
out
of
the
darkness
before
him
like
a
dusky
ribbon
from
the
loom
of
night
after
he
had
gone
thus
for
a
long
distance
his
breath
being
spent
and
his
laboring
heart
knocking
loudly
for
relief
he
paused
and
withdrawing
his
fingers
from
his
ears
listened
there
was
no
sound
save
the
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
gnarled
branches
of
the
trees
and
the
shrilling
of
insects
in
the
lush
grass
he
sank
down
for
a
moment
to
rest
if
i
go
away
now
as
indeed
those
older
and
wiser
than
myself
have
advised
i
can
remain
till
the
present
danger
be
passed
afterward
i
can
return
and
there
is
anat
the
world
is
wide
there
is
no
need
that
we
remain
at
jerusalem
we
two
will
go
away
into
far
countries
and
among
strange
peoples
that
we
may
spread
the
gospel
among
all
nations
even
as
the
master
commanded
it
is
right
that
this
should
be
else
why
do
these
thoughts
come
to
me
as
for
means
for
my
journey
i
have
here
in
my
pouch
the
money
with
which
i
was
to
buy
provisions
this
would
the
apostles
gladly
give
me
for
my
present
needs
ay
and
more
yes
i
will
go
i
must
go
and
he
arose
and
girding
himself
resolutely
started
once
more
upon
his
journey
i
will
go
he
repeated
to
himself
more
than
once
i
must
go
but
after
a
time
he
ceased
to
walk
swiftly
at
length
he
stopped
altogether
and
turned
his
face
toward
the
east
faint
rosy
flushes
momently
brightening
merged
finally
into
long
tremulous
beams
of
pure
unearthly
light
which
shot
up
as
if
in
an
ecstasy
of
triumph
over
the
conquered
gloom
stephen
s
heart
expanded
at
the
sight
he
sank
upon
his
knees
blessed
art
thou
o
lord
our
god
king
of
the
universe
he
murmured
aloud
who
createst
light
and
formest
darkness
who
makest
peace
and
createst
all
things
he
in
mercy
causes
the
light
to
shine
upon
the
earth
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
in
goodness
renews
every
day
the
work
of
creation
blessed
art
thou
the
creator
of
light
something
in
the
familiar
and
words
spoken
in
that
dewy
solitude
seemed
to
sweep
away
the
paralyzing
and
unworthy
fear
from
out
his
soul
he
looked
at
the
roman
road
showing
hard
white
and
dusty
in
the
morning
light
it
no
longer
appeared
alluring
he
thought
again
of
his
resolve
to
use
the
money
from
the
almoner
s
fund
to
make
good
his
escape
and
the
honest
crimson
rose
to
his
cheek
i
am
no
better
than
a
thief
he
cried
aloud
i
will
go
back
and
if
it
needs
be
that
i
suffer
god
help
me
for
the
flesh
is
weak
as
he
arose
to
his
feet
he
saw
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
he
had
paused
near
to
the
little
rocky
knoll
called
from
its
strange
resemblance
to
a
human
skull
golgotha
upon
the
bald
summit
of
this
place
of
death
stood
a
cross
and
upon
the
cross
hung
the
figure
of
a
man
naked
save
for
his
scanty
rags
which
fluttered
fitfully
in
the
light
breeze
the
clear
light
of
the
dawn
revealing
with
ghastly
insistency
his
drawn
features
and
the
purple
wounds
in
his
hands
and
feet
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
lay
two
roman
soldiers
evidently
detailed
to
watch
the
dying
man
they
were
snoring
loudly
a
upon
the
grass
between
them
revealing
the
manner
in
which
they
had
beguiled
the
night
watches
as
stephen
gazed
at
this
horrible
sight
the
figure
on
the
cross
writhed
feebly
the
blue
lips
parted
god
daylight
again
and
i
live
live
were
the
words
which
gushed
out
from
them
in
a
quavering
shriek
sick
with
a
fear
that
he
could
not
control
stephen
approached
the
cross
treading
carefully
lest
he
should
awaken
the
brutal
sleepers
at
its
foot
water
cried
the
sufferer
yes
i
see
it
a
brown
stream
running
over
its
pebbles
a
lake
deep
and
cool
i
will
hide
in
it
my
hands
are
burning
no
no
they
are
dead
here
is
water
said
stephen
in
a
trembling
voice
holding
his
flask
to
the
lips
of
the
dying
wretch
for
he
hung
low
his
feet
almost
touching
the
ground
but
the
man
could
not
drink
he
opened
his
glazing
eyes
apparently
not
seeing
the
face
of
angelic
pity
at
his
side
for
he
fell
to
babbling
disconnectedly
of
many
things
mingling
frightful
curses
on
his
tormentors
with
prayers
to
the
pagan
gods
stephen
sent
up
a
swift
prayer
for
help
he
could
pray
now
listen
he
cried
not
heeding
the
fact
that
a
group
of
wayfarers
had
stopped
and
were
regarding
him
with
amazement
listen
thou
mayest
yet
be
saved
jesus
of
nazareth
can
save
thee
master
hear
i
beseech
thee
and
save
the
dim
eyes
were
turned
upon
him
now
there
was
a
gleam
of
understanding
in
them
art
thou
jesus
of
nazareth
nay
i
am
but
his
servant
call
upon
him
quickly
to
forgive
to
save
jesus
forgive
save
gasped
the
failing
voice
then
all
was
still
stephen
looked
once
into
the
quiet
face
of
the
man
on
the
cross
then
down
at
the
soldiers
who
were
beginning
to
stir
a
little
one
of
them
sat
up
and
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
and
yawned
by
bacchus
he
exclaimed
i
must
have
slept
a
murrain
on
these
night
watches
the
fellow
could
not
have
gotten
away
then
his
eye
fell
upon
stephen
who
art
thou
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
and
what
art
thou
doing
here
if
now
thou
hast
meddled
with
the
malefactor
ha
the
fellow
is
gone
didst
thou
give
him
aught
to
help
him
to
his
death
no
friend
answered
stephen
quietly
i
but
spoke
to
him
of
jesus
the
redeemer
and
if
god
will
that
word
hath
helped
him
to
eternal
life
the
man
to
whom
he
had
spoken
made
a
motion
as
if
to
seize
him
but
the
other
who
had
also
awakened
held
him
back
let
be
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
hath
done
no
harm
tis
stephen
the
nazarene
the
soldier
dropped
his
arm
go
he
commanded
briefly
we
had
orders
to
allow
no
one
near
the
cross
of
this
man
stephen
bowed
his
head
and
passed
on
he
walked
swiftly
as
he
had
done
before
the
dawn
but
this
time
his
face
was
steadfastly
set
towards
jerusalem
and
upon
it
shone
the
light
of
a
peace
which
the
world
had
not
given
and
which
from
henceforth
it
was
powerless
to
take
away
verily
when
the
day
breaks
the
shadows
flee
away
chapter
xxvii
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
do
thou
ben
obed
watch
the
man
till
such
time
as
i
shall
send
thee
word
then
thou
art
known
unto
him
a
fortunate
chance
say
this
to
him
there
is
one
ailing
at
my
house
who
desireth
thy
immediate
he
will
at
once
follow
thee
and
thou
shalt
fetch
him
without
delay
into
the
council
chamber
suppose
that
he
will
not
follow
me
said
the
young
man
fixing
his
black
eyes
upon
the
floor
with
a
somewhat
sullen
expression
caleb
looked
at
him
keenly
for
a
moment
before
replying
if
thou
art
zealous
to
secure
for
thyself
the
position
whereof
i
have
spoken
and
the
sum
of
silver
which
shall
also
be
the
reward
of
thy
diligence
thou
wilt
not
lack
means
to
bring
the
man
away
from
the
multitude
without
exciting
any
tumult
it
is
not
expedient
for
me
to
appear
in
this
matter
else
would
i
undertake
it
but
thou
art
not
the
only
one
there
is
malluch
or
i
will
fetch
him
said
ben
obed
looking
up
hastily
have
i
not
said
that
i
would
do
it
the
reward
is
sure
pursued
caleb
and
thou
wilt
have
moreover
the
approval
of
thine
own
conscience
in
the
matter
in
that
thou
art
in
serving
thine
own
interests
also
serving
god
and
doubt
not
that
thine
obedience
will
be
as
a
sweet
savor
before
him
what
will
they
do
with
the
with
stephen
asked
the
young
man
shifting
uneasily
about
in
his
place
he
is
that
is
i
think
and
he
stopped
short
his
eyes
fixed
eagerly
on
the
face
of
his
superior
caleb
straightened
himself
and
his
face
hardened
i
have
not
asked
the
question
of
them
above
me
in
authority
to
receive
an
order
and
to
obey
it
without
question
comment
or
opinion
hath
ever
been
my
way
it
should
also
be
thy
way
if
thou
hast
a
desire
to
advance
thyself
in
life
as
also
it
is
written
seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
business
he
shall
stand
before
this
have
i
done
not
once
but
many
times
and
the
speaker
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
passed
his
beard
through
his
hand
with
the
same
impressive
gesture
that
he
had
observed
many
times
and
admired
in
the
lordly
annas
go
now
young
man
he
continued
and
acquit
thyself
well
as
becometh
the
son
of
a
wise
and
diligent
man
so
shall
thy
mother
rejoice
in
the
day
of
thy
birth
they
will
imprison
him
muttered
iddo
ben
obed
to
himself
as
he
turned
away
he
hath
assuredly
spoken
contrary
to
the
law
and
why
should
i
not
witness
to
the
truth
a
man
must
faithfully
perform
the
duties
whereunto
he
is
called
without
partiality
this
stephen
is
a
greek
at
least
by
his
father
and
is
it
lawful
to
set
the
son
of
a
malefactor
in
a
place
of
authority
i
say
not
if
he
were
once
out
of
the
way
i
could
win
the
maid
anat
i
know
that
i
could
i
can
give
her
a
home
and
abundance
of
all
that
she
hath
need
of
i
will
do
this
thing
he
hath
brought
it
upon
himself
for
i
have
thrice
warned
him
to
leave
jerusalem
he
will
not
leave
and
why
he
thinks
forsooth
that
i
am
blind
and
having
come
to
the
place
where
the
daily
distributions
were
wont
to
be
made
he
mingled
with
the
multitude
and
waited
for
the
appearance
of
the
seven
as
the
deacons
were
now
commonly
called
they
appeared
at
last
laden
with
the
day
s
alms
and
began
to
make
distribution
among
the
waiting
poor
iddo
noticed
that
stephen
s
face
was
very
pale
and
that
blue
shadows
lay
beneath
his
dark
eyes
he
smiled
evilly
he
is
afraid
he
sneered
and
being
now
determined
upon
the
course
which
he
meant
to
follow
he
allowed
his
jealous
hatred
of
the
man
to
spring
up
unchecked
and
because
hatred
is
a
plant
of
quick
and
easy
growth
especially
when
nourished
by
envy
it
came
to
pass
that
within
the
half
hour
ben
obed
had
seen
every
trace
of
love
justice
and
pity
in
his
soul
quite
destroyed
i
hate
him
he
whispered
to
himself
clenching
his
fists
i
care
not
what
they
do
with
him
i
hate
him
the
distribution
took
an
unusually
long
time
that
morning
and
iddo
noticed
with
a
scowl
how
that
all
the
poor
widows
and
little
children
lingered
for
a
word
with
the
youngest
of
the
seven
stephen
the
of
the
poor
as
he
was
often
called
hypocrite
said
iddo
beneath
his
breath
as
he
uttered
the
word
he
was
startled
to
feel
a
light
touch
on
his
shoulder
turning
quickly
his
eye
fell
upon
the
messenger
appointed
by
caleb
tis
the
time
said
the
man
with
a
wink
bring
him
outside
now
i
will
be
at
hand
should
you
need
help
ben
obed
nodded
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
the
hatred
had
grown
so
mighty
that
it
struggled
to
cry
out
he
approached
stephen
cautiously
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
there
is
one
who
is
ailing
at
my
house
he
said
with
difficulty
wilt
thou
come
with
me
stephen
looked
up
with
a
smile
peace
be
with
thee
ben
obed
and
to
all
that
are
within
thy
house
yes
i
will
come
with
thee
but
let
me
first
speak
with
this
woman
who
hath
patiently
waited
for
me
since
the
beginning
of
the
distribution
what
is
it
that
thou
wouldst
ask
of
me
woman
i
have
brought
hither
my
babe
answered
the
woman
in
a
low
anxious
voice
he
doth
not
wake
and
smile
on
me
as
formerly
but
only
sleeps
surely
it
is
not
well
with
him
if
he
sleep
he
shall
do
well
said
stephen
unconsciously
quoting
the
words
of
his
master
when
told
of
the
sickness
of
lazarus
and
if
god
will
that
he
wake
in
heaven
then
wouldst
thou
have
a
child
growing
to
manhood
among
the
angels
dost
thou
not
covet
this
for
thy
child
nay
for
i
love
him
too
much
to
wish
him
out
of
my
arms
said
the
mother
dashing
the
bright
drops
from
her
eyes
and
i
have
not
seen
heaven
my
business
with
thee
is
urgent
whispered
ben
obed
imperatively
stephen
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
child
s
head
thy
will
concerning
this
little
one
be
done
o
father
in
the
name
of
jesus
but
thou
hast
not
asked
for
his
healing
cried
the
mother
i
have
asked
for
the
best
that
heaven
holds
for
him
or
for
any
one
of
us
said
stephen
gently
but
see
thy
child
hath
awakened
then
he
turned
to
ben
obed
i
will
go
with
thee
he
said
simply
but
there
was
that
in
his
eyes
that
caused
iddo
to
drop
his
own
to
the
earth
once
on
the
street
stephen
walked
swiftly
so
swiftly
that
ben
obed
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
him
he
exchanged
glances
with
the
messenger
of
caleb
who
was
following
at
a
discreet
distance
and
the
man
rapidly
overtook
them
we
will
go
this
way
said
ben
obed
in
a
hard
voice
but
stephen
was
silent
something
in
his
still
face
angered
the
young
man
at
his
side
beyond
control
why
dost
thou
not
speak
he
cried
in
a
choked
voice
scarce
knowing
what
he
said
there
are
times
when
silence
is
more
excellent
than
speech
said
stephen
ben
obed
cursed
the
temple
under
his
breath
then
he
grasped
his
companion
by
the
arm
at
least
i
am
not
a
hypocrite
he
said
violently
i
have
been
commanded
to
fetch
thee
before
the
council
of
the
sanhedrim
that
thou
mayest
answer
for
thy
heresies
and
i
am
going
to
do
my
duty
lay
not
the
consequences
of
thine
own
despicable
folly
at
my
door
i
had
not
expected
this
at
thy
hands
said
stephen
with
a
look
of
full
understanding
i
had
rather
that
it
had
been
another
but
it
matters
not
there
was
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
ben
obed
laughed
aloud
thou
wouldst
rather
that
it
were
another
for
then
mightest
thou
hope
to
escape
but
it
is
not
another
it
is
i
ben
obed
and
because
thou
hast
cheated
me
out
of
the
woman
i
love
i
hate
thee
stephen
was
silent
the
twain
followed
by
the
messenger
presently
came
to
the
temple
enclosure
without
a
word
ben
obed
hurried
his
companion
through
the
crowded
courts
neither
heeding
the
curious
looks
with
which
they
were
regarded
till
at
length
they
stood
before
the
closed
door
of
the
great
chamber
of
council
called
also
the
hall
of
squares
caleb
with
a
detachment
of
temple
police
stood
on
guard
he
was
looking
anxious
and
worn
but
his
eye
brightened
as
it
fell
upon
stephen
motioning
to
the
guard
to
close
in
around
the
prisoner
he
himself
listened
at
the
closed
door
presently
he
laid
a
cautious
hand
upon
the
fastening
and
with
an
air
of
deep
solemnity
introduced
his
head
into
the
sacred
apartment
apparently
receiving
some
signal
from
within
he
immediately
withdrew
it
pass
in
he
said
briskly
laying
a
compelling
hand
upon
stephen
s
shoulder
there
was
an
awful
stillness
in
the
great
room
as
the
two
entered
followed
by
the
lesser
officers
who
ranged
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
accused
man
then
a
murmur
ran
about
the
circle
at
the
sound
stephen
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
calmly
about
him
these
were
the
men
who
had
slain
his
lord
they
would
also
slay
him
he
knew
it
and
yet
the
knowledge
brought
with
it
only
a
singular
joy
they
hate
me
because
i
am
like
him
he
said
within
himself
and
the
glory
of
that
thought
became
visible
upon
his
face
jonathan
the
high
priest
was
speaking
now
with
an
effort
the
prisoner
compelled
himself
to
listen
thou
art
arraigned
before
this
sacred
assembly
and
senate
of
israel
on
the
charge
of
blasphemously
speaking
against
jehovah
against
this
most
holy
temple
and
against
the
laws
and
institutions
of
moses
and
of
the
prophets
ordained
by
jehovah
to
speak
his
pleasure
to
the
children
of
men
we
shall
hear
these
charges
confirmed
by
witnesses
according
to
our
laws
which
thou
hast
despised
but
which
thou
shalt
tread
under
foot
no
longer
with
impunity
fetch
the
first
dost
thou
ezek
recognize
in
this
man
that
stephen
who
hath
blasphemed
god
the
temple
and
the
law
i
do
most
worshipful
and
high
priest
of
jehovah
this
is
the
man
tell
us
now
what
thou
hast
heard
him
say
i
have
heard
him
say
that
the
malefactor
jesus
of
nazareth
who
of
late
died
the
accursed
death
after
having
been
duly
and
righteously
convicted
of
his
crimes
before
this
most
sacred
council
i
have
heard
him
declare
that
this
man
was
jehovah
made
manifest
in
the
flesh
and
that
therefore
his
precepts
and
commands
are
more
binding
than
the
precepts
of
moses
who
was
a
sinful
man
like
unto
ourselves
hast
thou
heard
him
say
aught
concerning
the
temple
i
have
heard
him
say
that
the
nazarene
shall
shortly
return
to
destroy
this
place
so
that
not
one
stone
shall
remain
upon
another
and
that
all
things
which
moses
commanded
shall
be
done
away
the
gentiles
moreover
and
them
that
are
alien
shall
see
these
things
and
rejoice
for
that
this
jesus
shall
hereafter
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
gather
his
elect
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
the
nazarenes
have
the
intent
moreover
to
possess
the
earth
and
to
overthrow
all
powers
and
governments
and
all
gods
that
have
ever
ruled
among
men
to
the
end
that
they
may
establish
the
man
jesus
upon
the
throne
of
power
didst
thou
hear
the
man
declare
these
things
i
did
most
sacred
high
priest
enough
iddo
ben
obed
thou
mayest
stand
forth
dost
thou
know
this
man
i
do
my
lord
stephen
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
this
voice
and
a
keen
spasm
of
pain
swept
across
his
face
look
at
him
whispered
issachar
to
his
neighbor
he
evidently
fears
this
witness
more
than
the
other
though
his
testimony
was
sufficiently
damning
and
what
hast
thou
to
say
concerning
him
continued
the
monotonous
voice
of
the
high
priest
he
hath
spoken
blasphemously
against
moses
and
against
this
holy
place
even
as
hath
already
been
said
in
your
hearing
declaring
that
god
regardeth
neither
this
temple
nor
the
holy
city
of
jerusalem
inasmuch
as
the
lord
jesus
did
in
his
lifetime
pronounce
against
them
anathema
he
also
hold
how
is
it
that
thou
dost
call
the
nazarene
lord
art
thou
also
one
of
them
the
witness
turned
pale
he
cast
a
murderous
look
at
stephen
no
he
said
fiercely
i
but
repeat
the
word
which
these
men
make
use
of
in
their
blasphemous
harangues
to
the
people
the
words
slipped
from
me
unawares
proceed
he
hath
declared
that
neither
by
laws
of
man
s
devising
nor
by
temples
of
man
s
building
can
jehovah
be
pleased
that
all
these
things
shall
be
brought
to
naught
but
that
the
words
of
the
nazarene
shall
remain
enough
there
is
no
need
for
further
testimony
let
the
accused
stand
forth
stephen
obeyed
and
all
that
sat
in
the
council
looking
steadfastly
on
him
saw
his
face
as
it
had
been
the
face
of
an
angel
chapter
xxviii
the
lifted
veil
then
said
the
high
priest
after
the
manner
of
the
formal
procedure
are
these
things
so
and
stephen
looking
about
on
the
seventy
men
before
whom
he
stood
the
heads
and
leaders
of
that
forlorn
remnant
of
the
chosen
people
desolate
because
of
their
rebellion
against
the
god
who
had
borne
with
them
so
long
and
patiently
was
moved
to
bring
again
the
wonderful
promises
of
jehovah
to
their
minds
so
plain
did
it
all
appear
to
him
filled
as
he
was
with
that
spirit
of
light
which
the
lord
had
vouchsafed
according
to
his
word
and
which
he
had
also
promised
to
pour
out
freely
upon
all
men
a
glorious
hope
was
stirring
in
his
breast
as
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
stern
faces
before
him
hatred
indeed
and
stubborn
he
saw
written
thereon
but
what
could
stand
before
the
spirit
of
truth
what
if
it
should
be
granted
him
to
mightily
convince
these
men
to
see
perchance
some
such
glorious
exhibition
of
god
s
grace
as
had
been
manifested
at
pentecost
men
brethren
and
fathers
hearken
he
began
and
at
the
sound
of
that
inspired
voice
every
eye
was
fastened
upon
him
the
god
of
glory
appeared
unto
our
father
abraham
and
said
unto
him
get
thee
out
of
thy
land
and
from
thy
kindred
and
come
into
the
land
which
i
shall
show
then
came
he
out
of
the
land
of
the
chaldæans
and
dwelt
in
haran
and
from
thence
when
his
father
was
dead
god
removed
him
into
this
land
wherein
ye
now
dwell
he
gave
him
no
inheritance
in
it
not
even
so
much
as
to
set
his
foot
upon
but
he
promised
that
he
would
give
it
to
him
and
to
the
generations
after
him
when
as
yet
he
had
no
child
and
god
spake
thus
unto
him
thy
children
shall
sojourn
in
a
strange
land
and
they
shall
be
enslaved
and
evil
entreated
for
the
space
of
four
hundred
years
but
the
nation
which
hath
persecuted
them
i
will
judge
i
jehovah
have
declared
it
and
after
that
shall
thy
children
come
forth
out
of
bondage
and
they
shall
serve
me
in
this
and
he
gave
him
the
covenant
of
circumcision
and
so
abraham
after
that
isaac
was
born
circumcised
him
on
the
eighth
day
and
to
isaac
in
due
time
was
born
jacob
jacob
also
had
twelve
sons
whom
we
call
the
patriarchs
and
the
patriarchs
moved
with
jealousy
against
joseph
their
brother
sold
him
into
egypt
nevertheless
god
was
with
him
and
delivered
him
out
of
all
his
afflictions
and
gave
him
favor
and
wisdom
before
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
insomuch
that
pharaoh
made
him
governor
over
all
the
land
now
there
came
a
mighty
famine
which
extended
throughout
all
egypt
and
canaan
and
the
people
were
wasted
by
it
our
fathers
also
had
no
food
but
jacob
hearing
that
there
was
corn
in
egypt
sent
forth
his
sons
to
fetch
some
and
when
that
was
consumed
which
they
brought
they
went
again
the
second
time
and
joseph
made
himself
known
unto
his
brethren
and
he
brought
them
into
the
presence
of
pharaoh
after
that
joseph
sent
for
jacob
his
father
and
for
all
his
kindred
numbering
in
all
three
score
and
fifteen
souls
they
went
therefore
into
the
land
of
egypt
and
jacob
died
there
and
in
due
time
the
patriarchs
our
fathers
also
and
they
were
buried
in
shechem
in
the
land
which
abraham
had
bought
for
a
burial
place
but
as
the
time
of
the
promise
drew
nigh
which
god
had
given
unto
abraham
the
people
grew
and
multiplied
till
there
arose
another
king
over
egypt
which
knew
not
joseph
the
new
king
dealt
deceitfully
with
our
nation
wickedly
compelling
our
fathers
that
they
should
cast
out
their
babes
to
die
at
this
time
moses
was
born
and
he
was
beautiful
in
the
sight
of
god
three
months
was
he
nourished
in
his
father
s
house
and
when
he
was
cast
out
pharaoh
s
daughter
rescued
him
and
brought
him
up
as
her
own
son
so
moses
was
instructed
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
and
he
became
mighty
in
word
and
deed
now
when
he
was
well
nigh
forty
years
of
age
it
came
into
his
heart
to
visit
his
brethren
the
children
of
israel
and
seeing
one
of
them
suffer
wrong
he
defended
him
and
avenged
him
that
was
oppressed
smiting
the
egyptian
that
he
died
supposing
that
his
brethren
would
understand
how
that
god
by
his
hand
was
giving
them
deliverance
but
they
understood
not
and
the
day
following
he
came
again
upon
two
of
them
at
strife
and
urged
them
to
be
at
peace
saying
sirs
ye
are
brethren
why
do
ye
wrong
one
another
but
he
that
did
his
neighbor
wrong
thrust
him
away
saying
who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
over
us
wouldst
thou
kill
me
as
thou
didst
kill
the
egyptian
yesterday
and
moses
fled
at
this
saying
and
became
an
exile
in
the
land
of
midian
here
he
took
to
himself
a
wife
and
two
sons
were
born
to
him
and
when
forty
years
had
passed
an
angel
appeared
to
him
as
he
wandered
one
day
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
and
the
angel
was
as
a
burning
flame
of
fire
in
a
bush
of
the
mountain
the
bush
burned
yet
was
not
consumed
when
moses
saw
it
he
wondered
at
the
sight
and
as
he
drew
near
to
behold
there
came
a
voice
of
the
lord
saying
i
am
the
god
of
thy
fathers
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
isaac
and
of
then
moses
trembled
and
hid
his
face
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
loose
the
shoes
from
thy
feet
for
the
place
whereon
thou
standest
is
holy
ground
i
have
surely
seen
the
affliction
of
my
people
which
are
in
egypt
and
have
heard
their
groaning
and
i
am
come
down
to
deliver
them
now
come
i
will
send
thee
into
so
it
came
to
pass
that
this
very
moses
whom
the
people
of
israel
had
refused
saying
who
made
thee
a
ruler
and
a
judge
god
sent
to
be
both
a
ruler
and
a
deliverer
by
the
hand
of
the
angel
which
appeared
to
him
in
the
bush
and
this
man
moses
led
the
israelites
forth
working
great
signs
and
wonders
in
egypt
and
in
the
red
sea
and
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
forty
years
this
is
that
moses
which
said
unto
the
children
of
israel
a
prophet
shall
god
raise
up
unto
you
from
among
your
brethren
like
unto
this
is
that
moses
that
was
with
the
people
in
the
wilderness
with
the
angel
which
spake
to
him
in
the
mount
of
sinai
who
also
received
the
law
at
the
hands
of
the
living
god
to
give
unto
us
but
our
fathers
refused
him
their
obedience
and
thrust
him
away
from
them
turning
back
in
their
hearts
unto
egypt
and
saying
unto
aaron
make
us
gods
which
shall
go
before
us
for
as
for
this
moses
which
led
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
then
made
they
for
themselves
a
golden
calf
and
brought
a
sacrifice
unto
the
idol
rejoicing
in
the
works
of
their
hands
but
god
turned
and
gave
them
up
to
serve
the
host
of
heaven
as
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
the
prophets
did
ye
offer
unto
me
slain
beasts
and
sacrifices
forty
years
in
the
wilderness
o
house
of
israel
and
afterward
ye
took
up
the
tabernacle
of
moloch
and
the
star
of
the
god
rephan
the
figures
which
ye
made
to
worship
them
i
will
carry
you
away
beyond
our
fathers
had
the
tabernacle
of
the
testimony
in
the
wilderness
according
to
the
covenant
of
god
unto
moses
who
fashioned
it
like
unto
the
figure
that
was
revealed
unto
him
this
tabernacle
also
our
fathers
brought
into
the
promised
land
when
they
entered
it
with
joshua
god
thrusting
out
the
heathen
nations
from
before
their
faces
and
in
it
they
worshipped
unto
the
days
of
david
who
finding
favor
in
the
sight
of
god
asked
that
he
might
build
a
habitation
for
the
god
of
jacob
and
solomon
his
son
built
a
temple
howbeit
the
most
high
dwelleth
not
in
houses
made
with
hands
as
saith
the
prophet
the
heaven
is
my
throne
and
the
earth
the
footstool
of
my
feet
what
manner
of
house
will
ye
build
me
saith
the
lord
or
what
is
the
place
of
my
rest
did
not
my
hands
make
all
things
here
the
speaker
paused
and
looked
about
upon
the
faces
of
his
audience
some
were
sneering
outright
others
whispering
to
their
neighbors
while
others
still
regarded
him
with
looks
of
malignant
hatred
not
one
of
all
the
seventy
had
apprehended
his
meaning
he
thought
bitterly
not
one
cared
for
his
words
of
what
use
to
continue
the
sublime
retrospect
a
wave
of
fiery
indignation
swept
away
the
last
remnant
of
fear
and
in
a
voice
ringing
with
inspired
passion
he
burst
out
ye
and
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
ears
ye
do
always
resist
the
holy
spirit
as
your
fathers
did
so
do
ye
which
of
the
prophets
did
not
your
fathers
persecute
and
they
killed
them
which
showed
before
of
the
coming
of
the
righteous
one
of
whom
ye
have
now
become
the
betrayers
and
murderers
ye
who
received
the
law
as
it
was
ordained
by
angels
and
kept
it
not
for
an
instant
there
was
a
breathless
silence
that
mighty
arrow
tipped
with
a
living
fire
had
found
lodgment
in
every
heart
then
a
low
murderous
hiss
ran
about
the
circle
with
one
accord
the
assembly
rose
to
their
feet
but
some
invisible
power
held
them
back
stephen
the
despised
follower
of
the
crucified
nazarene
was
looking
up
steadfastly
angels
had
lifted
for
him
the
dark
veil
of
mortality
the
hall
of
judgment
and
the
faces
of
his
infuriated
judges
faded
from
before
his
eyes
he
saw
instead
the
unspeakable
glories
of
the
new
jerusalem
god
enthroned
amid
innumerable
companies
of
angels
and
jesus
standing
with
outstretched
hands
to
receive
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
he
cried
out
behold
i
see
the
heavens
opened
and
the
son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
only
a
glimpse
but
what
mattered
it
now
to
him
that
the
dark
flood
of
hatred
had
broken
loose
and
was
sweeping
him
away
with
wild
tumult
towards
certain
death
he
did
not
see
the
infuriated
mob
of
his
executioners
he
scarce
realized
that
he
was
being
dragged
through
the
streets
followed
by
a
yelling
multitude
roused
from
their
apathy
by
the
familiar
scent
of
blood
beyond
the
gates
it
is
the
law
this
is
the
place
here
are
stones
in
abundance
quick
or
the
nazarenes
will
be
to
the
rescue
let
the
witnesses
cast
the
first
stones
it
is
the
law
well
thrown
esek
again
here
is
a
larger
one
now
the
other
quickly
but
the
other
witness
with
face
as
white
as
that
of
the
dying
man
had
broken
through
the
circle
and
fled
away
shrieking
towards
the
city
my
god
my
god
they
are
killing
him
let
be
the
law
is
fulfilled
quick
or
he
will
yet
be
rescued
the
mob
is
increasing
what
is
that
he
is
saying
for
the
victim
faltering
had
dragged
himself
to
his
knees
lord
jesus
receive
my
spirit
a
shower
of
stones
and
fierce
yells
he
is
sinking
but
again
he
speaks
saul
can
hear
it
for
he
stands
near
guarding
the
garments
of
them
that
are
fulfilling
the
law
they
can
all
hear
for
he
cries
in
a
loud
voice
that
his
murderers
may
remember
it
afterward
for
the
comfort
of
their
guilty
souls
lord
lay
not
this
sin
to
their
charge
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
asleep
chapter
xxix
the
watchful
love
anat
was
spinning
in
the
cool
shadow
of
the
house
the
stones
of
the
little
court
had
been
newly
washed
and
a
refreshing
odor
of
cleanliness
mingled
with
the
fragrance
which
poured
out
from
the
snowy
bells
of
the
lilies
beside
the
cistern
close
to
her
feet
snuggled
the
three
small
brown
children
listening
while
she
sang
after
a
time
the
singer
faltered
a
little
she
was
chanting
the
psalm
of
the
watchful
love
jehovah
is
thy
keeper
jehovah
thy
abode
on
thy
right
hand
the
sun
shall
not
hurt
thee
by
day
neither
the
moon
by
night
she
paused
what
was
that
deep
dull
roar
her
face
paled
a
little
sing
cried
the
boy
imperatively
pulling
at
her
robe
sing
echoed
the
baby
looking
up
at
her
with
his
soft
starry
eyes
as
for
the
little
maiden
she
contented
herself
with
softly
stroking
the
girl
s
sandaled
foot
jehovah
keep
thee
from
all
evil
yes
she
could
surely
hear
a
sound
of
tumult
what
could
it
be
he
will
keep
thy
life
o
my
god
keep
him
keep
him
jehovah
keep
thy
coming
and
thy
going
henceforth
and
forever
the
singer
started
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
the
street
door
had
burst
open
violently
a
man
rushed
in
ghastly
breathless
with
wild
staring
eyes
she
at
first
failed
to
recognize
ben
obed
my
god
they
are
killing
him
where
outside
the
damascus
gate
they
are
stoning
him
anat
stood
for
an
instant
like
some
beautiful
soulless
statue
of
despair
then
a
wild
fire
leapt
to
her
eyes
tell
them
she
said
and
fled
away
out
of
the
open
door
away
away
toward
the
damascus
gate
women
stared
after
her
men
stretched
forth
their
hands
to
grasp
her
but
she
heeded
them
not
her
feet
seemed
leaden
the
minutes
hours
the
damascus
gate
would
she
ever
reach
it
again
and
again
ben
obed
s
awful
cry
sounded
in
her
ears
my
god
they
are
killing
him
the
gate
the
gate
at
last
but
it
is
choked
with
people
coming
in
men
she
dimly
saw
men
with
long
robes
and
broad
phylacteries
men
to
whom
the
did
reverence
while
they
shrank
back
with
involuntary
fear
men
who
drew
away
from
her
white
robe
and
whiter
face
muttering
a
mad
woman
a
mad
dog
at
last
she
has
struggled
through
them
outside
the
damascus
gate
at
last
where
where
yes
yonder
is
a
crowd
it
must
be
there
let
me
through
for
god
s
sake
let
me
through
staring
stupidly
at
her
the
crowd
separated
there
upon
the
ground
under
a
pile
of
stones
lay
something
she
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
pulling
madly
at
the
rough
broken
rock
with
her
delicate
fingers
then
she
gave
a
long
scream
and
fell
forward
in
merciful
unconsciousness
my
daughter
there
was
no
answer
though
the
black
eyes
were
wide
open
mary
hesitated
an
instant
her
sad
lips
moved
in
prayer
anat
my
child
she
said
softly
wilt
thou
not
look
once
more
upon
his
face
before
they
bear
him
hence
i
would
that
thou
see
for
thy
comfort
that
god
hath
set
upon
him
the
visible
seal
of
his
love
in
that
the
peace
that
passeth
understanding
is
writ
thereon
the
girl
rose
feebly
take
me
to
him
she
said
putting
out
her
hand
and
mary
led
her
into
the
peaceful
chamber
where
they
had
laid
him
the
afternoon
sun
shot
long
rays
of
splendor
across
the
face
on
the
pillow
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
youth
and
of
holiness
and
touched
with
the
sublimer
beauty
of
death
the
look
that
he
had
worn
when
he
cried
out
at
sight
of
jesus
waiting
to
receive
him
yet
lingered
there
his
face
was
as
the
face
of
an
angel
who
slept
for
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
murmured
mary
who
stood
at
her
side
at
that
word
the
maiden
turned
and
the
fountain
of
her
tears
broke
forth
and
the
two
wept
together
but
not
as
those
without
hope
and
so
as
the
sad
hours
crept
by
devout
men
carried
forth
the
dead
stephen
to
his
burial
making
great
lamentation
over
him
and
the
poor
to
whom
he
had
daily
ministered
and
them
that
he
had
healed
and
comforted
from
all
the
city
and
the
country
round
about
followed
him
to
the
tomb
and
the
streets
of
the
city
were
filled
with
the
sound
of
the
wailing
and
loud
crying
as
for
the
men
which
had
done
this
thing
they
hid
themselves
and
some
of
them
exulted
because
that
an
enemy
was
dead
and
some
were
ashamed
while
others
still
amongst
them
saul
of
tarsus
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
wailing
and
shook
their
fists
it
is
the
beginning
of
lamentations
for
such
as
blaspheme
the
law
said
these
they
will
forget
this
dead
man
in
the
multitude
of
their
own
distresses
in
the
house
of
john
the
family
sat
that
evening
on
the
as
was
their
wont
and
they
talked
together
of
him
that
had
gone
and
while
they
mourned
indeed
they
also
rejoiced
for
they
knew
that
he
had
fought
a
good
fight
and
that
while
the
hung
dark
and
threatening
above
their
heads
this
beloved
one
had
passed
through
and
beyond
and
was
safe
forever
more
john
remembered
the
words
of
jesus
how
on
that
last
night
he
had
said
to
them
let
not
your
hearts
be
troubled
ye
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
me
in
my
father
s
house
are
many
mansions
if
it
were
not
so
i
would
have
told
you
i
go
to
prepare
a
place
for
you
and
i
will
come
again
and
receive
you
unto
myself
that
where
i
am
there
ye
may
be
also
while
he
yet
spake
another
came
suddenly
into
their
midst
a
ghastly
despairing
figure
his
garments
hanging
in
rags
about
him
his
face
torn
and
bleeding
and
as
they
looked
in
amazement
and
affright
the
man
spoke
and
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
weak
as
of
one
who
had
wept
many
hours
i
am
a
dying
man
he
said
for
i
will
expiate
my
guilt
before
s
sun
rise
upon
the
earth
but
first
i
must
confess
before
you
what
i
have
done
then
if
thou
wilt
slay
me
for
it
i
shall
rejoice
in
that
i
shall
be
spared
the
further
guilt
of
taking
my
own
wretched
life
ben
obed
cried
anat
with
a
sudden
premonition
of
what
he
was
about
to
confess
yes
ben
obed
apostate
false
witness
false
friend
murderer
and
he
poured
out
in
rapid
disjointed
sentences
the
story
of
his
part
in
that
awful
day
s
work
there
was
silence
when
he
had
finished
and
the
wretched
man
turned
blindly
as
if
to
go
away
but
john
laid
a
detaining
hand
upon
his
arm
stay
he
said
and
there
was
the
boundless
love
and
forgiveness
of
jesus
in
his
voice
thou
hast
indeed
sinned
and
grievously
but
he
forgave
thee
at
the
last
even
as
did
christ
when
he
prayed
for
them
that
slew
him
and
thinkest
thou
not
that
he
would
bid
thee
live
live
to
carry
on
the
task
which
he
has
left
unfinished
i
am
unworthy
groaned
ben
obed
which
of
us
is
worthy
said
peter
behold
i
denied
the
lord
himself
with
curses
yet
he
bade
me
care
for
the
church
saying
unto
me
simon
simon
behold
satan
hath
desired
to
have
you
that
he
may
sift
you
as
wheat
but
i
have
prayed
for
thee
that
thy
faith
fail
not
and
when
thou
art
converted
strengthen
thy
i
wot
that
this
word
was
not
for
me
only
but
for
all
them
that
have
been
tempted
beyond
that
they
can
bear
and
when
ben
obed
heard
this
he
fell
on
his
knees
weeping
and
they
all
prayed
with
him
that
he
might
yet
be
restored
and
his
sins
forgiven
when
presently
he
rose
up
his
face
was
full
of
hope
behold
he
cried
the
lord
hath
forgiven
me
for
the
burden
hath
been
eased
from
off
my
soul
yet
must
i
go
away
from
this
place
whither
the
spirit
shall
lead
me
then
he
turned
to
anat
canst
thou
also
forgive
he
asked
and
his
voice
trembled
the
maiden
was
silent
but
only
for
a
moment
she
rose
in
her
place
and
stretched
out
her
hand
toward
the
young
man
i
forgive
thee
she
said
slowly
as
i
know
he
would
have
me
forgive
ben
obed
kissed
the
extended
hand
humbly
then
he
went
away
whither
the
spirit
led
him
and
no
one
of
them
saw
his
face
more
while
they
lived
but
in
after
years
john
heard
of
one
who
preached
christ
among
the
slaves
of
alexandria
suffering
many
things
for
christ
s
sake
and
at
the
last
dying
beneath
the
scourge
the
name
of
this
man
was
ben
obed
so
said
the
pilgrim
who
told
the
thing
chapter
xxx
a
flask
of
crystal
the
beasts
are
gone
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
but
i
care
not
thou
wouldst
have
told
a
different
tale
not
many
years
since
and
the
speaker
laughed
poof
i
am
cold
he
continued
stooping
to
stir
the
fire
we
might
as
well
have
gone
back
before
the
sun
set
there
is
no
fuel
here
the
other
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
and
spread
his
lean
fingers
over
the
scanty
fire
but
he
said
nothing
after
a
time
his
companion
spoke
again
in
a
slow
meditative
way
as
if
to
himself
my
lord
will
say
this
a
poorer
than
i
hath
need
of
the
beasts
therefore
he
hath
taken
them
would
that
he
had
asked
me
and
i
would
have
given
him
freely
nevertheless
if
he
hath
need
it
is
in
itself
sufficient
to
excuse
the
verily
broke
in
the
other
with
a
sneer
and
because
of
this
senile
madness
the
tribe
waxes
poorer
day
by
day
abu
ben
hesed
is
a
fool
i
ben
kish
say
so
what
inheritance
will
my
sons
have
that
is
worth
the
having
if
these
things
continue
senile
madness
dost
thou
call
it
and
what
says
ben
abu
who
succeeds
as
chief
when
the
old
man
shall
be
gathered
to
his
fathers
i
have
no
dealings
with
him
answered
ben
kish
sullenly
he
harps
continually
on
the
same
string
do
this
because
the
nazarene
commanded
it
forbear
the
other
because
the
nazarene
declared
that
it
was
what
do
i
care
for
this
dead
nazarene
or
his
sayings
moreover
i
do
not
believe
the
tales
that
they
tell
of
him
nor
do
any
believe
in
judæa
save
them
that
be
poor
and
have
nothing
to
lose
thereby
i
asked
concerning
the
thing
when
i
went
up
to
jerusalem
of
a
great
rabbi
whom
i
saw
in
the
temple
i
had
paid
my
vows
and
offered
my
sacrifice
according
to
the
law
and
i
heard
the
man
speaking
to
the
people
concerning
this
new
doctrine
of
the
nazarene
blasphemous
he
called
it
a
cunning
device
of
satan
to
entrap
the
foolish
of
heart
and
above
all
contrary
to
the
law
of
moreover
them
that
practise
these
unlawful
sayings
in
jerusalem
are
shortly
to
be
dealt
with
said
he
so
indeed
exclaimed
the
other
man
who
was
called
simeon
then
is
it
something
more
than
senile
madness
that
doth
ail
our
worshipful
lord
the
devil
himself
hath
a
hand
in
it
listen
said
ben
kish
leaning
toward
his
companion
i
am
minded
to
tell
thee
what
he
further
said
to
me
in
private
swear
to
me
that
thou
wilt
not
reveal
it
by
the
temple
cried
simeon
readily
ben
kish
looked
behind
him
and
on
either
side
as
if
he
feared
that
some
one
might
be
lurking
near
the
glimmering
wastes
of
desert
showed
vast
and
empty
stretching
away
beneath
the
keen
sparkle
of
countless
stars
the
night
wind
wandering
in
the
hollow
darkness
cried
aloud
for
loneliness
the
crouching
camels
stared
at
the
meagre
fire
and
chewed
their
cuds
in
drowsy
contentment
i
have
a
feeling
that
some
one
is
near
and
listening
he
said
shivering
a
little
and
throwing
a
fresh
handful
of
fuel
on
the
dying
fire
the
other
man
laughed
but
he
also
shivered
there
is
always
that
feeling
in
the
desert
at
night
he
said
it
must
be
the
stars
that
look
down
like
large
eyes
out
of
heaven
or
the
wind
that
hath
in
it
the
sound
of
a
woman
wailing
for
her
dead
but
what
hast
thou
to
say
to
me
thou
hast
sworn
i
have
sworn
and
by
the
temple
what
more
wouldst
thou
i
spoke
with
him
concerning
our
chief
said
ben
kish
of
how
he
came
up
to
jerusalem
and
fell
in
with
them
that
told
him
of
the
nazarene
and
how
that
since
that
time
he
doth
continually
exhort
and
preach
to
us
concerning
the
man
calling
him
the
messiah
the
holy
and
righteous
one
foretold
by
the
prophets
and
by
moses
alas
said
the
rabbi
he
hath
been
snared
by
evil
counsels
and
he
will
also
lead
away
after
him
all
that
he
hath
not
so
led
me
i
said
for
i
believe
not
on
a
man
who
commands
that
if
an
enemy
smite
thee
on
one
cheek
thou
immediately
turn
to
him
the
other
that
he
may
smite
again
and
if
a
thief
take
away
thy
camel
let
him
have
thy
horse
also
it
is
unjust
it
is
not
only
unjust
it
is
unlawful
said
this
wise
rabbi
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
is
the
law
a
good
law
and
yet
must
we
submit
to
the
chief
of
our
tribe
said
the
man
who
listened
that
is
also
the
law
nay
friend
cried
ben
kish
triumphantly
listen
still
further
i
said
something
of
the
like
to
the
wise
rabbi
and
he
made
me
answer
thus
the
unbeliever
and
the
blasphemer
shall
be
cast
forth
and
his
inheritance
shall
be
given
to
them
which
are
faithful
for
thus
is
it
written
in
the
law
if
therefore
there
be
them
amongst
you
which
are
able
rise
up
and
overcome
this
man
who
hath
spoken
thus
blasphemously
and
cast
him
forth
that
the
inheritance
be
thine
so
may
the
lord
ever
prevail
against
false
prophets
and
workers
of
holy
jerusalem
exclaimed
simeon
under
his
breath
smite
ben
hesed
cast
ben
hesed
forth
from
his
own
tribe
the
man
wot
not
of
whom
he
was
speaking
one
must
use
discretion
with
such
an
one
admitted
ben
kish
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
matter
with
the
father
of
my
wife
he
is
a
wise
man
as
thou
knowest
and
he
hath
moreover
a
bitterness
against
ben
hesed
because
that
he
spake
severely
to
him
of
his
dealings
with
the
two
egyptian
brats
whom
we
found
half
dead
in
the
desert
some
years
ago
the
man
was
ready
to
believe
the
word
of
strangers
rather
than
the
word
of
his
sister
s
son
which
was
unjust
pagiel
moreover
hath
not
forgotten
the
matter
nor
will
he
forget
if
ben
hesed
be
cast
forth
who
would
then
be
chief
said
simeon
drawing
his
beard
thoughtfully
through
his
hand
and
looking
intently
into
the
coals
ben
kish
studied
the
face
opposite
him
in
silence
for
a
moment
before
replying
who
else
should
it
be
but
pagiel
the
next
of
kin
he
said
at
length
and
after
him
after
him
the
husband
of
his
daughter
since
his
sons
are
both
dead
and
ben
kish
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
looked
about
him
as
if
he
were
already
chief
ah
hast
thou
aught
to
say
against
it
demanded
the
son
of
kish
sharply
half
involuntarily
laying
his
hand
upon
the
knife
in
his
girdle
dost
thou
then
prefer
a
chief
who
sends
for
his
enemy
when
he
hath
been
despoiled
of
him
and
reasons
with
him
forsooth
and
gives
him
a
present
and
soft
words
instead
of
rising
up
and
smiting
him
as
is
the
fashion
of
men
since
the
world
began
ay
and
will
be
despite
the
driveling
commands
of
any
number
of
false
prophets
betray
me
if
thou
wilt
go
to
ben
hesed
and
say
the
son
of
kish
hath
devised
evil
against
thee
in
his
heart
therefore
smite
would
he
smite
me
the
doting
greybeard
pah
i
spit
in
his
face
and
he
leaned
forward
and
spat
venomously
into
the
fire
the
other
man
laughed
silently
at
sight
of
his
rage
i
will
not
go
to
ben
hesed
with
this
tale
he
said
at
length
have
i
not
sworn
and
by
the
temple
say
on
friend
how
wilt
thou
bring
this
thing
to
pass
ben
kish
looked
at
him
suspiciously
i
will
say
no
more
he
said
sullenly
if
thou
wilt
side
with
the
follower
of
the
nazarene
who
is
become
a
fit
prey
for
the
vultures
because
of
his
blasphemous
folly
well
but
i
tell
thee
that
strange
things
will
come
to
pass
thou
wilt
see
it
i
have
not
said
that
i
believe
in
the
nazarene
said
his
companion
the
old
law
is
good
as
for
ben
hesed
i
he
stopped
short
and
stared
fixedly
at
a
certain
red
coal
which
winked
sleepily
at
him
from
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
from
which
he
seemed
presently
to
have
gotten
some
further
inward
light
for
he
went
on
more
briskly
i
also
have
an
account
to
square
with
ben
hesed
therefore
thou
mayest
speak
freely
with
me
i
promise
thee
that
i
will
help
on
the
lawful
issue
in
this
matter
and
that
right
diligently
dost
thou
swear
this
by
the
soul
of
my
father
by
the
god
of
the
covenant
and
by
the
stars
of
heaven
well
then
ben
hesed
will
set
forth
for
jerusalem
never
mind
how
i
know
thou
wilt
see
he
will
set
forth
he
and
certain
chosen
ones
of
his
who
also
believe
on
the
nazarene
and
we
will
remain
behind
in
charge
of
the
stuff
of
the
women
of
the
children
the
young
men
the
maidens
the
tents
and
the
furniture
thereof
the
herds
and
the
flocks
but
he
will
return
he
will
not
return
he
nor
any
that
go
forth
with
him
nor
shall
any
know
what
hath
befallen
him
and
how
canst
thou
accomplish
this
ben
kish
looked
about
him
once
more
the
stars
were
very
bright
now
and
the
lonely
wind
wailed
loudly
in
his
ear
it
swept
away
with
a
moan
into
the
empty
desert
the
loose
sand
leaping
up
beneath
the
trail
of
its
unseen
garments
there
be
many
things
under
the
sun
he
said
at
length
his
face
whitening
a
little
of
which
thou
hast
not
heard
and
of
which
i
have
heard
only
a
moon
since
this
is
one
of
them
and
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
tiny
flask
of
crystal
filled
with
a
colorless
liquid
i
have
but
to
drop
the
contents
of
this
flask
into
water
he
whispered
leaning
forward
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
companion
s
breast
and
they
that
drink
thereof
will
sleep
sleep
sound
and
long
what
meanest
thou
exclaimed
the
other
drawing
back
into
the
friendly
darkness
they
will
wake
no
more
who
drink
either
for
war
or
peace
the
desert
shall
work
its
will
upon
them
who
have
trodden
under
foot
the
law
chapter
xxxi
a
scarlet
thread
these
matters
whereof
thou
hast
spoken
to
us
are
good
my
lord
of
the
truth
of
them
am
i
well
convinced
because
of
thy
wisdom
in
showing
forth
the
prophecies
which
are
writ
by
the
hand
of
holy
and
righteous
men
in
the
scriptures
and
pagiel
bowed
himself
before
ben
hesed
with
a
solemn
countenance
ben
hesed
laid
aside
the
parchment
roll
from
which
he
had
been
reading
and
a
smile
of
exceeding
sweetness
dawned
in
his
keen
eyes
my
heart
is
rejoiced
son
of
my
sister
he
said
gently
because
thou
hast
believed
these
wondrous
tidings
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
both
in
this
present
world
and
in
the
world
to
come
even
as
our
glorified
lord
hath
declared
blessed
is
he
that
hath
not
seen
and
yet
hath
would
that
every
one
in
this
company
of
ours
could
also
find
the
light
in
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
shall
every
word
be
established
as
is
it
written
my
lord
if
now
of
those
holy
men
who
consorted
with
the
nazarene
in
his
one
could
come
into
the
desert
and
preach
to
us
of
him
that
was
crucified
there
would
remain
not
one
of
us
all
who
should
not
believe
i
have
thought
of
that
many
times
said
ben
hesed
drawing
his
heavy
brows
together
surely
i
ought
to
do
this
thing
that
all
they
that
dwell
in
this
land
may
hear
the
good
tidings
of
this
exceeding
great
joy
to
my
enemy
also
could
be
preached
the
words
of
love
and
good
will
then
would
peace
reign
in
the
desert
his
will
should
be
done
on
earth
even
as
in
heaven
no
more
shedding
of
blood
no
more
strife
no
more
hatred
and
why
indeed
should
not
these
things
be
and
the
speaker
s
face
glowed
it
is
most
simple
most
easy
we
have
but
to
obey
obey
exactly
the
words
of
the
holy
jesus
most
easy
most
simple
murmured
pagiel
rolling
up
his
eyes
sanctimoniously
it
will
doubtless
soon
come
to
pass
then
will
the
lion
lie
down
with
the
lamb
even
as
it
is
written
i
will
do
it
cried
ben
hesed
and
i
will
set
forth
without
delay
some
one
of
them
can
surely
be
spared
if
not
of
the
apostles
the
young
man
stephen
a
most
learned
most
holy
one
i
will
also
fetch
the
two
egyptians
who
will
by
this
time
have
grown
wise
in
the
faith
thou
wilt
love
them
now
my
pagiel
because
of
the
love
of
christ
in
thy
heart
love
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
assuredly
cried
the
other
with
a
venomous
gleam
in
his
eye
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
very
good
very
true
we
must
all
think
of
the
law
we
need
think
of
but
two
laws
now
god
be
praised
said
ben
hesed
even
as
it
was
declared
by
the
crucified
one
thou
shalt
love
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
and
with
all
thy
mind
this
is
the
first
and
great
commandment
and
the
second
is
like
unto
it
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
on
these
two
commandments
hang
all
the
law
and
the
wilt
thou
that
i
command
the
beasts
to
be
made
ready
for
the
start
suggested
pagiel
with
an
impatient
glance
at
ben
hesed
s
abstracted
face
on
such
an
errand
there
can
scarce
be
too
great
speed
thou
art
right
make
ready
and
at
once
i
will
take
thee
with
me
also
my
sons
and
ten
men
which
are
skilled
with
the
bow
since
it
may
be
that
we
fall
in
with
evil
company
by
the
way
resist
not
evil
as
saith
the
nazarene
quoth
pagiel
piously
will
it
not
be
better
my
lord
to
leave
me
in
charge
of
the
women
and
little
ones
since
i
am
next
of
kin
to
my
lord
ben
hesed
looked
sharply
into
the
meek
face
of
pagiel
i
will
leave
thee
in
charge
he
said
but
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
man
more
than
once
within
the
hour
as
for
pagiel
he
was
glad
because
that
the
eye
of
man
is
not
able
to
read
the
heart
he
laughed
within
himself
as
with
the
help
of
ben
kish
he
made
ready
the
beasts
of
burden
and
the
provisions
for
he
thought
that
his
day
was
come
and
he
laughed
yet
again
aloud
when
ben
hesed
set
forth
on
his
journey
taking
with
him
his
two
sons
together
with
ten
men
who
were
skillful
with
the
bow
his
wife
heard
him
laugh
as
he
stood
in
the
door
of
the
tent
and
she
asked
him
what
is
it
that
hath
pleased
the
heart
of
my
lord
to
every
man
cometh
a
time
to
rejoice
he
made
answer
and
long
enough
have
i
eaten
out
my
heart
in
bitterness
make
ready
now
a
supper
for
we
will
feast
this
night
then
he
turned
to
his
where
is
simeon
nay
i
know
not
answered
ben
kish
he
is
perhaps
with
the
herds
go
and
fetch
him
commanded
pagiel
ben
kish
made
search
for
the
man
simeon
but
he
found
him
not
neither
with
the
herds
nor
anywhere
about
the
encampment
the
man
is
gathering
fuel
he
said
scowling
or
he
hath
gone
perchance
after
some
wild
beast
to
slay
it
but
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
simeon
had
not
returned
nor
did
he
come
that
night
i
hope
said
ben
kish
that
a
wild
beast
hath
slain
him
all
that
day
ben
hesed
with
his
two
sons
and
the
ten
men
who
were
skilful
with
the
bow
made
haste
on
their
journey
and
stayed
not
for
said
ben
hesed
i
should
have
done
this
thing
many
moons
since
i
alone
am
not
sufficient
for
the
work
at
evening
an
encampment
was
made
so
that
they
might
rest
and
be
refreshed
as
the
servants
were
gathering
fuel
for
the
fires
one
of
them
saw
a
man
running
toward
the
place
where
they
were
and
he
went
and
told
ben
hesed
saying
behold
we
have
seen
an
appearance
as
of
a
man
running
how
can
this
be
seeing
that
we
are
already
a
day
s
journey
in
the
wilderness
but
even
as
he
told
the
thing
the
runner
approached
the
encampment
and
he
fell
on
his
face
before
ben
hesed
it
is
simeon
said
ben
hesed
raise
him
up
and
give
him
water
that
he
may
speak
he
hath
perchance
evil
tidings
so
they
raised
him
up
and
offered
him
water
but
he
would
not
drink
until
he
had
seen
the
skin
from
which
the
water
was
taken
then
he
drank
deep
and
long
what
doth
this
mean
said
ben
hesed
art
thou
then
smitten
with
madness
or
hast
thou
tidings
of
evil
tidings
of
evil
alas
my
lord
said
simeon
bowing
himself
before
his
chief
and
he
told
ben
hesed
all
that
the
son
of
kish
had
said
also
how
that
he
had
showed
him
the
crystal
flask
in
the
desert
by
night
the
wherein
the
potion
was
mingled
is
marked
he
said
i
went
away
by
stealth
into
the
desert
that
i
might
meet
thee
as
thou
camest
out
but
it
chanced
that
thou
camest
out
by
another
way
and
i
was
not
able
to
overtake
thee
till
now
he
showed
them
moreover
the
bound
with
a
scarlet
thread
about
its
nozzle
ben
hesed
rose
up
after
that
simeon
had
told
him
all
and
he
went
away
into
the
desert
alone
for
the
space
of
three
hours
that
he
might
take
counsel
with
the
almighty
concerning
the
thing
when
he
returned
he
called
four
of
the
strong
men
unto
him
and
he
said
to
them
the
moon
is
full
therefore
get
ye
up
and
make
haste
to
return
to
the
encampment
and
when
thou
art
returned
seek
out
pagiel
and
the
son
of
kish
and
say
to
them
my
lord
hath
commanded
the
presence
of
you
both
that
he
may
speak
unto
you
concerning
a
matter
of
say
no
more
than
this
to
the
men
and
if
they
come
with
you
willingly
well
but
if
they
will
not
come
then
fetch
them
straightway
we
will
remain
in
this
place
until
thou
shalt
return
so
the
four
men
made
haste
all
that
night
to
return
and
in
the
morning
they
stood
before
the
tent
of
pagiel
and
called
for
him
to
come
out
for
he
slept
late
because
of
the
feasting
pagiel
came
forth
after
a
space
and
heard
what
the
men
had
to
say
and
he
bowed
his
head
before
the
messengers
of
ben
hesed
i
will
arouse
my
son
he
said
that
we
may
obey
the
commands
of
my
lord
he
would
doubtless
give
to
us
some
further
directions
concerning
the
herds
awake
he
cried
in
the
ear
of
ben
kish
awake
to
see
an
evil
day
for
my
heart
mistrusts
me
concerning
the
man
simeon
thou
shouldst
not
have
told
him
i
told
him
at
thy
bidding
cried
ben
kish
and
thinkest
thou
that
we
could
carry
out
this
thing
without
adherents
if
thou
fearest
ben
hesed
why
not
refuse
to
go
tell
the
men
that
thy
wife
is
ailing
and
that
i
am
with
the
herds
when
they
shall
search
for
me
i
will
flee
in
the
opposite
direction
pagiel
shook
his
head
gloomily
thy
counsel
is
evil
son
of
a
herdsman
he
replied
my
wife
is
already
at
the
fountain
and
for
thee
would
they
make
instant
search
we
had
best
go
peaceably
for
if
we
refuse
they
will
suspect
evil
of
us
it
may
be
after
all
that
he
hath
heard
nothing
and
at
the
worst
ben
hesed
is
a
merciful
man
so
the
two
came
forth
with
great
show
of
willingness
and
they
went
with
the
messengers
of
ben
hesed
into
the
wilderness
a
day
s
journey
at
evening
they
stood
in
the
presence
of
ben
hesed
and
he
spoke
to
them
of
the
crystal
flask
straightway
thus
wouldst
thou
have
slain
more
than
a
of
souls
of
thine
own
kindred
he
said
his
eyes
burning
with
a
fire
that
was
terrible
to
see
and
that
without
warning
and
without
mercy
what
hast
thou
to
say
in
thy
defense
the
face
of
pagiel
became
the
color
of
death
when
he
heard
these
words
and
he
would
have
fallen
had
not
ben
kish
held
him
up
thou
art
unjust
cried
the
son
of
the
herdsman
boldly
prate
not
of
mercy
to
righteous
men
an
enemy
hath
told
thee
this
lie
concerning
us
twice
hast
thou
believed
the
word
of
a
stranger
before
the
word
of
thy
near
kinsman
thou
art
unjust
is
the
thing
not
true
then
said
ben
hesed
mildly
though
his
eye
yet
burned
with
that
still
and
terrible
light
it
is
not
true
cried
ben
kish
i
swear
it
by
hold
said
ben
hesed
sternly
then
he
turned
to
pagiel
is
this
tale
of
the
poisoned
water
true
or
is
it
a
lie
it
is
a
lie
a
foul
lie
a
blasphemous
lie
cried
pagiel
stoutly
the
color
stealing
back
to
his
livid
face
would
i
thinkest
thou
lift
up
my
hand
against
my
next
of
kin
an
enemy
hath
dealt
deceitfully
with
thee
may
god
requite
him
god
will
requite
him
said
ben
hesed
solemnly
and
he
will
also
requite
thee
hear
now
what
i
shall
say
we
are
by
swift
dromedaries
a
day
s
march
from
the
encampment
this
distance
ye
can
accomplish
on
foot
without
undue
fatigue
to
yourselves
within
the
space
of
three
days
return
therefore
in
peace
and
we
will
proceed
on
our
journey
pagiel
bowed
himself
before
his
lord
thou
art
a
just
man
he
cried
but
in
his
heart
he
called
ben
hesed
a
fool
wilt
thou
give
us
provisions
that
we
faint
not
by
the
way
asked
the
son
of
kish
looking
suspiciously
into
the
calm
face
of
his
chief
assuredly
answered
ben
hesed
both
of
food
and
of
water
and
he
arose
and
gave
command
to
his
servants
that
provision
should
be
made
for
the
sustenance
of
the
two
men
during
a
three
day
s
journey
of
the
best
of
the
corn
of
the
dates
and
of
the
cheeses
of
goat
s
milk
which
they
had
provided
a
skin
of
water
also
commanded
he
to
give
them
and
so
they
presently
set
forth
ben
hesed
and
his
company
upon
their
swift
dromedaries
their
faces
turned
toward
judæa
pagiel
and
the
son
of
kish
walking
slowly
in
the
opposite
direction
bearing
upon
their
backs
the
provision
which
ben
hesed
had
given
them
no
sooner
was
the
caravan
out
of
sight
and
hearing
than
pagiel
threw
down
his
burden
and
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
and
he
kissed
ben
kish
on
both
his
cheeks
verily
he
cried
thou
art
a
son
worth
the
having
for
this
day
thou
didst
save
me
from
the
incredible
folly
of
confessing
to
yonder
hoary
knave
all
that
was
in
my
heart
the
words
were
even
upon
my
lips
ha
ha
the
wisdom
of
ben
hesed
is
very
foolishness
compared
with
the
wisdom
of
the
son
of
kish
give
me
to
drink
son
for
i
thirst
already
because
of
my
laughter
ben
kish
let
down
the
from
his
shoulder
then
he
stared
at
it
his
eyes
bulging
from
his
head
in
terror
about
the
nozzle
was
bound
a
scarlet
thread
chapter
xxxii
ben
hesed
in
jerusalem
on
the
fifth
day
of
his
journey
ben
hesed
reached
jerusalem
and
he
encamped
without
the
city
saying
to
his
servants
bide
ye
here
while
i
offer
a
sacrifice
in
the
temple
afterward
i
will
seek
out
the
men
with
whom
i
have
business
so
he
went
his
way
into
the
city
he
and
his
two
sons
leaving
the
men
in
the
encampment
and
he
went
straightway
into
the
temple
and
offered
a
burnt
offering
for
his
tribe
by
the
hand
of
the
priest
casting
also
a
goodly
sum
into
the
treasury
for
a
as
he
came
out
because
that
he
had
completed
his
journey
in
safety
we
will
go
now
to
the
house
of
john
the
apostle
he
said
to
his
sons
his
face
shining
with
peace
but
as
the
three
of
them
went
their
way
through
the
streets
they
came
suddenly
upon
a
great
concourse
of
people
gathered
about
the
doors
of
a
synagogue
they
could
see
that
the
synagogue
also
was
crowded
the
doors
standing
open
because
of
the
pressure
of
the
multitude
ben
hesed
paused
for
a
moment
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
heavy
blows
and
of
groaning
from
within
the
multitude
also
heard
and
they
cried
aloud
and
gnashed
their
teeth
at
the
sound
fetch
the
blasphemers
forth
cried
one
stone
them
howled
another
what
is
this
that
is
taking
place
within
the
synagogue
asked
ben
hesed
of
one
who
stood
next
him
in
the
crowd
the
man
glanced
carelessly
at
his
questioner
they
are
scourging
two
of
the
nazarenes
he
replied
there
is
no
use
to
try
to
get
in
friend
he
added
one
must
come
early
to
secure
a
good
place
for
seeing
the
sport
fetch
the
blasphemers
forth
and
stone
them
he
yelled
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
ha
they
will
fetch
them
forth
we
shall
see
them
after
all
and
he
struggled
through
the
crowd
toward
the
steps
of
the
synagogue
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
tumult
said
ben
hesed
again
and
this
time
he
put
his
question
to
a
man
in
the
garb
of
a
carpenter
who
stood
eying
the
scene
with
an
inscrutable
expression
upon
his
face
the
man
turned
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
looked
at
him
suspiciously
whence
dost
thou
come
that
thou
shouldst
ask
he
said
coldly
then
with
another
searching
glance
he
added
they
are
merely
torturing
some
of
the
followers
of
the
nazarene
under
the
scourge
it
is
lawful
lawful
cried
ben
hesed
who
is
it
that
dares
call
such
an
outrage
lawful
room
here
that
i
may
look
further
into
this
matter
but
the
carpenter
laid
a
warning
hand
upon
his
arm
hist
man
he
whispered
if
thou
art
indeed
a
friend
of
the
nazarenes
hold
thy
peace
else
wilt
thou
shortly
find
thyself
where
thou
canst
advantage
neither
thyself
nor
them
that
believe
his
last
words
were
drowned
in
the
savage
yell
with
which
the
multitude
greeted
the
appearance
of
a
detachment
of
temple
police
armed
with
drawn
swords
these
marched
rapidly
down
the
steps
of
the
synagogue
the
crowd
opening
to
let
them
pass
half
dragging
half
carrying
the
limp
figures
of
two
men
whose
garments
and
drawn
ghastly
faces
betrayed
what
they
had
suffered
within
after
them
poured
out
the
congregation
gesticulating
and
talking
excitedly
stubborn
fools
ben
hesed
heard
one
man
say
they
have
but
to
confess
the
crucified
nazarene
accursed
to
escape
all
if
they
will
not
do
that
let
them
die
where
are
they
taking
these
men
said
ben
hesed
to
the
carpenter
who
still
stood
at
his
elbow
to
the
prison
to
recover
from
this
scourging
when
they
will
receive
another
or
worse
if
they
repent
not
of
their
blasphemous
folly
answered
the
man
in
a
hard
voice
let
us
get
out
of
this
crowd
for
god
s
sake
he
whispered
in
the
next
breath
or
we
shall
both
be
seized
the
upper
end
of
the
street
was
comparatively
clear
of
people
and
here
they
presently
found
themselves
thou
art
then
a
stranger
in
jerusalem
queried
the
carpenter
wiping
the
great
drops
from
his
forehead
and
a
follower
of
the
man
jesus
ay
i
thought
so
verily
thou
must
needs
know
that
it
were
best
to
get
thee
back
into
thine
own
country
and
as
speedily
as
possible
jerusalem
is
no
place
for
them
that
believe
i
myself
am
going
this
very
day
with
my
wife
and
little
ones
only
this
morning
i
saw
the
spies
of
saul
in
our
street
thou
blowest
both
hot
and
cold
friend
said
ben
hesed
severely
but
a
moment
since
yes
yes
i
know
what
thou
wouldst
say
i
spoke
of
their
blasphemous
folly
but
and
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
looked
anxiously
about
one
of
the
temple
police
stood
at
my
elbow
i
have
a
family
to
feed
therefore
i
must
needs
be
cautious
trust
in
the
lord
and
do
good
so
shalt
thou
dwell
in
the
land
and
verily
thou
shalt
be
why
didst
thou
not
hold
thy
peace
altogether
rather
than
speak
deceitfully
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
no
mind
to
be
either
scourged
or
stoned
for
the
faith
he
said
i
saw
the
stoning
of
stephen
and
what
is
it
that
thou
art
saying
cried
ben
hesed
aghast
the
stoning
of
stephen
hast
thou
not
heard
of
it
the
very
day
after
his
death
this
persecution
broke
out
saul
of
tarsus
and
the
sanhedrim
where
is
john
interrupted
ben
hesed
and
the
other
apostles
what
of
the
women
some
of
the
apostles
are
in
prison
answered
the
man
others
are
in
hiding
many
of
the
disciples
are
fled
from
the
city
some
are
in
their
graves
they
alone
are
safe
and
the
speaker
shivered
with
apprehension
and
again
looked
furtively
about
him
verily
they
build
up
zion
with
blood
and
jerusalem
with
iniquity
said
ben
hesed
solemnly
therefore
shall
zion
for
your
sakes
be
plowed
as
a
field
and
jerusalem
shall
become
as
heaps
and
the
mountain
of
the
house
as
the
high
places
of
the
i
can
not
tarry
longer
said
the
carpenter
impatiently
if
thou
art
a
discreet
man
thou
wilt
leave
jerusalem
before
nightfall
for
my
part
i
would
that
i
had
never
heard
of
the
nazarene
farewell
ben
hesed
looked
after
his
retreating
figure
thoughtfully
what
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things
o
lord
he
murmured
behold
many
shall
be
purified
and
made
white
and
tried
but
the
wicked
shall
do
wickedly
and
shall
not
understand
the
wise
shall
understand
wilt
thou
that
we
return
unto
the
encampment
said
his
younger
son
we
shall
not
be
able
to
find
them
that
we
would
and
we
are
not
sufficient
in
number
to
succor
the
distressed
the
eyes
of
ben
hesed
flashed
return
if
thou
wilt
son
and
hide
beneath
the
robe
of
thy
mother
but
as
for
me
the
lord
hath
brought
me
up
to
jerusalem
at
this
time
that
i
might
smite
the
destroyer
i
am
no
coward
and
that
thou
knowest
right
well
my
father
answered
the
young
man
haughtily
but
remember
i
pray
thee
that
we
have
left
the
tribe
with
no
leader
now
that
pagiel
hath
been
proven
false
if
we
should
all
three
fall
what
of
our
wives
our
little
ones
our
flocks
and
our
herds
verily
they
would
come
upon
evil
days
and
shall
not
a
man
set
them
of
his
own
household
before
them
which
are
strangers
return
thou
my
father
we
will
remain
thou
hast
spoken
not
unwisely
son
admitted
ben
hesed
we
must
even
go
cautiously
about
this
matter
and
if
presently
it
appear
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
bloodshed
thou
ben
abu
shalt
return
with
two
of
the
strong
men
as
for
me
i
am
already
old
if
i
fall
it
matters
not
come
let
us
be
going
so
they
went
their
way
towards
the
house
of
john
past
the
where
excited
groups
were
discussing
the
reign
of
blood
which
had
begun
in
jerusalem
past
the
synagogues
crowded
with
people
for
the
scourging
of
the
nazarenes
was
going
forward
briskly
in
many
places
at
once
through
dark
alleys
and
beneath
covered
archways
where
men
garbed
as
temple
police
lurked
to
entrap
the
unwary
till
at
length
they
had
come
to
the
street
which
they
sought
it
was
choked
with
people
from
end
to
end
but
a
singular
and
almost
breathless
silence
prevailed
what
hath
befallen
here
asked
ben
hesed
of
a
woman
who
stood
holding
a
baby
in
her
arms
the
woman
turned
upon
him
a
white
frightened
face
alas
she
cried
they
refused
to
fly
when
they
were
warned
declaring
that
god
would
take
care
of
them
and
now
it
hath
come
to
pass
that
saul
himself
hath
entered
into
their
dwelling
god
help
them
dost
thou
speak
of
the
household
of
john
asked
ben
hesed
yes
my
god
he
has
seized
them
and
the
woman
burst
into
a
hysterical
shriek
as
a
deep
low
murmur
arose
from
the
multitude
shame
shame
cried
several
voices
at
once
leave
the
women
in
peace
room
there
silence
cried
a
harsh
voice
use
your
swords
men
to
clear
the
way
there
was
an
instant
scattering
amongst
the
crowd
mostly
composed
of
women
and
children
two
or
three
of
the
more
timid
ones
bursting
into
loud
screams
at
sight
of
the
glittering
weapons
forward
commanded
the
leader
a
swarthy
undersized
man
from
whose
scowling
face
and
fiery
eyes
the
frightened
children
hid
their
faces
so
this
was
the
dreaded
saul
of
tarsus
ben
hesed
looked
at
him
with
undisguised
contempt
murderous
coward
he
muttered
beneath
his
breath
but
now
the
prisoners
bound
with
heavy
chains
were
filing
past
three
women
their
faces
wrapped
in
their
mantles
in
whom
he
nevertheless
recognized
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
anna
the
wife
of
caiaphas
and
anat
the
egyptian
girl
behind
these
walked
a
young
man
also
bound
whose
bleeding
face
and
torn
garments
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
had
not
failed
to
defend
those
committed
to
his
charge
if
we
had
but
come
an
hour
earlier
we
might
have
held
the
place
exclaimed
ben
hesed
clenching
his
fists
let
us
follow
and
see
whither
they
will
take
them
it
is
useless
to
attempt
a
rescue
now
to
the
temple
came
the
second
command
close
up
there
and
march
more
rapidly
save
thy
tears
woman
thou
wilt
have
further
need
for
them
coward
cried
ben
hesed
again
and
this
time
it
was
evident
that
the
quick
ear
of
saul
had
caught
the
sound
for
he
turned
and
fixed
a
murderous
look
upon
the
speaker
dog
of
an
apostate
he
hissed
thy
day
is
coming
callest
thou
me
dog
cried
ben
hesed
in
a
fury
and
would
have
closed
with
the
pharisee
on
the
spot
had
not
his
two
sons
held
him
let
be
whispered
the
younger
of
the
twain
or
we
shall
not
be
able
to
save
them
ben
hesed
drew
back
muttering
fiercely
i
will
slay
him
for
that
word
he
said
let
us
follow
them
in
but
this
it
presently
appeared
was
impossible
for
the
prisoners
being
now
arrived
at
the
temple
were
conducted
by
way
of
the
court
of
the
women
into
the
lesser
chamber
of
judgment
and
immediately
the
doors
were
shut
chapter
xxxiii
the
mercy
of
israel
the
light
which
streamed
in
from
the
single
window
high
up
in
the
massive
wall
revealed
a
square
room
ceiled
and
paved
with
stone
it
was
empty
save
for
an
oaken
table
behind
which
in
a
chair
sat
an
old
man
of
severe
and
reverend
aspect
on
either
side
of
him
stood
two
officers
of
the
temple
police
motionless
as
statues
and
armed
with
long
staves
all
this
anat
who
was
the
first
of
the
women
to
pass
into
the
chamber
saw
with
a
single
timid
glance
she
shrank
back
before
the
stern
eyes
of
the
man
in
the
chair
and
reaching
out
one
manacled
hand
touched
the
robe
of
mary
who
was
just
behind
her
the
mother
of
jesus
took
the
little
trembling
hand
and
held
it
firmly
saul
advanced
to
the
table
and
laid
upon
it
a
slip
of
parchment
at
the
same
time
whispering
a
few
words
into
the
ear
of
the
old
man
who
frowned
slightly
and
nodded
once
or
twice
as
his
eye
passed
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
four
prisoners
where
is
the
man
john
he
demanded
suddenly
no
one
answered
can
ye
not
speak
he
cried
striking
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
or
hath
it
come
to
pass
that
your
scurrilous
tongues
are
already
withered
in
your
mouths
if
thou
art
questioning
me
said
seth
calmly
i
wot
not
where
the
apostle
is
he
went
forth
on
some
errand
of
mercy
early
this
morning
leaving
me
in
charge
of
the
house
we
be
citizens
dwelling
in
a
city
wherefore
hath
it
come
to
pass
that
we
are
thus
dragged
through
the
streets
in
chains
that
shalt
thou
shortly
hear
replied
annas
grimly
hast
thou
examined
these
prisoners
he
asked
turning
to
saul
i
examined
them
briefly
before
making
the
arrests
according
to
my
custom
answered
saul
for
i
would
not
that
i
transgress
the
law
in
this
work
of
purging
the
holy
city
of
them
that
blaspheme
i
found
all
of
these
prisoners
obstinate
and
unwilling
to
renounce
their
sins
and
to
make
confession
of
their
unrighteousness
therefore
i
have
brought
them
before
thee
for
further
examination
and
sentence
this
being
so
the
law
must
take
its
course
with
them
said
annas
sternly
do
thou
mary
of
nazareth
stand
forth
remove
the
veil
from
off
thy
face
with
a
firm
step
the
mother
of
jesus
advanced
and
stood
before
the
table
she
threw
back
the
shrouding
mantle
her
beautiful
pallid
face
shining
forth
as
if
illumined
with
a
strange
inward
radiance
annas
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
then
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
fell
to
turning
over
the
parchments
which
lay
before
him
art
thou
the
mother
of
the
man
of
nazareth
i
am
thou
didst
teach
him
to
believe
unholy
and
blasphemous
things
regarding
himself
when
he
was
a
child
said
annas
still
looking
down
at
the
table
therefore
did
he
continue
to
delude
himself
and
others
when
he
was
grown
and
at
the
last
perished
miserably
on
the
accursed
tree
hath
not
god
punished
thee
sufficiently
for
thy
presumptuous
sin
that
thou
dost
still
persist
in
pretending
that
thy
son
is
the
messiah
of
israel
he
is
the
messiah
of
israel
said
mary
her
deep
eyes
shining
wherefore
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
for
he
hath
regarded
the
low
estate
of
his
behold
from
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
blessed
he
is
the
messiah
of
israel
but
he
is
also
much
more
he
is
the
prince
of
peace
the
saviour
of
the
world
for
the
lord
hath
shewed
strength
with
his
arm
he
hath
scattered
the
proud
in
the
imaginations
of
their
hearts
he
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seat
and
exalted
them
of
low
degree
and
god
hath
delivered
his
holy
child
jesus
from
death
and
from
the
power
of
the
grave
and
hath
set
him
down
at
the
right
hand
of
power
for
ever
more
daughter
of
abraham
said
annas
lifting
his
shaking
hand
thou
hast
blasphemed
thou
knowest
the
penalty
father
cried
an
agonized
voice
forbear
this
last
awful
sin
lest
god
smite
thee
in
his
wrath
and
consume
thee
to
ashes
at
the
sound
of
this
voice
the
face
of
annas
changed
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
shrouded
figure
which
knelt
before
him
who
who
is
it
that
speaks
to
me
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
it
is
i
thine
own
daughter
anna
dost
thou
not
know
me
i
beseech
thee
by
the
mercies
of
jehovah
that
thou
raise
not
thy
hand
against
the
mother
of
the
christ
woman
i
know
thee
not
get
thee
up
and
stand
back
out
of
thine
own
mouth
art
thou
already
condemned
i
care
not
for
myself
death
were
welcome
but
take
heed
to
thyself
i
beseech
thee
before
thou
layest
violent
hands
upon
this
holy
woman
annas
laughed
contemptuously
have
we
not
crucified
the
carpenter
he
said
and
are
unscathed
is
the
mother
of
the
carpenter
more
exalted
nay
we
shall
deal
with
her
after
the
law
the
law
is
just
at
this
seth
started
forward
prate
not
of
the
law
who
art
a
murderer
he
said
in
a
choked
voice
the
man
jesus
was
guiltless
and
ye
did
condemn
him
guiltless
also
are
these
women
release
them
but
do
with
me
as
thou
wilt
the
servant
is
not
greater
than
his
lord
annas
trembled
with
rage
he
essayed
to
speak
but
the
words
died
on
his
lips
now
seest
thou
what
manner
of
perverse
and
pestilent
apostates
these
are
said
saul
furthermore
the
man
is
an
alien
there
is
no
need
that
we
continue
to
argue
this
matter
with
them
israel
is
ever
merciful
and
just
according
to
the
commands
of
jehovah
therefore
let
them
be
publicly
scourged
without
the
gates
if
the
stripes
be
wholesome
to
bring
them
back
to
their
right
minds
and
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
well
they
will
then
confess
right
gladly
that
the
man
of
nazareth
and
all
his
works
are
of
the
devil
after
this
shall
a
blood
offering
be
made
for
them
so
shall
they
be
cleansed
from
their
iniquities
but
and
if
they
will
not
so
confess
let
their
sin
abide
upon
them
let
them
die
the
death
appointed
in
the
law
of
moses
for
such
as
are
blasphemers
justice
and
mercy
are
in
the
words
of
thy
mouth
said
annas
slowly
then
he
turned
to
the
prisoners
forty
stripes
save
one
shall
be
laid
upon
each
and
every
one
of
you
at
about
this
hour
according
to
the
magnitude
of
your
offences
and
the
law
of
moses
who
thus
appointed
it
for
the
peace
of
israel
afterward
if
ye
will
not
confess
ye
shall
die
the
appointed
death
mercy
have
mercy
cried
anna
laying
hold
of
his
robe
we
can
not
but
believe
the
things
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
nay
thou
wouldst
thyself
believe
if
the
lord
should
reveal
himself
to
thee
annas
drew
away
with
a
gesture
of
abhorrence
unhand
me
woman
he
said
sternly
satan
hath
blinded
thee
to
the
truth
i
will
pray
for
thee
that
thou
be
undeceived
at
the
last
take
them
away
thrust
these
blasphemers
into
the
inner
prison
commanded
saul
a
later
and
remember
that
thou
answerest
for
them
with
thine
own
life
come
not
to
me
on
the
morrow
with
any
whining
tale
of
angel
or
devil
and
think
thus
to
excuse
thyself
for
their
escape
let
them
be
missing
at
the
third
hour
and
thou
thyself
shalt
suffer
in
thine
own
body
the
penalty
to
which
these
are
condemned
thou
hast
heard
the
chief
jailer
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
heard
my
lord
this
night
at
every
watch
will
i
inspect
the
prisoners
but
i
pray
thee
send
also
additional
guards
for
life
is
precious
to
me
and
i
have
not
forgotten
what
hath
happened
more
than
once
when
these
nazarenes
have
been
imprisoned
peradventure
the
man
himself
might
appear
coward
growled
saul
the
man
hath
perished
off
the
face
of
the
earth
so
likewise
shall
perish
all
who
believe
on
him
if
thou
art
one
of
these
room
shall
be
made
for
thee
within
nay
my
lord
nay
cried
the
jailer
trembling
i
do
not
believe
i
swear
it
but
there
have
been
strange
things
of
late
and
the
devil
himself
hath
powers
i
will
send
a
guard
interrupted
saul
shortly
hold
thy
peace
and
do
thy
duty
and
all
shall
be
well
with
thee
admit
no
one
the
chief
jailer
bowed
himself
almost
to
the
ground
before
the
pharisee
whose
renown
had
by
this
time
spread
throughout
jerusalem
and
in
whose
presence
the
temple
officials
from
the
highest
unto
the
lowest
trembled
i
will
admit
no
one
he
said
and
he
again
made
obeisance
as
saul
strode
through
the
prison
gate
lock
the
gate
and
double
bar
it
he
cried
irritably
to
the
guard
then
stand
there
for
your
lives
if
these
prisoners
get
away
and
i
have
to
die
for
it
be
sure
that
not
one
of
you
shall
escape
thrust
the
man
into
the
stocks
he
added
to
the
turnkey
who
stood
at
his
elbow
as
for
the
women
chain
them
to
the
floor
i
will
come
after
a
little
and
look
to
them
food
no
let
them
fast
give
them
water
in
the
inner
prison
where
the
darkness
seemed
only
the
more
intense
because
of
the
feeble
rays
of
daylight
which
struggled
through
the
little
square
of
grating
above
the
door
were
the
four
who
were
condemned
to
death
the
young
man
seth
made
fast
in
the
stocks
the
three
women
chained
to
heavy
rings
which
were
riveted
into
the
stone
floor
dost
think
that
he
will
deliver
us
whispered
anat
laying
hold
of
the
robe
of
mary
and
pressing
it
to
her
lips
he
will
deliver
us
beloved
in
his
own
best
way
answered
mary
tenderly
if
the
way
lie
through
the
dark
valley
then
will
the
end
thereof
be
only
the
more
glorious
but
the
scourging
the
shame
how
how
shall
we
endure
it
wailed
anat
piteously
he
also
endured
being
divine
said
mary
her
voice
trembling
and
shall
we
who
are
but
mortal
shrink
back
think
not
of
the
morrow
save
as
thou
dost
think
that
we
shall
stand
before
him
in
clothing
of
immortality
but
if
we
fail
deny
him
faltered
anat
i
know
not
my
own
heart
whether
i
can
endure
unto
the
end
he
will
give
thee
grace
when
the
need
comes
wouldst
thou
at
this
moment
deny
him
no
ah
no
neither
wilt
thou
deny
him
on
the
morrow
he
giveth
his
strength
in
due
season
and
is
in
his
hand
as
for
anna
the
wife
of
caiaphas
she
sat
silent
her
head
bowed
upon
her
knees
mary
thought
that
perhaps
she
slept
and
in
her
tender
heart
she
hoped
that
this
was
so
every
hour
the
chief
jailer
flashed
the
light
of
his
torch
into
their
prison
where
now
is
he
that
delivereth
he
cried
tauntingly
and
again
if
angels
visit
thee
during
the
night
watches
cry
aloud
for
i
have
sworn
by
my
life
to
deliver
thy
bodies
to
judgment
on
the
morrow
being
insensible
as
indeed
are
most
mortals
to
celestial
sights
and
sounds
he
did
not
perceive
that
the
whole
place
was
filled
with
the
airs
of
heaven
and
with
the
rustling
of
angelic
pinions
at
midnight
the
drowsy
guards
were
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
upon
the
outer
gate
of
the
prison
open
cried
a
voice
open
at
once
in
the
name
of
the
sanhedrim
the
governor
of
the
prison
looked
out
and
beholding
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
that
it
was
caleb
himself
who
knocked
he
opened
cautiously
and
admitted
him
i
have
orders
said
caleb
to
speak
a
word
in
private
with
one
of
the
women
who
are
in
ward
here
this
is
the
token
of
my
authority
and
he
displayed
before
the
eyes
of
the
chief
jailer
the
signet
ring
of
annas
but
the
pharisee
saul
began
the
jailer
caleb
waved
his
hand
impatiently
fetch
the
woman
out
to
me
and
at
once
he
said
they
are
chained
to
the
floor
grumbled
the
jailer
and
i
will
not
fetch
out
any
one
of
them
were
it
by
the
order
of
herod
himself
go
thou
in
so
caleb
went
into
the
prison
the
jailer
following
close
upon
his
heels
which
is
the
woman
called
anna
he
said
i
have
here
a
message
for
her
and
when
the
daughter
of
annas
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
he
thrust
into
her
hand
a
packet
use
what
is
within
to
save
the
honor
of
thy
house
he
whispered
it
is
sent
thee
in
mercy
by
the
hand
of
annas
then
he
turned
swiftly
and
went
out
anna
opened
the
packet
a
vague
hope
stirring
at
her
heart
but
she
shrank
back
with
a
shiver
as
the
flash
of
the
departing
light
fell
upon
the
blade
of
a
dagger
chapter
xxxiv
at
the
third
hour
on
the
morrow
a
great
crowd
had
assembled
about
the
prison
which
held
the
four
who
were
condemned
to
public
scourging
and
to
death
for
evil
tidings
travel
fast
and
there
is
ever
an
ignoble
multitude
who
reckon
as
high
holiday
a
spectacle
of
human
agony
yet
there
were
those
who
looked
in
one
another
s
faces
with
sombre
and
despairing
eyes
the
last
days
are
at
hand
they
murmured
the
days
of
wrath
and
of
burning
for
shall
not
god
avenge
his
own
elect
which
cry
day
and
night
unto
him
yea
he
will
avenge
them
and
that
right
speedily
but
still
the
sun
poured
down
with
impartial
splendor
gilding
alike
the
gloomy
walls
of
the
prison
and
the
yellow
curls
of
the
babe
and
the
placid
heaven
gave
no
sign
of
the
invisible
hosts
of
glory
behind
its
azure
wall
exactly
at
the
third
hour
saul
accompanied
by
a
strong
guard
approached
the
prison
his
face
was
pale
and
haggard
but
upon
it
was
stamped
a
look
of
savage
determination
before
which
the
mob
fell
back
with
a
dull
low
murmur
the
governor
of
the
prison
greeted
him
with
manifest
joy
the
prisoners
which
thou
didst
commit
to
my
charge
are
safe
quite
safe
my
lord
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
we
had
no
visions
neither
angels
earthquakes
nor
demons
we
are
fetch
them
forth
said
saul
with
a
peremptory
gesture
and
a
fierce
look
at
the
jailer
before
which
that
functionary
drew
back
with
an
apologetic
obeisance
yes
certainly
at
once
my
worshipful
lord
just
as
soon
as
we
shall
be
able
to
undo
the
chains
here
you
he
roared
addressing
the
turnkey
fetch
the
four
from
the
inner
prison
so
presently
the
condemned
came
forth
into
the
prison
yard
and
stood
before
saul
their
faces
were
calm
even
joyful
and
the
pharisee
ground
his
teeth
as
he
looked
at
them
hast
thou
counted
the
cost
of
thy
perverseness
he
said
abruptly
we
have
counted
the
cost
replied
mary
of
nazareth
in
a
firm
voice
and
the
reward
is
exceeding
glorious
above
all
that
it
hath
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
to
imagine
thinkest
thou
so
answered
saul
those
of
thy
company
may
be
of
a
better
mind
take
heed
to
what
i
shall
say
he
added
turning
to
the
other
three
the
sanhedrim
is
full
of
mercy
and
compassion
and
while
it
will
without
faltering
carry
on
the
work
which
it
hath
undertaken
of
cleansing
and
purifying
israel
of
this
monstrous
and
blasphemous
belief
in
a
perished
malefactor
it
also
offers
pardon
freely
to
all
who
confess
and
forsake
the
error
of
their
ways
if
now
at
this
last
hour
ye
will
acknowledge
that
the
nazarene
was
an
impostor
inspired
by
the
father
of
lies
that
he
justly
died
the
accursed
death
that
his
body
moreover
was
stolen
by
his
followers
from
out
the
tomb
in
which
it
was
buried
for
the
express
purpose
of
confirming
this
accursed
blasphemy
if
ye
shall
now
make
confession
of
these
things
it
is
the
merciful
mandate
of
them
which
are
in
authority
that
ye
be
immediately
released
without
further
scathe
or
punishment
ye
have
heard
wilt
thou
maiden
so
confess
thereby
securing
to
thyself
bodily
safety
and
the
blessing
of
the
almighty
there
was
a
breathless
silence
for
an
instant
then
anat
raised
her
large
dark
eyes
to
the
face
of
the
pharisee
sir
i
have
heard
thy
offer
of
safety
and
this
is
my
answer
i
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
because
i
who
was
once
blind
now
see
i
believe
that
he
was
put
to
death
upon
the
cross
that
he
might
draw
all
men
unto
him
and
heal
them
from
their
sins
even
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
that
the
stricken
israelites
might
look
and
be
saved
i
believe
that
he
arose
from
among
the
dead
on
the
third
day
and
is
set
down
forever
at
the
right
hand
of
god
these
things
i
do
affirm
and
believe
in
this
the
last
hour
of
my
mortal
life
thou
art
condemned
said
saul
slowly
but
his
face
was
more
white
than
the
face
of
the
maiden
young
man
he
said
turning
to
seth
wilt
thou
confess
to
the
things
which
i
have
already
enumerated
that
thou
mayest
live
out
thy
days
in
peace
i
can
not
deny
him
on
whom
i
have
believed
even
for
the
sake
of
life
and
life
is
sweet
faltered
seth
on
whom
the
shadow
had
lain
very
heavily
all
the
night
thou
art
condemned
repeated
saul
in
a
hollow
voice
woman
who
by
reason
of
thine
exalted
birth
shouldst
have
remained
a
mother
in
israel
wilt
thou
renounce
these
vile
errors
after
which
thou
hast
strayed
in
so
renouncing
thou
shalt
find
again
a
father
s
a
husband
s
forgiveness
and
favor
for
so
i
am
bidden
to
say
unto
thee
anna
trembled
and
was
silent
dost
thou
so
acknowledge
thy
sin
said
saul
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
listened
that
there
was
a
note
of
entreaty
in
his
stern
voice
god
of
my
fathers
cried
the
wife
of
caiaphas
looking
up
into
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
sky
help
me
to
know
without
shadow
of
doubt
what
is
truth
and
enable
me
to
witness
to
it
without
faltering
then
she
turned
to
saul
tell
my
husband
and
my
father
that
the
forgiveness
and
favor
of
god
is
rather
to
be
desired
than
the
forgiveness
and
favor
of
any
mortal
however
beloved
i
believe
that
jesus
of
nazareth
is
the
messiah
of
israel
and
if
i
must
now
die
for
that
belief
i
die
willingly
saul
bowed
his
head
without
speaking
close
up
about
the
prisoners
he
commanded
the
guard
who
had
stood
silent
witnesses
of
the
scene
and
conduct
them
to
the
place
of
punishment
abu
ben
hesed
had
not
been
idle
during
the
hours
which
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
the
prisoners
disappear
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
judgment
hall
he
had
followed
them
to
the
prison
and
from
a
temple
underling
who
was
not
insensible
to
the
glitter
of
gold
as
seen
through
the
fingers
of
the
desert
chief
he
had
made
shift
to
find
out
the
number
of
guards
the
strength
of
the
walls
and
the
general
plan
of
the
prison
a
safe
prison
truly
he
said
to
his
informant
as
the
gold
changed
hands
neither
apparently
being
aware
of
the
transaction
safe
as
the
tomb
assented
the
temple
official
slyly
rubbing
the
coin
with
a
corner
of
his
robe
once
within
yonder
walls
a
man
is
seen
no
more
till
he
is
fetched
out
then
he
fell
to
eying
the
hand
of
ben
hesed
fancying
that
he
again
saw
there
a
gleam
of
something
yellow
he
was
not
mistaken
and
his
face
grew
proportionately
genial
as
a
second
coin
joined
the
first
in
his
own
greedy
palm
i
am
but
lately
arrived
in
jerusalem
said
ben
hesed
and
have
as
yet
not
witnessed
the
punishment
of
any
of
these
apostates
twere
a
goodly
sight
to
see
a
blasphemer
suffer
ay
a
goodly
sight
i
have
seen
many
man
but
they
be
obstinate
wouldst
thou
witness
a
grand
spectacle
then
be
without
the
damascus
gate
twill
be
in
the
very
place
where
they
stoned
the
pestilent
gentile
stephen
they
will
stone
only
the
man
i
suppose
said
ben
hesed
with
apparent
unconcern
they
will
scourge
all
four
forty
stripes
save
one
and
the
fellow
smacked
his
lips
in
anticipation
i
myself
am
to
handle
one
of
the
scourges
and
i
understand
the
business
as
none
other
in
jerusalem
i
can
fetch
the
blood
every
time
thou
wilt
see
and
he
winked
at
ben
hesed
and
cautiously
clinked
the
gold
pieces
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
at
peace
with
himself
and
all
the
world
ben
hesed
could
with
difficulty
keep
his
hands
from
the
throat
of
the
wretch
after
the
scourging
the
sanhedrim
will
give
them
one
more
chance
to
renounce
their
evil
beliefs
continued
the
official
a
mere
form
for
they
are
all
as
stubborn
as
the
father
of
lies
himself
a
few
stones
will
suffice
to
finish
them
so
perish
all
who
blaspheme
the
law
i
shall
be
there
declared
ben
hesed
ah
stay
should
they
change
the
hour
and
place
bring
me
word
and
i
will
recompense
thee
with
as
much
again
as
thou
hast
already
in
thy
hand
i
am
not
minded
to
lose
the
sight
thou
wilt
find
me
encamped
just
without
the
damascus
gate
i
will
bring
thee
word
son
of
abraham
i
swear
it
by
the
veil
of
the
temple
peace
be
with
thee
an
hour
later
ben
hesed
held
a
council
of
war
in
his
camp
we
can
not
take
the
prison
he
said
drawing
his
heavy
brows
together
for
they
would
straightway
rouse
the
romans
at
the
citadel
which
is
but
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
outer
wall
of
the
place
we
must
wait
till
they
fetch
them
out
and
may
the
almighty
give
us
the
wisdom
and
the
strength
which
we
need
ay
and
he
will
give
it
he
added
his
eye
flashing
fire
it
is
ever
the
pleasure
of
jehovah
to
show
forth
his
power
by
the
hand
of
the
few
even
as
by
the
hand
of
gideon
with
three
hundred
men
he
overthrew
the
hosts
of
the
midianites
and
amalekites
which
were
as
the
grasshoppers
for
multitude
then
directed
he
the
twelve
men
who
were
with
him
after
what
manner
they
should
do
on
the
morrow
and
every
man
of
them
lay
down
and
slept
but
ben
hesed
slept
not
all
the
night
for
he
prayed
mightily
unto
god
that
he
would
deliver
them
which
were
persecuted
out
of
the
hand
of
the
destroyer
and
he
prayed
also
for
him
that
was
wasting
the
church
that
his
eyes
might
be
opened
at
the
coming
of
the
dawn
he
also
laid
down
for
a
space
for
he
said
i
will
both
lay
me
down
in
peace
and
sleep
for
thou
lord
only
makest
me
to
dwell
in
safety
the
lord
will
save
the
afflicted
people
he
will
give
me
the
necks
of
his
enemies
for
god
is
a
god
of
great
deliverances
very
early
the
people
began
to
pour
out
from
the
damascus
gate
that
they
might
secure
good
places
for
the
seeing
they
brought
with
them
food
and
drink
also
that
they
might
make
merry
ben
hesed
looked
at
them
and
he
waxed
exceeding
angry
behold
he
said
these
dwellers
in
the
holy
city
are
come
out
as
to
a
holiday
with
laughing
and
feasting
they
are
become
as
the
dwellers
in
sodom
and
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
before
the
flood
for
they
delight
themselves
in
blood
and
in
violence
they
make
merry
and
eat
and
drink
but
the
days
shall
come
wherein
they
shall
mourn
and
cry
aloud
and
their
tears
shall
be
their
meat
day
and
night
as
the
third
hour
drew
nigh
the
people
began
to
crane
their
necks
toward
the
gate
through
which
the
condemned
were
to
come
forth
and
they
grew
impatient
and
murmured
as
the
moments
dragged
by
what
now
if
they
have
already
confessed
said
one
woman
we
shall
have
put
ourselves
to
this
trouble
for
naught
nay
but
i
believe
that
they
have
confessed
mayhap
said
her
neighbor
but
i
shall
not
give
up
the
matter
before
noon
now
that
i
am
here
verily
she
added
with
a
shrug
i
am
glad
now
that
i
did
not
go
over
to
their
number
i
came
near
it
once
when
the
man
peter
preached
in
our
street
that
their
messiah
would
come
back
and
that
right
speedily
if
what
they
tell
about
the
nazarene
being
alive
were
true
he
would
certainly
come
in
these
days
then
they
fell
to
gossiping
in
neighborly
fashion
about
their
husbands
the
linen
that
they
had
spun
and
the
preparations
for
the
approaching
stopping
suddenly
to
listen
as
a
loud
and
ever
growing
murmur
of
sound
arose
from
within
the
gates
they
are
coming
cried
the
multitude
as
with
one
voice
they
are
coming
said
ben
hesed
tightening
his
grasp
on
the
strong
bow
upon
which
he
was
leaning
the
little
band
of
fourteen
men
had
established
themselves
on
a
rocky
eminence
directly
above
the
spot
where
the
scourging
was
to
take
place
well
screened
from
observation
by
a
tangle
of
shrubs
the
procession
headed
by
a
strong
detachment
of
temple
guards
soon
came
in
sight
the
prisoners
heavily
chained
walking
two
by
two
behind
them
followed
a
number
of
sanhedrists
among
whom
the
women
pointed
out
to
one
another
the
famous
saul
of
tarsus
as
second
only
in
interest
to
the
condemned
prisoners
they
do
say
whispered
one
that
he
enters
without
ceremony
into
the
houses
wherein
dwell
them
that
believe
on
the
nazarene
and
that
he
drags
them
forth
to
prison
and
to
death
without
mercy
that
is
true
returned
her
neighbor
i
chanced
to
be
in
the
house
of
mary
when
he
came
there
for
as
thou
knowest
she
was
a
kind
soul
whatever
her
sins
and
ready
always
to
lend
from
her
store
for
the
convenience
of
them
that
lacked
indeed
one
might
say
as
much
of
them
all
and
how
didst
thou
escape
i
simply
repeated
what
the
man
bade
me
without
ado
but
i
had
like
to
have
fainted
how
i
reached
my
home
afterward
i
scarce
know
my
husband
hath
forbidden
me
to
speak
with
any
of
them
hereafter
though
god
knows
the
command
was
needless
but
see
they
are
about
to
bind
them
to
the
posts
for
the
scourging
at
the
next
breath
the
speaker
screamed
aloud
in
terror
grasping
her
neighbor
by
the
arm
a
swift
something
had
smitten
the
man
who
was
advancing
to
lay
hold
on
mary
of
nazareth
and
with
a
wild
yell
of
agony
he
leapt
high
into
the
air
falling
stone
dead
at
his
victim
s
feet
before
the
startled
multitude
had
time
to
recover
themselves
a
very
whirlwind
of
destruction
savage
swift
merciless
had
swept
down
upon
them
from
the
rocky
eminence
above
their
heads
the
wild
of
the
desert
sounding
in
their
guilty
ears
like
the
trumpet
call
of
the
last
day
and
the
people
fled
from
before
it
in
a
frenzy
of
mad
fear
running
stumbling
falling
the
strong
trampling
the
weak
under
foot
amid
a
wild
tumult
of
shrieks
curses
and
entreaties
to
god
to
spare
them
the
temple
guard
encouraged
by
the
ringing
voice
of
saul
of
tarsus
made
at
the
first
some
faint
show
of
resistance
then
they
too
turned
and
fled
for
their
lives
cowards
shouted
saul
angrily
there
are
but
a
handful
of
them
but
his
voice
was
drowned
in
the
general
uproar
seizing
a
spear
from
the
hand
of
one
of
the
flying
guard
he
flung
himself
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
striking
out
right
and
left
in
a
sort
of
blind
fury
then
something
struck
him
full
in
the
forehead
a
wave
as
of
fire
flashed
before
his
eyes
the
spear
dropped
from
his
nerveless
fingers
and
he
fell
down
down
into
darkness
and
silence
chapter
xxxv
on
the
road
to
damascus
neighbor
dost
think
it
is
safe
for
us
to
come
down
verily
for
myself
i
shall
take
the
risk
if
risk
there
be
for
my
limbs
are
as
stiff
as
those
of
yonder
dead
man
by
way
of
answer
the
other
man
shook
a
warning
finger
at
the
speaker
and
proceeded
to
clamber
up
still
further
into
the
branches
of
the
tree
in
which
these
two
spectators
of
the
stirring
scene
which
had
just
transpired
were
hidden
wait
a
little
he
whispered
till
i
shall
make
sure
that
the
fellows
have
gone
by
the
thunderbolts
of
jove
he
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
as
he
presently
descended
to
a
level
with
his
companion
that
was
a
greater
sight
than
the
stoning
which
we
came
out
to
see
i
would
not
have
missed
it
no
not
for
ten
shekels
of
silver
have
they
gone
said
the
first
querulously
i
tell
thee
that
my
limbs
have
lost
all
feeling
so
long
have
i
sat
here
without
moving
thou
mayest
thank
the
gods
that
thou
art
alive
to
complain
friend
but
come
down
come
down
there
is
naught
to
hurt
thee
now
and
we
must
look
to
these
dead
men
who
were
the
rescuers
thinkest
thou
nay
i
know
not
there
were
thirteen
of
them
for
i
counted
verily
i
believe
that
the
multitude
thought
them
the
twelve
apostles
headed
by
the
nazarene
himself
and
the
speaker
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
again
nay
there
were
fourteen
said
the
other
with
an
obstinate
shake
of
the
head
i
also
counted
and
i
never
make
a
mistake
they
were
wild
men
out
of
the
desert
i
opine
he
added
sagely
i
have
seen
the
like
many
times
when
crossing
to
egypt
for
i
have
traveled
in
my
day
then
he
looked
anxiously
about
him
there
is
no
one
dead
here
save
the
man
yonder
he
said
and
he
was
smitten
at
the
first
we
had
best
make
haste
and
return
to
the
city
this
affair
is
nothing
to
us
hold
dost
thou
not
see
a
body
yonder
in
the
shadow
of
the
bush
by
the
rod
of
moses
i
think
i
saw
him
move
let
us
look
to
it
we
had
best
leave
the
whole
matter
alone
i
tell
thee
insisted
his
companion
with
irritation
thanks
be
to
jehovah
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
so
far
save
to
look
on
and
i
tell
thee
that
i
will
not
lay
a
finger
to
yonder
body
be
it
dead
or
alive
come
i
am
going
to
the
city
and
without
stopping
for
further
parley
the
speaker
began
to
run
toward
the
city
gate
apparently
not
hearing
the
loud
cries
to
stop
which
his
companion
sent
after
him
coward
muttered
the
one
who
was
left
then
he
walked
over
to
the
body
which
lay
face
downward
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushes
and
deliberately
turned
it
over
starting
back
with
a
cry
of
surprise
as
the
identity
of
the
unconscious
man
became
apparent
tis
saul
of
tarsus
so
the
wolf
is
himself
bitten
for
once
but
not
unto
death
i
am
thinking
he
sprinkled
the
face
of
the
wounded
man
with
water
and
forced
a
little
wine
between
his
clenched
teeth
only
a
bruise
he
continued
reflectively
as
he
examined
the
body
with
care
i
suspect
that
the
nazarenes
would
thank
me
should
i
thrust
him
through
as
he
lies
he
is
a
hard
man
a
hard
man
yet
that
is
nothing
to
me
ha
he
is
reviving
already
another
sip
of
the
wine
friend
thou
hadst
a
sharp
blow
and
it
hath
confused
thy
senses
somewhat
but
thou
wilt
shortly
did
the
blasphemers
escape
me
said
saul
in
a
hollow
voice
sitting
up
and
looking
about
him
then
his
eye
fell
upon
the
four
empty
posts
which
had
been
set
up
for
the
scourging
and
he
groaned
aloud
be
thankful
rather
that
thou
hast
thyself
escaped
with
so
slight
an
injury
said
the
man
who
still
stood
at
his
side
flask
in
hand
another
sup
of
hold
thy
peace
fellow
said
saul
savagely
springing
to
his
feet
the
cowardly
knaves
to
flee
from
their
duty
before
a
dozen
peasants
where
are
they
which
way
did
they
go
and
he
fixed
his
angry
eyes
on
his
rescuer
who
was
calmly
girding
himself
thou
hast
bidden
me
hold
my
peace
pharisee
and
i
am
not
the
man
to
be
bidden
twice
farewell
and
a
good
recovery
to
thee
and
the
man
turned
resolutely
away
stay
friend
i
should
not
have
spoken
thus
to
one
who
had
done
me
a
kindness
said
saul
grant
me
thy
pardon
and
tell
me
i
beseech
thee
what
thou
canst
of
this
affair
if
thou
wast
witness
to
it
god
knows
that
it
was
untimely
another
hour
might
have
seen
four
penitent
ones
restored
to
the
fold
of
israel
thinkest
thou
so
pharisee
said
the
other
carelessly
now
for
myself
i
think
otherwise
another
hour
would
have
seen
four
corpses
yonder
where
now
we
see
but
one
the
affair
was
timely
enough
for
the
nazarenes
thy
name
man
my
name
pharisee
is
festus
i
am
a
roman
resident
of
jerusalem
yonder
for
a
score
of
years
back
but
answerable
to
no
man
for
my
beliefs
or
practices
if
it
pleaseth
me
to
believe
on
a
crucified
man
instead
of
on
jove
or
jehovah
thou
canst
neither
scourge
nor
stone
me
for
it
and
now
most
courteous
rabbi
let
me
advise
thee
to
return
with
all
haste
into
jerusalem
and
in
future
to
moderate
thy
zeal
lest
thou
come
to
an
untimely
end
with
which
bit
of
advice
received
by
saul
in
contemptuous
silence
the
man
strode
away
toward
jerusalem
left
to
himself
the
baffled
pharisee
examined
the
ground
carefully
pausing
at
length
to
question
several
peasants
who
had
left
their
work
in
the
neighboring
fields
to
gather
at
the
scene
of
the
disaster
didst
thou
see
which
way
the
knaves
fled
he
asked
of
one
the
man
looked
at
him
stupidly
they
be
fled
along
the
road
yonder
he
said
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
highway
which
way
north
or
south
they
went
that
way
master
said
the
peasant
pointing
toward
the
north
which
was
indeed
the
opposite
direction
from
that
which
ben
hesed
and
his
company
had
taken
he
asked
me
which
way
the
knaves
were
fled
said
the
man
to
his
companions
as
they
stood
staring
after
the
departing
figure
of
saul
assuredly
the
knaves
who
came
out
to
look
upon
the
death
of
the
just
went
that
way
since
it
took
them
back
to
jerusalem
as
for
the
nazarenes
and
those
that
saved
them
this
day
god
be
with
them
i
did
not
look
to
see
which
way
they
fled
jehovah
grant
them
a
swift
journey
and
a
safe
from
the
hand
of
that
pestilent
pharisee
thou
hast
spoken
cried
the
others
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
after
which
they
went
peacefully
back
to
their
labors
in
the
meantime
saul
was
hastening
back
to
jerusalem
with
rage
in
his
heart
bruised
baffled
humiliated
as
he
was
he
lost
no
time
in
seeking
annas
that
he
might
acquaint
him
with
the
untoward
occurrence
of
the
morning
i
will
pursue
them
he
said
even
unto
strange
cities
within
this
hour
will
i
set
forth
annas
looked
thoughtful
thou
sayest
he
said
that
they
be
fled
towards
the
north
it
hath
come
to
my
ears
of
late
that
there
be
many
of
these
accursed
apostates
who
have
taken
refuge
in
damascus
so
that
there
is
now
a
goodly
company
of
them
dwelling
in
fancied
security
in
that
city
waxing
fat
and
flourishing
as
doth
this
pestilent
weed
of
evil
wherever
it
taketh
root
the
men
who
have
this
day
interfered
with
the
just
sentence
of
the
law
have
doubtless
accomplished
the
mischief
through
the
connivance
of
some
person
who
hath
played
traitor
to
the
cause
and
are
now
fled
to
damascus
thinking
to
find
there
a
refuge
from
the
wrath
of
israel
who
is
the
traitor
annas
hesitated
for
an
instant
there
be
foes
among
them
of
a
man
s
own
household
in
these
days
he
said
in
a
half
whisper
caiaphas
hath
disappeared
i
know
not
whither
but
i
fear
i
fear
damascus
is
under
aretas
emir
of
petra
now
said
saul
after
a
pause
with
him
thy
house
hath
friendly
relations
give
me
therefore
letters
that
i
may
carry
fire
and
the
sword
into
the
camp
of
jehovah
s
enemies
i
will
not
let
so
much
as
one
of
them
escape
me
and
he
ground
his
teeth
savagely
i
will
fetch
them
chained
to
jerusalem
that
they
may
perish
in
sight
of
the
walls
which
they
have
dishonored
thou
hast
spoken
wisely
and
well
my
son
i
will
procure
the
letters
for
thee
at
once
so
that
thou
mayest
start
without
delay
as
for
matters
in
this
city
there
shall
be
no
sparing
of
pains
nor
effort
to
carry
on
to
its
completion
the
good
work
which
we
have
begun
jehovah
hath
prospered
us
mightily
so
far
we
hear
of
no
more
blasphemous
gatherings
in
solomon
s
porch
no
more
preaching
of
a
false
messiah
in
the
synagogues
no
more
healing
of
vile
beggars
in
the
name
of
the
accursed
one
no
further
prating
about
apostles
or
disciples
men
walk
soberly
in
these
days
as
they
have
not
since
the
days
of
the
malefactor
let
us
continue
in
this
good
cause
my
son
and
we
shall
have
triumphed
gloriously
this
disgraceful
heresy
which
is
even
as
a
spot
of
foul
leprosy
on
the
fair
body
of
israel
shall
be
utterly
purged
away
then
indeed
may
we
hope
once
more
for
the
coming
of
the
anointed
one
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
flashed
fire
amen
and
amen
he
cried
may
jehovah
hasten
the
day
but
his
brow
was
gloomy
and
forbidding
as
ever
when
an
hour
later
he
had
finished
the
visitation
of
the
prisons
wherein
groaned
many
that
believed
neither
scourgings
threatenings
revilings
nor
torture
of
any
degree
hath
the
power
to
move
these
nazarenes
declared
the
and
the
women
yield
no
whit
easier
than
the
men
a
spot
of
leprosy
indeed
muttered
saul
to
himself
it
hath
by
stealth
crept
into
the
very
of
the
nation
and
how
hardly
shall
the
deadly
leprosy
be
cleansed
another
hour
and
he
was
in
the
saddle
pressing
forward
with
all
haste
towards
damascus
for
he
hoped
to
overtake
the
fugitives
before
night
with
him
traveled
a
escort
of
tried
and
experienced
men
to
whom
had
been
promised
large
rewards
should
the
mission
be
successful
the
journey
to
damascus
was
a
long
one
the
roads
were
rough
and
moreover
so
that
progress
was
necessarily
slow
hasten
as
he
might
saul
could
not
hope
to
reach
damascus
before
the
better
part
of
a
week
as
for
them
that
had
escaped
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
were
still
before
him
now
and
again
he
heard
from
the
khans
along
his
route
of
a
troop
of
horsemen
with
whom
were
traveling
also
women
but
when
on
the
third
day
he
actually
overtook
such
a
company
of
wayfarers
it
turned
out
to
be
merely
a
caravan
of
wine
merchants
traveling
with
their
wives
and
little
ones
i
will
at
all
events
press
on
to
damascus
he
decided
for
even
should
i
not
immediately
lay
hand
upon
the
ones
i
seek
there
are
in
that
city
other
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
which
i
must
needs
bring
back
into
the
fold
on
this
journey
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
saul
found
time
to
think
habitually
taciturn
and
forbidding
his
subordinates
did
not
venture
to
address
the
haughty
pharisee
save
when
it
became
necessary
so
for
long
hours
the
man
sat
silent
while
his
beast
picked
its
slow
and
difficult
way
along
the
rocky
roads
strangely
enough
his
thoughts
wandered
again
and
again
from
the
object
of
his
journey
in
these
vernal
solitudes
the
wily
words
of
annas
faded
from
his
mind
something
in
the
flowers
that
leaned
in
shy
welcome
from
the
roadside
grass
put
him
in
mind
of
stephen
the
dead
apostate
as
he
bitterly
termed
him
before
his
mental
vision
there
arose
again
that
face
now
radiant
with
the
fire
of
youth
and
enthusiasm
as
he
remembered
it
in
many
a
heated
debate
over
law
and
prophecy
now
stern
and
unrelenting
as
he
pronounced
the
terrible
arraignment
which
yet
echoed
in
the
ears
of
the
pharisee
ye
and
uncircumcised
in
heart
and
ears
ye
do
always
resist
the
holy
ghost
as
your
fathers
did
so
do
ye
which
of
the
prophets
have
not
your
fathers
persecuted
and
they
have
slain
them
which
shewed
before
the
coming
of
the
just
one
of
whom
ye
have
now
become
the
betrayers
and
murderers
then
pallid
beneath
the
icy
shadow
of
approaching
death
yet
shining
with
a
mysterious
glory
as
he
cried
out
behold
i
see
the
heavens
opened
and
the
son
of
man
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
power
and
yet
again
touched
with
the
mystic
seal
of
the
great
deliverer
as
he
had
lain
asleep
on
the
stony
ground
beyond
the
damascus
gate
in
vain
did
he
endeavor
to
shake
off
these
haunting
visions
resolutely
repeating
aloud
commands
prohibitions
and
long
passages
of
the
law
rigorously
observing
the
ceremonial
washings
and
cleansings
whenever
the
company
halted
beside
a
running
stream
all
was
in
vain
ye
who
received
the
law
as
it
was
ordained
by
angels
and
kept
it
not
sounded
the
inexorable
voice
and
with
and
through
it
mingled
the
wail
of
women
bereft
of
their
little
ones
the
groanings
of
strong
men
beneath
the
scourge
the
sullen
clang
of
prison
doors
and
the
clank
of
chains
on
the
fifth
night
of
his
journey
the
agony
became
so
intolerable
that
he
left
his
tent
and
wandered
out
beneath
the
open
heavens
my
god
he
groaned
aloud
have
i
not
kept
thy
law
and
loved
thy
statutes
yet
have
i
no
peace
my
days
are
consumed
with
anguish
surely
thou
hast
hated
iniquity
and
thou
hast
loved
righteousness
behold
now
i
have
done
all
these
things
that
thy
name
might
be
exalted
before
the
people
that
blasphemy
and
deceit
might
cease
from
out
the
land
and
he
vowed
a
great
sacrifice
before
the
lord
of
fat
sheep
and
oxen
but
again
came
the
haunting
voice
o
ye
house
of
israel
have
ye
offered
to
me
slain
beasts
and
sacrifices
for
the
space
of
forty
years
but
behold
i
will
carry
you
away
beyond
babylon
who
have
received
the
law
ordained
of
angels
and
have
kept
it
not
i
have
kept
the
law
he
cried
aloud
and
the
hills
replied
in
melancholy
echoes
the
law
the
law
then
there
crowded
into
his
thought
the
faces
of
the
four
who
had
escaped
out
of
his
hand
and
he
remembered
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
maiden
as
she
said
i
believe
that
he
was
put
to
death
upon
the
cross
that
he
might
draw
all
men
unto
him
and
heal
them
from
their
sins
even
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
that
the
stricken
israelites
might
look
and
be
saved
and
with
these
words
there
mingled
the
solemn
voices
of
prophecy
surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
yet
we
did
esteem
him
stricken
smitten
of
god
and
afflicted
but
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
he
was
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
upon
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
god
if
it
be
true
he
murmured
and
for
a
moment
the
soft
radiance
of
that
ever
brooding
presence
of
love
had
well
nigh
penetrated
his
dark
soul
then
he
lifted
his
head
stubbornly
i
can
not
believe
he
cried
i
will
not
shall
i
a
pharisee
of
the
pharisees
accept
a
messiah
who
hath
died
the
accursed
death
i
am
mad
i
will
not
believe
unless
i
too
can
see
the
heavens
opened
he
laughed
aloud
as
he
spoke
the
words
and
the
sound
of
his
laughter
fled
away
through
the
silent
night
to
the
dark
hills
which
caught
it
and
tossed
it
back
upon
him
in
mocking
echoes
on
the
morrow
they
journeyed
in
the
plains
of
a
vast
arid
burning
desert
wherein
was
neither
water
nor
verdure
and
the
men
and
the
beasts
were
parched
by
reason
of
the
great
heat
certain
ones
of
the
company
therefore
besought
saul
that
they
might
tarry
by
the
way
let
us
rest
till
the
heat
of
the
day
be
past
they
said
then
shall
we
with
ease
reach
the
village
of
kaukab
there
will
we
abide
till
morning
that
we
may
enter
damascus
before
the
hour
of
the
great
heat
we
will
not
tarry
replied
saul
until
we
reach
damascus
and
there
was
that
in
his
eye
which
forbade
remonstrance
so
they
toiled
on
silently
beneath
the
burning
syrian
sky
the
village
of
kaukab
which
is
being
interpreted
the
village
of
the
star
was
reached
and
passed
and
now
before
them
lay
the
city
of
damascus
in
all
its
beauty
the
city
of
the
paradise
of
god
for
so
has
it
been
called
in
every
age
embowered
in
gardens
of
palm
and
roses
its
walls
and
towers
of
snowy
whiteness
shining
like
a
handful
of
pearls
in
a
goblet
of
emerald
a
land
of
flowing
streams
a
city
of
cool
fountains
set
like
a
bit
of
heaven
in
the
midst
of
a
barren
and
thirsty
land
the
exhausted
wayfarers
paused
for
a
moment
that
they
might
feast
their
eyes
upon
the
beauty
of
the
scene
but
saul
with
an
imperative
gesture
bade
them
hasten
we
are
not
come
to
damascus
as
one
who
journeyeth
for
his
pleasure
he
cried
savagely
we
seek
the
blood
of
them
that
confess
the
accursed
jesus
but
even
as
he
spoke
the
sacred
name
some
invisible
power
smote
him
to
the
earth
and
a
great
light
brighter
even
than
the
fierce
shining
of
the
noonday
sun
blazed
round
about
him
in
the
midst
of
this
terrible
light
he
beheld
a
form
upon
which
he
gazed
appalled
then
was
there
the
sound
of
a
voice
and
the
words
were
these
saul
saul
why
persecutest
thou
me
true
to
the
utter
fearlessness
of
his
soul
the
man
also
has
a
question
to
ask
who
art
thou
lord
and
the
answer
came
clear
and
decisive
i
am
jesus
whom
thou
persecutest
it
is
hard
for
thee
to
kick
against
the
pricks
then
indeed
did
the
strong
man
tremble
and
he
made
answer
from
out
the
depths
of
his
soul
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
arise
go
into
the
city
and
it
shall
be
told
thee
what
thou
must
do
the
majestic
presence
was
gone
the
light
faded
to
the
light
of
an
earthly
noontide
yet
saul
still
lay
upon
his
face
in
the
dust
of
the
damascus
road
the
men
that
journeyed
with
him
stood
speechless
staring
at
one
another
with
livid
faces
they
had
seen
the
blazing
light
they
had
heard
the
strange
and
awful
sound
of
a
voice
but
their
eyes
had
been
holden
to
the
vision
of
the
glorified
jesus
presently
saul
arose
from
the
earth
the
first
command
of
his
lord
ringing
in
his
ears
arise
go
into
the
city
but
when
he
opened
his
eyes
that
he
might
obey
the
words
he
opened
them
upon
darkness
he
was
blind
and
they
led
him
by
the
hand
and
brought
him
into
damascus
chapter
xxxvi
the
amulet
it
was
high
noon
in
the
desert
encampment
the
shadows
of
the
palms
which
had
boldly
displayed
themselves
in
the
early
cool
of
the
morning
had
gradually
retreated
before
the
triumphant
progress
of
the
sun
till
now
they
lay
a
shrunken
heap
about
the
slender
stems
of
the
trees
which
in
their
turn
scarcely
dared
murmur
to
their
children
of
the
coming
hours
when
the
burning
tyrant
overhead
should
again
be
brought
low
and
the
shadows
reign
triumphant
through
the
shimmering
air
came
the
insistent
voice
of
dropping
water
telling
over
and
over
again
of
great
depths
of
refreshing
hid
away
in
the
secret
places
of
the
rock
safe
from
the
thirsty
ball
of
fire
above
safe
from
the
hungry
sands
which
crept
uneasily
to
and
fro
about
the
rocky
margin
of
the
fountain
the
camels
crouched
in
the
meagre
shade
their
large
eyes
half
closed
they
heard
and
understood
both
the
faint
murmur
of
the
palms
and
the
voice
of
the
water
therefore
were
they
silent
being
satisfied
but
from
within
the
tent
of
goat
s
hair
close
at
hand
there
came
the
sound
of
voices
these
men
grunted
an
old
camel
they
be
forever
making
a
noise
with
their
mouths
why
can
not
they
be
silent
and
look
and
listen
as
do
we
this
is
what
the
voices
were
saying
god
is
good
my
husband
and
as
yet
i
have
scarce
had
room
in
my
soul
for
more
than
the
sense
of
that
goodness
which
hath
snatched
me
from
the
jaws
of
death
and
with
life
hath
also
restored
to
me
the
more
precious
treasure
of
thy
love
tell
me
how
it
chanced
that
thou
hadst
a
hand
in
our
rescue
it
is
not
unknown
to
thee
beloved
how
that
for
many
months
my
soul
was
a
very
hell
of
fear
and
remorse
i
was
i
knew
that
upon
my
head
rested
the
blood
of
an
innocent
man
nay
more
i
knew
in
my
inmost
soul
that
my
crime
was
yet
more
deadly
that
i
even
i
had
condemned
to
an
accursed
death
the
very
son
of
god
yes
i
believed
but
alas
it
was
even
as
the
devils
who
believe
and
tremble
and
yet
are
devils
still
i
cast
thee
forth
because
thou
didst
also
believe
i
wretch
that
i
was
did
pronounce
upon
thee
a
curse
then
my
angel
fled
and
the
curse
recoiled
upon
mine
own
head
i
will
not
tell
thee
i
can
not
how
i
tried
to
strangle
the
misery
in
my
soul
how
i
flung
myself
heart
and
strength
into
the
deadly
persecutions
against
them
that
believed
all
the
while
with
the
mean
hope
that
the
fire
would
drive
thee
back
from
the
heavenly
path
which
thou
wast
climbing
into
the
black
road
down
which
i
was
plunging
alone
i
saw
and
gloried
in
the
death
of
stephen
i
gloated
over
the
agonies
of
them
that
suffered
beneath
the
scourge
i
outdid
saul
of
tarsus
in
the
work
of
denouncing
men
and
women
whose
only
crime
it
was
to
believe
on
god
manifest
in
the
flesh
there
is
a
hell
for
i
have
sojourned
there
one
day
i
was
told
that
thou
wast
in
prison
that
on
the
morrow
thou
wouldst
be
scourged
stoned
issachar
himself
told
me
with
an
air
of
mock
sympathy
she
is
less
to
me
i
declared
to
him
coldly
than
the
stones
beneath
my
but
i
lied
when
i
said
it
that
night
i
begged
annas
on
my
knees
to
have
mercy
i
will
have
mercy
he
said
i
will
send
a
message
to
the
woman
within
the
hour
and
he
called
caleb
i
waylaid
the
man
and
offered
him
gold
to
show
me
the
message
he
showed
it
me
that
night
i
went
to
my
chamber
resolved
to
die
before
the
light
of
another
day
but
each
time
that
i
lifted
the
dagger
to
my
breast
something
seemed
to
hold
my
hand
at
last
i
flung
it
from
me
and
sank
upon
my
knees
crying
aloud
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
again
and
again
i
repeated
the
words
till
at
last
there
came
into
my
soul
a
great
peace
god
was
merciful
i
knew
i
felt
it
and
then
and
there
i
made
confession
of
all
my
guilt
before
him
i
am
guilty
of
the
blood
of
him
whom
thou
didst
send
to
save
me
i
cried
yet
he
prayed
in
his
last
agony
saying
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
i
rose
up
forgiven
and
the
morning
dawned
i
will
go
i
said
to
the
place
where
she
is
to
suffer
and
there
before
them
all
i
will
make
confession
of
my
guilt
and
my
belief
then
shall
i
die
but
when
i
had
come
to
the
place
outside
the
damascus
gate
very
early
for
i
could
not
wait
i
fell
in
with
the
man
ben
hesed
and
because
my
soul
was
full
even
to
overflowing
i
told
him
all
i
will
die
i
said
with
nay
he
cried
rather
must
thou
live
that
thou
mayest
overlay
the
wickedness
of
the
past
with
the
pure
gold
of
thou
knowest
the
rest
beloved
then
the
voices
ceased
for
a
space
and
the
sound
of
the
falling
water
again
filled
the
stillness
that
evening
when
the
shadows
were
displaying
themselves
once
more
in
triumph
and
the
voice
of
the
fountain
had
sunken
to
a
low
murmur
because
of
the
more
insistent
voices
of
the
women
who
were
filling
their
jars
at
its
cool
brim
ben
hesed
held
converse
with
them
whom
he
had
snatched
from
death
their
talk
was
sweet
and
comforting
as
of
those
whose
feet
had
trod
the
margin
of
the
river
of
death
from
whose
hither
bank
the
traveler
can
hear
faint
echoes
of
the
heavenly
melodies
of
the
redeemed
and
where
every
breeze
wafts
the
perfume
of
the
blossoming
tree
of
life
it
is
good
to
have
been
near
death
said
mary
of
nazareth
because
it
is
good
to
have
touched
the
boundary
of
the
life
more
abundant
there
is
no
terror
to
them
that
believe
on
him
that
hath
conquered
death
he
that
believeth
hath
everlasting
afterward
while
the
day
merged
slowly
into
the
night
they
told
ben
hesed
of
all
that
happened
to
them
since
he
had
left
them
in
jerusalem
of
the
last
days
of
stephen
of
his
death
and
burial
of
that
stern
enemy
saul
of
tarsus
and
his
unrelenting
hatred
of
them
that
believed
nay
said
anat
after
a
pause
i
know
that
he
would
have
rejoiced
truly
had
we
but
confessed
as
he
bade
us
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
was
not
all
hatred
perchance
god
is
leading
him
into
peace
by
some
sure
way
of
his
own
even
as
he
led
the
egyptian
amu
surely
god
s
ways
are
unsearchable
that
is
a
true
word
said
ben
hesed
musingly
but
tell
me
of
the
egyptian
amu
so
anat
told
him
how
that
he
had
rescued
stephen
from
death
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
together
with
all
the
story
of
their
own
wrong
at
his
hands
i
would
that
god
had
given
him
one
more
breath
said
the
girl
sighing
for
then
would
he
have
told
us
the
name
of
our
mother
s
kindred
ben
hesed
looked
at
the
clear
profile
of
the
girl
as
she
sat
looking
away
into
the
afterglow
which
still
burned
dully
at
the
horizon
and
a
haunting
memory
of
the
past
suddenly
awakened
in
his
breast
hast
thou
aught
that
belonged
to
thy
mother
maiden
he
said
and
there
was
a
strange
thrill
in
his
voice
i
had
anklets
of
wrought
silver
when
i
came
out
of
egypt
said
anat
slowly
without
turning
her
head
also
a
necklace
of
coins
but
when
i
was
healed
of
my
blindness
i
made
an
offering
of
these
baubles
to
the
lord
s
poor
it
was
all
that
i
had
to
give
then
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
kept
but
one
piece
from
the
necklace
i
thought
that
i
should
like
that
one
small
bit
of
my
mother
s
past
it
is
a
strange
coin
show
it
to
me
said
ben
hesed
without
a
word
anat
took
from
off
her
neck
the
slender
chain
of
wrought
silver
from
which
hung
the
one
token
that
bound
her
to
an
unknown
past
ben
hesed
took
it
his
iron
fingers
trembling
like
those
of
a
woman
in
that
simple
amulet
lay
a
strange
power
for
no
sooner
had
he
examined
it
in
the
fading
light
than
all
else
before
his
bodily
eyes
vanished
it
was
a
bright
morning
now
and
the
sun
was
shining
merrily
on
a
caravan
of
strangers
out
of
egypt
he
was
trading
with
them
horses
and
sheep
and
cheeses
of
goat
s
milk
receiving
in
exchange
bales
of
cloth
and
divers
weapons
of
war
together
with
utensils
of
wrought
brass
and
jars
of
pottery
give
me
also
the
horse
said
the
chief
merchant
pointing
to
the
animal
which
ben
hesed
himself
bestrode
i
will
give
thee
for
it
a
bale
of
scarlet
and
another
of
fine
linen
for
thy
women
women
of
the
desert
do
not
wear
scarlet
nor
fine
linen
he
answered
dekar
is
the
prince
of
all
the
herd
i
will
not
sell
nay
then
i
will
give
thee
gold
fifty
pieces
persisted
the
merchant
give
me
an
hundred
he
had
said
and
the
beast
is
thine
so
the
merchant
gave
him
an
hundred
pieces
of
gold
for
the
horse
which
was
truly
a
great
price
but
he
paid
it
without
murmuring
for
he
knew
that
he
could
again
sell
for
a
greater
to
the
king
of
egypt
of
the
gold
pieces
there
was
one
of
strange
device
and
this
ben
hesed
gave
to
his
that
she
might
hang
it
upon
her
necklace
the
maid
was
beautiful
to
look
upon
and
ben
hesed
felt
for
her
a
great
tenderness
which
was
a
thing
quite
by
itself
and
apart
from
the
pride
which
filled
his
breast
when
he
looked
upon
his
mighty
sons
the
name
of
this
maid
was
zarah
which
signifies
the
dawn
and
truly
she
was
fair
and
pure
as
the
first
beams
of
the
new
day
ere
yet
mortals
have
sullied
it
with
sin
it
came
to
pass
ben
hesed
saw
it
all
once
more
because
of
the
wonderful
amulet
which
he
held
in
his
hand
that
one
day
a
stranger
came
to
the
encampment
alone
he
was
sick
and
exhausted
because
of
the
hardness
of
his
journey
and
he
begged
of
ben
hesed
that
he
might
sojourn
for
a
space
with
his
tribe
till
he
should
recover
himself
and
ben
hesed
made
him
welcome
as
was
ever
his
custom
and
the
stranger
tarried
many
days
the
women
also
ministered
unto
him
for
he
was
both
comely
and
young
and
when
he
was
recovered
he
came
to
ben
hesed
and
said
to
him
behold
i
have
received
kindness
at
thy
hand
and
the
springs
of
life
are
again
strong
within
me
now
i
pray
thee
give
thy
servant
further
of
thy
bounty
for
there
is
yet
one
thing
that
i
would
ask
of
thee
and
ben
hesed
said
speak
my
son
for
my
hand
is
open
to
satisfy
the
utmost
wish
of
him
that
is
an
honored
guest
within
my
borders
then
the
young
man
bowed
himself
and
said
if
i
have
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
my
lord
give
to
me
thy
daughter
zarah
for
my
wife
for
i
love
her
with
my
soul
ben
hesed
looked
at
the
young
man
long
and
earnestly
and
his
heart
went
out
to
him
tell
me
he
said
all
of
thy
past
for
thou
hast
asked
of
me
the
most
precious
thing
that
i
possess
the
maiden
who
is
called
the
dawn
speak
freely
for
as
my
soul
liveth
if
thou
dost
keep
back
aught
that
i
should
know
thou
shalt
die
accursed
at
this
the
young
man
groaned
aloud
but
he
told
him
how
that
he
had
disputed
with
his
brother
over
the
inheritance
and
had
smitten
him
that
he
died
for
so
he
believed
at
the
time
and
when
ben
hesed
heard
all
he
rose
up
and
his
voice
was
cold
and
stern
go
he
said
that
i
see
thy
face
no
more
thinkest
thou
that
i
will
give
my
daughter
to
one
that
is
a
murderer
go
lest
i
fall
upon
thee
in
wrath
and
he
went
straightway
without
a
word
but
he
found
the
maiden
zarah
beside
the
fountain
and
he
told
her
all
that
had
passed
that
night
when
all
were
sleeping
the
two
rose
up
and
fled
away
from
the
encampment
and
were
seen
no
more
when
ben
hesed
found
that
they
were
gone
he
said
only
one
word
my
daughter
is
dead
and
from
that
time
no
one
durst
speak
to
him
of
the
matter
but
he
did
not
forget
though
long
years
were
passed
and
now
as
he
held
the
coin
of
strange
device
once
more
in
his
hand
he
knew
it
for
the
token
which
he
had
given
the
maiden
zarah
so
long
ago
and
as
he
looked
into
the
face
of
anat
he
saw
that
the
dawn
was
again
risen
then
he
called
the
two
and
he
told
them
all
the
story
and
when
he
had
finished
he
said
long
ago
hath
the
bitterness
passed
from
my
soul
but
there
hath
remained
ever
an
aching
wound
which
the
years
have
not
healed
god
hath
given
me
many
wonderful
mercies
but
none
more
wonderful
than
this
that
the
children
of
my
daughter
have
returned
to
her
father
s
house
then
they
fell
on
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
all
that
were
in
the
encampment
rejoiced
and
the
rejoicing
continued
many
days
afterward
by
the
word
of
messengers
which
ben
hesed
sent
to
jerusalem
they
learned
that
the
great
persecution
was
at
an
end
because
that
annas
was
now
dead
and
the
others
of
his
family
were
too
much
taken
up
with
disputing
over
the
inheritance
of
lands
and
houses
to
trouble
themselves
further
about
the
religious
beliefs
of
any
man
as
for
saul
of
tarsus
strange
tales
were
told
of
him
some
said
that
he
was
dead
others
that
he
was
blind
while
others
still
declared
that
he
had
been
rebuked
of
the
lord
in
a
vision
and
that
he
now
believed
but
this
tale
was
not
credited
of
many
let
us
return
to
jerusalem
said
mary
of
nazareth
for
i
would
fain
know
whether
my
son
john
be
safe
then
there
is
also
the
house
to
be
looked
to
so
they
went
back
to
jerusalem
for
a
space
ben
hesed
and
his
grandchildren
also
but
anna
and
her
husband
went
not
all
the
way
jerusalem
is
hateful
to
me
said
caiaphas
and
moreover
we
should
be
in
peril
of
our
lives
at
the
hand
of
our
kindred
we
will
go
away
into
galilee
for
i
would
fain
behold
all
the
places
where
the
lord
lived
and
taught
and
where
also
he
passed
his
childhood
so
the
two
parted
from
the
others
after
that
they
had
passed
the
wilderness
and
they
traveled
humbly
as
pilgrims
sojourning
long
in
all
the
places
where
jesus
had
been
in
his
and
this
did
they
for
many
years
till
that
caiaphas
was
grown
to
be
an
old
man
i
am
not
worthy
he
said
humbly
to
write
of
all
that
he
taught
and
suffered
that
should
be
writ
by
the
hand
of
one
that
loved
him
while
he
yet
lived
but
i
can
gather
up
the
tales
that
are
told
of
his
sinless
childhood
and
so
as
they
journeyed
he
made
inquiry
everywhere
concerning
the
child
jesus
insomuch
that
after
a
time
the
children
would
point
him
out
and
whisper
yonder
old
man
is
the
prophet
of
the
child
jesus
and
after
many
years
he
made
a
book
of
these
tales
and
it
was
called
the
gospel
of
the
infancy
he
took
great
pleasure
and
comfort
in
the
work
and
it
occupied
all
the
closing
years
of
his
life
one
thing
only
do
i
regret
he
said
to
his
wife
many
times
and
that
is
that
i
did
not
begin
this
work
while
the
mother
of
our
lord
yet
lived
for
she
could
have
told
me
whether
it
be
truly
set
forth
but
now
i
shall
never
know
thou
wilt
know
beloved
afterward
said
anna
her
eyes
shining
with
a
wise
and
tender
light
for
it
must
needs
be
that
angels
watched
with
awe
each
moment
of
that
be
sure
that
it
is
all
writ
in
heaven
