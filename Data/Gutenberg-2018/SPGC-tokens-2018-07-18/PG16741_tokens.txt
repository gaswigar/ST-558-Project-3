preface
a
writer
on
slavery
has
no
difficulty
in
tracing
back
its
origin
there
is
also
the
advantage
of
finding
it
with
its
continued
history
and
the
laws
given
by
god
to
govern
his
own
institution
in
the
holy
bible
neither
profane
history
tradition
nor
philosophical
research
are
required
to
prove
its
origin
or
existence
though
they
as
all
things
must
come
forward
to
substantiate
the
truth
of
the
scriptures
god
who
created
the
human
race
willed
they
should
be
holy
like
himself
sin
was
committed
and
the
curse
of
sin
death
was
induced
other
punishments
were
denounced
for
the
perpetration
of
particular
crimes
the
shedding
of
man
blood
for
murder
and
the
curse
of
slavery
the
mysterious
reasons
that
here
influenced
the
mind
of
the
creator
it
is
not
ours
to
declare
yet
may
we
learn
enough
from
his
revealed
word
on
this
and
every
other
subject
to
confirm
his
power
truth
and
justice
there
is
no
christian
duty
more
insisted
upon
in
scripture
than
reverence
and
obedience
to
parents
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
the
relation
of
child
to
parent
resembles
closely
that
of
man
to
his
creator
he
who
loves
and
honors
his
god
will
assuredly
love
and
honor
his
parents
though
it
is
evidently
the
duty
of
every
parent
so
to
live
as
to
secure
the
respect
and
affection
of
his
child
yet
there
is
nothing
in
the
scriptures
to
authorize
a
child
treating
with
disrespect
a
parent
though
he
be
unworthy
in
the
greatest
degree
the
human
mind
naturally
rebellious
requires
every
command
and
incentive
to
submission
the
first
of
the
ten
commandments
insisting
on
the
duty
owing
to
the
creator
and
the
fifth
on
that
belonging
to
our
parents
are
the
sources
of
all
order
and
good
arrangement
in
the
minor
relations
of
life
and
on
obedience
to
them
depends
the
comfort
of
society
reverence
to
age
and
especially
where
it
is
found
in
the
person
of
those
who
by
the
will
of
god
were
the
authors
of
their
being
is
insisted
upon
in
the
jewish
covenant
not
indeed
less
required
now
but
as
the
jews
were
called
from
among
the
heathen
nations
of
the
earth
to
be
the
peculiar
people
of
god
they
were
to
show
such
evidences
of
this
law
in
their
hearts
by
their
conduct
that
other
nations
might
look
on
and
say
ye
are
the
children
of
the
lord
your
god
it
was
after
an
act
of
a
child
dishonoring
an
aged
father
that
the
prophecy
entailing
slavery
as
a
curse
on
a
portion
of
the
human
race
was
uttered
nor
could
it
have
been
from
any
feeling
of
resentment
or
revenge
that
the
curse
was
made
known
by
the
lips
of
a
servant
of
god
for
this
servant
of
god
was
a
parent
and
with
what
sorrow
would
any
parent
yea
the
worst
of
parents
utter
a
malediction
which
insured
such
punishment
and
misery
on
a
portion
of
his
posterity
even
the
blessing
which
was
promised
to
his
other
children
could
not
have
consoled
him
for
the
sad
necessity
he
might
not
resist
the
spirit
of
god
though
with
perfect
submission
he
obeyed
its
dictates
yet
with
what
regret
the
heart
of
any
christian
parent
will
answer
this
appeal
we
may
well
imagine
some
of
the
reasons
for
the
will
of
god
in
thus
punishing
ham
and
his
descendants
prior
to
the
unfilial
act
which
is
recorded
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
he
had
been
a
righteous
man
had
he
been
one
after
god
own
heart
he
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
such
a
sin
what
must
that
child
be
who
would
openly
dishonor
and
expose
an
erring
parent
borne
down
with
the
weight
of
years
and
honored
by
god
as
noah
had
been
the
very
act
of
disrespect
to
noah
the
chosen
of
god
implies
wilful
contempt
of
god
himself
ham
was
not
a
young
man
either
he
had
not
the
excuse
of
the
impetuosity
of
youth
nor
its
thoughtlessness
he
was
himself
an
old
man
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
he
had
led
a
life
at
variance
with
god
laws
when
he
committed
so
gross
and
violent
a
sin
it
may
be
that
the
curse
of
god
which
had
lain
tranquil
long
was
roused
and
uttered
against
him
a
curse
not
conditional
not
implied
now
as
then
a
mandate
of
the
eternal
among
the
curses
threatened
by
the
levites
upon
mount
ebal
was
the
one
found
in
the
verse
of
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
cursed
be
he
that
setteth
light
by
his
father
or
his
mother
by
the
law
of
moses
this
sin
was
punished
with
death
of
the
son
which
will
not
obey
the
voice
of
his
father
or
the
voice
of
his
mother
all
the
men
of
his
city
shall
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
deut
xxi
god
in
his
wisdom
instituted
this
severe
law
in
early
times
and
it
must
convince
us
that
there
were
reasons
in
the
divine
mind
for
insisting
on
the
ordinance
exacting
the
most
perfect
submission
and
reverence
to
an
earthly
parent
when
after
the
deluge
says
josephus
the
earth
was
settled
in
its
former
condition
noah
set
about
its
cultivation
and
when
he
had
planted
it
with
vines
and
when
the
fruit
was
ripe
and
he
had
gathered
the
grapes
in
the
season
and
the
wine
was
ready
for
use
he
offered
a
sacrifice
and
feasted
and
being
inebriated
fell
asleep
and
lay
in
an
unseemly
manner
when
ham
saw
this
he
came
laughing
and
showed
him
to
his
brothers
does
not
this
exhibit
the
impression
of
the
jews
as
regards
the
character
of
ham
could
a
man
capable
of
such
an
act
deserve
the
blessing
of
a
just
and
holy
god
the
fact
of
noah
transgression
is
recorded
by
the
inspired
historian
with
that
perfect
impartiality
which
is
peculiar
to
the
scriptures
as
an
instance
and
evidence
of
human
frailty
and
imperfection
ham
appears
to
have
been
a
bad
man
and
probably
he
rejoiced
to
find
his
father
in
so
unbecoming
a
situation
that
by
exposing
him
he
might
retaliate
for
the
reproofs
which
he
had
received
from
his
parental
authority
and
perhaps
canaan
first
discovered
his
situation
and
told
it
to
ham
the
conduct
of
ham
in
exposing
his
father
to
his
brethren
and
their
behaviour
in
turning
away
from
the
sight
of
his
disgrace
form
a
striking
contrast
we
are
told
in
ix
and
ham
the
father
of
canaan
saw
the
nakedness
of
his
father
and
told
his
two
brethren
without
and
in
the
and
verses
we
read
and
noah
awoke
from
his
wine
and
knew
what
his
younger
son
had
done
unto
him
and
he
said
cursed
be
canaan
a
servant
of
servants
shall
he
be
unto
his
brethren
and
he
said
blessed
be
the
lord
god
of
shem
and
canaan
shall
be
his
servant
god
shall
enlarge
japheth
and
he
shall
dwell
in
the
tents
of
shem
and
canaan
shall
be
his
servant
is
it
not
preposterous
that
any
man
any
christian
should
read
these
verses
and
say
slavery
was
not
instituted
by
god
as
a
curse
on
ham
and
canaan
and
their
posterity
and
who
can
read
the
history
of
the
world
and
say
this
curse
has
not
existed
ever
since
it
was
uttered
the
whole
continent
of
africa
says
bishop
newton
was
peopled
principally
by
the
descendants
of
ham
and
for
how
many
ages
have
the
better
parts
of
that
country
lain
under
the
dominion
of
the
romans
then
of
the
saracens
and
now
of
the
turks
in
what
wickedness
ignorance
barbarity
slavery
misery
live
most
of
the
inhabitants
and
of
the
poor
negroes
how
many
hundreds
every
year
are
sold
and
bought
like
beasts
in
the
market
and
conveyed
from
one
quarter
of
the
world
to
do
the
work
of
beasts
in
another
but
does
this
curse
authorize
the
god
forbid
he
commanded
the
jews
to
enslave
the
heathen
around
them
saying
they
should
be
their
bondmen
forever
but
he
has
given
no
such
command
to
other
nations
the
threatenings
and
reproofs
uttered
against
israel
throughout
the
old
testament
on
the
subject
of
slavery
refer
to
their
oppressing
and
keeping
in
slavery
their
own
countrymen
never
is
there
the
slightest
imputation
of
sin
as
far
as
i
can
see
conveyed
against
them
for
holding
in
bondage
the
children
of
heathen
nations
yet
do
the
scriptures
evidently
permit
slavery
even
to
the
present
time
the
curse
on
the
serpent
and
the
lord
god
said
unto
the
serpent
because
thou
hast
done
this
thou
art
cursed
above
all
cattle
and
above
every
beast
of
the
field
uttered
more
than
sixteen
hundred
years
before
the
curse
of
noah
upon
ham
and
his
race
has
lost
nothing
of
its
force
and
true
meaning
cursed
is
the
ground
for
thy
sake
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life
said
the
supreme
being
has
this
curse
failed
or
been
removed
remember
the
threatened
curses
of
god
upon
the
whole
jewish
tribe
if
they
forsook
his
worship
have
not
they
been
fulfilled
however
inexplicable
may
be
the
fact
that
god
would
appoint
the
curse
of
continual
servitude
on
a
portion
of
his
creatures
will
any
one
with
the
bible
open
in
his
hands
to
say
the
fact
does
not
exist
it
is
not
ours
to
decide
the
supreme
being
acts
we
may
observe
his
dealings
with
man
but
we
may
not
ask
until
he
reveals
it
why
hast
thou
thus
done
cursed
is
every
one
who
loves
not
the
lord
jesus
christ
are
not
all
these
curses
recorded
and
will
they
not
all
be
fulfilled
god
has
permitted
slavery
to
exist
in
every
age
and
in
almost
every
nation
of
the
earth
it
was
only
commanded
to
the
jews
and
it
was
with
them
restricted
to
the
heathen
referring
entirely
to
the
race
of
ham
who
had
been
judicially
condemned
to
a
condition
of
servitude
more
than
eighteen
hundred
years
before
the
giving
of
the
law
by
the
mouth
of
noah
the
medium
of
the
holy
ghost
no
others
at
least
were
to
be
enslaved
forever
every
book
of
the
old
testament
records
a
history
in
which
slaves
and
god
laws
concerning
them
are
spoken
of
while
as
far
as
profane
history
goes
back
we
can
not
fail
to
see
proofs
of
the
existence
of
slavery
no
legislator
of
history
says
voltaire
attempted
to
abrogate
slavery
society
was
so
accustomed
to
this
degradation
of
the
species
that
epictetus
who
was
assuredly
worth
more
than
his
master
never
expresses
any
surprise
at
his
being
a
slave
egypt
sparta
athens
carthage
and
rome
had
their
thousands
of
slaves
in
the
bible
the
best
and
chosen
servants
of
god
owned
slaves
while
in
profane
history
the
purest
and
greatest
men
did
the
same
in
the
very
nation
over
whose
devoted
head
hung
the
curse
of
god
slavery
vindictive
lawless
and
cruel
slavery
has
prevailed
it
is
said
no
nation
of
the
earth
has
equalled
the
jewish
in
the
enslaving
of
negroes
except
the
negroes
themselves
and
examination
will
prove
that
the
descendants
of
ham
and
canaan
have
as
god
foresaw
justified
by
their
conduct
the
doom
which
he
pronounced
against
them
but
it
has
been
contended
that
the
people
of
god
sinned
in
holding
their
in
bondage
open
your
bible
christian
and
read
the
commands
of
god
as
regards
slavery
the
laws
that
he
made
to
govern
the
conduct
of
the
master
and
the
slave
but
again
live
under
the
glorious
and
new
dispensation
of
christ
and
he
came
to
establish
god
will
and
to
confirm
such
laws
as
were
to
continue
in
existence
to
destroy
such
rules
as
were
not
to
govern
our
lives
when
there
was
but
one
family
upon
the
earth
a
portion
of
the
family
was
devoted
to
be
slaves
to
others
god
made
a
covenant
with
abraham
he
included
in
it
his
slaves
he
that
is
born
in
thy
house
and
he
that
is
bought
with
thy
money
are
the
words
of
scripture
a
servant
of
abraham
says
and
the
lord
has
blessed
my
master
greatly
and
he
is
become
great
and
he
hath
given
him
flocks
and
herds
and
silver
and
gold
and
and
and
camels
and
asses
the
lord
has
called
himself
the
god
of
abraham
and
isaac
and
jacob
these
holy
men
were
slaveholders
the
existence
of
slavery
then
and
the
sanction
of
god
on
his
own
institution
is
palpable
from
the
time
of
the
pronouncing
of
the
curse
until
the
glorious
advent
of
the
son
of
god
when
he
came
slavery
existed
in
every
part
of
the
world
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
came
from
heaven
and
dwelt
upon
the
earth
his
mission
to
proclaim
the
will
of
god
to
a
world
sunk
in
the
lowest
depths
of
iniquity
even
the
dear
and
chosen
people
of
god
had
departed
from
him
had
forsaken
his
worship
and
turned
aside
from
his
commands
he
was
born
of
a
virgin
he
was
called
emmanuel
he
was
god
with
us
wise
men
traveled
from
afar
to
behold
the
they
knelt
before
him
they
opened
their
treasures
they
presented
to
them
gifts
angels
of
god
descended
in
dreams
to
ensure
the
protection
of
his
life
against
the
king
who
sought
it
he
emerged
from
infancy
and
grew
in
favour
with
god
and
man
he
was
tempted
but
not
overcome
angels
came
again
from
heaven
to
minister
to
him
he
fulfilled
every
jot
and
tittle
of
the
law
and
entered
upon
the
duties
for
which
he
left
the
glories
of
heaven
that
mission
was
fulfilled
the
people
which
sat
in
darkness
saw
great
light
and
to
them
which
sat
in
the
region
and
shadow
of
death
light
is
sprung
up
look
at
his
miracles
the
cleansing
of
the
leper
the
healing
of
the
sick
the
casting
out
unclean
spirits
the
raising
of
the
dead
the
rebuking
of
the
winds
and
seas
the
control
of
those
possessed
with
devils
and
say
was
he
not
the
son
of
god
yea
was
he
not
god
full
of
power
and
goodness
he
came
into
the
world
and
light
and
glory
followed
every
footstep
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
glance
of
his
eye
the
very
touch
of
the
garment
in
which
his
assumed
mortality
was
arrayed
was
a
medicine
mighty
to
save
he
came
on
an
errand
of
mercy
to
the
world
and
he
was
all
powerful
to
accomplish
the
divine
intent
but
did
he
emancipate
the
slave
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
was
the
object
of
his
coming
and
is
it
possible
that
the
large
portion
of
them
then
slaves
could
have
escaped
his
eye
did
he
condemn
the
institution
which
he
had
made
did
he
establish
universal
freedom
oh
no
he
came
to
redeem
the
world
from
the
power
of
sin
his
was
no
earthly
mission
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
organization
of
society
he
healed
the
sick
servant
of
the
centurion
but
he
did
not
command
his
freedom
nor
is
there
a
word
that
fell
from
his
sacred
lips
that
could
be
construed
into
a
condemnation
of
that
institution
which
had
existed
from
the
early
ages
of
the
world
existed
then
and
is
continued
now
the
application
made
by
the
abolitionist
of
the
golden
rule
is
absurd
it
might
then
apply
to
the
child
who
his
father
no
longer
control
him
to
the
apprentice
who
no
longer
that
the
man
to
whom
he
is
bound
should
have
a
right
to
direct
him
thus
the
foundations
of
society
would
be
shaken
nay
destroyed
christ
would
have
us
deal
with
others
not
as
they
desire
but
as
the
law
of
god
demands
in
the
condition
of
life
in
which
we
have
been
placed
we
must
do
what
we
conscientiously
believe
to
be
our
duty
to
our
christ
alludes
to
slavery
but
does
not
forbid
it
and
the
servant
abideth
not
in
the
house
forever
but
the
son
abideth
ever
if
the
son
therefore
shall
make
you
free
you
are
free
indeed
in
these
two
verses
of
the
gospel
of
john
there
is
a
manifest
allusion
to
the
fact
and
condition
of
slaves
of
this
fact
the
saviour
took
occasion
to
illustrate
by
way
of
similitude
the
condition
of
a
wicked
man
who
is
the
slave
of
sin
and
to
show
that
as
a
son
who
was
the
heir
in
a
house
set
a
bondman
free
if
that
son
were
of
the
proper
age
so
he
the
son
of
god
could
set
the
enslaved
soul
free
from
sin
when
he
would
be
free
indeed
show
me
in
the
history
of
the
old
testament
or
in
the
life
of
christ
authority
to
proclaim
a
the
holding
of
the
race
of
ham
and
canaan
in
bondage
in
the
times
of
the
apostles
what
do
we
see
slaves
are
still
in
bondage
the
children
of
ham
are
menials
as
they
were
before
christ
had
come
had
died
had
ascended
to
heaven
and
slavery
still
existed
had
the
apostles
authority
to
do
it
away
had
christ
left
it
to
them
to
carry
out
in
this
instance
his
revealed
will
art
thou
said
paul
called
being
a
slave
care
not
for
it
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
free
use
it
rather
let
every
man
abide
in
the
same
calling
wherein
he
is
called
let
as
many
servants
as
are
under
the
yoke
count
their
own
masters
worthy
of
all
honor
that
the
name
of
god
and
his
doctrines
be
not
blasphemed
and
they
that
have
believing
masters
let
them
not
despise
them
because
they
are
brethren
but
rather
do
them
service
because
they
are
faithful
and
beloved
partakers
of
the
benefit
it
is
well
known
and
often
quoted
that
the
holy
apostle
did
all
he
could
to
restore
a
slave
to
his
master
one
whom
he
had
been
the
means
of
making
free
in
a
spiritual
sense
yet
he
knew
that
god
had
made
onesimus
a
slave
and
when
he
had
fled
from
his
master
paul
persuaded
him
to
return
and
to
do
his
duty
toward
him
open
your
bible
christian
and
carefully
read
the
letter
of
paul
to
philemon
and
contrast
its
spirit
with
the
incendiary
publications
of
the
abolitionists
of
the
present
day
paul
was
not
a
fanatic
and
therefore
not
an
abolitionist
the
christian
age
advanced
and
slavery
continued
and
we
approach
the
time
when
our
fathers
fled
from
persecution
to
the
soil
we
now
call
our
own
when
they
fought
for
the
liberty
to
which
they
felt
they
had
a
right
our
fathers
fought
for
it
and
our
mothers
did
more
when
they
urged
forth
their
husbands
and
sons
not
knowing
whether
the
that
was
glowing
with
religion
and
patriotism
would
not
soon
be
dyeing
the
land
that
had
been
their
refuge
and
where
they
fondly
hoped
they
should
find
a
happy
home
oh
glorious
parentage
children

no
farther
back

not

the
gemmed
coronet
thy
brow
stop
here
it
is
enough
that
they
earned
for
thee
a
home
a
free
a
happy
home
and
what
did
they
say
to
the
slavery
that
existed
then
and
had
been
entailed
upon
them
by
the
english
government
their
opinions
are
preserved
among
us
they
were
dictated
by
their
position
and
necessities
and
they
were
wisely
formed
in
the
north
slavery
was
useless
nay
more
it
was
a
drawback
to
the
prosperity
of
that
section
of
the
union
it
was
dispensed
with
in
other
sections
gradually
our
people
have
seen
their
condition
would
be
more
prosperous
without
slaves
they
have
emancipated
them
in
the
south
they
are
necessary
though
an
evil
it
is
one
that
can
not
be
dispensed
with
and
here
they
have
been
retained
and
will
be
retained
unless
god
should
manifest
his
will
which
never
yet
has
been
done
to
the
contrary
knowing
that
the
people
of
the
south
still
have
the
views
of
their
revolutionary
forefathers
we
see
plainly
that
many
of
the
north
have
rejected
the
opinions
of
theirs
slaves
were
at
the
north
and
south
considered
and
recognized
as
property
as
they
are
in
scripture
the
whole
nation
sanctioned
slavery
by
adopting
the
constitution
which
provides
for
them
and
for
their
restoration
when
fugitive
to
their
owners
our
country
was
then
like
one
family
their
souls
had
been
tried
and
made
pure
by
a
united
struggle
they
loved
as
brothers
who
had
suffered
together
would
it
were
so
at
the
present
day
the
subject
of
slavery
was
agitated
among
them
many
difficulties
occurred
but
they
were
all
settled
and
they
thought
effectually
they
agreed
then
on
the
propriety
of
giving
up
runaway
slaves
unanimously
sherman
of
connecticut
saw
no
more
impropriety
in
the
public
seizing
and
surrendering
a
slave
or

the

of

to
do
her
bidding
she
trafficked
in
the
flesh
and

of
her
but
our
immortal
fathers
put
an
end
to
the
disgraceful
trade
they
saw
its
heinous
sin
for
they
had
no
command
to
enslave
the
heathen
but
they
had
no
command
to
emancipate
the

therefore
they
wisely
forbore
farther
to
interfere
they
drew
the
nice
line
of
distinction
between
an
unavoidable
evil
and
a
sin
slavery
was
acknowledged
and
slaves
considered
as
property
all
over

well
as

there
been
any
law
reversing
this
except
in
the
states
that
have
become

limits
of

states
slaves

the

came
to

refused
not

when
the

of

citizens
shed
by
a
british
soldiery
had
stained
our

and
flowed
upon
the

that
surround

sunk

came
with

in

our

the

it

turning
aside
the

treading
under

the

despising
the

of

the

and
the
want

in

would
give
an
unfavorable
first
impression
the
old
episcopal
church
standing
at
the
entrance
of

could
not
fail
to
be

from

a

stopped
his

in
passing
by

wonder
at

look

some
it
may
be
to
wish
they
were
sleeping
in
the
shades
of
its

walls
the
slight
eminence
on
which
the

commanded
a
view
of
the
residences
of
several
gentlemen
of
fortune
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
to
the
nearest
one
a
gentleman
on
horseback
was
directing
his
way
the
horse
required
no
direction
in

for
so
accustomed
was
he
to
the
ride
to
exeter
and
to
the
good
fare
he
enjoyed
on
arriving
there
that
neither
whip
nor
spur
was
necessary
he
traced
the
familiar
road
with
evident
pleasure
the
house
at
exeter
was
irregularly
built
but
the
white
stone
wings
and
the
over
the
main
building
gave
an
appearance
of
taste
to
the
mansion
the
fine
old
trees
intercepted
the
view
though
adding
greatly
to
its
beauty
the
porter
lodge
and
the
wide
lawn
entered
by
its
open
gates
the
gardens
at
either
side
of

the
neatness
and

of
the
all
showed
a
prosperous
state
of
affairs
with
the
owner
soon
the
large
porch
with
its
green
blinds
and
the
sweetbrier
entwining
them
came
in
view
and
the
family
party
that
occupied
it
were
discernible
before
barbour
had
reached
the
point
for
alighting
from

a
servant
stood
in
readiness
to
take

from

among
the
roses
with
her
usual
sweet
words
of
welcome
weston
the
owner
of

its
adjoining

arose
with
a

cordial
greeting

united
with
him
in
his
kind
reception
of
a
valued
guest
and

weston
was
a
widower
with
an
only
son
the
young
gentleman
was
at
this
time
at
yale
college
he
had
been
absent
for
three
years
and
so
anxious
was
he
to
graduate
with
honor
that
he
had
chosen
not
to
return
to
virginia
until
his
course
of
study
should
be
completed
the
family
had
visited
him
during
the
first
year
of
his
exile
as
he
called
it
but
it
had
now
been
two
years
since
he
had
seen
any
member
of
it
there
was
an
engagement
between
him
and
his
cousin
though
alice
was
but
fifteen
when
it
was
formed
they
had
been
associated
from
the
earliest
period
of
their
lives
and
arthur
declared
that
should
he
return
home
on
a
visit
he
would
not
be
able
to
break
away
from
its
happiness
to
the
routine
of
a
college
life
he
yielded
therefore
to
the
earnest
entreaties
of
his
father
to
remain
at
new
haven
until
he
graduated
weston
will
stand
for
a
specimen
of
the
southern
gentleman
of
the
old
school
the
bland
and
cheerful
expression
of
his
countenance
the
arrangement
of
his
soft
fine
hair
the
fineness
of
the
texture
and
the
perfect
cleanliness
of
every
part
of
his
dress
the
plaiting
of
his
shirt
ruffles
the
whiteness
of
his
hand
and
the
sound
of
his
clear
voice
in
fact
every
item
of
his
appearance
won
the
good
opinion
of
a
stranger
while
the
feelings
of
his
heart
and
his
steady
course
of
christian
life
made
him
honored
and
reverenced
as
he
deserved
he
possessed
that
requisite
to
the
character
of
a
true
gentleman
a
kind
and
charitable
heart
none
of
the
present
members
of
his
family
had
any
lawful
claim
upon
him
yet
he
cherished
them
with
the
utmost
affection
he
requested
his
widow
on
the
death
of
his
own
wife
to
assume
the
charge
of
his
house
and
she
was
in
every
respect
its
mistress
alice
was
necessary
to
his
happiness
almost
to
his
existence
she
was
the
very
rose
in
his
garden
of
life
he
had
never
had
a
sister
and
he
regarded
alice
as
a
legacy
from
his
only
brother
to
whom
he
had
been
most
tenderly
attached
had
she
been
uninteresting
she
would
still
have
been
very
dear
to
him
but
her
beauty
and
her
many
graces
of
appearance
and
character
drew
closely
together
the
bonds
of
love
between
them
alice
returning
with
the
utmost
warmth
her
uncle
affection
weston
was
unlike
her
daughter
in
appearance
alice
resembling
her
father
family
her
dark
fine
eyes
were
still
full
of
the
fire
that
had
beamed
from
them
in
youth
there
were
lines
about
her
mouth
and
her
face
when
in
repose
bore
traces
of
the
warfare
of
past
years
the
heart
has
a
writing
of
its
own
and
we
can
see
it
on
the
countenance
time
has
no
power
to
obliterate
it
but
generally
deepens
the
expression
there
was
at
times
too
a
sternness
in
her
voice
and
manner
yet
it
left
no
unpleasant
impression
her
general
refinement
and
her
fine
sense
and
education
made
her
society
always
desirable
cousin
janet
as
she
was
called
by
them
all
was
a
dependant
and
distant
relation
a
friend
faithful
and
unfailing
a
bright
example
of
all
that
is
holy
and
good
in
the
christian
character
she
assisted
weston
greatly
in
the
many
cares
that
devolved
on
the
mistress
of
a
plantation
especially
in
instructing
the
young
female
servants
in
knitting
and
sewing
and
in
such
household
duties
as
would
make
them
useful
in
that
state
of
life
in
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
place
them
her
heart
was
full
of
love
to
all
god
creatures
the
servants
came
to
her
with
their
little
ailings
and
grievances
and
she
had
always
a
soothing
remedy
some
little
specific
for
a
bodily
sickness
with
a
word
of
advice
and
kindness
and
if
the
case
required
it
of
gentle
reproof
for
complaints
of
another
nature
cousin
janet
was
an
old
maid
yet
many
an
orphan
and
friendless
child
had
shed
tears
upon
her
bosom
some
whose
hands
she
had
folded
together
in
prayer
as
they
knelt
beside
her
learning
from
her
lips
a
child
simple
petition
had
long
ago
laid
down
to
sleep
for
ever
some
are
living
still
surrounded
by
the
halo
of
their
good
influence
there
was
one
of
whom
we
shall
speak
who
was
to
her
a
source
of
great
anxiety
and
the
constant
subject
of
her
thoughts
and
fervent
prayers
many
years
had
gone
by
since
she
had
accepted
weston
earnest
entreaty
to
make
exeter
her
home
and
although
the
bread
she
eat
was
that
of
charity
yet
she
brought
a
blessing
upon
the
house
that
sheltered
her
by
her
presence
she
was
one
of
the
chosen
ones
of
the
lord
even
in
this
day
it
is
possible
to
entertain
an
angel
unawares
she
is
before
you
reader
in
all
the
dignity
of
old
age
of
a
long
life
drawing
to
a
close
still
to
the
last
she
works
while
it
is
yet
day
with
her
dress
and
her
muslin
handkerchief
pinned
precisely
at
the
waist
and
over
her
bosom
with
her
eyes
sunken
and
dim
but
expressive
with
the
wrinkles
so
many
and
so
deep
and
the
thin
white
folds
of
her
hair
parted
under
her
cap
with
her
silver
attached
to
her
side
and
her
needles
in
ever
busy
hands
cousin
janet
would
perhaps
first
arrest
the
attention
of
a
stranger
in
spite
of
the
glowing
cheek
and
golden
curls
that
were
contrasting
with
her
it
was
the
beauty
of
old
age
and
youth
side
by
side
alice
face
in
its
full
perfection
did
not
mar
the
loveliness
of
hers
the
violet
eyes
of
the
one
with
their
long
sweep
of
eyelash
could
not
eclipse
the
mild
but
deep
expression
of
the
other
the
rich
burden
of
glossy
hair
was
lovely
but
so
were
the
white
locks
and
the
slight
but
rounded
form
was
only
compared
in
its
youthful
grace
to
the
almost
shadowy
dignity
of
old
age
it
was
just
sundown
but
the
servants
were
all
at
home
after
their
work
and
they
too
were
enjoying
the
pleasant
evening
time
some
were
seated
at
the
door
of
their
cabins
others
lounging
on
the
grass
all
at
ease
and
without
care
many
of
their
comfortable
cabins
had
been
recently
whitewashed
and
were
adorned
with
little
gardens
in
front
over
the
one
nearest
the
house
a
multiflora
rose
was
creeping
in
full
bloom
singularly
musical
voices
were
heard
at
intervals
singing
snatches
of
songs
of
a
style
in
which
the
servants
of
the
south
especially
delight
and
not
unfrequently
as
the
full
chorus
was
shouted
by
a
number
their
still
more
peculiar
laugh
was
heard
above
it
all
barbour
had
recently
returned
from
a
pleasure
tour
in
our
northern
states
had
been
absent
for
two
months
and
felt
that
he
had
not
in
as
long
a
time
witnessed
such
a
scene
of
real
enjoyment
he
thought
it
would
have
softened
the
heart
of
the
sternest
hater
of
southern
institutions
to
have
been
a
spectator
here
it
might
possibly
have
inclined
him
to
think
the
sun
of
his
beneficence
shines
over
every
part
of
our
favored
land
take
a
seat
my
dear
sir
weston
said
in
our
sweetbrier
house
as
alice
calls
it
the
evening
would
lose
half
its
beauty
to
us
if
we
were
within
alice
is
always
right
said
barbour
in
every
thing
she
says
and
does
and
so
i
will
occupy
this
that
i
know
she
placed
here
for
me
dear
me
what
a
glorious
evening
those
distant
peaks
of
the
blue
ridge
look
bluer
than
i
ever
saw
them
before
ah
you
are
glad
to
tread
virginia
soil
once
more
that
is
evident
enough
said
weston
there
is
no
danger
of
your
getting
tired
of
your
native
state
again
who
says
i
was
ever
tired
of
her
i
challenge
you
to
prove
your
insinuation
i
wanted
to
see
this
great
new
england
the
norrurd
as
bacchus
calls
it
and
i
have
seen
it
i
have
enjoyed
seeing
it
too
and
now
i
am
glad
to
be
at
home
again
here
comes
uncle
bacchus
now
barbour
said
alice
do
look
at
him
walk
is
he
not
a
curiosity
he
has
as
much
pretension
in
his
manner
as
if
he
were
really
doing
us
a
favor
in
paying
us
a
visit
the
old
scamp
said
barbour
he
has
a
frolic
in
view
he
wants
to
go
off
either
to
a
campmeeting
or
a
barbecue
he
looks
as
if
he
were
hooked
together
and
could
be
taken
apart
limb
by
limb
bacchus
had
commenced
bowing
some
time
before
he
reached
the
piazza
but
on
ascending
the
steps
he
made
a
particularly
low
bow
to
his
master
and
then
in
the
same
manner
though
with
much
less
reverence
paid
his
respects
to
the
others
well
bacchus
said
weston
how
is
yer
health
dis
evenin
master
you
aint
been
so
well
latterly
we
soon
have
green
corn
though
and
that
helps
dispepsy
wonderful
it
may
be
good
for
dyspepsia
bacchus
said
weston
but
it
sometimes
gives
old
people
cholera
morbus
when
they
eat
it
raw
so
i
advise
you
to
remember
last
year
experience
and
roast
it
before
you
eat
it
i
shall
indeed
replied
bacchus
was
an
awful
time
i
had
last
summer
my
blessed
grief
but
i
thought
my
time
was
done
come
but
de
lord
was
mighty
good
to
me
he
brought
me
up
again
miss
janet
physic
done
me
more
good
though
than
any
thing
only
it
put
me
to
sleep
and
i
never
slept
so
much
in
my
born
days
you
were
always
something
of
a
sleeper
i
am
told
bacchus
said
cousin
janet
though
i
have
no
doubt
the
laudanum
had
that
effect
you
must
be
more
prudent
old
people
can
not
take
such
liberties
with
themselves
lor
miss
janet
i
aint
so
mighty
ole

so
she
clumb
a
great
tree
and
sat
in
de
branches
and
watched
him
he
made
straight
for
de

and
he
kicked
up
de
sand
wid
his
hoofs
as

low
and
last
he

he

aunt
peggy
she
waded

when

bacchus
said
barbour
if

master
said
he
addressing
weston
but
at
the
same
time
giving
an
imploring
look
to
barbour
to
me
to
go
way
and
wait
at
de
barbecue
semmes
he

i
am
afraid
to
give
you
permission
said
weston
this
habit
of
drinking
that
is
growing
upon
you
is
a
disgrace
to
your
old
age
you
remember
you
were
picked
up
and
brought
home
in
a
cart
from
campmeeting
this
summer
and
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
so
soon
ask
a
favor
of
me
i
feels
mighty
shamed
o
that
sir
said
bacchus
but
i
hope
you
will
it
niggers
aint
like
white
people
no
how
they
ca
temptation
i
repented
wid
tears
for
dat
business
and
happen
agin
if
it
please
the
lord
not
to
lead
me
into
temptation
you
led
yourself
into
temptation
said
weston
you
took
pains
to
cross
two
or
three
fences
and
to
go
round
by
norris
tavern
when
if
you
had
chosen
you
could
have
come
home
by
the
other
road
true
as
gospel
said
bacchus
i
do
deny
de
furst
word
of
it
the
lord
forgive
me
for

that
little
misfortune
of
mine
it
sha

it
a
misfortune
do
you
bacchus
said
barbour
why
it
seems
to
me
such
a
great
christian
as

right
name
to
it
and
called
it
a

alice
laughing
i

bacchus
said
weston
who
felt
anxious
to
enjoy
the
society
of
his
friend
good
evenin
to
you
all
said
bacchus
retreating
with
many
bows
we
will
see
how
bacchus
kept
his
word
and
for
the
present
leave
weston
to
discuss
the
subjects
of
the
day
with
his
guest
while
the
ladies
paid
a
visit
to
aunt
peggy
and
listened
to
her
complaints
of
the
flies
and
the
little
niggers
and
the
thousand
and
one
ailings
that
belong
to
the
age
of
ninety
years
chapter
ii
you
rode
too
far
this
afternoon
alice
you
seem
to
be
very
tired
said
weston
no
dear
uncle
i
am
not
fatigued
the
wind
was
cold
and
it
makes
me
feel
stupid
why
did
not
walter
come
in
asked
weston
i
saw
him
returning
with
you
by
the
old
road
he
said
he
had
an
engagement
this
evening
replied
alice
as
she
raised
her
head
from
her
uncle
shoulder
poor
walter
said
cousin
janet
with
the
education
and
habits
of
a
gentleman
he
is
to
be
pitied
that
it
is
only
as
a
favor
he
is
received
among
those
with
whom
he
may
justly
consider
himself
on
an
equality
but
is
not
walter
our
equal
asked
alice
cousin
janet
held
her
knitting
close
to
her
eyes
to
look
for
a
dropped
stitch
while
weston
replied
for
her
my
love
you
know
probably
that
walter
is
not
an
equal
by
right
of
birth
to
those
whose
parents
held
a
fair
and
honorable
position
in
society
his
father
a
man
of
rare
talents
of
fascinating
appearance
and
winning
address
was
the
ruin
of
all
connected
with
him
even
his
mother
by
his
career
of
extravagance
and
dissipation
found
rest
in
the
termination
of
a
life
that
had
known
no
rest
his
first
wife
not
walter
mother
a
most
interesting
woman
was
divorced
from
him
by
an
unjust
decision
of
the
law
for
after
her
death
circumstances
transpired
that
clearly
proved
her
innocence
walter
mother
was
not
married
as
far
as
is
known
though
some
believe
she
was
and
that
she
concealed
it
in
consequence
of
the
wishes
and
threats
of
lee
who
was
ashamed
to
own
the
daughter
of
a
tradesman
for
his
wife
but
all
this
is
not
walter
fault
uncle
said
alice
assuredly
not
but
there
is
something
due
to
our
long
established
opinions
walter
should
go
to
a
new
country
where
these
things
are
not
known
and
where
his
education
and
talents
would
advance
him
here
they
are
too
fresh
in
the
memory
of
many
yet
do
i
feel
most
kindly
towards
him
though
he
rather
repels
the
interest
we
take
in
him
by
his
haughty
coldness
of
manner
the
attachment
between
him
and
my
son
from
their
infancy
draws
me
towards
him
arthur
writes
though
that
his
letters
are
very
reserved
and
not
frequent
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
there
was
always
a
want
of
candor
and
generosity
in
walter
disposition
remarked
alice
mother
you
never
liked
him
anna
said
weston
why
was
it
arthur
and
walter
contrast
so
strongly
answered
weston
arthur
was
always
perfectly
honest
and
even
as
a
little
child
though
quiet
in
his
way
of
showing
it
he
is
so
affectionate
in
his
disposition
walter
is
passionate
and
fickle
condescending
to
those
he
loves
but
treating
with
a
proud
indifference
every
one
else
i
wonder
he
does
not
go
abroad
he
has
the
command
of
his
fortune
now
and
here
he
can
never
be
happily
situated
no
woman
of
delicacy
would
ever
think
of
marrying
him
with
that
stain
on
his
birth
how
beautiful
his
mother
was
cousin
janet
said
weston
i
have
never
seen
more
grace
and
refinement
i
often
look
at
walter
and
recall
her
with
her
beautiful
brown
hair
and
blue
eyes
how
short
her
course
was
too
i
think
she
died
at
eighteen
do
tell
me
about
her
uncle
said
alice
cousin
janet
can
better
than
i
my
darling
have
you
never
told
alice
her
history
cousin
no
it
is
almost
too
sad
a
tale
for
alice
ear
and
there
is
something
holy
in
my
mind
in
the
recollection
of
the
sorrows
of
that
young
person
i
believe
she
was
a
wife
though
an
unacknowledged
one
if
the
grave
would
give
up
its
secrets
but
it
will
it
will
the
time
will
come
for
justice
to
all
even
to
poor
ellen
haywood
that
young
creature
was
worse
than
an
orphan
for
her
father
thriving
in
business
at
one
time
became
dissipated
and
reckless
ellen
time
was
her
own
and
after
her
mother
death
her
will
was
uncontrolled
her
education
was
not
good
enough
to
give
her
a
taste
for
she
had
a
fine
mind
though
and
the
strictest
sense
of
propriety
and
dignity
her
remarkable
beauty
drew
towards
her
the
attention
of
the
young
men
of
her
own
class
as
well
as
those
of
good
family
but
she
was
always
prudent
poor
girl
knowing
she
was
motherless
and
friendless
i
tried
to
win
her
regard
i
asked
her
to
come
to
the
house
with
some
other
young
girls
of
the
neighborhood
to
study
the
bible
under
my
poor
teachings
but
she
declined
and
i
afterwards
went
to
see
her
hoping
to
persuade
her
to
come
i
found
her
pale
and
delicate
and
much
dispirited
thanking
me
most
earnestly
she
begged
me
to
excuse
her
saying
she
rarely
went
out
on
account
of
her
father
habits
fearing
something
might
occur
during
her
absence
from
home
i
was
surprised
to
find
her
so
depressed
yet
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
any
thing
like
guilt
in
all
the
interviews
with
her
from
that
hour
until
her
death
ellen
father
died
but
not
before
many
had
spoken
lightly
of
his
daughter
lee
was
constantly
at
the
house
and
what
but
ellen
beauty
could
take
him
there
no
one
was
without
a
prejudice
against
lee
and
i
have
often
wondered
that
ellen
could
have
overlooked
what
every
one
knew
the
treatment
his
wife
had
received
you
will
think
continued
cousin
janet
that
it
is
because
i
am
an
old
maid
and
am
full
of
notions
that
i
can
not
imagine
how
a
woman
can
love
a
man
who
has
been
divorced
from
his
wife
i
who
have
never
loved
as
the
novelists
say
have
the
most
exalted
ideas
of
marriage
it
is
in
scripture
the
type
of
christ
love
to
the
church
life
is
so
full
of
cares
there
is
something
holy
in
the
thought
of
one
heart
being
privileged
to
rest
its
burden
on
another
but
how
can
that
man
be
loved
who
has
put
away
his
wife
from
him
because
he
is
tired
of
her
for
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
usual
excuses
incompatibility
of
temper
and
the
like
yet
ellen
did
love
him
with
a
love
passing
description
she
forgot
his
faults
and
her
own
position
she
loved
as
i
would
never
again
wish
to
see
a
friend
of
mine
love
any
creature
of
the
earth
time
passed
and
ellen
was
despised
lee
left
abruptly
for
europe
and
i
heard
that
this
poor
young
woman
was
about
to
become
a
mother
i
knew
she
was
alone
in
the
world
and
i
knew
my
duty
too
i
went
to
her
and
i
thank
him
who
inclined
me
to
seek
this
wandering
lamb
of
his
fold
and
to
be
it
may
be
the
means
of
leading
her
back
to
his
loving
care
and
protection
i
often
saw
her
during
the
last
few
weeks
of
her
life
and
she
was
usually
alone
aunt
lucy
her
mother
servant
and
her
own
nurse
when
an
infant
being
the
only
other
occupant
of
her
small
cottage
speaking
of
her
brings
back
vividly
as
if
it
happened
yesterday
the
scene
with
which
her
young
life
closed
lucy
sent
for
me
as
i
had
charged
her
but
the
messenger
delayed
and
in
consequence
ellen
had
been
some
hours
sick
when
i
arrived
oh
how
lovely
her
face
appears
to
my
memory
as
i
recall
her
she
was
in
no
pain
at
the
moment
i
entered
her
head
was
supported
by
pillows
and
her
brown
hair
fell
over
them
and
over
her
neck
her
eyes
were
bright
as
an
angel
her
cheeks
flushed
to
a
crimson
color
and
her
white
beautiful
hand
grasped
a
cane
which
lawton
had
just
placed
there
hoping
to
relieve
some
of
her
symptoms
by
bleeding
lucy
stood
by
full
of
anxiety
and
affection
for
this
faithful
servant
loved
her
as
she
loved
her
own
life
my
heart
reproached
me
for
my
unintentional
neglect
but
i
was
in
a
moment
by
her
side
supporting
her
head
upon
my
breast
it
is
like
a
dream
that
long
night
of
agony
the
patience
of
ellen
the
kindness
of
her
physician
and
the
devotion
of
her
old
nurse
i
thought
that
only
a
wife
could
have
endured
as
she
did
before
this
ellen
had
told
me
her
wishes
as
regards
her
child
persuaded
that
if
it
should
live
she
should
not
survive
its
birth
to
take
care
of
it
she
entreated
me
to
befriend
it
in
the
helpless
time
of
infancy
and
then
to
appeal
to
its
father
in
its
behalf
i
promised
her
to
do
so
always
chiding
her
for
not
hoping
and
trusting
i
would
say
is
a
blessing
as
long
as
god
gives
it
and
it
is
our
duty
to
consider
it
so
miss
janet
but
if
god
give
me
a
better
life
shall
i
not
esteem
it
a
greater
blessing
i
have
not
deserved
shame
and
reproach
and
i
can
not
live
under
it
right
glad
and
happy
am
i
that
a
few
sods
of
earth
will
soon
cover
all
such
remarks
as
these
continued
cousin
janet
convinced
me
that
there
was
grief
but
not
guilt
on
ellen
breast
and
for
her
own
sake
i
hoped
that
she
would
so
explain
to
me
her
past
history
that
i
should
have
it
in
my
power
to
clear
her
reputation
but
she
never
did
truly
died
and
made
no
sign
and
it
is
reserved
to
a
future
day
to
do
her
justice
i
said
she
died
that
last
night
wore
on
and
no
word
of
impatience
or
complaint
escaped
her
lips
the
agony
of
death
found
her
quiet
and
composed
night
advanced
and
the
gray
morning
twilight
fell
on
those
features
no
longer
flushed
and
excited
severe
faintings
had
come
on
and
the
purple
line
under
the
blue
eyes
heralded
the
approach
of
death
her
luxuriant
hair
lay
in
damp
masses
about
her
her
white
arms
were
cold
and
the
moisture
of
death
was
gathering
there
too
miss
ellen
cried
old
lucy
will
be
better
soon
bear
up
a
little
longer
dear
i
said
and
keep
up
but
who
can
give
life
and
strength
save
one
and
he
was
calling
to
her
everlasting
rest
the
poor
young
sufferer
ellen
again
cried
lucy
have
a
son
speak
to
me
my
darling
but
like
rachel
of
old
she
could
not
be
thus
revived
soul
was
in
departing
lucy
bore
away
the
child
from
the
chamber
of
death
and
i
closed
her
white
eyelids
and
laid
her
hands
upon
her
breast
beautiful
was
she
in
death
she
had
done
with
pain
and
tears
forever
i
never
can
forget
continued
cousin
janet
after
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
lucy
grief
she
wept
unceasingly
by
ellen
side
and
it
was
impossible
to
arouse
her
to
a
care
for
her
own
health
or
to
an
interest
in
what
was
passing
around
on
the
day
that
ellen
was
to
be
buried
i
went
to
the
room
where
she
lay
prepared
for
her
last
long
sleep
death
had
laid
a
light
touch
on
her
fair
face
the
sweet
white
brow
round
which
her
hair
waved
as
it
had
in
life
the
slightly
parted
lips
the
expression
of
repose
not
only
in
the
countenance
but
in
the
attitude
in
which
her
old
nurse
had
laid
her
seemed
to
indicate
an
awakening
to
the
duties
of
life
but
there
was
the
coffin
and
the
shroud
and
there
sat
lucy
her
eyes
heavy
with
weeping
and
her
frame
feeble
from
long
fasting
and
indulgence
of
bitter
hopeless
grief
it
was
in
the
winter
and
a
severe
an
unusual
occurrence
with
us
had
swept
the
country
for
several
days
but
on
this
morning
the
wind
and
clouds
had
gone
together
and
the
sun
was
lighting
up
the
hills
and
river
and
the
crystals
of
snow
were
glistening
on
the
evergreens
that
stood
in
front
of
the
cottage
door
one
ray
intruded
through
the
shutter
into
the
darkened
room
and
rested
on
a
ring
which
i
had
never
observed
before
on
ellen
left
hand
it
was
on
the
third
finger
and
its
appearance
there
was
so
unexpected
to
me
that
for
a
moment
my
strength
forsook
me
and
i
leaned
against
the
table
on
which
the
coffin
rested
for
support
i
said
was
that
placed
there
put
it
there
what
induced
you
told
me
to
do
so
a
few
days
before
she
was
taken
sick
she
called
me
and
took
from
her
that
ring
the
ring
was
in
a
small
box
she
was
very
pale
when
she
spoke
she
looked
more
like
death
than
she
does
now
i
know
she
was
able
to
stand
and
i
said
down
honey
and
then
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
said
she
had
a
world
of
trouble
with
me
and
you
had
trouble
of
your
own
all
your
life
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
much
more
i
shall
soon
be
where
trouble
can
not
come
talk
that
way
child
said
i
will
get
through
with
this
and
then
you
will
have
something
to
love
and
to
care
for
that
will
make
you
happy
again
in
this
world
said
she
mammy
i
have
one
favor
more
to
ask
of
you
and
you
must
promise
me
to
do
it
is
it
miss
ellen
said
i
know
i
would
die
for
you
if
do
you
any
good
is
this
she
said
speaking
very
slowly
and
in
a
low
tone
i
am
dead
mammy
when
you
are
all
by
yourself
for
i
am
sure
you
will
stay
by
me
to
the
last
i
want
you
to
put
this
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
my
left
hand
will
you
remember
on
the
third
finger
of
my
left
hand
she
said
it
over
twice
and
she
was
whiter
than
that
rose
that
lays
on
her
poor
breast
ellen
says
i
sure
as
there
a
god
in
heaven
you
are
lee
wife
and
why
do
you
say
so
and
stand
up
for
yourself
do
you
see
how
people
sneer
at
you
when
they
see
you
but
do
say
any
more
it
will
soon
be
over
i
made
a
promise
and
i
will
keep
it
god
will
do
me
justice
when
he
sees
fit
miss
ellen
says
i
the
sake
of
the
child
mammy
that
is
the
worst
of
all
but
i
will
trust
in
him
it
a
dreadful
sin
to
love
as
i
have
but
god
has
punished
me
do
you
remember
dear
mammy
when
i
was
a
child
how
tired
i
would
get
chasing
butterflies
while
the
day
lasted
and
when
night
came
how
i
used
to
spring
and
try
to
catch
the
that
were
flying
around
me
and
you
used
to
beg
me
to
come
in
and
rest
or
go
to
bed
but
i
would
not
until
i
could
no
longer
stand
then
i
laid
myself
on
your
breast
and
forgot
all
my
weariness
so
it
is
with
me
now
i
have
had
my
own
way
and
i
have
suffered
and
have
no
more
strength
to
spend
i
will
lie
down
in
the
grave
and
sleep
where
no
one
will
reproach
me
promise
me
you
will
do
what
i
ask
you
and
i
will
die
contented
promised
her
and
i
have
done
it
is
very
strange
lucy
said
i
seems
to
have
been
a
mysterious
reason
why
she
would
not
clear
herself
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
try
and
unravel
the
mystery
she
has
no
friends
left
to
care
about
it
we
can
only
do
as
she
said
leave
all
to
god
said
lucy
shall
i
do
now
she
is
gone
i
have
got
no
friend
left
if
i
could
only
die
too
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
have
still
a
friend
lucy
i
said
that
well
deserves
the
name
of
friend
you
must
seek
him
out
and
make
a
friend
of
him
jesus
christ
is
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
desolate
have
you
no
children
lucy
only
knows
do
you
mean
i
said
they
all
dead
are
gone
all
sold
i
ai
seen
one
of
them
for
twenty
years
days
have
come
and
gone
and
nights
have
come
and
gone
but
day
and
night
is
all
the
same
to
me
you
did
not
hear
may
be
for
grand
folks
do
often
hear
of
the
troubles
of
the
poor
slave
that
one
day
i
had
seven
children
with
me
and
the
next
they
were
all
sold
taken
off
and
i
did
not
even
see
them
to
bid
them
my
master
sent
me
with
my
mistress
to
the
country
where
her
father
lived
for
she
was
sickly
and
he
said
it
would
do
her
good
and
when
we
came
back
there
was
no
child
to
meet
me
i
have
cried
enough
for
miss
ellen
but
i
never
shed
a
tear
for
my
own
what
induced
him
lucy
to
do
such
a
wicked
thing
and
drinking
and
the
devil
he
did
not
leave
me
one
my
five
boys
and
my
two
girls
all
went
at
once
my
oldest
daughter
i
was
proud
of
her
for
she
was
a
handsome
girl
and
too
she
went
and
the
little
one
my
heart
died
in
me
i
hated
him
i
used
to
dream
i
had
killed
him
and
i
would
laugh
out
in
my
sleep
but
i
could
murder
him
on
her
account
my
mistress
she
cried
day
and
night
and
called
him
cruel
and
she
would
say
i
have
died
before
i
would
have
done
it
i
could
murder
him
was
my
mistress
held
me
back
lucy
said
i
not
your
mistress
it
was
the
lord
and
thank
him
that
you
are
not
a
murderer
did
you
ever
think
of
the
consequences
of
such
an
act
do
you
think
i
cared
for
that
i
was
afraid
of
hanging
did
not
mean
that
lucy
i
meant
did
you
not
fear
his
power
who
could
not
only
kill
your
body
but
destroy
your
soul
in
hell
did
think
of
any
thing
for
a
long
time
my
mistress
got
worse
after
that
and
i
nursed
her
until
she
died
poor
miss
ellen
was
a
baby
and
i
had
her
too
when
master
died
i
thought
it
was
no
use
for
me
to
wish
him
ill
for
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
heavy
on
him
for
true
he
said
are
a
kind
nurse
to
me
though
i
sold
your
children
but
i
had
no
rest
since
i
could
make
him
feel
worse
for
he
was
going
to
his
account
with
all
his
sins
upon
him
is
the
first
time
lucy
i
said
i
have
ever
known
children
to
be
sold
away
from
their
mother
and
i
look
upon
the
crime
with
as
great
a
horror
as
you
do
the
only
time
i
ever
knowed
it
and
everybody
pitied
me
and
many
a
kind
thing
was
said
to
me
and
many
a
hard
word
was
said
of
him
true
enough
but
better
be
forgotten
as
he
is
in
his
grave
some
persons
now
entered
and
lucy
became
absorbed
in
her
present
grief
her
old
frame
shook
as
with
a
tempest
when
the
fair
face
was
hid
from
her
sight
there
were
few
mourners
cousin
weston
and
i
followed
her
to
the
grave
i
believe
ellen
was
as
pure
as
the
white
lilies
lucy
planted
at
her
head
did
lucy
ever
hear
of
her
children
asked
alice
no
my
darling
she
died
soon
after
ellen
she
was
quite
an
old
woman
and
had
never
been
strong
uncle
said
alice
i
did
not
think
any
one
could
be
so
inhuman
as
to
separate
mother
and
children
it
is
the
worst
feature
in
slavery
replied
weston
and
the
state
should
provide
laws
to
prevent
it
but
such
a
circumstance
is
very
uncommon
haywood
ellen
father
was
a
notoriously
bad
man
and
after
this
wicked
act
was
held
in
utter
abhorrence
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
the
interest
of
a
master
to
make
his
slaves
happy
even
were
he
not
actuated
by
better
motives
slavery
is
an
institution
of
our
country
and
while
we
are
privileged
to
maintain
our
rights
we
should
make
them
comfortable
here
and
fit
them
for
happiness
hereafter
did
you
bring
lucy
home
with
you
cousin
janet
asked
alice
yes
my
love
and
little
walter
too
he
was
a
dear
baby
now
he
is
a
man
of
fortune
for
lee
left
him
his
entire
property
and
is
under
no
one
control
he
will
always
be
very
dear
to
me
but
here
comes
mark
with
the
prayer
book
lay
it
here
mark
said
weston
and
ring
the
bell
for
the
servants
i
like
all
who
can
to
come
and
unite
with
me
in
thanking
god
for
his
many
mercies
strange
i
have
opened
the
holy
book
where
david
says
and
we
will
join
with
him
the
lord
oh
my
soul
and
all
that
is
within
me
praise
his
holy
name
chapter
iii
after
the
other
members
of
the
family
had
retired
weston
as
was
usual
with
him
sat
for
a
while
in
the
parlor
to
read
the
closing
hour
of
the
day
is
of
all
the
time
that
we
love
to
dwell
on
the
subject
nearest
our
heart
as
at
the
approach
of
death
the
powers
of
the
mind
rally
and
the
mortal
faint
and
feeble
with
but
a
few
sparks
of
decaying
life
within
him
arouses
to
a
sense
of
his
condition
and
puts
forth
all
his
energies
to
meet
the
hour
of
parting
with
earth
and
turning
his
face
to
heaven
so
at
the
close
of
the
evening
the
mind
wearied
with
its
day
travelling
is
about
to
sink
into
that
repose
as
necessary
for
it
as
for
the
body
that
repose
so
often
compared
to
the
one
in
which
the
tired
struggler
with
life
has
forever
wrapped
the
drapery
of
his
couch
about
him
and
laid
down
to
pleasant
dreams
ere
yielding
it
turns
with
energy
to
the
calls
of
memory
though
it
is
so
soon
to
forget
all
for
a
while
it
hears
voices
long
since
hushed
and
eyes
gaze
into
it
that
have
looked
their
last
upon
earthly
visions
time
is
forgotten
affection
for
a
while
holds
her
reign
sorrow
appears
with
her
train
of
reproachings
and
remorse
until
exhaustion
comes
to
its
aid
and
it
obtains
the
relief
so
bountifully
provided
by
him
who
knoweth
well
our
frames
with
weston
this
last
hour
was
well
employed
for
he
not
only
read
but
studied
the
holy
scriptures
possessed
of
an
unusually
placid
temperament
there
had
occurred
in
his
life
but
few
events
calculated
to
change
the
natural
bent
of
his
disposition
the
death
of
his
wife
was
indeed
a
bitter
grief
but
he
had
not
married
young
and
she
had
lived
so
short
a
time
that
after
a
while
he
returned
to
his
usual
train
of
reflection
but
for
the
constant
presence
of
his
son
whose
early
education
he
superintended
he
would
have
doubted
if
there
ever
had
been
a
reality
to
the
remembrance
of
the
happy
year
he
had
passed
in
her
society
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
sacred
page
and
his
heart
engrossed
with
the
lessons
it
taught
he
was
aroused
from
his
occupation
by
a
loud
noise
proceeding
from
the
kitchen
this
was
a
most
unusual
circumstance
for
besides
that
the
kitchen
was
at
some
distance
from
the
house
the
servants
were
generally
quiet
and
orderly
it
was
far
from
being
the
case
at
present
weston
waited
a
short
time
to
give
affairs
time
to
right
themselves
but
at
length
determined
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
the
confusion
as
he
passed
through
the
long
hall
the
faces
of
his
ancestors
looked
down
upon
him
by
the
dim
light
there
was
a
fair
young
lady
with
an
arm
white
as
snow
unconcealed
by
a
sleeve
unless
the
fall
of
a
rich
border
of
lace
from
her
shoulder
could
be
called
by
that
name
her
golden
hair
was
brushed
back
from
her
forehead
and
fell
in
masses
over
her
shoulders
her
face
was
slightly
turned
and
there
was
a
smile
playing
about
her
mouth
next
her
was
a
cavalier
her
husband
there
were
old
men
with
powdered
hair
and
the
rich
dress
of
bygone
times
there
were
the
hoop
and
the
brocades
and
the
stomacher
and
the
fair
bosom
against
which
a
rose
leaned
well
satisfied
with
its
lounging
place
over
the
hall
doors
the
antlers
of
the
stag
protruded
reminding
one
that
the
chase
had
been
a
favorite
pastime
with
the
sons
of
merry
england
such
things
have
passed
away
from
thee
my
native
state
forever
have
they
gone
and
the
times
when
over
waxed
floors
thy
sons
and
daughters
gracefully
performed
the
minuet
the
stately
bow
the
graceful
curtsey
are
seen
no
more
there
is
hospitality
yet
lingering
in
thy
halls
but
fashion
is
making
its
way
there
too
the
day
when
there
was
a
tie
between
master
and
slave
is
that
departing
and
why
weston
passed
from
the
house
under
a
covered
way
to
the
kitchen
and
with
a
firm
but
slow
step
entered
and
here
if
you
be
an
old
or
a
new
englander
let
me
introduce
you
as
little
at
home
would
be
queen
victoria
holding
court
in
the
sandwich
islands
as
you
here
you
may
look
in
vain
for
that
bane
of
good
dinners
a
cooking
stove
search
forever
for
a
grain
of
saleratus
or
soda
and
it
will
be
in
vain
that
large
round
block
with
the
wooden
hammer
is
the
and
the
cork
that
is
lifting
itself
from
the
jug
standing
on
it
belongs
to
the
yeast
department
weston
did
not
nor
will
we
delay
to
glance
at
the
earthen
floor
and
the
bright
tins
in
rows
on
the
dresser
but
immediately
addressed
himself
to
aunt
peggy
who
seated
in
a
chair
in
the
corner
and
rocking
herself
backwards
and
forwards
was
talking
rapidly
and
oh
what
a
figure
had
aunt
peggy
or
rather
what
a
face
which
was
the
blacker
her
eyes
or
her
visage
or
whiter
her
eyeballs
or
her
hair
the
latter
unconfined
by
her
bandanna
handkerchief
as
she
generally
wore
it
standing
off
from
her
head
in
masses
like
snow
and
who
that
had
seen
her
could
forget
that
one
tooth
projecting
over
her
thick
underlip
and
in
constant
motion
as
she
talked
it
no
use
mister
bacchus
said
she
addressing
the
old
man
who
looked
rather
the
worse
for
wear
it
no
use
to
be
flinging
yer
imperence
in
my
face
worked
my
time
cooked
many
a
grand
dinner
and
eat
too
a
lazy
wagabond
yerself
peggy
interposed
weston
a
lazy
wagabond
yerself
continued
peggy
not
noticing
weston
not
worth
de
hommony

hear
that
master
said
bacchus
appealing
to
weston
such
an
old
fool
hold
your
tongue
sir
said
weston
while
mark
ready
to
strangle
his
for
his
impertinence
was
endeavoring
to
drag
him
out
of
the
room
ha
ha
said
peggy
so
much
for
bacchus
going
to
barbecues
a
nice
waiter
he
makes
do
you
not
see
me
before
you
peggy
said
weston
and
do
you
continue
this
disputing
in
my
presence
if
you
were
not
so
old
and
had
not
been
so
faithful
for
many
years
i
would
not
excuse
such
conduct
you
are
very
ungrateful
when
you
are
so
well
cared
for
and
from
this
time
forward
if
you
can
not
be
quiet
and
set
a
good
example
in
the
kitchen
do
not
come
into
it
do

nobody
and
peggy
hobbled
off
not
without
a
most
contemptuous
look
at
bacchus
who
was
making
unsuccessful
efforts
to
rise
in
compliment
to
his
master
as
for
you
bacchus
said
weston
never
let
this
happen
again
i
will
not

say
so

and

and
bacchus
snapped
his
finger
as
the
only
way
of
concluding
the
sentence
to
his
own
satisfaction
take
him
off
mark
said
weston
the
drunken
old
rascal
master
said
bacchus
pushing
mark
off
i
do
like

to
me

said
weston
again

bacchus
if

said
mark
talking
so
before
master
knock
him
over
john
and
push
him
out
bacchus
was
not
so
easily
overcome
the
god
whose
namesake
he
was
stood
by
him
for
a
time
suddenly
the
old
fellow
mood
changed
with
a
patronizing
smile
he
turned
to
weston
and
said
master
you
must
me
i
aint
well
dis
evening
i
has
the
dyspepsy
my
suggestion
aint
as
good
as
common
i
think
dat
ox
was
done
too
much
weston
could
not
restrain
a
smile
at
his
grotesque
appearance
and
ridiculous
language
mark
and
john
took
advantage
of
the
melting
mood
which
had
come
over
him
and
led
him
off
without
difficulty
on
leaving
the
kitchen
he
went
into
a
pious
fit
and
sung
out
when
i
can
read
my
title
clar
weston
heard
him
say
do
mark
do
squeeze
an
ole
nigger
so
do
you
you
ever
get
to
heaven
if
you
got
no
more
feelins
than
that
i
hope
said
weston
addressing
the
other
servants
that
you
will
all
take
warning
by
this
scene
an
honest
and
respectable
servant
like
bacchus
to
degrade
himself
in
this
way
it
gives
me
great
pain
to
see
it
william
said
he
addressing
a
son
of
bacchus
who
stood
by
the
window
did
you
deliver
my
note
to
mr
walter
yes
sir
he
says
he
come
to
dinner
i
was
on
my
way
in
to
tell
you
but
they
was
making
such
a
fuss
here
very
well
said
weston
the
rest
of
you
go
to
bed
quietly
i
am
sure
there
will
be
no
more
disturbance
but
what
will
the
abolitionist
say
to
this
scene
where
were
the
whip
and
the
cord
and
other
instruments
of
torture
such
consideration
he
contends
was
never
shown
in
the
southern
country
with
martin
tupper
i
say
hear
reason
oh
brother
hear
reason
and
right
it
has
been
that
master
and
slave
were
friends
and
if
this
can
not
continue
at
whose
door
will
the
sin
lie
the
abolitionist
says
to
the
slave
go
but
what
does
he
do
that
really
advances
his
interest
he
says
to
the
master
give
up
thine
own
but
does
he
offer
to
share
in
the
loss
no
he
would
give
to
the
lord
of
that
which
costs
him
nothing
should
the
southern
country
become
free
should
the
eyes
of
the
world
see
no
stain
upon
her
escutcheon
it
will
not
be
through
the
efforts
of
these
fanatics
if
white
labor
could
be
substituted
for
black
better
were
it
that
she
should
not
have
this
weight
upon
her
the
emancipation
of
her
slaves
will
never
be
accomplished
by
interference
or
force
good
men
assist
in
colonizing
them
and
the
creator
may
thus
intend
to
christianize
benighted
africa
should
this
be
the
divine
will
oh
that
from
every
port
steamers
were
going
forth
bearing
our
colored
people
to
their
natural
home
chapter
iv
my
readers
must
go
with
me
to
a
military
station
at
the
north
and
date
back
two
years
from
the
time
of
my
story
the
season
must
change
and
instead
of
summer
sunsets
and
roses
we
will
bring
before
them
three
feet
of
snow
and
winter
bleakest
winds
neither
of
these
inconvenienced
the
company
assembled
in
the
comfortable
little
parlor
of
captain
moore
quarters
with
a
almost
as
large
as
the
room
and
curtains
closely
drawn
over
the
old
style
windows
moore
was
reduced
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
her
wits
to
make
the
room
look
modern
but
it
is
astonishing
the
genius
of
army
ladies
for
putting
the
best
foot
foremost
this
room
was
neither
square
nor
oblong
and
though
a
mere
box
in
size
it
had
no
less
than
four
doors
two
belonged
to
the
closets
and
three
windows
the
closets
were
utterly
useless
being
occupied
by
an
indomitable
race
of
rats
and
mice
they
had
an
impregnable
fortress
somewhere
in
the
old
walls
and
kept
possession
in
spite
of
the
artillery
moore
levelled
against
them
the
poor
woman
gave
up
in
despair
she
locked
the
doors
and
determined
to
starve
the
garrison
into
submission
she
was
far
more
successful
in
other
respects
having
completely
banished
the
spirits
of
formality
and
inhospitality
that
presided
in
these
domains
the
house
was
outside
the
fort
and
had
been
purchased
from
a
citizen
who
lived
there
totally
apart
from
his
race
moore
had
the
comfort
of
hearing
on
taking
possession
that
all
sorts
of
ghosts
were
at
home
there
but
she
was
a
cheerful
kind
of
woman
and
did
not
believe
in
them
any
more
than
she
did
in
clairvoyance
so
she
set
to
work
with
a
brave
heart
and
every
thing
yielded
to
her
sway
excepting
the
aforesaid
rats
and
mice
her
parlor
was
the
very
realization
of
home
comfort
the
lounge
by
the
three
windows
was
covered
with
small
figured
french
chintz
and
it
was
a
delightful
seat
or
bed
as
the
occasion
required
she
had
the
legs
of
several
of
the
chairs
sawed
off
and
made
cushions
for
them
covered
with
pieces
of
the
chintz
left
from
the
lounge
the
armchairs
that
looked
at
each
other
from
either
side
of
the
fireplace
place
not
being
of
velvet
were
made
to
sit
in
in
one
corner
of
the
room
there
were
five
a
guitar
rested
against
the
wall
in
another
was
a
large
of
peacock
feathers
with
a
most
unconscionable
number
of
eyes
in
the
third
was
captain
moore
sword
and
sash
in
the
fourth
was
moore
where
any
amount
of
thimbles
needles
and
all
sorts
of
sewing
implements
could
be
found
and
in
the
fifth
corner
was
the
its
fat
and
habitual
occupant
being
at
this
time
oblivious
to
the
day
exertions
in
point
of
fact
he
was
up
stairs
in
a
red
pine
crib
sound
asleep
with
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
one
of
chickering
best
pianos
stood
open
in
this
wonderful
little
parlor
and
moore
rung
out
sweet
sounds
from
it
evening
after
evening
was
an
industrious
intelligent
southern
woman
before
she
met
captain
moore
she
had
a
sort
of
antipathy
to
dogs
and
yankees
both
however
suddenly
disappeared
for
after
a
short
acquaintance
she
fell
desperately
in
love
with
the
captain
and
allowed
his
great
newfoundland
dog
who
had
saved
the
captain
and
a
great
number
of
boys
from
drowning
to
lick
her
hand
and
rest
his
cold
black
nose
on
her
lap
on
this
evening
neptune
lay
at
her
feet
and
was
another
ornament
of
the
parlor
indeed
he
should
have
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
for
wherever
the
baby
was
in
the
day
time
there
was
neptune
but
he
seemed
to
think
that
a
newfoundland
dog
had
other
duties
incumbent
upon
him
in
the
evening
than
watching
babies
so
he
listened
attentively
to
the
music
dozing
now
and
then
sometimes
during
a
very
loud
strain
he
would
suddenly
rouse
and
look
intently
at
the
but
finding
himself
mistaken
that
he
had
only
dreamed
it
was
a
river
and
that
a
boy
who
was
fishing
on
its
banks
had
tumbled
in
and
required
his
services
to
pull
him
out
would
fall
down
on
the
rug
again
and
take
another
nap
i
have
said
nothing
of
this
rug
which
neptune
thought
was
purchased
for
him
nor
of
the
bright
red
carpet
nor
of
the
nice
china
candlesticks
on
the
which
could
not
be
reached
without
a
nor
of
the
silver
urn
which
was
moore
nor
of
the
which
lit
up
every
thing
astonishingly
because
i
am
anxious
to
come
to
the
point
of
this
chapter
and
can
not
do
justice
to
all
these
things
but
it
would
be
the
height
of
injustice
in
me
to
pass
by
lieutenant
jones
moustaches
for
the
simple
reason
that
since
the
close
of
the
mexican
war
he
had
done
little
else
but
cultivate
them
they
were
very
brown
glossy
and
luxuriant
entirely
covering
his
upper
lip
so
that
it
was
only
in
a
hearty
laugh
that
one
would
have
any
reason
to
suppose
he
had
cut
his
front
teeth
but
he
had
and
they
were
worth
cutting
too
which
is
not
always
the
case
with
teeth
the
object
of
wearing
these
moustaches
was
evidently
to
give
himself
a
warlike
and
ferocious
appearance
in
this
he
was
partially
successful
having
the
drawbacks
of
a
remarkably
gentle
and
humane
countenance
and
a
pair
of
mild
blue
eyes
he
was
a
very
young
man
and
had
shot
a
wild
turkey
in
mexico
the
tail
of
which
he
had
brought
home
to
moore
to
be
made
into
a
fan
this
fan
too
was
in
the
parlor
of
which
may
be
said
what
was
once
thought
of
the
schoolmaster
head
that
the
only
wonder
was
it
could
contain
so
much
next
to
jones
we
will
notice
a
lieutenant
just
attached
to
the
regiment
and
then
introduce
a
handsome
bachelor
captain
these
are
scarce
in
the
army
and
should
be
valued
accordingly
this
gentleman
was
a
fine
musician
and
the
brevet
played
delightfully
on
the
flute
in
fact
they
had
had
quite
a
concert
this
evening
then
there
was
colonel
watson
the
commanding
officer
who
had
happened
in
moore
being
an
especial
favorite
of
his
and
there
was
a
long
lean
gentleman
by
the
name
of
kent
he
was
from
vermont
and
was
an
ultra
abolitionist
they
had
all
just
returned
from
the
where
they
had
been
eating
cold
turkey
and
mince
pies
and
though
there
was
a
fair
chance
of
the
nightmare
some
hours
hence
yet
for
the
present
they
were
in
an
exceedingly
high
state
of
health
and
spirits
now
moore
had
brought
from
carolina
a
woman
quite
advanced
in
life
she
had
been
a
very
faithful
servant
and
moore
mother
wishing
her
daughter
to
have
the
benefit
of
her
services
and
feeling
perfect
confidence
in
polly
promise
that
under
no
circumstances
would
she
leave
her
daughter
without
just
cause
had
concluded
that
the
best
way
of
managing
affairs
would
be
to
set
her
free
at
once
she
did
so
but
polly
being
one
of
those
persons
who
take
the
world
quietly
was
not
the
least
elated
at
being
her
own
mistress
she
rather
felt
it
to
be
a
kind
of
experiment
to
which
there
was
some
risk
attached
moore
paid
her
six
dollars
a
month
for
her
services
and
from
the
time
they
had
left
home
together
until
the
present
moment
polly
had
been
a
most
efficient
servant
and
a
sort
of
friend
whose
opinions
were
valuable
in
a
case
of
emergency
for
instance
captain
moore
was
a
temperance
man
and
in
consequence
opposed
to
brandy
wine
and
the
like
being
kept
in
his
house
this
was
quite
a
trouble
to
his
wife
for
she
knew
that
good
mince
pies
and
pudding
sauces
could
not
be
made
without
a
little
of
the
wherewithal
so
she
laid
her
difficulties
before
aunt
polly
and
begged
her
to
advise
what
was
best
to
do
you
see
aunt
polly
captain
moore
says
that
a
good
example
ought
to
be
set
to
the
soldiers
and
that
since
the
mexican
war
the
young
officers
are
more
inclined
to
indulge
than
they
used
to
be
that
he
feels
such
a
responsibility
in
the
case
that
he
ca
bear
the
sight
of
a
bottle
in
the
house
well
honey
said
aunt
polly
he
says
he
likes
my
mince
pies
and
my
puddins
mightily
and
does
he
me
to
make
good
and
make
out
of
nothin
too
that
what
i
say
aunt
polly
for
you
know
none
of
us
like
to
drink
the
captain
belongs
to
the
temperance
society
and
i
do
like
it
because
it
gets
into
my
head
and
makes
me
stupid
and
you
never
drink
any
thing
so
if
we
could
only
manage
to
get
him
to
let
us
keep
it
to
cook
with
as
to
that
child
said
aunt
polly
i
mus
have
it
to
cook
with
that
a
pint
settled
there
aint
no
use
about
it
if
he
thinks
i
gwine
to
change
my
way
of
cookin
in
my
old
age
he
mightily
mistaken
he
think
i
gwine
to
make
puddins
out
o
one
egg
and
lighten
my
muffins
with
snow
like
these
ere
yankees
i
aint
gwine
to
do
it
for
nobody
i
sot
out
to
do
my
duty
by
you
and
i
do
it
but
for
all
that
i
aint
bound
to
set
to
larnin
new
things
this
time
o
day
i
cook
carolina
fashion
or
i
wont
cook
at
all
well
but
what
shall
i
do
said
moore
you
would
have
me
do
a
thing
my
husband
disapproves
of
would
you
no
that
i
would
miss
emmy
said
aunt
polly
my
old
man
dust
and
ashes
long
ago
but
i
always
done
what
i
could
to
please
him
men
mighty
onreasonable
the
best
of
but
when
a
woman
is
married
she
ought
to
do
all
she
can
for
the
sake
of
peace
i
dont
see
what
a
man
has
got
to
do
interferin
with
the
cookin
no
how
a
woman
oughter
to
these
matters
to
me
moore
captain
as
you
calls
him
is
mighty
fidjetty
about
bottles
all
at
once
but
if
he
cant
bear
the
sight
of
a
brandy
bottle
in
the
house
bring
down
here
to
me
i
keep
out
of
his
sight
i
be
bound
i
put
in
the
corner
of
my
old
chist
yonder
and
i
like
to
see
him
thar
rummagin
arter
brandy
bottles
or
any
thing
else
moore
was
very
much
relieved
by
this
suggestion
and
when
her
husband
came
in
she
enlarged
on
the
necessity
of
polly
having
her
own
way
about
the
cooking
and
wound
up
by
saying
that
polly
must
take
charge
of
all
the
bottles
and
by
this
arrangement
he
would
not
be
annoyed
by
the
sight
of
them
but
my
dear
said
he
do
you
think
it
right
to
give
such
things
in
charge
of
a
servant
why
aunt
polly
never
drinks
yes
but
emmy
you
do
consider
the
temptation
la
william
do
hush
why
if
you
talk
about
temptation
she
had
that
all
her
life
and
she
could
have
drank
herself
to
death
long
ago
just
say
yes
and
be
done
with
it
for
it
has
worried
me
to
death
all
day
and
i
want
it
settled
and
off
my
mind
well
do
as
you
like
said
captain
moore
but
remember
it
will
be
your
fault
if
any
thing
happens
nothing
is
going
to
happen
said
moore
jumping
up
and
seizing
the
wine
and
brandy
bottles
by
the
necks
and
descending
to
the
lower
regions
with
them
here
they
are
aunt
polly
william
consents
to
your
having
them
and
mind
you
keep
them
out
of
sight
set
down
in
the
cheer
thar
i
take
care
of
i
jist
wanted
some
brandy
to
put
in
these
potato
puddins
i
wonder
what
they
taste
like
without
it
but
moore
could
not
wait
to
talk
about
it
she
was
up
stairs
in
another
moment
holding
her
baby
on
neptune
back
and
more
at
ease
in
her
mind
than
she
had
been
since
the
subject
was
started
hours
before
there
was
but
one
other
servant
in
the
house
a
woman
who
had
run
away
from
her
mistress
in
boston
or
rather
she
had
been
seduced
off
by
the
abolitionists
while
many
would
have
done
well
under
the
circumstances
susan
had
never
been
happy
or
comfortable
since
this
occurred
besides
the
that
annoyed
her
for
she
had
been
brought
on
from
georgia
to
nurse
a
sick
child
and
its
mother
a
very
feeble
person
had
placed
her
dependence
upon
her
susan
was
illy
calculated
to
shift
for
herself
she
was
a
timid
delicate
woman
with
rather
a
romantic
cast
of
mind
her
mistress
had
always
been
an
invalid
and
was
fond
of
hearing
her
favorite
books
read
aloud
for
the
style
of
books
that
susan
had
been
accustomed
to
listen
to
as
she
sat
at
her
sewing
lalla
rookh
would
be
a
good
specimen
and
as
she
had
never
been
put
to
hard
work
but
had
merely
been
an
attendant
about
her
room
most
of
her
time
was
occupied
in
a
literary
way
thus
having
an
excellent
memory
her
head
was
a
sort
of
for
lovesick
snatches
of
song
the
museum
men
would
represent
her
as
having
snatched
a
feather
of
the
bird
of
song
but
as
this
is
a
kind
of
story
we
will
observe
that
susan
not
being
naturally
very
and
her
education
not
more
advanced
than
to
enable
her
to
spell
out
an
antiquated
valentine
or
to
write
a
letter
with
a
great
many
small
i
in
it
she
is
rather
to
be
considered
the
victim
of
circumstances
and
a
soft
heart
she
was
nevertheless
a
conscientious
woman
and
when
she
left
georgia
to
come
north
had
any
one
told
her
that
she
would
run
away
she
would
have
answered
in
the
spirit
if
not
the
expression
of
the
oft
quoted
is
thy
servant
a
dog
she
enjoyed
the
journey
to
the
north
the
more
that
the
little
baby
improved
very
much
in
strength
she
had
had
at
her
own
wish
the
entire
charge
of
him
from
his
birth
the
family
had
not
been
two
days
at
the
revere
house
before
susan
found
herself
an
object
of
interest
to
men
who
were
gentlemen
if
broadcloth
and
boots
could
constitute
that
valuable
article
these
individuals
seemed
to
know
as
much
of
her
as
she
did
of
herself
though
they
plied
her
with
questions
to
a
degree
that
quite
disarranged
her
usual
calm
and
poetic
flow
of
ideas
as
to
whether
she
had
been
born
a
slave
or
had
been
kidnapped
whether
she
had
ever
been
sold
how
many
times
a
week
she
had
been
whipped
and
what
with
had
she
ever
been
shut
up
in
a
dark
cellar
and
nearly
starved
was
she
allowed
more
than
one
meal
a
day
did
she
ever
have
any
thing
but
sweet
potato
pealings
had
she
ever
been
ducked
and
finally
she
was
desired
to
open
her
mouth
that
they
might
see
whether
her
teeth
had
been
extracted
to
sell
to
the
dentist
poor
susan
after
one
or
two
interviews
her
feelings
were
terribly
agitated
all
these
horrible
suggestions
realities
and
though
she
loved
her
home
her
mistress
and
the
baby
too
yet
she
was
finally
convinced
that
though
born
a
slave
it
was
not
the
intention
of
providence
but
a
mistake
and
that
she
had
been
miraculously
led
to
this
western
holy
land
of
which
boston
is
the
jerusalem
as
the
means
by
which
things
could
be
set
to
rights
again
one
beautiful
bright
evening
when
her
mistress
had
rode
out
to
see
the
state
house
by
moonlight
susan
kissed
the
baby
not
without
many
tears
and
then
threw
herself
trembling
and
dismayed
into
the
arms
and
tender
mercies
of
the
abolitionists
they
led
her
into
a
distant
part
of
the
city
and
placed
her
for
the
night
under
the
charge
of
some
people
who
made
their
living
by
receiving
the
newly
ransomed
the
next
morning
she
was
to
go
off
but
she
found
she
had
reckoned
without
her
host
for
when
she
thanked
the
good
people
for
her
night
lodging
and
the
hashed
on
which
she
had
tried
to
breakfast
she
had
a
bill
to
pay
and
where
was
the
money
poor
susan
she
had
only
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
and
that
she
had
asked
her
mistress
for
a
week
before
to
buy
a
pair
of
why
what
a
fool
you
be
said
one
of
the
men
did
i
tell
you
to
bring
your
mistress
purse
along
and
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
steal
besides
running
off
from
her
and
the
poor
baby
answered
susan
it
not
stealing
said
the
abolitionist
have
you
been
a
slaving
of
yourself
all
your
life
for
her
and
i
guess
you
a
right
to
be
paid
for
it
i
guess
you
think
the
rags
on
your
back
good
wages
enough
susan
looked
at
her
neat
dress
and
thought
they
were
very
nice
rags
compared
to
the
clothes
her
landlady
had
on
but
the
abolitionist
was
in
a
hurry
come
said
he
i
not
going
to
spend
all
my
time
on
you
if
you
want
to
be
free
come
along
pay
what
you
owe
and
start
but
i
have
only
this
quarter
said
susan
despairingly
i
do
calculate
to
give
runaway
niggers
their
supper
and
lodging
and
breakfast
for
cents
said
the
woman
i
aint
so
green
as
that
i
can
tell
you
if
you
got
no
money
open
your
bundle
and
we
can
make
a
trade
like
as
not
susan
opened
her
bundle
which
was
a
good
strong
her
mistress
had
given
her
and
after
some
hesitation
the
woman
selected
as
her
due
a
nice
imitation
of
cashmere
shawl
the
last
present
her
mistress
had
given
her
it
had
cost
four
dollars
susan
could
hardly
give
it
up
she
wanted
to
keep
it
as
a
remembrance
but
she
already
felt
herself
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
and
she
fastened
up
her
and
set
forward
she
was
carried
off
in
the
cars
to
an
interior
town
and
directed
to
the
house
of
an
abolitionist
to
whom
she
was
to
hire
herself
her
fare
was
paid
by
this
person
and
then
deducted
from
her
wages
her
wages
were
four
dollars
a
month
she
cooked
and
washed
for
ten
in
family
cleaned
the
whole
house
and
did
all
except
sawing
the
wood
which
the
gentleman
of
the
house
did
himself
she
was
only
required
to
split
the
hard
large
knots
the
oldest
son
splitting
the
easy
sticks
for
her
on
saturday
the
only
extra
duty
required
of
her
was
to
mend
every
item
of
clothing
worn
in
the
family
the
lady
of
the
house
making
them
herself
susan
felt
very
much
as
if
it
was
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
or
rather
as
if
she
had
been
transferred
from
one
master
to
another
she
found
it
took
all
her
wages
to
buy
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
flannel
for
her
health
suffered
very
much
from
the
harsh
climate
and
her
new
mode
of
life
so
she
ventured
to
ask
for
an
increase
of
a
dollar
a
month
is
that
your
gratitude
was
the
indignant
reply
for
all
that
we
done
for
you
the
idea
of
a
nigger
wanting
over
four
dollars
a
month
when
you
been
working
all
your
life
too
for
nothing
at
all
why
everybody
in
town
is
wondering
that
i
keep
you
when
white
help
is
so
much
better
but
replied
susan
they
tell
me
here
that
a
woman
gets
six
dollars
a
month
when
she
does
the
whole
work
of
a
family
a
woman
does
said
this
abolitionist
lady
but
not
a
nigger
i
guess
besides
if
they
do
you
ought
to
be
willing
to
work
cheaper
for
abolitionists
for
they
are
your
friends
if
save
me
from
my
friends
had
been
in
lalla
rookh
susan
would
certainly
have
applied
it
but
as
the
quotation
belonged
to
the
heroic
rather
than
the
sentimental
department
she
could
not
avail
herself
of
it
and
therefore
went
on
chopping
her
codfish
and
onions
together
at
the
rate
of
four
dollars
a
month
and
very
weak
eyes
till
some
good
wind
blew
captain
moore
to
the
command
of
his
company
in
the
fort
near
the
town
after
moore
housekeeping
operations
had
fairly
commenced
she
found
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
a
person
to
clean
the
house
of
four
rooms
and
to
help
neptune
mind
the
baby
aunt
polly
accordingly
set
forward
on
an
exploration
she
presented
quite
an
unusual
appearance
as
regards
her
style
of
dress
she
wore
a
plaid
domestic
gingham
gown
she
had
several
stuff
ones
but
she
declared
she
never
put
one
of
them
on
for
any
thing
less
than
meetin
she
had
a
black
satin
methodist
bonnet
very
much
the
shape
of
a
coal
hod
and
the
color
of
her
own
complexion
only
there
was
a
slight
shade
of
blue
in
it
thick
gloves
and
shoes
and
stockings
a
white
cotton
apron
and
a
tremendous
blanket
shawl
completed
her
costume
she
had
a
most
determined
expression
of
countenance
the
fact
is
she
had
gone
out
to
get
a
and
she
did
intend
to
return
without
one
i
forgot
to
mention
that
she
walked
with
a
cane
having
had
a
severe
attack
of
rheumatics
since
her
arrival
in
the
great
norrurd
and
at
every
step
she
hit
the
pavements
in
such
a
manner
as
to
startle
the
rising
generation
of
abolitionists
and
it
had
the
good
effect
of
preventing
any
of
them
from
calling
out
to
her
where
did
you
get
your
face
painted
you
black
nigger
you
which
would
otherwise
have
occurred
susan
was
just
returning
from
a
grocery
store
with
three
codfish
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
salt
pork
and
a
jug
of
molasses
in
the
other
when
she
was
startled
by
aunt
polly
unexpected
appearance
bearing
down
upon
her
like
a
man
of
war
aunt
polly
stopped
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
her
intensely
while
feelings
which
like
her
poetry
had
for
some
time
been
quite
subdued
by
constant
collision
with
a
cooking
stove
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
burst
into
tears
aunt
polly
made
up
her
mind
on
the
spot
it
was
as
she
afterwards
expressed
it
meracle
meeting
that
poor
girl
with
all
that
codfish
and
other
stuff
in
her
hand
susan
did
not
require
too
much
encouragement
to
tell
her
lamentable
tale
and
aunt
polly
in
return
advised
her
to
leave
her
place
when
her
month
was
up
informing
the
family
of
her
intention
that
they
might
supply
themselves
this
susan
promised
to
do
with
a
full
heart
and
aunt
polly
having
accomplished
her
mission
set
out
on
her
return
first
saying
to
susan
however
we
wait
for
you
you
need
be
afeard
and
i
do
your
work
you
come
much
for
we
puts
out
our
washin
and
you
be
sceard
when
you
see
the
sogers
they
aint
gwine
to
hurt
you
though
they
do
look
so
savage
susan
gave
notice
of
her
intention
and
after
a
season
of
martyrdom
set
forward
to
find
captain
moore
quarters
she
had
no
difficulty
for
polly
was
looking
out
for
her
with
her
pipe
in
her
mouth
come
in
child
said
she
and
warm
yourself
how
is
your
cough
i
stewed
some
molasses
for
you
you
come
we
go
up
and
see
miss
emmy
presently
she
you
susan
was
duly
introduced
to
moore
who
was
at
the
time
sitting
in
the
captain
lap
with
the
baby
in
hers
and
neptune
forepaws
in
the
baby
the
captain
temperance
principles
did
not
forbid
him
smoking
a
good
cigar
and
at
the
moment
of
susan
entrance
he
was
in
the
act
of
emitting
stealthily
a
cloud
of
smoke
into
his
wife
face
after
letting
the
baby
fall
out
of
her
lap
and
taking
two
or
three
short
breaths
with
strong
symptoms
of
choking
moore
with
a
husky
voice
and
very
red
eyes
welcomed
susan
and
introduced
her
to
the
baby
and
neptune
then
told
aunt
polly
to
show
her
where
to
put
her
clothes
and
to
make
her
comfortable
in
every
respect
aunt
polly
did
so
by
baking
her
a
and
broiling
a
herring
and
drawing
a
cup
of
strong
tea
susan
went
to
bed
scared
with
her
new
happiness
and
dreamed
she
was
in
georgia
in
her
old
room
with
the
sick
baby
in
her
arms
susan
the
abolitionists
were
highly
indignant
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
they
had
accordingly
a
new
and
fruitful
subject
of
discussion
at
the
sewing
societies
and
quilting
bees
of
the
town
in
solemn
conclave
it
was
decided
to
vote
army
people
down
as
utterly
disagreeable
one
old
maid
suggested
the
propriety
of
their
immediately
getting
up
a
petition
for
disbanding
the
army
but
the
motion
was
laid
on
the
table
in
consideration
of
john
quincy
adams
being
dead
and
buried
and
therefore
not
in
a
condition
to
present
the
petition
susan
became
quite
cheerful
and
gained
twenty
pounds
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
though
strange
rumors
continued
to
float
about
the
army
it
was
stated
at
a
meeting
of
the
female
society
for
setting
the
world
to
rights
that
army
folks
were
a
low
dissipated
set
for
they
put
wine
in
their
sauce
i
do
not
mean
to
say
liberty
is
not
next
to
life
the
greatest
of
earthly
gifts
and
that
men
and
women
ought
not
to
be
happier
free
than
slaves
god
forbid
that
i
should
so
have
read
my
bible
but
such
cases
as
susan
do
occur
and
far
oftener
than
the
and
stories
with
which
harriet
beecher
stowe
has
seen
fit
to
embellish
that
interesting
romance
uncle
tom
cabin
chapter
capt
moore
suddenly
seized
the
poker
and
commenced
stirring
the
fire
vigorously
neptune
rushed
to
his
covert
under
the
piano
and
moore
called
out
dont
dear
for
heaven
sake
why
it
getting
cold
said
captain
moore
apologetically
do
you
hear
the
wind
yes
but
i
do
feel
it
neither
do
you
the
fire
can
not
be
improved
see
how
you
have
made
the
dust
fly
you
never
can
let
well
alone
that
is
the
trouble
with
the
abolitionists
said
colonel
watson
they
ca
let
well
alone
and
so
kent
and
his
party
want
to
reorganize
the
southern
country
there
is
no
well
there
to
let
alone
said
kent
with
the
air
of
a
solomon
do
talk
so
kent
said
moore
entreatingly
for
i
quarrel
with
you
in
my
own
house
and
i
feel
very
much
inclined
to
do
so
for
that
one
sentence
now
said
the
bachelor
captain
i
do
long
to
hear
you
and
kent
discuss
abolition
the
colonel
and
i
may
be
considered
disinterested
listeners
as
we
hail
from
the
middle
states
and
are
not
politicians
captain
moore
can
not
interfere
as
he
is
host
as
well
as
husband
and
jones
and
scott
have
eaten
too
much
to
feel
much
interest
in
any
thing
just
now
pray
tell
kent
my
dear
madam
of
susan
getting
you
to
intercede
with
her
mistress
to
take
her
back
and
see
what
he
says
i
know
it
already
said
kent
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
surprised
to
find
moore
inducing
a
to
return
to
a
condition
so
dreadful
as
that
of
a
southern
slave
after
having
been
plucked
from
the
fire
it
should
be
painful
to
the
human
mind
to
see
her
thrown
in
again
your
simile
is
not
a
good
one
kent
said
moore
with
a
heightened
color
i
can
make
a
better
susan
in
a
moment
of
delirium
jumped
into
the
fire
and
she
called
on
me
to
pull
her
out
unfortunately
i
can
not
heal
all
the
burns
for
i
yesterday
received
an
answer
to
my
letter
to
her
mistress
who
positively
refuses
to
take
her
back
she
is
willing
but
casey
will
not
consent
to
it
he
says
that
his
wife
was
made
very
sick
by
the
shock
of
losing
susan
and
the
necessary
in
the
care
of
her
child
the
baby
died
in
boston
and
they
can
not
overlook
susan
deserting
it
at
a
hotel
without
any
one
to
take
charge
of
it
they
placing
such
perfect
confidence
in
susan
too
he
thinks
her
presence
would
constantly
recall
to
casey
her
child
death
besides
after
having
lived
among
abolitionists
he
fancies
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
bring
her
on
the
plantation
having
attained
her
freedom
he
says
she
must
make
the
best
of
it
casey
enclosed
me
ten
dollars
to
give
to
susan
for
i
wrote
her
she
was
in
bad
health
and
had
very
little
clothing
when
she
came
to
me
poor
girl
i
could
hardly
persuade
her
to
take
the
money
and
soon
after
she
brought
it
to
me
and
asked
me
to
keep
it
for
her
and
not
to
change
the
note
that
came
from
home
i
felt
very
sorry
for
her
she
deserves
it
said
kent
i
think
she
does
said
moore
smiling
though
for
another
reason
kent
blushed
as
only
men
with
light
hair
and
light
skin
and
light
eyes
can
blush
i
mean
said
kent
furiously
she
deserves
her
refusal
for
her
ingratitude
after
god
provided
her
friends
who
made
her
a
free
woman
she
is
so
senseless
as
to
want
to
go
back
to
be
lashed
and
trodden
under
foot
again
as
the
slaves
of
the
south
are
i
say
she
deserves
it
for
being
such
a
fool
and
i
say
said
moore
she
deserves
it
for
deserting
her
kind
mistress
at
a
time
when
she
most
needed
her
services
god
did
not
raise
her
up
friends
because
she
had
done
wrong
you
are
right
emmy
in
your
views
of
susan
conduct
but
you
should
be
careful
how
you
trace
motives
to
such
a
source
she
certainly
did
wrong
and
she
has
suffered
that
is
all
we
can
say
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
to
restore
her
to
health
she
is
very
happy
with
us
now
and
will
no
doubt
after
a
while
enjoy
her
liberty
it
would
be
a
most
unnatural
thing
if
she
did
not
but
how
is
it
kent
said
the
colonel
that
after
you
induce
these
poor
devils
to
give
up
their
homes
that
you
do
not
start
them
in
life
set
them
going
in
some
way
in
the
new
world
to
which
you
transfer
them
you
do
not
give
them
a
copper
i
am
told
we
do
calculate
to
do
that
said
kent
i
believe
you
said
moore
maliciously
kent
looked
indignant
at
the
interruption
while
his
discomfiture
was
very
amusing
to
the
young
officers
they
being
devoted
admirers
of
moore
talents
and
mince
pies
they
laughed
heartily
and
kent
looked
at
them
as
if
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
overlook
their
impertinence
but
the
fact
that
they
were
very
low
on
the
list
of
lieutenants
and
he
was
an
abolition
agent
we
calculate
sir
to
give
them
their
freedom
and
then
let
them
look
out
for
themselves
that
is
you
have
no
objection
to
their
living
in
the
same
world
with
yourself
provided
it
costs
you
nothing
said
the
colonel
we
make
them
free
said
kent
they
have
their
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
they
are
no
longer
enslaved
body
and
soul
if
i
see
a
man
with
his
hands
and
feet
chained
and
i
break
those
chains
it
is
all
that
god
expects
me
to
do
let
him
earn
his
own
living
but
suppose
he
does
not
know
how
to
do
so
said
moore
what
then
the
occupations
of
a
negro
at
the
south
are
so
different
from
those
of
the
people
at
the
north
thank
god
they
are
said
kent
grandly
we
have
no
overseers
to
draw
the
blood
of
their
fellow
creatures
and
masters
to
look
on
and
laugh
we
do
not
snatch
infants
from
their
mothers
breasts
and
sell
them
for
whisky
neither
do
we
said
moore
her
bosom
heaving
with
emotion
no
one
but
an
abolitionist
could
have
had
such
a
wicked
thought
no
wonder
that
men
who
glory
in
breaking
the
laws
of
their
country
should
make
such
misstatements
madam
said
kent
they
are
facts
we
can
prove
them
and
we
say
that
the
slaves
of
the
south
shall
be
free
cost
what
it
will
the
men
of
the
north
have
set
out
to
emancipate
them
and
they
will
do
it
if
they
have
to
wade
through
fire
water
and
blood
you
had
better
not
talk
in
that
style
when
you
go
south
said
captain
moore
unless
you
have
an
unconquerable
prejudice
in
favor
of
tar
and
feathers
who
cares
for
tar
and
feathers
said
kent
there
has
been
already
a
martyr
in
the
ranks
of
abolition
and
there
may
be
more
lovejoy
died
a
glorious
martyr
death
and
there
are
others
ready
to
do
the
same
give
me
my
cane
there
captain
if
you
please
said
colonel
watson
who
had
been
looking
at
kent
blazing
countenance
and
projecting
eyes
in
utter
amazement
why
buena
vista
was
nothing
to
this
good
night
madam
and
do
tell
susan
not
to
jump
into
the
fire
again
i
wonder
she
was
not
burned
up
while
she
was
there
come
captain
let
us
make
our
escape
while
we
can
the
captain
followed
bidding
the
whole
party
good
night
with
a
smile
he
had
been
perfectly
charmed
with
the
abolition
discussion
jones
had
got
very
sleepy
and
he
and
scott
made
their
adieu
kent
with
some
embarrassment
bade
moore
good
night
moore
begged
him
to
go
south
and
be
converted
for
she
believed
his
whole
heart
required
changing
captain
moore
followed
them
to
the
door
and
shivered
as
he
inhaled
the
come
emmy
said
he
as
he
entered
rubbing
his
hands
you
fought
for
your
country
this
night
let
go
to
bed
moore
lit
a
candle
and
put
out
the
wondering
if
she
had
been
impolite
to
kent
she
led
the
way
to
the
staircase
in
a
reflective
state
of
mind
neptune
followed
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
for
some
moments
in
deep
thought
concluding
that
if
there
should
be
danger
of
any
one
falling
into
a
river
up
there
they
would
call
him
and
let
him
know
he
went
back
laid
down
on
the
soft
rug
and
fell
asleep
for
the
night
it
does
not
take
long
to
state
a
fact
kent
went
to
washington
on
abolition
business
through
the
introduction
of
a
senator
from
his
own
state
he
obtained
access
to
good
society
he
boarded
in
the
same
house
with
a
virginian
who
had
a
pretty
face
very
little
sense
but
a
large
fortune
kent
with
very
little
difficulty
persuaded
her
he
was
a
saint
ready
to
be
translated
at
the
shortest
notice
he
dropped
his
abolition
notions
and
they
were
married
at
the
time
that
my
story
opens
he
is
a
planter
living
near
weston
and
we
will
hear
of
him
again
chapter
vi
arthur
weston
is
in
his
in
that
city
new
haven
he
is
in
the
act
of
replacing
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
after
having
knocked
the
ashes
off
it
when
we
introduce
to
him
the
reader
though
not
well
employed
his
first
appearance
must
be
prepossessing
he
inherited
his
mother
clear
brunette
complexion
and
her
fine
expressive
eyes
his
very
black
hair
he
had
thrown
entirely
off
his
forehead
and
he
is
now
reading
an
abolition
paper
which
had
fallen
into
his
hands
there
are
two
other
young
men
in
the
room
one
of
them
arthur
friend
abel
johnson
and
the
other
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
hubbard
who
brought
this
paper
into
my
room
said
arthur
after
laying
it
down
on
the
table
beside
him
i
was
reading
it
said
hubbard
and
threw
it
aside
well
if
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
hubbard
i
prefer
not
seeing
any
more
of
these
publications
about
me
this
number
is
a
literary
curiosity
and
deserves
to
be
preserved
but
as
i
do
not
file
papers
at
present
i
will
just
return
it
after
expressing
my
thanks
to
you
for
affording
me
the
means
of
obtaining
valuable
information
about
the
southern
country
what
is
it
about
arthur
said
abel
johnson
it
is
too
hot
to
read
this
morning
so
pray
enlighten
me
why
here
said
arthur
opening
the
paper
again
here
is
an
advertisement
said
to
be
copied
from
a
southern
paper
in
which
after
describing
a
runaway
slave
it
says
will
give
four
hundred
dollars
for
him
alive
and
the
same
sum
for
satisfactory
proof
that
he
has
been
killed
then
the
editor
goes
on
to
say
when
a
planter
loses
a
slave
he
becomes
so
impatient
at
not
capturing
him
and
is
so
angry
at
the
loss
that
he
then
does
what
is
equivalent
to
inducing
some
person
to
murder
him
by
way
of
revenge
now
is
not
this
infamous
but
it
is
true
i
believe
said
hubbard
it
is
not
true
sir
said
arthur
it
is
false
totally
and
entirely
false
why
sir
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
life
of
a
slave
is
in
the
power
of
a
master
and
that
he
is
not
under
the
protection
of
our
laws
i
am
told
that
is
the
case
said
hubbard
then
you
are
told
what
is
not
true
and
it
seems
to
me
you
are
remarkably
ignorant
of
the
laws
of
your
country
it
is
not
my
country
said
hubbard
i
assure
you
i
lay
no
claims
to
that
part
of
the
united
states
where
slavery
is
allowed
then
if
it
is
not
your
country
for
what
reason
do
you
concern
yourself
so
much
about
its
affairs
because
replied
hubbard
every
individual
has
the
right
to
judge
for
himself
of
his
own
and
of
other
countries
no
not
without
proper
information
said
arthur
and
as
you
have
now
graduated
and
intend
to
be
a
lawyer
i
trust
you
will
have
consideration
enough
for
the
profession
not
to
advance
opinions
until
you
are
sufficiently
informed
to
enable
you
to
do
so
justly
every
country
must
have
its
poor
people
you
have
yours
at
the
north
for
i
see
them
we
have
ours
yours
are
white
ours
are
black
i
say
yours
are
white
i
should
except
your
free
blacks
who
are
the
most
miserable
class
of
human
beings
i
ever
saw
they
are
indolent
reckless
and
impertinent
the
poorer
classes
of
society
are
proverbially
improvident
and
yours
in
sickness
and
in
old
age
are
often
victims
of
want
and
suffering
ours
in
such
circumstances
are
kindly
cared
for
and
are
never
considered
a
burden
our
laws
are
generally
speaking
humane
and
faithfully
administered
we
have
enactments
which
not
only
protect
their
lives
but
which
compel
their
owners
to
be
moderate
in
working
them
and
to
ensure
them
proper
care
as
regards
their
food
but
said
hubbard
you
have
other
laws
which
deprive
them
of
the
most
innocent
recreations
such
as
are
not
only
necessary
for
their
happiness
but
also
for
their
health
and
if
such
laws
do
exist
said
arthur
where
is
the
cause
you
may
trace
it
to
the
interference
of
meddling
and
unprincipled
men
they
excite
the
minds
of
the
slaves
and
render
these
laws
necessary
for
the
very
protection
of
our
lives
but
without
this
interference
there
would
be
no
such
necessity
in
this
walsh
appeal
which
is
now
open
before
me
you
will
find
where
abel
left
off
reading
these
remarks
which
show
that
not
only
the
health
and
comfort
of
the
slaves
but
also
their
feelings
are
greatly
considered
master
who
would
deprive
his
negro
of
his
property
the
product
of
his
or
his
little
garden
who
would
force
him
to
work
on
holidays
or
at
night
who
would
deny
him
common
recreations
or
leave
him
without
shelter
and
provision
in
his
old
age
would
incur
the
aversion
of
the
community
and
raise
obstacles
to
the
advancement
of
his
own
interest
and
external
aims
then
said
hubbard
you
mean
to
say
he
is
kind
from
alone
no
i
do
not
replied
arthur
that
undoubtedly
actuates
men
at
the
south
as
it
does
men
at
the
north
but
i
mean
to
say
so
universal
is
it
with
us
to
see
our
slaves
well
treated
that
when
an
instance
of
the
contrary
nature
occurs
the
author
of
it
is
subject
to
the
dislike
and
odium
of
his
acquaintances
but
said
hubbard
that
does
not
always
protect
the
slaves
which
shows
that
your
laws
are
sometimes
ineffectual
they
are
not
always
secure
from
but
do
your
laws
always
secure
you
from
said
arthur
of
course
said
hubbard
the
poorest
person
in
new
england
is
as
safe
from
injustice
and
oppression
as
the
highest
in
the
land
nonsense
said
arthur
do
you
think
i
can
judge
for
myself
as
regards
that
abel
do
tell
hubbard
of
our
little
adventure
in
the
bakehouse
with
pleasure
said
abel
especially
as
you
two
have
not
let
me
say
a
word
yet
well
hubbard
arthur
and
i
having
nothing
else
to
do
got
hungry
and
as
it
was
a
fine
evening
thought
we
would
walk
out
in
search
of
something
to
satisfy
our
appetites
and
there
being
a
pretty
girl
in
brown
bakehouse
who
waits
on
customers
we
took
that
direction
arthur
you
know
is
engaged
to
be
married
and
has
no
excuse
for
such
things
but
i
having
no
such
ties
am
free
to
search
for
pretty
faces
and
to
make
the
most
of
it
when
i
find
them
we
walked
on
and
when
we
got
to
the
shop
there
stood
brown
behind
the
counter
big
as
all
out
doors
with
a
very
red
face
and
in
a
violent
perspiration
there
was
some
thing
wrong
with
the
old
lady
was
easy
to
see
brown
said
arthur
for
i
was
looking
in
the
glass
cases
and
under
the
counter
for
the
pretty
face
you
any
rusk
sir
we
have
rusk
said
brown
tartly
you
give
us
some
and
some
cakes
or
whatever
you
have
and
then
we
will
go
and
get
some
soda
water
abel
brown
fussed
about
like
a
with
a
sore
head
and
at
last
she
broke
out
against
on
earth
has
she
put
that
cake
said
she
sent
her
in
here
with
it
an
hour
ago
just
like
her
lazy
irish
thing
they
nothing
but
white
niggers
after
all
these
irish
here
ann
she
bawled
out
here
said
ann
from
within
the
glass
door
this
minute
said
the
old
woman
and
ann
pretty
irish
face
showed
itself
immediately
that
cake
i
told
you
to
bring
here
did
tell
me
to
bring
no
cake
here
brown
said
ann
did
you
little
liar
you
said
brown
irish
are
born
liars
go
bring
it
here
ann
disappeared
and
soon
returned
looking
triumphant
brown
says
he
brought
it
in
when
you
told
him
and
covered
it
in
that
box
so
i
aint
such
a
liar
after
all
are
said
brown
a
thief
too
ann
irish
blood
was
up
neither
said
she
i
an
orphan
and
poor
that
why
scolded
and
cuffed
about
brown
blood
was
up
too
and
she
struck
the
poor
girl
in
the
face
and
her
big
hard
hand
was
in
an
instant
covered
with
blood
which
spouted
out
from
ann
nose
take
that
for
your
impudence
and
you
get
worse
next
time
you
go
disputing
with
me
declare
brown
said
arthur
is
i
thought
a
free
country
i
did
not
know
you
could
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
in
that
style
gal
the
bother
of
my
life
said
brown
brown
he
was
in
new
york
when
a
ship
come
and
that
gal
father
and
mother
must
die
of
the
and
the
gal
was
left
and
brown
calculated
she
could
be
made
to
save
us
hiring
by
teaching
her
a
little
she
smart
enough
but
she
the
obstinatest
thing
i
ever
see
i
ca
make
nothin
of
her
you
might
as
well
try
to
draw
blood
out
of
a
turnip
as
to
get
any
good
out
of
her
got
some
good
blood
out
of
her
said
i
any
rate
for
brown
was
wiping
her
hands
and
the
blood
looked
red
and
healthy
enough
she
is
not
a
turnip
that
one
thing
to
be
considered
brown
good
evening
said
arthur
shall
tell
them
at
the
south
how
you
northern
people
treat
your
white
niggers
wish
to
the
lord
said
brown
had
some
real
niggers
here
i
am
sweatin
and
workin
and
bakin
all
these
hot
days
and
brown
he
doin
nothin
from
morning
night
but
reading
abolition
papers
and
tendin
abolition
meetings
i
not
much
better
than
a
nigger
myself
half
the
time
now
said
arthur
hubbard
i
have
been
fortunate
in
my
experience
i
have
never
seen
a
slave
woman
struck
in
my
life
though
i
no
doubt
such
things
are
done
and
i
assure
you
when
i
saw
brown
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
that
pretty
face
for
life
i
wondered
your
laws
did
not
protect
bound
gals
or
niggers
as
she
calls
them
you
see
hubbard
said
abel
your
philanthropy
and
arthur
is
very
contracted
he
only
feels
sympathy
for
a
pretty
white
face
you
for
a
black
one
while
my
enlarged
benevolence
induces
me
to
stand
up
for
all
female
especially
for
the
hottentot
and
the
madagascar
ones
and
the
fair
sex
of
all
the
undiscovered
islands
on
the
globe
in
general
you
do
think
then
said
hubbard
argumentatively
that
curse
is
on
slavery
do
you
in
what
sense
asked
arthur
i
think
that
slavery
is
and
always
was
a
curse
and
that
the
creator
intended
what
he
said
when
he
first
spoke
of
it
through
noah
but
i
mean
said
hubbard
that
it
will
bring
a
curse
on
those
who
own
slaves
no
said
arthur
god
blessing
is
and
always
has
been
on
my
father
who
is
a
slaveholder
on
his
father
who
was
one
and
on
a
good
many
more
i
could
mention
in
fact
i
could
bring
forward
quite
a
respectable
list
who
have
died
in
their
beds
in
spite
of
their
egregious
sin
in
this
respect
there
are
washington
jefferson
madison
marshall
calhoun
henry
clay
and
not
a
few
others
in
this
case
the
north
as
has
been
said
says
to
her
sister
south
aside
for
i
am
holier
than
thou
that
is
you
did
need
them
and
got
rid
of
them
we
were
all
born
free
and
equal
said
hubbard
impressively
equal
said
abel
there
is
that
idiot
with
his
tongue
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
across
the
street
was
he
born
equal
with
you
it
strikes
me
said
arthur
that
our
slaves
are
not
born
free
they
ought
to
be
so
then
said
hubbard
ah
there
you
arraign
the
creator
said
arthur
i
must
stop
now
what
do
you
think
is
the
meaning
of
the
text
be
canaan
a
servant
of
servants
shall
he
be
unto
his
brethren
hubbard
said
abel
i
do
think
it
justifies
slavery
said
hubbard
well
what
does
it
mean
said
abel
it
must
mean
something
now
i
am
at
present
between
two
doctrines
so
i
am
neither
on
your
nor
on
side
if
i
ca
live
one
way
i
must
another
and
these
are
hard
times
if
i
ca
distinguish
myself
in
law
divinity
or
physic
or
as
an
artist
which
i
would
prefer
i
may
turn
planter
or
may
turn
abolition
agent
i
must
do
something
for
my
living
having
no
slaves
i
ca
turn
planter
therefore
there
is
more
probability
of
my
talents
finding
their
way
to
the
abolition
ranks
so
give
me
all
the
information
you
can
on
the
subject
go
to
the
bible
said
hubbard
and
learn
your
duty
to
your
well
here
is
a
bible
my
mother
sent
here
for
arthur
and
myself
with
the
commentaries
this
is
scott
commentary
where
is
canaan
said
he
turning
over
the
leaves
he
is
very
hard
to
be
got
at
you
are
too
far
over
said
arthur
laughing
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
referring
to
scott
here
it
is
said
abel
be
canaan
a
servant
of
servants
shall
he
be
unto
his
brethren
and
in
another
verse
we
see
shall
enlarge
japheth
and
he
shall
dwell
in
the
tents
of
shem
and
canaan
shall
be
his
servant
so
we
are
japheth
and
shem
and
the
colored
population
are
canaan
is
that
it
arthur
said
abel
see
what
scott
says
abel
said
arthur
i
not
a
commentator
well
here
it
is
is
no
authority
for
altering
the
text
and
reading
as
some
do
cursed
be
ham
the
father
of
canaan
yet
the
frequent
mention
of
ham
as
the
father
of
canaan
suggests
the
thought
that
the
latter
was
also
criminal
ham
is
thought
to
be
second
and
not
the
youngest
son
of
noah
and
if
so
the
words
what
his
younger
son
had
done
refers
to
canaan
his
grandson
ham
must
have
felt
it
a
very
mortifying
rebuke
when
his
own
father
was
inspired
on
this
occasion
to
predict
the
durable
oppression
and
slavery
of
his
posterity
canaan
was
also
rebuked
by
learning
that
the
curse
would
especially
rest
on
that
branch
of
the
family
which
should
descend
from
him
for
his
posterity
were
no
doubt
principally
though
not
exclusively
intended
now
continued
abel
i
shall
have
to
turn
planter
and
get
my
niggers
as
i
can
for
i
be
hanged
if
it
was
a
curse
and
a
predicted
one
too
that
does
not
make
it
right
said
hubbard
do
it
said
abel
well
if
it
should
be
fated
for
me
to
turn
parson
i
sha
study
divinity
with
you
for
my
mother
has
told
me
often
that
god
prophecies
were
right
and
were
fulfilled
too
as
i
think
this
one
has
been
i
suppose
then
you
think
slavery
will
always
continue
mr
weston
said
hubbard
well
i
am
only
a
man
and
can
not
prophesy
but
i
think
probably
not
slavery
is
decreasing
throughout
the
world
the
slave
trade
is
about
being
abolished
on
the
coast
of
africa
you
abolitionists
are
getting
a
good
many
off
from
our
southern
country
and
our
planters
are
setting
a
number
of
theirs
free
and
sending
them
to
africa
i
know
a
gentleman
in
georgia
who
liberated
a
number
and
gave
them
the
means
to
start
in
liberia
as
free
agents
and
men
he
told
me
he
saw
them
on
board
and
watched
the
ship
as
she
disappeared
from
his
sight
at
last
he
could
not
detect
the
smallest
trace
of
her
and
then
such
a
feeling
of
intense
satisfaction
occupied
his
breast
as
had
been
a
stranger
there
until
that
time
it
possible
that
they
are
gone
and
i
am
no
longer
to
be
plagued
with
them
they
are
free
and
i
am
free
too
he
could
hardly
give
vent
to
his
feelings
of
relief
on
the
occasion
and
are
they
such
trouble
to
you
arthur
asked
abel
no
indeed
said
arthur
not
the
least
my
father
treats
them
well
and
they
appear
to
be
as
well
off
as
the
working
classes
generally
are
i
see
rules
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
the
master
and
slave
in
scripture
but
i
see
no
where
the
injunction
to
release
them
nor
do
i
find
laid
down
the
sin
of
holding
them
the
fact
is
you
northern
people
are
full
of
your
isms
you
must
start
a
new
one
every
year
i
hope
they
will
not
travel
south
for
i
am
tired
of
them
i
should
like
to
take
deacon
and
white
back
home
with
me
our
servants
would
be
afraid
of
a
man
who
has
worked
sixteen
hours
a
day
half
his
lifetime
deacon
white
is
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
said
abel
every
cent
of
which
he
made
mending
and
making
common
shoes
what
does
he
do
with
it
said
arthur
hoards
it
up
said
abel
and
yet
an
honester
man
never
lived
did
i
not
tell
you
of
the
time
i
hired
his
horse
and
chaise
i
believe
not
well
it
is
worth
waiting
for
the
deacon
old
white
horse
is
as
gray
and
as
docile
as
himself
the
fact
is
the
stable
is
so
near
the
house
that
the
horse
is
constantly
under
the
influence
of
hundred
he
has
heard
the
good
old
tune
so
often
that
he
has
a
solemn
way
of
viewing
things
two
or
three
weeks
ago
i
wanted
to
take
my
sister
to
see
a
relative
of
ours
who
lives
seven
or
eight
miles
from
here
and
my
mother
would
not
consent
to
my
driving
her
unless
i
hired
the
deacon
horse
and
chaise
the
horse
she
said
could
not
run
if
he
wanted
to
so
i
got
him
and
harriet
asked
kate
laune
to
go
too
as
the
chaise
was
large
enough
for
all
three
and
we
had
a
good
time
we
were
gone
all
day
and
after
i
took
the
girls
home
i
drove
round
to
the
deacon
house
and
jumped
out
of
the
chaise
to
pay
what
i
owed
you
know
what
a
little
fellow
the
deacon
is
and
he
looked
particularly
small
that
evening
for
he
was
seated
in
his
reading
a
large
newspaper
which
hid
him
all
but
his
legs
these
are
so
shrunken
that
i
wonder
how
his
wife
gets
his
stockings
small
enough
for
him
evening
white
said
i
for
the
old
lady
was
sitting
on
the
steps
knitting
sake
deacon
said
she
down
your
newspaper
do
you
see
mr
johnson
deacon
did
not
even
give
me
a
nod
until
he
had
scrutinized
the
condition
of
the
horse
and
chaise
and
then
he
said
are
you
a
screw
loose
in
me
or
the
horse
and
chaise
either
for
i
had
two
girls
with
me
and
i
courting
one
of
them
for
a
quarter
so
i
drove
very
carefully
i
am
in
a
hurry
now
tell
me
what
i
am
to
pay
you
and
a
half
cents
said
the
deacon
slowly
raising
his
spectacles
from
his
nose
said
i
and
a
half
cents
why
i
have
had
the
horse
all
day
is
my
price
said
the
deacon
a
horse
and
chaise
all
day
said
i
deacon
do
charge
me
something
that
i
aint
ashamed
to
pay
you
is
my
regular
price
and
i
ca
charge
you
any
more
i
remonstrated
with
him
and
tried
to
persuade
him
to
take
cents
but
no
i
appealed
to
white
she
said
the
had
ought
to
take
more
than
the
horse
and
chaise
was
worth
however
i
induced
him
to
take
eighteen
and
cents
but
he
was
uneasy
about
it
and
said
he
was
afraid
he
was
imposing
on
me
the
next
morning
i
was
awakened
at
there
was
a
man
they
said
who
wanted
to
see
me
on
pressing
business
and
could
not
wait
i
dressed
in
a
hurry
wondering
what
was
the
cause
of
the
demand
for
i
went
down
and
there
stood
the
deacon
looking
as
if
his
last
hour
were
come
abel
he
said
have
passed
a
dreadful
restless
night
and
i
could
stand
it
after
the
day
broke
here
your
six
and
a
quarter
cents
i
had
ought
to
have
charged
you
more
than
my
usual
price
i
was
angry
at
the
old
fellow
for
waking
me
up
but
i
could
not
help
laughing
too
very
ugly
of
you
abel
to
persuade
me
to
take
so
much
said
he
welcome
to
the
horse
and
chaise
whenever
you
want
it
but
twelve
and
a
half
cents
is
my
usual
price
now
said
hubbard
he
is
like
the
portuguese
devils
when
they
are
good
they
are
too
good
i
should
distrust
that
man
he
is
close
to
a
farthing
said
abel
but
he
is
as
honest
as
the
day
why
he
has
the
reputation
of
a
saint
harriet
says
she
wishes
he
wore
a
coat
instead
of
a
short
jacket
so
that
she
could
hang
on
and
get
to
heaven
that
way
my
sister
saw
white
not
long
ago
and
complimented
her
on
her
new
bonnet
being
so
very
becoming
to
her
i
want
to
know
said
white
i
thought
it
made
me
look
like
a
fright
what
made
you
get
a
black
one
said
harriet
did
you
not
get
a
dark
green
or
a
brown
one
you
see
said
white
deacon
health
is
a
failin
dreadful
low
in
the
top
knots
lately
and
i
thought
as
his
time
might
come
very
soon
i
might
as
well
get
a
black
one
while
i
was
a
getting
we
all
born
to
die
miss
harriet
and
the
deacon
is
dwindlin
away
the
young
men
laughed
and
arthur
said
what
will
he
do
with
his
money
white
will
not
wear
the
black
bonnet
long
if
she
have
twenty
thousand
dollars
she
can
buy
a
new
bonnet
and
a
new
husband
with
that
no
danger
said
abel
deacon
white
has
made
his
will
and
has
left
his
wife
the
interest
of
five
thousand
dollars
at
her
death
the
principal
goes
as
all
the
rest
to
aid
some
benevolent
purpose
but
there
are
the
letters
what
a
bundle
for
you
arthur
that
is
the
penalty
of
being
engaged
well
i
must
wait
for
the
widow
white
i
guess
she
let
me
have
the
use
of
the
horse
and
chaise
at
any
rate
hubbard
arose
to
go
and
arthur
handed
him
his
newspaper
that
is
a
valuable
document
sir
but
there
is
one
still
more
so
in
your
library
here
it
is
a
paper
published
the
same
month
and
year
of
the
declaration
of
independence
in
which
are
advertised
in
the
new
england
states
negroes
for
sale
your
fathers
did
not
think
we
were
all
born
free
and
equal
it
appears
we
have
better
views
said
hubbard
the
rev
has
just
returned
from
a
tour
in
the
southern
states
and
he
is
to
lecture
wo
you
go
and
hear
him
thank
you
no
said
arthur
i
have
seen
some
of
this
reverend
gentleman
statements
and
his
friends
ought
to
advise
him
to
drop
the
reverend
for
life
he
is
a
fit
subject
for
an
asylum
for
i
ca
think
a
man
in
his
senses
would
lie
so
he
is
considered
a
man
of
veracity
said
hubbard
by
those
who
have
an
opportunity
of
knowing
his
character
well
i
differ
from
them
said
arthur
and
shall
deprive
myself
of
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
good
evening
sir
would
he
be
a
good
subject
for
tar
and
feathers
arthur
they
stick
like
grim
death
to
a
dead
nigger
said
abel
he
is
really
such
a
fool
said
arthur
that
i
have
no
patience
with
him
but
you
take
your
usual
nap
and
i
will
read
my
letters
chapter
vii
we
will
go
back
to
the
last
evening
at
exeter
when
we
left
weston
to
witness
the
result
of
bacchus
attendance
at
the
barbecue
there
were
other
hearts
busy
in
the
quiet
night
time
alice
resisting
the
offers
of
her
maid
to
assist
her
in
undressing
threw
herself
on
a
lounge
by
the
open
window
the
night
air
played
with
the
curtains
and
lifted
the
curls
from
her
brow
her
bloom
which
of
late
had
been
changeful
and
delicate
had
now
left
her
cheek
and
languid
and
depressed
she
abandoned
herself
to
thought
so
absorbed
was
she
that
she
was
not
aware
any
one
had
entered
the
room
until
her
mother
stood
near
gently
reproving
her
for
thus
exposing
herself
to
the
night
air
do
get
up
and
go
to
bed
she
said
where
is
martha
i
did
not
want
her
said
alice
and
am
now
going
to
bed
myself
what
has
brought
you
here
because
i
felt
anxious
about
you
said
weston
and
came
as
i
have
often
before
to
be
assured
that
you
were
well
and
enjoying
repose
i
find
you
still
up
and
now
my
daughter
there
is
a
question
i
have
feared
to
ask
you
but
can
no
longer
delay
it
by
all
the
love
that
is
between
us
by
the
tie
that
should
bind
an
only
child
to
a
widowed
mother
will
you
tell
me
what
are
the
thoughts
that
are
oppressing
you
i
have
been
anxious
for
your
health
but
is
there
not
more
cause
to
fear
for
your
happiness
i
am
well
enough
dear
mother
said
alice
with
some
irritation
of
manner
do
not
concern
yourself
about
me
if
you
will
go
to
bed
i
will
too
you
can
not
thus
put
me
off
said
weston
alice
i
charge
you
as
in
the
presence
of
god
to
tell
me
truly
do
you
love
walter
lee
it
would
be
strange
if
i
did
not
said
alice
in
a
low
voice
have
we
not
always
been
as
brother
and
sister
not
in
that
sense
alice
do
not
thus
evade
me
do
you
love
him
with
an
affection
which
should
belong
to
your
cousin
to
whom
you
are
solemnly
engaged
who
has
been
the
companion
of
your
childhood
and
who
is
the
son
of
the
best
friend
that
god
ever
raised
up
to
a
widow
and
a
fatherless
child
alice
turned
her
head
away
and
after
a
moment
answered
yes
i
do
mother
and
i
can
not
help
it
but
on
turning
to
look
at
her
mother
she
was
shocked
at
the
expression
of
agony
displayed
on
her
countenance
her
hand
was
pressed
tightly
over
her
heart
her
lips
quivered
and
her
whole
person
trembled
it
was
dreadful
to
see
her
thus
agitated
and
alice
throwing
her
arms
around
her
mother
exclaimed
what
is
it
dearest
mother
be
not
look
so
deathlike
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
oh
they
speak
falsely
who
say
the
certainty
of
evil
can
be
better
borne
than
suspense
watcher
by
the
couch
of
suffering
sayest
thou
so
now
thou
knowest
there
is
no
hope
thy
darling
must
be
given
up
there
is
no
mistaking
that
failing
pulse
and
that
eye
a
few
hours
ago
there
was
suspense
but
there
was
hope
death
was
feared
but
not
expected
his
arm
was
outstretched
but
the
blow
was
not
descending
now
there
is
no
hope
weston
had
long
feared
that
all
was
not
well
with
alice
that
while
her
promise
was
given
to
one
her
heart
had
wandered
to
another
yet
she
dreaded
to
meet
the
appalling
certainty
now
with
her
there
is
no
hope
the
keen
anguish
with
which
she
contended
was
evident
to
her
daughter
who
was
affrighted
at
her
mother
appearance
so
much
so
that
for
the
first
time
for
months
she
entirely
forgot
the
secret
she
had
been
hiding
in
her
heart
the
young
in
their
first
sorrow
dream
there
are
none
like
their
own
it
is
not
until
time
and
many
cares
have
bowed
us
to
the
earth
that
we
look
around
beholding
those
who
have
suffered
more
deeply
than
ourselves
accustomed
to
weston
was
not
long
in
recovering
herself
taking
her
daughter
hand
within
her
own
and
looking
up
in
her
fair
face
alice
she
said
you
listened
with
an
unusual
interest
to
the
details
of
suffering
of
one
whom
you
never
saw
i
mean
walter
lee
mother
she
died
i
can
tell
you
of
one
who
has
suffered
and
lived
it
is
late
and
i
fear
to
detain
you
from
your
rest
but
something
impels
me
that
i
can
not
resist
listen
then
while
i
talk
to
you
of
myself
you
are
as
yet
almost
unacquainted
with
your
mother
history
another
time
mother
you
are
not
well
now
said
alice
yes
my
love
now
you
were
born
in
the
same
house
that
i
was
yet
your
infancy
only
was
passed
where
i
lived
until
my
marriage
i
was
motherless
at
an
early
age
indeed
one
of
the
first
remembrances
that
i
recall
is
the
bright
and
glowing
summer
evening
when
my
mother
was
carried
from
our
plantation
on
james
river
to
the
opposite
shore
where
was
our
family
can
i
ever
forget
my
father
uncontrolled
grief
and
the
sorrow
of
the
servants
as
they
followed
dressed
in
the
deepest
mourning
i
was
terrified
at
the
solemn
and
bier
the
black
plumes
that
waved
over
it
and
all
the
dread
accompaniments
of
death
i
remember
but
little
for
years
after
this
save
the
continued
gloom
of
my
father
and
his
constant
affection
and
indulgence
toward
me
and
occasionally
varying
our
quiet
life
by
a
visit
to
richmond
or
washington
my
father
was
a
sincere
and
practical
christian
he
was
averse
to
parting
with
me
declaring
the
only
solace
he
had
was
in
directing
my
education
and
being
assured
of
my
happiness
my
governess
was
an
accomplished
and
amiable
lady
but
she
was
too
kind
and
yielding
i
have
always
retained
the
most
grateful
remembrance
of
her
care
thus
though
surrounded
by
good
influences
i
needed
restraint
where
there
was
so
much
indulgence
i
have
sometimes
ventured
to
excuse
myself
on
the
ground
that
i
was
not
taught
that
most
necessary
of
all
lessons
the
power
of
governing
myself
the
giving
up
of
my
own
will
to
the
matured
judgment
of
others
the
part
of
my
life
that
i
wish
to
bring
before
you
now
is
the
year
previous
to
my
marriage
never
had
i
received
an
ungentle
word
from
my
father
never
in
all
my
waywardness
and
selfwill
did
he
harshly
reprove
me
he
steadily
endeavored
to
impress
on
my
mind
a
sense
of
the
constant
presence
of
god
he
would
often
say
moment
every
hour
of
our
lives
places
its
impress
on
our
condition
in
eternity
live
then
as
did
your
mother
in
a
state
of
waiting
and
preparation
for
that
account
which
we
must
all
surely
give
for
the
talents
entrusted
to
our
care
did
i
heed
his
advice
you
will
hardly
believe
me
alice
when
i
tell
you
how
i
repaid
his
tenderness
i
was
the
cause
of
his
death
it
could
never
be
mother
said
alice
weeping
when
she
saw
the
tears
forcing
their
way
down
her
mother
cheek
you
are
excited
and
distressed
now
do
not
tell
me
any
more
and
forget
what
i
told
you
weston
hardly
seemed
to
hear
her
after
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
she
proceeded
it
was
so
indeed
i
his
only
child
was
the
cause
of
his
death
i
his
cherished
and
beloved
daughter
committed
an
act
that
broke
his
heart
and
laid
the
foundation
of
sorrows
for
me
that
i
fear
will
only
end
with
my
life
alice
i
read
not
long
since
of
a
son
the
veriest
wretch
on
earth
he
was
unwilling
to
grant
his
poor
aged
father
a
subsistence
from
his
abundance
he
embittered
the
failing
years
of
his
life
by
unkindness
and
reproaches
one
day
after
an
altercation
between
them
the
son
seized
his
father
by
his
thin
white
hair
and
dragged
him
to
the
corner
of
the
street
here
the
father
in
trembling
tones
implored
his
pity
oh
stop
my
he
said
i
dragged
my
father
here
god
has
punished
me
in
your
sin
alice
can
you
not
see
the
hand
of
a
just
god
in
this
retribution
and
do
you
wonder
when
you
made
this
acknowledgment
to
me
the
agony
of
death
overcame
me
i
thought
as
i
felt
his
hand
laid
heavily
upon
me
my
punishment
was
greater
than
i
could
bear
my
sin
would
be
punished
in
your
sorrow
and
naught
but
sorrow
would
be
your
portion
as
the
wife
of
walter
lee
do
not
interrupt
me
it
is
time
we
were
asleep
but
i
shall
soon
have
finished
what
i
have
to
say
my
father
and
weston
were
friends
in
early
life
and
i
was
thrown
into
frequent
companionship
with
my
husband
from
the
time
when
we
were
very
young
his
appearance
his
talents
his
unvaried
gayety
of
disposition
won
my
regard
for
a
time
the
excess
of
dissipation
in
which
he
indulged
was
unknown
to
us
but
on
our
return
to
virginia
after
an
absence
of
some
months
in
england
it
could
no
longer
be
concealed
his
own
father
joined
with
mine
in
prohibiting
all
intercourse
between
us
for
a
time
his
family
considered
him
as
lost
to
them
and
to
himself
he
was
utterly
regardless
of
aught
save
what
contributed
to
his
own
pleasures
i
only
mention
this
to
excuse
my
father
in
your
eyes
should
you
conclude
he
was
too
harsh
in
the
course
he
insisted
i
should
pursue
he
forbade
him
the
house
and
refused
to
allow
any
correspondence
between
us
at
the
same
time
he
promised
that
if
he
would
perfectly
reform
from
the
life
he
was
leading
at
the
end
of
two
years
he
would
permit
the
marriage
i
promised
in
return
to
bind
myself
to
these
conditions
will
you
believe
it
that
seated
on
my
mother
grave
with
my
head
upon
my
kind
breast
i
vowed
that
as
i
hoped
for
heaven
i
would
never
break
my
promise
never
see
him
again
without
my
father
permission
until
the
expiration
of
this
period
and
yet
i
did
break
it
i
have
nearly
done
i
left
home
secretly
i
was
married
and
i
never
saw
my
father
face
again
the
shock
of
my
disobedience
was
too
hard
for
him
to
bear
he
died
and
in
vain
have
i
sought
a
place
of
repentance
though
i
sought
it
with
tears
i
have
suffered
much
but
though
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
your
father
threw
away
the
best
portion
of
his
life
his
death
was
not
without
hope
i
cling
to
the
trust
that
his
sins
were
washed
away
and
his
soul
made
clean
in
the
blood
of
the
saviour
then
by
the
memory
of
all
that
i
suffered
and
of
that
father
whose
features
you
bear
whose
dying
words
gave
testimony
to
my
faithfulness
and
affection
to
him
i
conjure
you
to
conquer
this
unfortunate
passion
which
if
yielded
to
will
end
in
your
unceasing
misery
there
was
little
of
my
large
fortune
left
at
your
father
death
we
have
been
almost
dependant
on
your
uncle
yet
it
has
not
been
dependance
he
is
too
generous
to
let
us
feel
that
on
your
father
he
was
all
in
all
to
him
never
leaving
him
inducing
him
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
the
future
opening
before
him
he
taught
me
where
to
look
for
comfort
and
bore
with
me
when
in
my
impatient
grief
i
refused
to
seek
it
he
took
you
then
almost
an
infant
to
his
heart
has
cherished
you
as
his
own
and
now
looks
forward
to
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
his
son
wife
will
you
so
cruelly
disappoint
him
i
will
do
whatever
you
ask
me
dear
mother
said
alice
i
will
never
see
walter
again
if
that
will
content
you
i
have
already
told
him
that
i
can
never
be
to
him
more
than
i
have
always
been
a
sister
yet
i
can
not
help
loving
him
can
not
help
loving
a
man
whose
very
birth
is
attended
with
shame
said
weston
whose
passions
are
ungovernable
who
has
already
treated
with
the
basest
ingratitude
his
kindest
friends
have
you
so
little
pride
i
will
not
reproach
you
my
darling
promise
me
you
will
never
see
walter
again
after
without
my
knowledge
i
can
trust
you
oh
give
up
forever
the
thought
of
being
his
wife
if
ever
you
have
entertained
it
time
will
show
you
the
justice
of
my
fears
and
time
will
bring
back
your
old
feelings
for
arthur
and
we
shall
be
happy
again
i
will
make
you
the
promise
said
alice
and
i
will
keep
it
but
i
will
not
deceive
arthur
ungrateful
as
i
may
appear
he
shall
know
all
he
will
then
love
some
one
more
worthy
of
him
than
i
am
let
us
leave
the
future
in
the
hands
of
an
unerring
god
my
alice
each
one
must
bear
her
burden
i
would
gladly
bear
yours
but
it
may
not
be
forget
all
this
for
a
while
let
me
sleep
by
you
alice
could
not
but
be
soothed
by
the
gentle
tone
and
dear
caress
oh
blessed
tie
uniting
mother
and
child
earth
can
not
and
heaven
will
not
break
it
chapter
viii
as
absurd
would
it
be
for
one
of
the
small
unsettled
stars
for
whose
place
and
wanderings
we
care
not
to
usurp
the
track
of
the
queen
of
night
or
of
the
god
of
day
as
for
an
unpretending
writer
to
go
over
ground
that
has
been
trodden
by
the
master
minds
of
the
age
it
was
in
the
olden
time
that
cooper
described
a
dinner
party
in
all
its
formal
but
hospitable
perfection
washington
was
a
guest
there
too
though
an
unacknowledged
one
we
can
not
introduce
him
at
exeter
yet
i
could
bring
forward
there
more
than
one
who
knew
him
well
valuing
him
not
only
as
a
member
of
society
and
a
hero
but
as
the
man
chosen
by
god
for
a
great
purpose
besides
i
would
introduce
to
my
readers
some
of
the
residents
of
l
i
would
let
them
into
the
very
heart
of
virginia
life
and
although
i
can
not
arrogate
to
it
any
claims
for
superiority
over
other
conditions
of
society
among
people
of
the
same
class
in
life
yet
at
least
i
will
not
allow
an
inferiority
as
variety
is
the
spice
of
society
i
will
show
them
that
here
are
many
men
of
many
minds
mark
was
a
famous
waiter
almost
equal
to
bacchus
who
was
head
man
on
such
occasions
they
were
in
their
elements
at
a
dinner
party
and
the
sideboard
and
tables
on
such
an
occasion
were
in
their
holiday
attire
a
strong
arm
a
hard
brush
and
plenty
of
beeswax
banished
all
appearance
of
use
and
the
old
servants
thought
that
every
article
in
the
room
looked
as
bright
and
handsome
as
on
the
occasion
of
their
young
mistress
first
presiding
at
her
table
the
blinds
of
the
windows
looking
south
were
partly
open
the
branches
of
the
and
the
tendrils
of
the
assisted
in
shading
the
apartment
making
it
fragrant
too
the
were
hung
among
the
branches
of
the
flowers
and
the
little
prisoners
sang
as
if
they
had
at
last
found
a
way
of
escape
to
their
native
woods
silver
glittered
on
the
sideboard
the
large
china
maintaining
its
position
in
the
centre
william
had
gone
to
the
to
announce
the
important
intelligence
dinner
is
ready
and
bacchus
looked
around
the
room
for
the
last
time
to
see
that
every
thing
was
as
it
should
be
snuffing
up
the
rich
fumes
of
the
soup
as
it
escaped
from
the
sides
of
the
tureen
he
perceived
that
one
of
the
was
rather
near
the
corner
of
the
table
and
had
only
time
to
rearrange
it
when
william
threw
open
the
doors
the
company
entered
and
with
some
delay
and
formality
took
their
places
we
need
not
wait
until
the
rev
aldie
says
grace
though
that
would
not
detain
us
long
for
the
rev
aldie
besides
being
very
hungry
has
a
great
deal
of
tact
and
believes
in
short
prayers
nor
will
we
delay
to
witness
the
breaking
down
of
the
strongholds
of
precision
and
ultra
propriety
that
almost
always
solemnizes
the
commencement
of
an
entertainment
but
the
old
madeira
having
been
passed
around
we
will
listen
to
the
conversation
that
is
going
on
from
different
parts
of
the
table
we
have
outlived
sir
said
chapman
addressing
a
northern
gentleman
present
we
have
outlived
the
first
and
greatest
era
of
our
country
its
infancy
was
its
greatest
era
the
spirit
of
washington
still
breathes
among
us
one
or
two
of
us
here
have
conversed
with
him
sat
at
his
table
taken
him
by
the
hand
it
is
too
soon
for
the
great
principles
that
animated
his
whole
career
to
have
passed
from
our
memory
i
am
not
a
very
old
man
gentlemen
and
ladies
yet
it
seems
to
me
a
great
while
since
the
day
of
washington
funeral
my
father
called
me
and
my
brothers
to
him
and
while
our
mother
was
fastening
a
band
of
black
crape
around
our
hats
boys
said
he
have
seen
the
best
days
of
this
republic
it
is
so
for
as
much
as
the
united
states
has
increased
in
size
and
power
and
wealth
since
then
different
interests
are
dividing
her
was
washington
a
cheerful
man
asked
an
english
gentleman
who
was
present
i
have
heard
that
he
never
laughed
is
it
so
miss
janet
who
was
considered
a
kind
of
oracle
when
personal
memories
of
washington
were
concerned
answered
after
a
moment
pause
i
have
seen
him
smile
often
i
never
saw
him
laugh
but
once
he
rode
over
one
afternoon
to
see
a
relative
with
whom
i
was
staying
it
was
a
dark
cloudy
day
in
november
a
brisk
wood
fire
was
very
agreeable
after
some
little
conversation
on
ordinary
topics
the
gentlemen
discussed
the
politics
of
the
times
washington
saying
little
but
listening
attentively
to
others
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
son
of
my
relative
entered
in
a
noisy
bustling
manner
passing
the
gentlemen
with
a
nod
he
turned
his
back
to
the
fire
putting
his
hands
behind
him
said
he
scarcely
waiting
until
the
sentence
that
general
washington
was
uttering
was
finished
do
you
think
uncle
jack
and
i
shot
a
duck
in
the
head
he
deserved
a
reproof
for
his
forwardness
but
washington
joined
the
rest
in
a
laugh
no
doubt
amused
at
the
estimation
in
which
the
youth
held
himself
and
uncle
jack
the
two
together
killed
a
duck
and
the
boy
was
boasting
of
it
in
the
presence
of
the
greatest
man
the
world
ever
produced
the
poor
fellow
left
the
room
and
for
a
time
his
sporting
talents
were
joked
about
more
than
he
liked
after
the
ladies
retired
selden
proposed
the
health
of
the
amiable
george
washington
good
heavens
sir
said
chapman
the
veins
in
his
temples
swelling
and
his
whole
frame
glowing
with
vexation
what
is
that
you
say
did
ever
any
one
hear
of
a
soldier
being
amiable
no
sir
i
will
give
you
a
toast
that
was
drank
just
before
the
death
of
the
greatest
and
best
of
men
i
picked
up
an
old
newspaper
and
laid
it
aside
in
my
secretary
in
it
i
read
a
toast
worth
giving
fill
high
gentlemen
man
who
forgets
the
services
of
george
washington
may
he
be
forgotten
by
his
country
and
his
god
selden
who
possessed
in
a
remarkable
degree
the
amiableness
that
he
had
ascribed
to
another
swallowed
the
wine
and
approved
the
toast
chapman
was
some
time
recovering
his
composure
you
intend
to
leave
virginia
very
soon
lee
said
kent
addressing
walter
very
soon
sir
walter
replied
where
shall
you
go
first
asked
kent
i
have
not
decided
on
any
course
of
travel
said
walter
i
shall
perhaps
wander
toward
germany
we
will
drink
your
health
then
said
weston
a
pleasant
tour
walter
and
a
safe
return
you
are
from
connecticut
i
believe
mr
perkins
said
barbour
but
as
you
are
not
an
abolitionist
i
suppose
it
will
not
be
uncourteous
to
discuss
the
subject
before
you
i
have
in
my
memorandum
book
a
copy
of
a
law
of
your
state
which
was
in
existence
at
one
time
and
which
refers
to
what
we
have
been
conversing
about
it
supports
the
fugitive
slave
law
in
prospect
at
that
time
you
new
englanders
held
not
only
negro
but
indian
slaves
let
me
read
this
gentleman
it
enacted
by
the
governor
council
and
representatives
in
general
court
assembled
and
by
the
authority
of
the
same
that
whatsoever
negro
mulatto
or
indian
servant
or
servants
shall
be
wandering
out
of
the
bounds
of
the
town
or
place
to
which
they
belong
without
a
ticket
or
pass
in
writing
under
the
hand
of
some
assistant
or
justice
of
the
peace
or
under
the
hand
of
the
master
or
owner
of
such
negro
mulatto
or
indian
servant
or
servants
shall
be
deemed
and
accounted
as
runaways
and
may
be
treated
as
such
and
every
person
inhabiting
in
this
colony
finding
or
meeting
with
any
such
negro
mulatto
or
indian
servant
or
servants
not
having
a
ticket
as
aforesaid
is
hereby
empowered
to
seize
and
secure
him
or
them
and
bring
him
or
them
before
the
next
authority
to
be
examined
and
returned
to
his
or
their
master
or
owner
who
shall
satisfy
the
charge
accruing
thereby
all
ferrymen
within
the
colony
are
hereby
requested
not
to
suffer
any
indian
mulatto
or
negro
servant
without
certificate
as
aforesaid
to
pass
over
their
respective
ferries
by
assisting
them
directly
or
indirectly
on
the
penalty
of
paying
a
fine
of
twenty
shillings
for
every
such
offence
to
the
owner
of
such
servants
in
the
same
act
continued
barbour
a
free
person
who
receives
any
property
large
or
small
from
a
slave
without
an
order
from
his
master
must
either
make
full
restitution
or
be
openly
whipped
with
so
many
stripes
not
exceeding
twenty
now
gentlemen
said
chapman
who
was
an
impetuous
old
gentleman
do
you
see
those
yankees
were
close
enough
in
taking
care
of
their
own
slaves
and
if
they
could
have
raised
sugar
and
cotton
or
had
deemed
it
to
their
advantage
to
be
slaveholders
to
this
day
they
have
had
a
fugitive
slave
law
long
before
this
a
daniel
would
have
come
to
judgment
sooner
even
than
the
immortal
daniel
webster
wait
a
moment
my
dear
sir
said
barbour
another
paragraph
of
the
same
act
provides
if
any
negro
mulatto
or
indian
servant
or
slave
shall
be
found
abroad
from
home
in
the
night
season
after
nine
without
a
special
order
from
his
or
their
master
or
mistress
it
shall
be
lawful
for
any
person
or
persons
to
apprehend
and
secure
such
negro
mulatto
or
indian
servant
or
slave
so
offending
and
him
her
or
them
bring
before
the
next
assistant
or
justice
of
the
peace
which
authority
shall
have
full
power
to
pass
sentence
upon
such
servant
or
slave
and
order
him
her
or
them
to
be
publicly
whipped
on
the
body
not
exceeding
ten
stripes
pretty
tight
laws
you
had
sir
said
chapman
addressing
perkins
a
woman
could
be
picked
up
and
whipped
at
the
report
of
any
body
on
the
naked
body
why
sir
if
we
had
such
laws
here
it
would
be
whipping
all
the
time
provided
so
infamous
a
law
could
be
carried
into
execution
there
is
one
thing
certain
you
made
the
most
of
slavery
while
you
had
it
but
we
have
repented
of
all
our
misdeeds
said
perkins
yes
said
chapman
like
the
boy
that
stole
a
penny
and
when
he
found
it
would
buy
the
he
wanted
he
repented
and
carried
it
to
the
owner
but
you
must
remember
the
times
my
dear
sir
said
perkins
i
do
i
do
sir
said
chapman
the
very
time
that
you
had
come
for
freedom
yourself
you
kidnapped
the
noble
sons
of
the
soil
and
made
menials
of
them
i
wonder
the
ground
did
not
cry
out
against
you
now
we
have
been
left
with
the
curse
of
slavery
upon
us
for
it
is
in
some
respects
a
curse
on
the
negro
and
the
white
man
and
god
may
see
fit
to
remove
it
from
us
but
why
do
the
abolitionists
buy
our
slaves
and
send
them
to
liberia
that
would
be
against
their
principles
said
perkins
excuse
me
sir
said
chapman
but
d
n
their
principles
it
is
against
their
pockets
why
do
those
who
write
abolition
books
give
the
profits
to
purchase
some
of
these
poor
wretches
who
are
whipped
to
death
and
starved
to
death
and
given
to
the
flies
to
eat
up
and
burned
alive
then
i
would
believe
in
their
principles
or
at
least
in
their
sincerity
but
now
the
fear
is
for
their
pockets
i
am
a
poor
man
i
own
a
few
slaves
and
i
will
sell
them
to
any
northern
man
or
woman
at
for
what
i
could
get
from
a
trader
and
they
may
send
them
to
liberia
lord
sir
they
as
soon
think
of
buying
the
d
l
himself
you
must
excuse
my
strong
language
but
this
subject
irritates
me
not
long
ago
i
was
in
the
upper
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
looking
about
me
for
i
do
look
about
me
wherever
i
am
one
morning
i
got
up
early
and
walked
toward
the
new
railroad
that
they
were
constructing
in
the
neighborhood
i
chanced
to
get
to
the
spot
just
in
time
to
see
a
little
fracas
between
a
stout
burly
irishman
and
the
superintendent
of
the
party
thought
be
jasus
said
the
irishman
just
as
i
approached
near
enough
to
hear
what
was
going
on
a
man
could
see
himself
righted
in
a
free
country
to
your
work
said
the
superintendent
and
if
you
say
another
word
about
it
i
knock
you
over
it
you
knock
me
over
you
will
began
the
irishman
he
was
over
in
a
moment
the
superintendent
sir
gave
him
a
blow
between
the
eyes
with
a
fist
that
was
hard
as
iron
the
man
staggered
and
fell
i
helped
him
up
sir
and
i
reckon
he
thought
matters
might
be
worse
still
for
he
slowly
walked
off
d
free
country
he
muttered
to
me
in
a
kind
of
confidential
tone
thought
they
only
knocked
niggers
over
in
ameriky
be
me
soul
but
go
back
to
ireland
i
could
not
help
expressing
my
astonishment
to
the
superintendent
repeating
the
irishman
words
thought
only
niggers
could
be
knocked
over
in
this
country
said
the
superintendent
guess
if
you
had
to
deal
with
irishmen
you
find
yourself
obliged
to
knock
down
do
the
laws
protect
them
i
asked
why
railroads
have
to
be
made
and
have
to
be
made
the
right
way
i
aint
afraid
of
the
laws
i
think
no
more
of
knocking
an
irishman
over
sir
than
i
do
of
eating
my
dinner
one
is
as
necessary
as
the
other
now
continued
chapman
if
an
abolitionist
sees
a
slave
knocked
over
he
runs
home
to
tell
his
mammy
it
enough
to
bring
fire
and
brimstone
and
hail
and
earthquakes
on
the
whole
country
a
man
must
have
a
black
skin
or
his
sorrows
can
never
reach
the
hearts
of
these
gentlemen
they
had
better
look
about
at
home
there
is
wrong
enough
there
to
make
a
fuss
about
well
said
the
englishman
you
had
both
better
come
back
to
the
mother
country
the
beautiful
words
so
often
quoted
of
curran
may
invite
you
matter
with
what
solemnities
he
may
have
been
devoted
upon
the
altar
of
slavery
the
moment
he
touches
the
sacred
soil
of
britain
the
altar
and
the
god
sink
together
in
the
dust
and
he
stands
redeemed
regenerated
and
disenthralled
by
the
irresistible
genius
of
universal
emancipation
thank
you
sir
for
your
invitation
said
chapman
but
i
stay
in
virginia
the
old
state
is
good
enough
for
me
i
have
been
to
england
and
i
saw
some
of
your
redeemed
regenerated
disenthralled
people
i
saw
features
on
women
faces
that
haunted
me
afterward
in
my
dreams
i
saw
children
with
shrivelled
attenuated
limbs
and
countenances
that
were
old
in
misery
and
vice
such
men
women
and
children
as
dickens
and
charlotte
elizabeth
tell
about
my
little
was
recovering
from
a
severe
illness
not
long
ago
and
i
found
her
weeping
in
her
old
nurse
arms
grandpa
said
she
as
i
inquired
the
cause
of
her
distress
have
been
reading
the
little
i
wept
over
it
too
for
it
was
true
no
sir
if
i
must
see
slavery
let
me
see
it
in
its
best
form
as
it
exists
in
our
southern
country
you
are
right
sir
i
fear
said
the
englishman
well
said
perkins
i
am
glad
i
am
not
a
slaveholder
for
one
reason
i
am
sure
i
should
never
get
to
heaven
i
should
be
knocking
brains
out
from
morning
till
night
that
is
if
there
are
brains
under
all
that
mass
of
wool
why
they
are
so
slow
and
inactive
i
should
be
stumbling
over
them
all
the
time
though
from
the
specimens
i
have
seen
in
your
house
sir
i
should
say
they
made
most
agreeable
servants
my
servants
are
very
faithful
said
weston
they
have
had
great
pains
taken
with
them
i
rarely
have
any
complaints
from
the
overseer
your
overseers
that
is
the
worst
feature
in
slavery
said
perkins
why
sir
said
chapman
ready
for
another
argument
you
have
your
superintendents
at
the
north
and
they
can
knock
their
people
down
whenever
they
see
fit
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
perkins
i
had
forgotten
that
stay
a
little
while
with
us
said
chapman
as
weston
rose
to
lead
the
way
to
the
you
will
not
find
us
so
bad
as
you
think
we
may
roast
a
negro
now
and
then
when
we
have
a
barbecue
but
that
will
be
our
way
of
showing
you
hospitality
you
must
remember
we
are
only
heathenish
southerners
according
to
the
best
received
opinions
of
some
who
live
with
you
in
new
england
alice
said
weston
at
a
late
hour
in
the
evening
when
the
last
of
the
guests
were
taking
their
departure
walter
would
like
to
see
you
in
the
library
but
my
love
i
wish
you
would
spare
yourself
and
him
the
useless
pain
of
parting
i
must
see
him
dear
mother
do
not
refuse
me
it
is
for
the
last
time
pray
let
me
go
if
you
choose
and
alice
glided
away
as
her
mother
was
interrupted
by
the
of
some
of
their
visitors
the
forms
the
courtesies
of
life
had
no
claims
upon
her
now
she
was
enduring
her
first
sorrow
the
foundation
of
youth
slight
fabric
of
happiness
was
yielding
beneath
her
touch
the
dread
nevermore
that
edgar
poe
could
not
drive
from
his
heart
and
sight
was
oppressing
her
she
sought
him
before
whom
her
young
heart
had
bowed
not
the
less
devotedly
and
humbly
that
it
was
silently
and
secretly
it
was
to
be
a
bitter
parting
not
as
when
she
watched
to
the
last
arthur
weston
who
was
dear
to
her
as
ever
was
brother
to
a
sister
for
they
had
the
promise
and
hope
of
meeting
again
but
now
there
was
no
tear
in
her
eye
no
trembling
in
her
frame
and
no
hope
in
her
heart
from
the
utmost
depth
of
her
soul
arose
the
prophetic
voice
thou
shalt
see
him
no
more
alice
said
walter
taking
her
hand
between
both
of
his
and
gazing
at
her
face
as
pale
and
sad
as
his
own
it
is
your
mother
wish
that
from
this
time
we
should
be
strangers
to
each
other
even
loving
as
we
do
that
our
paths
on
earth
should
separate
never
to
meet
again
is
it
your
wish
too
we
must
part
you
know
it
walter
said
alice
musingly
looking
out
upon
but
not
seeing
the
calm
river
and
the
stars
that
gazed
upon
its
waves
and
all
the
solemn
beauty
with
which
night
had
invested
herself
but
you
love
me
alice
and
will
you
see
me
go
from
you
forever
without
hope
will
you
yourself
speak
the
word
that
sends
me
forth
a
wanderer
upon
the
earth
said
walter
what
can
i
do
said
alice
choose
alice
your
own
destiny
and
fix
mine
walter
i
can
not
leave
my
mother
i
would
die
a
thousand
times
rather
than
bring
such
sorrow
upon
her
who
has
known
so
much
my
uncle
too
my
more
than
father
oh
walter
i
have
sinned
and
i
suffer
you
are
wise
alice
you
have
chosen
well
you
cling
to
mother
and
home
and
friends
i
have
none
of
these
ties
there
is
not
upon
earth
a
being
so
utterly
friendless
as
i
am
dear
walter
you
have
friends
and
you
can
make
them
you
have
wealth
talent
and
many
gifts
from
god
go
forth
into
the
world
and
use
them
let
your
noble
heart
take
courage
and
in
assisting
others
and
making
them
happy
you
will
soon
be
happy
yourself
walter
looked
at
her
with
surprise
such
words
were
unlike
her
whom
he
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
a
loving
and
lovely
child
but
a
bitter
smile
passed
over
his
countenance
and
in
a
stern
voice
he
said
and
you
alice
what
are
you
to
do
god
alone
knows
said
alice
forced
into
a
consideration
of
her
own
sorrow
and
resting
against
a
lounge
near
which
she
had
been
standing
she
wept
bitterly
walter
did
not
attempt
to
restrain
her
but
stood
as
if
contemplating
a
grief
that
he
could
not
wish
to
control
alice
again
spoke
it
must
come
dear
walter
first
or
last
and
we
may
as
well
speak
the
farewell
which
must
be
spoken
but
i
could
endure
my
part
if
i
had
the
hope
that
you
will
be
happy
will
you
promise
me
you
will
try
to
be
no
alice
i
can
not
promise
you
that
if
happiness
were
in
our
own
power
i
would
not
be
looking
on
you
whom
i
have
loved
all
my
life
for
the
last
time
but
i
will
hope
he
continued
you
may
be
fortunate
enough
to
forget
and
be
happy
children
said
miss
janet
for
she
had
gently
approached
them
do
you
know
when
and
where
happiness
is
to
be
found
when
we
have
done
all
that
god
has
given
us
to
do
here
and
in
the
heaven
above
those
stars
that
are
now
looking
down
upon
you
look
upon
alice
walter
with
the
hope
of
meeting
again
and
until
then
let
the
remembrance
of
her
beauty
and
her
love
be
ever
about
you
let
her
hear
of
you
as
one
who
deserves
the
pure
affection
of
her
young
and
trusting
heart
you
have
lived
as
brother
and
sister
part
as
such
and
may
the
blessing
of
god
be
upon
both
of
you
forever
walter
took
alice
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
cheek
all
sternness
and
pride
had
gone
from
his
handsome
face
but
there
was
such
a
look
of
hopeless
sorrow
there
as
we
would
not
willingly
behold
on
the
countenance
of
one
so
young
cousin
janet
led
him
away
and
with
words
of
solemn
deep
affection
bade
him
farewell
words
that
came
again
for
a
time
unheeded
and
unwelcomed
words
that
at
the
last
brought
hope
and
peace
to
a
fainting
heart
cousin
janet
returned
to
alice
whose
face
lay
hidden
within
her
hands
alice
darling
she
said
look
up
god
is
here
forget
your
own
grief
and
think
of
one
who
suffered
and
who
feels
for
all
who
like
him
must
bear
the
burden
of
mortality
think
of
your
many
blessings
and
how
grateful
you
should
feel
for
them
think
of
your
mother
who
for
years
wept
as
you
i
trust
may
never
weep
think
of
your
kind
uncle
who
would
die
to
save
you
an
hour
pain
trust
the
future
with
all
its
fears
to
god
and
peace
will
come
with
the
very
effort
to
attain
it
oh
cousin
janet
said
alice
if
walter
were
not
so
lonely
he
knows
not
where
he
is
going
nor
what
he
is
going
to
do
it
is
true
said
cousin
janet
weeping
too
but
we
can
hope
and
trust
and
pray
and
now
my
love
let
us
join
your
mother
in
her
room
it
is
a
sad
parting
for
her
too
for
walter
is
dear
to
us
all
reader
have
so
many
years
passed
away
that
thou
hast
forgotten
the
bitterness
of
thy
first
sorrow
or
is
it
yet
to
come
thinkest
thou
there
is
a
way
of
escape
none
unless
thou
art
young
and
death
interpose
saving
thee
from
all
sadness
and
writing
on
thy
grave
do
not
weep
for
me
thou
knowest
not
how
much
of
sorrow
this
early
tomb
has
saved
me
when
were
thy
first
thoughts
of
death
i
do
not
mean
the
sight
of
the
coffin
the
pall
or
any
of
its
sad
accompaniments
but
the
time
when
the
mind
first
arrested
itself
with
the
melancholy
convictions
of
mortality
there
was
a
holiday
for
me
in
my
young
days
to
which
i
looked
forward
as
the
mohammedan
to
his
paradise
this
was
a
visit
to
a
where
i
revelled
in
the
breath
of
the
woodbines
and
sweetbriers
and
where
i
sat
under
tall
and
spreading
trees
and
wondered
why
towns
and
cities
were
ever
built
the
great
willows
swept
the
windows
of
the
chamber
where
i
slept
and
faces
with
faded
eyes
looked
upon
me
from
their
old
frames
by
the
moonlight
as
i
fell
asleep
after
the
day
enjoyment
i
never
tired
of
wandering
through
the
gardens
where
were
roses
and
hyacinths
and
honeysuckles
and
flowers
of
every
shape
and
hue
this
was
the
fairy
spot
of
my
recollection
for
even
childhood
has
its
cares
and
there
were
memories
of
little
griefs
which
time
has
never
chased
away
there
i
used
to
meet
two
children
who
often
roamed
through
the
near
woods
with
me
i
do
not
remember
their
ages
nor
their
names
they
were
younger
though
than
i
they
might
not
have
been
beautiful
but
i
recollect
the
bright
eyes
and
that
downy
velvet
hue
that
is
only
found
on
the
soft
check
of
infancy
summer
came
and
when
i
went
again
i
found
the
clematis
sweeping
the
garden
walks
and
the
bending
under
the
weight
of
their
own
beauty
so
we
walked
along
i
and
an
old
servant
stopping
to
enter
an
arbor
or
to
raise
the
head
of
a
drooping
plant
or
to
pluck
a
shrub
and
place
it
in
my
bosom
where
are
the
little
girls
i
asked
have
they
come
again
too
yes
they
are
here
she
said
as
we
approached
two
little
mounds
covered
over
with
the
myrtle
and
its
purple
flowers
what
is
here
child
here
are
the
little
ones
you
asked
for
oh
those
little
graves
how
wonderingly
i
gazed
upon
them
there
was
no
thought
of
death
mingled
with
my
meditation
there
was
of
quiet
and
repose
but
not
of
death
i
had
seen
no
sickness
no
suffering
and
i
only
wondered
why
those
fair
children
had
laid
down
under
the
myrtle
i
fancied
them
with
the
fringed
eyelids
drooping
over
the
cheeks
and
the
velvet
hue
still
there
how
much
did
i
know
of
death
as
little
as
of
life
time
passed
with
me
and
i
saw
the
sorrows
of
others
sometimes
i
thought
of
the
graves
and
the
children
that
slept
beneath
oh
how
quiet
they
must
be
they
utter
no
cry
they
shed
no
tears
time
passed
and
an
angel
slept
in
my
bosom
close
to
my
heart
need
i
say
that
i
was
happy
when
she
nestled
there
that
her
voice
was
music
to
my
soul
and
her
smile
the
very
presence
of
beauty
need
i
say
it
was
joy
when
she
called
me
mother
then
i
lived
for
the
present
all
the
sorrow
that
i
had
seen
around
me
was
forgotten
god
called
that
angel
to
her
native
heaven
and
i
wept
now
was
the
mystery
of
the
graves
open
before
my
sight
i
had
seen
the
going
forth
of
a
little
life
that
was
part
of
my
own
i
remembered
the
hard
sighs
that
convulsed
that
infant
breast
i
knew
that
the
grave
was
meant
to
hide
from
us
silence
and
pallor
desolation
and
decay
i
was
in
the
world
no
longer
a
garden
of
flowers
where
i
sought
from
under
the
myrtle
for
the
bright
eyes
and
the
velvet
cheeks
i
was
in
the
world
and
death
was
there
too
it
was
by
my
side
i
gave
my
darling
to
the
earth
and
felt
for
myself
the
bitterness
of
tears
thus
must
it
ever
be
by
actual
suffering
must
the
young
be
persuaded
of
the
struggle
that
is
before
them
well
is
it
when
there
is
one
to
say
god
is
here

we
have
to
do
bayard
taylor
writing
from
nubia
in
upper
egypt
says
those
friends
of
the
african
race
who
point
to
egypt
as
a
proof
of
what
that
race
has
done
are
wholly
mistaken
the
only
negro
features
represented
in
egyptian
sculpture
are
those
of
the
slaves
and
captives
taken
in
the
ethiopian
wars
of
the
pharaohs
the
temples
and
pyramids
throughout
nubia
as
far
as
abyssinia
all
bear
the
hieroglyphics
of
these
monarchs
there
is
no
evidence
in
all
the
valley
of
the
nile
that
the
negro
race
ever
attained
a
higher
degree
of
civilization
than
is
at
present
exhibited
in
congo
and
ashantee
i
mention
this
not
from
any
feeling
hostile
to
that
race
but
simply
to
controvert
an
opinion
very
prevalent
in
some
parts
of
the
united
states
it
seemed
impossible
to
know
phillis
without
feeling
for
her
sentiments
of
the
highest
respect
the
blood
of
the
freeman
and
the
slave
mingled
in
her
veins
her
mind
slowly
advanced
to
a
conclusion
but
once
made
she
rarely
changed
it
phillis
would
have
been
truly
happy
to
have
obtained
her
own
freedom
and
that
of
her
husband
and
children
she
scorned
the
idea
of
running
away
or
of
obtaining
it
otherwise
than
as
a
gift
from
her
owner
she
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
bible
and
often
pondered
on
the
words
of
the
angel
return
and
submit
thyself
to
thy
mistress
she
had
on
one
occasion
accompanied
her
master
and
weston
to
the
north
where
she
was
soon
found
out
by
some
of
that
disinterested
class
of
individuals
called
abolitionists
in
reply
to
the
question
are
you
free
there
was
but
a
moment
hesitation
her
pride
of
heart
gave
way
to
her
inherent
love
of
truth
i
tell
no
lie
she
answered
i
am
a
slave
why
do
you
not
your
freedom
was
the
rejoinder
you
are
in
a
free
state
they
can
not
force
you
to
the
south
if
you
will
take
the
offers
we
make
you
and
leave
your
master
you
are
abolitionists
i
asked
phillis
we
are
they
said
and
we
will
help
you
off
i
want
none
of
your
help
said
phillis
my
husband
and
children
are
at
home
but
if
they
was
i
am
an
honest
woman
and
am
not
in
the
habit
of
any
thing
i
never
my
freedom
if
my
master
would
give
it
to
me
and
the
rest
of
us
i
should
be
thankful
i
am
not
going
to
begin
stealing
and
i
fifty
years
of
age
an
described
the
straightening
of
her
tall
figure
and
the
indignant
flashing
of
her
eye
also
the
discomfited
looks
of
her
northern
friends
i
have
somewhere
read
of
a
fable
of
iceland
according
to
it
lost
souls
are
to
be
parched
in
the
burning
heat
of
hecla
and
then
cast
for
ever
to
cool
in
its
snows
although
phillis
could
not
have
quoted
this
her
opinions
would
have
applied
it
for
some
reason
it
was
evident
to
her
mind
for
she
had
been
well
instructed
in
the
bible
that
slavery
was
from
the
first
ordained
as
a
curse
it
might
to
her
high
spirit
have
been
like
burning
in
the
bosom
of
hecla
but
taking
refuge
among
abolitionists
was
from
the
many
instances
that
had
come
to
her
knowledge
like
cooling
in
its
snows
at
the
time
that
we
introduced
her
to
the
reader
she
was
the
mother
of
twelve
children
some
were
quite
young
but
a
number
of
them
were
grown
and
all
of
them
with
the
exception
of
one
the
namesake
of
his
father
inherited
their
mother
energy
of
character
she
had
accustomed
them
to
constant
industry
and
unqualified
obedience
to
her
directions
and
for
this
reason
no
one
had
found
it
necessary
to
interfere
in
their
management
pride
was
a
large
ingredient
in
phillis
composition
although
her
husband
presented
one
of
the
blackest
visages
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
phillis
appeared
to
hold
in
small
esteem
the
ordinary
servants
on
the
plantation
she
was
constantly
chiding
her
children
for
using
their
expressions
and
tried
to
keep
them
in
the
house
with
white
people
as
much
as
possible
that
they
might
acquire
good
manners
it
was
quite
a
grief
to
her
that
bacchus
had
not
a
more
genteel
dialect
than
the
one
he
used
she
had
a
great
deal
of
family
pride
there
was
a
difference
in
her
mind
between
family
servants
and
those
employed
in
field
labor
for
the
quality
she
had
the
highest
respect
for
poor
white
people
only
a
feeling
of
pity
she
had
some
noble
qualities
and
some
great
weaknesses
but
as
a
we
present
her
to
the
reader
and
she
must
be
viewed
as
such
miss
janet
was
in
her
eyes
perfection
her
children
were
all
the
better
for
her
kind
instructions
her
youngest
child
lydia
a
girl
of
six
or
seven
years
old
followed
the
old
lady
everywhere
carrying
her
key
and
looking
for
her
spectacles
and
maintaining
short
conversations
in
a
confidential
tone
one
of
phillis
chiefest
virtues
was
that
she
had
been
able
to
bring
bacchus
into
subjection
with
the
exception
of
his
love
for
an
occasional
spree
spoiled
by
an
indulgent
master
his
conceit
and
wilfulness
had
made
him
unpopular
with
the
servants
though
his
high
tone
of
speaking
and
a
certain
pretension
in
his
manner
and
dress
was
not
without
its
effect
he
was
a
sort
of
patriarch
among
waiters
and
could
tell
anecdotes
of
dinners
where
washington
was
a
guest
and
had
been
familiar
with
certain
titled
people
from
abroad
whose
shoes
he
had
had
the
honor
of
polishing
the
only
person
in
whose
presence
he
restrained
his
braggadocio
style
was
phillis
her
utter
contempt
for
nonsense
was
too
evident
bacchus
was
the
same
size
as
his
master
and
often
fell
heir
to
his
clothes
a
blue
and
buff
vest
that
he
thus
inherited
had
a
great
effect
upon
him
bodily
and
spiritually
not
only
did
he
swagger
more
when
arrayed
in
them
but
his
prayers
and
singing
were
doubly
effective
he
secretly
prided
himself
on
a
likeness
to
weston
but
this
must
have
been
from
a
confusion
of
mind
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
constantly
associating
himself
with
weston
coats
and
pantaloons
he
once
said
to
phillis
you
might
know
master
was
a
born
gentleman
by
de
way
his
clothes
fits
dey
do
hang
about
him
but
dey
as
if
dey
had
grow
about
him
by
degrees
and
if
you
notice
dey
fits
me
in
de
same
way
pity
i
ca
wear
his
shoes
dey
so
soft
and
dey
do
creak
i
hates
boots
and
shoes
all
time
creakin
its
so
like
poor
white
folks
when
they
get
dressed
up
on
sunday
i
wonders
often
miss

thinks
a
servant

to
wear
i
was
a
wishin

a
hard
thing

and
pushes
up
to
people
chins
i
mean
people
dat

and
i

miss
janet
up
to
gittin
one
or
two
for
me
miss
mighty
for
an
ole
maid
as
if
she
liked
to
see
even
cats
happy
when
an
ole
maid
do
hate
cats
there
aint
nothin
to
be
feared
from
phillis
ruled
her
husband
in
most
things
but
she
indulged
him
in
all
his
whims
that
were
innocent
she
determined
he
should
have
not
an
old
ruffled
shirt
but
a
new
one
she
reported
the
case
to
miss
janet
who
set
two
of
her
girls
to
work
and
by
saturday
night
the
shirt
was
made
and
done
up
and
plaited
bacchus
was
to
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
next
morning
appearing
on
the
top
of
his
chest
it
happened
that
on
this
identical
sunday
bacchus
had
as
the
best
of
men
will
sometimes
got
up
wrong
foot
foremost
and
not
having
taken
the
trouble
to
go
back
to
bed
and
get
up
again
putting
the
right
foot
out
first
he
continued
in
the
same
unhappy
state
of
mind
he
made
as
was
his
wont
a
hasty
toilet
before
breakfast
he
wore
an
old
shirt
and
a
pair
of
pantaloons
that
did
not
reach
much
above
his
hips
one
of
his
slippers
had
no
instep
the
other
was
without
a
heel
his
grizzly
beard
made
him
look
like
a
wild
man
of
the
woods
a
certain
sardonic
expression
of
countenance
contributed
to
this
effect
he
planted
his
chair
on
its
remaining
hind
leg
at
the
cabin
door
and
commenced
a
systematic
strain
of
grumbling
before
he
was
fairly
seated
in
it
i
believe
in
my
soul
phillis
heard
him
say
dat

flies
bacchus
kicked
his
slippers
off
and
stumbled
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
i
swar
said
he
after
a
glance
at
the
fried
ham
and
eggs
if
ever
a
man
had
to
eat
sich
cookin
as
dis
why
did
you
fry
a
little
more
phillis
not
minding
him
he
condescended
to
eat
them
all
and
to
do
justice
to
the
meal
in
general
the
old
fool
thought
phillis
amused
and
provoked
talkin
of
pilferin
never
mind
i
put
his
ruffled
shirt
out
and
he
get
in
a
good
humor
when
he
sees
it
i
reckon
having
finished
his
breakfast
bacchus
put
an
enormous
piece
of
tobacco
in
his
mouth
and
commenced
sharpening
a
scythe
that
he
called
a
razor
in
doing
so
he
made
a
noise
like
a
steamboat
now
and
then
breathing
on
it
and
going
in
a
severe
fit
of
coughing
with
every
extra
exertion
on
his
table
was
a
broken
piece
of
on
the
quicksilver
side
of
which
arthur
had
when
a
child
drawn
a
horse
into
this
bacchus
gave
a
look
preparatory
to
commencing
operations
then
after
due
time
spent
in
lathering
he
hewed
down
at
each
shave
an
amount
of
black
tow
that
was
inconceivable
after
he
had
done
he
gathered
up
his
traps
and
stowed
them
away
in
the
corner
of
his
chest
phillis
sat
outside
the
door
smoking
looking
in
at
the
window
occasionally
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
first
sight
of
the
new
shirt
she
saw
him
turn
toward
the
little
red
painted
bureau
on
which
she
had
laid
out
his
clean
clothes
starting
with
surprise
and
pleasure
when
his
eye
first
took
in
the
delightful
vision
cortez
when
he
stood
conqueror
of
mexico
did
not
feel
the
glow
of
satisfaction
that
thrilled
through
bacchus
heart
as
he
gently
patted
the
plaited
ruffles
and
examined
the
wristbands
which
were
stitched
with
the
utmost
neatness
he
got
weak
in
the
knees
with
pleasure
and
sat
down
on
the
chest
in
the
corner
to
support
with
more
ease
this
sudden
accession
of
happiness
while
his
wife
was
reaping
a
harvest
of
gratification
at
the
success
of
her
efforts
toward
his
peace
of
mind
all
at
once
she
saw
a
change
pass
over
his
visage
bacchus
recollected
that
it
would
not
do
for
him
so
suddenly
to
get
into
a
good
humor
besides
he
reflected
it
was
no
more
than
phillis
duty
to
make
him
ruffled
shirts
and
she
ought
to
have
been
so
doing
for
the
last
twenty
years
these
considerations
induced
him
not
to
show
much
pleasure
on
the
occasion
but
to
pretend
he
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
style
and
workmanship
of
the
article
in
question
why
lord
a
massy
said
he
phillis
what

my
soul

phillis
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
her
pipe
and
puffed
on
look
here
phillis
said
bacchus
going
to
the
door
as
fast
as
the
uncertain
condition
of
his
pantaloons
would
allow
him

was
sich
a
fool
as
to

to

chist

one
of
my
old

bacchus
went
in
and
in
due
time
made
his
appearance
in
full
dress
he
wore
the
blue
coat
and
buff
vest
and
a
pair
of
white
pantaloons
made
after
the
old
style
his
shoes
were
as
bright
as
his
eyes
and
his
hat
dusted
until
it
only
wanted
an
entire
new
nap
to
make
it
as
good
as
new
his
hair
was
combed
in
a
sort
of
mound
in
front
and
the
was
astounding
he
passed
phillis
in
a
dignified
way
as
if
she
were
a
valuable
cat
that
he
would
not
like
to
tread
upon
phillis
looked
after
him
with
a
most
determined
expression
of
face
if
she
had
been
made
out
of
stone
she
could
not
have
seemed
more
resolved
she
got
up
however
soon
after
and
went
in
to
arrange
matters
after
her
lord
and
master
bacchus
purposely
passed

her
a
stylish
bow

taken

head
her
hair
standing
off
every
which
way
appearing
determined
to
take
her
up
somewhere
the
point
of
destination
being
a
matter
of
no
consequence
she
chuckled

be
dead
and
out
of
der
way
fore
long
bacchus
prayed
with
great
effect
this
morning
calling
himself
and
the
whole
congregation
the
most
dreadful
names
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
he
made
a
short
address
too
warning
the
servants
against
sin
in
general
and
a
love
of
finery
in
particular
on
his
return
he
beamed
forth
upon
phillis
like
one
of
her
own
morning
glories
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
brimful
of
jokes
and
religion
the
next
sunday
came
around
phillis
smoked
outside
while
bacchus
made
his
toilet
phillis
said
the
old
fellow
blandly
coming
to
the
door
i
do
see
my
ruffled
shirt
out
here
high
said
phillis
i
laid
your
shirt
with
the
rest
but
i
look
here
it
is
said
she
pleasantly
jest
where
i
put
it
why
whar
the
ruffles
i
cut
off
said
phillis
you
asked
me
to
bacchus
got
weak
in
the
knees
again
and
had
to
sit
down
on
the
old
chest
not
a
word
escaped
his
lips
a
deep
sigh
burst
from
the
boiler
of
his
remorse
with
an
agonized
countenance
he
seized
a
piece
of
rag
which
he
had
used
as
a
shaving
towel
and
wiped
away
a
repentant
tear
his
soul
was
subdued
within
him
he
went
to
meeting
but
declined
officiating
in
any
capacity
pleading
a
pain
in
his
stomach
as
an
excuse
at
dinner
he
found
it
impossible
to
finish
the
remaining
quarter
of
a
very
tough
old
rooster
phillis
had
stuffed
and
roasted
for
him
at
sundown
he
ate
a
and
a
tin
pan
of
bonnyclabber
then
observing
that
he
believed
he
was
put
into
dis
world
for
nothing
but
to
have
trouble
he
took
to
his
bed
phillis
saw
that
he
would
be
more
docile
for
the
rest
of
his
life
for
a
moment
the
thought
of
restoring
the
shirt
to
its
original
splendor
occurred
to
her
but
she
chased
it
away
as
if
it
had
been
a
fox
and
took
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
having
given
the
old
fool
a
lesson
that
would
last
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
to
you
generous
and
men
and
women
of
the
south
i
appeal
i
quote
the
words
of
a
late
writer
on
abolitionism
when
i
say
is
ever
a
creature
to
be
trusted
with
wholly
irresponsible
power
can
anybody
fail
to
make
the
inference
what
the
practical
result
will
be
a
although
she
is
here
speaking
of
slavery
can
you
not
apply
it
to
matrimony
in
this
miserable
country
of
ours
can
we
not
remodel
our
husbands
place
them
under
our
thumbs
and
shut
up
the
escape
valves
of
their
grumbling
forever
to
be
sure
paul
exhorts
wives
to
be
obedient
to
their
own
husbands
and
servants
to
be
obedient
to
their
own
masters
but
paul
was
not
an
abolitionist
he
did
not
take
into
consideration
the
necessities
of
the
party
and
woman
this
is
the
era
of
mental
and
bodily
emancipation
take
advantage
of
it
wives
and
negroes
but
alas
for
the
former
there
is
no
society
formed
for
benefit
their
day
of
deliverance
has
not
yet
dawned
and
until
its
first
gleamings
arise
in
the
they
must
wear
their
chains
except
when
some
female
steps
forth
from
the
degraded
ranks
and
asserts
her
position
whether
by
giving
loose
to
that
unruly
member
the
tongue
or
by
a
piece
of
management
which
will
give
an
old
fool
a
lesson
that
will
last
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
chapter
phillis
was
at
her
ironing
early
in
the
morning
for
she
liked
to
hurry
it
over
before
the
heat
of
the
day
her
cabin
doors
were
open
and
her
flowers
which
had
been
watered
by
a
slight
rain
that
fell
about
daybreak
looked
fresh
and
beautiful
her
house
could
be
hardly
called
a
cabin
for
it
was
very
much
superior
to
the
others
on
the
plantation
though
they
were
all
comfortable
phillis
was
regarded
by
the
weston
family
as
the
most
valuable
servant
they
owned
and
apart
from
her
services
there
were
strong
reasons
why
they
were
attached
to
her
she
had
nursed
weston
in
her
last
illness
and
as
her
death
occurred
immediately
after
birth
she
nourished
him
as
her
own
child
and
loved
him
quite
as
well
her
comfort
and
wishes
were
always
objects
of
the
greatest
consideration
to
the
family
and
this
was
proved
whenever
occasion
allowed
her
neatly
cottage
was
enclosed
by
a
wooden
fence
in
good
condition
her
little
garden
laid
out
with
great
taste
if
we
except
the
rows
of
box
which
phillis
took
pride
in
a
large
willow
tree
shaded
one
side
of
it
and
on
the
other
gaudy
sunflowers
reared
their
heads
and
the
white
and
persian
lilacs
contrasted
with
them
all
kinds
of
small
flowers
and
roses
adorned
the
front
of
the
house
and
you
might
as
well
have
sought
for
a
diamond
over
the
whole
place
as
a
weed
the
back
of
the
lot
was
arranged
for
the
accommodation
of
her
pigs
and
chickens
and
two
enormous
peacocks
that
were
fond
of
sunning
themselves
by
the
front
door
were
the
handsomest
ornaments
about
the
place
the
room
in
which
phillis
ironed
was
not
encumbered
with
much
furniture
her
occupied
a
large
part
of
its
centre
and
in
the
ample
fireplace
was
blazing
a
fire
great
enough
to
cook
a
repast
for
a
moderate
number
of
giants
behind
the
back
door
stood
a
common
pine
bedstead
with
an
enormous
bed
upon
it
how
any
bedstead
held
such
a
bed
was
remarkable
for
phillis
believed
there
was
a
virtue
in
feathers
even
in
the
hottest
weather
and
she
would
rather
have
gone
to
roost
on
the
nearest
tree
than
to
have
slept
on
any
thing
else
the
quilt
was
of
a
domestic
blue
and
white
her
own
manufacture
and
the
cases
to
the
pillows
were
very
white
and
smooth
a
little
common
trundle
bedstead
was
underneath
and
on
it
was
the
bedding
which
was
used
for
the
younger
children
at
night
the
older
ones
slept
in
the
servants
wing
in
the
house
phillis
making
use
of
two
enormous
chests
which
were
bacchus
and
her
wardrobes
for
sleeping
purposes
for
a
couple
more
to
the
right
of
the
bed
was
the
small
chest
of
drawers
over
which
was
suspended
bacchus
piece
of
shaving
glass
and
underneath
it
a
pine
box
containing
his
shaving
weapons
several
chairs
in
a
disabled
state
found
places
about
the
room
and
stood
with
open
arms
ready
to
receive
the
white
and
linen
that
was
destined
to
hang
upon
it
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
was
a
small
dresser
with
plates
and
jars
of
all
sizes
and
varieties
and
over
each
were
suspended
some
branches
of
trees
inviting
the
flies
to
rest
upon
them
there
was
no
cooking
done
in
this
room
there
being
a
small
shed
for
that
purpose
back
of
the
house
not
a
spot
of
grease
dimmed
the
whiteness
of
the
floors
and
order
reigned
supreme
marvellous
to
relate
where
a
descendant
of
afric
daughters
presided
lydia
had
gone
as
usual
to
miss
janet
and
several
of
the
other
children
were
busy
about
the
yard
feeding
the
chickens
sweeping
up
and
employed
in
various
ways
the
only
one
who
ever
felt
inclined
to
be
lazy
and
who
was
in
body
and
mind
the
counterpart
of
his
father
being
seated
on
the
door
step
declaring
he
had
a
pain
in
his
foot
the
adjoining
room
was
the
place
in
which
phillis
soul
delighted
the
door
of
it
being
at
all
times
locked
and
the
key
lost
in
the
depths
of
her
capacious
pocket
from
this
place
of
retirement
it
emerged
when
any
of
the
family
honored
her
with
their
company
especially
when
attended
by
visitors
and
after
their
departure
traces
of
their
feet
were
carefully
sought
with
keen
and
anxious
eyes
and
quickly
obliterated
with
broom
and
duster
this

roomy
apartment
with
three
windows

shaded
by

cotton
curtains
on
the
floor

a
carpet
no
hand
was
employed
in
its
manufacture
save
its
owner
from
the
time
she
commenced
tearing
the
rags
in
strips
to
the
final
blow
given
to
the
last
tack
that
confined
it
to
the
floor
a
very
high
post
bedstead
over
which
were
suspended
white
cotton
curtains
gave
an
air
of
grandeur
to
one
side
of
the
room
no
one
had
slept
in
it
for
ten
years
though
it
was
made
with
faultless
precision
the
quilt
over
it
contained
pieces
of
every
calico
and
gingham
dress
that
had
been
worn
in
the
weston

since

in

among

phillis
was
ironing
away
with
a
good
heart
when
she
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
attend
her
master
in
the
library
she
obeyed
it
with
very
little
delay
and
found
weston
seated
in
his
looking
over
a
note
which
he
held
in
his
hand
come
in
phillis
he
said
in
a
kind
but
grave
manner
i
want
to
speak
with
you
for
a
few
moments
and
as
i
have
always
found
you
truthful
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
perfectly
so
on
the
present
occasion
what
is
it
master
phillis
said
respectfully
i
received
a
note
yesterday
from
dawson
about
his
servant
jim
who
ran
away
three
weeks
ago
he
charges
me
with
having
permitted
my
servants
to
shelter
him
for
the
night
on
my
plantation
having
certain
information
that
he
was
seen
leaving
it
the
morning
after
the
severe
storm
we
had
about
that
time
if
you
know
any
thing
of
it
phillis
i
require
you
to
tell
it
to
me
i
hardly
think
any
of
the
other
servants
had
opportunities
of
doing
so
and
yet
i
can
not
believe
that
you
would
so
far
forget
yourself
as
to
do
what
is
not
only
wrong
but
calculated
to
involve
me
in
serious
difficulties
with
my
neighbors
i
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
master
said
phillis
but
i
tell
a
lie
i
let
jim
stay
in
my
room
that
night
and
i
been
mightily
troubled
about
it
i
was
afeard
you
would
be
angry
with
me
if
you
heard
of
it
and
yet
master
i
could
not
help
it
when
it
happened
could
not
help
it
phillis
said
weston
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
did
you
not
inform
me
of
it
that
i
might
have
sent
him
off
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
sir
said
phillis
the
tears
coming
in
her
fine
eyes
the
poor
creature
come
in
when
the
storm
was
at
its
worst
i
had
no
candle
lit
for
the
lightning
was
so
bright
that
i
had
no
call
for
any
other
light
bacchus
was
out
in
it
all
and
i
was
thinking
he
would
be
brought
in
dead
drunk
or
dead
in
earnest
when
all
at
once
jim
burst
open
the
door
and
asked
me
to
let
him
stay
there
i
know
he
had
run
away
and
at
first
i
told
him
to
go
off
and
not
be
gitting
me
into
trouble
but
master
while
i
was
sending
him
off
such
a
streak
of
lightning
come
in
and
such
a
crash
of
thunder
that
i
thought
the
almighty
had
heard
me
turn
him
out
and
would
call
me
to
account
for
it
when
jim
and
me
should
stand
before
him
at
the
judgment
day
i
told
jim
he
had
better
go
back
to
his
master
that
he
would
have
any
comfort
always
hiding
himself
and
afeard
to
show
his
face
but
he
declared
he
would
die
first
and
so
as
i
could
persuade
him
to
go
home
agin
i
could
help
myself
for
i
thought
it
would
be
a
sin
and
shame
to
turn
a
beast
out
in
such
a
storm
as
that
as
soon
as
the
day
began
to
break
and
before
too
i
woke
him
up
and
told
him
never
to
come
to
my
cabin
again
no
matter
what
happened
and
so
master
i
told
you
the
whole
truth
and
i
am
sure
you
could
have
turned
the
poor
wretch
out
to
perish
in
that
storm
no
matter
what
would
have
come
of
it
after
phillis
had
gained
confidence
as
she
proceeded
and
weston
heard
her
without
interruption
i
can
hardly
blame
you
he
then
said
for
what
you
have
done
but
phillis
it
must
never
be
repeated
jim
is
a
great
rascal
and
if
i
were
his
master
i
would
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
but
my
plantation
must
not
shelter
runaway
slaves
i
am
responsible
for
what
my
servants
do
i
should
be
inclined
to
hold
other
gentlemen
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
theirs
the
laws
of
virginia
require
the
rights
of
the
master
to
be
respected
and
though
i
sha
make
a
constable
of
myself
still
i
will
not
allow
any
such
thing
to
be
repeated
did
bacchus
know
it
no
indeed
sir
he
hates
jim
and
no
good
may
be
would
have
come
of
his
knowing
it
besides
he
was
asleep
long
after
jim
went
off
and
there
was
too
much
whiskey
in
him
to
depend
on
what
he
have
to
say
that
will
do
phillis
and
see
that
such
a
thing
never
happens
again
said
weston
phillis
went
back
to
her
ironing
assured
her
master
was
not
angry
with
her
yet
she
sighed
as
she
thought
of
his
saying
see
that
such
a
thing
never
happens
again
if
it
had
been
a
clear
night
she
thought
within
herself
he
should
have
stayed
there
but
it
was
the
lord
himself
that
sent
the
storm
and
i
ca
see
that
he
never
sends
another
anyway
its
done
and
ca
be
helped
and
phillis
busied
herself
with
her
work
and
her
children
i
have
not
given
phillis
cottage
as
a
specimen
of
the
cabins
of
the
negroes
of
the
south
it
is
described
from
the
house
of
a
favorite
servant
yet
are
their
cabins
generally
healthy
and
airy
interest
as
well
as
a
wish
for
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
the
slave
dictates
an
attention
to
his
wants
and
feelings
slavery
says
voltaire
is
as
ancient
as
war
war
as
human
nature
it
is
to
be
wished
that
had
some
such
intimate
connection
with
human
nature
who
for
instance
could
read
without
an
indignant
thought
the
following
description
from
the
pen
of
stowe
they
their
cabins
were
rude
shells
destitute
of
any
pieces
of
furniture
except
a
heap
of
straw
foul
with
dirt
spread
confusedly
over
the

the
small
village
was
alive
with
no
inviting
sounds
hoarse
guttural
voices
contending
at
the
handmills
where
their
morsel
of
hard
corn
was
yet
to
be
ground
into
meal
to
fit
it
for
the
cake
that
was
to
constitute

supper

such
statements
need
no
denial
the
very
appearance
of
the

themselves
show
their
want
of

look
at
their
sound
and
healthy
limbs
hear
the
odd
but
sweet
and
musical
song
that
arrests
the
traveler
as
he
goes
on
his
way
listen
to
the
ready
jest
which
is
ever
on
his
lips
and
see
if
the
slavery
which
god
has
permitted
in
all
ages
to
exist
is
as
is
here
described
and
judge
if
our
fair
southern
land
is
tenanted
by
such
fiends
as
they
are
represented
to
be
by
those
who
are
trying
to
make
still
worse
the
condition
of
a
mass
of
god
creatures
born
to
a
life
of
toil

comparative
freedom
from
care

it
be
his
will
that

should

and

that
will
is
not

there
are

there
for

when
the

advances
other

xi

alice
said
barbour

the
trump
of

scrape
of

warmest
nights

dance

let

alice
where

to
see
uncle
bacchus
professional
airs
ole
bull
ca
exceed
him
in
that
respect
nor
equal
him
said
barbour
bacchus
is
a
musician
by
nature
his
time
is
perfect
his
soul
is
absorbed
in
his
twangs
and
flourishes

weston

said
weston
aunt
phillis
was
smoking
outside
her
door
her
mind
divided
between
speculations
as
to
what
had
become
of
jim
and
observations
on
the
servants
as
they
were
collecting
from
every
direction
to
join
in
the
dancing
or
to
find
a
good
seat
to
look
on
the
first
sound
of
the
banjo
aroused
bacchus
the
younger
from
his
dreams
he
bounded
from
his
bed
on
the
chest
regardless
of
the
figure
he
cut
in
his
very
slight
dishabille
and
proceeded
to
the
front
door
as
his
mother
would
have
said
on
having
his
own
way
oh
mammy
he
said
dare
de
banjo
what
you
doin
here
said
phillis
go
long
to
bed
this
minute
i
take
a
switch
to
you
oh
mammy
said
the
boy
regardless
of
the
threat
in
his
enthusiastic
state
of
mind
jist
listen
daddy
gwine
to
play
you
ever
see
the
devil
will
any
body
listen
to
the
boy
if
you
do
go
to
bed
oh
mammy
lem

jake
he

massa
said
i
beat
jake
dancin
one
o
dese
days
high
said
phillis
where
the
sore
foot
you
had
this
morning
its
done
got
well
it
got
well
a
little
while
ago
while
i
was
asleep
bound
for
you
go
long
said
phillis
bacchus
was
about
to
go
without
the
slightest
addition
to
his
toilet
come
back
here
said
phillis
you
real
cornfield
nigger
you
goin
there
naked
the
boy
turned
back
and
thrust
his
legs
in
a
pair
of
pants
with
twine
for
suspenders
his
motions
were
much
delayed
by
his
nervous
state
of
agitation
the
consequence
of
the
music
which
was
now
going
on
in
earnest
he
got
off
finally
not
without
a
parting
admonition
from
his
mother
look
here
said
she
if
you
do
behave
yourself
i
skin
you
allusion
to
this
mysterious
mode
of
punishment
had
the
effect
of
sobering
the
boy
mind
in
a
very
slight
degree
no
sooner
was
he
out
of
his
mother
sight
than
his
former
vivacity
returned
his
father
meanwhile
had
turned
down
a
barrel
and
was
seated
on
it
every
attitude
every
motion
of
his
body
told
that
his
soul
forgetful
of
earth
and
earthly
things
had
withdrawn
to
the
regions
of
sound
he
kicked
his
slippers
off
keeping
time
and
his
head
dodged
about
with
every
turn
of
the
quick
tune
a
stranger
not
understanding
the
state
of
mind
into
which
a
negro
gets
after
playing
the
devil
among
the
tailors
would
have
supposed
he
was
afflicted
with
vitus
dance
the
mistake
would
soon
have
been
perceived
for
two
of
the
boys
having
tired
themselves
out
with
manoeuvres
of
every
kind
were
obliged
to
sit
down
to
get
some
breath
and
bacchus
fell
into
a
sentimental
mood
after
a
little
tuning
up
it
was
uncertain
in
what
strain
he
would
finally
go
off
first
came
a
bar
that
sounded
like
auld
lang
syne
then
a
note
or
two
of
days
of
absence
then
a
turn
of
a
methodist
hymn
at
last
he
went
decidedly
into
nelly
was
a
lady
the
tune
of
this
william
had
learned
from
alice
singing
it
to
the
piano
he
begged
her
to
teach
him
the
words
she
did
so
telling
him
of
the
chorus
part
in
which
many
were
to
unite
bacchus
prepared
an
accompaniment
a
number
of
them
sang
it
together
william
sang
the
solos
he
had
a
remarkably
good
voice
and
fine
taste
he
therefore
did
justice
to
the
sweet
song
when
the
full
but
subdued
chorus
burst
upon
the
ear
every
heart
felt
the
power
of
the
simple
strain
the
master
with
his
educated
mind
and
cultivated
taste
and
the
slave
with
the
complete
power
of
enjoyment
with
which
the
creator
has
endowed
him
hardly
had
the
cadence
of
the
last
note
died
away
when
shout
shout
the
devil
about
was
heard
from
a
stentorian
voice
above
the
peals
of
laughter
with
which
the
words
were
received
rose
jake
voice
come
on
ole
fiddler
play
somefin
a
nigger
kin
kick
up
his
heels
to
what
de
use
of
singing
after
dat
fashion
dis
aint
no
meetin
what
you
have
jake
said
bacchus
what
i
have
why
i
never
dances
to
but
one
tune
and
jake
started
the
first
line
of
oh
plantation
gals
ca
you
look
at
a
body
while
bacchus
was
giving
a
prelude
of
scrapes
and
twangs
jake
made
a
circle
of
somersets
and
come
down
on
his
head
with
his
heels
in
the
air
going
through
flourishes
that
would
have
astonished
an
uninitiated
observer
as
it
was
jake
audience
were
in
a
high
condition
of
enjoyment
they
were
in
a
constant
state
of
expectation
as
to
where
he
would
turn
up
or
what
would
be
the
nature
of
the
next
caper
now
he
cut
the
for
a
length
of
time
that
made
the
spectators
hold
their
breath
then
he
would
so
to
speak
stand
on
his
hands
and
with
his
feet
give
a
push
to
the
barrel
where
uncle
bacchus
was
sitting
and
nearly
roll
the
old
man
underneath
one
moment
he
is
dancing
with
every
limb
making
the
most
curious
contortions
of
his
face
rolling
out
his
tongue
turning
his
eyes
wrong
side
out
suddenly
he
stretches
himself
on
the
grass
snoring
to
a
degree
that
might
be
heard
at
almost
any
distance
starting
up
he
snaps
his
fingers
twirls
round
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
till
feeling
the
time
approaching
when
he
must
give
up
he
strikes
up
again
shout
shout
the
devil
about
shut
the
door
and
keep
him
out
leaps
frog
over
two
or
three
of
the
servants
shoulders
disappearing
from
among
them
in
an
immoderate
state
of
conceit
and
perspiration
bacchus
is
forced
at
this
crisis
to
put
down
the
banjo
and
wipe
his
face
with
his
sleeve
breathing
very
hard
he
was
thinking
he
would
get
near
so
tired
if
he
had
a
little
of
the
oh
be
joyful
to
keep
up
his
spirits
but
such
aspirations
were
utterly
hopeless
at
the
present
time
getting
tipsy
while
his
master
and
barbour
and
alice
were
looking
at
him
was
quite
out
of
the
question
he
made
a
merit
of
keeping
sober
too
on
the
ground
of
setting
a
good
example
to
the
young
servants
he
consoled
himself
with
a
piece
of
tobacco
and
rested
after
his
efforts
his
promising
son
danced
juba
at
weston
particular
request
and
was
rewarded
by
great
applause
a
little
courting
scene
was
going
on
at
this
time
not
far
distant
esther
phillis
third
daughter
was
a
neat
servant
entirely
above
associating
with
common
niggers
as
she
styled
those
who
being
constantly
employed
about
the
field
had
not
the
advantage
of
being
called
upon
in
the
house
and
were
thus
very
deficient
in
manners
and
appearance
from
those
who
were
so
much
under
the
eye
of
the
family
esther
like
her
mother
was
a
great
methodist
reading
well
she
was
familiar
with
the
bible
and
had
committed
to
memory
a
vast
number
of
hymns
these
she
and
her
sister
with
william
often
sung
in
the
kitchen
or
at
her
cabin
miss
janet
declared
it
reminded
her
of
the
employment
of
the
saints
in
heaven
more
than
any
church
music
she
had
ever
heard
especially
when
they
sang
there
is
a
land
of
pure
delight
that
heart
must
be
steeled
against
the
sweet
influences
of
the
christian
religion
which
listens
not
with
an
earnest
pleasure
to
the
voice
of
the
slave
singing
the
songs
of
zion
no
matter
how
kind
his
master
or
how
great
and
varied
his
comforts
he
is
a
slave
his
soul
can
not
on
earth
be
animated
to
attain
aught
save
the
enjoyment
of
the
passing
hour
why
need
he
recall
the
past
the
present
does
not
differ
from
it
toil
toil
however
mitigated
by
the
voice
of
kindness
need
he
essay
to
penetrate
the
future
it
is
still
toil
softened
though
it
be
by
the
consideration
which
is
universally
shown
to
the
feelings
and
weaknesses
of
old
age
yet
has
the
creator
who
placed
him
in
this
state
mercifully
provided
for
it
the
slave
has
not
the
hopes
of
the
master
but
he
is
without
many
of
his
cares
he
may
not
strive
after
wealth
yet
he
is
always
provided
with
comfort
ambition
with
its
longings
for
fame
and
riches
and
power
never
stimulates
his
breast
that
breast
is
safe
from
its
disappointments
his
enjoyments
though
few
equal
his
expectations
his
occupations
though
servile
resemble
the
mass
of
those
around
him
his
eye
can
see
the
beauties
of
nature
his
ear
drinks
in
her
harmonies
his
soul
content
itself
with
what
is
passing
in
the
limited
world
around
him
yet
he
is
a
slave
and
if
he
is
ever
elevated
above
his
condition
it
is
when
praising
the
god
of
the
white
man
and
the
black
when
with
uplifted
voice
he
sings
the
songs
of
the
redeemed
when
looking
forward
to
the
invitation
which
he
hopes
to
receive
come
in
thou
servant
of
the
lord
christian
of
the
south
remember
who
it
was
that
bore
thy
saviour
cross
when
toiling
and
weary
and
fainting
beneath
it
he
trod
the
hill
of
calvary
not
one
of
the
rich
learned
or
great
not
one
of
thine
ancestors
though
thou
mayest
boast
of
their
wealth
and
learning
and
heroic
acts
it
was
a
black
man
who
relieved
him
of
his
heavy
burden
simon
of
cyrene
was
his
name
christian
of
the
north
canst
thou
emancipate
the
southern
slave
canst
thou
change
his
employments
and
elevate
his
condition
impossible
beware
then
lest
thou
add
to
his
burden
and
tighten
his
bonds
and
deprive
him
of
the
simple
enjoyments
which
are
now
allowed
him
esther
seated
on
the
steps
of
a
small
porch
attached
to
the
side
of
the
house
was
mentally
treating
with
great
contempt
the
amusements
of
the
other
servants
she
had
her
mother
disposition
and
disliked
any
thing
like
noisy
mirth
having
an
idea
it
was
not
genteel
seeing
so
little
of
it
in
her
master
family
she
was
an
active
cheerful
girl
but
free
from
any
thing
like
levity
in
her
manner
she
had
a
most
devoted
admirer
in
the
neighborhood
no
less
a
personage
than
kent
coachman
his
name
was
robert
after
kent
father
assuming
the
family
name
he
was
known
as
robert
carter
phillis
called
him
a
harmless
goose
of
a
fellow
and
this
gives
the
best
idea
of
his
character
he
understood
all
about
horses
and
nothing
else
if
we
except
the
passion
of
love
which
was
the
constant
subject
of
his
conversation
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
court
esther
and
with
that
in
view
he
dressed
himself
in
full
livery
as
if
he
were
going
to
take
his
mistress
an
airing
he
asks
kent
permission
to
be
married
though
he
had
not
the
slightest
reason
to
suppose
esther
would
accept
him
with
a
confidence
and
that
man
in
general
is
apt
to
feel
when
he
has
determined
to
bestow
himself
upon
some
fortunate
fair
one
he
went
his
way
passing
the
dancers
without
any
notice
and
going
straight
to
that
part
of
the
house
where
he
supposed
he
should
find
esther
esther
received
him
with
politeness
but
with
some
reserve
not
having
a
chair
to
offer
him
and
not
intending
him
to
take
a
seat
on
the
steps
beside
her
she
stood
up
and
leaned
against
the
porch
they
talked
a
little
of
the
weather
and
the
health
of
the
different
members
of
their
respective
families
during
which
robert
took
the
opportunity
to
say
his
master
kent
had
a
bilious
attack
and
he
wished
to
the
lord
he
never
get
better
of
it
finally
he
undid
one
of
the
buttons
of
his
coat
which
was
getting
too
small
for
him
and
drawing
a
long
breath
proceeded
to
lay
himself
figuratively
at
esther
feet
he
did
not
come
to
the
point
at
once
but
drove
round
it
as
if
there
might
be
some
impediment
in
the
way
which
though
it
could
not
possibly
upset
the
whole
affair
might
make
a
little
unnecessary
delay
esther
thought
he
was
only
talking
nonsense
as
usual
but
when
he
waxed
warm
and
energetic
in
his
professions
she
interrupted
him
with
look
here
robert
out
of
your
head
aint
you
no
deed
miss
esther
but
i
dying
in
love
with

thing

esther

robert

happiest

white
minister

esther

say

esther

would
marry
you
to
save
your
life

earnest

said
esther
so
you

be
coming
here
on
any
such
fool
errand

esther
said
robert
reproachfully
after
my
walking
home
from
meeting
with
you
and
thinking
and
dreaming
about
you
as
i
have
for
this
long
time

to

esther
then
i
bid
you
good
night
and
look
here
esther
mistress
will
lose
one
of
her
most
valuable
servants
for
i
shall
hang
myself
esther
went
up
the
steps
and
shut
the
door
on
him
internally
marvelling
at
the
impudence
of
men
in
general
robert
with
a
strong
inclination
to
shed
tears
turned
his
steps
homeward
he
told
kent
the
next
morning
that
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
not
to
be
married
for
some
time
yet
women
were
so
troublesome
and
there
was
no
knowing
how
things
would
turn
out
kent
saw
he
was
much
dejected
and
concluded
there
were
sour
grapes
in
the
question
after
due
consideration
robert
determined
not
to
commit
suicide
he
did
something
equally
desperate
he
married
kent
maid
an
ugly
girl
who
had
hitherto
been
his
especial
aversion
he
could
not
though
entirely
erase
esther
image
from
his
heart
always
feeling
a
tendency
to
choke
when
he
heard
her
voice
in
meeting
esther
told
her
mother
of
the
offer
she
had
had
and
phillis
quite
agreed
with
her
in
thinking
robert
was
crazy
she
charged
esther
to
know
when
she
was
well
off
and
not
to
bring
trouble
upon
herself
by
getting
married
or
any
such
foolishness
as
that
chapter
xii
i
tell
you
what
abel
said
arthur
weston
the
more
i
think
about
you
northern
people
the
harder
it
is
for
me
to
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
what
you
are
made
of
ca
you
experiment
upon
us
arthur
test
us
chemically
do
believe
you
could
be
tested
said
arthur
you
are
such
a
slippery
set
now
here
is
a
book
i
have
been
looking
over
called
annals
of
salem
by
joseph
b
felt
published
in
on
the
page
it
says
pierce
of
the
ship
desire
belonging
to
this
port
was
commissioned
to
transport
fifteen
boys
and
one
hundred
women
of
the
captive
pequods
to
bermuda
and
sell
them
as
slaves
he
was
obliged
however
to
make
for
providence
island
there
he
disposed
of
the
indians
he
returned
from
tortugas
the
of
february
following
with
a
cargo
of
cotton
tobacco
salt
and
negroes
in
the
edition
of
this
interesting
fact
is
omitted
now
was
not
that
trading
in
human
bodies
and
souls
in
earnest
first
they
got
all
they
could
for
those
poor
captive
pequods
and
they
traded
the
amount
again
for
negroes
and
some
you
are
the
very
people
to
make
a
fuss
about
your
neighbours
having
been
so
excessively
righteous
yourselves
no
wonder
that
the
author
left
it
out
in
a
succeeding
edition
i
am
surprised
he
ever
put
it
in
at
all
it
seems
more
like
peddling
with
the
poor
devils
than
any
thing
else
said
abel
but
you
must
remember
the
of
the
arthur
as
hubbard
calls
it
yes
said
arthur
i
forgot
that
but
i
wonder
if
hubbard
excuses
the
conduct
of
england
to
her
colonies
in
consideration
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
allowed
taxation
and
all
of
her
other
forms
of
oppression
i
suppose
it
is
a
kind
of
charity
that
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
but
i
was
saying
continued
arthur
that
i
could
not
make
you
out
while
they
were
carrying
on
two
kinds
of
slave
trade
they
were
discussing
in
boston
the
propriety
of
women
wearing
veils
having
lectures
about
it
let
me
read
to
you
cotton
though
while
in
england
of
an
opposite
opinion
on
this
subject
maintained
that
in
countries
where
veils
were
to
be
a
sign
of
submission
they
might
be
properly
disused
but
endicott
took
different
ground
and
endeavored
to
retain
it
by
general
argument
from
paul
williams
sided
with
his
parishioner
through
his
and
others
influence
veils
were
worn
abundantly
at
the
time
they
were
the
most
fashionable
cotton
came
to
preach
for
skelton
his
subject
was
upon
wearing
veils
he
endeavored
to
prove
that
this
was
a
custom
not
to
be
tolerated
the
consequence
was
that
the
ladies
became
converts
to
his
faith
in
this
particular
and
for
a
long
time
left
off
an
article
of
dress
which
indicated
too
great
a
degree
of
submission
to
the
lords
of
creation
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
set
of
old
meddlers
lecturing
and
preaching
about
women
dressing
i
suppose
the
men
wore
petticoats
at
that
time
themselves
if
they
did
said
abel
i
am
very
glad
they
have
turned
them
over
to
the
other
sex
since
as
they
are
worn
in
the
number
which
the
present
fashion
requires
i
should
think
they
would
be
very
uncomfortable
but
arthur
i
heard
such
a
good
story
the
other
day
about
lawyer
page
he
fights
bravely
with
his
tongue
for
other
people
rights
but
he
say
his
soul
his
own
before
his
wife
well
when
that
affair
came
out
about
morton
whipping
his
wife
as
he
was
going
to
the
courthouse
page
said
to
old
captain
caldwell
you
know
captain
that
before
all
the
facts
were
out
in
this
case
about
morton
they
actually
had
it
in
every
direction
that
it
was
i
who
had
whipped
my
wife
page
said
the
old
captain
know
that
no
such
thing
for
every
body
in
new
haven
is
well
aware
that
when
there
was
any
flogging
going
on
in
the
matrimonial
line
in
your
house
it
was
you
that
came
off
the
worst
page
did
not
say
a
word
i
am
glad
i
am
not
yoked
with
one
of
your
new
haven
belles
if
turning
a
jerry
sneak
is
to
be
the
consequence
said
arthur
this
marrying
is
a
terrible
necessity
arthur
said
abel
i
do
know
how
i
be
supported
under
it
when
my
time
comes
but
after
all
i
think
the
women
get
the
worst
of
it
there
were
not
two
prettier
girls
in
new
haven
than
my
sisters
julia
who
has
been
married
some
eight
or
nine
years
was
really
beautiful
and
so
animated
and
cheerful
now
she
has
that
look
of
care
forever
on
her
countenance
her
husband
is
always
reproaching
her
that
that
little
dare
devil
of
a
son
of
hers
does
not
keep
his
clothes
clean
the
other
evening
i
was
at
their
house
and
they
were
having
a
little
matrimonial
discussion
about
it
it
seems
little
charlie
had
been
picked
up
out
of
the
mud
in
the
afternoon
and
brought
in
in
such
a
condition
that
it
was
sometime
before
he
could
be
identified
after
being
immersed
in
a
bathing
tub
it
was
ascertained
that
he
had
not
a
clean
suit
of
clothes
so
the
young
gentleman
was
confined
to
his
chamber
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
a
night
gown
this
my
considered
a
great
hardship
and
they
were
talking
the
matter
over
when
i
went
in
do
you
make
the
boy
clothes
enough
julia
said
he
am
forever
making
and
forever
mending
said
julia
it
is
impossible
to
keep
that
young
one
clean
he
had
twelve
pairs
of
pantaloons
in
the
wash
last
week
and
the
girl
was
sick
and
i
had
to
iron
them
myself
i
guess
if
you
had
all
the
trouble
i
have
with
him
you
would
put
him
to
bed
and
make
him
stay
there
a
week
tell
you
what
it
is
good
people
said
i
i
go
courting
i
intend
to
ask
the
lady
in
the
first
place
if
she
likes
to
make
boys
clothes
if
she
says
no
i
sha
have
her
no
matter
what
other
recommendations
she
may
possess
be
sure
to
give
you
the
mitten
for
your
impudence
said
julia
then
there
is
my
pretty
sister
harriet
quilting
quilts
trimming
nightcaps
and
spoiling
her
bright
eyes
making
her
after
a
while
she
be
undergoing
some
of
the
troubles
of
the
married
state
which
will
lengthen
her
face
the
men
get
the
best
of
it
decidedly
for
they
have
not
all
the
petty
annoyances
a
woman
must
encounter
what
do
you
think
about
it
arthur
i
hardly
know
said
arthur
i
have
been
in
love
ever
since
i
could
tell
my
right
hand
from
my
left
i
have
hardly
ever
looked
forward
to
marriage
my
time
has
been
so
much
occupied
here
that
when
i
get
a
few
moments
for
reflection
my
thoughts
go
back
to
alice
and
the
happy
years
i
have
passed
with
her
rather
than
to
anticipations
of
any
kind
i
suppose
i
shall
find
out
though
and
then
you
may
profit
by
my
experience
you
will
have
a
sad
experience
with
those
niggers
of
yours
i
am
afraid
arthur
said
abel
our
people
are
determined
never
to
let
them
alone
i
wonder
you
do
not
employ
white
hands
upon
the
plantation
and
have
done
with
any
trouble
about
the
matter
what
would
be
done
with
the
slaves
in
the
mean
time
said
arthur
set
free
said
abel
colonize
or
hang
all
the
latter
is
the
more
practicable
suggestion
said
arthur
as
to
setting
them
free
they
could
not
remain
in
virginia
afterward
if
i
were
willing
to
do
so
there
is
a
law
against
it
colonizing
them
would
be
equally
difficult
for
the
most
of
them
would
refuse
to
go
to
africa
and
if
i
have
not
the
right
to
hold
them
slaves
i
certainly
have
not
a
right
to
force
them
into
another
country
some
of
them
would
be
willing
and
glad
to
come
to
the
north
but
some
would
object
my
father
set
a
free
he
was
absent
a
year
and
returned
voluntarily
to
his
old
condition
mark
had
got
some
abolition
notions
in
his
head
and
my
father
told
him
he
might
have
his
free
papers
and
go
i
have
told
you
the
result
the
fact
is
abel
you
yankees
do
stand
very
well
with
our
slaves
they
seem
to
consider
you
a
race
of
pedlars
who
come
down
upon
them
in
small
bodies
for
their
sins
to
wheedle
away
all
their
little
hoardings
my
father
has
several
times
brought
servants
to
new
york
but
they
have
never
run
away
from
him
i
think
virginia
would
do
well
without
her
colored
people
because
her
climate
is
moderate
and
white
labor
could
be
substituted
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
more
southern
states
i
would
like
to
see
a
louisiana
sun
shining
upon
your
new
england
states
for
a
while
how
quickly
you
would
fit
out
an
expedition
for
africa
it
is
the
mere
accident
of
climate
that
makes
your
states
free
ones
i
suppose
so
said
abel
a
great
many
of
your
slaves
run
away
through
the
year
do
they
no
indeed
said
arthur
comparatively
very
few
just
before
i
came
to
new
haven
i
went
to
pass
a
few
weeks
at
a
plantation
belonging
to
a
family
with
whom
we
were
intimate
one
of
the
sons
and
i
went
on
the
river
two
of
the
servants
rowing
us
i
said
to
one
of
them
a
large
fat
negro
your
name
uncle
sir
he
said
said
i
you
ought
to
have
two
brothers
one
named
shadrach
and
the
other
abednego
i
had
sir
what
has
become
of
them
said
i
he
dead
he
answered
where
is
abednego
said
i
gone
too
he
replied
in
a
low
voice
my
friend
gave
me
a
look
and
told
me
afterwards
that
abednego
had
ran
away
and
that
his
family
considered
it
a
disgrace
and
never
spoke
of
him
i
hear
of
a
negro
boy
who
absconded
and
when
he
was
found
and
being
brought
home
an
old
washerwoman
watched
him
as
he
went
up
the
street
said
she
a
thought
he
a
beginned
to
act
bad
so
young
but
let
us
leave
off
abolition
and
take
a
walk
our
cigars
are
out
and
we
will
resume
the
subject
afternoon
when
we
light
some
more
now
said
abel
having
a
couple
of
particularly
good
cigars
where
did
we
leave
off
its
too
warm
for
argument
said
arthur
watching
the
curling
of
the
gray
smoke
as
it
ascended
we
need
not
argue
said
abel
i
want
to
catechize
you
begin
do
you
think
that
the
african
can
be
defended
no
assuredly
not
well
said
abel
how
can
you
defend
your
right
to
hold
slaves
as
property
in
the
united
states
abel
said
arthur
when
a
yankee
begins
to
question
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
he
ever
intends
to
stop
i
shall
answer
your
queries
from
the
views
of
governor
hammond
of
carolina
they
are
at
least
worthy
of
consideration
what
right
have
you
new
england
people
to
the
farms
you
are
now
holding
the
right
of
owning
them
said
abel
from
whom
did
you
get
them
asked
arthur
our
fathers
and
how
did
they
get
them
from
the
red
men
their
original
owners
well
said
arthur
we
all
know
how
these
transactions
were
conducted
all
over
the
country
we
wanted
the
lands
of
the
red
men
and
we
took
them
sometimes
they
were
purchased
sometimes
they
were
wrested
always
the
red
men
were
treated
with
injustice
they
were
driven
off
slaughtered
and
taken
as
slaves
now
god
as
clearly
gave
these
lands
to
the
red
men
as
he
gave
life
and
freedom
to
the
african
both
have
been
unjustly
taken
away
but
said
abel
we
hold
property
in
land
you
in
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
granted
said
arthur
but
we
have
as
good
a
right
to
our
as
you
to
yours
we
each
inherit
it
from
our
fathers
you
must
know
that
slaves
were
recognized
as
under
the
constitution
john
adams
speaking
of
the
protection
extended
to
the
peculiar
interests
of
south
makes
these
remarks
by
the
advantage
of
representation
on
this
floor
protected
by
the
stipulation
in
the
constitution
for
the
recovery
of
fugitive
slaves
protected
by
the
guarantee
in
the
constitution
to
owners
of
this
of
against
domestic
violence
it
was
considered
in
england
as
any
other
kind
of
commerce
so
that
you
can
not
deny
our
right
to
consider
them
as
property
now
as
well
as
then
but
can
you
advocate
the
enslaving
of
your
fellow
man
said
abel
no
said
arthur
if
you
put
the
question
in
that
manner
but
if
you
come
to
the
point
and
ask
me
if
i
can
conscientiously
hold
in
bondage
slaves
in
the
south
i
say
yes
without
the
slightest
hesitation
i
tell
you
why
you
must
agree
with
me
if
the
bible
allow
slavery
there
is
no
sin
it
now
the
bible
does
allow
it
you
must
read
those
letters
of
governor
hammond
to
clarkson
the
english
abolitionist
the
tenth
commandment
your
mother
taught
you
no
doubt
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbor
house
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbor
wife
nor
his
nor
his
nor
his
ox
nor
his
ass
nor
any
thing
that
is
thy
neighbor
these
are
the
words
of
god
and
as
such
should
be
obeyed
strictly
in
the
most
solemn
manner
the
and
the
are
considered
the
of
thy
neighbor
generally
the
word
is
rendered
slave
this
command
includes
all
classes
of
servants
there
is
the
who
shall
go
out
in
the
seventh
year
and
the
and
those
from
the
heathen
round
about
who
were
to
be
bondmen
forever
in
leviticus
speaking
of
the
of
the
heathen
which
shall
be
round
about
god
says
ye
shall
take
them
for
an
inheritance
for
your
children
after
you
to
inherit
them
for
a
possession
they
shall
be
your
bondmen
forever
i
consider
that
god
permitted
slavery
when
he
made
laws
for
the
master
and
the
slave
therefore
i
am
justified
in
holding
slaves
in
the
times
of
our
saviour
when
slavery
existed
in
its
worst
form
it
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
human
society
it
is
evident
abolition
was
not
shadowed
forth
by
christ
or
his
apostles
unto
all
men
as
ye
would
have
them
do
unto
you
is
a
general
command
inducing
charity
and
kindness
among
all
classes
of
men
and
does
not
authorize
interference
with
the
established
customs
of
society
if
according
to
this
precept
of
christ
i
am
obliged
to
manumit
my
slaves
you
are
equally
forced
to
purchase
them
if
i
were
a
slave
i
would
have
my
master
free
me
if
you
were
a
slave
and
your
owner
would
not
give
you
freedom
you
would
have
some
rich
man
to
buy
you
from
the
early
ages
of
the
world
there
existed
the
poor
and
the
rich
the
master
and
the
slave
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
southern
slaves
if
our
institution
as
regards
them
were
left
to
mitigation
and
decay
which
time
bring
about
the
course
of
the
abolitionists
while
it
does
nothing
to
destroy
this
institution
greatly
adds
to
its
hardships
tell
me
that
is
a
sin
and
i
will
agree
with
you
and
will
insist
that
the
abolitionists
are
guilty
of
it
in
my
opinion
those
who
consider
slavery
a
sin
challenge
the
truth
of
the
bible
besides
abel
continued
arthur
what
right
have
you
to
interfere
your
northern
states
abolished
slavery
when
it
was
their
interest
to
do
so
let
us
do
the
same
in
the
meantime
consider
the
condition
of
these
dirty
vagabonds
these
free
blacks
who
are
begging
from
me
every
time
i
go
into
the
street
i
met
one
the
other
day
who
had
a
most
lamentable
state
of
things
to
report
he
had
rheumatism
and
a
cough
and
he
spit
blood
and
he
had
no
tobacco
and
he
was
hungry
and
he
had
the
toothache
i
gave
him
cents
as
a
sort
of
panacea
and
advised
him
to
travel
south
and
get
a
good
master
he
took
the
money
but
not
the
advice
but
arthur
the
danger
of
insurrection
i
should
think
it
would
interfere
greatly
with
your
comfort
we
do
not
fear
it
said
arthur
mobs
of
any
kind
are
rare
in
the
southern
country
we
are
not
in
spite
of
the
bad
qualities
ascribed
to
us
by
the
abolitionists
a
fussy
people
sometimes
when
an
abolitionist
comes
along
we
have
a
little
fun
with
him
the
negroes
enjoying
it
exceedingly
slaveholders
as
a
general
thing
desire
to
live
a
peaceful
quiet
life
yet
they
are
not
willing
to
have
their
rights
wrested
from
them
one
great
disadvantage
in
a
slaveholding
community
is
that
you
are
apt
to
be
surrounded
by
uneducated
people
said
abel
we
do
not
educate
our
slaves
said
arthur
but
you
do
not
presume
to
say
that
we
do
not
cultivate
our
minds
as
assiduously
as
you
do
yours
our
statesmen
are
not
inferior
to
yours
in
natural
ability
nor
in
the
improvement
of
it
we
have
far
more
time
to
improve
ourselves
than
you
as
a
general
thing
when
you
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
you
will
not
hesitate
to
say
that
our
women
can
bear
to
be
compared
with
yours
in
every
respect
in
their
intellect
and
refinement
of
manners
and
conversation
our
slaves
are
not
left
ignorant
like
brutes
as
has
been
charged
upon
us
where
a
master
feels
a
religious
responsibility
he
must
and
does
cause
to
be
given
all
necessary
knowledge
to
those
who
are
dependent
upon
him
i
must
say
that
though
we
have
fewer
sects
at
the
south
we
have
more
genuine
religion
you
will
think
i
am
prejudiced
joining
the
church
here
is
in
a
great
measure
a
form
i
have
formed
this
opinion
from
my
own
observation
with
us
there
must
be
a
proper
disregard
of
the
customs
of
the
world
a
profession
of
religion
implying
a
good
deal
more
than
a
mere
profession
look
at
the
thousand
new
and
absurd
opinions
that
have
agitated
new
england
while
they
never
have
been
advanced
with
us
there
is
unitarianism
that
faith
that
would
undermine
the
perfect
structure
of
the
christian
religion
that
says
christ
is
a
man
when
the
scriptures
style
him
counsellor
the
mighty
god
the
everlasting
father
the
prince
of
peace
why
it
is
hardly
tolerated
at
the
south
have
you
any
right
to
claim
for
yourself
superior
holiness
none
whatever
there
never
was
any
thing
so
perfectly
false
i
can
not
help
referring
to
it
again
as
that
religion
is
discouraged
among
our
slaves
it
is
precisely
the
contrary
most
of
them
have
the
same
opportunities
of
attending
worship
as
their
owners
they
generally
prefer
the
methodist
and
baptist
denominations
they
worship
with
the
whites
or
they
have
exclusive
occasions
for
themselves
which
they
prefer
they
meet
on
the
plantations
for
prayer
for
singing
or
for
any
religious
purpose
when
they
choose
the
ladies
on
the
plantations
instruct
them
in
the
bible
and
how
to
read
it
many
of
them
are
taught
to
write
religion
seems
to
be
a
necessary
qualification
of
the
female
mind
i
think
this
because
i
have
been
so
fortunate
in
those
of
our
own
family
my
mother
died
soon
after
my
birth
her
friends
often
dwell
on
the
early
piety
so
beautifully
developed
in
her
character
we
have
a
relative
an
old
maid
who
lives
with
us
she
forgets
her
own
existence
laboring
always
for
the
good
of
others
my
aunt
is
a
noble
christian
woman
and
alice
has
not
breathed
such
an
atmosphere
in
vain
we
have
a
servant
woman
named
phillis
her
price
is
far
above
rubies
her
industry
her
honesty
her
attachment
to
our
family
exceeds
every
thing
i
wish
abolitionists
would
imitate
one
of
her
virtues
humility
i
know
of
no
poetry
more
beautiful
than
the
hymns
she
sang
to
me
in
my
infancy
her
whole
life
has
been
a
recommendation
of
the
religion
of
the
bible
i
wish
my
chance
of
heaven
were
half
as
good
as
hers
she
is
a
slave
here
but
she
is
destined
to
be
a
saint
hereafter
chapter
xiii
the
evening
is
drawing
on
again
at
exeter
and
alice
and
her
mother
are
in
a
little
sitting
room
that
opens
on
the
porch
weston
is
fanning
her
daughter
who
has
been
suffering
during
the
day
from
headache
miss
janet
is
there
too
and
for
a
rare
occurrence
is
idle
looking
from
the
window
at
the
tall
peaks
of
the
blue
ridge
upon
which
she
has
gazed
for
many
a
year
little
lydia
stands
by
her
side
her
round
eyes
peering
into
miss
janet
face
wondering
what
would
happen
that
she
should
be
unemployed
they
are
awaiting
weston
return
from
an
afternoon
ride
to
meet
at
the
last
and
most
sociable
meal
of
the
day
miss
janet
said
lydia
aint
miss
alice
white
very
pale
said
miss
janet
looking
at
alice
then
with
a
sigh
turning
to
the
mountains
again
what
makes
her
so
white
asked
lydia
in
an
under
tone
she
has
had
a
headache
all
day
be
quiet
child
said
miss
janet
after
a
moment
lydia
said
i
wish
i
could
have
de
headache
all
de
time
what
do
you
say
such
a
foolish
thing
as
that
for
lydia
i
like
to
be
white
like
miss
alice
miss
janet
did
not
reply
again
lydia
spoke
if
i
was
to
stay
all
time
in
de
house
and
never
go
in
de
sun
would
i
git
white
no
no
foolish
child
what
gives
you
such
ideas
there
was
another
pause
weston
fanned
alice
who
with
closed
eyes
laid
languidly
on
the
lounge
miss
janet
said
lydia
speaking
very
softly
who
made
de
god
made
them
said
miss
janet
did
god
make
de
too
you
know
that
god
made
every
thing
said
miss
janet
i
have
often
told
you
so
he
did
make
mammy
house
i
seed
de
men
makin
it
no
man
makes
houses
but
god
made
all
the
beautiful
things
in
nature
he
made
man
and
trees
and
rivers
and
such
things
as
man
could
not
make
lydia
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
sun
had
set
and
the
moon
was
coming
forth
a
few
stars
glistened
there
long
fleecy
clouds
extended
over
the
arch
of
heaven
and
some
passing
ones
for
a
moment
obscured
the
brightness
that
gilded
the
beautiful
scene
miss
janet
said
lydia
its
mighty
pretty
there
but
it
was
to
fall
what
was
to
fall
de
sky
it
can
not
fall
god
holds
it
in
its
place
another
interval
and
lydia
said
miss
janet
god
was
to
die
den
de
sky
would
broke
down
what
put
such
a
dreadful
thought
into
your
head
child
said
miss
janet
god
can
not
die
yes
he
kin
said
lydia
no
he
can
not
have
i
not
often
told
you
that
god
is
a
spirit
he
created
all
things
but
he
never
was
made
he
can
not
die
lydia
said
inquiringly
was
jesus
christ
god
yes
he
was
the
son
of
god
and
he
was
god
well
he
died
onct
dat
time
de
jews
crucified
him
dat
time
de
ground
shook
and
de
dead
people
got
up
dat
time
he
was
nailed
to
de
cross
so
if
god
died
onct
could
he
die
agin
miss
janet
arousing
herself
from
her
reverie
looked
at
the
child
there
she
stood
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sky
her
soul
engaged
in
solving
this
mysterious
question
her
little
hands
hung
listlessly
by
her
side
there
was
no
beauty
in
her
face
the
black
skin
the
projecting
lips
the
heavy
features
designated
her
as
belonging
to
a
degraded
race
yet
the
soul
was
looking
forth
from
its
despised
tenement
and
eagerly
essaying
to
grasp
things
beyond
its
reach
could
he
die
agin
miss
janet
asked
lydia
poor
child
thought
miss
janet
how
the
soul
pinioned
and
borne
down
longs
to
burst
its
chains
and
to
soar
through
the
glorious
realms
of
light
and
knowledge
i
thought
but
now
that
there
was
no
more
for
me
to
do
here
that
tired
of
the
rugged
ascent
i
stood
as
it
were
on
the
tops
of
those
mountains
gazing
in
spirit
on
the
celestial
city
and
still
not
called
to
enter
in
now
i
see
there
is
work
for
me
to
do
thou
art
a
slave
lydia
yet
god
has
called
thee
to
the
freedom
of
the
children
that
he
loves
thou
art
black
yet
will
thy
soul
be
washed
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
thou
art
poor
yet
shalt
thou
be
made
rich
through
him
who
when
on
earth
was
poor
indeed
jesus
forgive
me
i
murmured
that
i
still
was
obliged
to
linger
oh
make
me
the
honored
instrument
of
good
to
this
child
and
when
thou
callest
me
hence
how
gladly
will
i
obey
the
summons
lydia
she
said
the
son
of
god
died
for
us
all
for
you
and
for
me
but
he
was
then
in
the
form
of
man
he
died
that
we
might
live
he
never
will
die
again
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
is
in
heaven
at
the
right
hand
of
god
he
loves
you
because
you
think
about
him
he
do
love
me
like
he
do
miss
alice
she
so
white
said
lydia
he
loves
all
who
love
him
said
miss
janet
whether
they
are
black
or
white
be
a
good
child
and
he
will
surely
love
you
be
kind
and
obliging
to
everybody
be
industrious
and
diligent
in
all
you
have
to
do
obey
your
mother
and
father
and
your
master
be
truthful
and
honest
god
hates
a
liar
and
a
deceitful
person
he
will
not
take
care
of
you
and
love
you
unless
you
speak
the
truth
sometimes
you
try
to
deceive
me
god
will
not
be
your
friend
if
you
deceive
any
one
and
now
go
to
your
mother
she
will
put
you
to
bed
lydia
made
a
curtsey
and
said
she
went
to
weston
and
bade
her
too
then
turning
toward
alice
she
gazed
wonderingly
at
her
pale
face
is
you
got
de
headache
now
miss
alice
not
much
said
alice
gently
good
night
miss
said
lydia
with
another
curtesy
and
she
softly
left
the
room
oh
mammy
she
said
as
she
entered
her
mother
cabin
miss
janet
say
if
i
a
good
child
god
will
love
me
much
as
he
loves
miss
alice
if
i
is
black
miss
alice
is
so
white
you
never
see
her
look
as
white
as
she
do
weston
alighted
from
his
horse
and
hurried
to
the
have
you
waited
tea
for
me
he
said
why
did
you
do
so
alice
darling
is
your
head
better
a
great
deal
uncle
said
alice
have
you
had
a
pleasant
ride
yes
but
my
child
you
look
very
sick
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
anna
did
you
send
for
the
doctor
no
alice
objected
so
but
you
must
send
for
him
i
am
sure
she
is
seriously
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
but
a
headache
said
alice
after
tea
i
will
go
to
bed
and
will
be
well
in
the
morning
god
grant
you
may
my
sweet
one
what
has
come
over
you
tea
is
ready
said
cousin
janet
let
us
go
in
to
it
and
then
have
prayers
and
all
go
to
bed
early
why
cousin
weston
you
are
getting
quite
dissipated
in
your
old
age
coming
home
to
tea
at
this
hour
i
suppose
i
shall
begin
such
practices
next
miss
janet
suggestion
of
retiring
early
was
followed
phillis
came
in
to
see
how
alice
head
was
and
recommended
brown
paper
and
vinegar
she
made
no
comment
on
her
appearance
but
did
not
wonder
that
lydia
was
struck
with
the
expression
of
her
countenance
there
was
an
uneasiness
that
was
foreign
to
it
not
merely
had
the
glow
of
health
departed
there
was
something
in
its
place
strange
there
it
was
like
the
storm
passing
over
the
beautiful
lake
the
outline
of
rock
and
tree
and
surface
is
to
be
seen
but
its
tranquil
beauty
is
gone
and
darkness
and
gloom
are
resting
where
has
been
the
home
of
light
and
love
and
beauty
alice
undressed
and
went
to
bed
her
mother
raised
all
the
windows
put
out
the
candle
and
laid
down
beside
her
hoping
that
she
would
fall
asleep
she
did
not
converse
but
alice
after
a
few
minutes
called
her
what
is
it
alice
did
you
hear
what
cousin
janet
said
to
lydia
mother
god
hates
those
who
deceive
why
think
of
that
now
my
love
because
it
refers
to
me
she
did
not
mean
it
for
me
but
it
came
home
to
my
heart
to
heart
that
has
always
been
truth
and
candor
itself
try
and
banish
such
thoughts
if
you
were
well
fancies
like
these
would
not
affect
you
they
are
not
fancies
they
are
realities
said
alice
she
sighed
and
continued
am
i
not
deceiving
the
kind
protector
and
friend
of
my
childhood
oh
mother
if
he
knew
all
how
little
would
he
love
me
and
arthur
can
it
be
right
for
me
to
be
engaged
to
him
and
to
deceive
him
too
dear
alice
how
often
have
we
talked
about
this
and
hoped
you
were
satisfied
as
to
the
propriety
of
being
silent
on
the
subject
at
present
your
uncle
health
is
very
feeble
he
is
subject
to
sudden
and
alarming
attacks
of
sickness
and
easily
thrown
into
a
state
of
agitation
that
endangers
his
life
would
you
run
such
a
risk
what
a
grief
would
it
be
to
him
to
know
that
the
hopes
of
years
were
to
be
destroyed
and
by
one
whom
he
had
nursed
in
his
own
bosom
as
a
child
poor
arthur
too
away
from
home
so
long
trusting
you
with
such
confidence
looking
forward
with
delight
to
the
time
of
his
return
could
you
bear
thus
to
dash
his
dearest
prospects
to
the
earth
but
he
must
know
it
mother
i
could
not
marry
him
with
a
lie
in
my
right
hand
it
will
not
be
so
alice
you
can
not
help
loving
arthur
above
all
men
when
you
are
with
him
so
noble
so
generous
so
gifted
with
all
that
is
calculated
to
inspire
affection
you
will
wonder
your
heart
has
ever
wavered
but
it
has
said
alice
and
he
must
know
all
of
course
said
weston
nothing
would
justify
your
having
any
reserve
with
him
but
this
is
not
the
time
for
explanation
if
i
believed
that
you
really
and
truly
loved
walter
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
forget
him
and
return
arthur
affection
if
i
thought
you
could
not
one
day
regard
arthur
as
he
deserves
i
would
not
wish
you
to
remain
silent
for
a
day
it
would
be
an
injustice
and
a
sin
to
do
so
yet
i
feel
assured
that
there
is
no
such
danger
a
woman
alice
rarely
marries
her
first
love
and
it
is
well
that
it
is
so
her
feelings
rather
than
her
judgment
are
then
enlisted
and
both
should
be
exercised
when
so
fearful
a
thing
as
marriage
is
concerned
you
have
been
a
great
deal
with
walter
and
have
always
regarded
him
tenderly
more
so
of
late
because
the
feelings
strengthen
with
time
and
situation
is
such
as
to
enlist
all
your
sympathies
his
fascinating
appearance
and
interesting
qualities
have
charmed
your
affections
you
see
him
casting
from
him
the
best
friends
he
has
ever
had
because
he
feels
condemned
of
ingratitude
in
their
society
he
is
going
forth
on
the
voyage
of
life
alone
you
weep
as
any
sister
would
to
see
him
thus
i
do
not
blame
him
for
loving
you
but
i
do
censure
him
in
the
highest
degree
for
endeavoring
to
win
more
than
a
sister
regard
from
you
in
return
it
was
selfish
and
dishonorable
more
than
all
i
blame
myself
for
not
foreseeing
this
you
said
yesterday
you
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
arthur
you
do
not
know
your
own
heart
many
a
woman
does
not
until
time
has
been
her
teacher
let
it
be
yours
cousin
janet
has
thus
advised
you
be
guided
by
us
and
leave
this
thing
to
rest
for
a
while
you
will
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
having
done
so
would
you
leave
me
for
walter
alice
no
mother
how
could
you
ask
me
then
trust
me
i
would
not
answer
for
your
uncle
safety
were
we
to
speak
to
him
on
this
subject
how
cruel
to
pain
him
when
a
few
months
may
restore
us
to
the
hopes
and
happiness
which
have
been
ours
do
what
is
right
and
leave
the
future
to
god
but
how
can
i
write
to
arthur
when
i
know
i
am
not
treating
him
as
i
would
wish
him
to
treat
me
write
as
you
always
have
your
letters
have
never
been
very
sentimental
arthur
says
you
write
on
all
subjects
but
the
one
nearest
his
heart
if
you
had
loved
him
as
i
thought
you
did
you
never
would
have
allowed
another
to
usurp
his
place
but
we
can
not
help
the
past
now
dear
child
compose
yourself
i
am
fatigued
but
can
not
sleep
until
you
do
alice
restless
for
a
while
at
last
fell
asleep
but
it
was
not
the
rest
that
brings
refreshment
and
repose
her
mother
watched
her
as
with
her
hand
now
pressed
on
her
brow
now
thrown
on
the
pillow
she
slept
her
mind
overtaxed
tried
even
in
sleep
to
release
itself
of
its
burden
the
wish
to
please
and
the
effort
to
do
right
was
too
much
for
her
sensitive
frame
it
was
like
the
traveler
unaccustomed
to
fatigue
and
change
forced
to
commence
a
journey
unassured
of
his
way
and
ignorant
of
his
destination
her
mother
watched
her
a
deep
hue
was
settled
under
her
eyelashes
the
veins
in
her
temple
were
fearfully
distinct
and
a
small
crimson
spot
rested
on
her
cheek
she
watched
her
by
the
moonlight
that
glanced
over
every
part
of
the
room
she
listened
to
her
heavy
breathing
and
lightly
touched
her
dry
and
crimson
lips
she
stroked
the
long
luxuriant
curls
that
appeared
to
her
darker
than
they
ever
had
before
she
closed
the
nearest
window
lest
there
should
be
something
borne
on
the
breath
of
night
to
disturb
the
rest
of
the
beloved
one
but
mother
it
will
not
do
the
curse
of
god
is
still
abroad
in
the
world
the
curse
on
sin
it
falls
like
a
blighting
dew
on
the
loveliest
and
dearest
to
our
hearts
it
is
by
our
side
and
in
our
path
it
is
among
the
gay
the
rich
the
proud
and
the
gifted
of
the
earth
among
the
poor
the
despised
the
desolate
and
forsaken
it
darkens
the
way
of
the
monarch
and
the
cottager
of
the
maiden
and
the
mother
of
the
master
and
the
slave
alas
since
it
poisoned
the
flowers
in
eden
and
turned
the
children
of
god
from
its
fair
walks
it
is
abroad
in
the
world
the
curse
of
god
on
sin
there
is
a
blessing
too
within
the
reach
of
all
he
who
bore
the
curse
secured
the
blessing
son
of
god
teach
us
to
be
like
thee
give
us
of
thy
spirit
that
we
may
soften
to
each
other
the
inevitable
ills
of
life
prepare
us
for
that
condition
to
which
we
may
aspire
for
that
assembly
where
will
be
united
the
redeemed
of
all
the
earth
where
will
rejoice
forever
in
thy
presence
those
of
all
ages
and
climes
who
looked
up
from
the
shadow
of
the
curse
to
the
blessing
which
thou
didst
obtain
with
thy
latest
sigh
on
calvary
chapter
xiv
after
phillis
left
weston
room
she
was
on
her
way
to
her
cabin
when
she
noticed
aunt
peggy
sitting
alone
at
the
door
she
was
rather
a
homebody
yet
she
reproached
herself
with
having
neglected
poor
old
peggy
when
she
saw
her
looking
so
desolate
and
dejected
she
thought
to
pay
her
a
visit
and
bidding
her
good
evening
sat
down
on
the
time
old
people
were
in
bed
aunt
peggy
said
she
what
are
you
settin
up
for
all
by
yourself
who

said
aunt
peggy

country

phillis
if

aunt

aunt
peggy
said
phillis
why
did
you
let
me
know
you
was
well
aint

i
tell
you
said
aunt
peggy
angrily
nothin
the
matter
wid
me
you
think
there
nothin
bad
about
what
comes
to
me
phillis
was
astonished
at
her
words
and
manner
and
looked
at
her
intently
most
of
the
servants
on
the
plantation
stood
in
awe
of
aunt
peggy
her
having
been
brought
from
africa
and
the
many
wonders
she
had
seen
there
her
gloomy
fitful
temper
her
tall
frame
and
long
skinny
hands
and
arms
her
haughty
countenance
and
mass
of
bushy
white
hair
phillis
did
not
wonder
most
people
were
afraid
of
her
besides
peggy
was
thought
to
have
the
power
of
foresight
in
her
old
age
the
servants
considered
her
a
sort
of
witch
and
deprecated
her
displeasure
phillis
had
too
much
sense
for
this
yet
there
was
one
thing
that
she
had
often
wondered
at
that
was
that
aunt
peggy
cared
nothing
about
religion
when
employed
in
the
family
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
sometimes
to
church
since
she
had
been
old
and
left
to
follow
her
own
wishes
she
had
never
gone
miss
janet
frequently
read
the
bible
and
explained
it
to
her
alice
seated
on
a
low
stool
by
the
old
woman
side
read
to
her
scenes
in
the
life
of
christ
upon
which
servants
love
to
dwell
but
as
far
as
they
could
judge
there
were
no
good
impressions
left
on
her
mind
she
never
objected
but
she
gave
them
no
encouragement
this
phillis
had
often
thought
of
and
now
as
she
sat
with
her
it
occurred
to
her
with
overwhelming
force
death
about
somewhere
said
aunt
peggy
i
ca
see
him
but
i
feels
him
there
somefin
here
belongs
to
him
he
wants
it
and
he
gwine
to
have
it
to
me
said
phillis
death
always
about
its
well
to
be
ready
for
him
when

aunt
peggy

the
churchyard
yonder

phillis
young
people

as
well
as

but
no
harm
to
be
ready
you
know
aunt
peggy
we
aint
never
ready
till
our
sins

repented
of
and
our
souls
is
washed
in
the
blood
of
jesus

to
think

and

arter

she

about
miss
alice
when
she
always
coming
to
you
bringing
you
something
and
trying
to
do
something
for
you
said
phillis
you
might
as
well
sit
here
and
talk
bad
of
one
of
the
angels
above

talking

of
her
said
aunt
peggy
aint
wishin

no

she
as
good
as
any
of
but
it
her
arter
not
me
look
here
at
my
arms
stronger
than
yourn
and
she
held
out
her
sinewy
tough
arm
grasping
her
cane
to
go
in
the
house
phillis
saw
she
was
not
wanted
there
and
looking
in
to
be
assured
that
nancy
aunt
peggy
who
lived
with
her
to
take
care
of
her
was
there
went
home
and
thought
to
go
to
bed
but
she
found
no
disposition
to
sleep
within
her
accustomed
as
she
was
to
aunt
fault
finding
and
her
strange
way
of
talking
she
was
particularly
impressed
with
it
was
so
strange
phillis
thought
that
she
should
have
talked
about
being
stolen
away
from
guinea
and
things
that
happened
almost
a
hundred
years
ago
then
her
saying
so
often
that
death
was
about
phillis
was
no
more
nervous
than
her
iron
but
now
she
could
not
feel
right
she
sat
down
by
the
door
and
tried
to
compose
herself
every
one
on
the
plantation
was
quiet
it
seemed
to
her
the
night
got
brighter
and
brighter
and
the
heavens
more
crowded
with
stars
than
she
had
ever
seen
them
she
looked
at
her
children
to
see
if
they
all
were
well
and
then
gave
a
glance
at
old
bacchus
who
was
snoring
loud
enough
to
wake
the
dead
she
shook
him
heartily
and
told
him
to
hush
his
clatter
but
she
might
as
well
have
told
a
pounder
to
go
off
without
making
a
noise
then
she
sat
down
again
and
looked
at
alice
window
and
could
not
avoid
seeing
aunt
peggy
house
when
she
turned
in
that
direction
thus
she
was
reminded
of
her
saying
death
was
about
and
arter
somefin
wondering
what
had
come
over
her
she
shut
the
door
and
laid
down
without
undressing
herself
she
slept
heavily
for
several
hours
and
waked
with
the
thought
of
aunt
peggy
strange
talk
pressing
upon
her
she
determined
not
to
go
to
bed
again
but
opened
the
door
and
fixed
the
old
chair
within
it
bacchus
always
a
very
early
riser
except
on
sunday
was
still
asleep
having
had
some
sharp
twinges
of
the
rheumatism
the
day
before
phillis
hoped
he
might
sleep
them
off
her
own
mind
was
still
burdened
with
an
unaccountable
weight
she
was
glad
to
see
the
dawning
of
another
blue
day
before
her
towered
in
their
majestic
glory
miss
janet
favorite
mountains
yet
were
the
peaks
alone
distinctly
visible
the
twilight
only
strong
enough
to
disclose
the
mass
of
heavy
fog
that
enveloped
them
the
stars
had
nearly
all
disappeared
those
that
lingered
were
sadly
paling
away
how
solemn
was
the
stillness
she
thought
of
the
words
of
jacob
surely
god
is
here
the
clouds
were
flying
swiftly
beneath
the
arch
of
heaven
as
if
from
god
presence
many
thoughts
were
suggested
to
her
by
the
grandeur
of
the
scene
for
my
reader
must
remember
that
an
admiration
of
the
glories
of
nature
is
not
unfrequently
a
characteristic
of
an
uneducated
mind
many
verses
of
scripture
occurred
to
her
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
unto
the
going
down
of
the
same
the
lord
name
be
praised
the
lord
is
high
above
all
nations
and
his
glory
above
the
heavens
who
is
like
unto
the
lord
our
god
who
dwelleth
on
high
who
humbleth
himself
to
behold
the
things
that
are
in
heaven
and
in
the
earth
the
soul
of
the
rejoiced
in
the
lord
her
maker
and
her
redeemer
gradually
a
soft
light
arose
above
the
mountains
the
fog
became
transparent
through
its
influence
a
red
hue
gilded
the
top
of
the
mist
and
slowly
descended
toward
it
as
it
sank
away
all
the
shadows
of
the
night
were
disappearing
at
the
command
once
given
let
there
be
light
and
at
the
birth
of
every
day
phillis
heart
warmed
with
gratitude
to
god
who
had
given
to
her
a
knowledge
of
himself
she
thought
of
her
many
mercies
her
health
her
comforts
and
the
comparative
happiness
of
each
member
of
her
family
of
the
kindness
of
her
master
and
the
ladies
all
these
considerations
affected
her
as
they
never
had
before
for
gratitude
and
love
to
god
ever
inspires
us
with
love
and
kindness
to
our
fellow
creatures
her
thoughts
returned
to
alice
but
all
superstitious
dread
was
gone
aunt
peggy
strange
wanderings
no
longer
oppressed
her
her
mind
was
in
its
usual
healthy
state
the
good
lord
is
above
us
all
she
said
and
miss
alice
is
one
of
his
children
she
saw
the
house
door
open
and
william
coming
toward
her
on
his
way
to
the
stable
it
was
without
any
agitation
that
she
asked
what
was
the
matter
miss
alice
is
very
sick
said
william
and
i
am
going
for
the
doctor
i
am
glad
i
happened
to
be
here
said
phillis
may
be
they
want
me
you
better
not
go
in
now
said
william
for
she
asleep
miss
anna
told
me
to
walk
very
easy
for
she
would
not
have
her
waked
for
all
the
world
so
phillis
seeing
aunt
peggy
door
open
thought
she
would
step
over
and
find
out
if
the
old
lady
had
slept
off
her
notions
aunt
peggy
cabin
had
two
rooms
in
one
of
which
she
and
her
granddaughter
slept
in
the
other
nancy
cooked
and
washed
and
occupied
herself
with
various
little
matters
nancy
had
been
up
a
short
time
and
was
mixing
some
indian
bread
for
their
breakfast
she
looked
surprised
at
having
so
early
a
visitor
how
is
your
grandmother
child
said
phillis
did
she
sleep
well
mighty
well
said
nancy
she
aint
coughed
at
all
as
i
heard
since
she
went
to
bed
well
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
phillis
for
i
thought
she
was
going
to
be
sick
she
was
so
curious
last
night
she
did
complain
any
way
said
nancy
going
on
with
her
breadmaking
so
phillis
got
up
to
go
home
as
she
passed
the
door
of
the
other
room
she
could
but
stop
to
look
in
at
the
hard
iron
features
of
the
old
creature
as
she
lay
in
slumber
her
long
black
face
contrasted
most
remarkably
with
the
white
pillow
on
which
it
was
supported
her
hair
making
her
head
look
double
its
actual
size
standing
off
from
her
ears
and
head
one
long
black
arm
lay
extended
the
hand
holding
to
the
side
of
the
bed
something
impelled
phillis
to
approach
at
first
she
thought
of
her
grumbling
disposition
her
bitter
resentment
for
injuries
most
of
which
were
fanciful
her
uncompromising
dislike
to
the
servants
on
the
plantation
she
almost
got
angry
when
she
thought
the
more
you
do
for
her
the
more
she
complains
then
she
recalled
her
talk
the
night
before
of
her
being
torn
away
from
her
mother
and
sold
off
tied
to
a
dead
woman
and
the
storm
and
the
sharks
a
feeling
of
the
sincerest
pity
took
the
place
of
her
first
reflections
and
well
they
did
for
the
next
idea
phillis
knees
knocked
together
and
her
heart
beat
audibly
for
what
was
before
her
what
but
death
with
all
his
grimness
and
despair
looking
forth
from
the
white
balls
that
were
only
partially
covered
with
the
dark
lids
showing
his
power
in
the
cold
hands
whose
unyielding
grasp
had
closed
in
the
struggle
with
him
setting
his
seal
on
brow
and
lips
lengthening
the
extended
form
that
never
would
rouse
itself
from
the
position
in
which
the
mighty
conqueror
had
left
it
when
he
knew
his
victory
was
accomplished
what
but
death
indeed
for
the
heart
and
the
pulse
were
still
forever
and
the
life
that
had
once
regulated
their
beatings
had
gone
back
to
the
giver
of
life
the
two
slave
women
were
alone
together
she
who
had
been
had
gone
with
all
her
years
her
wrongs
and
her
sins
to
answer
at
the
bar
of
her
maker
the
fierce
and
bitter
contest
with
life
the
mysterious
curse
the
dealings
of
a
god
with
the
children
of
men
think
of
it
oh
christian
as
you
gaze
upon
her
the
other
slave
woman
is
with
the
dead
she
is
trembling
as
in
the
presence
of
god
she
knows
he
is
everywhere
even
in
the
room
of
death
is
redeemed
from
the
slavery
of
sin
and
her
regenerate
soul
looks
forward
to
the
rest
that
remaineth
to
the
people
of
god
she
submits
herself
to
an
earthly
master
knowing
that
the
dispensation
of
god
has
placed
her
in
a
state
of
servitude
yet
she
trusts
in
a
heavenly
master
with
childlike
faith
and
says
may
i
be
ready
when
he
comes
and
calls
for
me
phillis
was
perfectly
when
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
nancy
she
said
did
you
think
it
was
strange
your
grandmother
slept
so
quiet
and
laid
so
late
this
morning
she
always
gets
up
so
early
i
did
think
nothin
about
it
said
nancy
for
i
was
myself
well
there
no
use
putting
it
off
said
phillis
i
might
as
well
tell
you
first
as
last
she
dead
dead
what
do
you
mean
said
nancy
i
mean
she
dead
said
phillis
and
cold
and
very
likely
has
been
so
for
most
of
the
night
do
be
frightened
and
make
a
noise
for
miss
alice
is
very
sick
and
you
so
near
the
house
nancy
went
with
her
to
the
other
room
a
child
would
have
known
there
was
no
mistake
about
death
being
there
if
the
idea
had
been
suggested
to
it
nancy
was
in
a
moment
satisfied
that
such
was
the
case
but
she
shed
very
few
tears
she
was
quite
worn
out
taking
care
of
the
old
woman
and
the
other
servants
were
not
willing
to
take
their
turns
they
said
they
could
abide
the
cross
old
thing
phillis
went
home
for
a
few
moments
and
returned
to
perform
the
last
offices
all
was
order
and
neatness
under
her
superintendence
and
they
who
avoided
the
sight
of
aunt
peggy
when
alive
stood
with
a
solemn
awe
beside
her
and
gazed
now
that
she
was
dead
all
but
the
children
aunt
peggy
was
dead
she
who
had
been
a
kind
of
scarecrow
in
life
how
terrible
was
the
thought
of
her
now
the
severest
threat
to
an
unruly
child
was
i
will
give
you
to
aunt
peggy
and
let
her
keep
you
but
to
think
of
aunt
peggy
in
connection
with
darkness
and
silence
and
the
grave
was
dreadful
indeed
all
day
the
thought
of
her
kept
them
awed
and
quiet
but
as
evening
drew
on
they
crept
close
to
their
mothers
side
turning
from
every
shadow
lest
she
should
come
forth
from
it
little
lydia
deprived
of
miss
janet
company
in
consequence
of
alice
sickness
listened
to
the
pervading
subject
of
conversation
all
day
and
at
night
dreamed
that
the
old
woman
had
carried
her
off
to
the
top
of
the
highest
of
the
mountains
that
stood
before
them
and
there
she
sat
scowling
upon
her
and
there
they
were
to
be
forever
when
the
next
afternoon
had
come
and
the
body
was
buried
and
all
had
returned
from
the
funeral
phillis
locked
up
the
vacant
cabin
nancy
was
to
be
employed
in
the
house
and
sleep
in
the
servants
wing
then
phillis
realized
that
death
had
been
there
and
she
remembered
once
more
aunt
peggy
words
he
arter
somefin
wants
it
and
he
gwine
to
have
it
but
it
ai
me
there
is
one
thing
concerning
death
in
which
we
are
apt
to
be
sceptical
and
that
is
does
he
want
me
chapter
xv
aunt
peggy
funeral
was
conducted
quietly
but
with
that
respect
to
the
dead
which
is
universal
on
southern
plantations
there
was
no
hurry
no
confusion
two
young
women
remained
with
the
corpse
during
the
night
preceding
the
burial
the
servants
throughout
the
plantation
had
holiday
that
they
might
attend
at
weston
request
the
clergyman
of
the
episcopal
church
in
x
read
the
service
for
the
dead
he
addressed
the
servants
in
a
solemn
and
appropriate
manner
weston
was
one
of
the
audience
alice
sickness
had
become
serious
miss
janet
and
her
mother
were
detained
with
her
the
negroes
sung
one
of
their
favorite
hymns
life
is
the
time
to
serve
the
lord
their
fine
voices
blending
in
perfect
harmony
caldwell
took
for
his
text
the
verse
of
the
chapter
of
thessalonians
that
ye
would
walk
worthy
of
god
who
hath
called
you
unto
his
kingdom
and
his
glory
he
explained
to
them
in
the
most
affectionate
and
beautiful
manner
that
were
called
unto
the
kingdom
and
glory
of
christ
he
dwelt
on
the
glories
of
that
kingdom
as
existing
in
the
heart
of
the
believer
inciting
him
to
a
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
of
life
as
in
the
world
promoting
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
all
mankind
and
completed
in
heaven
where
will
be
the
consummation
of
all
the
glorious
things
that
the
humble
believer
in
jesus
has
enjoyed
by
faith
while
surrounded
by
the
temptations
and
enduring
the
trials
of
the
world
he
told
them
were
all
called
christ
died
for
all
every
human
being
that
had
heard
of
jesus
and
his
atonement
was
called
unto
salvation
he
dwelt
on
the
efficacy
of
that
atonement
on
the
solemn
occasion
when
it
was
made
on
the
perfect
peace
and
reconciliation
of
the
believer
he
spoke
of
the
will
of
god
which
had
placed
them
in
a
condition
of
bondage
to
an
earthly
master
who
had
given
them
equal
hope
of
eternal
redemption
with
that
master
he
reminded
them
that
christ
had
chosen
his
lot
among
the
poor
of
this
world
that
he
had
refused
all
earthly
honor
and
advantage
he
charged
them
to
profit
by
the
present
occasion
to
bring
home
to
their
hearts
the
unwelcome
truth
that
death
was
inevitable
he
pointed
to
the
coffin
that
contained
the
remains
of
one
who
had
attained
so
great
an
age
as
to
make
her
an
object
of
wonder
in
the
neighborhood
yet
her
time
had
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
there
was
no
sickness
no
sudden
failing
nothing
unusual
in
her
appearance
to
intimate
the
presence
of
death
god
had
given
her
a
long
time
of
health
to
prepare
for
the
great
change
he
had
given
her
every
opportunity
to
repent
and
he
had
called
her
to
her
account
he
charged
them
to
make
their
preparation
now
closing
by
bringing
before
their
minds
that
great
day
when
the
judge
of
the
earth
would
summon
before
him
every
soul
he
had
made
none
could
escape
his
eye
the
king
and
his
subject
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
strong
and
the
weak
the
learned
and
the
ignorant
the
white
and
the
colored
the
master
and
his
slave
each
to
render
his
or
her
account
for
the
deeds
done
in
the
body
the
servants
were
extremely
attentive
listening
with
breathless
interest
as
he
enlarged
upon
the
awful
events
of
the
judgment
many
a
tear
fell
many
a
heart
throbbed
many
a
soul
stretched
forth
her
wings
toward
the
kingdom
and
glory
which
had
been
the
clergyman
theme
after
he
concluded
their
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
preparation
to
remove
the
body
to
its
final
resting
place
the
face
was
looked
upon
then
covered
the
coffin
lid
screwed
down
strong
arms
lifting
and
bearing
it
to
the
bier
nancy
and
isaac
her
only
relatives
were
near
the
coffin
and
weston
and
the
clergyman
followed
them
the
rest
formed
in
long
procession
with
measured
step
and
appropriate
thought
they
passed
their
cabins
toward
the
place
used
for
the
interment
of
the
slaves
on
the
plantation
they
had
gone
a
little
way
when
a
full
rich
female
voice
gently
broke
in
upon
the
stillness
it
was
phillis
though
the
first
line
was
sung
in
a
low
tone
every
one
heard
it
alas
and
did
my
saviour
bleed
they
joined
in
following
the
remains
of
their
and
commemorating
the
sufferings
of
one
who
became
as
a
servant
that
he
might
exalt
all
who
trust
in
him
it
might
be
there
was
little
hope
for
the
dead
but
not
less
sufficient
the
atonement
on
calvary
not
less
true
that
for
each
and
all
did
he
devote
that
sacred
head
that
for
pity
which
he
felt
for
all
he
hung
upon
the
tree
amazing
pity
grace
unknown
and
love
beyond
degree
while
the
voices
swept
through
the
air
a
tribute
of
lowly
hearts
ascended
to
god
they
had
now
reached
the
burial
ground
all
was
in
readiness
and
the
men
deposited
their
burden
in
the
earth
deep
and
solemn
thought
was
portrayed
on
every
face
music
had
softened
their
feelings
and
the
reflections
suggested
by
the
hymn
prepared
them
for
kind
sentiments
toward
the
dead
though
no
one
had
loved
her
in
life
the
first
hard
clod
that
rattled
on
the
coffin
opened
the
fountain
of
their
tears
she
who
had
been
the
object
of
their
aversion
was
gone
from
them
forever
they
could
not
now
show
her
any
kindness
how
many
a
heart
reproached
itself
with
a
sneering
word
hasty
anger
and
disdainful
laugh
but
what
was
she
now
dust
and
ashes
they
wept
as
they
saw
her
hidden
from
their
eyes
turning
from
the
grave
with
a
better
sense
of
their
duties
reader
it
is
well
for
the
soul
to
ponder
on
the
great
mystery
death
is
there
not
a
charm
in
it
the
mystery
of
so
many
opposite
memories
the
strange
union
of
adverse
ideas
the
young
the
old
the
gay
the
proud
the
beautiful
the
poor
and
the
sorrowful
silence
darkness
repose
happiness
woe
heaven
and
hell
oh
they
should
come
now
with
a
startling
solemnity
upon
us
all
for
while
i
write
the
solemn
tolling
of
the
bells
warns
me
of
a
nation
grief
it
calls
to
millions
its
sad
resonance
is
echoed
in
every
heart
henry
clay
is
dead
well
may
the
words
pass
from
lip
to
lip
in
the
thronged
street
the
child
repeats
it
with
a
dim
consciousness
of
some
great
woe
it
knows
not
to
its
full
extent
the
burden
of
the
words
it
utters
the
youth
passes
along
the
solemn
sentence
there
is
a
throb
in
his
energetic
heart
for
he
has
seen
the
enfeebled
form
of
the
statesman
as
it
glided
among
the
multitude
and
has
heard
his
voice
raised
for
his
country
good
he
is
assured
that
the
heart
that
has
ceased
to
beat
glowed
with
all
that
was
great
and
noble
the
politician
utters
too
the
sound
henry
clay
is
dead
well
may
he
bare
his
breast
and
say
for
is
my
voice
raised
where
his
has
been
heard
is
it
for
my
country
or
for
my
party

myself

his

no

his

his
energy
his
calmness
his
constant
devotion
to
the
interests
of
his
country
look
above
all
at
his
patience
his
humility
as
the
great
scenes
of
life
were
receding
from
his
view
and
futurity
was
opening
before
him

of
the
childlike
submission
with
which
he
bowed
to
the
will
that
ordained
for
him
a
protracted
and

said
to
a

where
i
want
to
go
to
the
feet
of
jesus
listen
to
the
simplicity
with
which
he
commended
his
body
to
his
friends
and
his
spirit
through
faith
in

christ
to
his
god
regard
him
in
all
his
varied
relations
of

and

if
the
sigh
that
is
now
rending
the

well
merited

reader
thoughts
of
death
are
useful
to
us
all
whether
it
be
by
the
grave
of
the
poor
and
humble
or
when
listening
to
the
tolling
of
the
bell

announces
to
all
that
one
who
was
mighty
in
the
land
has
been
summoned

weston
and
phillis
returned
to
the
from
the
funeral
fever
was
doing
its
work
with
the
fair
being
the
beloved
of
many
hearts
who
was
unconscious
of
aught
that
was
passing
around
her
there
was
a
startling
light
from
the
depths
of
her
blue
eyes
their
natural
softness
of
expression
gone
the
crimson
glow
had
flushed
into
a
hectic
the
hot
breath
from
her
parted
lips
was
drying
away
their
moisture
the
rich
mournful
tones
of
her
voice
echoed
in
sad
wailing
through
the
chambers
it
constantly
and
plaintively
said
mother
though
that
mother
answered
in
vain
to
its
appeal
the
air
circulated
through
the
room
bearing
the
odor
of
the
woods
but
for
her
it
had
no
reviving
power
it
could
not
stay
the
beatings
of
her
pulse
nor
relieve
the
oppression
of
her
panting
bosom
oh
what
beauty
was
about
that
bed
of
sickness
the
perfect
shape
of
every
feature
the
graceful
turn
of
the
head
the
luxuriant
auburn
hair
the
contour
of
her
rounded
limbs
there
was
no
vacancy
in
her
face
alas
visions
of
sorrow
were
passing
in
her
mind
a
sad
intelligence
was
expressed
in
every
glance
but
not
to
the
objects
about
her
the
soul
subdued
by
the
suffering
of
its
tenement
was
wandering
afar
off
perchance
endeavoring
to
dive
into
the
future
perchance
essaying
to
forget
the
past
what
says
that
vision
of
languishing
and
loveliness
to
the
old
man
whose
eyes
are
fixed
in
grief
upon
it
thou
seest
o
christian
the
uselessness
of
laying
up
thy
treasures
here
where
are
now
the
hopes
of
half
thy
lifetime
where
the
consummation
of
all
thy
anxious
plans
she
who
has
been
like
an
angel
by
thy
side
how
wearily
throbs
her
young
heart
will
she
perpetuate
the
name
of
thy
race
will
she
close
thine
eyes
with
her
loving
hand
will
she
drop
upon
thy
breast
a
daughter
tear
what
does
the
vision
say
to
thee
oh
aged
woman
there
is
still
more
for
thee
to
do
more
for
thee
to
suffer
it
is
not
yet
enough
of
this
mortal
strife
thou
mayest
again
see
a
fair
flower
crushed
by
the
rude
wind
of
death
perchance
she
may
precede
thee
to
open
for
thine
entrance
the
eternal
gates
and
what
to
thee
thou
faithful
servant
there
are
tears
in
thine
eye
and
for
me
for
me
whom
thou
thoughtest
above
a
touch
of
aught
that
could
bring
sorrow
or
pain
thou
seest
not
alone
on
thy
doomed
race
rests
a
curse
the
fierce
anger
of
god
denounced
against
sin
the
falls
upon
his
dearest
children
i
must
like
you
abide
by
god
dealing
with
the
children
of
men
but
we
shall
be
redeemed
what
to
thee
oh
mother
thou
canst
not
read
the
interpretation
a
cloud
of
darkness
sweeps
by
thy
soul
vision
will
it
pass
or
will
it
rest
upon
thee
forever
yet
the
voice
of
god
speaks
to
each
one
faintly
it
may
be
to
the
mother
but
even
to
her
there
is
a
rainbow
of
hope
in
the
deluge
of
her
sorrow
she
sees
death
in
the
multitude
that
passes
her
sight
but
there
is
another
there
one
whose
form
is
like
unto
the
son
of
god
she
remembers
how
he
wept
over
lazarus
and
raised
him
from
the
dead
oh
what
comfort
to
place
her
case
in
his
pitying
bosom
many
were
the
friends
who
wept
and
hoped
and
prayed
with
them
full
of
grief
were
the
affectionate
servants
but
most
of
all
phillis
it
was
useless
to
try
and
persuade
her
to
take
her
usual
rest
to
remind
her
of
her
children
and
her
cares
to
offer
her
the
choice
morsel
to
tempt
her
appetite
the
refreshing
drink
she
so
much
required
she
wanted
nothing
but
to
weep
with
those
who
wept
nor
rest
nor
food
nor
refreshing
it
is
universal
the
consideration
that
is
shown
to
the
servants
at
the
south
as
regards
their
times
of
eating
and
of
rest
whatever
may
have
occurred
whatever
fatigue
the
different
members
of
the
family
may
feel
obliged
to
undergo
a
servant
is
rarely
called
upon
for
extra
attendance
in
the
northern
country
the
whole
labor
of
a
family
is
frequently
performed
by
one
female
while
five
or
six
will
do
the
same
amount
of
work
in
the
south
a
servant
at
the
south
is
rarely
called
upon
at
night
only
in
cases
of
absolute
necessity
negroes
are
naturally
they
like
to
sit
up
late
at
night
in
winter
over
a
large
fire
nodding
and
bumping
their
heads
against
each
other
or
in
summer
out
of
doors
but
they
take
many
a
nap
before
they
can
get
courage
to
undress
and
go
regularly
to
bed
they
may
be
much
interested
in
a
conversation
going
on
but
it
is
no
violation
of
their
code
of
etiquette
to
smoke
themselves
to
sleep
while
listening
few
of
the
most
faithful
servants
can
keep
awake
well
enough
to
be
of
real
service
in
cases
of
sickness
there
is
a
feeling
among
their
owners
that
they
work
hard
during
the
day
and
should
be
allowed
more
rest
than
those
who
are
not
obliged
to
labor
do
not
disturb
servants
when
they
are
eating
is
the
frequent
charge
of
a
southern
mother
they
have
not
a
great
many
pleasures
within
their
reach
never
do
any
thing
that
will
lessen
their
comforts
in
the
slightest
degree
weston
even
in
her
own
deep
sorrow
was
not
unmindful
of
others
she
frequently
tried
to
induce
phillis
to
go
home
knowing
that
she
must
be
much
fatigued
i
can
not
feel
tired
phillis
a
mother
could
not
sleep
with
her
only
child
as
alice
is
i
do
not
require
the
rest
that
you
do
you
needs
it
more
miss
anna
though
you
do
think
so
now
i
can
take
care
of
myself
unless
you
drive
me
away
i
sha
go
until
god
will
be
done
for
life
or
death
miss
janet
often
laid
down
and
slept
for
an
hour
or
two
and
returned
refreshed
to
the
sick
chamber
her
voice
retained
its
cheerfulness
and
kept
weston
heart
from
failing
hope
on
anna
she
would
say
as
long
as
she
breathes
we
must
not
give
her
up
how
many
have
been
thought
entirely
gone
and
then
revived
we
must
hope
and
god
will
do
the
rest
this
hoping
on
was
one
great
cause
of
cousin
janet
usefulness
during
a
long
life
religion
and
reason
alike
demand
it
of
us
many
grand
and
noble
actions
have
been
done
in
the
world
that
never
could
have
been
accomplished
without
hoping
on
when
we
become
discouraged
how
heavy
the
task
before
us
it
is
like
drooping
the
eyes
and
feebly
putting
forth
the
hands
to
find
the
way
when
all
appears
to
us
darkness
but
let
the
eye
be
lifted
and
the
heart
hope
on
and
there
is
found
a
glimmering
of
light
which
enables
the
trembling
one
to
penetrate
the
gloom
alice
symptoms
had
been
so
violent
from
the
first
her
disease
had
progressed
so
rapidly
that
her
condition
was
almost
hopeless
ere
weston
thought
of
the
propriety
of
informing
arthur
of
her
condition
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
he
felt
convinced
that
he
ought
not
to
delay
he
knew
that
arthur
never
could
be
consoled
if
alice
his
dearly
loved
his
affianced
wife
should
die
without
his
having
the
consolation
of
a
parting
word
or
look
he
asked
cousin
janet
her
opinion
she
recalled
all
that
had
passed
previous
to
alice
illness
as
she
looked
into
weston
grieved
and
honest
face
the
question
suggested
itself
is
it
right
thus
to
keep
him
in
ignorance
she
only
wavered
a
moment
already
the
traces
of
agitation
caused
by
his
niece
illness
were
visible
in
his
flushed
face
and
nervous
frame
what
then
might
be
the
result
of
laying
before
him
a
subject
in
which
his
happiness
was
so
nearly
concerned
besides
she
felt
convinced
that
even
should
alice
improve
the
suffering
which
had
been
one
cause
of
her
sickness
might
be
renewed
with
double
force
if
suggested
by
arthur
presence
i
know
my
dear
cousin
she
said
it
will
be
a
terrible
grief
to
arthur
should
alice
be
taken
from
us
yet
i
think
you
had
better
not
write
lawton
says
that
a
very
short
time
must
decide
her
case
and
were
the
worst
we
fear
to
occur
arthur
could
not
reach
here
in
time
to
see
her
with
any
satisfaction
if
he
lose
her
it
will
probably
be
better
for
him
to
remember
her
in
health
and
beauty
weston
trembled
and
burst
into
tears
try
and
not
give
way
said
miss
janet
again
we
are
doing
all
we
can
we
must
hope
and
pray
i
feel
a
great
deal
of
hope
god
is
so
merciful
he
will
not
bring
this
stroke
upon
you
in
your
old
age
unless
it
is
necessary
why
do
you
judge
for
him
he
is
mighty
to
save
lord
on
high
is
mightier
than
the
noise
of
many
waters
yea
than
the
mighty
waves
of
the
sea
think
of
his
mercy
and
power
to
save
and
trust
in
him
in
these
most
trying
scenes
of
life
how
little
do
we
sympathize
with
the
physician
how
much
oppressed
he
must
feel
with
the
charge
upon
him
he
is
the
adviser
to
him
is
left
the
direction
of
the
potions
which
may
be
the
healing
medicine
or
the
deadly
poison
he
may
select
a
remedy
powerful
to
cure
he
may
prescribe
one
fatal
to
the
invalid
how
is
he
to
draw
the
nice
line
of
distinction
he
must
consider
the
disease
the
constitution
the
probable
causes
of
the
attack
his
reputation
is
at
stake
his
happiness
for
many
eyes
are
turned
to
him
to
read
an
opinion
he
may
not
choose
to
give
in
words
if
he
would
be
like
the
great
healer
he
thinks
not
only
of
the
bodily
sufferings
that
he
is
anxious
to
assuage
but
of
the
immortal
soul
on
the
verge
of
the
great
interview
deciding
its
eternal
destiny
he
trembles
to
think
should
he
fail
it
may
be
hurried
to
its
account
if
he
be
a
friend
how
do
the
ties
of
association
add
to
his
burden
here
is
one
whom
he
has
loved
whose
voice
he
is
accustomed
to
hear
shall
he
through
neglect
or
mismanagement
make
a
void
in
many
hearts
shall
he
from
want
of
skill
bring
weeping
and
desolation
to
a
house
where
health
and
joy
have
been
alice
was
very
dear
to
lawton
she
was
the
companion
of
his
daughters
he
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
her
as
one
of
them
he
was
untiring
in
his
attendance
but
from
the
first
had
feared
the
result
weston
had
concealed
nothing
from
him
she
knew
that
he
considered
a
physician
bound
in
honour
to
know
the
affairs
of
a
family
only
among
themselves
she
had
no
reserves
thus
giving
him
every
assistance
in
her
power
in
conducting
the
case
she
detailed
to
him
explicitly
all
that
might
have
contributed
to
produce
it
you
know
my
dear
madam
the
doctor
said
that
at
this
season
we
have
even
in
our
healthy
country
severe
fevers
alice
is
one
of
the
usual
nature
it
could
have
been
produced
by
natural
causes
we
can
not
say
it
may
be
that
the
circumstances
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
confide
to
me
have
had
a
bad
effect
upon
her
the
effort
to
do
right
and
the
fear
lest
she
should
err
may
have
strained
her
sensitive
mind
she
must
have
felt
much
distress
in
parting
with
walter
whom
she
has
always
loved
as
a
brother
you
have
only
done
your
duty
i
should
not
like
to
see
a
daughter
of
mine
interested
in
that
young
man
i
fear
he
inherits
his
violent
passions
yet
his
early
training
may
bring
the
promised
blessing
alice
has
that
sort
of
mind
that
is
always
influenced
by
what
is
passing
at
the
time
remember
what
a
child
she
was
when
arthur
left
there
are
no
more
broken
hearts
sometimes
they
bend
a
little
but
they
can
be
straightened
again
if
alice
gets
well
you
need
not
fear
the
future
though
you
know
i
disapprove
of
cousins
marrying
doctor
said
weston
i
know
you
have
not
given
her
up
i
never
give
anybody
up
said
the
doctor
who
will
say
what
god
intends
to
do
i
trust
she
will
struggle
through
many
a
storm
assails
the
fair
ship
on
her
first
voyage
over
the
seas
she
may
be
sadly
tossed
about
with
the
wind
and
waves
but
may
breast
it
gallantly
and
come
back
safe
after
all
we
must
do
what
we
can
and
hope
for
the
best
these
words
strengthened
the
mother
heart
to
watch
and
hope
the
doctor
laid
down
to
sleep
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
afternoon
cousin
janet
weston
and
phillis
kept
their
watch
in
silence
the
latter
gently
fanned
alice
who
lay
gazing
but
unconscious
now
looking
inquiringly
into
her
mother
face
now
closing
her
eyes
to
every
thing
there
was
no
tossing
or
excitement
about
her
was
over
her
cheek
was
pale
and
her
eyes
languid
and
faded
one
would
not
have
believed
to
have
looked
upon
her
how
high
the
fever
still
raged
suddenly
she
repeated
the
word
that
had
often
been
on
her
lips
mother
then
with
an
effort
to
raise
herself
she
sank
back
upon
her
pillow
exhausted
a
sorrowful
look
like
death
suffused
itself
over
her
countenance
ah
how
throbbed
those
hearts
was
the
dreaded
messenger
here
miss
anna
whispered
phillis
she
is
not
gone
her
pulse
is
no
lower
it
is
the
same
is
it
the
same
are
you
sure
said
weston
who
for
a
few
moments
had
been
unable
to
speak
or
even
to
place
her
finger
on
the
pulse
it
is
no
worse
if
you
believe
me
said
phillis
it
may
be
a
little
better
but
it
is
no
worse
had
i
not
better
wake
the
doctor
said
weston
who
hardly
knew
what
to
believe
miss
janet
gently
touched
the
wrist
of
the
invalid
do
not
wake
him
my
dear
phillis
is
right
in
saying
she
is
no
worse
it
was
a
fainting
which
is
passing
away
see
she
looks
as
usual
give
her
the
medicine
it
is
time
and
leave
her
quiet
the
doctor
may
be
disturbed
the
night
had
passed
and
the
morning
was
just
visible
as
symptoms
of
the
same
nature
affected
the
patient
lawton
had
seen
her
very
late
at
night
and
had
requested
them
to
awaken
him
should
there
be
any
change
in
her
appearance
or
condition
oh
how
these
anxious
hearts
feared
and
hoped
through
this
night
what
might
it
bring
forth
joy
or
endless
weeping
this
dread
crisis
past
and
what
would
be
the
result
doctor
said
phillis
gently
awaking
him
i
sorry
to
disturb
you
miss
alice
has
had
another
little
turn
and
you
better
see
her
how
is
her
pulse
said
the
doctor
quickly
is
it
failing
to
me
not
sir
but
you
can
see
they
went
to
the
room
and
the
doctor
took
alice
small
wrist
and
lightly
felt
her
pulse
then
did
the
mother
watch
his
face
to
see
its
writing
what
was
there
nothing
but
deep
attention
the
wrist
was
gently
laid
down
and
the
doctor
hand
passed
lightly
over
the
white
arm
softly
it
touched
the
forehead
and
lay
beneath
the
straying
curl
there
is
no
expression
yet
but
he
takes
the
wrist
again
and
laying
one
hand
beneath
it
he
touches
the
pulse
softly
like
the
first
glance
of
moonlight
on
the
dark
waters
a
smile
is
seen
on
that
kind
face
there
is
something
else
besides
the
smile
large
tears
dropped
from
the
physician
eyes
tears
that
he
did
not
think
to
wipe
away
he
stooped
towards
the
fragile
sufferer
and
gently
as
the
morning
air
breathes
upon
the
drooping
violet
he
kissed
her
brow
alice
sweet
one
he
said
god
has
given
you
to
us
again
where
is
that
mother
has
she
heard
those
cheering
words
she
hears
them
and
is
gone
gone
even
from
the
side
of
her
only
one
the
soul
when
there
is
too
much
joy
longs
for
god
she
must
lay
her
rich
burden
at
the
now
that
mother
kneels
but
utters
no
word
the
incense
of
her
heart
knows
no
language
and
needs
none
for
god
requires
it
not
the
sacrifice
of
praise
from
a
rejoicing
heart
is
a
grateful
offering
that
he
accepts
miss

said
phillis
with
trembling
voice
but
beaming
eye
go
to
bed
now
days
and
nights
you
have
been
up
how
can
you
stand
it
the
doctor
says
she
is
a
great
deal
better
but
she
may
be
ill
for
a
good
while
yet
and
you
will
give
out
i
will
stay
with
her
if
you
will
take
a
sleep

said
weston
no

faithful
phillis
not

too
new
to
me
god
for
ever

for
your
kindness

child

home
and

and
if
she

do
well
i
will
trust

you
and
take
some
rest
myself
weston
awoke
to
hear
glad
tidings
again
and
again
through
the
long
day
he
repeated
to
himself
his
favorite
psalm
praise
the
lord
oh
my
soul
miss
janet
joy
deep
but
silent
was
visible
in
her
happy
countenance
nor
were
these
feelings
confined
to
the
family
every
servant
on
the
estate
made
his
master
joy
his
own
they
sorrowed
with
him
when
he
sorrowed
but
now
that
his
drooping
head
was
lifted
up
many
an
honest
face
regarded
him
with
humble
congratulation
as
kindly
received
as
if
it
had
come
from
the
highest
in
the
land
chapter
xvii
alice
steadily
though
slowly
improved
and
phillis
again
employed
herself
with
her
children
and
her
work
things
had
gone
on
very
well
with
one
of
her
daughter
constant
superintendence
but
bacchus
had
taken
advantage
of
being
less
watched
than
usual
and
had
indulged
a
good
deal
declaring
to
himself
that
without
something
to
keep
up
his
spirits
he
should
die
thinking
about
miss
alice
phillis
as
she
always
was
saw
that
such
had
been
the
case
it
was
about
a
week
after
alice
commenced
to
improve
that
phillis
went
to
her
house
in
the
evening
after
having
taken
charge
of
her
for
several
hours
while
weston
slept
alice
was
very
restless
at
night
and
weston
generally
prepared
herself
for
it
by
taking
some
repose
previously
this
prevented
the
necessity
of
any
one
else
losing
rest
which
now
that
alice
was
entirely
out
of
danger
she
positively
refused
to
permit
as
phillis
went
in
the
door
lydia
was
on
her
knees
just
finishing
the
little
nightly
prayer
that
miss
janet
had
taught
her
she
got
up
and
as
she
was
about
to
go
to
bed
saw
her
mother
and
bade
her
good
night
good
night
and
go
to
bed
like
a
good
child
miss
alice
says
you
may
come
to
see
her
again
phillis
replied
lydia
was
happy
as
a
queen
with
this
promise
aunt
phillis
took
her
pipe
and
her
old
station
outside
the
door
to
smoke
bacchus
had
his
old
crazy
chair
out
there
already
and
he
was
evidently
resolving
something
in
his
mind
of
great
importance
for
he
propped
the
chair
far
back
on
its
one
leg
and
appeared
to
be
taking
the
altitude
of
the
mountains
in
the
moon
an
unfailing
sign
of
a
convulsion
of
some
kind
in
the
inner
man
phillis
said
he
after
a
long
silence
do
you
know
it
is
my
opinion
that
that
old
creature
pointing
with
his
thumb
to
aunt
peggy
house
is
so
long
used
to
grumblin
and
fussin
that
she
ca
to
save
her
life
lie
still
in
her
grave
what
makes
you
think
so
said
phillis
bekase
i
believes
in
my
soul
she
back
thar
this
minute
people
that
drink
bacchus
ca
expect
nothin
else
than
to
be
troubled
with
notions
i
was
in
hopes
aunt
peggy
death
would
have
made
you
afeered
to
go
on
sinning
of
that
when
we
was
all
in
such
grief
and
know
what
was
comin
upon
us
you
must
go
drinking
you
better
a
been
praying
i
tell
you
but
be
sure
your
will
find
you
out
some
day
or
other
the
lord
above
knows
i
pray
for
you
many
a
time
when
i
hard
at
work
my
heart
is
nigh
breaking
when
i
think
where
the
drunkards
will
be
when
the
lord
makes
up
his
jewels
they
ca
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
there
is
no
place
for
them
there
why
ca
you
repent
you
die
in
a
drunken
fit
how
will
i
have
the
heart
to
work
when
i
remember
where
got
to
the
worm
never
dieth
and
the
fire
is
not
quenched
bacchus
was
rather
taken
aback
by
this
sudden
appeal
and
he
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
but
after
a
little
reflection
and
a
good
long
look
at
the
moon
he
recovered
his
confidence
phillis
said
he
do
you
in
sperrits
no
i
do
said
phillis
drily
of
no
kind
bacchus
was
at
a
loss
again
but
he
pretended
not
to
understand
her
and
giving
a
hitch
to
his
uncertain
chair
he
got
up
some
courage
and
said
doggedly
well
i
do
i
do
said
phillis
positively
of
no
kind
bacchus
was
quite
discomposed
again
but
he
said
in
an
appealing
voice
to
his
wife
phillis
i
could
stand
it
when
miss
alice
was
so
low
you
was
busy
and
could
be
a
doin
somethin
for
her
but
what
could
i
do
here
i
sot
all
night
a
cryin
a
thinkin
about
her
and
young
master
i
for
true
she
was
gwine
to
die
and
my
blessed
grief
what
would
have
come
of
us
all
master
arthur
he
a
come
home
but
what
would
be
the
use
and
she
dead
and
gone
every
which
way
i
looked
i
think
i
see
miss
alice
going
up
to
heaven
a
waving
her
hand
to
us
and
we
all
by
ourselves
weepin
and
wailin
phillis
i
could
stand
it
if
i
had
had
a
little
whiskey
i
should
a
been
dead
and
cold
afore
now
you
be
dead
and
cold
afore
long
with
it
said
phillis
i
could
do
nothing
but
cry
phillis
said
bacchus
snuffing
and
blowing
his
nose
and
i
thought
i
might
be
wanted
for
somethin
so
i
jest
took
a
small
drop
to
keep
up
my
strength
phillis
said
nothing
she
was
rather
a
woman
where
whiskey
was
concerned
so
she
gave
bacchus
no
encouragement
to
go
on
excusing
himself
i
tell
you
why
i
believes
in
ghosts
said
bacchus
after
a
pause
see
one
when
said
phillis
i
was
telling
you
that
while
miss
alice
was
so
ill
said
bacchus
i
used
to
set
up
most
of
de
night
i
do
know
how
i
kep
up
for
you
know
niggers
takes
a
sight
of
sleep
when
they
aint
very
young
like
me
well
i
thought
one
time
about
miss
alice
but
more
about
old
aunt
peggy
you
know
she
used
to
set
outside
de
door
thar
very
late
o
nights
it
like
i
was
to
see
her
lean
on
her
stick
and
come
out
every
minute
well
one
night
i
was
sure
i
hear
somethin
thar
i
listened
and
then
somethin
gin
a
kind
o
screech
sounded
like
de
little
niggers
when
aunt
peggy
used
to
gin
a
lick
wid
her
switch
arter
a
while
i
see
de
curtain
lifted
up
i
could
see
what
it
was
but
it
lifted
it
up
i
hearn
some
more
noise
and
i
felt
so
strange
like
that
i
shut
de
door
to
and
went
to
bed
well
i
seed
dat
and
heard
it
for
two
or
three
nights
i
was
gettin
scared
i
tell
you
for
phillis
there
somethin
awful
in
thinkin
of
people
walking
out
of
their
graves
and
ca
get
rest
even
thar
i
could
help
comin
every
night
out
here
twelve
for
that
time
sperrits
i
mean
ghosts
is
so
uneasy
one
night
de
very
night
miss
alice
got
better
i
hearn
de
screech
an
de
fuss
and
i
seed
de
curtain
go
up
and
pretty
soon
what
do
you
think
i
saw
i
tellin
you
no
lie
phillis
i
seed
two
great
red
eyes
a
glarin
out
de
winder
a
glarin
right
at
me
if
you
believe
me
i
fell
down
out
of
dis
very
cheer
and
when
i
got
up
i
gin
one
look
at
de
winder
and
thar
was
de
red
eyes
glarin
agin
so
i
fell
over
de
door
step
tryin
to
get
in
quick
and
then
when
i
did
get
in
i
locked
de
door
my
soul
was
i
skeered
i
never
looked
no
more
i
seen
nuff
dat
time
your
head
was
mighty
foolish
said
phillis
and
you
just
thought
you
saw
it
no
such
thing
i
saw
de
red
eyes
aunt
peggy
red
eyes
high
said
phillis
aunt
peggy
had
red
eyes
not
when
she
was
said
bacchus
but
thar
no
knowin
what
kind
of
eyes
sperrits
gets
when
they
gets
where
it
aint
very
comfortable
well
said
phillis
these
things
are
above
us
we
got
our
work
to
do
and
the
lord
he
does
his
i
do
bother
myself
about
ghosts
i
trying
to
get
to
heaven
and
i
know
i
never
get
there
if
i
do
get
ready
while
i
here
aunt
peggy
aint
got
no
power
to
come
back
unless
god
sends
her
and
if
he
sends
her
its
for
some
good
reason
you
better
come
in
now
and
kneel
down
and
ask
god
to
give
you
strength
to
do
what
is
right
we
got
no
strength
but
what
he
gives
us
i
wish
you
pray
loud
said
bacchus
for
i
aint
felt
easy
of
late
and
somehow
i
ca
pray
well
i
ca
do
much
but
i
can
ask
god
to
give
us
grace
to
repent
of
our
sins
and
to
serve
him
faithfully
said
phillis
and
they
both
kneeled
down
and
prayer
went
forth
from
an
earnest
heart
and
who
shall
say
that
a
more
welcome
offering
ascended
to
his
ear
in
that
time
of
prayer
than
the
humble
but
believing
petition
of
the
slave
phillis
was
of
a
most
disposition
and
possessed
as
an
accompaniment
an
investigating
turn
of
mind
so
before
any
one
was
stirring
in
her
cottage
she
dressed
herself
and
took
from
a
nail
a
key
that
was
over
the
she
hung
it
to
her
little
finger
and
made
straight
for
aunt
peggy
deserted
cabin
she
granted
herself
a
and
determined
to
find
some
clue
to
marvellous
story
her
heart
did
not
fail
her
even
when
she
put
the
key
in
the
lock
for
she
was
resolved
as
a
grenadier
and
she
would
not
have
turned
back
if
the
veritable
red
eyes
themselves
had
raised
the
cotton
curtain
and
looked
defiance
the
lock
was
somewhat
out
of
repair
requiring
a
little
coaxing
before
she
could
get
the
key
in
and
then
it
was
some
time
before
she
succeeded
in
turning
it
at
last
it
yielded
and
with
one
push
the
door
flew
open
now
phillis
anxious
as
she
was
to
have
the
matter
cleared
up
did
not
care
to
have
it
done
so
instantaneously
for
hardly
had
she
taken
one
step
in
the
house
before
she
in
the
most
precipitous
manner
backed
two
or
three
out
of
it
at
first
she
thought
aunt
peggy
herself
had
flown
at
her
and
she
could
hardly
help
calling
for
assistance
but
making
a
great
effort
to
recover
her
composure
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
was
aunt
peggy
enormous
black
cat
who
not
only
resembled
her
in
color
but
disposition
jupiter
for
that
was
the
cat
name
did
not
make
another
grab
but
stood
with
his
back
raised
glaring
at
her
while
phillis
breathing
very
short
sunk
into
aunt
peggy
chair
and
wiped
the
cold
perspiration
from
her
face
with
her
apron
why
jupiter
said
phillis
is
this
you
how
on
earth
did
i
happen
to
forget
you
your
eyes
is
red
to
be
sure
and
no
wonder
you
poor
creature
i
must
a
locked
you
up
here
the
day
after
the
funeral
and
i
never
would
a
forgot
you
if
it
had
been
my
mind
was
so
taken
up
with
miss
alice
why
you
thin
as
a
snake
wait
a
minute
and
i
bring
you
something
to
eat
jupiter
who
had
lived
exclusively
on
mice
for
a
fortnight
was
evidently
subdued
by
the
prospects
of
an
early
breakfast
the
apology
phillis
had
made
him
seemed
not
to
be
without
its
effect
for
when
she
came
back
with
a
small
tin
pan
of
bread
and
milk
and
a
piece
of
bacon
hanging
to
a
fork
his
back
was
not
the
least
elevated
and
he
proceeded
immediately
to
the
hearth
where
the
provender
was
deposited
and
to
use
an
inelegant
westernism
walked
into
it
phillis
meanwhile
going
home
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
result
of
her
exploration
bacchus
toilet
was
completed
he
was
just
raising
up
from
the
exertion
of
putting
on
his
slippers
when
phillis
came
in
laughing
this
was
an
unusual
phenomenon
so
early
in
the
morning
and
bacchus
was
slightly
uneasy
at
its
portent
but
he
ventured
to
ask
her
what
was
the
matter
nothing
said
phillis
only
i
seen
the
ghost
lord
what
the
ghost
said
phillis
and
its
got
red
eyes
too
sure
enough
phillis
said
bacchus
appealingly
you
aint
much
used
to
jokin
and
i
know
you
would
tell
an
ontruth
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
phillis
that
the
very
ghost
you
saw
and
heard
screeching
with
the
red
eyes
glarin
at
you
through
the
window
i
seen
this
morning
phillis
said
bacchus
sinking
back
in
his
chair
possible
what
was
it
a
doin
i
can
tell
you
what
its
doing
now
said
phillis
its
eating
bread
and
milk
and
a
piece
of
bacon
as
hard
as
it
can
its
eyes
is
red
to
be
sure
but
i
reckon
yours
would
be
red
or
shut
one
if
you
a
been
nigh
a
fortnight
locked
up
in
an
empty
house
with
now
and
then
a
mouse
to
eat
why
bacchus
how
come
it
you
forgot
old
jupiter
i
was
too
busy
to
think
about
cats
but
i
wonder
nobody
else
did
think
of
the
poor
animal
sure
enough
said
bacchus
slowly
recovering
from
his
astonishment
its
old
jupiter
why
i
a
sworn
on
the
bible
was
aunt
peggy
sperrit
well
i
do
that
old
cat
lived
all
this
time
well
he
aint
no
cat
any
how
i
always
said
he
was
a
witch
and
now
i
knows
it
that
same
old
jupiter
but
phillis
gal
i
would
say
nothin
at
all
about
it
have
all
dese
low
niggers
laughin
at
us
what
they
going
to
laugh
at
me
about
said
phillis
i
did
see
no
ghost
well
its
all
de
same
said
bacchus
they
laugh
at
me
and
man
and
wife
one
worth
while
to
say
nothin
it
as
i
see
i
sha
say
nothing
about
it
as
long
as
you
keep
sober
but
mind
you
go
pitching
and
tumbling
about
and
i
aint
under
no
kind
of
promise
to
keep
your
secret
and
its
the
blessed
truth
they
laugh
sure
enough
at
you
if
they
did
know
it
and
the
hint
had
such
a
good
effect
that
after
a
while
it
was
reported
all
over
the
plantation
that
bacchus
had
give
up
drinkin
for
good
and
all
chapter
xviii
it
was
in
answer
to
arthur
letter
expressing
great
anxiety
to
hear
from
home
in
consequence
of
so
long
a
time
having
passed
without
his
receiving
his
usual
letters
that
weston
wrote
him
of
alice
illness
she
was
then
convalescing
but
in
so
feeble
and
nervous
a
condition
that
lawton
advised
arthur
remaining
where
he
was
wishing
his
patient
to
be
kept
even
from
the
excitement
of
seeing
so
dear
a
relative
weston
insisted
upon
arthur
being
contented
with
hearing
constantly
of
her
improvement
both
from
himself
and
weston
this
arthur
consented
to
do
but
in
truth
he
was
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
danger
which
had
threatened
alice
life
and
supposed
it
to
have
been
an
ordinary
fever
with
what
pleasure
did
he
look
forward
in
his
leisure
moments
to
the
time
when
it
would
be
his
privilege
always
to
be
near
her
and
to
induce
the
tedious
interval
to
pass
more
rapidly
he
employed
himself
with
his
studies
as
constantly
as
the
season
would
allow
he
had
formed
a
sincere
attachment
to
abel
johnson
whose
fine
talents
and
many
high
qualities
made
him
a
delightful
companion
hubbard
was
a
connection
of
young
johnson
and
felt
privileged
often
to
intrude
himself
upon
them
it
really
was
an
intrusion
for
he
had
at
present
a
severe
attack
of
the
abolition
fever
and
he
could
not
talk
upon
any
other
subject
this
was
often
very
disagreeable
to
arthur
and
his
friend
but
still
it
became
a
frequent
subject
of
their
discussion
when
hubbard
was
present
and
when
they
were
alone
in
the
mean
time
the
warm
season
was
passing
away
and
alice
did
not
recover
her
strength
as
her
friends
wished
no
place
in
the
country
could
have
been
more
delightful
than
exeter
was
at
that
season
but
still
it
seemed
necessary
to
have
a
change
of
scene
september
had
come
and
it
was
too
late
to
make
their
arrangements
to
go
to
the
north
and
alice
added
to
this
a
great
objection
to
so
doing
a
distant
relation
of
weston
a
very
young
girl
named
ellen
graham
had
been
sent
for
in
hopes
that
her
lively
society
would
have
a
good
effect
on
alice
unequal
spirits
and
after
much
deliberation
it
was
determined
that
the
family
with
the
exception
of
miss
janet
should
pass
the
winter
in
washington
miss
janet
could
not
be
induced
to
go
to
that
vanity
fair
as
she
called
it
and
if
proper
arrangements
for
her
comfort
could
not
be
made
the
project
would
have
to
be
given
up
after
many
proposals
each
one
having
an
unanswerable
difficulty
the
old
lady
returned
from
town
one
day
with
a
very
satisfied
countenance
having
persuaded
williams
a
widow
and
her
daughter
to
pass
the
winter
at
exeter
with
her
williams
was
a
much
valued
friend
of
the
weston
family
and
as
no
objection
could
be
found
to
this
arrangement
the
affair
was
settled
alice
although
the
cause
of
the
move
was
the
only
person
who
was
indifferent
on
the
subject
ellen
graham
young
and
gay
as
she
was
would
like
to
have
entered
into
any
excitement
that
would
make
her
forget
the
past
she
fancied
it
would
be
for
her
happiness
could
the
power
of
memory
be
destroyed
she
had
not
sufficient
of
the
experience
of
life
to
appreciate
the
old
man
prayer
lord
keep
my
memory
green
ellen
at
an
early
age
and
an
elder
brother
were
dependent
not
for
charity
but
for
kindness
and
love
on
relatives
who
for
a
long
time
felt
their
guardianship
a
task
they
were
orphans
they
bore
each
other
company
in
the
many
little
cares
of
childhood
and
the
boy
as
is
not
unusual
in
such
a
case
always
looked
to
his
sister
for
counsel
and
protection
not
from
actual
unkindness
but
from
coldness
and
unmerited
reproof
they
never
forgot
their
parting
with
their
mother
the
agony
with
which
she
held
them
to
her
bosom
bitterly
reflecting
they
would
have
no
such
in
the
cold
world
in
which
they
were
to
struggle
yet
they
were
not
unkindly
received
at
their
future
home
their
uncle
and
aunt
standing
on
the
piazza
could
not
without
tears
see
the
delicate
children
in
their
deep
mourning
accompanied
only
by
their
aged
and
respectable
colored
nurse
raise
their
eyes
timidly
appealing
to
them
for
protection
as
hand
in
hand
they
ascended
the
steps
it
was
a
large
and
mansion
and
many
years
had
passed
since
the
pictures
of
the
stiff
looking
cavalier
and
his
smiling
lady
hanging
in
the
hall
had
looked
down
upon
children
at
home
there
the
echoes
of
their
own
voices
almost
alarmed
the
children
when
after
resting
from
their
journey
they
explored
the
scenes
of
their
future
haunts
on
the
glass
of
the
large
window
in
the
hall
were
the
names
of
a
maiden
and
her
lover
descended
from
the
cavaliers
of
virginia
this
writing
was
cut
with
a
diamond
and
the
children
knew
not
that
the
writing
was
their
parents
the
little
ones
walked
carefully
over
the
polished
floors
but
there
seemed
nothing
in
all
they
saw
to
tell
them
they
were
welcome
they
lifted
the
grand
piano
that
maintained
its
station
in
one
of
the
unoccupied
rooms
of
the
house
but
the
keys
were
yellow
with
age
and
many
of
them
soundless
when
at
last
one
of
them
answered
to
the
touch
of
ellen
little
hand
it
sent
forth
such
a
ghostly
cry
that
the
two
children
gazed
at
each
other
not
knowing
whether
to
cry
or
to
laugh
children
are
like
politicians
not
easily
discouraged
and
ellen
come
on
willy
showed
that
she
by
no
means
despaired
of
finding
something
to
amuse
them
they
lingered
up
stairs
in
their
own
apartment
william
pointing
to
the
rock
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
willy
willy
come
here
is
something
and
willy
followed
her
through
a
long
passage
into
a
room
lighted
only
by
the
rays
that
found
entrance
through
a
broken
shutter
only
see
this
she
continued
laying
her
hand
on
a
crib
burdened
with
a
small
mattress
and
pillow
here
too
and
she
pointed
to
a
little
child
hat
that
hung
over
it
from
which
drooped
three
small
plumes
whose
can
they
be
come
out
o
here
children
said
the
nurse
who
had
been
seeking
them
your
aunt
told
me
not
to
let
you
come
into
this
part
of
the
house
this
was
her
nursery
once
and
her
only
child
died
here
the
children
followed
their
nurse
and
ever
afterward
the
thought
of
death
was
connected
with
that
part
of
the
house
often
as
they
looked
in
their
aunt
face
they
remembered
the
empty
crib
and
the
drooping
plumes
time
does
not
always
fly
with
youth
yet
it
passed
along
until
ellen
had
attained
her
sixteenth
year
and
william
his
eighteenth
year
ellen
shared
all
her
brother
studies
and
their
excellent
tutor
stored
their
minds
with
useful
information
their
uncle
superintended
their
education
with
the
determination
that
it
should
be
a
thorough
one
william
did
not
intend
studying
a
profession
his
father
will
allowed
him
to
decide
between
this
or
assuming
at
an
early
age
the
care
of
his
large
estate
with
suitable
advisers
ellen
made
excellent
progress
in
all
her
studies
her
aunt
was
anxious
she
should
learn
music
and
wished
her
to
go
to
richmond
or
to
alexandria
for
that
purpose
but
ellen
begged
off
she
thought
of
the
old
piano
and
its
cracked
keys
and
desired
not
to
be
separated
from
her
brother
professing
her
dislike
to
any
music
but
her
old
nurse
methodist
hymns
william
was
tall
and
athletic
for
his
age
passionate
when
roused
by
harshness
or
injustice
but
otherwise
affectionate
in
his
disposition
idolizing
his
sister
his
uncle
looked
at
him
with
surprise
when
he
saw
him
assume
the
independence
of
manner
which
sat
well
upon
him
and
his
aunt
sometimes
checked
herself
when
about
to
reprove
him
for
the
omission
of
some
unimportant
form
of
politeness
which
in
her
days
of
youth
was
essential
ellen
dwelt
with
delight
upon
the
approaching
time
when
she
would
be
mistress
of
her
brother
establishment
and
as
important
as
she
longed
to
be
on
that
account
though
she
looked
upon
her
uncle
house
as
a
large
cage
in
which
she
had
long
fluttered
a
prisoner
she
could
not
but
feel
an
affection
for
it
her
aunt
and
uncle
often
formal
and
uselessly
particular
were
always
substantially
kind
it
was
a
good
though
not
a
cheerful
home
and
the
young
look
for
joy
and
gaiety
as
do
the
flowers
for
birds
and
sunshine
ellen
was
to
be
a
ward
of
her
uncle
until
she
was
of
age
but
was
to
be
permitted
to
reside
with
her
brother
if
she
wished
from
the
time
he
assumed
the
management
of
his
estate
the
young
people
laid
many
plans
for
housekeeping
william
had
not
any
love
affair
in
progress
and
as
yet
his
sister
image
was
stamped
on
all
his
projects
for
the
future
two
years
before
ellen
came
to
exeter
william
stood
under
his
window
asking
her
what
he
should
bring
her
from
c
the
neighboring
town
do
you
want
some
needles
he
said
or
a
waist
ribbon
or
some
candy
make
haste
ellen
if
i
do
hurry
i
ca
come
home
i
do
want
any
thing
willie
but
will
you
be
sure
to
return
i
never
sleep
well
when
you
are
away
aunt
and
i
are
going
on
tuesday
to
c
wait
and
we
will
stay
all
night
then
oh
no
said
william
i
must
go
but
you
may
depend
upon
my
being
back
i
always
keep
my
promises
so
ellen
leaned
from
the
window
watching
her
handsome
brother
as
he
rode
down
the
avenue
leading
into
the
road
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
bowed
to
her
just
before
he
passed
from
her
sight
oh
mammy
she
said
to
her
attendant
for
she
had
always
thus
affectionately
addressed
her
did
you
ever
see
any
one
as
handsome
as
willie
yes
child
she
replied
his
father
was
before
him
you
both
look
like
your
father
but
master
willie
favors
him
more
than
you
do
shut
down
the
window
miss
ellen
do
you
feel
the
wind
a
strong
march
wind
aint
good
for
nobody
its
bright
enough
overhead
but
the
ground
is
mighty
damp
and
chilly
there
you
sneezin
did
i
tell
you
so
late
in
the
same
day
ellen
was
seated
at
the
window
watching
her
return
gaily
watching
until
the
shadows
of
evening
were
resting
on
his
favorite
rocks
then
she
watched
anxiously
until
the
rocks
could
no
longer
be
seen
but
never
did
he
come
again
though
hope
and
expectation
lingered
about
her
heart
until
despair
rested
there
in
their
place
william
was
starting
on
horseback
after
an
early
dinner
at
the
tavern
in
c
as
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrups
an
old
farmer
who
had
just
driven
his
large
covered
wagon
to
the
door
called
to
him
you
going
home
mr
william
said
he
yes
i
am
but
why
do
you
ask
me
why
how
are
you
going
to
cross
willow
creek
asked
the
old
man
on
the
bridge
said
william
laughing
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
jump
my
horse
across
no
but
you
ca
cross
the
bridge
said
the
farmer
for
the
bridge
is
broken
down
why
i
crossed
it
early
this
morning
said
william
so
did
i
said
the
farmer
and
thank
god
i
and
my
team
did
not
go
down
with
it
but
there
been
a
mighty
freshet
above
and
willow
creek
is
something
like
my
wife
she
an
angel
when
she
aint
disturbed
but
the
devil
himself
when
any
thing
puts
her
out
now
you
take
my
advice
and
stay
here
or
at
any
rate
do
get
yourself
into
danger
i
must
go
home
said
william
i
have
promised
my
sister
to
do
so
i
can
ford
the
creek
and
he
prepared
again
to
start
stop
young
man
said
the
farmer
solemnly
you
mind
the
old
saying
people
think
old
people
fools
but
old
people
know
young
people
are
fools
i
warn
you
not
to
try
and
ford
that
creek
you
might
as
well
put
your
head
in
a
lion
mouth
hav
i
been
crossing
it
these
fifty
years
and
aint
i
up
to
all
its
freaks
and
ways
sometimes
it
is
as
quiet
as
a
wearied
baby
but
now
it
is
foaming
and
lashing
as
a
tiger
after
prey
you
better
disappoint
miss
ellen
for
one
night
than
to
bring
a
whole
lifetime
of
trouble
upon
her
do
be
foolhardy
now
your
horse
ca
carry
you
safely
over
willow
creek
this
night
never
fear
farmer
said
william
i
can
take
care
of
myself
may
the
lord
take
care
of
you
said
the
farmer
as
he
followed
the
youth
dashing
through
the
town
on
his
spirited
horse
if
it
were
not
for
this
and
there
are
so
many
to
be
clothed
and
fed
at
home
i
would
follow
you
but
i
ca
do
it
william
rode
rapidly
homeward
the
noonday
being
long
passed
the
skies
were
clouding
over
and
harsh
spring
winds
were
playing
through
the
woods
william
enjoyed
such
rides
healthy
and
fearing
nothing
he
was
a
stranger
to
a
feeling
of
loneliness
alternately
singing
an
old
air
and
then
whistling
with
notes
as
clear
and
musical
as
a
flute
he
at
last
came
in
sight
of
the
creek
which
had
been
so
tranquil
when
he
crossed
it
in
the
morning
there
was
an
old
house
near
where
lived
the
people
who
received
the
toll
a
man
and
his
wife
with
a
large
family
of
children
poor
people
inheritance
had
long
made
this
place
their
home
and
they
were
acquainted
with
all
the
persons
who
were
in
the
habit
of
traveling
this
way
william
whom
they
saw
almost
daily
was
a
great
favorite
with
the
children
not
only
did
he
pay
his
toll
but
many
a
penny
and
sixpence
to
the
small
folks
besides
and
he
was
accustomed
to
receive
a
welcome
now
the
house
was
shut
up
it
had
rained
frequently
and
heavily
during
the
month
and
the
bright
morning
which
had
tempted
the
children
out
to
play
was
gone
and
they
had
gathered
in
the
old
house
to
amuse
themselves
as
they
could
the
bridge
had
been
partly
carried
away
by
the
freshet
some
of
the
beams
were
still
swinging
and
swaying
themselves
with
restless
motion
the
creek
was
swollen
to
a
torrent
the
waters
dashed
against
its
sides
in
their
haste
to
go
their
way
the
wind
too
howled
mournfully
and
the
old
trees
bent
to
and
fro
nodding
their
stately
heads
and
rustling
their
branches
against
each
other
oh
william
is
it
you
said
the
woman
opening
the
door
get
off
your
horse
and
come
in
and
rest
you
ca
go
home
yes
i
can
though
said
william
i
have
often
forded
the
creek
and
though
i
never
saw
it
as
it
is
now
yet
i
can
get
safely
over
it
i
am
sure
do
talk
of
such
things
for
the
lord
sake
said
jones
why
my
husband
could
not
ford
the
creek
now
and
you
a
mere
boy
no
matter
for
that
said
william
i
promised
my
sister
to
be
at
home
and
i
must
keep
my
word
see
how
narrow
the
creek
is
here
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
it
is
getting
dark
do
try
it
please
do
william
again
said
jones
all
the
children
joined
her
some
entreating
william
others
crying
out
at
the
danger
into
which
their
favorite
was
rushing
why
you
cowards
cried
william
you
make
more
noise
than
the
creek
itself
here
something
for
gingerbread
none
of
the
children
offered
to
pick
up
the
money
which
fell
among
them
but
looked
anxiously
after
william
to
see
what
he
was
going
to
do
william
said
jones
come
back
look
at
the
water
a
roaring
and
tossing
and
your
horse
is
restless
already
with
the
noise
do
throw
your
life
away
think
of
your
sister
i
thinking
of
her
good
jones
never
fear
for
me
said
he
looking
back
at
her
with
a
smile
at
the
same
time
urging
his
horse
toward
the
edge
of
the
creek
where
there
was
a
gradual
descent
from
the
hill
as
jones
had
said
the
horse
had
already
become
restless
he
was
impatiently
moving
his
head
prancing
and
striking
his
hoofs
against
the
hard
ground
william
restrained
him
as
he
too
quickly
descended
the
path
and
it
may
be
the
young
man
then
hesitated
as
he
endeavored
to
check
him
but
it
was
too
late
the
very
check
rendered
him
more
impatient
springing
aside
from
the
path
he
dashed
himself
from
rock
to
rock
william
saw
his
danger
and
with
a
steady
hand
endeavored
to
control
the
frightened
animal
this
unequal
contest
was
soon
decided
the
nearer
the
horse
came
to
the
water
the
more
he
was
alarmed
at
last
he
sprang
from
the
rock
and
he
and
his
rider
disappeared
oh
my
god
said
jones
he
is
gone
the
poor
boy
and
there
is
no
one
to
help
him
she
at
first
hid
her
eyes
from
the
appalling
scene
and
then
approached
the
creek
and
screamed
as
she
saw
the
horse
struggling
and
plunging
while
william
manfully
tried
to
control
him
oh
how
beat
her
heart
as
with
uplifted
hands
and
stayed
breath
she
watched
for
the
issue
it
is
over
now
hush
hush
children
said
their
mother
pale
as
death
whose
triumph
she
had
just
witnessed
oh
if
your
father
had
been
here
to
have
saved
him
but
who
could
have
saved
him
none
but
thou
almighty
god
and
she
kneeled
to
pray
for
she
knew
not
what
too
late
too
late
yet
she
knelt
and
alternately
prayed
and
wept
again
she
gazed
into
the
noisy
waters
but
there
was
nothing
there
and
then
calling
her
frightened
and
weeping
children
into
the
house
she
determined
to
set
forth
alone
for
assistance
for
what
oh
how
long
was
that
night
to
ellen
though
she
believed
her
brother
remained
at
c
she
did
not
sleep
till
late
and
sad
the
awakening
voices
in
anxious
whispers
fell
upon
her
ear
pale
faces
and
weeping
eyes
were
everywhere
around
her
within
confusion
and
useless
effort
without
her
uncle
wept
as
for
an
only
son
her
aunt
then
felt
how
tenderly
she
had
loved
him
who
was
gone
forever
the
farmer
who
had
warned
him
at
the
smote
his
breast
when
he
heard
his
sad
forebodings
were
realized
the
young
and
the
old
the
rich
and
the
poor
assembled
for
days
about
the
banks
of
the
creek
with
the
hopes
of
recovering
the
body
but
the
young
rider
and
his
horse
were
never
seen
again
ah
ellen
was
an
orphan
now
father
mother
and
friend
had
he
been
to
her
the
lost
one
often
did
she
lay
her
head
on
the
kind
breast
of
their
old
nurse
and
pray
for
death
as
far
as
was
in
their
power
her
uncle
and
aunt
soothed
her
in
her
grief
but
the
only
real
comfort
at
such
a
time
is
that
from
heaven
and
ellen
knew
not
that
how
could
she
have
reposed
had
she
felt
the
protection
of
the
everlasting
arms
but
time
though
it
does
not
always
heal
must
assuage
the
intensity
of
grief
the
first
year
passed
after
william
death
and
ellen
felt
a
wish
for
other
scenes
than
those
where
she
had
been
accustomed
to
see
him
she
had
now
little
to
which
she
could
look
forward
her
chief
amusement
was
in
retiring
to
the
library
and
reading
old
romances
with
which
its
upper
shelves
were
filled
this
under
other
circumstances
her
aunt
would
have
forbidden
but
it
was
a
relief
to
see
ellen
interested
in
any
thing
and
she
appeared
not
to
observe
her
thus
employing
herself
so
ellen
gradually
returned
to
the
old
ways
she
studied
a
little
and
assisted
her
industrious
aunt
in
her
numerous
occupations
as
of
old
her
aunt
saw
her
restlessness
of
disposition
and
ellen
felt
rebellious
and
irritable
with
what
an
unexpected
delight
then
did
she
receive
from
her
aunt
hands
the
letters
from
weston
inviting
her
to
come
at
once
to
exeter
and
then
to
accompany
them
to
washington
she
without
any
difficulty
obtained
the
necessary
permission
and
joyfully
wrote
to
weston
how
gladly
she
would
accept
the
kind
invitation
chapter
xix
there
was
an
ancient
enmity
between
jupiter
and
bacchus
while
the
former
was
always
quiet
when
phillis
came
to
see
his
mistress
during
her
life
bacchus
never
went
near
him
without
his
displaying
symptoms
of
the
greatest
irritation
his
back
was
invariably
raised
and
his
claws
spread
out
ready
for
an
attack
on
the
slightest
provocation
phillis
found
it
impossible
to
induce
the
cat
to
remain
away
from
aunt
peggy
house
he
would
stand
on
the
and
make
the
most
appalling
noises
fly
into
the
windows
scratch
against
the
panes
and
if
any
children
approached
him
to
try
and
coax
him
away
he
would
fly
at
them
sending
them
off
in
a
disabled
condition
phillis
was
obliged
to
go
backward
and
forward
putting
him
into
the
house
and
letting
him
out
again
this
was
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
his
savage
mood
continuing
the
servants
were
unwilling
to
pass
him
declaring
he
was
a
good
deal
worse
than
aunt
peggy
had
ever
been
finally
a
superstitious
feeling
got
among
them
that
he
was
connected
in
some
way
with
his
dead
mistress
and
a
thousand
absurd
stories
were
raised
in
consequence
weston
told
bacchus
that
he
was
so
fierce
that
he
might
do
some
real
mischief
so
that
he
had
better
be
caught
and
drowned
the
catching
was
a
matter
of
some
moment
but
phillis
seduced
him
into
a
bag
by
putting
a
piece
of
meat
inside
and
then
dexterously
catching
up
the
bag
and
drawing
the
string
it
was
impossible
to
hold
him
in
so
bacchus
fastened
the
bag
to
the
wheelbarrow
and
after
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
he
got
him
down
to
the
river
under
the
bridge
and
threw
him
in
he
told
phillis
when
he
got
home
that
he
felt
now
for
the
first
time
as
if
aunt
peggy
was
really
dead
and
they
all
might
hope
for
a
little
comfort
hours
after
however
just
as
the
moon
was
rising
bacchus
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
for
jupiter
passed
him
with
his
back
raised
and
proceeded
to
the
door
of
his
old
residence
commencing
immediately
a
most
vociferous
demand
to
be
admitted
bacchus
was
speechless
for
some
moments
but
at
last
made
out
to
call
phillis
who
came
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
the
trouble
look
thar
said
he
you
want
to
make
me
that
aint
ole
aunt
wraith
ground
ca
hold
her
water
ca
hold
him
why
i
drowned
him
deep
how
you
he
got
out
of
that
bag
phillis
could
not
help
laughing
well
i
never
did
see
the
like
the
cat
has
scratched
through
the
bag
and
swam
ashore
i
you
said
bacchus
and
if
you
had
throw
him
into
the
fire
he
would
a
got
burned
but
i
tell
you
no
cat
a
gwine
to
get
the
better
of
me
i
kill
jupiter
yet
phillis
not
wanting
the
people
aroused
got
the
key
and
unlocked
the
door
jupiter
sprang
in
and
took
up
his
old
quarters
on
the
hearth
where
he
was
quiet
for
the
night
in
the
morning
she
carried
some
bread
and
milk
to
him
and
told
bacchus
not
to
say
any
thing
about
his
coming
back
to
any
one
and
that
after
she
came
home
from
town
where
she
was
going
on
business
for
weston
they
would
determine
what
they
would
do
but
bacchus
secretly
resolved
to
have
the
affair
settled
before
phillis
should
return
that
the
whole
glory
of
having
conquered
an
enemy
should
belong
to
him
phillis
was
going
on
a
number
of
errands
to
l
and
she
expected
to
be
detained
all
day
for
she
understood
shopping
to
perfection
and
she
went
charged
with
all
sorts
of
commissions
besides
she
had
to
stop
to
see
one
or
two
sick
old
colored
ladies
of
her
acquaintance
and
she
told
weston
she
might
as
well
make
a
day
of
it
thus
it
was
quite
evening
when
she
got
home
found
every
thing
had
been
well
attended
to
children
in
bed
but
bacchus
among
the
missing
though
he
had
promised
her
he
would
not
leave
the
premises
until
her
return
now
if
there
is
a
severe
trial
on
this
earth
it
is
for
a
wife
of
any
color
who
rarely
leaves
home
to
return
after
a
day
of
business
and
pleasure
having
spent
all
the
money
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
having
dined
with
one
friend
and
taken
a
dish
of
tea
and
gossiped
with
another
to
return
hoping
to
see
every
thing
as
she
expected
and
to
experience
the
bitter
disappointment
of
finding
her
husband
gone
out
in
spite
of
the
most
solemn
asseverations
to
the
contrary
who
could
expect
a
woman
to
preserve
her
composure
under
such
circumstances
poor
phillis
she
was
in
such
spirits
as
she
came
home
how
pretty
the
flowers
look
she
thought
after
all
if
i
am
a
slave
the
lord
is
mighty
good
to
me
i
have
a
comfortable
home
and
a
good
set
of
children
and
my
old
man
has
done
so
much
better
of
late
phillis
felt
really
happy
and
when
she
went
in
and
delivered
all
her
parcels
to
the
ladies
and
was
congratulated
on
her
success
in
getting
precisely
the
desired
articles
her
heart
was
as
light
as
a
feather
she
thought
she
would
go
and
see
how
all
went
on
at
home
and
then
come
back
to
the
kitchen
and
drink
a
cup
of
good
tea
for
the
family
had
just
got
through
with
theirs
what
a
disappointment
then
to
find
any
thing
going
wrong
it
was
not
that
bacchus
society
was
so
entirely
necessary
to
her
but
the
idea
of
his
having
started
on
another
spree
the
fear
of
his
being
brought
home
sometime
to
her
dead
came
over
her
with
unusual
force
and
she
actually
burst
into
tears
she
had
been
so
very
happy
a
few
minutes
before
that
she
could
not
with
her
usual
calmness
make
the
best
of
every
thing
she
forgot
all
about
the
pleasant
day
she
had
passed
lost
her
wish
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
passing
even
her
pipe
by
with
a
full
heart
she
took
her
seat
to
rest
at
the
door
for
some
time
every
thing
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
her
all
at
once
she
found
out
how
tired
she
was
her
limbs
ached
and
her
arm
hurt
her
where
she
had
carried
the
basket
she
had
a
great
many
troubles
she
had
to
work
hard
she
had
more
children
than
anybody
else
to
bother
her
and
when
she
thought
of
bacchus
she
felt
very
angry
he
might
as
well
kill
himself
drinking
at
once
for
he
was
nothing
but
a
care
and
disgrace
to
her
had
always
been
so
and
most
likely
would
be
so
until
they
were
both
under
the
ground
but
this
state
of
mind
could
not
last
long
a
little
quiet
rest
and
thought
had
a
good
effect
she
soon
began
again
to
look
at
the
bright
side
of
things
and
to
be
ashamed
of
her
murmuring
spirit
sure
enough
he
has
kept
very
sober
of
late
and
i
ca
expect
him
to
give
it
up
entirely
all
of
a
sudden
i
must
be
patient
and
go
on
praying
for
him
she
thought
with
great
pity
of
him
and
her
heart
being
thus
subdued
her
mind
gradually
turned
to
other
things
she
looked
at
aunt
peggy
house
and
wondered
if
the
old
woman
was
better
off
in
another
world
than
she
was
in
this
but
she
checked
the
forbidden
speculation
and
next
she
thought
of
jupiter
and
with
this
recollection
came
another
remembrance
of
bacchus
and
his
antipathy
both
to
the
mistress
and
her
cat
all
at
once
she
recalled
bacchus
determination
to
kill
jupiter
and
the
strange
ferocity
the
animal
evinced
whenever
bacchus
went
near
him
and
she
got
up
to
take
the
key
and
survey
the
state
of
things
at
the
deserted
house
there
was
no
key
to
be
found
and
concluding
some
one
had
been
after
jupiter
she
no
longer
delayed
her
intention
of
finding
out
what
had
occurred
in
that
direction
she
found
the
key
in
the
door
but
every
thing
was
silent
with
some
caution
she
opened
it
remembering
jupiter
last
unexpected
onset
when
looking
round
by
the
dim
light
she
perceived
him
seated
opposite
aunt
peggy
big
chest
evidently
watching
it
on
hearing
the
door
open
though
he
got
up
and
raised
his
back
on
the
defensive
phillis
having
an
indefinable
feeling
that
bacchus
was
somehow
or
other
connected
with
the
said
elevation
looked
carefully
round
the
room
but
saw
nothing
gradually
the
chest
lid
opened
a
little
way
and
a
sepulchral
voice
issuing
from
it
uttered
in
a
low
tone
these
words
phillis
gal
is
that
you
the
cat
looked
ready
to
spring
and
the
chest
lid
suddenly
closed
again
but
while
phillis
was
recovering
herself
the
lid
was
cautiously
opened
and
bacchus
eyes
glaring
through
the
aperture
the
words
were
repeated
why
what
on
earth
said
the
astonished
woman
surely
is
that
you
bacchus
it
is
surely
said
bacchus
but
put
that
devil
of
a
tiger
out
of
de
room
if
you
do
want
me
to
die
dis
minute
phillis
presence
always
had
an
imposing
effect
upon
jupiter
and
as
she
opened
the
door
to
the
other
room
and
called
him
in
he
followed
her
without
any
hesitation
she
shut
him
in
and
then
hurried
back
to
lift
up
the
chest
lid
to
release
her
better
half
why
how
said
she
as
bacchus
in
a
most
cramped
condition
endeavored
to
raise
himself
did
the
lid
fall
on
you
no
groaned
bacchus
are
you
sure
de
middle
door
shut
let
me
git
out
o
dis
place
quick
as
possible
for
since
ole
peggy
left
de
ole
boy
hisself
has
taken
up
his
abode
here
as
if
i
never
should
git
straight
agin
why
look
at
your
face
bacchus
said
his
wife
did
jupiter
scratch
you
up
that
way
did
he
though
wait
till
i
gits
out
of
reach
of
his
claws
and
tell
you
about
it
and
they
both
went
out
phillis
locking
the
door
to
keep
jupiter
quiet
that
night
at
least
after
having
washed
the
blood
off
his
face
and
hands
and
surveyed
himself
with
a
dismal
countenance
in
the
bacchus
proceeded
to
give
an
account
of
his
adventure
after
dinner
he
thought
he
would
secure
jupiter
and
have
him
effectually
done
for
before
phillis
came
back
he
mustered
up
all
his
courage
and
unlocking
the
house
determined
to
catch
and
tie
him
then
decide
on
a
mode
of
death
that
would
be
effectual
he
had
heard
some
officer
from
mexico
describe
the
use
of
the
lasso
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
entrap
jupiter
in
this
scientific
manner
but
jupiter
was
an
old
bird
he
was
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
bacchus
lasso
failed
altogether
and
very
soon
the
cat
became
so
enraged
that
bacchus
was
obliged
to
take
a
stool
and
act
on
the
defensive
he
held
the
stool
before
his
face
and
when
jupiter
made
a
spring
at
him
he
dodged
against
him
with
it
two
or
three
blows
excited
jupiter
anger
to
frenzy
and
after
several
efforts
he
succeeded
in
clawing
bacchus
face
in
the
most
dreadful
manner
so
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
could
clear
himself
desperate
with
pain
and
fright
he
looked
for
some
way
of
escape
the
door
was
shut
and
jupiter
who
seemed
to
be
preparing
for
another
attack
was
between
him
and
it
he
had
but
one
resource
and
that
was
to
spring
into
aunt
peggy
great
chest
and
close
the
lid
to
protect
himself
from
another
assault
occasionally
when
nearly
suffocated
he
would
raise
the
lid
to
breathe
but
jupiter
immediately
flew
at
him
in
such
a
furious
manner
that
he
saw
it
would
be
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
attempt
to
escape
and
he
was
obliged
to
bide
his
time
what
his
meditations
were
upon
while
in
the
chest
would
be
hard
to
decide
but
when
once
more
protected
by
the
shadow
of
his
own
roof
he
vowed
jupiter
should
die
and
be
cut
in
pieces
before
he
was
done
with
him
phillis
went
to
miss
janet
and
gave
her
an
account
of
the
whole
affair
with
bacchus
permission
and
the
kind
old
lady
came
to
him
with
some
healing
ointment
of
her
own
manufacture
and
anointed
his
wounds
william
was
sent
for
and
the
result
of
the
discussion
was
that
he
and
his
father
should
early
next
morning
shoot
the
much
dreaded
cat
effectually
this
resolution
was
carried
into
effect
in
the
following
manner
phillis
went
a
little
in
advance
with
a
large
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
and
enticed
jupiter
to
the
hearth
as
he
was
very
hungry
he
did
not
perceive
william
entering
with
a
very
long
gun
in
his
hand
nor
even
bacchus
his
ancient
enemy
with
a
piece
of
down
his
nose
and
across
his
forehead
william
was
quite
a
sportsman
he
went
through
all
the
necessary
formalities
bacchus
gave
the
word
of
command
in
a
low
voice
make
ready
take
aim
fire
bang
and
william
discharged
a
shower
of
shot
into
jupiter
back
and
sides
he
gave
one
spring
and
all
was
over
bacchus
looking
on
with
intense
delight
as
in
the
case
of
aunt
peggy
now
that
his
enemy
was
no
more
bacchus
became
very
magnanimous
he
said
jupiter
had
been
a
faithful
old
animal
though
mighty
queer
sometimes
and
he
believed
the
death
of
aunt
peggy
had
set
him
crazy
therefore
he
forgave
him
for
the
condition
in
which
he
had
put
his
face
and
should
lay
him
by
his
mistress
at
the
lydia
begged
an
old
of
miss
janet
for
a
coffin
and
assisted
her
father
in
the
other
funeral
arrangements
with
a
secret
satisfaction
and
a
solemn
air
bacchus
carried
off
the
box
followed
by
a
number
of
black
children
that
lydia
had
invited
to
the
funeral
they
watched
bacchus
with
great
attention
while
he
completed
his
work
and
the
whole
party
returned
under
the
impression
that
aunt
peggy
and
jupiter
were
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
morning
transactions
chapter
xx
the
time
had
come
to
leave
home
and
the
westons
had
but
one
more
evening
neither
weston
nor
alice
were
well
and
all
hoped
the
change
would
benefit
them
they
were
to
travel
in
their
own
carriage
and
the
preparations
were
completed
the
three
ladies
maids
were
to
go
by
the
stage
miss
janet
had
a
number
of
things
stowed
away
in
the
carriage
which
she
thought
might
be
useful
not
forgetting
materials
for
a
lunch
and
a
little
of
her
own
lavender
in
case
of
a
headache
the
pleasure
of
going
was
very
much
lessened
by
the
necessity
of
leaving
the
dear
old
lady
who
would
not
listen
to
their
entreaties
to
accompany
them
you
with
your
smooth
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
may
well
think
of
passing
a
winter
in
washington
but
what
should
i
do
there
why
the
people
would
say
i
had
lost
my
senses
no
we
three
ladies
will
have
a
nice
quiet
time
at
exeter
and
i
can
go
on
with
my
quilting
and
patchwork
you
see
miss
alice
that
you
come
back
with
red
cheeks
the
birds
and
the
flowers
will
be
glad
to
see
you
again
when
the
spring
comes
ring
the
bell
alice
said
weston
i
must
know
how
little
boy
is
i
sent
mark
shortly
after
dinner
but
here
he
is
well
mark
i
hope
the
little
fellow
is
getting
well
he
is
sir
said
mark
solemnly
he
is
what
said
weston
oh
ah
he
is
dead
i
understand
you
well
i
am
truly
sorry
for
it
when
did
he
die
early
this
morning
sir
said
mark
have
you
any
more
orders
to
give
sir
for
as
i
am
to
be
up
mighty
early
in
the
morning
i
was
thinking
of
going
to
bed
when
you
are
done
with
me
nothing
more
said
weston
and
mark
retired
mark
continued
weston
has
the
greatest
propensity
for
using
hard
words
his
means
deceased
he
was
excessively
angry
with
bacchus
the
other
day
for
interfering
with
him
about
the
horses
said
he
stand
that
old
fellow
airs
he
got
so
full
of
tomposity
that
he
makes
himself
disagreeable
to
everybody
by
i
suppose
you
all
know
he
meant
pomposity
bacchus
is
elated
at
the
idea
of
going
with
us
i
hope
i
shall
not
have
any
trouble
with
him
oh
no
uncle
said
alice
he
is
a
good
old
fellow
and
looks
so
aristocratic
with
his
gray
hair
and
elegant
bows
ellen
and
i
will
have
to
take
him
as
a
beau
when
you
are
out
aunt
phillis
says
that
he
has
promised
her
not
to
drink
a
drop
of
any
thing
but
water
and
she
seems
to
think
that
he
has
been
so
sober
lately
that
he
will
keep
his
word
it
is
very
doubtful
said
weston
but
the
fact
is
he
would
be
troublesome
with
his
airs
and
his
were
i
to
leave
him
so
i
have
no
choice
dear
alice
said
ellen
fixing
her
large
dark
eyes
on
her
how
can
i
ever
be
grateful
enough
to
you
for
what
asked
alice
for
getting
sick
and
requiring
change
of
air
which
is
the
first
cause
of
my
being
here
on
my
way
to
the
great
metropolis
whoever
likes
a
plantation
life
is
welcome
to
it
but
i
am
heartily
sick
of
it
indeed
miss
janet
good
as
you
are
you
could
not
stand
it
at
uncle
ten
miles
from
a
neighbor
just
consider
it
uncle
disapproves
of
campmeetings
and
barbecues
and
aunt
is
sewing
from
morning
till
night
while
i
am
required
to
read
the
spectator
aloud
i
have
a
mortal
grudge
against
addison
but
my
dear
said
miss
janet
you
must
remember
you
are
to
return
to
your
uncle
and
you
must
not
learn
to
love
the
great
world
too
much
perhaps
said
barbour
who
was
much
depressed
at
the
approaching
parting
miss
ellen
may
not
mean
to
return
to
her
uncle
a
young
lady
with
good
looks
and
a
heavy
purse
will
be
found
out
in
washington
she
will
just
suit
a
great
many
there
clerks
with
small
salaries
army
and
navy
men
with
expensive
habits
and
foreign
attachés
who
being
nothing
in
their
own
country
turn
our
young
ladies
heads
when
they
come
here
so
you
think
i
am
destined
for
no
other
fate
than
to
pay
a
debts
thank
you
mr
barbour
the
fact
is
barbour
wants
you
himself
ellen
and
he
is
afraid
somebody
will
carry
you
off
he
will
pay
us
a
visit
this
winter
i
expect
said
weston
well
said
ellen
laughingly
i
rather
take
up
with
him
than
to
go
back
to
my
old
life
now
that
i
see
you
are
all
so
happy
here
but
your
aunt
and
uncle
said
miss
janet
you
must
not
feel
unkindly
toward
them
no
indeed
said
ellen
they
are
both
good
and
kind
in
their
way
but
uncle
is
reserved
and
often
aunt
is
always
talking
of
the
necessity
of
and
the
discipline
of
life
she
is
an
accomplished
teaze
why
do
you
know
continued
ellen
laughingly
as
she
removed
miss
janet
hand
from
her
mouth
the
old
lady
thus
playfully
endeavoring
to
check
her
after
i
had
accepted
weston
kind
invitation
and
mammy
and
i
were
busy
packing
aunt
said
i
must
not
be
too
sanguine
disappointments
were
good
for
young
people
and
that
something
might
occur
which
would
prevent
my
going
i
believe
i
should
have
died
outright
if
it
had
turned
out
so
and
so
said
barbour
to
get
rid
of
a
dull
home
you
are
determined
to
fly
in
the
face
of
fate
and
are
going
to
washington
after
a
husband
ah
miss
ellen
beware
of
these
young
men
that
have
nothing
but
their
whiskers
and
their
epaulettes
let
me
tell
you
of
a
young
friend
of
mine
who
would
marry
the
man
of
her
choice
in
spite
of
the
interference
of
her
friends
and
one
april
morning
in
the
honey
moon
they
were
seen
breakfasting
under
a
persimmon
tree
however
as
you
are
a
young
lady
of
fortune
you
will
always
be
sure
of
coffee
and
hot
rolls
your
good
father
has
made
such
a
sensible
will
that
the
principal
never
can
be
touched
how
many
fine
fortunes
would
have
been
saved
if
southerners
had
taken
such
precautions
long
ago
you
will
have
a
fine
time
young
ladies
you
must
keep
an
account
of
your
conquests
and
tell
me
of
them
when
you
come
back
its
only
ellen
who
is
going
in
search
of
love
adventures
barbour
said
alice
make
yourself
easy
barbour
said
ellen
i
mean
to
have
a
delightful
time
flirting
then
come
back
to
marry
you
and
settle
down
mammy
says
i
ca
help
getting
good
if
i
live
near
miss
janet
well
i
will
wait
for
you
said
barbour
and
now
alice
sing
me
a
sweet
old
scotch
song
sing
within
half
a
mile
of
edinburgh
town
i
ca
come
quite
so
near
it
as
that
said
alice
but
i
will
sing
within
a
mile
she
sang
that
and
then
down
the
burn
davie
then
miss
janet
proposed
lang
syne
in
which
they
all
joined
in
singing
the
chorus
barbour
as
usual
got
very
much
excited
and
alice
a
little
tired
so
that
the
music
ceased
and
alice
took
her
seat
by
her
uncle
on
the
sofa
miss
janet
said
barbour
you
look
better
than
i
have
seen
you
for
a
long
time
thank
you
said
miss
janet
washington
asked
me
the
other
day
if
i
were
ever
going
to
die
i
suppose
like
charles
i
ought
to
apologize
for
being
so
long
in
dying
but
i
am
so
comfortable
and
happy
with
my
friends
that
i
do
not
think
enough
of
the
journey
i
soon
must
take
to
another
world
how
many
comforts
i
have
and
how
many
kind
friends
i
feel
now
that
we
are
about
to
be
separated
that
i
should
thank
you
all
for
your
goodness
to
me
lest
in
the
providence
of
god
we
should
not
meet
again
silver
and
gold
have
i
none
but
such
as
i
have
my
poor
thanks
are
most
gratefully
offered
oh
cousin
janet
said
alice
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
why
will
you
not
go
with
us
your
talking
so
makes
me
dread
to
part
with
you
my
darling
we
must
all
try
to
get
to
heaven
where
there
are
no
partings
i
can
not
be
a
great
while
with
you
remember
i
am
years
old
but
i
will
not
grieve
you
we
will
i
trust
all
meet
here
in
the
spring
god
is
here
and
he
is
in
the
great
city
we
are
all
safe
beneath
his
care
next
summer
he
will
bring
arthur
home
again
partings
should
be
as
short
as
possible
said
barbour
so
i
mean
to
shake
hands
with
everybody
and
be
off
young
ladies
be
generous
do
not
carry
havoc
and
desolation
in
your
train
take
care
of
your
uncle
and
come
back
again
as
soon
as
possible
he
then
took
a
friendly
leave
of
and
weston
and
mounted
his
horse
to
return
home
what
a
nice
old
beau
barbour
would
make
said
ellen
with
his
fine
teeth
and
clear
complexion
i
wonder
he
never
married
upon
my
word
said
miss
janet
you
will
be
wondering
next
why
i
never
married
but
know
miss
ellen
that
barbour
once
had
a
romantic
he
was
to
have
been
married
to
a
lovely
girl
but
death
envied
him
his
bride
and
took
her
off
and
he
has
remained
true
to
her
memory
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
recovered
his
cheerfulness
for
two
years
he
was
the
inmate
of
an
asylum
poor
old
gentleman
said
ellen
i
do
believe
other
people
besides
me
have
trouble
ah
when
you
look
around
you
even
in
the
world
which
you
anticipate
with
so
much
pleasure
you
will
see
many
a
smiling
face
that
tries
to
hide
a
sad
and
aching
heart
a
heart
that
has
ached
more
painfully
than
yours
no
said
ellen
looking
up
from
the
ottoman
at
miss
janet
feet
where
she
was
seated
and
then
bursting
into
tears
oh
thoughtless
and
frivolous
as
i
am
i
shall
never
forget
if
you
knew
how
i
have
wept
and
suffered
you
would
not
wonder
i
longed
for
any
change
that
would
make
me
forget
dear
child
said
miss
janet
laying
her
hand
on
that
young
head
i
did
not
mean
to
reprove
you
when
god
brings
sorrow
on
the
young
they
must
bear
it
with
resignation
to
his
will
he
delights
in
the
happiness
of
his
creatures
and
it
is
not
against
his
will
that
the
young
should
enjoy
the
innocent
pleasures
of
life
then
go
you
and
alice
into
the
world
but
be
not
of
the
world
and
come
back
to
your
homes
strengthened
to
love
them
more
cousin
weston
has
the
bible
opened
waiting
for
us
in
the
mean
time
bacchus
has
received
a
good
deal
of
wholesome
advice
from
phillis
while
she
was
packing
his
trunk
and
in
return
he
has
made
her
many
promises
he
expresses
the
greatest
sorrow
at
leaving
her
declaring
that
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
looking
after
his
master
induces
him
to
do
so
but
he
is
secretly
anticipating
a
successful
and
eventful
campaign
in
washington
all
the
servants
are
distressed
at
the
prospect
of
the
family
being
away
for
so
long
a
time
even
old
wolf
the
has
repeatedly
rubbed
his
cold
nose
against
alice
hand
and
looked
with
the
most
doleful
expression
into
her
beautiful
face
but
dogs
like
their
masters
must
submit
to
what
is
decreed
and
wolf
after
prayers
went
off
peaceably
with
william
to
be
tied
up
lest
he
should
attempt
as
usual
to
follow
the
carriage
in
the
morning
chapter
xxi
you
are
very
much
mistaken
in
your
estimate
of
the
character
of
a
virginian
if
you
suppose
he
allows
himself
or
his
horses
to
be
driven
when
there
is
no
urgent
necessity
for
it
it
is
altogether
different
with
a
yankee
there
is
no
enjoyment
for
him
from
the
time
he
starts
on
a
journey
until
he
reaches
the
end
of
it
he
is
bound
to
be
in
a
hurry
for
how
knows
he
but
there
may
be
a
bargain
depending
and
he
may
reach
his
destination
in
time
to
whittle
successfully
for
it
the
westons
actually
lingered
by
the
way
there
were
last
looks
to
be
taken
of
home
and
its
neighborhood
there
were
partings
to
be
given
to
many
objects
in
nature
dear
from
association
as
ancient
friends
now
the
long
line
of
blue
hills
stands
in
bold
relief
against
the
hazy
sky
now
the
hills
fade
away
and
are
hid
by
thick
masses
of
oak
and
evergreen
here
the
potomac
spreads
her
breast
a
mirror
to
the
heavens
toward
its
low
banks
the
broken
clouds
bending
tranquilly
to
its
surface
there
the
river
turns
and
its
high
and
broken
shores
are
covered
with
rich
and
twining
shrubbery
its
branches
bending
from
the
high
rocks
into
the
water
while
the
misty
hue
of
indian
summer
deepens
every
tint
fair
alice
raises
her
languid
head
already
invigorated
by
the
delightful
air
and
prospect
the
slightest
glow
perceptible
is
making
its
way
to
her
pale
cheek
while
the
gay
and
talkative
ellen
gazes
awhile
at
the
scenery
around
her
then
leans
back
in
the
carriage
closes
her
brilliant
eyes
and
yields
oh
rare
occurrence
to
meditation
two
days
are
passed
in
the
journey
and
our
party
arrived
safely
at
willard
found
their
comfortable
apartments
prepared
for
them
and
their
servants
as
glad
of
their
arrival
as
if
they
had
been
separated
a
year
instead
of
a
day
and
now
dear
reader
i
do
not
intend
discussing
washington
society
it
must
be
a
more
skilful
pen
than
mine
that
can
throw
a
sun
of
light
upon
this
chaos
of
fashionable
life
and
bring
forth
order
and
arrangement
we
are
only
here
for
relaxation
and
change
of
air
and
when
our
invalids
feel
their
good
effects
we
must
return
with
them
to
their
quiet
but
not
unuseful
life
there
were
many
preparations
to
be
made
for
our
young
ladies
proposed
to
enter
into
the
gayeties
of
the
season
ellen
was
to
throw
off
her
mourning
and
her
old
nurse
begged
her
and
alice
to
buy
a
plenty
of
nice
new
clothes
for
they
might
as
well
be
out
of
the
world
as
out
of
the
fashion
they
both
agreed
with
her
for
they
were
determined
to
be
neither
unnoticed
nor
unknown
among
the
fair
ones
of
the
union
who
were
congregated
at
the
capital
do
not
be
astonished
there
is
already
a
tinge
of
red
beneath
the
brown
lashes
on
alice
cheek
and
as
for
her
heart
oh
that
was
a
great
deal
better
too
for
it
has
been
found
by
actual
experiment
that
diseases
of
the
heart
if
treated
with
care
are
not
fatal
any
more
than
any
other
complaints
weston
grew
happier
every
day
and
as
to
alice
uncle
he
hardly
ever
took
his
eyes
off
her
declaring
that
there
must
be
something
marvellously
strengthening
in
the
atmosphere
of
our
much
abused
city
while
alice
hearing
that
walter
lee
was
mixing
in
all
the
gayeties
of
richmond
already
began
to
question
her
attachment
to
him
and
thinking
of
and
devoted
affection
trembled
lest
she
should
have
cast
away
the
love
of
his
generous
heart
weston
often
felt
the
time
hang
heavily
upon
him
though
he
saw
many
valued
friends
he
would
not
have
exchanged
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
for
all
the
honors
that
politics
could
offer
to
her
favorite
votary
and
for
the
ordinary
amusements
which
charmed
alice
and
ellen
even
in
advance
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
say
i
have
no
pleasure
in
them
but
thinking
of
alice
health
only
and
above
all
anxious
that
her
marriage
with
his
son
should
be
consummated
during
his
lifetime
no
sacrifice
appeared
to
him
too
great
to
make
the
weather
was
still
delightful
and
as
the
soirées
assemblies
and
matinées
had
not
yet
commenced
a
party
was
formed
to
go
to
mount
vernon
the
day
fixed
upon
was
a
brilliant
one
in
the
latter
part
of
november
a
number
of
very
agreeable
persons
boarding
in
the
hotel
were
to
accompany
them
bacchus
was
exceedingly
well
pleased
at
the
prospect
miss
alice
he
said
i
is
anxious
to
see
de
old
gentleman
grave
he
was
a
fine
rider
the
only
man
as
ever
i
seed
could
beat
master
in
de
saddle
mark
objected
to
his
carriage
and
horses
being
used
over
such
rough
roads
so
a
large
omnibus
was
engaged
to
carry
the
whole
party
mark
and
bacchus
going
as
outriders
and
a
man
in
a
little
sort
of
a
having
charge
of
all
the
eatables
dishes
plates
which
would
be
required
the
company
were
in
good
spirits
but
they
found
traveling
in
the
state
of
virginia
was
not
moving
over
beds
of
roses
where
are
such
roads
to
be
found
except
in
crossing
a
corduroy
road
in
the
west
where
can
one
hope
to
be
so
thoroughly
shaken
up
i
answer
nowhere
and
have
i
not
a
right
to
insist
for
my
native
state
upon
all
that
truth
will
permit
am
i
not
a
daughter
of
the
old
dominion
a
member
of
one
of
the
did
not
my
grandfather
ride
races
with
general
washington
did
not
my
father
wear
crape
on
his
hat
at
his
funeral
let
that
man
or
woman
inclined
to
deny
me
this
privilege
go
as
i
have
in
a
omnibus
to
mount
vernon
let
him
rock
and
twist
over
gullies
and
let
him
be
tumbled
and
jostled
about
as
i
was
and
i
grant
you
he
will
give
up
the
point
our
party
jogged
along
at
last
the
old
gates
were
in
sight
and
the
ragged
little
negroes
stood
ready
to
open
them
here
we
should
begin
to
be
patriotic
but
do
not
fear
being
troubled
with
a
dissertation
on
this
subject
i
will
not
even
observe
that
by
the
very
gate
that
was
opened
for
the
westons
did
the
father
of
his
country
enter
for
it
would
be
a
reflection
on
the
memory
of
that
great
and
good
man
to
suppose
that
he
would
have
put
his
horse
to
the
useless
trouble
of
jumping
the
fence
when
there
was
such
a
natural
and
easy
way
of
accomplishing
his
entrance
ellen
however
declared
that
she
firmly
believed
those
children
that
opened
the
gates
were
the
same
that
opened
them
for
washington
at
any
rate
their
clothes
were
cut
after
the
same
pattern
if
they
were
not
the
identical
suits
themselves
there
was
a
gentleman
from
the
north
on
the
premises
when
they
arrived
he
joined
the
party
introduced
himself
and
gave
information
that
he
was
taking
in
plaster
the
house
the
tomb
and
other
objects
of
interest
about
the
place
for
the
purpose
of
exhibiting
them
he
made
himself
both
useful
and
agreeable
as
he
knew
it
was
the
best
way
of
getting
along
without
trouble
and
he
was
very
talkative
and
goodnatured
but
some
as
they
approached
the
grave
observed
that
weston
and
one
or
two
others
seemed
to
wish
a
certain
quietness
of
deportment
to
evince
respect
for
the
hallowed
spot
and
the
jest
and
noisy
laugh
were
suddenly
subdued
had
it
been
a
magnificent
building
whose
proportions
they
were
to
admire
and
discuss
had
a
gate
of
fair
marble
stood
open
to
admit
the
visitor
had
even
the
flag
of
his
country
waved
where
he
slept
they
could
not
have
felt
so
solemnized
but
to
stand
before
this
simple
building
that
shelters
his
sarcophagus
from
the
elements
to
lean
upon
unadorned
iron
gates
which
guarded
the
sacred
spot
from
intrusion
to
look
up
and
count
the
little
birds
nests
in
the
plastered
roof
and
the
numberless
hornets
that
have
made
their
homes
there
too
to
pluck
the
tendrils
of
the
wild
grapes
that
cluster
here
this
simple
grandeur
affected
each
one
he
was
again
in
life
before
them
steadily
pursuing
the
great
work
for
which
he
was
sent
and
now
reposing
from
his
labor
and
then
they
passed
on
to
the
old
empty
grave
it
was
decaying
away
yawning
with
its
open
mouth
as
if
asking
for
its
honored
tenement
ellen
gazed
down
and
sprang
in
and
ere
the
others
could
recover
from
their
astonishment
or
come
forward
to
offer
her
assistance
she
looked
up
in
her
beauty
from
the
dark
spot
where
she
was
standing
let
me
get
out
alone
said
she
i
have
such
a
prize
and
she
held
in
her
hand
a
bird
nest
with
its
three
little
white
eggs
deposited
therein
oh
ellen
said
weston
robbing
a
bird
nest
put
it
back
my
dear
no
indeed
weston
do
not
ask
me
think
of
my
finding
it
in
washington
grave
i
mean
to
have
it
put
on
an
alabaster
stand
and
a
glass
case
over
it
and
consider
it
the
most
sacred
gem
i
possess
there
uncle
bacchus
keep
it
for
me
and
do
crush
the
eggs
i
wo
break
miss
ellen
said
bacchus
whose
thoughts
were
apt
to
run
on
sperrits
i
thought
for
certain
you
had
see
de
old
ghost
and
he
had
called
you
down
in
dat
dark
hole
but
thar
aint
no
danger
of
his
comin
back
agin
i
reckon
as
if
it
had
been
long
since
i
followed
him
to
dis
very
grave
what
said
the
northern
gentleman
were
niggers
allowed
to
attend
washington
funeral
colored
people
was
sir
said
bacchus
in
a
dignified
manner
we
aint
much
used
to
being
called
niggers
sir
we
calls
ourselves
so
sometimes
but
gentlemen
and
ladies
sir
mostly
calls
us
colored
people
or
servants
general
washington
hisself
sir
always
treated
his
servants
with
politeness
i
was
very
well
acquainted
with
them
and
know
all
about
the
general
ways
from
them
weston
could
not
but
smile
at
the
reproof
bacchus
had
given
he
turned
and
apologized
to
the
gentleman
for
his
servant
talkativeness
saying
he
was
an
old
and
much
indulged
servant
they
turned
away
from
that
empty
grave
the
young
girls
round
whom
so
many
affections
clustered
the
fond
and
anxious
mother
the
aged
and
affectionate
relative
the
faithful
and
valued
servant
turned
away
from
that
empty
grave
when
will
stay
the
tumultuous
beatings
of
their
hearts
when
will
they
sleep
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
church
each
heart
asked
itself
when
ere
they
left
this
hallowed
spot
weston
addressed
a
gentleman
who
lingered
with
him
this
gentleman
was
an
abolitionist
but
he
acknowledged
to
weston
that
he
had
found
a
different
state
of
things
at
the
south
from
what
he
expected
sir
said
he
to
weston
there
is
a
melancholy
fascination
in
this
hollow
deserted
grave
it
seems
to
be
typical
of
the
condition
in
which
our
country
would
be
should
the
spirit
that
animated
washington
no
longer
be
among
us
weston
smiled
as
he
answered
perhaps
it
is
good
for
you
to
be
here
to
stand
by
the
grave
of
a
slaveholder
and
ask
yourself
i
dare
here
utter
the
calumnies
that
are
constantly
repeated
by
the
fanatics
of
my
party
on
this
spot
sir
the
abolitionist
should
commune
with
his
own
heart
and
be
still
well
was
it
said
by
one
of
your
own
statesmen
doctrines
on
the
slavery
question
are
those
of
my
ancestors
modified
by
themselves
as
they
were
in
an
act
of
confederation
in
this
one
respect
they
left
society
in
the
political
condition
in
which
they
found
it
a
reform
would
have
been
fearful
and
calamitous
a
political
revolution
with
one
class
was
morally
impracticable
consulting
a
wise
humanity
they
submitted
to
a
condition
in
which
providence
had
placed
them
they
settled
the
question
in
the
deep
foundations
of
the
constitution
would
you
then
sir
destroy
the
fabric
by
undermining
the
constitution
alas
this
would
be
the
consequence
were
it
possible
to
carry
out
the
views
of
the
abolition
party
the
beautiful
words
of
harrison
otis
delivered
in
faneuil
hall
boston
would
have
been
appropriate
here
too
speaking
of
the
formation
of
societies
he
said
suppose
an
article
had
been
proposed
to
the
congress
that
framed
the
instrument
of
confederation
proposing
that
the
northern
states
should
be
at
liberty
to
form
associations
and
deluge
the
south
with
homilies
upon
slavery
how
would
it
have
been
received
the
gentleman
before
me
apostrophized
the
image
of
washington
i
will
follow
his
example
and
point
to
the
portrait
of
his
associate
hancock
which
is
pendant
by
its
side
let
us
imagine
an
interview
between
them
in
the
company
of
friends
just
after
one
had
signed
the
commission
for
the
other
and
in
ruminating
on
the
lights
and
shadows
of
futurity
hancock
should
have
said
congratulate
my
country
upon
the
choice
she
has
made
and
i
foresee
that
the
laurels
you
gained
in
the
field
of
braddock
defeat
will
be
twined
with
those
which
shall
be
earned
by
you
in
the
war
of
independence
yet
such
are
the
prejudices
in
my
part
of
the
union
against
slavery
that
although
your
name
and
services
may
screen
you
from
opprobrium
during
your
life
your
countrymen
when
millions
weep
over
your
tomb
will
be
branded
by
mine
as
and
murderers
and
the
stain
of
it
consequently
annexed
to
your
memory
but
alas
the
abolitionist
will
not
reflect
he
lives
in
a
whirlpool
whither
he
has
been
drawn
by
his
own
rashness
what
to
him
is
the
love
of
country
or
the
memory
of
washington
john
randolph
said
i
should
have
been
a
french
atheist
had
not
my
mother
made
me
kneel
beside
her
as
she
folded
my
little
hands
and
taught
me
to
say
father
remember
this
mothers
in
america
and
imprint
upon
the
fair
tablet
of
your
young
child
heart
a
reverence
for
the
early
institutions
of
their
country
and
for
the
patriots
who
moulded
them
that
god
and
my
country
may
be
the
motto
of
their
lives
chapter
xxii
alice
said
weston
as
they
sat
together
one
morning
before
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
if
you
choose
i
will
read
to
you
the
last
part
of
cousin
janet
letter
you
know
my
daughter
of
walter
gay
course
in
richmond
and
it
is
as
i
always
feared
there
is
a
tendency
to
recklessness
and
dissipation
in
walter
disposition
with
what
a
spirit
of
deep
thankfulness
you
should
review
the
last
few
months
of
your
life
i
have
sometimes
feared
i
was
unjust
to
walter
my
regret
at
the
attachment
for
him
which
you
felt
at
one
time
became
a
personal
dislike
which
i
acknowledge
i
was
wrong
to
yield
to
but
i
think
we
both
acted
naturally
circumstanced
as
we
were
dear
as
you
are
to
me
i
would
rather
see
you
dead
than
the
victim
of
an
unhappy
marriage
love
is
not
blind
as
many
say
i
believe
the
stronger
one
love
is
the
more
palpable
the
errors
of
its
object
it
was
so
with
me
and
it
would
be
so
with
you
that
you
have
conquered
this
attachment
is
the
crowning
blessing
of
my
life
even
should
you
choose
never
to
consummate
your
engagement
with
arthur
i
will
at
least
thank
god
that
you
are
not
the
wife
of
a
man
whose
violent
passions
even
as
a
child
could
not
be
controlled
and
who
is
destitute
of
a
spark
of
religious
principle
i
will
now
read
you
what
cousin
janet
says
have
received
a
long
letter
from
the
episcopal
clergyman
in
richmond
in
answer
to
mine
inquiring
of
walter
all
that
i
feared
is
true
walter
is
not
only
gay
but
dissipated
says
he
has
called
to
see
him
repeatedly
and
invited
him
to
his
house
and
has
done
all
that
he
could
to
interest
him
in
those
pleasures
that
are
innocent
and
ennobling
but
alas
it
is
difficult
to
lay
aside
the
wine
cup
when
its
intoxicating
touch
is
familiar
to
the
lips
and
so
of
the
other
forbidden
pleasures
of
life
to
one
of
walter
temperament
there
is
danger
walter
is
gambling
too
and
bets
high
he
will
of
course
be
a
prey
to
the
more
experienced
ones
who
will
take
advantage
of
his
youth
and
generosity
to
rob
him
for
is
a
professed
gambler
better
than
a
common
thief
is
needless
for
me
to
say
i
have
shed
many
tears
over
this
letter
tears
are
for
the
living
and
i
expect
to
shed
them
while
i
wear
this
garment
of
mortality
can
it
be
that
in
this
case
the
wise
creator
will
visit
the
sins
of
the
father
upon
the
child
are
are
all
my
tears
and
prayers
to
fail
i
can
not
think
so
while
he
reigns
in
heaven
in
the
same
body
with
which
he
suffered
on
earth
in
the
very
hand
that
holds
the
sceptre
is
the
print
of
the
nails
under
the
royal
crown
that
encircles
his
brow
can
still
be
traced
the
marks
of
the
thorns
he
is
surely
then
touched
with
a
feeling
of
our
infirmities
and
he
will
in
the
end
bring
home
this
child
of
my
love
and
my
adoption
i
often
say
to
myself
could
i
see
alice
and
arthur
and
walter
happy
how
happy
should
i
be
i
would
be
more
than
willing
to
depart
but
there
would
be
still
a
care
for
something
in
this
and
withered
frame
it
will
be
far
better
to
be
with
jesus
but
he
will
keep
me
here
as
long
as
he
has
any
thing
for
me
to
do
the
dear
girls
i
am
glad
they
are
enjoying
themselves
but
i
long
to
see
them
again
i
hope
they
will
not
be
carried
away
by
the
gay
life
they
are
leading
i
shall
be
glad
when
they
are
at
their
home
duties
again
will
be
well
with
arthur
and
alice
you
know
old
maids
are
always
the
best
informed
on
other
people
love
affairs
when
arthur
left
home
alice
felt
only
a
sisterly
affection
for
him
when
walter
went
away
it
was
really
no
more
for
him
either
but
her
kind
heart
grieved
when
she
saw
him
so
situated
and
sympathy
you
know
is
akin
to
love
she
must
remember
now
the
importance
that
attaches
itself
to
an
engagement
of
marriage
and
not
give
arthur
any
more
rivals
she
was
off
her
guard
before
as
her
feeling
an
affection
for
arthur
was
considered
rather
too
much
a
matter
of
course
but
she
can
not
fail
at
some
future
day
to
return
his
devoted
affection
in
the
mean
time
the
young
people
are
both
i
trust
doing
well
arthur
so
long
in
another
section
of
his
own
dear
country
will
be
less
apt
to
be
unduly
prejudiced
in
favor
of
his
own
and
alice
will
only
mingle
in
the
gay
world
enough
to
see
the
vanity
of
its
enjoyments
she
will
thus
be
prepared
to
perform
with
fidelity
the
duties
that
belong
to
her
position
as
the
wife
of
a
country
gentleman
no
wonder
that
my
spectacles
are
dim
and
my
old
eyes
aching
after
this
long
letter
love
to
dear
cousin
weston
to
the
girls
to
yourself
and
all
the
servants
cousin
janet
says
she
has
not
enough
to
do
to
keep
her
employed
she
has
not
been
well
this
winter
her
old
cough
has
returned
and
she
is
thinner
than
i
ever
saw
her
has
been
to
see
her
several
times
and
he
is
anxious
for
her
to
take
care
of
herself
she
bids
me
say
to
bacchus
that
if
he
have
broken
his
promise
she
hopes
he
will
be
endowed
with
strength
from
above
to
keep
it
better
in
future
how
much
can
we
all
learn
from
good
phillis
alice
made
no
observation
as
her
mother
folded
the
letter
and
laid
it
on
her
dressing
table
but
there
lay
not
now
on
the
altar
of
her
heart
a
spark
of
affection
for
one
who
for
a
time
she
believed
to
be
so
passionately
beloved
the
fire
of
that
love
had
indeed
gone
out
but
there
had
lingered
among
its
embers
the
form
and
color
of
its
coals
these
might
have
been
rekindled
but
that
was
past
forever
the
rude
but
kind
candor
that
conveyed
to
her
the
knowledge
of
walter
unworthiness
had
dissolved
its
very
shape
the
image
was
displaced
from
its
shrine
walter
was
indeed
still
beloved
but
it
was
the
affection
of
a
pure
sister
for
an
erring
brother
it
was
only
to
one
to
whom
her
soul
in
its
confiding
trust
and
virtue
could
look
up
that
she
might
accord
that
trusting
devotion
and
reverence
a
woman
feels
for
the
chosen
companion
of
her
life
and
this
i
hear
you
say
my
reader
is
the
awakening
of
a
love
dream
so
powerful
as
to
undermine
the
health
of
the
sleeper
so
dark
as
to
cast
a
terror
and
a
gloom
upon
many
who
loved
her
it
is
even
so
in
life
and
would
you
have
it
otherwise
do
you
commend
that
morbid
affection
which
clings
to
its
object
not
only
through
sorrow
but
sin
through
sorrow
but
not
in
sin
nor
is
it
possible
for
a
woman
to
love
unworthily
and
continue
pure
this
alice
felt
and
she
came
forth
from
her
struggle
stronger
and
more
holy
prizing
above
all
earthly
things
the
friends
who
had
thus
cleared
for
her
her
pathway
and
turning
with
a
sister
love
which
was
all
indeed
she
had
ever
known
to
that
one
who
far
away
would
yet
win
with
his
unchanging
affection
her
heart
to
his
own
walter
lee
case
was
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
many
young
men
are
led
into
dissipation
simply
from
the
want
of
proper
occupation
there
was
in
him
no
love
of
vice
for
itself
but
disappointed
in
securing
consent
to
his
addresses
and
feeling
in
the
effort
to
win
her
affections
from
arthur
he
sought
forgetfulness
in
dissipation
and
excitement
he
fancied
he
would
find
happiness
in
the
the
theatre
the
midnight
revel
and
at
the
gambling
table
have
you
not
met
in
the
changing
society
of
a
large
city
one
whose
refined
and
gentle
manners
told
of
the
society
of
a
mother
a
sister
or
of
some
female
friend
whose
memory
like
an
angel
wing
was
still
hovering
around
him
have
you
not
pitied
him
when
you
reflected
that
he
was
alone
far
away
from
such
good
influences
have
you
not
longed
to
say
to
him
i
wish
i
could
be
to
you
what
has
been
and
warn
you
of
the
rocks
and
quicksands
against
which
you
may
be
shipwrecked
there
were
many
who
felt
thus
towards
walter
his
strikingly
handsome
face
and
figure
his
grace
and
intelligence
with
a
slight
reserve
that
gave
a
charm
to
his
manner
to
few
was
his
history
familiar
the
world
knew
of
his
name
and
to
the
world
he
was
an
object
of
importance
for
gold
stamps
its
owner
with
a
letter
of
credit
through
life
walter
launched
into
every
extravagance
that
presented
itself
he
was
flattered
and
invited
to
balls
and
parties
smiles
met
him
at
every
step
and
the
allurements
of
the
world
dazzled
him
as
they
had
many
a
previous
victim
sometimes
the
thought
of
alice
in
her
purity
and
truth
passed
like
a
sunbeam
over
his
heart
but
its
light
was
soon
gone
she
was
not
for
him
and
why
should
he
not
seek
as
others
had
done
to
drown
all
care
then
the
thought
of
cousin
janet
good
and
holy
cousin
janet
with
her
bible
in
her
hand
and
its
sacred
precepts
on
her
lips
would
weigh
like
a
mountain
on
his
soul
but
he
had
staked
all
for
pleasure
and
he
could
not
lose
the
race
it
is
not
pleasant
to
go
down
step
after
step
to
the
dark
dungeon
of
vice
we
will
not
follow
walter
to
the
revel
nor
the
we
will
close
our
ears
to
the
blasphemous
oaths
of
his
companions
to
the
imprecations
on
his
own
lips
the
career
of
folly
and
of
sin
was
destined
to
be
closed
and
rather
would
we
draw
a
veil
over
its
every
scene
step
by
step
he
trod
the
path
of
sin
until
at
last
urged
by
worldly
and
false
friends
to
a
quarrel
commenced
on
the
slightest
grounds
he
challenged
one
who
had
really
never
offended
him
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
then
walter
lee
was
a
murderer
he
gazed
upon
the
youthful
noble
countenance
he
felt
again
and
again
the
quiet
pulse
weeping
when
he
saw
the
useless
efforts
to
bring
back
life
he
was
a
murderer
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
for
he
had
been
taught
that
he
who
gave
life
alone
had
the
power
to
take
it
away
he
knew
that
god
would
require
of
him
his
brother
blood
he
knew
too
that
though
the
false
code
of
honor
in
society
would
acquit
him
yet
he
would
be
branded
even
as
cain
he
could
see
the
finger
of
scorn
pointed
towards
him
he
could
hear
men
good
men
say
there
is
walter
lee
who
killed
a
man
in
a
duel
ah
cousin
janet
not
in
vain
were
your
earnest
teachings
not
in
vain
had
you
sung
by
his
pillow
in
boyhood
of
jesus
who
loved
all
even
his
enemies
not
in
vain
had
you
planted
the
good
seed
in
the
ground
and
watered
it
not
in
vain
are
you
now
kneeling
by
your
bedside
imploring
god
not
to
forsake
forever
the
child
of
your
prayers
go
to
your
rest
in
peace
for
god
will
yet
bring
him
home
after
all
his
wanderings
for
walter
lee
far
away
is
waking
and
restless
oppressed
with
horror
at
his
crime
flying
from
law
and
justice
flying
from
the
terrors
of
a
burdened
conscience
he
is
a
murderer
like
cain
he
is
a
wanderer
he
gazes
into
the
depths
of
the
dark
sea
he
is
crossing
but
there
is
no
answering
abyss
in
his
heart
where
he
can
lose
the
memory
of
his
deed
he
can
not
count
the
wretched
nights
of
watching
and
of
thought
time
brings
no
relief
change
no
solace
when
the
soul
in
its
flight
to
eternity
turns
away
from
god
how
droop
her
wings
she
has
no
star
to
guide
her
upward
course
but
she
wanders
through
a
strange
land
where
all
is
darkness
and
grief
he
traversed
many
a
beautiful
country
he
witnessed
scenes
of
grandeur
he
stood
before
the
works
of
genius
and
of
art
he
listened
to
music
sweet
like
angels
songs
but
has
he
peace
young
reader
there
is
no
peace
without
god
now
in
this
world
there
is
many
a
brow
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
its
flowers
could
we
trace
the
stories
written
on
many
hearts
how
would
they
tell
of
sorrow
how
many
would
say
in
the
crowded
and
noisy
revel
i
have
come
here
to
forget
but
memory
will
never
die
chapter
xxiii
alice
and
ellen
accompanied
by
weston
and
some
gentlemen
from
their
section
of
the
country
were
to
attend
a
private
ball
expected
to
be
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
the
season
weston
not
feeling
well
retired
early
preferring
to
listen
to
the
young
ladies
account
of
the
evening
after
his
breakfast
and
newspaper
the
next
morning
when
they
were
ready
to
go
they
came
into
weston
parlor
to
obtain
his
commendation
on
their
taste
weston
was
there
awaiting
them
and
her
own
appearance
was
too
striking
to
be
passed
over
without
notice
she
was
still
really
a
handsome
woman
and
her
beauty
was
greatly
enhanced
by
her
excellent
taste
in
dress
her
arms
still
round
and
white
were
not
uncovered
the
rich
lace
sleeves
and
the
scarf
of
the
same
material
that
was
thrown
over
her
handsome
neck
and
shoulders
was
far
more
becoming
than
if
she
had
assumed
the
bare
arms
and
neck
which
was
appropriate
to
her
daughter
her
thick
dark
hair
was
simply
put
back
from
her
temples
as
she
always
wore
it
contrasting
beautifully
with
the
delicate
white
flowers
there
her
brocade
silk
fitting
closely
to
her
still
graceful
figure
and
the
magnificent
diamond
pin
that
she
wore
in
her
bosom
the
perfect
fitness
of
every
part
of
her
apparel
gave
a
dignity
and
beauty
to
her
appearance
that
might
have
induced
many
a
gay
lady
who
mixes
winter
after
winter
in
the
amusements
of
our
city
to
go
and
do
likewise
when
youth
is
gone
forever
it
is
better
to
glide
gracefully
into
middle
age
and
if
half
the
time
and
thought
that
is
expended
on
the
choice
of
gay
colors
and
costly
material
were
passed
in
properly
arranging
what
is
suitable
to
age
and
appearance
the
fashionable
assemblies
of
the
present
day
would
not
afford
such
spectacles
as
can
not
fail
both
to
pain
and
amuse
weston
turned
to
the
door
as
it
opened
expecting
the
girls
to
enter
and
a
little
impatient
too
as
it
was
already
ten
the
gentlemen
had
been
punctual
to
their
appointed
hour
of
ten
but
declared
that
three
quarters
of
an
hour
was
an
unusually
short
time
to
be
kept
waiting
by
ladies
ellen
came
first
her
tall
but
figure
arrayed
in
a
silk
of
the
most
costly
material
she
wore
a
necklace
and
bracelet
of
pearl
and
a
string
of
the
same
encircled
her
hair
the
rich
color
that
mantled
in
her
cheeks
deepened
still
more
as
she
acknowledged
the
salutation
of
the
gentlemen
but
alice
who
entered
immediately
after
her
went
at
once
to
her
uncle
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
looked
the
inquiry
are
you
pleased
with
me
no
wonder
the
old
man
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
deprived
of
the
power
of
answering
her
she
stood
before
him
glowing
with
health
again
the
coral
lips
parted
with
a
smile
awaiting
some
word
of
approval
the
eyes
the
ivory
skin
the
cheeks
the
oval
face
the
auburn
curls
that
fell
over
brow
and
temple
and
hung
over
the
rounded
and
beautiful
shoulders
the
perfect
arm
displayed
in
its
full
beauty
by
the
short
plain
sleeve
the
simple
dress
of
white
the
whole
figure
so
fair
and
interesting
with
no
ornaments
to
dim
its
youthful
charms
but
one
flower
a
lily
drooping
over
her
bosom
the
tears
gathered
in
his
large
eyes
and
drawing
her
gently
towards
him
he
kissed
her
lips
alice
my
beloved
he
said
sweetest
of
god
earthly
gifts
you
can
not
be
always
as
fair
and
young
as
you
are
now
but
may
god
keep
your
heart
as
pure
and
childlike
until
he
take
you
to
the
heaven
which
is
your
destiny
before
any
one
could
reply
he
had
bowed
to
the
rest
of
the
company
and
left
the
room
and
even
alice
accustomed
as
she
was
to
his
partial
affection
felt
solemnized
at
the
unusual
earnestness
with
which
he
had
addressed
her
but
weston
hurried
them
off
to
the
scene
of
fashion
and
splendor
which
they
had
been
anticipating
weston
was
about
to
retire
when
bacchus
suddenly
entered
the
room
preceded
by
a
slight
knock
he
was
very
much
excited
and
evidently
had
information
of
great
importance
to
communicate
master
said
he
without
waiting
to
get
breath
they
all
got
took
what
is

says
he
wish
you
joy
of
them
they
brought
you
to
a
pretty
pass
and
lost
you
as
good
a
home
as
ever
a
servant
had
master
said
simon
you

me
back
indeed
i
will
be
faithful
trust
you
simon
said
seymour
none
of
your
want
you
back
you
have
no
relations
my
mother
bought
you
when
you
was
a
little
boy
because
she
knew
your
mother
and
after
she
died
you
were
knocked
about
by
the
other
servants
my
sister
taught
you
how
to
read
the
bible
and
you
have
been
a
member
of
the
methodist
church
if
you
was
a
poor
ignorant
fellow
that
did
know
what
was
right
i
would
take
you
back
but
you
done
this
wid
your
eyes
open
our
servants
say
they
wants
no
runaways
to
live
o
them
now
if
you
can
get
any
of
your
abolition
friends
to
buy
you
and
take
you
north
and
make
a
gentleman
of
you
i
sell
you
to
them
but
they
would
give
a
fip
to
keep
you
from
starving
i
am
sorry
its
so
but
i
ca
take
you
back
he
said
these
very
words
sir
he
felt
mighty
bad
sir
he
talked
husky
but
he
went
out
simon
called
after
him
but
he
did
even
look
back
so
i
know
goin
for
true
i
am
really
sorry
for
the
servants
bacchus
said
weston
but
they
wo
take
warning
i
told
that
since
abolitionists
have
come
to
live
in
washington
and
have
been
going
among
the
colored
people
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
employ
an
honest
servant
it
is
on
this
account
that
the
irish
are
so
much
employed
some
years
ago
the
families
had
no
trouble
with
their
domestics
but
abolition
has
ruined
them
what
a
wretched
looking
class
they
are
too
lazy
and
dirty
these
are
the
consequences
of
taking
bad
advice
well
master
said
bacchus
i
wish
to
de
lord
we
could
take
all
to
virginny
and
give
a
good
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
thar
all
them
feathers
poor
aunt
peggy
had
in
them
barrels
we
aint
got
no
call
for
at
home
i
wish
we
could
put
to
some
use
i
would
like
no
better
fun
than
to
spread
de
tar
on
neat
and
den
stick
de
feathers
on
close
and
thick
well
bacchus
said
weston
its
near
bedtime
and
i
am
not
well
so
i
will
retire
certainly
master
you
must
me
i
afeard
i
kep
you
up
i
felt
mightily
for
them
poor
creaturs
thar
lor
master
i
aint
nigh
so
weakly
as
you
and
think
i
nussed
you
and
used
to
toat
you
on
my
back
when
you
was
a
little
boy
you
was
mighty
fat
i
tell
you
i
used
to
think
my
back
would
bust
sometimes
but
i
pretty
strong
yet
like
i
could
toat
you
now
if
i
was
to
try
not
thank
you
bacchus
though
if
any
thing
should
occur
to
make
it
necessary
i
will
call
you
said
weston
bacchus
slept
in
a
kind
of
closet
bedroom
off
his
master
and
he
went
in
accordingly
but
after
a
few
moments
returned
finding
weston
in
bed
will
you
have
any
thing
sir
nothing
well
master
i
was
thinkin
to
say
one
thing
more
and
is
if
dese
abolitioners
dat
has
so
much
larnin
if
they
only
had
some
of
the
bible
larnin
my
wife
has
how
much
good
do
my
wife
says
put
her
here
a
slave
and
she
a
gwine
to
wait
for
him
to
set
her
free
if
he
aint
ready
to
do
so
till
he
calls
her
to
heaven
she
willin
to
wait
lord
sir
my
wife
she
sets
at
de
feet
of
jesus
and
larns
her
bible
i
reckon
de
abolitioners
aint
willin
to
do
that
they
do
want
to
get
so
low
down
as
if
they
aint
willin
to
go
about
doin
good
like
jesus
did
but
they
must
be
puttin
up
poor
slaves
to
sin
and
sorrow
well
they
got
to
go
to
their
account
any
how
bacchus
finally
retired
but
it
was
with
difficulty
he
composed
himself
to
sleep
he
was
still
mentally
discussing
that
great
subject
abolition
which
like
a
mighty
tempest
was
shaking
the
whole
country
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
do
no
good
to
worry
about
it
so
he
settled
himself
to
sleep
a
bright
idea
crossed
his
mind
as
he
closed
his
eyes
upon
the
embers
that
were
fading
on
the
hearth
in
his
master
room
in
another
moment
he
was
reposing
in
utter
oblivion
of
all
things
whether
concerning
his
own
affairs
or
those
of
the
world
in
general
the
next
morning
just
as
weston
had
finished
his
paper
bacchus
came
in
with
a
pair
of
boots
shining
astonishingly
i
believe
said
weston
i
wo
put
them
on
yet
our
ladies
have
not
come
down
to
breakfast
and
its
hardly
time
for
it
is
but
nine
i
think
it
must
have
been
morning
when
they
came
home
yes
sir
said
bacchus
they
aint
awake
yet
aunt
marthy
tells
me
well
let
them
sleep
i
have
breakfasted
and
i
will
sit
here
and
enjoy
this
good
fire
until
they
come
bacchus
lingered
and
looked
as
if
he
could
not
enjoy
any
thing
that
morning
any
thing
the
matter
bacchus
said
weston
well
said
bacchus
nothin
more
i
than
what
i
had
a
right
to
expect
of
simon
got
to
go
i
done
all
i
could
for
him
but
it
aint
nothin
after
all
what
could
you
do
said
weston
well
master
i
was
nigh
asleep
last
night
when
all
at
once
i
thought
dis
here
abolition
gentleman
baker
that
boards
long
wid
us
now
thinks
i
he
is
a
mighty
nice
kind
of
man
talks
a
heap
god
and
the
gospel
and
our
duty
to
our
i
know
he
had
a
sight
of
money
for
his
white
servant
told
me
he
was
a
great
man
in
boston
had
a
grand
house
thar
his
wife
rode
in
elegant
carriages
and
his
children
has
the
best
of
every
thing
so
i
says
to
myself
he
aint
like
the
rest
of
he
do
approve
of
stealing
and
lying
and
the
like
that
if
he
thinks
the
southern
gentlemen
oughter
set
all
their
niggers
free
why
he
oughter
be
willin
to
lose
just
a
little
for
one
man
so
i
went
straight
to
his
room
to
ask
him
to
buy
simon
that
was
very
wrong
bacchus
said
weston
sternly
do
you
know
your
duty
better
than
to
be
interfering
in
the
concerns
of
these
people
i
am
excessively
mortified
what
will
this
gentleman
think
of
me
nothin
master
said
bacchus
do
be
oneasy
i
told
him

friends

slaves
than

like
of
you
well
bacchus
said
weston
you
did
very
wrong
and
i
hope
you
will
not
again
take
such
a
liberty
with
any
person
you
see
for
yourself
what
an
abolitionist
is
i
wish
those
poor
runaways
had
had
some
such
experience
it
would
have
saved
them
from
the
trouble
they
are
now
in
yes
indeed
master
i
been
down
thar
agin
i
went
right
early
thar
an
ole
woman
thar
that
tried
to
run
away
she
gwine
too
and
she
leaves
her
husband
here
she
aint
a
cryin
though
her
heart
too
full
for
tears
oh
master
said
bacchus
sighing
deeply
i
think
if
you
seed
her
you
do
more
than
the
abolitioners
in
the
afternoon
weston
usually
walked
out
he
did
not
dine
with
the
ladies
at
their
late
hour
as
his
complaint
dyspepsia
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
live
lightly
and
regularly
bacchus
attended
him
in
his
walks
and
many
a
person
turned
back
to
look
upon
the
old
gentleman
with
his
cane
and
his
servant
whose
appearance
was
as
agreeable
as
his
own
bacchus
was
constantly
on
the
lookout
for
his
master
but
he
managed
to
see
all
that
was
going
on
too
and
to
make
many
criticisms
on
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
those
he
met
in
his
rambles
bacchus
followed
his
master
and
found
that
he
was
wending
his
steps
to
the
place
where
the
arrested
runaways
were
confined
this
was
very
agreeable
to
him
for
his
heart
was
quite
softened
towards
the
poor
prisoners
and
he
had
an
idea
that
his
master
very
presence
might
carry
a
blessing
with
it
bacchus
said
weston
as
they
were
going
in
you
need
not
point
out
the
servants
to
me
i
will
observe
for
myself
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
conspicuous
there
were
a
great
many
lounging
about
and
looking
round
there
some
were
considering
the
scene
as
merely
curious
some
were
blaming
the
slaves
some
their
masters
some
the
abolitionists
there
was
confusion
and
constant
going
in
and
out
but
though
the
countenances
of
the
runaways
expressed
different
emotions
it
was
evident
that
one
feeling
had
settled
in
each
breast
and
that
was
there
was
no
hope
that
any
thing
would
occur
to
relieve
them
from
their
undesirable
position
weston
easily
recognized
simon
from
bacchus
description
he
had
a
boyish
expression
of
disappointment
and
irritation
on
his
countenance
and
had
evidently
been
recently
weeping
there
were
several
men
one
or
two
of
them
with
bad
faces
and
one
a
light
mulatto
had
a
fine
open
countenance
and
appeared
to
be
making
an
effort
not
to
show
his
excessive
disappointment
in
the
corner
sat
the
woman
on
a
low
bench
her
head
was
bent
forward
on
her
lap
and
she
was
swaying
her
body
slightly
keeping
motion
with
her
foot
what
is
the
woman
name
bacchus
asked
weston
in
a
low
tone
i
axed
her
dis
mornin
sir
its
sarah
sarah
mills
weston
walked
up
nearer
to
her
and
was
regarding
her
when
she
suddenly
looked
up
into
his
face
finding
herself
observed
she
made
an
effort
to
look
unconcerned
but
it
did
not
succeed
for
she
burst
into
tears
i
sorry
to
see
you
here
sarah
said
weston
you
look
too
respectable
to
be
in
such
a
situation
sarah
smoothed
down
her
apron
but
did
not
reply
what
induced
you
to
run
away
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
answer
me
truthfully
i
will
not
do
you
any
harm
my
blessed
grief
said
bacchus
no
master
could
do
no
harm
to
a
flea
hush
bacchus
said
weston
there
was
something
in
weston
appearance
that
could
not
be
mistaken
the
woman
gave
him
a
look
of
perfect
confidence
and
said
i
thought
i
could
better
myself
sir
in
what
respect
had
you
an
unkind
master
said
weston
no
said
the
woman
but
my
husband
i
was
afear
might
be
sold
and
i
thought
i
could
make
so
much
money
at
the
north
that
i
could
soon
help
him
to
buy
himself
he
a
barber
sir
lives
on
the
avenue
and
his
master
when
he
was
young
had
him
taught
the
barber
trade
well
his
master
told
him
some
time
ago
that
he
might
live
to
himself
and
pay
him
so
much
a
month
out
o
what
he
made
but
seemed
as
if
he
could
get
along
to
do
it
my
husband
sir
drinks
a
good
deal
and
he
could
do
it
on
that
account
so
a
year
or
two
ago
his
master
sent
for
him
and
told
him
that
he
was
worthless
and
unless
he
could
buy
himself
in
three
years
he
would
sell
him
he
said
he
might
have
himself
for
five
hundred
dollars
and
he
could
have
earned
it
if
he
had
loved
whiskey
so
but
as
if
he
ca
do
without
that
we
aint
got
no
children
thank
god
so
when
the
abolitionists
advised
me
to
go
off
and
told
me
they
would
take
care
of
me
until
i
got
out
of
my
master
reach
and
i
could
soon
make
a
sight
of
money
to
buy
my
husband
i
thought
i
would
go
and
you
see
sir
what
come
of
it
sarah
tried
to
assume
the
same
look
of
unconcern
and
again
she
wept
bitterly
i
do
mean
to
reproach
you
now
that
you
are
in
trouble
said
weston
but
you
colored
people
in
this
city
have
got
into
bad
hands
god
has
made
you
slaves
and
you
should
be
willing
to
abide
by
his
will
especially
if
he
give
you
a
good
master
yes
sir
it
was
mighty
hard
though
to
think
of
my
poor
husband
being
sold
he
and
i
do
belong
to
the
same
person
so
i
suppose
said
weston
but
you
have
only
made
your
condition
worse
yes
sir
but
i
did
think
things
would
turn
out
so
the
abolitionists
said
they
would
see
that
i
got
off
free
they
ought
to
be
cotched
and
tied
up
and
have
a
good
whaling
besides
said
bacchus
indignantly
no
use
wishin
harm
said
sarah
the
lord
will
be
done
at
the
same
time
her
pale
lips
quivered
with
emotion
weston
paused
a
few
moments
in
deep
thought
then
went
into
the
other
room
when
he
returned
she
was
sitting
as
when
he
first
entered
her
face
buried
in
her
lap
sarah
he
said
and
she
looked
up
as
before
without
any
doubt
in
his
open
countenance
are
you
a
good
worker
i
am
at
washin
and
ironin
i
have
been
makin
a
good
deal
for
my
master
that
way
well
said
weston
if
i
were
to
purchase
you
so
as
you
could
be
near
your
husband
would
you
conduct
yourself
properly
and
if
i
wish
it
endeavor
to
repay
me
what
i
have
given
for
you
such
a
thought
had
not
entered
the
despairing
woman
mind
she
was
impressed
with
the
idea
that
she
should
never
see
her
husband
again
other
things
did
not
effect
her
it
was
necessary
therefore
for
weston
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
before
she
comprehended
his
meaning
when
she
heard
and
understood
every
energy
of
her
soul
was
aroused
starting
from
her
seat
she
clasped
her
hands
convulsively
together
her
face
became
deathlike
with
agitation
would
i
sir
oh
try
me
work
what
is
work
if
i
could
be
near
my
poor
husband
as
long
as
i
can
buy
me
sir
only
for
jesus
sake
buy
me
i
will
work
day
and
night
to
pay
you
and
the
blessing
of
god
almighty
will
pay
you
too
better
than
any
money
i
could
earn
bacchus
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
looked
earnestly
at
his
master
face
buy
her
master
buy
her
for
the
love
of
god
he
said
sarah
said
weston
i
do
not
like
to
be
in
a
public
place
do
not
therefore
become
excited
and
say
any
thing
that
will
draw
observation
to
me
i
have
bought
you
and
i
will
not
require
you
to
repay
me
come
to
me
at
willard
and
i
will
give
you
your
free
papers
i
will
see
also
what
i
can
do
for
your
husband
in
the
mean
time
bacchus
will
help
you
take
your
things
from
this
place
stay
here
though
a
few
moments
until
he
gets
me
a
carriage
to
go
home
in
and
he
will
return
to
you
sarah
perfectly
understood
that
weston
wanted
no
thanks
at
that
time
with
streaming
eyes
now
raised
to
heaven
now
to
her
benefactor
she
held
her
peace
weston
gladly
left
the
dreadful
place
bacchus
assisted
him
to
a
hack
and
then
came
back
to
fulfil
his
directions
as
regards
the
woman
oh
noble
heart
not
here
thy
reward
thy
weak
and
trembling
frame
attests
too
well
that
the
scene
is
too
trying
to
afford
thee
pleasure
the
eye
is
bent
upon
thee
and
thine
own
ear
will
hear
the
commendation
from
the
lips
of
christ
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
the
least
of
these
my
brethren
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
nor
thou
alone
many
a
generous
act
is
done
by
the
slaveholder
to
the
slave
god
will
remember
them
though
here
they
be
forgotten
or
unknown
we
need
not
dwell
on
the
meeting
between
sarah
and
her
husband
nor
on
bacchus
description
of
it
to
his
master
it
suffices
to
close
the
relation
of
this
incident
by
saying
that
at
night
sarah
came
to
receive
directions
from
weston
but
in
their
place
he
gave
her
the
necessary
free
papers
you
are
your
own
mistress
now
sarah
said
he
i
hope
you
will
prove
yourself
worthy
to
be
so
you
can
assist
your
husband
to
pay
for
himself
if
you
are
honest
and
industrious
you
can
not
fail
to
do
well
sarah
heart
overflowed
with
happiness
she
thanked
weston
over
and
over
again
until
fearing
to
be
troublesome
she
withdrew
bacchus
went
as
far
as
the
corner
and
promised
to
look
in
upon
herself
and
husband
repeatedly
which
he
did
he
impressed
his
new
acquaintances
with
a
proper
sense
of
his
own
importance
with
the
exception
of
one
grand
spree
that
he
and
sarah
husband
had
together
the
three
enjoyed
a
very
pleasant
and
harmonious
intercourse
during
the
remainder
of
the
westons
stay
at
washington
the
gay
winter
had
passed
and
spring
had
replaced
it
but
night
after
night
saw
the
votaries
of
fashion
assembled
though
many
of
them
looked
rather
the
worse
for
wear
ellen
and
alice
tired
of
scenes
which
varied
so
little
yet
having
no
regular
employment
they
hardly
knew
how
to
cease
the
round
of
amusements
that
occupied
them
ellen
said
never
mind
alice
we
will
have
plenty
of
time
for
repentance
and
we
might
as
well
quaff
to
the
last
drop
the
cup
of
pleasure
which
may
never
be
offered
to
our
lips
again
very
soon
they
were
to
return
to
virginia
and
now
they
proposed
visiting
places
of
interest
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
city
one
morning
after
a
gay
party
and
at
a
later
hour
than
usual
the
three
ladies
entered
the
weston
was
waiting
for
them
well
young
ladies
he
said
i
have
read
my
paper
and
now
i
am
ready
to
hear
you
give
an
account
of
your
last
evening
triumphs
the
winter
campaign
is
closing
every
little
skirmish
is
then
of
the
greatest
importance
how
do
you
all
feel
i
do
not
know
how
i
feel
uncle
said
alice
languidly
alice
has
expressed
my
feelings
exactly
and
weston
too
i
fancy
said
ellen
weston
smiled
but
said
he
should
not
excuse
them
from
their
promise
of
giving
him
a
faithful
description
of
the
scene
well
my
dear
sir
said
ellen
i
have
a
decided
talent
for
description
but
remember
weston
my
genius
must
not
be
cramped
do
not
break
the
thread
of
my
discourse
by
do
not
talk
so
a
washington
party
is
what
you
have
called
it
weston
a
skirmish
you
remember
how
the
wind
blew
last
night
when
we
reached
front
door
the
people
had
collected
in
such
crowds
in
the
hall
to
get
a
little
air
that
it
was
fully
ten
minutes
before
we
could
get
in
we
had
the
benefit
of
a
strong
harsh
breeze
playing
about
our
undefended
necks
and
shoulders
as
soon
as
we
were
fairly
in
though
we
were
recompensed
for
our
sufferings
in
this
respect
we
went
from
the
arctic
to
the
torrid
zone
it
was
like
an
august
day
at
two
we
tried
to
make
our
way
to
the
lady
of
the
house
but
understood
after
a
long
search
that
she
had
been
pushed
by
the
crowd
to
the
third
story
and
being
a
very
fat
person
was
seen
at
the
last
accounts
seated
in
a
fanning
herself
violently
and
calling
in
vain
for
after
a
while
we
reached
the
where
in
a
very
confined
circle
a
number
were
waltzing
and
as
this
is
a
forbidden
dance
to
alice
and
me
we
had
a
fine
opportunity
of
taking
notes
was
making
a
great
exhibition
of
herself
she
puffed
and
blew
as
if
she
had
the
asthma
her
ringlets
streamed
and
her
flounces
flew
i
was
immensely
anxious
for
the
little
lieutenant
her
partner
he
was
invisible
several
times
lost
in
the
ringlets
and
the
flounces
there
were
people
of
all
sizes
and
ages
dancing
for
a
wager
i
thought
of
what
our
good
bishop
once
said
was
very
pretty
to
see
the
young
lambs
gambolling
about
but
when
the
old
sheep
began
to
caper
too
he
rather
not
look
on
there
was
poor
old
with
his
red
face
and
his
white
hair
and
his
heels
flying
in
every
direction
i
am
ashamed
of
you
for
laughing
at
weston
when
i
am
trying
to
impress
upon
alice
mind
the
folly
of
such
a
scene
i
dare
say
wife
was
at
that
very
moment
five
hundred
miles
off
darning
her
children
stockings
all
the
people
did
not
dance
the
polka
continued
ellen
and
i
was
dazzled
with
the
pretty
faces
and
the
heads
webster
was
there
with
his
deep
voice
and
solemn
brow
and
cavernous
eyes
and
close
up
to
him
where
she
could
not
move
or
breathe
there
was
a
young
face
beautiful
and
innocent
as
a
cherub
looking
with
unfeigned
astonishment
upon
the
scene
there
was
scott
towering
above
everybody
and
douglass
edging
his
way
looking
kindly
and
pleasantly
at
every
one
there
were
artists
and
courtiers
soldiers
and
sailors
foolish
men
beautiful
women
and
sensible
women
though
i
do
not
know
what
they
wanted
there
there
were
specimens
of
every
kind
in
this
menagerie
of
men
and
women
dear
weston
i
have
not
quite
done
there
was
a
lady
writer
with
a
faded
pink
scarf
and
some
old
artificial
flowers
in
her
hair
there
was
she
abolitionist
yes
a
genuine
female
abolitionist
she
writes
for
the
abolition
papers
she
considers
southerners
heathens
looks
pityingly
at
the
waiters
as
they
hand
her
she
wants
frederick
douglass
to
be
the
next
president
and
advocates
amalgamation
i
am
quite
out
of
breath
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
looked
at
her
and
thought
uncle
bacchus
would
just
suit
her
with
his
airs
and
graces
but
i
do
not
think
she
is
stylish
enough
for
him
but
my
dear
said
weston
you
forget
bacchus
has
a
wife
and
twelve
children
that
is
not
of
the
least
consequence
my
dear
madam
said
ellen
i
can
imagine
when
a
woman
approves
of
amalgamation
she
is
so
lost
to
every
sense
of
propriety
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
her
whether
a
man
is
married
or
not
now
alice
i
resign
my
post
and
if
you
have
any
thing
to
say
i
will
give
you
the
chair
while
i
run
up
to
my
room
and
write
aunt
a
good
long
letter
chapter
xxiv
the
afternoon
is
so
delightful
said
weston
that
we
had
better
take
our
ride
to
the
congress
burial
ground
your
time
is
short
young
ladies
you
can
not
afford
to
lose
any
of
it
if
all
your
plans
are
to
be
carried
out
the
ladies
gladly
agreed
to
go
and
were
not
long
in
their
preparation
mark
was
a
perfect
prince
of
a
driver
when
the
ladies
had
occasion
to
go
into
the
country
he
entreated
them
to
hire
a
carriage
but
he
was
always
ready
to
display
his
handsome
equipage
and
horses
in
the
city
especially
on
the
avenue
he
drove
slowly
this
afternoon
and
weston
remembered
as
she
approached
harper
that
she
had
one
or
two
purchases
to
make
fearing
it
might
be
late
on
their
return
she
proposed
getting
out
for
a
few
moments
a
stream
of
people
crowded
the
pavements
the
exquisite
weather
had
drawn
them
out
belles
with
their
ringlets
and
and
beaux
with
canes
and
curled
moustaches
irish
women
in
tawdry
finery
and
of
color
with
every
variety
of
ornament
and
ridiculous
imitation
of
fashion
now
and
then
a
negro
would
pass
turning
out
of
the
way
instead
of
jostling
along
truly
said
weston
pennsylvania
avenue
is
the
great
bazaar
of
america
here
are
senators
and
members
three
and
four
walking
arm
in
arm
here
are
gay
young
men
dressed
in
the
latest
style
here
is
the
army
and
navy
button
old
people
and
young
children
with
their
nurses
foreigners
and
natives
people
of
every
shade
and
hue
there
is
our
president
walking
unattended
as
a
republican
president
should
walk
and
see
there
are
a
number
of
indians
men
and
a
white
boy
throwing
a
stone
at
them
i
wish
i
had
the
young
rascal
on
our
right
in
their
carriages
are
the
wives
and
children
of
the
rich
while
scattered
about
right
and
left
are
the
representatives
of
the
poor
but
what
is
this
coming
along
the
the
girls
put
their
heads
out
of
the
window
and
saw
a
colored
man
sauntering
along
in
an
impudent
manner
his
dress
indeed
his
whole
appearance
was
absurd
he
wore
a
stylish
shiny
black
hat
the
rim
slightly
turned
up
in
front
following
the
direction
of
the
wearer
nose
which
had
set
its
affections
on
things
above
his
whiskers
were
immense
so
were
his
moustaches
and
that
other
hairy
trimming
which
it
is
the
fashion
to
wear
about
the
jaws
and
chin
and
for
which
i
know
no
better
name
than
that
which
the
children
give
goatee
a
tremendous
shirt
collar
brass
studs
in
his
bosom
a
neck
handkerchief
of
many
colors
the
ends
of
which
stood
out
like
the
extended
wings
of
a
butterfly
a
gorgeous
watch
chain
white
kid
gloves
pantaloons
of
a
plaid
and
fitting
so
very
tightly
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
could
put
out
his
feet
patent
leather
and
a
cane
that
he
flourished
right
and
left
with
such
determined
strokes
that
the
children
kept
carefully
out
of
his
way
several
persons
looked
back
to
wonder
and
laugh
at
this
strange
figure
the
drollery
of
which
was
greatly
enhanced
by
his
limber
style
of
walking
and
a
certain
expression
of
the
whole
outer
man
which
said
who
says
i
am
not
as
good
as
anybody
on
this
avenue
fillmore
or
any
one
else
now
it
happened
that
walking
from
the
other
direction
toward
this
representative
of
the
colored
race
was
a
stranger
who
had
come
to
washington
to
look
about
him
he
was
from
philadelphia
but
not
thinking
a
great
deal
of
what
he
saw
in
our
capital
on
a
former
visit
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
that
there
was
nothing
to
make
it
worth
his
while
to
come
again
but
hearing
of
the
convalescing
turn
the
city
had
taken
since
the
immortal
supporters
of
the
compromise
and
the
fugitive
slave
law
had
brought
comparative
harmony
and
peace
where
there
had
been
nought
but
disorder
and
confusion
he
suddenly
fancied
to
come
and
see
for
himself
he
was
not
an
abolitionist
nor
a
secessionist
nor
one
of
those
unfortunate
restless
people
who
are
forever
stirring
up
old
difficulties
he
had
an
idea
that
the
union
ought
to
be
preserved
in
the
first
place
and
then
whatever
else
could
be
done
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
human
race
in
general
without
injury
to
our
national
interests
should
be
attended
to
he
was
always
a
man
and
was
particularly
pleasant
this
afternoon
having
on
an
entire
new
suit
of
clothes
each
article
even
the
fitting
in
the
most
faultless
manner
as
he
walked
along
he
noticed
the
colored
man
advancing
towards
him
and
observed
too
what
i
forgot
to
mention
that
he
held
a
cigar
and
every
now
and
then
put
it
to
his
mouth
emitting
afterwards
a
perfect
cloud
of
smoke
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
the
man
did
not
intend
to
turn
out
of
the
way
for
anybody
and
as
they
were
in
a
line
he
determined
not
to
deviate
one
way
or
the
other
but
just
observe
what
this
favorite
of
fashion
would
do
they
walked
on
and
in
a
minute
came
up
to
each
other
the
colored
man
not
giving
way
in
the
least
but
bumping
hat
goatee
cane
cigar
and
all
against
our
philadelphian
who
with
the
greatest
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
doubled
up
his
fist
and
giving
the
colored
adonis
two
blows
with
it
precisely
on
the
middle
brass
stud
which
confined
his
frilled
laid
him
full
length
upon
the
pavement
now
said
the
philadelphian
you
had
a
lesson
the
next
time
you
see
a
gentleman
coming
along
turn
out
of
the
way
for
him
and
you
save
your
new
clothes
without
another
glance
at
the
discomfited
beau
who
was
brushing
his
plaid
pantaloons
with
his
and
muttering
some
equivocal
language
that
would
not
do
here
he
went
on
his
way
to
see
the
improvements
about
the
city
hall
mark
low
laugh
was
heard
from
the
driver
seat
and
bacchus
who
was
waiting
to
open
the
carriage
door
for
weston
stood
on
the
first
step
and
touching
his
hat
said
with
a
broad
grin
dat
de
best
thing
seen
sence
we
come
to
washington
dat
beats
ole
virginny
weston
came
from
the
store
at
the
same
moment
and
bacchus
gallantly
let
down
the
steps
and
after
securing
the
door
took
his
place
beside
mark
with
the
agility
of
a
boy
of
sixteen
weston
much
amused
described
the
scene
weston
declared
it
served
him
right
for
that
the
negroes
were
getting
intolerable
i
can
hardly
believe
she
said
the
change
that
has
been
made
in
their
appearance
and
conduct
they
think
to
obtain
respect
they
must
be
impertinent
this
is
the
effect
of
abolition
yes
said
weston
this
is
abolition
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
on
the
condition
of
the
negroes
in
our
country
of
late
i
would
like
to
see
every
man
and
woman
that
god
has
made
free
could
it
be
accomplished
to
their
advantage
i
see
the
evils
of
slavery
it
is
sometimes
a
curse
on
the
master
as
well
as
the
slave
when
i
purchased
sarah
when
i
saw
those
grieving
throbbing
souls
my
own
was
overwhelmed
with
sympathy
for
them
this
is
slavery
i
said
to
myself
poor
creatures
though
you
have
done
wrong
how
severe
your
punishment
to
be
separated
from
all
that
your
life
has
had
to
make
it
pleasant
or
even
tolerable
this
is
slavery
indeed
and
where
is
the
man
come
from
god
who
will
show
us
a
remedy
i
look
at
the
free
blacks
of
the
north
and
south
i
say
again
this
is
abolition
how
worthless
how
degraded
they
are
after
they
imbibe
these
ridiculous
notions
when
i
behold
the
southern
country
and
am
convinced
that
it
is
to
manumit
the
slaves
i
conclude
that
here
at
least
they
are
in
their
natural
condition
heretofore
i
feel
that
i
have
only
done
my
duty
in
retaining
mine
while
i
give
them
every
means
of
comfort
and
innocent
enjoyment
that
is
in
my
power
now
i
have
seen
the
result
of
the
abolition
efforts
i
am
convinced
that
my
duty
has
been
and
will
be
as
i
have
said
could
they
be
colonized
from
virginia
i
would
willingly
consent
to
it
as
in
our
climate
white
labor
would
answer
but
south
the
can
labor
and
this
is
an
unanswerable
objection
to
our
southern
states
becoming
free
those
servants
that
are
free
the
benevolent
and
generous
abolitionists
ought
to
take
north
build
them
colleges
and
make
good
to
them
all
the
promises
they
held
out
as
baits
to
allure
them
from
their
owners
and
their
duties
weston
found
he
had
not
two
very
attentive
listeners
in
the
young
ladies
for
they
were
returning
the
many
salutations
they
received
and
making
remarks
on
their
numerous
acquaintances
the
carriage
began
slowly
to
ascend
capitol
hill
and
they
all
remarked
the
beautiful
prospect
to
which
washingtonians
are
so
much
accustomed
that
they
are
too
apt
not
to
notice
it
their
ride
was
delightful
it
was
one
of
those
lovely
spring
days
when
the
air
is
still
fresh
and
balmy
and
the
promise
of
a
sun
lights
up
nature
so
joyfully
there
were
many
visitors
at
the
and
there
had
been
several
funerals
that
day
a
woman
stood
at
the
door
of
the
house
at
the
entrance
of
the
cemetery
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
another
child
of
two
years
old
was
playing
around
a
large
bier
that
had
been
left
there
until
it
should
be
wanted
again
weston
met
with
an
acquaintance
soon
after
they
entered
the
ground
and
they
stopped
to
converse
while
weston
and
the
younger
ladies
walked
on
near
a
large
vault
they
stopped
a
moment
surprised
to
see
two
or
three
little
boys
playing
at
marbles
they
were
ruddy
boys
marking
out
places
in
the
gravel
path
for
the
game
shooting
laughing
and
winning
and
so
much
occupied
that
if
death
himself
had
come
along
on
his
pale
horse
they
would
have
asked
him
to
wait
a
while
till
they
could
let
him
pass
if
indeed
they
had
seen
him
at
all
weston
tried
to
address
them
several
times
but
they
could
not
attend
to
him
until
the
game
was
completed
when
one
of
them
sprang
upon
the
vault
and
began
to
count
over
his
marbles
and
the
others
sat
down
on
a
low
monument
to
rest
boys
said
weston
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
you
playing
marbles
in
a
do
you
see
all
these
graves
around
you
we
do
go
on
the
dead
people
said
an
little
fellow
you
see
the
grass
is
wet
there
we
play
here
in
the
walk
where
its
nice
and
dry
but
you
ought
to
play
outside
said
weston
this
is
too
sacred
a
place
to
be
made
the
scene
of
your
amusements
we
do
hurt
any
body
said
the
largest
boy
when
people
are
dead
they
do
hear
nothin
where
the
harm
well
said
weston
there
one
thing
certain
none
of
you
have
any
friends
buried
here
if
you
had
you
would
not
treat
them
so
unkindly
my
mother
is
buried
over
yonder
said
the
boy
on
the
vault
and
if
i
thought
there
was
any
thing
unkind
in
it
i
would
never
come
here
to
play
again
you
are
a
good
boy
said
weston
i
hope
you
will
keep
your
word
if
you
were
buried
there
i
am
sure
your
mother
would
be
very
sad
and
quiet
by
your
grave
the
boy
drew
the
string
to
his
bag
and
walked
off
without
looking
back
i
wish
said
weston
you
would
all
follow
his
example
we
should
always
be
respectful
in
our
conduct
when
we
are
in
a
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
the
boys
laughed
and
marked
out
another
game
weston
joined
her
party
and
they
went
towards
the
new
portion
of
the
cemetery
that
is
so
beautifully
situated
near
the
river
i
think
said
weston
this
scene
should
remind
us
of
our
conversation
this
morning
if
washington
be
the
of
all
living
it
is
the
grand
cemetery
of
the
dead
look
around
us
here
we
see
monuments
to
senators
and
members
graves
of
foreigners
and
strangers
names
of
the
great
the
rich
the
powerful
men
of
genius
and
ambition
strewed
along
are
the
poor
the
lowly
the
unlearned
the
infant
and
the
little
child
read
the
inscriptions
death
has
come
at
last
watched
and
waited
for
or
he
has
come
suddenly
unexpected
and
undesired
there
lies
an
author
a
bride
a
statesman
side
by
side
a
little
farther
off
is
that
simple
but
beautiful
monument
they
approached
and
alice
read
the
line
that
was
inscribed
around
a
cross
sculptured
in
it
other
refuge
have
i
none
underneath
was
her
name
angeline
how
beautiful
how
much
more
so
in
its
simplicity
than
if
it
had
been
ornamented
and
a
labored
epitaph
written
upon
it
said
weston
here
too
are
members
of
families
assembled
in
one
great
family
as
we
walk
along
we
pass
mothers
and
husbands
and
children
but
in
life
they
who
lie
here
together
were
possibly
all
strangers
what
is
that
large
vault
open
for
said
ellen
to
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
some
charge
in
the
place
that
is
the
public
receptacle
said
the
man
we
are
obliged
to
air
it
very
often
else
we
could
never
go
in
and
out
with
the
coffins
we
put
there
there
a
good
many
in
there
now
who
is
there
said
weston
well
said
the
man
madison
is
there
for
one
and
there
are
some
other
people
who
are
going
to
be
moved
soon
madison
she
going
to
be
moved
too
some
time
or
another
but
i
do
know
when
ellen
stooped
down
and
looked
in
but
arose
quickly
and
turned
away
two
gentlemen
were
standing
near
observing
her
and
one
of
them
smiled
as
she
stepped
back
from
the
vault
weston
knew
this
person
by
sight
he
was
a
clergyman
of
great
talent
and
almost
equal
eccentricity
and
often
gave
offence
by
harshness
of
manner
when
he
was
only
anxious
to
do
good
to
the
cause
in
which
his
heart
was
absorbed
ah
young
ladies
he
said
looking
kindly
at
them
both
this
is
a
good
place
for
you
to
come
to
you
are
both
beautiful
and
it
may
be
wealthy
and
i
doubt
not
in
the
enjoyments
of
the
passing
season
you
have
forgotten
all
about
death
and
the
grave
but
look
you
in
there
lies
the
mortal
remains
of
madison
what
an
influence
she
had
in
this
gay
society
which
you
have
doubtless
adorned
her
presence
was
the
guarantee
of
propriety
as
well
as
of
social
and
fashionable
enjoyment
the
very
contrast
that
she
presented
to
her
husband
made
her
more
charming
always
anxious
to
please
she
was
constantly
making
others
happy
she
gave
assistance
and
encouragement
to
all
when
it
was
in
her
power
she
had
more
political
influence
than
any
woman
in
our
country
has
had
before
or
since
but
think
of
her
now
you
could
not
bear
to
approach
the
coffin
that
contains
her
remains
where
is
her
beauty
and
her
grace
and
talent
ah
young
ladies
he
continued
did
she
rightly
use
those
talents
it
is
hardly
a
fair
question
to
ask
now
said
weston
let
us
tread
lightly
the
ashes
of
the
dead
let
the
living
learn
a
lesson
from
the
dead
said
the
clergyman
sternly
you
are
leading
it
may
be
a
heartless
life
of
pleasure
but
young
ladies
forget
not
this
grave
she
could
not
escape
it
nor
will
you
pause
from
your
balls
and
your
theatres
and
your
gay
doings
and
ask
what
is
the
end
of
it
all
trifle
not
with
the
inestimable
gift
of
life
be
not
dead
while
you
live
anticipate
not
the
great
destroyer
hear
the
appeal
of
one
who
was
once
the
idol
of
every
heart
she
speaks
to
you
from
the
grave
as
i
am
shalt
thou
be
he
turned
from
them
and
wandered
over
the
ground
weston
led
the
way
to
the
carriage
and
ellen
and
alice
thought
that
if
a
lesson
of
life
was
to
be
learned
in
the
gay
ball
of
the
night
before
a
still
more
necessary
one
was
found
in
the
cemetery
which
they
were
now
leaving
as
the
shadows
of
the
evening
were
on
the
simple
monument
and
the
sculptured
slab
and
their
silent
tenants
slept
on
undisturbed
by
the
gambols
of
thoughtless
children
or
the
conversation
of
the
many
who
came
to
visit
their
abode
the
next
morning
bacchus
brought
no
letter
for
weston
but
one
for
each
lady
for
ellen
from
her
aunt
for
alice
from
arthur
and
cousin
janet
handwriting
was
easily
recognized
on
the
outside
of
weston
hardly
had
the
girls
arisen
from
the
table
to
take
theirs
to
their
rooms
for
a
quiet
perusal
when
an
exclamation
from
weston
detained
them
is
anything
the
matter
at
home
anna
said
weston
is
cousin
janet
cousin
janet
is
well
my
dear
brother
said
weston
i
was
very
thoughtless
but
our
dear
neighbor
kent
is
no
more
can
it
be
possible
said
weston
much
agitated
read
the
letter
aloud
weston
turned
to
the
beginning
and
read
aloud
my
dear
anna
the
time
is
near
which
will
bring
you
all
in
health
and
happiness
i
trust
to
your
home
and
could
you
see
how
lovely
it
looks
i
think
you
would
be
tempted
to
fix
upon
an
earlier
day
you
see
how
selfish
i
am
but
i
confess
that
i
quite
count
the
days
as
a
child
does
to
christmas
and
am
ashamed
of
my
impatience
throughout
the
winter
i
had
no
care
my
kind
friends
did
all
the
housekeeping
and
the
servants
in
the
house
and
on
the
plantation
were
so
faithful
that
i
feel
indebted
to
all
who
have
made
my
time
so
easy
and
your
absence
has
not
i
am
sure
been
attended
with
any
ill
effects
without
you
find
me
a
little
cross
and
complaining
and
barbour
out
of
his
senses
with
joy
on
your
return
good
barbour
he
has
superintended
and
encouraged
the
servants
and
visited
us
forlorn
ladies
frequently
so
that
he
must
come
in
for
a
portion
of
our
thanks
too
you
will
perhaps
think
i
ought
only
to
write
you
cheerful
news
but
it
is
best
to
let
you
know
as
well
as
i
can
the
condition
that
you
will
find
us
in
on
your
return
phillis
is
the
only
one
of
us
whose
concerns
are
of
any
immediate
importance
but
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
that
she
is
now
seriously
indisposed
her
cough
has
never
really
yielded
her
other
symptoms
have
varied
but
for
the
last
few
weeks
her
disease
has
not
only
progressed
but
assumed
a
certain
form
she
is
in
consumption
and
has
no
doubt
inherited
the
disease
from
her
mother
i
have
throughout
the
winter
felt
great
anxiety
about
her
and
have
not
permitted
her
to
work
though
sometimes
i
found
it
hard
to
prevent
her
her
children
have
been
constantly
with
her
indeed
i
have
passed
a
great
deal
of
my
own
time
in
her
cabin
which
under
martha
superintendence
is
so
neat
and
comfortable
you
will
all
perhaps
blame
me
that
i
have
not
been
thus
plain
with
you
before
but
lawton
said
it
was
not
necessary
as
she
has
never
been
in
any
immediate
danger
and
phillis
would
not
consent
to
my
doing
so
she
wanted
you
to
enjoy
yourselves
and
alice
to
have
a
good
chance
to
regain
her
health
doubt
miss
janet
she
said
lord
will
spare
me
to
see
them
yet
and
i
have
every
thing
i
want
now
they
could
stop
my
pains
any
more
than
you
and
i
feel
that
i
am
in
the
lord
hands
and
i
am
content
to
be
she
has
not
been
confined
to
her
bed
but
is
fast
losing
strength
though
from
my
window
now
i
see
her
tying
up
her
roses
that
are
beginning
to
bud
some
other
hand
than
hers
will
care
for
them
when
another
spring
shall
come
her
nights
are
very
restless
and
she
is
much
exhausted
from
constant
spitting
of
blood
the
last
week
of
pleasant
weather
has
been
of
service
to
her
and
the
prospect
of
seeing
you
all
at
home
gives
her
the
most
unfeigned
pleasure
i
have
even
more
painful
intelligence
to
give
you
our
young
neighbor
kent
has
done
with
all
her
trials
and
i
trust
they
sanctified
her
in
preparation
for
the
early
and
unexpected
death
which
has
been
her
lot
you
are
not
yet
aware
of
the
extent
of
her
trials
a
fortnight
ago
her
little
boy
was
attacked
with
scarlet
fever
in
its
most
violent
form
from
the
first
moment
of
his
illness
his
case
was
hopeless
and
he
only
suffered
hours
i
went
over
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
his
death
the
poor
mother
condition
was
really
pitiable
she
was
helpless
in
her
sorrow
which
was
so
unexpected
as
to
deprive
her
at
first
of
the
power
of
reason
the
good
shepherd
though
had
not
forgotten
her
he
told
her
that
he
had
taken
her
little
lamb
and
had
gently
folded
it
in
his
bosom
and
that
he
would
wander
with
it
in
the
lovely
pastures
of
paradise
she
was
soon
perfectly
reconciled
to
the
sad
dispensation
sad
indeed
for
the
child
was
her
only
earthly
solace
victim
of
an
unhappy
marriage
the
dear
engaging
little
boy
was
a
great
consolation
to
her
and
his
amusement
and
instruction
occupied
her
mind
and
passed
away
happily
many
a
weary
hour
she
insisted
upon
attending
the
funeral
and
i
accompanied
her
kent
was
with
her
too
much
distressed
for
this
hard
man
loved
his
child
and
keenly
felt
his
loss
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
to
hear
the
funeral
service
read
and
was
calm
until
they
took
up
the
coffin
to
lower
it
into
the
grave
then
it
was
impossible
to
control
her
placing
her
arms
upon
it
she
looked
around
appealingly
to
the
men
and
so
affected
were
they
that
they
turned
from
her
to
wipe
away
their
own
tears
her
strength
gave
way
under
the
excitement
and
she
was
carried
insensible
to
the
carriage
and
taken
home
i
found
her
very
feverish
and
did
not
like
to
leave
her
thinking
it
probable
that
she
might
also
have
the
disease
which
had
carried
off
her
child
before
night
she
became
really
ill
and
lawton
pronounced
her
complaint
scarlet
fever
the
disease
was
fearfully
rapid
and
soon
ended
her
life
she
was
i
think
well
prepared
to
go
her
solemn
and
affectionate
farewell
to
her
husband
can
not
fail
to
make
an
impression
upon
him
i
shall
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
of
her
when
you
return
the
past
winter
has
been
a
sad
one
a
constant
coolness
existing
between
her
and
her
husband
a
short
time
ago
he
was
brutally
striking
that
faithful
old
man
of
her
father
robert
and
kent
interfered
insisting
upon
robert
returning
to
his
cabin
and
in
his
presence
forbidding
kent
again
to
raise
his
hand
against
one
servant
on
the
plantation
carter
will
allowing
kent
no
authority
over
his
servants
and
commending
them
to
his
daughter
kindness
and
care
showed
great
discrimination
of
character
this
though
has
been
a
constant
source
of
irritation
to
kent
and
he
has
never
been
kind
to
the
people
kent
usually
so
timid
was
roused
into
anger
by
his
treatment
of
robert
and
interfered
as
i
have
related
to
you
she
told
me
of
this
and
said
how
unhappy
it
had
made
her
though
she
could
not
blame
herself
since
then
there
has
only
been
a
formal
politeness
between
them
kent
not
forgiving
his
wife
for
the
part
she
took
against
him
poor
little
woman
robert
had
been
her
father
faithful
nurse
in
his
long
illness
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
her
feelings
on
seeing
him
struck
yesterday
the
will
was
read
and
lawton
who
was
present
informed
us
of
the
result
kent
has
left
most
of
her
property
to
her
husband
but
her
servants
free
the
plantation
is
to
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
expended
in
preparing
those
who
are
willing
to
go
to
liberia
or
where
they
choose
as
they
can
not
manumitted
remain
in
virginia
the
older
servants
who
prefer
staying
in
virginia
as
they
are
she
has
left
to
you
with
an
allowance
for
their
support
considering
you
as
a
kind
of
guardian
for
in
no
other
way
could
she
have
provided
for
their
staying
here
which
they
will
like
better
who
would
have
thought
she
could
have
made
so
wise
a
will
lawton
says
that
kent
showed
extreme
anger
on
hearing
it
read
he
intends
returning
to
the
north
and
his
will
be
a
clear
gain
for
i
am
told
he
had
not
a
cent
when
he
married
her
write
me
when
you
have
fixed
the
time
for
your
return
and
believe
me
with
love
to
all
your
affectionate
relative
janet
wilmer
bacchus
entered
in
time
to
hear
the
latter
part
of
this
letter
he
had
his
master
boots
in
his
hands
when
weston
stopped
reading
he
said
that
good
bound
for
mister
kent
i
glad
he
gwine
like
judas
to
his
own
place
chapter
xxv
the
carriage
was
slowly
ascending
the
road
to
the
old
church
a
familiar
and
dear
object
to
each
member
of
the
weston
family
a
village
churchyard
fills
up
so
gradually
that
one
is
not
startled
with
a
sudden
change
weston
looked
from
the
window
at
the
ivy
and
the
gothic
windows
and
the
family
vault
where
many
of
his
name
reposed
the
inmates
of
the
carriage
had
been
conversing
cheerfully
but
as
they
approached
the
point
where
they
would
see
home
each
one
was
occupied
with
his
or
her
musings
occasionally
a
pleasant
word
was
exchanged
on
the
appearance
of
the
neighborhood
the
balmy
air
and
the
many
shades
of
green
that
the
trees
presented
some
of
them
loaded
with
white
and
pink
blossoms
promising
still
better
things
when
the
season
should
advance
alice
leaned
from
the
window
watching
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
house
she
greeted
every
tree
they
passed
with
a
lively
look
and
smiled
gaily
as
the
porter
lodge
presented
itself
the
gates
of
it
flew
open
as
the
carriage
approached
and
exeter
in
its
beauty
met
their
view
oh
uncle
she
said
turning
from
the
window
look
look
is
there
any
place
in
the
world
like
this
no
indeed
alice
and
he
took
a
survey
of
the
home
which
had
been
so
blessed
to
him
how
beautiful
every
thing
looks
and
how
we
will
enjoy
it
after
a
crowded
noisy
hotel
anna
you
are
not
sorry
to
see
its
familiar
face
again
ellen
my
darling
we
have
not
forgotten
you
exeter
is
your
home
too
you
are
as
welcome
as
any
of
us
why
you
look
sober
not
regretting
washington
already
no
sir
said
ellen
i
was
thinking
of
other
things
well
said
weston
we
must
look
very
happy
this
evening
i
wonder
ellen
barbour
has
not
met
us
i
suppose
said
alice
laughing
he
is
too
much
agitated
at
the
thought
of
meeting
ellen
again
he
will
be
over
this
evening
i
dare
say
i
am
sorry
i
ca
keep
my
word
with
barbour
said
ellen
but
i
have
concluded
to
marry
abel
johnson
on
arthur
recommendation
and
i
ought
not
to
give
good
barbour
any
false
expectations
you
must
know
dear
uncle
said
alice
that
ellen
and
arthur
have
been
carrying
on
a
postscript
correspondence
in
my
letters
and
arthur
has
turned
matchmaker
and
has
been
recommending
abel
johnson
to
ellen
they
have
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
without
having
met
and
that
was
the
reason
ellen
was
so
last
winter
ah
that
is
the
reason
but
you
must
take
care
of
these
yankee
husbands
miss
ellen
if
kent
be
a
specimen
said
weston
i
am
quite
sure
said
alice
arthur
would
not
have
such
a
friend
weston
smiled
and
looked
out
again
at
home
they
were
rapidly
approaching
the
gates
and
a
crowd
of
little
darkies
were
holding
them
open
on
each
side
i
wish
arthur
were
here
said
he
how
long
he
has
been
away
i
associate
him
with
every
object
about
the
place
alice
did
not
answer
arthur
was
in
her
thoughts
this
was
his
home
every
object
with
which
she
was
surrounded
breathed
of
him
she
had
thought
of
it
as
her
home
but
she
had
no
right
here
she
was
really
only
a
guest
the
thought
was
new
and
painful
to
her
could
the
whole
of
her
past
existence
have
been
dreamed
away
had
she
indeed
no
claim
to
the
place
she
loved
best
on
earth
was
she
dependant
on
the
will
of
others
for
all
the
gay
and
joyous
emotions
that
a
few
moments
before
filled
her
breast
she
thought
again
of
arthur
of
his
handsome
appearance
his
good
and
generous
heart
his
talents
and
his
unchanging
love
to
her
of
walter
and
of
all
with
which
he
had
had
to
contend
in
the
springtime
of
his
life
of
his
faults
his
sin
and
his
banishment
of
his
love
to
her
too
and
the
delusion
under
which
she
had
labored
of
her
returning
it
arthur
would
ere
long
know
it
all
and
though
he
might
forgive
her
proud
spirit
rebelled
at
the
idea
that
he
would
also
blame
she
looked
at
her
uncle
whose
happy
face
was
fixed
on
the
home
of
his
youth
and
his
old
age
a
sense
of
his
protecting
care
and
affection
came
over
her
what
might
the
short
summer
bring
his
displeasure
too
then
there
would
be
no
more
for
her
but
to
leave
exeter
with
all
its
happiness
poor
child
for
at
nearly
nineteen
alice
was
only
a
child
the
possibility
overpowered
her
she
leant
against
her
uncle
bosom
and
wept
suddenly
and
violently
alice
what
is
the
matter
said
her
mother
are
you
ill
what
the
matter
said
her
uncle
putting
his
arm
around
her
and
looking
alarmed
nothing
at
all
said
alice
trying
to
control
herself
i
was
only
thinking
of
all
your
goodness
to
me
and
how
i
love
you
is
that
all
said
weston
pressing
her
more
closely
to
his
bosom
why
the
sight
of
home
has
turned
your
little
head
come
dry
up
your
tears
for
my
old
eyes
can
distinguish
the
hall
door
and
the
servants
about
the
house
collecting
to
meet
us
i
can
see
dear
cousin
janet
standing
within
how
happy
she
will
be
said
weston
well
said
ellen
i
hope
abel
will
make
a
fuss
over
me
for
nobody
else
ever
has
if
you
are
to
be
married
said
alice
smiling
through
her
tears
you
must
have
his
name
changed
or
always
call
him
mr
johnson
never
said
ellen
i
have
a
perfect
passion
for
the
name
of
abel
there
was
a
picture
in
my
room
of
abel
lying
down
and
cain
standing
holding
the
club
over
him
whenever
i
got
into
a
passion
when
i
was
a
child
mammy
used
to
take
me
to
the
picture
and
say
there
honey
if
you
do
learn
how
to
get
the
better
of
your
temper
one
of
these
days
you
will
get
in
a
passion
like
cain
and
kill
somebody
just
look
at
him
how
ugly
he
is
because
he
in
such
a
rage
but
i
always
looked
at
abel
who
was
so
much
prettier
i
have
no
doubt
abel
johnson
looks
just
as
he
does
in
the
picture
they
were
about
to
pass
through
the
gates
leading
to
the
grounds
some
of
the
servants
approached
the
carriage
and
respectfully
bowing
said
home
master
but
passed
on
without
waiting
to
have
the
salutation
returned
weston
guessed
the
cause
of
there
not
being
a
general
outbreak
on
the
occasion
of
their
return
miss
janet
had
spoken
to
a
number
of
the
servants
telling
them
how
unable
weston
was
to
bear
any
excitement
and
that
he
would
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
seeing
them
all
at
their
cabins
as
he
was
much
attached
to
them
and
might
feel
a
good
deal
at
the
meeting
after
so
long
a
separation
it
would
be
better
not
to
give
him
a
noisy
welcome
she
had
however
excepted
the
children
in
this
prohibition
for
miss
janet
had
one
excellent
principle
in
the
management
of
children
she
never
forbade
them
doing
what
she
knew
they
could
not
help
doing
thus
as
the
carriage
passed
the
lodge
a
noisy
group
of
darkies
were
making
a
public
demonstration
massa
come
home
says
one
i
sees
miss
alice
says
another
i
sees
miss
anna
too
said
a
third
though
as
yet
not
a
face
was
visible
to
one
of
them
they
put
their
heads
out
of
the
carriage
notwithstanding
to
speak
to
them
and
alice
emptied
a
basket
of
which
she
had
bought
for
the
purpose
over
their
heads
take
care
mark
said
weston
do
cut
about
with
that
whip
while
all
these
children
are
so
near
if
i
did
sir
said
mark
some
of
would
a
been
scrunched
under
the
carriage
wheels

these
little
niggers
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
they
always
in
the
way
i
wish
some
of
would
get
run
over
mark
wife
was
not
a
very
amiable
character
and
she
had
never
had
any
children
hurrah

weston
looking
out

window
mammy
she
well
said
the
young
gentleman
how

well
i
thank

sir
said
weston
go
down
there
and
help
pick
up
the
bacchus
the
elder
now
slid
down
from
the
seat
by
mark
and
took
a
short
cut
over
to
his
cabin
poor
aunt
phillis
said
weston
looking
after
him
i
hope
she
will
get
well
ah
said
weston
i
had
forgotten
phillis
on
this
happy
day
there
is
something
you
see
anna
to
make
us
sigh
even
in
our
happiest
moments
but
you
shall
not
sigh
dearest
uncle
said
alice
kissing
his
hand
for
aunt
phillis
will
get
well
now
that
we
are
all
back
oh
there
is
cousin
janet
and
little
lydia
i
wish
the
carriage
would
stop
you
are
the
most
perfect
child
i
ever
saw
alice
said
weston
i
think
you
are
out
of
your
senses
at
the
idea
of
getting
home
the
carriage
wheeled
round
and
william
let
down
the
steps
with
a
face
bright
as
a
sunflower
miss
janet
stood
at
the
top
of
the
portico
steps
in
her
gown
and
her
handkerchief
with
open
arms
alice
bounded
like
a
deer
and
was
clasped
within
them
then
weston
then
ellen
and
afterwards
the
aged
relatives
warmly
embraced
each
other
little
lydia
was
not
forgotten
they
all
shook
hands
with
her
but
alice
who
stooped
to
kiss
her
smooth
black
cheek
william
was
then
regularly
shaken
hands
with
and
the
family
entered
the
large
airy
hall
and
were
indeed
at
home
here
were
collected
all
the
servants
employed
about
the
house
each
in
a
sunday
dress
each
greeted
with
a
kind
word
alice
shook
hands
with
them
two
or
three
times
over
then
pointing
to
the
family
pictures
which
were
arranged
along
the
hall
look
at
them
uncle
said
she
did
you
ever
see
them
so
smiling
before
they
went
to
the
all
but
alice
who
flew
off
in
another
direction
she
is
gone
to
see
phillis
said
weston
gazing
after
her
well
i
will
rest
a
few
moments
and
then
go
too
never
did
mother
hold
to
her
heart
a
child
dearer
to
her
than
phillis
when
she
pressed
alice
to
her
bosom
alice
had
almost
lived
with
her
when
she
and
walter
and
arthur
were
children
weston
knew
that
she
could
not
be
in
better
hands
than
under
the
care
of
so
faithful
and
respectable
a
servant
phillis
had
a
large
old
clothes
basket
where
she
kept
the
toys
all
the
little
plates
and
cups
with
which
they
played
the
dolls
without
noses
and
the
trumpets
that
would
not
blow
her
children
were
not
allowed
to
touch
them
when
the
owners
were
not
there
but
they
took
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
play
being
the
waiters
and
ladies
maids
and
of
the
little
gentlemen
and
alice
after
walter
and
arthur
went
away
alice
was
still
a
great
deal
with
phillis
and
she
regarding
her
as
arthur
future
wife
loved
her
for
him
as
well
as
for
herself
alice
loved
phillis
too
and
all
her
children
and
they
considered
her
as
a
little
above
mortality
bacchus
used
to
insist
when
she
was
a
child
that
she
never
would
live
she
was
when
during
her
severe
illness
phillis
would
go
to
her
cabin
to
look
around
bacchus
would
greet
her
with
a
very
long
face
and
say
i
told
you
so
i
know
miss
alice
would
be
took
from
us
all
since
her
recovery
he
had
stopped
prophesying
about
her
aunt
phillis
said
alice
you
do
look
very
sick
i
reckon
you
work
when
you
ought
not
now
i
intend
to
watch
you
and
make
you
mind
so
that
you
will
soon
be
well
i
am
a
great
deal
better
than
i
was
miss
alice
but
there
no
knowing
howsomever
i
thank
the
lord
that
he
has
spared
me
to
see
you
once
more
i
want
to
give
master
time
to
talk
to
miss
janet
a
little
while
then
i
am
going
in
to
see
him
and
miss
anna
oh
come
now
said
alice
or
he
will
be
over
here
phillis
got
up
and
walked
slowly
to
the
house
alice
at
her
side
and
bacchus
stumping
after
her
as
they
went
in
alice
tripped
on
first
and
opened
the
door
making
way
for
phillis
who
looked
with
a
happy
expression
of
face
towards
her
master
is
this
you
phillis
said
weston
coming
forward
and
taking
her
hand
most
kindly
weston
and
ellen
got
up
to
shake
hands
with
her
too
i
am
very
glad
to
find
you
so
much
better
than
i
expected
continued
weston
you
are
thin
but
your
countenance
is
good
i
hope
you
will
get
perfectly
well
now
that
we
are
going
to
have
summer
weather
thank
you
sir
said
phillis
i
am
a
great
deal
better
thank
god
you
all
look
so
well
miss
anna
and
all
miss
janet
began
to
be
mighty
lonesome
i
been
a
great
trouble
to
her
no
you
have
not
said
miss
janet
you
never
were
a
trouble
to
any
one
master
said
bacchus
i
think
the
old
ooman
looks
right
well
she
aint
nigh
so
bad
as
we
all
thought
i
reckon
she
could
stand
my
bein
away
so
long
she
had
nobody
to
trouble
her
you
will
never
give
her
any
more
trouble
said
alice
aunt
phillis
you
do
know
how
steady
uncle
bacchus
has
been
he
is
getting
quite
a
temperance
man
old
nick
got
the
better
of
me
twice
though
said
bacchus
i
did
think
master
of
tryin
to
make
phillis
i
had
drank
nothin
dis
winter
but
she
sure
to
find
me
out
there
somefin
in
her
goes
agin
a
lie
but
that
was
doing
very
well
said
alice
do
you
think
so
aunt
phillis
only
twice
all
through
the
winter
its
an
improvement
honey
said
phillis
but
what
the
use
of
getting
drunk
at
all
when
we
are
thirsty
water
is
better
than
any
thing
else
and
when
we
aint
thirsty
what
the
use
of
drinking
phillis
had
been
sitting
in
an
that
weston
had
placed
for
her
when
she
first
came
in
her
face
was
a
little
flushed
from
pleasure
and
the
glow
might
have
been
mistaken
as
an
indication
of
health
the
emotion
passed
weston
perceived
there
was
a
great
change
in
her
she
was
excessively
emaciated
her
prominent
her
eyes
large
and
bright
the
whiteness
of
her
teeth
struck
them
all
these
symptoms
and
the
difficulty
with
which
she
breathed
were
tokens
of
her
disease
she
became
much
fatigued
and
miss
janet
advised
her
to
go
home
and
lie
down
they
sha
tell
you
of
their
grand
doings
phillis
she
said
for
you
have
been
excited
and
must
keep
quiet
in
the
morning
you
will
be
able
to
listen
to
them
do
tell
any
long
stories
bacchus
she
continued
lawton
wants
her
to
keep
from
any
excitement
at
night
for
fear
she
should
not
sleep
well
after
it
all
you
travelers
had
better
go
to
bed
early
and
wake
up
bright
in
the
morning
alice
went
home
with
phillis
and
came
back
to
welcome
barbour
who
had
just
arrived
the
happy
evening
glided
away
home
was
delightful
to
the
returned
family
bacchus
gave
glowing
descriptions
of
scenes
in
which
he
figured
largely
to
the
servants
and
bacchus
the
younger
devoutly
believed
there
had
not
been
so
distinguished
a
visitor
to
the
metropolis
that
winter
as
his
respected
father
lawton
came
regularly
to
see
phillis
who
frequently
rallied
her
cheerfulness
made
her
appear
stronger
than
she
was
but
when
alice
would
tell
her
how
well
she
looked
and
that
the
sight
of
arthur
would
complete
her
recovery
she
invariably
answered
i
want
to
see
him
mightily
child
but
about
my
gettin
well
there
no
telling
god
only
knows
chapter
xxvi
do
sit
down
my
dear
cousin
said
miss
janet
to
weston
who
was
walking
up
and
down
the
here
in
august
instead
of
being
quiet
and
trying
to
keep
cool
you
are
fussing
about
and
heating
yourself
so
uselessly
i
will
try
said
weston
smiling
and
seating
himself
on
the
sofa
but
you
must
recollect
that
for
three
years
i
have
not
seen
my
only
son
and
that
now
he
is
coming
home
to
stay
i
can
not
realize
it
it
is
too
much
happiness
we
are
so
blessed
cousin
janet
we
have
so
much
of
this
good
i
sometimes
tremble
lest
god
should
intend
me
to
have
my
portion
here
it
is
very
wrong
to
feel
so
said
cousin
janet
even
in
this
world
he
can
give
his
beloved
rest
but
am
i
one
of
the
beloved
asked
weston
thoughtfully
i
trust
so
said
cousin
janet
i
do
not
doubt
it
how
lamentable
would
be
your
situation
and
mine
if
while
so
near
the
grave
we
were
deprived
of
that
hope
which
takes
from
it
all
its
gloom
are
you
talking
of
gloom
said
weston
and
arthur
within
a
few
miles
of
us
it
is
a
poor
compliment
to
him
i
never
saw
so
many
happy
faces
the
servants
have
all
availed
themselves
of
their
holiday
to
dress
they
look
so
respectable
esther
says
they
have
gone
to
the
outer
gate
to
welcome
arthur
first
bacchus
went
an
hour
ago
even
poor
aunt
phillis
has
brightened
up
she
has
on
a
and
apron
white
as
snow
and
looks
quite
comfortable
propped
up
by
two
or
three
pillows
arthur
will
be
sadly
distressed
to
see
phillis
though
he
will
not
realize
her
condition
at
first
the
nearer
her
disease
approaches
its
consummation
the
brighter
she
looks
it
seems
but
yesterday
said
weston
that
phillis
sat
at
her
cabin
door
with
arthur
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
her
own
child
almost
the
same
age
in
the
cradle
near
them
she
has
been
no
faithfully
has
she
done
her
duty
and
now
she
is
going
to
receive
her
reward
i
never
can
forget
the
look
of
sympathy
which
was
in
her
face
when
i
used
to
go
to
her
cabin
to
see
my
motherless
child
she
always
gave
arthur
the
preference
putting
her
own
infant
aside
to
attend
to
his
wants
phillis
is
by
nature
a
conscientious
woman
but
nothing
but
the
grace
of
god
could
have
given
her
the
constant
and
firm
principle
that
has
actuated
her
life
but
this
example
of
christian
excellence
will
soon
be
taken
from
us
her
days
are
numbered
her
days
are
numbered
but
how
blessed
the
eternity
sometimes
i
have
almost
reproached
myself
that
i
have
retained
a
woman
like
phillis
as
a
slave
she
deserves
every
thing
from
me
i
have
always
felt
under
obligations
to
her
you
have
discharged
them
said
weston
phillis
though
a
slave
has
had
a
very
happy
life
she
frequently
says
so
this
is
owing
in
a
great
measure
to
her
own
disposition
and
rectitude
of
character
yet
she
has
had
every
thing
she
needed
and
a
great
deal
more
you
have
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
yourself
i
trust
not
said
weston
i
have
endeavored
in
my
dealings
with
my
servants
to
remember
the
eye
was
upon
me
and
that
to
him
who
placed
these
human
beings
in
a
dependant
position
would
i
have
to
render
my
account
ah
here
are
the
girls
alice
we
had
almost
forgotten
arthur
you
and
ellen
remind
us
of
him
really
said
ellen
i
am
very
unhappy
i
have
no
lover
to
expect
you
see
that
i
am
arrayed
in
a
plain
black
silk
to
show
my
chagrin
because
johnson
could
not
come
now
alice
has
decked
herself
so
that
arthur
can
read
her
every
thought
at
the
first
glance
she
has
on
her
blue
barège
dress
which
implies
her
unvarying
constancy
then
i
did
not
think
of
that
said
alice
blushing
deeply
and
looking
down
at
her
dress
i
only
miss
alice
said
lydia
i
hears
somethin
no
no
said
miss
janet
looking
from
the
window
there
is
nothing
deed
the
is
said
lydia
its
mas
arthur
horse
i
know
weston
went
out
on
the
porch
and
the
ladies
stood
at
the
windows
the
voices
of
the
servants
could
be
distinctly
heard
from
the
nature
of
the
sound
there
was
no
doubt
they
were
giving
a
noisy
welcome
to
their
young
master
he
coming
said
miss
janet
much
agitated
the
servants
would
not
make
that
noise
were
he
not
in
sight
i
hear
the
horses
too
said
ellen
we
will
soon
see
him
where
the
road
turns
there
he
comes
said
weston
it
must
be
arthur
william
is
with
him
he
took
a
horse
for
arthur
to
the
stage
house
the
father
stood
looking
forward
the
wind
gently
lifting
the
thin
white
hair
from
his
temples
his
cheek
flushed
his
clear
blue
eye
beaming
with
delight
the
horseman
approached
the
old
man
could
not
distinguish
his
face
yet
there
was
no
mistaking
his
gay
and
gallant
bearing
the
spirited
and
handsome
animal
that
bore
him
flew
over
the
gravelled
avenue
only
a
few
minutes
elapsed
from
the
time
he
was
first
seen
to
the
moment
when
the
father
laid
his
head
upon
his
son
shoulder
and
while
he
was
clasped
to
that
youthful
and
manly
heart
experienced
sensations
of
joy
such
as
are
not
often
felt
here
alice
had
known
too
that
it
was
he
but
when
we
long
to
be
assured
of
happiness
we
are
often
slow
to
believe
it
was
not
until
her
eyes
could
distinguish
every
feature
that
her
heart
said
it
is
arthur
then
all
was
forgotten
all
timidity
all
reserve
all
save
that
he
was
the
dearly
loved
brother
of
her
childhood
the
being
with
whom
her
destiny
had
long
been
associated
she
passed
from
the
to
the
porch
as
he
alighted
from
his
horse
and
when
his
father
released
him
from
a
long
embrace
arthur
eyes
fell
upon
the
dear
and
unchanged
countenance
fixed
upon
him
with
a
look
of
welcome
that
said
more
than
a
thousand
words
aunt
said
arthur
a
week
after
his
return
as
he
sat
with
weston
and
alice
in
the
arbor
before
you
came
alice
had
been
trying
to
persuade
me
that
she
had
been
in
love
with
walter
but
i
ca
believe
it
i
never
did
believe
it
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
was
and
she
was
seized
with
such
a
panic
of
truth
and
honor
that
she
made
a
great
commotion
insisted
on
writing
to
you
and
making
a
full
confession
wanted
to
tell
her
uncle
and
worry
him
to
death
doing
all
sorts
of
desperate
things
she
actually
worked
herself
into
a
fever
it
was
all
a
fancy
i
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
myself
to
believe
it
said
arthur
i
am
sorry
said
alice
for
it
is
true
it
is
a
pity
your
vanity
can
not
be
a
little
diminished
why
the
fact
is
alice
i
remember
uncle
bacchus
story
about
general
washington
and
his
servant
when
the
general
horse
fell
dead
or
rather
the
exclamation
made
by
the
servant
after
relating
the
incident
thinks
of
everything
i
do
too
when
we
were
children
no
matter
how
bad
walter
was
you
took
his
part
i
remember
once
he
gave
william
such
a
blow
because
he
stumbled
over
a
wagon
that
he
had
been
making
and
broke
it
i
asked
him
if
he
were
not
ashamed
to
do
so
and
you
said
arthur
he
feels
bad
if
you
felt
as
sorry
as
he
does
you
would
behave
just
in
the
same
way
so
the
fact
is
last
summer
you
saw
he
and
your
tender
heart
inundated
with
sympathy
that
was
it
said
weston
it
was
a
complete
inundation
you
are
not
in
love
with
him
now
are
you
alice
said
arthur
smiling
no
indeed
said
alice
i
am
not
in
love
with
him
or
you
either
if
being
in
love
is
what
it
is
described
in
novels
i
never
have
palpitation
of
the
heart
never
faint
away
and
am
not
at
all
fond
of
poetry
i
should
make
a
sad
heroine
i
am
such
a
person
so
as
you
make
a
good
wife
said
arthur
no
matter
about
being
a
heroine
a
planter
wife
has
little
occasion
for
romance
said
weston
her
duties
are
too
many
and
too
important
she
must
care
for
the
health
and
comfort
of
her
family
and
of
her
servants
after
all
a
hundred
servants
are
like
so
many
children
to
look
after
ellen
would
make
an
elegant
heroine
said
alice
she
was
left
an
orphan
when
very
young
had
an
exacting
uncle
and
aunt
was
the
belle
of
the
metropolis
had
gay
and
gallant
lovers
is
an
heiress
and
has
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
she
never
saw
to
crown
all
he
is
not
rich
so
ellen
can
give
him
her
large
fortune
to
show
her
devotion
and
they
can
go
all
over
the
world
together
and
revel
in
romance
and
novelty
well
said
arthur
i
will
take
you
all
over
the
world
if
you
wish
it
when
will
you
set
out
and
how
will
you
travel
if
that
is
all
you
complain
of
in
your
destiny
i
can
easily
change
it
i
do
not
complain
of
my
destiny
said
alice
gaily
i
was
only
contrasting
it
with
ellen
i
shall
be
satisfied
never
to
leave
exeter
and
my
migrations
need
not
be
more
extended
than
were
primroses
the
green
room
to
the
brown
poor
walter
i
wish
he
would
fall
in
love
with
some
beautiful
italian
and
be
as
happy
as
we
are
do
not
fear
for
walter
said
weston
he
will
take
care
of
himself
his
last
letter
to
cousin
janet
was
very
cheerful
i
shall
have
to
diminish
your
vanity
alice
by
telling
you
walter
will
never
for
love
of
alice
weston
he
will
be
captivated
some
day
with
a
more
dashy
lady
if
not
an
italian
countess
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
eventually
become
a
resident
of
europe
a
life
of
repentance
will
not
be
too
much
for
a
man
whose
hands
are
stained
with
the
blood
of
his
fellowman
the
day
is
past
in
our
country
and
i
rejoice
to
say
it
when
a
duellist
can
be
tolerated
i
always
shudder
when
in
the
presence
of
one
though
i
never
saw
but
one
weston
now
entered
much
depressed
from
a
recent
interview
with
phillis
this
faithful
and
honored
servant
was
near
her
departure
angels
were
waiting
at
the
throne
of
the
eternal
for
his
command
to
bear
her
purified
spirit
home
the
master
and
the
slave
were
alone
no
eye
save
their
maker
looked
upon
them
no
ear
save
his
heard
what
passed
between
them
weston
was
seated
in
the
easy
chair
which
had
been
removed
from
the
other
room
and
in
which
his
wife
had
died
phillis
was
extended
on
a
bed
of
death
her
thin
hands
crossed
on
her
bosom
her
eyes
fearfully
bright
a
hectic
glow
upon
her
cheek
master
she
said
you
have
no
occasion
to
feel
uneasy
about
that
i
have
never
had
a
want
i
nor
the
children
there
was
a
time
sir
when
i
was
restless
about
being
a
slave
when
i
went
with
you
and
miss
anna
away
from
home
and
heard
the
people
saying
colored
people
ought
to
be
free
it
made
me
feel
bad
i
thought
then
that
god
did
not
mean
one
of
his
creatures
to
be
a
slave
when
i
came
home
and
considered
about
it
i
would
often
be
put
out
and
discontented
it
was
wicked
i
know
but
i
could
not
help
it
for
a
while
i
saw
my
husband
and
children
doing
well
and
happy
but
i
used
to
say
to
myself
they
are
slaves
and
so
am
i
so
i
went
about
my
work
with
a
heavy
heart
when
my
children
was
born
i
would
think
comfort
is
it
to
give
birth
to
a
child
when
i
know
its
a
slave
i
struggled
hard
though
with
these
feelings
sir
and
god
gave
me
grace
to
get
the
better
of
them
for
i
could
not
read
my
bible
without
seeing
there
was
nothing
agin
slavery
there
and
that
god
had
told
the
master
his
duty
and
the
slave
his
duty
you
done
your
duty
by
me
and
mine
sir
and
i
hope
where
i
have
come
short
you
will
forgive
me
for
i
could
die
in
peace
without
i
thought
you
and
i
was
all
right
together
forgive
you
phillis
said
weston
much
affected
what
have
i
to
forgive
rather
do
i
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
you
were
a
friend
and
nurse
to
my
wife
and
a
mother
to
my
only
child
was
ever
servant
or
friend
so
faithful
as
you
have
been
phillis
smiled
and
looked
very
happy
thank
you
master
she
said
from
my
heart
how
good
the
lord
is
to
me
to
make
my
dying
bed
so
easy
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
hymn
esther
sings
she
got
a
pleasant
voice
she
sir
while
i
feel
my
break
how
sweet
the
moments
roll
a
mortal
paleness
on
my
cheek
and
glory
in
my
soul
oh
master
its
sweet
for
me
to
die
for
jesus
is
my
friend
he
makes
all
about
me
friends
too
for
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
miss
janet
and
all
of
you
are
my
friends
poor
bacchus
he
takes
on
sadly
about
me
he
always
was
a
soul
master
when
i
am
gone
i
know
you
will
be
good
to
him
and
comfort
him
but
please
sir
do
something
else
talk
to
him
and
pray
for
him
and
read
the
blessed
book
to
him
oh
if
he
would
only
give
up
liquor
i
trust
in
the
lord
he
will
live
and
die
a
sober
man
else
i
know
we
never
meet
again
we
wo
be
on
the
same
side
at
the
judgment
seat
there
no
drunkards
in
that
happy
place
where
i
am
going
fast
no
drunkards
in
the
light
of
god
face
no
drunkards
at
the
blessed
feet
of
jesus
i
think
bacchus
has
perfectly
reformed
said
weston
and
you
may
feel
assured
that
we
will
do
every
thing
for
his
soul
as
well
as
his
body
that
we
can
but
phillis
have
you
no
wishes
to
express
as
regards
your
children
phillis
hesitated
my
children
are
well
off
she
said
they
have
a
good
master
if
they
serve
him
and
god
faithfully
they
will
be
sure
to
do
well
if
there
is
any
thing
on
your
mind
said
weston
speak
it
without
fear
the
distinction
between
you
and
me
as
master
and
slave
i
consider
no
longer
existing
you
are
near
being
redeemed
from
my
power
and
the
power
of
death
alone
divides
you
from
your
saviour
presence
that
saviour
whose
example
you
have
tried
to
follow
whose
blood
has
washed
your
soul
from
all
its
sin
i
am
much
older
than
you
and
i
live
in
momentary
expectation
of
my
summons
we
shall
soon
meet
i
hope
in
that
happy
place
where
the
distinctions
of
this
world
will
be
forgotten
i
have
thought
of
you
a
great
deal
lately
and
have
been
anxious
to
relieve
your
mind
of
every
care
it
is
natural
that
a
mother
about
to
leave
such
a
family
as
you
have
should
have
some
wishes
regarding
them
i
have
thought
several
times
continued
weston
of
offering
to
set
your
children
free
at
my
death
and
i
will
do
so
if
you
wish
you
must
be
aware
that
they
could
not
remain
in
virginia
after
they
were
manumitted
in
the
middle
and
northern
states
free
blacks
are
in
a
degraded
condition
there
is
no
sympathy
for
or
with
them
they
have
no
more
rights
than
they
have
as
slaves
with
us
and
they
have
no
one
to
care
for
them
when
they
are
sick
or
in
trouble
you
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
this
in
your
occasional
visits
to
the
north
in
washington
since
the
abolitionists
have
intermeddled
there
the
free
blacks
have
become
intolerable
they
live
from
day
to
day
in
discomfort
and
idleness
i
mean
as
a
general
thing
there
are
of
course
occasional
exceptions
bacchus
is
too
old
to
take
care
of
himself
he
would
not
be
happy
away
from
exeter
consider
what
i
say
to
you
and
i
will
be
guided
by
your
wishes
as
regards
your
children
they
might
go
to
liberia
some
of
them
would
be
willing
no
doubt
i
have
talked
to
william
he
says
he
would
not
go
under
these
circumstances
they
would
be
separated
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
i
would
be
doing
you
or
them
a
favour
by
freeing
them
be
perfectly
candid
and
let
me
know
your
wishes
as
long
as
you
or
master
arthur
and
miss
alice
live
they
would
be
better
off
as
they
are
said
phillis
i
believe
they
would
said
weston
but
life
and
death
can
not
be
too
much
considered
in
connection
with
each
other
i
must
soon
go
i
am
only
lingering
at
the
close
of
a
long
journey
arthur
will
then
have
control
and
will
i
am
certain
make
his
servants
as
happy
as
he
can
my
family
is
very
small
you
are
aware
i
have
no
near
relations
i
have
made
my
will
and
should
arthur
and
alice
die
without
children
i
have
left
all
my
servants
free
your
children
i
have
thus
provided
for
at
my
death
they
are
free
but
i
would
not
feel
justified
in
turning
them
into
the
world
without
some
provision
the
older
children
can
take
care
of
themselves
they
are
useful
and
have
good
principles
i
have
willed
each
one
of
them
to
be
free
at
the
age
of
twenty
years
thus
you
see
most
of
them
will
soon
be
free
while
none
will
have
to
wait
very
long
in
the
mean
time
they
will
be
well
taught
and
cared
for
my
will
is
made
and
all
the
forms
of
law
attended
to
arthur
and
alice
are
very
much
pleased
with
it
your
older
children
know
it
they
are
very
happy
but
they
declare
they
will
never
leave
exeter
as
long
as
there
is
a
weston
upon
it
b
and
now
phillis
are
you
satisfied
i
shall
experience
great
pleasure
in
having
been
able
to
relieve
you
of
any
anxiety
while
you
have
so
much
pain
to
bear
oh
master
said
phillis
what
shall
i
say
to
you
i
have
no
learning
i
am
only
a
poor
ignorant
woman
i
ca
thank
you
master
as
i
ought
my
heart
is
nigh
to
bursting
what
have
i
done
that
the
lord
is
so
good
to
me
he
has
put
it
into
your
heart
to
make
me
so
happy
thank
you
master
and
god
for
ever
bless
you
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
as
weston
arose
to
go
esther
had
come
to
see
if
her
mother
wanted
any
thing
master
said
phillis
wait
one
moment
there
nothing
between
me
and
heaven
now
oh
sir
i
shall
soon
be
redeemed
from
all
sin
and
sorrow
i
think
i
see
the
glory
that
shines
about
the
heavenly
gates
i
have
never
felt
myself
ready
to
go
until
now
but
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
the
lord
make
your
dying
bed
as
easy
as
you
have
mine
weston
endeavored
to
compose
himself
but
was
much
agitated
phillis
he
said
you
have
deserved
more
than
i
could
ever
do
for
you
if
any
thing
should
occur
to
you
that
i
have
not
thought
of
let
me
know
it
shall
if
possible
be
done
would
you
like
again
to
see
caldwell
and
receive
the
communion
no
master
i
thank
you
you
and
miss
janet
and
miss
anna
and
poor
bacchus
took
it
with
me
last
week
and
i
shall
soon
be
where
there
will
be
no
more
need
to
remind
me
of
the
lamb
that
was
slain
for
i
shall
be
with
him
i
shall
see
him
as
he
is
and
master
we
will
all
meet
there
we
will
praise
him
together
esther
was
weeping
and
weston
quite
overcome
left
the
room
esther
child
said
phillis
do
do
so
there
nothing
but
glory
and
peace
there
no
occasion
for
tears
god
will
take
care
of
you
all
here
and
will
i
hope
and
pray
bring
you
to
heaven
at
last
poor
master
to
think
he
is
so
distressed
parting
with
me
i
thought
i
should
have
stood
by
his
dying
bed
the
lord
knows
best
mother
said
esther

you
take
this
medicine
it
is
time

honey

good
i

want
medicine
jesus
is
what
i
want
he
is
all
in
all
reader
have
you
ever
stood
by
the
dying
bed
of
a
slave
it
may
be
not
there
are
those
who
are
often
there
the
angels
of
god
and
one
who
is
above
the
angels
one
who
died
for
all
he
is
here
now
here
where
stand
weeping
friends
here
where
all
is
silence
you
may
almost
hear
the
angel
wings
as
they
wait
to
bear
the
redeemed
spirit
to
its
heavenly
abode
here
where
the
form
is
almost
senseless
the
soul
fluttering
between
earth
and
heaven
here
where
the
spirit
of
god
is
the
scene
master
said
phillis
all
is
peace
jesus
is
here
i
am
going
home

beckoning
me
to
come
blessed
jesus

home
kind
master
weep
not
she
will
bear
even
at
the
throne
of
god
witness
to
thy
faithfulness
through
thee
she
learned
the
way
to
heaven
and
it
may
be
soon
she
will
stand
by
thee
again
though
thou
see
her
not
she
may
be
one
of
those
who
will
guide
thee
to
the
celestial
city
to
the
company
of
the
redeemed
where
will
be
joy
forever
weep
not
but
see
in
what
peace
a
christian
can
die
watch
the
last
gleams
of
thought
which
stream
from
her
dying
eyes
do
you
see
any
thing
like
apprehension
the
world
it
is
true
begins
to
shut
in
the
shadows
of
evening
collect
around
her
senses
a
dark
mist
thickens
and
rests
upon
the
objects
which
have
hitherto
engaged
her
observation
the
countenances
of
her
friends
become
more
and
more
indistinct
the
sweet
expressions
of
love
and
friendship
are
no
longer
intelligible
her
ear
wakes
no
more
at
the
voice
of
her
children
and
the
soothing
accents
of
tender
affection
die
away
unheard
upon
her
decaying
senses
to
her
the
spectacle
of
human
life
is
drawing
to
its
close
and
the
curtain
is
descending
which
shuts
out
this
earth
its
actors
and
its
scenes
she
is
no
longer
interested
in
all
that
is
done
under
the
sun
oh
that
i
could
now
open
to
you
the
recesses
of
her
soul
that
i
could
reveal
to
you
the
light
which
darts
into
the
chambers
of
her
understanding
she
approaches
that
world
which
she
has
so
long
seen
in
faith
the
imagination
now
collects
its
diminished
strength
and
the
eye
of
faith
opens
wide
friends
do
not
stand
thus
fixed
in
sorrow
around
this
bed
of
death
why
are
you
so
still
and
silent
fear
not
to
move
you
can
not
disturb
the
visions
that
enchant
this
holy
spirit
she
heeds
you
not
already
she
sees
the
spirits
of
the
just
advancing
together
to
receive
a
kindred
soul
she
is
going
to
add
another
to
the
myriads
of
the
just
that
are
every
moment
crowding
into
the
portals
of
heaven
she
is
entering
on
a
noble
life
already
she
cries
to
you
from
the
regions
of
bliss
will
you
not
join
her
there
will
you
not
taste
the
sublime
joys
of
faith
there
are
seats
for
you
in
the
assembly
of
the
just
made
perfect
in
the
innumerable
company
of
angels
where
is
jesus
the
mediator
of
the
new
covenant
and
god
the
judge
of
all
concluding
remarks
i
must
be
allowed
to
quote
the
words
of
harriet
stowe
the
writer
has
often
been
or
will
be
inquired
of
by
correspondents
from
different
parts
of
the
country
whether
this
narrative
is
a
true
one
and
to
these
inquiries
she
will
give
one
general
answer
the
separate
incidents
that
compose
the
narrative
are
to
a
very
great
extent
authentic
occurring
many
of
them
either
under
her
own
observation
or
that
of
her
personal
friends
she
or
her
friends
have
observed
characters
the
counterpart
of
almost
all
that
are
here
introduced
and
many
of
the
sayings
are
word
for
word
as
heard
herself
or
reported
to
her
of
the
planter
legree
and
with
the
exception
of
webster
such
a
wretch
never
darkened
humanity
she
says
of
him
her
brother
wrote
he
actually
made
me
feel
of
his
fist
which
was
like
a
blacksmith
hammer
or
a
nodule
of
iron
telling
me
that
it
was
calloused
with
knocking
down
niggers
now
as
a
parallel
to
this
i
will
state
a
fact
communicated
to
me
by
a
clergyman
a
man
of
great
talent
and
goodness
of
character
and
undoubted
veracity
that
a
superintendent
of
irishmen
who
were
engaged
on
a
northern
railroad
told
him
he
did
not
hesitate
to
knock
any
man
down
that
gave
him
the
least
trouble
and
although
the
clergyman
did
not
examine
his
fist
and
pronounce
it
like
a
blacksmith
hammer
yet
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
it
was
calloused
with
knocking
down
irishmen
at
any
rate
i
take
the
license
of
the
writers
of
the
day
and
say
it
was
stowe
goes
on
to
say
that
the
tragical
fate
of
tom
also
has
too
many
times
had
its
parallel
there
are
living
witnesses
all
over
our
land
to
testify
now
it
would
take
the
smallest
portion
of
common
sense
to
know
that
there
is
no
witness
dead
or
living
who
could
testify
to
such
a
fact
save
a
this
whole
history
is
an
absurdity
no
master
would
be
fool
enough
to
sell
the
best
hand
on
his
estate
one
who
directed
and
saved
and
managed
for
him
no
master
would
be
brutish
enough
to
sell
the
man
who
had
nursed
him
and
his
children
who
loved
him
like
a
son
for
urgent
had
he
another
article
of
property
in
the
wide
world
but
shelby
does
so
according
to
stowe
though
he
has
a
great
many
other
servants
besides
houses
and
lands
preposterous
and
such
a
saint
as
uncle
tom
was
too
one
would
have
thought
his
master
with
the
opinion
he
had
of
his
religious
qualifications
would
have
kept
him
until
he
died
and
then
have
sold
him
bone
after
bone
to
the
roman
catholics
why
every
tooth
in
his
head
would
have
brought
its
price
paul
was
nothing
but
a
common
man
compared
with
him
for
paul
had
been
wicked
once
and
even
after
his
miraculous
conversion
he
felt
that
sin
was
still
impelling
him
to
do
what
he
would
not
but
not
so
with
uncle
tom
he
was
the
very
perfection
of
a
saint
well
might
clare
have
proposed
using
him
for
a
family
chaplain
or
suggested
to
himself
the
idea
of
ascending
to
heaven
by
tom
skirts
stowe
should
have
carried
out
one
of
her
ideas
in
his
history
and
have
made
him
bishop
of
carthage
i
have
never
heard
or
read
of
so
perfect
a
character
all
the
saints
and
martyrs
that
ever
came
to
unnatural
deaths
could
not
show
such
an
amount
of
excellence
i
only
wonder
he
managed
to
stay
so
long
in
this
world
of
sin
when
after
fiery
trials
and
persecutions
he
is
finally
purchased
by
a
legree
stowe
speaks
of
the
horrors
of
the
scene
she
says
though
it
ca
be
helped
did
it
ever
occur
to
her
that
northerners
might
go
south
and
buy
a
great
many
of
these
slaves
and
manumit
them
they
do
go
south
and
buy
them
but
they
keep
them
and
work
them
as
slaves
too
a
great
deal
of
this
misery
be
helped
tom
arrives
at
legree
plantation
how
does
he
fare
sleeps
on
a
little
foul
dirty
straw
jammed
in
with
a
lot
of
others
has
every
night
toward
midnight
enough
corn
to
stay
the
stomach
of
one
small
chicken
and
is
thrown
into
a
most
dreadful
state
of
society
men
degraded
and
women
degraded
we
will
pass
over
scenes
that
a
woman
pen
should
never
describe
and
observe
the
perfection
of
tom
he
was
or
considered
himself
a
missionary
to
the
negroes
evidently
liked
his
sufferings
and
died
by
choice
a
martyr
death
he
made
the
most
astonishing
number
of
conversions
in
a
short
time
and
of
characters
worse
than
history
records
so
low
so
degraded
so
lost
were
the
men
and
women
whose
wicked
hearts
he
subdued
that
their
conversion
amounted
to
nothing
less
than
miracles
no
matter
how
low
how
ignorant
how
depraved
the
very
sight
of
tom
turned
them
into
advanced
intelligent
christians
tom
lines
were
indeed
cast
in
a
sad
place
i
have
always
believed
that
the
creator
was
everywhere
but
we
are
told
of
legree
plantation
the
lord
never
visits
these
parts
this
might
account
for
the
desperate
wickedness
of
most
of
the
characters
but
how
tom
could
retain
his
holiness
under
the
circumstances
is
a
marvel
to
me
his
religion
then
depended
on
himself
assuredly
he
was
more
than
a
man
legree
had
several
ways
of
keeping
his
servants
in
order
they
were
burned
alive
scalded
cut
into
inch
pieces
set
up
for
the
dogs
to
tear
or
hung
up
and
whipped
to
death
now
i
am
convinced
that
stowe
must
have
a
credulous
mind
and
was
imposed
upon
she
never
could
have
conceived
such
things
with
all
her
talent
the
very
conception
implies
a
refinement
of
cruelty
she
gives
however
a
mysterious
description
of
a
certain
place
way
out
down
by
the
quarters
where
you
can
see
a
black
blasted
tree
and
the
ground
all
covered
with
black
ashes
it
is
afterward
intimated
that
this
was
the
scene
of
a
negro
burned
alive
reader
you
may
depend
it
was
a
mistake
that
just
the
way
a
tree
appears
when
it
has
been
struck
by
lightning
next
time
you
pass
one
look
at
it
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
this
was
the
way
the
mistake
was
made
we
have
an
occasional
wag
at
the
south
and
some
one
has
practised
upon
a
new
englander
in
search
of
horrors
this
is
the
result
she
mentions
that
the
ashes
were
black
do
not
infer
from
this
that
it
must
have
been
a
black
man
or
negro
but
i
will
no
longer
arraign
your
good
sense
it
was
not
take
my
word
for
it
as
stowe
describes
it
some
poor
negro
tied
to
a
tree
with
a
slow
fire
lit
under
him
tom
tells
legree
he
as
soon
die
as
not
indeed
he
proposes
whipping
starving
burning
saying
it
will
only
send
him
sooner
where
he
wants
to
go
tom
evidently
considers
himself
as
too
good
for
this
world
and
after
making
these
proposals
to
his
master
he
is
asked
how
are
you
he
answers
the
lord
god
has
sent
his
angel
and
shut
the
lion
mouth
anybody
can
see
that
he
is
laboring
under
a
hallucination
and
fancies
himself
daniel
cassy
however
consoled
him
after
the
style
of
friends
by
telling
him
that
his
master
was
going
to
hang
like
a
dog
at
his
throat
sucking
his
blood
bleeding
away
his
life
drop
by
drop
in
what
an
attitude
o
planters
of
the
south
has
stowe
taken
your
likenesses
tom
dies
at
last
how
could
such
a
man
die
oh
that
he
would
live
forever
and
convert
all
our
southern
slaves
he
did
not
need
any
supporting
grace
on
his
deathbed
hear
him
the
lord
may
help
me
or
not
help
but
hold
on
to
him
i
thought
a
christian
could
not
hold
on
to
the
lord
without
help
ye
can
of
yourself
do
nothing
but
tom
is
an
exception
to
the
last
he
is
perfect
all
christians
have
been
caught
tripping
sometimes
but
tom
never
is
he
is
bearing
everybody
burdens
he
might
run
away
but
he
will
not
he
says
the
lord
has
given
me
a
work
among
these
yer
poor
souls
and
i
stay
with
and
bear
my
cross
with
to
the
end
christian
reader
we
must
reflect
we
know
where
to
go
for
instance
of
human
perfection
where
the
human
and
the
divine
were
united
but
we
know
not
of
another
tom
converts
cassy
a
most
infamous
creature
from
her
own
accounts
and
we
are
to
sympathize
with
her
vileness
for
she
has
no
other
traits
of
character
described
tom
converts
her
but
i
am
sorry
to
see
she
steals
money
and
goods
and
fibs
tremendously
afterwards
we
hope
the
rest
of
his
converts
did
him
more
credit
the
poor
fellow
dies
at
last
converting
two
awful
wretches
with
his
expiring
breath
the
process
of
conversion
was
very
short
oh
lord
give
me
these
two
more
souls
i
pray
that
prayer
was
answered
the
saddest
part
of
this
book
would
be
if
they
were
just
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
history
of
this
wretch
legree
stowe
says
he
was
rocked
on
the
bosom
of
a
mother
cradled
with
prayer
and
pious
hymns
his
now
seared
brow
bedewed
with
the
waters
of
baptism
in
early
childhood
a
woman
had
led
him
at
the
sound
of
sabbath
bells
to
worship
and
to
pray
far
in
new
england
that
mother
had
trained
her
only
son
with
long
unwearied
love
and
patient
prayers
believe
it
not
christian
mother
north
or
south
thou
hast
the
promises
of
scripture
to
the
contrary
rock
thy
babe
upon
thy
bosom
sing
to
him
sweet
hymns
carry
him
to
the
baptismal
font
be
unwearied
in
love
patient
in
prayers
he
will
never
be
such
a
one
he
may
wander
but
he
will
come
back
do
thy
duty
by
him
and
god
will
not
forget
his
promises
he
is
not
man
that
he
will
lie
nor
the
son
of
man
that
he
will
repent
legree
is
a
northerner
time
would
fail
me
to
notice
all
the
crimes
with
which
southern
men
and
women
are
charged
but
their
greatness
and
number
precludes
the
possibility
of
their
being
believed
according
to
stowe
mothers
do
not
love
their
beautiful
children
at
the
south
the
husbands
have
to
go
to
new
england
and
bring
back
old
maids
to
take
care
of
them
and
to
see
to
their
houses
which
are
going
to
rack
and
ruin
under
their
wives
surveillance
oh
these
southern
husbands
a
heart
of
stone
must
pity
them
then
again
southern
planters
keep
dogs
and
to
hunt
up
negroes
tear
women
faces
and
commit
all
sorts
of
atrocities
now
i
have
a
charitable
way
of
accounting
for
this
i
am
convinced
too
this
is
a
misapprehension
and
i
tell
you
why
i
have
a
mortal
fear
of
dogs
myself
i
always
had
no
reasoning
no
scolding
ever
had
the
slightest
effect
upon
me
i
never
passed
one
on
my
way
to
church
with
my
in
my
hand
without
quaking
if
they
wag
their
tails
i
look
around
for
aid
if
they
bark
i
immediately
give
myself
up
for
lost
i
have
died
a
thousand
deaths
from
the
mere
accident
of
meeting
dogs
in
the
street
i
never
did
meet
one
without
believing
that
it
was
his
destiny
to
give
my
children
a
in
point
of
fact
i
would
like
to
live
in
a
world
without
dogs
but
as
i
can
not
accomplish
this
i
console
myself
by
living
in
a
house
without
one
i
always
expect
my
visitors
to
leave
their
dogs
at
home
they
may
bring
their
children
but
they
must
not
bring
their
dogs
i
wish
dogs
would
not
even
look
in
my
basement
windows
as
they
pass
i
am
convinced
therefore
that
some
northerner
has
passed
a
plantation
at
the
south
and
seen
dogs
tied
up
naturally
having
a
horror
of
dogs
he
has
let
his
imagination
loose
after
a
great
deal
of
mental
exercise
the
brain
jumps
at
a
conclusion
what
are
these
dogs
kept
here
for
the
answer
is
palpable
to
hunt
niggers
when
they
run
away
reader
imitate
my
charity
it
is
a
rare
virtue
where
white
faces
are
concerned
all
the
rest
of
stowe
horrors
can
be
accounted
for
satisfactorily
it
is
much
better
to
try
and
find
an
excuse
for
one
than
to
be
always
calling
them
and
the
like
i
am
determined
to
be
charitable
but
still
it
is
misrepresentation
for
if
they
took
proper
means
they
would
find
out
the
delusions
under
which
they
labor
abolitionists
do
not
help
their
cause
by
misrepresentation
it
will
do
well
enough
in
a
book
of
romance
to
describe
infants
torn
from
the
arms
of
their
shrieking
mothers
and
sold
for
five
and
ten
dollars
it
tells
well
for
the
mass
of
readers
are
fond
of
horrors
but
it
is
not
true
it
is
on
a
par
with
the
fact
stated
that
masters
advertise
their
slaves
and
offer
rewards
for
them
dead
or
alive
how
did
the
snows
of
new
england
ever
give
birth
to
such
brilliant
imaginations
family
relations
are
generally
respected
and
when
they
are
not
it
is
one
of
the
evils
attendant
on
an
institution
which
god
has
permitted
in
all
ages
for
his
inscrutable
purposes
and
which
he
may
in
his
good
time
do
away
with
the
jews
ever
turn
their
eyes
and
affections
toward
jerusalem
as
their
home
so
should
the
free
colored
people
in
america
regard
liberia
africa
once
their
mother
country
should
in
its
turn
be
the
country
of
their
adoption
as
regards
the
standard
of
talent
among
negroes
i
fancy
it
has
been
exaggerated
though
no
one
can
at
present
form
a
just
conclusion
slavery
has
for
ages
pressed
like
a
band
of
iron
round
the
intellect
of
the
colored
man
time
must
do
its
work
to
show
what
he
is
without
a
like
hindrance
the
instance
mentioned
in
uncle
tom
cabin
of
a
young
mulatto
george
harris
inventing
a
machine
is
the
negroes
like
a
good
many
of
their
owners
are
opposed
to
innovations
they
like
the
good
old
way
the
hot
sun
under
which
they
were
born
and
the
hotter
one
that
lighted
the
paths
of
their
ancestors
prejudices
them
against
any
new
effort
i
think
they
do
get
in
they
will
vote
for
agricultural
against
manufacturing
interests
i
am
sure
they
would
rather
pick
cotton
than
be
confined
to
the
din
and
dust
of
a
factory
an
old
negro
prefers
to
put
his
meal
bags
in
a
covered
wagon
and
drive
them
to
market
at
his
leisure
with
his
pocket
full
of
the
tobacco
he
helped
to
raise
and
the
whole
country
for
a
to
being
whirled
away
bodily
in
a
railroad
car
in
terror
of
his
life
deaf
with
the
whistling
and
the
puffing
of
the
engine
when
liberia
or
africa
does
become
a
great
nation
heaven
grant
it
may
soon
they
will
require
many
other
buildings
there
before
a
patent
office
is
called
for
george
harris
is
a
abolitionist
with
a
dark
complexion
he
is
a
remarkable
youth
in
other
respects
though
i
should
first
consider
the
enormous
fact
of
george
master
appropriating
to
himself
the
benefit
of
his
servant
cleverness
even
with
a
show
of
right
this
may
be
a
mean
trick
but
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
a
large
portion
of
new
england
men
are
at
this
time
claiming
each
other
patents
i
know
of
an
instance
down
east
for
southerners
can
sometimes
tak
notes
and
prent
too
a
gentleman
took
a
friend
to
his
room
and
showed
him
an
invention
for
which
he
was
about
to
apply
for
a
patent
the
friend
walked
off
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
his
principles
had
met
and
passed
an
appropriation
bill
the
invention
had
become
his
own
in
plain
english
he
stole
it
washington
is
always
full
of
people
claiming
each
other
brains
the
lawyers
at
the
patent
office
have
their
hands
full
they
must
keep
wide
awake
too
each
inventor
when
he
relates
his
grievances
brings
a
witness
to
maintain
his
claim
there
is
no
doubt
that
after
a
while
there
will
be
those
who
can
testify
to
the
fact
of
having
seen
the
idea
as
it
passed
through
the
inventor
mind
the
way
it
is
settled
at
present
is
this
whoever
can
pay
the
most
for
the
best
lawyer
comes
off
triumphantly
poor
george
is
not
the
only
smart
fellow
in
the
world
outdone
by
somebody
better
off
than
himself
george
positively
refuses
to
hear
the
bible
quoted
he
believes
in
a
higher
law
no
doubt
frederic
douglas
being
editorial
expounder
a
sort
of
moses
of
this
century
a
little
less
meek
though
than
the
one
who
instructed
the
israelites
george
wo
hear
the
bible
he
prefers
he
says
appealing
to
the
almighty
himself
this
makes
me
fear
his
abolitionist
friends
are
not
doing
right
by
him
putting
him
up
to
shooting
and
turning
spanish
gentleman
and
all
sorts
of
vagaries
to
say
nothing
of
disobeying
the
laws
of
the
country
no
one
blames
him
though
for
escaping
from
a
hard
master
at
least
i
do
not
it
would
be
a
grand
thing
to
stand
on
the
shore
of
a
new
country
and
see
before
you
every
slave
and
prisoner
on
the
soil
of
the
earth
to
hear
their
te
deum
ascend
to
the
listening
heavens
methinks
the
sun
would
stand
still
as
it
did
of
old
and
earth
would
lift
up
her
voice
and
lead
the
song
of
her
ransomed
children
but
alas
this
can
not
be
yet
the
time
is
not
come
oppression
wears
her
crown
in
every
clime
though
it
is
sometimes
hidden
from
the
gaze
of
her
subjects
george
declares
he
knows
more
than
his
master
he
can
read
and
write
better
but
his
logic
is
bad
he
thus
discusses
the
indications
of
providence
a
friend
reminds
him
of
what
the
apostle
says
let
every
man
abide
in
the
condition
in
which
he
is
called
and
he
immediately
uses
this
simile
i
wonder
wilson
if
the
indians
should
come
and
take
you
a
prisoner
away
from
your
wife
and
children
and
want
to
keep
you
all
your
life
hoeing
corn
for
them
if
you
think
it
your
duty
to
abide
in
that
condition
in
which
you
were
called
i
rather
think
that
you
think
the
first
stray
horse
you
could
find
an
indication
of
providence
you
this
does
not
apply
to
slavery
a
man
born
a
slave
in
a
country
where
slavery
is
allowed
by
law
should
feel
the
obligation
of
doing
his
duty
while
a
slave
but
wilson
carried
off
by
indians
would
feel
as
if
he
had
been
called
to
a
state
of
life
previous
to
the
one
in
which
he
was
so
unfortunate
to
be
doomed
while
he
was
among
savages
george
goes
on
to
say
let
any
man
take
care
that
tries
to
stop
me
for
i
am
desperate
and
i
fight
for
my
liberty
you
say
your
fathers
did
it
if
it
was
right
for
them
it
is
right
for
me
too
fast
george
you
are
out
in
your
history
too
your
master
must
be
a
remarkably
ignorant
man
if
you
know
more
than
he
our
glorious
ancestors
were
never
condemned
to
slavery
they
nor
their
fathers
by
god
himself
neither
have
they
ever
been
considered
in
the
light
of
runaways
they
came
off
with
full
permission
and
having
and
attained
their
liberties
they
fought
for
them
besides
being
of
a
prettier
complexion
and
coming
of
a
better
stock
than
you
they
were
to
be
free
there
is
a
great
deal
in
that
then
those
very
ancestors
of
ours
ah
there
the
rub
and
the
ancestors
of
the
abolitionists
too
they
got
us
and
you
into
this
difficulty
think
of
it
they
had
your
ancestors
up
there
in
new
england
until
they
found
you
were
so
lazy
and
died
off
so
in
their
cold
climate
that
it
not
pay
to
keep
so
i
repeat
to
you
the
advice
of
wilson
be
careful
my
boy
do
shoot
anybody
george
unless
well
you
better
not
shoot
i
reckon
at
least
i
would
hit
anybody
you
know
as
regards
the
practice
of
marking
negroes
in
the
hand
i
look
upon
it
as
one
of
the
imaginary
horrors
of
the
times
delusion
like
spiritual
rappings
got
up
out
of
sheer
timidity
of
disposition
though
i
have
heard
of
burning
old
women
for
witches
in
new
england
and
placing
a
scarlet
letter
on
the
bosom
of
some
unhappy
one
who
had
already
sorrow
and
sin
enough
to
bear
it
wo
do
the
subject
has
without
doubt
been
duly
investigated
already
i
be
willing
were
i
not
opposed
to
betting
to
bet
my
best
collar
and
neck
ribbon
that
a
committee
of
investigation
has
been
appointed
consisting
of
twelve
of
boston
primmest
old
maids
and
they
have
been
scouring
the
plantations
of
the
south
bidding
the
negroes
hold
out
their
hands
not
as
the
poor
souls
will
at
first
suppose
that
they
may
be
crossed
with
a
piece
of
silver
and
that
they
are
now
returning
to
their
native
city
not
having
seen
a
branded
hand
in
all
their
journeying
could
aught
escape
vigilance
but
they
will
say
they
saw
a
vast
number
and
that
will
answer
the
purpose
ah
washington
irving
well
mayest
thou
sigh
and
look
back
at
the
ladies
of
the
golden
age
these
were
the
honest
days
in
which
every
woman
stayed
at
home
read
the
bible
and
wore
pockets
these
days
are
for
ever
gone
prophetic
was
thy
lament
now
we
may
wear
pockets
but
alas
we
neither
stay
at
home
nor
read
our
bible
we
form
societies
to
reform
the
world
and
we
write
books
on
slavery
talking
of
our
ancestors
george
in
the
time
of
the
revolution
yours
were
a
set
of
dear
honest
old
creatures
for
there
were
no
abolitionists
then
among
us
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
about
george
washington
and
a
favorite
servant
billy
lee
was
an
honest
faithful
man
and
a
groom
and
george
washington
you
need
not
blush
to
be
a
namesake
of
his
though
he
was
a
slaveholder
the
two
were
in
a
battle
the
battle
of
monmouth
the
soldiers
fighting
like
sixty
and
billy
lee
looking
on
at
a
convenient
distance
taking
charge
of
a
led
horse
in
case
washington
should
be
shot
from
under
him
o
but
it
was
a
hot
day
washington
used
to
recall
the
thirst
and
the
suffering
attendant
upon
the
heat
thinking
of
the
soldiers
suffering
and
not
of
his
own
as
for
billy
lee
if
he
did
not
breathe
freely
he
perspired
enough
so
to
make
up
for
it
i
warrant
you
he
was
anxious
for
the
battle
to
be
over
and
the
sun
to
go
down
but
there
he
stood
true
as
steel
honest
old
patriot
as
he
was
quieting
the
horse
and
watching
his
noble
master
form
as
proud
and
erect
it
was
seen
here
and
there
directing
the
troops
with
that
union
of
energy
and
calmness
for
which
he
was
distinguished
washington
horse
fell
under
him
dying
from
excessive
heat
but
hear
billy
lee
describe
it
lord
sir
if
you
could
a
seen
it
de
heat
and
dust
and
smoke
de
cannons
flyin
and
de
shot
a
whizzin
and
de
dust
a
blowing
and
de
heels
a
kickin
up
when
all
at
onct
master
horse
fell
under
him
it
war
shot
bless
your
soul
no
it
drapped
right
down
dead
wid
de
heat
master
he
got
up
i
was
scared
when
i
see
him
and
de
horse
go
but
master
got
up
he
war
hurt
could
hurt
him
master
he
got
up
looked
round
at
me
says
he
me
the
other
horse
and
you
take
care
of
the
new
saddle
on
this
other
poor
fellow
did
you
ever
hear
de
like
added
billy
lee
thinking
of
de
saddle
when
de
balls
was
a
flyin
most
in
our
eyes
but
it
always
de
same
wid
master
he
thinks
of
every
thing
i
agree
with
the
humane
jurist
quoted
by
harriet
beecher
stowe
the
worst
use
you
can
put
a
man
to
is
to
hang
him
she
thinks
slavery
is
worse
still
but
when
i
think
of
every
thing
i
am
forced
to
differ
from
her
the
most
of
our
southern
slaves
are
happy
and
kindly
cared
for
and
for
those
who
are
not
there
is
hope
for
the
better
but
when
a
man
is
hung
up
by
the
neck
until
he
is
dead
he
is
done
for
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
suggested
to
better
his
condition
i
have
no
wish
to
uphold
slavery
i
would
that
every
human
being
that
god
has
made
were
free
were
it
in
accordance
with
his
will
free
bodily
free
spiritually
free
indeed
neither
do
i
desire
to
deny
the
evils
of
slavery
any
more
than
i
would
deny
the
evils
of
the
factory
system
in
england
or
the
factory
and
apprenticeship
system
in
our
own
country
i
only
assert
the
necessity
of
the
existence
of
slavery
at
present
in
our
southern
states
and
that
as
a
general
thing
the
slaves
are
comfortable
and
contented
and
their
owners
humane
and
kind
i
have
lived
a
great
deal
at
the
north
long
enough
to
see
acts
of
oppression
and
injustice
there
which
were
any
one
so
inclined
might
be
wrought
into
a
living
dramatic
reality
i
knew
a
wealthy
family
all
the
labor
of
the
house
was
performed
by
a
poor
relation
a
young
and
delicate
girl
i
have
known
servants
struck
by
their
employers
at
the
south
i
have
never
seen
a
servant
struck
though
i
know
perfectly
well
such
things
are
done
and
can
we
judge
of
society
by
a
few
isolated
incidents
if
so
the
learned
professors
of
new
england
borrow
money
and
when
they
do
not
choose
to
pay
they
murder
their
creditors
and
cut
them
in
pieces
or
men
kill
their
sleeping
wives
and
children
infidelity
has
been
called
a
magnificent
lie
stowe
living
dramatic
reality
is
nothing
more
than
an
interesting
falsehood
nor
ought
to
be
offered
as
an
equivalent
for
truth
the
genius
that
pervades
her
pages
rather
it
is
to
be
lamented
that
the
rich
gifts
of
god
should
be
so
misapplied
were
the
exertions
of
the
abolitionists
successful
what
would
be
the
result
the
soul
sickens
at
the
thought
scenes
of
blood
and
horror
the
desolation
of
our
fair
southern
states
the
final
destruction
of
the
negroes
in
them
this
would
be
the
result
of
immediate
emancipation
here
what
has
it
been
elsewhere
look
at
domingo
a
recent
visitor
there
says
though
opposed
to
slavery
i
must
acknowledge
that
in
this
instance
the
experiment
has
failed
he
compares
the
negroes
to
a
wretched
gibbering
set
from
their
appearance
and
condition
more
nearly
allied
to
beasts
than
to
men
look
at
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
and
in
canada
i
have
lived
among
them
at
the
north
and
can
judge
for
myself
their
friends
do
not
always
obtain
their
affection
or
gratitude
a
colored
woman
said
to
me
i
would
rather
work
for
any
people
than
the
abolitionists
they
expect
us
to
do
so
much
and
they
say
we
ought
to
work
cheaper
for
them
because
they
are
friends
look
at
them
in
canada
an
english
gentleman
who
has
for
many
years
resided
there
and
who
has
recently
visited
washington
told
me
that
they
were
the
most
miserable
helpless
human
beings
he
had
ever
seen
in
fact
he
said
they
were
nuisances
and
the
people
of
canada
would
be
truly
thankful
to
see
them
out
of
their
country
he
had
never
heard
of
a
good
missionary
mentioned
by
stowe
whom
christian
charity
has
placed
there
as
a
shepherd
to
the
outcast
and
wandering
he
had
seen
no
good
results
of
emancipation
on
one
occasion
he
hired
a
colored
man
to
drive
him
across
the
country
how
did
you
get
here
he
said
to
the
man
are
you
not
a
runaway
yes
sir
the
man
replied
i
came
from
virginny
well
of
course
you
are
a
great
deal
happier
now
than
when
you
were
a
slave
no
sir
if
i
could
get
back
to
virginny
i
would
be
glad
to
go
he
looked
too
as
if
he
had
never
been
worse
off
than
at
that
time
the
fact
is
liberty
like
money
is
a
grand
thing
but
in
order
to
be
happy
we
must
know
how
to
use
it
it
can
not
always
be
said
of
the
fugitive
slave
the
mortal
puts
on
immortality
when
mercy
hand
has
turned
the
golden
key
and
mercy
voice
hath
said
rejoice
thy
soul
is
free
the
attentive
reader
will
perceive
that
i
am
indebted
to
stowe
for
the
application
of
this
and
other
quotations
the
author
of
uncle
tom
cabin
speaks
of
good
men
at
the
north
who
receive
and
educate
the
oppressed
negroes
i
know
lots
of
good
men
there
but
none
good
enough
to
befriend
colored
people
they
seem
to
me
to
have
an
unconquerable
antipathy
to
them
but
stowe
says
educates
them
in
her
own
family
with
her
own
children
i
am
glad
to
hear
she
feels
and
acts
kindly
toward
them
and
i
wish
others
in
her
region
of
country
would
imitate
her
in
this
respect
but
i
would
rather
children
and
negroes
were
educated
at
different
schools
being
utterly
opposed
to
amalgamation
root
and
branch
she
asks
the
question
can
any
individual
do
strange
that
any
one
should
be
at
a
loss
in
this
working
world
of
ours
christian
men
and
women
should
find
enough
to
occupy
them
in
their
families
and
in
an
undoubted
sphere
of
duty
let
the
people
of
the
north
take
care
of
their
own
poor
let
the
people
of
the
south
take
care
of
theirs
let
each
remember
the
great
and
awful
day
when
they
must
render

final
account

of

all
that

in

the
importance
of
this
work
mast
be
obvious
and
being
altogether
without
reference
to
doctrines
or
other
points
in
which
christians
differ
it
is
hoped
it
will
meet
with
favour
from
all
who
love
the
sacred
volume
and
that
it
will
be
sufficiently
interesting
and
attractive
to
recommend
itself
not
only
to
professed
christians
of
denominations
but
also
to
the
general
reader
the
arrangement
of
the
texts
illustrated
with
the
notes
in
the
order
of
the
chapters
and
verses
of
the
authorized
version
of

will
render
it
convenient
for

to
particular
passages

at

will
at
once
enable
the
reader
to
turn

every
subject
discussed

in

it
is
believed
will
form
no
small
part
of
its
attractions
no
pains
have
been
spared
to
procure
such
as
should
embellish
the

and
at
the

time
illustrate
the

objections
that
have
been
made
to
the
pictures
commonly
introduced
into
the
bible
as
being
mere
creations
of
fancy
and
the
imagination
often
unlike
nature
and
frequently
conveying
false
impressions
can
not
be
urged
against
the
pictorial
illustrations
of
this
volume
here
the
fine
arts
are
made
subservient
to
utility
the
landscape
views
being
without
an
exception
views
of
places
mentioned
in
scripture
as
they
appear
at
the
present
thus
in
many
instances
exhibiting
in
the
most
forcible
manner
the
the
strict
and
fulfilment
of
the
remarkable
prophecies
the
present
ruined
and
desolate
condition
of
the
cities
of
babylon
nineveh
selah
and
the
countries
of
edom
and

are
astonishing
examples
and
so
completely
exemplify
in
the
most
minute
particulars
every
thing
which
was
foretold
of
them
in
the
height
of
their
prosperity
that
no
better
description
can
now
be
given
of
them
than
a
simple
quotation
from
a
chapter
and
verse
of
the
bible

nearly
two
or
three
thousand
years
ago

god

armed
with

doing
fierce

as
the
presumption
is
that
the

often

we

these

have
gone
through

they
have
also
been
the

means
not

of

also
of
introducing
the

into

even
into

before

this

fully

this

among

there
are
a
number
that

preface
by

as
no

it
will
argue
bad
taste
in
a

to
be
without
a

the

of
one
who
was
an
honour
to

to
humanity
and
whose
productions
from
first

contain
no
syllable
calculated
to
call
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
modesty
and
virtue
there
is
moreover
in

a
moral
purity
and
a
religious
feeling
which
commend
it
in

there
breathes
throughout
the

a
most
eminent
exemption
from
impropriety
of
thought

and
there
is
at
times
a
pensiveness
of
tone
a
winning
sadness
in
her

serious

which
tells
of

which
has

we
should
judge
its

had
surely
been
to
a
great
feast
of

and
stole
all
the
scraps
a
work
of
this
character
should
have
an
extensive

as
it
entirely
obviates
a
serious
difficulty
in
which
most
readers
are
involved
by
the
frequent
occurrence
of
latin
greek
and
french
passages
which
we
suppose
are
introduced
by
authors
for
a
mere
show
of
learning
a
difficulty
very
perplexing
to
readers
in
general
this
dictionary
of
quotations
concerning
which
too
much
can
not
be
said
in
its
favour
effectually
removes
the
difficulty
and
gives
the
reader
an
advantage
over
the
author
for
we
believe
a
majority
are
themselves
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
the
terms
they
employ
very
few
truly
learned
authors
will
insult
their
readers
by
introducing
latin
or
french
quotations
in
their
writings
when
plain
english
will
do
as
well
but
we
will
not
enlarge
on
this
point
if
the
book
is
useful
to
those
unacquainted
with
other
languages
it
is
no
less
valuable
to
the
classically
educated
as
a
book
of
reference
and
answers
all
the
purposes
of
a
lexicon
indeed
on
many
accounts
it
is
better
it
saves
the
trouble
of
tumbling
over
the
larger

to
which
every
one
and
especially
those
engaged
in
the
