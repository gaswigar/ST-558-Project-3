introduction
the
present
volume
is
the
result
of
the
revision
and
expansion
of
two
essays
entitled
bugs
and
beasts
before
the
law
and
modern
and
mediæval
punishment
which
appeared
in
atlantic
in
august
and
september
since
that
date
the
author
has
collected
a
vast
amount
of
additional
material
on
the
subject
which
has
also
been
discussed
by
other
writers
in
several
publications
the
most
noteworthy
of
which
are
professor
karl
von
amira
s
und
innsbruck
carlo
d
addosio
s
napoli
and
tobler
s
in
der
bern
but
in
none
of
these
works
except
the
are
there
any
important
statements
of
facts
or
citations
of
cases
in
addition
to
those
adduced
in
the
essays
already
mentioned
for
which
the
writer
was
indebted
chiefly
to
the
extensive
and
exceedingly
valuable
researches
of
and
ménebréa
and
the
of
bartholomew
chassenée
cited
in
the
appended
bibliography
professor
von
amira
is
a
very
distinguished
and
remarkably
jurisprudent
and
treats
the
matter
exclusively
from
a
jurisprudential
point
of
view
his
main
object
being
to
discover
some
general
principle
on
which
to
explain
these
strange
phenomena
and
thus
to
assign
to
them
their
proper
place
and
true
significance
in
the
historical
evolution
of
the
idea
of
justice
and
the
methods
of
attaining
it
by
legal
procedure
von
amira
draws
a
sharp
line
of
technical
distinction
between
thierstrafen
and
thierprocesse
the
former
were
capital
punishments
inflicted
by
secular
tribunals
upon
pigs
cows
horses
and
other
domestic
animals
as
a
penalty
for
homicide
the
latter
were
judicial
proceedings
instituted
by
ecclesiastical
courts
against
rats
mice
locusts
weevils
and
other
vermin
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
devouring
the
crops
and
to
expel
them
from
orchards
vineyards
and
cultivated
fields
by
means
of
exorcism
and
excommunication
animals
which
were
in
the
service
of
man
could
be
arrested
tried
convicted
and
executed
like
any
other
members
of
his
household
it
was
therefore
not
necessary
to
summon
them
to
appear
in
court
at
a
specified
time
to
answer
for
their
conduct
and
thus
make
them
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
a
party
to
the
prosecution
for
the
sheriff
had
already
taken
them
in
charge
and
consigned
them
to
the
custody
of
the
jailer
insects
and
rodents
on
the
other
hand
which
were
not
subject
to
human
control
and
could
not
be
seized
and
imprisoned
by
the
civil
authorities
demanded
the
intervention
of
the
church
and
the
exercise
of
its
supernatural
functions
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
them
to
desist
from
their
devastations
and
to
retire
from
all
places
devoted
to
the
production
of
human
sustenance
the
only
feasible
method
of
staying
the
ravages
of
these
swarms
of
noxious
creatures
was
to
resort
to
metaphysical
aid
and
to
expel
or
exterminate
them
by
sacerdotal
conjuring
and
cursing
the
fact
that
it
was
customary
to
catch
several
specimens
of
the
culprits
and
bring
them
before
the
seat
of
justice
and
there
solemnly
put
them
to
death
while
the
anathema
was
being
pronounced
proves
that
this
summary
manner
of
dealing
would
have
been
applied
to
the
whole
of
them
had
it
been
possible
to
do
so
indeed
the
attempt
was
sometimes
made
to
get
rid
of
them
by
setting
a
price
on
their
heads
as
was
the
case
with
the
plague
of
locusts
at
rome
in
when
a
reward
was
offered
for
their
extermination
but
all
efforts
in
this
direction
proving
futile
on
account
of
the
rapidity
with
which
they
propagated
recourse
was
had
to
exorcisms
and
with
holy
water
d
addosio
speaks
of
the
actions
brought
against
domestic
animals
for
homicide
as
penal
prosecutions
and
those
instituted
against
insects
and
vermin
for
injury
done
to
the
fruits
of
the
field
as
civil
suits
but
the
latter
designation
is
not
correct
in
any
proper
sense
of
the
term
since
these
actions
were
not
suits
to
recover
for
damages
to
property
but
had
solely
a
preventive
or
prohibitive
character
the
judicial
process
was
preliminary
to
the
utterance
of
the
malediction
and
essential
to
its
efficacy
before
fulminating
an
excommunication
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
was
put
in
motion
in
order
to
establish
the
guilt
of
the
accused
who
were
then
warned
admonished
and
threatened
and
in
cases
of
obduracy
smitten
with
the
and
devoted
to
utter
destruction
as
with
all
bans
charms
exorcisms
incantations
and
other
magical
the
omission
of
any
formality
would
vitiate
the
whole
procedure
and
by
breaking
the
spell
deprive
the
imprecation
or
interdiction
of
its
occult
virtue
ecclesiastical
thunder
would
thus
be
robbed
of
its
fatal
bolt
and
reduced
to
mere
empty
noise
the
harmless
explosion
of
a
blank
cartridge
the
church
was
not
wholly
consistent
in
its
explanations
of
these
phenomena
in
general
the
swarms
of
devouring
insects
and
other
noxious
vermin
are
assumed
to
have
been
sent
at
the
instigation
of
satan
sathana
per
maleficium
and
are
denounced
and
deprecated
as
snares
of
the
devil
and
his
satellites
et
ministrorum
again
they
are
treated
as
creatures
of
god
and
agents
of
the
almighty
for
the
punishment
of
sinful
man
from
this
latter
point
of
view
every
effort
to
exterminate
them
by
natural
means
would
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
sacrilege
an
impious
attempt
to
war
upon
the
supreme
being
and
to
withstand
his
designs
in
either
case
whether
they
were
the
emissaries
of
a
wicked
demon
or
of
a
wrathful
deity
the
only
proper
and
permissible
way
of
relief
was
through
the
offices
of
the
church
whose
bishops
and
other
clergy
were
empowered
to
perform
the
adjurations
and
maledictions
or
to
prescribe
the
penances
and
propitiations
necessary
to
produce
this
result
if
the
insects
were
instruments
of
the
devil
they
might
be
driven
into
the
sea
or
banished
to
some
arid
region
where
they
would
all
miserably
perish
if
on
the
other
hand
they
were
recognized
as
the
ministers
of
god
divinely
delegated
to
scourge
mankind
for
the
promotion
of
piety
it
would
be
suitable
after
they
had
fulfilled
their
mission
to
cause
them
to
withdraw
from
the
cultivated
fields
and
to
assign
them
a
spot
where
they
might
live
in
comfort
without
injury
to
the
inhabitants
the
records
contain
instances
of
both
kinds
of
treatment
it
was
also
as
a
protection
against
evil
spirits
that
the
penalty
of
death
was
inflicted
upon
domestic
animals
a
homicidal
pig
or
bull
was
not
necessarily
assumed
to
be
the
incarnation
of
a
demon
although
it
was
maintained
by
eminent
authorities
as
we
have
shown
in
the
present
work
that
all
beasts
and
birds
as
well
as
creeping
things
were
devils
in
disguise
but
the
homicide
if
it
were
permitted
to
go
unpunished
was
supposed
to
furnish
occasion
for
the
intervention
of
devils
who
were
thereby
enabled
to
take
possession
of
both
persons
and
places
this
belief
was
prevalent
in
the
middle
ages
and
is
still
taught
by
the
catholic
church
in
a
little
volume
entitled
verwaltung
des
exorcistats
nach
massgabe
der
römischen
of
which
a
revised
and
enlarged
edition
was
published
at
stuttgart
in
for
the
use
of
priests
as
a
manual
of
instruction
in
performing
exorcisms
it
is
expressly
stated
by
the
reverend
author
theobald
bischofberger
that
a
spot
where
a
murder
or
other
heinous
crime
has
been
committed
if
the
said
crime
remains
undetected
or
unexpiated
is
sure
to
be
infested
by
demons
and
that
the
inmates
of
a
house
or
other
building
erected
upon
such
a
site
will
be
peculiarly
liable
to
diabolical
possession
however
innocent
they
may
be
personally
indeed
the
more
pure
and
pious
they
are
the
greater
will
be
the
efforts
of
the
demons
to
enter
into
and
annoy
them
not
only
human
beings
but
also
all
cattle
after
their
kind
and
even
the
fowls
of
the
barnyard
are
subject
to
infernal
vexations
of
this
sort
the
infestation
thus
produced
may
continue
for
centuries
and
although
the
property
may
pass
by
purchase
or
inheritance
into
other
hands
and
be
held
successively
by
any
number
of
rightful
owners
the
demons
remain
in
possession
unaffected
by
legal
conveyances
if
each
proprietor
imagines
he
has
an
exclusive
title
to
the
estate
he
reckons
without
the
host
of
devils
who
exercise
there
the
right
of
squatter
sovereignty
and
can
be
expelled
only
by
sacerdotal
authority
bischofberger
goes
so
far
as
to
affirm
that
it
behoves
the
purchaser
of
a
piece
of
land
to
make
sure
that
it
is
unencumbered
by
devils
as
well
as
by
debts
otherwise
he
may
have
to
suffer
more
from
a
demoniac
lien
than
from
a
dead
pledge
or
any
other
form
of
obligation
in
law
information
concerning
the
latter
can
be
obtained
at
the
registry
of
deeds
but
it
is
far
more
difficult
to
ascertain
whether
the
infernal
powers
have
any
claims
upon
it
since
this
knowledge
can
be
derived
only
inferentially
and
indirectly
from
inquiries
into
the
character
of
the
proprietors
for
many
generations
and
must
always
rest
upon
presumptive
evidence
rather
than
positive
proof
our
author
does
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
houses
which
have
been
the
abodes
of
pious
people
from
time
immemorial
ought
to
have
a
higher
market
value
than
the
habitations
of
notoriously
wicked
families
it
is
thus
shown
that
godliness
is
profitable
not
only
unto
all
things
but
also
as
mediæval
writers
were
wont
to
say
unto
some
things
besides
which
the
apostle
paul
in
his
admonitions
to
his
son
timothy
never
dreamed
of
we
are
also
told
that
the
resulting
from
diabolical
infestation
imparts
to
the
dwelling
a
peculiar
taint
which
it
often
retains
for
a
long
time
after
the
demons
have
been
cast
out
so
that
sensitive
persons
can
not
enter
such
a
domicile
without
getting
nervously
excited
slightly
dizzy
and
all
in
a
tremble
the
carnal
mind
which
is
at
enmity
with
all
supernatural
explanations
of
natural
phenomena
would
seek
the
source
of
such
sensations
in
an
arising
from
the
lack
of
proper
ventilation
and
find
relief
by
simply
opening
the
windows
instead
of
calling
in
a
priest
with
aspergills
and
censers
and
we
have
a
striking
illustration
of
this
truth
in
the
frequent
cases
of
bewitched
european
peasants
often
confine
their
cattle
in
stalls
so
small
and
low
that
the
beasts
have
not
sufficient
air
to
breathe
the
result
is
that
a
short
time
after
the
stalls
are
closed
for
the
night
the
cattle
get
excited
and
begin
to
fret
and
fume
and
stamp
and
are
found
in
the
morning
weak
and
exhausted
and
covered
with
sweat
the
peasant
attributes
these
phenomena
to
witchcraft
and
calls
in
an
exorcist
who
proceeds
to
expel
the
evil
spirits
before
performing
the
ceremony
of
conjuration
he
opens
the
doors
and
windows
and
the
admission
of
fresh
air
makes
it
quite
easy
to
cast
out
the
demons
a
german
veterinarian
who
reports
several
instances
of
this
kind
tried
in
vain
to
convince
the
peasants
that
the
trouble
was
due
not
to
sorcery
but
to
the
absence
of
proper
sanatory
conditions
and
finally
in
despair
of
accomplishing
his
purpose
in
any
other
way
told
them
that
if
the
windows
were
left
open
so
that
the
witches
could
go
in
and
out
freely
the
demons
would
not
enter
into
the
cattle
this
advice
was
followed
and
the
malign
influence
ceased
the
ancient
greeks
held
that
a
murder
whether
committed
by
a
man
a
beast
or
an
inanimate
object
unless
properly
expiated
would
arouse
the
furies
and
bring
pestilence
upon
the
land
the
mediæval
church
taught
the
same
doctrine
and
only
substituted
the
demons
of
christian
theology
for
the
furies
of
classical
mythology
as
early
as
the
council
of
worms
decreed
that
bees
which
had
caused
the
death
of
a
human
being
by
stinging
him
should
be
forthwith
suffocated
in
the
hive
before
they
could
make
any
more
honey
otherwise
the
entire
contents
of
the
hive
would
become
demoniacally
tainted
and
thus
rendered
unfit
for
use
as
food
it
was
declared
to
be
unclean
and
this
declaration
of
impurity
implied
a
liability
to
diabolical
possession
on
the
part
of
those
who
like
achan
transgressed
in
the
thing
it
was
the
same
horror
of
aiding
and
abetting
demons
and
enabling
them
to
extend
their
power
over
mankind
that
caused
a
cock
which
was
suspected
of
having
laid
the
or
a
hen
addicted
to
the
ominous
habit
of
crowing
to
be
summarily
put
to
death
since
it
was
only
by
such
expiation
that
the
evil
could
be
averted
a
swiss
jurist
eduard
osenbrüggen
zur
deutschen
und
schweizerischen
schaffhausen
endeavours
to
explain
these
judicial
proceedings
on
the
theory
of
the
personification
of
animals
as
only
a
human
being
can
commit
crime
and
thus
render
himself
liable
to
punishment
he
concludes
that
it
is
only
by
an
act
of
personification
that
the
brute
can
be
placed
in
the
same
category
as
man
and
become
subject
to
the
same
penalties
in
support
of
this
view
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
in
ancient
and
mediæval
times
domestic
animals
were
regarded
as
members
of
the
household
and
entitled
to
the
same
legal
protection
as
human
vassals
in
the
frankish
capitularies
all
beasts
of
burden
or
juments
were
included
in
the
king
s
ban
and
enjoyed
the
peace
guaranteed
by
royal
authority

the

extended
to
them
as
it
did
to
women
and
serfs
under
cover
of
the
man
as
master
of
the
house
and
lord
of
the
manor
the
beste
covert
to
use
the
old
legal
phraseology
was
thus
invested
with
human
rights
and
inferentially
endowed
with
human
responsibilities
according
to
old
welsh
law
atonement
was
made
for
killing
a
cat
or
dog
belonging
to
another
person
by
suspending
the
animal
by
the
tail
so
that
its
nozzle
touched
the
ground
and
then
pouring
wheat
over
it
until
its
body
was
entirely
covered
old
germanic
law
also
recognized
the
competency
of
these
animals
as
witnesses
in
certain
cases
as
for
example
when
burglary
had
been
committed
by
night
in
the
absence
of
human
testimony
the
householder
was
permitted
to
appear
before
the
court
and
make
complaint
carrying
on
his
arm
a
dog
cat
or
cock
and
holding
in
his
hand
three
straws
taken
from
the
roof
as
symbols
of
the
house
symbolism
and
personification
as
applied
to
animals
and
inanimate
objects
unquestionably
played
an
important
part
in
primitive
legislation
but
this
principle
does
not
account
for
the
excommunication
and
anathematization
of
noxious
vermin
or
for
the
criminal
prosecution
and
capital
punishment
of
homicidal
beasts
nor
does
it
throw
the
faintest
light
upon
the
origin
and
purpose
of
such
proceedings
osenbrüggen
s
statement
that
the
cock
condemned
to
be
burned
at
bâle
was
personified
as
a
heretic
ketzer
and
therefore
sentenced
to
the
stake
is
a
and
wholly
fanciful
explanation
as
we
have
already
seen
the
unfortunate
fowl
suspected
of
laying
an
egg
in
violation
of
its
nature
was
feared
as
an
abnormal
inauspicious
and
therefore
diabolic
creature
the
fatal
cockatrice
which
was
supposed
to
issue
from
this
egg
when
hatched
and
the
use
which
might
be
made
of
its
contents
for
promoting
intercourse
with
evil
spirits
caused
such
a
cock
to
be
dreaded
as
a
dangerous
purveyor
to
his
satanic
majesty
but
no
member
of
the
kohlenberg
court
ever
thought
of
consigning
chanticleer
to
the
flames
as
the
peer
of
wycliffe
or
of
huss
in
heresy
the
judicial
prosecution
of
animals
resulting
in
their
excommunication
by
the
church
or
their
execution
by
the
hangman
had
its
origin
in
the
common
superstition
of
the
age
which
has
left
such
a
tragical
record
of
itself
in
the
incredibly
absurd
and
atrocious
annals
of
witchcraft
the
same
ancient
code
that
condemned
a
homicidal
ox
to
be
stoned
declared
that
a
witch
should
not
be
suffered
to
live
and
although
the
jewish
lawgiver
may
have
regarded
the
former
enactment
chiefly
as
a
police
regulation
designed
to
protect
persons
against
unruly
cattle
it
was
like
the
decree
of
death
against
witches
genetically
connected
with
the
hebrew
cult
and
had
therefore
an
essentially
religious
character
it
was
these
two
paragraphs
of
the
mosaic
law
that
christian
tribunals
in
the
middle
ages
were
wont
to
adduce
as
their
authority
for
prosecuting
and
punishing
both
classes
of
delinquents
although
in
the
application
of
them
they
were
undoubtedly
incited
by
motives
and
influenced
by
fears
wholly
foreign
to
the
mind
of
the
levitical
legislator
the
extension
of
christianity
beyond
the
boundaries
of
judaism
and
the
conversion
of
gentile
nations
led
to
its
gradual
but
radical
transformation
the
propagation
of
the
new
and
aggressive
faith
among
the
greeks
and
romans
and
especially
among
the
tribes
of
northern
europe
necessarily
deposed
degraded
and
demonized
the
ancestral
deities
of
the
proselytes
who
were
taught
henceforth
to
abjure
the
gods
of
their
fathers
and
to
denounce
them
as
devils
thus
missionary
zeal
and
success
while
saving
human
souls
from
endless
perdition
served
also
to
enlarge
the
realm
of
the
prince
of
darkness
and
to
increase
the
number
of
his
subjects
and
satellites
the
new
convert
saw
them
with
his
mind
s
eye
skulking
about
in
obscure
places
haunting
forest
dells
and
mountain
streams
by
day
approaching
human
habitations
by
night
and
waiting
for
opportunities
to
lure
him
back
to
the
old
worship
or
to
take
vengeance
upon
him
for
his
recreancy
every
untoward
event
furnished
an
occasion
for
their
intervention
which
could
be
averted
or
repelled
only
by
the
benedictions
exorcisms
or
anathemas
of
the
church
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
were
therefore
directly
interested
in
encouraging
this
superstitious
belief
as
one
of
the
chief
sources
of
their
power
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
diabolical
agencies
were
assumed
to
be
at
work
in
every
maleficent
force
of
nature
and
to
be
incarnate
in
every
noxious
creature
that
this
doctrine
is
still
held
and
this
policy
still
pursued
by
the
bishops
and
other
clergy
of
the
roman
catholic
church
no
one
familiar
with

of

a
curious
fact
that
the
most
recent
and
most
radical
theories
of
juridical
punishment
based
upon
anthropological
sociological
and
psychiatrical
investigations
would
seem
to
obscure

even
to
obliterate
the
line
of
distinction
between
man
and
beast
so
far
as
their
capacity
for
committing
crime
and
their
moral
responsibility
for

misdeeds
are
concerned

wantonly

others
of
their

violating
with
perversity
and
premeditation
the
laws
of
the
society
in

they

thus
the
modern
criminologist
recognizes
the
existence
of
the
kind
of
malefactor
characterized
by
jocodus
damhouder
a
belgian
jurist
of
the
sixteenth
century
as

although
he
might
admit
that
the
beast
perpetrated
the

with
malice
aforethought
and
with
the
clear
consciousness

he
would
never
think
of
bringing
such
a
creature
to
trial
or
of
applying
to
it
the
principle
of
retributive
justice
this
example
illustrates
the
radical
change
which
the
theory
of
punishment
has
undergone
in
recent
times
and
the
influence
which
it
is
beginning
to
exert
upon
penal
legislation
in
the
second
part
of

writer
calls
attention
to
this
important
revolution
in
the
province
of
criminology
discussing
as
concisely
as
possible
its
essential
features
and
indicating
its
general
scope
and
practical
tendencies
so
far
as
they
have
been
determined
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
although
the
savage
spirit
of

that
eagerly
demands
blood
for
blood
without
the
slightest
consideration
of
the
anatomical
physiological
or
psychological
conditions
upon

commission
of
the
specific
act
depends
has
ceased
to
be
the
controlling
factor
in
the
enactment
and
execution
of
penal
codes
the
new
system
of
jurisprudence
based
upon
more
enlightened
conceptions
of
human
responsibility
is
still
in
an
inchoate
state
and
very
far
from
having
worked
out
a

intricate
problem
of

before
the
law
it
is
said
that
bartholomew
chassenée
a
distinguished
french
jurist
of
the
sixteenth
century
born
at
evêque
in
made
his
reputation
at
the
bar
as
counsel
for
some
rats
which
had
been
put
on
trial
before
the
ecclesiastical
court
of
autun
on
the
charge
of
having
feloniously
eaten
up
and
wantonly
destroyed
the
of
that
province
on
complaint
formally
presented
by
the
magistracy
the
official
or
bishop
s
vicar
who
exercised
jurisdiction
in
such
cases
cited
the
culprits
to
appear
on
a
certain
day
and
appointed
chassenée
to
defend
them
in
view
of
the
bad
repute
and
notorious
guilt
of
his
clients
chassenée
was
forced
to
employ
all
sorts
of
legal
shifts
and
chicane
dilatory
pleas
and
other
technical
objections
hoping
thereby
to
find
some
loophole
in
the
meshes
of
the
law
through
which
the
accused
might
escape
or
at
least
to
defer
and
mitigate
the
sentence
of
the
judge
he
urged
in
the
first
place
that
inasmuch
as
the
defendants
were
dispersed
over
a
large
tract
of
country
and
dwelt
in
numerous
villages
a
single
summons
was
insufficient
to
notify
them
all
he
succeeded
therefore
in
obtaining
a
second
citation
to
be
published
from
the
pulpits
of
all
the
parishes
inhabited
by
the
said
rats
at
the
expiration
of
the
considerable
time
which
elapsed
before
this
order
could
be
carried
into
effect
and
the
proclamation
be
duly
made
he
excused
the
default
or
of
his
clients
on
the
ground
of
the
length
and
difficulty
of
the
journey
and
the
serious
perils
which
attended
it
owing
to
the
unwearied
vigilance
of
their
mortal
enemies
the
cats
who
watched
all
their
movements
and
with
fell
intent
lay
in
wait
for
them
at
every
corner
and
passage
on
this
point
chassenée
addressed
the
court
at
some
length
in
order
to
show
that
if
a
person
be
cited
to
appear
at
a
place
to
which
he
can
not
come
with
safety
he
may
exercise
the
right
of
appeal
and
refuse
to
obey
the
writ
even
though
such
appeal
be
expressly
precluded
in
the
summons
the
point
was
argued
as
seriously
as
though
it
were
a
question
of
family
feud
between
capulet
and
montague
in
verona
or
colonna
and
orsini
in
rome
at
a
later
period
of
his
life
chassenée
was
reminded
of
the
legal
principle
thus
laid
down
and
urged
to
apply
it
in
favour
of
clients
more
worthy
of
its
protection
than
a
horde
of
vagrant
rodents
in
he
was
president
of
the
judicial
assembly
known
as
the
parliament
of
provence
on
a
memorable
occasion
when
the
iniquitous
measure
for
the
extirpation
of
heresy
by
exterminating
the
waldenses
in
the
villages
of
cabrières
and
merindol
was
under
discussion
one
of
the
members
of
the
tribunal
a
gentleman
from
arles
renaud
d
alleins
ventured
to
suggest
to
the
presiding
officer
that
it
would
be
extremely
unjust
to
condemn
these
unfortunate
heretics
without
granting
them
a
hearing
and
permitting
an
advocate
to
speak
in
their
defence
so
that
they
might
be
surrounded
by
all
the
safeguards
of
justice
adding
that
the
eminent
jurist
had
formerly
insisted
upon
this
right
before
the
court
of
autun
and
maintained
that
even
animals
should
not
be
adjudged
and
sentenced
without
having
a
proper
person
appointed
to
plead
their
cause
chassenée
thereupon
obtained
a
decree
from
the
king
commanding
that
the
accused
waldenses
should
be
heard
but
his
death
which
occurred
very
soon
afterwards
changed
the
state
of
affairs
and
prevented
whatever
good
effects
might
have
been
produced
by
this
simple
act

justice

this
curious
dissertation
originated
as
it
appears
in
an
application
of
the
inhabitants
of
beaune
to
the
ecclesiastical
tribunal
of
autun
for
a
decree
of
excommunication
against
certain
noxious
insects
called
huberes
or
hurebers
probably
a
kind
of
locust
or
the
request
was
granted
and
the
pernicious
creatures
were
duly
accursed
chassenée
now
raises
the
query
whether
such
a
thing
may
be
rightfully
and
lawfully
done
an
recte
et
de
jure
fieri
and
how
it
should
be
effected
the
principal
question
he
says
is
whether
one
can
by
injunction
cause
such
insects
to
withdraw
from
a
place
in
which
they
are
doing
damage
or
to
abstain
from
doing
damage
there
under
penalty
of
anathema
and
perpetual
malediction
and
although
in
times
past
there
has
never
been
any
doubt
on
this
point
yet
i
have
thought
that
the
subject
should
be
thoroughly
examined
anew
lest
i
should
seem
to
fall
into
the
vice
censured
by
cicero
i
of
regarding
things
which
we
do
not
know
as
if
they
were
well
understood
by
us
and
therefore
rashly
giving
them
our
he
divides
his
treatise
into
five
parts
or
rather
discusses
the
subject
under
five
heads
first
lest
i
may
seem
to
discourse
to
the
populace
how
are
these
our
animals
called
in
the
latin
language
secondly
whether
these
our
animals
can
be
summoned
thirdly
whether
they
can
be
summoned
by
procurators
and
if
they
are
cited
to
appear
personally
whether
they
can
appear
by
proxy
through
procurators
appointed
by
the
judge
who
summons
them
fourthly
what
judge
whether
layman
or
ecclesiastic
is
competent
to
try
them
and
how
he
is
to
proceed
against
them
and
to
pass
and
execute
sentence
upon
them
fifthly
what
constitutes
an
anathema
and
how
does
it
differ
from
an
chassenée
s
method
of
investigation
is
not
that
of
the
philosophic
thinker
who
marshals
facts
under
general
laws
and
traces
them
to
rational
causes
but
combines
that
of
the
lawyer
who
quotes
precedents
and
examines
witnesses
with
that
of
the
theologian
who
balances
authorities
and
serves
us
with
texts
instead
of
arguments
he
scrupulously
avoids
all
psychological
speculation
or
metaphysical
reasoning
and
simply
aims
to
show
that
animals
have
been
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
by
civil
and
ecclesiastical
courts
and
that
the
competence
of
these
tribunals
has
been
generally
recognized
the
documentary
evidence
adduced
is
drawn
from
a
great
variety
of
sources
the
scriptures
of
the
old
and
new

pagan

and

it

or
if
twelve
witnesses
can
be
produced
in
favour
of
a
statement
and
only
two
against

his
reason
bows
to
the
will
of
the
majority
and
accepts
the
proposition
as
proved
it
must
be
added
however
to
his
credit
that
he
proceeds
in
this
matter
with
strict
impartiality

rectitude
takes

is

like
so
many
scholars
of
his
day
he
was
prodigiously
learned
without
being
remarkable
for
clearness
or
originality
of
thought
indeed
the
vastness
of
his
erudition
seems
rather
to
have
hampered
than
helped
the
vigorous
growth
of
his
intellectual
faculties
he
often
indulges
in
logical
subtilties
so
shallow
in
their
speciousness
that
they
ought
not
to
deceive
the
veriest
smatterer
in
dialectics
and
the
reader
is
constantly
tempted
to
answer
his
laboured
argumentations
as
tristram
shandy
s
uncle
toby
did
the
lucubrations
of
corporal
trim
by
whistling
bars
of
the
examples
he
adduces
afford
striking
illustrations
of
the
gross
credulity
to
which
the
strongly
conservative
mind
of
the
jurisconsult
is
apt
to
fall
an
easy
prey
the
habit
of
seeking
knowledge
and
guidance
exclusively
in
the
records
and
traditions
of
the
past
in
the
wisdom
of
ages
renders
him
peculiarly
liable
to
regard
every
act
and
utterance
of
antiquity
as
necessarily
wise
and
authoritative

proof
of
the
power

anathemas

interprets
not
merely
as
the
best
means
of
getting
rid
of
a
cumberer
of
the
orchard
but
as
a
condemnation
and
punishment
of
the
tree
for
its
delinquencies
and
adds
if
therefore
it
is
permitted
to
destroy
an
irrational
thing
because
it
does
not
produce
fruit
much
more
is
it
permitted

it

not

but
for

by
the
voice
of
those
leaves
that
it
had
such

for
being

but
for
being

stricken

the
culpability
and
punishableness
of

object

modern
divine
and
the
mediæval
jurist
occupy
the
same
standpoint
only
the
latter
with
a
stricter
judicial
sense
insists
that
there
shall
be
no
infliction
of
punishment
until
the
malefactor
has
been
convicted
by
due
process
of
law
and
that
he
shall
enjoy
all
the
safeguards
which
legal
forms
and
technicalities
have
thrown
around
him
and
under
whose
covert
even
the
vilest
criminal
has
the
right
to
take
refuge
the
anglican
hermeneutist
on
the
contrary
would
justify
the
curse
and
admit
the
validity
of
the
anathema
although
it
was
only
the
angry
expression
of
an
unreasonable
impatience
disappointed
in
not
finding
fruit
at
the
wrong
season
for
the
time
of
figs
was
not
a
curious
and
characteristic
specimen
of
the
absurd
and
illogical
inferences
which
chassenée
is
constantly
deducing
from
his
texts
is
the
use
he
makes
of
the
passage
in
virgil
s
first
georgic
in
which
the
poet
remarks
that
no
religion
has
forbidden
us
to
draw
off
for
irrigating
purposes
to
enclose
crops
with
fences
or
to
lay
snares
for
birds
all
these
things
being
essential
to
successful
husbandry
but
from
the
right
to
snare
birds
our
jurisprudent
infers
the
right
to
excommunicate
them
since
no
snares
are
stronger
than
the
meshes
of
an
deductions
and
wretched
twaddle
of
this
sort
fill
many
pages
of
the
famous
lawyer
s
dissertation
coming
down
to
more
recent
times
chassenée
mentions
several
instances
of
the
effectiveness
of
anathemas
accepting
as
convincing
testimony
the
ecstacies
of
saints
and
the
extravagant
statements
of
hagiologists
without
the
slightest
expression
of
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
these
legends
thus
he
relates
how
a
priest
anathematized
an
orchard
because
its
fruits
tempted
the
children
of
his
parish
and
kept
them
away
from
mass
the
orchard
remained
barren
until
at
the
solicitation
of
the
duchess
of
burgundy
the
ban
was
removed
in
like
manner
the
bishop
of
lausanne
freed

leman
from
eels
which
had
become
so
numerous
as
seriously
to
interfere
with
boating
and
bathing
on
another
occasion
in
the
year
the
same
ecclesiastic
expelled
from
the
waters
of
this
lake
an
immense
number
of
enormous
which
threatened
to
destroy
all
the
large
fish
and
were
especially
fatal

article
of

on

method
of

both
cheap
and
effective

and
lo
on
the
morrow
they
were
like
sennacherib
s
host
all
dead
william
abbot
of
theodore
in
rheims
who
records
this
miraculous
event
states
that
as
soon
as
the
execration
was
uttered
the
flies
fell
to
the
floor
in
such
quantities
that
they
had
to
be
thrown
out
with
shovels
this
incident
he
adds
was
so
well
known
that
the
cursing
of
the
flies
of
foigny
became
proverbial
and
formed
the
subject
of
a
parable
auctore
wilhelmo
abbate
thod
rhem
i
according
to
the
usual
account
the
malediction
was
not
so
drastic
in
its
operation
and
did
not
cause
the
flies
to
disappear
until
the
next
day
the
rationalist
whose
chill
and
blighting
breath
is
ever
nipping
the
tender
buds
of
faith
would
doubtless
suggest
that
a
sharp
and
sudden
frost
may
have
added
to
the
force
and
efficacy
of
the
excommunication
the
saint
resorted
to
this
severe
and
summary
measure
says
the
monkish
chronicler
because
the
case
was
urgent
and
no
other
remedy
was
at
perhaps
this
lack
of
other
means
of
relief
may
refer
to
the
absence
of
deacons
with
who
according
to
a
contemporary
writer
were
appointed
to
drive
away
the
flies
when
the
pope
the
island
reichenau
in
lake
constance
which
derives
its
name
from
its
fertility
and
is
especially
famous
for
the
products
of
its
vineyards
and
its
orchards
was
once
so
infested
by
venomous
reptiles
as
to
be
uninhabitable
by
human
beings
early
in
the
eighth
century
as
the
legend
goes
it
was
visited
by
pirminius
and
no
sooner
had
he
set
foot
upon
it
than
these
creatures
all
crawled
and
wriggled
into
the
water
so
that
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
covered
for
three
days
and
three
nights
with
serpents
scorpions
and
hideous
worms
peculiar
vermifugal
efficacy
was
ascribed
to
the
crosier
of
magnus
the
apostle
of
algau
which
was
preserved
in
the
cloister
of
mang
at
füssen
in
bavaria
and
from
to
was
repeatedly
borne
in
solemn
procession
to
lucerne
zug
schwyz
and
other
portions
of
switzerland
for
the
expulsion
and
extermination
of
rats
mice
cockchafers
and
other
insects
sometimes
formulas
of
malediction
were
procured
directly
from
the
pope
which
like
saints
curses
could
be
applied
without
legal
formalities
thus
in
the
inhabitants
of
lucerne
paid
four
pistoles
and
one
roman
thaler
for
a
document
of
this
kind
on
the
municipal
council
of
thonou
in
savoy
resolved
to
join
with
other
parishes
of
that
province
to
obtain
from
rome
an
excommunication
against
insects
the
expenses
for
which
are
to
be
assessed
in
the
commune
of
piuro
purchased
from
his
holiness
a
similar
anathema
in
the
same
year
the
common
council
of
chiavenna
discussed
the
propriety
of
applying
to
rome
for
an
execratory
against
beetles
and
bears
and
in
december
it
was
proposed
by
the
same
body
to
take
like
summary
measures
in
order
to
get
rid
of
a
pest
of
rodents
in
and
the
municipal
council
of
lucerne
ordered
processions
to
be
made
on
magnus
day
from
the
church
of
francis
to
peter
s
chapel
for
the
purpose
of
expelling
weevils
this
custom
was
observed
annually
from
to
the
pompous
ceremony
has
been
superseded
in
protestant
countries
by
an
officially
appointed
day
of
fasting
and
prayer
in
his
first
counsel
chassenée
not
only
treats
of
methods
of
procedure
and
gives
forms
of
plaints
to
be
drawn
up
and
tendered
to
the
tribunal
by
the
injured
party
as
well
as
useful
hints
to
the
pettifogger
in
the
exercise
of
his
tortuous
and
tricky
profession
but
he
also
discusses
many
legal
principles
touching
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
the
functions
of
judges
and
other
characteristic
questions
of
civil
criminal
and
canonical
law
animals
he
says
should
be
tried
by
ecclesiastical
tribunals
except
in
cases
where
the
penalty
involves
the
shedding
of
blood
an
ecclesiastical
judge
is
not
competent
causa
and
can
impose
only
canonical
punishments
although
he
may
have
jurisdiction
in
temporal
matters
and
punish
crimes
not
involving
a
capital
sentence
judex
ecclesiasticus
in
causa
sanguinis
non
est
competens
judex
licet
habeat
jurisdictionem
in
temporalibus
et
possit
crimina
poenam
sanguinis
non
is
obviously
the
correct
reading
cons
prim
iv
for
this
reason
the
church
never
condemned
heretics
to
death
but
having
decided
that
they
should
die
gave
them
over
to
the
secular
power
for
formal
condemnation
usually
under
the
hollow
and
hypocritical
pretence
of
recommending
them
to
mercy
in
the
prosecution
of
animals
the
summons
was
commonly
published
from
the
parish
pulpit
and
the
whole
judicial
process
bore
a
distinctively
ecclesiastical
character
in
most
cases
the
presiding
judge
or
official
was
the
vicar
of
the
parish
acting
as
the
deputy
of
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
occasionally
the
curate
officiated
in
this
capacity
sometimes
the
trial
was
conducted
before
a
civil
magistrate
under
the
authority
of
the
church
or
the
matter
was
submitted
to
the
adjudication
of
a
conjurer
who
however
appointed
two
proctors
to
plead
respectively
for
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
and
who
rendered
his
verdict
in
due
legal
form
indeed
the
word
conjurer
seems
to
have
been
used
as
a
popular
designation
of
the
person
whether
priest
or
layman
who
exercised
judicatory
functions
in
such
trials
probably
because
as
a
rule
the
sentence
could
be
executed
only
by
conjuration
or
the
invocation
of
supernatural
aid
another
point
which
strikes
us
very
comically
but
which
had
to
be
decided
before
the
trial
could
proceed
was
whether
the
accused
were
to
be
regarded
as
clergy
or
laity
chassenée
thinks
that
there
is
no
necessity
of
testing
each
individual
case
but
that
animals
should
be
looked
upon
as
lay
persons
this
he
declares
should
be
the
general
presumption
but
if
any
one
wishes
to
affirm
that
they
have
and
are
entitled
to
benefit
of
clergy
the
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
him
and
he
is
bound
to
show
it
estud
probably
our
jurist
would
have
made
an
exception
in
favour
of
the
beetle
which
entomologists
call
it
is
certain
at
any
rate
that
if
a
bug
bearing
this
name
had
been
brought
to
trial
the
learning
and
acuteness
displayed
in
arguing
the
point
in
dispute
would
have
been
astounding
we
laugh
at
the
subtilties
and
quiddities
of
mediæval
theologians
who
seriously
discussed
such
silly
questions
as
the
digestibility
of
the
consecrated
elements
in
the
eucharist
but
the
importance
attached
to
these
trivialities
was
not
so
much
the
peculiarity
of
a
single
profession
as
the
mental
habit
of
the
age
the
result
of
scholastic
training
and
scholastic
methods
of
investigation
which
tainted
law
no
less
than
divinity
nevertheless
the
ancillary
relations
of
all
other
sciences
and
disciplines
to
theology
render
the
latter
chiefly
responsible
for
this
fatal
tendency
chassenée
also
makes
a
distinction
between
punitive
and
preventive
purposes
in
the
prosecution
of
animals
between
inflicting
penalties
upon
them
for
crimes
committed
and
taking
precautionary
measures
to
keep
them
from
doing
damage
by
this
means
he
seeks
to
evade
the
objection
that
animals
are
incapable
of
committing
crimes
because
they
are
not
endowed
with
rational
faculties
he
then
proceeds
to
show
that
things
not
allowable
in
respect
to
crimes
already
committed
are
allowable
in
respect
to
crimes
about
to
be
committed
in
order
to
prevent
thus
a
layman
may
not
arrest
an
ecclesiastic
for
a
delict
fully
consummated
but
may
seize
and
detain
him
in
order
to
hinder
the
consummation
of
a
delict
in
such
cases
an
inferior
may
coerce
and
correct
a
superior
even
an
irrational
creature
may
put
restraint
upon
a
human
being
and
hold
him
back
from
in
illustration
of
this
legal
point
he
cites
an
example
from
holy
writ
where
balaam
the
prophet
and
servant
of
the
most
high
was
rebuked
by
a
chassenée
endeavours
to
clinch
his
argument
as
usual
by
quoting
biblical
texts
and
adducing
incidents
from
legendary
literature
the
province
of
which
would
have
furnished
him
with
better
material
for
the
elucidation
of
his
subject
he
leaves
untouched
simply
because
it
was
unknown
to
him
if
crime
consists
in
the
commission
of
deeds
hurtful
to
other
sentient
beings
knowing
such
actions
to
be
wrong
then
the
lower
animals
are
certainly
guilty
of
criminal
offences
it
is
a
fact
that
birds
beasts
and
insects
living
together
in
communities
have
certain
laws
which
are
designed
to
promote
the
general
welfare
of
the
herd
the
flock
or
the
swarm
and
the
violation
of
which
by
individual
members
they
punish
corporally
or
capitally
as
the
case
may
require
it
is
likewise
undeniable
that
domestic
animals
often
commit
crimes
against
man
and
betray
a
consciousness
of
the
nature
of
their
acts
by
showing
fear
of
detection
or
by
trying
to
conceal
what
they
have
done
man
too
recognizes
their
moral
responsibility
by
inflicting
chastisement
upon
them
and
sometimes
feels
justified
in
putting
incorrigible
offenders
a
vicious
bull
a
thievish
cat
or
a
dog
summarily
to
death
of
course
this
kind
of
punishment
is
chiefly
preventive
nevertheless
it
is
provoked
by
acts
already
perpetrated
and
is
not
wholly
free
from
the
element
of
retributive
justice
such
a
proceeding
however
is
arbitrary
and
autocratic
and
if
systematically
applied
to
human
beings
would
be
denounced
as
intolerable
tyranny
chassenée
insists
that
under
no
circumstances
is
a
penalty
to
be
imposed
except
by
judicial
decision
poena
nunquam
imponitur
nisi
lex
expresse
and
in
support
of
this
principle
refers
to
the
apostle
paul
who
declares
that
sin
is
not
imputed
when
there
is
no
he
appears
to
think
that
any
technical
error
would
vitiate
the
whole
procedure
and
reduce
the
ban
of
the
church
to
mere
if
he
lays
so
great
stress
upon
the
observance
of
legal
forms
which
in
the
criminal
prosecution
of
brute
beasts
strike
us
as
the
caricature
and
farce
of
justice
it
is
because
he
deems
them
essential
to
the
effectiveness
of
an
excommunication
the
slightest
mispronunciation
of
a
word
an
incorrect
accentuation
or
false
intonation
in
uttering
a
spell
suffices
to
dissolve
the
charm
and
nullify
the
occult
workings
of
the
magic
the
lack
of
a
single
link
breaks
the
connection
and
destroys
the
binding
force
of
the
chain
everything
must
be
and
not
ethically
but
ritually
as
prescribed
in
the
old
avestan
formula
hûkhta
all
the
mutterings
and
posturings
which
accompany
the
performance
of
a
brahmanical
sacrifice
or
a
catholic
mass
or
any
other
kind
of
incantation
have
their
significance
and
none
of
them
can
be
omitted
without
marring
the
perfection
of
the
ceremonial
and
impairing
its
power
an
anathema
of
animals
pronounced
in
accordance
with
the
sentence
passed
upon
them
by
a
tribunal
belongs
to
the
same
category
of
conjurations
and
is
rendered
nugatory
by
any
formal
defect
or
judicial
irregularity
sometimes
the
obnoxious
vermin
were
generously
forewarned
thus
the
of
jean
rohin
cardinal
bishop
of
autun
having
been
informed
that
slugs
were
devastating
several
estates
in
different
parts
of
his
diocese
on
the
of
august
ordered
public
processions
to
be
made
for
three
days
in
every
parish
and
enjoined
upon
the
said
slugs
to
quit
the
territory
within
this
period
under
penalty
of
being
accursed
on
the
of
september
a
similar
order
was
issued
at
beaujeu
the
curates
were
charged
to
make
processions
during
the
offices
and
the
slugs
were
warned
three
times
to
cease
from
vexing
the
people
by
corroding
and
consuming
the
herbs
of
the
fields
and
the
vines
and
to
depart
and
if
they
do
not
heed
this
our
command
we
excommunicate
them
and
smite
them
with
our
in
the
official
of
troyes
pronounced
sentence
on
certain
insects
brucos
seu
eurucas
vel
alia
non
dissimilia
animalia
gallicè
probably
a
species
of
which
laid
waste
the
vines
and
threatened
them
with
anathema
unless
they
should
disappear
within
six
days
here
it
is
expressly
stated
that
a
counsellor
was
assigned
to
the
accused
and
a
prosecutor
heard
in
behalf
of
the
aggrieved
inhabitants
as
a
means
of
rendering
the
anathema
more
effective
the
people
are
also
urged
to
be
prompt
and
honest
in
the
payment
of
tithes
chassenée
too
endorses
this
view
and
in
proof
of
its
correctness
refers
to
malachi
where
god
promises
to
rebuke
the
devourer
for
man
s
sake
provided
all
the
tithes
are
brought
into
the
storehouse
the
archives
of
the
old
episcopal
city
of
contain
the
original
records
of
legal
proceedings
instituted
against
some
insects
which
had
ravaged
the
vineyards
of
julien
a
hamlet
situated
on
the
route
over
mt
cenis
and
famous
for
the
excellence
of
its
vintage
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
a
species
of
greenish
weevil
charançon
known
to
entomologists
as
and
called
by
different
names
amblevin
bèche
verpillion
in
different
provinces
of
france
complaint
was
first
made
by
the
of
julien
in
before
françois
bonnivard
doctor
of
laws
the
procurator
pierre
falcon
and
the
advocate
claude
morel
defended
the
insects
and
pierre
ducol
appeared
for
the
plaintiffs
after
the
presentation
and
discussion
of
the
case
by
both
parties
the
official
instead
of
passing
sentence
issued
a
proclamation
dated
the
of
may
recommending
public
prayers
and
beginning
with
the
following
characteristic
preamble
inasmuch
as
god
the
supreme
author
of
all
that
exists
hath
ordained
that
the
earth
should
bring
forth
fruits
and
herbs
not
solely
for
the
sustenance
of
rational
human
beings
but
likewise
for
the
preservation
and
support
of
insects
which
fly
about
on
the
surface
of
the
soil
therefore
it
would
be
unbecoming
to
proceed
with
rashness
and
precipitance
against
the
animals
now
actually
accused
and
indicted
on
the
contrary
it
would
be
more
fitting
for
us
to
have
recourse
to
the
mercy
of
heaven
and
to
implore
pardon
for
our
then
follow
instructions
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
public
prayers
are
to
be
conducted
in
order
to
propitiate
the
divine
wrath
the
people
are
admonished
to
turn
to
the
lord
with
pure
and
undivided
hearts
toto
et
puro
to
repent
of
their
sins
with
unfeigned
contrition
and
to
resolve
to
live
henceforth
justly
and
charitably

above
all
to
pay

high
mass

to
be
celebrated

consecutive
days
namely
on

and
and
the
host
to
be
borne
in
solemn
procession
with
songs
and
supplications
round
the
vineyards
the
first
mass
is
to
be
said
in
honour
of
the
holy
spirit
the
second
in
honour
of
the
blessed
virgin
and

of

tutelar
saint
of

parish
at
least
two
persons
of
each
household
are
required
to
take
part
in
these
religious
exercises
a
signed
by
the
curate
romanet
attests
that
this
programme
was
fully
carried
out
and
that
the
insects
soon
afterwards
disappeared
about
thirty
years
later
however
the
scourge
was
renewed
and
the
destructive
insects
were
actually
brought
to
trial

the
documents

communicated
by
victor

secretary
of
the

to
léon
ménebréa
who
printed
them
in
the
appendix
to
his
volume
l
origine

de

jugements
rendus

this
treatise
appeared
originally
in
the
twelfth
tome
of
the
de
la
société
royale
académique
de
it
may
be
proper
to
add
that
ménebréa
s
theory
of
the
spirit
in
which
these
judgments
against
animals
were
given
is
wholly
untenable
he
maintains
that
these
procedures
formed
originally
only
a
kind
of
symbol
intended
to
revive
the
sentiment
of
justice
among
the
masses
of
the
people
who
knew
of
no
right
except
might
and
of
no
law
except
that
of
intimidation
and
violence
in
the
middle
ages
when
disorder
reigned
supreme
when
the
weak
remained
without
support
and
without
redress
against
the
strong
and
property
was
exposed
to
all
sorts
of
attacks
and
all
forms
of
ravage
and
rapine
there
was
something
indescribably
beautiful
in
the
thought
of
assimilating
the
insect
of
the
field
to
the
masterpiece
of
creation
and
putting
them
on
an
equality
before
the
law
if
man
should
be
taught
to
respect
the
home
of
the
worm
how
much
more
ought
he
to
regard
that
of
his
and
learn
to
rule
in
this
explanation
is
very
fine
in
sentiment
but
expresses
a
modern
and
not
a
mediæval
way
of
thinking
the
penal
prosecution
of
animals
which
prevailed
during
the
middle
ages
was
by
no
means
peculiar
to
that
period
but
has
been
frequently
practised
by
primitive
peoples
and
savage
tribes
neither
was
it
designed
to
inculcate
any
such
moral
lesson
as
is
here
suggested
nor
did
it
produce
any
such
desirable
result
so
far
from
originating
in
a
delicate
and
sensitive
sense
of
justice
it
was
as
will
be
more
fully
shown
hereafter
the
outcome
of
an
extremely
crude
obtuse
and
barbaric
sense
of
justice
it
was
the
product
of
a
social
state
in
which
dense
ignorance
was
governed
by
brute
force
and
is
not
to
be
considered
as
a
reaction
and
protest
against
which
it
really
tended
to
foster
by
making
a
travesty
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
thus
turning
it
into
ridicule
it
was
also
in
the
interest
of
ecclesiastical
dignities
to
keep
up
this
parody
and
perversion
of
a
sacred
and
fundamental
institute
of
civil
society
since
it
strengthened
their
influence
and
extended
their
authority
by
subjecting
even
the
caterpillar
and
the
to
their
dominion
and
control
but
to
return
to
the
records
of
the
trial
on
the
of
april
the
case
was
laid
before
his
most
reverend
lordship
the
of
maurienne
or
the
reverend
lord
his
and
official
by
the
syndics
and
procurators
françois
amenet
and
petremand
bertrand
who
in
the
name
of
the
inhabitants
of
julien
presented
the
following
statement
and
petition
formerly
by
virtue
of
divine
services
and
earnest
supplications
the
scourge
and
inordinate
fury
of
the
aforesaid
animals
did
cease
now
they
have
resumed
their
depredations
and
are
doing
incalculable
injury
if
the
sins
of
men
are
the
cause
of
this
evil
it
behoveth
the
representatives
of
christ
on
earth
to
prescribe
such
measures
as
may
be
appropriate
to
appease
the
divine
wrath
wherefore
we
the
syndics
françois
amenet
and
petremand
bertrand
do
appear
anew
and
beseech
the
official
first
to
appoint
another
procurator
and
advocate
for
the
insects
in
place
of
the
deceased
pierre
falcon
and
claude
morel
and
secondly
to
visit
the
grounds
and
observe
the
damage
and
then
to
proceed
with
the
in
compliance
with
this
request
the
distinguished
antoine
filliol
was
appointed
procurator
for
the
insects
with
a
moderate
fee
and
pierre
rembaud
their
advocate
the
parties
appeared
before
the
official
on
the
day
of
may
and
the
case
was
adjourned
to
the
of
june
when
the
advocate
pierre
rembaud
presented
his
answer
to
the
declaration
of
the
plaintiffs
showing
that
their
action
is
not
maintainable
and
that
they
should
be
nonsuited
after
approving
of
the
course
pursued
by
his
predecessor
in
office
he
affirms
that
his
clients
have
kept
within
their
right
and
not
rendered
themselves
liable
to
excommunication
since
as
we
read
in
the
sacred
book
of
genesis
the
lower
animals
were
created
before
man
and
god
said
to
them
let
the
earth
bring
forth
the
living
creature
after
his
kind
cattle
and
creeping
thing
and
beast
of
the
earth
after
his
kind
and
he
blessed
them
saying
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
fill
the
waters
of
the
seas
and
let
fowl
multiply
in
the
earth
now
the
creator
would
not
have
given
this
command
had
he
not
intended
that
these
creatures
should
have
suitable
and
sufficient
means
of
support
indeed
he
has
expressly
stated
that
to
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
every
green
herb
has
been
given
for
meat
it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
accused
in
taking
up
their
abode
in
the
vines
of
the
plaintiffs
are
only
exercising
a
legitimate
right
conferred
upon
them
at
the
time
of
their
creation
furthermore
it
is
absurd
and
unreasonable
to
invoke
the
power
of
civil
and
canonical
law
against
brute
beasts
which
are
subject
only
to
natural
law
and
the
impulses
of
instinct
the
argument
urged
by
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
that
the
lower
animals
are
made
subject
to
man
he
dismisses
as
neither
true
in
fact
nor
pertinent
to
the
present
case
he
suggests
that
the
complainants
instead
of
instituting
judicial
proceedings
would
do
better
to
entreat
the
mercy
of
heaven
and
to
imitate
the
ninevites
who
when
they
heard
the
warning
voice
of
the
prophet
jonah
proclaimed
a
fast
and
put
on
sackcloth
in
conclusion
he
demands
that
the
petition
of
the
plaintiffs
be
dismissed
the
monitorium
revoked
and
annulled
and
all
further
proceedings
stayed
to
which
end
the
gracious
office
of
the
judge
is
humbly
implored
implorato
benigno
officio
the
case
was
adjourned
to
the
and
finally
to
the
of
june
when
petremand
bertrand
the
prosecuting
attorney
presented
a
lengthy
replication
of
which
the
defendants
advocate
demanded
a
copy
with
due
time
for
deliberation
this
request
led
to
a
further
adjournment
till
the
of
june
but
as
this
day
turned
out
to
be
a
or
holiday
no
business
could
be
transacted
until
the
when
the
advocate
of
the
commune
françois
fay
who
seems
to
have
taken
the
place
of
amenet
if
he
be
not
the
same
person
in
reply
to
the
defendants
plea
argued
that
although
the
animals
were
created
before
man
they
were
intended
to
be
subordinate
to
him
and
subservient
to
his
use
and
that
this
was
indeed
the
reason
of
their
prior
creation
they
have
no
d
except
as
they
minister
to
man
who
was
made
to
have
dominion
over
them
inasmuch
as
all
things
have
been
put
under
his
feet
as
the
psalmist
asserts
and
the
apostle
paul
reiterates
on
this
point
he
concludes
our
opponent
has
added
nothing
refutatory
of
the
views
which
have
been
held
from
time
immemorial
by
our
ancestors
we
need
only
refer
to
the
opinions
formerly
expressed
by
the
honourable
hippolyte
ducol
as
satisfactory
the
advocate
for
the
defence
merely
remarked
that
he
had
not
yet
received
the
document
ordered
on
the
of
june
and
the
further
consideration
of
the
case
was
postponed
till
the
of
july
antoine
filliol
then
made
a
rejoinder
to
the
plaintiffs
replication
denying
that
the
subordination
of
the
lower
animals
to
man
involves
the
right
of
excommunicating
them
and
insisting
upon
his
former
position
which
the
opposing
counsel
had
not
even
attempted
to
disprove
namely
that
the
lower
animals
are
subject
solely
to
natural
law
a
law
originating
in
the
eternal
reason
and
resting
upon
a
basis
as
immutable
as
that
of
the
divine
law
of
revelation
since
they
are
derived
from
the
same
source
namely
the
will
and
power
of
it
is
evident
he
adds
that
the
action
brought
by
the
plaintiffs
is
not
maintainable
and
that
judgment
should
be
given
accordingly
on
the
of
july
the
same
parties
appear
before
the
official
of
the
procurator
of
the
insects
demands
that
the
case
be
closed
and
the
plaintiffs
debarred
from
drawing
up
any
additional
statements
or
creating
any
further
delay
by
the
introduction
of
irrelevant
matter
and
requests
that
a
decision
be
rendered
on
the
documents
and
declarations
already
adduced
the
prosecuting
attorney
whose
policy
seems
to
have
been
to
keep
the
suit
pending
as
long
as
possible
applies
for
a
new
term
which
was
granted
meanwhile
in
view
of
the
law
s
long
delay
other
measures
were
taken
for
the
speedier
adjustment
of
the
affair
by
compromise
on
the
of
june
a
public
meeting
was
called
at
noon
immediately
after
mass
on
the
great
square
of
julien
known
as
parloir
d
amont
to
which
all
hinds
and
habitants
et
were
summoned
by
the
ringing
of
the
church
bell
to
consider
the
propriety
and
necessity
of
providing
for
the
said
animals
a
place
outside
of
the
vineyards
of
julien
where
they
might
obtain
sufficient
sustenance
without
devouring
and
devastating
the
vines
of
the
said
commune
this
meeting
appears
to
have
been
held
by
the
advice
of
the
plaintiffs
advocate
françois
fay
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
official
a
piece
of
ground
in
the
vicinity
was
selected
and
set
apart
as
a
sort
of
insect
enclosure
the
inhabitants
of
julien
however
reserving
for
themselves
the
right
to
pass
through
the
said
tract
of
land
without
prejudice
to
the
pasture
of
the
said
animals
and
to
make
use
of
the
springs
of
water
contained
therein
which
are
also
to
be
at
the
service
of
the
said
animals
they
reserve
furthermore
the
right
of
working
the
mines
of
ochre
and
other
mineral
colours
found
there
without
doing
detriment
to
the
means
of
subsistence
of
said
animals
and
finally
the
right
of
taking
refuge
in
this
spot
in
time
of
war
or
in
case
of
like
distress
the
place
chosen
is
called
la
grand
feisse
and
described
with
the
exactness
of
a
topographical
survey
not
only
as
to
its
location
and
dimensions
but
also
as
to
the
character
of
its
foliage
and
herbage
the
assembled
people
vote
to
make
this
appropriation
of
land
and
agree
to
draw
up
a
conveyance
of
it
in
good
form
and
of
perpetual
validity
provided
the
procurator
and
advocate
of
the
insects
may
on
visitation
and
inspection
of
the
ground
express
themselves
satisfied
with
such
an
arrangement
in
witness
whereof
the
protocol
is
signed
l
prunier
curial
and
stamped
with
the
seal
of
the
commune
but
this
attempt
of
the
inhabitants
to
conciliate
the
insects
and
to
settle
their
differences
by
mutual
concessions
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
litigation
on
the
of
july
an
extract
from
the
register
of
the
curiality
of
julien
containing
the
proceedings
of
the
public
meeting
was
submitted
to
the
court
by
petremand
bertrand
procurator
of
the
plaintiffs
who
called
attention
to
the
very
generous
offer
made
by
the
commune
and
prayed
the
official
to
order
the
grant
to
be
accepted
on
the
conditions
specified
and
to
cause
the
defendants
to
vacate
the
vineyards
and
to
forbid
them
to
return
to
the
same
on
pain
of
excommunication
antoine
filliol
procurator
of
the
insects
requested
a
copy
of
the
and
time
for
deliberation
the
court
complied
with
this
request
and
adjourned
the
case
till
the
first
juridical
day
after
the
harvest
vacation
which
fell
on
the
of
august
and
again
by
common
consent
till
the
of
the
same
month
at
this
time
charles
emanuel
duke
of
savoy
was
preparing
to
invade
the
marquisate
of
saluzzo
and
the
confusion
caused
by
the
expedition
of
troops
over
mt
cenis
interfered
with
the
progress
of
the
trial
which
was
postponed
till
the
of
august
and
again
since
the
passage
of
armed
men
was
still
going
on
transitu
till
the
of
september
when
antoine
filliol
declared
that
he
could
not
accept
for
his
clients
the
offer
made
by
the
plaintiffs
because
the
place
was
sterile
and
neither
sufficiently
nor
suitably
supplied
with
food
for
the
support
of
the
said
animals
he
demanded
therefore
that
the
proposal
be
rejected
and
the
action
dismissed
with
costs
to
the
complainants
agentes
repelli
cum
the
egregious
petremand
bertrand
in
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
denies
the
correctness
of
this
statement
and
avers
that
the
spot
selected
and
set
apart
as
an
abode
for
the
insects
is
admirably
adapted
to
this
purpose
being
full
of
trees
and
shrubs
of
divers
kinds
as
stated
in
the
conveyance
prepared
by
his
clients
all
of
which
he
is
ready
to
verify
he
insists
therefore
upon
an
adjudication
in
his
favour
the
official
took
the
papers
of
both
parties
and
reserved
his
decision
appointing
experts
who
should
in
the
meantime
examine
the
place
which
the
plaintiffs
had
proffered
as
an
asylum
for
the
insects
and
submit
a
written
report
upon
the
fitness
of
the
same
the
final
decision
of
the
case
after
such
careful
deliberation
and
so
long
delay
is
rendered
doubtful
by
the
unfortunate
circumstance
that
the
last
page
of
the
records
has
been
destroyed
by
rats
or
bugs
of
some
sort
perhaps
the
prosecuted
weevils
not
being
satisfied
with
the
results
of
the
trial
sent
a
delegation
into
the
archives
to
obliterate
and
annul
the
judgment
of
the
court
at
least
nothing
should
be
thought
incredible
or
impossible
in
the
conduct
of
creatures
which
were
deemed
worthy
of
being
summoned
before
ecclesiastical
tribunals
and
which
succeeded
as
criminals
in
claiming
the
attention
and
calling
forth
the
legal
learning
and
acumen
of
the
greatest
jurists
of
their
day
in
the
margin
of
the
last
page
are
some
interesting
items
of
expenses
incurred

by
which
we
are
to
understand
three
florins
to
the
experts

may
be
summed
up
as
sixteen
florins
for

three

not

was
not
permitted
to
go
away
the
date
which
follows
may
be
assumed
to
indicate
the
time
at
which
the
trial
came
to
an
end
after
a
pendency
of
more
than
eight
months
appendix
a
in
the
legal
proceedings
just
described
two
points
are
presented
with
great
clearness
and
seem
to
be
accepted
as
incontestable
first
the
right
of
the
insects
to
adequate
means
of
subsistence
suited
to
their
nature
this
right
was
recognized
by
both
parties
even
the
prosecution
did
not
deny
it
but
only
maintained
that
they
must
not
trespass
cultivated
fields
and
destroy
the
fruits
of
man
s
labour
the
complainants
were
perfectly
willing
to
assign
to
the
weevils
an
uncultivated
tract
of
ground
where
they
could
feed
upon
such
natural
products
of
the
soil
as
were
not
due
to
human
toil
and
tillage
secondly
no
one
appears
to
have
doubted
for
a
moment
that
the
church
could
by
virtue
of
its
anathema
compel
these
creatures
to
stop
their
ravages
and
cause
them
to
go
from
one
place
to
another
indeed
a
firm
faith
in
the
existence
of
this
power
was
the
pivot
on
which
the
whole
procedure
turned
and
without
it
the
trial
would
have
been
a
dismal
farce
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
took
part
in
it
it
is
related
in
the
chronicles
of
an
ancient
abbey
père
rochex
gloire
de
l
abbaye
et
vallée
de
la
that
eldrad
commanded
the
snakes
which
infested
the
environs
of
a
priory
in
the
valley
of
briançon
to
depart
and
taking
a
staff
in
his
hand
conducted
them
to
a
desert
place
and
shut
them
up
in
a
cave
where
they
all
miserably
perished
perhaps
the
serpent
which
suffered
satan
to
take
possession
of
its
seductive
form
and
thus
played
such
a
fatal
part
in
effecting
the
fall
of
man
and
in
introducing
sin
into
the
world
may
have
been
regarded
as
completely
out
of
the
pale
and
protection
of
law
and
as
having
no
rights
which
an
ecclesiastical
excommunicator
or
a
saint
would
be
bound
to
respect
as
a
rule
however
such
an
arbitrary
abuse
of
miraculous
power
to
the
injury
or
destruction
of
god
s
creatures
was
considered
illegal
and
unjustifiable
although
irascible
anchorites
and
other
holy
men
under
strong
provocation
often
gave
way
to
it
mediæval
jurists
frowned
upon
summary
measures
of
this
sort
just
as
modern
lawyers
condemn
the
practice
of
as
mobbish
and
essentially
seditious
and
only
to
be
excused
as
a
sudden
outburst
of
public
indignation
at
some
exceptionally
brutal
outrage
properly
speaking
animals
can
not
be
excommunicated
but
only
anathematized
just
as
women
according
to
old
english
law
having
no
legal
status
of
their
own
and
not
being
bound
in
frankpledge
as
members
of
the
decennary
or
tithable
community
could
not
be
outlawed
but
only
waived
or
abandoned
this
form
of
ban
while
differing
theoretically
from
actual
outlawry
was
practically
the
same
in
its
effects
upon
the
individual
subjected
to
it
excommunication
is
as
the
etymology
of
the
word
implies
the
exclusion
from
the
communion
of
the
church
and
from
whatever
spiritual
or
temporal
advantages
may
accrue
to
a
person
from
this
relation
it
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
an
anathema
but
is
limited
in
its
operation
to
members
of
the
ecclesiastical
body
to
which
the
lower
animals
do
not
belong
this
was
the
generally
accepted
view
and
is
the
opinion
maintained
by
gaspard
bailly
advocate
and
councillor
of
the
sovereign
senate
of
savoy
in
his
des
monitoires
avec
un
plaidoyer
contre
les
printed
at
lyons
in
but
it
has
not
always
been
held
by
writers
on
this
subject
some
of
whom
do
not
recognize
this
distinction
between
anathema
and
excommunication
on
the
authority
of
many
passages
of
holy
writ
affirming
that
as
the
whole
creation
was
corrupted
by
the
fall
so
the
atonement
extends
to
all
living
creatures
which
are
represented
as
longing
for
the
day
of
their
redemption
and
regeneration
one
of
the
strong
points
made
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
in
prosecutions
of
this
kind
was
that
these
insects
were
sent
to
punish
man
for
his
sins
and
should
therefore
be
regarded
as
agents
and
emissaries
of
the
almighty
and
that
to
attempt
to
destroy
them
or
to
drive
them
away
would
be
to
fight
against
god
en
prendre
à
under
such
circumstances
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
not
to
seek
legal
redress
and
to
treat
the
noxious
creatures
as
criminals
but
to
repent
and
humbly
to
entreat
an
angry
deity
to
remove
the
scourge
this
is
still
the
standpoint
of
christian
orthodoxy
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
and
the
argument
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
impious
and
atheistic
substitution
of
paris
green
and
the
chlorate
of
lime
for
prayer
and
fasting
as
exterminators
of
the
modern
like
the
mediæval
horticulturist
may
ward
off
devouring
vermin
from
his
garden
by
the
use
of
ashes
but
he
strews
them
on
his
plants
instead
of
sprinkling
them
on
his
own
head
and
thus
indicates
to
what
extent
scientific
have
superseded
theological
methods
in
the
practical
affairs
of
life
thomas
aquinas
the
angelic
doctor
in
his
raises
the
query
whether
it
is
permissible
to
curse
irrational
creatures
liceat
irrationabiles
creaturas
he
states
in
the
first
place
that
curses
and
blessings
can
be
pronounced
only
upon
such
things
as
are
susceptible
of
receiving
evil
or
good
impressions
from
them
or
in
other
words
upon
sentient
and
rational
beings
or
upon
irrational
creatures
and
insentient
things
in
their
relation
to
rational
beings
so
that
the
latter
are
the
objects
ultimately
aimed
at
and
favourably
or
unfavourably
affected
thus
god
cursed
the
earth
because
it
is
essential
to
a
man
s
subsistence
jesus
cursed
the
barren
symbolizing
the
jews
who
made
a
great
show
of
leafage
in
the
form
of
rites
and
ceremonies
but
bore
no
fruits
of
righteousness
job
cursed
the
day
on
which
he
was
born
because
he
took
from
his
mother
s
womb
the
taint
of
original
sin
david
cursed
the
rocks
and
mountains
of
gilboa
because
they
were
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
beauty
of
israel
in
like
manner
the
lord
sends
locusts
and
blight
and
mildew
to
destroy
the
harvests
because
these
are
intimately
connected
with
the
happiness
of
mankind
whose
sins
he
wishes
to
punish
it
is
laid
down
as
a
legal
maxim
by
mediæval
jurisprudents
that
no
animal
devoid
of
understanding
can
commit
a
fault
enim
potest
animal
injuriam
fecisse
quod
sensu
this
doctrine
is
endorsed
by
the
great
theologian
and
scholastic
thomas
of
aquino
if
we
regard
the
lower
animals
he
says
as
creatures
coming
from
the
hand
of
god
and
employed
by
him
as
agents
for
the
execution
of
his
judgments
then
to
curse
them
would
be
blasphemous
if
on
the
other
hand
we
curse
them
merely
as
brute
beasts
then
the
malediction
is
odious
and
vain
and
therefore
unlawful
odiosum
et
vanum
et
per
consequens
there
is
however
another
ground
on
which
the
right
of
excommunication
or
anathematization
may
be
asserted
and
fully
vindicated
namely
that
the
lower
animals
are
satellites
of
satan
instigated
by
the
powers
of
hell
and
therefore
proper
to
be
cursed
as
the
doctor
angelicus
puts
it
chassenée
refers
to
this
opinion
in
the
treatise
already
cited
i
and
adds
the
anathema
then
is
not
to
be
pronounced
against
the
animals
as
such
but
should
be
hurled
inferentially
modum
at
the
devil
who
makes
use
of
irrational
creatures
to
our
this
notion
seems
to
have
been
generally
accepted
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
fact
that
evil
spirits
are
often
mentioned
in
the
bible
metaphorically
or
symbolically
as
animals
and
assumed
to
be
incarnate
in
the
adder
the
asp
the
basilisk
the
dragon
the
lion
the
leviathan
the
serpent
the
scorpion
was
considered
confirmatory
of
this
view
but
not
all
animals
were
regarded
as
diabolical
incarnations
on
the
contrary
many
were
revered
as
embodiments
and
emblems
of
divine
perfections
in
a
work
entitled
liure
du
roy
modus
et
de
la
reyne
the
book
of
king
mode
and
queen
reason
which
as
the
colophon
records
was
printed
at
chambery
by
anthony
neyret
in
the
year
of
grace
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
on
the
thirtieth
day
of
october
king
mode
discourses
on
falconry
and
venery
in
general
queen
reason
brings
forward
in
reply
to
these
rather
conventional
commonplaces
several
fine
moralities
and
dilates
on
the
natural
and
mystic
qualities
of
animals
which
she
divides
into
two
classes
sweet
beasts
and
stenchy
beasts
foremost
among
the
sweet
beasts
stands
that
which
milton
characterizes
as
goodliest
of
all
the
forest
hart
and
according
to
the
psalmist
the
hart
panting
after
the
represents
the
soul
thirsting
for
the
living
god
and
is
the
type
of
religious
ardour
and
aspiration
it
plays
an
important
part
in
the
legends
of
saints
acts
as
their
guide
shows
them
where
holy
relics
are
concealed
and
causes
eustace
and
hubert
to
abandon
the
chase
and
to
lead
lives
of
pious
devotion
by
appearing
to
them
with
a
luminous
cross
between
its
antlers
the
ten
branches
of
its
horns
symbolize
the
ten
commandments
of
the
old
testament
and
signify
in
the
roman
ritual
the
ten
fingers
of
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
priest
as
he
works
the
perpetual
miracle
of
transubstantiation
of
the
eucharist
chief
of
the
stenchy
beasts
is
the
pig
in
paganism
which
to
the
christians
was
merely
the
boar
was
an
object
of
peculiar
adoration
for
this
reason
the
farrow
of
the
sow
is
supposed
to
number
seven
shotes
corresponding
to
the
seven
deadly
sins
to
the
same
class
of
offensive
beasts
belong
the
wolf
typical
of
bad
spiritual
shepherds
and
the
fox
which
is
described
as
follows
reynard
is
a
beast
of
small
size
with
red
hair
a
long
bushy
tail
and
an
evil
physiognomy
for
his
visage
is
thin
and
sharp
his
eyes
and
piercing
his
ears
small
straight
and
pointed
moreover
he
is
deceitful
and
tricky
above
all
other
beasts
and
exceedingly
we
are
all
adds
queen
reason
in
a
moralizing
strain
more
or
less
of
the
brotherhood
of
saint
fausset
whose
influence
is
quite
among
birds
the
raven
is
a
malodorous
creature
and
imp
of
satan
whereas
the
dove
is
a
sweet
beast
and
the
chosen
vessel
for
the
outpouring
of
the
holy
spirit
the
form
in
which
the
third
person
of
the
trinity
became
incarnate
this
division
of
beasts
corresponds
in
principle
to
that
which
is
given
in
the
avesta
and
according
to
which
all
animals
are
regarded
as
belonging
either
to
the
good
creation
of
ahuramazda
or
to
the
evil
creation
of
the
world
is
the
scene
of
perpetual
conflict
between
these
hostile
forces
summed
up
in
the
religion
and
ethics
of
zarathushtra
as
the
trinity
of
the
good
thought
the
good
word
and
the
good
deed
which
are
to
be
fostered
in
opposition
to
the
evil
thought
the
evil
word
and
the
evil
deed
which
are
to
be
constantly
combated
and
finally
suppressed
every
man
is
called
upon
by
the
iranian
prophet
to
choose
between
these
contraries
and
not
only
the
present
and
future
state
of
his
own
soul
the
complexion
of
his
individual
character
but
also
the
welfare
of
the
whole
world
the
ultimate
destiny
of
the
universe
depend
to
no
inconsiderable
extent
upon
his
choice
his
thoughts
words
and
deeds
do
not
cease
with
the
immediate
effect
which
they
are
intended
to
produce
but
like
force
in
the
physical
world
are
persistent
and
indestructible
as
the
very
slightest
impulse
given
to
an
atom
of
matter
communicates
itself
to
every
other
atom
and
thus
disturbs
the
equilibrium
of
the
globe
the
footfall
of
a
child
shaking
the
earth
to
its
centre
so
the
influence
of
every
human
life
however
small
contributes
to
the
general
increase
and
ascendency
of
either
good
or
evil
and
helps
to
determine
which
of
these
principles
shall
ultimately
triumph
in
the
universal
strife
of
these
mighty
opposites
the
vicious
are
the
allies
of
the
devil
while
the
virtuous
are
not
merely
engaged
in
working
out
their
own
salvation
but
have
also
the
ennobling
consciousness
of
being
with
the
deity
who
needs
and
appreciates
their
services
in
overcoming
the
adversary
this
sense
of
solidarity
with
the
best
and
the
highest
imparts
additional
elevation
and
peculiar
dignity
to
human
aims
and
actions
and
lends
to
devotion
a
warmth
of
sympathy
and
fervour
of
enthusiasm
springing
from
personal
attachment
and
loyalty
which
it
is
difficult
for
the
religion
of
humanity
to
inspire
the
fact
too
that
evil
exists
in
the
world
not
by
the
will
and
design
of
the
good
being
but
in
spite
of
him
and
that
all
his
powers
are
put
forth
to
eradicate
it
while
detracting
from
his
omnipotence
frees
him
from
all
moral
obliquity
and
exalts
his
character
for
benevolence
thus
rendering
him
far
more
worthy
of
love
and
worship
and
a
much
better
model
for
human
imitation
than
that
dreadful
idealization
of
wickedness
which
is
called
god
in
the
calvinistic
creed
the
idea
that
the
humblest
person
may
by
the
purity
and
rectitude
of
his
life
not
only
strengthen
himself
in
virtue
but
also
increase
the
actual
aggregate
of
goodness
in
the
universe
and
even
endue
the
deity
with
greater
power
and
aggressive
energy
in
subduing
and
extirpating
evil
is
surely
a
sublime
thought
and
a
source
of
lofty
inspiration
and
encouragement
in
although
it
has
been
degraded
by
parsi
dasturs
as
all
grand
conceptions
and
ideals
are
apt
to
be
under
priestly
influences
into
a
ridiculous
and
childish
hatred
of
snakes
scorpions
frogs
lizards
and
other
animals
supposed
to
have
been
produced
by
plato
held
a
similar
theory
of
creation
regarding
it
not
as
the
manifestation
of
pure
benevolence
endowed
with
almighty
power
but
rather
as
the
expression
of
perfect
goodness
working
at
disadvantage
in
an
intractable
material
which
by
its
inherent
stubbornness
prevented
the
full
embodiment
and
realization
of
the
original
purpose
and
desire
of
the
creator
or
cosmourgos
who
was
therefore
obliged
to
content
himself
with
what
was
under
the
circumstances
the
only
possible
but
by
no
means
the
best
imaginable
world
the
manicheans
attributed
the
same
unsatisfactory
result
to
the
activity
of
an
evil
principle
which
thwarted
the
complete
actualization
of
the
designs
of
the
deity
so
conspicuous
indeed
is
the
defectiveness
of
nature
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
highest
conceivable
human
happiness
so
marked
and
manifold
are
the
causes
of
suffering
in
all
spheres
of
sentient
existence
and
so
often
do
the
elements
seem
to
conspire
for
the
destruction
of
mankind
raging
relentlessly
like
a
wild
beast
red
in
tooth
and
claw
with
ravin
that
every
cosmogony
has
been
compelled
to
assume
the
persistent
intervention
of
some
malignant
spirit
or
perverse
agency
as
the
only
rational
explanation
of
such
a
condition
of
things
the
orthodox
christianity
of
gives
over
the
earth
entirely
to
the
sovereignty
of
satan
the
successful
usurper
of
eden
and
instead
of
bidding
the
righteous
to
look
forward
to
the
final
and
absolute
supremacy
of
truth
and
goodness
in
this
world
as
the
one
divine
event
to
which
the
whole
creation
moves
consoles
them
with
the
vague
promise
of
compensation
in
a
future
state
of
being
even
this
remote
prospect
of
redemption
is
confined
to
a
select
few
not
only
is
the
earth
destined
to
be
burned
with
fire
on
account
of
its
utter
corruption
but
the
great
majority
of
its
inhabitants
are
doomed
to
eternal
torments
in
the
abode
of
evil
spirits
scientific
research
also
leads
to
the
same
conclusions
in
respect
to
the
incompleteness
of
nature
s
handiwork
which
it
is
the
function
of
art
and
culture
to
amend
and
improve
everywhere
the
correcting
hand
and
contriving
brain
of
man
are
needed
to
eliminate
the
worthless
and
noxious
productions
in
which
nature
is
so
fatally
prolific
and
to
foster
and
develop
those
that
are
useful
and
salutary
thus
beautifying
and
ennobling
all
forms
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
by
a
like
process
man
himself
has
attained
his
present
through
long
ages
of
strife
and
struggle
he
has
emerged
from
brutishness
and
barbarism
and
rising
by
a
slow
spiral
ascent
scarcely
perceptible
for
generations
has
been
able
gradually
to
move
upward
working
out
the
beast
and
let
the

in

he
becomes

at
the

time
every
advance
which
he
makes
in
civilization
brings
with
it
some
new
evil
for
him
to
overcome
or
as
the
parsi
would
express
it
mythologically
every
conquest
achieved
by
ahuramazda
and
his
allies
stimulates
angrômainyush
and
his
satellites
to
renewed
exertions
who
convert
the
most
useful
discoveries
like
dynamite
into
instruments
of
diabolical
devastation
the
opening
of
the
far
west
in
the
united
states
to
agriculture
and
commerce
and
the
completion
of
the
pacific
railroad
not
only
served
to
multiply
and
diffuse
the
gifts
of
the
beneficent
and
bountiful
spirit
but
also
facilitated
the

of
the
plagues
of

beetle
the
power
of
destruction
insidiously
concealed
in

often
exceeds
that
of

and
baffles
the
most
persistent
efforts
of
human
ingenuity
to
resist

the

of

defying
at

all
the
appliances
of

for
their
extermination

attempts
of
casuistic
theology
to
reconcile
such
scourges
with
a
perfectly
benevolent
and
omnipotent
creator
and
ruler
of
the
universe
it
is
the
observation
of
phenomena
like
these
that
confirms
the
modern
parsi
in
the
faith
of
his
fathers
and
reveals
to
him
in
the
operations
of
nature
and
the
conflicts
of
life
unquestionable
evidences
of
a
contest
between
warring
elements
personified
as
hormazd
and
ahriman
the
ultimate
issue
of
which
is
to
be
the
complete
triumph
of
the
former
and
the
consequent
purification
and
redemption
of
the
world
from
the
curse
of
evil
the
parsi
however
recognizes
no
saviour
and
repudiates
as
absurd
and
immoral
any
scheme
of
atonement
whereby
the
burden
of
sin
can
be
shifted
from
the
shoulders
of
the
guilty
to
those
of
an
innocent
vicarious
victim
every
person
must
be
redeemed
by
his
own
good
thoughts
words
and
deeds
as
creation
must
be
redeemed
by
the
good
thoughts
words
and
deeds
of
the
race
after
death
the
character
of
each
individual
thus
formed
appears
to
him
either
in
the
form
of
a
beautiful
and
brilliant
maiden
who
leads
him
over
the
chinvad
or
gatherer
s
bridge
into
the
realms
of
everlasting
light
or
in
the
form
of
a
foul
harlot
who
thrusts
him
down
into
regions
of
eternal
gloom
but
to
return
from
this
digression
it
is
not
only
in
the
venidad
that
certain
classes
of
animals
are
declared
to
be
creations
of
the
archfiend
and
therefore
embodiments
of
devils
additional
proofs
of
this
doctrine
were
derived
by
mediæval
writers
from
biblical
and
classical
sources
a
favourite
example
was
the
metamorphosis
of
nebuchadnezzar
who
when
given
over
to
satan
dwelt
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
ate
grass
as
oxen
while
his
hair
grew
like
eagles
feathers
and
his
nails
like
birds
claws
still
more
numerous
and
striking
instances
of
this
kind
were
drawn
from
pagan
mythology
which
being
of
diabolical
origin
would
naturally
be
prolific
of
such
phenomena
thus
besides
centaurs
and
satyrs
dire
chimeras
and
other
delicate
monsters
there
were
hybrids
like
the
cecrops
and
transformations
by
which
io
became
a
heifer
dædalion
a
corone
a
crow
actæon
a
stag

philomela
a

progne
a

cadmus
and
his
spouse
harmonia
snakes
decertis
a
fish
galanthis
a

and
the
warriors
of
diomedes
birds
while
the
companions
of
ulysses
were
changed
by
circe
the
prototype
of
the
modern
witch
into
swine
all
these
metamorphoses
are
adduced
as
the
results
of
satanic
agencies
and
proofs
of
the
tendency
of
evil
spirits
to
manifest
themselves
in
bestial
forms
towards
the
end
of
the
ninth
century
the
region
about
rome
was
visited
by
a
dire
plague
of
locusts
a
reward
was
offered
for
their
extermination
and
the
peasants
gathered
and
destroyed
them
by
millions
but
all
efforts
were
in
vain
since
they
propagated
faster
than
it
was
possible
to
kill
them
finally
pope
stephen
vi
prepared
great
quantities
of
holy
water
and
had
the
whole
country
sprinkled
with
it
whereupon
the
locusts
immediately
disappeared
the
formula
used
in
consecrating
the
water
and
devoting
it
to
this
purpose
implies
the
diabolical
character
of
the
vermin
against
which
it
was
directed
i
adjure
thee
creature
water
i
adjure
thee
by
the
living
god
by
him
who
at
the
beginning
separated
thee
from
the
dry
land
by
the
true
god
who
caused
thee
to
fertilize
the
garden
of
eden
and
parted
thee
into
four
heads
by
him
who
at
the
marriage
of
cana
changed
thee
into
wine
i
adjure
thee
that
thou
mayst
not
suffer
any
imp
or
phantom
to
abide
in
thy
substance
that
thou
mayst
be
indued
with
exorcising
power
and
become
a
source
of
salvation
so
that
when
thou
art
sprinkled
on
the
fruits
of
the
field
on
vines
on
trees
on
human
habitations
in
the
city
or
in
the
country
on
stables
or
on
flocks
or
if
any
one
may
touch
or
taste
thee
thou
shalt
become
a
remedy
and
a
relief
from
the
wiles
of
satan
that
through
thee
plagues
and
pestilence
may
be
driven
away
that
through
contact
with

weevils

caterpillars
locusts
and
moles
may
be
dispersed
and
the
maliciousness
of
all
visible
and
invisible
powers
hostile
to
man
may
be
brought
to
in
the
prayers
which
follow
the
water
is
entreated
to
preserve
the
fruits
of
the
earth
from
insects
mice
moles
serpents
and
other
foul
this
subject
was
treated
in
a
lively
and
entertaining
manner
by
a
jesuit
priest
père
bougeant
in
a
book
entitled
philosophique
sur
le
langage
des
which
was
written
in
the
form
of
a
letter
addressed
to
a
lady
and
published
at
paris
in
in
the
first
place
the
author
refers
to
the
intelligence
shown
by
animals
and
refutes
the
cartesian
theory
that
they
are
mere
machines
or
animated
automata
this
tenet
we
may
add
was
not
original
with
descartes
but
was
set
forth
at
length
by
a
spanish
physician
gomez
pereira
in
a
bulky
latin
volume
bearing
the
queer
dedicatory
title
margarita
opus
nempe
physicis
medicis
ac
theologis
non
minus
utile
quam
and
printed
in
nearly
a
century
before
the
publication
of
descartes
de
prima
philosophia
and
principia
which
began
a
new
epoch
in
the
history
of
philosophy
if
animals
are
nothing
but
ingenious
pieces
of
mechanism
argues
the
jesuit
father
then
the
feelings
of
a
man
towards
his
dog
would
not
differ
from
those
which
he
entertains
towards
his
watch
and
they
would
both
inspire
him
with
the
same
kind
of
affection
but
such
is
not
the
case
even
the
strictest
cartesian
would
never
think
of
petting
his
chronometer
as
he
pets
his
poodle
or
would
expect
the
former
to
respond
to
his
caresses
as
the
latter
does
practically
he
subverts
his
own
metaphysical
system
by
the
distinction
which
he
makes
between
them
treating
one
as
a
machine
and
the
other
as
a
sentient
being
endowed
with
mental
powers
and
passions
corresponding
in
some
degree
to
those
which
he
himself
possesses
we
infer
from
our
own
individual
consciousness
that
other
persons
who
act
as
we
do
are
free
and
intelligent
agents
as
we
claim
to
be
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
lower
animals
whose
manifestations
of
joy
sorrow
hope
fear
desire
love
hatred
and
other
emotions
akin
to
those
passing
in
our
own
minds
prove
that
there
is
within
them
a
spiritual
principle
which
does
not
differ
essentially
from
the
human
soul
but
this
conclusion
he
adds
is
contrary
to
the
teachings
of
the
christian
religion
since
it
involves
the
immortality
of
animal
souls
and
necessitates
some
provision
for
their
reward
or
punishment
in
a
future
life
if
they
are
capable
of
merits
and
demerits
and
can
incur
praise
and
blame
then
they
are
worthy
of
retribution
hereafter
and
there
must
be
a
heaven
and
a
hell
prepared
for
them
so
that
the
of
a
man
over
a
beast
as
an
object
of
god
s
mercy
or
wrath
is
lost
beasts
in
that
case
would
be
a
species
of
man
or
men
a
species
of
beast
both
of
which
propositions
are
incompatible
with
the
teachings
of
the
only
means
of
reconciling
these
views
endowing
animals
with
intellectual
sense
and
immortal
souls
without
running
counter
to
christian
dogmas
is
to
assume
that
they
are
incarnations
of
evil
spirits
origen
held
that
the
scheme
of
redemption
embraced
also
satan
and
his
satellites
who
would
be
ultimately
converted
and
restored
to
their
primitive
estate
several
patristic
theologians
endorsed
this
notion
but
the
church
rejected
it
as
heretical
the
devils
are
therefore
from
the
standpoint
of
catholic
orthodoxy
irrevocably
damned
and
the
blood
of
christ
has
made
no
atonement
for
them
but
although
their
fate
is
sealed
their
torments
have
not
yet
begun
if
a
man
dies
in
his
sins
his
soul
as
soon
as
it
departs
from
his
body
receives
its
sentence
and
goes
straight
to
hell
the
highest
ecclesiastical
authorities
have
decided
that
this
is
not
true
of
devils
who
although
condemned
to
everlasting
fire
do
not
enter
upon
their
punishment
until
after
the
this
view
is
supported
by
many
passages
and
incidents
of
holy
writ
thus
christ
declares
that
when
the
son
of
man
shall
come
in
his
glory
he
shall
say
unto
them
on
his
left
hand
depart
from
me
ye
cursed
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
here
it
is
not
stated
that
the
devils
are
already
burning
but
that
the
fire
has
been
prepared
for
them
a
form
of
expression
which
leads
us
to
infer
that
they
were
not
yet
in
it
again
the
devils
which
christ
drove
out
of
the
two
exceeding
fierce
demoniacs
protested
against
such
interference
saying
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
time
this
question
has
no
significance
unless
we
suppose
that
they
had
a
right
to
inhabit
such
living
beings
as
had
been
assigned
to
them
until
the
time
of
their
torment
should
come
on
the
last
day
père
bougeant
is
furthermore
of
the
opinion
that
when
these
devils
were
sent
miraculously
and
therefore
abnormally
into
the
swine
they
came
into
conflict
with
the
devils
already
in
possession
of
the
pigs
and
thus
caused
the
whole
herd
to
run
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
sea
even
a
hog
he
thinks
could
not
stand
it
to
harbour
more
than
one
devil
at
a
time
and
would
be
driven
to
suicide
by
having
an
intrinsic
and
superfluous
demon
conjured
into
it
a
still
more
explicit
and
decisive
declaration
on
this
point
is
found
in
the
epistle
of
jude
and
the
second
epistle
of
peter
where
it
is
stated
that
the
angels
which
kept
not
their
first
estate
the
lord
hath
reserved
in
everlasting
chains
under
darkness
unto
the
judgment
of
the
great
day
these
words
are
to
be
understood
figuratively
as
referring
to
the
irrevocableness
of
their
doom
and
the
durance
vile
to
which
they
are
meanwhile
subjected
that
they
are
held
in
some
sort
of
temporary
custody
and
are
not
actually
undergoing
but
still
awaiting
the
punishment
which
divine
justice
has
imposed
upon
them
the
sacred
scriptures
and
the
teachings
of
the
church
leave
no
manner
of
doubt
now
the
question
arises
as
to
what
these
legions
of
devils
are
doing
in
the
meantime
some
of
them
are
engaged
in
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
walking
up
and
down
in
it
in
order
to
spy
out
and
take
advantage
of
human
infirmities
god
himself
makes
use
of
them
to
test
the
fealty
of
men
and
their
power
of
holding
fast
to
their
integrity
under
severe
temptations
just
as
the
creator
made
fossils
and
concealed
them
in
the
different
strata
of
the
earth
in
order
to
see
whether
christian
faith
in
the
truth
of
revelation
would
be
strong
enough
to
resist
the
seductions
of
science
falsely
so
other
devils
enter
into
living
human
bodies
and
give
themselves
up
to
evil
enchantments
as
wizards
and
witches
others
still
reanimate
corpses
or
assume
the
form
and
features
of
the
dead
and
wander
about
as
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
not
only
were
pagans
regarded
by
the
christian
church
as
and
exorcised
before
being
baptized
but
it
is
also
a
logical
deduction
from
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
that
a
devil
takes
possession
of
every
child
as
soon
as
it
is
born
and
remains
there
until
expelled
by
an
ecclesiastical
functionary
who
combines
the
office
of
priest
with
that
of
conjurer
and
is
especially
appointed
for
this
purpose
hence
arose
the
necessity
of
abrenunciation
as
it
was
called
which
preceded
baptism
in
the
catholic
church
and
which
luther
and
the
anglican
reformers
retained
before
the
candidate
was
christened
he
was
exorcised
and
adjured
personally
if
an
adult
or
through
a
sponsor
if
an
infant
to
forsake
the
devil
and
all
his
these
words
which
still
hold
a
place
in
the
ritual
but
are
now
repeated
in
a
perfunctory
manner
by
persons
who
have
no
conception
of
the
magic
potency
formerly
ascribed
to
them
are
a
survival
of
the
old
formula
of
exorcism
in
the
seventeenth
century
there
was
a
keen
competition
between
the
roman
catholic
and
the
lutheran
clergy
in
casting
out
devils
the
former
claiming
that
to
them
alone
had
been
transmitted
the
exorcising
power
conferred
by
christ
upon
his
apostles
the
protestant
churches
finally
gave
up
the
and
during
the
eighteenth
century
it
fell
into
general
discredit
and
disuse
among
them
although
some
of
the
stiffest
and
most
conservative
lutherans
never
really
abandoned
it
in
principle
and
have
recently
endeavoured
to
revive
it
in
practice
the
catholic
church
on
the
contrary
still
holds
that
men
women
and
cattle
may
be
possessed
by
devils
and
prescribes
the
means
of
their
expulsion
in
a
work
entitled
ecclesiasticum
ad
usum
clericorum
by
pater
franz
xaver
lohbauer
munich
there
is
a
chapter
on
the
mode
of
helping
those
who
are
afflicted
by
demons
juvandi
afflictos
a
the
author
maintains
that
nearly
all
nervous
diseases
hysteria
epilepsy
insanity
and
milder
forms
of
mental
alienation
are
either
the
direct
result
of
diabolical
agencies
or
attended
and
greatly
aggravated
by
them
a
sound
mind
in
a
sound
body
may
make
a
man
but
satan
is
quick
to
take
advantage
of
his
infirmities
in
order
to
get
possession
of
his
person
the
adversary
is
constantly
lying
in
wait
watching
for
and
trying
to
produce
physical
derangements
as
breaches
in
the
wall
through
which
he
may
rush
in
and
capture
the
citadel
of
the
soul
in
all
cases
of
this
sort
the
priest
is
to
be
called
in
with
the
physician
and
the
medicines
are
to
be
blessed
and
sprinkled
with
holy
water
before
being
administered
exorcisms
and
conjurations
are
not
only
to
be
spoken
over
the
patient
but
also
to
be
written
on
slips
of
consecrated
paper
and
applied
like
a
plaster
to
the
parts
especially
affected
the
physician
should
keep
himself
supplied
with
these
written
exorcisms
to
be
used
when
it
is
impossible
for
a
priest
to
be
present
as
with
patent
medicines
the
public
is
warned
against
counterfeits
and
no
exorcism
is
genuine
unless
it
is
stamped
with
the
seal
and
bears
the
signature
of
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
according
to
father
lohbauer
the
demon
is
the
efficient
cause
of
the
malady
and
there
can
be
no
cure
until
the
evil
one
is
cast
out
this
is
the
office
of
the
priest
the
physician
then
heals
the
physical
disorder
repairing
the
damage
done
to
the
body
and
as
it
were
stopping
the
gaps
with
his
drugs
so
as
to
prevent
the
demon
from
getting
in
again
thus
science
and
religion
are
reconciled
and
work
together
harmoniously
for
the
healing
of
mankind
the
catholic
church
has
a
general
form
of
a
daemone
for
the
relief
of
those
vexed
by
demons
and
pope
leo
who
was
justly
esteemed
as
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
and
more
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
modern
spirit
than
any
of
his
predecessors
composed
and
issued
november
a
formula
of
in
satanam
et
angelos
worthy
of
a
place
in
any
mediæval
collection
of
conjurations
his
holiness
never
failed
to
repeat
this
exorcism
in
his
daily
prayers
and
commended
it
to
the
bishops
and
other
clergy
as
a
potent
means
of
warding
off
the
assaults
of
satan
and
of
casting
out
devils
in
the
bishop
of
passau
published
a
and
as
late
as
theobald
bischofberger
described
and
defended
the
practice
of
the
papal
see
in
this
respect
in
a
brochure
printed
in
stuttgart
and
entitled
verwaltung
des
exorcistats
nach
massgabe
der
römischen
that
these
formulas
are
still
deemed
highly
efficacious
is
evident
from
the
many
recent
cases
in
which
they
have
been
employed
thus
in
a
devil
named
took
possession
of
a
maiden
of
angelic
beauty
in
luxemburg
and
was
cast
out
by
bishop
laurentius
this
demon
claimed
to
be
one
of
the
archangels
expelled
from
heaven
and
appears
to
have
rivalled
parson
stöcker
and
rector
ahlwardt
in
animosity
when
the
name
of
jesus
was
mentioned
he
cried
out
derisively
o
that
jew
didn
t
he
have
to
drink
gall
when
commanded
to
depart
he
begged
that
he
might
go
into
some
jew
the
bishop
however
refused
to
give
him
leave
and
bade
him
go
to
hell
which
he
forthwith
did
moaning
as
he
went
in
melancholy
tones
that
seemed
to
issue
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
burning
burning
everlastingly
burning
in
hell
the
voice
was
so
sad
adds
the
bishop
that
we
should
have
wept
for
sheer
compassion
had
we
not
known
that
it
was
the
again
a
lay
brother
connected
with
an
educational
institute
in
rome
became
diabolically
possessed
on
january
and
was
exorcised
by
father
jordan
in
this
instance
the
leading
spirit
was
lucifer
himself
attended
by
a
host
of
satellites
of
whom
lignifex
latibor
monitor
ritu
sefilie
shulium
haijunikel
exaltor
and
reromfex
were
the
most
important
it
took
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
cast
out
these
demons
the
first
time
but
they
renewed
their
assaults
on
february
and
and
were
not
completely
discomfited
and
driven
back
into
the
infernal
regions
until
february
and
then
only
by
using
the
water
of
lourdes
which
as
father
jordan
states
acted
upon
them
like
poison
causing
them
to
writhe
to
and
fro
lucifer
was
especially
rude
and
saucy

for
example
when
father
jordan
said
every
knee
in

and
on

earth
shall
bow
to
the
name

the

never
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
authentic
reports
of
things
of
this
sort
that
have
happened
within
the
memory
of
the
present
generation
such
as
the
exorcism
of
a
woman
of
at
laas
in
the
tyrol
in
the
spring
of
and
the
expulsion
of
an
evil
spirit
from
a
boy
ten
years
of
age
at
wemding
in
bavaria
by
a
capuchin
father
aurelian
july
and
with
the
sanction
of
the
bishops
of
augsburg
and
eichstätt
in
the
latter
case
we
have
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
affair
by
the
exorcist
himself
who
in
conclusion
uses
the
following
strong
language
whosoever
denies
demoniacal
possession
in
our
days
confesses
thereby
that
he
has
gone
astray
from
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
church
but
he
will
believe
in
it
when
he
himself
is
in
the
possession
of
the
devil
in
hell
as
for
myself
i
have
the
authority
of
two
in
a
pamphlet
on
this
subject
printed
at
munich
in
and
entitled
teufelsaustreibung
in
the
author
richard
treufels
takes
the
same
view
declaring
that
diabolical
possession
is
an
incontestable
fact
confirmed
by
the
traditions
of
all
nations
of
ancient
and
modern
times
by
the
unequivocal
testimony
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
by
the
teaching
and
practice
of
the
catholic
christ
he
says
gave
his
disciples
power
and
authority
over
all
devils
to
cast
them
out
and
the
same
power
is
divinely
conferred
upon
every
priest
by
his
consecration
although
it
is
never
to
be
exercised
without
the
permission
of
his
bishop
doubtless
modern
science
by
investigating
the
laws
and
forces
of
nature
is
gradually
diminishing
the
realm
of
superstition
but
there
are
vast
plains
of
humanity
that
have
not
yet
felt
its
enlightening
and
elevating
influence
it
has
been
estimated
that
of
the
rural
population
of
europe
and
hundredths
of
the
peasantry
living
in
the
vicinity
of
a
cloister
and
darkened
by
its
shadow
believe
in
the
reality
of
diabolical
possession
and
attribute
most
maladies
of
men
and
murrain
in
cattle
to
the
direct
agency
of
satan
putting
their
faith
in
the
metaphysical
aid
of
the
conjurer
rather
than
in
medical
advice
and
veterinary
skill
unfortunately
this
belief
is
not
confined
to
catholics
and
boors
but
is
held
by
protestants
who
are
considered
persons
of
education
and
superior
culture
lyman
abbott
asserted
in
a
sermon
preached
in
plymouth
church
that
what
we
call
the
impulses
of
our
lower
nature
are
the
whispered
suggestions
of
natures
watching
for
our
fall
and
exultant
if
they
can
accomplish
but
while
affirming
that
evil
spirits
exercise
an
influence
over
mankind
and
that
cranks
like
guiteau
the
assassin
of
president
garfield
are
diabolically
possessed
the
reverend
divine
would
hardly
risk
his
reputation
for
sanity
by
attempting
to
exorcise
the
supposed
demon
the
catholic
priest
holds
the
same
view
but
has
the
courage
of
his
convictions
and
goes
solemnly
to
work
with
bell
book
and
candle
to
effect
the
expulsion
of
the
indwelling
fiend
the
fact
that
such
methods
of
healing
are
sometimes
successful
is
adduced
as
conclusive
proof
of
their
miraculous
character
but
this
inference
is
wholly
incorrect
professor
hoppe
in
an
essay
on
und
geisterglaube
und
die
psychologische
erklärung
des
zeitschrift

lv
gives
a
psychological
explanation
of
these
puzzling
phenomena
the
priest
he
says
exerts
a
salutary
influence
upon
the
brain
through
the
respect
and
dignity
which
he
inspires
just
as
christ
in
his
day
wrought
upon
those
who
were
sick
and
possessed
with
indeed
it
is
expressly
stated
by
the
evangelist
that
jesus
did
not
attempt
to
do
wonderful
works
among
people
who
did
not
believe
according
to
this
theory
the
exorcism
effects
a
cure
by
its
powerful
action
on
the
imagination
just
as
there
are
frequent
ailments
for
which
a
wise
physician
administers
bread
pills
and
a
weak
solution
of
powdered
sugar
as
the
safest
and
best
medicaments
professor
hoppe
therefore
approves
of
priestly
conjurations
for
the
expulsion
of
devils
as
a
psychical
means
of
healing
and
thinks
that
the
more
ceremoniously
the
rite
can
be
performed
in
the
presence
of
grave
and
venerable
witnesses
the
more
effective
it
will
be
this
opinion
is
endorsed
by
a
catholic
priest
friedrich
jaskowski
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
trierer
rock
und
seine
patienten
vom
jahre
saarbrücken
carl
schmidtke
the
author
belongs
to
the
diocese
of
trier
and
is
therefore
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bishop
felix
korum
whose
statements
concerning
the
miracles
wrought
and
the
evidences
of
divine
mercy
manifested
during
the
exhibition
of
the
holy
coat
in
he
courageously
reviews
and
conclusively
refutes
the
bishop
had
printed
what
he
called
documentary
proofs
consisting
of
certificates
issued
by
obscure
curates
and
country
doctors
that
certain
persons
suffering
chiefly
from
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
had
been
healed
and
sought
to
discover
in
these
cures
the
working
of
divine
agencies
jaskowski
shows
that
in
several
instances
the
persons
said
to
have
found
relief
died
shortly
afterwards
and
maintains
that
where
cures
actually
occurred
they
were
not
due
to
a
miracle
or
any
direct
interference
of
god
with
the
established
order
of
things
but
happened
in
a
purely
natural
he
quotes
the
late
professor
charcot
forel
and
other
neuropathologists
to
establish
the
fact
that
emanating
from
a
physician
or
priest
or
originating
in
the
person
s
own
mind
may
often
be
the
most
effective
remedy
for
neurotic
disorders
of
every
kind
in
the
patient
is
possessed
with
the
fixed
idea
that
the
doing
of
a
certain
thing
which
may
be
in
itself
absolutely
indifferent
will
afford
relief
as
an
example
of
this
jaskowski
refers
to
the
woman
who
was
diseased
with
an
issue
of
blood
and
approaching
jesus
said
within
herself
if
i
may
but
touch
his
garment
i
shall
be
this
is
precisely
the
position
taken
by
jesus
himself
who
turned
to
the
woman
and
said
daughter
be
of
good
comfort
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
jaskowski
also
quotes
the
declaration
of
the
evangelist
referred
to
above
that
in
a
certain
place
the
people
s
lack
of
faith
prevented
jesus
from
doing
many
wondrous
works
and
does
not
deny
that
on
this
principle
which
is
now
recognized
by
the
most
eminent
physicians
some
few
of
the
hundreds
of
pilgrims
may
have
been
restored
to
health
by
touching
the
holy
coat
of
trier
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
popular
belief
in
bishop
korum
s
assertion
that
it
is
the
same
garment
which
jesus
wore
and
the
woman
touched
would
greatly
increase
its
healing
efficacy
through
the
force
of
see
my
article
on
recent
recrudescence
of
superstition
in
appleton
s
science
for
pp
the
bishop
of
bamberg
in
bavaria
has
been
stigmatized
as
a
hypocrite
because
he
sends
the
infirm
of
his
flock
on
a
pilgrimage
to
lourdes
or
laas
or
some
other
holy
shrine
while
he
prefers
for
himself
the
profane
waters
of
karlsbad
or
kissingen
but
in
so
doing
he
is
not
guilty
of
any
inconsistency
since
a
journey
to
sacred
places
and
contact
with
sacred
relics
would
not
act
upon
him
with
the
same
force
as
upon
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
masses
of
his
diocese
his
conduct
only
evinces
his
disbelief
in
the
supernatural
character
of
the
remedies
he
prescribes
the
distinguished
french
physician
professor
charcot
as
already
mentioned
recognized
the
curative
power
of
faith
under
certain
circumstances
and
occasionally
found
it
eminently
successful
in
hysterical
and
other
purely
nervous
affections
in
some
cases
he
did
not
hesitate
to
prescribe
a
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
any
saint
for
whom
the
patient
may
have
had
a
peculiar
reverence
but
in
no
instance
in
his
experience
did
faith
or
exorcism
or
hagiolatry
heal
an
organic
disease
set
a
dislocated
joint
or
restore
an
amputated
limb
what
falstaff
says
of
honour
is
equally
true
of
faith
it
hath
no
skill
in
but
to
return
from
this
digression
père
bougeant
s
theory
of
the
diabolical
possession
of
pagans
and
unbaptized
persons
would
provide
for
comparatively
few
devils
and
the
gradual
diffusion
of
christianity
would
constantly
diminish
the
supply
of
human
beings
available
as
their
proper
habitations
the
ultimate
conversion
of
the
whole
world
and
the
custom
of
baptizing
infants
as
soon
as
they
are
born
would
therefore
produce
serious
domiciliary
destitution
and
distress
among
the
evil
spirits
and
set
immense
numbers
of
them
hopelessly
adrift
as
vagabonds
and
thus
create
an
extremely
undesirable
diabolical
proletariat
this
difficulty
is
avoided
by
assuming
that
the
vast
majority
of
devils
are
incarnate
in
the
billions
of
beasts
of
all
kinds
which
dwell
upon
the
earth
or
fly
in
the
air
or
fill
the
waters
of
the
rivers
and
the
seas
this
hypothesis
he
adds
enables
me
to
ascribe
to
the
lower
animals
thought
knowledge
feeling
and
a
spiritual
principle
or
soul
without
running
counter
to
the
truths
of
religion
indeed
so
far
from
being
astonished
at
their
manifestations
of
intelligence
foresight
memory
and
reason
i
am
rather
surprised
that
they
do
not
display
these
qualities
in
a
higher
degree
since
their
soul
is
probably
far
more
perfect
than
ours
their
defects
are
as
i
have
discovered
owing
to
the
fact
that
in
brute
as
in
us
the
mind
works
through
material
organs
and
inasmuch
as
these
organs
are
grosser
and
less
perfect
in
the
lower
animals
than
in
man
it
follows
that
their
exhibitions
of
intelligence
their
thoughts
and
all
their
mental
operations
must
be
less
perfect
and
if
these
proud
spirits
are
conscious
of
their
condition
how
humiliating
it
must
be
for
them
to
see
themselves
thus
embruted
whether
they
are
conscious
of
it
or
not
this
deep
degradation
is
the
first
act
of
god
s
vengeance
executed
on
his
foes
it
is
a
foretaste
of
only
by
such
an
assumption
as
our
author
proceeds
to
show
is
it
possible
to
justify
the
ways
of
man
to
the
lower
animals
and
to
reconcile
his
cruel
treatment
of
them
with
the
goodness
of
an
and
maker
and
ruler
of
the
universe
for
this
reason
he
goes
on
to
explain
the
christian
church
has
never
deemed
it
a
duty
to
take
the
lower
animals
under
its
protection
or
to
inculcate
ordinary
natural
kindness
towards
them
hence
in
countries
like
italy
and
spain
where
the
influence
of
catholicism
has
been
supreme
for
centuries
not
only
are
wild
birds
and
beasts
of
chase
relentlessly
slaughtered
and
exterminated
but
even
useful
domestic
animals
asses
and
are
subjected
to
a
supererogation
of
suffering
at
the
hands
of
ruthless
man
as
the
pious
parsi
conscientiously
comes
up
to
the
help
of
ahuramazda
against
the
malevolent
by
killing
as
many
as
possible
of
the
creatures
which
the
latter
has
made
so
the
good
catholic
becomes
an
efficient
with
god
by
maltreating
brutes
and
thus
aiding
the
almighty
in
punishing
the
devils
of
which
they
are
the
visible
and
bruisable
forms
whatever
pain
is
inflicted
is
felt
not
by
the
physical
organism
but
by
the
animated
spirit
it
is
the
embodied
demon
that
really
suffers
howling
in
the
beaten
dog
and
squealing
in
the
butchered
pig
there
are
doubtless
many
persons
of
tender
susceptibilities
who
can
not
bear
to
think
that
the
animals
whose
daily
companionship
we
enjoy
the
parrot
we
feed
with
sugar
the
pretty
pug
we
caress
and
the
noble
horse
which
ministers
to
our
comfort
and
convenience
are
nothing
but
devils
predestined
to
everlasting
torture
but
these
purely
sentimental
considerations
are
of
no
weight
in
the
scale
of
reason
what
matters
it
replies
the
jesuit
father
whether
it
is
a
devil
or
another
kind
of
creature
that
is
in
our
service
or
contributes
to
our
amusement
for
my
part
this
idea
pleases
rather
than
repels
me
and
i
recognize
with
gratitude
the
beneficence
of
the
creator
in
having
provided
me
with
so
many
little
devils
for
my
use
and
entertainment
if
it
be
said
that
these
poor
creatures
which
we
have
learned
to
love
and
so
fondly
cherish
are
to
eternal
torments
i
can
only
adore
the
decrees
of
god
but
do
not
hold
myself
responsible
for
the
terrible
sentence
i
leave
the
execution
of
the
dread
decision
to
the
sovereign
judge
and
continue
to
live
with
my
little
devils
as
i
live
pleasantly
with
a
multitude
of
persons
of
whom
according
to
the
teachings
of
our
holy
religion
the
great
majority
will
be

to
accept
the
poodle
in
its
phenomenal
form
and
to
make
the
most
of
it
without
troubling
himself
about
des
pudels
this
doctrine
he
thinks
is
amply
illustrated
and
confirmed
by
an
appeal
to
the
consentient
opinion
of
mankind
or
the
argument
from
universal
belief
which
has
been
so
often
and
so
effectively
urged
in
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
if
the
maxim
non
has
the
same
validity
in
the
province
of
philosophy
as
in
that
of
law
then
we
are
justified
in
assuming
that
the
whole
human
race
can
not
go
wrong
even
in
purely
metaphysical
speculation
and
that
unanimity
in
error

a
psychological
impossibility

criterion
of
truth

by
which
the
roman
hierarchy
is
willing
to
have
its
claims
to
ecclesiastical
catholicity

doctrinal
orthodoxy
tested
is
confined
to
christendom
in
its
application
and
does
not
consider
the
views
of
persons
outside
of
the
body
of
believers
in
the
question
under
discussion
the
argument
is
not
subject
to
such
limitations
but
gathers
testimony
from
all
races
and
religions
showing
that
there
is
not
a
civilized
nation
or
savage
tribe
on
the
face
of
the
earth
which
does
not
regard
or
has

as

of
evil
spirits
and
sought
to
propitiate
them
that
the
devil

an
ass
is
a
truth
so
palpable
that
it
has
passed
into
a
proverb

the
christian
satan
betrays
his
presence
by
the
cloven

so
that

as

a

have
made

as
small

it
is
therefore
no
more
difficult
to
believe
that

in

take

their
temporary
abode
is
a
thing
of
no
consequence
in
fact
devils
in
the
forms
of
gnats
and
tiny
insects
were
thought
to
be
especially
dangerous
since
one
might
swallow
them
unawares
and
thus
become
diabolically

a
fly
while
drinking
beer
the
evil
spirit
incarnate
in
the
fly
took
possession
of
the
maiden
and
began
to
speak
out
of
her
thus
attracting
crowds
of
people
who
put
questions
to
the
devil
and
tried
to
drive
him
out
by
prayers
in
which
the
unhappy
girl
sometimes
joined
greatly
to
her
discomfort
since
the
devil
waxed
exceeding
wroth
and
unruly
and
caused
her
much
suffering
whenever
she
uttered
the
name
of
christ
finally
the
parish
priest
had
her
brought
into
the
church
where
he
succeeded
with
considerable
difficulty
in
exorcising
her
the
stubborn
demon
resisted
for
two
years
all
efforts
to
cast
him
out
he
even
tried
to
compromise
with
the
girl
promising
to
be
content
with
a
finger
nail
or
a
single
hair
of
her
head
but
she
declined
all
overtures
and
he
was
at
last
expelled
by
means
of
a
potent
conjuration
which
lasted
from
midnight
till
midday
as
the
human
soul
is
released
by
death
so
the
extinction
of
life
in
any
animal
sets
its
devil
free
who
instead
of
entering
upon
a
spiritual
state
of
existence
goes
into
the
egg
or
embryo
of
another
animal
and
resumes
his
penal
bondage
to
the
flesh
thus
a
devil
after
having
been
a
cat
or
a
goat
may
pass
not
by
choice
but
by
constraint
into
the
embryo
of
a
bird
a
fish
or
a
butterfly
happy
are
those
who
make
a
lucky
hit
and
become
household
pets
instead
of
beasts
of
burden
or
of
slaughter
the
lottery
of
destiny
bars
them
the
right
of
voluntary
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
continues
our
author
which
pythagoras
taught
of
yore
and
some
indian
sages
hold
is
untenable
in
its
application
to
men
and
contrary
to
religion
but
it
fits
admirably
into
the
system
already
set
forth
concerning
the
nature
of
beasts
and
shocks
neither
our
faith
nor
our
furthermore
it
explains
why
all
species
of
animals
produce
many
more
eggs
or
embryos
than
are
necessary
to
propagate
their
kind
and
to
provide
for
a
normal
of
the
millions
of
germs
of
which
great
creating
nature
is
so
prolific
comparatively
few
ever
develop
into
living
creatures
only
those
which
are
vivified
by
a
devil
are
evolved
into
complete
organisms
the
others
perish
this
seeming
superfluity
and
waste
can
be
most
easily
reconciled
with
the
careful
economy
and
wise
frugality
of
nature
by
viewing
it
as
a
manifestation
of
the
bountiful
and
beneficent
providence
of
god
in
preventing
any
lack
of
occupation
or
abode
on
the
part
of
the
devils
which
are
being
constantly
disembodied
and
this
accounts
for
the
prodigious
clouds
of
locusts
and
countless
hosts
of
caterpillars
which
suddenly
desolate
our
fields
and
gardens
the
cause
of
these
astonishing
multiplications
has
been
sought
in
cold
heat
rain
and
wind
but
the
real
reason
is
that
at
the
time
of
their
appearance
extraordinary
quantities
of
animals
have
died
or
their
embryos
been
destroyed
so
that
the
devils
that
animated
them
were
compelled
to
avail
themselves
at
once
of
whatever
species
they
found
most
ready
to
receive
them
which
would
naturally
be
the
superabundant
eggs
of

more
profoundly
this
subject
is
investigated
he
concludes
and
the
more
light
our
observations
and
researches
throw
upon
it
from
all
sides
the
more
probable
does
the
hypothesis
here
suggested
in
explanation
of
the
puzzling
phenomena
of
animal
life
and
intelligence
appear
father
bougeant
calls
his
lucubration
a
new
system
of
philosophy
but
this
is
not
strictly
true
he
has
only
given
a
fuller
and
more
facetious
exposition
of
a
doctrine
taught
by
many
of
the
greatest
lights
of
the
catholic
church
among
others
by
thomas
aquinas
whose
authority
as
a
thinker
pope
leo
xiii
distinctly
recognized
and
earnestly
sought
to
restore
to
its
former
prestige
bougeant
s
ingenious
dissertation
has
a
vein
of
irony
or
at
least
a
strain
of
jocundity
in
it
approaching
at
times
so
perilously
near
the
fatal
brink
of
persiflage
that
one
can
not
help
surmising
an
intention
to
render
the
whole
thing
ridiculous
in
a
witty
and
underhand
way
eminently
compatible
with
jesuitical
habits
of
mind
but
whether
serious
or
satirical
his
treatise
is
an
excellent
example
and
illustration
of
the
kind
of
dialectic
and
syllogistic
rubbish
which
passed
for
reasoning
in
the
early
and
middle
ages
of
the
christian
era
and
which
the
greatest
scholars
and
acutest
intellects
of
those
days
fondly
indulged
in
and
seem
to
have
been
fully
satisfied
with
here
too
we
come
upon
the
metaphysical
and
theological
groundwork
upon
which
was
reared
by
a
strictly
logical
process
a
vast
superstructure
of
ecclesiastical
excommunication
and
criminal
prosecution
against
bugs
and
beasts
he
protests
with
and
needless
iteration
his
absolute
devotion
to
the
precepts
of
religion
indeed
like
the
lady
in
the
play
he
protests
too
much
in
all
humbleness
and
submission
he
bows
to
the
authority
of
the
church
and
would
not
touch
the
ark
of
the
covenant
even
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
but
his
easy
acquiescence
has
an
air
of
perfunctoriness
and
in
his
assenting
lips
there
lurks
a
secret
leer
which
casts
suspicion
on
his
words
and
looks
like
poking
fun
at
the
principles
he
professes
and
turning
them
into
raillery
indeed
such
covert
derision
would
have
been
a
suitable
way
of
ridiculing
the
gross
popular
superstition
of
his
time
which
saw
a
diabolical
incarnation
in
every
unfamiliar
form
of
animal
life
during
the
latter
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
swiss
naturalist
named
thurneysser
who
held
the
position
of
physician
in
ordinary
to
the
elector
johann
georg
von
brandenburg
kept
some
scorpions
bottled
in
olive
oil
which
were
feared
by
the
common
people
as
terrible
devils
endowed
with
magic
power
thurneysser
presented
also
to
basel
his
native
city
a
large
elk
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
prince
radziwil
but
the
good
baselers
looked
upon
the
strange
animal
as
a
most
dangerous
demon
and
a
pious
old
woman

a
distinguished
spanish
theologian
of
the
sixteenth
century
martin
azpilcueta
commonly
known
as
navarre
refers
in
his
work
on
excommunication
to
a
case
in
which
anathemas
were
fulminated
against
certain
large
called
terones
which
infested
the
waters
of
sorrento
and
destroyed
the
nets
of
the
fishermen
he
speaks
of
them
as
fish
or
cacodemons
seu
and
maintains
that
they
are
subject
to
anathematization
not
as
fish
but
only
as
devils
in
his
five
counsels
and
other
tractates
on
this
subject
opera
lyons
reprinted
at
venice
and
at
cologne
he
often
takes
issue
with
chassenée
on
minor
points
but
the
french
jurist
and
the
spanish
divine
agree
on
the
main
question
in
this
connection
it
may
be
a
matter
of
interest
to
add
that
a
german
neuropathologist
of
our
own
day
herr
von
bodelschwingh
ascribes
epilepsy
to
what
he
calls
demonic
infection
due
to
the
presence
of
the
in
the
blood
of
those
who
are
subject
to
this
disease
the
microbe
to
which
the
jocose
scientist
has
been
pleased
to
give
this
name
differs
from
all
other
bacilli
hitherto
discovered
in
having
two
horns
and
a
tail
although
the
most
powerful
lenses
have
not
yet
revealed
any
traces
of
a
cloven
foot
an
additional
indication
of
its
infernal
qualities
is
the
fact
that
it
liquefies
the
gelatine
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
and
turns
it
black
emitting
at
the
same
time
a
pestilential
stench
doubtless
this
discovery
will
be
hailed
by
theologians
as
a
striking
confirmation
of
divine
revelation
by
modern
science
proving
that
our
forefathers
were
right
in
attributing
the
to
diabolical
agencies
we
know
now
that
it
was
a
legion
of
which
went
out
of
the
man
into
the
gadarene
swine
and
drove
them
tumultuously
over
a
precipice
into
the
sea
in
fact
who
can
tell
what
microbes
really
are
père
bougeant
would
certainly
have
regarded
them
as
nothing
less
than
microscopic
devils
the
savoyan
jurist
gaspard
bailly
in
the
second
part
of
the
disquisition
entitled
des
already
mentioned
treats
of
the
excellence
of
monitories
and
discusses
the
main
points
touching
the
criminal
prosecution
and
punishment
of
insects
he
begins
by
saying
that
one
should
not
contemn
monitories
a
general
term
for
anathemas
bans
and
excommunications
seeing
that
they
are
matters
of
great
importance
inasmuch
as
they
bear
with
them
the
deadliest
sword
wielded
by
our
holy
mother
the
church
to
wit
the
power
of
excommunication
which
cutteth
the
dry
wood
and
the
green
sparing
neither
the
quick
nor
the
dead
and
smiting
not
only
rational
beings
but
turning
its
edge
also
against
irrational
creatures
since
it
hath
been
shown
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
places
that
worms
and
insects
which
were
devouring
the
fruits
of
the
earth
have
been
excommunicated
and
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
church
have
withdrawn
from
the
cultivated
fields
to
the
places
prescribed
by
the
bishop
who
had
been
appointed
to
adjudge
and
to
adjure
bailly
then
cites
numerous
instances
of
this
kind
in
which
a
writer
on
logic
would
find
ample
illustrations
of
the
fallacy
known
as
hoc
ergo
propter
thus
in
the
latter
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
during
the
reign
of
charles
the
bold
duke
of
burgundy
a
plague
of
locusts
threatened
the
province
of
mantua
in
northern
italy
with
famine
but
were
dispersed
by
excommunication
he
quotes
some
florid
lines
from
the
poet
altiat
descriptive
of
these
devastating
swarms
which
came
after
so
many
other
woes
under
the
leadership
of
eurus
brought
by
the
east
wind
more
destructive
than
the
hordes
of
attila
or
the
camps
of
corsicans
devouring
the
hay
the
millet
and
the
corn
and
leaving
only
vain
wishes
where
the
hopes
of
august
again
in
a
cloud
of
locusts
fell
upon
lombardy
and
by
destroying
the
crops
caused
many
persons
to
perish
with
hunger
these
insects
were
as
long
as
a
man
s
finger
with
large
heads
and
bellies
filled
with
vileness
and
when
dead
they
infected
the
air
and
gave
forth
a
stench
which
even
carrion
kites
and
carnivorous
beasts
could
not
another
instance
is
given
in
which
swarms
of
insects
came
from
tartary
identified
in
the
popular
mind
with
tartarus
obscuring
the
sun
in
their
flight
and
covering
the
plains
of
poland
a
cubit
deep
in
the
year
on
bartholomew
s
day
these
creatures
began
to
devastate
the
region
round
botzen
in
the
tyrol
consuming
the
crops
and
laying
eggs
and
leaving
a
numerous
progeny
which
seemed
destined
to
continue
the
work
of
destruction
indefinitely
a
prosecution
was
therefore
instituted
against
them
before
the
ecclesiastical
court
at
kaltern
a
large
about
ten
miles
south
of
botzen
then
as
now
famous
for
its
wines
and
the
parish
priest
instructed
to
proceed
against
them
with
the
sentence
of
excommunication
in
accordance
with
the
verdict
of
the
tribunal
this
he
did
by
the
solemn
ceremony
of
inch
of
candle
and
anathematized
them
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
trinity
father
son
and
holy
owing
to
the
sins
of
the
people
and
their
remissness
in
the
matter
of
tithes
the
devouring
insects
resisted
for
a
time
the
power
of
the
church
but
finally
disappeared
under
the
reign
of
lotharius
early
in
the
twelfth
century
enormous
quantities
of
locusts
having
six
wings
with
two
teeth
harder
than
flint
and
darkening
the
sky
and
whitening
the
air
like
a
snowstorm
laid
waste
the
most
fertile
provinces
of
france
many
of
them
perished
in
the
rivers
and
the
sea
and
being
washed
ashore
sent
forth
a
putrescent
smell
and
produced
a
fearful
pestilence
precisely
the
same
phenomenon
with
like
disastrous
results
is
described
by
augustine
in
the
last
book
of
civitate
as
having
occurred
in
africa
and
caused
the
death
of
persons
in
the
majority
of
cases
adduced
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
church
intervened
at
all
with
its
fulminations
and
even
when
the
anathema
was
pronounced
the
insects
appear
to
have
departed
of
their
own
after
having
eaten
up
every
green
thing
and
reduced
the
inhabitants
to
the
verge
of
starvation
and
yet
bailly
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
judicial
mind
disciplined
by
study
accustomed
to
reason
and
to
know
what
sound
reasoning
is
goes
on
giving
accounts
of
such
scourges
as
though
they
proved
in
some
mysterious
way
the
effectiveness
of
ecclesiastical
excommunications
and
formed
a
cumulative
argument
in
support
of
such
claims
the
most
important
portion
of
bailly
s
work
is
that
in
which
he
shows
how
actions
of
this
kind
should
be
brought
and
conducted
with
specimens
of
plaints
pleas
replications
rejoinders
and
decisions
first
in
order
comes
the
petition
of
the
inhabitants
seeking
redress
des
which
is
followed
in
regular
succession
by
the
declaration
or
plea
of
the
inhabitants

the
defensive

or

for
the
insects

replication

the

the
ecclesiastical

which
is
solemnly
pronounced
in
latin
the
pleadings
on
both
sides
are
delivered
in
french
and
richly
interlarded
with
classical
allusions
and
latin
quotations
being
even
more
heavily
weighted
with
the
spoils
of
erudition
than
the
set
speech
of
a
member
of
the
british
parliament
the
following
abridgment
of
the
plea
in
which
the
prosecuting
attorney
sets
forth
the
cause
of
complaint
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
forensic
eloquence
displayed
on
such
occasions
gentlemen
these
poor
people
on
their
knees

with
tearful
eyes
appeal
to
your
sense
of
justice
as
the

praying
him
for

of
soldiers
to
exterminate
the
rabbits
which
were
burrowing
in
their
fields
and
consuming
their
crops
in
the
power
of
excommunication
you
have
a
weapon
more
effective
than
any
wielded
by
that
emperor
to
save
these
poor
suppliants
from
impending
famine
produced
by
the
ravages
of
little
beasts
which
spare
neither
the
corn
nor
the

ravages
like
those
of

that
laid

of

foxes

to

which
destroyed
the

and
assailed
even
the

themselves
you
know
how
great
are
the
evils
which
famine
brings
with
it
and
you
have
too
much
kindness
and
compassion
to
permit
my

to
be

discourses
at

examination

therefore

to
adjudicate
upon
the
case
in

with
the
facts
stated
in
the

from
continuing

devastations
ordering

to
quit
the
aforesaid
fields

to

spouting
of
an
ignorant
bumpkin
in
the
of
an
american
ever
produced
such
a
rhetorical
hotchpotch
of
matter
and
impertinency
mixed
as
the
earnest
plea
of
which
the
above
is
a
brief
abstract
rather
more
to
the
point
but
equally
overburdened
with
legal
lore
and
literary
pedantry
is
the
rejoinder
of
the
counsel
for
the
insects
gentlemen
inasmuch
as
you
have
chosen
me
to
defend
these
little
beasts
i
shall
an
it
please
you
endeavour
to
right
them
and
to
show
that
the
manner
of
proceeding
against
them
is
invalid
and
void
i
confess
that
i
am
greatly
astonished
at
the
treatment
they
have
been
subjected
to
and
at
the
charges
brought
against
them
as
though
they
had
committed
some
crime
thus
information
has
been
procured
touching
the
damage
said
to
have
been
done
by
them
they
have
been
summoned
to
appear
before
this
court
to
answer
for
their
conduct
and
since
they
are
notoriously
dumb
the
judge
wishing
that
they
should
not
suffer
wrong
on
account
of
this
defect
has
appointed
an
advocate
to
speak
in
their
behalf
and
to
set
forth
in
conformity
with
right
and
justice
the
reasons
which
they
themselves
are
unable
to
allege
since
you
have
permitted
me
to
appear
in
defence
of
these
poor
animals
i
will
state
in
the
first
place
that
the
summons
served
on
them
is
null
and
void
having
been
issued
against
beasts
which
can
not
and
ought
not
to
be
cited
before
this
judgment
seat
inasmuch
as
such
a
procedure
implies
that
the
parties
summoned
are
endowed
with
reason
and
volition
and
are
therefore
capable
of
committing
crime
that
this
is
not
the
case
with
these
creatures
is
clear
from
the
paragraph
in
the
first
book
of
the
pandects
where
we
find
these
words
enim
potest
animal
injuriam
fecisse
quod
sensu
the
second
ground
on
which
i
base
the
defence
of
my
clients
is
that
no
one
can
be
judicially
summoned
without
cause
and
whoever
has
had
such
a
summons
served
renders
himself
liable
to
the
penalty
prescribed
by
the
statute
poen
tem
as
regards
these
animals
there
is
no
justa
they
are
not
bound
in
any
manner
tenentur
ex
being
incompetent
to
make
contracts
or
to
enter
into
any
compact
or
covenant
whatsoever
ex
quasi
ex
ex
and
still
less
delicto
seu
can
there
be
any
question
of
a
delict
or
any
semblance
thereof
since
as
has
just
been
shown
the
rational
faculties
essential
to
the
capability
of
committing
criminal
actions
are
wanting
furthermore
it
is
illicit
to
do
that
which
is
nugatory
and
of
ne
porte
in
this
respect
justice
is
like
nature
which
as
the
philosopher
affirms
does
nothing
à
or
in
vain
enim
et
natura
nihil
operantur
now
i
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
whether
anything
could
be
more
futile
than
to
summon
these
irrational
creatures
which
can
neither
speak
for
themselves
nor
appoint
proxies
to
defend
their
cause
still
less
are
they
able
to
present
memorials
stating
grounds
of
their
justification
if
then
as
i
have
shown
the
summons
which
is
the
basis
of
all
judicial
action
is
null
and
void
the
proceedings
dependent
upon
it
will
not
be
able
to
stand
enim
principalis
causa
non
consistat
neque
ea
quae
consequuntur
locum
the
counsel
for
the
defence
rests
his
argument
of
which
the
extract
just
given
may
suffice
as
a
sample
upon
the
irrationality
and
consequent
irresponsibility
of
his
clients
for
this
reason
he
maintains
that
the
judge
can
not
appoint
a
procurator
to
represent
them
and
cites
legal
authorities
to
show
that
the
incompetency
of
the
principal
implies
the
incompetency
of
the
proxy
in
conformity
with
the
maxim
directe
fieri
prohibetur
per
indirectum
concedi
non
in
like
manner
the
invalidity
of
the
summons
bars
any
charge
of
contempt
of
court
and
condemnation
for
contumacy
furthermore
the
very
nature
of
excommunication
is
such
that
it
can
not
be
pronounced
against
them
since
it
is
defined
as
ecclesiam
positio
vel
è
qualibet
communione
vel
quolibet
legitimo
actu
but
these
animals
can
not
be
expelled
from
the
church
because
they
are
not
members
of
it
and
do
not
fall
under
its
jurisdiction
as
the
apostle
paul
says
ye
judge
them
that
are
within
and
not
them
also
that
are
afficit
animam
non
corpus
nisi
per
quandam
consequentiam
cujus
medicina
the
animal
soul
not
being
immortal
can
not
be
affected
by
such
sentence
which
involves
the
loss
of
eternal
salvation
vergit
in
dispendium
aeternae
a
still
more
important
consideration
is
that
these
insects
are
only
exercising
an
innate
right
conferred
upon
them
at
their
creation
when
god
expressly
gave
them
every
green
herb
for
meat
a
right
which
can
not
be
curtailed
or
abrogated
simply
because
it
may
be
offensive
to
man
in
support
of
this
view
he
quotes
passages
from
cicero
s
treatise
the
epistle
of
jude
and
the
works
of
thomas
aquinas
finally
he
maintains
that
his
clients
are
agents
of
the
almighty
sent
to
punish
us
for
our
sins
and
to
hurl
anathemas
against
them
would
be
to
fight
against
god
en
prendre
à
who
has
said
i
will
send
wild
beasts
among
you
which
shall
destroy
you
and
your
cattle
and
make
you
few
in
that
all
flesh
has
corrupted
its
way
upon
the
earth
he
thinks
is
as
true
now
as
before
the
deluge
and
cites
about
a
dozen
lines
from
the
of
ovid
in
confirmation
of
this
fact
in
conclusion
he
demands
the
acquittal
of
the
defendants
and
their
exemption
from
all
further
prosecution
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
his
replication
answers
these
objections
in
regular
order
showing
in
the
first
place
that
while
the
law
may
not
punish
an
irrational
creature
for
a
crime
already
committed
it
may
intervene
as
in
the
case
of
an
insane
person
to
prevent
the
commission
of
a
crime
by
putting
the
madman
in
a
or
throwing
him
into
prison
he
elucidates
this
principle
by
a
rather
illustration
from
the
legal
enactments
concerning
betrothal
and
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
it
follows
then
inferentially
that
the
aforesaid
animals
can
be
properly
summoned
to
appear
and
that
the
summons
is
valid
inasmuch
as
this
is
done
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
causing
damage
henceforth
ores
en
and
only
incidentally
to
punish
them
for
injuries
already
to
affirm
that
such
animals
can
not
be
anathematized
and
excommunicated
is
to
doubt
the
authority
conferred
by
god
upon
his
dear
spouse
the
church
whom
he
has
made
the
sovereign
of
the
whole
world
having
in
the
words
of
the
psalmist
put
all
things
under
her
feet
all
sheep
and
oxen
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
fowl
of
the
air
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
whatsoever
passeth
through
the
paths
of
the
seas
guided
by
the
holy
spirit
she
does
nothing
unwisely
and
if
there
is
anything
in
which
she
should
show
forth
her
power
it
is
in
protecting
and
preserving
the
most
perfect
work
of
her
heavenly
husband
to
wit
man
who
was
made
in
the
divine
image
and
the
orator
then
dilates
on
the
grandeur
and
glory
of
man
and
interlards
his
harangue
with
quotations
from
sacred
and
profane
writers
moses
paul
pliny
ovid
silius
italicus
and
pico
di
mirandola
and
declares
that
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
than
to
deprive
such
a
being
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
for
the
sake
of
vile
and
paltry
in
reply
to
the
statement
of
thomas
aquinas
quoted
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
that
it
is
futile
to
curse
animals
as
such
the
plaintiffs
advocate
says
that
they
are
not
viewed
merely
as
animals
but
as
creatures
doing
harm
to
man
by
eating
and
wasting
the
products
of
the
soil
designed
for
human
sustenance
in
other
words
he
ascribes
to
them
a
certain
diabolical
character
but
why
dwell
upon
this
point
since
besides
the
instances
recorded
in
holy
writ
in
which
god
curses
inanimate
things
and
irrational
creatures
we
have
an
infinite
number
of
examples
of
holy
men
who
have
excommunicated
noxious
animals
it
will
suffice
to
mention
one
familiar
to
us
all
and
constantly
before
our
eyes
in
the
town
of
aix
where
hugon
bishop
of
grenoble
excommunicated
the
serpents
which
infested
the
warm
baths
and
killed
many
of
the
inhabitants
by
biting
them
now
it
is
well
known
that
if
the
serpents
in
that
place
or
in
the
immediate
vicinity
bite
any
one
the
bite
is
no
longer
fatal
the
venom
of
the
reptile
was
stayed
and
annulled
by
virtue
of
the
excommunication
so
that
no
hurt
ensues
from
the
bite
although
the
bite
of
the
same
kind
of
serpent
outside
of
the
region
affected
by
the
ban
is
followed
by
that
serpents
and
other
poisonous
reptiles
could
be
deprived
of
their
venom
by
enchantment
and
thus
rendered
harmless
is
in
accord
with
the
teachings
of
the
bible
thus
we
read
in
ecclesiastes
x
surely
the
serpent
will
bite
without
enchantment
unless
it
be
enchanted
and
its
bite
disenvenomed
a
curious
superstition
concerning
the
adder
is
referred
to
in
the
psalms
lviii
where
the
wicked
are
said
to
be
like
the
deaf
adder
that
stoppeth
her
ear
which
will
not
hearken
to
the
voice
of
charmers
charming
never
so
the
lord
is
also
represented
by
jeremiah
viii
as
threatening
to
send
serpents
cockatrices
among
you
which
will
not
be
charmed
and
they
shall
bite
it
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
the
prosecutor
that
the
defendants
might
be
locusts
which
would
not
be
excommunicated
the
objection
that
god
has
sent
these
insects
as
a
scourge
and
that
to
anathematize
them
would
be
to
fight
against
him
is
met
by
saying
that
to
have
recourse
to
the
offices
of
the
church
is
an
act
of
religion
which
does
not
resist
but
humbly
recognizes
the
divine
will
and
makes
use
of
the
means
appointed
for
averting
the
divine
wrath
and
securing
the
divine
favour
after
the
advocates
had
finished
their
pleadings
the
case
was
summed
up
by
the
episcopal
procurator
substantially
as
follows
the
arguments
offered
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
against
the
proceedings
instituted
by
the
inhabitants
as
complainants
are
worthy
of
careful
consideration
and
deserve
to
be
examined
soberly
and
maturely
because
the
bolt
of
excommunication
should
not
be
hurled
recklessly
and
at
random
la
being
a
weapon
of
such
peculiar
energy
and
activity
that
if
it
fails
to
strike
the
object
against
which
it
is
hurled
it
returns
to
smite
him
who
hurled
this
notion
that
an
anathema
is
a
dangerous
missile
to
him
who
hurls
it
unlawfully
or
for
an
unjust
purpose
retroacting
like
an
australian
boomerang
survives
in
the
homely
proverb
curses
like
chickens
come
home
to
the
bishop
s
proctor
reviews
the
speeches
of
the
lawyers
but
seems
to
have
his
brains
somewhat
muddled
by
them
it
is
truly
a
deep
sea
he
says
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
touch
bottom
we
can
not
tell
why
god
has
sent
these
animals
to
devour
the
fruits
of
the
earth
this
is
for
us
a
sealed
book
he
suggests
it
may
be
because
the
people
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
poor
begging
at
their
doors
and
goes
off
into
a
long
eulogy
on
the
beauty
of
charity
with
an
anthology
of
extracts
from
various
writers
in
praise
of
among
which
is
one
from
eusebius
descriptive
of
hell
as
a
cold
region
where
the
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
are
attributed
to
the
torments
of
eternal
frost
instead
of
everlasting
fire
ab
illo
frigore
in
quo
erit
fletus
et
stridor
again
the
plague
of
insects
may
be
due
to
irreverence
shown
in
the
churches
which
he
declares
have
been
changed
from
the
house
of
god
into
houses
of
assignation
on
this
point
he
quotes
from
tertullian
augustine
and
numa
pompilius
and
concludes
by
recommending
that
sentence
of
excommunication
be
pronounced
upon
the
insects
and
that
the
prayers
and
penances
customary
in
such
cases
be
imposed
upon
the
inhabitants
after
this
discourse
which
reads
more
like
a
homily
from
the
pulpit
than
a
plea
at
the
bar
and
in
the
mouth
of
the
bishop
s
proctor
is
simply
an
pro
the
official
gave
judgment
in
favour
of
the
plaintiffs
the
sentence
which
was
pronounced
in
latin
befitting
the
dignity
and
solemnity
of
the
occasion
condemned
the
defendants
to
vacate
the
premises
within
six
days
on
pain
of
anathema
the
official
begins
by
stating
the
case
as
that
of
the
people
locusts
declaring
that
the
guilt
of
the
accused
has
been
clearly
proved
by
the
testimony
of
worthy
witnesses
and
as
it
were
by
public
rumour
and
inasmuch
as
the
people
have
humbled
themselves
before
god
and
supplicated
the
church
to
succour
them
in
their
distress
it
is
not
fitting
to
refuse
them
help
and
solace
walking
in
the
footsteps
of
the
fathers
sitting
on
the
having
the
fear
of
god
before
our
eyes
and
confiding
in
his
mercy
relying
on
the
counsel
of
experts
we
pronounce
and
publish
our
sentence
as
follows
in
the
name
and
by
virtue
of
god
the
omnipotent
father
son
and
holy
spirit
and
of
mary
the
most
blessed
mother
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
the
authority
of
the
holy
apostles
peter
and
paul
as
well
as
by
that
which
has
made
us
a
functionary
in
this
case
we
admonish
by
these
presents
the
aforesaid
locusts
and
grasshoppers
and
other
animals
by
whatsoever
name
they
may
be
called
under
pain
of
malediction
and
anathema
to
depart
from
the
vineyards
and
fields
of
this
district
within
six
days
from
the
publication
of
this
sentence
and
to
do
no
further
damage
there
or
if
on
the
expiration
of
this
period
the
animals
have
refused
to
obey
this
injunction
then
they
are
to
be
anathematized
and
accursed
and
the
inhabitants
of
all
classes
are
to
beseech
almighty
god
the
dispenser
of
all
good
gifts
and
the
dispeller
of
all
evils
to
deliver
them
from
so
great
a
calamity
not
forgetting
to
join
with
devout
supplications
the
performance
of
all
good
works
and
especially
the
payment
of
tithes
without
fraud
according
to
the
approved
custom
of
the
parish
and
to
abstain
from
blasphemies
and
such
other
sins
as
are
of
a
public
and
particularly
offensive
appendix
b
it
is
doubtful
whether
one
could
find
in
the
ponderous
tomes
of
scholastic
divinity
anything
surpassing
in
comical
and
sheer
nonsense
the
forensic
eloquence
of
eminent
lawyers
as
transmitted
to
us
in
the
records
of
legal
proceedings
of
this
kind
although
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
as
we
have
seen
ventured
to
question
the
propriety
and
validity
of
such
prosecutions
his
scepticism
does
not
seem
to
have
been
taken
seriously
but
was
evidently
smiled
at
as
the
trick
of
a
pettifogger
bound
to
use
every
artifice
to
clear
his
clients
in
the
writings
of
mediæval
jurisprudents
the
right
and
fitness
of
inflicting
judicial
punishment
upon
animals
appear
to
have
been
generally
admitted
thus
guy
pape
in
his
of
the
parliament
of
qu
raises
the
query
whether
a
brute
beast
if
it
commit
a
crime
as
pigs
sometimes
do
in
devouring
children
ought
to
suffer
death
and
answers
the
question
unhesitatingly
in
the
affirmative
animal
brutum
delinquat
sicut
quandoque
faciunt
porci
qui
comedunt
pueros
an
debeat
mori
dico
quod
jean
duret
in
his
elaborate
treatise
on
pains
and
penalties
des
peines
et
des
cf
viii
takes
the
same
view
declaring
that
if
beasts
not
only
wound
but
kill
and
eat
any
person
as
experience
has
shown
to
happen
frequently
in
cases
of
little
children
being
eaten
by
pigs
they
should
pay
the
forfeit
of
their
lives
and
be
condemned
to
be
hanged
and
strangled
in
order
to
efface
the
memory
of
the
enormity
of
the
the
distinguished
belgian
jurist
jodocus
damhouder
discusses
this
question
in
his
criminalium
cap
cxlii
and
holds
that
the
beast
is
punishable
if
it
commits
the
crime
through
natural
malice
and
not
through
the
instigation
of
others
but
that
the
owner
can
redeem
it
by
paying
for
the
damage
done
nevertheless
he
is
not
permitted
to
keep
ferocious

so
as
to
be

peril
to

occasionally
a

enlightened
jurist
had
the
and
courage
to
protest
against
such
perversions
and
travesties
of
justice

in
which
he
argued
that
corpses
the
ashes
and
the
memory
of
the
dead
brute
beasts
and
inanimate
things
are
not
legal
persons
and
therefore
do
not
come
within
the
jurisdiction
of

court
curiously
enough
a
case
somewhat
analogous
to
those
discussed
by
pierre
ayrault
was
adjudicated
upon
only
a
few
years
ago
a
frenchman
bequeathed
his

to
his

in

income
to

the
preservation
of
his
mortal
remains
and
the
adornment
of
the
magnificent
mausoleum
in
which
they
were
sepulchred
his
contested
the
will
which
was
declared
null
and
void
by
the
court
on
the
ground
that
a
subject
deprived
of
individuality
or
of
civil
personality
could
not
inherit
the
same
principle
would
apply
to
the
infliction
of
penalties
upon
such
subjects
the
only
kind
of
legacy
that
will
cause
a
man

memory
to
be
cherished
is
the
form
of
bequest
which
makes

states
in
his
de
that
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
peasants
of
the

brought
a
complaint
against
some
spanish
flies
which
were
accordingly
cited
to
appear
at
a
specified
time
and
answer
for
their
conduct

in
consideration
of
their
small
size
and
the
fact
that
they
had
not
yet
reached
their
majority
the
judge
appointed
for
them
a
curator
who
defended
them
with
great
dignity
and
although
he
was
unable
to
prevent
the
banishment
of
his
wards
he
obtained
for
them
the
use
of
a
piece
of
land
to
which
they
were
permitted
peaceably
to
retire
how
they
were
induced
to
go
into
this

to
remain

already

the

the
prosecuting
attorney
and
a
long
list
of

who
testified
that
the
serious
injury
done
by
these
creatures
rendered
it
quite
impossible
for

upon

agricultural
class
by

by

an
old
swiss
chronicler
named
schilling
gives
a
full
account
of
the
prosecution
and
anathematization
of
a
species
of
vermin
called
inger
which
seems
to
have
been
a
coleopterous
insect
of
the
genus
brychus
and
very
destructive

conducted
before
the
bishop
of
lausanne
by
the
authority

under
the
jurisdiction
of

the
first
document
recorded
is
a
long
and
earnest
declaration
and
admonition
delivered
from
the
pulpit
by
a
bernese
bernhard
schmid
who
begins
by
stating
that
his
dearly
beloved
are
doubtless
aware
of
the
serious
injury
done
by
the
inger
and
of
the
suffering
which
they
have
caused

is
termed

a
brief
history
of
the
matter
and
of
the
measures
taken
to
procure
relief
the
mayor
and
common
council
of
berne
were
besought
in
their
wisdom
to
devise
some
means
of
staying
the
plague
and
after
much
earnest
deliberation
they
held
counsel
with
the
bishop
of
lausanne
who
with
fatherly
feeling
took
to
heart
so
great
affliction
and
harm
and
by
an
episcopal
mandate
enjoined
the
inger
from
committing
further
depredations
after
exhorting
the
people
to
entreat
god
by
a
common
prayer
from
house
to
house
to
remove
the
scourge
he
proceeds
to
warn
and
threaten
the
vermin
in
the
following
manner
thou
irrational
and
imperfect
creature
the
inger
called
imperfect
because
there
was
none
of
thy
species
in
noah

ark
at
the
time
of
the
great
bane
and
ruin
of
the
deluge
thou
art
now
come
in
numerous
bands
and
hast
done
immense
damage
in
the
ground
and
above
the
ground
to
the
perceptible
diminution
of
food
for
men
and
animals
and
to
the
end
that
such
things
may
cease
my
gracious
lord
and
bishop
of
lausanne
has
commanded
me
in
his
name
to
admonish
you
to
withdraw
and
to
abstain
therefore
by
his
command
and
in
his
name
and
also
by
virtue
of
the
high
and
holy
trinity
and
through
the
merits
of
the
redeemer
of
mankind
our
saviour
jesus
christ
and
in
virtue
of
and
obedience
to
the
holy
church
i

and
admonish
you
each
and
all
to
depart
within
the
next
six
days
from
all
places
where
you
have
secretly

openly
done

and
spots
where
things
nutritious
to
men
and
to
beasts
spring
up
and
grow
and
to
betake
yourselves
to
the
spots
and
places
where
you
and
your
bands
shall
not
be
able
to
do
any
harm
secretly
or
openly
to
the
fruits
and

however
you
do
not

obey
this
command

you
have
some
reason
for
not
complying

and
summon
you
in
virtue
of
and
obedience
to
the
holy
church
to
appear
on
the
sixth
day
after
this
execution
at
precisely
one
o
clock
after
midday
at
wifflisburg
there
to
justify
yourselves
or
to
answer
for
your
conduct
through
your
advocate
before
his
grace
the
bishop
of
lausanne
or
his
vicar
and
deputy
thereupon
my
lord
of
lausanne
or
his
deputy
will
proceed
against
you
according
to
the
rules
of
justice
with
curses
and
other
exorcisms
as
is
proper
in
such
cases
in
accordance
with
legal
form
and
established
the
priest
then
exhorts
his
dear
children
devoutly
to
beg
and
to
pray
on
their
knees
with
paternosters
and
ave
marias
to
the
praise
and
honour
of
the
high
and
holy
trinity
and
to
invoke
and
crave
the
divine
mercy
and
help
in
order
that
the
inger
may
be
driven
away
appendix
there
is
no
further
record
of
proceedings
at
this
time
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
detection
of
some
technical
error
rendered
it
necessary
to
postpone
the
case
since
this
pettifogger
s
trick
was
almost
always
resorted
to
and
proved
generally
successful
in
procuring
an
adjournment
at
any
rate
either
this
or
a
precisely
similar
trial
occurred
in
the
following
year
early
in
may
the
mayor
and
common
council
of
berne
sent
copies
of
the
monitorium
and
citation
issued
by
the
bishop
of
lausanne
to
their
representative
for
distribution
among
the
priests
of
the
afflicted
parishes
in
order
that
it
might
be
promulgated
from
their
respective
pulpits
and
thus
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
delinquents
about
a
week
later
on
may
the
same
authorities
sent
also
a
letter
to
the
bishop
of
lausanne
asking
for
new
instructions
in
the
matter
as
they
were
not
certain
how
they
should
proceed
urging
that
immediate
steps
should
be
taken
as
the
further
delay
would
be
utterly
this
impatience
would
seem
to
imply
that
the
anathema
had
been
hanging
fire
for
some
time
and
that
the
prosecution
was
identical
with
that
of
the
preceding
year
the
appointed
term
having
elapsed
and
the
inger
still
persisting
in
their
obduracy
the
mayor

the
trial
began
a
couple
of
days
later
and
was
conducted
with
less
of
the
law
s
delay
than
usual
inasmuch
as
it
ended
on
the
day
of
the
same
month
the
defender
of
the
insects
was
a
certain
jean
perrodet
of
freiburg
who
according
to
all
accounts
was
a
very
inefficient
advocate
and
does
not
appear
to
have
contested
the
case
with
the
ability
and
energy
which
the
interests
of
his
clients
required
the
sentence
of
the
court
with
the
appended
anathema
of
the
bishop
was
as
follows
ye
accursed
uncleanness
of
the
inger
which
shall
not
be
called
animals
nor
mentioned
as
such
ye
have
been
heretofore
by
virtue
of
the
appeal
and
admonition
of
our
lord
of
lausanne
enjoined
to
withdraw
from
all
fields
grounds
and
estates
of
the
bishopric
of
lausanne
or
within
the
next
six
days
to
appear
at
lausanne
through
your
proctor
to
set
forth
and
to
hear
the
cause
of
your
procedure
and
to
act
with
just
judgment
either
for
or
against
you
pursuant
to
the
said
citation
thereupon
our
gracious
lords
of
berne
solicited
by
their
mandate
such
a
day
in
court
at
lausanne
and
there
before
the
tribunal
renewed
their
plaint
in
their
name
and
in
that
of
all
the
provinces
of
the
said
bishopric
and
your
reply
thereto
through
your
proctor
has
been
fully
heard
and
the
legal
terms
have
been
justly
observed
by
both
parties
and
a
lawful
decision
pronounced
word
for
word
in
this
wise
we
benedict
of
montferrand
bishop
of
lausanne
having
heard
the
entreaty
of
the
high
and
mighty
lords
of
berne
against
the
inger
and
the
ineffectual
and
rejectable
answer
of
the
latter
and
having
thereupon
fortified
ourselves
with
the
holy
cross
and
having
before
our
eyes
the
fear
of
god
from
whom
alone
all
just
judgments
proceed
and
being
advised
in
this
cause
by
a
council
of
men
learned
in
the
law
do
therefore
acknowledge
and
avow
in
this
our
writing
that
the
appeal
against
the
detestable
vermin
and
inger
which
are
harmful
to
herbs
vines
meadows
grain
and
other
fruits
is
valid
and
that
they
be
exorcised
in
the
person
of
jean
perrodet
their
defender
in
conformity
therewith
we
charge
and
burden
them
with
our
curse
and
command
them
to
be
obedient
and
anathematize
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
that
they
turn
away
from
all
fields
grounds
enclosures
seeds
fruits
and
produce
and
depart
by
virtue
of
the
same
sentence
i
declare
and
affirm
that
you
are
banned
and
exorcised
and
through
the
power
of
almighty
god
shall
be
called
accursed
and
shall
daily
decrease
whithersoever
you
may
go
to
the
end
that
of
you
nothing
shall
remain
save
for
the
use
and
profit
of
man
aliquid
in

the
phrase
si
beswärt
werden
in
die

johannis
perrodeti
irs
does
not
imply
that
the
vermin
or
the
devils
of
which
they
were
supposed
to
be
incarnations
were
to
be
conjured
into
him
but
refer
to
him
merely
as
their
proctor
and
legal
representative
the
results
of
the
prosecution
which
had
been
awaited
with
intense
and
anxious
interest
by
the
people
were
received
with
great
joy
and
the
bernese
government
ordered
a
full
report
of
the
proceedings
to
be
made
the
ecclesiastical
anathema
however
proved
to
be
nothing
more
came
of
it
says
schilling
owing
to
our
another
chronicler
adds
that
god
permitted
the
inger
to
remain
as
a
plague
and
a
punishment
until
the
people
repented
of
their
wickedness
and
gave
evidence
of
their
love
and
gratitude
to
him
namely
by
giving
to
the
church
tithes
of
what
the
insects
had
not
destroyed
the
swiss
priest
in
his
malediction
declares
that
the
inger
were
not
in
noah
s
ark
and
even
denies
that

animals
properly
speaking
stigmatizing
them
as
living
corruption
products
of
spontaneous
generation
perhaps
or
more
probably
creations
of
the
devil
this
position
was
assumed
in
order
to
escape
the
gross
impropriety
and
glaring
incongruity
of
having
the
church
of
god
curse
the
creatures
which
god
had
made
and
pronounced
very
good
and
afterwards
took
pains
to
preserve
from
destruction
by
the
deluge
this
difficulty
always
a
serious
one
was
as
we
have
seen
one
of
the
chief
points
urged
by
the
counsel

the
defence
in

of

clients

the
following
formula
for
banning
serpents
and
expelling
them
from
human
habitations
inculcating
incidentally
the
iniquity
of
perjury
and
judicial
injustice
by
virtue
of
this
ban
and
conjuration
i
command
you
to
depart
from
this
house
and
cause
it
to
be
as
hateful
and
intolerable
to
you
as
the

who
knowingly
bears
false

or
pronounces
an
unjust

it
might
be

so
that
there
may
be
left
in

nothing
noxious
nothing
pestiferous
or

nothing
pernicious
but
that
everything
in
it
may
be
pure
and
immaculate
in

that
we
may
use
whatever
is
created
in
it
for
our
welfare

to
thy

that
on

in

of
the
communes
of
chiavenna
mese

prada
and
samolico
before
the
commissioner
hartmann
planta
and
brought
complaint
against
certain
caterpillars
on
account
of
the
devastations
committed
by
them
demanding
that
these
hurtful
creatures
should
be
summoned
by
the
proper
sheriff
to
appear
in
court
on
june
at
a
specified
hour
in
order
to
have
a
curator
and
defender
appointed
who
should
answer
for
them
to
the
plaintiffs
a
second
document
dated
june
and
signed
by
the
notary
battista
visconti
certifies
that
the
said
summons
had
been
duly
issued
and
five
copies
of
the
same
been
posted
each
on
a
tree
in
the
five
forests
in
the
territory
of
the
aforesaid
five
communes
a
third
document
of
the
same
date
required
the
advocate
of
the
accused
cesare
de
peverello
to
appear
before
the
court
on
the
following
tuesday
july
in
behalf
of
his
recusant
clients
who
were
charged
with
trespassing
upon
the
fields
gardens
and
orchards
and
doing
great
damage
therein
instead
of
remaining
in
their
habitat
the
forest
the
prosecutors
required
that
they
should
seek
their
food
in
wild
and
wooded
places
and
cease
from
ravaging
cultivated
grounds
a
fourth
document
contains
an
account
of
the
trial
the
pleadings
of
the
respective
parties
so
far
as
they
are
preserved
do
not
differ
essentially
from
those
already
quoted
in
the
fifth
and
final
document
the
court
recognizes
the
right
of
the
caterpillars
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
provided
the
exercise
of
this
right
does
not
destroy
or
impair
the
happiness
of
man
to
whom
all
lower
animals
are
accordingly
a
definite
place
of
abode
is
to
be
assigned
to
them
and
various
places
are
proposed
the
protocol
is
incomplete
so
that
we
are
left
in
ignorance
of
the
ultimate
decision
the
whole
is
written
in
execrable
latin
quite
worthy
of
the
subject
more
than
later
the
franciscan
friars
of
the
cloister
of
anthony
in
the
province
of
piedade
no
maranhão
brazil
were
greatly
annoyed
by
termites
which
devoured
their
food
destroyed
their
furniture
and
even
threatened
to
undermine
the
walls
of
the
monastery
application
was
made
to
the
bishop
for
an
act
of
interdiction
and
excommunication
and
the
accused
were
summoned
to
appear
before
an
ecclesiastical
tribunal
to
give
account
of
their
conduct
the
lawyer
appointed
to
defend
them
urged
the
usual
plea
about
their
being
god
s
creatures
and
therefore
entitled
to
sustenance
and
made
a
good
point
in
the
form
of
an
ad
by
praising
the
industry
of
his
clients
the
white
ants
and
declaring
them
to
be
in
this
respect
far
superior
to
their
prosecutors
the
gray
friars
he
also
maintained
that
the
termites
were
not
guilty
of
criminal
aggression
but
were
justified
in
appropriating
the
fruits
of
the
fields
by
the
right
derived
from
priority
of
possession
inasmuch
as
they
had
occupied
the
land
long
before
the
monks
came
and
encroached
upon
their
domain
the
trial
lasted
for
some
time
and
called
forth
remarkable
displays
of
legal
learning
and
forensic
eloquence
with
numerous
citations
of
sacred
and
profane
authorities
on
both
sides
and
ended
in
a
compromise
by
the
terms
of
which
the
plaintiffs
were
obliged
to
provide
a
suitable
reservation
for
the
defendants
who
were
commanded
to
go
thither
and
to
remain
henceforth
within
the
prescribed
limits
in
the
chronicles
of
the
cloister
it
is
recorded
under
date
of
that
no
sooner
was
the
order
of
the
prelatic
judge
promulgated
by
being
read
officially
before
the
hills
of
the
termites
than
they
all
came
out
and
marched
in
columns
to
the
place
assigned
the
monkish
annalist
regards
this
prompt
obedience
as
conclusive
proof
that
the
almighty
endorsed
the
decision
of
the
court
cited
by

about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
inhabitants
of
several
villages
in
aargau
were
greatly
annoyed
by
swarms
of
gadflies
and
petitioned
the
bishop
of
constance
for
relief
in
the
episcopal
rescript
written
and
signed
by
the
vidame
georg

the
people
are
enjoined
to
abstain
from
dancing
on
sundays
and
feast
days
from
all
forms
of
libidinousness
gambling
with
cards
or
dice
and
other
frivolities
these
injunctions
are
followed
by
prayer
and
the
usual
formulas
of
conjuration
and
exorcism
the
original
document
was
written
in
latin
and
preserved
in
the
archives
of
baden
in
switzerland
but
is
now
lost
in
the
landamman
of
unterwalden
johannes

took
a
german
translation
of
it
home
with
him
to
be
used
in
case
of
need
against
the
vergifteten
würmer
and
deposited
it
in
the
archives
of
obwalden
where
it
still
remains
it
was
published
in
by
merz
in
protestant
communities
the
priest
as
exorcist
has
been
superseded
to
a
considerable
extent
by
the
professional
conjurer
who
in
some
portions
of
europe
is
still
employed
to
save
crops
from
devouring
insects
and
similar
plagues
a
curious
instance
of
this
kind
is
recorded
in
görres
for
heft
vii
a
protestant
gentleman
in
westphalia
whose
garden
was
devastated
by
worms
after
having
tried
divers
vermicidal
remedies
in
vain
resolved
to
have
recourse
to
a
conjurer
the
wizard
came
and
walked
about
among
the
vegetables
touching
them
with
a
wand
and
muttering
enchantments
some
workmen
who
were
repairing
the
roof
of
a
stable
near
by
made
fun
of
this
and
began
to
throw
bits
of
lime
at
the
conjurer
he
requested
them
to
desist
and
finally
said
if
you
don
t
leave
me
in
peace
i
shall
send
all
the
worms
up
on
the
this
threat
only
excited
the
hilarity
of
the
scoffers
who
continued
to
ridicule
and
disturb
him
in
his
incantations
thereupon
he
went
to
the
nearest
hedge
cut
a
number
of
twigs
each
about
a
finger
in
length
and
placed
them
against
the
wall
of
the
stable
soon
the
vermin
began
to
abandon
the
plants
and
crawling
in
countless
numbers
over
the
twigs
and
up
the
wall
took
complete
possession
of
the
roof
in
less
than
an
hour
the
men
were
obliged
to
stop
working
and
stood
in
the
court
below
covered
with
confusion
and
the
writer
who
relates
this
strange
incident
fully
believes
that
it
actually
occurred
and
ascribes
it
to
the
force
of
human
faith
and
the
magnetic
power
of
a
firm
will
over
this
too
is
the
theory
held
by
paracelsus
who
maintained
that
the
effectiveness
of
a
curse
lay
in
the
energy
of
the
will
by
which
the
wish
so
to
speak
concretes
into
a
deed
just
as
anger
directs
the
arm
and
actualizes
itself
in
a
blow
by
fervent
desire
merely
without
any
physical
effort
or
aggressive
act
he
deemed
it
possible
to
wound
a
man
s
body
or
to
pierce
it
through
as
with
a
sword
he
also
held
that
brutes
are
more
easily
exorcised
or
accursed
than
men
for
the
spirit
of
man
resists
more
than
that
of
the
similar
notions
were
entertained
nearly
a
century
later
by
jacob
boehme
who
defines
magic
as
doing
in
the
spirit
of
the
will
an
idea
which
finds
more
recent
and
more
scientific
expression
in
schopenhauer
s
doctrine
of
the
objectivation
of
the
indeed
schopenhauer
s
postulate
of
the
will
as
the
sole
energy
and
actuality
in
the
universe
is
only
the
philosophic
statement
of
an
assumption
upon
which
magicians
and
enchanters
exorcists
and
anathematizers
have
acted
more
or
less
in
all
ages
we
have
a
striking
illustration
of
the
workings
of
some
such
mysterious
force
in
hypnotism
the
reality
of
which
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
deny
however
wonderful
and
incomprehensible
its
manifestations
may
appear
it
is
natural
that
a
religion
of
individual
initiative
and
personal
responsibility
like
protestantism
should
put
less
confidence
in
theurgic
machinery
and
formularies
of
execration
than
a
religion
like
catholicism
in
which
man
s
spiritual
concerns
are
entrusted
to
a
hierarchical
corporation
to
be
managed
according
to
traditional
and
infallible
methods
this
tendency
crops
out
in
a
decree
published
at
dresden
in
by
augustus
duke
and
elector
wherein
he
commends
the
christian
zeal
of
the
worthy
and
pious
parson
daniel
greysser
for
having
put
under
ban
the
sparrows
on
account
of
their
unceasing
and
extremely
vexatious
chatterings
and
scandalous
unchastity
during
the
sermon
to
the
hindrance
of
god
s
word
and
of
christian
but
the
saxon
parson
unlike
the
bishop
of
trier
did
not
expect
that
his
ban
would
cause
the
offending
birds
to
avoid
the
church
or
to
fall
dead
on
entering
it
he
relied
less
on
the
directly
coercive
or
withering
action
of
the
curse
than
on
the
human
agencies
which
he
might
thereby
set
at
work
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
by
his
proscription
he
put
the
culprits
out
of
the
pale
of
public
sympathy
and
protection
and
gave
them
over
as
a
prey
to
the
spoiler
who
was
persuaded
that
he
was
doing
a
pious
work
by
exterminating
them
it
was
solemnly
enjoined
upon
the
hunter
and
the
fowler
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
anathematized
sparrows
with
guns
and
with
snares
mancherlei
visirliche
und
listige
and
the
elector
issued
his
decree
in
order
to
enforce
this
duty
on
all
good
christians
see
appendix
a
faded
and
somewhat
droll
survival
of
ecclesiastical
excommunication
and
exorcism
is
the
custom
still
prevailing
in
european
countries
and
some
portions
of
the
united
states
of
serving
a
writ
of
ejectment
on
rats
or
simply
sending
them
a
friendly
letter
of
advice
in
order
to
induce
them
to
quit
any
house
in
which
their
presence
is
deemed
undesirable
lest
the
rats
should
overlook
and
thus
fail
to
read
the
epistle
it
is
rubbed
with
grease
so
as
to
attract
their
attention
rolled
up
and
thrust
into
their
holes
william
wells
newell
in
a
paper
on
conjuring
rats
printed
in
journal
of
american
gives
a
specimen
of
such
a
letter
dated
maine
and
addressed
in
business
style
to
messrs
rats
and
the
writer
begins
by
expressing
his
deep
interest
in
the
welfare
of
said
rats
as
well
as
his
fears
lest
they
should
find
their
winter
quarters
in
no
seaview
street
uncomfortable
and
poorly
supplied
with
suitable
food
since
it
is
only
a
summer
residence
and
is
also
about
to
undergo
repairs
he
then
suggests
that
they
migrate
to
no
incubator
street
where
they
can
live
snug
and
happy
in
a
splendid
cellar
well
stored
with
vegetables
of
all
kinds
and
can
pass
easily
through
a
shed
leading
to
a
barn
containing
much
grain
he
concludes
by
stating
that
he
will
do
them
no
harm
if
they
heed
his
advice
otherwise
he
shall
be
forced
to
use
rough
on
this
threat
of
resorting
to
rat
poison
in
case
of
the
refusal
to
accept
his
kind
counsel
is
all
that
remains
of
the
once
formidable
anathema
of
the
church
in
scotland
when
these
domestic
rodents
became
too
troublesome
people
of
the
lower
classes
are
wont
to
post
the
following
notice
on
the
walls
of
their
houses
ratton

and
there

and
a
ye
ll
get
your
in
order
to
make
the
conjuration
effective
some
particular
abode
must
be
assigned
to
them
it
is
not
sufficient
to
bid
them
begone
but
they
are
to
be
told
to
go
to
a
definite
place
the
fact
that
they
are
usually
sent
across
a
river
or
brook
may
indicate
a
lingering
tradition
of
their
demoniacal
character
since
according
to
a
widespread
popular
superstition
a
is
a
barrier
to
hobgoblins
and
evil
spirits
a
running
stream
they
dare
na
in
this
case
the
rats
as
imps
of
satan
having
reached
their
destination
would
find
it
impossible
to
return
it
was
in
ireland
the
native
realm
of
bulls
and
like
incongruities
that
conjuring
or
rhyming
rats
seems
to
have
been
most
common
if
we
may
judge
from
the
manner
in
which
it
is
alluded
to
by
the
elizabethan
poets
thus
in
you
like
rosalind
says
in
reference
to
orlando
s
verses
i
was
never
so
since
pythagoras
time
that
i
was
an
irish

which
i

rats
in
ben
jonson
is
still
more
specific
rhime
em
to
death
as
they
do
irish
rats
in
drumming
from
this
reference
to
the
mode
of
conjuring
it
appears
that
the
repeating
of
the
rhymes
was
accompanied
with
the
beating
of
a
drum
as
is
still
the
usage
in
france
from
the
very
earliest
times
a
peculiar
magical
potency
has
been
ascribed
to
words
woven
into
rhythmic
form
the
fascination
which
metrical
expression
even
as
a
mere
jingle
and
jargon
still
retains
for
the
youth
of
the
individual
was
yet
far
more
strongly
felt
in
the
youth
of
the
race
the
simple
song
was
intoned
as
a
spell
and
the
rude
chant
mumbled
as
a
charm
in
france
the
conjuration
of
bears
a
more
distinctly
religious
stamp
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
the
feast
of
the
torches
fête

the
peasants
wander
in
all
directions
through
the
fields
and
orchards
with
lighted
torches
of
twisted
straw
uttering
the
following
incantation
which
not
only
threatens
to
burn
the
whiskers
of
obdurate

but
also
hints
at
the
propensities

form

varies
in

usually

of

they
refuse

gregory

was
bishop

sixth

states
in
his
of

that

p
the
use
of
the
means
of
conjuration
is
unquestionably
of
very
ancient
date
thus
in
a
treatise
on
agriculture
entitled
τὰ
γεωπονικά
and
consisting
of
twenty
books
written
in
the
tenth
century
by
the
bithynian
byzantine
kassianos
bassos
the
following
prescription
is
given
for
getting
rid
of
take
a
slip
of
paper
and
write
on
it
these
words
i
adjure
you
o
mice
who
dwell
here
not
to
injure
me
yourselves
nor
to
permit
any
other
mouse
to
do
so
and
i
make
over
to
you
this
field
describing
it
but
should
i
find
you
staying
here
after
having
been
warned
with
the
help
of
the
mother
of
the
gods
i
will
cut
you
in
seven
the
author
quotes
this
recipe
in
order
as
he
says
that
nothing
may
remain
unrecorded
but
expressly
declares
that
he
has
no
confidence
in
its
efficiency
and
advises
the
husbandman
to
put
his
trust
in
good
bassos
derived
the
materials
for
his
popular
encyclopædia
chiefly
from
the
geoponics
composed
by
anatolios
and
didymos
some
six
centuries
earlier
and
even
most
of
his
citations
of
classical
writers
are
taken
from
the
same
sources
that
the
exorcism
is
pagan
in
its
origin
is
evident
from
the
invocation
of
the
aid
of
cybele
for
the
destruction
of
disobedient
vermin
in
a
christian
conjuration
the
mother
of
god
would
have
been
substituted
for
the
mother
of
the
gods
whom
the
greeks
revered
as
the
personification
of
and
nature
the
resemblance
of
this
formula
which
the
greeks
may
have
borrowed
with
the
worship
of
cybele
from
the
phrygians
to
the
yankee
s
letter
of
advice
is
peculiarly
interesting
in
the
ancient
conjuration
the
harmful
or
undesirable
animals
were
commanded
to
go
to
a
certain
locality
set
apart
for
them
and
this
injunction
was
accompanied
with
dire
threats
in
case
of
disobedience
the
milder
epistolary
form
of
the
present
day
is
more
advisory
and
persuasive
and
offers
them
inducements
to
migrate
and
to
take
up
their
abode
elsewhere
sometimes
this
kind
counsel
is
given
verbally
as
for
example
in
thuringia
where
it
is
customary
to
get
rid
of
by
going
into
the
garden
requesting
them
to
depart
and
calling
out
in
yonder
village
is
thus
implying
that
they
will
find
better
entertainment
at
this
festival

p
the
willingness
of
peasant
communities
to
ward
off
evil
from
themselves
at
the
expense
of
their
neighbours
is
a
survival
of
the
primitive
ethics
which
recognizes
only
the
rights
of
the
family
or
tribe
and
treats
all
aliens
as
foes
it
is
the
same
feeling
that
causes
the
inhabitants
of
the
alps
to
erect
for
the
purpose
of
averting
and
hailstones
from
themselves
by
diverting
them
into
an
adjacent
valley
this
method
of
protection
is
based
upon
the
theory
that
tempests
hurricanes
and
all
violent
commotions
of
nature
are
the
work
of
demons
or
witches
who
avoid
the
symbol
of
christ
s
death
and
the
world
s
redemption
and
direct
their
fury
elsewhere
a
like
egotism
is
expressed
in
the
inscription
on
many
houses
of
peasants
entreating
florian
to
preserve
their
habitation
from
flames
and
to
set
fire
to
others
as
though
the
holy
man
must
indulge
his
incendiary
passion
by
pouring
out
upon
some
human
abode
the
blazing
vessel
which
he
is
represented
as
bearing
in
his
hand
the
inscription
is
the
same
as
that

the
fox

his
castle

to

might
be
added
other
cases
such
as
the
prosecution
and
malediction
of
noxious
insects
at
glurns
in
the
tyrol
in
at
als
in
jutland
in
at
bouranton
in
at
lyö
in
denmark
in
and
at
pozega
in
slavonia
in
in
the
latter
case
one
of
the
largest
of
the
locusts
was
seized
and
tried
and
then
put
to
death
by
being
thrown
into
the
water
with
anathemas
on
the
whole
species
a
few
years
ago
swarms
of
locusts
devastated
the
region
near
kallipolis
in
turkey
and
a
petition
was
sent
by
the
christian
population
to
the
monks
of
mount
athos
begging
them
to
bear
in
solemn
procession
through
the
fields
the
girdle
of
basilius
in
order
to
expel
the
insects
this
request
was
granted
and
as
the
locusts
gradually
disappeared
because
there
was
little
or
nothing
left
for
them
to
eat
the
orthodox
of
the
greek
church
from
the
bishop
to
the
humblest
laymen
firmly
believed
or
at
least
maintained
that
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
pious
mohammedans
exorcise
and
ostracize
locusts
and
other
harmful
insects
by
reading
the
koran
aloud
in
the
ravaged
fields
as
was
recently
done
at
denislue
in
asia
minor
with
satisfactory
results
also
as
late
as
at
pleternica
in
slavonia
a
pig
was
tried
and
executed
for
having
maliciously
bitten
off
the
ears
of
a
female
infant
aged
one
year
the
flesh
of
the
condemned
animal
was
cut
in
pieces
and
thrown
to
the
dogs
and
the
head
of
the
family
in
which
the
pig
lived
as
is
the
custom
of
pigs
among
the
peasants
of
that
country
was
put
under
bonds
to
provide
a
dowry
for
the
mutilated
child
so
that
the
loss
of
her
ears
might
not
prove
to
be
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
her
marriage
p
it
would
be
incorrect
to
infer
from
the
tables
just
referred
to
that
no
judicial
punishment
of
animals
occurred
in
the
tenth
century
or
that
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
were
peculiarly
addicted
to
such
practices
it
is
well
known
that
during
some
of
the
darkest
periods
of
the
middle
ages
and
even
in
later
times
the
registers
of
the
courts
were
very
imperfectly
kept
and
in
many
instances
the
archives
have
been
entirely
destroyed
it
is
highly
probable
therefore
that
the
cases
of
capital
prosecution
and
conviction
of
animals
which
have
been
collected
and
printed
by
and
others
however
thorough
their
investigations
may
have
been
constitute
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
those
which
actually
took
place
beasts
were
often
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
and
strangely
enough
it
was
in
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
an
age
of
comparative
enlightenment
that
this
cruel
penalty
seems
to
have
been
most
frequently
inflicted
occasionally
a
merciful
judge
adhered
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
curbed
its
barbarous
spirit
by
sentencing
the
culprit
to
be
slightly
singed
and
then
to
be
strangled
before
being
committed
to
the
flames
sometimes
brutes
were
doomed
to
be
buried
alive
thus
we
have
the
receipt
of
phélippart
sergeant
of
high
justice
of
the
city
of
amiens
for
the
sum
of
sixteen
soldi
in
payment
for
services
rendered
in
march
in
having
buried
in
the
earth
two
pigs
which
had
torn
and
eaten
with
their
teeth
a
little
child
in
the
faubourg
of
amiens
who
for
this
cause
passed
from
life
to
death
allé
de
vie
a
in
on
the
of
december
a
pig
in
the
commune
of
was
condemned
to
be
buried
all
alive
tout
for
having
devoured
a
little
child
in
l
hostel
de
la
again
a
century
earlier
in
two
pigs
were
subjected
to
this
punishment
on
the
vigil
of
the
holy
virgin
at
oppenheim
on
the
rhine
for
having
killed
a
child
more
than
three
centuries
later
the
same
means
were
employed
for
curing
murrain
which
in
the
summer
of
had
broken
out
at
beutelsbach
in
würtemberg
and
carried
off
many
head
of
cattle
by
the
advice
of
a
french
veterinary
doctor
who
was
quartered
there
with
the
army
of
general
moreau
the
town
bull
was
buried
alive
at
the
crossroads
in
the
presence
of
several
hundred
persons
we
are
not
informed
whether
this
sacrifice
proved
to
be
a
sufficiently
powerful
medicine
to
stay
the
epizoötic
plague
the
noteworthy
fact
is
that
the
superstitious
rite
was
prescribed
and
performed
not
by
an
indian
magician
or
an
african
sorcerer
but
by
an
official
of
the
french
republic
animals
are
said
to
have
been
even
put
to
the
rack
in
order
to
extort
confession
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
in
such
cases
the
judge
had
the
slightest
expectation
that
any
confession
would
be
made
he
wished
merely
to
observe
all
forms
prescribed
by
the
law
and
to
set
in
motion
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
before
pronouncing
judgment
the
statement
of
a
french
writer
arthur
mangin
homme
et
la
paris
that
the
cries
which
they
uttered
under
torture
were
received
as
confessions
of
guilt
is
absurd
no
such
notion
was
ever
entertained
by
their
tormentor
the
question
which
under
the
circumstances
would
seem
to
be
only
a
wanton
and
superfluous
act
of
cruelty
was
nevertheless
an
important
element
in
determining
the
final
decision
since
the
sentence
of
death
could
be
commuted
into
banishment
whipping
incarceration
or
some
milder
form
of
punishment
provided
the
criminal
had
not
confessed
his
guilt
under
torture
the
use
of
the
rack
might
be
therefore
a
merciful
means
of
escaping
the
gallows
appeals
were
sometimes
made
to
higher
tribunals
and
the
judgments
of
the
lower
courts
annulled
or
modified
in
one
instance
a
sow
and
a
were
condemned
to
be
hanged
on
appeal
and
after
a
new
trial
they
were
sentenced
to
be
simply
knocked
on
the
head
occasionally
an
appeal
led
to
the
acquittal
of
the
accused
in
at
near
paris
a
pig
convicted
of
having
eaten
a
child
was
publicly
burned
by
order
of
the
monks
of
sainte
geneviève
in
the
tribunal
of
falaise
sentenced
a
sow
to
be
mangled
and
maimed
in
the
head
and
forelegs
and
then
to
be
hanged
for
having
torn
the
face
and
arms
of
a
child
and
thus
caused
its
death
here
we
have
a
strict
application
of
the
the
primitive
retributive
principle
of
taking
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
as
if
to
make
the
travesty
of
justice
complete
the
sow
was
dressed
in
man
s
clothes
and
executed
on
the
public
square
near
the
at
an
expense
to
the
state
of
ten
sous
and
ten
deniers
besides
a
pair
of
gloves
to
the
hangman
the
executioner
was
provided
with
new
gloves
in
order
that
he
might
come
from
the
discharge
of
his
duty
metaphorically
at
least
with
clean
hands
thus
indicating
that
as
a
minister
of
justice
he
incurred
no
guilt
in
shedding
blood
he
was
no
common
but
a
public
functionary
a
master
of
high
works
des
hautes
as
he
was
officially
styled
appendix
we
may
add
that
the
west
wall
of
the
south
branch
of
the
transept
in
the
church
of
the
holy
trinity
at
falaise
in
normandy

formerly
adorned
with
a
of
this
execution

is
mentioned

fully

abbé

several
years
later
the
abbé
states
that
about
the
year
the
entire
church
including
the
fresco
was
whitewashed
so
that
the
picture
has
since
then
been
invisible
and
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
no
engraving
or
other
copy
of
it
has
ever
been
made

the

cut

this
mutilation
was
an
arbitrary
and
act
dictated
solely
by
considerations
of
personal
convenience
hangmen
often
indulged
in
capricious
and
supererogatory
cruelty
in
the
exercise
of
their
patibulary
functions
and
mediæval
as
well
as
later
writers
on
criminal
jurisprudence
repeatedly
complain
of
this
evil
and
call
for
reform
thus
damhouder
in
his
criminalium
de
urges
magistrates
to
be
more
careful
in
selecting
persons
for
this
important
office
and
not
to
choose
assiduous
gamblers

malicious
impious
blasphemers

other
violators
of

vindicators

hardened
wretches

the

in
franconia
a
sow
which
had
bitten
off
the
ear
and
torn
the
hand
of
a
carpenter
s
child
was
given
into
custody
whereupon
the
hangman
without
legal
authority
took
it
to
the
schindrasen
and
there
hanged
it
publicly
to
the
disgrace
and
detriment
of
the

this
impudent
usurpation
of
judiciary
powers
jack
ketch

forced
to
flee

never
dared

hence
arose
the
proverbial
phrase
schweinfurter
sauhenker
schweinfurt
used
to
characterize
a
low
and
lawless
ruffian
and
vile
fellow
of
the
baser
sort
it
was
not
the
mere
killing
of
the
sow
but
the
execution
without
a
judicial
decision
the
insult
and
contempt
of
the
magistracy

a
curious
contribution

rather
odd

should
have
adopted

code
against

and
then
enlarged
it
so
as
to
include

kept

incurs
a
somewhat
heavy
penalty

this
exercise
of
justice
is
quite
common
among
the

inflicted

that

shall
be
by

on

the
plaintiffs
were
the

who
preferred
charges
against

procured
the
evidence
necessary
to
its
conviction
appendix
o
in
a
pig
was
hanged
at
mortaign
for
having
sacrilegiously
eaten
a
consecrated
wafer
and
in
a
case
of
infanticide
it
is
expressly
stated
in
the
plaintiff
s
declaration
that
the
pig
killed
the
child
and
ate
of
its
flesh
although
it
was
friday
and
this
violation
of
the
prescribed
by
the
church
was
urged
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
accepted
by
the
court
as
a
serious
aggravation
of
the
porker
s
offence
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
multiply
examples
of
this
kind
infanticidal
swine
were
hanged
in
at
in
at
brochon
in
at
trochères
and
in
at
abbeville
the
execution
took
place
under
the
auspices
of
the
aldermanity
and
with
the
tolling
of
the
it
was
evidently
regarded
as
a
very
solemn
affair
the
records
of
mediæval
courts
the
chronicles
of
mediæval
cloisters
and
the
archives
of
mediæval
cities
especially
such
as
were
under
episcopal
sovereignty
and
governed
by
ecclesiastical
law
are
full
of
such
cases
the
capital
punishment
of
a
dumb
animal
for
its
crimes
seems
to
us
so
irrational
and
absurd
that
we
can
hardly
believe
that
sane
and
sober
men
were
ever
guilty
of
such
folly
yet
the
idea
was
quite
familiar
to
our
ancestors
even
in
shakespeare
s
day
in
the
brilliant
elizabethan
age
of
english
literature
as
is
evident
from
a
passage
in
gratiano
s
invective
against
shylock
thy
currish
spirit
govern
d
a
wolf
who
hang
d
for
human
slaughter
even
from
the
gallows
did
his
fell
soul
fleet
and
whilst
thou
lay
st
in
thy
unhallow
d
dam
infus
d
itself
in
thee
for
thy
desires
are
wolfish
bloody
starv
d
and
that
such
cases
usually
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
monasteries
and
spiritualities
and
were
tried
by
their
peculiarly
organized
tribunals
will
not
seem
strange
when
we
remember
that
these
religious
establishments
were
great
landed
proprietors
and
at
one
time
owned
nearly
of
all
real
estate
in
france
the
frequency
with
which
pigs
were
brought
to
trial
and
adjudged
to
death
was
owing
in
a
great
measure
to
the
freedom
with
which
they
were
permitted
to
run
about
the
streets
and
to
their
immense
number
the
fact
that
they
were
under
the
special
protection
of
anthony
of
padua
conferred
upon
them
a
certain
immunity
so
that
they
became
a
serious
nuisance
not
only
endangering
the
lives
of
children
but
also
generating
and
disseminating
diseases
it
is
recorded
that
in
as
the
crown
prince
philippe
son
of
louis
the
gross
was
riding
through
one
of
the
principal
streets
of
paris
a
boar
belonging
to
an
abbot
ran
violently
between
the
legs
of
his
horse
so
that
the
prince
fell
to
the
ground
and
was
killed
in
some
cities
like
grenoble
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
authorities
treated
them
very
much
as
we
do
mad
dogs
empowering
the
carnifex
to
seize
and
slay
them
whenever
found
at
large
on
the
municipality
of
naples
passed
an
ordinance
that
the
pigs
which
frequented
the
streets
and
piazzas
to
the
detriment
and
danger
of
the
inhabitants
should
be
removed
from
the
city
to
a
wood
or
other
uninhabited
place
or
be
slaughtered
within
twelve
days
on
pain
of
the
penalties
already
prescribed
and
threatened
probably
in
the
order
issued
on
of
the
same
year
it
would
seem
however
that
these
ordinances
did
not
produce
the
desired
effect
or
soon
fell
into
abeyance
since
another
was
promulgated
four
years
later
on
expelling
the
pigs
from
the
city
and
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
corrupted
the
atmosphere
and
thus
imperiled
the
public
health
sanitary
considerations
and
salutary
measures
of
this
kind
were
by
no
means
common
in
the
middle
ages
but
were
a
gradual
outgrowth
of
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
it
was
with
the
revival
of
letters
that
men
began
to
love
cleanliness
and
to
appreciate
its
hygienic
value
as
well
as
its
æsthetic
beauty
little
heed
was
paid
to
such
things
in
the
good
old
times
of
earlier
date
when
the
test
of
holiness
was
the
number
of
years
a
person
went
unwashed
and
the
growth
of
the
soul
in
sanctity
was
estimated
by
the
thickness
of
the
layers
of
filth
on
the
body
as
the
age
of
the
earth
is
determined
by
the
strata
which
compose
its
crust
the
freedom
of
the
city
almost
universally
enjoyed
by
mediæval
swine
is
still
maintained
by
their
descendants
in
many
towns
of
southern
italy
and
sicily
where
they
ramble
at
will
through
the
streets
or
assemble
in
council
before
the
palace
of
the
prefect
cf
d
addosio
pp
in
the
latter
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
tribunals
began
to
take
preventive
measures
against
the
public
nuisance
by
holding
the
inhabitants
responsible
for
the
injuries
done
to
individuals
by
swine
running
at
large
and
by
threatening
with
corporal
as
well
as
pecuniary
punishment
all
persons
who
left
such
beasts
without
a
good
and
sure
thus
it
is
recorded
that
on
the
of
march
a
sow
with
a
black
snout
for
the
cruelty
and
ferocity
shown
in
murdering
a
little
child
four
months
old
having
eaten
and
devoured
the
head
the
left
hand
and
the
part
above
the
right
breast
of
the
said
infant
was
condemned
to
be
exterminated
to
death
and
to
this
end
to
be
hanged
by
the
executioner
of
high
justice
on
a
tree
within
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
said
judicature
on
the
highway
from
to
the
court
of
the
judicatory
of
senlis
which
pronounced
this
sentence
on
complaint
of
the
procurator
of
the
seigniory
of
also
forbade
all
the
inhabitants
and
subjects
of
the
said
seignioralty
to
permit
the
like
beasts
to
go
unguarded
on
pain
of
an
arbitrary
fine
and
of
corporal
chastisement
in
default
of
payment
appendix
but
although
pigs
appear
to
have
been
the
principal
culprits
especially
as
regard
infanticide
other
quadrupeds
were
frequently
called
to
answer
for
similar
crimes
thus
in
a
bull
belonging
to
a
farmer
in
the
village
of
moisy
escaped
into
the
highway
where
it
attacked
a
man
and
injured
him
so
severely
that
he
died
a
few
hours
afterwards
the
ferocious
animal
was
seized
and
imprisoned
by
the
officers
of
charles
count
of
valois
and
after
being
tried
and
convicted
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
this
judgment
of
the
court
was
confirmed
by
the
parliament
of
paris
and
the
execution
took
place
at
on
the
common
gallows
an
appeal
based
upon
the
incompetency
of
the
court
was
then
made
by
the
procurator
of
the
order
of
the
hospital
of
the
ville
de
moisy
to
the
parliament
of
la
chandeleur
which
decided
that
the
bull
had
met
with
its
deserts
and
been
justly
put
to
death
but
that
the
count
of
valois
had
no
jurisdiction
on
the
territory
of
moisy
and
his
officials
no
power
to
institute
proceedings
in
this
case
the
sentence
was
right
in
equity
but
judicially
and
technically
wrong
and
could
not
therefore
serve
as
a
precedent
there
is
also
extant
an
order
issued
by
the
magistracy
of
gisors
in
commanding
payment
to
be
made
to
the
carpenter
who
had
erected
the
scaffold
on
which
an
ox
had
been
executed
for
its
again
on
the
of
may
the
judicial
authorities
of
the
cistercian
abbey
of
beaupré
near
beauvais
condemned
a
red
bull
to
be
executed
until
death
inclusively
for
having
killed
with
furiosity
a
lad
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
of
age
named
lucas

who
was
employed
in
tending
the
horned
cattle
of
the
farmer
jean

appendix
q
in
the
carthusians
of
dijon
caused
a
horse
to
be
condemned

death
for
homicide
and
as
late
as
a
mare
was
burned
by
the
decision
and
decree
of
the
parliament
of
aix
which
it
must
be
remembered
was
not
a
legislative
body
but
a
supreme
court
of
judicature
thus
differing
in
its
functions
from
the
states
general
the
only
and
representative
assembly
in
france
that
may
be
said
to
have
corresponded
in
the
slightest
degree
to
the
modern
conception
of
a
parliament
in
the
magistrates
of
bâle
sentenced
a
cock
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
for
the
heinous
and
unnatural
crime
of
laying
an
the
da
was
held
on
a
height
near
the
city
called
the
kohlenberg
with
as
great
solemnity
as
would
have
been
observed
in
consigning
a
heretic
to
the
flames
and
was
witnessed
by
an
immense
crowd
of
townsmen
and
peasants
the
statement
made
by
gross
in
his
basler
that
the
executioner
on
cutting
open
the
cock
found
three
more
eggs
in
him
is
of
course
absurd
we
have
to
do
in
this
case
not
with
a
freak
of
nature
but
with
the
freak
of
an
excited
imagination
tainted
with
superstition
other
instances
of
this
kind
have
been
recorded
one
in
the
swiss
prättigau
as
late
as
although
in
many
cases
the
execution
of
the
gallinaceous
malefactor
was
more
summary
and
less
ceremonious
than
at
bâle
the
was
supposed
to
be
the
product
of
a
very
old
cock
and
to
furnish
the
most
active
ingredient
of
witch
ointment
when
hatched
by
a
serpent
or
a
toad
or
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
it
brought
forth
a
cockatrice
or
basilisk
which
would
hide
in
the
roof
of
the
house
and
with
its
baneful
breath
and
eye
destroy
all
the
inmates
many
naturalists
believed
this
fable
as
late
as
the
eighteenth
century
and
in
the
french
savant
lapeyronie
deemed
this
absurd
notion
worthy
of
serious
refutation
and
read
a
paper
entitled
observation
sur
les
petits
oeufs
de
poule
sans
jaune
que
l
on
appelle
vulgairement
oeufs
de
coq
before
the
academy
of
sciences
in
order
to
prove
that
cocks
never
lay
and
that
the
small
and
yolkless
eggs
attributed
to
them
owe
their
peculiar
shape
and
condition
to
a
disease
of
the
hen
resulting
in
a
hydropic
malformation
of
the
oviduct
a
farmer
brought
him
several
specimens
of
this
sort
somewhat
larger
than
a
pigeon
s
egg
and
assured
him
that
they
had
been
laid
by
a
cock
in
his
own
barnyard
on
opening
one
of
them
lapeyronie
was
surprised
to
find
only
a
very
slight
trace
of
the
yolk
resembling
a
small
serpent
he
now
began
to
suspect
that
the
cock
might
be
an
hermaphrodite
but
on
killing
and
dissecting
it
discovered
nothing
in
support
of
this
theory
the
internal
organs
being
all
perfectly
healthy
and
normal
but
although
the
unfortunate
chanticleer
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
scientific
investigation
of
a
popular
delusion
the
eggs
in
question
continued
to
be
produced
until
the
farmer
by
carefully
watching
the
fowls
detected
the
hen
that
laid
them
the
dissection
showed
that
the
pressure
of
a
bladder
of
serous
fluid
against
the
oviduct
had
so
contracted
it
that
the
egg
in
passing
had
the
yolk
squeezed
out
of
it
leaving
merely
a
yellowish
discoloration
that
looked
like
a
worm
another
peculiarity
of
this
hen
was
that
she
crowed
like
a
hoarse
cock
coq
only
more
violently
a
phenomenon
also
a
source
of
terror
to
the
superstitious
but
ascribed
by
lapeyronie
to
the
same
morbid
state
of
the
oviduct
and
the
consequent
pain
caused
by
the
passage
of
the
egg
de
l
académie
de
paris
pp
a
greek
physiologus
of
the
twelfth
century
written
in
verse
calls
the
animal
hatched
from
the
egg
of
an
old
cock
επτεινάρια
a
name
which
would
imply
some
sort
of
winged
creature
it
was
sighted
like
the
basilisk
and
endowed
also
in
other
respects
with
the
same
fatal
qualities
in
the
case
of
a
valuable
animal
such
as
an
ox
or
a
horse
the
severity
of
retaliatory
justice
was
often
tempered
by
economical
considerations
and
the
culprit
confiscated
but
not
capitally
punished
thus
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
it
is
expressly
stated
that
it
is
the
law
and
custom
in
burgundy
that
if
an
ox
or
a
horse
commit
one
or
several
homicides
it
shall
not
be
condemned
to
death
but
shall
be
taken
by
the
seignior
within
whose
jurisdiction
the
deed
was
perpetrated
or
by
his
servitors
and
be
confiscated
to
him
and
shall
be
sold
and
appropriated
to
the
profit
of
the
said
seignior
but
if
other
beasts
or
jews
do
it
they
shall
be
hanged
by
the
hind
feet
coustumes
et
stilles
de
bourgoigne
in
giraud
sur
l
histoire
du
droit
ii
quoted
by
amira
it
was
a
cruel
irony
of
the
law
that
conferred
upon
pigs
and
jews
a
perfect
equality
of
rights
by
sending
them
both
to
the
scaffold
animals
were
put
on
a
par
with
old
crones
in
bearing
their
full
share
of
persecution
during
the
witchcraft
delusion
pigs
suffered
most
in
this
respect
since
they
were
assumed
to
be
peculiarly
attractive
to
devils
and
therefore
particularly
liable
to
diabolical
possession
as
is
evident
from
the
legion
that
went
out
of
the
lunatic
and
were
permitted
at
their
own
request
to
enter
into
the
gadarene
herd
of
swine
but
beelzebub
did
not
disdain
to
become
incarnate
in
all
sorts
of
creatures
such
as
cats
dogs
of
high
and
low
degree
wolves
and
indeed
in
any
beast
especially
if
it
chanced
to
be
black
goats
it
is
well
known
were
not
a
too
stinking
habitation
for
him
and
even
to
dwell
in
skunks
he
did
not
despise
the
perpetual
smell
of
burning
sulphur
in
his
subterranean
abode
may
render
him
proof
against
any
less
suffocating
form
of
stench
the
bible
represents
satan
as
going
about
as
a
roaring
lion
and
according
to
the
highest
ecclesiastical
authorities
he
has
appeared
visibly
as
a
raven
a
porcupine
a
toad
and
a
gnat
indeed
there
is
hardly
a
living
creature
in
which
he
has
not
deigned
to
disport
himself
from
a
to
a
bishop
to
say
nothing
of
his
appearing
invisibly
at
times
invisibiliter
if
we
may
believe
what
the
learned
polyhistor
tritheim
tells
of
his
apparitions
as
all
animals
were

the
same
sort
of
retributive
justice
was
recognized
by
the
institutes
of
manu
which
punished
a
thief
by
the
amputation
or
mutilation
of
his
fingers
in
the
covenant
with
noah
it
was
declared
that
human
blood
should
be
required
not
only
at
the
hand
of
man
but
also
at
the
hand
of
every
beast
and
it
was
subsequently
enacted
in
accordance
with
this
fundamental
principle
that
if
an
ox
gore
a
man
or
a
woman
that
they
die
then
the
ox
shall
be
surely
stoned
and
his
flesh
shall
not
be
to
eat
a
creature
which
had
become
the
peer
of
man
in
and
in
judicial
punishment
would
savour
of
anthropophagy
this
decision
of
jewish
as
to
the
use
of
the
flesh
of
otherwise
edible
animals
condemned
to
death
for
crime
has
nearly
always
been
followed
thus
when
in
several
swine
were
executed
for
at
frankfort
on
the
main
their
carcasses
although
doubtless
as
good
pork
as
could
be
found
in
the
shambles
were
thrown
into
the
river
usually
however
they
were
buried
under
the
gallows
or
in
whatever
spot
was
set
apart
for
interring
the
dead
bodies
of
human
criminals
at
ghent
however
in
after
judicial
sentence
of
death
had
been
pronounced
on
a
cow
she
was
slaughtered
and
her
flesh
sold
as
butcher
s
meat
half
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
being
given
as
compensation
to
the
injured
party
and
the
other
half
to
the
city
treasury
for
distribution
among
the
poor
but
her
head
was
struck
off
and
stuck
on
a
stake
near
the
gallows
to
indicate
that
she
had
been
capitally
punished
the
thrifty
flemings
did
not
permit
the
moral
depravity
to
taint
the
material
substance
of
the
bovine
culprit
and
impair
the
excellence
of
the
beef
on
the
other
hand
the
law
faculty
of
the
university
of
leipsic
decided
that
a
cow
which
had
pushed
a
woman
and
thereby
caused
her
death
at
machern
in
saxony
july
should
be
taken
to
a
secluded
and
barren
place
and
there
killed
and
buried
in
this
case
the
flesh
of
the
homicidal
animal
was
not
to
be
eaten
nor
the
hide
converted
into
leather
appendix
in
this
connection
it
may
be
interesting
to
mention
a
decision
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
of
berne
given
in
and
recorded
in
türler
s
gutachten
des
geistlichen
konvents
der
stadt
für
bd
heft
quoted
by
tobler
an
insane
man
was
tried
for
murder
and
the
prosecutor
seems
to
have
urged
that
the
lack
of
moral
responsibility
did
not
suffice
to
relieve
the
accused
of
legal
responsibility
and
to
free
him
from
punishment
citing
as
pertinent
to
the
case
the
mosaic
law
which
inflicted
the
death
penalty
on
an
ox
for
the
like
offence
on
this
point
the
court
replied
in
the
first
place
that
specifically
jewish
law
is
not
binding
upon
other
governments
and
is
not
observed
by
them
either
as
regards
oxen
or
horses
again
even
if
the
jewish
law
should
be
really
applicable
to
all
men
it
could
not
be
appealed
to
in
the
present
case
since
it
is
not
permissible
to
draw
an
inference
bove
ad
inasmuch
as
no
law
is
given
to
the
ox
it
can
not
violate
any
in
other
words
can
not
sin
and
therefore
can
not
be
punished
on
the
other
hand
death
is
a
severe
penalty
for
man
nevertheless
if
god
commanded
that
the
goring
ox
should
be
killed
this
was
done
in
order
to
excite
aversion
to
the
deed
to
prevent
the
animal
from
injuring
others
and
in
this
manner
to
punish
the
owner
of
the
beast
this
fact
however
proves
nothing
touching
the
case
now
before
us
for
although
god
enacted
a
law
for
the
ox
he
did
not
enact
any
for
the
insane
man
and
the
distinction
between
the
goring
ox
and
the
maniac
must
be
observed
an
ox
is
created
for
man
s
sake
and
can
therefore
be
killed
for
his
sake
and
in
doing
this
there
is
no
question
of
right
or
wrong
as
regards
the
ox
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
permissible
to
kill
a
man
unless
he
has
deserved
death
as
a
the
remarkable
points
in
this
decision
are
first
the
abrogation
of
a
biblical
enactment
by
an
ecclesiastical
court
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
secondly
the
discussion
of
a
criminal
act
from
a
psychiatrical
point
of
view
and
the
admission
of
extenuating
and
exculpating
circumstances
derived
from
this
source
the
koran
holds
every
beast
and
fowl
accountable
for
injuries
done
to
each
other
but
reserves
their
punishment
for
the
life
to
come
among
the
kukis
if
a
man
falls
from
a
tree
and
is
killed
it
is
the
sacred
duty
of
the
next
of
kin
to
fell
the
tree
and
cut
it
up
and
scatter
the
chips
abroad
the
spirit
of
the
tree
was
supposed
to
have
caused
the
mishap
and
the
blood
of
the
slain
was
not
thought
to
be
thoroughly
avenged
until
the
offending
object
had
been
effaced
from
the
earth
a
survival
of
this
notion
was
the
custom
of
burning
heretics
and
flinging
their
ashes
to
the
four
winds
or
casting
them
upon
rivers
running
into
the
sea
the
laws
of
drakôn
and
erechtheus
required
weapons
and
all
other
objects
by
which
a
person
had
lost
his
life
to
be
publicly
condemned
and
thrown
beyond
the
athenian
boundaries
this
sentence
of
banishment
then
regarded
as
one
of
the
severest
that
could
be
inflicted
was
pronounced
upon
a
sword
which
had
killed
a
priest
the
wielder
of
the
same
being
unknown
and
also
upon
a
bust
of
the
elegiac
poet
theognis
which
had
fallen
on
a
man
and
caused
his
death
even
in
cases
which
one
would
think
might
be
regarded
as
justifiable
homicide
in
no
such
ground
of
exculpation
seems
to
have
been
admitted
thus
the
statue
erected
by
the
athenians
in
honour
of
the
famous
athlete
nikôn
of
thasos
was
assailed
by
his
envious
foes
and
pushed
from
its
pedestal
in
falling
it
crushed
one
of
its
assailants
and
was
therefore
brought
before
the
proper
tribunal
and
sentenced
to
be
cast
into
the
sea
judicial
proceedings
of
this
kind
were
called
ἄψῦχων
δίκαι
prosecutions
of
lifeless
things
and
were
conducted
before
the
athenian
known
as
the
prytaneion
they
are
alluded
to
by
æschines
pausanias
demosthenes
and
other
writers
and
briefly
described
in
the
of
julius
pollux
and
the
decem
oratorum
of
valerius
harpokration
strictly
speaking
the
term
ἄψῦχων
should
be
applied
only
to
an
inanimate
object
and
not
to
the
brute
which
was
more
correctly
called
ἄφωνον
dumb
but
this
distinction
was
not
always
observed
either
in
common
parlance
or
in
legal
phraseology
the
law
on
this
point
as
formulated
and
expounded
by
plato
ix
was
as
follows
if
a
draught
animal
or
any
other
beast
kill
a
person
unless
it
be
in
a
combat
authorized
and
instituted
by
the
state
the
kinsmen
of
the
slain
shall
prosecute
the
said
homicide
for
murder
and
the
overseers
of
the
public
lands
ἀγρονόμοι
as
many
as
may
be
commissioned
by
the
said
kinsmen
shall
adjudicate
upon
the
case
and
send
the
offender
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
country
ἐξορίζειν
exterminate
in
the
literal
and
original
sense
of
the
term
if
a
lifeless
thing
shall
deprive
a
person
of
life
provided
it
may
not
be
a
thunderbolt
κεραυνός
or
other
missile
βέλος
hurled
by
a
god
but
an
object
which
the
said
person
may
have
run
against
or
by
which
he
may
have
been
struck
and
slain
then
the
kinsman
immediate
to
the
deceased
shall
appoint
the
nearest
neighbour
as
judge
in
order
to
purify
himself
as
well
as
his
next
of
kin
from
but
the
culprit
τὸ
ὄφλον
shall
be
put
beyond
the
boundaries
in
the
same
manner
as
if
it
were
an
in
the
same
section
it
is
enacted
that
if
a
person
be
found
dead
and
the
murderer
be
unknown
then
proclamation
shall
be
made
by
a
herald
on
the
forbidding
the
murderer
to
enter
any
sanctuary
or
the
land
of
the
slain
and
declaring
that
if
discovered
he
shall
be
put
to
death
and
his
body
be
thrown
unburied
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
country
of
the
person
killed
the
object
of
these
measures
was
to
appease
the
erinnys
or
avenging
spirit
of
the
deceased
and
to
avert
the
calamities
which
would
otherwise
be
brought
upon
the
land
in
accordance
with
the
strict
law
of
retribution
demanding
blood
for
blood
no
matter
whether
it
may
have
been
shed
wilfully
or
accidentally
cf
æschylus
where
this
law
νόμος
is
clearly
and
strongly
affirmed
the
same
superstitious
feeling
leads
the
hunters
of
many
savage
tribes
to
beg
pardon
of
bears
and
other
wild
animals
for
killing
them
and
to
purify
themselves
by
religious
rites
from
the
taint
incurred
by
such
an
act
the
μίασμα
of
murder
as
the
greeks
called
it
quite
recently
in
china
fifteen
wooden
idols
were
tried
and
condemned
to
decapitation
for
having
caused
the
death
of
a
man
of
high
military
rank
on
complaint
of
the
family
of
the
deceased
the
viceroy
residing
at
fouchow
ordered
the
culprits
to
be
taken
out
of
the
temple
and
brought
before
the
criminal
court
of
that
city
which
after
due
process
of
law
sentenced
them
to
have
their
heads
severed
from
their
bodies
and
then
to
be
thrown
into
a
pond
the
execution
is
reported
to
have
taken
place
in
the
presence
of
a
large
concourse
of
approving
spectators
and
amid
the
loud
execrations
of
the
masses
who
seem
in
their
excitement
to
have
lost
their
heads
as
well
as
the
hapless
deities
when
the
russian
prince
dimitri
the
son
of
ivan
was
assassinated
on
may
at
uglich
his
place
of
exile
the
great
bell
of
that
town
rang
the
signal
of
insurrection
for
this
serious
political
offence
the
bell
was
sentenced
to
perpetual
banishment
in
siberia
and
conveyed
with
other
exiles
to
tobolsk
after
a
long
period
of
solitary
confinement
it
was
partially
purged
of
its
iniquity
by
conjuration
and
and
suspended
in
the
tower
of
a
church
in
the
siberian
capital
but
not
until
was
it
fully
pardoned
and
restored
to
its
original
place
in
uglich
a
like
sentence
was
imposed
by
a
russian
tribunal
on
a
butting
ram
in
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
mathias
abele
von
lilienberg
in
his
telae
of
which
the
eighth
edition
was
published
at
nuremberg
in
states
that
a
drummer
s
dog
in
an
austrian
garrison
town
bit
a
member
of
the
municipal
council
in
the
right
leg
the
drummer
was
sued
for
damages
but
refused
to
be
responsible
for
the
snappish
cur
and
delivered
it
over
to
the
arm
of
justice
thereupon
he
was
released
and
the
dog
sentenced
to
one
year
s
incarceration
in
the
narrenkötterlein
a
sort
of
pillory
or
iron
cage

on

in

that
several
mad

which
attacked
and
tore
in
pieces
a
franciscan
novice
in
were
by
sentence
and
decree
of
the
court
put
to
it
is
surely
reasonable
enough
that
mad
dogs
should
be
killed
the
remarkable
feature
of
the
case
is
that
they
should
be
formally
tried
and
convicted
as
murderers
by
a
legal
tribunal
and
that
no
account
should
have
been
taken
of
their
rabies
as
an
extenuating
circumstance
or
ground
of
acquittal
in
such
a
case
the
plea
of
insanity
would
certainly
seem
to
be
naturally
suggested
and
perfectly
valid
on
the
other
hand
it
is
expressly
declared
in
the
avesta
that
a
mad
dog
shall
not
be
permitted
to
plead
insanity
in
exculpation
of
itself
but
shall
be
punished
with
the
punishment
of
a
conscious
and
premeditated
offence
by
progressive
mutilation
corresponding
to
the
number
of
persons
or
beasts
it
has
bitten
beginning
with
the
loss
of
its
ears
extending
to
the
crippling
of
its
feet
and
ending
with
the
amputation
of
its
tail
this
cruel
and
absurd
enactment
is
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
kindly
spirit
shown
in
the
avesta
towards
all
animals
recognized
as
the
creatures
of
ahuramazda
and
especially
with
the
many
measures
taken
by
the
as
a
pastoral
people
for
the
protection
of
the
dog
indeed
a
paragraph
immediately
following
in
the
same
chapter
commands
the
mazdayasnians
to
treat
such
a
rabid
dog
humanely
and
to
wait
upon
him
with
medicaments
and
to
try
to
heal
him
just
as
they
would
care
for
a
righteous
on
this
important
point
avestan
legislation
is
so
inconsistent
and
that
one
may
justly
suspect
the
harsh
enactments
to
be
later
interpolations
a
curious
example
of
imputed
crime
and
its
penal
consequences
is
seen
in
the
roman
custom
of
celebrating
the
anniversary
of
the
preservation
of
the
capitol
from
the
of
the
gauls
not
only
by
paying
honour
to
the
descendants
of
the
sacred
geese
whose
cries
gave
warning
of
the
enemy
s
approach
adorning
them
with
jewels
and
carrying
them
about
in
litters
but
also
by
crucifying
a
dog
as
a
punishment
for
the
want
of
vigilance
shown
by
its
progenitors
on
that
occasion
this
imputation
of
merit
and
demerit
was
really
no
more
absurd
than
to
visit
the
sins
of
the
fathers
on
the
children
as
prescribed
by
jewish
and
other
ancient
lawgivers
or
to
decree
corruption
of
blood
in
persons
attainted
of
treason
as
is
still
the
practice
of
modern
states
or
any
other
theory
of
inherited
guilt
or
scheme
of
vicarious
atonement
that
sets
the
sin
of
the
federal
head
of
the
race
to
the
account
of
his
remotest
posterity
and
relieves
them
from
its
penalties
only
through
the
suffering
and
death
of
a
wholly
innocent
person
they
are
all
applications
of
the
barbarous
principle
which
in
primitive
society
with
its
gross
conceptions
of
justice
made
the
entire
tribe
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
each
of
its
members
the
vendetta
which
continues
to
be
the
unwritten
but
inviolable
code
of
many
communities
is
based
upon
the
same
conception
of
consanguineous
solidarity
for
the
perpetration
and
avenging
of
crime
according
to
an
old
law
abolished
by
king
canute

then
added
as
to
the

of

they
ought
to
suffer
the

penalty
as

since
it
is
highly
probable
that
they
will
sometime
be
guilty
of
the
same
crime
themselves
nevertheless
as
a
special
act
of
clemency
we
grant
them
their
lives
but
at
the

time
declare
them
to
be
incapable
of

from

of
receiving
any
gift
or

in

of

excluded
from

they

of

and

until
they
shall
look
upon

as
a
curse
and
long
for
death
as
a

this
atrocious
edict
of
the
emperors
arcadius
and
honorius
has
its
counterpart
in
the
still
more
radical
code
of
pachacutez
the
justinian
of
the
ancient
peruvians
which
punished
adultery
with
the
wife
of
an
inca
by
putting
to
death
not
only
the
adulteress
and
her
seducer
but
also
the
children
slaves
and
kindred
of
the
culprits
as
well
as
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
in
which
the
crime
was
committed
while
the
city
itself
was
to
be
razed
and
the
site
covered
with
stones
the
principle
enunciated
by
cicero
has
also
been
accepted
by
modern
legislators
as
applicable
to
high
treason
thus
when
tschech
the
burgomaster
of
storkow
attempted
to
take
the
life
of
frederic
william
of
prussia
july
he
was
tried
and
executed
of
the
same
year
on
the
day
after
his
execution
his
only
daughter
elizabeth
was
arrested
and
to
her
inquiry
by
what
right
she
had
been
deprived
of
her
freedom
the
authorities
replied
that
according
to
prussian
law
the
children
of
a
person
convicted
of
high
treason
and
all
the
members
of
his
family
especially
if
they
seemed
to
be
dangerous
and
to
share
the
opinions
of
their
father
can
be
imprisoned
for
life
or
banished
from
the
the
young
lady
was
then
exiled
to
westphalia
and
there
placed
in
the
custody
of
an
extremely
austere
parson
until
she
finally
escaped
to
france
and
afterwards
to
switzerland
where
she
spent
the
rest
of
her
days
when
the
prefects
tatian
and
proculus
fell
into
disgrace
lycia
their
native
land
was
deprived
of
the
autonomy
it
had
hitherto
enjoyed
as
a
roman
province
and
its
inhabitants
were
disfranchised
and
declared
incapable
of
holding
any
office
under
the
empire
so
too
when
joshua
discovered
some
of
the
spoils
of
jericho
hidden
in
the
tent
of
achan
not
only
the
thief
himself
but
also
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
his
oxen
and
his
asses
and
his
sheep
and
his
tent
and
all
that
he
had
were
brought
into
the
valley
of
achor
and
there
stoned
with
stones
and
burned
with
fire
about
this
time
however
such
holocausts
of
justice
were
suppressed
among
the
jews
and
a
law
enacted
that
henceforth
the
fathers
shall
not
be
put
to
death
for
the
children
neither
shall
the
children
be
put
to
death
for
the
fathers
every
man
shall
be
put
to
death
for
his
own
sin
or
as
jeremiah
expresses
it
figuratively
the
children
s
teeth
were
to
be
no
longer
set
on
edge
by
the
sour
grapes
which
their
fathers
had
eaten
yet
the
persistency
of
custom
and
its
power
of
overriding
new
statutes
are
seen
in
the
fact
that
several
centuries
later
at
the
request
of
the
gibeonites
whom
it
had
become
desirable
to
conciliate
david
did
not
scruple
to
deliver
up
to
them
seven
of
saul
s
sons
to
be
hanged
for
the
evil
which
their
father
had
wrought
in
slaying
these
foes
of
israel
it
would
have
been
a
parallel
case
if
bismarck
had
sought
to
win
the
friendship
and
favour
of
the
french
by
giving
into
their
hands
the
descendants
of
blücher
to
be
guillotined
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
or
after
having
made
a
political
pilgrimage
to
canossa
should
surrender
the
children
of
falk
to
be
racked
and
burned
at
the
stake
by
the
ultramontanes
according
to
the
current
orthodox
theology
treason
against
god
committed
by
our
common
progenitor
worked
corruption
of
blood
in
the
whole
human
race
all
the
children
of
men
being
attainted
with
guilt
in
consequence
of
the
act
of
their
first
parent
this
crude
and
brutal
conception
of
justice
is
the
survival
of
a
primitive
and
barbarous
state
of
society
and
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
the
most
highly
civilized
peoples
who
have
outgrown
this
notion
and
set
it
aside
in
the
secular
relations
of
man
to
man
still
cling
to
it
as
something
sacred
and
sublime
in
the
spiritual
relations
of
man
to
the
deity
only
the
and
sovereign
of
the
universe
is
supposed
to
continue
to
administer
law
and
justice
on
principles
which
and
the
enlightened
opinion
of
mankind
have
long
since
abrogated
and
banished
from
earthly
legislation
thus
the
divine
government
instead
of
keeping
pace
with
the
progress
of
human
institutions
still
corresponds
to
the
ideals
of
right
and
retribution
entertained
by
savage
tribes
and
the
lowest
types
of
mankind
the
horrible
mutilations
to
which
criminals
were
formerly
subjected
originated
in
an
endeavour
to
administer
strictly
justice
what
could
be
fairer
or
more
fit
than
to
punish
perjury
by
cutting
off
the
two
fingers
which
the
perjurer
had
held
up
in
taking
the
violated
oath
it
was
a
popular
belief
that
the
fingers
of
an
undetected
perjurer
would
grow
out
of
the
grave
after
death
seeking
retributive
amputation
as
a
plant
seeks
the
light
and
that
his
ghost
would
never
rest
until
this
penalty
had
been
inflicted
see
heinrich
roch
where
a
case
of
this
kind
is
recorded
the
carolina
criminalis
although
in
many
respects
an
advance
on
mediæval
penal
legislation
doomed
incendiaries
to
be
burned
alive
and
an
old
law
cited
by
döpler
ii
condemned
a
man
who
had
dug
up
and
removed
a
boundary
stone
to
be
buried
in
the
earth
up
to
his
neck
and
to
have
his
head
plowed
off
with
a
new
plow
thus
symbolizing
in
his
own
person
the
grave
offence
which
he
had
committed
ivan
basilovitch
a
muscovite
prince
ordered
that
an
ambassador
who
did
not
uncover
in
his
presence
should
have
his
hat
nailed
to
his
head
and
it
is
a
feeble
survival
of
the
same
idea
of
proper
punishment
that
makes
the
american
farmer
nail
the
dead
hawk
to
his
just
as
in
former
times
it
was
customary
to
crucify
highway
robbers
at
according
to
an
old
roman
law
ascribed
to
numa
pompilius
the
oxen
which
plowed
up
a
boundary
stone
as
well
as
their
driver
were
sacrificed
to
jupiter
terminus
in
the
early
development
of
agriculture
and
the
transition
from
communal
to
personal
property
in
land
this
severe
enactment
was
deemed
necessary
to
the
protection
of
the
sacra
saxa
by
which
the
boundary
lines
of
the
fields
were
defined
only
by
making
the
violation
of
enclosed
ground
a
sacrilege
was
it
possible
to
prevent
encroachments
upon
it
so
strong
was
the
lingering
prejudice
against
individual
possessions
of
this
kind
running
in
the
blood
of
a
people
descended
from
nomadic
tribes
of
herdsmen
who
regarded
sedentary
communities
engaged
in
tilling
the
soil
as
their
direst
foes
the
lawgiver
knew
very
well
that
the
oxen
were
involuntary
agents
and
that
the
plowman
alone
was
culpable
but
when
a
religious
atonement
is
to
be
made
and
an
angry
god
appeased
moral
distinctions
determining
degrees
of
responsibility
are
uniformly
ignored
and
the
innocent
are
doomed
to
suffer
with
the
guilty
the
oxen
were
tainted
by
the
performance
of
an
act
in
which
the
exercise
of
their
will
was
not
involved
and
must
therefore
be
consigned
to
the
offended
deity
the
same
is
true
of
the
plowman
who
did
not
escape
immolation
even
when
the
or
displacement
of
the
boundary
stone
occurred
unintentionally
that
the
feeling
which
found
expression
in
such
enactments
and
usages
and
survives
in
schemes
of
expiation
and
vicarious
sacrifice
lies
scarcely
under
the
polished
surface
of
our
civilization
is
evident
from
the
force
and
suddenness
with
which
it
breaks
out
under
strong
excitement
as
when
cincinnati
rioters
burn
the
because
they
suspect
the
judges
of
venality
and
are
dissatisfied
with
the
verdicts
of
the
juries
the
primitive
man
and
the
savage
like
the
low
and
ignorant
masses
of
civilized
communities
do
not
take
into
consideration
whether
the
objects
from
which
they
suffer
injury
are
intelligent
agents
or
not
but
wreak
their
vengeance
on
stocks
and
stones
and
brutes
obeying
only
the
rude
instinct
of
revenge
the
power
of
restraining
these
aboriginal
propensities
and
of
nicely
analyzing
actions
and
studying
mental
conditions
in
order
to
ascertain
degrees
of
moral
responsibility
presupposes
a
high
degree
of
mental
development
and
refinement
and
great
acuteness
of
psychological
perception
and
is
in
fact
only
a
recent
acquisition
of
a
small
minority
of
the
human
race
the
vast
bulk
of
mankind
will
have
to
pass
through
a
long
process
of
intellectual
evolution
and
rise
far
above
their
present
place
in
the
ascending
scale
of
culture
before
they
attain
it
for
this
reason
lombroso
would
abolish
trial
by
jury
which
seems
to
him
not
a
sign
of
progress
towards
better
judicatory
methods
but
a
clumsy
survival
of
primitive
justice
as
administered
by
barbarous
tribes
and
even
gregarious
animals
it
makes
the
administration
of
justice
dependent
upon
popular
prejudice
and
passion
and
finds
its
most
violent
expression
or
explosion
in
lynch
law
which
is
only
trial
by
a
jury
of
the
whole
community
gone
mad
it
would
certainly
be
a
dismal
farce
to
apply
to
the
criminal
classes
the
principle
that
every
man
must
be
judged
by
his
peers
in
the
cantonal
courts
of
switzerland
the
verdict
of
the
jury
is
uniformly
in
favour
of
the
native
against
the
foreigner
no
matter
what
the
merits
of
the
case
may
be
and
this
outrageous
perversion
of
right
and
equity
is
called
patriotism
a
term
which
conveniently
sums
up
and
euphemizes
the
general
sentiment
of
helvetian
innkeepers
and
tradesmen
that
the
stranger
within
their
gates
is
their
legitimate
spoil
and
has
no
other
d
in
italy
especially
in
naples
and
sicily
a
thief
may
be
sometimes
condemned
but
a
murderer
is
almost
invariably
acquitted
by
the
jury
whose
decision
expresses
the
corrupted
moral
sense
of
a
people
accustomed
to
admire
the
bandit
as
a
hero
and
to
consider
brigandage
a
highly
honourable
profession
the
childish
disposition
to
punish
irrational
creatures
and
inanimate
objects
which
is
common
to
the
infancy
of
individuals
and
of
races
has
left
a
distinct
trace
of
itself
in
that
peculiar
institution
of
english
law
known
as
deodand
and
derived
partly
from
jewish
and
partly
from
old
german
usages
and
traditions
if
a
horse
says
blackstone
or
any
other
animal
of
its
own
motion
kill
as
well
an
infant
as
an
adult
or
if
a
cart
run
over
him
they
shall
in
either
case
be
forfeited
as
if
a
man
in
driving
a
cart
tumble
to
the
ground
and
lose
his
life
by
the
wheel
passing
over
him
if
a
tree
fall
on
a
man
and
cause
his
death
or
if
a
horse
kick
his
keeper
and
kill
him
then
the
wheel
the
tree
and
the
horse
are
deodands
and
are
to
be
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
quae
movent
ad
mortem
sunt
deo
is
the
principle
laid
down
by
bracton
if
therefore
a
run
over
a
man
and
kill
him
not
only
is
the
wheel
but
also
the
whole
cart
to
be
declared
deodand
because
the
momentum
of
the
cart
in
motion
contributed
to
the
man
s
death
but
if
the
shaft
fall
upon
a
man
and
kill
him
then
only
the
shaft
is
deodand
since
the
cart
did
not
participate
in
the
crime
it
is
also
stated
curiously
enough
that
if
an
infant
fall
from
a
cart
not
in
motion
and
be
killed
neither
the
horse
nor
the
cart
shall
be
declared
deodand
not
so
however
if
an
adult
come
to
his
death
in
this
manner
the
ground
of
this
distinction
is
not
quite
clear
although
it
may
arise
from
the
assumption
that
the
child
had
no
business
there
or
that
such
an
accident
could
not
have
happened
to
an
adult
unless
there
was
something
irregular
and
perverse
in
the
conduct
of
the
animal
or
the
vehicle
in
the
archives
of
maryland

by

inquest

on
the
body
of
a
planter
who
by
the
fall
of
a
tree
had
his
bloud
bulke

furthermore
the
jurors

say
that
the

until

of

the

had
to

cf

a
modern
survival
of
this
legal
principle
is
the
notion
current
especially
among
criminals
that
any
part
of
the
body
of
a
deceased
person
or
better
still
of
an
executed
murderer
exerts
a
magical
and
protective
power
or
brings
good
luck
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
among
the
peasants
and
lower
classes
of
europe
to
put
the
finger
of
a
dead
thief
under
the
threshold
in
order
to
protect
the
house
homœpathically
against
theft
the
persistency
of
this
superstition
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
farmer
s
hired
man
named
sier
and
belonging
to
the
hamlet
of
heumaden
was
tried
at
weiden
in
bavaria
may
and
convicted
of
having
exhumed
the
body
of
a
newly
buried
child
in
the
churchyard
of
moosbach
and
taken
out
one
of
its
eyes
which
he
supposed
would
render
him
invisible
to
mortal
sight
like
the
famous
of
old
german
mythology
and
thus
enable
him
to
indulge
with
impunity
his
propensity
to
steal
for
this
sacrilege
he
was
sentenced
to
one
year
and
two
months
imprisonment
and
to
the
loss
of
civil
rights
for
three
years
in
some
of
the
scottish
islands
it
is
the
custom
to
beach
a
boat
from
which
a
fisherman
had
been
drowned
cursing
it
for
its
misdeed
and
letting
it
dry
and
fall
to
pieces
in
the
sun
the
boat
is
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
must
no
longer
be
permitted
to
sail
the
sea
with
innocent
craft
scotch

not
seem
to
have
recognized
deodand
in
the
strictly
etymological
sense
of
the
term
but
only
escheat
in
other
words
the
confiscated
objects
were
not
necessarily
applied
to
pious
purposes
anima

et
omnium
fidelium
but
were
simply
forfeited
to
the
king
or
to
the
state
this
form
of
confiscation
never
prevailed
so
generally
in
central
and
eastern
as
in
western
europe
some
german
communities
and
territorial
sovereigns
introduced
it
from
france
but
so
modified
the
practical
application
of
the
principle
as
to
award
to
the
injured
party
the
greater
portion

of
the

of

are
exceedingly
vague
and
unsatisfactory
evidently
the
learned
author
of
the
could
give
no
consistent
explanation
of
these
vestiges
of
ancient
criminal
legislation
his
statement
that
they
were
intended
to
punish
the
owner
of
the
forfeited
property
for
his
negligence
and
his
further
assertion
that
they
were
designed
in
the
blind
days
of
popery
as
an
expiation
for
the
souls
of
such
as
were
snatched
away
by
sudden
death
are
equally
incorrect
in
most
cases
the
owner
was
perfectly
innocent
and
very
frequently
was
himself
the
victim
of
the
accident
he
suffered
only
incidentally
from
a
penalty
imposed
for
a
wholly
different
purpose
just
as
a
slaveholder
incurs
loss
when
his
human
chattel
commits
murder
and
is
hanged
for
it
the
primal
object
was
to
atone
for
the
taking
of
life
in
accordance
with
certain
crude
conceptions
of
retribution
under
hierarchical
governments
the
prominent
idea
was
to
appease
the
wrath
of
god
who
otherwise
might
visit
mankind
with
famine
and
pestilence
and
divers
retaliatory
scourges
for
the
same
reason
the
property
of
a
suicide
was
deodand
thus
the
wife
and
children
of
the
deceased
who
may
be
supposed
to
have
already
suffered
most
from
the
fatal
act
were
subjected
to
additional
punishment
for
it
by
being
robbed
of
their
rightful
inheritance
yet
this
was
by
no
means
the
intention
of
the
lawmakers
who
simply
wished
to
prescribe
an
adequate
atonement
for
a
grievous
offence
and
in
seeking
to
accomplish
this
main
purpose
ignored
the
effect
of
their
action
upon
the
fortunes
of
the
heirs
or
deemed
it
a
matter
of
minor
consideration
ancient
legislators
uniformly
regarded
a
de
as
a
criminal
against
society
and
treated
him
as
a
kind
of
traitor
the
man
had
enjoyed
the
support
and
protection
of
the
during
his
infancy
and
youth
and
by
taking
his
own
life
he
shook
off
the
responsibilities
and
shirked
the
duties
devolving
upon
him
as
an
adult
member
of
the
commonwealth
this
is
why
was
called
felony
and
as
such
involved
forfeiture
of
goods
calchas
would
not
permit
the
body
of
the
mad
ajax
who
died
by
his
own
hand
to
be
burned
and
the
christian
church
of
refuses
to
bury
in
consecrated
ground
with
religious
rites
any
person
who
deliberately
cuts
short
the
thread
of
his
existence
and
thus
commits
treason
against
the
most
high
the
athenians
ignominiously
lopped
off
the
hand
of
a
suicide
and
buried
the
guilty
instrument
of
his
death
as
an
accursed
thing
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
interred
or
incremated
body
in
some
communities
all
persons
over
sixty
years
of
age
have
been
left
free
to
kill
themselves
if
they
wished
to
do
so
they
had
performed
the
duties
of
citizenship
and
of
procreation
and
were
permitted
to
retire
in
this
way
if
they
saw
fit
in
very
ancient
times
the
magistrates
of
massalia
marseilles
then
a
greek
colony
are
said
to
have
kept
on
hand
a
supply
of
poison
to
be
given
to
any
citizen
who
on
due
examination
was
found
to
have
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
taking
his
own
life
suicide
was
thus
legalized
and
facilitated
and
thereby
rendered
honourable
and
was
perhaps
found
more
convenient
and
economical
than
to
grant
pensions
or
to
support
paupers
it
was
a
summary
method
of
getting
rid
of
those
who
had
finished
the
struggle
for
existence
or
failed
in
it
and
in
either
case
might
be
a
burden
to
themselves
or
to
the
state
on
the
other
hand
when
a
suicidal
mania
seized
upon
the
maidens
of
miletos
an
ionian
city
in
caria
and
threatened
to
produce
a
dearth
of
wives
and
mothers
the
municipal
authorities
decreed
that
the
bodies
of
all
such
persons
should
be
exposed
naked
in
the
in
order
that
virgin
modesty
and
shame
might
overcome
the
desire
of
death
and
check
a
passion
extremely
detrimental
to
the
milesian
commonwealth
it
is
true
as
blackstone
asserts
that
the
church
claimed
deodands
as
her
due
and
put
the
price
of
them
into
her
own
coffers
but
this
fact
does
not
explain
their
origin
they
were
an
expression
of
the
same
feeling
that
led
the
public
authorities
to
fill
up
a
well
in
which
a
person
had
been
drowned
not
as
a
precautionary
measure
but
as
a
solemn
act
of
expiation
or
that
condemned
and
confiscated
a
ship
which
by
lurching
had
thrown
a
man
overboard
and
caused
his
death
deodands
were
not
abolished
in
england
until
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
with
the
exception
of
some
vestiges
of
primitive
legislation
still
lingering
in
maritime
law
they
are
in
modern
codes
one
of
the
latest
applications
of
a
penal
principle
which
in
athens
expatriated
stocks
and
stones
and
in
other
countries
of
europe
excommunicated
bugs
and
sent
beasts
to

a
striking
and
significant
indication
of
the
remarkable
change
that
has
come
over
the
spirit
of
legislation
and
more
especially
of
criminal
jurisprudence
in
comparatively
recent
times
is
the
fact
that
whereas
a
few
generations
ago
lawgivers

courts

justice
still
continued
to
treat
brutes
as
men
responsible
for
their
misdeeds
and
to
punish
them
capitally
as
malefactors
the
tendency
is
to
regard
men
as
brutes
acting
automatically
or
under
an
insane
and
irresistible
impulse
to
evil
and
to
plead
this
innate
and
constitutional
proclivity
in
prosecution
for
murder
as
an
extenuating
or
even
wholly
exculpating
circumstance
some
persons
even
maintain
as
we
have
already
seen
that
such
criminals
are
diabolically
possessed
and
thus
account
for
their
inveterate
and
otherwise
incredible
perversity
on
the
theory
held
by
the
highest
authorities
in
the
middle

the

clad

resembling

adorned
with
a
chestnut

cut
off

substituted

thus
produced
was

transmogrified
wolf
was
stuffed
and
preserved
in

as

proof
of
the
existence
of
in
hungary
and
the
slavic
countries
of
eastern
europe
the
public
execution
of
vampires
was
formerly
of
frequent
occurrence
and
the
superstition
which
gave
rise
to
such
proceedings
still
prevails
among
the
rural
population
of
those
lands
in
a
herdsman
near
the
town
of
cadan
came
forth
from
his
grave
every
night
visiting
the
villages
terrifying
the
inhabitants
conversing
affably
with
some
and
murdering
others
every
person
with
whom
he
associated
was
doomed
to
die
within
eight
days
and
to
wander
as
a
vampire
after
death
in
order
to
keep
him
in
his
grave
a
stake
was
driven
through
his
body
but
he
only
laughed
at
this
clumsy
attempt
to
impale
a
ghost
saying
you
have
really
rendered
me
a
great
service
by
providing
me
with
a
staff
with
which
to
ward
off
the
dogs
when
i
go
out
to
at
length
it
was
decided
to
give
him
over
to
two
public
executioners
to
be
burned
we
are
informed
that
when
the
fire
began
to
take
effect
he
drew
up
his
feet
bellowed
for
a
while
like
a
bull
and
like
an
ass
until
one
of
the
executioners
stabbed
him
in
the
side
so
that
the
blood
oozed
out
and
the
evil
finally
again
in
in
the
town
of
lewin
a
potter
s
wife
who
was
reputed
to
be
a
witch
died
and
owing
to
suspicions
of
her
pact
with
satan
was
refused
burial
in
consecrated
ground
and
dumped
into
a
ditch
like
a
dog
the
event
proved
that
she
was
not
a
good
christian
for
instead
of
remaining
quietly
in
her
grave
such
as
it
was
she
roamed
about
in
the
form
of
divers
unclean
beasts
causing
much
terror
and
slaying
sundry
persons
thereupon
she
was
exhumed
and
it
was
found
that
she
had
chewed
and
swallowed
one
half
of
her
which
on
being
pulled
out
of
her
throat
showed
stains
of
blood
a
stake
was
driven
through
her
breast
but
this
precautionary
measure
only
made
matters
worse
she
now
walked
abroad
with
the
stake
in
her
hand
and
killed
quite
a
number
of
people
with
this
formidable
weapon
she
was
then
taken
up
a
second
time
and
burned
whereupon
she
ceased
from
troubling
the
efficacy
of
this
da
was
accepted
as
conclusive
proof
that
her
neighbours
had
neglected
to
perform
their
whole
religious
duty
in
not
having
burned
her
when
she
was
alive
and
were
thus
punished
for
their
remissness
döpler
cites
also
the
case
of
stephen
hübner
of
trautenau
who
wandered
about
after
death
as
a
vampire
frightening
and
strangling
several
individuals
by
order
of
the
court
his
body
was
disinterred
and
decapitated
under
the
when
his
head
was
struck
off
a
stream
of
blood
spurted
forth
although
he
had
been
already
five
months
buried
his
remains
were
reduced
to
ashes
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
him
in
the
parliament
of
dôle
published
a
decree
permitting
the
inhabitants
of
the
franche
comté
to
pursue
and
kill
a
or
which
infested
that
province
notwithstanding
the
existing
laws
concerning
the
chase
the
people
were
empowered
to
assemble
with
javelins

pikes
arquebuses
and
clubs
to
hunt
and
pursue
the
said
in
all
places
where
they
could
find
it
and
to
take
bind
and
kill
it
without
incurring
any
fine
or
other
the
hunt
seems
to
have
been
successful
if
we
may
judge
from
the
fact
that
the
same
tribunal
in
the
following
year
condemned
to
be
burned
a
man
named
gilles
garnier
who
ran
on
all

in
the
forest
and
fields
and
devoured
little
children
even
on
the
poor

appears
had
as
slight
respect
for

had

four
centuries
in

worshipped
as

succeeded

exhumed
and
brought
to
trial
on
the
charge
of
having
unlawfully
and
sacrilegiously
usurped

papal
dignity
a

was
issued
in
due
form
and
the
corpse
of
the
octogenarian
pope
which
had
lain
already
eight
months
in
the
grave
was
dug
up
in
full
pontificals
and
seated
on
a
throne
in
the
of
peter

where
a
synod
had
been
convened
to
adjudicate
upon
the
case
no
legal
formality
was
omitted
in
this
strange
procedure
and
a
deacon
was
appointed
to
defend
the
accused
although
the
synodical
jury
was
known
to
be
packed
and
the
verdict
predetermined

was
found
guilty
and
condemned
to
deposition
no

was
the
sentence

of
the
childishness
of
prosecuting
inanimate
objects

it
never
violated
the
sepulchre
for
the
purpose
of
inflicting
punishment
on
corpses
the
perpetration
of
this
brutality
was
reserved
for
the
papal
see
from
the
standpoint
of
ancient
and
mediæval
jurisprudents
the
overt
act
alone
was
assumed
to
constitute
the
crime
the
mental
condition
of
the
criminal
was
never
or
at
least
very
seldom
taken
into
consideration
it
is
remarkable
how
long
this
crude
and
superficial
conception
of
justice
prevailed
and
how
very
recently
even
the
first
attempts
have
been
made
to
establish
penal
codes
on
a
philosophic
basis
the
punishableness
of
an
offence
is
now
generally
recognized
as
depending
solely
upon
the
sanity
and
rationality
of
the
offender
crime
morally
and
legally
considered
presupposes
not
perfect
for
such
a
thing
does
not
exist
but
normal
freedom
of
the
will
on
the
part
of
the
agent
where
this
element
is
wanting
there
is
no
culpability
whatever
may
have
been
the
consequences
of
the
act
modern
criminal
law
looks
primarily
to
the
psychical
origin
of
the
deed
and
only
secondarily
to
its
physical
effects
mediæval
criminal
law
ignored
the
origin
altogether
and
regarded
exclusively
the
effects
which
it
dealt
with
on
the
homœopenal
principle
of

the

of

of

and

drawn
nice
and

distinctions
in
determining
degrees
of
personal

judicial
procedure
no
longer
stops
with
testimony
establishing
the
bald
facts
in
the
case

admits
also
the
evidence

in

to
ascertain
to
what
extent
the
will
of
the
accused
was

it

a
question
of

madness
or
of
drivelling
idiocy
perceptible
to

coarsest
understanding
and
the
crassest
ignorance
but
the
slightest
morbid
disturbance
impairing
the
full
and

exercise
of
the
mental
faculties
must
be
examined
and
estimated
if
privation
of
mind
and
irresistible
force
says
zupetta
are
exculpatory
then
partial
vitiation
of
mind
and
force
are
entitled
to
the
same
or
at
least
to
proportional
consideration
there
are
states
of
being
which
are
mutually
contradictory
and
exclusive
and
can
not
such
as
life
and

a
partial
state
of

or
death
is
impossible
such
expressions
as
and
are
hyperbolical
figures
of
speech
used
for
purely
rhetorical
purposes
taken
literally
they
are
simply
absurd
it
is
not
so
however
with
states
of
mind
the
intellect
whose
soundness
is
the
first
condition
of
accountability
may
be
perfectly
clear
manifesting
itself
in
all
its
fulness
and
power
or
it
may
be
partially
obscured
so
too
the
will
whose
is
the
second
condition
of
accountability
may
assert
itself
with
complete
freedom
and
untrammelled
force
or
it
may
act
under
stress
and
with
imperfect
volition
moral
coercion
whether
arising
from
external
influences
abnormities
of
the
physical
organism
or
defects
of
the
mental
constitution
is
not
less
real
because
it
is
not
easy
to
detect
and
may
not
be
wholly
irresistible
for
this
reason
it
involves
no
contradiction
in
terms
and
is
not
absurd
to
call
an
action
or
partial
vitiation
of
mind
is
a
state
distinctly
recognized
in
psychiatrical
science
in
like
manner
there
is
no
essential
incongruity
in
affirming
that
an
impulse
may
be
the
result
of
a
but
these
mental
conditions
and
forces
do
not
manifest
themselves
with
equal
obviousness
and
intensity
in
all
cases
sometimes
they
are
scarcely
appreciable
again
they
verge
upon
absolute
privation
of
mind
and
wholly
irresistible
force
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
judge
to
adjust
the
penalty
to
the
gradations
of
guilt
as
determined
by
the
greater
or
less
freedom
of
the
agent
the
same
process
of
reasoning
would
lead
to
the
admission
of
of
mind
and
forces
as
grounds
of
exculpation
thus
one
might
go
on
analyzing
and
refining
away
human
responsibility
and
reducing
all
crime
to
resultants
of
mental
derangement
until
every
malefactor
would
come
to
be
looked
upon
not
as
a
culprit
to
be
delivered
over
to
the
sharp
stroke
of
the
headsman
or
the
safe
custody
of
the
jailer
but
as
an
unfortunate
victim
of
morbid
states
and
uncontrollable
impulses
to
be
consigned
to
the
sympathetic
care
of
the
psychiater
italian
anthropologists
and
jurisprudents
have
been
foremost
and
gone
farthest
both
theoretically
and
practically
in
this
reaction
from
mediæval
conceptions
of
crime
and
its
proper
punishment
this
violent
recoil
from
extreme
cruelty
to
excessive
commiseration
is
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
italian
temperament
to
a
peculiar
gentleness
and
impressionableness
of
character
which
combined
with
an
instinctive
aversion
to
whatever
shocks
the
senses
and
mars
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
are
apt
to
degenerate
into
shallow
sentimentality
and
sickly
sensibility
thereby
enfeebling
and
perverting
the
moral
sense
and
distorting
all
ideas
of
right
and
justice
to
minds
thus
constituted
the
cool
and
deliberate
condemnation
of
a
human
being
to
the
gallows
is
an
atrocity
in
comparison
with
which
a
fatal
stab
in
the
heat
of
passion
or
under
strong
provocation
seems
a
light
and
venial
transgression
this
maudlin
sympathy
with
the
guilty
living
man
who
is
in
danger
of
suffering
for
his
crime
to
the
entire
forgetfulness
of
the
innocent
dead
man
the
victim
of
his
anger
or
cupidity
pervades
all
classes
of
society
and
has
stimulated
the
ingenuity
of
lawyers
and
legislators
to
discover
mitigating
moments
and
extenuating
circumstances
and
other
means
of
loosening
and
enlarging
the
intricate
meshes
of
the
penal
code
so
as
to
permit
the
culprit
to
escape
to
this
end
they
eagerly
seized
upon
the
doctrine
of
evolution
and
endeavoured
to
seek
the
origin
of
crime
in
hereditary
propensities
atavistic
recurrences
physical
degeneracies
and
other
organic
fatalities
for
which
no
one
can
be
held
personally
responsible
and
constructed
upon
the
basis
of
the
most
recent
scientific
researches
a
penological
system
giving
free
scope
and
full
gratification
to
this
pitying
and
palliating
disposition
but
although
the
italians
have
been
pioneers
in
this
movement
it
has
not
been
confined
to
them
it
extends
to
all
civilized
nations
and
expresses
a
general
tendency
of
the
age
even
the
germans
those
leaders
in
theory
and
laggards
in
practice
whose
studies
and
speculations
have
illustrated
all
forms
and
phases
of
judicial
procedure
but
who
adhere
so
conservatively
to
ancient
methods
and
resist
so
stubbornly
the
tides
of
reform
in
their
own
courts
have
yielded
on
this
point
they
no
longer
regard
insanity
and
idiocy
as
the
only
grounds
of
exemption
from
punishment
but
include
in
the
same
category
all
morbid
disturbances
of
mental
activity
and
all
states
of
mind
in
which
the
free
determination
of
the
will
is
not
indeed
wholly
destroyed
but
only
partially
in
order
to
realize
the
radical
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
this
direction
within
a
relatively
recent
period
it
will
suffice
merely
to
compare
the
present
criminal
code
of
the
german
empire
with
the
austrian
code
of
the
bavarian
code
of
and
the
prussian
code
of
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
these
changes
have
been
effected
under
the
drift
of
public
opinion
in
spite
of
the
political
preponderance
of
prussia
and
her
strong
bureaucratic
influence
which
has
always
been
exerted
in
favour
of
severe
penalties
and
shown
slight
consideration
for
individual
frailties
and
criminal
idiosyncrasies
in
inflicting
punishment
as
the
stronghold
of
a
stolid
and
supercilious
squirearchy
junkerthum
in
germany
prussia
has
stubbornly
resisted
to
the
last
every
reformatory
movement
in
civil
and
social
and
especially
in
criminal
legislation
a
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
german
empire
pronounced
in
the
summer
of
seems
to
put
a
check
upon
this
tendency
by
rejecting
the
plea
of
moral
insanity
in
the
extenuation
of
crime
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
question
whether
such
a
state
of
mind
as
moral
insanity
exists
or
can
exist
has
not
yet
been
settled
and
so
long
as
psychiaters
do
not
agree
as
to
the
actuality
or
possibility
of
this
anomalous
mental
condition
courts
of
justice
may
very
properly
refuse
to
take
it
into
consideration
or
to
allow
it
to
exert
the
slightest
influence
upon
their
judgment
in
the
infliction
of
judicial
punishment
moral
insanity
as
usually
defined
involves
a
disturbance
of
the
moral
perceptions
and
a
derangement
of
the
emotional
nature
without
impairing
the
distinctively
intellectual
faculties
the
supposed
victim
of
this
hypothetical
form
of
madness
is
capable
of
thinking
logically
and
often
shows
remarkable
astuteness
in
forming
his
plans
and
executing
his
criminal
purposes
but
seems
utterly
destitute
of
the
moral
sense
and
of
all
the
finer
feelings
of
humanity
performing
the
most
atrocious
deeds
without
hesitation
and
remembering
them
without
the
slightest
compunction
in
moral
stolidity
and
the
lack
of
susceptibility
he
is
on
a
level
with
the
lowest
savage
german
psychiaters
on
the
whole
are
inclined
to
regard
such
persons
not
as
morally
insane
but
as
morally
degenerate
and
depraved
and
german
jurists
and
judges
are
not
disposed
to
admit
such
vitiation
of
character
as
an
extenuating
circumstance
especially
at
a
time
when
criminals
of
this
class
are
on
the
increase
and
are
banded
together
to
overthrow
civilized
society
and
to
introduce
an
era
of
anarchy
and
barbarism
the
decision
of
the
german
judicatory
is
therefore
not
reactionary
but
merely
precautionary
and
simply
indicates
a
wise
determination
to
keep
the
administration
of
criminal
law
unencumbered
by
theories
which
science
has
not
yet
fully
established
and
which
at
present
can
only
serve
to
paralyze
the
arm
of
retributive
justice
mediæval
penal
justice
sought
to
inflict
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
suffering
on
the
offender
and
showed
a
diabolical
fertility
of
invention
in
devising
new
methods
of
torture
even
for
the
pettiest
trespasses
the
monuments
of
this
barbarity
may
now
be
seen
in
european
museums
in
the
form
of
racks
thumbkins
interlarded
hares
pomeranian
bonnets
spanish
boots
scavenger
s
daughters
iron
virgins
and
similar
engines
of
cruelty
until
quite
recently
an
iron
virgin
with
its
interior
full
of
long
and
sharp
spikes
was
exhibited
in
a
subterranean
passage
at
nuremberg
on
the
very
spot
where
it
is
supposed
to
have
once
performed
its
horrible
functions
and
in
munich
this
inhuman
instrument
of
punishment
was
in
actual
use
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
criminal
code
of
maria
theresa
published
in
contained
large
copperplate
engravings
illustrating
the
various
modes
of
torture
prescribed
in
the
text
for
the
purpose
of
extorting
confession
and
evidently
designed
to
serve
as
object
lessons
for
the
instruction
of
the
tormentor
and
the
intimidation
of
the
accused
that
prussia
was
the
first
country
in
germany
to
abolish
judicial
torture
was
due
not
to
the
progressive
spirit
of
the
nation
or
of
its
tribunals
but
solely
to
the
superior
enlightenment
and
energy
of
frederic
the
great
who
effected
this
reform
arbitrarily
and
against
the
will
of
jurists
and
judges
by
issued
in
and
crimes
which
women
are
under
peculiar
temptation
to
commit
were
punished
with
extraordinary
severity
thus
the
infanticide
was
buried
alive
a
small
tube
communicating
with
the
outer
air
being
placed
in
her
mouth
in
order
to
prolong
her
life
and
her
agony
a
case
of
this
kind
is
recorded
in
the
proceedings
of
the
or
criminal
court
of
ensisheim
in
alsatia
under
the
date
of
february
in
an
apprentice
who
stole
from
his
master
five
pfennigs
then
as
now
the
smallest
coin
of
germany
and
worth
about
the
fifth
of
a
cent
was
condemned
to
have
both
his
ears
cut
off
incredible
barbarities
of
this
kind
were
practised
by
some
of
the
best
and
noblest
men
of
that
age
thus
cardinal
carlo
borromeo
who
was
among
his
contemporaries
for
the
purity
of
his
life
and
the
benevolence
of
his
character
did
not
hesitate
to
condemn
fra
tommaso
di
mileto
a
franciscan
monk
to
be
walled
up
alive
because
he
entertained
heretical
notions
concerning
the
sinfulness
of
eating
meat
on
friday
and
expressed
doubts
touching
the
worship
of
images
indulgences
the
supreme
and
infallible
authority
of
the
pope
and
the
real
presence
in
the
eucharist
this
cruel
sentence
a
striking
illustration
of
the
words
of
lucretius
tantum
religio
potuit
suadere
malorum
was
pronounced
december
as
follows
i
condemn
you
to
be
walled
up
in
a
place
enclosed
by
four
walls
where
with
anguish
of
heart
and
abundance
of
tears
you
shall
bewail
your
sins
and
grievous
offences
committed
against
the
majesty
of
god
and
the
holy
mother
church
and
the
religion
of
francis
the
founder
of
your
a
bishop
who
should
impose
such
a
punishment
would
be
very
properly
declared
insane
and
divested
of
his
office
much
ridicule
has
been
cast
upon
the
blue
laws
of
connecticut
on
account
of
the
narrowness
and
pettiness
of
their
prevailing
spirit
from
our
present
point
of
view
they
are
absurd
and
in
many
respects
atrocious
but
compared
with
the
penal
codes
of
that
time
they
mark
a
great
advance
in
human
legislation
they
reduced
the
number
of
crimes
then
punishable
in
england
by
death
from
two
hundred
and
to
fourteen
in
the
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
counterfeiters
and
issuers
of
false
coin
were
condemned
to
be
boiled
to
death
in
oil
by
slow
degrees
the
culprit
was
suspended
over
the
cauldron
and
gradually
let
down
into
it
first
boiling
the
feet
then
the
legs
and
so
on
until
all
the
flesh
was
separated
from
the
bones
and
the
body
reduced
to
a
skeleton
the
puritans
of
new
england
relentless
as
they
were
in
their
dealings
with
sectaries
were
never
so
ruthless
as
this
nor
is
it
probable
that
they
would
have
inflicted
capital
punishment
upon
their
own
stubborn
and
rebellious
sons
or
upon
persons
who
worship
any
other
god
but
the
lord
god
had
it
not
been
for
precedents
recorded
in
laws
enacted
by
a
people
thousands
of
years
ago
and
supposed
to
have
been
dictated
by
divine
wisdom
they
failed
to
perceive
the
incongruity
of
attempting
to
rear
a
democratic
commonwealth
on
theocratic
foundations
and
made
the
fatal
mistake
of
planning
their
structure
after
what
they
regarded
as
the
perfect
model
of
the
jewish
zion
if
we
compare
these
barbarities
with
the
law
recently
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
whereby
capital
punishment
is
to
be
inflicted
as
quickly
and
painlessly
as
possible
by
means
of
electricity
we
shall
be
able
to
appreciate
the
immense
difference
between
the
mediæval
and
the
modern
spirit
in
the
conception
and
execution
of
penal
justice
a
point
of
practical
importance
which
the
criminal
anthropologist
has
to
consider
is
the
relation
of
moral
to
penal
responsibility
if
there
is
no
freedom
of
the
will
and
the
commission
of
crime
is
the
necessary
result
of
physiological
idiosyncrasies
hereditary
predispositions
brachycephalous
dolichocephalous
or
microcephalous
peculiarities
anomalies
of
cerebral
convolution
or
other
anatomical
asymmetries
over
which
the
individual
has
no
control
and
by
which
his
destiny
is
determined
then
he
is
certainly
not
morally
responsible
for
his
conduct
but
is
he
on
this
account
to
be
exempt
from
punishment
the
vast
majority
of
criminalists
answer
this
question
unhesitatingly
in
the
negative
declaring
that
penal
legislation
is
independent
of
metaphysical
opinion
and
that
punishment
is
proper
and
imperative
so
far
as
it
is
essential
to
the
protection
and
preservation
of
society
if
the
infliction
of
the
penalties
depriving
a
man
of
his
freedom
or
his
life
is
found
to
secure
these
ends
it
is
the
duty
of
the
tribunals
established
for
the
administration
of
justice
to
impose
them
without
troubling
themselves
about
the
mental
condition
of
the
culprit
or
stopping
to
discuss
problems
which
belong
to
the
province
of
the
psychiater
legal
tribunals
are
not
offices
in
which
candidates
for
the
insane
asylum
are
examined
or
certificates
of
admission
to
reformatories
issued
but
are
organized
as
a
terror
to
in
the
general
interests
of
society
and
all
their
decisions
should
have
this
object
in
view
if
a
madman
is
not
hanged
for
murder
it
is
solely
because
such
a
procedure
would
exert
no
deterring
influence
upon
other
madmen
society
protects
itself
in
cases
of
this
kind
by
depriving
the
dangerous
individual
of
his
liberty
and
thus
preventing
him
from
doing
harm
but
it
has
no
right
to
inflict
upon
him
wanton
and
superfluous
suffering
even
if
it
should
be
deemed
desirable
to
kill
him
the
method
of
his
removal
should
be
such
as
to
cause
the
least
possible
pain
and
publicity
here
too
the
welfare
of
society
is
the
determinative
factor
this
doctrine
reduces
confirmed
criminals
to
the
condition
of
ferocious
beasts
and
venomous
reptiles
and
logically
demands
that
they
should
be
eliminated
for
precisely
the
same
reason
that
noxious
animals
are
exterminated
although
neither
the
human
nor
the
animal
creatures
are
to
blame
for
the
perniciousness
of
their
inborn
proclivities
and
natural
instincts
in
the
eyes

a
kind
of
menagerie
naquet
the
french
chemist
and
senator
goes
still
farther
declaring
that
men
are
no
more
culpable
for
being
criminal
than
vitriol
is
for
being
corrosive
and
adding
that
it
is
our
own
fault
if
we
put
this
stuff
into
our
tea
and
are
poisoned
by
it
the
same
writer
maintains
that
there
is
no
more
demerit
in
being
perverse
than
in
being
or
in
a
recent
lecture
on
criminal
jurisprudence
and
biology
professor
benedikt
cites
the
case
of
a
moravian
robber
and
murderer
whose
brain
was
found
on
dissection
to
resemble
that
of
a
beast
of
prey
and
who
was
therefore
in
the
opinion
of
the
eminent
viennese
authority
no
more
responsible
for
his
bloody
deeds
than
is
a
lion
or
a
tiger
for
its
ravages
the
corollary
to
this
anatomical
demonstration
is
that
one
should
treat
such
a
man
as
a
lion
or
a
tiger
and
shoot
him
on
the
spot
atavistic
relapses
defective
cerebral
development
and
other
abnormities
undoubtedly
occur
in
criminals
whose
acts
may
be
traced
in
some
degree
to
these
physical
imperfections
and
therefore
be
pathologically
stimulated
and
partially
necessitated
by
them
on
the
other
hand
there
are
thousands
of
persons
with
equally
small
and
unsymmetrical
craniums

do
not
commit

lombroso
discovers
in
habitual
malefactors
a
tendency
to
tattoo
their
bodies
but
this
kind
of
cuticular
ornamentation
indicates
merely
a
low
development
of
the
æsthetic
sense
a
barbarous
conception
of
the
beautiful
or
what
would
be
called
bad
taste
and
has
not
the
slightest
genetic
or
symptomatic
connection
with
crime
and
the
proclivity
to
perpetrate
it
as
a
means
of
embellishing
the
exterior
man
it
may
be
rude
and
unrefined
but
after
all
it
is
only
and
does
not
extend
to
the
moral
character
honest
people
of
the
lower
classes
take
pleasure
in
disfiguring
themselves
in
this
way
and
soldiers
and
sailors
who
are
very
far
from
furnishing
the
largest
percentage
of
criminals
are
especially
addicted
to
it
simply
because
they
find
ample
leisure
in
the
barracks
and
the
forecastle
to
undergo
this
slow
and
painful
process
of
what
they
deem
adornment
according
to
lombroso
criminals
have
as
a
rule
thick
heads
of
hair
and
thin
beards
but
as
the
majority
of
them
are
comparatively
young
these
phenomena
are
by
no
means
remarkable
he
has
also
found
that
the
hair
of
such
persons
is
usually
black
or
dark
chestnut
had
his
investigations
been
carried
on
in
norway
and
sweden
instead
of
in
italy
he
would
have
certainly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
flaxen
hair
is
an
index
of
a
criminal
character
it
would
be
difficult
to
deny
the
existence
of
a
constitutionally
criminal
class
a
persistently
perverse
element
which
is
the
born
foe
of
all
law
and
order
at
war
with
every
form
of
social
and
political
organization
and
whose
permanent
attitude
of
mind
is
that
of
the
irishman

anthropologists
have
been

earnest
in
their
endeavours
to
define
this
pernicious
type
and
to
determine
the
physiological
and
physiognomical
features
which
characterize
and
constitute
it
this
line
of
research
is
unquestionably
in
the
right
direction
but
as
a
reaction
against
barren
scholastic
speculations
and
brutal
penal
codes
has
been
carried
to
excess
by
enthusiastic
specialists
and
led
to
broad
generalizations
and
hasty
deductions
from
insufficient
data
taine

definition
of

as
an

that

the
vicious

as

are
the
resultants
of
race

environment

other
and
influences
and
agencies
to
which
the

did
not
voluntarily
subject
himself
and
from
which
he
can
not
escape
the
acts
therefore
which
he
performs
whether
good
or
evil
are
as
independent
of
his
will
as
the
colour
of
his
hair
or
the
shape
of
his
nose
for
while
they
are
apparently
volitional
impulses
the
will
itself
from
which
they
seem
to
proceed
is
determined
by
forces
as
fixed
and
free
from
his
control
as
are
those
which
render
him
or
the
penological
application
of
this
philosophical
principle
has
given
rise
to
numerous
theories
concerning
the
nature
and
origin
of

lombroso
and
his
disciples
as
we
have
already
intimated
attribute
it
to
atavism
or
the
survival
in
the
individual
of
the
animal
instincts
and
low
morals
of
the
aboriginal
barbarian
the
criminal
is
simply
a
savage
let
loose
in
a
civilized
community
and
ignoring
the
ethical
conceptions
developed
by
ages
of
culture
and
performing
actions
that
would
have
seemed
perfectly
proper
and
praiseworthy
in
the
eyes
of
our
ancestors
the
hero
of
the
palæolithic
age
is
the
brigand
and
of
the
criminal
type
is
nothing
but
a
reversion
to
the
primitive
type
of
the
race
and
the
representatives
of
this
school
of
anthropologists
have
been
untiring
in
their
efforts
to
discover
physical
and
moral
characteristics
common
to
both
long
arms
like
chimpanzees
four
circumvolutions
of
the
frontal
lobes
of
the
brain
like
the
large
carnivora
small
cranial
capacity
like
the
canine
teeth
like
anthropoid
apes
and
a
simian
nose
this
analogy
extends
to
the
eyes
the
ears
the
hair
and
even
to
the
internal
organs
the
liver
the
heart
and
the
stomach
and
the
diseases
by
which
they
are
affected
it
has
also
been
observed
that
assassins
are
brachycephalous
and

dolichocephalous
marro
maintains
that
in
many
cases
metaphors
express
real
facts
and
embody
the
common
conclusions
of
mankind
based
upon
centuries
of
observation
swindlers
have
a
foxy
look
persons
are
naturally
thievish
whereas
a
fellow
is
pretty
sure
to
have
a
pugnacious
disposition
and
to
be
a
born
rough
nevertheless
social
surroundings
educational
influences
and
other
outward
circumstances
are
important
factors
not
so
much
in
changing
the
character
as
in
giving
it
direction
the
same
cerebral
constitution
and
consequent
innate
predisposition
may
make
a
man
a
hero
or
a
bravo
a
dashing
soldier
like
phil
sheridan
or
a
daring
robber
like
fra
diavolo
according
to
the
place
of
his
birth
and
the
nature
of
his
environment
in
common
discourse
we
speak
of
atrabiliary
spleeny
choleric
or
even
stomachous
persons
but
such
expressions
are
in
most
cases
survivals
of
antiquated
beliefs
concerning
the
functions
of
certain
physical
organs
hypochondria
has
no
more
originary
connection
with
the
cartilage
of
the
breastbone
than
with
the
cartilage
of
the
ear
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
terms
a
man
is
not
necessarily
of
superior
intellectual
power
any
more
than
a
man
is
naturally
generous
or
a
man
instinctively
grasping
so
too
the
theory
that
intelligence
and
morality
are
in
direct
proportion
to
the
size
and
symmetry
of
the
encephalon
is
not
sustained
by
facts
at
least
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
are
so
many
and
so
remarkable
as
to
render
it
extremely
misleading
and
therefore
of
little
practical
value
as
a
scientific
principle
gambetta
s
brain
for
example
weighed
only
grammes
being
grammes
less
in
weight
than
that
of
the
average
parisian
and
was
so
abnormally
irregular
in
its
configuration
as
to
seem
actually
deformed
any
physiologist
says
manouvrier
who
should
come
across
such
a
skull
in
a
museum
would
unhesitatingly
pronounce
it
to
be
that
of
a
savage
the

of

in
the
posterior
part
a
supplementary
fold
said
by
some
to
be
the
organ
of
speech
and
by
others
to
be
the
organ
of
theft
perhaps
both
combined
in
the
ability
of
the
orator
to
steal
away
men
s
hearts
as
antony
says
of
the
seductive
eloquence
of
brutus
the
distinguished
physiologist
bichat
was
an
ardent
advocate
of
this
doctrine
of
the
causal
connection
between
cranial
capacity
and
symmetry
and
vigorous
and
mental
faculties
but
after
his
death
his
own
cranium
was
found
to
be
conspicuously
lacking
in
the
very
characteristics
which
he
deemed
so
essential
to
man
as
a
moral
and
intellectual
being
the
late
german
professor
bischoff
based
his
argument
against
the
higher
education
of
woman
on
the
fact
that
the
average
female
brain
weighs
only
grammes
and
asserted
that
a
person
with
such
a
light
encephalon
must
be
organically
incompetent
to
master
the
various
branches
of
study
taught
in
our
universities
a
examination
proved
his
own
brain
to
be
considerably
inferior
in
weight
to
that
of
the
average
woman
careful
investigations
would
doubtless
furnish
additional
examples
of
this
comical
application
of
the
ad
in
refutation
of
the
notion
that
intellectual
capacity
is
determined
by
the
bulk
of
the

or
the
shape
of

skull
ugo
foscolo
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
modern
italian
poets

a
cranium
which
according
to
this
standard
of
appreciation
ought
to
have
belonged
to
an
idiot
on
the
other
hand
the
brain
of
the
hottentot
venus
examined
by
gratiolet

surpassed
in
the
symmetry
of
both
hemispheres
and
the
perfection
of
its
circumvolutions
the
normal
brains
of
the
caucasian
race
the
same
phenomenon
has
been
observed
although
in
a
less
striking
manner
occasionally
in
cretins
and
quite
often
in
criminals
character
is
the
resultant
of
a
multitude
of
combined
forces
the
great
majority
of
which
are
still
unknown
and
perhaps
unknowable
quantities
the
impulse
given
by
each
must
be
exactly
estimated
in
order
to
predetermine
the
joint
effect
no
factor
which
contributes
to
its
formation
must
be
overlooked
and
the
acceptance
of
any
one
of
them
however
important
it
may
seem
to
be
as
the
basis
on
which
to
reform
and
reconstruct
our
penal
legislation
would
be
premature
and
pernicious
this
tendency
which
is
the
vice
of
every
specialist
is
now
the
besetting
sin
of
criminal
anthropologists
each
of
whom
is
firmly
convinced
that
he
can
reach
the
goal
only
on
his
own
garran
the
more
advanced
criminalists
says
professor
von
kirchenheim
are
becoming
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
penal
codes
of
do
not
correspond
to
the
criminal
world
of
no
science
has
remained
so
deeply
rooted
and
grounded
in
scholasticism
as
jurisprudence
and
this
evil
is
most
clearly
perceptible
in
the
province
of
criminal
law
the
necessity
of
a
change
in
our
penal
legislation
has
already
made
itself
widely
felt
the
contest
with
crime
must
now
be
carried
on
in
a
different
manner
from
what
it
was
when
men
waged
war
with
bows
and
arrows
modern
criminality
must
be
fought
as
it
were
with
repeating
in
other
words
we
can
never
suppress
crime
by
meeting
it
with
bludgeons
and
boomerangs
and
other
rude
implements
of
barbarous
warfare
but
must
encounter
it
with
the
finest
and
most
effective
weapons
of
precision
which
the
armoury
of
modern
science
can
put
into
our
hands
society
has
outgrown
the
crude
conception
of
punishment
as
mere
retaliation
or
retribution
incited
by
revenge
there
is
no
doubt
that
even
in
the
most
enlightened
countries
penology
as
a
science
is
still
in
its
infancy
and
is
only
just
beginning
to
feel
the
uncomfortable
girding
of
its
scanty
and
blindly
kicking
itself
free
from
them
that
this
first
emancipatory
effort
should
be
somewhat
clumsy
and
occasionally
attended
by
comical
casualties
and
even
serious
disasters
lies
in
the
very
nature
of
the
case
it
is
evident
too
that
the
antiquated
and
utterly
irrational
methods
now
employed
for
the
suppression
of
crime
tend
directly
to
increase
it
it
is
the
aim
of
the
positive
in
distinction
from
the
classical
school
of
criminalists
to
discover
the
real
causes
of
criminal
actions
and
thus
to
endeavour
to
eradicate
or
neutralize
them
a
casual
criminal
for
example
whom
external
conditions
accidental
circumstances
sudden
temptations
or
bad
influences
have
led
astray
should
not
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
although
guilty
of
the
same
overt
act
as
the
habitual
or
constitutional
criminal
whose
arises
from
a
diseased
or
undeveloped
mental
or
physical
organization
and
is
therefore
an
inborn
and
perhaps
irresistible
proclivity
the
latter
is
hardly
responsible
for
his
conduct
and
the
possibility
of
reforming
him
is
slight
the
only
proper
thing
to
do
with
such
a
culprit
is
to
render
him
personally
harmless
to
society
either
by
death
or
perpetual
incarceration
and
to
prevent
him
from
propagating
his
kind
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
through
selection
suggests
as
its
necessary
sequence
the
suppression
of
the
unfittest
through
sterilization
nature
has
her
own
effective
and
relentless
method
of
attaining
this
desirable
result
but
man
is
constantly
thwarting
her
beneficent
purposes
by
all
sorts
of
pernicious
schemes
originating
in
factitious
sentimentalism
and
maudlin
sympathy
which
under
the
plea
of
philanthropy
tend
to
foster
and
perpetuate
moral
monstrosities
to
the
discomfort
and
detriment
of
civilized
society
and
the
permanent
deterioration
of
the
race
to
sentence
persons
of
this
class
to
eight
or
ten
years
imprisonment
and
then
to
turn
them
loose
again
as
a
constant
source
of
peril
to
mankind
is
the
greatest
folly
that
any
tribunal
can
possibly
commit
it
is
a
wrong
done
both
to
the
criminal
and
to
the
community
of
which
he
is
a
member
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
law
should
be
determined
not
solely
by
the
enormity
of
the
crime
but
chiefly
by
the
character
of
the
criminal
paradoxical
as
such
a
conclusion
may
be
it
is
nevertheless
a
strictly
logical
deduction
from
the
premises
that
the
more
corrupt
he
is
by
his
physical
constitution
and
therefore
the
less
culpable
he
is
from
a
moral
point
of
view
the
more
severe
should
be
the
sentence
pronounced
upon
him
where
the
vicious
propensity
is
in
the
blood
and
beyond
the
reach
of
moral
or
penal
purgations
the
only
safety
is
in
the
elimination
of
the
individual
just
as
the
only
remedy
for
a
gangrened
limb
is
amputation
we
ridicule
ancient
and
mediæval
courts
of
justice
for
prosecuting
bugs
and
beasts
but
future
generations
will
condemn
as
equally
absurd
and
outrageous
our
judicial
treatment
of
human
beings
who
can
no
more
help
perpetrating
deeds
of
violence
under
given
conditions
than
locusts
and
caterpillars
can
help
consuming
crops
to
the
injury
of
the
husbandman
or
wild
beasts
can
help
rending
and
devouring
their
prey
it
is
also
interesting
to
know
that
in
former
times
the
animal
was
not
punished
capitally
because
it
was
supposed
to
have
incurred
guilt
but
as
a
memorial
of
the
occurrence
or
in
the
language
of
canonical
law
propter
culpam
sed
propter
memoriam
facti
pecus
it
was
put
to
death
not
because
it
was
culpable
but
because
it
was
harmful
and
this
is
the
ground
on
which
the
radical
wing
of
criminal
anthropologists
would
repress
and
eliminate
a
vicious
person
without
regard
to
his
mental
soundness
or
moral
responsibility
to
use
garofalo
s
metaphor
he
is
a
microbe
injurious
to
the
social
organism
and
must
be
destroyed
lombroso
carries
his
theory
of
the
innateness
hereditability
and
ineradicableness
of
criminal
propensities
so
far
as
to
affirm
that
education
can
not
change
those
who
are
born
with
perverse
instincts
and
to
despair
of
correcting
an
obstinate
bias
of
this
sort
even
in
a
child
in
accordance
with
this
idea
his
disciple
le
bon
proposes
to
deport
to
distant
countries
all
professional
criminals
or
persistent
relapsers
into
vice
together
with
their
posterity
and
would
thus
practically
revive
the
barbarous
principle
of
visiting
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
although
he
does
not
regard
their
conduct
as
sinful
in
the
sense
of
being
a
voluntary
transgression
of
the
moral
law
but
as
the
result
of
a
transmitted
taint
and
organic
deficiency
for
which
the
individual
is
in
no
wise
responsible
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
this
doctrine
is
not
sustained
by
the
statistics
of
reformatories
houses
of
refuge
and
similar
institutions
which
have
now
taken
the
place
of
the
prison
and
the
scaffold
in
the
case
of
juvenile
offenders
those
who
look
upon
crime
as
a
pathological
phenomenon
find
a
striking
illustration
and
strong
confirmation
of
their
views
in
violations
of
the
law
committed
under
the
impulse
of
hypnotic
suggestion
some
maintain
that
all
acts
originating
in
this
manner
are
purely
automatic
and
acquit
the
person
performing
them
of
all
moral
and
legal
responsibility
since
they
express
the
will
and
purpose
of
the
hypnotizer
who
alone
should
be
held
accountable
others
hold
that
the
man
who
consents
to
be
hypnotized
and
thus
voluntarily
surrenders
his
and
permits
himself
to
be
used
as
an
instrument
for
the
perpetration
of
crime
should
be
punished
for
his
offences
and
not
allowed
to
go
by
pleading
the
of
hypnotic
suggestion
the
liability
to
punishment
it
is
justly
argued
would
be
a
safeguard
to
society
by
putting
a
wholesome
and
effective
check
on
hypnotic
experimentations
there
is
at
least
no
reason
why
the
hypnotized
subject
should
not
be
called
to
account
for
accomplicity
any
passion
may
become
automatic
and
irresistible
by
long
indulgence
and
assiduous
cultivation
so
that
the
man
is
overmastered
by
it
and
can
not
help
yielding
to
it
under
strong
temptation
but
the
victim
of
a
vicious
habit
has
no
right
to
urge
the
force
of
an
evil
propensity
in
exculpation
of
himself
the
inborn
or
inveterate
badness
of
a
man
s
character
may
explain
but
can
not
excuse
his
bad
conduct
in
the
impartial
and
inexorable
eye
of
justice
so
too
he
who
sins
against
his
own
worthiness
and
dignity
as
a
rational
being
by
choosing
to
annul
his
power
of
as
a
voluntary
agent
and
become
a
helpless
tool
in
the
hands
of
another
ought
not
wholly
to
escape
the
consequences
of
his
folly
that
the
hypnotizer
should
be
made
fully
responsible
for
the
realization
of
his
suggestions
no
representative
of
either
the
positive
or
classical
school
of
criminalists
would
probably
deny
to
take
a
man
s
life
by
means
of
hypnotic
suggestion
is
as
truly
subornation
to
murder
as
to
hire
an
assassin
to
plunge
a
dagger
into
his
heart
as
regards
hypnotism
itself
it
would
be
strange
enough
if
we
should
discover
in
it
the
real
scientific
basis
of
witchcraft
and
modern
legislation
should
prosecute
and
punish
hypnotizers
as
mediæval
legislation
prosecuted
and
punished
sorcerers
the
sympathetic
influence
of
a
morbidly
imaginative
mind
upon
the
body
in
directing
the
currents
of
nervous
energy
and
increasing
the
flow
of
blood
towards
particular
points
of
the
physical
organism
so
as
to
produce
stigmata
and
similar
abnormal
phenomena
has
long
been
recognized
as
an
adequate
explanation
of
much
mediæval
and
modern
it
would
now
seem
as
if
hypnotism
or
the
magnetic
influence
of
one
man
s
will
upon
another
man
s
mind
and
body
were
destined
to
furnish
the
key
to
still
greater
marvels

reveal
the
true
nature
and
origin
of
what
has
hitherto
passed
for
divine
inspiration
or

charcot

are

to

as

the
success
of
scientific
research
in
disclosing
the
physical
basis
of
intellectual
life
is
gradually
undermining
the
foundations
of
spiritualism
and
rendering
it
more
and
more
impossible
to
mistake
symptoms
of
chlorosis
and
hysterical
weakness
for

sickly
women
are
no
longer
treated
as
seeresses
and
their
vague
and
incoherent
sayings
treasured
as
oracular
utterances
one
of
the
chief
difficulties
encountered
by
those
who
seek
to
frame
and
administer
penal
laws
on
principles
arises
from
the
fact
that
no
one
has
ever
yet
been
able
to
give
an
exact
and
adequate
definition
of
insanity
however
easy
it
may
be
to
recognize
the
grosser
varieties
of
mental
disorder
it
is
often
impossible
even
for
an
expert
to
detect
it
in
its
subtler
forms
or
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
between
sanity
and
insanity
an
eminent
alienist
affirms
that
very
few
persons
we
meet
in
the
on
the
street
or
in
society
or
with
whom
we
enjoy
pleasant
intercourse
at
their
firesides
are
of
perfectly
sound
mind
nearly
every
one
is
a
little
touched
some
molecule
of
the
brain
has
turned
into
a
maggot
there
is
some
topic
that
can
not
be
introduced
without
making
the
portals
of
the
mind
grate
on
their
golden
hinges
some
point
at
which
we
are
forced
to
say
o
that
way
madness
lies
let
me
shun
it
is
possible
however
that
this
very
opinion
may
be
a
fixed
idea
or
symptomatic
eccentricity
of
the
alienist
himself
the
theory
that
all
men
are
monomaniacs
may
be
merely
his
peculiar
monomania
still
there
is
unquestionably
this
much
truth
in
it
that
nearly
every
person
has
developed
some
faculty
at
the
expense
of
the
others
and
thus
destroyed
his
mental
equilibrium
every
tendency
of
this
kind
which
is
not
checked
or
balanced
and
in
some
way
rounded
off
in
the
growth
of
the
character
becomes
morbidly
strong
and
leads
to
a
sort
of
insanity
the
specialist
is
always
exposed
to
this
danger
of
growing
into
a
man
of
one
idea
his
monomania
may
be
in
the
direction
of
valuable
research
or
in
the
pursuit
of
a
foolish
whim
resulting
in
useful
inventions
or
dissipating
itself
in
chimerical
projects
it
may
be
a
harmless
crotchet
or
a
vicious
proclivity
philanthropic
or
misanthropic
it
is
nevertheless
a
bent
or
bias
and
so
far
a
deviation
from
the
norm
of
perfect
intellectual
rectitude
a
madman
says
coleridge
is
one
who
mistakes
his
thoughts
for
person
and
but
here
the
frenzies
of
the
lunatic
intrench
on
the
functions
of
the
poet
who
of
imagination
all
compact
takes
his
fancies
for
realities
turns
them
to
shapes
and
gives
to
airy
nothing
a
local
habitation
and
a
coleridge
s
definition
includes
also
the
mythopœic
faculty
the
power
of
projecting
creations
of
the
mind
and
endowing
them
with
objective
actuality
and
independent
existence
which
in
the
infancy
of
the
race
peopled
heaven
and
earth
with
phantasms
and
still
croons
over
cradles
and
babbles
of
brownie
and
fairy
in
nurseries
and
no
progress
of
science
can
wholly
eradicate
this
tendency
to
mythologize
in
the
absence
of
better
material
it
seizes
upon
the
most
prosaic
and
practical
improvements
in
modern
household
life
and
clothes
them
with
poetry
and
legend
the
imaginative
child
of
new
york
or
boston
after
feeding
the
mind
on
fairy
tales
converts
the
ordinary
into
the
den
of
a
dragon
which
puts
forth
its
fiery
tongue
when
the
knob
is
turned
the
sleeping
figure
of
a
virgin
carved
in
marble
and
copied
from
an
ancient
greek
sculpture
of
ariadne
which
reposes
on
an
arch

the
park

transformed
by
the

will
awake
as
soon
as
a
horseman
succeeds
in
springing
over
it
three
times
with
his

so

is
the
belief
in
this

that

good
christians
never
pass
through
the
archway
without
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
a
prophylactic
against
possible
demonic
influences
the
suabian

still
believes
that
the
railroad
is
a
device
of
the
devil
who
is
entitled
by
contract
to
a
tollage
of
one
passenger
on
every
train
he
is
in
a
constant
state
of
anxiety
lest
his
turn
may
come
on
the
next
trip
and
always
wears
a
crucifix
as
the
best
means
so
far
as
his
own
person
is
concerned
of
cheating
the
devil
of
his
due
as
the
church
has
uniformly
consigned
great
inventors
to
the
infernal
regions
his
satanic
majesty
could
have
never
had
any
lack
of
ingenious
wits
among
his
subjects
capable
of
advising
him
in
such
matters
an
important
consideration
which
did
not
disturb
the
minds
of
mediæval
jurists
nor
stay
the
hand
of
strictly
retributive
justice
is
the
fact
now
generally
admitted
that
crimes
like
all
other
human
actions
are
subject
to
certain
fixed
laws
which
seem
to
some
extent
to
remove
them
from
the
province
of
free
will
and
the
power
of
individual
determination
professor
morselli
has
shown
statistically
that
suicide
which
we
are
wont
to
consider
a
wholly
voluntary
act
is
really
dependent
upon
a
great
variety
of
circumstances
over
which
man
has
no
control
climate
seasons
months
days
state
of
crops
domestic
social
political
financial
economical
geographical
and
meteorological
conditions
sun
moon
and
stars
all
work
together
impelling
him
to
or
keeping
him
from
it
suicide
increases
when
the
earth
is
in
aphelion
and
decreases
when
it
is
in
perihelion
race
and
religion
are
also
important
factors
in
aggravating
or
mitigating
the
suicidal
tendency
germans
and
protestants
being
most
and
semitic
nations
and
mohammedans
including
those
of
aryan
and
african
blood
being
least
addicted
to
it
suicide
is
in
fact
the
resultant
of
a
vast
number
of
complicated
and
forces
which
we
can
neither
trace
nor
measure
and
of
which
the
victims
themselves
are
for
the
most
part
unconscious
to
a
very
considerable
degree
it
is
a
question
of
environment
in
the
broadest
sense
of
the
term
an
effect
says
morselli
of
the
struggle
for
existence
and
of
human
selection
working
according
to
the
laws
of
evolution
among
civilized
what
is
proved
to
be
true
of
is
equally
so
of
murder
and
every
other
crime
an
additional
reflection
that
must
give
us
pause
in
the
presence
of
crime
is
that
some
of
the
chief
causes
operating
to
produce
the
manifold
evils
afflicting
society
and
threatening
to
subvert
it
are
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
present
egoistic
organization
of
our
social
and
industrial
system
the
selfish
and
unscrupulous
power
of
wealth
directed
and
stimulated
by
superior
intelligence
and
energy
on
the
one
hand
and
the
brute
forces
of
ignorance
driven
to
despair
by
the
disheartening
and
debasing
pressure
of
poverty
on
the
other
hand
arrayed
against
each
other
in
fierce
and
bitter
conflict
much
of
the
individual
viciousness
which
society
is
required
to
punish
springs
directly
from
the
unjust
and
injurious
conditions
of
life
which
society
itself
has
created
it
is
the
perception
of
this
fact
that
disturbs
the
conscience
puzzles
the
will
and
palsies
the
arm
of
the
modern
and
executor
of
justice
mediæval
legislators
were
not
restrained
by
any
scruples
of
this
sort
they
regarded
the
criminal
both
human
and
animal
as
the
sole
author
of
the
crime
ascribing
it
simply
to
his
own
wickedness
and
never
looking
beyond
the
mere
actual
deed
to
the
social
influences
psychical
and
physical
characteristics
and
inherited
qualities
that
impelled
him
with
irresistible
force
to
do
iniquitous
things
this
was
doubtless
a
very
narrow
superficial
and
utterly
unphilosophical
view
of
human
action
and
responsibility
the
danger
lies
in
the
opposite
extreme
in
the
tendency
to
pity
the
vicious
individual
as
the
passive
product
and
commiserable
victim
of
unfortunate
conditions
and
while
engaged
in
the
laudable
attempt
to
improve
these
conditions
by
working
out
broad
and
benevolent
plans
of
permanent
relief
and
reformation
for
the
future
amelioration
of
society
to
relax
penalties
and
to
fail
in
providing
by
sufficiently
stringent
measures
for
its
present
security
tribunals
have
only
to
do
with
individual
criminals
as
their
conduct
affects
the
general
welfare
in
what
manner
their
characters
have
been
formed
by
ancestral
agencies
and
other
predispositions
may
be
an
interesting
study
to
the
psychologist
and
the
sociologist
but
does
not
concern
the
judge
or
the
jurist
in
the
discharge
of
their
official
functions
the
problem
of
crime
is
therefore
a
very
simple
one
so
far
as
the
criminal
lawyer
has
to
deal
with
the
concrete
case
but
very
complex
when
we
look
beyond
the
overt
act
to
its
genesis
in
the
life
of
the
race
the
proper
administration
of
penal
justice
is
weakened
and
defeated
by
mixing
itself
up
with
inquiries
wholly
foreign
to
it
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
the
theory
of
evolution
in
its
application
to
man
s
free
agency
should
arrive
at
essentially
the
same
conclusion
as
the
theology
of
augustine
and
calvin
predestination
which
the
suffragan
of
hippo
and
the
genevan
divine
attributed
to
the
arbitrary
decrees
of
god
evolution
traces
to
the
influences
of
heredity
upon
individuals
predetermining
their
bodily
and
mental
constitutions
there
is
however
a
wide
difference
between
these
two
doctrines
in
their
workings
from
the
clutch
of
a
deity
willing
to
show
his
wrath
and
to
make
his
power
known
no
man
can
by
any
effort
of
his
own
effect
his
escape
against
this
imperious
and
general
sentence
of
damnation
no
process
of
development
no
upward
striving
no
individual
initiative
can
be
of
any
avail
evolution
on
the
contrary
promises
a
gradual
release
from
low
ancestral
conditions
the
original
sin
of
the
theologians
and
opens
up
to
the
race
a
way
of
redemption
not
only
through
natural
selection
and
spontaneous
variations
resulting
in
higher
and
nobler
types
of
mankind
but
also
through
the
modification
of
inherited
traits
by
careful
breeding
thorough
discipline
and
the
conscious
and
constant
endeavour
of
every
human
being
to
improve
and
perfect
himself
salvation
through
the
election
of
grace
is
by
no
means
identical
with
salvation
through
the
survival
of
the
the
righteousness
of
those
whom
god
has
chosen
as
the
vessels
of
mercy
whom
he
had
afore
prepared
unto
glory
may
be
and
probably
is
as
filthy
rags
evolutionary
science
on
the
contrary
recognizes
and
appreciates
redeemable
qualities
by
selecting
strengthening
and
propagating
them
and
by
this
means
aims
ultimately
to
redeem
the
world
it
imposes
upon
each
man
the
duty
and
necessity
of
working
out
his
own
salvation
not
with
fear
and
trembling
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
an
angry
deity
but
with
hope
and
cheerfulness
knowing
that
the
beneficent
forces
of
nature
are
working
in
him
as
in
all
forms
of
organic
life
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
development
towards
the
goal
of
his
highest
possible
perfection
by
gradually
eliminating
the
heirloom
of
the
beast
and
the
savage
and
letting
the
instincts
of
the
tiger
and
the
ape
slowly
die
within
him
the
best
man
said
socrates
is
he
who
seeks
most
earnestly
to
perfect
himself
and
the
happiest
man
is
he
who
has
the
fullest
consciousness
that
he
is
perfecting
this
utterance
of
the
athenian
sage
expresses
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
ethics
of
evolution
according
to
which
there
can
be
no
greater
sin
than
the
neglect
of
holding
as
it
does
in
the
province
of
science
a
place
corresponding
in
importance
to
that
which
the
unpardonable
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
holds
in
the
province
of
theology
no
one
is
blamable
for
inheriting
bad
tendencies
but
every
one
is
blamable
for
not
striving
to
eradicate
them
if
evil
impulses
prove
to
be
irresistible
then
society
must
step
in
and
render
them
harmless
by
depriving
of
life
or
liberty
the
unfortunate
victims
of
such
propensities
again
if
the
mental
and
moral
qualities
of
the
lower
animals
differ
from
those
of
man
not
in
kind
but
only
in
degree
and
the
human
mammal
is
descended
from
a
stock
of
primates
to
which
apes
and
bats
belong
and
dogs
and
cats
and
pigs
are
more
remotely
akin
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
point
at
which
moral
and
penal
responsibility
ceases
in
the
descending
or
begins
in
the
ascending
scale
of
being
that
beasts
and
birds
and
even
insects
commit
acts
of
violence
which
in
human
agents
would
be
called
crimes
and
which
spring
from
the
same
psychical
causes
and
as
we
have
shown
in
another
work

by

the

or
the
swarm
in
a
more
or
less
judicial
manner
is
undeniable
the
zoöpsychologist
lacassagne
divides
the
criminal
offences
of
animals
into
six
classes
or
categories
the
ground
of
the
classification
being
the
motives
which
underlie
and
originate
them
the
lowest
or
most
rudimentary
motive
to
crime
in
both
man
and
beast
is
hunger
the
operation
of
which
is
seen
in
the
spectacle
of
one
savage
killing
another
in
order
to
get
sole
possession
of
a
wild
beast
slain
by
them
in
common
and
in
the
ferocity
of
two
dogs
fighting
over
a
bone
perhaps
the
great
majority
of
crimes
afflicting
society
at
the
present
time
have
their
origin
in
this
source
next
to
the
desire
of
the
individual
to
preserve
himself
comes
the
desire
to
preserve
his
kind
this
motive
is
commonly
considered
a
more
generous
impulse
and
is
praised
as
parental
affection
this
earliest
and
most
primitive
of
altruistic
emotions
is
exceedingly
strong
in
the
lower
animals
especially
in
those
whose
offspring
are
comparatively
helpless
in
infancy
as
is
the
case
with
all
species
of
monkeys
and
manifests
itself
not
only
in
tender
care
of
the
young
but
also
in
theft
robbery
and
other
acts
of
violence
committed
for
their
sake
the
wanton
love
of
destruction
characterizes
both
beasts
and
men
there
are
roughs
and
vandals
among
the
former
as
well
as
among
the
latter
who
take
a
malicious
delight
in
doing
injury
to
persons
and
property
vanity
and
the
desire
of
showing
off
play
no
small
part
in
the
wrongdoings
of
apes
and
apish
men
and
women
other
incentives
to
crime
are
ambition
sexual
passion
gregariousness
the
concentrated
egoism
and
merciless
brutality
of
a
crowd
even
in
the
most
civilized
communities
the
outrages
so
recklessly
perpetrated
by
what
a
french
jurist
tarde
calls
that
impulsive
and
maniac
beast
the
it
may
be
remarked
too
that
the
kinds
of
criminal
actions
which
civilization
tends
to
diminish
among
men
domestication
tends
to
diminish
among
the
lower
animals
if
these
statements
be
correct
why
should
not
animals
be
held
penally
responsible
for
their
conduct
as
well
as
human
beings
there
are
men
apparently
less
intelligent
than
apes
why
then
should
the
man
be
capitally
punished
and
the
ape
not
brought
to
trial
and
if
the
ape
be
made
responsible
and
punishable
why
not
the
dog
the
horse
the
pig
and
the
cat
in
other
words
does
evolutionary
criminology
justify
the
judicial
proceedings
instituted
by
mediæval
courts
against
animals
or
regard
the
typical
human
criminal
as
having
in
this
respect
no
supremacy
over
the
beast
does
modern
science
take
us
back
to
the
barbarities
of
the
middle
ages
in
matters
of
penal
legislation
and
in
abolishing
judicial
procedure
against
quadrupedal
beasts
is
it
thereby
logically
forced
to
stay
the
hand
of
justice
uplifted
against
bipedal
brutes
the
answer
to
these
questions
is
unhesitatingly
negative
zoöpsychology
is
the
key
to
anthropopsychology
and
enables
us
to
get
a
clearer
conception
of
the
genesis
of
human
crime
by
studying
its
manifestations
in
the
lower
creation
we
thus
see
it
in
the
process
of
becoming
acquire
a
more
correct
appreciation
of
its
nature
and
origin
and
learn
how
to
deal
with
it
more
rationally
and
effectively
in
bestial
man
another
point
discussed
by
plato
and
still
seriously
debated
by
writers
on
criminal
jurisprudence
is
whether
punishment
is
to
be
inflicted
peccatum
or
in
other
words
whether
the
object
of
it
should
be
retributive
or
preventive
the
truth
is
however
that
both
of
these
motives
are
operative
and
as
determining
causes
are
so
closely
intermixed
that
it
is
impossible
to
separate
them
as
the
distinguished
criminalist
professor
von
liszt
has
remarked
one
might
as
well
ask
whether
a
sick
man
takes
medicine
because
he
is
ill
or
in
order
to
get
well
the
penalty
is
imposed
in
consequence
of
the
commission
of
a
crime
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
recurrence
of
it
and
is
therefore
both
retributory
and
reformatory
punishment
is
defined
by
laas
as
ethicized
and
nationalized
revenge
exercised
by
the
state
or
body
politic
which
is
alone
impartial
enough
to
pronounce
just
judgments
and
powerful
enough
to
execute
civilization
takes
vengeance
out
of
the
hands
of
the
injured
individual
and
delegates
it
to
the
community
or
commonwealth
which
has
been
outraged
in
his
person
the
underlying
principle
however
is
in
both
cases
the
same
and
the
idea
of
justice
as
administered
by
the
community
does
not
rise
above
that
entertained
by
the
aggregate
or
average
of
individuals
composing
it
the
recent
growth
of
sociology
and
especially
the
scientific
study
of
the
laws
of
heredity
thus
tend
by
exciting
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
psychological
solution
of
such
questions
to
render
men
less
positive
and
peremptory
in
their
judicial
decisions
the
intellectual
horizon
is
so
greatly
enlarged
and
so
many
possibilities
are
suggested
that
it
is
difficult
for
conscientious
persons
strongly
affected
by
these
speculations
and
honestly
endeavouring
to
make
an
ethical
or
penal
application
of
them
to
come
to
a
prompt
and
practical
conclusion
in
any
given
case
the
voice
of
decision
loses
its
magisterial
sternness
and
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
o
er
with
the
pale
cast
of
if
it
be
true
as
galton
affirms
that
legal
ability
is
transmitted
from
father
to
son
criminal
proclivity
may
be
equally
hereditary
and
the
judge
and
the
culprit
may
have
reached
their
relative
positions
through
a
line
of
ancestral
influences
working
according
to
immutable
and
inevasible
laws
of
descent
schopenhauer
maintained
the
theory
of
responsibility
for
character
and
not
for
actions
which
are
simply
the
outgrowth
and
expression
of
character
the
same
act
may
be
good
or
bad
according
to
the
motives
from
which
it
springs
this
distinction
is
constantly
made
both
in
ethics
and
in
jurisprudence
and
determines
our
moral
judgments
and
judicial
decisions
yet
the
chief
elements
which
enter
into
a
person
s
character
and
contribute
to
its
formation
lie
beyond
his
control
or
even
his
consciousness
and
in
many
cases
have
done
their
work
before
his
birth
responsibility
for
character
is
equivalent
to
responsibility
for
all
the
inherited
tendencies
and
prenatal
influences
of
which
character
is
the
resultant
and
leads
at
last
to
the
theological
dogma
of
the
imputation
of
sin
all
the
way
back
to
adam
as
the
federal
head
of
the
race
a
doctrine
which
schopenhauer
would
be
the
first
to
repudiate
besides
evil
propensities
and
criminal
designs
are
recognizable
and
punishable
only
when
embodied
in
overt
acts
the
law
can
not
deprive
a
man
of
life
or
liberty
because
he
is
known
to
be
vicious
and
depraved
although
the
police
in
the
exercise
of
its
protective
and
preventive
functions
and
as
a
means
of
providing
for
the
general
security
may
feel
in
duty
bound
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
him
and
to
make
an
occasional
raid
on
the
dens
and
dives
haunted
by
him
and
his
kind
there
are
also
instances
on
record
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
trace
the
culpable
act
to
any
marked
corruption
of
character
a
rather
remarkable
illustration
of
this
fact
is
furnished
by
the
trial
of
marie
jeanneret
which
took
place
at
geneva
in
switzerland
in
and
which
deservedly
ranks
high
among
the
of
the
present
century
both
as
a
legal
question
and
a
problem
of
at
the
time
when
this
trial
occurred
the
writer
directed
attention
to
the
peculiar
and
perplexing
features
of
the
case
in
for
january
p
dumas
in
his
novel
comte
de
monte
describes
the
character
and
career
of
a
young
refined
and
beautiful
woman
moving
in
the
best
circles
of
parisian
society
and
yet
poisoning
successively
six
or
seven
members
of
her
own
family
but
even
the
most
imaginative
and
audacious
of
french
romancers
did
not
dare
to
delineate
such
criminality
without
ascribing
it
to
some
apparently
adequate
motive
madame
de
villefort
administered
deadly
potions
to
her
relatives
under
the
impulse
of
a
morbidly
intense
maternal
love
which
centred
all
her
moral
and
intellectual
faculties
on
the
idea
of
making
her
son
the
sole
heir
to
a
large
estate
affection
and
social
ambition
for
her
offspring
incited
her
to
the
murder
of
her
kin
but
the
invention
which
created
such
a
monster
of
sentimental
depravity
has
been
far
surpassed
in
real
life
by
the
exploits
of
marie
jeanneret
a
swiss
nurse
who
took
advantage
of
her
professional
position
to
give
doses
of
poison
to
the
sick
persons
confided
to
her
care
from
the
effects
of
which
seven
of
them
died
in
the
commission
of
this
monotonous
series
of
diabolical
crimes
the
culprit
does
not
seem
to
have
been
animated
either
by
animosity
or
cupidity
on
the
contrary
she
always
showed
the
warmest
affection
for
her
victims
and
nursed
them
with
the
tenderest
care
and
the
most
untiring
devotion
as
she
watched
the
distressful
workings
of
the
fatal
draught
nor
did
she
derive
the
slightest
material
benefit
from
her
course
of
conduct
but
rather
suffered
considerable
pecuniary
loss
by
the
death
of
her
patients
the
testimony
of
physicians
and
alienists
furnished
no
evidence
of
insanity
nor
did
she
show
any
signs
of
atavistic
reversion
physiological
abnormity
or
hereditary
homicidal
bent
monomaniacs
usually
act
fitfully
and
impulsively
but
marie
jeanneret
always
manifested
the
coolest
premeditation
and
never
exhibiting
the
least
hesitation
or
confusion
or
the
faintest
trace
of
hallucination
but
answered
with
the
greatest
clearness
and
calmness
every
question
put
by
the
president
of
the
court
even
turrettini
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
presenting
the
case
to
the
jury
was
unable
to
discover
any
rational
principle
on
which
to
explain
the
conduct
and
urge
the
conviction
of
the
accused
and
after
exhausting
the
common
category
of
hypotheses
and
showing
the
inadequacy
of
each
he
was
driven
by
sheer
stress
of
inexplicability
to
seek
a
motive
in
espèce
de
volupté
qu
elle
éprouverait
à
commettre
un
or
what
in
less
elegant
but
more
vigorous
western
vernacular
would
be
called
pure
not
only
was
such
an
explanation
merely
a
circumlocutory
confession
of
ignorance
but
it
was
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
general
character
of
the
indictee
indeed
the
persistent
and
pitiless
perpetration
of
this
one
sort
of
crime
by
this
woman
under
circumstances
which
should
have
excited
compassion
in
the
hardest
human
heart
seems
more
like
the
working
of
some
baneful
and
irrepressible
force
in
nature
or
the
relentless
operation
of
a
destructive
machine
than
like
the
voluntary
action
of
a
free
and
responsible
moral
agent
zurlinden
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
dwelt
with
emphasis
upon
this
mysterious
phase
of
the
case
and
thus
saved
his
client
from
the
scaffold
the
jury
after
five
hours
deliberation
rendered
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
extenuating
circumstances
as
the
result
of
which
the
accused
was
sentenced
to
twenty
years
hard
labour
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
no
circumstances
of
an
extenuating
character
except
the
utter
inability
of
the
jurors
to
discover
any
motive
for
the
commission
of
such
a
succession
of
atrocities
after
fifteen
years
imprisonment
the
convict
died
during
this
whole
period
of
incarceration
she
not
only
showed
great
intelligence
and
strict
integrity
but
was
also
remarkably
kind
and
helpful
to
all
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
she
instructed
her
in
and
fine
embroidery
loved
to
attend
them
in
sickness
and
by
her
general
influence
raised
very
perceptibly
the
tone
of
morals
in
the
workhouse
if
it
be
true
as
asserted
by
mynheer
heymanns
one
of
the
latest
expounders
of
schopenhauer
s
ethics
that
a
man
is
responsible
for
his
actions
only
so
far
as
his
character
finds
expression
in
them
and
is
to
be
judged
solely
by
his
character
what
shall
be
done
in
cases
like
the
in
which
the
criminal
conduct
is
exceptional
and
so
far
from
being
symptomatic
of
the
general
character
stands
out
as
an
isolated
and
ugly
excrescence
and
appalling
abnormity
according
to
this
theory
crime
is
to
be
punished
only
when
it
is
the
natural
outgrowth
and
legitimate
fruit
of
the
criminal
s
individuality
and
society
is
to
be
left
unprotected
against
all
maleficence
not
traceable
to
such
an
origin
there
can
be
hardly
any
doubt
that
the
swiss
nurse
was
a
toxicomaniac
and
that
she
had
become
infatuated
with
poisons
partly
by
watching
their
effects
on
her
own
system
and
partly
by
reading
about
their
properties
in
medical
and
botanical
works
to
the
study
of
which
she
was
passionately
devoted
did
not
mithridates
if
we
may
believe
the
statements
of
galen
experiment
with
poisons
on
living
persons
why
should
she
not
follow
such
an
illustrious
example
especially
as
she
never
hesitated
to
take
herself
the
potions
she
administered
to
others
the
only
difference
being
that
habit
had
made
her
like
the
famous
king
of
pontus
proof
against
their
venom
she
often
attempted
analyses
of
these
substances
and
in
one
instance
was
severely
burned
by
the
bursting
of
a
crucible
in
which
she
was
endeavouring
to
obtain
atropine
from
atropa
belladonna
or
deadly
nightshade
it
was
this
terrible
poison
which
is
endowed
with
exceedingly
energetic
qualities
and
is
therefore
used
by
physicians
with
extreme
precaution
that
seems
to
have
had
an
irresistible
fascination
for
her
growing
into
an
insane
desire
to
discover
and
test
its
occult
virtues
she
had
read
and
heard
of
zealous
scientists
and
illustrious
physicians
who
had
experimented
on
themselves
and
on
their
disciples
and
become
the
benefactors
of
mankind
why
then
should
she
not
adopt
the
same
method
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
and
use
for
this
purpose
the
physiological
material
which
her
profession
placed
in
her
hands
however
preposterous
such
reasoning
on
her
part
may
appear
to
us
and
however
vaguely
and
subconsciously
the
mental
process
may
have
been
carried
on
it
offers
the
only
theory
adequate
to
explain
all
the
facts
and
to
account
for
the
almost
incredible
union
of
contradictory
traits
in
her
character
the
enthusiasm
of
the
experimenter
overbore
in
her
the
native
sympathy
of
the
woman
she
observed
the
writhings
of
her
poisoned
victims
with
as
much
delight
as
professor
mantegazza
confesses
he
felt
in
studying
the
physiology
of
pain
in
the
dumb
animals
shrieking
and
groaning
on
his
tormentatore
the
physiologist
says
claude
bernard
is
no
ordinary
man
he
is
a
savant
seized
and
possessed
by
a
scientific
idea
he
does
not
hear
the
cries
of
suffering
wrung
from
racked
and
lacerated
creatures
nor
see
the
blood
which
flows
he
has
nothing
before
his
eyes
but
his
idea
and
the
organisms
which
are
hiding
the
secrets
he
means
to
marie
jeanneret
was
a
fanatic
of
this
kind
she
too
was
a
woman
possessed
with
ideas
as
witches
were
once
supposed
to
be
possessed
with
devils
had
she
prudently
confined
her
experiments
to
the
torture
of
helpless
animals
she
might
perhaps
have
taken
rank
in
the
scientific
world
with
brachet

and
other
celebrated
vivisectors
and
been
admitted
with
honour
to
the
academy
instead
of
being
thrust
ignominiously
into
a
penitentiary
the
assertion
as
regards
any
supposed
case
of
madness
that
there
s
method
in
it
is
popularly
assumed
to
be
equivalent
to
a
denial
of
the
existence
of
the
madness
altogether
but
affords
no
warrant
for
such
an
assumption
an
individual
who
commits
murder
under
the
impulse
of
morbid
jealousy
pecuniary
distress
social
rancour
political
or
scientific
fanaticism
or
any
other
form
of
monomania
is
not
the
less
the
victim
of
a
mind
diseased
because
he
shows
rational
forethought
in
planning
and
executing
the
deed
his
mental
faculties
may
be
perfectly
healthy
and
normal
in
their
operation
up
to
the
point
of
derangement
from
which
the
fatal
act
proceeds
no
chain
is
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
and
this
is
equally
true
of
physical
and
psychical
concatenations
under
such
circumstances
the
sane
powers
of
the
mind
are
all
at
the
mercy
of
the
one
fault
and
are
made
to
minister
to
this
single
infirmity
according
to
english
law
a
man
is
irresponsibly
insane
when
he
has
such
defect
of
reason
from
disease
of
the
mind
as
not
to
know
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
act
he
was
doing
or
if
he
did
know
it
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
doing
what
was
this
definition
is
very
incomplete
and
covers
only
the
most
obvious
forms
of
insanity
perhaps
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
there
is
no
defect
of
reason
nor
disease
of
mind
in
the
proper
sense
of
these
terms
but
only
a
disturbance
of
the
emotions
or
perversion
of
the
will
originating
in
physical
disorder
besides
it
is
undeniable
that
animal
intelligence
is
capable
of
distinguishing
between
right
and
wrong
and
of
comprehending
what
is
punishable
and
what
is
not
punishable
in
general
when
a
dog
does
wrong
he
knows
that
he
is
doing
wrong
and
a
monkey
often
takes
delight
in
doing
what
is
wrong
simply
because
he
knows
it
is
wrong
if
a
monkey
gets
angry
and
kills
a
child
he
obeys
the
same
vicious
propensity
that
impels
a
brutal
man
to
commit
murder
there
is
no
greater
defect
of
reason
in
one
case
than
in
the
other
why
then
should
the
monkey
be
summarily
shot
or
knocked
on
the
head
and
the
man
arrested
tried
convicted
and
hanged
by
the
constituted
authorities
simply
because
such
a
public
prosecution
and
execution
would
not
exert
any
influence
whatever
in
preventing
infanticide
on
the
part
of
other
monkeys
if
it
could
be
shown
that
a
formal
trial
of
the
monkey
would
produce
this
salutary
effect
then
it
certainly
ought
not
to
be
omitted
the
recent
attempt
to
modify
the
english
law
so
as
to
render
all
certifiably
insane
persons
irresponsible
for
their
actions
would
result
in
the
abolition
of
all
punishment
for
crime
since
many
physicians
regard
every
criminal
as
insane
and
would
not
hesitate
to
certify
their
opinion
to
the
proper
tribunal
it
is
no
easy
task
for
penal
legislation
to
keep
pace
with
psychiatral
investigation
and
to
adjust
itself
to
the
wide
range
and
nice
distinctions
of
modern
nor
is
it
necessary
to
do
so
socialis
suprema
lex
society
is
bound
to
protect
itself
against
every
criminal
assault
no
matter
what
its
source
or
character
may
be
this
is
the
ultimate
object
not
only
of
the
prison
and
the
scaffold
but
also
of
all
reformatories
for
juvenile
offenders
and
vagabonds
who
by
judicious
correction
and
instruction
may
perhaps
be
brought
to
amend
their
ways
and
thus
be
prevented
from
becoming
a
social
danger
by
swelling
the
disorderly
ranks
of
the
permanently
criminal
classes
if
a
person
proves
to
be
unamenable
to
moral
or
penitential
measures
and
remains
an
incorrigible
transgressor
it
is
the
duty
of
the
community
to
set
him
aside
by
death
or
by
durance
penal
legislation
does
not
aim
primarily
at
the
betterment
of
the
individual
laws
are
enacted
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
men
good
and
noble
but
solely
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
them
safe
members
of
society
this
is
effected
by
depriving
the
irremediably
vicious
of
their
liberty
and
if
necessary
also
of
their
life
the
pardoning
power
too
must
be
exercised
with
the
utmost
reserve
and
circumspection
the
state
does
not
look
upon
public
offences
as
sins
but
as
crimes
the
introduction
of
the
theological
conception
of
delinquencies
into
the
province
of
civil
government
has
always
been
the
vice
of
hierarchies
and
has
never
failed
to
work
immense
mischief
by
leading
inevitably
to
impertinent
intermeddling
with
matters
of
conscience
and
private
opinion
putting
a
premium
on
pretended
repentance
and
like
hypocrisies
and
converting
the
into
a
confessional
and
the
court
of
justice
into
a
court
of
inquisition
this
has
been
uniformly
the
result
wherever
a
body
of
priests
has
become
a
body
of
rulers
endowed
with
sovereignty
in
the
administration
of
secular
affairs
if
it
could
be
conclusively
proved
or
even
rendered
highly
probable
that
the
capital
punishment
of
an
ox
which
had
gored
a
man
to
death
deterred
other
oxen
from
pushing
with
their
horns
it
would
be
the
unquestionable
right
and
imperative
duty
of
our
legislatures
and
tribunals
to
and
execute
the
old
mosaic
law
on
this
subject
in
like
manner
if
it
can
be
satisfactorily
shown
that
the
hanging
of
an
admittedly
insane
person
who
has
committed
murder
prevents
other
insane
persons
from
perpetrating
the
same
crime
or
tends
to
diminish
the
number
of
those
who
go
insane
in
the
same
direction
it
is
clearly
the
duty
of
society
to
hang
such
persons
whatever
may
be
the
opinion
of
the
alienist
concerning
their
moral
responsibility
nor
is
this
merely
a
hypothetical
case
or
purely
academical
question
it
is
a
fact
that
the
partially
insane
especially
those
affected
with
moral
insanity
or
cranks
have
their
intelligence
intact
and
are
capable
of
exercising
their
reasoning
powers
freely
and
fully
in
laying
their
plans
and
in
carrying
out
their
designs
indeed
criminals
of
this
class
are
sometimes
known
to
have
entertained
the
thought
that
they
would
be
acquitted
on
the
ground
of
insanity
and
have
thereby
been
emboldened
to
do
the
deed
and
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
but
highly
probable
that
a
belief
in
the
certainty
of
punishment
would
have
acted
as
an
effective
deterrent
a
case
of
this
kind
occurred
in
in
england
where
an
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum
deliberately
murdered
a
lawyer
who
was
visiting
the
institution
the
murderer
declared
that
he
had
no
grudge
against
his
victim
but
believed
himself
to
be
persecuted
in
general
and
wished
to
call
attention
to
his
wrongs
by
assassinating
some
official
or
prominent
person
his
method
of
redress
was
that
of
the
ordinary
anarchist
and
his
confession
that
he
would
not
have
dared
to
commit
the
act
unless
he
had
believed
that
as
a
certificated
lunatic
under
confinement
he
ran
no
risk
of
being
hanged
illustrates
the
point
in
question
there
can
be
no
doubt
for
example
that
the
execution
of
guiteau
for
the
assassination
of
garfield
has
greatly
lessened
the
dangers
of
this
kind
to
which
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
exposed
just
as
the
swift
and
severe
punishment
of
the
chicago
anarchists
has
dampened
the
zeal
and
restrained
the
activity
of
the
fanatics
who
labour
under
the
delusion
that
in
a
free
country
dynamite
bombs
are
the
fittest
means
of
disseminating
reformatory
ideas
and
bringing
about
the
social
and
political
regeneration
of
the
world
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
remark
upon
the
absurdity
of
lombroso
s
assertion
that
the
jurists
who
formerly
condemned
and
punished
animals
were
more
logical
and
consistent
than
those
who
now
pass
sentence
of
death
on
cretins
like
grandi
or
cranks
like
passannante
and
guiteau
di
torino
vol
ii
fasc
iv
since
he
utterly
ignores
the
preventive
character
and
purpose
of
judicial
punishment
and
its
practical
utility
in
checking
the
homicidal
propensities
of
such
persons
whereas
the
criminal
prosecution
and
capital
punishment
of
a
pig
for
infanticide
will
not
have
the
slightest
effect
in
preventing
other
pigs
from
mangling
and
devouring
little
children
that
animals
might
be
deterred
from
doing
violence
to
men
by
putting
one
of
their
kind
to
death
and
suspending
its
body
as
a
scarecrow
is
maintained
by
a
distinguished
writer
in
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
hierolymus
rosarius
the
nuntius
of
pope
clement
vii
to
the
court
of
ferdinand
then
king
of
hungary
who
states
that
in
africa
crucified
lions
are
placed
near
towns
and
that
other
lions
however
hungry
they
may
be
are
kept
away
through
fear
of
the
same
punishment
pœnæ

he
records
also
that
in
riding
from
cologne
towards
düren
he
and
his
companions
saw
in
the
vast
forest
two
wolves
in
brogans
hanging
on
a
gallows
just
like
two
thieves
as
a
warning
to
the
rest
of
the
pack

manner
the
american

sets
up
a

as
a

for

of
his

we
may
add
that
rosarius
entertained
a
high
opinion
of
the
intelligence
and
moral
character
of
animals
and
wrote
a
book
to
prove
their
frequent
superiority
to
men
in
the
use
of
their
rational
faculties
this
very
clever
and
original
work
entitled
animalia
bruta
sæpe
ratione
utantur
melius
was
first
published
by
gabriel
naudé
at
paris
in
an
enlarged
edition
was
issued
by
ribow
at
helmstedt
in
with
a
dissertation
on
the
soul
in
animals
in
the
class
of
minds
yclept
cranks
just
mentioned
the
spirit
of
imitation
is
peculiarly
strong
and
morbidly
contagious
the
celebrated
psychiater
baron
von
feuchtersleben
in
his
treatise
the
diatetics
of
the
cites
the
case
of
a
french
soldier
who
shot
himself
in
a
soon
afterwards
several
other
soldiers
took
their
lives
in
the
same
manner
and
in
the
same
place
napoleon
ordered
the
to
be
burned
and
thus
put
an
end
to
the
suicides
a
similar
instance
is
recorded
by
max
simon
in
his
de
l
in
which
he
states
that
a
workman
hanged
himself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
gate
and
his
example
was
followed
directly
by
a
dozen
of
his
fellows
so
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
wall
up
the
gate
in
order
to
stop
this
strange
epidemic
the
same
effect
is
produced
by
popular
romances
in
which
the
hero
or
heroine
or
both
together
dispose
of
themselves
in
this
way
sometimes
whole
communities
are
thus
infected
by
a
single
work
of
fiction
perhaps
the
most
notable
case
of
this
kind
in
modern
literature
is
the
era
of
sentimentalism
and
suicidism
which
followed
the
publication
of
goethe
s
it
is
well
known
too
that
another
class
of
sensational
novels
the
plots
of
which
consist
in
the
development
of
criminal
intrigues
tend
to
promote
crime
by
rendering
it
fascinating
and
indicating
an
attractive
and
exciting
method
of
perpetrating
it
we
have
a
recent
and
very
striking
instance
of
this
kind
in
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
notorious
dreyfus
affair
in
june
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
arrest
of
dreyfus
a
novel
entitled
deux
by
louis
letang
appeared
in
the
paris
the
plot
of
which
may
be
concisely
described
as
follows
a
young
and
capable
officer
captain
philippe
dormelles
who
holds
a
position
of
confidence
in
the
french
department
of
war
is
envied
and
hated
by
two
colleagues
named
aurélien
and
daniel
their
enmity
and
jealousy
finally
become
so
intense
that
they
conspire
to
effect
his
ruin
by
accusing
him
of
selling
to
a
foreign
power
the
secrets
of
the
national
defence
it
is
arranged
that
a
compromising
letter
imitating
the
handwriting
of
dormelles
and
addressed
to
a
foreign
military
shall
be
placed
in
the
secret
archives
where
it
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
head
of
the
department
alleward
dormelles
is
arrested
and
thrown
into
the
prison
and
at
the
same
time
daniel
causes
a
violent
article
to
be
inserted
in
a
newspaper
charging
him
with
high
treason
and
seeking
to
excite
public
opinion
against
him
this
article
concludes
with
the
false
statement
that
a
search
in
dormelles
department
had
led
to
the
discovery
of
important
documents
referring
to
the
fabrication
of
smokeless
powder
and
that
thereupon
dormelles
had
confessed
his
guilt
he
is
then
sentenced
to
the
galleys
but
his
betrothed
is
convinced
of
his
innocence
and
finally
succeeds
in
detecting
and
exposing
the
forgeries
alleward
is
arrested
and
commits
suicide
in
prison
not
with
a
razor
like
henry
but
with
a
revolver
one
scene
in
the
novel
describes
the
appearance
of
a
veiled
lady
on
the
very
spot
near
the
champs
elysées
where
the
mysterious
veiled
lady
is
said
to
have
appeared
to
esterhazy
three
years
later
and
for
much
the
same
purpose
the
french
minister
of
war
mercier
was
forced
to
proceed
against
dreyfus
by
the
which
published
lies
about
his
confession
as
did
about
dormelles
the
only
rational
explanation
of
this
remarkable
concurrence
of
events
as
they
are
narrated
in
the
fiction
and
afterwards
occurred
in
fact
is
that
the
method
of
conducting
the
conspiracy
against
dreyfus
and
the
possibility
of
accomplishing
it
were
suggested
by
letang
s
story
although
the
conspirators
doubtless
did
not
anticipate
that
the
logic
of
events
would
render
the
results
of
their
falsehoods
and
forgeries
as
fatal
to
them
as
they
were
to
their
prototypes
in
the
novel
every
scoundrel
is
firmly
convinced
that
he
can
pattern
after
his
precursors
in
villainy
avoid
their
mistakes
and
commit
the
same
crime
without
incurring
the
same
penalty
that
paroxysms
of
epilepsy
hysterics
and
various
forms
of
frenzy
are
contagious
and
may
be
easily
communicated
to
nervous
persons
who
witness
them
has
been
clearly
proved
vicious
passions
obey
the
same
law
of
imitation
even
in
a
still
higher
degree
than
tender
emotions
and
nervous
diseases
and
more
than
two
centuries
ago
the
illustrious
jurisconsult
samuel
pufendorf
laid
down
the
general
principle
that
he
who
for
the
first
time
commits
a
crime
liable
to
spread
by
contagion
and
to
become
virulent
should
be
punished
with
extreme
severity
in
order
that
it
may
not
infect
others
and
create
a
moral
pestilence
the
hemp
cure
is
always
a
harsh
cure
especially
where
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
the
offender
s
mental
soundness
but
in
view
of
the
increasing
frequency
with
which
atrocious
and
wilful
crime
shelters
itself
under
the
plea
of
insanity
and
becomes
an
object
of
misdirected
sympathy
to
maudlin
sentimentalists
the
adoption
of
radical
and
rigorous
measures
in
the
infliction
of
punishment
were
perhaps
an
experiment
well
worth
trying
meanwhile
let
the
psychiater
continue
his
researches

we
have
passed
through
the
present
confused
and
perilous
period
of
transition
from
gross
and
brutal
mediæval
conceptions
of
justice
to
refined
and
humanitarian
modern
conceptions
of
justice
we
may
in
due
time
succeed
in
establishing
our

ayant

lisons
qu
en

eut
vne
telle
quantité
de

en

qui
tomberent
d
vne
nuëé
qu
ayant

on
dit

qu

de

en

ont
fait

le

aués

pour

il

plaira
que
je
remontre
leur
droit
et
fasse
voir
que
les
formalités
qu
on
a
faites
contre
elles
sont
nulles
m
étonnant
fort
de
la
façon
qu
on
en
vse
on
donne
des
plaintes
contre
elles
comme
si
elles
auoient
commis
quelque
crime
on
fait
informer
du
dégat
qu
on
pretend
qu
elles
ayent
fait
on
les
fait
assigner
le
juge
pour
respondre
et
comme
on
sçait
qu
elles
sont
muettes
le
juge
voulant
suppleer
à
ce
defaut
leur
donne
vn
aduocat
pour
representer
en
justice
les
raisons
qu
elles
ne
peuuent
deduire
et
parceq
messieurs
il
vous
a
pleu
de
me
donner
la
liberté
de
parler
pour
les
pauures
animaux
je
diray
pour
leur
defence
en
premier
lieu
qve
l
adiovrnement
laxé
contr
elles
est
nul
comme
laxé
contre
des
bestes
qui
ne
peuuent
ny
doiuent
se
presenter
en
jugement
la
raison
est
que
celuy
qu
on
appelle
doit
estre
capable
de
raison
et
doit
agir
librement
pour
pouuoir
connoitre
vn
delict
or
que
les
animaux
estans
priués
de
cette
lumiere
qui
a
esté
donnée
au
seul
homme
il
faut
conclurre
par
necessaire
consequence
que
telle
procedure
est
nulle
cecy
est
tiré
de
la
loi
premieree
si
quadrupes
pauper
feciss
et
voyci
les
mots
enim
potest
animal
iniuriam
fecisse
quod
sensu
la
seconde
raison
est
que
l
on
ne
peut
appeller
personne
en
jugement
sans
cause
car
autrement
celuy
qui
fait
adjourner
quelqu
vn
sans
raison
il
doit
subir
la
peine
portée
sous
le
tiltre
des
instituts
pœn
tem
mais
ces
animaux
ne
sont
obligés
par
aucune
cause
ny
en
aucune
façon
tenentur
enim
ex
estans
incapables
de
contracter
ex
quasi
contractu
neque
ex
stipulatione
neque
ex
moins
delicto
seu
parce
que
comme
il
a
esté
dit
pour
commettre
vn
crime
il
faut
estre
capable
de
raison
qui
ne
se
rencontre
pas
aux
animaux
qui
sont
priués
de
son
vsage
de
plus
dans
la
iustice
on
ne
doit
rien
faire
qui
ne
porte
coup
la
iustice
en
cela
imitant
la
nature
laquelle
comme
dit
le
philosophe
ne
fait
rien
mal
à
propos
enim
et
natura
nihil
operantur
je
laisse
à
penser
qu
on
pretend
de
faire
ayant
adjourné
ces
bestioles
elles
ne
viendront
pas
respondre
car
elles
sont
muettes
elles
ne
constitueront
pas
des
procureurs
pour
defendre
leur
cause
moins
leur
donneront
des
memoires
pour
deduire
en
jugement
leur
raison
car
elles
sont
priuées
de
raisonnement
en
sorte
que
tel
adjournement
ne
pouuant
auoir
aucun
effect
est
nul
si
donc
l
adjournement
qui
est
la
base
de
tous
les
actes
judiciels
est
nul
le
reste
comme
en
dependant
ne
pourra
subsister
enim
principalis
causa
non
consistat
neque
ea
quæ
consequuntur
locum
on
dira
que
si
bien
tels
animaux
ne
peuuent
constituer
vn
procureur
pour
la
defense
de
leur
droict
et
instruction
de
leur
cause
que
le
juge
de
son
office
le
peut
faire
et
partant
que
le
fait
du
juge
est
le
fait
de
la
partie
a
cela
on
respond
qu
il
est
vray
lors
qu
il
le
fait
selon
la
disposition
du
droict
administratione
suæ
mais
non
pas
en
ce
cas
où
la

n
en

aussi
ne
le
peut

cecy

par

de

que

estrange
on

contre

vne

d

d

à

le

ce
qu

qu

de

il

auoir
la

de

on
vovdra
dire
qu
elles
ont
manqué
en
ce
qu
elles
ne

que

on
peut
faire
rendre
contre
elles
sentence
contumaciale
à
cause
de
leur

à
cela
on
respond
qu

de

si
on
prend
garde
à
la
définition
de
l
excommunication
on
verra
qu
on
ne
peut
prononcer

sentence
contre

car
l

que

de
