there
are
crimes
and
crimes
a
comedy
by
august
strindberg
translated
from
the
swedish
with
an
introduction
by
edwin
bjorkman
introduction
strindberg
was
fifty
years
old
when
he
wrote
there
are
crimes
and
crimes
in
the
same
year
he
produced
three
of
his
finest
historical
dramas
the
saga
of
the
folkungs
gustavus
vasa
and
eric
xiv
just
before
he
had
finished
advent
which
he
described
as
a
mystery
and
which
was
published
together
with
there
are
crimes
and
crimes
under
the
common
title
of
in
a
higher
court
back
of
these
dramas
lay
his
strange
confessional
works
inferno
and
legends
and
the
first
two
parts
of
his
autobiographical
toward
damascus
all
of
which
were
finished
between
may
and
some
time
in
the
latter
part
of
and
back
of
these
again
lay
that
period
of
mental
crisis
when
at
paris
in
and
he
strove
to
make
gold
by
the
transmutation
of
baser
metals
while
at
the
same
time
his
spirit
was
travelling
through
all
the
seven
hells
in
its
search
for
the
heaven
promised
by
the
great
mystics
of
the
past
there
are
crimes
and
crimes
may
in
fact
be
regarded
as
his
first
definite
step
beyond
that
crisis
of
which
the
preceding
works
were
at
once
the
record
and
closing
chord
when
in
he
issued
the
author
being
a
long
withheld
fourth
part
of
his
first
autobiographical
series
the
bondwoman
son
he
prefixed
to
it
an
analytical
summary
of
the
entire
body
of
his
work
opposite
the
works
from
appears
in
this
summary
the
following
passage
the
great
crisis
at
the
age
of
fifty
revolutions
in
the
life
of
the
soul
desert
wanderings
swedenborgian
heavens
and
hells
but
concerning
there
are
crimes
and
crimes
and
the
three
historical
dramas
from
the
same
year
he
writes
triumphantly
light
after
darkness
new
productivity
with
recovered
faith
hope
and
love
and
with
full
certitude
in
its
german
version
the
play
is
named
rausch
or
intoxication
which
indicates
the
part
played
by
the
champagne
in
the
plunge
of
maurice
from
the
pinnacles
of
success
to
the
depths
of
misfortune
strindberg
has
more
and
more
come
to
see
that
a
moderation
verging
closely
on
asceticism
is
wise
for
most
men
and
essential
to
the
man
of
genius
who
wants
to
fulfil
his
divine
mission
and
he
does
not
scorn
to
press
home
even
this
comparatively
humble
lesson
with
the
naive
directness
and
fiery
zeal
which
form
such
conspicuous
features
of
all
his
work
but
in
the
title
which
bound
it
to
advent
at
their
joint
publication
we
have
a
better
clue
to
what
the
author
himself
undoubtedly
regards
as
the
most
important
element
of
his
work
its
religious
tendency
the
higher
court
in
which
are
tried
the
crimes
of
maurice
adolphe
and
henriette
is
of
course
the
highest
one
that
man
can
imagine
and
the
crimes
of
which
they
have
all
become
guilty
are
those
which
as
adolphe
remarks
are
not
mentioned
in
the
criminal
code
in
a
word
crimes
against
the
spirit
against
the
impalpable
power
that
moves
us
against
god
the
play
seen
in
this
light
pictures
a
spiritual
change
leading
us
step
by
step
from
the
soul
adrift
on
the
waters
of
life
to
the
state
where
it
is
definitely
oriented
and
impelled
there
are
two
distinct
currents
discernible
in
this
dramatic
revelation
of
progress
from
spiritual
chaos
to
spiritual
order
for
to
order
the
play
must
be
said
to
lead
and
progress
is
implied
in
its
onward
movement
if
there
be
anything
at
all
in
our
growing
modern
conviction
that
any
vital
faith
is
better
than
none
at
all
one
of
the
currents
in
question
refers
to
the
means
rather
than
the
end
to
the
road
rather
than
the
goal
it
brings
us
back
to
those
uncanny
by
which
strindberg
himself
won
his
way
to
the
full
certitude
of
which
the
play
in
its
entirety
is
the
first
tangible
expression
the
elements
entering
into
this
current
are
not
only
mystical
but
occult
they
are
derived
in
part
from
swedenborg
and
in
part
from
that
picturesque
french
dreamer
who
signs
himself
sar
peladan
but
mostly
they
have
sprung
out
of
strindberg
own
experiences
in
moments
of
abnormal
tension
what
happened
or
seemed
to
happen
to
himself
at
paris
in
and
what
he
later
described
with
such
bewildering
exactitude
in
his
inferno
and
legends
all
this
is
here
presented
in
dramatic
form
but
a
little
toned
down
both
to
suit
the
needs
of
the
stage
and
the
calmer
mood
of
the
author
coincidence
is
law
it
is
the
of
providence
the
signal
to
man
that
he
must
beware
mystery
is
the
gospel
the
secret
knitting
of
man
to
man
of
fact
to
fact
deep
beneath
the
surface
of
visible
and
audible
existence
few
writers
could
take
us
into
such
a
realm
of
probable
impossibilities
and
possible
improbabilities
without
losing
all
claim
to
serious
consideration
if
strindberg
has
thus
ventured
to
our
gain
and
no
loss
of
his
own
his
success
can
be
explained
only
by
the
presence
in
the
play
of
that
second
parallel
current
of
thought
and
feeling
this
deeper
current
is
as
simple
as
the
one
nearer
the
surface
is
fantastic
it
is
the
manifestation
of
that
certitude
to
which
i
have
already
referred
and
nothing
will
bring
us
nearer
to
it
than
strindberg
own
confession
of
faith
given
in
his
speeches
to
the
swedish
nation
two
years
ago
in
that
pamphlet
there
is
a
chapter
headed
religion
in
which
occurs
this
passage
since
i
have
been
calling
myself
a
christian
i
am
not
a
catholic
and
have
never
been
but
during
a
stay
of
seven
years
in
catholic
countries
and
among
catholic
relatives
i
discovered
that
the
difference
between
catholic
and
protestant
tenets
is
either
none
at
all
or
else
wholly
superficial
and
that
the
division
which
once
occurred
was
merely
political
or
else
concerned
with
theological
problems
not
fundamentally
germane
to
the
religion
itself
a
registered
protestant
i
am
and
will
remain
but
i
can
hardly
be
called
orthodox
or
evangelistic
but
come
nearest
to
being
a
swedenborgian
i
use
my
bible
christianity
internally
and
privately
to
tame
my
somewhat
decivilized
nature
decivilised
by
that
veterinary
philosophy
and
animal
science
darwinism
in
which
as
student
at
the
university
i
was
reared
and
i
assure
my
that
they
have
no
right
to
complain
because
according
to
my
ability
i
practise
the
christian
teachings
for
only
through
religion
or
the
hope
of
something
better
and
the
recognition
of
the
innermost
meaning
of
life
as
that
of
an
ordeal
a
school
or
perhaps
a
penitentiary
will
it
be
possible
to
bear
the
burden
of
life
with
sufficient
resignation
here
as
elsewhere
it
is
made
patent
that
strindberg
religiosity
always
on
closer
analysis
reduces
itself
to
morality
at
bottom
he
is
first
and
last
and
has
always
been
a
moralist
a
man
passionately
craving
to
know
what
is
right
and
to
do
it
during
the
middle
naturalistic
period
of
his
creative
career
this
fundamental
tendency
was
in
part
obscured
and
he
engaged
in
the
game
of
intellectual
curiosity
known
as
truth
for
truth
own
sake
one
of
the
chief
marks
of
his
final
and
mystical
period
is
his
greater
courage
to
be
himself
in
this
respect
and
this
means
necessarily
a
return
or
an
advance
to
a
position
which
the
late
william
james
undoubtedly
would
have
acknowledged
as
pragmatic
to
combat
the
assertion
of
individualism
that
we
are
ends
in
ourselves
that
we
have
certain
inalienable
personal
rights
to
pleasure
and
happiness
merely
because
we
happen
to
appear
here
in
human
shape
this
is
one
of
most
ardent
aims
in
all
his
later
works
as
to
the
higher
and
more
inclusive
object
to
which
our
lives
must
be
held
subservient
he
is
not
dogmatic
it
may
be
another
life
he
calls
it
god
and
the
code
of
service
he
finds
in
the
tenets
of
all
the
christian
churches
but
principally
in
the
commandments
the
plain
and
primitive
virtues
the
faith
that
implies
little
more
than
square
dealing
between
man
and
man
these
figure
foremost
in
ideals
in
an
age
of
supreme
like
ours
such
an
outlook
would
seem
to
have
small
chance
of
popularity
but
that
it
embodies
just
what
the
time
most
needs
is
perhaps
made
evident
by
the
reception
which
the
public
almost
invariably
grants
there
are
crimes
and
crimes
when
it
is
staged
with
all
its
apparent
disregard
of
what
is
commonly
called
realism
and
with
its
occasional
but
quite
unblushing
use
of
methods
generally
held
superseded
such
as
the
casual
introduction
of
characters
at
whatever
moment
they
happen
to
be
needed
on
the
stage
it
has
from
the
start
been
among
the
most
frequently
played
and
most
enthusiastically
received
of
strindberg
later
dramas
at
stockholm
it
was
first
taken
up
by
the
royal
dramatic
theatre
and
was
later
seen
on
the
tiny
stage
of
the
intimate
theatre
then
devoted
exclusively
to
strindberg
works
it
was
one
of
the
earliest
plays
staged
by
reinhardt
while
he
was
still
experimenting
with
his
little
theatre
at
berlin
and
it
has
also
been
given
in
numerous
german
cities
as
well
as
in
vienna
concerning
my
own
version
of
the
play
i
wish
to
add
a
word
of
explanation
strindberg
has
laid
the
scene
in
paris
not
only
the
scenery
but
the
people
and
the
circumstances
are
french
yet
he
has
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
make
the
dialogue
reflect
french
manners
of
speaking
or
ways
of
thinking
as
he
has
given
it
to
us
the
play
is
french
only
in
its
most
superficial
aspect
in
its
setting
and
this
setting
he
has
chosen
simply
because
he
needed
a
certain
machinery
offered
him
by
the
catholic
but
not
by
the
protestant
churches
the
rest
of
the
play
is
purely
human
in
its
note
and
wholly
universal
in
its
spirit
for
this
reason
i
have
retained
the
french
names
and
titles
but
have
otherwise
striven
to
bring
everything
as
close
as
possible
to
our
own
modes
of
expression
should
apparent
incongruities
result
from
this
manner
of
treatment
i
think
they
will
disappear
if
only
the
reader
will
try
to
remember
that
the
characters
of
the
play
move
in
an
existence
cunningly
woven
by
the
author
out
of
scraps
of
ephemeral
reality
in
order
that
he
may
show
us
the
mirage

jeanne
i
shall
soon

you
are

father
abbe
may
i
ask
why
jeanne
you
have
already
guessed
it
when
he
lets
the
woman
and
the
child
wait
two
hours
in
a
cemetery
then
the
end
is
not
far
off
abbe
and
when
he
has
left
you
what
then
jeanne
then
we
have
to
go
into
the
river
abbe
oh
no
no
jeanne
yes
yes
marion
mamma
i
want
to
go
home
for
i
am
hungry
jeanne
just
a
little
longer
dear
and
we
go
home
abbe
woe
unto
those
who
call
evil
good
and
good
evil
jeanne
what
is
that
woman
doing
at
the
grave
over
there
abbe
she
seems
to
be
talking
to
the
dead
jeanne
but
you
can
not
do
that
abbe
she
seems
to
know
how
jeanne
this
would
mean
that
the
end
of
life
is
not
the
end
of
our
misery
abbe
and
you
do
know
it
jeanne
where
can
i
find
out
abbe
hm
the
next
time
you
feel
as
if
you
wanted
to
learn
about
this
matter
you
can
look
me
up
in
our
lady
chapel
at
the
church
of
germain
here
comes
the
one
you
are
waiting
for
i
guess
jeanne
embarrassed
no
he
is
not
the
one
but
i
know
him
abbe
to
marion
little
marion
may
god
take
care
of
you
kisses
the
child
and
goes
out
at
germain
des
pres
emile
enters
good
morning
sister
what
are
you
doing
here
jeanne
i
am
waiting
for
maurice
emile
then
i
guess
you
have
a
lot
of
waiting
to
do
for
i
saw
him
on
the
boulevard
an
hour
ago
taking
breakfast
with
some
friends
kissing
the
child
good
morning
marion
jeanne
ladies
also
emile
of
course
but
that
does
mean
anything
he
writes
plays
and
his
latest
one
has
its
first
performance
tonight
i
suppose
he
had
with
him
some
of
the
actresses
jeanne
did
he
recognise
you
emile
no
he
does
know
who
i
am
and
it
is
just
as
well
i
know
my
place
as
a
workman
and
i
do
care
for
any
condescension
from
those
that
are
above
me
jeanne
but
if
he
leaves
us
without
anything
to
live
on
emile
well
you
see
when
it
gets
that
far
then
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
introduce
myself
but
you
do
expect
anything
of
the
kind
do
you
seeing
that
he
is
fond
of
you
and
very
much
attached
to
the
child
jeanne
i
do
know
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
something
dreadful
is
in
store
for
me
emile
has
he
promised
to
marry
you
jeanne
no
not
promised
exactly
but
he
has
held
out
hopes
emile
hopes
yes
do
you
remember
my
words
at
the
start
do
hope
for
anything
for
those
above
us
do
marry
downward
jeanne
but
such
things
have
happened
emile
yes
they
have
happened
but
would
you
feel
at
home
in
his
world
i
ca
believe
it
for
you
would
even
understand
what
they
were
talking
of
now
and
then
i
take
my
meals
where
he
is
eating
out
in
the
kitchen
is
my
place
of
course
and
i
do
make
out
a
word
of
what
they
say
jeanne
so
you
take
your
meals
at
that
place
emile
yes
in
the
kitchen
jeanne
and
think
of
it
he
has
never
asked
me
to
come
with
him
emile
well
that
rather
to
his
credit
and
it
shows
he
has
some
respect
for
the
mother
of
his
child
the
women
over
there
are
a
queer
lot
jeanne
is
that
so
emile
but
maurice
never
pays
any
attention
to
the
women
there
is
something
square
about
that
fellow
jeanne
that
what
i
feel
about
him
too
but
as
soon
as
there
is
a
woman
in
it
a
man
is
himself
any
longer
emile
smiling
you
do
tell
me
but
listen
are
you
hard
up
for
money
jeanne
no
nothing
of
that
kind
emile
well
then
the
worst
has
come
yet
look
over
there
there
he
comes
and
i
leave
you
little
girl
jeanne
is
he
coming
yes
that
him
emile
do
make
him
mad
now
with
your
jealousy
jeanne
goes
out
jeanne
no
i
wo
maurice
enters
marion
runs
up
to
him
and
is
lifted
up
into
his
arms
papa
papa
maurice
my
little
girl
greets
jeanne
can
you
forgive
me
jeanne
that
i
have
kept
you
waiting
so
long
jeanne
of
course
i
can
maurice
but
say
it
in
such
a
way
that
i
can
hear
that
you
are
forgiving
me
jeanne
come
here
and
let
me
whisper
it
to
you
maurice
goes
up
close
to
her
jeanne
kisses
him
on
the
cheek
maurice
i
did
hear
jeanne
kisses
him
on
the
mouth
maurice
now
i
heard
well
you
know
i
suppose
that
this
is
the
day
that
will
settle
my
fate
my
play
is
on
for
tonight
and
there
is
every
chance
that
it
will
succeed
or
fail
jeanne
i
make
sure
of
success
by
praying
for
you
maurice
thank
you
if
it
does
help
it
can
at
least
do
no
harm
look
over
there
down
there
in
the
valley
where
the
haze
is
thickest
there
lies
paris
today
paris
does
know
who
maurice
is
but
it
is
going
to
know
within
hours
the
haze
which
has
kept
me
obscured
for
thirty
years
will
vanish
before
my
breath
and
i
shall
become
visible
i
shall
assume
definite
shape
and
begin
to
be
somebody
my
enemies
which
means
all
who
would
like
to
do
what
i
have
done
will
be
writhing
in
pains
that
shall
be
my
pleasures
for
they
will
be
suffering
all
that
i
have
suffered
jeanne
do
talk
that
way
do
maurice
but
that
the
way
it
is
jeanne
yes
but
do
speak
of
it
and
then
maurice
then
we
are
on
firm
ground
and
then
you
and
marion
will
bear
the
name
i
have
made
famous
jeanne
you
love
me
then
maurice
i
love
both
of
you
equally
much
or
perhaps
marion
a
little
more
jeanne
i
am
glad
of
it
for
you
can
grow
tired
of
me
but
not
of
her
maurice
have
you
no
confidence
in
my
feelings
toward
you
jeanne
i
do
know
but
i
am
afraid
of
something
afraid
of
something
terrible
maurice
you
are
tired
out
and
depressed
by
your
long
wait
which
once
more
i
ask
you
to
forgive
what
have
you
to
be
afraid
of
jeanne
the
unexpected
that
which
you
may
foresee
without
having
any
particular
reason
to
do
so
maurice
but
i
foresee
only
success
and
i
have
particular
reasons
for
doing
so
the
keen
instincts
of
the
management
and
their
knowledge
of
the
public
not
to
speak
of
their
personal
acquaintance
with
the
critics
so
now
you
must
be
in
good
spirits
jeanne
i
ca
i
ca
do
you
know
there
was
an
abbe
here
a
while
ago
who
talked
so
beautifully
to
us
my
faith
which
you
destroyed
but
just
covered
up
as
when
you
put
chalk
on
a
window
to
clean
it
i
could
lay
hold
on
it
for
that
reason
but
this
old
man
just
passed
his
hand
over
the
chalk
and
the
light
came
through
and
it
was
possible
again
to
see
that
the
people
within
were
at
home
i
will
pray
for
you
at
germain
maurice
now
i
am
getting
scared
jeanne
fear
of
god
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
maurice
god
what
is
that
who
is
he
jeanne
it
was
he
who
gave
joy
to
your
youth
and
strength
to
your
manhood
and
it
is
he
who
will
carry
us
through
the
terrors
that
lie
ahead
of
us
maurice
what
is
lying
ahead
of
us
what
do
you
know
where
have
you
learned
of
this
this
thing
that
i
do
know
jeanne
i
ca
tell
i
have
dreamt
nothing
seen
nothing
heard
nothing
but
during
these
two
dreadful
hours
i
have
experienced
such
an
infinity
of
pain
that
i
am
ready
for
the
worst
marion
now
i
want
to
go
home
mamma
for
i
am
hungry
maurice
yes
you
go
home
now
my
little
darling
takes
her
into
his
arms
marion
shrinking
oh
you
hurt
me
papa
jeanne
yes
we
must
get
home
for
dinner
then
maurice
and
good
luck
to
you
maurice
to
marion
how
did
i
hurt
you
does
my
little
girl
know
that
i
always
want
to
be
nice
to
her
marion
if
you
are
nice
you
come
home
with
us
maurice
to
jeanne
when
i
hear
the
child
talk
like
that
you
know
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
do
what
she
says
but
then
reason
and
duty
protest
my
dear
little
girl
he
kisses
the
child
who
puts
her
arms
around
his
neck
jeanne
when
do
we
meet
again
maurice
we
meet
tomorrow
dear
and
then
we
never
part
again
jeanne
embraces
him
never
never
to
part
again
she
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
may
god
protect
you
maurice
moved
against
his
own
will
my
dear
beloved
jeanne
jeanne
and
marion
go
toward
the
right
maurice
toward
the
left
both
turn
around
simultaneously
and
throw
kisses
at
each
other
maurice
comes
back
jeanne
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
am
always
forgetting
you
and
you
are
the
last
one
to
remind
me
of
it
here
are
the
tickets
for
tonight
jeanne
thank
you
dear
but
you
have
to
take
up
your
post
of
duty
alone
and
so
i
have
to
take
up
mine
with
marion
maurice
your
wisdom
is
as
great
as
the
goodness
of
your
heart
yes
i
am
sure
no
other
woman
would
have
sacrificed
a
pleasure
to
serve
her
husband
i
must
have
my
hands
free
tonight
and
there
is
no
place
for
women
and
children
on
the
and
this
you
understood
jeanne
do
think
too
highly
of
a
poor
woman
like
myself
and
then
you
have
no
illusions
to
lose
and
now
you
see
that
i
can
be
as
forgetful
as
you
i
have
bought
you
a
tie
and
a
pair
of
gloves
which
i
thought
you
might
wear
for
my
sake
on
your
day
of
honour
maurice
kissing
her
hand
thank
you
dear
jeanne
and
then
maurice
do
forget
to
have
your
hair
fixed
as
you
do
all
the
time
i
want
you
to
be
so
that
others
will
like
you
too
maurice
there
is
no
jealousy
in
you
jeanne
do
mention
that
word
for
evil
thoughts
spring
from
it
maurice
just
now
i
feel
as
if
i
could
give
up
this
victory
for
i
am
going
to
win
jeanne
hush
hush
maurice
and
go
home
with
you
instead
jeanne
but
you

do
that
go

mme
catherine
why
that
monsieur
adolphe
friend
maurice
was
that
her
mme
catherine
have
you
never
seen
her
before
maurice
no
he
has
been
hiding
her
from
me
just
as
if
he
was
afraid
i
might
take
her
away
from
him
mme
catherine
well
how
did
you
think
she
looked
maurice
how
she
looked
let
me
see
i
ca
tell
i
did
see
her
for
it
was
as
if
she
had
rushed
straight
into
my
arms
at
once
and
come
so
close
to
me
that
i
could
make
out
her
features
at
all
and
she
left
her
impression
on
the
air
behind
her
i
can
still
see
her
standing
there
he
goes
toward
the
door
and
makes
a
gesture
as
if
putting
his
arm
around
somebody
whew
he
makes
a
gesture
as
if
he
had
pricked
his
finger
there
are
pins
in
her
waist
she
is
of
the
kind
that
stings
mme
catherine
oh
you
are
crazy
you
with
your
ladies
maurice
yes
it
craziness
that
what
it
is
but
do
you
know
madame
catherine
i
am
going
before
she
comes
back
or
else
or
else
oh
that
woman
is
horrible
mme
catherine
are
you
afraid
maurice
yes
i
am
afraid
for
myself
and
also
for
some
others
mme
catherine
well
go
then
maurice
she
seemed
to
suck
herself
out
through
the
door
and
in
her
wake
rose
a
little
whirlwind
that
dragged
me
along
yes
you
may
laugh
but
ca
you
see
that
the
palm
over
there
on
the
buffet
is
still
shaking
she
the
very
devil
of
a
woman
mme
catherine
oh
get
out
of
here
man
before
you
lose
all
your
reason
maurice
i
want
to
go
but
i
can
not
do
you
believe
in
fate
madame
catherine
mme
catherine
no
i
believe
in
a
good
god
who
protects
us
against
evil
powers
if
we
ask
him
in
the
right
way
maurice
so
there
are
evil
powers
after
all
i
think
i
can
hear
them
in
the
hallway
now
mme
catherine
yes
her
clothes
rustle
as
when
the
clerk
tears
off
a
piece
of
linen
for
you
get
away
now
through
the
kitchen
maurice
rushes
toward
the
kitchen
door
where
he
bumps
into
emile
emile
i
beg
your
pardon
he
retires
the
way
he
came
adolphe
comes
in
first
after
him
henriette
why
there
maurice
how
are
you
let
me
introduce
this
lady
here
to
my
oldest
and
best
friend
mademoiselle
henriette
monsieur
maurice
maurice
saluting
stiffly
pleased
to
meet
you
henrietta
we
have
seen
each
other
before
adolphe
is
that
so
when
if
i
may
ask
maurice
a
moment
ago
right
here
adolphe
but
now
you
must
stay
and
have
a
chat
with
us
maurice
after
a
glance
at
mme
catherine
if
i
only
had
time
adolphe
take
the
time
and
we
wo
be
sitting
here
very
long
henriette
i
wo
interrupt
if
you
have
to
talk
business
maurice
the
only
business
we
have
is
so
bad
that
we
do
want
to
talk
of
it
henriette
then
we
talk
of
something
else
takes
the
hat
away
from
maurice
and
hangs
it
up
now
be
nice
and
let
me
become
acquainted
with
the
great
author
mme
catherine
signals
to
maurice
who
does
notice
her
adolphe
that
right
henriette
you
take
charge
of
him
they
seat
themselves
at
one
of
the
tables
henriette
to
maurice
you
certainly
have
a
good
friend
in
adolphe
monsieur
maurice
he
never
talks
of
anything
but
you
and
in
such
a
way
that
i
feel
myself
rather
thrown
in
the
background
adolphe
you
do
say
so
well
henriette
on
her
side
never
leaves
me
in
peace
about
you
maurice
she
has
read
your
works
and
she
is
always
wanting
to
know
where
you
got
this
and
where
that
she
has
been
questioning
me
about
your
looks
your
age
your
tastes
i
have
in
a
word
had
you
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
it
has
almost
seemed
as
if
the
three
of
us
were
living
together
maurice
to
henriette
heavens
why
did
you
come
over
here
and
have
a
look
at
this
wonder
of
wonders
then
your
curiosity
could
have
been
satisfied
in
a
trice
henriette
adolphe
did
want
it
adolphe
looks
embarrassed
henriette
not
that
he
was
jealous
maurice
and
why
should
he
be
when
he
knows
that
my
feelings
are
tied
up
elsewhere
henriette
perhaps
he
did
trust
the
stability
of
your
feelings
maurice
i
ca
understand
that
seeing
that
i
am
notorious
for
my
constancy
adolphe
well
it
was
that
henriette
interrupting
him
perhaps
that
is
because
you
have
not
faced
the
fiery
ordeal
adolphe
oh
you
do
know
henriette
interrupting
for
the
world
has
not
yet
beheld
a
faithful
man
maurice
then
it
going
to
behold
one
henriette
where
maurice
here
henriette
laughs
adolphe
well
that
going
it
henriette
interrupting
him
and
directing
herself
continuously
to
maurice
do
you
think
i
ever
trust
my
dear
adolphe
more
than
a
month
at
a
time
maurice
i
have
no
right
to
question
your
lack
of
confidence
but
i
can
guarantee
that
adolphe
is
faithful
henriette
you
do
need
to
do
so
my
tongue
is
just
running
away
with
me
and
i
have
to
take
back
a
lot
not
only
for
fear
of
feeling
less
generous
than
you
but
because
it
is
the
truth
it
is
a
bad
habit
i
have
of
only
seeing
the
ugly
side
of
things
and
i
keep
it
up
although
i
know
better
but
if
i
had
a
chance
to
be
with
you
two
for
some
time
then
your
company
would
make
me
good
once
more
pardon
me
adolphe
she
puts
her
hand
against
his
cheek
adolphe
you
are
always
wrong
in
your
talk
and
right
in
your
actions
what
you
really
think
that
i
do
know
henriette
who
does
know
that
kind
of
thing
maurice
well
if
we
had
to
answer
for
our
thoughts
who
could
then
clear
himself
henriette
do
you
also
have
evil
thoughts
maurice
certainly
just
as
i
commit
the
worst
kind
of
cruelties
in
my
dreams
henriette
oh
when
you
are
dreaming
of
course
just
think
of
it
no
i
am
ashamed
of
telling
maurice
go
on
go
on
henriette
last
night
i
dreamt
that
i
was
coolly
dissecting
the
muscles
on
adolphe
breast
you
see
i
am
a
sculptor
and
he
with
his
usual
kindness
made
no
resistance
but
helped
me
instead
with
the
worst
places
as
he
knows
more
anatomy
than
maurice
was
he
dead
henriette
no
he
was
living
maurice
but
that
horrible
and
did
it
make
you
suffer
henriette
not
at
all
and
that
astonished
me
most
for
i
am
rather
sensitive
to
other
people
sufferings
is
that
so
adolphe
adolphe
that
right
rather
abnormally
so
in
fact
and
not
the
least
when
animals
are
concerned
maurice
and
i
on
the
other
hand
am
rather
callous
toward
the
sufferings
both
of
myself
and
others
adolphe
now
he
is
not
telling
the
truth
about
himself
or
what
do
you
say
madame
catherine
mme
catherine
i
do
know
of
anybody
with
a
softer
heart
than
monsieur
maurice
he
came
near
calling
in
the
police
because
i
give
the
goldfish
fresh
water
those
over
there
on
the
buffet
just
look
at
them
it
is
as
if
they
could
hear
what
i
am
saying
maurice
yes
here
we
are
making
ourselves
out
as
white
as
angels
and
yet
we
are
taking
it
all
in
all
capable
of
any
kind
of
polite
atrocity
the
moment
glory
gold
or
women
are
concerned
so
you
are
a
sculptor
mademoiselle
henriette
henriette
a
bit
of
one
enough
to
do
a
bust
and
to
do
one
of
you
which
has
long
been
my
cherished
dream
i
hold
myself
quite
capable
maurice
go
ahead
that
dream
at
least
need
not
be
long
in
coming
true
henriette
but
i
do
want
to
fix
your
features
in
my
mind
until
this
evening
success
is
over
not
until
then
will
you
have
become
what
you
should
be
maurice
how
sure
you
are
of
victory
henriette
yes
it
is
written
on
your
face
that
you
are
going
to
win
this
battle
and
i
think
you
must
feel
that
yourself
maurice
why
do
you
think
so
henriette
because
i
can
feel
it
this
morning
i
was
ill
you
know
and
now
i
am
well
adolphe
begins
to
look
depressed
maurice
embarrassed
listen
i
have
a
single
ticket
left
only
one
i
place
it
at
your
disposal
adolphe
adolphe
thank
you
but
i
surrender
it
to
henriette
henriette
but
that
would
do
adolphe
why
not
and
i
never
go
to
the
theatre
anyhow
as
i
can
not
stand
the
heat
henriette
but
you
will
come
and
take
us
home
at
least
after
the
show
is
over
adolphe
if
you
insist
on
it
otherwise
maurice
has
to
come
back
here
where
we
shall
all
be
waiting
for
him
maurice
you
can
just
as
well
take
the
trouble
of
meeting
us
in
fact
i
ask
i
beg
you
to
do
so
and
if
you
do
want
to
wait
outside
the
theatre
you
can
meet
us
at
the
auberge
des
adrets
that
settled
then
is
it
adolphe
wait
a
little
you
have
a
way
of
settling
things
to
suit
yourself
before
other
people
have
a
chance
to
consider
them
maurice
what
is
there
to
consider
whether
you
are
to
see
your
lady
home
or
not
adolphe
you
never
know
what
may
be
involved
in
a
simple
act
like
that
but
i
have
a
sort
of
premonition
henriette
hush
hush
hush
do
talk
of
spooks
while
the
sun
is
shining
let
him
come
or
not
as
it
pleases
him
we
can
always
find
our
way
back
here
adolphe
rising
well
now
i
have
to
leave
you
model
you
know
both
of
you
and
good
luck
to
you
maurice
you
will
be
out
on
the
right
side
henriette
henriette
do
you
really
have
to
go
adolphe
i
must
maurice
then
we
meet
later
adolphe
goes
out
saluting
mme
catherine
in
passing
henriette
think
of
it
that
we
should
meet
at
last
maurice
do
you
find
anything
remarkable
in
that
henriette
it
looks
as
if
it
had
to
happen
for
adolphe
has
done
his
best
to
prevent
it
maurice
has
he
henriette
oh
you
must
have
noticed
it
maurice
i
have
noticed
it
but
why
should
you
mention
it
henriette
i
had
to
maurice
no
and
i
do
have
to
tell
you
that
i
wanted
to
run
away
through
the
kitchen
in
order
to
avoid
meeting
you
and
was
stopped
by
a
guest
who
closed
the
door
in
front
of
me
henriette
why
do
you
tell
me
about
it
now
maurice
i
do
know
mme
catherine
upsets
a
number
of
glasses
and
bottles
maurice
that
all
right
madame
catherine
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
henriette
was
that
meant
as
a
signal
or
a
warning
maurice
probably
both
henriette
do
they
take
me
for
a
locomotive
that
has
to
have
flagmen
ahead
of
it
maurice
and
switchmen
the
danger
is
always
greatest
at
the
switches
henriette
how
nasty
you
can
be
mme
catherine
monsieur
maurice
is
nasty
at
all
so
far
nobody
has
been
kinder
than
he
to
those
that
love
him
and
trust
in
him
maurice
sh
sh
sh
henriette
to
maurice
the
old
lady
is
rather
impertinent
maurice
we
can
walk
over
to
the
boulevard
if
you
care
to
do
so
henriette
with
pleasure
this
is
not
the
place
for
me
i
can
just
feel
their
hatred
clawing
at
me
goes
out
maurice
starts
after
her
madame
catherine
mme
catherine
a
moment
may
i
speak
a
word
to
you
monsieur
maurice
maurice
stops
unwillingly
what
is
it
mme
catherine
do
do
it
do
do
it
maurice
what
mme
catherine
do
do
it
maurice
do
be
scared
this
lady
is
not
my
kind
but
she
interests
me
or
hardly
that
even
mme
catherine
do
trust
yourself
maurice
yes
i
do
trust
myself

a
cafe
in
sixteenth
century
style
with
a
suggestion
of
stage
effect
tables
and
are
scattered
in
corners
and
nooks
the
walls
are
decorated
with
armour
and
weapons
along
the
ledge
of
the
wainscoting
stand
glasses
and

maurice
and
henriette
are
in
evening
dress
and
sit
facing
each
other
at
a
table
on
which
stands
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
three
filled
glasses
the
third
glass
is
placed
at
that
side
of
the
table
which
is
nearest
the
background
and
there
an
is
kept
ready
for
the
still
missing
third
man
maurice
puts
his
watch
in
front
of
himself
on
the
table
if
he
get
here
within
the
next
five
minutes
he
is
coming
at
all
and
suppose
in
the
meantime
we
drink
with
his
ghost
touches
the
third
glass
with
the
rim
of
his
own
henriette
doing
the
same
here
to
you
adolphe
maurice
he
wo
come
henriette
he
will
come
maurice
he
wo
henriette
he
will
maurice
what
an
evening
what
a
wonderful
day
i
can
hardly
grasp
that
a
new
life
has
begun
think
only
the
manager
believes
that
i
may
count
on
no
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
francs
i
spend
twenty
thousand
on
a
villa
outside
the
city
that
leaves
me
eighty
thousand
i
wo
be
able
to
take
it
all
in
until
for
i
am
tired
tired
tired
sinks
back
into
the
chair
have
you
ever
felt
really
happy
henriette
never
how
does
it
feel
maurice
i
do
quite
know
how
to
put
it
i
can
not
express
it
but
i
seem
chiefly
to
be
thinking
of
the
chagrin
of
my
enemies
it
is
nice
but
that
the
way
it
is
henriette
is
it
happiness
to
be
thinking
of
one
enemies
maurice
why
the
victor
has
to
count
his
killed
and
wounded
enemies
in
order
to
gauge
the
extent
of
his
victory
henriette
are
you
as
bloodthirsty
as
all
that
maurice
perhaps
not
but
when
you
have
felt
the
pressure
of
other
people
heels
on
your
chest
for
years
it
must
be
pleasant
to
shake
off
the
enemy
and
draw
a
full
breath
at
last
henriette
do
you
find
it
strange
that
you
are
sitting
here
alone
with
me
an
insignificant
girl
practically
unknown
to
you
and
on
an
evening
like
this
when
you
ought
to
have
a
craving
to
show
yourself
like
a
triumphant
hero
to
all
the
people
on
the
boulevards
in
the
big
restaurants
maurice
of
course
it
rather
funny
but
it
feels
good
to
be
here
and
your
company
is
all
i
care
for
henriette
you
do
look
very
hilarious
maurice
no
i
feel
rather
sad
and
i
should
like
to
weep
a
little
henriette
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
maurice
it
is
fortune
conscious
of
its
own
nothingness
and
waiting
for
misfortune
to
appear
henriette
oh
my
how
sad
what
is
it
you
are
missing
anyhow
maurice
i
miss
the
only
thing
that
gives
value
to
life
henriette
so
you
love
her
no
longer
then
maurice
not
in
the
way
i
understand
love
do
you
think
she
has
read
my
play
or
that
she
wants
to
see
it
oh
she
is
so
good
so
and
considerate
but
to
go
out
with
me
for
a
fun
she
would
regard
as
sinful
once
i
treated
her
to
champagne
you
know
and
instead
of
feeling
happy
over
it
she
picked
up
the
wine
list
to
see
what
it
cost
and
when
she
read
the
price
she
wept
wept
because
marion
was
in
need
of
new
stockings
it
is
beautiful
of
course
it
is
touching
if
you
please
but
i
can
get
no
pleasure
out
of
it
and
i
do
want
a
little
pleasure
before
life
runs
out
so
far
i
have
had
nothing
but
privation
but
now
now
life
is
beginning
for
me
the
clock
strikes
twelve
now
begins
a
new
day
a
new
era
henriette
adolphe
is
not
coming
maurice
no
now
he
wo
come
and
now
it
is
too
late
to
go
back
to
the
cremerie
henriette
but
they
are
waiting
for
you
maurice
let
them
wait
they
have
made
me
promise
to
come
and
i
take
back
my
promise
are
you
longing
to
go
there
henriette
on
the
contrary
maurice
will
you
keep
me
company
then
henriette
with
pleasure
if
you
care
to
have
me
maurice
otherwise
i
should
be
asking
you
it
is
strange
you
know
that
the
victor
wreath
seems
worthless
if
you
ca
place
it
at
the
feet
of
some
woman
that
everything
seems
worthless
when
you
have
not
a
woman
henriette
you
do
need
to
be
without
a
woman
you
maurice
well
that
the
question
henriette
do
you
know
that
a
man
is
irresistible
in
his
hour
of
success
and
fame
maurice
no
i
do
know
for
i
have
had
no
experience
of
it
henriette
you
are
a
queer
sort
at
this
moment
when
you
are
the
most
envied
man
in
paris
you
sit
here
and
brood
perhaps
your
conscience
is
troubling
you
because
you
have
neglected
that
invitation
to
drink
chicory
coffee
with
the
old
lady
over
at
the
milk
shop
maurice
yes
my
conscience
is
troubling
me
on
that
score
and
even
here
i
am
aware
of
their
resentment
their
hurt
feelings
their
anger
my
comrades
in
distress
had
the
right
to
demand
my
presence
this
evening
the
good
madame
catherine
had
a
privileged
claim
on
my
success
from
which
a
glimmer
of
hope
was
to
spread
over
the
poor
fellows
who
have
not
yet
succeeded
and
i
have
robbed
them
of
their
faith
in
me
i
can
hear
the
vows
they
have
been
making
maurice
will
come
for
he
is
a
good
fellow
he
does
despise
us
and
he
never
fails
to
keep
his
word
now
i
have
made
them
forswear
themselves
while
he
is
still
speaking
somebody
in
the
next
room
has
begun
to
play
the
finale
of
beethoven
sonata
in
op
no
the
allegretto
is
first
played
piano
then
more
forte
and
at
last
passionately
violently
with
complete
abandon
maurice
who
can
be
playing
at
this
time
of
the
night
henriette
probably
some
nightbirds
of
the
same
kind
as
we
but
listen
your
presentation
of
the
case
is
not
correct
remember
that
adolphe
promised
to
meet
us
here
we
waited
for
him
and
he
failed
to
keep
his
promise
so
that
you
are
not
to
blame
maurice
you
think
so
while
you
are
speaking
i
believe
you
but
when
you
stop
my
conscience
begins
again
what
have
you
in
that
package
henriette
oh
it
is
only
a
laurel
wreath
that
i
meant
to
send
up
to
the
stage
but
i
had
no
chance
to
do
so
let
me
give
it
to
you
now
it
is
said
to
have
a
cooling
effect
on
burning
foreheads
she
rises
and
crowns
him
with
the
wreath
then
she
kisses
him
on
the
forehead
hail
to
the
victor
maurice
do
henriette
kneeling
hail
to
the
king
maurice
rising
no
now
you
scare
me
henriette
you
timid
man
you
of
little
faith
who
are
afraid
of
fortune
even
who
robbed
you
of
your
and
turned
you
into
a
dwarf
maurice
a
dwarf
yes
you
are
right
i
am
not
working
up
in
the
clouds
like
a
giant
with
crashing
and
roaring
but
i
forge
my
weapons
deep
down
in
the
silent
heart
of
the
mountain
you
think
that
my
modesty
shrinks
before
the
victor
wreath
on
the
contrary
i
despise
it
it
is
not
enough
for
me
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
that
ghost
with
its
jealous
green
eyes
which
sits
over
there
and
keeps
watch
on
my
feelings
the
strength
of
which
you
do
suspect
away
ghost
he
brushes
the
third
untouched
glass
off
the
table
away
with
you
you
superfluous
third
person
you
absent
one
who
has
lost
your
rights
if
you
ever
had
any
you
stayed
away
from
the
field
of
battle
because
you
knew
yourself
already
beaten
as
i
crush
this
glass
under
my
foot
so
i
will
crush
the
image
of
yourself
which
you
have
reared
in
a
temple
no
longer
yours
henriette
good
that
the
way
well
spoken
my
hero
maurice
now
i
have
sacrificed
my
best
friend
my
most
faithful
helper
on
your
altar
astarte
are
you
satisfied
henriette
astarte
is
a
pretty
name
and
i
keep
it
i
think
you
love
me
maurice
maurice
of
course
i
do
woman
of
evil
omen
you
who
stir
up
courage
with
your
scent
of
blood
whence
do
you
come
and
where
do
you
lead
me
i
loved
you
before
i
saw
you
for
i
trembled
when
i
heard
them
speak
of
you
and
when
i
saw
you
in
the
doorway
your
soul
poured
itself
into
mine
and
when
you
left
i
could
still
feel
your
presence
in
my
arms
i
wanted
to
flee
from
you
but
something
held
me
back
and
this
evening
we
have
been
driven
together
as
the
prey
is
driven
into
the
hunter
net
whose
is
the
fault
your
friend
who
pandered
for
us
henriette
fault
or
no
fault
what
does
it
matter
and
what
does
it
mean
adolphe
has
been
at
fault
in
not
bringing
us
together
before
he
is
guilty
of
having
stolen
from
us
two
weeks
of
bliss
to
which
he
had
no
right
himself
i
am
jealous
of
him
on
your
behalf
i
hate
him
because
he
has
cheated
you
out
of
your
mistress
i
should
like
to
blot
him
from
the
host
of
the
living
and
his
memory
with
him
wipe
him
out
of
the
past
even
make
him
unmade
unborn
maurice
well
we
bury
him
beneath
our
own
memories
we
cover
him
with
leaves
and
branches
far
out
in
the
wild
woods
and
then
we
pile
stone
on
top
of
the
mound
so
that
he
will
never
look
up
again
raising
his
glass
our
fate
is
sealed
woe
unto
us
what
will
come
next
henriette
next
comes
the
new
era
what
have
you
in
that
package
maurice
i
can
not
remember
henriette
opens
the
package
and
takes
out
a
tie
and
a
pair
of
gloves
that
tie
is
a
fright
it
must
have
cost
at
least
fifty
centimes
maurice
snatching
the
things
away
from
her
do
you
touch
them
henriette
they
are
from
her
maurice
yes
they
are
henriette
give
them
to
me
maurice
no
she
better
than
we
better
than
everybody
else
henriette
i
do
believe
it
she
is
simply
stupider
and
stingier
one
who
weeps
because
you
order
champagne
maurice
when
the
child
was
without
stockings
yes
she
is
a
good
woman
henriette
philistine
you
never
be
an
artist
but
i
am
an
artist
and
i
make
a
bust
of
you
with
a
shopkeeper
cap
instead
of
the
laurel
wreath
her
name
is
jeanne
maurice
how
do
you
know
henriette
why
that
the
name
of
all
housekeepers
maurice
henriette
henriette
takes
the
tie
and
the
gloves
and
throws
them
into
the
fireplace
maurice
weakly
astarte
now
you
demand
the
sacrifice
of
women
you
shall
have
them
but
if
you
ask
for
innocent
children
too
then
send
you
packing
henriette
can
you
tell
me
what
it
is
that
binds
you
to
me
maurice
if
i
only
knew
i
should
be
able
to
tear
myself
away
but
i
believe
it
must
be
those
qualities
which
you
have
and
i
lack
i
believe
that
the
evil
within
you
draws
me
with
the
irresistible
lure
of
novelty
henriette
have
you
ever
committed
a
crime
maurice
no
real
one
have
you
henriette
yes
maurice
well
how
did
you
find
it
henriette
it
was
greater
than
to
perform
a
good
deed
for
by
that
we
are
placed
on
equality
with
others
it
was
greater
than
to
perform
some
act
of
heroism
for
by
that
we
are
raised
above
others
and
rewarded
that
crime
placed
me
outside
and
beyond
life
society
and
my
since
then
i
am
living
only
a
partial
life
a
sort
of
dream
life
and
that
why
reality
never
gets
a
hold
on
me
maurice
what
was
it
you
did
henriette
i
wo
tell
for
then
you
would
get
scared
again
maurice
can
you
never
be
found
out
henriette
never
but
that
does
not
prevent
me
from
seeing
frequently
the
five
stones
at
the
place
de
roquette
where
the
scaffold
used
to
stand
and
for
this
reason
i
never
dare
to
open
a
pack
of
cards
as
i
always
turn
up
the
of
diamonds
maurice
was
it
that
kind
of
a
crime
henriette
yes
it
was
that
kind
maurice
of
course
it
horrible
but
it
is
interesting
have
you
no
conscience
henriette
none
but
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
would
talk
of
something
else
maurice
suppose
we
talk
of
love
henriette
of
that
you
do
talk
until
it
is
over
maurice
have
you
been
in
love
with
adolphe
henriette
i
do
know
the
goodness
of
his
nature
drew
me
like
some
beautiful
all
but
vanished
memory
of
childhood
yet
there
was
much
about
his
person
that
offended
my
eye
so
that
i
had
to
spend
a
long
time
retouching
altering
adding
subtracting
before
i
could
make
a
presentable
figure
of
him
when
he
talked
i
could
notice
that
he
had
learned
from
you
and
the
lesson
was
often
badly
digested
and
awkwardly
applied
you
can
imagine
then
how
miserable
the
copy
must
appear
now
when
i
am
permitted
to
study
the
original
that
why
he
was
afraid
of
having
us
two
meet
and
when
it
did
happen
he
understood
at
once
that
his
time
was
up
maurice
poor
adolphe
henriette
i
feel
sorry
for
him
too
as
i
know
he
must
be
suffering
beyond
all
bounds
maurice
sh
somebody
is
coming
henriette
i
wonder
if
it
could
be
he
maurice
that
would
be
unbearable
henriette
no
it
is
he
but
if
it
had
been
how
do
you
think
the
situation
would
have
shaped
itself
maurice
at
first
he
would
have
been
a
little
sore
at
you
because
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
regard
to
the
and
tried
to
find
us
in
several
other
cafes
but
his
soreness
would
have
changed
into
pleasure
at
finding
us
and
seeing
that
we
had
not
deceived
him
and
in
the
joy
at
having
wronged
us
by
his
suspicions
he
would
love
both
of
us
and
so
it
would
make
him
happy
to
notice
that
we
had
become
such
good
friends
it
had
always
been
his
dream
hm
he
is
making
the
speech
now
his
dream
that
the
three
of
us
should
form
a
triumvirate
that
could
set
the
world
a
great
example
of
friendship
asking
for
nothing
yes
i
trust
you
maurice
partly
because
you
are
my
friend
and
partly
because
your
feelings
are
tied
up
elsewhere
henriette
bravo
you
must
have
been
in
a
similar
situation
before
or
you
could
give
such
a
lifelike
picture
of
it
do
you
know
that
adolphe
is
just
that
kind
of
a
third
person
who
can
not
enjoy
his
mistress
without
having
his
friend
along
maurice
that
why
i
had
to
be
called
in
to
entertain
you
hush
there
is
somebody
outside
it
must
be
he
henriette
no
do
you
know
these
are
the
hours
when
ghosts
walk
and
then
you
can
see
so
many
things
and
hear
them
also
to
keep
awake
at
night
when
you
ought
to
be
sleeping
has
for
me
the
same
charm
as
a
crime
it
is
to
place
oneself
above
and
beyond
the
laws
of
nature
maurice
but
the
punishment
is
fearful
i
am
shivering
or
quivering
with
cold
or
with
fear
henriette
wraps
her
opera
cloak
about
him
put
this
on
it
will
make
you
warm
maurice
that
nice
it
is
as
if
i
were
inside
of
your
skin
as
if
my
body
had
been
melted
up
by
lack
of
sleep
and
were
being
remoulded
in
your
shape
i
can
feel
the
moulding
process
going
on
but
i
am
also
growing
a
new
soul
new
thoughts
and
here
where
your
bosom
has
left
an
impression
i
can
feel
my
own
beginning
to
bulge
during
this
entire
scene
the
pianist
in
the
next
room
has
been
practicing
the
sonata
in
sometimes
pianissimo
sometimes
wildly
fortissimo
now
and
then
he
has
kept
silent
for
a
little
while
and
at
other
times
nothing
has
been
heard
but
a
part
of
the
finale
bars
to
maurice
what
a
monster
to
sit
there
all
night
practicing
on
the
piano
it
gives
me
a
sick
feeling
do
you
know
what
i
propose
let
us
drive
out
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
take
breakfast
in
the
pavilion
and
see
the
sun
rise
over
the
lakes
henriette
bully
maurice
but
first
of
all
i
must
arrange
to
have
my
mail
and
the
morning
papers
sent
out
by
messenger
to
the
pavilion
tell
me
henriette
shall
we
invite
adolphe
henriette
oh
that
going
too
far
but
why
not
the
ass
can
also
be
harnessed
to
the
triumphal
chariot
let
him
come
they
get
up
maurice
taking
off
the
cloak
then
i
ring
henriette
wait
a
moment
throws
herself
into
his
arms
curtain
second
scene
a
large
splendidly
furnished
restaurant
room
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
it
is
richly
carpeted
and
full
of
mirrors
and
divans
there
are
glass
doors
in
the
background
and
beside
them
windows
overlooking
the
lakes
in
the
foreground
a
table
is
spread
with
flowers
in
the
centre
bowls
full
of
fruit
wine
in
decanters
oysters
on
platters
many
different
kinds
of
wine
glasses
and
two
lighted
candelabra
on
the
right
there
is
a
round
table
full
of
newspapers
and
telegrams
maurice
and
henriette
are
sitting
opposite
each
other
at
this
small
table
the
sun
is
just
rising
outside
maurice
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
about
it
the
newspapers
tell
me
it
is
so
and
these
telegrams
congratulate
me
on
my
success
this
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
and
my
fate
is
wedded
to
yours
by
this
night
when
you
were
the
only
one
to
share
my
hopes
and
my
triumph
from
your
hand
i
received
the
laurel
and
it
seems
to
me
as
if
everything
had
come
from
you
henriette
what
a
wonderful
night
have
we
been
dreaming
or
is
this
something
we
have
really
lived
through
maurice
rising
and
what
a
morning
after
such
a
night
i
feel
as
if
it
were
the
world
first
day
that
is
now
being
illumined
by
the
rising
sun
only
this
minute
was
the
earth
created
and
stripped
of
those
white
films
that
are
now
floating
off
into
space
there
lies
the
garden
of
eden
in
the
rosy
light
of
dawn
and
here
is
the
first
human
couple
do
you
know
i
am
so
happy
i
could
cry
at
the
thought
that
all
mankind
is
not
equally
happy
do
you
hear
that
distant
murmur
as
of
ocean
waves
beating
against
a
rocky
shore
as
of
winds
sweeping
through
a
forest
do
you
know
what
it
is
it
is
paris
whispering
my
name
do
you
see
the
columns
of
smoke
that
rise
skyward
in
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
they
are
the
fires
burning
on
my
altars
and
if
that
be
not
so
then
it
must
become
so
for
i
will
it
at
this
moment
all
the
telegraph
instruments
of
europe
are
clicking
out
my
name
the
oriental
express
is
carrying
the
newspapers
to
the
far
east
toward
the
rising
sun
and
the
ocean
steamers
are
carrying
them
to
the
utmost
west
the
earth
is
mine
and
for
that
reason
it
is
beautiful
now
i
should
like
to
have
wings
for
us
two
so
that
we
might
rise
from
here
and
fly
far
far
away
before
anybody
can
soil
my
happiness
before
envy
has
a
chance
to
wake
me
out
of
my
dream
for
it
is
probably
a
dream
henriette
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
here
you
can
feel
that
you
are
not
dreaming
maurice
it
is
not
a
dream
but
it
has
been
one
as
a
poor
young
man
you
know
when
i
was
walking
in
the
woods
down
there
and
looked
up
to
this
pavilion
it
looked
to
me
like
a
fairy
castle
and
always
my
thoughts
carried
me
up
to
this
room
with
the
balcony
outside
and
the
heavy
curtains
as
to
a
place
of
supreme
bliss
to
be
sitting
here
in
company
with
a
beloved
woman
and
see
the
sun
rise
while
the
candles
were
still
burning
in
the
candelabra
that
was
the
most
audacious
dream
of
my
youth
now
it
has
come
true
and
now
i
have
no
more
to
ask
of
life
do
you
want
to
die
now
together
with
me
henriette
no
you
fool
now
i
want
to
begin
living
maurice
rising
to
live
that
is
to
suffer
now
comes
reality
i
can
hear
his
steps
on
the
stairs
he
is
panting
with
alarm
and
his
heart
is
beating
with
dread
of
having
lost
what
it
holds
most
precious
can
you
believe
me
if
i
tell
you
that
adolphe
is
under
this
roof
within
a
minute
he
will
be
standing
in
the
middle
of
this
floor
henriette
alarmed
it
was
a
stupid
trick
to
ask
him
to
come
here
and
i
am
already
regretting
it
well
we
shall
see
anyhow
if
your
forecast
of
the
situation
proves
correct
maurice
oh
it
is
easy
to
be
mistaken
about
a
person
feelings
the
head
waiter
enters
with
a
card
maurice
ask
the
gentleman
to
step
in
to
henriette
i
am
afraid
regret
this
henriette
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
hush
adolphe
enters
pale
and
maurice
trying
to
speak
unconcernedly
there
you
are
what
became
of
you
last
night
adolphe
i
looked
for
you
at
the
hotel
des
arrets
and
waited
a
whole
hour
maurice
so
you
went
to
the
wrong
place
we
were
waiting
several
hours
for
you
at
the
auberge
des
adrets
and
we
are
still
waiting
for
you
as
you
see
adolphe
relieved
thank
heaven
henriette
good
morning
adolphe
you
are
always
expecting
the
worst
and
worrying
yourself
needlessly
i
suppose
you
imagined
that
we
wanted
to
avoid
your
company
and
though
you
see
that
we
sent
for
you
you
are
still
thinking
yourself
superfluous
adolphe
pardon
me
i
was
wrong
but
the
night
was
dreadful
they
sit
down
embarrassed
silence
follows
henriette
to
adolphe
well
are
you
not
going
to
congratulate
maurice
on
his
great
success
adolphe
oh
yes
your
success
is
the
real
thing
and
envy
itself
can
not
deny
it
everything
is
giving
way
before
you
and
even
i
have
a
sense
of
my
own
smallness
in
your
presence
maurice
nonsense
henriette
are
you
not
going
to
offer
adolphe
a
glass
of
wine
adolphe
thank
you
not
for
me
nothing
at
all
henriette
to
adolphe
what
the
matter
with
you
are
you
ill
adolphe
not
yet
but
henriette
your
eyes
adolphe
what
of
them
maurice
what
happened
at
the
cremerie
last
night
i
suppose
they
are
angry
with
me
adolphe
nobody
is
angry
with
you
but
your
absence
caused
a
depression
which
it
hurt
me
to
watch
but
nobody
was
angry
with
you
believe
me
your
friends
understood
and
they
regarded
your
failure
to
come
with
sympathetic
forbearance
madame
catherine
herself
defended
you
and
proposed
your
health
we
all
rejoiced
in
your
success
as
if
it
had
been
our
own
henriette
well
those
are
nice
people
what
good
friends
you
have
maurice
maurice
yes
better
than
i
deserve
adolphe
nobody
has
better
friends
than
he
deserves
and
you
are
a
man
greatly
blessed
in
his
friends
ca
you
feel
how
the
air
is
softened
by
all
the
kind
thoughts
and
wishes
that
stream
toward
you
from
a
thousand
breasts
maurice
rises
in
order
to
hide
his
emotion
adolphe
from
a
thousand
breasts
that
you
have
rid
of
the
nightmare
that
had
been
crushing
them
during
a
lifetime
humanity
had
been
slandered
and
you
have
exonerated
it
that
why
men
feel
grateful
toward
you
they
are
once
more
holding
their
heads
high
and
saying
you
see
we
are
a
little
better
than
our
reputation
after
all
and
that
thought
makes
them
better
henriette
tries
to
hide
her
emotion
adolphe
am
i
in
the
way
just
let
me
warm
myself
a
little
in
your
sunshine
maurice
and
then
i
go
maurice
why
should
you
go
when
you
have
only
just
arrived
adolphe
why
because
i
have
seen
what
i
need
not
have
seen
because
i
know
now
that
my
hour
is
past
pause
that
you
sent
for
me
i
take
as
an
expression
of
thoughtfulness
a
notice
of
what
has
happened
a
frankness
that
hurts
less
than
deceit
you
hear
that
i
think
well
of
my
and
this
i
have
learned
from
you
maurice
pause
but
my
friend
a
few
moments
ago
i
passed
through
the
church
of
germain
and
there
i
saw
a
woman
and
a
child
i
am
not
wishing
that
you
had
seen
them
for
what
has
happened
can
not
be
altered
but
if
you
gave
a
thought
or
a
word
to
them
before
you
set
them
adrift
on
the
waters
of
the
great
city
then
you
could
enjoy
your
happiness
undisturbed
and
now
i
bid
you
henriette
why
must
you
go
adolphe
and
you
ask
that
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
henriette
no
i
do
adolphe
then
goes
out
maurice
the
fall
and
lo
they
knew
that
they
were
naked
henriette
what
a
difference
between
this
scene
and
the
one
we
imagined
he
is
better
than
we
maurice
it
seems
to
me
now
as
if
all
the
rest
were
better
than
we
henriette
do
you
see
that
the
sun
has
vanished
behind
clouds
and
that
the
woods
have
lost
their
rose
colour
maurice
yes
i
see
and
the
blue
lake
has
turned
black
let
us
flee
to
some
place
where
the
sky
is
always
blue
and
the
trees
are
always
green
henriette
yes
let
us
but
without
any
farewells
maurice
no
with
farewells
henriette
we
were
to
fly
you
spoke
of
wings
and
your
feet
are
of
lead
i
am
not
jealous
but
if
you
go
to
say
farewell
and
get
two
pairs
of
arms
around
your
neck
then
you
ca
tear
yourself
away
maurice
perhaps
you
are
right
but
only
one
pair
of
little
arms
is
needed
to
hold
me
fast
henriette
it
is
the
child
that
holds
you
then
and
not
the
woman
maurice
it
is
the
child
henriette
the
child
another
woman
child
and
for
the
sake
of
it
i
am
to
suffer
why
must
that
child
block
the
way
where
i
want
to
pass
and
must
pass
maurice
yes
why
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
never
existed
henriette
walks
excitedly
back
and
forth
indeed
but
now
it
does
exist
like
a
rock
on
the
road
a
rock
set
firmly
in
the
ground
immovable
so
that
it
upsets
the
carriage
maurice
the
triumphal
chariot
the
ass
is
driven
to
death
but
the
rock
remains
curse
it
pause
henriette
there
is
nothing
to
do
maurice
yes
we
must
get
married
and
then
our
child
will
make
us
forget
the
other
one
henriette
this
will
kill
this
maurice
kill
what
kind
of
word
is
that
henriette
changing
tone
your
child
will
kill
our
love
maurice
no
girl
our
love
will
kill
whatever
stands
in
its
way
but
it
will
not
be
killed
henriette
opens
a
deck
of
cards
lying
on
the
mantlepiece
look
at
it
of
diamonds
the
scaffold
can
it
be
possible
that
our
fates
are
determined
in
advance
that
our
thoughts
are
guided
as
if
through
pipes
to
the
spot
for
which
they
are
bound
without
chance
for
us
to
stop
them
but
i
do
want
it
i
do
want
it
do
you
realise
that
i
must
go
to
the
scaffold
if
my
crime
should
be
discovered
maurice
tell
me
about
your
crime
now
is
the
time
for
it
henriette
no
i
should
regret
it
afterward
and
you
would
despise
me
no
no
no
have
you
ever
heard
that
a
person
could
be
hated
to
death
well
my
father
incurred
the
hatred
of
my
mother
and
my
sisters
and
he
melted
away
like
wax
before
a
fire
ugh
let
us
talk
of
something
else
and
above
all
let
us
get
away
the
air
is
poisoned
here
your
laurels
will
be
withered
the
triumph
will
be
forgotten
and
in
a
week
another
triumphant
hero
will
hold
the
public
attention
away
from
here
to
work
for
new
victories
but
first
of
all
maurice
you
must
embrace
your
child
and
provide
for
its
immediate
future
you
do
have
to
see
the
mother
at
all
maurice
thank
you
your
good
heart
does
you
honour
and
i
love
you
doubly
when
you
show
the
kindness
you
generally
hide
henriette
and
then
you
go
to
the
cremerie
and
say
to
the
old
lady
and
your
friends
leave
no
unsettled
business
behind
to
make
your
mind
heavy
on
our
trip
maurice
i
clear
up
everything
and
we
meet
at
the
railroad
station
henriette
agreed
and
then
away
from
here
away
toward
the
sea
and
the
sun
curtain
act
iii
first
scene
in
the
cremerie
the
gas
is
lit
mme
catherine
is
seated
at
the
counter
adolphe
at
a
table
mme
catherine
such
is
life
monseiur
adolphe
but
you
young
ones
are
always
demanding
too
much
and
then
you
come
here
and
blubber
over
it
afterward
adolphe
no
it
is
that
i
reproach
nobody
and
i
am
as
fond
as
ever
of
both
of
them
but
there
is
one
thing
that
makes
me
sick
at
heart
you
see
i
thought
more
of
maurice
than
of
anybody
else
so
much
that
i
would
have
grudged
him
anything
that
could
give
him
pleasure
but
now
i
have
lost
him
and
it
hurts
me
worse
than
the
loss
of
her
i
have
lost
both
of
them
and
so
my
loneliness
is
made
doubly
painful
and
then
there
is
still
something
else
which
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
clear
up
mme
catherine
do
brood
so
much
work
and
divert
yourself
now
for
instance
do
you
ever
go
to
church
adolphe
what
should
i
do
there
mme
catherine
oh
there
so
much
to
look
at
and
then
there
is
the
music
there
is
nothing
commonplace
about
it
at
least
adolphe
perhaps
not
but
i
do
belong
to
that
fold
i
guess
for
it
never
stirs
me
to
any
devotion
and
then
madame
catherine
faith
is
a
gift
they
tell
me
and
i
have
got
it
yet
mme
catherine
well
wait
till
you
get
it
but
what
is
this
i
heard
a
while
ago
is
it
true
that
you
have
sold
a
picture
in
london
for
a
high
price
and
that
you
have
got
a
medal
adolphe
yes
it
true
mme
catherine
merciful
heavens
and
not
a
word
do
you
say
about
it
adolphe
i
am
afraid
of
fortune
and
besides
it
seems
almost
worthless
to
me
at
this
moment
i
am
afraid
of
it
as
of
a
spectre
it
brings
disaster
to
speak
of
having
seen
it
mme
catherine
you
a
queer
fellow
and
that
what
you
have
always
been
adolphe
not
queer
at
all
but
i
have
seen
so
much
misfortune
come
in
the
wake
of
fortune
and
i
have
seen
how
adversity
brings
out
true
friends
while
none
but
false
ones
appear
in
the
hour
of
success
you
asked
me
if
i
ever
went
to
church
and
i
answered
evasively
this
morning
i
stepped
into
the
church
of
germain
without
really
knowing
why
i
did
so
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
looking
for
somebody
in
there
somebody
to
whom
i
could
silently
offer
my
gratitude
but
i
found
nobody
then
i
dropped
a
gold
coin
in
the
it
was
all
i
could
get
out
of
my
and
that
was
rather
commonplace
i
should
say
mme
catherine
it
was
always
something
and
then
it
was
fine
to
think
of
the
poor
after
having
heard
good
news
adolphe
it
was
neither
fine
nor
anything
else
it
was
something
i
did
because
i
could
help
myself
but
something
more
occurred
while
i
was
in
the
church
i
saw
maurice
girl
friend
jeanne
and
her
child
struck
down
crushed
by
his
triumphal
chariot
they
seemed
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
their
misfortune
mme
catherine
well
children
i
do
know
in
what
kind
of
shape
you
keep
your
consciences
but
how
a
decent
fellow
a
careful
and
considerate
man
like
monsieur
maurice
can
all
of
a
sudden
desert
a
woman
and
her
child
that
is
something
i
can
not
explain
adolphe
nor
can
i
explain
it
and
he
does
seem
to
understand
it
himself
i
met
them
this
morning
and
everything
appeared
quite
natural
to
them
quite
proper
as
if
they
could
imagine
anything
else
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
enjoying
the
satisfaction
of
a
good
deed
or
the
fulfilment
of
a
sacred
duty
there
are
things
madame
catherine
that
we
can
not
explain
and
for
this
reason
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
and
besides
you
saw
how
it
happened
maurice
felt
the
danger
in
the
air
i
foresaw
it
and
tried
to
prevent
their
meeting
maurice
wanted
to
run
away
from
it
but
nothing
helped
why
it
was
as
if
a
plot
had
been
laid
by
some
invisible
power
and
as
if
they
had
been
driven
by
guile
into
each
other
arms
of
course
i
am
disqualified
in
this
case
but
i
would
hesitate
to
pronounce
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
mme
catherine
well
now
to
be
able
to
forgive
as
you
do
that
what
i
call
religion
adolphe
heavens
could
it
be
that
i
am
religious
without
knowing
it
mme
catherine
but
then
to
let
oneself
be
driven
or
tempted
into
evil
as
monsieur
maurice
has
done
means
weakness
or
bad
character
and
if
you
feel
your
strength
failing
you
then
you
ask
for
help
and
then
you
get
it
but
he
was
too
conceited
to
do
that
who
is
this
coming
the
abbe
i
think
adolphe
what
does
he
want
here
abbe
enters
good
evening
madame
good
evening
monsieur
mme
catherine
can
i
be
of
any
service
abbe
has
monsieur
maurice
the
author
been
here
mme
catherine
not
his
play
has
just
been
put
on
and
that
is
probably
keeping
him
busy
abbe
i
have
sad
news
to
bring
him
sad
in
several
respects
mme
catherine
may
i
ask
of
what
kind
abbe
yes
it
no
secret
the
daughter
he
had
with
that
girl
jeanne
is
dead
mme
catherine
dead
adolphe
marion
dead
abbe
yes
she
died
suddenly
this
morning
without
any
previous
illness
mme
catherine
o
lord
who
can
tell
thy
ways
abbe
the
mother
grief
makes
it
necessary
that
monsieur
maurice
look
after
her
so
we
must
try
to
find
him
but
first
a
question
in
confidence
do
you
know
whether
monsieur
maurice
was
fond
of
the
child
or
was
indifferent
to
it
mme
catherine
if
he
was
fond
of
marion
why
all
of
us
know
how
he
loved
her
adolphe
there
no
doubt
about
that
abbe
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
and
it
settles
the
matter
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
mme
catherine
has
there
been
any
doubt
about
it
abbe
yes
unfortunately
it
has
even
been
rumoured
in
the
neighbourhood
that
he
had
abandoned
the
child
and
its
mother
in
order
to
go
away
with
a
strange
woman
in
a
few
hours
this
rumour
has
grown
into
definite
accusations
and
at
the
same
time
the
feeling
against
him
has
risen
to
such
a
point
that
his
life
is
threatened
and
he
is
being
called
a
murderer
mme
catherine
good
god
what
is
this
what
does
it
mean
abbe
now
i
tell
you
my
opinion
i
am
convinced
that
the
man
is
innocent
on
this
score
and
the
mother
feels
as
certain
about
it
as
i
do
but
appearances
are
against
monsieur
maurice
and
i
think
he
will
find
it
rather
hard
to
clear
himself
when
the
police
come
to
question
him
adolphe
have
the
police
got
hold
of
the
matter
abbe
yea
the
police
have
had
to
step
in
to
protect
him
against
all
those
ugly
rumours
and
the
rage
of
the
people
probably
the
commissaire
will
be
here
soon
mme
catherine
to
adolphe
there
you
see
what
happens
when
a
man
can
not
tell
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
and
when
he
trifles
with
vice
god
will
punish
adolphe
then
he
is
more
merciless
than
man
abbe
what
do
you
know
about
that
adolphe
not
very
much
but
i
keep
an
eye
on
what
happens
abbe
and
you
understand
it
also
adolphe
not
yet
perhaps
abbe
let
us
look
more
closely
at
the
matter
oh
here
comes
the
commissaire
commissaire
enters
gentlemen
madame
catherine
i
have
to
trouble
you
for
a
moment
with
a
few
questions
concerning
monsieur
maurice
as
you
have
probably
heard
he
has
become
the
object
of
a
hideous
rumour
which
by
the
by
i
do
believe
in
mme
catherine
none
of
us
believes
in
it
either
commissaire
that
strengthens
my
own
opinion
but
for
his
own
sake
i
must
give
him
a
chance
to
defend
himself
abbe
that
right
and
i
guess
he
will
find
justice
although
it
may
come
hard
commissaire
appearances
are
very
much
against
him
but
i
have
seen
guiltless
people
reach
the
scaffold
before
their
innocence
was
discovered
let
me
tell
you
what
there
is
against
him
the
little
girl
marion
being
left
alone
by
her
mother
was
secretly
visited
by
the
father
who
seems
to
have
made
sure
of
the
time
when
the
child
was
to
be
found
alone
fifteen
minutes
after
his
visit
the
mother
returned
home
and
found
the
child
dead
all
this
makes
the
position
of
the
accused
man
very
unpleasant
the
examination
brought
out
no
signs
of
violence
or
of
poison
but
the
physicians
admit
the
existence
of
new
poisons
that
leave
no
traces
behind
them
to
me
all
this
is
mere
coincidence
of
the
kind
i
frequently
come
across
but
here
something
that
looks
worse
last
night
monsieur
maurice
was
seen
at
the
auberge
des
adrets
in
company
with
a
strange
lady
according
to
the
waiter
they
were
talking
about
crimes
the
place
de
roquette
and
the
scaffold
were
both
mentioned
a
queer
topic
of
conversation
for
a
pair
of
lovers
of
good
breeding
and
good
social
position
but
even
this
may
be
passed
over
as
we
know
by
experience
that
people
who
have
been
drinking
and
losing
a
lot
of
sleep
seem
inclined
to
dig
up
all
the
worst
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
their
souls
far
more
serious
is
the
evidence
given
by
the
head
waiter
as
to
their
champagne
breakfast
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
this
morning
he
says
that
he
heard
them
wish
the
life
out
of
a
child
the
man
is
said
to
have
remarked
that
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
never
existed
to
which
the
woman
replied
indeed
but
now
it
does
exist
and
as
they
went
on
talking
these
words
occurred
this
will
kill
this
and
the
answer
was
kill
what
kind
of
word
is
that
and
also
the
of
diamonds
the
scaffold
the
place
de
roquette
all
this
you
see
will
be
hard
to
get
out
of
and
so
will
the
foreign
journey
planned
for
this
evening
these
are
serious
matters
adolphe
he
is
lost
mme
catherine
that
a
dreadful
story
one
does
know
what
to
believe
abbe
this
is
not
the
work
of
man
god
have
mercy
on
him
adolphe
he
is
in
the
net
and
he
will
never
get
out
of
it
mme
catherine
he
had
no
business
to
get
in
adolphe
do
you
begin
to
suspect
him
also
madame
catherine
mme
catherine
yes
and
no
i
have
got
beyond
having
an
opinion
in
this
matter
have
you
not
seen
angels
turn
into
devils
just
as
you
turn
your
hand
and
then
become
angels
again
commissaire
it
certainly
does
look
queer
however
we
have
to
wait
and
hear
what
explanations
he
can
give
no
one
will
be
judged
unheard
good
evening
gentlemen
good
evening
madame
catherine
goes
out
abbe
this
is
not
the
work
of
man
adolphe
no
it
looks
as
if
demons
had
been
at
work
for
the
undoing
of
man
abbe
it
is
either
a
punishment
for
secret
misdeeds
or
it
is
a
terrible
test
jeanne
enters
dressed
in
mourning
good
evening
pardon
me
for
asking
but
have
you
seen
monsieur
maurice
mme
catherine
no
madame
but
i
think
he
may
be
here
any
minute
you
have
met
him
then
since
jeanne
not
since
this
morning
mme
catherine
let
me
tell
you
that
i
share
in
your
great
sorrow
jeanne
thank
you
madame
to
the
abbe
so
you
are
here
father
abbe
yes
my
child
i
thought
i
might
be
of
some
use
to
you
and
it
was
fortunate
as
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
speak
to
the
commissaire
jeanne
the
commissaire
he
does
suspect
maurice
also
does
he
abbe
no
he
does
and
none
of
us
here
do
but
appearances
are
against
him
in
a
most
appalling
manner
jeanne
you
mean
on
account
of
the
talk
the
waiters
overheard
it
means
nothing
to
me
who
has
heard
such
things
before
when
maurice
had
had
a
few
drinks
then
it
is
his
custom
to
speculate
on
crimes
and
their
punishment
besides
it
seems
to
have
been
the
woman
in
his
company
who
dropped
the
most
dangerous
remarks
i
should
like
to
have
a
look
into
that
woman
eyes
adolphe
my
dear
jeanne
no
matter
how
much
harm
that
woman
may
have
done
you
she
did
nothing
with
evil
intention
in
fact
she
had
no
intention
whatever
but
just
followed
the
promptings
of
her
nature
i
know
her
to
be
a
good
soul
and
one
who
can
very
well
bear
being
looked
straight
in
the
eye
jeanne
your
judgment
in
this
matter
adolphe
has
great
value
to
me
and
i
believe
what
you
say
it
means
that
i
can
not
hold
anybody
but
myself
responsible
for
what
has
happened
it
is
my
carelessness
that
is
now
being
punished
she
begins
to
cry
abbe
do
accuse
yourself
unjustly
i
know
you
and
the
serious
spirit
in
which
you
have
regarded
your
motherhood
that
your
assumption
of
this
responsibility
had
not
been
sanctioned
by
religion
and
the
civil
law
was
not
your
fault
no
we
are
here
facing
something
quite
different
adolphe
what
then
abbe
who
can
tell
henriette
enters
dressed
in
travelling
suit
adolphe
rises
with
an
air
of
determination
and
goes
to
meet
henriette
you
here
henriette
yes
where
is
maurice
adolphe
do
you
know
or
do
you
henriette
i
know
everything
excuse
me
madame
catherine
but
i
was
ready
to
start
and
absolutely
had
to
step
in
here
a
moment
to
adolphe
who
is
that
woman
oh
henriette
and
jeanne
stare
at
each
other
emile
appears
in
the
kitchen
door
henriette
to
jeanne
i
ought
to
say
something
but
it
matters
very
little
for
anything
i
can
say
must
sound
like
an
insult
or
a
mockery
but
if
i
ask
you
simply
to
believe
that
i
share
your
deep
sorrow
as
much
as
anybody
standing
closer
to
you
then
you
must
not
turn
away
from
me
you
must
for
i
deserve
your
pity
if
not
your
forbearance
holds
out
her
hand
jeanne
looks
hard
at
her
i
believe
you
now
and
in
the
next
moment
i
do
takes
henriette
hand
henriette
kisses
jeanne
hand
thank
you
jeanne
drawing
back
her
hand
oh
do
i
do
deserve
it
i
deserve
it
abbe
pardon
me
but
while
we
are
gathered
here
and
peace
seems
to
prevail
temporarily
at
least
wo
you
mademoiselle
henriette
shed
some
light
into
all
the
uncertainty
and
darkness
surrounding
the
main
point
of
accusation
i
ask
you
as
a
friend
among
friends
to
tell
us
what
you
meant
with
all
that
talk
about
killing
and
crime
and
the
place
de
roquette
that
your
words
had
no
connection
with
the
death
of
the
child
we
have
reason
to
believe
but
it
would
give
us
added
assurance
to
hear
what
you
were
really
talking
about
wo
you
tell
us
henriette
after
a
pause
that
i
can
not
tell
no
i
can
not
adolphe
henriette
do
tell
give
us
the
word
that
will
relieve
us
all
henriette
i
can
not
do
ask
me
abbe
this
is
not
the
work
of
man
henriette
oh
that
this
moment
had
to
come
and
in
this
manner
to
jeanne
madame
i
swear
that
i
am
not
guilty
of
your
child
death
is
that
enough
jeanne
enough
for
us
but
not
for
justice
henriette
justice
if
you
knew
how
true
your
words
are
abbe
to
henriette
and
if
you
knew
what
you
were
saying
just
now
henriette
do
you
know
that
better
than
i
abbe
yes
i
do
henriette
looks
fixedly
at
the
abbe
abbe
have
no
fear
for
even
if
i
guess
your
secret
it
will
not
be
exposed
besides
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
human
justice
but
a
great
deal
with
divine
mercy
maurice
enters
hastily
dressed
for
travelling
he
does
look
at
the
others
who
are
standing
in
the
background
but
goes
straight
up
to
the
counter
where
mme
catherine
is
sitting
you
are
not
angry
at
me
madame
catherine
because
i
did
show
up
i
have
come
now
to
apologise
to
you
before
i
start
for
the
south
at
eight
this
evening
mme
catherine
is
too
startled
to
say
a
word
maurice
then
you
are
angry
at
me
looks
around
what
does
all
this
mean
is
it
a
dream
or
what
is
it
of
course
i
can
see
that
it
is
all
real
but
it
looks
like
a
wax
cabinet
there
is
jeanne
looking
like
a
statue
and
dressed
in
black
and
henriette
looking
like
a
corpse
what
does
it
mean
all
remain
silent
maurice
nobody
answers
it
must
mean
something
dreadful
silence
but
speak
please
adolphe
you
are
my
friend
what
is
it
pointing
to
emile
and
there
is
a
detective
adolphe
comes
forward
you
do
know
then
maurice
nothing
at
all
but
i
must
know
adolphe
well
then
marion
is
dead
maurice
marion
dead
adolphe
yes
she
died
this
morning
maurice
to
jeanne
so
that
why
you
are
in
mourning
jeanne
jeanne
who
has
done
this
to
us
jeanne
he
who
holds
life
and
death
in
his
hand
maurice
but
i
saw
her
looking
well
and
happy
this
morning
how
did
it
happen
who
did
it
somebody
must
have
done
it
his
eyes
seek
henriette
adolphe
do
look
for
the
guilty
one
here
for
there
is
none
to
he
found
unfortunately
the
police
have
turned
their
suspicion
in
a
direction
where
none
ought
to
exist
maurice
what
direction
is
that
adolphe
well
you
may
as
well
know
that
your
reckless
talk
last
night
and
this
morning
has
placed
you
in
a
light
that
is
anything
but
favourable
maurice
so
they
were
listening
to
us
let
me
see
what
were
we
saying
i
remember
then
i
am
lost
adolphe
but
if
you
explain
your
thoughtless
words
we
will
believe
you
maurice
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
i
shall
be
sent
to
prison
but
it
does
matter
marion
is
dead
dead
and
i
have
killed
her
general
consternation
adolphe
think
of
what
you
are
saying
weigh
your
words
do
you
realise
what
you
said
just
now
maurice
what
did
i
say
adolphe
you
said
that
you
had
killed
marion
maurice
is
there
a
human
being
here
who
could
believe
me
a
murderer
and
who
could
hold
me
capable
of
taking
my
own
child
life
you
who
know
me
madame
catherine
tell
me
do
you
believe
can
you
believe
mme
catherine
i
do
know
any
longer
what
to
believe
what
the
heart
thinketh
the
tongue
speaketh
and
your
tongue
has
spoken
evil
words
maurice
she
does
believe
me
adolphe
but
explain
your
words
man
explain
what
you
meant
by
saying
that
your
love
would
kill
everything
that
stood
in
its
way
maurice
so
they
know
that
too
are
you
willing
to
explain
it
henriette
henriette
no
i
can
not
do
that
abbe
there
is
something
wrong
behind
all
this
and
you
have
lost
our
sympathy
my
friend
a
while
ago
i
could
have
sworn
that
you
were
innocent
and
i
would
do
that
now
maurice
to
jeanne
what
you
have
to
say
means
more
to
me
than
anything
else
jeanne
coldly
answer
a
question
first
who
was
it
you
cursed
during
that
orgie
out
there
maurice
have
i
done
that
too
maybe
yes
i
am
guilty
and
yet
i
am
guiltless
let
me
go
away
from
here
for
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
and
i
have
done
more
wrong
than
i
can
forgive
myself
henriette
to
adolphe
go
with
him
and
see
that
he
does
do
himself
any
harm
adolphe
shall
i
henriette
who
else
adolphe
without
bitterness
you
are
nearest
to
it
sh
a
carriage
is
stopping
outside
mme
catherine
it
the
commissaire
well
much
as
i
have
seen
of
life
i
could
never
have
believed
that
success
and
fame
were
such
things
maurice
to
henriette
from
the
triumphal
chariot
to
the
patrol
wagon
jeanne
simply
and
the
ass
who
was
that
adolphe
oh
that
must
have
been
me
commissaire
enters
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
a
summons
to
police
headquarters
at
once
for
monsieur
maurice
gerard
and
for
mademoiselle
henrietta
mauclerc
both
here
maurice
and
henriette
yes
maurice
is
this
an
arrest
commissaire
not
yet
only
a
summons
maurice
and
then
commissaire
we
do
know
yet
maurice
and
henriette
go
toward
the
door
maurice
to
all
everybody
shows
emotion
the
commissaire
maurice
and
henriette
go
out
emile
enters
and
goes
up
to
jeanne
now
i
take
you
home
sister
jeanne
and
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
emile
the
man
is
innocent
abbe
but
as
i
see
it
it
is
and
must
always
be
something
despicable
to
break
one
promise
and
it
becomes
unpardonable
when
a
woman
and
her
child
are
involved
emile
well
i
should
rather
feel
that
way
too
now
when
it
concerns
my
own
sister
but
unfortunately
i
am
prevented
from
throwing
the
first
stone
because
i
have
done
the
same
thing
myself
abbe
although
i
am
free
from
blame
in
that
respect
i
am
not
throwing
any
stones
either
but
the
act
condemns
itself
and
is
punished
by
its
consequences
jeanne
pray
for
him
for
both
of
them
abbe
no
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
for
it
is
an
impertinence
to
want
to
change
the
counsels
of
the
lord
and
what
has
happened
here
is
indeed
not
the
work
of
man
curtain
second
scene
the
auberge
des
adrets
adolphe
and
henriette
are
seated
at
the
same
table
where
maurice
and
henriette
were
sitting
in
the
second
act
a
cup
of
coffee
stands
in
front
of
adolphe
henriette
has
ordered
nothing
adolphe
you
believe
then
that
he
will
come
here
henriette
i
am
sure
he
was
released
this
noon
for
lack
of
evidence
but
he
did
want
to
show
himself
in
the
streets
before
it
was
dark
adolphe
poor
fellow
oh
i
tell
you
life
seems
horrible
to
me
since
yesterday
henriette
and
what
about
me
i
am
afraid
to
live
dare
hardly
breathe
dare
hardly
think
even
since
i
know
that
somebody
is
spying
not
only
on
my
words
but
on
my
thoughts
adolphe
so
it
was
here
you
sat
that
night
when
i
could
find
you
henriette
yes
but
do
talk
of
it
i
could
die
from
shame
when
i
think
of
it
adolphe
you
are
made
of
a
different
a
better
stuff
than
he
or
i
adolphe
sh
sh
sh
henriette
yes
indeed
and
what
was
it
that
made
me
stay
here
i
was
lazy
i
was
tired
his
success
intoxicated
me
and
bewitched
me
i
can
not
explain
it
but
if
you
had
come
it
would
never
have
happened
and
you
are
great
and
he
is
small
less
than
the
least
of
all
yesterday
he
had
one
hundred
thousand
francs
he
has
nothing
because
his
play
has
been
withdrawn
and
public
opinion
will
never
excuse
him
for
his
lack
of
faith
will
be
judged
as
harshly
as
if
he
were
the
murderer
and
those
that
see
farthest
hold
that
the
child
died
from
sorrow
so
that
he
was
responsible
for
it
anyhow
adolphe
you
know
what
my
thoughts
are
in
this
matter
henriette
but
i
should
like
to
know
that
both
of
you
are
spotless
wo
you
tell
me
what
those
dreadful
words
of
yours
meant
it
can
not
be
a
chance
that
your
talk
in
a
festive
moment
like
that
dealt
so
largely
with
killing
and
the
scaffold
henriette
it
was
no
chance
it
was
something
that
had
to
be
said
something
i
can
not
tell
you
probably
because
i
have
no
right
to
appear
spotless
in
your
eyes
seeing
that
i
am
not
spotless
adolphe
all
this
is
beyond
me
henriette
let
us
talk
of
something
else
do
you
believe
there
are
many
unpunished
criminals
at
large
among
us
some
of
whom
may
even
be
our
intimate
friends
adolphe
nervously
why
what
do
you
mean
henriette
do
you
believe
that
every
human
being
at
some
time
or
another
has
been
guilty
of
some
kind
of
act
which
would
fall
under
the
law
if
it
were
discovered
adolphe
yes
i
believe
that
is
true
but
no
evil
act
escapes
being
punished
by
one
own
conscience
at
least
rises
and
unbuttons
his
coat
and
nobody
is
really
good
who
has
not
erred
breathing
heavily
for
in
order
to
know
how
to
forgive
one
must
have
been
in
need
of
forgiveness
i
had
a
friend
whom
we
used
to
regard
as
a
model
man
he
never
spoke
a
hard
word
to
anybody
he
forgave
everything
and
everybody
and
he
suffered
insults
with
a
strange
satisfaction
that
we
explain
at
last
late
in
life
he
gave
me
his
secret
in
a
single
word
i
am
a
penitent
he
sits
down
again
henriette
remains
silent
looking
at
him
with
surprise
adolphe
as
if
speaking
to
himself
there
are
crimes
not
mentioned
in
the
criminal
code
and
these
are
the
worse
ones
for
they
have
to
be
punished
by
ourselves
and
no
judge
could
be
more
severe
than
we
are
against
our
own
selves
henriette
after
a
pause
well
that
friend
of
yours
did
he
find
peace
adolphe
after
endless
he
reached
a
certain
degree
of
composure
but
life
had
never
any
real
pleasures
to
offer
him
he
never
dared
to
accept
any
kind
of
distinction
he
never
dared
to
feel
himself
entitled
to
a
kind
word
or
even
praise
in
a
word
he
could
never
quite
forgive
himself
henriette
never
what
had
he
done
then
adolphe
he
had
wished
the
life
out
of
his
father
and
when
his
father
suddenly
died
the
son
imagined
himself
to
have
killed
him
those
imaginations
were
regarded
as
signs
of
some
mental
disease
and
he
was
sent
to
an
asylum
from
this
he
was
discharged
after
a
time
as
wholly
recovered
as
they
put
it
but
the
sense
of
guilt
remained
with
him
and
so
he
continued
to
punish
himself
for
his
evil
thoughts
henriette
are
you
sure
the
evil
will
can
not
kill
adolphe
you
mean
in
some
mystic
way
henriette
as
you
please
let
it
go
at
mystic
in
my
own
family
i
am
sure
that
my
mother
and
my
sisters
killed
my
father
with
their
hatred
you
see
he
had
the
awful
idea
that
he
must
oppose
all
our
tastes
and
inclinations
wherever
he
discovered
a
natural
gift
he
tried
to
root
it
out
in
that
way
he
aroused
a
resistance
that
accumulated
until
it
became
like
an
electrical
battery
charged
with
hatred
at
last
it
grew
so
powerful
that
he
languished
away
became
depolarised
lost
his
and
in
the
end
came
to
wish
himself
dead
adolphe
and
your
conscience
never
troubled
you
henriette
no
and
furthermore
i
do
know
what
conscience
is
adolphe
you
do
well
then
you
soon
learn
pause
how
do
you
believe
maurice
will
look
when
he
gets
here
what
do
you
think
he
will
say
henriette
yesterday
morning
you
know
he
and
i
tried
to
make
the
same
kind
of
guess
about
you
while
we
were
waiting
for
you
adolphe
well
henriette
we
guessed
entirely
wrong
adolphe
can
you
tell
me
why
you
sent
for
me
henriette
malice
arrogance
outright
cruelty
adolphe
how
strange
it
is
that
you
can
admit
your
faults
and
yet
not
repent
of
them
henriette
it
must
be
because
i
do
feel
quite
responsible
for
them
they
are
like
the
dirt
left
behind
by
things
handled
during
the
day
and
washed
off
at
night
but
tell
me
one
thing
do
you
really
think
so
highly
of
humanity
as
you
profess
to
do
adolphe
yes
we
are
a
little
better
than
our
reputation
and
a
little
worse
henriette
that
is
not
a
straightforward
answer
adolphe
no
it
is
but
are
you
willing
to
answer
me
frankly
when
i
ask
you
do
you
still
love
maurice
henriette
i
can
not
tell
until
i
see
him
but
at
this
moment
i
feel
no
longing
for
him
and
it
seems
as
if
i
could
very
well
live
without
him
adolphe
it
likely
you
could
but
i
fear
you
have
become
chained
to
his
fate
sh
here
he
comes
henriette
how
everything
repeats
itself
the
situation
is
the
same
the
very
words
are
the
same
as
when
we
were
expecting
you
yesterday
maurice
enters
pale
as
death
unshaven
here
i
am
my
dear
friends
if
this
be
me
for
that
last
night
in
a
cell
changed
me
into
a
new
sort
of
being
notices
henriette
and
adolphe
adolphe
sit
down
and
pull
yourself
together
and
then
we
can
talk
things
over
maurice
to
henriette
perhaps
i
am
in
the
way
adolphe
now
do
get
bitter
maurice
i
have
grown
bad
in
these
hours
and
suspicious
also
so
i
guess
i
soon
be
left
to
myself
and
who
wants
to
keep
company
with
a
murderer
henriette
but
you
have
been
cleared
of
the
charge
maurice
picks
up
a
newspaper
by
the
police
yes
but
not
by
public
opinion
here
you
see
the
murderer
maurice
gerard
once
a
playwright
and
his
mistress
henriette
mauclerc
henriette
o
my
mother
and
my
sisters
my
mother
jesus
have
mercy
maurice
and
can
you
see
that
i
actually
look
like
a
murderer
and
then
it
is
suggested
that
my
play
was
stolen
so
there
is
a
vestige
left
of
the
victorious
hero
from
yesterday
in
place
of
my
own
the
name
of
octave
my
enemy
appears
on
the
and
he
is
going
to
collect
my
one
hundred
thousand
francs
o
solon
solon
such
is
fortune
and
such
is
fame
you
are
fortunate
adolphe
because
you
have
not
yet
succeeded
henriette
so
you
do
know
that
adolphe
has
made
a
great
success
in
london
and
carried
off
the
first
prize
maurice
darkly
no
i
did
know
that
is
it
true
adolphe
adolphe
it
is
true
but
i
have
returned
the
prize
henriette
with
emphasis
that
i
did
know
so
you
are
also
prevented
from
accepting
any
distinctions
like
your
friend
adolphe
my
friend
embarrassed
oh
yes
yes
maurice
your
success
gives
me
pleasure
but
it
puts
us
still
farther
apart
adolphe
that
what
i
expected
and
i
suppose
i
be
as
lonely
with
my
success
as
you
with
your
adversity
think
of
it
that
people
feel
hurt
by
your
fortune
oh
it
ghastly
to
be
alive
maurice
you
say
that
what
am
i
then
to
say
it
is
as
if
my
eyes
had
been
covered
with
a
black
veil
and
as
if
the
colour
and
shape
of
all
life
had
been
changed
by
it
this
room
looks
like
the
room
i
saw
yesterday
and
yet
it
is
quite
different
i
recognise
both
of
you
of
course
but
your
faces
are
new
to
me
i
sit
here
and
search
for
words
because
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
i
ought
to
defend
myself
but
i
can
not
and
i
almost
miss
the
cell
for
it
protected
me
at
least
against
the
curious
glances
that
pass
right
through
me
the
murderer
maurice
and
his
mistress
you
do
love
me
any
longer
henriette
and
no
more
do
i
care
for
you
you
are
ugly
clumsy
insipid
repulsive
two
men
in
civilian
clothes
have
quietly
seated
themselves
at
a
table
in
the
background
adolphe
wait
a
little
and
get
your
thoughts
together
that
you
have
been
discharged
and
cleared
of
all
suspicion
must
appear
in
some
of
the
evening
papers
and
that
puts
an
end
to
the
whole
matter
your
play
will
be
put
on
again
and
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
you
can
write
a
new
one
leave
paris
for
a
year
and
let
everything
become
forgotten
you
who
have
exonerated
mankind
will
be
exonerated
yourself
maurice
mankind
adolphe
you
have
ceased
to
believe
in
goodness
maurice
yes
if
i
ever
did
believe
in
it
perhaps
it
was
only
a
mood
a
manner
of
looking
at
things
a
way
of
being
polite
to
the
wild
beasts
when
i
who
was
held
among
the
best
can
be
so
rotten
to
the
core
what
must
then
be
the
wretchedness
of
the
rest
adolphe
now
i
go
out
and
get
all
the
evening
papers
and
then
undoubtedly
have
reason
to
look
at
things
in
a
different
way
maurice
turning
toward
the
background
two
detectives
it
means
that
i
am
released
under
surveillance
so
that
i
can
give
myself
away
by
careless
talking
adolphe
those
are
not
detectives
that
only
your
imagination
i
recognise
both
of
them
goes
toward
the
door
maurice
do
leave
us
alone
adolphe
i
fear
that
henriette
and
i
may
come
to
open
explanations
adolphe
oh
be
sensible
maurice
and
think
of
your
future
try
to
keep
him
quiet
henriette
i
be
back
in
a
moment
goes
out
henriette
well
maurice
what
do
you
think
now
of
our
guilt
or
guiltlessness
maurice
i
have
killed
nobody
all
i
did
was
to
talk
a
lot
of
nonsense
while
i
was
drunk
but
it
is
your
crime
that
comes
back
and
that
crime
you
have
grafted
on
to
me
henriette
oh
that
the
tone
you
talk
in
now
was
it
not
you
who
cursed
your
own
child
and
wished
the
life
out
of
it
and
wanted
to
go
away
without
saying
to
anybody
and
was
it
not
i
who
made
you
visit
marion
and
show
yourself
to
madame
catherine
maurice
yes
you
are
right
forgive
me
you
proved
yourself
more
human
than
i
and
the
guilt
is
wholly
my
own
forgive
me
but
all
the
same
i
am
without
guilt
who
has
tied
this
net
from
which
i
can
never
free
myself
guilty
and
guiltless
guiltless
and
yet
guilty
oh
it
is
driving
me
mad
look
now
they
sit
over
there
and
listen
to
us
and
no
waiter
comes
to
take
our
order
i
go
out
and
order
a
cup
of
tea
do
you
want
anything
henriette
nothing
maurice
goes
out
first

to
henriette

me
look
at
your
papers

dare
you
speak
to
me
detective

i
show
you
henriette
what
do

mean
detective

my
job
to
keep
an
eye
on
yesterday
you
came
here
with
one
man
and
today
with
another
that
as
good
as
walking
the
streets
and
unescorted
ladies
do
get
anything
here
so
you
better
get
out
and
come
along
with
me
henriette
my
escort

be
back
in
a
moment
detective

and
a
pretty
kind
of
escort

the
kind
that
does
help
a
girl

bit
henriette
o
god
my
mother
my
sisters
i
am
of
good
family
i
tell
you
detective
yes
family

am
sure
but
you
are
too
well
known
through
the
papers
come
along
henriette
where
what
do
you
mean
detective
oh
to
the
bureau
of
course
there
you
get
a
nice
little
card
and
a
license
that
brings
you
free
medical
care
henriette
o
lord
jesus
you
do
mean
it
detective
grabbing
henriette
by
the
arm
do
i
mean
it
henriette
falling
on
her
knees
save
me
maurice
help
detective
shut
up
you
fool
maurice
enters
followed
by
waiter
waiter
gentlemen
of
that
kind
are
not
served
here
you
just
pay
and
get
out
and
take
the
girl
along
maurice
crushed
searches
his
for
money
henriette
pay
for
me
and
let
us
get
away
from
this
place
i
have
a
sou
left
waiter
so
the
lady
has
to
put
up
for
her
alphonse
alphonse
do
you
know
what
that
is
henriette
looking
through
her
oh
merciful
heavens
i
have
no
money
either
why
does
adolphe
come
back
detective
well
did
you
ever
see
such
rotters
get
out
of
here
and
put
up
something
as
security
that
kind
of
ladies
generally
have
their
fingers
full
of
rings
maurice
can
it
be
possible
that
we
have
sunk
so
low
henriette
takes
off
a
ring
and
hands
it
to
the
waiter
the
abbe
was
right
this
is
not
the
work
of
man
maurice
no
it
the
devil
but
if
we
leave
before
adolphe
returns
he
will
think
that
we
have
deceived
him
and
run
away
henriette
that
would
be
in
keeping
with
the
rest
but
we
go
into
the
river
now
wo
we
maurice
takes
henriette
by
the
hand
as
they
walk
out
together
into
the
river
yes
curtain
act
iv
first
scene
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
at
the
group
of
adam
and
eve
the
wind
is
shaking
the
trees
and
stirring
up
dead
leaves
straws
and
pieces
of
paper
from
the
ground
maurice
and
henriette
are
seated
on
a
bench
henriette
so
you
do
want
to
die
maurice
no
i
am
afraid
i
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
be
very
cold
down
there
in
the
grave
with
only
a
sheet
to
cover
me
and
a
few
shavings
to
lie
on
and
besides
that
it
seems
to
me
as
if
there
were
still
some
task
waiting
for
me
but
i
can
not
make
out
what
it
is
henriette
but
i
can
guess
what
it
is
maurice
tell
me
henriette
it
is
revenge
you
like
me
must
have
suspected
jeanne
and
emile
of
sending
the
detectives
after
me
yesterday
such
a
revenge
on
a
rival
none
but
a
woman
could
devise
maurice
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
but
let
me
tell
you
that
my
suspicions
go
even
further
it
seems
as
if
my
sufferings
during
these
last
few
days
had
sharpened
my
wits
can
you
explain
for
instance
why
the
waiter
from
the
auberge
des
adrets
and
the
head
waiter
from
the
pavilion
were
not
called
to
testify
at
the
hearing
henriette
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
now
i
know
why
they
had
nothing
to
tell
because
they
had
not
been
listening
maurice
but
how
could
the
commissaire
then
know
what
we
had
been
saying
henriette
he
did
know
but
he
figured
it
out
he
was
guessing
and
he
guessed
right
perhaps
he
had
had
to
deal
with
some
similar
case
before
maurice
or
else
he
concluded
from
our
looks
what
we
had
been
saying
there
are
those
who
can
read
other
people
thoughts
adolphe
being
the
dupe
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
we
should
have
called
him
an
ass
it
the
rule
i
understand
although
it
varied
at
times
by
the
use
of
idiot
instead
but
ass
was
nearer
at
hand
in
this
case
as
we
had
been
talking
of
carriages
and
triumphal
chariots
it
is
quite
simple
to
figure
out
a
fourth
fact
when
you
have
three
known
ones
to
start
from
henriette
just
think
that
we
have
let
ourselves
be
taken
in
so
completely
maurice
that
the
result
of
thinking
too
well
of
one
fellow
beings
this
is
all
you
get
out
of
it
but
do
you
know
suspect
somebody
else
back
of
the
commissaire
who
must
be
a
scoundrel
henriette
you
mean
the
abbe
who
was
taking
the
part
of
a
private
detective
maurice
that
what
i
mean
that
man
has
to
receive
all
kinds
of
confessions
and
note
you
adolphe
himself
told
us
he
had
been
at
the
church
of
germain
that
morning
what
was
he
doing
there
he
was
blabbing
of
course
and
bewailing
his
fate
and
then
the
priest
put
the
questions
together
for
the
commissaire
henriette
tell
me
something
do
you
trust
adolphe
maurice
i
trust
no
human
being
any
longer
henriette
not
even
adolphe
maurice
him
least
of
all
how
could
i
trust
an
enemy
a
man
from
whom
i
have
taken
away
his
mistress
henriette
well
as
you
were
the
first
one
to
speak
of
this
i
give
you
some
data
about
our
friend
you
heard
he
had
returned
that
medal
from
london
do
you
know
his
reason
for
doing
so
maurice
no
henriette
he
thinks
himself
unworthy
of
it
and
he
has
taken
a
penitential
vow
never
to
receive
any
kind
of
distinction
maurice
can
that
he
possible
but
what
has
he
done
henriette
he
has
committed
a
crime
of
the
kind
that
is
not
punishable
under
the
law
that
what
he
gave
me
to
understand
indirectly
maurice
he
too
he
the
best
one
of
all
the
model
man
who
never
speaks
a
hard
word
of
anybody
and
who
forgives
everything
henriette
well
there
you
can
see
that
we
are
no
worse
than
others
and
yet
we
are
being
hounded
day
and
night
as
if
devils
were
after
us
maurice
he
also
then
mankind
has
not
been
slandered
but
if
he
has
been
capable
of
one
crime
then
you
may
expect
anything
of
him
perhaps
it
was
he
who
sent
the
police
after
you
yesterday
coming
to
think
of
it
now
it
was
he
who
sneaked
away
from
us
when
he
saw
that
we
were
in
the
papers
and
he
lied
when
he
insisted
that
those
fellows
were
not
detectives
but
of
course
you
may
expect
anything
from
a
deceived
lover
henriette
could
he
be
as
mean
as
that
no
it
is
impossible
impossible
maurice
why
so
if
he
is
a
scoundrel
what
were
you
two
talking
of
yesterday
before
i
came
henriette
he
had
nothing
but
good
to
say
of
you
maurice
that
a
lie
henriette
controlling
herself
and
changing
her
tone
listen
there
is
one
person
on
whom
you
have
cast
no
suspicion
whatever
for
what
reason
i
do
know
have
you
thought
of
madame
catherine
wavering
attitude
in
this
matter
did
she
say
finally
that
she
believed
you
capable
of
anything
maurice
yes
she
did
and
that
shows
what
kind
of
person
she
is
to
think
evil
of
other
people
without
reason
you
must
be
a
villain
yourself
henriette
looks
hard
at
him
pause
henriette
to
think
evil
of
others
you
must
be
a
villain
yourself
maurice
what
do
you
mean
henriette
what
i
said
maurice
do
you
mean
that
i
henriette
yes
that
what
i
mean
now
look
here
did
you
meet
anybody
but
marion
when
you
called
there
yesterday
morning
maurice
why
do
you
ask
henriette
guess
maurice
well
as
you
seem
to
know
i
met
jeanne
too
henriette
why
did
you
lie
to
me
maurice
i
wanted
to
spare
you
henriette
and
now
you
want
me
to
believe
in
one
who
has
been
lying
to
me
no
my
boy
now
i
believe
you
guilty
of
that
murder
maurice
wait
a
moment
we
have
now
reached
the
place
for
which
my
thoughts
have
been
heading
all
the
time
though
i
resisted
as
long
as
possible
it
queer
that
what
lies
next
to
one
is
seen
last
of
all
and
what
one
does
want
to
believe
can
not
be
believed
tell
me
something
where
did
you
go
yesterday
morning
after
we
parted
in
the
bois
henriette
alarmed
why
maurice
you
went
either
to
adolphe
which
you
could
do
as
he
was
attending
a
lesson
or
you
went
to
marion
henriette
now
i
am
convinced
that
you
are
the
murderer
maurice
and
i
that
you
are
the
murderess
you
alone
had
an
interest
in
getting
the
child
out
of
the
way
to
get
rid
of
the
rock
on
the
road
as
you
so
aptly
put
it
henriette
it
was
you
who
said
that
maurice
and
the
one
who
had
an
interest
in
it
must
have
committed
the
crime
henriette
now
maurice
we
have
been
running
around
and
around
in
this
scourging
each
other
let
us
quit
before
we
get
to
the
point
of
sheer
madness
maurice
you
have
reached
that
point
already
henriette
do
you
think
it
time
for
us
to
part
before
we
drive
each
other
insane
maurice
yes
i
think
so
henriette
rising
then
two
men
in
civilian
clothes
become
visible
in
the
background
henriette
turns
and
comes
back
to
maurice
there
they
are
again
maurice
the
dark
angels
that
want
to
drive
us
out
of
the
garden
henriette
and
force
us
back
upon
each
other
as
if
we
were
chained
together
maurice
or
as
if
we
were
condemned
to
lifelong
marriage
are
we
really
to
marry
to
settle
down
in
the
same
place
to
be
able
to
close
the
door
behind
us
and
perhaps
get
peace
at
last
henriette
and
shut
ourselves
up
in
order
to
torture
each
other
to
death
get
behind
locks
and
bolts
with
a
ghost
for
marriage
portion
you
torturing
me
with
the
memory
of
adolphe
and
i
getting
back
at
you
with
jeanne
and
marion
maurice
never
mention
the
name
of
marion
again
do
you
know
that
she
was
to
be
buried
today
at
this
very
moment
perhaps
henriette
and
you
are
not
there
what
does
that
mean
maurice
it
means
that
both
jeanne
and
the
police
have
warned
me
against
the
rage
of
the
people
henriette
a
coward
too
maurice
all
the
vices
how
could
you
ever
have
cared
for
me
henriette
because
two
days
ago
you
were
another
person
well
worthy
of
being
loved
maurice
and
now
sunk
to
such
a
depth
henriette
it
is
that
but
you
are
beginning
to
flaunt
bad
qualities
which
are
not
your
own
maurice
but
yours
henriette
perhaps
for
when
you
appear
a
little
worse
i
feel
myself
at
once
a
little
better
maurice
it
like
passing
on
a
disease
to
save
one
henriette
and
how
vulgar
you
have
become
too
maurice
yes
i
notice
it
myself
and
i
hardly
recognise
myself
since
that
night
in
the
cell
they
put
in
one
person
and
let
out
another
through
that
gate
which
separates
us
from
the
rest
of
society
and
now
i
feel
myself
the
enemy
of
all
mankind
i
should
like
to
set
fire
to
the
earth
and
dry
up
the
oceans
for
nothing
less
than
a
universal
conflagration
can
wipe
out
my
dishonour
henriette
i
had
a
letter
from
my
mother
today
she
is
the
widow
of
a
major
in
the
army
well
educated
with
ideas
of
honour
and
that
kind
of
thing
do
you
want
to
read
the
letter
no
you
do
do
you
know
that
i
am
an
outcast
my
respectable
acquaintances
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
and
if
i
show
myself
on
the
streets
alone
the
police
will
take
me
do
you
realise
now
that
we
have
to
get
married
maurice
we
despise
each
other
and
yet
we
have
to
marry
that
is
hell
pure
and
simple
but
henriette
before
we
unite
our
destinies
you
must
tell
me
your
secret
so
that
we
may
be
on
more
equal
terms
henriette
all
right
i
tell
you
i
had
a
friend
who
got
into
trouble
you
understand
i
wanted
to
help
her
as
her
whole
future
was
at
stake
and
she
died
maurice
that
was
reckless
but
one
might
almost
call
it
noble
too
henriette
you
say
so
now
but
the
next
time
you
lose
your
temper
you
will
accuse
me
of
it
maurice
no
i
wo
but
i
can
not
deny
that
it
has
shaken
my
faith
in
you
and
that
it
makes
me
afraid
of
you
tell
me
is
her
lover
still
alive
and
does
he
know
to
what
extent
you
were
responsible
henriette
he
was
as
guilty
as
maurice
and
if
his
conscience
should
begin
to
trouble
him
such
things
do
happen
and
if
he
should
feel
inclined
to
confess
then
you
would
be
lost
henriette
i
know
it
and
it
is
this
constant
dread
which
has
made
me
rush
from
one
dissipation
to
another
so
that
i
should
never
have
time
to
wake
up
to
full
consciousness
maurice
and
now
you
want
me
to
take
my
marriage
portion
out
of
your
dread
that
asking
a
little
too
much
henriette
but
when
i
shared
the
shame
of
maurice
the
murderer
maurice
oh
let
come
to
an
end
with
it
henriette
no
the
end
is
not
yet
and
i
not
let
go
my
hold
until
i
have
put
you
where
you
belong
for
you
ca
go
around
thinking
yourself
better
than
i
am
maurice
so
you
want
to
fight
me
then
all
right
as
you
please
henriette
a
fight
on
life
and
death
the
rolling
of
drums
is
heard
in
the
distance
maurice
the
garden
is
to
be
closed
cursed
is
the
ground
for
thy
sake
thorns
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
thee
henriette
and
the
lord
god
said
unto
the
woman
a
guard
in
uniform
speaking
very
politely
sorry
but
the
garden
has
to
be
closed
curtain
second
scene
the
cremerie
mme
catherine
is
sitting
at
the
counter
making
entries
into
an
account
book
adolphe
and
henriette
are
seated
at
a
table
adolphe
calmly
and
kindly
but
if
i
give
you
my
final
assurance
that
i
did
run
away
but
that
on
the
contrary
i
thought
you
had
played
me
false
this
ought
to
convince
you
henriette
but
why
did
you
fool
us
by
saying
that
those
fellows
were
not
policemen
adolphe
i
did
think
myself
that
they
were
and
then
i
wanted
to
reassure
you
henriette
when
you
say
it
i
believe
you
but
then
you
must
also
believe
me
if
i
reveal
my
innermost
thoughts
to
you
adolphe
go
on
henriette
but
you
must
come
back
with
your
usual
talk
of
fancies
and
delusions
adolphe
you
seem
to
have
reason
to
fear
that
i
may
henriette
i
fear
nothing
but
i
know
you
and
your
scepticism
well
and
then
you
must
tell
this
to
anybody
promise
me
adolphe
i
promise
henriette
now
think
of
it
although
i
must
say
it
something
terrible
i
have
partial
evidence
that
maurice
is
guilty
or
at
least
i
have
reasonable
suspicions
adolphe
you
do
mean
it
henriette
listen
and
judge
for
yourself
when
maurice
left
me
in
the
bois
he
said
he
was
going
to
see
marion
alone
as
the
mother
was
out
and
now
i
have
discovered
afterward
that
he
did
meet
the
mother
so
that
he
has
been
lying
to
me
adolphe
that
possible
and
his
motive
for
doing
so
may
have
been
the
best
but
how
can
anybody
conclude
from
it
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
murder
henriette
ca
you
see
that
do
you
understand
adolphe
not
at
all
henriette
because
you
do
want
to
then
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
report
him
and
we
see
whether
he
can
prove
an
alibi
adolphe
henriette
let
me
tell
you
the
grim
truth
you
like
he
have
reached
the
border
line
of
insanity
the
demons
of
distrust
have
got
hold
of
you
and
each
of
you
is
using
his
own
sense
of
partial
guilt
to
wound
the
other
with
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
a
straight
guess
he
has
also
come
to
suspect
you
of
killing
his
child
henriette
yes
he
mad
enough
to
do
so
adolphe
you
call
his
suspicions
mad
but
not
your
own
henriette
you
have
first
to
prove
the
contrary
or
that
i
suspect
him
unjustly
adolphe
yes
that
easy
a
new
autopsy
has
proved
that
marion
died
of
a
disease
the
queer
name
of
which
i
can
not
recall
just
now
henriette
is
it
true
adolphe
the
official
report
is
printed
in
today
paper
henriette
i
do
take
any
stock
in
it
they
can
make
up
that
kind
of
thing
adolphe
beware
henriette
or
you
may
without
knowing
it
pass
across
that
border
line
beware
especially
of
throwing
out
accusations
that
may
put
you
into
prison
beware
he
places
his
hand
on
her
head
you
hate
maurice
henriette
beyond
all
bounds
adolphe
when
love
turns
into
hatred
it
means
that
it
was
tainted
from
the
start
henriette
in
a
quieter
mood
what
am
i
to
do
tell
me
you
who
are
the
only
one
that
understands
me
adolphe
but
you
do
want
any
sermons
henriette
have
you
nothing
else
to
offer
me
adolphe
nothing
else
but
they
have
helped
me
henriette
preach
away
then
adolphe
try
to
turn
your
hatred
against
yourself
put
the
knife
to
the
evil
spot
in
yourself
for
it
is
there
that
your
trouble
roots
henriette
explain
yourself
adolphe
part
from
maurice
first
of
all
so
that
you
can
not
nurse
your
qualms
of
conscience
together
break
off
your
career
as
an
artist
for
the
only
thing
that
led
you
into
it
was
a
craving
for
freedom
and
fun
as
they
call
it
and
you
have
seen
now
how
much
fun
there
is
in
it
then
go
home
to
your
mother
henriette
never
adolphe
some
other
place
then
henriette
i
suppose
you
know
adolphe
that
i
have
guessed
your
secret
and
why
you
would
accept
the
prize
adolphe
oh
i
assumed
that
you
would
understand
a
story
henriette
well
what
did
you
do
to
get
peace
adolphe
what
i
have
suggested
i
became
conscious
of
my
guilt
repented
decided
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
arranged
my
life
like
that
of
a
penitent
henriette
how
can
you
repent
when
like
me
you
have
no
conscience
is
repentance
an
act
of
grace
bestowed
on
you
as
faith
is
adolphe
everything
is
a
grace
but
it
is
granted
unless
you
seek
it
seek
henriette
remains
silent
adolphe
but
do
wait
beyond
the
allotted
time
or
you
may
harden
yourself
until
you
tumble
down
into
the
irretrievable
henriette
after
a
pause
is
conscience
fear
of
punishment
adolphe
no
it
is
the
horror
inspired
in
our
better
selves
by
the
misdeeds
of
our
lower
selves
henriette
then
i
must
have
a
conscience
also
adolphe
of
course
you
have
but
henriette
tell
me
adolphe
are
you
what
they
call
religious
adolphe
not
the
least
bit
henriette
it
all
so
queer
what
is
religion
adolphe
frankly
speaking
i
do
know
and
i
do
think
anybody
else
can
tell
you
sometimes
it
appears
to
me
like
a
punishment
for
nobody
becomes
religious
without
having
a
bad
conscience
henriette
yes
it
is
a
punishment
now
i
know
what
to
do
adolphe
adolphe
you
go
away
from
here
henriette
yes
i
am
going
to
where
you
said
my
friend
madame
catherine
mme
catherine
have
you
to
go
in
such
a
hurry
henriette
yes
adolphe
do
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
henriette
no
it
would
do
i
am
going
alone
alone
as
i
came
here
one
day
in
spring
thinking
that
i
belonged
where
i
do
belong
and
believing
there
was
something
called
freedom
which
does
not
exist
goes
out
mme
catherine
i
hope
that
lady
never
comes
back
and
i
wish
she
had
never
come
here
at
all
adolphe
who
knows
but
that
she
may
have
had
some
mission
to
fill
here
and
at
any
rate
she
deserves
pity
endless
pity
mme
catherine
i
do
deny
it
for
all
of
us
deserve
that
adolphe
and
she
has
even
done
less
wrong
than
the
rest
of
us
mme
catherine
that
possible
but
not
probable
adolphe
you
are
always
so
severe
madame
catherine
tell
me
have
you
never
done
anything
wrong
mme
catherine
startled
of
course
as
i
am
a
sinful
human
creature
but
if
you
have
been
on
thin
ice
and
fallen
in
you
have
a
right
to
tell
others
to
keep
away
and
you
may
do
so
without
being
held
severe
or
uncharitable
did
i
say
to
monsieur
maurice
the
moment
that
lady
entered
here
look
out
keep
away
and
he
did
and
so
he
fell
in
just
like
a
naughty
child
and
when
a
man
acts
like
that
he
has
to
have
a
spanking
like
any
disobedient
youngster
adolphe
well
has
he
had
his
spanking
mme
catherine
yes
but
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
enough
as
he
is
still
going
around
complaining
adolphe
that
a
very
popular
interpretation
of
the
whole
intricate
question
mme
catherine
oh
pish
you
do
nothing
but
philosophise
about
your
vices
and
while
you
are
still
at
it
the
police
come
along
and
solve
the
riddle
now
please
leave
me
alone
with
my
accounts
adolphe
there
maurice
now
mme
catherine
yes
god
bless
him
maurice
enters
his
face
very
flushed
and
takes
a
seat
near
adolphe
good
evening
mme
catherine
nods
and
goes
on
figuring
adolphe
well
how
everything
with
you
maurice
oh
beginning
to
clear
up
adolphe
hands
him
a
newspaper
which
maurice
does
not
take
so
you
have
read
the
paper
maurice
no
i
do
read
the
papers
any
longer
there
nothing
but
infamies
in
them
adolphe
but
you
had
better
read
it
first
maurice
no
i
wo
it
nothing
but
lies
but
listen
i
have
found
a
new
clue
can
you
guess
who
committed
that
murder
adolphe
nobody
nobody
maurice
do
you
know
where
henriette
was
during
that
quarter
hour
when
the
child
was
left
alone
she
was
there
and
it
is
she
who
has
done
it
adolphe
you
are
crazy
man
maurice
not
i
but
henriette
is
crazy
she
suspects
me
and
has
threatened
to
report
me
adolphe
henriette
was
here
a
while
ago
and
she
used
the
words
as
you
both
of
you
are
crazy
for
it
has
been
proved
by
a
second
autopsy
that
the
child
died
from
a
disease
the
name
of
which
i
have
forgotten
maurice
it
is
true
adolphe
that
what
she
said
also
but
the
official
report
is
printed
in
the
paper
maurice
a
report
then
they
have
made
it
up
adolphe
and
that
also
what
she
said
the
two
of
you
are
suffering
from
the
same
mental
trouble
but
with
her
i
got
far
enough
to
make
her
realise
her
own
condition
maurice
where
did
she
go
adolphe
she
went
far
away
from
here
to
begin
a
new
life
maurice
hm
hm
did
you
go
to
the
funeral
adolphe
i
did
maurice
well
adolphe
well
jeanne
seemed
resigned
and
did
have
a
hard
word
to
say
about
you
maurice
she
is
a
good
woman
adolphe
why
did
you
desert
her
then
maurice
because
i
was
crazy
blown
up
with
pride
especially
and
then
we
had
been
drinking
champagne
adolphe
can
you
understand
now
why
jeanne
wept
when
you
drank
champagne
maurice
yes
i
understand
now
and
for
that
reason
i
have
already
written
to
her
and
asked
her
to
forgive
me
do
you
think
she
will
forgive
me
adolphe
i
think
so
for
it
not
like
her
to
hate
anybody
maurice
do
you
think
she
will
forgive
me
completely
so
that
she
will
come
back
to
me
adolphe
well
i
do
know
about
that
you
have
shown
yourself
so
poor
in
keeping
faith
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
she
will
trust
her
fate
to
you
any
longer
maurice
but
i
can
feel
that
her
fondness
for
me
has
not
ceased
and
i
know
she
will
come
back
to
me
adolphe
how
can
you
know
that
how
can
you
believe
it
did
you
even
suspect
her
and
that
decent
brother
of
hers
of
having
sent
the
police
after
henriette
out
of
revenge
maurice
but
i
do
believe
it
any
longer
that
is
to
say
i
guess
that
fellow
emile
is
a
pretty
slick
customer
mme
catherine
now
look
here
what
are
you
saying
of
monsieur
emile
of
course
he
is
nothing
but
a
workman
but
if
everybody
kept
as
straight
as
he
there
is
no
flaw
in
him
but
a
lot
of
sense
and
tact
emile
enters
monsieur
gerard
maurice
that
me
emile
pardon
me
but
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
in
private
maurice
go
right
on
we
are
all
friends
here
the
abbe
enters
and
sits
down
emile
with
a
glance
at
the
abbe
perhaps
after
maurice
never
mind
the
abbe
is
also
a
friend
although
he
and
i
differ
emile
you
know
who
i
am
monsieur
gerard
my
sister
has
asked
me
to
give
you
this
package
as
an
answer
to
your
letter
maurice
takes
the
package
and
opens
it
emile
and
now
i
have
only
to
add
seeing
as
i
am
in
a
way
my
guardian
that
on
her
behalf
as
well
as
my
own
i
acknowledge
you
free
of
all
obligations
now
when
the
natural
tie
between
you
does
not
exist
any
longer
maurice
but
you
must
have
a
grudge
against
me
emile
must
i
i
ca
see
why
on
the
other
hand
i
should
like
to
have
a
declaration
from
you
here
in
the
presence
of
your
friends
that
you
do
think
either
me
or
my
sister
capable
of
such
a
meanness
as
to
send
the
police
after
mademoiselle
henriette
maurice
i
wish
to
take
back
what
i
said
and
i
offer
you
my
apology
if
you
will
accept
it
emile
it
is
accepted
and
i
wish
all
of
you
a
good
evening
goes
out
everybody
good
evening
maurice
the
tie
and
the
gloves
which
jeanne
gave
me
for
the
opening
night
of
my
play
and
which
i
let
henrietta
throw
into
the
fireplace
who
can
have
picked
them
up
everything
is
dug
up
everything
comes
back
and
when
she
gave
them
to
me
in
the
cemetery
she
said
she
wanted
me
to

human
beings

good
heart
scorned
a
sacrifice
offered

my
own
welfare

was
what
i
threw
away
in
order
to
get
a
laurel
that
is
lying
on
the
rubbish
heap

madame

mme
catherine
oh
i
can
not
i
just
ca
keep
serious
any

she
breaks
into
open
laughter
which
she

smother
with
her
handkerchief
adolphe
say
maurice
the
play
begins
at
eight
abbe
but
the
church
services
are

adolphe
maurice
mme

let

monsieur

maurice
drops
his
head
on
the
table
in
his
arms
adolphe
loose
him
abbe
abbe
no
it
is
not
for
me
to
loose
or
bind
he
must
do
that
himself
maurice
rising
well
i
go
with
the
abbe
abbe
no
my
young
friend
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
but
a
scolding
which
you
can
give
yourself
and
you
owe
a
duty
to
yourself
and
to
your
good
name
that
you
have
got
through
with
this
as
quickly
as
you
have
is
to
me
a
sign
that
you
have
suffered
your
punishment
as
intensely
as
if
it
had
lasted
an
eternity
and
when
providence
absolves
you
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
add
maurice
but
why
did
the
punishment
have
to
be
so
hard
when
i
was
innocent
abbe
hard
only
two
days
and
you
were
not
innocent
for
we
have
to
stand
responsible
for
our
thoughts
and
words
and
desires
also
and
in
your
thought
you
became
a
murderer
when
your
evil
self
wished
the
life
out
of
your
child
maurice
you
are
right
but
my
decision
is
made
i
will
meet
you
at
the
church
in
order
to
have
a
reckoning
with
myself
but
evening
i
go
to
the
theatre
mme
catherine
a
good
solution
monsieur
maurice
adolphe
yes
that
is
the
solution
whew
abbe
yes
so
it
is
curtain
