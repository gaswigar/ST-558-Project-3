illustration
this
is
a
frontways
view
of
bunyip
bluegum
and
his
uncle
wattleberry
at
a
glance
you
can
see
what
a
fine
round
splendid
fellow
bunyip
bluegum
is
without
me
telling
you
at
a
second
glance
you
can
see
that
the
uncle
is
more
square
than
round
and
that
his
face
has
whiskers
on
it
illustration
looked
at
sideways
you
can
still
see
what
a
splendid
fellow
bunyip
is
though
you
can
only
see
one
of
his
uncle
whiskers
illustration
observed
from
behind
however
you
completely
lose
sight
of
the
whiskers
and
so
fail
to
realize
how
immensely
important
they
are
in
fact
these
very
whiskers
were
the
chief
cause
of
bunyip
leaving
home
to
see
the
world
for
as
he
often
said
to
himself
alone
are
bad
enough
attached
to
faces
coarse
and
rough
but
how
much
greater
their
offence
is
when
stuck
on
uncles
countenances
illustration
the
plain
truth
was
that
bunyip
and
his
uncle
lived
in
a
small
house
in
a
tree
and
there
was
no
room
for
the
whiskers
what
was
worse
the
whiskers
were
red
and
they
blew
about
in
the
wind
and
uncle
wattleberry
would
insist
on
bringing
them
to
the
dinner
table
with
him
where
they
got
in
the
soup
bunyip
bluegum
was
a
tidy
bear
and
he
objected
to
whisker
soup
so
he
was
forced
to
eat
his
meals
outside
which
was
awkward
and
besides
lizards
came
and
borrowed
his
soup
illustration
illustration
his
uncle
refused
to
listen
to
reason
on
the
subject
of
his
whiskers
it
was
quite
useless
giving
him
hints
such
as
presents
of
razors
and
scissors
and
boxes
of
matches
to
burn
them
off
on
such
occasions
he
would
remark
may
add
an
air
that
somewhat
brisker
for
dignity
commend
me
to
the
whisker
or
when
more
deeply
moved
he
would
exclaim
noble
thoughts
the
inward
being
grace
so
noble
whiskers
dignify
the
face
prayers
and
entreaties
to
remove
the
whiskers
being
of
no
avail
bunyip
decided
to
leave
home
without
more
ado
the
trouble
was
that
he
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
be
a
traveller
or
a
swagman
you
ca
go
about
the
world
being
nothing
but
if
you
are
a
traveller
you
have
to
carry
a
bag
while
if
you
are
a
swagman
you
have
to
carry
a
swag
and
the
question
is
which
is
the
heavier
illustration
at
length
he
decided
to
put
the
matter
before
egbert
rumpus
bumpus
the
poet
and
ask
his
advice
he
found
egbert
busy
writing
poems
on
a
slate
he
was
so
busy
that
he
only
had
time
to
sing
out
interrupt
the
poet
friend
until
his
poem
at
an
end
and
went
on
writing
harder
than
ever
he
wrote
all
down
one
side
of
the
slate
and
all
up
the
other
and
then
remarked
there
no
time
to
finish
that
the
time
has
come
to
have
our
chat
be
quick
my
friend
your
business
state
before
i
take
another
slate
illustration
fact
is
said
the
bunyip
have
decided
to
see
the
world
and
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
whether
to
be
a
traveller
or
a
swagman
which
would
you
advise
then
said
the
poet
you
no
bags
it
plain
to
see
a
traveller
you
can
not
be
and
as
a
swag
you
have
either
you
can
not
be
a
swagman
neither
for
travellers
must
carry
bags
and
swagmen
have
to
hump
their
swags
like
or
ragmen
as
you
have
neither
swag
nor
bag
you
must
remain
a
simple
wag
and
not
a
or
bagman
illustration
me
said
bunyip
bluegum
never
thought
of
that
what
must
i
do
in
order
to
see
the
world
without
carrying
swags
or
bags
the
poet
thought
deeply
put
on
his
eyeglass
and
said
impressively
my
advice
do
carry
bags
for
bags
are
just
as
bad
as
swags
they
never
made
to
measure
to
see
the
world
your
simple
trick
is
but
to
take
a
assume
an
air
of
pleasure
and
tell
the
people
near
and
far
you
stroll
about
because
you
are
a
gentleman
of
leisure
illustration
have
solved
the
problem
said
bunyip
bluegum
and
wringing
his
friend
hand
he
ran
straight
home
took
his
uncle
and
assuming
an
air
of
pleasure
set
off
to
see
the
world
he
found
a
great
many
things
to
see
such
as
dandelions
and
ants
and
traction
engines
and
bolting
horses
and
furniture
being
removed
besides
being
kept
busy
raising
his
hat
and
passing
the
time
of
day
with
people
on
the
road
for
he
was
a
very
young
fellow
polite
in
his
manners
graceful
in
his
attitudes
and
able
to
converse
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
having
read
all
the
best
australian
poets
unfortunately
in
the
hurry
of
leaving
home
he
had
forgotten
to
provide
himself
with
food
and
at
lunch
time
found
himself
attacked
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
me
he
said
feel
quite
faint
i
had
no
idea
that
stomach
was
so
important
i
have
everything
i
require
except
food
but
without
food
everything
is
rather
less
than
nothing
got
a
stick
to
walk
with
i
got
a
mind
to
think
with
i
got
a
voice
to
talk
with
i
got
an
eye
to
wink
with
i
lots
of
teeth
to
eat
with
a
brand
new
hat
to
bow
with
a
pair
of
fists
to
beat
with
a
rage
to
have
a
row
with
no
joy
it
brings
to
have
indeed
a
lot
of
things
one
does
not
need
observe
my
doleful
plight
for
here
am
i
without
a
crumb
to
satisfy
a
raging
tum
o
what
an
oversight
as
he
was
indulging
in
these
melancholy
reflexions
he
came
round
a
bend
in
the
road
and
discovered
two
people
in
the
very
act
of
having
lunch
these
people
were
none
other
than
bill
barnacle
the
sailor
and
his
friend
sam
sawnoff
the
penguin
bold
bill
was
a
small
man
with
a
large
hat
a
beard
half
as
large
as
his
hat
and
feet
half
as
large
as
his
beard
sam
sawnoff
feet
were
sitting
down
and
his
body
was
standing
up
because
his
feet
were
so
short
and
his
body
so
long
that
he
had
to
do
both
together
they
had
a
pudding
in
a
basin
and
the
smell
that
arose
from
it
was
so
delightful
that
bunyip
bluegum
was
quite
unable
to
pass
on
illustration
me
he
said
raising
his
hat
am
i
right
in
supposing
that
this
is
a
pudding
present
it
is
said
bill
barnacle
smells
delightful
said
bunyip
bluegum
is
delightful
said
bill
eating
a
large
mouthful
bunyip
bluegum
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
invite
himself
to
lunch
but
he
said
carelessly
i
right
in
supposing
that
there
are
onions
in
this
pudding
before
bill
could
reply
a
thick
angry
voice
came
out
of
the
pudding
saying
bunions
corns
and
crabs
whiskers
wheels
and
hansom
cabs
beef
and
bottles
beer
and
bones
give
him
a
feed
and
end
his
groans
albert
said
bill
to
the
puddin
your
manners
yours
said
the
puddin
rudely
away
there
and
never
so
much
as
offering
this
stranger
a
slice
you
are
said
bill
nothing
this
puddin
enjoys
more
than
offering
slices
of
himself
to
strangers
very
polite
of
him
said
bunyip
but
the
puddin
replied
loudly
be
sugared
politeness
be
hanged
politeness
be
jumbled
and
tumbled
and
banged
it
simply
a
matter
of
putting
on
pace
politeness
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
illustration
anxious
to
be
eaten
said
bill
this
puddin
mania
well
to
oblige
him
i
ask
you
to
join
us
at
lunch
i
sure
said
bunyip
seating
himself
nothing
i
enjoy
more
than
a
good
go
in
at
pudding
in
the
open
air
said
remarked
sam
sawnoff
patting
him
on
the
back
eaters
are
always
welcome
enjoy
this
puddin
said
bill
handing
him
a
large
slice
is
a
very
rare
puddin
a
puddin
said
sam
a
christmas
steak
and
puddin
said
bill
a
shall
i
tell
him
he
asked
looking
at
bill
bill
nodded
and
the
penguin
leaned
across
to
bunyip
bluegum
and
said
in
a
low
voice
a
magic
puddin
whispering
shouted
the
puddin
angrily
up
do
strain
a
puddin
ears
at
the
meal
table
harm
intended
albert
said
sam
was
merely
remarking
how
well
the
crops
are
looking
call
him
albert
when
addressing
him
he
added
to
bunyip
bluegum
soothes
him
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
albert
said
bunyip
soft
soap
from
total
strangers
said
the
puddin
rudely
take
no
notice
of
him
mate
said
bill
only
his
rough
and
ready
way
what
this
puddin
requires
is
politeness
and
constant
eatin
they
had
a
delightful
meal
eating
as
much
as
possible
for
whenever
they
stopped
eating
the
puddin
sang
out
away
chew
away
munch
and
bolt
and
guzzle
never
leave
the
table
till
you
full
up
to
the
muzzle
illustration
but
at
length
they
had
to
stop
in
spite
of
these
encouraging
remarks
and
as
they
refused
to
eat
any
more
the
puddin
got
out
of
his
basin
remarking
you
wo
eat
any
more
here
giving
you
a
run
for
the
sake
of
exercise
and
he
set
off
so
swiftly
on
a
pair
of
extremely
thin
legs
that
bill
had
to
run
like
an
antelope
to
catch
him
up
word
said
bill
when
the
puddin
was
brought
back
have
to
be
as
smart
as
paint
to
keep
this
puddin
in
order
he
that
artful
lawyers
could
manage
him
put
your
hat
on
albert
like
a
little
gentleman
he
added
placing
the
basin
on
his
head
he
took
the
puddin
hand
sam
took
the
other
and
they
all
set
off
along
the
road
a
peculiar
thing
about
the
puddin
was
that
though
they
had
all
had
a
great
many
slices
off
him
there
was
no
sign
of
the
place
whence
the
slices
had
been
cut
where
the
magic
comes
in
explained
bill
more
you
eats
the
more
you
gets
is
his
name
an
cut
an
come
again
is
his
nature
me
an
sam
has
been
eatin
away
at
this
for
years
and
there
not
a
mark
on
him
perhaps
he
added
would
like
to
hear
how
we
came
to
own
this
remarkable
puddin
would
please
me
more
said
bunyip
bluegum
that
case
said
bill
her
go
for
a
song
illustration
the
cook
of
the
was
a
feller
called
curry
and
rice
a
son
of
a
gun
as
fat
as
a
tun
with
a
face
as
round
as
a
bun
or
a
barrel
to
be
precise
winter
morn
we
rounds
the
horn
homeward
bound
we
strikes
on
the
ice
goes
down
in
a
trice
and
all
on
board
but
curry
and
rice
and
me
an
sam
is
drowned
illustration
sam
an
me
an
the
cook
yer
see
we
climbs
on
a
lump
of
ice
and
there
in
the
sleet
we
suffered
a
treat
for
several
months
from
frozen
feet
with
nothin
at
all
but
ice
to
eat
and
ice
does
not
suffice
sam
and
me
we
could
agree
with
the
cook
at
any
price
we
was
both
as
thin
as
a
piece
of
tin
while
that
there
cook
was
busting
his
skin
on
nothin
to
eat
but
ice
illustration
sam
to
me
it
a
mystery
more
deep
than
words
can
utter
whatever
we
do
here
me
an
you
us
both
as
thin
as
irish
stoo
while
he
as
fat
as
butter
late
one
night
we
wakes
in
fright
to
see
by
a
pale
blue
flare
that
cook
has
got
in
a
phantom
pot
a
big
an
a
hot
and
the
guzzlin
wizard
is
eatin
the
lot
on
top
of
the
iceberg
bare
a
verse
left
out
here
said
bill
stopping
the
song
to
the
difficulty
of
explainin
exactly
what
happened
when
me
and
sam
discovered
the
deceitful
nature
of
that
cook
the
next
verse
is
as
follows
sam
an
me
can
never
agree
what
happened
to
curry
and
rice
the
whole
affair
is
shrouded
in
doubt
for
the
night
was
dark
and
the
flare
went
out
and
all
we
heard
was
a
startled
shout
though
i
think
meself
in
the
subsequent
rout
that
us
bein
thin
an
him
bein
stout
in
the
middle
of
pushin
an
shovin
about
he
must
have
fell
off
the
ice
wo
do
you
know
began
the
puddin
but
sam
said
hurriedly
was
very
dark
and
there
no
sayin
at
this
date
what
happened
there
is
said
the
puddin
i
had
my
eye
on
the
whole
affair
and
it
my
belief
that
if
he
had
been
so
round
you
have
never
rolled
him
off
the
iceberg
for
you
was
both
singin
out
yo
heave
ho
for
half
an
hour
an
him
trying
to
hold
on
to
bill
beard
illustration
the
haste
of
the
moment
said
bill
may
have
got
a
bit
of
a
shove
for
the
ice
bein
slippy
and
us
bein
justly
enraged
and
him
bein
as
round
as
a
barrel
he
may
as
i
said
have
been
too
fat
to
save
himself
from
rollin
off
the
iceberg
the
point
however
is
immaterial
to
our
story
which
concerns
this
puddin
and
this
puddin
said
bill
patting
him
on
the
basin
the
very
puddin
that
curry
and
rice
invented
on
the
iceberg
must
have
been
a
very
clever
cook
said
bunyip
was
poor
feller
he
was
said
bill
greatly
affected
plum
duff
or
irish
stoo
there
was
his
equal
in
the
land
but
enough
of
these
sad
subjects
pausin
only
to
explain
that
me
an
sam
got
off
the
iceberg
on
a
homeward
bound
chicken
coop
landed
on
tierra
del
fuego
walked
to
valparaiso
and
so
got
home
i
will
proceed
to
enliven
the
occasion
with
the
ballad
of
the
bride
and
without
more
ado
bill
who
had
one
of
those
voices
roared
out
aboard
the
junk
we
was
rollin
homeward
bound
when
the
bride
fell
over
the
side
and
very
near
got
drowned
rollin
home
rollin
home
rollin
home
across
the
foam
she
had
to
swim
to
save
her
glim
and
catch
us
rollin
home
it
was
a
very
long
song
so
the
rest
of
it
is
left
out
here
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
rolling
and
roaring
in
it
and
they
all
joined
in
the
chorus
they
were
all
singing
away
at
the
top
of
their
pipe
as
bill
called
it
when
round
a
bend
in
the
road
they
came
on
two
persons
hiding
behind
a
tree
one
was
a
possum
with
one
of
those
sharp
snooting
snouting
sort
of
faces
and
the
other
was
a
bulbous
wombat
in
an
old
coat
and
a
hat
that
marked
him
down
as
a
man
you
could
trust
in
the
fowlyard
they
were
busy
sharpening
up
a
carving
knife
on
a
portable
but
the
moment
they
caught
sight
of
the
travellers
the
possum
whipped
the
knife
behind
him
and
the
wombat
put
his
hat
over
the
grindstone
bill
barnacle
flew
into
a
passion
at
these
signs
of
treachery
see
you
there
he
shouted
ca
see
all
of
us
shouted
the
possum
and
the
wombat
added
why
some
of
us
is
behind
the
tree
illustration
bill
led
the
others
aside
in
order
to
hold
a
consultation
on
earth
to
be
done
he
said
shall
have
to
fight
them
as
usual
said
sam
do
you
have
to
fight
them
asked
bunyip
bluegum
they
after
our
puddin
said
bill
after
our
puddin
explained
sam
professional
as
we
perfessional
said
bill
have
to
fight
them
on
principle
the
fighting
he
added
a
mere
as
the
sayin
goes
the
trouble
is
what
to
be
done
with
the
puddin
you
do
the
fighting
said
bunyip
bravely
shall
mind
the
puddin

bill

very
secret

a
brutal
suggestion
said
the
puddin
but
no
notice
was
taken
of
his
objections
and
as
soon
as
he
was
turned
safely
bill
and
sam
ran
straight
at
the
and
commenced
sparring
up
at
them
with
the
greatest
activity
up
ye
shouted
bill
keep
us
sparrin
up
here
all
day
come
out
an
take
your
gruel
while
you
got
the
chance
the
possum
wished
to
turn
the
matter
off
by
saying
see
the
price
of
eggs
has
gone
up
again
but
bill
gave
him
a
punch
on
the
snout
that
bent
it
like
a
carrot
and
sam
caught
the
wombat
such
a
flip
with
his
flapper
that
he
gave
in
at
once
sha
be
able
to
fight
any
more
this
afternoon
said
the
wombat
i
got
sore
feet
the
possum
said
hurriedly
shall
be
late
for
that
appointment
and
they
took
their
grindstone
and
off
they
went
illustration
but
when
they
were
a
safe
distance
away
the
possum
sang
out
repent
this
conduct
you
repent
bending
a
man
snout
so
that
he
can
hardly
see
over
it
let
alone
breathe
through
it
with
comfort
and
the
wombat
added
shame
flapping
a
man
with
sore
feet
laugh
with
scorn
at
threats
said
bill
and
he
added
as
a
warning
do
repent
a
snout
that
bent
and
if
again
i
tap
it
oh
with
a
clout
i
bend
that
snout
with
force
enough
to
snap
it
and
sam
added
for
the
wombat
benefit
take
no
shame
to
fight
the
lame
when
they
deserve
to
cop
it

not

disappeared
over

as
the
evening
happened
to
come
down
rather
suddenly
at
that
moment
bill
said
bein
over
for
the
day
now
the
time
to
set
about
makin
the
camp
fire
this
was
a
welcome
suggestion
for
as
all
travellers
know
if
you
sit
by
a
camp
fire
in
the
evening
you
have
to
sit
by
nothing
in
the
dark
which
is
a
most
unsociable
way
of
spending
your
time
they
found
a
comfortable
nook
under
the
hedge
where
there
were
plenty
of
dry
leaves
to
rest
on
and
there
they
built
a
fire
and
put
the
billy
on
and
made
tea
the
tea
and
sugar
and
three
tin
cups
and
half
a
pound
of
mixed
biscuits
were
brought
out
of
the
bag
by
sam
while
bill
cut
slices
of
from
the
puddin
after
that
they
had
boiled
and
as
the
fancy
took
them
for
if
you
wanted
a
change
of
food
from
the
puddin
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
whistle
twice
and
turn
the
basin
round
after
they
had
eaten
as
much
as
they
wanted
the
things
were
put
away
in
the
bag
and
they
settled
down
comfortably
for
the
evening

this
song
see

how

would
prove
that

never

a
notion
how
penguins
brave

laugh
with
scorn

see
the
penguin
at
his
ease
performing
fearful
larks
with
stingarees
of
all
degrees
as
well
as

sight
would
quickly
let

the
great
contempt
that
penguins
show
for
stingarees
and
sharks

see
the
penguin
as
he
goes

supreme
contempt
for
foolish
seals

he
never
fails
he
goes

turn
on

all
very
fine
said
the
puddin
gloomily
about
the
joys
of
being
penguins

pirates
but
how
you
like
to
be

all

in

voice
he
sang
as

you
a

in

we
shall
have
a
slice
of
you

up

when
that
was
done

up

having
given
three
rousing
cheers

turned
in

up

early
next

and
had
the

on

tea
made

which
is

anythin

shinin
why
it
singin
a
song
at

of
day
on
puddin
for
breakfast
dinin
illustration
there
was
a
hearty
round
of
applause
at
this
song
for
as
bunyip
bluegum
remarked
at
breakfast
should
certainly
be
more
commonly
indulged
in
as
it
greatly
tends
to
enliven
what
is
on
most
occasions
a
somewhat
dull
proceeding
of
the
great
advantages
of
being
a
professional
said
sam
sawnoff
that
songs
at
breakfast
are
always
encouraged
none
of
the
ordinary
breakfast
rules
such
as
scowling
while
eating
and
saying
the
porridge
is
as
stiff
as
glue
and
the
eggs
are
as
tough
as
leather
are
observed
instead
songs
roars
of
laughter
and
boisterous
jests
are
the
order
of
the
day
for
example
this
sort
of
thing
added
sam
doing
a
rapid
and
landing
with
a
thump
on
bill
head
as
bill
was
unprepared
for
this
act
of
boisterous
humour
his
face
was
pushed
into
the
puddin
with
great
violence
and
the
gravy
was
splashed
in
his
eye

jeredelum

bill
a
man
face
into
his

breakfast
is
beyond
rules
or
reason
and
deserves
a
punch
in
the
gizzard
seeing
matters
arriving
at
this
unpromising
situation
bunyip
bluegum
interposed
by
saying
than
allow
this
happy
occasion
to
be
marred
by
unseemly
recriminations
let
us
while
admitting
that
our
admirable
friend
sam
may
have
unwittingly
disturbed
the
composure
of
our
admirable
friend
bill
at
the
expense
of
our
admirable
gravy
let
us
i
say
by
the
simple
act
of
extending
the
hand
of
friendship
dispel
in
an
instant
these
gathering
clouds
of
disruption
in
the
words
of
the
poem
let
the
fist
of
friendship
be
kept
for
friendship
foes
let
that
hand
in

land
on

nose
these
fine
sentiments
at
once
dispelled
bill
anger
he
shook
hands
warmly
with
sam
wiped
the
gravy
from
his
face
and
resumed
breakfast
with
every
appearance
of
hearty
good
humour
the
meal
over
the
breakfast
things
were
put
away
in
the
bag
sam
and
bill
took
puddin
between
them
and
all
set
off
along
the
road
enlivening
the
way
with
song
and
story
bill
regaled
them
with
portions
of
the
of
the
junk
which
is
one
of
those
songs
that
go
on
for
ever
its
great
advantage
as
bill
remarked
was
that
as
it
had
got
an
ending
it
did
need
a
beginning
so
you
could
start
it
anywhere
for
instance
said
bill
and
he
roared
out
aboard
the
junk
rollin
home
across
the
line
the
collared
the
captain
hat
and
threw
it
in

entertaining
themselves
in
this
way
as
they
strolled
along
they
were
presently
arrested
by
shouts
of
fire
and
a
fireman
in
a
large
helmet
came
bolting
down
the
road
pulling
a
fire
hose
behind
him
said
bill
we
shall
have
the
spectacle
of
a
fire
to
entertain
us
and
accosting
the
fireman
he
demanded
to
know
where
the
fire
was
fact
is
said
the
fireman
owing
to
the
size
of
this
helmet
i
ca
see
where
it
is
but
if
you
will
kindly
glance
at
the
surrounding
district
you
see
it
about
somewhere
they
glanced
about
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
fire
burning
in
the
next
field
it
was
only
a
cowshed
certainly
but
it
was
blazing
very
nicely
and
well
worth
looking
at
said
bill
the
form
of
a
common
cowshed
is
burnin
about
as
the
crow
flies
that
case
said
the
fireman
invite
all
present
bravely
to
assist
in
putting
it
out
but
he
added
impressively
you
take
my
advice
you
shove
that
puddin
in
this
hollow
log
and
roll
a
stone
agen
the
end
to
keep
him
in
for
if
he
gets
too
near
the
flames
he
be
cooked
again
and
have
his
flavour
ruined
illustration
is
a
very
sensible
feller
said
bill
and
though
puddin
objected
strongly
he
was
at
once
pushed
into
a
log
and
securely
fastened
in
with
a
large
stone
illustration
you
like
to
be
shoved
in
a
blooming
log
he
shouted
at
bill
you
was
burning
with
anxiety
to
see
the
fire
but
bill
said
severely
sensible
albert
fires
is
too
dangerous
to
flavours
no
more
time
was
lost
in
seizing
the
hose
and
they
set
off
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
for
as
everyone
knows
running
with
the
reel
is
one
of
the
grand
joys
of
being
a
fireman
they
had
the
hose
fixed
to
a
garden
tap
in
no
time
and
soon
were
all
hard
at
work
putting
out
the
fire
illustration
of
course
there
was
a
great
deal
of
smoke
and
shouting
and
getting
tripped
up
by
the
hose
and
it
was
by
the
merest
chance
bunyip
bluegum
glanced
back
in
time
to
see
the
wombat
in
the
act
of
stealing
the
puddin
from
the
hollow
log
is
at
work
he
shouted
roared
bill
and
with
one
blow
on
the
snout
knocked
the
fireman
endways
on
into
the
burning
cinders
where
his
helmet
fell
off
and
exposed
the
countenance
of
that
snooting
snouting
scoundrel
the
possum
the
possum
of
course
had
expected
to
have
his
disguise
pierced
so
swiftly
and
though
he
managed
to
scramble
out
of
the
fire
in
time
to
save
his
bacon
he
was
considerably
singed
down
the
back
a
murderous
attack
he
exclaimed
what
a
brutal
attempt
to
burn
a
man
alive
and
as
some
hot
cinders
had
got
down
his
back
he
gave
a
sharp
yell
and
ran
off
singeing
and
smoking
bill
distracted
with
rage
ran
after
the
possum
then
changed
his
mind
and
ran
after
the
wombat
so
that
what
with
running
first
after
one
and
then
after
the
other
they
both
had
time
to
get
clean
away
and
disappeared
over
the
skyline
see
it
all
shouted
bill
casting
himself

that

follow
the
call

set
off
at

and
after
a

came
to
a
small
house
with
a

on
it
saying

met
a

all
the

he
added
no
use
wastin
time
over
this
and
leaving
the
parrot
to
pursue
his
way
they
hurried
off
in
search
of
information
the
next
person
they
spied
was
a
bandicoot
carrying
a
watermelon
at
a
first
glance
you
would
have
thought
it
was
merely
a
watermelon
walking
by
itself
but
a
second
glance
would
have
shown
you
that
the
walking
was
being
done
by
a
small
pair
of
legs
attached
to
the
watermelon
and
a
third
glance
would
have
disclosed
that
the
legs
were
attached
to
a
bandicoot
they
shouted
you
with
the
melon
to
attract
his
attention
and
set
off
running
after
him
and
the
bandicoot
being
naturally
of
a
terrified
disposition
ran
for
all
he
was
worth
he
was
worth
much
as
a
runner
owing
to
the
weight
of
the
watermelon
and
they
caught
him
up
across
the
field
illustration
conceiving
that
his
hour
had
come
the
bandicoot
gave
a
shrill
squeak
of
terror
and
fell
on

knees

he
gasped

nonsense

terrified
turnip
leaving
the
bandicoot
to
pursue
his
quavering
existence
they
set
off
again
bill
giving
way
to
some
very
despondent
expressions
far
as
i
can
see
he
said
we
ca
find
somethin
better
than
hedgehogs
peevish
parrots
and
funkin
bandicoots
we
may
as
well
give
way
to

bunyip

was
forced
to
exert
his
finest
oratory
to
inspire
them
to
another
frame
of

exclaimed

unconquerable

exclaimed
bill
grasping
bunyip
bluegum
by
the
hand
and
they
proceeded
with
expressions
of
the
greatest
courage
and
determination
as
a
reward
for
this
renewed
activity
they
got
some
useful
information
from
a
rooster
who
was
standing
at
his
front
gate
looking
up
and
down
the
road
and
wishing
to
heaven
that
somebody
would
come
along
for
him
to
talk
to
they
got
in
fact
a
good
deal
more
information
than
they
asked
for
for
the
rooster
was
one
of
those
fine
bumptious
skites
who
love
to
talk
all
day
in
the
heartiest
manner
to
total
strangers

possum
he
exclaimed
when
they
had
put
the
usual
question
to
him
what
an
extraordinary
thing
that
you
should
come
along
and
ask
me
that
question
what
an
astounding
and
incredible
thing
that
you
should
actually
use
the
word
singed
in
connexion
with
the
word
possum
though
mind
you
the
word
i
had
in
my
mind
was
not
singed
but
burning
and
not
possum
but
feathers
now
i
tell
you
why
only
this
morning
as
i
was
standing
here
i
said
to
myself

burning
feathers
i
called
out
at
once
to
the

very
moment
that

repeating
the
words

burning
you
come
along
and
repeat
the
words
singed
and
possum
instantly
i
call
to
mind
that
at
the
identical
moment
that
i
smelt
something
burning
i
saw
a
possum
passing
this
very
gate
though
whether
he
happened
to
be
singed
or
not
i
did
inquire
way
did
he
go
inquired
bill
excitedly
let
me
see
said
the
rooster
went
down
the
road

to
the
right

a
jump
and
a
howl

set
off
in

direction

after
shouted
bill
and
bolted
off
down
the
road
followed
by
the
others
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
request
to
wait
a
minute
and
be
introduced
to

followed
the
rooster
directions
with
the
utmost
rapidity
and
came
to
a
large
hollow
tree
with
a
door
in
the
side
and
a
nailed
up
which
said
wombat

residence
the
door
was
locked
but
it
was
clear
that
the
were
inside
because
they
heard
the
possum
say
peevishly
eating
too
much
and
here
me
most
severely
singed
not
getting
sufficient
and
the
wombat
was

to

to
the
word
he
swiftly
made
a

stuck
them
on

said

take

followed
them
for

singing
out
insulting
things

the
bloke

course
treated
this
conduct
with
silent
contempt
it
was
his
rule
through
life
he
said
never
to
fight
people
with
beaks
the
next
encounter
they
had
was
with
a
who
though
not
so
vulgar
and
rude
as
the
kookaburra
was
equally
enraged
because
as
bill
had
suspicions
that
he
was
the
possum
disguised
he
insisted
on
measuring
him
to
see
if
he
was
the

was
measuring
him
a

by

nice
thing
indeed
to
happen
to
finglebury
the
and
respected
fruit
stealer
however
he
was
found
to
be
six
inches
too
short
so
they
let
him
go
and
he
hurried
off
saying
shall
have
the
law
on
you
for
this
measuring
a
man
in
a
public
place

being
licensed

the
third
disturbance
due
to

suspicions
occurred
while
bunyip
bluegum
was
in
a
grocer
shop
they
had
run
out
of
tea
and
sugar
and
happening
to
pass
through
the
town
of
bungledoo
took
the
opportunity
of
laying
in
a
fresh
supply
if
bunyip
had
been
in
the
shop
as
was
pointed
out
afterwards
the
trouble
would
have
occurred
the
first
he
heard
of
it
was
a
scream
of
help
murder
is
being
done
and
rushing
out
of
the
shop
what
was
his
amazement
to
see
no
less
a
person
than
his
uncle
wattleberry
bounding
and
plunging
about
the
road
with
bill
hanging
on
to
his
whiskers
and
sam
hanging
on
to
one
leg

got
him
shouted
bill
a
hold
of
his
other
leg
and
give
me
a
chance
to
get
his
whiskers
off
why
are
you
taking
his
whiskers
off

bunyip

stuck
on
with

it
at

said
bunyip
hurriedly
are
making
a
mistake
this
is
not

this
is
an
uncle
what
exclaimed
bill
letting
go
the
whiskers
uncle
replied
bunyip
bluegum
uncle
roared
uncle
wattleberry
uncle
of
the
highest
integrity
you
have
most
disgracefully
and
unmercifully
pulled
an
uncle
whiskers
can
assure
you
said
bill
pulled
them
under
the
delusion
that
you
was
a
disguised
wombat
is
no
excuse
sir
bellowed
uncle
wattleberry
one
but
an
unmitigated
ruffian
would
pull
an
uncle
whiskers
but
the
basest
scoundrel
would
pluck
an
uncle
whiskers
in
their
pride
what
baseness
then
doth
such
a
man
disclose
who
raise
a
hand
to
pluck
an
uncle
nose
i
gone
too
far
said
bill
apologize
if
i
known
you
was
an
uncle
i
would
have
done
it
are
totally
inadequate
shouted
uncle
wattleberry
short
of
felling
you
to
the
earth
with
an
umbrella
could
possibly
atone
for
the
outrage
you
are
a
danger
to
the
public
you
have
knocked
my
hat
off
pulled
my
whiskers
and
tried
to
remove
my
nose
your
nose
said
bill
solemnly
a
mistake
any
man
might
make
for
i
put
it
to
all
present
as
man
to
man
if
that
nose
look
as
if
it
only
gummed
on
all
present
were
forced
to
admit
that
it
was
a
mistake
that
any
man
might
make
man
as
sam
remarked
think
he
was
doing
you
a
kindness
by
trying
to
pull
it
off
me
to
point
out
also
my
dear
uncle
said
bunyip
bluegum
your
whiskers
were
responsible
for
this
seeming
outrage
let
your
anger
then
be
assuaged
by
the
consciousness
that
you
are
the
victim
not
of
malice
but
of
the
misfortune
of
wearing
whiskers
now
exclaimed
uncle
wattleberry
nephew
bunyip
among
these
sacrilegious
and
my
nephew
not
only
aiding
and
abetting
these
ruffians
but
seeking
to
palliate
their
crimes
this
is
too
much
my
feelings
are
such
that
nothing
but
bounding
and
plunging
can
relieve
them
and
thereupon
did
uncle
wattleberry
proceed
to
bound
and
plunge
with
the
greatest
activity
shouting
all
the
while
need
not
think
i
bound
and
plunge
like
this
in
festive
mood
i
bound
that
bounding
may
expunge
the
thought
of
insult
rude
uncle
rage
must
seek
relief
his
anger
must
be
drowned
it
is
to
soothe
an
uncle
grief
that
thus
i
plunge
and
bound
bound
and
plunge
i
seethe
with
rage
my
mighty
anger
seeks
so
much
relief
that
i
engage
to
plunge
and
bound
for
weeks
seeing
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
inducing
uncle
wattleberry
to
look
at
the
affair
in
a
reasonable
light
they
walked
off
and
left
him
to
continue
his
bounding
and
plunging
for
the
amusement
of
the
people
of
bungledoo
who
brought
their
chairs
out
on
to
the
footpath
in
order
to
enjoy
the
sight
at
their
ease
bill
intention
to
regard
everybody
he
met
with
suspicion
was
somewhat
damped
by
this
mistake
and
he
said
there
ought
to
be
a
law
to
prevent
a
man
going
about
looking
as
if
he
was
a
disguised
the
most
annoying
part
of
it
all
was
that
when
the
did
make
their
appearance
they
were
disguised
at
all
they
were
dressed
as
common
ordinary
save
that
the
possum
carried
a
bran
bag
in
his

the

waved
a

as
from

angels
well
said

at

just

at
it

see
what
it

shook
his

said
glancing
and

added

that
no

all
heads
must

there
is
a

we
may
as
well
have
it
if
there
ai
a

we
shall
simply
have
to
punch
their
snouts
as
usual
must
confess

bunyip

the
prompting
of
a
certain
curiosity
as
to
the
nature

added
there
no

he
held
the

open
invitingly

hesitated
a
moment
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong
and
they
all
looked
in
together
it
was
a
fatal
act
the
possum
whipped
the
bag
over
their
heads
the
wombat
whipped
a
rope
round
the
bag
and
there
they
were
helpless
illustration
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
puddin
being
too
short
to
look
in
was
left
outside
and
the
grabbed
him
at
once
and
ran
off
like
winking
to
add
to
the
discomfiture
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
bran
in
the
bag

as
bill
said
afterwards
there
anything
worse
than
losing
a
valuable
puddin
it
bran
in
the
whiskers
they
bounded
and
plunged
about
but
soon
had
to
stop
that
on

treading

other
toes

almost
as

in

they
sang
in

reproved
this
saying
our
misfortunes
are
due
to
exhibiting
too
great
a
trust
in
scoundrels
so
let
us
bear
them
with
the
greater
fortitude
as
in
innocence
we
fell

let
our
conduct
in

extremity
be
guided
by
the
courageous
endurance
of
men

are
free
from
guilt
illustration

these
fine
words
greatly
stimulated
the
others
and
they
endured
with
fortitude
walking
on
sam
feet
for
an
hour
and
a
half
when
the
sound
of
footsteps
apprised
them
that
a
traveller
was
approaching
this
traveller
was
a
grave
elderly
dog
named
benjimen
brandysnap
who
was
going
to
market
with
eggs
seeing
three
people
walking
in
a
bag
he
naturally
supposed
they
were
practising
for
the
sports
but
on
hearing
their
appeals
for
help
he
very
kindly
undid
the
rope
exclaimed
bill
grasping
him
by
the
hand
being
said
sam
angel
of
oppressed
said
bunyip
bluegum
benjimen
was
quite
overcome
by
these
expressions
of
esteem
and
handed
round
eggs
which
were
eaten
on
the
spot
now
said
bill
again
shaking
hands
with
their
preserver
am
about
to
ask
you
a
most
important
question
have
you
seen
any
about
this
mornin
said
benjimen
me
see
now
that
you
mention
it
i
remember
seeing
two
at
this
morning
but
they
were
stealing
puddin
they
were
engaged
stealing
a
bag
out
of
my
stable
i
was
busy
at
the
time
whistling
to
the
carrots
or
i
have
stopped
them
is
most
important
information
said
bill
proves
this
must
be
the
very
bag
they
stole
in
what
direction
did
the
scoundrels
go
friend
after
stealing
your
bag
i
was
engaged
at
the
moment
feeding
the
parsnips
i
did
happen
to
notice
said
benjimen
at
this
season
generally
go
owing
to
the
price
of
onions
that
case
said
bill
shall
take
a
course
for
my
belief
that
havin
stolen
our
puddin
they
make
back
to
winter
quarters
will
pursue
to
the
with
the

it

hitting
him
hard

off

a

tried
to
escape
punishment

now
that
their
guilt
was
proved

such
a
trouncing

their
shrieks
pierced
the
firmament

this
had
been
done
all

extra
thumping

thank
you
as
one
to

i
may
say
i
would
wish
to
eat
the
puddin
of
three
finer
fellers
than
yourselves
with
this
cordial
understanding
they
set
about
preparing
the
camp
fire
and
the
heartiest
expressions
of
friendship
were
indulged
in
while
the
puddin
was
being
passed
round

bunyip
aptly
remarked

he
can
surely
pardon
her
who
claims
as
guest
our
courteous
market
gardener
to
which
benjimen
handsomely
replied
happier
he
who
meets
three
whose
puddin
is
the
equal
of
its
donors
and
indeed
a
very
pleasant
evening
they
had
round
the
camp
fire
fourth
slice
is
what
i
call
satisfactory
said
bill
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
next
morning
a
great
relief
to
the
mind
to
know
that
them
is
sufferin
the
agonies
of
remorse
and
that
our
puddin
is
safe
from
bein
stolen
every
ten
minutes
a
old
optimist
said
the
puddin
rudely
never
suffer
from
remorse
they
only
suffer
from
blighted
hopes
and
suppressed
activity
you
no
trust
in
human
nature
albert
asked
bill
sternly
you
know
that
nothin
gives
a
man
greater
remorse
than
havin
his
face
punched
his
toes
trod
on
and
eggs
rubbed
in
his
hair
have
grave
doubts
myself
said
bunyip
bluegum
to
the
sincerity
of
their
repentance
and
ben
brandysnap
said
that
speaking
as
a
market
gardener
his
experience
of
carrot
catchers
onion
snatchers
pumpkin
pouncers
and
cabbage
grabbers
induced
him
to
hold
the
opinion
that
shooting
them
with
was
the
only
sure
way
to
make
them
feel
remorse
in
fact
as
sam
said
howls
and
groans
of
pain
and
grief
the
accents
of
remorse
extracted
from
a
are
all
put
on
of
course
all
i
can
say
is
cried
bill
enraged
there
any
more
of
this
business
of
disguised
as
firemen
stealing
our
puddin
and
not
disguised
at
all
shovin
bags
over
our
heads
blow
me
if
i
do
give
up
in
despair
and
take
to
keepin
carrots
for
a
livin
the
puddin
was
so
furious
at
this
remark
that
they
were
forced
to
eat
an
extra
slice
all
round
to
pacify
him
in
spite
of
which
he
called
bill
a
old
and
other
insulting
names
however
at
length
they
set
out
on
the
road
bill
continuing
to
air
some
very
despondent
remarks
what
is
the
good
of
havin
a
noble
trustin
nature
said
he
every
low
in
the
land
to
take
advantage
of
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
punch
every
snout
we
meet
and
chance
the
odds
it
belongs
to
a
said
bunyip
bluegum
see
you
are
not
your
wonted
self
this
morning
as
a
means
of
promoting
the
general
gaiety
i
call
on
you
to
sing
the
junk
without
delay
this
was
immediately
effective
and
bill
with
the
greatest
heartiness
roared
out
aboard
the
junk

round

to
state
he
kissed

home
across

punched
his
nose
and
banged
him
on
the
dome
at
about
the
fifteenth
verse
they
came
to
the
town
of
tooraloo
and
that
put
a
stop
to
the
singing
because
you
ca
sing
in
the
public
streets
unless
you
are
a
musician
or
a
nuisance
the
town
of
tooraloo
is
one
of
those
dozing
snoozing
places
where
all
the
people
who
are
asleep
are
only
half
awake
and
where
dogs
pass
away
their
lives
on
the
footpaths
and
you
fall
over
cows
when
taking
your
evening
stroll

there
was
a
surprise
awaiting
them
at
tooraloo
for
the
moment
they
arrived
two
persons
in

coats
ran
out
from
behind
a
fence
and
fell
flat
on
their
backs
in
the
middle
of
the
road
yelling
help
thieves
and
ruffians

work
the
travellers
naturally
stared
with
amazement
at
this
peculiar
conduct
the
moment
the
persons
in
caught
sight
of
them
they
sprang
up
and
striking
an
attitude
expressive
of
horror
shouted
the

calling
this
a

it
a
respectable
grand
digestive
puddin
and
any
fellers
in
sayin
it
a
stolen

is
scoundrels
of
the
deepest
dye
use
such
words
to
people
wearing
said
one
of
the
and
the
other
added
that
dear
puddin
gazing
up
to
heaven
how
can
you
use
such
words
very
fine
no
doubt
sneered
bill
if
you
ai
scoundrels
of
the
deepest
dye
remove
them

and
prove
you
ai
afraid
to
look

and
colds
in

and
doctor
orders
my
doctor
said
to
me
only
this
morning
never

those
were
his
words

save
the
king
neither
said
the
other
your
conduct
be
noble
and
never
sing
the
national
anthem
to
people
wearing
fact
said
the
first
we
say
is
hand
over
the
puddin
with
a
few
words
and
all
will
be
dropped
bill
was
so
enraged
at
this
suggestion
that
he
dashed
his
hat
on
the
ground
and
kicked
it
to
relieve
his
feelings
or
no
law
he
shouted
call
on
all
hands
to
knock
them
off
all
hands
made
a
rush
for
the
who
shouted
englishman

they
were
overpowered
by
numbers

were
snatched

disguised
that
snooting
snouting

there
was
an
immense
uproar
over
this

bill
and
sam
flapping
and
away
at
the
the
roaring
for
mercy
ben
denounced
them
as
bag
snatchers
and
bunyip
bluegum
expressed
his
indignation
in
a
fine
burst
of
oratory
beginning
indeed
must
be
those
scoundrels
who
lost
to
all
sense
of
decency
and
honour
boldly
assume
the
outward
semblance
of
worthy
citizens
and
by
the
pretentious
nature
of
their
appearance
not
only
seek
the
better
to
impose
upon
the
noble
credulity

with
dastardly
cunning

the

the

a
little
fat
breathless
man

hastened
with
difficulty
owing
to
his
robe
of

being
trodden
on

the
constable

close
behind
him
in
order
to
finish
eating
a
banana
in
secret
he
had
some
more
bananas
in
a
paper
bag
and
his
face
was
one
of

feeble
faces
that

of
eggs
and
carrots
and
feathers

how
runs
the
axiom

you
have
to

him

albert
till
the

well
and
truly
tried
by
these

noble
peers
of
the
realm
assembled
said
bill
impressively
much
style
about
you
said
the
puddin
rudely
and
he
threw
the
judge
glass
of
port
into
bill
face
remarking
that
for
being
a
old
shellback
there
was
a
great
uproar
over
this
very
illegal
act
the
judge
was
enraged
at
losing
his
port
and
the
mayor
was
filled
with
horror
because
bill
wiped
his
face
on
the
mayoral
hat
sam
had
to
feign
amazement
at
being
called
a
liar
and
the
kept
shouting
time
we
ca
stand
here
all
day
illustration
in
desperation
bill
bawled
at
the
top
of
his
voice
call
on
detective
bluegum
to
restore
order
in
the
court
bunyip
ran
into
the
and
with
a
ready
wit
shouted
have
dreadful
news
to
impart
to
this
honourable
court
all
eyes
of
course
turned
on
bunyip
who
raising
his
hand
with
an
impressive
gesture
said
in
thrilling
tones
information
received
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
puddin
was
poisoned
at
this
morning
this
news
restored
order
at
once
the
judge
turned
pale
as
lard
and
the
usher
having
a
darker
complexion
turned
as
pale
as
soap
the
could
turn
pale
so
he
let
out
a
howl
of
terror
said
the
usher
feebly
how
said
the
judge
feeling
his
stomach
with
trembling
hands
this
moment
i
was
under
the
delusion
that
a
somewhat
unpleasant
sensation
of
being
as
it
were
distended
was
merely
due
to
having
eaten
seven
slices
but
if
illustration
said
the
usher
in
a
quavering
voice
you
take
a
poisoned
and
that
poisoned
puddin
chew
the
sensations
that
you
suffer
i
should
rather
say
were
due
to
the
poison
in
the
in
the
act
of
poisoning
you
and
i
think
the
fact
suffices
through
this
dreadfulest
of
crimes
as
you
eaten
seven
slices
you
been
poisoned
seven
times
was
your
idea
having
it
up
on
the
bench
said
the
judge
angrily
to
the
usher
what
you
say
is
true
that
idea
you
sadly
rue
the
poison
i
have
eaten
is
entirely
due
to
you
it
by
taking
your
advice
that
i
had
my
seventh
slice
so
i
tell
you
what
i
do
why
i
beat
you
black
and
blue
and
with
that
he
hit
the
usher
a
smart
crack
on
the
head
with
a
port
bottle
strike
a
poisoned
man
shouted
the
usher
but
the
judge
went
on
smacking
and
cracking
him
with
the
bottle
singing
emotion
of
pity
need
never
be
sought
in
a
judge
who
been
poisoned
by
puddin
and
port
in
desperation
the
usher
leapt
off
the
bench
and
landed
head
first
in
the
dock
where
he
stuck
like
a
sardine
illustration
bad
too
bad
shouted
the
in
here
where
there
only
room
for
two
before
they
could
get
rid
of
the
usher
the
judge
bounded
over
the
bench
and
commenced
whacking
them
with
the
bottle
singing
i
find
great
satisfaction
hitting
anybody
who
can
offer
that
distraction
why
i
have
a
go
at
you
and
he
went
on
bounding
and
whacking
away
with
the
bottle
while
the
kept
roaring
and
the
usher
kept
screaming
the
uproar
was
deafening
listen
to
it
said
bill
in
despair
like
to
know
how
on
earth
we
are
going
to
finish
the
case
with
all
this
umptydoodle
rumpus
going
on
said
bunyip
simpler
course
is
not
to
finish
the
case
at
all
as
usual
said
bill
and
seizing
the
puddin
from
the
bench
he
dashed
out
of
court
followed
by
sam
ben
and
bunyip
bluegum
as
they
ran
they
could
hear
the
judge
still
whacking
away
at
everybody
including
the
mayor
and
the
constable
whose
screams
were
piercing
said
bunyip
rather
think
they
rather
rue
the
haste
with
which
they
sought
to
sue
us
in
the
court
of
tooraloo
for
mark
how
just
is
fate
whole
benighted
blooming
crew
the
the
usher
too
are
being
beaten
black
and
blue
with
bottles
on
the
pate
rather
think
they
will
eschew
in
future
who
pass
through
the
simple
rural
view
about
the
town
of
tooraloo
now
said
bill
when
they
had
run
a
mile
or
two
beyond
the
town
now
for
some
brilliant
plan
swiftly
conceived
which
will
put
a
stop
to
this
business
for
ever
for
the
point
is
continued
bill
lowering
his
voice
we
are
pretty
close
up
to
the
end
of
the
book
and
something
will
have
to
be
done
in
a
tremendous
hurry
or
else
we
be
cut
off
short
by
the
cover
solution
is
perfectly
simple
said
bunyip
have
merely
to
stop
wandering
along
the
road
and
the
story
will
stop
wandering
through
the
book
this
too
will
baffle
the
for
while
we
wander
along
the
road
our
puddin
is
exposed
to
the
covetous
glances
of
every
passing
let
us
then
remove
to
some
safe
secluded
spot
and
settle
down
to
a
life
of
gaiety
dance
and
song
where
no
will
dare
to
show
a
sacrilegious
head
let
us
in
fact
build
a
house
in
a
tree
for
mark
the
advantages
of
such
a
habitation
on
high
no
neighbours
pry
in
at
the
window
on
the
sly
in
a
tree
you
always
free
from
bores
and
bailiffs
you
agree
on
high
bricks
you
shy
at
bores
and
bailiffs
passing
by
in
the
leaves
one
never
grieves
over
the
pranks
of
you
would
be
gay
and
free
take
my
tip
and
live
in
a
tree
will
we
will
shouted
the
but
the
puddin
said
sourly
is
all
very
well
all
this
high
falutin
but
what
about
the
dreadful
news
of
being
poisoned
at
this
morning
ai
poisoned
albert
said
bill
was
only
a
mere
de
as
they
say
in
the
noosepapers
what
demanded
the
puddin
suspiciously
words
be
sufficient
without
explanation
said
bill
severely
as
we
have
time
to
waste
talkin
philosophy
to
a
puddin
why
into
the
bag
he
goes
or
we
never
get
the
story
finished
so
puddin
was
bundled
into
the
bag
and
bill
said
hurriedly
as
our
friend
bunyip
had
proved
himself
with
his
ready
wit
it
remains
for
old
bill
to
suggest
the
brightest
idea
of
all
here
is
our
friend
ben
a
market
gardener
of
the
finest
description
very
well
why
not
build
our
house
in
his
market
garden
the
advantages
are
obvious
vegetables
free
of
charge
the
whole
year
round
and
fruit
in
season
eggs
to
be
had
for
the
askin
and
a
fine
simple
honest
feller
like
ben
to
chat
to
of
an
evening
what
could
be
more
delightful
ben
looked
very
grave
at
this
proposal
and
began
very
much
doubt
whether
there
will
be
enough
bed
clothes
for
four
people
let
alone
the
carrots
are
very
nervous
of
strangers
when
bill
cut
him
short
with
a
hearty
clap
on
the
back
no
more
said
bill
handsomely
fellers
like
us
do
need
apologies
or
any
social
at
all
we
take
you
as
we
find
you
without
more
ado
we
shall
build
a
house
in
your
market
garden
and
without
more
ado
they
did
the
picture
overleaf
saves
the
trouble
of
explaining
how
they
built
it
and
what
a
splendid
house
it
is
in
order
that
the
puddin
might
have
plenty
of
exercise
they
made
him
a
little
puddin
paddock
whence
he
can
shout
rude
remarks
to
the
people
passing
by
a
habit
i
grieve
to
state
he
is
very
prone
to
illustration
of
course
at
night
they
pull
up
the
ladder
in
case
a
stray
happens
to
be
prowling
around
if
a
friend
calls
to
have
a
quiet
chat
or
to
join
in
a
round
the
fire
they
let
the
ladder
down
for
him
and
a
very
pleasant
life
they
lead
sitting
of
a
summer
evening
on
the
balcony
while
ben
does
his
little
jobs
below
and
the
puddin
throws
bits
of
bark
at
the
cabbages
and
pulls
faces
at
the
little
pickle
onions
in
order
to
make
them
squeak
with
terror
on
winter
nights
there
is
always
puddin
and
hot
coffee
for
supper
and
many
the
good
go
in
i
had
up
there
round
the
fire
i
did
mean
to
let
on
that
i
knew
their
address
on
account
of
so
many
people
wanting
to
have
a
go
at
the
puddin
however
it
out
now
when
the
wind
blows
and
the
rain
comes
down
it
jolly
sitting
up
aloft
in
the
snug
especially
when
old
bill
is
in
good
form
and
gives
us
the
junk
with
all
hands
joining
in
the
chorus
rolling
round
the
ocean
from
a
far
and
foreign
land
may
suit
the
common
notion
that
a
sailor
life
is
grand
as
for
me
i
sooner
be
here
at
home
about
the
rolling
roaring
life
of
them
that
sails
the
foam
the
chorus
which
he
roars
across
the
foam
is
all
about
chucking
a
sailor
life
and
settling
down
at
home
home
home
that
the
song
of
them
that
roam
the
song
of
the
roaring
rolling
sea
is
all
about
rolling
home
