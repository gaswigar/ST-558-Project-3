the

chapter
i
yes
he
was
the
most
beautiful
prince
that
ever
was
born
of
course
being
a
prince
people
said
this
but
it
was
true
besides
when
he
looked
at
the
candle
his
eyes
had
an
expression
of
earnest
inquiry
quite
startling
in
a
baby
his
nose
there
was
not
much
of
it
certainly
but
what
there
was
seemed
an
aquiline
shape
his
complexion
was
a
charming
healthy
purple
he
was
round
and
fat
and
long
in
fact
a
splendid
baby
and
everybody
was
exceedingly
proud
of
him
especially
his
father
and
mother
the
king
and
queen
of
nomansland
who
had
waited
for
him
during
their
happy
reign
of
ten
years
now
made
happier
than
ever
to
themselves
and
their
subjects
by
the
appearance
of
a
son
and
heir
the
only
person
who
was
not
quite
happy
was
the
king
brother
the
who
would
have
been
king
one
day
had
the
baby
not
been
born
but
as
his
majesty
was
very
kind
to
him
and
even
rather
sorry
for
him
insomuch
that
at
the
queen
request
he
gave
him
a
dukedom
almost
as
big
as
a
county
the
crown
prince
as
he
was
called
tried
to
seem
pleased
also
and
let
us
hope
he
succeeded
the
prince
christening
was
to
be
a
grand
affair
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
there
were
chosen
for
him
godfathers
and
godmothers
who
each
had
to
give
him
a
name
and
promise
to
do
their
utmost
for
him
when
he
came
of
age
he
himself
had
to
choose
the
name
and
the
or
godmother
that
he
liked
best
for
the
rest
of
his
days
meantime
all
was
rejoicing
subscriptions
were
made
among
the
rich
to
give
pleasure
to
the
poor
dinners
in
for
the
working
men
in
the
streets
for
their
wives
and
milk
and
bun
feasts
for
the
children
in
the
schoolrooms
for
nomansland
though
i
can
not
point
it
out
in
any
map
or
read
of
it
in
any
history
was
i
believe
much
like
our
own
or
many
another
country
as
for
the
palace
which
was
no
different
from
other
palaces
it
was
clean
turned
out
of
the
windows
as
people
say
with
the
preparations
going
on
the
only
quiet
place
in
it
was
the
room
which
though
the
prince
was
six
weeks
old
his
mother
the
queen
had
never
quitted
nobody
said
she
was
ill
however
it
would
have
been
so
inconvenient
and
as
she
said
nothing
about
it
herself
but
lay
pale
and
placid
giving
no
trouble
to
anybody
nobody
thought
much
about
her
all
the
world
was
absorbed
in
admiring
the
baby
illustration
the
people
in
the
palace
were
lovely
too
or
thought
themselves
so
from
the
down
illustration
poor
little
kitchenmaid
in
her
pink
cotton
gown
thought
doubtless
there
never
was
such
a
pretty
the
came
at
last
and
it
was
as
lovely
as
the
prince
himself
all
the
people
in
the
palace
were
lovely
too
or
thought
themselves
so
in
the
elegant
new
clothes
which
the
queen
who
thought
of
everybody
had
taken
care
to
give
them
from
the
down
to
the
poor
little
kitchenmaid
who
looked
at
herself
in
her
pink
cotton
gown
and
thought
doubtless
that
there
never
was
such
a
pretty
girl
as
she
by
six
in
the
morning
all
the
royal
household
had
dressed
itself
in
its
very
best
and
then
the
little
prince
was
dressed
in
his
best
his
magnificent
which
proceeding
his
royal
highness
did
not
like
at
all
but
kicked
and
screamed
like
any
common
baby
when
he
had
a
little
calmed
down
they
carried
him
to
be
looked
at
by
the
queen
his
mother
who
though
her
royal
robes
had
been
brought
and
laid
upon
the
bed
was
as
everybody
well
knew
quite
unable
to
rise
and
put
them
on
she
admired
her
baby
very
much
kissed
and
blessed
him
and
lay
looking
at
him
as
she
did
for
hours
sometimes
when
he
was
placed
beside
her
fast
asleep
then
she
gave
him
up
with
a
gentle
smile
and
saying
she
hoped
he
would
be
very
good
that
it
would
be
a
very
nice
christening
and
all
the
guests
would
enjoy
themselves
turned
peacefully
over
on
her
bed
saying
nothing
more
to
anybody
she
was
a
very
uncomplaining
person
the
queen
and
her
name
was
dolorez
everything
went
on
exactly
as
if
she
had
been
present
all
even
the
king
himself
had
grown
used
to
her
absence
for
she
was
not
strong
and
for
years
had
not
joined
in
any
gaieties
she
always
did
her
royal
duties
but
as
to
pleasures
they
could
go
on
quite
well
without
her
or
it
seemed
so
the
company
arrived
great
and
notable
persons
in
this
and
neighboring
countries
also
the
godfathers
and
godmothers
who
had
been
chosen
with
care
as
the
people
who
would
be
most
useful
to
his
royal
highness
should
he
ever
want
friends
which
did
not
seem
likely
what
such
want
could
possibly
happen
to
the
heir
of
the
powerful
monarch
of
nomansland
they
came
walking
two
and
two
with
their
coronets
on
their
heads
being
dukes
and
duchesses
prince
and
princesses
or
the
like
they
all
kissed
the
child
and
pronounced
the
name
which
each
had
given
him
then
the
names
were
shouted
out
with
great
energy
by
six
heralds
one
after
the
other
and
afterwards
written
down
to
be
preserved
in
the
state
records
in
readiness
for
the
next
time
they
were
wanted
which
would
be
either
on
his
royal
highness
coronation
or
his
funeral
soon
the
ceremony
was
over
and
everybody
satisfied
except
perhaps
the
little
prince
himself
who
moaned
faintly
under
his
christening
robes
which
nearly
smothered
him
in
truth
though
very
few
knew
the
prince
in
coming
to
the
chapel
had
met
with
a
slight
disaster
his
nurse
not
his
ordinary
one
but
the
state
nursemaid
an
elegant
and
fashionable
young
lady
of
rank
whose
duty
it
was
to
carry
him
to
and
from
the
chapel
had
been
so
occupied
in
arranging
her
train
with
one
hand
while
she
held
the
baby
with
the
other
that
she
stumbled
and
let
him
fall
just
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
staircase
to
be
sure
she
contrived
to
pick
him
up
again
the
next
minute
and
the
accident
was
so
slight
it
seemed
hardly
worth
speaking
of
consequently
nobody
did
speak
of
it
the
baby
had
turned
deadly
pale
but
did
not
cry
so
no
person
a
step
or
two
behind
could
discover
anything
wrong
afterwards
even
if
he
had
moaned
the
silver
trumpets
were
loud
enough
to
drown
his
voice
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
let
anything
trouble
such
a
day
of
felicity
so
after
a
minute
pause
the
procession
had
moved
on
such
a
procession
heralds
in
blue
and
silver
pages
in
crimson
and
gold
and
a
troop
of
little
girls
in
dazzling
white
carrying
baskets
of
flowers
which
they
strewed
all
the
way
before
the
nurse
and
child
finally
the
godfathers
and
godmothers
as
proud
as
possible
and
so
splendid
to
look
at
that
they
would
have
quite
extinguished
their
small
godson
merely
a
heap
of
lace
and
muslin
with
a
inside
had
it
not
been
for
a
canopy
of
white
satin
and
ostrich
feathers
which
was
held
over
him
wherever
he
was
carried
illustration
procession
had
moved
on
such
a
procession
heralds
in
blue
and
silver
pages
in
crimson
and
thus
with
the
sun
shining
on
them
through
the
painted
windows
they
stood
the
king
and
his
train
on
one
side
the
prince
and
his
attendants
on
the
other
as
pretty
a
sight
as
ever
was
seen
out
of
fairyland
it
just
like
fairyland
whispered
the
eldest
little
girl
to
the
next
eldest
as
she
shook
the
last
rose
out
of
her
basket
and
i
think
the
only
thing
the
prince
wants
now
is
a
fairy
godmother
does
he
said
a
shrill
but
soft
and
not
unpleasant
voice
behind
and
there
was
seen
among
the
group
of
children
somebody
not
a
child
yet
no
bigger
than
a
child
somebody
whom
nobody
had
seen
before
and
who
certainly
had
not
been
invited
for
she
had
no
christening
clothes
on
she
was
a
little
old
woman
dressed
all
in
grey
grey
gown
grey
hooded
cloak
of
a
material
excessively
fine
and
a
tint
that
seemed
perpetually
changing
like
the
grey
of
an
evening
sky
her
hair
was
grey
and
her
eyes
also
even
her
complexion
had
a
soft
grey
shadow
over
it
but
there
was
nothing
unpleasantly
old
about
her
and
her
smile
was
as
sweet
and
childlike
as
the
prince
own
which
stole
over
his
pale
little
face
the
instant
she
came
near
enough
to
touch
him
take
care
do
let
the
baby
fall
again
the
grand
young
lady
nurse
started
flushing
angrily
who
spoke
to
me
how
did
anybody
know
i
mean
what
business
has
anybody
then
frightened
but
still
speaking
in
a
much
sharper
tone
than
i
hope
young
ladies
of
rank
are
in
the
habit
of
speaking
old
woman
you
will
be
kind
enough
not
to
say
baby
but
prince
keep
away
his
royal
highness
is
just
going
to
sleep
nevertheless
i
must
kiss
him
i
am
his
godmother
you
cried
the
elegant
lady
nurse
you
repeated
all
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
waiting
you
echoed
the
heralds
and
pages
and
they
began
to
blow
the
silver
trumpets
in
order
to
stop
all
further
conversation
the
prince
procession
formed
itself
for
returning
the
king
and
his
train
having
already
moved
off
towards
the
palace
but
on
the
topmost
step
of
the
marble
stairs
stood
right
in
front
of
all
the
little
old
woman
clothed
in
grey
she
stretched
herself
on
tiptoe
by
the
help
of
her
stick
and
gave
the
little
prince
three
kisses
this
is
intolerable
cried
the
young
lady
nurse
wiping
the
kisses
off
rapidly
with
her
lace
handkerchief
such
an
insult
to
his
royal
highness
take
yourself
out
of
the
way
old
woman
or
the
king
shall
be
informed
immediately
the
king
knows
nothing
of
me
more
the
pity
replied
the
old
woman
with
an
indifferent
air
as
if
she
thought
the
loss
was
more
on
his
majesty
side
than
hers
my
friend
in
the
palace
is
the
king
wife
kings
wives
are
called
queens
said
the
lady
nurse
with
a
contemptuous
air
you
are
right
replied
the
old
woman
nevertheless
i
know
her
majesty
well
and
i
love
her
and
her
child
and
since
you
dropped
him
on
the
marble
stairs
this
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
which
made
the
young
lady
tremble
in
spite
of
her
anger
i
choose
to
take
him
for
my
own
i
am
his
godmother
ready
to
help
him
whenever
he
wants
me
you
help
him
cried
all
the
group
breaking
into
shouts
of
laughter
to
which
the
little
old
woman
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
her
soft
grey
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
prince
who
seemed
to
answer
to
the
look
smiling
again
and
again
in
causeless
aimless
fashion
as
babies
do
smile
his
majesty
must
hear
of
this
said
a
his
majesty
will
hear
quite
enough
news
in
a
minute
or
two
said
the
old
woman
sadly
and
again
stretching
up
to
the
little
prince
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
solemnly
be
called
by
a
new
name
which
nobody
has
ever
thought
of
be
prince
dolor
in
memory
of
your
mother
dolorez
in
memory
of
everybody
started
at
the
ominous
phrase
and
also
at
a
most
terrible
breach
of
etiquette
which
the
old
woman
had
committed
in
nomansland
neither
the
king
nor
the
queen
were
supposed
to
have
any
christian
name
at
all
they
dropped
it
on
their
and
it
was
never
mentioned
again
till
it
was
engraved
on
their
coffins
when
they
died
old
woman
you
are
exceedingly
cried
the
eldest
much
horrified
how
you
could
know
the
fact
passes
my
comprehension
but
even
if
you
did
not
know
it
how
dared
you
presume
to
hint
that
her
most
gracious
majesty
is
called
dolorez
called
dolorez
said
the
old
woman
with
a
tender
solemnity
the
first
gentleman
called
the
raised
it
to
strike
her
and
all
the
rest
stretched
out
their
hands
to
seize
her
but
the
grey
mantle
melted
from
between
their
fingers
like
air
and
before
anybody
had
time
to
do
anything
more
there
came
a
heavy
muffled
startling
sound
the
great
bell
of
the
palace
the
bell
which
was
only
heard
on
the
death
of
some
of
the
royal
family
and
for
as
many
times
as
he
or
she
was
years
old
began
to
toll
they
listened
mute
and
some
one
counted
one
two
three
four
up
to
nine
and
twenty
just
the
queen
age
it
was
indeed
the
queen
her
majesty
was
dead
in
the
midst
of
the
festivities
she
had
slipped
away
out
of
her
new
happiness
and
her
old
sufferings
neither
few
nor
small
sending
away
her
women
to
see
the
sight
at
least
they
said
afterwards
in
excuse
that
she
had
done
so
and
it
was
very
like
her
to
do
it
she
had
turned
with
her
face
to
the
window
whence
one
could
just
see
the
tops
of
the
distant
mountains
the
beautiful
mountains
as
they
were
called
where
she
was
born
so
gazing
she
had
quietly
died
when
the
little
prince
was
carried
back
to
his
mother
room
there
was
no
mother
to
kiss
him
and
though
he
did
not
know
it
there
would
be
for
him
no
mother
kiss
any
more
as
for
his
godmother
the
little
old
woman
in
grey
who
called
herself
so
whether
she
melted
into
air
like
her
gown
when
they
touched
it
or
whether
she
flew
out
of
the
chapel
window
or
slipped
through
the
doorway
among
the
bewildered
crowd
nobody
knew
nobody
ever
thought
about
her
only
the
nurse
the
ordinary
homely
one
coming
out
of
the
nursery
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
search
of
a
cordial
to
quiet
his
continual
moans
saw
sitting
in
the
doorway
something
which
she
would
have
thought
a
mere
shadow
had
she
not
seen
shining
out
of
it
two
eyes
grey
and
soft
and
sweet
she
put
her
hand
before
her
own
screaming
loudly
when
she
took
them
away
the
old
woman
was
gone
chapter
ii
everybody
was
very
kind
to
the
poor
little
prince
i
think
people
generally
are
kind
to
motherless
children
whether
princes
or
peasants
he
had
a
magnificent
nursery
and
a
regular
suite
of
attendants
and
was
treated
with
the
greatest
respect
and
state
nobody
was
allowed
to
talk
to
him
in
silly
baby
language
or
dandle
him
or
above
all
to
kiss
him
though
perhaps
some
people
did
it
surreptitiously
for
he
was
such
a
sweet
baby
that
it
was
difficult
to
help
it
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
prince
missed
his
mother
children
of
his
age
can
not
do
that
but
somehow
after
she
died
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
with
him
from
a
beautiful
baby
he
became
sickly
and
pale
seeming
to
have
almost
ceased
growing
especially
in
his
legs
which
had
been
so
fat
and
strong
but
after
the
day
of
his
christening
they
withered
and
shrank
he
no
longer
kicked
them
out
either
in
passion
or
play
and
when
as
he
got
to
be
nearly
a
year
old
his
nurse
tried
to
make
him
stand
upon
them
he
only
tumbled
down
this
happened
so
many
times
that
at
last
people
began
to
talk
about
it
a
prince
and
not
able
to
stand
on
his
own
legs
what
a
dreadful
thing
what
a
misfortune
for
the
country
rather
a
misfortune
to
him
also
poor
little
boy
but
nobody
seemed
to
think
of
that
and
when
after
a
while
his
health
revived
and
the
old
bright
look
came
back
to
his
sweet
little
face
and
his
body
grew
larger
and
stronger
though
still
his
legs
remained
the
same
people
continued
to
speak
of
him
in
whispers
and
with
grave
shakes
of
the
head
everybody
knew
though
nobody
said
it
that
something
impossible
to
guess
what
was
not
quite
right
with
the
poor
little
prince
of
course
nobody
hinted
this
to
the
king
his
father
it
does
not
do
to
tell
great
people
anything
unpleasant
and
besides
his
majesty
took
very
little
notice
of
his
son
or
of
his
other
affairs
beyond
the
necessary
duties
of
his
kingdom
people
had
said
he
would
not
miss
the
queen
at
all
she
having
been
so
long
an
invalid
but
he
did
after
her
death
he
never
was
quite
the
same
he
established
himself
in
her
empty
rooms
the
only
rooms
in
the
palace
whence
one
could
see
the
beautiful
mountains
and
was
often
observed
looking
at
them
as
if
he
thought
she
had
flown
away
thither
and
that
his
longing
could
bring
her
back
again
and
by
a
curious
coincidence
which
nobody
dared
to
inquire
into
he
desired
that
the
prince
might
be
called
not
by
any
of
the
grand
names
given
him
by
his
godfathers
and
godmothers
but
by
the
identical
name
mentioned
by
the
little
old
woman
in
grey
dolor
after
his
mother
dolorez
once
a
week
according
to
established
state
custom
the
prince
dressed
in
his
very
best
was
brought
to
the
king
his
father
for
but
his
majesty
was
generally
too
ill
and
too
melancholy
to
pay
much
heed
to
the
child
only
once
when
he
and
the
crown
prince
who
was
exceedingly
attentive
to
his
royal
brother
were
sitting
together
with
prince
dolor
playing
in
a
corner
of
the
room
dragging
himself
about
with
his
arms
rather
than
his
legs
and
sometimes
trying
feebly
to
crawl
from
one
chair
to
another
it
seemed
to
strike
the
father
that
all
was
not
right
with
his
son
how
old
is
his
royal
highness
said
he
suddenly
to
the
nurse
two
years
three
months
and
five
days
please
your
majesty
illustration
how
old
is
his
royal
highness
said
he
suddenly
to
the
it
does
not
please
me
said
the
king
with
a
sigh
he
ought
to
be
far
more
forward
than
he
is
now
ought
he
not
brother
you
who
have
so
many
children
must
know
is
there
not
something
wrong
about
him
oh
no
said
the
crown
prince
exchanging
meaning
looks
with
the
nurse
who
did
not
understand
at
all
but
stood
frightened
and
trembling
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
nothing
to
make
your
majesty
at
all
uneasy
no
doubt
his
royal
highness
will
outgrow
it
in
time
outgrow
what
a
slight
delicacy
ahem
in
the
spine
something
inherited
perhaps
from
his
dear
mother
ah
she
was
always
delicate
but
she
was
the
sweetest
woman
that
ever
lived
come
here
my
little
son
and
as
the
prince
turned
round
upon
his
father
a
small
sweet
grave
face
so
like
his
mother
his
majesty
the
king
smiled
and
held
out
his
arms
but
when
the
boy
came
to
him
not
running
like
a
boy
but
wriggling
awkwardly
along
the
floor
the
royal
countenance
clouded
over
i
ought
to
have
been
told
of
this
it
is
terrible
terrible
and
for
a
prince
too
send
for
all
the
doctors
in
my
kingdom
immediately
they
came
and
each
gave
a
different
opinion
and
ordered
a
different
mode
of
treatment
the
only
thing
they
agreed
in
was
what
had
been
pretty
well
known
before
that
the
prince
must
have
been
hurt
when
he
was
an
infant
let
fall
perhaps
so
as
to
injure
his
spine
and
lower
limbs
did
nobody
remember
no
nobody
indignantly
all
the
nurses
denied
that
any
such
accident
had
happened
was
possible
to
have
happened
until
the
faithful
country
nurse
recollected
that
it
really
had
happened
on
the
day
of
the
christening
for
which
unluckily
good
memory
all
the
others
scolded
her
so
severely
that
she
had
no
peace
of
her
life
and
soon
after
by
the
influence
of
the
young
lady
nurse
who
had
carried
the
baby
that
fatal
day
and
who
was
a
sort
of
connection
of
the
crown
prince
being
his
wife
second
cousin
once
removed
the
poor
woman
was
pensioned
off
and
sent
to
the
beautiful
mountains
from
whence
she
came
with
orders
to
remain
there
for
the
rest
of
her
days
but
of
all
this
the
king
knew
nothing
for
indeed
after
the
first
shock
of
finding
out
that
his
son
could
not
walk
and
seemed
never
likely
to
walk
he
interfered
very
little
concerning
him
the
whole
thing
was
too
painful
and
his
majesty
had
never
liked
painful
things
sometimes
he
inquired
after
prince
dolor
and
they
told
him
his
royal
highness
was
going
on
as
well
as
could
be
expected
which
really
was
the
case
for
after
worrying
the
poor
child
and
perplexing
themselves
with
one
remedy
after
another
the
crown
prince
not
wishing
to
offend
any
of
the
differing
doctors
had
proposed
leaving
him
to
nature
and
nature
the
safest
doctor
of
all
had
come
to
his
help
and
done
her
best
he
could
not
walk
it
is
true
his
limbs
were
mere
useless
additions
to
his
body
but
the
body
itself
was
strong
and
sound
and
his
face
was
the
same
as
ever
just
his
mother
face
one
of
the
sweetest
in
the
world
even
the
king
indifferent
as
he
was
sometimes
looked
at
the
little
fellow
with
sad
tenderness
noticing
how
cleverly
he
learned
to
crawl
and
swing
himself
about
by
his
arms
so
that
in
his
own
awkward
way
he
was
as
active
in
motion
as
most
children
of
his
age
poor
little
man
he
does
his
best
and
he
is
not
unhappy
not
half
so
unhappy
as
i
brother
addressing
the
crown
prince
who
was
more
constant
than
ever
in
his
attendance
upon
the
sick
monarch
if
anything
should
befall
me
i
have
appointed
you
as
regent
in
case
of
my
death
you
will
take
care
of
my
poor
little
boy
certainly
certainly
but
do
not
let
us
imagine
any
such
misfortune
i
assure
your
majesty
everybody
will
assure
you
that
it
is
not
in
the
least
likely
he
knew
however
and
everybody
knew
that
it
was
likely
and
soon
after
it
actually
did
happen
the
king
died
as
suddenly
and
quietly
as
the
queen
had
done
indeed
in
her
very
room
and
bed
and
prince
dolor
was
left
without
either
father
or
mother
as
sad
a
thing
as
could
happen
even
to
a
prince
he
was
more
than
that
now
though
he
was
a
king
in
nomansland
as
in
other
countries
the
people
were
struck
with
grief
one
day
and
revived
the
next
the
king
is
dead
long
live
the
king
was
the
cry
that
rang
through
the
nation
and
almost
before
his
late
majesty
had
been
laid
beside
the
queen
in
their
splendid
mausoleum
crowds
came
thronging
from
all
parts
of
the
royal
palace
eager
to
see
the
new
monarch
they
did
see
him
the
prince
regent
took
care
they
should
sitting
on
the
floor
of
the
sucking
his
thumb
and
when
one
of
the
lifted
him
up
and
carried
him
fancy
carrying
a
king
to
the
chair
of
state
and
put
the
crown
on
his
head
he
shook
it
off
again
it
was
so
heavy
and
uncomfortable
sliding
down
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
he
began
playing
with
the
golden
lions
that
supported
it
stroking
their
paws
and
putting
his
tiny
fingers
into
their
eyes
and
laughing
laughing
as
if
he
had
at
last
found
something
to
amuse
him
there
a
fine
king
for
you
said
the
first
a
friend
of
the
prince
regent
the
crown
prince
that
used
to
be
who
in
the
deepest
mourning
stood
silently
beside
the
throne
of
his
young
nephew
he
was
a
handsome
man
very
grand
and
clever
looking
what
a
king
who
can
never
stand
to
receive
his
subjects
never
walk
in
processions
who
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
will
have
to
be
carried
about
like
a
baby
very
unfortunate
exceedingly
unfortunate
repeated
the
second
lord
it
is
always
bad
for
a
nation
when
its
king
is
a
child
but
such
a
child
a
permanent
cripple
if
not
worse
let
us
hope
not
worse
said
the
first
lord
in
a
very
hopeless
tone
and
looking
towards
the
regent
who
stood
erect
and
pretended
to
hear
nothing
i
have
heard
that
these
sort
of
children
with
very
large
heads
and
great
broad
foreheads
and
staring
eyes
are
well
well
let
us
hope
for
the
best
and
be
prepared
for
the
worst
in
the
meantime
i
swear
said
the
crown
prince
coming
forward
and
kissing
the
hilt
of
his
sword
i
swear
to
perform
my
duties
as
regent
to
take
all
care
of
his
royal
highness
his
majesty
i
mean
with
a
grand
bow
to
the
little
child
who
laughed
innocently
back
again
and
i
will
do
my
humble
best
to
govern
the
country
still
if
the
country
has
the
slightest
objection
but
the
crown
prince
being
generalissimo
and
having
the
whole
army
at
his
beck
and
call
so
that
he
could
have
begun
a
civil
war
in
no
time
the
country
had
of
course
not
the
slightest
objection
so
the
king
and
queen
slept
together
in
peace
and
prince
dolor
reigned
over
the
land
that
is
his
uncle
did
and
everybody
said
what
a
fortunate
thing
it
was
for
the
poor
little
prince
to
have
such
a
clever
uncle
to
take
care
of
him
all
things
went
on
as
usual
indeed
after
the
regent
had
brought
his
wife
and
her
seven
sons
and
established
them
in
the
palace
rather
better
than
usual
for
they
gave
such
splendid
entertainments
and
made
the
capital
so
lively
that
trade
revived
and
the
country
was
said
to
be
more
flourishing
than
it
had
been
for
a
century
whenever
the
regent
and
his
sons
appeared
they
were
received
with
shouts
long
live
the
crown
prince
long
live
the
royal
family
and
in
truth
they
were
very
fine
children
the
whole
seven
of
them
and
made
a
great
show
when
they
rode
out
together
on
seven
beautiful
horses
one
height
above
another
down
to
the
youngest
on
his
tiny
black
pony
no
bigger
than
a
large
dog
illustration
in
truth
they
were
very
fine
children
the
whole
seven
of
illustration
made
a
great
show
when
they
rode
out
together
on
seven
beautiful
as
for
the
other
child
his
royal
highness
prince
dolor
for
somehow
people
soon
ceased
to
call
him
his
majesty
which
seemed
such
a
ridiculous
title
for
a
poor
little
fellow
a
helpless
cripple
with
only
head
and
trunk
and
no
legs
to
speak
of
he
was
seen
very
seldom
by
anybody
sometimes
people
daring
enough
to
peer
over
the
high
wall
of
the
palace
garden
noticed
there
carried
in
a
footman
arms
or
drawn
in
a
chair
or
left
to
play
on
the
grass
often
with
nobody
to
mind
him
a
pretty
little
boy
with
a
bright
intelligent
face
and
large
melancholy
eyes
no
not
exactly
melancholy
for
they
were
his
mother
and
she
was
by
no
means
but
thoughtful
and
dreamy
they
rather
perplexed
people
those
childish
eyes
they
were
so
exceedingly
innocent
and
yet
so
penetrating
if
anybody
did
a
wrong
thing
told
a
lie
for
instance
they
would
turn
round
with
such
a
grave
silent
surprise
the
child
never
talked
much
that
every
naughty
person
in
the
palace
was
rather
afraid
of
prince
dolor
he
could
not
help
it
and
perhaps
he
did
not
even
know
it
being
no
better
a
child
than
many
other
children
but
there
was
something
about
him
which
made
bad
people
sorry
and
grumbling
people
ashamed
of
themselves
and
people
gentle
and
kind
i
suppose
because
they
were
touched
to
see
a
poor
little
fellow
who
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
had
befallen
him
or
what
lay
before
him
living
his
baby
life
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
thus
whether
or
not
he
was
good
himself
the
sight
of
him
and
his
affliction
made
other
people
good
and
above
all
made
everybody
love
him
so
much
so
that
his
uncle
the
regent
began
to
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
now
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
uncles
in
general
they
are
usually
very
excellent
people
and
very
convenient
to
little
boys
and
girls
even
the
cruel
uncle
of
the
babes
in
the
wood
i
believe
to
be
quite
an
exceptional
character
and
this
cruel
uncle
of
whom
i
am
telling
was
i
hope
an
exception
too
he
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
if
anybody
had
called
him
so
he
would
have
resented
it
extremely
he
would
have
said
that
what
he
did
was
done
entirely
for
the
good
of
the
country
but
he
was
a
man
who
had
been
always
accustomed
to
consider
himself
first
and
foremost
believing
that
whatever
he
wanted
was
sure
to
be
right
and
therefore
he
ought
to
have
it
so
he
tried
to
get
it
and
got
it
too
as
people
like
him
very
often
do
whether
they
enjoy
it
when
they
have
it
is
another
question
therefore
he
went
one
day
to
the
determined
on
making
a
speech
and
informing
the
ministers
and
the
country
at
large
that
the
young
king
was
in
failing
health
and
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
send
him
for
a
time
to
the
beautiful
mountains
whether
he
really
meant
to
do
this
or
whether
it
occurred
to
him
afterwards
that
there
would
be
an
easier
way
of
attaining
his
great
desire
the
crown
of
nomansland
is
a
point
which
i
can
not
decide
but
soon
after
when
he
had
obtained
an
order
in
council
to
send
the
king
away
which
was
done
in
great
state
with
a
guard
of
honour
composed
of
two
whole
regiments
of
soldiers
the
nation
learnt
without
much
surprise
that
the
poor
little
prince
nobody
ever
called
him
king
now
had
gone
on
a
much
longer
journey
than
to
the
beautiful
mountains
he
had
fallen
ill
on
the
road
and
died
within
a
few
hours
at
least
so
declared
the
physician
in
attendance
and
the
nurse
who
had
been
sent
to
take
care
of
him
they
brought
his
coffin
back
in
great
state
and
buried
it
in
the
mausoleum
with
his
parents
so
prince
dolor
was
seen
no
more
the
country
went
into
deep
mourning
for
him
and
then
forgot
him
and
his
uncle
reigned
in
his
stead
that
illustrious
personage
accepted
his
crown
with
great
decorum
and
wore
it
with
great
dignity
to
the
last
but
whether
he
enjoyed
it
or
not
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
chapter
iii
and
what
of
the
little
lame
prince
whom
everybody
seemed
so
easily
to
have
forgotten
not
everybody
there
were
a
few
kind
souls
mothers
of
families
who
had
heard
his
sad
story
and
some
servants
about
the
palace
who
had
been
familiar
with
his
sweet
ways
these
many
a
time
sighed
and
said
poor
prince
dolor
or
looking
at
the
beautiful
mountains
which
were
visible
all
over
nomansland
though
few
people
ever
visited
them
well
perhaps
his
royal
highness
is
better
where
he
is
than
even
there
they
did
not
know
indeed
hardly
anybody
did
know
that
beyond
the
mountains
between
them
and
the
sea
lay
a
tract
of
country
barren
level
bare
except
for
short
stunted
grass
and
here
and
there
a
patch
of
tiny
flowers
not
a
bush
not
a
tree
not
a
for
bird
or
beast
was
in
that
dreary
plain
in
summer
the
sunshine
fell
upon
it
hour
after
hour
with
a
blinding
glare
in
winter
the
winds
and
rains
swept
over
it
unhindered
and
the
snow
came
down
steadily
noiselessly
covering
it
from
end
to
end
in
one
great
white
sheet
which
lay
for
days
and
weeks
unmarked
by
a
single
footprint
illustration
large
round
tower
which
rose
up
in
the
center
of
the
not
a
pleasant
place
to
live
in
and
nobody
did
live
there
apparently
the
only
sign
that
human
creatures
had
ever
been
near
the
spot
was
one
large
round
tower
which
rose
up
in
the
centre
of
the
plain
and
might
be
seen
all
over
it
if
there
had
been
anybody
to
see
which
there
never
was
rose
right
up
out
of
the
ground
as
if
it
had
grown
of
itself
like
a
mushroom
but
it
was
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
it
was
very
solidly
built
in
form
it
resembled
the
irish
round
towers
which
have
puzzled
people
for
so
long
nobody
being
able
to
find
out
when
or
by
whom
or
for
what
purpose
they
were
made
seemingly
for
no
use
at
all
like
this
tower
it
was
circular
of
very
firm
brickwork
with
neither
doors
nor
windows
until
near
the
top
when
you
could
perceive
some
slits
in
the
wall
through
which
one
might
possibly
creep
in
or
look
out
its
height
was
nearly
a
hundred
feet
high
and
it
had
a
battlemented
parapet
showing
sharp
against
the
sky
as
the
plain
was
quite
desolate
almost
like
a
desert
only
without
sand
and
led
to
nowhere
except
the
still
more
desolate
nobody
ever
crossed
it
whatever
mystery
there
was
about
the
tower
it
and
the
sky
and
the
plain
kept
their
secret
to
themselves
it
was
a
very
great
secret
indeed
a
state
secret
which
none
but
so
clever
a
man
as
the
present
king
of
nomansland
would
ever
have
thought
of
how
he
carried
it
out
undiscovered
i
can
not
tell
people
said
long
afterwards
that
it
was
by
means
of
a
gang
of
condemned
criminals
who
were
set
to
work
and
executed
immediately
after
they
had
done
so
that
nobody
knew
anything
or
in
the
least
suspected
the
real
fact
and
what
was
the
fact
why
that
this
tower
which
seemed
a
mere
mass
of
masonry
utterly
forsaken
and
uninhabited
was
not
so
at
all
within
twenty
feet
of
the
top
some
ingenious
architect
had
planned
a
perfect
little
house
divided
into
four
rooms
as
by
drawing
a
cross
within
a
circle
you
will
see
might
easily
be
done
by
making
skylights
and
a
few
slits
in
the
walls
for
windows
and
raising
a
peaked
roof
which
was
hidden
by
the
parapet
here
was
a
dwelling
complete
eighty
feet
from
the
ground
and
as
inaccessible
as
a
rook
nest
on
the
top
of
a
tree
a
charming
place
to
live
in
if
you
once
got
up
there
and
never
wanted
to
come
down
again
inside
though
nobody
could
have
looked
inside
except
a
bird
and
hardly
even
a
bird
flew
past
that
lonely
tower
inside
it
was
furnished
with
all
the
comfort
and
elegance
imaginable
with
lots
of
books
and
toys
and
everything
that
the
heart
of
a
child
could
desire
for
its
only
inhabitant
except
a
nurse
of
course
was
a
poor
little
solitary
child
one
winter
night
when
all
the
plain
was
white
with
moonlight
there
was
seen
crossing
it
a
great
tall
black
horse
ridden
by
a
man
also
big
and
equally
black
carrying
before
him
on
the
saddle
a
woman
and
a
child
the
woman
she
had
a
sad
fierce
look
and
no
wonder
for
she
was
a
criminal
under
sentence
of
death
but
her
sentence
had
been
changed
to
almost
as
severe
a
punishment
she
was
to
inhabit
the
lonely
tower
with
the
child
and
was
allowed
to
live
as
long
as
the
child
lived
no
longer
this
in
order
that
she
might
take
the
utmost
care
of
him
for
those
who
put
him
there
were
equally
afraid
of
his
dying
and
of
his
living
and
yet
he
was
only
a
little
gentle
boy
with
a
sweet
sleepy
smile
he
had
been
very
tired
with
his
long
journey
and
clinging
arms
which
held
tight
to
the
man
neck
for
he
was
rather
frightened
and
the
face
black
as
it
was
looked
kindly
at
him
and
he
was
very
helpless
with
his
poor
small
shrivelled
legs
which
could
neither
stand
nor
run
away
for
the
little
forlorn
boy
was
prince
dolor
illustration
was
rather
frightened
and
the
face
black
as
it
was
looked
kindly
at
he
had
not
been
dead
at
all
or
buried
either
his
grand
funeral
had
been
a
mere
pretence
a
wax
figure
having
been
put
in
his
place
while
he
himself
was
spirited
away
under
charge
of
these
two
the
condemned
woman
and
the
black
man
the
latter
was
deaf
and
dumb
so
could
neither
tell
nor
repeat
anything
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
tower
there
was
light
enough
to
see
a
huge
chain
dangling
from
the
parapet
but
dangling
only
half
way
the
took
from
his
a
sort
of
ladder
arranged
in
pieces
like
a
puzzle
fitted
it
together
and
lifted
it
up
to
meet
the
chain
then
he
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
slung
from
it
a
sort
of
chair
in
which
the
woman
and
the
child
placed
themselves
and
were
drawn
up
never
to
come
down
again
as
long
as
they
lived
leaving
them
there
the
man
descended
the
ladder
took
it
to
pieces
again
and
packed
it
in
his
pack
mounted
the
horse
and
disappeared
across
the
plain
every
month
they
used
to
watch
for
him
appearing
like
a
speck
in
the
distance
he
fastened
his
horse
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
and
climbed
it
as
before
laden
with
provisions
and
many
other
things
he
always
saw
the
prince
so
as
to
make
sure
that
the
child
was
alive
and
well
and
then
went
away
until
the
following
month
while
his
first
childhood
lasted
prince
dolor
was
happy
enough
he
had
every
luxury
that
even
a
prince
could
need
and
the
one
thing
wanting
love
never
having
known
he
did
not
miss
his
nurse
was
very
kind
to
him
though
she
was
a
wicked
woman
but
either
she
had
not
been
quite
so
wicked
as
people
said
or
she
grew
better
through
being
shut
up
continually
with
a
little
innocent
child
who
was
dependent
upon
her
for
every
comfort
and
pleasure
of
his
life
it
was
not
an
unhappy
life
there
was
nobody
to
tease
or
him
and
he
was
never
ill
he
played
about
from
room
to
room
there
were
four
rooms
parlour
kitchen
his
nurse
and
his
own
learnt
to
crawl
like
a
fly
and
to
jump
like
a
frog
and
to
run
about
on
almost
as
fast
as
a
puppy
in
fact
he
was
very
much
like
a
puppy
or
a
kitten
as
thoughtless
and
as
merry
scarcely
ever
cross
though
sometimes
a
little
weary
as
he
grew
older
he
occasionally
liked
to
be
quiet
for
awhile
and
then
he
would
sit
at
the
slits
of
windows
which
were
however
much
bigger
than
they
looked
from
the
bottom
of
the
tower
and
watch
the
sky
above
and
the
ground
below
with
the
storms
sweeping
over
and
the
sunshine
coming
and
going
and
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
running
races
across
the
blank
plain
he
began
to
learn
lessons
not
that
his
nurse
had
been
ordered
to
teach
him
but
she
did
it
partly
to
amuse
herself
she
was
not
a
stupid
woman
and
prince
dolor
was
by
no
means
a
stupid
boy
so
they
got
on
very
well
and
his
continual
entreaty
what
can
i
do
what
can
you
find
me
to
do
was
stopped
at
least
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
day
it
was
a
dull
life
but
he
had
never
known
any
other
anyhow
he
remembered
no
other
and
he
did
not
pity
himself
at
all
not
for
a
long
time
till
he
grew
to
be
quite
a
big
little
boy
and
could
read
easily
then
he
suddenly
took
to
books
which
the
brought
him
from
time
to
time
books
which
not
being
acquainted
with
the
literature
of
nomansland
i
can
not
describe
but
no
doubt
they
were
very
interesting
and
they
informed
him
of
everything
in
the
outside
world
and
filled
him
with
an
intense
longing
to
see
it
from
this
time
a
change
came
over
the
boy
he
began
to
look
sad
and
thin
and
to
shut
himself
up
for
hours
without
speaking
for
his
nurse
hardly
spoke
and
whatever
questions
he
asked
beyond
their
ordinary
daily
life
she
never
answered
she
had
indeed
been
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
to
tell
him
anything
about
himself
who
he
was
or
what
he
might
have
been
he
knew
he
was
prince
dolor
because
she
always
addressed
him
as
my
prince
and
your
royal
highness
but
what
a
prince
was
he
had
not
the
least
idea
he
had
no
idea
of
any
thing
in
the
world
except
what
he
found
in
his
books
he
sat
one
day
surrounded
by
them
having
built
them
up
round
him
like
a
little
castle
wall
he
had
been
reading
them
half
the
day
but
feeling
all
the
while
that
to
read
about
things
which
you
never
can
see
is
like
hearing
about
a
beautiful
dinner
while
you
are
starving
for
almost
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
grew
melancholy
his
hands
fell
on
his
lap
he
sat
gazing
out
of
the
upon
the
view
outside
the
view
he
had
looked
at
every
day
of
his
life
and
might
look
at
for
endless
days
more
not
a
very
cheerful
view
just
the
plain
and
the
sky
but
he
liked
it
he
used
to
think
if
he
could
only
fly
out
of
that
window
up
to
the
sky
or
down
to
the
plain
how
nice
it
would
be
perhaps
when
he
died
his
nurse
had
told
him
once
in
anger
that
he
would
never
leave
the
tower
till
he
died
he
might
be
able
to
do
this
not
that
he
understood
much
what
dying
meant
but
it
must
be
a
change
and
any
change
seemed
to
him
a
blessing
and
i
wish
i
had
somebody
to
tell
me
all
about
it
about
that
and
many
other
things
somebody
that
would
be
fond
of
me
like
my
poor
white
kitten
here
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
for
the
boy
one
friend
the
one
interest
of
his
life
had
been
a
little
white
kitten
which
the
kindly
smiling
once
took
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
him
the
only
living
creature
prince
dolor
had
ever
seen
for
four
weeks
it
was
his
constant
plaything
and
companion
till
one
moonlight
night
it
took
a
fancy
for
wandering
climbed
on
to
the
parapet
of
the
tower
dropped
over
and
disappeared
it
was
not
killed
he
hoped
for
cats
have
nine
lives
indeed
he
almost
fancied
he
saw
it
pick
itself
up
and
scamper
away
but
he
never
caught
sight
of
it
more
yes
i
wish
i
had
something
better
than
a
kitten
a
person
a
real
live
person
who
would
be
fond
of
me
and
kind
to
me
oh
i
want
somebody
dreadfully
dreadfully
as
he
spoke
there
sounded
behind
him
a
slight
as
of
a
stick
or
a
cane
and
twisting
himself
round
he
saw
what
do
you
think
he
saw
nothing
either
frightening
or
ugly
but
still
exceedingly
curious
a
little
woman
no
bigger
than
he
might
himself
have
been
had
his
legs
grown
like
those
of
other
children
but
she
was
not
a
child
she
was
an
old
woman
her
hair
was
grey
and
her
dress
was
grey
and
there
was
a
grey
shadow
over
her
whereever
she
moved
but
she
had
the
sweetest
smile
the
prettiest
hands
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
the
softest
voice
imaginable
my
dear
little
boy
and
dropping
her
cane
the
only
bright
and
rich
thing
about
her
she
laid
those
two
tiny
hands
on
his
shoulders
my
own
little
boy
i
could
not
come
to
you
until
you
had
said
you
wanted
me
but
now
you
do
want
me
here
i
am
illustration
laid
those
two
tiny
hands
on
his
shoulders
own
little
boy
i
could
not
come
to
you
until
you
had
said
you
wanted
me
and
you
are
very
welcome
madam
replied
the
prince
trying
to
speak
politely
as
princes
always
did
in
books
and
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
may
i
ask
who
you
are
perhaps
my
mother
for
he
knew
that
little
boys
usually
had
a
mother
and
had
occasionally
wondered
what
had
become
of
his
own
no
said
the
visitor
with
a
tender
smile
putting
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
and
looking
right
into
his
eyes
no
i
am
not
your
mother
though
she
was
a
dear
friend
of
mine
and
you
are
as
like
her
as
ever
you
can
be
will
you
tell
her
to
come
and
see
me
then
she
can
not
but
i
dare
say
she
knows
all
about
you
and
she
loves
you
very
much
and
so
do
i
and
i
want
to
help
you
all
i
can
my
poor
little
boy
why
do
you
call
me
poor
asked
prince
dolor
in
surprise
the
little
old
woman
glanced
down
on
his
legs
and
feet
which
he
did
not
know
were
different
from
those
of
other
children
and
then
at
his
sweet
bright
face
which
though
he
knew
not
that
either
was
exceedingly
different
from
many
children
faces
which
are
often
so
fretful
cross
sullen
looking
at
him
instead
of
sighing
she
smiled
i
beg
your
pardon
my
prince
said
she
yes
i
am
a
prince
and
my
name
is
dolor
will
you
tell
me
yours
madam
the
little
old
woman
laughed
like
a
chime
of
silver
bells
i
have
not
got
a
name
or
rather
i
have
so
many
names
that
i
know
which
to
choose
however
it
was
i
who
gave
you
yours
and
you
will
belong
to
me
all
your
days
i
am
your
godmother
hurrah
cried
the
little
prince
i
am
glad
i
belong
to
you
for
i
like
you
very
much
will
you
come
and
play
with
me
so
they
sat
down
together
and
played
they
began
to
talk
are
you
very
dull
here
asked
the
little
old
woman
not
particularly
thank
you
godmother
i
have
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
my
lessons
to
do
and
my
books
to
read
lots
of
books
and
you
want
nothing
nothing
yes
perhaps
if
you
please
godmother
could
you
bring
me
just
one
more
thing
what
sort
of
thing
a
little
boy
to
play
with
the
old
woman
looked
very
sad
just
the
thing
alas
which
i
can
not
give
you
my
child
i
can
not
alter
your
lot
in
any
way
but
i
can
help
you
to
bear
it
thank
you
but
why
do
you
talk
of
bearing
it
i
have
nothing
to
bear
my
poor
little
man
said
the
old
woman
in
the
very
tenderest
tone
of
her
tender
voice
kiss
me
what
is
kissing
asked
the
wondering
child
his
godmother
took
him
in
her
arms
and
embraced
him
many
times
he
kissed
her
back
again
at
first
awkwardly
and
shyly
then
with
all
the
strength
of
his
warm
little
heart
you
are
better
to
cuddle
than
even
my
white
kitten
i
think
promise
me
that
you
will
never
go
away
i
must
but
i
will
leave
a
present
behind
me
something
as
good
as
myself
to
amuse
you
something
that
will
take
you
wherever
you
want
to
go
and
show
you
all
that
you
wish
to
see
what
is
it
a
the
prince
countenance
fell
i
do
want
a
cloak
for
i
never
go
out
sometimes
nurse
hoists
me
on
to
the
roof
and
carries
me
round
by
the
parapet
but
that
is
all
i
ca
walk
you
know
as
she
does
the
more
reason
why
you
should
ride
and
besides
this
hush
she
coming
there
sounded
outside
the
room
door
a
heavy
step
and
a
grumpy
voice
and
a
rattle
of
plates
and
dishes
it
my
nurse
and
she
is
bringing
my
dinner
but
i
do
want
dinner
at
all
i
only
want
you
will
her
coming
drive
you
away
godmother
perhaps
but
only
for
a
little
never
mind
all
the
bolts
and
bars
in
the
world
could
keep
me
out
i
fly
in
at
the
window
or
down
through
the
chimney
only
wish
for
me
and
i
come
thank
you
said
prince
dolor
but
almost
in
a
whisper
for
he
was
very
uneasy
at
what
might
happen
next
his
nurse
and
his
godmother
what
would
they
say
to
one
another
how
would
they
look
at
one
another
two
such
different
faces
one
sullen
cross
and
sad
the
other
sweet
and
bright
and
calm
as
a
summer
evening
before
the
dark
begins
when
the
door
was
flung
open
prince
dolor
shut
his
eyes
trembling
all
over
opening
them
again
he
saw
he
need
fear
nothing
his
lovely
old
godmother
had
melted
away
just
like
the
rainbow
out
of
the
sky
as
he
had
watched
it
many
a
time
nobody
but
his
nurse
was
in
the
room
what
a
muddle
your
royal
highness
is
sitting
in
said
she
sharply
such
a
heap
of
untidy
books
and
what
this
rubbish
kicking
a
little
bundle
that
lay
beside
them
oh
nothing
nothing
give
it
me
cried
the
prince
and
darting
after
it
he
hid
it
under
his
pinafore
and
then
pushed
it
quickly
into
his
pocket
rubbish
as
it
was
it
was
left
in
the
place
where
she
had
sat
and
might
be
something
belonging
to
her
his
dear
kind
godmother
whom
already
he
loved
with
all
his
lonely
tender
passionate
heart
it
was
though
he
did
not
know
this
his
wonderful
chapter
iv
and
what
of
the
what
sort
of
cloak
was
it
and
what
good
did
it
do
the
prince
stay
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
outside
it
was
the
bundle
imaginable
shabby
and
small
and
the
instant
prince
dolor
touched
it
it
grew
smaller
still
dwindling
down
till
he
could
put
it
in
his
trousers
pocket
like
a
handkerchief
rolled
up
into
a
ball
he
did
this
at
once
for
fear
his
nurse
should
see
it
and
kept
it
there
all
day
all
night
too
till
after
his
next
morning
lessons
he
had
no
opportunity
of
examining
his
treasure
when
he
did
it
seemed
no
treasure
at
all
but
a
mere
piece
of
cloth
circular
in
form
dark
green
in
colour
that
is
if
it
had
any
colour
at
all
being
so
worn
and
shabby
though
not
dirty
it
had
a
split
cut
to
the
centre
forming
a
round
hole
for
the
neck
and
that
was
all
its
shape
the
shape
in
fact
of
those
cloaks
which
in
south
america
are
called
very
simple
but
most
graceful
and
convenient
prince
dolor
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
in
spite
of
his
disappointment
he
examined
it
curiously
spread
it
out
on
the
floor
then
arranged
it
on
his
shoulders
it
felt
very
warm
and
comfortable
but
it
was
so
exceedingly
shabby
the
only
shabby
thing
that
the
prince
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
illustration
dolor
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
in
spite
of
his
disappointment
he
examined
it
and
what
use
will
it
be
to
me
said
he
sadly
i
have
no
need
of
outdoor
clothes
as
i
never
go
out
why
was
this
given
me
i
wonder
and
what
in
the
world
am
i
to
do
with
it
she
must
be
a
rather
funny
person
this
dear
godmother
of
mine
nevertheless
because
she
was
his
godmother
and
had
given
him
the
cloak
he
folded
it
carefully
and
put
it
away
poor
and
shabby
as
it
was
hiding
it
in
a
safe
corner
of
his
which
his
nurse
never
meddled
with
he
did
not
want
her
to
find
it
or
to
laugh
at
it
or
at
his
godmother
as
he
felt
sure
she
would
if
she
knew
all
there
it
lay
and
he
forgot
all
about
it
nay
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
being
but
a
child
and
not
seeing
her
again
he
almost
forgot
his
sweet
old
godmother
or
thought
of
her
only
as
he
did
of
the
angels
or
fairies
that
he
read
of
in
his
books
and
of
her
visit
as
if
it
had
been
a
mere
dream
of
the
night
there
were
times
certainly
when
he
recalled
her
of
early
mornings
like
that
morning
when
she
appeared
beside
him
and
late
evenings
when
the
grey
twilight
reminded
him
of
the
colour
of
her
hair
and
her
pretty
soft
garments
above
all
when
waking
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
the
stars
peering
in
at
his
window
or
the
moonlight
shining
across
his
little
bed
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
her
standing
beside
it
looking
at
him
with
those
beautiful
tender
eyes
which
seemed
to
have
a
pleasantness
and
comfort
in
them
different
from
anything
he
had
ever
known
but
she
never
came
and
gradually
she
slipped
out
of
his
memory
only
a
boy
memory
after
all
until
something
happened
which
made
him
remember
her
and
want
her
as
he
had
never
wanted
anything
before
prince
dolor
fell
ill
he
caught
his
nurse
could
not
tell
how
a
complaint
common
to
the
people
of
nomansland
called
the
doldrums
as
unpleasant
as
measles
or
any
other
of
our
complaints
and
it
made
him
restless
cross
and
disagreeable
even
when
a
little
better
he
was
too
weak
to
enjoy
anything
but
lay
all
day
long
on
his
sofa
fidgetting
his
nurse
extremely
while
in
her
intense
terror
lest
he
might
die
she
fidgetted
him
still
more
at
last
seeing
he
really
was
getting
well
she
left
him
to
himself
which
he
was
most
glad
of
in
spite
of
his
dulness
and
dreariness
there
he
lay
alone
quite
alone
illustration
when
a
little
better
he
was
too
weak
to
enjoy
anything
but
lay
all
day
long
on
his
sofa
fidgetting
his
nurse
now
and
then
an
irritable
fit
came
over
him
in
which
he
longed
to
get
up
and
do
something
or
go
somewhere
would
have
liked
to
imitate
his
white
kitten
jump
down
from
the
tower
and
run
away
taking
the
chance
of
whatever
might
happen
only
one
thing
alas
was
likely
to
happen
for
the
kitten
he
remembered
had
four
active
legs
while
he
i
wonder
what
my
godmother
meant
when
she
looked
at
my
legs
and
sighed
so
bitterly
i
wonder
why
i
ca
walk
straight
and
steady
like
my
nurse
only
i
would
like
to
have
her
great
noisy
clumping
shoes
still
it
would
be
very
nice
to
move
about
quickly
perhaps
to
fly
like
a
bird
like
that
string
of
birds
i
saw
the
other
day
skimming
across
the
sky
one
after
the
other
these
were
the
the
only
living
creatures
that
ever
crossed
the
lonely
plain
and
he
had
been
much
interested
in
them
wondering
whence
they
came
and
whither
they
were
going
how
nice
it
must
be
to
be
a
bird
if
legs
are
no
good
why
can
not
one
have
wings
people
have
wings
when
they
die
perhaps
i
wish
i
was
dead
that
i
do
i
am
so
tired
so
tired
and
nobody
cares
for
me
nobody
ever
did
care
for
me
except
perhaps
my
godmother
godmother
dear
have
you
quite
forsaken
me
he
stretched
himself
wearily
gathered
himself
up
and
dropped
his
head
upon
his
hands
as
he
did
so
he
felt
somebody
kiss
him
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
turning
found
that
he
was
resting
not
on
the
but
on
a
warm
shoulder
that
of
the
little
old
woman
clothed
in
grey
how
glad
he
was
to
see
her
how
he
looked
into
her
kind
eyes
and
felt
her
hands
to
see
if
she
were
all
real
and
alive
then
put
both
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
as
if
he
would
never
have
done
kissing
stop
stop
cried
she
pretending
to
be
smothered
i
see
you
have
not
forgotten
my
teachings
kissing
is
a
good
thing
in
moderation
only
just
let
me
have
breath
to
speak
one
word
a
dozen
he
said
well
then
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
to
you
since
i
saw
you
or
rather
since
you
saw
me
which
is
a
quite
different
thing
nothing
has
happened
nothing
ever
does
happen
to
me
answered
the
prince
dolefully
and
are
you
very
dull
my
boy
so
dull
that
i
was
just
thinking
whether
i
could
not
jump
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
tower
like
my
white
kitten
do
do
that
being
not
a
white
kitten
i
wish
i
were
i
wish
i
were
anything
but
what
i
am
and
you
ca
make
yourself
any
different
nor
can
i
do
it
either
you
must
be
content
to
stay
just
what
you
are
the
little
old
woman
said
this
very
firmly
but
gently
too
with
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
her
lips
on
his
forehead
it
was
the
first
time
the
boy
had
ever
heard
any
one
talk
like
this
and
he
looked
up
in
surprise
but
not
in
pain
for
her
sweet
manner
softened
the
hardness
of
her
words
now
my
prince
for
you
are
a
prince
and
must
behave
as
such
let
us
see
what
we
can
do
how
much
i
can
do
for
you
or
show
you
how
to
do
for
yourself
where
is
your
prince
dolor
blushed
extremely
i
i
put
it
away
in
the
cupboard
i
suppose
it
is
there
still
you
have
never
used
it
you
dislike
it
he
hesitated
not
wishing
to
be
impolite
do
you
think
it
just
a
little
old
and
shabby
for
a
prince
the
old
woman
laughed
long
and
loud
though
very
sweetly
prince
indeed
why
if
all
the
princes
in
the
world
craved
for
it
they
could
get
it
unless
i
gave
it
them
old
and
shabby
it
the
most
valuable
thing
imaginable
very
few
ever
have
it
but
i
thought
i
would
give
it
to
you
because
because
you
are
different
from
other
people
am
i
said
the
prince
and
looked
first
with
curiosity
then
with
a
sort
of
anxiety
into
his
godmother
face
which
was
sad
and
grave
with
slow
tears
beginning
to
steal
down
she
touched
his
poor
little
legs
these
are
not
like
those
of
other
little
boys
indeed
my
nurse
never
told
me
that
very
likely
not
but
it
is
time
you
were
told
and
i
tell
you
because
i
love
you
tell
me
what
dear
godmother
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
walk
or
run
or
jump
or
play
that
your
life
will
be
quite
different
to
most
people
lives
but
it
may
be
a
very
happy
life
for
all
that
do
not
be
afraid
i
am
not
afraid
said
the
boy
but
he
turned
very
pale
and
his
lips
began
to
quiver
though
he
did
not
actually
cry
he
was
too
old
for
that
and
perhaps
too
proud
though
not
wholly
comprehending
he
began
dimly
to
guess
what
his
godmother
meant
he
had
never
seen
any
real
live
boys
but
he
had
seen
pictures
of
them
running
and
jumping
which
he
had
admired
and
tried
hard
to
imitate
but
always
failed
now
he
began
to
understand
why
he
failed
and
that
he
always
should
fail
that
in
fact
he
was
not
like
other
little
boys
and
it
was
of
no
use
his
wishing
to
do
as
they
did
and
play
as
they
played
even
if
he
had
had
them
to
play
with
his
was
a
separate
life
in
which
he
must
find
out
new
work
and
new
pleasures
for
himself
the
sense
of
as
people
call
it
that
we
can
not
have
things
as
we
want
them
to
be
but
as
they
are
and
that
we
must
learn
to
bear
them
and
make
the
best
of
them
this
lesson
which
everybody
has
to
learn
soon
or
late
came
alas
sadly
soon
to
the
poor
boy
he
fought
against
it
for
a
while
and
then
quite
overcome
turned
and
sobbed
bitterly
in
his
godmother
arms
she
comforted
him
i
do
not
know
how
except
that
love
always
comforts
and
then
she
whispered
to
him
in
her
sweet
strong
cheerful
voice
never
mind
no
i
do
think
i
do
mind
that
is
i
mind
replied
he
catching
the
courage
of
her
tone
and
speaking
like
a
man
though
he
was
still
such
a
mere
boy
that
is
right
my
prince
that
is
being
like
a
prince
now
we
know
exactly
where
we
are
let
us
put
our
shoulders
to
the
wheel
and
we
are
in
hopeless
tower
this
was
its
name
if
it
had
a
name
and
there
is
no
wheel
to
put
our
shoulders
to
said
the
child
sadly
you
little
goose
well
for
you
that
you
have
a
godmother
called
what
he
eagerly
asked
what
a
funny
name
some
people
give
it
me
but
they
are
not
my
most
intimate
friends
these
call
me
never
mind
what
added
the
old
woman
with
a
soft
twinkle
in
her
eyes
so
as
you
know
me
and
know
me
well
you
may
give
me
any
name
you
please
it
does
matter
but
i
am
your
godmother
child
i
have
few
godchildren
those
i
have
love
me
dearly
and
find
me
the
greatest
blessing
in
all
the
world
i
can
well
believe
it
cried
the
little
lame
prince
and
forgot
his
troubles
in
looking
at
her
as
her
figure
dilated
her
eyes
grew
lustrous
as
stars
her
very
raiment
brightened
and
the
whole
room
seemed
filled
with
her
beautiful
and
beneficent
presence
like
light
he
could
have
looked
at
her
for
ever
half
in
love
half
in
awe
but
she
suddenly
dwindled
down
into
the
little
old
woman
all
in
grey
and
with
a
malicious
twinkle
in
her
eyes
asked
for
the
bring
it
out
of
the
rubbish
cupboard
and
shake
the
dust
off
it
quick
said
she
to
prince
dolor
who
hung
his
head
rather
ashamed
spread
it
out
on
the
floor
and
wait
till
the
split
closes
and
the
edges
turn
up
like
a
rim
all
round
then
go
and
open
the
mind
i
say
the
set
yourself
down
in
the
middle
of
it
like
a
frog
on
a
leaf
say
dum
dum
dum
and
see
what
will
happen
the
prince
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughing
it
all
seemed
so
exceedingly
silly
he
wondered
that
a
wise
old
woman
like
his
godmother
should
talk
such
nonsense
you
mean
said
she
answering
to
his
great
alarm
his
unspoken
thoughts
did
i
not
tell
you
some
people
called
me
by
that
name
never
mind
it
does
harm
me
and
she
laughed
her
merry
laugh
as
as
if
she
were
the
prince
age
instead
of
her
own
whatever
that
might
be
she
certainly
was
a
most
extraordinary
old
woman
believe
me
or
not
it
does
matter
said
she
here
is
the
cloak
when
you
want
to
go
travelling
on
it
say
dum
dum
when
you
want
to
come
back
again
say
tum
tum
all
a
puff
of
pleasant
air
passing
by
him
and
making
him
feel
for
the
moment
quite
strong
and
well
was
all
the
prince
was
conscious
of
his
most
extraordinary
godmother
was
gone
really
now
how
rosy
your
royal
highness
cheeks
have
grown
you
seem
to
have
got
well
already
said
the
nurse
entering
the
room
i
think
i
have
replied
the
prince
very
gently
he
felt
kindly
and
gently
even
to
his
grim
nurse
and
now
let
me
have
my
dinner
and
go
you
to
your
sewing
as
usual
the
instant
she
was
gone
however
taking
with
her
the
plates
and
dishes
which
for
the
first
time
since
his
illness
he
had
satisfactorily
cleared
prince
dolor
sprang
down
from
his
sofa
and
with
one
or
two
of
his
jumps
not
graceful
but
convenient
he
reached
the
cupboard
where
he
kept
his
toys
and
looked
everywhere
for
his
alas
it
was
not
there
while
he
was
ill
of
the
doldrums
his
nurse
thinking
it
a
good
opportunity
for
putting
things
to
rights
had
made
a
grand
clearance
of
all
his
rubbish
as
she
considered
it
his
beloved
headless
horses
broken
carts
sheep
without
feet
and
birds
without
wings
all
the
treasures
of
his
baby
days
which
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
though
he
seldom
played
with
them
now
he
liked
just
to
feel
they
were
there
they
were
all
gone
and
with
them
the
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
looking
at
the
empty
shelves
so
beautifully
clean
and
tidy
then
burst
out
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
but
quietly
always
quietly
he
never
let
his
nurse
hear
him
cry
she
only
laughed
at
him
as
he
felt
she
would
laugh
now
and
it
is
all
my
own
fault
he
cried
i
ought
to
have
taken
better
care
of
my
godmother
gift
o
godmother
forgive
me
i
never
be
so
careless
again
i
do
know
what
the
cloak
is
exactly
but
i
am
sure
it
is
something
precious
help
me
to
find
it
again
oh
do
let
it
be
stolen
from
me
do
please
ha
ha
ha
laughed
a
silvery
voice
why
that
is
the
one
thing
in
the
world
which
nobody
can
steal
it
is
of
no
use
to
anybody
except
the
owner
open
your
eyes
my
prince
and
see
what
you
shall
see
his
dear
old
godmother
he
thought
had
turned
eagerly
round
but
no
he
only
beheld
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
room
all
dust
and
cobwebs
his
precious
prince
dolor
darted
towards
it
tumbling
several
times
on
the
way
as
he
often
did
tumble
poor
boy
and
pick
himself
up
again
never
complaining
snatching
it
to
his
breast
he
hugged
and
kissed
it
cobwebs
and
all
as
if
it
had
been
something
alive
then
he
began
unrolling
it
wondering
each
minute
what
would
happen
but
what
did
happen
was
so
curious
that
i
must
leave
it
for
another
chapter
chapter
if
any
reader
big
or
little
should
wonder
whether
there
is
a
meaning
in
this
story
deeper
than
that
of
an
ordinary
fairy
tale
i
will
own
that
there
is
but
i
have
hidden
it
so
carefully
that
the
smaller
people
and
many
larger
folk
will
never
find
it
out
and
meantime
the
book
may
be
read
straight
on
like
cinderella
or
or
thumb
for
what
interest
it
has
or
what
amusement
it
may
bring
having
said
this
i
return
to
prince
dolor
that
little
lame
boy
whom
many
may
think
so
exceedingly
to
be
pitied
but
if
you
had
seen
him
as
he
sat
patiently
untying
his
wonderful
cloak
which
was
done
up
in
a
very
tight
and
perplexing
parcel
using
skilfully
his
deft
little
hands
and
knitting
his
brows
with
firm
determination
while
his
eyes
glistened
with
pleasure
and
energy
and
eager
anticipation
if
you
had
beheld
him
thus
you
might
have
changed
your
opinion
when
we
see
people
suffering
or
unfortunate
we
feel
very
sorry
for
them
but
when
we
see
them
bravely
bearing
their
sufferings
and
making
the
best
of
their
misfortunes
it
is
quite
a
different
feeling
we
respect
we
admire
them
one
can
respect
and
admire
even
a
little
child
when
prince
dolor
had
patiently
untied
all
the
knots
a
remarkable
thing
happened
the
cloak
began
to
undo
itself
slowly
unfolding
it
laid
itself
down
on
the
carpet
as
flat
as
if
it
had
been
ironed
the
split
joined
with
a
little
sharp
and
the
rim
turned
up
all
round
till
it
was
for
meantime
the
cloak
had
grown
and
grown
and
become
quite
large
enough
for
one
person
to
sit
in
it
as
comfortable
as
if
in
a
boat
the
prince
watched
it
rather
anxiously
it
was
such
an
extraordinary
not
to
say
a
frightening
thing
however
he
was
no
coward
but
a
thorough
boy
who
if
he
had
been
like
other
boys
would
doubtless
have
grown
up
daring
and
adventurous
a
soldier
a
sailor
or
the
like
as
it
was
he
could
only
show
his
courage
morally
not
physically
by
being
afraid
of
nothing
and
by
doing
boldly
all
that
it
was
in
his
narrow
powers
to
do
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
in
this
way
he
showed
more
real
valour
than
if
he
had
had
six
pairs
of
proper
legs
he
said
to
himself
what
a
goose
i
am
as
if
my
dear
godmother
would
ever
have
given
me
anything
to
hurt
me
here
goes
so
with
one
of
his
active
leaps
he
sprang
right
into
the
middle
of
the
cloak
where
he
squatted
down
wrapping
his
arms
tight
round
his
knees
for
they
shook
a
little
and
his
heart
beat
fast
but
there
he
sat
steady
and
silent
waiting
for
what
might
happen
next
nothing
did
happen
and
he
began
to
think
nothing
would
and
to
feel
rather
disappointed
when
he
recollected
the
words
he
had
been
told
to
repeat
abracadabra
dum
dum
dum
he
repeated
them
laughing
all
the
while
they
seemed
such
nonsense
and
then
and
then
now
i
do
expect
anybody
to
believe
what
i
am
going
to
relate
though
a
good
many
wise
people
have
believed
a
good
many
sillier
things
and
as
seeing
believing
and
i
never
saw
it
i
can
not
be
expected
implicitly
to
believe
it
myself
except
in
a
sort
of
a
way
and
yet
there
is
truth
in
it
for
some
people
the
cloak
rose
slowly
and
steadily
at
first
only
a
few
inches
then
gradually
higher
and
higher
till
it
nearly
touched
the
skylight
prince
dolor
head
actually
bumped
against
the
glass
or
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
crouched
down
crying
oh
please
do
hurt
me
in
a
most
melancholy
voice
then
he
suddenly
remembered
his
godmother
express
command
open
the
skylight
regaining
his
courage
at
once
without
a
moment
delay
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
began
searching
for
the
bolt
the
cloak
meanwhile
remaining
perfectly
still
balanced
in
air
but
the
minute
the
window
was
opened
out
it
sailed
right
out
into
the
clear
fresh
air
with
nothing
between
it
and
the
cloudless
blue
prince
dolor
had
never
felt
any
such
delicious
sensation
before
i
can
understand
it
can
not
you
did
you
never
think
in
watching
the
rooks
going
home
singly
or
in
pairs
oaring
their
way
across
the
calm
evening
sky
till
they
vanish
like
black
dots
in
the
misty
grey
how
pleasant
it
must
feel
to
be
up
there
quite
out
of
the
noise
and
din
of
the
world
able
to
hear
and
see
everything
down
below
yet
troubled
by
nothing
and
teased
by
no
one
all
alone
but
perfectly
content
something
like
this
was
the
happiness
of
the
little
lame
prince
when
he
got
out
of
hopeless
tower
and
found
himself
for
the
first
time
in
the
pure
open
air
with
the
sky
above
him
and
the
earth
below
true
there
was
nothing
but
earth
and
sky
no
houses
no
trees
no
rivers
mountains
seas
not
a
beast
on
the
ground
or
a
bird
in
the
air
but
to
him
even
the
level
plain
looked
beautiful
and
then
there
was
the
glorious
arch
of
the
sky
with
a
little
young
moon
sitting
in
the
west
like
a
baby
queen
and
the
evening
breeze
was
so
sweet
and
fresh
it
kissed
him
like
his
godmother
kisses
and
a
few
stars
came
out
first
two
or
three
and
then
quantities
quantities
so
that
when
he
began
to
count
them
he
was
utterly
bewildered
illustration
a
few
stars
came
out
first
two
or
three
and
then
quantities
by
this
time
however
the
cool
breeze
had
become
cold
the
mist
gathered
and
as
he
had
as
he
said
no
outdoor
clothes
poor
prince
dolor
was
not
very
comfortable
the
dews
fell
damp
on
his
curls
he
began
to
shiver
perhaps
i
had
better
go
home
thought
he
but
how
for
in
his
excitement
the
other
words
which
his
godmother
had
told
him
to
use
had
slipped
his
memory
they
were
only
a
little
different
from
the
first
but
in
that
slight
difference
all
the
importance
lay
as
he
repeated
his
abracadabra
trying
ever
so
many
other
syllables
after
it
the
cloak
only
went
faster
and
faster
skimming
on
through
the
dusky
empty
air
the
poor
little
prince
began
to
feel
frightened
what
if
his
wonderful
should
keep
on
thus
travelling
perhaps
to
the
end
carrying
with
it
a
poor
tired
hungry
boy
who
after
all
was
beginning
to
think
there
was
something
very
pleasant
in
supper
and
bed
dear
godmother
he
cried
pitifully
do
help
me
tell
me
just
this
once
and
i
never
forget
again
instantly
the
words
came
rushing
into
his
head
abracadabra
tum
tum
ti
was
that
it
ah
yes
for
the
cloak
began
to
turn
slowly
he
repeated
the
charm
again
more
distinctly
and
firmly
when
it
gave
a
gentle
dip
like
a
nod
of
satisfaction
and
immediately
started
back
as
fast
as
ever
in
the
direction
of
the
tower
he
reached
the
skylight
which
he
found
exactly
as
he
had
left
it
and
slipped
in
cloak
and
all
as
easily
as
he
had
got
out
he
had
scarcely
reached
the
floor
and
was
still
sitting
in
the
middle
of
his
like
a
frog
on
a
leaf
as
his
godmother
had
expressed
it
when
he
heard
his
nurse
voice
outside
bless
us
what
has
become
of
your
royal
highness
all
this
time
to
sit
stupidly
here
at
the
window
till
it
is
quite
dark
and
leave
the
skylight
open
too
prince
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
you
are
the
silliest
boy
i
ever
knew
am
i
said
he
absently
and
never
heeding
her
crossness
or
his
only
anxiety
was
lest
she
might
find
out
anything
she
would
have
been
a
very
clever
person
to
have
done
so
the
instant
prince
dolor
got
off
it
the
cloak
folded
itself
up
into
the
tiniest
possible
parcel
tied
all
its
own
knots
and
rolled
itself
of
its
own
accord
into
the
farthest
and
darkest
corner
of
the
room
if
the
nurse
had
seen
it
which
she
did
she
would
have
taken
it
for
a
mere
bundle
of
rubbish
not
worth
noticing
shutting
the
skylight
with
an
angry
bang
she
brought
in
the
supper
and
lit
the
candles
with
her
usual
unhappy
expression
of
countenance
but
prince
dolor
hardly
saw
it
he
only
saw
hid
in
the
corner
where
nobody
else
would
see
it
his
wonderful
and
though
his
supper
was
not
particularly
nice
he
ate
it
heartily
scarcely
hearing
a
word
of
his
nurse
grumbling
which
seemed
to
have
taken
the
place
of
her
sullen
silence
illustration
brought
in
the
supper
and
lit
the
candles
with
her
usual
unhappy
expression
he
only
saw
his
wonderful
poor
woman
he
thought
when
he
paused
a
minute
to
listen
and
look
at
her
with
those
quiet
happy
eyes
so
like
his
mother
poor
woman
has
got
a
and
when
he
was
left
alone
at
last
and
crept
into
his
little
bed
where
he
lay
awake
a
good
while
watching
what
he
called
his
all
planted
with
stars
like
flowers
his
chief
thought
was
i
must
be
up
very
early
morning
and
get
my
lessons
done
and
then
i
go
travelling
all
over
the
world
on
my
beautiful
cloak
so
next
day
he
opened
his
eyes
with
the
sun
and
went
with
a
good
heart
to
his
lessons
they
had
hitherto
been
the
chief
amusement
of
his
dull
life
now
i
am
afraid
he
found
them
also
a
little
dull
but
he
tried
to
be
good
i
do
say
prince
dolor
always
was
good
but
he
generally
tried
to
be
and
when
his
mind
went
wandering
after
the
dark
dusty
corner
where
lay
his
precious
treasure
he
resolutely
called
it
back
again
for
he
said
how
ashamed
my
godmother
would
be
of
me
if
i
grew
up
a
stupid
boy
but
the
instant
lessons
were
done
and
he
was
alone
in
the
empty
room
he
crept
across
the
floor
undid
the
shabby
little
bundle
his
fingers
trembling
with
eagerness
climbed
on
the
chair
and
thence
to
the
table
so
as
to
unbar
the
skylight
he
forgot
nothing
now
said
his
magic
charm
and
was
away
out
of
the
window
as
children
say
in
a
few
minutes
less
than
no
time
nobody
missed
him
he
was
accustomed
to
sit
so
quietly
always
that
his
nurse
though
only
in
the
next
room
perceived
no
difference
and
besides
she
might
have
gone
in
and
out
a
dozen
times
and
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
she
never
could
have
found
out
his
absence
for
what
do
you
think
the
clever
godmother
did
she
took
a
quantity
of
moonshine
or
some
equally
convenient
material
and
made
an
image
which
she
set
on
the
reading
or
by
the
table
drawing
where
it
looked
so
like
prince
dolor
that
any
common
observer
would
never
have
guessed
the
deception
and
even
the
boy
would
have
been
puzzled
to
know
which
was
the
image
and
which
was
himself
and
all
this
while
the
happy
little
fellow
was
away
floating
in
the
air
on
his
magic
cloak
and
seeing
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
or
they
seemed
wonderful
to
him
who
had
hitherto
seen
nothing
at
all
first
there
were
the
flowers
that
grew
on
the
plain
which
whenever
the
cloak
came
near
enough
he
strained
his
eyes
to
look
at
they
were
very
tiny
but
very
beautiful
white
saxifrage
and
yellow
lotus
and
purple
and
bright
with
many
others
the
names
of
which
i
do
not
know
no
more
did
prince
dolor
though
he
tried
to
find
them
out
by
recalling
any
pictures
he
had
seen
of
them
but
he
was
too
far
off
and
though
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
admire
them
as
brilliant
patches
of
colour
still
he
would
have
liked
to
examine
them
all
he
was
as
a
little
girl
i
know
once
said
of
a
playfellow
a
very
boy
i
wonder
he
thought
whether
i
could
see
better
through
a
pair
of
glasses
like
those
my
nurse
reads
with
and
takes
such
care
of
how
i
would
take
care
of
them
too
if
only
i
had
a
pair
immediately
he
felt
something
queer
and
hard
fixing
itself
on
to
the
bridge
of
his
nose
it
was
a
pair
of
the
prettiest
gold
spectacles
ever
seen
and
looking
downwards
he
found
that
though
ever
so
high
above
the
ground
he
could
see
every
minute
blade
of
grass
every
tiny
bud
and
flower
nay
even
the
insects
that
walked
over
them
thank
you
thank
you
he
cried
in
a
gush
of
gratitude
to
anybody
or
everybody
but
especially
to
his
dear
godmother
whom
he
felt
sure
had
given
him
this
new
present
he
amused
himself
with
it
for
ever
so
long
with
his
chin
pressed
on
the
rim
of
the
cloak
gazing
down
upon
the
grass
every
square
foot
of
which
was
a
mine
of
wonders
then
just
to
rest
his
eyes
he
turned
them
up
to
the
sky
the
blue
bright
empty
sky
which
he
had
looked
at
so
often
and
seen
nothing
now
surely
there
was
something
a
long
black
wavy
line
moving
on
in
the
distance
not
by
chance
as
the
clouds
move
apparently
but
deliberately
as
if
it
were
alive
he
might
have
seen
it
before
he
almost
thought
he
had
but
then
he
could
not
tell
what
it
was
looking
at
it
through
his
spectacles
he
discovered
that
it
really
was
alive
being
a
long
string
of
birds
flying
one
after
the
other
their
wings
moving
steadily
and
their
heads
pointed
in
one
direction
as
steadily
as
if
each
were
a
little
ship
guided
invisibly
by
an
unerring
helm
they
must
be
the
flying
seawards
cried
the
boy
who
had
read
a
little
about
them
and
had
a
great
talent
for
putting
two
and
two
together
and
finding
out
all
he
could
oh
how
i
should
like
to
see
them
quite
close
and
to
know
where
they
come
from
and
whither
they
are
going
how
i
wish
i
knew
everything
in
all
the
world
a
silly
speech
for
even
an
examining
little
boy
to
make
because
as
we
grow
older
the
more
we
know
the
more
we
find
out
there
is
to
know
and
prince
dolor
blushed
when
he
had
said
it
and
hoped
nobody
had
heard
him
apparently
somebody
had
however
for
the
cloak
gave
a
sudden
bound
forward
and
presently
he
found
himself
high
up
in
air
in
the
very
middle
of
that
band
of
ærial
travellers
who
had
no
magic
cloak
to
travel
on
nothing
except
their
wings
yet
there
they
were
making
their
fearless
way
through
the
sky
prince
dolor
looked
at
them
as
one
after
the
other
they
glided
past
him
and
they
looked
at
him
those
pretty
swallows
with
their
changing
necks
and
bright
eyes
as
if
wondering
to
meet
in
such
an
extraordinary
sort
of
a
bird
illustration
looked
at
him
as
if
wondering
to
meet
in
such
an
extraordinary
sort
of
oh
i
wish
i
were
going
with
you
you
lovely
creatures
cried
the
boy
i
getting
so
tired
of
this
dull
plain
and
the
dreary
and
lonely
tower
i
do
so
want
to
see
the
world
pretty
swallows
dear
swallows
tell
me
what
it
looks
like
the
beautiful
wonderful
world
but
the
swallows
flew
past
him
steadily
slowly
pursuing
their
course
as
if
inside
each
little
head
had
been
a
mariner
compass
to
guide
them
safe
over
land
and
sea
direct
to
the
place
where
they
desired
to
go
the
boy
looked
after
them
with
envy
for
a
long
time
he
followed
with
his
eyes
the
faint
wavy
black
line
as
it
floated
away
sometimes
changing
its
curves
a
little
but
never
deviating
from
its
settled
course
till
it
vanished
entirely
out
of
sight
then
he
settled
himself
down
in
the
centre
of
the
cloak
feeling
quite
sad
and
lonely
i
think
i
go
home
said
he
and
repeated
his
abracadabra
tum
tum
ti
with
a
rather
heavy
heart
the
more
he
had
the
more
he
wanted
and
it
is
not
always
one
can
have
everything
one
wants
at
least
at
the
exact
minute
one
craves
for
it
not
even
though
one
is
a
prince
and
has
a
powerful
and
beneficent
godmother
he
did
not
like
to
vex
her
by
calling
for
her
and
telling
her
how
unhappy
he
was
in
spite
of
all
her
goodness
so
he
just
kept
his
trouble
to
himself
went
back
to
his
lonely
tower
and
spent
three
days
in
silent
melancholy
without
even
attempting
another
journey
on
his
chapter
vi
the
fourth
day
it
happened
that
the
paid
his
accustomed
visit
after
which
prince
dolor
spirits
rose
they
always
did
when
he
got
the
new
books
which
just
to
relieve
his
conscience
the
king
of
nomansland
regularly
sent
to
his
nephew
with
many
new
toys
also
though
the
latter
were
disregarded
now
toys
indeed
when
i
a
big
boy
said
the
prince
with
disdain
and
would
scarcely
condescend
to
mount
a
which
had
come
somehow
or
other
i
ca
be
expected
to
explain
things
very
exactly
packed
on
the
back
of
the
other
the
great
black
horse
which
stood
and
fed
contentedly
at
the
bottom
of
the
tower
prince
dolor
leaned
over
and
looked
at
it
and
thought
how
grand
it
must
be
to
get
upon
its
back
this
grand
live
steed
and
ride
away
like
the
pictures
of
knights
suppose
i
was
a
knight
he
said
to
himself
then
i
should
be
obliged
to
ride
out
and
see
the
world
but
he
kept
all
these
thoughts
to
himself
and
just
sat
still
devouring
his
new
books
till
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
them
all
it
was
a
repast
not
unlike
the
barmecide
feast
which
you
read
of
in
the
arabian
nights
which
consisted
of
very
elegant
but
empty
dishes
or
that
supper
of
sancho
panza
in
don
quixote
where
the
minute
the
smoking
dishes
came
on
the
table
the
physician
waved
his
hand
and
they
were
all
taken
away
thus
almost
all
the
ordinary
delights
of
had
been
taken
away
from
or
rather
never
given
to
this
poor
little
prince
i
wonder
he
would
sometimes
think
i
wonder
what
it
feels
like
to
be
on
the
back
of
a
horse
galloping
away
or
holding
the
reins
in
a
carriage
and
tearing
across
the
country
or
jumping
a
ditch
or
running
a
race
such
as
i
read
of
or
see
in
pictures
what
a
lot
of
things
there
are
that
i
should
like
to
do
but
first
i
should
like
to
go
and
see
the
world
i
try
apparently
it
was
his
godmother
plan
always
to
let
him
try
and
try
hard
before
he
gained
anything
this
day
the
knots
that
tied
up
his
were
more
than
usually
troublesome
and
he
was
a
full
half
hour
before
he
got
out
into
the
open
air
and
found
himself
floating
merrily
over
the
top
of
the
tower
hitherto
in
all
his
journeys
he
had
never
let
himself
go
out
of
sight
of
home
for
the
dreary
building
after
all
was
home
he
remembered
no
other
but
now
he
felt
sick
of
the
very
look
of
his
tower
with
its
round
smooth
walls
and
level
battlements
off
we
go
cried
he
when
the
cloak
stirred
itself
with
a
slight
slow
motion
as
if
waiting
his
orders
anywhere
anywhere
so
that
i
am
away
from
here
and
out
into
the
world
as
he
spoke
the
cloak
as
if
seized
suddenly
with
a
new
idea
bounded
forward
and
went
skimming
through
the
air
faster
than
the
very
fastest
railway
train
cried
prince
dolor
in
great
excitement
this
is
as
good
as
riding
a
race
and
he
patted
the
cloak
as
if
it
had
been
a
horse
that
is
in
the
way
he
supposed
horses
ought
to
be
patted
and
tossed
his
head
back
to
meet
the
fresh
breeze
and
pulled
his
up
and
his
hat
down
as
he
felt
the
wind
grow
keener
and
colder
colder
than
anything
he
had
ever
known
what
does
it
matter
though
said
he
i
a
boy
and
boys
ought
not
to
mind
anything
still
for
all
his
he
began
to
shiver
exceedingly
also
he
had
come
away
without
his
dinner
and
he
grew
frightfully
hungry
and
to
add
to
everything
the
sunshiny
day
changed
into
rain
and
being
high
up
in
the
very
midst
of
the
clouds
he
got
soaked
through
and
through
in
a
very
few
minutes
shall
i
turn
back
meditated
he
suppose
i
say
here
he
stopped
for
already
the
cloak
gave
an
obedient
lurch
as
if
it
were
expecting
to
be
sent
home
immediately
no
i
ca
i
ca
go
back
i
must
go
forward
and
see
the
world
but
oh
if
i
had
but
the
shabbiest
old
rug
to
shelter
me
from
the
rain
or
the
driest
morsel
of
bread
and
cheese
just
to
keep
me
from
starving
still
i
do
much
mind
i
a
prince
and
ought
to
be
able
to
stand
anything
hold
on
cloak
we
make
the
best
of
it
it
was
a
most
curious
circumstance
but
no
sooner
had
he
said
this
than
he
felt
stealing
over
his
knees
something
warm
and
soft
in
fact
a
most
beautiful
bearskin
which
folded
itself
round
him
quite
naturally
and
cuddled
him
up
as
closely
as
if
he
had
been
the
cub
of
the
kind
old
that
once
owned
it
then
feeling
in
his
pocket
which
suddenly
stuck
out
in
a
marvellous
way
he
found
not
exactly
bread
and
cheese
nor
even
sandwiches
but
a
packet
of
the
most
delicious
food
he
had
ever
tasted
it
was
not
meat
nor
pudding
but
a
combination
of
both
and
it
served
him
excellently
for
both
he
ate
his
dinner
with
the
greatest
gusto
imaginable
till
he
grew
so
thirsty
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
could
i
have
just
one
drop
of
water
if
it
did
trouble
you
too
much
kindest
of
godmothers
for
he
really
thought
this
want
was
beyond
her
power
to
supply
all
the
water
which
supplied
hopeless
tower
was
pumped
up
with
difficulty
from
a
deep
artesian
well
there
were
such
things
known
in
nomansland
which
had
been
made
at
the
foot
of
it
but
around
for
miles
upon
miles
the
desolate
plain
was
perfectly
dry
and
above
it
high
in
air
how
could
he
expect
to
find
a
well
or
to
get
even
a
drop
of
water
he
forgot
one
thing
the
rain
while
he
spoke
it
came
on
in
another
wild
burst
as
if
the
clouds
had
poured
themselves
out
in
a
passion
of
crying
wetting
him
certainly
but
leaving
behind
in
a
large
glass
vessel
which
he
had
never
noticed
before
enough
water
to
quench
the
thirst
of
two
or
three
boys
at
least
and
it
was
so
fresh
so
pure
as
water
from
the
clouds
always
is
when
it
does
not
catch
the
soot
from
city
chimneys
and
other
defilements
that
he
drank
it
every
drop
with
the
greatest
delight
and
content
also
as
soon
as
it
was
empty
the
rain
filled
it
again
so
that
he
was
able
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
and
refresh
himself
exceedingly
then
the
sun
came
out
and
dried
him
in
no
time
after
that
he
curled
himself
up
under
the
bearskin
rug
and
though
he
determined
to
be
the
most
boy
imaginable
being
so
exceedingly
snug
and
warm
and
comfortable
prince
dolor
condescended
to
shut
his
eyes
just
for
one
minute
the
next
minute
he
was
sound
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
floating
over
a
country
quite
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
seen
before
yet
it
was
nothing
but
what
most
of
you
children
see
every
day
and
never
notice
it
a
pretty
country
landscape
like
england
scotland
france
or
any
other
land
you
choose
to
name
it
had
no
particular
features
nothing
in
it
grand
or
lovely
was
simply
pretty
nothing
more
yet
to
prince
dolor
who
had
never
gone
beyond
his
lonely
tower
and
level
plain
it
appeared
the
most
charming
sight
imaginable
first
there
was
a
river
it
came
tumbling
down
the
hillside
frothing
and
foaming
playing
at
among
rocks
then
bursting
out
in
noisy
fun
like
a
child
to
bury
itself
in
deep
still
pools
afterwards
it
went
steadily
on
for
a
while
like
a
good
person
till
it
came
to
another
big
rock
where
it
misbehaved
itself
extremely
it
turned
into
a
cataract
and
went
tumbling
over
and
over
after
a
fashion
that
made
the
prince
who
had
never
seen
water
before
except
in
his
bath
or
his
clap
his
hands
with
delight
it
is
so
active
so
alive
i
like
things
active
and
alive
cried
he
and
watched
it
shimmering
and
dancing
whirling
and
leaping
till
after
a
few
windings
and
vagaries
it
settled
into
a
respectable
stream
after
that
it
went
along
deep
and
quiet
but
flowing
steadily
on
till
it
reached
a
large
lake
into
which
it
slipped
and
so
ended
its
course
illustration
a
few
windings
and
vagaries
it
settled
into
a
respectable
all
this
the
boy
saw
either
with
his
own
naked
eye
or
through
his
gold
spectacles
he
saw
also
as
in
a
picture
beautiful
but
silent
many
other
things
which
struck
him
with
wonder
especially
a
grove
of
trees
only
think
to
have
lived
to
his
age
which
he
himself
did
not
know
as
he
did
not
know
his
own
birthday
and
never
to
have
seen
trees
as
he
floated
over
these
oaks
they
seemed
to
him
trunk
branches
and
leaves
the
most
curious
sight
imaginable
if
i
could
only
get
nearer
so
as
to
touch
them
said
he
and
immediately
the
obedient
cloak
ducked
down
prince
dolor
made
a
snatch
at
the
topmost
twig
of
the
tallest
tree
and
caught
a
bunch
of
leaves
in
his
hand
just
a
bunch
of
green
leaves
such
as
we
see
in
myriads
watching
them
bud
grow
fall
and
then
kicking
them
along
on
the
ground
as
if
they
were
worth
nothing
yet
how
wonderful
they
are
every
one
of
them
a
little
different
i
do
suppose
you
could
ever
find
two
leaves
exactly
alike
in
form
colour
and
size
no
more
than
you
could
find
two
faces
alike
or
two
characters
exactly
the
same
the
plan
of
this
world
is
infinite
similarity
and
yet
infinite
variety
prince
dolor
examined
his
leaves
with
the
greatest
curiosity
and
also
a
little
caterpillar
that
he
found
walking
over
one
of
them
he
coaxed
it
to
take
an
additional
walk
over
his
finger
which
it
did
with
the
greatest
dignity
and
decorum
as
if
it
caterpillar
were
the
most
important
individual
in
existence
it
amused
him
for
a
long
time
and
when
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
blew
it
overboard
leaves
and
all
he
felt
quite
disconsolate
still
there
must
be
many
live
creatures
in
the
world
besides
caterpillars
i
should
like
to
see
a
few
of
them
the
cloak
gave
a
little
dip
down
as
if
to
say
all
right
my
prince
and
bore
him
across
the
oak
forest
to
a
long
fertile
valley
called
in
scotland
a
strath
and
in
england
a
weald
but
what
they
call
it
in
the
tongue
of
nomansland
i
do
not
know
it
was
made
up
of
cornfields
pasturefields
lanes
hedges
brooks
and
ponds
also
in
it
were
what
the
prince
had
desired
to
see
a
quantity
of
living
creatures
wild
and
tame
cows
and
horses
lambs
and
sheep
fed
in
the
meadows
pigs
and
fowls
walked
about
the
farmyards
and
in
lonelier
places
hares
scudded
rabbits
burrowed
and
pheasants
and
partridges
with
many
other
smaller
birds
inhabited
the
fields
and
woods
illustration
was
made
up
of
cornfields
pasturefields
lanes
hedges
brooks
and
illustration
it
were
what
the
prince
had
desired
to
see
a
quantity
of
living
through
his
wonderful
spectacles
the
prince
could
see
everything
but
as
i
said
it
was
a
silent
picture
he
was
too
high
up
to
catch
anything
except
a
faint
murmur
which
only
aroused
his
anxiety
to
hear
more
i
have
as
good
as
two
pairs
of
eyes
he
thought
i
wonder
if
my
godmother
would
give
me
a
second
pair
of
ears
scarcely
had
he
spoken
than
he
found
lying
on
his
lap
the
most
curious
little
parcel
all
done
up
in
silvery
paper
and
it
contained
what
do
you
think
actually
a
pair
of
silver
ears
which
when
he
tried
them
on
fitted
so
exactly
over
his
own
that
he
hardly
felt
them
except
for
the
difference
they
made
in
his
hearing
there
is
something
which
we
listen
to
daily
and
never
notice
i
mean
the
sounds
of
the
visible
world
animate
and
inanimate
winds
blowing
waters
flowing
trees
stirring
insects
whirring
dear
me
i
am
quite
unconsciously
writing
rhyme
with
the
various
cries
of
birds
and
beasts
lowing
cattle
bleating
sheep
grunting
pigs
and
cackling
hens
all
the
infinite
discords
that
somehow
or
other
make
a
beautiful
harmony
we
hear
this
and
are
so
accustomed
to
it
that
we
think
nothing
of
it
but
prince
dolor
who
had
lived
all
his
days
in
the
dead
silence
of
hopeless
tower
heard
it
for
the
first
time
and
oh
if
you
had
seen
his
face
he
listened
listened
as
if
he
could
never
have
done
listening
and
he
looked
and
looked
as
if
he
could
not
gaze
enough
above
all
the
motion
of
the
animals
delighted
him
cows
walking
horses
galloping
little
lambs
and
calves
running
races
across
the
meadows
were
such
a
treat
for
him
to
watch
he
that
was
always
so
quiet
but
these
creatures
having
four
legs
and
he
only
two
the
difference
did
not
strike
him
painfully
still
after
the
fashion
of
children
and
i
fear
of
many
big
people
too
he
began
to
want
something
more
than
he
had
something
that
would
be
quite
fresh
and
new
godmother
he
said
having
now
begun
to
believe
that
whether
he
saw
her
or
not
he
could
always
speak
to
her
with
full
confidence
that
she
would
hear
him
godmother
all
these
creatures
i
like
exceedingly
but
i
should
like
better
to
see
a
creature
like
myself
could
you
show
me
just
one
little
boy
there
was
a
sigh
behind
him
it
might
have
been
only
the
wind
and
the
cloak
remained
so
long
balanced
motionless
in
air
that
he
was
half
afraid
his
godmother
had
forgotten
him
or
was
offended
with
him
for
asking
too
much
suddenly
a
shrill
whistle
startled
him
even
through
his
silver
ears
and
looking
downwards
he
saw
start
up
from
behind
a
bush
on
a
common
something
neither
a
sheep
nor
a
horse
nor
a
cow
nothing
upon
four
legs
this
creature
had
only
two
but
they
were
long
straight
and
strong
and
it
had
a
lithe
active
body
and
a
curly
head
of
black
hair
set
upon
its
shoulders
it
was
a
boy
a
shepherdboy
about
the
prince
own
age
but
oh
so
different
not
that
he
was
an
ugly
boy
though
his
face
was
almost
as
red
as
his
hands
and
his
shaggy
hair
matted
like
the
backs
of
his
own
sheep
he
was
rather
a
lad
and
seemed
so
bright
and
healthy
and
jolly
would
be
the
word
only
i
am
not
sure
if
they
have
such
an
one
in
the
elegant
language
of
nomansland
that
the
little
prince
watched
him
with
great
admiration
might
he
come
and
play
with
me
i
would
drop
down
to
the
ground
to
him
or
fetch
him
up
to
me
here
oh
how
nice
it
would
be
if
i
only
had
a
little
boy
to
play
with
me
but
the
cloak
usually
so
obedient
to
his
wishes
disobeyed
him
now
there
were
evidently
some
things
which
his
godmother
either
could
not
or
would
not
give
the
cloak
hung
stationary
high
in
air
never
attempting
to
descend
the
shepherd
lad
evidently
took
it
for
a
large
bird
and
shading
his
eyes
looked
up
at
it
making
the
prince
heart
beat
fast
illustration
shepherd
lad
evidently
took
it
for
a
large
however
nothing
ensued
the
boy
turned
round
with
a
long
loud
whistle
seemingly
his
usual
and
only
way
of
expressing
his
feelings
he
could
not
make
the
thing
out
exactly
it
was
a
rather
mysterious
affair
but
it
did
not
trouble
him
much
was
not
an
examining
boy
then
stretching
himself
for
he
had
been
evidently
half
asleep
he
began
flopping
his
shoulders
with
his
arms
to
wake
and
warm
himself
while
his
dog
a
rough
collie
who
had
been
guarding
the
sheep
meanwhile
began
to
jump
upon
him
barking
with
delight
down
snap
down
stop
that
or
i
thrash
you
the
prince
heard
him
say
though
with
such
a
rough
hard
voice
and
queer
pronunciation
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
the
words
out
hollo
let
warm
ourselves
by
a
race
they
started
off
together
boy
and
dog
barking
and
shouting
till
it
was
doubtful
which
made
the
most
noise
or
ran
the
fastest
a
regular
it
was
first
across
the
level
common
greatly
disturbing
the
quiet
sheep
and
then
tearing
away
across
country
scrambling
through
hedges
and
leaping
ditches
and
tumbling
up
and
down
over
ploughed
fields
they
did
not
seem
to
have
anything
to
run
for
but
as
if
they
did
it
both
of
them
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
motion
and
what
a
pleasure
that
seemed
to
the
dog
of
course
but
scarcely
less
so
to
the
boy
how
he
skimmed
along
over
the
ground
his
cheeks
glowing
and
his
hair
flying
and
his
legs
oh
what
a
pair
of
legs
he
had
prince
dolor
watched
him
with
great
intentness
and
in
a
state
of
excitement
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
runner
himself
for
a
while
then
the
sweet
pale
face
grew
a
trifle
paler
the
lips
began
to
quiver
and
the
eyes
to
fill
how
nice
it
must
be
to
run
like
that
he
said
softly
thinking
that
never
no
never
in
this
world
would
he
be
able
to
do
the
same
now
he
understood
what
his
godmother
had
meant
when
she
gave
him
his
and
why
he
had
heard
that
sigh
he
was
sure
it
was
hers
when
he
had
asked
to
see
just
one
little
boy
i
think
i
had
rather
not
look
at
him
again
said
the
poor
little
prince
drawing
himself
back
into
the
centre
of
his
cloak
and
resuming
his
favourite
posture
sitting
like
a
turk
with
his
arms
wrapped
round
his
feeble
useless
legs
you
no
good
to
me
he
said
patting
them
mournfully
you
never
will
be
any
good
to
me
i
wonder
why
i
had
you
at
all
i
wonder
why
i
was
born
at
all
since
i
was
not
to
grow
up
like
other
little
boys
not
a
question
so
strange
so
sad
yet
so
often
occurring
in
some
form
or
other
in
this
world
as
you
will
find
my
children
when
you
are
older
that
even
if
he
had
put
it
to
his
mother
she
could
only
have
answered
it
as
we
have
to
answer
many
as
difficult
things
by
simply
saying
i
do
know
there
is
much
that
we
do
not
know
and
can
not
understand
we
big
folks
no
more
than
you
little
ones
we
have
to
accept
it
all
just
as
you
have
to
accept
anything
which
your
parents
may
tell
you
even
though
you
do
as
yet
see
the
reason
of
it
you
may
some
time
if
you
do
exactly
as
they
tell
you
and
are
content
to
wait
prince
dolor
sat
a
good
while
thus
or
it
appeared
to
him
a
good
while
so
many
thoughts
came
and
went
through
his
poor
young
mind
thoughts
of
great
bitterness
which
little
though
he
was
seemed
to
make
him
grow
years
older
in
a
few
minutes
then
he
fancied
the
cloak
began
to
rock
gently
to
and
fro
with
a
soothing
kind
of
motion
as
if
he
were
in
somebody
arms
somebody
who
did
not
speak
but
loved
him
and
comforted
him
without
need
of
words
not
by
deceiving
him
with
false
encouragement
or
hope
but
by
making
him
see
the
plain
hard
truth
in
all
its
hardness
and
thus
letting
him
quietly
face
it
till
it
grew
softened
down
and
did
not
seem
nearly
so
dreadful
after
all
through
the
dreary
silence
and
blankness
for
he
had
placed
himself
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
sky
and
had
taken
off
his
silver
ears
as
well
as
his
gold
spectacles
what
was
the
use
of
either
when
he
had
no
legs
to
walk
or
run
up
from
below
there
rose
a
delicious
sound
you
have
heard
it
hundreds
of
times
my
children
and
so
have
i
when
i
was
a
child
i
thought
there
was
nothing
so
sweet
and
i
think
so
still
it
was
just
the
song
of
a
skylark
mounting
higher
and
higher
from
the
ground
till
it
came
so
close
that
prince
dolor
could
distinguish
its
quivering
wings
and
tiny
body
almost
too
tiny
to
contain
such
a
gush
of
music
o
you
beautiful
beautiful
bird
cried
he
i
should
dearly
like
to
take
you
in
and
cuddle
you
that
is
if
i
could
if
i
dared
but
he
hesitated
the
little
brown
creature
with
its
loud
heavenly
voice
almost
made
him
afraid
nevertheless
it
also
made
him
happy
and
he
watched
and
listened
so
absorbed
that
he
forgot
all
regret
and
pain
forgot
everything
in
the
world
except
the
little
lark
it
soared
and
soared
and
he
was
just
wondering
if
it
would
soar
out
of
sight
and
what
in
the
world
he
should
do
when
it
was
gone
when
it
suddenly
closed
its
wings
as
larks
do
when
they
mean
to
drop
to
the
ground
but
instead
of
dropping
to
the
ground
it
dropped
right
into
the
little
boy
breast
what
felicity
if
it
would
only
stay
a
tiny
soft
thing
to
fondle
and
kiss
to
sing
to
him
all
day
long
and
be
his
playfellow
and
companion
tame
and
tender
while
to
the
rest
of
the
world
it
was
a
wild
bird
of
the
air
what
a
pride
what
a
delight
to
have
something
that
nobody
else
had
something
all
his
own
as
the
travelled
on
he
little
heeded
where
and
the
lark
still
stayed
nestled
down
in
his
bosom
hopped
from
his
hand
to
his
shoulder
and
kissed
him
with
its
dainty
beak
as
if
it
loved
him
prince
dolor
forgot
all
his
grief
and
was
entirely
happy
but
when
he
got
in
sight
of
hopeless
tower
a
painful
thought
struck
him
my
pretty
bird
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
if
i
take
you
into
my
room
and
shut
you
up
there
you
a
wild
skylark
of
the
air
what
will
become
of
you
i
am
used
to
this
but
you
are
not
you
will
be
so
miserable
and
suppose
my
nurse
should
find
you
she
who
ca
bear
the
sound
of
singing
besides
i
remember
her
once
telling
me
that
the
nicest
thing
she
ever
ate
in
her
life
was
lark
pie
the
little
boy
shivered
all
over
at
the
thought
and
though
the
merry
lark
immediately
broke
into
the
loudest
carol
as
if
saying
derisively
that
he
defied
anybody
to
eat
still
prince
dolor
was
very
uneasy
in
another
minute
he
had
made
up
his
mind
no
my
bird
nothing
so
dreadful
shall
happen
to
you
if
i
can
help
it
i
would
rather
do
without
you
altogether
yes
i
try
fly
away
my
darling
my
beautiful
my
merry
merry
bird
opening
his
two
caressing
hands
in
which
as
if
for
protection
he
had
folded
it
he
let
the
lark
go
it
lingered
a
minute
perching
on
the
rim
of
the
cloak
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
of
almost
human
tenderness
then
away
it
flew
far
up
into
the
blue
sky
it
was
only
a
bird
but
some
time
after
when
prince
dolor
had
eaten
his
supper
somewhat
drearily
except
for
the
thought
that
he
could
not
possibly
sup
off
lark
pie
now
and
gone
quietly
to
bed
the
old
familiar
little
bed
where
he
was
accustomed
to
sleep
or
lie
awake
contentedly
thinking
suddenly
he
heard
outside
the
window
a
little
faint
carol
faint
but
cheerful
cheerful
even
though
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
the
dear
little
lark
it
had
not
flown
away
after
all
and
it
was
truly
the
most
extraordinary
bird
for
unlike
ordinary
larks
it
kept
hovering
about
the
tower
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
night
outside
the
window
or
over
the
roof
whenever
he
listened
for
a
moment
he
heard
it
singing
still
he
went
to
sleep
as
happy
as
a
king
chapter
vii
happy
as
a
king
how
far
kings
are
happy
i
can
not
say
no
more
than
could
prince
dolor
though
he
had
once
been
a
king
himself
but
he
remembered
nothing
about
it
and
there
was
nobody
to
tell
him
except
his
nurse
who
had
been
forbidden
upon
pain
of
death
to
let
him
know
anything
about
his
dead
parents
or
the
king
his
uncle
or
indeed
any
part
of
his
own
history
sometimes
he
speculated
about
himself
whether
he
had
had
a
father
and
mother
as
other
little
boys
had
what
they
had
been
like
and
why
he
had
never
seen
them
but
knowing
nothing
about
them
he
did
not
miss
them
only
once
or
twice
reading
pretty
stories
about
little
children
and
their
mothers
who
helped
them
when
they
were
in
difficulty
and
comforted
them
when
they
were
sick
he
feeling
ill
and
dull
and
lonely
wondered
what
had
become
of
his
mother
and
why
she
never
came
to
see
him
then
in
his
history
lessons
of
course
he
read
about
kings
and
princes
and
the
governments
of
different
countries
and
the
events
that
happened
there
and
though
he
but
faintly
took
in
all
this
still
he
did
take
it
in
a
little
and
worried
his
young
brain
about
it
and
perplexed
his
nurse
with
questions
to
which
she
returned
sharp
and
mysterious
answers
which
only
set
him
thinking
the
more
he
had
plenty
of
time
for
thinking
after
his
last
journey
in
the
the
journey
which
had
given
him
so
much
pain
his
desire
to
see
the
world
had
somehow
faded
away
he
contented
himself
with
reading
his
books
and
looking
out
of
the
tower
windows
and
listening
to
his
beloved
little
lark
which
had
come
home
with
him
that
day
and
never
left
him
again
true
it
kept
out
of
the
way
and
though
his
nurse
sometimes
dimly
heard
it
and
said
what
is
that
horrid
noise
outside
she
never
got
the
faintest
chance
of
making
it
into
a
lark
pie
prince
dolor
had
his
pet
all
to
himself
and
though
he
seldom
saw
it
he
knew
it
was
near
him
and
he
caught
continually
at
odd
hours
of
the
day
and
even
in
the
night
fragments
of
its
delicious
song
all
during
the
winter
so
far
as
there
ever
was
any
difference
between
summer
and
winter
in
hopeless
tower
the
little
bird
cheered
and
amused
him
he
scarcely
needed
anything
more
not
even
his
which
lay
bundled
up
unnoticed
in
a
corner
tied
up
in
its
innumerable
knots
nor
did
his
godmother
come
near
him
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
given
these
treasures
and
left
him
alone
to
use
them
or
lose
them
apply
them
or
misapply
them
according
to
his
own
choice
that
is
all
we
can
do
with
children
when
they
grow
into
big
children
old
enough
to
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
and
too
old
to
be
forced
to
do
either
prince
dolor
was
now
quite
a
big
boy
not
tall
alas
he
never
could
be
that
with
his
poor
little
shrunken
legs
which
were
of
no
use
only
an
encumbrance
but
he
was
stout
and
strong
with
great
sturdy
shoulders
and
muscular
arms
upon
which
he
could
swing
himself
about
almost
like
a
monkey
as
if
in
compensation
for
his
useless
lower
limbs
nature
had
given
to
these
extra
strength
and
activity
his
face
too
was
very
handsome
thinner
firmer
more
manly
but
still
the
sweet
face
of
his
childhood
his
mother
own
face
how
his
mother
would
have
liked
to
look
at
him
perhaps
she
did
who
knows
the
boy
was
not
a
stupid
boy
either
he
could
learn
almost
anything
he
chose
and
he
did
choose
which
was
more
than
half
the
battle
he
never
gave
up
his
lessons
till
he
had
learnt
them
all
never
thought
it
a
punishment
that
he
had
to
work
at
them
and
that
they
cost
him
a
deal
of
trouble
sometimes
but
thought
he
men
work
and
it
must
be
so
grand
to
be
a
man
a
prince
too
and
i
fancy
princes
work
harder
than
anybody
except
kings
the
princes
i
read
about
generally
turn
into
kings
i
wonder
the
boy
was
always
wondering
nurse
and
one
day
he
startled
her
with
a
sudden
question
tell
me
shall
i
ever
be
a
king
the
woman
stood
perplexed
beyond
expression
so
long
a
time
had
passed
by
since
her
crime
if
it
was
a
crime
and
her
sentence
that
she
now
seldom
thought
of
either
even
her
punishment
to
be
shut
up
for
life
in
hopeless
tower
she
had
gradually
got
used
to
used
also
to
the
little
lame
prince
her
charge
whom
at
first
she
had
hated
though
she
carefully
did
everything
to
keep
him
alive
since
upon
him
her
own
life
hung
but
latterly
she
had
ceased
to
hate
him
and
in
a
sort
of
way
almost
loved
him
at
least
enough
to
be
sorry
for
him
an
innocent
child
imprisoned
here
till
he
grew
into
an
old
man
and
became
a
dull
creature
like
herself
sometimes
watching
him
she
felt
more
sorry
for
him
than
even
for
herself
and
then
seeing
she
looked
a
less
miserable
and
ugly
woman
he
did
not
shrink
from
her
as
usual
he
did
not
now
nurse
dear
nurse
said
he
i
do
mean
to
vex
you
but
tell
me
what
is
a
king
shall
i
ever
be
one
when
she
began
to
think
less
of
herself
and
more
of
the
child
the
woman
courage
increased
the
idea
came
to
her
what
harm
would
it
be
even
if
he
did
know
his
own
history
perhaps
he
ought
to
know
it
for
there
had
been
various
ups
and
downs
usurpations
revolutions
and
restorations
in
nomansland
as
in
most
other
countries
something
might
happen
who
could
tell
changes
might
occur
possibly
a
crown
would
even
yet
be
set
upon
those
pretty
fair
curls
which
she
began
to
think
prettier
than
ever
when
she
saw
the
imaginary
coronet
upon
them
she
sat
down
considering
whether
her
oath
never
to
say
a
word
to
prince
dolor
about
himself
would
be
broken
if
she
were
to
take
a
pencil
and
write
what
was
to
be
told
a
mere
quibble
a
mean
miserable
quibble
but
then
she
was
a
miserable
woman
more
to
be
pitied
than
scorned
after
long
doubt
and
with
great
trepidation
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
taking
the
prince
slate
with
the
sponge
tied
to
it
ready
to
rub
out
the
writing
in
a
minute
she
wrote
you
are
a
king
illustration
long
doubt
she
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
taking
the
prince
slate
wrote
are
a
king
prince
dolor
started
his
face
grew
pale
and
then
flushed
all
over
his
eyes
glistened
he
held
himself
erect
lame
as
he
was
anybody
could
see
he
was
born
to
be
a
king
hush
said
his
nurse
as
he
was
beginning
to
speak
and
then
terribly
frightened
all
the
while
people
who
have
done
wrong
always
are
frightened
she
wrote
down
in
a
few
hurried
sentences
his
history
how
his
parents
had
died
his
uncle
had
usurped
his
throne
and
sent
him
to
end
his
days
in
this
lonely
tower
i
too
added
she
bursting
into
tears
unless
indeed
you
could
get
out
into
the
world
and
fight
for
your
rights
like
a
man
and
fight
for
me
also
my
prince
that
i
may
not
die
in
this
desolate
place
poor
old
nurse
said
the
boy
compassionately
for
somehow
boy
as
he
was
when
he
heard
he
was
born
to
be
a
king
he
felt
like
a
man
like
a
king
who
could
afford
to
be
tender
because
he
was
strong
he
scarcely
slept
that
night
and
even
though
he
heard
his
little
lark
singing
in
the
sunrise
he
barely
listened
to
it
things
more
serious
and
important
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
suppose
thought
he
i
were
to
do
as
she
says
and
go
out
into
the
world
no
matter
how
it
hurts
me
the
world
of
people
active
people
as
active
as
that
boy
i
saw
they
might
only
laugh
at
me
poor
helpless
creature
that
i
am
but
still
i
might
show
them
i
could
do
something
at
any
rate
i
might
go
and
see
if
there
was
anything
for
me
to
do
godmother
help
me
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
asked
her
help
that
he
was
hardly
surprised
when
he
got
no
answer
only
the
little
lark
outside
the
window
sang
louder
and
louder
and
the
sun
rose
flooding
the
room
with
light
prince
dolor
sprang
out
of
bed
and
began
dressing
himself
which
was
hard
work
for
he
was
not
used
to
it
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
depend
upon
his
nurse
for
everything
but
i
must
now
learn
to
be
independent
thought
he
fancy
a
king
being
dressed
like
a
baby
so
he
did
the
best
he
could
awkwardly
but
cheerily
and
then
he
leaped
to
the
corner
where
lay
his
untied
it
as
before
and
watched
it
unrolling
itself
which
it
did
rapidly
with
a
hearty
as
if
quite
tired
of
idleness
so
was
prince
dolor
or
felt
as
if
he
was
he
jumped
into
the
middle
of
it
said
his
charm
and
was
out
through
the
skylight
immediately
pretty
lark
he
shouted
as
he
passed
it
on
the
wing
still
warbling
its
carol
to
the
sun
you
have
been
my
pleasure
my
delight
now
i
must
go
and
work
sing
to
old
nurse
till
i
come
back
again
perhaps
she
hear
you
perhaps
she
wo
but
it
will
do
her
good
all
the
same
but
as
the
cloak
hung
irresolute
in
air
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
not
determined
where
to
go
indeed
he
did
not
know
and
there
was
nobody
to
tell
him
godmother
he
cried
in
much
perplexity
you
know
what
i
want
at
least
i
hope
you
do
for
i
hardly
do
myself
take
me
where
i
ought
to
go
show
me
whatever
i
ought
so
see
never
mind
what
i
like
to
see
as
a
sudden
idea
came
into
his
mind
that
he
might
see
many
painful
and
disagreeable
things
but
this
journey
was
not
for
pleasure
as
before
he
was
not
a
baby
now
to
do
nothing
but
play
big
boys
do
not
always
play
nor
men
neither
they
work
thus
much
prince
dolor
knew
though
very
little
more
and
as
the
cloak
started
off
travelling
faster
than
he
had
ever
known
it
to
do
through
and
over
freezing
and
desolate
stretches
of
forest
and
smiling
cultivated
plains
and
great
lakes
that
seemed
to
him
almost
as
shoreless
as
the
sea
he
was
often
rather
frightened
but
he
crouched
down
silent
and
quiet
what
was
the
use
of
making
a
fuss
and
wrapping
himself
up
in
his
waited
for
what
was
to
happen
after
some
time
he
heard
a
murmur
in
the
distance
increasing
more
and
more
till
it
grew
like
the
hum
of
a
gigantic
hive
of
bees
and
stretching
his
chin
over
the
rim
of
his
cloak
prince
dolor
saw
far
far
below
him
yet
with
his
gold
spectacles
and
silver
ears
on
he
could
distinctly
hear
and
see
what
most
of
us
have
sometime
or
other
visited
a
great
metropolis
have
wandered
through
its
network
of
streets
lost
ourselves
in
its
crowds
of
people
looked
up
at
its
tall
rows
of
houses
its
grand
public
buildings
churches
and
squares
also
perhaps
we
have
peeped
into
its
miserable
little
back
alleys
where
dirty
children
play
in
gutters
all
day
and
half
the
night
or
where
men
reel
tipsy
and
women
fight
where
even
young
boys
go
about
picking
pockets
with
nobody
to
tell
them
it
is
wrong
except
the
policeman
and
he
simply
takes
them
off
to
prison
and
all
this
wretchedness
is
close
behind
the
grandeur
like
the
two
sides
of
the
leaf
of
a
book
an
awful
sight
is
a
large
city
seen
anyhow
from
anywhere
but
suppose
you
were
to
see
it
from
the
upper
air
where
with
your
eyes
and
ears
open
you
could
take
in
everything
at
once
what
would
it
look
like
how
would
you
feel
about
it
i
hardly
know
myself
do
you
prince
dolor
had
need
to
be
a
king
that
is
a
boy
with
a
kingly
nature
to
be
able
to
stand
such
a
sight
without
being
utterly
overcome
but
he
was
very
much
bewildered
as
bewildered
as
a
blind
person
who
is
suddenly
made
to
see
he
gazed
down
on
the
city
below
him
and
then
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
i
ca
bear
to
look
at
it
it
is
so
beautiful
so
dreadful
and
i
do
understand
it
not
one
bit
there
is
nobody
to
tell
me
about
it
i
wish
i
had
somebody
to
speak
to
do
you
then
pray
speak
to
me
i
was
always
considered
good
at
conversation
the
voice
that
squeaked
out
this
reply
was
an
excellent
imitation
of
the
human
one
though
it
came
only
from
a
bird
no
lark
this
time
however
but
a
great
black
and
white
creature
that
flew
into
the
cloak
and
began
walking
round
and
round
on
the
edge
of
it
with
a
dignified
stride
one
foot
before
the
other
like
any
unfeathered
biped
you
could
name
i
have
the
honour
of
your
acquaintance
sir
said
the
boy
politely
illustration
half
the
people
seemed
so
happy
and
illustration
other
half
were
so
wretched
and
if
you
please
i
am
a
mother
bird
and
my
name
is
mag
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
for
i
know
a
great
deal
and
i
enjoy
talking
my
family
is
of
great
antiquity
we
have
built
in
this
palace
for
hundreds
that
is
to
say
dozens
of
years
i
am
intimately
acquainted
with
the
king
the
queen
and
the
little
princes
and
princesses
also
the
maids
of
honour
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
i
talk
a
good
deal
but
i
always
talk
sense
and
i
dare
say
i
should
be
exceedingly
useful
to
a
poor
little
ignorant
boy
like
you
i
am
a
prince
said
the
other
gently
all
right
and
i
am
a
magpie
you
will
find
me
a
most
respectable
bird
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
was
the
polite
answer
though
he
thought
in
his
own
mind
that
mag
must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
herself
but
she
was
a
lady
and
a
stranger
so
of
course
he
was
civil
to
her
she
settled
herself
at
his
elbow
and
began
to
chatter
away
pointing
out
with
one
skinny
claw
while
she
balanced
herself
on
the
other
every
object
of
interest
evidently
believing
as
no
doubt
all
its
inhabitants
did
that
there
was
no
capital
in
the
world
like
the
great
metropolis
of
nomansland
i
have
not
seen
it
and
therefore
can
not
describe
it
so
we
will
just
take
it
upon
trust
and
suppose
it
to
be
like
every
other
fine
city
the
finest
city
that
ever
was
built
mag
said
so
and
of
course
she
knew
nevertheless
there
were
a
few
things
in
it
which
surprised
prince
dolor
and
as
he
had
said
he
could
not
understand
them
at
all
one
half
the
people
seemed
so
happy
and
busy
hurrying
up
and
down
the
full
streets
or
driving
lazily
along
the
parks
in
their
grand
carriages
while
the
other
half
were
so
wretched
and
miserable
ca
the
world
be
made
a
little
more
level
i
would
try
to
do
it
if
i
were
the
king
but
you
not
the
king
only
a
little
goose
of
a
boy
returned
the
magpie
loftily
and
i
here
not
to
explain
things
only
to
show
them
shall
i
show
you
the
royal
palace
it
was
a
very
magnificent
palace
it
had
terraces
and
gardens
battlements
and
towers
it
extended
over
acres
of
ground
and
had
in
it
rooms
enough
to
accommodate
half
the
city
its
windows
looked
in
all
directions
but
none
of
them
had
any
particular
view
except
a
small
one
high
up
towards
the
roof
which
looked
on
to
the
beautiful
mountains
but
since
the
queen
died
there
it
had
been
closed
boarded
up
indeed
the
magpie
said
it
was
so
little
and
inconvenient
that
nobody
cared
to
live
in
it
besides
the
lower
apartments
which
had
no
view
were
magnificent
worthy
of
being
inhabited
by
his
majesty
the
king
illustration
had
terraces
and
gardens
battlements
and
towers
and
had
in
it
rooms
enough
to
accommodate
half
the
illustration
windows
looked
in
all
directions
except
a
small
one
high
up
towards
the
roof
which
looked
on
to
the
beautiful
i
should
like
to
see
the
king
said
prince
dolor
but
what
followed
was
so
important
that
i
must
take
another
chapter
to
tell
it
in
chapter
viii
what
i
wonder
would
be
most
people
idea
of
a
king
what
was
prince
dolor
perhaps
a
very
splendid
personage
with
a
crown
on
his
head
and
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
sitting
on
a
throne
and
judging
the
people
always
doing
right
and
never
wrong
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
was
a
law
laid
down
in
olden
times
never
cross
or
tired
or
sick
or
suffering
perfectly
handsome
and
calm
and
ready
to
see
and
hear
everybody
and
discourteous
to
nobody
all
things
always
going
well
with
him
and
nothing
unpleasant
ever
happening
this
probably
was
what
prince
dolor
expected
to
see
and
what
did
he
see
but
i
must
tell
you
how
he
saw
it
ah
said
the
magpie
no
levée
the
king
is
ill
though
his
majesty
does
not
wish
it
to
be
generally
known
it
would
be
so
very
inconvenient
he
ca
see
you
but
perhaps
you
might
like
to
go
and
take
a
look
at
him
in
a
way
i
often
do
it
is
so
very
amusing
amusing
indeed
the
prince
was
just
now
too
much
excited
to
talk
much
was
he
not
going
to
see
the
king
his
uncle
who
had
succeeded
his
father
and
dethroned
himself
had
stepped
into
all
the
pleasant
things
that
he
prince
dolor
ought
to
have
had
and
shut
him
up
in
a
desolate
tower
what
was
he
like
this
great
bad
clever
man
had
he
got
all
the
things
he
wanted
which
another
ought
to
have
had
and
did
he
enjoy
them
nobody
knows
answered
the
magpie
just
as
if
she
had
been
sitting
inside
the
prince
heart
instead
of
on
the
top
of
his
shoulder
he
is
a
king
and
that
enough
for
the
rest
nobody
knows
as
she
spoke
mag
flew
down
on
to
the
palace
roof
where
the
cloak
had
rested
settling
down
between
the
great
stacks
of
chimneys
as
comfortably
as
if
on
the
ground
she
pecked
at
the
tiles
with
her
beak
truly
she
was
a
wonderful
bird
and
immediately
a
little
hole
opened
a
sort
of
door
through
which
could
be
seen
distinctly
the
chamber
below
illustration
pecked
at
the
tiles
with
her
beak
a
little
hole
opened
look
in
prince
make
haste
for
i
must
soon
shut
it
up
again
now
look
in
my
prince
make
haste
for
i
must
soon
shut
it
up
again
but
the
boy
hesitated
is
it
rude
wo
they
think
us
intruding
o
dear
no
there
a
hole
like
this
in
every
palace
dozens
of
holes
indeed
everybody
knows
it
but
nobody
speaks
of
it
intrusion
why
though
the
royal
family
are
supposed
to
live
shut
up
behind
stone
walls
ever
so
thick
all
the
world
knows
that
they
live
in
a
glass
house
where
everybody
can
see
them
and
throw
a
stone
at
them
now
pop
down
on
your
knees
and
take
a
peep
at
his
majesty
his
majesty
the
prince
gazed
eagerly
down
into
a
large
room
the
largest
room
he
had
ever
beheld
with
furniture
and
hangings
grander
than
anything
he
could
have
ever
imagined
a
stray
sunbeam
coming
through
a
crevice
of
the
darkened
windows
struck
across
the
carpet
and
it
was
the
loveliest
carpet
ever
woven
just
like
a
bed
of
flowers
to
walk
over
only
nobody
walked
over
it
the
room
being
perfectly
empty
and
silent
where
is
the
king
asked
the
puzzled
boy
there
said
mag
pointing
with
one
wrinkled
claw
to
a
magnificent
bed
large
enough
to
contain
six
people
in
the
centre
of
it
just
visible
under
the
silken
counterpane
quite
straight
and
still
with
its
head
on
the
lace
pillow
lay
a
small
figure
something
like
waxwork
fast
asleep
very
fast
asleep
there
were
a
quantity
of
sparkling
rings
on
the
tiny
yellow
hands
that
were
curled
a
little
helplessly
like
a
baby
outside
the
coverlet
the
eyes
were
shut
the
nose
looked
sharp
and
thin
and
the
long
grey
beard
hid
the
mouth
and
lay
over
the
breast
a
sight
not
ugly
nor
frightening
only
solemn
and
quiet
and
so
very
silent
two
little
flies
buzzing
about
the
curtains
of
the
bed
being
the
only
audible
sound
is
that
the
king
whispered
prince
dolor
yes
replied
the
bird
he
had
been
angry
furiously
angry
ever
since
he
knew
how
his
uncle
had
taken
the
crown
and
sent
him
a
poor
little
helpless
child
to
be
shut
up
for
life
just
as
if
he
had
been
dead
many
times
the
boy
had
felt
as
if
king
as
he
was
he
should
like
to
strike
him
this
great
strong
wicked
man
why
you
might
as
well
have
struck
a
baby
how
helpless
he
lay
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
idle
hands
folded
they
had
no
more
work
to
do
bad
or
good
what
is
the
matter
with
him
asked
the
prince
again
he
is
dead
said
the
magpie
with
a
croak
no
there
was
not
the
least
use
in
being
angry
with
him
now
on
the
contrary
the
prince
felt
almost
sorry
for
him
except
that
he
looked
so
peaceful
with
all
his
cares
at
rest
and
this
was
being
dead
so
even
kings
died
well
well
he
had
an
easy
life
folk
say
for
all
his
grandeur
perhaps
he
is
glad
it
is
over
your
majesty
with
another
cheerful
tap
of
her
beak
mistress
mag
shut
down
the
little
door
in
the
tiles
and
prince
dolor
first
and
last
sight
of
his
uncle
was
ended
he
sat
in
the
centre
of
his
silent
and
thoughtful
what
shall
we
do
now
said
the
magpie
there
nothing
much
more
to
be
done
with
his
majesty
except
a
fine
funeral
which
i
shall
certainly
go
and
see
all
the
world
will
he
interested
the
world
exceedingly
when
he
was
alive
and
he
ought
to
do
it
now
dead
just
once
more
and
since
he
ca
hear
me
i
may
as
well
say
that
on
the
whole
his
majesty
is
much
better
dead
than
alive
if
we
can
only
get
somebody
in
his
place
there
be
such
a
row
in
the
city
presently
suppose
we
float
up
again
and
see
it
all
at
a
safe
distance
though
it
will
be
such
fun
what
will
be
fun
a
revolution
whether
anybody
except
a
magpie
would
have
called
it
fun
i
know
but
it
certainly
was
a
remarkable
scene
as
soon
as
the
cathedral
bell
began
to
toll
and
the
minute
guns
to
fire
announcing
to
the
kingdom
that
it
was
without
a
king
the
people
gathered
in
crowds
stopping
at
street
corners
to
talk
together
the
murmur
now
and
then
rose
into
a
shout
and
the
shout
into
a
roar
when
prince
dolor
quietly
floating
in
upper
air
caught
the
sound
of
their
different
and
opposite
cries
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
whole
city
had
gone
mad
together
long
live
the
king
the
king
is
dead
down
with
the
king
down
with
the
crown
and
the
king
too
hurrah
for
the
republic
hurrah
for
no
government
at
all
such
were
the
shouts
which
travelled
up
to
the
and
then
began
oh
what
a
scene
when
you
children
are
grown
men
and
women
or
before
you
will
hear
and
read
in
books
about
what
are
called
revolutions
earnestly
i
trust
that
neither
i
nor
you
may
ever
see
one
but
they
have
happened
and
may
happen
again
in
other
countries
beside
nomansland
when
wicked
kings
have
helped
to
make
their
people
wicked
too
or
out
of
an
unrighteous
nation
have
sprung
rulers
equally
bad
or
without
either
of
these
causes
when
a
restless
country
has
fancied
any
change
better
than
no
change
at
all
for
me
i
do
like
changes
unless
pretty
sure
that
they
are
for
good
and
how
good
can
come
out
of
absolute
evil
the
horrible
evil
that
went
on
this
night
under
prince
dolor
very
eyes
soldiers
shooting
people
down
by
hundreds
in
the
streets
scaffolds
erected
and
heads
dropping
off
houses
burnt
and
women
and
children
murdered
this
is
more
than
i
can
understand
but
all
these
things
you
will
find
in
history
my
children
and
must
judge
for
yourselves
the
right
and
wrong
of
them
as
far
as
anybody
ever
can
judge
prince
dolor
saw
it
all
things
happened
so
fast
after
one
another
that
they
quite
confused
his
faculties
oh
let
me
go
home
he
cried
at
last
stopping
his
ears
and
shutting
his
eyes
only
let
me
go
home
for
even
his
lonely
tower
seemed
home
and
its
dreariness
and
silence
absolute
paradise
after
all
this
then
said
the
magpie
flapping
her
wings
she
had
been
chatting
incessantly
all
day
and
all
night
for
it
was
actually
thus
long
that
prince
dolor
had
been
hovering
over
the
city
neither
eating
nor
sleeping
with
all
these
terrible
things
happening
under
his
very
eyes
you
had
enough
i
suppose
of
seeing
the
world
oh
i
have
i
have
cried
the
prince
with
a
shudder
that
is
till
next
time
all
right
your
royal
highness
you
know
me
but
i
know
you
we
may
meet
again
sometime
she
looked
at
him
with
her
clear
piercing
eyes
sharp
enough
to
see
through
everything
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
changed
from
bird
eyes
to
human
eyes
the
very
eyes
of
his
godmother
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
ever
so
long
but
the
minute
afterwards
she
became
only
a
bird
and
with
a
screech
and
a
chatter
spread
her
wings
and
flew
away
prince
dolor
fell
into
a
kind
of
swoon
of
utter
misery
bewilderment
and
exhaustion
and
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
in
his
own
room
alone
and
quiet
with
the
dawn
just
breaking
and
the
long
rim
of
yellow
light
in
the
horizon
glimmering
through
the
window
panes
chapter
ix
when
prince
dolor
sat
up
in
bed
trying
to
remember
where
he
was
whither
he
had
been
and
what
he
had
seen
the
day
before
he
perceived
that
his
room
was
empty
generally
his
nurse
rather
worried
him
by
breaking
his
slumbers
coming
in
and
setting
things
to
rights
as
she
called
it
now
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
chairs
and
tables
there
was
no
harsh
voice
heard
to
scold
him
for
not
getting
up
immediately
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
this
boy
did
not
always
do
for
he
so
enjoyed
lying
still
and
thinking
lazily
about
everything
or
nothing
that
if
he
had
not
tried
hard
against
it
he
would
certainly
have
become
like
those
celebrated
two
little
men
who
lay
in
their
bed
till
the
clock
struck
ten
it
was
striking
ten
now
and
still
no
nurse
was
to
be
seen
he
was
rather
relieved
at
first
for
he
felt
so
tired
and
besides
when
he
stretched
out
his
arm
he
found
to
his
dismay
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
in
his
clothes
very
uncomfortable
he
felt
of
course
and
just
a
little
frightened
especially
when
he
began
to
call
and
call
again
but
nobody
answered
often
he
used
to
think
how
nice
it
would
be
to
get
rid
of
his
nurse
and
live
in
this
tower
all
by
himself
like
a
sort
of
monarch
able
to
do
everything
he
liked
and
leave
undone
all
that
he
did
not
want
to
do
but
now
that
this
seemed
really
to
have
happened
he
did
not
like
it
at
all
nurse
dear
nurse
please
come
back
he
called
out
come
back
and
i
will
be
the
best
boy
in
all
the
land
and
when
she
did
not
come
back
and
nothing
but
silence
answered
his
lamentable
call
he
very
nearly
began
to
cry
this
wo
do
he
said
at
last
dashing
the
tears
from
his
eyes
it
just
like
a
baby
and
i
a
big
boy
shall
be
a
man
some
day
what
has
happened
i
wonder
i
go
and
see
he
sprang
out
of
bed
not
to
his
feet
alas
but
to
his
poor
little
weak
knees
and
crawled
on
them
from
room
to
room
all
the
four
chambers
were
deserted
not
forlorn
or
untidy
for
everything
seemed
to
have
been
done
for
his
comfort
the
breakfast
and
were
laid
the
food
spread
in
order
he
might
live
like
a
prince
as
the
proverb
is
for
several
days
but
the
place
was
entirely
forsaken
there
was
evidently
not
a
creature
but
himself
in
the
solitary
tower
a
great
fear
came
upon
the
poor
boy
lonely
as
his
life
had
been
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
absolutely
alone
a
kind
of
despair
seized
him
no
violent
anger
or
terror
but
a
sort
of
patient
desolation
what
in
the
world
am
i
to
do
thought
he
and
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
half
inclined
to
believe
that
it
would
be
better
to
give
up
entirely
lay
himself
down
and
die
this
feeling
however
did
not
last
long
for
he
was
young
and
strong
and
i
said
before
by
nature
a
very
courageous
boy
there
came
into
his
head
somehow
or
other
a
proverb
that
his
nurse
had
taught
him
the
people
of
nomansland
were
very
fond
of
proverbs
for
every
evil
under
the
sun
there
is
a
remedy
or
there
none
if
there
is
one
try
to
find
it
if
there
is
never
mind
it
i
wonder
is
there
a
remedy
now
and
could
i
find
it
cried
the
prince
jumping
up
and
looking
out
of
the
window
no
help
there
he
only
saw
the
broad
bleak
sunshiny
plain
that
is
at
first
but
in
the
circle
of
mud
that
surrounded
the
base
of
the
tower
he
perceived
distinctly
the
marks
of
a
horse
feet
and
just
in
the
spot
where
the
was
accustomed
to
tie
up
his
great
black
charger
while
he
himself
ascended
there
lay
the
remains
of
a
bundle
of
hay
and
a
feed
of
corn
yes
that
it
he
has
come
and
gone
taking
nurse
away
with
him
poor
nurse
how
glad
she
would
be
to
go
that
was
prince
dolor
first
thought
his
second
was
it
natural
was
a
passionate
indignation
at
her
cruelty
at
the
cruelty
of
all
the
world
towards
him
a
poor
little
helpless
boy
then
he
determined
forsaken
as
he
was
to
try
and
hold
on
to
the
last
and
not
to
die
as
long
as
he
could
possibly
help
it
anyhow
it
would
be
easier
to
die
here
than
out
in
the
world
among
the
terrible
doings
which
he
had
just
beheld
from
the
midst
of
which
it
suddenly
struck
him
the
had
come
contrived
somehow
to
make
the
nurse
understand
that
the
king
was
dead
and
she
need
have
no
fear
in
going
back
to
the
capital
where
there
was
a
grand
revolution
and
everything
turned
upside
down
so
of
course
she
had
gone
i
hope
she
enjoy
it
miserable
woman
if
they
do
cut
off
her
head
too
and
then
a
kind
of
remorse
smote
him
for
feeling
so
bitterly
towards
her
after
all
the
years
she
had
taken
care
of
him
grudgingly
perhaps
and
coldly
still
she
had
taken
care
of
him
and
that
even
to
the
last
for
as
i
have
said
all
his
four
rooms
were
as
tidy
as
possible
and
his
meals
laid
out
that
he
might
have
no
more
trouble
than
could
be
helped
possibly
she
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
i
wo
judge
her
said
he
and
afterwards
he
was
very
glad
that
he
had
so
determined
for
the
second
time
he
tried
to
dress
himself
and
then
to
do
everything
he
could
for
himself
even
to
sweeping
up
the
hearth
and
putting
on
more
coals
it
a
funny
thing
for
a
prince
to
have
to
do
said
he
laughing
but
my
godmother
once
said
princes
need
never
mind
doing
anything
and
then
he
thought
a
little
of
his
godmother
not
of
summoning
her
or
asking
her
to
help
him
she
had
evidently
left
him
to
help
himself
and
he
was
determined
to
try
his
best
to
do
it
being
a
very
proud
and
independent
boy
but
he
remembered
her
tenderly
and
regretfully
as
if
even
she
had
been
a
little
hard
upon
him
poor
forlorn
boy
that
he
was
but
he
seemed
to
have
seen
and
learned
so
much
within
the
last
few
days
that
he
scarcely
felt
like
a
boy
but
a
man
until
he
went
to
bed
at
night
when
i
was
a
child
i
used
often
to
think
how
nice
it
would
be
to
live
in
a
little
house
all
by
my
own
self
a
house
built
high
up
in
a
tree
or
far
away
in
a
forest
or
half
way
up
a
hillside
so
deliciously
alone
and
independent
not
a
lesson
to
learn
but
no
i
always
liked
learning
my
lessons
anyhow
to
choose
the
lessons
i
liked
best
to
have
as
many
books
to
read
and
dolls
to
play
with
as
ever
i
wanted
above
all
to
be
free
and
at
rest
with
nobody
to
teaze
or
trouble
or
scold
me
would
be
charming
for
i
was
a
lonely
little
thing
who
liked
quietness
as
many
children
do
which
other
children
and
sometimes
people
even
can
not
always
understand
and
so
i
can
understand
prince
dolor
after
his
first
despair
he
was
not
merely
comfortable
but
actually
happy
in
his
solitude
doing
everything
for
himself
and
enjoying
everything
by
himself
until
bedtime
then
he
did
not
like
it
at
all
no
more
i
suppose
than
other
children
would
have
liked
my
imaginary
house
in
a
tree
when
they
had
had
sufficient
of
their
own
company
but
the
prince
had
to
bear
it
and
he
did
bear
it
like
a
prince
for
fully
five
days
all
that
time
he
got
up
in
the
morning
and
went
to
bed
at
night
without
having
spoken
to
a
creature
or
indeed
heard
a
single
sound
for
even
his
little
lark
was
silent
and
as
for
his
either
he
never
thought
about
it
or
else
it
had
been
spirited
away
for
he
made
no
use
of
it
nor
attempted
to
do
so
a
very
strange
existence
it
was
those
five
lonely
days
he
never
entirely
forgot
it
it
threw
him
back
upon
himself
and
into
himself
in
a
way
that
all
of
us
have
to
learn
when
we
grow
up
and
are
the
better
for
it
but
it
is
somewhat
hard
learning
on
the
sixth
day
prince
dolor
had
a
strange
composure
in
his
look
but
he
was
very
grave
and
thin
and
white
he
had
nearly
come
to
the
end
of
his
provisions
and
what
was
to
happen
next
get
out
of
the
tower
he
could
not
the
ladder
the
used
was
always
carried
away
again
and
if
it
had
not
been
how
could
the
poor
boy
have
used
it
and
even
if
he
slung
or
flung
himself
down
and
by
miraculous
chance
came
alive
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
how
could
he
run
away
fate
had
been
very
hard
to
him
or
so
it
seemed
he
made
up
his
mind
to
die
not
that
he
wished
to
die
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
great
deal
that
he
wished
to
live
to
do
but
if
he
must
die
he
must
dying
did
not
seem
so
very
dreadful
not
even
to
lie
quiet
like
his
uncle
whom
he
had
entirely
forgiven
now
and
neither
be
miserable
nor
naughty
any
more
and
escape
all
those
horrible
things
that
he
had
seen
going
on
outside
the
palace
in
that
awful
place
which
was
called
the
world
it
a
great
deal
nicer
here
said
the
poor
little
prince
and
collected
all
his
pretty
things
round
him
his
favourite
pictures
which
he
thought
he
should
like
to
have
near
him
when
he
died
his
books
and
toys
no
he
had
ceased
to
care
for
toys
now
he
only
liked
them
because
he
had
done
so
as
a
child
and
there
he
sat
very
calm
and
patient
like
a
king
in
his
castle
waiting
for
the
end
still
i
wish
i
had
done
something
first
something
worth
doing
that
somebody
might
remember
me
by
thought
he
suppose
i
had
grown
a
man
and
had
had
work
to
do
and
people
to
care
for
and
was
so
useful
and
busy
that
they
liked
me
and
perhaps
even
forgot
i
was
lame
then
it
would
have
been
nice
to
live
i
think
a
tear
came
into
the
little
fellow
eyes
and
he
listened
intently
through
the
dead
silence
for
some
hopeful
sound
was
there
one
was
it
his
little
lark
whom
he
had
almost
forgotten
no
nothing
half
so
sweet
but
it
really
was
something
something
which
came
nearer
and
nearer
so
that
there
was
no
mistaking
it
it
was
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
one
of
the
great
silver
trumpets
so
admired
in
nomansland
not
pleasant
music
but
very
bold
grand
and
inspiring
as
he
listened
to
it
the
boy
seemed
to
recall
many
things
which
had
slipped
his
memory
for
years
and
to
nerve
himself
for
whatever
might
be
going
to
happen
what
had
happened
was
this
the
poor
condemned
woman
had
not
been
such
a
wicked
woman
after
all
perhaps
her
courage
was
not
wholly
disinterested
but
she
had
done
a
very
heroic
thing
as
soon
as
she
heard
of
the
death
and
burial
of
the
king
and
of
the
changes
that
were
taking
place
in
the
country
a
daring
idea
came
into
her
head
to
set
upon
the
throne
of
nomansland
its
rightful
heir
thereupon
she
persuaded
the
to
take
her
away
with
him
and
they
galloped
like
the
wind
from
city
to
city
spreading
everywhere
the
news
that
prince
dolor
death
and
burial
had
been
an
invention
concocted
by
his
wicked
uncle
that
he
was
alive
and
well
and
the
noblest
young
prince
that
ever
was
born
it
was
a
bold
stroke
but
it
succeeded
the
country
weary
perhaps
of
the
late
king
harsh
rule
and
yet
glad
to
save
itself
from
the
horrors
of
the
last
few
days
and
the
still
further
horrors
of
no
rule
at
all
and
having
no
particular
interest
in
the
other
young
princes
jumped
at
the
idea
of
this
prince
who
was
the
son
of
their
late
good
king
and
the
beloved
queen
dolorez
hurrah
for
prince
dolor
let
prince
dolor
be
our
sovereign
rang
from
end
to
end
of
the
kingdom
everybody
tried
to
remember
what
a
dear
baby
he
once
was
how
like
his
mother
who
had
been
so
sweet
and
kind
and
his
father
the
finest
looking
king
that
ever
reigned
nobody
remembered
his
lameness
or
if
they
did
they
passed
it
over
as
a
matter
of
no
consequence
they
were
determined
to
have
him
to
reign
over
them
boy
as
he
was
perhaps
just
because
he
was
a
boy
since
in
that
case
the
great
nobles
thought
they
should
be
able
to
do
as
they
liked
with
the
country
accordingly
with
a
fickleness
not
confined
to
the
people
of
nomansland
no
sooner
was
the
late
king
laid
in
his
grave
than
they
pronounced
him
to
have
been
a
usurper
turned
all
his
family
out
of
the
palace
and
left
it
empty
for
the
reception
of
the
new
sovereign
whom
they
went
to
fetch
with
great
rejoicing
a
select
body
of
lords
gentlemen
and
soldiers
travelling
night
and
day
in
solemn
procession
through
the
country
until
they
reached
hopeless
tower
there
they
found
the
prince
sitting
calmly
on
the
floor
deadly
pale
indeed
for
he
expected
a
quite
different
end
from
this
and
was
resolved
if
he
had
to
die
to
die
courageously
like
a
prince
and
a
king
but
when
they
hailed
him
as
prince
and
king
and
explained
to
him
how
matters
stood
and
went
down
on
their
knees
before
him
offering
the
crown
on
a
velvet
cushion
with
four
golden
tassels
each
nearly
as
big
as
his
head
small
though
he
was
and
lame
which
lameness
the
courtiers
pretended
not
to
notice
there
came
such
a
glow
into
his
face
such
a
dignity
into
his
demeanour
that
he
became
beautiful
yes
he
said
if
you
desire
it
i
will
be
your
king
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
make
my
people
happy
then
there
arose
from
inside
and
outside
the
tower
such
a
shout
as
never
yet
was
heard
across
the
lonely
plain
prince
dolor
shrank
a
little
from
the
deafening
sound
how
shall
i
be
able
to
rule
all
this
great
people
you
forget
my
lords
that
i
am
only
a
little
boy
still
not
so
very
little
was
the
respectful
answer
we
have
searched
in
the
records
and
found
that
your
royal
highness
your
majesty
i
mean
is
precisely
fifteen
years
old
am
i
said
prince
dolor
and
his
first
thought
was
a
thoroughly
childish
pleasure
that
he
should
now
have
a
birthday
with
a
whole
nation
to
keep
it
then
he
remembered
that
his
childish
days
were
done
he
was
a
monarch
now
even
his
nurse
to
whom
the
moment
he
saw
her
he
had
held
out
his
hand
kissed
it
reverently
and
called
him
ceremoniously
his
majesty
the
king
a
king
must
be
always
a
king
i
suppose
said
he
half
sadly
when
the
ceremonies
over
he
had
been
left
to
himself
for
just
ten
minutes
to
put
off
his
boy
clothes
and
be
in
magnificent
robes
before
he
was
conveyed
away
from
his
tower
to
the
royal
palace
he
could
take
nothing
with
him
indeed
he
soon
saw
that
however
politely
they
spoke
they
would
not
allow
him
to
take
anything
if
he
was
to
be
their
king
he
must
give
up
his
old
life
for
ever
so
he
looked
with
tender
farewell
on
his
old
books
old
toys
the
furniture
he
knew
so
well
and
the
familiar
plain
in
all
its
levelness
ugly
yet
pleasant
simply
because
it
was
familiar
it
will
be
a
new
life
in
a
new
world
said
he
to
himself
but
remember
the
old
things
still
and
oh
if
before
i
go
i
could
but
once
see
my
dear
old
godmother
while
he
spoke
he
had
laid
himself
down
on
the
bed
for
a
minute
or
two
rather
tired
with
his
grandeur
and
confused
by
the
noise
of
the
trumpets
which
kept
playing
incessantly
down
below
he
gazed
half
sadly
up
to
the
skylight
whence
there
came
pouring
a
stream
of
with
innumerable
motes
floating
there
like
a
bridge
thrown
between
heaven
and
earth
sliding
down
it
as
if
she
had
been
made
of
air
came
the
little
old
woman
in
grey
illustration
came
pouring
a
stream
of
like
a
bridge
sliding
down
it
as
if
she
had
been
made
of
air
came
the
little
old
woman
in
so
beautiful
looked
she
old
as
she
was
that
prince
dolor
was
at
first
quite
startled
by
the
apparition
then
he
held
out
his
arms
in
eager
delight
o
godmother
you
have
not
forsaken
me
not
at
all
my
son
you
may
not
have
seen
me
but
i
have
seen
you
many
a
time
how
o
never
mind
i
can
turn
into
anything
i
please
you
know
and
i
have
been
a
rug
and
a
crystal
goblet
and
sometimes
i
have
changed
from
inanimate
to
animate
nature
put
on
feathers
and
made
myself
very
comfortable
as
a
bird
ha
laughed
the
prince
a
new
light
breaking
in
upon
him
as
he
caught
the
infection
of
her
tone
lively
and
mischievous
ha
ha
a
lark
for
instance
or
a
magpie
answered
she
with
a
capital
imitation
of
mistress
mag
croaky
voice
do
you
suppose
i
am
always
sentimental
and
never
funny
if
anything
makes
you
happy
gay
or
grave
do
you
think
it
is
more
than
likely
to
come
through
your
old
godmother
i
believe
that
said
the
boy
tenderly
holding
out
his
arms
they
clasped
one
another
in
a
close
embrace
suddenly
prince
dolor
looked
very
anxious
you
will
not
leave
me
now
that
i
am
a
king
otherwise
i
had
rather
not
be
a
king
at
all
promise
never
to
forsake
me
the
little
old
woman
laughed
gaily
forsake
you
that
is
impossible
but
it
is
just
possible
you
may
forsake
me
not
probable
though
your
mother
never
did
and
she
was
a
queen
the
sweetest
queen
in
all
the
world
was
the
lady
dolorez
tell
me
about
her
said
the
boy
eagerly
as
i
get
older
i
think
i
can
understand
more
do
tell
me
not
now
you
could
hear
me
for
the
trumpets
and
the
shouting
but
when
you
are
come
to
the
palace
ask
for
a
upper
room
which
looks
out
upon
the
beautiful
mountains
open
it
and
take
it
for
your
own
whenever
you
go
there
you
will
always
find
me
and
we
will
talk
together
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
about
my
mother
the
little
old
woman
nodded
and
kept
nodding
and
smiling
to
herself
many
times
as
the
boy
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
sweet
words
he
had
never
known
or
understood
my
mother
my
mother
now
i
must
go
said
she
as
the
trumpets
blared
louder
and
louder
and
the
shouts
of
the
people
showed
that
they
would
not
endure
any
delay
open
the
window
and
out
i
fly
prince
dolor
repeated
gaily
the
musical
rhyme
but
all
the
while
tried
to
hold
his
godmother
fast
vain
vain
for
the
moment
that
a
knocking
was
heard
at
his
door
the
sun
went
behind
a
cloud
the
bright
stream
of
dancing
motes
vanished
and
the
little
old
woman
with
them
he
knew
not
where
so
prince
dolor
quitted
his
tower
which
he
had
entered
so
mournfully
and
ignominiously
as
a
little
helpless
baby
carried
in
the
arms
quitted
it
as
the
great
king
of
nomansland
illustration
prince
dolor
quitted
his
tower
quitted
it
as
the
great
king
of
the
only
thing
he
took
away
with
him
was
something
so
insignificant
that
none
of
the
lords
gentlemen
and
soldiers
who
escorted
him
with
such
triumphant
splendour
could
possibly
notice
it
a
tiny
bundle
which
he
had
found
lying
on
the
floor
just
where
the
bridge
of
sunbeams
had
rested
at
once
he
had
pounced
upon
it
and
thrust
it
secretly
into
his
bosom
where
it
dwindled
into
such
small
proportions
that
it
might
have
been
taken
for
a
mere
a
bit
of
flannel
or
an
old
it
was
his
chapter
x
did
prince
dolor
become
a
great
king
was
he
though
little
more
than
a
boy
the
father
of
his
people
as
all
kings
ought
to
be
did
his
reign
last
long
long
and
happy
and
what
were
the
principal
events
of
it
as
chronicled
in
the
history
of
nomansland
why
if
i
were
to
answer
all
these
questions
i
should
have
to
write
another
book
and
i
tired
children
tired
as
people
sometimes
are
though
not
always
with
play
besides
i
have
a
small
person
belonging
to
me
who
though
she
likes
extremely
to
listen
to
the
story
of
this
book
grumbles
much
at
the
writing
of
it
and
has
run
about
the
house
clapping
her
hands
with
joy
when
mamma
told
her
that
it
was
nearly
finished
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
have
related
as
well
as
i
could
the
history
of
prince
dolor
but
with
the
history
of
nomansland
i
am
as
yet
unacquainted
if
anybody
knows
it
perhaps
he
or
she
will
kindly
write
it
all
down
in
another
book
but
mine
is
done
however
of
this
i
am
sure
that
prince
dolor
made
an
excellent
king
nobody
ever
does
anything
less
well
not
even
the
commonest
duty
of
common
daily
life
for
having
such
a
godmother
as
the
little
old
woman
clothed
in
grey
whose
name
is
well
i
leave
you
to
guess
nor
i
think
is
anybody
less
good
less
capable
of
both
work
and
enjoyment
in
after
life
for
having
been
a
little
unhappy
in
his
youth
as
the
prince
had
been
i
can
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
he
was
always
happy
now
who
is
or
that
he
had
no
cares
just
show
me
the
person
who
is
quite
free
from
them
but
whenever
people
worried
and
bothered
him
as
they
did
sometimes
with
state
etiquette
state
squabbles
and
the
like
setting
up
themselves
and
pulling
down
their
neighbours
he
would
take
refuge
in
that
upper
room
which
looked
out
on
the
beautiful
mountains
and
laying
his
head
on
his
godmother
shoulder
become
calmed
and
at
rest
also
she
helped
him
out
of
any
difficulty
which
now
and
then
occurred
for
there
never
was
such
a
wise
old
woman
when
the
people
of
nomansland
raised
the
alarm
as
sometimes
they
did
for
what
people
can
exist
without
a
little
and
began
to
cry
out
unhappy
is
the
nation
whose
king
is
a
child
she
would
say
to
him
gently
you
are
a
child
accept
the
fact
be
humble
be
teachable
lean
upon
the
wisdom
of
others
till
you
have
gained
your
own
he
did
so
he
learned
how
to
take
advice
before
attempting
to
give
it
to
obey
before
he
could
righteously
command
he
assembled
round
him
all
the
good
and
wise
of
his
kingdom
laid
all
its
affairs
before
them
and
was
guided
by
their
opinions
until
he
had
maturely
formed
his
own
this
he
did
sooner
than
anybody
would
have
imagined
who
did
not
know
of
his
godmother
and
his
two
secret
blessings
which
though
many
guessed
at
nobody
quite
understood
nor
did
they
understand
why
he
loved
so
the
little
upper
room
except
that
it
had
been
his
mother
room
from
the
window
of
which
as
people
remembered
now
she
had
used
to
sit
for
hours
watching
the
beautiful
mountains
out
of
that
window
he
used
to
fly
not
very
often
as
he
grew
older
the
labours
of
state
prevented
the
frequent
use
of
his
still
he
did
use
it
sometimes
only
now
it
was
less
for
his
own
pleasure
and
amusement
than
to
see
something
or
investigate
something
for
the
good
of
the
country
but
he
prized
his
godmother
gift
as
dearly
as
ever
it
was
a
comfort
to
him
in
all
his
vexations
an
enhancement
of
all
his
joys
it
made
him
almost
forget
his
lameness
which
was
never
cured
however
the
cruel
things
which
had
been
once
foreboded
of
him
did
not
happen
his
misfortune
was
not
such
a
heavy
one
after
all
it
proved
to
be
much
less
inconvenience
even
to
himself
than
had
been
feared
a
council
of
eminent
surgeons
and
mechanicians
invented
for
him
a
wonderful
pair
of
crutches
with
the
help
of
which
though
he
never
walked
easily
or
gracefully
he
did
manage
to
walk
so
as
to
be
quite
independent
and
such
was
the
love
his
people
bore
him
that
they
never
heard
the
sound
of
his
crutch
on
the
marble
without
a
leap
of
the
heart
for
they
knew
that
good
was
coming
to
them
whenever
he
approached
them
thus
though
he
never
walked
in
processions
never
reviewed
his
troops
mounted
on
a
magnificent
charger
nor
did
any
of
the
things
which
make
a
show
monarch
so
much
appreciated
he
was
able
for
all
the
duties
and
a
great
many
of
the
pleasures
of
his
rank
when
he
held
his
levées
not
standing
but
seated
on
a
throne
ingeniously
contrived
to
hide
his
infirmity
the
people
thronged
to
greet
him
when
he
drove
out
through
the
city
streets
shouts
followed
him
wherever
he
went
every
countenance
brightened
as
he
passed
and
his
own
perhaps
was
the
brightest
of
all
illustration
he
drove
out
through
the
city
streets
shouts
followed
him
wherever
he
first
because
accepting
his
affliction
as
inevitable
he
took
it
patiently
second
because
being
a
brave
man
he
bore
it
bravely
trying
to
forget
himself
and
live
out
of
himself
and
in
and
for
other
people
therefore
other
people
grew
to
love
him
so
well
that
i
think
hundreds
of
his
subjects
might
have
been
found
who
were
almost
ready
to
die
for
their
poor
lame
king
he
never
gave
them
a
queen
when
they
implored
him
to
choose
one
he
replied
that
his
country
was
his
bride
and
he
desired
no
other
but
perhaps
the
real
reason
was
that
he
shrank
from
any
change
and
that
no
wife
in
all
the
world
would
have
been
found
so
perfect
so
lovable
so
tender
to
him
in
all
his
weaknesses
as
his
beautiful
old
godmother
his
other
godfathers
and
godmothers
or
as
many
of
them
as
were
still
alive
crowded
round
him
as
soon
as
he
ascended
the
throne
he
was
very
civil
to
them
all
but
adopted
none
of
the
names
they
had
given
him
keeping
to
the
one
by
which
he
had
been
always
known
though
it
had
now
almost
lost
its
meaning
for
king
dolor
was
one
of
the
happiest
and
cheerfullest
men
alive
he
did
a
good
many
things
however
unlike
most
men
and
most
kings
which
a
little
astonished
his
subjects
first
he
pardoned
the
condemned
woman
who
had
been
his
nurse
and
ordained
that
from
henceforward
there
should
be
no
such
thing
as
the
punishment
of
death
in
nomansland
all
capital
criminals
were
to
be
sent
to
perpetual
imprisonment
in
hopeless
tower
and
the
plain
round
about
it
where
they
could
do
no
harm
to
anybody
and
might
in
time
do
a
little
good
as
the
woman
had
done
another
surprise
he
shortly
afterwards
gave
the
nation
he
recalled
his
uncle
family
who
had
fled
away
in
terror
to
another
country
and
restored
them
to
all
their
honours
in
their
own
he
chose
the
eldest
son
of
his
eldest
cousin
who
had
been
dead
a
year
and
had
him
educated
in
the
royal
palace
as
the
heir
to
the
throne
this
little
prince
was
a
quiet
unobtrusive
boy
so
that
everybody
wondered
at
the
king
choosing
him
when
there
were
so
many
more
but
as
he
grew
into
a
fine
young
fellow
good
and
brave
they
agreed
that
the
king
judged
more
wisely
than
they
not
a
lame
prince
neither
his
majesty
observed
one
day
watching
him
affectionately
for
he
was
the
best
runner
the
highest
leaper
the
keenest
and
most
active
sportsman
in
the
country
one
can
not
make
oneself
but
one
can
sometimes
help
a
little
in
the
making
of
somebody
else
it
is
well
this
was
said
not
to
any
of
his
great
lords
and
ladies
but
to
a
good
old
woman
his
first
homely
nurse
whom
he
had
sought
for
far
and
wide
and
at
last
found
in
her
cottage
among
the
beautiful
mountains
he
sent
for
her
to
visit
him
once
a
year
and
treated
her
with
great
honour
until
she
died
he
was
equally
kind
though
somewhat
less
tender
to
his
other
nurse
who
after
receiving
her
pardon
returned
to
her
native
town
and
grew
into
a
great
lady
and
i
hope
a
good
one
but
as
she
was
so
grand
a
personage
now
any
little
faults
she
had
did
not
show
illustration
as
she
was
so
grand
a
personage
now
any
little
faults
she
had
did
not
thus
king
dolor
reign
passed
year
after
year
long
and
prosperous
whether
he
was
happy
as
happy
as
a
king
is
a
question
no
human
being
can
decide
but
i
think
he
was
because
he
had
the
power
of
making
everybody
about
him
happy
and
did
it
too
also
because
he
was
his
godmother
godson
and
could
shut
himself
up
with
her
whenever
he
liked
in
that
quiet
little
room
in
view
of
the
beautiful
mountains
which
nobody
else
ever
saw
or
cared
to
see
they
were
too
far
off
and
the
city
lay
so
low
but
there
they
were
all
the
time
no
change
ever
came
to
them
and
i
think
at
any
day
throughout
his
long
reign
the
king
would
sooner
have
lost
his
crown
than
have
lost
sight
of
the
beautiful
mountains
in
course
of
time
when
the
little
prince
his
cousin
was
grown
into
a
tall
young
man
capable
of
all
the
duties
of
a
man
his
majesty
did
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
acts
ever
known
in
a
sovereign
beloved
by
his
people
and
prosperous
in
his
reign
he
announced
that
he
wished
to
invest
his
heir
with
the
royal
purple
at
any
rate
for
a
time
while
he
himself
went
away
on
a
distant
journey
whither
he
had
long
desired
to
go
everybody
marvelled
but
nobody
opposed
him
who
could
oppose
the
good
king
who
was
not
a
young
king
now
and
besides
the
nation
had
a
great
admiration
for
the
young
regent
and
possibly
a
lurking
pleasure
in
change
so
there
was
fixed
a
day
when
all
the
people
whom
it
would
hold
assembled
in
the
great
square
of
the
capital
to
see
the
young
prince
installed
solemnly
in
his
new
duties
and
undertaking
his
new
vows
he
was
a
very
fine
young
fellow
tall
and
straight
as
a
poplar
tree
with
a
frank
handsome
face
a
great
deal
handsomer
than
the
king
some
people
said
but
others
thought
differently
however
as
his
majesty
sat
on
his
throne
with
his
grey
hair
falling
from
underneath
his
crown
and
a
few
wrinkles
showing
in
spite
of
his
smile
there
was
something
about
his
countenance
which
made
his
people
even
while
they
shouted
regard
him
with
a
tenderness
mixed
with
awe
illustration
the
people
assembled
to
see
the
young
prince
installed
solemnly
in
his
new
duties
and
undertaking
his
new
he
lifted
up
his
thin
slender
hand
and
there
came
a
silence
over
the
vast
crowd
immediately
then
he
spoke
in
his
own
accustomed
way
using
no
grand
words
but
saying
what
he
had
to
say
in
the
simplest
fashion
though
with
a
clearness
that
struck
their
ears
like
the
first
song
of
a
bird
in
the
dusk
of
the
morning
my
people
i
am
tired
i
want
to
rest
i
have
had
a
long
reign
and
done
much
work
at
least
as
much
as
i
was
able
to
do
many
might
have
done
it
better
than
i
but
none
with
a
better
will
now
i
leave
it
to
others
i
am
tired
very
tired
let
me
go
home
there
rose
a
murmur
of
content
or
discontent
none
could
well
tell
then
it
died
down
again
and
the
assembly
listened
silently
once
more
i
am
not
anxious
about
you
my
people
my
children
continued
the
king
you
are
prosperous
and
at
peace
i
leave
you
in
good
hands
the
prince
regent
will
be
a
fitter
king
for
you
than
i
no
no
no
rose
the
universal
shout
and
those
who
had
sometimes
found
fault
with
him
shouted
louder
than
anybody
but
he
seemed
as
if
he
heard
them
not
yes
yes
said
he
as
soon
as
the
tumult
had
a
little
subsided
and
his
voice
sounded
firm
and
clear
and
some
very
old
people
who
boasted
of
having
seen
him
as
a
child
declared
that
his
face
took
a
sudden
change
and
grew
as
young
and
sweet
as
that
of
the
little
prince
dolor
yes
i
must
go
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
remember
me
sometimes
my
people
for
i
have
loved
you
well
and
i
am
going
a
long
way
and
i
do
not
think
i
shall
come
back
any
more
he
drew
a
little
bundle
out
of
his
breast
pocket
a
bundle
that
nobody
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
small
and
and
tied
up
with
many
knots
which
untied
themselves
in
an
instant
with
a
joyful
countenance
he
muttered
over
it
a
few
words
then
so
suddenly
that
even
those
nearest
to
his
majesty
could
not
tell
how
it
came
about
the
king
was
away
away
floating
right
up
in
the
air
upon
something
they
knew
not
what
except
that
it
appeared
to
be
as
safe
and
pleasant
as
the
wings
of
a
bird
and
after
him
sprang
a
bird
a
dear
little
lark
rising
from
whence
no
one
could
say
since
larks
do
not
usually
build
their
nests
in
the
pavement
of
city
squares
but
there
it
was
a
real
lark
singing
far
over
their
heads
louder
and
clearer
and
more
joyful
as
it
vanished
further
into
the
blue
sky
shading
their
eyes
and
straining
their
ears
the
astonished
people
stood
until
the
whole
vision
disappeared
like
a
speck
in
the
clouds
the
rosy
clouds
that
overhung
the
beautiful
mountains
then
they
guessed
that
they
should
see
their
beloved
king
no
more
as
he
was
he
had
always
been
somewhat
of
a
mystery
to
them
and
such
he
remained
but
they
went
home
and
accepting
their
new
monarch
obeyed
him
faithfully
for
his
cousin
sake
king
dolor
was
never
again
beheld
or
heard
of
in
his
own
country
but
the
good
he
had
done
there
lasted
for
years
and
years
he
was
long
missed
and
deeply
mourned
at
least
so
far
as
anybody
could
mourn
one
who
was
gone
on
such
a
happy
journey
whither
he
went
or
who
went
with
him
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
i
myself
believe
that
his
godmother
took
him
on
his
to
the
beautiful
mountains
what
he
did
there
or
where
he
is
now
who
can
tell
i
can
not
but
one
thing
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
wherever
he
is
he
is
perfectly
happy
and
so

i
think
of
him

story
of
the
author
life
the
author
of
this
little
book
dinah
maria
mulock
craik
was
a
woman
as
modest
sweet
and
wholesome
as
the
story
itself
she
lived
in
england
but
her
writings
endeared
her
to
people
all
over
the
world
some
american
ladies
who
went
to
call
upon
her
in
her
home
wildwood
cottage
in
hampstead
near
london
describe
her
as
wearing
a
black
silk
gown
with
a
plain
linen
collar
her
brown
hair
drawn
smoothly
back
from
an
open
brow
and
her
face
gracious
and
winning
to
an
unusual
degree
bearing
the
look
of
one
who
had
tasted
of
sorrow
this
was
when
she
was
already
a
writer
having
won
her
place
in
literature
by
hard
and
faithful
work
but
probably
she
did
not
dream
even
then
that
she
would
come
to
be
recognized
as
next
to
dickens
the
most
novelist
of
her
time
she
was
born
april
at
one
of
the
chief
manufacturing
towns
of
staffordshire
england
staffordshire
is
the
central
county
of
england
and
has
many
curious
and
interesting
features
it
forms
the
sloping
base
of
a
long
chain
of
hills
where
in
countless
ages
the
sea
sometimes
covering
the
land
and
again
driven
away
from
it
by
the
upheaval
of
a
great
body
of
earth
and
stone
has
worn
down
the
grit
and
limestone
rock
into
clay
did
you
know
that
all
clay
was
mud
made
by
the
washing
away
of
rocks
just
think
how
many
hundreds
of
years
it
took
to
make
the
little
ball
of
clay
you
model
with
well
the
people
who
lived
in
this
country
found
out
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
that
they
could
mould
their
clay
into
pots
and
basins
even
if
they
could
not
make
things
grow
in
it
so
they
dug
up
the
clay
shaped
it
with
their
hands
and
baked
it
in
the
sun
making
jars
bowls
and
other
useful
things
which
they
sold
to
farmers
in
exchange
for
food
about
that
time
there
came
marching
over
the
thickly
wooded
land
companies
of
roman
soldiers
who
took
all
the
clay
bowls
they
wanted
for
their
own
use
and
showed
the
potters
how
to
make
better
ones
they
also
compelled
them
to
make
floors
roofs
and
wall
ornaments
of
clay
baked
in
very
hot
ovens
called
kilns
much
of
this
old
roman
pottery
was
of
course
broken
and
lost
but
still
if
you
should
ever
go
there
you
would
find
pieces
of
it
in
the
banks
of
the
little
rivers
and
brooks
near
the
clay
pits
pieces
more
than
a
thousand
years
old
because
it
is
so
full
of
clay
dark
blue
clay
and
red
and
yellow
ochres
used
for
coloring
and
painting
as
well
as
red
and
black
chalk
the
country
seems
to
have
been
made
for
potteries
besides
this
there
used
always
to
be
plenty
of
wood
to
keep
the
kilns
hot
for
a
great
forest
covered
nearly
all
the
land
this
was
a
continuation
of
the
forest
of
arden
about
which
you
will
read
some
day
as
well
as
about
sherwood
forest
which
sheltered
robin
hood
and
his
merry
have
you
heard
about
them
yet
later
when
better
fuel
was
needed
two
great
coal
fields
were
discovered
underlying
the
county
one
of
them
twenty
miles
long
by
two
broad
here
then
where
all
was
so
perfectly
prepared
for
his
work
it
was
natural
that
the
greatest
potter
of
modern
times
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
all
times
should
be
born
josiah
wedgwood
who
lived
for
many
years
in
the
very
town
where
craik
was
born
he
not
only
loved
to
make
dishes
and
jars
of
all
kinds
as
perfect
as
possible
but
while
shut
in
with
a
long
illness
he
studied
the
chemistry
and
the
arithmetic
needed
in
his
trade
in
years
of
hard
labor
and
close
study
he
so
mastered
his
trade
that
he
made
it
both
a
science
and
an
art
he
more
than
any
other
turned
the
county
into
one
of
the
busiest
places
in
the
world
where
thousands
of
men
work
from
morning
till
night
to
supply
the
whole
world
with
every
sort
of
thing
that
can
be
made
out
of
clay
perhaps
on
the
bottom
of
your
plates
at
home
you
may
find
printed
the
words
staffordshire
england
before
wedgwood
time
in
to
be
accurate
was
a
small
group
of
thatched
houses
and
two
gathered
around
the
ancient
parish
church
in
years
after
birth
it
had
a
population
of
of
whom
were
employed
in
one
way
or
another
in
the
pottery
trade
the
whole
is
now
black
with
smoke
from
the
many
factories
at
one
time
when
the
potters
used
salt
to
glaze
their
ware
that
is
to
put
a
bright
polish
on
it
they
used
to
open
up
their
huge
ovens
every
saturday
morning
between
the
hours
of
eight
and
twelve
and
cast
in
salt
it
would
then
melt
and
run
over
the
surface
of
the
clay
jugs
and
things
inside
and
leave
a
smooth
shining
surface
if
you
let
some
salt
and
water
very
strong
of
salt
boil
over
an
old
crock
of
your
mother
when
the
fire
is
making
the
stove
you
will
see
how
it
works
indeed
it
was
through
an
accidental
of
this
sort
that
was
discovered
on
saturdays
when
the
salt
was
cast
into
the
kilns
it
made
great
clouds
of
smoke
and
vapor
filling
streets
and
houses
and
spreading
far
out
into
the
country
so
heavy
that
travelers
to
town
lost
their
way
and
persons
in
the
street
ran
against
each
other
here
lived
and
preached
and
argued
and
laid
down
the
law
a
brilliant
enthusiastic
irishman
named
thomas
mulock
the
father
of
the
woman
who
wrote
this
book
he
was
a
minister
but
one
who
did
not
agree
with
any
of
the
other
ministers
around
him
he
had
a
warm
eager
nature
and
a
temper
to
match
and
as
the
second
of
children
must
have
exercised
from
his
early
childhood
all
that
power
of
domineering
which
made
lord
byron
nickname
him
muley
mulock
by
this
name
he
was
known
over
half
of
europe
but
for
all
that
he
was
much
loved
and
admired
and
moved
in
the
same
circle
as
byron
scott
southey
and
wordsworth
from
him
craik
undoubtedly
inherited
her
gifts
as
a
writer
her
mother
was
a
daughter
of
mellard
a
tanner
and
a
member
of
the
reverend
thomas
mulock
congregation
she
was
one
of
three
sisters
who
used
to
talk
with
the
young
minister
over
the
wall
that
separated
their
gardens
there
is
a
legend
that
he
went
all
in
white
to
the
wedding
his
shoes
being
of
white
satin
but
this
is
very
likely
only
a
picturesque
bit
of
gossip
kept
alive
by
the
fact
that
mulock
was
quite
romantic
enough
and
independent
enough
to
have
done
such
a
thing
if
it
had
happened
to
strike
his
fancy
his
wife
was
a
frail
little
woman
and
the
troubles
which
soon
beset
her
husband
on
account
of
his
strong
new
opinions
were
hard
for
her
to
bear
as
was
also
the
way
in
which
he
like
a
irishman
sure
that
he
was
right
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
wrong
marched
straight
into
the
thick
of
any
theological
fight
that
might
be
going
on
dinah
at
last
although
merely
an
inexperienced
girl
persuaded
her
mother
to
go
with
her
to
london
to
seek
a
little
peace
and
quiet
leaving
the
father
to
fight
out
his
battles
alone
in
the
country
place
he
found
or
made
so
full
of
strife
this
was
a
tremendous
responsibility
for
a
young
girl
with
no
means
to
speak
of
and
only
an
ordinarily
good
education
such
as
was
given
to
young
ladies
in
the
girls
schools
of
those
days
at
school
she
seems
to
have
been
a
great
favorite
and
is
described
as
being
always
the
center
of
a
bevy
of
girls
who
hung
round
her
lovingly
and
for
whom
she
prophesied
the
most
wonderful
things
she
was
always
sure
they
had
great
abilities
but
seemed
to
be
quite
unconscious
that
she
herself
was
the
most
gifted
of
them
all
and
would
be
remembered
when
they
were
forgotten
even
after
she
came
to
london
she
made
friends
among
other
girls
and
in
spite
of
her
unceasing
and
exacting
work
seems
always
to
have
had
time
to
enjoy
them
and
make
them
enjoy
her
she
was
only
twenty
years
old
when
in
she
went
to
london
and
undertook
the
main
support
of
her
mother
and
the
two
young
brothers
who
soon
joined
them
she
did
everything
her
pen
could
find
to
do
writing
stories
for
fashion
books
and
other
periodicals
and
had
the
satisfaction
finally
of
knowing
that
she
had
succeeded
in
caring
for
her
aged
mother
to
the
end
of
her
life
of
the
two
brothers
the
elder
thomas
true
son
of
his
father
took
part
in
some
act
of
rebellion
while
studying
at
the
royal
academy
his
father
sided
with
the
principals
of
the
school
and
approved
of
the
son
being
expelled
his
own
heart
aching
most
probably
while
he
did
what
he
thought
was
his
duty
the
son
heart
in
turn
was
sore
at
what
he
must
have
thought
unloving
conduct
on
the
father
part
at
any
rate
he
decided
soon
after
to
go
to
australia
and
as
he
was
about
to
board
the
ship
fell
off
the
quay
and
was
killed
this
was
a
heavy
blow
to
the
brave
young
sister
now
left
with
only
the
younger
brother
he
was
a
musician
and
a
photographer
of
no
mean
rank
at
a
time
when
few
persons
thought
of
photography
as
an
art
though
he
never
proved
a
support
to
her
always
leaning
on
her
motherly
care
and
getting
himself
into
many
scrapes
from
which
she
had
to
pull
him
out
he
was
nevertheless
the
joy
of
his
sister
life
in
london
miss
mulock
made
friends
whose
assistance
later
was
worth
a
great
deal
to
her
she
had
published
in
her
first
novel
which
brought
her
recognition
and
made
men
and
women
of
real
power
in
the
world
of
letters
seek
her
out
when
they
knew
her
personally
her
simple
cordiality
friendliness
and
above
all
her
thorough
goodness
of
heart
made
them
her
warm
friends
when
she
found
herself
able
to
take
a
cottage
the
wildwood
cottage
already
spoken
of
she
quickly
gathered
around
her
some
of
the
brightest
and
best
people
in
the
great
city
from
that
time
on
her
books
came
out
steadily
and
in
great
numbers
in
all
she
wrote
works
including
many
novels
some
essays
and
two
or
three
volumes
of
poetry
the
greatest
of
her
novels
is
halifax
considered
by
many
the
best
story
of
english
life
ever
written
this
novel
was
translated
into
french
german
italian
greek
and
russian
and
is
still
one
of
the
most
frequently
called
for
books
in
the
public
libraries
her
poems
douglas
tender
and
and
my
are
known
wherever
english
is
spoken
there
is
an
interesting
story
connected
with
the
latter
poem
philip
bourke
marston
the
boy
to
whom
it
refers
was
the
son
of
one
of
miss
mulock
london
friends
westland
marston
a
famous
dramatic
poet
and
critic
when
his
little
son
was
born
august
he
asked
miss
mulock
to
be
philip
godmother
and
traces
of
her
deep
affection
for
the
gifted
child
are
to
be
found
among
her
writings
was
written
for
him
and
it
is
to
him
evidently
that
the
lovely
little
poem
child
refers
the
boy
lost
his
sight
when
only
three
years
old
the
cause
is
said
to
have
been
too
much
belladonna
given
to
prevent
scarlet
fever
for
many
years
enough
sight
remained
to
enable
him
in
his
own
words
to
see
the
three
boughs
waving
in
the
wind
the
pageant
of
sunset
in
the
west
and
the
glimmer
of
a
fire
upon
the
hearth
shut
in
thus
to
the
inner
world
of
thought
and
feeling
philip
indulged
in
an
imaginative
series
of
wonderful
adventures
and
in
long
daydreams
excited
by
music
perhaps
his
blindness
coupled
with
his
vivid
imagination
is
the
reason
why
the
beautiful
poems
he
wrote
when
he
grew
older
show
such
a
wonderfully
vivid
power
of
portraying
nature
when
he
saw
a
waving
in
the
wind
he
saw
it
only
dimly
with
his
outward
eyes
but
as
he
sat
dreaming
over
it
afterward
it
became
more
real
to
him
than
any
bough
was
likely
to
become
to
an
everyday
hearty
boy
who
saw
so
many
trees
with
so
many
branches
that
he
hardly
noticed
them
at
all
it
must
have
been
a
great
comfort
to
him
to
have
such
a
godmother
as
miss
mulock
a
real
fairy
godmother
who
could
weave
magic
spells
of
the
most
interesting
stories
and
heal
the
aches
of
his
poor
heart
by
sweet
little
poems
it
was
at
wildwood
cottage
that
miss
mulock
formed
that
close
acquaintance
with
george
lillie
craik
that
finally
led
to
her
marriage
with
him
craik
met
with
a
serious
railroad
accident
near
her
house
which
she
promptly
gave
up
to
him
she
staying
with
a
friend
near
by
in
the
long
days
of
convalescence
they
learned
to
know
each
other
thoroughly
the
marriage
was
singularly
happy
craik
was
a
man
of
letters
as
well
as
a
publisher
and
they
had
every
taste
in
common
their
life
together
was
beautiful
and
full
of
a
deep
peace
although
they
had
no
children
of
their
own
they
had
an
adopted
daughter
dorothy
and
she
it
is
for
whom
adventures
of
a
was
written
it
is
probably
because
of
craik
devotion
and
love
for
her
that
the
little
book
is
so
free
from
so
evidently
written
wholeheartedly
as
told
to
my
child
craik
death
which
took
place
in
was
like
her
life
full
of
affection
and
obedience
to
duty
she
had
not
been
ill
beyond
a
few
attacks
of
that
no
one
considered
serious
by
some
blessed
chance
on
the
morning
of
her
last
day
on
earth
her
husband
took
an
especially
loving
farewell
of
her
so
much
so
that
dorothy
laughed
at
him
and
craik
smiling
happily
reminded
her
that
although
they
had
been
so
long
married
they
were
lovers
still
it
was
within
a
few
weeks
of
dorothy
marriage
when
the
sudden
heart
failure
came
and
craik
one
wish
was
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
live
four
weeks
longer
so
that
her
death
might
not
overshadow
her
daughter
wedding
she
resigned
even
this
unselfish
wish
when
she
saw
that
it
was
not
god
will
the
beauty
of
her
character
it
may
be
supposed
quite
as
much
as
any
peculiar
merit
in
her
writings
led
queen
victoria
who
always
tried
to
reward
uprightness
of
life
as
well
as
unusual
skill
in
any
art
to
bestow
upon
craik
the
only
mark
of
recognition
in
her
power
this
was
a
small
pension
and
although
she
often
was
criticised
for
keeping
a
sum
of
money
she
did
not
need
while
many
less
fortunate
writers
did
need
it
she
retained
it
as
her
right
to
use
as
her
conscience
dictated
she
set
it
aside
for
struggling
authors
who
would
accept
help
from
the
queen
bounty
that
they
would
refuse
from
her
private
funds
other
writers
may
be
more
brilliant
and
more
profound
than
craik
but
her
tales
of
simple
goodness
bring
not
only
a
sense
of
rest
and
relief
to
the
reader
but
also
a
new
desire
to
put
goodness
into
his
own
daily
life
in
all
her
stories
craik
makes
goodness
as
lovely
as
it
really
is
there
are
sad
things
in
them
but
the
sadness
is
always
made
sweet
at
last
by
courage
and
patience
and
kindliness
