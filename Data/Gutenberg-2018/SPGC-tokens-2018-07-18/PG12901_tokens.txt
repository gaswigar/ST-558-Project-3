chapter
i
the
gun
club
during
the
federal
war
in
the
united
states
a
new
and
very
influential
club
was
established
in
the
city
of
baltimore
maryland
it
is
well
known
with
what
energy
the
military
instinct
was
developed
amongst
that
nation
of
shipowners
shopkeepers
and
mechanics
mere
tradesmen
jumped
their
counters
to
become
extempore
captains
colonels
and
generals
without
having
passed
the
military
school
at
west
point
they
soon
rivalled
their
colleagues
of
the
old
continent
and
like
them
gained
victories
by
dint
of
lavishing
bullets
millions
and
men
but
where
americans
singularly
surpassed
europeans
was
in
the
science
of
ballistics
or
of
throwing
massive
weapons
by
the
use
of
an
engine
not
that
their
arms
attained
a
higher
degree
of
perfection
but
they
were
of
unusual
dimensions
and
consequently
of
hitherto
unknown
ranges
the
english
french
and
prussians
have
nothing
to
learn
about
flank
running
enfilading
or
firing
but
their
cannon
howitzers
and
mortars
are
mere
compared
with
the
formidable
engines
of
american
artillery
this
fact
ought
to
astonish
no
one
the
yankees
the
first
mechanicians
in
the
world
are
born
engineers
just
as
italians
are
musicians
and
germans
metaphysicians
thence
nothing
more
natural
than
to
see
them
bring
their
audacious
ingenuity
to
bear
on
the
science
of
ballistics
hence
those
gigantic
cannon
much
less
useful
than
but
quite
as
astonishing
and
much
more
admired
the
marvels
of
this
style
by
parrott
dahlgren
and
rodman
are
well
known
there
was
nothing
left
the
armstrongs
pallisers
and
treuille
de
beaulieux
but
to
bow
before
their
transatlantic
rivals
therefore
during
the
terrible
struggle
between
northerners
and
southerners
artillerymen
were
in
great
request
the
union
newspapers
published
their
inventions
with
enthusiasm
and
there
was
no
little
tradesman
nor
booby
who
did
not
bother
his
head
day
and
night
with
calculations
about
impossible
trajectory
engines
now
when
an
american
has
an
idea
he
seeks
another
american
to
share
it
if
they
are
three
they
elect
a
president
and
two
secretaries
given
four
they
elect
a
clerk
and
a
company
is
established
five
convoke
a
general
meeting
and
the
club
is
formed
it
thus
happened
at
baltimore
the
first
man
who
invented
a
new
cannon
took
into
partnership
the
first
man
who
cast
it
and
the
first
man
that
bored
it
such
was
the
nucleus
of
the
gun
club
one
month
after
its
formation
it
numbered
eighteen
hundred
and
effective
members
and
thirty
thousand
five
hundred
and
corresponding
members
one
condition
was
imposed
as
a
qu√¢
upon
every
one
who
wished
to
become
a
member
that
of
having
invented
or
at
least
perfected
a
cannon
or
in
default
of
a
cannon
a
firearm
of
some
sort
but
to
tell
the
truth
mere
inventors
of
rifles
revolvers
or
did
not
enjoy
much
consideration
artillerymen
were
always
preferred
to
them
in
every
circumstance
the
estimation
in
which
they
are
held
said
one
day
a
learned
orator
of
the
gun
club
is
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
their
cannon
and
in
direct
ratio
to
the
square
of
distance
attained
by
their
projectiles
a
little
more
and
it
would
have
been
newton
law
of
gravitation
applied
to
moral
order
once
the
gun
club
founded
it
can
be
easily
imagined
its
effect
upon
the
inventive
genius
of
the
americans
took
colossal
proportions
and
projectiles
launched
beyond
permitted
distances
cut
inoffensive
pedestrians
to
pieces
all
these
inventions
left
the
timid
instruments
of
european
artillery
far
behind
them
this
may
be
estimated
by
the
following
figures
formerly
in
the
good
old
times
a
pounder
at
a
distance
of
three
hundred
feet
would
cut
up
horses
attacked
in
flank
and
men
the
art
was
then
in
its
infancy
projectiles
have
since
made
their
way
the
rodman
gun
that
sent
a
projectile
weighing
half
a
ton
a
distance
of
seven
miles
could
easily
have
cut
up
a
hundred
and
fifty
horses
and
three
hundred
men
there
was
some
talk
at
the
gun
club
of
making
a
solemn
experiment
with
it
but
if
the
horses
consented
to
play
their
part
the
men
unfortunately
were
wanting
however
that
may
be
the
effect
of
these
cannon
was
very
deadly
and
at
each
discharge
the
combatants
fell
like
ears
before
a
scythe
after
such
projectiles
what
signified
the
famous
ball
which
at
coutras
in
disabled
men
and
the
one
which
at
zorndorff
in
killed
forty
fantassins
and
in
kesseldorf
austrian
cannon
of
which
every
shot
levelled
seventy
enemies
with
the
ground
what
was
the
astonishing
firing
at
jena
or
austerlitz
which
decided
the
fate
of
the
battle
during
the
federal
war
much
more
wonderful
things
had
been
seen
at
the
battle
of
gettysburg
a
conical
projectile
thrown
by
a
cut
up
a
hundred
and
confederates
and
at
the
passage
of
the
potomac
a
rodman
ball
sent
two
hundred
and
fifteen
southerners
into
an
evidently
better
world
a
formidable
mortar
must
also
be
mentioned
invented
by
maston
a
distinguished
member
and
perpetual
secretary
of
the
gun
club
the
result
of
which
was
far
more
deadly
seeing
that
at
its
trial
shot
it
killed
three
hundred
and
persons
by
bursting
it
is
true
what
can
be
added
to
these
figures
so
eloquent
in
themselves
nothing
so
the
following
calculation
obtained
by
the
statistician
pitcairn
will
be
admitted
without
contestation
by
dividing
the
number
of
victims
fallen
under
the
projectiles
by
that
of
the
members
of
the
gun
club
he
found
that
each
one
of
them
had
killed
on
his
own
account
an
average
of
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
men
and
a
fraction
by
considering
such
a
result
it
will
be
seen
that
the
single
preoccupation
of
this
learned
society
was
the
destruction
of
humanity
philanthropically
and
the
perfecting
of
firearms
considered
as
instruments
of
civilisation
it
was
a
company
of
exterminating
angels
at
bottom
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
it
must
be
added
that
these
yankees
brave
as
they
have
ever
proved
themselves
did
not
confine
themselves
to
formulae
but
sacrificed
themselves
to
their
theories
amongst
them
might
be
counted
officers
of
every
rank
those
who
had
just
made
their
in
the
profession
of
arms
and
those
who
had
grown
old
on
their
many
whose
names
figured
in
the
book
of
honour
of
the
gun
club
remained
on
the
field
of
battle
and
of
those
who
came
back
the
greater
part
bore
marks
of
their
indisputable
valour
crutches
wooden
legs
articulated
arms
hands
with
hooks
jaws
silver
craniums
platinum
noses
nothing
was
wanting
to
the
collection
and
the
pitcairn
likewise
calculated
that
in
the
gun
club
there
was
not
quite
one
arm
amongst
every
four
persons
and
only
two
legs
amongst
six
but
these
valiant
artillerymen
paid
little
heed
to
such
small
matters
and
felt
justly
proud
when
the
report
of
a
battle
stated
the
number
of
victims
at
tenfold
the
quantity
of
projectiles
expended
one
day
however
a
sad
and
lamentable
day
peace
was
signed
by
the
survivors
of
the
war
the
noise
of
firing
gradually
ceased
the
mortars
were
silent
the
howitzers
were
muzzled
for
long
enough
and
the
cannon
with
muzzles
depressed
were
stored
in
the
arsenals
the
shots
were
piled
up
in
the
parks
the
bloody
reminiscences
were
effaced
cotton
shrubs
grew
magnificently
on
the
fields
mourning
garments
began
to
be
as
well
as
sorrow
and
the
gun
club
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
certain
old
hands
inveterate
workers
still
went
on
with
their
calculations
in
ballistics
they
still
imagined
gigantic
bombs
and
unparalleled
howitzers
but
what
was
the
use
of
vain
theories
that
could
not
be
put
in
practice
so
the
saloons
were
deserted
the
servants
slept
in
the
antechambers
the
newspapers
grew
mouldy
on
the
tables
from
dark
corners
issued
sad
snores
and
the
members
of
the
gun
club
formerly
so
noisy
now
reduced
to
silence
by
the
disastrous
peace
slept
the
sleep
of
platonic
artillery
this
is
distressing
said
brave
tom
hunter
whilst
his
wooden
legs
were
carbonising
at
the
fireplace
of
the
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
look
forward
to
what
a
tiresome
existence
where
is
the
time
when
cannon
awoke
you
every
morning
with
its
joyful
reports
that
time
is
over
answered
dandy
bilsby
trying
to
stretch
the
arms
he
had
lost
there
was
some
fun
then
you
invented
an
howitzer
and
it
was
hardly
cast
before
you
ran
to
try
it
on
the
enemy
then
you
went
back
to
the
camp
with
an
encouragement
from
sherman
or
a
shake
of
the
hands
from
macclellan
but
now
the
generals
have
gone
back
to
their
counters
and
instead
of
they
expedite
inoffensive
cotton
bales
ah
by
saint
barb
the
future
of
artillery
is
lost
to
america
yes
bilsby
cried
colonel
blomsberry
it
is
too
bad
one
fine
morning
you
leave
your
tranquil
occupations
you
are
drilled
in
the
use
of
arms
you
leave
baltimore
for
the
you
conduct
yourself
like
a
hero
and
in
two
years
three
years
at
the
latest
you
are
obliged
to
leave
the
fruit
of
so
many
fatigues
to
go
to
sleep
in
deplorable
idleness
and
keep
your
hands
in
your
pockets
the
valiant
colonel
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
give
such
a
proof
of
his
want
of
occupation
though
it
was
not
the
pockets
that
were
wanting
and
no
war
in
prospect
then
said
the
famous
maston
scratching
his
cranium
with
his
steel
hook
there
is
not
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
now
that
there
is
so
much
to
do
in
the
science
of
artillery
i
myself
finished
this
very
morning
a
diagram
with
plan
basin
and
elevation
of
a
mortar
destined
to
change
the
laws
of
warfare
indeed
replied
tom
hunter
thinking
involuntarily
of
the
honourable
maston
last
essay
indeed
answered
maston
but
what
is
the
use
of
the
good
results
of
such
studies
and
so
many
difficulties
conquered
it
is
mere
waste
of
time
the
people
of
the
new
world
seem
determined
to
live
in
peace
and
our
bellicose
has
gone
as
far
as
to
predict
approaching
catastrophes
due
to
the
scandalous
increase
of
population
yet
maston
said
colonel
blomsberry
they
are
always
fighting
in
europe
to
maintain
the
principle
of
nationalities
what
of
that
why
there
might
be
something
to
do
over
there
and
if
they
accepted
our
services
what
are
you
thinking
of
cried
bilsby
work
at
ballistics
for
the
benefit
of
foreigners
perhaps
that
would
be
better
than
not
doing
it
at
all
answered
the
colonel
doubtless
said
maston
it
would
be
better
but
such
an
expedient
can
not
be
thought
of
why
so
asked
the
colonel
because
their
ideas
of
advancement
would
be
contrary
to
all
our
american
customs
those
folks
seem
to
think
that
you
can
not
be
a
without
having
served
as
second
lieutenant
which
comes
to
the
same
as
saying
that
no
one
can
point
a
gun
that
has
not
cast
one
now
that
is
simply
absurd
replied
tom
hunter
whittling
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
and
as
things
are
so
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
plant
tobacco
or
distil
what
shouted
maston
shall
we
not
employ
these
last
years
of
our
existence
in
perfecting
firearms
will
not
a
fresh
opportunity
present
itself
to
try
the
ranges
of
our
projectiles
will
the
atmosphere
be
no
longer
illuminated
by
the
lightning
of
our
cannons
wo
some
international
difficulty
crop
up
that
will
allow
us
to
declare
war
against
some
transatlantic
power
wo
france
run
down
one
of
our
steamers
or
wo
england
in
defiance
of
the
rights
of
nations
hang
up
three
or
four
of
our
countrymen
no
maston
answered
colonel
blomsberry
no
such
luck
no
not
one
of
those
incidents
will
happen
and
if
one
did
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
us
american
sensitiveness
is
declining
daily
and
we
are
going
to
the
dogs
yes
we
are
growing
quite
humble
replied
bilsby
and
we
are
humiliated
answered
tom
hunter
all
that
is
only
too
true
replied
maston
with
fresh
vehemence
there
are
a
thousand
reasons
for
fighting
floating
about
and
still
we
do
fight
we
economise
legs
and
arms
and
that
to
the
profit
of
folks
that
do
know
what
to
do
with
them
look
here
without
looking
any
farther
for
a
motive
for
war
did
not
north
america
formerly
belong
to
the
english
doubtless
answered
tom
hunter
angrily
poking
the
fire
with
the
end
of
his
crutch
well
replied
maston
why
should
not
england
in
its
turn
belong
to
the
americans
it
would
be
but
justice
answered
colonel
blomsberry
go
and
propose
that
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
cried
maston
and
see
what
sort
of
a
reception
you
would
get
it
would
not
be
a
bad
reception
murmured
bilsby
between
the
four
teeth
he
had
saved
from
battle
cried
maston
they
need
not
count
upon
my
vote
in
the
next
elections
nor
upon
ours
answered
with
common
accord
these
bellicose
invalids
in
the
meantime
continued
maston
and
to
conclude
if
they
do
not
furnish
me
with
the
opportunity
of
trying
my
new
mortar
on
a
real
i
shall
send
in
my
resignation
as
member
of
the
gun
club
and
i
shall
go
and
bury
myself
in
the
backwoods
of
arkansas
we
will
follow
you
there
answered
the
interlocutors
of
the
enterprising
maston
things
had
come
to
that
pass
and
the
club
getting
more
excited
was
menaced
with
approaching
dissolution
when
an
unexpected
event
came
to
prevent
so
regrettable
a
catastrophe
the
very
day
after
the
foregoing
conversation
each
member
of
the
club
received
a
circular
couched
in
these
terms
baltimore
october
the
president
of
the
gun
club
has
the
honour
to
inform
his
colleagues
that
at
the
meeting
on
the
ultimo
he
will
make
them
a
communication
of
an
extremely
interesting
nature
he
therefore
begs
that
they
to
the
suspension
of
all
other
business
will
attend
in
accordance
with
the
present
invitation
their
devoted
colleague
impey
barbicane
chapter
ii
president
barbicane
communication
on
the
of
october
at
a
dense
crowd
pressed
into
the
saloons
of
the
gun
club
all
the
members
of
the
club
residing
at
baltimore
had
gone
on
the
invitation
of
their
president
the
express
brought
corresponding
members
by
hundreds
and
if
the
had
not
been
so
large
the
crowd
of
could
not
have
found
room
in
it
they
overflowed
into
the
neighbouring
rooms
down
the
passages
and
even
into
the
courtyards
there
they
ran
against
the
populace
who
were
pressing
against
the
doors
each
trying
to
get
into
the
front
rank
all
eager
to
learn
the
important
communication
of
president
barbicane
all
pressing
squeezing
crushing
with
that
liberty
of
action
peculiar
to
the
masses
brought
up
in
the
idea
of
that
evening
any
stranger
who
might
have
chanced
to
be
in
baltimore
could
not
have
obtained
a
place
at
any
price
in
the
large
hall
it
was
exclusively
reserved
to
residing
or
corresponding
members
no
one
else
was
admitted
and
the
city
magnates
common
councillors
and
select
men
were
compelled
to
mingle
with
their
inferiors
in
order
to
catch
stray
news
from
the
interior
the
immense
hall
presented
a
curious
spectacle
it
was
marvellously
adapted
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
built
lofty
pillars
formed
of
cannon
superposed
upon
huge
mortars
as
a
base
supported
the
fine
ironwork
of
the
arches
real
lacework
trophies
of
blunderbusses
matchlocks
arquebuses
carbines
all
sorts
of
ancient
or
modern
firearms
were
picturesquely
enlaced
against
the
walls
the
gas
in
full
flame
came
out
of
a
thousand
revolvers
grouped
in
the
form
of
lustres
whilst
candlesticks
of
pistols
and
candelabra
made
of
guns
done
up
in
sheaves
completed
this
display
of
light
models
of
cannons
specimens
of
bronze
targets
spotted
with
plaques
broken
by
the
shock
of
the
gun
club
balls
assortments
of
rammers
and
sponges
chaplets
of
shells
necklaces
of
projectiles
garlands
of
howitzers
in
a
word
all
the
tools
of
the
artilleryman
surprised
the
eyes
by
their
wonderful
arrangement
and
induced
a
belief
that
their
real
purpose
was
more
ornamental
than
deadly
in
the
place
of
honour
was
seen
covered
by
a
splendid
glass
case
a
piece
of
breech
broken
and
twisted
under
the
effort
of
the
powder
a
precious
fragment
of
maston
cannon
at
the
extremity
of
the
hall
the
president
assisted
by
four
secretaries
occupied
a
wide
platform
his
chair
placed
on
a
carved
was
modelled
upon
the
powerful
proportions
of
a
mortar
it
was
pointed
at
an
angle
of
and
hung
upon
trunnions
so
that
the
president
could
use
it
as
a
very
agreeable
in
great
heat
upon
the
desk
a
huge
iron
plate
supported
upon
six
carronades
stood
a
very
tasteful
inkstand
made
of
a
spanish
piece
and
a
which
when
required
went
off
like
a
revolver
during
the
vehement
discussions
this
new
sort
of
bell
scarcely
sufficed
to
cover
the
voices
of
this
legion
of
excited
artillerymen
in
front
of
the
desk
benches
arranged
in
zigzags
like
the
circumvallations
of
intrenchment
formed
a
succession
of
bastions
and
curtains
where
the
members
of
the
gun
club
took
their
seats
and
that
evening
it
may
be
said
there
were
plenty
on
the
ramparts
the
president
was
sufficiently
known
for
all
to
be
assured
that
he
would
not
have
called
together
his
colleagues
without
a
very
great
motive
impey
barbicane
was
a
man
of
forty
calm
cold
austere
of
a
singularly
serious
and
concentrated
mind
as
exact
as
a
chronometer
of
an
imperturbable
temperament
and
immovable
character
not
very
chivalrous
yet
adventurous
and
always
bringing
practical
ideas
to
bear
on
the
wildest
enterprises
an
essential
a
northern
colonist
the
descendant
of
those
roundheads
so
fatal
to
the
stuarts
and
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
southern
gentlemen
the
ancient
cavaliers
of
the
mother
country
in
a
word
a
yankee
cast
in
a
single
mould
barbicane
had
made
a
great
fortune
as
a
named
director
of
artillery
during
the
war
he
showed
himself
fertile
in
inventions
enterprising
in
his
ideas
he
contributed
powerfully
to
the
progress
of
ballistics
gave
an
immense
impetus
to
experimental
researches
he
was
a
person
of
average
height
having
by
a
rare
exception
in
the
gun
club
all
his
limbs
intact
his
features
seemed
to
be
drawn
by
square
and
rule
and
if
it
be
true
that
in
order
to
guess
the
instincts
of
a
man
one
must
look
at
his
profile
barbicane
seen
thus
offered
the
most
certain
indications
of
energy
audacity
and
at
that
moment
he
remained
motionless
in
his
chair
mute
absorbed
with
an
inward
look
sheltered
under
his
tall
hat
a
cylinder
of
black
silk
which
seems
screwed
down
upon
the
skull
of
american
men
his
colleagues
talked
noisily
around
him
without
disturbing
him
they
questioned
one
another
launched
into
the
field
of
suppositions
examined
their
president
and
tried
but
in
vain
to
make
out
the
of
his
imperturbable
physiognomy
just
as
eight
struck
from
the
fulminating
clock
of
the
large
hall
barbicane
as
if
moved
by
a
spring
jumped
up
a
general
silence
ensued
and
the
orator
in
a
slightly
emphatic
tone
spoke
as
follows
brave
colleagues
it
is
some
time
since
an
unfruitful
peace
plunged
the
members
of
the
gun
club
into
deplorable
inactivity
after
a
period
of
some
years
so
full
of
incidents
we
have
been
obliged
to
abandon
our
works
and
stop
short
on
the
road
of
progress
i
do
not
fear
to
proclaim
aloud
that
any
war
which
would
put
arms
in
our
hands
again
would
be
welcome
yes
war
cried
impetuous
maston
hear
hear
was
heard
on
every
side
but
war
said
barbicane
war
is
impossible
under
actual
circumstances
and
whatever
my
honourable
interrupter
may
hope
long
years
will
elapse
before
our
cannons
thunder
on
a
field
of
battle
we
must
therefore
make
up
our
minds
to
it
and
seek
in
another
order
of
ideas
food
for
the
activity
by
which
we
are
devoured
the
assembly
felt
that
its
president
was
coming
to
the
delicate
point
it
redoubled
its
attention
a
few
months
ago
my
brave
colleagues
continued
barbicane
i
asked
myself
if
whilst
still
remaining
in
our
speciality
we
could
not
undertake
some
grand
experiment
worthy
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
if
the
progress
of
ballistics
would
not
allow
us
to
execute
it
with
success
i
have
therefore
sought
worked
calculated
and
the
conviction
has
resulted
from
my
studies
that
we
must
succeed
in
an
enterprise
that
would
seem
impracticable
in
any
other
country
this
project
elaborated
at
length
will
form
the
subject
of
my
communication
it
is
worthy
of
you
worthy
of
the
gun
club
past
history
and
can
not
fail
to
make
a
noise
in
the
world
much
noise
cried
a
passionate
artilleryman
much
noise
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
answered
barbicane
do
interrupt
repeated
several
voices
i
therefore
beg
of
you
my
brave
colleagues
resumed
the
president
to
grant
me
all
your
attention
a
shudder
ran
through
the
assembly
barbicane
having
with
a
rapid
gesture
firmly
fixed
his
hat
on
his
head
continued
his
speech
in
a
calm
tone
there
is
not
one
of
you
brave
colleagues
who
has
not
seen
the
moon
or
at
least
heard
of
it
do
not
be
astonished
if
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
the
queen
of
night
it
is
perhaps
our
lot
to
be
the
columbuses
of
this
unknown
world
understand
me
and
second
me
as
much
as
you
can
i
will
lead
you
to
its
conquest
and
its
name
shall
be
joined
to
those
of
the
states
that
form
the
grand
country
of
the
union
hurrah
for
the
moon
cried
the
gun
club
with
one
voice
the
moon
has
been
much
studied
resumed
barbicane
its
mass
density
weight
volume
constitution
movements
distance
the
part
it
plays
in
the
solar
world
are
all
perfectly
determined
selenographic

have
been
drawn
with
a
perfection
that
equals
if
it
does
not
surpass
those
of
terrestrial
maps
photography
has
given
to
our
satellite
proofs
of
incomparable
beauty
in
a
word
all
that
the
sciences
of
mathematics
astronomy
geology
and
optics
can
teach
is
known
about
the
moon
but
until
now
no
direct
communication
with
it
has
ever
been
established
a
violent
movement
of
interest
and
surprise
welcomed
this
sentence
of
the
orator
allow
me
he
resumed
to
recall
to
you
in
few
words
how
certain
ardent
minds
embarked
upon
imaginary
journeys
pretended
to
have
penetrated
the
secrets
of
our
satellite
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
certain
david
fabricius
boasted
of
having
seen
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
with
his
own
eyes
in
a
frenchman
jean
baudoin
published
his
to
the
moon
by
dominique
gonzales
spanish
at
the
same
epoch
cyrano
de
bergerac
published
the
celebrated
expedition
that
had
so
much
success
in
france
later
on
another
frenchman
that
nation
took
a
great
deal
of
notice
of
the
moon
named
fontenelle
wrote
his
of
a
masterpiece
of
his
time
but
science
in
its
progress
crushes
even
masterpieces
about
a
pamphlet
translated
from
the
york
related
that
sir
john
herschel
sent
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
there
to
make
astronomical
observations
had
by
means
of
a
telescope
perfected
by
interior
lighting
brought
the
moon
to
within
a
distance
of
eighty
yards
then
he
distinctly
perceived
caverns
in
which
lived
hippopotami
green
mountains
with
golden
borders
sheep
with
ivory
horns
white
deer
and
inhabitants
with
membraneous
wings
like
those
of
bats
this
treatise
the
work
of
an
american
named
locke
had
a
very
great
success
but
it
was
soon
found
out
that
it
was
a
scientific
mystification
and
frenchmen
were
the
first
to
laugh
at
it
laugh
at
an
american
cried
maston
but
that
a
be
comforted
my
worthy
friend
before
frenchmen
laughed
they
were
completely
taken
in
by
our
countryman
to
terminate
this
rapid
history
i
may
add
that
a
certain
hans
pfaal
of
rotterdam
went
up
in
a
balloon
filled
with
a
gas
made
from
azote
times
lighter
than
hydrogen
and
reached
the
moon
after
a
journey
of
nineteen
days
this
journey
like
the
preceding
attempts
was
purely
imaginary
but
it
was
the
work
of
a
popular
american
writer
of
a
strange
and
contemplative
genius
i
have
named
edgar
poe
hurrah
for
edgar
poe
cried
the
assembly
electrified
by
the
words
of
the
president
i
have
now
come
to
an
end
of
these
attempts
which
i
may
call
purely
literary
and
quite
insufficient
to
establish
any
serious
communications
with
the
queen
of
night
however
i
ought
to
add
that
some
practical
minds
tried
to
put
themselves
into
serious
communication
with
her
some
years
ago
a
german
mathematician
proposed
to
send
a
commission
of
to
the
steppes
of
siberia
there
on
the
vast
plains
immense
geometrical
figures
were
to
be
traced
by
means
of
luminous
reflectors
amongst
others
the
square
of
the
hypothenuse
vulgarly
called
the
bridge
intelligent
being
said
the
mathematician
to
understand
the
scientific
destination
of
that
figure
the
selenites
inhabitants
of
the
moon
if
they
exist
will
answer
by
a
similar
figure
and
communication
once
established
it
will
be
easy
to
create
an
alphabet
that
will
allow
us
to
hold
converse
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
thus
spoke
the
german
mathematician
but
his
project
was
not
put
into
execution
and
until
now
no
direct
communication
has
existed
between
the
earth
and
her
satellite
but
it
was
reserved
to
the
practical
genius
of
americans
to
put
itself
into
communication
with
the
sidereal
world
the
means
of
doing
so
are
simple
easy
certain
unfailing
and
will
make
the
subject
of
my
proposition
a
hubbub
and
tempest
of
exclamations
welcomed
these
words
there
was
not
one
of
the
audience
who
was
not
dominated
and
carried
away
by
the
words
of
the
orator
hear
hear
silence
was
heard
on
all
sides
when
the
agitation
was
calmed
down
barbicane
resumed
in
a
graver
tone
his
interrupted
speech
you
know
said
he
what
progress
the
science
of
ballistics
has
made
during
the
last
few
years
and
to
what
degree
of
perfection
firearms
would
have
been
brought
if
the
war
had
gone
on
you
are
not
ignorant
in
general
that
the
power
of
resistance
of
cannons
and
the
expansive
force
of
powder
are
unlimited
well
starting
from
that
principle
i
asked
myself
if
by
means
of
sufficient
apparatus
established
under
determined
conditions
of
resistance
it
would
not
be
possible
to
send
a
to
the
moon
at
these
words
an
oh
of
stupefaction
escaped
from
a
thousand
panting
breasts
then
occurred
a
moment
of
silence
like
the
profound
calm
that
precedes
thunder
in
fact
the
thunder
came
but
a
thunder
of
applause
cries
and
clamour
which
made
the
shake
again
the
president
tried
to
speak
he
could
not
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
that
he
succeeded
in
making
himself
heard
let
me
finish
he
resumed
coldly
i
have
looked
at
the
question
in
all
its
aspects
and
from
my
indisputable
calculations
it
results
that
any
projectile
hurled
at
an
initial
speed
of
twelve
thousand
yards
a
second
and
directed
at
the
moon
must
necessarily
reach
her
i
have
therefore
the
honour
of
proposing
to
you
my
worthy
colleagues
the
attempting
of
this
little
experiment
chapter
iii
effect
of
president
barbicane
communication
it
is
impossible
to
depict
the
effect
produced
by
the
last
words
of
the
honourable
president
what
cries
what
vociferations
what
a
succession
of
groans
hurrahs
cheers
and
all
the
onomatopoeia
of
which
the
american
language
is
so
full
it
was
an
indescribable
hubbub
and
disorder
mouths
hands
and
feet
made
as
much
noise
as
they
could
all
the
weapons
in
this
artillery
museum
going
off
at
once
would
not
have
more
violently
agitated
the
waves
of
sound
that
is
not
surprising
there
are
cannoneers
nearly
as
noisy
as
their
cannons
barbicane
remained
calm
amidst
these
enthusiastic
clamours
perhaps
he
again
wished
to
address
some
words
to
his
colleagues
for
his
gestures
asked
for
silence
and
his
fulminating
bell
exhausted
itself
in
violent
detonations
it
was
not
even
heard
he
was
soon
dragged
from
his
chair
carried
in
triumph
and
from
the
hands
of
his
faithful
comrades
he
passed
into
those
of
the
no
less
excited
crowd
nothing
can
astonish
an
american
it
has
often
been
repeated
that
the
word
impossible
is
not
french
the
wrong
dictionary
must
have
been
taken
by
mistake
in
america
everything
is
easy
everything
is
simple
and
as
to
mechanical
difficulties
they
are
dead
before
they
are
born
between
the
barbicane
project
and
its
realisation
not
one
true
yankee
would
have
allowed
himself
to
see
even
the
appearance
of
a
difficulty
as
soon
said
as
done
the
triumphant
march
of
the
president
was
prolonged
during
the
evening
a
veritable
torchlight
procession
irish
germans
frenchmen
scotchmen
all
the
heterogeneous
individuals
that
compose
the
population
of
maryland
shouted
in
their
maternal
tongue
and
the
cheering
was
unanimous
precisely
as
if
she
knew
it
was
all
about
her
the
moon
shone
out
then
with
serene
magnificence
eclipsing
other
lights
with
her
intense
irradiation
all
the
yankees
directed
their
eyes
towards
the
shining
disc
some
saluted
her
with
their
hands
others
called
her
by
the
sweetest
names
between
eight
and
midnight
an
optician
in
made
a
fortune
by
selling
the
queen
of
night
was
looked
at
through
them
like
a
lady
of
high
life
the
americans
acted
in
regard
to
her
with
the
freedom
of
proprietors
it
seemed
as
if
the
blonde
phoebe
belonged
to
these
enterprising
conquerors
and
already
formed
part
of
the
union
territory
and
yet
the
only
question
was
that
of
sending
a
projectile
a
rather
brutal
way
of
entering
into
communication
even
with
a
satellite
but
much
in
vogue
amongst
civilised
nations
midnight
had
just
struck
and
the
enthusiasm
did
not
diminish
it
was
kept
up
in
equal
doses
in
all
classes
of
the
population
magistrates
merchants
tradesmen
intelligent
as
well
as
green
men
were
moved
even
in
their
most
delicate
fibres
it
was
a
national
enterprise
the
high

the
quays
bathed
by
the
waters

not
have

gradually
abandoned

to

the

reposed
in
a
relative
tranquillity
it
would
be
an
error
to
believe
that

in
the
delirium
the
thirty
thousand
correspondents
of

were
acquainted
with
their
president
letter
and
awaited
with
equal
impatience
the
famous
communication
of
the
of
october
the
same
evening
as
the
orator
uttered
his
speech
it
ran
along
the
telegraph
wires
across
the

of

with
a
speed
of
miles
a
second
it
may
therefore
be
said
with
absolute
certainty
that
at
the
same
moment
the
united
states
of
america
ten
times
as
large
as
france
cheered
with
a
single
voice
and
millions
of
hearts
swollen
with
pride
beat
with
the
same
pulsation
the
next
day
five
hundred
daily
weekly
monthly
or

took
up
the
question
they
examined
it
under
its
different
aspects
physical
meteorological
economical
or
moral
from
a
political
or
social
point
of
view
they
debated
whether
the
moon
was
a
finished
world
or
if
she
was
not
still
undergoing
transformation
did
she
resemble
the
earth
in
the
time
when
the
atmosphere
did
not
yet
exist
what
kind
of
spectacle
would
her
hidden
hemisphere
present
to
our
terrestrial
spheroid
granting
that
the
question
at
present
was
simply
about
sending
a
projectile
to
the
queen
of
night
every
one
saw
in
that
the
of
a
series
of
experiments
all
hoped
that
one
day
america
would
penetrate
the

secrets
of
the
mysterious

and
some
even
seemed
to
fear
that
her
conquest
would
disturb
the

the

it
may
be
said
that
no

ever

so

adherents
there
was
no

of
hesitations

as
to
the
jokes

that
would
have
welcomed
in

the
idea
of

they
would
have
been

impey
barbicane
became
from
that
day
one
of
the
greatest
citizens
of
the
united

something
like
a
washington
of
science
and
one
fact
amongst
several
will
serve
to
show
the
sudden
homage
which
was
paid
by
a
nation
to
one
man
some
days
after
the
famous
meeting
of
the
gun
club
the
manager
of
an
english
company
announced
at
the
baltimore
theatre
a
representation
of
ado
about
but
the
population
of
the
town
seeing
in
the
title
a
damaging
allusion
to
the
projects
of
president
barbicane
invaded
the
theatre
broke
the
seats
and
forced
the
unfortunate
manager
to
change
the
play
like
a
sensible
man
the
manager
bowing
to
public
opinion
replaced
the
offending
comedy
by

and
for
several
weeks
he
had
fabulous

iv
answer
from
the
cambridge
observatory
in
the
meantime
barbicane
did
not
lose
an
instant
amidst
the
enthusiasm
of
which
he
was
the
object
his
first
care
was
to
call
together
his
colleagues
in
the
of
the
gun
club
there
after
a
debate
they
agreed
to
consult
astronomers
about
the
astronomical
part
of
their
enterprise
their
answer
once
known
they
would
then
discuss
the
mechanical
means
and
nothing
would
be
neglected
to
assure
the
success
of
their
great
experiment
a
note
in
precise
terms
containing
special
questions
was
drawn
up
and
addressed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
in
massachusetts
this
town
where
the
first
university
of
the
united
states
was
founded
is
justly
celebrated
for
its
astronomical
staff
there
are
assembled
the
greatest
men
of
science
there
is
the
powerful
telescope
which
enabled
bond
to
resolve
the
nebula
of
andromeda
and
clarke
to
discover
the
satellite
of
sirius
this
celebrated
institution
was
therefore
worthy
in
every
way
of
the
confidence
of
the
gun
club
after
two
days
the
answer
impatiently
awaited
reached
the
hands
of
president
barbicane
it
ran
as
follows
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
to
the
president
of
the
gun
club
at
on
the
receipt
of
your
favour
of
the
addressed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
in
the
name
of
the
members
of
the
baltimore
gun
club
we
immediately
called
a
meeting
of
our
staff
who
have
deemed
it
expedient
to
answer
as
follows
the
questions
proposed
to
it
were
these
is
it
possible
to
send
a
projectile
to
the
moon
what
is
the
exact
distance
that
separates
the
earth
and
her
satellite
what
would
be
the
duration
of
the
projectile
transit
to
which
a
sufficient
initial
speed
had
been
given
and
consequently
at
what
moment
should
it
be
hurled
so
as
to
reach
the
moon
at
a
particular
point
at
what
moment
would
the
moon
present
the
most
favourable
position
for
being
reached
by
the
projectile
what
point
in
the
heavens
ought
the
cannon
destined
to
hurl
the
projectile
be
aimed
at
what
place
in
the
heavens
will
the
moon
occupy
at
the
moment
when
the
projectile
will
start
regarding
question
no
it
possible
to
send
a
projectile
to
the
moon
yes
it
is
possible
to
send
a
projectile
to
the
moon
if
it
is
given
an
initial
velocity
of
yards
a
second
calculations
prove
that
this
speed
is
sufficient
in
proportion
to
the
distance
from
the
earth
the
force
of
gravitation
diminishes
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
the
square
of
the
distance
that
is
to
say
that
for
a
distance
three
times
greater
that
force
is
nine
times
less
in
consequence
the
weight
of
the
projectile
will
decrease
rapidly
and
will
end
by
being
completely
annulled
at
the
moment
when
the
attraction
of
the
moon
will
be
equal
to
that
of
the
earth
that
is
to
say
at
the
of
the
distance
at
that
moment
the
projectile
will
have
no
weight
at
all
and
if
it
clears
that
point
it
will
fall
on
to
the
moon
only
by
the
effect
of
lunar
gravitation
the
theoretic
possibility
of
the
experiment
is
therefore
quite
demonstrated
as
to
its
success
that
depends
solely
in
the
power
of
the
engine
employed
regarding
question
no
is
the
exact
distance
that
separates
the
earth
from
her
satellite
the
moon
does
not
describe
a
circle
round
the
earth
but
an
ellipse
of
which
our
earth
occupies
one
of
the
foci
the
consequence
is
therefore
that
at
certain
times
it
approaches
nearer
to
and
at
others
recedes
farther
from
the
earth
or
in
astronomical
language
it
has
its
apogee
and
its
perigee
at
its
apogee
the
moon
is
at
miles
from
the
earth
and
at
its
perigee
at
miles
only
which
makes
a
difference
of
or
more
than
a
ninth
of
the
distance
the
perigee
distance
is
therefore
the
one
that
should
give
us
the
basis
of
all
calculations
regarding
question
no
would
be
the
duration
of
the
projectile
transit
to
which
a
sufficient
initial
speed
has
been
given
and
consequently
at
what
moment
should
it
be
hurled
so
as
to
reach
the
moon
at
a
particular
point
if
the
projectile
kept
indefinitely
the
initial
speed
of
yards
a
second
it
would
only
take
about
nine
hours
to
reach
its
destination
but
as
that
initial
velocity
will
go
on
decreasing
it
will
happen
everything
calculated
upon
that
the
projectile
will
take
seconds
or
hours
and
minutes
to
reach
the
point
where
the
terrestrial
and
lunar
gravitations
are
equal
and
from
that
point
it
will
fall
upon
the
moon
in
seconds
or
hours
minutes
and
seconds
it
must
therefore
be
hurled
hours
minutes
and
seconds
before
the
arrival
of
the
moon
at
the
point
aimed
at
regarding
question
no
what
moment
would
the
moon
present
the
most
favourable
position
for
being
reached
by
the
projectile
according
to
what
has
been
said
above
the
epoch
of
the
moon
perigee
must
first
be
chosen
and
at
the
moment
when
she
will
be
crossing
her
zenith
which
will
still
further
diminish
the
entire
distance
by
a
length
equal
to
the
terrestrial
radius
miles
consequently
the
passage
to
be
accomplished
will
be
miles
but
the
moon
is
not
always
at
her
zenith
when
she
reaches
her
perigee
which
is
once
a
month
she
is
only
under
the
two
conditions
simultaneously
at
long
intervals
of
time
this
coincidence
of
perigee
and
zenith
must
be
waited
for
it
happens
fortunately
that
on
december
of
next
year
the
moon
will
offer
these
two
conditions
at
midnight
she
will
be
at
her
perigee
and
her
zenith
that
is
to
say
at
her
shortest
distance
from
the
earth
and
at
her
zenith
at
the
same
time
regarding
question
no
what
point
in
the
heavens
ought
the
cannon
destined
to
hurl
the
projectile
be
aimed
the
preceding
observations
being
admitted
the
cannon
ought
to
be
aimed
at
the
zenith
of
the
place
the
zenith
is
the
spot
situated
vertically
above
the
head
of
a
spectator
so
that
its
range
will
be
perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
and
the
projectile
will
pass
the
soonest
beyond
the
range
of
terrestrial
gravitation
but
for
the
moon
to
reach
the
zenith
of
a
place
that
place
must
not
exceed
in
latitude
the
declination
of
the
luminary
in
other
words
it
must
be
comprised
between
and
of
north
or
south
latitude
in
any
other
place
the
range
must
necessarily
be
oblique
which
would
seriously
affect
the
success
of
the
experiment
regarding
question
no
place
will
the
moon
occupy
in
the
heavens
at
the
moment
of
the
projectile
departure
at
the
moment
when
the
projectile
is
hurled
into
space
the
moon
which
travels
forward
each
day
will
be
four
times
as
distant
from
her
zenith
point
by
a
space
which
corresponds
to
the
distance
she
will
travel
during
the
transit
of
the
projectile
but
as
the
deviation
which
the
rotatory
movement
of
the
earth
will
impart
to
the
shock
must
also
be
taken
into
account
and
as
the
projectile
can
not
reach
the
moon
until
after
a
deviation
equal
to
sixteen
radii
of
the
earth
which
calculated
upon
the
moon
orbit
is
equal
to
about
it
is
necessary
to
add
these
to
those
caused
by
the
delay
of
the
moon
or
in
round
numbers
thus
at
the
moment
of
firing
the
visual
radius
applied
to
the
moon
will
describe
with
the
vertical
line
of
the
place
an
angle
of
such
are
the
answers
to
the
questions
proposed
to
the
observatory
of
cambridge
by
the
members
of
the
gun
club
to
sum
up
the
cannon
must
be
placed
in
a
country
situated
between
and
of
north
or
south
latitude
it
must
be
aimed
at
the
zenith
of
the
place
the
projectile
must
have
an
initial
speed
of
yards
a
second
it
must
be
hurled
on
december
of
next
year
at
it
will
meet
the
moon
four
days
after
its
departure
on
december
at
midnight
precisely
at
the
moment
she
arrives
at
her
zenith
the
members
of
the
gun
club
ought
therefore
at
once
to
commence
the
labour
necessitated
by
such
an
enterprise
and
be
ready
to
put
them
into
execution
at
the
moment
fixed
upon
for
they
will
not
find
the
moon
in
the
same
conditions
of
perigee
and
zenith
till
eighteen
years
and
eleven
days
later
the
staff
of
the
observatory
of
cambridge
puts
itself
entirely
at
their
disposition
for
questions
of
theoretic
astronomy
and
begs
to
join
its
congratulations
to
those
of
the
whole
of
america
on
behalf
of
the
staff
belfast
of
the
observatory
of
chapter
the
romance
of
the
moon
a
spectator
endowed
with
infinite
power
of
sight
and
placed
at
the
unknown
centre
round
which
gravitates
the
universe
would
have
seen
myriads
of
atoms
filling
all
space
during
the
chaotic
epoch
of
creation
but
by
degrees
as
centuries
went
on
a
change
took
place
a
law
of
gravitation
manifested
itself
which
the
wandering
atoms
obeyed
these
atoms
combined
chemically
according
to
their
affinities
formed
themselves
into
molecules
and
made
those
nebulous
masses
with
which
the
depths
of
the
heavens
are
strewed
these
masses
were
immediately
animated
by
a
movement
of
rotation
round
their
central
point
this
centre
made
of
vague
molecules
began
to
turn
on
itself
whilst
progressively
condensing
then
following
the
immutable
laws
of
mechanics
in
proportion
as
its
volume
became
diminished
by
condensation
its
movement
of
rotation
was
accelerated
and
these
two
effects
persisting
there
resulted
a
principal
planet
the
centre
of
the
nebulous
mass
by
watching
attentively
the
spectator
would
then
have
seen
other
molecules
in
the
mass
behave
like
the
central
planet
and
condense
in
the
same
manner
by
a
movement
of
rotation
and
gravitate
round
it
under
the
form
of
innumerable
stars
the
nebulae
of
which
astronomers
count
nearly
at
present
were
formed
amongst
these
nebulae
there
is
one
that
men
have
called
the
milky
way
and
which
contains
eighteen
millions
of
stars
each
of
which
has
become
the
centre
of
a
solar
world
if
the
spectator
had
then
specially
examined
amongst
these
eighteen
millions
of
stars
one
of
the
most
modest
and
least
brilliant
a
star
of
the
fourth
order
the
one
that
proudly
named
itself
the
sun
all
the
phenomena
to
which
the
formation
of
the
universe
is
due
would
have
successively
taken
place
under
his
eyes
in
fact
he
would
have
perceived
this
sun
still
in
its
gaseous
state
and
composed
of
mobile
molecules
he
would
have
perceived
it
turning
on
its
own
axis
to
finish
its
work
of
concentration
this
movement
faithful
to
the
laws
of
mechanics
would
have
been
accelerated
by
the
diminution
of
volume
and
a
time
would
have
come
when
the
centrifugal
force
would
have
overpowered
the
centripetal
which
causes
the
molecules
all
to
tend
towards
the
centre
then
another
phenomenon
would
have
passed
before
the
eyes
of
the
spectator
and
the
molecules
situated
in
the
plane
of
the
equator
would
have
formed
several
concentric
rings
like
that
of
saturn
round
the
sun
in
their
turn
these
rings
of
cosmic
matter
seized
with
a
movement
of
rotation
round
the
central
mass
would
have
been
broken
up
into
secondary
nebulae
that
is
to
say
into
planets
if
the
spectator
had
then
concentrated
all
his
attention
on
these
planets
he
would
have
seen
them
behave
exactly
like
the
sun
and
give
birth
to
one
or
more
cosmic
rings
origin
of
those
secondary
bodies
which
we
call
satellites
thus
in
going
up
from
the
atom
to
the
molecule
from
the
molecule
to
the
nebulae
and
from
the
nebulae
to
the
principal
star
from
the
principal
star
to
the
sun
from
the
sun
to
the
planet
and
from
the
planet
to
the
satellite
we
have
the
whole
series
of
transformations
undergone
by
the
celestial
powers
from
the
first
days
of
the
universe
the
sun
seems
lost
amidst
the
immensities
of
the
stellar
universe
and
yet
it
is
related
by
actual
theories
of
science
to
the
nebula
of
the
milky
way
centre
of
a
world
and
small
as
it
appears
amidst
the
ethereal
regions
it
is
still
enormous

its

discovered
at

some
of
these
asteroids
are
so
small
that
they
could
be
walked
round
in
a
single
day
by
going
at
a
gymnastic
pace
of
these
attendant
bodies
which
the
sun
maintains
in
their
elliptical
orbit
by
the
great

some

three
perhaps
and
the

one
this
latter
one
of
the
least
important
of
the
solar
world
is
called
the
moon
and
it
is
that
one
that
the
enterprising
genius
of
the
americans
means
to
conquer
the
queen
of
night
from
her
relative
proximity
and
the
spectacle
rapidly
renewed
of
her
different
phases
at
first
divided
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
with
the
sun
but
the
sun
tires
the
eyesight
and
the
splendour
of
its
light
forces
its
admirers
to
lower
their
eyes
the
blonde
phoebe
more
humane
graciously
allows
herself
to
be
seen
in
her
modest
grace
she
is
gentle
to
the
eye
not
ambitious
and
yet
she
sometimes
eclipses
her
brother
the
radiant
apollo
without
ever
being
eclipsed
by
him
the
mahommedans
understood
what
gratitude
they
owed
to
this
faithful
friend
of
the
earth
and
they
ruled
their
months
at
days
on
her
revolution
the
first
people
of
the
world
dedicated
particular
worship
to
this
chaste
goddess
the
egyptians
called
her
isis
the
phoenicians
astarte
the
greeks
phoebe
daughter
of
jupiter
and
latona
and
they
explained
her
eclipses
by
the
mysterious
visits
of
diana
and
the
handsome
endymion
the
mythological
legend
relates
that
the
nemean
lion
traversed
the
country
of
the
moon
before
its
apparition
upon
earth
and
the
poet
agesianax
quoted
by
plutarch
celebrated
in
his
sweet
lines
its
soft
eyes
charming
nose
and
admirable
mouth
formed
by
the
luminous
parts
of
the
adorable
selene
but
though
the
ancients
understood
the
character
temperament
and
in
a
word
moral
qualities
of
the
moon
from
a
mythological
point
of
view
the
most
learned
amongst
them
remained
very
ignorant
of
selenography
several
astronomers
however
of
ancient
times
discovered
certain
particulars
now
confirmed
by
science
though
the
arcadians
pretended
they
had
inhabited
the
earth
at
an
epoch
before
the
moon
existed
though
simplicius
believed
her
immovable
and
fastened
to
the
crystal
vault
though
tacitus
looked
upon
her
as
a
fragment
broken
off
from
the
solar
orbit
and
clearch
the
disciple
of
aristotle
made
of
her
a
polished
mirror
upon
which
were
reflected
the
images
of
the
ocean
though
in
short
others
only
saw
in
her
a
mass
of
vapours
exhaled
by
the
earth
or
a
globe
half
fire
and
half
ice
that
turned
on
itself
other
by
means
of
wise
observations
and
without
optical
instruments
suspected
most
of
the
laws
that
govern
the
queen
of
night
thus
thales
of
miletus
gave
out
the
opinion
that
the
moon
was
lighted
up
by
the
sun
aristarchus
of
samos
gave
the
right
explanation
of
her
phases
cleomenus
taught
that
she
shone
by
reflected
light
berose
the
chaldean
discovered
that
the
duration
of
her
movement
of
rotation
was
equal
to
that
of
her
movement
of
revolution
and
he
thus
explained
why
the
moon
always
presented
the
same
side
lastly
hipparchus
years
before
the
christian
era
discovered
some
inequalities
in
the
apparent
movements
of
the
earth
satellite
these
different
observations
were
afterwards
confirmed
and
other
astronomers
profited
by
them
ptolemy
in
the
second
century
and
the
arabian
aboul
wefa
in
the
tenth
completed
the
remarks
of
hipparchus
on
the
inequalities
that
the
moon
undergoes
whilst
following
the
undulating
line
of
its
orbit
under
the
action
of
the
sun
then
copernicus
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
tycho
brahe
in
the
sixteenth
completely
exposed
the
system
of
the
world
and
the
part
that
the
moon
plays
amongst
the
celestial
bodies
at
that
epoch
her
movements
were
pretty
well
known
but
very
little
of
her
physical
constitution
was
known
it
was
then
that
galileo
explained
the
phenomena
of
light
produced
in
certain
phases
by
the
existence
of
mountains
to
which
he
gave
an
average
height
of
feet
after
him
hevelius
an
astronomer
of
dantzig
lowered
the
highest
altitudes
to
feet
but
his
contemporary
riccioli
brought
them
up
again
to
feet
herschel
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
armed
with
a
powerful
telescope
considerably
reduced
the
preceding
measurements
he
gave
a
height
of
feet
to
the
highest
mountains
and
brought
down
the
average
of
different
heights
to
little
more
than
feet
but
herschel
was
mistaken
too
and
the
observations
of
schroeter
louville
halley
nasmyth
bianchini
pastorff
lohrman
gruithuysen
and
especially
the
patient
studies
of
mm
boeer
and
moedler
were
necessary
to
definitely
resolve
the
question
thanks
to
these
the
elevation
of
the
mountains
of
the
moon
is
now
perfectly
known
boeer
and
moedler
measured
different
elevations
of
which
six
exceed
feet
and
exceed
feet
their
highest
summit
towers
to
a
height
of
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
lunar
disc
at
the
same
time
the
survey
of
the
moon
was
being
completed
she
appeared
riddled
with
craters
and
her
essentially
volcanic
nature
was
affirmed
by
each
observation
from
the
absence
of
refraction
in
the
rays
of
the
planets
occulted
by
her
it
is
concluded
that
she
can
have
no
atmosphere
this
absence
of
air
entails
absence
of
water
it
therefore
became
manifest
that
the
selenites
in
order
to
live
under
such
conditions
must
have
a
special
organisation
and
differ
singularly
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
lastly
thanks
to
new
methods
more
perfected
instruments
searched
the
moon
without
intermission
leaving
not
a
point
of
her
surface
unexplored
and
yet
her
diameter
measures
miles
her
surface
is
of
the
surface
of
the
globe
and
her
volume
of
the
volume
of
the
terrestrial
spheroid
but
none
of
her
secrets
could
escape
the
astronomers
eyes
and
these
clever
carried
their
wonderful
observations
still
further
thus
they
remarked
that
when
the
moon
was
at
her
full
the
disc
appeared
in
certain
places
striped
with
white
lines
and
during
her
phases
striped
with
black
lines
by
prosecuting
the
study
of
these
with
greater
precision
they
succeeded
in
making
out
the
exact
nature
of
these
lines
they
are
long
and
narrow
furrows
sunk
between
parallel
ridges
bordering
generally
upon
the
edges
of
the
craters
their
length
varied
from
ten
to
one
hundred
miles
and
their
width
was
about
yards
astronomers
called
them
furrows
and
that
was
all
they
could
do
they
could
not
ascertain
whether
they
were
the
beds
of
ancient
rivers
or
not
the
americans
hope
some
day
or
other
to
determine
this
geological
question
they
also
undertake
to
reconnoitre
the
series
of
parallel
ramparts
discovered
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
by
gruithuysen
a
learned
professor
of
munich
who
considered
them
to
be
a
system
of
elevated
fortifications
raised
by
selenite
engineers
these
two
still
obscure
points
and
doubtless
many
others
can
only
be
definitely
settled
by
direct
communication
with
the
moon
as
to
the
intensity
of
her
light
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
learnt
it
is
times
weaker
than
that
of
the
sun
and
its
heat
has
no
appreciable
action
upon
thermometers
as
to
the
phenomenon
known
as
the
ashy
light
it
is
naturally
explained
by
the
effect
of
the
sun
rays
transmitted
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
and
which
seem
to
complete
the
lunar
disc
when
it
presents
a
crescent
form
during
its
first
and
last
phases
such
was
the
state
of
knowledge
acquired
respecting
the
satellite
which
the
gun
club
undertook
to
perfect
under
all
its
aspects
cosmographical
geographical
geological
political
and
moral
chapter
vi
what
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
and
what
is
no
longer
allowed
to
be
believed
in
the
united
states
the
immediate
effect
of
barbicane
proposition
was
that
of
bringing
out
all
astronomical
facts
relative
to
the
queen
of
night
everybody
began
to
study
her
assiduously
it
seemed
as
if
the
moon
had
appeared
on
the
horizon
for
the
first
time
and
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
her
in
the
sky
before
she
became
the
fashion
she
was
the
lion
of
the
day
without
appearing
less
modest
on
that
account
and
took
her
place
amongst
the
stars
without
being
any
the
prouder
the
newspapers
revived
old
anecdotes
in
which
this
sun
of
the
wolves
played
a
part
they
recalled
the
influence
which
the
ignorance
of
past
ages
had
ascribed
to
her
they
sang
about
her
in
every
tone
a
little
more
and
they
would
have
quoted
her
witty
sayings
the
whole
of
america
was
filled
with
selenomania
the
scientific
journals
treated
the
question
which
touched
upon
the
enterprise
of
the
gun
club
more
specially
they
published
the
letter
from
the
observatory
of
cambridge
they
commented
upon
it
and
approved
of
it
without
reserve
in
short
even
the
most
ignorant
yankee
was
no
longer
allowed
to
be
ignorant
of
a
single
fact
relative
to
his
satellite
nor
to
the
oldest
women
amongst
them
to
have
any
superstitions
about
her
left
science
flooded
them
it
penetrated
into
their
eyes
and
ears
it
was
impossible
to
be
an
ass
in
astronomy
until
then
many
people
did
not
know
how
the
distance
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
had
been
calculated
this
fact
was
taken
advantage
of
to
explain
to
them
that
it
was
done
by
measuring
the
parallax
of
the
moon
if
the
word
parallax
seemed
new
to
them
they
were
told
it
was
the
angle
formed
by
two
straight
lines
drawn
from
either
extremity
of
the
earth
radius
to
the
moon
if
they
were
in
doubt
about
the
perfection
of
this
method
it
was
immediately
proved
to
them
that
not
only
was
the
mean
distance
miles
but
that
astronomers
were
right
to
within
seventy
miles
to
those
who
were
not
familiar
with
the
movements
of
the
moon
the
newspapers
demonstrated
daily
that
she
possesses
two
distinct
movements
the
first
being
that
of
rotation
upon
her
axis
the
second
that
of
revolution
round
the
earth
accomplishing
both
in
the
same
time
that
is
to
say
in
days
the
movement
of
rotation
is
the
one
that
causes
night
and
day
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
only
there
is
but
one
day
and
one
night
in
a
lunar
month
and
they
each
last
hours
but
happily
the
face
turned
towards
the
terrestrial
globe
is
lighted
by
it
with
an
intensity
equal
to
the
light
of
fourteen
moons
as
to
the
other
face
the
one
always
invisible
it
has
naturally
hours
of
absolute
night
tempered
only
by
the
pale
light
that
falls
from
the
stars
this
phenomenon
is
due
solely
to
the
peculiarity
that
the
movements
of
rotation
and
revolution
are
accomplished
in
rigorously
equal
periods
a
phenomenon
which
according
to
cassini
and
herschel
is
common
to
the
satellites
of
jupiter
and
very
probably
to
the
other
satellites
some
but
rather
unyielding
minds
did
not
quite
understand
at
first
how
if
the
moon
invariably
shows
the
same
face
to
the
earth
during
her
revolution
she
describes
one
turn
round
herself
in
the
same
period
of
time
to
such
it
was
answered
go
into
your
and
turn
round
the
table
so
as
always
to
keep
your
face
towards
the
centre
when
your
circular
walk
is
ended
you
will
have
described
one
circle
round
yourselves
since
your
eye
will
have
successively
traversed
every
point
of
the
room
well
then
the
room
is
the
heavens
the
table
is
the
earth
and
you
are
the
moon
and
they
go
away
delighted
with
the
comparison
thus
then
the
moon
always
presents
the
same
face
to
the
earth
still
to
be
quite
exact
it
should
be
added
that
in
consequence
of
certain
fluctuations
from
north
to
south
and
from
west
to
east
called
libration
she
shows
rather
more
than
the
half
of
her
disc
about
when
the
ignoramuses
knew
as
much
as
the
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
about
the
moon
movement
of
rotation
they
began
to
make
themselves
uneasy
about
her
movement
of
revolution
round
the
earth
and
twenty
scientific
reviews
quickly
gave
them
the
information
they
wanted
they
then
learnt
that
the
firmament
with
its
infinite
stars
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
vast
dial
upon
which
the
moon
moves
indicating
the
time
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
it
is
in
this
movement
that
the
queen
of
night
shows
herself
in
her
different
phases
that
she
is
full
when
she
is
in
opposition
with
the
sun
that
is
to
say
when
the
three
bodies
are
on
a
line
with
each
other
the
earth
being
in
the
centre
that
the
moon
is
new
when
she
is
in
conjunction
with
the
sun
that
is
to
say
when
she
is
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
lastly
that
the
moon
is
in
her
first
or
last
quarter
when
she
makes
with
the
sun
and
the
earth
a
right
angle
of
which
she
occupies
the
apex
some
perspicacious
yankees
inferred
in
consequence
that
eclipses
could
only
take
place
at
the
periods
of
conjunction
or
opposition
and
their
reasoning
was
just
in
conjunction
the
moon
can
eclipse
the
sun
whilst
in
opposition
it
is
the
earth
that
can
eclipse
him
in
her
turn
and
the
reason
these
eclipses
do
not
happen
twice
in
a
lunar
month
is
because
the
plane
upon
which
the
moon
moves
is
elliptical
like
that
of
the
earth
as
to
the
height
which
the
queen
of
night
can
attain
above
the
horizon
the
letter
from
the
observatory
of
cambridge
contained
all
that
can
be
said
about
it
every
one
knew
that
this
height
varies
according
to
the
latitude
of
the
place
where
the
observation
is
taken
but
the
only
zones
of
the
globe
where
the
moon
reaches
her
zenith
that
is
to
say
where
she
is
directly
above
the
heads
of
the
spectators
are
necessarily
comprised
between
the
parallels
and
the
equator
hence
the
important
recommendation
given
to
attempt
the
experiment
upon
some
point
in
this
part
of
the
globe
in
order
that
the
projectile
may
be
hurled
perpendicularly
and
may
thus
more
quickly
escape
the
attraction
of
gravitation
this
was
a
condition
essential
to
the
success
of
the
enterprise
and
public
opinion
was
much
exercised
thereupon
as
to
the
line
followed
by
the
moon
in
her
revolution
round
the
earth
the
observatory
of
cambridge
had
demonstrated
to
the
most
ignorant
that
it
is
an
ellipse
of
which
the
earth
occupies
one
of
the
foci
these
elliptical
orbits
are
common
to
all
the
planets
as
well
as
to
all
the
satellites
and
rational
mechanism
rigorously
proves
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
it
was
clearly
understood
that
when
at
her
apogee
the
moon
was
farthest
from
the
earth
and
when
at
her
perigee
she
was
nearest
to
our
planet
this
therefore
was
what
every
american
knew
whether
he
wished
to
or
no
and
what
no
one
could
decently
be
ignorant
of
but
if
these
true
principles
rapidly
made
their
way
certain
illusive
fears
and
many
errors
were
with
difficulty
cleared
away
some
worthy
people
maintained
for
instance
that
the
moon
was
an
ancient
comet
which
whilst
travelling
along
its
elongated
orbit
round
the
sun
passed
near
to
the
earth
and
was
retained
in
her
circle
of
attraction
the
astronomers
pretended
to
explain
thus
the
burnt
aspect
of
the
moon
a
misfortune
of
which
they
accused
the
sun
only
when
they
were
told
to
notice
that
comets
have
an
atmosphere
and
that
the
moon
has
little
or
none
they
did
not
know
what
to
answer
others
belonging
to
the
class
of
shakers
manifested
certain
fears
about
the
moon
they
had
heard
that
since
the
observations
made
in
the
times
of
the
caliphs
her
movement
of
revolution
had
accelerated
in
a
certain
proportion
they
thence
very
logically
concluded
that
an
acceleration
of
movement
must
correspond
to
a
diminution
in
the
distance
between
the
two
bodies
and
that
this
double
effect
going
on
infinitely
the
moon
would
one
day
end
by
falling
into
the
earth
however
they
were
obliged
to
reassure
themselves
and
cease
to
fear
for
future
generations
when
they
were
told
that
according
to
the
calculations
of
laplace
an
illustrious
french
mathematician
this
acceleration
of
movement
was
restricted
within
very
narrow
limits
and
that
a
proportional
diminution
will
follow
it
thus
the
equilibrium
of
the
solar
world
can
not
be
disturbed
in
future
centuries
lastly
there
was
the
superstitious
class
of
ignoramuses
to
be
dealt
with
these
are
not
content
with
being
ignorant
they
know
what
does
not
exist
and
about
the
moon
they
know
a
great
deal
some
of
them
considered
her
disc
to
be
a
polished
mirror
by
means
of
which
people
might
see
themselves
from
different
points
on
the
earth
and
communicate
their
thoughts
to
one
another
others
pretended
that
out
of
new
moons
had
brought
some
notable
change
such
as
cataclysms
revolutions
earthquakes
deluges
they
therefore
believed
in
the
mysterious
influence
of
the
queen
of
night
on
human
destinies
they
think
that
every
selenite
is
connected
by
some
sympathetic
tie
with
each
inhabitant
of
the
earth
they
pretend
with
mead
that
she
entirely
governs
the
vital
system
that
boys
are
born
during
the
new
moon
and
girls
during
her
last
quarter
but
at
last
it
became
necessary
to
give
up
these
vulgar
errors
to
come
back
to
truth
and
if
the
moon
stripped
of
her
influence
lost
her
prestige
in
the
minds
of
courtesans
of
every
power
if
some
turned
their
backs
on
her
the
immense
majority
were
in
her
favour
as
to
the
yankees
they
had
no
other
ambition
than
that
of
taking
possession
of
this
new
continent
of
the
sky
and
to
plant
upon
its
highest
summit
the
banner
of
the
united
states
of
america
chapter
vii
the
hymn
of
the
the
cambridge
observatory
had
in
its
memorable
letter
of
october
treated
the
question
from
an
astronomical
point
of
view
the
mechanical
point
had
still
to
be
treated
it
was
then
that
the
practical
difficulties
would
have
seemed
insurmountable
to
any
other
country
but
america
but
there
they
were
looked
upon
as
play
president
barbicane
had
without
losing
any
time
nominated
a
working
committee
in
the
heart
of
the
gun
club
this
committee
was
in
three
sittings
to
elucidate
the
three
great
questions
of
the
cannon
the
projectile
and
the
powder
it
was
composed
of
four
members
very
learned
upon
these
matters
barbicane
had
the
casting
vote
and
with
him
were
associated
general
morgan
major
elphinstone
and
lastly
the
inevitable
maston
to
whom
were
confided
the
functions
of
secretary
on
the
of
october
the
committee
met
at
president
barbicane
house
no
as
it
was
important
that
the
stomach
should
not
trouble
so
important
a
debate
the
four
members
of
the
gun
club
took
their
seats
at
a
table
covered
with
sandwiches
and
teapots
maston
immediately
screwed
his
pen
on
to
his
steel
hook
and
the
business
began
barbicane
opened
the
meeting
as
follows
dear
colleagues
said
he
we
have
to
solve
one
of
the
more
important
problems
in
ballistics
that
greatest
of
sciences
which
treats
of
the
movement
of
projectiles
that
is
to
say
of
bodies
hurled
into
space
by
some
power
of
impulsion
and
then
left
to
themselves
oh
ballistics
ballistics
cried
maston
in
a
voice
of
emotion
perhaps
continued
barbicane
the
most
logical
thing
would
be
to
consecrate
this
first
meeting
to
discussing
the
engine
certainly
answered
general
morgan
nevertheless
continued
barbicane
after
mature
deliberation
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
the
projectile
ought
to
precede
that
of
the
cannon
and
that
the
dimensions
of
the
latter
ought
to
depend
upon
the
dimensions
of
the
former
maston
here
interrupted
the
president
and
was
heard
with
the
attention
which
his
magnificent
past
career
deserved
my
dear
friends
said
he
in
an
inspired
tone
our
president
is
right
to
give
the
question
of
the
projectile
the
precedence
of
every
other
the
we
mean
to
hurl
at
the
moon
will
be
our
messenger
our
ambassador
and
i
ask
your
permission
to
regard
it
from
an
entirely
moral
point
of
view
this
new
way
of
looking
at
a
projectile
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
members
of
the
committee
they
therefore
listened
attentively
to
the
words
of
maston
my
dear
colleagues
he
continued
i
will
be
brief
i
will
lay
aside
the
material
projectile
the
projectile
that
kills
in
order
to
take
up
the
mathematical
projectile
the
moral
projectile
a
is
to
me
the
most
brilliant
manifestation
of
human
power
and
by
creating
it
man
has
approached
nearest
to
the
creator
hear
hear
said
major
elphinstone
in
fact
cried
the
orator
if
god
has
made
the
stars
and
the
planets
man
has
made
the
that
criterion
of
terrestrial
speed
that
reduction
of
bodies
wandering
in
space
which
are
really
nothing
but
projectiles
let
providence
claim
the
speed
of
electricity
light
the
stars
comets
planets
satellites
sound
and
wind
but
ours
is
the
speed
of
the
a
hundred
times
greater
than
that
of
trains
and
the
fastest
horses
maston
was
inspired
his
accents
became
quite
lyrical
as
he
chanted
the
hymn
consecrated
to
the
projectile
would
you
like
figures
continued
he
here
are
eloquent
ones
take
the
simple
pounder
though
it
moves
times
slower
than
electricity
times
slower
than
light
times
slower
than
the
earth
in
her
movement
of
translation
round
the
sun
yet
when
it
leaves
the
cannon
it
goes
quicker
than
sound
it
goes
at
the
rate
of
miles
a
minute
miles
an
hour
miles
a
day
that
is
to
say
at
the
speed
of
the
points
of
the
equator
in
the
globe
movement
of
rotation
miles
a
year
it
would
therefore
take
days
to
get
to
the
moon
years
to
get
to
the
sun
years
to
reach
neptune
at
the
limits
of
the
solar
world
that
is
what
this
modest
the
work
of
our
hands
can
do
what
will
it
be
therefore
when
with
twenty
times
that
speed
we
shall
hurl
it
with
a
rapidity
of
seven
miles
a
second
ah
splendid
shot
superb
projectile
i
like
to
think
you
will
be
received
up
there
with
the
honours
due
to
a
terrestrial
ambassador
cheers
greeted
this
brilliant
peroration
and
maston
overcome
with
emotion
sat
down
amidst
the
felicitations
of
his
colleagues
and
now
said
barbicane
that
we
have
given
some
time
to
poetry
let
us
proceed
to
facts
we
are
ready
answered
the
members
of
the
committee
as
they
each
demolished
sandwiches
you
know
what
problem
it
is
we
have
to
solve
continued
the
president
it
is
that
of
endowing
a
projectile
with
a
speed
of
yards
per
second
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
succeed
but
at
present
let
us
see
what
speeds
we
have
already
obtained
general
morgan
can
edify
us
upon
that
subject
so
much
the
more
easily
answered
the
general
because
during
the
war
i
was
a
member
of
the
experiment
commission
the
cannon
of
dahlgren
with
a
range
of
yards
gave
their
projectiles
an
initial
speed
of
yards
a
second
yes
and
the
rodman
columbiad
the
americans
gave
the
name
of
columbiad
to
their
enormous
engines
of
destruction
asked
the
president
the
rodman
columbiad
tried
at
fort
hamilton
near
new
york
hurled
a
projectile
weighing
half
a
ton
a
distance
of
six
miles
with
a
speed
of
yards
a
second
a
result
which
neither
armstrong
nor
palliser
has
obtained
in
england
englishmen
are
nowhere
said
maston
pointing
his
formidable
steel
hook
eastward
then
resumed
barbicane
a
speed
of
yards
is
the
maximum
obtained
at
present
yes
answered
morgan
i
might
add
however
replied
maston
that
if
my
mortar
had
not
been
blown
up
yes
but
it
was
blown
up
replied
barbicane
with
a
benevolent
gesture
we
must
take
the
speed
of
yards
for
a
starting
point
we
must
keep
till
another
meeting
the
discussion
of
the
means
used
to
produce
this
speed
allow
me
to
call
your
attention
to
the
dimensions
which
our
projectile
must
have
of
course
it
must
be
something
very
different
to
one
of
half
a
ton
weight
why
asked
the
major
because
quickly
answered
maston
it
must
be
large
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
supposing
there
are
any
yes
answered
barbicane
and
for
another
reason
still
more
important
what
do
you
mean
barbicane
asked
the
major
i
mean
that
it
is
not
enough
to
send
up
a
projectile
and
then
to
think
no
more
about
it
we
must
follow
it
in
its
transit
what
said
the
general
slightly
surprised
at
the
proposition
certainly
replied
barbicane
like
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
saying
or
our
experiment
will
be
without
result
but
then
replied
the
major
you
will
have
to
give
the
projectile
enormous
dimensions
no
please
grant
me
your
attention
you
know
that
optical
instruments
have
acquired
great
perfection
certain
telescopes
increase
objects
six
thousand
and
bring
the
moon
to
within
a
distance
of
forty
miles
now
at
that
distance
objects
sixty
feet
square
are
perfectly
visible
the
power
of
penetration
of
the
telescope
has
not
been
increased
because
that
power
is
only
exercised
to
the
detriment
of
their
clearness
and
the
moon
which
is
only
a
reflecting
mirror
does
not
send
a
light
intense
enough
for
the
telescopes
to
increase
objects
beyond
that
limit
very
well
then
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
the
general
do
you
intend
giving
a
diameter
of
sixty
feet
to
your
projectile
no
you
are
not
going
to
take
upon
yourself
the
task
of
making
the
moon
more
luminous
i
am
though
that
rather
strong
exclaimed
maston
yes
but
simple
answered
barbicane
if
i
succeed
in
lessening
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
which
the
moon
light
traverses
shall
i
not
render
that
light
more
intense
evidently
in
order
to
obtain
that
result
i
shall
only
have
to
establish
my
telescope
upon
some
high
mountain
we
can
do
that
i
give
in
answered
the
major
you
have
such
a
way
of
simplifying
things
what
enlargement
do
you
hope
to
obtain
thus
one
of
times
which
will
bring
the
moon
within
five
miles
only
and
objects
will
only
need
a
diameter
of
nine
feet
perfect
exclaimed
maston
then
our
projectile
will
have
a
diameter
of
nine
feet
precisely
allow
me
to
inform
you
however
returned
major
elphinstone
that
its
weight
will
still
be
oh
major
answered
barbicane
before
discussing
its
weight
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
our
forefathers
did
marvels
in
that
way
far
be
it
from
me
to
pretend
that
ballistics
have
not
progressed
but
it
is
well
to
know
that
in
the
middle
ages
surprising
results
were
obtained
i
dare
affirm
even
more
surprising
than
ours
justify
your
statement
exclaimed
maston
nothing
is
easier
answered
barbicane
i
can
give
you
some
examples
at
the
siege
of
constantinople
by
mahomet
in
they
hurled
stone
bullets
that
weighed
lbs
at
malta
in
the
time
of
its
knights
a
certain
cannon
of
fort
saint
elme
hurled
projectiles
weighing
lbs
according
to
a
french
historian
under
louis
xi
a
mortar
hurled
a
bomb
of
lbs
only
but
that
bomb
fired
at
the
bastille
a
place
where
mad
men
imprisoned
wise
ones
fell
at
charenton
where
wise
men
imprison
mad
ones
very
well
said
maston
since
what
have
we
seen
after
all
the
armstrong
cannons
hurl
projectiles
of
and
the
rodman
columbiads
projectiles
of
half
a
ton
it
seems
then
that
if
projectiles
have
increased
in
range
they
have
lost
in
weight
now
if
we
turn
our
efforts
in
that
direction
we
must
succeed
with
the
progress
of
the
science
in
doubling
the
weight
of
the
projectiles
of
mahomet
ii
and
the
knights
of
malta
that
is
evident
answered
the
major
but
what
metal
do
you
intend
to
employ
for
your
own
projectile
simply
said
general
morgan
exclaimed
maston
disdainfully
that
very
common
for
a
bullet
destined
to
go
to
the
moon
do
not
let
us
exaggerate
my
honourable
friend
answered
morgan
will
be
sufficient
then
replied
major
elphinstone
as
the
weight
of
the
projectile
is
in
proportion
to
its
volume
a
bullet
measuring
nine
feet
in
diameter
will
still
be
frightfully
heavy
yes
if
it
be
solid
but
not
if
it
be
hollow
said
barbicane
hollow
then
it
will
be
an
obus
in
which
we
can
put
despatches
replied
maston
and
specimens
of
our
terrestrial
productions
yes
an
obus
answered
barbicane
that
is
what
it
must
be
a
solid
bullet
of
inches
would
weigh
more
than
a
weight
evidently
too
great
however
as
it
is
necessary
to
give
the
projectile
a
certain
stability
i
propose
to
give
it
a
weight
of
lbs
what
will
be
the
thickness
of
the
metal
asked
the
major
if
we
follow
the
usual
proportions
replied
morgan
a
diameter
of
inches
demands
sides
two
feet
thick
at
least
that
would
be
much
too
thick
answered
barbicane
we
do
not
want
a
projectile
to
pierce
it
only
needs
sides
strong
enough
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
this
therefore
is
the
problem
what
thickness
ought
an
iron
obus
to
have
in
order
to
weigh
only
our
clever
calculator
maston
will
tell
us
at
once
nothing
is
easier
replied
the
honourable
secretary
so
saying
he
traced
some
algebraical
signs
on
the
paper
amongst
which
and
frequently
appeared
he
even
seemed
to
extract
from
them
a
certain
cubic
root
and
said
the
sides
must
be
hardly
two
inches
thick
will
that
be
sufficient
asked
the
major
doubtfully
no
answered
the
president
certainly
not
then
what
must
be
done
resumed
elphinstone
looking
puzzled
we
must
use
another
metal
instead
of
brass
suggested
morgan
no
that
is
too
heavy
too
and
i
have
something
better
than
that
to
propose
what
asked
the
major
aluminium
answered
barbicane
aluminium
cried
all
the
three
colleagues
of
the
president
certainly
my
friends
you
know
that
an
illustrious
french
chemist
henry
claire
deville
succeeded
in
in
obtaining
aluminium
in
a
compact
mass
this
precious
metal
possesses
the
whiteness
of
silver
the
indestructibility
of
gold
the
tenacity
of
iron
the
fusibility
of
copper
the
lightness
of
glass
it
is
easily
wrought
and
is
very
widely
distributed
in
nature
as
aluminium
forms
the
basis
of
most
rocks
it
is
three
times
lighter
than
iron
and
seems
to
have
been
created
expressly
to
furnish
us
with
the
material
for
our
projectile
hurrah
for
aluminium
cried
the
secretary
always
very
noisy
in
his
moments
of
enthusiasm
but
my
dear
president
said
the
major
is
not
aluminium
quoted
exceedingly
high
it
was
so
answered
barbicane
when
first
discovered
a
pound
of
aluminium
cost
to
dollars
then
it
fell
to
dollars
and
now
it
is
worth
nine
dollars
but
nine
dollars
a
pound
replied
the
major
who
did
not
easily
give
in
that
is
still
an
enormous
price
doubtless
my
dear
major
but
not
out
of
reach
what
will
the
projectile
weigh
then
asked
morgan
here
is
the
result
of
my
calculations
answered
barbicane
a
projectile
of
inches
in
diameter
and
inches
thick
would
weigh
if
it
were
made
of
lbs
cast
in
aluminium
it
would
be
reduced
to
lbs
perfect
cried
maston
that
suits
our
programme
capitally
yes
replied
the
major
but
do
you
not
know
that
at
nine
dollars
a
pound
the
projectile
would
cost
one
hundred
thousand
and
fifty
dollars
yes
i
know
that
but
fear
nothing
my
friends
money
for
our
enterprise
will
not
be
wanting
i
answer
for
that
it
will
be
showered
upon
us
replied
maston
well
what
do
you
say
to
aluminium
asked
the
president
adopted
answered
the
three
members
of
the
committee
as
to
the
form
of
the
projectile
resumed
barbicane
it
is
of
little
consequence
since
once
the
atmosphere
cleared
it
will
find
itself
in
empty
space
i
therefore
propose
a
round
ball
which
will
turn
on
itself
if
it
so
pleases
thus
ended
the
first
committee
meeting
the
question
of
the
projectile
was
definitely
resolved
upon
and
maston
was
delighted
with
the
idea
of
sending
an
aluminium
bullet
to
the
selenites
as
it
will
give
them
no
end
of
an
idea
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
chapter
viii
history
of
the
cannon
the
resolutions
passed
at
this
meeting
produced
a
great
effect
outside
some
timid
people
grew
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
a
projectile
weighing
lbs
hurled
into
space
people
asked
what
cannon
could
ever
transmit
an
initial
speed
sufficient
for
such
a
mass
the
report
of
the
second
meeting
was
destined
to
answer
these
questions
victoriously
the
next
evening
the
four
members
of
the
gun
club
sat
down
before
fresh
mountains
of
sandwiches
and
a
veritable
ocean
of
tea
the
debate
then
began
my
dear
colleagues
said
barbicane
we
are
going
to
occupy
ourselves
with
the
construction
of
the
engine
its
length
form
composition
and
weight
it
is
probable
that
we
shall
have
to
give
it
gigantic
dimensions
but
however
great
our
difficulties
might
be
our
industrial
genius
will
easily
overcome
them
will
you
please
listen
to
me
and
spare
objections
for
the
present
i
do
not
fear
them
an
approving
murmur
greeted
this
declaration
we
must
not
forget
resumed
barbicane
to
what
point
our
debate
brought
us
the
problem
is
now
the
following
how
to
give
an
initial
speed
of
yards
a
second
to
a
shot
inches
in
diameter
weighing
lbs
that
is
the
problem
indeed
answered
major
elphinstone
when
a
projectile
is
hurled
into
space
resumed
barbicane
what
happens
it
is
acted
upon
by
three
independent
forces
the
resistance
of
the
medium
the
attraction
of
the
earth
and
the
force
of
impulsion
with
which
it
is
animated
let
us
examine
these
three
forces
the
resistance
of
the
medium
that
is
to
say
the
resistance
of
the
air
is
of
little
importance
in
fact
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
is
only
forty
miles
deep
with
a
rapidity
of
yards
the
projectile
will
cross
that
in
five
seconds
and
this
time
will
be
short
enough
to
make
the
resistance
of
the
medium
insignificant
let
us
now
pass
to
the
attraction
of
the
earth
that
is
to
say
to
the
weight
of
the
projectile
we
know
that
that
weight
diminishes
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
the
square
of
distances
in
fact
this
is
what
physics
teach
us
when
a
body
left
to
itself
falls
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
falls
feet
in
the
first
second
and
if
the
same
body
had
to
fall
miles
that
is
to
say
the
distance
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
its
fall
would
be
reduced
to
half
a
line
in
the
first
second
that
is
almost
equivalent
to
immobility
the
question
is
therefore
how
progressively
to
overcome
this
law
of
gravitation
how
shall
we
do
it
by
the
force
of
impulsion
that
is
the
difficulty
answered
the
major
that
is
it
indeed
replied
the
president
but
we
shall
triumph
over
it
for
this
force
of
impulsion
we
want
depends
on
the
length
of
the
engine
and
the
quantity
of
powder
employed
the
one
only
being
limited
by
the
resistance
of
the
other
let
us
occupy
ourselves
therefore
with
the
dimensions
to
be
given
to
the
cannon
it
is
quite
understood
that
we
can
make
it
as
large
as
we
like
seeing
it
will
not
have
to
be
moved
all
that
is
evident
replied
the
general
until
now
said
barbicane
the
longest
cannon
our
enormous
columbiads
have
not
been
more
than
feet
long
we
shall
therefore
astonish
many
people
by
the
dimensions
we
shall
have
to
adopt
certainly
exclaimed
maston
for
my
part
i
ask
for
a
cannon
half
a
mile
long
at
least
half
a
mile
cried
the
major
and
the
general
yes
half
a
mile
and
that
will
be
half
too
short
come
maston
answered
morgan
you
exaggerate
no
i
do
not
said
the
irate
secretary
and
i
really
do
not
know
why
you
tax
me
with
exaggeration
because
you
go
too
far
you
must
know
sir
answered
maston
looking
dignified
that
an
artilleryman
is
like
a
he
can
never
go
too
far
the
debate
was
getting
personal
but
the
president
interfered
be
calm
my
friends
and
let
us
reason
it
out
we
evidently
want
a
gun
of
great
range
as
the
length
of
the
engine
will
increase
the
detention
of
gas
accumulated
behind
the
projectile
but
it
is
useless
to
overstep
certain
limits
perfectly
said
the
major
what
are
the
usual
rules
in
such
a
case
ordinarily
the
length
of
a
cannon
is
twenty
or
times
the
diameter
of
the
projectile
and
it
weighs
to
times
its
weight
it
is
not
enough
cried
maston
with
impetuosity
i
agree
to
that
my
worthy
friend
and
in
fact
by
keeping
that
proportion
for
a
projectile
nine
feet
wide
weighing
the
engine
would
only
have
a
length
of
feet
and
a
weight
of
lbs
that
is
ridiculous
resumed
maston
you
might
as
well
take
a
pistol
i
think
so
too
answered
barbicane
that
is
why
i
propose
to
quadruple
that
length
and
to
construct
a
cannon
feet
long
the
general
and
the
major
made
some
objections
but
nevertheless
this
proposition
strongly
supported
by
the
secretary
was
definitely
adopted
now
said
elphinstone
what
thickness
must
we
give
its
sides
a
thickness
of
six
feet
answered
barbicane
you
do
not
think
of
raising
such
a
mass
upon
a
asked
the
major
that
would
be
superb
however
said
maston
but
impracticable
answered
barbicane
no
i
think
of
casting
this
engine
in
the
ground
itself
binding
it
up
with
hoops
and
then
surrounding
it
with
a
thick
mass
of
stone
and
cement
masonry
when
it
is
cast
it
must
be
bored
with
great
precision
so
as
to
prevent
windage
so
there
will
be
no
loss
of
gas
and
all
the
expansive
force
of
the
powder
will
be
employed
in
the
propulsion
hurrah
hurrah
said
maston
we
have
our
cannon
not
yet
answered
barbicane
calming
his
impatient
friend
with
his
hand
why
not
because
we
have
not
discussed
its
form
shall
it
be
a
cannon
howitzer
or
a
mortar
a
cannon
replied
morgan
a
howitzer
said
the
major
a
mortar
exclaimed
maston
a
fresh
discussion
was
pending
each
taking
the
part
of
his
favourite
weapon
when
the
president
stopped
it
short
my
friends
said
he
i
will
soon
make
you
agree
our
columbiad
will
be
a
mixture
of
all
three
it
will
be
a
cannon
because
the
will
have
the
same
diameter
as
the
chamber
it
will
be
a
howitzer
because
it
will
hurl
an
obus
lastly
it
will
be
a
mortar
because
it
will
be
pointed
at
an
angle
of
and
that
without
any
chance
of
recoil
unalterably
fixed
to
the
ground
it
will
communicate
to
the
projectile
all
the
power
of
impulsion
accumulated
in
its
body
adopted
adopted
answered
the
members
of
the
committee
one
question
said
elphinstone
and
will
this
be
rifled
no
answered
barbicane
no
we
must
have
an
enormous
initial
speed
and
you
know
very
well
that
a
shot
leaves
a
rifle
less
rapidly
than
a
true
answered
the
major
well
we
have
it
this
time
repeated
maston
not
quite
yet
replied
the
president
why
not
because
we
do
not
yet
know
of
what
metal
it
will
be
made
let
us
decide
that
without
delay
i
was
going
to
propose
it
to
you
the
four
members
of
the
committee
each
swallowed
a
dozen
sandwiches
followed
by
a
cup
of
tea
and
the
debate
recommenced
our
cannon
said
barbicane
must
be
possessed
of
great
tenacity
great
hardness
it
must
be
infusible
by
heat
indissoluble
and
inoxydable
by
the
corrosive
action
of
acids
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
answered
the
major
and
as
we
shall
have
to
employ
a
considerable
quantity
of
metal
we
shall
not
have
much
choice
well
then
said
morgan
i
propose
for
the
fabrication
of
the
columbiad
the
best
alloy
hitherto
known
that
is
to
say
parts
of
copper
of
tin
and
of
brass
my
friends
answered
the
president
i
agree
that
this
composition
has
given
excellent
results
but
in
bulk
it
would
be
too
dear
and
very
hard
to
work
i
therefore
think
we
must
adopt
an
excellent
material
but
cheap
such
as
is
not
that
your
opinion
major
quite
answered
elphinstone
in
fact
resumed
barbicane
costs
ten
times
less
than
bronze
it
is
easily
melted
it
is
readily
run
into
sand
moulds
and
is
rapidly
manipulated
it
is
therefore
an
economy
of
money
and
time
besides
that
material
is
excellent
and
i
remember
that
during
the
war
at
the
siege
of
atlanta
cannon
fired
a
thousand
shots
each
every
twenty
minutes
without
being
damaged
by
it
yet
is
very
brittle
answered
morgan
yes
but
it
possesses
resistance
too
besides
we
shall
not
let
it
explode
i
can
answer
for
that
it
is
possible
to
explode
and
yet
be
honest
replied
maston
sententiously
evidently
answered
barbicane
i
am
therefore
going
to
beg
our
worthy
secretary
to
calculate
the
weight
of
a
cannon
feet
long
with
an
inner
diameter
of
nine
feet
and
sides
six
feet
thick
at
once
answered
maston
and
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
he
made
his
calculations
with
marvellous
facility
and
said
at
the
end
of
a
minute
this
cannon
will
weigh
tons
and
how
much
will
that
cost
at
two
cents
a
pound
two
million
five
hundred
and
ten
thousand
seven
hundred
and
one
dollars
maston
the
major
and
the
general
looked
at
barbicane
anxiously
well
gentlemen
said
the
president
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
said
to
you
yesterday
do
be
uneasy
we
shall
not
want
for
money
upon
this
assurance
of
its
president
the
committee
broke
up
after
having
fixed
a
third
meeting
for
the
next
evening
chapter
ix
the
question
of
powders
the
question
of
powder
still
remained
to
be
settled
the
public
awaited
this
last
decision
with
anxiety
the
size
of
the
projectile
and
length
of
the
cannon
being
given
what
would
be
the
quantity
of
powder
necessary
to
produce
the
impulsion
this
terrible
agent
of
which
however
man
has
made
himself
master
was
destined
to
play
a
part
in
unusual
proportions
it
is
generally
known
and
often
asserted
that
gunpowder
was
invented
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
the
monk
schwartz
who
paid
for
his
great
discovery
with
his
life
but
it
is
nearly
proved
now
that
this
story
must
be
ranked
among
the
legends
of
the
middle
ages
gunpowder
was
invented
by
no
one
it
is
a
direct
product
of
greek
fire
composed
like
it
of
sulphur
and
saltpetre
only
since
that
epoch
these
mixtures
which
were
only
dissolving
have
been
transformed
into
detonating
mixtures
but
if
learned
men
know
perfectly
the
false
history
of
gunpowder
few
people
are
aware
of
its
mechanical
power
now
this
is
necessary
to
be
known
in
order
to
understand
the
importance
of
the
question
submitted
to
the
committee
thus
a
litre
of
gunpowder
weighs
about
lbs
it
produces
by
burning
about
litres
of
gas
this
gas
liberated
and
under
the
action
of
a
temperature
of
occupies
the
space
of
litres
therefore
the
volume
of
powder
is
to
the
volume
of
gas
produced
by
its
deflagration
as
to
the
frightful
force
of
this
gas
when
it
is
compressed
into
a
space
times
too
small
may
be
imagined
this
is
what
the
members
of
the
committee
knew
perfectly
when
the
next
day
they
began
their
sitting
major
elphinstone
opened
the
debate
my
dear
comrades
said
the
distinguished
chemist
i
am
going
to
begin
with
some
unexceptionable
figures
which
will
serve
as
a
basis
for
our
calculation
the
of
which
the
hon
maston
spoke
the
day
before
yesterday
is
driven
out
of
the
cannon
by
lbs
of
powder
only
you
are
certain
of
your
figures
asked
barbicane
absolutely
certain
answered
the
major
the
armstrong
cannon
only
uses
lbs
of
powder
for
a
projectile
of
and
the
rodman
columbiad
only
expends
lbs
of
powder
to
send
its
bullet
six
miles
these
facts
can
not
be
doubted
for
i
found
them
myself
in
the
reports
of
the
committee
of
artillery
that
is
certain
answered
the
general
well
resumed
the
major
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
these
figures
is
that
the
quantity
of
powder
does
not
augment
with
the
weight
of
the
shot
in
fact
if
a
shot
of
lbs
took
lbs
of
powder
and
in
other
terms
if
in
ordinary
cannons
a
quantity
of
powder
weighing
of
the
weight
of
the
projectile
is
used
this
proportion
is
not
always
necessary
calculate
and
you
will
see
that
for
the
shot
of
half
a
ton
weight
instead
of
lbs
of
powder
this
quantity
has
been
reduced
to
lbs
only
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
the
president
the
extreme
of
your
theory
my
dear
major
said
maston
would
bring
you
to
having
no
powder
at
all
provided
your
shot
were
sufficiently
heavy
friend
maston
will
have
his
joke
even
in
the
most
serious
things
replied
the
major
but
he
need
not
be
uneasy
i
shall
soon
propose
a
quantity
of
powder
that
will
satisfy
him
only
i
wish
to
have
it
understood
that
during
the
war
and
for
the
largest
guns
the
weight
of
the
powder
was
reduced
after
experience
to
a
tenth
of
the
weight
of
the
shot
nothing
is
more
exact
said
morgan
but
before
deciding
the
quantity
of
powder
necessary
to
give
the
impulsion
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
agree
upon
its
nature
we
shall
use
a
powder
answered
the
major
its
deflagration
is
the
most
rapid
no
doubt
replied
morgan
but
it
is
very
brittle
and
ends
by
damaging
the
chamber
of
the
gun
certainly
but
what
would
be
bad
for
a
gun
destined
for
long
service
would
not
be
so
for
our
columbiad
we
run
no
danger
of
explosion
and
the
powder
must
immediately
take
fire
to
make
its
mechanical
effect
complete
we
might
make
several
touchholes
said
maston
so
as
to
set
fire
to
it
in
several
places
at
the
same
time
no
doubt
answered
elphinstone
but
that
would
make
the
working
of
it
more
difficult
i
therefore
come
back
to
my
powder
that
removes
these
difficulties
so
be
it
answered
the
general
to
load
his
columbiad
resumed
the
major
rodman
used
a
powder
in
grains
as
large
as
chestnuts
made
of
willow
charcoal
simply
rarefied
in
pans
this
powder
was
hard
and
shining
left
no
stain
on
the
hands
contained
a
great
proportion
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
deflagrated
instantaneously
and
though
very
brittle
did
not
much
damage
the
mouthpiece
well
it
seems
to
me
answered
maston
that
we
have
nothing
to
hesitate
about
and
that
our
choice
is
made
unless
you
prefer
replied
the
major
laughing
which
provoked
a
threatening
gesture
from
the
steel
hook
of
his
susceptible
friend
until
then
barbicane
had
kept
himself
aloof
from
the
discussion
he
listened
and
had
evidently
an
idea
he
contented
himself
with
saying
simply
now
my
friends
what
quantity
of
powder
do
you
propose
the
three
members
of
the
gun
club
looked
at
one
another
for
the
space
of
a
minute
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
said
morgan
at
last
five
hundred
thousand
replied
the
major
eight
hundred
thousand
exclaimed
maston
this
time
elphinstone
dared
not
tax
his
colleague
with
exaggeration
in
fact
the
question
was
that
of
sending
to
the
moon
a
projectile
weighing
and
of
giving
it
an
initial
force
of
yards
a
second
a
moment
of
silence
therefore
followed
the
triple
proposition
made
by
the
three
colleagues
it
was
at
last
broken
by
president
barbicane
my
brave
comrades
said
he
in
a
quiet
tone
i
start
from
this
principle
that
the
resistance
of
our
cannon
in
the
given
conditions
is
unlimited
i
shall
therefore
surprise
the
honourable
maston
when
i
tell
him
that
he
has
been
timid
in
his
calculations
and
i
propose
to
double
his
lbs
of
powder
sixteen
hundred
thousand
pounds
shouted
maston
jumping
out
of
his
chair
quite
as
much
as
that
then
we
shall
have
to
come
back
to
my
cannon
half
a
mile
long
it
is
evident
said
the
major
sixteen
hundred
thousand
pounds
of
powder
resumed
the
secretary
of
committee
will
occupy
about
a
space
of
cubic
feet
now
as
your
cannon
will
only
hold
about
cubic
feet
it
will
be
half
full
and
the
chamber
will
not
be
long
enough
to
allow
the
explosion
of
the
gas
to
give
sufficient
impulsion
to
your
projectile
there
was
nothing
to
answer
maston
spoke
the
truth
they
all
looked
at
barbicane
however
resumed
the
president
i
hold
to
that
quantity
of
powder
think
pounds
of
powder
will
give
litres
of
gas
then
how
is
it
to
be
done
asked
the
general
it
is
very
simple
we
must
reduce
this
enormous
quantity
of
powder
keeping
at
the
same
time
its
mechanical
power
good
by
what
means
i
will
tell
you
answered
barbicane
simply
his
interlocutors
all
looked
at
him
nothing
is
easier
in
fact
he
resumed
than
to
bring
that
mass
of
powder
to
a
volume
four
times
less
you
all
know
that
curious
cellular
matter
which
constitutes
the
elementary
tissues
of
vegetables
ah
said
the
major
i
understand
you
barbicane
this
matter
said
the
president
is
obtained
in
perfect
purity
in
different
things
especially
in
cotton
which
is
nothing
but
the
skin
of
the
seeds
of
the
cotton
plant
now
cotton
combined
with
cold
nitric
acid
is
transformed
into
a
substance
eminently
insoluble
eminently
combustible
eminently
explosive
some
years
ago
in
a
french
chemist
braconnot
discovered
this
substance
which
he
called
xyloidine
in
another
frenchman
pelouze
studied
its
different
properties
and
lastly
in
schonbein
professor
of
chemistry
at
basle
proposed
it
as
gunpowder
this
powder
is
nitric
cotton
or
pyroxyle
answered
elphinstone
or
fulminating
cotton
replied
morgan
is
there
not
an
american
name
to
put
at
the
bottom
of
this
discovery
exclaimed
maston
animated
by
a
lively
sentiment
of
patriotism
not
one
unfortunately
replied
the
major
nevertheless
to
satisfy
maston
resumed
the
president
i
may
tell
him
that
one
of
our
may
be
annexed
to
the
study
of
the
celluosity
for
collodion
which
is
one
of
the
principal
agents
in
photography
is
simply
pyroxyle
dissolved
in
ether
to
which
alcohol
has
been
added
and
it
was
discovered
by
maynard
then
a
medical
student
hurrah
for
maynard
and
fulminating
cotton
cried
the
noisy
secretary
of
the
gun
club
i
return
to
pyroxyle
resumed
barbicane
you
are
acquainted
with
its
properties
which
make
it
so
precious
to
us
it
is
prepared
with
the
greatest
facility
cotton
plunged
in
smoking
nitric
acid
for
fifteen
minutes
then
washed
in
water
then
dried
and
that
is
all
nothing
is
more
simple
certainty
said
morgan
what
is
more
pyroxyle
is
not
damaged
by
moisture
a
precious
quality
in
our
eyes
as
it
will
take
several
days
to
load
the
cannon
its
inflammability
takes
place
at
instead
of
at
and
its
deflagration
is
so
immediate
that
it
may
be
fired
on
ordinary
gunpowder
before
the
latter
has
time
to
catch
fire
too
perfect
answered
the
major
only
it
will
cost
more
what
does
that
matter
said
maston
lastly
it
communicates
to
projectiles
a
speed
four
times
greater
than
that
of
gunpowder
i
may
even
add
that
if
of
its
weight
of
nitrate
of
potash
is
added
its
expansive
force
is
still
greatly
augmented
will
that
be
necessary
asked
the
major
i
do
not
think
so
answered
barbicane
thus
instead
of
lbs
of
powder
we
shall
only
have
lbs
of
fulminating
cotton
and
as
we
can
without
danger
compress
lbs
of
cotton
into
cubic
feet
that
quantity
will
not
take
up
more
than
feet
in
the
chamber
of
the
columbiad
by
these
means
the
projectile
will
have
more
than
feet
of
chamber
to
traverse
under
a
force
of
of
litres
of
gas
before
taking
its
flight
over
the
queen
of
night
here
maston
could
not
contain
his
emotion
he
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
friend
with
the
violence
of
a
projectile
and
he
would
have
been
stove
in
had
he
not
have
been
bombproof
this
incident
ended
the
first
sitting
of
the
committee
barbicane
and
his
enterprising
colleagues
to
whom
nothing
seemed
impossible
had
just
solved
the
complex
question
of
the
projectile
cannon
and
powder
their
plan
being
made
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
put
it
into
execution
chapter
x
one
enemy
against
millions
of
friends
the
american
public
took
great
interest
in
the
least
details
of
the
gun
club
enterprise
it
followed
the
committee
debates
day
by
day
the
most
simple
preparations
for
this
great
experiment
the
questions
of
figures
it
provoked
the
mechanical
difficulties
to
be
solved
all
excited
popular
opinion
to
the
highest
pitch
more
than
a
year
would
elapse
between
the
commencement
of
the
work
and
its
completion
but
the
interval
would
not
be
void
of
excitement
the
place
to
be
chosen
for
the
boring
the
casting
the
metal
of
the
columbiad
its
perilous
loading
all
this
was
more
than
necessary
to
excite
public
curiosity
the
projectile
once
fired
would
be
out
of
sight
in
a
few
seconds
then
what
would
become
of
it
how
it
would
behave
in
space
how
it
would
reach
the
moon
none
but
a
few
privileged
persons
would
see
with
their
own
eyes
thus
then
the
preparations
for
the
experiment
and
the
precise
details
of
its
execution
constituted
the
real
source
of
interest
in
the
meantime
the
purely
scientific
attraction
of
the
enterprise
was
all
at
once
heightened
by
an
incident
it
is
known
what
numerous
legions
of
admirers
and
friends
the
barbicane
project
had
called
round
its
author
but
notwithstanding
the
number
and
importance
of
the
majority
it
was
not
destined
to
be
unanimous
one
man
one
out
of
all
the
united
states
protested
against
the
gun
club
he
attacked
it
violently
on
every
occasion
and
for
human
nature
is
thus
constituted
barbicane
was
more
sensitive
to
this
one
opposition
than
to
the
applause
of
all
the
others
nevertheless
he
well
knew
the
motive
of
this
antipathy
from
whence
came
this
solitary
enmity
why
it
was
personal
and
of
ancient
date
lastly
in
what
rivalry
it
had
taken
root
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
never
seen
this
persevering
enemy
happily
for
the
meeting
of
the
two
men
would
certainly
have
had
disastrous
consequences
this
rival
was
a
like
barbicane
a
proud
enterprising
determined
and
violent
character
a
pure
yankee
his
name
was
captain
nicholl
he
lived
in
philadelphia
no
one
is
ignorant
of
the
curious
struggle
which
went
on
during
the
federal
war
between
the
projectile
and
ironclad
vessels
the
former
destined
to
pierce
the
latter
the
latter
determined
not
to
be
pierced
thence
came
a
radical
transformation
in
the
navies
of
the
two
continents
and
iron
plates
struggled
for
supremacy
the
former
getting
larger
as
the
latter
got
thicker
ships
armed
with
formidable
guns
went
into
the
fire
under
shelter
of
their
invulnerable
armour
the
merrimac
monitor
ram
tennessee
and
wechhausen
shot
enormous
projectiles
after
having
made
themselves
proof
against
the
projectiles
of
other
ships
they
did
to
others
what
they
would
not
have
others
do
to
them
an
immoral
principle
upon
which
the
whole
art
of
war
is
based
now
barbicane
was
a
great
caster
of
projectiles
and
nicholl
was
an
equally
great
forger
of
the
one
cast
night
and
day
at
baltimore
the
other
forged
day
and
night
at
philadelphia
each
followed
an
essentially
different
current
of
ideas
as
soon
as
barbicane
had
invented
a
new
projectile
nicholl
invented
a
new
plate
armour
the
president
of
the
gun
club
passed
his
life
in
piercing
holes
the
captain
in
preventing
him
doing
it
hence
a
constant
rivalry
which
even
touched
their
persons
nicholl
appeared
in
barbicane
dreams
as
an
impenetrable
ironclad
against
which
he
split
and
barbicane
in
nicholl
dreams
appeared
like
a
projectile
which
ripped
him
up
still
although
they
ran
along
two
diverging
lines
these
would
have
ended
by
meeting
each
other
in
spite
of
all
the
axioms
in
geometry
but
then
it
would
have
been
on
a
duel
field
happily
for
these
worthy
citizens
so
useful
to
their
country
a
distance
of
from
fifty
to
sixty
miles
separated
them
and
their
friends
put
such
obstacles
in
the
way
that
they
never
met
at
present
it
was
not
clearly
known
which
of
the
two
inventors
held
the
palm
the
results
obtained
rendered
a
just
decision
difficult
it
seemed
however
that
in
the
end
would
have
to
give
way
to
projectiles
nevertheless
competent
men
had
their
doubts
at
the
latest
experiments
the
shots
of
barbicane
had
no
more
effect
than
pins
upon
nicholl
that
day
the
forger
of
philadelphia
believed
himself
victorious
and
henceforth
had
nothing
but
disdain
for
his
rival
but
when
later
on
barbicane
substituted
simple
howitzers
of
lbs
for
conical
shots
the
captain
was
obliged
to
go
down
in
his
own
estimation
it
fact
these
projectiles
though
of
mediocre
velocity
drilled
with
holes
and
broke
to
pieces
of
the
best
metal
things
had
reached
this
point
and
victory
seemed
to
rest
with
the
projectile
when
the
war
ended
the
very
day
that
nicholl
terminated
a
new
forged
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
its
kind
it
defied
all
the
projectiles
in
the
world
the
captain
had
it
taken
to
the
washington
polygon
and
challenged
the
president
of
the
gun
club
to
pierce
it
barbicane
peace
having
been
made
would
not
attempt
the
experiment
then
nicholl
in
a
rage
offered
to
expose
his
to
the
shock
of
any
kind
of
projectile
solid
hollow
round
or
conical
the
president
who
was
determined
not
to
compromise
his
last
success
refused
nicholl
excited
by
this
unqualified
obstinacy
tried
to
tempt
barbicane
by
leaving
him
every
advantage
he
proposed
to
put
his
plate
yards
from
the
gun
barbicane
still
refused
at
yards
not
even
at
at
then
cried
the
captain
through
the
newspapers
at
yards
from
my
plate
and
i
will
be
behind
it
barbicane
answered
that
even
if
captain
nicholl
would
be
in
front
of
it
he
would
not
fire
any
more
on
this
reply
nicholl
could
no
longer
contain
himself
he
had
recourse
to
personalities
he
insinuated
cowardice
that
the
man
who
refuses
to
fire
a
shot
from
a
cannon
is
very
nearly
being
afraid
of
it
that
in
short
the
artillerymen
who
fight
now
at
six
miles
distance
have
prudently
substituted
mathematical
formulae
for
individual
courage
and
that
there
is
as
much
bravery
required
to
quietly
wait
for
a
behind
as
to
send
it
according
to
all
the
rules
of
science
to
these
insinuations
barbicane
answered
nothing
perhaps
he
never
knew
about
them
for
the
calculations
of
his
great
enterprise
absorbed
him
entirely
when
he
made
his
famous
communication
to
the
gun
club
the
anger
of
captain
nicholl
reached
its
maximum
mixed
with
it
was
supreme
jealousy
and
a
sentiment
of
absolute
powerlessness
how
could
he
invent
anything
better
than
a
columbiad
feet
long
what
could
ever
resist
a
projectile
of
nicholl
was
at
first
crushed
by
this
then
he
recovered
and
resolved
to
crush
the
proposition
by
the
weight
of
his
best
arguments
he
therefore
violently
attacked
the
labours
of
the
gun
club
he
sent
a
number
of
letters
to
the
newspapers
which
they
did
not
refuse
to
publish
he
tried
to
demolish
barbicane
work
scientifically
once
the
war
begun
he
called
reasons
of
every
kind
to
his
aid
reasons
it
must
be
acknowledged
often
specious
and
of
bad
metal
firstly
barbicane
was
violently
attacked
about
his
figures
nicholl
tried
to
prove
by
a
b
the
falseness
of
his
formulae
and
he
accused
him
of
being
ignorant
of
the
rudimentary
principles
of
ballistics
amongst
other
errors
and
according
to
nicholl
own
calculations
it
was
impossible
to
give
any
body
a
velocity
of
yards
a
second
he
sustained
algebra
in
hand
that
even
with
that
velocity
a
projectile
thus
heavy
would
never
pass
the
limits
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
it
would
not
even
go
eight
leagues
better
still
granted
the
velocity
and
taking
it
as
sufficient
the
shot
would
not
resist
the
pressure
of
the
gas
developed
by
the
combustion
of
pounds
of
powder
and
even
if
it
did
resist
that
pressure
it
at
least
would
not
support
such
a
temperature
it
would
melt
as
it
issued
from
the
columbiad
and
would
fall
in
rain
on
the
heads
of
the
imprudent
spectators
barbicane
paid
no
attention
to
these
attacks
and
went
on
with
his
work
then
nicholl
considered
the
question
in
its
other
aspects
without
speaking
of
its
uselessness
from
all
other
points
of
view
he
looked
upon
the
experiment
as
exceedingly
dangerous
both
for
the
citizens
who
authorised
so
condemnable
a
spectacle
by
their
presence
and
for
the
towns
near
the
deplorable
cannon
he
also
remarked
that
if
the
projectile
did
not
reach
its
destination
a
result
absolutely
impossible
it
was
evident
that
it
would
fall
on
to
the
earth
again
and
that
the
fall
of
such
a
mass
multiplied
by
the
square
of
its
velocity
would
singularly
damage
some
point
on
the
globe
therefore
in
such
a
circumstance
and
without
any
restriction
being
put
upon
the
rights
of
free
citizens
it
was
one
of
those
cases
in
which
the
intervention
of
government
became
necessary
and
the
safety
of
all
must
not
be
endangered
for
the
good
pleasure
of
a
single
individual
it
will
be
seen
to
what
exaggeration
captain
nicholl
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
he
was
alone
in
his
opinion
nobody
took
any
notice
of
his
cassandra
prophecies
they
let
him
exclaim
as
much
as
he
liked
till
his
throat
was
sore
if
he
pleased
he
had
constituted
himself
the
defender
of
a
cause
lost
in
advance
he
was
heard
but
not
listened
to
and
he
did
not
carry
off
a
single
admirer
from
the
president
of
the
gun
club
who
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
refute
his
rival
arguments
nicholl
driven
into
his
last
intrenchments
and
not
being
able
to
fight
for
his
opinion
resolved
to
pay
for
it
he
therefore
proposed
in
the
a
series
of
bets
conceived
in
these
terms
and
in
an
increasing
proportion
he
bet
that
the
funds
necessary
for
the
gun
club
enterprise
would
not
be
forthcoming
dols
that
the
casting
of
a
cannon
of
feet
was
impracticable
and
would
not
succeed
dols
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
load
the
columbiad
and
that
the
pyroxyle
would
ignite
spontaneously
under
the
weight
of
the
projectile
dols
that
the
columbiad
would
burst
at
the
first
discharge
dols
that
the
projectile
would
not
even
go
six
miles
and
would
fall
a
few
seconds
after
its
discharge
dols
it
will
be
seen
that
the
captain
was
risking
an
important
sum
in
his
invincible
obstinacy
no
less
than
dols
were
at
stake
notwithstanding
the
importance
of
the
wager
he
received
on
the
of
october
a
sealed
packet
of
superb
laconism
couched
in
these
terms
baltimore
october
done
barbicane
chapter
xi
florida
and
texas
there
still
remained
one
question
to
be
decided
a
place
favourable
to
the
experiment
had
to
be
chosen
according
to
the
recommendation
of
the
cambridge
observatory
the
gun
must
be
aimed
perpendicularly
to
the
plane
of
the
horizon
that
is
to
say
towards
the
zenith
now
the
moon
only
appears
in
the
zenith
in
the
places
situated
between
and
of
latitude
or
in
other
terms
when
her
declination
is
only
the
question
was
therefore
to
determine
the
exact
point
of
the
globe
where
the
immense
columbiad
should
be
cast
on
the
of
october
the
gun
club
held
a
general
meeting
barbicane
brought
a
magnificent
map
of
the
united
states
by
belltropp
but
before
he
had
time
to
unfold
it
maston
rose
with
his
habitual
vehemence
and
began
to
speak
as
follows
honourable
colleagues
the
question
we
are
to
settle
is
really
of
national
importance
and
will
furnish
us
with
an
occasion
for
doing
a
great
act
of
patriotism
the
members
of
the
gun
club
looked
at
each
other
without
understanding
what
the
orator
was
coming
to
not
one
of
you
he
continued
would
think
of
doing
anything
to
lessen
the
glory
of
his
country
and
if
there
is
one
right
that
the
union
may
claim
it
is
that
of
harbouring
in
its
bosom
the
formidable
cannon
of
the
gun
club
now
under
the
present
circumstances
will
you
allow
me
said
barbicane
i
demand
the
free
discussion
of
ideas
replied
the
impetuous
maston
and
i
maintain
that
the
territory
from
which
our
glorious
projectile
will
rise
ought
to
belong
to
the
union
certainly
answered
several
members
well
then
as
our
frontiers
do
not
stretch
far
enough
as
on
the
south
the
ocean
is
our
limit
as
we
must
seek
beyond
the
united
states
and
in
a
neighbouring
country
this
parallel
this
is
all
a
legitimate
and
i
demand
that
war
should
be
declared
against
mexico
no
no
was
cried
from
all
parts
no
replied
maston
i
am
much
astonished
at
hearing
such
a
word
in
these
precincts
but
listen
never
never
cried
the
fiery
orator
sooner
or
later
this
war
will
be
declared
and
i
demand
that
it
should
be
this
very
day
maston
said
barbicane
making
his
bell
go
off
with
a
crash
i
agree
with
you
that
the
experiment
can
not
and
ought
not
to
be
made
anywhere
but
on
the
soil
of
the
union
but
if
i
had
been
allowed
to
speak
before
and
you
had
glanced
at
this
map
you
would
know
that
it
is
perfectly
useless
to
declare
war
against
our
neighbours
for
certain
frontiers
of
the
united
states
extend
beyond
the
parallel
look
we
have
at
our
disposition
all
the
southern
part
of
texas
and
florida
this
incident
had
no
consequences
still
it
was
not
without
regret
that
maston
allowed
himself
to
be
convinced
it
was
therefore
decided
that
the
columbiad
should
be
cast
either
on
the
soil
of
texas
or
on
that
of
florida
but
this
decision
was
destined
to
create
an
unexampled
rivalry
between
the
towns
of
these
two
states
the
parallel
when
it
touches
the
american
coast
crosses
the
peninsula
of
florida
and
divides
it
into
two
nearly
equal
portions
then
plunging
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
subtends
the
arc
formed
by
the
coasts
of
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
then
skirting
texas
off
which
it
cuts
an
angle
it
continues
its
direction
over
mexico
crosses
the
sonora
and
old
california
and
loses
itself
in
the
pacific
ocean
therefore
only
the
portions
of
texas
and
florida
situated
below
this
parallel
fulfilled
the
requisite
conditions
of
latitude
recommended
by
the
observatory
of
cambridge
the
southern
portion
of
florida
contains
no
important
cities
it
only
bristles
with
forts
raised
against
wandering
indians
one
town
only
tampa
town
could
put
in
a
claim
in
favour
of
its
position
in
texas
on
the
contrary
towns
are
more
numerous
and
more
important
corpus
christi
in
the
county
of
nuaces
and
all
the
cities
situated
on
the
rio
bravo
laredo
comalites
san
ignacio
in
web
rio
grande
city
in
starr
edinburgh
in
hidalgo
el
panda
and
brownsville
in
cameron
formed
a
powerful
league
against
the
pretensions
of
florida
the
decision
therefore
was
hardly
made
public
before
the
floridan
and
texican
deputies
flocked
to
baltimore
by
the
shortest
way
from
that
moment
president
barbicane
and
the
influential
members
of
the
gun
club
were
besieged
day
and
night
by
formidable
claims
if
seven
towns
of
greece
contended
for
the
honour
of
being
homer
birthplace
two
entire
states
threatened
to
fight
over
a
cannon
these
rival
parties
were
then
seen
marching
with
weapons
about
the
streets
of
the
town
every
time
they
met
a
fight
was
imminent
which
would
have
had
disastrous
consequences
happily
the
prudence
and
skill
of
president
barbicane
warded
off
this
danger
personal
demonstrations
found
an
outlet
in
the
newspapers
of
the
different
states
it
was
thus
that
the
york
and
the
supported
the
claims
of
texas
whilst
the
and
the
took
the
part
of
the
floridan
deputies
the
members
of
the
gun
club
did
not
know
which
to
listen
to
texas
came
up
proudly
with
its
counties
which
it
seemed
to
put
in
array
but
florida
answered
that
twelve
counties
proved
more
than
in
a
country
six
times
smaller
texas
bragged
of
its
inhabitants
but
florida
much
smaller
boasted
of
being
much
more
densely
populated
with
besides
florida
accused
texas
of
being
the
home
of
paludian
fevers
which
carried
off
one
year
with
another
several
thousands
of
inhabitants
and
florida
was
not
far
wrong
in
its
turn
texas
replied
that
florida
need
not
envy
its
fevers
and
that
it
was
at
least
imprudent
to
call
other
countries
unhealthy
when
florida
itself
had
chronic
vomito
negro
and
texas
was
not
far
wrong
besides
added
the
texicans
through
the
york
there
are
rights
due
to
a
state
that
grows
the
best
cotton
in
all
america
a
state
which
produces
holm
oak
for
building
ships
a
state
that
contains
superb
coal
and
mines
of
iron
that
yield
fifty
per
cent
of
pure
to
that
the
answered
that
the
soil
of
florida
though
not
so
rich
offered
better
conditions
for
the
casting
of
the
columbiad
as
it
was
composed
of
sand
and
but
answered
the
texicans
before
anything
can
be
cast
in
a
place
it
must
get
to
that
place
now
communication
with
florida
is
difficult
whilst
the
coast
of
texas
offers
galveston
bay
which
is
fourteen
leagues
round
and
could
contain
all
the
fleets
in
the
world
why
replied
the
newspapers
devoted
to
florida
your
galveston
bay
is
situated
above
the
parallel
whilst
our
bay
of
opens
precisely
at
the
degree
of
latitude
and
by
it
ships
go
direct
to
tampa
town
a
nice
bay
truly
answered
texas
it
is
up
with
sand
any
one
would
think
to
hear
you
talk
cried
florida
that
i
was
a
savage
country
well
the
seminoles
do
still
wander
over
your
prairies
and
what
about
your
apaches
and
your
comanches
are
they
civilised
the
war
had
been
thus
kept
up
for
some
days
when
florida
tried
to
draw
her
adversary
upon
another
ground
and
one
morning
the
insinuated
that
the
enterprise
being
essentially
american
it
ought
only
to
be
attempted
upon
an
essentially
american
territory
at
these
words
texas
could
not
contain
itself
american
it
cried
are
we
not
as
american
as
you
were
not
texas
and
florida
both
incorporated
in
the
union
in
certainly
answered
the
but
we
have
belonged
to
america
since
yes
replied
the
after
having
been
spanish
or
english
for
years
you
were
sold
to
the
united
states
for
of
dollars
what
does
that
matter
answered
florida
need
we
blush
for
that
was
not
louisiana
bought
in
from
napoleon
for
of
dollars
it
is
shameful
then
cried
the
texican
deputies
a
miserable
slice
of
land
like
florida
to
dare
to
compare
itself
with
texas
which
instead
of
being
sold
made
itself
independent
which
drove
out
the
mexicans
on
the
of
march
which
declared
itself
federative
republican
after
the
victory
gained
by
samuel
houston
on
the
banks
of
the
san
jacinto
over
the
troops
of
a
country
in
short
which
voluntarily
joined
itself
to
the
united
states
of
america
because
it
was
afraid
of
the
mexicans
answered
florida
afraid
from
the
day
this
word
really
too
cutting
was
pronounced
the
situation
became
intolerable
an
engagement
was
expected
between
the
two
parties
in
the
streets
of
baltimore
the
deputies
were
obliged
to
be
watched
president
barbicane
was
half
driven
wild
notes
documents
and
letters
full
of
threats
inundated
his
house
which
course
ought
he
to
decide
upon
in
the
point
of
view
of
fitness
of
soil
facility
of
communications
and
rapidity
of
transport
the
rights
of
the
two
states
were
really
equal
as
to
the
political
personalities
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
now
this
hesitation
and
embarrassment
had
already
lasted
some
time
when
barbicane
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
called
his
colleagues
together
and
the
solution
he
proposed
to
them
was
a
profoundly
wise
one
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
after
due
consideration
said
he
of
all
that
has
just
occurred
between
florida
and
texas
it
is
evident
that
the
same
difficulties
will
again
crop
up
between
the
towns
of
the
favoured
state
the
rivalry
will
be
changed
from
state
to
city
and
that
is
all
now
texas
contains
eleven
towns
with
the
requisite
conditions
that
will
dispute
the
honour
of
the
enterprise
and
that
will
create
fresh
troubles
for
us
whilst
florida
has
but
one
therefore
i
decide
for
tampa
town
the
texican
deputies
were
thunderstruck
at
this
decision
it
put
them
into
a
terrible
rage
and
they
sent
nominal
provocations
to
different
members
of
the
gun
club
there
was
only
one
course
for
the
magistrates
of
baltimore
to
take
and
they
took
it
they
had
the
steam
of
a
special
train
got
up
packed
the
texicans
into
it
whether
they
would
or
no
and
sent
them
away
from
the
town
at
a
speed
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
but
they
were
not
carried
off
too
quickly
to
hurl
a
last
and
threatening
sarcasm
at
their
adversaries
making
allusion
to
the
width
of
florida
a
simple
peninsula
between
two
seas
they
pretended
it
would
not
resist
the
shock
and
would
be
blown
up
the
first
time
the
cannon
was
fired
very
well
let
it
be
blown
up
answered
the
floridans
with
a
laconism
worthy
of
ancient
times
chapter
xii
urbi
et
orbi
the
astronomical
mechanical
and
topographical
difficulties
once
removed
there
remained
the
question
of
money
an
enormous
sum
was
necessary
for
the
execution
of
the
project
no
private
individual
no
single
state
even
could
have
disposed
of
the
necessary
millions
president
barbicane
had
resolved
although
the
enterprise
was
american
to
make
it
a
business
of
universal
interest
and
to
ask
every
nation
for
its
financial
it
was
the
bounded
right
and
duty
of
all
the
earth
to
interfere
in
the
business
of
the
satellite
the
subscription
opened
at
baltimore
for
this
end
extended
thence
to
all
the
world
et
this
subscription
was
destined
to
succeed
beyond
all
hope
yet
the
money
was
to
be
given
not
lent
the
operation
was
purely
disinterested
in
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word
and
offered
no
chance
of
gain
but
the
effect
of
barbicane
communication
had
not
stopped
at
the
frontiers
of
the
united
states
it
had
crossed
the
atlantic
and
pacific
had
invaded
both
asia
and
europe
both
africa
and
oceania
the
observatories
of
the
union
were
immediately
put
into
communication
with
the
observatories
of
foreign
countries
some
those
of
paris
petersburg
the
cape
berlin
altona
stockholm
warsaw
hamburg
buda
bologna
malta
lisbon
benares
madras
and
pekin
sent
their
compliments
to
the
gun
club
the
others
prudently
awaited
the
result
as
to
the
greenwich
observatory
seconded
by
the
astronomical
establishments
of
great
britain
it
made
short
work
of
it
it
boldly
denied
the
possibility
of
success
and
took
up
captain
theories
whilst
the
different
scientific
societies
promised
to
send
deputies
to
tampa
town
the
greenwich
staff
met
and
contemptuously
dismissed
the
barbicane
proposition
this
was
pure
english
jealousy
and
nothing
else
generally
speaking
the
effect
upon
the
world
of
science
was
excellent
and
from
thence
it
passed
to
the
masses
who
in
general
were
greatly
interested
in
the
question
a
fact
of
great
importance
seeing
those
masses
were
to
be
called
upon
to
subscribe
a
considerable
capital
on
the
of
october
president
barbicane
issued
a
manifesto
full
of
enthusiasm
in
which
he
made
appeal
to
all
persons
on
the
face
of
the
earth
willing
to
help
this
document
translated
into
every
language
had
great
success
subscriptions
were
opened
in
the
principal
towns
of
the
union
with
a
central
office
at
the
baltimore
bank

then

dollars
were

in

with
such
a
sum
in
hand
the
gun
club
could
begin
at
once
but
a
few
days
later
telegrams
informed
america
that
foreign
subscriptions
were
pouring
in
rapidly
certain
countries
were
distinguished
by
their
generosity
others
let
go
their
money
less
easily
it
was
a
matter
of
temperament
however
figures
are
more
eloquent
than
words
and
the
following
is
an
official
statement
of
the
sums
paid
to
the
credit
of
the
gun
club
when
the
subscription
was
closed
the
contingent
of
russia
was
the
enormous
sum
of
roubles
this
need
astonish
no
one
who
remembers
the
scientific
taste
of
the
russians
and
the
impetus
which
they
have
given
to
astronomical
studies
thanks
to
their
numerous
observatories
the
principal
of
which
cost
roubles
france
began
by
laughing
at
the
pretensions
of
the
americans
the
moon
served
as
an
excuse
for
a
thousand
stale
puns
and
a
score
of
vaudevilles
in
which
bad
taste
contested
the
palm
with
ignorance
but
as
the
french
formerly
paid
after
singing
they
now
paid
after
laughing
and
subscribed
a
sum
of
francs
at
that
price
they
bought
the
right
to
joke
a
little
austria
in
the
midst
of
her
financial
difficulties
was
sufficiently
generous
her
part
in
the
public
subscription
amounted
to
florins
which
were
welcome
sweden
and
norway
contributed
the
figure
was
small
considering
the
country
but
it
would
certainly
have
been
higher
if
a
subscription
had
been
opened
at
christiania
as
well
as
at
stockholm
for
some
reason
or
other
the
norwegians
do
not
like
to
send
their
money
to
norway
prussia
by
sending
thalers
testified
her
approbation
of
the
enterprise
her
different
observatories
contributed
an
important
sum
and
were
amongst
the
most
ardent
in
encouraging
president
barbicane
turkey
behaved
generously
but
she
was
personally
interested
in
the
business
the
moon
in
fact
rules
the
course
of
her
years
and
her
ramadan
fast
she
could
do
no
less
than
give
piastres
and
she
gave
them
with
an
ardour
that
betrayed
however
a
certain
pressure
from
the
government
of
the
porte
belgium
distinguished
herself
amongst
all
the
second
order
of
states
by
a
gift
of
francs
about
one
penny
and
a
fraction
for
each
inhabitant
holland
and
her
colonies
contributed
florins
only
demanding
a
discount
of
five
per
as
she
paid
ready
money
denmark
rather
confined
for
room
gave
notwithstanding
ducats
proving
her
love
for
scientific
experiments
the
germanic
confederation
subscribed
florins
more
could
not
be
asked
from
her
besides
she
would
not
have
given
more
although
in
embarrassed
circumstances
italy
found
francs
in
her
children
pockets
but
by
turning
them
well
inside
out
if
she
had
then
possessed
venetia
she
would
have
given
more
but
she
did
not
yet
possess
venetia
the
pontifical
states
thought
they
could
not
send
less
than
roman
crowns
and
portugal
pushed
her
devotion
to
the
extent
of
cruzades
mexico
gent
the
widow
mite
piastres
but
empires
in
course
of
formation
are
always
in
rather
embarrassed
circumstances
switzerland
sent
the
modest
sum
of
francs
to
the
american
scheme
it
must
be
frankly
stated
that
switzerland
only
looked
upon
the
practical
side
of
the
operation
the
action
of
sending
a
bullet
to
the
moon
did
not
seem
of
a
nature
sufficient
for
the
establishing
of
any
communication
with
the
queen
of
night
so
switzerland
thought
it
imprudent
to
engage
capital
in
an
enterprise
depending
upon
such
uncertain
events
after
all
switzerland
was
perhaps
right
as
to
spain
she
found
it
impossible
to
get
together
more
than
reals
she
gave
as
an
excuse
that
she
had
her
railways
to
finish
the
truth
is
that
science
is
not
looked
upon
very
favourably
in
that
country
it
is
still
a
little
behindhand
and
then
certain
spaniards
and
not
the
most
ignorant
either
had
no
clear
conception
of
the
size
of
the
projectile
compared
with
that
of
the
moon
they
feared
it
might
disturb
the
satellite
from
her
orbit
and
make
her
fall
on
to
the
surface
of
the
terrestrial
globe
in
that
case
it
was
better
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
which
they
carried
out
with
that
small
exception
england
alone
remained
the
contemptuous
antipathy
with
which
she
received
barbicane
proposition
is
known
the
english
have
but
a
single
mind
in
their
of
bodies
which
great
britain
contains
they
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
the
enterprise
of
the
gun
club
was
contrary
to
the
principle
of
and
they
did
not
subscribe
a
single
farthing
at
this
news
the
gun
club
contented
itself
with
shrugging
its
shoulders
and
returned
to
its
great
work
when
south
america
that
is
to
say
peru
chili
brazil
the
provinces
of
la
plata
and
columbia
had
poured
into
their
hands
their

at
its

was
made
with

during

had
furnished
parrott

it
was
stipulated
between

that

manufactory
should
pledge
itself
to
send
to
tampa
town
in
south
florida
the
necessary
materials
for
the

this
operation
was

to

in

where
every

knows
how
to

made
it
his

to

never
before
had
the

sold
so
many
travels
in

territory
of
and
on
the
culture
of
the
sugar
cane
in

new
editions
of
these
works
were
required
there
was
quite
a
rage
for
them
barbicane
had
something
better
to
do
than
to
read
he
wished
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
and
choose
the
site
of
the
columbiad
therefore
without
losing
a
moment
he
put
the
funds
necessary
for
the
construction
of
a
telescope
at
the
disposition
of
the
cambridge
observatory
and
made
a
contract
with
the
firm
of
breadwill
and
of
albany
for
the
making
of
the
aluminium
projectile
then
he
left
baltimore
accompanied
by
maston
major
elphinstone
and
the
manager
of
the
goldspring
manufactory
the
next
day
the
four
travelling
companions
reached
new
orleans
there
they
embarked
on
board
the
a
belonging
to
the
federal
navy
which
the
government
had
placed
at
their
disposal
and
with
all
steam
on
they
quickly
lost
sight
of
the
shores
of
louisiana
the
passage
was
not
a
long
one
two
days
after
its
departure
the
having
made
four
hundred
and
eighty
miles
sighted
the
floridian
coast
as
it
approached
barbicane
saw
a
low
flat
coast
looking
rather
unfertile
after
coasting
a
series
of
creeks
rich
in
oysters
and
lobsters
the
entered
the
bay
of
this
bay
is
divided
into
two
long
roadsteads
those
of
tampa
and
hillisboro
the
narrow
entrance
to
which
the
steamer
soon
cleared
a
short
time
afterwards
the
batteries
of
fort
brooke
rose
above
the
waves
and
the
town
of
tampa
appeared
carelessly
lying
on
a
little
natural
harbour
formed
by
the
mouth
of
the
river
hillisboro
there
the
anchored
on
october
at
seven
the
four
passengers
landed
immediately
barbicane
felt
his
heart
beat
violently
as
he
set
foot
on
floridian
soil
he
seemed
to
feel
it
with
his
feet
like
an
architect
trying
the
solidity
of
a
house
maston
scratched
the
ground
with
his
steel
hook
gentlemen
then
said
barbicane
we
have
no
time
to
lose
and
we
will
set
off
on
horseback
to
survey
the
country
the
minute
barbicane
landed
the
three
thousand
inhabitants
of
tampa
town
went
out
to
meet
him
an
honour
quite
due
to
the
president
of
the
gun
club
who
had
decided
in
their
favour
they
received
him
with
formidable
exclamations
but
barbicane
escaped
an
ovation
by
shutting
himself
up
in
his
room
at
the
franklin
hotel
and
refusing
to
see
any
one
the
next
day
october
small
horses
of
spanish
race
full
of
fire
and
vigour
pawed
the
ground
under
his
windows
but
instead
of
four
there
were
fifty
with
their
riders
barbicane
went
down
accompanied
by
his
three
companions
who
were
at
first
astonished
to
find
themselves
in
the
midst
of
such
a
cavalcade
he
remarked
besides
that
each
horseman
carried
a
carbine
slung
across
his
shoulders
and
pistols
in
his
holsters
the
reason
for
such
a
display
of
force
was
immediately
given
him
by
a
young
floridian
who
said
to
him
sir
the
seminoles
are
there
what
seminoles
savages
who
frequent
the
prairies
and
we
deemed
it
prudent
to
give
you
an
escort
pooh
exclaimed
maston
as
he
mounted
his
steed
it
is
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
answered
the
floridian
gentlemen
replied
barbicane
i
thank
you
for
your
attention
and
now
let
us
be
off
the
little
troop
set
out
immediately
and
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
dust
it
was
five
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
already
and
the
thermometer
indicated
but
fresh
sea
breezes
moderated
this
excessive
heat
barbicane
on
leaving
tampa
town
went
down
south
and
followed
the
coast
to
alifia

this
small
river
falls
into
hillisboro

twelve
miles
below
tampa
town
barbicane
and
his
escort
followed
its
right
bank
going
up
towards
the
east
the
waves
of
the
bay
disappeared
behind
an
inequality
in
the
ground
and
the
floridian
country
was
alone
in
sight
florida
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
one
to

populous

less
abandoned

tallahassee

the
principal
marine
arsenals
of
the

the
other
lying
between
the
atlantic
and
the

of

is
only
a
narrow
peninsula
eaten
away
by
the
current
of
the
gulf
stream
a
little
tongue
of
land
lost
amidst
a
small
archipelago
which
the
numerous
vessels
of
the
bahama
channel
double
continually
it
is
the
advanced
sentinel
of

the
superficial
area
of
this
state
measures
acres
amongst
which
one
had
to
be
chosen
situated
beyond
the
parallel
and
suitable
for
the
enterprise
as
barbicane
rode
along
he
attentively
examined
the
configuration
of
the
ground
and
its
particular
distribution
florida
discovered
by
juan
ponce
de
leon
in
on
palm
sunday
was
first
of
all
named
it
was
well
worthy
of
that
designation
with
its
dry
and
arid
coasts
but
a
few
miles
from
the
shore
the
nature
of
the
ground
gradually
changed
and
the
country
showed
itself
worthy
of
its
name
the
soil
was
cut
up
by
a
network
of
creeks
rivers
watercourses
ponds
and
small
lakes
it
might
have
been
mistaken
for
holland
or
guiana
but
the
ground
gradually
rose
and
soon
showed
its
cultivated
plains
where
all
the
vegetables
of
the
north
and
south
grow
in
perfection
its
immense
fields
where
a
tropical
sun
and
the
water
conserved
in
its
clayey
texture
do
all
the
work
of
cultivating
and
lastly
its
prairies
of
pineapples
yams
tobacco
rice
cotton
and
sugarcanes
which
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
spreading
out
their
riches
with
careless
prodigality
barbicane
appeared
greatly
satisfied
on
finding
the
progressive
elevation
of
the
ground
and
when
maston
questioned
him
on
the
subject
my
worthy
friend
said
he
it
is
greatly
to
our
interest
to
cast
our
columbiad
on
elevated
ground
in
order
to
be
nearer
the
moon
exclaimed
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
no
answered
barbicane
smiling
what
can
a
few
yards
more
or
less
matter
no
but
on
elevated
ground
our
work
can
be
accomplished
more
easily
we
shall
not
have
to
struggle
against
water
which
will
save
us
long
and
expensive
tubings
and
that
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
when
a
well
feet
deep
has
to
be
sunk
you
are
right
said
murchison
the
engineer
we
must
as
much
as
possible
avoid
watercourses
during
the
casting
but
if
we
meet
with
springs
they
will
not
matter
much
we
can
exhaust
them
with
our
machines
or
divert
them
from
their
course
here
we
have
not
to
work
at
an
artesian
well
narrow
and
dark
where
all
the
boring
implements
have
to
work
in
the
dark
no
we
can
work
under
the
open
sky
with
spade
and
pickaxe
and
by
the
help
of
blasting
our
work
will
not
take
long
still
resumed
barbicane
if
by
the
elevation
of
the
ground
or
its
nature
we
can
avoid
a
struggle
with
subterranean
waters
we
can
do
our
work
more
rapidly
and
perfectly
we
must
therefore
make
our
cutting
in
ground
situated
some
thousands
of
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
you
are
right
barbicane
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
shall
soon
find
a
suitable
spot
i
should
like
to
see
the
first
spadeful
turned
up
said
the
president
and
i
the
last
exclaimed
maston
we
shall
manage
it
gentlemen
answered
the
engineer
and
believe
me
the
goldspring
company
will
not
have
to
pay
you
any
forfeit
for
delay

it
had
better
not
replied
maston

conditions
that
is
to
say
for
eighteen

eleven

you
know
that

make

no
sir
we
do
not

and
we
shall
not
need

the
little

journeyed
about
twelve
miles
to
the
fertile
country

a
forest

there
were
the
most
varied
perfumes
in
tropical
profusion
the
almost

were
made
up
of
pomegranates
orange

huge

which
rivalled

in

under
the
perfumed
shade
of

fluttered
a
world
of

amongst
which
the
deserved

worthy

maston
and
the
major
could
not
pass
through
such
opulent
nature
without
admiring
its
splendid
beauty
but
president
barbicane
who
thought
little
of
these
marvels
was
in
a
hurry
to
hasten
onwards
this
country
so
fertile
displeased
him
by
its
very
fertility
without
being
otherwise
hydropical
he
felt
water
under
his
feet
and
sought
in
vain
the
signs
of
incontestable
aridity
in
the
meantime
they
journeyed
on
they
were
obliged
to
ford
several
rivers
and
not
without
danger
for
they
were
infested
with
alligators
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
feet
long
maston
threatened
them
boldly
with
his
formidable
hook
but
he
only
succeeded
in
frightening
the
pelicans
phaetons
and
teals
that
frequented
the
banks
while
the
red
flamingoes
looked
on
with
a
stupid
stare
at
last
these
inhabitants
of
humid
countries
disappeared
in
their
turn
the
trees
became
smaller
and
more
thinly
scattered
in
smaller
woods
some
isolated
groups
stood
amidst
immense
plains
where
ranged
herds
of
startled
deer
at
last
exclaimed
barbicane
rising
in
his
stirrups
here
is
the
region
of
pines
and
savages
answered
the
major
in
fact
a
few
seminoles
appeared
on
the
horizon
they
moved
about
backwards
and
forwards
on
their
fleet
horses
brandishing
long
lances
or
firing
their
guns
with
a
dull
report
however
they
confined
themselves
to
these
hostile
demonstrations
which
had
no
effect
on
barbicane
and
his
companions
they
were
then
in
the
middle
of
a
rocky
plain
a
vast
open
space
of
several
acres
in
extent
which
the
sun
covered
with
burning
rays
it
was
formed
by
a
wide
elevation
of
the
soil
and
seemed
to
offer
to
the
members
of
the
gun
club
all
the
required
conditions
for
the
construction
of
their
columbiad
halt
cried
barbicane
stopping
has
this
place
any
name
it
is

answered
the
floridians
barbicane
without
saying
a
word
dismounted
took
his
instruments
and
began
to
fix
his
position
with
extreme
precision
the
little
troop
drawn
up
around
him
watched
him
in
profound
silence
at
that
moment
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
barbicane
after
an
interval
rapidly
noted
the
result
of
his
observation
and
said
this
place
is
situated
feet
above
the
sea
level
in
lat
and
west
long
by
the
washington
meridian
it
appears
to
me
by
its
barren
and
rocky
nature
to
offer
every
condition
favourable
to
our
enterprise
we
will
therefore
raise
our
magazines
workshops
furnaces
and
workmen
huts
here
and
it
is
from
this
very
spot
said
he
stamping
upon
it
with
his
foot
the
summit
of
stony
hill
that
our
projectile
will
start
for
the

that

evening
barbicane
and
his

returned
to

murchison
the

on
board
the
for
new

he
was
to
engage
an
army
of
workmen
to
bring
back
the
greater
part
of
the
the
members
of
the
gun
club
remained
at
tampa
town
in
order
to
set
on
foot
the
preliminary
work
with
the
assistance
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
eight
days
after
its
departure
the
returned
to
the
bay
with
a
fleet
of
steamboats
murchison
had
succeeded
in
getting
together
workmen
in
the
evil
days
of
slavery
he
would
have
lost
his
time
and
trouble
but
since
america
the
land
of
liberty
has
only
contained
freemen
they
flock
wherever
they
can
get
good
pay
now
money
was
not
wanting
to
the
gun
club
it
offered
a
high
rate
of
wages
with
considerable
and
proportionate
perquisites
the
workman
enlisted
for
florida
could
once
the
work
finished
depend
upon
a
capital
placed
in
his
name
in
the
bank
of
baltimore
murchison
had
therefore
only
to
pick
and
choose
and
could
be
severe
about
the
intelligence
and
skill
of
his
workmen
he
enrolled
in
his
working
legion
the
pick
of
mechanics
stokers
miners
brickmakers
and
artisans
of
every
sort
white
or
black
without
distinction
of
colour
many
of
them
brought
their
families
with
them
it
was
quite
an
emigration
on
the
of
october
at
this
troop
landed
on
the
quays
of
tampa
town
the
movement
and
activity
which
reigned
in
the
little
town
that
had
thus
doubled
its
population
in
a
single
day
may
be
imagined
in
fact
tampa
town
was
enormously
benefited
by
this
enterprise
of
the
gun
club
not
by
the
number
of
workmen
who
were
immediately
drafted
to
stony
hill
but
by
the
influx
of
curious
idlers
who
converged
by
degrees
from
all
points
of
the
globe
towards
the
floridian
peninsula
during
the
first
few
days
they
were
occupied
in
unloading
the
flotilla
of
the
tools
machines
provisions
and
a
large
number
of
plate
iron
houses
made
in
pieces
separately
pieced
and
numbered
at
the
same
time
barbicane
laid
the
first
sleepers
of
a
railway
fifteen
miles
long
that
was
destined
to
unite
stony
hill
and
tampa
town
it
is
known
how
american
railways
are
constructed
with
capricious
bends
bold
slopes
steep
hills
and
deep
valleys
they
do
not
cost
much
and
are
not
much
in
their
way
only
their
trains
run
off
or
jump
off
as
they
please
the
railway
from
tampa
town
to
stony
hill
was
but
a
trifle
and
wanted
neither
much
time
nor
much
money
for
its
construction
barbicane
was
the
soul
of
this
army
of
workmen
who
had
come
at
his
call
he
animated
them
communicated
to
them
his
ardour
enthusiasm
and
conviction
he
was
everywhere
at
once
as
if
endowed
with
the
gift
of
ubiquity
and
always
followed
by
maston
his
bluebottle
fly
his
practical
mind
invented
a
thousand
things
with
him
there
were
no
obstacles
difficulties
or
embarrassment
he
was
as
good
a
miner
mason
and
mechanic
as
he
was
an
artilleryman
having
an
answer
to
every
question
and
a
solution
to
every
problem
he
corresponded
actively
with
the
gun
club
and
the
goldspring
manufactory
and
day
and
night
the
kept
her
steam
up
awaiting
his
orders

on
the
of
november
left
tampa
town
with
a
detachment
of
workmen
and
the
very
next
day
a
small
town
of
workmen
houses
rose
round
stony
hill
they
surrounded
it
with
palisades
and
from
its
movement
and
ardour
it
might
soon
have
been
taken
for
one
of
the
great
cities
of
the
union
life
was
regulated
at
once
and
work
began
in
perfect
order
careful
boring
had
established
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
digging
was
begun
on
november
that
day
barbicane
called
his
foremen
together
and
said
to
them
you
all
know
my
friends
why
i
have
called
you
together
in
this
part
of
florida
we
want
to
cast
a
cannon
nine
feet
in
diameter
six
feet
thick
and
with
a
stone
revetment
nineteen
and
a
half
feet
thick
we
therefore
want
a
well
feet
wide
and
feet
deep
this
large
work
must
be
terminated
in
nine
months
you
have
therefore
cubic
feet
of
soil
to
dig
out
in
days
that
is
to
say
cubic
feet
a
day
that
would
offer
no
difficulty
if
you
had
plenty
of
but
as
you
will
only
have
a
limited
space
it
will
be
more
trouble
nevertheless
as
the
work
must
be
done
it
will
be
done
and
i
depend
upon
your
courage
as
much
as
upon
your
skill
at
the
first
spadeful
was
dug
out
of
the
floridian
soil
and
from
that
moment
this
useful
tool
did
not
stop
idle
a
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
miner
the
gangs
relieved
each
other
every
three
hours
besides
although
the
work
was
colossal
it
did
not
exceed
the
limit
of
human
capability
far
from
that
how
many
works
of
much
greater
difficulty
and
in
which
the
elements
had
to
be
more
directly
contended
against
had
been
brought
to
a
successful
termination
suffice
it
to
mention
the
well
of
father
joseph
made
near
cairo
by
the
sultan
saladin
at
an
epoch
when
machines
had
not
yet
appeared
to
increase
the
strength
of
man
a
hundredfold
and
which
goes
down
to
the
level
of
the
nile
itself
at
a
depth
of
feet
and
that
other
well
dug
at
coblentz
by
the
margrave
jean
of
baden
feet
deep
all
that
was
needed
was
a
triple
depth
and
a
double
width
which
made
the
boring
easier
there
was
not
one
foreman
or
workman
who
doubted
about
the
success
of
the
operation
an
important
decision
taken
by
murchison
and
approved
of
by
barbicane
accelerated
the
work
an
article
in
the
contract
decided
that
the
columbiad
should
be
hooped
with
a
useless
precaution
for
the
cannon
could
evidently
do
without
hoops
this
clause
was
therefore
given
up
hence
a
great
economy
of
time
for
they
could
then
employ
the
new
system
of
boring
now
used
for
digging
wells
by
which
the
masonry
is
done
at
the
same
time
as
the
boring
thanks
to
this
very
simple
operation
they
were
not
obliged
to
prop
up
the
ground
the
wall
kept
it
up
and
went
down
by
its
own
weight
this
manoeuvre
was
only
to
begin
when
the
spade
should
have
reached
the
solid
part
of
the
ground
on
the
of
november
fifty
workmen
began
to
dig
in
the
very
centre
of
the
inclosure
surrounded
by
palisades
that
is
to
say
the
top
of
stony
hill
a
circular
hole
sixty
feet
wide
the
spade
first
turned
up
a
sort
of
black
soil
six
inches
deep
which
it
soon
carried
away
to
this
soil
succeeded
two
feet
of
fine
sand
which
was
carefully
taken
out
as
it
was
to
be
used
for
the
casting
after
this
sand
white
clay
appeared
similar
to
english
chalk
and
which
was
four
feet
thick
then
the
pickaxes
rang
upon
the
hard
layer
a
species
of
rock
formed
by
very
dry
petrified
shells
at
that
point
the
hole
was
six
and
a
half
feet
deep
and
the
masonry
was
begun
at
the
bottom
of
that
excavation
they
made
an
oak
wheel
a
sort
of
circle
strongly
bolted
and
of
enormous
strength
in
its
centre
a
hole
was
pierced
the
size
of
the
exterior
diameter
of
the
columbiad
it
was
upon
this
wheel
that
the
foundations
of
the
masonry
were
placed
the
hydraulic
cement
of
which
joined
the
stones
solidly
together
after
the
workmen
had
bricked
up
the
space
from
the
circumference
to
the
centre
they
found
themselves
inclosed
in
a
well
feet
wide
when
this
work
was
ended
the
miners
began
again
with
spade
and
pickaxe
and
set
upon
the
rock
under
the
wheel
itself
taking
care
to
support
it
on
extremely
strong
tressels
every
time
the
hole
was
two
feet
deeper
they
took
away
the
tressels
the
wheel
gradually
sank
taking
with
it
its
circle
of
masonry
at
the
upper
layer
of
which
the
masons
worked
incessantly
taking
care
to
make
for
the
escape
of
gas
during
the
operation
of
casting
this
kind
of
work
required
great
skill
and
constant
attention
on
the
part
of
the
workmen
more
than
one
digging
under
the
wheel
was
dangerous
and
some
were
even
mortally
wounded
by
the
splinters
of
stone
but
their
energy
did
not
slacken
for
a
moment
by
day
nor
night
by
day
when
the
sun
rays
sent
the
thermometer
up
to
on
the
calcined
planes
by
night
under
the
white
waves
of
electric
light
the
noise
of
the
pickaxe
on
the
rock
the
blasting
and
the
machines
together
with
the
wreaths
of
smoke
scattered
through
the
air
traced
a
circle
of
terror
round
stony
hill
which
the
herds
of
buffaloes
and
the
detachments
of
seminoles
never
dared
to
pass
in
the
meantime
the
work
regularly
advanced
speeded
the
carrying
away
of
the
rubbish
of
unexpected
obstacles
there
were
none
all
the
difficulties
had
been
foreseen
and
guarded
against
when
the
first
month
had
gone
by
the
well
had
attained
the
depth
assigned
for
the
time
feet
in
december
this
depth
was
doubled
and
tripled
in
january
during
february
the
workmen
had
to
contend
against
a
sheet
of
water
which
sprang
from
the
ground
they
were
obliged
to
employ
powerful
pumps
and
apparatus
of
compressed
air
to
drain
it
off
so
as
to
close
up
the
orifice
from
which
it
issued
just
as
leaks
are
caulked
on
board
ship
at
last
they
got
the
better
of
these
unwelcome
springs
only
in
consequence
of
the
loosening
of
the
soil
the
wheel
partially
gave
way
and
there
was
a
landslip
the
frightful
force
of
this
bricked
circle
more
than
feet
high
may
be
imagined
this
accident
cost
the
life
of
several
workmen
three
weeks
had
to
be
taken
up
in
propping
the
stone
revetment
and
making
the
wheel
solid
again
but
thanks
to
the
skill
of
the
engineer
and
the
power
of
the
machines
it
was
all
set
right
and
the
boring
continued
no
fresh
incident
henceforth
stopped
the
progress
of
the
work
and
on
the
of
june
twenty
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
delay
fixed
by
barbicane
the
well
quite
bricked
round
had
reached
the
depth
of
feet
at
the
bottom
the
masonry
rested
upon
a
massive
block
thirty
feet
thick
whilst
at
the
top
it
was
on
a
level
with
the
soil
president
barbicane
and
the
members
of
the
gun
club
warmly
congratulated
the
engineer
murchison
his
cyclopean
work
had
been
accomplished
with
extraordinary
rapidity
during
these
eight
months
barbicane
did
not
leave
stony
hill
for
a
minute
whilst
he
narrowly
watched
over
the
boring
operations
he
took
every
precaution
to
insure
the
health
and
of
his
workmen
and
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
avoid
the
epidemics
common
to
large
agglomerations
of
men
and
so
disastrous
in
those
regions
of
the
globe
exposed
to
tropical
influence
it
is
true
that
several
workmen
paid
with
their
lives
for
the
carelessness
engendered
by
these
dangerous
occupations
but
such
deplorable
misfortunes
can
not
be
avoided
and
these
are
details
that
americans
pay
very
little
attention
to
they
are
more
occupied
with
humanity
in
general
than
with
individuals
in
particular
however
barbicane
professed
the
contrary
principles
and
applied
them
upon
every
occasion
thanks
to
his
care
to
his
intelligence
and
respectful
intervention
in
difficult
cases
to
his
prodigious
and
humane
wisdom
the
average
of
catastrophes
did
not
exceed
that
of
cities
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
amongst
others
those
of
france
where
they
count
about
one
accident
upon
every
francs
of
work
chapter
xv
the
ceremony
of
the
casting
during
the
eight
months
that
were
employed
in
the
operation
of
boring
the
preparatory
works
of
the
casting
had
been
conducted
simultaneously
with
extreme
rapidity
a
stranger
arriving
at
stony
hill
would
have
been
much
surprised
at
what
he
saw
there
six
hundred
yards
from
the
well
and
standing
in
a
circle
round
it
as
a
central
point
were
furnaces
each
six
feet
wide
and
three
yards
apart
the
line
made
by
these
furnaces
was
two
miles
long
they
were
all
built
on
the
same
model
with
high
quadrangular
chimneys
and
had
a
singular
effect
maston
thought
the
architectural
arrangement
superb
it
reminded
him
of
the
monuments
at
washington
he
thought
there
was
nothing
finer
in
the
world
not
even
in
greece
where
he
acknowledged
never
to
have
been
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
their
third
meeting
the
committee
decided
to
use
for
the
columbiad
and
in
particular
the
grey
description
this
metal
is
in
fact
the
most
tenacious
ductile
and
malleable
suitable
for
all
moulding
operations
and
when
smelted
with
pit
coal
it
is
of
superior
quality
for
hydraulic
presses
but
if
it
has
undergone
a
single
fusion
is
rarely
homogeneous
enough
and
it
is
by
means
of
a
second
fusion
that
it
is
purified
refined
and
dispossessed
of
its
last
earthly
deposits
before
being
forwarded
to
tampa
town
the
iron
ore
smelted
in
the
great
furnaces
of
goldspring
and
put
in
contact
with
coal
and
silicium
heated
to
a
high
temperature
was
transformed
into
after
this
first
operation
the
metal
was
taken
to
stony
hill
but
there
were
millions
of
pounds
of
a
bulk
too
expensive
to
be
sent
by
railway
the
price
of
transport
would
have
doubled
that
of
the
raw
material
it
appeared
preferable
to
freight
vessels
at
new
york
and
to
load
them
with
the
iron
in
bars
no
less
than
vessels
of
tons
were
required
quite
a
fleet
which
on
may
left
new
york
took
the
ocean
route
coasted
the
american
shores
entered
the
bahama
channel
doubled
the
point
of
florida
and
on
the
of
the
same
month
entered
the
bay
of
and
anchored
safely
in
the
port
of
tampa
town
there
the
vessels
were
unloaded
and
their
cargo
carried
by
railway
to
stony
hill
and
about
the
middle
of
january
the
enormous
mass
of
metal
was
delivered
at
its
destination
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
furnaces
were
not
too
many
to
melt
these
tons
of
iron
simultaneously
each
of
these
furnaces
contained
about
lbs
of
metal
they
had
been
built
on
the
model
of
those
used
for
the
casting
of
the
rodman
gun
they
were
trapezoidal
in
form
with
a
high
elliptical
arch
the
warming
apparatus
and
the
chimney
were
placed
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
furnace
so
that
it
was
equally
heated
throughout
these
furnaces
built
of
fireproof
brick
were
filled
with
and
a
sole
for
the
bars
of
iron
this
sole
inclosed
at
an
angle
of
allowed
the
metal
to
flow
into
the
from
thence
converging
trenches
carried
it
down
to
the
central
well
the
day
following
that
upon
which
the
works
of
masonry
and
casting
were
terminated
barbicane
set
to
work
upon
the
interior
mould
his
object
now
was
to
raise
in
the
centre
of
the
well
with
a
coincident
axis
a
cylinder
feet
high
and
nine
in
diameter
to
exactly
fill
up
the
space
reserved
for
the
bore
of
the
columbiad
this
cylinder
was
made
of
a
mixture
of
clay
and
sand
with
the
addition
of
hay
and
straw
the
space
left
between
the
mould
and
the
masonry
was
to
be
filled
with
the
molten
metal
which
would
thus
make
the
sides
of
the
cannon
six
feet
thick
this
cylinder
in
order
to
have
its
equilibrium
maintained
had
to
be
consolidated
with
iron
bands
and
fixed
at
intervals
by
means
of
fastened
into
the
stone
lining
after
the
casting
these
clamps
would
be
lost
in
the
block
of
metal
which
would
not
be
the
worse
for
them
this
operation
was
completed
on
the
of
july
and
the
casting
was
fixed
for
the
the
casting
will
be
a
fine
ceremony
said
maston
to
his
friend
barbicane
undoubtedly
answered
barbicane
but
it
will
not
be
a
public
one
what
you
will
not
open
the
doors
of
the
inclosure
to
all
comers
certainly
not
the
casting
of
the
columbiad
is
a
delicate
not
to
say
a
dangerous
operation
and
i
prefer
that
it
should
be
done
with
closed
doors
when
the
projectile
is
discharged
you
may
have
a
public
ceremony
if
you
like
but
till
then
no
the
president
was
right
the
operation
might
be
attended
with
unforeseen
danger
which
a
large
concourse
of
spectators
would
prevent
being
averted
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
complete
freedom
of
movement
no
one
was
admitted
into
the
inclosure
except
a
delegation
of
members
of
the
gun
club
who
made
the
voyage
to
tampa
town
among
them
was
the
brisk
bilsby
tom
hunter
colonel
blomsberry
major
elphinstone
general
morgan
and
to
whom
the
casting
of
the
columbiad
was
a
personal
business
maston
constituted
himself
their
cicerone
he
did
not
excuse
them
any
detail
he
led
them
about
everywhere
through
the
magazines
workshops
amongst
the
machines
and
he
forced
them
to
visit
the
furnaces
one
after
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
visit
they
were
rather
sick
of
it
the
casting
was
to
take
place
precisely
at
twelve
the
evening
before
each
furnace
had
been
charged
with
lbs
of
metal
in
bars
disposed
crossway
to
each
other
so
that
the
warm
air
could
circulate
freely
amongst
them
since
early
morning
the
chimneys
had
been
pouring
forth
volumes
of
flames
into
the
atmosphere
and
the
soil
was
shaken
convulsively
there
were
as
many
pounds
of
coal
to
be
burnt
as
metal
to
be
melted
there
were
therefore
tons
of
coal
throwing
up
before
the
sun
a
thick
curtain
of
black
smoke
the
heat
soon
became
unbearable
in
the
circle
of
furnaces
the
rambling
of
which
resembled
the
rolling
of
thunder
powerful
bellows
added
their
continuous
blasts
and
saturated
the
incandescent
furnaces
with
oxygen
the
operation
of
casting
in
order
to
succeed
must
be
done
rapidly
at
a
signal
given
by
a
each
furnace
was
to
pour
out
the
liquid
iron
and
to
be
entirely
emptied
these
arrangements
made
foremen
and
workmen
awaited
the
preconcerted
moment
with
impatience
mixed
with
emotion
there
was
no
longer
any
one
in
the
inclosure
and
each
superintendent
took
his
place
near
the
aperture
of
the
run
barbicane
and
his
colleagues
installed
on
a
neighbouring
eminence
assisted
at
the
operation
before
them
a
cannon
was
planted
ready
to
be
fired
as
a
sign
from
the
engineer
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
the
first
drops
of
metal
began
to
run
the
reservoirs
were
gradually
filled
and
when
the
iron
was
all
in
a
liquid
state
it
was
left
quiet
for
some
instants
in
order
to
facilitate
the
separation
of
foreign
substances
twelve
struck
the
cannon
was
suddenly
fired
and
shot
its
flame
into
the
air
twelve
hundred
were
opened
simultaneously
and
twelve
hundred
fiery
serpents
crept
along
twelve
hundred
troughs
towards
the
central
well
rolling
in
rings
of
fire
there
they
plunged
with
terrific
noise
down
a
depth
of
feet
it
was
an
exciting
and
magnificent
spectacle
the
ground
trembled
whilst
these
waves
of
iron
throwing
into
the
sky
their
clouds
of
smoke
evaporated
at
the
same
time
the
humidity
of
the
mould
and
hurled
it
upwards
through
the
of
the
masonry
in
the
form
of
impenetrable
vapour
these
artificial
clouds
unrolled
their
thick
spirals
as
they
went
up
to
a
height
of
feet
into
the
air
any
red
indian
wandering
upon
the
limits
of
the
horizon
might
have
believed
in
the
formation
of
a
new
crater
in
the
heart
of
florida
and
yet
it
was
neither
an
irruption
nor

those

the
columbiad
had
the
operation
of
casting
succeeded
people
were
reduced
to
mere
conjecture
however
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
in
its
success
as
the
mould
had
absorbed
the
entire
mass
of
metal
liquefied
in
the
furnaces
still
it
was
necessarily
a
long
time
impossible
to
be
certain
in
fact
when
major
rodman
cast
his
cannon
of
it
took
no
less
than
a
fortnight
to
cool
how
long
therefore
would
the
monstrous
columbiad
crowned
with
its
clouds
of
vapour
and
guarded
by
its
intense
heat
be
kept
from
the
eyes
of
its
admirers
it
was
difficult
to
estimate
the
impatience
of
the
members
of
the
gun
club
was
put
to
a
rude
test
during
this
lapse
of
time
but
it
could
not
be
helped
maston
was
nearly
roasted
through
his
anxiety
a
fortnight
after
the
casting
an
immense
column
of
smoke
was
still
soaring
towards
the
sky
and
the
ground
burnt
the
soles
of
the
feet
within
a
radius
of
feet
round
the
summit
of
stony
hill
the
days
went
by
weeks
followed
them
there
were
no
means
of
cooling
the
immense
cylinder
it
was
impossible
to
approach
it
the
members
of
the
gun
club
were
obliged
to
wait
with
what
patience
they
could
muster
here
we
are
at
the
of
august
said
maston
one
morning
it
wants
hardly
four
months
to
the
of
december
there
still
remains
the
interior
mould
to
be
taken
out
and
the
columbiad
to
be
loaded
we
never
shall
be
ready
one
can
not
even
approach
the
cannon
will
it
never
get
cool
that
would
be
a
cruel
deception
they
tried
to
calm
the
impatient
secretary
without
succeeding
barbicane
said
nothing
but
his
silence
covered
serious
irritation
to
see
himself
stopped
by
an
obstacle
that
time
alone
could
remove
time
an
enemy
to
be
feared
under
the
circumstances
and
to
be
in
the
power
of
an
enemy
was
hard
for
men
of
war
however
daily
observations
showed
a
certain
change
in
the
state
of
the
ground
towards
the
of
august
the
vapour
thrown
off
had
notably
diminished
in
intensity
and
thickness
a
few
days
after
the
earth
only
exhaled
a
slight
puff
of
smoke
the
last
breath
of
the
monster
shut
up
in
its
stone
tomb
by
degrees
the
vibrations
of
the
ground
ceased
and
the
circle
of
heat
contracted
the
most
impatient
of
the
spectators
approached
one
day
they
gained
ten
feet
the
next
twenty
and
on
the
of
august
barbicane
his
colleagues
and
the
engineer
could
take
their
place
on
the
surface
which
covered
the
summit
of
stony
hill
certainly
a
very
healthy
spot
where
it
was
not
yet
allowed
to
have
cold
feet
at
last
cried
the
president
of
the
gun
club
with
an
immense
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
works
were
resumed
the
same
day
the
extraction
of
the
interior
mould
was
immediately
proceeded
with
in
order
to
clear
out
the
bore
pickaxes
spades
and
were
set
to
work
without
intermission
the
clay
and
sand
had
become
exceedingly
hard
under
the
action
of
the
heat
but
by
the
help
of
machines
they
cleared
away
the
mixture
still
burning
at
its
contact
with
the
iron
the
rubbish
was
rapidly
carted
away
on
the
railway
and
the
work
was
done
with
such
spirit
barbicane
intervention
was
so
urgent
and
his
arguments
presented
under
the
form
of
dollars
carried
so
much
conviction
that
on
the
of
september
all
trace
of
the
mould
had
disappeared
the
operation
of
boring
was
immediately
begun
the
were
set
up
without
delay
and
a
few
weeks
later
the
interior
surface
of
the
immense
tube
was
perfectly
cylindrical
and
the
bore
had
acquired
a
high
polish
at
last
on
the
of
september
less
than
a
year
after
the
barbicane
communication
the
enormous
weapon
raised
by
means
of
delicate
instruments
and
quite
vertical
was
ready
for
use
there
was
nothing
but
the
moon
to
wait
for
but
they
were
sure
she
would
not
fail
maston
joy
knew
no
bounds
and
he
nearly
had
a
frightful
fall
whilst
looking
down
the
tube
of
feet
without
colonel
right
arm
which
he
had
happily
preserved
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
like
a
modern
erostatus
would
have
found
a
grave
in
the
depths
of
the
columbiad
the
cannon
was
then
finished
there
was
no
longer
any
possible
doubt
as
to
its
perfect
execution
so
on
the
of
october
captain
nicholl
cleared
off
his
debt
to
president
barbicane
who
inscribed
in
his
a
sum
of
dollars
it
may
be
believed
that
the
captain
anger
reached
its
highest
pitch
and
cost
him
an
illness
still
there
were
yet
three
bets
of
and
dollars
and
if
he
only
gained
his
bargain
would
not
be
a
bad
one
though
not
excellent
but
money
did
not
enter
into
his
calculations
and
the
success
obtained
by
his
rival
in
the
casting
of
a
cannon
against
which
iron
plates
sixty
feet
thick
would
not
have
resisted
was
a
terrible
blow
to
him
since
the
of
september
the
inclosure
on
stony
hill
had
been
quite
open
to
the
public
and
the
concourse
of
visitors
will
be
readily
imagined
in
fact
innumerable
people
from
all
points
of
the
united
states
flocked
to
florida
the
town
of
tampa
was
prodigiously
increased
during
that
year
consecrated
entirely
to
the
works
of
the
gun
club
it
then
comprised
a
population
of
souls
after
having
surrounded
fort
brooke
in
a
network
of
streets
it
was
now
being
lengthened
out
on
that
tongue
of
land
which
separated
the
two
harbours
of
bay
new
quarters
new
squares
and
a
whole
forest
of
houses
had
grown
up
in
these
regions
under
the
heat
of
the
american
sun
companies
were
formed
for
the
erection
of
churches
schools
private
dwellings
and
in
less
than
a
year
the
size
of
the
town
was
increased
tenfold
it
is
well
known
that
yankees
are
born
business
men
everywhere
that
destiny
takes
them
from
the
glacial
to
the
torrid
zone
their
instinct
for
business
is
usefully
exercised
that
is
why
simple
visitors
to
florida
for
the
sole
purpose
of
following
the
operations
of
the
gun
club
allowed
themselves
to
be
involved
in
commercial
operations
as
soon
as
they
were
installed
in
tampa
town
the
vessels
freighted
for
the
transport
of
the
metal
and
the
workmen
had
given
unparalleled
activity
to
the
port
soon
other
vessels
of
every
form
and
tonnage
freighted
with
provisions
and
merchandise
ploughed
the
bay
and
the
two
harbours
vast
offices
of
shipbrokers
and
merchants
were
established
in
the
town
and
the
each
day
published
fresh
arrivals
in
the
port
of
tampa
whilst
roads
were
multiplied
round
the
town
in
consequence
of
the
prodigious
increase
in
its
population
and
commerce
it
was
joined
by
railway
to
the
southern
states
of
the
union
one
line
of
rails
connected
la
mobile
to
pensacola
the
great
southern
maritime
arsenal
thence
from
that
important
point
it
ran
to
tallahassee
there
already
existed
there
a
short
line
miles
long
to
saint
marks
on
the
seashore
it
was
this
that
was
prolonged
as
far
as
tampa
town
awakening
in
its
passage
the
dead
or
sleeping
portions
of
central
florida
thus
tampa
thanks
to
these
marvels
of
industry
due
to
the
idea
born
one
line
day
in
the
brain
of
one
man
could
take
as
its
right
the
airs
of
a
large
town
they
surnamed
it
and
the
capital
of
florida
suffered
an
eclipse
visible
from
all
points
of
the
globe
every
one
will
now
understand
why
the
rivalry
was
so
great
between
texas
and
florida
and
the
irritation
of
the
texicans
when
they
saw
their
pretensions
set
aside
by
the
gun
club
in
their
sagacity
they
had
foreseen
what
a
country
might
gain
from
the
experiment
attempted
by
barbicane
and
the
wealth
that
would
accompany
such
a
texas
lost
a
vast
centre
of
commerce
railways
and
a
considerable
increase
of
population
all
these
advantages
had
been
given
to
that
miserable
floridian
peninsula
thrown
like
a
pier
between
the
waves
of
the
gulf
and
those
of
the
atlantic
ocean
barbicane
therefore
divided
with
general
the
texan
antipathy
however
though
given
up
to
its
commercial
and
industrial
fury
the
new
population
of
tampa
town
took
care
not
to
forget
the
interesting
operations
of
the
gun
club
on
the
contrary
the
least
details
of
the
enterprise
every
blow
of
the
pickaxe
interested
them
there
was
an
incessant
flow
of
people
to
and
from
tampa
town
to
stony
hill
a
perfect
procession
or
better
still
a
pilgrimage
it
was
already
easy
to
foresee
that
the
day
of
the
experiment
the
concourse
of
spectators
would
be
counted
by
millions
for
they
came
already
from
all
points
of
the
earth
to
the
narrow
peninsula
europe
was
emigrating
to
america
but
until
then
it
must
be
acknowledged
the
curiosity
of
the
numerous
arrivals
had
only
been
moderately
satisfied
many
counted
upon
seeing
the
casting
who
only
saw
the
smoke
from
it
this
was
not
much
for
hungry
eyes
but
barbicane
would
allow
no
one
to
see
that
operation
thereupon
ensued
grumbling
discontent
and
murmurs
they
blamed
the
president
for
what
they
considered
dictatorial
conduct
his
act
was
stigmatised
as
there
was
nearly
a
riot
round
stony
hill
but
barbicane
was
not
to
be
moved
when
however
the
columbiad
was
quite
finished
this
state
of
closed
doors
could
no
longer
be
kept
up
besides
it
would
have
been
in
bad
taste
and
even
imprudent
to
offend
public
opinion
barbicane
therefore
opened
the
inclosure
to
all
comers
but
in
accordance
with
his
practical
character
he
determined
to
coin
money
out
of
the
public
curiosity
it
was
indeed
something
to
even
be
allowed
to
see
this
immense
columbiad
but
to
descend
into
its
depths
seemed
to
the
americans
the
plus
of
earthly
felicity
in
consequence
there
was
not
one
visitor
who
was
not
willing
to
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
visiting
the
interior
of
this
metallic
abyss
baskets
hung
from
allowed
them
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
it
became
a
perfect
mania
women
children
and
old
men
all
made
it
their
business
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
colossal
gun
the
price
for
the
descent
was
fixed
at
five
dollars
a
head
and
notwithstanding
this
high
charge
during
the
two
months
that
preceded
the
experiment
the
influx
of
visitors
allowed
the
gun
club
to
pocket
nearly
dollars
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
first
visitors
to
the
columbiad
were
the
members
of
the
gun
club
this
privilege
was
justly
accorded
to
that
illustrious
body
the
ceremony
of
reception
took
place
on
the
of

a

were

long
metal
tube

were
nearly
stifled

how
delightful
how
exquisite
a
table
had
been
laid
for
ten
on
the
massive
stone
which
formed
the
bottom
of
the
columbiad
and
was
lighted
by
a
jet
of
electric
light
as
bright
as
day
itself
numerous
exquisite
dishes
that
seemed
to
descend
from
heaven
were
successively
placed
before
the
guests
and
the
richest
wines
of
france
flowed
profusely
during
this
splendid
repast

the
festival
was

a
telegram
the
great
work
undertaken
by
the
gun
club
was
now
virtually
ended
and
yet
two
months
would
still
elapse
before
the
day
the
projectile
would
start
for
the
moon
these
two
months
would
seem
as
long
as
two
years
to
the
universal
impatience
until
then
the
smallest
details
of
each
operation
had
appeared
in
the
newspapers
every
day
and
were
eagerly
devoured
by
the
public
but
now
it
was
to
be
feared
that
this
interest
dividend
would
be
much
diminished
and
every
one
was
afraid
of
no
longer
receiving
his
daily
share
of
emotions
they
were
all
agreeably
disappointed
the
most
unexpected
extraordinary
incredible
and
improbable
incident
happened
in
time
to
keep
up
the
general
excitement
to
its
highest
pitch
on

at
a
telegram
transmitted
through
the

tore

his

if
this
wonderful
news
instead
of
coming
by

had
simply
arrived
by

and
in
a
sealed
envelope
if
the
french
irish
newfoundland
and
american
telegraph
clerks
had
not
necessarily
been
acquainted
with
it
barbicane
would
not
have
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
would
have
been
quite
silent
about
it
for
prudence
sake
and
in
order
not
to
throw
discredit
on
his
work
this
telegram
might
be
a
practical
joke
especially
as
it
came
from
a
frenchman
what
probability
could
there
be
that
any
man
should
conceive
the
idea
of
such
a
journey
and
if
the
man
did
exist
was
he
not
a
madman
who
would
have
to
be
inclosed
in
a
instead
of
in
a
but
the
message
was
known
and
michel
ardan
proposition
was
already
all
over
the
states
of
the
union
so
barbicane
had
no
reason
for
silence
he
therefore
called
together
his
colleagues
then
in
tampa
town
and
without
showing
what
he
thought
about
it
or
saying
a
word
about
the
degree
of
credibility
the
telegram
deserved
he
read
coldly
the
laconic
text
not
possible
unheard
of
they
are
laughing
at
us
ridiculous
absurd
every
sort
of
expression
for
doubt
incredulity
and
folly
was
heard
for
some
minutes
with
accompaniment
of
appropriate
gestures
maston
alone
uttered
the
words
that
an
idea
he
exclaimed
yes
answered
the
major
but
if
people
have
such
ideas
as
that
they
ought
not
to
think
of
putting
them
into
execution
why
not
quickly
answered
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
ready
for
an
argument
but
the
subject
was
let
drop
in
the
meantime
michel
ardan
name
was
already
going
about
tampa
town
strangers
and
natives
talked
and
joked
together
not
about
the
european
evidently
a
mythical
personage
but
about
maston
who
had
the
folly
to
believe
in
his
existence
when
barbicane
proposed
to
send
a
projectile
to
the
moon
every
one
thought
the
enterprise
natural
and
practicable
a
simple
affair
of
ballistics
but
that
a
reasonable
being
should
offer
to
go
the
journey
inside
the
projectile
was
a
farce
or
to
use
a
familiar
americanism
it
was
all
humbug
this
laughter
lasted
till
evening
throughout
the
union
an
unusual
thing
in
a
country
where
any
impossible
enterprise
finds
adepts
and
partisans
still
michel
ardan
proposition
did
not
fail
to
awaken
a
certain
emotion
in
many
minds
they
had
not
thought
of
such
a
thing
how
many
things
denied
one
day
had
become
realities
the
next
why
should
not
this
journey
be
accomplished
one
day
or
another
but
any
way
the
man
who
would
run
such
a
risk
must
be
a
madman
and
certainly
as
his
project
could
not
be
taken
seriously
he
would
have
done
better
to
be
quiet
about
it
instead
of
troubling
a
whole
population
with
such
ridiculous
trash
but
first
of
all
did
this
personage
really
exist
that
was
the
great
question
the
name
of
michel
ardan
was
not
altogether
unknown
in
america
it
belonged
to
a
european
much
talked
about
for
his
audacious
enterprises
then
the
telegram
sent
all
across
the
depths
of
the
atlantic
the
designation
of
the
ship
upon
which
the
frenchman
had
declared
he
had
taken
his
passage
the
date
assigned
for
his
arrival
all
these
circumstances
gave
to
the
proposition
a
certain
air
of
probability
they
were
obliged
to
disburden
their
minds
about
it
soon
these
isolated
individuals
formed
into
groups
the
groups
became
condensed
under
the
action
of
curiosity
like
atoms
by
virtue
of
molecular
attraction
and
the
result
was
a
compact
crowd
going
towards
president
barbicane
dwelling
the
president
since
the
arrival
of
the
message
had
not
said
what
he
thought
about
it
he
had
let
maston
express
his
opinions
without
manifesting
either
approbation
or
blame
he
kept
quiet
proposing
to
await
events
but
he
had
not
taken
public
impatience
into
consideration
and
was
not
very
pleased
at
the
sight
of
the
population
of
tampa
town
assembled
under
his
windows
murmurs
cries
and
vociferations
soon
forced
him
to
appear
it
will
be
seen
that
he
had
all
the
disagreeables
as
well
as
the
duties
of
a
public
man
he
therefore
appeared
silence
was
made
and
a
citizen
asked
him
the
following
question
is
the
person
designated
in
the
telegram
as
michel
ardan
on
his
way
to
america
or
not
gentlemen
answered
barbicane
i
know
no
more
than
you
we
must
get
to
know
exclaimed
some
impatient
voices
time
will
inform
us
answered
the
president
coldly
time
has
no
right
to
keep
a
whole
country
in
suspense
answered
the
orator
have
you
altered
your
plans
for
the
projectile
as
the
telegram
demanded
not
yet
gentlemen
but
you
are
right
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
telegraph
that
has
caused
all
this
emotion
to
the
cried
the
crowd
barbicane
descended
into
the
street
and
heading
the
immense
assemblage
he
went
towards
the
a
few
minutes
afterwards
a
telegram
was
on
its
way
to
the
underwriters
at
liverpool
asking
for
an
answer
to
the
following
questions
what
sort
of
vessel
is
the
when
did
she
leave
europe
had
she
a
frenchman
named
michel
ardan
on
board
two
hours
afterwards
barbicane
received
such
precise
information
that
doubt
was
no
longer
possible
the
steamer
from
liverpool
set
sail
on
october
for
tampa
town
having
on
board
a
frenchman
inscribed
in
the
book
as
michel
ardan
at
this
confirmation
of
the
first
telegram
the
eyes
of
the
president
were
lighted
up
with
a
sudden
flame
he
clenched
his
hands
and
was
heard
to
mutter
it
is
true
then
it
is
possible
then
the
frenchman
does
exist
and
in
a
fortnight
he
will
be
here
but
he
is
a
madman
i
never
can
consent
and
yet
the
very
same
evening
he
wrote
to
the
firm
of
breadwill
and
begging
them
to
suspend
the
casting
of
the
projectile
until
fresh
orders
now
how
can
the
emotion
be
described
which
took
possession
of
the
whole
of
america
the
effect
of
the
barbicane
proposition
was
surpassed
tenfold
what
the
newspapers
of
the
union
said
the
way
they
accepted
the
news
and
how
they
chanted
the
arrival
of
this
hero
from
the
old
continent
how
to
depict
the
feverish
agitation
in
which
every
one
lived
counting
the
hours
minutes
and
seconds
how
to
give
even
a
feeble
idea
of
the
effect
of
one
idea
upon
so
many
heads
how
to
show
every
occupation
being
given
up
for
a
single
preoccupation
work
stopped
commerce
suspended
vessels
ready
to
start
waiting
in
the
ports
so
as
not
to
miss
the
arrival
of
the
every
species
of
conveyance
arriving
full
and
returning
empty
the
bay
of
incessantly
ploughed
by
steamers
and
of
all
dimensions
how
to
denominate
in
numbers
the
thousands
of
curious
people
who
in
a
fortnight
increased
the
population
of
tampa
town
fourfold
and
were
obliged
to
encamp
under
tents
like
an
army
in
campaign
all
this
is
a
task
above
human
force
and
could
not
be
undertaken
without
rashness
at
on
the
of
october
the
semaphores
of
the
bahama
channel
signalled
thick
smoke
on
the
horizon
two
hours
later
a
large
steamer
exchanged
signals
with
them
the
name
was
immediately
sent
to
tampa
town
at
the
english
vessel
entered
the
bay
of
at
she
passed
the
entrance
to
hillisboro
harbour
and
at
weighed
anchor
in
the
port
of
tampa
town
the
anchor
had
not
reached
its
sandy
bed
before
vessels
surrounded
the
and
the
steamer
was
taken
by
assault
barbicane
was
the
first
on
deck
and
in
a
voice
the
emotion
of
which
he
tried
in
vain
to
suppress
michel
ardan
he
exclaimed
present
answered
an
individual
mounted
on
the
poop
barbicane
with
his
arms
crossed
questioning
eyes
and
silent
mouth
looked
fixedly
at
the
passenger
of
the
he
was
a
man
years
of
age
tall
but
already
rather
stooping
like
caryatides
which
support
balconies
on
their
shoulders
his
large
head
shook
every
now
and
then
a
shock
of
red
hair
like
a
lion
mane
a
short
face
wide
forehead
a
moustache
bristling
like
a
cat
whiskers
and
little
bunches
of
yellow
hair
on
the
middle
of
his
cheeks
round
and
rather
eyes
completed
this
eminently
feline
physiognomy
but
the
nose
was
boldly
cut
the
mouth
particularly
humane
the
forehead
high
intelligent
and
ploughed
like
a
field
that
was
never
allowed
to
remain
fallow
lastly
a
muscular
body
well
poised
on
long
limbs
muscular
arms
powerful
and
levers
and
a
decided
gait
made
a
solidly
built
fellow
of
this
european
rather
wrought
than
cast
to
borrow
one
of
his
expressions
from
metallurgic
art
the
disciples
of
lavater
or
gratiolet
would
have
easily
deciphered
in
the
cranium
and
physiognomy
of
this
personage
indisputable
signs
of
combativity
that
is
to
say
of
courage
in
danger
and
tendency
to
overcome
obstacles
those
of
benevolence
and
a
belief
in
the
marvellous
an
instinct
that
makes
many
natures
dwell
much
on
superhuman
things
but
on
the
other
hand
the
bumps
of
acquisivity
the
need
of
possessing
and
acquiring
were
absolutely
wanting
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
physical
type
of
the
passenger
of
the
his
garments
wide
loose
and
flowing
open
cravat
wide
collar
and
cuffs
always
unbuttoned
through
which
came
nervous
hands
people
felt
that
even
in
the
midst
of
winter
and
dangers
that
man
was
never
cold
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
amongst
the
crowd
he
bustled
about
never
still
for
a
moment
dragging
his
anchors
in
nautical
speech
gesticulating
making
friends
with
everybody
and
biting
his
nails
nervously
he
was
one
of
those
original
beings
whom
the
creator
invents
in
a
moment
of
fantasy
and
of
whom
he
immediately
breaks
the
cast
in
fact
the
character
of
michel
ardan
offered
a
large
field
for
physiological
analysis
this
astonishing
man
lived
in
a
perpetual
disposition
to
hyperbole
and
had
not
yet
passed
the
age
of
superlatives
objects
depicted
themselves
on
the
retina
of
his
eye
with
exaggerated
dimensions
from
thence
an
association
of
gigantic
ideas
he
saw
everything
on
a
large
scale
except
difficulties
and
men
he
was
besides
of
a
luxuriant
nature
an
artist
by
instinct
and
witty
fellow
he
loved
arguments
and
defended
the
weak
side
tooth
and
nail
amongst
other
peculiarities
he
gave
himself
out
as
sublimely
ignorant
like
shakspeare
and
professed
supreme
contempt
for
all
people
said
he
who
only
score
our
points
he
was
in
short
a
bohemian
of
the
country
of
brains
adventurous
but
not
an
adventurer
a
harebrained
fellow
a
phaeton
running
away
with
the
horses
of
the
sun
a
kind
of
icarus
with
relays
of
wings
he
had
a
wonderful
facility
for
getting
into
scrapes
and
an
equally
wonderful
facility
for
getting
out
of
them
again
falling
on
his
feet
like
a
cat
in
short
his
motto
was
whatever
it
may
cost
and
the
love
of
the
impossible
his
ruling
passion
according
to
pope
fine
expression
but
this
enterprising
fellow
had
the
defects
of
his
qualities
who
risks
nothing
wins
nothing
it
is
said
ardan
often
risked
much
and
got
nothing
he
was
perfectly
disinterested
and
chivalric
he
would
not
have
signed
the
of
his
worst
enemy
and
would
have
sold
himself
into
slavery
to
redeem
a
negro
in
france
and
europe
everybody
knew
this
brilliant
bustling
person
did
he
not
get
talked
of
ceaselessly
by
the
hundred
voices
of
fame
hoarse
in
his
service
did
he
not
live
in
a
glass
house
taking
the
entire
universe
as
confidant
of
his
most
intimate
secrets
but
he
also
possessed
an
admirable
collection
of
enemies
amongst
those
he
had
cuffed
and
wounded
whilst
using
his
elbows
to
make
a
passage
in
the
crowd
still
he
was
generally
liked
and
treated
like
a
spoiled
child
every
one
was
interested
in
his
bold
enterprises
and
followed
them
with
uneasy
mind
he
was
known
to
be
so
imprudent
when
some
friend
wished
to
stop
him
by
predicting
an
approaching
catastrophe
the
forest
is
only
burnt
by
its
own
trees
he
answered
with
an
amiable
smile
not
knowing
that
he
was
quoting
the
prettiest
of
arabian
proverbs
such
was
the
passenger
of
the
always
in
a
bustle
always
boiling
under
the
action
of
inward
fire
always
moved
not
by
what
he
had
come
to
do
in
america
he
did
not
even
think
about
it
but
on
account
of
his
feverish
organisation
if
ever
individuals
offered
a
striking
contrast
they
were
the
frenchman
michel
ardan
and
the
yankee
barbicane
both
however
enterprising
bold
and
audacious
each
in
his
own
way
barbicane
contemplation
of
his
rival
was
quickly
interrupted
by
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
these
cries
became
even
so
frantic
and
the
enthusiasm
took
such
a
personal
form
that
michel
ardan
after
having
shaken
a
thousand
hands
in
which
he
nearly
left
his
ten
fingers
was
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
his
cabin
barbicane
followed
him
without
having
uttered
a
word
you
are
barbicane
michel
ardan
asked
him
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
and
in
the
same
tone
as
he
would
have
spoken
to
a
friend
of
twenty
years
standing
yes
answered
the
president
of
the
gun
club
well
good
morning
barbicane
how
are
you
very
well
that
right
that
right
then
said
barbicane
without
further
preliminary
you
have
decided
to
go
quite
decided
nothing
will
stop
you
nothing
have
you
altered
your
projectile
as
i
told
you
in
my
message
i
waited
till
you
came
but
asked
barbicane
insisting
once
more
you
have
quite
reflected
reflected
have
i
any
time
to
lose
i
find
the
occasion
to
go
for
a
trip
to
the
moon
i
profit
by
it
and
that
is
all
it
seems
to
me
that
does
not
want
so
much
reflection
barbicane
looked
eagerly
at
the
man
who
spoke
of
his
project
of
journey
with
so
much
carelessness
and
with
such
absence
of
anxiety
but
at
least
he
said
you
have
some
plan
some
means
of
execution
excellent
means
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
one
thing
i
like
to
say
my
say
once
and
for
all
and
to
everybody
and
to
hear
no
more
about
it
then
unless
you
can
think
of
something
better
call
together
your
friends
your
colleagues
all
the
town
all
florida
all
america
if
you
like
and
i
shall
be
ready
to
state
my
means
of
execution
and
answer
any
objections
whatever
they
may
be
will
that
do
yes
that
will
do
answered
barbicane
whereupon
the
president
left
the
cabin
and
told
the
crowd
about
michel
ardan
proposition
his
words
were
received
with
great
demonstrations
of
joy
that
cut
short
all
difficulties
the
next
day
every
one
could
contemplate
the
european
hero
at
their
ease
still
some
of
the
most
obstinate
spectators
would
not
leave
the
deck
of
the
they
passed
the
night
on
board
amongst
others
maston
had
screwed
his
steel
hook
into
the
combing
of
the
poop
and
it
would
have
taken
the
capstan
to
get
it
out
again
he
is
a
hero
a
hero
cried
he
in
every
tone
and
we
are
only
old
women
compared
to
that
european
as
to
the
president
after
having
requested
the
spectators
to
withdraw
he
the
passenger
cabin
and
did
not
leave
it
till
the
bell
of
the
steamer
rang
out
the
midnight
quarter
but
then
the
two
rivals
in
popularity
shook
each
other
warmly
by
the
hand
and
separated
friends
chapter
xix
a
meeting
the
next
day
the
sun
did
not
rise
early
enough
to
satisfy
public
impatience
barbicane
fearing
that
indiscreet
questions
would
be
put
to
michel
ardan
would
like
to
have
reduced
his
auditors
to
a
small
number
of
adepts
to
his
colleagues
for
instance
but
it
was
as
easy
as
to
dam
up
the
falls
at
niagara
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
renounce
his
project
and
let
his
friend
run
all
the
risks
of
a
public
lecture
the
new
town
hall
of
tampa
town
notwithstanding
its
colossal
dimensions
was
considered
insufficient
for
the
occasion
which
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
public
meeting
the
place
chosen
was
a
vast
plain
situated
outside
the
town
in
a
few
hours
they
succeeded
in
sheltering
it
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
ships
of
the
port
rich
in
canvas
furnished
the
necessary
accessories
for
a
colossal
tent
soon
an
immense
sky
of
cloth
was
spread
over
the
calcined
plain
and
defended
it
against
the
heat
of
the
day
there
persons
stood
and
braved
a
stifling
temperature
for
several
hours
whilst
awaiting
the
frenchman
arrival
of
that
crowd
of
spectators
alone
could
see
and
hear
a
second
third
saw
badly
and
did
not
hear
as
to
the
remaining
third
it
neither
heard
nor
saw
though
it
was
not
the
least
eager
to
applaud
at
three
michel
ardan
made
his
appearance
accompanied
by
the
principal
members
of
the
gun
club
he
gave
his
right
arm
to
president
barbicane
and
his
left
to
maston
more
radiant
than
the
midday
sun
and
nearly
as
ruddy
ardan
mounted
the
platform
from
which
his
eyes
extended
over
a
forest
of
black
hats
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
embarrassed
he
did
not
pose
he
was
at
home
there
gay
familiar
and
amiable
to
the
cheers
that
greeted
him
he
answered
by
a
gracious
bow
then
with
his
hand
asked
for
silence
began
to
speak
in
english
and
expressed
himself
very
correctly
in
these
terms
gentlemen
said
he
although
it
is
very
warm
i
intend
to
keep
you
a
few
minutes
to
give
you
some
explanation
of
the
projects
which
have
appeared
to
interest
you
i
am
neither
an
orator
nor
a
and
i
did
not
count
upon
having
to
speak
in
public
but
my
friend
barbicane
tells
me
it
would
give
you
pleasure
so
i
do
it
then
listen
to
me
with
your
ears
and
please
to
excuse
the
faults
of
the
orator
this
unceremonious
beginning
was
much
admired
by
the
audience
who
expressed
their
satisfaction
by
an
immense
murmur
of
applause
gentlemen
said
he
no
mark
of
approbation
or
dissent
is
prohibited
that
settled
i
continue
and
first
of
all
do
not
forget
that
you
have
to
do
with
an
ignorant
man
but
his
ignorance
goes
far
enough
to
ignore
difficulties
it
has
therefore
appeared
a
simple
natural
and
easy
thing
to
him
to
take
his
passage
in
a
projectile
and
to
start
for
the
moon
that
journey
would
be
made
sooner
or
later
and
as
to
the
mode
of
locomotion
adopted
it
simply
follows
the
law
of
progress
man
began
by
travelling
on
all
fours
then
one
fine
day
he
went
on
two
feet
then
in
a
cart
then
in
a
coach
then
on
a
railway
well
the
projectile
is
the
carriage
of
the
future
and
to
speak
the
truth
planets
are
only
projectiles
simple
hurled
by
the
hand
of
the
creator
but
to
return
to
our
vehicle
some
of
you
gentlemen
may
think
that
the
speed
it
will
travel
at
is
excessive
nothing
of
the
kind
all
the
planets
go
faster
and
the
earth
itself
in
its
movement
round
the
sun
carries
us
along
three
times
as
fast
here
are
some
examples
only
i
ask
your
permission
to
express
myself
in
leagues
for
american
measures
are
not
very
familiar
to
me
and
i
fear
getting
muddled
in
my
calculations
the
demand
appeared
quite
simple
and
offered
no
difficulty
the
orator
resumed
his
speech
the
following
gentlemen
is
the
speed
of
the
different
planets
i
am
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
notwithstanding
my
ignorance
i
know
this
small
astronomical
detail
exactly
but
in
two
minutes
you
will
be
as
learned
as
i
learn
then
that
neptune
goes
at
the
rate
of
leagues
an
hour
uranus
saturn
jupiter
mars
the
earth
venus
mercury
some
comets
leagues
in
their
perihelion
as
to
us
veritable
idlers
people
in
no
hurry
our
speed
does
not
exceed
leagues
and
it
will
go
on
decreasing
i
ask
you
if
there
is
anything
to
wonder
at
and
if
it
is
not
evident
that
it
will
be
surpassed
some
day
by
still
greater
speeds
of
which
light
or
electricity
will
probably
be
the
mechanical
agents
no
one
seemed
to
doubt
this
affirmation
dear
hearers
he
resumed
according
to
certain
narrow
minds
that
is
the
best
qualification
for
them
humanity
is
inclosed
in
a
popilius
circle
which
it
can
not
break
open
and
is
condemned
to
vegetate
upon
this
globe
without
ever
flying
towards
the
planetary
shores
nothing
of
the
kind
we
are
going
to
the
moon
we
shall
go
to
the
planets
we
shall
go
to
the
stars
as
we
now
go
from
liverpool
to
new
york
easily
rapidly
surely
and
the
atmospheric
ocean
will
be
as
soon
crossed
as
the
oceans
of
the
earth
distance
is
only
a
relative
term
and
will
end
by
being
reduced
to
zero
the
assembly
though
greatly
in
favour
of
the
french
hero
was
rather
staggered
by
this
audacious
theory
michel
ardan
appeared
to
see
it
you
do
not
seem
convinced
my
worthy
hosts
he
continued
with
an
amiable
smile
well
let
us
reason
a
little
do
you
know
how
long
it
would
take
an
express
train
to
reach
the
moon
three
hundred
days
not
more
a
journey
of
leagues
but
what
is
that
not
even
nine
times
round
the
earth
and
there
are
very
few
sailors
who
have
not
done
that
during
their
existence
think
i
shall
be
only
hours
on
the
road
ah
you
imagine
that
the
moon
is
a
long
way
from
the
earth
and
that
one
must
think
twice
before
attempting
the
adventure
but
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
going
to
neptune
which
gravitates
at
leagues
from
the
sun
that
is
a
journey
that
very
few
people
could
go
even
if
it
only
cost
a
farthing
a
mile
even
baron
rothschild
would
not
have
enough
to
take
his
ticket
this
argument
seemed
greatly
to
please
the
assembly
besides
michel
ardan
full
of
his
subject
grew
superbly
eloquent
he
felt
he
was
listened
to
and
resumed
with
admirable
assurance
well
my
friends
this
distance
from
neptune
to
the
sun
is
nothing
compared
to
that
of
the
stars
some
of
which
are
billions
of
leagues
from
the
sun
and
yet
people
speak
of
the
distance
that
separates
the
planets
from
the
sun
do
you
know
what
i
think
of
this
universe
that
begins
with
the
sun
and
ends
at
neptune
should
you
like
to
know
my
theory
it
is
a
very
simple
one
according
to
my
opinion
the
solar
universe
is
one
solid
homogeneous
mass
the
planets
that
compose
it
are
close
together
crowd
one
another
and
the
space
between
them
is
only
the
space
that
separates
the
molecules
of
the
most
compact
metal
silver
iron
or
platinum
i
have
therefore
the
right
to
affirm
and
i
will
repeat
it
with
a
conviction
you
will
all
share
distance
is
a
vain
word
distance
does
not
exist
well
said
bravo
hurrah
cried
the
assembly
with
one
voice
electrified
by
the
gesture
and
accent
of
the
orator
and
the
boldness
of
his
conceptions
no
cried
maston
more
energetically
than
the
others
distance
does
not
exist
and
carried
away
by
the
violence
of
his
movements
and
emotions
he
could
hardly
contain
he
nearly
fell
from
the
top
of
the
platform
to
the
ground
but
he
succeeded
in
recovering
his
equilibrium
and
thus
avoided
a
fall
that
would
have
brutally
proved
distance
not
to
be
a
vain
word
then
the
speech
of
the
distinguished
orator
resumed
its
course
my
friends
said
he
i
think
that
this
question
is
now
solved
if
i
have
not
convinced
you
all
it
is
because
i
have
been
timid
in
my
demonstrations
feeble
in
my
arguments
and
you
must
set
it
down
to
my
theoretic
ignorance
however
that
may
be
i
repeat
the
distance
from
the
earth
to
her
satellite
is
really
very
unimportant
and
unworthy
to
occupy
a
serious
mind
i
do
not
think
i
am
advancing
too
much
in
saying
that
soon
a
service
of
trains
will
be
established
by
projectiles
in
which
the
journey
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
will
be
comfortably
accomplished
there
will
be
no
shocks
nor
running
off
the
lines
to
fear
and
the
goal
will
be
reached
rapidly
without
fatigue
in
a
straight
line
the
crow
flies
before
twenty
years
are
over
half
the
earth
will
have
visited
the
moon
three
cheers
for
michel
ardan
cried
the
assistants
even
those
least
convinced
three
cheers
for
barbicane
modestly
answered
the
orator
this
act
of
gratitude
towards
the
promoter
of
the
enterprise
was
greeted
with
unanimous
applause
now
my
friends
resumed
michel
ardan
if
you
have
any
questions
to
ask
me
you
will
evidently
embarrass
me
but
still
i
will
endeavour
to
answer
you
until
now
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
reason
to
be
very
satisfied
with
the
discussion
it
had
rolled
upon
speculative
theories
upon
which
michel
ardan
carried
away
by
his
lively
imagination
had
shown
himself
very
brilliant
he
must
therefore
be
prevented
from
deviating
towards
practical
questions
which
he
would
doubtless
not
come
out
of
so
well
barbicane
made
haste
to
speak
and
asked
his
new
friend
if
he
thought
that
the
moon
or
the
planets
were
inhabited
that
is
a
great
problem
my
worthy
president
answered
the
orator
smiling
still
if
i
am
not
mistaken
men
of
great
intelligence
plutarch
swedenborg
bernardin
de
and
many
others
answered
in
the
affirmative
if
i
answered
from
a
natural
philosophy
point
of
view
i
should
do
the
same
i
should
say
to
myself
that
nothing
useless
exists
in
this
world
and
answering
your
question
by
another
friend
barbicane
i
should
affirm
that
if
the
planets
are
inhabitable
either
they
are
inhabited
they
have
been
or
they
will
be
very
well
cried
the
first
ranks
of
spectators
whose
opinion
had
the
force
of
law
for
the
others
it
is
impossible
to
answer
with
more
logic
and
justice
said
the
president
of
the
gun
club
the
question
therefore
comes
to
this
the
planets
inhabitable
i
think
so
for
my
part
and
i
i
am
certain
of
it
answered
michel
ardan
still
replied
one
of
the
assistants
there
are
arguments
against
the
inhabitability
of
the
worlds
in
most
of
them
it
is
evident
that
the
principles
of
life
must
be
modified
thus
only
to
speak
of
the
planets
the
people
must
be
burnt
up
in
some
and
frozen
in
others
according
as
they
are
a
long
or
short
distance
from
the
sun
i
regret
answered
michel
ardan
not
to
know
my
honourable
opponent
personally
his
objection
has
its
value
but
i
think
it
may
be
combated
with
some
success
like
all
those
of
which
the
habitability
of
worlds
has
been
the
object
if
i
were
a
physician
i
should
say
that
if
there
were
less
caloric
put
in
motion
in
the
planets
nearest
to
the
sun
and
more
on
the
contrary
in
the
distant
planets
this
simple
phenomenon
would
suffice
to
equalise
the
heat
and
render
the
temperature
of
these
worlds
bearable
to
beings
organised
like
we
are
if
i
were
a
naturalist
i
should
tell
him
after
many
illustrious
that
nature
furnishes
us
on
earth
with
examples
of
animals
living
in
very
different
conditions
of
habitability
that
fish
breathe
in
a
medium
mortal
to
the
other
animals
that
amphibians
have
a
double
existence
difficult
to
explain
that
certain
inhabitants
of
the
sea
live
in
the
greatest
depths
and
support
there
without
being
crushed
pressures
of
fifty
or
sixty
atmospheres
that
some
aquatic
insects
insensible
to
the
temperature
are
met
with
at
the
same
time
in
springs
of
boiling
water
and
in
the
frozen
plains
of
the
polar
ocean
in
short
there
are
in
nature
many
means
of
action
often
incomprehensible
but
no
less
real
if
i
were
a
chemist
i
should
say
that
a√´rolites
bodies
evidently
formed
away
from
our
terrestrial
globe
have
when
analysed
revealed
indisputable
traces
of
carbon
a
substance
that
owes
its
origin
solely
to
organised
beings
and
which
according
to
reichenbach
experiments
must
necessarily
have
been
lastly
if
i
were
a
theologian
i
should
say
that
divine
redemption
according
to
paul
seems
applicable
not
only
to
the
earth
but
to
all
the
celestial
bodies
but
i
am
neither
a
theologian
chemist
naturalist
nor
natural
philosopher
so
in
my
perfect
ignorance
of
the
great
laws
that
rule
the
universe
i
can
only
answer
do
not
know
if
the
heavenly
bodies
are
inhabited
and
as
i
do
not
know
i
am
going
to
see
did
the
adversary
of
michel
ardan
theories
hazard
any
further
arguments
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
the
frantic
cries
of
the
crowd
would
have
prevented
any
opinion
from
being
promulgated
when
silence
was
again
restored
even
in
the
most
distant
groups
the
triumphant
orator
contented
himself
with
adding
the
following
considerations
you
will
think
gentlemen
that
i
have
hardly
touched
upon
this
grave
question
i
am
not
here
to
give
you
an
instructive
lecture
upon
this
vast
subject
there
is
another
series
of
arguments
in
favour
of
the
heavenly
bodies
being
inhabited
i
do
not
look
upon
that
allow
me
only
to
insist
upon
one
point
to
the
people
who
maintain
that
the
planets
are
not
inhabited
you
must
answer
may
be
right
if
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
earth
is
the
best
of
possible
worlds
but
it
is
not
so
notwithstanding
voltaire
it
has
only
one
satellite
whilst
jupiter
uranus
saturn
and
neptune
have
several
at
their
service
an
advantage
that
is
not
to
be
disdained
but
that
which
now
renders
the
earth
an
uncomfortable
place
of
abode
is
the
inclination
of
its
axis
upon
its
orbit
hence
the
inequality
of
day
and
night
hence
the
unfortunate
diversity
of
seasons
upon
our
miserable
spheroid
it
is
always
either
too
warm
or
too
cold
we
are
frozen
in
winter
and
roasted
in
summer
it
is
the
planet
of
colds
rheumatism
and
consumption
whilst
on
the
surface
of
jupiter
for
instance
where
the
axis
has
only
a
very
slight
inclination
the
inhabitants
can
enjoy
invariable
temperature
there
is
the
perpetual
spring
summer
autumn
and
winter
zone
each
may
choose
the
climate
that
suits
him
and
may
shelter
himself
all
his
life
from
the
variations
of
the
temperature
you
will
doubtless
agree
to
this
superiority
of
jupiter
over
our
planet
without
speaking
of
its
years
which
each
lasts
twelve
years
what
is
more
it
is
evident
to
me
that
under
these
auspices
and
under
such
marvellous
conditions
of
existence
the
inhabitants
of
that
fortunate
world
are
superior
beings
that
are
more
learned
artists
more
artistic
the
wicked
less
wicked
and
the
good
are
better
alas
what
is
wanting
to
our
spheroid
to
reach
this
perfection
is
very
little
an
axis
of
rotation
less
inclined
on
the
plane
of
its
orbit
well
cried
an
impetuous
voice
let
us
unite
our
efforts
invent
machines
and
rectify
the
earth
axis
thunders
of
applause
greeted
this
proposition
the
author
of
which
could
be
no
other
than
maston
it
is
probable
that
the
fiery
secretary
had
been
carried
away
by
his
instincts
as
engineer
to
venture
such
a
proposition
but
it
must
be
said
for
it
is
the
truth
many
encouraged
him
with
their
cries
and
doubtless
if
they
had
found
the
demanded
by
archimedes
the
americans
would
have
constructed
a
lever
capable
of
raising
the
world
and
redressing
its
axis
but
this
point
was
wanting
to
these
bold
mechanicians
nevertheless
this
eminently
practical
idea
had
enormous
success
the
discussion
was
suspended
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
and
long
very
long
afterwards
they
talked
in
the
united
states
of
america
of
the
proposition
so
energetically
enunciated
by
the
perpetual
secretary
of
the
gun
club
chapter
xx
thrust
and
parry
this
incident
seemed
to
have
terminated
the
discussion
but
when
the
agitation
had
subsided
these
words
were
heard
uttered
in
a
loud
and
severe
voice
now
that
the
orator
has
allowed
his
fancy
to
roam
perhaps
he
would
kindly
go
back
to
his
subject
pay
less
attention
to
theories
and
discuss
the
practical
part
of
his
expedition
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
person
who
spoke
thus
he
was
a
thin
man
with
an
energetic
face
and
an
american
beard
by
taking
advantage
of
the
agitation
in
the
assembly
from
time
to
time
he
had
gained
by
degrees
the
front
row
of
spectators
there
with
his
arms
crossed
his
eyes
brilliant
and
bold
he
stared
imperturbably
at
the
hero
of
the
meeting
after
having
asked
his
question
he
kept
silence
and
did
not
seem
disturbed
by
the
thousands
of
eyes
directed
towards
him
nor
by
the
disapproving
murmur
excited
by
his
words
the
answer
being
delayed
he
again
put
the
question
with
the
same
clear
and
precise
accent
then
he
added
we
are
here
to
discuss
the
moon
not
the
earth
you
are
right
sir
answered
michel
ardan
the
discussion
has
wandered
from
the
point
we
will
return
to
the
moon
sir
resumed
the
unknown
man
you
pretend
that
our
satellite
is
inhabited
so
far
so
good
but
if
selenites
do
exist
they
certainly
live
without
breathing
for
i
tell
you
the
fact
for
your
good
there
is
not
the
least
particle
of
air
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
at
this
affirmation
ardan
shook
his
red
mane
he
understood
that
a
struggle
was
coming
with
this
man
on
the
real
question
he
looked
at
him
fixedly
in
his
turn
and
said
ah
there
is
no
air
in
the
moon
and
who
says
so
pray
the
indeed
indeed
sir
resumed
michel
joking
apart
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
who
know
but
a
profound
contempt
for
who
do
not
know
do
you
know
any
who
belong
to
the
latter
category
yes
in
france
there
is
one
who
maintains
that
a
bird
can
not
fly
and
another
who
demonstrates
that
a
fish
is
not
made
to
live
in
water
there
is
no
question
of
those
two
sir
and
i
can
quote
in
support
of
my
proposition
names
that
you
will
not
object
to
then
sir
you
would
greatly
embarrass
a
poor
ignorant
man
like
me
then
why
do
you
meddle
with
scientific
questions
which
you
have
never
studied
asked
the
unknown
brutally
why
answered
ardan
because
the
man
who
does
not
suspect
danger
is
always
brave
i
know
nothing
it
is
true
but
it
is
precisely
my
weakness
that
makes
my
strength
your
weakness
goes
as
far
as
madness
exclaimed
the
unknown
in
a
tone
so
much
the
better
replied
the
frenchman
if
my
madness
takes
me
to
the
moon
barbicane
and
his
colleagues
stared
at
the
intruder
who
had
come
so
boldly
to
stand
in
the
way
of
their
enterprise
none
of
them
knew
him
and
the
president
not
reassured
upon
the
upshot
of
such
a
discussion
looked
at
his
new
friend
with
some
apprehension
the
assembly
was
attentive
and
slightly
uneasy
for
this
struggle
called
attention
to
the
dangers
and
impossibilities
of
the
expedition
sir
resumed
michel
ardan
adversary
the
reasons
that
prove
the
absence
of
all
atmosphere
round
the
moon
are
numerous
and
indisputable
i
may
say
even
that
if
that
atmosphere
had
ever
existed
it
must
have
been
drawn
away
by
the
earth
but
i
would
rather
oppose
you
with
incontestable
facts
oppose
sir
answered
michel
ardan
with
perfect
gallantry
oppose
as
much
as
you
like
you
know
said
the
unknown
that
when
the
sun
rays
traverse
a
medium
like
air
they
are
deviated
from
a
straight
line
or
in
other
words
they
are
refracted
well
when
stars
are
occulted
by
the
moon
their
rays
on
grazing
the
edge
of
her
disc
do
not
show
the
least
deviation
nor
offer
the
slightest
indication
of
refraction
it
follows
therefore
that
the
moon
can
have
no
atmosphere
every
one
looked
at
the
frenchman
for
this
once
admitted
the
consequences
were
rigorous
in
fact
answered
michel
ardan
that
is
your
best
if
not
only
argument
and
a
perhaps
would
be
embarrassed
to
answer
it
i
can
only
tell
you
that
this
argument
has
no
absolute
value
because
it
supposes
the
angular
diameter
of
the
moon
to
be
perfectly
determined
which
it
is
not
but
let
us
waive
that
and
tell
me
my
dear
sir
if
you
admit
the
existence
of
volcanoes
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
extinct
volcanoes
yes
volcanoes
in
eruption
no
for
the
sake
of
argument
let
us
suppose
that
these
volcanoes
have
been
in
eruption
for
a
certain
period
that
is
certain
but
as
they
can
themselves
furnish
the
oxygen
necessary
for
combustion
the
fact
of
their
eruption
does
not
in
the
least
prove
the
presence
of
a
lunar
atmosphere
we
will
pass
on
then
answered
michel
ardan
and
leave
this
series
of
argument
and
arrive
at
direct
observation
but
i
warn
you
that
i
am
going
to
quote
names
very
well
in
the
astronomers
louville
and
halley
observing
the
eclipse
of
the
of
may
remarked
certain
fulminations
of
a
remarkable
nature
these
jets
of
light
rapid
and
frequent
were
attributed
by
them
to
storms
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
moon
in
replied
the
unknown
the
astronomers
louville
and
halley
took
for
lunar
phenomena
phenomena
purely
terrestrial
such
as
meteoric
or
other
bodies
which
are
generated
in
our
own
atmosphere
that
was
the
scientific
aspect
of
these
facts
and
i
go
with
it
let
us
pass
on
again
answered
ardan
without
being
confused
by
the
reply
did
not
herschel
in
observe
a
great
number
of
luminous
points
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
certainly
but
without
explaining
the
origin
of
these
luminous
points
herschel
himself
did
not
thereby
conclude
the
necessity
of
a
lunar
atmosphere
well
answered
said
michel
ardan
complimenting
his
adversary
i
see
that
you
are
well
up
in
selenography
yes
sir
and
i
may
add
that
the
most
skilful
observers
mm
boeer
and
moedler
agree
that
air
is
absolutely
wanting
on
the
moon
surface
a
movement
took
place
amongst
the
audience
who
appeared
struck
by
the
arguments
of
this
singular
personage
we
will
pass
on
again
answered
michel
ardan
with
the
greatest
calmness
and
arrive
now
at
an
important
fact
a
skilful
french
astronomer
laussedat
whilst
observing
the
eclipse
of
july
proved
that
the
horns
of
the
solar
crescent
were
rounded
and
truncated
now
this
appearance
could
only
have
been
produced
by
a
deviation
of
the
solar
rays
in
traversing
the
atmosphere
of
the
moon
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
of
the
fact
but
is
this
fact
authenticated
it
is
absolutely
certain
an
inverse
movement
brought
back
the
audience
to
the
side
of
their
favourite
hero
whose
adversary
remained
silent
ardan
went
on
speaking
without
showing
any
vanity
about
his
last
advantage
he
said
simply
you
see
therefore
my
dear
sir
that
it
can
not
be
positively
affirmed
that
there
is
no
atmosphere
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
this
atmosphere
is
probably
not
dense
but
science
now
generally
admits
that
it
exists
not
upon
the
mountains
replied
the
unknown
who
would
not
give
in
no
but
in
the
depths
of
the
valleys
and
it
is
not
more
than
some
hundreds
of
feet
deep
any
way
you
will
do
well
to
take
your
precautions
for
the
air
will
be
terribly
rarefied
oh
there
will
always
be
enough
for
one
man
besides
once
delivered
up
there
i
shall
do
my
best
to
economise
it
and
only
to
breathe
it
on
great
occasions
a
formidable
burst
of
laughter
saluted
the
mysterious
interlocutor
who
looked
round
the
assembly
daring
it
proudly
then
resumed
michel
ardan
carelessly
as
we
are
agreed
upon
the
presence
of
some
atmosphere
we
are
forced
to
admit
the
presence
of
some
water
a
consequence
i
am
delighted
with
for
my
part
besides
i
have
another
observation
to
make
we
only
know
one
side
of
the
moon
disc
and
if
there
is
little
air
on
that
side
there
may
be
much
on
the
other
how
so
because
the
moon
under
the
action
of
terrestrial
attraction
has
assumed
the
form
of
an
egg
of
which
we
see
the
small
end
hence
the
consequence
due
to
the
calculations
of
hausen
that
its
centre
of
gravity
is
situated
in
the
other
hemisphere
hence
this
conclusion
that
all
the
masses
of
air
and
water
have
been
drawn
to
the
other
side
of
our
satellite
in
the
first
days
of
the
creation
pure
fancies
exclaimed
the
unknown
no
pure
theories
based
upon
mechanical
laws
and
it
appears
difficult
to
me
to
refute
them
i
make
appeal
to
this
assembly
and
put
it
to
the
vote
to
know
if
life
such
as
it
exists
upon
earth
is
possible
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
three
hundred
thousand
hearers
applauded
this
proposition
michel
ardan
adversary
wished
to
speak
again
but
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
cries
and
threats
were
hailed
upon
him
enough
enough
said
some
turn
him
out
repeated
others
but
he
holding
on
to
the
platform
did
not
move
and
let
the
storm
pass
by
it
might
have
assumed
formidable
proportions
if
michel
ardan
had
not
appeased
it
by
a
gesture
he
was
too
chivalrous
to
abandon
his
contradicter
in
such
an
extremity
you
wish
to
add
a
few
words
he
asked
in
the
most
gracious
tone
yes
a
hundred
a
thousand
answered
the
unknown
carried
away
or
rather
no
one
only
to
persevere
in
your
enterprise
you
must
be
imprudent
how
can
you
call
me
that
when
i
have
asked
for
a
bullet
from
my
friend
barbicane
so
as
not
to
turn
round
on
the
road
like
a
squirrel
but
unfortunate
man
the
fearful
shock
will
smash
you
to
pieces
when
you
start
you
have
there
put
your
finger
upon
the
real
and
only
difficulty
but
i
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
the
industrial
genius
of
the
americans
to
believe
that
they
will
not
overcome
that
difficulty
but
the
heat
developed
by
the
speed
of
the
projectile
whilst
crossing
the
beds
of
air
oh
its
sides
are
thick
and
i
shall
so
soon
pass
the
atmosphere
but
provisions
water
i
have
calculated
that
i
could
carry
enough
for
one
year
and
i
shall
only
be
four
days
going
but
air
to
breathe
on
the
road
i
shall
make
some
by
chemical
processes
but
your
fall
upon
the
moon
supposing
you
ever
get
there
it
will
be
six
times
less
rapid
than
a
fall
upon
the
earth
as
attraction
is
six
times
less
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
but
it
still
will
be
sufficient
to
smash
you
like
glass
what
will
prevent
me
delaying
my
fall
by
means
of
rockets
conveniently
placed
and
lighted
at
the
proper
time
but
lastly
supposing
that
all
difficulties
be
solved
all
obstacles
cleared
away
by
uniting
every
chance
in
your
favour
admitting
that
you
reach
the
moon
safe
and
well
how
shall
you
come
back
i
shall
not
come
back
upon
this
answer
which
was
almost
sublime
by
reason
of
its
simplicity
the
assembly
remained
silent
but
its
silence
was
more
eloquent
than
its
cries
of
enthusiasm
would
have
been
the
unknown
profited
by
it
to
protest
one
last
time
you
will
infallibly
kill
yourself
he
cried
and
your
death
which
will
be
only
a
madman
death
will
not
even
be
useful
to
science
go
on
most
generous
of
men
for
you
prophesy
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
ah
it
is
too
much
exclaimed
michel
ardan
adversary
and
i
do
not
know
why
i
go
on
with
so
childish
a
discussion
go
on
with
your
mad
enterprise
as
you
like
it
is
not
your
fault
fire
away
no
another
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
your
acts
who
is
that
pray
asked
michel
ardan
in
an
imperious
voice
the
fool
who
has
organised
this
attempt
as
impossible
as
it
is
ridiculous
the
attack
was
direct
barbicane
since
the
intervention
of
the
unknown
had
made
violent
efforts
to
contain
himself
and
consume
his
own
smoke
but
upon
seeing
himself
so
outrageously
designated
he
rose
directly
and
was
going
to
walk
towards
his
adversary
who
dared
him
to
his
face
when
he
felt
himself
suddenly
separated
from
him
the
platform
was
lifted
up
all
at
once
by
a
hundred
vigorous
arms
and
the
president
of
the
gun
club
was
forced
to
share
the
honours
of
triumph
with
michel
ardan
the
platform
was
heavy
but
the
bearers
came
in
continuous
relays
disputing
struggling
even
fighting
for
the
privilege
of
lending
the
support
of
their
shoulders
to
this
manifestation
however
the
unknown
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
tumult
to
leave
the
place
he
kept
in
the
front
row
his
arms
folded
still
staring
at
president
barbicane
the
president
did
not
lose
sight
of
him
either
and
the
eyes
of
these
two
men
met
like
flaming
swords
the
cries
of
the
immense
crowds
kept
at
their
maximum
of
intensity
during
this
triumphant
march
michel
ardan
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
with
evident
pleasure
sometimes
the
platform
pitched
and
tossed
like
a
ship
beaten
by
the
waves
but
the
two
heroes
of
the
meeting
were
good
sailors
and
their
vessel
safely
arrived
in
the
port
of
tampa
town
michel
ardan
happily
succeeded
in
escaping
from
his
vigorous
admirers
he
fled
to
the
franklin
hotel
quickly
reached
his
room
and
glided
rapidly
into
bed
whilst
an
army
of
men
watched
under
his
windows
in
the
meanwhile
a
short
grave
and
decisive
scene
had
taken
place
between
the
mysterious
personage
and
the
president
of
the
gun
club
barbicane
liberated
at
last
went
straight
to
his
adversary
come
said
he
in
a
curt
voice
the
stranger
followed
him
on
to
the
quay
and
they
were
soon
both
alone
at
the
entrance
to
a
wharf
opening
on
to
jones
fall
there
these
enemies
still
unknown
to
one
another
looked
at
each
other
who
are
you
asked
barbicane
captain
nicholl
i
thought
so
until
now
fate
has
never
made
you
cross
my
path
i
crossed
it
of
my
own
accord
you
have
insulted
me
publicly
and
you
shall
give
me
satisfaction
for
that
insult
now
this
minute
no
i
wish
everything
between
us
to
be
kept
secret
there
is
a
wood
situated
three
miles
from
tampa
skersnaw
wood
do
you
know
it
yes
will
you
enter
it
morning
at
five
by
one
side
yes
if
you
will
enter
it
by
the
other
at
the
same
time
and
you
will
not
forget
your
rifle
said
barbicane
not
more
than
you
will
forget
yours
answered
captain
nicholl
after
these
words
had
been
coldly
pronounced
the
president
of
the
gun
club
and
the
captain
separated
barbicane
returned
to
his
dwelling
but
instead
of
taking
some
hours
rest
he
passed
the
night
in
seeking
means
to
avoid
the
shock
of
the
projectile
and
to
solve
the
difficult
problem
given
by
michel
ardan
at
the
meeting
chapter
xxi
how
a
frenchman
settles
an
affair
whilst
the
duel
was
being
discussed
between
the
president
and
the
captain
a
terrible
and
savage
duel
in
which
each
adversary
became
a
michel
ardan
was
resting
after
the
fatigues
of
his
triumph
resting
is
evidently
not
the
right
expression
for
american
beds
rival
in
hardness
tables
of
marble
or
granite
ardan
slept
badly
turning
over
and
over
between
the
that
served
him
for
sheets
and
he
was
thinking
of
installing
a
more
comfortable
bed
in
his
projectile
when
a
violent
noise
startled
him
from
his
slumbers
thundering
blows
shook
his
door
they
seemed
to
be
administered
with
an
iron
instrument
shouts
were
heard
in
this
racket
rather
too
early
to
be
agreeable
open
some
one
cried
open
for
heaven
sake
there
was
no
reason
why
ardan
should
acquiesce
in
so
peremptory
a
demand
still
he
rose
and
opened
his
door
at
the
moment
it
was
giving
way
under
the
efforts
of
the
obstinate
visitor
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
bounded
into
the
room
a
bomb
would
not
have
entered
with
less
ceremony
yesterday
evening
exclaimed
maston
our
president
was
publicly
insulted
during
the
meeting
he
has
challenged
his
adversary
who
is
no
other
than
captain
nicholl
they
are
going
to
fight
this
morning
in
skersnaw
wood
i
learnt
it
all
from
barbicane
himself
if
he
is
killed
our
project
will
be
at
an
end
this
duel
must
be
prevented
now
one
man
only
can
have
enough
empire
over
barbicane
to
stop
it
and
that
man
is
michel
ardan
whilst
maston
was
speaking
thus
michel
ardan
giving
up
interrupting
him
jumped
into
his
vast
trousers
and
in
less
than
two
minutes
after
the
two
friends
were
rushing
as
fast
as
they
could
go
towards
the
suburbs
of
tampa
town
it
was
during
this
rapid
course
that
maston
told
ardan
the
state
of
the
case
he
told
him
the
real
causes
of
the
enmity
between
barbicane
and
nicholl
how
that
enmity
was
of
old
date
why
until
then
thanks
to
mutual
friends
the
president
and
the
captain
had
never
met
he
added
that
it
was
solely
a
rivalry
between
and
bullet
and
lastly
that
the
scene
of
the
meeting
had
only
been
an
occasion
long
sought
by
nicholl
to
satisfy
an
old
grudge
there
is
nothing
more
terrible
than
these
private
duels
in
america
during
which
the
two
adversaries
seek
each
other
across
thickets
and
hunt
each
other
like
wild
animals
it
is
then
that
each
must
envy
those
marvellous
qualities
so
natural
to
the
indians
of
the
prairies
their
rapid
intelligence
their
ingenious
ruse
their
scent
of
the
enemy
an
error
a
hesitation
a
wrong
step
may
cause
death
in
these
meetings
the
yankees
are
often
accompanied
by
their
dogs
and
both
sportsmen
and
game
go
on
for
hours
what
demons
you
are
exclaimed
michel
ardan
when
his
companion
had
depicted
the
scene
with
much
energy
we
are
what
we
are
answered
maston
modestly
but
let
us
make
haste
in
vain
did
michel
ardan
and
he
rush
across
the
plain
still
wet
with
dew
jump
the
creeks
take
the
shortest
cuts
they
could
not
reach
skersnaw
wood
before
five
barbicane
must
have
entered
it
before
there
an
old
bushman
was
tying
up
faggots
his
axe
had
cut
maston
ran
to
him
crying
have
you
seen
a
man
enter
the
wood
armed
with
a
rifle
barbicane
the
president
my
best
friend
the
worthy
secretary
of
the
gun
club
thought
na√Øvely
that
all
the
world
must
know
his
president
but
the
bushman
did
not
seem
to
understand
a
sportsman
then
said
ardan
a
sportsman
yes
answered
the
bushman
is
it
long
since
about
an
hour
ago
too
late
exclaimed
maston
have
you
heard
any
firing
asked
michel
ardan
no
not
one
shot
not
one
that
sportsman
does
not
seem
to
bag
much
game
what
shall
we
do
said
maston
enter
the
wood
at
the
risk
of
catching
a
bullet
not
meant
for
us
ah
exclaimed
maston
with
an
unmistakable
accent
i
would
rather
have
ten
bullets
in
my
head
than
one
in
barbicane
head
go
ahead
then
said
ardan
pressing
his
companion
hand
a
few
seconds
after
the
two
companions
disappeared
in
a
copse
it
was
a
dense
thicket
made
of
huge
cypresses
sycamores
olives
tamarinds
oaks
and
magnolias
the
different
trees
intermingled
their
branches
in
inextricable
confusion
and
quite
hid
the
view
michel
ardan
and
maston
walked
on
side
by
side
phasing
silently
through
the
tall
grass
making
a
road
for
themselves
through
the
vigorous
creepers
looking
in
all
the
bushes
or
branches
lost
in
the
sombre
shade
of
the
foliage
and
expecting
to
hear
a
shot
at
every
step
as
to
the
traces
that
barbicane
must
have
left
of
his
passage
through
the
wood
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
see
them
and
they
marched
blindly
on
in
the
paths
in
which
an
indian
would
have
followed
his
adversary
step
by
step
after
a
vain
search
of
about
an
hour
length
the
two
companions
stopped
their
anxiety
was
redoubled
it
must
be
all
over
said
maston
in
despair
a
man
like
barbicane
would
not
lay
traps
or
condescend
to
any
manoeuvre
he
is
too
frank
too
courageous
he
has
gone
straight
into
danger
and
doubtless
far
enough
from
the
bushman
for
the
wind
to
carry
off
the
noise
of
the
shot
but
we
should
have
heard
it
answered
michel
ardan
but
what
if
we
came
too
late
exclaimed
maston
in
an
accent
of
despair
michel
ardan
did
not
find
any
answer
to
make
maston
and
he
resumed
their
interrupted
walk
from
time
to
time
they
shouted
they
called
either
barbicane
or
nicholl
but
neither
of
the
two
adversaries
answered
joyful
flocks
of
birds
roused
by
the
noise
disappeared
amongst
the
branches
and
some
frightened
deer
fled
through
the
copses
they
continued
their
search
another
hour
the
greater
part
of
the
wood
had
been
explored
nothing
revealed
the
presence
of
the
combatants
they
began
to
doubt
the
affirmation
of
the
bushman
and
ardan
was
going
to
renounce
the
pursuit
as
useless
when
all
at
once
maston
stopped
hush
said
he
there
is
some
one
yonder
some
one
answered
michel
ardan
yes
a
man
he
does
not
seem
to
move
his
rifle
is
not
in
his
hand
what
can
he
be
doing
but
do
you
recognise
him
asked
michel
ardan
yes
yes
he
is
turning
round
answered
maston
who
is
it
captain
nicholl
nicholl
cried
michel
ardan
whose
heart
almost
stopped
beating
nicholl
disarmed
then
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
his
adversary
let
us
go
to
him
said
michel
ardan
we
shall
know
how
it
is
but
his
companion
and
he
had
not
gone
fifty
steps
when
they
stopped
to
examine
the
captain
more
attentively
they
imagined
they
should
find
a
bloodthirsty
and
revengeful
man
upon
seeing
him
they
remained
stupefied
a
net
with
fine
meshes
was
hung
between
two
gigantic
and
in
it
a
small
bird
with
its
wings
entangled
was
struggling
with
plaintive
cries
the
who
had
hung
the
net
was
not
a
human
being
but
a
venomous
spider
peculiar
to
the
country
as
large
as
a
pigeon
egg
and
furnished
with
enormous
legs
the
hideous
insect
as
he
was
rushing
on
his
prey
was
forced
to
turn
back
and
take
refuge
in
the
high
branches
of
a
for
a
formidable
enemy
threatened
him
in
his
turn
in
fact
captain
nicholl
with
his
gun
on
the
ground
forgetting
the
dangers
of
his
situation
was
occupied
in
delivering
as
delicately
as
possible
the
victim
taken
in
the
meshes
of
the
monstrous
spider
when
he
had
finished
he
let
the
little
bird
fly
away
it
fluttered
its
wings
joyfully
and
disappeared
nicholl
touched
was
watching
it
fly
through
the
copse
when
he
heard
these
words
uttered
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
you
are
a
brave
man
you
are
he
turned
michel
ardan
was
in
front
of
him
repeating
in
every
tone
and
a
kind
one
michel
ardan
exclaimed
the
captain
what
have
you
come
here
for
sir
to
shake
hands
with
you
nicholl
and
prevent
you
killing
barbicane
or
being
killed
by
him
barbicane
cried
the
captain
i
have
been
looking
for
him
these
two
hours
without
finding
him
where
is
he
hiding
himself
nicholl
said
michel
ardan
this
is
not
polite
you
must
always
respect
your
adversary
do
be
uneasy
if
barbicane
is
alive
we
shall
find
him
and
so
much
the
more
easily
that
if
he
has
not
amused
himself
with
protecting
birds
he
must
be
looking
for
you
too
but
when
you
have
found
him
and
michel
ardan
tells
you
this
there
will
be
no
duel
between
you
between
president
barbicane
and
me
answered
nicholl
gravely
there
is
such
rivalry
that
the
death
of
one
of
us
come
come
resumed
michel
ardan
brave
men
like
you
may
detest
one
another
but
they
respect
one
another
too
you
will
not
fight
i
shall
fight
sir
no
you
wo
captain
then
said
maston
heartily
i
am
the
president
friend
his
if
you
must
absolutely
kill
some
one
kill
me
that
will
be
exactly
the
same
thing
sir
said
nicholl
convulsively
seizing
his
rifle
this
joking
friend
maston
is
not
joking
answered
michel
ardan
and
i
understand
his
wanting
to
be
killed
for
the
man
he
loves
but
neither
he
nor
barbicane
will
fall
under
captain
nicholl
bullets
for
i
have
so
tempting
a
proposition
to
make
to
the
two
rivals
that
they
will
hasten
to
accept
it
but
what
is
it
pray
asked
nicholl
with
visible
incredulity
patience
answered
ardan
i
can
only
communicate
it
in
presence
let
us
look
for
him
then
cried
the
captain
the
three
men
immediately
set
out
the
captain
having
discharged
his
rifle
threw
it
on
his
shoulder
and
walked
on
in
silence
during
another
the
search
was
in
vain
maston
was
seized
with
a
sinister
presentiment
he
observed
captain
nicholl
closely
asking
himself
if
once
the
captain
vengeance
satisfied
the
unfortunate
barbicane
had
not
been
left
lying
in
some
bloody
thicket
michel
ardan
seemed
to
have
the
same
thought
and
they
were
both
looking
questioningly
at
captain
nicholl
when
maston
suddenly
stopped
the
motionless
bust
of
a
man
leaning
against
a
gigantic
catalpa
appeared
twenty
feet
off
half
hidden
in
the
grass
it
is
he
said
maston
barbicane
did
not
move
ardan
stared
at
the
captain
but
he
did
not
wince
ardan
rushed
forward
crying
barbicane
barbicane
no
answer
ardan
was
about
to
seize
his
arm
he
stopped
short
uttering
a
cry
of
surprise
barbicane
with
a
pencil
in
his
hand
was
tracing
geometrical
figures
upon
a
whilst
his
unloaded
gun
lay
on
the
ground
absorbed
in
his
work
the
forgetting
in
his
turn
his
duel
and
his
vengeance
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
but
when
michel
ardan
placed
his
hand
on
that
of
the
president
he
got
up
and
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
ah
cried
he
at
last
you
here
i
have
found
it
my
friend
i
have
found
it
what
the
way
to
do
it
the
way
to
do
what
to
counteract
the
effect
of
the
shock
at
the
departure
of
the
projectile
really
said
michel
looking
at
the
captain
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
yes
water
simply
water
which
will
act
as
a
spring
ah
maston
cried
barbicane
you
too
himself
answered
michel
ardan
and
allow
me
to
introduce
at
the
same
time
the
worthy
captain
nicholl
nicholl
cried
barbicane
up
in
a
moment
excuse
me
captain
said
he
i
had
forgotten
i
am
ready
michel
ardan
interfered
before
the
two
enemies
had
time
to
recriminate
faith
said
he
it
is
fortunate
that
brave
fellows
like
you
did
not
meet
sooner
we
should
now
have
to
mourn
for
one
or
other
of
you
but
thanks
to
god
who
has
prevented
it
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
when
one
forgets
his
hatred
to
plunge
into
mechanical
problems
and
the
other
to
play
tricks
on
spiders
their
hatred
can
not
be
dangerous
to
anybody
and
michel
ardan
related
the
captain
story
to
the
president
i
ask
you
now
said
he
as
he
concluded
if
two
good
beings
like
you
were
made
to
break
each
other
heads
with
gunshots
there
was
in
this
rather
ridiculous
situation
something
so
unexpected
that
barbicane
and
nicholl
did
not
know
how
to
look
at
one
another
michel
ardan
felt
this
and
resolved
to
try
for
a
reconciliation
my
brave
friends
said
he
smiling
in
his
most
fascinating
manner
it
has
all
been
a
mistake
between
you
nothing
more
well
to
prove
that
all
is
ended
between
you
and
as
you
are
men
who
risk
your
lives
frankly
accept
the
proposition
that
i
am
going
to
make
to
you
speak
said
nicholl
friend
barbicane
believes
that
his
projectile
will
go
straight
to
the
moon
yes
certainly
replied
the
president
and
friend
nicholl
is
persuaded
that
it
will
fall
back
on
the
earth
i
am
certain
of
it
cried
the
captain
good
resumed
michel
ardan
i
do
not
pretend
to
make
you
agree
all
i
say
to
you
is
with
me
and
see
if
we
shall
stop
on
the
road
what
said
maston
stupefied
the
two
rivals
at
this
sudden
proposition
had
raised
their
eyes
and
looked
at
each
other
attentively
barbicane
waited
for
captain
answer
nicholl
awaited
the
president
reply
well
said
michel
in
his
most
engaging
tone
as
there
is
now
no
shock
to
fear
accepted
cried
barbicane
but
although
this
word
was
uttered
very
quickly
nicholl
had
finished
it
at
the
same
time
hurrah
bravo
cried
michel
ardan
holding
out
his
hands
to
the
two
adversaries
and
now
that
the
affair
is
arranged
my
friends
allow
me
to
treat
you
french
fashion
chapter
xxii
the
new
citizen
of
the
united
states
that
day
all
america
heard
about
the
duel
and
its
singular
termination
the
part
played
by
the
chivalrous
european
his
unexpected
proposition
which
solved
the
difficulty
the
simultaneous
acceptation
of
the
two
rivals
that
conquest
of
the
lunar
continent
to
which
france
and
the
united
states
were
going
to
march
in
concert
everything
tended
to
increase
michel
ardan
popularity
it
is
well
known
how
enthusiastic
the
yankees
will
get
about
an
individual
in
a
country
where
grave
magistrates
harness
themselves
to
a
dancer
carriage
and
draw
it
in
triumph
it
may
be
judged
how
the
bold
frenchman
was
treated
if
they
did
not
take
out
his
horses
it
was
probably
because
he
had
none
but
all
other
marks
of
enthusiasm
were
showered
upon
him
there
was
no
citizen
who
did
not
join
him
heart
and
mind
pluribus
according
to
the
motto
of
the
united
states
from
that
day
michel
ardan
had
not
a
minute
rest
deputations
from
all
parts
of
the
union
worried
him
incessantly
he
was
forced
to
receive
them
whether
he
would
or
no
the
hands
he
shook
could
not
be
counted
he
was
soon
completely
worn
out
his
voice
became
hoarse
in
consequence
of
his
innumerable
speeches
and
only
escaped
from
his
lips
in
unintelligible
sounds
and
he
nearly
caught
a
after
the
toasts
he
proposed
to
the
union
this
success
would
have
intoxicated
another
man
from
the
first
but
he
managed
to
stay
in
a
and
charming
amongst
the
deputations
of
every
sort
that
assailed
him
that
of
the
lunatics
did
not
forget
what
they
owed
to
the
future
conqueror
of
the
moon
one
day
some
of
these
poor
creatures
numerous
enough
in
america
went
to
him
and
asked
to
return
with
him
to
their
native
country
some
of
them
pretended
to
speak
selenite
and
wished
to
teach
it
to
michel
ardan
who
willingly
lent
himself
to
their
innocent
mania
and
promised
to
take
their
messages
to
their
friends
in
the
moon
singular
folly
said
he
to
barbicane
after
having
dismissed
them
and
a
folly
that
often
takes
possession
of
men
of
great
intelligence
one
of
our
most
illustrious
arago
told
me
that
many
very
wise
and
reserved
people
in
their
conceptions
became
much
excited
and
gave
way
to
incredible
singularities
every
time
the
moon
occupied
them
do
you
believe
in
the
influence
of
the
moon
upon
maladies
very
little
answered
the
president
of
the
gun
club
i
do
not
either
and
yet
history
has
preserved
some
facts
that
to
say
the
least
are
astonishing
thus
in
during
an
epidemic
people
perished
in
the
greatest
numbers
on
the
of
january
during
an
eclipse
the
celebrated
bacon
fainted
during
the
moon
eclipses
and
only
came
to
himself
after
its
entire
emersion
king
charles
vi
relapsed
six
times
into
madness
during
the
year
either
at
the
new
or
full
moon
physicians
have
ranked
epilepsy
amongst
the
maladies
that
follow
the
phases
of
the
moon
nervous
maladies
have
often
appeared
to
be
influenced
by
it
mead
speaks
of
a
child
who
had
convulsions
when
the
moon
was
in
opposition
gall
remarked
that
insane
persons
underwent
an
accession
of
their
disorder
twice
in
every
month
at
the
epochs
of
the
new
and
full
moon
lastly
a
thousand
observations
of
this
sort
made
upon
malignant
fevers
and
somnambulism
tend
to
prove
that
the
queen
of
night
has
a
mysterious
influence
upon
terrestrial
maladies
but
how
why
asked
barbicane
why
answered
ardan
why
the
only
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
what
arago
repeated
nineteen
centuries
after
plutarch
perhaps
it
is
because
it
is
not
true
in
the
height
of
his
triumph
michel
ardan
could
not
escape
any
of
the
annoyances
incidental
to
a
celebrated
man
managers
of
entertainments
wished
to
exhibit
him
barnum
offered
him
a
million
dollars
to
show
him
as
a
curious
animal
in
the
different
towns
of
the
united
states
still
though
he
refused
to
satisfy
public
curiosity
in
that
way
his
portraits
went
all
over
the
world
and
occupied
the
place
of
honour
in
albums
proofs
were
made
of
all
sizes
from
life
size
to
medallions
every
one
could
possess
the
hero
in
all
positions
head
bust
standing
profile
back
fifteen
hundred
thousand
copies
were
taken
and
it
would
have
been
a
fine
occasion
to
get
money
by
relics
but
he
did
not
profit
by
it
if
he
had
sold
his
hairs
for
a
dollar
apiece
there
would
have
remained
enough
to
make
his
fortune
to
tell
the
truth
this
popularity
did
not
displease
him
on
the
contrary
he
put
himself
at
the
disposition
of
the
public
and
corresponded
with
the
entire
universe
they
repeated
his
witticisms
especially
those
he
did
not
perpetrate
not
only
had
he
all
the
men
for
him
but
the
women
too
what
an
infinite
number
of
good
marriages
he
might
have
made
if
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
settle
old
maids
especially
dreamt
before
his
portraits
day
and
night
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
found
female
companions
by
hundreds
even
if
he
had
imposed
the
condition
of
following
him
up
into
the
air
women
are
intrepid
when
they
are
not
afraid
of
everything
but
he
had
no
intention
of
transplanting
a
race
of
upon
the
lunar
continent
so
he
refused
i
do
not
mean
said
he
to
play
the
part
of
adam
with
a
daughter
of
eve
up
there
i
might
meet
with
serpents
as
soon
as
he
could
withdraw
from
the
joys
of
triumph
too
often
repeated
he
went
with
his
friends
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
columbiad
he
owed
it
that
besides
he
was
getting
very
learned
in
ballistics
since
he
had
lived
with
barbicane
maston
and
his
greatest
pleasure
consisted
in
repeating
to
these
brave
artillerymen
that
they
were
only
amiable
and
learned
murderers
he
was
always
joking
about
it
the
day
he
visited
the
columbiad
he
greatly
admired
it
and
went
down
to
the
bore
of
the
gigantic
mortar
that
was
soon
to
hurl
him
towards
the
queen
of
night
at
least
said
he
that
cannon
will
not
hurt
anybody
which
is
already
very
astonishing
on
the
part
of
a
cannon
but
as
to
your
engines
that
destroy
burn
smash
and
kill
do
talk
to
me
about
them
it
is
necessary
to
report
here
a
proposition
made
by
maston
when
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
heard
barbicane
and
nicholl
accept
michel
ardan
proposition
he
resolved
to
join
them
and
make
a
party
of
four
one
day
he
asked
to
go
barbicane
grieved
at
having
to
refuse
made
him
understand
that
the
projectile
could
not
carry
so
many
passengers
maston
in
despair
went
to
michel
ardan
who
advised
him
to
be
resigned
adding
one
or
two
arguments
you
see
old
fellow
he
said
to
him
you
must
not
be
offended
but
really
between
ourselves
you
are
too
incomplete
to
present
yourself
in
the
moon
incomplete
cried
the
valiant
cripple
yes
my
brave
friend
suppose
we
should
meet
with
inhabitants
up
there
do
you
want
to
give
them
a
sorry
idea
of
what
goes
on
here
teach
them
what
war
is
show
them
that
we
employ
the
best
part
of
our
time
in
devouring
each
other
and
breaking
arms
and
limbs
and
that
upon
a
globe
that
could
feed
a
hundred
thousand
millions
of
inhabitants
and
where
there
are
hardly
twelve
hundred
millions
why
my
worthy
friend
you
would
have
us
shown
to
the
door
but
if
you
arrive
smashed
to
pieces
replied
maston
you
will
be
as
incomplete
as
i
certainly
answered
michel
ardan
but
we
shall
not
arrive
in
pieces
in
fact
a
preparatory
experiment
tried
on
the
of
october
had
been
attended
with
the
best
results
and
given
rise
to
the
most
legitimate
hopes
barbicane
wishing
to
know
the
effect
of
the
shock
at
the
moment
of
the
projectile
departure
sent
for
a
mortar
from
pensacola
arsenal
it
was
installed
upon
the
quay
of
hillisboro
harbour
in
order
that
the
bomb
might
fall
into
the
sea
and
the
shock
of
its
fall
be
deadened
he
only
wished
to
experiment
upon
the
shock
of
its
departure
not
that
of
its
arrival
a
hollow
projectile
was
prepared
with
the
greatest
care
for
this
curious
experiment
a
thick
wadding
put
upon
a
network
of
springs
made
of
the
best
steel
lined
it
inside
it
was
quite
a
wadded
nest
what
a
pity
one
ca
go
in
it
said
maston
regretting
that
his
size
did
not
allow
him
to
make
the
venture
into
this
charming
bomb
which
was
closed
by
means
of
a
lid
screwed
down
they
put
first
a
large
cat
then
a
squirrel
belonging
to
the
perpetual
secretary
of
the
gun
club
which
maston
was
very
fond
of
but
they
wished
to
know
how
this
little
animal
not
likely
to
be
giddy
would
support
this
experimental
journey
the
mortar
was
loaded
with
lbs
of
powder
and
the
bomb
it
was
then
fired
the
projectile
immediately
rose
with
rapidity
described
a
majestic
parabola
attained
a
height
of
about
a
thousand
feet
and
then
with
a
graceful
curve
fell
into
the
waves
without
losing
an
instant
a
vessel
was
sent
to
the
spot
where
it
fell
skilful
divers
sank
under
water
and
fastened
to
the
handles
of
the
bomb
which
was
rapidly
hoisted
on
board
five
minutes
had
not
elapsed
between
the
time
the
animals
were
shut
up
and
the
unscrewing
of
their
prison
lid
ardan
barbicane
maston
and
nicholl
were
upon
the
vessel
and
they
assisted
at
the
operation
with
a
sentiment
of
interest
easy
to
understand
the
bomb
was
hardly
opened
before
the
cat
sprang
out
rather
bruised
but
quite
lively
and
not
looking
as
if
it
had
just
returned
from
an
a√´rial
expedition
but
nothing
was
seen
of
the
squirrel
the
truth
was
then
discovered
the
cat
had
eaten
its
travelling
companion
maston
was
very
grieved
at
the
loss
of
his
poor
squirrel
and
proposed
to
inscribe
it
in
the
martyrology
of
science
however
that
may
be
after
this
experiment
all
hesitation
and
fear
were
at
an
end
besides
barbicane
plans
were
destined
further
to
perfect
the
projectile
and
destroy
almost
entirely
the
effect
of
the
shock
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
start
two
days
later
michel
ardan
received
a
message
from
the
president
of
the
union
an
honour
which
he
much
appreciated
after
the
example
of
his
chivalrous
countryman
la
fayette
the
government
had
bestowed
upon
him
the
title
of
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
chapter
xxiii
the
projectile
compartment
after
the
celebrated
columbiad
was
completed
public
interest
immediately
centred
upon
the
projectile
the
new
vehicle
destined
to
transport
the
three
bold
adventurers
across
space
no
one
had
forgotten
that
in
his
despatch
of
september
michel
ardan
asked
for
a
modification
of
the
plans
laid
out
by
the
members
of
the
committee
president
barbicane
then
thought
with
reason
that
the
form
of
the
projectile
was
of
slight
importance
for
after
crossing
the
atmosphere
in
a
few
seconds
it
would
meet
with
vacuum
the
committee
had
therefore
chosen
the
round
form
so
that
the
ball
might
turn
over
and
over
and
do
as
it
liked
but
as
soon
as
it
had
to
be
made
into
a
vehicle
that
was
another
thing
michel
ardan
did
not
want
to
travel
he
wished
to
go
up
head
up
and
feet
down
with
as
much
dignity
as
in
the
car
of
a
balloon
quicker
of
course
but
without
unseemly
gambols
new
plans
were
therefore
sent
to
the
firm
of
breadwill
and
of
albany
with
the
recommendation
to
execute
them
without
delay
the
projectile
thus
modified
was
cast
on
the
of
november
and
sent
immediately
to
stony
hill
by
the
eastern
railway
on
the
it
arrived
without
accident
at
its
place
of
destination
michel
ardan
barbicane
and
nicholl
awaited
with
the
most
lively
impatience
this
projectile
compartment
in
which
they
were
to
take
their
passage
for
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
magnificent
piece
of
metal
a
metallurgic
production
that
did
the
greatest
honour
to
the
industrial
genius
of
the
americans
it
was
the
first
time
that
aluminium
had
been
obtained
in
so
large
a
mass
which
result
might
be
justly
regarded
as
prodigious
this
precious
projectile
sparkled
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
seeing
it
in
its
imposing
shape
with
its
conical
top
it
might
easily
have
been
taken
for
one
of
those
towers
that
architects
of
the
middle
ages
put
at
the
angles
of
their
castles
it
only
wanted
loopholes
and
a
weathercock
i
expect
exclaimed
michel
ardan
to
see
a
man
armed
come
out
of
it
we
shall
be
like
feudal
lords
in
there
with
a
little
artillery
we
could
hold
our
own
against
a
whole
army
of
selenites
that
is
if
there
are
any
in
the
moon
then
the
vehicle
pleases
you
asked
barbicane
yes
yes
certainly
answered
michel
ardan
who
was
examining
it
as
an
artist
i
only
regret
that
its
form
is
not
a
little
more
slender
its
cone
more
graceful
it
ought
to
be
terminated
by
a
metal
group
some
gothic
ornament
a
salamander
escaping
from
it
with
outspread
wings
and
open
beak
what
would
be
the
use
said
barbicane
whose
positive
mind
was
little
sensitive
to
the
beauties
of
art
ah
friend
barbicane
i
am
afraid
you
will
never
understand
the
use
or
you
would
not
ask
well
tell
me
at
all
events
my
brave
companion
well
my
friend
i
think
we
ought
always
to
put
a
little
art
in
all
we
do
do
you
know
an
indian
play
called
child
not
even
by
name
answered
barbicane
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
continued
michel
ardan
learn
then
that
in
that
play
there
is
a
robber
who
when
in
the
act
of
piercing
the
wall
of
a
house
stops
to
consider
whether
he
shall
make
his
hole
in
the
shape
of
a
lyre
a
flower
or
a
bird
well
tell
me
friend
barbicane
if
at
that
epoch
you
had
been
his
judge
would
you
have
condemned
that
robber
without
hesitation
answered
the
president
of
the
gun
club
and
as
a
burglar
too
well
i
should
have
acquitted
him
friend
barbicane
that
is
why
you
could
never
understand
me
i
will
not
even
try
my
valiant
artist
but
at
least
continued
michel
ardan
as
the
exterior
of
our
projectile
compartment
leaves
much
to
be
desired
i
shall
be
allowed
to
furnish
the
inside
as
i
choose
and
with
all
luxury
suitable
to
ambassadors
from
the
earth
about
that
my
brave
michel
answered
barbicane
you
can
do
entirely
as
you
please
but
before
passing
to
the
agreeable
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
thought
of
the
useful
and
the
means
he
had
invented
for
lessening
the
effects
of
the
shock
were
applied
with
perfect
intelligence
barbicane
had
said
to
himself
not
unreasonably
that
no
spring
would
be
sufficiently
powerful
to
deaden
the
shock
and
during
his
famous
promenade
in
skersnaw
wood
he
had
ended
by
solving
this
great
difficulty
in
an
ingenious
fashion
he
depended
upon
water
to
render
him
this
signal
service
this
is
how
the
projectile
was
to
be
filled
to
the
depth
of
three
feet
with
water
destined
to
support
a
wooden
disc
which
easily
worked
within
the
walls
of
the
projectile
it
was
upon
this
raft
that
the
travellers
were
to
take
their
place
as
to
the
liquid
mass
it
was
divided
by
horizontal
partitions
which
the
departing
shock
would
successively
break
then
each
sheet
of
water
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
escaping
by
valves
in
the
upper
part
of
the
projectile
thus
making
a
spring
and
the
disc
itself
furnished
with
extremely
powerful
buffers
could
not
strike
the
bottom
until
it
had
successively
broken
the
different
partitions
the
travellers
would
doubtless
feel
a
violent
recoil
after
the
complete
escape
of
the
liquid
mass
but
the
first
shock
would
be
almost
entirely
deadened
by
so
powerful
a
spring
it
is
true
that
three
feet
on
a
surface
of
square
feet
would
weigh
nearly
lbs
but
the
escape
of
gas
accumulated
in
the
columbiad
would
suffice
barbicane
thought
to
conquer
that
increase
of
weight
besides
the
shock
would
send
out
all
that
water
in
less
than
a
second
and
the
projectile
would
soon
regain
its
normal
weight
this
is
what
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
imagined
and
how
he
thought
he
had
solved
the
great
question
of
the
recoil
this
work
intelligently
comprehended
by
the
engineers
of
the
breadwill
firm
was
marvellously
executed
the
effect
once
produced
and
the
water
gone
the
travellers
could
easily
get
rid
of
the
broken
partitions
and
take
away
the
mobile
disc
that
bore
them
at
the
moment
of
departure
as
to
the
upper
sides
of
the
projectile
they
were
lined
with
a
thick
wadding
of
leather
put
upon
the
best
steel
springs
as
supple
as
the
hidden
under
this
wadding
were
not
even
seen
all
imaginable
precautions
for
deadening
the
first
shock
having
been
taken
michel
ardan
said
they
must
be
made
of
very
bad
stuff
to
be
crushed
the
projectile
outside
was
nine
feet
wide
and
twelve
feet
high
in
order
not
to
pass
the
weight
assigned
the
sides
had
been
made
a
little
less
thick
and
the
bottom
thicker
as
it
would
have
to
support
all
the
violence
of
the
gases
developed
by
the
deflagration
of
the
pyroxyle
bombs
and
howitzers
are
always
made
with
thicker
bottoms
the
entrance
to
this
tower
of
metal
was
a
narrow
opening
in
the
wall
of
the
cone
like
the
of
steam
boilers
it
closed
hermetically
by
means
of
an
aluminium
plate
fastened
inside
by
powerful
screw
pressure
the
travellers
could
therefore
leave
their
mobile
prison
at
will
as
soon
as
they
had
reached
the
queen
of
night
but
going
was
not
everything
it
was
necessary
to
see
on
the
road
nothing
was
easier
in
fact
under
the
wadding
were
four
thick
lenticular
footlights
two
let
into
the
circular
wall
of
the
projectile
the
third
in
its
lower
part
and
the
fourth
in
its
cone
the
travellers
could
therefore
observe
during
their
journey
the
earth
they
were
leaving
the
moon
they
were
approaching
and
the
constellated
spaces
of
the
sky
these
skylights
were
protected
against
the
shocks
of
departure
by
plates
let
into
solid
grooves
which
it
was
easy
to
move
by
unscrewing
them
by
that
means
the
air
contained
in
the
projectile
could
not
escape
and
it
was
possible
to
make
observations
all
these
mechanical
appliances
admirably
set
worked
with
the
greatest
ease
and
the
engineers
had
not
shown
themselves
less
intelligent
in
the
arrangement
of
the
projectile
compartment
lockers
solidly
fastened
were
destined
to
contain
the
water
and
provisions
necessary
for
the
three
travellers
they
could
even
procure
themselves
fire
and
light
by
means
of
gas
stored
up
in
a
special
case
under
a
pressure
of
several
atmospheres
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
turn
a
tap
and
the
gas
would
light
and
warm
this
comfortable
vehicle
for
six
days
it
will
be
seen
that
none
of
the
things
essential
to
life
or
even
to
comfort
were
wanting
more
thanks
to
the
instincts
of
michel
ardan
the
agreeable
was
joined
to
the
useful
under
the
form
of
objects
of
art
he
would
have
made
a
veritable
artist
studio
of
his
projectile
if
room
had
not
been
wanting
it
would
be
mistaken
to
suppose
that
three
persons
would
be
restricted
for
space
in
that
metal
tower
it
had
a
surface
of
square
feet
and
was
nearly
feet
high
and
allowed
its
occupiers
a
certain
liberty
of
movement
they
would
not
have
been
so
much
at
their
ease
in
the
most
comfortable
railway
compartment
of
the
united
states
the
question
of
provisions
and
lighting
having
been
solved
there
remained
the
question
of
air
it
was
evident
that
the
air
confined
in
the
projectile
would
not
be
sufficient
for
the
travellers
respiration
for
four
days
each
man
in
fact
consumes
in
one
hour
all
the
oxygen
contained
in
litres
of
air
barbicane
his
two
companions
and
two
dogs
that
he
meant
to
take
would
consume
every
hours
litres
of
oxygen
or
a
weight
equal
to
lbs
the
air
in
the
projectile
must
therefore
be
renewed
how
by
a
very
simple
method
that
of
reiset
and
regnault
indicated
by
michel
ardan
during
the
discussion
of
the
meeting
it
is
known
that
the
air
is
composed
principally
of
parts
of
oxygen
and
parts
of
azote
now
what
happens
in
the
act
of
respiration
a
very
simple
phenomenon
man
absorbs
the
oxygen
of
the
air
eminently
adapted
for
sustaining
life
and
throws
out
the
azote
intact
the
air
breathed
out
has
lost
nearly
five
per
cent
of
its
oxygen
and
then
contains
a
nearly
equal
volume
of
carbonic
acid
the
definitive
product
of
the
combustion
of
the
elements
of
the
blood
by
the
oxygen
breathed
in
it
it
happens
therefore
that
in
a
confined
space
and
after
a
certain
time
all
the
oxygen
of
the
air
is
replaced
by
carbonic
acid
an
essentially
deleterious
gas
the
question
was
then
reduced
to
this
the
azote
being
conserved
intact
to
remake
the
oxygen
absorbed
to
destroy
the
carbonic
acid
breathed
out
nothing
easier
to
do
by
means
of
chlorate
of
potash
and
caustic
potash
the
former
is
a
salt
which
appears
under
the
form
of
white
crystals
when
heated
to
a
temperature
of
it
is
transformed
into
chlorine
of
potassium
and
the
oxygen
which
it
contains
is
given
off
freely
now
lbs
of
chlorate
of
potash
give
lbs
of
oxygen
that
is
to
say
the
quantity
necessary
to
the
travellers
for
hours
as
to
caustic
potash
it
has
a
great
affinity
for
carbonic
acid
mixed
in
air
and
it
is
sufficient
to
shake
it
in
order
for
it
to
seize
upon
the
acid
and
form
bicarbonate
of
potash
so
much
for
the
absorption
of
carbonic
acid
by
combining
these
two
methods
they
were
certain
of
giving
back
to
vitiated
air
all
its
qualities
the
two
chemists
reiset
and
regnault
had
made
the
experiment
with
success
but
it
must
be
said
the
experiment
had
only
been
made
anima
whatever
its
scientific
accuracy
might
be
no
one
knew
how
man
could
bear
it
such
was
the
observation
made
at
the
meeting
where
this
grave
question
was
discussed
michel
ardan
meant
to
leave
no
doubt
about
the
possibility
of
living
by
means
of
this
artificial
air
and
he
offered
to
make
the
trial
before
the
departure
but
the
honour
of
putting
it
to
the
proof
was
energetically
claimed
by
maston
as
i
am
not
going
with
you
said
the
brave
artilleryman
the
least
i
can
do
will
be
to
live
in
the
projectile
for
a
week
it
would
have
been
ungracious
to
refuse
him
his
wish
was
complied
with
a
sufficient
quantity
of
chlorate
of
potash
and
caustic

the
telescope
of
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
of
october
of
the
preceding
year
after
the
subscription
list
was
closed
the
president
of
the
gun
club
had
credited
the
cambridge
observatory
with
the
sums
necessary
for
the
construction
of
a
vast
optical
instrument
this
telescope
was
to
be
powerful
enough
to
render
visible
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
an
object
being
at
least
nine
feet
wide
there
is
an
important
difference
between
a
and
a
telescope
which
it
is
well
to
recall
here
a
is
composed
of
a
tube
which
carries
at
its
upper
extremity
a
convex
glass
called
an
and
at
its
lower
extremity
a
second
glass
called
ocular
to
which
the
eye
of
the
observer
is
applied
the
rays
from
the
luminous
object
traverse
the
first
glass
and
by
refraction
form
an
image
upside
down
at
its
focus
this
image
is
looked
at
with
the
ocular
which
magnifies
it
the
tube
of
the
is
therefore
closed
at
each
extremity
by
the
object
and
the
ocular
glasses
the
telescope
on
the
contrary
is
open
at
its
upper
extremity
the
rays
from
the
object
observed
penetrate
freely
into
it
and
strike
a
concave
metallic
mirror
that
is
to
say
they
are
focussed
from
thence
their
reflected
rays
meet
with
a
little
mirror
which
sends
them
back
to
the
ocular
in
such
a
way
as
to
magnify
the
image
produced
thus
in
refraction
plays
the
principal
part
and
reflection
does
in
the
telescope
hence
the
name
of
refractors
given
to
the
former
and
reflectors
given
to
the
latter
all
the
difficulty
in
the
execution
of
these
optical
instruments
lies
in
the
making
of
the
whether
they
be
made
of
glass
or
metallic
mirrors
still
at
the
epoch
when
the
gun
club
made
its
great
experiment
these
instruments
were
singularly
perfected
and
gave
magnificent
results
the
time
was
far
distant
when
galileo
observed
the
stars
with
his
poor
glass
which
magnified
seven
times
at
the
most
since
the
century
optical
instruments
had
widened
and
lengthened
in
considerable
proportions
and
they
allowed
the
stellar
spaces
to
be
gauged
to
a
depth
unknown
before
amongst
the
refracting
instruments
at
work
at
that
period
were
the
glass
of
the
poulkowa
observatory
in
russia
the
of
which
measured
inches
in
width
that
of
the
french
optician
lerebours
furnished
with
an
equally
large
and
lastly
that
of
the
cambridge
observatory
furnished
with
an
inches
in
diameter
amongst
telescopes
two
were
known
of
remarkable
power
and
gigantic
dimensions
the
first
constructed
by
herschel
was
feet
in
length
and
had
an
of
feet
inches
it
magnified
times
the
second
raised
in
ireland
at
birrcastle
in
parsonstown
park
belonged
to
lord
rosse
the
length
of
its
tube
was
feet
and
the
width
of
its
mirror
feet
it
magnified
times
and
it
had
required
an
immense
erection
of
masonry
on
which
to
place
the
apparatus
necessary
for
working
the
instrument
which
weighed
tons
but
it
will
be
seen
that
notwithstanding
these
colossal
dimensions
the
magnifying
power
obtained
did
not
exceed
times
in
round
numbers
now
that
power
would
only
bring
the
moon
within
miles
and
would
only
allow
objects
feet
in
diameter
to
be
perceived
unless
these
objects
were
very
elongated
now
in
space
they
had
to
deal
with
a
projectile
feet
wide
and
long
so
the
moon
had
to
be
brought
within
five
miles
at
least
and
for
that
a
magnifying
power
of
times
was
necessary
such
was
the
problem
propounded
to
the
cambridge
observatory
they
were
not
to
be
stopped
by
financial
difficulties
so
there
only
remained
material
difficulties
first
of
all
they
had
to
choose
between
telescopes
and
the
latter
had
some
advantages
with
equal
they
have
a
greater
magnifying
power
because
the
luminous
rays
that
traverse
the
glasses
lose
less
by
absorption
than
the
reflection
on
the
metallic
mirror
of
telescopes
but
the
thickness
that
can
be
given
to
glass
is
limited
for
too
thick
it
does
not
allow
the
luminous
rays
to
pass
besides
the
construction
of
these
vast
glasses
is
excessively
difficult
and
demands
a
considerable
time
measured
by
years
therefore
although
images
are
better
given
by
glasses
an
inappreciable
advantage
when
the
question
is
to
observe
the
moon
the
light
of
which
is
simply
reflected
they
decided
to
employ
the
telescope
which
is
prompter
in
execution
and
is
capable
of
a
greater
magnifying
power
only
as
the
luminous
rays
lose
much
of
their
intensity
by
traversing
the
atmosphere
the
gun
club
resolved
to
set
up
the
instrument
on
one
of
the
highest
mountains
of
the
union
which
would
diminish
the
depth
of
the
a√´rial
strata
in
telescopes
it
has
been
seen
that
the
glass
placed
at
the
eye
produces
the
magnifying
power
and
the
which
bears
this
power
the
best
is
the
one
that
has
the
largest
diameter
and
the
greatest
focal
distance
in
order
to
magnify
times
it
must
be
much
larger
than
those
of
herschel
and
lord
rosse
there
lay
the
difficulty
for
the
casting
of
these
mirrors
is
a
very
delicate
operation
happily
some
years
before
a
of
the
de
l√©on
foucault
had
just
invented
means
by
which
the
polishing
of
became
very
prompt
and
easy
by
replacing
the
metallic
mirror
by
taking
a
piece
of
glass
the
size
required
and
plating
it
it
was
to
be
fixed
according
to
the
method
invented
by
herschel
for
telescopes
in
the
great
instrument
of
the
astronomer
at
slough
the
image
of
objects
reflected
by
the
mirror
inclined
at
the
bottom
of
the
tube
was
formed
at
the
other
extremity
where
the
eyeglass
was
placed
thus
the
observer
instead
of
being
placed
at
the
lower
end
of
the
tube
was
hoisted
to
the
upper
end
and
there
with
his
eyeglass
he
looked
down
into
the
enormous
cylinder
this
combination
had
the
advantage
of
doing
away
with
the
little
mirror
destined
to
send
back
the
image
to
the
ocular
glass
which
thus
only
reflected
once
instead
of
twice
therefore
there
were
fewer
luminous
rays
extinguished
the
image
was
less
feeble
and
more
light
was
obtained
a
precious
advantage
in
the
observation
that
was
to
be
made
this
being
resolved
upon
the
work
was
begun
according
to
the
calculations
of
the
cambridge
observatory
staff
the
tube
of
the
new
reflector
was
to
be
feet
long
and
its
mirror
feet
in
diameter
although
it
was
so
colossal
it
was
not
comparable
to
the
telescope
feet
long
which
the
astronomer
hooke
proposed
to
construct
some
years
ago
nevertheless
the
setting
up
of
such
an
apparatus
presented
great
difficulties
the
question
of
its
site
was
promptly
settled
it
must
be
upon
a
high
mountain
and
high
mountains
are
not
numerous
in
the
states
in
fact
the
orographical
system
of
this
great
country
only
contains
two
chains
of
average
height
amongst
which
flows
the
magnificent
mississippi
which
the
americans
would
call
the
king
of
rivers
if
they
admitted
any
royalty
whatever
on
the
east
rise
the
apalachians
the
very
highest
point
of
which
in
new
hampshire
does
not
exceed
the
very
moderate
altitude
of
feet
on
the
west
are
however
the
rocky
mountains
that
immense
chain
which
begins
at
the
straits
of
magellan
follows
the
west
coast
of
south
america
under
the
name
of
the
andes
or
cordilleras
crosses
the
isthmus
of
panama
and
runs
up
the
whole
of
north
america
to
the
very
shores
of
the
polar
sea
these
mountains
are
not
very
high
and
the
alps
or
himalayas
would
look
down
upon
them
with
disdain
in
fact
their
highest
summit
is
only
feet
high
whilst
mont
blanc
is
and
the
highest
summit
of
the
himalayas
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
but
as
the
gun
club
wished
that
its
telescope
as
well
as
the
columbiad
should
be
set
up
in
the
states
of
the
union
they
were
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
rocky
mountains
and
all
the
necessary
material
was
sent
to
the
summit
of
long
peak
in
the
territory
of
missouri
neither
pen
nor
language
could
relate
the
difficulties
of
every
kind
that
the
american
engineers
had
to
overcome
and
the
prodigies
of
audacity
and
skill
that
they
accomplished
enormous
stones
massive
pieces
of
heavy
and
huge
portions
of
cylinder
had
to
be
raised
with
an
weighing
nearly
above
the
line
of
perpetual
snow
for
more
than
feet
in
height
after
crossing
desert
prairies
impenetrable
forests
fearful
rapids
far
from
all
centres
of
population
and
in
the
midst
of
savage
regions
in
which
every
detail
of
life
becomes
an
insoluble
problem
and
nevertheless
american
genius
triumphed
over
all
these
obstacles
less
than
a
year
after
beginning
the
works
in
the
last
days
of
the
month
of
september
the
gigantic
reflector
rose
in
the
air
to
a
height
of
feet
it
was
hung
from
an
enormous
iron
scaffolding
an
ingenious
arrangement
allowed
it
to
be
easily
moved
towards
every
point
of
the
sky
and
to
follow
the
stars
from
one
horizon
to
the
other
during
their
journey
across
space
it
had
cost
more
than
dollars
the
first
time
it
was
pointed
at
the
moon
the
observers
felt
both
curious
and
uneasy
what
would
they
discover
in
the
field
of
this
telescope
which
magnified
objects
times
populations
flocks
of
lunar
animals
towns
lakes
and
oceans
no
nothing
that
science
was
not
already
acquainted
with
and
upon
all
points
of
her
disc
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
moon
could
be
determined
with
absolute
precision
but
the
telescope
of
the
rocky
mountains
before
being
used
by
the
gun
club
rendered
immense
services
to
astronomy
thanks
to
its
power
of
penetration
the
depths
of
the
sky
were
explored
to
their
utmost
limits
the
apparent
diameter
of
a
great
number
of
stars
could
be
rigorously
measured
and
clarke
of
the
cambridge
staff
resolved
the
crab

in
taurus
which
lord
rosse
reflector
had
never
been
able
to
do
chapter
xxv
final
details
it
was
the
of
november
the
supreme
departure
was
to
take
place
ten
days
later
one
operation
still
remained
to
bring
it
to
a
happy
termination
a
delicate
and
perilous
operation
exacting
infinite
precautions
and
against
the
success
of
which
captain
nicholl
had
laid
his
third
bet
it
was
in
fact
nothing
less
than
the
loading
of
the
gun
and
the
introduction
into
it
of
lbs
of
nicholl
had
thought
not
without
reason
perhaps
that
the
handling
of
so
large
a
quantity
of
pyroxyle
would
cause
grave
catastrophes
and
that
in
any
case
this
eminently
explosive
mass
would
ignite
of
itself
under
the
pressure
of
the
projectile
there
were
also
grave
dangers
increased
by
the
carelessness
of
the
americans
who
during
the
federal
war
used
to
load
their
cannon
cigar
in
mouth
but
barbicane
had
set
his
heart
on
succeeding
and
did
not
mean
to
founder
in
port
he
therefore
chose
his
best
workmen
made
them
work
under
his
superintendence
and
by
dint
of
prudence
and
precautions
he
managed
to
put
all
the
chances
of
success
on
his
side
first
he
took
care
not
to
bring
all
his
charge
at
once
to
the
inclosure
of
stony
hill
he
had
it
brought
little
by
little
carefully
packed
in
sealed
cases
the
lbs
of
pyroxyle
had
been
divided
into
packets
of
which
made
large
cartridges
made
carefully
by
the
cleverest
artisans
of
pensacola
each
case
contained
ten
and
they
arrived
one
after
the
other
by
the
railroad
of
tampa
town
by
that
means
there
were
never
more
than
lbs
of
pyroxyle
at
once
in
the
inclosure
as
soon
as
it
arrived
each
case
was
unloaded
by
workmen
walking
barefoot
and
each
cartridge
transported
to
the
orifice
of
the
columbiad
into
which
they
lowered
them
by
means
of
cranes
worked
by
the
men
every
had
been
excluded
and
the
least
fires
extinguished
for
two
miles
round
even
in
november
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
this
from
the
ardour
of
the
sun
so
they
worked
at
night
by
light
produced
in
a
vacuum
by
means
of
r√ºhmkorff
apparatus
which
threw
an
artificial
brightness
into
the
depths
of
the
columbiad
there
the
cartridges
were
arranged
with
the
utmost
regularity
fastened
together
by
a
wire
destined
to
communicate
the
electric
spark
to
them
all
simultaneously
in
fact
it
was
by
means
of
electricity
that
fire
was
to
be
set
to
this
mass
of
all
these
single
wires
surrounded
by
isolating
material
were
rolled
into
a
single
one
at
a
narrow
hole
pierced
at
the
height
the
projectile
was
to
be
placed
there
they
crossed
the
thick
metal
wall
and
came
up
to
the
surface
by
one
of
the
in
the
masonry
made
on
purpose
once
arrived
at
the
summit
of
stony
hill
the
wire
supported
on
poles
for
a
distance
of
two
miles
met
a
powerful
pile
of
bunsen
passing
through
a
apparatus
it
would
therefore
be
enough
to
press
with
the
finger
the
knob
of
the
apparatus
for
the
electric
current
to
be
at
once
established
and
to
set
fire
to
the
lbs
of
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
this
was
only
to
be
done
at
the
last
moment
on
the
of
november
the
cartridges
were
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
columbiad
that
part
of
the
operation
had
succeeded
but
what
worry
anxiety
and
struggles
president
barbicane
had
to
undergo
in
vain
had
he
forbidden
entrance
to
stony
hill
every
day
curious
sightseers
climbed
over
the
palisading
and
some
pushing
imprudence
to
folly
came
and
smoked
amongst
the
bales
of
barbicane
put
himself
into
daily
rages
maston
seconded
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
chasing
the
intruders
away
and
picking
up
the
which
the
yankees
threw
about
a
rude
task
for
more
than
people
pressed
round
the
palisades
michel
ardan
had
offered
himself
to
escort
the
cases
to
the
mouth
of
the
gun
but
having
caught
him
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
whilst
he
drove
out
the
intruders
to
whom
he
was
giving
this
unfortunate
example
the
president
of
the
gun
club
saw
that
he
could
not
depend
upon
this
intrepid
smoker
and
was
obliged
to
have
him
specially
watched
at
last
there
being
a
providence
even
for
artillerymen
nothing
blew
up
and
the
loading
was
happily
terminated
the
third
bet
of
captain
nicholl
was
therefore
much
imperilled
there
still
remained
the
work
of
introducing
the
projectile
into
the
columbiad
and
placing
it
on
the
thick
bed
of
but
before
beginning
this
operation
the
objects
necessary
for
the
journey
were
placed
with
order
in
the
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
and
if
they
had
allowed
michel
ardan
to
do
as
he
pleased
he
would
soon
have
filled
up
all
the
space
reserved
for
the
travellers
no
one
can
imagine
all
that
the
amiable
frenchman
wished
to
carry
to
the
moon
a
heap
of
useless
trifles
but
barbicane
interfered
and
refused
all
but
the
strictly
necessary
several
thermometers
barometers
and
telescopes
were
placed
in
the
the
travellers
were
desirous
of
examining
the
moon
during
their
transit
and
in
order
to
facilitate
the
survey
of
this
new
world
they
took
an
excellent
map
by
boeer
and
moedler
the
published
in
four
plates
which
is
justly
looked
upon
as
a
masterpiece
of
patience
and
observation
it
represented
with
scrupulous
exactitude
the
slightest
details
of
that
portion
of
the
moon
turned
towards
the
earth
mountains
valleys
craters
peaks
watersheds
were
depicted
on
it
in
their
exact
dimensions
faithful
positions
and
names
from
mounts
doerfel
and
leibnitz
whose
highest
summits
rise
on
the
eastern
side
of

the
north
polar
regions
it
was
therefore
a
precious
document
for
the
travellers
for
they
could
study
the
country
before
setting
foot
upon
it
they
took
also
three
rifles
and
three
with
powder
and
shot
in
great
quantity
we
do
not
know
with
whom
we
may
have
to
deal
said
michel
ardan
both
men
and
beasts
may
be
displeased
at
our
visit
we
must
therefore
take
our
precautions
the
instruments
of
personal
defence
were
accompanied
by
pickaxes
spades
saws
and
other
indispensable
tools
without
mentioning
garments
suitable
to
every
temperature
from
the
cold
of
the
polar
regions
to
the
heat
of
the
torrid
zone
michel
ardan
would
have
liked
to
take
a
certain
number
of
animals
of
different
sorts
not
male
and
female
of
every
species
as
he
did
not
see
the
necessity
of
acclimatising
serpents
tigers
alligators
or
any
other
noxious
beasts
in
the
moon
no
said
he
to
barbicane
but
some
useful
animals
ox
or
cow
ass
or
horse
would
look
well
in
the
landscape
and
be
of
great
use
i
agree
with
you
my
dear
ardan
answered
the
president
of
the
gun
club
but
our
projectile
is
not
noah
ark
it
differs
both
in
dimensions
and
object
so
let
us
remain
in
the
bounds
of
possibility
at
last
after
long
discussions
it
was
agreed
that
the
travellers
should
be
content
to
take
with
them
an
excellent
sporting
dog
belonging
to
nicholl
and
a
vigorous
newfoundland
of
prodigious
strength
several
cases
of
the
most
useful
seeds
were
included
amongst
the
indispensable
objects
if
they
had
allowed
him
michel
ardan
would
have
taken
several
sacks
of
earth
to
sow
them
in
any
way
he
took
a
dozen
little
trees
which
were
carefully
enveloped
in
straw
and
placed
in
a
corner
of
the
projectile
then
remained
the
important
question
of
provisions
for
they
were
obliged
to
provide
against
finding
the
moon
absolutely
barren
barbicane
managed
so
well
that
he
took
enough
for
a
year
but
it
must
be
added
to
prevent
astonishment
that
these
provisions
consisted
of
meat
and
vegetable
compressed
to
their
smallest
volume
by
hydraulic
pressure
and
included
a
great
quantity
of
nutritive
elements
there
was
not
much
variety
but
it
would
not
do
to
be
too
particular
in
such
an
expedition
there
was
also
about
fifty
gallons
of
brandy
and
water
for
two
months
only
for
according
to
the
latest
observations
of
astronomers
no
one
doubted
the
presence
of
a
large
quantity
of
water
in
the
moon
as
to
provisions
it
would
have
been
insane
to
believe
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
would
not
find
food
up
there
michel
ardan
had
no
doubt
about
it
if
he
had
he
would
not
have
gone
besides
said
he
one
day
to
his
friends
we
shall
not
be
completely
abandoned
by
our
friends
on
earth
and
they
will
take
care
not
to
forget
us
no
certainly
answered
maston
what
do
you
mean
asked
nicholl
nothing
more
simple
answered
ardan
will
not
our
columbiad
be
still
there
well
then
every
time
that
the
moon
is
in
favourable
conditions
of
zenith
if
not
of
perigee
that
is
to
say
about
once
a
year
could
they
not
send
us
a
projectile
loaded
with
provisions
which
we
should
expect
by
a
fixed
date
hurrah
cried
maston
that
is
not
at
all
a
bad
idea
certainly
we
will
not
forget
you
i
depend
upon
you
thus
you
see
we
shall
have
news
regularly
from
the
globe
and
for
our
part
we
shall
be
very
awkward
if
we
do
not
find
means
to
communicate
with
our
good
friends
on
earth
these
words
inspired
such
confidence
that
michel
ardan
with
his
superb
assurance
would
have
carried
the
whole
gun
club
with
him
what
he
said
seemed
simple
elementary
and
sure
of
success
and
it
would
have
been
sordid
attachment
to
this
earth
to
hesitate
to
follow
the
three
travellers
upon
their
lunar
expedition
when
the
different
objects
were
placed
in
the
projectile
the
water
was
introduced
between
the
partitions
and
the
gas
for
lighting
purposes
laid
in
barbicane
took
enough
chlorate
of
potash
and
caustic
potash
for
two
months
as
he
feared
unforeseen
delay
an
extremely
ingenious
machine
working
automatically
put
the
elements
for
good
air
in
motion
the
projectile
therefore
was
ready
and
the
only
thing
left
to
do
was
to
lower
it
into
the
gun
an
operation
full
of
perils
and
difficulty
the
enormous
projectile
was
taken
to
the
summit
of
stony
hill
there
enormous
cranes
seized
it
and
held
it
suspended
over
the
metal
well
this
was
an
anxious
moment
if
the
chains
were
to
break
under
the
enormous
weight
the
fall
of
such
a
mass
would
inevitably
ignite
the
happily
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
and
a
few
hours
afterwards
the
rested
on
its
pyroxyle
bed
a
veritable
fulminating
pillow
the
only
effect
of
its
pressure
was
to
ram
the
charge
of
the
gun
more
strongly
i
have
lost
said
the
captain
handing
the
sum
of
dollars
to
president
barbicane
barbicane
did
not
wish
to
receive
this
money
from
his
travelling
companion
but
he
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
nicholl
who
wished
to
fulfil
all
his
engagements
before
leaving
the
earth
then
said
michel
ardan
there
is
but
one
thing
i
wish
for
you
now
captain
what
is
that
asked
nicholl
it
is
that
you
may
lose
your
other
two
wagers
by
that
means
we
shall
be
sure
not
to
be
stopped
on
the
road

fire
the
of
december
came
the
fatal
day
for
if
the
projectile
did
not
start
that
very
evening
at
and
more
than
eighteen
years
would
elapse
before
the
moon
would
present
the
same
simultaneous
conditions
of
zenith
and
perigee
the
weather
was
magnificent
notwithstanding
the
approach
of
winter
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
bathed
in
its
radiance
that
earth
which
three
of
its
inhabitants
were
about
to
leave
for
a
new
world
how
many
people
slept
badly
during
the
night
that
preceded
the
day
how
many
breasts
were
oppressed
with
the
heavy
burden
of
waiting
all
hearts
beat
with
anxiety
except
only
the
heart
of
michel
ardan
this
impassible
person
went
and
came
in
his
usual
way
but
nothing
in
him
denoted
any
unusual
preoccupation
his
sleep
had
been
peaceful
it
was
the
sleep
of
turenne
upon
a
the
night
before
the
battle
from
early
dawn
an
innumerable
crowd
covered
the
prairie
which
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
round
stony
hill
every
quarter
of
an
hour
the
railroad
of
tampa
brought
fresh
sightseers
according
to
the
town
five
millions
of
spectators
were
that
day
upon
floridian
soil
the
greater
part
of
this
crowd
had
been
living
in
tents
round
the
inclosure
and
laid
the
foundations
of
a
town
which
has
since
been
called
ardan
town
the
ground
bristled
with
huts
cabins
and
tents
and
these
ephemeral
habitations
sheltered
a
population
numerous
enough
to
rival
the
largest
cities
of
europe
every
nation
upon
earth
was
represented
every
language
was
spoken
at
the
same
time
it
was
like
the
confusion
of
tongues
at
the
tower
of
babel
there
the
different
classes
of
american
society
mixed
in
absolute
equality
bankers
cultivators
sailors
agents
merchants
and
magistrates
elbowed
each
other
with
primitive
ease
the

of

fraternised
with
the
farmers
of

the

the

followed
preceded
and
surrounded
their
husbands
fathers
and
masters
who
resembled
the
patriarchs
amidst
their
innumerable
families
at
it
was
a
sight
to
see
all
these
people
devour
the
dishes
peculiar
to
the
southern
states
and
eat
with
an
appetite
menacing
to
the
provisioning
of
florida
the
food
that
would
be
repugnant
to
a
european
stomach
such
as
fricasseed
frogs
underdone
opossum
and
raccoon
steaks
the
liquors
that
accompanied
this
indigestible
food
were
numerous
shouts
and
vociferations
to

resounded
through
the

this

generally
these
sounds
addressed
to
throats
made
thirsty
by
the
spices
they
consumed
mingled
into
one
deafening
roar
but
on
this
of
december
these
cries
were
rare
no
one
thought
of
eating
and
drinking
and
at
there
were
many
spectators
in
the
crowd
who
had
not
taken
their
customary
lunch
a
much
more
significant
fact
even
the
national
passion
for
gaming
was
allayed
by
the
general
emotion
thimbles
skittles
and
cards
were
left
in
their
wrappings
and
testified
that
the
great
event
of
the
day
absorbed
all
attention
until
nightfall
a
dull
noiseless
agitation
like
that
which
precedes
great
catastrophes
ran
through
the
anxious
crowd
an
indescribable
uneasiness
oppressed
all
minds
and
stopped
the
beating
of
all
hearts
every
one
wished
it
over
however
about
seven
this
heavy
silence
was
suddenly
broken
the
moon
rose
above
the
horizon
several
millions
of
hurrahs
saluted
her
apparition
she
was
punctual
to
the
appointment
shouts
of
welcome
broke
from
all
parts
whilst
the
blonde
phoebe
shone
peacefully
in
a
clear
sky
and
caressed
the
enraptured
crowd
with
her
most
affectionate
rays
at
that
moment
the
three
intrepid
travellers
appeared
when
they
appeared
the
cries
redoubled
in
intensity
unanimously
instantaneously
the
national
song
of
the
united
states
escaped
from
all
the
spectators
and
yankee
doodle
sung
by
of
hearty
throats
rose
like
a
roaring
tempest
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
atmosphere
then
after
this
irresistible
outburst
the
hymn
was
ended
the
last
harmonies
died
away
by
degrees
and
a
silent
murmur
floated
over
the
crowd
in
the
meantime
the
frenchman
and
the
two
americans
had
stepped
into
the
inclosure
round
which
the
crowd
was
pressing

were
accompanied

had
found
under

an
ancient

the

freely
towards

nicholl
barbicane
and
michel
ardan
were
definitively
walled
up
in
their
metal

who
could
predict
the
universal
emotion
then
at
its
paroxysm
the

was
rising
in
a

limpid

outshining
on
her
passage
the
twinkling

she
passed
over
the
constellation
of
the

and
was
now
nearly
halfway
between
the
horizon
and
the
zenith
a
frightful
silence
hung
over
all
that
scene
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
on
the
earth
not
a
sound
of
breathing
from
the

every

was
fixed
on
the

of

murchison
watched
the

hardly
forty
seconds
had
to
elapse
before
the
moment
of
departure
struck
and
each
one
lasted
a
century
at
the
twentieth
there
was
a
universal
shudder
and
the
thought
occurred
to
all
the
crowd
that
the
audacious
travellers
shut
up
in
the

were
likewise
counting
these
terrible

some

murchison

pressed

a
fearful
superhuman
report
of
which
nothing
could
give
an
idea
not
even
thunder
or
the
eruption
of

was
immediately
produced
an
immense
spout
of

sprang
up
from

of
the
earth
as
if
from

heaved
and

for
an
incalculable
moment
day
was
substituted
for

over
a
considerable
extent
of

this
immense
column
of

was
perceived
for
a
hundred
miles
out
at
sea
from

from

than

noted

florida
was
shaken
to

the

expanded

forced
back
the

with
tremendous
violence
passing
like
a

through

not
one
spectator
remained
on
his

men
women
and
children
were
thrown
down
like
ears
of

in
a
storm
there
was
a
terrible
tumult
and
a
large
number
of
people
were
seriously
injured
maston

had
very
imprudently
kept
to

was
thrown
twenty

some
of
the

were
run
against
each
other
and
sunk
and
ten
of
them
were
stranded
high
and
dry
after
breaking
their
chains
like
threads
of
cotton

the
circle
of
these
devastations
extended
farther
still

the
recoil
aided
by
the
westerly
winds
was
felt
on
the

at
more
than
miles
from

an
unexpected
tempest
which
even

not

a
regrettable
catastrophe
which
was
the
object
of
lively
recriminations
lastly
although
the
fact
is
not
warranted
except
by
the
affirmation
of
a
few
natives
after
the
departure
of

the
inhabitants
of

that
they
heard

after

the

all

rose
and
shouted

sort
of
frenzy

several
millions
of
men
nose
in
air
armed
with
telescopes
and
every
species
of
looked
into
space
forgetting
contusions
and
feelings
in
order
to
look
at
the
projectile
but
they
sought
in
vain
it
was
not
to
be
seen
and
they
resolved
to
await
the
telegrams
from
long
peak
the
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
belfast
was
at
his
post
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
it
was
to
this
skilful
and
persevering
astronomer
that
the
observations
had
been
entrusted
but
an
unforeseen
phenomenon
against
which
nothing
could
be
done
soon
came
to
put
public
impatience
to
a
rude
test
the
weather
so
fine
before
suddenly
changed
the
sky
became
covered
with
clouds
it
could
not
be
otherwise
after
so
great
a
displacement
of
the
atmospheric
strata
and
the
dispersion
of
the
enormous
quantity
of
gases
from
the
combustion
of
lbs
of
pyroxyle
all
natural
order
had
been
disturbed
there
is
nothing
astonishing
in
that
for
in
it
has
been
noticed
that
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
has
been
suddenly
changed
by
the
artillery
discharge
the
next
day
the
sun
rose
upon
an
horizon
covered
with
thick
clouds
a
heavy
and
an
impenetrable
curtain
hung
between
earth
and
sky
and
which
unfortunately
extended
as
far
as
the
regions
of
the
rocky
mountains
it
was
a
fatality
a
concert
of
complaints
rose
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
but
nature
took
no
notice
and
as
men
had
chosen
to
disturb
the
atmosphere
with
their
gun
they
must
submit
to
the
consequences
during
this
first
day
every
one
tried
to
pierce
the
thick
veil
of
clouds
but
no
one
was
rewarded
for
the
trouble
besides
they
were
all
mistaken
in
supposing
they
could
see
it
by
looking
up
at
the
sky
for
on
account
of
the
diurnal
movement
of
the
globe
the
projectile
was
then
of
course
shooting
past
the
line
of
the
antipodes
however
that
might
be
when
night
again
enveloped
the
earth
a
dark
impenetrable
night
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
moon
above
the
horizon
it
might
have
been
thought
that
she
was
hiding
on
purpose
from
the
bold
beings
who
had
shot
at
her
no
observation
was
therefore
possible
and
the
despatches
from
long
peak
confirmed
the
disastrous
intelligence
however
if
the
experiment
had
succeeded
the
travellers
who
had
started
on
the
of
december
at
were
due
at
their
destination
on
the
at
midnight
so
that
as
up
to
that
time
it
would
after
all
have
been
difficult
to
observe
a
body
so
small
people
waited
with
all
the
patience
they
could
muster
on
the
of
december
from
till
midnight
it
would
have
been
possible
to
follow
the
trace
of
the
projectile
which
would
have
appeared
like
a
black
speck
on
the
shining
disc
of
the
moon
but
the
weather
remained
imperturbably
cloudy
and
exasperated
the
public
who
swore
at
the
moon
for
not
showing
herself
transit
gloria
maston
in
despair
set
out
for
long
peak
he
wished
to
make
an
observation
himself
he
did
not
doubt
that
his
friends
had
arrived
at
the
goal
of
their
journey
no
one
had
heard
that
the
projectile
had
fallen
upon
any
continent
or
island
upon
earth
and
maston
did
not
admit
for
a
moment
that
it
could
have
fallen
into
any
of
the
oceans
with
which
the
earth
is
three
parts
covered
on
the
the
same
weather
the
large
telescopes
of
the
old
world
those
of
herschel
rosse
and
foucault
were
invariably
fixed
upon
the
queen
of
night
for
the
weather
was
magnificent
in
europe
but
the
relative
weakness
of
these
instruments
prevented
any
useful
observation
on
the
the
same
weather
reigned
impatience
devoured
three
parts
of
the
globe
the
most
insane
means
were
proposed
for
dissipating
the
clouds
accumulated
in
the
air
on
the
the
sky
seemed
to
clear
a
little
hopes
revived
but
did
not
last
long
and
in
the
evening
thick
clouds
defended
the
starry
vault
against
all
eyes
things
now
became
grave
in
fact
on
the
at
the
moon
would
enter
her
last
quarter
after
this
delay
she
would
decline
every
day
and
even
if
the
sky
should
clear
the
chances
of
observation
would
be
considerably
lessened
in
fact
the
moon
would
then
show
only
a
portion
of
her
disc
and
would
end
by
becoming
new
that
is
to
say
she
would
rise
and
set
with
the
sun
whose
rays
would
make
her
quite
invisible
they
would
therefore
be
obliged
to
wait
till
the
of
january
at
till
she
would
be
full
again
and
ready
for
observation
the
newspapers
published
these
reflections
with
a
thousand
commentaries
and
did
not
fail
to
tell
the
public
that
it
must
arm
itself
with
angelic
patience
on
the
no
change
on
the
the
sun
appeared
for
a
moment
as
if
to
jeer
at
the
americans
it
was
received
with
hisses
and
wounded
doubtless
by
such
a
reception
it
was
very
miserly
of
its
rays
on
the
no
change
maston
nearly
went
mad
and
fears
were
entertained
for
his
brain
until
then
so
well
preserved
in
its
cranium
but
on
the
one
of
those
frightful
tempests
peculiar
to
tropical
regions
was
let
loose
in
the
atmosphere
terrific
east
winds
swept
away
the
clouds
which
had
been
so
long
there
and
in
the
evening
the
of
the
moon
rode
majestically
amidst
the
limpid
constellations
of
the
sky
chapter
xxviii
a
new
star
that
same
night
the
news
so
impatiently
expected
burst
like
a
thunderbolt
over
the
united
states
of
the
union
and
thence
darting
across
the
atlantic
it
ran
along
all
the
telegraphic
wires
of
the
globe
the
projectile
had
been
perceived
thanks
to
the
gigantic
reflector
of
long
peak
the
following
is
the
notice
drawn
up
by
the
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
it
resumes
the
scientific
conclusion
of
the
great
experiment
made
by
the
gun
club
long
peak
december
to
the
staff
of
the
cambridge
observatory
the
projectile
hurled
by
the
columbiad
of
stony
hill
was
perceived
by
belfast
and
maston
on
the
of
december
at
the
moon
having
entered
her
last
quarter
the
projectile
has
not
reached
its
goal
it
has
deviated
to
the
side
but
near
enough
to
be
detained
by
lunar
attraction
there
its
rectilinear
movement
changed
to
a
circular
one
of
extreme
velocity
and
it
has
been
drawn
round
the
moon
in
an
elliptical
orbit
and
has
become
her
satellite
we
have
not
yet
been
able
to
determine
the
elements
of
this
new
star
neither
its
speed
of
translation
or
rotation
is
known
the
distance
which
separates
it
from
the
surface
of
the
moon
may
be
estimated
at
about
miles
now
two
hypotheses
may
be
taken
into
consideration
as
to
a
modification
in
this
state
of
things
either
the
attraction
of
the
moon
will
end
by
drawing
it
towards
her
and
the
travellers
will
reach
the
goal
of
their
journey
or
the
projectile
maintained
in
an
immutable
orbit
will
gravitate
round
the
lunar
disc
till
the
end
of
time
observation
will
settle
this
point
some
day
but
until
now
the
experiment
of
the
gun
club
has
had
no
other
result
than
that
of
providing
our
solar
system
with
a
new
star
j

what
discussions
this
unexpected
gave
rise
to
what
a
situation
full
of
mystery
the
future
reserved
for
the
investigations
of
science
thanks
to
the
courage
and
devotion
of
three
men
this
enterprise
of
sending
a
bullet
to
the
moon
futile
enough
in
appearance
had
just
had
an
immense
result
the
consequences
of
which
are
incalculable
the
travellers
imprisoned
in
a
new
satellite
if
they
have
not
attained
their
end
form
at
least
part
of
the
lunar
world
they
gravitate
around
the
queen
of
night
and
for
the
first
time
human
eyes
can
penetrate
all
her
mysteries
the
names
of
nicholl
barbicane
and
michel
ardan
would
be
for
ever
celebrated
in
astronomical
annals
for
these
bold
explorers
desirous
of
widening
the
circle
of
human
knowledge
had
audaciously
rushed
into
space
and
had
risked
their
lives
in
the
strangest
experiment
of
modern
times
the
notice
from
long
peak
once
made
known
there
spread
throughout
the
universe
a
feeling
of
surprise
and
horror
was
it
possible
to
go
to
the
aid
of
these
bold
inhabitants
of
the
earth
certainly
not
for
they
had
put
themselves
outside
of
the
pale
of
humanity
by
crossing
the
limits
imposed
by
the
creator
on
his
terrestrial
creatures
they
could
procure
themselves
air
for
two
months
they
had
provisions
for
one
year
but
after
the
hardest
hearts
palpitated
at
this
terrible
question
one
man
alone
would
not
admit
that
the
situation
was
desperate
one
alone
had
confidence
and
it
was
their
friend
devoted
audacious
and
resolute
as
they
the
brave
maston
he
resolved
not
to
lose
sight
of
them
his
domicile
was
henceforth
the
post
of
long
peak
his
horizon
the
immense
reflector
as
soon
as
the
moon
rose
above
the
horizon
he
immediately
framed
her
in
the
field
of
his
telescope
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
her
for
an
instant
and
assiduously
followed
her
across
the
stellar
spaces
he
watched
with
eternal
patience
the
passage
of
the
projectile
over
her
disc
of
silver
and
in
reality
the
worthy
man
remained
in
perpetual
communication
with
his
three
friends
whom
he
did
not
despair
of
seeing
again
one
day
we
will
correspond
with
them
said
he
to
any
one
who
would
listen
as
soon
as
circumstances
will
allow
we
shall
have
news
from
them
and
they
will
have
news
from
us
besides
i
know
them
they
are
ingenious
men
those
three
carry
with
them
into

all
the
resources
of
art
science
and

those
everything
can
be
accomplished

preliminary
chapter
containing
a
short
account
of
the
first
part
of
this
work
to
serve
as
preface
to
the
second
during
the
course
of
the
year
the
entire
world
was
singularly
excited
by
a
scientific
experiment
without
precedent
in
the
annals
of
science
the
members
of
the
gun
club
a
circle
of
artillerymen
established
at
baltimore
after
the
american
war
had
the
idea
of
putting
themselves
in
communication
with
the
moon
yes
with
the
moon
by
sending
a
bullet
to
her
their
president
barbicane
the
promoter
of
the
enterprise
having
consulted
the
astronomers
of
the
cambridge
observatory
on
this
subject
took
all
the
precautions
necessary
for
the
success
of
the
extraordinary
enterprise
declared
practicable
by
the
majority
of
competent
people
after
having
solicited
a
public
subscription
which
produced
nearly
of
francs
it
began
its
gigantic
labours
according
to
the
plan
drawn
up
by
the
members
of
the
observatory
the
cannon
destined
to
hurl
the
projectile
was
to
be
set
up
in
some
country
situated
between
the
and
of
north
or
south
latitude
in
order
to
aim
at
the
moon
at
the
zenith
the
bullet
was
to
be
endowed
with
an
initial
velocity
of
yards
a
second
hurled
on
the
of
december
at
thirteen
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
to
eleven
in
the
evening
it
was
to
get
to
the
moon
four
days
after
its
departure
on
the
of
december
at
midnight
precisely
at
the
very
instant
she
would
be
at
her
perigee
that
is
to
say
nearest
to
the
earth
or
at
exactly
leagues
distance
the
principal
members
of
the
gun
club
the
president
barbicane
major
elphinstone
the
secretary
maston
and
other
held
several
meetings
in
which
the
form
and
composition
of
the
bullet
were
discussed
as
well
as
the
disposition
and
nature
of
the
cannon
and
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
powder
to
be
employed
it
was
decided
that
the
projectile
should
be
an
obus
of
aluminium
with
a
diameter
of
inches
its
sides
were
to
be
inches
thick
and
it
was
to
weigh
lbs
that
the
cannon
should
be
a
columbiad
feet
long
and
should
be
cast
at
once
in
the
ground
that
the
charge
should
consist
of
lbs
of
which
by
developing
litres
of
gas
under
the
projectile
would
carry
it
easily
towards
the
queen
of
night
these
questions
settled
president
barbicane
aided
by
the
engineer
murchison
chose
a
site
in
florida
in
north
lat
and
west
long
it
was
there
that
after
marvels
of
labour
the
columbiad
was
cast
quite
successfully
things
were
at
that
pass
when
an
incident
occurred
which
increased
the
interest
attached
to
this
great
enterprise
a
frenchman
a
regular
parisian
an
artist
as
witty
as
audacious
asked
leave
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
bullet
in
order
to
reach
the
moon
and
make
a
survey
of
the
terrestrial
satellite
this
intrepid
name
was
michel
ardan
he
arrived
in
america
was
received
with
enthusiasm
held
meetings
was
carried
in
triumph
reconciled
president
barbicane
to
his
mortal
enemy
captain
nicholl
and
in
pledge
of
the
reconciliation
he
persuaded
them
to
embark
with
him
in
the
projectile
the
proposition
was
accepted
the
form
of
the
bullet
was
changed
it
became
they
furnished
this
species
of
a√´rial
compartment
with
powerful
springs
and
breakable
partitions
to
break
the
departing
shock
it
was
filled
with
provisions
for
one
year
water
for
some
months
and
gas
for
some
days
an
automatic
apparatus
made
and
gave
out
the
air
necessary
for
the
respiration
of
the
three
travellers
at
the
same
time
the
gun
club
had
a
gigantic
telescope
set
up
on
one
of
the
highest
summits
of
the
rocky
mountains
through
which
the
projectile
could
be
followed
during
its
journey
through
space
everything
was
then
ready
on
the
of
november
at
the
time
fixed
amidst
an
extraordinary
concourse
of
spectators
the
departure
took
place
and
for
the
first
time
three
human
beings
left
the
terrestrial
globe
for
the
interplanetary
regions
with
almost
the
certainty
of
reaching
their
goal
these
audacious
travellers
michel
ardan
president
barbicane
and
captain
nicholl
were
to
accomplish
their
journey
in
hours
thirteen
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
consequently
they
could
not
reach
the
lunar
disc
until
the
of
december
at
midnight
at
the
precise
moment
that
the
moon
would
be
full
and
not
on
the
as
some
newspapers
had
given
out
but
an
unexpected
circumstance
occurred
the
detonation
produced
by
the
columbiad
had
the
immediate
effect
of
disturbing
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
where
an
enormous
quantity
of
vapour
accumulated
this
phenomenon
excited
general
indignation
for
the
moon
was
hidden
during
several
nights
from
the
eyes
of
her
contemplators
the
worthy
maston
the
greatest
friend
of
the
three
travellers
set
out
for
the
rocky
mountains
in
the
company
of
the
honourable
belfast
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
and
reached
the
station
of
peak
where
the
telescope
was
set
up
which
brought
the
moon
apparently
to
within
two
leagues
the
honourable
secretary
of
the
gun
club
wished
to
observe
for
himself
the
vehicle
that
contained
his
audacious
friends
the
accumulation
of
clouds
in
the
atmosphere
prevented
all
observation
during
the
and
of
december
it
was
even
thought
that
no
observation
could
take
place
before
the
of
january
in
the
following
year
for
the
moon
entering
her
last
quarter
on
the
would
after
that
not
show
enough
of
her
surface
to
allow
the
trace
of
the
projectile
to
be
followed
but
at
last
to
the
general
satisfaction
a
strong
tempest
during
the
night
between
the
and
of
december
cleared
the
atmosphere
and
the
was
distinctly
visible
on
the
dark
background
of
the
sky
that
same
night
a
telegram
was
sent
from
long
peak
station
by
maston
and
belfast
to
the
staff
of
the
cambridge
observatory
this
telegram
announced
that
on
the
of
december
at
the
projectile
hurled
by
the
columbiad
of
stony
hill
had
been
perceived
by
belfast
and
maston
that
the
bullet
had
deviated
from
its
course
through
some
unknown
cause
and
had
not
reached
its
goal
but
had
gone
near
enough
to
be
retained
by
lunar
attraction
that
its
rectilinear
movement
had
been
changed
to
a
circular
one
and
that
it
was
describing
an
elliptical
orbit
round
the
moon
and
had
become
her
satellite
the
telegram
added
that
the
elements
of
this
new
star
had
not
yet
been
calculated
in
fact
three
observations
taking
a
star
in
three
different
positions
are
necessary
to
determine
them
then
it
stated
that
the
distance
separating
the
projectile
from
the
lunar
surface
might
be
estimated
at
about
leagues
or
miles
it
ended
with
the
following
double
hypothesis
either
the
attraction
of
the
moon
would
end
by
carrying
the
day
and
the
travellers
would
reach
their
goal
or
the
projectile
fixed
in
an
immutable
orbit
would
gravitate
around
the
lunar
disc
to
the
end
of
time
in
either
of
these
alternatives
what
would
be
the
travellers
fate
it
is
true
they
had
provisions
enough
for
some
time
but
even
supposing
that
their
bold
enterprise
were
crowned
with
success
how
would
they
return
could
they
ever
return
would
news
of
them
ever
reach
the
earth
these
questions
debated
upon
by
the
most
learned
writers
of
the
time
intensely
interested
the
public
a
remark
may
here
be
made
which
ought
to
be
meditated
upon
by
too
impatient
observers
when
a
announces
a
purely
speculative
discovery
to
the
public
he
can
not
act
with
too
much
prudence
no
one
is
obliged
to
discover
either
a
comet
or
a
satellite
and
those
who
make
a
mistake
in
such
a
case
expose
themselves
justly
to
public
ridicule
therefore
it
is
better
to
wait
and
that
is
what
impatient
maston
ought
to
have
done
before
sending
to
the
world
the
telegram
which
according
to
him
contained
the
last
communication
about
this
enterprise
in
fact
the
telegram
contained
errors
of
two
sorts
verified
later
errors
of
observation
concerning
the
distance
of
the
projectile
from
the
surface
of
the
moon
for
upon
the
date
of
the
of
december
it
was
impossible
to
perceive
it
and
that
which
maston
had
seen
or
thought
he
saw
could
not
be
the
bullet
from
the
columbiad
a
theoretic
error
as
to
the
fate
of
the
said
projectile
for
making
it
a
satellite
of
the
moon
was
an
absolute
contradiction
of
the
laws
of
rational
mechanics
one
hypothesis
only
made
by
the
astronomers
of
long
peak
might
be
realised
the
one
that
foresaw
the
case
when
the
travellers
if
any
yet
existed
should
unite
their
efforts
with
the
lunar
attraction
so
as
to
reach
the
surface
of
the
disc
now
these
men
as
intelligent
as
they
were
bold
had
survived
the
terrible
shock
at
departure
and
their
journey
in
their
will
be
related
in
its
most
dramatic
as
well
as
in
its
most
singular
details
this
account
will
put
an
end
to
many
illusions
and
previsions
but
it
will
give
a
just
idea
of
the
various
circumstances
incidental
to
such
an
enterprise
and
will
set
in
relief
barbicane
scientific
instincts
nicholl
industrial
resources
and
the
humorous
audacity
of
michel
ardan
besides
it
will
prove
that
their
worthy
friend
maston
was
losing
his
time
when
bending
over
the
gigantic
telescope
he
watched
the
course
of
the
moon
across
the
planetary
regions
chapter
i
from
to
when
ten
struck
michel
ardan
barbicane
and
nicholl
said
to
the
numerous
friends
they
left
upon
the
earth
the
two
dogs
destined
to
acclimatise
the
canine
race
upon
the
lunar
continents
were
already
imprisoned
in
the
projectile
the
three
travellers
approached
the
orifice
of
the
enormous
iron
tube
and
a
crane
lowered
them
to
the
conical
covering
of
the
bullet
there
an
opening
made
on
purpose
let
them
down
into
the
aluminium
vehicle
the
crane
tackling
was
drawn
up
outside
and
the
mouth
of
the
columbiad
instantly
cleared
of
its
last
scaffolding
as
soon
as
nicholl
and
his
companions
were
in
the
projectile
he
closed
the
opening
by
means
of
a
strong
plate
screwed
down
inside
other
plates
covered
the
lenticular
glasses
of
the
skylights
the
travellers
hermetically
inclosed
in
their
metal
prison
were
in
profound
darkness
and
now
my
dear
companions
said
michel
ardan
let
us
make
ourselves
at
home
i
am
a
domestic
man
myself
and
know
how
to
make
the
best
of
any
lodgings
first
let
us
have
a
light
gas
was
not
invented
for
moles
saying
which
the
fellow
struck
a
match
on
the
sole
of
his
boot
and
then
applied
it
to
the
burner
of
the
receptacle
in
which
there
was
enough
carbonised
hydrogen
stored
under
strong
pressure
for
lighting
and
heating
the
bullet
for
hours
or
six
days
and
six
nights
once
the
gas
lighted
the
projectile
presented
the
aspect
of
a
comfortable
room
with
padded
walls
furnished
with
circular
divans
the
roof
of
which
was
in
the
shape
of
a
dome
the
objects
in
it
weapons
instruments
and
utensils
were
solidly
fastened
to
the
sides
in
order
to
bear
the
parting
shock
with
impunity
every
possible
precaution
had
been
taken
to
insure
the
success
of
so
bold
an
experiment
michel
ardan
examined
everything
and
declared
himself
quite
satisfied
with
his
quarters
it
is
a
prison
said
he
but
a
travelling
prison
and
if
i
had
the
right
to
put
my
nose
to
the
window
i
would
take
it
on
a
hundred
lease
you
are
smiling
barbicane
you
are
thinking
of
something
you
do
not
communicate
do
you
say
to
yourself
that
this
prison
may
be
our
coffin
our
coffin
let
it
be
i
would
not
change
it
for
mahomet
which
only
hangs
in
space
and
does
not
move
whilst
michel
ardan
was
talking
thus
barbicane
and
nicholl
were
making
their
last
preparations
it
was
by
nicholl
chronometer
when
the
three
travellers
were
definitely
walled
up
in
their
bullet
this
chronometer
was
regulated
to
the
tenth
of
a
second
by
that
of
the
engineer
murchison
barbicane
looked
at
it
my
friends
said
he
it
is
twenty
minutes
past
ten
at
thirteen
minutes
to
eleven
murchison
will
set
fire
to
the
columbiad
at
that
minute
precisely
we
shall
leave
our
spheroid
we
have
therefore
still
minutes
to
remain
upon
earth
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
answered
the
methodical
nicholl
very
well
cried
michel
ardan
in
minutes
lots
of
things
can
be
done
we
can
discuss
grave
moral
or
political
questions
and
even
solve
them
minutes
well
employed
are
worth
more
than
years
of
doing
nothing
a
few
seconds
of
a
pascal
or
a
newton
are
more
precious
than
the
whole
existence
of
a
crowd
of
imbeciles
and
what
do
you
conclude
from
that
talker
eternal
asked
president
barbicane
i
conclude
that
we
have
minutes
answered
ardan
only
said
nicholl
then
if
you
like
brave
captain
answered
ardan
minutes
during
which
we
might
investigate
michel
said
barbicane
during
our
journey
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
investigate
the
deepest
questions
now
we
must
think
of
starting
are
we
not
ready
certainly
but
there
are
still
some
precautions
to
be
taken
to
deaden
the
first
shock
as
much
as
possible
have
we
not
placed
between
movable
partitions
elastic
enough
to
protect
us
sufficiently
i
hope
so
michel
answered
barbicane
gently
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
ah
the
joker
exclaimed
michel
ardan
he
hopes
he
is
not
quite
sure
and
he
waits
till
we
are
encased
to
make
this
deplorable
acknowledgment
i
ask
to
get
out
by
what
means
asked
barbicane
well
said
michel
ardan
it
would
be
difficult
we
are
in
the
train
and
the
guard
whistle
will
be
heard
in
minutes
twenty
ejaculated
nicholl
the
three
travellers
looked
at
one
another
for
a
few
seconds
then
they
examined
all
the
objects
imprisoned
with
them
everything
is
in
its
place
said
barbicane
the
question
now
is
where
we
can
place
ourselves
so
as
best
to
support
the
departing
shock
the
position
we
assume
must
be
important
too
we
must
prevent
the
blood
rushing
too
violently
to
our
heads
that
is
true
said
nicholl
then
answered
michel
ardan
always
ready
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
we
will
stand
on
our
heads
like
the
clowns
at
the
circus
no
said
barbicane
but
let
us
lie
on
our
sides
we
shall
thus
resist
the
shock
better
when
the
bullet
starts
it
will
not
much
matter
whether
we
are
inside
or
in
front
if
it
comes
to
much
matter
i
am
more
reassured
answered
michel
ardan
do
you
approve
of
my
idea
nicholl
asked
barbicane
entirely
answered
the
captain
still
thirteen
minutes
and
nicholl
is
not
a
man
exclaimed
michel
he
is
a
chronometer
marking
the
seconds
and
with
eight
holes
in
but
his
companions
were
no
longer
listening
to
him
and
they
were
making
their
last
preparations
with
all
the
coolness
imaginable
they
looked
like
two
methodical
travellers
taking
their
places
in
the
train
and
making
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
one
wonders
indeed
of
what
materials
these
american
hearts
are
made
to
which
the
approach
of
the
most
frightful
danger
does
not
add
a
single
pulsation
three
beds
thick
and
solidly
made
had
been
placed
in
the
projectile
nicholl
and
barbicane
placed
them
in
the
centre
of
the
disc
that
formed
the
movable
flooring
there
the
three
travellers
were
to
lie
down
a
few
minutes
before
their
departure
in
the
meanwhile
ardan
who
could
not
remain
quiet
turned
round
his
narrow
prison
like
a
wild
animal
in
a
cage
talking
to
his
friends
and
his
dogs
diana
and
satellite
to
whom
it
will
be
noticed
he
had
some
time
before
given
these
significant
names
up
diana
up
satellite
cried
he
exciting
them
you
are
going
to
show
to
the
selenite
dogs
how
the
dogs
of
the
earth
can
be
that
will
do
honour
to
the
canine
race
if
we
ever
come
back
here
i
will
bring
back
a
of
that
will
become
all
the
rage
if
there
are
any
dogs
in
the
moon
said
barbicane
there
are
some
affirmed
michel
ardan
the
same
as
there
are
horses
cows
asses
and
hens
i
wager
anything
we
shall
find
some
hens
i
bet
a
hundred
dollars
we
find
none
said
nicholl
done
captain
answered
ardan
shaking
hands
with
nicholl
but
you
have
lost
three
bets
with
the
president
for
the
funds
necessary
for
the
enterprise
were
provided
the
casting
succeeded
and
lastly
the
columbiad
was
loaded
without
accident
that
makes
six
thousand
dollars
yes
answered
nicholl
minutes
and
six
seconds
to
eleven
i
hear
captain
well
before
another
quarter
of
an
hour
is
over
you
will
have
to
make
over
another
nine
thousand
dollars
to
the
president
four
thousand
because
the
columbiad
will
not
burst
and
five
thousand
because
the
bullet
will
rise
higher
than
six
miles
into
the
air
i
have
the
dollars
answered
nicholl
striking
his
coat
pocket
and
i
only
want
to
pay
come
nicholl
i
see
you
are
a
man
of
order
what
i
never
could
be
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
your
series
of
bets
can
not
be
very
advantageous
to
you
why
asked
barbicane
because
if
you
win
the
first
the
columbiad
will
have
burst
and
the
bullet
with
it
and
barbicane
will
not
be
there
to
pay
you
your
dollars
my
wager
is
deposited
in
the
baltimore
bank
answered
barbicane
simply
and
in
default
of
nicholl
it
will
go
to
his
heirs
what
practical
men
you
are
cried
michel
ardan
i
admire
you
as
much
as
i
do
not
understand
you
eighteen
minutes
to
eleven
said
nicholl
only
five
minutes
more
answered
barbicane
yes
five
short
minutes
replied
michel
ardan
and
we
are
shut
up
in
a
bullet
at
the
bottom
of
a
cannon
feet
long
and
under
this
bullet
there
are
lbs
of
worth
more
than
lbs
of
ordinary
powder
and
friend
murchison
with
his
chronometer
in
hand
and
his
eye
fixed
on
the
hand
and
his
finger
on
the
electric
knob
is
counting
the
seconds
to
hurl
us
into
the
planetary
regions
enough
michel
enough
said
barbicane
in
a
grave
tone
let
us
prepare
ourselves
a
few
seconds
only
separate
us
from
a
supreme
moment
your
hands
my
friends
yes
cried
michel
ardan
more
moved
than
he
wished
to
appear
the
three
bold
companions
shook
hands
god
help
us
said
the
religious
president
michel
ardan
and
nicholl
lay
down
on
their
beds
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
thirteen
minutes
to
eleven
murmured
the
captain
twenty
seconds
more
barbicane
rapidly
put
out
the
gas
and
lay
down
beside
his
companions
the
profound
silence
was
only
broken
by
the
chronometer
beating
the
seconds
suddenly
a
frightful
shock
was
felt
and
the
projectile
under
the
impulsion
of
litres
of
gas
developed
by
the
deflagration
of
the
pyroxyle
rose
into
space
chapter
ii
the
first
what
had
happened
what
was
the
effect
of
the
frightful
shock
had
the
ingenuity
of
the
constructors
of
the
projectile
been
attended
by
a
happy
result
was
the
effect
of
the
shock
deadened
thanks
to
the
springs
the
four
buffers
the
and
the
movable
partitions
had
they
triumphed
over
the
frightful
impulsion
of
the
initial
velocity
of
metres
a
second
this
was
evidently
the
question
the
thousands
of
witnesses
of
the
exciting
scene
asked
themselves
they
forgot
the
object
of
the
journey
and
only
thought
of
the
travellers
suppose
one
of
them
maston
for
instance
had
been
able
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
projectile
what
would
he
have
seen
nothing
then
the
obscurity
was
profound
in
the
bullet
its
sides
had
resisted
perfectly
there
was
not
a
break
a
crack
or
a
dint
in
them
the
admirable
projectile
was
not
hurt
by
the
intense
deflagration
of
the
powders
instead
of
being
liquefied
as
it
was
feared
into
a
shower
of
aluminium
in
the
interior
there
was
very
little
disorder
on
the
whole
a
few
objects
had
been
violently
hurled
up
to
the
roof
but
the
most
important
did
not
seem
to
have
suffered
from
the
shock
their
fastenings
were
intact
on
the
movable
disc
crushed
down
to
the
bottom
by
the
smashing
of
the
partitions
and
the
escape
of
the
water
three
bodies
lay
motionless
did
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
still
breathe
was
the
projectile
nothing
but
a
metal
coffin
carrying
three
corpses
into
space
a
few
minutes
after
the
departure
of
the
bullet
one
of
these
bodies
moved
stretched
out
its
arms
lifted
up
its
head
and
succeeded
in
getting
upon
its
knees
it
was
michel
ardan
he
felt
himself
uttered
a
sonorous
hum
then
said
michel
ardan
complete
now
for
the
others
the
courageous
frenchman
wanted
to
get
up
but
he
could
not
stand
his
head
vacillated
his
blood
violently
sent
up
to
his
head
blinded
him
he
felt
like
a
drunken
man
brrr
said
he
i
feel
as
though
i
had
been
drinking
two
bottles
of
corton
only
that
was
not
so
agreeable
to
swallow
then
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
several
times
and
rubbing
his
temples
he
called
out
in
a
firm
voice
nicholl
barbicane
he
waited
anxiously
no
answer
not
even
a
sigh
to
indicate
that
the
hearts
of
his
companions
still
beat
he
reiterated
his
call
same
silence
the
devil
said
he
they
seem
as
though
they
had
fallen
from
the
fifth
story
upon
their
heads
bah
he
added
with
the
imperturbable
confidence
that
nothing
could
shake
if
a
frenchman
can
get
upon
his
knees
two
americans
will
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
upon
their
feet
but
first
of
all
let
us
have
a
light
on
the
subject
ardan
felt
life
come
back
to
him
in
streams
his
blood
became
calm
and
resumed
its
ordinary
circulation
fresh
efforts
restored
his
equilibrium
he
succeeded
in
getting
up
took
a
match
out
of
his
pocket
and
struck
it
then
putting
it
to
the
burner
he
lighted
the
gas
the
meter
was
not
in
the
least
damaged
the
gas
had
not
escaped
besides
the
smell
would
have
betrayed
it
and
had
this
been
the
case
michel
ardan
could
not
with
impunity
have
lighted
a
match
in
a
medium
filled
with
hydrogen
the
gas
mixed
in
the
air
would
have
produced
a
detonating
mixture
and
an
explosion
would
have
finished
what
a
shock
had
perhaps
begun
as
soon
as
the
gas
was
lighted
ardan
bent
down
over
his
two
companions
their
bodies
were
thrown
one
upon
the
other
nicholl
on
the
top
barbicane
underneath
ardan
raised
the
captain
propped
him
up
against
a
divan
and
rubbed
him
vigorously
this
friction
administered
skilfully
reanimated
nicholl
who
opened
his
eyes
instantly
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
seized
ardan
hand
and
then
looking
round
him
and
barbicane
he
asked
each
in
turn
answered
michel
ardan
tranquilly
i
began
with
you
nicholl
because
you
were
on
the
top
now
i
go
to
barbicane
that
said
ardan
and
nicholl
raised
the
president
of
the
gun
club
and
put
him
on
a
divan
barbicane
seemed
to
have
suffered
more
than
his
companions
he
was
bleeding
but
nicholl
was
glad
to
find
that
the
hemorrhage
only
came
from
a
slight
wound
in
his
shoulder
it
was
a
simple
scratch
which
he
carefully
closed
nevertheless
barbicane
was
some
time
before
he
came
to
himself
which
frightened
his
two
friends
who
did
not
spare
their
friction
he
is
breathing
however
said
nicholl
putting
his
ear
to
the
breast
of
the
wounded
man
yes
answered
ardan
he
is
breathing
like
a
man
who
is
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
daily
rub
nicholl
rub
with
all
your
might
and
the
two
improvised
practitioners
set
to
work
with
such
a
will
and
managed
so
well
that
barbicane
at
last
came
to
his
senses
he
opened
his
eyes
sat
up
took
the
hands
of
his
two
friends
and
his
first
words
were
nicholl
are
we
going
on
nicholl
and
ardan
looked
at
one
another
they
had
not
yet
thought
about
the
projectile
their
first
anxiety
had
been
for
the
travellers
not
for
the
vehicle
well
really
are
we
going
on
repeated
michel
ardan
or
are
we
tranquilly
resting
on
the
soil
of
florida
asked
nicholl
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
added
michel
ardan
impossible
cried
president
barbicane
this
double
hypothesis
suggested
by
his
two
friends
immediately
recalled
him
to
life
and
energy
they
could
not
yet
decide
the
question
the
apparent
immovability
of
the
bullet
and
the
want
of
communication
with
the
exterior
prevented
them
finding
it
out
perhaps
the
projectile
was
falling
through
space
perhaps
after
rising
a
short
distance
it
had
fallen
upon
the
earth
or
even
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
a
fall
which
the
narrowness
of
the
floridian
peninsula
rendered
possible
the
case
was
grave
the
problem
interesting
it
was
necessary
to
solve
it
as
soon
as
possible
barbicane
excited
and
by
his
moral
energy
triumphing
over
his
physical
weakness
stood
up
and
listened
a
profound
silence
reigned
outside
but
the
thick
padding
was
sufficient
to
shut
out
all
the
noises
on
earth
however
one
circumstance
struck
barbicane
the
temperature
in
the
interior
of
the
projectile
was
singularly
high
the
president
drew
out
a
thermometer
from
the
envelope
that
protected
it
and
consulted
it
the
instrument
showed
fahr
yes
he
then
exclaimed
yes
we
are
moving
this
stifling
heat
oozes
through
the
sides
of
our
projectile
it
is
produced
by
friction
against
the
atmosphere
it
will
soon
diminish
because
we
are
already
moving
in
space
and
after
being
almost
suffocated
we
shall
endure
intense
cold
what
asked
michel
ardan
do
you
mean
to
say
that
we
are
already
beyond
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
without
the
slightest
doubt
michel
listen
to
me
it
now
wants
but
five
minutes
to
eleven
it
is
already
eight
minutes
since
we
started
now
if
our
initial
velocity
has
not
been
diminished
by
friction
six
seconds
would
be
enough
for
us
to
pass
the
sixteen
leagues
of
atmosphere
which
surround
our
spheroid
just
so
answered
nicholl
but
in
what
proportion
do
you
reckon
the
diminution
of
speed
by
friction
in
the
proportion
of
answered
barbicane
this
diminution
is
considerable
but
it
is
so
much
according
to
my
calculations
if
therefore
we
have
had
an
initial
velocity
of
metres
when
we
get
past
the
atmosphere
it
will
be
reduced
to
metres
however
that
may
be
we
have
already
cleared
that
space
and
and
then
said
michel
ardan
friend
nicholl
has
lost
his
two
bets
four
thousand
dollars
because
the
columbiad
has
not
burst
five
thousand
dollars
because
the
projectile
has
risen
to
a
greater
height
than
six
miles
therefore
nicholl
shell
out
we
must
prove
it
first
answered
the
captain
and
pay
afterwards
it
is
quite
possible
that
barbicane
calculations
are
exact
and
that
i
have
lost
my
nine
thousand
dollars
but
another
hypothesis
has
come
into
my
mind
and
it
may
cancel
the
wager
what
is
that
asked
barbicane
quickly
the
supposition
that
for
some
reason
or
other
the
powder
did
not
catch
fire
and
we
have
not
started
good
heavens
captain
cried
michel
ardan
that
is
a
supposition
worthy
of
me
it
is
not
serious
have
we
not
been
half
stunned
by
the
shock
did
i
not
bring
you
back
to
life
does
not
the
shoulder
still
bleed
from
the
blow
agreed
michel
replied
nicholl
but
allow
me
to
ask
one
question
ask
it
captain
did
you
hear
the
detonation
which
must
certainly
have
been
formidable
no
answered
ardan
much
surprised
i
certainly
did
not
hear
it
and
you
barbicane
i
did
not
either
what
do
you
make
of
that
asked
nicholl
what
indeed
murmured
the
president
why
did
we
not
hear
the
detonation
the
three
friends
looked
at
one
another
rather
disconcertedly
here
was
an
inexplicable
phenomenon
the
projectile
had
been
fired
however
and
there
must
have
been
a
detonation
we
must
know
first
where
we
are
said
barbicane
so
let
us
open
the
panel
this
simple
operation
was
immediately
accomplished
the
screws
that
fastened
the
bolts
on
the
outer
plates
of
the
skylight
yielded
to
the
these
bolts
were
driven
outside
and
obturators
wadded
with
indiarubber
corked
up
the
hole
that
let
them
through
the
exterior
plate
immediately
fell
back
upon
its
hinges
like
a
and
the
lenticular
glass
that
covered
the
hole
appeared
an
identical
had
been
made
in
the
other
side
of
the
projectile
another
in
the
dome
and
a
fourth
in
the
bottom
the
firmament
could
therefore
be
observed
in
four
opposite
directions
the
firmament
through
the
lateral
windows
and
the
earth
or
the
moon
more
directly
through
the
upper
or
lower
opening
of
the
bullet
barbicane
and
his
companions
immediately
rushed
to
the
uncovered
no
ray
of
light
illuminated
it
profound
darkness
surrounded
the
projectile
this
darkness
did
not
prevent
barbicane
exclaiming
no
my
friends
we
have
not
fallen
on
the
earth
again
no
we
are
not
immersed
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
yes
we
are
going
up
through
space
look
at
those
stars
that
are
shining
in
the
darkness
and
the
impenetrable
darkness
that
lies
between
the
earth
and
us
hurrah
hurrah
cried
michel
ardan
and
nicholl
with
one
voice
in
fact
the
thick
darkness
proved
that
the
projectile
had
left
the
earth
for
the
ground
then
brilliantly
lighted
by
the
moon
would
have
appeared
before
the
eyes
of
the
travellers
if
they
had
been
resting
upon
it
this
darkness
proved
also
that
the
projectile
had
passed
beyond
the
atmosphere
for
the
diffused
light
in
the
air
would
have
been
reflected
on
the
metallic
sides
of
the
projectile
which
reflection
was
also
wanting
this
light
would
have
shone
upon
the
glass
of
the
and
that
glass
was
in
darkness
doubt
was
no
longer
possible
the
travellers
had
quitted
the
earth
i
have
lost
said
nicholl
i
congratulate
you
upon
it
answered
ardan
here
are
nine
thousand
dollars
said
the
captain
taking
a
bundle
of
notes
out
of
his
pocket
will
you
have
a
receipt
asked
barbicane
as
he
took
the
money
if
you
do
not
mind
answered
nicholl
it
is
more
regular
and
as
seriously
and
phlegmatically
as
if
he
had
been
in
his
president
barbicane
drew
out
his
and
tore
out
a
clear
page
wrote
a
receipt
in
pencil
dated
it
signed
it
and
gave
it
to
the
captain
who
put
it
carefully
into
his
michel
ardan
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
to
his
two
companions
without
speaking
a
word
such
formality
under
such
circumstances
took
away
his
power
of
speech
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
american
once
their
business
over
barbicane
and
nicholl
went
back
to
the
and
looked
at
the
constellations
the
stars
stood
out
clearly
upon
the
dark
background
of
the
sky
but
from
this
side
the
moon
could
not
be
seen
as
she
moves
from
east
to
west
rising
gradually
to
the
zenith
her
absence
made
ardan
say
and
the
moon
is
she
going
to
fail
us
do
not
frighten
yourself
answered
barbicane
our
spheroid
is
at
her
post
but
we
can
not
see
her
from
this
side
we
must
open
the
opposite
at
the
very
moment
when
barbicane
was
going
to
abandon
one
window
to
set
clear
the
opposite
one
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
approach
of
a
shining
object
it
was
an
enormous
disc
the
colossal
dimensions
of
which
could
not
be
estimated
its
face
turned
towards
the
earth
was
brilliantly
lighted
it
looked
like
a
small
moon
reflecting
the
light
of
the
large
one
it
advanced
at
prodigious
speed
and
seemed
to
describe
round
the
earth
an
orbit
right
across
the
passage
of
the
projectile
to
the
movement
of
translation
of
this
object
was
added
a
movement
of
rotation
upon
itself
it
was
therefore
behaving
like
all
celestial
bodies
abandoned
in
space
eh
cried
michel
ardan
whatever
is
that
another
projectile
barbicane
did
not
answer
the
apparition
of
this
enormous
body
surprised
him
and
made
him
uneasy
a
collision
was
possible
which
would
have
had
deplorable
results
either
by
making
the
projectile
deviate
from
its
route
and
fall
back
upon
the
earth
or
be
caught
up
by
the
attractive
power
of
the
asteroid
president
barbicane
had
rapidly
seized
the
consequences
of
these
three
hypotheses
which
in
one
way
or
other
would
fatally
prevent
the
success
of
his
attempt
his
companions
were
silently
watching
the
object
which
grew
prodigiously
larger
as
it
approached
and
through
a
certain
optical
illusion
it
seemed
as
if
the
projectile
were
rushing
upon
it
ye
gods
cried
michel
ardan
there
will
be
a
collision
on
the
line
the
three
travellers
instinctively
drew
back
their
terror
was
extreme
but
it
did
not
last
long
hardly
a
few
seconds
the
asteroid
passed
at
a
distance
of
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
projectile
and
disappeared
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
rapidity
of
its
course
but
because
its
side
opposite
to
the
moon
was
suddenly
confounded
with
the
absolute
darkness
of
space
a
good
journey
to
you
cried
michel
ardan
uttering
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
is
not
infinitude
large
enough
to
allow
a
poor
little
bullet
to
go
about
without
fear
what
was
that
pretentious
globe
which
nearly
knocked
against
us
i
know
answered
barbicane
of
course
you
know
everything
it
is
a
simple
asteroid
said
barbicane
but
so
large
that
the
attraction
of
the
earth
has
kept
it
in
the
state
of
a
satellite
is
it
possible
exclaimed
michel
ardan
then
the
earth
has
two
moons
like
neptune
yes
my
friend
two
moons
though
she
is
generally
supposed
to
have
but
one
but
this
second
moon
is
so
small
and
her
speed
so
great
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
can
not
perceive
her
it
was
by
taking
into
account
certain
perturbations
that
a
french
astronomer
petit
was
able
to
determine
the
existence
of
this
second
satellite
and
calculate
its
elements
according
to
his
observations
this
asteroid
accomplishes
its
revolution
round
the
earth
in
three
hours
and
twenty
minutes
only
that
implies
prodigious
speed
do
all
astronomers
admit
the
existence
of
this
satellite
asked
nicholl
no
answered
barbicane
but
if
they
had
met
it
like
we
have
they
could
not
doubt
any
longer
this
asteroid
which
would
have
much
embarrassed
us
had
it
knocked
against
us
allows
us
to
determine
our
position
in
space
how
said
ardan
because
its
distance
is
known
and
where
we
met
it
we
were
exactly
at
kilometres
from
the
surface
of
the
terrestrial
globe
more
than
leagues
cried
michel
ardan
that
beats
the
express
trains
of
the
pitiable
globe
called
the
earth
i
should
think
it
did
answered
nicholl
consulting
his
chronometer
it
is
eleven
only
thirteen
minutes
since
we
left
the
american
continent
only
thirteen
minutes
said
barbicane
that
is
all
answered
nicholl
and
if
our
initial
velocity
were
constant
we
should
make
nearly
leagues
an
hour
that
is
all
very
well
my
friends
said
the
president
but
one
insoluble
question
still
remains
why
did
we
not
hear
the
detonation
of
the
columbiad
for
want
of
an
answer
the
conversation
stopped
and
barbicane
still
reflecting
occupied
himself
with
lowering
the
covering
of
the
second
lateral
his
operation
succeeded
and
through
the
glass
the
moon
filled
the
interior
of
the
projectile
with
brilliant
light
nicholl
like
an
economical
man
put
out
the
gas
that
was
thus
rendered
useless
and
the
brilliance
of
which
obstructed
the
observation
of
planetary
space
the
lunar
disc
then
shone
with
incomparable
purity
her
rays
no
longer
filtered
by
the
vapoury
atmosphere
of
the
terrestrial
globe
shone
clearly
through
the
glass
and
saturated
the
interior
air
of
the
projectile
with
silvery
reflections
the
black
curtain
of
the
firmament
really
doubled
the
brilliancy
of
the
moon
which
in
this
void
of
ether
unfavourable
to
diffusion
did
not
eclipse
the
neighbouring
stars
the
sky
thus
seen
presented
quite
a
different
aspect
one
that
no
human
eye
could
imagine
it
will
be
readily
understood
with
what
interest
these
audacious
men
contemplated
the
moon
the
supreme
goal
of
their
journey
the
satellite
in
her
movement
of
translation
insensibly
neared
the
zenith
a
mathematical
point
which
she
was
to
reach
about
hours
later
her
mountains
and
plains
or
any
object
in
relief
were
not
seen
more
plainly
than
from
the
earth
but
her
light
across
the
void
was
developed
with
incomparable
intensity
the
disc
shone
like
a
platinum
mirror
the
travellers
had
already
forgotten
all
about
the
earth
which
was
flying
beneath
their
feet
it
was
captain
nicholl
who
first
drew
attention
to
the
vanished
globe
yes
answered
michel
ardan
we
must
not
be
ungrateful
to
it
as
we
are
leaving
our
country
let
our
last
looks
reach
it
i
want
to
see
the
earth
before
it
disappears
completely
from
our
eyes
barbicane
to
satisfy
the
desires
of
his
companion
occupied
himself
with
clearing
the
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
the
one
through
which
they
could
observe
the
earth
directly
the
movable
floor
which
the
force
of
projection
had
sent
to
the
bottom
was
taken
to
pieces
not
without
difficulty
its
pieces
carefully
placed
against
the
sides
might
still
be
of
use
then
appeared
a
circular
bay
window
half
a
yard
wide
cut
in
the
lower
part
of
the
bullet
it
was
filled
with
glass
five
inches
thick
strengthened
with
brass
settings
under
it
was
an
aluminium
plate
held
down
by
bolts
the
screws
taken
out
and
the
bolts
withdrawn
the
plate
fell
back
and
visual
communication
was
established
between
interior
and
exterior
michel
ardan
knelt
upon
the
glass
it
was
dark
and
seemed
opaque
well
cried
he
but
where
the
earth
there
it
is
said
barbicane
what
cried
ardan
that
thin
streak
that
silvery
crescent
certainly
michel
in
four
days
time
when
the
moon
is
full
at
the
very
minute
we
shall
reach
her
the
earth
will
be
new
she
will
only
appear
to
us
under
the
form
of
a
slender
crescent
which
will
soon
disappear
and
then
she
will
be
buried
for
some
days
in
impenetrable
darkness
that
the
earth
repeated
michel
ardan
staring
at
the
thin
slice
of
his
natal
planet
the
explanation
given
by
president
barbicane
was
correct
the
earth
looked
at
from
the
projectile
was
entering
her
last
quarter
she
was
in
her
octant
and
her
crescent
was
clearly
outlined
on
the
dark
background
of
the
sky
her
light
made
bluish
by
the
thickness
of
her
atmosphere
was
less
intense
than
that
of
the
lunar
crescent
this
crescent
then
showed
itself
under
considerable
dimensions
it
looked
like
an
enormous
arch
stretched
across
the
firmament
some
points
more
vividly
lighted
especially
in
its
concave
part
announced
the
presence
of
high
mountains
but
they
disappeared
sometimes
under
black
spots
which
are
never
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
lunar
disc
they
were
rings
of
clouds
placed
concentrically
round
the
terrestrial
spheroid
however
by
dint
of
a
natural
phenomenon
identical
with
that
produced
on
the
moon
when
she
is
in
her
octants
the
contour
of
the
terrestrial
globe
could
be
traced
its
entire
disc
appeared
slightly
visible
through
an
effect
of
pale
light
less
appreciable
than
that
of
the
moon
the
reason
of
this
lessened
intensity
is
easy
to
understand
when
this
reflection
is
produced
on
the
moon
it
is
caused
by
the
solar
rays
which
the
earth
reflects
upon
her
satellite
here
it
was
caused
by
the
solar
rays
reflected
from
the
moon
upon
the
earth
now
terrestrial
light
is
thirteen
times
more
intense
than
lunar
light
on
account
of
the
difference
of
volume
in
the
two
bodies
hence
it
follows
that
in
the
phenomenon
of
the
pale
light
the
dark
part
of
the
earth
disc
is
less
clearly
outlined
than
that
of
the
moon
disc
because
the
intensity
of
the
phenomenon
is
in
proportion
to
the
lighting
power
of
the
two
stars
it
must
be
added
that
the
terrestrial
crescent
seems
to
form
a
more
elongated
curve
than
that
of
the
disc
a
pure
effect
of
irradiation
whilst
the
travellers
were
trying
to
pierce
the
profound
darkness
of
space
a
brilliant
shower
of
falling
stars
shone
before
their
eyes
hundreds
of
meteors
inflamed
by
contact
with
the
atmosphere
streaked
the
darkness
with
luminous
trails
and
lined
the
cloudy
part
of
the
disc
with
their
fire
at
that
epoch
the
earth
was
in
her
perihelion
and
the
month
of
december
is
so
propitious
to
these
shooting
stars
that
astronomers
have
counted
as
many
as
an
hour
but
michel
ardan
disdaining
scientific
reasoning
preferred
to
believe
that
the
earth
was
saluting
with
her
finest
fireworks
the
departure
of
her
three
children
this
was
all
they
saw
of
the
globe
lost
in
the
darkness
an
inferior
star
of
the
solar
world
which
for
the
grand
planets
rises
or
sets
as
a
simple
morning
or
evening
star
imperceptible
point
in
space
it
was
now
only
a
fugitive
crescent
this
globe
where
they
had
left
all
their
affections
for
a
long
time
the
three
friends
not
speaking
yet
united
in
heart
watched
while
the
projectile
went
on
with
uniformly
decreasing
velocity
then
irresistible
sleep
took
possession
of
them
was
it
fatigue
of
body
and
mind
doubtless
for
after
the
excitement
of
the
last
hours
passed
upon
earth
reaction
must
inevitably
set
in
well
said
michel
as
we
must
sleep
let
us
go
to
sleep
stretched
upon
their
beds
all
three
were
soon
buried
in
profound
slumber
but
they
had
not
been
unconscious
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
barbicane
suddenly
rose
and
waking
his
companions
in
a
loud
voice
cried
i
found
it
what
have
you
found
asked
michel
ardan
jumping
out
of
bed
the
reason
we
did
not
hear
the
detonation
of
the
columbiad
well
said
nicholl
it
was
because
our
projectile
went
quicker
than
sound
chapter
iii
taking
possession
this
curious
but
certainly
correct
explanation
once
given
the
three
friends
fell
again
into
a
profound
sleep
where
would
they
have
found
a
calmer
or
more
peaceful
place
to
sleep
in
upon
earth
houses
in
the
town
or
cottages
in
the
country
feel
every
shock
upon
the
surface
of
the
globe
at
sea
ships
rocked
by
the
waves
are
in
perpetual
movement
in
the
air
balloons
incessantly
oscillate
upon
the
fluid
strata
of
different
densities
this
projectile
alone
travelling
in
absolute
void
amidst
absolute
silence
offered
absolute
repose
to
its
inhabitants
the
sleep
of
the
three
adventurers
would
have
perhaps
been
indefinitely
prolonged
if
an
unexpected
noise
had
not
awakened
them
about
on
the
of
december
eight
hours
after
their
departure
this
noise
was
a
very
distinct
bark
the
dogs
it
is
the
dogs
cried
michel
ardan
getting
up
immediately
they
are
hungry
said
nicholl
i
should
think
so
answered
michel
we
have
forgotten
them
where
are
they
asked
barbicane
one
of
the
animals
was
found
cowering
under
the
divan
terrified
and
stunned
by
the
first
shock
it
had
remained
in
a
corner
until
the
moment
it
had
recovered
its
voice
along
with
the
feeling
of
hunger
it
was
diana
still
rather
sheepish
that
came
from
the
retreat
not
without
urging
michel
ardan
encouraged
her
with
his
most
gracious
words
come
diana
he
said
come
my
child
your
destiny
will
be
noted
in
cynegetic
annals
pagans
would
have
made
you
companion
to
the
god
anubis
and
christians
friend
to
roch
you
are
worthy
of
being
carved
in
bronze
for
the
king
of
hell
like
the
puppy
that
jupiter
gave
beautiful
europa
as
the
price
of
a
kiss
your
celebrity
will
efface
that
of
the
montargis
and
bernard
heroes
you
are
rushing
through
interplanetary
space
and
will
perhaps
be
the
eve
of
selenite
dogs
you
will
justify
up
there
toussenel
saying
the
beginning
god
created
man
and
seeing
how
weak
he
was
gave
him
the
dog
come
diana
come
here
diana
whether
flattered
or
not
came
out
slowly
uttering
plaintive
moans
good
said
barbicane
i
see
eve
but
where
is
adam
adam
answered
michel
ardan
ca
be
far
off
he
is
here
somewhere
he
must
be
called
satellite
here
satellite
but
satellite
did
not
appear
diana
continued
moaning
it
was
decided
however
that
she
was
not
wounded
and
an
appetising
dish
was
set
before
her
to
stop
her
complaining
as
to
satellite
he
seemed
lost
they
were
obliged
to
search
a
long
time
before
discovering
him
in
one
of
the
upper
compartments
of
the
projectile
where
a
rather
inexplicable
rebound
had
hurled
him
violently
the
poor
animal
was
in
a
pitiable
condition
the
devil
said
michel
our
acclimatisation
is
in
danger
the
unfortunate
dog
was
carefully
lowered
his
head
had
been
fractured
against
the
roof
and
it
seemed
difficult
for
him
to
survive
such
a
shock
nevertheless
he
was
comfortably
stretched
on
a
cushion
where
he
sighed
once
we
will
take
care
of
you
said
michel
we
are
responsible
for
your
existence
i
would
rather
lose
an
arm
than
a
paw
of
my
poor
satellite
so
saying
he
offered
some
water
to
the
wounded
animal
who
drank
it
greedily
these
attentions
bestowed
the
travellers
attentively
watched
the
earth
and
the
moon
the
earth
only
appeared
like
a
pale
disc
terminated
by
a
crescent
smaller
than
that
of
the
previous
evening
but
its
volume
compared
with
that
of
the
moon
which
was
gradually
forming
a
perfect
circle
remained
enormous
then
said
michel
ardan
i
am
really
sorry
we
did
not
start
when
the
earth
was
at
her
full
that
is
to
say
when
our
globe
was
in
opposition
to
the
sun
why
asked
nicholl
because
we
should
have
seen
our
continents
and
seas
under
a
new
aspect
the
continents
shining
under
the
solar
rays
the
seas
darker
like
they
figure
upon
certain
maps
of
the
world
i
should
like
to
have
seen
those
poles
of
the
earth
upon
which
the
eye
of
man
has
never
yet
rested
i
daresay
answered
barbicane
but
if
the
earth
had
been
full
the
moon
would
have
been
new
that
is
to
say
invisible
amidst
the
irradiation
of
the
sun
it
is
better
for
us
to
see
the
goal
we
want
to
reach
than
the
place
we
started
from
you
are
right
barbicane
answered
captain
nicholl
and
besides
when
we
have
reached
the
moon
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
during
the
long
lunar
nights
to
consider
at
leisure
the
globe
that
harbours
men
like
us
men
like
us
cried
michel
ardan
but
now
they
are
not
more
like
us
than
the
selenites
we
are
inhabitants
of
a
new
world
peopled
by
us
alone
the
projectile
i
am
a
man
like
barbicane
and
barbicane
is
a
man
like
nicholl
beyond
us
and
outside
of
us
humanity
ends
and
we
are
the
only
population
of
this
microcosm
until
the
moment
we
become
simple
selenites
in
about
hours
replied
the
captain
which
means
asked
michel
ardan
that
it
is
eight
answered
nicholl
very
well
answered
michel
i
fail
to
find
the
shadow
of
a
reason
why
we
should
not
breakfast
in
fact
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
star
could
not
live
in
it
without
eating
and
their
stomachs
then
submitted
to
the
imperious
laws
of
hunger
michel
ardan
in
his
quality
of
frenchman
declared
himself
chief
cook
an
important
function
that
no
one
disputed
with
him
the
gas
gave
the
necessary
degrees
of
heat
for
cooking
purposes
and
the
furnished
the
elements
of
this
first
banquet
the
breakfast
began
with
three
cups
of
excellent
broth
due
to
the
liquefaction
in
hot
water
of
three
precious
liebig
tablets
prepared
from
the
choicest
morsels
of
the
pampas
ruminants
some
slices
of
beefsteak
succeeded
them
compressed
by
the
hydraulic
press
as
tender
and
succulent
as
if
they
had
just
come
from
the
butchers
of
the
paris
caf√©
anglais
michel
an
imaginative
man
would
have
it
they
were
even
rosy
preserved
vegetables
fresher
than
the
natural
ones
as
the
amiable
michel
observed
succeeded
the
meat
and
were
followed
by
some
cups
of
tea
and
slices
of
bread
and
butter
american
fashion
this
beverage
pronounced
excellent
was
made
from
tea
of
the
first
quality
of
which
the
emperor
of
russia
had
put
some
cases
at
the
disposition
of
the
travellers
lastly
as
a
worthy
ending
to
the
meal
ardan
ferreted
out
a
fine
bottle
of
nuits
burgundy
that
happened
to
be
in
the
provision
compartment
the
three
friends
drank
it
to
the
union
of
the
earth
and
her
satellite
and
as
if
the
generous
wine
it
had
distilled
upon
the
of
burgundy
were
not
enough
the
sun
was
determined
to
help
in
the
feast
the
projectile
at
that
moment
emerged
from
the
cone
of
shadow
cast
by
the
terrestrial
globe
and
the
sun
rays
fell
directly
upon
the
lower
disc
of
the
bullet
on
account
of
the
angle
which
the
orbit
of
the
moon
makes
with
that
of
the
earth
the
sun
exclaimed
michel
ardan
of
course
answered
barbicane
i
expected
it
but
said
michel
the
cone
of
shadow
thrown
by
the
earth
into
space
extends
beyond
the
moon
much
beyond
if
you
do
not
take
the
atmospheric
refraction
into
account
said
barbicane
but
when
the
moon
is
enveloped
in
that
shadow
the
centres
of
the
three
heavenly
bodies
the
sun
the
earth
and
the
moon
are
in
a
straight
line
then
the
nodes
coincide
with
the
full
moon
and
there
is
an
eclipse
if
therefore
we
had
started
during
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
all
our
journey
would
have
been
accomplished
in
the
dark
which
would
have
been
a
pity
why
because
although
we
are
journeying
in
the
void
our
projectile
bathed
in
the
solar
rays
will
gather
their
light
and
heat
therefore
there
will
be
economy
of
gas
a
precious
economy
in
every
way
in
fact
under
these
rays
the
temperature
and
brilliancy
of
which
there
was
no
atmosphere
to
soften
the
projectile
was
lighted
and
warmed
as
if
it
had
suddenly
passed
from
winter
to
summer
the
moon
above
and
the
sun
below
inundated
it
with
their
rays
it
is
pleasant
here
now
said
nicholl
i
believe
you
cried
michel
ardan
with
a
little
vegetable
soil
spread
over
our
aluminium
planet
we
could
grow
green
peas
in
hours
i
have
only
one
fear
that
is
that
the
walls
of
our
bullet
will
melt
you
need
not
alarm
yourself
my
worthy
friend
answered
barbicane
the
projectile
supported
a
much
higher
temperature
while
it
was
travelling
through
the
atmosphere
i
should
not
even
wonder
if
it
looked
to
the
eyes
of
the
spectators
like
a
fiery
meteor
then
maston
must
think
we
are
roasted
what
i
am
astonished
at
answered
barbicane
is
that
we
are
not
it
was
a
danger
we
did
not
foresee
i
feared
it
answered
nicholl
simply
and
you
did
not
say
anything
about
it
sublime
captain
cried
michel
ardan
shaking
his
companion
hand
in
the
meantime
barbicane
was
making
his
arrangements
in
the
projectile
as
though
he
was
never
going
to
leave
it
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
base
of
the
a√´rial
vehicle
was
feet
square
it
was
twelve
feet
high
and
admirably
fitted
up
in
the
interior
it
was
not
much
encumbered
by
the
instruments
and
travelling
utensils
which
were
all
in
special
places
and
it
left
some
liberty
of
movement
to
its
three
inhabitants
the
thick
glass
let
into
a
part
of
the
floor
could
bear
considerable
weight
with
impunity
barbicane
and
his
companions
walked
upon
it
as
well
as
upon
a
solid
floor
but
the
sun
which
struck
it
directly
with
its
rays
lighting
the
interior
of
the
projectile
from
below
produced
singular
effects
of
light
they
began
by
examining
the
state
of
the
water
and
provision
receptacles
they
were
not
in
the
least
damaged
thanks
to
the
precautions
taken
to
deaden
the
shock
the
provisions
were
abundant
and
sufficient
for
one
year
food
barbicane
took
this
precaution
in
case
the
projectile
should
arrive
upon
an
absolutely
barren
part
of
the
moon
there
was
only
enough
water
and
brandy
for
two
months
but
according
to
the
latest
observations
of
astronomers
the
moon
had
a
dense
low
and
thick
atmosphere
at
least
in
its
deepest
valleys
and
there
streams
and
watercourses
could
not
fail
therefore
the
adventurous
explorers
would
not
suffer
from
hunger
or
thirst
during
the
journey
and
the
first
year
of
their
installation
upon
the
lunar
continent
the
question
of
air
in
the
interior
of
the
projectile
also
offered
all
security
the
reiset
and
regnault
apparatus
destined
to
produce
oxygen
was
furnished
with
enough
chlorate
of
potash
for
two
months
it
necessarily
consumed
a
large
quantity
of
gas
for
it
was
obliged
to
keep
the
productive
matter
up
to
but
there
was
abundance
of
that
also
the
apparatus
wanted
little
looking
after
it
worked
automatically
at
that
high
temperature
the
chlorate
of
potash
changed
into
chlorine
of
potassium
and
gave
out
all
the
oxygen
it
contained
the
eighteen
pounds
of
chlorate
of
potash
gave
out
the
seven
pounds
of
oxygen
necessary
for
the
daily
consumption
of
the
three
travellers
but
it
was
not
enough
to
renew
the
oxygen
consumed
the
carbonic
acid
gas
produced
by
expiration
must
also
be
absorbed
now
for
the
last
twelve
hours
the
atmosphere
of
the
bullet
had
become
loaded
with
this
deleterious
gas
the
product
of
the
combustion
of
the
elements
of
blood
by
the
oxygen
taken
into
the
lungs
nicholl
perceived
this
state
of
the
air
by
seeing
diana
palpitate
painfully
in
fact
carbonic
acid
gas
through
a
phenomenon
identical
with
the
one
to
be
noticed
in
the
famous
dog
grotto
accumulated
at
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
by
reason
of
its
weight
poor
diana
whose
head
was
low
down
therefore
necessarily
suffered
from
it
before
her
masters
but
captain
nicholl
made
haste
to
remedy
this
state
of
things
he
placed
on
the
floor
of
the
projectile
several
receptacles
containing
caustic
potash
which
he
shook
about
for
some
time
and
this
matter
which
is
very
greedy
of
carbonic
acid
completely
absorbed
it
and
thus
purified
the
interior
air
an
inventory
of
the
instruments
was
then
begun
the
thermometers
and
barometers
were
undamaged
with
the
exception
of
a
minimum
thermometer
the
glass
of
which
was
broken
an
excellent
aneroid
was
taken
out
of
its
padded
box
and
hung
upon
the
wall
of
course
it
was
only
acted
upon
by
and
indicated
the
pressure
of
the
air
inside
the
projectile
but
it
also
indicated
the
quantity
of
moisture
it
contained
at
that
moment
its
needle
oscillated
between
and
it
was
at
set
fair
barbicane
had
brought
several
compasses
which
were
found
intact
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
under
those
circumstances
their
needles
were
acting
at
random
without
any
constant
direction
in
fact
at
the
distance
the
projectile
was
from
the
earth
the
magnetic
pole
could
not
exercise
any
sensible
action
upon
the
apparatus
but
these
compasses
taken
upon
the
lunar
disc
might
show
particular
phenomena
in
any
case
it
would
be
interesting
to
verify
whether
the
earth
satellite
like
the
earth
herself
submitted
to
magnetical
influence
a
hypsometer
to
measure
the
altitude
of
the
lunar
mountains
a
sextant
to
take
the
height
of
the
sun
a
theodolite
an
instrument
for
surveying
telescopes
to
be
used
as
the
moon
approached
all
these
instruments
were
carefully
inspected
and
found
in
good
condition
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
initial
shock
as
to
the
utensils
pickaxes
spades
and
different
tools
of
which
nicholl
had
made
a
special
collection
the
sacks
of
various
kinds
of
grain
and
the
shrubs
which
michel
ardan
counted
upon
transplanting
into
selenite
soil
they
were
in
their
places
in
the
upper
corners
of
the
projectile
there
was
made
a
sort
of
granary
which
the
prodigal
frenchman
had
filled
what
was
in
it
was
very
little
known
and
the
merry
fellow
did
not
enlighten
anybody
from
time
to
time
he
climbed
up
the
riveted
in
the
walls
to
this
the
inspection
of
which
he
had
reserved
to
himself
he
arranged
and
plunged
his
hand
rapidly
into
certain
mysterious
boxes
singing
all
the
time
in
a
voice
very
out
of
tune
some
old
french
song
to
enliven
the
situation
barbicane
noticed
with
interest
that
his
rockets
and
other
fireworks
were
not
damaged
these
were
important
for
powerfully
loaded
they
were
meant
to
slacken
the
speed
with
which
the
projectile
would
when
attracted
by
the
moon
after
passing
the
point
of
neutral
attraction
fall
upon
her
surface
this
fall
besides
would
be
six
times
less
rapid
than
it
would
have
been
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
thanks
to
the
difference
of
volume
in
the
two
bodies
the
inspection
ended
therefore
in
general
satisfaction
then
they
all
returned
to
their
posts
of
observation
at
the
lateral
and
lower
the
same
spectacle
was
spread
before
them
all
the
extent
of
the
celestial
sphere
swarmed
with
stars
and
constellations
of
marvellous
brilliancy
enough
to
make
an
astronomer
wild
on
one
side
the
sun
like
the
mouth
of
a
fiery
furnace
shone
upon
the
dark
background
of
the
heavens
on
the
other
side
the
moon
reflecting
back
his
fires
seemed
motionless
amidst
the
starry
world
then
a
large
spot
like
a
hole
in
the
firmament
bordered
still
by
a
slight
thread
of
silver
it
was
the
earth
here
and
there
nebulous
masses
like
large
and
from
zenith
to
nadir
an
immense
ring
formed
of
an
impalpable
dust
of
stars
that
milky
way
amidst
which
the
sun
only
counts
as
a
star
of
the
fourth
magnitude
the
spectators
could
not
take
their
eyes
off
a
spectacle
so
new
of
which
no
description
could
give
any
idea
what
reflections
it
suggested
what
unknown
emotions
it
aroused
in
the
soul
barbicane
wished
to
begin
the
recital
of
his
journey
under
the
empire
of
these
impressions
and
he
noted
down
hourly
all
the
events
that
signalised
the
beginning
of
his
enterprise
he
wrote
tranquilly
in
his
large
and
rather
handwriting
during
that
time
the
calculating
nicholl
looked
over
the
formulae
of
trajectories
and
worked
away
at
figures
with
unparalleled
dexterity
michel
ardan
talked
sometimes
to
barbicane
who
did
not
answer
much
to
nicholl
who
did
not
hear
and
to
diana
who
did
not
understand
his
theories
and
lastly
to
himself
making
questions
and
answers
going
and
coming
occupying
himself
with
a
thousand
details
sometimes
leaning
over
the
lower
sometimes
roosting
in
the
heights
of
the
projectile
singing
all
the
time
in
this
microcosm
he
represented
the
french
agitation
and
loquacity
and
it
was
worthily
represented
the
day
or
rather
for
the
expression
is
not
correct
the
lapse
of
twelve
hours
which
makes
a
day
upon
earth
was
ended
by
a
copious
supper
carefully
prepared
no
incident
of
a
nature
to
shake
the
confidence
of
the
travellers
had
happened
so
full
of
hope
and
already
sure
of
success
they
went
to
sleep
peacefully
whilst
the
projectile
at
a
uniformly
increasing
speed
made
its
way
in
the
heavens
chapter
iv
a
little
algebra
the
night
passed
without
incident
correctly
speaking
the
word
night
is
an
improper
one
the
position
of
the
projectile
in
regard
to
the
sun
did
not
change
astronomically
it
was
day
on
the
bottom
of
the
bullet
and
night
on
the
top
when
therefore
in
this
recital
these
two
words
are
used
they
express
the
lapse
of
time
between
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
upon
earth
the
travellers
sleep
was
so
much
the
more
peaceful
because
notwithstanding
its
excessive
speed
the
projectile
seemed
absolutely
motionless
no
movement
indicated
its
journey
through
space
however
rapidly
change
of
place
may
be
effected
it
can
not
produce
any
sensible
effect
upon
the
organism
when
it
takes
place
in
the
void
or
when
the
mass
of
air
circulates
along
with
the
travelling
body
what
inhabitant
of
the
earth
perceives
the
speed
which
carries
him
along
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
movement
under
such
circumstances
is
not
felt
more
than
repose
every
object
is
indifferent
to
it
when
a
body
is
in
repose
it
remains
so
until
some
foreign
force
puts
it
in
movement
when
in
movement
it
would
never
stop
if
some
obstacle
were
not
in
its
road
this
indifference
to
movement
or
repose
is
inertia
barbicane
and
his
companions
could
therefore
imagine
themselves
absolutely
motionless
shut
up
in
the
interior
of
the
projectile
the
effect
would
have
been
the
same
if
they
had
placed
themselves
on
the
outside
without
the
moon
which
grew
larger
above
them
and
the
earth
that
grew
smaller
below
they
would
have
sworn
they
were
suspended
in
a
complete
stagnation
that
morning
the
of
december
they
were
awakened
by
a
joyful
but
unexpected
noise
it
was
the
crowing
of
a
cock
in
the
interior
of
their
vehicle
michel
ardan
was
the
first
to
get
up
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
projectile
and
closed
a
case
be
quiet
said
he
in
a
whisper
that
animal
will
spoil
my
plan
in
the
meantime
nicholl
and
barbicane
awoke
was
that
a
cock
said
nicholl
no
my
friends
answered
michel
quickly
i
wished
to
awake
you
with
that
rural
sound
so
saying
he
gave
vent
to
a
which
would
have
done
honour
to
the
proudest
of
gallinaceans
the
two
americans
could
not
help
laughing
a
fine
accomplishment
that
said
nicholl
looking
suspiciously
at
his
companion
yes
answered
michel
a
joke
common
in
my
country
it
is
very
gallic
we
perpetrate
it
in
the
best
society
then
turning
the
conversation
barbicane
do
you
know
what
i
have
been
thinking
about
all
night
no
answered
the
president
about
our
friends
at
cambridge
you
have
already
remarked
how
admirably
ignorant
i
am
of
mathematics
i
find
it
therefore
impossible
to
guess
how
our
of
the
observatory
could
calculate
what
initial
velocity
the
projectile
ought
to
be
endowed
with
on
leaving
the
columbiad
in
order
to
reach
the
moon
you
mean
replied
barbicane
in
order
to
reach
that
neutral
point
where
the
terrestrial
and
lunar
attractions
are
equal
for
beyond
this
point
situated
at
about
of
the
distance
the
projectile
will
fall
upon
the
moon
by
virtue
of
its
own
weight
merely
very
well
answered
michel
but
once
more
how
did
they
calculate
the
initial
velocity
nothing
is
easier
said
barbicane
and
could
you
have
made
the
calculation
yourself
asked
michel
ardan
certainly
nicholl
and
i
could
have
determined
it
if
the
notice
from
the
observatory
had
not
saved
us
the
trouble
well
old
fellow
answered
michel
they
might
sooner
cut
off
my
head
beginning
with
my
feet
than
have
made
me
solve
that
problem
because
you
do
not
know
algebra
replied
barbicane
tranquilly
ah
that
just
like
you
dealers
in
you
think
you
have
explained
everything
when
you
have
said
michel
replied
barbicane
do
you
think
it
possible
to
forge
without
a
hammer
or
to
plough
without
a
ploughshare
it
would
be
difficult
well
then
algebra
is
a
tool
like
a
plough
or
a
hammer
and
a
good
tool
for
any
one
who
knows
how
to
use
it
seriously
quite
could
you
use
that
tool
before
me
if
it
would
interest
you
and
could
you
show
me
how
they
calculated
the
initial
speed
of
our
vehicle
yes
my
worthy
friend
by
taking
into
account
all
the
elements
of
the
problem
the
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
to
the
centre
of
the
moon
of
the
radius
of
the
earth
the
volume
of
the
earth
and
the
volume
of
the
moon
i
can
determine
exactly
what
the
initial
speed
of
the
projectile
ought
to
be
and
that
by
a
very
simple
formula
show
me
the
formula
you
shall
see
it
only
i
will
not
give
you
the
curve
really
traced
by
the
bullet
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
by
taking
into
account
their
movement
of
translation
round
the
sun
no
i
will
consider
both
bodies
to
be
motionless
and
that
will
be
sufficient
for
us
why
because
that
would
be
seeking
to
solve
the
problem
called
problem
of
the
three
bodies
for
which
the
integral
calculus
is
not
yet
far
enough
advanced
indeed
said
michel
ardan
in
a
bantering
tone
then
mathematics
have
not
said
their
last
word
certainly
not
answered
barbicane
good
perhaps
the
selenites
have
pushed
the
integral
calculus
further
than
you
what
is
the
integral
calculus
it
is
the
inverse
of
the
differential
calculus
answered
barbicane
seriously
much
obliged
to
speak
otherwise
it
is
a
calculus
by
which
you
seek
finished
quantities
of
what
you
know
the
differential
quantities
that
is
clear
at
least
answered
barbicane
with
a
quite
satisfied
air
and
now
continued
barbicane
for
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
and
in
i
will
have
found
the
required
formula
that
said
barbicane
became
absorbed
in
his
work
whilst
nicholl
looked
into
space
leaving
the
care
of
preparing
breakfast
to
his
companion
had
not
elapsed
before
barbicane
raising
his
head
showed
michel
ardan
a
page
covered
with
algebraical
signs
amidst
which
the
following
general
formula
was
discernible
r
m
r
r
v
v
gr
x
m
and
what
does
that
mean
asked
michel
that
means
answered
nicholl
that
the
half
of
minus
zero
square
equals
multiplied
by
upon
minus
plus
prime
upon
multiplied
by
upon
minus
minus
upon
minus
minus
upon
galloping
upon
and
rearing
upon
cried
michel
ardan
bursting
out
laughing
do
you
mean
to
say
you
understand
that
captain
nothing
is
clearer
then
said
michel
ardan
it
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
and
i
want
nothing
more
everlasting
laugher
said
barbicane
you
wanted
algebra
and
now
you
shall
have
it
over
head
and
ears
i
would
rather
be
hung
that
appears
a
good
solution
barbicane
said
nicholl
who
was
examining
the
formula
like
a
it
is
the
integral
of
the
equation
of
viva
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
will
give
us
the
desired
result
but
i
should
like
to
understand
exclaimed
michel
i
would
give
ten
years
of
nicholl
life
to
understand
then
listen
resumed
barbicane
the
half
of
minus
zero
square
is
the
formula
that
gives
us
the
of
the
viva
good
and
does
nicholl
understand
what
that
means
certainly
michel
answered
the
captain
all
those
signs
that
look
so
cabalistic
to
you
form
the
clearest
and
most
logical
language
for
those
who
know
how
to
read
it
and
do
you
pretend
nicholl
asked
michel
that
by
means
of
these
hieroglyphics
more
incomprehensible
than
the
egyptian
ibis
you
can
find
the
initial
speed
necessary
to
give
to
the
projectile
incontestably
answered
nicholl
and
even
by
that
formula
i
could
always
tell
you
what
speed
it
is
going
at
on
any
point
of
the
journey
upon
your
word
of
honour
yes
then
you
are
as
clever
as
our
president
no
michel
all
the
difficulty
consists
in
what
barbicane
has
done
it
is
to
establish
an
equation
which
takes
into
account
all
the
conditions
of
the
problem
the
rest
is
only
a
question
of
arithmetic
and
requires
nothing
but
a
knowledge
of
the
four
rules
that
something
answered
michel
ardan
who
had
never
been
able
to
make
a
correct
addition
in
his
life
and
who
thus
defined
the
rule
a
chinese
puzzle
by
which
you
can
obtain
infinitely
various
results
still
barbicane
answered
that
nicholl
would
certainly
have
found
the
formula
had
he
thought
about
it
i
do
not
know
if
i
should
said
nicholl
for
the
more
i
study
it
the
more
marvellously
correct
i
find
it
now
listen
said
barbicane
to
his
ignorant
comrade
and
you
will
see
that
all
these
letters
have
a
signification
i
am
listening
said
michel
looking
resigned
said
barbicane
is
the
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
to
the
centre
of
the
moon
for
we
must
take
the
centres
to
calculate
the
attraction
that
i
understand
is
the
radius
of
the
earth
radius
admitted
is
the
volume
of
the
earth
that
of
the
moon
we
are
obliged
to
take
into
account
the
volume
of
the
two
attracting
bodies
as
the
attraction
is
in
proportion
to
the
volume
i
understand
that
represents
gravity
the
speed
acquired
at
the
end
of
a
second
by
a
body
falling
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
that
clear
a
mountain
stream
answered
michel
now
i
represent
by
the
variable
distance
that
separates
the
projectile
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
by
the
velocity
the
projectile
has
at
that
distance
good
lastly
the
expression
zero
which
figures
in
the
equation
is
the
speed
the
bullet
possesses
when
it
emerges
from
the
atmosphere
yes
said
nicholl
you
were
obliged
to
calculate
the
velocity
from
that
point
because
we
knew
before
that
the
velocity
at
departure
is
exactly
equal
to
of
the
velocity
upon
emerging
from
the
atmosphere
do
understand
any
more
said
michel
yet
it
is
very
simple
said
barbicane
i
do
not
find
it
very
simple
replied
michel
it
means
that
when
our
projectile
reached
the
limit
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
it
had
already
lost
of
its
initial
velocity
as
much
as
that
yes
my
friend
simply
by
friction
against
the
atmosphere
you
will
easily
understand
that
the
greater
its
speed
the
more
resistance
it
would
meet
with
from
the
air
that
i
admit
answered
michel
and
i
understand
it
although
your
zero
two
and
your
zero
square
shake
about
in
my
head
like
nails
in
a
sack
first
effect
of
algebra
continued
barbicane
and
now
to
finish
we
are
going
to
find
the
numerical
known
quantity
of
these
different
expressions
that
is
to
say
find
out
their
value
you
will
finish
me
first
answered
michel
some
of
these
expressions
said
barbicane
are
known
the
others
have
to
be
calculated
i
will
calculate
those
said
nicholl
and
resumed
barbicane
is
the
radius
of
the
earth
under
the
latitude
of
florida
our
point
of
departure
that
is
to
say
the
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
to
the
centre
of
the
moon
equals
terrestrial
radii
nicholl
rapidly
calculated
that
makes
metres
when
the
moon
is
at
her
perigee
that
is
to
say
when
she
is
nearest
to
the
earth
very
well
said
barbicane
now
prime
upon
that
is
to
say
the
proportion
of
the
moon
volume
to
that
of
the
earth
equals
perfect
said
michel
and
the
gravity
is
to
florida
metres
from
whence
it
results
that
equals
million
four
hundred
and
thousand
square
metres
answered
nicholl
what
next
asked
michel
ardan
now
that
the
expressions
are
reduced
to
figures
i
am
going
to
find
the
velocity
that
is
to
say
the
velocity
that
the
projectile
ought
to
have
on
leaving
the
atmosphere
to
reach
the
point
of
equal
attraction
with
no
velocity
the
velocity
at
that
point
i
make
equal
and
the
distance
where
the
neutral
point
is
will
be
represented
by
the
of
that
is
to
say
the
distance
that
separates
the
two
centres
i
have
some
vague
idea
that
it
ought
to
be
so
said
michel
i
shall
then
have
equals
of
and
equals
and
my
formula
will
become
barbicane
wrote
rapidly
on
the
paper
r
v
gr
d
nicholl
read
it
quickly
that
it
that
is
it
he
cried
is
it
clear
asked
barbicane
it
is
written
in
letters
of
fire
answered
nicholl
clever
fellows
murmured
michel
do
you
understand
now
asked
barbicane
if
i
understand
cried
michel
ardan
my
head
is
bursting
with
it
thus
resumed
barbicane
square
equals
multiplied
by
minus
upon
minus
multiplied
by
upon
minus
upon
minus
and
now
said
nicholl
in
order
to
obtain
the
velocity
of
the
bullet
as
it
emerges
from
the
atmosphere
i
have
only
to
calculate
the
captain
like
a
man
used
to
overcome
all
difficulties
began
to
calculate
with
frightful
rapidity
divisions
and
multiplications
grew
under
his
fingers
figures
dotted
the
page
barbicane
followed
him
with
his
eyes
whilst
michel
ardan
compressed
a
coming
headache
with
his
two
hands
well
what
do
you
make
it
asked
barbicane
after
several
silence
i
make
it
metres
in
the
first
second
what
do
you
say
said
barbicane
starting
eleven
thousand
and
metres
malediction
cried
the
president
with
a
gesture
of
despair
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
michel
ardan
much
surprised
the
matter
why
if
at
this
moment
the
velocity
was
already
diminished
by
friction
the
initial
speed
ought
to
have
been
sixteen
thousand
five
hundred
and
metres
answered
nicholl
but
the
cambridge
observatory
declared
that
metres
were
enough
at
departure
and
our
bullet
started
with
that
velocity
only
well
asked
nicholl
why
it
was
not
enough
no
we
shall
not
reach
the
neutral
point
the
devil
we
shall
not
even
go
half
way
exclaimed
michel
ardan
jumping
up
as
if
the
projectile
were
on
the
point
of
striking
against
the
terrestrial
globe
and
we
shall
fall
back
upon
the
earth
chapter
the
temperature
of
space
this
revelation
acted
like
a
thunderbolt
who
could
have
expected
such
an
error
in
calculation
barbicane
would
not
believe
it
nicholl
went
over
the
figures
again
they
were
correct
the
formula
which
had
established
them
could
not
be
mistrusted
and
when
verified
the
initial
velocity
of
metres
necessary
for
attaining
the
neutral
point
was
found
quite
right
the
three
friends
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
no
one
thought
about
breakfast
after
that
barbicane
with
set
teeth
contracted
brow
and
fists
convulsively
closed
looked
through
the
nicholl
folded
his
arms
and
examined
his
calculations
michel
ardan
murmured
that
just
like
that
the
way
they
always
do
i
would
give
twenty
pistoles
to
fall
upon
the
cambridge
observatory
and
crush
it
with
all
its
stupid
staff
inside
all
at
once
the
captain
made
a
reflection
which
struck
barbicane
at
once
why
said
he
it
is
seven
in
the
morning
so
we
have
been
hours
on
the
road
we
have
come
more
than
half
way
and
we
are
not
falling
yet
that
i
know
of
barbicane
did
not
answer
but
after
a
rapid
glance
at
the
captain
he
took
a
compass
which
he
used
to
measure
the
angular
distance
of
the
terrestrial
globe
then
through
the
lower
he
made
a
very
exact
observation
from
the
apparent
immobility
of
the
projectile
then
rising
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
he
put
down
some
figures
upon
paper
nicholl
saw
that
the
president
wished
to
find
out
from
the
length
of
the
terrestrial
diameter
the
distance
of
the
bullet
from
the
earth
he
looked
at
him
anxiously
no
cried
barbicane
in
a
few
minutes
time
we
are
not
falling
we
are
already
more
than
leagues
from
the
earth
we
have
passed
the
point
the
projectile
ought
to
have
stopped
at
if
its
speed
had
been
only
metres
at
our
departure
we
are
still
ascending
that
is
evident
answered
nicholl
so
we
must
conclude
that
our
initial
velocity
under
the
propulsion
of
the
lbs
of
was
greater
than
the
metres
i
can
now
explain
to
myself
why
we
met
with
the
second
satellite
that
gravitates
at
more
than
leagues
from
the
earth
in
less
than
thirteen
minutes
that
explanation
is
so
much
the
more
probable
added
barbicane
because
by
throwing
out
the
water
in
our
movable
partitions
the
projectile
was
made
considerably
lighter
all
at
once
that
is
true
said
nicholl
ah
my
brave
nicholl
cried
barbicane
we
are
saved
very
well
then
answered
michel
ardan
tranquilly
as
we
are
saved
let
us
have
breakfast
nicholl
was
not
mistaken
the
initial
speed
had
happily
been
greater
than
that
indicated
by
the
cambridge
observatory
but
the
cambridge
observatory
had
no
less
been
mistaken
the
travellers
recovered
from
their
false
alarm
sat
down
to
table
and
breakfasted
merrily
though
they
ate
much
they
talked
more
their
confidence
was
greater
after
the
algebra
incident
why
should
we
not
succeed
repeated
michel
ardan
why
should
we
not
arrive
we
are
on
the
road
there
are
no
obstacles
before
us
and
no
stones
on
our
route
it
is
free
freer
than
that
of
a
ship
that
has
to
struggle
with
the
sea
or
a
balloon
with
the
wind
against
it
now
if
a
ship
can
go
where
it
pleases
or
a
balloon
ascend
where
it
pleases
why
should
not
our
projectile
reach
the
goal
it
was
aimed
at
it
will
reach
it
said
barbicane
if
only
to
honour
the
american
nation
added
michel
ardan
the
only
nation
capable
of
making
such
an
enterprise
succeed
the
only
one
that
could
have
produced
a
president
barbicane
ah
now
i
think
of
it
now
that
all
our
anxieties
are
over
what
will
become
of
us
we
shall
be
as
dull
as
stagnant
water
barbicane
and
nicholl
made
gestures
of
repudiation
but
i
foresaw
this
my
friends
resumed
michel
ardan
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
i
have
chess
backgammon
cards
and
dominoes
at
your
disposition
we
only
want
a
what
asked
barbicane
did
you
bring
such
trifles
as
those
certainly
answered
michel
not
only
for
our
amusement
but
also
in
the
praiseworthy
intention
of
bestowing
them
upon
selenite
inns
my
friend
said
barbicane
if
the
moon
is
inhabited
its
inhabitants
appeared
some
thousands
of
years
before
those
of
the
earth
for
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
moon
is
older
than
the
earth
if
therefore
the
selenites
have
existed
for
thousands
of
centuries
if
their
brains
are
organised
like
that
of
human
beings
they
have
invented
all
that
we
have
invented
already
and
even
what
we
shall
only
invent
in
the
lapse
of
centuries
they
will
have
nothing
to
learn
from
us
and
we
shall
have
everything
to
learn
from
them
what
answered
michel
do
you
think
they
have
had
artists
like
phidias
michael
angelo
or
raphael
yes
poets
like
homer
virgil
milton
lamartine
and
hugo
i
am
sure
of
it
philosophers
like
plato
aristotle
descartes
and
kant
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
like
archimedes
euclid
pascal
and
newton
i
could
swear
it
clowns
like
arnal
and
photographers
like
nadar
i
am
certain
of
it
then
friend
barbicane
if
these
selenites
are
as
learned
as
we
and
even
more
so
why
have
they
not
hurled
a
lunar
projectile
as
far
as
the
terrestrial
regions
who
says
they
have
not
done
it
answered
barbicane
seriously
in
fact
added
nicholl
it
would
have
been
easier
to
them
than
to
us
and
that
for
two
reasons
the
first
because
the
attraction
is
six
times
less
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
than
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
which
would
allow
a
projectile
to
go
up
more
easily
secondly
the
projectile
would
only
have
leagues
to
travel
instead
of
which
would
require
a
force
of
propulsion
ten
times
less
then
resumed
michel
i
repeat
why
have
they
not
done
it
and
i
replied
barbicane
i
repeat
who
says
they
have
not
done
it
when
hundreds
of
centuries
ago
before
man
appearance
upon
earth
and
the
bullet
where
is
the
bullet
i
ask
to
see
the
bullet
my
friend
answered
barbicane
the
sea
covers
of
our
globe
hence
there
are
five
good
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
lunar
projectile
if
it
has
been
fired
is
now
submerged
at
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
or
pacific
unless
it
was
buried
down
some
abyss
at
the
epoch
when
the
earth
crust
was
not
sufficiently
formed
old
fellow
answered
michel
you
have
an
answer
to
everything
and
i
bow
before
your
wisdom
there
is
one
hypothesis
i
would
rather
believe
than
the
others
and
that
is
that
the
selenites
being
older
than
we
are
wiser
and
have
not
invented
gunpowder
at
all
at
that
moment
diana
claimed
her
share
in
the
conversation
by
a
sonorous
bark
she
asked
for
her
breakfast
ah
said
michel
ardan
our
arguments
make
us
forget
diana
and
satellite
a
good
dish
of
food
was
immediately
offered
to
the
dog
who
devoured
it
with
great
appetite
do
you
know
barbicane
said
michel
we
ought
to
have
made
this
projectile
a
sort
of
noah
ark
and
have
taken
a
couple
of
all
the
domestic
animals
with
us
to
the
moon
no
doubt
answered
barbicane
but
we
should
not
have
had
room
enough
oh
we
might
have
been
packed
a
little
tighter
the
fact
is
answered
nicholl
that
oxen
cows
bulls
and
horses
all
those
ruminants
would
be
useful
on
the
lunar
continent
unfortunately
we
can
not
make
our
projectile
either
a
stable
or
a
cowshed
but
at
least
said
michel
ardan
we
might
have
brought
an
ass
nothing
but
a
little
ass
the
courageous
and
patient
animal
old
silenus
loved
to
exhibit
i
am
fond
of
those
poor
asses
they
are
the
least
favoured
animals
in
creation
they
are
not
only
beaten
during
their
lifetime
but
are
still
beaten
after
their
death
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
barbicane
why
do
they
use
his
skin
to
make
drums
of
barbicane
and
nicholl
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
absurd
reflection
but
a
cry
from
their
merry
companion
stopped
them
he
was
bending
over
satellite
niche
and
rose
up
saying
good
satellite
is
no
longer
ah
said
nicholl
no
resumed
michel
he
is
dead
now
he
added
in
a
pitiful
tone
this
will
be
embarrassing
i
very
much
fear
poor
diana
that
you
will
not
leave
any
of
your
race
in
the
lunar
regions
the
unfortunate
satellite
had
not
been
able
to
survive
his
wounds
he
was
dead
stone
dead
michel
ardan
much
put
out
of
countenance
looked
at
his
friends
this
makes
another
difficulty
said
barbicane
we
ca
keep
the
dead
body
of
this
dog
with
us
for
another
hours
no
certainly
not
answered
nicholl
but
our
are
hung
upon
hinges
they
can
be
let
down
we
will
open
one
of
them
and
throw
the
body
into
space
the
president
reflected
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
yes
that
is
what
we
must
do
but
we
must
take
the
most
minute
precautions
why
asked
michel
for
two
reasons
that
i
will
explain
to
you
answered
barbicane
the
first
has
reference
to
the
air
in
the
projectile
of
which
we
must
lose
as
little
as
possible
but
we
can
renew
the
air
not
entirely
we
can
only
renew
the
oxygen
michel
and
we
must
be
careful
that
the
apparatus
do
not
furnish
us
with
this
oxygen
in
an
immoderate
quantity
for
an
excess
of
it
would
cause
grave
physiological
consequences
but
although
we
can
renew
the
oxygen
we
can
not
renew
the
azote
that
medium
which
the
lungs
do
not
absorb
and
which
ought
to
remain
intact
now
the
azote
would
rapidly
escape
if
the
were
opened
not
just
the
time
necessary
to
throw
poor
satellite
out
agreed
but
we
must
do
it
quickly
and
what
is
the
second
reason
asked
michel
the
second
reason
is
that
we
must
not
allow
the
exterior
cold
which
is
excessive
to
penetrate
into
our
projectile
lest
we
should
be
frozen
alive
still
the
sun
the
sun
warms
our
projectile
because
it
absorbs
its
rays
but
it
does
not
warm
the
void
we
are
in
now
when
there
is
no
air
there
is
no
more
heat
than
there
is
diffused
light
and
where
the
sun
rays
do
not
reach
directly
it
is
both
dark
and
cold
the
temperature
outside
is
only
that
produced
by
the
radiation
of
the
stars
that
is
to
say
the
same
as
the
temperature
of
the
terrestrial
globe
would
be
if
one
day
the
sun
were
to
be
extinguished
no
fear
of
that
answered
nicholl
who
knows
said
michel
ardan
and
even
supposing
that
the
sun
be
not
extinguished
it
might
happen
that
the
earth
will
move
farther
away
from
it
good
said
nicholl
that
one
of
michel
ideas
well
resumed
michel
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
earth
went
through
the
tail
of
a
comet
now
suppose
there
was
a
comet
with
a
power
of
attraction
greater
than
that
of
the
sun
the
terrestrial
globe
might
make
a
curve
towards
the
wandering
star
and
the
earth
would
become
its
satellite
and
would
be
dragged
away
to
such
a
distance
that
the
rays
of
the
sun
would
have
no
action
on
its
surface
that
might
happen
certainly
answered
barbicane
but
the
consequences
would
not
be
so
redoubtable
as
you
would
suppose
how
so
because
heat
and
cold
would
still
be
pretty
well
balanced
upon
our
globe
it
has
been
calculated
that
if
the
earth
had
been
carried
away
by
the
comet
of
it
would
only
have
felt
when
at
its
greatest
distance
from
the
sun
a
heat
sixteen
times
greater
than
that
sent
to
us
by
the
moon
a
heat
which
when
focussed
by
the
strongest
lens
produces
no
appreciable
effect
well
said
michel
wait
a
little
answered
barbicane
it
has
been
calculated
that
at
its
perihelion
when
nearest
to
the
sun
the
earth
would
have
borne
a
heat
equal
to
times
that
of
summer
but
this
heat
capable
of
vitrifying
terrestrial
matters
and
of
evaporating
water
would
have
formed
a
thick
circle
of
clouds
which
would
have
lessened
the
excessive
heat
hence
there
would
be
compensation
between
the
cold
of
the
aphelion
and
the
heat
of
the
perihelion
and
an
average
probably
supportable
at
what
number
of
degrees
do
they
estimate
the
temperature
of
the
planetary
space
formerly
answered
barbicane
it
was
believed
that
this
temperature
was
exceedingly
low
by
calculating
its
thermometric
diminution
it
was
fixed
at
millions
of
degrees
below
zero
it
was
fourier
one
of
countrymen
an
illustrious
of
the
des
who
reduced
these
numbers
to
a
juster
estimation
according
to
him
the
temperature
of
space
does
not
get
lower
than
centigrade
michel
whistled
it
is
about
the
temperature
of
the
polar
regions
answered
barbicane
at
melville
island
or
fort
reliance
about
centigrade
below
zero
it
remains
to
be
proved
said
nicholl
that
fourier
was
not
mistaken
in
his
calculations
if
i
am
not
mistaken
another
frenchman
pouillet
estimates
the
temperature
of
space
at
below
zero
we
shall
be
able
to
verify
that
not
now
answered
barbicane
for
the
solar
rays
striking
directly
upon
our
thermometer
would
give
us
on
the
contrary
a
very
elevated
temperature
but
when
we
get
upon
the
moon
during
the
nights
a
fortnight
long
which
each
of
its
faces
endures
alternately
we
shall
have
leisure
to
make
the
experiment
for
our
satellite
moves
in
the
void
what
do
you
mean
by
the
void
asked
michel
is
it
absolute
void
it
is
absolutely
void
of
air
is
there
nothing
in
its
place
yes
ether
answered
barbicane
ah
and
what
is
ether
ether
my
friend
is
an
agglomeration
of
imponderable
particles
which
relatively
to
their
dimensions
are
as
far
removed
from
each
other
as
the
celestial
bodies
are
in
space
so
say
works
on
molecular
physics
it
is
these
atoms
that
by
their
vibrating
movement
produce
light
and
heat
by
making
four
hundred
and
thirty
billions
of
oscillations
a
second
millions
of
millions
exclaimed
michel
ardan
then
have
measured
and
counted
these
oscillations
all
these
figures
friend
barbicane
are
figures
which
reach
the
ear
but
say
nothing
to
the
mind
but
they
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
figures
no
it
would
be
much
better
to
compare
a
billion
signifies
nothing
an
object
of
comparison
explains
everything
example
when
you
tell
me
that
uranus
is
times
larger
than
the
earth
saturn
times
larger
jupiter
times
larger
the
sun
times
larger
i
am
not
much
wiser
so
i
much
prefer
the
old
comparisons
of
the
that

then
i
know
what
it
means
after
this
tirade
of
michel
ardan
against
and
their
billions
which
he
delivered
without
stopping
to
take
breath
they
set
about
burying
satellite
he
was
to
be
thrown
into
space
like
sailors
throw
a
corpse
into
the
sea
as
president
barbicane
had
recommended
they
had
to
act
quickly
so
as
to
lose
as
little
air
as
possible
the
bolts
upon
the
were
carefully
unscrewed
and
an
opening
of
about
half
a
yard
made
whilst
michel
prepared
to
hurl
his
dog
into
space
the
window
worked
by
a
powerful
lever
which
conquered
the
pressure
of
air
in
the
interior
upon
the
sides
of
the
projectile
moved
upon
its
hinges
and
satellite
was
thrown
out
scarcely
a
particle
of
air
escaped
and
the
operation
succeeded
so
well
that
later
on
barbicane
did
not
fear
to
get
rid
of
all
the
useless
rubbish
that
encumbered
the
vehicle
in
the
same
way
chapter
vi
questions
and
answers
on
the
of
december
at
by
terrestrial
reckoning
the
travellers
awoke
having
been
hours
on
their
journey
they
had
only
been
five
hours
and
forty
minutes
more
than
half
the
time
assigned
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
journey
but
they
had
come
more
than
of
the
distance
this
peculiarity
was
due
to
their
speed
when
they
looked
at
the
earth
through
the
at
the
bottom
it
only
looked
like
a
black
spot
drowned
in
the
sun
rays
no
crescent
or
pale
light
was
now
to
be
seen
the
next
day
at
midnight
the
earth
would
be
new
at
the
precise
moment
when
the
moon
would
be
full
above
the
queen
of
night
was
nearing
the
line
followed
by
the
projectile
so
as
to
meet
it
at
the
hour
indicated
all
around
the
dark
vault
was
studded
with
brilliant
specks
which
seemed
to
move
slowly
but
through
the
great
distance
they
were
at
their
relative
size
did
not
seem
to
alter
much
the
sun
and
the
stars
appeared
exactly
as
they
do
from
the
earth
the
moon
was
considerably
enlarged
but
the
travellers
not
very
powerful
telescopes
did
not
as
yet
allow
them
to
make
very
useful
observations
on
her
surface
or
to
reconnoitre
the
topographical
or
geological
details
the
time
went
by
in
interminable
conversations
the
talk
was
especially
about
the
moon
each
brought
his
contingent
of
particular
knowledge
barbicane
and
nicholl
were
always
serious
michel
ardan
always
fanciful
the
projectile
its
situation
and
direction
the
incidents
that
might
arise
the
precautions
necessitated
by
its
fall
upon
the
moon
all
this
afforded
inexhaustible
material
for
conjecture
whilst
breakfasting
a
question
of
michel
relative
to
the
projectile
provoked
a
rather
curious
answer
from
barbicane
and
one
worthy
of
being
recorded
michel
supposing
the
bullet
to
be
suddenly
stopped
whilst
still
endowed
with
its
formidable
initial
velocity
wished
to
know
what
the
consequences
would
have
been
but
answered
barbicane
i
do
see
how
the
projectile
could
have
been
stopped
but
let
us
suppose
it
answered
nicholl
it
is
an
impossible
supposition
replied
the
practical
president
unless
the
force
of
impulsion
had
failed
but
in
that
case
its
speed
would
have
gradually
decreased
and
would
not
have
stopped
abruptly
admit
that
it
had
struck
against
some
body
in
space
what
body
the
enormous
meteor
we
met
then
said
nicholl
the
projectile
would
have
been
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
we
with
it
more
than
that
answered
barbicane
we
should
have
been
burnt
alive
burnt
exclaimed
michel
i
regret
it
did
not
happen
for
us
just
to
see
and
you
would
have
seen
with
a
vengeance
answered
barbicane
it
is
now
known
that
heat
is
only
a
modification
of
movement
when
water
is
heated
that
is
to
say
when
heat
is
added
to
it
that
means
the
giving
of
movement
to
its
particles
that
is
an
ingenious
theory
said
michel
and
a
correct
one
my
worthy
friend
for
it
explains
all
the
phenomena
of
caloric
heat
is
only
molecular
movement
a
single
oscillation
of
the
particles
of
a
body
when
the
break
is
put
on
a
train
it
stops
but
what
becomes
of
the
movement
which
animated
it
why
do
they
grease
the
axles
of
the
wheels
in
order
to
prevent
them
catching
fire
from
the
movement
lost
by
transformation
do
you
understand
admirably
answered
michel
for
example
when
i
have
been
running
some
time
and
am
covered
with
sweat
why
am
i
forced
to
stop
simply
because
my
movement
has
been
transformed
into
heat
barbicane
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
of
michel
then
resuming
his
theory
thus
said
he
in
case
of
a
collision
it
would
have
happened
to
our
projectile
as
it
does
to
the
metal
after
striking
it
would
fall
burning
because
its
movement
had
been
transformed
into
heat
in
consequence
i
affirm
that
if
our
bullet
had
struck
against
the
asteroid
its
speed
suddenly
annihilated
would
have
produced
heat
enough
to
turn
it
immediately
into
vapour
then
asked
nicholl
what
would
happen
if
the
earth
were
to
be
suddenly
stopped
in
her
movement
of
translation
her
temperature
would
be
carried
to
such
a
point
answered
barbicane
that
she
would
be
immediately
reduced
to
vapour
good
said
michel
that
means
of
ending
the
world
would
simplify
many
things
and
suppose
the
earth
were
to
fall
upon
the
sun
said
nicholl
according
to
calculations
answered
barbicane
that
would
develop
a
heat
equal
to
that
produced
by
globes
of
coal
equal
in
volume
to
the
terrestrial
globe
a
good
increase
of
temperature
for
the
sun
replied
michel
ardan
of
which
the
inhabitants
of
uranus
or
neptune
will
probably
not
complain
for
they
must
be
dying
of
cold
on
their
planet
thus
then
my
friends
any
movement
suddenly
stopped
produces
heat
this
theory
makes
it
supposed
that
the
sun
is
constantly
fed
by
an
incessant
fall
of
bodies
upon
its
surface
it
has
been
calculated
now
i
shall
be
crushed
murmured
michel
for
figures
are
coming
it
has
been
calculated
continued
barbicane
imperturbably
that
the
shock
of
each
asteroid
upon
the
sun
must
produce
heat
equal
to
that
of
masses
of
coal
of
equal
volume
and
what
is
the
heat
of
the
sun
asked
michel
it
is
equal
to
that
which
would
be
produced
by
a
stratum
of
coal
surrounding
the
sun
to
a
depth
of
kilometres
and
that
heat
could
boil
of
cubic
myriametres
of
water
an
hour
a
myriametre
is
equal
to
rather
more
than
miles
or
miles
furlong
poles
and
we
are
not
roasted
by
it
cried
michel
no
answered
barbicane
because
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
absorbs
of
the
solar
heat
besides
the
quantity
of
heat
intercepted
by
the
earth
is
only
two
thousand
millionth
of
the
total
i
see
that
all
is
for
the
best
replied
michel
and
that
our
atmosphere
is
a
useful
invention
for
it
not
only
allows
us
to
breathe
but
actually
prevents
us
roasting
yes
said
nicholl
but
unfortunately
it
will
not
be
the
same
on
the
moon
bah
said
michel
always
confident
if
there
are
any
inhabitants
they
breathe
if
there
are
no
longer
any
they
will
surely
have
left
enough
oxygen
for
three
people
if
only
at
the
bottom
of
those
ravines
where
it
will
have
accumulated
by
reason
of
its
weight
well
we
shall
not
climb
the
mountains
that
is
all
and
michel
getting
up
went
to
look
at
the
lunar
disc
which
was
shining
with
intolerable
brilliancy
faith
said
he
it
must
be
hot
up
there
without
reckoning
answered
nicholl
that
daylight
lasts
hours
and
by
way
of
compensation
night
has
the
same
duration
said
barbicane
and
as
heat
is
restored
by
radiation
their
temperature
must
be
that
of
planetary
space
a
fine
country
truly
said
nicholl
never
mind
i
should
like
to
be
there
already
it
will
be
comical
to
have
the
earth
for
a
moon
to
see
it
rise
on
the
horizon
to
recognise
the
configuration
of
its
continents
to
say
to
oneself
america
and
there
europe
then
to
follow
it
till
it
is
lost
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
barbicane
have
the
selenites
any
eclipses
yes
eclipses
of
the
sun
answered
barbicane
when
the
centres
of
the
three
stars
are
on
the
same
line
with
the
earth
in
the
middle
but
they
are
merely
annular
eclipses
during
which
the
earth
thrown
like
a
screen
across
the
solar
disc
allows
the
greater
part
to
be
seen
why
is
there
no
total
eclipse
asked
nicholl
is
it
because
the
cone
of
shade
thrown
by
the
earth
does
not
extend
beyond
the
moon
yes
if
you
do
not
take
into
account
the
refraction
produced
by
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
not
if
you
do
take
that
refraction
into
account
thus
let
be
the
horizontal
parallax
and
the
apparent
semidiameter
ouf
said
michel
half
of
zero
square
do
speak
the
vulgar
tongue
man
of
algebra
well
then
in
popular
language
answered
barbicane
the
mean
distance
between
the
moon
and
the
earth
being
sixty
terrestrial
radii
the
length
of
the
cone
of
shadow
by
dint
of
refraction
is
reduced
to
less
than
radii
it
follows
therefore
that
during
the
eclipses
the
moon
is
beyond
the
cone
of
pure
shade
and
the
sun
sends
it
not
only
rays
from
its
edges
but
also
rays
from
its
centre
then
said
michel
in
a
grumbling
tone
why
is
there
any
eclipse
when
there
ought
to
be
none
solely
because
the
solar
rays
are
weakened
by
the
refraction
and
the
atmosphere
which
they
traverse
extinguishes
the
greater
part
of
them
that
reason
satisfies
me
answered
michel
besides
we
shall
see
for
ourselves
when
we
get
there
now
barbicane
do
you
believe
that
the
moon
is
an
ancient
comet
what
an
idea
yes
replied
michel
with
amiable
conceit
i
have
a
few
ideas
of
that
kind
but
that
idea
does
not
originate
with
michel
answered
nicholl
then
i
am
only
a
plagiarist
without
doubt
answered
nicholl
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
ancients
the
arcadians
pretended
that
their
ancestors
inhabited
the
earth
before
the
moon
became
her
satellite
starting
from
this
fact
certain
think
the
moon
was
a
comet
which
its
orbit
one
day
brought
near
enough
to
the
earth
to
be
retained
by
terrestrial
attraction
and
what
truth
is
there
in
that
hypothesis
asked
michel
none
answered
barbicane
and
the
proof
is
that
the
moon
has
not
kept
a
trace
of
the
gaseous
envelope
that
always
accompanies
comets
but
said
nicholl
might
not
the
moon
before
becoming
the
satellite
have
passed
near
enough
to
the
sun
to
leave
all
her
gaseous
substances
by
evaporation
it
might
friend
nicholl
but
it
is
not
probable
why
because
because
i
really
do
know
ah
what
hundreds
of
volumes
we
might
fill
with
what
we
do
know
exclaimed
michel
but
i
say
he
continued
what
time
is
it
three
answered
nicholl
how
the
time
goes
said
michel
in
the
conversation
of
like
us
decidedly
i
feel
myself
getting
too
learned
i
feel
that
i
am
becoming
a
well
of
knowledge
so
saying
michel
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
projectile
in
order
better
to
observe
the
moon
he
pretended
in
the
meanwhile
his
companions
watched
the
vault
of
space
through
the
lower
there
was
nothing
fresh
to
signalise
when
michel
ardan
came
down
again
he
approached
the
lateral
and
suddenly
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
what
is
the
matter
now
asked
barbicane
the
president
approached
the
glass
and
saw
a
sort
of
flattened
sack
floating
outside
at
some
yards
distance
from
the
projectile
this
object
seemed
motionless
like
the
bullet
and
was
consequently
animated
with
the
same
ascensional
movement
whatever
can
that
machine
be
said
michel
ardan
is
it
one
of
the
corpuscles
of
space
which
our
projectile
holds
in
its
radius
of
attraction
and
which
will
accompany
it
as
far
as
the
moon
what
i
am
astonished
at
answered
nicholl
is
that
the
specific
weight
of
this
body
which
is
certainly
superior
to
that
of
the
bullet
allows
it
to
maintain
itself
so
rigorously
on
its
level
nicholl
said
barbicane
after
a
moment
reflection
i
do
not
know
what
that
object
is
but
i
know
perfectly
why
it
keeps
on
a
level
with
the
projectile
why
pray
because
we
are
floating
in
the
void
where
bodies
fall
or
move
which
is
the
same
thing
with
equal
speed
whatever
their
weight
or
form
may
be
it
is
the
air
which
by
its
resistance
creates
differences
in
weight
when
you
pneumatically
create
void
in
a
tube
the
objects
you
throw
down
it
either
lead
or
feathers
fall
with
the
same
rapidity
here
in
space
you
have
the
same
cause
and
the
same
effect
true
said
nicholl
and
all
we
throw
out
of
the
projectile
will
accompany
us
to
the
moon
ah
what
fools
we
are
cried
michel
why
this
qualification
asked
barbicane
because
we
ought
to
have
filled
the
projectile
with
useful
objects
books
instruments
tools
we
could
have
thrown
them
all
out
and
they
would
all
have
followed
in
our
wake
but
now
i
think
of
it
why
ca
we
take
a
walk
outside
this
why
ca
we
go
into
space
through
the
what
delight
it
would
be
to
be
thus
suspended
in
ether
more
favoured
even
than
birds
that
are
forced
to
flap
their
wings
to
sustain
them
agreed
said
barbicane
but
how
are
we
to
breathe
confounded
air
to
fail
so
inopportunely
but
if
it
did
not
fail
michel
your
density
being
inferior
to
that
of
the
projectile
you
would
soon
remain
behind
then
it
is
a
vicious
circle
all
that
is
most
vicious
and
we
must
remain
imprisoned
in
our
vehicle
yes
we
must
ah
cried
michel
in
a
formidable
voice
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
nicholl
i
know
i
guess
what
this
pretended
asteroid
is
it
is
not
a
broken
piece
of
planet
what
is
it
then
asked
nicholl
it
is
our
unfortunate
dog
it
is
diana
husband
in
fact
this
deformed
object
reduced
to
nothing
and
quite
unrecognisable
was
the
body
of
satellite
flattened
like
a
bagpipe
without
wind
and
mounting
for
ever
mounting
chapter
vii
a
moment
of
intoxication
thus
a
curious
but
logical
strange
yet
logical
phenomenon
took
place
under
these
singular
conditions
every
object
thrown
out
of
the
projectile
would
follow
the
same
trajectory
and
only
stop
when
it
did
that
furnished
a
text
for
conversation
which
the
whole
evening
could
not
exhaust
the
emotion
of
the
three
travellers
increased
as
they
approached
the
end
of
their
journey
they
expected
unforeseen
incidents
fresh
phenomena
and
nothing
would
have
astonished
them
under
present
circumstances
their
excited
imagination
outdistanced
the
projectile
the
speed
of
which
diminished
notably
without
their
feeling
it
but
the
moon
grew
larger
before
their
eyes
and
they
thought
they
had
only
to
stretch
out
their
hands
to
touch
it
the
next
day
the
of
december
they
were
all
wide
awake
at
that
day
was
to
be
the
last
of
their
journey
if
the
calculations
were
exact
that
same
evening
at
midnight
within
eighteen
hours
at
the
precise
moment
of
full
moon
they
would
reach
her
brilliant
disc
the
next
midnight
would
bring
them
to
the
goal
of
their
journey
the
most
extraordinary
one
of
ancient
or
modern
times
at
early
dawn
through
the
windows
made
silvery
with
her
rays
they
saluted
the
queen
of
night
with
a
confident
and
joyful
hurrah
the
moon
was
sailing
majestically
across
the
starry
firmament
a
few
more
degrees
and
she
would
reach
that
precise
point
in
space
where
the
projectile
was
to
meet
her
according
to
his
own
observations
barbicane
thought
that
he
should
accost
her
in
her
northern
hemisphere
where
vast
plains
extend
and
mountains
are
rare
a
favourable
circumstance
if
the
lunar
atmosphere
was
according
to
received
opinion
stored
up
in
deep
places
only
besides
observed
michel
ardan
a
plain
is
more
suitable
for
landing
upon
than
a
mountain
a
selenite
landed
in
europe
on
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
or
in
asia
on
a
peak
of
the
himalayas
would
not
be
precisely
at
his
destination
what
is
more
added
nicholl
on
a
plain
the
projectile
will
remain
motionless
after
it
has
touched
the
ground
whilst
it
would
roll
down
a
hill
like
an
avalanche
and
as
we
are
not
squirrels
we
should
not
come
out
safe
and
sound
therefore
all
is
for
the
best
in
fact
the
success
of
the
audacious
enterprise
no
longer
appeared
doubtful
still
one
reflection
occupied
barbicane
but
not
wishing
to
make
his
two
companions
uneasy
he
kept
silence
upon
it
the
direction
of
the
projectile
towards
the
northern
hemisphere
proved
that
its
trajectory
had
been
slightly
modified
the
aim
mathematically
calculated
ought
to
have
sent
the
bullet
into
the
very
centre
of
the
lunar
disc
if
it
did
not
arrive
there
it
would
be
because
it
had
deviated
what
had
caused
it
barbicane
could
not
imagine
nor
determine
the
importance
of
this
deviation
for
there
was
no
datum
to
go
upon
he
hoped
however
that
the
only
result
would
be
to
take
them
towards
the
upper
edge
of
the
moon
a
more
suitable
region
for
landing
barbicane
therefore
without
saying
anything
to
his
friends
contented
himself
with
frequently
observing
the
moon
trying
to
see
if
the
direction
of
the
projectile
would
not
change
for
the
situation
would
have
been
so
terrible
had
the
bullet
missing
its
aim
been
dragged
beyond
the
lunar
disc
and
fallen
into
interplanetary
space
at
that
moment
the
moon
instead
of
appearing
flat
like
a
disc
already
showed
her
convexity
if
the
sun
rays
had
reached
her
obliquely
the
shadow
then
thrown
would
have
made
the
high
mountains
stand
out
they
could
have
seen
the
gaping
craters
and
the
capricious
furrows
that
cut
up
the
immense
plains
but
all
relief
was
levelled
in
the
intense
brilliancy
those
large
spots
that
give
the
appearance
of
a
human
face
to
the
moon
were
scarcely
distinguishable
it
may
be
a
face
said
michel
ardan
but
i
am
sorry
for
the
amiable
sister
of
apollo
her
face
is
so
freckled
in
the
meantime
the
travellers
so
near
their
goal
ceaselessly
watched
this
new
world
their
imagination
made
them
take
walks
over
these
unknown
countries
they
climbed
the
elevated
peaks
they
descended
to
the
bottom
of
the
large
amphitheatres
here
and
there
they
thought
they
saw
vast
seas
scarcely
kept
together
under
an
atmosphere
so
rarefied
and
streams
of
water
that
poured
them
their
tribute
from
the
mountains
leaning
over
the
abyss
they
hoped
to
catch
the
noise
of
this
orb
for
ever
mute
in
the
solitudes
of
the
void
this
last
day
left
them
the
liveliest
remembrances
they
noted
down
the
least
details
a
vague
uneasiness
took
possession
of
them
as
they
approached
their
goal
this
uneasiness
would
have
been
doubled
if
they
had
felt
how
slight
their
speed
was
it
appeared
quite
insufficient
to
take
them
to
the
end
of
their
journey
this
was
because
the
projectile
scarcely
weighed
anything
its
weight
constantly
decreased
and
would
be
entirely
annihilated
on
that
line
where
the
lunar
and
terrestrial
attractions
neutralise
each
other
causing
surprising
effects
nevertheless
in
spite
of
his
preoccupations
michel
ardan
did
not
forget
to
prepare
the
morning
meal
with
his
habitual
punctuality
they
ate
heartily
nothing
was
more
excellent
than
their
broth
liquefied
by
the
heat
of
the
gas
nothing
better
than
these
preserved
meats
a
few
glasses
of
good
french
wine
crowned
the
repast
and
caused
michel
ardan
to
remark
that
the
lunar
vines
warmed
by
this
ardent
sun
ought
to
distil
the
most
generous
wines
that
is
if
they
existed
any
way
the
frenchman
had
taken
care
not
to
forget
in
his
collection
some
precious
cuttings
of
the
m√©doc
and
c√¥te
upon
which
he
counted
particularly
the
reiset
and
regnault
apparatus
always
worked
with
extreme
precision
the
air
was
kept
in
a
state
of
perfect
purity
not
a
particle
of
carbonic
acid
resisted
the
potash
and
as
to
the
oxygen
that
as
captain
nicholl
said
was
of
first
quality
the
small
amount
of
humidity
in
the
projectile
mixed
with
this
air
and
tempered
its
dryness
and
many
paris
london
or
new
york
apartments
and
many
theatres
do
not
certainly
fulfil
hygienic
conditions
so
well
but
in
order
to
work
regularly
this
apparatus
had
to
be
kept
going
regularly
each
morning
michel
inspected
the
escape
regulators
tried
the
taps
and
fixed
by
the
pyrometer
the
heat
of
the
gas
all
had
gone
well
so
far
and
the
travellers
imitating
the
worthy
maston
began
to
get
so
stout
that
they
would
not
be
recognisable
if
their
imprisonment
lasted
several
months
they
behaved
like
chickens
in
a
cage
they
fattened
looking
through
the
port
lights
barbicane
saw
the
spectre
of
the
dog
and
the
different
objects
thrown
out
of
the
projectile
which
obstinately
accompanied
it
diana
howled
lamentably
when
she
perceived
the
remains
of
satellite
all
the
things
seemed
as
motionless
as
if
they
had
rested
upon
solid
ground
do
you
know
my
friends
said
michel
ardan
that
if
one
of
us
had
succumbed
to
the
recoil
shock
at
departure
we
should
have
been
much
embarrassed
as
to
how
to
get
rid
of
him
you
see
the
accusing
corpse
would
have
followed
us
in
space
like
remorse
that
would
have
been
sad
said
nicholl
ah
continued
michel
what
i
regret
is
our
not
being
able
to
take
a
walk
outside
what
delight
it
would
be
to
float
in
this
radiant
ether
to
bathe
in
these
pure
rays
of
the
sun
if
barbicane
had
only
thought
of
furnishing
us
with
and
i
should
have
ventured
outside
and
have
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
on
the
summit
of
the
projectile
ah
old
fellow
answered
barbicane
you
would
not
have
stayed
there
long
in
spite
of
your
you
would
have
burst
like
an
obus
by
the
expansion
of
air
inside
you
or
rather
like
a
balloon
that
goes
up
too
high
so
regret
nothing
and
do
not
forget
this
while
we
are
moving
in
the
void
you
must
do
without
any
sentimental
promenade
out
of
the
projectile
michel
ardan
allowed
himself
to
be
convinced
in
a
certain
measure
he
agreed
that
the
thing
was
difficult
but
not
impossible
that
was
a
word
he
never
uttered
the
conversation
passed
from
this
subject
to
another
and
never
languished
an
instant
it
seemed
to
the
three
friends
that
under
these
conditions
ideas
came
into
their
heads
like
leaves
in
the
first
warm
days
of
spring
amidst
the
questions
and
answers
that
crossed
each
other
during
this
morning
nicholl
asked
one
that
did
not
get
an
immediate
solution
i
say
said
he
it
is
all
very
well
to
go
to
the
moon
but
how
shall
we
get
back
again
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nicholl
asked
barbicane
gravely
it
seems
to
me
very
inopportune
to
ask
about
getting
away
from
a
country
before
you
get
to
it
added
michel
i
do
ask
that
question
because
i
want
to
draw
back
but
i
repeat
my
question
and
ask
shall
we
get
back
i
have
not
the
least
idea
answered
barbicane
and
as
for
me
said
michel
if
i
had
known
how
to
come
back
i
should
not
have
gone
that
is
what
you
call
answering
cried
nicholl
i
approve
of
michel
words
and
add
that
the
question
has
no
actual
interest
we
will
think
about
that
later
on
when
we
want
to
return
though
the
columbiad
will
not
be
there
the
projectile
will
much
good
that
will
be
a
bullet
without
a
gun
a
gun
can
be
made
and
so
can
powder
neither
metal
saltpetre
nor
coal
can
be
wanting
in
the
bowels
of
the
moon
besides
in
order
to
return
you
have
only
the
lunar
attraction
to
conquer
and
you
will
only
have
leagues
to
go
so
as
to
fall
on
the
terrestrial
globe
by
the
simple
laws
of
weight
that
is
enough
said
michel
getting
animated
let
us
hear
no
more
about
returning
as
to
communicating
with
our
ancient
colleagues
upon
earth
that
will
not
be
difficult
how
are
we
to
do
that
pray
by
means
of
meteors
hurled
by
the
lunar
volcanoes
a
good
idea
michel
answered
barbicane
laplace
has
calculated
that
a
force
five
times
superior
to
that
of
our
cannons
would
suffice
to
send
a
meteor
from
the
moon
to
the
earth
now
there
is
no
volcano
that
has
not
a
superior
force
of
propulsion
hurrah
cried
michel
meteors
will
be
convenient
postmen
and
will
not
cost
anything
and
how
we
shall
laugh
at
the
postal
service
but
now
i
think
what
do
you
think
a
superb
idea
why
did
we
not
fasten
a
telegraph
wire
to
our
bullet
we
could
have
exchanged
telegrams
with
the
earth
and
the
weight
of
a
wire
leagues
long
answered
nicholl
does
that
go
for
nothing
yes
for
nothing
we
should
have
trebled
the
charge
of
the
columbiad
we
could
have
made
it
four
times
five
times
greater
cried
michel
whose
voice
became
more
and
more
violent
there
is
a
slight
objection
to
make
to
your
project
answered
barbicane
it
is
that
during
the
movement
of
rotation
of
the
globe
our
wire
would
have
been
rolled
round
it
like
a
chain
round
a
windlass
and
it
would
inevitably
have
dragged
us
down
to
the
earth
again
by
the
stars
of
the
union
said
michel
i
have
nothing
but
impracticable
ideas
ideas
worthy
of
maston
but
now
i
think
of
it
if
we
do
not
return
to
earth
maston
will
certainly
come
to
us
yes
he
will
come
replied
barbicane
he
is
a
worthy
and
courageous
comrade
besides
what
could
be
easier
is
not
the
columbiad
still
lying
in
floridian
soil
is
cotton
and
nitric
acid
wanting
wherewith
to
manufacture
the
projectile
will
not
the
moon
again
pass
the
zenith
of
florida
in
another
eighteen
years
will
she
not
occupy
exactly
the
same
place
that
she
occupies
yes
repeated
michel
yes
maston
will
come
and
with
him
our
friends
elphinstone
blomsberry
and
all
the
members
of
the
gun
club
and
they
will
be
welcome
later
on
trains
of
projectiles
will
be
established
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
hurrah
for
maston
it
is
probable
that
if
the
honourable
maston
did
not
hear
the
hurrahs
uttered
in
his
honour
his
ears
tingled
at
least
what
was
he
doing
then
he
was
no
doubt
stationed
in
the
rocky
mountains
at
peak
trying
to
discover
the
invisible
bullet
gravitating
in
space
if
he
was
thinking
of
his
dear
companions
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
they
were
not
behindhand
with
him
and
that
under
the
influence
of
singular
exaltation
they
consecrated
their
best
thoughts
to
him
but
whence
came
the
animation
that
grew
visibly
greater
in
the
inhabitants
of
the
projectile
their
sobriety
could
not
be
questioned
must
this
strange
erethismus
of
the
brain
be
attributed
to
the
exceptional
circumstances
of
the
time
to
that
proximity
of
the
queen
of
night
from
which
a
few
hours
only
separated
them
or
to
some
secret
influence
of
the
moon
acting
on
their
nervous
system
their
faces
became
as
red
as
if
exposed
to
the
reverberation
of
a
furnace
their
respiration
became
more
active
and
their
lungs
played
like
their
eyes
shone
with
extraordinary
flame
and
their
voices
became
formidably
loud
their
words
escaped
like
a
driven
forth
by
carbonic
acid
gas
their
gestures
became
disquieting
they
wanted
so
much
room
to
perform
them
in
and
strange
to
say
they
in
no
wise
perceived
this
excessive
tension
of
the
mind
now
said
nicholl
in
a
sharp
tone
now
that
i
do
not
know
whether
we
shall
come
back
from
the
moon
i
will
know
what
we
are
going
there
for
what
we
are
going
there
for
answered
barbicane
stamping
as
if
he
were
in
a
i
do
know
you
do
know
cried
michel
with
a
shout
that
provoked
a
sonorous
echo
in
the
projectile
no
i
have
not
the
least
idea
answered
barbicane
shouting
in
unison
with
his
interlocutor
well
then
i
know
answered
michel
speak
then
said
nicholl
who
could
no
longer
restrain
the
angry
tones
of
his
voice
i
shall
speak
if
it
suits
me
cried
michel
violently
seizing
his
companion
arm
it
must
suit
you
said
barbicane
with
eyes
on
fire
and
threatening
hands
it
was
you
who
drew
us
into
this
terrible
journey
and
we
wish
to
know
why
yes
said
the
captain
now
i
do
know
where
i
am
going
i
will
know
why
i
am
going
why
cried
michel
jumping
a
yard
high
why
to
take
possession
of
the
moon
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
add
a
fortieth
state
to
the
union
to
colonise
the
lunar
regions
to
cultivate
them
people
them
to
take
them
all
the
wonders
of
art
science
and
industry
to
civilise
the
selenites
unless
they
are
more
civilised
than
we
are
and
to
make
them
into
a
republic
if
they
have
not
already
done
it
for
themselves
if
there
are
any
selenites
answered
nicholl
who
under
the
empire
of
this
inexplicable
intoxication
became
very
contradictory
who
says
there
are
no
selenites
cried
michel
in
a
threatening
tone
i
do
shouted
nicholl
captain
said
michel
do
not
repeat
that
insult
or
i
will
knock
your
teeth
down
your
throat
the
two
adversaries
were
about
to
rush
upon
one
another
and
this
incoherent
discussion
was
threatening
to
degenerate
into
a
battle
when
barbicane
interfered
stop
unhappy
men
said
he
putting
his
two
companions
back
to
back
if
there
are
no
selenites
we
will
do
without
them
yes
exclaimed
michel
who
did
not
care
more
about
them
than
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
selenites
bother
the
selenites
the
empire
of
the
moon
shall
be
ours
said
nicholl
let
us
found
a
republic
of
three
i
shall
be
the
congress
cried
michel
and
i
the
senate
answered
nicholl
and
barbicane
the
president
shouted
michel
no
president
elected
by
the
nation
answered
barbicane
well
then
a
president
elected
by
the
congress
exclaimed
michel
and
as
i
am
the
congress
i
elect
you
unanimously
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
for
president
barbicane
exclaimed
nicholl
hip
hip
hip
hurrah
vociferated
michel
ardan
then
the
president
and
senate
struck
up
yankee
doodle
as
loudly
as
they
could
whilst
the
congress
shouted
the
virile
marseillaise
then
began
a
frantic
dance
with
maniacal
gestures
mad
stamping
and
somersaults
of
boneless
clowns
diana
took
part
in
the
dance
howling
too
and
jumped
to
the
very
roof
of
the
projectile
an
inexplicable
flapping
of
wings
and
of
singular
sonority
were
heard
five
or
six
fowls
flew
about
striking
the
walls
like
mad
bats
then
the
three
travelling
companions
whose
lungs
were
disorganised
under
some
incomprehensible
influence
more
than
intoxicated
burnt
by
the
air
that
had
set
their
breathing
apparatus
on
fire
fell
motionless
upon
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
chapter
viii
at
thousand
one
hundred
and
fourteen
leagues
what
had
happened
what
was
the
cause
of
that
singular
intoxication
the
consequences
of
which
might
prove
so
disastrous
simply
carelessness
on
michel
part
which
nicholl
was
able
to
remedy
in
time
after
a
veritable
swoon
which
lasted
a
few
minutes
the
captain
who
was
the
first
to
regain
consciousness
soon
collected
his
intellectual
faculties
although
he
had
breakfasted
two
hours
before
he
began
to
feel
as
hungry
as
if
he
had
not
tasted
food
for
several
days
his
whole
being
his
brain
and
stomach
were
excited
to
the
highest
point
he
rose
therefore
and
demanded
a
supplementary
collation
from
michel
who
was
still
unconscious
and
did
not
answer
nicholl
therefore
proceeded
to
prepare
some
cups
of
tea
in
order
to
facilitate
the
absorption
of
a
dozen
sandwiches
he
busied
himself
first
with
lighting
a
fire
and
so
struck
a
match
what
was
his
surprise
to
see
the
sulphur
burn
with
extraordinary
and
almost
unbearable
brilliancy
from
the
jet
of
gas
he
lighted
rose
a
flame
equal
to
floods
of
electric
light
a
revelation
took
place
in
nicholl
mind
this
intensity
of
light
the
physiological
disturbance
in
himself
the
extra
excitement
of
all
his
moral
and
sensitive
faculties
he
understood
it
all
the
oxygen
he
exclaimed
and
leaning
over
the
he
saw
that
the
tap
was
giving
out
a
flood
of
colourless
savourless
and
odourless
gas
eminently
vital
but
which
in
a
pure
state
produces
the
gravest
disorders
in
the
constitution
through
carelessness
michel
had
left
the
tap
full
on
nicholl
made
haste
to
turn
off
this
flow
of
oxygen
with
which
the
atmosphere
was
saturated
and
which
would
have
caused
the
death
of
the
travellers
not
by
suffocation
but
by
combustion
an
hour
afterwards
the
air
was
relieved
and
gave
their
normal
play
to
the
lungs
by
degrees
the
three
friends
recovered
from
their
intoxication
but
they
were
obliged
to
recover
from
their
oxygen
like
a
drunkard
from
his
wine
when
michel
knew
his
share
of
responsibility
in
this
incident
he
did
not
appear
in
the
least
disconcerted
this
unexpected
intoxication
broke
the
monotony
of
the
journey
many
foolish
things
had
been
said
under
its
influence
but
they
had
been
forgotten
as
soon
as
said
then
added
the
merry
frenchman
i
am
not
sorry
for
having
experienced
the
effect
of
this
captious
gas
do
you
know
my
friends
that
there
might
be
a
curious
establishment
set
up
with
where
people
whose
constitutions
are
weak
might
live
a
more
active
life
during
a
few
hours
at
least
suppose
we
had
meetings
where
the
air
could
be
saturated
with
this
heroic
fluid
theatres
where
the
managers
would
send
it
out
in
strong
doses
what
passion
there
would
be
in
the
souls
of
actors
and
spectators
what
fire
and
what
enthusiasm
and
if
instead
of
a
simple
assembly
a
whole
nation
could
be
saturated
with
it
what
activity
what
a
supplement
of
life
it
would
receive
of
an
exhausted
nation
it
perhaps
would
make
a
great
and
strong
nation
and
i
know
more
than
one
state
in
old
europe
that
ought
to
put
itself
under
the
oxygen
in
the
interest
of
its
health
michel
spoke
with
as
much
animation
as
if
the
tap
were
still
full
on
but
with
one
sentence
barbicane
damped
his
enthusiasm
all
that
is
very
well
friend
michel
he
said
but
now
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
where
those
fowls
that
joined
in
our
concert
came
from
those
fowls
yes
in
fact
hens
and
a
superb
cock
were
flying
hither
and
thither
ah
the
stupids
cried
michel
it
was
the
oxygen
that
put
them
in
revolt
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
fowls
asked
barbicane
acclimatise
them
in
the
moon
of
course
for
the
sake
of
a
joke
my
worthy
president
simply
a
joke
that
has
unhappily
come
to
nothing
i
wanted
to
let
them
out
on
the
lunar
continent
without
telling
you
how
astounded
you
would
have
been
to
see
these
terrestrial
poultry
pecking
the
fields
of
the
moon
ah
you
eternal
boy
answered
barbicane
you
do
want
oxygen
to
make
you
out
of
your
senses
you
are
always
what
we
were
under
the
influence
of
this
gas
you
are
always
insane
ah
how
do
we
know
we
were
not
wiser
then
replied
michel
ardan
after
this
philosophical
reflection
the
three
friends
repaired
the
disorder
in
the
projectile
cock
and
hens
were
put
back
in
their
cage
but
as
they
were
doing
this
barbicane
and
his
two
companions
distinctly
perceived
a
fresh
phenomenon
since
the
moment
they
had
left
the
earth
their
own
weight
that
of
the
bullet
and
the
objects
it
contained
had
suffered
progressive
diminution
though
they
could
not
have
any
experience
of
this
in
the
projectile
a
moment
must
come
when
the
effect
upon
themselves
and
the
tools
and
instruments
they
used
would
be
felt
of
course
scales
would
not
have
indicated
this
loss
of
weight
for
the
weights
used
would
have
lost
precisely
as
much
as
the
object
itself
but
a
spring
the
tension
of
which
is
independent
of
attraction
would
have
given
the
exact
valuation
of
this
diminution
it
is
well
known
that
attraction
or
weight
is
in
proportion
to
the
bulk
and
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
distances
hence
this
consequence
if
the
earth
had
been
alone
in
space
if
the
other
heavenly
bodies
were
to
be
suddenly
annihilated
the
projectile
according
to
newton
law
would
have
weighed
less
according
to
its
distance
from
the
earth
but
without
ever
losing
its
weight
entirely
for
the
terrestrial
attraction
would
always
have
made
itself
felt
no
matter
at
what
distance
but
in
the
case
with
which
we
are
dealing
a
moment
must
come
when
the
projectile
would
not
be
at
all
under
the
law
of
gravitation
after
allowing
for
the
other
celestial
bodies
whose
effect
could
not
be
set
down
as
zero
in
fact
the
trajectory
of
the
projectile
was
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
as
it
went
farther
away
from
the
earth
terrestrial
attraction
would
be
diminished
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
distances
but
the
lunar
attraction
would
be
augmented
in
the
same
proportion
a
point
must
therefore
be
reached
where
these
two
attractions
would
neutralise
each
other
and
the
bullet
would
have
no
weight
at
all
if
the
volumes
of
the
moon
and
earth
were
equal
this
point
would
have
been
reached
at
an
equal
distance
between
the
two
bodies
but
by
taking
their
difference
of
bulk
into
account
it
was
easy
to
calculate
that
this
point
would
be
situated
at
of
the
journey
or
at
leagues
from
the
earth
at
this
point
a
body
that
had
no
principle
of
velocity
or
movement
in
itself
would
remain
eternally
motionless
being
equally
attracted
by
the
two
heavenly
bodies
and
nothing
drawing
it
more
towards
one
than
the
other
now
if
the
force
of
impulsion
had
been
exactly
calculated
the
projectile
ought
to
reach
that
point
with
no
velocity
having
lost
all
weight
like
the
objects
it
contained
what
would
happen
then
three
hypotheses
presented
themselves
either
the
projectile
would
have
kept
some
velocity
and
passing
the
point
of
equal
attraction
would
fall
on
the
moon
by
virtue
of
the
excess
of
lunar
attraction
over
terrestrial
attraction
or
velocity
sufficient
to
reach
the
neutral
point
being
wanting
it
would
fall
back
on
the
earth
by
virtue
of
the
excess
of
terrestrial
attraction
over
lunar
attraction
or
lastly
endowed
with
sufficient
velocity
to
reach
the
neutral
point
but
insufficient
to
pass
it
it
would
remain
eternally
suspended
in
the
same
place
like
the
pretended
coffin
of
mahomet
between
the
zenith
and
nadir
such
was
the
situation
and
barbicane
clearly
explained
the
consequences
to
his
travelling
companions
they
were
interested
to
the
highest
degree
how
were
they
to
know
when
they
had
reached
this
neutral
point
situated
at
leagues
from
the
earth
at
the
precise
moment
when
neither
they
nor
the
objects
contained
in
the
projectile
should
be
in
any
way
subject
to
the
laws
of
weight
until
now
the
travellers
though
they
had
remarked
that
this
action
diminished
little
by
little
had
not
yet
perceived
its
total
absence
but
that
day
about
nicholl
having
let
a
tumbler
escape
from
his
hand
instead
of
falling
it
remained
suspended
in
the
air
ah
cried
michel
ardan
this
is
a
little
amusing
chemistry
and
immediately
different
objects
weapons
bottles
c
left
to
themselves
hung
suspended
as
if
by
miracle
diana
too
lifted
up
by
michel
into
space
reproduced
but
without
trickery
the
marvellous
suspensions
effected
by
and
maskelyne
and
cook
the
three
adventurous
companions
surprised
and
stupefied
in
spite
of
their
scientific
reasoning
carried
into
the
domain
of
the
marvellous
felt
weight
go
out
of
their
bodies
when
they
stretched
out
their
arms
they
felt
no
inclination
to
drop
them
their
heads
vacillated
on
their
shoulders
their
feet
no
longer
kept
at
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
they
were
like
staggering
drunkards
imagination
has
created
men
deprived
of
their
reflection
others
deprived
of
their
shadows
but
here
reality
by
the
neutrality
of
active
forces
made
men
in
whom
nothing
had
any
weight
and
who
weighed
nothing
themselves
suddenly
michel
making
a
slight
spring
left
the
floor
and
remained
suspended
in
the
air
like
the
good
monk
in
murillo
des
his
two
friends
joined
him
in
an
instant
and
all
three
in
the
centre
of
the
projectile
figured
a
miraculous
ascension
is
it
believable
is
it
likely
is
it
possible
cried
michel
no
and
yet
it
exists
ah
if
raphael
could
have
seen
us
like
this
what
an
assumption
he
could
have
put
upon
canvas
the
assumption
can
not
last
answered
barbicane
if
the
projectile
passes
the
neutral
point
the
lunar
attraction
will
draw
us
to
the
moon
then
our
feet
will
rest
upon
the
roof
of
the
projectile
answered
michel
no
said
barbicane
because
the
centre
of
gravity
in
the
projectile
is
very
low
and
it
will
turn
over
gradually
then
all
our
things
will
be
turned
upside
down
for
certain
do
not
alarm
yourself
michel
answered
nicholl
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
to
be
feared
not
an
object
will
move
the
projectile
will
turn
insensibly
in
fact
resumed
barbicane
when
it
has
cleared
the
point
of
equal
attraction
its
bottom
relatively
heavier
will
drag
it
perpendicularly
down
to
the
moon
but
in
order
that
such
a
phenomenon
should
take
place
we
must
pass
the
neutral
line
passing
the
neutral
line
cried
michel
then
let
us
do
like
the
sailors
who
pass
the
equator
let
us
water
our
passage
a
slight
side
movement
took
michel
to
the
padded
wall
thence
he
took
a
bottle
and
glasses
placed
them
in
space
before
his
companions
and
merrily
touching
glasses
they
saluted
the
line
with
a
triple
hurrah
this
influence
of
the
attractions
lasted
scarcely
an
hour
the
travellers
saw
themselves
insensibly
lowered
towards
the
bottom
and
barbicane
thought
he
remarked
that
the
conical
end
of
the
projectile
deviated
slightly
from
the
normal
direction
towards
the
moon
by
an
inverse
movement
the
bottom
side
approached
it
lunar
attraction
was
therefore
gaining
over
terrestrial
attraction
the
fall
towards
the
moon
began
insensibly
as
yet
it
could
only
be
that
of
a
millimetre
inch
and
a
third
in
the
first
second
but
the
attractive
force
would
gradually
increase
the
fall
would
be
more
accentuated
the
projectile
dragged
down
by
its
bottom
side
would
present
its
cone
to
the
earth
and
would
fall
with
increasing
velocity
until
it
reached
the
selenite
surface
now
nothing
could
prevent
the
success
of
the
enterprise
and
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
shared
barbicane
joy
then
they
chatted
about
all
the
phenomena
that
had
astounded
them
one
after
another
especially
about
the
neutralisation
of
the
laws
of
weight
michel
ardan
always
full
of
enthusiasm
wished
to
deduce
consequences
which
were
only
pure
imagination
ah
my
worthy
friends
he
cried
what
progress
we
should
make
could
we
but
get
rid
upon
earth
of
this
weight
this
chain
that
rivets
us
to
her
it
would
be
the
prisoner
restored
to
liberty
there
would
be
no
more
weariness
either
in
arms
or
legs
and
if
it
is
true
that
in
order
to
fly
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
to
sustain
yourself
in
the
air
by
a
simple
action
of
the
muscles
it
would
take
a
force
times
superior
to
that
we
possess
a
simple
act
of
will
a
caprice
would
transport
us
into
space
and
attraction
would
not
exist
in
fact
said
nicholl
laughing
if
they
succeeded
in
suppressing
gravitation
like
pain
is
suppressed
by
anaesthesia
it
would
change
the
face
of
modern
society
yes
cried
michel
full
of
his
subject
let
us
destroy
weight
and
have
no
more
burdens
no
more
cranes
windlasses
cranks
or
other
machines
will
be
wanted
well
said
replied
barbicane
but
if
nothing
had
any
weight
nothing
would
keep
in
its
place
not
even
the
hat
on
your
head
worthy
michel
nor
your
house
the
stones
of
which
only
adhere
by
their
weight
not
even
ships
whose
stability
upon
the
water
is
only
a
consequence
of
weight
not
even
the
ocean
whose
waves
would
no
longer
be
held
in
equilibrium
by
terrestrial
attraction
lastly
not
even
the
atmosphere
the
molecules
of
which
being
no
longer
held
together
would
disperse
into
space
that
is
a
pity
replied
michel
there
is
nothing
like
positive
people
for
recalling
you
brutally
to
reality
nevertheless
console
yourself
michel
resumed
barbicane
for
if
no
star
could
exist
from
which
the
laws
of
weight
were
banished
you
are
at
least
going
to
pay
a
visit
where
gravity
is
much
less
than
upon
earth
the
moon
yes
the
moon
on
the
surface
of
which
objects
weigh
six
times
less
than
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
a
phenomenon
very
easy
to
demonstrate
and
shall
we
perceive
it
asked
michel
evidently
for
lbs
only
weigh
lbs
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
will
not
our
muscular
strength
be
diminished
not
at
all
instead
of
jumping
one
yard
you
will
be
able
to
rise
six
then
we
shall
be
hercules
in
the
moon
cried
michel
yes
replied
nicholl
and
the
more
so
because
if
the
height
of
the
selenites
is
in
proportion
to
the
bulk
of
their
globe
they
will
be
hardly
a
foot
high
liliputians
replied
michel
then
i
am
going
to
play
the
of
gulliver
we
shall
realise
the
fable
of
the
giants
that
is
the
advantage
of
leaving
one
own
planet
to
visit
the
solar
world
but
if
you
want
to
play
gulliver
answered
barbicane
only
visit
the
inferior
planets
such
as
mercury
venus
or
mars
whose
bulk
is
rather
less
than
that
of
the
earth
but
do
not
venture
into
the
big
planets
jupiter
saturn
uranus
neptune
for
there
the
would
be
inverted
and
you
would
become
liliputian
and
in
the
sun
in
the
sun
though
its
density
is
four
times
less
than
that
of
the
earth
its
volume
is
thirteen
hundred
and
thousand
times
greater
and
gravitation
there
is
times
greater
than
upon
the
surface
of
our
globe
every
proportion
kept
the
inhabitants
ought
on
an
average
to
be
two
hundred
feet
high
the
devil
exclaimed
michel
i
should
only
be
a
pigmy
gulliver
amongst
the
giants
said
nicholl
just
so
answered
barbicane
it
would
not
have
been
a
bad
thing
to
carry
some
pieces
of
artillery
to
defend
oneself
with
good
replied
barbicane
your
bullets
would
have
no
effect
on
the
sun
and
they
would
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
few
minutes
that
saying
a
great
deal
it
is
a
fact
answered
barbicane
gravitation
is
so
great
on
that
enormous
planet
that
an
object
weighing
lbs
on
the
earth
would
weigh
lbs
on
the
surface
of
the
sun
your
hat
would
weigh
your
cigar
lastly
if
you
fell
on
the
solar
continent
your
weight
would
be
so
great
about
that
you
could
not
get
up
again
the
devil
said
michel
i
should
have
to
carry
about
a
portable
crane
well
my
friends
let
us
be
content
with
the
moon
for
there
at
least
we
shall
cut
a
great
figure
later
on
we
shall
see
if
we
will
go
to
the
sun
where
you
ca
drink
without
a
crane
to
lift
the
glass
to
your
mouth
chapter
ix
the
consequences
of
deviation
barbicane
had
now
no
fear
if
not
about
the
issue
of
the
journey
at
least
about
the
projectile
force
of
impulsion
its
own
speed
would
carry
it
beyond
the
neutral
line
therefore
it
would
not
return
to
the
earth
nor
remain
motionless
upon
the
point
of
attraction
one
hypothesis
only
remained
to
be
realised
the
arrival
of
the
bullet
at
its
goal
under
the
action
of
lunar
attraction
in
reality
it
was
a
fall
of
leagues
upon
a
planet
it
is
true
where
the
gravity
is
six
times
less
than
upon
the
earth
nevertheless
it
would
be
a
terrible
fall
and
one
against
which
all
precautions
ought
to
be
taken
without
delay
these
precautions
were
of
two
sorts
some
were
for
the
purpose
of
deadening
the
shock
at
the
moment
the
projectile
would
touch
lunar
ground
others
were
to
retard
the
shock
and
so
make
it
less
violent
in
order
to
deaden
the
shock
it
was
a
pity
that
barbicane
was
no
longer
able
to
employ
the
means
that
had
so
usefully
weakened
the
shock
at
departure
that
is
to
say
the
water
used
as
a
spring
and
the
movable
partitions
the
partitions
still
existed
but
water
was
wanting
for
they
could
not
use
the
reserve
for
this
purpose
that
would
be
precious
in
case
the
liquid
element
should
fail
on
the
lunar
soil
besides
this
reserve
would
not
have
been
sufficient
for
a
spring
the
layer
of
water
stored
in
the
projectile
at
their
departure
and
on
which
lay
the
waterproof
disc
occupied
no
less
than
three
feet
in
depth
and
spread
over
a
surface
of
not
less
than
feet
square
now
the
receptacles
did
not
contain
the
fifth
part
of
that
they
were
therefore
obliged
to
give
up
this
effectual
means
of
deadening
the
shock
fortunately
barbicane
not
content
with
employing
water
had
furnished
the
movable
disc
with
strong
spring
buffers
destined
to
lessen
the
shock
against
the
bottom
after
breaking
the
horizontal
partitions
these
buffers
were
still
in
existence
they
had
only
to
be
fitted
on
and
the
movable
disc
put
in
its
place
all
these
pieces
easy
to
handle
as
they
weighed
scarcely
anything
could
be
rapidly
mounted
this
was
done
the
different
pieces
were
adjusted
without
difficulty
it
was
only
a
matter
of
bolts
and
screws
there
were
plenty
of
tools
the
disc
was
soon
fixed
on
its
steel
buffers
like
a
table
on
its
legs
one
inconvenience
resulted
from
this
arrangement
the
lower
was
covered
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
travellers
to
observe
the
moon
through
that
opening
whilst
they
were
being
precipitated
perpendicularly
upon
her
but
they
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
besides
through
the
lateral
openings
they
could
still
perceive
the
vast
lunar
regions
like
the
earth
is
seen
from
the
car
of
a
balloon
this
placing
of
the
disc
took
an
hour
work
it
was
more
than
noon
when
the
preparations
were
completed
barbicane
made
fresh
observations
on
the
inclination
of
the
projectile
but
to
his
great
vexation
it
had
not
turned
sufficiently
for
a
fall
it
appeared
to
be
describing
a
curve
parallel
with
the
lunar
disc
the
queen
of
night
was
shining
splendidly
in
space
whilst
opposite
the
orb
of
day
was
setting
her
on
fire
with
his
rays
this
situation
soon
became
an
anxious
one
shall
we
get
there
said
nicholl
we
must
act
as
though
we
should
answered
barbicane
you
are
fellows
replied
michel
ardan
we
shall
get
there
and
quicker
than
we
want
this
answer
recalled
barbicane
to
his
preparations
and
he
occupied
himself
with
placing
the
contrivances
destined
to
retard
the
fall
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
the
meeting
held
in
tampa
town
florida
captain
nicholl
appeared
as
barbicane
enemy
and
michel
adversary
when
captain
nicholl
said
that
the
projectile
would
be
broken
like
glass
michel
answered
that
he
would
retard
the
fall
by
means
of
fusees
properly
arranged
in
fact
powerful
fusees
resting
upon
the
bottom
and
being
fired
outside
might
by
producing
a
recoil
action
lessen
the
speed
of
the
bullet
these
fusees
were
to
burn
in
the
void
it
is
true
but
oxygen
would
not
fail
them
for
they
would
furnish
that
themselves
like
the
lunar
volcanoes
the
deflagration
of
which
has
never
been
prevented
by
the
want
of
atmosphere
around
the
moon
barbicane
had
therefore
provided
himself
with
fireworks
shut
up
in
little
cannons
of
bored
steel
which
could
be
screwed
on
to
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
inside
these
cannons
were
level
with
the
bottom
outside
they
went
half
a
foot
beyond
it
there
were
twenty
of
them
an
opening
in
the
disc
allowed
them
to
light
the
match
with
which
each
was
provided
all
the
effect
took
place
outside
the
exploding
mixture
had
been
already
rammed
into
each
gun
all
they
had
to
do
therefore
was
to
take
up
the
metallic
buffers
fixed
in
the
base
and
to
put
these
cannons
in
their
place
where
they
fitted
exactly
this
fresh
work
was
ended
about
and
all
precaution
taken
they
had
now
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
in
the
meantime
the
projectile
visibly
drew
nearer
the
moon
it
was
therefore
submitted
in
some
proportion
to
its
influence
but
its
own
velocity
also
inclined
it
in
an
oblique
line
perhaps
the
result
of
these
two
influences
would
be
a
line
that
would
become
a
tangent
but
it
was
certain
that
the
projectile
was
not
falling
normally
upon
the
surface
of
the
moon
for
its
base
by
reason
of
its
weight
ought
to
have
been
turned
towards
her
barbicane
anxiety
was
increased
on
seeing
that
his
bullet
resisted
the
influence
of
gravitation
it
was
the
unknown
that
was
before
him
the
unknown
of
the
interstellar
regions
he
the
believed
that
he
had
foreseen
the
only
three
hypotheses
that
were
possible
the
return
to
the
earth
the
fall
upon
the
moon
or
stagnation
upon
the
neutral
line
and
here
a
fourth
hypothesis
full
of
all
the
terrors
of
the
infinite
cropped
up
inopportunely
to
face
it
without
flinching
took
a
resolute
like
barbicane
a
phlegmatic
being
like
nicholl
or
an
audacious
adventurer
like
michel
ardan
conversation
was
started
on
this
subject
other
men
would
have
considered
the
question
from
a
practical
point
of
view
they
would
have
wondered
where
the
projectile
would
take
them
to
not
they
however
they
sought
the
cause
that
had
produced
this
effect
so
we
are
off
the
line
said
michel
but
how
is
that
i
am
very
much
afraid
answered
nicholl
that
notwithstanding
all
the
precautions
that
were
taken
the
columbiad
was
not
aimed
correctly
the
slightest
error
would
suffice
to
throw
us
outside
the
pale
of
lunar
attraction
then
the
cannon
was
pointed
badly
said
michel
i
do
not
think
so
answered
barbicane
the
cannon
was
rigorously
perpendicular
and
its
direction
towards
the
zenith
of
the
place
was
incontestable
the
moon
passing
the
zenith
we
ought
to
have
reached
her
at
the
full
there
is
another
reason
but
it
escapes
me
perhaps
we
have
arrived
too
late
suggested
nicholl
too
late
said
barbicane
yes
resumed
nicholl
the
notice
from
the
cambridge
observatory
said
that
the
transit
ought
to
be
accomplished
in
hours
thirteen
minutes
and
twenty
seconds
that
means
that
before
that
time
the
moon
would
not
have
reached
the
point
indicated
and
after
she
would
have
passed
it
agreed
answered
barbicane
but
we
started
on
the
of
december
at
and
we
ought
to
arrive
at
midnight
on
the
precisely
as
the
moon
is
full
now
this
is
the
of
december
it
is
three
and
eight
hours
and
a
half
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
take
us
to
our
goal
why
are
we
not
going
towards
it
perhaps
the
velocity
was
greater
than
it
ought
to
have
been
answered
nicholl
for
we
know
now
that
the
initial
velocity
was
greater
than
it
was
supposed
to
be
no
a
hundred
times
no
replied
barbicane
an
excess
of
velocity
supposing
the
direction
of
the
projectile
to
have
been
correct
would
not
have
prevented
us
reaching
the
moon
no
there
has
been
a
deviation
we
have
deviated
through
whom
through
what
asked
nicholl
i
can
not
tell
answered
barbicane
well
barbicane
then
said
michel
should
you
like
to
know
what
i
think
about
why
we
have
deviated
say
what
you
think
i
would
not
give
half
a
dollar
to
know
we
have
deviated
that
is
a
fact
it
does
not
matter
much
where
we
are
going
we
shall
soon
find
out
as
we
are
being
carried
along
into
space
we
shall
end
by
falling
into
some
centre
of
attraction
or
another
barbicane
could
not
be
contented
with
this
indifference
of
michel
ardan
not
that
he
was
anxious
about
the
future
but
what
he
wanted
to
know
at
any
price
was
why
his
projectile
had
deviated
in
the
meantime
the
projectile
kept
on
its
course
sideways
to
the
moon
and
the
objects
thrown
out
along
with
it
barbicane
could
even
prove
by
the
landmarks
upon
the
moon
which
was
only
at
leagues
distance
that
its
speed
was
becoming
uniform
a
fresh
proof
that
they
were
not
falling
its
force
of
impulsion
was
prevailing
over
the
lunar
attraction
but
the
trajectory
of
the
projectile
was
certainly
taking
them
nearer
the
lunar
disc
and
it
might
be
hoped
that
at
a
nearer
point
the
weight
would
predominate
and
provoke
a
fall
the
three
friends
having
nothing
better
to
do
went
on
with
their
observations
they
could
not
however
yet
determine
the
topography
of
the
satellite
every
relief
was
levelled
under
the
action
of
the
solar
rays
they
watched
thus
through
the
lateral
windows
until
the
moon
then
looked
so
large
that
she
hid
half
the
firmament
from
them
the
sun
on
one
side
and
the
queen
of
night
on
the
other
inundated
the
projectile
with
light
at
that
moment
barbicane
thought
he
could
estimate
at
leagues
only
the
distance
that
separated
them
from
their
goal
the
velocity
of
the
projectile
appeared
to
him
to
be
yards
a
second
or
about
leagues
an
hour
the
base
of
the
bullet
had
a
tendency
to
turn
towards
the
moon
under
the
influence
of
the
centripetal
force
but
the
centrifugal
force
still
predominated
and
it
became
probable
that
the
rectilinear
trajectory
would
change
to
some
curve
the
nature
of
which
could
not
be
determined
barbicane
still
sought
the
solution
of
his
insoluble
problem
the
hours
went
by
without
result
the
projectile
visibly
drew
nearer
to
the
moon
but
it
was
plain
that
it
would
not
reach
her
the
short
distance
at
which
it
would
pass
her
would
be
the
result
of
two
forces
attractive
and
repulsive
which
acted
upon
the
projectile
i
only
pray
for
one
thing
repeated
michel
and
that
is
to
pass
near
enough
to
the
moon
to
penetrate
her
secrets
confound
the
cause
that
made
our
projectile
deviate
cried
nicholl
then
said
barbicane
as
if
he
had
been
suddenly
struck
with
an
idea
confound
that
asteroid
that
crossed
our
path
eh
said
michel
ardan
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
nicholl
i
mean
resumed
barbicane
who
appeared
convinced
i
mean
that
our
deviation
is
solely
due
to
the
influence
of
that
wandering
body
but
it
did
not
even
graze
us
continued
michel
what
does
that
matter
its
bulk
compared
with
that
of
our
projectile
was
enormous
and
its
attraction
was
sufficient
to
have
an
influence
upon
our
direction
that
influence
must
have
been
very
slight
said
nicholl
yes
nicholl
but
slight
as
it
was
answered
barbicane
upon
a
distance
of
leagues
it
was
enough
to
make
us
miss
the
moon
chapter
x
the
observers
of
the
moon
barbicane
had
evidently
found
the
only
plausible
reason
for
the
deviation
however
slight
it
had
been
it
had
been
sufficient
to
modify
the
trajectory
of
the
projectile
it
was
a
fatality
the
audacious
attempt
had
miscarried
by
a
fortuitous
circumstance
and
unless
anything
unexpected
happened
the
lunar
disc
could
no
longer
be
reached
would
they
pass
it
near
enough
to
resolve
certain
problems
in
physics
and
geology
until
then
unsolved
this
was
the
only
question
that
occupied
the
minds
of
these
bold
travellers
as
to
the
fate
the
future
held
in
store
for
them
they
would
not
even
think
about
it
yet
what
was
to
become
of
them
amidst
these
infinite
solitudes
when
air
failed
them
a
few
more
days
and
they
would
fall
suffocated
in
this
bullet
wandering
at
hazard
but
a
few
days
were
centuries
to
these
intrepid
men
and
they
consecrated
every
moment
to
observing
the
moon
they
no
longer
hoped
to
reach
the
distance
which
then
separated
the
projectile
from
the
satellite
was
estimated
at
about
leagues
under
these
conditions
as
far
as
regards
the
visibility
of
the
details
of
the
disc
the
travellers
were
farther
from
the
moon
than
are
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
with
their
powerful
telescopes
it
is
in
fact
known
that
the
instrument
set
up
by
lord
rosse
at
parsonstown
which
magnifies
times
brings
the
moon
to
within
sixteen
leagues
and
the
powerful
telescope
set
up
at
long
peak
magnifies
times
and
brings
the
moon
to
within
less
than
two
leagues
so
that
objects
twelve
yards
in
diameter
were
sufficiently
distinct
thus
then
at
that
distance
the
topographical
details
of
the
moon
seen
without
a
telescope
were
not
distinctly
determined
the
eye
caught
the
outline
of
those
vast
depressions
inappropriately
called
seas
but
they
could
not
determine
their
nature
the
prominence
of
the
mountains
disappeared
under
the
splendid
irradiation
produced
by
the
reflection
of
the
solar
rays
the
eye
dazzled
as
if
leaning
over
a
furnace
of
molten
silver
turned
from
it
involuntarily
however
the
oblong
form
of
the
orb
was
already
clearly
seen
it
appeared
like
a
gigantic
egg
with
the
small
end
turned
towards
the
earth
the
moon
liquid
and
pliable
in
the
first
days
of
her
formation
was
originally
a
perfect
sphere
but
soon
drawn
within
the
pale
of
the
earth
gravitation
she
became
elongated
under
its
influence
by
becoming
a
satellite
she
lost
her
native
purity
of
form
her
centre
of
gravity
was
in
advance
of
the
centre
of
her
figure
and
from
this
fact
some
draw
the
conclusion
that
air
and
water
might
have
taken
refuge
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
moon
which
is
never
seen
from
the
earth
this
alteration
in
the
primitive
forms
of
the
satellite
was
only
visible
for
a
few
moments
the
distance
between
the
projectile
and
the
moon
diminished
visibly
its
velocity
was
considerably
less
than
its
initial
velocity
but
eight
or
nine
times
greater
than
that
of
our
express
trains
the
oblique
direction
of
the
bullet
from
its
very
obliquity
left
michel
ardan
some
hope
of
touching
the
lunar
disc
at
some
point
or
other
he
could
not
believe
that
he
should
not
get
to
it
no
he
could
not
believe
it
and
this
he
often
repeated
but
barbicane
who
was
a
better
judge
always
answered
him
with
pitiless
logic
no
michel
no
we
can
only
reach
the
moon
by
a
fall
and
we
are
not
falling
the
centripetal
force
keeps
us
under
the
moon
influence
but
the
centrifugal
force
sends
us
irresistibly
away
from
it
this
was
said
in
a
tone
that
deprived
michel
ardan
of
his
last
hopes
the
portion
of
the
moon
the
projectile
was
approaching
was
the
northern
hemisphere
the
selenographic
maps
make
it
the
lower
one
because
they
are
generally
drawn
up
according
to
the
image
given
by
the
telescopes
and
we
know
that
they
reverse
the
objects
such
was
the
of
boeer
and
moedler
which
barbicane
consulted
this
northern
hemisphere
presented
vast
plains
relieved
by
isolated
mountains
at
midnight
the
moon
was
full
at
that
precise
moment
the
travellers
ought
to
have
set
foot
upon
her
if
the
unlucky
asteroid
had
not
made
them
deviate
from
their
direction
the
orb
was
exactly
in
the
condition
rigorously
determined
by
the
cambridge
observatory
she
was
mathematically
at
her
perigee
and
at
the
zenith
of
the
parallel
an
observer
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
enormous
columbiad
while
it
is
pointed
perpendicularly
at
the
horizon
would
have
framed
the
moon
in
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
a
straight
line
drawn
through
the
axis
of
the
piece
would
have
passed
through
the
centre
of
the
moon
it
need
hardly
be
stated
that
during
the
night
between
the
and
of
december
the
travellers
did
not
take
a
minute
rest
could
they
have
closed
their
eyes
so
near
to
a
new
world
no
all
their
feelings
were
concentrated
in
one
thought
to
see
representatives
of
the
earth
of
humanity
past
and
present
all
concentrated
in
themselves
it
was
through
their
eyes
that
the
human
race
looked
at
these
lunar
regions
and
penetrated
the
secrets
of
its
satellite
a
strange
emotion
filled
their
hearts
and
they
went
silently
from
one
window
to
another
their
observations
were
noted
down
by
barbicane
and
were
made
rigorously
exact
to
make
them
they
had
telescopes
to
control
them
they
had
maps
the
first
observer
of
the
moon
was
galileo
his
poor
telescope
only
magnified
thirty
times
nevertheless
in
the
spots
that
pitted
the
lunar
disc
like
eyes
in
a
peacock
tail
he
was
the
first
to
recognise
mountains
and
measure
some
heights
to
which
he
attributed
exaggerating
an

imagination

you
ever

a

asked
one
of
his
pupils
ironically
no
sir
answered
the

more
ironically
still
but
i
have
heard
it
spoken

in
one
sense
the
jocose
answer
of
the

might
have
been
made
by
the
immense
majority
of
sublunary
beings
how
many
people
there
are
who
have
heard
the
moon
spoken
of
and
have
never
seen
it
at
least
through
a
telescope
how
many
even
have
never
examined
the
map
of
their
satellite
looking
at
a
comprehensive
selenographic
map
one
peculiarity
strikes
us
at
once
in
contrast
to
the
geographical
arrangements
of
the
earth
and
mars
the
continents
occupy
the
more
southern
hemisphere
of
the
lunar
globe
these
continents
have
not
such
clear
and
regular
as
those
of
south
america
africa
and
the
indian
peninsula
their
angular
capricious
and
coasts
are
rich
in
gulfs
and
peninsulas
they
recall
the
confusion
in
the
islands
of
the
sound
where
the
earth
is
excessively
cut
up
if
navigation
has
ever
existed
upon
the
surface
of
the
moon
it
must
have
been
exceedingly
difficult
and
dangerous
and
the
selenite
mariners
and
hydrographers
were
greatly
to
be
pitied
the
former
when
they
came
upon
these
perilous
coasts
the
latter
when
they
were
marine
surveying
on
the
stormy
banks
it
may
also
be
noticed
that
upon
the
lunar
spheroid
the
south
pole
is
much
more
continental
than
the
north
pole
on
the
latter
there
is
only
a
slight
strip
of
land
capping
it
separated
from
the
other
continents
by
vast
seas
when
the
word
seas
is
used
the
vast
plains
probably
covered
by
the
sea
formerly
must
be
understood
on
the
south
the
land
covers
nearly
the
whole
hemisphere
it
is
therefore
possible
that
the
selenites
have
already
planted
their
flag
on
one
of
their
poles
whilst
franklin
ross

have
been
unable
to

islands
are
numerous
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
they
are
almost
all
oblong
or
circular
as
though
traced
with
a
compass
and
seem
to
form
a
vast
archipelago
like
that
charming
group
lying
between
greece
and
asia
minor
which
mythology
formerly
animated
with
its
most
graceful
legends
involuntarily
the
names
of
naxos
tenedos
milo
and
carpathos
come
into
the
mind
and
you
seek
the
ship
of
ulysses
or
the
clipper
of
the
argonauts
that
was
what
it
appeared
to
michel
ardan
it
was
a
grecian
archipelago
that
he
saw
on
the
map
in
the
eyes
of
his
less
imaginative
companions
the
aspect
of
these
shores
recalled
rather
the
lands
of
new
brunswick
and
nova
scotia
and
where
the
frenchman
looked
for
traces
of
the
heroes
of

these

were
noting
favourable
points
for

some
remarks
on
the
orographical
disposition
of
the
moon
must
conclude
the
description
of
its
continents
chains
of
mountains
isolated
mountains
amphitheatres
and
watercourses
the
moon
is
like
an
immense
switzerland
a
continual
norway
where
plutonic
influence
has
done
everything
this
surface
so
profoundly
rugged
is
the
result
of
the
successive
contractions
of
the
crust
while
the
orb
was
being
formed
the
lunar
disc
is
propitious
for
the
study
of
great
geological
phenomena
according
to
the
remarks
of
some
astronomers
its
surface
although
more
ancient
than
the
surface
of
the
earth
has
remained
newer
there
there
is
no
water
to
deteriorate
the
primitive
relief
the
continuous
action
of
which
produces
a
sort
of
general
levelling
no
air
the
decomposing
influence
of
which
modifies
orographical
profiles
there
pluto
work
unaltered
by
neptune
is
in
all
its
native
purity
it
is
the
earth
as
she
was
before
tides
and
currents
covered
her
with
layers
of
soil
after
having
wandered
over
these
vast
continents
the
eye
is
attracted
by
still
vaster
seas
not
only
does
their
formation
situation
and
aspect
recall
the
terrestrial
oceans
but
as
upon
earth
these
seas
occupy
the
largest
part
of
the
globe
and
yet
these
are
not
liquid
tracts
but
plains
the
nature
of
which
the
travellers
hoped
soon
to
determine
astronomers
it
must
be
owned
have
decorated
these
pretended
seas
with
at
least
odd
names
which
science
has
respected
at
present
michel
ardan
was
right
when
he
compared
this
map
to
a
map
of
tenderness
drawn
up
by
scudery
or
cyrano
de
bergerac
only
added
he
it
is
no
longer
the
map
of
sentiment
like
that
of
the
century
it
is
the
map
of
life
clearly
divided
into
two
parts
the
one
feminine
the
other
masculine
to
the
women
the
right
hemisphere
to
the
men
the
left
when
he
spoke
thus
michel
made
his
prosaic
companions
shrug
their
shoulders
barbicane
and
nicholl
looked
at
the
lunar
map
from
another
point
of
view
to
that
of
their
imaginative
friend
however
their
imaginative
friend
had
some
reason
on
his
side
judge
if
he
had
not
in
the
left
hemisphere
stretches
the
sea
of
clouds
where
human
reason
is
so
often
drowned
not
far
off
appears
the
sea
of
rains
fed
by
all
the
worries
of
existence
near
lies
the
sea
of
tempests
where
man
struggles
incessantly
against
his
victorious
passions
then
exhausted
by
deceptions
treasons
infidelities
and
all
the
procession
of
terrestrial
miseries
what
does
he
find
at
the
end
of
his
career
the
vast
sea
of
humours
scarcely
softened
by
some
drops
from
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
dew
clouds
rain
tempests
humours
does
the
life
of
man
contain
aught
but
these
and
is
it
not
summed
up
in
these
four
words
the
hemisphere
dedicated
to
the
women
contains
smaller
seas
the
significant
names
of
which
agree
with
every
incident
of
feminine
existence
there
is
the
sea
of
serenity
over
which
bends
the
young
maiden
and
the
lake
of
dreams
which
reflects
her
back
a
happy
future
the
sea
of
nectar
with
its
waves
of
tenderness
and
breezes
of
love
the
sea
of
fecundity
the
sea
of
crises
and
the
sea
of
vapours
the
dimensions
of
which
are
perhaps
too
restricted
and
lastly
that
vast
sea
of
tranquillity
where
all
false
passions
all
useless
dreams
all
unassuaged
desires
are
absorbed
and
the
waves
of
which
flow
peacefully
into
the
lake
of
death
what
a
strange
succession
of
names
what
a
singular
division
of
these
two
hemispheres
of
the
moon
united
to
one
another
like
man
and
woman
and
forming
a
sphere
of
life
carried
through
space
and
was
not
the
imaginative
michel
right
in
thus
interpreting
the
fancies
of
the
old
astronomers
but
whilst
his
imagination
thus
ran
riot
on
the
seas
his
grave
companions
were
looking
at
things
more
geographically
they
were
learning
this
new
world
by
heart
they
were
measuring
its
angles
and
diameters
to
barbicane
and
nicholl
the
sea
of
clouds
was
an
immense
depression
of
ground
with
circular
mountains
scattered
about
on
it
covering
a
great
part
of
the
western
side
of
the
southern

it
covered
square

its

was
in

the

from

emerge
the
admirable

aristarchus
more
to
the

and
separated
from

by
high
chains
of

extends
the

of

having
its
central
point
in

it
is
of
a
nearly
circular
form
and
covers
a
space
of
leagues
not
far
distant
the
sea
of
humours
a
little
basin
of
square

only
was
situated
in

the

little

inclosed
by

the

naturally
more
capricious
was
distinguished
by
smaller
and
more
numerous
seas
these
were
towards
the
north
the
in
north

and

with
square
leagues
of
surface
which
joined
the
lake
of

and

of

the

of

by

comprising
a
surface
of

the

round
and
very
compact
in
north

and
west

a
surface
of

a
veritable
caspian
buried
in
a
girdle
of
mountains
then
on
the
equator
in
north
latitude
and
west

appeared
the
sea
of
tranquillity
occupying
square
leagues
of
surface
this
sea
communicated
on
the
south
with
the
sea
of
nectar
an
extent
of
square

in

and
on
the
east
with
the
sea
of

the
vastest
in
this
hemisphere
occupying
square
leagues
in
south
latitude
and
west

lastly
quite
to
the
north
and
quite
to
the
south
lie
two
more
seas
the
sea
of
humboldt
with
a
surface
of
square

and
the
southern

with

across

on

lies
the

a

between
the

thus
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
nicholl
and
barbicane
the
surface
always
visible
of
the
earth
satellite
when
they
added
up
these
different
figures
they
found
that
the
surface
of
this
hemisphere
measured
square
leagues
of
which
go
for
volcanoes
chains
of
mountains
amphitheatres
islands
in
a
word
all
that
seems
to
form
the
solid
portion
of
the

and
leagues
for
the
seas
lake
marshes
and
all
that
seems
to
form
the
liquid
portion
all
of
which
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
worthy
michel
it
will
be
noticed
that
this
hemisphere
is
thirteen
and
times
smaller
than
the
terrestrial
hemisphere
and
yet
upon
it
selenographers
have
already
counted
craters
it
is
a
rugged
surface
worthy
of
the
unpoetical
qualification
of
green
cheese
which
the
english
have
given
it
when
barbicane
pronounced
this
disobliging
name
michel
ardan
gave
a
bound
that
is
how
the
of
the

treat
the
beautiful

orographical
details
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
the
direction
followed
by
the
projectile
was
taking
us
towards
the
northern
hemisphere
of
the
moon
the
travellers
were
far
from
that
central
point
which
they
ought
to
have
touched
if
their
trajectory
had
not
suffered
an
irremediable
deviation
it
was
twelve
at
night
barbicane
then
estimated
his
distance
at
kilometres
a
distance
rather
greater
than
the
length
of
the
lunar
radius
and
which
must
diminish
as
he
drew
nearer
the
north
pole
the
projectile
was
then
not
at
the
altitude
of
the
equator
but
on
the
tenth
parallel
and
from
that
latitude
carefully
observed
on
the
map
as
far
as
the
pole
barbicane
and
his
two
companions
were
able
to
watch
the
moon
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
in
fact
by
using
telescopes
this
distance
of
kilometres
was
reduced
to
fourteen
miles
or
four
and
leagues
the
telescope
of
the
rocky
mountains
brought
the
moon
still
nearer
but
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
singularly
lessened
its
optical
power
thus
barbicane
in
his
projectile
by
looking
through
his
glass
could
already
perceive
certain
details
almost
imperceptible
to
observers
on
the
earth
my
friends
then
said
the
president
in
a
grave
voice
i
do
not
know
where
we
are
going
nor
whether
we
shall
ever
see
the
terrestrial
globe
again
nevertheless
let
us
do
our
work
as
if
one
day
it
would
be
of
use
to
our
let
us
keep
our
minds
free
from
all
preoccupation
we
are
astronomers
this
bullet
is
the
cambridge
observatory
transported
into
space
let
us
make
our
observations
that
said
the
work
was
begun
with
extreme
precision
and
it
faithfully
reproduced
the
different
aspects
of
the
moon
at
the
variable
distances
which
the
projectile
reached
in
relation
to
that
orb
whilst
the
bullet
was
at
the
altitude
of
the
north
parallel
it
seemed
to
follow
the
degree
of
east
longitude
here
may
be
placed
an
important
remark
on
the
subject
of
the
map
which
they
used
for
their
observations
in
the
selenographic
maps
where
on
account
of
the
reversal
of
objects
by
the
telescope
the
south
is
at
the
top
and
the
north
at
the
bottom
it
seems
natural
that
the
east
should
be
on
the
left
and
the
west
on
the
right
however
it
is
not
so
if
the
map
were
turned
upside
down
and
showed
the
moon
as
she
appears
the
east
would
be
left
and
the
west
right
the
inverse
of
the
terrestrial
maps
the
reason
of
this
anomaly
is
the
following
observers
situated
in
the
northern
hemisphere
in
europe
for
example
perceive
the
moon
in
the
south
from
them
when
they
look
at
her
they
turn
their
backs
to
the
north
the
opposite
position
they
take
when
looking
at
a
terrestrial
map
their
backs
being
turned
to
the
north
they
have
the
east
to
the
left
and
the
west
to
the
right
for
observers
in
the
southern
hemisphere
in
patagonia
for
example
the
west
of
the
moon
would
be
on
their
left
and
the
east
on
their
right
for
the
south
would
be
behind
them
such
is
the
reason
for
the
apparent
reversal
of
these
two
cardinal
points
and
this
must
be
remembered
whilst
following
the
observations
of
president
barbicane
helped
by
the
of
boeer
and
moedler
the
travellers
could
without
hesitating
survey
that
portion
of
the
disc
in
the
field
of
their
telescopes
what
are
we
looking
at
now
asked
michel
at
the
northern
portion
of
the
sea
of
clouds
answered
barbicane
we
are
too
far
off
to
make
out
its
nature
are
those
plains
composed
of
dry
sand
as
the
first
astronomers
believed
or
are
they
only
immense
forests
according
to
the
opinion
of
waren
de
la
rue
who
grants
a
very
low
but
very
dense
atmosphere
to
the
moon
we
shall
find
that
out
later
on
we
will
affirm
nothing
till
we
are
quite
certain
this
sea
of
clouds
is
rather
doubtfully
traced
upon
the
maps
it
is
supposed
that
this
vast
plain
is
strewn
with
blocks
of
lava
vomited
by
the
neighbouring
volcanoes
on
its
right
side
ptolemy
purbach
and
arzachel
the
projectile
was
drawing
sensibly
nearer
and
the
summits
which
close
in
this
sea
on
the
north
were
distinctly
visible
in
front
rose
a
mountain
shining
gloriously
the
top
of
which
seemed
drowned
in
the
solar
rays
that
mountain
is
asked
michel
copernicus
answered
barbicane
let
us
have
a
look
at
copernicus
said
michel
this
mountain
situated
in
north
latitude
and
east
longitude
rises
to
a
height
of
nearly
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
moon
it
is
quite
visible
from
the
earth
and
astronomers
can
study
it
with
ease
especially
during
the
phase
between
the
last
quarter
and
the
new
moon
because
then
shadows
are
thrown
lengthways
from
east
to
west
and
allow
the
altitudes
to
be
taken
copernicus
forms
the
most
important
radiating
system
in
the
southern
hemisphere
according
to
tycho
brahe
it
rises
isolated
like
a
gigantic
lighthouse
over
that
of
the
sea
of
clouds
bordering
on
the
sea
of
tempests
and
it
lights
two
oceans
at
once
with
its
splendid
rays
those
long
luminous
trails
so
dazzling
at
full
moon
made
a
spectacle
without
an
equal
they
pass
the
boundary
chains
on
the
north
and
stretch
as
far
as
the
sea
of
rains
at
terrestrial
time
the
projectile
like
a
balloon
carried
into
space
hung
over
this
superb
mountain
barbicane
could
perfectly
distinguish
its
chief
features
copernicus
is
comprehended
in
the
series
of
annular
mountains
of
the
first
order
in
the
division
of
the
large
amphitheatres
like
the
mountains
of
kepler
and
aristarchus
which
overlook
the
ocean
of
tempests
it
appears
sometimes
like
a
brilliant
point
through
the
pale
light
and
used
to
be
taken
for
a
volcano
in
activity
but
it
is
only
an
extinct
volcano
like
those
on
that
side
of
the
moon
its
circumference
presented
a
diameter
of
about
leagues
the
glasses
showed
traces
of
stratifications
in
it
produced
by
successive
eruptions
and
its
neighbourhood
appeared
strewn
with
volcanic
remains
which
were
still
seen
in
the
crater
there
exist
said
barbicane
several
sorts
of
amphitheatres
an
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
copernicus
belongs
to
the
radiating
class
if
we
were
nearer
it
we
should
perceive
the
cones
which
bristle
in
the
interior
and
which
were
formerly
so
many
fiery
mouths
a
curious
arrangement
and
one
without
exception
on
the
lunar
disc
is
presented
on
the
interior
surface
of
these
amphitheatres
being
notably
downward
from
the
exterior
plane
a
contrary
form
to
that
which
terrestrial
craters
present
it
follows
therefore
that
the
general
curvature
at
the
bottom
of
these
amphitheatres
gives
us
fear
of
an
inferior
diameter
to
that
of
the
moon
what
is
the
reason
of
this
special
arrangement
asked
nicholl
it
is
not
known
answered
barbicane
how
splendidly
it
shines
said
michel
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
a
more
beautiful
spectacle
what
should
you
say
then
answered
barbicane
if
the
chances
of
our
journey
should
take
us
towards
the
southern
hemisphere
well
i
should
say
it
is
finer
still
replied
michel
ardan
at
that
moment
the
projectile
hung
right
over
the
amphitheatre
the
circumference
of
copernicus
formed
an
almost
perfect
circle
and
its
steep
ramparts
were
clearly
defined
a
second
circular
inclosure
could
even
be
distinguished
a
grey
plain
of
wild
aspect
spread
around
on
which
every
relief
appeared
yellow
at
the
bottom
of
the
amphitheatre
as
if
in
a
sparkled
for
one
instant
two
or
three
eruptive
cones
like
enormous
dazzling
gems
towards
the
north
the
sides
of
the
crater
were
lowered
into
a
depression
which
would
probably
have
given
access
to
the
interior
of
the
crater
as
they
passed
above
the
surrounding
plain
barbicane
was
able
to
note
a
large
number
of
mountains
of
slight
importance
amongst
others
a
little
circular
mountain
called
more
than
kilometres
wide
towards
the
south
the
plain
was
very
flat
without
one
elevation
or
projection
of
the
soil
towards
the
north
on
the
contrary
as
far
as
the
place
where
it
borders
on
the
ocean
of
tempests
it
was
like
a
liquid
surface
agitated
by
a
storm
of
which
the
hills
and
hollows
formed
a
succession
of
waves
suddenly
coagulated
over
the
whole
of
this
and
in
all
directions
ran
the
luminous
trails
which
converged
to
the
summit
of
copernicus
some
had
a
width
of
thirty
kilometres
over
a
length
that
could
not
be
estimated
the
travellers
discussed
the
origin
of
these
strange
rays
but
they
could
not
determine
their
nature
any
better
than
terrestrial
observers
why
said
nicholl
may
not
these
rays
be
simply
the
spurs
of
the
mountains
reflecting
the
light
of
the
sun
more
vividly
no
answered
barbicane
if
it
were
so
in
certain
conditions
of
the
moon
they
would
throw
shadows
which
they
do
not
in
fact
these
rays
only
appear
when
the
sun
is
in
opposition
with
the
moon
and
they
disappear
as
soon
as
its
rays
become
oblique
but
what
explanation
of
these
trails
of
light
have
been
imagined
asked
michel
for
i
can
not
believe
that
would
ever
stop
short
for
want
of
explanation
yes
answered
barbicane
herschel
has
uttered
an
opinion
but
he
does
not
affirm
it
never
mind
what
is
his
opinion
he
thought
that
these
rays
must
be
streams
of
cold
lava
which
shone
when
the
sun
struck
them
normally
that
may
be
true
but
nothing
is
less
certain
however
if
we
pass
nearer
to
tycho
we
shall
be
in
a
better
position
to
find
out
the
cause
of
this
radiation
what
do
you
think
that
plain
is
like
seen
from
the
height
we
are
at
asked
michel
i
do
know
answered
nicholl
well
with
all
these
pieces
of
lava
sharpened
like
spindles
it
looks
like
immense
game
of
spilikins
thrown
down
we
only
want
a
hook
to
draw
them
up
be
serious
for
once
in
your
life
said
barbicane
i
will
be
serious
replied
michel
tranquilly
and
instead
of
spilikins
let
us
say
they
are
bones
this
plain
would
then
be
only
an
immense
cemetery
upon
which
would
repose
the
immortal
remains
of
a
thousand
distinct
generations
do
you
like
that
comparison
better
one
is
as
good
as
the
other
answered
barbicane
the
devil
you
are
difficult
to
please
replied
michel
my
worthy
friend
resumed
the
prosaic
barbicane
it
does
not
matter
what
it
looks
like
when
we
do
know
what
it
is
a
good
answer
exclaimed
michel
that
will
teach
me
to
argue
with
in
the
meantime
the
projectile
went
with
almost
uniform
speed
round
the
lunar
disc
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
the
travellers
did
not
dream
of
taking
a
minute
rest
a
fresh
landscape
lay
before
their
eyes
every
instant
about
one
in
the
morning
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
summit
of
another
mountain
barbicane
consulted
his
map
and
recognised
eratosthenes
it
was
a
circular
mountain
metres
high
one
of
those
amphitheatres
so
numerous
upon
the
satellite
barbicane
informed
his
friends
of
kepler
singular
opinion
upon
the
formation
of
these
circles
according
to
the
celebrated
mathematician
these
crateriform
cavities
had
been
dug
out
by
the
hand
of
man
what
for
asked
nicholl
in
order
to
preserve
themselves
from
the
ardour
of
the
solar
rays
which
strike
the
moon
during
fifteen
consecutive
days
the
selenites
were
not
fools
said
michel
it
was
a
singular
idea
answered
nicholl
but
it
is
probable
that
kepler
did
not
know
the
real
dimensions
of
these
circles
for
digging
them
would
have
been
giants
labour
impracticable
for
selenites
why
so
if
the
weight
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
is
six
times
less
than
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
said
michel
but
if
the
selenites
are
six
times
smaller
replied
nicholl
and
if
there
are
no
selenites
added
barbicane
which
terminated
the
discussion
eratosthenes
soon
disappeared
from
the
horizon
without
the
projectile
having
been
sufficiently
near
it
to
allow
a
rigorous
observation
this
mountain
separated
the
apennines
from
the
carpathians
in
lunar
orography
several
chains
of
mountains
have
been
distinguished
which
are
principally
distributed
over
the
northern
hemisphere
some
however
occupy
certain
portions
of
the
southern
hemisphere
the
following
is
a
list

these
different

the
most
important
of
these
different
chains
is
that
of
the
apennines
the
development
of
which
extends
leagues
and
is
yet
inferior
to
that
of
the
great
orographical
movements
of
the
earth
the
apennines
run
along
the
eastern
border
of
the
sea
of
rains
and
are
continued
on
the
north
by
the
carpathians
the
profile
of
which
measures
about
leagues
the
travellers
could
only
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
summit
of
these
apennines
which
lie
between
west
long
and
east
long
but
the
chain
of
the
carpathians
was
visible
from
to
east
and
they
could
see
how
they
were
distributed
one
hypothesis
seemed
to
them
very
justifiable
seeing
that
this
chain
of
the
carpathians
was
here
and
there
circular
in
form
and
with
high
peaks
they
concluded
that
it
anciently
formed
important
amphitheatres
these
mountainous
circles
must
have
been
broken
up
by
the
vast
cataclysm
to
which
the
sea
of
rains
was
due
these
carpathians
looked
then
what
the
amphitheatres
of
purbach
arzachel
and
ptolemy
would
if
some
cataclysm
were
to
throw
down
their
left
ramparts
and
transform
them
into
continuous
chains
they
present
an
average
height

at

from

which
bears
the
name

the
distance
from
the

to
the

was
only
kilometres
brought
by
means
of
telescopes
to
two
and
a
half

the

lay
before
the

rose
the
shining
mountain
of
euler
this
mountain
which
rises
only
metres
above
the
lunar
surface
has
been
the
object
of
an
interesting
work
by
the
astronomer
schroeter
this
trying
to
find
out
the
origin
of
the
lunar
mountains
asked
himself
whether
the
volume
of
the
crater
always
looked
equal
to
the
volume
of
the
ramparts
that
formed
it
now
this
he
found
to
be
generally
the
case
and
he
hence
concluded
that
a
single
eruption
of
volcanic
matter
had
sufficed
to
form
these
ramparts
for
successive
eruptions
would
have
destroyed
the
connection
mount
euler
alone
was
an
exception
to
this
general
law
and
it
must
have
taken
several
successive
eruptions
to
form
it
for
the
volume
of
its
cavity
is
double
that
of
its
inclosure
all
these
hypotheses
were
allowable
to
terrestrial
observers
whose
instruments
were
incomplete
but
barbicane
was
no
longer
contented
to
accept
them
and
seeing
that
his
projectile
drew
regularly
nearer
the
lunar
disc
he
did
not
despair
of
ultimately
reaching
it
or
at
least
of
finding
out
the
secrets
of
its
formation
chapter

lunar
landscapes
at
two
in
the
morning
the
bullet
was
over
the
lunar
parallel
at
an
effective
distance
of
kilometres
reduced
by
the
optical
instruments
to
ten
it
still
seemed
impossible
that
it
could
reach
any
point
on
the
disc
its
movement
of
translation
relatively
slow
was
inexplicable
to
president
barbicane
at
that
distance
from
the
moon
it
ought
to
have
been
fast
in
order
to
maintain
it
against
the
power
of
attraction
the
reason
of
that
phenomenon
was
also
inexplicable
besides
time
was
wanting
to
seek
for
the
cause
the
reliefs
on
the
lunar
surface
flew
beneath
their
eyes
and
they
did
not
want
to
lose
a
single
detail
the
disc
appeared
through
the
telescopes
at
a
distance
of
two
and
a
half
leagues
if
an
a√´ronaut
were
taken
up
that
distance
from
the
earth
what
would
he
distinguish
upon
its
surface
no
one
can
tell
as
the
highest
ascensions
have
not
exceeded
metres
the
following
however
is
an
exact
description
of
what
barbicane
and
his
companions
saw
from
that
height
large
patches
of
different
colours
appeared
on
the
disc
selenographers
do
not
agree
about
their
nature
they
are
quite
distinct
from
each
other
julius
schmidt
is
of
opinion
that
if
the
terrestrial
oceans
were
dried
up
a
selenite
observer
could
only
tell
the
difference
between
the
terrestrial
oceans
and
continental
plains
by
patches
of
colour
as
distinctly
varied
as
those
which
a
terrestrial
observer
sees
upon
the
moon
according
to
him
the
colour
common
to
the
vast
plains
known
under
the
name
of
seas
is
dark
grey
intermingled
with
green
and
brown
some
of
the
large
craters
are
coloured
in
the
same
way
barbicane
knew
this
opinion
of
the
german
selenographer
it
is
shared
by
boeer
and
moedler
he
noticed
that
they
were
right
whilst
certain
astronomers
who
only
allow
grey
colouring
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
are
wrong
in
certain
places
the
green
colour
was
very
vivid
according
to
julius
schmidt
it
is
so
in
the
seas
of
serenity
and
humours
barbicane
likewise
remarked
the
wide
craters
with
no
interior
cones
which
are
of
a
bluish
colour
analogous
to
that
of
sheets
of
steel
these
colours
really
belonged
to
the
lunar
disc
and
did
not
result
as
certain
astronomers
think
either
from
some
imperfection
in
the
of
the
telescopes
or
the
interposition
of
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
barbicane
had
no
longer
any
doubt
about
it
he
was
looking
at
it
through
the
void
and
could
not
commit
any
optical
error
he
considered
that
the
existence
of
this
different
colouring
was
proved
to
science
now
were
the
green
shades
owing
to
tropical
vegetation
kept
up
by
a
low
and
dense
atmosphere
he
could
not
yet
be
certain
farther
on
he
noticed
a
reddish
tinge
quite
sufficiently
distinct
a
similar
colour
had
already
been
observed
upon
the
bottom
of
an
isolated
inclosure
known
under
the
name
of
the
lichtenberg
amphitheatre
which
is
situated
near
the
hercynian
mountains
on
the
border
of
the
moon
but
he
could
not
make
out
its
nature
he
was
not
more
fortunate
about
another
peculiarity
of
the
disc
for
he
could
not
find
out
its
cause
the
peculiarity
was
the
following
one
michel
ardan
was
watching
near
the
president
when
he
remarked
some
long
white
lines
brilliantly
lighted
up
by
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
it
was
a
succession
of
luminous
furrows
very
different
from
the
radiation
that
copernicus
had
presented
they
ran
in
parallel
lines
michel
with
his
usual
readiness
exclaimed
why
there
are
cultivated
fields
cultivated
fields
repeated
nicholl
shrugging
his
shoulders
ploughed
fields
at
all
events
replied
michel
ardan
but
what
ploughmen
these
selenites
must
be
and
what
gigantic
oxen
they
must
harness
to
their
ploughs
to
make
such
furrows
they
are
not
furrows
they
are
crevices
crevices
let
them
be
answered
michel
with
docility
only
what
do
you
mean
by
crevices
in
the
world
of
science
barbicane
soon
told
his
companions
all
he
knew
about
lunar
crevices
he
knew
that
they
were
furrows
observed
upon
all
the
parts
of
the
lunar
disc
that
these
furrows
generally
isolated
were
from
four
to
five
leagues
only
that
their
width
varies
from
to
metres
and
their
edges
are
rigorously
parallel
but
he
knew
nothing
more
about
their
formation
or
their
nature
barbicane
watched
these
furrows
through
his
telescope
very
attentively
he
noticed
that
their
banks
were
exceedingly
steep
they
were
long
parallel
ramparts
with
a
little
imagination
they
might
be
taken
for
long
lines
of
fortifications
raised
by
selenite
engineers
some
of
these
furrows
were
as
straight
as
if
they
had
been
cut
by
line
others
were
slightly
curved
through
with
edges
still
parallel
some
crossed
each
other
some
crossed
craters
some
furrowed
the
circular
cavities
such
as
posidonius
or
petavius
some
crossed
the
seas
notably
the
sea
of
serenity
these
accidents
of
nature
had
naturally
exercised
the
imagination
of
terrestrial
astronomers
the
earliest
observations
did
not
discover
these
furrows
neither
hevelius
cassini
la
hire
nor
herschel
seems
to
have
known
them
it
was
schroeter
who
in
first
attracted
the
attention
of
to
them
others
followed
who
studied
them
such
as
pastorff
gruithuysen
boeer
and
moedler
at
present
there
are
but
though
they
have
been
counted
their
nature
has
not
yet
been
determined
they
are
not
fortifications
certainly
anymore
than
they
are
beds
of
rivers
for
water
so
light
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
could
not
have
dug
such
ditches
and
there
furrows
often
cross
craters
at
a
great
elevation
it
must
however
be
acknowledged
that
michel
ardan
had
an
idea
and
that
without
knowing
it
he
shared
it
with
julius
schmidt
why
said
he
may
not
these
inexplicable
appearances
be
simply
phenomena
of
vegetation
in
what
way
do
you
mean
asked
barbicane
now
do
not
be
angry
worthy
president
answered
michel
but
may
not
these
black
lines
be
regular
rows
of
trees
do
you
want
to
find
some
vegetation
said
barbicane
i
want
to
explain
what
you
scientific
men
do
not
explain
my
hypothesis
will
at
least
explain
why
these
furrows
disappear
or
seem
to
disappear
at
regular
epochs
why
should
they
because
trees
might
become
invisible
when
they
lose
their
leaves
and
visible
when
they
grow
again
your
explanation
is
ingenious
old
fellow
answered
barbicane
but
it
can
not
be
admitted
why
because
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
any
season
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
consequently
the
phenomena
of
vegetation
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
can
not
be
produced
in
fact
the
slight
obliquity
of
the
lunar
axis
keeps
the
sun
there
at
an
almost
equal
altitude
under
every
latitude
above
the
equatorial
regions
the
radiant
orb
almost
invariably
occupies
the
zenith
and
hardly
passes
the
limit
of
the
horizon
in
the
polar
regions
therefore
in
each
region
according
to
its
position
there
reigns
perpetual
spring
summer
autumn
or
winter
as
in
the
planet
jupiter
whose
axis
is
also
slightly
inclined
upon
its
orbit
the
origin
of
these
furrows
is
a
difficult
question
to
solve
they
are
certainly
posterior
to
the
formation
of
the
craters
and
amphitheatres
for
several
have
crossed
them
and
broken
their
circular
ramparts
it
may
be
that
they
are
contemporary
with
the
latest
geographical
epochs
and
are
only
owing
to
the
expansion
of
natural
forces
in
the
meantime
the
projectile
had
reached
the
altitude
of
the
degree
of
lunar
latitude
at
a
distance
that
could
not
be
greater
than
kilometres
objects
appeared
through
the
telescopes
at
two
leagues
only
at
this
point
rose
under
their
feet
the
helicon
metres
high
and
on
the
left
were
the
mediocre
heights
which
inclose
a
small
portion
of
the
sea
of
rains
under
the
name
of
the
gulf
of
iris
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
ought
to
be
times
more
transparent
than
it
is
in
order
to
allow
astronomers
to
make
complete
observations
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
but
in
the
void
the
projectile
was
moving
in
no
fluid
lay
between
the
eye
of
the
observer
and
the
object
observed
what
is
more
barbicane
was
at
a
less
distance
than
the
most
powerful
telescopes
even
that
of
lord
rosse
or
the
one
on
the
rocky
mountains
could
give
it
was
therefore
in
circumstances
highly
favourable
for
solving
the
great
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
yet
the
solution
of
this
question
escaped
him
still
he
could
only
distinguish
the
deserted
beds
of
the
immense
plains
and
towards
the
north
arid
mountains
no
labour
betrayed
the
hand
of
man
no
ruin
indicated
his
passage
no
agglomeration
of
animals
indicated
that
life
was
developed
there
even
in
an
inferior
degree
there
was
no
movement
anywhere
no
appearance
of
vegetation
anywhere
of
the
three
kingdoms
represented
on
the
terrestrial
globe
one
only
was
represented
on
that
of
the
moon
the
mineral
kingdom
so
said
michel
ardan
looking
rather
put
out
there
is
nobody
after
all
no
answered
nicholl
we
have
seen
neither
man
animal
nor
tree
as
yet
after
all
if
the
atmosphere
has
taken
refuge
at
the
bottom
of
cavities
in
the
interior
of
the
amphitheatres
or
even
on
the
opposite
face
of
the
moon
we
can
not
decide
the
question
besides
added
barbicane
even
for
the
most
piercing
sight
a
man
is
not
visible
at
a
distance
of
more
than
four
miles
therefore
if
there
are
any
selenites
they
can
see
our
projectile
but
we
can
not
see
them
about
at
the
altitude
of
the
parallel
the
distance
was
reduced
to
miles
on
the
left
rose
the
capricious
outlines
of
a
chain
of
mountains
outlined
in
full
light
towards
the
right
on
the
contrary
was
a
large
black
hole
like
a
vast
dark
and
bottomless
well
bored
in
the
lunar
soil
that
hole
was
the
black
lake
or
pluto
a
deep
circle
from
which
the
earth
could
be
conveniently
studied
between
the
last
quarter
and
the
new
moon
when
the
shadows
are
thrown
from
west
to
east
this
black
colour
is
rarely
met
with
on
the
surface
of
the
satellite
it
has
as
yet
only
been
seen
in
the
depths
of
the
circle
of
endymion
to
the
east
of
the
cold
sea
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
circle
of
grimaldi
upon
the
equator
towards
the
eastern
border
of
the
orb
pluto

a
circular
mountain
situated
in
north
lat
and
east
long
its
circle
is
fifty
miles
long
and
thirty
wide
barbicane
regretted
not
passing
perpendicularly
over
this
vast
opening
there
was
an
abyss
to
see
perhaps
some
mysterious
phenomenon
to
become
acquainted
with
but
the
course
of
the
projectile
could
not
be
guided
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
submit
a
balloon
could
not
be
guided
much
less
a
projectile
when
you
are
inside
about
the
northern
limit
of
the
sea
of
rains
was
at
last
passed
mounts
la
condamine
and
fontenelle
remained
the
one
on
the
left
the
other
on
the
right
that
part
of
the
disc
starting
from
the
degree
became
absolutely
mountainous
the
telescopes
brought
it
to
within
one
league
an
inferior
distance
to
that
between
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
and
the
sea
level
all
this
region
was
bristling
with
peaks
and
amphitheatres
mount
philolaus
rose
about
the
degree
to
a
height
of
metres
opening
an
elliptical
crater
sixteen
leagues
long
and
four
wide
then
the
disc
seen
from
that
distance
presented
an
exceedingly
strange
aspect
the
landscapes
were
very
different
to
earthly
ones
and
also
very
inferior
the
moon
having
no
atmosphere
this
absence
of
vaporous
covering
had
consequences
already
pointed
out
there
is
no
twilight
on
its
surface
night
following
day
and
day
following
night
with
the
suddenness
of
a
lamp
extinguished
or
lighted
in
profound
darkness
there
is
no
transition
from
cold
to
heat
the
temperature
falls
in
one
instant
from
boiling
water
heat
to
the
cold
of
space
another
consequence
of
this
absence
of
air
is
the
following
absolute
darkness
reigns
where
the
sun
rays
do
not
penetrate
what
is
called
diffused
light
upon
the
earth
the
luminous
matter
that
the
air
holds
in
suspension
which
creates
twilights
and
dawns
which
produces
shadows
penumbrae
and
all
the
magic
of
the
does
not
exist
upon
the
moon
hence
the
harshness
of
contrasts
that
only
admit
two
colours
black
and
white
if
a
selenite
shades
his
eyes
from
the
solar
rays
the
sky
appears
absolutely
dark
and
the
stars
shine
as
in
the
darkest
nights
the
impression
produced
on
barbicane
and
his
two
friends
by
this
strange
state
of
things
may
well
be
imagined
they
did
not
know
how
to
use
their
eyes
they
could
no
longer
seize
the
respective
distances
in
perspective
a
lunar
landscape
which
does
not
soften
the
phenomenon
of
the
could
not
be
painted
by
a
of
the
earth
it
would
be
nothing
but
blots
of
ink
upon
white
paper
this
aspect
of
things
did
not
alter
even
when
the
projectile
then
at
the
altitude
of
the
degree
was
only
separated
from
the
moon
by
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
not
even
when
at
it
passed
at
less
than
miles
from
the
mountain
of
gioja
a
distance
which
the
telescopes
reduced
to
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
have
touched
the
moon
it
appeared
impossible
that
before
long
the
projectile
should
not
knock
against
it
if
only
at
the
north
pole
where
the
brilliant
mountains
were
clearly
outlined
against
the
dark
background
of
the
sky
michel
ardan
wanted
to
open
one
of
the
and
jump
upon
the
lunar
surface
what
was
a
fall
of
twelve
leagues
he
thought
nothing
of
that
it
would
however
have
been
a
useless
attempt
for
if
the
projectile
was
not
going
to
reach
any
point
on
the
satellite
michel
would
have
been
hurled
along
by
its
movement
and
not
have
reached
it
either
at
that
moment
the
lunar
pole
appeared
only
half
the
disc
brilliantly
lighted
appeared
to
the
travellers
whilst
the
other
half
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
projectile
suddenly
passed
the
line
of
demarcation
between
intense
light
and
absolute
darkness
and
was
suddenly
plunged
into
the
profoundest
night
chapter
xiv
a
night
of
three
hundred
and
hours
and
a
half
at
the
moment
this
phenomenon
took
place
the
projectile
was
grazing
the
moon
north
pole
at
less
that
miles
distance
a
few
seconds
had
therefore
sufficed
to
plunge
it
into
the
absolute
darkness
of
space
the
transition
had
taken
place
so
rapidly
without
gradations
of
light
or
attenuation
of
the
luminous
undulations
that
the
orb
seemed
to
have
been
blown
out
by
a
powerful
gust
the
moon
has
melted
disappeared
cried
michel
ardan
in
fact
no
ray
of
light
or
shade
had
appeared
on
the
disc
formerly
so
brilliant
the
obscurity
was
complete
and
rendered
deeper
still
by
the
shining
of
the
stars
it
was
the
darkness
of
lunar
night
which
lasts
hours
and
a
half
on
each
point
of
the
disc
a
long
night
the
result
of
the
equality
of
the
movements
of
translation
and
rotation
of
the
moon
the
one
upon
herself
the
other
round
the
earth
the
projectile
in
the
satellite
cone
of
shadow
was
no
longer
under
the
action
of
the
solar
rays
in
the
interior
darkness
was
therefore
complete
the
travellers
could
no
longer
see
one
another
hence
came
the
necessity
to
lighten
this
darkness
however
desirous
barbicane
might
be
to
economise
the
gas
of
which
he
had
so
small
a
reserve
he
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
it
for
artificial
light
an
expensive
brilliancy
which
the
sun
then
refused
the
devil
take
the
radiant
orb
cried
michel
ardan
he
is
going
to
force
us
to
spend
our
gas
instead
of
giving
us
his
rays
for
nothing
we
must
not
accuse
the
sun
said
nicholl
it
is
not
his
fault
it
is
the
moon
fault
for
coming
and
putting
herself
like
a
screen
between
us
and
him
it
the
sun
said
michel
again
it
the
moon
retorted
nicholl
an
idle
dispute
began
which
barbicane
put
an
end
to
by
saying
my
friends
it
is
neither
the
fault
of
the
sun
nor
the
moon
it
is
the
projectile
fault
for
deviating
from
its
course
instead
of
rigorously
following
it
or
to
be
juster
still
it
is
the
fault
of
that
unfortunate
asteroid
which
so
deplorably
altered
our
first
direction
good
answered
michel
ardan
as
that
business
is
settled
let
us
have
our
breakfast
after
a
night
entirely
passed
in
making
observations
we
want
something
to
set
us
to
rights
a
little
this
proposition
met
with
no
contradiction
michel
prepared
the
repast
in
a
few
minutes
but
they
ate
for
the
sake
of
eating
they
drank
without
toasts
or
hurrahs
the
bold
travellers
borne
away
into
the
darkness
of
space
without
their
accustomed
escort
of
rays
felt
a
vague
uneasiness
invade
their
hearts
the
farouche
darkness
so
dear
to
the
pen
of
victor
hugo
surrounded
them
on
all
sides
in
the
meantime
they
talked
about
this
interminable
night
hours
or
nearly
days
long
which
physical
laws
have
imposed
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
barbicane
gave
his
friends
some
explanation
of
the
causes
and
consequences
of
this
curious
phenomenon
curious
it
certainly
is
said
he
for
if
each
hemisphere
of
the
moon
is
deprived
of
solar
light
for
fifteen
days
the
one
over
which
we
are
moving
at
this
moment
does
not
even
enjoy
during
its
long
night
a
sight
of
the
earth
in
a
word
there
is
no
moon
applying
that
qualification
to
our
spheroid
except
for
one
side
of
the
disc
now
if
it
was
the
same
upon
earth
if
for
example
europe
never
saw
the
moon
and
she
was
only
visible
at
the
antipodes
you
can
figure
to
yourselves
the
astonishment
of
a
european
on
arriving
in
australia
they
would
make
the
voyage
for
nothing
but
to
go
and
see
the
moon
answered
michel
well
resumed
barbicane
that
astonishment
is
reserved
to
the
selenite
who
inhabits
the
opposite
side
of
the
moon
to
the
earth
a
side
for
ever
invisible
to
our
of
the
terrestrial
globe
and
which
we
should
have
seen
added
nicholl
if
we
had
arrived
here
at
the
epoch
when
the
moon
is
new
that
is
to
say
a
fortnight
later
to
make
amends
resumed
barbicane
an
inhabitant
of
the
visible
face
is
singularly
favoured
by
nature
to
the
detriment
on
the
invisible
face
the
latter
as
you
see
has
dark
nights
of
hours
long
without
a
ray
of
light
to
penetrate
the
obscurity
the
other
on
the
contrary
when
the
sun
which
has
lighted
him
for
a
fortnight
sets
under
the
horizon
sees
on
the
opposite
horizon
a
splendid
orb
rise
it
is
the
earth
thirteen
times
larger
than
that
moon
which
we
know
the
earth
which
is
developed
to
a
diameter
of
two
degrees
and
which
sheds
a
light
thirteen
times
greater
which
no
atmosphere
qualifies
the
earth
which
only
disappears
when
the
sun
reappears
a
fine
sentence
said
michel
ardan
rather
academical
perhaps
it
follows
resumed
barbicane
nowise
put
out
that
the
visible
face
of
the
disc
must
be
very
agreeable
to
inhabit
as
it
is
always
lighted
by
the
sun
or
the
moon
but
said
nicholl
this
advantage
must
be
quite
compensated
by
the
unbearable
heat
which
this
light
must
cause
this
inconvenience
is
the
same
under
two
faces
for
the
light
reflected
by
the
earth
is
evidently
deprived
of
heat
however
this
invisible
face
is
still
more
deprived
of
heat
than
the
visible
face
i
say
that
for
you
nicholl
michel
would
probably
not
understand
thank
you
said
michel
in
fact
resumed
barbicane
when
the
invisible
face
receives
the
solar
light
and
heat
the
moon
is
new
that
is
to
say
that
she
is
in
conjunction
that
she
is
situated
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
she
is
then
on
account
of
the
situation
which
she
occupies
in
opposition
when
she
is
full
nearer
the
sun
by
the
double
of
her
distance
from
the
earth
now
this
distance
may
be
estimated
at
the
part
of
that
which
separates
the
sun
and
the
earth
or
in
round
numbers
at
two
hundred
thousand
leagues
therefore
this
visible
face
is
nearer
the
sun
by
two
hundred
thousand
leagues
when
it
receives
his
rays
quite
right
replied
nicholl
whilst
resumed
barbicane
allow
me
said
michel
interrupting
his
grave
companion
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
go
on
with
the
explanation
why
to
prove
that
i
have
understood
go
on
then
said
barbicane
smiling
whilst
said
michel
imitating
the
tone
and
gestures
of
president
barbicane
when
the
visible
face
of
the
moon
is
lighted
by
the
sun
the
moon
is
full
that
is
to
say
situated
with
regard
to
the
earth
the
opposite
to
the
sun
the
distance
which
separates
it
from
the
radiant
orb
is
then
increased
in
round
numbers
by
leagues
and
the
heat
which
it
receives
must
be
rather
less
well
done
exclaimed
barbicane
do
you
know
michel
for
an
artist
you
are
intelligent
yes
answered
michel
carelessly
we
are
all
intelligent
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
barbicane
shook
hands
gravely
with
his
amiable
companion
and
went
on
enumerating
the
few
advantages
reserved
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
visible
face
amongst
others
he
quoted
the
observations
of
the
sun
eclipses
which
can
only
be
seen
from
one
side
of
the
lunar
disc
because
the
moon
must
be
in
opposition
before
they
can
take
place
these
eclipses
caused
by
the
interposition
of
the
earth
between
the
sun
and
the
moon
may
last
two
hours
during
which
on
account
of
the
rays
refracted
by
its
atmosphere
the
terrestrial
globe
can
only
appear
like
a
black
spot
upon
the
sun
then
said
nicholl
the
invisible
hemisphere
is
very
by
nature
yes
answered
barbicane
but
not
the
whole
of
it
by
a
certain
movement
of
liberation
a
sort
of
balancing
on
its
centre
the
moon
presents
more
than
the
half
of
her
disc
to
the
earth
she
is
like
a
pendulum
the
centre
of
gravity
of
which
is
towards
the
terrestrial
globe
and
which
oscillates
regularly
whence
comes
that
oscillation
because
her
movement
of
rotation
on
her
axis
is
animated
with
uniform
velocity
whilst
her
movement
of
translation
following
an
elliptical
orb
round
the
earth
is
not
at
the
perigee
the
velocity
of
translation
is
greater
and
the
moon
shows
a
certain
portion
of
her
western
border
at
her
apogee
the
velocity
of
rotation
is
greater
and
a
morsel
of
her
eastern
border
appears
it
is
a
strip
of
about
eight
degrees
which
appears
sometimes
on
the
west
sometimes
on
the
east
the
result
is
therefore
that
of
a
thousand
parts
the
moon
shows
five
hundred
and
no
matter
answered
michel
if
we
ever
become
selenites
we
will
inhabit
the
visible
face
i
like
light
unless
replied
nicholl
the
atmosphere
should
be
condensed
on
the
other
side
as
certain
astronomers
pretend
that
is
a
consideration
answered
michel
simply
in
the
meantime
breakfast
was
concluded
and
the
observers
resumed
their
posts
they
tried
to
see
through
the
dark
by
putting
out
all
light
in
the
projectile
but
not
one
luminous
atom
penetrated
the
obscurity
one
inexplicable
fact
preoccupied
barbicane
how
was
it
that
though
the
projectile
had
been
so
near
the
moon
within
a
distance
of
miles
it
had
not
fallen
upon
her
if
its
speed
had
been
enormous
he
would
have
understood
why
it
had
not
fallen
but
with
a
relatively
slight
speed
the
resistance
to
lunar
attraction
could
not
be
explained
was
the
projectile
under
the
influence
of
some
strange
force
did
some
body
maintain
it
in
the
ether
it
was
henceforth
evident
that
it
would
not
touch
any
point
upon
the
moon
where
was
it
going
was
it
going
farther
away
from
or
nearer
to
the
disc
was
it
carried
along
in
the
gloom
across
infinitude
how
were
they
to
know
how
calculate
in
the
dark
all
these
questions
made
barbicane
anxious
but
he
could
not
solve
them
in
fact
the
invisible
orb
was
there
perhaps
at
a
distance
of
some
leagues
only
but
neither
his
companions
nor
he
could
any
longer
see
it
if
any
noise
was
made
on
its
surface
they
could
not
hear
it
the
air
that
vehicle
of
transmission
was
wanting
to
convey
to
them
the
groans
of
that
moon
which
the
arabian
legends
make
a
man
already
but
still
palpitating
it
will
be
agreed
that
it
was
enough
to
exasperate
the
most
patient
observers
it
was
precisely
the
unknown
hemisphere
that
was
hidden
from
their
eyes
that
face
which
a
fortnight
sooner
or
a
fortnight
later
had
been
or
would
be
splendidly
lighted
up
by
the
solar
rays
was
then
lost
in
absolute
darkness
where
would
the
projectile
be
in
another
fortnight
where
would
the
hazards
of
attraction
have
taken
it
who
could
say
it
is
generally
admitted
that
the
invisible
hemisphere
of
the
moon
is
by
its
constitution
absolutely
similar
to
the
visible
hemisphere
of
it
is
seen
in
those
movements
of
libration
barbicane
spoke
of
now
upon
the
surface
seen
there
were
only
plains
and
mountains
amphitheatres
and
craters
like
those
on
the
maps
they
could
there
imagine
the
same
arid
and
dead
nature
and
yet
supposing
the
atmosphere
to
have
taken
refuge
upon
that
face
suppose
that
with
the
air
water
had
given
life
to
these
regenerated
continents
suppose
that
vegetation
still
persists
there
suppose
that
animals
people
these
continents
and
seas
suppose
that
man
still
lives
under
those
conditions
of
habitability
how
many
questions
there
were
it
would
have
been
interesting
to
solve
what
solutions
might
have
been
drawn
from
the
contemplation
of
that
hemisphere
what
delight
it
would
have
been
to
glance
at
that
world
which
no
human
eye
has
seen
the
disappointment
of
the
travellers
in
the
midst
of
this
darkness
may
be
imagined
all
observation
of
the
lunar
disc
was
prevented
the
constellations
alone
were
visible
and
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
no
astronomers
neither
faye
chacornac
nor
the
secchi
had
ever
been
in
such
favourable
conditions
to
observe
them
in
fact
nothing
could
equal
the
splendour
of
this
starry
world
bathed
in
limpid
ether
diamonds
set
in
the
celestial
vault
threw
out
superb
flames
one
look
could
take
in
the
firmament
from
the
southern
cross
to
the
north
star
those
two
constellations
which
will
in
years
on
account
of
the
succession
of
equinoxes
resign
their
of
polar
stars
the
one
to
canopus
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
other
to
wega
in
the
northern
imagination
lost
itself
in
this
sublime
infinitude
amidst
which
the
projectile
was
moving
like
a
new
star
created
by
the
hand
of
man
from
natural
causes
these
constellations
shone
with
a
soft
lustre
they
did
not
twinkle
because
there
was
no
atmosphere
to
intervene
with
its
strata
unequally
dense
and
of
different
degrees
of
humidity
which
causes
this
scintillation
the
travellers
long
watched
the
constellated
firmament
upon
which
the
vast
screen
of
the
moon
made
an
enormous
black
hole
but
a
painful
sensation
at
length
drew
them
from
their
contemplation
this
was
an
intense
cold
which
soon
covered
the
glasses
of
the
with
a
thick
coating
of
ice
the
sun
no
longer
warmed
the
projectile
with
his
rays
and
it
gradually
lost
the
heat
stored
up
in
its
walls
this
heat
was
by
radiation
rapidly
evaporated
into
space
and
a
considerable
lowering
of
the
temperature
was
the
result
the
interior
humidity
was
changed
into
ice
by
contact
with
the
and
prevented
all
observation
nicholl
consulting
the
thermometer
said
that
it
had
fallen
to
centigrade
below
zero
fahr
therefore
notwithstanding
every
reason
for
being
economical
barbicane
was
obliged
to
seek
heat
as
well
as
light
from
gas
the
low
temperature
of
the
bullet
was
no
longer
bearable
its
occupants
would
have
been
frozen
to
death
we
will
not
complain
about
the
monotony
of
the
journey
said
michel
ardan
what
variety
we
have
had
in
temperature
at
all
events
at
times
we
have
been
blinded
with
light
and
saturated
with
heat
like
the
indians
of
the
pampas
now
we
are
plunged
into
profound
darkness
amidst
boreal
cold
like
the
esquimaux
of
the
pole
no
indeed
we
have
no
right
to
complain
and
nature
has
done
many
things
in
our
honour
but
asked
nicholl
what
is
the
exterior
temperature
precisely
that
of
planetary
space
answered
barbicane
then
resumed
michel
ardan
would
not
this
be
an
opportunity
for
making
that
experiment
we
could
not
attempt
when
we
were
bathed
in
the
solar
rays
now
or
never
answered
barbicane
for
we
are
usefully
situated
in
order
to
verify
the
temperature
of
space
and
see
whether
the
calculations
of
fourier
or
pouillet
are
correct
any
way
it
is
cold
enough
said
michel
look
at
the
interior
humidity
condensing
on
the
if
this
fall
continues
the
vapour
of
our
respiration
will
fall
around
us
in
snow
let
us
get
a
thermometer
said
barbicane
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
an
ordinary
thermometer
would
have
given
no
result
under
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
going
to
be
exposed
the
mercury
would
have
frozen
in
its
cup
for
it
does
not
keep
liquid
below
below
zero
but
barbicane
had
provided
himself
with
a
spirit
thermometer
on
the
walferdin
system
which
gives
the
minima
of
excessively
low
temperature
before
beginning
the
experiment
this
instrument
was
compared
with
an
ordinary
thermometer
and
barbicane
prepared
to
employ
it
how
shall
we
manage
it
asked
nicholl
nothing
is
easier
answered
michel
ardan
who
was
never
at
a
loss
open
the
rapidly
throw
out
the
instrument
it
will
follow
the
projectile
with
exemplary
docility
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
take
it
in
with
your
hand
asked
barbicane
with
my
hand
answered
michel
well
then
my
friend
do
not
try
it
said
barbicane
for
the
hand
you
draw
back
will
be
only
a
stump
frozen
and
deformed
by
the
frightful
cold
really
you
would
feel
the
sensation
of
a
terrible
burn
like
one
made
with
a
iron
for
the
same
thing
happens
when
heat
is
brutally
abstracted
from
our
body
as
when
it
is
inserted
besides
i
am
not
sure
that
objects
thrown
out
still
follow
us
why
said
nicholl
because
if
we
are
passing
through
any
atmosphere
however
slightly
dense
these
objects
will
be
delayed
now
the
darkness
prevents
us
verifying
whether
they
still
float
around
us
therefore
in
order
not
to
risk
our
thermometer
we
will
tie
something
to
it
and
so
easily
pull
it
back
into
the
interior
barbicane
advice
was
followed
nicholl
threw
the
instrument
out
of
the
holding
it
by
a
very
short
cord
so
that
it
could
be
rapidly
drawn
in
the
window
was
only
open
one
second
and
yet
that
one
second
was
enough
to
allow
the
interior
of
the
projectile
to
become
frightfully
cold
diables
cried
michel
ardan
it
is
cold
enough
here
to
freeze
white
bears
barbicane
let
go
by
more
than
sufficient
time
to
allow
the
instrument
to
descend
to
the
level
of
the
temperature
of
space
the
thermometer
was
then
rapidly
drawn
in
barbicane
calculated
the
quantity
of
mercury
spilt
into
the
little
phial
soldered
to
the
lower
part
of
the
instrument
and
said
one
hundred
and
forty
degrees
centigrade
below
zero
fahr
pouillet
was
right
not
fourier
such
was
the
frightful
temperature
of
sidereal
space
such
perhaps
that
of
the
lunar
continents
when
the
orb
of
night
loses
by
radiation
all
the
heat
which
she
absorbs
during
the
fifteen
days
of
sunshine
chapter
xv
hyperbola
or
parabola
our
readers
will
probably
be
astonished
that
barbicane
and
his
companions
were
so
little
occupied
with
the
future
in
store
for
them
in
their
metal
prison
carried
along
in
the
infinitude
of
ether
instead
of
asking
themselves
where
they
were
going
they
lost
their
time
in
making
experiments
just
as
if
they
had
been
comfortably
installed
in
their
own
studies
it
might
be
answered
that
men
so
were
above
such
considerations
that
such
little
things
did
not
make
them
uneasy
and
that
they
had
something
else
to
do
than
to
think
about
their
future
the
truth
is
that
they
were
not
masters
of
their
projectile
that
they
could
neither
stop
it
nor
alter
its
direction
a
seaman
can
direct
the
head
of
his
ship
as
he
pleases
an
a√´ronaut
can
give
his
balloon
vertical
movement
they
on
the
contrary
had
no
authority
over
their
vehicle
no
manoeuvre
was
possible
to
them
hence
their
not
troubling
themselves
or
let
things
go
state
of
mind
where
were
they
at
that
moment
during
that
day
called
upon
earth
the
sixth
of
december
certainly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
moon
and
even
near
enough
for
her
to
appear
like
a
vast
black
screen
upon
the
firmament
as
to
the
distance
which
separated
them
it
was
impossible
to
estimate
it
the
projectile
kept
up
by
inexplicable
forces
has
grazed
the
north
pole
of
the
satellite
at
less
than
distance
but
had
that
distance
increased
or
diminished
since
they
had
been
in
the
cone
of
shadow
there
was
no
landmark
by
which
to
estimate
either
the
direction
or
the
velocity
of
the
projectile
perhaps
it
was
going
rapidly
away
from
the
disc
and
would
soon
leave
the
pure
shadow
perhaps
on
the
contrary
it
was
approaching
it
and
would
before
long
strike
against
some
elevated
peak
in
the
invisible
atmosphere
which
would
have
terminated
the
journey
doubtless
to
the
detriment
of
the
travellers
a
discussion
began
upon
this
subject
and
michel
ardan
always
rich
in
explanations
gave
out
the
opinion
that
the
bullet
restrained
by
lunar
attraction
would
end
by
falling
on
the
moon
like
an
a√´rolite
on
to
the
surface
of
the
terrestrial
globe
in
the
first
place
answered
barbicane
all
a√´rolites
do
not
fall
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
only
a
small
proportion
do
so
therefore
if
we
are
a√´rolites
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
we
shall
fall
upon
the
moon
still
answered
michel
if
we
get
near
enough
error
replied
barbicane
have
you
not
seen
shooting
stars
by
thousands
in
the
sky
at
certain
epochs
yes
well
those
stars
or
rather
corpuscles
only
shine
by
rubbing
against
the
atmospheric
strata
now
if
they
pass
through
the
atmosphere
they
pass
at
less
than
miles
from
our
globe
and
yet
they
rarely
fall
it
is
the
same
with
our
projectile
it
may
approach
very
near
the
moon
and
yet
not
fall
upon
it
but
then
asked
michel
i
am
curious
to
know
how
our
vehicle
would
behave
in
space
i
only
see
two
hypotheses
answered
barbicane
after
some
reflection
what
are
they
the
projectile
has
the
choice
between
two
mathematical
curves
and
it
will
follow
the
one
or
the
other
according
to
the
velocity
with
which
it
is
animated
and
which
i
can
not
now
estimate
yes
it
will
either
describe
a
parabola
or
an
hyperbola
yes
answered
barbicane
with
some
speed
it
will
describe
a
parabola
and
with
greater
speed
an
hyperbola
i
like
those
grand
words
exclaimed
michel
ardan
i
know
at
once
what
you
mean
and
what
is
your
parabola
if
you
please
my
friend
answered
the
captain
a
parabola
is
a
conic
section
arising
from
cutting
a
cone
by
a
plane
parallel
to
one
of
its
sides
oh
said
michel
in
a
satisfied
tone
it
is
about
the
same
trajectory
that
the
bomb
of
a
howitzer
describes
just
so
and
an
hyperbola
asked
michel
it
is
a
curve
formed

when

angle

than

is
it
possible
exclaimed
michel
ardan
in
the
most
serious
tone
as
if
he
had
been
informed
of
a
grave
event
then
remember
this
captain
nicholl
what
i
like
in
your
definition
of
the
hyperbola
i
was
going
to
say
of
the
hyperhumbug
is
that
it
is
still
less
easy
to
understand
than
the
word
you
pretend
to
define
nicholl
and
barbicane
paid
no
attention
to
michel
ardan
jokes
they
had
launched
into
a
scientific
discussion
they
were
eager
about
what
curve
the
projectile
would
take
one
was
for
the
hyperbola
the
other
for
the
parabola
they
gave
each
other
reasons
bristling
with
their
arguments
were
presented
in
a
language
which
made
michel
ardan
jump
the
discussion
was
lively
and
neither
of
the
adversaries
would
sacrifice
his
curve
of
predilection
this
scientific
dispute
was
prolonged
until
michel
ardan
became
impatient
and
said
i
say
cosine
do
leave
off
throwing
your
hyperbolas
and
parabolas
at
one
head
i
want
to
know
the
only
interesting
thing
about
the
business
we
shall
follow
one
or
other
of
your
curves
very
well
but
where
will
they
take
us
to
nowhere
answered
nicholl
how
nowhere
evidently
they
are
unfinished
curves
prolonged
indefinitely
ah
what
does
it
matter
about
hyperbola
or
parabola
if
they
both
carry
us
indefinitely
into
space
barbicane
and
nicholl
could
not
help
laughing
they
cared
for
art
for
its
own
sake
never
had
more
useless
question
been
discussed
at
a
more
inopportune
moment
the
fatal
truth
was
that
the
projectile
whether
hyperbolically
or
parabolically
carried
along
would
never
strike
against
either
the
earth
or
the
moon
what
would
become
of
these
bold
travellers
in
the
most
immediate
future
if
they
did
not
die
of
hunger
or
thirst
they
would
in
a
few
days
when
gas
failed
them
die
for
want
of
air
if
the
cold
had
not
killed
them
first
still
although
it
was
so
important
to
economise
gas
the
excessive
lowness
of
the
surrounding
temperature
forced
them
to
consume
a
certain
quantity
they
could
not
do
without
either
its
light
or
heat
happily
the
caloric
developed
by
the
reiset
and
regnault
apparatus
slightly
elevated
the
temperature
of
the
projectile
and
without
spending
much
they
could
raise
it
to
a
bearable
degree
in
the
meantime
observation
through
the
had
become
very
difficult
the
steam
inside
the
bullet
condensed
upon
the
panes
and
froze
immediately
they
were
obliged
to
destroy
the
opacity
of
the
glass
by
constant
rubbing
however
they
could
record
several
phenomena
of
the
highest
interest
in
fact
if
the
invisible
disc
had
any
atmosphere
the
shooting
stars
would
be
seen
passing
through
it
if
the
projectile
itself
passed
through
the
fluid
strata
might
it
not
hear
some
noise
echoed
a
storm
for
instance
an
avalanche
or
a
volcano
in
activity
should
they
not
see
the
intense
fulgurations
of
a
burning
mountain
such
facts
carefully
recorded
would
have
singularly
elucidated
the
obscure
question
of
the
lunar
constitution
thus
barbicane
and
nicholl
standing
like
astronomers
at
their
watched
with
scrupulous
patience
but
until
then
the
disc
remained
mute
and
dark
it
did
not
answer
the
multifarious
interrogations
of
these
ardent
minds
this
provoked
from
michel
a
reflection
that
seemed
correct
enough
if
ever
we
recommence
our
journey
we
shall
do
well
to
choose
the
epoch
when
the
moon
is
new
true
answered
nicholl
that
circumstance
would
have
been
more
favourable
i
agree
that
the
moon
bathed
in
sunlight
would
not
be
visible
during
the
passage
but
on
the
other
hand
the
earth
would
be
full
and
if
we
are
dragged
round
the
moon
like
we
are
now
we
should
at
least
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
the
invisible
disc
magnificently
lighted
up
well
said
nicholl
replied
michel
ardan
what
do
you
think
about
it
barbicane
i
think
this
answered
the
grave
president
if
ever
we
recommence
this
journey
we
shall
start
at
the
same
epoch
and
under
the
same
circumstances
suppose
we
had
reached
our
goal
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
find
the
continents
in
full
daylight
instead
of
dark
night
would
not
our
first
installation
have
been
made
under
better
circumstances
yes
evidently
as
to
the
invisible
side
we
could
have
visited
that
in
our
exploring
expeditions
on
the
lunar
globe
so
therefore
the
time
of
the
full
moon
was
well
chosen
but
we
ought
to
have
reached
our
goal
and
in
order
to
have
reached
it
we
ought
not
to
have
deviated
from
our
road
there
is
no
answer
to
make
to
that
said
michel
ardan
yet
we
have
passed
a
fine
opportunity
for
seeing
the
moon
who
knows
whether
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
planets
are
not
more
advanced
than
the
of
the
earth
on
the
subject
of
their
satellites
the
following
answer
might
easily
have
been
given
to
michel
remark
yes
other
satellites
on
account
of
their
greater
proximity
have
made
the
study
of
them
easier
the
inhabitants
of
saturn
jupiter
and
uranus
if
they
exist
have
been
able
to
establish
communication
with
their
moons
much
more
easily
the
four
satellites
of
jupiter
gravitate
at
a
distance
of
leagues
leagues
leagues
and
leagues
but
these
distances
are
reckoned
from
the
centre
of
the
planet
and
by
taking
away
the
radius
which
is
to
leagues
it
will
be
seen
that
the
first
satellite
is
at
a
much
less
distance
from
the
surface
of
jupiter
than
the
moon
is
from
the
centre
of
the
earth
of
the
eight
moons
of
saturn
four
are
near
diana
is
leagues
off
thetys
leagues
enceladus
leagues
and
lastly
mimas
is
at
an
average
distance
of
leagues
only
of
the
eighteen
satellites
of
uranus
the
first
ariel
is
only
leagues
from
the
planet
therefore
upon
the
surface
of
those
three
stars
an
experiment
analogous
to
that
of
president
barbicane
would
have
presented
less
difficulties
if
therefore
their
inhabitants
have
attempted
the
enterprise
they
have
perhaps
acquainted
themselves
with
the
constitution
of
the
half
of
the
disc
which
their
satellite
hides
eternally
from
their
eyes
but
if
they
have
never
left
their
planet
they
do
not
know
more
about
them
than
the
astronomers
of
the
earth
in
the
meantime
the
bullet
was
describing
in
the
darkness
that
incalculable
trajectory
which
no
landmark
allowed
them
to
find
out
was
its
direction
altered
either
under
the
influence
of
lunar
attraction
or
under
the
action
of
some
unknown
orb
barbicane
could
not
tell
but
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
relative
position
of
the
vehicle
and
barbicane
became
aware
of
it
about
the
change
consisted
in
this
that
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
was
turned
towards
the
surface
of
the
moon
and
kept
itself
perpendicular
with
its
axis
the
attraction
or
gravitation
had
caused
this
modification
the
heaviest
part
of
the
bullet
inclined
towards
the
invisible
disc
exactly
as
if
it
had
fallen
towards
it
was
it
falling
then
were
the
travellers
at
last
about
to
reach
their
desired
goal
no
and
the
observation
of
one
landmark
inexplicable
in
itself
demonstrated
to
barbicane
that
his
projectile
was
not
nearing
the
moon
and
that
it
was
following
an
almost
concentric
curve
this
was
a
flash
of
light
which
nicholl
signalised
all
at
once
on
the
limit
of
the
horizon
formed
by
the
black
disc
this
point
could
not
be
mistaken
for
a
star
it
was
a
reddish
flame
which
grew
gradually
larger
an
incontestable
proof
that
the
projectile
was
getting
nearer
it
and
not
falling
normally
upon
the
surface
of
the
satellite
a
volcano
it
is
a
volcano
in
activity
exclaimed
nicholl
an
eruption
of
the
interior
fires
of
the
moon
that
world
then
is
not
quite
extinguished
yes
an
eruption
answered
barbicane
who
studied
the
phenomenon
carefully
through
his
what
should
it
be
if
not
a
volcano
but
then
said
michel
ardan
air
is
necessary
to
feed
that
combustion
therefore
there
is
some
atmosphere
on
that
part
of
the
moon
perhaps
so
answered
barbicane
but
not
necessarily
a
volcano
by
the
decomposition
of
certain
matters
can
furnish
itself
with
oxygen
and
so
throw
up
flames
into
the
void
it
seems
to
me
too
that
that
deflagration
has
the
intensity
and
brilliancy
of
objects
the
combustion
of
which
is
produced
in
pure
oxygen
we
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
affirm
the
existence
of
a
lunar
atmosphere
the
burning
mountain
was
situated
at
the
degree
of
south
latitude
on
the
invisible
part
of
the
disc
but
to
the
great
disappointment
of
barbicane
the
curve
that
the
projectile
described
dragged
it
away
from
the
point
signalised
by
the
eruption
therefore
he
could
not
exactly
determine
its
nature
after
it
had
first
been
seen
this
luminous
point
disappeared
on
the
horizon
still
the
authentication
of
this
phenomenon
was
a
considerable
fact
in
selenographic
studies
it
proved
that
all
heat
had
not
yet
disappeared
from
the
interior
of
this
globe
and
where
heat
exists
who
may
affirm
that
the
vegetable
kingdom
or
even
the
animal
kingdom
itself
has
not
until
now
resisted
the
destructive
influences
the
existence
of
this
volcano
in
eruption
indisputably
established
by
earthly
was
favourable
to
the
theory
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
barbicane
became
absorbed
in
reflection
he
forgot
himself
in
a
mute
reverie
filled
with
the
mysterious
destinies
of
the
lunar
world
he
was
trying
to
connect
the
facts
observed
up
till
then
when
a
fresh
incident
recalled
him
suddenly
to
the
reality
this
incident
was
more
than
a
cosmic
phenomenon
it
was
a
threatening
danger
the
consequences
of
which
might
be
disastrous
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
ether
in
the
profound
darkness
an
enormous
mass
had
appeared
it
was
like
a
moon
but
a
burning
moon
of
almost
unbearable
brilliancy
outlined
as
it
was
on
the
total
obscurity
of
space
this
mass
of
a
circular
form
threw
such
light
that
it
filled
the
projectile
the
faces
of
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
bathed
in
its
white
waves
looked
spectral
livid
like
the
appearance
produced
by
the
artificial
light
of
alcohol
impregnated
with
salt
the
devil
cried
michel
ardan
how
hideous
we
are
whatever
is
that
wretched
moon
it
is
a
bolis
answered
barbicane
a
bolis
on
fire
in
the
void
yes
this
globe
of
fire
was
indeed
a
bolis
barbicane
was
not
mistaken
but
if
these
cosmic
meteors
seen
from
the
earth
present
an
inferior
light
to
that
of
the
moon
here
in
the
dark
ether
they
shone
magnificently
these
wandering
bodies
carry
in
themselves
the
principle
of
their
own
incandescence
the
surrounding
air
is
not
necessary
to
the
deflagration
and
indeed
if
certain
of
these
bodies
pass
through
our
atmosphere
at
two
or
three
leagues
from
the
earth
others
describe
their
trajectory
at
a
distance
the
atmosphere
can
not
reach
some
of
these
meteors
are
from
one
to
two
miles
wide
and
move
at
a
speed
of
forty
miles
a
second
following
an
inverse
direction
from
the
movement
of
the
earth
this
shooting
star
suddenly
appeared
in
the
darkness
at
a
distance
of
at
least
leagues
and
measured
according
to
barbicane
estimate
a
diameter
of
metres
it
moved
with
the
speed
of
about
thirty
leagues
a
minute
it
cut
across
the
route
of
the
projectile
and
would
reach
it
in
a
few
minutes
as
it
approached
it
grew
larger
in
an
enormous
proportion
if
possible
let
the
situation
of
the
travellers
be
imagined
it
is
impossible
to
describe
it
in
spite
of
their
courage
their
their
carelessness
of
danger
they
were
mute
motionless
with
stiffened
limbs
a
prey
to
fearful
terror
their
projectile
the
course
of
which
they
could
not
alter
was
running
straight
on
to
this
burning
mass
more
intense
than
the
open
mouth
of
a
furnace
they
seemed
to
be
rushing
towards
an
abyss
of
fire
barbicane
seized
the
hands
of
his
two
companions
and
all
three
looked
through
their
eyelids
at
the
asteroid
if
they
still
thought
at
all
they
must
have
given
themselves
up
as
lost
two
minutes
after
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
bolis
two
centuries
of
agony
the
projectile
seemed
about
to
strike
against
it
when
the
ball
of
fire
burst
like
a
bomb
but
without
making
any
noise
in
the
void
where
sound
which
is
only
the
agitation
of
the
strata
of
air
could
not
be
made
nicholl
uttered
a
cry
his
companions
and
he
rushed
to
the
what
a
spectacle
what
pen
could
describe
it
what
palette
would
be
rich
enough
in
colours
to
reproduce
its
magnificence
it
was
like
the
opening
of
a
crater
or
the
spreading
of
an
immense
fire
thousands
of
luminous

lit
up

struck

it

to

in

dispersed
it
in

so
bright
that

dragged

nicholl
to
the
window
exclaiming
the

all

across

it
an

an

they

so
superficially
obtained

they
pronounce
upon

the

the

had
just
escaped
a
terrible
danger
a
danger
quite
unforeseen
who
would
have
imagined
such
a
meeting
of
asteroids
these
wandering
bodies
might
prove
serious
perils
to
the
travellers
they
were
to
them
like
so
many

less
fortunate
than

they
could
not
avoid

did
these

complain
no
as
nature
had
given
them
the
splendid
spectacle
of
a
cosmic
meteor
shining
by
formidable
expansion
as
this
incomparable
display
of

which
no

could

had
lighted

the

it

to
be
feared
the

ought
however
to
describe
a
curve
imperturbably
determined
by
the
laws
of
mechanics
barbicane
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
this
curve
would
be
a
parabola
and
not
an
hyperbola
however
if
the
parabola
was
admitted
the
bullet
ought
soon
to
come
out
of
the
cone
of
shadow
thrown
into
the
space
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
sun
this
cone
in
fact
is
very
narrow
the
angular
diameter
of
the
moon
is
so
small
compared
to
the
diameter
of
the
orb
of
day
until
now
the
projectile
had
moved
in
profound
darkness
whatever
its
speed
had
been
and
it
could
not
have
been
slight
its
period
of
occultation
continued
that
fact
was
evident
but
perhaps
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
in
a
rigidly
parabolical
course
this
was
a
fresh
problem
which
tormented
barbicane
brain
veritably
imprisoned
as
it
was
in
a
web
of
the
unknown
which
he
could
not
disentangle
neither
of
the
travellers
thought
of
taking
a
minute
rest
each
watched
for
some
unexpected
incident
which
should
throw
a
new
light
on
their
uranographic
studies
about
five
michel
distributed
to
them
by
way
of
dinner
some
morsels
of
bread
and
cold
meat
which
were
rapidly
absorbed
whilst
no
one
thought
of
leaving
the
the
panes
of
which
were
becoming
incrusted
under
the
condensation
of
vapour
about
nicholl
armed
with
his
telescope
signalised
upon
the
southern
border
of
the
moon
and
in
the
direction
followed
by
the
projectile
a
few
brilliant
points
outlined
against
the
dark
screen
of
the
sky
they
looked
like
a
succession
of
sharp
peaks
with
profiles
in
a
tremulous
line
they
were
rather
brilliant
the
terminal
line
of
the
moon
looks
the
same
when
she
is
in
one
of
her
octants
they
could
not
be
mistaken
there
was
no
longer
any
question
of
a
simple
meteor
of
which
that
luminous
line
had
neither
the
colour
nor
the
mobility
nor
of
a
volcano
in
eruption
barbicane
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
what
it
was
the
sun
he
exclaimed
what
the
sun
answered
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
yes
my
friends
it
is
the
radiant
orb
itself
lighting
up
the
summit
of
the
mountains
situated
on
the
southern
border
of
the
moon
we
are
evidently
approaching
the
south
pole
after
having
passed
the
north
pole
answered
michel
then
we
have
been
all
round
our
satellite
yes
friend
michel
then
we
have
no
more
hyperbolas
no
more
parabolas
no
more
open
curves
to
fear
no
but
a
closed
curve
which
is
called
an
ellipsis
instead
of
being
lost
in
the
interplanetary
spaces
it
is
possible
that
the
projectile
will
describe
an
elliptical
orbit
round
the
moon
really
and
that
it
will
become
its
satellite
moon
of
the
moon
exclaimed
michel
ardan
only
i
must
tell
you
my
worthy
friend
that
we
are
none
the
less
lost
men
on
that
account
no
but
in
another
and
much
pleasanter
way
answered
the
careless
frenchman
with
his
most
amiable
smile
president
barbicane
was
right
by
describing
this
elliptical
orbit
the
projectile
was
going
to
gravitate
eternally
round
the
moon
like
a
it
was
a
new
star
added
to
the
solar
world
a
microcosm
peopled
by
three
inhabitants
whom
want
of
air
would
kill
before
long
barbicane
therefore
could
not
rejoice
at
the
position
imposed
on
the
bullet
by
the
double
influence
of
the
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
his
companions
and
he
were
again
going
to
see
the
visible
face
of
the
disc
perhaps
their
existence
would
last
long
enough
for
them
to
perceive
for
the
last
time
the
full
earth
superbly
lighted
up
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
perhaps
they
might
throw
a
last
adieu
to
the
globe
they
were
never
more
to
see
again
then
their
projectile
would
be
nothing
but
an
extinct
mass
dead
like
those
inert
asteroids
which
circulate
in
the
ether
a
single
consolation
remained
to
them
it
was
that
of
seeing
the
darkness
and
returning
to
light
it
was
that
of
again
entering
the
zones
bathed
by
solar
irradiation
in
the
meantime
the
mountains
recognised
by
barbicane
stood
out
more
and
more
from
the
dark
mass
they
were
mounts
doerfel
and
leibnitz
which
stand
on
the
southern
circumpolar
region
of
the
moon
all
the
mountains
of
the
visible
hemisphere
have
been
measured
with
perfect
exactitude
this
perfection
will
no
doubt
seem
astonishing
and
yet
the
hypsometric
methods
are
rigorous
the
altitude
of
the
lunar
mountains
may
be
no
less
exactly
determined
than
that
of
the
mountains
of
the
earth
the
method
generally
employed
is
that
of
measuring
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
mountains
whilst
taking
into
account
the
altitude
of
the
sun
at
the
moment
of
observation
this
method
also
allows
the
calculating
of
the
depth
of
craters
and
cavities
on
the
moon
galileo
used
it
and
since
boeer
and
moedler
have
employed
it
with
the
greatest
success
another
method
called
the
tangent
radii
may
also
be
used
for
measuring
lunar
reliefs
it
is
applied
at
the
moment
when
the
mountains
form
luminous
points
on
the
line
of
separation
between
light
and
darkness
which
shine
on
the
dark
part
of
the
disc
these
luminous
points
are
produced
by
the
solar
rays
above
those
which
determine
the
limit
of
the
phase
therefore
the
measure
of
the
dark
interval
which
the
luminous
point
and
the
luminous
part
of
the
phase
leave
between
them
gives
exactly
the
height
of
the
point
but
it
will
be
seen
that
this
method
can
only
be
applied
to
the
mountains
near
the
line
of
separation
of
darkness
and
light
a
third
method
consists
in
measuring
the
profile
of
the
lunar
mountains
outlined
on
the
background
by
means
of
a
micrometer
but
it
is
only
applicable
to
the
heights
near
the
border
of
the
orb
in
any
case
it
will
be
remarked
that
this
measurement
of
shadows
intervals
or
profiles
can
only
be
made
when
the
solar
rays
strike
the
moon
obliquely
in
relation
to
the
observer
when
they
strike
her
directly
in
a
word
when
she
is
full
all
shadow
is
imperiously
banished
from
her
disc
and
observation
is
no
longer
possible
galileo
after
recognising
the
existence
of
the
lunar
mountains
was
the
first
to
employ
the
method
of
calculating
their
heights
by
the
shadows
they
throw
he
attributed
to
them
as
it
has
already
been
shown
an
average
of
yards
hevelius
singularly
reduced
these
figures
which
riccioli
on
the
contrary
doubled
all
these
measures
were
exaggerated
herschel
with
his
more
perfect
instruments
approached
nearer
the
hypsometric
truth
but
it
must
be
finally
sought
in
the
accounts
of
modern
observers
boeer
and
moedler
the
most
perfect
selenographers
in
the
whole
world
have
measured
lunar
mountains
it
results
from
their
calculations
that
of
these
mountains
rise
above
metres
and
above
the
highest
summit
of
the
moon
measures
metres
it
is
therefore
inferior
to
those
of
the
earth
of
which
some
are
yards
higher
but
one
remark
must
be
made
if
the
respective
volumes
of
the
two
orbs
are
compared
the
lunar
mountains
are
relatively
higher
than
the
terrestrial
the
lunar
ones
form
of
the
diameter
of
the
moon
and
the
terrestrial
only
form
of
the
diameter
of
the
earth
for
a
terrestrial
mountain
to
attain
the
relative
proportions
of
a
lunar
mountain
its
perpendicular
height
ought
to
be
leagues
now
the
highest
is
not
four
miles
thus
then
to
proceed
by
comparison
the
chain
of
the
himalayas
counts
three
peaks
higher
than
the
lunar
ones
mount
everest
kunchinjuga
and
dwalagiri
mounts
doerfel
and
leibnitz
on
the
moon
are
as
high
as
jewahir
in
the
same
chain

the

such
are
the
points
of

that
allow
the
appreciation
of
the

of

mountains
now
the
trajectory
followed
by
the
projectile
dragged
it
precisely
towards
that
mountainous
region
of
the
southern
hemisphere
where
rise
the
finest
specimens

chapter

tycho
at
the
projectile
passed
the
south
pole
at
less
than
thirty
miles
a
distance
equal
to
that
already
reached
at
the
north
pole
the
elliptical

was
therefore
being
rigorously
described
at
that
moment
the
travellers
the
beneficent
sunshine
they
saw
once
more
the
stars
moving
slowly
from
east
to
west
the
radiant
orb
was
saluted
with
a
triple
hurrah
with
its
light
came
also
its
heat
which
soon
pierced
the
middle
walls
the
windows
resumed
their
accustomed
transparency
their
layer
of
ice
melted
as
if
by
enchantment
the
gas
was
immediately
extinguished
by
way
of
economy
the

apparatus
alone
was
to
consume
its
habitual
quantity
ah
said
nicholl
sunshine
is
good
how
impatiently
after
their
long
nights
the
selenites
must
await
the
reappearance
of
the
orb
of
day
yes
answered
michel
ardan
imbibing
as
it
were
the
brilliant
ether
light
and
heat
all
life
is
in
them
at
that
moment
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
moved
slightly
from
the
lunar
surface
in
order
to
describe
a
rather
long
elliptical
orbit
from
that
point
if
the
earth
had
been
full
barbicane
and
his
friends
could
have
seen
it
again
but
drowned
in
the
sun
irradiation
it
remained
absolutely
invisible
another
spectacle
attracted
their
eyes
presented
by
the
southern
region
of
the
moon
brought
by
the
telescopes
to
within
they
left
the
no
more
and
noted
all
the
details
of
the
strange
continent
mounts
doerfel
and
leibnitz
formed
two
separate
groups
stretching
nearly
to
the
south
pole
the
former
group
extends
from
the
pole
to
the
parallel
on
the
eastern
part
of
the
orb
the
second
starting
from
the
eastern
border
stretches
from
the
degree
of
latitude
to
the
pole
on
their
ridge
appeared
dazzling
sheets
of
light
like
those
signalised
by
father
secchi
with
more
certainty
than
the
illustrious
roman
astronomer
barbicane
was
enabled
to
establish
their
nature
it
is
snow
cried
he
snow
echoed
nicholl
yes
nicholl
snow
the
surface
of
which
is
profoundly
frozen
look
how
it
reflects
the
luminous
rays
cooled
lava
would
not
give
so
intense
a
reflection
therefore
there
is
water
and
air
upon
the
moon
as
little
as
you
like
but
the
fact
can
no
longer
be
contested
no
it
could
not
be
and
if
ever
barbicane
saw
the
earth
again
his
notes
would
testify
to
this
fact
important
in
selenographic
observations
these
mounts
doerfel
and
leibnitz
arose
in
the
midst
of
plains
of
moderate
extent
bounded
by
an
indefinite
succession
of
amphitheatres
and
circular
ramparts
these
two
chains
are
the
only
ones
which
are
met
with
in
the
region
of
amphitheatres
relatively
they
are
not
very
broken
and
only
throw
out
here
and
there
some
sharp
peaks
the
highest
of
which
measures
metres
the
projectile
hung
high
above
all
this
and
the
relief
disappeared
in
the
intense
brilliancy
of
the
disc
then
reappeared
to
the
eyes
of
the
travellers
that
original
aspect
of
the
lunar
landscapes
raw
in
tone
without
gradation
of
colours
only
white
and
black
for
diffused
light
was
wanting
still
the
sight
of
this
desolate
world
was
very
curious
on
account
of
its
very
strangeness
they
were
moving
above
this
chaotic
region
as
if
carried
along
by
the
breath
of
a
tempest
seeing
the
summits
fly
under
their
feet
looking
down
the
cavities
climbing
the
ramparts
sounding
the
mysterious
holes
but
there
was
no
trace
of
vegetation
no
appearance
of
cities
nothing
but
stratifications
lava
streams
polished
like
immense
mirrors
which
reflect
the
solar
rays
with
unbearable
brilliancy
there
was
no
appearance
of
a
living
world
everything
of
a
dead
one
where
the
avalanches
rolling
from
the
summit
of
the
mountains
rushed
noiselessly
they
had
plenty
of
movement
but
noise
was
wanting
still
barbicane
established
the
fact
by
reiterated
observation
that
the
reliefs
on
the
borders
of
the
disc
although
they
had
been
acted
upon
by
different
forces
to
those
of
the
central
region
presented
a
uniform
conformation
there
was
the
same
circular
aggregation
the
same
accidents
of
ground
still
it
might
be
supposed
that
their
arrangements
were
not
completely
analogous
in
the
centre
the
still
malleable
crust
of
the
moon
suffered
the
double
attraction
of
the
moon
and
the
earth
acting
in
inverse
ways
according
to
a
radius
prolonged
from
one
to
the
other
on
the
borders
of
the
disc
on
the
contrary
the
lunar
attraction
has
been
thus
to
say
perpendicular
with
the
terrestrial
attraction
it
seems
therefore
that
the
reliefs
on
the
soil
produced
under
these
conditions
ought
to
have
taken
a
different
form
yet
they
had
not
therefore
the
moon
had
found
in
herself
alone
the
principle
of
her
formation
and
constitution
she
owed
nothing
to
foreign
influences
which
justified
the
remarkable
proposition
of
arago
no
action
exterior
to
the
moon
has
contributed
to
the
production
of
her
relief
however
that
may
be
in
its
actual
condition
this
world
was
the
image
of
death
without
it
being
possible
to
say
that
life
had
ever
animated
it
michel
ardan
however
thought
he
recognised
a
heap
of
ruins
to
which
he
drew
barbicane
attention
it
was
situated
in
about
the
parallel
and
longitude
this
heap
of
stones
pretty
regularly
made
was
in
the
shape
of
a
vast
fortress
overlooking
one
of
those
long
furrows
which
served
as
in
times
not
far
off
rose
to
a
height
of
metres
the
circular
mountain
called
short
equal
to
the
asiatic
caucasus
michel
ardan
with
his
habitual
ardour
maintained
the
evidences
of
his
fortress
below
he
perceived
the
dismantled
ramparts
of
a
town
here
the
arch
of
a
portico
still
intact
there
two
or
three
columns
lying
on
their
side
farther
on
a
succession
of
archpieces
which
must
have
supported
the
conduct
of
an
aqueduct
in
another
part
the
sunken
pillars
of
a
gigantic
bridge
run
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
furrow
he
distinguished
all
that
but
with
so
much
imagination
in
his
eyes
through
a
telescope
so
fanciful
that
his
observation
can
not
be
relied
upon
and
yet
who
would
affirm
who
would
dare
to
say
that
the
amiable
fellow
had
not
really
seen
what
his
two
companions
would
not
see
the
moments
were
too
precious
to
be
sacrificed
to
an
idle
discussion
the
selenite
city
whether
real
or
pretended
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
the
projectile
began
to
get
farther
away
from
the
lunar
disc
and
the
details
of
the
ground
began
to
be
lost
in
a
confused
jumble
the
reliefs
amphitheatres
craters
and
plains
alone
remained
and
still
showed
their
distinctly
at
that
moment
there
stretched
to
the
left
one
of
the
finest
amphitheatres
in
lunar
orography
it
was
newton
which
barbicane
easily
recognised
by
referring
to
the
newton
is
situated
in
exactly
south
lat
and
east
long
it
forms
a
circular
crater
the
ramparts
of
which
metres
high
seemed
to
be
inaccessible
barbicane
made
his
companions
notice
that
the
height
of
that
mountain
above
the
surrounding
plain
was
far
from
being
equal
to
the
depth
of
its
crater
this
enormous
hole
was
beyond
all
measurement
and
made
a
gloomy
abyss
the
bottom
of
which
the
sun
rays
could
never
reach
there
according
to
humboldt
utter
darkness
reigns
which
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
could
not
break
the
mythologists
would
have
made
it
with
justice
hell
mouth
newton
said
barbicane
is
the
most
perfect
type
of
the
circular
mountains
of
which
the
earth
possesses
no
specimen
they
prove
that
the
formation
of
the
moon
by
cooling
was
due
to
violent
causes
for
whilst
under
the
influence
of
interior
fire
the
reliefs
were
thrown
up
to
considerable
heights
the
bottom
dropped
in
and
became
lower
than
the
lunar
level
i
do
not

no
answered
michel
ardan
a
few
minutes
after
having
passed

the
projectile
stood
directly
over
the

rather
high
above

its
height
is
estimated
at
metres
the
travellers
at
a
distance
of
miles
reduced
to
two
by
the
telescopes
could
admire
the
arrangement
of
this
vast
crater
the
terrestrial
volcanoes
said
barbicane
are
only
molehills
compared
to
the
volcanoes
of
the
moon
measuring
the
ancient
craters
formed
by
the
first
eruptions
of
vesuvius
and
etna
they
are
found
to
be
scarcely
metres
wide
in
france
the
circle
of
the
cantal
measures
five
miles
at
ceylon
the
circle
of
the
island
is
forty
miles
and
is
considered
the
largest
on
the
globe
what
are
these
diameters
compared
to
that
of
clavius
which
we
are
over
in
this
moment
what
is
its
width
asked
nicholl
about
seventy
miles
answered
barbicane
this
amphitheatre
is
certainly
the
largest
on
the
moon
but
many
are
fifty
miles
wide
ah
my
friends
exclaimed
michel
ardan
can
you
imagine
what
this
peaceful
orb
of
night
was
once
like
when
these
craters
vomited
torrents
of
lava
and
stones
with
clouds
of
smoke
and
sheets
of
flame
what
a
prodigious
spectacle
formerly
and
now
what
a
falling
off
this
moon
is
now
only
the
meagre
case
of
fireworks
of
which
the
rockets
serpents
suns
and
wheels
after
going
off
magnificently
only
leave
torn
pieces
of
cardboard
who
can
tell
the
cause
reason
or
justification
of
such
cataclysms
barbicane
did
not
listen
to
michel
ardan
he
was
contemplating
those
ramparts
of
clavius
formed
of
wide
mountains
several
leagues
thick
at
the
bottom
of
its
immense
cavity
lay
hundreds
of
small
extinct
craters
making
the
soil
like
a
sieve
and
overlooked
by
a
peak
more
than
feet
high
the
plain
around
had
a
desolate
aspect
nothing
so
arid
as
these
reliefs
nothing
so
sad
as
these
ruins
of
mountains
if
so
they
may
be
called
as
those
heaps
of
peaks
and
mountains
encumbering
the
ground
the
satellite
seemed
to
have
been
blown
up
in
this
place
the
projectile
still
went
on
and
the
chaos
was
still
the
same
circles
craters
and
mountains
succeeded
each
other
incessantly
no
more
plains
or
seas
an
interminable
switzerland
or
norway
lastly
in
the
centre
of
the
creviced
region
at
its
culminating
point
the
most
splendid
mountain
of
the
lunar
disc
the
dazzling
tycho
to
which
posterity
still
gives
the
name
of
the
illustrious
danish
astronomer
whilst
observing
the
full
moon
in
a
cloudless
sky
there
is
no
one
who
has
not
remarked
this
brilliant
point
on
the
southern
hemisphere
michel
ardan
to
qualify
it
employed
all
the
metaphors
his
imagination
could
furnish
him
with
to
him
tycho
was
an
ardent
focus
of
light
a
centre
of
irradiation
a
crater
vomiting
flames
it
was
the
axle
of
a
fiery
wheel
a
encircling
the
disc
with
its
silver
tentacles
an
immense
eye
darting
fire
a
nimbo
made
for
pluto
head
it
was
a
star
hurled
by
the
hand
of
the
creator
and
fallen
upon
the
lunar
surface
tycho
forms
such
a
luminous
concentration
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
can
see
it
without
a
telescope
although
they
are
at
a
distance
of
leagues
it
will
therefore
be
readily
imagined
what
its
intensity
must
have
been
in
the
eyes
of
observers
placed
at
fifty
leagues
only
across
this
pure
ether
its
brilliancy
was
so
unbearable
that
barbicane
and
his
friends
were
obliged
to
blacken
the
of
their
telescopes
with
in
order
to
support
it
then
mute
hardly
emitting
a
few
admirative
interjections
they
looked
and
contemplated
all
their
sentiments
all
their
impressions
were
concentrated
in
their
eyes
as
life
under
violent
emotion
is
concentrated
in
the
heart
tycho
belongs
to
the
system
of
radiating
mountains
like
aristarchus
and
copernicus
but
it
testified
the
most
completely
of
all
to
the
terrible
volcanic
action
to
which
the
formation
of
the
moon
is
due
tycho
is
situated
in
south
lat
and
east
long
its
centre
is
occupied
by
a
crater
more
than
forty
miles
wide
it
affects
a
slightly
elliptical
form
and
is
inclosed
by
circular
ramparts
which
on
the
east
and
west
overlook
the
exterior
plain
from
a
height
of
metres
it
is
an
aggregation
of
mont
blancs
placed
round
a
common
centre
and
crowned
with
shining
rays
photography
itself
could
never
represent
what
this
incomparable
mountain
with
all
its
projections
converging
to
it
and
its
interior
excrescences
is
really
like
in
fact
it
is
during
the
full
moon
that
tycho
is
seen
in
all
its
splendour
then
all
shadows
disappear
the
foreshortenings
of
perspective
disappear
and
all
proofs
come
out
white
an
unfortunate
circumstance
for
this
strange
region
would
have
been
curious
to
reproduce
with
photographic
exactitude
it
is
only
an
agglomeration
of
holes
craters
circles
a
vertiginous
network
of
crests
it
will
be
understood
therefore
that
the
bubblings
of
this
central
eruption
have
kept
their
first
forms
crystallised
by
cooling
they
have
stereotyped
the
aspect
which
the
moon
formerly
presented
under
the
influence
of
plutonic
forces
the
distance
which
separated
the
travellers
from
the
circular
summits
of
tycho
was
not
so
great
that
the
travellers
could
not
survey
its
principal
details
even
upon
the
embankment
which
forms
the
ramparts
of
tycho
the
mountains
hanging
to
the
interior
and
exterior
slopes
rose
in
stories
like
gigantic
terraces
they
appeared
to
be
higher
by
or
feet
on
the
west
than
on
the
east
no
system
of
terrestrial
castrametation
could
equal
these
natural
fortifications
a
town
built
at
the
bottom
of
this
circular
cavity
would
have
been
utterly
inaccessible
inaccessible
and
marvellously
extended
over
this
ground
of
picturesque
relief
nature
had
not
left
the
bottom
of
this
crater
flat
and
empty
it
possessed
a
special
orography
a
mountain
system
which
made
it
a
world
apart
the
travellers
clearly
distinguished
the

central

remarkable

of
the

disposed
for
the

of

there
was

there
the

the

exclaimed
michel
ardan
made
enthusiastic
by
the
sight
what
grand
towns
could
be
built
in
this
circle
of
mountains
a
tranquil
city
a
peaceful
refuge
away
from
all
human
cares
how
all
misanthropes
could
live
there
all
haters
of

all
those
disgusted
with

all
it
would
be
too
small
for
them
replied
barbicane
simply
chapter
xviii
grave
questions
in
the
meantime
the
projectile
had
passed
the
neighbourhood
of
tycho
barbicane
and
his
two
friends
then
observed
with
the
most
scrupulous
attention
those
brilliant
radii
which
the
celebrated
mountain
disperses
so
curiously
on
every
horizon
what
was
this
radiating
aureole
what
geological
phenomenon
had
caused
those
ardent
beams
this
question
justly
occupied
barbicane
under
his
eyes
in
every
direction
ran
luminous
furrows
with
raised
banks
and
concave
middle
some
ten
miles
others
more
than
twenty
miles
wide
these
shining
trails
ran
in
certain
places
at
least
leagues
from
tycho
and
seemed
to
cover
especially
towards
the
east
and
north
half
the
southern
hemisphere
one
of
these
furrows
stretched
as
far
as
the
amphitheatre
of
neander
situated
on
the
meridian
another
went
rounding
off
through
the
sea
of
nectar
and
broke
against
the
chain
of
the
pyrenees
after
a
run
of
leagues
others
towards
the
west
covered
with
a
luminous
network
the
sea
of
clouds
and
the
sea
of
humours
what
was
the
origin
of
these
shining
rays
running
equally
over
plains
and
reliefs
however
high
they
all
started
from
a
common
centre
the
crater
of
tycho
they
emanated
from
it
herschel
attributed
their
brilliant
aspect
to
ancient
streams
of
lava
congealed
by
the
cold
an
opinion
which
has
not
been
generally
received
other
astronomers
have
seen
in
these
inexplicable
rays
a
kind
of
ranges
of
erratic
blocks
thrown
out
at
the
epoch
of
the
formation
of
tycho
and
why
should
it
not
be
so
asked
nicholl
of
barbicane
who
rejected
these
different
opinions
at
the
same
time
that
he
related
them
because
the
regularity
of
these
luminous
lines
and
the
violence
necessary
to
send
them
to
such
a
distance
are
inexplicable
replied
michel
ardan
i
can
easily
explain
to
myself
the
origin
of
these
rays
indeed
said
barbicane
yes
resumed
michel
why
should
they
not
be
the
cracks
caused
by
the
shock
of
a
bullet
or
a
stone
upon
a
pane
of
glass
good
replied
barbicane
smiling
and
what
hand
would
be
powerful
enough
to
hurl
the
stone
that
would
produce
such
a
shock
a
hand
is
not
necessary
answered
michel
who
would
not
give
in
and
as
to
the
stone
let
us
say
it
is
a
comet
ah
comets
exclaimed
barbicane
those
comets
my
worthy
michel
your
explanation
is
not
bad
but
your
comet
is
not
wanted
the
shock
might
have
come
from
the
interior
of
the
planet
a
violent
contraction
of
the
lunar
crust
whilst
cooling
was
enough
to
make
that
gigantic
crack
contraction
let
it
be
something
like
a
lunar
colic
answered
michel
ardan
besides
added
barbicane
that
is
also
the
opinion
of
an
english
nasmyth
and
it
seems
to
me
to
explain
the
radiation
of
these
mountains
sufficiently
that
nasmyth
was
no
fool
answered
michel
the
travellers
who
could
never
weary
of
such
a
spectacle
long
admired
the
splendours
of
tycho
their
projectile
bathed
in
that
double
irradiation
of
the
sun
and
moon
must
have
appeared
like
a
globe
of
fire
they
had
therefore
suddenly
passed
from
considerable
cold
to
intense
heat
nature
was
thus
preparing
them
to
become
selenites
to
become
selenites
that
idea
again
brought
up
the
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
after
what
they
had
seen
could
the
travellers
solve
it
could
they
conclude
for
or
against
michel
ardan
asked
his
two
friends
to
give
utterance
to
their
opinion
and
asked
them
outright
if
they
thought
that
humanity
and
animality
were
represented
in
the
lunar
world
i
think
we
can
not
answer
said
barbicane
but
in
my
opinion
the
question
ought
not
to
be
stated
in
that
form
i
ask
to
be
allowed
to
state
it
differently
state
it
as
you
like
answered
michel
this
is
it
resumed
barbicane
the
problem
is
double
and
requires
a
double
solution
is
the
moon
habitable
has
it
been
inhabited
right
said
nicholl
let
us
first
see
if
the
moon
is
habitable
to
tell
the
truth
i
know
nothing
about
it
replied
michel
and
i
answer
in
the
negative
said
barbicane
in
her
actual
state
with
her
certainly
very
slight
atmosphere
her
seas
mostly
dried
up
her
insufficient
water
her
restricted
vegetation
her
abrupt
alternations
of
heat
and
cold
her
nights
and
days
hours
long
the
moon
does
not
appear
habitable
to
me
nor
propitious
to
the
development
of
the
animal
kingdom
nor
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
existence
such
as
we
understand
it
agreed
answered
nicholl
but
is
not
the
moon
habitable
for
beings
differently
organised
to
us
that
question
is
more
difficult
to
answer
replied
barbicane
i
will
try
to
do
it
however
but
i
ask
nicholl
if
movement
seems
to
him
the
necessary
result
of
existence
under
no
matter
what
organisation
without
the
slightest
doubt
answered
nicholl
well
then
my
worthy
companion
my
answer
will
be
that
we
have
seen
the
lunar
continent
at
a
distance
of
yards
and
that
nothing
appeared
to
be
moving
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
the
presence
of
no
matter
what
form
of
humanity
would
be
betrayed
by
appropriations
different
constructions
or
even
ruins
what
did
we
see
everywhere
the
geological
work
of
nature
never
the
work
of
man
if
therefore
representatives
of
the
animal
kingdom
exist
upon
the
moon
they
have
taken
refuge
in
those
bottomless
cavities
which
the
eye
can
not
reach
and
i
can
not
admit
that
either
for
they
would
have
left
traces
of
their
passage
upon
the
plains
which
the
atmosphere
however
slight
covers
now
these
traces
are
nowhere
visible
therefore
the
only
hypothesis
that
remains
is
one
of
living
beings
without
movement
or
life
you
might
just
as
well
say
living
creatures
who
are
not
alive
precisely
answered
barbicane
which
for
us
has
no
meaning
then
now
we
may
formulate
our
opinion
said
michel
yes
answered
nicholl
very
well
resumed
michel
ardan
the
scientific
commission
meeting
in
the
projectile
of
the
gun
club
after
having
supported
its
arguments
upon
fresh
facts
lately
observed
decides
unanimously
upon
the
question
of
the
habitability
of
the
moon
the
moon
is
not
inhabited
this
decision
was
taken
down
by
barbicane
in
his
notebook
where
he
had
already
written
the
of
the
sitting
of
december
now
said
nicholl
let
us
attack
the
second
question
depending
on
the
first
i
therefore
ask
the
honourable
commission
if
the
moon
is
not
habitable
has
it
been
inhabited
answer
citizen
barbicane
said
michel
ardan
my
friends
answered
barbicane
i
did
not
undertake
this
journey
to
form
an
opinion
upon
the
ancient
habitability
of
our
satellite
i
may
add
that
my
personal
observations
only
confirm
me
in
this
opinion
i
believe
i
even
affirm
that
the
moon
has
been
inhabited
by
a
human
race
organised
like
ours
that
it
has
produced
animals
anatomically
formed
like
terrestrial
animals
but
i
add
that
these
races
human
or
animal
have
had
their
day
and
are
for
ever
extinct
then
asked
michel
the
moon
is
an
older
world
than
the
earth
no
answered
barbicane
with
conviction
but
a
world
that
has
grown
old
more
quickly
whose
formation
and
deformation
have
been
more
rapid
relatively
the
organising
forces
of
matter
have
been
much
more
violent
in
the
interior
of
the
moon
than
in
the
interior
of
the
celestial
globe
the
actual
state
of
this
disc
broken
up
tormented
and
swollen
proves
this
abundantly
in
their
origin
the
moon
and
the
earth
were
only
gases
these
gases
became
liquids
under
different
influences
and
the
solid
mass
was
formed
afterwards
but
it
is
certain
that
our
globe
was
gas
or
liquid
still
when
the
moon
already
solidified
by
cooling
became
habitable
i
believe
that
said
nicholl
then
resumed
barbicane
it
was
surrounded
by
atmosphere
the
water
held
in
by
the
gassy
element
could
not
evaporate
under
the
influence
of
air
water
light
and
heat
solar
and
central
vegetation
took
possession
of
these
continents
prepared
for
its
reception
and
certainly
life
manifested
itself
about
that
epoch
for
nature
does
not
spend
itself
in
inutilities
and
a
world
so
marvellously
habitable
must
have
been
inhabited
still
answered
nicholl
many
phenomena
inherent
to
the
movements
of
our
satellite
must
have
prevented
the
expansion
of
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
the
days
and
nights
hours
long
for
example
at
the
terrestrial
poles
said
michel
they
last
six
months
that
is
not
a
valuable
argument
as
the
poles
are
not
inhabited
in
the
actual
state
of
the
moon
resumed
barbicane
the
long
nights
and
days
create
differences
of
temperature
insupportable
to
the
constitution
but
it
was
not
so
at
that
epoch
of
historical
times
the
atmosphere
enveloped
the
disc
with
a
fluid
mantle
vapour
deposited
itself
in
the
form
of
clouds
this
natural
screen
tempered
the
ardour
of
the
solar
lays
and
retained
the
nocturnal
radiation
both
light
and
heat
could
diffuse
themselves
in
the
air
hence
there
was
equilibrium
between
the
influences
which
no
longer
exists
now
that
the
atmosphere
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
besides
i
shall
astonish
you
astonish
us
said
michel
ardan
but
i
believe
that
at
the
epoch
when
the
moon
was
inhabited
the
nights
and
days
did
not
last
hours
why
so
asked
nicholl
quickly
because
it
is
very
probable
that
then
the
moon
movement
of
rotation
on
her
axis
was
not
equal
to
her
movement
of
revolution
an
equality
which
puts
every
point
of
the
lunar
disc
under
the
action
of
the
solar
rays
for
fifteen
days
agreed
answered
nicholl
but
why
should
not
these
movements
have
been
equal
since
they
are
so
actually
because
that
equality
has
only
been
determined
by
terrestrial
attraction
now
how
do
we
know
that
this
attraction
was
powerful
enough
to
influence
the
movements
of
the
moon
at
the
epoch
the
earth
was
still
fluid
true
replied
nicholl
and
who
can
say
that
the
moon
has
always
been
the
earth
satellite
and
who
can
say
exclaimed
michel
ardan
that
the
moon
did
not
exist
before
the
earth
imagination
began
to
wander
in
the
indefinite
field
of
hypotheses
barbicane
wished
to
hold
them
in
those
said
he
are
speculations
too
high
problems
really
insoluble
do
not
let
us
enter
into
them
let
us
only
admit
the
insufficiency
of
primordial
attraction
and
then
by
the
inequality
of
rotation
and
revolution
days
and
nights
could
succeed
each
other
upon
the
moon
as
they
do
upon
the
earth
besides
even
under
those
conditions
life
was
possible
then
asked
michel
ardan
humanity
has
quite
disappeared
from
the
moon
yes
answered
barbicane
after
having
doubtless
existed
for
thousands
of
centuries
then
gradually
the
atmosphere
becoming
rarefied
the
disc
will
again
be
uninhabitable
like
the
terrestrial
globe
will
one
day
become
by
cooling
by
cooling
certainly
answered
barbicane
as
the
interior
fires
became
extinguished
the
incandescent
matter
was
concentrated
and
the
lunar
disc
became
cool
by
degrees
the
consequences
of
this
phenomenon
came
about
the
disappearance
of
organic
beings
and
the
disappearance
of
vegetation
soon
the
atmosphere
became
rarefied
and
was
probably
drawn
away
by
terrestrial
attraction
the
breathable
air
disappeared
and
so
did
water
by
evaporation
at
that
epoch
the
moon
became
uninhabitable
and
was
no
longer
inhabited
it
was
a
dead
world
like
it
is
and
you
say
that
the
like
fate
is
reserved
for
the
earth
very
probably
but
when
when
the
cooling
of
its
crust
will
have
made
it
uninhabitable
has
the
time
it
will
take
our
unfortunate
globe
to
melt
been
calculated
certainly
and
you
know
the
reason
perfectly
then
tell
us
sulky
you
make
me
boil
with
impatience
well
my
worthy
michel
answered
barbicane
tranquilly
it
is
well
known
what
diminution
of
temperature
the
earth
suffers
in
the
lapse
of
a
century
now
according
to
certain
calculations
that
average
temperature
will
be
brought
down
to
zero
after
a
period
of
years
four
hundred
thousand
years
exclaimed
michel
ah
i
breathe
again
i
was
really
frightened
i
imagined
from
listening
to
you
that
we
had
only
fifty
thousand
years
to
live
barbicane
and
nicholl
could
not
help
laughing
at
their
uneasiness
then
nicholl
who
wanted
to
have
done
with
it
reminded
them
of
the
second
question
to
be
settled
has
the
moon
been
inhabited
he
asked
the
answer
was
unanimously
in
the
affirmative
during
this
discussion
fruitful
in
somewhat
hazardous
theories
although
it
resumed
the
general
ideas
of
science
on
the
subject
the
projectile
had
run
rapidly
towards
the
lunar
equator
at
the
same
time
that
it
went
farther
away
from
the
lunar
disc
it
had
passed
the
circle
of
willem
and
the
parallel
at
a
distance
of
miles
then
leaving
pitatus
to
the
right
on
the
degree
it
went
along
the
south
of
the
sea
of
clouds
of
which
it
had
already
approached
the
north
different
amphitheatres
appeared
confusedly
under
the
white
light
of
the
full
moon
bouillaud
purbach
almost
square
with
a
central
crater
then
arzachel
whose
interior
mountain
shone
with
indefinable
brilliancy
at
last
as
the
projectile
went
farther
and
farther
away
the
details
faded
from
the
travellers
eyes
the
mountains
were
confounded
in
the
distance
and
all
that
remained
of
the
marvellous
fantastical
and
wonderful
satellite
of
the
earth
was
the
imperishable
remembrance
chapter
xix
a
struggle
with
the
impossible
for
some
time
barbicane
and
his
companions
mute
and
pensive
looked
at
this
world
which
they
had
only
seen
from
a
distance
like
moses
saw
canaan
and
from
which
they
were
going
away
for
ever
the
position
of
the
projectile
relatively
to
the
moon
was
modified
and
now
its
lower
end
was
turned
towards
the
earth
this
change
verified
by
barbicane
surprised
him
greatly
if
the
bullet
was
going
to
gravitate
round
the
satellite
in
an
elliptical
orbit
why
was
not
its
heaviest
part
turned
towards
it
like
the
moon
to
the
earth
there
again
was
an
obscure
point
by
watching
the
progress
of
the
projectile
they
could
see
that
it
was
following
away
from
the
moon
an
analogous
curve
to
that
by
which
it
approached
her
it
was
therefore
describing
a
very
long
ellipsis
which
would
probably
extend
to
the
point
of
equal
attraction
where
the
influences
of
the
earth
and
her
satellite
are
neutralised
such
was
the
conclusion
which
barbicane
correctly
drew
from
the
facts
observed
a
conviction
which
his
two
friends
shared
with
him
questions
immediately
began
to
shower
upon
him
what
will
become
of
us
after
we
have
reached
the
neutral
point
asked
michel
ardan
that
is
unknown
answered
barbicane
but
we
can
make
suppositions
i
suppose
we
can
make
two
answered
barbicane
either
the
velocity
of
the
projectile
will
then
be
insufficient
and
it
will
remain
entirely
motionless
on
that
line
of
double
attraction
i
would
rather
have
the
other
supposition
whatever
it
is
replied
michel
or
the
velocity
will
be
sufficient
resumed
barbicane
and
it
will
continue
its
elliptical
orbit
and
gravitate
eternally
round
the
orb
of
night
not
very
consoling
that
revolution
said
michel
to
become
the
humble
servants
of
a
moon
whom
we
are
in
the
habit
of
considering
our
servant
and
is
that
the
future
that
awaits
us
neither
barbicane
nor
nicholl
answered
why
do
you
not
answer
asked
the
impatient
michel
there
is
nothing
to
answer
said
nicholl
can
nothing
be
done
no
answered
barbicane
do
you
pretend
to
struggle
with
the
impossible
why
not
ought
a
frenchman
and
two
americans
to
recoil
at
such
a
word
but
what
do
you
want
to
do
command
the
motion
that
is
carrying
us
along
command
it
yes
resumed
michel
getting
animated
stop
it
or
modify
it
use
it
for
the
accomplishment
of
our
plans
and
how
pray
that
is
your
business
if
artillerymen
are
not
masters
of
their
bullets
they
are
no
longer
artillerymen
if
the
projectile
commands
the
gunner
the
gunner
ought
to
be
rammed
instead
into
the
cannon
fine
truly
who
do
know
now
what
to
do
after
having
induced
me
induced
cried
barbicane
and
nicholl
induced
what
do
you
mean
by
that
no
recriminations
said
michel
i
do
not
complain
the
journey
pleases
me
the
bullet
suits
me
but
let
us
do
all
that
is
humanly
possible
to
fall
somewhere
if
only
upon
the
moon
we
should
only
be
too
glad
my
worthy
michel
answered
barbicane
but
we
have
no
means
of
doing
it
can
we
not
modify
the
motion
of
the
projectile
no
nor
diminish
its
speed
no
not
even
by
lightening
it
like
they
lighten
an
overloaded
ship
what
can
we
throw
out
answered
nicholl
we
have
no
ballast
on
board
and
besides
it
seems
to
me
that
a
lightened
projectile
would
go
on
more
quickly
less
quickly
said
michel
more
quickly
replied
nicholl
neither
more
nor
less
quickly
answered
barbicane
wishing
to
make
his
two
friends
agree
for
we
are
moving
in
the
void
where
we
can
not
take
specific
weight
into
account
very
well
exclaimed
michel
ardan
in
a
determined
tone
there
is
only
one
thing
to
do
what
is
that
asked
nicholl
have
breakfast
imperturbably
answered
the
audacious
frenchman
who
always
brought
that
solution
to
the
greatest
difficulties
in
fact
though
that
operation
would
have
no
influence
on
the
direction
of
the
projectile
it
might
be
attempted
without
risk
and
even
successfully
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
stomach
decidedly
the
amiable
michel
had
only
good
ideas
they
breakfasted
therefore
at
but
the
hour
was
not
of
much
consequence
michel
served
up
his
habitual
crowned
by
an
amiable
bottle
out
of
his
secret
cellar
if
ideas
did
not
come
into
their
heads
the
chambertin
of
must
be
despaired
of
the
meal
over
observations
began
again
the
objects
they
had
thrown
out
of
the
projectile
still
followed
it
at
the
same
invariable
distance
it
was
evident
that
the
bullet
in
its
movement
of
translation
round
the
moon
had
not
passed
through
any
atmosphere
for
the
specific
weight
of
these
objects
would
have
modified
their
respective
distances
there
was
nothing
to
see
on
the
side
of
the
terrestrial
globe
the
earth
was
only
a
day
old
having
been
new
at
midnight
the
day
before
and
two
days
having
to
go
by
before
her
crescent
disengaged
from
the
solar
rays
could
serve
as
a
clock
to
the
selenites
as
in
her
movement
of
rotation
each
of
her
points
always
passes
the
same
meridian
of
the
moon
every
hours
the
spectacle
was
a
different
one
on
the
side
of
the
moon
the
orb
was
shining
in
all
its
splendour
amidst
innumerable
constellations
the
rays
of
which
could
not
trouble
its
purity
upon
the
disc
the
plains
again
wore
the
sombre
tint
which
is
seen
from
the
earth
the
rest
of
the
nimbus
was
shining
and
amidst
the
general
blaze
tycho
stood
out
like
a
sun
barbicane
could
not
manage
any
way
to
appreciate
the
velocity
of
the
projectile
but
reasoning
demonstrated
that
this
speed
must
be
uniformly
diminishing
in
conformity
with
the
laws
of
rational
mechanics
in
fact
it
being
admitted
that
the
bullet
would
describe
an
orbit
round
the
moon
that
orbit
must
necessarily
be
elliptical
science
proves
that
it
must
be
thus
no
mobile
circulation
round
any
body
is
an
exception
to
that
law
all
the
orbits
described
in
space
are
elliptical
those
of
satellites
round
their
planets
those
of
planets
around
their
sun
that
of
the
sun
round
the
unknown
orb
that
serves
as
its
central
pivot
why
should
the
projectile
of
the
gun
club
escape
that
natural
arrangement
now
in
elliptical
orbits
attracting
bodies
always
occupy
one
of
the
foci
of
the
ellipsis
the
satellite
is
therefore
nearer
the
body
round
which
it
gravitates
at
one
moment
than
it
is
at
another
when
the
earth
is
nearest
the
sun
she
is
at
her
perihelion
and
at
her
aphelion
when
most
distant
the
moon
is
nearest
the
earth
at
her
perigee
and
most
distant
at
her
apogee
to
employ
analogous
expressions
which
enrich
the
language
of
astronomers
if
the
projectile
remained
a
satellite
of
the
moon
it
ought
to
be
said
that
it
is
in
its
aposelene
at
its
most
distant
point
and
at
its
periselene
at
its
nearest
in
the
latter
case
the
projectile
ought
to
attain
its
maximum
of
speed
in
the
latter
its
minimum
now
it
was
evidently
going
towards
its
aposelene
and
barbicane
was
right
in
thinking
its
speed
would
decrease
up
to
that
point
and
gradually
increase
when
it
would
again
draw
near
the
moon
that
speed
even
would
be
absolutely
if
the
point
was
coexistent
with
that
of
attraction
barbicane
studied
the
consequences
of
these
different
situations
he
was
trying
what
he
could
make
of
them
when
he
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
cry
from
michel
ardan
cried
michel
what
fools
we
are
i
do
say
we
are
not
answered
barbicane
but
why
because
we
have
some
very
simple
means
of
slackening
the
speed
that
is
taking
us
away
from
the
moon
and
we
do
not
use
them
and
what
are
those
means
that
of
utilising
the
force
of
recoil
in
our
rockets
ah
why
not
said
nicholl
we
have
not
yet
utilised
that
force
it
is
true
said
barbicane
but
we
shall
do
so
when
asked
michel
when
the
time
comes
remark
my
friends
that
in
the
position
now
occupied
by
the
projectile
a
position
still
oblique
to
the
lunar
disc
our
rockets
by
altering
its
direction
might
take
it
farther
away
instead
of
nearer
to
the
moon
now
i
suppose
it
is
the
moon
you
want
to
reach
essentially
answered
michel
wait
then
through
some
inexplicable
influence
the
projectile
has
a
tendency
to
let
its
lower
end
fall
towards
the
earth
it
is
probable
that
at
the
point
of
equal
attraction
its
conical
summit
will
be
rigorously
directed
towards
the
moon
at
that
moment
it
may
be
hoped
that
its
speed
will
be
that
will
be
the
time
to
act
and
under
the
effort
of
our
rockets
we
can
perhaps
provoke
a
direct
fall
upon
the
surface
of
the
lunar
disc
bravo
said
michel
we
have
not
done
it
yet
and
we
could
not
do
it
as
we
passed
the
neutral
point
because
the
projectile
was
still
animated
with
too
much
velocity
well
reasoned
out
said
nicholl
we
must
wait
patiently
said
barbicane
and
put
every
chance
on
our
side
then
after
having
despaired
so
long
i
again
begin
to
think
we
shall
reach
our
goal
this
conclusion
provoked
hurrahs
from
michel
ardan
no
one
of
these
daring
madmen
remembered
the
question
they
had
all
answered
in
the
negative
no
the
moon
is
not
inhabited
no
the
moon
is
probably
not
inhabitable
and
yet
they
were
going
to
do
all
they
could
to
reach
it
one
question
only
now
remained
to
be
solved
at
what
precise
moment
would
the
projectile
reach
that
point
of
equal
attraction
where
the
travellers
would
play
their
last
card
in
order
to
calculate
that
moment
to
within
some
seconds
barbicane
had
only
to
have
recourse
to
his
travelling
notes
and
to
take
the
different
altitudes
from
lunar
parallels
thus
the
time
employed
in
going
over
the
distance
between
the
neutral
point
and
the
south
pole
must
be
equal
to
the
distance
which
separates
the
south
pole
from
the
neutral
point
the
hours
representing
the
time
it
took
were
carefully
noted
down
and
the
calculation
became
easy
barbicane
found
that
this
point
would
be
reached
by
the
projectile
at
on
the
of
december
it
was
then
on
the
of
december
therefore
if
nothing
intervened
the
projectile
would
reach
the
neutral
point
in
hours
the
rockets
had
been
put
in
their
places
to
slacken
the
fall
of
the
bullet
upon
the
moon
and
now
the
bold
fellows
were
going
to
use
them
to
provoke
an
exactly
contrary
effect
however
that
may
be
they
were
ready
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
await
the
moment
for
setting
fire
to
them
as
there
is
nothing
to
do
said
nicholl
i
have
a
proposition
to
make
what
is
that
asked
barbicane
i
propose
we
go
to
sleep
that
is
a
nice
idea
exclaimed
michel
ardan
it
is
forty
hours
since
we
have
closed
our
eyes
said
nicholl
a
few
hours
sleep
would
set
us
up
again
never
replied
michel
good
said
nicholl
every
man
to
his
humour
mine
is
to
sleep
and
lying
down
on
a
divan
nicholl
was
soon
snoring
like
a
pound
bullet
nicholl
is
a
sensible
man
said
barbicane
soon
i
shall
imitate
him
a
few
minutes
after
he
was
joining
his
bass
to
the
captain
baritone
decidedly
said
michel
ardan
when
he
found
himself
alone
these
practical
people
sometimes
do
have
opportune
ideas
and
stretching
out
his
long
legs
and
folding
his
long
arms
under
his
head
michel
went
to
sleep
too
but
this
slumber
could
neither
be
durable
nor
peaceful
too
many
preoccupations
filled
the
minds
of
these
three
men
and
a
few
hours
after
at
about
they
all
three
awoke
at
once
the
projectile
was
still
moving
away
from
the
moon
inclining
its
conical
summit
more
and
more
towards
her
this
phenomenon
was
inexplicable
at
present
but
it
fortunately
aided
the
designs
of
barbicane
another
seventeen
hours
and
the
time
for
action
would
have
come
that
day
seemed
long
however
bold
they
might
be
the
travellers
felt
much
anxiety
at
the
approach
of
the
minute
that
was
to
decide
everything
either
their
fall
upon
the
moon
or
their
imprisonment
in
an
immutable
orbit
they
therefore
counted
the
hours
which
went
too
slowly
for
them
barbicane
and
nicholl
obstinately
plunged
in
calculations
michel
walking
up
and
down
the
narrow
space
between
the
walls
contemplating
with
longing
eye
the
impassible
moon
sometimes
thoughts
of
the
earth
passed
through
their
minds
they
saw
again
their
friends
of
the
gun
club
and
the
dearest
of
them
all
maston
at
that
moment
the
honourable
secretary
must
have
been
occupying
his
post
on
the
rocky
mountains
if
he
should
perceive
the
projectile
upon
the
mirror
of
his
gigantic
telescope
what
would
he
think
after
having
seen
it
disappear
behind
the
south
pole
of
the
moon
they
would
see
it
reappear
at
the
north
it
was
therefore
the
satellite
of
a
satellite
had
maston
sent
that
unexpected
announcement
into
the
world
was
this
to
be
the
of
the
great
enterprise
meanwhile
the
day
passed
without
incident
terrestrial
midnight
came
the
of
december
was
about
to
commence
another
hour
and
the
point
of
equal
attraction
would
be
reached
what
velocity
then
animated
the
projectile
they
could
form
no
estimate
but
no
error
could
vitiate
barbicane
calculations
at
that
velocity
ought
to
be
and
would
be
besides
another
phenomenon
would
mark
the
stopping
point
of
the
projectile
on
the
neutral
line
in
that
spot
the
two
attractions
terrestrial
and
lunar
would
be
annihilated
objects
would
not
weigh
anything
this
singular
fact
which
had
so
curiously
surprised
barbicane
and
his
companions
before
must
again
come
about
under
identical
circumstances
it
was
at
that
precise
moment
they
must
act
the
conical
summit
of
the
bullet
had
already
sensibly
turned
towards
the
lunar
disc
the
projectile
was
just
right
for
utilising
all
the
recoil
produced
by
setting
fire
to
the
apparatus
chance
was
therefore
in
the
travellers
favour
if
the
velocity
of
the
projectile
were
to
be
absolutely
annihilated
upon
the
neutral
point
a
given
motion
however
slight
towards
the
moon
would
determine
its
fall
five
minutes
to
one
said
nicholl
everything
is
ready
answered
michel
ardan
directing
his
match
towards
the
flame
of
the
gas
wait
said
barbicane
chronometer
in
hand
at
that
moment
weight
had
no
effect
the
travellers
felt
its
complete
disappearance
in
themselves
they
were
near
the
neutral
point
if
they
had
not
reached
it
one
said
barbicane
michel
ardan
put
his
match
to
a
contrivance
that
put
all
the
fuses
into
instantaneous
communication
no
detonation
was
heard
outside
where
air
was
wanting
but
through
the
barbicane
saw
the
prolonged
flame
which
was
immediately
extinguished
the
projectile
had
a
slight
shock
which
was
very
sensibly
felt
in
the
interior
the
three
friends
looked
listened
without
speaking
hardly
breathing
the
beating
of
their
hearts
might
have
been
heard
in
the
absolute
silence
are
we
falling
asked
michel
ardan
at
last
no
answered
nicholl
for
the
bottom
of
the
projectile
has
not
turned
towards
the
lunar
disc
at
that
moment
barbicane
left
his
window
and
turned
towards
his
two
companions
he
was
frightfully
pale
his
forehead
wrinkled
his
lips
contracted
we
are
falling
said
he
ah
cried
michel
ardan
upon
the
moon
upon
the
earth
answered
barbicane
the
devil
cried
michel
ardan
and
he
added
philosophically
when
we
entered
the
bullet
we
did
not
think
it
would
be
so
difficult
to
get
out
of
it
again
in
fact
the
frightful
fall
had
begun
the
velocity
kept
by
the
projectile
had
sent
it
beyond
the
neutral
point
the
explosion
of
the
fuses
had
not
stopped
it
that
velocity
which
had
carried
the
projectile
beyond
the
neutral
line
as
it
went
was
destined
to
do
the
same
upon
its
return
the
law
of
physics
condemned
it
in
its
elliptical
orbit
pass
by
every
point
it
had
already
it
was
a
terrible
fall
from
a
height
of
leagues
and
which
no
springs
could
deaden
according
to
the
laws
of
ballistics
the
projectile
would
strike
the
earth
with
a
velocity
equal
to
that
which
animated
it
as
it
left
the
columbiad
a
velocity
of
metres
in
the
last
second
and
in
order
to
give
some
figures
for
comparison
it
has
been
calculated
that
an
object
thrown
from
the
towers
of
notre
dame
the
altitude
of
which
is
only
feet
would
reach
the
pavement
with
a
velocity
of
leagues
an
hour
here
the
projectile
would
strike
the
earth
with
a
velocity
of
an
we
are
lost
men
said
nicholl
coldly
well
if
we
die
answered
barbicane
with
a
sort
of
religious
enthusiasm
the
result
of
our
journey
will
be
magnificently
enlarged
god
will
tell
us
his
own
secret
in
the
other
life
the
soul
will
need
neither
machines
nor
engines
in
order
to
know
it
will
be
identified
with
eternal
wisdom
true
replied
michel
ardan
the
other
world
may
well
console
us
for
that
trifling
orb
called
the
moon
barbicane
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
chest
with
a
movement
of
sublime
resignation
god
will
be
done
he
said
chapter
xx
the
soundings
of
the
susquehanna
well
lieutenant
and
what
about
those
soundings
i
think
the
operation
is
almost
over
sir
but
who
would
have
expected
to
find
such
a
depth
so
near
land
at
leagues
only
from
the
american
coast
yes
bronsfield
there
is
a
great
depression
said
captain
blomsberry
there
exists
a
submarine
valley
here
hollowed
out
by
current
which
runs
along
the
coasts
of
america
to
the
straits
of
magellan
those
great
depths
said
the
lieutenant
are
not
favourable
for
the
laying
of
telegraph
cables
a
smooth
plateau
is
the
best
like
the
one
the
american
cable
lies
on
between
valentia
and
newfoundland
i
agree
with
you
bronsfield
and
may
it
please
you
lieutenant
where
are
we
now
sir
answered
bronsfield
we
have
at
this
moment
feet
of
line
out
and
the
bullet
at
the
end
of
the
line
has
not
yet
touched
the
bottom
for
the
would
have
come
up
again
brook
apparatus
is
an
ingenious
one
said
captain
blomsberry
it
allows
us
to
obtain
very
correct
soundings
touched
cried
at
that
moment
one
of
the
who
was
superintending
the
operation
the
captain
and
lieutenant
went
on
to
the
what
depth
are
we
in
asked
the
captain
thousand
seven
hundred
and
feet
answered
the
lieutenant
writing
it
down
in
his
very
well
bronsfield
said
the
captain
i
will
go
and
mark
the
result
on
my
chart
now
have
the
brought
in
that
is
a
work
of
several
hours
meanwhile
the
engineer
shall
have
his
fires
lighted
and
we
shall
be
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
you
have
done
it
is
and
with
your
permission
lieutenant
i
shall
turn
in
certainly
sir
certainly
answered
lieutenant
bronsfield
amiably
the
captain
of
the
susquehanna
a
worthy
man
if
ever
there
was
one
the
very
humble
servant
of
his
officers
went
to
his
cabin
took
his
with
many
expressions
of
satisfaction
to
the
steward
got
into
bed
not
before
complimenting
his
servant
on
the
way
he
made
beds
and
sank
into
peaceful
slumber
it
was
then
the
eleventh
day
of
the
month
of
december
was
going
to
end
in
a
magnificent
night
the
susquehanna
a
corvette
of
horse
power
of
the
united
states
navy
was
taking
soundings
in
the
pacific
at
about
a
hundred
leagues
from
the
american
coast
abreast
of
that
long
peninsula
on
the
coast
of
new
mexico
the
wind
had
gradually
fallen
there
was
not
the
slightest
movement
in
the
air
the
colours
of
the
corvette
hung
from
the
mast
motionless
and
inert
the
captain
jonathan
blomsberry
to
colonel
blomsberry
one
of
the
gun
club
members
who
had
married
a
horschbidden
the
captain
aunt
and
daughter
of
an
honourable
kentucky
merchant
captain
blomsberry
could
not
have
wished
for
better
weather
to
execute
the
delicate
operation
of
sounding
his
corvette
had
felt
nothing
of
that
great
tempest
which
swept
away
the
clouds
heaped
up
on
the
rocky
mountains
and
allowed
the
course
of
the
famous
projectile
to
be
observed
all
was
going
on
well
and
he
did
not
forget
to
thank
heaven
with
all
the
fervour
of
a
presbyterian
the
series
of
soundings
executed
by
the
susquehanna
were
intended
for
finding
out
the
most
favourable
bottoms
for
the
establishment
of
a
submarine
cable
between
the
hawaiian
islands
and
the
american
coast
it
was
a
vast
project
set
on
foot
by
a
powerful
company
its
director
the
intelligent
cyrus
field
meant
even
to
cover
all
the
islands
of
oceania
with
a
vast
electric
network
an
immense
enterprise
worthy
of
american
genius
it
was
to
the
corvette
susquehanna
that
the
first
operations
of
sounding
had
been
entrusted
during
the
night
from
the
to
the
of
december
she
was
exactly
in
north
lat
and
west
from
the
washington
meridian
the
moon
then
in
her
last
quarter
began
to
show
herself
above
the
horizon
after
captain
blomsberry
departure
lieutenant
bronsfield
and
a
few
officers
were
together
on
the
poop
as
the
moon
appeared
their
thoughts
turned
towards
that
orb
which
the
eyes
of
a
whole
hemisphere
were
then
contemplating
the
best
marine
glasses
could
not
have
discovered
the
projectile
wandering
round
the
and
yet
they
were
all
pointed
at
the
shining
disc
which
millions
of
eyes
were
looking
at
in
the
same
moment
they
started
ten
days
ago
then
said
lieutenant
bronsfield
what
can
have
become
of
them
they
have
arrived
sir
exclaimed
a
young
midshipman
and
they
are
doing
what
all
travellers
do
in
a
new
country
they
are
looking
about
them
i
am
certain
of
it
as
you
say
so
my
young
friend
answered
lieutenant
bronsfield
smiling
still
said
another
officer
their
arrival
can
not
be
doubted
the
projectile
must
have
reached
the
moon
at
the
moment
she
was
full
at
midnight
on
the
we
are
now
at
the
of
december
that
makes
six
days
now
in
six
times
hours
with
no
darkness
they
have
had
time
to
get
comfortably
settled
it
seems
to
me
that
i
see
our
brave
countrymen
encamped
at
the
bottom
of
a
valley
on
the
borders
of
a
selenite
stream
near
the
projectile
half
buried
by
its
fall
amidst
volcanic
remains
captain
nicholl
beginning
his
levelling
operations
president
barbicane
putting
his
travelling
notes
in
order
michel
ardan
performing
the
lunar
solitudes
with
his
londr√®s
cigar
oh
it
must
be
so
it
is
so
exclaimed
the
young
midshipman
enthusiastic
at
the
ideal
description
of
his
superior
i
should
like
to
believe
it
answered
lieutenant
bronsfield
who
was
seldom
carried
away
unfortunately
direct
news
from
the
lunar
world
will
always
be
wanting
excuse
me
sir
said
the
midshipman
but
can
not
president
barbicane
write
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
this
answer
not
letters
answered
the
young
man
quickly
the
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
perhaps
you
mean
the
said
one
of
the
officers
ironically
nor
that
either
answered
the
midshipman
who
would
not
give
in
but
it
is
very
easy
to
establish
graphic
communication
with
the
earth
and
how
pray
by
means
of
the
telescope
on
long
peak
you
know
that
it
brings
the
moon
to
within
two
leagues
only
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
that
it
allows
them
to
see
objects
having
nine
feet
of
diameter
on
her
surface
well
our
industrious
friends
will
construct
a
gigantic
alphabet
they
will
write
words
feet
long
and
sentences
a
league
long
and
then
they
can
send
up
news
the
young
midshipman
who
certainly
had
some
imagination
was
loudly
applauded
lieutenant
bronsfield
himself
was
convinced
that
the
idea
could
have
been
carried
out
he
added
that
by
sending
luminous
rays
grouped
by
means
of
parabolical
mirrors
direct
communications
could
also
be
established
in
fact
these
rays
would
be
as
visible
on
the
surface
of
venus
or
mars
as
the
planet
neptune
is
from
the
earth
he
ended
by
saying
that
the
brilliant
points
already
observed
on
the
nearest
planets
might
be
signals
made
to
the
earth
but
he
said
that
though
by
these
means
they
could
have
news
from
the
lunar
world
they
could
not
send
any
from
the
terrestrial
world
unless
the
selenites
have
at
their
disposition
instruments
with
which
to
make
distant
observations
that
is
evident
answered
one
of
the
officers
but
what
has
become
of
the
travellers
what
have
they
done
what
have
they
seen
that
is
what
interests
us
besides
if
the
experiment
has
succeeded
which
i
do
not
doubt
it
will
be
done
again
the
columbiad
is
still
walled
up
in
the
soil
of
florida
it
is
therefore
now
only
a
question
of
powder
and
shot
and
every
time
the
moon
passes
the
zenith
we
can
send
it
a
cargo
of
visitors
it
is
evident
answered
lieutenant
bronsfield
that
maston
will
go
and
join
his
friends
one
of
these
days
if
he
will
have
me
exclaimed
the
midshipman
i
am
ready
to
go
with
him
oh
there
will
be
plenty
of
amateurs
and
if
they
are
allowed
to
go
half
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
will
soon
have
emigrated
to
the
moon
this
conversation
between
the
officers
of
the
susquehanna
was
kept
up
till
about
it
would
be
impossible
to
transcribe
the
overwhelming
systems
and
theories
which
were
emitted
by
these
audacious
minds
since
barbicane
attempt
it
seemed
that
nothing
was
impossible
to
americans
they
had
already
formed
the
project
of
sending
not
another
commission
of
but
a
whole
colony
and
a
whole
army
of
infantry
artillery
and
cavalry
to
conquer
the
lunar
world
at
the
was
not
all
hauled
in
ten
thousand
feet
remained
out
which
would
take
several
more
hours
to
bring
in
according
to
the
commander
orders
the
fires
had
been
lighted
and
the
pressure
was
going
up
already
the
susquehanna
might
have
started
at
once
at
that
very
moment
it
was
lieutenant
bronsfield
was
about
to
leave
his
watch
to
turn
in
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
distant
and
quite
unexpected
hissing
sound
his
comrades
and
he
at
first
thought
that
the
hissing
came
from
an
escape
of
steam
but
upon
lifting
up
his
head
he
found
that
it
was
high
up
in
the
air
they
had
not
time
to
question
each
other
before
the
hissing
became
of
frightful
intensity
and
suddenly
to
their
dazzled
eyes
appeared
an
enormous
bolis
inflamed
by
the
rapidity
of
its
course
by
its
friction
against
the
atmospheric
strata
this
ignited
mass
grew
huger
as
it
came
nearer
and
fell
with
the
noise
of
thunder
upon
the
bowsprit
of
the
corvette
which
it
smashed
off
close
to
the
stem
and
vanished
in
the
waves
a
few
feet
nearer
and
the
susquehanna
would
have
gone
down
with
all
on
board
at
that
moment
captain
blomsberry
appeared
and
rushing
in
the
forecastle
where
his
officers
had
preceded
him
with
your
permission
gentlemen
what
has
happened
he
asked
and
the
midshipman
making
himself
the
mouthpiece
of
them
all
cried
out
commander
it
is
come
back
again
chapter
xxi
maston
called
in
emotion
was
great
on
board
the
susquehanna
officers
and
sailors
forgot
the
terrible
danger
they
had
just
been
in
the
danger
of
being
crushed
and
sunk
they
only
thought
of
the
catastrophe
which
terminated
the
journey
thus
therefore
the
moat
audacious
enterprise
of
ancient
and
modern
times
lost
the
life
of
the
bold
adventurers
who
had
attempted
it
it
is
come
back
the
young
midshipman
had
said
and
they
had
all
understood
no
one
doubted
that
the
bolis
was
the
projectile
of
the
gun
club
opinions
were
divided
about
the
fate
of
the
travellers
they
are
dead
said
one
they
are
alive
answered
the
other
the
water
is
deep
here
and
the
shock
has
been
deadened
but
they
will
have
no
air
and
will
die
suffocated
burnt
answered
the
other
their
projectile
was
only
an
incandescent
mass
as
it
crossed
the
atmosphere
what
does
it
matter
was
answered
unanimously
living
or
dead
they
must
be
brought
up
from
there
meanwhile
captain
blomsberry
had
called
his
officers
together
and
with
their
permission
he
held
a
council
something
must
be
done
immediately
the
most
immediate
was
to
haul
up
the
projectile
a
difficult
operation
but
not
an
impossible
one
but
the
corvette
wanted
the
necessary
engines
which
would
have
to
be
powerful
and
precise
it
was
therefore
resolved
to
put
into
the
nearest
port
and
to
send
word
to
the
gun
club
about
the
fall
of
the
bullet
this
determination
was
taken
unanimously
the
choice
of
a
port
was
discussed
the
neighbouring
coast
had
no
harbour
on
the
degree
of
latitude
higher
up
above
the
peninsula
of
monterey
was
the
important
town
which
has
given
its
name
to
it
but
seated
on
the
confines
of
a
veritable
desert
it
had
no
telegraphic
communication
with
the
interior
and
electricity
alone
could
spread
the
important
news
quickly
enough
some
degrees
above
lay
the
bay
of
san
francisco
through
the
capital
of
the
gold
country
communication
with
the
centre
of
the
union
would
be
easy
by
putting
all
steam
on
the
susquehanna
in
less
than
two
days
could
reach
the
port
of
san
francisco
she
must
therefore
start
at
once
the
fires
were
heaped
up
and
they
could
set
sail
immediately
two
thousand
fathoms
of
sounding
still
remained
in
the
water
captain
blomsberry
would
not
lose
precious
time
in
hauling
it
in
and
resolved
to
cut
the
line
we
will
fix
the
end
to
a
buoy
said
he
and
the
buoy
will
indicate
the
exact
point
where
the
projectile
fell
besides
answered
lieutenant
bronsfield
we
have
our
exact
bearings
north
lat
and
west
long
very
well
bronsfield
answered
the
captain
with
your
permission
have
the
line
cut
a
strong
buoy
reinforced
by
a
couple
of
spars
was
thrown
out
on
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
end
of
the
line
was
solidly
struck
beneath
and
only
submitted
to
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
surges
so
that
it
would
not
drift
much
at
that
moment
the
engineer
came
to
warn
the
captain
that
he
had
put
the
pressure
on
and
they
could
start
the
captain
thanked
him
for
his
excellent
communication
then
he
gave
as
the
route
the
corvette
was
put
about
and
made
for
the
bay
of
san
francisco
with
all
steam
on
it
was
then
two
hundred
leagues
to
get
over
was
not
much
for
a
quick
vessel
like
the
susquehanna
it
got
over
that
distance
in
hours
and
on
the
of
december
at
she
would
enter
the
bay
of
san
francisco
at
the
sight
of
this
vessel
of
the
national
navy
arriving
with
all
speed
on
her
bowsprit
gone
and
her
mainmast
propped
up
public
curiosity
was
singularly
excited
a
compact
crowd
was
soon
assembled
on
the
quays
awaiting
the
landing
after
weighing
anchor
captain
blomsberry
and
lieutenant
bronsfield
got
down
into
an
boat
which
carried
them
rapidly
to
the
land
they
jumped
out
on
the
quay
the
they
asked
without
answering
one
of
the
thousand
questions
that
were
showered
upon
them
the
port
inspector
guided
them
himself
to
the
amidst
an
immense
crowd
of
curious
people
blomsberry
and
bronsfield
went
into
the
office
whilst
the
crowd
crushed
against
the
door
a
few
minutes
later
one
message
was
sent
in
four
different
directions
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
washington
to
the
of
the
gun
club
baltimore
to
the
honourable
maston
long
peak
rocky
mountains
to
the
of
the
cambridge
observatory
massachusetts
it
ran
as
follows
in
north
lat
and
west
long
the
projectile
of
the
columbiad
fell
into
the
pacific
on
december
at
am
send
blomsberry
commander
susquehanna
five
minutes
afterwards
the
whole
town
of
san
francisco
knew
the
tidings
before
the
different
states
of
the
union
had
intelligence
of
the
supreme
catastrophe
after
midnight
through
the
cable
the
whole
of
europe
knew
the
result
of
the
great
american
enterprise
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
effect
produced
throughout
the
world
by
the
unexpected
news
on
receipt
of
the
telegram
the
secretary
of
the
navy
telegraphed
to
the
susquehanna
to
keep
under
fire
and
wait
in
the
bay
of
san
francisco
she
was
to
be
ready
to
set
sail
day
or
night
the
observatory
of
cambridge
had
an
extraordinary
meeting
and
with
the
serenity
which
distinguishes
scientific
bodies
it
peacefully
discussed
the
scientific
part
of
the
question
at
the
gun
club
there
was
an
explosion
all
the
artillerymen
were
assembled
the
the
honourable
wilcome
was
just
reading
the
premature
telegram
by
which
maston
and
belfast
announced
that
the
projectile
had
just
been
perceived
in
the
gigantic
reflector
of
long
peak
this
communication
informed
them
also
that
the
bullet
retained
by
the
attraction
of
the
moon
was
playing
the
part
of
in
the
solar
world
the
truth
on
this
subject
is
now
known
however
upon
the
arrival
of
blomsberry
message
which
so
formally
contradicted
maston
telegram
two
parties
were
formed
in
the
bosom
of
the
gun
club
on
the
one
side
were
members
who
admitted
the
fall
of
the
projectile
and
consequently
the
return
of
the
travellers
on
the
other
were
those
who
holding
by
the
observations
at
long
peak
concluded
that
the
commander
of
the
susquehanna
was
mistaken
according
to
the
latter
the
pretended
projectile
was
only
a
bolis
nothing
but
a
bolis
a
shooting
star
which
in
its
fall
had
fractured
the
corvette
their
argument
could
not
very
well
be
answered
because
the
velocity
with
which
it
was
endowed
had
made
its
observation
very
difficult
the
commander
of
the
susquehanna
and
his
officers
might
certainly
have
been
mistaken
in
good
faith
one
argument
certainly
was
in
their
favour
if
the
projectile
had
fallen
on
the
earth
it
must
have
touched
the
terrestrial
spheroid
upon
the
degree
of
north
latitude
and
taking
into
account
the
time
that
had
elapsed
and
the
earth
movement
of
rotation
between
the
and
degree
of
west
longitude
however
that
might
be
it
was
unanimously
decided
in
the
gun
club
that
blomsberry
brother
bilsby
and
major
elphinstone
should
start
at
once
for
san
francisco
and
give
their
advice
about
the
means
of
dragging
up
the
projectile
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
these
men
started
without
losing
an
instant
and
the
railway
which
was
soon
to
cross
the
whole
of
central
america
took
them
to
louis
where
rapid
awaited
them
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
of
the
gun
club
and
the
of
the
observatory
received
the
telegram
from
san
francisco
the
honourable
maston
felt
the
most
violent
emotion
of
his
whole
existence
an
emotion
not
even
equalled
by
that
he
had
experienced
when
his
celebrated
cannon
was
blown
up
and
which
like
it
nearly
cost
him
his
life
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
had
started
some
minutes
after
the
projectile
and
almost
as
quickly
for
the
station
of
long
peak
in
the
rocky
mountains
the
learned
belfast
director
of
the
cambridge
observatory
accompanied
him
arrived
at
the
station
the
two
friends
had
summarily
installed
themselves
and
no
longer
left
the
summit
of
their
enormous
telescope
we
know
that
this
gigantic
instrument
had
been
set
up
on
the
reflecting
system
called
front
view
by
the
english
this
arrangement
only
gave
one
reflection
of
objects
and
consequently
made
the
view
much
clearer
the
result
was
that
maston
and
belfast
whilst
observing
were
stationed
in
the
upper
part
of
the
instrument
instead
of
in
the
lower
they
reached
it
by
a
twisted
staircase
a
masterpiece
of
lightness
and
below
them
lay
the
metal
well
terminated
by
the
metallic
mirror
feet
deep
now
it
was
upon
the
narrow
platform
placed
round
the
telescope
that
the
two
passed
their
existence
cursing
the
daylight
which
hid
the
moon
from
their
eyes
and
the
clouds
which
obstinately
veiled
her
at
night
who
can
depict
their
delight
when
after
waiting
several
days
during
the
night
of
december
they
perceived
the
vehicle
that
was
carrying
their
friends
through
space
to
that
delight
succeeded
deep
disappointment
when
trusting
to
incomplete
observations
they
sent
out
with
their
first
telegram
to
the
world
the
erroneous
affirmation
that
the
projectile
had
become
a
satellite
of
the
moon
gravitating
in
an
immutable
orbit
after
that
instant
the
bullet
disappeared
behind
the
invisible
disc
of
the
moon
but
when
it
ought
to
have
reappeared
on
the
invisible
disc
the
impatience
of
maston
and
his
no
less
impatient
companion
may
be
imagined
at
every
minute
of
the
night
they
thought
they
should
see
the
projectile
again
and
they
did
not
see
it
hence
between
them
arose
endless
discussions
and
violent
disputes
belfast
affirming
that
the
projectile
was
not
visible
maston
affirming
that
any
one
but
a
blind
man
could
see
it
it
is
the
bullet
repeated
maston
no
answered
belfast
it
is
an
avalanche
falling
from
a
lunar
mountain
well
then
we
shall
see
it
no
it
will
be
seen
no
more
it
is
carried
away
into
space
we
shall
see
it
i
tell
you
no
we
shall
not
and
while
these
interjections
were
being
showered
like
hail
the
irritability
of
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
constituted
a
permanent
danger
to
the
director
belfast
their
existence
together
would
soon
have
become
impossible
but
an
unexpected
event
cut
short
these
eternal
discussions
during
the
night
between
the
and
of
december
the
two
irreconcilable
friends
were
occupied
in
observing
the
lunar
disc
maston
was
as
usual
saying
strong
things
to
the
learned
belfast
who
was
getting
angry
too
the
secretary
of
the
gun
club
declared
for
the
thousandth
time
that
he
had
just
perceived
the
projectile
adding
even
that
michel
ardan
face
had
appeared
at
one
of
the
he
was
emphasising
his
arguments
by
a
series
of
gestures
which
his
redoubtable
hook
rendered
dangerous
at
that
moment
belfast
servant
appeared
upon
the
platform
it
was
and
gave
him
a
telegram
it
was
the
message
from
the
commander
of
the
susquehanna
belfast
tore
the
envelope
read
the
inclosure
and
uttered
a
cry
what
is
it
said
maston
it
the
bullet
what
of
that
it
has
fallen
upon
the
earth
another
cry
this
time
a
howl
answered
him
he
turned
towards
maston
the
unfortunate
fellow
leaning
imprudently
over
the
metal
tube
had
disappeared
down
the
immense
telescope
a
fall
of
feet
belfast
distracted
rushed
towards
the
orifice
of
the
reflector
he
breathed
again
maston
steel
hook
had
caught
in
one
of
the
props
which
maintained
the
platform
of
the
telescope
he
was
uttering
formidable
cries
belfast
called
help
came
and
the
imprudent
secretary
was
hoisted
up
not
without
trouble
he
reappeared
unhurt
at
the
upper
orifice
suppose
i
had
broken
the
mirror
said
he
you
would
have
paid
for
it
answered
belfast
severely
and
where
has
the
infernal
bullet
fallen
asked
maston
into
the
pacific
let
us
start
at
once
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
the
two
learned
friends
were
descending
the
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
two
days
afterwards
they
reached
san
francisco
at
the
same
time
as
their
friends
of
the
gun
club
having
killed
five
horses
on
the
road
elphinstone
blomsberry
and
bilsby
rushed
up
to
them
upon
their
arrival
what
is
to
be
done
they
exclaimed
the
bullet
must
be
fished
up
answered
maston
and
as
soon
as
possible
chapter
xxii
picked
up
the
very
spot
where
the
projectile
had
disappeared
under
the
waves
was
exactly
known
the
instruments
for
seizing
it
and
bringing
it
to
the
surface
of
the
ocean
were
still
wanting
they
had
to
be
invented
and
then
manufactured
american
engineers
could
not
be
embarrassed
by
such
a
trifle
the
once
established
and
steam
helping
they
were
assured
of
raising
the
projectile
notwithstanding
its
weight
which
diminished
the
density
of
the
liquid
amidst
which
it
was
plunged
but
it
was
not
enough
to
fish
up
the
bullet
it
was
necessary
to
act
promptly
in
the
interest
of
the
travellers
no
one
doubted
that
they
were
still
living
yes
repeated
maston
incessantly
whose
confidence
inspired
everybody
our
friends
are
clever
fellows
and
they
can
not
have
fallen
like
imbeciles
they
are
alive
alive
and
well
but
we
must
make
haste
in
order
to
find
them
so
he
had
no
anxiety
about
provisions
and
water
they
had
enough
for
a
long
time
but
air
air
would
soon
fail
them
then
they
must
make
haste
and
they
did
make
haste
they
prepared
the
susquehanna
for
her
new
destination
her
powerful
engines
were
arranged
to
be
used
for
the
hauling
machines
the
aluminium
projectile
only
weighed
a
much
less
weight
than
that
of
the
transatlantic
cable
which
was
picked
up
under
similar
circumstances
the
only
difficulty
lay
in
the
smooth
sides
of
the
bullet
which
made
it
difficult
to
grapple
with
that
end
in
view
the
engineer
murchison
summoned
to
san
francisco
caused
enormous
to
be
fitted
upon
an
automatical
system
which
would
not
let
the
projectile
go
again
if
they
succeeded
in
seizing
it
with
their
powerful
pincers
he
also
had
some
prepared
which
by
their
impermeable
and
resisting
texture
allowed
divers
to
survey
the
bottom
of
the
sea
he
likewise
embarked
on
board
the
susquehanna
apparatuses
for
compressed
air
very
ingeniously
contrived
they
were
veritable
rooms
with
in
them
and
which
by
introducing
the
water
into
certain
compartments
could
be
sunk
to
great
depths
these
apparatuses
were
already
at
san
francisco
where
they
had
been
used
in
the
construction
of
a
submarine
dyke
this
was
fortunate
for
there
would
not
have
been
time
to
make
them
yet
notwithstanding
the
perfection
of
the
apparatus
notwithstanding
the
ingenuity
of
the
who
were
to
use
them
the
success
of
the
operation
was
anything
but
assured
fishing
up
a
bullet
from
feet
under
water
must
be
an
uncertain
operation
and
even
if
the
bullet
should
again
be
brought
to
the
surface
how
had
the
travellers
borne
the
terrible
shock
that
even
feet
of
water
would
not
sufficiently
deaden
in
short
everything
must
be
done
quickly
maston
hurried
on
his
workmen
day
and
night
he
was
ready
either
to
buckle
on
the
dress
or
to
try
the
in
order
to
find
his
courageous
friends
still
notwithstanding
the
diligence
with
which
the
different
machines
were
got
ready
notwithstanding
the
considerable
sums
which
were
placed
at
the
disposition
of
the
gun
club
by
the
government
of
the
union
five
long
days
five
centuries
went
by
before
the
preparations
were
completed
during
that
time
public
opinion
was
excited
to
the
highest
point
telegrams
were
incessantly
exchanged
all
over
the
world
through
the
electric
wires
and
cables
the
saving
of
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
became
an
international
business
all
the
nations
that
had
subscribed
to
the
enterprise
of
the
gun
club
were
equally
interested
in
the
safety
of
the
travellers
at
last
the
and
automatic
were
embarked
on
board
the
susquehanna
maston
the
engineer
murchison
and
the
gun
club
delegates
already
occupied
their
cabins
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
start
on
the
of
december
at
the
corvette
set
sail
on
a
calm
sea
with
a
rather
cold
wind
blowing
all
the
population
of
san
francisco
crowded
on
to
the
quays
mute
and
anxious
reserving
its
hurrahs
for
the
return
the
steam
was
put
on
to
its
maximum
of
tension
and
the
screw
of
the
susquehanna
carried
it
rapidly
out
of
the
bay
it
would
be
useless
to
relate
the
conversations
on
board
amongst
the
officers
sailors
and
passengers
all
these
men
had
but
one
thought
their
hearts
all
beat
with
the
same
emotion
what
were
barbicane
and
his
companions
doing
whilst
they
were
hastening
to
their
succour
what
had
become
of
them
had
they
been
able
to
attempt
some
audacious
manoeuvre
to
recover
their
liberty
no
one
could
say
the
truth
is
that
any
attempt
would
have
failed
sunk
to
nearly
two
leagues
under
the
ocean
their
metal
prison
would
defy
any
effort
of
its
prisoners
on
the
of
december
at
after
a
rapid
passage
the
susquehanna
ought
to
be
on
the
scene
of
the
disaster
they
were
obliged
to
wait
till
twelve
to
take
their
exact
bearings
the
buoy
fastened
on
to
the
had
not
yet
been
seen
at
noon
captain
blomsberry
helped
by
his
officers
who
controlled
the
observation
made
his
point
in
presence
of
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
that
was
an
anxious
moment
the
susquehanna
was
found
to
be
at
some
minutes
west
of
the
very
spot
where
the
projectile
had
disappeared
under
the
waves
the
direction
of
the
corvette
was
therefore
given
in
view
of
reaching
the
precise
spot
at
the
buoy
was
sighted
it
was
in
perfect
order
and
did
not
seem
to
have
drifted
far
at
last
exclaimed
maston
shall
we
begin
asked
captain
blomsberry
without
losing
a
second
answered
maston
every
precaution
was
taken
to
keep
the
corvette
perfectly
motionless
before
trying
to
grapple
the
projectile
the
engineer
murchison
wished
to
find
out
its
exact
position
on
the
the
submarine
apparatus
destined
for
this
search
received
their
provision
of
air
the
handling
of
these
engines
is
not
without
danger
for
at
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
water
and
under
such
great
pressure
they
are
exposed
to
ruptures
the
consequences
of
which
would
be
terrible
maston
the
commander
brother
and
the
engineer
murchison
without
a
thought
of
these
dangers
took
their
places
in
the
the
commander
on
his
presided
over
the
operation
ready
to
stop
or
haul
in
his
chains
at
the
least
signal
the
screw
had
been
taken
off
and
all
the
force
of
the
machines
upon
the
windlass
would
soon
have
brought
up
the
apparatus
on
board
the
descent
began
at
and
the
chamber
dragged
down
by
its
reservoirs
filled
with
water
disappeared
under
the
surface
of
the
ocean
the
emotion
of
the
officers
and
sailors
on
board
was
now
divided
between
the
prisoners
in
the
projectile
and
the
prisoners
of
the
submarine
apparatus
these
latter
forgot
themselves
and
glued
to
the
panes
of
the
they
attentively
observed
the
liquid
masses
they
were
passing
through
the
descent
was
rapid
at
maston
and
his
companions
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
pacific
but
they
saw
nothing
except
the
arid
desert
which
neither
marine
flora
nor
fauna
any
longer
animated
by
the
light
of
their
lamps
furnished
with
powerful
reflectors
they
could
observe
the
dark
layers
of
water
in
a
rather
large
radius
but
the
projectile
remained
invisible
in
their
eyes
the
impatience
of
these
bold
divers
could
hardly
be
described
their
apparatus
being
in
electric
communication
with
the
corvette
they
made
a
signal
agreed
upon
and
the
susquehanna
carried
their
chamber
over
a
mile
of
space
at
one
yard
from
the
soil
they
thus
explored
all
the
submarine
plain
deceived
at
every
instant
by
optical
delusions
which
cut
them
to
the
heart
here
a
rock
there
a
swelling
of
the
ground
looked
to
them
like
the
projectile
then
they
would
soon
find
out
their
error
and
despair
again
where
are
they
where
can
they
be
cried
maston
and
the
poor
man
called
aloud
to
nicholl
barbicane
and
michel
ardan
as
if
his
unfortunate
friends
could
have
heard
him
through
that
impenetrable
medium
the
search
went
on
under
those
conditions
until
the
vitiated
state
of
the
air
in
the
apparatus
forced
the
divers
to
go
up
again
the
hauling
in
was
begun
at
and
was
not
terminated
before
midnight
we
will
try
again
said
maston
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
deck
of
the
corvette
yes
answered
captain
blomsberry
and
in
another
place
yes
maston
did
not
yet
doubt
of
his
ultimate
success
but
his
companions
who
were
no
longer
intoxicated
with
the
animation
of
the
first
few
hours
already
took
in
all
the
difficulties
of
the
enterprise
what
seemed
easy
at
san
francisco
in
open
ocean
appeared
almost
impossible
the
chances
of
success
diminished
in
a
large
proportion
and
it
was
to
chance
alone
that
the
finding
of
the
projectile
had
to
be
left
the
next
day
the
of
december
notwithstanding
the
fatigues
of
the
preceding
day
operations
were
resumed
the
corvette
moved
some
minutes
farther
west
and
the
apparatus
provisioned
with
air
again
took
the
same
explorers
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
all
that
day
was
passed
in
a
fruitless
search
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
a
desert
the
day
of
the
brought
no
result
neither
did
that
of
the
it
was
disheartening
they
thought
of
the
unfortunate
men
shut
up
for
days
in
the
projectile
perhaps
they
were
all
feeling
the
first
symptoms
of
suffocation
even
if
they
had
escaped
the
dangers
of
their
fall
the
air
was
getting
exhausted
and
doubtless
with
the
air
their
courage
and
spirits
the
air
very
likely
but
their
courage
never
said
maston
on
the
after
two
days
search
all
hope
was
lost
this
bullet
was
an
atom
in
the
immensity
of
the
sea
they
must
give
up
the
hope
of
finding
it
still
maston
would
not
hear
about
leaving
he
would
not
abandon
the
place
without
having
at
least
found
the
tomb
of
his
friends
but
captain
blomsberry
could
not
stay
on
obstinately
and
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
the
worthy
secretary
he
was
obliged
to
give
orders
to
set
sail
on
the
of
december
at
the
susquehanna
heading
began
to
return
to
the
bay
of
san
francisco
it
was
the
corvette
was
leaving
slowly
and
as
if
with
regret
the
scene
of
the
catastrophe
when
the
sailor
at
the
masthead
who
was
on
the
called
out
all
at
once
a
buoy
on
the
lee
bow
the
officers
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
they
saw
through
their
telescopes
the
object
signalled
which
did
look
like
one
of
those
buoys
used
for
marking
the
openings
of
bays
or
rivers
but
unlike
them
a
flag
floating
in
the
wind
surmounted
a
cone
which
emerged
five
or
six
feet
this
buoy
shone
in
the
sunshine
as
if
made
of
plates
of
silver
the
commander
blomsberry
maston
and
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
ascended
the
and
examined
the
object
thus
drifting
on
the
waves
all
looked
with
feverish
anxiety
but
in
silence
none
of
them
dared
utter
the
thought
that
came
into
all
their
minds
the
corvette
approached
to
within
two
cables
length
of
the
object
a
shudder
ran
through
the
whole
crew
the
flag
was
an
american
one
at
that
moment
a
veritable
roar
was
heard
it
was
the
worthy
maston
who
had
fallen
in
a
heap
forgetting
on
the
one
hand
that
he
had
only
an
iron
hook
for
one
arm
and
on
the
other
that
a
simple
cap
covered
his
he
had
given
himself
a
formidable
blow
they
rushed
towards
him
and
picked
him
up
they
recalled
him
to
life
and
what
were
his
first
words
ah
triple
brutes
quadruple
idiots
quintuple
boobies
that
we
are
what
is
the
matter
every
one
round
him
exclaimed
what
the
matter
is
speak
ca
you
it
is
imbeciles
shouted
the
terrible
secretary
it
is
the
bullet
only
weighs
lbs
well
and
it
displaces
tons
or
consequently
ah
how
that
worthy
man
did
underline
the
verb
to
float
and
it
was
the
truth
all
yes
all
these
had
forgotten
this
fundamental
law
that
in
consequence
of
its
specific
lightness
the
projectile
after
having
been
dragged
by
its
fall
to
the
greatest
depths
of
the
ocean
had
naturally
returned
to
the
surface
and
now
it
was
floating
tranquilly
whichever
way
the
wind
carried
them
the
boats
had
been
lowered
maston
and
his
friends
rushed
into
them
the
excitement
was
at
its
highest
point
all
hearts
palpitated
whilst
the
boats
rowed
towards
the
projectile
what
did
it
contain
the
living
or
the
dead
the
living
yes
unless
death
had
struck
down
barbicane
and
his
companions
since
they
had
hoisted
the
flag
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
boats
all
hearts
stopped
beating
eyes
no
longer
performed
their
office
one
of
the
of
the
projectile
was
opened
some
pieces
of
glass
remaining
in
the
frame
proved
that
it
had
been
broken
this
was
situated
actually
five
feet
above
water
a
boat
drew
alongside
that
of
maston
he
rushed
to
the
broken
window
at
that
moment
the
joyful
and
clear
voice
of
michel
ardan
was
heard
exclaiming
in
the
accents
of
victory
double
blank
barbicane
double
blank
barbicane
michel
ardan
and
nicholl
were
playing
at
dominoes
chapter
xxiii
the
end
it
will
be
remembered
that
immense
sympathy
accompanied
the
three
travellers
upon
their
departure
if
the
beginning
of
their
enterprise
had
caused
such
excitement
in
the
old
and
new
world
what
enthusiasm
must
welcome
their
return
would
not
those
millions
of
spectators
who
had
invaded
the
floridian
peninsula
rush
to
meet
the
sublime
adventurers
would
those
legions
of
foreigners
from
all
points
of
the
globe
now
in
america
leave
the
union
without
seeing
barbicane
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
once
more
no
and
the
ardent
passion
of
the
public
would
worthily
respond
to
the
grandeur
of
the
enterprise
human
beings
who
had
left
the
terrestrial
spheroid
who
had
returned
after
their
strange
journey
into
celestial
space
could
not
fail
to
be
received
like
the
prophet
elijah
when
he
returned
to
the
earth
to
see
them
first
to
hear
them
afterwards
was
the
general
desire
this
desire
was
to
be
very
promptly
realised
by
almost
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
union
barbicane
michel
ardan
nicholl
and
the
delegates
of
the
gun
club
returned
without
delay
to
baltimore
and
were
there
received
with
indescribable
enthusiasm
the
president
travelling
notes
were
ready
to
be
given
up
for
publicity
the
york
bought
this
manuscript
at
a
price
which
is
not
yet
known
but
which
must
have
been
enormous
in
fact
during
the
publication
of
the
to
the
they
printed
copies
of
that
newspaper
three
days
after
the
return
to
the
earth
the
least
details
of
their
expedition
were
known
the
only
thing
remaining
to
be
done
was
to
see
the
heroes
of
this
superhuman
enterprise
the
exploration
of
barbicane
and
his
friends
around
the
moon
had
allowed
them
to
control
the
different
theories
about
the
terrestrial
satellite
these
had
observed
it
and
under
quite
peculiar
circumstances
it
was
now
known
which
systems
were
to
be
rejected
which
admitted
upon
the
formation
of
this
orb
its
origin
and
its
inhabitability
its
past
present
and
future
had
given
up
their
secrets
what
could
be
objected
to
conscientious
observations
made
at
less
than
forty
miles
from
that
curious
mountain
of
tycho
the
strangest
mountain
system
of
lunar
orography
what
answers
could
be
made
to
who
had
looked
into
the
dark
depths
of
the
amphitheatre
of
pluto
who
could
contradict
these
audacious
men
whom
the
hazards
of
their
enterprise
had
carried
over
the
invisible
disc
of
the
moon
which
no
human
eye
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
now
their
prerogative
to
impose
the
limits
of
that
selenographic
science
which
had
built
up
the
lunar
world
like
cuvier
did
the
skeleton
of
a
fossil
and
to
say
the
moon
was
this
a
world
inhabitable
and
inhabited
anterior
to
the
earth
the
moon
is
this
a
world
now
uninhabitable
and
uninhabited
in
order
to
welcome
the
return
of
the
most
illustrious
of
its
members
and
his
two
companions
the
gun
club
thought
of
giving
them
a
banquet
but
a
banquet
worthy
of
them
worthy
of
the
american
people
and
under
such
circumstances
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
union
could
take
a
direct
part
in
it
all
the
termini
of
the
railroads
in
the
state
were
joined
together
by
movable
rails
then
in
all
the
stations
hung
with
the
same
flags
decorated
with
the
same
ornaments
were
spread
tables
uniformly
dressed
at
a
certain
time
severely
calculated
upon
electric
clocks
which
beat
the
seconds
at
the
same
instant
the
inhabitants
were
invited
to
take
their
places
at
the
same
banquet
during
four
days
from
the
to
the
of
january
the
trains
were
suspended
like
they
are
on
sundays
upon
the
railways
of
the
union
and
all
the
lines
were
free
one
locomotive
alone
a
very
fast
engine
dragging
a
state
saloon
had
the
right
of
circulating
during
these
four
days
upon
the
railways
of
the
united
states
this
locomotive
conducted
by
a
stoker
and
a
mechanic
carried
by
a
great
favour
the
honourable
maston
secretary
of
the
gun
club
the
saloon
was
reserved
for
president
barbicane
captain
nicholl
and
michel
ardan
the
train
left
the
station
of
baltimore
upon
the
whistle
of
the
amidst
the
hurrahs
and
all
the
admiring
interjections
of
the
american
language
it
went
at
the
speed
of
eighty
leagues
an
hour
but
what
was
that
speed
compared
to
the
one
with
which
the
three
heroes
had
left
the
columbiad
thus
they
went
from
one
town
to
another
finding
the
population
in
crowds
upon
their
passage
saluting
them
with
the
same
acclamations
and
showering
upon
them
the
same
bravoes
they
thus
travelled
over
the
east
of
the
union
through
pennsylvania
connecticut
massachusetts
vermont
maine
and
new
brunswick
north
and
west
through
new
york
ohio
michigan
and
wisconsin
south
through
illinois
missouri
arkansas
texas
and
louisiana
through
alabama
and
florida
georgia
and
the
carolinas
they
visited
the
centre
through
tennessee
kentucky
virginia
and
indiana
then
after
the
station
of
washington
they
baltimore
and
during
four
days
they
could
imagine
that
the
united
states
of
america
seated
at
one
immense
banquet
saluted
them
simultaneously
with
the
same
hurrahs
this
apotheosis
was
worthy
of
these
heroes
whom
fable
would
have
placed
in
the
ranks
of
demigods
and
now
would
this
attempt
without
precedent
in
the
annals
of
travels
have
any
practical
result
would
direct
communication
ever
be
established
with
the
moon
would
a
service
of
navigation
ever
be
founded
across
space
for
the
solar
world
will
people
ever
go
from
planet
to
planet
from
jupiter
to
mercury
and
later
on
from
one
star
to
another
from
the
polar
star
to
sirius
would
a
method
of
locomotion
allow
of
visiting
the
suns
which
swarm
in
the
firmament
no
answer
can
be
given
to
these
questions
but
knowing
the
audacious
ingenuity
of
the
race
no
one
will
be
astonished
that
the
americans
tried
to
turn
president
barbicane
experiment
to
account
thus
some
time
after
the
return
of
the
travellers
the
public
received
with
marked
favour
the
advertisement
of
a
company
limited
with
a
capital
of
a
hundred
million
dollars
divided
into
a
hundred
thousand
shares
of
a
thousand
dollars
each
under
the
name
of
company
for
interstellar
president
barbicane
captain
nicholl
secretary
maston
director
michel
ardan
and
as
it
is
customary
in
america
to
foresee
everything
in
business
even
bankruptcy
the
honourable
harry
trollope
commissary
judge
and
francis
dayton
were
appointed
beforehand
assignees
