day
thirteen
years
ago
a
new
french
ambassador
presented
his
credentials
the
ambassador
was
not
very
old
for
an
ambassador
the
president
was
very
young
for
a
president
the
youngest
in
fact
the
united
states
ever
had
both
according
to
custom
read
set
speeches
and
there
followed
a
first
conversation
which
had
a
great
many
successors
touching
on
a
variety
of
subjects
not
connected
all
of
them
with
diplomacy
in
which
talk
took
part
the
genial
learned
and
author
of
the
pike
county
ballads
and
of
the
life
of
lincoln
present
at
the
meeting
as
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
was
the
first
direct
impression
the
newcomer
had
of
strenuous
america
his
earliest
ones
as
a
child
having
been
derived
from
the
illustrated
weekly
paper
received
by
his
family
and
which
offered
to
view
fancy
pictures
of
the
battles
between
the
bearded
soldiers
of
grant
and
lee
the
poilus
of
those
days
another
impression
was
from
cooper
tales
deerslayer
sharing
with
ivanhoe
the
enthusiasm
of
the
young
people
at
the
family
hearth
another
american
impression
was
received
by
them
a
little
later
when
the
republic
having
been
proclaimed
the
street
where
the
family
had
their
winter
home
ceased
to
be
called
rue
de
la
reine
and
became
rue
franklin
years
is
a
long
space
of
time
in
an
ambassador
life
it
is
not
an
insignificant
one
in
the
life
of
such
a
youthful
nation
as
the
united
states
i
have
now
witnessed
the
eleventh
part
of
that
life
something
like
or
of
the
population
has
been
added
since
i
began
service
here
there
were
states
then
instead
of
the
commercial
intercourse
with
france
was
half
of
what
it
is
now
the
tonnage
of
the
american
navy
was
less
than
half
what
it
is
at
present
the
panama
canal
was
not
yet
american
the
aeroplane
was
unknown
the
automobile
practically
unused

at
the
white
house
was
followed
by
many
others
little
enough
accustomed
up
to
then
to
addressing
any
assembly
at
any
time
i
did
not
expect
to
have
much
to
do
in
that
line
but
i
had
i
soon
found
that
it
was
not
a
question
of
taste
and
personal
disposition
but
one
of
courtesy
and
friendliness
the
audiences
of
america
ever
ready
to
show
appreciation
for
any
effort
greatly
facilitated
was
thus
led
by
degrees
to
address
gatherings
of
many
kinds
in
many
places
on
many
subjects
from
the
origins
of
the
war
of
independence
to
reforestation
in
america
and
from
the
civil
war
to
infantile
mortality
many
such
speeches
had
to
be
delivered
impromptu
others
luckily
for
both
orator
and
listeners
were
on
subjects
which
the
former
had
studied
with
as
much
care
as
the
fulfilling
of
a
variety
of
tasks
and
duties
had
allowed
examination
of
the
development
of
the
two
countries
will
i
believe
lead
any
impartial
mind
to
the
conclusion
that
with
so
many
peculiar
ties
between
them
in
the
past
a
similar
goal
ahead
of
them
and
to
a
great
extent
similar
hard
problems
to
solve
it
can
not
but
be
of
advantage
to
themselves
and
to
the
liberal
world
that
the
two
republics
facing
each
other
across
the
broad
ocean
one
nearly
half
a
century
old
the
other
three
times
as
much
should
ever
live
on
terms
of
amity
not
to
say
intimacy
comparing
experiences
of
help
to
one
another
whenever
circumstances
allow
this
they
have
been
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
will
doubtless
be
again
in
the
future
during
our
present
trials
the
active
generosity
of
american
men
and
women
has
exerted
itself
in
a
way
that

quite
recently
the
news
had
come
of
the
double
victory
at
sea
and
on
land
of
at
grenada
and
paris
had
been
illuminated
the
lights
were
scarcely
out
when
news
arrived
of
the
disaster
of
the
same
at
savannah
all
france
felt
anxious
concerning
the
issue
of
a
war
which
had
lasted
so
long
and
whose
end
continued
to
be
doubtful
when
in
the
first
months
of
the
report
went
about
that
a
great
definitive
effort
was
to
be
attempted
that
it
was
not
this
time
a
question
of
sending
ships
to
the
americans
but
of
sending
an
army
and
that
the
termination
of
the
great
drama
was
near
the
enthusiasm
was
unbounded
all
wanted
to
take
part
there
was
a
prospect
of
crossing
the
seas
of
succoring
a
people
fighting
for
a
sacred
cause
a
people
of
whom
all
our
volunteers
praised
the
virtues
the
people
led
by
washington
and
represented
in
paris
by
franklin
an
ardor
as
of
crusaders
inflamed
the
hearts
of
french
youths
and
the
intended
expedition
was
in
fact
the
most
important
that
france
had
launched
beyond
the
seas
since
the
distant
time
of
the
crusades
the
cause
was
a
truly
sacred
one
the
cause
of
liberty
a
magical
word
which
then
stirred
the
hearts
of
the
many
why
is
liberty
so
rare
voltaire
had
said
because
the
most
valuable
of
possessions
all
those
who
were
so
lucky
as
to
be
allowed
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
were
convinced
that
they
would
witness
memorable
perhaps
unique
events
and
it
turned
out
indeed
that
they
were
to
witness
a
campaign
which
with
the
battle
of
hastings
where
the
fate
of
england
was
decided
in
and
that
of
bouvines
which
made
of
france
in
a
great
nation
was
to
be
one
of
the
three
military
actions
with
greatest
consequences
in
which
for
the
last
thousand
years
the
french
had
participated
a
striking
result
of
this
state
of
mind
is
that
an
extraordinary
number
of
those
who
went
noted
down
their
impressions
kept
journals
drew
sketches
never
perhaps
during
a
military
campaign
was
so
much
writing
done
nor
were
so
many
albums
filled
with
drawings
notes
letters
journals
sketches
have
come
down
to
us
in
large
quantities
and
from
all

the

moreover

liberally
opened
its

so
that
both
through
the
recriminatory
pamphlets
printed
in

after

disaster
and

despatches
now

can
know

comte
de
rochambeau
aged
then
and
washington
senior
by
seven
years
was
in
his
house
still
in
existence
rue
du
paris
at
the
beginning
of
march
he
was
ill
and
about
to
leave
for
his
castle
of
rochambeau
in
vendomois
were
in
readiness
when
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
received
he
says
in
his
memoirs
a
courrier
bringing
him
the
order
to
go
to
versailles
and
receive
the
instructions
of
his
majesty
for
some
time
rumors
had
been
afloat
that
the
great
attempt
would
soon
be
made
he
was
informed
that
the
news
was
true
and
that
he
would
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
army
sent
to
the
assistance
of
the
americans
the
task
was
an
extraordinary
one
he
would
have
to
reach
the
new
world
with
a
body
of
troops
packed
on
slow
transports
to
avoid
the
english
fleets
to
fight
in
a
country
practically
unknown
by
the
side
of
men
not
less
so
and
whom
we
had
been
accustomed
to
fight
rather
than
befriend
and
for
a
cause
which
had
never
before
elicited
enthusiasm
at
versailles
the
cause
of
republican
liberty
this
last
point
was
the
strangest
of
all
so
strange
that
even
indians
friends
of
the
french
in
former
days
asked
rochambeau
when
they
saw
him
in
america
how
it
was
that
his
king
could
think
fit
to
help
other
people
against
their
own
father
their
king
rochambeau
replied
that
the
latter
had
been
too
hard
on
his
subjects
that
they
were
right
therefore
in
shaking
off
the
yoke
and
we
in
helping
them
to
secure
that
natural
liberty
which
god
has
conferred
on
man
this
answer
to
messieurs
les
sauvages
is
an
enlightening
one
it
shows
what
was
the
latent
force
that
surmounted
all
obstacles
and
caused
the
french
nation
to
stand
as
a
whole
from
beginning
to
end
in
favor
of
the
americans
to
applaud
a
treaty
of
alliance
which
while
entailing
the
gravest
risks
forbade
us
all
conquest
and
to
rejoice
enthusiastically
at
a
peace
which
after
a
victorious
war
added
nothing
to
our
possessions
this
force
was
the
increasing
passion
among
the
french
for
precisely
that
natural
liberty
which
god
has
conferred
on
man
hatred
of
england
quickened
though
it
had
been
by
the
harsh
conditions
of
the
treaty
of
paris
bereaving
us
of
canada
in
had
much
less
to
do
with
it
than
is
sometimes
alleged
such
a
feeling
existed
it
is
true
in
the
hearts
of
some
of
the
leaders
but
not
of
all
it
did
in
the
minds
also
of
some
of
the
officers
but
again
not
of
all
what
predominated
in
the
mass
of
the
nation
irrespective
of
any
other
consideration
was
sympathy
for
men
who
wanted
to
fight
injustice
and
to
be
free
the
cause
of
the
insurgents
was
popular
because
it
was
associated
with
the
notion
of
liberty
people
did
not
look
beyond
it
is
often
forgotten
that
this
time
was
not
in
france
a
period
of
anglophobia
but
of
anglomania

and
came
to
america
at
the
head

all
that
was

admired

when
possible
imitated

another
of
the
master
minds
of
the
day
the
economist
thinker
and
reformer
turgot
the
one
whose
advice
if
followed
would
have
possibly
secured
for
us
a
bloodless
revolution
was
of
the
same
opinion
in
the
famous
letter
written
by
him
on
the
of
march
to
his
english
friend
doctor
price
turgot
showed
himself
just
as
the
french
nation
was
ardently
but
not
he
deplored
the
impending
war
which
ought
to
have
been
avoided
by
acknowledging
in
time
the
folly
of
its
absurd
project
to
subjugate
the
americans
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
it
be
not
yet
a
commonplace
truth
to
say
that
no
nation
can
ever
have
the
right
to
govern
another
nation
that
such
a
government
has
no
other
foundation
than
force
which
is
also
the
foundation
of
brigandage
and
tyranny
that
a
tyranny
is
of
all
tyrannies
the
most
cruel
the
most
intolerable
and
the
one
which
leaves
the
least
resources
to
the
oppressed
for
a
multitude
does
not
calculate
does
not
feel
remorse
and
it
bestows
on
itself
glory
when
all
that
it
deserves
is
shame
the
americans
according
to
turgot
must
be
free
not
only
for
their
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
humanity
an
experiment
of
the
utmost
import
is
about
to
begin
and
should
succeed
he
added
this
the
worthy
forecast
of
a
generous
mind
it
is
impossible
not
to
form
wishes
for
that
people
to
reach
the
utmost
prosperity
it
is
capable
of
that
people
is
the
hope
of
mankind
it
must
show
to
the
world
by
its
example
that
men
can
be
free
and
tranquil
and
can
do
without
the
chains
that
tyrants
and
cheats
of
all
garb
have
tried
to
lay
on
them
under
pretense
of
public
good
it
must
give
the
example
of
political
liberty
religious
liberty
commercial
and
industrial
liberty
the
shelter
which
it
is
going
to
offer
to
the
oppressed
of
all
nations
will
console
the
earth
the
ease
with
which
men
will
be
able
to
avail
themselves
of
it
and
escape
the
effects
of
a
bad
government
will
oblige
governments
to
open
their
eyes
and
to
be
just
the
rest
of
the
world
will
perceive
by
degrees
the
emptiness
of
the
illusions
on
which
politicians
have
festered
toward
england
turgot
has
a
feeling
of
regret
on
account
of
its
policies
but
no
trace
of
animosity
and
on
the
contrary
the
belief
that
in
spite
of
what
some
people
of
note
were
alleging
the
absolutely
certain
loss
of
her
american
colonies
would
not
result
in
a
diminution
of
her
power
this
revolution
will
prove
maybe
as
profitable
to
you
as
to
america
not
less
characteristic
of
the
times
and
of
the
same
thinker
turn
of
mind
is
a
brief
memorial
written
by
him
for
the
king
shortly
after
when
captain
cook
was
making
his
third
voyage
of
discovery
the
one
from
which
he
never
returned
captain
cook
turgot
said
is
probably
on
his
way
back
to
europe
his
expedition
having
no
other
object
than
the
progress
of
human
knowledge
and
interesting
therefore
all
nations
it
would
be
worthy
of
the
king
magnanimity
not
to
allow
that
the
result
be
jeopardized
by
the
chances
of
war
orders
should
be
given
to
all
french
naval
officers
to
abstain
from
any
hostile
act
against
him
or
his
ship
and
allow
him
to
freely
continue
his
navigation
and
to
treat
him
in
every
respect
as
the
custom
is
to
treat
the
officers
and
ships
of
neutral
and
friendly
countries
the
king
assented
and
had
our
cruisers
notified
of
the
sort
of
sacred
character
which
they
would
have
to
recognize
in
that
ship
of
the
enemy
a
small
fact
in
itself
but
showing
the
difference
between
the
wars
in
those
days
and
in
ours
when
we
have
had
to
witness
the
wanton
destruction
of
the
louvain
library
the
shelling
of
the
reims
cathedral
and
the
arras
town
hall
an
immense
aspiration
was
growing
in
france
for
more
equality
fewer
privileges
simpler
lives
among
the
great
less
hard
ones
among
the
lowly
more
accessible
knowledge
the
free
discussion
by
all
of
the
common
interests
of
all
a
fact
of
deepest
import
struck
the
least
attentive
french
masses
were
becoming
more
and
more
thinking
masses
one
should
not
forget
that
between
the
end
of
the
american
revolution
and
the
beginning
of
the
french
one
only
six
years
elapsed
between
the
american
and
the
french
constitutions
but
four
years
at
the
very
time
of
the
yorktown
campaign
necker
was
issuing
his
celebrated
which
he
addressed
pro
forma
to
the
king
and
in
reality
to
the
nation
this
famous
account
of
the
condition
of
france
the
piece
of
printed
matter
which
was
most
widely
read
in
those
days
began
sire
but
ended
in
writing
this
i
have
proudly
counted
on
that
public
opinion
which
persons
may
try
to
crush
or
to
distort
but
which
in
spite
of
their
efforts
truth
and
justice
carry
along
in
their
wake
to
which
may
be
added
as
another
token
of
the
same
state
of
mind
that
the
then
famous
count
de
guibert
had
some
time
before
printed
his
on
so
full
of
advanced
ideas
notably
on
the
necessary
limitation
of
the
power
of
kings
that
it
had
been
suppressed
by
the
authorities
and
he
had
dedicated
it
not
to
a
prince
nor
to
any
man
but
to
his
mother
country
a
ma
patrie
six
years
after
the
end
of
the
american
war
on
january
the
king
of
france
ordered
the
drawing
up
of
the
famous
desiring
he
said
that
from
the
extremities
of
his
kingdom
and
the
most
unknown
habitations
every
one
should
be
assured
of
a
means
of
conveying
to
him
his
wishes
and
complaints
and
the
requesting
liberties
very
similar
to
those
of
the
americans
came
indeed
from
the
remotest
parts
of
france
the
work
of
everybody
of
sometimes
who
would
offer
excuses
for
their
wild
orthography
and
grammar
the
notes
and
letters
of
the
volunteers
of
our
revolution
sons
of
peasants
or
artisans
surprise
us
by
the
mass
of
general
ideas
and
views
which
abound
in
them
it
was
not
therefore
a
statement
of
small
import
that
franklin
had
conveyed
to
congress
when
he
wrote
from
france
the
united
bent
of
the
nation
is
manifestly
in
our
favor
and
he
deplored
elsewhere
that
some
could
think
that
an
appeal
to
france
own
interest
was
good
policy
telling
them
their
commerce
will
be
advantaged
by
our
success
and
that
it
is
in
their
to
help
us
seems
as
much
as
to
say
us
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
you
such
indiscreet
and
improper
language
has
been
sometimes
held
here
by
some
of
our
people
and
produced
no
good
effect
the
truth
is
he
said
also
that
this
nation
is
fond
of
glory
particularly
that
of
protecting
the
oppressed
the
treaty
of
commerce
accompanying
the
treaty
of
alliance
of
had
been
in
itself
a
justification
of
this
judgment
help
from
abroad
was
so
pressingly
needed
in
america
that
almost
any
advantages
requested
by
france
as
a
condition
would
have
been
granted
but
that
strange
sight
was
seen
advantages
being
offered
unasked
by
one
party
and
declined
by
the
other
france
decided
at
once
not
to
accept
anything
as
a
recompense
not
even
canada
if
that
were
wrested
from
the
english
in
spite
of
canada
having
been
french
from
the
first
and
having
but
recently
ceased
to
be
such
the
fight
was
not
for
recompense
but
for
liberty
and
franklin
could
write
to
congress
that
the
treaty
of
commerce
was
one
to
which
all
the
rest
of
the
world
in
accordance
with
france
own
wishes
was
free
to
accede
when
it
chose
on
the
same
footing
as
herself
england
included
this
was
so
peculiar
that
many
had
doubts
john
adams
never
lost
his
washington
himself
had
some
and
when
plans
were
submitted
to
him
for
an
action
in
canada
he
wondered
as
he
wrote
whether
there
was
not
in
them
more
than
the
disinterested
zeal
of
allies
what
would
take
place
at
the
peace
if
the
allies
were
victorious
would
not
france
require
in
one
form
or
another
some
advantages
for
herself
but
she
did
not
her
peace
was
to
be
like
her
war
rather
than
another
striking
trait
in
the
numerous
french
accounts
which
have
come
down
to
us
of
this
campaign
against
the
english
is
the
small
space
that
the
english
as
a
nation
occupy
in
them
the
note
that
predominates
is
enthusiasm
for
the
americans
not
hatred
for
their
enemies
in
france
wrote
ségur
in
his
memoirs
in
spite
of
the
habit
of
a
long
obedience
to
arbitrary
power
the
cause
of
the
american
insurgents
fixed
the
attention
and
excited
the
interest
of
all
from
every
side
public
opinion
was
pressing
the
royal
government
to
declare
itself
in
favor
of
republican
liberty
and
seemed
to
reproach
it
for
its
slowness
and
timidity
of
any
revenge
to
be
taken
on
the
enemy
not
a
word
no
one
among
us
he
said
further
thought
of
a
revolution
in
france
but
it
was
rapidly
taking
place
in
our
minds
montesquieu
had
brought
to
light
again
the
consecrating
the
rights
of
the
people
mature
men
were
studying
and
envying
the
laws
of
england
summing
up
the
motives
of
the
new
crusaders
who
were
starting
off
to
the
war
in
the
name
of
philanthropy
he
found
two
one
quite
reasonable
and
conscientious
the
desire
to
well
serve
king
and
country
another
more
unique
a
veritable
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
of
american
liberty
ministers
hesitated
on
account
of
the
greatness
of
the
risk
but
they
were
little
by
little
carried
away
by
the
torrent
during
the
sea
voyage
only
the
chiefs
knew
exactly
whither
they
were
going
some
officers
thought
at
one
time
they
might
have
to
fight
elsewhere
than
in
america
one
of
rochambeau
officers
the
aforementioned
confided
his
misgivings
to
his
journal
above
all
he
wrote
i
had
heartily
espoused
the
cause
of
the
independence
of
the
americans
and
i
should
have
felt
extreme
regret
at
losing
the
honor
of
combating
for
their
liberty
of
the
english
again
not
a
word
what
he
longed
for
like
so
many
others
was
less
to
fight
against
the
english
than
for
the
americans
more
striking
perhaps
than
all
the
rest
shortly
after
we
had
decided
to
take
part
in
the
war
the
question
of
our
motives
and
of
a
possible
annihilation
of
england
as
a
great
power
was
plainly
put
in
the
course
of
a
familiar
conversation
by
the
president
of
yale
university
to
the
future
signer
of
the
louisiana
treaty
then
secretary
of
our
legation
in
the
united
states
mons
marbois
ezra
stiles
confided
to
his
diary
on
the
occasion
of
the
french
minister
la
luzerne
and
his
secretary
visit
to
yale
is
a
learned
civilian
a
councillor
of
the
parliament
of
metz
æt
as
i
judge
speaks
english
very
tolerably
much
better
than
his
excellency
the
minister
he
was
very
inquisitive
for
books
and
american
histories
among
other
things
i
asked
mons
marbois
whether
the
powers
of
europe
would
contentedly
see
great
britain
annihilated
he
said
no
it
would
be
for
the
interest
of
europe
that
britain
should
have
weight
in
the
balances
of
power
france
did
not
want
to
enlarge
her
dominions
by
conquest
or
otherwise
for
the
french
diplomat
a
man
of
great
ability
and
well
informed
addressing
as
he
was
one
to
whom
a
yes
instead
of
a
no
would
have
caused
no
pain
far
from
it
the
motive
of
our
actions
was
neither
a
prospective
loss
by
england
of
her
rank
nor
the
increase
of
our
own
possessions
but
simply
american
independence
ii
aware
of
the
importance
and
difficulty
of
the
move
it
had
decided
upon
the
french
government
had
looked
for
a
trained
soldier
a
man
of
decision
and
of
sense
one
who
would
understand
washington
and
be
understood
by
him
would
keep
in
hand
the
enthusiasts
under
his
orders
and
would
avoid
risky
ventures
the
time
of
the
was
gone
definitive
results
were
to
be
sought
the
government
considered
it
could
do
no
better
than
to
select
rochambeau
it
could
indeed
do
no
better
the
future
marshal
of
france
had
been
first
destined
to
priesthood
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
was
a
second
son
and
he
was
about
to
receive
the
tonsure
when
his
elder
brother
died
and
bishop
de
crussol
who
had
been
supervising
donatien
ecclesiastical
studies
came
one
day
to
him
and
said
you
must
forget
all
i
have
told
you
up
to
now
you
have
become
the
eldest
of
your
family
and
you
must
now
serve
your
country
with
as
much
zeal
as
you
would
have
served
god
in
the
ecclesiastical
state
rochambeau
did
so
he
was
appointed
an
officer
and
served
on
his
first
campaign
in
germany
at
sixteen
fought
under
marshal
de
saxe
was
a
colonel
at
washington
was
to
become
one
also
at
received
at
laufeldt
his
two
first
wounds
of
which
he
nearly
died
at
the
head
of
the
famous
auvergne
regiment
auvergne
sans
tache
auvergne
the
spotless
as
it
was
called
he
took
part
in
the
chief
battles
of
the
seven
years
war
notably
in
the
victory
of
klostercamp
where
spotless
auvergne
had
officers
and
soldiers
killed
or
wounded
the
battle
made
memorable
by
the
episode
of
the
chevalier
who
went
to
his
heroic
death
in
the
fulfilment
of
an
order
given
by
rochambeau
the
latter
was
again
severely
wounded
but
leaning
on
two
soldiers
he
could
remain
at
his
post
till
the
day
was
won
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
same

fighting
many
destined
like
rochambeau
himself
to
take
part
in

american

it
was
like
a
preliminary
rehearsal
of
the
drama
that
was
to
be
at
the
second
battle
of
minden
in
where
the
father
of

was
killed
rochambeau
covered

is
not

when
still
very
young

had
contracted
one
of
those
marriages
so
numerous
in
the
eighteenth

in

century
of
which
nothing
is
said

pleasure

lines
written

such
a

i
could
desire

for
me
a

constant
happiness

i
hope
on

side
to
have
made
her
happy

tenderest
amity

has
never

sixty

the
chief
data
thus
secured
he
also
addressed
to
himself
as
a
reminder
a
number
of
useful
recommendations
such
as
these
to
take
with
us
a
quantity
of
flints
much
flour
and
biscuit
have
bricks
as
ballast
for
the
ships
to
be
used
for
ovens
to
try
to
bring
with
us
all
we
want
and
not
to
have
to
ask
from
the
americans
who
are
themselves
in
want
to
have
a
copy
of
the
atlas
brought
from
philadelphia
by
de
lafayette
to
have
a
portable
like
that
of
handy
for
proclamations
siege
artillery
is
indispensable
some
of
the
notes
are
of
grave
import
and
were
not
lost
sight
of
throughout
the
campaign
nothing
without
naval
supremacy
to
those
intrusted
with
the
care
of
loading
the
vessels
he
recommends
that
all
articles
of
the
same
kind
be
not
placed
on
the
same
ship
so
that
in
case
of
mishap
to
any
ship
the
whole
supply
of
any
kind
of
provisions
be
not
totally
lost
as
to
the
pay
for
himself
and
his
officers
he
writes
to
the
minister
that
he
leaves
that
to
him
neither
i
nor
mine
desire
anything
extravagant
we
should
like
to
be
able
to
go
to
this
war
at
our
own
expense
but
the
government
did
not
want
him
to
be
hampered
by
any
lack
of
funds
and
allotted
him
the
then
considerable
sum
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
month
and
four
thousand
a
month
the
generals
under
him
at
brest
where
he
now
repaired
rochambeau
found
that
the
ships
were
not
so
numerous
as
expected
so
that
only
the
first
division
of
his
army
could
embark
under
admiral
chevalier
de
ternay
a
sad
blow
for
the
he
prescribed
that
care
be
at
least
taken
to
select
for
the
passage
the
most
robust
men
and
in
order
to
save
space
that
all
horses
be
left
behind
himself
giving
the
example
i
have
rochambeau
writes
to
prince
de
montbarey
the
minister
of
war
to
part
company
with
two
that
i
can
never
replace
i
do
so
with
the
greatest
sorrow
but
i
do
not
want
to
have
to
reproach
myself
with
their
having
taken
up
the
room
of
twenty
men
who
could
have
embarked
in
their
stead
officers
soldiers
ammunition
artillery
spare
clothing
for
the
troops
and
even
the
go
on
board
at
last
men
and
things
are
but
end
by
shaking
down
into
place
all
will
go
well
rochambeau
writes
to
the
minister
without
any
overcrowding
of
the
troops
the
rule
for
long
journeys
having
been
observed
namely
one
soldier
for
every
two
tons
burden
when
all
were
there
however
forming
a
total
of
men
the
maximum
was
so
truly
reached
that
a
number
of
young
men
some
belonging
to
the
french
families
who
were
arriving
at
brest
from
day
to
day
in
the
hope
of
being
added
to
the
expedition
had
to
be
sent
back
the
fleet
was
already
on
the
high
seas
when
a
cutter
brought
the
government
last
instructions
to
rochambeau
on
the
boat
were
two
brothers
called
berthier
who
besought
to
be
allowed
to
volunteer
they
have
joined
us
yesterday
the
general
writes
to
the
minister
and
have
handed
us
your
letters
they
were
dressed
in
linen
vests
and
breeches
asking
to
be
admitted
as
mere
sailors
but
there
was
really
no
place
to
put
them
those
poor
young
men
are
interesting
and
in
despair
they
had
nevertheless
to
be
sent
back
but
managed
to
join
the
army
later
and
so
it
was
that
alexander
berthier
began
in
the
yorktown
campaign
a
military
career
which
he
was
to
end
as
marshal
of
france
and
prince
of
wagram
and
neufchâtel
the
departure
which
it
was
necessary
to
hasten
while
the
english
were
not
yet
ready
was
beset
with
difficulties
tempests
contrary
winds
and
other
mishaps
had
caused
vexatious
delay
the
de
and
the
had
come
into
collision
and
had
had
to
be
repaired
luckily
wrote
rochambeau
to
montbarey
with
his
usual
good
humor
it
rains
also
on
portsmouth
at
last
on
the
of
may
the
fleet
of
seven
ships
of
the
line
and
two
frigates
conveying
transports
weighed
anchor
for
good
we
shall
have
the
start
of
graves
the
general
wrote
again
for
he
will
have
to
use
the
same
wind
to
leave
portsmouth
and
he
added
with
a
touch
of
emotion
at
this
solemn
moment
i
recommend
this
expedition
to
the
friendship
of
my
dear
old
comrade
and
to
his
zeal
for
the
good
of
the
state
at
sea
now
for
a
long
voyage
two
or
three
months
perhaps
with
the
prospect
of
calms
of
storms
of
untoward
encounters
of
scurvy
for
the
troops
on
board
the
big
de
of
eighty
guns
with
admiral
de
ternay
rochambeau
adds
now
and
then
paragraphs
to
a
long
report
which
is
a
kind
of
journal
assuring
the
minister
after
the
first
fortnight
that
all
is
well
on
board
we
have
no
men
sick
other
than
those
which
the
sea
makes
so
among
whom
the
marquis
de
laval
and
my
son
play
the
most
conspicuous
part
he
prepares
his
general
instructions
to
the
troops
on
board
the
smaller
craft
life
was
harder
and
numerous
unflattering
descriptions
have
come
down
to
us
in
the
journals
kept
by
so
many
officers
of
the
army
especially
in
that
of
the
aforementioned
young
captain
louis
baron
de
closen
later
one
of
the
aides
of
rochambeau
he
confesses
but
with
no
undue
sentimentalism
that
he
was
saddened
at
first
to
some
extent
at
the
prospect
of
an
absence
that
might
be
a
long
one
particularly
when
thinking
of
a
charming
young
fiancée
full
of
wit
and
grace
my
profession
however
does
not
allow
me
to
yield
too
much
to
sensibility
so
i
am
now
perfectly
resigned
he
was
assigned
to
the
de
of
three
hundred
tons
the
that
kept
her
company
was
of
only
one
hundred
and
eighty
each
officer
had
received
fifty
francs
for
extra
purchases
they
found
it
was
little
but
when
they
had
made
their
purchases
they
found
that
it
had
been
much
so
great
was
the
difficulty
in
stowing
their
possessions
on
the
ship
at
last
after
much
trouble
and
many
words
a
few
crowns
here
and
there
each
of
us
succeeded
in
squeezing
himself
and
his
belongings
in
those
closen
for
his
part
had
provisioned
himself
with
sugar
lemons
and
syrups
in
quantity
the
crew
consisted
of
men
half
of
them
bretons
half
provençals
speaking
their
own
dialect
and
who
little
accustomed
to
the
language
used
by
their
naval
officers
when
giving
their
orders
were
apt
to
misunderstand
them
hence
the
bad
manœuvring
which
sent
the
de
right
across
the
a
sad
case
would
they
be
left
behind
and
miss
taking
part
in
the
expedition
by
great
luck
there
were
but
the
bowsprit
the
spritsails
and
the
figure
of
the
charming
countess
which
were
broken
to
pieces
repairs
are
begun
with
all
speed
de
promises
fifteen
louis
to
the
workmen
if
the
ship
is
ready
the
next
day
at
noon
one
more
reassuring
circumstance
was
that
de
kersabiec
a
very
expert
naval
officer
was
intrusted
with
the
care
of
looking
after
the
workmen
he
never
left
them
and
encouraged
them
by
extra
distributions
i
was
intimate
with
all
the
family
having
spent
the
winter
at
the
souvenir
of
which
still
gives
me
pleasure
the
next
day
all
was
right
once
more
after
eleven
the
amiable
countess
was
taken
again
with
no
head
it
is
true
like
so
many
other
countesses
beyond
the
harbor
chain
it
was
possible
to
start
with
the
rest
of
the
fleet
the
high
fortifications
overlooking
the
harbor
the
villages
along
the
coast
so
many
sails
curved
by
a
wind
the
clear
sky
all
united
to
form
the
most
beautiful
picture
at
the
time
of
our
start
so
many
vessels
under
way
offered
a
truly
imposing
sight
life
now
begins
on
the
small
craft
it
is
hard
at
first
to
get
accustomed
so
is
the
ship
but
one
gets
inured
to
it
in
spite
of
the
buzzing
of
so
numerous
a
company
of
the
lack
of
and
of
what
people
breathe
being
made
unpleasant
by
all
sorts
of
exhalations
from
the
ship
the
masses
of
humanity
on
board
and
a
few
dogs
closen
has
the
good
luck
not
to
be
inconvenienced
by
the
sea
settles
in
his
corner
and
from
that
moment
till
the
end
takes
pleasure
in
watching
life
around
him
he
learns
how
to
make
nautical
observations
describes
his
companions
in
his
journal
and
especially
the
captain
a
typical
old
tar
who
has
an
equal
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
hymns
and
of
oaths
prayer
is
said
twice
a
day
on
the
deck
which
does
not
prevent
there
being
much
irreligion
among
seamen
i
have
often
heard
our
captain
swear
and
curse
and
freely
use
the
worst
sailors
language
while
he
was
praying
and
chanting
je
mets
ma
confiance
vierge
en
votre
secours
et
quand
ma
dernière
heure
viendra
guidez
mon
sort
obtenez
que
je
meure
de
la
plus
sainte
mort
various
incidents
break
the
monotony
of
the
journey
on
the
of
june
the
captures
an
english
corsair
which
is
a
joy
but
they
learn
from
her
the
fall
of
charleston
and
the
surrender
of
lincoln
which
gives
food
for
thought
nothing
better
shows
the
difference
between
and
navigation
than
the
small
fact
that
while
on
the
way
they
indulge
in
fishing
on
board
the
de
they
capture
which
are
very
tender
and
delicious
to
eat
fried
in
fresh
butter
like
gudgeons
an
occasion
offers
to
open
fight
with
the
advantage
of
numerical
superiority
on
six
english
vessels
some
shots
are
exchanged
but
with
great
wisdom
and
in
spite
of
the
grumblings
of
all
his
people
ternay
refuses
to
really
engage
them
and
continues
his
voyage
he
had
his
convoy
too
much
at
heart
says
closen
and
he
knew
too
well
the
importance
of
our
expedition
his
positive
orders
being
that
he
must
make
our
army
arrive
quickly
as
for
him
not
to
set
aside
all
the
entreaties
of
the
young
naval
officers
who
i
was
told
were
very
outspoken
on
that
score
as
well
as
most
of
the
land
officers
who
know
nothing
of
naval
matters
the
event
fully
justified
ternay
for
graves
whose
mission
it
had
been
to
intercept
him
and
his
slow
and
heavy
convoy
missed
his
opportunity
by
hours
only
reaching
new
york
where
he
joined
forces
with
arbuthnot
just
as
our
own
ships
were
safe
at
newport
the
slightest
delay
on
ternay
part
might
have
been
fatal
the
more
so
since
when
nearing
the
coast
our
fleet
had
fallen
into
fogs
nothing
so
sad
and
dangerous
at
sea
as
fogs
closen
sententiously
writes
besides
the
difficulty
of
avoiding
collisions
in
so
numerous
a
fleet
each
vessel
in
order
to
shun
them
tries
to
gain
space
thus
one
may
chance
to
get
too
far
from
the
centre
the
standing
orders
for
our
convoy
were
in
view
of
avoiding
those
inconveniences
to
beat
the
drums
every
quarter
of
an
hour
or
fire
petards
the
fired
their
guns
or
sent
rockets
the
was
three
knots
during
the
fog
so
that
each
vessel
might
as
far
as
possible
continue
keeping
company
with
its
neighbor
in
spite
of
all
which
the
de
was
lost
and
there
was
great
anxiety
she
was
not
seen
again
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
but
she
appeared
later
quite
safe
at
boston
the
landing
orders
of
rochambeau
making
known
now
to
all
concerned
the
intentions
of
the
government
were
clear
and
peremptory
drawn
up
by
him
on
board
the
de
he
had
caused
copies
to
be
carried
to
the
chiefs
of
the
several
corps
on
board
the
other
ships
the
troops
which
his
majesty
is
sending
to
america
are
auxiliary
to
those
of
the
united
states
his
allies
and
placed
under
the
orders
of
general
washington
to
whom
the
honors
of
a
marshal
of
france
will
be
rendered
the
same
with
the
president
of
congress
which
avoided
the
possibility
of
any
trouble
as
to
precedence
no
one
in
the
french
army
having
such
a
rank
in
case
of
an
equality
of
rank
and
duration
of
service
the
american
officer
will
take
command
the
troops
of
the
king
will
yield
the
right
side
to
the
allies
french
troops
will
add
black
to
their
cockades
black
being
the
color
of
the
united
states
and
some
such
hats
with
black
and
white
cockades
are
still
preserved
at
fraunces
tavern
new
york
the
intention
of
his
majesty
the
general
continues
is
that
there
be
perfect
concert
and
harmony
between
the
generals
and
officers
of
the
two
nations
the
severest
discipline
will
be
observed
it
is
forbidden
to
take
a
bit
of
wood
a
sheaf
of
straw
any
kind
of
vegetables
except
amicably
and
in
paying
all
faults
of
unruliness
disobedience
insubordination
brutal
and
sonorous
drunkenness
will
be
punished
according
to
ordinances
with
strokes
of
the
flat
of
the
sword
even
light
faults
of
lack
of
cleanliness
or
attention
will
be
punished
to
make
the
punishment
the
harder
for
the
french
soldier
he
will
be
barred
from
military
service
during
his
detention
the
army
but
not
the
fleet
had
been
placed
under
the
orders
of
washington
ternay
instructions
specified
however
that
while
his
squadron
had
no
other
commander
than
himself
it
was
expected
that
he
would
proffer
all
assistance
that
might
facilitate
the
operations
of
the
united
states
and
that
he
would
allow
the
use
of
our
ships
on
every
occasion
when
their
help
might
be
requested
was
obviously
the
leading
sentiment
and
the
desire
of
all
was
to
give
as
little
trouble
and
bring
as
much
useful
help
as
possible
iii
on
the
day
of
july
the
fleet
reached
newport
after
seventy
days
at
sea
which
was
longer
than
columbus
had
taken
on
his
first
voyage
but
which
was
nothing
extraordinary
abbé
robin
a
chaplain
of
the
army
arrived
later
after
a
journey
of
days
none
the
less
filled
with
admiration
for
those
enormous
machines
with
which
men
master
the
waves
a
very
minute
enormity
from
our
modern
point
of
view
there
were
among
the
land
troops
says
closen
endless
shouts
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
being
on
terra
firma
again
the
troops
owing
to
their
having
been
fed
on
salt
meat
and
dry
vegetables
with
little
water
to
drink
on
board
the
de
water
had
become
corrupt
it
was
now
and
then
replaced
by
wine
but
that
heats
one
very
much
had
greatly
suffered
scurvy
had
caused
its
usual
ravages
or
soldiers
and
sailors
were
suffering
from
it
some
had
died
they
were
now
confronted
by
the
unknown
what
would
that
unknown
be
rochambeau
had
only
his
first
division
with
him
would
he
be
attacked
at
once
by
the
english
who
disposed
of
superior
naval
and
land
forces
about
new
york
and
what
would
be
the
attitude
of
the
americans
themselves
everybody
was
for
them
in
france
but
few
people
had
a
real
knowledge
of
them
lafayette
had
but
he
was
young
and
enthusiastic
would
the
inhabitants
would
their
leader
washington
would
their
army
answer
his
description
on
the
arrival
of
the
fleet
newport
had
fired
thirteen
grand
rockets
and
illuminated
its
windows
but
that
might
be
a
mere
matter
of
course
of
these
illuminations
the
then
president
of
yale
ezra
stiles
has
left
a
noteworthy
record
the
bell
rang
at
newport
till
after
midnight
and
the
evening
of
the
newport
illuminated
the
whigs
put
thirteen
lights
in
the
windows
the
tories
or
doubtfuls
four
or
six
the
quakers
did
not
choose
their
lights
should
shine
before
men
and
their
windows
were
broken
the
game
was
moreover
a
difficult
one
and
had
to
be
played
on
an
immense
including
north
and
south
boston
new
york
charleston
and
the
chesapeake
including
even
the
isles
that
is
the
west
indies
and
what
took
place
there
which
might
have
so
much
importance
for
continental
operations
had
constantly
to
be
guessed
or
imagined
for
lack
of
news
worse
than
all
the
reputation
of
the
french
was
up
to
then
in
america
such
as
hostile
english
books
and
caricatures
and
inconsiderate
french
ones
had
made
it
we
knew
it
and
so
well
too
that
the
appropriateness
of
having
our
troops
winter
in
our
colonies
of
the
west
indies
was
at
one
time
considered
our
minister
gérard
was
of
that
opinion
the
americans
are
little
accustomed
to
live
with
french
people
for
whom
they
can
not
have
as
yet
a
very
marked
inclination
the
prejudice
kept
up
by
the
english
wrote
in
his
about
the
french
character
was
so
strong
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
the
most
ardent
minds
and
several
among
those
who
most
desired
independence
rejected
the
idea
of
an
alliance
with
france
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
said
abbé
robin
the
idea
americans
entertained
about
the
french
before
the
war
they
considered
them
as
groaning
under
the
yoke
of
despotism
a
prey
to
superstition
and
prejudices
almost
idolatrous
in
their
religion
and
as
a
kind
of
light
brittle
mechanisms
only
busy
frizzling
their
hair
and
painting
their
faces
without
faith
or
morals
how
would
thousands
of
such
mechanisms
be
received
with
his
usual
rochambeau
did
the
necessary
thing
on
each
point
to
begin
with
in
case
of
an
english
attack
which
was
at
first
expected
every
day
he
lost
no
time
in
fortifying
the
position
he
occupied
having
wrote
personally
selected
the
chief
points
to
be
defended
and
having
batteries
of
heavy
artillery
and
mortars
erected
along
the
channel
with
furnaces
to
heat
the
balls
during
the
first
six
days
says
closen
we
were
not
quite
at
our
ease
but
luckily
messieurs
les
anglais
showed
us
great
consideration
and
we
suffered
from
nothing
worse
than
grave
anxieties
after
the
second
week
rochambeau
could
write
home
that
if
clinton
appeared
he
would
be
well
received
shortly
after
he
feels
sorry
the
visit
is
delayed
later
when
his
own
second
division
so
ardently
desired
did
not
appear
he
writes
to
the
war
minister
in
two
words
sir
henry
clinton
and
i
are
very
punctilious
and
the
question
is
between
us
who
will
first
call
on
the
other
if
we
do
not
get
up
earlier
in
the
morning
than
the
english
and
the
reinforcements
they
expect
from
europe
reach
them
before
our
second
division
arrives
they
will
pay
us
a
visit
here
that
i
should
prefer
to
pay
them
in
new
york
concerning
the
reputation
of
the
french
rochambeau
and
his
officers
were
in
perfect
accord
it
would
change
if
exemplary
discipline
were
maintained
throughout
the
campaign
there
is
nothing
the
chief
paid
more
attention
to
than
this
nor
with
more
complete
success
writing
to
prince
de
montbarey
a
month
after
the
landing
rochambeau
says
i
can
answer
for
the
discipline
of
the
army
not
a
man
has
left
his
camp
not
a
cabbage
has
been
stolen
not
a
complaint
has
been
heard
to
the
president
of
congress
he
had
written
a
few
days
before
i
hope
that
account
will
have
been
rendered
to
your
excellency
of
the
discipline
observed
by
the
french
troops
there
has
not
been
one
complaint
not
a
man
has
missed
a
we
are
your
brothers
and
we
shall
act
as
such
with
you
we
shall
fight
your
enemies
by
your
side
as
if
we
were
one
and
the
same
nation
mentioning
in
his
memoirs
the
visit
of
those
savages
who
had
been
formerly
under
french
rule
and
persisted
in
remaining
friendly
to
us
he
adds
the
sight
of
guns
troops
and
military
exercises
caused
them
no
surprise
but
they
were
greatly
astonished
to
see
with
their
apples
upon
them
overhanging
the
soldiers
tents
this
result
he
concludes
was
due
not
only
to
the
zeal
of
officers
but
more
than
anything
else
to
the
good
disposition
of
the
soldiers
which
never
failed
another
fact
which
proved
to
our
advantage
was
that
the
french
could
then
be
seen
in
numbers
and
at
close
quarters
the
difference
between
the
portrait
and
the
original
was
too
glaring
to
escape
notice
william
channing
father
of
the
philanthropist
confides
to
the
same
ezra
stiles
in
a
letter
of
august
his
delighted
surprise
the
french
are
a
fine
body
of
men
and
appear
to
be
well
officered
neither
the
officers
nor
men
are
the
effeminate
beings
we
were
heretofore
taught
to
believe
them
they
are
as
large
and
likely
men
as
can
be
produced
by
any
nation
so
much
for
the
brittle
mechanisms

the
french
officers

most
of

former
companions
in
arms
and
personal
friends
rochambeau
as
soon
as
he
had
landed
began
to
correspond
the
letters
thus
exchanged
generally
unpublished
give
a
vivid
picture
of
the
life
then
led
in
the
isles
cut
off
from
the
world
most
of
the
time
not
knowing
what
was
taking
place
in
france
in
america
on
the
sea
or
even
sometimes
on
the
neighboring
island
unaware
of
the
whereabouts
of
rodney
having
to
guess
which
place
he
might
try
to
storm
and
which
they
should
therefore
garrison
these
men
suffering
from
fevers
having
now
and
then
their
ships
scattered
by
cyclones
played
to
their
credit
and
with
perfect
good
humor
their
difficult
game
of
hide
and
seek
they

their
letters
in
duplicate
and

of

that
their

of
october
have
been
duly
received
by
rochambeau
in
june
the
marquis
de
bouillé
who
was
to
cover
himself
with
glory
at
brimstone
hill
and
is
now
chiefly
remembered
for
the
part
he
played
in

to
varennes
writes
most
affectionately
and
does
not
forget
to
convey
the
compliments
of
his
brave
wife
who
had
accompanied
him
to
martinique
the
marquis
de
writes
from
santo
domingo
to
say
how
much
he
would
like
to
go
and
fight
under
rochambeau
on
the
continent
i
would
be
delighted
to
be
under
your
orders
and
to
give
up
for
that
the
command
in
chief
i
enjoy
here
and
he
supplies
him
in
the
same
unpublished
letter
with
a
most
interesting
account
of
cuba
just
visited
by
him
this
colony
has
an
air
of
importance
far
superior
to
any
of
ours
inhabited
as
it
is
by
all
the
owners
of
the
land
so
that
the
city
havana
looks
rather
a
european
than
a
colonial
one
society
is
numerous
and
seems
opulent
if
spain
would
extend
and
facilitate
the
trade
of
cuba
the
island
would
become
exceedingly
rich
in
little
time
but
prohibitory
laws
are
so
harsh
and
penalties
so
rigorous
that
they
cramp
industry
everywhere
a
postscript
in
the
same
letter
shows
better
than
anything
else
what
was
the
common
feeling
among
officers
toward
rochambeau
montbrun
writes
who
has
been
suffering
from
the
fever
for
a
long
time
asks
me
to
assure
you
of
his
respectful
attachment
and
says
that
he
has
written
you
twice
that
your
silence
afflicts
him
very
much
and
that
a
token
of
friendship
and
remembrance
from
you
would
be
for
him
the
best
of
febrifuges
all
your
former
subordinates
of
auvergne
think
the
same
and
have
the
same
attachment
for
you
in
which
respect
i
yield
to
none
the
stanch
devotion
of
rochambeau
to
his
duties
as
a
soldier
his
personal
disinterestedness
his
and
energy
as
a
leader
his
good
humor
in
the
midst
of
troubles
had
secured
for
him
the
devotion
of
many
while
his
brusquery
his
peremptoriness
the
severity
which
veiled
his
real
warmth
of
heart
whenever
the
service
was
at
stake
won
him
a
goodly
number
of
enemies
the
latter
very
generally
of
less
worth
as
men
than
the
former
in
the
affectionate
letter
by
which
he
made
up
early
differences
with
his
son
lafayette
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
observes
concerning
his
own
military
career
if
i
have
been
lucky
enough
to
preserve
up
to
now
the
confidence
of
the
french
soldiers
the
reason
is
that
out
of
men
or
thereabout
who
have
been
killed
or
wounded
under
my
orders
of
different
rank
and
in
the
most
deadly
actions
i
have
not
to
reproach
myself
with
having
caused
a
single
one
to
be
killed
for
the
sake
of
my
own
fame
he
seemed
ségur
said
in
his
memoirs
to
have
been
purposely
created
to
understand
washington
and
be
understood
by
him
and
to
serve
with
republicans
a
friend
of
order
of
laws
and
of
liberty
his
example
more
even
than
his
authority
obliged
us
scrupulously
to
respect
the
rights
properties
and
customs
of
our
allies
iv
nothing
without
my
second
division
rochambeau
thought
he
had
urged
the
government
in
his
last
letters
before
leaving
france
to
send
it
not
later
than
a
fortnight
after
he
himself
had
sailed
the
convoy
will
cross
much
more
safely
now
under
the
guard
of
two
warships
he
had
written
to
montbarey
than
it
will
in
a
month
with
an
escort
of
thirty
when
the
english
are
ready
and
again
after
having
embarked
on
the
de
for
heaven
sake
sir
hasten
that
second
division
we
are
just
now
weighing
anchor
but
weeks
and
months
went
by
and
no
news
came
of
the
second
division
washington
with
his
ardent
patriotism
lafayette
with
his
youthful
enthusiasm
were
pressing
rochambeau
to
risk
all
in
order
to
capture
new
york
the
stronghold
of
the
enemy
and
chief
centre
of
their
power
i
am
confident
rochambeau
answered
that
our
general
washington
does
not
want
us
to
give
here
a
second
edition
of
savannah
and
he
felt
the
more
anxious
that
with
the
coming
of
recruits
and
going
of
veterans
and
the
enlistments
washington
would
command
now
men
now
rochambeau
decided
in
october
to
send
to
france
his
son
then
colonel
of
the
regiment
of
bourbonnais
to
remonstrate
as
capture
was
possible
and
the
envoy
might
have
to
throw
his
despatches
overboard
young
rochambeau
being
blessed
with
youth
and
a
good
memory
had
learned
their
contents
by
heart
one
of
the
best
sailors
of
the
fleet
had
been
selected
to
convey
him
on
the
frigate
on
account
of
superior
forces
mounting
guard
outside
the
captain
waited
for
the
first
night
storm
that
should
arise
when
the
watch
was
sure
to
be
less
strict
started
in
the
midst
of
one
after
having
waited
for
eight
days
was
recognized
but
too
late
was
chased
had
his
masts
broken
repaired
them
and
reached
brest
safely
the
sailor
who
did
so
well
on
this
occasion
and
who
was
to
meet
a
tragical
death
at
vanikoro
bore
the
name
famous
since
of
la
pérouse
time
wore
on
a
sad
time
for
the
american
cause
one
day
the
news
was
that
one
of
the
most
trusted
generals
famous
for
his
services
on
land
and
water
benedict
arnold
had
turned
traitor
another
day
that
gates
had
been
routed
at
camden
and
kalb
killed
in
december
ternay
died
in
january
worse
than
all
the
soldiers
of
the
pennsylvania
line
mutinied
unpaid
underfed

under
the
flag
long
after
the
time
for
which
they
had
enlisted
they
went
closen
writes
in
his
journal
to
extremities
in
europe
they
would
not
have
waited
so
long
there
was
no
doubt
in
fact
that
the
life
they
had
to
lead
did
not
closely
resemble
that
which
in
accordance
with
the
uses
then
prevailing
in
every
country
the
posters
urging
enlistment
depicted
to
them
one
such
poster
preserved
in
philadelphia
announces
to
all
brave
healthy
and
young
men
in
this
neighborhood
who
have
any
inclination
to
join
the
troops
now
raising
under
general
washington
for
the
defense
of
the
liberties
and
independence
of
the
united
states
a
truly
liberal
and
generous
encouragement
namely
a
bounty
of
twelve
dollars
an
annual
and
fully
sufficient
supply
of
good
and
handsome
clothing
a
daily
allowance
of
a
large
and
ample
ration
of
provisions
together
with
sixty
dollars
a
year
in
gold
and
silver
money
on
account
of
pay
the
appeal
vaunted
by
way
of
conclusion
the
great
advantages
which
these
brave
men
will
have
who
shall
embrace
this
opportunity
of
spending
a
few
happy
years
in
viewing
the
different
parts
of
this
beautiful
continent
in
the
honorable
and
truly
respectable
character
of
a
soldier
after
which
he
may
if
he
pleases
return
home
to
his
friends
with
his
pockets
full
of
money
and
his
head
covered
with
laurels
god
save
the
united
states
pretty
engravings
showed
handsome
soldiers
elegantly
dressed
practising
an
easy
kind
of
military
drill
the
danger
was
great
but
brief
tempted
by
the
enemy
to
change
sides
and
receive
full
pay
the
pennsylvania
line
refused
indignantly
we
are
honest
soldiers
asking
justice
from
our
compatriots
they
answered
we
are
not
traitors
on
the
margin
of
a
french
account
of
those
events
published
in
paris
in
clinton
scribbled
a
number
of
observations
hitherto
unprinted
they
are
in
french
or
something
like
it
opposite
this
statement
the
british
general
wrote
bien
dit
et
dommage
pas
we
can
not
tell
but
one
thing
is
sure
namely
that
in
accordance
with
those
words
spoken
or
not
the
rebellious
soldiers
acted
owing
to
washington
influence
order
soon
reigned
again
but
the
alarm
had
been
very
great
as
shown
by
the
instructions
which
he
handed
to
colonel
laurens
now
sent
by
him
to
versailles
with
a
mission
similar
to
that
of
young
rochambeau
the
emotion
caused
by
the
last
events
is
reflected
in
them
the
patience
of
the
american
army
is
almost
exhausted
the
great
majority
of
the
inhabitants
is
still
firmly
attached
to
the
cause
of
independence
but
that
cause
may
be
wrecked
if
more
money
more
men
and
more
ships
are
not
immediately
supplied
by
the
french
ally
while
the
presence
of
the
american
and
french
troops
in
the
north
kept
clinton
and
his
powerful
new
york
garrison
immobile
where
they
were
the
situation
in
the
south
was
becoming
worse
and
worse
with
cornwallis
at
the
head
of
superior
forces
lord
rawdon
holding
charleston
and
the
hated
arnold
ravaging
virginia
against
them
the
american
forces
under
greene
lafayette
and
morgan
who
had
partly
destroyed
tarleton
cavalry
at
cowpens
january
were
doing
their
utmost
facing
fearful
odds
with
a
handful
of
men
knowing
that
the
slightest
error
might
be
his
destruction
young
lafayette
aged
far
from
help
and
advice
was
conducting
a
campaign
in
which
his
pluck
wisdom
and
tenacity
won
him
the
admiration
of
veterans
irritated
ever
to
find
him
on
his
path
cornwallis
was
writing
a
little
later
to
clinton
if
i
can
get
an
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
at
him
without
loss
of
time
i
will
certainly
try
it
but
lafayette
would
not
let
his
adversary
thus
employ
his
leisure
to
arrest
the
progress
of
arnold
two
french
expeditions
were
sent
taking
advantage
of
moments
when
access
to
the
sea
was
not
blocked
by
the
english
fleet
before
newport
one
in
february
under
tilly
who
pursued
arnold
convoy
up
the
elizabeth
river
as
high
as
the
draft
of
his
ships
permitted
but
had
to
stop
and
come
home
having
only
captured
the
of
guns
some
smaller
ships
a
quantity
of
supplies
destined
for
arnold
and
made
prisoners
another
of
more
importance
under
the
chevalier
destouches
in
march
with
part
of
rochambeau
army
on
board
in
case
a
landing
were
possible
in
spite
of
all
precautions
destouches
intentions
were
discovered
the
english
fleet
engaged
ours
the
fight
in
which
french
lost
their
lives
and
were
wounded
was
a
creditable
one
and
might
easily
have
ended
in
disaster
for
the
enemy
had
more
guns
and
several
of
our
ships
on
account
of
their
not
being
were
slow
but
clever
manœuvring
however
compensated
those
defects
congress
voted
thanks
but
the
situation
remained
the
same
and
now
closen
noted
down
in
his
journal
we
have
arnold
free
to
act
as
he
pleases
virginia
desolated
by
his
incursions
and
de
lafayette
too
weak
to
do
anything
but
keep
on
the
defensive
v
one
day
however
something
would
have
to
be
done
and
in
order
to
be
ready
rochambeau
kept
his
army
busy
with
manœuvres
military
exercises
sham
warfare
le
simulacre
de
la
petite
guerre
and
the
building
of
fortifications
as
for
his
officers
he
encouraged
them
to
travel
for
a
large
part
of
the
land
was
free
of
enemies
and
to
become
better
acquainted
with
these
american
brothers
whom
they
had
come
to
fight
for
french
officers
were
thus
seen
at
boston
albany
west
point
philadelphia
it
was
at
this
period
that
chastellux
went
about
the
country
with
some
of
his
companions
and
gathered
the
material
for
his
dans
du
the
first
edition
of
which
in
a
much
abbreviated
form
was
issued
by
that
of
the
fleet
which
rochambeau
had
recommended
to
himself
not
to
forget
de
royale
de
one
reads
on
the
only
copies
were
struck
off
the
imprimerie
royale
of
the
fleet
had
obviously
no
superabundance
of
type
nor
of
paper
closen
who
to
his
joy
and
surprise
had
been
made
a
member
of
rochambeau
family
that
is
had
been
appointed
one
of
his
aides
as
soon
as
his
new
duties
left
him
some
leisure
began
with
his
methodical
mind
to
study
he
tells
us
the
constitution
of
the
thirteen
states
and
of
the
congress
of
america
meaning
of
course
at
that
date
their
several
constitutions
which
organization
as
time
has
shown
is
well
adapted
to
the
national
character
and
has
made
the
happiness
of
that
people
so
respectable
from
every
point
of
view
he
began
after
this
to
examine
the
products
of
the
soil
of
rhode
island
perhaps
one
of
the
prettiest
islands
on
the
globe
the
stay
being
prolonged
the
officers
began
to
make
acquaintances
to
learn
english
to
gain
access
to
american
society
it
was
at
first
very
difficult
neither
french
nor
american
understood
each
other
language
so
recourse
was
bravely
had
to
latin
better
known
then
than
de

a
long

sublieutenant

announced
however
his
intention
to
learn
english
during
the
winter
season
linguam

his
letters
of
an
afterdate
are
in
fact
written
in
english
but
a
beginner
english
for
the
use
of
latin
the
of
the
french
army
was
able
to
set
the
example
and
ezra
stiles
could
talk
at
a
dinner
in
that
language
with
rochambeau
still
reminiscent
of
what
he
had
learned
when
studying
for
priesthood
the
president
of
yale
notes
in
his
journal
october
introduced
to
the
of
the
french
allied
army
the
count
de
rochambeau
dined
at
the
general
de
rochambeau
in
a
splendid
manner
there
were
perhaps
thirty
at
table
i
conversed
with
the
general
in
latin
he
speaks
it
tolerably
beginning
to
know
something
of
the
language
our
officers
risk
paying
visits
and
go
to
teas
and
dinners
closen
notes
with
curiosity
all
he
sees
it
is
good
behavior
each
time
people
meet
to
accost
each
other
mutually
offering
the
hand
and
shaking
it
english
fashion
arriving
in
a
company
of
men
one
thus
goes
around
but
must
remember
that
it
belongs
to
the
one
of
higher
rank
to
extend
his
hand
first
unspeakable
quantities
of
tea
are
drunk
to
crave
mercy
when
one
has
taken
half
a
dozen
cups
one
must
put
the
spoon
across
the
cup
for
so
long
as
you
do
not
place
it
so
your
cup
is
always
taken
rinsed
filled
again
and
placed
before
you
after
the
first
the
custom
is
for
the
pretty
pourer
most
of
them
are
so
to
ask
you
the
tea
suitable
an
insipid
drink
grumbles
chaplain
robin
over
whom
the
prettiness
of
the
pourers
was
powerless
the
toasts
are
also
a
very
surprising
custom
sometimes
an
uncomfortable
one
one
is
terribly
fatigued
by
the
quantity
of
healths
which
are
being
drunk
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
a
gentleman
pledges
you
sometimes
with
only
a
glance
which
means
that
you
should
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
a
compliment
which
can
not
be
politely
ignored
in
the
course
of
an
excursion
to
boston
the
young
captain
visits
an
assembly
of
quakers
where
unluckily
no
one
was
inspired
and
ennui
seemed
consequently
to
reign
but
what
strikes
him
more
than
anything
else
is
the
beauty
of
those
young
ladies
who
made
him
drink
so
much
tea
nature
has
endowed
the
ladies
of
rhode
island
with
the
handsomest
finest
features
one
can
imagine
their
complexion
is
clear
and
white
their
hands
and
feet
usually
small
but
let
not
the
ladies
of
other
states
be
tempted
to
resent
this
preference
one
sees
later
that
in
each
city
he
visits
young
closen
is
similarly
struck
and
that
more
considerate
than
the
shepherd
paris
he
somehow
manages
to
refuse
the
apple
to
none
on
the
boston
ladies
he
is
quite
enthusiastic
on
the
philadelphia
ones
not
less
he
finds
however
the
latter
a
little
too
serious
which
he
attributes
to
the
presence
of
congress
in
that
city
but
above
all
the
object
of
my
compatriots
curiosity
was
the
great
man
the
one
of
whom
they
had
heard
so
much
on
the
other
side
the
personification
of
the
ideas
of
liberty
and
popular
government
george
washington
all
wanted
to
see
him
and
as
soon
as
permission
to
travel
was
granted
several
managed
to
reach
his
camp
for
all
of
them
different
as
they
might
be
in
rank
and
character
the
impression
was
the
same
and
fulfilled
expectation
beginning
with
rochambeau
who
saw
him
for
the
first
time
at
the
hartford
conferences
in
september
when
they
tried
to
draw
a
first
plan
for
a
combined
action
a
friendship
then
commenced
between
the
two
that
was
long
to
survive
those
eventful
years
from
the
moment
we
began
to
correspond
with
one
another
rochambeau
wrote
in
his
memoirs
i
never
ceased
to
enjoy
the
soundness
of
his
judgment
and
the
amenity
of
his
style
in
a
very
long
correspondence
which
is
likely
not
to
end
before
the
death
of
one
of
us
chastellux
who
saw
him
at
his
camp
where
the
band
of
the
american
army
played
for
him
the
march
of
the
huron
could
draw
from
life
his
description
of
him
ending
northern
america
from
boston
to
charleston
is
a
great
book
every
page
of
which
tells
his
praise
count
de
ségur
says
that
he
apprehended
his
expectations
could
not
be
equalled
by
reality
but
they
were
his
exterior
almost
told
his
story
simplicity
grandeur
dignity
calm
kindness
firmness
shone
in
his
physiognomy
as
well
as
in
his
character
he
was
of
a
noble
and
high
stature
his
expression
was
gentle
and
kindly
his
smile
pleasing
his
manners
simple
without
familiarity
all
in
him
announced
the
hero
of
a
republic
i
have
seen
washington
says
abbé
robin
the
soul
and
support
of
one
of
the
greatest
revolutions
that
ever
happened
in
a
country
where
every
individual
has
a
part
in
supreme
authority
he
has
been
able
to
maintain
his
troops
in
absolute
subordination
render
them
jealous
of
his
praise
make
them
fear
his
very
silence
closen
was
one
day
sent
with
despatches
to
the
great
man
and
like
all
the
others
began
to
worship
him
as
a
consequence
of
this
mission
washington
came
on
the
of
march
to
visit
the
french
camp
and
fleet
he
was
received
with
the
honors
due
to
a
marshal
of
france
the
ships
were
dressed
the
troops
in
their
best
uniforms
dans
la
plus
grande
tenue
lined
the
streets
from
rochambeau
house
the
fine
vernon
house
still
in
existence
to
the
harbor
the
roar
and
smoke
of
the
guns
rose
in
honor
of
the
hero
of
liberty
washington
saw
destouches
fleet
sail
for
its
southern
expedition
and
wished
it
godspeed
and
after
a
six
days
stay
enlivened
by
illuminations
dinners
and
balls
he
left
on
the
i
can
say
we
read
in
closen
journal
that
he
carried
away
with
him
the
regrets
the
attachment
the
respect
and
the
veneration
of
all
our
army
summing
up
his
impression
he
adds
all
in
him
betokens
a
great
man
with
an
excellent
heart
enough
good
will
never
be
said
of
him
vi
on
the
of
may
the
arrived
at
boston
having
on
board
count
de
barras
a
commodore
with
the
red
ribbon
of
the
same
family
as
the
future
member
of
the
directoire
and
who
was
to
replace
ternay
with
him
was
viscount
rochambeau
bringing
to
his
father
the
unwelcome
news
that
no
second
division
was
to
be
expected
my
son
has
returned
very
solitary
was
the
only
remonstrance
the
general
sent
to
the
minister
but
the
young
colonel
was
able
to
give
at
the
same
time
news
of
great
importance
a
new
fleet
under
count
de
grasse
had
been
got
together
and
at
the
time
of
the
departure
had
just
sailed
for
the
west
indies
so
that
a
temporary
domination
of
the
sea
might
become
a
possibility
nothing
without
naval
supremacy
rochambeau
had
written
as
we
know
in
his
before
starting
in
spite
moreover
of
hard
times
wrote
vergennes
to
la
luzerne
and
of
the
already
disquieting
state
of
our
finances
a
new
gratuitous
subsidy
of
six
million
livres
tournois
was
granted
to
the
americans
some
funds
had
already
been
sent
to
rochambeau
one
million
and
a
half
in
february
with
a
letter
of
necker
saying
be
assured
sir
that
all
that
will
be
asked
from
the
finance
department
for
your
army
will
be
made
ready
on
the
instant
seven
millions
arrived
a
little
later
brought
by
the
which
had
crossed
the
ocean
in
days
without
mishap
as
for
troops
only
recruits
arrived
at
boston
in
june
with
the
since
nothing
more
was
to
be
expected
the
hour
had
come
for
definitive
decisions
a
great
effort
must
now
be
made
great
effort
in
view
of
which
all
the
rest
had
been
done
the
one
which
might
bring
about
peace
and
american
liberty
or
end
in
lasting
failure
all
felt
the
importance
and
solemnity
of
the
hour
the
great
question
was
what
should
be
attempted
the
storming
of
new
york
or
the
relief
of
the
south
the
terms
of
the
problem
had
been
amply
discussed
in
letters
and
conferences
between
the
chiefs
and
the
discussion
still
continued
the
one
who
first
made
up
his
mind
and
ceased
to
hesitate
between
the
respective
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
the
two
projects
and
who
plainly
declared
that
there
was
but
one
good
plan
which
was
to
reconquer
the
south
that
one
strange
to
say
was
neither
washington
nor
rochambeau
and
was
not
in
the
united
states
either
as
a
sailor
or
a
soldier
but
as
a
diplomat
and
in
drawing
attention
to
the
fact
i
am
only
performing
the
most
agreeable
duty
toward
a
justly
admired
predecessor
this
wise
adviser
was
la
luzerne
in
an
unpublished
memoir
drawn
up
by
him
on
the
of
april
and
sent
to
rochambeau
on
may
with
an
explanatory
letter
in
which
he
asked
that
his
statement
a
copy
of
which
he
also
sent
to
barras
be
placed
under
the
eyes
of
washington
he
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
immediate
action
and
action
in
the
chesapeake
it
is
in
the
chesapeake
bay
that
it
seems
urgent
to
convey
all
the
naval
forces
of
the
king
with
such
land
forces
as
the
generals
will
consider
appropriate
this
change
can
not
fail
to
have
the
most
advantageous
consequences
for
the
continuation
of
the
campaign
which
consequences
he
points
out
with
singular
adding
if
the
english
follow
us
and
can
reach
the
bay
only
after
us
their
situation
will
prove
very
different
from
ours
all
the
coasts
and
the
inland
parts
of
the
country
are
full
of
their
enemies
they
have
neither
the
means
nor
the
time
to
raise
as
at
new
york
the
necessary
works
to
protect
themselves
against
the
inroads
of
the
american
troops
and
to
save
themselves
from
the
danger
to
which
the
arrival
of
superior
forces
would
expose
them
if
the
plan
submitted
by
him
offers
difficulties
others
should
be
formed
but
he
maintains
that
all
those
which
have
for
their
object
the
relief
of
the
southern
states
must
be
preferred
and
that
no
time
should
be
lost
to
put
them
in
execution
at
the
weathersfield
conference
near
hartford
between
the
americans
and
french
on
the
of
may
in
the
webb
house
still
in
existence
washington
still
evinced
and
not
without
some
weighty
reasons
his
preference
for
an
attack
on
new
york
he
spoke
of
the
advanced
season
of
the
great
waste
of
men
which
we
have
found
from
experience
in
long
marches
in
the
southern
states
of
the
difficulty
of
transports
by
land
all
those
reasons
and
some
others
too
well
known
to
count
de
rochambeau
to
need
repeating
show
that
an
operation
against
new
york
should
be
preferred
in
the
present
circumstances
to
the
effort
of
a
sending
of
troops
to
the
south
on
the
same
day
he
was
writing
to
la
luzerne
i
should
be
wanting
in
respect
and
confidence
were
i
not
to
add
that
our
object
is
new
york
la
luzerne
however
kept
on
insisting
to
rochambeau
he
wrote
on
the
of
june
the
situation
of
the
southern
states
becomes
every
moment
more
critical
it
has
even
become
very
dangerous
and
every
measure
that
could
be
taken
for
their
relief
would
be
of
infinite
advantage
the
situation
of
the
marquis
de
lafayette
and
that
of
general
greene
is
most
embarrassing
since
lord
cornwallis
has
joined
the
english
division
of
the
chesapeake
if
virginia
is
not
helped
in
time
the
english
will
have
reached
the
goal
which
they
have
assigned
to
themselves
in
the
bold
movements
attempted
by
them
in
the
south
they
will
soon
have
really
conquered
the
southern
states
i
am
going
to
write
to
de
grasse
as
you
want
me
to
do
on
your
side
seize
every
occasion
to
write
to
him
and
multiply
the
copies
of
the
letters
you
send
him
that
is
in
duplicate
and
triplicate
for
fear
of
loss
or
capture
his
coming
to
the
rescue
of
the
oppressed
states
is
not
simply
desirable
the
thing
seems
to
be
now
of
the
most
pressing
necessity
he
must
not
only
come
but
bring
with
him
all
he
can
find
of
french
troops
in
our
isles
thus
would
be
compensated
to
a
certain
extent
the
absence
of
the
second
division
rochambeau
soon
agreed
and
with
his
usual
wisdom
washington
was
not
long
in
doing
the
same
on
the
of
may
the
french
general
had
already
written
to
de
grasse
beseeching
him
to
come
with
every
means
at
his
disposal
to
bring
his
whole
fleet
and
not
only
his
fleet
but
a
supply
of
money
to
be
borrowed
in
our
colonies
and
also
all
the
french
land
forces
from
our
garrisons
which
he
could
muster
the
desire
of
to
come
and
help
had
of
course
not
been
forgotten
by
rochambeau
and
he
counted
on
his
after
having
described
the
extreme
importance
of
the
effort
to
be
attempted
he
concluded
the
crisis
through
which
america
is
passing
at
this
moment
is
of
the
severest
the
coming
of
count
de
grasse
may
be
salvation
events
had
so
shaped
themselves
that
the
fate
of
the
united
states
and
the
destinies
of
more
than
one
nation
would
be
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
hands
of
one
man
and
one
greatly
hampered
by
imperative
instructions
obliging
him
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
steam
to
command
the
wind
and
waves
to
be
at
a
fixed
date
in
the
west
indies
owing
to
certain
arrangements
with
spain
would
he
take
the
risk
and
what
would
be
the
answer
of
that
temporary
arbiter
of
future
events
françois
joseph
paul
comte
de
grasse
a
sailor
from
the
age
of
twelve
now
a
and
chef
who
had
seen
already
much
service
on
every
sea
in
the
east
and
west
indies
with
at
ushant
with
guichen
against
rodney
in
the
caribbean
sea
a
haughty
man
it
was
said
with
some
friends
and
many
enemies
the
one
quality
of
his
acknowledged
by
friend
and
foe
being
valor
our
admiral
his
sailors
were
wont
to
say
is
six
foot
tall
on
ordinary
days
and
six
foot
six
on
battle
days
what
would
he
do
and
say
people
in
those
times
had
to
take
their
chance
and
act
in
accordance
with
probabilities
this
washington
and
rochambeau
did
by
the
beginning
of
june
all
was
astir
in
the
northern
camp
soldiers
did
not
know
what
was
contemplated
but
obviously
it
was
something
great
young
officers
exulted
what
joy
to
have
at
last
the
prospect
of
an
active
campaign
wrote
closen
in
his
journal
and
to
have
an
occasion
to
visit
other
provinces
and
see
the
differences
in
manners
customs
products
and
trade
of
our
good
americans
the
camp
is
raised
and
the
armies
are
on
the
move
toward
new
york
and
the
south
they
are
in
the
best
dispositions
ready
according
to
circumstances
to
fight
or
admire
all
that
turns
up
the
country
between
providence
and
bristol
says
closen
is
charming
we
thought
we
had
been
transported
into
paradise
all
the
roads
being
lined
with
acacias
in
full
bloom
filling
the
air
with
a
delicious
almost
too
strong
fragrance
steeples
are
climbed
and
the
sight
is
one
of
the
finest
possible
snakes
are
somewhat
troublesome
but
such
things
will
happen
even
in
paradise
the
heat
becomes
very
great
and
night
marches
are
arranged
beginning
at
two
in
the
morning
roads
at
times
become
muddy
paths
where
wagons
artillery
carts
conveying
boats
for
the
crossing
of
rivers
cause
great
trouble
and
delay
poor
abbé
robin
for
martyrdom
becomes
pathetic
talking
of
his
own
fate
fearful
of
being
captured
by
the
english
and
of
becoming
the
victim
of
those
he
sleeps
on
the
ground
under
a
torrential
rain
in
front
of
a
great
fire
roasted
on
one
side
drenched
on
the
other
he
finds
however
that
french
gayety
remains
ever
present
in
these
hard
marches
the
americans
whom
curiosity
brings
by
the
thousand
to
our
camps
are
received
he
writes
with
lively
joy
we
cause
our
military
instruments
to
play
for
them
of
which
they
are
passionately
fond
officers
and
soldiers
then
american
men
and
women
mix
and
dance
together
it
is
the
feast
of
equality
the
of
the
alliance
which
must
prevail
between
those
nations
these
people
are
still
in
the
happy
period
when
distinctions
of
rank
and
birth
are
ignored
they
treat
alike
the
soldier
and
the
officer
and
often
ask
the
latter
what
is
his
profession
in
his
country
unable
as
they
are
to
imagine
that
that
of
a
warrior
may
be
a
fixed
and
permanent
one
washington
writes
to
recommend
precautions
against
spies
who
will
be
sent
to
the
french
camp
dressed
as
peasants
bringing
fruit
and
other
provisions
and
who
will
be
attentive
to
every
word
which
they
may
hear
drop
several
officers
for
the
sake
of
example
discard
their
horses
and
walk
indifferent
to
mud
and
heat
some
of
them
like
the
viscount
de
noailles
performing
on
foot
the
whole
distance
of
seven
hundred
and
miles
between
newport
and
yorktown
cases
of
sickness
were
rare
the
attention
of
the
superior
officers
says
abbé
robin
very
much
contributed
to
this
by
the
care
they
took
in
obliging
the
soldiers
to
drink
no
water
without
rum
in
it
to
remove
its
noisome
qualities
it
is
not
reported
that
superior
officers
had
to
use
violence
to
be
obeyed
this
precaution
up
to
a
recent
date
was
still
considered
a
wise
one
in
the
long
journeys
on
foot
that
we
used
to
take
in
my
youth
across
the
alps
our
tutor
was
convinced
that
no
water
microbe
could
resist
the
addition
of
a
little
kirsch
anyway
we
resisted
the
microbes
on
the
of
july
the
junction
of
the
two
armies
took
place
at
phillipsburg
three
leagues
rochambeau
writes
from
kingsbridge
the
first
post
of
the
enemy
in
the
island
of
new
york
the
american
army
having
followed
the
left
bank
of
the
hudson
in
order
to
reach
the
place
of
meeting
on
the
receipt
of
the
news
lord
germain
the
british
colonial
secretary
wrote
to
clinton
who
commanded
in
chief
at
new
york
the
junction
of
the
french
troops
with
the
americans
will
i
am
persuaded
soon
produce
disagreements
and
discontents
and
washington
will
find
it
necessary
to
separate
them
very
speedily
either
by
detaching
the
americans
to
the
southward
or
suffering
the
french
to
return
to
rhode
island
but
i
trust
before
that
can
happen
lord
cornwallis
will
have
given
the
loyal
inhabitants
on
both
sides
of
the
chesapeake
the
opportunity
they
have
so
long
ago
earnestly
desired
of
avowing
their
principles
and
standing
forth
in
support
of
the
measures
similar
proofs
of
my
lord
acumen
abound
in
his
partly
unpublished
correspondence
he
goes
on
rejoicing
and
deducting
all
the
happy
consequences
which
were
sure
to
result
from
the
meeting
of
the
french
and
american
troops
so
blandly
elated
at
the
prospect
as
to
remind
any
one
familiar
with
la
fontaine
fables
of
perrette
and
her
washington
in
the
meantime
was
reviewing
the
french
troops
july
and
rochambeau
the
american
ones
and
a
fact
which
would
have
greatly
surprised
lord
germain
the
worse
equipped
the
latter
were
the
greater
the
sympathy
and
admiration
among
the
french
for
their
endurance
those
brave
people
wrote
closen
it
really
pained
us
to
see
almost
naked
with
mere
linen
vests
and
trousers
most
of
them
without
stockings
but
would
you
believe
it
looking
very
healthy
and
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
further
on
i
am
full
of
admiration
for
the
american
troops
it
is
unbelievable
that
troops
composed
of
men
of
all
ages
even
of
children
of
fifteen
of
blacks
and
whites
all
nearly
naked
without
money
poorly
fed
should
walk
so
well
and
stand
the
enemy
fire
with
such
firmness
the
calmness
of
mind
and
the
clever
combinations
of
general
washington
in
whom
i
discover
every
day
new
eminent
qualities
are
already
enough
known
and
the
whole
universe
respects
and
admires
him
certain
it
is
that
he
is
admirable
at
the
head
of
his
army
every
member
of
which
considers
him
as
his
friend
and
father
these
sentiments
which
were
unanimous
in
the
french
army
assuredly
did
not
betoken
the
clash
counted
upon
by
the
english
colonial
secretary
and
more
than
one
of
our
officers
who
had
a
few
years
later
to
take
part
in
another
revolution
must
have
been
reminded
of
the
continental
soldiers
of
as
they
led
to
battle
fighting
for
a
similar
cause
our
volunteers
of
no
real
hatred
any
more
than
before
appeared
among
the
french
troops
for
those
enemies
whom
they
were
now
nearing
and
with
whom
they
had
already
had
some
sanguinary
skirmishes
during
the
intervals
between
military
operations
relations
were
courteous
and
at
times
amicable
the
english
gave
to
the
french
news
of
europe
even
when
the
news
was
good
for
the
latter
and
passed
to
them
newspapers
we
learned
that
news
necker
resignation
writes
blanchard
through
the
english
who
often
sent
trumpeters
and
passed
gazettes
to
us
we
learned
from
the
same
papers
that
de
la
had
captured
a
rich
convoy
these
exchanges
between
the
english
and
us
did
not
please
the
americans
nor
even
general
washington
who
were
unaccustomed
to
this
kind
of
warfare
the
fight
was
really
for
an
idea
but
what
might
have
dispelled
any
misgivings
with
no
possibility
of
a
change
of
idea
vii
two
unknown
factors
now
were
for
the
generals
the
cause
of
deep
concern
what
would
de
grasse
do
what
would
clinton
do
the
wounded
officer
of
johannisberg
the
winner
of
charleston
sir
henry
clinton
a
and
former
member
of
parliament
enjoying
great
repute
was
holding
new
york
not
yet
the
second
city
of
the
world
nor
even
the
first
of
the
united
states
covering
only
with
its
modest
houses
churches
and
gardens
the
lower
part
of
manhattan
and
reduced
owing
to
the
war
to
inhabitants
but
posted
there
the
english
commander
threatened
the
road
on
which
the
combined
armies
had
to
move
he
had
at
his
disposal
immense
stores
strong
fortifications
a
powerful
fleet
to
second
his
movements
and
troops
equal
in
number
and
training
to
ours
there
are
periods
in
the
history
of
nations
when
after
a
continuous
series
of
misfortunes
when
despair
would
have
seemed
excusable
suddenly
the
sky
clears
and
everything
turns
their
way
in
the
war
of
american
independence
such
a
period
had
begun
the
armies
of
washington
and
rochambeau
encumbered
with
their
carts
wagons
and
artillery
had
to
pass
rivers
to
cross
hilly
regions
to
follow
muddy
tracks
any
serious
attempt
against
them
might
have
proved
fatal
but
nothing
was
tried
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
that
clinton
should
as
long
as
possible
have
no
intimation
of
the
real
plans
of
the
everything
helped
to
mislead
him
his
natural
dispositions
as
well
as
circumstances
he
had
an
unshakable
conviction
that
the
key
to
the
whole
situation
was
new
york
and
that
the
royal
power
in
america
and
he
too
sir
henry
clinton
would
stand
or
fall
with
that
city
hence
his
disinclination
to
leave
it
and
to
attempt
anything
outside
his
instructions
ordered
him
to
help
cornwallis
to
his
utmost
the
plan
of
the
british
court
being
to
conquer
the
southern
states
first
and
then
continue
the
conquest
northward
but
he
on
the
contrary
was
day
after
day
asking
cornwallis
to
send
back
some
of
his
troops
and
while
as
he
never
ceased
to
point
out
afterward
he
was
careful
to
add
if
you
could
spare
them
he
also
remarked
in
the
same
letter
i
confess
i
could
not
conceive
you
would
require
above
in
a
station
where
general
arnold
has
represented
to
me
upon
report
of
colonel
simcoe
that
men
would
be
amply
sufficient
a
great
source
of
light
and
as
it
turned
out
of
darkness
also
was
the
intercepting
of
letters
this
constantly
happened
in
those
days
to
the
benefit
or
bewilderment
of
both
parties
on
land
or
at
sea
but
luck
had
decidedly
turned
and
the
stars
shone
propitious
for
the
allies
we
captured
valuable
letters
and
clinton
misleading
ones
it
was
something
of
a
retribution
after
he
had
so
often
used
or
tried
to
use
such
captures
to
his
advantage
as
when
having
seized
an
intimate
letter
of
washington
a
passage
of
which
might
have
given
umbrage
to
rochambeau
he
had
it
printed
in
the
newspapers
but
the
two
commanders
were
not
to
be
ruffled
so
easily
and
all
that
took
place
was
a
frank
explanation
spontaneously
acting
in
the
same
spirit
la
luzerne
had
written
to
rochambeau
concerning
washington
and
this
incident
i
have
told
all
those
that
have
spoken
to
me
of
it
that
i
saw
nothing
in
it
but
the
zeal
of
a
good
patriot
and
a
citizen
must
be
very
virtuous
for
his
enemies
not
to
find
other
crimes
to
reproach
him
with
more
treasures
had
now
fallen
into
the
hands
of
clinton
a
letter
of
chastellux
to
la
luzerne
speaking
very
superciliously
of
his
unmanageable
chief
rochambeau
and
of
his
bourrasques
in
it
he
congratulated
himself
as
rochambeau
narrates
on
having
cleverly
managed
to
cause
me
to
agree
with
general
washington
the
result
being
that
a
siege
of
the
island
of
new
york
had
at
last
been
determined
upon
he
added
complaints
about
the
small
chance
a
man
of
parts
had
to
influence
the
imperiousness
of
a
general
always
wanting
to
command
clinton
caused
that
letter
to
be
sent
to
rochambeau
obviously
with
no
view
writes
the
latter
to
the
preservation
of
peace
in
my
military
family
rochambeau
showed
it
to
chastellux
who
blushingly
acknowledged
its
authorship
the
general
thereupon
threw
it
into
the
fire
and
left
the
unfortunate
academician
a
prey
to
his
remorse
and
to
his
ignorance
for
he
was
careful
not
to
undeceive
him
as
to
the
real
plans
of
the
combined
army
a
text
of
the
conclusions
reached
at
the
weathersfield
conferences
was
no
less
happily
captured
by
clinton
and
we
have
seen
how
clearly
washington
had
there
expressed
his
reluctance
to
attempt
striking
the
chief
blow
in
the
south
a
letter
of
barras
to
la
luzerne
of
may
was
also
intercepted
and
as
luck
would
have
it
the
sailor
declared
in
it
his
intention
to
take
the
fleet
of
all
places
to
boston
a
real
project
but
abandoned
as
soon
as
formed
and
replaced
by
another
which
took
him
to
the
chesapeake
a
most
important
letter
of
rochambeau
to
la
luzerne
explaining
the
real
plan
was
thereupon
intercepted
it
was
in
cipher
and
the
english
managed
to
decipher
it
but
as
the
stars
shone
propitious
to
the
allies
it
was
only
the
english
in
london
and
not
those
in
new
york
who
could
do
it
and
when
the
translation
reached
clinton
at
last
he
had
no
longer
for
good
causes
any
doubt
as
to
the
real
aims
of
washington
and
rochambeau
the
colonial
secretary
was
in
the
meantime
kept
in
a
state
of
jubilation
by
so
much
and
the
news
forwarded
by
clinton
to
whom
he
wrote
the
copies
of
the
very
important
correspondence
which
so
fortunately
fell
into
your
hands
inclosed
in
your
despatch
show
the
rebel
affairs
to
be
almost
desperate
and
that
nothing
but
the
success
of
some
extraordinary
enterprise
can
give
vigor
and
activity
to
their
cause
and
i
confess
i
am
well
pleased
that
they
have
fixed
upon
new
york
as
the
object
to
be
attempted
clinton
acknowledged
a
little
later
to
lord
germain
the
receipt
of
a
reinforcement
of
about
german
troops
and
recruits
which
he
was
careful
to
hold
tight
in
new
york
till
the
end
the
combined
armies
had
in
the
meantime
done
their
best
to
confirm
the
english
commander
in
such
happy
dispositions
they
had
built
in
the
vicinity
of
new
york
brick
ovens
for
baking
bread
for
an
army
as
in
view
of
a
long
siege
there
had
been
reconnaissances
marches
and
countermarches
a
sending
of
ships
toward
long
island
without
entering
however
dans
la
baie
skirmishes
which
looked
like
preliminaries
to
more
important
operations
and
in
one
of
which
together
with
the
two
berthiers
and
count
de
vauban
closen
nearly
lost
his
life
in
order
to
save
his
hat
a
camp
proverb
about
hats
had
been
the
cause
of
his
taking
the
risk
when
he
returned
kind
washington
he
writes
in
his
journal
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
saying
baron
this
french
proverb
is
not
yet
known
among
our
army
but
your
cold
behavior
during
danger
will
be
it
in
english
in
the
original
as
being
the
very
words
of
the
great
man
to
the
young
one
though
does
probably
duty
for
and
the
final
is
certainly
not
washington
then
on
the
sudden
on
the
of
august
the
two
armies
raised
their
camps
disappeared
and
following
unusual
roads
moving
northward
at
first
for
three
marches
reached
in
the
midst
of
great
difficulties
under
a
torrid
heat
greatly
encumbered
with
heavy
baggage
the
hudson
river
and
crossed
it
at
king
ferry
without
being
more
interfered
with
than
before
how
can
such
an
inaction
on
the
part
of
clinton
be
explained
it
is
for
me
writes
count
guillaume
de
in
his
journal
the
manuscript
of
which
was
found
on
the
quays
in
paris
and
printed
in
america
an
undecipherable
enigma
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
be
reproached
for
having
puzzled
people
with
any
similar
ones
the
river
once
crossed
the
double
army
moved
southward
by
forced
marches
rochambeau
in
order
to
hasten
the
move
prescribed
the
leaving
behind
of
a
quantity
of
effects
and
this
says
closen
caused
considerable
grumbling
among
the
line
which
grumbled
but
marched
the
news
to
be
sure
of
so
important
a
movement
came
to
clinton
but
since
the
stars
had
ceased
to
smile
on
him
he
chose
to
conclude
as
he
wrote
to
lord
germain
on
the
of
september
this
to
be
a
feint
when
he
discovered
that
it
was
not
a
feint
the
army
was
beyond
reach
what
can
be
said
as
to
this
closen
writes
merrily
try
to
see
better
another
time
and
he
draws
a
pair
of
spectacles
on
the
margin
of
his
journal
the
march
southward
thus
continued
unhampered
they
crossed
first
the
jerseys
a
land
of
cockayne
for
game
fish
vegetables
poultry
closen
had
the
happiness
to
hear
from
the
lips
of
general
washington
and
on
the
ground
itself
a
description
of
the
dispositions
taken
the
movements
and
all
the
incidents

were
nearing

saw
in

distance
says

general
washington
shaking
his
hat
and
a
white
handkerchief
and
showing
signs
of
great
joy
rochambeau
had
scarcely
landed
when
washington
usually
so
cool
and
composed
fell
into
his
arms
the
great
news
had
arrived
de
grasse
had
come
and
while
cornwallis
was
on
the
defensive
at
yorktown
the
french
fleet
was
barring
the
chesapeake
on
the
receipt
of
letters
from
washington
rochambeau
and
la
luzerne
telling
him
to
what
extent
the
fate
of
the
united
states
was
in
his
hands
the
sailor
having
learned
with
much
sorrow
he
wrote
to
the
latter
what
was
the
distress
of
the
continent
and
the
need
there
was
of
immediate
help
had
decided
that
he
would
leave
nothing
undone
to
usefully
take
part
in
the
supreme
effort
which
without
his
help
might
be
attempted
in
vain
having
left
on
the
of
august
cap
français
cap
haïtien
he
had
added
to
his
fleet
all
the
available
ships
he
could
find
in
our
isles
including
some
which
having
been
years
away
had
received
orders
to
go
back
to
france
for
repairs
he
had
had
great
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
money
asked
for
although
he
had
offered
to
mortgage
for
it
his
castle
of
tilly
and
the
chevalier
de
charitte
in
command
of
the
had
made
a
like
offer
but
at
last
thanks
to
the
spanish
governor
at
havana
he
had
secured
the
desired
amount
of
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
he
was
bringing
moreover
the
marquis
de
with
the
regular
troops
under
his
command
de
grasse
only
request
was
that
operations
be
pushed
on
with
the
utmost
rapidity
as
he
was
bound
to
be
back
at
the
isles
at
a
fixed
date
it
can
truly
be
said
that
no
single
man
risked
nor
did
more
for
the
united
states
than
de
grasse
the
single
one
of
the
leaders
to
whom
no
memorial
has
been
dedicated
the
news
spread
like
the
camp
was
merry
with
songs
and
shouts
in
philadelphia
the
joy
was
indescribable
crowds
pressed
before
the
house
of

him
and
his

wrote
to
the
admiral
spread
universal
joy
throughout
america
with
which
she
is
wild
anxiety
was
renewed
however
when
it
was
learned
shortly
after
that
the
french
had
left
the
chesapeake
the
entrance
to
which
now
remained
free
the
english
fleet
of
twenty
ships
and
seven
frigates
under
hood
and
graves
the
same
graves
who
had
failed
to
intercept
rochambeau
convoy
had
been
signalled
on
the
of
september
and
de
grasse
leaving
behind
him
in
order
to
go
faster
some
of
his
ships
and
a
number
of
sailors
who
were
busy
on
land
had
weighed
anchor
of
an
hour
after
sighting
the
signals
to
risk
the
fight
upon
which
the
issue
of
the
campaign
and
as
it
turned
out
of
the
war
was
to
depend
this
behavior
of
count
de
grasse
wrote
the
famous
tarleton
is
worthy
of
admiration
six
days
later
the
french
admiral
was
back
he
had
had
officers
and
sailors
killed
or
wounded
but
he
had
lost
no
ship
and
the
enemy
fleet
very
much
damaged
with
men
killed
or
disabled
and
having
lost
the
of
guns
and
the
frigates
and
of
had
been
compelled
to
retreat
to
new

admiral
robert

thereupon
arrived
with
naval
reinforcements
yet
i
do
not
think
la

wrote
to
rochambeau
that
battle
will
be
offered
again
if
it
is
i
am
not
anxious
about
the
result
nothing
was
attempted
this
superiority
at

in

of

the
strength
of
the
enemies
of

britain
deranged
the
plans
of
her
generals
disheartened
the
courage
of

friends
and
finally
confirmed
the
independency
of

nothing
rochambeau
had
written
in
his
at
starting
without
naval
supremacy
on
the
bay
de
grasse
had
the
pleasure
to
find
there
another
french
fleet
that
of
his
friend
barras
as
a
de
grasse
outranked
him
but
as
a
chef
barras
was
his
senior
officer
which
might
have
caused
difficulties
the
latter
could
be
tempted
and
he
was
to
conduct
a
campaign
apart
so
as
to
personally
reap
the
glory
of
possible
successes
i
leave
it
to
thee
my
dear
barras
de
grasse
had
written
him
on
the
of
july
to
come
and
join
me
or
to
act
on
thy
own
account
for
the
good
of
the
common
cause
do
only
let
me
know
so
that
we
do
not
hamper
each
other
unawares
barras
preferred
the
service
of
the
cause
to
his
own
interest
leaving
newport
going
far
out
on
the
high
seas
then
dashing
south
at
a
great
distance
from
the
coast
he
escaped
the
english
and
reached
the
chesapeake
bringing
the
heavy
siege
artillery
now
indispensable
for
the
last
operations
the
stars
had
continued
incredibly
propitious
the
double
siege
now
began
that
of
yorktown
by
washington
and
rochambeau
and
that
of
gloucester
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
which
might
have
afforded
a
place
of
retreat
to
cornwallis
de
grasse
had
consented
to
land
in
view
of
the
latter
men
under
choisy
whom
lauzun
joined
with
his
legion
and
both
acted
in
conjunction
with
the
american
militia
under
weedon
the
two
chiefs
on
the
yorktown
side
were
careful
to
conduct
the
operations
according
to
rules
on
account
says
closen
of
the
reputation
of
cornwallis
and
the
strength
of
the
garrison
such
rules
were
certainly
familiar
to
rochambeau
whose
fifteenth
siege
this
one
was
from
day
to
day
cornwallis
was
more
narrowly
pressed
as
late
as
the
of
september
he
was
still
full
of
hope
i
have
ventured
these
two
days
he
wrote
to
clinton
to
look
general
washington
whole
force
in
the
face
in
the
position
on
the
outside
of
my
works
and
i
have
the
pleasure
to
assure
your
excellency
that
there
was
but
one
wish
throughout
the
whole
army
which
was
that
the
enemy
would
advance
a
dozen
days
later
the
tone
was
very
different
i
have
only
to
repeat
that
nothing
but
a
direct
move
to
york
river
which
includes
a
successful
naval
action
can
save
me
many
of
our
works
are
considerably
damaged
lord
germain
was
in
the
meantime
writing
to
clinton
in
his
happiest
mood
on
the
of
october
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
find
that
the
plan
you
had
concerted
for
conducting
the
military
operations
in
that
quarter
the
chesapeake
corresponds
with
what
i
had
suggested
the
court
which
had
no
more
misgivings
than
lord
germain
himself
had
caused
to
sail
with
digby
no
less
a
personage
than
prince
william
one
of
the
fifteen
children
of
george
iii
and
eventually
one
of
his
successors
as
william
iv
but
his
presence
could
only
prove
one
more
encumbrance
after
the
familiar
incidents
of
the
siege
in
which
the
american
and
french
armies
displayed
similar
valor
and
met
with
about
the
same
losses
the
decisive
move
of
the
night
attack
on
the
enemy
advanced
redoubts
had
to
be
made
one
of
the
redoubts
to
be
stormed
by
the
americans
with
lafayette
and
the
other
by
the
french
under
viomesnil
rochambeau
addressed
himself
especially
to
the
grenadiers
of
the
regiment
of
gatinais
which
had
been
formed
with
a
portion
of
his
old
regiment
of
auvergne
and
said
my
boys
if
i
need
you
i
hope
you
will
not
have
forgotten
that
we
have
served
together
in
that
brave
regiment
of
auvergne
sans
tache
spotless
auvergne
an
honorable
surname
deserved
by
it
since
its
formation
they
answered
that
if
he
would
promise
to
have
their
former
name
restored
to
them
he
would
find
they
were
ready
to
die
to
the
last
they
kept
their
word
losing
many
of
their
number
and
one
of
the
first
requests
of
rochambeau
when
he
reached
paris
was
that
their
old
name
be
given
back
to
them
which
was
done
gatinais
thus
became
royal
auvergne
and
is
now
the
infantry
on
the
of
october
after
a
loss
of
less
than
men
in
each
of
the
besieging
armies
an
act
was
signed
as
great
in
its
consequences
as
any
that
ever
followed
the
bloodiest
battles
the
capitulation
of
yorktown
it
was
in
a
way
the
ratification
of
that
other
act
which
had
been
proposed
for
signature
five
years
before
at
philadelphia
by
men
whose
fate
had
more
than
once
in
the
interval
seemed
desperate
the
declaration
of
independence
on
the
same
day
closen
writes
the
york
garrison
marched
past
at
two
before
the
combined
army
which
was
formed
in
two
lines
the
french
facing
the
americans
and
in
full
dress
uniform
passing
between
the
two
armies
the
english
showed
much
disdain
for
the
americans
who
so
far
as
dress
and
appearances
went
represented
the
seamy
side
many
of
those
poor
boys
being
garbed
in
linen
torn
soiled
a
number
among
them
almost
shoeless
the
english
had
given
them
the
nickname
of
what
does
it
matter
the
man
of
sense
will
think
they
are
the
more
to
be
praised
and
show
the
greater
valor
fighting
as
they
do
so
badly
equipped
as
a
man
of
sense
rochambeau
writes
in
his
memoirs
this
justice
must
be
rendered
to
the
americans
that
they
behaved
with
a
zeal
a
courage
an
emulation
which
left
them
in
no
case
behind
in
all
that
part
of
the
siege
intrusted
to
them
in
spite
of
their
being
unaccustomed
to
sieges
the
city
offered
a
pitiful
sight
i
shall
never
forget
says
closen
how
horrible
and
painful
to
behold
was
the
aspect
of
the
town
of
york
one
could
not
walk
three
steps
without
finding
big
holes
made
by
bombs
splinters
barely
covered
graves
arms
and
legs
of
blacks
and
whites
scattered
here
and
there
most
of
the
houses
riddled
with
shot
and
devoid
of
window
panes
we
found
lord
cornwallis
in
his
house
his
attitude
evinced
the
nobility
of
his
soul
his
magnanimity
and
firmness
of
character
he
seemed
to
say
i
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
i
have
done
my
duty
and
defended
myself
to
the
utmost
this
impression
of
lord
cornwallis
was
general
as
to
closen
description
of
the
town
now
so
quiet
and
almost
asleep
by
the
blue
water
amid
her
once
more
torn
and
during
the
civil
war
resting
at
the
foot
of
the
great
marble
memorial
raised
a
hundred
years
later
by
congress
it
is
confirmed
by
abbé
robin
who
notices
too
the
quantity
of
human
limbs
which
infected
the
air
but
also
being
an
abbé
the
number
of
books
scattered
among
the
ruins
many
being
works
of
piety
and
theological
controversy
and
with
them
the
works
of
the
famous
pope
and
translations
of
of
and
of
the
on
by
monsieur
thomas
that
stern
essay
so
popular
then
in
america
in
which
society
ladies
were
invited
to
fill
their
soul
with
those
sentiments
of
nature
which
are
born
in
retreat
and
grow
in
silence
nothing
better
puts
in
its
true
light
the
dominant
characteristic
of
the
french
sentiment
throughout
the
war
than
what
happened
on
this
solemn
occasion
and
more
shows
how
with
their
enthusiasm
for
philanthropy
and
liberty
the
french
were
much
more
than
no
trace
of
a
triumphant
attitude
toward
a
vanquished
enemy
appeared
in
anything
they
did
or
said
even
in
the
surrendering
the
fact
remained
apparent
that
this
was
not
a
war
of
hatred
the
english
writes
abbé
robin
laid
down
their
arms
at
the
place
selected
care
was
taken
not
to
admit
sightseers
so
as
to
diminish
their
humiliation
henry
lee
harry
who
was
present
describes
in
the
same
spirit
the
march
past
universal
silence
was
observed
amidst
the
vast
concourse
and
the
utmost
decency
prevailed
exhibiting
in
demeanor
an
awful
sense
of
the
vicissitudes
of
human
life
mingled
with
commiseration
for
the
unhappy
the
victors
pitied
cornwallis
and
showed
him
every
consideration
rochambeau
learning
that
he
was
without
money
lent
him
all
he
wanted
he
invited
him
to
dine
with
him
and
his
officers
on
the
of
november
lord
cornwallis
writes
closen
especially
distinguished
himself
by
his
reflective
turn
of
mind
his
noble
and
gentle
manners
he
spoke
freely
of
his
campaigns
in
the
carolinas
and
though
he
had
won
several
victories
he
acknowledged
nevertheless
that
they
were
the
cause
of
the
present
misfortunes
all
with
the
exception
of
tarleton
spoke
french
in
particular
to
perfection
but
he
seemed
to
us
something
of
a
brag
a
friendly
correspondence
began
between
the
english
general
and
some
of
the
french
officers
viscount
de
noailles
the
one
who
had
walked
all
the
way
lending
him
the
week
after
the
capitulation
his
copy
of
the
beforementioned
famous
work
of
count
de
guibert
on
which
was
at
that
time
the
talk
of
europe
and
of
which
napoleon
said
later
that
it
was
such
as
to
form
great
men
the
same
guibert
who
expected
lasting
repute
from
that
work
and
from
his
military
services
and
who
irony
of
fate
general
and
academician
though
he
was
is
chiefly
remembered
as
the
hero
of
the
letters
of
mademoiselle
de
lespinasse
cornwallis
realized
quite
well
that
the
french
had
fought
for
a
cause
dear
to
their
hearts
more
than
from
any
desire
to
humble
him
or
his
nation
he
publicly
rendered
full
justice
to
the
enemy
acknowledging
that
the
fairest
treatment
had
been
awarded
him
by
them
in
the
final
report
in
which
he
gives
his
own
account
of
the
catastrophe
and
which
he
caused
to
be
printed
when
he
reached
england
he
said
the
kindness
and
attention
that
has
been
shown
us
by
the
french
officers
their
delicate
sensibility
of
our
situation
their
generous
and
pressing
offers
of
money
both
public
and
private
to
any
amount
has
really
gone
beyond
what
i
can
possibly
describe
and
will
i
hope
make
an
impression
on
the
breast
of
every
british
officer
whenever
the
fortunes
of
war
should
put
any
of
them
in
our
power
the
french
attitude
in
the
new
world
was
in
perfect
accord
with
the
french
sentiments
in
the
old
on
receiving
from
lauzun
and
count
de
who
for
fear
of
capture
had
sailed
in
two
different
frigates
the
news
of
the
taking
of
cornwallis
of
his
men
of
whom
were
in
hospitals
sailors
guns
and
flags
the
king
wrote
to
rochambeau
monsieur
le
comte
de
rochambeau
the
success
of
my
arms
flatters
me
only
as
being
conducive
to
peace
and
thanking
the
author
of
all
prosperity
he
announced
the
sending
of
letters
to
the
archbishops
and
bishops
of
his
kingdom
for
a
to
be
sung
in
all
the
churches
of
their
dioceses
it
was
a
long
time
since
the
old
cocks
of
the
french
churches
had
quivered
at
the
points
of
the
steeples
to
the
chant
of
a
for
a
victory
leading
to
a
glorious
peace
the
victory
was
over
those
enemies
who
not
so
very
long
before
had
bereft
us
of
canada
nothing
more
significant
than
the
pastoral
letter
of

appointing
the
date
for
the
thanksgiving
ceremonies
and
adding
this
so
important
advantage
has
been
the
result
of
the
wisest
measures
reason
and
humanity
have
gauged
it
and
have
placed
it
far
above
those
memorable
but
bloody
victories
whose
lustre
has
been
tarnished
by
almost
universal
mourning
here
the
blood
of
our
allies
and
of
our
generous
compatriots
has
been
spared
and
why
should
we
not
note
with
satisfaction
that
the
forces
of
our
enemies
have
been
considerably
weakened
their
efforts
baffled
the
fruits
of
their
immense
expense
lost
without
our
having
caused
rivers
of
their
blood
to
be
spilt
without
our
having
filled
their
country
with
unfortunate
widows
and
mothers
for
this
too
as
well
as
for
the
victory
thanks
must
be
offered
and
for
this
too
for
such
a
rare
and
such
a
humane
feeling
the
name
of
bishop
de
la
tour
du
pin
montauban
deserves
to
be
remembered
the
nation
at
large
felt
like
the
bishop
one
of
the
most
typical
of
the
publications
inspired
in
france
by
the
war
and
its
outcome
was
the
of
xenophon
newly
found
in
the
ruins
of
palmyra
translated
from
the
anonymously
printed
in
in
which
under
the
names
of
greeks
and
carthaginians
the
story
of
the
campaign
is
told
the
chief
actors
being
easily
recognized
most
of
them
under

the
illustrious
filaatete

and

wise

of

franklin
critical
minds
the
author
observes
will
perhaps
think
they
discover
anachronisms
but
such
mean
nothing
he
will
soon
give
an
edition
of
the
greek
original
splendidly
printed
so
the
wealthy
amateurs
will
buy
it
without
being
able
to
read
it
the
learned
who
could
read
it
will
be
unable
to
buy
it
and
everybody
will
be
pleased
the
author
gives
a
detailed
description
of
the
greeks
and
of
the
carthaginians
that
is
the
french
and
their
former
enemies
the
english
greece
owing
to
her
intellectual
and
artistic
predominance
seemed
to
lead
the
rest
of
the
world
and
athens
led
greece
the
athenians
were
truth
to
say
accused
of
inconstancy
they
were
reproached
for
the
mobility
of
their
character
their
fondness
for
new
things
their
leaning
toward
raillery
but
there
was
something
pleasing
in
their
defects
justice
was
moreover
rendered
to
their
rare
qualities
gentle
as
they
were
and
softened
by
their
fondness
for
enjoyment
they
nonetheless
were
attracted
by
danger
and
prodigal
of
their
blood
they
felt
as
much
passion
for
glory
as
for
pleasure
arbiters
in
matters
of
taste
they
played
the
same
rôle
in
questions
of
honor
an
idol
with
them
somewhat
they
were
withal
frank
and
generous
this
brilliant
and
famous
nation
was
such
that
those
among
her
enemies
that
cast
most
reproaches
at
her
envied
the
fate
of
the
citizens
living
within
her
borders
whether
succeeding
events
have
cured
or
not
some
of
that
any
one
can
see
and
form
his
judgment
as
to
carthaginians
the
english
no
animosity
no
hatred
but
on
the
contrary
greater
praise
than
was
accorded
to
his
own
compatriots
by
many
an
english
writer
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
they
never
made
a
finer
defense
they
faced
everywhere
all
their
enemies
and
disastrous
as
the
result
may
have
proved
for
them
this
part
of
their
annals
will
remain
one
of
the
most
glorious
why
should
we
hesitate
to
render
them
justice
yes
if
the
intrepid
defender
of
the
columns
of
hercules
were
present
in
person
at
our
celebration
he
would
receive
the
tribute
of
praise
and
applause
that
greeks
know
how
to
pay
to
any
brave
and
generous
enemy
this
way
of
thinking
had
nothing
exceptional
one
of
the
most
authoritative
publicists
of
the
day
lacretelle
in
considering
in
the
de
the
future
of
the
united
states
praised
the
favorable
influence
exercised
on
them
by
the
so
much
admired
british
constitution
the
most
wonderful
government
in
europe
for
it
will
be
england
glory
to
have
created
peoples
worthy
of
throwing
off
her
yoke
even
though
she
must
endure
the
reproach
of
having
forced
them
to
independence
by
forgetfulness
of
her
own
maxims
as
to
the
members
of
the
french
army
who
had
started
for
the
new
crusade
two
years
before
they
had
at
once
the
conviction
that
in
accordance
with
their
anticipation
they
had
witnessed
something
great
which
would
leave
a
profound
trace
in
the
history
of
the
world
they
brought
home
the
seed
of
liberty
and
equality
the
virus
as
it
was
called
by
pontgibaud
who
friend
as
he
was
of
lafayette
resisted
the
current
to
the
last
and
remained
a
royalist
the
young
french
nobility
says
talleyrand
in
his
memoirs
having
enlisted
for
the
cause
of
independence
clung
ever
after
to
the
principle
which
it
had
gone
to
defend
youthful
the
future
thus
summed
up
his
impressions
of
the
campaign
i
felt
that
the
american
revolution
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
political
era
that
this
revolution
would
necessarily
set
moving
an
important
progress
in
general
civilization
and
that
it
would
before
long
occasion
great
changes
in
the
social
order
then
existing
in
europe
many
experienced
the
feeling
described
in
the
last
lines
of
his
journal
by
count
guillaume
de
wounded
at
the
storming
of
the
redoubts
with
troops
as
good
and
brave
and
as
those
which
i
have
had
the
honor
to
lead
against
the
enemy
one
can
undertake
anything
i
owe
them
the
greatest
day
in
my
life
the
souvenir
of
which
will
never
die
out
man
life
is
mixed
with
trials
but
one
can
no
longer
complain
when
having
enjoyed
the
delightful
moments
which
are
their
counterpart
a
single
instant
effaces
such
troubles
and
that
instant
well
resented
causes
one
to
desire
new
trials
so
as
to
once
more
enjoy
their
recompense

rochambeau
remained
in

peace
was
a
possibility
not
a
certainty
in
london
where
so
late
as
november
the
most
encouraging
news
continued
to
be
received
but
where
that
of
the
catastrophe
brought
by
the
arrived
on
the
george
iii
and
his
ministers
refused
to
yield
to
evidence
lord
germain
especially
for
whom
the
shock
had
been
great
and
who
was
beseeching
parliament
to
proceed
with
vigor
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
and
not
leave
it
in
the
power
of
the
french
to
tell
the
americans
that
they
had
procured
their
independence
and
were
consequently
entitled
to
a
preference
if
not
an
exclusive
right
in
their
trade
this
was
not
to
know
us
well
our
treaty
of
commerce
had
been
signed
three
years
before
at
a
time
when
anything
would
have
been
granted
to
propitiate
france
but
there
was
not
in
it
as
we
saw
one
single
advantage
that
was
not
equally
accessible
to
any
one
who
chose
the
english
included
as
for
king
george
he
decided
that
the
of
february
would
be
a
day
of
national
fasting
to
ask
pardon
for
past
sins
and
implore
heaven
assistance
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
franklin
was
still
beseeching
his
compatriots
to
be
on
their
guard
it
seems
the
english
nation
is
sick
of
the
war
but
the
king
is
obstinate
the
ministry
you
will
see
declare
that
the
war
in
america
is
for
the
future
to
be
only
i
hope
we
shall
be
too
prudent
to
have
the
least
dependence
on
this
declaration
it
is
only
thrown
out
to
lull
us
for
depend
upon
it
the
king
hates
us
cordially
and
will
be
content
with
nothing

noting
a
number
of
traits
which
were

taken
up
again
by

the

equality

the

neither
a
castellated
lord
nor
a

but
a
landowner
it
takes
him
thirty
to
forty
years
to
rise
from
the

made
of
logs
and

with
the
house
of

sometimes
by
his
fondness
for
animals
of
which
he
was
making
a
small
collection

of

so

closen
becomes
acquainted
with
a
very
curious
animal
which
the
people
of
the
region
call
a
but
which
i
believe
to
be
the
the
stinking
one
and
a
careful
description
shows
that
in
any
case
the
name
well
fitted
the
animal
he
also
studies
groundhogs
on
the

occasion
the
charm
and
picturesqueness
of
wild
life
in

is
a
trait
which
french

noted
with
amused
curiosity
in

a

at
times
have
caused
embarrassment

this

the
hospitality
is
according

brilliant

ornamented
as

proved
costly

frightened

their
thanks
not
only
for
the
services
rendered
by
the

his
military
capacity
but
they
said
for
your
conduct
in
the
more
private
walks
of

and
the
happiness
we
have
derived
from
the
social
polite

the
favorable
impression
left
by
an
army
permeated
with
the
growing
humanitarian
spirit
is
especially
mentioned
in

of

reward
your

in
the
cause

the
particular
regard
you
have
paid
to
the
rights
of
the
citizens
writing
at
the
moment
when
departure
was
imminent
the
maryland
assembly
recalled
in
its
address
the
extraordinary
prejudices
prevailing
shortly
before
in
america
against
all
that
was
french
to
preserve
in
troops
far
removed
from
their
own
country
the
strictest
discipline
and
convert
into
esteem
and
affection
deep
and
ancient
was
reserved
for
you
we
view
with
regret
the
departure
of
troops
which
have
so
conducted
so
endeared
and
so
distinguished
themselves
and
we
pray
that
the
laurels
they
have
gathered
before
yorktown
may
never
fade
and
that
victory
to
whatever
quarter
of
the
globe
they
direct
their
arms
may
follow
their
standard
the
important
result
of
a
change
in
american
sentiment
toward
the
french
apart
from
the
military
service
rendered
by
them
was
confirmed
to
rochambeau
by
la
luzerne
who
wrote
him
your
and
brave
army
has
not
only
contributed
to
put
an
end
to
the
success
of
the
english
in
this
country
but
has
destroyed
in
three
years
prejudices
for
three
centuries
the
president
and
professors
of
the
university
of
william
and
mary
using
a
style
which
was
to
become
habitual
in
france
but
a
few
years
later
desired
to
address
rochambeau
not
in
the
prostituted
language
of
fashionable
flattery
but
with
the
voice
of
truth
and
republican
sincerity
and
after
thanks
for
the
services
rendered
and
the
payment
made
for
the
building
destroyed
by
an
accident
that
often
eludes
all
possible
precaution
they
adverted
to
the
future
intellectual
intercourse
between
the
two
nations
saying
among
the
many
substantial
advantages
which
this
country
hath
already
derived
and
which
must
ever
continue
to
flow
from
its
connection
with
france
we
are
persuaded
that
the
improvement
of
useful
knowledge
will
not
be
the
least
a
number
of
distinguished
characters
in
your
army
afford
us
the
happiest
presage
that
science
as
well
as
liberty
will
acquire
vigor
from
the
fostering
hand
of
your
nation
they
concluded
you
have
reaped
the
noblest
laurels
that
victory
can
bestow
and
it
is
perhaps
not
an
inferior
triumph
to
have
obtained
the
sincere
affection
of
a
grateful
people
in
order
to
foster
as
the
authors
of
the
address
said
such
sentiments
as
to
a
possible
intellectual
intercourse
the
french
king
sent
to
this
university
as
the
college
was
then
called
two
hundred
volumes
of
the
greatest
and
best
french
works
but
la
rochefoucauld
adds
after
having
seen
them
in
they
arrived
greatly
damaged
because
the
richmond
merchant
who
had
undertaken
to
convey
them
to
the
college
forgot
them
for
a
pretty
long
time
in
his
cellar
in
the
midst
of
his
oil
and
sugar
barrels
fire
has
since
completed
the
havoc
so
that
of
the
two
hundred
only
two
are
now
left
exhibited
under
glass
in
the
of
the
college
they
are
parts
of
the
works
of
bailly
then
of
european
fame
as
an
astronomer
and
scientist
who
was
however
to
count
in
history
for
something
else
than
his
sur
de
for
he
was
the
same
bailly
who
a
few
years
later
presided
over
the
national
assembly
sending
to
the
royal
purchaser
of
his
works
the
famous
reply
the
nation
assembled
can
receive
no
orders
and
who
two
days
after
the
fall
of
the
bastille
was
acclaimed
by
the
crowd
mayor
of
paris
while
lafayette
was
acclaimed
of
the
national
guard
another
gift
of
books
was
sent
with
the
same
intent
by
the
king
of
france
to
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
though
many
have
disappeared
the
fate
of
this
collection
has
been
happier
a
number
of
those
volumes
are
still
in
use
at
philadelphia
works
which
had
been
selected
as
being
likely
to
prove
of
greatest
advantage

i
confess
people

this

nine
hundred
and
eighty
miles
in
less

nine

hours
as
the
summer
of
was
drawing
near
the
french
army
which
had
wintered
in
virginia
moved
northward
in
view
of
possible
operations
this
was
for
closen
an
occasion
to
visit
mount
vernon
where
rochambeau
had
stopped
with
washington
the
year
before
when
on
their
way
to
yorktown
the
house
says
the

is
quite
vast
and
perfectly
distributed
with
handsome
furniture
and
is
admirably
kept
without
luxury
there
are
two
pavilions
connected
with
it
and
a
number
of
farm
buildings
behind
the
pavilion
on

an
immense
garden
with
the
most
exquisite
fruit
in

country
washington
gracefully
entertains
the
visitor
as
well
as
colonel
de

the
same
who
was
to
win
and
lose
battles
and
die
beheaded
in
the
french
revolution
some
ten
officers
of
the

regiment
which
was

ahead
of

brought
on

a
porcelain

beauty
and
in
the

with

by
a

washington
was
delighted
with
de

attention
and
most
gracefully
expressed
her
gratitude
all
leave
that
same
evening
except
closen
who
had
again
found
there
the
incomparable
custis
whose
silhouette
he
took
and
inserted
in
his
journal
and
who
remained
one
day
more
being
treated
with
the
utmost
affability
by
these
ladies
whose
society
he
notes
was
most
sweet
and
pleasant
to
me
he
leaves
at

rather
sad
moving

the

again
start
not
later
than
two
in

morning
as
in
the
previous
summer
the
french
officers
notice
the
extraordinary
progress
realized
since
their
first
visit
at
wilmington
says
closen
some
fifty
brick
houses
have
been
built
very
fine
and
large
since
we
first
passed
which
gives
a
charming
appearance
to
the
main
street
at
philadelphia
la

is
ready
with
another
magnificent
entertainment
a
dauphin
has
been
born
to

and
a
beautiful

has
been
built
on
purpose
for
the
intended
banquet
by
a
french

serving
in

american
corps
of

major
the

future
federal
city
on
the
of
august
washington
and
rochambeau
were
again
together
in
the
vicinity
of
the
north
river
and
the
american
troops
were
again
reviewed
by
the
french
general
they
are
no
longer
in
tatters
but
well
dressed
and
have
a
fine
appearance
their
bearing
their
manœuvres
are
perfect
the
who
causes
his
drums
rochambeau
relates
to
beat
the
french

is
delighted
to
show
his
soldiers
to
advantage
everybody
compliments
him
during
his
stay
at
providence
in
the
course
of
his
journey
north
rochambeau
gave
numerous
fêtes
a
charming
picture
of
which
as
well
as
of
the
american
society
attending
them
is
furnished
us
by
ségur
de
rochambeau
desirous
to
the
very
last
of
proving
by
the
details
of
his
conduct
as
well
as
by
the
great
services
he
had
rendered
how
much
he
wished
to
keep
the
affection
of
the
americans
and
to
carry
away
their
regrets
gave
in
the
city
of
providence
frequent
assemblies
and
numerous
balls
to
which
people
flocked
from
ten
leagues
around
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
gathered
together
in
any
other
spot
more
gayety
and
less
confusion
more
pretty
women
and
more
happily
married
couples
more
grace
and
less
coquetry
a
more
complete
mingling
of
persons
of
all
classes
between
whom
an
equal
decency
allowed
no
untoward
difference
to
be
seen
that
decency
that
order
that
wise
liberty
that
felicity
of
the
new
republic
so
ripe
from
its
very
cradle
were
the
continual
subject
of
my
surprise
and
the
object
of
my
frequent
talks
with
the
chevalier
de
chastellux
ix
in
the
autumn
of
a
general
parting
took
place
rochambeau
returning
to
france
and
the
army
being
sent
to
the
isles
believed
now
to
be
threatened
by
the
english
for
if
the
war
was
practically
at
an
end
for
the
americans
on
the
continent
it
was
not
yet
the
same
elsewhere
for
us
and
suffren
especially
was
prosecuting
in
the
indies
his
famous
naval
campaign
which
owing
to
the
lack
of
means
of
communication
was
to
be
continued
long
after
peace
had
been
signed
so
many
friendships
had
been
formed
that
there
was
much
emotion
when
the
last
days
arrived
on
the
of
october
being
the
anniversary
of
yorktown
washington
offered
a
dinner
to
the
french
officers
who
on
the
same
day
took
leave
of
him
never
to
see
him
again
on
that
evening
says
closen
we
took
leave
of
general
washington
and
of
the
other
officers
of
our
acquaintance
our
troops
being
to
sail
on
the
there
is
no
sort
of
kindness
and
tokens
of
good
will
we
have
not
received
from
general
washington
the
idea
of
parting
from
the
french
army
probably
forever
seemed
to
cause
him
real
sorrow
having
as
he
had
received
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
the
respect
the
veneration
the
esteem
and
even
the
attachment
which
every
individual
in
the
army
felt
for
him
after
having
taken
leave
in
tenderest
fashion
of
the
american
commander
who
promised
an
enduring
fraternal
friendship
rochambeau
carrying
with
him
two
bronze
taken
at
yorktown
presented
by
congress
and
adorned
with
inscriptions
the
engraving
of
which
had
been
supervised
by
washington
sailed
for
france
on
the
early
in
january
an
english
warship
which
had
been
cruising
at
the
entrance
of
the
chesapeake
nearly
captured
him
and
it
was
only
by
throwing
overboard
her
spare
masts
and
part
of
her
artillery
that
the
thus
become
lighter
and
faster
could
escape
the
general
learned
on
landing
of
the
peace
which
vergennes
had
considered
from
the
first
as
a
certain
though
not
immediate
consequence
of
the
taking
of
yorktown
the
homages
of
all
frenchmen
go
to
you
he
had
written
to
rochambeau
adding
you
have
restored
to
our
arms
all
their
lustre
and
you
have
laid
the
cornerstone
for
the
raising
which
we
expect
of
an
honorable
peace
the
hour
for
it
had
now
struck
and
while
suffren
had
yet
to
win
the
naval
battle
of
goudelour
the
preliminaries
had
been
signed
at
versailles
on
the
of
january
the
king
the
ministers
the
whole
country
gave
rochambeau
the
welcome
he
deserved
at
his
first
audience
on
his
return
he
had
asked
louis
xvi
as
being
his
chief
request
permission
to
divide
the
praise
bestowed
on
him
with
the
unfortunate
de
grasse
now
a
prisoner
of
the
english
after
the
battle
of
the
saintes
where
fighting
against
he
had
lost
seven
ships
including
the
de
which
had
dead
and
wounded
all
so
damaged
by
the
most
furious
resistance
that
owing
to
grounding
to
sinking
or
to
fire
not
one
reached
the
english
waters
rochambeau
received
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
holy
ghost
was
appointed
governor
of
picardy
and
a
few
years
later
became
a
marshal
of
france
owing
to
the
proximity
of
his
new
post
he
was
able
twice
to
visit
england
where
he
met
again
his
dear
la
luzerne
now
french
ambassador
in
london
and
his
former
foe
admiral
hood
who
received
him
with
open
arms
but
the
tokens
of
friendship
which
touched
him
most
came
from
officers
of
cornwallis
army
they
manifested
he
writes
in
the
most
public
manner
their
gratitude
for
the
humanity
with
which
they
had
been
treated
by
the
french
army
after
their
surrender
rochambeau
was
keeping
up
with
washington
a
most
affectionate
correspondence
still
partly
unpublished
the
great
american
often
reminding
him
of
his
friendship
and
love
for
his
companions
in
war
discussing
a
possible
visit
to
france
and
describing
his
life
now
spent
in
rural
employments
and
in
contemplation
of
those
friendships
which
the
revolution
enabled
me
to
form
with
so
many
worthy
characters
of
your
nation
through
whose
assistance
i
can
now
sit
down
in
my
calm
retreat
dreaming
of
a
humanity
less
agitated
than
that
he
had
known
dreaming
dreams
which
were
not
to
be
soon
realized
he
was
writing
to
rochambeau
from
mount
vernon
on
september
although
it
is
against
the
profession
of
arms
i
wish
to
see
all
the
world
at
peace
much
as
he
may
wish
to
conceal
himself
and
lead
the
life
of
a
plain
man
he
will
ever
be
the
first
citizen
of
the
united
states
la
luzerne
had
written
to
vergennes
and
the
truth
of
the
statement
was
shown
when
a
unanimous
election
made
of
the
former
the
first
president
of
the
new
republic
in
the
year
when
the
states
general
met
in
france
and
our
own
revolution
began
knowing
the
friendly
dispositions
preserved
by
rochambeau
toward
americans
washington
often
gave
those
going
abroad
letters
of
introduction
to
him
one
day
the
man
was
gouverneur
morris
so
well
known
afterward
another
day
it
was
a
poet
of
great
fame
then
of
not
so
great
now
less
sure
of
his
ground
when
the
question
was
of
parnassus
than
when
it
was
of
washington
had
described
this
traveller
to
lafayette
as
being
considered
by
those
who
are
good
judges
to
be
a
genius
of
the
first
magnitude
to
rochambeau
he
introduced
him
as
the
author
of
an
admirable
poem
in
which
he
has
worthily
celebrated
the
glory
of
your
nation
in
general
and
of
yourself
in
particular
the
poet
was
that
joel
barlow
of
hartford
who
having
become
later
minister
of
the
united
states
to
france
died
in
a
polish
village
in
the
course
of
a
journey
undertaken
to
present
his
credentials
to
the
chief
of
the
state
who
for
important
reasons
had
been
unable
to
grant
him
an
audience
elsewhere
than
in
russia
the
year
being
and
the
sovereign
emperor
napoleon
the
poem
alluded
to
by
washington
was
an
epic
one
called
the
of
in
which
an
angel
appears
to
the
navigator
in
his
legendary
prison
and
reveals
to
him
in
virgilian
fashion
the
future
of
america
washington
wayne
greene
are
thus
shown
him
as
well
as
brave
rochambeau
in
gleamy
steel
array
a
description
which
if
brave
rochambeau
ever
saw
it
must
have
made
him
smile
rochambeau
letters
are
in
such
english
as
we
have
seen
he
had
been
able
with
commendable
zeal
to
learn
late
in
life
the
french
general
keeps
the
american
leader
informed
of
what
goes
on
in
france
in
england
and
europe
bestows
the
highest
praise
on
pitt
a
wise
man
who
sets
finances
of
the
english
in
good
order
and
gives
an
account
of
a
visit
paid
him
by
cornwallis
at
calais
i
have
seen
cornwallis
last
summer
at
calais
i
gave
him
a
supper
in
little
committee
he
was
very
polite
but
as
you
may
believe
i
could
not
drink
with
him
your
health
in
toast
he
tells
washington
of
franklin
departure
from
france
very
old
very
ill
greatly
admired
having
the
courage
to
undertake
so
long
a
voyage
to
go
and
die
in
the
bosom
of
his
native
country
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
at
his
coming
back
to
america
to
go
and
visit
you
but
i
told
him
that
you
would
certainly
go
and
see
him
and
that
i
had
always
heard
you
speaking
of
him
in
the
best
terms
and
having
a
great
consideration
for
his
respectable
character
he
will
have
a
great
joy
to
see
you
again
and
i
should
be
very
happy
if
i
could
enjoy
the
same
pleasure
an
affectionate
interest
for
one
another
and
one
another
families
appears
in
all
these
letters
as
well
as
a
cherishing
of
common
souvenirs
rochambeau
asks
to
be
remembered
to
his
former
american
comrades
a
thousand
kindness
es
and
compliments
to
jefferson
to
knox
and
to
all
my
and
friends
which
are
near
you
the
countess
de
rochambeau
sometimes
takes
up
the
pen
and
in
one
of
her
letters
appeals
to
washington
in
favor
of
dear
closen
who
though
he
had
every
right
to
be
included
in
it
had
been
forgotten
when
the
list
of
the
original
cincinnati
had
been
drawn
up
the
request
was
at
once
granted
two
had
been
painted
by
the
famous
miniaturist
van
blarenberghe
one
representing
the
storming
of
the
redoubts
at
yorktown
the
other
the
surrender
of
the
garrison
they
were
for
the
king
and
are
well
known
nowadays
to
every
one
familiar
with
the
versailles
museum
their
topographical
accuracy
is
so
remarkable
that
it
had
always
been
believed
the
painter
had
had
the
help
of
some
french
officer
present
at
the
siege
rochambeau
writes
to
washington
about
those
pictures
and
gives
us
the
name
of
the
officer
who
had
actually
helped
the
miniaturist
a
name
that
of
berthier
there
have
been
presented
yesterday
to
the
king
my
dear
general
two
pictures
to
put
in
his
closet
study
which
have
been
done
by
an
excellent
painter
one
representing
the
siege
of
york
and
the
other
the
defile
of
the
british
army
between
the
american
and
the
french
armies
le
marshal
de
ségur
promised
me
copies
of
them
which
i
will
place
in
my
closet
on
the
right
and
left
sides
of
your
picture
besides
that
they
are
excellent
paintings
they
have
been
drawn
both
by
the
truth
and
by
an
excellent
design
by
the
young
berthier
who
was
deputed
quartermaster
at
the
said
siege
washington
having
alluded
as
he
was
fond
of
doing
to
the
rest
he
had
at
last
secured
for
the
remnant
of
his
life
as
he
thought
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
vine
and
rochambeau
in
his
answer
courteously
and
sincerely
compliments
him
on
the
philosophical
but
not
definitive
quiet
he
now
enjoys
under
the
shadow
of
his
the
war
of
the
austrian
succession
had
found
rochambeau
already
an
officer
in
the
french
army
the
revolution
found
him
still
an
officer
in
the
french
army
defending
the
frontier
as
a
marshal
of
france
and
of
the
northern
troops
in
he
definitively
withdrew
to
rochambeau
barely
escaping
with
his
life
during
the
terror
a
striking
and
touching
thing
it
is
to
note
that
when
a
prisoner
in
that
horrible
sepulchre
the
conciergerie
he
appealed
to
the
citizen
president
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
and
invoked
as
a
safeguard
the
great
name
of
washington
my
colleague
and
my
friend
in
the
war
we
made
together
for
the
liberty
of
america
luckier
than
many
of
his
companions
in
arms
of
the
american
war
than
lauzun
custine
broglie
dillon
and
others
rochambeau
escaped
the
scaffold
he
lived
long
enough
to
see
rise
to
glory
that
young
man
who
was
teaching
the
world
better
military
tactics
than
even
the
book
of
count
de
guibert
bonaparte
now
first
consul
of
the
french
republic
bonaparte
had
great
respect
for
the
old
marshal
who
was
presented
to
him
by
the
minister
of
war
in
he
received
him
surrounded
by
his
generals
and
as
the
soldier
of
klostercamp
and
yorktown
entered
he
said
monsieur
le
maréchal
here
are
your
pupils
and
the
old
man
answered
they
have
surpassed
their
master
after
having
been
very
near
death
from
his
wounds
in
rochambeau
died
only
in
being
then
in
his
castle
of
rochambeau
in
vendomois
and
aged
he
was
buried
in
the
neighboring
village
of
thoré
in
a
tomb
of
black
and
white
marble
in
the
classical
style
then
in
vogue
an
inscription
devised
by
his
wife
at
the
evening
of
a
very
long
life
draws
a
touching
picture
of
those
qualities
which
had
won
her
heart
more
than
half
a
century
before
a
model
as
admirable
in
his
family
as
in
his
armies
an
enlightened
mind
indulgent
ever
thinking
of
the
interests
of
others
a
happy
and
honored
old
age
has
been
for
him
the
crowning
of
a
spotless
life
those
who
had
been
his
vassals
had
become
his
children
his
tomb
awaits
me
before
descending
to
it
i
have
desired
to
engrave
upon
it
the
memory
of
so
many
merits
and
virtues
as
a
token
of
gratitude
for
fifty
years
of
happiness
on
a
parallel
slab
one
reads
here
lies
jeanne
thérèse
telles
who
died
at
rochambeau
aged
may
in
the
castle
are
still
to
be
seen
the
exquisite
portrait
by
latour
of
her
who
in
her
old
age
had
written
the
inscription
several
portraits
of
the
marshal
and
of
his
ancestors
from
the
first
vimeur
who
had
become
in
the
sixteenth
century

mentioned
in

but
the

by
congress
are
no
longer
there
having
been
commandeered
during
the
revolution
in
front
of
the
simple
and
noble
façade
of
the
castle
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
the
loir
flows
brimful
between
woods
and
meadows
the
same
river
that
fills
such
a
great
place
in
french
literature
because
of
a
distant
relative
of
the
rochambeaus
of
old
pierre
de
ronsard
visiting
some
years
ago
the
place
and
the
tomb
and
standing
beside
the
grave
of
the
marshal
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
appropriate
if
some
day
trees
from
mount
vernon
could
spread
their
shade
over
the
remains
of
that
friend
of
washington
and
the
american
cause
with
the
assent
of
the
family
and
of
the
mayor
of
thoré
and
thanks
to
the
good
will
of
the
ladies
of
the
mount
vernon
association
this
idea
was
realized
and
half
a
dozen
seedlings
from
trees
planted
by
washington
were
sent
to
be
placed
around
rochambeau
monument
two
elms
two
maples
two
redbuds
and
six
plants
of
ivy
from
washington
tomb
the
last
news
received
about
them
showed
that
they
had
taken
root
and
were
growing
x
some
will
perhaps
desire
to
know
what
became
of
closen
sent
to
the
islands
the
west
indies
with
the
rest
of
the
army
he
felt
like
all
his
comrades
greatly
disappointed
more
even
than
the
others
on
account
of
his
bride
whom
american
beauties
had
not
caused
him
to
forget
he
had
inserted
in
his
journal
a
page
of
silhouettes
representing
a
dozen
of
the
latter
with
the
name
inscribed
on
each
but
he
had
taken
care
to
write
underneath
honni
soit
qui
mal
y
pense
when
about
to
go
on
board
he
writes
i
scarcely
dare
say
what
i
experienced
and
which
was
the
dominating
sentiment
whether
my
attachment
to
all
that
i
love
or
ambition
added
to
sensitiveness
on
the
principles
of
honor
reason
however
soon
took
the
lead
and
decided
in
favor
of
the
latter
let
me
be
patient
and
do
my
duty
to
leave
rochambeau
was
for
him
one
more
cause
of
pain
i
shall
never
insist
enough
nor
sufficiently
describe
the
sorrow
i
felt
when
separated
from
my
worthy
and
respectable
general
i
lose
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
army
attentive
as
i
was
to
all
he
had
to
say
about
battles
marches
the
selection
of
positions
sieges
in
a
word
to
all
that
pertains
to
the
profession
i
have
always
tried
to
profit
by
his
so
instructive
talks
i
must
be
resigned
once
again
therefore
life
begins
on
those
detested
sabots
a
this
time
namely
the
of
guns
quite
recently
lined
with
copper
a
sad
place
of
abode
however
in
bad
weather
or
even
in
any
weather
one
can
scarcely
imagine
the
bigness
of
the
sea
the
noise
the
height
of
the
waves
such
pitching
and
rolling
that
it
was
impossible
to
stand
the
ships
disappearing
at
times
as
if
they
had
been
swallowed
by
the
sea
to
touch
it
the
instant
after
only
with
a
tiny
bit
of
the
keel
what
a
nasty
element
and
how
sincerely
we
hate
it
all
of
us
of
the
land
troops
the
lugubrious
noise
of
the
masts
the
of
the
vessel
the
terrible
movements
which
on
the
sudden
raise
you
and
to
which
we
were
not
at
all
accustomed
the
perpetual
encumbrance
that
officers
are
for
each
other
forty
having
no
other
place
of
refuge
than
a
single
room
for
them
all
the
sad
faces
of
those
who
are
sick
the
dirt
the
boredom
the
feeling
that
one
is
shut
up
in
a
as
in
a
state
prison
all
this
is
only
part
of
what
goes
to
make
life
unpleasant
for
a
land
officer
on
a
vessel
even
a
naval
one
let
us
take
courage
few
diversions
they
meet
a
under
the
austrian
flag
an
abominable
and
cruel
sight
with
that
iron
chain
running
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
the
negroes
being
tied
there
two
and
two
stark
naked
and
harshly
beaten
if
they
make
any
movement
which
displeases

where

is
however
too
much
fanaticism
too
many
absurd

too
much
ignorance
among
the
inhabitants
who
can
never
say
a
word
or
walk
a
step
without
saying
an
crossing
themselves
twenty
times
or
kissing

which
they
ever
have
dangling
from
their
neck
with
a
somewhat
considerable
accompaniment
of
relics
and
crosses
one
gentleman
in
order
to
play
a
trick
on
me
in
the
private
houses
where
i
had
gained
access
so
as
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
and
desire
of
instruction
told
a
few
people
that
i
was
a
protestant
what
signs
of
the
cross
at
the
news
and
they
would
ceaselessly
repeat
a
bad
christian
on
the
of
march
great
news
reached
them
the
french
vessel
arrived
with
the
grand
white
flag
on
her
foremast
as
a
signal
of
peace
the
minute
after
all
our
were
decked
with
flags
there
were
a
few
more
incidents
like
the
capture
of
some
french
officers
who
were
quietly
rowing
in
open
boats
by
the
of
guns
commanded
by
captain
nelson
of
whom
these
gentlemen
speak
in
the
highest
terms
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
peace
was
given
him
they
were
released
by
the
future
enemy
of
napoleon
the
hour
for
the
return
home
had
struck
at
last
it
was
delayed
by
brief
stays
in
some
parts
of
the
french
west
indies
notably
cap
français
santo
domingo
now
cap
haïtien
a
few
days
before
our
arrival
at
the
cape
prince
william
duke
of
lancaster
third
son
of
the
king
of
england
had
come
and
spent
there
two
days
while
the
english
squadron
was
cruising
in
the
roads
great
festivities
had
been
arranged
in
his
honor
for
there
was
really
no
hatred
against
the
enemy
of
the
day
before
some
calms
and
some
storms
also
delayed
the
return
with
the
usual
criiiiicks
craaaaaks
of
the
masts
the
journey
being
occupied
in
transcribing
the
notes
and
journals
on
the
two
americas
and
enlivened
by
the
saving
of
the
parrakeet
of
a
spanish
lady
who
had
been
admitted
with
her
family
on
board
the
frightened
by
something
the
little
parrakeet
flies
off
and
falls
into
the
sea
the
lady
negro
luckily
happening
to
be
on
the
same
side
jumps
just
as
he
is
with
no
time
to
think
dives
reappears
cries
cato
joins
the
parrakeet
puts
her
on
his
woolly
head
and
returns
to
the
ship
delighted
the
lady
allows
this
black
saviour
to
kiss
her
hand
a
unique
distinction
for
a
slave
and
bestows
on
him
a
life
pension
of
one
hundred
francs
many
sailors
would
have
liked
to
do
the
same
had
they
known
land
is
now
descried
they
see
again
the
sights
noted
when
sailing
for
america
these
coasts
with
live
people
and
other
delightful
objects
all
is
delightful
the
joy
is
universal
they
make
arrangements
to
reach
paris
which
closen
did
in
magnificent
style
and
i
we
read
in
his
journal
after
having
bought
a
fine
coach
where
i
could
place
before
behind
on
the
top
my
servants
consisting
of
a
white
man
and
of
my
faithful
and
superb
black
peter
and
with
them
three
monkeys
four
parrots
and
six
parrakeets
posted
to
paris
in
this
company
a
noisy
one
and
difficult
to
maintain
clean
and
in
good
order
the
next
day
june
i
was
at
my
last
quarters
before
sailing
for
america
and
saw
again
with
hearty
rejoicings
the
respectable
kersabiec
family
which
had
so
well
tended
me
throughout
my
convalescence
after
a
deadly
disease
he
thought
he
could
do
no
less
than
present
them
with
one
of
his
parrakeets
as
a
token
of
gratitude
and
friendship
at
guingamp
he
finds
the
du
dresnays
other
friends
of
his
and
reaches
paris
he
writes
on
the
of
june
with
all
my
live
beings
of
all
colors
myself
looking
an
indian
so
tanned
and
was
my
face
exception
made
for
my
forehead
which
my
hat
had
preserved
quite
white
the
rochambeau
family
made
him
leave
his
inn
and
stay
with
them
in
their
beautiful
house
of
the
rue
du
the
general
my
kind
and
respectable
military
father
says
closen
presented
him
to
the
minister
of
war
marshal
de
ségur
who
granted
the
young
officer
a
flattering
welcome
and
the
journal
closes
as
novels
used
to
end
in
olden
days
and
as
the
first
part
of
happy
lives
will
ever
continue
to
end
leaving
paris
with
the
promise
of
a
colonelcy
a
very
eventual
ministerial
bouquet
he
went
home
to
there
i
found
my
beautiful
fiancée
my
dear
my
divine
doris
who
had
had
the
constancy
to
keep
for
me
her
heart
and
her
hand
during
the
four
years
of
my
absence
in
america
in
spite
of
several
proposals
received
by
her
even
from
men
much
better
endowed
with
worldly
goods
my
share
consisting
only
in
the
before
mentioned
ministerial
promise
and
in
the
reputation
of
an
honest
man
and
a
good
soldier
i
shall
only
add
that
the
ministerial
promise
was
kept
and
that
it
was
as
a
colonel
and
a
knight
of
saint
louis
that
closen
found
himself
again
to
his
old
chief
rochambeau
charged
with
the
defense
of
the
northern
frontier
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
faded
inks
hushed
voices
the
remembrance
of
the
work
remains
however
and
can
not
fade
for
its
grandeur
becomes
from
year
to
year
more
apparent
in
less
than
a
century
and
a
half
new
york
has
passed
from
the
ten
thousand
inhabitants
it
possessed
under
clinton
to
the
five
million
and
more
of
philadelphia
once
the
chief
city
an
immense
town
closen
had
called
it
has
now
ten
times
more
houses
than
it
had
citizens
partly
owing
again
to

ceding

refused

was

in

hostile

vanished

have

in

as
a
reason
that
whenever
the

should
come
to
treat
his
most
christian
majesty
would
show
how
much
the
engagements
he
might
enter
into
were
to
be
relied
on
by
his
exact
observance
of
those
he

capitol
of
the

and
the
ground
around
it
were
covered
with
woods
and
underbrush
a
few
scattered
farms
had
been
built
here
and
there
with
one
or
two
exceptions
mere
wooden
structures
whose
low
roofs
scarcely
emerged
from
their
leafy
surroundings
not
very
long
before
indians
had
used
to
gather
on
that
eminence
and
hold
their
as
far
now
as
the

the
choice
made
by
the
great
man
whose
name
the
city
was
to
bear
the
talents
of
a
french
officer
caused
this
change
debates
and
competitions
had
been
very
keen
more
than
one
city
of
the
north
and
of
the
south
had
put
forth
pleas
to
be
the
one
selected
and
become
the
capital

fired

had

where
it
had
been
won
yorktown
modest
as
a
city
but
glorious
by
the
events
its
name
recalled
now
an
borough
rarely
visited
and
where
fifty
white
inhabitants
are
all

people
the
capital
of

new

also
had
been
in
the
ranks
as
well
as
kingston
newport
wilmington
trenton
reading
lancaster
annapolis
williamsburg
and
several
others
passions
were
stirred
to
such
an
extent
that
the
worst
was
feared
and
that
incredible
as
it
may
now
seem
jefferson
could
speak
of
the
necessity
of
a
compromise
to
save
the
union
a
compromise
was
in
fact
resorted
to
which
consisted
in
choosing
no
city
already
in
existence
but
building
a
new
one
on
purpose
this
solution
had
been
early
thought
of
for
washington
had
written
on
october
to
chevalier
de
chastellux
they
congress
have
lately
determined
to
make
choice
of
some
convenient
spot
near
the
falls
of
the
delaware
for
the
permanent
residence
of
the
sovereign
power
of
these
united
states
but
capitals
still
persisted
in
hoping
they
might
be
selected
congress
made
up
its
mind
for
good
on
the
of
july
and
decided
that
the
president
should
be
intrusted
with
the
care
of
choosing
on
the
river
potomac
a
territory
ten
miles
square
which
should
become
the
federal
territory
and
the
permanent
seat
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
washington
thereupon
quickly
reached
a
decision
a
great
rider
all
his
life
the
hills
and
vales
of
the
region
were
familiar
to
him
it
soon
became
certain
that
the
federal
city
would
rise
one
day
where
it
now
stands
the
spot
seemed
to
him
a
particularly
appropriate
one
for
a
reason
which
has
long
ceased
to
be
so
very
telling
and
which
he
constantly
mentions
in
his
letters
as
the
place
centrality
but
what
sort
of
a
city
should
it
be
a
residential
one
for
statesmen
legislators
and
judges
or
a
commercial
one
with
the
possibilities
considered
then
of
the
first
order
afforded
by
the
river
or
a
mixture
of
both
should
it
be
planned
in
view
of
the
present
or
of
the
future
and
of
what
sort
of
future
with
the
mind
of
an
artist
and
in
some
sense
of
a
prophet
perceiving
future
time
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
the
present
a
man
foresaw
over
a
century
ago
what
we
now
see
with
our
eyes
he
was
a
french
officer
who
had
fought
for
the
cause
of
independence
and
had
remained
in
america
after
the
war
major
pierre
charles
some
researches
in
french
and
american
archives
have
allowed
me
to
trace
his
ancestry
and
to
add
a
few
particulars
to
what
was
already
known
of
him
born
at
paris
on
august
he
was
the
son
of
pierre
painter
in
ordinary
to
the
king
in
his
manufacture
of
the
gobelins
the
painter
whose
wife
was
marie
charlotte
leullier
had
for
his
specialty
landscapes
and
born
at
anet
in
on
a
farm
which
he
bequeathed
to
his
children
he
was
a
pupil
of
parrocel
and
had
been
elected
an
academician
in
some
of
his
pictures
are
at
tours
six
are
at
versailles
representing
as
many
french
victories
the
taking
of
menin
of
fribourg
of
tournay
the
battle
of
fontenoy
a
favorite
subject
several
times
painted
by
him
the
battle
of
laufeldt
where
that
young
officer
destined
to
be
washington
partner
in
the
yorktown
campaign
count
rochambeau
received
as
we
have
seen
before
his
first
wounds
the
painter
died
a
very
old
man
in
the
royal
manufacture
young
grew
up
among
artistic
surroundings
and
as
subsequent
events
showed
received
instruction
as
an
architect
and
engineer
the
cause
of
the
united
states
had
in
him
one
of
its
earliest
enthusiasts
in
being
then
possessed
of
a
commission
of
lieutenant
in
the
french
colonial
troops
he
sailed
for
america
on
one
of
those
ships
belonging
to
beaumarchais
mythical
firm
of
hortalez
and
a
firm
whose
cargoes
consisted
in
soldiers
and
ammunition
for
the
insurgents
and
which
was
as
much
a
product
of
the
dramatist
brain
as
figaro
himself
figaro
it
is
averred
has
had
a
great
influence
in
this
world
hortalez
and
had
not
a
small
one
either
the
ship
had
been
named
after
the
secretary
of
state
who
was
to
sign
the
following
year
the
united
states
only
alliance
comte
de
a
name
wrote
beaumarchais
fit
to
bring
luck
to
the
cargo
which
is
superb
the
superb
cargo
consisted
as
usual
in
guns
and
war
supplies
also
in
men
who
might
be
of
no
less
use
for
the
particular
sort
of
trade
hortalez
and
were
conducting
some
good
engineers
and
some
cavalry
officers
will
soon
arrive
silas
deane
was
then
writing
to
congress
one
of
the
engineers
was
pierre
charles
his
coming
had
preceded
by
one
month
the
sailing
of
another
ship
with
another
appropriate
name
the
ship
which
brought
lafayette
served
first
as
a
volunteer
and
at
his
own
expense
in
february
we
read
in
an
unpublished
letter
of
his
to
washington
i
was
honored
with
a
commission
of
captain
of
engineers
and
by
leave
of
congress
attached
to
the
seeing
after
the
winter
of
no
appearance
of
an
active
campaign
to
the
northward
my
whole
ambition
was
to
attend
the
southern
army
where
it
was
likely
the
seat
of
war
would
be
transferred
he
was
accordingly
sent
to
charleston
and
obtained
leave
to
join
the
light
infantry
under
laurens
his
friendship
furnished
me
he
relates
with
many
opportunities
of
seeing
the
enemy
to
advantage
not
to
advantage
however
did
he
fight
at
savannah
when
the
french
and
americans
under
and
lincoln
were
repulsed
with
terrible
loss
the
young
captain
was
leading
one
of
the
vanguard
columns
in
the
american
contingent
and
like
himself
was
grievously
wounded
he
managed
to
escape
to
charleston
i
was
he
said
in
my
bed
till
january
my
weak
state
of
health
did
not
permit
me
to
work
at
the
fortifications
of
charleston
and
when
the
enemy
debarked
i
was
still
obliged
to
use
a
crutch
he
took
part
however
in
the
fight
replacing
a
wounded
major
and
was
made
a
prisoner
at
the
capitulation
rochambeau
negotiated
his
exchange
in
january
for
captain
von
heyden
a
hessian
officer
your
zeal
and
active
services
washington
wrote
back
to
are
such
as
reflect
the
highest
honor
on
yourself
and
are
extremely
pleasing
to
me
and
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
have
their
due
weight
with
congress
in
any
future
promotion
in
your
corps
they
had
in
fact
in
the
following
year
when
by
a
vote
of
the
assembly
was
promoted
a
major
of
engineers
his
knowledge
of
the
art
of
fortification
his
merit
as
a
disciplinarian
the
part
he
had
taken
as
he
recalls
in
a
letter
to
count
de
la
luzerne
in
devising
the
earliest
system
of
discipline
and
exercises
which
was
finally
adopted
in
the
american
army
all
that
was
done
in
that
line
was
not
by
steuben
alone
rendered
his
services
quite
useful
his
gifts
as
an
artist
his
cleverness
at
catching
likenesses
made
him
welcome
among
his
brother
officers
he
would
in
the
dreary
days
of
valley
forge
draw
pencil
portraits
of
them
one
we
know
of
washington
at
the
request
of
lafayette
who
wanted
also
to
have
a
painted
portrait
i
misunderstood
you
the
general
wrote
him
from
fredericksburg
on
september
else
i
would
have
had
the
picture
made
by
peale
when
he
was
at
valley
forge
when
you
requested
me
to
sit
to
monsieur
lanfang
thus
spelled
showing
how
pronounced
by
washington
i
thought
it
was
only
to
obtain
the
outlines
and
a
few
shades
of
my
features
to
have
some
prints
struck
from
some
such
pencil
portraits
by
subsist
for
example
in
the
glover
family
at
washington
and
are
creditable
and
obviously
sketches
whenever
during
the
war
or
after
something
in
any
way
connected
with
art
was
wanted
was
as
a
matter
of
course
appealed
to
whether
the
question
was
of
a
portrait
of
a
banqueting
hall
of
a
marble
palace
a
jewel
a
solemn
procession
a
fortress
to
be
raised
or
a
city
to
be
planned
a
man
of
many
accomplishments
with
an
overflow
of
ideas
and
few
competitors
he
was
the
factotum
of
the
new
nation
when
the
french
minister
la
luzerne
desired
to
arrange
a
grand
banquet
in
honor
of
the
birth
of
the
dauphin
the
first
one
who
lived
only
eight
years
he
had
a
hall
built
on
purpose
in
philadelphia
and
was
the
designer
baron
de
closen
rochambeau
aide
writes
as
to
this
in
his
journal
de
la
luzerne
offered
a
dinner
that
day
to
the
legion
of
lauzun
which
had
arrived
the
same
morning
august
the
hall
which
he
caused
to
be
built
on
purpose
for
the
fête
he
gave
on
the
occasion
of
the
birth
of
the
dauphin
is
very
large
and
as
beautiful
as
it
can
be
one
can
not
imagine
a
building
in
better
taste
simplicity
is
there
united
with
an
air
of
dignity
it
has
been
erected
under
the
direction
of
de
a
french
officer
in
the
service
of
the
american
corps
of
engineers
closen
adds
that
barbé
de
marbois
counselor
of
embassy
of
our
court
is
too
modest
to
admit
that
his
advice
had
something
to
do
with
the
result
when
peace
came
those
officers
who
had
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
americans
returned
home
bringing
to
the
old
continent
new
and
fruitful
ideas
those
especially
pertaining
to
equality
and
to
the
unreasonableness
of
class
distinctions
liberty
had
been
learned
from
england
equality
was
from
america
was
one
of
those
who
went
back
to
france
but
he
did
not
stay
he
had
been
away
five
years
and
wanted
to
see
his
old
father
the
painter
whose
end
now
was
near
a
royal
brevet
of
june
had
conferred
on
the
officer
a
small
french
pension
of
three
hundred
livres
in
consideration
of
the
usefulness
of
his
services
and
of
the
wounds
received
by
him
during
the
american
war
he
sailed
for
france
late
in
the
same
year
reaching
havre
on
the
of
december
the
society
of
the
cincinnati
had
been
founded
in
may
for
the
insignia
appeal
had
been
made
as
usual
to
the
artist
of
the
army
who
was
moreover
commissioned
by
washington
first
president
of
the
association
to
avail
himself
of
his
journey
to
order
from
some
good
paris
jeweller
the
eagles
to
be
worn
by
the
members
himself
being
one
he
was
also
to
help
in
organizing
the
french
branch
of
the
society
difficulties
had
first
been
encountered
for
the
reason
that
no
foreign
order
was
then
allowed
in
france
but
it
was
recognized
that
this
could
scarcely
be
considered
a
foreign
one
in
an
unpublished
letter
to
rochambeau
marshal
de
ségur
minister
of
war
said
his
majesty
the
king
asks
me
to
inform
you
that
he
allows
you
to
accept
this
honorable
invitation
to
be
a
member
he
even
wants
you
to
assure
general
washington
in
his
behalf
that
he
will
always
see
with
extreme
satisfaction
all
that
may
lead
to
a
maintenance
and
strengthening
of
the
ties
formed
between
france
and
the
united
states
the
successes
and
the
glory
which
have
been
the
result
and
fruit
of
this
union
have
shown
how
advantageous
it
is
and
that
it
should
be
perpetuated
concerning
the
institution
itself
the
minister
wrote
it
is
equally
honorable
because
of
the
spirit
which
has
inspired
its
creation
and
of
the
virtues
and
talents
of
the
celebrated
general
whom
it
has
chosen
as
its
president
sent
to
washington
glowing
accounts
of
the
way
the
idea
had
been
welcomed
in
france
and
told
him
of
the
first
meetings
held
one
at
the
house
of
rochambeau
rue
du
for
officers
in
the
french
service
and
another
at
the
house
of
lafayette
rue
de
bourbon
for
french
officers
who
held
their
commissions
from
congress
both
groups
deciding
thereupon
to
unite
under
admiral
as
what
proved
for
according
to
circumstances
one
of
his
chief
qualities
as
well
as
one
of
his
chief
defects
was
that
whatever
the
occasion
he
ever
saw
en
grand
it
had
been
understood
that
he
would
pay
the
expenses
of
his
journey
and
that
the
society
of
the
cincinnati
would
only
take
charge
of
those
resulting
from
the
making
of
the
eagles
his
own
modest
resources
had
been
as
duportail
testified
freely
spent
by
him
during
the
war
for
the
good
of
the
cause
and
little
enough
was
left
him
nevertheless
did
he
write
to
alexander
hamilton
being
arrived
in
france
everything
there
concurred
to
strengthen
the
sentiment
which
had
made
me
undertake
that
voyage
and
the
reception
which
the
cincinnati
met
with
soon
induced
me
to
appear
in
that
country
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
the
society
of
which
i
was
regarded
as
the
representative
he
spent
without
counting
my
abode
at
the
court
produced
expenses
far
beyond
the
sums
i
had
at
first
thought
of
he
ordered
the
eagles
from
the
best
artists
who
rivalled
each
other
for
the
honor
of
working
for
the
society
but
wanted
however
to
be
paid
and
a
letter
to
rochambeau
written
later
shows
him
grappling
with
the
problem
of
satisfying
duval
and
francastel
of
paris
who
had
supplied
the
eagles
on
credit
and
to
whom
the
large
sum
of
thousand
three
hundred
and
three
livres
were
still
due
these
money
troubles
caused
to
shorten
his
stay
in
france
he
was
back
in
new
york
on
the
of
april
and
after
some
discussion
and
delay
the
society
resolved
that
in
consideration
of
services
rendered
by
major
the
general
meeting
make
arrangements
for
advancing
him
the
sum
of
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
dollars
being
the
amount
of
the
loss
incurred
by
him
in
the
negotiation
for
a
number
of
eagles
or
orders
of
the
cincinnati
ii
the
country
was
free
war
was
over
now
people
felt
for
ever
many
fondly
hoped
settled
in
new
york
where
appeals
to
his
talents
as
an
architect
and
engineer
made
him
prosperous
for
a
time
believed
such
hopes
to
be
vain
and
that
the
country
should
at
once
make
preparations
so
exhaustive
that
its
wealth
and
defenselessness
should
not
tempt
any
greedy
enemy
he
placed
the
problem
before
congress
in
a
memoir
still
unprinted
which
offers
particular
interest
in
our
days
when
the
same
problem
is
being
again
discussed
sensible
wrote
in
the
creditable
if
not
faultless
english
he
then
spoke
of
the
situation
of
affairs
and
well
impregnated
with
the
spirit
of
republican
government
i
am
far
from
intimating
the
idea
of
following
other
nations
in
their
way
of
securing
themselves
against
insult
or
invasions
surrounded
as
they
are
with
powerful
neighbors
who
being
the
objects
of
reciprocal
jealousy
are
forced
to
secure
not
only
their
frontier
but
even
their
inland
towns
with
fortifications
the
much
happier
situation
of
the
united
states
rendering
those
measures
of
little
or
no
necessity
the
states
must
act
differently
but
not
to
act
at
all
would
be
folly
how
and
upon
what
foundations
could
it
be
supposed
that
america
will
have
nothing
to
fear
from
a
rupture
between
any
of
the
european
powers
a
neutral
power
it
will
be
said
receives
the
benefit
of
a
universal
trade
has
his
possessions
respected
as
well
as
his
colors
by
all
the
powers
at
war
this
may
be
said
of
a
powerful
nation
but
this
america
is
not
to
expect
a
neutral
power
must
be
ready
for
war
and
his
trade
depends
on
the
means
of
protecting
and
making
his
colors
respected
america
neutral
without
a
navy
without
troops
or
fortified
harbors
could
have
nothing
but
calamity
to
expect
she
can
not
live
free
and
develop
in
safety
without
power
to
resent
ability
to
protect
a
noteworthy
statement
to
be
sure
and
which
deserves
to
be
remembered
draws
thereupon
a
plan
of
defense
especially
insisting
of
course
on
the
importance
of
his
own
particular
branch
namely
engineering
houdon
brief
visit
shortly
after
in
order
to
make
statue
for
the
state
of
virginia
must
have
been
particularly
pleasant
to
the
major
to
whom
the
great
sculptor
could
bring
news
of
his
the
old
painter
of
the
gobelins
manufacture
father
of
the
officer
an
unprinted
letter
of
to
the
secretary
of
congress
sitting
then
in
new
york
gives
a
number
of
details
on
houdon
stay
in
america
the
federal
congress
had
thought
of
ordering
in
its
turn
a
statue
of
washington
which
would
have
been
an
equestrian
one
but
what
would
the
cost
be
a
most
important
question
in
those
days
on
behalf
of
houdon
who
knew
no
english
wrote
to
charles
thomson
that
houdon
could
not
properly
hazard
to
give
him
any
answer
relating
to
the
cost
of
the
general
equestrian
statue
there
are
a
great
many
ways
of
making
such
work
and
congress
must
say
which
it
prefers
a
book
belonging
to
houdon
will
shortly
reach
these
shores
where
particulars
as
to
the
performance
of
the
several
statues
which
have
been
created
in
europe
are
mentioned
together
with
their
cost
the
book
is
on
a
vessel
soon
expected
and
which
brings
back
doctor
franklin
bagage
congress
had
thought
also
of
a
marble
bust
for
the
hall
where
it
sat
houdon
was
taking
home
with
him
a
finished
model
of
the
head
of
the
great
man
and
had
exhibited
it
for
every
one
to
say
his
say
in
the
room
of
congress
such
busts
wrote
are
generally
paid
in
europe
five
thousand
french
livres
but
as
many
duplicates
will
probably
be
ordered
from
him
houdon
will
lower
the
price
to
one
hundred
guineas
he
begs
leave
however
to
observe
that
a
bust
of
the
size
of
nature
only
may
be
fit
for
a
private
and
small
room
but
not
for
such
a
large
one
as
that
devoted
for
the
assembly
of
a
congress
where
it
should
be
necessary
to
have
a
bust
of
a
larger
size
to
have
it
appear
to
advantage
the
price
had
been
asked
too
of
duplicates
in
plaster
of
paris
for
private
citizens
the
answer
was
four
guineas
also
in
the
thought
that
a
goodly
number
would
be
wanted
provided
that
there
be
a
subscription
for
a
large
number
and
that
the
gentlemen
who
will
have
any
of
these
busts
in
their
possession
consider
themselves
as
engaged
to
prevent
any
copy
from
being
taken
this
last
condition
he
humbly
insists
upon
as
for
the
original
houdon
is
anxious
to
know
what
the
compatriots
of
the
general
think
of
it
any
criticism
would
be
welcome
houdon
hopes
that
congress
is
satisfied
with
the
bust
he
has
had
the
honor
to
submit
to
their
examination
begs
the
gentlemen
who
may
have
some
objections
to
communicate
them
to
him
and
he
flatters
himself
that
congress
will
favor
him
with
their
opinion
in
writing
which
he
will
consider
as
a
proof
of
their
satisfaction
and
keep
as
a
testimony
of
their
goodness
he
is
just
about
to
sail
and
the
bust
has
to
be
removed
at
once
houdon
being
to
embark
morning
begs
leave
to
take
out
the
general
bust
from
the
room
of
congress
this
afternoon
chief
work
in
new
york
consisted
in
the
remodelling
of
the
old
or
rather
older
but
not
oldest
city
hall
the
one
which
preceded
that
now
known
in
its
turn
as
the
old
one
the
undertaking
was
of
importance
the
question
being
of
better
accommodating
congress
which
had
left
philadelphia
with
a
grudge
toward
that
city
and
was
now
sitting
in
new
york
a
large
sum
for
those
days
had
been
advanced
by
patriotic
citizens
which
sum
however
habit
to
see
things
en
grand
caused
to
be
insufficient
by
more
than
half
the
city
hoped
that
the
devising
of
such
a
structure
would
be
for
it
one
more
title
to
be
selected
as
the
federal
capital
and
it
therefore
did
not
protest
but
on
the
contrary
caused
a
testimonial
to
be
officially
presented
to
highly
praising
his
work
while
the
hall
exists
it
will
exhibit
a
most
respectable
monument
of
your
eminent
talents
as
well
as
of
the
munificence
of
the
citizens
received
the
freedom
of
the
city
by
special
honorifick
patent
as
he
wrote
later
and
he
was
moreover
offered
ten
acres
of
land
near
provost
lane
which
latter
he
politely
declined
the
building
won
general
admiration
for
its
noble
appearance
the
tasteful
brilliancy
of
its
ornamentation
and
its
commodious
internal
arrangements
the
only
objections
came
from
the
who
called
it
the
fools
trap
in
which
appellation
politics
had
obviously
more
to
do
than
architecture
a
man
of
ideas
had
tried
to
make
of
the
renovated
hall
something
characteristically
american
if
not
in
the
general
style
which
was
classical
at
least
in
many
details
national
resources
had
been
turned
into
use
in
the
senate
chamber
the
chimneys
were
of
american
marble
which
for
beauties
of
shade
and
polish
is
equal
to
any
of
its
kind
in
europe
the
capitals
of
the
pilasters
were
of
a
fanciful
kind
the
invention
of
major
the
architect
amidst
their
foliage
appears
a
star
and
rays
and
a
piece
of
drapery
below
suspends
a
small
medallion
with
in
a
cipher
the
idea
is
new
and
the
effect
pleasing
and
although
they
can
not
be
said
to
be
of
any
ancient
order
we
must
allow
that
they
have
an
appearance
of
magnificence
the
frieze
outside
was
so
divided
as
to
give
room
for
thirteen
stars
in
so
many
metopes
a
eagle
with
thirteen
arrows
in
its
talons
which
unluckily
could
not
be
ready
for
march
when
congress
met
in
the
hail
for
the
first
time
under
the
newly
voted
constitution
was
the
chief
ornament
on
the
pediment
on
the
of
april
the
news
could
be
sent
to
the
the
eagle
in
front
of
the
federal
is
displayed
the
general
appearance
of
this
front
is
truly
august
the
emblem
was
thus
at
its
proper
place
when
the
chief
event
that
federal
hall
as
it
was
then
called
was
to
witness
occurred
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
day
of
the
first
inauguration
of
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
crowds
came
to
visit
what
was
then
the
most
beautiful
building
in
the
country
but
better
than
crowds
came
and
one
visit
was
for
the
major
more
touching
and
flattering
than
all
the
others
put
together
the
wife
of
his
general
now
the
president
washington
caused
colonel
humphreys
and
lear
to
make
arrangements
with
for
her
to
inspect
the
hall
in
june
of
the
inauguration
year
the
expensive
and
greatly
admired
monument
was
to
experience
the
strange
fate
of
being
survived
by
its
author
becoming
again
city
hall
when
congress
soon
after
left
new
york
to
go
back
reconciled
to
philadelphia
it
was
pulled
down
in
the
building
itself
being
sold
at
auction
for
four
hundred
and
dollars
and
thus
disappeared
to
the
regret
of
all
lovers
of
ancient
souvenirs
the
beautiful
chimneys
in
american
marble
the
truly
august
eagle
with
its
thirteen
arrows
and
the
first
really
american
capitals
ever
devised
and
which
though
in
a
new
style
were
yet
magnificent
one
solitary
souvenir
of
the
building
remains
however
that
is
the
middle
part
of
the
railing
on
which
washington
must
have
leaned
when
taking
the
oath
a
piece
of
wrought
iron
of
a
fine
ornamental
style
now
preserved
with
so
many
other
interesting
relics
of
old
new
york
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
new
york
historical
society
museum
in
the

be

shortly
before
the
inauguration
of
the
first

had
had
to
lend
his
help
for
the
devising
of
a
grand
artistic
historical
and
especially
political
procession
a
federalist
one
arranged
in
the
hope
of
influencing
public
opinion
and
securing
the
vote
of
the
constitution
by
the
state
of
new
york
this
now
revered
text
was
then
the
subject
of
ardent
criticism
famous
patriots
like
patrick
henry
had
detected
in
it
something
royalistic
which
has
long
ceased
to
be
apparent
and
were
violent
in
their
denunciation
of
this
instrument
of
tyranny
new
york
was
in
doubt
its
convention
had
met
at
poughkeepsie
in
june
and
it
seemed
as
if
an
adverse
vote
were
possible
the
procession
was
then
thought
of
it
took
place
on
monday
the
of
july
and
was
a
grand
affair
with
artillery

notwithstanding
it
was
one
of
the
hottest
days
in
july
the
chief
object
of
wonder
was
the
good
ship
presented
by
the
mounted
on
wheels
a
perfect
frigate
of
guns
with
its
crew
complete
firing
salutes
on
its
way
the
confectioners
surrounded
an
immense
federal
cake
the
judges
and
lawyers
were
followed
by
john

john
cozine
and
robert

bearing
the
new

elegantly
engrossed
on

and
ten

then
came
learned

the

university
scholars
and
among
them
noah
webster
famous
since
as
a
lexicographer
and
then
as
a
professor
and
journalist
now
admired
by
everybody
but
in
those
days
of
strife
only
by
federalists
a
mere
pedagogue
disdainfully
wrote
jefferson
later
of
very
limited
understanding
and
very
strong
prejudices
in
saying
which
he
himself
maybe
showed
some
prejudice
too
a
grand
banquet
at
which
according
to
the
york
journal
and
weekly
bullocks
were
roasted
whole
for
the
regale
of
the
guests
was
held
at
the
extreme
point
reached
by
the
procession
called
by
the
same
paper
the
parade
des
fêtes

the
president
and
members
of
congress
sat
under
a
dome
devised
by
it
was
surmounted
by
a
figure
of
fame
with
a
trumpet
proclaiming
a
new
era
and
holding
a
scroll
emblematic
of
the
three
great
epochs
of
the
war
with
this
was
greatly
admired
the
committee
we
read
in
a
note
printed
by
their
order
in
the
would
be
insensible
of
the
zeal
and
merit
of
major
were
they
to
omit
expressing
the
obligation
which
they
are
under
to
him
for
the
elegance
of
the
design
and
the
excellence
of
the
execution
of
the
pavilion
and
tables
the
whole
was
a
considerable
success
as
it
redounds
much
to
the
credit
of
the
citizens
another
paper
observes
it
ought
to
be
remarked
that
there
was
not
the
least
outrage
or
even
indecency
notwithstanding
or
people
as
supposed
spectators
included
had
collected
and
that
the
whole
company
was
dismissed
at
half
after
five
three
days
after
the
procession
the
vote
was
taken
at
poughkeepsie
and
if
influence
at
all
could
be
attributed
to
the
effect
on
public
opinion
of
the
pageant
its
organizers
must
have
felt
proud
for
in
an
assembly
of
the
constitution
was
actually
voted
by
a
majority
of
two
iii
the
same
year
in
which
the
new
york
federal
hall
had
seen
the
inauguration
of
the
first
president
the
chance
of
his
life
came
to
he
deserved
it
because
he
not
only
availed
himself
of
it
but
went
forth
to
meet
it
giving
up
his
abode
in
new
york
where
i
stood
at
the
time
he
wrote
later
able
of
commanding
whatever
business
i
liked
this
was
the
founding
of
the
federal
city
the
impression
was
a
general
one
among
the
french
that
those
insurgents
whom
they
had
helped
to
become
a
free
nation
were
to
be
a
great
one
too
leaving
england
where
he
was
a
refugee
during
our
revolution
talleyrand
decided
to
come
to
the
united
states
desirous
of
seeing
he
says
in
his
memoirs
that
great
country
whose
history
begins
general
moreau
also
a
refugee
a
few
years
later
spoke
with
the
same
confidence
of
the
future
of
the
country
i
had
pictured
to
myself
the
advantages
of
living
under
a
free
government
but
i
had
conceived
only
in
part
what
such
happiness
is
here
it
is
enjoyed
to
the
full
it
is
impossible
for
men
who
have
lived
under
such
a
government
to
allow
themselves
ever
to
be
subjugated
they
would
be
very
great
cowards
if
they
did
not
perish
to
the
last
in
order
to
defend
it
with
his
tendency
to
see
things
en
grand
could
not
fail
to
act
accordingly
and
the
moment
he
heard
that
the
federal
city
would
be
neither
new
york
nor
philadelphia
nor
any
other
already
in
existence
but
one
to
be
built
expressly
he
wrote
to
washington
a
letter
remarkable
by
his
clear
understanding
of
the
opportunity
offered
to
the
country
and
by
his
determined
purpose
to
work
not
for
the
three
million
inhabitants
of
his
day
but
for
the
one
hundred
of
ours
and
for
all
the
unborn
millions
that
will
come
after
us
the
letter
is
dated
from
new
york
of
september
sir
he
said
the
late
determination
of
congress
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
city
which
is
to
become
the
capital
of
this
vast
empire
offers
so
great
an
occasion
of
acquiring
reputation
to
whoever
may
be
appointed
to
conduct
the
execution
of
the
business
that
your
excellency
will
not
be
surprised
that
my
ambition
and
the
desire
i
have
of
becoming
a
useful
citizen
should
lead
me
to
wish
a
share
in
the
undertaking
no
nation
perhaps
had
ever
before
the
opportunity
offered
them
of
deliberately
deciding
on
the
spot
where
their
capital
city
should
be
fixed
and
although
the
means
now
within
the
power
of
the
country
are
not
such
as
to
pursue
the
design
to
any
great
extent
it
will
be
obvious
that
the
plan
should
be
drawn
on
such
a
scale
as
to
leave
room
for
that
aggrandizement
and
embellishment
which
the
increase
of
the
wealth
of
the
nation
will
permit
it
to
pursue
at
any
period
however
remote
viewing
the
matter
in
this
light
i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
extent
of
the
undertaking
washington
knew
that
was
afflicted
to
be
sure
with
an
untoward
temper
being
haughty
proud
intractable
but
that
he
was
honest
withal
sincere
loyal
full
of
ideas
and
remarkably
gifted
he
decided
to
intrust
him
with
the
great
task
thus
justifying
a
little
later
his
selection
since
my
first
knowledge
of
the
abilities
in
the
line
of
his
profession
i
have
received
him
not
only
as
a
scientific
man
but
one
who
has
added
considerable
taste
to
professional
knowledge
and
that
for
such
employment
as
he
is
now
engaged
in
for
prosecuting
public
works
and
carrying
them
into
effect
he
was
better
qualified
than
any
one
who
had
come
within
my
knowledge
in
this
country
the
president
informed
that
he
was
to
set
to
work
at
once
and
so
bestir
himself
as
to
have
at
least
a
general
plan
to
show
a
few
months
later
when
he
himself
would
return
from
a
trip
south
on
march
washington
announced
to
colonel
dickens
of
georgetown
the
coming
of
the
major
an
eminent
french
military
engineer
starts
for
georgetown
to
examine
and
survey
the
site
of
the
federal
city
a
few
days
later
the
arrival
of
major
longfont
was
duly
recorded
by
the
weekly
enthusiasm
and
his
desire
to
do
well
and
quickly
had
been
raised
to
a
high
pitch
he
reached
the
place
a
few
days
later
and
found
it
wrapped
in
mist
soaked
in
rain
but
he
would
not
wait
i
see
no
other
way
he
wrote
to
jefferson
on
the
if
by
monday
next
the
weather
does
not
change
but
of
making
a
rough
draft
as
accurate
as
may
be
obtained
by
viewing
the
ground
in
riding
over
it
on
horseback
as
i
have
already
done
yesterday
through
the
rain
to
obtain
a
knowledge
of
the
whole
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
through
a
thick
fog
i
passed
on
many
spots
which
appeared
to
me
really
beautiful
and
which
seem
to
dispute
with
each
other
which
commands
when
he
could
see
the
place
to
better
advantage
his
admiration
knew
no
bounds
in
an
unpublished
letter
to
hamilton
he
says
now
when
you
may
probably
have
heard
that
i
am
finally
charged
with
delineating
a
plan
for
the
city
i
feel
a
sort
of
embarrassment
how
to
speak
to
you
as
advantageously
as
i
really
think
of
the
situation
determined
upon
for
as
there
is
no
doubt
i
must
feel
highly
interested
in
the
success
of
the
undertaking
i
become
apprehensive
of
being
charged
with
partiality
when
i
assure
you
that
no
position
in
america
can
be
more
susceptible
of
grand
improvement
than
that
between
the
eastern
branch
of
the
potomac
and
georgetown
a
few
weeks
later
was
doing
the
honors
of
the
spot
to
a
brother
artist
the
painter
trumbull
just
back
from
yorktown
where
he
had
been
sketching
in
view
of
his
big
picture
of
the
surrendering
of
cornwallis
and
who
wrote
in
his
autobiography
then
to
georgetown
where
i
found
major
drawing
his
plan
of
the
city
of
washington
rode
with
him
over
the
ground
on
which
the
city
has
since
been
built
where
the
capitol
now
stands
was
then
a
thick
wood
may
another
visitor
of
note
came
in
the
same
year
namely
the
french
minister
a
former
companion
in
arms
of
lafayette
and
of
himself
ternant
back
from
a
three
days
stay
at
mount
vernon
and
who
gave
his
government
an
account
of
what
he
had
observed
i
would
not
leave
georgetown
without
having
seen
the
ground
destined
for
the
federal
city
the
position
seemed
to
me
a
most
interesting
one
from
every
point
of
view
the
french
engineer
who
has
already
traced
the
streets
is
busy
preparing
a
detailed
plan
the
president
shows
the
greatest
interest
in
this
new
salente
which
is
to
bear
his
name
the
city
thought
must
be
great
beautiful
and
soon
peopled
drawn
on
that
grand
scale
on
which
it
ought
to
be
planned
meant
to
absorb
georgetown
itself
whose
name
will
before
long
be
suppressed
and
its
whole
district
become
a
part
of
the
cession
it
must
be
quickly
filled
with
inhabitants
because
this
will
strengthen
the
union
i
earnestly
wish
all
that
the
eastern
states
can
spare
may
come
this
way
and
believe
it
would
answer
as
good
a
purpose
as
that
of
their
emigration
to
the
west
it
would
deface
that
line
of
markation
which
will
ever
oppose
the
south
against
the
east
for
when
objects
are
seen
at
a
distance
the
idea
we
form
of
them
is
apt
to
mislead
us
and
we
fancy
monstrous
that
object
which
from
a
nearer
view
would
charm
us
hence
arises
a
natural
though
unwarrantable
prejudice
of
nations
against
nations
of
states
against
states
and
so
down
to
individuals
who
often
mistrust
one
another
for
want
of
being
sufficiently
acquainted
with
each
other
the
city
must
be
beautiful
due
advantage
being
taken
of
the
hilly
nature
of
the
spot
for
grand
or
lovely
prospects
and
of
its
water
resources
for
handsome
fountains
and
cascades
five
grand
fountains
intended
with
a
constant
spout
of
water
a
grand
cascade
at
the
foot
of
capitol
hill
a
part
of
the
plan
which
was
unluckily
left
in
abeyance
some
had
spoken
of
a
plain
rectangular
plan
a
regular
assemblage
of
houses
laid
out
in
squares
and
forming
streets
all
parallel
and
uniform
this
might
be
good
enough
declared
on
a
plain
where
no
surrounding
object
being
interesting
it
becomes
indifferent
which
way
the
opening
street
may
be
directed
but
the
case
is
quite
different
with
the
future
federal
city
such
regular
plans
however
answerable
they
may
appear
on
paper
become
at
last
tiresome
and
insipid
and
it
could
never
be
in
its
origin
but
a
mean
continence
of
some
cool
imagination
wanting
a
sense
of
the
really
grand
and
truly
beautiful
only
to
be
met
with
where
nature
contributes
with
art
and
diversifies
the
objects
we
may
imagine
what
his
feelings
would
be
if
he
saw
in
our
days
the
busy
around
the
city
dumping
as
many
hills
as
possible
into
as
many
vales
and
securing
a
maximum
platitude
but
the
city
must
be
more
than
that
besides
being
beautiful
healthy
commodious
it
should
be
full
of
sentiment
of
associations
of
ideas
everything
in
it
must
be
evocative
and
have
a
meaning
and
a
raison
rarely
was
a
brain
more
busy
than
that
of
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
surveying
the
ground
mapping
out
the
district
sketching
the
chief
buildings
of
the
model
city
that
was
to
be
he
presented
three
reports
to
washington
the
first
giving
only
his
general
ideas
before
the
end
of
march
the
second
in
june
the
last
in
august
the
two
latter
accompanied
with
plans
the
last
of
which
being
the
one
which
was
followed
in
the
building
of
the
city
by
the
amplitude
of
its
scope
the
logic
of
the
arrangements
the
breadth
of
the
streets
and
avenues
the
beauty
of
the
prospects
cleverly
taken
into
account
the
quantity
of
ground
set
apart
for
gardens
and
parks
the
display
of
waters
the
plan
was
a
unique
monument
the
selection
of
the
place
for
what
we
call
the
capitol
and
the
white
house
which
were
then
called
the
federal
house
and
the
palace
for
the
president
near
which
the
ministerial
departments
were
to
be
built
had
been
the
result
of
a
good
deal
of
thinking
and
comparing
after
much
menutial
search
for
an
eligible
situation
prompted
as
i
may
say
from
a
fear
of
being
prejudiced
in
favor
of
a
first
opinion
i
could
discover
no
one
so
advantageously
to
greet
the
congressional
building
as
is
that
on
the
west
end
of
jenkins
heights
which
stand
as
a
pedestal
waiting
for
a
monument
some
might
perhaps
require
less
labor
to
be
made
agreeable
but
after
all
assistance
of
arts
none
ever
would
be
made
so
grand
on
that
very
pedestal
now
rises
the
capitol
of
the
united
states
as
for
the
presidential
palace
made
his
choice
with
the
object
he
says
of
adding
to
the
sumptuousness
of
a
palace
the
convenience
of
a
house
and
the
agreeableness
of
a
country
seat
which
are
the
three
main
qualities
actually
combined
in
the
present
white
house
he
selected
a
spot
which
washington
had
himself
noticed
as
a
convenient
one
at
some
distance
from
congress
it
is
true
but
that
would
not
matter
much
thought
with
his
notions
of
etiquette
for
no
message
to
nor
from
the
president
is
to
be
made
without
a
sort
of
decorum
which
will
doubtless
point
out
the
propriety
of
committee
waiting
on
him
in
carriage
should
his
palace
be
even
contiguous
to
congress
since
it
was
a
question
of
driving
it
little
mattered
whether
the
drive
was
to
be
a
little
more
or
less
long
for
different
reasons
president
washington
approved
of
that
distance
e
longinquo
he
apparently
thought
where
and
how
he
once
wrote
to
alexander
white
the
houses
for
the
president
and
other
public
officers
may
be
fixed
is
to
me
as
an
individual
a
matter
of
moonshine
but
the
daily
intercourse
which
the
secretaries
of
the
departments
must
have
with
the
president
would
render
a
distant
situation
extremely
inconvenient
to
them
and
not
much
less
so
would
one
be
close
to
the
capitol
for
it
was
the
universal
complaint
of
them
all
that
while
the
legislature
was
in
session
they
could
do
little
or
no
business
so
much
were
they
interrupted
by
the
individual
visits
of
members
in
office
hours
and
by
calls
for
papers
many
of
them
have
declared
to
me
that
they
have
often
been
obliged
to
go
home
and
deny
themselves
in
order
to
transact
the
current
business
in
that
respect
carriage
or
no
carriage
distance
would
have
its
merits
letters
and
the
notes
accompanying
his
plans
show
that
everything
in
the
future
city
had
been
devised
indeed
with
an
intention
fountains
and
a
cascade
for
health
and
beauty
an
avenue
of
noble
buildings
leading
from
the
capitol
to
the
presidential
house
and
increasing
the
dignified
appearance
of
both
the
grand
avenue
he
wrote
connecting
both
the
palace
and
the
federal
house
will
be
most
magnificent
and
most
convenient
with
a
number
of
handsome
monuments
a
very
characteristic
one
being
a
temple
for
national
semireligious
celebrations
such
as
public
prayer
thanksgivings
funeral
orations
and
assigned
to
the
special
use
of
no
particular
sect
or
denomination
but
equally
opened
to
all
it
would
also
be
a
pantheon
for
the
illustrious
dead
as
may
hereafter
be
decreed
by
the
voice
of
a
grateful
nation
a
column
as
yet
never
built
was
to
be
erected
to
celebrate
the
first
rise
of
a
navy
and
to
stand
a
ready
monument
to
consecrate
its
progress
and
achievements
the
squares
were
to
be
allotted
one
to
each
of
the
states
forming
the
union
the
centre
of
each
square
will
admit
of
statues
columns
obelisks
or
any
other
ornaments
to
perpetuate
not
only
the
memory
of
such
individuals
whose
counsels
or
military
achievements
were
conspicuous
in
giving
liberty
and
independence
to
this
country
but
also
those
whose
usefulness
hath
rendered
them
worthy
of
general
imitation
to
invite
the
youth
of
succeeding
generations
to
tread
in
the
paths
of
those
sages
or
heroes
whom
their
country
has
thought
proper
to
celebrate
this
was
a
way
considered
of
fortifying
the
union
and
of
giving
to
the
very
city
that
educational
value
to
which
he
attached
so
much
importance
chief
among
those
patriotic
objects
was
to
be
at
some
distance
north
of
the
place
where
the
washington
monument
now
rises
the
equestrian
figure
of
george
washington
a
monument
voted
in
by
the
late
continental
congress
and
must
certainly
have
hoped
that
the
author
would
be
his
illustrious
compatriot
the
sculptor
houdon
on
whose
behalf
we
have
seen
him
writing
to
congress
in
as
to
the
probable
cost
distant
views
and
prospects
were
of
course
to
be
used
to
the
best
advantage
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
passing
of
those
leading
avenues
over
the
most
favorable
ground
for
prospect
and
convenience
but
above
all
was
persistent
in
his
request
that
on
no
account
the
grandeur
of
his
conception
be
in
any
way
curtailed
it
was
to
remain
commensurate
with
the
greatness
of
the
united
states
of
future
times
the
plan
must
leave
to
posterity
a
grand
idea
of
the
patriotic
interest
which
promoted
it
he
foresaw
much
opposition
to
some
of
his
ideas
but
besought
the
president
to
stand
by
him
and
especially
to
prevent
any
dwarfing
of
his
views
i
remain
assured
you
will
conceive
it
essential
to
pursue
with
dignity
the
operation
of
an
undertaking
of
a
magnitude
so
worthy
of
the
concern
of
a
grand
empire
over
whose
progress
the
eyes
of
every
other
nation
envying
the
opportunity
denied
them
will
stand
judge
to
make
a
man
of
that
temper
and
enthusiasm
having
a
reason
for
each
of
his
propositions
accept
hints
and
change
his
mind
was
almost
an
impossibility
in
vain
did
jefferson
object
to
the
obligation
to
build
the
houses
at
a
given
distance
from
the
street
it
produces
a
disgusting
monotony
all
persons
make
this
complaint
against
philadelphia
in
the
same
record
of
his
views
however
and
much
more
to
his
credit
washington
secretary
of
state
is
seen
foreseeing
the
and
its
dangers
in
paris
it
is
forbidden
to
build
a
house
beyond
a
given
height
and
it
is
admitted
to
be
a
good
restriction
it
keeps
down
the
price
of
grounds
keeps
the
houses
low
and
convenient
and
the
streets
light
and
airy
fires
are
much
more
manageable
when
houses
are
low
as
was
only
too
well
evidenced
since
in
the
fires
at
chicago
baltimore
and
san
francisco
as
for
the
president
himself
he
had
practical
ideas
on
some
points
such
as
the
befitting
distance
between
the
places
of
abode
of
congress
and
of
the
chief
of
the
state
and
what
was
of
more
import
the
necessarily
large
extent
of
the
ground
to
be
reserved
for
the
building
of
the
future
capital
on
the
rest
with
his
habit
of
trusting
those
who
knew
he
seems
to
have
left
free
rein
to
submitting
to
him
certain
suggestions
some
from
jefferson
he
allows
him
to
use
them
or
not
as
he
pleases
and
he
personally
seems
to
incline
toward
not
sir
although
i
do
not
conceive
that
you
will
derive
any
material
advantage
from
an
examination
of
the
inclosed
papers
yet
as
they
have
been
drawn
under
different
circumstances
and
by
different
persons
they
may
be
compared
with
your
own
ideas
of
a
proper
plan
for
the
federal
city
the
rough
sketch
by
jefferson
was
done
under
an
idea
that
no
offer
worthy
of
consideration
would
come
from
the
landholders
in
the
vicinity
of
carrollsburgh
from
the
backwardness
which
appeared
in
them
and
therefore
was
accommodated
to
the
grounds
about
georgetown
criticism
of
plan
turned
out
to
be
insignificant
and
the
approbation
general
the
work
of
major
which
is
greatly
admired
will
show
washington
said
that
he
had
many
objects
to
attend
to
and
to
combine
not
on
paper
merely
but
to
make
them
correspond
with
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
ground
jefferson
who
had
the
good
taste
not
to
stick
to
his
own
former
suggestions
was
sending
a
little
later
copies
of
the
plan
to
gouverneur
morris
then
minister
to
france
for
him
to
exhibit
in
various
cities
as
a
thing
for
the
united
states
to
be
proud
of
i
sent
you
by
the
way
of
london
a
dozen
plans
of
the
city
of
washington
in
the
federal
territory
hoping
you
would
have
them
displayed
to
public
view
where
they
would
be
most
seen
by
those
descriptions
of
men
worthy
and
likely
to
be
attracted
to
it
paris
lyons
rouen
and
the
seaport
towns
of
havre
nantes
bordeaux
and
marseille
would
be
proper
places
to
send
them
to
three
assistants
had
been
given
to
two
of
the
ellicot
brothers
andrew
and
benjamin
and
isaac
roberdeau
the
major
trustiest
second
three
commissioners
of
the
district
had
been
appointed
thomas
johnson
and
daniel
carroll
both
of
maryland
and
david
stuart
of
virginia
they
notified
on
the
of
september
that
a
name
had
been
selected
for
the
district
and
the
city
we
have
agreed
that
the
federal
district
shall
be
called
territory
of
columbia
and
the
federal
city
city
of
washington
the
title
of
the
map
will
therefore
be
map
of
the
city
of
washington
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
expropriation
of
the
ground
with
a
minimum
actual
outlay
an
ingenious
system
also
applied
elsewhere
had
been
adopted
the
terms
entered
into
by
me
washington
wrote
to
jefferson
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
with
the
landowners
of
georgetown
and
carrollsburgh
are
that
all
the
land
from
rock
creek
along
the
river
to
the
eastern
branch
is
ceded
to
the
public
on
condition
that
when
the
whole
shall
be
surveyed
and
laid
off
as
a
city
which
major
is
now
directed
to
do
the
present
proprietors
shall
retain
every
other
lot
and
for
such
parts
of
the
land
as
may
be
taken
for
public
use
they
shall
be
allowed
at
the
rate
of
pounds
per
acre
the
public
having
the
right
to
reserve
such
parts
of
the
wood
on
the
land
as
may
be
thought
necessary
to
be
preserved
for
ornament
the
landholders
to
have
the
use
and
profit
of
all
the
grounds
until
the
city
is
laid
off
into
lots
which
by
this
agreement
became
public
property
nothing
is
to
be
allowed
for
the
ground
which
may
be
occupied
as
streets
or
alleys
the
president
was
confident
that
everybody
would
acquiesce
and
show
even
the
obstinate
mr
burns
but
it
turned
out
that
there
were
other
obstinate
people
besides
burns
himself
chief
among
them
he
had
evinced
from
the
first
a
great
fear
of
speculators
and
was
at
once
at
war
with
them
how
far
he
boldly
wrote
to
hamilton
i
have
contributed
to
overset
that
plotting
business
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
tell
besides
i
am
not
wholly
satisfied
whether
i
would
be
thanked
for
by
the
people
among
whom
you
live
the
three
commissioners
had
notions
of
their
own
but
could
never
bring
to
take
into
account
either
their
persons
or
their
ideas
he
would
acknowledge
no
chief
except
washington
who
gently
at
first
firmly
afterward
sternly
later
and
vainly
throughout
tried
to
make
the
major
understand
that
he
was
one
of
the
subordinates
a
great
reciprocal
irritation
which
even
the
painstaking
diplomacy
could
not
assuage
began
between
them
from
the
first
out
of
fear
of
speculators
wanted
the
sale
of
the
lots
to
be
delayed
while
the
commissioners
desired
to
make
a
beginning
as
soon
as
possible
the
officer
kept
accordingly
his
plan
to
himself
and
refused
to
have
it
shown
to
purchasers
how
then
washington
exclaimed
could
they
be
induced
to
buy
to
borrow
an
old
adage
a
in
a
the
major
would
not
be
persuaded
and
giving
an
early
example
of
an
unconquerable
fear
of
what
would
now
be
called
a
trust
he
persisted
in
refusing
to
show
his
plan
to
any
individual
or
association
he
had
declared
beforehand
in
one
of
his
reports
to
the
president
what
were
his
views
and
how
things
should
be
delayed
until
the
plan
could
be
engraved
distributed
all
over
the
country
and
made
known
to
all
people
at
the
same
time
a
sale
made
previous
the
general
plan
of
the
distribution
of
the
city
is
made
public
and
before
the
circumstance
of
that
sale
taking
place
has
had
time
to
be
known
through
the
whole
continent
will
not
call
a
sufficient
concurrence
and
must
be
confined
to
a
few
individuals
speculating
and
the
consequence
of
a
low
sale
in
this
first
instance
may
prove
injurious
to
the
subsequent
ones
by
serving
as
precedents
he
was
afraid
of
the
plotting
of
a
number
of
certain
designing
men
of
the
forming
of
a
society
organized
to
engross
the
most
of
the
sale
and
master
the
whole
business
when
one
of
the
chief
landowners
of
the
district
daniel
carroll
of
duddington
a
relative
of
one
of
the
commissioners
decided
in
spite
of
all
warnings
to
go
on
with
the
building
of
a
house
across
what
was
to
be
new
jersey
avenue
matters
came
to
a
crisis
washington
tried
to
pacify
whose
indignation
knew
no
bounds
as
a
similar
case
he
wrote
to
him
can
not
happen
again
carroll
house
having
been
begun
before
the
federal
district
was
fixed
upon
no
precedent
will
be
established
by
yielding
a
little
in
the
present
instance
and
it
will
always
be
found
sound
policy
to
conciliate
the
rather
than
provoke
the
enmity
of
any
man
where
it
can
be
accomplished
without
much
difficulty
inconvenience
or
loss
but
even
at
the
request
of
a
leader
whom
he
worshipped
would
not
be
persuaded
with
no
authority
from
the
commissioners
he
sent
his
faithful
roberdeau
to
raze
the
house
to
the
ground
which
was
but
partly
done
when
the
commissioners
had
roberdeau
arrested
thereupon
came
in
person
with
some
laborers
and
saw
the
work
of
destruction
perfected
november
he
barely
escaped
arrest
himself
washington
who
as
he
wrote
to
jefferson
was
loath
to
lose
his
services
which
in
my
opinion
would
be
a
serious
misfortune
severely
remonstrated
now
with
the
major
in
future
i
must
strictly
enjoin
you
to
touch
no
property
without
his
consent
or
the
previous
order
of
the
commissioners
adding
in
kindlier
tones
having
the
beauty
and
regularity
of
your
plan
only
in
view
you
pursue
it
as
if
every
person
or
thing
were
obliged
to
yield
to
it
but
so
they
are
thought
for
him
the
city
was
his
city
his
child
and
a
father
has
a
right
to
rear
his
child
as
he
pleases
remonstrating
went
on
some
time
jefferson
came
to
the
rescue
of
the
president
used
the
fairest
means
asked
the
major
to
dine
with
him
tête
à
tête
so
as
to
quietly
discuss
the
federal
city
the
hour
for
the
meal
differing
rather
widely
from
ours
jefferson
presents
his
compliments
to
major
and
is
sorry
to
have
been
absent
when
he
was
so
kind
as
to
call
on
him
as
he
wishes
to
have
some
conversation
with
him
on
the
subject
of
the
federal
city
he
asks
the
favor
of
him
to
come
and
take
a
private
dinner
with
him
at
half
after
three
which
may
afford
time
and
opportunity
for
the
saturday
january
nothing
resulted
another
landowner
notley
young
had
been
found
in
december
building
a
house
which
had
contrary
to
expectation
fallen
into
a
principal
street
but
i
hope
washington
wrote
the
commissioners
the
major
does
not
mean
to
proceed
to
the
demolition
of
this
also
on
no
point
would
yield
so
that
on
march
jefferson
wrote
to
the
commissioners
it
having
been
found
impracticable
to
employ
major
in
that
degree
of
subordination
which
was
lawful
and
proper
he
has
been
notified
that
his
services
were
at
an
end
a
consolation
and
a
comfort
to
him
was
the
immediate
signing
by
all
the
landowners
of
the
district
except
two
of
a
testimonial
lamenting
his
departure
wishing
for
his
return
praising
his
work
for
we
well
know
that
your
time
and
the
whole
powers
of
your
mind
have
been
for
months
entirely
devoted
to
the
arrangements
in
the
city
which
reflect
so
much
honor
on
your
taste
and
judgment
iv
the
bright
part
of
life
was
over
his
fame
was
great
and
appeals
continued
for
some
time
to
be
made
to
him
when
important
works
were
contemplated
but
his
same
tendency
to
ever
see
things
en
grand
his
unyielding
disposition
his
increasing
and
almost
morbid
fear
of
speculators
wrecked
more
than
one
of
his
undertakings
almost
on
his
leaving
his
work
at
washington
he
was
asked
to
draw
the
plans
of
the
first
manufacturing
city
devised
as
such
in
the
united
states
and
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
in
existence
paterson
major
it
is
said
wrote
washington
who
still
retained
a
friendly
feeling
for
him
is
performing
wonders
at
the
new
town
of
paterson
the
moving
spirit
was
hamilton
under
whose
influence
had
been
founded
the
society
for
the
establishing
useful
manufactures
the
chief
point
was
to
transform
into
a
city
a
spot
where
only
ten
houses
were
in
existence
and
to
make
of
it
an
industrial
one
by
turning
into
use
the
falls
of
the
passaic
several
letters
of
the
major
to
hamilton
giving
an
account
of
the
work
in
which
faithful
roberdeau
was
helping
and
of
the
increasing
difficulties
with
all
sorts
of
people
are
preserved
in
the
library
of
congress
after
one
toil
was
once
more
notified
that
his
services
were
no
longer
wanted
he
is
found
in
the
same
year
and
the
following
one
working
as
an
engineer
at
fort
mifflin
on
the
delaware
and
as
an
architect
at
a
mansion
in
philadelphia
which
was
to
surpass
in
magnificence
any
other
in
the
states
it
had
been
ordered
of
him
by
robert
morris
the
financier
of
the
revolution
and
the
richest
man
in
america
here
was
if
ever
an
occasion
to
do
things
en
grand
however
did
them
en
plus
grand
than
even
the
financier
had
dreamed
improvements
and
afterthoughts
the
use
of
marble
for
columns
and
façades
increased
the
delay
and
the
expense
his
being
busy
at
paterson
had
also
been
at
first
another
cause
of
complaint
dear
sir
morris
beseechingly
wrote
him
from
philadelphia
i
had
like
to
have
stopped
my
house
for
fear
of
wanting
money
that
difficulty
being
removed
it
will
now
be
stopped
for
want
of
major
the
roof
had
at
last
been
put
on
and
one
could
judge
of
the
beauty
of
the
ensemble
quite
remarkable
as
we
can
see
from
a
sketch
by
birch
the
elder
preserved
in
the
philadelphia
library
when
morris
catastrophe
occurred
putting
an
end
to
the
work
and
swallowing
part
if
not
all
of
savings
in
his
delight
at
being
intrusted
with
the
plan
of
the
federal
city
he
had
never
said
a
word
about
any
remuneration
and
he
had
not
copyrighted
his
plan
at
the
time
of
his
dismissal
washington
had
written
to
the
commissioners
the
plan
of
the
city
having
met
universal
applause
as
far
as
my
information
goes
and
major
having
become
a
very
discontented
man
it
was
thought
that
less
than
from
two
thousand
five
hundred
to
three
thousand
dollars
would
not
be
proper
to
offer
him
for
his
services
instead
of
this
suppose
five
hundred
guineas
and
a
lot
in
a
good
part
of
the
city
were
substituted
the
offer
was
made
refused
without
giving
reasons
more
and
more
gloomy
times
were
in
store
for
him
mishaps
and
disappointments
multiplied
he
had
laid
great
store
on
the
selling
of
copies
of
his
plan
but
since
he
had
not
copyrighted
it
no
royalty
on
the
sale
was
reserved
for
him
he
protested
against
this
against
the
way
in
which
the
engraving
had
been
made
with
grievous
errors
of
execution
and
against
the
suppression
of
his
name
on
it
depriving
me
of
the
repute
of
the
projector
contrary
however
to
the
fear
expressed
at
first
by
washington
that
out
of
spite
he
might
in
his
discontent
side
with
the
many
who
disapproved
of
the
vast
and
difficult
undertaking
he
remained
loyal
to
it
and
there
is
no
record
of
any
act
or
word
that
tarnishes
his
life
history
with
the
blemish
of
disloyalty
to
the
creation
of
his
genius
he
bore
his
honors
and
disappointments
in
humility
and
poverty
poverty
was
indeed
at
his
door
and
soon
in
his
house
haunted
by
the
notion
of
his
wrongs
some
only
too
real
some
more
or
less
imaginary
he
sent
to
congress
memoir
after
memoir
recalling
what
he
had
done
and
what
was
his
destitution
the
absolute
destruction
of
his
fortune
in
europe
owing
to
the
french
revolution
his
being
reduced
from
a
state
of
ease
and
content
to
one
the
most
distressed
and
helpless
living
as
he
did
upon
borrowed
bread
but
he
would
not
doubt
of
the
magnanimity
and
justice
of
congress
the
family
fortune
had
been
reduced
indeed
to
a
low
ebb
his
own
lack
of
attention
to
his
financial
affairs
making
matters
worse
his
inability
to
properly
attend
to
them
is
only
too
well
evidenced
by
some
letters
from
french
relatives
showing
that
while
he
was
himself
in
absolute
want
he
neglected
to
receive
the
pension
bestowed
on
him
by
the
french
government
and
which
in
spite
of
the
revolution
had
been
maintained
he
had
also
inherited
from
the
old
painter
his
father
a
small
farm
in
normandy
but
had
taken
no
steps
about
it
so
that
the
farmer
never
ceased
to
pocket
the
revenues
one
of
these
letters
which
tells
him
of
the
death
of
his
mother
who
died
with
the
piety
of
an
angel
shows
what
reports
reached
france
as
to
the
major
standing
among
his
american
friends
all
the
persons
whom
i
have
seen
and
who
know
you
assured
me
that
you
enjoyed
public
esteem
this
is
everything
in
a
country
of
which
people
praise
the
morals
the
virtues
and
the
probity
as
worthy
of
our
first
ancestors
on
two
occasions
after
many
years
congress
voted
modest
sums
for
but
they
were
at
once
appropriated
by
his
creditors
he
was
moreover
appointed
in
professor
of
the
art
of
military
engineering
in
the
military
academy
of
the
united
states
a
nomination
which
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
james
monroe
then
secretary
of
state
he
declined
he
is
found
in
september
working
at
fort
washington
when
fifty
men
with
spades
and
axes
are
sent
him
he
survived
eleven
years
haunting
the
lobbies
of
the
capitol
pacing
the
newly
marked
avenues
of
his
city
watching
its
growth
deploring
the
slightest
deviation
from
his
original
design
for
as
washington
had
early
noticed
he
was
so
tenacious
of
his
plans
as
to
conceive
that
they
would
be
marred
if
they
underwent
any
change
or
alteration
visiting
the
friends
he
had
among
the
early
settlers
corcoran
who
lately
departed
this
life
in
the
city
of
washington
full
of
years
and
honor
had
a
very
distinct
recollection
of
the
personal
appearance
of
the
latter
having
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
his
father
house
he
described
him
to
me
as
a
tall
erect
man
fully
six
feet
in
height
finely
proportioned
nose
prominent
of
military
bearing
courtly
air
and
polite
manners
his
figure
usually
enveloped
in
a
long
overcoat
and
surmounted
by
a
hat
a
man
who
would
attract
attention
in
any
assembly
he
ended
his
days
the
permanent
guest
of
the
digges
family
in
their
house
near
washington
his
death
occurred
there
in
and
he
was
buried
in
their
property
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
an
inventory
of
his
personal
goods
and
chattels
showed
that
they
consisted
in
three
watches
three
compasses
some
books
maps
and
surveying
instruments
the
whole
being
valued
at
dollars
the
federal
city
washington
had
written
in
to
sarah
fairfax
then
in
england
will
be
a
great
and
beautiful
one
a
century
hence
if
this
country
keeps
united
and
it
is
surely
its
policy
and
interest
to
do
it
it
took
indeed
a
great
many
years
and
for
a
long
time
doubters
could
enjoy
their
doubts
and
jokers
their
jokes
the
duke
de
la
visited
the
incipient
town
in
he
found
that
it
possessed
one
hundred
and
fifty
houses
scattered
here
and
there
the
house
for
the
president
was
ready
to
be
covered
the
same
year
and
the
only
wing
of
the
capitol
yet
begun
was
to
receive
its
roof
the
year
following
both
being
handsome
buildings
in
white
stones
very
well
wrought
but
the
unredeemable
fault
in
his
eyes
was
the
very
magnitude
and
beauty
of
the
plan
the
plan
he
wrote
is
fine
cleverly
and
grandly
designed
but
it
is
its
very
grandeur
its
magnificence
which
causes
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
dream
the
distance
so
heartily
approved
of
by
washington
between
the
president
house
and
the
capitol
seemed
to
the
traveller
a
serious
objection
the
raising
of
five
hundred
houses
would
be
necessary
to
connect
the
two
buildings
not
one
is
in
existence
if
this
gap
is
not
filled
communication
will
be
impracticable
in
winter
for
one
can
scarcely
suppose
that
the
united
states
would
undergo
the
expense
for
pavement
footpaths
and
lamps
for
such
a
long
stretch
of
uninhabited
ground
this
wonder
has
however
been
seen
for
a
long
time
for
more
than
half
the
present
duration
of
the
life
deriders
could
deride
to
their
heart
content
few
cities
have
ever
been
so
abundantly
nicknamed
as
washington
the
wilderness
city
the
city
of
magnificent
distances
the
village
monumental
the
city
as
reported
by
ampère
the
son
of
the
great
scientist
who
visited
it
in
of
streets
without
houses
and
of
houses
without
streets
he
saw
in
its
fate
a
striking
proof
of
this
truth
that
one
can
not
create
a
great
city
at
will
but
this
truth
as
some
others
has
proved
an
untruth
the
growth
was
slow
indeed
but
constant
and
when
the
century
was
over
washington
prophecy
and
foresight
were
justified
by
the
event
a
city
had
risen
ample
and
beautiful
a
proper
capital
for
a
wealthy
and
powerful
nation
one
quite
apart
copied
on
no
other
not
one
of
those
cities
as
was
remarked
in
our
days
by
one
of
washington
successors
roosevelt
of
which
you
can
cut
out
a
piece
and
transplant
it
into
another
without
any
one
perceiving
that
something
has
happened
then
at
last
came
day
what
he
had
always
expected
for
his
city
took
place
what
he
had
never
expected
for
himself
took
place
also
in
january
both
the
park
commission
composed
of
daniel
burnham
charles
mckim
augustus
and
olmsted
and
the
senate
committee
presented
their
reports
on
the
improvement
and
development
of
washington
the
conclusions
were
the
original
plan
of
the
city
of
washington
having
stood
the
test
of
a
century
has
met
universal
approval
the
departures
from
that
plan
are
to
be
regretted
and
wherever
possible
remedied
it
was
thus
resolved
to
revert
as
much
as
circumstances
allowed
and
in
spite
of
a
heavy
outlay
to
several
of
ideas
especially
to
one
which
he
considered
of
greatest
importance
and
which
had
been
kept
so
long
in
abeyance
the
giving
of
its
proper
character
to
that
grand
avenue
between
the
capitol
and
the
white
house
meant
to
be
most
magnificent
and
most
convenient
it
is
now
going
to
be
both
as
for
himself
one
more
appropriation
this
time
not
to
go
to
his
creditors
was
voted
by
congress
on
account
of
the
major
and
it
was
resolved
that
his
ashes
the
place
of
which
continued
to
be
marked
only
by
a
tree
should
be
removed
to
arlington
national
cemetery
to
lie
in
that
army
of
the
dead
former
members
of
the
regiments
of
that
republic
for
which
he
had
fought
and
bled
his
remains
were
brought
to
what
had
been
jenkins
hill
and
placed
under
the
great
dome
of
the
capitol
in
the
presence
of
the

acquaintance

nature
as
a
pupil
of

french
huguenot
maryes
who
kept
a
school
at
fredericksburg
and
did
teach
him
french
we
find
him
carefully
transcribing
in

elegant
youthful
hand
those
famous
rules
of
civility
and
decent
behavior
in
company
and
conversation
which
have
recently
been
proved
to
be
french
whether
this
french
teaching
given
him
by
a
frenchman
engraved
itself
in
his
mind
or
happened
to
match
his
natural
disposition
or
both
certain
it
is
that
he
lived
up
to
the
best
among
those
maxims
those
for
example
and
they
are
remarkably
numerous
that
deprecate
jokes
and
railing
at
the

of
others

those
of

import
advising
the
young
man
to
be
no
flatterer
to
show
no
sign
of
choler
in
reproving
but
to
do
it
with
sweetness
and
mildness
those
prescribing
that
his
recreations
be
manful
not
sinful
and
giving
him
this
advice
of
supreme
importance
which
washington
observed
throughout
life
labor
to
keep
alive
in
your
breast
that
little
spark
of
celestial
fire
called
conscience
another
chance
that
washington
had
to
become
acquainted
with
things
french
was
through
his
reading
and
was
less
favorable
to
them
an
early
note
in
his
hand
informs
us
that
about
the
year
he
being
then
sixteen
had
in
the
read

no
all
those

had
been
written

when
we
were
fighting

malbrouk
not
a
portrait
of
the
french
in
those
numbers
that
is
not
a
caricature
they
are
a
ludicrous
nation
their
women
are
fantastical
their
men
vain
and
lively
their
fashions
ridiculous
not
even
their
wines
find
grace
in
the
eyes
of
steele
who
could
plead
it
is
true
that
he
was
not
without
experience
on
the
subject
and
who
declares
that
this
plaguy
french
claret
is
greatly
inferior
to
a
bottle

two

washington
was
soon
to
learn
more
of
french
people
and
was
to
find
that
they
were
something
else
than
mere
ludicrous
and
lively
puppets
a
soldier
born
with
all
that
is
necessary

back
to
the
governor
i
am
here
by
the
orders
of
my
general
and
i
entreat
you
sir
not
to
doubt
but
that
i
shall
try
to
conform
myself
to
them
with
all
the
exactness
and
resolution
which
must
be
expected
from
a
good
officer
he
has
much
the
air
of
a
soldier
washington
wrote
of
him
de
added
on
his
part
a
word
on
the
bearer
of
governor
dinwiddie
message
who
was
to
be
the
bearer
also
of
his
answer
and
in
this
we
have
the
first
french
comment
on
washington
personality
i
made
it
my
particular
care
to
receive
washington
with
a
distinction
suitable
to
your
dignity
as
well
as
to
his
own
personal
from
the
fort
on
the
december
having
received
plentiful
supplies
as
a
gift
from
the
french
but
entertaining
the
worst
misgivings
as
to
their
artifices
the
young
officer
began
his
return
journey
during
which
in
spite
of
all
trouble
he
managed
to
pay
a
visit
to
queen
aliquippa
i
made
her
a
present
he
wrote
of
a
and
a
bottle
of
rum
which
latter
was
thought
much
the
best
present
of
the
two
on
the
of
january
he
was
back
at
williamsburg
handed
to
the
governor
de
negative
answer
and
printed
an
account
of
his
journey
the
second
expedition
a
military
one
was
marked
next
year
by
the
sad
and
famous
jumonville
incident
and
by
the
surrendering
to
the
brother
of
dead
jumonville
of
fort
necessity
where
the
subjects
of
king
george
and
their
youthful
colonel
after
a
fight
lasting
from
eleven
in
the
morning
till
eight
in
the
evening
had
to
capitulate
being
permitted
however
by
the
french
to
withdraw
with
full
military
honors
and
taking
with
them
one
small
piece
of
ordnance
july
the
fort
and
the
rest
of
the
artillery
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
captors
as
well
as
part
of
that
diary
which
although
with
interruptions
washington
was
fond
of
keeping
whenever
he
could
his
last
entry
being
dated
friday
december
the
day
before
his
death
the
part
found
at
fort
necessity
march
to
june
was
sent
to
paris
translated
into
french
printed
in
by
the
royal
government
and
the
text
given
in
washington
writings
is
only
a
retranslation
from
the
french
the
original
english
not
having
been
preserved
the
third
occasion
was
the
terrible
campaign
of
which
ended
in
braddock
death
and
the
defeat
of
the
english
regulars
on
the
monongahela
not
far
from
the
newly
built
fort
duquesne
later
pittsburgh
july
contrary
to
expectation
there
being
about
three
hundred
french
and
indians
wrote
washington
our
numbers
consisted
of
about
thirteen
hundred
men
chiefly
regulars
the
french
won
the
day
nearly
doing
to
death
their
future
a
rumor
was
even
spread
that
he
had
actually
succumbed
after
composing
a
dying
speech
and
washington
had
to
write
to
his
brother
john
to
assure
him
that
he
had
had
as
yet
no
occasion
for
such
a
composition
though
very
near
having
had
it
by
the
dispensation
of
providence
i
have
been
protected
beyond
all
human
probability
and
expectation
for
i
had
four
bullets
through
my
coat
and
two
horses
shot
under
me
yet
escaped
unhurt
although
death
was
levelling
my
companions
on
every
side
of
me
we
have
been
most
scandalously
beaten
by
an
irony
of
fate
in
this
expedition
against
the
french
in
which
george
washington
acted
as
to
the
english
general
the
means
of
transportation
had
been
supplied
by
postmaster
benjamin
franklin
the
french
were
indubitably
different
from
the
airy
fops
of
but
they
were
as
far
as
ever
from
commanding
young
washington
sympathy
it
was
part
of
his
loyalism
to
hate
them
and
to
interpret
for
the
worst
anything
they
could
do
or
say
the
master
of
an
ampler
vocabulary
than
he
is
sometimes
credited
with
we
find
him
writing
to
richard
washington
in
that
the
means
by
which
the
french
maintain
themselves
in
the
ohio
valley
are
hellish
a
few
years
later
the
tone
is
greatly
altered
not
yet
toward
the
french
but
toward
the
british
government
and
king
in
sad
solemn
words
full
already
of
the
spirit
of
the
washington
of
history
he
warns
his
friend
and
neighbor
george
mason
the
one
who
was
to
draw
the
first
constitution
of
virginia
of
the
great
crisis
now
looming
american
freedom
is
at
stake
it
seems
highly
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
to
avert
the
stroke
and
maintain
the
liberty
which
we
have
derived
from
our
ancestors
but
the
manner
of
doing
it
to
answer
the
purpose
effectually
is
the
point
in
question
that
no
man
should
scruple
or
hesitate
a
moment
to
use
in
defense
of
so
valuable
a
blessing
on
which
all
the
good
and
evil
of
life
depends
is
clearly
my
opinion
yet
i
would
beg
leave
to
add
should
be
the
last
resource
the
absolutely
firm
absolutely
moderate
such
was
washington
to
continue
to
the
end
of
the
impending
struggle
and
indeed
of
his
days
the
life
of
the
great
washington
was
now
beginning
ii
some
more
years
elapse
and
when
the
curtain
rises
again
on
scenes
of
war
momentous
changes
have
occurred
to
the
last
hour
the
former
officer
of
the
colonial
wars
now
a
man
of
was
still
expressing
the
wish
that
the
dispute
had
been
left
to
posterity
to
determine
but
the
crisis
has
arrived
when
we
must
assert
our
rights
or
submit
to
every
imposition
that
can
be
heaped
upon
us
till
custom
and
use
make
us
as
tame
and
abject
slaves
as
the
blacks
we
rule
over
with
such
arbitrary
sway
it
was
hard
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
fact
that
the
english
were
really
to
be
the
enemy
he
long
tried
to
believe
that
the
quarrel
was
not
with
england
and
her
king
but
only
with
the
ministry
and
their
troops
which
he
calls
the
ministerials
writing
on
the
of
may
from
philadelphia
where
he
was
attending
the
second
continental
congress
to
fairfax
in
england
he
gave
him
an
account
of
the
clash
between
the
provincials
of
massachusetts
and
the
ministerial
troops
for
we
do
not
nor
can
we
yet
prevail
upon
ourselves
to
call
them
the
king
troops
the
war
was
to
be
in
his
eyes
a
fratricidal
one
unhappy
it
is
though
to
reflect
that
a
brother
sword
has
been
sheathed
in
a
brother
breast
and
that
the
once
happy
and
peaceful
plains
of
america
are
either
to
be
drenched
with
blood
or
inhabited
by
slaves
sad
alternative
but
can
a
virtuous
man
hesitate
in
his
choice
two
weeks
later
the
signer
of
this
letter
was
appointed
on
the
proposition
of
john
adams
of
massachusetts
of
a
new
body
of
troops
just
entering
history
and
called
the
continental
army
braddock
former
aide
was
to
become
the
leader
of
a
yet
unborn
nation
in
an
conflict
with
britain
mistress
of
the
coasts
mistress
of
the
seas
what
that
conflict
was
and
what
the
results
have
been
all
the
world
knows
there
were
sad
days
and
bright
days
there
were
valley
forge
and
saratoga
no
man
i
believe
washington
wrote
concerning
his
own
fate
had
a
greater
choice
of
difficulties
the
french
had
ceased
by
then
to
inspire
washington
with
disdain
or
animosity
he
was
beginning
to
render
them
better
justice
but
his
heart
was
far
as
yet
from
being
won
french
volunteers
had
early
begun
to
flock
to
the
american
army
some
of
them
as
much
an
encumbrance
as
a
help
they
seem
to
be
genteel
sensible
men
wrote
washington
to
congress
in
october
and
i
have
no
doubt
of
their
making
good
officers
as
soon
as
they
can
learn
so
much
of
our
language
as
to
make
themselves
well
understood
one
of
them
the
learned
was
a
young
enthusiast
who
had
left
wife
and
child
to
serve
the
american
cause
as
a
volunteer
and
without
pay
like
george
washington
himself
he
had
crossed
the
ocean
escaping
the
british
cruisers
on
a
boat
called
he
being
called
lafayette
one
more
encumbrance
audibly
muttered
the
general
who
wrote
to
benjamin
harrison
what
the
designs
of
congress
respecting
this
gentleman
were
and
what
line
of
conduct
i
am
to
pursue
to
comply
with
their
design
and
his
expectation
i
know
no
more
than
the
child
unborn
and
beg
to
be
instructed
give
me
a
chance
pleaded
lafayette
still
in
philadelphia
i
do
not
want
to
be
an
honorary
soldier
he
came
to
camp
and
it
was
a
case
of
friendship
at
first
or
at
least
second
sight
which
would
need
the
pen
of
a
plutarch
to
be
told
in
august
washington
had
been
wondering
what
to
do
with
the
newcomer
on
the
of
november
he
wrote
to
congress
besides
he
is
sensible
discreet
in
his
manner
has
made
great
proficiency
in
our
language
and
from
the
disposition
he
discovered
in
the
battle
of
brandywine
possesses
a
large
share
of
bravery
and
military
ardor
then
it
was
that
washington
had
a
chance
to
learn
what
those
men
really
were
who
had
lodged
so
many
bullets
in
his
coat
on
the
occasion
of
braddock
defeat
not
at
once
but
by
degrees
he
came
to
consider
that
one
peculiar
trait
in
those
former
enemies
made
them
worthy
of
his
friendship
their
aptitude
for
disinterested
enthusiasm
for
a
cherished
idea
not
at
once
early
prejudices
and
associations
had
left
on
him
too
deep
an
imprint
to
be
easily
removed
he
resisted
longer
than
old
franklin
and
with
a
stiffer
pen
than
that
of
the
philadelphia
sage
he
would
note
down
his
persisting
suspicions
and
his
reluctance
to
admit
the
possibility
of
generous
motives
inspiring
the
french
nation
policy
i
have
from
the
first
he
wrote
in
to
his
brother
john
been
among
those
few
who
never
built
much
upon
a
french
war
i
never
did
and
still
do
think
they
never
meant
more
than
to
give
us
a
kind
of
underhand
assistance
that
is
to
supply
us
with
arms
for
our
money
and
trade
this
may
indeed
if
great
britain
has
spirit
and
strength
to
resent
it
bring
on
a
war
but
the
declaration
of
it
on
either
side
must
i
am
convinced
come
from
the
power
it
was
not
however
to
be
so
even
after
france
alone
had
recognized
the
new
nation
and
she
had
actually
begun
war
on
england
washington
remained
unbending
his
heart
would
not
melt
hatred
of
england
he
wrote
may
carry
some
into
an
excess
of
confidence
in
france
i
am
heartily
disposed
to
entertain
the
most
favorable
sentiments
of
our
new
ally
and
to
cherish
them
in
others
to
a
reasonable
degree
but
it
is
a
maxim
founded
on
the
universal
experience
of
mankind
that
no
nation
is
to
be
trusted
farther
than
it
is
bound
by
its
interest
and
no
prudent
statesman
or
politician
will
venture
to
depart
from
it
after
the
declaration
of
independence
envoys
had
been
sent
to
europe
intrusted
with
the
mission
of
securing
the
alliance
not
especially
of
france
but
of
all
nations
who
might
be
touched
by
the
fate
of
the
struggling
colonists
and
inclined
to
help
them
in
their
fight
for
liberty
some
of
the
envoys
were
not
even
admitted
to
the
capitals
of
the
countries
assigned
to
their
efforts
others
received
only
good
words
sent
to
prussia
arthur
lee
who
had
been
previously
refused
admittance
to
madrid
could
reach
the
capital
june
but
not
the
king
there
is
no
name
lee
wrote
appealingly
to
the
monarch
so
highly
respected
among
us
as
that
of
your
majesty
hence
there
is
no
king
the
declaration
of
whose
friendship
would
inspire
our
own
people
with
so
much
courage
but
the
king
would
not
be
persuaded
he
refused
all
help
in
artillery
arms
and
money
though
lee
wrote
to
the
committee
of
foreign
affairs
i
was
well
informed
he
had
a
considerable
sum
in
his
treasury
frederick
would
not
relent
giving
as
a
reason
that
if
he
agreed
the
result
would
be
much
inconvenience
for
himself
he
even
refused
to
receive
lee
whom
he
however
allowed
to
see
his
army
a
mechanism
without
peer
the
american
envoy
wrote
to
washington
but
only
a
mechanism
the
prussian
army
which
amounts
to
horse
and
foot
are
disciplined
by
force
of
hourly
exercise
and
caning
to
move
with
a
rapidity
and
order
so
as
to
certainly
exceed
any
troops
in
europe
they
practise
each
day
every
man
is
filed
off
singly
and
passes
in
review
before
different
officers
who
beat
his
limbs
into
the
position
they
think
proper
so
that
the
man
appears
to
be
purely
a
machine
in
the
hand
of
a
workman
the
furthest
frederick
consented
to
go
was
to
cause
lee
to
be
assured
when
he
left
prussia
the
following
month
july
that
he
would
always
receive
with
pleasure
the
news
of
any
english
reverse
to
the
american
appeal
france
alone
answered
for
what
motives
has
been
shown
above
love
of
liberty
rather
than
hatred
of
england
being
the
chief
reason
and
the
rebellious
colonies
being
popular
in
france
not
so
much
because
they
wanted
to
throw
off
an
english
yoke
as
because
they
wanted
to
throw
off
a
yoke
up
to
the
time
when
rochambeau
arrived
washington
had
seen
during
the
war
more
or
less
numerous
specimens
of
the
french
race
but
only
isolated
specimens
he
had
heard
of
what
they
were
doing
as
soldiers
and
sailors
without
himself
seeing
them
in
action
as
gentlemen
and
soldiers
he
held
them
at
that
date
to
be
fit
representatives
of
a
nation
old
in
war
very
strict
in
military
etiquette
and
apt
to
take
fire
where
others
scarcely
seem
warmed
he
noticed
however
after
savannah
that
with
all
that
warmth
they
could
when
put
to
the
test
prove
steady
and
careful
of
their
words
while
he
said
to
general
lincoln
i
regret
the
misfortune
i
feel
a
very
sensible
pleasure
in
contemplating
the
gallant
behavior
of
the
officers
and
men
of
the
french
and
american
army
and
it
adds
not
a
little
to
my
consolation
to
learn
that
instead
of
the
mutual
reproaches
which
often
follow
the
failure
of
enterprises
depending
upon
the
of
troops
of
different
nations
their
confidence
in
and
esteem
of
each
other
is
increased
concerning
the
french
as
sailors
washington
did
not
conceal
however
to
his
intimate
friends
his
misgivings
he
early
felt
that
the
issue
of
the
whole
war
and
the
independence
of
his
country
might
depend
on
an
at
least
momentary
domination
of
the
sea
but
felt
great
doubt
as
to
the
possibility
of
this
goal
being
reached
in
all
probability
he
thought
the
advantage
will
be
on
the
side
of
the
english
and
then
what
would
become
of
america
we
ought
not
to
deceive
ourselves
it
is
an
axiom
that
the
nation
which
has
the
most
extensive
commerce
will
always
have
the
most
powerful
marine
it
is
true
france
in
a
manner
created
a
fleet
in
a
very
short
space
and
this
may
mislead
us
in
the
judgment
we
form
of
her
naval
abilities
we
should
consider
what
was
done
by
france
as
a
violent
and
unnatural
effort
of
the
government
which
for
want
of
sufficient
foundation
can
not
continue
to
operate
proportionable
effects
moreover
though
the
ability
of
her
present
financier
necker
has
done
wonders
france
is
not
a
rich
country
when
rochambeau
came
with
his
troops
on
ternay
fleet
which
carried
numerous
naval
officers
and
sailors
besides
washington
took
so
to
say
personal
contact
with
france
herself
and
was
no
longer
dependent
upon
his
reading
of
hostile
books
his
souvenirs
of
the
colonial
wars
or
his
impression
from
acquaintanceship
with
separate
individuals
the
portraits
in
the
could
less
and
less
be
considered
as
portraits
washington
found
himself
among
men
of
steady
mind
and
courteous
manners
noteworthy
not
only
for
their
fighting
qualities
but
their
sense
of
duty
their
patience
and
endurance
their
desire
to
do
well
as
for
the
troops
they
observed
as
is
well
known
so
strict
a
discipline
that
the
inhabitants
who
expected
nothing
of
the
sort
rather
the
reverse
were
astonished
and
delighted
little
by
little
washington
heart
was
won
we
did
not
in
that
war
conquer
any
land
for
ourselves
but
we
conquered
washington
for
some
time
more
he
remained
only
officially
ours
the
praise
bestowed
by
him
on
his
allies
and
their
country
found
place
in
his
letters
to
themselves
or
in
his
reports
to
congress
which
were
in
fact
public
documents
at
last
the
day
came
when
writing
only
for
himself
in
a
journal
not
meant
to
be
seen
by
anybody
he
inscribed
those
three
words
our
generous
allies
that
day
may
washington
heart
was
really
won
from
that
moment
what
washington
wrote
concerning
the
french
were
it
addressed
to
themselves
or
to
congress
can
be
taken
at
its
face
value
and
very
pleasant
reading
it
is
to
this
day
for
the
compatriots
of
those
officers
and
soldiers
who
had
the
great
man
for
their
such
statements
as
this
one
for
example
sent
to
congress
seven
days
before
the
yorktown
capitulation
i
can
not
but
acknowledge
the
infinite
obligations
i
am
under
to
his
excellency
the
count
de
rochambeau
the
marquis
de
commanding
the
troops
from
the
west
indies
the
other
general
officers
and
indeed
the
officers
of
every
denomination
in
the
french
army
for
the
assistance
which
they
afford
me
the
experience
of
many
of
those
gentlemen
in
the
business
before
us
is
of
the
utmost
advantage
in
the
present
operation
the
greatest
harmony
prevails
between
the
two
armies
they
seem
actuated
by
one
spirit
that
of
supporting
the
honor
of
the
allied
armies
when
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
the
two
armies
which
have
never
met
since
were
about
to
part
their
leader
thus
summed
up
his
impressions
it
may
i
believe
with
much
truth
be
said
that
a
greater
harmony
between
two
armies
never
subsisted
than
that
which
has
prevailed
between
the
french
and
americans
since
the
first
junction
of
them
last
year
by
the
beginning
of
peace
and
american
independence
had
been
practically
secured
washington
is
found
duly
solemnizing
the
anniversary
of
the
french
alliance
which
had
rendered
those
events
possible
i
intended
he
says
to
general
greene
to
have
wrote
you
a
long
letter
on
sundry
matters
but
major
burnet
popped
in
unexpectedly
at
a
time
when
i
was
preparing
for
the
celebration
of
the
day
and
was
just
going
to
a
review
of
the
troops
previous
to
the
de
the
orders
issued
by
him
on
the
occasion
read
thus
the
who
wishes
on
the
return
of
this
auspicious
day
to
diffuse
the
feelings
of
gratitude
and
pleasure
as
extensively
as
possible
is
pleased
to
grant
a
full
and
free
pardon
to
all
military
prisoners
now
in
confinement
the
orderly
book
used
by
washington
is
still
in
existence
and
from
it
we
learn
that
the
parole
given
for
the
day
was
america
and
france
and
the
countersigns
united
forever
iii
no
less
characteristic
of
washington
sentiments
thereafter
is
the
correspondence
continued
by
him
with
a
number
of
french
people
when
the
war
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
no
further
help
could
be
needed
with
rochambeau
with
chastellux
la
luzerne
then
ambassador
in
london
whom
he
had
seen
with
keen
regret
leave
the
united
states
and
of
course
with
lafayette
he
kept
up
a
correspondence
which
affords
most
pleasant
reading
a
friend
writes
to
his
friends
and
tells
them
of
his
feelings
and
expectations
the
attitude
of
france
at
the
peace
is
the
subject
of
a
noble
letter
to
la
luzerne
the
part
your
excellency
has
acted
in
the
cause
of
america
and
the
great
and
benevolent
share
you
have
taken
in
the
establishment
of
her
independence
are
deeply
impressed
on
my
mind
and
will
not
be
effaced
from
my
remembrance
or
that
of
the
citizens
of
america
the
articles
of
the
general
treaty
do
not
appear
so
favorable
to
france
in
point
of
territorial
acquisitions
as
they
do
to
the
other
powers
but
the
magnanimous
and
disinterested
scale
of
action
which
that
great
nation
has
exhibited
to
the
world
during
this
war
and
at
the
conclusion
of
peace
will
insure
to
the
king
and
nation
that
reputation
which
will
be
of
more
consequence
to
them
than
every
other
consideration
washington
keeps
his
french
friends
aware
of
the
progress
of
the
country
and
of
his
hopes
for
its
greatness
he
wants
to
visit
the
united
states
to
the
limit
of
what
was
then
the
extreme
west
prompted
by
these
actual
observations
he
writes
to
chastellux
i
could
not
help
taking
a
more
contemplative
and
extensive
view
of
the
vast
inland
navigation
of
these
united
states
from
maps
and
the
information
of
others
and
could
not
but
be
struck
with
the
immense
diffusion
and
importance
of
it
and
with
the
goodness
of
that
providence
which
has
dealt
her
favors
to
us
with
so
profuse
a
hand
would
to
god
we
may
have
wisdom
enough
to
improve
them
i
shall
not
rest
contented
till
i
have
explored
the
western
country
and
traversed
those
lines
or
great
part
of
them
which
have
given
new
bounds
to
a
new
empire
to
la
luzerne
he
wrote
some
years
later
the
united
states
are
making
great
progress
toward
national
happiness
and
if
it
is
not
attained
here
in
as
high
a
degree
as
human
nature
will
admit
of
i
think
we
may
then
conclude
that
political
happiness
is
unattainable
that
rest
for
which
washington
had
been
longing
i
pant
for
retirement
he
had
written
to
cary
in
june
had
been
granted
him
by
the
end
of
when
the
definitive
treaty
having
been
concluded
he
had
resigned
his
commission
in
the
hands
of
congress
at
annapolis
on
the
of
december
bidding
an
affectionate
farewell
he
said
to
this
august
body
under
whose
orders
i
have
so
long
acted
it
was
at
first
difficult
for
him
to
enjoy
in
his
dear
mount
vernon
that
quiet
life
and
to
get
the
better
he
wrote
to
general
knox
of
my
custom
of
ruminating
as
soon
as
i
waked
in
the
morning
on
the
business
of
the
ensuing
day
and
of
my
surprise
at
finding
after
revolving
many
things
in
my
mind
that
i
was
no
longer
a
public
man
nor
had
anything
to
do
with
public
transactions
but
he
soon
came
to
the
thorough
enjoyment
of
his
peaceful
surroundings
and
happy
family
life
writing
about
his
new
existence
to
rochambeau
and
lafayette
not
without
a
tinge
of
melancholy
as
from
one
whose
life
work
is
a
thing
of
the
past
to
the
man
of
all
men
for
whom
his
manly
heart
felt
most
tenderness
to
lafayette
it
is
that
he
wrote
the
beautiful
letter
of
february
unaware
that
his
rest
was
only
temporary
and
that
he
was
to
become
the
first
president
of
the
country
he
had
given
life
to
at
length
my
dear
marquis
i
am
become
a
private
citizen
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
and
under
the
shadow
of
my
own
vine
and
my
own
free
from
the
bustle
of
a
camp
and
the
busy
scenes
of
public
life
i
am
solacing
myself
with
those
tranquil
enjoyments
of
which
the
soldier
who
is
ever
in
pursuit
of
fame
the
statesman
whose
watchful
days
and
sleepless
nights
are
spent
in
devising
schemes
to
promote
the
welfare
of
his
own
perhaps
the
ruin
of
other
countries
as
if
the
globe
was
insufficient
for
us
all
can
have
very
little
conception
i
have
not
only
retired
from
all
public
employments
but
i
am
retiring
within
myself
and
shall
be
able
to
view
the
solitary
walk
of
private
life
with
heartfelt
satisfaction
envious
of
none
i
am
determined
to
be
pleased
with
all
and
this
my
dear
friend
being
the
order
for
my
march
i
will
move
gently
down
the
stream
of
life
until
i
sleep
with
my
fathers
with
lafayette
the
great
man
unbends
he
becomes
affectionate
poetical
as
in
the
passage
just
quoted
sometimes
even
jocose
which
was
so
rare
with
him
he
wants
madame
de
lafayette
to
come
to
america
and
visit
mount
vernon
saying
to
her
your
own
doors
do
not
open
to
you
with
more
readiness
than
mine
would
she
never
came
but
her
husband
returned
for
a
few
months
the
same
year
and
this
was
the
first
of
his
two
triumphant
journeys
to
the
freed
united
states
it
was
then
that
he
parted
at
annapolis
from
his
chief
never
to
see
him
again
a
very
sad
parting
for
both
washington
sending
him
from
mount
vernon
in
time
for
it
to
reach
him
before
he
sailed
the
most
touching
perhaps
of
all
his
letters
in
the
moment
of
our
separation
upon
the
road
as
i
travelled
and
every
hour
since
i
have
felt
all
that
love
respect
and
attachment
for
you
which
length
of
years
close
connection
and
your
merits
have
inspired
me
i
often
asked
myself
when
our
carriages
separated
whether
that
was
the
last
sight
i
should
ever
have
of
you
and
though
i
wished
to
say
no
my
fears
answered
yes
i
called
to
mind
the
days
of
my
youth
and
found
they
had
long
since
fled
to
return
no
more
that
i
was
now
descending
the
hill
i
had
been
years
climbing
and
that
though
i
was
blessed
with
a
good
constitution
i
was
of
a
family
and
might
soon
expect
to
be
entombed
in
the
mansion
of
my
fathers
these
thoughts
darkened
the
shades
and
gave
a
gloom
to
the
picture
and
consequently
to
my
prospect
of
seeing
you
again
but
i
will
not
repine
i
have
had
my
day
a
portrait
of
lafayette
his
wife
and
children
was
received
the
following
year
by
washington
and
caused
him
great
pleasure
this
he
said
to
the
sender
i
consider
as
an
invaluable
present
and
shall
give
it
the
best
place
in
my
house
he
continued
to
the
end
to
be
lafayette
confidant
and
adviser
in
one
of
his
most
notable
letters
passing
judgment
on
the
great
warrior
frederick
ii
and
on
his
brother
prince
henry
whom
lafayette
had
recently
visited
he
clearly
outlined
what
should
be
his
ideal
as
to
the
government
of
men
to
be
received
he
says
by
the
king
of
prussia
and
prince
henry
his
brother
who
as
soldiers
and
politicians
yield
the
palm
to
none
with
such
marks
of
attention
and
distinction
was
as
indicative
of
their
discernment
as
it
is
of
your
merit
it
is
to
be
lamented
however
that
great
characters
are
seldom
without
a
blot
that
one
man
should
tyrannize
over
millions
will
always
be
a
shade
in
that
of
the
former
while
it
is
pleasing
to
hear
that
due
regards
to
the
rights
of
mankind
is
characteristic
of
the
latter
during
those
years
of
comparative
rest
only
comparative
for
he
had
to
receive
innumerable
visitors
to
answer
an
unbelievable
quantity
of
letters
because
everybody
wanted
his
counsels
to
take
part
in
the
framing
of
the
constitution
as
a
delegate
of
virginia
in
his
fame
went
on
increasing
in
france
from
whence
tokens
of
admiration
came
for
him
of
every
kind
some
noble
some
simple
some
like
that
letter
from
the
chevalier
de
lormerie
who
made
bold
to
present
a
of
perpetual
to
a
general
who
is
even
more
of
a
philosopher
than
a
warrior
besides
letters
french
visitors
would
now
and
then
appear
at
the
door
of
mount
vernon
one
did
so
by
appointment
and
even
in
virtue
of
a
law
namely
jean
antoine
houdon
the
famous
sculptor
whose
coming
was
the
result
of
an
act
passed
by
the
assembly
of
virginia
prescribing
that
the
executive
be
requested
to
take
measures
for
procuring
a
statue
of
general
washington
to
be
of
the
finest
marble
and
the
best
workmanship
the
sculptor
might
be
of
any
nationality
provided
he
were
the
best
alive
the
intention
of
the
assembly
the
governor
informed
jefferson
then
in
paris
is
that
the
statue
should
be
the
work
of
the
most
masterly
hand
i
shall
therefore
leave
it
to
you
to
find
out
the
best
in
any
of
the
european
states
once
more
it
was
france
good
fortune
to
be
able
to
answer
the
executive
governor
harrison
not
versed
in
matters
artistic
had
thought
that
all
a
sculptor
could
need
to
perform
his
task
was
a
painted
portrait
of
the
model
so
he
ordered
one
from
peale
which
would
he
thought
enable
the
artist
to
finish
his
work
in
the
most
perfect
manner
houdon
decided
that
he
would
rather
undertake
the
journey
insisting
only
that
as
he
was
the
support
of
his
father
mother
and
sisters
his
life
be
insured
a
condition
which
owing
to
the
risks
was
not
fulfilled
without
difficulty
it
finally
was
however
so
that
we
know
to
a
cent
what
the
life
of
the
great
sculptor
was
worth
it
was
worth
two
thousand
dollars
houdon
came
on
the
same
ship
which
brought
back
franklin
after
his
long
mission
to
france
and
he
reached
mount
vernon
on
october
having
been
preceded
by
a
letter
in
which
jefferson
had
thus
described
him
to
washington
i
have
spoken
of
him
as
an
artist
only
but
i
can
assure
you
also
that
as
a
man
he
is
disinterested
generous
candid
and
panting
for
glory
in
every
circumstance
meriting
your
good
opinion
he
remained
at
mount
vernon
a
fortnight
an
interpreter
having
been
provided
from
alexandria
for
the
occasion
the
antique
costume
with
which
the
artist
and
the
model
had
been
threatened
at
one
time
was
discarded
washington
was
represented
not
as
a
greek
which
he
was
not
but
as
an
american
general
which
he
was
the
size
being
precisely
that
of
life
any
one
who
wants
to
see
with
his
eyes
george
washington
to
live
in
his
atmosphere
to
receive
the
moral
benefit
of
a
great
man
presence
has
only
to
go
to
richmond
to
those
who
know
how
to
listen
the
statue
will
know
how
to
speak
no
work
of
art
in
the
whole
united
states
is
of
greater
worth
and
interest
than
this
one
and
no
copy
gives
an
adequate
idea
of
the
original
copies
being
further
from
the
statue
than
the
statue
was
from
the
model
one
must
go
to
richmond
unfortunately
no
notes
on
his
journey
and
on
his
stay
at
mount
vernon
were
left
by
houdon
as
was
usual
with
him
what
he
had
to
say
he
said
in
marble
other
french
visitors
of
more
or
less
note
called
at
mount
vernon
popular
in
france
even
at
the
time
of
their
worst
troubles
when
failure
seemed
threatening
the
united
states
were
much
more
so
now
and
men
wanted
to
go
and
see
with
their
own
eyes
what
was
the
power
of
liberty
and
whether
it
could
as
reported
transform
a
country
into
an
eden
and
cities
into
modern
salentes
the
year
of
the
alliance
sébastien
mercier
in
his
la
had
drawn
up
a
picture
of
the
french
people
expectation
perhaps
it
is
in
america
that
the
human
race
will
transform
itself
adopt
a
new
and
sublime
religion
improve
sciences
and
arts
and
become
the
representative
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
a
haven
of
liberty
grecian
souls
all
strong
and
generous
souls
will
develop
or
meet
there
and
this
great
example
given
to
the
universe
will
show
what
men
can
do
when
they
are
of
one
mind
and
combine
their
lights
and
their
courage
turgot
as
mentioned
before
had
written
in
the
same
strain
the
same
year
the
results
of
the
war
had
increased
those
hopes
the
success
of
the
unprecedented
crusade
for
liberty
caused
an
enthusiasm
which
found
its
expression
in
verse
and
prose
the
very
year
of
the
treaty
securing
independence
an
epic
poem
was
published
written
in
french
alexandrine
verse
divided
into
cantos
adorned
with
all
the
machinery
of
the
greek
models

and

reaching

amid

benedictions
in

you

you
do
not

those

that

the

is
held

fifty
years
from

it
will
have
learned
from
you
whether
modern

can
preserve
republican

whether

are
compatible
with
the
great
progress
of
civilization
and
whether
america
is
meant
to
improve
or
to
aggravate
the
fate
of

this
sense
of
the
responsibility
of
the
new
republic
toward
mankind
of
the
future
and
of
the
importance
for
all
nations
of
its
success
or
failure
caused
french
thinkers
to
concern
themselves
with
the
problem
to
express
faith
and
admiration
but
to
submit
also
such
recommendations
as
their
studies
of
humanity
past
made
them
consider
of
use
the
on
the
government
and
the
laws
of
the
united
of
modest
liberal
and
abbé
de
mably
are
for
example
the
outcome
of
such
reflections
the
visitor
most
representative
of
the
views
thus
prevalent
in
the
french
nation
knocked
at
the
gate
of
mount
vernon
provided
with
that
infallible
a
letter
of
introduction
from
lafayette
this
gentleman
the
letter
read
intends
to
write
a
history
of
america
and
you
would
therefore
make
him
very
happy
if
you
allowed
him
to
glance
at
your
papers
he
seems
to
deserve
this
favor
since
he
loves
america
very
much
writes
well
and
will
represent
things
under
their
true
light
the
bearer
a
sincere
admirer
and
friend
of
the
new
republic
and
who
had
the
advantage
of
speaking
english
fluently
was
brissot
so
famous
shortly
after
for
the
part
he
played
in
the
french
revolution
then
already
penetrated
with
its
principles
and
having
written
young
as
he
was
on
the
reform
of
criminal
laws
declared
in
favor
of
the
emancipation
of
the
jews
founded
a
society
of
the
friends
of
the
blacks
and
what
is
more
to
the
point
a
first
of
its
kind
for
the
members
thereof
to
exchange
views
on
the
common
interests
of
france
and
the
united
states
to
become
a
member
one
had
to
prove
able
and
willing
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
others
universal
ideas
on
the
happiness
of
man
and
societies
because
though
its
special
and
titular
object
be
the
interest
of
france
and
the
united
states
nevertheless
it
fully
embraces
in
its
considerations
the
happiness
of
mankind
in
which
appears
the
vastness
of
humanitarian
plans
so
fondly
cherished
among
us
six
years
before
the
reign
of
terror
the
particular
object
of
the
association
was
however
to
help
the
two
countries
to
better
know
each
other
which
can
only
be
realized
by
bringing
nearer
together
the
french
individual
and
the
american
individual
books
were
to
be
published
by
the
society
the
first
one
to
be
dedicated
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
friends
of
america
in
the
two
worlds
newspapers
books
the
texts
of
laws
the
journals
of
congress
were
to
be
imported
from
free
america
the
society
would
welcome
americans
whom
their
business
should
call
to
france
and
whose
knowledge
would
enable
them
to
impart
useful
information
there
nothing
more
natural
since
the
aim
of
the
society
was
the
welfare
of
the
two
nations
lafayette
and
jefferson
had
been
asked
to
join
one
of
the
founders
was
de
crèvecœur
already
known
by
his
from
an
american
who
when
he
left
france
to
return
to
the
united
states
was
intrusted
with
the
care
of
making
the
society
known
to
the
americans
availing
himself
of
newspapers
or
of
other
means
his
expenses
if
any
to
be
repaid
but
the
very
active
in
other
matters
proved
in
this
one
very
remiss
brissot
reached
boston
in
july
and
found
that
america
was
exactly
what
he
had
expected
it
to
be
sanctuary
of
liberty
he
wrote
on
landing
i
salute
thee
would
to
heaven
thou
wert
nearer
europe
fewer
friends
of
liberty
would
vainly
bewail
its
absence
there
the
inhabitants
he
wrote
have
an
air
of
simplicity
and
kindness
but
they
are
full
of
human
dignity
conscious
of
their
liberty
and
seeing
in
all
men
their
brothers
and
equals
i
thought
i
was
in
that
salente
so
attractively
depicted
by
fénelon
equality
is
what
strikes
him
most
as
it
does
the
mass
of
his
compatriots
this
was
the
particularly
american
trait
which
as
mentioned
before
was
imported
from
the
united
states
into
france
on
the
eve
of
our
revolution
luxury
the
visitor
admits
is
of
course
a
danger
but
they
know
it
and
arm
against
it
the
most
respectable
inhabitants
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
have
formed
a
society
to
prevent
the
increase
of
luxury
an
attempt
which
however
never
succeeded
but
at
salente
after
having
seen
the
chief
cities
and
paid
a
visit
to
franklin
found
very
ill
but
with
his
great
mind
unimpaired
brissot
reached
mount
vernon
in
november
and
remained
there
three
days
different
from
houdon
he
luckily
took
notes
on
the
place
and
on
the
inhabitants
thereof
the
general
arrived
only
in
the
evening
he
returned
very
tired
from
a
tour
over
part
of
his
domains
where
he
was
having
a
road
traced
you
have
often
heard
him
compared
to
cincinnatus
the
comparison
is
a
just
one
this
celebrated
general
is
now
but
a
good
farmer
ever
busy
with
his
farm
as
he
calls
it
improving
cultivation
and
building
barns
he
showed
me
one
of
enormous
dimensions
just
being
erected
from
a
plan
sent
him
by
the
famous
english
agriculturist
arthur
young
but
greatly
improved
by
him
all
is
simple
in
the
house
of
the
general
his
table
is
good
without
luxury
regularity
is
everywhere
apparent
in
his
domestic
economy
washington
has
her
eye
on
everything
and
joins
to
the
qualities
of
an
excellent
housekeeper
the
simple
dignity
which
befits
a
woman
whose
husband
has
played
a
great
rôle
she
adds
to
it
that
amenity
those
attentions
toward
strangers
which
lend
so
much
sweetness
to
hospitality
the
same
virtues
shine
in
her
niece
so
interesting
but
who
unluckily
seems
to
be
in
a
very
delicate
state
of
health
as
for
the
general
himself
kindness
appears
in
his
looks
his
eyes
have
no
longer
that
lustre
which
his
officers
noticed
when
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
army
but
they
get
enlivened
in
conversation
good
sense
is
the
dominant
trait
in
all
his
answers
great
discretion
and
diffidence
of
himself
goes
with
it
and
at
the
same
time
a
firm
and
unshakable
disposition
when
he
has
once
made
up
his
mind
his
modesty
is
great
he
talks
of
the
american
war
as
if
he
had
not
been
the
leader
thereof
and
of
his
victories
with
an
indifference
which
strangers
could
not
equal
the
divisions
in
his
country
break
his
heart
he
feels
the
necessity
of
calling
together
all
the
friends
of
liberty
around
one
central
point
the
need
of
imparting
energy
to
the
government
he
is
still
ready
to
give
up
that
quiet
which
causes
his
happiness
he
spoke
to
me
of
de
lafayette
with
emotion
he
considers
him
as
his
child
not
only
on
agriculture
and
government
but
also
on
manners
the
future
president
gave
his
visitor
much
information
the
general
told
me
that
a
great
reform
was
going
on
among
his
compatriots
people
drank
much
less
they
no
longer
forced
their
guests
to
drink
it
had
ceased
to
be
good
form
to
send
them
home
inebriated
those
noisy
parties
at
taverns
so
frequent
in
former
times
were
not
to
be
the
fashion
any
more
dress
was
becoming
simpler
on
receiving
news
of
the
convocation
of
the
french
states
general
brissot
who
felt
that
this
was
the
beginning
of
immense
changes
hastened
back
to
france
and
published
an
account
of
his
journey
he
stated
in
his
preface
written
in
why
he
had
undertaken
it
and
what
lessons
we
might
learn
from
our
neighbors
of
over
the
sea
the
object
of
this
journey
has
not
been
to
study
antique
statues
or
to
find
unknown
plants
but
to
observe
men
who
had
just
conquered
their
liberty
to
frenchmen
free
men
can
no
longer
be
strangers
we
too
have
conquered
our
liberty
we
have
not
to
learn
from
americans
how
to
conquer
it
but
how
to
preserve
it
this
secret
consists
especially
in
morality
what
is
liberty
it
is
the
most
perfect
state
of
society
a
state
in
which
man
depends
only
upon
the
laws
made
by
himself
and
to
make
good
ones
he
must
improve
his
reason
and
to
apply
them
he
must
again
have
recourse
to
his
reason
morals
are
but
reason
applied
to
all
the
acts
of
life
they
are
among
free
men
what
irons
and
gibbets
are
among
peoples
in
slavery
this
journey
will
show
you
the
wondrous
effects
of
liberty
on
morals
on
industry
and
on
the
amelioration
of
men
my
desire
has
been
to
depict
to
my
compatriots
a
people
with
whom
it
behooves
from
every
point
of
view
that
they
become
intimately
united
iv
during
the
early
stages
of
the
french
revolution
washington
had
followed
with
the
keenest
sympathy
and
anxiety
the
efforts
of
our
ancestors
taking
pride
in
the
thought
that
the
american
example
had
something
to
do
as
it
undoubtedly
had
with
what
was
happening
the
young
french
nobility
enrolled
for
the
cause
of
american
independence
wrote
talleyrand
in
his
memoirs
attached
itself
afterward
to
the
principles
it
had
gone
to
fight
for
pontgibaud
who
remained
a
royalist
who
hated
the
revolution
and
became
an
observes
the
same
fact
although
deploring
what
occurred
the
officers
of
count
de
rochambeau
had
nothing
better
to
do
after
yorktown
i
believe
than
to
visit
the
country
when
one
thinks
of
the
false
ideas
of
government
and
philanthropy
with
the
virus
of
which
these
youths
were
infected
in
america
and
which
they
were
to
enthusiastically
propagate
in
france
with
such
lamentable
success
since
that
mania
for
imitation
has
powerfully
helped
toward
the
revolution
without
being
its
unique
cause
people
will
agree
that
all
those
young
philosophers
had
much
better
for
their
sake
and
ours
have
stayed
at
court
each
of
them
fancied
he
would
be
called
upon
to
play
the
part
of
washington
asked
to
join
lafayette
and
his
former
of
beyond
the
sea
he
refused
it
has
been
justly
said
that
in
a
revolution
the
difficulty
lies
not
in
doing
one
duty
but
in
knowing
where
it
is
i
did
mine
because
i
knew
where
it
was
and
he
joined
the
princes
and
emigrated
of
this
american
influence
washington
was
aware
and
spoke
as
may
be
surmised
in
terms
nearer
those
of
talleyrand
than
those
of
pontgibaud
i
am
glad
to
hear
he
wrote
to
jefferson
that
the
des
has
been
productive
of
good
in
france
indeed
the
rights
of
mankind
the
privileges
of
the
people
and
the
true
principles
of
liberty
seem
to
have
been
more
generally
discussed
and
better
understood
throughout
europe
since
the
american
revolution
than
they
were
at
any
former
period
few
of
washington
observations
are
a
greater
credit
to
him
as
a
statesman
than
those
concerning
this
extraordinary
upheaval
from
the
first
he
felt
that
the
change
would
not
prove
a
merely
local
one
but
would
have
consequences
that
in
fact
a
new
era
was
beginning
for
mankind
a
spirit
for
political
improvements
seems
to
be
rapidly
and
extensively
spreading
through
the
european
countries
he
wrote
to
la
luzerne
i
shall
rejoice
in
seeing
the
condition
of
the
human
race
happier
than
ever
it
has
been
but
let
the
people
at
the
helm
be
careful
not
to
make
more
haste
than
good
speed
in
their
innovations
no
less
clearly
did
he
foresee
long
before
the
event
and
when
all
was
hope
and
rejoicing
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
count
upon
a
peaceful
gradual
and
bloodless
development
where
so
many
abuses
had
to
be
corrected
this
however
was
what
as
a
friend
of
france
he
would
have
liked
to
see
and
even
before
the
revolution
had
really
started
he
had
expressed
to
lafayette
in
striking
words
his
wish
that
it
might
prove
a
tacit
one
if
i
were
to
advise
i
should
say
that
great
moderation
should
be
used
on
both
sides
such
a
spirit
seems
to
be
awakened
in
the
kingdom
as
if
managed
with
extreme
prudence
may
produce
a
gradual
and
tacit
revolution
much
in
favor
of
the
subjects
the
movement
is
started
the
bastile
falls
and
lafayette
sends
the
key
thereof
to
his
former
chief
it
is
a
tribute
he
wrote
which
i
owe
as
a
son
to
my
adopted
father
as
an
to
my
general
as
a
missionary
of
liberty
to
its
patriarch
washington
placed
the
key
at
mount
vernon
where
it
is
still
and
returned
thanks
for
this
token
of
victory
gained
by
liberty
over
despotism
the
beginnings
were
promising
the
great
leader
was
full
of
admiration
of
awe
of
apprehension
to
gouverneur
morris
then
american
minister
to
france
president
washington
as
he
now
was
wrote
on
the
of
october
in
these
prophetic
terms
the
revolution
which
has
been
effected
in
france
is
of
so
wonderful
a
nature
that
the
mind
can
hardly
realize
the
fact
if
it
ends
as
our
last
accounts
to
the
of
august
predict
that
nation
will
be
the
most
powerful
and
happy
in
europe
but
i
fear
though
it
has
gone
triumphantly
through
the
first
paroxysm
it
is
not
the
last
it
has
to
encounter
before
matters
are
finally
settled
in
a
word
the
revolution
is
of
too
great
a
magnitude
to
be
effected
in
so
short
a
space
and
with
the
loss
of
so
little
blood
the
mortification
of
the
king
the
intrigues
of
the
queen
and
the
discontent
of
the
princes
and
the
noblesse
will
foment
divisions
if
possible
in
the
national
assembly
the
licentiousness
of
the
people
is
not
less
to
be
feared
to
forbear
running
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
is
no
easy
matter
and
should
this
be
the
case
rocks
and
shoals
not
visible
at
present
may
wreck
the
vessel
the
grandeur
and
importance
of
the
change
fills
him
in
the
meanwhile
with
wonder
in
his
letter
of
april
to
la
luzerne
he
said
indeed
the
whole
business
is
so
extraordinary
in
its
commencement
so
wonderful
in
its
progress
and
may
be
so
stupendous
in
its
consequences
that
i
am
almost
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
one
thing
however
you
may
rest
perfectly
assured
that
nobody
is
more
anxious
for
the
happy
issue
of
that
business
than
i
am
as
nobody
can
wish
more
sincerely
for
the
prosperity
of
the
french
nation
than
i
do
to
another
correspondent
graham
he
described
the
renovation
of
the
french
constitution
as
one
of
the
most
wonderful
events
in
the
history
of
mankind
so
late
as
the
of
october
he
was
writing
to
gouverneur
morris
we
can
only
repeat
the
sincere
wish
that
much
happiness
may
arise
to
the
french
nation
and
to
mankind
in
general
out
of
the
severe
evils
which
are
inseparable
from
so
important
a
revolution
throughout
the
unparalleled
crisis
the
french
friends
of
washington
kept
him
informed
of
events
of
their
hopes
and
fears
letters
have
been
printed
those
of
rochambeau
written
in
his
own
english
have
not
and
many
of
them
are
of
great
interest
the
french
general
had
early
foreseen
the
necessity
for
profound
changes
owing
to
abuses
to
the
excessive
privileges
of
the
few
the
burdens
of
the
many
the
increasing
maladministration
especially
since
necker
had
been
replaced
by
a
devil
of
a
fool
named
calonne
maybe
the
states
general
will
provide
an
adequate
remedy
by
devising
a
constitution
i
hope
very
much
of
this
general
states
to
restore
our
finances
and
to
consolidate
a
good
constitution
but
he
has
doubts
as
to
what
aristocratical
men
will
do
himself
a
member
of
the
assembly
rochambeau
considers
that
there
are
not
in
reality
three
orders
the
nobles
the
clergy
and
the
third
estate
but
two
the
privileged
people
and
the
unprivileged
the
vote
being
in
accordance
with
law
and
custom
taken
per
estate
or
order
the
two
privileged
ones
always
vote
in
the
same
way
and
can
ever
prevail
rochambeau
informs
washington
that
as
for
himself
he
voted
in
favor
of
the
equal
representation
of
the
third
order
your
pupil
lafayette
has
voted
for
the
same
opinion
as
you
may
believe
it
but
we
have
here
a
great
number
of
aristocratical
men
that
are
very
interested
to
perpetuate
the
abuses
he
agrees
with
washington
that
in
order
to
reach
safe
results
developments
should
be
slowly
evolved
but
the
temper
of
the
nation
has
been
wrought
up
and
it
is
moreover
a
fiery
temper
do
you
remember
my
dear
general
he
writes
of
the
first
repast
that
we
have
made
together
at
i
made
you
remark
from
the
soup
the
difference
of
character
of
our
two
nations
the
french
in
burning
their
throat
and
all
the
americans
waiting
wisely
for
the
time
that
it
was
cooled
i
believe
my
dear
general
you
have
seen
since
a
year
that
our
nation
has
not
change
d
of
character
we
go
very
fast
god
will
that
we
reach
our
aims
in
his
moments
of
deepest
anxiety
rochambeau
is
pleased
however
to
remember
a
word
of
the
late
king
of
prussia
frederick
ii
who
considering
what
france
was
what
misfortunes
and
dangers
she
had
encountered
and
what
concealed
sources
of
strength
were
in
her
once
said
to
the
french
minister
accredited
to
him
i
have
been
brought
up
in
the
middle
of
the
unhappiness
of
france
my
cradle
was
surrounded
with
refugee
protestants
that
about
the
end
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
and
the
beginning
of
the
regency
of
the
duc
told
me
that
france
was
at
the
agony
and
could
not
exist
three
years
i
have
known
in
the
course
of
my
reign
that
france
has
such
a
temper
that
there
is
no
bad
minister
nor
bad
generals
who
be
able
to
kill
it
and
that
constitution
has
made
it
rise
again
of
all
its
crises
with
strength
and
vigor
it
wants
no
other
remedy
but
time
and
keep
a
strict
course
of
diet
events
followed
their
course
but
while
everything
else
was
changing
in
france
the
feeling
for
washington
and
the
united
states
remained
the
same
the
two
countries
felt
nearer
than
before
and
showed
it
in
many
ways
at
the
death
of
franklin
the
national
assembly
on
the
proposal
of
mirabeau
went
into
mourning
for
three
days
our
first
constitution
of
was
notified
to
the
american
government
president
washington
the
french
minister
informed
his
chief
received
the
king
letter
with
the
tokens
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
in
accordance
with
your
orders
a
copy
of
the
constitution
and
of
the
king
letter
to
the
national
assembly
was
given
to
him
as
well
as
to
mr
jefferson
tom
paine
though
an
american
or
rather
because
an
american
was
elected
by
several
departments
a
member
of
the
convention
took
his
seat
but
as
he
knew
no
french
had
his
speeches
translated
and
read
for
him
he
played
an
important
part
in
the
drafting
of
our
second
constitution
the
republican
one
of
as
a
sacred
emblem
of
liberty
the
american
flag
was
displayed
in
the
hall
where
the
convention
held
its
sittings
a
quite
extraordinary
decree
was
rendered
by
this
body
in
the
second
year
of
the
republic
after
having
heard
the
petition
of
american
citizens
deciding
and
this
at
a
time
when
everybody
was
liable
to
arrest
that
the
wives
of
american
citizens
whatever
the
place
of
their
birth
should
be
exempted
from
the
law
on
the
arrestation
of
foreigners
the
of
july
was
in
the
meantime
celebrated
in
america
just
as
in
france
as
marking
a
new
progress
in
the
development
of
mankind
our
minister
ternant
gave
dumouriez
a
glowing
account
of
such
a
celebration
it
affords
me
great
satisfaction
to
inform
you
that
in
spite
of
the
news
received
the
day
before
of
the
bad
success
of
our
first
military
operations
the
americans
have
given
on
the
occasion
of
this
anniversary
touching
signs
of
their
attachment
for
france
and
proof
of
the
interest
they
take
in
the
success
of
our
arms
you
will
see
by
the
bulletins
and
newspapers
accompanying
this
letter
that
the
same
sentiments
have
been
manifested
in
almost
all
the
cities
which
count
in
the
union
and
that
the
has
been
celebrated
with
the
same
ardor
as
the
which
is
the
anniversary
of
american
independence
for
the
person
of
the
president
french
tokens
of
veneration
and
friendship
multiplied
in
the
same
year
year
of
the
republic
the
convention
had
conferred
on
him
the
title
of
french
citizen
as
being
one
of
the
benefactors
of
mankind
french
officers
had
united
to
offer
washington
a
dinner
service
each
piece
ornamented
with
a
star
and
her
initials
in
the
centre
and
the
names
of
the
states
in
medallions
around
the
border
the
whole
surrounded
by
a
serpent
biting
its
tail
the
emblem
of
perpetuity
french
dramatists
could
not
wait
until
the
great
man
should
belong
to
the
past
to
make
of
him
the
hero
of
a
tragedy
in
alexandrine
verse
ou
la
liberté
du
nouveau
monde
par
de
performed
for
the
first
time
on
the
theatre
of
the
nation
as
the
comédie
française
was
then
called
on
the
of
july
and
in
which
a
nameless
predecessor
of
mine
de
france
brought
the
play
to
a
conclusion
with
praise
of
washington
of
franklin
of
congress
and
of
the
whole
american
people

and
in
a
kind
of
postscript
the
author
commenting
on
the
events
related
in
his
play
observed
with
truth
the
great
american
revolution
has
been
the
first
result
of
one
greater
still
which
had
taken
place
in
the
empire
of
opinion
of
any
animosity
against
the
english
the
same
comment
offers
no
trace
gloomy
days
succeeded
radiant
ones
past
abuses
danger
from
abroad
general
suffering
passions
let
loose
were
not
conducive
to
that
coolness
and
moderation
which
washington
had
recommended
from
the
first
ternant
had
been
succeeded
as
representative
of
france
by
that
famous
citizen
genet
who
in
spite
of
his
having
some
diplomatic
experience
gathered
as
chargé
in
russia
and
being
in
a
way
a
man
of
parts
an
authority
on
swedes
and
finns
had
his
head
turned
the
moment
he
landed
so
completely
indeed
that
it
is
impossible
in
spite
of
the
gravity
of
the
consequences
involved
not
to
smile
when
reading
his
beaming
despatches
my
journey
from
charleston
to
philadelphia
has
been
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
civic
festivities
and
my
entry
in
philadelphia
a
triumph
for
liberty
true
americans
are
at
the
height
of
joy
in
his
next
letters
he
insists
and
gloats
over
his
own
matchless
deeds
the
whole
of
america
has
risen
to
acknowledge
in
me
the
minister
of
the
french
republic
i
live
in
the
midst
of
perpetual
feasts
i
receive
addresses
from
all
parts
of
the
continent
i
see
with
pleasure
that
my
way
of
negotiating
pleases
our
american
brothers
and
i
am
founded
to
believe
citizen
minister
that
my
mission
will
be
a
fortunate
one
from
every
point
of
view
i
include
herewith
american
gazettes
in
which
i
have
marked
the
articles
concerning
myself
encouraged
by
the
who
thought
they
could
use
him
for
their
own
purposes
genet
shows
scant
respect
for
old
washington
who
greatly
differs
from
him
whose
name
has
been
engraved
by
history
and
who
does
not
pardon
me
my
successes
a
mere
fayettist
he
disdainfully
calls
him
elsewhere
but
genet
will
have
the
better
of
any
such
opposition
i
am
in
the
meantime
provisioning
the
west
indies
i
excite
canadians
to
break
the
british
yoke
i
arm
the
kentukois
and
prepare
a
naval
expedition
which
will
facilitate
their
descent
on
new
orleans
he
had
in
fact
armed
in
american
waters
quite
a
fleet
of
corsairs
revelling
in
the
bestowal
on
them
of
such
names
as
the
the
the
the
de
la
petite
his
triumphs
his
lustre
his
listening
to
addresses
in
his
own
honor
and
reading
articles
in
his
own
praise
his
being
clasped
in
the
arms
of
a
multitude
which
had
rushed
to
meet
him
his
naval
and
military
deeds
were
contrary
to
the
current
belief
the
too
indignation
of
fayettist
washington
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
catastrophe
on
receipt
of
the
very
first
letter
of
the
and
by
return
of
mail
the
foreign
minister
of
the
french
republic
took
the
initiative
and
wrote
him
i
see
that
you
have
been
received
by
an
hospitable
and
people
with
all
the
manifestations
of
friendship
of
which
your
predecessors
had
also
been
the
recipients
you
have
fancied
thereupon
that
it
belonged
to
you
to
lead
the
political
actions
of
this
people
and
make
them
join
our
cause
availing
yourself
of
the
flattering
statements
of
the
charleston
authorities
you
have
thought
fit
to
arm
corsairs
to
organize
recruiting
to
have
prizes
condemned
before
even
having
been
recognized
by
the
american
government
before
having
its
assent
nay
with
the
certitude
of
its
disapproval
you
invoke
your
instructions
from
the
exécutif
of
the
republic
but
your
instructions
enjoin
upon
you
quite
the
reverse
they
order
you
to
treat
with
the
not
with
a
of
the
people
to
be
for
congress
the
spokesman
of
the
french
republic
and
not
the
leader
of
an
american
party
the
diplomat
relations
with
washington
are
the
opposite
of
what
france
desires
you
say
that
washington
not
pardon
you
your
successes
and
that
he
hampers
your
moves
in
a
thousand
you
are
ordered
to
treat
with
the
american
government
there
only
can
you
attain
real
successes
all
the
others
are
illusory
and
contrary
to
the
interests
of
your
country
dazzled
by
a
false
popularity
you
have
estranged
the
only
man
who
should
represent
for
you
the
american
people
and
if
your
action
is
hampered
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
while
this
letter
was
slowly
crossing
the
ocean
others
from
genet
were
on
the
way
to
france
written
in
the
same
beaming
style
he
continued
to
gloat
over
his
successes
and
mercilessly
to
abuse
all
federalists
those
confessed
partisans
of
monocracy
people
were
not
for
at
paris
in
those
terrible
days
instead
of
prolonging
a
useless
epistolary
correspondence
the
committee
of
public
safety
rendered
a
decree
providing
that
a
commission
would
be
sent
to
philadelphia
with
powers
to
disavow
the
criminal
conduct
of
genet
to
disarm
his
and
other
corsairs
to
revoke
all
consuls
who
had
taken
part
in
such
armaments
and
as
for
genet
himself
to
have
him
arrested
and
sent
back
to
france
what
such
an
arrest
meant
was
made
evident
by
the
signatures
at
the
foot
of
the
decree
barère
hérault
robespierre
collot
better
than
any
one
genet
knew
the
meaning
but
that
same
government
which
he
had
abused
was
generous
and
protected
him
we
wanted
his
dismissal
not
his
punishment
said
secretary
of
state
randolph
who
refused
to
have
him
arrested
genet
hastened
to
give
up
a
country
so
hard
to
please
he
thought
as
that
of
his
birth
became
an
american
and
as
with
all
his
faults
he
was
not
without
some
merits
being
welcomed
in
many
families
and
especially
in
the
house
of
general
clinton
governor
he
wrote
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
chief
of
the
party
he
married
his
daughter
and
died
at
schodack
a
respected
citizen
and
agriculturist
in
his
name
has
once
more
prominently
appeared
and
in
the
most
honorable
fashion
in
those
gazettes
whose
articles
in
his
favor
pleased
him
so
much
a
descendant
of
his
has
enlisted
for
the
old
country
during
the
present
war
and
has
cast
lustre
on
the
name
by
his
bravery
the
last
years
of
the
former
of
the
american
and
french
armies
were
saddened
by
difficulties
troubles
and
quarrels
with
american
political
parties
and
with
the
french
nation
the
jay
treaty
with
england
november
had
raised
a
storm
at
present
the
cry
against
the
treaty
is
like
that
against
a
mad
dog
and
every
one
in
a
manner
is
running
it
down
the
string
which
is
most
played
on
because
it
strikes
with
most
force
the
popular
ear
is
the
violation
as
they
term
it
of
our
engagements
with
france
were
indignant
the
french
not
at
all
pleased
and
their
captures
and
seizures
coupled
with
a
desire
to
be
allowed
which
they
were
not
to
sell
their
prizes
in
american
harbors
increased
the
discontent
the
opposition
press
was
unspeakably
virulent
and
the
great
man
sadly
confessed
he
would
never
have
believed
that
he
said
every
act
of
his
administration
would
be
tortured
and
the
grossest
and
most
insidious
misrepresentations
of
them
be
made
by
giving
one
side
only
of
a
subject
and
that
too
in
such
exaggerated
and
indecent
terms
as
could
scarcely
be
applied
to
a
nero
a
notorious
defaulter
or
even
to
a
common
pickpocket
the
time
came
at
last
for
his
definitive
retreat
to
mount
vernon
he
reached
it
a
saddened
grand
old
man
longing
to
be
at
last
an
american
farmer
and
nothing
more
and
never
to
go
beyond
twenty
miles
from
his
home
to
make
and
sell
a
little
flour
annually
to
repair
houses
going
fast
to
ruin
to
build
one
for
the
security
of
my
papers
of
a
public
nature
and
to
amuse
myself
in
agricultural
and
rural
pursuits
will
constitute
employment
for
the
few
years
i
have
to
remain
on
this
terrestrial
globe
his
desire
was
to
continue
to
the
end
in
the
regular
occupations
he
describes
to
mchenry
in
a
letter
giving
us
the
best
picture
we
have
of
everyday
life
at
mount
vernon
wondering
what
he
might
say
that
would
interest
a
secretary
of
war
he
writes
i
might
tell
him
that
i
begin
my
diurnal
course
with
the
sun
that
if
my
hirelings
are
not
at
their
places
at
that
time
i
send
them
messages
expressive
of
my
sorrow
for
their
indisposition
that
having
put
these
wheels
in
motion
i
examine
the
state
of
things
further
and
the
more
they
are
probed
the
deeper
i
find
the
wounds
are
which
my
buildings
have
sustained
by
an
absence
and
neglect
of
eight
years
by
the
time
i
have
accomplished
these
matters
breakfast
a
little
after
seven
about
the
time
i
presume
you
are
taking
leave
of
mchenry
is
ready
that
this
being
over
i
mount
my
horse
and
ride
round
my
farms
which
employs
me
until
it
is
time
to
dress
for
dinner
at
which
i
rarely
miss
seeing
strange
faces
come
as
they
say
out
of
respect
for
me
pray
would
not
the
word
curiosity
answer
as
well
and
how
different
this
from
having
a
few
social
friends
at
a
cheerful
board
the
usual
time
of
sitting
at
table
a
walk
and
tea
brings
me
within
the
dawn
of
previous
to
which
if
not
prevented
by
company
i
resolve
that
as
soon
as
the
glimmering
taper
supplies
the
place
of
the
great
luminary
i
will
retire
to
my
and
acknowledge
the
letters
i
have
received
but
when
the
lights
are
brought
i
feel
tired
and
disinclined
to
engage
in
this
work
conceiving
that
the
next
night
will
do
as
well
the
next
comes
and
with
it
the
same
causes
for
postponement
and
effect
and
so
on
it
may
strike
you
that
in
this
detail
no
mention
is
made
of
any
portion
of
time
allotted
for
reading
the
remark
would
be
just
for
i
have
not
looked
into
a
book
since
i
came
home
nor
shall
i
be
able
to
do
it
until
i
have
discharged
my
workmen
probably
not
before
nights
grow
longer
when
possibly
i
may
be
looking
in
doomesday
book
but
in
this
calm
retreat
described
with
a
truth
and
charm
almost
reminding
one
of
william
cowper
familiar
letters
and
where
he
was
to
spend
such
a
small
number
of
years
trouble
as
previously
soon
knocked
at
the
door
it
seemed
at
one
time
as
if
the
former
of
armies
would
have
to
lead
the
americans
against
the
french
in
spite
of
the
preparations
which
he
had
himself
to
superintend
he
refused
to
believe
that
war
would
really
occur
my
mind
never
has
been
alarmed
by
any
fears
of
a
war
with
france
but
in
his
judgments
of
the
french
as
governed
by
the
directoire
washington
was
gradually
receding
toward
the
time
when
he
knew
them
only
through
steele
and
addison
and
had
in
the
read
to
no
he
died
without
knowing
that
the
threatening
clouds
would
soon
be
dispelled
that
the
next
important
event
which
would
count
in
the
annals
of
the
united
states
and
make
their
greatness
secure
would
come
from
those
same
french
people
the
cession
by
them
unexpected
and
not
of
new
orleans
but
of
the
immense
territory
then
called
louisiana
and
that
while
his
feelings
toward
the
french
had
undergone
changes
those
of
the
french
toward
him
had
remained
unaltered
when
the
news
came
that
on
saturday
of
december
the
great
leader
had
passed
away
the
french
republic
went
into
mourning
for
ten
days
officers
wore
crape
flags
were
flown
at
and
the
head
of
the
state
young
bonaparte
issued
an
order
in
which
he
said
washington
is
dead
this
great
man
fought
tyranny
he
established
on
a
safe
basis
the
liberty
of
his
country
his
memory
will
ever
be
dear
to
the
french
people
as
well
as
to
all
the
free
men
of
the
two
worlds
and
especially
to
french
soldiers
who
like
himself
and
the
american
soldiers
fight
now
for
equality
and
liberty
an
impressive
and
unparalleled
ceremony
thereupon
took
place
at
the
invalides
the
temple
of
mars
as
it
was
then
called
detachments
from
the
paris
garrison
lined
the
aisles
all
that
counted
in
the
republic
was
present
bonaparte
included
and
fontanes
the
most
famous
orator
of
the
day
delivered
the
funeral
eulogy
on
the
departed
leader
washington
work
is
scarcely
perfected
he
said
and
it
is
already
surrounded
by
that
veneration
that
is
usually
bestowed
only
on
what
has
been
consecrated
by
time
the
american
revolution
of
which
we
are
contemporaries
seems
now
consolidated
forever
washington
began
it
by
his
energy
and
achieved
it
by
his
moderation
in
rendering
a
public
homage
to
washington
france
pays
a
debt
due
to
him
by
the
two
worlds
in
one
of
the
first
sentences
of
the
oration
england
with
whom
we
were
at
war
was
courteously
associated
to
the
homage
rendered
by
us
to
the
great
man
the
very
nation
said
fontanes
that
recently
called
washington
a
rebel
now
looks
upon
the
emancipation
of
america
as
one
of
those
events
consecrated
by
the
verdict
of
centuries
and
of
history
such
is
the
privilege
of
great
characters
in
the
centre
of
the

bust
of

wreathed
in
flags
and
laurels
years
before

at
philadelphia
on
a
spot
now
marked
by
an
inscription

at

as

motive
the
similitude
of
feelings
between
france
and
that
nation
which
is
sure
to
be
one
day
a
great
nation
and
is
even
now
the
wisest
and
happiest
in
the
world
and
which
mourns
for
the
death
of
the
man
who
did
more
than
any
by
his
courage
and
genius
to
break
her
shackles
and
raise
her
to
the
rank
of
independent
peoples
one
of
the
noblest
lives
which
have
honored
mankind
has
just
passed
into
the
domain
of
history
washington

now
imperishable

consecrated
his
titles
to
it
and
the
posterity
of
a

would

in

if
he
had
added
magnanimity
to
what
there
was
heroical
in
him

if
being
at
the

time
washington
and

he
had
appointed

his
glory

that
of

is
the
symbol
of
modern
liberty
the
name
of
a
politician
the
name
of
a
conqueror
is
no
longer
what
is
wanted
by
the
world
but
the
name
of
the
most
disinterested
of
men
and
the
most
devoted
to
the

of

series
of
lectures

had
delivered
at

during

great
liberal
laboulaye
who
did
so
much
to
make
america
and
the
americans
popular
in
france
wrote
in
his
preface
washington
has
established
a
wise
and
republic
and
he
has
left
to
not
the
fatal
example
of
crime
triumphant
but
a
wholesome
example
of
patriotism
and
virtue
in
less
than
fifty
years
owing
to
the
powerful
sap
of
liberty
we
have
seen
an
empire
arise
having
for
its
base
not
conquest
but
peace
and
industry
an
empire
which
before
the
end
of
the
century
will
be
the
greatest
state
in
the
civilized
world
and
which
if
it
remains
faithful
to
the
thought
of
its
founders
if
ambition
does
not
arrest
the
course
of
its
fortune
will
offer
to
the
world
the
prodigious
sight
of
a
republic
of
one
hundred
million
inhabitants
richer
happier
more
brilliant
than
the
monarchies
of
the
old
world
all
this
is
washington
work
nearer
our
time
joseph
fabre
the
historian
of
joan
of
arc
wrote
this
sage
was
a
wonder
of
reasoned
enthusiasm
of
thoughtful
intrepidity
of
methodical
tenacity
of
circumspect
boldness
facing
from
abroad
oppression
at
home
anarchy
both
vanquished
by
his
calm
genius
v
once
more
now
a
republic
has
been
established
in
france
which
having
we
hope
something
of
the
qualities
of
coolness
and
moderation
that
washington
wanted
us
to
possess
will
we
trust
prove
perpetual
it
has
already
lasted
nearly
half
a
century
an
unexampled
phenomenon
in
the
history
of
europe
no
other
republic
of
such
magnitude
having
thus
survived
in
the
old
world
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
one
twenty
centuries
ago
if
the
great
man
were
to
come
again
we
entertain
a
fond
hope
that
he
would
deem
us
not
undeserving
now
of
the
sympathies
he
bestowed
on
our
ancestors
at
the
period
when
he
was
living
side
by
side
with
them
most
of
the
leading
ideas
followed
by
him
throughout
life
are
those
which
we
try
to
put
in
practise
we
have
our
faults
to
be
sure
we
know
them
others
know
them
too
it
is
not
our
custom
to
conceal
them
far
from
it
may
this
serve
as
an
excuse
for
reviewing
here
by
preference
something
else
than
what
might
occasion
blame
that
equality
of
chances
for
all
which
caused
the
admiration
of
the
early
french
visitors
to
this
country
which
was
one
of
the
chief
things
for
which
washington
had
fought
and
continues
to
be
one
of
the
chief
attractions
offered
to
the
immigrant
by
these
states
has
been
secured
in
the
french
republic
too
where
no
privileges
of
any
sort
remain
the
right
to
vote
is
refused
to
none
taxation
is
the
same
for
all
and
military
service
is
expected
from
everybody
no
principle
had
more
importance
in
the
eyes
of
washington
than
that
of
equal
liberty
what
triumph
for
our
enemies
to
verify
their
predictions
washington
had
written
to
john
jay
in
a
moment
of
depression
when
he
feared
that
what
genet
was
to
call
monocracy
was
in
the
ascendant
what
triumph
for
the
advocates
of
despotism
to
find
that
we
are
unable
of
governing
ourselves
and
that
systems
founded
on
the
basis
of
equal
liberty
are
merely
ideal
and
fallacious
in
france
as
in
the
united
states
the
unique
source
of
power
is
the
will
of
the
people
in
our
search
for
the
solution
of
the
great
problem
which
now
confronts
the
world
that
of
the
relations
of
capital
and
labor
we
endeavor
to
practise
the
admirable
maxim
of
one
of
our
statesmen
of
capital
must
work
labor
must
possess
and
though
we
are
still
remote
from
this
goal
yet
we
have
travelled
so
far
toward
it
that
at
the
present
day
one
out
of
every
two
electors
in
france
is
the
possessor
of
his
own
house
the
development
of
instruction
was
one
of
the
most
cherished
ideas
of
washington
as
it
is
now
of
his
descendants
you
will
agree
with
me
in
opinion
he
said
in
a
speech
to
both
houses
of
congress
in
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
better
deserve
your
patronage
than
the
promotion
of
science
and
literature
knowledge
is
in
every
country
the
surest
basis
of
happiness
instruction
has
become
under
the
republic
obligatory
for
all
in
france
and
is
given
free
of
cost
to
all
not
a
village
not
a
hamlet
lost
in
the
recesses
of
valleys
or
mountains
that
is
without
its
school
the
state
expenditure
for
primary
instruction
during
the
second
empire
amounted
only
to
twelve
million
francs
the
mere
salary
of
alone
is
now
twenty
times
greater
we
try
to
live
up
to
the
old
principle
three
things
should
be
given
free
to
all
air
water
knowledge
and
so
it
is
that
at
the
sorbonne
the
collège
de
france
in
the
provincial
universities
all
one
has
to
do
in
order
to
follow
the
best
courses
of
lectures
is
to
push
open
the
door
the
man
in
the
street
may
come
in
if
he
chooses
just
to
warm
himself
in
winter
or
to
avoid
a
shower
in
summer
let
him
perhaps
he
will
listen
too
very
wisely
being
in
many
ways
very
modern
washington
attached
great
importance
to
inventions
in
a
speech
to
congress
on
january
he
said
i
can
not
forbear
intimating
to
you
the
expediency
of
giving
effectual
encouragement
as
well
to
the
introduction
of
new
and
useful
inventions
from
abroad
as
to
the
exertions
of
skill
and
genius
in
producing
them
at
home
and
of
facilitating
the
intercourse
between
the
distant
parts
of
our
country
by
a
due
attention
to
the
and
the
distances
having
immensely
increased
in
america
as
well
as
means
to
cover
them
these
latter
remarks
are
certainly
still
of
value
with
a
much
less
difficult
problem
to
solve
we
believe
that
in
the
matter
of
and
with
a
system
of
rural
delivery
coextensive
with
the
national
territory
we
would
pass
muster
in
the
presence
of
the
great
man
as
for
inventions
we
hope
that
even
the
compatriots
of
franklin
fulton
whitney
horace
wells
morton
morse
bell
edison
the
wright
brothers
and
many
more
would
consider
that
our
show
is
a
creditable
one
with
jacquard
loom

laws
of
ampère

with

which
is
transforming
our
way
of
life
decentralizing
overcentralized
countries
as
much
as
the
railroads
did
in
the
last
century
and
more
than
all
because
so
beneficent
to
all
with
the
discoveries
of
chevreul
flourens
claude
bernard
laveran
berthelot
and
especially
pasteur
on
the
question
of
the
preservation
of
natural
resources
to
which
and
not
too
soon
so
much
attention
has
been
paid
of
late
washington
had
settled
ideas
so
have
we
ours
being
somewhat
radical
and
embodying
for
mines
especially
the
french
principle
that
what
belongs
to
nobody
belongs
to
everybody
and
by
everybody
must
be
understood
the
nation
concerning
this
problem
and
the
best
way
to
solve
it
washington
sent
once
a
powerful
appeal
to
the
president
of
congress
saying
would
there
be
any
impropriety
do
you
think
sir
in
reserving
for
special
sale
all
mines
minerals
and
salt
springs
in
the
general
grants
of
land
belonging
to
the
united
states
the
public
instead
of
the
few
knowing
ones
might
in
this
case
receive
the
benefits
which
would
result
from
the
sale
of
them
without
infringing
any
rule
of
justice
that
is
known
to
me
one
of
the
most
memorable
and
striking
things
done
by
the
french
republic
is
the
building
of
a
vast
colonial
empire
giving
access
to
undeveloped
sometimes
as
in
dahomey
barbaric
and
sanguinary
races
still
indulging
in
human
sacrifices
washington
has
laid
down
the
rule
of
what
should
be
done
with
respect
to
primitive
races
the
basis
of
our
proceedings
with
the
indian
natives
he
wrote
to
lafayette
has
been
and
shall
be
justice
during
the
period
in
which
i
have
anything
to
do
with
the
administration
of
this
government
our
negotiations
and
transactions
though
many
of
them
are
on
a
small
scale
as
to
the
objects
ought
to
be
governed
by
the
immutable
principles
of
equality
and
addressing
the
catholic
archbishop
of
baltimore
john
carroll
he
again
said
the
most
effectual
means
of
securing
the
permanent
attachment
of
our
savage
neighbors
is
to
convince
them
that
we
are
just
there
is
nothing
we
are
ourselves
more
sincerely
convinced
of
than
that
such
principles
are
the
right
ones
and
should
prevail
that
we
did
not
lose
sight
of
them
in
the
building
of
our
colonial
empire
its
very
vastness
testifies
using
opposite
means
with
so
many
other
tasks
to
attend
to
we
should
have
failed
the
number
of
people
living
under
the
french
flag
is
about
one
hundred
million
now
judging
from
the
testimony
of
independent
witnesses
it
seems
that
on
this
too
we
have
acted
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
the
former
who
had
written
to
lafayette
on
august
let
me
ask
you
my
dear
marquis
in
such
an
enlightened
in
such
a
liberal
age
how
is
it
possible
that
the
great
maritime
powers
of
europe
should
submit
to
pay
an
annual
tribute
to
the
little
piratical
states
of
barbary
would
to
heaven
we
had
a
navy
able
to
reform
those
enemies
to
mankind
or
crush
them
into
the
reform
was
begun
by
decatur
in
and
perfected
by
bourmont
in
on
one
point
washington
was
very
positive
this
leader
of
men
this
warrior
this
winner
of
battles
loathed
war
he
wanted
of
course
his
nation
as
we
want
ours
never
to
be
without
a
military
academy
our
west
point
is
called
and
never
to
be
without
a
solid
permanent
army
for
as
he
said
in
a
speech
to
congress
in
however
pacific
the
general
policy
of
a
nation
may
be
it
ought
never
to
be
without
an
adequate
stock
of
military
knowledge
for
emergencies
war
might
often
depend
not
upon
its
own
choice
of
this
we
are
only
too
well
aware
there
is
scarcely
however
a
question
that
oftener
recurs
under
his
pen
in
his
letters
to
his
french
friends
than
the
care
with
which
wars
should
be
avoided
and
no
hopes
were
more
fondly
cherished
by
him
than
that
some
day
human
quarrels
might
be
settled
otherwise
than
by
bloodshed
to
rochambeau
who
had
informed
him
that
which
had
recently
appeared
in
europe
were
dissipated
soon
it
is
true
to
return
more
threatening
he
expressed
in
his
joy
at
what
he
considered
a
proof
that
mankind
was
becoming
more
enlightened
and
more
humanized
to
his
friend
david
humphreys
he
had
written
from
mount
vernon
july
my
first
wish
is
to
see
this
plague
to
mankind
war
banished
from
off
the
earth
and
the
sons
and
daughters
of
this
world
employed
in
more
pleasing
and
innocent
amusements
than
in
preparing
implements
and
exercising
them
for
the
destruction
of
mankind
rather
than
quarrel
about
territory
let
the
poor
the
needy
the
oppressed
of
the
earth
and
those
who
want
land
resort
to
the
fertile
plains
of
our
western
country
the
land
of
and
there
dwell
in
peace
fulfilling
the
first
and
great
commandment
his
dream
was
of
mankind
one
day
connected
like
one
great
family
in
fraternal
ties
on
this
matter
of
such
paramount
importance
to
all
the
world
and
in
spite
of
so
much
so
very
much
remaining
to
be
done
we
may
i
hope
consider
in
france
that
our
republic
would
deserve
the
approval
of
the
departed
leader
we
have
indeed
vied
with
the
united
states
and
praise
be
rendered
to
empires
and
kingdoms
who
have
played
also
the
part
of
realms
of
in
an
effort
to
find
better
means
than
wars
for
the
settlement
of
human
quarrels
success
could
not
be
expected
at
once
but
it
is
something
to
have
honestly
earnestly
tried
the
great
man
would
have
judged
failures
with
indulgence
for
he
well
knew
how
dispositions
are
to
be
taken
into
account
in
vain
he
had
said
is
it
to
expect
that
our
aim
is
to
be
accomplished
by
fond
wishes
for
peace
and
at
the
present
hour
when
it
seems
to
the
author
of
these
lines
that
as
he
writes
his
ears
are
filled
with
the
sound
of
guns
wafted
by
the
wind
over
the
ocean
what
would
be
the
feeling
of
our
former
commander
if
he
saw
what
is
taking
place
and
the
stand
made
by
the
descendants
of
those
soldiers
intrusted
years
ago
to
his
leadership
perhaps
he
would
think
as
he
did
when
told
by
lafayette
of
a
recent
visit
to
the
of
frederick
ii
of
prussia
to
view
the
several
fields
of
battle
over
which
you
passed
could
not
among
other
sensations
have
failed
to
excite
this
thought
have
fallen
thousands
of
gallant
spirits
to
satisfy
the
ambitions
of
their
sovereign
or
to
support
them
perhaps
in
acts
of
oppression
and
injustice
melancholy
reflection
for
what
wise
purpose
does
providence
permit
this
perhaps
who
knows
considering
the
silent
resolution
abnegation
and
unanimity
with
which
the
whole
people
from
the
day
when
war
was
declared
on
them
by
a
relentless
enemy
tried
to
uphold
the
cause
of
independence
and
liberalism
in
a
conflict
the
leader
might
be
tempted
to
write
once
more
in
the
pages
of
his
private
journal
the
three
words
he
had
written
on
may
who
knows
of
one
thing
we
are
sure
no
approval
could
please
us
more
than
that

the

kept
all
his

an
account
of
the

events
in

the

the

of

is
one
of
the

of

that
she
has
relied
on
the
resources
of

rather
than
those

abraham
lincoln
on
two
tragic
occasions
at
a
century
distance
the
fate
of
the
united
states
has
trembled
in
the
balance
would
they
be
a
free
nation
would
they
continue
to
be
one
nation
a
leader
was
wanted
on
both
occasions
a
very
different
one
in
each
case
this
boon
was
granted
to
the
american
people
who
had
a
washington
when
a
washington
was
needed
and
a
lincoln
when
a
lincoln
could
save
them
neither
would
have
adequately
performed
the
other
task
a
century
of
gradually
increasing
prosperity
had
elapsed
when
came
the
hour
of
the
nation
second
trial
though
it
may
seem
to
us
small
compared
with
what
we
have
seen
in
our
days
the
development
had
been
considerable
the
scattered
colonies
of
yore
had
become
one
of
the
great
powers
of
the
world
with
domains
reaching
from
one
ocean
to
the
other
the
immense
continent
had
been
explored
new
cities
were
dotting
the
wilderness
of
former
days
when
in
france
had
of
her
own
will
ceded
the
louisiana
territories
which
have
been
divided
since
into
fourteen
states
minds
had
been
staggered
many
in
the
senate
had
shown
themselves
averse
to
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
thinking
that
it
might
prove
rather
a
curse
than
a
boon
as
to
louisiana
this
new
immense
unbounded
world
senator
white
of
delaware
had
said
if
it
should
ever
be
incorporated
into
this
union
i
believe
it
will
be
the
greatest
curse
that
could
at
present
befall
us
it
may
be
productive
of
innumerable
evils
and
especially
of
one
that
i
fear
even
to
look
upon
what
the
senator
feared
to
look
upon
was
the
possibility
awful
and
incredible
as
it
might
seem
of
people
being
so
rash
as
to
go
and
live
beyond
the
mississippi
attempts
would
of
course
be
made
he
thought
to
prevent
actions
which
would
entail
such
grave
responsibilities
for
the
government
but
those
meritorious
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
would
probably
fail
it
would
be
as
well
to
pretend
to
inhibit
the
fish
from
swimming
in
the
sea
to
every
man
acquainted
with
the
manner
in
which
our
western
country
has
been
settled
such
an
idea
must
be
chimerical
people
will
go
that
very
population
will
go
that
would
otherwise
occupy
part
of
our
present
territory
the
results
will
be
unspeakable
our
citizens
will
be
removed
to
the
immense
distance
of
two
or
three
thousand
miles
from
the
capital
of
the
union
where
they
will
scarcely
ever
feel
the
rays
of
the
general
government
their
affections
will
be
alienated
they
will
gradually
begin
to
view
us
as
strangers
they
will
form
other
commercial
connections
and
our
interests
will
become
distinct
the
treaty
had
been
ratified
however
and
the
prediction
not
of
senator
white
of
delaware
but
of
senator
jackson
of
georgia
has
proved
true
the
latter
having
stated
in
his
answer
that
if
they
both
could
return
at
the
proper
period
that
is
in
a
century
they
would
find
that
the
region
was
not
as
had
been
forecasted
a
howling
wilderness
but
the
seat
of
science
and
civilization
the
fact
is
that
if
the
two
senators
had
been
able
to
return
at
the
appointed
date
they
would
have
seen
the
exposition
of
louis
progress
had
been
constant
modern
inventions
had
brought
the
remotest
parts
of
the
country
nearer
together
the
telegraph
had
enabled
the
rays
of
the
general
government
to
reach
the
farthest
regions
of
the
territory
that
extraordinary
attempt
the
first
transcontinental
railroad
was
soon
to
be
begun
and
was
to
be
finished
six
years
later
and
now
all
seemed
to
be
in
doubt
again
the
nation
was
young
wealthy
powerful
prosperous
it
had
vast
domains
and
resources
no
enemies
and
yet
it
looked
as
though
her
fate
would
parallel
that
of
the
old
empires
of
which
tacitus
speaks
and
which
without
foes
crumble
to
pieces
under
their
own
weight
within
her
frontiers
elements
of
destruction
or
disruption
had
been
growing
animosities
were
embittered
among
people
equally
brave
bold
and
sure
of
their
rights
the
edifice
raised
by
washington
was
shaking
on
its
base
a
catastrophe
was
at
hand
such
a
one
as
he
had
himself
foreseen
as
possible
from
the
first
slavery
he
had
thought
should
be
gradually
but
thoroughly
abolished
your
late
purchase
he
had
written
to
lafayette
of
an
estate
in
the
colony
of
cayenne
with
a
view
of
emancipating
the
slaves
on
it
is
a
generous
and
noble
proof
of
humanity
would
to
god
a
like
spirit
would
diffuse
itself
generally
into
the
minds
of
the
people
of
this
country
but
i
despair
of
seeing
it
and
to
john
francis
mercer
i
never
mean
unless
some
particular
circumstance
should
compel
me
to
it
to
possess
another
slave
by
purchase
it
being
among
my
first
wishes
to
see
some
plan
adopted
by
which
slavery
in
this
country
may
be
abolished
by
slow
sure
and
imperceptible
degrees
for
many
reasons
the
steadiness
of
the
union
caused
him
anxiety
we
are
known
he
had
written
to
doctor
gordon
by
no
other
character
among
nations
than
as
the
united
states
when
the
bond
of
union
gets
once
broken
everything
ruinous
to
our
future
prospects
is
to
be
apprehended
the
best
that
can
come
of
it
in
my
humble
opinion
is
that
we
shall
sink
into
obscurity
unless
our
civil
broils
should
keep
us
in
remembrance
and
fill
the
page
of
history
with
the
direful
consequences
of
them
the
dread
hour
had
now
struck
and
civil
broils
meant
to
fill
the
page
of
history
were
at
hand
then
it
was
that
in
a
city
of
one
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
not
yet
a
one
chicago
by
name
the
republican
convention
assembled
there
for
the
first
time
met
to
choose
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
on
friday
of
may
selected
a
man
whom
my
predecessor
of
those
days
announcing
in
an
unprinted
report
the
news
to
his
government
described
as
a
man
almost
unknown
abraham
lincoln
and
so
he
was
his
own
party
had
hesitated
to
nominate
him
only
on
the
third
ballot
after
two
others
in
which
he
did
not
lead
the
convention
decided
that
the
fate
of
the
party
of
abolitionism
and
of
the
union
would
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
that
man
almost
unknown
abraham
lincoln
the
of
history
has
since
been
turned
on
the
most
obscure
parts
of
his
career
every
incident
of
it
is
known
many
sayings
of
his
to
which
neither
he
nor
his
hearers
attributed
any
importance
at
the
moment
have
become
household
words
biographies
innumerable
in
pamphlet
form
or
in
many
volumes
have
told
us
of
the
deeds
of
abraham
lincoln
of
his
appearance
of
his
peculiarities
of
his
virtues
and
of
the
part
he
played
in
the
history
of
the
world
not
alone
the
world
of
his
day
but
that
of
for
not
only
the
souvenir
of
his
personality
and
of
his
examples
and
the
consequences
of
what
he
did
survive
among
us
but
so
do
also
a
number
of
his
memorable
guiding
sentences
which
continue
alive
and
active
among
men
his
mind
is
still
living
few
suspected
such
a
future
at
the
time
of
his
election
we
all
remember
wrote
years
later
the
french
academician
the
anxiety
with
which
we
awaited
the
first
words
of
that
president
then
unknown
upon
whom
a
heavy
task
had
fallen
and
from
whose
advent
to
power
might
be
dated
the
ruin
or
regeneration
of
his
country
all
we
knew
was
that
he
had
sprung
from
the
humblest
walks
of
life
that
his
youth
had
been
spent
in
manual
labor
that
he
had
then
risen
by
degrees
in
his
town
in
his
county
and
in
his
state
what
was
this
favorite
of
the
people
democratic
societies
are
liable
to
errors
which
are
fatal
to
them
but
as
soon
as
lincoln
arrived
in
washington
as
soon
as
he
spoke
all
our
doubts
and
fears
were
dissipated
and
it
seemed
to
us
that
destiny
itself
had
pronounced
in
favor
of
the
good
cause
since
in
such
an
emergency
it
had
given
to
the
country
an
honest
man
well
indeed
might
people
have
wondered
and
felt
anxious
when
they
remembered
how
little
training
in
greatest
affairs
the
new
ruler
had
had
and
the
incredible
difficulty
of
the
problems
he
would
have
to
solve
to
solve
his
heart
bleeding
at
the
very
thought
for
he
had
to
fight
not
enemies
but
friends
we
must
not
be
enemies
no
romance
of
adventure
reads
more
like
a
romance
than
the
true
story
of
lincoln
youth
and
of
the
wanderings
of
his
family
from
virginia
to
kentucky
from
kentucky
to
indiana
from
indiana
to
the
state
of
illinois
having
first
to
clear
a
part
of
the
forest
then
to
build
a
doorless
windowless
floorless
log
cabin
with
beds
of
leaves
and
one
room
for
all
the
uses
of
the
nine
inmates
lincoln
the
grandson
of
a
man
killed
by
the
indians
the
son
of
a
father
who
never
succeeded
in
anything
and
whose
utmost
literary
accomplishment
taught
him
by
his
wife
and
which
he
had
in
common
with
the
father
of
shakespeare
consisted
in
bunglingly
writing
his
own
name
the
whole
family
leading
a
life
in
comparison
with
which
that
of
robinson
crusoe
was
one
of
sybaritic
enjoyment
that
in
those
trackless
neighborless
bookless
parts
of
the
country
the
future
president
could
learn
and
educate
himself
was
the
first
great
wonder
of
his
life
his
in
schools
as
primitive
as
the
rest
of
his
surroundings
attended
at
spare
moments
did
not
amount
put
together
to
so
much
as
one
year
during
which
he
learned
as
he
stated
afterward
how
to
read
write
and
cipher
to
the
rule
of
three
but
that
was
all
till
within
his
year
he
was
almost
constantly
handling
that
most
useful
instrument
an
axe
not
a
pen
the
event
proved
once
more
that
learning
does
not
so
much
depend
upon
the
master
teaching
as
upon
the
pupil
desire
this
desire
never
left
him
as
recorded
by
himself
he
nearly
mastered
the
six
books
of
euclid
since
he
was
a
member
of
congress
but
no
book
school
nor
talk
with
refined
men
would
have
taught
him
what
this
rough
life
did
confronted
every
day
and
every
hour
of
the
day
with
problems
which
had
to
be
solved
problems
of
food
of
clothing
of
shelter
of
escaping
disease
ague
and
fever
by
which
they
the
people
of
the
place
were
greatly
discouraged
of
developing
mind
and
body
with
scarcely
any
books
but
those
borrowed
from
distant
neighbors
in
doubt
most
of
the
time
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
wide
world
he
got
the
habit
of
seeing
deciding
and
acting
for
himself
accustomed
from
childhood
to
live
surrounded
by
the
unknown
and
to
meet
the
unexpected
in
a
region
with
many
bears
he
wrote
later
and
other
wild
animals
still
in
the
woods
his
soul
learned
to
be
astonished
at
nothing
and
instead
of
losing
any
time
in
useless
wondering
to
seek
at
once
the
way
out
of
the
difficulty
what
the
forest
what
the
swamp
what
the
river
taught
lincoln
can
not
be
overestimated
after
long
years
of
it
and
shorter
years
at
new
salem
then
at
springfield
at
vandalia
the
former
capital
of
illinois
where
he
met
some
descendants
of
his
precursors
in
the
forest
the
french
coureurs
de
bois
after
years
of
political
apprenticeship
which
had
given
him
but
a
limited
notoriety
almost
suddenly
he
found
himself
transferred
to
the
post
of
greatest
honor
and
greatest
danger
and
what
then
would
say
the
man
almost
unknown
the
backwoodsman
of
yesterday
what
would
he
say
what
did
he
say
the
right
thing
he
was
accustomed
not
to
be
surprised
but
to
ponder
decide
and
act
the
pondering
part
was
misunderstood
by
many
who
never
ceased
in
his
day
to
complain
and
remonstrate
about
his
supposed
hesitancy
many
of
napoleon
generals
and
for
the
same
cause
spoke
with
disgust
at
times
of
their
chief
hesitations
as
if
a
weak
will
were
one
of
his
faults
confronted
with
circumstances
which
were
so
extraordinary
as
to
be
new
to
all
lincoln
was
the
man
least
astonished
in
the
government
his
rough
and
shrewd
instinct
proved
of
better
avail
than
the
clever
minds
of
his
and
seconds
it
was
lincoln
instinct
which
checked
seward
complicated
schemes
and
dangerous
calculations
lincoln
could
not
calculate
so
cleverly
but
he
could
guess
better
in
writing
the
words
quoted
above
was
alluding
to
the
now
famous
first
inaugural
address
but
even
before
lincoln
had
reached
washington
he
had
so
to
say
given
his
measure
passing
through
philadelphia
on
his
way
to
the
capital
he
had
been
entertained
at
independence
hall
and
addressing
the
audience
gathered
there
had
told
how
he
had
often
meditated
on
the
virtues
and
dangers
of
the
men
who
used
to
meet
within
those
walls
in
the
days
when
the
existence
of
the
nation
was
at
stake
and
on
the
famous
declaration
signed
there
by
them
the
purport
of
it
said
the
new
president
is
that
in
due
time
the
weights
should
be
lifted
from
the
shoulders
of
all
men
and
that
all
should
have
an
equal
chance
and
he
added
now
my
friends
can
this
country
be
saved
on
that
basis
if
it
can
i
will
consider
myself
one
of
the
happiest
of
men
in
the
world
if
i
can
help
to
save
it
if
it
can
not
be
saved
upon
that
principle
i
would
rather
be
assassinated
on
this
spot
than
to
surrender
it
france
was
then
an
empire
governed
by
napoleon
iii
during
the
great
struggle
of
four
years
part
of
the
french
people
were
for
the
north
and
part
for
the
south
they
should
not
be
blamed
it
was
the
same
in
america
but
to
a
man
the
increasing
numbers
of
french
liberals
making
ready
for
a
definitive
attempt
at
a
republican
form
of
government
in
their
own
land
were
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
maintenance
of
the
union
the
american
example
was
the
great
one
which
gave
heart
to
our
most
progressive
men
americans
had
proved
that
republican
government
was
possible
in
a
great
modern
country
by
having
one
if
it
broke
to
pieces
so
would
break
the
hopes
of
those
among
us
who
trusted
that
one
day
we
would
have
one
too
as
we
have
these
men
followed
with
dire
anxiety
the
events
in
america
they
had
all
known
lafayette
who
died
only
in
a
lifelong
apostle
of
liberty
and
of
the
american
cause
the
tradition
left
by
him
had
been
continued
by
the
best
thinkers
and
the
most
enlightened
and
generous
minds
france
had
produced
in
the
course
of
the
century
such
men
as
tocqueville
laboulaye
gasparin
pelletan
and
many
others
constant
friends
of
the
united
states
and
stanch
supporters
of
the
liberal
principles
they
had
so
to
say
taken
the
torch
from
the
hands
of
dying
lafayette
and
passed
it
on
to
the
new
generation
tocqueville
who
was
not
to
see
the
great
crisis
had
published
in
with
extraordinary
success
his
work
on
american
democracy
showing
that
individual
liberty
equality
for
all
and
decentralization
were
the
goal
toward
which
mankind
was
steadily
moving
and
that
such
a
system
with
all
its
defects
was
better
than
autocratic
government
with
all
its
guarantees
although
living
under
a
monarchy
he
could
not
help
sneering
at
the
kindness
of
those
omnipotent
governments
who
in
their
paternal
desire
to
spare
the
people
they
govern
all
trouble
would
like
to
spare
them
even
the
trouble
of
thinking
those
who
felt
like
him
eloquently
defended
in
their
books
pamphlets
and
articles
when
the
crisis
came
the
cause
of
the
union
and
strongly
influenced
public
opinion
in
european
countries
such
was
the
case
for
example
with
the
before
of
agénor
de
gasparin
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
states
and
of
confidence
in
the
ultimate
issue
no
said
the
author
in
the
conclusion
of
his
work
published
early
in
the
sixteenth
president
of
the
union
will
not
be
its
last
no
the
year
of
that
nation
will
not
prove
her
last
her
flag
will
come
out
of
the
war
rent
by
bullets
blackened
by
powder
but
more
glorious
than
ever
and
without
having
dropped
in
the
storm
any
of
its
stars
to
gasparin
lincoln
wrote
thereupon
you
are
much
admired
in
america
for
the
ability
of
your
writings
and
much
loved
for
your
generosity
to
us
and
your
devotion
to
liberal
principles
generally
i
am
very
happy
to
know
that
my
course
has
not
conflicted
with
your
judgment
of
propriety
and
policy
i
can
only
say
that
i
have
acted
upon
my
best
convictions
without
selfishness
or
malice
and
that
by
the
help
of
god
i
shall
continue
to
do
so
but
there
were
withal
men
among
us
who
remembering
the
trials
of
our
revolutionary
years
the
most
terrible
any
nation
had
gone
through
inclined
to
consider
that
as
tocqueville
had
said
to
think
was
indeed
a
real
trouble
and
that
thinkers
might
prove
very
troublesome
people
those
men
too
watched
with
care
what
was
going
on
in
america
the
quiet
development
of
the
country
under
democratic
institutions
caused
them
little
enough
joy
as
being
the
actual
condemnation
of
their
most
cherished
theories
they
kept
saying
the
country
has
no
neighbors
it
is
exposed
to
no
storm
any
system
is
good
enough
under
such
exceptional
conditions
if
there
was
any
storm
the
worthlessness
of
such
institutions
would
soon
be
obvious
and
it
had
come
to
pass
that
the
storm
had
arisen
and
that
a
man
almost
unknown
had
been
placed
at
the
helm
then
developed
that
famous
struggle
between
equally
brave
opponents
with
its
various
fortunes
its
miseries
its
hecatombs
and
the
coming
of
days
so
dark
that
it
often
seemed
as
though
there
remained
little
chance
for
the
survival
of
one
great
powerful
united
nation
the
hatreds
were
so
deep
the
losses
so
immense
one
of
the
generals
who
served
the
cause
of
the
union
was
french
and
as
a
colonel
first
commanded
a
regiment
the
new
york
otherwise
called
the
lafayette
guards
in
which
french
blood
predominated
and
who
wore
the
red
trousers
red
képi
and
blue
coats
of
the
french
army
it
was
before
the
war
one
of
those
regiments
whose
functions
owing
to
the
prevalence
of
peace
had
for
a
long
time
been
of
the
least
warlike
mainly
consisting
in
parades
and
banquets
so
much
so
that
with
that
tendency
to
irony
rarely
lacking
in
gauls
those
gardes
lafayette
had
nicknamed
themselves
gardes
la
fourchette
war
came
the
country
was
changed
a
new
spirit
pervaded
the
nation
and
the
gardes
la
fourchette
became
lafayette
again
and
worthy
of
the
name
general
de
trobriand
has
left
a
captivating
account
of
the
campaign
and
of
what
his
first
regiment
did
in
it
beginning
with
military
instruction
hastily
imparted
before
the
start
by
french
sergeants
some
of
whom
had
made
war
in
algeria
others
in
the
crimea
or
italy
familiar
all
of
them
with
field
service
then
the
coming
of
his
soldiers
to
washington
as
yet
a
small
sparsely
peopled
city
with
pennsylvania
avenue
for
its
principal
artery
their
following
rock
creek
not
yet
a
public
park
cadencing
their
march
by
singing
the
or
the
des
hymns
unknown
to
the
echoes
of
the
region
which
repeated
them
for
the
first
time
perhaps
the
last
and
crossing
chain
bridge
to
camp
beyond
the
potomac
on
one
memorable
day
in
the
winter
of
the
regiment
encamped
then
at
tennallytown
entertained
lincoln
himself
the
occasion
was
the
presentation
to
it
by
the
hands
of
the
president
of
two
flags
a
french
and
an
american
one
the
day
chosen
had
been
the
of
january
as
being
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
new
orleans
won
by
andrew
jackson
some
of
whose
troops
were
french
creoles
who
they
too
had
fought
to
the
sound
of
the
lincoln
had
accompanied
the
president
there
was
a
banquet
which
the
regiment
had
had
cooked
by
its
own
who
surpassed
themselves
the
president
heartily
partook
of
the
meal
never
was
he
pleased
to
say
had
he
eaten
so
well
since
he
had
entered
the
white
house
he
wanted
to
taste
of
everything
and
his
gayety
and
good
humor
showed
well
enough
how
much
he
enjoyed
this
diversion
in
the
midst
of
the
anxious
cares
with
which
he
was
oppressed
at
that
moment
there
were
toasts
of
course
the
then
colonel
de
trobriand
drank
to
the
prompt
of
the
union
not
so
prompt
however
that
the
may
not
first
have
time
to
do
something
for
it
on
the
battlefield
president
lincoln
answered
since
the
union
is
not
to
be
before
the
has
had
its
battle
i
drink
to
the
battle
of
the
and
wish
that
it
may
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
the
had
its
battle
and
many
others
too
the
beautiful
american
flag
handed
to
it
on
the
of
january
was
torn
to
shreds
by
at
fredericksburg
only
the
staff
was
left
during
the
course
of
that
terrible
day
even
the
staff
was
broken
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
it
was
also
the
end
of
the
reduced
to
men
it
was
merged
into
the
lincoln
instinct
his
good
sense
his
personal
disinterestedness
his
warmth
of
heart
for
friend
or
foe
his
high
aims
led
him
through
the
awful
years
of
anguish
and
bloodshed
during
which
ceaselessly
increased
the
number
of
fields
dotted
with
tombs
and
no
one
knew
so
great
were
the
odds
whether
there
would
be
one
powerful
nation
or
two
less
powerful
inimical
to
one
another
they
led
him
through
the
worst
and
through
the
best
hours
and
that
of
triumph
found
him
none
other
than
what
he
had
ever
been
before
a
shrewd
man
of
sense
a
convinced
man
of
duty
the
devoted
servant
of
his
country
but
with
deeper
furrows
on
his
face
and
more
melancholy
in
his
heart
we
must
not
be
enemies
a
french
traveller
who
saw
him
at
his
second
inauguration
has
thus
described
him
i
shall
never
forget
the
deep
impression
i
felt
when
i
saw
come
on
to
the
platform
the
great
man
to
whom
the
american
people
had
been
so
happy
as
to
intrust
their
destinies
the
gait
was
heavy
slow
irregular
the
body
long
lean
over
six
feet
with
stooping
shoulders
the
long
arms
of
a
boatman
the
large
hands
of
a
carpenter
extraordinary
hands
with
feet
in
proportion
the
uncovered
the
protruding
muscles
of
a
yellow
neck
above
which
shot
forth
a
mass
of
black
hair
thick
and
bristling
as
a
bunch
of
a
face
of
irresistible
attraction
from
this
coarse
bark
emerged
a
forehead
and
eyes
belonging
to
a
superior
nature
in
this
body
was
sheathed
a
soul
wondrous
by
its
greatness
and
moral
beauty
on
the
brow
with
lines
could
be
detected
the
thoughts
and
anxieties
of
the
statesman
and
in
the
large
black
eyes
deep
and
penetrating
whose
dominant
expression
was
and
kindness
mixed
with
melancholy
one
discovered
an
inexhaustible
charity
giving
to
the
word
its
highest
meaning
that
is
perfect
love
for
mankind
the
nation
was
saved
and
when
the
work
was
done
lincoln
went
to
his
doom
and
fell
as
he
had
long
foreseen
a
victim
to
the
cause
for
which
he
had
fought
when
the
news
of
his
tragic
death
reached
france
the
emotion
was
intense
party
lines
at
that
solemn
hour
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
the
country
was
unanimous
in
the
expression
of
her
horror
the
emperor
and
empress
telegraphed
their
condolences
to
lincoln
the
senate
and
chamber
voted
addresses
of
sympathy
rouher
the
premier
interrupted
by
applause
at
every
word
expressed
himself
as
follows
in
proposing
the
vote
abraham
lincoln
has
displayed
in
the
afflicting
struggle
which
convulses
his
country
that
calm
firmness
which
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
accomplishment
of
great
duties
after
victory
he
had
shown
himself
generous
moderate
and
conciliatory
then
followed
these
remarkable
words
the
first
chastisement
that
providence
inflicts
on
crime
is
to
render
it
powerless
to
retard
the
march
of
good
the
work
of
appeasement
commenced
by
a
great
citizen
will
be
completed
by
the
national
will
addressing
the
chamber
in
the
same
strain
its
president
schneider
said
that
execrable
crime
has
revolted
all
that
is
noble
in
the
heart
of
france
nowhere
has
more
profound
or
more
universal
emotion
been
felt
than
in
our
country
after
having
shown
his
immovable
firmness
in
the
struggle
lincoln
by
the
wisdom
of
his
language
and
of
his
views
seemed
destined
to
bring
about
a
fruitful
and
durable
reconciliation
between
the
sons
of
america
france
ardently
desires
the
of
peace
in
the
midst
of
that
great
nation
her
ally
and
her
friend
but
more
noteworthy
than
all
was
the
feeling
of
unofficial
france
that
of
the
whole
people
trying
to
describe
it
the
american
minister
to
france
but
recently
taken
from
among
us
bigelow
wrote
home
the
press
of
the
metropolis
shows
sufficiently
how
overwhelming
is
the
public
sentiment
and
sending
only
as
samples
a
number
of
testimonials
of
sympathy
received
by
him
he
added
they
will
suffice
to
show
not
only
how
profoundly
the
nation
was
shocked
by
the
dreadful
crime
which
terminated
president
lincoln
earthly
career
but
how
deep
a
hold
he
had
taken
upon
the
respect
and
affections
of
the
french
people
once
more
owing
to
the
death
of
a
great
american
the
whole
nation
had
been
moved
from
french
cities
came
addresses
of
condolence
students
held
meetings
unfavorably
seen
by
the
imperial
police
little
pleased
to
find
how
closely
associated
in
the
sentiments
expressed
therein
were
admiration
for
lincoln
work
and
the
longing
for
a
republic
similar
to
that
over
which
he
had
presided
the
youthful
president
of
such
a
meeting
thus
conveyed
to
bigelow
the
expression
of
what
was
felt
by
the
young
men
of
the
schools
in
president
lincoln
we
mourn
a
fellow
citizen
for
no
country
is
now
inaccessible
and
we
consider
as
ours
that
country
where
there
are
neither
masters
nor
slaves
where
every
man
is
free
or
is
fighting
to
become
free
we
are
the
fellow
citizens
of
john
brown
of
abraham
lincoln
and
of
seward
we
young
people
to
whom
the
future
belongs
must
have
the
courage
to
found
a
true
democracy
and
we
will
have
to
look
beyond
the
ocean
to
learn
how
a
people
who
have
made
themselves
free
can
preserve
their
freedom
the
president
of
the
great
republic
is
dead
but
the
republic
itself
shall
live
forever
deputations
flocked
to
the
american
legation
so
demonstrative
that
the
police
more
than
once
interfered
as
if
to
remind
the
delegates
that
they
were
not
living
as
yet
in
a
land
of
liberty
i
have
been
occupied
most
of
the
afternoon
bigelow
wrote
to
seward
in
receiving
deputations
of
students
and
others
who
have
called
to
testify
their
sorrow
and
sympathy
unfortunately
their
feelings
were
so
demonstrative
in
some
instances
as
to
provoke
the
intervention
of
the
police
who
would
only
allow
them
in
very
limited
numbers
through
the
streets
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
some
have
been
sent
to
prison
in
consequence
of
an
intemperate
expression
of
their
feelings
i
can
now
count
sixteen
policemen
from
my
window
patrolling
about
in
the
neighborhood
who
occasionally
stop
persons
calling
to
see
me
and
in
some
instances
i
am
told
send
them
away
a
unique
thing
happened
unparalleled
anywhere
else
a
subscription
was
opened
to
offer
a
commemorative
medal
in
gold
to
the
unfortunate
widow
and
this
again
did
not
overplease
the
police
the
idea
had
occurred
to
a
provincial
paper
the
de
la
its
success
was
immediate
all
the
great
names
in
the
liberal
party
appeared
on
the
list
of
the
committee

among
them
and
with
his
those
of
etienne
arago
louis
blanc
littré
michelet
pelletan
edgar
quinet
and
others
in
order
to
allow
the
poorer
classes
to
take
part
and
so
as
to
show
that
the
offering
was
a
truly
national
one
the
maximum
for
each
subscriber
was
limited
to
two
cents
the
poorer
classes
took
part
indeed
with
alacrity
the
necessary
sum
was
promptly
collected
the
medal
was
struck
and
it
was
presented
by
eugene
pelletan
to
bigelow
with
these
words
tell
lincoln
that
in
this
little
box
is
the
heart
of
france
the
inscription
in
french
is
an
excellent
summing
up
of
lincoln
character
and
career
dedicated
by
french
democracy
to
lincoln
president
twice
elected
of
the
united
states
lincoln
honest
man
who
abolished

the

the
republic
without
veiling
the
statue

the
french
press
had
been
unanimous
from
the
royalist

to
the
liberal

came
expressions
of
admiration
and
sorrow
by
the

said

think
of
pitying

man

enters
by
the
death
which
he
has
received
in
the
midst
of
the
work

pacification

expressed
with
his
usual
eloquence
and
warmth
of
heart
the
same
sorrow
at
lincoln
death
and
the
same
joy
also
at
the
success
of
a
good
cause
served
by
honorable
means
and
won
by
honest
people
god
is
to
be
thanked
because
according
to
the
surest
accounts
victory
has
remained
pure
unsullied
by
crimes
or
excesses
that
nation
rises
now
to
the
first
rank
among
the
great
peoples
of
the
world
some
used
to
say
do
talk
to
us
of
your
america
with
its
slavery
she
is
now
without
slaves
let
us
talk
of
her
but
happy
as
he
was
at
the
results
montalembert
rendered
nevertheless
full
justice
to
the
south
and
its
great
leaders
the
two
parties
the
two
camps
have
shown
an
equal
courage
the
same
indomitable
tenacity
the
same
wonderful
energy
the
same
spirit
of
sacrifice
all
our
sympathies
are
for
the
north
but
they
in
no
way
diminish
our
admiration
for
the
south
how
not
to
admire
the
southerners
while
regretting
that
such
rare
and
high
qualities
had
not
been
dedicated
to
an
irreproachable
cause
what

and
also
and
especially

that
is
the
service
which
the

have
rendered
to

they
have
rendered
another
equally
important
to
human
dignity

showing
that

powerful

because
he

lincoln
was
indeed
an
honest
man
if
we
give
to
the
word
its
full
meaning
or
rather
the
sublime
sense
which
belongs
to
it
when
honesty
has
to
contend
with
the
severest
trials
which
can
agitate
states
and
with
events
which
have
an
influence
on
the
fate
of
the
world
lincoln
had
but
one
object
in
view
from
the
day
of
his
election
to
that
of
his
death
namely
the
fulfilment
of
his
duty
and
his
imagination
never
carried
him
beyond
it
he
has
fallen
at
the
very
foot
of
the
altar
covering
it
with
his
blood
but
his
work
was
done
and
the
spectacle
of
a
rescued
republic
was
what
he
could
look
upon
with
consolation
when
his
eyes
were
closing
in
death
moreover
he
has
not
lived
for
his
country
alone
since
he
leaves
to
every
one
in
the
world
to
whom
liberty
and
justice
are
dear
a
great
remembrance
and
a
great
example
accounts
of
lincoln
career
multiplied
in
order
to
answer
popular
demand
the
earliest
one
by
achille
arnaud
was
printed
immediately
after
his
death
and
concluded
thus
there
is
in
him
a
more
august
character
than
even
that
of
the
statesman
and
reformer
namely
that
of
the
man
of
duty
he
lived
by
duty
and
for
duty
no
mistake
is
possible
what
europe
honors
in
lincoln
whether
or
not
she
is
aware
of
it
is
she
thus
affirms
that
there
are
not
two
morals
one
for
the
masters
the
other
for
the
slaves
one
for
men
in
public
life
the
other
for
obscure
citizens
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
be
great
never
to
lie
to
oneself
nor
to
others
and
to
be
just
régis
de
trobriand
whose
loyalty
to
lincoln
never
wavered
and
who
had
believed
in
him
even
in
the
darkest
hours
well
saw
the
importance
for
the
whole
world
of
the
issue
of
the
great
conflict
and
justly
stated
that
though
more
directly
concerning
the
united
states
the
fight
had
been
for
those
grand
principles
of
progress
and
liberty
toward
which
modern
societies
naturally
tend
and
to
which
civilized
nations
legitimately
aspire
such
a
cause
is
worth
every
sacrifice
by
defending
it
at
all
costs
the
united
states
have
done
more
than
fulfil
a
task
worthy
of
their
power
and
patriotism
for
their
triumph
is
a
victory
for
mankind
lectures

chairmanship

member
of

showing
that
lincoln
was
not
only
a
superior
type
of
the
american
race
but
one
of
the
highest
and
most
respected
of
the
human
race
something
more
than
a
great
man
a
great
honest
man

of
pendant
and
counterpart
for
the

ceremony

in

at
the
death
of

gave
as
the

of

grand
prize
in
poetry

selected
in
the
year
following
the
event
the
subject
excited
immense
interest
almost
a
hundred
poets
some
of
whom
truth
to
say
were
only
poets
took
part
in
the
competition
which
was
decided
in
several
of
the
productions
proved
of
great
literary
merit
the
prize
went
to
a
former
secretary
of
embassy
edouard
grenier
who
had
already
made
his
mark
as
a
gifted
literary
artist
and
whom
many
of
us
still
remember
a
lovable
old
man
of
upright
ideas
a
model
of
courtesy
counting
only
friends
in
the
very
large
circle
of
his
acquaintances
he
ended
with

the
memory
of
the
great
man
to
whom

are

is
as
fresh
in

just

was

it
is

the

high

observed
that

would
have
a

of

billions

apart

to
the

again
with

the
deciding
motive
had
not
been
that
longing
for

by

by
it
that
we

in

a
sentiment
for
france
and
a
sentiment
enduring
among

is
a
great
and
substantial
fact
to
be
reckoned

their
representative
the
gift
is
offered
in
this
town
of

where
there
exists
a
hall
the
very
name
of
which
is
dear
to
every
american
and
every
french
heart
the
hall
of
independence
and
at
a
gathering
of
a
society
founded
for
promoting
useful
knowledge
which
has
remained
true
to
its
principle
worthy
of
its
founder
and
which
numbers
many
whose
fame
is
equally
great
on
both
sides
of
the
ocean
i
receive
it
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
best
servants
of
the
state
which
this
country
ever
produced
no
less
admired
at
the
head
of
her
diplomacy
now
than
he
was
lately
at
the
head
of
her
army
one
of
those
rare
men
who
prove
the
right
man
whatever
be
the
place
you
have
listened
to
his
words
and
you
will
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
i
shall
have
two
golden
gifts
to
forward
to
my
government
the
medal
and
secretary
speech
the
work
of
art
offered
by
america
to
france
will
be
sent
to
paris
to
be
harbored
in
that
unique
museum
her
museum
of
medals
where
her
history
is
so
to
say
written
in
gold
and
bronze
from
the
fifteenth
century
up
to
now
without
any
ruler
any
great
event
being
omitted
some
of
the
american
past
is
also
written
there
that
period
so
glorious
when
french
and
american
history
were
the
same
history
when
first
rose
a
nation
that
has
never
since
ceased
to
rise
there
awaiting
your
gift
are
preserved
medals
struck
in
france
at
the
very
time
of
the
events
in
honor
of
washington
to
commemorate
the
relief
of
boston
in
a
medal
of
john
paul
jones
in
honor
of
his
naval
campaign
of
another
medal
representing
washington
and
one
representing
general
howard
to
commemorate
the
battle
of
cowpens
in
one
to
celebrate
the
peace
of
and
the
freedom
of
the
thirteen
states
one
of
lafayette
one
of
suffren
who
fought
so
valiantly
on
distant
seas
for
the
same
cause
as
washington
one
lastly
of
franklin
himself
dated
bearing
the
famous
inscription
composed
in
honor
of
the
great
man
by
turgot
eripuit
cælo
fulmen
sceptrumque
tyrannis
my
earnest
hope
is
that
one
of
the
next
medals
to
be
struck
and
added
to
the
series
will
be
one
to
commemorate
the
resurrection
of
that
great
city
which
now
at
this
present
hour
agonizes
by
the
shores
of
the
pacific
the
disaster
of
san
francisco
has
awakened
a
feeling
of
deepest
grief
in
every
french
heart
and
a
feeling
of
admiration
too
for
the
manliness
displayed
by
the
population
during
this
awful
trial
so
that
what
will
be
commemorated
will
not
be
only
the
american
nation
sorrow
but
her
unfailing
heroism
and
energy
now
your
gift
will
be
added
to
the
collection
in
paris
it
will
be
there
in
its
proper
place
the
thousands
who
visit
this
museum
will
be
reminded
by
it
that
the
ties
happily
formed
long
ago
are
neither
broken
nor
distended
and
they
will
contemplate
with
a
veneration
equal
to
that
of
their
ancestors
the
features
of
one
whom
mirabeau
justly
called
one
of
the
heroes
of
mankind

occurred

at

moment
when

was
intense

had

we
meet
on
a
solemn
occasion
one
has
recently
disappeared
from
our
midst
whose
work
was
a
model
whose
life
too
was
a
model
whose
benign
influence
exerted
for
many
years
from
the
seclusion
of
a
quiet
retreat
was
felt
far
beyond
the
limits
of
his
own
country
whose
views
always
expressed
in
the
gentlest
terms
will
outlive
the
thunder
of
many
a
noisy
writer
as
flowers
survive
earthquakes
a
member
of
the
american
philosophical
society
founded
in
his
own
city
by
franklin
to
promote
useful
knowledge
furness
was
true
to
the
motto
of
the
society
and
lived
the
life
of
a
true
philosopher
i
call
him
furness
without
doctor
or
any
other
title
not
because
he
is
no
more
but
to
obey
a
request
of
his
i
do
not
like
titles
in
the
republic
of
letters
he
wrote
me
in
the
early
times
of
our
acquaintance
if
you
will
drop
all
to
me
i
will
do
the
same
to
you
one
touch
of
shakespeare
makes
the
whole
world
kin
all
those
whom
the
spirit
of
philosophy
has
penetrated
and
who
stanchly
adhere
to
its
ideal
count
among
the
noblest
types
of
humanity
and
whatever
their
rank
in
life
or
the
period
when
they
lived
resemble
each
other
when
furness
died
numerous
eulogies
biographies
and
portraits
of
him
penned
many
of
them
by
the
hands
of
masters
were
published
i
wonder
if
any
better
resembled
him
than
this
one
remember
his
constancy
in
the
fulfilling
of
the
dictates
of
reason
the
evenness
of
his
humor
at
all
junctures
the
serenity
of
his
face
his
extreme
gentleness
his
scorn
for
vainglory
his
application
to
penetrate
the
meaning
of
things
he
never
dismissed
any
point
without
having
first
well
examined
and
well
understood
it
he
bore
unjust
reproaches
without
acrimony
he
did
nothing
with
undue
haste
a
foe
to
slander
he
was
neither
hypercritical
nor
suspicious
nor
sophistical
he
was
pleased
with
little
modest
in
his
house
his
clothing
his
food
he
loved
work
ate
soberly
and
thus
was
able
to
busy
himself
for
the
whole
day
with
the
same
problems
let
us
remember
how
constant
and
equable
was
his
friendship
with
what
open
mind
he
accepted
a
frank
contradiction
of
his
own
views
with
what
joy
he
received
advice
that
proved
better
than
his
own
and
the
kind
of
piety
free
from
all
superstition
that
was
his
do
as
he
did
and
your
last
hour
will
be
comforted
as
his
was
by
the
conscience
of
the
good
accomplished
in
those
higher
regions
where
true
philosophers
live
equality
reigns
they
resemble
each
other
by
their
virtues
this
portrait
which
to
my
mind
gives
such
a
vivid
idea
of
the
life
furness
led
at
wallingford
near
philadelphia
was
drawn
eighteen
centuries
ago
by
that
noblest
of
antique
minds
emperor
marcus
aurelius
describing
his
predecessor
the
first
of
the
antonines
he
who
on
the
last
night
of
his
life
being
asked
for
the
password
had
answered
æquanimitas
after
studies
at
harvard
and
philadelphia
and
a
visit
to
europe
and
the
levant
having
taken
such
part
in
the
civil
war
as
his
infirmity
allowed
him
a
happy
husband
a
happy
father
horace
howard
furness
decided
to
devote
his
life
to
the
promotion
of
useful
knowledge
he
withdrew
in
a
way
from
the
world
settling
in
a
quiet
retreat
and
started
on
his
life
work
with
the
equipment
of
a
modern
scientist
and
the
silent
enthusiasm
the
indefatigable
energy
of
mediæval
thinkers
the
compilers
of
of
times
gone
regretting
nothing
happy
with
his
lot
at
one
with
that
master
mind
of
old
english
literature
the
author
of
for
said
centuries
ago
the
man
robed
in
russet
if
heaven
be
on
this
erthe
and
ese
to
any
soule
it
is

or
in

cometh
no
man
to
chide
ne
to
fihte
but
all
is
buxomnesse
there
and
bokes
to
rede
and
to
lerne
such
a
cloister
with
ease
to
his
soul
with
buxomness
with
books
to
read
and
learn
was
for
our
departed
friend
his
house
in
wallingford
where
he
lived
surrounded
by
that
extraordinarily
gifted
family
of
his
a
wife
to
whom
we
owe
the
concordance
to
the
poems
of
shakespeare
a
sister
who
translated
for
him
the
german
critics
sons
and
a
daughter
and
a
sister
relative
who
have
all
made
their
mark
in
their
country
literature
there
for
years
he
toiled
never
thinking
of
self
nor
of
fame
busy
with
his
task
and
even
in
his
seclusion
with
his
tenderness
of
heart
and
ample
sympathies
listening
to
the
still
sad
music
of
humanity
what
that
task
was
all
the
world
now
knows
a
passionate
admirer
of
shakespeare
he
wanted
to
make
accessible
to
all
every
criticism
information
comment
explanation
concerning
the
poet
which
had
appeared
anywhere
at
any
time
each
volume
was
to
be
a
complete
encyclopædia
of
all
that
concerned
each
play
the
first
appeared
in
the
sixteenth
is
the
last
he
will
have
put
his
hand
to
in
the
introduction
to
each
volume
his
purposes
and
methods
are
explained
and
never
has
any
writer
more
completely
and
more
unwittingly
allowed
us
to
look
into
his
own
character
than
furness
when
writing
what
he
must
have
considered
his
very
impersonal
statements
what
strikes
the
reader
before
all
is
the
philosophical
spirit
which
pervades
the
whole
work
a
worthy
member
of
the
american
philosophical
society
he
wanted
to
be
useful
lives
are
and
will
be
more
and
more
encumbered
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
should
therefore
be
made
more
and
more
easy
of
reach
to
abridge
the
labor
and
to
save
the
time
of
others
was
said
he
in
his
first
volume
what
impelled
him
to
write
no
pains
of
his
were
spared
to
lessen
those
of
others
and
all
specialists
know
the
extraordinary
reliability
of
his
texts
and
statements
nowhere
perhaps
sir
sidney
lee
wrote
in
his
of
has
more
labor
been
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
works
of
the
poet
than
that
given
by
furness
of
philadelphia
to
the
preparation
of
the
new
variorum
edition
the
labor
was
one
of
love
and
a
lover
naturally
forgets
himself
for
the
beloved
one
furness
tried
not
to
show
the
ardor
of
his
sentiments
but
it
now
and
then
appears
usually
in
small
details
when
he
would
more
naturally
be
off
his
guard
shakespeare
calls
cæsar
ambassador
thidias
and
not
thyreus
as
the
editors
do
under
pretense
that
it
was
the
real
name
they
are
wrong
shakespeare
in
his
nomenclature
was
as
in
all
things
exquisite
for
certain
reasons
did
he
ever
do
anything
without
reason
he
chose
the
name
of
thidias
in
the
privacy
of
intimate
correspondence
furness
would
be
more
outspoken
being
not
restrained
by
the
thought
that
he
would
be
imposing
his
own
views
upon
the
mass
of
readers
on
cleopatra
about
whom
i
had
risked
opinions
somewhat
different
from
his
he
wrote
me
it
seems
it
was
yesterday
of
course
shakespeare
cleopatra
is
not
history
but
who
cares
for
history
of
this
be
assured
that
if
you
had
lived
with
her
as
i
have
for
two
years
you
would
adore
her
as
deeply
as
i
do
the
truth
is
that
as
he
said
he
actually
with
the
personages
of
the
plays
and
he
rapturously
listened
to
those
voices
which
came
clearer
to
his
infirm
ears
than
to
those
of
any
one
of
us
meant
only
for
commonplace
uses
he
had
a
better
right
than
any
to
form
an
opinion
but
was
ever
afraid
to
seem
to
force
it
on
others
of
his
edition
itself
he
had
written
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
this
is
an
edition
of
shakespeare
i
regard
it
rather
as
a
necessary
evil
on
another
occasion
having
been
criticised
about
a
certain
statement
of
his
he
wrote
i
now
wish
to
state
that
my
critic
was
entirely
right
and
i
entirely
wrong
his
work
was
a
work
of
love
but
it
was
also
a
work
of
reason
as
befits
a
philosopher
he
leaned
throughout
toward
conservative
methods
which
have
doubtless
the
fault
of
attracting
less
tumultuous
attention
to
the
worker
a
great
fault
in
the
eyes
of
the
many
a
great
quality
in
furness
own
his
shrewd
good
sense
seconded
by
a
no
less
enjoyable
good
humor
never
failed
him
when
he
began
one
important
question
had
first
to
be
decided
would
he
admit
in
his
work
only
textual
and
philological
criticisms
or
also
æsthetic
criticism
mere
poetry
sheer
literature
to
many
the
temptation
would
have
been
great
to
exclude
the
latter
the
fashion
being
among
the
most
haughty
if
not
the
most
learned
of
the
learned
to
doubt
the
seriousness
laboriousness
usefulness
of
any
who
can
enjoy
in
a
play
of
shakespeare
something
else
than
doubtful
readings
and
misprints
this
school
is
less
new
than
is
generally
believed
and
in
his
du
voltaire
had
already
represented
the
superb
critics
of
the
school
answering
those
who
asked
them
whether
they
would
not
visit
the
temple
nous
messieurs
point
du
tout
ce
pas
là
grâce
à
dieu
notre
étude
le
goût
rien
nous
avons
de
rédiger
au
long
de
point
en
point
ce
pensa
mais
nous
ne
pensons
point
the
fact
is
that
as
furness
well
perceived
from
the
first
the
two
elements
should
no
more
be
separated
than
soul
from
body
without
accuracy
literary
criticism
is
mere
trumpery
without
a
sense
of
the
beautiful
mere
accuracy
is
deathlike
much
æsthetic
criticism
wrote
furness
is
flat
stale
unprofitable
but
shall
we
ignore
the
possible
existence
of
a
keener
insight
than
our
own
are
we
not
to
listen
eagerly
and
reverently
when
coleridge
or
goethe
talks
about
shakespeare
with
such
a
rule
in
mind
he
made
his
selections
pruning
what
he
deemed
should
be
pruned
et
exclusiones
as
bacon
would
have
said
but
one
more
kind
of
thing
he
excluded
and
this
is
an
eminently
characteristic
trait
of
his
his
gentleness
not
a
weak
but
a
manly
one
rebelled
at
others
acerbity
and
when
he
saw
appear
that
unwelcome
and
somewhat
abundant
element
in
modern
criticism
he
simply
left
it
out
no
admittance
for
any
such
thing
within
the
covers
of
a
gentlemanly
and
scholarly
work
true
it
is
that
while
shakespeare
is
the
author
most
read
after
the
bible
it
is
also
the
one
about
which
the
most
furious
and
unchristian
disputes
have
been
waged
after
the
bible
the
philadelphia
scholar
wanted
all
the
critics
admitted
within
his
fold
to
keep
the
peace
there
and
he
adopted
the
following
rule
first
all
unfavorable
criticism
of
fellow
critics
is
excluded
as
much
as
possible
to
confound
goethe
schlegel
or
tieck
is
one
thing
to
elucidate
shakespeare
is
another
he
went
even
further
and
since
he
could
not
quote
whole
books
and
had
to
select
the
endeavor
he
said
in
all
honesty
has
been
to
select
from
every
author
the
passages
wherein
he
appears
to
best
advantage
what
critic
then
can
be
imagined
so
blind
to
the
service
rendered
so
much
in
love
with
his
own
harshness
that
would
not
feel
toward
furness
as
queen
katharine
toward
griffith
after
my
death
i
wish
no
other
herald
no
other
speaker
of
my
living
actions
to
keep
mine
honor
from
corruption
but
such
an
honest
chronicler
as
his
friendly
appreciation
of
french
critics
who
with
all
they
lacked
in
early
days
were
after
all
the
first
to
form
outside
of
england
an
opinion
on
shakespeare
the
oldest
one
being
of
about
can
not
but
touch
a
french
heart
it
has
given
me
especial
pleasure
he
said
in
the
introduction
to
his
first
volume
to
lay
before
the
english
reader
the
extracts
from
the
french
it
is
but
little
known
in
this
country
at
least
outside
the
ranks
of
shakespeare
students
how
great
is
the
influence
which
shakespeare
at
this
hour
is
exerting
on
french
literature
and
how
many
and
how
ardent
are
his
admirers
in
this
nation
he
had
even
at
a
later
date
a
good
word
for
poor
ducis
and
his
hamlet
a
hamlet
truly
ducis
own
nor
shall
i
ever
forget
in
what
tones
amidst
friendly
applause
the
great
scholar
spoke
of
france
in
his
own
city
of
philadelphia
at
the
memorable
gathering
of
april
when
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
the
nation
as
expressed
by
congress
a
medal
was
offered
to
my
country
to
commemorate
her
reception
of
franklin
at
the
hour
when
the
fate
of
the
states
was
still
weighing
in
the
balance
in
the
early
years
of
manhood
one
sees
far
ahead
on
the
road
those
great
thinkers
scientists
master
men
tall
powerful
visible
from
a
distance
ready
to
help
the
like
great
oaks
offering
their
shade
they
seem
so
strong
so
far
above
the
common
that
the
thought
never
occurs
that
we
of
the
frailer
sort
may
see
the
day
when
they
will
be
no
more
who
was
ever
present
at
the
death
of
an
oak
whoever
thought
that
he
could
see
the
day
when
he
would
accompany
robert
remains
to
westminster
or
mourn
for
the
disappearance
of
taine
or
gaston
paris
the
feeling
i
had
for
them
i
had
for
furness
too
was
it
possible
to
think
that
this
solid
oak
would
fall
he
himself
however
had
misgivings
and
it
seemed
of
late
years
as
if
the
dear
ones
who
had
gone
before
were
beckoning
to
him
do
you
remember
he
wrote
me
in
my
sister
wister
to
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
at
the
franklin
celebration
i
am
now
living
under
the
black
and
heavy
shadow
of
her
loss
she
left
me
last
november
solitary
and
alone
aching
for
the
of
a
voice
that
is
silent
and
at
a
more
recent
date
i
have
been
so
shattered
by
the
blows
of
fate
that
i
doubt
you
ever
again
receive
a
printed
from
me
and
now
in
our
turn
members
of
the
american
philosophical
society
members
of
the
shakespeare
societies
of
the
world
members
innumerable
of
the
republic
of
letters
we
too
ache
for
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
silent
on
the
signet
with
which
he
used
to
seal
his
letters
furness
had
engraved
a
motto
which
is
the
best
summing
up
of
emperor
marcus
aurelius
firm
and
resigned
philosophy
this
too
will
pass
away
for
him
too
the
august
sad
hour
struck
but
so
far
as
anything
in
this
fleeting
world
may
be
held
to
remain
so
long
as
mankind
shall
be
able
to
appreciate
honest
work
honestly
done
the
name
of
furness
will
not
pass
away
but
live
enshrined
in
every
scholar

from

to
peace
an
address
delivered
before
the
american
society
for
the
judicial
settlement
of
international
disputes
december
from
war
to
peace
does
peace
mean
progress
is
the
disappearance
of
war
a
sign
of
improvement
or
of
decay
at
a
yet
recent
date
learned
men
their
eyes
to
their
microscopes
were
teaching
us
that
among
the
various
kinds
of
living
creatures
they
had
studied
war
was
the
rule
that
where
struggle
ceased
life
ceased
and
that
since
more
beings
came
into
the
world
than
the
world
could
feed
the
destruction
of
the
weakest
was
both
a
necessity
and
a
condition
of
progress
struggle
war
violence
meant
development
peace
meant
decay
and
a
bold
generalization
applied
to
reasoning
man
the
fate
and
conditions
of
unreasoning
vermin
since
it
was
fate
why
resist
the
inevitable
and
what
could
be
the
good
of
peace
debates
but
the
that
science
had
placed
on
the
road
to
better
days
has
been
removed
by
science
herself
the
sweeping
conclusions
attributed
to
that
great
man
darwin
by
pupils
less
great
have
been
scrutinized
other
experiments
such
as
he
would
have
conducted
himself
had
he
been
living
were
tried
and
their
results
added
to
our
book
of
knowledge
great
results
indeed
and
notable
ones
it
turned
out
that
the
explanation
of
transformism
of
progress
of
survival
was
not
to
be
found
in
a
ceaseless
war
insuring
the
predominance
of
the
fittest
but
in
quiet
and
peaceful
adaptation
to
environment
to
climate
and
to
circumstances
and
we
french
are
excusably
proud
to
see
that
for
having
unfolded
those
truths
years
before
darwin
wrote
due
honor
is
now
rendered
almost
everywhere
and
especially
in
america
to
jean
baptiste
de
lamarck
author
of
the
long
obscure
and
now
famous
as
for
the
undue
multiplication
of
individuals
statistics
unknown
to
darwin
have
since
shown
that
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
beetles
or
fishes
and
let
them
work
out
their
own
problems
according
to
their
own
laws
there
is
for
man
at
least
no
need
of
to
ward
off
such
a
peril
the
general
decrease
of
the
rate
of
reproduction
so
striking
throughout
the
world
is
all
that
is
wanted
and
in
some
cases
is
even
more
than
is
wanted
war
therefore
is
not
our
unavoidable
fate
and
that
much
of
the
road
has
been
cleared
a
long
road
followed
amid
terrible
sufferings
by
mankind
through
centuries
the
chief
danger
in
times
past
and
partly
still
in
our
own
does
not
result
from
an
ineluctable
fate
but
from
the
private
disposition
of
men
and
of
their
leaders
and
we
know
what
for
ages
those
dispositions
were
chroniclers
are
wont
to
mention
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
king
went
to
the
wars
in
the
season
as
he
would
have
gone
people
at
large
saw
not
only
beauty
in
war
as
there
is
in
a
just
war
and
of
the
highest
order
exactly
as
there
is
in
every
duty
fulfilled
but
they
saw
in
it
an
unmixed
beauty
men
and
nations
would
take
pride
in
their
mercilessness
and
they
were
apt
to
find
in
the
sufferings
of
an
enemy
an
unalloyed
pleasure
such
were
the
feelings
of
the
time
to
none
of
the
master
artists
who
represented
the
day
of
judgment
on
the
walls
of
rome
orvieto
or
padua
or
on
the
portals
of
our
northern
cathedrals
did
the
thought
occur
to
place
among
his
fierce
angels
driving
the
guilty
to
their
doom
one
with
a
tear
on
his
face
a
tear
that
would
have
made
the
artist
more
famous
than
all
his
art
a
tear
not
because
the
tortures
could
be
supposed
to
be
unjust
or
the
men
sinless
but
because
they
were
tortures
and
because
the
men
had
been
sinful
iræ
artists
belonged
to
their
time
and
expressed
their
time
thought
the
teaching
of
saints
and
of
thinkers
long
remained
of
little
avail
war
that
human
malady
as
montaigne
said
was
considered
as
impossible
to
heal
as
rabies
was
until
the
day
when
a
pasteur
came
yet
protests
began
to
be
more
perceptibly
heard
as
men
better
understood
what
they
themselves
were
and
commenced
to
suspect
that
the
time
might
come
when
all
would
be
equal
before
the
law
nothing
tocqueville
has
observed
is
so
conducive
to
mercy
as
equality
all
those
who
in
the
course
of
centuries
led
men
to
the
conquest
of
their
rights
can
be
truly
claimed
as
the
intellectual
ancestors
of
the
present
promoters
of
a
sane
international
peace
men
like
our
jean
bodin
who
while
upholding
as
was
unavoidable
in
his
day
the
principle
of
autocracy
yet
based
his
study
of
the
government
of
nations
on
the
general
interests
of
the
commonwealth
and
who
in
opposition
to
machiavelli
who
had
called
his
book
called
his
to
bodin
who
protests
against
the
right
of
the
strongest
have
been
traced
some
of
the
principles
embodied
much
later
in
the
american
and
in
the
french
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
such
thinkers
truly
deserve
the
name
of
forerunners
such
men
as
that
great
hugo
grotius
whose
fame
was
not
without
influence
on
the
selection
of
his
own
country
as
the
seat
of
the
peace
conferences
of
our
day
and
who
being
then
settled
in
france
near
senlis
dedicated
to
king
louis
xiii
his
famous
work
on
war
and
peace
so
memorable
for
its
denunciation
of
frivolous
wars
and
wanton
cruelties
soon
the
names
of
those
to
be
honored
for
the
same
cause
became
legion
men
like
pascal
the
encyclopedists
kant
bentham
tocqueville
and
many
others
among
pascal
is
this
memorable
one
which
forecasts
and
sums
up
much
of
what
has
since
been
or
will
be
done
when
it
is
a
question
of
deciding
whether
war
should
be
waged
of
sentencing
so
many
spaniards
to
death
one
man
only
decides
and
one
who
is
interested
the
decision
ought
to
rest
with
an
impartial
third
party
a
little
later
that
strange
abbé
de
was
writing
those
works
considered
as
so
many
wild
dreams
in
his
day
and
no
longer
read
at
all
in
ours
but
if
he
were
to
return
now
he
would
according
to
one
of
his
latest
critics
feel
not
at
all
dismayed
but
say
this
is
all
for
the
best
you
need
not
study
my
works
since
you
have
put
in
practise
nearly
all
my
ideas
there
remains
only
my
but
like
the
others
its
turn
will
come
if
its
turn
has
not
come
yet
great
practical
steps
have
surely
been
taken
toward
it
chief
among
them
that
move
so
unexpected
a
few
years
ago
so
dubiously
wondered
at
when
it
occurred
and
now
so
thoroughly
accepted
that
as
in
the
case
of
all
great
inventions
one
wonders
how
things
could
go
on
before
it
existed
the
calling
of
the
first
conference
at
the
hague
by
the
emperor
of
russia
nicholas
ii
the
maintenance
of
general
peace
read
the
russian
circular
of
august
and
a
possible
reduction
of
the
excessive
armaments
which
weigh
upon
all
nations
present
themselves
in
the
actual
situation
of
the
world
as
the
ideal
toward
which
should
tend
the
efforts
of
all
governments
the
financial
expense
touches
public
prosperity
at
its
very
source
the
intellectual
and
physical
powers
of
peoples
labor
and
capital
are
most
of
it
turned
aside
from
their
natural
functions
and
consumed
unproductively
to
put
an
end
to
those
ceaseless
armaments
and
to
find
means
for
preventing
the
calamities
which
threaten
the
entire
world
such
is
the
supreme
duty
which
lies
upon
all
states
when
one
man
then
another
then
another
had
come
and
said
i
can
draw
the
lightning
from
the
clouds
i
can
rise
in
the
air
i
can
flash
your
words
and
thoughts
to
any
distance
you
please
i
can
cure
rabies
by
inoculating
rabies
i
can
make
you
talk
with
your
friend
miles
away
i
can
navigate
a
boat
under
the
sea
scepticism
had
scarcely
been
greater
than
when
the
circular
took
the
world
by
surprise
the
issue
seemed
more
than
doubtful
many
among
the
most
sanguine
barely
hoped
to
succeed
in
preventing
the
absolute
failure
that
would
have
killed
such
a
project
for
generations
shortly
afterward
i
happened
to
be
in
petersburg
and
had
the
honor
of
being
received
by
the
emperor
the
conversation
fell
on
the
great
design
to
give
it
the
name
used
for
the
very
different
plan
implying
coercion
attributed
two
centuries
before
to
the
french
king
henry
iv
i
was
struck
by
the
quiet
conviction
of
the
originator
of
the
new
movement
as
to
its
ultimate
results
and
his
disposition
not
to
give
up
the
plan
if
at
first
it
met
with
difficulties
and
delays
emperor
nicholas
summed
up
his
views
with
the
remark
one
must
wait
longer
when
planting
an
oak
than
when
planting
a
flower
longer
indeed
yet
not
so
very
long
after
all
the
first
conference
took
place
and
in
it
i
may
say
the
delegations
of
our
two
republics
presided
over
by
such
statesmen
and
thinkers
as
andrew
white
and
léon
bourgeois
failed
not
to
fulfill
the
part
assigned
to
our
democracies
by
their
ideals
and
traditions
in
spite
of
scepticism
that
first
conference
reached
an
unexpected
measure
of
success
eight
years
later
a
second
one
was
convened
on
the
felicitous
suggestion
of
president
roosevelt
and
now
the
supposedly
useless
mechanism
from
dreamland
has
been
so
heartily
accepted
by
mankind
at
large
all
over
the
globe
that
the
approximate
date
for
a
third
one
has
already
been
selected
governments
at
first
doubted
that
one
would
be
of
any
use
now
they
want
more
the
word
had
been
spoken
indeed
at
the
proper
moment
the
teachings
of
philosophers
and
of
experience
the
outcome
of
revolutions
a
more
vivid
sense
of
equality
among
men
imbuing
them
with
mercy
according
to
tocqueville
had
caused
the
seed
to
fall
on
prepared
ground
we
scarcely
realize
looking
at
it
from
so
near
how
great
the
movement
thus
started
has
already
become
the
practical
ideas
put
forth
less
than
a
dozen
years
ago
have
progressed
so
much
that
more
treaties
of
arbitration
have
been
signed
between
the
first
hague
conference
and
now
than
between
the
day
of
creation
and
that
conference
i
take
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
allude
to
my
own
feelings
no
small
pride
in
having
concluded
the
first
one
duly
ratified
by
both
countries
ever
signed
by
the
united
states
with
any
european
power
and
i
was
glad
to
thus
continue
an
tradition
since
in
the
matter
of
treaties
with
the
united
states
be
they
treaties
of
commerce
alliance
or
amity
france
has
been
accustomed
to
take
the
lead
among
nations
quicker
indeed
than
was
anticipated
by
the
sower
himself
the
oak
has
grown
and
the
nations
can
rest
under
its
shade
several
important
appeals
have
been
made
to
the
court
of
the
hague
the
united
states
taking
the
lead
and
giving
to
all
the
best
example
those
experiments
which
most
of
the
great
powers
have
already
tried
have
had
manifold
advantages
they
have
shown
that
dangerous
quarrels
thus
be
honorably
settled
they
have
shown
also
that
defects
in
the
working
of
the
court
exist
and
should
be
remedied
public
utterances
and
circulars
from
presidents
roosevelt
and
taft
and
from
secretaries
of
state
root
and
knox
have
pointed
out
the
importance
of
trying
to
establish
a
permanent
court
with
judges
ever
present
paid
by
the
associated
nations
selected
from
among
men
of
such
a
high
moral
standing
as
to
be
above
influence
of
creed
or
nationality
true
citizens
of
the
world
fit
magistrates
to
judge
the
world
in
these
views
the
future
realization
of
which
the
second
conference
has
insured
france
heartily
concurred
having
indeed
during
the
first
conference
initiated
an
early
preliminary
move
toward
continuity
and
permanence
given
these
more
and
more
enlightened
dispositions
among
governments
it
may
seem
that
the
work
of
a
private
society
like
this
must
needs
be
of
comparatively
little
import
the
reverse
is
the
truth
it
has
an
immense
power
for
good
for
it
can
act
directly
on
the
lever
that
moves
the
world
public
opinion
so
powerful
is
such
a
lever
that
even
in
the
past
in
times
when
men
were
not
their
own
masters
public
opinion
had
to
be
reckoned
with
such
imperious
leaders
of
men
as
a
richelieu
or
a
napoleon
knew
it
better
than
any
one
veritate
had
even
cynically
said
the
great
philosopher
francis
bacon
but
if
opinion
can
occasionally
defeat
truth
much
better
can
it
defend
truth
with
the
spreading
of
instruction
and
with
an
easier
access
to
men
minds
through
books
journals
public
meetings
and
free
discussion
its
power
against
truth
has
been
considerably
diminished
and
its
power
for
good
increased
and
purified
you
know
this
and
act
accordingly
though
doing
so
in
your
private
capacity
you
conform
in
fact
to
the
instructions
drawn
by
a
masterly
hand
for
the
american
delegates
at
the
second
conference
at
the
hague
in
these
instructions
secretary
root
told
the
delegates
never
to
forget
that
the
object
of
the
conference
was
agreement
not
compulsion
and
that
the
agreements
reached
should
be
genuine
and
not
reluctant
this
is
undoubtedly
the
road
to
follow
a
road
not
yet
smooth
nor
cleared
of
its
rocks
and
pitfalls
the
dangers
continue
to
be
many
one
of
the
dangers
is
of
asking
too
much
too
soon
and
of
causing
nations
to
fear
that
if
they
make
any
little
concession
they
will
be
led
by
degrees
to
a
point
where
being
peacefully
disarmed
their
continuance
as
a
nation
will
depend
upon
the
will
the
good
faith
and
the
excellent
virtues
of
some
one
else
another
is
to
describe
war
as
being
such
an
abominable
thing
in
itself
whatever
be
its
occasion
as
to
cause
that
public
opinion
on
which
so
much
depends
to
rebel
against
the
preacher
and
his
whole
doctrine
let
us
not
forget
that
even
in
the
land
of
utopia
the
country
of
nowhere
in
which
every
virtue
of
good
citizenship
was
practised
and
war
held
as
a
monstrosity
plane
all
wars
had
not
been
abolished
sir
thomas
more
informs
us
that
utopians
make
war
for
two
causes
and
keep
therefore
well
drilled
the
causes
are
first
to
defend
their
own
country
second
to
drive
out
of
their
friends
land
the
enemies
that
have
invaded
it
we
have
waged
in
the
past
such
wars
and
can
not
pretend
to
feel
repentant
such
wars
continue
to
be
unavoidable
and
to
deny
this
is
only
to
increase
the
danger
of
a
revulsion
of
feeling
among
nations
what
we
may
hope
and
must
strive
for
is
that
with
the
development
of
mankind
a
better
knowledge
of
our
neighbors
an
understanding
that
a
difference
is
not
necessarily
a
vice
nor
a
criticism
a
threat
with
that
better
instruction
which
a
society
like
this
one
is
giving
to
the
many
a
time
may
come
when
that
same
public
opinion
will
render
impossible
the
two
sorts
of
for
which
more
deems
war
to
be
not
only
necessary
but
noble
and
virtuous
no
less
dangerous
is
it
to
load
war
with
all
the
sins
in
israel
thus
running
the
same
risk
of
making
people
rebel
not
only
against
the
preacher
but
against
his
very
creed
when
we
are
told
by
the
pacifist
that
owing
to
the
wars
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
only
inferior
people
were
left
in
france
to
perpetuate
the
race
we
wonder
how
it
is
that
she
got
a
victor
hugo
an
alexandre
dumas
a
louis
pasteur
sons
of
soldiers
of
napoleon
all
three
we
wonder
how
in
spite
of
this
supposed
survival
of
the
weakest
that
country
got
so
many
thinkers
philosophers
poets
artists
soldiers
explorers
how
the
venturous
spirit
of
the
former
coureurs
de
bois
awoke
again
in
our
days
with
such
notable
results
in
asia
africa
and
elsewhere
how
birth
was
given
in
our
land
to
the
inventors
of
the
dirigible
the
automobile
the
submarine
photography
and
radium
how
the
love
of
sport
in
the
race
has
reappeared
of
late
as
active
as
it
had
ever
been
in
the
remote
times
when
football
and
cricket
found
in
france
their
cradle
exaggeration
will
not
help
but
on
the
contrary
surely
hurt
truth
if
we
follow
her
is
certain
to
lead
to
better
times
she
has
already
wars
in
former
centuries
lasted
a
hundred
years
then
they
lasted
thirty
years
then
seven
years
and
now
as
disastrous
as
ever
it
is
true
but
separated
by
longer
intervals
they
last
one
year
you
are
about
to
celebrate
a
hundred
years
peace
with
england
so
are
we
that
move
toward
truer
longer
perhaps
one
day
definitive
peace
has
been
prophesied
long
before
our
time
not
merely
by
a
dreamer
like
abbé
de
but
by
one
who
had
a
rare
experience
of
men
of
war
and
of
peace
and
who
considering
especially
the
influence
of
trade
on
nations
once
said
although
i
pretend
to
no
peculiar
information
respecting
commercial
affairs
nor
any
foresight
into
the
scenes
of
futurity
yet
as
the
member
of
an
infant
empire
as
a
philanthropist
by
character
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
as
a
citizen
of
the
great
republic
of
humanity
at
large
i
can
not
help
turning
my
attention
sometimes
to
this
subject
i
would
be
understood
to
mean
that
i
can
not
help
reflecting
with
pleasure
on
the
probable
influence
that
commerce
may
hereafter
have
on
human
manners
and
society
in
general
on
these
occasions
i
consider
how
mankind
may
be
connected
like
one
great
family
in
fraternal
ties
i
indulge
a
fond
perhaps
an
enthusiastic
idea
that
as
the
world
is
evidently
less
barbarous
than
it
has
been
its
amelioration
must
still
be
progressive
that
nations
are
becoming
more
humanized
in
their
policy
that
the
subjects
of
ambition
and
causes
for
hostility
are
daily
diminishing
and
in
fine
that
the
period
is
not
very
remote
when
the
benefits
of
a
liberal
and
free
commerce
will
pretty
generally
succeed
to
the
devastations
and
horrors
of
war
thus
wrote
to
lafayette
on
the
of
august
that
citizen
of
the
great
republic
of
humanity
george
washington
that
practical
results
have
been
secured
is
certain
that
better
ones
are
in
store
if
we
act
wisely
is
no
less
certain
mankind
longs
for
less
troubled
days
and
moves
toward
this
not
inaccessible
goal
such
is
the
truth
and
we
may
feel
confident
that
according
to
the
word
of
dying
wyclif
truth
shall
conquer
a
postscript
a
few
years
after
this
address
had
been
delivered
threatening
clouds
began
to
gather
germany
who
had
prevented
at
the
first
conference
of
the
hague
anything
being
done
toward
a
limitation
of
armaments
as
proposed
by
russia
suddenly
in
full
peace
when
other
nations
were
inclined
to
think
that
they
were
rather
too
much
armed
than
not
enough
passed
a
law
increasing
in
a
prodigious
degree
her
military
forces
on
this
move
of
hers
on
what
democracies
ought
to
do
in
the
presence
of
such
an
unexpected
event
on
the
future
of
the
peace
and
arbitration
ideas
after
such
a
blow
the
former
president
of
the
french
delegation
at
the
hague
léon
bourgeois
wrote
in
may
little
more
than
a
year
before
the
present
war
a
noteworthy
letter
in
which
we
read
one
fact
strikes
us
most
painfully
and
might
at
first
disturb
our
minds
the
bills
presently
submitted
to
the
reichstag
are
going
to
increase
in
a
formidable
manner
the
armaments
of
germany
and
to
necessitate
on
the
part
of
france
an
extraordinary
effort
and
sacrifices
to
which
we
must
manfully
and
promptly
consent
no
one
more
than
myself
deplores
that
folly
of
armaments
to
which
europe
is
yielding
and
i
do
not
forget
that
it
was
i
who
in
at
the
first
hague
conference
drew
up
and
defended
the
resolution
in
favor
of
a
limitation
of
the
military
load
weighing
on
the
world
but
i
do
not
forget
either
what
i
said
before
the
senate
in
after
the
second
conference
for
us
confirmed
partisans
of
arbitration
and
peace
is
a
consequence
not
a
for
disarmament
to
be
possible
one
must
first
feel
that
one
right
is
secure
the
security
of
right
is
what
must
be
organized
first
of
all
behind
that
rampart
alone
nations
will
be
able
to
lay
down
their
arms
let
us
be
pacific
but
let
us
be
strong
and
let
us
know
how
to
wait
the
very
excess
of
the
load
weighing
on
europe
will
originate
sooner
than
is
sometimes
believed
that
irresistible
movement
of
opinion
which
will
cause
a
policy
of
wisdom
mutual
respect
and
real
security
to
become
an
unavoidable
necessity
the
chief
factor
will
be
public
opinion
present
events
will
one
may
hope
have
served
to
educate
public
opinion

since

the

a
