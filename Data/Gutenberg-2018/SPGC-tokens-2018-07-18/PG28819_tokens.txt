i
the
fascinating
maggie
cicely
cardew
and
her
sister
merry
were
twins
at
the
time
when
this
story
opens
they
were
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
of
age
they
were
bright
amiable
pretty
young
girls
who
had
never
wanted
for
any
pleasure
or
luxury
during
their
lives
their
home
was
a
happy
one
their
parents
were
affectionate
and
lived
solely
for
them
they
were
the
only
children
and
were
treated
as
only
children
often
are
with
a
considerable
amount
of
attention
they
were
surrounded
by
all
the
appliances
of
wealth
they
had
ponies
to
ride
and
carriages
to
drive
in
and
each
had
her
own
luxurious
and
beautifully
furnished
bedroom
it
was
cardew
wish
that
his
daughters
should
be
educated
at
home
in
consequence
they
were
not
sent
to
any
school
but
had
daily
masters
and
governesses
to
instruct
them
in
the
usual
curriculum
of
knowledge
it
might
be
truly
said
that
for
them
the
sun
always
shone
and
that
they
were
carefully
guarded
from
the
east
wind
they
were
naturally
bright
and
amiable
they
had
their
share
of
good
looks
without
being
quite
beautiful
they
had
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
what
the
world
meant
of
what
sorrow
meant
or
pain
they
were
brought
up
in
such
a
sheltered
way
that
it
seemed
to
them
that
there
were
no
storms
in
life
they
were
not
discontented
for
no
one
ever
breathed
the
word
in
their
presence
their
requests
were
reasonable
for
they
knew
of
no
very
big
things
to
ask
for
even
their
books
were
carefully
selected
for
them
and
their
amusements
were
of
a
mild
and
orderly
character
such
were
the
girls
when
this
story
opens
on
a
bright
day
towards
the
end
of
a
certain
july
their
home
was
called
meredith
manor
and
merry
was
called
after
an
old
ancestor
on
their
mother
side
to
whom
the
house
had
at
one
time
belonged
cardew
was
a
cardew
belonged
to
an
old
county
family
if
there
was
one
thing
in
the
world
that
cicely
and
merry
thought
nothing
whatever
about
it
was
money
they
could
understand
neither
poverty
nor
the
absence
of
gold
the
little
village
near
meredith
manor
was
a
model
place
for
cardew
to
whom
it
belonged
devoted
himself
absolutely
to
it
the
houses
were
well
drained
and
taken
great
care
of
prizes
were
offered
for
the
best
gardens
consequently
each
cottager
vied
with
the
other
in
producing
the
most
lovely
flowers
and
the
most
tempting
fruits
the
village
consisted
entirely
of
cardew
laborers
and
the
different
servants
on
his
estate
there
were
therefore
no
hardships
for
the
girls
to
witness
at
meredith
village
they
were
fond
of
popping
in
and
out
of
the
cottages
and
talking
to
the
young
wives
and
mothers
and
playing
with
the
babies
and
they
particularly
enjoyed
that
great
annual
day
when
cardew
threw
open
the
grounds
of
meredith
to
the
entire
neighborhood
and
when
games
and
fun
and
all
sorts
of
amusements
were
the
order
of
the
hour
besides
the
people
who
lived
in
the
village
there
was
of
course
the
rector
who
had
a
pretty
picturesque
old
brown
house
with
a
nice
garden
in
one
corner
of
the
grounds
he
had
a
happy
wife
and
a
family
of
four
stalwart
sons
and
daughters
he
was
known
as
the
reverend
william
tristram
and
as
the
living
was
in
the
gift
of
the
meredith
family
he
was
a
distant
connection
of
cardew
and
had
been
appointed
by
her
husband
to
the
living
of
meredith
at
her
request
the
only
playfellows
the
girls
had
ever
enjoyed
were
the
young
tristrams
there
were
two
boys
and
two
girls
the
boys
were
the
younger
the
girls
the
elder
the
boys
were
not
yet
in
their
teens
but
molly
and
isabel
tristram
were
about
the
same
age
as
the
young
cardews
molly
was
in
fact
a
year
older
and
was
a
very
sympathetic
determined
girl
she
and
her
sister
isabel
had
not
been
educated
at
home
but
had
been
sent
to
foreign
schools
both
in
france
and
germany
and
molly
in
her
heart
of
hearts
rather
looked
down
upon
what
she
considered
the
meager
attainments
of
the
young
cardews
and
their
want
of
knowledge
of
the
world
it
is
ridiculous
she
was
heard
to
say
to
isabel
on
that
very
july
morning
when
this
story
opens
of
course
they
are
nice
girls
and
would
be
splendid
if
they
could
do
anything
or
knew
what
to
do
but
as
it
is
they
are
nothing
whatever
but
children
with
no
more
idea
of
the
world
than
has
that
disporting
itself
at
the
present
moment
on
the
lawn
oh
they
right
enough
said
isabel
they
will
learn
i
do
suppose
and
cardew
mean
to
keep
them
always
shut
up
in
a
nutshell
i
do
know
replied
molly
and
cardew
are
like
no
other
people
i
have
heard
father
say
that
he
thinks
it
a
great
pity
that
girls
should
be
so
terribly
isolated
well
as
to
that
replied
isabel
i
would
be
in
their
shoes
for
creation
i
have
so
enjoyed
my
time
at
hanover
and
in
france
and
now
that
we
are
to
have
two
years
at
aylmer
house
in
kensington
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
look
forward
to
it
yes
wo
it
be
fine
replied
molly
but
now
we
had
better
go
up
at
once
to
meredith
manor
and
ask
the
girls
if
we
may
bring
maggie
howland
with
us
this
afternoon
father
has
sent
the
to
the
station
to
meet
her
and
she
may
arrive
any
moment
all
right
said
isabel
but
one
of
us
had
better
stay
at
home
to
receive
her
you
molly
can
run
up
to
the
manor
and
ask
the
girls
if
we
may
bring
our
visitor
all
right
replied
molly
then
she
added
i
wonder
if
maggie
is
as
fascinating
as
ever
do
you
remember
belle
what
a
spell
she
cast
over
us
at
our
school
at
hanover
she
was
like
no
one
else
i
ever
met
she
seems
to
do
what
she
likes
with
people
i
shall
be
deeply
interested
to
know
what
she
thinks
of
cicely
and
merry
thinks
of
them
replied
isabel
it
my
opinion
she
wo
tolerate
them
for
a
minute
and
we
are
bound
to
take
her
with
us
for
of
course
they
will
give
permission
well
said
molly
i
be
off
at
once
and
secure
that
permission
you
look
after
maggie
wo
you
isabel
and
see
that
her
bedroom
is
all
right
as
molly
spoke
she
waved
her
hand
to
her
sister
then
departed
on
her
errand
she
was
a
bright
fairly
girl
with
exceedingly
handsome
eyes
and
curling
hair
she
was
somewhat
square
in
build
and
athletic
in
all
her
movements
in
short
she
was
as
great
a
contrast
to
the
twin
cardew
girls
as
could
be
found
nevertheless
she
liked
them
and
was
interested
in
them
for
were
not
the
cardews
the
great
people
of
the
place
there
was
nothing
of
the
snob
about
molly
but
it
is
difficult
even
for
the
most
independent
english
girl
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
her
life
in
a
village
where
one
family
reigns
as
sovereign
without
being
more
or
less
under
its
influence
tristram
too
was
a
very
great
friend
of
cardew
and
molly
fat
round
mother
although
a
little
afraid
of
cardew
who
was
a
very
stately
lady
in
her
way
nevertheless
held
her
in
the
greatest
respect
and
admiration
it
was
one
of
the
rules
of
the
house
of
tristram
that
no
invitation
sent
to
them
from
meredith
manor
should
be
refused
they
must
accept
that
invitation
as
though
it
were
the
command
of
a
king
the
girls
brought
up
mostly
at
foreign
schools
had
in
some
ways
wider
ideas
of
life
than
had
their
parents
but
even
they
were
more
or
less
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
cardews
were
the
great
people
of
the
place
the
day
was
a
very
hot
one
rather
oppressive
too
with
in
the
distance
but
molly
was
very
strong
and
did
not
feel
the
heat
in
the
least
the
distance
from
the
rectory
to
the
manor
was
a
little
over
a
mile
in
addition
it
was
all
uphill
but
when
you
passed
the
village
so
exquisitely
neat
such
a
model
in
its
way
you
found
yourself
entering
a
road
shaded
by
overhanging
here
it
was
cool
even
on
the
hottest
summer
day
there
were
deep
at
each
side
of
the
road
and
the
road
itself
had
been
cut
right
through
a
part
of
the
forest
which
belonged
to
the
meredith
estate
after
going
uphill
for
nearly
of
a
mile
you
arrived
at
the
handsome
gates
which
led
to
the
avenue
that
brought
you
to
the
great
front
door
of
meredith
manor
molly
often
took
this
walk
but
she
generally
did
so
in
the
company
of
her
sister
isabel
isabel
light
chatter
her
gay
infectious
laughter
her
merry
manner
soothed
the
tedium
of
the
road
molly
was
alone
but
by
no
means
on
this
account
did
she
feel
a
sense
of
weariness
her
mind
was
very
busy
she
was
greatly
excited
at
the
thought
of
seeing
maggie
howland
again
maggie
had
made
a
remarkable
impression
on
her
she
made
that
impression
on
all
her
friends
wherever
she
went
she
was
a
leader
and
no
one
could
quite
discover
where
her
special
charm
or
magnetism
lay
for
she
was
decidedly
plain
and
not
specially
remarkable
for
cleverness
that
is
she
was
not
remarkable
for
what
may
be
termed
she
was
indifferent
to
prizes
and
was
just
as
happy
at
the
bottom
of
her
form
as
at
the
top
but
wherever
she
appeared
girls
clustered
round
her
and
consulted
her
and
hung
on
her
words
and
to
be
maggie
friend
was
considered
the
greatest
honor
possible
among
the
girls
themselves
at
any
school
where
she
spent
her
time
maggie
was
the
daughter
of
a
widow
who
lived
in
london
her
father
had
died
when
she
was
a
very
little
girl
he
was
a
man
of
remarkable
character
he
had
great
strength
of
will
and
immense
determination
and
maggie
his
only
child
took
after
him
she
resembled
him
in
appearance
also
for
he
was
very
plain
of
face
and
rather
ungainly
of
figure
maggie
mother
on
the
other
hand
was
a
delicate
pretty
woman
who
could
as
little
manage
her
headstrong
young
daughter
as
a
lamb
could
manage
a
young
lion
howland
was
intensely
amiable
maggie
was
very
good
to
her
mother
as
she
expressed
it
and
when
she
got
that
same
mother
to
yield
to
all
her
wishes
the
mother
thought
that
she
was
doing
the
right
thing
she
had
a
passionate
love
for
her
daughter
although
she
deplored
her
plain
looks
and
often
told
the
girl
to
her
face
that
she
wished
she
had
taken
after
her
in
personal
appearance
maggie
used
to
smile
when
this
was
said
and
then
would
go
away
to
her
own
room
and
look
at
her
queer
dark
face
and
rather
small
eyes
and
determined
mouth
and
somewhat
heavy
jaw
and
shake
her
head
solemnly
she
did
not
agree
with
her
mother
she
preferred
being
what
she
was
she
liked
best
to
take
after
her
father
it
was
maggie
howland
who
had
persuaded
tristram
during
a
brief
visit
which
he
had
made
to
town
at
christmas
to
send
his
daughters
to
aylmer
house
maggie
was
fond
of
molly
and
isabel
with
all
her
oddities
she
had
real
affection
and
one
of
her
good
qualities
was
that
she
really
loved
those
whom
she
influenced
tristram
went
to
see
ward
the
of
that
most
select
establishment
for
young
ladies
at
kensington
ward
was
all
that
was
delightful
she
was
a
woman
of
high
aspirations
and
her
twenty
young
boarders
were
happy
and
bright
and
contented
under
her
influence
maggie
joined
the
school
at
easter
and
spent
one
term
there
and
was
now
coming
on
a
visit
to
the
rectory
i
wonder
what
she
will
have
to
tell
us
i
wonder
if
she
is
as
fascinating
as
ever
thought
molly
tristram
as
she
hurried
her
steps
she
had
now
reached
that
point
in
the
avenue
which
gave
a
good
view
of
the
old
manor
with
its
castellated
walls
and
its
square
towers
at
each
end
the
gardens
were
laid
out
in
terraces
after
an
fashion
there
was
one
terrace
devoted
to
croquet
another
to
tennis
as
molly
approached
she
saw
cicely
and
merry
playing
a
game
of
croquet
rather
languidly
they
wore
simple
white
frocks
which
just
came
down
above
their
ankles
and
had
white
on
their
heads
their
thick
rather
fair
hair
was
worn
in
a
plait
down
each
young
back
and
was
tied
with
a
bunch
of
ribbon
at
the
end
hello
shouted
molly
the
girls
flung
down
their
rackets
and
ran
joyfully
to
meet
her
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
said
cicely
it
much
too
hot
to
play
tennis
and
even
croquet
is
more
than
we
can
manage
are
you
going
to
stay
and
have
lunch
with
us
molly
no
replied
molly
i
must
go
back
immediately
oh
dear
i
wish
you
would
stay
continued
merry
we
could
go
and
sit
in
the
arbor
and
you
could
tell
us
another
fascinating
story
about
that
school
of
yours
at
hanover
yes

cicely

molly
we

a
but

excited

said
molly
who
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
giving
her
friends
a
piece
of
information
which
she
knew
would
interest
them
intensely
you

you
are
our
darling
dear
friends
our
only
friends
said
cicely
you
are
the
only
girls
in
the
world
father
allows
us
to
be
the
least
bit
intimate
with
oh
well
said
molly
of
course
belle
and
i
are
very
fond
of
you
both
naturally
naturally
echoed
cicely
but
then
she
added
how
queer
you
look
molly
as
though
you
were
keeping
something
back
well
yes
i
am
said
molly
but
i
have
it
out
in
a
minute
oh
please
be
quick
said
merry
anything
a
little
bit
out
of
the
common
is
very
is
it
cicely
very
said
cicely
more
particularly
in
the
holidays
when
we
are
busy
with
our
lessons
things
do
so
much
matter
you
but
do
be
quick
molly
what
is
it
well
said
molly
you
asked
us
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
you
of
course
and
you
both
coming
surely
we
are
certainly
we
are
that
is
if
you
will
allow
us
to
bring
to
bring
interrupted
cicely
oh
molly
do
speak
well
i
will
only
do
jump
you
two
girls
to
bring
maggie
howland
cicely
face
grew
very
pink
merry
on
the
contrary
turned
a
little
pale
they
were
both
silent
for
a
brief
space
then
merry
said
excitedly
maggie
howland
maggie
howland
yes
maggie
howland
the
one
who
has
got
the
power
the
charm
the
fascination
oh
oh
said
cicely
but
why
is
she
with
you
how
has
it
happened
she
is
not
absolutely
with
us
yet
and
as
to
how
it
happened
i
can
not
exactly
tell
you
we
had
a
telegram
from
her
late
last
night
asking
if
she
might
come
to
spend
a
week
or
fortnight
and
of
course
we
wired
back
we
are
delighted
but
of
course
you
may
not
like
her
girls
like
her
like
her
said
cicely
and
after
all
you
have
said
too
we
shall
be
certain
to
more
than
like
her
she
not
a
bit
pretty
so
do
expect
it
said
molly
we
were
brought
up
said
merry
a
little
stiffly
not
to
regard
looks
as
anything
at
all
nonsense
replied
molly
looks
mean
a
great
deal
i
give
i
know
what
to
be
beautiful
but
as
i
am
not
i
do
mean
to
fret
about
it
well
maggie
downright
plain
in
fact
in
fact
almost
ugly
i
may
say
and
yet
and
yet
she
is
just
maggie
and
you
are
not
five
minutes
in
her
society
before
you
rather
have
her
face
than
any
other
face
in
the
world
but
the
immediate
question
is
may
she
come
this
afternoon
or
may
she
not
of
course
of
course
she
may
come
said
cicely
we
be
delighted
we
be
charmed
to
see
her
this
pleasant
news
i
think
perhaps
said
merry
we
ought
to
go
and
ask
mother
you
think
so
cis
of
course
we
ought
said
cicely
i
forgot
that
just
stay
where
you
are
molly
and
i
run
to
the
house
and
find
mother
it
only
to
ask
her
for
of
course
she
will
give
leave
cicely
ran
off
at
once
and
merry
and
molly
were
left
alone
i
know
you
be
delighted
with
her
said
molly
it
will
be
very
delightful
to
see
her
replied
merry
you
must
expect
to
be
disappointed
at
first
all
the
same
continued
molly
oh
looks
do
not
matter
one
scrap
said
merry
isabel
and
i
are
going
to
her
school
you
know
that
do
you
merry
yes
said
merry
with
a
sigh
what
fun
you
do
have
at
your
different
schools
do
you
molly
well
yes
said
molly
rather
gravely
but
it
is
only
the
fun
we
see
a
lot
of
the
world
and
we
mix
with
other
girls
and
make
friends
mother
prefers
a
home
education
for
us
and
so
does
father
remarked
merry
ah
here
comes
cicely
she
is
flying
down
the
terrace
of
course
mother
is
delighted
this
proved
to
be
the
case
cardew
would
welcome
any
girl
introduced
to
her
daughters
through
her
dear
friend
tristram
she
sent
a
further
invitation
for
the
three
young
people
to
remain
to
an
impromptu
supper
which
was
pleasanter
than
late
dinner
in
such
hot
weather
and
asked
if
and
tristram
would
join
them
at
the
meal
hurrah
cried
molly
that
will
be
fun
i
must
be
off
now
girls
we
be
with
you
all
three
of
us
between
four
and
five
chapter
ii
isabel
took
great
pains
arranging
maggie
rowland
bedroom
at
the
castle
or
manor
there
were
always
troops
of
servants
for
every
imaginable
thing
but
at
the
rectory
the
servants
were
few
and
the
girls
did
a
good
many
odds
and
ends
of
work
themselves
they
were
expected
to
dust
and
keep
in
perfect
order
their
exceedingly
pretty
bedrooms
they
were
further
required
to
make
their
own
beds
and
if
a
young
visitor
arrived
they
were
obliged
to
wait
on
her
and
see
to
her
comfort
for
the
tristrams
had
just
an
income
sufficient
to
cover
their
expenses
with
nothing
at
all
to
put
by
tristram
had
his
two
little
boys
to
think
of
as
well
as
his
two
girls
his
intention
was
to
give
his
children
the
best
education
possible
believing
that
such
a
gift
was
far
more
valuable
to
them
than
mere
money
when
they
were
old
enough
the
girls
might
earn
their
own
living
if
they
felt
so
inclined
and
each
girl
might
become
a
specialist
in
her
way
molly
was
exceedingly
fond
of
music
and
wished
to
excel
in
that
particular
isabel
on
the
contrary
was
anxious
to
obtain
a
post
as
gymnasium
teacher
with
the
london
county
council
but
all
these
things
were
for
the
future
at
present
the
girls
were
to
study
were
to
acquire
knowledge
were
to
be
prepared
for
that
battle
which
includes
body
soul
and
spirit
and
which
needs
triple
armor
in
the
fight
tristram
was
a
man
of
high
religious
principles
he
taught
his
children
to
love
the
good
and
refuse
the
evil
he
wanted
his
girls
to
be
useful
women
in
the
world
he
put
usefulness
before
happiness
assuring
his
children
that
if
they
followed
the
one
they
would
secure
the
other
belle
therefore
felt
quite
at
home
now
as
she
took
out
pretty
mats
and
laid
them
on
little
tables
in
the
neat
spare
room
which
had
been
arranged
for
the
reception
of
maggie
howland
she
saw
that
all
the
appointments
of
the
room
were
as
perfect
as
simplicity
and
cleanliness
could
effect
and
then
went
out
into
the
summer
garden
to
pick
some
choice
flowers
she
selected
roses
and
carnations
and
bringing
them
in
arranged
them
in
vases
in
the
room
hearing
the
sound
of
wheels
she
flew
eagerly
downstairs
and
met
her
friend
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
little
well
here
i
am
said
maggie
and
how
is
belle
how
of
you
all
to
have
me
and
how
delightful
it
is
to
smell
the
delicious
country
air
mother
and
i
find
town
so
hot
and
stuffy
i
brought
a
great
lot
of
luggage
and
i
am
not
a
bit
smart
but
you
wo
mind
that
will
you
dear
old
belle
you
always
talk
about
not
being
smart
maggie
but
you
manage
to
look
smarter
than
anyone
else
said
isabel
her
eager
brown
eyes
devouring
her
friend
appearance
with
much
curiosity
for
maggie
looked
to
use
a
proverbial
phrase
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
of
a
bandbox
if
she
was
plain
of
face
she
had
an
exceedingly
neat
figure
and
there
was
a
fashionable
trim
look
about
her
which
is
uncommon
in
a
girl
of
her
age
for
maggie
was
only
just
sixteen
and
scarcely
looked
as
much
in
some
ways
she
might
almost
have
been
a
french
girl
so
exceedingly
neat
and
il
was
her
little
person
she
was
built
on
a
scale
and
although
her
face
was
so
plain
she
had
lovely
hands
and
beautiful
small
feet
these
feet
were
always
shod
in
the
most
correct
style
and
she
took
care
of
her
hands
never
allowing
them
to
get
red
or
sunburnt
where
molly
was
her
remark
as
the
two
girls
with
their
arms
twined
round
each
other
entered
the
wide
low
hall
which
was
one
of
the
special
features
of
the
old
rectory
she
has
gone
up
to
see
the
cardews
who
are
the
cardews
why
surely
mags
you
must
have
heard
of
them
you
do
mean
said
maggie
with
a
laugh
and
showing
a
gleam
of
strong
white
teeth
the
two
little
ladies
who
live
in
a
bandbox
oh
you
really
must
not
laugh
at
them
said
isabel
immediately
on
the
defensive
for
her
friends
but
they
do
lead
a
somewhat
exclusive
life
molly
has
gone
up
to
the
castle
as
we
always
call
meredith
manor
to
announce
your
arrival
and
to
ask
permission
to
bring
you
there
to
a
this
afternoon
so
you
will
soon
see
them

yourself
now
come
in
and
say
to
the
mater
she
is
longing
to
see

peterkins

out
maggie
at
that
moment
as
a
small
boy
with
a
smut
across
his
face
suddenly
peeped
round
a
door

said
angrily
maggie
laughed
again

she
said

one
of
the
little
brothers
belle
come
here
at
once
andrew
and
speak
to
miss
howland
the
boy
approached
shyly
then
his
eyes
looked
up
into
the
queer
face
of
the
girl
who
looked
down
at
him
the
sulkiness
cleared
away
from
his
brow
and
he
said
in
an
eager
hurried
way

tristram

not
tired
after
your
journey
from
town
not
in
the
least
thank

tristram
said
maggie
speaking
in
a
voice
of
very
peculiar
quality
it
was
sweet
and
rich
and
full
of
many
intonations
she
had
the
power
of
putting
a
world
of
meaning
into
the
most
commonplace
expressions
tristram
had
not
seen
maggie
before
and
it
was
tristram
who
had
been
completely
bowled
over
by
the
young
lady
just
at
i
bid
you
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
rectory
said
the
good
wife
and
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
time
with
my
children
i
have
a
fascinating
time
said
maggie
i
just
too
delighted
to
come
it
was
sweet
of
you
to
have
me
and
may
i
please
give
you
a
kiss
of
course
you
may
dear
child
said
tristram
maggie
bestowed
the
kiss
and
immediately
afterward
was
conducted
to
her
room
by
the
worshiping
belle
i
do
hope
you
like
it
said
belle
in
an
almost
timorous
voice
i
prepared
it
for
you
myself
why
it
sweet
said
maggie
and
so
full
of
the
country
oh
i
say
what
roses
and
those
carnations
malmaisons
are
they
i
must
wear
a
couple
in
this
brown
holland
frock
they
tone
with
it
perfectly
what
a
delicious
smell
maggie
sniffed
at
the
roses
belle
lounged
on
the
molly
will
be
jealous
she
said
think
of
my
having
you
these
few
moments
all
to
myself
i
am
delighted
to
come
as
you
know
quite
well
replied
maggie
it
all
right
about
school
is
it
belle
yes
quite
quite
right
we
are
to
join
you
there
in
september
it
a
perfectly
splendid
place
said
maggie
i
will
describe
it
to
you
later
on
but
can
it
be
nicer
said
belle
than
our
darling
school
at
hanover
nicer
exclaimed
maggie
you
could
compare
the
two
places
i
tell
you
it
perfect
the
girls
well
they
aristocratic
girls
of
the
upper
ten
it
the
most
select
school
you
are
in
luck
to
be
admitted
i
can
tell
you
you
will
learn
a
lot
about
society
when
you
are
a
member
of
ward
school
but
what
possible
good
will
that
do
us
when
we
are
never
going
into
it
said
belle
maggie
slightly
narrowed
her
already
narrow
eyes
took
off
her
hat
and
combed
back
her
crisp
dark
hair
from
her
low
full
very
broad
forehead
then
she
said
with
a
smile
you
are
to
stay
two
years
at
ward
are
you
not
yes
i
think
that
is
the
arrangement
and
i
am
to
stay
there
for
two
years
said
maggie
i
mean
two
more
i
will
ask
you
isabel
tristram
what
good
society
is
worth
at
the
end
of
your
two
years
i
expect
you
will
tell
me
a
very
different
story
then
at
this
moment
there
came
a
hurried
nervous
excited
knock
at
the
room
door
are
you
coming
miss
miss
maggie
clover
and
dove
and
and
angelus
are
all
waiting
their
hutch
is
beautiful
and
clean
and
i
have
all
their
lettuces
waiting
for
them
just
outside
so
they
begin
to
nibble
till
you
come
do
do
come
please
miss
maggie
of
course
i
will
my
darling
peterkins
replied
maggie
in
her
joyful
voice
oh
this
is
this
is
this
fun
come
along
belle
come
along
but
do
let
poor
jack
get
into
a
temper
said
isabel
in
a
whisper
maggie
took
no
notice
of
her
she
opened
the
bedroom
door
and
flew
downstairs
holding
the
dirty
hot
little
hand
of
andrew
peterkins
while
isabel
followed
in
their
wake
in
a
part
of
the
rectory
garden
on
a
bit
of
waste
land
at
the
other
side
of
the
great
vegetable
garden
were
two
hutches
which
stood
side
by
side
and
these
hutches
contained
those
most
adorable
creatures
the
pets
the
darlings
of
the
tristram
boys
the
tristram
boys
were
aged
eleven
and
ten
years
respectively
jack
was
eleven
andrew
ten
they
were
very
sturdy
healthy
fine
little
fellows
at
present
they
went
to
a
good
in
the
neighborhood
but
were
to
be
sent
to
a
about
the
same
time
as
their
sisters
were
to
begin
their
education
at
aylmer
house
in
kensington
their
passion
above
all
things
was
for
pets
they
had
tried
every
sort
white
mice
these
somehow
or
other
were
sacrificed
to
the
reigning
cat
and
waltzing
mice
that
shared
an
equally
luckless
fate
these
were
followed
by
white
rats
which
got
into
the
garden
and
did
mischief
and
were
banished
by
order
of
the
rector
who
was
a
most
determined
master
in
his
own
house
dogs
were
also
forbidden
except
one
very
intelligent
airedale
that
belonged
to
the
whole
family
and
to
no
one
in
particular
but
the
boys
must
find
vent
for
their
passion
in
some
way
and
rabbits
were
allowed
them
at
the
present
moment
jack
owned
five
andrew
four
in
trembling
triumph
andrew
brought
his
new
friend
to
see
his
darlings
he
greatly
hoped
that
jack
would
not
appear
on
the
scene
just
now
while
maggie
was
up
in
her
bedroom
taking
off
her
hat
he
had
with
herculean
strength
managed
to
move
an
old
wooden
door
and
put
it
in
such
a
position
that
jack
hutch
was
completely
hidden
while
his
hutch
shone
forth
in
all
its
glory
with
those
fascinating
creatures
angelus
dove
and
clover
looking
through
their
at
the
tempting
meal
that
awaited
them
here
they
are
here
they
are
said
andrew
beauties
all
four
my
own
my
very
own
maggie
you
may
share
one
of
them
with
me
while
you
are
here
he
must
live
in
his
hutch
but
he
shall
be
yours
and
mine
would
you
like
he
is
a
character
he
the
finest
old
cove
you
ever
came
across
in
your
life
look
at
him
now
pretending
he
does
care
anything
at
all
for
his
lettuce
and
he
just
dying
for
it
clover
is
the
greedy
one
clover
would
eat
till
if
i
let
him
as
to
angelus
she
squeaks
sometimes
you
hear
her
if
you
listen
hard
that
why
i
called
her
angelus
and
dove
why
she
a
dear
pet
but
the
character
of
all
is
you
like
to
share
him
with
me
would
you
maggie
yes
yes
he
is
so
ugly
he
is
quite
interesting
said
maggie
she
flung
herself
on
the
ground
by
the
side
of
the
hutch
and
gazed
in
at
the
occupants
as
though
her
only
aim
in
life
was
to
worship
rabbits
you
take
that
leaf
of
lettuce
and
give
it
to
your
very
own
self
said
peterkins
he
love
you
ever
after
he
a
most
affectionate
old
fellow
maggie
proceeded
to
feed
the
rabbit
peterkins
hopped
about
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
he
had
seldom
experienced
before
maggie
asked
innumerable
questions
belle
seated
herself
on
the
fallen
trunk
of
an
old
and
looked
on
in
wonder
maggie
was
a
curious
girl
she
seemed
to
have
a
power
over
every
one
there
was
andrew
such
a
shy
little
fellow
as
a
rule
simply
pouring
out
his
heart
to
her
suddenly
belle
rose
it
time
for
lunch
she
said
and
you
must
be
hungry
andrew
go
straight
to
the
house
and
wash
your
face
and
hands
no
lady
would
sit
down
to
lunch
with
such
a
dirty
boy
as
you
are
oh
i
say
am
i
said
andrew
do
you
think
so
maggie

are
a
most
little
scamp
said
maggie

once
and
get
clean

said
maggie
i
do
wish

but
clean
hands
and
face
well
they
are
essential
to
the
ordinary
british
boy
if
he
a
gentleman
i
am
your
gentleman
for
evermore
said
andrew
i
think
you
are
peterkins
then
i
off
to
clean
up
said
the
small
boy
i
say
andrew
cried
his
sister
before
you
go
take
that
door
away
from
jack
hutch
he
be
so
furious
at
your
keeping
the
light
and
air
away
from
his
rabbits
not
i
ca
be
bothered
said
peterkins
please
take
it
away
at
once
said
maggie
andrew
brow
puckered
into
a
frown
but
you
see
and
he
got
five
he
said
in
a
most
distressed
voice
honor
bright
said
maggie
i
turn
my
back
and
shut
my
eyes
jackdaw
shall
show
me
his
rabbits
himself
peterkins
immediately
removed
the
door
dragging
it
to
its
former
place
where
it
leaned
against
a
high
wall
he
then
rushed
up
to
maggie
i
done
it
he
said
promise
you
wo
like
his
bunnies
ca
said
maggie
for
i
love
well
at
least

maggie
again
for
i
shall
i
die
of
raging
jealousy
said
peterkins
no

wo
you
silly
boy
get
off
to
the
house
and
make
yourself
tidy
come
along
belle
i
say
maggie
said
belle
you
must
set
those
two
boys
by
the
ears
they
fond
enough
of
each
other
of
course
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
maggie
that
a
charming
little
chap
and
is
my
rabbit
as
well
as
his
jackdaw
shall
share
two
of
his
rabbits
with
me
oh
it
is
such
fun
turning
people
round
your
little
finger
just
then
molly
rather
red
in
the
face
ran
up
oh
you
darling
darling
maggie
she
said
so
you
come
come
cried
maggie
i
feel
as
if
i
been
here
for
ever
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
molly
she
kissed
her
friend
rapturously
maggie
presented
a
cool
firm
round
cheek
oh
how
sweet
you
look
mags
do
talk
nonsense
molly
i
not
a
bit
to
me
said
molly
with
fervor
you
the
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
wide
world
i
very
ugly
and
you
know
that
perfectly
well
said
maggie
but
now
do
let
talk
of
looks
whatever
were
you
doing
in
this
part
of
the
garden
inquired
molly
oh
she
was
making
love
to
andrew
remarked
belle
she
calls
him
peterkins
and
he
allows
it
and
he
has
given
her
of
and
she
means
to
make
love
to
jack
and
he
to
give
her
a
couple
of
his
rabbits
i
mean
to
share
them
with
her
she
more
extraordinary
than
ever
more
altogether
out
of
the
common
as
if
i
did
know
that
said
molly
it
all
right
about
this
afternoon
maggie
oh
what
do
you
think
we
to
stay
to
supper
and
i
have
a
special
invitation
for
father
and
mother
to
come
and
join
us
then
wo
it
be
fun
i
do
wonder
maggie
if
you
will
like
the
cardew
girls
probably
not
replied
maggie
in
a
very
calm
voice
but
at
least
i
can
promise
you
one
thing
they
both
like
me
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
replied
belle
with
fervor
they
entered
the
house
and
soon
found
themselves
seated
round
the
table
tristram
greeted
maggie
with
his
usual
gentle
dignity
molly
delivered
herself
of
her
message
from
the
castle
and
tristram
said
that
they
would
be
delighted
to
join
the
cardews
at
supper
the
meal
was
proceeding
cheerfully
and
maggie
was
entertaining
her
host
and
hostess
by
just
those
pleasant
little
pieces
of
information
which
an
exceedingly
girl
can
impart
without
apparently
intending
to
do
so
when
a
shy
and
very
clean
little
figure
glided
into
the
room
a
pair
of
eyes
looked
fixedly
at
maggie
and
then
glared
defiance
at
belle
who
happened
to
be
seated
near
that
adorable
young
person
peterkins
was
making
up
his
mind
that
in
future
that
coveted
seat
should
be
his
for
he
and
maggie
could
talk
in
whispers
during
the
meal
about
angelus
and
the
rest
when
his
father
said
sit
down
my
boy
take
your
place
at
once
you
are
rather
late
the
boy
slipped
into
his
seat
i
am
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
tidy
andrew
said
his
mother
approvingly
andrew
looked
across
at
maggie
maggie
did
not
once
glance
at
him
she
was
talking
in
her
gentle
tone
to
the
rector
presently
another
boy
came
in
bigger
and
broader
than
andrew
andrew
said
in
a
raised
voice
here
jack
and
his
hands
are
a
bit
clean
hush
said
the
rector
jack
flushed
and
looked
defiantly
at
maggie
maggie
raised
her
eyes
and
gave
him
a
sweet
glance
are
you
really
jack
she
said
i
am
so
glad
to
know
you
i
have
been
making
friends
with
your
brother
andrew
whom
i
call
peterkins
i
want
to
call
you
jackdaw
may
i
jack
felt
a
great
lump
in
his
throat
his
face
was
scarlet
he
felt
unable
to
speak
but
he
nodded
i
have
been
looking
at
peterkins
rabbits
continued
maggie
i
want
to
see
yours
after
lunch
they
beauties
burst
from
jack
they
ever
so
many
times
better
than
andrew
i
got
a
angora
his
name
is
fanciful
and
i
got
hush
my
boy
hush
said
the
rector
not
so
much
talking
during
meals
well
maggie
my
dear
we
must
of
course
call
you
by
your
christian
name
of
course
tristram
i
should
indeed
feel
strange
if
you
did
we
are
delighted
to
see
you
continued
the
rector
and
you
must
tell
the
girls
all
about
your
new
school
and
you
too
sir
said
maggie
in
her
soft
rich
voice
oh
be
delighted
delighted
there
never
was
such
a
woman
as
mrs
ward
i
took
a
very
great
liking
to
her
said
the
rector
i
think
my
girls
fortunate
to
be
placed
under
her
care
she
has
been
good
very
good
and
kind
to
me
and
mine
i
wonder
what
he
means
by
that
thought
maggie
but
she
made
no
remark
aloud
chapter
iii
lady
lysle
at
about
a
quarter
to
four
that
same
afternoon
three
girls
prepared
to
walk
over
to
meredith
manor
it
was
for
such
golden
opportunities
that
molly
and
isabel
kept
their
best
frocks
it
was
for
just
such
occasions
that
they
arrayed
themselves
most
neatly
and
becomingly
their
dress
it
must
be
owned
was
limited
in
quantity
and
also
in
quality
but
on
the
present
occasion
in
their
pretty
white
spotted
muslins
with
sashes
round
their
waists
and
white
muslin
hats
to
match
they
looked
as
charming
a
young
pair
of
english
girls
as
could
be
found
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
it
is
true
their
feet
were
not
nearly
as
perfectly
shod
as
maggie
nor
were
their
gloves
quite
so
immaculate
but
then
they
were
going
to
play
tennis
and
shoes
and
gloves
did
not
greatly
matter
in
the
country
maggie
thought
otherwise
her
tan
exactly
toned
with
her
neatly
fitting
brown
holland
dress
the
little
hat
she
wore
on
her
head
was
made
of
brown
straw
trimmed
very
simply
with
ribbon
it
was
an
ugly
hat
but
on
maggie
head
it
seemed
to
complete
her
dress
to
be
a
part
of
her
so
that
no
one
noticed
in
the
least
what
she
wore
except
that
she
looked
all
right
two
boys
with
worshiping
eyes
watched
the
trio
as
they
stepped
down
the
rectory
avenue
and
disappeared
from
view
two
boys
fought
a
little
afterward
but
made
it
up
again
and
then
lay
on
the
grass
side
by
side
and
discussed
maggie
pulling
her
to
pieces
in
one
sense
but
adoring
her
all
the
same
meanwhile
the
girls
themselves
chatted
as
girls
will
when
the
heart
is
light
and
there
is
no
care
anywhere
it
was
very
hot
even
hotter
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
but
when
they
reached
the
road
shaded
so
beautifully
by
the
they
found
a
delicious
breeze
which
fanned
their
faces
somehow
maggie
never
seemed
to
suffer
from
weather
at
all
she
was
never
too
cold
she
was
never
too
hot
she
was
never
ill
no
one
had
ever
heard
her
complain
of
ache
or
pain
she
was
always
joyous
except
when
she
was
sympathizing
with
somebody
sorrow
and
then
her
sympathy
was
detached
that
is
it
did
not
make
her
personally
sad
although
it
affected
and
helped
the
person
who
was
the
recipient
of
it
to
a
most
remarkable
extent
one
of
maggie
great
attractions
was
her
absolute
health
her
undiminished
strength
the
fact
that
she
could
endure
almost
any
exertion
without
showing
a
trace
of
fatigue
molly
and
isabel
were
also
strong
hearty
girls
and
the
excitement
of
this
expedition
caused
them
to
chatter
more
volubly
than
usual
maggie
had
a
good
deal
to
tell
them
with
regard
to
the
new
school
and
they
had
a
great
deal
to
tell
her
with
regard
to
the
cardews
just
as
they
were
entering
the
avenue
maggie
turned
and
faced
her
two
companions
may
i
say
something
she
asked
eagerly
why
of
course
mags
said
molly
well
it
this
from
what
you
told
me
of
your
friends
they
must
be
the
most
profoundly
uninteresting
girls
oh
no
indeed
they
are
not
said
isabel
stanchly
merry
has
a
great
deal
in
her
and
cicely
is
so
we
think
she
will
be
beautiful
but
merry
undoubtedly
has
the
most
character
then
there
is
something
dignified
and
aristocratic
about
them
and
yet
they
are
not
really
proud
although
they
might
be
for
they
are
so
rich
and
meredith
manor
is
such
a
wonderful
old
house
did
you
tell
me
said
maggie
that
meredith
manor
belonged
to
mrs
cardew
did
i
said
isabel
coloring
in
some
confusion
i
am
sure
i
know
i
do
remember
saying
it
i
do
think
cardew
is
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
call
anything
hers
apart
from
her
husband
she
is
devoted
to
him
and
no
wonder
for
he
is
quite
charming
he
is
nearly
as
charming
as
father
and
that
saying
a
great
deal
do
let
come
on
we
be
late
said
molly
impatiently
no
not
quite
yet
please
said
maggie
i
want
to
understand
the
position
cardew
was
a
miss
meredith
yes
dear
maggie
but
what
does
that
matter
and
continued
maggie
she
was
the
heiress
of
meredith
manor
i
suppose
so
father
can
tell
you
exactly
oh
i
do
want
to
question
him
but
i
want
to
get
my
bearings
on
the
mother
side
the
cardew
girls
belong
to
the
country
is
that
so
yes
yes
yes
do
come
on
but
their
father
continued
maggie
he
is
in
trade
is
he
he
a
perfect
gentleman
said
isabel
stoutly
no
one
looks
down
on
trade
in
these
days
of
course
not
i
adore
trade
myself
said
maggie
she
now
proceeded
to
walk
very
slowly
up
the
avenue
she
was
evidently
thinking
hard
after
a
time
she
said
i
mean
to
get
those
girls
to
come
to
school
with
you
molly
and
with
you
isabel
in
september
both
the
tristrams
burst
into
a
peal
of
merry
laughter
oh
mags
they
cried
we
never
did
think
before
that
you
were
conceited
you
certainly
overrate
even
your
powers
when
you
imagine
that
you
will
get
cardew
to
change
his
mind
what
do
you
mean
by
his
changing
his
mind
why
this
said
belle
he
has
set
his
face
from
the
very
first
against
his
girls
leaving
home
he
wishes
them
to
have
a
home
education
and
that
alone
oh
that
is
all
right
said
maggie
cheerfully
well
what
will
you
bet
girls
that
i
have
my
way
we
do
want
you
to
lose
maggie
but
you
certainly
will
not
get
your
way
in
this
particular
well
now
i
am
going
to
be
generous
i
am
not
rich
but
i
have
got
two
gold
bracelets
at
home
and
i
will
give
one
to
each
of
you
for
your
very
own
if
i
succeed
in
bringing
cicely
and
merry
cardew
to
ward
school
oh
oh
exclaimed
both
the
tristram
girls
you
get
your
bracelets
said
maggie
in
a
most
confident
tone
and
i
can
assure
you
they
are
beauties
my
darling
father
brought
them
from
india
years
and
years
ago
he
brought
a
lot
of
jewels
for
mother
and
me
and
i
will
get
the
bracelets
for
you
one
each
if
i
succeed
but
you
must
allow
me
to
manage
things
my
own
way
but
you
wo
do
anything
anything
to
upset
the
cardews
said
isabel
upset
them
said
maggie
well
yes
i
do
mean
to
upset
them
i
mean
to
alter
their
lives
i
mean
to
turn
things
topsyturvy
for
them
but
i
manage
it
in
such
a
fashion
that
neither
you
nor
molly
nor
your
father
nor
your
mother
nor
anyone
will
suspect
how
i
have
got
my
way
but
get
it
i
will
i
thought
i
tell
you
that
all
you
like
to
have
them
at
school
with
you
would
you
oh
yes
very
much
indeed
said
molly
i
am
not
so
sure
said
isabel
it
rather
fun
coming
back
to
the
rectory
in
the
holidays
and
telling
the
cardew
girls
all
about
what
we
do
and
how
we
spend
our
time
there
be
nothing
to
tell
them
if
we
all
go
to
the
same
school
well
said
maggie
i
do
agree
with
you
i
expect
on
the
contrary
you
find
a
vast
lot
more
to
talk
about
but
come
hurry
now
i
want
to
be
introduced
to
them
for
i
have
no
time
to
lose
neither
isabel
nor
molly
could
quite
make
out
why
they
felt
a
certain
depression
after
maggie
howland
had
explained
her
views
the
thought
of
the
possible
possession
of
the
bracelets
did
not
greatly
elate
them
besides
there
was
not
the
most
remote
chance
of
even
such
a
fascinating
young
person
as
maggie
succeeding
in
her
project
she
would
meet
her
match
if
not
in
cardew
then
in
cardew
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
but
they
greatly
wished
she
would
not
try
they
did
not
want
her
to
upset
the
placid
existence
of
their
young
friends
the
girls
who
lived
at
the
castle
the
girls
who
pursued
their
sheltered
happy
refined
life
were
in
a
manner
mysterious
and
remote
to
the
young
tristrams
and
they
thought
that
they
would
not
love
them
any
more
if
they
were
brought
into
closer
contact
with
them
a
turn
in
the
avenue
now
brought
the
old
into
view
some
friends
of
cardew
had
arrived
but
there
were
no
other
young
people
to
be
seen
cicely
and
merry
were
standing
talking
to
a
lady
of
middle
age
who
had
come
to
pay
an
afternoon
call
when
cicely
found
herself
changing
color
and
glancing
eagerly
at
merry
oh
will
you
excuse
me
she
said
in
her
pretty
refined
voice
our
special
friends
the
tristrams
the
rector
daughters
and
a
friend
of
theirs
a
miss
howland
are
coming
up
the
avenue
certainly
my
dear
said
lady
lysle
and
cicely
and
merry
were
off
down
the
avenue
like
arrows
from
the
bow
to
meet
their
friends
lady
lysle
watched
the
two
girls
and
then
turned
to
speak
to
cardew
what
name
was
that
i
heard
cicely
say
was
her
remark
of
course
i
know
the
tristrams
but
who
was
the
girl
who
was
with
them
a
special
friend
of
theirs
a
miss
howland
she
has
been
their
school
companion
abroad
she
is
staying
with
them
at
the
rectory
why
what
is
the
matter
lady
lysle
do
you
know
anything
about
her
i
do
know
her
said
lady
lysle
but
i
know
a
little
bit
about
her
mother
i
should
not
have
supposed
the
tristram
girls
and
miss
howland
were
in
the
same
set
why
what
is
wrong
said
cardew
who
was
exceedingly
particular
as
regarded
the
people
whom
her
daughters
knew
oh
nothing
nothing
said
lady
lysle
i
happen
not
particularly
to
like
howland
but
doubtless
i
am
prejudiced
she
turned
to
talk
to
a
neighbor
and
by
this
time
the
five
girls
had
met
there
was
an
eager
interchange
of
greetings
and
then
maggie
found
herself
walking
up
the
avenue
by
merry
side
while
cicely
found
a
place
between
the
two
tristram
girls
i
am
so
glad
you
come
said
merry
in
her
gentle
polite
voice
it
is
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
replied
maggie
do
you
know
she
added
turning
and
fixing
her
curious
eyes
on
her
companion
face
that
i
am
one
of
those
poor
girls
who
have
never
seen
a
beautiful
house
like
yours
before
i
am
so
glad
you
like
our
house
said
merry
but
you
have
seen
it
yet
i
am
looking
at
it
now
so
this
is
what
i
am
accustomed
to
hear
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
of
england
it
certainly
is
a
home
said
merry
and
an
old
one
too
parts
of
the
manor
have
been
centuries
in
existence
but
some
parts
of
course
are
comparatively
new
will
you
take
me
all
over
it
miss
cardew
asked
maggie
indeed
i
shall
be
delighted
but
you
must
come
another
day
for
that
for
we
want
to
make
up
some
sets
of
tennis
without
any
delay
we
have
all
our
afternoon
planned
out
there
are
three
or
four
young
people
who
may
arrive
any
moment
so
that
we
shall
be
able
to
make
two
good
sets
how
wonderful
it
all
is
said
maggie
who
kept
on
looking
at
the
house
with
admiration
and
did
not
seem
particularly
keen
about
tennis
do
you
like
tennis
miss
miss
howland
said
merry
oh
yes
replied
maggie
after
a
pause
but
then
i
think
she
added
after
yet
another
pause
that
i
like
every
nice
thing
in
all
the
world
how
delightful
that
must
be
said
merry
becoming
more
and
more
attracted
by
maggie
each
moment
and
you
know
a
lot
too
do
you
for
you
have
seen
so
much
of
the
world
i
know
very
little
replied
maggie
and
as
to
having
seen
the
world
that
is
to
come
i
am
quite
young
you
know
only
just
sixteen
but
isabel
and
molly
told
me
that
you
knew
more
than
any
other
girl
of
their
acquaintance
maggie
gave
a
cheerful
laugh
and
said
you
must
mind
what
they
say
poor
darlings
the
fact
is
they
fond
of
me
and
they
magnify
my
knowledge
but
in
reality
it
does
exist
only
i
must
tell
you
miss
cardew
i
mean
to
see
everything
and
to
know
everything
i
mean
to
have
a
glorious
future
the
enthusiasm
in
the
charming
voice
was
also
seen
to
shine
through
those
queer
narrow
eyes
merry
felt
her
heart
beat
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
in
return
she
said
speaking
for
a
wonder
without
diffidence
for
she
was
naturally
very
shy
and
retiring
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
could
live
a
glorious
life
such
as
you
describe
and
surely
you
can
said
maggie
no
i
must
be
satisfied
with
a
very
quiet
life
but
we
wo
talk
of
it
now
i
am
really
very
happy
i
should
consider
myself
a
most
wicked
discontented
girl
were
i
anything
else
and
please
may
i
take
you
to
see
mother
merry
brought
up
her
new
friend
to
introduce
her
to
cardew
who
for
the
first
moment
remembering
what
lady
lysle
had
said
was
a
trifle
stiff
to
maggie
howland
but
two
minutes
afterward
was
chatting
to
her
in
a
pleasant
and
very
friendly
manner
she
even
went
the
length
of
personally
introducing
maggie
to
lady
lysle
excusing
herself
for
the
act
by
saying
that
lady
lysle
knew
her
mother
maggie
also
succeeded
in
charming
lady
lysle
who
said
to
cardew
afterward
i
am
glad
you
have
introduced
the
girl
to
me
she
is
not
in
the
least
like
her
commonplace
affected
mother
she
seems
a
very
good
sort
and
i
like
plain
girls
but
is
she
plain
said
cardew
in
some
astonishment
do
you
know
i
never
noticed
it
lady
lysle
laughed
you
never
noticed
how
remarkably
plain
that
girl
is
my
dear
friend
she
said
to
be
frank
with
you
said
cardew
i
did
think
of
her
face
at
all
she
has
a
pretty
manner
and
a
nice
sensible
agreeable
way
of
talking
i
do
not
think
my
girls
can
suffer
injury
from
her
they
seem
to
like
her
at
any
rate
said
lady
lysle
looking
significantly
as
she
spoke
at
the
distant
part
of
the
grounds
where
maggie
with
cicely
at
one
side
of
her
and
merry
at
the
other
was
talking
eagerly
oh
yes
she
seems
a
nice
child
continued
the
great
lady
and
it
would
be
unfair
to
judge
a
girl
because
her
mother
is
not
to
one
taste
but
is
there
anything
really
objectionable
in
the
mother
asked
cardew
nothing
whatsoever
except
that
she
is
pushing
vulgar
and
shallow
i
am
under
the
impression
that
the
howlands
are
exceedingly
poor
of
course
they
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
that
but
how
the
mother
can
manage
to
send
the
girl
to
expensive
schools
puzzles
me
ah
well
said
gardew
in
her
gentle
voice
the
child
is
evidently
very
different
from
her
mother
and
i
must
respect
the
mother
for
doing
her
best
to
get
her
girl
well
educated
your
girls
are
not
going
to
school
are
they
sylvia
asked
lady
lysle
mine
of
course
not
their
father
would
hear
of
it
on
the
whole
i
think
he
is
right
said
lady
lysle
though
there
are
advantages
in
schools
now
that
school
at
kensington
aylmer
house
which
my
dear
friend
ward
conducts
with
such
skill
and
marvelous
dexterity
is
a
place
where
any
girl
might
receive
advantages
is
it
possible
said
cardew
that
ward
is
your
friend
my
very
great
friend
dear
i
have
known
her
all
my
life
aylmer
house
is
particularly
select
my
niece
aneta
is
at
the
school
and
her
mother
is
charmed
with
it
but
that
is
very
strange
said
gardew
after
a
pause
you
must
talk
to
our
rector
when
he
comes
oh
yes
of
course
stay
to
supper
i
can
not
i
regret
to
say
well
then
if
you
wo
there
no
use
in
pressing
you
but
i
have
something
curious
to
say
the
rector
two
little
girls
are
going
to
aylmer
house
in
september
and
that
little
miss
howland
whom
i
just
introduced
to
you
is
also
one
of
the
girls
under
ward
care
then
she
will
do
well
said
lady
lysle
alter
a
pause
during
which
her
face
looked
very
thoughtful
i
wonder
if
she
knows
your
niece
said
cardew
lady
lysle
laughed
i
presume
she
does
the
school
only
contains
twenty
boarders
never
any
more
i
happen
to
know
that
there
are
two
vacancies
at
the
present
moment
really
if
i
were
you
sylvia
i
would
give
your
girls
a
couple
of
years
there
it
would
do
them
a
world
of
good
and
they
would
acquire
some
slight
knowledge
of
the
world
before
they
enter
it
impossible
quite
impossible
said
cardew
their
father
would
never
consent
chapter
iv
power
was
everything
to
maggie
meanwhile
the
young
people
enjoyed
themselves
vastly
maggie
was
very
modest
with
regard
to
her
tennis
but
she
quickly
proved
that
she
could
play
better
than
any
one
else
at
the
manor
that
day
the
visitors
walking
about
the
grounds
paused
to
remark
on
her
excellent
play
and
to
inquire
who
she
was
she
took
her
little
triumph
very
modestly
saying
that
she
was
rather
surprised
at
herself
and
supposed
that
it
was
the
fresh
and
delicious
air
of
the
country
which
had
put
her
into
such
good
form
she
is
ridiculously
overmodest
said
isabel
tristram
to
merry
for
she
always
did
play
every
sort
of
game
better
than
the
rest
of
us
she
is
not
quite
so
good
at
her
books
except
indeed
at
certain
things
such
as
recitation
i
wish
you
could
see
and
hear
her
then
she
is
almost
a
genius
she
looks
like
one
inspired
i
think
her
quite
delightful
said
merry
and
as
to
being
plain
i
told
you
did
i
said
belle
that
you
never
notice
her
looks
after
you
had
seen
her
for
a
minute
or
two
it
was
time
for
the
family
to
go
into
the
house
for
supper
at
meredith
manor
the
three
girls
from
the
rectory
were
taken
upstairs
to
a
spacious
bedroom
to
wash
their
hands
and
brush
their
hair
molly
and
isabel
were
both
most
anxious
to
know
what
maggie
thought
of
cicely
and
merry
what
i
think
of
them
said
maggie
oh
they
and
not
really
dull
at
all
and
the
whole
place
is
lovely
and
all
the
people
i
met
were
so
nice
except
indeed
that
lady
lysle
lady
lysle
exclaimed
molly
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
why
she
is
cardew
greatest
friend
do
you
mean
to
say
you
were
introduced
to
her
yes
cardew
was
kind
enough
to
do
so
though
i
am
sure
i
want
it
at
all
but
i
ca
imagine
why
she
did
it
said
molly
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
cardew
never
introduces
either
of
us
to
the
people
well
her
ostensible
reason
said
maggie
was
that
lady
lysle
knows
my
mother
does
she
indeed
said
isabel
in
a
tone
of
great
respect
but
that
does
make
me
like
her
any
the
better
said
maggie
and
now
i
will
tell
you
why
girls
only
you
must
faithfully
promise
you
wo
repeat
it
to
any
one
of
course
not
said
the
girls
eagerly
who
were
accustomed
to
receive
secrets
from
their
schoolfellows
though
maggie
as
a
rule
never
gave
her
secrets
to
anyone
well
i
will
tell
you
said
maggie
the
color
flushing
into
her
face
and
then
leaving
it
pale
again
aneta
lysle
is
one
of
the
girls
at
aylmer
house
she
is
lady
lysle
niece
and
well
you
know
i
am
tolerant
enough
but
i
ca
bear
aneta
lysle
molly
and
isabel
were
silent
for
a
minute
if
ca
bear
her
said
isabel
then
i
do
suppose
like
her
either
when
we
go
to
the
school
oh
yes
you
will
you
adore
her
sure
to
now
promise
once
again
that
you
will
never
repeat
this
we
certainly
will
not
said
molly
isabel
nodded
emphatically
we
do
tell
secrets
she
said
then
she
added
we
had
best
go
downstairs
now
if
you
quite
tidy
mags
during
supper
that
night
cardew
who
found
herself
seated
near
her
favorite
rector
began
to
ply
him
with
questions
with
regard
to
aylmer
house
how
had
he
heard
of
it
and
why
had
he
specially
fixed
on
that
establishment
for
his
daughters
the
rector
smiled
he
had
twinkling
dark
eyes
and
they
now
looked
down
the
long
table
until
they
rested
for
a
brief
moment
on
young
figure
she
was
talking
to
cardew
who
stately
and
reserved
as
he
was
took
her
remarks
with
tolerance
a
nice
unaffected
child
he
kept
saying
to
himself
and
neither
did
he
remark
how
plain
she
was
that
young
person
yonder
said
tristram
to
cardew
is
the
influence
that
has
induced
me
to
make
arrangements
for
my
girls
at
aylmer
house
miss
howland
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
are
influenced
by
a
schoolgirl
tristram
looked
grave
in
this
case
i
may
as
well
confess
at
once
that
i
have
been
influenced
he
said
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
the
child
from
molly
and
isabel
for
they
were
all
three
at
the
same
excellent
school
in
hanover
i
met
little
miss
howland
when
i
was
in
london
at
christmas
being
such
a
great
friend
of
my
children
i
naturally
talked
to
her
she
told
me
of
ward
and
of
the
new
delightful
school
to
which
she
was
going
she
certainly
never
once
pressed
me
to
send
my
girls
there
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
visit
ward
and
see
if
it
could
be
arranged
my
girls
are
quite
proficient
for
their
ages
in
foreign
languages
but
i
want
them
now
thoroughly
to
learn
literature
and
english
history
and
also
those
numerous
small
accomplishments
which
are
so
necessary
for
a
gentlewoman
there
is
also
no
place
in
the
world
like
london
in
my
opinion
for
hearing
good
music
and
seeing
good
art
i
saw
ward
a
short
interview
with
her
was
i
could
not
desire
to
put
my
girls
in
safer
hands
cardew
listened
very
attentively
then
you
think
tristram
she
said
after
a
pause
that
is
really
good
for
girls
in
my
humble
opinion
cardew
it
is
essential
a
girl
must
find
her
level
she
can
only
find
it
at
school
then
what
about
my
dear
girls
said
cardew
the
rector
bowed
in
a
very
courteous
manner
may
not
be
really
necessary
for
them
he
said
although
you
know
my
opinion
in
short
you
know
what
i
would
do
with
them
did
they
belong
to
me
cardew
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
continued
the
conversation
by
saying
it
is
really
a
curious
fact
that
lady
lysle
my
great
friend
who
was
here
this
afternoon
spoke
to
me
in
terms
of
the
warmest
approbation
with
regard
to
ward
and
aylmer
house
she
says
that
her
own
niece
aneta
is
a
member
of
the
school
she
further
said
that
there
were
two
vacancies
at
present
and
she
urged
me
to
send
my
girls
there
but
alas
i
can
not
do
that
for
their
father
would
not
hear
of
it
i
do
wish
he
would
hear
of
it
said
tristram
with
some
feeling
you
will
never
have
your
girls
properly
taught
unless
they
go
to
school
it
is
impossible
at
this
distance
from
london
to
command
the
services
of
the
best
masters
and
governesses
you
will
not
have
a
resident
governess
in
the
house
forgive
me
if
i
speak
freely
dear
lady
but
i
love
your
children
as
though
they
were
my
own
and
if
you
could
persuade
cardew
to
seize
this
opportunity
and
let
them
go
to
school
with
molly
and
isabel
i
am
certain
you
would
never
regret
it
i
wish
i
could
persuade
him
said
cardew
more
particularly
as
that
excellent
music
master
bennett
has
just
written
to
say
he
must
discontinue
giving
his
as
the
distance
from
warwick
is
too
far
for
his
health
and
miss
beverley
their
daily
governess
has
also
broken
down
but
there
i
know
my
husband
never
will
agree
to
part
with
the
girls
then
the
next
best
thing
said
tristram
speaking
in
a
cheerful
tone
is
for
you
to
take
up
your
abode
in
your
london
house
and
give
the
girls
the
advantages
of
masters
and
mistresses
straight
from
the
metropolis
why
you
will
be
bringing
them
out
in
a
couple
of
years
cardew
and
you
would
like
them
to
have
all
possible
advantages
first
something
must
be
done
certainly
said
cardew
and
i
like
that
girl
miss
howland
although
lady
lysle
seemed
prejudiced
against
her
at
first
oh
she
is
a
girl
in
a
thousand
said
tristram
so
and
amiable
and
agreeable
see
how
she
is
talking
to
your
husband
at
this
very
moment
i
never
saw
a
nicer
or
more
modest
young
creature
but
she
is
so
exceedingly
clever
that
she
will
push
her
own
way
anywhere
she
has
bowled
over
my
two
young
urchins
already
although
she
has
been
only
a
few
hours
at
the
rectory
what
could
lady
lysle
have
to
say
against
maggie
howland
oh
nothing
nothing
at
all
and
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
but
it
seems
she
does
not
much
care
for
mrs
howland
i
think
i
can
explain
that
said
tristram
howland
means
well
but
is
a
rather
silly
sort
of
woman
the
girl
manages
her
in
the
sweetest
way
the
girl
herself
takes
after
her
father
poor
howland
the
african
explorer
who
lost
his
life
in
his
country
cause
he
had
i
am
told
a
most
remarkable
personality
when
molly
and
isabel
tristram
accompanied
by
maggie
howland
the
rector
and
his
wife
walked
back
to
the
rectory
that
evening
maggie
was
in
excellent
spirits
it
was
natural
that
the
three
young
people
should
start
on
in
front
maggie
talked
on
various
subjects
but
although
the
tristrams
were
most
anxious
to
get
opinions
from
her
with
regard
to
the
cardews
she
could
not
be
led
to
talk
of
them
until
they
were
approaching
the
house
it
was
now
nearly
eleven
and
a
perfect
summer
night
the
boys
jack
and
andrew
had
gone
to
bed
but
a
few
lights
were
twinkling
here
and
there
in
the
dear
old
rectory
oh
i
am
not
a
scrap
sleepy
said
maggie
this
air
stimulates
one
it
is
splendid
by
the
way
girls
she
added
suddenly
turning
and
facing
her
companions
would
you
like
your
bracelets
to
have
rubies
in
them
or
sapphires
nonsense
said
molly
turning
crimson
belle
laughed
you
do
suppose
you
are
accomplishing
that
she
said
maggie
spoke
rather
slowly
mother
has
one
dozen
bracelets
in
her
father
brought
them
to
her
in
the
course
of
his
travels
some
he
got
in
india
and
some
in
africa
they
are
very
valuable
and
exceedingly
quaint
and
i
recall
now
to
my
memory
and
clearly
in
my
mind
eye
one
lovely
gold
bracelet
fashioned
like
a
snake
and
with
eyes
of
ruby
and
another
which
i
think
he
must
have
got
at
colombo
that
consists
of
a
broad
gold
band
studded
here
and
there
with
sapphires
how
pretty
those
bracelets
would
look
on
your
dear
little
arms
molly
and
isabel
and
how
glad
how
very
very
glad
your
maggie
will
be
to
give
them
to
you
and
of
course
when
you
do
give
them
to
us
we
be
delighted
to
have
them
said
molly
and
isabel
then
isabel
laughed
and
said
but
what
is
the
good
of
counting
your
chickens
before
they
hatched
i
consider
my
chickens
hatched
was
maggie
remark
what
fun
we
shall
all
have
together
next
winter
aneta
wo
have
much
chance
against
us
yes
girls
of
course
i
like
your
friends
cicely
and
merry
but
they
be
twice
three
times
the
girls
they
are
when
they
have
been
for
a
short
time
at
ward
school
are
you
tired
maggie
was
molly
remark
would
you
like
to
go
to
bed
i
am
not
a
scrap
tired
and
i
do
want
to
go
to
bed
at
all
but
i
suppose
that
means
that
you
would
well
i
must
own
to
feeling
a
little
sleepy
said
molly
and
so
am
i
said
belle
girls
girls
come
in
your
father
wants
to
lock
up
called
tristram
at
that
moment
the
girls
all
entered
the
house
lit
their
candles
and
went
upstairs
to
their
rooms
as
maggie
was
wishing
her
two
dear
friends
she
said
quietly
i
hope
you
wo
mind
but
merry
cardew
or
as
i
ought
to
call
her
miss
cardew
has
asked
me
to
go
over
to
the
manor
morning
in
order
to
show
me
the
old
house
i
said
i
be
there
at
ten
and
could
then
get
back
to
you
in
time
for
lunch
i
do
trust
you
do
mind
of
course
we
do
said
molly
in
a
hearty
tone
now
mags
but
if
you
think
maggie
said
isabel
that
you
will
succeed
in
that
scheme
of
yours
you
will
find
yourself
vastly
mistaken
maggie
smiled
gently
and
the
next
moment
she
found
herself
alone
she
went
and
stood
by
the
open
window
there
was
a
glorious
full
moon
in
the
sky
and
the
garden
with
its
deep
shadows
and
brilliant
avenues
of
light
looked
lovely
but
maggie
was
not
thinking
of
the
scenery
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
those
ideas
which
were
always
running
riot
in
her
busy
little
head
she
was
not
unamiable
she
was
in
reality
a
girl
but
she
was
very
ambitious
and
she
sighed
above
all
things
for
power
and
popularity
when
she
came
to
visit
molly
and
isabel
she
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
inducing
cicely
and
merry
to
join
that
select
group
who
were
taught
by
ward
at
aylmer
house
but
when
once
the
idea
had
entered
her
brain
she
determined
with
her
accustomed
quickness
to
carry
it
into
execution
she
had
never
yet
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
met
with
defeat
at
the
various
schools
where
she
had
been
taught
she
had
always
been
popular
and
had
won
friends
and
never
created
an
at
aylmer
house
extraordinary
and
delightful
as
the
life
was
there
was
one
girl
who
excited
her
enmity
who
in
short
roused
the
worst
that
was
in
her
that
girl
name
was
aneta
lysle
no
sophistries
on
the
part
of
maggie
no
clever
speeches
no
and
courteous
acts
could
win
the
approval
of
aneta
and
just
because
she
was
impossible
to
get
at
because
she
carried
her
young
head
high
because
she
had
that
which
maggie
could
never
have
a
stately
and
wonderful
beauty
maggie
was
jealous
of
her
and
was
determined
if
she
could
not
win
aneta
over
to
be
her
friend
to
use
her
own
considerable
powers
against
the
girl
she
had
not
for
a
single
moment
however
thought
that
she
could
be
helped
by
cicely
and
merry
in
this
direction
and
had
intended
to
get
them
to
come
to
the
school
simply
because
they
were
aristocratic
and
rich
in
the
first
instance
but
when
she
saw
lady
lysle
lady
lysle
who
hated
her
mother
and
before
whom
her
mother
trembled
and
shrank
lady
lysle
who
was
aunt
she
knew
that
cicely
and
merry
might
be
most
valuable
aids
to
her
in
carrying
out
her
campaign
against
aneta
and
would
help
her
to
establish
herself
once
and
for
all
as
the
most
powerful
and
important
person
in
ward
school
power
was
everything
to
maggie
by
power
she
meant
to
rule
her
small
and
eventually
by
the
aid
of
that
same
gift
to
take
her
position
in
the
greater
world
that
lies
beyond
school
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
considered
cicely
and
merry
tiresome
silly
ignorant
little
girls
but
they
could
be
made
to
play
into
her
hands
they
must
come
to
aylmer
house
oh
yes
and
already
she
felt
certain
she
had
put
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
beneath
that
opposition
which
she
knew
she
must
expect
from
cardew
she
would
see
him
again
on
the
morrow
indeed
greater
schemes
than
hers
could
be
carried
into
effect
within
a
fortnight
maggie
was
the
soul
of
however
and
had
no
idea
of
wearing
herself
out
thinking
when
she
ought
to
be
asleep
she
accordingly
soon
turned
from
the
window
and
getting
into
bed
dropped
at
once
into
healthy
slumber
when
she
awoke
she
felt
remarkably
and
cheerful
she
got
up
early
and
went
with
andrew
and
jack
to
see
the
adorable
rabbits
so
judicious
was
she
on
this
occasion
that
both
boys
returned
with
her
to
breakfast
in
the
highest
mother
mother
cried
jackdaw
she
loves
fanciful
because
he
so
beautiful
and
she
adores
because
he
so
ugly
said
peterkins
the
boys
were
exceedingly
happy
at
being
allowed
to
sit
at
breakfast
one
on
each
side
of
maggie
who
when
she
did
not
speak
to
them
for
she
wanted
to
ingratiate
herself
with
every
one
present
and
not
with
them
alone
contrived
to
pat
their
hands
from
time
to
time
and
so
keep
them
in
a
subdued
state
of
exceeding
soon
after
breakfast
she
flew
up
to
her
room
put
on
that
strangely
becoming
brown
hat
which
would
have
suited
no
other
girl
but
herself
and
went
off
to
the
manor
she
was
met
at
the
gate
by
merry
who
was
anxiously
waiting
for
her
appearance
i
am
so
sorry
that
cicely
is
here
too
said
merry
but
mother
wanted
cicely
to
drive
into
warwick
with
her
this
morning
going
for
a
long
this
afternoon
do
you
love
motors
i
have
never
been
in
one
in
my
life
replied
maggie
oh
dear
said
merry
then
you
shall
come
with
us
although
i
know
i
ca
ask
you
but
perhaps
we
could
manage
i
must
not
be
too
much
away
from
molly
and
isabel
for
it
would
not
be
kind
would
it
miss
cardew
do
call
me
merry
cardew
sounds
so
stiff
and
you
know
i
feel
that
i
have
known
you
all
my
life
for
molly
and
isabel
have
always
been
talking
about
you
mother
was
so
pleased
when
she
heard
that
you
wanted
to
see
the
old
house
and
do
you
know
maggie
you
mind
my
saying
maggie
of
course

you
believe
it
father
is
going
to
show
you
the
himself
i
can
tell
you
that
is
an
honor
i
am
so
delighted
said
maggie
your
father
is
a
most
charming
man
indeed
that
he
is
said
merry
but
i
never
saw
him
get
on
so
well
with
a
young
girl
before
oh
said
maggie
in
her
modest
way
it
was
just
that
i
wanted
to
listen
to
him
what
he
said
was
so
very
interesting
the
girls
were
now
walking
up
the
avenue
please
said
merry
suddenly
tell
me
more
about
your
school
i
mean
that
new
wonderful
school
you
are
at
in
london

house
said
maggie
yes

mother
was
talking
about
it
this
morning
she
was
quite
interested
in
it
your
mother
was
talking
about
it
yes
it
seems
tristram
had
been
praising
it
to
her
like
anything
last
night
well
he
ca
say
too
much
in
its
favor
said
maggie
any
girl
who
did
get
good
from
it
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
what
is
that
you
are
saying
miss
howland
said
the
voice
of
cardew
at
that
moment
oh
father
i
never
saw
you
cried
merry
cardew
came
up
and
shook
hands
with
maggie
i
was
walking
just
behind
you
on
the
grass
he
said
and
i
heard
your
enthusiastic
remarks
with
regard
to
the
school
that
the
young
tristrams
are
going
to
i
am
heartily
pleased
i
take
a
great
interest
in
the
tristrams
oh
sir
said
maggie
suddenly
i
only
wish
oh
i
hardly
dare
to
say
it
but
i
only
do
wish
that
your
girls
were
coming
too
merry
turned
crimson
and
then
grew
pale
father
does
approve
of
schools
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
as
a
rule
i
do
not
said
cardew
decidedly
but
of
course
i
am
bound
to
say
there
are
schools
and
schools
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
your
school
presently
miss
howland
and
now
i
will
allow
my
daughter
to
entertain
you
but
father
darling

promised
to
show
maggie
the

interested
in
said
cardew
i
am
interested
in
everything
old
replied
maggie
well
then
i
will
show
you
the
with
pleasure
but
if
you
want
to
go
over
the
manor
you
have
a
heavy
morning
work
before
you
and
merry
is
an
excellent
guide
however
let
me
see
i
will
meet
you
in
the
library
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
until
then
adieu
chapter
what
did
you
talk
about
maggie
and
merry
had
now
reached
the
great
porch
which
overshadowed
the
entrance
to
the
old
house
the
next
instant
they
found
themselves
in
the
hall
this
supported
by
graceful
pillars
was
open
up
to
the
roof
of
the
house
it
was
a
magnificent
hall
and
merry
began
enthusiastically
to
explain
its
perfections
maggie
showed
not
a
pretended
but
a
real
interest
she
asked
innumerable
and
sensible
questions
her
queer
calm
narrow
eyes
grew
very
bright
she
smiled
now
and
then
and
her
face
seemed
the
personification
of
intelligence
with
that
smile
and
those
gleaming
white
teeth
who
could
have
thought
of
maggie
howland
as
plain
they
went
from
the
hall
into
the
older
part
of
the
house
and
there
merry
continued
her
duties
as
guide
never
before
had
she
been
in
the
company
of
so
absolutely
charming
a
companion
maggie
was
the
best
listener
in
the
world
she
never
interrupted
with
tiresome
or
irrelevant
questions
when
she
did
speak
it
was
with
the
utmost
intelligence
showing
clearly
that
she
understood
what
she
was
being
told
they
found
themselves
in
the
there
merry
insisted
on
their
sitting
down
for
a
time
and
taking
a
rest
she
touched
a
bell
as
she
spoke
and
then
motioned
maggie
to
recline
in
a
deep
which
faced
the
picture
of
a
beautiful
lady
who
was
the
grandmother
of
the
present
cardew
that
lady
name
said
merry
was
cicely
meredith
and
she
was
the
wife
of
the
last
meredith
but
one
who
owned
the
manor
it
was
little
supposed
in
those
days
that
my
darling
mother
would
inherit
the
place
and
that
cardews
should
live
at
meredith
manor
after
all
ah
here
comes
dixon
dixon
will
you
put
our
lunch
on
that
small
table
thank
you
very
much
one
of
the
servants
in
the
cardew
livery
had
appeared
he
was
bearing
a
small
tray
of
tempting
drinks
fruit
and
cake
now
maggie
eat
do
eat
said
merry
i
declare
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
said
maggie
and
she
munched
cake
and
ate
fruit
and
felt
that
she
was
as
she
expressed
it
to
herself
although
she
would
not
have
used
the
words
aloud
in
clover
nevertheless
she
was
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
that
mission
which
she
had
set
herself
she
turned
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
merry
merry
had
a
pretty
profile
with
the
short
and
the
graceful
appearance
of
a
very
girl
do
you
said
maggie
after
a
pause
happen
to
know
aneta
lysle
why
of
course
said
merry
do
you
mean
lady
lysle
niece
yes
replied
maggie
i
do
know
her
well
but
she
has
stayed
here
once
or
twice
is
she
a
friend
of
yours
maggie
oh
no
scarcely
a
friend
although
we
are
schoolfellows
how
stupid
of
me
said
merry
speaking
with
some
warmth
of
course
i
quite
forgot
that
she
is
at
ward
school
she
is
older
than
you
is
she
maggie
yes
a
year
older
as
days
are
counted
but
she
appears
even
more
than
her
age
which
is
just
seventeen
do
you
think
her
very
beautiful
merry
now
that
i
recall
her
i
do
but
she
never
made
a
special
impression
on
me
she
never
stayed
here
long
enough
nevertheless
she
is
a
sort
of
cousin
of
yours
yes
lady
lysle
is
mother
cousin
but
then
one
does
love
all
one
relations
said
merry
carelessly
have
another
piece
of
cake
maggie
thanks
said
maggie
helping
herself
how
delicious
it
is
and
put
some
more
cream
over
your
raspberries
the
raspberries
at
meredith
manor
are
celebrated
maggie
helped
herself
to
some
more
cream
i
do
wish
she
said
suddenly
that
i
would
go
on
telling
you
about
the
pictures
said
merry
but
you
must
be
tired
i
never
knew
any
one
take
in
interesting
things
so
quickly
i
am
glad
you
think
i
do
but
it
so
happens
that
i
do
not
want
to
hear
about
the
pictures
this
morning
i
think
perhaps
i
am
after
all
a
bit
tired
it
is
the
pleasure
the
delight
of
knowing
you
and
your
sister
and
of
being
with
those
sweet
girls
molly
and
isabel
yes
are
they
darlings
said
merry
i
want
you
to
tell
me
a
lot
about
yourself
said
maggie
we
have
yet
before
i
am
to
meet
your
father
in
the
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
just
everything
you
are
not
schoolgirls
oh
no
said
merry
speaking
slowly
we
are
taught
at
home
but
have
you
a
resident
governess
no
father
objects
this
is
of
course
but
as
a
rule
we
have
a
daily
governess
and
masters
it
must
be
dull
said
maggie
speaking
in
a
low
tone
so
low
that
merry
had
to
strain
her
ears
to
hear
it
she
replied
at
once
is
nearly
so
interesting
as
school
but
we
we
are
quite
satisfied
i
wonder
you
do
go
to
school
said
maggie
father
does
wish
it
maggie
but
you
like
it
would
you
like
it
said
merry
her
eyes
distended
a
little
like
to
see
the
world
and
to
know
other
girls
well
yes
i
should
like
it
there
be
discipline
you
know
said
maggie
it
would
be
all
fun
of
course
not
said
merry
how
could
one
expect
education
to
be
all
fun
and
you
would
naturally
like
to
be
very
well
educated
would
you
said
maggie
certainly
but
i
suppose
we
are
that
is
after
a
fashion
yes
said
maggie
after
a
fashion
doubtless
but
you
will
go
into
society
and
you
find
well
that
home
education
leaves
out
a
great
many
points
of
knowledge
which
can
not
possibly
be
attained
except
by
mixing
with
other
girls
i
suppose
so
said
merry
speaking
with
a
slight
degree
of
impatience
but
then
cicely
and
i
ca
help
it
we
have
to
do
what
father
and
mother
wish
yes
exactly
merry
and
it
so
awfully
sweet
and
amiable
of
you
now
may
i
describe
to
you
a
little
bit
of
if
you
like
maggie
molly
and
isabel
have
often
told
me
of
what
you
did
in
hanover
oh
hanover
said
maggie
with
a
tone
of
slight
contempt
we
think
of
hanover
now
in
our
ideas
of
we
had
a
fairly
good
time
for
a
german
school
but
to
compare
it
with
ward
house
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
dream
of
a
life
i
have
lived
during
the
last
term
it
is
only
to
see
ward
to
love
her
and
all
the
other
mistresses
are
so
nice
and
the
girls
are
so
very
select
and
then
we
take
a
keen
interest
in
our
lessons
you
the
musical
one
are
you
merry
yes
how
ever
did
you
find
that
out
well
said
maggie
i
looked
at
you
and
i
guessed
it
besides
i
heard
you
hum
an
air
under
your
breath
yesterday
and
i
knew
at
once
that
you
had
a
lovely
voice
i
am
sure
i
have
and
i
too
young
to
begin
not
a
bit
of
it
that
quite
an
exploded
idea
if
for
instance
oh
of
course
i
know
you
wo
be
there
but
if
you
were
so
lucky
as
to
be
a
pupil
at
ward
you
would
be
taught
to
sing
and
what
is
more
valuable
you
would
hear
good
wonderful
beautiful
singing
and
wonderful
beautiful
music
of
all
sorts
once
a
week
we
all
go
to
a
concert
at
queen
hall
have
you
ever
been
there
no
i
do
know
london
at
all
well
then
another
day
in
the
week
continued
maggie
we
go
to
the
different
museums
and
and
we
get
accustomed
to
good
art
and
we
are
taught
to
discern
good
from
bad
we
learn
architecture
at
paul
and
the
abbey
and
some
of
the
other
churches
you
see
ward
idea
is
to
teach
us
everything
and
during
the
summer
term
she
takes
us
on
long
expeditions
up
the
river
to
kew
and
hampton
court
and
all
those
dear
old
places
then
in
addition
she
has
what
she
calls
reunions
in
the
evenings
we
all
wear
and
she
invites
two
or
three
friends
and
we
sing
and
play
among
ourselves
and
we
are
taught
the
little
observances
essential
to
good
society
and
besides
all
the
things
that
ward
does
we
have
our
own
private
club
and
our
own
debating
society
and
oh
it
is
a
full
life
and
it
teaches
one
it
helps
one
merry
soft
brown
eyes
were
very
bright
and
her
cheeks
had
a
carnation
glow
on
them
and
her
pretty
red
lips
were
slightly
parted
you
do
all
these
things
at
school
at
school
she
said
why
of
course
and
many
many
more
things
that
you
ca
even
imagine
for
it
the
whole
influence
of
the
place
that
is
so
delightful
then
you
make
friends
great
friends
and
you
get
to
understand
character
and
you
get
to
understand
the
value
of
real
discipline
and
you
are
taught
also
that
you
are
not
meant
to
live
a
worldly
and
selfish
life
for
ward
is
very
philanthropic
each
girl
in
her
school
has
to
help
a
poor
girl
in
east
london
and
the
poor
girl
becomes
in
a
sort
of
manner
her
property
i
have
got
a
dear
little
lame
girl
her
name
is
susie
style
i
am
allowed
to
see
her
once
or
twice
a
year
and
i
write
her
a
letter
every
week
and
she
writes
back
to
me
and
i
collect
enough
money
to
keep
her
in
a
cripples
home
i
have
enough
of
my
own
for
i
am
perhaps
the
poorest
girl
in
the
school
but
that
makes
no
difference
for
ward
does
allow
the
word
money
or
rank
to
be
spoken
of
she
lives
above
all
that
she
says
that
money
is
a
great
talent
and
that
people
who
are
merely
are
detestable
oh
but
i
told
you
enough
have
i
yes
oh
yes
said
merry
thanks
very
very
much
and
so
aneta
is
there
and
as
molly
and
isabel
will
be
there
they
will
tell
me
more
at
christmas
perhaps
we
ought
to
go
down
now
to
meet
father
in
the
maggie
rose
with
alacrity
she
followed
her
companion
quite
cheerfully
she
felt
assured
within
herself
that
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
had
been
well
inserted
by
now
cardew
was
exceedingly
courteous
and
pleasant
and
maggie
charmed
him
by
her
intelligence
and
her
marvellous
gift
of
assimilating
knowledge
not
a
word
was
said
with
regard
to
the
london
school
and
at
ten
minutes
to
one
maggie
bade
to
cardew
and
merry
and
went
back
to
the
rectory
in
considerable
spirits
molly
and
isabel
were
all
impatience
for
her
return
well
what
did
you
do
said
molly
who
was
there
to
meet
you
only
merry
cicely
had
gone
with
cardew
to
warwick
oh
well
merry
is
the
jollier
of
the
two
although
they
are
both
perfectly
sweet
said
molly
and
did
she
show
you
all
the
house
maggie
no
said
maggie
i
really
could
take
it
all
in
but
she
took
me
round
the
armory
and
into
the
old
tower
and
then
we
went
into
the
oh
she
took
you
into
the
there
are
romneys
and
gainsboroughs
and
sir
joshua
reynoldses
and
all
sorts
of
magnificent
treasures
there
doubtless
said
maggie
but
when
i
tell
you
what
we
did
you
will
laugh
what
did
you
do
do
tell
us
mags
we
sat
in
i
faced
the
portrait
of
a
very
beautiful
lady
after
whom
cicely
cardew
is
called
of
course
i
know
her
well
i
mean
her
picture
said
isabel
that
is
a
gainsborough
did
you
admire
it
yes
but
i
want
to
look
at
it
again
i
going
to
do
the
gallery
another
day
and
on
that
occasion
i
think
i
shall
ask
cicely
to
accompany
me
why
what
do
you
mean
do
you
like
our
sweet
little
merry
like
her
i
quite
love
her
said
maggie
but
the
fact
is
girls
i
did
my
duty
by
her
this
morning
and
now
i
want
to
do
my
duty
by
cicely
oh
mags
you
are
so
mysterious
said
molly
but
come
upstairs
and
take
off
your
hat
for
the
gong
will
sound
for
lunch
in
a
moment
maggie
went
upstairs
molly
and
isabel
following
her
come
into
my
room
girls
she
said
then
she
added
dropping
her
voice
i
think
those
bracelets
are
pretty
secure
molly
colored
isabel
looked
down
you
will
never
succeed
said
molly
then
isabel
said
even
if
you
do
i
do
think
we
ought
perhaps
to
to
take
them
for
it
would
seem
as
though
they
were
a
sort
of
sort
of
bribe
oh
you
old
goose
said
maggie
kissing
her
how
could
they
be
a
bribe
when
i
do
ask
you
to
do
anything
at
all
but
now
listen
we
were
tired
when
we
got
to
the
gallery
therefore
that
sweet
little
merry
of
yours
ordered
fruit
and
milk
and
cake
and
we
ate
and
talked
what
did
you
talk
about
school
dear
what
was
the
good
of
your
talking
about
school
to
merry
when
she
ca
go
ca
go
said
maggie
why
she
is
going
only
it
was
my
bounden
duty
to
make
her
want
to
go
well
i
succeeded
in
doing
that
this
morning
there
the
gong
and
notwithstanding
my
lunch
i
am
quite
hungry
well
andrew
and
jack
are
perfectly
mad
to
see
you
you
have
to
devote
a
bit
of
your
time
to
them
dear
me
mags
said
molly
it
must
be
tiresome
to
be
a
sort
of
universal
favorite
as
you
are
tiresome
said
maggie
glancing
round
with
her
queer
expressive
eyes
when
i
love
it
like
anything
let
get
up
a
sort
of
play
between
ourselves
this
afternoon
and
let
the
boys
join
in
and
oh
could
we
do
you
think
we
might
get
your
two
friends
cicely
and
merry
to
join
us
just
for
an
impromptu
thing
that
we
could
act
beautifully
in
the
would
their
father
consent
why
of
course
he
would
i
run
round
the
minute
lunch
is
over
and
get
them
said
isabel
you
are
a
girl
for
planning
things
mags
it
be
quite
glorious
we
might
have
tea
in
the
too
continued
maggie
i
am
sure
peterkins
and
jackdaw
will
help
us
capital
capital
and
we
get
david
david
was
the
boy
to
pick
lots
of
fruit
for
the
occasion
chapter
vi
forbidden
fruit
meanwhile
a
little
girl
stood
all
alone
on
one
of
the
terrace
walks
at
meredith
manor
cardew
and
cicely
would
not
arrive
until
rather
late
for
lunch
and
merry
and
her
father
were
to
partake
of
it
alone
merry
paced
up
and
down
very
slowly
what
a
lovely
day
it
was
and
how
beautiful
the
place
looked
with
its
long
lines
of
stately
trees
and
its
background
of
woods
and
its
terraces
of
bright
flowers
and
green
green
grass
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
land
belonged
to
the
cardews
and
yet
merry
cardew
the
with
cicely
of
all
this
wealth
did
not
feel
either
happy
or
contented
at
that
moment
a
girl
had
come
into
her
life
who
had
suddenly
turned
her
gold
to
gray
her
sunshine
to
shadow
she
was
a
very
nice
girl
too
exceedingly
nice
there
was
something
about
her
which
merry
found
impossible
to
define
for
merry
had
no
acquaintances
just
then
in
her
sheltered
life
who
possessed
the
and
marvelous
power
of
charm
merry
knew
quite
well
that
maggie
howland
was
neither
rich
nor
beautiful
she
was
just
a
little
schoolgirl
and
yet
she
could
not
get
maggie
out
of
her
head
she
sighed
for
the
girl
companionship
and
she
sighed
yet
more
for
the
forbidden
fruit
which
maggie
had
placed
so
enticingly
before
her
mental
vision
the
the
good
life
the
energetic
purposeful
life
music
oh
how
passionately
merry
loved
the
very
little
music
she
had
ever
heard
and
art
merry
and
cicely
had
learned
a
little
bit
of
art
in
their
own
but
of
all
there
was
outside
they
knew
nothing
then
that
delightful
wonderful
scheme
of
having
an
east
end
girl
for
your
very
own
to
train
and
help
and
write
to
and
support
and
the
companionship
and
all
the
magical
things
which
the
tristrams
had
more
or
less
enjoyed
in
foreign
schools
but
which
seemed
to
have
reached
a
delicacy
of
perfection
at
aylmer
house
yes
doubtless
these
were
forbidden
fruits
but
she
could
not
help
as
she
paced
alone
on
the
terrace
contrasting
her
mode
of
education
with
that
which
was
put
within
the
reach
of
her
friends
molly
and
isabel
and
of
maggie
herself
how
dull
after
all
were
her
lessons
the
daily
governess
who
was
always
tired
when
she
arrived
taught
her
out
of
books
which
even
molly
and
isabel
declared
to
be
out
of
date
who
yawned
a
good
deal
who
was
always
quite
quite
kind
but
at
the
same
time
had
no
enthusiasm
who
said
yes
my
dears
very
nicely
done
but
never
even
punished
and
who
only
uttered
just
that
mild
phrase
which
was
monotonous
by
reason
of
its
repetition
where
was
the
good
of
reading
racine
aloud
to
miss
beverley
day
after
day
and
not
being
able
to
talk
french
properly
at
all
and
where
was
the
use
of
struggling
through
german
with
the
same
instructress
then
the
who
came
from
warwick
he
was
better
than
miss
beverley
but
after
all
he
taught
what
molly
and
isabel
said
was
now
quite
exploded
namely
freehand
and
he
only
came
once
a
week
merry
passion
was
for
music
more
than
for
drawing
it
was
cicely
who
pleased
vaughan
the
best
then
there
was
the
bennett
but
he
never
would
allow
her
to
sing
a
note
and
he
taught
very
dull
pieces
how
sick
she
was
of
pieces
and
of
playing
them
religiously
before
her
father
at
least
once
a
week
her
dancing
was
better
for
she
had
to
go
to
warwick
to
a
and
there
were
other
girls
and
they
made
it
exciting
but
compared
to
school
and
in
especial
ward
school
mode
of
instruction
was
very
dull
after
all
molly
and
isabel
although
they
would
be
quite
poor
girls
had
a
better
time
than
she
and
cicely
with
all
their
wealth
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
my
love
said
her
father
at
that
moment
and
merry
turned
her
charming
little
face
towards
him
i
ought
not
to
tell
them
to
you
dad
she
said
for
they
are
ever
so
sorry
they
are
discontented
thoughts
you
discontented
my
dear
child
i
did
feel
that
i
had
two
little
girls
unacquainted
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
well
i
just
tell
you
and
get
it
over
dad
i
be
perfectly
all
right
once
i
have
told
you
then
talk
away
my
child
you
know
i
have
your
very
best
interests
at
heart
indeed
i
know
that
my
darling
father
the
fact
is
this
said
merry
i
she
stopped
she
glanced
at
her
father
he
was
a
most
determined
and
yet
a
most
absolutely
kind
man
merry
adored
him
nevertheless
she
was
a
tiny
little
bit
in
awe
of
him
what
is
the
matter
he
said
looking
round
at
her
has
your
companion
that
nice
little
miss
howland
been
putting
silly
thoughts
into
your
head
if
so
she
must
come
here
again
oh
father
do
say
that
you
make
me
quite
miserable
and
indeed
she
has
not
been
putting
silly
thoughts
into
my
head
well
then
what
are
you
so
melancholy
about
the
fact
is
there
i
will
have
it
out
said
merry
i
give
anything
in
the
world
to
go
to
school
what
said
cardew
yes
said
merry
gaining
courage
as
she
spoke
molly
and
isabel
are
going
and
aneta
lysle
is
there
and
maggie
howland
is
there
and
like
to
go
too
and
i
sure
cicely
would
and
oh
father
i
know
it
be
but
you
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
well
that
the
matter
i
do
want
most
awfully
to
go
to
school
has
that
girl
miss
howland
been
telling
you
that
you
ought
to
go
to
school
indeed
no
she
has
not
breathed
such
a
word
but
i
am
always
interested
as
you
know
or
as
perhaps
you
do
know
in
schools
and
i
have
always
asked
and
so
has
cicely
molly
and
isabel
to
tell
us
all
about
their
lives
at
school
i
did
not
know
it
my
little
merry
well
yes
father
cicely
and
i
have
been
curious
for
you
see
the
life
is
so
very
different
from
ours
and
so
when
maggie
and
i
were
in
the
i
asked
her
to
tell
me
about
aylmer
house
and
she
she
did
she
made
a
glowing
picture
evidently
said
cardew
oh
father
it
must
be
so
lovely
think
of
it
father
to
get
the
best
music
and
the
best
art
and
to
be
under
the
influence
of
a
woman
like
ward
oh
it
must
be
good
do
you
know
father
that
every
girl
in
her
school
has
an
east
end
girl
to
look
after
and
help
so
that
some
of
the
riches
of
the
west
should
be
felt
and
appreciated
by
those
who
live
in
the
east
oh
father
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
jealous
yes
darling
i
quite
understand
and
you
find
your
life
with
miss
beverley
and
vaughan
and
bennett
a
little
monotonous
compared
to
the
variety
which
a
affords
that
is
it
father
darling
i
do
blame
you
in
the
least
merry
not
in
the
very
least
but
the
fact
is
i
have
my
own
reasons
for
not
approving
of
i
prefer
girls
who
are
trained
at
home
if
indeed
you
had
to
earn
your
living
it
would
be
a
different
matter
but
you
will
be
rich
dear
some
day
and
well
i
am
glad
you
spoken
to
me
do
think
anything
more
about
it
come
in
to
lunch
now
i
try
not
to
think
of
it
father
and
you
not
really
angry
angry
said
gardew
i
never
be
angry
with
you
merry
when
you
tell
me
all
the
thoughts
of
your
heart
and
you
wo
you
wo
said
merry
in
an
anxious
tone
vex
darling
mother
by
talking
to
her
about
this
i
make
no
promises
whatsoever
you
have
trusted
me
you
must
continue
to
trust
me
i
do
indeed
i
do
you
are
not
angry
with
dear
nice
miss
howland
are
you
father
angry
with
her
why
should
i
be
most
certainly
not
now
come
in
to
lunch
love
at
that
meal
cardew
did
his
very
utmost
to
be
pleasant
to
merry
and
as
there
could
be
no
man
more
charming
when
he
pleased
soon
the
little
girl
was
completely
under
his
influence
and
forgot
that
fascinating
picture
of
which
maggie
had
so
delicately
painted
for
her
edification
soon
after
lunch
cardew
and
cicely
returned
and
merry
the
moment
she
was
with
her
sister
felt
her
sudden
fit
of
the
blues
departing
and
ran
out
gaily
with
cicely
into
the
garden
they
were
seated
comfortably
in
a
little
arbor
when
isabel
voice
was
heard
calling
them
she
was
hot
and
panting
she
had
come
up
to
tell
them
of
the
proposed
arrangements
for
the
afternoon
and
to
beg
of
them
both
to
come
immediately
to
the
rectory
how
more
than
delightful
said
cicely
you
stay
still
for
you
a
little
tired
i
run
up
to
the
house
at
once
and
ask
father
and
mother
if
we
may
go
yes
please
do
said
isabel
and
i
rest
here
for
a
little
for
really
the
walk
up
to
your
house
is
somewhat
fatiguing
she
mopped
her
hot
forehead
as
she
spoke
you
might
as
well
come
back
with
me
both
of
you
girls
she
added
but
she
only
spoke
to
cicely
for
merry
had
already
vanished
father
mother
said
the
young
girl
bursting
abruptly
into
their
presence
belle
tristram
has
just
come
up
to
ask
us
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
the
rectory
tea
in
the
and
all
kinds
of
fun
may
we
go
of
course
you
may
dears
said
cardew
at
once
we
intended
motoring
but
we
can
do
that
another
day
cardew
looked
dubious
for
a
moment
then
he
said
all
right
only
you
must
not
be
out
too
late
i
send
the
down
to
the
rectory
for
you
at
eight
oh
but
father
said
merry
we
can
walk
home
no
dear
i
will
send
the
little
carriage
now
go
and
enjoy
yourself
my
child
he
looked
at
her
with
great
affection
and
she
felt
herself
reddening
had
she
hurt
that
most
dear
father
after
all
oh
no
school
that
ever
existed
was
worth
that
chapter
vii
discontent
on
that
special
afternoon
and
cardew
happened
to
be
alone
the
girls
had
gone
down
to
the
rectory
this
was
not
cardew
at
home
day
and
she
therefore
did
not
expect
any
visitors
she
was
a
little
tired
after
her
long
drive
to
warwick
and
was
glad
when
her
husband
suggested
that
they
should
go
out
and
have
tea
all
alone
together
under
one
of
the
cardew
said
to
herself
that
this
was
almost
like
the
old
old
times
of
very
long
ago
she
and
her
husband
had
enjoyed
an
almost
ideal
married
life
they
had
never
quarreled
they
had
never
even
had
a
small
disagreement
they
were
blessed
abundantly
with
this
good
things
for
when
sylvia
meredith
of
meredith
manor
had
accepted
the
hand
of
cyril
cardew
she
had
also
given
her
heart
to
him
he
and
she
were
one
in
all
particulars
their
thoughts
were
almost
identical
she
was
by
no
means
a
woman
she
had
plenty
of
character
and
firmness
but
she
deferred
to
the
wishes
of
her
husband
as
a
good
wife
should
and
was
glad
to
feel
that
he
was
slightly
her
master
never
under
any
circumstances
did
he
make
her
feel
the
yoke
nevertheless
she
obeyed
him
and
delighted
in
doing
so
the
arrival
of
their
little
was
the
crown
of
their
bliss
they
never
regretted
the
fact
that
no
son
was
born
to
them
to
inherit
the
stately
acres
of
meredith
manor
they
were
the
last
sort
of
people
to
grumble
cardew
inherited
the
meredith
property
in
her
own
right
and
eventually
it
would
be
divided
between
her
two
daughters
meanwhile
the
children
themselves
absorbed
the
most
loving
care
of
their
parents
cardew
was
as
has
already
been
said
a
great
he
often
went
to
london
to
attend
to
his
business
affairs
but
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
exquisite
country
home
it
was
quite
true
that
discontent
seemed
far
very
far
away
from
so
lovely
a
spot
as
meredith
manor
nevertheless
cardew
had
seen
it
on
the
face
of
his
child
his
little
merry
the
look
had
hurt
him
and
while
he
was
having
lunch
with
her
and
joking
with
her
and
talking
in
his
usually
bright
and
intelligent
way
her
words
and
still
more
the
expression
of
her
face
and
the
longing
look
in
her
sweet
brown
eyes
returned
to
him
again
and
again
he
was
therefore
more
thoughtful
than
usual
as
he
sat
by
his
side
now
under
the
he
had
a
pile
of
newspapers
and
magazines
on
the
grass
at
his
feet
and
his
favorite
jim
lay
close
to
his
master
cardew
had
her
invariable
knitting
and
a
couple
of
novels
waiting
to
occupy
her
attention
when
cardew
took
up
one
of
the
newspapers
but
for
a
time
the
pair
were
silent
cardew
was
thinking
of
something
which
she
wanted
to
say
and
cardew
was
thinking
of
merry
it
was
as
is
invariably
the
case
the
woman
who
first
broke
the
silence
well
cyril
said
his
wife
to
find
ourselves
seated
here
all
alone
without
the
children
voices
to
listen
to
reminds
me
of
the
old
times
the
good
times
the
beautiful
times
when
we
were
first
married
my
dear
he
answered
starting
slightly
as
she
spoke
those
were
certainly
good
and
beautiful
times
but
surely
not
more
good
and
beautiful
than
now
when
our
two
dear
little
girls
are
growing
up
and
giving
us
such
great
happiness
that
is
true
please
do
misunderstand
me
love
but
you
come
even
before
the
children
he
felt
touched
as
she
said
this
and
glancing
at
her
said
to
himself
that
he
was
indeed
in
luck
to
have
secured
so
priceless
a
woman
as
his
wife
we
have
had
happy
times
together
cyril
she
said
returning
his
glance
yes
sylvia
he
answered
and
once
again
he
thought
of
face
nothing
can
alter
that
she
continued
nothing
my
love
he
said
then
he
looked
at
her
again
and
saw
that
she
was
a
little
troubled
about
something
and
as
was
his
custom
he
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
you
have
something
on
your
mind
sylvia
what
is
it
i
have
she
said
at
once
and
something
of
very
great
importance
i
have
a
sort
of
fear
that
to
talk
of
it
with
you
may
possibly
trouble
you
a
little
shall
we
defer
it
dear
the
day
is
so
peaceful
and
we
are
so
happy
no
no
he
replied
at
once
we
will
take
the
opportunity
of
the
children
being
perfectly
happy
at
the
rectory
to
discuss
the
thing
that
worries
you
but
what
can
it
be
he
continued
that
is
more
than
i
can
imagine
i
have
never
seen
you
worried
before
again
he
thought
of
merry
but
it
was
impossible
to
connect
his
trouble
with
his
child
discontent
well
i
will
tell
you
just
out
cyril
said
his
wife
i
urge
nothing
but
i
feel
bound
to
make
a
suggestion
i
know
your
views
with
regard
to
the
girls
my
views
dear
what
do
you
mean
with
regard
to
their
education
cyril
yes
yes
sylvia
we
have
done
our
very
best
have
you
any
reason
to
find
fault
with
miss
beverley
or
with
vaughan
or
bennett
unfortunately
said
cardew
miss
beverley
who
you
know
is
an
admirable
governess
and
whom
we
can
most
thoroughly
trust
wrote
to
me
yesterday
morning
saying
that
she
was
obliged
to
resign
her
post
as
daily
governess
to
our
girls
she
finds
the
distance
from
warwick
too
far
in
fact
she
has
her
physician
orders
to
take
work
nearer
home
she
regrets
it
immensely
but
feels
that
she
has
no
alternative
provoking
said
cardew
but
really
sylvia
i
would
allow
it
to
upset
me
if
i
were
you
surely
there
are
plenty
of
other
miss
beverleys
in
the
world
and
again
he
thought
of
merry
we
might
perhaps
find
some
one
a
little
less
i
am
afraid
dear
that
is
impossible
for
you
will
not
allow
a
resident
governess
in
the
house
i
will
not
said
cardew
with
decision
such
an
arrangement
would
break
in
on
our
family
life
you
know
my
views
yes
dear
and
i
must
say
i
approve
of
them
you
must
find
some
one
else
in
warwick
who
is
not
too
tired
to
take
the
train
journey
doubtless
it
would
be
quite
easy
said
cardew
i
went
to
warwick
this
morning
in
order
to
make
inquiries
said
cardew
in
her
gentle
voice
and
i
grieve
to
say
there
is
no
one
who
can
in
the
least
take
the
post
which
dear
miss
beverley
has
so
worthily
filled
but
i
have
further
bad
news
to
give
you
bennett
is
leaving
warwick
for
a
better
post
in
london
and
we
shall
be
at
our
wits
end
to
get
the
girls
good
for
next
term
how
provoking
how
annoying
said
cardew
and
his
irritation
was
plainly
shown
in
his
face
it
does
seem
hard
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
that
we
with
all
our
wealth
should
be
unable
to
give
our
girls
the
thorough
education
they
require
the
fact
is
this
dear
said
cardew
and
i
must
speak
out
plainly
even
at
the
risk
of
displeasing
you
cicely
and
merry
are
exceedingly
clever
girls
but
at
the
present
moment
they
are
very
far
behind
other
girls
of
their
age
their
knowledge
of
foreign
languages
is
most
deficient
i
have
no
doubt
miss
beverley
has
grounded
them
well
in
english
subjects
but
as
to
accomplishments
they
are
not
getting
the
advantages
their
rank
in
life
and
their
talent
demand
dear
cyril
we
ought
to
forget
ourselves
and
our
interests
for
the
children
what
has
put
all
this
into
your
head
said
cardew
as
for
instance
he
paused
it
seemed
impossible
what
dear
asked
his
wife
very
earnestly
well
i
may
as
well
say
it
has
merry
been
talking
to
you
our
little
merry
said
cardew
in
astonishment
of
course
not
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
i
will
not
explain
just
at
present
dear
you
have
some
idea
in
your
head
or
you
would
speak
to
me
as
you
do
well
the
fact
is
when
my
cousin
lucia
lysle
was
here
yesterday
she
spoke
very
strongly
to
me
on
the
subject
of
the
girls
education
and
urged
me
to
do
what
i
knew
you
would
never
for
a
moment
consent
to
and
what
is
that
asked
gardew
i
seem
to
be
an
awful
bugbear
in
this
business
no
dear
no
i
quite
understand
your
scruples
and
and
respect
them
but
lucia
naturally
wanted
us
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
two
vacancies
at
aylmer
house
ward
school
i
shall
soon
begin
to
hate
the
name
of
ward
said
cardew
with
some
asperity
my
cousin
spoke
most
highly
of
the
school
continued
cardew
she
said
that
two
years
there
or
perhaps
a
little
longer
would
give
the
girls
that
knowledge
of
life
which
will
be
to
them
in
the
future
home
education
is
best
i
know
it
is
best
said
cardew
i
hate
girls
schools
i
gave
her
to
understand
dear
that
those
were
your
views
but
i
have
something
else
to
tell
you
you
know
how
attached
we
both
are
to
the
dear
tristrams
of
course
of
course
said
cardew
with
impatience
well
at
supper
yesterday
evening
tristram
began
to
talk
to
me
on
the
very
same
subject
as
my
cousin
lady
lysle
had
spoken
of
earlier
in
the
day
very
interfering
of
tristram
replied
cardew
he
did
mean
it
in
that
way
i
assure
you
my
love
nothing
could
be
nicer
than
the
way
he
spoke
i
was
telling
him
for
i
had
not
mentioned
the
fact
to
you
and
it
was
troubling
me
a
little
about
miss
beverley
and
bennett
and
asking
his
advice
as
i
often
do
he
immediately
urged
aylmer
house
as
the
best
possible
substitute
for
miss
beverley
and
bennett
i
repeated
almost
the
same
words
i
had
used
to
lucia
lysle
namely
that
you
were
against
schools
that
was
scarcely
polite
my
love
seeing
that
he
sends
his
own
daughters
to
school
well
yes
said
cardew
but
of
course
their
circumstances
are
very
different
i
would
be
sorry
if
he
should
feel
that
difference
sylvia
tristram
is
a
most
excellent
fellow
he
is
indeed
he
is
said
cardew
feeling
for
him
therefore
as
you
do
dear
you
may
perhaps
be
more
inclined
to
listen
to
an
alternative
which
he
proposed
to
me
and
what
is
that
my
dear
well
he
thinks
we
might
occupy
our
house
in
london
during
the
school
terms
of
each
year
during
the
school
terms
of
each
year
echoed
cardew
in
a
voice
of
dismay
but
i
hate
living
in
london
yes
dearest
but
you
see
we
must
think
of
our
girls
if
you
and
i
took
the
children
to
town
they
could
have
governesses
and
masters
the
very
best
and
would
thus
be
sufficiently
educated
to
take
their
place
in
society
cardew
was
quite
silent
for
a
full
minute
after
his
wife
had
made
this
suggestion
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
done
a
somewhat
extraordinary
thing
amongst
this
great
lady
many
rich
possessions
was
a
splendid
mansion
in
grosvenor
street
but
as
she
hated
what
is
called
london
society
it
had
long
been
let
to
different
tenants
for
nothing
would
induce
the
cardews
to
leave
their
delightful
home
with
its
fresh
air
and
country
pursuits
for
the
dingy
old
house
in
town
they
knew
that
when
the
girls
came
out
a
date
as
yet
they
would
have
to
occupy
the
house
in
grosvenor
street
for
the
season
but
cardew
suggestion
that
they
should
go
there
almost
immediately
for
the
sake
of
their
daughters
education
was
more
annoying
to
her
husband
than
he
could
possibly
endure
i
consider
the
rector
very
officious
he
said
nothing
would
induce
me
to
live
in
town
i
thought
you
would
feel
like
that
dear
i
was
certain
of
it
you
surely
would
not
wish
it
yourself
sylvia
i
should
detest
it
beyond
words
she
replied
besides
the
house
is
occupied
said
cardew
catching
at
any
excuse
not
to
carry
out
this
abominable
plan
as
he
termed
it
well
dear
at
the
present
moment
it
is
not
i
had
a
letter
a
week
ago
from
our
agent
to
ask
if
he
should
relet
it
for
the
winter
and
next
season
and
i
have
not
yet
replied
to
him
nonsense
nonsense
sylvia
we
can
not
go
to
live
there
i
do
wish
it
my
love
the
pair
sat
quite
silent
after
cardew
had
made
this
last
remark
after
a
time
her
husband
said
we
really
placed
in
a
very
cruel
dilemma
but
doubtless
there
are
schools
and
schools
now
i
feel
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
i
ought
to
tell
you
about
merry
what
about
the
dear
child
asked
her
mother
is
she
well
absolutely
and
perfectly
well
but
our
dear
little
girl
is
consumed
by
the
fever
of
discontent
my
dear
you
must
be
mistaken
i
am
not
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
what
has
happened
cardew
then
related
his
brief
interview
with
merry
and
passionate
desire
to
go
to
aylmer
house
and
what
did
you
say
to
her
love
asked
his
wife
i
told
her
it
was
impossible
of
course
but
it
really
is
dear
you
know
said
cardew
in
a
low
tone
and
as
you
can
not
make
up
your
mind
to
live
in
london
those
two
vacancies
at
aylmer
house
seem
providential
at
these
words
cardew
sprang
to
his
feet
nothing
will
ever
shake
my
opinion
with
regard
to
he
said
and
yet
the
life
in
town
that
is
impossible
look
me
straight
in
the
face
sylvia
if
by
any
chance
do
please
imagine
that
i
giving
way
but
if
by
any
possible
chance
i
were
to
yield
could
you
my
darling
live
without
your
girls
with
you
i
could
she
answered
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
which
he
raised
to
his
lips
and
kissed
well
i
am
upset
he
said
if
only
miss
beverley
and
bennett
were
not
so
silly
we
should
not
be
in
this
awkward
fix
i
go
for
a
ride
if
you
do
mind
sylvia
and
be
back
with
you
in
an
time
during
that
ride
cardew
felt
as
a
strong
man
does
when
his
most
cherished
wishes
are
opposed
and
when
circumstance
with
its
overpowering
weight
bears
down
every
objection
beyond
doubt
the
girls
must
be
educated
beyond
doubt
the
scheme
of
living
in
london
could
not
be
entertained
country
life
was
essential
meredith
manor
must
not
be
deserted
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
he
might
visit
the
girls
whenever
he
went
to
london
but
after
all
he
was
now
more
or
less
a
sleeping
partner
in
his
great
firm
there
was
no
necessity
for
him
to
go
to
london
more
than
four
or
five
times
a
year
oh
school
was
hateful
but
little
merry
had
longed
for
it
how
troublesome
education
was
surely
the
girls
knew
enough
he
was
riding
home
his
thoughts
still
in
a
most
perturbed
condition
when
he
suddenly
drew
up
just
in
front
of
a
little
figure
who
stood
by
the
roadside
attired
as
a
gipsy
with
a
scarlet
bandana
handkerchief
twisted
round
her
head
a
short
skirt
reaching
not
quite
to
her
ankles
made
also
of
scarlet
and
a
little
gay
blue
shawl
across
her
shoulders
she
was
carrying
a
tambourine
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
great
bunch
of
ribbons
this
little
unexpected
figure
was
seen
close
to
the
rectory
grounds
and
cardew
was
so
startled
by
it
and
so
also
was
his
horse
that
he
drew
up
abruptly
and
looked
imperiously
at
the
small
suppliant
for
his
favor
if
you
please
sir
said
maggie
howland
speaking
in
her
most
enticing
voice
and
knowing
well
that
her
dress
magnified
her
charms
will
you
kind
sir
allow
me
to
cross
your
hand
with
silver
and
let
me
tell
your
fortune
cardew
now
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
why
miss
howland
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
recognize
you
maggie
dropped
a
low
curtsy
i
the
gipsy
girl
caranina
and
i
should
like
to
tell
your
fortune
kind
and
generous
sir
just
then
the
pretty
face
of
cicely
was
seen
peeping
over
the
rectory
grounds
she
was
dressed
as
a
and
looked
more
lovely
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
before
why
dad
dad
she
cried
oh
you
must
come
in
and
join
our
fun
must
he
maggie
i
am
caranina
the
gipsy
girl
said
maggie
dropping
another
low
curtsy
and
holding
her
little
tambourine
in
the
most
beseeching
attitude
and
you
are
flora
queen
of
the
flowers
well
really
this
is
entertaining
said
cardew
what
queer
little
minxes
you
all
are
and
may
i
really
come
in
and
see
the
fun
indeed
you
may
dad
said
the
oh
and
please
we
want
you
to
look
at
merry
merry
a
fairy
with
wings
we
going
to
have
what
we
call
an
evening
revel
presently
and
we
are
all
in
our
dress
for
the
occasion
but
maggie
i
mean
caranina
is
telling
our
fortunes
that
is
until
the
real
fun
begins
do
please
come
in
cardew
this
is
the
height
of
good
luck
said
tristram
coming
forward
herself
at
this
moment
wo
you
join
my
husband
and
me
under
the
shadow
of
the
tent
yonder
the
young
people
are
having
such
a
good
time
i
will
come
for
a
minute
or
two
said
cardew
dismounting
as
he
spoke
can
some
one
hold
hector
for
me
david
was
quickly
summoned
and
cardew
walked
across
the
to
where
the
hastily
improvised
tent
was
placed
no
one
can
enter
here
who
does
submit
to
the
will
of
the
gipsy
remarked
caranina
in
her
clear
and
beautiful
voice
this
is
my
tent
and
i
tell
the
fortunes
of
all
those
kind
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
will
permit
me
to
do
so
then
you
shall
tell
mine
with
pleasure
little
maid
said
cardew
who
felt
wonderfully
cheered
and
entertained
at
this
amusement
quick
as
thought
maggie
had
been
presented
with
a
silver
coin
with
this
she
crossed
the
good
gentleman
palm
and
murmured
a
few
words
with
regard
to
his
future
there
was
nothing
whatever
remarkable
in
her
utterance
for
maggie
knew
nothing
of
palmistry
and
was
only
a
very
pretense
gipsy
but
she
was
quick
quicker
than
most
in
reading
character
and
as
she
glanced
now
into
face
an
inspiration
seized
her
he
is
troubled
about
something
thought
the
girl
it
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
i
push
it
in
a
little
farther
her
voice
dropped
to
a
low
tone
i
see
in
your
hand
kind
sir
she
said
all
happiness
long
life
and
prosperity
but
i
also
see
a
little
cross
just
here
she
pointed
with
her
pretty
finger
and
it
means
for
the
sake
of
a
great
and
lasting
good
kind
sir
i
have
nothing
more
to
add
cardew
left
the
tent
and
sat
down
beside
the
rector
and
his
wife
maggie
words
were
really
unimportant
as
one
after
the
other
the
merry
group
of
actors
went
to
have
their
fortunes
told
he
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
them
gipsy
always
mixed
a
little
sorrow
with
their
joyful
tidings
it
was
a
bewitching
little
gipsy
after
all
he
could
not
quite
make
out
her
undefined
charm
but
he
was
interested
in
her
and
after
a
time
when
the
had
come
to
an
end
and
maggie
was
about
to
change
her
dress
for
what
they
called
the
evening
revels
he
crossed
the
field
and
stood
near
her
so
you
miss
howland
have
been
telling
my
daughter
merry
a
good
many
things
with
regard
to
your
new
school
she
raised
her
queer
bright
eyes
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
i
have
told
merry
a
few
things
she
said
but
most
of
all
i
have
assured
her
that
aylmer
house
is
the
happiest
place
in
the
world
happier
than
home
should
you
say
it
was
happier
than
home
miss
howland
happier
than
my
home
said
maggie
with
a
little
sigh
very
gentle
and
almost
imperceptible
in
her
voice
oh
i
love
it
she
continued
with
enthusiasm
for
it
helps
i
mean
the
life
there
helps
to
make
one
good
cardew
said
nothing
more
after
a
time
he
bade
his
friends
and
returned
to
meredith
manor
in
course
of
time
the
little
was
sent
down
to
the
rectory
for
the
cardew
girls
who
went
back
greatly
elated
how
delightful
their
evening
had
been
and
what
a
marvelous
girl
maggie
howland
was
why
she
even
manages
to
subdue
and
to
rule
those
really
tiresome
boys
said
cicely
yes
remarked
merry
she
is
like
no
one
else
you
have
quite
fallen
in
love
with
her
have
you
merry
well
perhaps
i
have
a
little
bit
said
merry
she
looked
thoughtful
she
longed
to
say
to
cicely
how
i
wish
beyond
all
things
on
earth
that
i
were
going
to
the
same
school
but
a
certain
fidelity
to
her
father
kept
her
silent
she
was
startled
therefore
when
cicely
herself
who
was
always
supposed
to
be
much
calmer
than
merry
and
less
vehement
in
her
desires
clasped
her
sister
hand
and
said
with
emphasis
i
know
after
all
if
it
is
good
for
us
to
see
too
much
of
maggie
howland
why
cissie
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
this
said
cicely
she
makes
me
yes
i
will
say
it
discontented
and
me
too
said
merry
uttering
the
words
with
an
emphasis
which
astonished
herself
we
have
talked
of
school
over
and
over
again
said
cicely
with
molly
and
belle
but
notwithstanding
their
glowing
accounts
we
have
been
quite
satisfied
with
miss
beverley
and
dear
bennett
and
vaughan
but
now
i
for
one
do
feel
satisfied
any
longer
nor
do
i
said
merry
oh
merry
it
is
true
said
merry
i
want
to
go
to
aylmer
house
and
i
am
almost
mad
to
go
there
said
cicely
i
tell
you
something
cissie
i
spoke
to
father
about
it
merry
you
did
dare
well
i
just
did
i
could
help
myself
it
is
hateful
to
be
and
you
know
we
shall
never
be
like
other
girls
if
we
do
see
something
of
the
world
he
did
by
any
chance
agree
with
you
said
cicely
not
a
bit
of
it
said
merry
we
must
bear
with
our
present
life
only
perhaps
we
ought
to
see
too
much
of
maggie
howland
well
said
cicely
i
something
to
tell
you
merry
what
that
you
do
know
just
at
present
why
mother
and
i
went
to
warwick
this
morning
no
said
merry
who
was
rather
uninterested
i
had
a
very
good
time
with
maggie
and
did
miss
you
too
dreadfully
well
you
will
be
interested
to
know
why
we
did
go
all
the
same
said
cicely
it
because
miss
beverley
is
knocked
up
and
ca
teach
us
any
more
and
bennett
is
going
to
london
mother
ca
hear
of
anyone
to
take
miss
beverley
place
or
of
any
equal
to
bennett
so
somehow
or
other
i
feel
that
there
are
changes
in
the
air
oh
merry
merry
suppose
there
no
use
in
it
said
merry
father
will
never
change
get
some
other
dreadfully
dull
daily
governess
and
some
other
fearfully
depressing
and
we
never
be
like
molly
and
belle
and
maggie
and
our
cousin
aneta
it
does
seem
hard
we
must
try
not
to
be
discontented
said
cicely
then
we
had
best
not
ask
maggie
here
too
often
replied
merry
oh
but
they
all
coming
up
morning
for
i
have
asked
them
said
cicely
dear
dear
replied
merry
we
may
as
well
have
what
fun
we
can
remarked
cicely
for
you
know
we
shall
be
going
to
the
seaside
in
ten
days
chapter
viii
ward
school
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
cardew
spent
a
restless
night
cardew
on
the
contrary
slept
with
the
utmost
peace
she
trusted
so
absolutely
in
her
husband
judgment
and
in
in
his
power
to
do
the
very
best
he
could
on
all
possible
occasions
for
her
and
hers
that
she
was
never
deeply
troubled
about
anything
her
dear
husband
must
not
be
forced
to
live
in
london
if
he
did
not
like
to
do
so
and
some
arrangement
must
be
made
for
the
girls
home
education
if
he
could
not
see
his
way
to
sending
them
to
school
great
therefore
was
her
astonishment
on
the
following
morning
when
he
came
hastily
into
her
room
my
dear
he
said
i
am
off
to
london
for
the
day
what
for
she
asked
i
will
tell
you
darling
when
i
return
cyril
may
i
not
come
with
you
i
think
not
my
love
make
all
the
young
people
as
happy
as
you
can
i
just
off
to
the
station
in
the
cardew
left
his
wife
room
the
girls
were
told
at
breakfast
that
their
father
had
gone
to
london
but
as
this
frequently
happened
and
was
invariably
connected
with
that
business
which
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
they
were
not
keenly
interested
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
much
more
absorbed
in
getting
things
ready
for
the
entertainment
of
their
friends
and
in
this
cardew
very
heartily
joined
them
she
proposed
that
during
maggie
howland
visit
the
five
girls
should
have
as
happy
a
time
together
as
possible
and
as
the
weather
was
perfect
the
invariable
picnics
and
gipsy
teas
were
arranged
for
their
benefit
you
can
all
make
yourselves
happy
here
my
darlings
said
cardew
addressing
cicely
and
merry
when
your
father
is
here
the
tristrams
he
and
i
and
you
girls
will
have
a
very
pleasant
picnic
to
the
aldersleigh
woods
we
will
arrange
it
for
there
is
nothing
your
father
enjoys
more
than
a
whole
long
happy
day
in
the
open
air
i
will
speak
to
fairlight
and
tell
her
to
have
all
things
in
readiness
for
our
picnic
oh
mummy
how
good
how
good
said
merry
clasping
her
hand
then
she
added
mummy
is
it
true
that
miss
beverley
is
never
going
to
teach
us
any
more
i
am
afraid
it
is
only
too
true
merry
but
this
is
darling
we
need
talk
of
your
education
just
at
present
only
we
must
be
educated
must
we
mother
of
course
dearest
your
father
will
see
to
that
merry
ran
off
to
join
her
sister
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
whole
of
that
glorious
day
was
one
of
unalloyed
pleasure
the
tristram
girls
were
always
delightful
to
the
cardew
girls
but
now
that
they
were
accompanied
by
maggie
howland
there
was
a
great
addition
to
their
charm
nevertheless
maggie
with
her
purpose
full
in
view
with
her
heart
beating
a
little
more
quickly
than
usual
when
she
heard
that
cardew
had
gone
to
london
religiously
avoided
the
subject
of
the
life
at
aylmer
house
she
felt
somehow
that
she
had
done
her
part
a
great
deal
of
her
own
future
depended
on
these
two
girls
coming
to
aylmer
house
she
would
make
use
of
them
large
use
of
them
at
school
she
was
fond
of
molly
and
belle
but
they
were
poor
maggie
herself
was
poor
she
wanted
to
have
rich
friends
the
cardews
were
rich
by
their
means
she
would
defeat
her
enemy
aneta
lysle
and
establish
herself
not
only
in
the
school
but
with
regard
to
her
future
life
maggie
felt
that
she
could
make
herself
indispensable
to
cicely
and
merry
oh
yes
they
would
certainly
go
to
aylmer
house
in
september
she
need
not
worry
herself
any
further
therefore
with
regard
to
that
matter
little
would
they
guess
how
much
she
had
really
done
toward
this
desirable
goal
and
how
fortunate
circumstances
had
been
in
aiding
her
to
the
accomplishment
of
her
desire
it
was
enough
for
maggie
that
they
were
certainly
going
she
could
therefore
give
herself
up
to
enjoyment
with
maggie
howland
enjoyment
meant
a
very
different
thing
from
what
it
does
to
the
average
english
girl
she
enjoyed
herself
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
without
one
single
reservation
to
see
her
face
at
such
moments
was
to
behold
pure
sunshine
to
hear
her
voice
was
to
listen
to
the
very
essence
of
laughter
and
happiness
she
had
a
marvelous
power
of
telling
stories
and
when
she
was
happy
she
told
them
with
such
verve
that
all
people
within
earshot
hung
on
her
words
then
she
could
improvise
and
dance
and
take
off
almost
any
character
in
short
she
was
the
life
of
every
party
who
admitted
her
within
their
circle
meanwhile
a
rather
tired
and
rather
sad
man
found
himself
very
much
against
his
will
in
london
he
said
to
himself
this
wonderful
ward
will
not
be
at
aylmer
house
now
these
are
the
holidays
and
she
will
be
probably
miles
away
i
will
go
to
see
her
yes
but
she
be
in
that
alone
will
clinch
the
matter
but
first
i
will
pay
a
visit
to
lucia
lysle
she
said
she
would
be
in
london
she
told
my
dear
wife
so
but
lucia
is
so
erratic
it
is
most
improbable
that
she
either
will
be
at
home
cardew
drove
first
of
all
to
lady
lysle
house
in
hans
place
he
asked
if
she
was
within
and
very
much
to
his
annoyance
the
servant
replied
in
the
affirmative
he
entered
lady
lysle
feeling
rather
silly
the
first
person
he
saw
there
was
a
tall
slim
lovely
girl
whom
he
did
not
recognize
at
first
but
who
knew
him
and
ran
up
to
him
and
introduced
herself
as
aneta
why
my
dear
he
said
how
are
you
how
you
have
grown
how
is
dear
cousin
sylvia
and
how
are
cicely
and
merry
asked
aneta
oh
i
am
very
well
indeed
cardew
i
do
suppose
anybody
could
be
anything
but
well
who
was
lucky
enough
to
be
at
aylmer
house
ward
school
said
cardew
feeling
rather
shy
and
almost
of
course
do
you
know
ward
mr
cardew
no
my
dear
i
do
it
the
most
marvelous
school
in
the
world
said
aneta
with
enthusiasm
i
do
wish
you
would
send
cicely
and
merry
there
they
would
have
a
good
time
is
your
aunt
in
said
cardew
a
little
restlessly
oh
yes
she
be
down
in
a
minute
lady
lysle
now
hurried
into
the
room
how
do
you
do
cyril
she
said
i
did
expect
to
find
you
in
town
just
now
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
am
rather
anxious
to
have
a
chat
with
you
replied
cardew
aneta
darling
you
had
better
leave
us
said
her
aunt
the
girl
went
off
with
a
light
laugh
auntie
she
said
i
just
been
telling
cardew
that
he
ought
to
send
cicely
and
merry
to
aylmer
house
she
closed
the
door
as
she
made
this
parting
shot
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
agree
with
aneta
said
lady
lysle
a
couple
of
years
at
that
splendid
school
would
do
the
girls
no
end
of
good
cardew
was
silent
for
a
minute
i
may
as
well
confess
something
to
you
lucia
he
said
then
what
is
it
cyril
i
have
by
no
means
made
up
my
mind
but
we
are
very
much
annoyed
at
the
illness
of
our
daily
governess
miss
beverley
and
at
the
bennett
removing
to
london
so
i
just
thought
i
would
ask
you
a
question
or
two
about
this
wonderful
ward
i
suppose
for
a
single
moment
i
should
dream
of
sending
the
children
there
and
besides
she
is
not
in
london
now
is
she
yes
she
is
replied
lady
lysle
cardew
felt
at
that
moment
that
he
hated
ward
she
came
to
see
me
only
last
evening
she
is
leaving
town
but
if
by
any
chance
you
would
like
to
go
and
see
her
and
thus
judge
of
the
school
for
yourself
it
would
commit
you
to
nothing
of
course
she
will
i
know
be
at
home
all
this
morning
dear
dear
said
cardew
how
very
provoking
what
do
you
mean
cyril
nothing
nothing
of
course
lucia
but
if
as
you
say
the
school
is
so
popular
there
will
be
no
vacancies
for
i
think
some
one
told
me
that
ward
only
took
a
limited
number
of
pupils
there
are
two
vacancies
at
the
present
moment
said
lady
lysle
in
her
calm
voice
although
they
are
likely
to
be
filled
up
immediately
for
ward
has
had
many
applications
but
then
she
is
exceedingly
particular
and
will
only
take
girls
of
high
birth
and
of
very
distinguished
character
doubtless
she
has
filled
up
the
vacancies
by
this
morning
said
cardew
rising
with
some
alacrity
well
thank
you
lucia
as
i
am
in
town
came
up
on
business
you
know
i
may
as
well
just
have
a
look
at
aylmer
house
and
ward
it
will
satisfy
my
dear
wife
why
surely
you
do
for
a
minute
really
intend
to
send
the
girls
there
said
lady
lysle
with
a
superior
smile
i
can
not
tell
what
i
may
do
when
a
man
is
distracted
and
when
a
valuable
daily
governess
breaks
down
and
and
do
question
me
too
closely
lucia
and
keep
our
little
interview
to
yourself
as
i
have
just
said
nothing
will
probably
come
of
this
but
i
will
go
and
see
the
lady
just
to
satisfy
myself
aneta
will
be
delighted
if
you
do
send
the
girls
to
aylmer
house
was
lady
lysle
last
word
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
cardew
found
himself
turning
rather
red
he
left
her
called
a
hansom
and
got
into
it
of
course
the
vacancies
will
be
filled
up
he
said
to
himself
as
he
was
driving
in
the
direction
of
south
kensington
he
further
thought
although
that
good
ward
is
remaining
for
such
an
unconscionable
time
in
town
she
will
very
probably
be
out
this
morning
if
she
is
out
that
puts
an
end
to
everything
but
even
if
she
is
in
she
must
ave
filled
up
her
vacancies
then
i
shall
be
able
to
return
to
the
manor
with
a
quiet
mind
i
have
done
my
best
and
the
thing
will
be
taken
out
of
my
hands
dear
little
merry
i
did
like
that
discontent
on
her
sweet
face
ah
well
she
ca
guess
what
school
is
like
it
not
home
but
i
suppose
the
educational
advantages
would
be
greater
and
a
man
must
sacrifice
himself
for
his
children
odd
what
that
queer
little
miss
howland
told
me
last
night
that
i
was
approaching
a
deed
of
she
a
queer
girl
but
quite
nice
and
aneta
is
a
charming
creature
i
could
never
desire
even
one
of
my
own
precious
girls
to
look
nicer
than
aneta
does
well
here
i
am
now
then
what
will
fate
decide
cardew
sprang
from
the
hansom
desired
the
man
to
wait
ran
up
some
low
steps
and
rang
the
bell
at
the
front
door
of
a
stately
mansion
a
smiling
very
opened
it
for
him
is
ward
within
questioned
cardew
yes
sir
good
heavens
murmured
cardew
under
his
breath
is
she
disengaged
and
can
she
give
me
a
few
moments
of
her
time
continued
the
gentleman
certainly
sir
will
you
come
into
the
what
name
shall
i
say
cardew
produced
one
of
his
cards
have
the
goodness
to
tell
your
mistress
that
if
she
is
particularly
engaged
i
can
he
hesitated
call
another
time
i
will
tell
her
sir
but
ward
is
not
particularly
engaged
she
will
see
you
i
am
sure
directly
the
girl
withdrew
and
cardew
sank
into
a
low
chair
he
had
to
wait
a
few
minutes
and
during
that
time
had
abundant
leisure
to
look
round
the
beautiful
room
in
which
he
found
himself
it
was
so
furnished
as
to
resemble
a
fresh
country
room
the
was
white
the
pictures
were
all
all
original
and
all
the
works
of
artists
they
mostly
represented
country
scenes
but
there
were
a
few
admirable
portraits
of
charming
girls
just
in
the
heyday
of
youth
and
happiness
the
floor
was
of
polished
oak
and
had
a
large
drugget
in
the
center
which
could
be
rolled
up
at
any
moment
if
an
impromptu
dance
was
desirable
the
large
windows
had
boxes
of
flowers
outside
which
were
fresh
and
well
kept
and
had
evidently
been
recently
watered
for
some
sparkling
drops
which
looked
almost
like
summer
rain
still
glistened
on
them
the
room
itself
was
also
decked
with
flowers
in
every
available
corner
and
all
these
flowers
were
fresh
and
beautifully
arranged
they
were
country
flowers
and
of
course
roses
roses
everywhere
there
were
also
great
bowls
of
mignonette
and
large
glass
vases
filled
with
sweet
peas
the
air
of
the
room
was
fresh
and
full
of
delicate
perfume
cardew
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
this
was
a
room
in
which
the
most
refined
young
ladies
in
the
world
might
sit
with
pleasure
and
profit
there
was
a
shelf
for
books
running
round
the
dado
and
the
books
therein
were
good
of
their
kind
and
richly
and
handsomely
bound
there
were
no
small
tables
anywhere
cardew
was
glad
of
that
he
detested
small
tables
but
there
was
a
harp
standing
close
to
the
magnificent
grand
piano
and
several
music
stands
and
a
violin
case
on
a
chair
near
by
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
covered
with
a
cool
fresh
chintz
in
short
it
was
a
charming
room
quite
different
from
the
rooms
at
meredith
manor
which
of
course
were
old
and
magnificent
and
stately
but
it
had
a
refreshing
wholesome
look
about
it
which
in
spite
of
himself
cardew
appreciated
he
had
just
taken
in
the
room
and
its
belongings
when
the
door
was
opened
and
a
lady
of
about
years
of
age
entered
she
was
dressed
very
simply
in
a
long
dress
made
in
a
sort
of
empire
fashion
the
color
was
pale
blue
which
suited
her
calm
fair
face
her
large
eyes
and
her
rich
chestnut
hair
to
perfection
she
came
forward
swiftly
i
am
ward
she
said
and
held
out
her
hand
cardew
considered
himself
a
connoisseur
as
regards
all
women
and
he
was
immediately
impressed
by
a
certain
quality
in
that
face
a
mingling
of
sweetness
and
power
of
extreme
gentleness
and
extreme
determination
there
was
a
lofty
expression
in
the
eyes
too
and
round
the
mouth
which
further
appealed
to
him
and
the
hands
of
the
lady
were
perfect
they
were
white
somewhat
long
with
tapering
fingers
and
nails
there
was
one
signet
ring
on
the
left
hand
worn
as
a
guard
to
the
that
was
all
cardew
was
a
keen
observer
and
he
noted
these
things
at
a
glance
i
have
come
to
talk
to
you
ward
he
said
and
if
you
will
forgive
me
i
should
like
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
there
is
nothing
i
desire
better
said
ward
in
her
exceedingly
and
sympathetic
voice
that
voice
reminded
cardew
of
maggie
howland
and
yet
he
felt
at
once
that
it
was
infinitely
superior
to
hers
sit
down
wo
you
mr
cardew
said
ward
and
she
set
him
the
example
by
seating
herself
in
a
low
chair
as
she
spoke
i
hope
i
am
not
taking
up
too
much
of
your
time
he
said
for
if
so
as
i
said
to
your
servant
i
can
call
again
by
no
means
said
ward
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
this
morning
i
am
therefore
quite
at
your
service
you
will
tell
me
what
you
wish
she
said
in
that
magnetic
voice
of
hers
the
fact
is
simply
this
he
said
my
friend
tristram
who
is
rector
of
meredith
in
warwickshire
is
sending
his
two
daughters
to
your
school
yes
said
ward
gently
molly
and
isabel
are
coming
to
me
next
term
i
am
tristram
near
neighbor
said
cardew
i
live
at
meredith
manor
at
the
present
moment
the
tristram
girls
have
another
pupil
of
yours
staying
with
them
miss
howland
yes
said
ward
very
quietly
lady
lysle
niece
aneta
is
also
one
of
your
pupils
that
is
true
mr
cardew
lady
lysle
is
my
wife
cousin
ward
bowed
very
slightly
i
will
come
to
the
point
now
ward
i
am
the
father
of
two
little
girls
they
are
of
the
same
age
as
molly
and
isabel
tristram
that
is
they
are
both
just
sixteen
they
are
twins
they
are
my
only
children
some
day
they
will
be
rich
for
we
have
no
son
and
they
will
inherit
considerable
property
ward
looked
scarcely
interested
at
this
hitherto
continued
cardew
i
have
stoutly
opposed
for
my
children
and
in
consequence
they
have
been
brought
up
at
home
and
have
had
the
best
advantages
that
could
be
obtained
for
them
in
a
country
life
things
went
apparently
all
right
until
two
or
three
days
ago
when
i
discovered
that
my
girl
her
name
is
meredith
we
call
her
merry
for
short
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
change
her
for
at
the
same
time
our
excellent
daily
governess
and
the
who
taught
the
children
have
been
obliged
to
discontinue
their
work
the
girls
are
at
an
age
when
education
is
essential
and
although
i
schools
i
have
come
here
to
talk
over
the
possibility
of
your
receiving
them
had
you
delayed
coming
to
me
cardew
until
this
evening
i
should
have
had
no
vacancy
for
at
the
present
moment
i
have
twelve
applications
for
the
two
vacancies
which
are
to
be
filled
at
aylmer
house
but
do
you
really
wish
me
to
consider
the
proposal
of
taking
your
girls
when
you
hate
for
young
ladies
cardew
could
not
help
smiling
then
you
are
not
anxious
to
have
them
certainly
not
unless
you
yourself
and
cardew
most
earnestly
desire
to
send
them
to
me
suppose
before
we
go
any
further
that
i
take
you
over
the
house
thank
you
said
cardew
in
a
tone
of
relief
ward
rose
immediately
and
for
the
next
hour
the
and
the
owner
of
meredith
manor
went
from
one
dainty
room
to
another
they
visited
the
gymnasium
they
entered
the
studio
all
the
different
properties
of
the
were
explained
to
the
interested
visitor
the
excellent
playground
was
also
inspected
when
cardew
returned
to
the
ward
said
my
number
of
pupils
is
limited
you
have
seen
for
yourself
that
sisters
are
provided
with
a
room
together
and
that
girls
who
are
not
related
have
rooms
to
themselves
the
house
is
well
warmed
in
winter
and
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
i
keep
it
bright
and
cheerful
with
flowers
and
everything
that
a
judicious
expenditure
of
money
can
secure
i
have
my
own
special
plan
for
educating
my
girls
i
believe
in
personal
influence
in
short
cardew
i
am
not
at
all
ashamed
to
tell
you
that
i
believe
in
my
own
influence
i
have
never
yet
met
a
girl
whom
i
could
not
influence
if
by
any
chance
my
cicely
and
merry
come
to
you
said
cardew
you
will
find
them
i
may
at
least
say
it
perfect
ladies
in
word
and
thought
and
deed
ward
bowed

could
receive
no
others
within
this
establishment
she
said
if
continued
ward
you
decide
to
entrust
your
daughters
to
me
i
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
do
my
best
for
them
to
educate
them
in
a
capacity
to
induce
their
minds
to
work
as
god
meant
them
to
work
without
overtoil
without
undue
haste
and
yet
with
intelligence
and
activity
to
give
them
such
exercises
as
will
promote
health
to
their
bodies
and
to
teach
them
above
all
things
to
live
for
others
not
for
themselves
please
cardew
give
me
no
answer
now
but
think
it
over
the
vacancies
at
aylmer
house
will
remain
at
your
disposal
until
four
this
afternoon
will
you
send
me
before
that
hour
a
telegram
saying
or
i
thank
you
said
cardew
he
wrung
ward
hand
and
left
the
house
the
hall
was
as
spacious
and
nearly
as
beautiful
as
the
and
the
pretty
bright
smiled
at
the
gentleman
as
he
went
out
ward
remained
for
a
time
alone
after
her
visitor
had
left
i
should
like
to
have
those
girls
she
said
to
herself
any
girls
related
to
such
a
splendid
lofty
character
as
aneta
could
not
but
be
welcome
to
me
their
poor
father
he
will
feel
parting
with
them
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
receive
them
next
september
at
this
house
the
thought
had
scarcely
passed
through
her
mind
before
there
came
a
brisk
ring
at
the
front
door
and
lady
lysle
and
aneta
were
announced
oh
dear
mrs
ward
said
lady
lysle
speaking
in
her
quick
impulsive
manner
have
you
seen
my
dear
friend
and
cousin
mr
cardew
and
are
the
girls
coming
to
the
school
asked
aneta
i
have
seen
cardew
said
ward
he
is
a
very
charming
man
he
will
decide
whether
he
will
send
his
daughters
here
or
not
during
the
course
of
but
said
lady
lysle
did
you
urge
him
no
dear
friend
i
never
urge
any
one
to
put
a
girl
in
my
care
i
should
feel
myself
very
wrong
in
doing
so
if
cardew
thinks
well
of
what
he
has
seen
here
he
may
send
his
daughters
to
me
but
i
certainly
did
nothing
to
urge
him
oh
dear
said
aneta
i
should
so
like
them
to
come
you
think
ward
what
nice
people
the
cardews
are
and
the
girls
they
do
want
do
they
auntie
darling
such
a
school
as
this
would
do
them
a
world
of
good
said
lady
lysle
well
i
really
hope
they
will
come
said
ward
but
i
quite
understand
their
father
objections
they
are
evidently
very
precious
treasures
and
he
has
the
sort
of
objection
which
exists
in
the
minds
of
many
country
gentlemen
to
sending
his
girls
to
school
ah
said
aneta
but
there
are
schools
and
schools
the
girls
will
be
exceedingly
rich
said
lady
lysle
their
mother
was
a
meredith
and
belonged
to
an
old
county
family
she
inherits
vast
wealth
the
old
family
place
their
father
is
what
may
be
termed
a
all
the
money
of
the
parents
will
go
to
these
girls
they
are
very
nice
children
but
know
nothing
whatever
of
the
world
it
seems
to
me
a
cruel
thing
that
they
should
be
brought
up
with
no
knowledge
of
the
great
world
where
they
must
eventually
live
i
hope
they
will
come
here
said
ward
great
wealth
means
great
responsibility
they
can
make
magnificent
use
of
their
money
i
should
be
interested
to
have
them
i
know
you
would
my
dear
friend
said
lady
lysle
and
they
are
really
quite
sweet
girls
now
come
aneta
we
must
not
keep
ward
any
longer
when
her
visitors
had
left
her
ward
still
remained
in
the
pleasant
she
sank
into
a
low
chair
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
remained
very
still
although
she
was
only
years
of
age
she
had
been
a
widow
for
over
ten
years
she
had
married
when
quite
a
young
girl
and
had
lost
her
husband
and
child
before
she
was
it
was
in
her
generous
and
noble
nature
to
love
most
passionately
and
all
too
well
for
a
time
after
her
terrible
trouble
she
scarcely
know
how
to
bear
her
grief
then
she
took
it
to
the
one
place
where
such
sorrow
can
be
borne
namely
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
of
god
and
afterwards
it
occurred
to
her
to
devote
her
life
to
the
education
of
others
she
was
quite
and
did
not
need
to
work
for
her
living
but
work
to
a
nature
such
as
hers
was
essential
she
also
needed
the
sympathy
of
others
and
the
love
of
others
and
so
aided
by
her
friends
her
small
but
most
select
school
in
south
kensington
was
started
from
the
very
first
it
was
a
success
it
was
unlike
many
other
schools
for
the
had
broader
and
nobler
views
of
life
she
loved
all
her
girls
and
they
all
loved
her
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
not
to
like
some
girls
more
than
others
and
of
all
the
girls
at
present
at
her
school
aneta
lysle
was
the
one
she
really
loved
best
there
was
also
it
is
sad
to
relate
a
girl
there
whom
she
did
not
love
and
that
girl
was
maggie
howland
there
was
nothing
whatever
with
regard
to
maggie
that
her
mistress
could
lay
hold
of
she
was
quite
aware
of
the
girl
fascination
and
of
her
powerful
influence
over
her
schoolfellows
nevertheless
she
never
thought
of
her
without
a
sense
of
discomfort
maggie
was
one
of
the
girls
who
were
educated
at
aylmer
house
for
a
very
low
fee
for
ward
was
quite
rich
enough
and
generous
enough
to
take
girls
who
could
not
afford
her
full
terms
for
very
much
less
maggie
fees
therefore
were
almost
nominal
and
no
one
knew
this
fact
better
than
maggie
herself
and
her
mother
howland
none
of
her
schoolfellows
knew
for
she
learned
just
what
they
did
and
had
precisely
the
same
advantages
she
was
treated
just
like
the
others
no
one
could
guess
that
her
circumstances
were
different
and
certainly
maggie
would
never
tell
but
none
the
less
did
she
in
her
heart
hate
her
position
as
a
matter
of
fact
molly
and
isabel
tristram
were
also
coming
to
the
school
on
specially
low
terms
but
no
one
would
know
this
maggie
however
suspected
it
and
intended
if
necessary
to
make
the
fact
an
added
power
over
her
young
friends
when
they
all
assembled
at
aylmer
house
yes
said
ward
half
to
herself
i
do
quite
trust
maggie
howland
but
i
can
not
possibly
dismiss
her
from
the
school
i
may
win
her
round
to
a
loftier
standard
of
life
but
at
present
there
is
no
doubt
she
has
not
that
high
ideal
in
view
which
i
think
my
other
girls
aim
at
between
three
and
four
that
day
ward
received
a
telegram
from
cardew
it
contained
the
following
words
after
consideration
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
myself
the
great
honor
of
confiding
my
girls
to
your
care
their
mother
and
i
will
write
to
you
fully
in
a
day
or
two
ward
smiled
when
she
received
the
telegram
i
will
do
my
best
for
those
children
she
said
to
herself
chapter
ix
the
news
cardew
arrived
at
meredith
manor
very
late
that
evening
the
long
and
happy
day
had
come
to
an
end
the
tristram
girls
and
maggie
howland
had
returned
to
the
rectory
cicely
and
merry
were
having
a
long
confidential
chat
together
they
were
in
merry
bedroom
they
had
dismissed
their
maid
they
were
talking
of
the
pleasures
of
the
day
and
in
particular
were
discussing
the
delightful
fact
that
their
beautiful
cousin
aneta
had
wired
to
say
she
would
be
with
them
in
two
days
time
they
had
not
seen
aneta
for
some
years
but
they
both
remembered
her
vividly
her
memory
shone
out
before
them
both
as
something
specially
dazzling
and
specially
beautiful
maggie
howland
too
had
spoken
of
aneta
beauty
maggie
had
been
told
that
aneta
was
coming
and
maggie
had
expressed
pleasure
whatever
maggie
private
feelings
may
have
been
she
was
very
careful
now
to
express
delight
at
appearance
at
meredith
manor
what
a
darling
she
is
said
merry
i
doubt
very
much
i
suppose
it
rank
heresy
to
say
so
cicely
but
i
really
greatly
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
prefer
aneta
to
maggie
what
are
mere
looks
after
all
when
one
possesses
such
charm
as
maggie
has
that
seems
to
me
a
much
greater
gift
we
need
not
compare
them
need
we
said
cicely
oh
certainly
not
said
merry
but
cicely
darling
does
it
seem
funny
that
such
a
lot
of
girls
who
are
all
to
meet
in
september
at
aylmer
house
should
be
practically
staying
with
us
at
the
present
moment
yes
indeed
said
cicely
i
feel
almost
as
though
i
belonged
to
it
which
of
course
is
quite
ridiculous
for
we
shall
never
by
any
chance
go
there
of
course
not
said
merry
and
she
sighed
after
a
time
cicely
said
i
wonder
what
father
went
to
town
for
well
we
do
know
so
where
the
use
of
troubling
said
merry
i
asked
mother
said
cicely
why
he
went
to
town
and
she
said
she
could
tell
me
but
she
got
rather
red
as
she
spoke
cicely
said
merry
after
a
long
pause
when
these
glorious
holidays
come
to
an
end
and
the
aylmer
house
girls
have
gone
to
aylmer
house
what
shall
you
and
i
do
do
said
cicely
do
i
suppose
what
we
always
done
a
fresh
governess
will
be
found
and
another
and
we
work
at
our
lessons
and
do
the
best
we
can
merry
gave
a
deep
sigh
we
never
talk
french
like
belle
tristram
she
said
and
never
play
so
that
any
one
will
care
to
listen
to
us
we
never
never
know
the
world
the
way
the
others
know
it
there
seems
very
little
use
in
being
rich
when
one
ca
get
education
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
there
came
a
light
tap
at
the
door
before
they
could
reply
it
was
opened
and
cardew
came
in
she
looked
as
though
she
had
been
crying
nevertheless
there
was
a
joyful
sort
of
triumph
on
her
face
she
said
quickly
i
thought
somehow
you
two
naughty
children
would
not
be
in
bed
and
i
told
father
that
i
come
up
on
the
chance
of
finding
you
father
has
come
back
from
london
and
has
something
important
to
tell
you
will
you
come
down
with
me
at
once
oh
mother
mother
what
is
it
said
merry
in
a
tone
of
excitement
which
was
slightly
mingled
with
awe
your
father
will
tell
you
my
darling
said
cardew
she
put
her
arm
round
merry
slight
waist
and
held
cicely
hand
and
they
came
down
to
the
great
where
cardew
was
waiting
for
them
he
was
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
folded
behind
his
back
his
face
was
slightly
tired
and
yet
he
too
wore
that
odd
expression
of
mingled
triumph
and
pain
which
cardew
eyes
expressed
when
the
mother
and
the
girls
entered
the
room
he
at
once
shut
the
door
cardew
looked
first
of
all
at
merry
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
come
to
me
little
girl
he
said
she
flew
to
him
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
she
kissed
him
several
times
oh
dad
dad
she
said
i
know
i
was
downright
horrid
and
unkind
and
perfectly
dreadful
yesterday
and
i
do
no
i
want
to
leave
you
and
mother
if
i
was
discontented
then
i
am
not
now
merry
believed
her
own
words
at
that
moment
for
the
look
on
her
father
face
had
struck
to
her
very
heart
he
disengaged
her
pretty
arms
very
gently
and
still
holding
her
hand
went
up
to
cicely
who
was
clinging
to
her
mother
i
have
just
got
some
news
for
you
both
he
said
you
know
of
course
that
miss
beverley
can
not
teach
you
any
longer
poor
old
beverley
said
cicely
we
are
so
sorry
but
you
find
another
good
governess
for
us
wo
you
dad
i
am
afraid
i
ca
said
cardew
so
i
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
that
i
have
broken
the
resolve
which
i
always
meant
to
keep
you
have
what
said
merry
i
have
turned
my
back
on
a
determination
which
i
made
when
you
were
both
very
little
girls
and
i
went
up
to
town
and
saw
mrs
ward
oh
said
merry
she
turned
white
and
dropped
her
father
hand
and
clasping
her
own
two
hands
tightly
together
gazed
at
him
as
though
she
would
devour
his
face
well
it
all
settled
children
said
cardew
and
when
september
comes
you
will
go
with
your
friends
molly
and
belle
to
aylmer
house
this
announcement
was
received
at
first
in
total
silence
then
merry
flew
to
her
father
and
kissed
him
a
great
many
times
and
cicely
kissed
her
mother
then
merry
said
we
ca
talk
of
it
we
ca
quite
realize
it
but
but
we
are
glad
then
she
took
cicely
hand
and
they
went
out
of
the
room
and
cardew
watched
them
as
the
little
figures
approached
the
door
merry
opened
it
and
they
both
passed
out
i
wonder
said
cardew
looking
at
his
wife
if
they
are
going
out
of
our
lives
indeed
no
said
cardew
from
what
you
have
told
me
of
ward
she
must
be
a
good
woman
one
of
the
best
she
is
one
of
the
very
very
best
sylvia
and
i
think
the
very
happiest
thing
for
us
both
would
be
to
run
up
to
town
and
for
you
to
see
her
for
yourself
very
well
darling
we
will
do
so
said
cardew
chapter
aneta
so
everything
was
settled
cicely
and
merry
scarcely
slept
at
all
that
night
they
were
too
much
excited
the
news
was
too
wonderful
now
that
their
wish
was
granted
there
was
pain
mingled
with
their
joy
it
seems
as
though
perfect
joy
must
have
its
modicum
of
pain
to
make
it
perfect
but
when
the
next
morning
dawned
the
regret
of
the
night
before
seemed
to
have
vanished
in
the
first
place
and
cardew
had
gone
early
to
london
and
the
mere
fact
that
their
father
and
mother
were
not
present
was
a
sort
of
relief
to
the
excited
girls
the
picnic
need
not
be
postponed
for
and
tristram
could
act
as
chaperons
on
this
auspicious
occasion
they
were
all
to
meet
at
the
manor
at
eleven
and
punctual
to
the
hour
a
goodly
array
of
happy
young
people
walked
up
the
avenue
and
entered
the
porch
of
the
andrew
devoted
to
maggie
was
present
jack
equally
maggie
slave
was
also
there
maggie
herself
looking
neat
and
happy
was
helping
every
one
molly
and
belle
all
in
white
and
looking
as
charming
as
little
girls
could
were
full
of
expectation
of
their
long
and
delightful
day
one
wagonette
could
hold
the
whole
party
and
as
it
drove
round
to
the
front
door
the
boys
fiercely
took
possession
of
the
fighting
with
the
coachman
who
said
that
there
would
be
no
room
for
miss
howland
to
sit
between
them
well
then
mags
if
that
is
the
case
said
peterkins
you
get
along
in
at
once
and
take
this
corner
close
to
me
then
whenever
we
want
we
can
do
a
bit
of
whispering
you
wo
whisper
more
than
your
share
said
jackdaw
i
a
frightful
lot
to
say
to
mags
this
morning
hush
boys
said
maggie
if
you
quarrel
about
me
i
shall
not
speak
to
either
of
you
this
threat
was
so
awful
that
the
boys
glanced
at
each
other
remained
silent
and
got
quietly
into
their
places
then
the
hampers
were
put
on
the
floor
just
under
their
feet
presently
cicely
and
merry
came
out
to
join
the
group
they
were
wearing
pretty
pink
muslins
with
pink
sashes
to
match
beautiful
dark
eyes
were
very
bright
and
tristram
inquired
for
their
host
and
hostess
oh
i
have
news
for
you
said
merry
yes
said
cicely
merry
will
tell
well
it
just
this
said
merry
almost
jerking
out
her
words
in
excitement
father
and
mother
have
been
obliged
to
go
rather
unexpectedly
to
town
why
said
maggie
then
she
restrained
herself
knowing
that
it
was
not
her
place
to
speak
they
have
gone
to
town
said
merry
scarcely
looking
at
maggie
now
and
endeavoring
with
all
her
might
and
main
not
to
show
undue
excitement
because
a
great
and
wonderful
thing
has
happened
something
so
unexpected
that
that
cicely
and
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
maggie
glanced
at
the
sweet
little
faces
she
said
to
herself
all
right
and
got
calmly
into
the
wagonette
where
she
sat
close
under
the
which
contained
those
obstreperous
young
heroes
andrew
and
jack
the
others
clustered
round
merry
as
i
said
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
said
merry
but
father
has
done
the
most
marvelous
thing
oh
belle
oh
molly
it
is
too
wonderful
for
after
all
after
all
cicely
and
i
are
to
go
with
you
to
aylmer
house
in
september
and
and
that
is
why
father
and
mother
have
gone
to
town
father
went
up
yesterday
and
saw
ward
and
he
he
settled
it
and
father
and
mother
have
gone
up
both
of
them
to
see
her
and
to
make
final
arrangements
and
we
to
go
we
to
hurrah
cried
molly
immediately
the
boys
and
maggie
and
belle
and
even
and
tristram
took
up
the
glad
hurrah
well
children
said
tristram
when
the
first
excitement
had
subsided
i
must
say
i
am
heartily
pleased
this
is
delightful
i
take
some
credit
to
myself
for
having
helped
on
this
most
excellent
arrangement
no
one
thanks
me
for
anything
thought
maggie
but
she
had
the
prudence
to
remain
silent
we
had
better
start
on
our
picnic
now
said
tristram
and
immediately
the
whole
party
climbed
into
the
wagonette
the
horses
started
the
wheels
rolled
they
were
off
merry
felt
her
hand
taken
by
maggie
maggie
just
squeezed
that
hand
and
whispered
in
that
very
very
rich
and
wonderfully
seductive
voice
of
hers
oh
i
am
glad
i
am
very
very
glad
merry
felt
her
heart
thrill
as
maggie
uttered
those
words
she
answered
back
turning
her
face
to
her
young
companion
to
be
with
you
alone
would
be
happiness
enough
for
me
is
it
true
cicely
said
tristram
at
the
moment
that
your
cousin
aneta
lysle
is
coming
to
stay
with
you
oh
yes
but
i
had
it
in
all
this
excitement
said
cicely
she
will
arrive
maggie
you
be
glad
you
more
than
delighted
said
maggie
it
is
too
wonderful
said
cicely
why
it
will
soon
come
to
pass
that
half
ward
school
will
be
all
together
during
the
holidays
fancy
we
two
and
you
two
she
touched
one
of
the
tristram
girls
and
you
maggie
and
then
dear
aneta
why
that
make
six
what
a
lot
we
shall
have
to
talk
about
maggie
you
and
aneta
will
be
our
two
heroines
we
shall
always
be
applying
to
you
for
information
the
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
jackdaw
who
pinched
maggie
on
the
arm
you
not
attending
to
us
he
said
nonsense
jackdaw
well
stand
up
for
a
minute
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
maggie
who
never
lost
a
chance
of
ingratiating
herself
with
any
one
obeyed
jack
dear
do
be
troublesome
said
his
mother
i
am
not
said
jackdaw
she
loves
it
the
duck
that
she
is
be
quick
jackdaw
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
keep
my
hold
standing
up
said
maggie
how
many
chocolates
can
you
eat
at
a
pinch
whispered
jackdaw
in
her
ear
oh
forty
replied
maggie
but
i
should
be
rather
ill
afterwards
we
got
some
in
our
pockets
they
a
little
bit
clammy
but
you
do
mind
that
i
do
want
any
just
now
dear
boy
and
i
tell
you
why
i
want
to
be
really
starving
hungry
when
the
picnic
begins
that
a
good
notion
is
it
said
i
say
andrew
she
wants
to
be
starving
hungry
when
the
picnic
begins
maggie
resumed
her
seat
and
the
boys
went
on
whispering
together
and
kicking
each
other
at
intervals
and
rather
upsetting
that
very
stolid
personage
charles
the
meredith
manor
coachman
the
picnic
was
a
perfect
success
when
people
are
very
happy
there
is
no
room
for
discontent
in
their
hearts
and
all
the
members
of
that
party
were
in
the
highest
spirits
the
cardew
girls
had
no
time
yet
for
that
period
of
regret
which
must
invariably
follow
a
period
of
intense
excitement
they
had
no
time
yet
to
realize
that
they
must
part
with
their
father
and
mother
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
to
children
so
intensely
affectionate
as
cicely
and
merry
such
a
parting
must
mean
considerable
pain
but
even
the
beginning
of
the
pain
did
not
come
to
them
on
that
auspicious
day
and
they
returned
to
the
house
after
the
picnic
in
the
highest
and
tristram
however
were
wise
in
their
generation
and
although
cicely
and
merry
begged
and
implored
the
whole
party
to
come
to
the
manor
for
supper
they
very
firmly
declined
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
both
jack
and
andrew
turned
sulky
on
this
occasion
as
the
rectory
girls
and
maggie
and
the
boys
and
and
tristam
were
all
going
homewards
the
two
girls
and
maggie
fell
behind
is
this
real
fun
is
it
magnificent
said
molly
tristram
it
a
very
good
thing
indeed
for
your
friends
cicely
and
merry
said
maggie
then
she
added
did
i
tell
you
girls
that
you
would
win
your
bracelets
belle
felt
herself
changing
color
we
do
want
them
a
bit
we
really
do
said
molly
of
course
we
do
want
them
said
isabel
you
have
them
all
the
same
said
maggie
they
are
my
present
to
you
surely
you
wo
refuse
my
present
but
such
a
very
rich
and
handsome
present
we
ought
not
to
accept
said
molly
nonsense
girls
i
shall
be
unhappy
unless
you
wear
them
when
i
return
to
mother
which
alas
i
must
do
before
many
days
are
over
i
shall
send
you
the
bracelets
i
wish
you
would
maggie
said
belle
tristram
for
i
am
certain
father
and
mother
would
not
like
us
to
wear
jewelry
while
we
are
so
young
well
then
said
maggie
i
will
give
them
to
you
when
we
all
meet
at
aylmer
house
you
must
take
them
you
know
you
promised
you
would
you
will
hurt
me
most
frightfully
if
you
do
as
molly
and
isabel
certainly
did
not
wish
to
hurt
maggie
they
remained
silent
and
during
the
rest
of
the
walk
the
three
girls
scarcely
spoke
meanwhile
cicely
and
merry
entered
the
manor
house
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
return
of
their
father
and
mother
we
must
get
everything
extra
nice
for
them
said
cicely
to
her
sister
i
do
think
it
is
so
wonderfully
splendid
of
them
to
send
us
to
school
the
sun
had
already
set
and
twilight
had
come
on
but
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
and
cardew
to
arrive
at
the
manor
until
about
ten
what
therefore
was
the
amazement
of
the
girls
when
they
heard
in
the
distance
father
and
mother
could
not
possibly
have
done
their
business
and
caught
the
early
train
said
merry
in
some
excitement
who
can
be
coming
now
the
next
moment
their
doubts
were
set
at
rest
for
aneta
lysle
entered
the
hall
i
came
after
all
she
said
auntie
thought
it
would
be
more
convenient
you
got
my
telegram
did
you
these
words
were
uttered
while
her
two
cousins
in
rapture
and
delight
were
kissing
her
no
no
said
merry
we
got
no
telegram
but
oh
aneta
we
are
glad
to
see
you
here
the
telegram
on
the
said
aneta
and
she
took
up
a
yellow
envelope
this
was
addressed
to
cardew
meredith
manor
yes
i
know
this
must
be
from
me
said
aneta
but
why
did
you
open
it
well
the
fact
is
said
cicely
father
and
mother
were
in
london
and
the
rest
of
us
were
out
on
a
picnic
but
it
does
matter
a
bit
you
come
and
the
sooner
the
better
oh
it
is
nice
to
see
you
again
but
how
tall
you
are
neta
and
how
grown
up
you
look
i
am
seventeen
remember
said
aneta
i
do
feel
but
auntie
says
i
look
it
oh
come
into
the
light
do
said
merry
and
let
see
you
heard
so
very
much
of
you
lately
and
we
want
to
look
at
your
darling
face
again
and
i
want
to
look
at
you
both
said
aneta
in
her
affectionate
manner
the
servants
had
conveyed
miss
lysle
luggage
into
the
house
and
now
the
three
girls
with
their
arms
twined
round
each
other
entered
the
same
big
where
cardew
had
given
his
wonderful
news
of
the
night
before
there
was
a
blaze
of
electric
light
and
this
judiciously
softened
with
silk
was
most
becoming
to
all
those
who
came
under
its
influence
but
the
strongest
glare
of
light
could
not
disfigure
any
one
so
absolutely
beautiful
as
aneta
lysle
her
delicate
complexion
the
wonderful
purity
and
regularity
of
her
features
her
sweet
tender
young
mouth
her
charming
blue
eyes
and
her
great
luxuriance
of
golden
hair
made
people
who
looked
at
her
once
long
to
study
that
charming
face
again
and
yet
again
there
was
no
vanity
about
this
young
girl
her
manner
her
expression
were
simplicity
itself
there
was
a
certain
nobility
about
her
fine
forehead
and
the
shape
of
her
head
was
classical
and
showed
undoubted
talent
her
clear
musical
voice
was
in
itself
a
charm
her
young
figure
was
the
very
personification
of
grace
beside
her
cicely
and
merry
felt
awkward
and
commonplace
not
that
they
were
so
but
very
few
people
could
attain
to
aneta
lysle
incomparable
beauty
well
girls
she
said
you
do
look
sweet
both
of
you
oh
neta
what
a
darling
you
are
said
merry
who
worshipped
beauty
and
had
never
come
across
any
one
so
lovely
as
her
cousin
it
two
years
since
we
met
she
continued
and
you
have
altered
and
not
altered
you
more
and
more
more
stately
but
your
face
is
the
same
whenever
we
want
to
think
of
the
angels
we
think
of
you
too
neta
that
is
very
sweet
of
you
darlings
but
indeed
i
am
far
from
being
an
angel
i
am
just
a
very
human
girl
and
please
if
you
do
mind
we
wo
discuss
my
looks
any
more
cicely
and
merry
both
save
their
cousin
a
thoughtful
glance
then
they
said
eagerly
you
must
come
to
your
room
and
wash
your
hands
and
get
refreshed
for
supper
for
of
course
you
are
starving
i
shall
like
to
have
something
to
eat
said
aneta
what
room
am
i
to
have
girls
oh
the
white
room
next
to
ours
we
arranged
it
all
this
morning
said
cicely
well
come
along
at
once
said
aneta
soon
the
three
girls
found
themselves
in
the
beautiful
bedroom
which
had
been
arranged
for
aneta
reception
as
soon
as
ever
they
got
there
cicely
clasped
one
of
her
cousin
arms
and
merry
the
other
we
have
news
for
you
news
they
said
yes
said
aneta
looking
at
them
with
her
bright
soft
eyes
most
wonderful
most
extraordinary
most
most
beautiful
said
merry
speaking
almost
with
passion
we
going
to
your
school
yes
to
yours
to
aylmer
house
in
september
could
you
have
believed
it
think
of
father
consenting
and
just
because
i
felt
a
little
discontented
oh
is
he
an
angel
father
of
all
people
who
until
now
would
not
hear
of
our
leaving
home
but
we
going
well
said
aneta
i
am
not
greatly
surprised
for
i
happen
to
know
that
your
father
cousin
cyril
came
to
see
auntie
yesterday
and
afterwards
he
went
to
visit
ward
and
after
his
visit
we
saw
ward
and
although
he
had
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
then
whether
he
would
send
you
or
not
we
quite
thought
he
would
do
so
yes
this
is
splendid
i
he
able
to
tell
you
lots
about
the
school
but
after
all
it
is
the
school
that
matters
then
what
matters
aneta
it
ward
herself
said
aneta
it
she
who
makes
the
whole
thing
so
perfect
she
guides
us
she
enlightens
us
sometimes
i
can
scarcely
talk
of
her
my
love
for
her
and
my
passion
for
her
are
so
deep
cicely
and
merry
looked
thoughtful
for
a
minute
i
ready
now
to
come
downstairs
said
aneta
and
they
went
down
to
find
supper
prepared
for
them
and
the
old
butler
waiting
to
attend
on
his
young
ladies
after
the
meal
was
over
the
girls
retired
to
the
where
they
all
three
sat
by
one
of
the
windows
waiting
for
and
cardew
return
merry
then
said
it
is
so
funny
of
you
aneta
to
speak
as
though
the
school
was
mrs
ward
but
it
is
said
aneta
surely
surely
said
merry
it
the
girls
too
you
will
be
surprised
perhaps
aneta
to
hear
said
cicely
that
our
dear
darling
friends
our
greatest
except
yourself
perhaps
and
you
a
sort
of
sister
molly
and
isabel
tristram
are
also
going
to
aylmer
house
in
september
they
are
so
nice
you
will
like
them
and
then
of
course
there
maggie
howland
one
of
the
most
charming
girls
we
have
come
across
whom
did
you
say
asked
aneta
maggie
howland
she
is
here
in
this
house
said
aneta
no
she
is
at
the
rectory
she
is
a
special
friend
of
molly
and
isabel
she
has
been
at
school
with
them
before
in
hanover
you
know
her
of
course
she
is
one
of
the
girls
at
aylmer
house
i
know
her
oh
yes
i
know
her
said
aneta
and
you
like
her
you
feel
her
charm
you
you
almost
worship
her
do
you
neta
aneta
was
silent
oh
i
know
she
is
considered
plain
said
merry
but
something
about
her
which
prevents
one
even
considering
her
features
she
is
the
most
unselfish
most
fascinating
girl
we
have
ever
come
across
you
love
her
do
you
neta
there
had
come
a
curious
change
over
aneta
face
after
a
brief
pause
she
said
i
have
no
right
to
say
it
but
you
two
are
my
cousins
yes
yes
what
does
this
mean
said
cicely
with
great
eagerness
well
i
know
you
will
be
faithful
and
not
repeat
it
to
any
one
but
i
do
love
maggie
howland
oh
neta
and
continued
aneta
you
as
my
cousins
i
most
earnestly
hope
will
not
make
her
your
special
friend
at
aylmer
house
but
we
have
done
so
already
neta
oh
neta
darling
you
are
mistaken
in
her
i
say
nothing
whatever
against
her
said
aneta
except
that
personally
i
do
not
care
for
her
i
should
be
very
glad
if
i
found
that
i
had
misjudged
her
then
why
do
you
want
us
to
be
friends
with
her
we
are
friends
with
her
i
can
not
control
you
darlings
when
you
come
to
school
you
will
see
a
variety
of
girls
and
most
of
them
indeed
all
of
them
nice
i
think
then
why
should
we
like
poor
maggie
you
do
like
her
it
seems
already
yes
but
you
are
so
mysterious
neta
i
can
not
say
any
more
you
must
forgive
me
answered
aneta
and
i
hear
the
sound
of
wheels
your
father
and
mother
are
coming
yes
yes
the
darlings
said
merry
rushing
into
the
hall
to
meet
her
parents
aneta
and
cicely
followed
her
example
and
there
was
great
excitement
and
much
talk
cardew
was
now
as
anxious
that
the
girls
should
go
to
aylmer
house
as
though
she
herself
had
always
wished
for
such
an
arrangement
while
cardew
could
not
say
enough
in
praise
you
agree
with
me
aneta
said
cardew
that
the
school
is
quite
unique
and
above
the
ordinary
ward
is
unique
and
above
the
ordinary
was
aneta
reply
when
the
girls
retired
to
their
own
rooms
that
night
cicely
and
merry
met
for
a
brief
moment
how
funny
of
aneta
not
to
like
maggie
said
merry
well
if
i
were
you
merry
said
cicely
i
would
talk
about
it
i
suppose
aneta
is
prejudiced
yes
said
merry
but
against
maggie
of
all
people
well
i
for
my
part
will
never
give
her
up
i
suppose
said
cicely
who
was
more
conscientious
than
her
sister
that
we
ought
to
think
something
of
aneta
opinion
oh
that
very
fine
said
merry
but
we
ought
to
think
something
too
of
molly
opinion
and
belle
opinion
they
have
known
maggie
longer
than
aneta
has
yes
replied
cicely
i
forgot
that
but
is
aneta
herself
delightful
it
a
pure
joy
to
look
at
her
it
certainly
is
said
merry
and
of
course
i
love
her
dearly
and
am
very
proud
of
her
but
i
confess
i
did
not
quite
like
her
when
she
spoke
in
that
queer
way
about
dear
little
maggie
i
at
least
am
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
will
induce
me
to
give
maggie
up
of
course
we
wo
give
her
up
said
cicely
but
she
spoke
with
thought
chapter
xi
ten
pounds
in
perfect
summer
weather
when
the
heart
is
brimful
of
happiness
and
when
a
great
desire
has
been
unexpectedly
fulfilled
what
can
there
possibly
be
more
delightful
than
an
life
this
was
what
the
girls
who
belonged
to
the
rectory
and
the
girls
who
belonged
to
the
manor
now
found
and
cardew
and
and
tristram
could
not
do
enough
for
their
benefit
maggie
could
only
stay
for
one
week
longer
with
her
friends
but
aneta
had
changed
her
mind
with
regard
to
belgium
and
was
to
go
with
the
young
cardews
to
the
seaside
and
cardew
had
asked
the
tristram
girls
to
accompany
them
she
had
also
extended
her
invitation
to
maggie
who
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
accept
it
she
wrote
to
her
mother
on
the
subject
howland
made
a
brief
reply
you
know
it
is
impossible
maggie
you
must
come
back
to
me
early
next
week
i
can
not
do
without
you
so
say
no
more
about
it
maggie
was
a
girl
with
a
really
excellent
temper
and
recognizing
that
her
mother
had
a
good
reason
for
not
giving
her
the
desired
holiday
made
the
best
of
things
meanwhile
cicely
and
merry
watched
her
carefully
as
to
aneta
she
was
perfectly
cordial
with
maggie
not
talking
to
her
much
it
is
true
but
never
showing
the
slightest
objection
to
her
society
nevertheless
there
was
since
the
arrival
of
aneta
on
the
scene
a
strange
undefinable
change
in
the
atmosphere
merry
noticed
this
more
than
cicely
it
felt
to
her
electrical
as
though
there
might
be
a
storm
brewing
on
the
day
before
maggie
was
to
return
to
london
to
take
up
her
abode
in
her
mother
dull
house
in
shepherd
bush
a
magnificent
picnic
on
a
larger
scale
even
than
usual
was
the
order
of
the
hour
some
young
girls
of
the
name
of
heathfield
who
lived
a
little
way
off
were
asked
to
meredith
manor
to
spend
the
night
and
these
girls
who
were
exceedingly
jolly
and
bright
and
lively
were
a
fresh
source
of
delight
to
all
those
whom
they
happened
to
meet
their
names
were
susan
and
mary
heathfield
they
were
older
than
the
tristrams
and
the
cardews
and
had
in
fact
just
left
school
their
last
year
of
had
been
spent
in
paris
they
were
highly
educated
and
had
an
enviable
proficiency
in
the
french
tongue
and
heathfield
the
parents
of
these
girls
were
also
guests
at
the
manor
so
that
the
picnic
on
this
last
day
of
maggie
visit
to
the
rectory
was
quite
a
large
one
they
drove
nearly
twenty
miles
to
a
beautiful
place
not
far
from
warwick
there
the
usual
picnic
arrangements
were
made
with
great
satisfaction
dinner
was
eaten
and
presently
there
was
to
be
a
this
all
the
girls
looked
forward
to
and
andrew
and
jack
were
wild
with
delight
over
the
prospect
of
making
the
kettle
boil
this
particular
task
was
given
to
them
and
very
proud
they
were
of
the
trust
reposed
in
them
but
now
dinner
being
over
the
older
people
took
shelter
from
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
under
the
trees
and
the
young
people
moved
about
in
groups
or
in
couples
merry
cardew
found
herself
alone
with
maggie
howland
without
intending
to
do
so
she
had
slightly
very
slightly
avoided
maggie
during
the
last
day
or
two
but
maggie
now
seized
her
arm
and
drew
her
down
a
shady
glade
come
with
me
merry
she
said
i
have
a
lot
i
want
to
say
to
you
merry
looked
at
her
of
course
i
will
come
with
you
maggie
she
answered
i
want
just
to
get
quite
away
from
the
others
continued
maggie
for
we
shall
not
meet
again
until
we
meet
in
the
autumn
at
aylmer
house
you
do
know
perhaps
do
you
merry
that
you
owe
the
great
joy
of
coming
to
that
lovely
school
to
me
to
you
said
merry
in
the
utmost
amazement
yes
replied
maggie
in
her
calmest
tone
to
me
oh
dear
maggie
replied
merry
you
surely
must
be
mistaken
i
do
intend
to
explain
myself
said
maggie
i
simply
state
what
is
a
fact
you
owe
your
to
me
it
was
i
who
inserted
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
beneath
your
father
fixed
resolution
that
you
were
to
be
educated
at
home
it
was
i
in
short
who
acted
the
part
of
the
fairy
princess
and
who
pulled
those
silken
reins
which
brought
about
the
desire
of
your
heart
i
do
understand
you
maggie
said
merry
in
a
distressful
tone
but
i
suppose
she
added
as
you
say
so
it
is
the
case
only
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
what
really
and
truly
happened
was
this
oh
i
know
quite
well
what
really
and
truly
happened
interrupted
maggie
let
me
tell
you
i
know
that
there
came
a
certain
day
when
a
little
girl
who
calls
herself
merry
cardew
was
very
discontented
and
i
know
also
that
kind
cardew
discovered
the
discontent
of
his
child
well
now
who
put
that
discontent
into
your
mind
why
i
am
afraid
it
was
you
said
merry
turning
pale
and
then
red
maggie
laughed
why
of
course
it
was
she
said
and
you
suppose
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
but
maggie
you
did
really
mean
you
could
for
a
minute
mean
that
i
was
to
be
miserable
at
home
if
father
did
give
his
consent
of
course
not
said
maggie
lightly
but
you
see
i
meant
him
to
give
his
consent
i
meant
it
all
the
time
i
own
that
there
were
several
favoring
circumstances
but
i
want
to
tell
you
now
merry
in
the
strictest
confidence
of
course
that
from
the
moment
i
arrived
at
the
rectory
i
determined
that
you
and
cicely
were
to
come
with
molly
and
isabel
to
aylmer
house
it
was
very
kind
of
you
maggie
said
merry
but
she
felt
a
certain
sense
of
distress
which
she
could
not
quite
account
for
as
she
spoke
why
do
you
look
so
melancholy
said
maggie
turning
and
fixing
her
queer
narrow
eyes
on
the
pretty
face
of
her
young
companion
i
am
not
really
melancholy
only
i
would
much
rather
you
had
told
me
openly
at
the
time
that
you
wished
me
to
come
to
school
maggie
gave
a
faint
sigh
had
i
done
so
darling
she
said
you
would
never
have
come
you
must
leave
your
poor
friend
maggie
to
manage
things
in
her
own
way
but
now
i
have
something
else
to
talk
about
they
had
gone
far
down
the
glade
and
were
completely
separated
from
their
companions
sit
down
said
maggie
it
too
hot
to
walk
far
even
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
they
both
sat
down
maggie
tossed
off
her
hat
she
said
you
will
perhaps
be
having
another
picnic
or
at
any
rate
the
best
of
good
times
with
your
friends
i
hope
so
replied
merry
but
i
shall
be
in
hot
stifling
london
in
a
little
house
in
poky
lodgings
at
this
hour
i
shall
not
be
having
what
you
call
a
good
time
but
maggie
you
will
be
with
your
mother
yes
poor
darling
mother
of
course
do
you
love
her
very
much
asked
merry
maggie
flashed
round
an
excited
glance
at
her
companion
love
her
yes
she
said
i
love
her
but
you
must
love
her
tremendously
said
merry
as
much
as
i
love
my
mother
as
a
rule
all
girls
love
their
mothers
said
maggie
we
are
not
talking
about
that
now
are
we
what
do
you
want
to
say
to
me
in
particular
maggie
was
response
this
we
shall
meet
at
school
on
the
of
september
there
will
be
as
i
have
told
you
already
twenty
boarders
at
aylmer
house
you
will
arrive
at
the
school
as
strangers
so
will
molly
and
isabel
arrive
as
strangers
but
you
will
have
two
friends
aneta
lysle
and
myself
you
very
much
taken
with
your
cousin
aneta
are
you
not
taken
with
her
said
merry
that
seems
to
me
a
curious
expression
she
is
our
cousin
and
she
is
beautiful
merry
i
must
tell
you
something
at
aylmer
house
there
are
two
individuals
who
lead
the
school
oh
said
merry
i
thought
ward
led
the
school
of
course
of
course
ward
is
just
splendid
but
you
see
you
poor
merry
know
nothing
of
is
really
controlled
i
mean
the
inner
part
of
it
by
the
girls
themselves
now
there
are
two
girls
at
aylmer
house
who
control
the
school
one
of
them
is
your
humble
servant
maggie
howland
the
other
is
your
cousin
aneta
lysle
aneta
does
not
love
me
and
to
be
frank
with
you
i
hate
her
merry
found
herself
turning
very
red
she
remembered
aneta
words
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
she
has
already
told
you
said
maggie
that
she
does
like
me
merry
remained
silent
oh
you
need
speak
i
know
quite
well
said
maggie
merry
felt
more
and
more
uncomfortable
the
petition
i
have
to
make
to
you
is
this
continued
maggie
that
at
school
you
will
for
a
time
at
least
say
for
the
first
month
or
so
be
i
want
you
and
cicely
and
molly
and
isabel
to
belong
neither
to
aneta
party
nor
to
mine
and
i
want
you
to
do
this
because
because
i
have
been
the
person
who
has
got
you
to
aylmer
house
just
remain
neutral
for
a
month
will
you
promise
me
that
i
do
understand
you
you
puzzle
me
very
much
indeed
said
merry
you
will
understand
fast
enough
when
you
get
to
aylmer
house
i
wish
i
were
not
going
away
i
wish
i
had
to
return
to
mother
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
all
to
scarborough
but
i
am
the
last
girl
on
earth
to
neglect
my
duties
and
my
duty
is
to
be
with
poor
dear
mother
you
will
understand
that
what
i
ask
is
but
reasonable
if
four
new
girls
came
to
the
school
and
altogether
went
over
to
aneta
side
where
should
i
be
what
chance
should
i
have
but
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
to
my
side
i
only
ask
you
to
be
neutral
merry
will
you
promise
you
distress
me
more
than
i
can
say
replied
merry
i
feel
so
completely
in
the
dark
i
do
of
course
want
to
take
any
side
ah
then
you
will
promise
said
maggie
i
do
know
what
to
say
let
me
present
a
picture
to
you
continued
maggie
there
are
two
girls
they
are
not
equally
equipped
for
the
battle
of
life
i
say
nothing
of
injustice
in
the
matter
i
only
state
a
fact
one
of
them
is
rich
and
highly
born
and
endowed
with
remarkable
beauty
of
face
that
girl
is
your
own
cousin
aneta
lysle
then
there
is
the
other
girl
maggie
howland
who
is
ugly
oh
no
no
said
merry
affectionately
yes
darling
said
maggie
using
her
most
magnetic
voice
really
ugly
not
in
my
eyes
said
merry
she
is
ugly
repeated
maggie
speaking
with
great
calm
and
yes
she
is
poor
i
will
tell
you
as
a
great
secret
i
have
never
breathed
it
to
a
soul
yet
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
this
girl
to
be
an
inmate
of
aylmer
house
if
ward
in
the
kindness
of
her
great
heart
had
not
offered
her
very
special
terms
you
will
never
breathe
that
merry
not
even
to
cicely
oh
poor
maggie
said
merry
are
you
really
really
as
poor
as
that
church
mice
are
poorer
said
maggie
but
never
mind
i
have
got
something
which
even
your
aneta
has
got
i
have
talent
and
i
have
the
power
the
power
of
charming
i
want
most
earnestly
to
be
your
special
friend
merry
i
have
a
very
affectionate
heart
and
i
love
you
and
cicely
and
molly
and
isabel
more
than
i
can
say
but
of
all
you
four
girls
i
love
you
the
best
you
come
first
in
my
heart
and
to
see
you
at
my
school
turning
away
from
me
and
going
altogether
to
aneta
side
would
give
me
agony
there
i
ca
help
it
forgive
me
i
be
all
right
in
a
minute
maggie
turned
her
face
aside
she
had
taken
out
her
handkerchief
and
was
pressing
it
to
her
eyes
real
tears
had
filled
them
for
her
emotions
were
genuine
enough
do
you
think
she
said
after
a
pause
that
you
who
are
so
rich
in
this
world
goods
might
be
kind
and
loving
to
a
poor
little
plain
girl
who
loves
you
but
who
has
got
very
little
indeed
indeed
i
shall
always
love
you
dear
maggie
said
merry
then
you
will
do
what
i
want
i
do
like
to
make
promises
and
i
am
so
much
in
the
dark
but
i
can
certainly
say
this
that
whatever
happens
i
shall
be
your
friend
at
school
i
shall
look
to
you
to
help
me
in
a
hundred
ways
will
you
indeed
darling
merry
of
course
i
shall
i
always
intended
to
and
i
think
cicely
will
do
just
the
same
i
do
want
you
to
talk
to
cicely
about
this
she
does
care
for
me
as
much
as
you
do
perhaps
not
quite
said
honest
merry
oh
i
am
sure
certain
of
it
then
you
will
be
my
friend
as
i
shall
be
yours
and
when
we
meet
at
aylmer
house
you
will
talk
of
me
to
others
as
your
friend
of
course
i
shall
that
what
i
require
the
thought
of
your
friendship
when
i
love
you
so
passionately
makes
sunshine
in
my
heart
i
be
miserable
at
all
after
what
you
have
said
i
shall
think
of
our
pleasant
talk
under
this
great
i
shall
recall
this
lovely
perfect
day
merry
you
have
made
me
very
happy
but
please
understand
said
merry
that
although
i
am
your
friend
i
can
not
give
up
aneta
certainly
not
dear
only
do
take
what
you
call
sides
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
suppose
that
girls
who
have
only
just
come
to
school
would
prefer
to
be
there
at
first
quite
free
and
untrammeled
and
to
belong
to
a
certain
set
immediately
trammels
you
well
i
for
one
will
promise
at
any
rate
at
first
that
i
belong
to
any
set
said
merry
now
are
you
satisfied
maggie
oh
truly
i
am
do
let
me
kiss
you
darling
the
girls
kissed
very
affectionately
then
maggie
said
now
i
am
quite
happy
after
a
pause
she
continued
as
though
it
were
an
of
course
you
wo
speak
of
this
to
any
one
unless
perhaps
to
cicely
said
merry
no
not
even
to
cicely
for
if
you
found
it
hard
to
understand
she
would
find
it
impossible
but
said
merry
i
never
had
a
secret
from
her
in
my
life
she
is
my
twin
you
know
please
please
said
maggie
keep
this
little
secret
all
to
yourself
for
my
sake
oh
do
think
how
important
it
is
to
me
and
how
much
more
you
have
to
be
thankful
for
than
i
have
if
you
feel
it
like
that
poor
maggie
said
merry
i
will
keep
it
as
my
own
secret
then
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
maggie
sprang
to
her
feet
there
are
the
boys
running
to
meet
us
she
said
i
know
want
my
help
in
preparing
the
fire
for
the
and
i
will
join
the
others
there
susan
heathfield
she
is
all
alone
said
merry
but
one
moment
first
please
maggie
are
you
going
to
make
molly
and
isabel
bind
themselves
by
the
same
promise
dear
me
no
said
maggie
they
will
naturally
be
my
friends
without
any
effort
but
you
are
the
one
i
want
for
you
are
the
one
i
truly
love
hallo
there
you
are
called
andrew
voice
hobnobbing
as
usual
with
merry
cardew
i
say
merry
cried
jack
it
is
unfair
of
you
to
take
our
maggie
away
on
her
last
day
the
two
boys
now
rushed
up
i
am
going
to
cry
said
andrew
and
although
i
am
a
boy
about
to
be
a
man
i
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
it
i
beat
you
at
that
said
jackdaw
for
i
cry
dear
me
boys
how
horrid
of
you
said
maggie
what
on
earth
good
will
crying
do
to
me
and
you
both
be
so
horribly
limp
and
damp
after
it
well
come
now
said
jackdaw
pulling
her
by
one
arm
while
peterkin
secured
the
you
had
your
share
of
her
merry
and
it
our
turn
maggie
and
her
devoted
satellites
went
off
in
the
direction
where
the
bonfire
was
to
be
made
and
merry
walking
slowly
joined
susan
heathfield
susan
was
more
than
two
years
older
than
merry
and
on
that
account
the
younger
girls
looked
up
to
her
with
a
great
deal
of
respect
up
to
the
present
however
they
had
had
no
confidential
talk
susan
now
said
so
you
are
to
be
a
schoolgirl
after
all
yes
is
it
jolly
said
merry
oh
it
has
its
pros
and
cons
replied
susan
in
one
sense
there
is
no
place
like
school
but
in
the
best
sense
of
all
there
is
no
place
like
home
were
you
long
at
school
susan
of
course
mary
and
i
went
to
a
school
in
devonshire
when
we
were
quite
little
girls
i
was
eleven
and
mary
ten
afterwards
we
were
at
a
london
school
and
then
we
went
to
paris
we
had
an
excellent
time
at
all
our
schools
but
i
think
the
best
fun
of
all
was
the
thought
of
the
holidays
and
coming
home
again
that
must
be
delightful
said
merry
did
you
make
many
friends
at
school
well
of
course
said
susan
but
now
let
me
give
you
a
word
of
advice
merry
you
are
going
to
a
most
delightful
school
which
alas
we
were
not
lucky
enough
to
get
admitted
to
although
mother
tried
very
hard
it
may
be
different
at
aylmer
house
from
what
it
is
in
the
ordinary
school
but
i
would
strongly
advise
you
and
cicely
not
to
join
any
clique
at
school
oh
dear
how
very
queer
said
merry
and
she
reddened
deeply
why
do
you
look
like
that
said
susan
nothing
nothing
said
merry
susan
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
said
that
a
girl
what
girl
said
merry
indignantly
i
think
you
said
her
name
was
howland
miss
howland
she
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
girls
i
know
replied
merry
at
once
well
i
do
know
her
you
see
so
i
ca
say
aneta
tells
me
that
she
is
a
member
of
your
school
yes
and
i
am
so
delighted
said
merry
again
susan
heathfield
was
silent
feeling
a
little
puzzled
but
merry
quickly
changed
the
conversation
for
she
did
not
want
to
have
any
more
talk
with
regard
to
maggie
howland
merry
however
had
a
very
transparent
face
her
conversation
with
her
friend
had
left
traces
of
anxiety
and
even
slight
apprehension
on
her
sweet
open
face
merry
cardew
was
oppressed
by
the
first
secret
of
her
life
and
it
is
perhaps
to
be
regretted
or
perhaps
the
reverse
that
she
found
it
almost
impossible
to
keep
a
secret
well
cicely
said
to
her
as
they
were
hurrying
from
the
shady
woods
in
the
direction
of
the
what
is
wrong
with
you
merry
have
you
a
headache
oh
no
i
am
perfectly
all
right
said
merry
brightening
up
only
well
to
say
the
truth
i
am
sorry
that
maggie
is
going
you
are
very
fond
of
her
are
you
said
cicely
well
yes
that
is
it
i
am
said
merry
we
see
plenty
of
her
at
school
anyway
said
cicely
i
wish
she
were
rich
said
merry
i
hate
to
think
of
her
as
poor
is
she
poor
asked
cicely
oh
yes
she
was
just
telling
me
poor
darling
i
do
understand
what
it
means
to
be
poor
said
cicely
people
say
it
is
very
bad
but
somehow
i
ca
take
it
in
maggie
takes
it
in
at
any
rate
said
merry
think
of
us
cicely
having
more
fun
being
out
again
in
the
open
air
having
pleasant
companions
all
round
us
and
our
beautiful
home
to
go
back
to
and
our
parents
whom
we
love
so
dearly
and
then
next
week
of
the
house
by
the
sea
and
aneta
and
molly
and
isabel
our
companions
well
of
course
said
cicely
and
then
think
of
poor
maggie
continued
merry
she
be
shut
up
in
a
musty
fusty
london
lodging
i
ca
think
how
she
endures
it
i
do
know
what
a
musty
fusty
lodging
is
said
cicely
but
she
could
have
come
with
us
because
mother
invited
her
she
ca
because
her
own
mother
wants
her
oh
dear
i
wish
we
could
have
her
and
her
mother
too
come
on
now
merry
i
do
think
we
ought
to
ask
father
and
mother
to
invite
mrs
howland
of
course
not
i
quite
understand
that
replied
merry
nevertheless
i
am
a
little
sad
about
dear
maggie
merry
sadness
took
a
practical
form
she
thought
a
great
deal
about
her
friend
during
the
rest
of
that
day
although
maggie
rather
avoided
her
she
thought
in
particular
of
maggie
poverty
and
wondered
what
poverty
really
meant
the
poor
people
those
who
were
called
poor
at
meredith
did
not
really
suffer
at
all
for
it
was
the
bounden
duty
of
the
squire
of
the
manor
to
see
to
all
their
wants
to
provide
them
with
comfortable
houses
and
nice
gardens
and
if
they
were
ill
to
give
them
the
advice
of
a
good
doctor
also
to
send
them
nourishing
food
from
the
manor
but
poor
people
of
that
sort
were
quite
different
from
the
maggie
howland
sort
merry
could
not
imagine
any
lord
of
the
manor
taking
maggie
and
howland
in
hand
and
providing
them
with
all
the
good
things
of
life
but
all
of
a
sudden
it
darted
through
her
eager
affectionate
little
heart
that
she
herself
might
be
lord
of
the
manor
to
maggie
and
might
help
maggie
out
of
her
own
abundance
if
it
were
impossible
to
get
maggie
howland
and
her
mother
both
invited
to
scarborough
why
should
not
she
merry
provide
maggie
with
means
to
take
her
mother
from
the
fusty
dusty
lodgings
to
another
seaside
resort
merry
thought
over
this
for
some
time
and
the
more
she
thought
over
it
the
more
enamored
she
was
of
the
idea
she
and
cicely
had
of
course
no
special
means
of
their
own
nor
could
they
have
until
they
came
of
age
nevertheless
they
were
allowed
as
ten
pounds
every
quarter
now
merry
ten
pounds
would
be
due
in
a
week
she
really
did
not
want
it
when
she
got
it
she
spent
it
mostly
on
presents
for
her
friends
and
little
gifts
for
the
villagers
but
on
this
occasion
she
might
give
it
all
in
one
lump
sum
to
maggie
howland
surely
her
father
would
let
her
have
it
she
might
give
it
to
maggie
early
morning
maggie
would
not
be
too
proud
to
accept
it
just
as
a
tiny
present
merry
had
as
little
idea
how
far
ten
pounds
would
go
toward
the
expenses
of
a
visit
to
the
seaside
as
she
had
of
what
real
poverty
meant
but
it
occurred
to
her
as
a
delightful
way
of
assuring
maggie
of
her
friendship
to
present
maggie
with
her
quarter
on
their
way
home
that
evening
therefore
she
was
only
too
glad
to
find
herself
by
her
father
side
well
little
girl
he
said
so
you
forsaking
all
your
young
companions
and
wish
to
sit
close
to
the
old
dad
the
old
dad
it
may
be
mentioned
was
driving
home
in
a
from
the
picnic
and
merry
found
herself
perched
high
up
beside
him
as
he
held
the
reins
and
guided
a
pair
of
thoroughbred
horses
well
what
is
it
little
girl
he
said
i
wonder
father
if
you
be
most
frightfully
kind
what
he
answered
just
glancing
at
her
that
means
that
you
are
discontented
again
what
more
can
i
do
for
you
merry
if
i
might
only
have
my
you
extravagant
child
your
it
is
due
for
a
week
but
i
do
want
it
very
specially
will
you
advance
it
to
me
just
this
once
dad
i
am
not
to
know
why
you
want
it
no
dad
darling
you
are
not
to
know
cardew
considered
for
a
minute
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
be
a
really
extravagant
woman
merry
he
said
to
tell
the
truth
i
hate
extravagance
although
i
equally
hate
stinginess
you
will
have
no
lack
of
money
child
but
money
is
a
great
and
wonderful
gift
and
ought
to
be
used
to
the
best
of
best
advantages
it
ought
never
to
be
wasted
for
there
are
so
many
people
who
have
half
enough
and
those
who
are
rich
my
child
ought
to
help
those
who
are
not
rich
yes
darling
father
said
merry
and
that
is
what
i
should
so
awfully
like
to
do
well
i
think
you
have
the
root
of
the
matter
in
you
said
cardew
and
i
for
one
am
the
last
person
to
pry
on
my
child
does
cicely
also
want
her
money
in
advance
oh
no
no
i
want
it
for
a
very
special
reason
very
well
my
little
girl
come
to
me
in
the
study
before
you
go
to
bed
and
you
shall
have
your
money
in
sovereigns
please
father
yes
child
in
sovereigns
thank
you
ever
so
much
darling
during
the
rest
of
the
drive
there
was
no
girl
happier
than
merry
cardew
cardew
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
and
wondered
what
all
this
meant
but
he
was
not
going
to
question
her
when
they
got
home
he
took
her
away
to
his
study
and
opening
a
drawer
took
out
ten
sovereigns
i
may
as
well
tell
you
he
said
as
he
put
them
into
her
hand
that
when
you
go
to
school
i
shall
raise
your
allowance
to
fifteen
pounds
a
quarter
that
is
quite
as
large
a
sum
as
a
girl
of
your
age
ought
to
have
in
the
year
i
do
this
because
i
well
understand
that
at
ward
school
there
will
be
special
opportunities
for
you
to
act
in
a
philanthropic
manner
oh
thank
you
thank
you
father
said
merry
chapter
xii
shepherd
bush
while
merry
was
in
a
state
of
high
rejoicing
at
this
simple
means
of
helping
her
friend
maggie
howland
herself
was
not
having
quite
such
a
good
time
she
had
been
much
relieved
by
her
conversation
with
merry
but
shortly
after
the
aneta
had
come
up
to
her
would
you
like
to
walk
with
me
said
aneta
as
far
as
the
giant
oak
it
is
a
great
distance
from
here
and
i
not
keep
you
long
certainly
i
will
come
with
you
aneta
said
maggie
but
she
felt
uncomfortable
and
wondered
what
it
meant
the
two
girls
set
off
together
they
made
a
contrast
which
must
have
been
discernible
to
the
eyes
of
all
those
who
saw
them
aneta
the
very
essence
of
elegance
maggie
spotlessly
neat
but
compared
to
her
companion
downright
plain
aneta
was
tall
and
slim
maggie
was
short
nevertheless
her
figure
was
her
good
point
and
she
made
the
most
of
it
by
having
perfectly
fitting
clothes
this
very
fact
however
took
somewhat
from
her
appearance
and
gave
her
the
look
of
a
girl
whereas
she
was
still
only
a
child
as
soon
as
ever
the
girls
got
out
of
earshot
aneta
turned
to
maggie
and
said
gravely
my
cousins
the
cardews
are
to
join
us
all
at
aylmer
house
in
september
maggie
longed
to
say
thank
you
for
nothing
but
she
never
dared
to
show
rudeness
to
aneta
no
one
had
ever
been
rude
to
the
stately
young
lady
yes
she
said
then
she
added
i
am
so
glad
are
you
for
some
reasons
i
am
very
glad
said
aneta
but
surely
for
all
are
you
not
for
all
replied
aneta
how
maggie
longed
to
give
her
companion
a
fierce
push
or
otherwise
show
how
she
detested
her
i
will
tell
you
why
i
regret
it
said
aneta
turning
her
calm
beautiful
eyes
upon
maggie
face
thank
you
said
maggie
i
regret
it
maggie
howland
because
you
are
at
the
school
how
very
polite
said
maggie
turning
crimson
it
is
not
polite
said
aneta
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
to
speak
as
i
do
but
it
is
necessary
we
need
go
into
particulars
but
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
please
understand
that
what
i
say
i
mean
you
know
that
when
first
you
came
to
the
school
i
was
as
anxious
as
any
one
else
to
be
kind
to
you
to
help
you
to
be
good
to
you
you
know
the
reason
why
i
changed
my
mind
you
know
what
you
did
you
know
that
were
ward
to
have
the
slightest
inkling
of
what
really
occurred
you
would
not
remain
another
hour
at
aylmer
house
i
told
any
one
what
i
know
but
if
you
maggie
tamper
with
cicely
and
merry
cardew
who
are
my
cousins
and
dear
friends
if
you
win
them
over
to
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
your
side
of
the
school
i
shall
consider
it
my
duty
to
tell
ward
what
i
have
hitherto
kept
back
from
her
maggie
was
trembling
very
violently
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
she
said
after
a
pause
i
have
long
thought
continued
aneta
speaking
in
her
calm
gentle
voice
that
i
did
wrong
at
the
time
to
keep
silent
but
you
got
my
promise
and
i
kept
it
yes
yes
said
maggie
i
got
your
promise
you
would
dare
to
break
it
you
are
mistaken
said
aneta
if
the
circumstances
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
should
arise
i
would
break
that
promise
now
you
understand
i
think
you
are
the
meanest
the
cruellest
i
think
you
are
there
i
hate
you
said
maggie
you
have
no
reason
to
i
will
not
interfere
with
you
if
you
on
your
part
leave
those
i
love
alone
cicely
and
merry
are
coming
to
the
school
because
i
am
there
because
my
aunt
recommends
the
school
because
it
is
a
good
school
leave
off
doing
wrong
and
join
us
maggie
in
what
is
noble
and
high
but
continue
your
present
course
at
your
peril
you
would
do
anything
for
power
you
go
too
far
you
have
influenced
one
or
two
girls
adversely
already
i
am
convinced
that
ward
does
not
trust
you
if
you
interfere
with
cicely
or
merry
ward
will
have
good
reason
to
dislike
you
for
i
myself
shall
open
her
eyes
you
will
be
an
informer
a
you
can
call
me
any
names
you
like
maggie
i
shall
simply
do
what
i
consider
my
duty
oh
but
i
hate
you
said
maggie
again
i
am
sorry
you
hate
me
for
it
is
necessary
and
if
i
saw
you
in
the
least
like
others
i
should
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
now
will
you
give
me
your
promise
that
you
wo
interfere
with
cicely
and
merry
but
does
this
mean
does
this
mean
said
maggie
who
was
almost
choking
with
rage
that
i
am
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
cardews
you
are
on
no
account
to
draw
the
cardews
into
the
circle
of
your
friends
who
are
i
am
thankful
to
say
limited
if
you
do
you
know
the
consequences
and
i
am
not
the
sort
of
girl
to
go
back
when
i
have
firmly
made
up
my
mind
on
a
certain
point
maggie
suddenly
clutched
hold
of
her
companion
arm
i
am
miserable
enough
already
she
said
and
you
make
my
life
unendurable
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
mother
like
mine
and
to
be
starvingly
poor
i
am
very
sorry
you
are
poor
maggie
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
with
regard
to
your
mother
although
i
do
not
think
you
ought
to
speak
unkindly
of
her
but
your
father
was
a
very
good
man
and
you
might
live
up
to
his
memory
i
saw
you
and
merry
together
beware
how
you
try
to
influence
her
oh
i
ca
stand
you
said
maggie
i
have
said
my
say
shall
we
return
to
the
others
said
aneta
in
her
calm
voice
if
she
would
only
get
into
a
rage
and
we
might
have
a
fight
i
should
feel
better
thought
maggie
but
she
was
seriously
alarmed
for
she
well
remembered
something
which
had
happened
at
school
which
aneta
had
discovered
and
which
if
known
would
force
ward
to
dismiss
her
from
the
establishment
such
a
course
would
spell
ruin
maggie
had
strong
feelings
but
she
had
also
and
by
the
time
the
two
joined
the
others
her
face
looked
much
as
usual
on
the
following
morning
early
a
little
girl
ran
swiftly
from
the
manor
to
the
rectory
maggie
was
to
leave
by
the
eleven
train
merry
appeared
on
the
scene
soon
after
nine
i
want
you
maggie
all
quite
by
yourself
said
merry
speaking
with
such
excitement
that
molly
and
belle
looked
at
her
in
unbounded
amazement
you
ca
keep
her
long
said
peterkins
and
jackdaw
for
it
is
our
very
last
day
and
and
fanciful
want
to
say
to
her
you
ca
have
the
darling
more
than
three
minutes
at
the
most
i
am
going
to
keep
maggie
for
ten
minutes
and
no
come
along
at
once
maggie
said
merry
cardew
they
went
out
into
the
grounds
and
merry
putting
her
hand
into
her
pocket
took
out
a
little
brown
leather
bag
she
thrust
it
into
her
companion
hand
what
is
it
said
maggie
it
is
for
you
for
you
darling
said
merry
take
it
as
a
loan
if
you
like
only
take
it
it
is
only
ten
pounds
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
it
nothing
at
all
but
do
take
it
just
as
a
mere
loan
it
is
my
for
the
next
quarter
perhaps
you
could
go
from
the
musty
fusty
lodgings
to
some
fresher
place
with
this
to
help
you
do
do
take
it
maggie
i
shall
so
love
you
if
you
do
maggie
narrow
eyes
grew
wide
maggie
sallow
face
flushed
there
came
a
wild
commotion
in
her
heart
a
real
genuine
sense
of
downright
love
for
the
girl
who
had
done
this
thing
for
her
and
ten
pounds
which
meant
so
very
little
to
merry
cardew
held
untold
possibilities
for
maggie
you
will
hurt
me
frightfully
if
you
refuse
said
merry
maggie
trembled
from
head
to
foot
suppose
by
any
chance
it
got
to
aneta
ears
that
she
had
taken
this
money
from
merry
suppose
it
got
abroad
in
the
school
oh
she
dared
not
take
it
she
must
not
what
is
it
maggie
why
do
you
speak
said
merry
looking
at
her
in
astonishment
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
said
maggie
but
i
just
ca
take
the
money
oh
maggie
but
why
i
ca
dear
i
ca
it
it
would
not
be
right
you
must
lower
me
in
my
own
estimation
i
should
feel
low
down
if
i
took
your
money
i
know
well
i
am
poor
and
so
is
dear
mother
and
the
lodgings
are
fusty
and
musty
but
we
are
neither
of
us
so
poor
as
that
i
never
forget
that
you
brought
it
to
me
and
i
love
you
just
more
than
i
have
ever
done
but
i
ca
take
it
do
come
on
maggie
shouted
jackdaw
fanciful
is
dying
for
his
breakfast
and
as
to
peterkins
he
has
got
out
of
his
cage
peterkins
is
crying
like
anything
and
his
tears
are
dropping
on
and
does
like
it
do
come
on
yes
yes
i
am
coming
said
maggie
darling
merry
my
best
thanks
and
best
love
that
evening
or
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
maggie
appeared
at
shepherd
bush
she
had
been
obliged
to
travel
and
the
journey
was
hot
and
dusty
she
lay
back
against
the
cushions
with
a
tired
feeling
all
over
her
for
a
time
she
had
been
able
to
forget
her
poverty
now
it
had
fully
returned
to
her
and
she
was
not
in
the
mood
to
be
there
was
no
need
to
show
any
charm
or
any
kindliness
to
her
neighbors
who
in
their
turn
thought
her
a
disagreeable
plain
girl
not
worth
any
special
notice
it
was
therefore
by
no
means
a
girl
who
ran
up
the
high
flight
of
steps
which
belonged
to
that
in
shepherd
bush
where
howland
was
staying
maggie
knew
the
lodgings
well
although
she
had
never
spent
much
time
there
as
a
rule
she
contrived
to
spend
almost
all
her
holidays
with
friends
but
on
this
occasion
her
mother
had
sent
for
her
in
a
very
summary
manner
and
although
maggie
had
no
real
love
for
her
mother
she
was
afraid
to
disobey
her
howland
occupied
the
floor
of
the
said
lodgings
they
were
kept
by
a
ross
an
untidy
and
by
no
means
too
woman
ross
kept
one
small
general
and
the
general
name
was
tildy
tildy
had
hair
and
a
great
many
freckles
on
her
round
face
she
was
squat
in
figure
and
had
a
perpetual
smut
either
on
her
cheek
or
forehead
in
the
morning
she
was
nothing
better
than
a
slavey
but
in
the
afternoon
she
generally
managed
to
put
on
a
cap
with
long
white
streamers
and
an
apron
with
a
bib
tildy
thought
herself
very
fine
in
this
attire
and
she
had
donned
it
now
in
honor
of
miss
howland
arrival
she
had
no
particular
respect
for
howland
but
she
had
a
secret
and
consuming
admiration
for
maggie
maggie
had
been
kind
to
tildy
once
or
twice
and
had
even
given
the
general
a
dress
of
her
own
maggie
was
plain
and
yet
people
liked
her
and
listened
to
her
words
oh
miss
said
tildy
when
she
opened
the
front
door
it
me
glad
to
see
you
your
ma
is
upstairs
she
took
with
a
headache
but
you
find
her
lyin
down
on
the
sofy
in
the
then
i
run
up
at
once
matilda
said
maggie
and
how
are
you
she
added
oh
you
got
your
usual
smut
indicate
the
spot
miss
and
it
shall
be
moved
instancious
said
tildy
seems
to
me
as
if
never
could
get
rid
of
smuts
what
with
the
and
missus
bein
so
exacsheous
and
tildy
here
tildy
there
tildy
do
this
tildy
do
soundin
in
my
hears
all
day
long
you
are
a
very
good
girl
said
maggie
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
have
a
hundred
smuts
not
one
but
take
it
off
now
do
it
on
the
very
center
of
your
forehead
and
bring
me
some
tea
to
the
for
i
ever
so
thirsty
you
been
in
a
blessed
wondrous
castle
since
have
you
missie
said
matilda
in
a
voice
of
suppressed
awe
i
know
some
young
ladies
who
live
in
a
castle
but
i
myself
have
been
at
a
rectory
said
maggie
now
do
keep
me
oh
here
a
shilling
for
the
cabman
give
it
to
him
and
get
my
box
taken
upstairs
maggie
flew
up
the
steep
badly
carpeted
stairs
to
the
hideous
her
spirits
had
been
very
low
but
somehow
tildy
had
managed
to
revive
them
tildy
was
plain
and
very
much
lower
than
maggie
in
the
social
scale
but
tildy
admired
her
and
because
of
that
admiration
made
her
life
more
or
less
endurable
in
the
fusty
musty
lodgings
she
had
always
cultivated
tildy
good
will
and
she
thought
of
the
girl
now
with
a
strange
sense
of
pity
compared
to
her
i
suppose
i
am
well
off
thought
maggie
i
have
only
five
weeks
at
the
most
to
endure
this
misery
then
there
will
be
aylmer
house
she
opened
the
door
and
entered
howland
was
lying
on
a
sofa
which
was
covered
with
faded
rep
and
had
a
broken
spring
she
had
a
handkerchief
wrung
out
of
aromatic
vinegar
over
her
forehead
her
eyes
were
shut
and
her
exceedingly
thin
face
was
very
pale
when
her
daughter
entered
the
room
she
opened
a
pair
of
faded
eyes
and
looked
at
her
but
no
sense
of
pleasure
crossed
howland
shallow
face
on
the
contrary
she
looked
much
worried
and
said
in
a
cross
tone
i
wish
you
would
not
be
so
noisy
maggie
did
tildy
tell
you
that
i
had
an
acute
headache
yes
mother
and
i
did
know
i
was
noisy
replied
maggie
i
came
upstairs
as
softly
as
possible
that
door
she
pointed
to
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
creaks
horribly
that
is
not
my
fault
excusing
yourself
as
usual
said
howland
well
mother
said
maggie
after
a
pause
may
i
kiss
you
now
that
i
have
come
back
against
my
will
i
knew
you
be
horribly
discontented
said
howland
but
of
course
you
may
kiss
me
maggie
bent
down
and
touched
her
mother
cheek
with
her
young
lips
i
was
having
a
beautiful
time
she
said
and
you
do
seem
glad
now
that
i
have
come
back
what
is
the
matter
i
have
something
to
communicate
to
you
said
howland
i
did
not
think
i
could
write
it
therefore
i
was
obliged
to
have
you
with
me
but
we
wo
talk
of
it
for
a
little
have
you
ordered
tea
yes
mother
tildy
is
bringing
it
that
right
said
howland
what
a
hot
day
it
is
she
continued
this
room
is
stifling
replied
maggie
do
you
mind
if
i
pull
down
the
venetian
blinds
that
will
keep
some
of
the
sun
out
the
blinds
are
all
broken
said
howland
i
have
spoken
to
that
woman
ross
till
i
am
tired
but
she
never
will
see
to
my
wishes
in
any
way
i
ca
imagine
why
we
stay
here
mother
oh
do
begin
your
grumbles
now
said
howland
i
have
news
for
you
when
tea
is
over
just
then
the
door
was
opened
by
means
of
a
kick
and
a
bump
and
tildy
entered
weighed
down
by
an
enormous
maggie
ran
to
prepare
a
table
for
its
reception
and
tildy
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
fresh
admiration
howland
raised
herself
and
also
looked
at
the
girl
have
you
kept
the
cakes
downstairs
and
the
muffins
that
i
ordered
and
the
gooseberries
no
um
said
tildy
i
brought
them
up
for
miss
maggie
tea
i
told
you
they
were
not
to
be
touched
till
martin
came
yes
um
said
tildy
but
me
and
ross
thought
as
miss
maggie
want
howland
glanced
at
her
daughter
then
all
of
a
sudden
and
quite
unexpectedly
her
faded
face
grew
red
she
perceived
an
expression
of
inquiry
in
maggie
eyes
which
rather
frightened
her
it
all
right
she
said
now
that
you
brought
the
things
up
tildy
leave
them
here
and
go
when
martin
comes
show
him
up
now
leave
us
and
be
quick
about
it
tildy
departed
slamming
the
door
behind
her
how
noisy
that
girl
is
said
howland
well
i
am
better
now
i
just
go
into
our
bedroom
and
get
tidy
i
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
i
must
be
seen
looking
this
fright
when
martin
comes
but
who
is
mr
martin
said
maggie
you
will
know
presently
said
howland
it
about
him
that
i
have
news
maggie
felt
her
heart
thumping
in
a
very
uncomfortable
manner
the
bedroom
which
she
and
her
mother
shared
together
that
is
when
maggie
was
with
her
mother
was
at
the
back
of
the
howland
remained
there
for
about
five
minutes
and
during
that
time
maggie
helped
herself
to
a
cup
of
tea
for
she
was
feverishly
hot
and
thirsty
her
mother
returned
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
looking
wonderfully
better
and
in
fact
quite
rejuvenated
her
dress
was
fairly
neat
she
had
a
slight
color
in
her
pale
cheeks
which
considerably
brightened
her
eyes
her
faded
hair
was
arranged
with
some
neatness
and
she
had
put
on
a
white
blouse
and
a
blue
alpaca
skirt
oh
mother
said
maggie
hailing
this
change
with
great
relief
how
much
better
you
look
now
i
am
a
comfort
to
you
am
i
not
mums
i
mind
coming
back
and
giving
up
all
my
fun
if
i
am
a
real
comfort
to
you
i
would
have
sent
for
you
but
for
martin
said
howland
it
was
he
who
wished
it
yes
i
am
much
better
now
though
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
you
are
the
cause
it
the
thought
of
seeing
martin
that
cheers
me
up
i
must
be
tidy
for
him
yes
you
may
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
for
me
only
see
that
you
keep
some
really
strong
tea
in
the
teapot
for
martin
for
he
can
not
bear
it
weak
he
calls
weak
tea
but
whoever
is
this
mysterious
person
said
maggie
i
will
tell
you
in
a
minute
or
two
you
may
give
me
one
of
those
little
cakes
no
i
could
stand
muffins
i
hate
them
in
hot
weather
besides
my
digestion
is
what
it
was
but
i
shall
be
all
right
so
will
you
too
my
dear
and
what
i
do
i
do
for
you
well
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
for
me
and
get
it
over
said
maggie
you
were
always
very
peculiar
mums
always
even
when
dear
father
was
alive
and
you
not
less
so
now
that
a
very
unkind
way
for
a
child
to
speak
of
her
parent
said
howland
but
i
can
assure
you
maggie
that
martin
allow
it
in
the
future
maggie
now
sprang
to
her
feet
good
gracious
mother
what
has
martin
to
do
with
me
is
he
is
he
it
can
not
be
mother
yes
i
can
said
howland
i
may
as
well
have
it
out
first
as
last
i
am
going
to
marry
mr
martin
mother
there
was
a
wailing
cry
in
maggie
voice
no
girl
can
stand
with
equanimity
her
mother
marrying
a
second
time
and
as
maggie
with
all
her
dreams
of
her
own
future
had
never
for
an
instant
contemplated
this
fact
she
was
simply
staggered
for
a
minute
or
two
you
will
have
to
take
it
in
the
right
spirit
my
dear
said
her
mother
i
ca
stand
this
life
any
longer
i
want
money
and
comforts
and
devotion
and
the
love
of
a
faithful
husband
and
martin
will
give
me
all
these
things
he
is
willing
to
adopt
you
too
he
said
so
he
has
no
children
of
his
own
i
mean
when
i
say
that
that
his
first
family
are
all
settled
in
life
and
he
says
that
he
would
object
at
all
to
a
pleasant
lively
girl
in
the
house
he
wants
you
to
leave
school
leave
aylmer
house
said
maggie
oh
no
mother
i
knew
you
make
a
fuss
about
it
said
howland
he
has
a
great
dislike
to
what
he
calls
fine
folks
he
speaks
of
them
as
daisies
and
he
hates
daisies
but
mother
mother
dear
before
he
comes
tell
me
something
about
him
where
did
you
meet
him
who
is
he
a
clergyman
a
barrister
what
is
he
mother
howland
remained
silent
for
a
minute
then
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
heart
then
she
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
hysterical
laughter
just
consider
for
a
minute
maggie
she
said
what
utter
nonsense
you
are
talking
where
should
i
be
likely
to
meet
a
clergyman
or
a
barrister
do
clergymen
or
barristers
or
people
in
any
profession
come
to
houses
like
this
do
talk
sense
when
you
about
it
well
tell
me
what
he
is
at
least
he
is
in
i
am
by
no
means
ashamed
of
it
in
now
it
so
happened
that
it
had
been
duly
impressed
upon
maggie
mind
that
cardew
of
meredith
manor
was
also
so
to
speak
in
trade
that
is
he
was
the
sleeping
partner
in
one
of
the
largest
and
wealthiest
businesses
in
london
maggie
therefore
for
a
minute
had
a
glittering
vision
of
a
great
equal
in
splendor
to
meredith
manor
where
she
and
her
mother
could
live
together
but
the
next
minute
howland
killed
these
glowing
hopes
even
in
the
moment
of
their
birth
i
want
to
conceal
nothing
from
you
she
said
martin
keeps
the
grocer
shop
at
the
corner
i
may
as
well
say
that
i
met
him
when
i
went
to
that
shop
to
get
the
small
articles
of
grocery
which
i
required
for
my
own
consumption
he
has
served
me
often
across
the
counter
then
one
day
i
was
taken
rather
weak
and
ill
in
the
shop
and
he
took
me
into
his
a
very
comfortable
room
and
gave
me
a
glass
of
excellent
old
port
and
since
then
somehow
we
have
been
friends
he
is
a
widower
i
a
widow
his
children
have
gone
into
the
world
and
each
one
of
them
is
doing
well
my
child
is
seldom
or
never
with
her
mother
it
is
about
a
week
ago
since
he
asked
me
if
i
would
accept
him
and
plenty
instead
of
staying
as
i
am
a
genteel
widow
with
so
little
money
that
i
am
his
only
objection
to
our
marriage
is
the
thought
of
you
maggie
for
he
said
that
i
was
bringing
you
up
as
a
fine
lady
with
no
provision
whatever
for
the
future
he
hates
fine
ladies
as
he
calls
them
in
fact
he
is
dead
nuts
against
the
aristocracy
oh
mother
wailed
poor
maggie
and
my
father
was
a
gentleman
martin
has
quite
a
gentlemanly
heart
said
howland
i
do
pretend
for
a
moment
that
he
is
in
the
same
position
as
my
late
lamented
husband
but
he
is
ten
times
better
off
and
we
shall
live
in
a
nice
little
house
in
clapham
and
i
can
have
two
servants
of
my
own
he
is
having
the
house
refurnished
and
repapered
for
me
in
his
own
taste
it
is
true
for
he
will
not
hear
of
what
he
calls
liberty
rubbish
but
it
is
going
to
be
very
comfortable
and
i
look
forward
to
my
change
of
surroundings
with
great
satisfaction
yes
mother
said
maggie
you
always
did
think
of
yourself
first
but
what
about
me
you
had
better
not
talk
to
me
in
that
strain
before
martin
he
is
very
deeply
devoted
to
me
said
howland
and
do
not
imagine
that
we
have
not
given
you
careful
consideration
he
is
willing
to
adopt
you
but
insists
on
your
leaving
aylmer
house
and
coming
to
laburnum
villa
at
clapham
from
what
he
says
you
are
quite
sufficiently
educated
and
your
duty
now
is
to
look
after
your
mother
and
your
new
father
to
be
pleasant
to
me
all
day
long
and
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
with
him
when
he
comes
back
from
business
in
the
evening
if
you
play
your
cards
well
maggie
he
will
leave
you
well
provided
for
as
he
is
quite
rich
of
course
not
rich
like
those
people
you
are
staying
near
but
rich
for
his
class
i
am
very
much
pleased
myself
at
the
engagement
our
banns
were
called
last
sunday
in
church
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
a
fortnight
after
that
you
had
best
stay
on
here
until
we
desire
you
to
join
us
at
laburnum
villa
i
ca
mother
said
maggie
i
ca
and
i
wo
oh
come
i
hear
a
step
on
the
stairs
said
howland
that
is
martin
now
you
will
restrain
yourself
for
my
sake
there
a
step
on
the
stairs
firm
solid
heavy
the
door
was
opened
about
an
inch
but
no
one
came
in
howland
said
in
a
low
whisper
to
her
daughter
he
does
know
you
have
returned
he
is
very
playful
just
stay
quiet
he
really
is
a
most
amusing
person
said
a
voice
at
the
door
and
a
round
shining
bald
head
was
popped
in
and
then
disappeared
said
howland
in
response
she
stood
up
and
there
came
over
her
faded
face
a
waggish
expression
she
held
up
her
finger
and
shook
it
playfully
the
bald
head
appeared
again
followed
immediately
by
a
very
round
body
the
playful
finger
continued
to
waggle
ducksie
dear
said
martin
and
he
clasped
howland
in
his
arms
maggie
gave
a
smothered
groan
it
the
child
said
howland
in
a
whisper
she
is
a
bit
upset
but
when
she
knows
you
james
she
love
you
as
much
as
i
do
hope
so
said
martin
i
a
duckle
ai
i
victoria
here
he
chuckled
the
good
lady
under
the
chin
ah
and
so
this
is
maggie
how
do
my
dear
how
do
how
do
you
do
said
maggie
come
come
said
martin
no
flights
and
vapors
no
fine
airs
no
affected
mincing
ways
a
little
girl
should
love
her
new
parent
a
little
girl
should
kiss
her
new
parent
i
wo
kiss
you
martin
said
maggie
oh
come
come
shy
is
she
let
me
tell
you
that
every
man
would
want
to
kiss
she
is
not
a
bit
like
you
my
dear
victoria
wherever
did
she
get
that
queer
little
face
she
is
no
beauty
and
that
i
will
now
your
mother
popsy
is
a
most
elegant
woman
any
one
can
see
that
she
is
a
born
aristocrat
but
i
hate
my
dear
hate
i
am
one
of
those
who
vote
for
the
abolition
of
the
house
of
lords
give
me
the
commons
no
bloated
lords
for
me
well
you
a
bit
took
aback
ai
you
your
mother
and
me
we
settled
things
up
very
tidy
while
you
were
sporting
in
the
country
i
like
you
all
the
better
my
dear
for
being
plain
i
want
no
beauties
except
my
beloved
victoria
she
the
woman
for
ai
you
my
eh
dear
eh
dear
it
we
three
have
the
i
take
you
right
into
my
heart
and
snug
and
comfortable
you
find
yourself
there
poor
maggie
the
overwhelming
contrast
between
this
scene
and
the
scenes
of
yesterday
the
awful
fact
that
her
mother
was
going
to
marry
such
a
being
as
martin
overpowered
her
with
such
a
sense
of
horror
that
for
the
time
she
felt
quite
dumb
and
stupid
martin
however
was
in
a
radiant
humor
now
then
he
said
addressing
howland
where
the
tea
poor
wants
his
tea
he
hungry
and
he
thirsty
is
will
pour
out
tea
with
her
own
pretty
elegant
hands
and
butter
his
muffins
for
him
and
in
the
corner
can
keep
herself
quiet
may
i
go
into
our
bedroom
mother
said
maggie
at
that
juncture
no
miss
you
may
not
said
martin
suddenly
rousing
himself
from
a
very
comfortable
position
in
the
only
the
room
afforded
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
when
i
have
said
it
you
may
do
what
you
please
stay
quiet
dear
maggie
for
the
present
said
howland
the
poor
woman
felt
a
queer
sense
of
shame
and
had
quite
an
agreeable
time
together
when
they
were
alone
she
did
not
mind
the
boisterous
attentions
of
her
present
swain
but
with
maggie
by
there
seemed
to
be
a
difference
maggie
made
her
ashamed
of
herself
maggie
walked
to
the
window
and
taking
a
low
chair
sat
down
her
heart
was
beating
heavily
there
was
such
a
misery
within
her
that
she
could
scarcely
contain
herself
could
anything
be
done
to
rescue
her
mother
from
such
a
marriage
she
was
a
very
clever
girl
but
clever
as
she
was
she
could
see
no
way
out
meanwhile
martin
drank
his
tea
with
huge
gulps
ate
a
quantity
of
muffins
the
gooseberries
as
not
worth
his
attention
and
then
said
now
victoria
my
dearest
dear
i
am
ready
to
propound
my
scheme
to
your
come
forward
and
listen
to
what
new
pa
intends
to
do
for
you
maggie
rose
feeling
that
her
limbs
were
turned
to
ice
she
crossed
the
room
and
stood
before
martin
well
she
said
none
of
those
airs
popsy
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean
to
do
said
maggie
struggling
hard
to
keep
her
temper
well
missie
miss
poor
means
to
marry
your
good
ma
and
he
wants
a
nice
dirl
to
come
and
live
with
ma
and
pa
at
clapham
pretty
house
solid
furniture
garden
stocked
with
a
swing
for
good
dirl
a
nice
room
for
dear
popsy
to
sleep
in
no
more
lessons
no
more
fuss
no
more
poverty
that
what
new
pa
proposes
to
ma
dirl
what
does
dirl
say
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
howland
looked
with
wild
apprehension
at
her
daughter
martin
had
however
still
a
jovial
and
smiling
face
down
on
its
knees
ought
to
go
he
said
tears
might
come
in
eyes
and
the
dirl
might
say
pa
that
is
to
be
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
i
am
glad
that
going
to
marry
ma
and
to
take
me
from
horrid
school
but
there
was
no
sign
on
the
part
of
maggie
howland
of
fulfilling
these
expectations
on
the
part
of
the
new
on
the
contrary
she
stood
upright
and
then
said
in
a
low
voice
this
has
been
a
very
great
shock
to
me
shock
cried
martin
what
do
you
mean
by
that
miss
i
must
speak
said
maggie
you
must
let
me
sir
and
mother
you
must
let
me
it
is
for
the
last
time
quite
the
last
time
i
will
never
be
here
to
offend
you
any
more
my
word
said
martin
springing
to
his
feet
and
his
red
face
growing
crimson
there
gratitude
for
you
manners
for
you
ma
how
ever
did
you
bring
her
up
let
me
speak
said
maggie
i
am
sorry
to
hurt
your
feelings
sir
you
are
engaged
to
my
mother
said
martin
my
pretty
birdling
hopped
so
to
speak
into
my
arms
no
difficulties
with
her
no
drawing
back
on
the
part
of
she
wanted
her
and
she
well
her
wanted
her
yes
sir
said
maggie
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
bitterly
sorry
that
my
mother
is
going
to
marry
again
but
as
she
cares
for
you
which
i
said
howland
who
was
now
reduced
to
tears
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
continued
maggie
except
that
i
hope
she
will
be
happy
but
i
sir
am
my
father
daughter
as
well
as
my
mother
and
i
can
not
for
a
single
moment
accept
your
offer
it
is
impossible
i
must
go
on
with
my
own
education
as
best
i
can
then
you
said
martin
to
join
your
mother
and
me
yes
said
maggie
i
refuse
has
she
anything
to
live
on
ma
asked
martin
oh
dear
james
said
howland
do
take
all
the
poor
child
says
in
earnest
now
she
be
down
on
her
knees
to
you
i
know
she
will
leave
her
to
me
james
dear
and
i
manage
her
you
can
manage
most
things
said
martin
but
i
do
know
that
i
want
that
insolent
piece
she
is
very
different
from
you
if
she
is
to
be
about
our
pleasant
cheerful
home
snubbing
me
and
putting
on
airs
why
i
have
none
of
it
let
her
go
victoria
i
say
let
her
go
if
she
wants
to
but
if
she
comes
to
me
she
must
come
in
a
cheerful
spirit
and
joke
with
me
and
take
my
fun
and
be
as
agreeable
as
you
are
yourself
well
at
least
said
howland
give
us
till
the
child
is
surprised
she
will
be
different
i
hope
so
said
martin
but
if
there
any
philandering
or
falling
back
or
if
there
any
i
have
naught
to
do
with
her
i
only
take
her
to
oblige
you
victoria
you
had
best
leave
us
now
dear
said
howland
i
will
talk
to
maggie
and
let
you
know
martin
sat
quite
still
for
a
minute
then
he
rose
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
maggie
but
motioning
howland
to
follow
him
performed
a
sort
of
out
of
the
room
when
he
reached
the
door
and
had
said
he
opened
it
again
and
said
pushing
a
little
bit
of
his
bald
head
in
and
then
withdrawing
it
while
howland
pretended
to
admire
his
antics
at
last
he
was
gone
but
by
this
time
maggie
had
vanished
into
the
bedroom
she
had
flung
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
and
pushed
her
handkerchief
against
her
mouth
to
stifle
the
sound
of
her
sobs
howland
gently
opened
the
door
looked
at
her
daughter
and
then
shut
it
again
she
felt
thoroughly
afraid
of
maggie
an
hour
or
two
later
a
pale
girl
came
out
of
the
bedroom
and
sat
down
by
her
mother
well
said
howland
he
is
very
pleasant
and
cheerful
he
mother
he
is
horrible
maggie
you
have
no
right
to
say
those
things
to
me
i
want
a
good
husband
to
take
care
of
me
i
am
very
lonely
and
no
one
appreciates
me
oh
mother
said
poor
maggie
my
father
he
was
a
very
good
man
said
howland
restlessly
but
he
was
above
me
somehow
and
i
never
never
could
reach
up
to
his
heights
and
you
really
tell
me
his
child
that
you
prefer
that
person
i
think
i
shall
be
quite
happy
with
him
said
howland
i
really
do
he
is
awfully
kind
and
his
funny
little
ways
amuse
me
oh
mother

will
be
good
about
it
maggie
wo
you
said
howland
you
wo
destroy
your
poor
mother
happiness

have
had
such
lonely
years
and
such
a
struggle
to
keep
my
head
above
water
and
now
that
good
man
comes
along
and
offers
me
a
home
and
every
comfort
i
am
not
young
dear
i
am
and
there
is
nothing
before
me
if

martin
but

old
age
of
great
poverty
and
terrible
loneliness
you
wo
stand
in
my
way
maggie
i
ca
mother
though
it
gives
me
agony
to
think
of
your
marrying

to
it
after
a
little
and
he
is
really
very
funny

assure
you
he
puts
me
into
fits
of
laughter

thorn

to
do
for

new
father

on
my
keeping
the
very
little
money

my
own
personal
use
and

his
wishes

will
not
allow
me
to
spend
a
farthing
of
it
on
you

all
i
ca
said
maggie
i
do
know
quite
what
to
do

to
be
so
very
cruel
as
to
take
away
the
little
money
you
have
hitherto
spent
on
me

fact

a
headache

place

cool
and
fresh
oh

dear

getting
such
a
sweet
little
bedroom
ready
for
you
i
could
cry
when
i
think
of
your
cross
obstinacy
but
even
the
thought
of
the
sweet
little
bedroom
did
move
maggie
howland
tildy
presently
brought
up
a
meagre
supper
of
which
the
mother
and
daughter
partook
almost
in
silence
then
howland
went
to
her
room
where
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
maggie
had
the
to
herself
she
had
arranged
a
sort
of
extempore
bed
on
the
hard
sofa
and
was
about
to
lie
down
when
tildy
opened
the
door
i
say
said
tildy
ai
he
cunnin
what

maggie

like
then
said
tildy
backing
a
step
and
is
so
enticin
the
prettiest
ways
at
least
that

and
ross
thinks
we
always

on
the
stairs
for
to
greet
your
ma
we
like
that
we

i
have
an
old
dress
in
my
trunk
tildy
which
i
will
give
you
you
can
manage
to
make
it
look
quite
nice
for
your
new
post
as
at
laburnum
villa
but
now
go
please
for
i
must
be
alone
to
think
tildy
went
she
crept
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
regions
there
she
met
ross
the
blessed
young
lady
full
of
ructions
said
tildy
and
no
wonder
replied
ross
she
a
step
above
martin
and
martin
knows
it
i
as
she
wo
refuse
to
jine
us
at
laburnum
villa
said
tildy
there
no
sayin
wot
a
spirited
gel
like
that
do
said
ross
but
ef
she
do
go
down
martin
be
a
match
for
i
do
know
about
that
replied
tildy
she
a
strong
determined
about
has
our
miss
maggie
if
howland
slept
profoundly
poor
maggie
could
not
close
her
eyes
she
suddenly
found
herself
surrounded
by
calamity
the
comparatively
small
trials
which
she
had
thought
big
enough
in
connection
with
aylmer
house
and
cicely
and
merry
cardew
completely
disappeared
before
this
great
trouble
which
now
faced
her
her
mother
income
amounted
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
out
of
that
meagre
sum
the
pair
had
contrived
to
live
and
owing
to
ward
generosity
maggie
had
been
educated
but
now
that
dreadful
martin
had
secured
howland
little
property
and
the
only
condition
on
which
it
could
be
spent
on
maggie
was
that
she
should
accept
a
home
with
her
future
stepfather
this
nothing
whatever
would
induce
her
to
do
but
what
was
to
be
done
she
had
no
compunction
whatever
in
leaving
her
mother
they
had
never
been
really
friends
for
the
girl
took
after
her
father
whom
her
mother
had
never
even
pretended
to
understand
howland
when
she
became
martin
would
be
absolutely
happy
without
maggie
and
maggie
knew
well
that
she
would
be
equally
miserable
with
her
on
the
other
hand
how
was
maggie
to
live
suddenly
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
there
was
a
way
out
or
at
least
a
way
of
providing
sufficient
funds
for
the
coming
term
at
aylmer
house
her
mother
had
after
all
some
sort
of
affection
for
her
and
if
maggie
made
her
request
she
was
certain
it
would
not
be
refused
she
meant
to
get
her
mother
to
give
her
all
that
famous
collection
of
jewels
which
her
father
had
collected
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
especial
the
bracelets
flashed
before
her
memory
these
could
be
sold
and
would
produce
a
sum
which
might
keep
maggie
at
aylmer
house
perhaps
for
a
year
certainly
for
the
approaching
term
chapter
xiii
breakfast
with
after
maggie
restless
night
she
got
up
early
the
day
promised
to
be
even
hotter
than
the
one
before
but
as
the
faced
west
it
was
comparatively
cool
at
this
hour
tildy
brought
her
favorite
young
lady
a
cup
of
tea
and
suggested
that
she
should
go
for
an
outing
while
tildy
herself
freshened
up
the
room
maggie
thought
that
a
good
idea
and
when
she
found
herself
in
the
street
her
spirits
rose
a
trifle
a
curious
sort
of
fascination
drew
her
in
the
direction
of
shop
it
was
a
very
large
corner
shop
had
several
entrances
and
at
this
early
hour
the
young
shopmen
and
shopwomen
were
busy
dressing
the
windows
they
were
putting
appetizing
sweetmeats
and
cakes
and
biscuits
and
all
kinds
of
delectable
things
in
the
different
windows
to
tempt
the
maggie
felt
a
hot
sense
of
burning
shame
rising
to
her
cheeks
as
she
passed
the
shop
she
was
about
to
turn
back
when
whom
should
she
see
standing
in
the
doorway
but
the
prosperous
owner
himself
he
recognized
her
immediately
and
called
out
to
her
in
his
full
pompous
voice
come
along
here
wopsy
the
young
turned
to
gaze
in
some
wonder
as
the
girl
approached
the
fat
man
i
in
a
hurry
back
to
breakfast
with
my
mother
said
maggie
in
her
coldest
voice
well
then
i
will
come
along
with
you
my
dear
i
am
just
in
the
mood
she
will
give
me
breakfast
this
morning
i
be
back
again
in
the
shop
soon
after
nine
it
a
fine
shop
ai
it
popsy
it
does
seem
large
said
maggie
it
the
sort
of
shop
responded
martin
that
takes
a
deal
of
getting
it
not
done
in
a
day
nor
a
month
nor
a
year
it
takes
a
lifetime
to
build
up
premises
like
these
it
means
riches
my
dear
riches
he
rolled
out
the
words
luxuriously
i
am
sure
it
does
said
maggie
who
felt
that
for
her
own
sake
she
must
humor
him
you
think
so
do
you
said
martin
giving
her
a
keen
glance
of
course
i
do
replied
maggie
martin
gazed
at
her
from
head
to
foot
she
was
plain
he
rather
liked
her
for
that
he
admired
her
too
for
as
he
expressed
it
standing
up
to
him
his
dear
would
never
stand
up
to
him
but
this
girl
was
not
the
least
like
her
mother
she
had
a
lot
of
character
had
none
you
make
an
admirable
accountant
popsy
he
said
how
would
you
like
to
take
that
post
in
my
shop
maggie
was
about
to
reply
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
accept
such
a
position
when
a
quick
thought
darted
through
her
mind
she
could
scarcely
hope
to
make
anything
of
her
mother
for
alack
and
alas
howland
was
one
of
those
weak
characters
who
slip
away
from
you
even
as
you
try
to
grasp
them
but
martin
with
his
terrible
vulgarity
and
awful
pleasantry
was
at
least
fairly
strong
martin
said
maggie
then
instead
of
going
in
to
breakfast
with
mother
will
you
take
me
to
some
restaurant
and
give
me
a
good
meal
and
let
me
talk
to
you
well
now
said
martin
chuckling
you
a
girl
you
have
cheek
i
am
not
a
man
to
waste
my
money
and
breakfast
with
wo
cost
me
anything
but
under
the
circumstances
you
will
waste
a
little
money
in
order
to
oblige
me
said
maggie
there
now
i
admire
your
cheek
so
be
it
you
do
deserve
anything
from
me
for
a
ruder
dirl
than
you
were
yesterday
to
poor
could
not
have
been
found
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
england
you
could
scarcely
expect
me
to
be
pleased
sir
the
news
was
broken
to
me
very
suddenly
and
i
was
tired
after
my
long
journey
too
yes
and
you
vented
your
spite
on
me
on
poor
old
who
has
the
kindest
heart
in
christendom
i
may
have
said
some
things
that
i
regret
said
maggie
but
at
any
rate
i
had
the
night
to
think
matters
over
and
if
you
give
me
some
breakfast
i
can
talk
to
you
i
will
take
you
to
harrison
for
breakfast
said
martin
get
a
topper
there
i
can
tell
you
eggs
bacon
kidneys
liver
cocoa
coffee
tea
chocolate
anything
and
everything
you
fancy
and
the
best
marmalade
in
london
maggie
felt
rather
hungry
and
when
the
pair
entered
harrison
she
was
not
displeased
at
the
liberal
supply
of
food
which
her
future
stepfather
ordered
he
pretended
to
hate
the
aristocracy
as
he
called
them
and
poor
maggie
could
certainly
never
claim
this
distinction
in
her
own
little
person
nevertheless
she
was
entirely
superior
to
martin
and
he
felt
a
sort
of
pride
in
her
as
she
walked
up
the
long
restaurant
by
his
side
now
waiter
he
said
to
the
man
who
approached
to
take
orders
you
look
slippy
this
young
and
me
we
want
a
real
comfortable
filling
meal
you
give
us
the
best
the
house
contains
and
look
slippy
i
say
the
waiter
did
look
slippy
whatever
that
word
might
imply
and
martin
proceeded
to
treat
maggie
to
really
excellent
viands
and
to
satisfy
himself
to
his
heart
content
maggie
ate
with
a
certain
amount
of
relish
for
as
has
been
said
she
was
really
hungry
like
it
do
you
said
martin
as
he
watched
her
consuming
her
eggs
and
bacon
oh
yes
very
much
indeed
said
maggie
i
fond
of
a
good
table
myself
said
martin
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
have
on
all
occasions
and
at
every
meal
at
laburnum
villa
we
soon
fill
your
poor
mother
thin
cheeks
out
and
get
her
rosy
and
plump
and
then
she
be
a
more
charming
to
her
own
than
ever
maggie
was
silent
come
come
said
martin
patting
her
hand
it
all
right
about
laburnum
villa
ai
it
my
girl
no
martin
said
maggie
then
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
turned
and
looked
at
him
fixedly
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
myself
she
said
i
was
really
rude
to
you
yesterday
and
i
am
sorry
but
i
could
go
to
live
with
you
and
mother
at
laburnum
villa
i
will
tell
you
the
principal
reason
why
i
could
go
oh
come
come
you
only
a
child
you
must
do
what
you
are
told
your
mother
has
no
money
to
give
you
and
you
ca
live
on
air
you
know
air
is
all
very
well
but
it
do
keep
folks
alive
you
have
to
come
to
me
whether
you
like
it
or
not
before
you
come
to
that
determination
martin
may
i
tell
you
something
about
myself
oh
dear
i
hope
it
is
a
long
story
it
very
important
and
not
very
long
i
am
not
the
least
like
mother
my
good
girl
any
one
can
see
that
your
mother
a
remarkably
pretty
and
elegant
woman
and
you
the
plainest
young
person
i
ever
came
across
i
am
plain
said
maggie
and
in
addition
i
am
by
no
means
oh
you
admit
that
for
shame
i
was
born
that
way
said
maggie
i
a
very
girl
and
i
have
got
ideas
with
regard
to
my
future
you
said
just
now
that
perhaps
some
day
you
might
make
me
accountant
in
your
shop
that
was
kind
of
you
and
i
might
be
a
good
accountant
but
of
course
all
that
is
for
the
future
i
should
mind
that
i
mean
not
particularly
but
if
you
were
to
follow
out
your
plan
and
take
me
to
live
with
you
and
mother
at
laburnum
villa
you
would
never
have
a
happy
moment
for
you
see
i
am
much
stronger
in
character
than
mother
and
i
could
help
making
your
life
miserable
whereas
you
and
mother
would
be
awfully
happy
without
me
mother
says
that
she
loves
you
and
wishes
to
be
your
wife
now
what
are
you
driving
at
popsy
for
if
you
have
nothing
hanging
on
your
hands
i
have
a
vast
lot
hanging
on
mine
and
time
is
precious
i
will
tell
you
quite
frankly
what
i
want
you
to
do
martin
you
are
taking
mother
i
am
willing
to
take
you
too
i
ca
do
any
more
but
then
you
see
i
do
want
to
be
taken
until
you
came
forward
and
proposed
to
mother
to
be
your
wife
she
spent
a
little
of
her
money
on
my
education
she
tells
me
that
she
has
put
it
now
into
your
business
poor
thing
said
martin
she
was
making
ducks
and
drakes
of
it
but
it
is
safe
enough
now
yes
said
maggie
in
a
determined
voice
but
i
think
somehow
that
a
part
of
it
does
lawfully
belong
to
me
oh
come
tut
tut
i
think
so
said
maggie
in
a
resolute
tone
for
you
see
it
was
father
money
and
though
he
left
it
absolutely
to
mother
it
was
to
go
to
me
at
her
death
and
it
was
meant
little
as
it
was
to
help
to
educate
me
i
could
ask
a
lawyer
all
about
the
rights
of
course
for
some
extraordinary
reason
martin
looked
rather
frightened
you
can
go
to
any
lawyer
you
please
he
said
but
what
for
let
me
ask
if
i
take
you
and
do
for
you
and
provide
for
you
what
has
a
lawyer
to
say
in
the
matter
well
that
is
just
it
that
just
what
i
have
to
inquire
into
because
you
see
martin
i
do
want
you
to
provide
for
me
at
all
i
think
now
we
are
coming
to
the
point
said
martin
stick
to
it
popsy
for
time
precious
i
think
you
ought
to
allow
me
to
be
educated
out
of
mother
money
i
sure
you
know
enough
i
do
really
know
enough
ward
of
aylmer
house
has
taken
me
as
an
inmate
of
her
school
for
forty
pounds
a
year
her
terms
for
most
girls
are
a
great
deal
more
martin
looked
with
great
earnestness
at
maggie
i
want
to
go
on
being
ward
pupil
and
i
want
you
to
allow
me
forty
pounds
a
year
for
the
purpose
and
twenty
over
for
my
clothes
and
small
expenses
that
is
sixty
pounds
a
year
altogether
i
shall
be
thoroughly
educated
then
and
it
seems
only
fair
that
out
of
mother
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
sixty
pounds
of
the
money
should
be
spent
on
me
there
no
use
talking
to
mother
for
she
gets
so
easily
puzzled
about
money
but
you
have
a
very
good
business
head
you
see
martin
i
am
only
just
sixteen
and
if
i
get
two
more
education
i
shall
be
worth
something
in
the
world
whereas
now
i
am
worth
nothing
i
hope
you
will
think
it
over
martin
and
do
what
i
wish
martin
was
quite
silent
for
a
minute
the
waiter
came
along
and
was
paid
his
bill
with
a
very
substantial
tip
for
himself
thrown
in
still
martin
lingered
at
the
with
his
eyes
lowered
there
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
i
like
about
this
he
said
and
what
is
that
asked
maggie
that
you
came
to
me
on
the
matter
instead
of
going
to
your
mother
that
you
recognized
the
strength
and
force
of
my
character
oh
any
one
can
see
that
said
maggie
you
put
it
straight
too
with
regard
to
your
own
disagreeable
nature
yes
i
put
it
straight
said
maggie
well
all
i
can
say
at
present
is
this
i
will
think
it
over
you
go
home
to
your
mother
now
and
tell
her
that
her
will
be
in
as
usual
to
tea
and
you
little
girl
may
as
well
make
yourself
scarce
at
that
hour
here
a
sovereign
for
you
go
and
have
a
jolly
time
somewhere
oh
martin
i
began
maggie
her
face
crimson
you
had
best
not
put
on
airs
said
martin
and
maggie
slipped
the
sovereign
into
her
pocket
when
she
reached
her
mother
lodgings
she
felt
well
assured
that
she
had
done
the
right
thing
hitherto
she
had
been
too
stunned
and
miserable
to
use
any
of
her
power
that
strange
power
which
she
possessed
on
martin
but
she
felt
well
assured
that
she
could
do
so
in
the
future
she
had
gauged
his
character
correctly
he
was
hopelessly
vulgar
but
an
absolutely
and
straight
person
he
will
do
what
i
wish
she
thought
her
uneasiness
vanished
as
soon
as
the
first
shock
of
her
mother
disclosure
was
over
she
entered
the
house
why
missie
said
tildy
you
been
the
stony
cold
upstairs
and
cryin
like
nothin
at
all
thank
you
tildy
i

said
maggie
and
i
do
want
any
breakfast
for
i
had
it
already
with
the
haristocracy

tildy
in
a
low
awed
kind
of
voice
you
always
was
one
o
they
miss
maggie

with
the
aristocracy
said
maggie
trying
to
suppress
her
feelings
tildy
your
smut

your
left
cheek
this
morning
you
can
remove
the
and
i
go
up
to
mother
maggie
ran
upstairs
howland
had
eaten
a
little
very
indifferent
breakfast
and
was
looking
weepy
and
as
she
sat
in
her
faded
near
the
open
window
really
maggie
she
said
when
her
daughter
entered
your
ways

me
most
terribly

do
wish
poor
martin
would
insist
on
your
coming
to

an
easy
moment
with
your
queer
pranks

maggie
but

so
weak
this
morning
said
howland
if
i
were
you
miss
maggie
said
tildy
as
she
swept
the
cups
and
saucers
with
noisy
vehemence
on
to
a
tray
i
would
worrit
the
poor
mistress
and
she
just
on
the
eve
of
a
matrimonial
venture
tryin
to
the
nerves
it
is
so
ross
tells
me
says
she
i

on
the
twitter

near
the
brink
for
that
ross
speaks
o
matrimony
please

quick
tildy
and
go
said
maggie
in
a
determined
voice
matilda
cleared
the
table
but
before
she
would
take
her
departure
she
required
definite
instructions
with
regard
to
dinner
tea
and
supper
howland
raised
a
distracted
face
really
i
ca
think
she
said
my
head
is
so
weak
well
mum
said
matilda
as
missus
and
me
does
the
for
you
you
ai
fit
mum
it
but
to
look
at
you
to
know
that
it
lyin
down
you
ought
to
be
with
haromatic
vinegar
on
your
you
quite
right
matilda
well
you
see
to
the
things
have
them
choice
but
not
too
choice
fairly
expensive
but
not
too
expensive
you
understand
yus
said
tildy
and
left
the
room
maggie
found
herself
alone
with
her
mother
mother
she
said
eagerly
now
i
will
tell
you
why
i
was
not
home
for
breakfast
this
morning
oh
it
does
matter
maggie
said
howland
i
am
too
weak
to
be
worried
and
that
a
fact
it
wo
worry
you
mother
i
breakfasted
with
mr
martin
what
what
said
howland
astonishment
in
her
voice
and
with
eyebrows
raised
almost
to
meet
her
hair
and
an
excellent
breakfast
we
had
said
maggie
he
is
a
bad
sort
at
all
mother
well
i
am
glad
you
found
that
out
do
you
suppose
your
mother
would
marry
a
man
who
was
not
most
estimable
in
character
he
is
quite
estimable
mother
the
only
unfortunate
thing
against
him
is
that
he
is
not
in
your
rank
in
life
a
woman
who
lives
in
these
rooms
said
howland
has
no
rank
in
life
well
dear
mother
i
can
not
agree
with
you
however
as
i
said
i
breakfasted
with
him
then
you
coming
round
said
howland
you
going
to
be
good
and
a
comfort
to
us
both
no
mother
i
have
come
round
a
bit
when
i
was
breakfasting
with
martin
i
fully
explained
to
him
what
a
fearful
trial
i
should
be
to
him
how
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
i
annoy
him
you
did
that
oh
you
wicked
child
i
thought
it
best
to
be
frank
mother
i
made
an
impression
on
him
i
did
what
i
did
as
much
for
your
sake
as
for
mine
then
he
break
off
the
engagement
of
course
he
will
said
howland
she
took
a
moist
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
and
pressed
it
to
her
eyes
not
he
he
is
just
devoted
to
you
mother
you
need
have
no
such
apprehension
what
else
did
you
say
to
him
well
mother
darling
i
said
what
i
thought
right
oh
of
course
you
wo
confide
in
me
i
think
not
i
will
let
him
do
that
he
is
coming
to
tea
this
afternoon
and
he
has
given
me
a
sovereign
how
maggie
felt
inclined
to
kick
that
sovereign
to
go
and
have
some
pleasure
somewhere
so
i
mean
to
take
the
train
to
richmond
and
perhaps
get
a
boatman
to
take
me
out
on
the
river
for
a
little
he
is
certainly
more
playful
and
amusing
when
you
are
not
here
said
howland
a
faint
smile
dawning
on
her
face
i
am
certain
of
that
said
maggie
and
what
more
he
is
very
fond
of
good
living
i
mean
to
go
out
presently
and
get
some
excellent
things
for
his
tea
will
you
maggie
will
you
my
child
why
that
will
be
quite
sweet
of
you
i
will
do
it
with
pleasure
mother
but
now
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
ah
said
howland
i
thought
you
were
coming
to
that
well
it
is
this
said
maggie
when
he
talks
to
you
about
me
oppose
him
he
will
most
probably
propound
a
scheme
to
you
as
his
own
perhaps
and
you
are
to
be
quite
certain
to
let
him
think
that
it
is
his
own
scheme
and
you
might
make
out
to
him
mother
that
i
am
really
very
disagreeable
and
that
nothing
in
all
the
world
would
make
me
anything
else
and
if
you
are
a
very
wise
little
mother
you
will
tell
him
that
you
are
happier
alone
with
him
which
i
am
i
am
said
howland
he
is
a
dear
quite
a
dear
and
so
comical
and
amusing
then
it
all
right
said
maggie
you
know
i
told
you
yesterday
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
live
at
laburnum
villa
but
i
will
certainly
come
to
you
mums
in
the
holidays
if
you
wish
it
but
dear
child
there
is
no
money
to
keep
you
at
that
expensive
school
there
is
a
penny
oh
well
well
mother
perhaps
that
can
be
managed
but
now
we
need
talk
any
more
about
my
future
until
after
martin
has
had
tea
with
you
if
you
have
any
news
for
me
when
i
return
from
richmond
you
can
let
me
know
you
are
a
very
independent
girl
to
go
to
richmond
by
yourself
oh
that
be
all
right
said
maggie
in
a
cheerful
tone
have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me
yes
you
know
all
that
beautiful
jewellery
that
my
dear
father
brought
back
with
him
from
those
different
countries
where
he
spent
his
life
howland
looked
mysterious
and
frightened
it
was
meant
for
me
eventually
was
it
not
said
maggie
oh
well
i
suppose
so
only
somehow
i
have
a
in
it
you
wo
want
for
jewellery
when
you
are
martin
wife
indeed
no
why
he
has
given
me
a
diamond
ornament
for
my
hair
already
he
means
to
take
me
out
a
great
deal
he
says
out
oh
mother
in
his
set
well
dear
child
i
shall
get
accustomed
to
that
do
you
think
you
might
give
me
father
jewellery
said
maggie
is
it
worth
a
great
deal
said
howland
i
never
could
bear
to
look
at
it
that
is
since
he
died
you
have
given
it
to
martin
have
you
mother
no
nor
said
a
word
about
it
to
him
either
well
suppose
now
that
we
have
a
quiet
time
we
look
at
the
jewellery
said
maggie
very
well
said
howland
then
she
added
i
was
to
sell
some
of
it
but
your
father
was
so
queer
and
the
things
seemed
so
very
ugly
and
unlike
what
is
worn
that
i
never
had
the
heart
to
part
with
them
i
do
suppose
they
fetch
a
great
deal
let
look
at
them
said
maggie
howland
from
her
chair
then
sank
back
again
no
she
said
i
am
afraid
of
them
your
father
told
me
so
many
stories
about
each
and
all
he
courted
death
to
get
some
of
them
and
others
came
into
his
hands
through
such
extraordinary
adventures
that
i
shudder
at
night
when
i
recall
what
he
said
i
want
to
forget
them
martin
would
never
admire
them
at
all
i
want
to
forget
all
my
past
life
absolutely
you
like
your
father
and
perhaps
you
admire
that
sort
of
thing
but
they
are
not
to
my
taste
here
the
key
of
my
wardrobe
you
will
find
the
tin
boxes
which
hold
the
jewels
you
can
take
them
only
never
let
out
a
word
to
your
stepfather
he
know
i
posses
them
no
one
does
thank
you
mother
said
maggie
in
a
low
voice
will
you
lie
down
on
the
sofa
mums
oh
here
a
nice
new
novel
for
you
to
read
i
bought
it
coming
up
in
the
train
yesterday
you
read
and
rest
and
feel
quite
contented
and
let
me
go
to
the
bedroom
to
look
at
the
jewels
very
well
said
howland
you
can
have
them
i
consider
them
of
little
or
no
importance
only
do
tell
your
stepfather
he
is
not
that
yet
mums
well
well
said
howland
what
does
a
fortnight
matter
be
your
stepfather
in
a
fortnight
yes
take
the
key
and
go
i
shall
be
glad
to
rest
on
the
sofa
you
in
a
much
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind
thank
you
dear
mother
said
maggie
she
entered
the
bedroom
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
she
held
her
mother
bunch
of
keys
in
her
hand
first
of
all
she
unlocked
the
wardrobe
and
then
removing
the
tin
boxes
laid
them
on
the
table
which
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
took
the
precaution
first
however
to
lock
the
bedroom
door
having
done
this
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
and
selecting
the
proper
keys
unlocked
the
two
tin
boxes
one
of
them
contained
the
twelve
famous
bracelets
which
maggie
had
described
to
molly
and
isabel
tristram
she
would
keep
her
word
she
would
give
a
bracelet
to
each
girl
she
recognized
at
once
the
two
which
she
considered
suitable
for
the
girls
and
then
examined
the
others
with
minute
care
her
mother
could
not
admire
what
was
strange
in
pattern
and
dimmed
by
neglect
but
maggie
with
her
wider
knowledge
knew
well
that
she
possessed
great
treasures
which
if
possible
she
would
keep
but
which
if
necessary
she
could
sell
for
sums
of
money
which
would
enable
her
to
start
in
life
according
to
her
own
ideas
she
put
the
twelve
bracelets
back
into
their
case
and
then
opening
the
second
tin
box
took
from
it
many
quaint
curios
the
value
of
which
she
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
there
was
a
great
deal
of
gold
and
silver
and
queer
in
brass
and
there
were
pendants
and
long
chains
and
brooches
and
queer
ornaments
of
all
kinds
poor
father
thought
the
girl
she
felt
a
lump
in
her
throat
a
choking
sensation
which
seemed
to
make
her
mother
present
conduct
all
the
more
intolerable
how
was
she
to
live
in
the
future
with
the
knowledge
that
her
father
memory
was
as
she
felt
profaned
but
at
least
she
had
got
his
treasures
she
relocked
the
two
tin
boxes
and
stowing
them
carefully
away
in
her
own
trunk
transferred
the
keys
from
her
mother
bunch
to
her
own
and
brought
her
mother
keys
back
to
howland
have
you
looked
at
them
are
they
worth
anything
maggie
memories
mostly
said
maggie
evasively
oh
then
said
howland
i
am
glad
you
have
them
for
i
hate
memories
mother
said
maggie
and
she
went
on
her
knees
to
her
parent
you
have
really
given
them
to
me
well
of
course
child
did
i
say
so
i
do
want
them
i
looked
at
the
things
for
years
i
wonder
mums
if
you
would
write
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
for
me
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
howland
martin
does
approve
of
what
he
calls
documents
darling
mother
you
not
martin
wife
yet
i
want
you
to
put
on
paper
that
you
have
given
me
father
curios
he
always
meant
them
for
me
did
he
he
did
he
did
said
howland
one
of
the
very
last
things
he
said
in
his
letter
i
mean
for
you
know
he
died
in
africa

appreciated
by
my
little
girl

mother

mother

something
on
this
bit
of
paper
my
head
is
so
weak
i
have
an
idea
what
to
say
i
dictate
it
to
you
if
i
may
very
well
child
i
suppose
i
ca
prevent
you
maggie
brought
paper
and
pen
and
howland
presently
wrote
i
have
given
on
the
eve
of
my
marriage
to
martin
her
father
treasures
to
my
daughter
margaret
howland
thank
you
mother
said
maggie
the
date
was
affixed
howland
added
the
name
she
was
so
soon
to
resign
and
maggie
almost
skipped
into
the
bedroom
it
all
right
now
she
said
to
herself
she
unlocked
her
trunk
also
unlocking
one
of
the
tin
boxes
in
the
box
which
contained
the
twelve
bracelets
she
put
the
piece
of
paper
in
her
mother
handwriting
she
then
relocked
the
box
relocked
the
trunk
and
came
back
to
her
mother
restored
to
perfect
maggie
was
in
her
element
when
she
was
planning
things
yesterday
was
a
day
of
despair
but
was
a
day
of
hope
she
sat
down
by
her
mother
desk
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
molly
tristram
in
which
she
told
molly
that
her
mother
was
about
to
be
married
again
to
a
very
rich
man
she
mentioned
the
coming
marriage
in
a
few
brief
words
and
then
went
on
to
speak
of
herself
and
of
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
welcome
molly
and
isabel
when
they
arrived
at
aylmer
house
not
by
the
faintest
suggestion
did
she
give
her
friend
to
understand
the
step
down
in
the
social
scale
which
howland
marriage
with
martin
meant
having
finished
her
letter
she
thought
for
a
minute
then
wrote
a
careful
line
to
merry
cardew
she
did
not
tell
merry
about
her
mother
approaching
marriage
but
said
that
molly
would
have
news
for
her
in
other
respects
her
letter
to
merry
was
very
much
more
confidential
than
her
letter
to
molly
she
assured
merry
of
her
deep
love
and
begged
of
her
friend
to
regard
this
letter
as
quite
private
if
you
feel
you
must
show
it
to
people
tear
it
up
rather
than
do
so
said
maggie
for
i
can
not
bear
that
our
great
and
sacred
love
each
for
the
other
should
be
commented
on
when
merry
received
the
letter
she
neither
showed
it
to
any
one
else
nor
tore
it
up
she
could
not
forget
maggie
face
as
she
parted
from
her
and
the
fact
that
she
had
refused
to
accept
the
ten
pounds
which
the
little
girl
had
wanted
to
give
her
in
order
to
remove
her
from
musty
fusty
lodgings
had
raised
maggie
considerably
in
her
estimation
meanwhile
maggie
howland
having
finished
her
letters
went
out
and
posted
them
she
then
changed
her
sovereign
and
bought
some
excellent
and
appetizing
fruit
and
cakes
for
her
mother
and
martin
tea
she
consulted
with
tildy
as
to
how
these
dainties
were
to
be
arranged
and
tildy
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
with
effusion
and
declared
that
they
were
perfect
crowns
of
beauty
and
that
most
assuredly
they
would
melt
in
martin
mouth
on
hearing
this
maggie
hastened
to
change
the
conversation
but
when
she
had
impressed
upon
tildy
the
of
a
snowy
cloth
being
placed
upon
the
ugly
tray
and
further
begged
of
her
to
polish
up
the
teapot
and
spoons
tildy
thought
that
miss
maggie
was
more
wonderful
than
ever
with
them
as
is
about
to
step
into
the
pains
should
be
took
thought
tildy
and
she
mentioned
her
sentiments
to
ross
who
shook
her
head
sadly
and
replied
that
one
ought
to
do
the
best
one
could
for
the
poor
things
at
three
maggie
put
on
her
hat
drew
her
gloves
on
and
taking
up
a
parasol
went
out
darling
she
said
to
her
mother
after
all
she
did
not
go
to
richmond
it
was
too
far
off
and
she
was
feeling
a
little
tired
besides
the
thought
of
her
father
wonderful
treasures
filled
her
mind
she
determined
to
go
to
south
kensington
and
look
at
similar
jewels
and
ornaments
which
she
believed
she
could
find
there
it
occurred
to
her
too
that
it
might
be
possible
some
day
to
consult
the
manager
of
the
jewel
department
with
regard
to
the
worth
of
the
things
which
her
dear
father
had
sent
home
but
this
she
would
not
do
her
visit
to
the
south
kensington
museum
made
her
feel
positively
assured
that
she
had
articles
of
great
value
in
the
tin
boxes
meanwhile
howland
waited
impatiently
for
martin
she
was
puzzled
about
maggie
and
yet
relieved
she
wondered
much
what
maggie
could
have
said
to
martin
that
day
when
she
breakfasted
with
him
she
was
not
really
alarmed
but
had
she
been
able
to
look
into
martin
mind
she
would
have
felt
a
considerable
amount
of
surprise
the
worthy
grocer
although
an
excellent
man
of
business
knew
little
or
nothing
about
law
maggie
words
had
made
him
distinctly
uncomfortable
suppose
after
all
the
girl
could
claim
a
right
in
her
father
beggarly
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
perhaps
the
child
of
the
man
who
had
settled
that
little
income
on
his
wife
must
have
some
sort
of
right
to
it
it
would
be
horrible
to
consult
lawyers
they
were
so
terribly
expensive
too
there
was
a
man
in
the
shop
however
of
the
name
of
howard
he
was
the
principal
shopwalker
and
martin
had
a
great
respect
for
him
without
mentioning
names
he
put
the
case
before
him
as
he
himself
expressed
it
in
a
nutshell
howard
thought
for
a
few
minutes
then
said
slowly
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
a
certain
portion
of
the
money
should
be
spent
on
the
child
in
fact
that
the
child
had
a
right
to
it
martin
did
not
like
this
a
heavy
frown
came
between
his
brows
the
girl
was
a
smart
and
clever
girl
not
a
bit
like
and
she
could
make
herself
very
disagreeable
her
modest
request
for
sixty
pounds
a
year
did
not
seem
unreasonable
he
thought
and
thought
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
inclined
he
felt
to
give
maggie
her
way
when
he
arrived
at
ross
house
he
did
not
look
quite
as
cheerful
as
usual
he
went
upstairs
as
tildy
expressed
it
and
although
both
she
and
ross
watched
for
that
delightful
scene
when
he
was
to
martin
entered
the
without
making
any
exhibition
of
himself
the
room
looked
quite
clean
and
inviting
for
maggie
had
dusted
it
with
her
own
hands
and
there
was
a
very
nice
tea
on
the
board
and
howland
was
dressed
very
prettily
indeed
martin
gave
a
long
whistle
i
say
he
remarked
whoever
has
been
and
done
it
what
do
you
mean
james
said
howland
why
the
place
said
martin
it
looks
sort
of
different
oh
it
maggie
said
howland
she
went
out
and
bought
all
those
cakes
for
you
herself
bless
me
now
did
she
said
martin
she
a
smart
girl
a
smart
girl
she
a
very
clever
girl
james
yes
that
how
i
put
it
very
clever
she
has
a
way
about
her
she
has
james
every
one
thinks
so
well
give
me
a
good
meal
and
then
we
talk
howland
lifted
the
teapot
and
was
preparing
to
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
for
martin
when
he
looked
at
her
noticed
her
extreme
elegance
and
grace
and
made
a
spring
toward
her
you
have
give
one
kiss
yet
you
naughty
howland
colored
as
she
kissed
him
of
course
she
liked
him
very
much
but
somehow
maggie
had
brought
a
new
atmosphere
into
the
house
even
howland
felt
it
let
eat
let
eat
said
martin
i
never
deny
myself
the
good
things
of
life
that
girl
knows
a
thing
or
two

a
clever
girl

years
victoria
chapter
xiv
in
the
park
howland
did
not
like
to
have
her
years
mentioned
martin
had
been
careful
never
to
do
so
until
maggie
appeared
on
the
scene
on
the
contrary
he
had
dropped
hints
that
his
birdling
his
his
victoria
was
in
the
early
bloom
of
youth
but
now
he
said
that
she
was
a
wonderful
woman
for
her
years
howland
bridled
slightly
i
am
not
old
james
she
said
come

said
the
grocer
no
of

it

or
young
victoria

you
suit
me
and
i

and
that
girl
clever
uncommon

by
the
way
how
old
may
she
happen
to
be
sixteen

last

howland
i

very
very
young
a
mere
child
when
i

you
a
bit
huffy

worried
since
maggie
came
back
she
was
so
rude
to
you
yesterday
i
felt
it
terribly
did
you
now
well
that
was
very
sensible
of
you
we
finish
our
tea
before
we
begin
our
talk
come
eat
your
cake
and
drink
your
tea
and
make
yourself
agreeable
to
your
howland
felt
cheered
she
did
enjoy
her
meal
and
if
she
liked
it
martin
liked
it
immensely
also
what
a
useful
girl
that
would
be
he
said
we
could
make
her
housekeeper
at
laburnum
villa
in
no
time
she
has
a
head
on
her
shoulders
howland
was
silent
she
was
dreading
inexpressibly
the
little
scene
which
she
felt
must
be
endured
between
her
and
her
intended
we
ring
the
bell
now
said
martin
wiping
a
few
crumbs
from
his
mouth
and
dusting
his
trousers
with
his
get
tildy
to
remove
all
these
things
and
then
what
do
you
say
to
my
taking
you
for
a
drive
to
the
park
oh
i
should
like
that
said
howland
in
surprise
thought
so
never
say
that
is
ah
here
you
be
tildy
you
clear
away
smart
my
girl
and
then
whistle
for
a
do
you
hear
me
a
not
a
look
as
sharp
as
you
can
my
girl
and
i
give
you
sixpence
thank
you
sir
said
tildy
she
looked
with
admiring
eyes
at
the
pair
who
were
so
close
to
the
matrimonial
venture
and
quickly
removed
all
traces
of
the
meal
now
then
go
into
your
room
and
get
dressed
for
your
drive
howland
did
so
she
put
on
an
elegant
sort
of
which
had
been
presented
to
her
by
martin
a
lace
fichu
over
her
shoulders
and
a
pair
of
long
white
gloves
she
had
also
been
presented
with
a
white
parasol
by
martin
he
thought
that
no
one
could
look
more
beautiful
than
his
ladylove
when
she
reappeared
in
the
the
at
the
door
he
said
we
go
now
and
start
on
our
drive
howland
rose
and
tildy
agreed
with
martin
as
to
appearance
when
she
stepped
into
that
hansom
tildy
said
she
looked
ross
remarked
that
as
elegant
women
before
now
had
become
widows
in
no
time
tildy
shuddered
and
said
that
ross
should
not
say
things
of
that
sort
ross
replied
that
she
invariably
spoke
the
truth
and
then
returned
to
her
dismal
kitchen
meanwhile
martin
and
howland
were
driven
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
hyde
park
london
society
people
were
fast
going
out
of
town
for
it
was
very
nearly
the
end
of
july
but
still
there
were
a
few
carriages
about
and
some
fine
horses
and
some
gaily
dressed
ladies
and
several
men
martin
provided
a
couple
of
chairs
for
himself
and
his
future
wife
and
they
sat
for
some
little
time
enjoying
the
fresh
air
and
looking
on
at
the
gay
scene
it
is
wonderful
said
martin
what
a
sight
of
money
is
wasted
in
this
sort
of
thing
but
they
enjoy
it
do
they
said
howland
yes
my
pet
he
replied
but
not
as
you
and
me
will
enjoy
laburnum
villa
and
now
can
you
attend
to
business
i
have
a
very
weak
head
for
business
was
the
reply
do
i
know
it
my
pet
and
i
am
the
last
person
on
earth
to
allow
you
to
be
worried
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
victory
if
your
head
is
weak
as
regards
money
matters
your
girl
has
a
topping
good
brain
in
that
direction
now
i
have
a
notion
in
my
head
about
her
you
ca
do
anything
with
her
said
howland
she
is
quite
impossible
i
never
thought
she
would
treat
you
as
she
did
i
could
weep
when
i
think
of
it
i
should
be
surprised
if
on
account
of
her
rudeness
and
ingratitude
we
broke
off
the
engagement
i
really
james
what
do
you
take
me
for
said
james
it
is
the
girl
i
want
to
marry
it
you
oh
dear
said
howland
of
course
i
know
she
ai
a
patch
on
you
that
is
i
mean
as
regards
looks
but
now
do
you
fret
if
you
have
been
turning
things
over
in
your
mind
so
have
i
been
turning
things
over
in
my
mind
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
all
is
that
i
believe
that
girl
right
after
all
right
after
all
but
dear
dear
james
the
child
ca
live
on
nothing
who
said
she
was
to
live
on
nothing
said
martin
do
tremble
it
more
than
i
can
stand
i
have
been
thinking
that
a
sharp
young
miss
like
that
wants
a
bit
more
training
she
wants
breaking
in
now
i
no
mind
to
the
job
i
can
manage
my
not
one
of
them
can
come
round
me
i
can
tell
you
but
a
miss
like
your
daughter
brought
up
altogether
i
will
say
above
her
station
is
beyond
me
what
i
have
been
turning
over
in
my
mind
is
this
that
a
year
or
two
training
longer
will
do
her
no
sort
of
harm
oh
said
howland
she
was
trembling
exceedingly
i
think
too
continued
martin
that
laburnum
villa
might
not
be
agreeable
to
her
at
present
and
if
it
ai
agreeable
to
her
put
on
the
sulks
and
that
more
than
i
abide
cheerfulness
i
must
have
my
joke
i
must
be
allowed
to
make
my
fun
in
my
own
way
i
must
enjoy
you
and
me
we
hit
it
off
splendid
and
let
the
girl
go
for
the
present
but
she
must
go
somewhere
said
howland
good
gracious
my
lady
do
you
suppose
i
allow
the
girl
to
be
destitute
no
i
ready
to
do
the
generous
and
now
i
tell
you
something
you
must
blame
her
too
much
she
repented
of
her
manner
last
night
and
came
to
me
as
pretty
as
you
please
this
morning
and
asked
me
to
breakfast
with
her
i
was
taken
aback
but
she
came
round
me
and
we
went
to
harrison
and
had
a
topping
meal
then
she
spoke
to
me
very
sensible
and
explained
that
she
wanted
more
and
more
and
all
the
rest
of
the
ladies
accomplishments
she
consulted
me
very
pretty
and
very
proper
indeed
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
i
am
willing
to
allow
her
forty
pounds
a
year
for
her
education
at
that
blessed
aylmer
house
where
all
the
swells
go
and
to
keep
her
there
for
two
years
certain
and
i
am
willing
further
to
give
her
twenty
pounds
a
year
to
spend
on
dress
of
course
she
takes
her
holidays
with
us
then
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
turns
out
what
i
hope
she
will
i
will
make
her
an
accountant
in
the
shop
it
will
be
a
post
for
her
and
i
am
sure
from
the
way
she
talks
she
has
a
splendid
head
for
business
now
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
say
there
never
was
your
like
martin
rubbed
his
hands
thought
you
be
pleased
he
said
the
girl
spoke
very
proper
indeed
this
morning
and
she
is
a
good
girl
plain
and
sensible
and
i
could
but
take
notice
of
her
words
now
then
we
take
a
fresh
and
hurry
home
and
i
take
you
out
and
give
you
a
right
good
bit
of
dinner
and
afterwards
go
to
the
play

me

about
a
week
before

much
to

to

charming
girl
of
the

with
fräulein

and
to
reassure

very
lively

conscientious

time
very
nervous

regard
to
her
own
powers

capables
et
bien
distinguées
mais
ma
foi
comme
elles
me
fatiguent
les
nerfs
mademoiselle
laplage
would
say
and
although
she
had
been
at
aylmer
house
for
three
terms
she
always
doubted
her
powers
and
made
the
same
speech
over
and
over
again
at
the
beginning
of
each
term
in
addition
to
miss
talbot
there
was
a
very
cheery
bright
girl
of
the
name
of
johnson
who
looked
after
the
girls
wardrobes
and
helped
them
if
necessary
with
their
work
saw
that
they
were
punctual
at
meals
and
occasionally
took
an
english
class
she
was
a
great
favorite
with
all
the
girls
at
school
they
called
her
lucy
instead
of
miss
johnson
she
was
quite
young
not
more
than
twenty
years
of
age
these
four
ladies
resided
at
aylmer
house
but
masters
and
mistresses
for
various
accomplishments
came
daily
to
instruct
the
girls
ward
loved
her
teachers
almost
as
much
as
she
loved
her
girls
and
they
each
and
all
adored
her
miss
talbot
was
an
exceedingly
clever
woman
close
on
thirty
years
of
age
she
had
taken
very
high
honors
at
cambridge
and
was
a
person
of
great
penetration
of
character
with
a
genius
for
imparting
knowledge
unlike
most
ward
seldom
changed
her
staff
of
teachers
she
had
the
gift
of
selection
to
a
marvellous
degree
and
never
was
known
to
make
a
mistake
with
regard
to
the
choice
of
those
women
who
helped
her
in
her
great
work
of
education
summer
was
of
course
over
when
the
girls
assembled
at
aylmer
house
nevertheless
there
was
a
sort
of
afterglow
of
summer
which
was
further
intensified
by
the
beautiful
flowers
in
the
and
by
the
fresh
clean
fragrant
atmosphere
of
the
house
itself
the
two
cardews
and
the
two
tristrams
came
up
to
aylmer
house
by
an
early
train
tristram
brought
them
to
school
and
cardew
at
the
last
moment
feeling
unequal
to
the
task
of
parting
with
their
darlings
in
the
presence
of
their
companions
the
real
parting
had
taken
place
the
previous
night
and
that
pain
which
merry
had
felt
at
intervals
during
the
end
of
the
summer
vacation
was
sharp
enough
to
cause
her
to
cry
when
she
lay
down
to
sleep
on
the
night
before
going
to
school
but
merry
was
brave
and
so
was
cicely
and
although
merry
did
hate
beyond
words
the
thought
of
not
seeing
her
beloved
father
and
her
dear
mother
until
christmas
she
thought
also
that
very
good
times
were
before
her
and
she
was
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
them
molly
and
isabel
who
were
quite
accustomed
to
going
to
school
had
no
pangs
of
heart
at
all
when
they
bade
their
mother
as
to
peterkins
and
jackdaw
as
they
were
also
going
to
school
on
the
following
day
they
scarcely
observed
the
departure
of
their
sisters
only
saying
when
belle
hugged
one
and
molly
the
other
what
a
fuss
you
girls
do
make
now
if
and
fanciful
were
to
fret
about
us
there
be
some
reason
in
it
but
mother
going
to
look
after
them
and
mother
a
brick
i
can
tell
you
the
girls
laughed
very
merrily
and
asked
what
message
her
two
adorers
would
like
to
send
to
maggie
the
two
adorers
only
vouchsafed
the
remark
do
bother
we
going
to
be
with
boys
now
and
boys
are
worth
all
the
girls
in
creation
put
together
the
journey
to
town
was
taken
without
any
special
adventure
and
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
an
omnibus
containing
the
four
girls
accompanied
by
tristram
with
their
luggage
piled
on
the
roof
stopped
at
aylmer
house
aneta
had
already
arrived
and
as
the
girls
entered
with
a
new
feeling
of
timidity
through
the
doors
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
maggie
in
the
distance
there
were
other
girls
absolute
strangers
to
them
who
peeped
for
a
minute
over
the
balusters
and
then
retired
from
view
but
whatever
the
four
strangers
might
have
felt
with
regard
to
these
interesting
occurrences
every
other
feeling
was
brought
into
subjection
by
the
appearance
of
ward
on
the
scene
ward
looked
quite
as
stately
as
cardew
with
her
beautiful
face
still
quite
young
with
her
most
kind
most
gentle
most
protective
manner
with
the
glance
of
the
eye
and
the
pressure
of
the
hand
which
spoke
untold
volumes
of
meaning
merry
felt
her
loving
heart
rise
in
sudden
adoration
cicely
gave
her
a
quick
adoring
glance
as
to
molly
and
isabel
they
were
speechless
with
pleasure
you
have
come
dears
said
ward
welcome
all
four
these
are
your
girls
tristram
she
singled
out
molly
and
isabel
without
being
introduced
to
them
i
know
them
she
said
with
a
smile
from
their
likeness
to
you
and
these
are
the
cardews
now
which
is
cicely
and
which
merry
ah
i
think
i
can
tell
this
is
merry
is
she
not
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
pretty
girl
shoulder
yes
i
am
merry
replied
meredith
cardew
in
a
voice
which
almost
choked
her
and
you
of
course
are
cicely
said
ward
in
this
house
all
the
girls
speak
to
each
other
by
their
christian
names
and
you
will
be
cicely
and
merry
to
me
as
molly
and
isabel
tristram
will
be
molly
and
isabel
to
me
you
know
aneta
of
course
she
is
hovering
near
anxious
to
take
possession
of
you
go
with
her
dears
i
think
all
my
girls
have
now
is
it
not
so
miss
talbot
yes
ward
replied
miss
talbot
miss
talbot
may
i
introduce
my
four
new
pupils
to
you
cicely
and
merry
cardew
and
molly
and
isabel
tristram
you
will
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
miss
talbot
girls
for
she
is
our
english
teacher
and
my
very
great
friend
miss
talbot
blushed
slightly
from
pleasure
she
said
a
gentle
word
to
each
girl
and
a
minute
afterwards
they
had
so
to
speak
crossed
the
rubicon
and
were
in
the
heart
of
aylmer
house
for
aneta
had
seized
merry
hand
and
cicely
followed
immediately
afterwards
while
molly
and
belle
found
themselves
one
at
each
side
of
maggie
howland
oh
this
is
delightful
said
maggie
we
have
all
met
at
last
the
day
glorious
is
the
place
perfect
are
you
in
love
with
mrs
ward
she
seems
very
nice
said
molly
in
an
almost
timid
voice
how
nice
merry
and
cicely
look
continued
maggie
you
look
nice
yourself
maggie
everything
is
wonderful
said
molly
not
a
bit
like
the
school
in
hanover
of
course
not
who
could
compare
it
said
maggie
meanwhile
aneta
cicely
and
merry
had
gone
on
in
front
but
as
they
were
ascending
the
broad
low
stairs
merry
turned
and
glanced
at
maggie
and
smiled
at
her
and
maggie
smiled
back
at
merry
oh
that
smile
of
merry
how
it
caused
her
heart
to
leap
aneta
try
as
she
would
could
not
take
merry
cardew
quite
away
from
her
cicely
and
merry
had
a
bedroom
together
two
little
white
beds
stood
side
by
side
the
drugget
on
the
floor
was
pale
blue
the
room
was
a
study
in
pale
blue
and
white
it
was
all
exquisitely
neat
fresh
airy
and
the
smell
of
the
flowers
in
the
came
in
through
the
open
windows
why
said
cicely
with
a
gasp
we
might
almost
be
in
the
country
this
is
one
of
the
nicest
rooms
in
the
whole
house
said
aneta
but
why
should
i
say
that
she
continued
when
every
room
is
so
to
speak
perfect
i
never
saw
ward
however
more
particular
than
she
was
about
your
bedroom
girls
i
think
she
is
very
much
pleased
at
your
coming
to
aylmer
house
cicely
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
out
it
is
so
nice
to
be
in
london
she
said
but
somehow
i
thought
it
would
be
much
more
noisy
aneta
laughed
aylmer
house
she
said
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
great
square
we
do
have
huge
traffic
in
the
squares
and
really
at
night
it
is
as
quiet
as
the
country
itself
but
hark
hark
said
merry
there
is
a
funny
sound
after
all
what
do
you
take
it
for
asked
aneta
i
do
know
said
merry
i
could
almost
imagine
that
we
were
by
the
seaside
and
that
the
sound
was
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
beach
it
is
the
roar
of
human
breakers
said
aneta
one
always
hears
that
kind
of
sound
even
in
the
quietest
parts
of
london
it
is
the
great
traffic
in
the
thoroughfares
not
far
away
it
is
delightful
wonderful
said
merry
oh
i
long
to
know
all
the
girls
you
will
introduce
us
wo
you
aneta
of
course
and
you
must

quick

and
molly

isabel
and
maggie
howland
and
i
make

to
make
the
acquaintance
of
fourteen
others
i
never
can
possibly
remember
their
names
said
merry
you
will
have
to
try
that
the
first
thing
expected
of
a
schoolgirl
to
know
the
names
of
her
schoolfellows

my
best

said
poor
merry
well
i
no
doubt
she
will
let
you
off
very
easily
during
the
first
few
days
said
aneta
but
afterwards
she
is
just
as
particular
as
woman
can
be
the
girls
went
downstairs
where
a
group
of
other
girls
most
of
them
wearing
pretty
white
dresses
for
they
were
all
still
in
full
summer
attire
met
in
the
wide
pleasant
hall
aneta
performed
the
ceremony
of
introduction
henrietta
and
mary
gibson
may
i
introduce
my
special
friends
and
cousins
cicely
and
meredith
otherwise
merry
cardew
two
tall
fair
girls
responded
to
this
introduction
with
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
and
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
here
is
rosamond
dacre
continued
aneta
as
a
very
dark
somewhat
plain
girl
appeared
in
rosamond
my
friends
and
cousins
cicely
and
merry
cardew
rosamond
shook
hands
but
stiffly
and
without
any
smile
the
next
minute
a
laughing
merry
handsome
little
girl
with
eyes
very
dark
curling
eyelashes
and
quantities
of
curling
black
hair
tumbled
rather
than
walked
into
view
ah
kathleen
kitty
you
just
as
incorrigible
as
ever
cried
aneta
girls
this
is
our
irish
romp
as
we
always
call
her
her
name
is
kathleen
now
then
kathleen
you
must
be
good
you

and
not
too
terribly
irish
i
have
the
honor
to
present
to
you
kathleen
my
cousins
cicely
and
merry
cardew
kathleen
did
more
than
smile
she
laughed
outright
i
am
delighted
you
have
come
she
said
how
are
you
is
school
glorious
i
do
love
it
i
have
come
straight
from
glengariff
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
whole
of
ireland
do
you
know
ireland
have
you
ever
seen
bantry
bay
oh
there
is
no
country
in
all
the
world
like
it
and
there
is
no
scenery
so
magnificent
come
kitty
not
quite
so
much
chatter
said
ah
the
the
girls
now
followed
aneta
into
a
pleasant
room
which
looked
out
on
to
a
small
garden
the
garden
compared
to
the
great
sweeping
lawns
and
lovely
parterres
of
meredith
manor
was
insignificant
nevertheless
with
the
french
windows
of
the
refectory
wide
open
and
the
beds
full
of
hardy
flowers
gay
geraniums
late
roses
innumerable
asters
fuchsias
it
appeared
as
a
fresh
surprise
to
the
country
girls
it
is
like
london
thought
merry
at
tea
she
found
herself
greatly
to
her
relief
at
maggie
side
there
was
also
another
piece
of
good
fortune
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
the
cardews
whose
conversational
french
was
still
almost
mademoiselle
laplage
was
unexpectedly
absent
the
good
lady
being
forced
to
remain
in
her
room
with
a
sudden
overpowering
headache
and
pleasant
lucy
otherwise
miss
johnson
took
her
place
perfect
freedom
girls
said
miss
johnson
ah
good
lucy
thank
you
lucy
exclaimed
kathleen
that
right
lucy
hurrah
for
lucy
cried
several
other
voices
no
discipline
at
all
continued
lucy
school
does
begin
until
cicely
was
seated
near
aneta
with
kathleen
at
her
other
side
just
for
a
minute
aneta
eyes
traveled
across
the
table
and
fixed
themselves
on
maggie
face
maggie
found
herself
coloring
and
a
resentful
feeling
awoke
in
her
heart
she
could
not
dare
to
oppose
aneta
and
yet
and
yet
she
was
determined
at
any
cost
to
keep
the
love
of
merry
cardew
for
herself
meanwhile
merry
who
was
equally
delighted
to
find
herself
by
side
began
to
talk
to
her
in
a
low
tone
you
do
look
very
well
mags
she
said
not
nearly
as
robust
as
when
i
saw
you
last
and
you
never
wrote
to
me
after
that
first
letter
i
have
a
great
deal
i
want
to
tell
you
said
maggie
in
a
low
tone
lucy
is
quite
right
there
are
no
lessons
of
any
sort
this
evening
ward
always
gives
us
the
first
evening
to
settle
and
to
get
perfectly
at
home
in
so
we
shall
be
able
to
chatter
to
our
content
this
is
going
to
be
a
glorious
night
and
we
can
walk
about
in
the
garden
but
wo
there
be
a
lot
of
other
people
in
the
garden
asked
merry
why
of
course
said
maggie
in
a
surprised
tone
i
suppose
all
be
there
we
ca
talk
any
secrets
if
that
is
what
you
mean
said
merry
for
the
garden
is
so
very
small
maggie
laughed
that
because
you
are
accustomed
to
meredith
manor
she
said
anyhow
she
continued
dropping
her
voice
i
must
talk
to
you
i
have
a
great
great
deal
to
say
and
you
have
to
listen
of
course
i
will
listen
dear
said
merry
rosamond
dacre
now
joined
in
and
the
conversation
became
general
henrietta
and
mary
gibson
had
a
very
agreeable
way
of
describing
things
maggie
felt
herself
reinstated
in
the
life
she
loved
merry
the
girl
she
cared
for
best
was
by
her
side
and
she
would
not
have
had
a
single
thorn
in
the
flesh
but
for
the
presence
of
aneta
it
has
been
said
that
in
this
school
there
were
two
girls
who
held
considerable
sway
over
their
companions
one
of
them
was
aneta
lysle
the
other
maggie
howland
aneta
had
of
course
far
and
away
the
greater
number
of
girls
under
her
spell
if
such
a
word
could
describe
her
high
and
noble
influence
over
them
but
maggie
had
her
own
friends
among
whom
were
rosamond
dacre
kathleen
matty
and
clara
roache
and
janet
burns
all
these
girls
were
fairly
nice
but
not
so
and
not
so
noble
in
tone
as
the
girls
who
devoted
themselves
to
aneta
kathleen
was
indeed
altogether
charming
she
was
the
romp
of
the
school
and
the
darting
of
every
one
but
rosamond
dacre
was
decidedly
morose
and
sulky
she
was
clever
and
on
this
account
her
mistresses
liked
her
but
she
was
a
truly
difficult
girl
to
deal
with
being
more
or
less
shut
up
within
herself
and
disinclined
to
true
friendship
with
any
one
she
liked
kathleen
however
and
kathleen
adored
maggie
rosamond
was
therefore
considered
to
be
on
maggie
side
of
the
school
matty
and
clara
roache
were
quite
ordinary
everyday
sort
of
girls
neither
very
nor
the
reverse
neither
specially
clever
nor
specially
stupid
their
greatest
friend
was
janet
burns
a
handsome
little
girl
with
a
very
lofty
brow
calm
clear
gray
eyes
and
a
passionate
adoration
for
maggie
howland
matty
and
clara
would
follow
janet
to
the
world
end
and
as
janet
adhered
to
maggie
they
were
also
on
maggie
side
maggie
naturally
expected
to
add
to
the
numbers
of
her
special
adherents
her
own
two
friends
the
tristrams
she
felt
she
could
easily
have
won
merry
also
to
join
the
ranks
of
adorers
but
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
her
friendship
for
merry
should
be
even
more
subtle
than
the
ordinary
friendship
that
an
ordinary
girl
who
is
queen
at
school
gives
to
her
fellows
she
did
not
dare
to
defy
aneta
merry
must
outwardly
belong
to
aneta
but
if
her
heart
was
what
else
mattered
when
tea
was
over
several
of
the
girls
drifted
into
the
garden
where
they
walked
in
twos
discussing
their
holidays
their
old
friends
and
the
time
which
was
just
coming
there
was
not
a
trace
of
unhappiness
in
any
face
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
seemed
to
breathe
peace
and
goodwill
aneta
and
cicely
with
some
of
aneta
own
friends
two
girls
of
the
name
of
armitage
anne
and
jessie
and
a
very
graceful
girl
called
sylvia
john
walked
up
and
down
talking
quietly
together
for
some
little
time
then
cicely
looked
eagerly
round
her
i
ca
see
merry
anywhere
she
remarked
she
is
all
right
dear
i
am
sure
said
aneta
but
aneta
in
her
inmost
heart
did
not
think
so
she
was
however
far
too
prudent
to
say
a
word
to
make
her
cousin
cicely
uneasy
meanwhile
maggie
and
merry
had
found
a
cosy
corner
for
themselves
in
one
of
the
conservatories
they
sat
side
by
side
in
two
little
well
you
come
said
maggie
i
have
carried
out
my
design
my
heart
desire
is
satisfied
oh
how
sweet
you
are
maggie
said
merry
i
have
missed
you
so
much
she
added
i
have
so
often
wished
for
you
do
you
really
love
me
asked
maggie
looking
at
merry
in
her
queer
abrupt
manner
you
know
i
do
said
merry
well
said
maggie
there
are
a
great
many
girls
in
the
school
who
love
me
very
dearly
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
said
merry
why
maggie
at
that
handsome
little
irish
girl
kathleen
you
call
her
could
take
her
eyes
off
you
oh
kitty
said
maggie
yes
she
is
on
my
side
what
do
you
mean
by
your
side
well
of
course
i
have
told
you
have
i
that
there
are
two
of
us
in
this
school
who
are
more
looked
up
to
than
the
others
it
seems
very
conceited
for
me
to
say
that
i
happen
to
be
one
of
course
i
am
not
a
patch
on
aneta
i
know
that
perfectly
well
aneta
is
a
darling
said
merry
and
she
is
my
own
cousin
but
she
dropped
her
voice
maggie
somehow
i
ca
help
loving
you
best
oh
said
maggie
with
a
start
is
that
true
it
is
it
is
maggie
was
silent
for
a
minute
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
said
very
gently
you
wo
be
hurt
at
something
i
want
to
tell
you
hurt
no
said
merry
why
should
i
be
well
it
is
just
this
aneta
is
frightfully
jealous
of
me
oh
i
do
believe
it
said
merry
indignantly
it
is
in
her
nature
to
be
jealous
it
very
to
be
jealous
there
is
no
school
said
maggie
where
jealousy
does
not
abound
there
is
no
life
into
which
jealousy
does
not
enter
the
world
itself
is
made
up
of
jealous
people
aneta
is
jealous
of
me
and
i
i
am
jealous
of
her
oh
maggie
dear
you
must
not
and
you
ought
not
to
be
jealous
of
aneta
she
thinks
so
kindly
so
sweetly
of
every
one
she
loves
you
said
maggie
you
just
go
and
tell
her
how
much
you
care
for
me
that
you
love
me
better
than
you
love
her
and
see
how
she
will
take
it
but
i
would
tell
her
that
said
little
merry
for
it
would
hurt
her
there
said
maggie
with
a
laugh
and
yet
you
pretend
that
you
think
her
jealous
she
will
never
be
jealous
of
me
for
i
never
give
her
cause
dear
aneta
said
merry
maggie
was
again
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
few
minutes
listen
to
me
merry
she
said
in
this
school
the
girls
follow
the
queens
if
i
wanted
to
make
aneta
lysle
really
mad
with
jealousy
i
get
you
over
to
me
but
do
speak
for
a
minute
i
wo
get
you
over
to
me
you
shall
stay
at
school
and
be
on
aneta
side
i
suppose
i
suppose
i
ought
said
merry
in
a
faint
voice
you
must
you
must
be
on
aneta
side
of
the
school
and
so
must
cicely
but
you
can
all
the
same
love
me
best
can
i
said
merry
brightening
up
then
if
i
can
i
mind
a
bit
maggie
patted
her
hand
very
gently
you
can
merry
and
you
can
help
me
you
will
always
take
my
part
wo
you
indeed
indeed
i
will
but
it
wo
be
necessary
it
may
be
said
maggie
very
earnestly
promise
that
if
the
time
comes
you
will
take
my
part
i
promise
of
course
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
maggie
you
do
look
a
bit
yourself
maggie
did
not
at
once
reply
i
shall
have
a
great
deal
to
do
this
term
she
said
after
a
pause
and
my
party
in
the
school
wo
be
so
weak
after
all
there
be
rosamond
dacre
i
did
very
much
like
rosamond
said
merry
speaking
in
a
low
voice
oh
she
is
excellent
fun
when
you
know
her
said
maggie
but
as
she
wo
be
on
your
side
nor
in
your
form
you
are
not
likely
to
have
much
to
do
with
her
then
matty
and
clara
are
and
mine
too
and
kathleen
is
a
perfect
brick
and
janet
burns
she
as
strong
as
they
make
of
course
the
tristrams
will
belong
to
me
let
me
see
tristrams
two
rosamond
three
kathleen
four
matty
and
clara
six
janet
seven
ah
well
i
am
quite
in
the
minority
aneta
carries
off
eleven
girls
as
her
share
do
be
sad
about
it
maggie
surely
we
might
all
be
one
in
the
school
why
should
there
be
parties
said
merry
little
you
know
merry
how
impossible
would
be
without
parties
and
great
friends
and
medium
friends
and
favorites
and
enemies
why
merry
school
is
a
little
world
and
the
world
is
made
up
of
elements
such
as
these
tell
me
said
merry
after
a
pause
what
you
did
after
you
left
us
maggie
colored
oh
stayed
for
a
time
in
that
horrid
bush
in
those
fusty
musty
lodgings
said
merry
yes
and
they
were
fusty
musty
oh
dear
i
am
sorry
for
you
we
had
such
a
glorious
time
i
know
it
dear
but
glorious
times
do
come
to
girls
like
me
why
are
you
so
very
very
sad
maggie
oh
now
i
know
of
course
i
know
i
did
like
to
write
to
you
about
it
for
it
seemed
to
me
quite
you
will
forgive
me
wo
you
quite
dreadful
that
your
mother
should
have
married
again
is
she
married
yet
maggie
maggie
nodded
oh
i
can
sympathize
with
you
dear
maggie
it
must
be
so
fearful
to
have
a
stepfather
it
is
said
maggie
is
he
a
nice
man
maggie
or
would
you
rather
i
did
speak
of
him
no
you
may
speak
of
him
if
you
like
he
is
a
rich
man
he
is
very
rich
i
am
glad
of
that
at
any
rate
said
merry
you
will
never
be
in
fusty
musty
lodgings
any
more
oh
no
never
my
mother
husband
i
can
not
speak
of
him
as
my
stepfather
will
see
to
that
what
is
his
name
maggie
hesitated
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
let
any
of
her
schoolfellows
know
the
real
position
but
she
could
not
very
well
conceal
her
stepfather
name
martin
she
said
spelt
with
a
we
know
some
awfully
nice
martyns
they
live
about
twenty
miles
away
from
meredith
manor
i
wonder
if
your
martyn
is
related
to
them
oh
very
likely
said
maggie
then
perhaps
you
will
go
to
stay
with
them
your
mother
and
your
your
mother
husband
and
you
too
and
we
all
meet
they
live
at
a
the
meadows
it
is
as
old
or
as
beautiful
as
our
manor
but
it
a
sweet
place
and
the
girls
are
so
nice
you
be
sure
to
like
them
yes
i
dare
say
i
shall
said
maggie
who
did
care
to
contradict
merry
innocent
ideas
with
regard
to
her
mother
marriage
well
i
am
glad
said
merry
that
your
dear
mother
has
married
a
rich
gentleman
has
he
a
country
place
of
his
own
of
course
he
has
said
maggie
who
felt
that
she
could
at
least
utter
these
words
with
truth
and
is
it
far
far
from
london
or
quite
in
the
country
it
is
said
maggie
in
in
the
norwood
direction
this
remark
made
no
impression
whatever
on
merry
who
had
not
the
least
idea
where
the
norwood
direction
was
but
when
she
parted
from
maggie
and
joined
her
sister
and
aneta
she
said
i
have
a
piece
of
rather
good
news
to
tell
about
dear
maggie
howland
she
wo
be
poor
any
more
that
is
a
word
we
never
discuss
at
school
said
aneta
well
we
need
after
said
merry
with
a
slight
touch
of
irritation
in
her
manner
but
although
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
poverty
means
i
think
poor
maggie
knows
a
good
deal
about
it
well
she
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
in
future
for
her
mother
has
just
married
again
oh
said
aneta
with
a
show
of
interest
yes
and
a
very
nice
gentleman
he
must
be
he
is
a
cousin
of
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
you
know
how
you
liked
them
when
we
spent
a
day
there
during
these
holidays
did
you
aneta
yes
said
aneta
most
charming
people
i
felt
quite
sorry
that
the
martyn
girls
were
too
old
for
school
i
wonder
they
did
mention
the
fact
of
their
cousin
being
about
to
marry
howland
for
you
know
we
were
talking
of
maggie
to
them
or
at
least
you
were
merry
of
course
i
was
said
merry
in
a
determined
voice
i
am
very
very
fond
of
maggie
howland
perhaps
we
had
better
go
to
bed
now
said
aneta
i
may
as
well
tell
you
girls
that
we
have
to
get
up
at
six
lucy
comes
to
us
and
wakes
us
at
that
hour
and
we
are
expected
to
be
downstairs
at
seven
lucy
will
tell
you
too
girls
that
it
is
expected
of
us
all
that
we
shall
keep
our
rooms
in
perfect
order
now
shall
we
say
the
cardews
kissed
their
cousin
and
went
to
their
own
pleasant
room
as
soon
as
they
were
there
merry
said
cicely
i
am
glad
about
poor
maggie
and
so
am
i
said
cicely
when
we
write
home
we
must
be
sure
to
mention
to
mother
about
martyn
i
do
think
dear
maggie
knew
anything
about
the
meadows
so
perhaps
after
all
he
is
a
somewhat
distant
cousin
but
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
know
that
he
is
rich
and
a
gentleman
yes
said
cicely
then
she
added
i
do
think
aneta
wants
you
to
make
too
great
a
friend
of
maggie
howland
oh
nonsense
said
merry
coloring
slightly
i
am
never
going
to
give
maggie
up
for
i
love
her
dearly
of
course
said
cicely
it
would
be
very
mean
to
give
her
up
but
you
and
i
as
aneta
cousins
must
be
on
her
side
in
the
school
what
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
maggie
will
try
to
induce
you
to
join
her
set
that
shows
how
little
you
know
her
said
merry
roused
to
the
defensive
she
explained
everything
to
me
this
afternoon
and
said
that
i
certainly
must
belong
to
aneta
did
she
well
i
call
that
splendid
said
cicely
chapter
xvi
when
aneta
found
herself
alone
that
evening
she
stayed
for
a
short
time
thinking
very
deeply
she
felt
a
queer
sense
of
responsibility
with
regard
to
the
cardews
if
maggie
imagined
that
it
was
through
her
influence
they
had
come
to
aylmer
house
aneta
was
positive
that
they
would
never
have
entered
the
school
but
for
her
and
her
aunt
lady
lysle
besides
they
were
her
very
own
cousins
and
she
loved
them
both
dearly
she
was
not
especially
anxious
about
cicely
who
was
a
more
ordinary
and
less
enthusiastic
girl
than
merry
but
about
merry
she
had
some
qualms
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
girl
was
attracted
by
maggie
and
in
aneta
opinion
maggie
howland
was
in
no
sense
of
the
word
a
proper
companion
for
her
aneta
as
she
sat
calmly
by
her
open
window
for
it
was
not
necessary
to
hurry
to
bed
thought
much
over
the
future
which
spread
itself
immediately
in
front
of
her
and
her
companions
she
was
naturally
a
very
reserved
girl
she
was
born
with
that
exclusiveness
and
reserve
which
a
distinguished
class
bestows
upon
those
who
belong
to
it
but
she
had
in
her
heart
very
wide
sympathies
and
like
many
another
girl
in
her
position
she
could
be
kind
to
the
poor
philanthropic
to
the
last
degree
to
those
in
real
distress
denying
herself
for
the
sake
of
those
who
wanted
bread
towards
girls
however
who
were
only
a
trifle
below
her
in
the
social
scale
she
could
be
arbitrary
haughty
and
strangely
wanting
in
sympathy
maggie
howland
was
exactly
the
sort
of
girl
who
repelled
aneta
nevertheless
she
was
a
member
of
the
school
and
not
only
was
she
a
member
of
the
school
but
a
very
special
member
had
she
even
been
janet
burns
who
was
so
clever
and
as
far
as
learning
was
concerned
carried
all
before
her
or
had
she
been
as
brilliant
and
witty
as
kathleen
aneta
would
not
have
troubled
herself
much
over
her
but
maggie
was
possessed
of
a
curious
sense
of
which
was
hers
by
heritage
which
her
father
had
possessed
before
her
and
which
caused
him
one
of
the
least
prepossessing
and
yet
one
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
his
day
to
be
worshipped
wherever
he
went
this
power
was
greater
than
beauty
greater
than
birth
greater
than
genius
maggie
had
it
and
used
it
to
such
effect
that
she
and
aneta
divided
the
school
between
them
aneta
was
never
quite
certain
whether
some
of
her
special
friends
would
not
leave
her
and
go
over
to
maggie
side
but
she
felt
that
she
did
not
greatly
care
about
this
provided
she
could
keep
merry
and
cicely
altogether
to
herself
after
thinking
for
a
little
time
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
going
to
the
electric
bell
sounded
it
after
a
short
delay
a
servant
appeared
mary
said
aneta
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
ask
miss
lucy
if
i
may
speak
to
her
for
a
minute
yes
miss
replied
mary
closing
the
door
behind
her
in
her
usual
noiseless
fashion
in
a
very
few
minutes
miss
johnson
entered
aneta
room
i
was
just
thinking
of
going
to
bed
dear
said
that
young
woman
can
i
do
anything
for
you
i
only
want
to
say
something
to
you
lucy
what
is
it
my
love
i
do
not
like
to
see
that
our
dear
aneta
looks
worried
but
your
face
almost
wears
that
expression
well
said
aneta
it
is
just
this
i
am
a
trifle
worried
about
a
matter
which
i
hope
i
may
set
right
it
is
against
the
rules
for
girls
to
leave
their
rooms
after
they
have
gone
to
them
for
the
night
and
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
be
the
first
to
break
a
rule
at
aylmer
house
nevertheless
i
do
want
to
break
it
may
i
miss
lucy
well
aneta
i
do
not
think
that
there
be
the
slightest
difficulty
for
we
do
really
begin
school
till
what
do
you
wish
to
do
dear
i
want
to
go
and
visit
one
of
my
schoolmates
and
stay
with
her
for
a
time
of
course
you
may
go
aneta
i
give
you
permission
but
do
remain
too
long
for
we
get
up
early
as
school
really
begins
i
wo
remain
a
minute
longer
than
i
can
help
thank
you
lucy
said
aneta
miss
johnson
kissed
her
pupil
and
left
the
room
a
minute
later
aneta
lysle
was
running
down
the
corridor
in
the
direction
of
the
bedroom
occupied
by
maggie
howland
it
was
some
distance
from
her
own
room
she
knocked
at
the
door
she
guessed
somehow
that
maggie
would
be
still
up
maggie
said
come
in
and
aneta
entered
maggie
was
in
a
white
with
her
thick
handsome
hair
falling
below
her
waist
her
hair
was
her
strongest
point
and
she
looked
for
the
time
being
almost
pretty
what
do
you
want
aneta
she
said
to
speak
to
you
maggie
but
it
against
the
rules
said
maggie
drawling
out
her
words
a
little
and
giving
aneta
a
defiant
glance
no
said
aneta
i
asked
for
permission
to
come
and
see
you
and
i
have
obtained
it
well
sit
down
wo
you
said
maggie
aneta
availed
herself
of
the
invitation
and
took
a
chair
maggie
remained
standing
wo
you
sit
too
maggie
said
aneta
i
do
particularly
want
to
but
i
will
if
you
insist
on
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
a
little
sleepy
you
wo
keep
me
long
will
you
that
depends
on
yourself
maggie
opened
her
narrow
eyes
then
she
contracted
them
and
looked
fixedly
at
her
companion
have
you
come
here
to
talk
about
merry
cardew
yes
about
her
and
other
matters
do
you
trust
me
at
all
aneta
aneta
looked
full
up
at
the
girl
no
maggie
she
said
do
you
think
when
you
say
so
that
you
speak
kindly
i
am
afraid
i
do
but
i
ca
help
myself
said
aneta
maggie
gave
a
faint
yawn
she
was
in
reality
far
too
interested
to
be
really
sleepy
suddenly
she
dropped
into
a
sitting
position
on
the
floor
you
have
me
she
said
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
do
you
mean
to
crush
me
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
hate
me
so
much
i
never
said
i
hated
you
said
aneta
i
do
hate
you
but
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
that
you
should
not
have
any
influence
over
my
two
young
cousins
who
came
here
i
thought
we
discussed
that
when
you
were
staying
at
meredith
manor
said
maggie
you
made
me
unhappy
enough
then
but
i
gave
you
my
promise
i
was
sorry
to
make
you
unhappy
maggie
and
you
did
give
me
your
promise
but
i
have
come
here
to
know
why
you
have
broken
it
broken
it
said
maggie
broken
it
do
you
understand
me
said
aneta
you
and
merry
were
together
the
greater
part
of
the
evening
and
even
cicely
wondered
where
her
sister
was
why
did
you
do
it
merry
is
my
friend
said
maggie
i
do
wish
her
to
be
your
friend
i
am
afraid
you
ca
help
it
said
maggie
she
looked
a
little
insolent
and
round
her
mouth
there
came
a
dogged
expression
after
a
minute
she
said
i
did
want
to
talk
to
merry
but
at
the
same
time
i
most
undoubtedly
did
not
forget
my
promise
to
you
i
explained
to
merry
what
i
think
she
already
knew
that
there
were
two
girls
in
the
school
who
greatly
influence
their
fellows
in
short
that
you
and
i
are
the
two
queens
of
the
school
but
i
said
that
compared
to
you
i
had
a
comparatively
small
number
of
subjects
merry
was
interested
and
asked
questions
and
then
i
most
particularly
explained
to
her
that
although
i
knew
well
she
cared
for
me
and
i
cared
for
her
she
was
to
be
on
your
side
in
the
school
if
you
believe
me
you
have
but
to
ask
merry
herself
i
have
no
reason
not
to
believe
you
maggie
said
aneta
and
i
am
relieved
that
you
have
spoken
as
you
did
to
merry
but
now
i
want
to
say
something
else
i
have
thought
of
it
a
good
deal
during
the
holidays
and
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
this
taking
sides
or
rather
making
parties
in
a
school
is
pernicious
especially
in
such
a
small
school
as
ours
i
am
willing
to
give
up
my
queendom
if
you
on
your
part
will
give
yours
up
i
want
us
all
to
be
in
unity
every
one
of
us
all
striving
for
the
good
of
the
school
and
for
the
happiness
and
welfare
each
of
the
other
if
you
will
agree
to
this
i
will
myself
speak
to
ward
mrs
ward
said
maggie
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
i
want
to
consult
with
her
so
that
may
be
the
queen
of
the
school
not
one
girl
or
two
girls
she
is
so
clever
so
young
so
resourceful
that
she
will
more
than
make
up
to
us
for
the
little
we
lose
in
this
matter
but
of
course
there
is
no
manner
of
use
in
my
resigning
my
queendom
if
you
wo
resign
yours
i
will
never
do
it
said
maggie
never
two
queens
in
the
school
means
little
or
nothing
at
all
all
it
does
mean
is
that
i
have
special
friends
whom
i
can
influence
and
whom
i
love
to
influence
and
you
have
special
friends
whom
you
love
to
influence
well
go
on
influencing
them
as
hard
as
ever
you
can
and
i
will
do
the
same
with
my
friends
your
cousins
will
belong
to
you
i
could
i
believe
have
won
merry
cardew
to
my
side
but
i
am
not
going
to
do
so
it
would
be
very
unwise
of
you
said
aneta
in
a
low
tone
very
well
maggie
she
added
after
a
pause
if
you
wo
give
up
being
queen
in
the
minds
of
a
certain
number
of
girls
i
must
of
course
continue
my
influence
on
the
other
side
it
a
great
pity
for
we
might
all
work
together
we
never
could
work
together
said
maggie
with
passion
it
is
but
to
talk
to
you
aneta
to
know
how
you
despise
and
hate
me
i
neither
despise
nor
hate
you
maggie
well
i
despise
and
hate
you
so
i
suppose
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
i
am
very
very
sorry
maggie
some
day
perhaps
you
will
know
me
as
i
really
am
i
know
you
now
as
you
really
are
eaten
up
with
pride
of
birth
and
with
no
sympathy
at
all
for
girls
a
trifle
poorer
than
yourself
you
speak
with
cruelty
and
i
am
sorry
to
aneta
astonishment
maggie
face
underwent
a
queer
change
it
puckered
up
in
an
alarming
manner
and
the
next
moment
the
girl
burst
into
tears
the
sight
of
maggie
tears
immediately
changed
aneta
attitude
those
tears
were
genuine
whether
they
were
caused
by
anger
or
by
sorrow
she
did
not
stop
to
discriminate
the
next
minute
she
was
down
on
her
knees
by
the
other
girl
and
had
swept
her
young
arms
round
maggie
neck
maggie
maggie
what
is
it
oh
if
you
would
only
understand
me
do
do
touch
me
said
maggie
i
am
a
miserable
girl
and
i
have
hurt
you
poor
maggie
said
aneta
oh
i
am
terribly
sorry
sit
here
now
and
let
me
comfort
you
oh
i
ca
aneta
you
do
understand
me
not
a
bit
better
than
you
think
perhaps
and
i
am
terribly
sorry
you
are
troubled
oh
perhaps
i
know
i
was
told
that
your
mother
had
married
again
you
are
unhappy
about
that
maggie
immediately
dried
her
tears
she
felt
that
she
was
in
danger
if
aneta
found
out
or
if
ward
found
out
who
stepfather
was
she
would
certainly
not
be
allowed
to
stay
at
aylmer
house
this
was
her
dread
of
all
dreads
and
she
had
so
managed
matters
with
her
mother
that
ward
knew
nothing
at
all
of
howland
change
of
name
yes
my
mother
is
married
again
said
maggie
she
is
a
rich
woman
now
but
the
fact
is
i
dearly
loved
my
own
father
and
it
hurt
me
very
much
to
see
another
put
into
his
place
of
course
it
did
said
aneta
with
deep
sympathy
it
would
have
driven
me
nearly
wild
does
ward
know
that
your
mother
is
married
again
maggie
well
i
have
told
her
and
please
aneta
will
you
promise
me
not
to
do
so
but
is
there
any
occasion
to
keep
it
a
secret
dear
i
would
so
much
rather
she
did
not
know
she
received
me
here
as
maggie
howland
i
am
maggie
howland
still
my
mother
having
changed
her
name
makes
no
difference
except
indeed
that
she
is
very
well
off
whereas
she
was
poor
well
that
of
course
is
a
comfort
to
you
said
aneta
perhaps
you
will
learn
to
be
glad
that
your
mother
has
secured
the
care
of
a
good
husband
i
am
told
that
she
has
married
one
of
those
very
nice
martyns
who
live
in
warwickshire
is
that
true
maggie
nodded
she
hated
herself
after
she
had
given
that
inclination
of
her
head
but
she
had
done
it
now
and
must
abide
by
it
to
own
martin
the
grocer
as
a
stepfather
was
beyond
her
power
aneta
did
not
think
it
specially
necessary
to
worry
about
mother
and
her
new
husband
she
said
that
the
whole
thing
was
own
affair
and
after
trying
to
comfort
the
girl
for
a
little
longer
she
kissed
maggie
and
went
to
her
own
room
when
there
she
went
at
once
to
bed
and
fell
fast
asleep
but
maggie
sat
for
a
long
time
by
her
open
window
what
an
awful
and
ridiculous
position
i
have
put
myself
in
she
thought
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
and
of
laburnum
villa
to
be
connected
i
could
almost
scream
with
laughter
if
i
were
not
also
inclined
to
scream
with
terror
what
an
awful
idea
to
get
into
people
heads
and
now
i
have
confirmed
it
of
course
i
shall
be
found
out
and
things
will
be
worse
than
ever
before
maggie
went
to
bed
she
sat
down
and
wrote
a
brief
note
to
her
mother
she
addressed
it
when
written
to
martyn
spelt
with
a
y
laburnum
villa
clapham
maggie
had
seen
laburnum
villa
and
regarded
it
as
one
of
the
most
poky
suburban
residences
she
had
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
entering
the
whole
house
was
odiously
cheap
and
common
and
in
her
heart
poor
maggie
preferred
tildy
and
ross
and
the
fusty
musty
lodgings
at
shepherd
bush
her
note
to
her
mother
was
very
brief
i
am
back
at
school
and
quite
happy
tell
martin
if
he
should
happen
to
write
to
me
to
spell
his
name
with
a
and
please
spell
your
name
with
a
please
tell
martin
that
i
will
explain
the
reason
of
this
when
we
meet
he
is
so
good
to
me
i
do
know
how
to
thank
him
enough
maggie
managed
the
next
day
to
post
this
letter
unknown
to
her
fellows
and
in
course
of
time
a
remarkable
arrived
for
her
it
was
dated
from
laburnum
villa
clapham
and
was
written
in
a
sprawly
but
hand
no
for
me
thank
very
fortunately
maggie
received
her
card
when
none
of
her
schoolfellows
were
present
but
it
was
certainly
the
reverse
of
reassuring
chapter
xvii
the
leisure
hours
began
in
real
earnest
and
at
aylmer
house
was
so
stimulating
so
earnest
so
invigorating
that
all
that
was
best
in
each
girl
was
brought
to
the
fore
there
was
an
admirable
which
allowed
the
girls
periods
for
play
as
well
as
the
most
suitable
hours
for
work
in
addition
each
day
there
were
what
were
called
the
leisure
hours
these
were
from
five
to
seven
each
evening
the
leisure
hours
began
immediately
after
tea
and
lasted
until
the
period
when
the
girls
went
to
their
rooms
to
dress
for
dinner
during
these
two
hours
they
were
allowed
to
do
precisely
what
they
pleased
ward
was
most
particular
that
no
teacher
should
interfere
with
her
girls
during
the
leisure
hours
from
the
very
first
she
had
insisted
on
this
period
of
rest
and
absolute
relaxation
from
all
work
work
was
strictly
forbidden
in
the
school
from
five
to
seven
and
it
was
during
that
period
that
the
queens
of
the
school
generally
exercised
their
power
aneta
then
usually
found
herself
surrounded
by
her
satellites
in
one
corner
of
the
girls
own
special
and
maggie
was
in
a
similar
position
at
the
farther
end
satellites
were
always
quiet
sober
and
maggie
it
is
sad
to
relate
were
a
trifle
rowdy
there
is
something
else
also
painful
to
relate
namely
that
merry
cardew
cast
longing
eyes
from
time
to
time
in
the
direction
of
that
portion
of
the
room
where
maggie
and
her
friends
clustered
the
girls
had
been
about
a
fortnight
at
school
and
work
was
in
full
swing
when
kathleen
springing
from
her
seat
said
abruptly
queen
i
want
to
propose
something
well
what
is
it
asked
maggie
who
was
lying
back
against
a
pile
of
cushions
and
supplying
herself
daintily
from
a
box
of
chocolates
which
her
adorers
had
purchased
for
her
i
want
us
all
said
kathleen
to
give
a
party
to
the
other
queen
and
her
subjects
and
i
want
it
to
be
about
the
very
jolliest
entertainment
that
can
be
found
we
must
of
course
ask
leave
but
she
is
certain
to
give
it
i
do
know
that
she
is
said
maggie
oh
she
is
certain
sure
said
kathleen
may
i
go
and
ask
her
now
do
you
dare
said
rosamond
dacre
looking
at
kitty
radiant
face
with
some
astonishment
dare
cried
irish
kitty
i
do
know
the
meaning
of
anything
that
i
do
dare
i
am
off
i
bring
you
word
in
a
few
minutes
girls
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
janet
burns
looked
after
her
slightly
raising
her
brows
rosamond
dacre
and
the
two
roaches
began
to
sound
her
praises
she
is
sweet
is
she
yes
said
clara
and
i
do
so
love
her
pretty
irish
brogue
mother
tells
me
said
janet
who
was
scotch
that
irish
characters
are
not
much
good
they
not
reliable
i
mean
oh
what
a
shame
said
matty
roache
i
do
think
we
need
discuss
characters
said
maggie
i
do
know
a
great
deal
about
the
irish
but
i
do
know
that
kitty
is
a
darling
yes
so
she
is
one
of
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
whole
school
said
molly
tristram
who
was
quite
as
excited
as
kathleen
herself
with
regard
to
the
party
scheme
meantime
kitty
found
herself
tapping
at
ward
private
door
ward
said
come
in
and
the
pretty
girl
with
her
great
eyes
and
complexion
entered
abruptly
well
kathleen
said
ward
in
her
pleasant
tone
oh
please
ward
i
come
with
such
a
lovely
scheme
and
you
want
me
to
help
you
oh
yes
please
do
say
you
will
before
i
let
you
into
the
secret
i
ca
do
that
dear
you
must
just
tell
me
what
is
in
your
mind
and
be
satisfied
with
my
decision
the
only
thing
that
i
can
assure
you
beforehand
is
that
if
it
is
a
workable
scheme
and
likely
to
give
you
great
pleasure
i
will
do
my
best
to
entertain
it
then
we
certain
to
have
it
certain
said
kathleen
it
was
i
who
thought
of
it
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
speak
out
just
as
plainly
as
possible
of
course
kathleen
dear
well
you
know
you
are
the
that
is
scarcely
news
to
me
my
child
and
people
as
a
rule
continued
kathleen
respect
their
dear
me
said
ward
with
a
smile
have
you
come
here
kathleen
to
say
that
you
do
respect
me
respect
you
said
kathleen
we
do
a
jolly
lot
more
than
that
we
adore
you
we
love
you
you
you
a
sort
of
of
mother
to
us
that
is
what
i
want
to
be
said
ward
with
fervor
and
she
took
the
girl
hand
and
smoothed
it
gently
i
often
want
to
hug
you
and
that
a
fact
said
kathleen
you
may
kiss
me
now
if
you
like
kitty
oh
mrs
ward
kitty
bent
down
and
bestowed
a
reverent
kiss
on
that
sweet
face
i
have
permitted
you
to
kiss
me
kitty
said
ward
in
order
to
show
you
that
i
sympathize
with
you
as
i
do
with
all
my
dear
girls
but
now
what
is
the
matter
well
the
fact
is
this
we
want
during
the
hours
to
give
a
party
is
that
all
do
you
all
want
to
give
a
party
our
side
wants
to
give
a
party
and
we
want
to
invite
the
other
side
to
it
but
what
do
you
mean
by
side
and
other
side
oh
ward
you
know
of
course
you
know
that
aneta
and
maggie
divide
the
school
i
know
said
ward
after
a
pause
that
aneta
has
considerable
influence
and
that
maggie
also
has
influence
those
two
girls
divide
the
school
said
kathleen
the
rest
of
us
follow
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
only
follow
our
leaders
in
the
leisure
hours
but
as
they
come
every
day
a
good
deal
can
be
done
in
that
time
ca
it
yes
said
ward
and
her
tone
was
not
exactly
cheerful
on
which
side
are
you
kitty
oh
dear
ward
of
course
on
maggie
do
you
think
that
a
girl
like
me
with
all
my
spirit
and
that
irresistible
sort
of
fun
always
bubbling
up
in
me
could
stand
the
kitty
you
have
no
right
to
speak
of
any
girls
in
the
school
by
such
an
offensive
term
i
am
sorry
said
kitty
i
ought
not
to
have
said
it
to
you
but
they
are
they
really
are
and
what
do
you
call
yourself
oh
the
that
our
title
but
it
only
quite
among
ourselves
and
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
said
it
i
will
never
repeat
what
you
have
told
me
in
confidence
dear
but
now
for
your
request
well
we
of
maggie
set
want
to
invite
the
aneta
set
to
a
sort
of
general
party
we
should
like
it
to
be
on
the
if
possible
we
want
to
give
them
a
right
royal
entertainment
in
order
to
knock
some
of
their
out
of
them
we
wish
for
your
leave
in
the
matter
you
must
describe
your
entertainment
a
little
more
fully
i
ca
for
we
have
really
and
truly
planned
it
all
out
yet
but
i
tell
you
what
we
do
if
you
give
us
leave
to
have
the
party
we
will
ask
queen
aneta
and
her
satellites
if
possible
this
very
evening
and
then
we
submit
our
programme
to
you
now
may
we
do
this
or
may
we
not
who
sent
you
to
me
kathleen
i
came
of
my
own
very
self
but
of
course
the
others
approved
we
have
no
intention
of
doing
shabby
things
in
the
dark
as
they
do
in
some
schools
that
would
be
unfair
to
you
ward
thought
a
little
longer
i
will
give
you
the
required
permission
she
said
on
one
condition
oh
ward
darling
what
is
that
you
can
have
your
party
on
saturday
week
and
i
will
give
you
from
early
in
the
afternoon
until
bedtime
to
enjoy
it
oh
ward
you
are
too
angelic
stop
a
minute
you
may
not
care
for
it
so
much
when
i
have
finished
what
i
have
got
to
say
what
is
it
dear
mrs
ward
it
is
this
that
you
ask
me
too
as
one
of
your
guests
oh
oh
said
kathleen
her
expressive
face
changed
from
red
to
white
and
then
to
red
again
her
eyes
brimmed
over
with
laughter
and
then
as
suddenly
filled
with
tears
but
would
you
would
you
like
it
yes
and
i
do
want
to
destroy
your
pleasure
but
i
presume
you
will
have
a
sort
of
supper
or
an
entertainment
which
will
include
refreshments
let
me
assist
you
with
the
expense
of
your
supper
and
may
i
be
present
at
it
as
one
of
your
guests
i
will
promise
to
leave
soon
after
supper
and
not
to
appear
until
supper
how
will
that
do
oh
it
would
be
just
heavenly
it
will
give
such
distinction
i
know
the
girls
will
love
it
i
think
i
can
make
myself
pleasant
to
you
all
said
ward
and
i
should
like
to
be
there
but
as
to
paying
anything
ward
you
will
come
as
our
guest
and
you
know
we
have
most
of
us
plenty
of
money
please
please
let
us
do
the
entertaining
very
well
dear
i
will
not
press
that
point
i
hope
i
have
made
you
happy
kathleen
oh
you
have
very
very
happy
indeed
and
saturday
week
is
to
be
the
day
yes
kathleen
kathleen
bent
down
took
one
of
ward
hands
and
kissed
it
then
she
skipped
out
of
the
room
and
flew
back
to
her
companions
they
were
waiting
for
her
in
a
state
of
suppressed
eagerness
well
kathleen
kitty
kit
what
the
news
asked
maggie
room
was
made
for
kathleen
in
the
center
of
the
group
we
have
won
we
may
do
it
she
said
speaking
in
a
low
tone
oh
she
she
like
no
one
else
i
do
know
how
you
will
take
it
girls
but
if
you
not
just
delighted
you
ought
to
be
why
what
you
think
she
wants
to
come
herself
mrs
ward
said
maggie
in
amazement
yes
just
to
supper
she
says
she
will
come
she
wishes
to
come
that
we
to
invite
her
in
fact
she
makes
it
a
quâ
she
will
go
away
again
after
supper
and
we
to
have
the
whole
glorious
day
next
saturday
week
from
two
in
the
afternoon
until
bedtime
oh
we
have
fun
yes
of
course
said
maggie
it
much
better
even
than
i
thought
i
will
write
the
letters
of
invitation
immediately
but
why
should
you
write
a
whole
lot
of
letters
said
kathleen
you
are
one
queen
write
to
the
other
queen
and
mention
that
ward
is
coming
there
was
nothing
like
the
present
time
for
making
arrangements
and
maggie
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
headed
provided
for
her
by
her
satellites
the
following
words
queen
maggie
presents
her
compliments
to
queen
aneta
and
begs
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
with
all
her
subjects
on
saturday
the
of
october
to
an
entertainment
from
three
to
nine
she
hopes
that
the
whole
school
will
be
present
and
writes
in
the
names
of
her
own
subjects
as
well
as
of
herself
ward
has
most
kindly
promised
to
attend
this
letter
was
subjected
to
the
approval
of
the
group
of
girls
who
surrounded
maggie
it
was
then
addressed
to
queen
aneta
and
kathleen
crossed
the
room
with
it
and
dropped
it
there
and
then
into
aneta
lysle
lap
it
caused
very
deep
amazement
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
girls
who
belonged
to
aneta
party
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
they
might
have
refused
to
accept
the
invitation
but
for
that
magical
postscript
ward
has
most
kindly
promised
to
attend
but
there
was
no
withstanding
that
patent
fact
as
ward
knew
very
well
when
she
made
the
proposal
to
kathleen
after
a
lapse
of
about
twenty
minutes
cicely
cardew
crossed
the
room
and
laid
the
answer
to
maggie
note
in
her
lap
queen
aneta
and
her
subjects
have
much
pleasure
in
accepting
queen
maggie
invitation
for
the
inst
hip
hip
hurrah
cried
kathleen
the
thing
arranged
and
have
about
the
jolliest
and
the
most
enticing
time
that
girls
ever
had
at
any
school
she
sprang
from
her
seat
and
began
tossing
a
book
which
had
lain
in
her
lap
into
the
air
catching
it
again
in
short
the
subjects
of
the
two
queens
broke
up
on
the
spot
and
chatted
gaily
together
and
maggie
and
her
subjects
could
not
be
induced
to
say
one
word
of
what
was
to
take
place
on
the
of
october
it
is
wonderful
thought
aneta
to
herself
why
does
ward
come
but
of
course
as
she
comes
we
must
all
come
chapter
xviii
the
treasure
maggie
had
by
no
means
forgotten
her
promise
to
the
tristram
girls
to
give
them
a
bracelet
apiece
it
was
easy
to
do
this
for
they
were
her
very
special
friends
in
the
school
the
fact
is
that
molly
and
belle
had
a
somewhat
peculiar
position
at
aylmer
house
for
they
were
not
only
maggie
special
friends
but
also
the
undoubted
friends
and
allies
of
cicely
merry
and
also
of
aneta
but
they
were
such
pleasant
sort
of
girls
so
lively
so
jolly
that
they
could
take
up
a
position
with
ease
which
would
oppress
and
distress
other
people
when
maggie
presented
them
with
their
bracelets
they
were
in
wild
raptures
accepting
them
gleefully
and
on
occasions
when
ornaments
were
permitted
to
be
worn
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
only
in
the
leisure
hours
they
invariably
had
them
on
their
arms
but
other
girls
noticed
them
and
one
and
all
admired
them
immensely
oh
i
have
others
said
maggie
in
a
careless
tone
many
more
my
dear
father
was
a
great
traveler
and
these
are
some
of
the
treasures
he
brought
from
the
east
maggie
had
by
no
means
forgotten
to
bring
her
two
boxes
of
jewellery
to
aylmer
house
these
lay
at
the
bottom
of
her
little
trunk
which
was
it
is
true
stowed
away
in
the
but
as
the
girls
were
at
liberty
to
go
there
for
anything
they
especially
required
she
was
not
troubled
on
this
account
there
came
a
day
shortly
after
the
great
party
was
arranged
when
the
rain
poured
incessantly
and
some
of
the
girls
were
a
little
restless
molly
and
isabel
were
wearing
their
queer
oriental
bracelets
kathleen
suddenly
caught
sight
of
them
and
demanded
in
an
eager
tone
that
maggie
should
exhibit
her
treasures
maggie
only
too
pleased
to
have
anything
to
do
which
glorified
herself
immediately
complied
she
ran
to
find
miss
lucy
in
order
to
obtain
the
key
of
the
what
do
you
want
it
for
dear
said
miss
johnson
in
her
pleasant
voice
i
have
two
boxes
in
the
bottom
of
one
of
my
trunks
miss
lucy
they
are
full
of
curiosities
which
my
father
collected
from
time
to
time
the
girls
want
to
see
them
do
you
mind
my
showing
them
of
course
not
maggie
but
if
they
are
of
any
value
you
had
better
give
them
to
ward
to
take
care
of
for
you
oh
well
said
maggie
i
do
know
really
whether
they
are
of
value
or
not
she
got
rather
red
as
she
spoke
i
should
like
to
see
them
myself
said
miss
johnson
i
know
a
little
bit
about
gems
and
curios
certainly
miss
lucy
do
come
said
maggie
we
in
our
and
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
to
show
them
to
you
maggie
fetched
down
her
two
precious
boxes
and
soon
she
was
surrounded
not
only
by
her
own
special
satellites
but
by
every
girl
in
the
school
they
were
all
loud
in
their
expressions
of
rapture
at
the
unique
and
lovely
things
which
she
exhibited
to
them
kathleen
as
usual
was
quick
in
suggestion
would
not
ward
love
to
see
them
she
said
i
am
sure
she
would
remarked
miss
i
had
the
least
idea
maggie
that
you
had
such
treasures
in
those
old
tin
boxes
they
must
be
carefully
put
away
in
the
safe
for
you
my
dear
girl
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
oh
i
do
suppose
they
are
said
maggie
trying
to
speak
carelessly
although
she
by
no
means
wished
to
part
with
her
treasures
i
tell
you
what
said
kathleen
ca
we
make
an
exhibition
of
them
on
day
yes
why
not
said
molly
and
isabel
that
would
be
quite
lovely
oh
yes
do
do
maggie
darling
said
merry
cardew
maggie
at
once
agreed
and
miss
johnson
said
now
if
you
will
put
them
all
back
in
their
boxes
i
will
take
them
and
lock
them
into
the
safe
myself
i
should
have
an
easy
moment
if
i
thought
such
valuable
things
were
in
one
of
your
oh
said
maggie
looking
up
with
flushed
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
please
please
let
me
keep
them
until
after
our
party
then
we
will
consult
ward
and
she
will
tell
me
what
to
do
if
you
must
keep
them
then
maggie
said
miss
johnson
you
had
better
have
them
in
your
own
bedroom
they
would
be
at
least
safe
there
put
them
into
your
locked
drawer
dear
i
think
it
will
hold
both
these
boxes
thank
you
very
much
said
maggie
she
put
the
ten
bracelets
into
their
tin
box
and
the
necklets
and
other
curios
into
the
other
locked
each
and
took
them
upstairs
it
would
never
never
do
she
said
to
herself
for
me
to
lose
control
of
these
precious
things
i
am
almost
sorry
now
that
i
allowed
the
girls
to
tempt
me
to
show
them
after
a
few
minutes
she
came
downstairs
her
stepfather
allowance
of
was
certainly
not
ample
and
she
knew
that
at
the
party
which
was
to
be
so
specially
distinguished
she
must
give
if
she
wished
to
keep
up
her
prestige
in
the
school
a
lion
share
towards
the
expenses
there
was
a
quaint
little
brooch
in
one
of
her
boxes
containing
one
large
ruby
and
set
with
diamonds
which
she
intended
to
sell
in
order
to
provide
herself
with
funds
but
what
use
would
any
of
her
treasures
be
if
they
were
consigned
to
the
safe
at
aylmer
house
after
a
great
deal
of
consultation
it
was
resolved
that
the
girls
were
to
meet
in
their
own
special
at
four
where
tea
and
light
refreshments
were
to
be
provided
by
queen
maggie
and
her
subjects
afterwards
they
were
to
play
games
have
recitations
and
amuse
themselves
in
different
ways
until
five
when
a
curtain
which
would
be
put
across
a
portion
of
the
room
would
be
raised
and
tableaux
vivants
in
which
maggie
kathleen
and
both
the
tristram
girls
who
were
all
adaptable
for
this
purpose
were
to
take
special
parts
the
tableaux
were
under
the
management
of
janet
burns
who
was
exceedingly
clever
and
had
studied
the
scenes
which
she
took
from
different
episodes
in
scott
novels
with
great
care
the
rehearsing
for
the
tableaux
was
a
little
difficult
but
this
was
done
each
evening
after
tea
when
maggie
and
her
subjects
had
the
to
themselves
immediately
after
the
tableaux
there
would
be
that
wonderful
supper
at
which
ward
was
to
be
the
principal
guest
and
then
the
happy
evening
would
end
with
all
sorts
of
dances
and
frolics
now
all
these
things
would
cost
money
and
it
was
arranged
after
brief
consultation
that
each
girl
was
to
subscribe
in
an
equal
ratio
towards
the
proposed
entertainment
janet
who
had
a
head
for
figures
as
well
as
a
taste
for
tableaux
vivants
suggested
that
to
do
the
entertainment
properly
they
would
have
to
expend
something
like
fifteen
shillings
each
this
was
immediately
agreed
upon
and
even
the
tristrams
did
not
feel
embarrassed
by
the
amount
which
was
decided
upon
for
tristram
was
wise
in
his
generation
and
would
not
send
his
girls
to
an
expensive
school
if
he
could
not
give
them
a
sufficient
supply
of
to
make
them
feel
independent
the
only
person
who
was
short
of
funds
on
this
occasion
was
maggie
for
her
stepfather
had
arranged
that
she
was
to
receive
her
allowance
at
the
end
of
the
term
not
at
the
beginning
he
had
given
her
a
few
shillings
to
go
to
school
with
but
these
she
had
already
spent
on
chocolates
which
were
considered
essential
during
the
leisure
hours
it
is
true
that
ward
would
have
advanced
a
little
money
to
maggie
but
maggie
could
not
bear
to
ask
her
she
had
a
great
dislike
to
the
subject
of
money
being
mentioned
in
ward
presence
she
was
afraid
beyond
everything
else
that
the
fact
of
her
being
received
at
such
a
select
school
for
forty
pounds
a
year
might
reach
the
ears
of
her
what
more
easy
than
to
sell
that
charming
little
oriental
brooch
which
was
one
of
the
treasures
in
one
of
those
tin
boxes
but
maggie
could
not
manage
this
in
miss
lucy
presence
and
it
was
quite
against
the
rules
at
aylmer
house
for
any
girl
to
go
shopping
or
even
to
leave
the
house
unaccompanied
on
one
or
two
previous
occasions
maggie
had
however
managed
to
evade
this
rule
without
being
found
out
and
she
thought
she
could
do
so
now
she
planned
the
whole
thing
rather
cleverly
she
had
a
room
to
herself
which
of
course
made
it
easier
for
her
and
there
were
always
the
leisure
hours
she
made
up
her
mind
to
feign
headache
or
some
slight
indisposition
to
go
downstairs
by
the
back
way
and
sell
her
brooch
on
a
certain
afternoon
during
the
leisure
hours
she
must
do
it
quickly
for
the
girls
had
proposed
to
put
the
necessary
money
for
the
entertainment
into
a
bag
on
a
certain
tuesday
maggie
must
therefore
go
out
on
monday
in
order
to
sell
her
brooch
her
absence
from
the
little
party
in
the
girls
was
explained
by
molly
tristram
who
said
that
maggie
was
upstairs
lying
down
no
one
troubled
to
make
any
comment
with
regard
to
this
any
girl
might
have
a
headache
and
ward
did
not
wish
her
girls
to
be
catechised
as
to
how
they
spent
their
leisure
hours
besides
janet
burns
was
occupying
all
their
attention
with
the
tableaux
vivants
queen
girls
most
leaving
them
the
to
themselves
for
this
purpose
maggie
in
her
distant
bedroom
felt
the
quiet
in
the
house
she
had
been
lying
down
now
she
rose
noiselessly
this
was
the
time
when
the
servants
had
their
tea
when
ward
was
busy
writing
letters
or
resting
in
her
own
when
lucy
johnson
and
the
other
governesses
were
either
reposing
in
their
bedrooms
or
were
out
or
were
reading
there
was
of
course
the
chance
that
maggie
might
meet
some
one
but
having
calculated
all
possibilities
she
thought
that
she
could
most
likely
get
out
unobserved
during
her
expeditions
with
miss
lucy
johnson
she
had
noticed
a
jeweller
shop
not
far
away
and
resolved
to
go
to
him
with
her
precious
brooch
it
was
a
very
respectable
shop
and
she
was
certain
he
would
give
her
fair
value
she
could
be
back
again
before
she
was
missed
and
in
fact
could
join
her
companions
in
the
long
before
the
leisure
hours
had
expired
the
days
were
now
getting
very
short
but
this
fact
was
in
maggie
favor
rather
than
otherwise
she
ran
downstairs
unnoticed
by
any
one
opened
a
which
was
used
as
a
tradesmen
entrance
and
got
into
the
street
then
putting
wings
to
her
feet
she
quickly
turned
the
corner
left
the
square
where
aylmer
house
was
situated
and
reached
the
jeweller
shop
she
entered
there
were
a
few
people
standing
by
the
counter
and
the
jeweller
a
certain
pearce
was
attending
to
them
maggie
felt
impatient
she
awaited
her
turn
as
best
she
could
how
she
disliked
those
people
who
were
purchasing
goods
of
some
value
whereas
she
only
wanted
to
sell
she
could
scarcely
restrain
her
great
impatience
and
was
relieved
when
another
shopman
came
forward
he
asked
her
what
he
could
do
for
her
she
immediately
showed
him
the
quaint
little
brooch
set
with
rubies
and
diamonds
i
want
to
sell
this
said
maggie
speaking
abruptly
and
the
color
flaming
into
her
cheeks
what
will
you
give
me
for
it
oh
my
suddenly
exclaimed
one
of
the
ladies
who
was
purchasing
jewels
in
pearce
shop
what
a
lovely
curio
wherever
now
did
you
get
it
from
maggie
turned
and
said
in
a
low
tone
it
belongs
to
me
it
was
left
to
me
by
my
father
the
man
who
was
attending
to
maggie
took
up
the
brooch
and
examined
it
carefully
he
took
it
into
another
room
where
he
subjected
it
to
various
tests
he
then
came
back
to
maggie
i
will
give
you
five
pounds
for
this
miss
if
you
can
satisfy
me
that
you
have
come
rightly
by
it
oh
my
said
the
american
lady
drawing
near
and
her
eyes
glistening
what
is
your
address
miss
maggie
by
no
means
wished
to
give
her
address
i
have
stolen
that
brooch
she
said
it
belongs
to
me
i
have
a
right
to
sell
it
of
course
miss
i
shall
never
trouble
you
in
any
way
but
i
really
must
have
your
address
in
purchasing
secondhand
from
young
ladies
like
yourself
it
is
essential
that
everything
should
be
and
quite
correct
well
said
maggie
in
a
hurried
voice
take
the
brooch
and
give
me
the
money
i
must
get
back
as
quickly
as
i
can
i
am
one
of
ward
pupils
at
aylmer
house
the
man
looked
at
maggie
with
all
respect
and
your
own
name
howland
said
maggie
miss
howland
the
man
entered
name
and
address
in
his
book
and
then
handed
maggie
five
sovereigns
she
was
hurrying
from
the
shop
when
the
customer
who
had
been
standing
near
all
the
time
and
listening
with
great
attention
followed
her
i
say
young
lady
she
exclaimed
i
am
from
new
york
and
i
like
your
quaint
old
english
things
that
man
cheated
you
i
take
it
if
you
had
offered
me
that
brooch
i
have
given
you
fifteen
pounds
for
it
not
five
if
you
have
any
more
curios
to
sell
my
address
is
miss
annie
lapham
langham
hotel
i
am
straight
from
the
states
and
would
like
to
take
a
collection
of
beautiful
things
home
with
me
thank
you
said
maggie
in
a
hurried
voice
she
ran
back
to
aylmer
house
as
quickly
as
she
could
as
soon
as
she
was
quite
out
of
sight
the
lady
the
shop
say
she
remarked
to
the
shopman
i
witnessed
that
little
transaction
between
you
and
miss
howland
i
want
to
buy
that
brooch
for
ten
pounds
i
am
sorry
madam
said
the
man
but
it
is
not
for
sale
just
at
present
that
means
said
miss
lapham
coloring
crimson
that
you
have
cheated
the
young
lady
you
ought
to
have
given
her
four
times
as
much
for
the
brooch
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
miss
lapham
grew
redder
than
ever
i
happen
to
know
miss
address
she
said
then
she
went
away
without
giving
him
time
to
add
a
word
when
she
had
left
the
shop
the
younger
pearce
turned
to
his
brother
took
the
little
brooch
from
the
drawer
into
which
he
had
carelessly
thrown
it
and
gave
it
to
the
elder
pearce
to
examine
there
a
find
here
he
said
only
somehow
i
feel
a
bit
uncomfortable
how
did
one
of
the
young
ladies
from
aylmer
house
come
by
a
treasure
of
this
sort
the
other
man
examined
the
brooch
carefully
it
worth
a
good
bit
he
said
what
did
you
give
her
for
it
five
pounds
but
somehow
i
think
that
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
it
for
that
sum
it
is
worth
at
least
two
hundred
said
the
elder
pearce
where
did
you
say
she
lived
she
is
one
of
the
young
ladies
at
aylmer
house
miss
howland
what
from
ward
school
yes
you
had
better
give
me
that
brooch
alfred
said
his
brother
have
to
consider
what
is
to
be
done
we
ca
rob
the
young
lady
of
it
we
had
best
consult
mrs
ward
oh
as
to
that
said
the
younger
pearce
that
sounds
almost
as
shabby
as
giving
the
schoolgirl
too
little
money
well
lock
it
up
for
the
present
said
the
elder
pearce
but
i
am
an
honest
tradesman
and
i
ca
see
even
a
schoolgirl
robbed
she
was
up
to
some
little
lark
said
the
younger
man
and
evidently
did
not
know
the
value
of
the
brooch
why
i
think
she
have
taken
a
pound
for
it
but
what
she
did
know
the
value
of
was
her
precious
time
she
was
very
much
annoyed
at
being
kept
waiting
and
at
being
asked
for
her
address
it
is
plain
she
got
out
without
leave
and
although
the
brooch
may
belong
to
her
i
am
sure
i
hope
it
does
she
has
broken
a
rule
you
mark
my
words
those
schoolgirls
are
always
up
to
larks
well
i
never
have
thought
it
of
one
of
girls
it
is
a
pity
you
did
consult
me
alfred
said
his
brother
the
best
thing
to
do
now
is
to
put
the
brooch
carefully
away
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
with
it
but
as
to
giving
the
young
lady
only
five
pounds
for
what
we
can
sell
any
day
at
christie
for
a
couple
of
hundred
that
is
not
to
be
thought
of
chapter
xix
the
letter
maggie
got
out
and
came
back
again
without
any
apparent
adventure
she
had
five
pounds
in
her
pocket
and
thought
herself
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
what
a
delightful
had
been
handed
down
to
her
by
her
dear
dead
father
she
did
not
miss
the
brooch
in
the
least
but
she
valued
the
small
sum
she
had
obtained
for
it
exceedingly
but
while
maggie
thought
herself
so
secure
and
while
the
pleasant
jingle
of
the
sovereigns
as
she
touched
them
with
her
little
hand
comforted
her
inexpressibly
things
quite
against
maggie
supposed
interests
were
transpiring
in
another
part
of
the
school
it
was
a
strange
fact
that
on
this
special
afternoon
both
the
queens
should
be
prostrated
with
headache
it
is
true
that
queen
headache
was
only
a
fiction
but
poor
queen
aneta
was
real
enough
she
was
lying
down
in
her
pretty
bedroom
hoping
that
quiet
might
still
the
throbbing
of
her
temples
when
the
door
was
very
softly
opened
and
merry
cardew
brought
in
a
letter
and
laid
it
by
her
side
may
i
bring
you
some
tea
upstairs
aneta
she
said
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
oh
no
darling
said
aneta
i
ca
eat
or
drink
but
if
i
stay
very
still
i
shall
be
better
leave
me
now
dear
all
i
want
is
perfect
quiet
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
aneta
said
merry
what
are
you
doing
downstairs
said
aneta
as
the
girl
turned
away
well
maggie
has
a
headache
too
oh
said
aneta
so
we
are
without
our
queens
continued
merry
but
maggie
girls
have
taken
possession
of
our
and
we
are
all
in
the
schoolroom
we
having
great
fun
and
are
very
happy
so
do
worry
about
us
at
all
aneta
i
wo
said
aneta
closing
her
eyes
while
a
feeling
of
drowsy
relief
stole
over
her
her
anxiety
with
regard
to
maggie
was
really
making
her
ill
her
sense
of
responsibility
with
reference
to
the
cardew
girls
seemed
to
oppress
her
usually
calm
spirit
she
could
not
conceal
the
fact
from
herself
that
merry
loved
maggie
most
passionately
the
knowledge
therefore
that
maggie
was
not
downstairs
gave
her
such
a
sense
of
comfort
that
she
dropped
into
a
doze
and
when
she
awoke
a
short
time
afterwards
her
headache
was
gone
yes
her
headache
had
departed
but
there
lay
by
her
pillow
what
is
a
great
treasure
to
all
schoolgirls
an
unopened
letter
she
looked
at
the
handwriting
and
saw
that
it
was
from
her
aunt
lady
lysle
aneta
was
very
fond
of
lady
lysle
and
sitting
up
against
her
pillows
she
tore
open
the
letter
and
began
to
read
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
dated
from
meredith
manor
my
dear
aneta
it
ran
i
have
been
staying
with
the
dear
cardews
for
the
last
week
we
have
been
having
a
very
pleasant
time
although
of
course
the
house
is
vastly
different
without
cicely
and
merry
but
the
dear
cardews
are
so
sensible
that
they
never
would
regret
anything
that
was
for
the
real
benefit
of
their
children
your
letter
assuring
me
that
the
children
were
happy
at
school
gave
me
great
delight
and
when
i
told
the
cardews
they
were
equally
pleased
altogether
this
seems
likely
to
turn
out
most
satisfactory
and
the
dear
children
will
be
properly
equipped
for
the
brilliant
life
which
lies
before
them
but
now
i
have
a
curious
piece
of
information
for
you
you
told
me
about
miss
howland
and
her
mother
second
marriage
to
one
of
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
well
dear
we
went
there
yesterday
and
i
happened
incidentally
to
speak
on
the
subject
and
whatever
may
be
the
position
of
miss
howland
stepfather
he
certainly
is
no
relation
to
our
dear
friends
the
martyns
they
have
no
uncles
or
cousins
in
england
at
all
all
their
people
come
from
australia
and
they
assured
me
that
such
a
marriage
as
i
have
described
has
in
the
first
place
never
reached
their
ears
and
in
the
next
is
impossible
for
they
have
no
marriageable
relations
in
the
country
i
mention
this
to
show
that
your
friend
has
made
a
mistake
at
the
same
time
it
is
strange
of
her
to
say
that
her
mother
has
married
into
such
a
and
distinguished
family
i
can
add
no
more
yours
with
love
and
in
haste
lucia
lysle
aneta
thought
over
this
letter
for
some
time
her
face
was
very
grave
as
she
tried
to
put
two
and
two
together
she
rose
from
her
bed
dressed
herself
with
her
usual
immaculate
neatness
and
came
down
to
supper
which
took
place
each
evening
at
seven
all
the
girls
were
present
and
each
and
all
were
in
the
best
of
maggie
was
radiant
why
not
she
had
performed
a
difficult
task
discreetly
and
she
had
five
lovely
golden
sovereigns
in
her
drawer
upstairs
she
could
put
the
required
money
into
the
bag
for
the
and
she
would
have
plenty
over
to
buy
chocolates
and
little
things
that
she
might
require
for
herself
she
did
not
in
the
least
miss
that
one
small
brooch
which
her
father
had
left
her
but
she
thought
with
a
feeling
of
intense
satisfaction
of
her
treasures
she
need
no
longer
be
a
penniless
girl
she
had
but
at
rare
intervals
to
visit
pearce
the
jeweler
and
her
pocket
would
be
well
lined
she
had
no
romantic
feeling
with
regard
to
those
beautiful
things
which
her
father
had
collected
on
his
travels
she
had
been
so
poor
all
her
life
that
money
to
her
represented
power
she
even
thought
of
getting
a
couple
of
new
dresses
made
by
a
fashionable
dressmaker
she
resolved
to
consult
lucy
on
the
subject
she
was
never
quite
as
well
dressed
as
the
other
girls
although
very
plain
clothes
were
the
order
of
the
hour
at
school
immediately
after
supper
those
girls
who
required
to
look
over
their
lessons
went
into
the
schoolroom
and
spent
a
quiet
time
there
but
the
others
as
a
rule
joined
ward
in
the
there
those
who
could
play
were
requested
to
do
so
and
those
who
could
sing
did
likewise
ward
was
very
fond
of
needlework
she
could
do
rare
and
wonderful
embroideries
and
knew
some
of
the
tapestry
stitches
which
were
in
vogue
hundreds
of
years
ago
the
girls
who
cared
to
be
taught
those
things
she
was
only
too
glad
to
instruct
but
she
never
pressed
any
one
into
her
this
was
always
an
hour
of
relaxation
for
those
girls
who
had
all
their
lessons
ready
for
the
following
day
maggie
who
was
exceedingly
clever
and
learned
with
the
utmost
ease
was
generally
a
member
of
the
coterie
she
wore
a
white
dress
on
this
evening
with
a
somewhat
crude
pink
sash
round
her
waist
she
hated
the
crudity
of
the
color
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
get
some
soft
and
becoming
sashes
out
of
part
of
the
money
which
pearce
had
given
her
for
the
brooch
she
found
herself
near
aneta
aneta
was
working
a
which
she
meant
to
present
to
lady
lysle
at
christmas
maggie
was
no
good
whatever
at
needlework
and
seldom
joined
the
band
of
needlewomen
but
aneta
now
motioned
the
girl
to
come
and
sit
by
her
side
maggie
did
so
aneta
looked
full
in
her
face
is
your
headache
better
maggie
she
asked
maggie
had
to
reflect
for
a
time
she
had
so
absolutely
forgotten
that
she
had
pretended
to
have
a
headache
that
afternoon
then
she
said
with
a
slight
flush
and
a
suspicious
narrowing
of
her
eyes
oh
yes
thank
you
i
am
quite
all
right
again
maggie
had
not
heard
of
aneta
headache
she
therefore
did
not
ask
about
it
i
pity
people
who
have
headaches
said
aneta
i
suffer
from
them
very
badly
myself
nothing
cures
me
but
perfect
rest
i
was
lying
down
all
the
afternoon
merry
came
to
see
me
and
told
me
that
you
were
also
prostrated
with
headache
i
was
sorry
for
you
oh
thank
you
so
much
said
maggie
mine
is
quite
gone
is
yours
yes
thank
you
aneta
sat
quiet
and
very
still
when
her
face
was
in
repose
she
never
moved
her
body
there
was
an
absolute
sense
of
rest
about
her
which
was
refreshing
to
those
who
really
knew
her
well
but
maggie
hated
it
she
wanted
to
leave
her
she
wanted
to
go
and
talk
to
merry
who
was
playing
a
solitary
game
of
patience
in
a
distant
part
of
the
she
wanted
to
do
anything
rather
than
remain
by
side
then
aneta
looked
up
i
had
a
letter
this
afternoon
from
my
aunt
lady
lysle
oh
said
maggie
she
could
not
quite
understand
why
her
heart
beat
so
fast
but
she
had
undoubtedly
a
premonition
of
some
sort
of
trouble
ahead
aunt
lucia
is
staying
with
the
cardews
continued
aneta
is
she
said
maggie
oh
that
sweet
and
beautiful
place
she
continued
yes
said
aneta
meredith
manor
will
always
be
lovely
there
is
no
season
of
the
year
when
it
is
not
in
my
opinion
more
charming
than
any
other
place
i
know
is
your
aunt
going
to
stay
there
long
asked
maggie
who
felt
that
she
need
not
say
anything
further
with
regard
to
the
delights
of
meredith
manor
just
now
i
can
not
tell
you
replied
aneta
she
mentioned
something
rather
curious
it
is
connected
with
you
with
poor
little
me
said
maggie
with
you
said
aneta
you
remember
telling
me
that
your
stepfather
is
one
of
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
maggie
face
grew
crimson
then
turned
pale
well
said
aneta
bringing
out
her
words
with
great
calmness
it
turns
out
to
be
a
mistake
your
stepfather
is
no
relation
whatever
to
our
friends
the
martyns
aunt
lucia
and
cardew
went
to
call
on
them
the
other
day
and
asked
the
question
you
made
a
mistake
in
announcing
your
stepfather
as
being
a
connection
of
our
friends
did
i
perhaps
so
said
maggie
i
thought
he
was
that
all
you
thought
wrong
said
aneta
i
felt
i
would
mention
it
to
you
he
may
be
just
as
well
connected
she
added
quietly
but
he
is
related
to
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
you
speak
in
a
very
disagreeable
tone
said
maggie
i
do
mean
to
replied
aneta
but
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
in
order
that
you
should
not
spread
the
report
any
further
i
am
sure
i
do
want
to
my
stepfather
has
just
as
good
connections
as
any
one
else
no
doubt
said
aneta
gently
only
he
is
not
related
to
our
special
friends
you
might
let
merry
and
cicely
know
why
asked
maggie
in
a
dogged
voice
you
can
please
yourself
i
shall
tell
them
if
you
do
why
do
you
hate
me
so
much
aneta
said
maggie
then
i
hate
subterfuge
and
untruth
said
aneta
i
do
hate
you
if
you
would
be
straight
and
open
and
you
would
find
me
your
best
friend
thank
you
so
much
said
maggie
in
a
sneering
tone
when
i
require
you
for
my
best
friend
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
offer
me
that
enviable
position
then
she
added
speaking
in
a
low
tone
of
intense
dislike
is
it
likely
that
any
girl
would
wish
to
make
a
best
friend
of
another
girl
who
accused
her
of
subterfuge
and
want
of
truthfulness
the
delicate
pink
rose
in
aneta
cheeks
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
full
up
at
maggie
her
clear
calm
eyes
seemed
like
mirrors
maggie
felt
that
she
could
not
meet
them
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
cicely
cardew
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
came
into
the
room
maggie
she
said
coming
straight
up
to
maggie
howland
there
a
very
large
parcel
addressed
to
you
in
the
hall
it
has
been
paid
for
we
are
all
dying
with
curiosity
to
know
what
it
is
maggie
rose
abruptly
i
will
go
and
look
at
it
myself
she
said
a
large
parcel
addressed
to
me
who
can
have
sent
me
anything
it
looks
like
a
huge
said
cicely
we
all
curious
about
it
before
any
girl
could
leave
the
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
ask
ward
permission
so
maggie
now
went
up
to
that
good
lady
and
asked
if
she
might
go
and
look
at
her
parcel
a
parcel
for
you
dear
said
ward
and
you
want
to
see
its
contents
but
bring
it
in
here
we
shall
all
be
delighted
to
look
at
it
we
girls
maggie
went
away
wondering
a
good
deal
cicely
accompanied
her
miss
johnson
also
appeared
on
the
scene
why
maggie
she
said
what
can
you
have
got
such
a
huge
box
and
all
covered
over
with
brown
paper
i
do
suppose
ward
would
really
like
that
box
to
be
brought
into
the
i
just
go
and
ask
her
one
of
ward
peculiarities
and
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
was
such
a
favorite
and
led
her
girls
with
such
gentle
silken
cords
was
her
power
of
entering
into
their
pleasures
she
used
to
confess
with
a
smile
that
she
was
like
a
child
herself
over
an
unopened
parcel
and
when
miss
johnson
appeared
with
the
information
that
the
box
was
large
and
cumbersome
ward
still
gave
directions
that
it
was
to
be
brought
into
the
you
can
put
some
of
the
brown
paper
on
the
floor
if
you
like
lucy
she
said
and
maggie
can
show
us
its
contents
now
one
glance
at
the
parcel
told
maggie
howland
who
had
sent
it
she
recognized
her
stepfather
writing
that
bold
commercial
hand
was
painfully
visible
on
the
label
she
would
have
given
worlds
not
to
have
anything
selected
for
her
by
martin
exhibited
in
the
at
aylmer
house
but
to
refuse
to
show
the
contents
of
the
box
would
but
raise
strong
suspicion
against
her
she
therefore
although
very
unwillingly
followed
miss
johnson
into
the
the
box
was
laid
on
the
floor
the
lid
was
removed
some
was
next
extricated
and
beneath
lay
a
wardrobe
such
as
poor
maggie
even
in
her
wildest
dreams
had
never
imagined
there
was
a
letter
lying
on
the
top
which
she
clutched
and
put
into
her
pocket
this
letter
was
in
her
stepfather
writing
she
could
not
read
it
before
the
others
aneta
and
all
the
girls
of
her
set
also
kathleen
rosamond
dacre
matty
and
clara
roache
janet
barns
the
tristrams
the
cardews
all
clustered
round
the
box
oh
what
fun
said
kathleen
a
box
of
dresses
for
you
you
lucky
queen
maggie
how
i
wish
some
one
would
send
me
some
clothes
take
them
out
dear
and
let
us
look
at
them
said
ward
the
first
dress
to
be
removed
was
a
magenta
cachemire
it
was
made
with
a
short
skirt
trimmed
with
little
frills
of
the
same
the
bodice
had
sleeves
to
the
elbows
and
long
coarse
lace
sleeves
below
the
front
of
the
dress
was
also
much
bedizened
by
the
same
coarse
cream
lace
maggie
felt
her
face
nearly
purple
with
rage
oh
why
must
all
these
things
be
looked
at
here
she
said
and
there
was
a
piteous
note
in
her
voice
i
do
see
the
necessity
dear
said
ward
kindly
but
oh
please
please
said
kathleen
we
see
the
others
here
a
dress
trimmed
with
bands
of
black
silk
that
will
be
quite
useful
in
the
winter
wo
it
mags
she
tried
to
speak
kindly
for
the
dress
was
as
little
to
her
taste
as
the
impossible
magenta
under
the
two
dresses
were
ribbons
of
different
shades
and
hues
some
strong
coarse
stockings
some
shoes
and
finally
below
everything
else
an
made
of
voile
and
deep
blue
in
tone
some
of
the
things
will
he
very
useful
said
miss
johnson
i
will
put
them
all
back
again
now
but
whom
have
they
come
from
said
ward
i
saw
you
take
a
note
and
put
it
into
your
pocket
maggie
yes
these
are
a
present
from
my
stepfather
said
maggie
miss
johnson
you
will
take
them
upstairs
wo
you
said
mrs
it
is
kind
of
your
stepfather
to
think
of
you
maggie
maggie
looked
up
and
met
aneta
glance
was
aneta
thinking
of
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
the
color
rushed
all
over
maggie
face
she
clenched
her
hands
i
hate
the
horrid
horrid
things
she
said
i
wo
wear
one
of
them
oh
come
dear
said
ward
kindly
your
stepfather
means
very
well
indeed
by
you
he
has
doubtless
had
very
little
to
do
with
dressing
a
lady
we
can
slightly
alter
those
dresses
can
we
not
miss
johnson
miss
johnson
had
now
placed
all
the
hideous
garments
back
in
the
box
she
said
with
a
smile
the
dress
can
be
made
quite
useful
but
i
rather
despair
of
the
magenta
well
said
ward
it
was
meant
kindly
perhaps
maggie
if
you
gave
me
your
stepfather
address
i
might
write
to
him
and
tell
him
the
sort
of
things
that
i
like
my
girls
to
wear
maggie
turned
crimson
that
would
indeed
be
the
final
straw
she
murmured
something
which
ward
did
not
choose
to
hear
to
her
great
relief
the
hour
for
bed
had
arrived
and
all
the
girls
went
to
their
rooms
miss
johnson
came
down
again
after
she
had
deposited
the
hideous
dresses
in
maggie
wardrobe
i
quite
pity
poor
little
maggie
she
said
what
frightful
taste
there
is
really
nothing
in
the
whole
of
that
box
that
she
can
possibly
wear
i
must
write
to
martyn
said
ward
did
somebody
tell
me
that
he
was
a
country
gentleman
a
relation
of
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
such
particularly
nice
people
i
know
nothing
about
that
said
miss
johnson
i
only
know
that
the
contents
of
the
box
are
simply
atrocious
well
said
ward
we
wo
say
anything
to
annoy
maggie
i
could
see
that
the
poor
dear
child
was
greatly
mortified
i
only
regret
that
i
had
the
box
opened
here
but
you
know
it
is
one
of
our
customs
to
share
all
our
pleasures
poor
little
maggie
the
thing
was
most
unlucky
up
in
her
room
maggie
had
locked
her
door
she
would
unlock
it
again
but
she
must
read
that
frightful
letter
without
any
chance
of
being
disturbed
she
opened
it
tore
it
from
its
envelope
and
read
the
contents
dear
popsy
i
came
across
a
cheap
lot
of
frocks
the
other
day
at
a
bankrupt
sale
and
thought
at
once
of
and
her
daughter
i
am
sending
the
dresses
off
to
you
without
saying
a
word
to
you
will
be
well
off
now
for
some
time
and
wo
require
the
five
pounds
from
me
for
dress
at
christmas
hope
you
enjoying
your
fine
young
ladies
and
fine
life
neither
nor
me
miss
you
a
bit
but
all
the
same
your
room
will
be
ready
for
you
at
christmas
take
care
of
those
good
clothes
for
i
ca
often
spend
as
much
on
you
for
the
your
affectionate
father
i
have
a
good
mind
to
call
on
that
schoolmistress
of
yours
ward
there
no
saying
but
that
and
me
may
come
along
some
afternoon
when
you
least
expect
us
maggie
crushed
the
letter
in
her
hand
fresh
terrors
seemed
to
surround
her
dreadful
as
the
impossible
clothes
were
they
were
nothing
to
what
the
appearance
on
the
scene
would
be
of
the
impossible
stepfather
and
her
poor
mother
oh
why
had
she
concealed
the
position
of
the
man
whom
her
mother
had
married
already
aneta
had
detected
her
little
act
of
deception
with
regard
to
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
but
that
maggie
felt
could
be
got
over
it
was
easy
for
a
girl
to
make
a
mistake
in
a
matter
of
that
kind
and
surely
there
were
other
martyns
in
the
country
and
respectable
and
all
that
was
desirable
but
james
martin
who
kept
a
grocer
shop
at
shepherd
bush
james
martin
with
grocer
written
all
over
him
rich
it
is
true
but
oh
so
vulgarly
rich
were
he
to
appear
and
announce
his
relationship
to
her
at
the
school
she
felt
that
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
the
end
of
the
world
would
have
arrived
what
was
she
to
do
there
was
not
a
minute
to
be
lost
in
one
way
or
another
she
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
during
the
last
half
of
those
dreadful
summer
holidays
and
she
knew
that
he
was
as
he
expressed
it
as
good
as
his
word
her
only
chance
was
in
writing
to
her
mother
but
then
if
by
any
chance
maggie
letter
got
into
the
hands
of
his
wrath
would
be
so
great
that
he
would
in
all
probability
take
her
from
the
school
at
once
what
was
to
be
done
poor
maggie
felt
herself
between
two
fires
in
either
direction
was
danger
on
the
whole
she
resolved
to
throw
herself
on
her
mother
mercy
martin
as
she
was
now
would
much
prefer
maggie
to
remain
at
school
and
she
might
be
clever
enough
to
keep
maggie
stepfather
from
putting
in
an
appearance
at
aylmer
house
maggie
wrote
a
short
and
frantic
letter
she
was
in
the
midst
of
it
when
there
came
a
tap
at
her
it
i
maggie
said
miss
johnson
voice
from
without
your
light
is
still
burning
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
maggie
flew
and
opened
the
door
i
am
sorry
she
said
i
was
a
good
deal
upset
about
those
detestable
clothes
i
am
writing
to
my
mother
please
lucy
let
me
finish
the
letter
when
it
done
and
i
wo
be
a
minute
longer
i
put
it
in
the
myself
so
that
it
can
go
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
very
well
dear
said
lucy
who
was
too
kind
not
to
be
good
to
any
girl
in
the
school
only
be
quick
maggie
she
said
for
you
know
you
are
breaking
the
rules
yes
oh
yes
said
maggie
and
i
will
never
do
it
again
miss
johnson
left
her
and
maggie
flew
back
to
bend
over
her
paper
and
continue
her
writing
darling
you
must
not
let
him
come
here
he
threatens
to
come
but
you
must
keep
him
away
all
will
be
up
with
me
if
he
is
seen
at
the
school
i
beseech
of
you
have
a
little
mercy
on
me
for
the
sake
of
my
own
father
keep
him
do
keep
him
from
aylmer
your
distracted
daughter
maggie
howland
this
letter
was
addressed
to
martin
spelt
this
time
with
an
i
laburnum
villa
clapham
maggie
stamped
it
and
flying
downstairs
popped
it
into
the
box
which
held
the
letters
chapter
xx
the
villa
laburnum
villa
in
the
suburb
of
clapham
was
in
the
new
martin
eyes
quite
a
delightful
place
she
had
never
appreciated
her
first
husband
professor
howland
but
she
thoroughly
appreciated
and
after
her
own
fashion
was
fond
of
him
he
gave
her
comforts
she
had
lived
so
long
without
comforts
that
she
appreciated
these
good
things
of
life
to
the
full
she
had
never
really
been
much
attached
to
maggie
who
was
too
like
her
own
father
and
too
unlike
herself
to
allow
of
the
existence
of
any
sympathy
between
them
maggie
even
before
howland
met
martin
the
shepherd
bush
grocer
had
been
more
or
less
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
her
mother
laburnum
villa
was
furnished
as
james
martin
expressed
it
with
an
eye
to
comfort
there
were
solid
with
deep
seats
and
good
springs
and
these
were
covered
with
leather
there
were
thick
curtains
to
the
windows
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
room
was
of
solid
oak
there
was
a
rich
turkey
carpet
on
the
floor
and
prints
of
different
hunting
scenes
by
no
means
bad
in
their
way
hanging
on
the
walls
the
of
the
room
was
of
dull
red
and
the
paper
was
of
the
same
tone
it
was
a
small
room
and
the
furniture
was
large
and
heavy
but
it
represented
in
martin
eyes
the
very
essence
of
comfort
the
fireplace
was
modern
and
when
it
was
piled
up
with
goodly
lumps
of
coal
it
caused
a
warmth
to
pervade
the
whole
room
which
as
martin
expressed
it
was
very
stimulating
the
house
had
electric
light
which
both
and
martin
considered
distinguished
they
spent
most
of
their
time
in
the
although
martin
with
some
faint
instinct
still
left
of
her
own
life
would
have
preferred
to
use
the
in
the
evenings
but
when
she
suggested
this
said
no
no
i
can
smoke
here
and
sit
by
the
fire
and
enjoy
the
rest
which
i
have
rightly
earned
i
hate
rooms
full
of
you
can
keep
your
for
the
time
when
i
am
out
martin
knew
better
than
to
oppose
her
husband
she
recognized
her
own
weakness
and
knew
that
against
his
fiat
she
could
no
more
exercise
her
puny
strength
than
a
babbling
stream
can
disturb
a
great
rock
she
used
her
when
was
out
and
regarded
it
with
intense
satisfaction
it
is
true
that
the
colors
were
crude
for
james
martin
would
have
screamed
at
any
liberty
tints
but
the
carpet
was
good
of
its
kind
the
pictures
on
the
walls
not
too
atrocious
although
they
were
in
gilt
frames
the
large
mirrors
over
the
mantelpiece
and
at
one
end
of
the
room
were
first
rate
in
short
the
was
fairly
presentable
and
martin
had
some
traces
of
her
old
life
still
lingering
about
her
which
gave
a
look
of
domesticity
and
even
repose
to
the
place
her
little
with
its
embroidery
was
and
pleasant
she
had
forgotten
how
to
play
but
she
always
kept
the
piano
open
suggested
buying
a
pianola
and
martin
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
we
have
all
the
comic
operas
on
it
said
nothing
of
the
classic
order
for
me
nothing
but
the
popular
tunes
plenty
of
them
no
stint
what
do
you
say
replied
that
it
would
be
charming
but
in
her
heart
she
somewhat
shuddered
and
was
glad
that
the
pianola
was
still
a
thing
to
be
purchased
tildy
had
been
turned
into
a
very
presentable
little
there
was
also
a
cook
for
martin
was
fond
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
on
the
whole
the
little
household
was
comfortable
and
martin
enjoyed
her
life
she
had
some
cards
printed
with
her
new
name
and
address
and
the
notification
that
she
was
at
home
on
the
third
fourth
and
fifth
of
each
month
tildy
was
very
much
excited
about
these
at
home
days
but
the
first
month
after
marriage
passed
without
a
single
individual
calling
upon
her
martin
had
been
settled
for
over
six
weeks
and
the
day
of
queen
maggie
great
reception
at
the
school
in
kensington
was
drawing
on
apace
martin
was
in
a
state
of
subdued
excitement
she
was
dressed
in
her
best
her
best
consisted
of
a
light
silk
with
velvet
trimmings
of
the
same
the
silk
rustled
as
she
walked
on
her
fingers
were
many
rings
of
much
brilliancy
and
she
wore
a
small
diamond
brooch
at
her
throat
the
reason
of
all
this
festive
attire
was
a
simple
one
a
good
one
a
domestic
one
james
martin
was
coming
home
he
had
been
in
liverpool
engaged
on
special
business
for
the
greater
part
of
a
week
but
he
was
now
returning
to
his
beloved
who
had
missed
him
and
he
was
pleased
to
feel
that
he
would
be
with
her
again
she
knew
his
tastes
to
a
nicety
and
had
desired
the
cook
to
prepare
a
very
special
dinner
for
his
delectation
pudding
cook
she
said
with
mutton
kidneys
and
plenty
of
oysters
and
be
sure
the
crust
is
very
light
cook
replied
that
if
she
did
not
know
how
to
make
pudding
she
ought
immediately
to
leave
her
perfession
she
was
a
stout
woman
and
had
a
way
of
frightening
martin
who
generally
retreated
from
the
kitchen
premises
as
quickly
as
possible
very
well
said
martin
i
am
glad
you
quite
understand
you
know
that
my
husband
is
very
particular
then
we
have
potatoes
and
fried
mushrooms
and
i
think
afterwards
and
cream
the
cook
whose
name
was
horniman
condescended
to
signify
her
willingness
to
provide
this
dinner
and
martin
went
up
to
the
you
had
better
light
a
fire
here
matilda
she
said
it
going
to
be
a
very
cold
day

like
as
though

lump
o
ice

and

martin
with
dignity

very
good
idea
said
martin

little
note

to
her

very
thoughtful
of

longin
i

to
lay
eyes
on

she
a
way
with
said
matilda
when
she
was
quite
alone
martin
took
that
letter
of
maggie
which
she
had
received
during
her
husband
absence
from
her
pocket
she
was
terrified
lest
should
read
it
the
letter
had
offended
her
maggie
had
written
with
great
fire
and
distress
you
must
not
let
him
come
here
all
will
be
up
with
me
if
he
is
seen
at
the
school
for
the
sake
of
my
own
father
keep
him
from
aylmer
house
martin
slipped
it
back
into
her
pocket
and
then
sat
by
her
comfortable
fire
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
good
he
was
a
very
playful
creature
his
one
idea
of
happiness
consisted
in
endless
jokes
practical
jokes
or
otherwise
just
as
it
suited
him
at
the
moment
he
had
done
a
very
successful
stroke
of
business
in
liverpool
and
was
returning
to
laburnum
villa
in
the
highest
spirits
while
he
was
in
the
train
he
was
planning
how
he
could
most
effectively
announce
his
return
to
ring
at
his
own
or
to
open
it
with
a
or
to
walk
in
in
the
ordinary
fashion
of
the
master
of
the
house
did
not
content
him
at
all
he
must
invent
a
more
novel
manner
of
return
than
that
he
was
really
fond
of
she
suited
him
to
perfection
what
he
called
her
airs
when
they
were
displayed
to
any
one
but
himself
pleased
him
mightily
he
thought
of
her
as
pretty
and
gracious
and
sweet
he
really
loved
her
after
his
own
fashion
and
would
do
anything
in
his
power
to
make
her
happy
but
he
must
as
he
expressed
it
have
his
joke
martin
was
seated
by
the
fire
in
the
it
was
getting
late
nearly
four
but
according
to
an
expressed
wish
of
the
had
not
yet
been
drawn
down
he
liked
as
he
said
to
see
his
home
before
he
entered
it
martin
therefore
with
the
electric
light
on
was
perfectly
visible
from
the
road
martin
guessed
that
this
would
be
the
case
and
he
stopped
the
cab
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
paid
the
fare
shouldered
his
bag
and
walked
softly
down
the
street
he
went
and
stood
outside
the
window
he
looked
in
the
street
was
a
quiet
one
and
at
that
moment
there
were
no
martin
was
seated
in
her
smart
dress
which
he
had
given
her
with
her
profile
towards
him
he
thought
her
very
beautiful
indeed
his
heart
swelled
with
pride
she
belonged
to
him
he
hated
fine
ladies
as
a
rule
but
a
fine
lady
who
was
his
very
own
was
a
different
matter
he
even
felt
romantic
she
was
reading
a
letter
who
could
have
been
writing
to
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
to
slip
down
the
area
steps
and
stand
close
under
the
window
he
did
so
to
the
terror
of
cook
and
tildy
cook
was
about
to
scream
burglars
but
tildy
recognized
her
master
it
his
joke
she
said
a
wonderful
man
for
jokes
do
let
on
to
martin
that
for
your
life
do
something
so
comic
in
a
minute
the
comicality
of
martin
consisted
in
the
present
instance
of
singing
in
a
harsh
baritone
the
song
of
the
troubadour
gaily
the
troubadour
touched
his
guitar
when
he
was
hastening
home
from
the
war
singing
palestine
hither
i
come
ladye
love
ladye
love
welcome
me
home
martin
gave
a
shriek
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
pop
her
letter
into
her
pocket
then
she
approached
the
window
trembling
and
blushing
uttered
a
huge
laugh
of
delight
let
himself
in
by
the
back
way
and
ran
up
the
stairs
he
said
and
clasped
his
wife
in
his
arms
during
dinner
james
martin
was
in
high
good
humor
and
it
was
not
until
dessert
was
put
on
the
table
and
he
had
helped
himself
liberally
to
port
wine
and
was
filling
his
pipe
for
his
evening
smoke
that
it
occurred
to
him
to
speak
to
his
wife
about
maggie
by
the
way
he
said
i
did
a
right
good
turn
for
that
girl
of
yours
before
i
left
for
liverpool
i
sent
her
a
box
of
clothes
two
smart
everyday
dresses
an
evening
dress
and
no
end
of
she
wrote
to
thank
me
i
suppose
she
wrote
to
me
dear
said
martin
trembling
a
good
deal
she
was
very
much
obliged
to
you
and
well
she
ought
to
be
did
she
clearly
understand
that
i
sent
her
the
things
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
oh
yes
yes
said
martin
wo
you
have
some
coffee
james
i
tell
matilda
to
bring
it
in
coffee
fiddlestick
said
martin
and
you
know
i
hate
to
be
called
where
you
are
said
his
wife
with
a
funny
smile
well
then
no
of
me
i
think
it
is
very
queer
of
your
daughter
not
to
reply
to
me
when
i
send
her
expensive
and
handsome
things
what
did
she
say
in
her
letter
to
you
oh
she
was
very
grateful
of
course
well
but
where
the
letter
i
may
as
well
see
it
there
stuff
in
that
girl
i
do
despair
of
her
yet
she
has
a
head
for
business
i
would
have
your
dear
little
head
muddled
with
business
but
your
daughter
a
different
person
she
has
nothing
whatever
to
live
on
except
what
i
allow
her
and
unless
she
is
to
starve
she
has
got
to
please
me
martin
might
have
said
had
she
not
been
afraid
that
maggie
was
certainly
entitled
to
her
own
father
money
but
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
had
not
much
courage
matilda
came
in
with
the
coffee
which
caused
a
slight
diversion
more
particularly
as
it
was
not
to
martin
taste
who
desired
her
to
take
it
away
again
and
request
horniman
to
send
him
something
fit
to
drink
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
matilda
he
renewed
the
subject
of
the
letter
i
saw
you
reading
something
as
i
came
along
he
said
when
i
peeped
in
at
the
window
you
had
a
letter
in
your
hand
who
has
been
writing
to
you
only
maggie
and
that
is
the
letter
you
spoke
about
yes
dear
james
i
mean
yes
the
child
is
very
grateful
she
ought
to
be
i
like
to
see
the
letter
where
is
it
i
will
go
upstairs
and
fetch
it
said
martin
who
knew
well
that
it
was
safe
in
her
pocket
all
the
time
james
martin
roused
himself
and
gave
her
a
studied
look
do
so
he
said
bring
it
back
to
me
at
once
if
i
have
to
support
that
girl
and
keep
her
at
school
and
pay
for
her
clothing
allow
her
to
have
no
secrets
from
me
you
understand
that
do
you
yes
i
will
fetch
the
letter
said
martin
she
left
the
room
martin
was
fond
of
her
but
he
was
no
fool
he
was
certain
now
that
there
was
something
in
the
letter
which
his
wife
did
not
wish
him
to
see
and
his
curiosity
was
instantly
aroused
he
was
determined
to
read
poor
maggie
letter
at
any
cost
he
waited
impatiently
drumming
his
large
fat
hand
on
the
highly
polished
oak
table
the
while
tildy
came
in
with
fresh
coffee
please
sir
she
said
cook
wants
to
see
you
for
a
minute
i
ca
see
her
now
tell
her
so
replied
martin
which
is
no
message
for
a
woman
of
my
class
said
horniman
entering
the
room
and
showing
a
very
heated
face
i
wishes
to
give
notice
that
i
leave
your
service
this
day
month
you
can
go
said
martin
as
you
please
sir
wages
in
full
you
go
said
martin
and
if
you
say
another
word
you
go
leave
the
room
tildy
breathed
a
little
quickly
felt
inclined
to
pat
master
on
the
back
thought
better
of
it
and
left
the
room
whatever
is
keeping
thought
martin
to
himself
he
was
not
going
to
worry
about
cook
and
her
whims
but
of
and
the
letter
he
grew
a
little
more
suspicious
and
consequently
a
little
more
angry
she
has
that
letter
in
her
pocket
i
saw
her
put
it
there
when
i
was
acting
the
part
of
the
troubadour
he
said
to
himself
she
is
destroying
it
now
but
she
not
before
i
get
it
he
softly
left
the
and
crept
with
catlike
steps
upstairs
he
stopped
outside
his
wife
bedroom
there
was
a
light
burning
there
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
it
was
locked
open
the
door
at
once
he
said
and
martin
flew
to
do
so
oh
you
gave
me
a
fright
where
is
that
letter
victoria
it
it
i
ca
find
it
she
replied
what
are
those
papers
lying
on
the
floor
martin
gave
a
cry
martin
was
too
quick
for
her
he
swept
up
the
pieces
of
torn
letter
collected
them
in
his
great
hand
and
taking
martin
with
the
other
hand
returned
with
her
to
the
now
you
sit
there
he
said
while
i
piece
the
letter
together
there
is
something
in
it
that
you
want
hidden
from
me
but
you
quite
mistook
your
man
there
are
to
be
no
secrets
between
you
and
me
i
not
the
least
bit
angry
with
you
but
i
am
not
going
to
have
that
girl
ruling
you
you
frightened
of
that
girl
now
see
what
she
has
to
say
poor
martin
trembled
from
head
to
foot
suddenly
she
went
on
her
knees
clasped
her
hands
round
arm
and
looked
into
his
face
she
was
naughty
she
was
a
silly
child
oh
forgive
her
i
ought
to
have
destroyed
the
letter
i
ought
not
to
have
kept
it
until
you
came
back
please
please
do
read
it
nonsense
he
replied
restored
once
more
to
the
height
of
good
humor
you
have
roused
my
curiosity
nothing
will
induce
me
not
to
see
every
word
of
the
letter
now
it
took
martin
some
time
to
piece
together
poor
maggie
letter
but
at
last
the
greater
part
of
its
meaning
was
made
plain
to
him
martin
sat
white
as
death
looking
at
her
lord
and
master
what
was
going
to
happen
what
awful
thing
lay
ahead
of
her
she
felt
crushed
beyond
words
once
again
she
struggled
to
get
on
her
knees
to
implore
him
to
entreat
but
martin
put
out
his
great
hand
and
kept
her
forcibly
in
her
seat
when
he
had
quite
taken
in
the
meaning
of
the
letter
he
made
no
comment
whatever
but
carefully
deposited
the
torn
fragments
in
his
then
he
said
quietly
i
do
blame
you
not
one
bit
but
we
got
to
punish
this
girl
i
shall
be
busy
in
town
the
day
after

i
shall
be
busy
then
but

margaret
howland

aylmer
house

grocer
and
his
wife
together
not
a
word
my
love
not
a
word
chapter
xxi
tildy
message
nothing
ever
kept
martin
awake
and
notwithstanding
her
anxiety
with
regard
to
maggie
she
slept
soundly
that
night
was
his
own
delightful
self
his
jokes
were
really
too
good
for
anything
she
regarded
him
as
the
wittiest
man
of
her
acquaintance
she
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
he
told
her
that
he
would
take
her
to
the
theater
on
the
following
evening
and
further
said
that
he
would
engage
a
cook
himself
in
town
send
her
out
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
that
horniman
could
go
horniman
came
up
to
interview
her
mistress
soon
after
departure
she
was
penitent
now
and
willing
to
stay
but
nothing
would
induce
martin
himself
to
forgive
her
and
in
consequence
martin
did
not
dare
to
do
so
the
woman
was
paid
her
wages
in
full
and
dismissed
then
it
occurred
to
martin
that
here
was
her
opportunity
to
send
a
short
note
of
warning
to
maggie
why
she
did
not
send
it
by
post
it
is
hard
to
ascertain
but
she
thought
that
it
would
go
more
swiftly
and
surely
if
tildy
were
the
messenger
accordingly
she
sent
for
tildy
and
told
her
what
she
expected
her
to
do
matilda
she
said
cook
has
gone
and
i
shall
be
quite
content
with
tea
and
toast
and
a
lightly
boiled
egg
for
my
lunch
after
lunch
you
can
take
the
train
to
london
and
convey
a
message
from
me
to
miss
maggie
oh

tildy
i

if
possible

and

by

time

tildy

bushy
and

sight
better

did
well

now
and
attend
to
your
business
said
martin
having
secured
a
messenger
martin
next
prepared
to
write
to
poor
maggie
my
dear
child
most
unfortunately
your
father
has
discovered
the
letter
you
wrote
to
me
he
does
say
much
but
i
can
see
that
he
is
furiously
angry
he
intends
to
take
me
with
him
to
call
on
you
next
saturday
i
presume
some
time
in
the
afternoon
i
will
try
to
make
him
dress
in
as
gentlemanly
a
manner
as
possible
and
also
will
endeavor
to
prevent
his
talking
about
the
shop
you
must
make
the
very
best
of
things
you
can
dear
for
there
no
possible
way
of
keeping
him
from
aylmer
your
affectionate
mother
victoria
martin
when
the
letter
was
finished
martin
put
it
into
an
envelope
addressed
to
miss
maggie
howland
aylmer
house
randal
square
south
kensington
and
put
it
into
tildy
care
tildy
caught
her
train
all
in
good
time
arrived
at
victoria
and
took
a
bus
to
south
kensington
a
very
little
inquiry
enabled
her
to
find
randal
square
and
at
about
two
she
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
that
most
refined
and
genteel
home
aylmer
house
the
look
of
the
place
impressed
her
but
did
not
give
her
any
sense
of
intimidation
when
the
door
was
opened
to
her
modest
ring
and
the
pleasant
answered
her
summons
tildy
gazed
at
her
with
great
interest
but
without
a
scrap
of
shyness
i
come
from
to
see
miss
maggie
said
tildy
and
i
a
message
for
from
ma
the
girl
whose
name
was
agnes
stared
for
a
minute
at
tildy
she
recognized
her
sort
in
a
moment
tildy
belonged
to
the
sort
of
girl
what
she
could
have
to
do
with
one
of
agnes
young
ladies
puzzled
that
young
person
considerably
it
was
the
rule
however
at
aylmer
house
that
no
one
however
poor
or
humble
should
be
treated
with
rudeness
and
certainly
a
person
bringing
a
message
to
one
of
the
young
ladies
was
entitled
to
respect
agnes
said
therefore
in
a
polite
and
superior
tone
step
in
will
you
miss
and
i
will
find
out
if
miss
howland
is
in
tildy
stepped
into
the
hall
feeling
as
she
expressed
it
and
queer
all
over
she
did
not
dare
to
sit
down
but
stood
on
the
mat
gazing
with
her
bright
inquisitive
eyes
at
the
various
things
in
this
new
world
in
which
she
found
herself
how
beauteous
she
kept
repeating
at
intervals
why
laburnum
villa
ai
a
patch
on
this
how
very
beauteous
no
wonder
miss
maggie
the
hair
of
a
queen
now
it
so
happened
that
maggie
howland
was
out
and
would
not
be
back
for
some
time
this
was
the
day
when
she
and
the
other
girls
belonging
to
her
kingdom
had
gone
forth
to
purchase
all
sorts
of
good
things
for
the
coming
feast
maggie
as
queen
had
put
a
whole
sovereign
into
the
bag
there
would
therefore
be
no
stint
of
provisions
every
sort
of
eatable
that
was
not
usually
permitted
at
aylmer
house
was
to
grace
the
board
jelly
meringues
frosted
cake
tipsy
cake
as
well
as
chickens
garnished
in
the
most
exquisite
way
and
prepared
specially
by
a
confectioner
round
the
corner
also
different
dainties
in
aspic
jellies
were
to
be
ordered
then
flowers
were
to
be
secured
in
advance
so
as
to
make
the
table
really
very
beautiful
maggie
kathleen
and
janet
were
the
people
selected
to
arrange
about
the
supper
not
a
single
thing
was
to
be
cooked
in
the
establishment
this
would
give
extra
trouble
to
the
servants
and
was
therefore
not
to
be
permitted
the
girls
would
make
their
own
sandwiches
and
oh
what
troublesome
thoughts
they
had
over
these
maggie
was
in
the
highest
spirits
and
left
the
house
with
her
companions
miss
johnson
of
course
in
close
attendance
before
tildy
with
her
ominous
letter
appeared
on
the
scene
now
it
so
happened
that
agnes
knew
nothing
at
all
of
the
absence
of
the
young
ladies
they
usually
went
out
by
a
which
had
been
specially
assigned
to
their
use
when
the
house
was
turned
into
a
school
as
agnes
was
going
upstairs
however
in
order
to
try
to
find
maggie
she
met
aneta
coming
down
oh
miss
she
said
can
you
tell
me
if
miss
howland
is
in
no
said
aneta
i
happen
to
know
that
she
is
out
and
i
do
think
she
will
be
in
for
some
little
time
very
well
miss
the
young
person
will
be
sorry
i
expect
what
young
person
asked
aneta
eager
in
her
turn
to
find
out
why
maggie
was
inquired
for
a
girl
miss
who
has
called
and
has
asked
very
particularly
to
see
miss
howland
she
rather
a
common
sort
of
girl
miss
although
i
dare
say
she
means
well
i
will
go
and
see
her
myself
said
aneta
perhaps
i
can
convey
a
message
from
her
to
miss
howland
for
i
know
she
wo
be
back
for
some
little
time
agnes
quite
relieved
in
her
mind
turned
down
the
and
went
to
attend
to
her
numerous
duties
a
few
minutes
after
aneta
in
all
her
slim
grace
stood
in
the
hall
and
confronted
tildy
aneta
was
herself
going
out
she
was
going
out
with
mademoiselle
laplage
they
had
some
commissions
to
execute
the
day
was
a
foggy
one
and
they
were
both
rather
in
a
hurry
nevertheless
aneta
stopped
to
say
a
kind
word
to
tildy
tildy
gazed
at
her
with
admiration
beautiful
as
the
house
was
this
young
lady
was
indeed
a
radiant
and
dazzling
vision
she
made
me
sort
o
choky
said
tildy
as
she
related
the
circumstance
afterwards
to
martin
there
was
a
hair
about
her
well
much
as
i
loves
our
miss
maggie
she
ai
got
the
hair
o
that
beauteous
young
lady
with
eyes
as
blue
as
the
sky
and
walk
so
very
distinguishified
what
can
i
do
for
you
said
aneta
now
in
a
kind
tone
tildy
dropped
an
awkward
curtsy
i
come
miss
she
said
to
see
our
miss
maggie
miss
howland
is
out
said
aneta
oh
miss
replied
tildy
the
corners
of
her
mouth
beginning
to
droop
that
crool
on
me
do
you
think
miss
if
i
may
make
so
bold
as
to
inquire
that
miss
maggie
be
in
soon
i
do
not
think
so
replied
aneta
but
i
can
convey
any
message
you
like
to
her
if
you
will
trust
me
oh
miss
said
tildy
worshipping
aneta
on
the
spot
who
trust
one
like
you
well
what
is
it
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
was
maid
miss
at
shepherd
bush
when
miss
maggie
and
ma
used
to
live
there
and
when
married
martin
the
grocer
they
was
that
kind
they
took
me
to
live
at
laburnum
villa
it
a
very
rich
and
comfortable
miss
and
the
way
they
two
goes
on
is
most
excitin
it
joke
joke
and
play
play
from
morn
till
night
that
the
ma
and
steppa
of
miss
maggie
i
brought
a
letter
from
martin
to
be
delivered
straight
to
miss
maggie
i
can
give
it
to
her
said
aneta
in
her
calm
voice
you
mention
miss
said
tildy
taking
the
letter
from
her
pocket
as
i
called
and
as
i
love
our
dear
miss
maggie
as
much
as
i
ever
did
you
say
miss
with
my
dutiful
respects
that
my
is
and
always
will
be
i
will
give
her
a
kind
message
said
aneta
and
safely
deliver
her
mother
letter
to
her
i
am
afraid
there
no
use
in
asking
you
to
stay
as
miss
howland
is
very
much
occupied
just
now
very
well
miss
i
delivered
my
message
faithful
you
have
as
aneta
spoke
she
herself
opened
the
miss
said
tildy
dropping
another
curtsy
and
i
wishes
you
well
replied
aneta
tildy
little
form
was
swallowed
up
in
the
fog
which
was
growing
thicker
each
moment
and
at
that
instant
mademoiselle
laplage
profuse
in
apologies
for
her
brief
delay
entered
the
hall
pardon
me
that
i
have
caused
you
to
wait
i
was
just
ready
to
descend
when
see
the
lace
of
my
shoe
was
broken
but
what
will
you
you
will
go
out
in
this
dreadful
fog
aneta
replied
in
french
that
she
did
not
think
the
fog
was
too
thick
and
the
french
governess
and
the
girl
went
out
together
into
the
street
but
all
the
time
aneta
lysle
was
thinking
hard
she
was
in
possession
of
maggie
secret
her
stepfather
instead
of
being
related
to
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
was
a
grocer
aneta
belonged
to
that
class
of
persons
who
think
a
great
deal
of
good
birth
she
did
not
mind
tildy
in
the
least
for
tildy
was
so
far
below
her
as
to
be
after
a
fashion
quite
companionable
but
a
grocer
nevertheless
aneta
had
a
heart
she
thought
of
maggie
and
the
more
she
thought
of
her
the
more
pitiful
she
felt
towards
her
she
did
not
want
to
crush
or
humiliate
her
schoolfellow
she
felt
almost
glad
that
the
secret
of
maggie
unhappiness
had
been
made
known
to
her
she
might
at
last
gain
a
true
influence
over
the
girl
her
walk
therefore
with
mademoiselle
laplage
took
place
almost
in
silence
they
hastily
executed
their
commissions
and
presently
found
themselves
in
pearce
shop
where
aneta
had
taken
a
brooch
a
day
or
two
ago
to
have
a
pin
put
on
the
shopman
as
he
handed
her
the
mended
brooch
said
at
the
same
time
if
you
will
excuse
me
miss
you
are
one
of
the
young
ladies
who
live
at
aylmer
house
yes
said
aneta
that
is
true
then
i
wonder
miss
if
he
paused
a
minute
looked
hard
at
the
girl
and
then
continued
might
my
brother
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
miss
but
it
make
so
cold
said
mademoiselle
who
knew
very
little
of
the
english
tongue
and
behold
zee
fog
i
have
such
fear
of
it
it
is
not
to
joke
when
it
fogs
in
your
country
chère
il
faute
bien
i
shall
be
quite
ready
to
come
back
with
you
in
a
minute
or
two
said
aneta
just
then
the
man
who
had
bought
the
brooch
from
maggie
appeared
i
am
very
sorry
miss
he
said
but
i
thought
that
instead
of
writing
to
miss
howland
i
might
send
her
a
message
otherwise
i
should
have
to
see
ward
on
the
matter
but
what
matter
is
it
said
aneta
you
want
to
see
miss
howland
or
you
want
me
to
take
her
a
message
well
miss
it
no
special
secret
only
my
brother
and
i
can
not
afford
to
buy
the
brooch
which
she
sold
us
the
other
day
but
i
do
understand
said
aneta
miss
howland
sold
you
a
brooch
then
if
she
sold
it
you
did
buy
it
the
fact
is
miss
said
young
pearce
coloring
rather
deeply
i
was
not
myself
quite
aware
of
its
value
at
the
time
and
i
gave
the
young
lady
much
too
small
a
sum
of
money
for
it
i
want
her
to
return
me
the
money
and
i
will
give
her
back
the
brooch
my
brother
and
i
have
been
talking
it
over
and
we
can
not
do
an
injustice
to
one
of
the
ladies
at
aylmer
house
it
is
quite
impossible
i
will
give
your
message
said
aneta
coldly
please
do
not
purchase
anything
else
from
miss
howland
she
will
doubtless
call
to
see
you
thank
you
miss
then
that
is
all
right
said
the
man
looking
much
relieved
aneta
hastened
home
she
felt
perplexed
and
alarmed
she
must
see
maggie
and
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
a
strange
fact
that
while
maggie
was
in
no
danger
at
all
while
everything
seemed
to
be
going
right
with
her
and
as
long
as
she
held
an
undeniable
position
in
the
school
as
one
of
the
queens
aneta
could
scarcely
endure
her
that
now
that
maggie
howland
was
so
to
speak
at
her
mercy
this
girl
whose
nature
was
fine
and
brave
and
good
felt
a
strong
desire
to
help
her
there
were
however
very
strict
rules
at
aylmer
house
and
one
of
them
was
that
no
girl
on
any
account
whatsoever
was
to
sell
any
of
her
possessions
in
order
to
make
money
this
was
one
of
the
unwritten
rules
of
the
school
but
the
idea
of
an
aylmer
house
girl
really
requiring
to
do
such
a
thing
was
never
contemplated
for
an
instant
there
were
broad
lines
of
conduct
however
which
no
girl
was
expected
to
pass
liberty
was
allowed
to
a
great
extent
at
aylmer
house
but
it
was
a
liberty
which
only
those
who
struggle
to
walk
in
the
right
path
can
fully
enjoy
crooked
ways
underhand
dealings
could
not
be
permitted
in
the
school
maggie
had
done
quite
enough
to
cause
her
to
be
expelled
there
had
been
times
when
aneta
almost
wished
for
this
when
she
had
felt
deep
down
in
her
heart
that
maggie
howland
was
the
one
adverse
influence
in
the
school
when
she
had
been
certain
that
if
maggie
howland
were
removed
all
the
other
girls
would
come
more
or
less
under
her
own
gentle
sway
and
she
would
be
queen
not
of
the
greater
number
of
the
girls
at
aylmer
house
but
of
all
the
girls
and
very
gentle
very
loving
very
sympathetic
would
be
her
rule
her
subjects
should
feel
her
sympathy
but
at
the
same
time
they
should
acknowledge
her
power
maggie
was
a
and
now
there
was
a
chance
of
putting
a
stop
to
it
aneta
knew
well
that
kind
as
ward
was
to
maggie
she
did
not
in
her
heart
absolutely
trust
her
therefore
if
maggie
left
it
would
also
be
a
relief
to
ward
miss
johnson
might
be
sorry
and
one
or
two
of
the
girls
might
be
sorry
in
particular
dear
little
merry
aneta
had
a
great
love
for
merry
and
was
deeply
sorry
to
feel
that
merry
was
under
maggie
spell
that
was
the
case
although
she
did
not
openly
belong
to
maggie
party
so
merry
too
would
be
saved
if
maggie
left
the
school
oh
it
was
most
desirable
and
aneta
held
the
key
of
the
position
in
her
hand
she
also
had
in
her
pocket
martin
letter
that
did
not
perhaps
so
greatly
matter
for
father
whatever
her
mother
had
done
was
himself
a
gentleman
but
the
fact
of
maggie
slipping
out
of
doors
alone
to
sell
an
ornament
was
a
sufficiently
grave
offense
to
banish
her
from
such
a
school
as
aylmer
house
yes
aneta
could
send
her
away
but
it
might
be
managed
dexterously
maggie
might
stay
till
the
end
of
the
present
term
and
then
go
knowing
herself
that
she
would
never
return
whereas
the
girls
would
know
nothing
about
it
until
the
beginning
of
the
next
term
when
they
would
no
longer
see
her
familiar
face
or
hear
her
pleasant
voice
a
few
of
them
might
be
sorry
but
they
would
quickly
forget
the
school
would
be
the
better
for
her
absence
the
thing
could
be
done
and
it
would
be
done
if
aneta
used
that
knowledge
which
she
now
possessed
the
girls
all
met
at
tea
and
maggie
was
in
the
highest
spirits
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
all
the
information
which
aneta
had
gathered
in
her
absence
she
knew
nothing
of
tildy
arrival
of
departure
nor
of
the
letter
which
aneta
had
put
into
one
of
her
drawers
still
less
did
she
know
anything
of
pearce
and
his
betrayal
of
her
she
and
her
companions
had
had
a
very
pleasant
time
and
immediately
after
tea
in
the
leisure
hours
they
were
to
meet
in
the
girl
private
to
discuss
matters
officially
the
aneta
girls
had
by
common
consent
given
up
the
room
to
them
during
these
last
important
days
there
were
plenty
of
nooks
and
corners
all
over
the
cheerful
house
where
they
could
amuse
themselves
and
talk
secrets
and
have
that
sort
of
confidence
which
schoolgirls
delight
in
as
soon
as
tea
was
over
maggie
jumped
up
and
said
now
kitty
she
turned
to
kathleen
as
she
spoke
you
and
i
and
rosamond
and
jane
and
matty
and
clara
and
the
tristrams
will
get
through
our
work
as
quickly
as
i
suppose
girls
here
she
glanced
at
aneta
in
particular
you
will
let
us
have
the
as
usual
during
the
leisure
hours
of
course
we
will
said
sylvia
john
in
her
gentle
tone
but
she
had
scarcely
uttered
the
words
before
aneta
rose
of
course
you
can
have
the
she
said
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
maggie
you
ca
i
am
afraid
just
now
said
maggie
i
am
much
too
we
have
to
go
into
accounts
girls
she
added
there
are
no
end
of
things
to
be
done
besides
at
the
rehearsal
here
she
dropped
her
voice
slightly
the
rest
of
you
can
go
to
the
and
do
what
is
necessary
continued
aneta
i
want
you
maggie
and
you
had
better
come
with
me
she
spoke
very
firmly
a
dogged
look
came
into
maggie
face
she
threw
back
her
head
and
glanced
full
at
aneta
i
go
with
you
she
said
just
because
you
ask
me
forsooth
you
forget
yourself
queen
aneta
i
also
am
a
queen
and
have
a
kingdom
my
business
with
you
has
something
to
do
with
a
person
who
calls
herself
tildy
said
aneta
in
her
gravest
voice
and
maggie
suddenly
felt
as
though
a
cold
douche
had
been
thrown
over
her
she
colored
a
vivid
red
then
she
turned
eagerly
to
kathleen
i
wo
be
a
minute
she
said
you
all
go
into
the
and
get
the
accounts
in
order
you
might
also
go
over
that
tableaux
with
diana
kathleen
you
know
that
you
must
put
a
little
more
life
into
your
face
than
you
did
the
other
day
and
and
oh
dear
how
annoying
this
is
yes
of
course
i
will
go
with
you
aneta
you
keep
me
a
minute
maggie
and
aneta
left
the
room
merry
turned
to
her
sister
and
said
in
a
troubled
voice
i
imagine
why
it
is
that
aneta
does
care
for
poor
maggie
i
love
aneta
of
course
for
she
is
our
very
own
cousin
but
i
can
not
understand
her
want
of
sympathy
for
dearest
maggie
i
am
not
altogether
quite
so
fond
of
maggie
as
you
are
merry
and
you
know
that
said
cicely
i
know
it
said
merry
you
are
altogether
taken
up
with
aneta
oh
and
with
school
generally
said
cicely
it
is
all
so
splendid
but
come
we
are
alone
in
the
room
and
losing
some
of
our
delightful
leisure
hours
the
had
meanwhile
retired
into
the
where
they
stood
together
in
groups
talking
about
the
excitement
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
following
saturday
it
was
now
thursday
and
paying
very
little
heed
to
maggie
injunctions
to
put
the
accounts
in
order
do
bother
about
accounts
said
kitty
there
heaps
of
money
left
in
the
bag
was
it
scrumptious
of
old
mags
to
put
a
whole
sovereign
in
and
i
know
she
is
not
rich
the
dear
old
precious
she
is
exactly
the
sort
of
girl
who
would
do
a
generous
thing
said
clara
roache
and
of
course
as
queen
she
felt
that
she
must
put
a
little
more
money
into
the
bag
than
the
rest
of
us
well
she
need
said
kathleen
i
have
loved
her
just
as
much
if
she
had
put
a
penny
in
she
is
a
duck
though
i
ca
think
why
i
care
so
much
about
her
for
she
not
beautiful
strictly
speaking
she
is
plain
said
janet
burns
but
in
a
case
like
maggie
plain
face
does
matter
in
the
least
she
has
got
something
inside
said
matty
which
makes
up
for
her
plain
features
it
her
soul
shining
out
of
her
eyes
yes
of
course
said
kathleen
and
it
fills
her
voice
too
she
has
got
power
and
what
you
call
charm
she
is
meant
to
rule
people
i
admire
her
myself
more
than
aneta
lysle
said
janet
burns
although
of
course
all
the
world
would
call
aneta
beautiful
yes
that
is
quite
true
said
kathleen
but
i
call
aneta
a
little
stiff
and
she
is
very
determined
too
and
she
does
like
poor
old
mags
one
single
bit
was
it
jolly
of
mags
to
get
up
this
glorious
day
for
us
wo
we
have
fun
aneta
may
look
to
her
laurels
for
my
opinion
that
the
gibsons
and
the
cardews
will
both
come
over
to
our
side
after
saturday
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
and
maggie
absence
was
deplored
and
no
business
whatever
was
being
done
towards
the
entertainment
of
saturday
maggie
found
herself
seated
opposite
to
aneta
in
aneta
own
bedroom
maggie
felt
queer
and
shaken
she
did
not
quite
know
what
was
the
matter
aneta
face
was
very
quiet
after
a
time
she
drew
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
put
it
into
maggie
hand
who
brought
this
asked
maggie
a
person
who
called
herself
tildy
maggie
held
the
letter
unopened
in
her
lap
why
do
you
read
it
said
aneta
maggie
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
the
handwriting
then
she
put
it
down
again
it
from
my
mother
she
said
it
can
keep
i
can
not
imagine
said
aneta
anybody
waiting
even
for
one
moment
to
read
a
letter
which
one
own
mother
has
written
my
mother
is
dead
you
know
she
spoke
in
a
low
tone
and
her
pretty
eyelashes
rested
on
her
softly
rounded
cheeks
maggie
looked
at
her
why
did
you
bring
me
up
here
aneta
away
from
all
the
others
away
from
our
important
business
to
give
me
this
letter
i
thought
you
would
rather
have
it
in
private
said
aneta
you
thought
more
than
that
aneta
yes
i
thought
more
than
that
said
aneta
in
her
gentlest
tone
maggie
queer
narrow
eyes
flashed
fire
suddenly
she
stood
up
you
have
something
to
say
say
it
and
be
quick
for
i
must
go
i
do
think
you
must
go
just
yet
maggie
for
what
i
have
to
say
can
not
be
said
in
a
minute
you
will
have
to
give
up
your
leisure
hours
i
can
not
our
entertainment
is
on
saturday
the
entertainment
must
wait
said
aneta
it
is
of
no
consequence
compared
to
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
oh
have
it
out
said
maggie
you
were
always
spying
and
prying
on
me
you
always
hated
me
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
to
you
have
left
you
alone
if
you
had
left
me
alone
but
you
have
interfered
with
me
and
made
my
life
miserable
god
knows
i
am
not
too
happy
maggie
struggled
with
her
emotion
but
you
have
made
things
twice
as
bad
do
you
really
really
think
that
maggie
please
do
say
any
more
then
until
you
hear
me
out
to
the
end
i
will
tell
you
as
quickly
as
possible
i
will
put
you
out
of
suspense
i
could
have
made
things
very
different
for
you
but
at
least
i
will
put
you
out
of
suspense
well
go
on
i
am
willing
to
listen
i
hope
you
will
be
brief
it
is
this
maggie
i
will
say
nothing
about
your
past
i
simply
tell
you
what
through
no
fault
of
mine
i
found
out
you
gave
the
girls
of
this
school
to
understand
that
your
mother
husband
your
stepfather
was
a
gentleman
of
old
family
the
person
called
tildy
told
me
about
martin
he
may
be
a
gentleman
by
nature
but
he
is
not
one
by
profession
maggie
clutched
one
of
her
hands
so
tightly
that
the
nails
almost
pierced
her
flesh
i
wo
hurt
you
maggie
by
saying
much
on
that
subject
your
own
father
was
a
gentleman
and
you
can
not
help
your
mother
having
married
beneath
her
maggie
gasped
such
words
as
these
from
the
proud
aneta
but
there
is
worse
to
follow
continued
aneta
i
happened
to
go
to
pearce
maggie
who
had
sank
back
again
in
her
seat
and
pearce
wants
to
see
you
in
order
to
return
a
brooch
which
you
sold
him
he
says
that
he
can
not
afford
the
right
price
for
the
brooch
he
wants
you
to
give
him
back
the
money
which
he
lent
you
on
it
and
he
wants
you
to
have
the
brooch
again
in
your
possession
you
of
course
know
maggie
that
in
selling
one
of
your
belongings
and
in
going
out
without
leave
you
broke
one
of
the
fundamental
rules
of
aylmer
house
you
know
that
therefore
why
what
is
the
matter
maggie
queer
face
was
working
convulsively
after
a
time
slow
big
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
her
complexion
changed
from
its
usual
dull
ugliness
to
a
vivid
red
it
then
went
white
so
ghastly
white
that
the
girl
might
have
been
going
to
faint
all
this
took
place
in
less
than
a
minute
at
the
end
of
that
time
maggie
was
her
old
disdainful
angry
self
once
more
you
must
be
very
glad
she
said
you
have
me
in
your
power
at
last
my
stepfather
is
a
grocer
he
keeps
a
shop
at
shepherd
bush
he
is
one
of
the
most
horribly
vulgar
men
that
ever
lived
had
i
been
at
home
my
mother
would
not
have
consented
to
marry
him
but
my
mother
although
pretty
and
and
in
herself
a
lady
has
little
force
of
character
and
she
was
quite
alone
and
very
poor
indeed
you
who
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
can
not
conceive
what
it
meant
to
her
little
merry
guessed
dear
dear
little
merry
but
as
to
you
you
think
when
you
subscribe
to
this
charity
and
the
other
you
think
when
you
adopt
an
east
end
child
and
write
letters
to
her
and
give
of
your
superabundance
to
benefit
her
that
you
understand
the
poor
i
tell
you
you
your
wealth
is
a
curse
to
you
not
a
blessing
you
no
more
understand
what
people
like
mother
and
like
myself
have
lived
through
than
you
understand
what
the
inhabitants
of
mars
do
the
petty
shifts
the
smallnesses
the
queer
efforts
to
make
two
ends
meet
you
in
your
lovely
home
and
surrounded
by
lovely
things
and
your
aunt
so
proud
of
you
how
you
understand
what
lodgings
in
the
hot
weather
in
shepherd
bush
are
like
mother
understood
never
any
fresh
air
never
any
tempting
food
tildy
that
poor
little
faithful
girl
as
servant
slavey
was
her
right
name
tildy
at
every
one
beck
and
call
always
with
a
smut
on
her
cheek
and
her
hair
so
untidy
and
her
little
person
so
disreputable
and
mother
alone
wondering
how
she
could
make
two
ends
meet
talk
of
your
knowing
what
the
poor
people
in
my
class
go
through
i
do
pretend
that
i
do
know
maggie
said
aneta
who
was
impressed
by
the
passion
and
strength
of
maggie
words
i
pretend
it
for
a
moment
the
poverty
of
such
lives
is
to
me
a
sealed
book
but
forgive
me
if
you
are
so
poor
how
could
you
come
here
i
do
mind
your
knowing
everything
now
said
maggie
i
am
disgraced
and
nothing
will
ever
get
me
out
of
my
trouble
i
am
up
to
my
neck
and
i
may
as
well
drown
at
once
but
ward
she
understood
what
a
poor
girl
whose
father
was
a
gentleman
could
feel
and
she
oh
she
was
good
she
took
me
for
so
little
that
mother
could
afford
it
she
made
no
difference
between
you
and
me
aneta
who
are
so
rich
and
your
cousins
the
cardews
who
are
so
rich
too
she
said
howland
your
father
was
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honor
a
man
of
whom
his
country
was
proud
and
i
will
educate
you
and
give
you
your
chance
and
oh
i
was
happy
here
and
i
and
i
should
be
happy
now
but
for
you
and
your
prying
ways
you
are
unkind
to
me
maggie
the
knowledge
that
your
stepfather
was
a
grocer
was
brought
to
me
in
a
most
unexpected
way
i
was
not
to
blame
for
the
little
person
who
called
herself
tildy
coming
here
tildy
felt
no
shame
in
the
fact
that
your
mother
had
married
a
grocer
she
was
far
more
about
it
than
you
are
maggie
no
one
could
have
blamed
you
because
your
mother
chose
to
marry
beneath
her
but
you
were
to
blame
maggie
when
you
gave
us
to
understand
that
her
husband
was
in
quite
a
different
position
from
what
he
is
and
you
think
said
maggie
stamping
her
foot
that
the
girls
of
this
house
kathleen
sylvia
john
henrietta
and
mary
gibson
the
cardews
the
tristrams
you
yourself
would
put
up
with
me
for
a
single
moment
if
it
was
known
what
my
mother
has
done
i
think
you
underrate
us
all
said
aneta
then
she
came
close
to
maggie
and
took
one
of
her
hands
i
want
to
tell
you
something
she
added
maggie
had
never
before
allowed
her
hand
to
remain
for
a
second
in
aneta
grasp
but
there
was
something
at
this
moment
about
the
young
girl
a
look
in
her
eyes
which
absolutely
puzzled
maggie
and
caused
her
to
remain
mute
she
had
struggled
for
a
minute
but
now
her
hand
lay
still
in
aneta
clasp
i
want
to
help
you
said
aneta
to
help
me
how
i
thought
you
hated
me
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
aneta
i
did
not
love
you
until
until
said
maggie
her
eyes
shining
and
her
little
face
becoming
transformed
in
a
minute
until
i
knew
what
you
must
have
suffered
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
love
me
now
i
believe
said
aneta
looking
fixedly
at
maggie
that
i
could
love
you
oh
said
maggie
she
snatched
her
hand
away
and
walking
to
the
window
looked
out
the
fog
was
thicker
than
ever
and
she
could
see
nothing
but
that
did
not
matter
she
wanted
to
keep
her
back
turned
to
aneta
presently
her
shoulders
began
to
heave
and
taking
her
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
she
pressed
it
to
her
eyes
then
she
turned
round
go
on
she
said
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
aneta
say
what
you
want
to
say
i
am
the
stepdaughter
of
a
grocer
and
i
have
broken
one
of
the
strictest
rules
in
the
school
when
will
you
tell
ward
i
had
better
leave
at
once
you
need
leave
at
all
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
aneta
that
if
you
will
tell
ward
everything
all
about
your
stepfather
and
all
about
your
selling
that
jewel
and
going
out
without
leave
i
am
positively
sure
that
dear
ward
will
not
expel
you
from
the
school
i
am
also
sure
maggie
that
there
will
not
be
one
girl
at
aylmer
house
who
will
ever
reproach
you
as
to
your
stepfather
being
what
he
is
no
girl
in
her
senses
would
blame
you
for
that
you
are
the
daughter
of
professor
howland
one
of
the
greatest
explorers
of
his
time
a
man
who
has
had
a
book
written
about
him
and
has
largely
contributed
to
the
world
knowledge
do
forget
that
please
none
of
us
are
likely
to
forget
it
as
to
the
other
thing
well
there
is
always
the
road
of
confession
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
if
you
will
see
ward
she
will
be
kind
to
you
and
forgive
you
for
her
heart
is
very
big
and
her
sympathies
very
wide
and
then
afterwards
i
myself
will
for
your
sake
try
to
understand
your
position
and
i
myself
will
be
your
true
friend
oh
aneta
said
maggie
she
ran
up
to
aneta
she
took
her
hand
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
give
me
till
she
said
promise
that
you
wo
say
anything
till
aneta
promised
maggie
went
to
her
room
chapter
xxii
aneta
plan
the
girls
downstairs
wondered
why
maggie
howland
did
not
appear
after
an
hour
of
waiting
kathleen
took
the
lead
the
accounts
were
left
alone
but
the
tableaux
vivants
were
diligently
rehearsed
the
tristrams
and
jane
burns
being
the
three
critics
rosamond
dacre
kathleen
and
matty
and
clara
roache
the
performers
but
somehow
there
was
no
life
in
the
acting
for
the
moving
spirit
was
not
there
the
bright
quick
eye
was
missed
the
eager
words
were
lacking
with
the
pointed
and
telling
criticism
then
there
was
the
scene
where
maggie
herself
was
to
take
a
part
it
was
from
and
a
which
she
was
able
to
render
with
great
precision
and
even
beauty
and
the
dun
light
would
be
in
her
favor
it
was
to
be
the
crowning
one
and
the
last
of
the
tableaux
it
was
expected
to
bring
down
the
house
but
maggie
was
not
there
and
the
girls
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
disconsolate
and
a
little
surprised
at
supper
that
evening
there
were
eager
inquiries
with
regard
to
maggie
howland
all
the
girls
came
up
to
ask
aneta
where
the
other
queen
was
she
is
not
quite
well
and
has
gone
to
bed
said
aneta
she
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
until
the
morning
aneta
words
had
a
curious
effect
upon
every
one
who
heard
her
speak
it
was
as
though
she
had
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
absolutely
taken
maggie
part
her
eyes
when
she
spoke
of
maggie
were
full
of
affection
the
girls
were
puzzled
but
merry
as
they
turned
away
suddenly
ran
back
to
aneta
swept
her
arm
round
the
girl
neck
and
said
oh
neta
i
do
love
you
aneta
pressed
merry
hand
for
the
first
time
these
two
understood
each
other
meanwhile
poor
maggie
was
living
through
one
of
the
most
dreadful
periods
of
her
life
her
mother
intimation
that
she
and
her
stepfather
were
coming
without
fail
to
aylmer
house
on
saturday
day
the
glorious
day
when
maggie
and
her
friends
were
to
entertain
ward
and
the
rest
of
the
school
drove
the
girl
nearly
wild
aneta
had
discovered
her
secret
and
aneta
had
urged
as
the
one
way
out
the
painful
but
salutary
road
of
confession
maggie
writhed
at
the
thought
but
she
writhed
far
more
terribly
at
the
news
which
her
mother
letter
contained
the
girl
said
to
herself
i
can
not
stand
it
i
will
run
away
he
has
destroyed
my
last
chance
i
will
run
away
and
hide
i
will
go
there
is
no
use
in
waiting
aneta
is
kind
she
is
far
kinder
than
i
could
ever
have
given
her
credit
for
she
would
i
believe
help
me
and
dear
ward
would
help
me
i
am
sure
of
that
and
i
do
really
mind
now
that
it
comes
to
the
point
of
losing
my
position
in
the
school
as
queen
but
for
all
the
school
for
the
tristrams
for
merry
cardew
for
kathleen
to
see
that
man
is
beyond
my
power
of
endurance
he
will
call
here
and
he
will
bring
poor
mother
but
as
i
wo
be
here
i
wo
feel
anything
i
will
go
i
slip
downstairs
and
let
myself
out
i
have
some
money
thank
goodness
for
that
and
i
have
my
father
treasures
i
can
take
them
out
of
the
tin
box
and
wear
them
on
my
person
and
i
can
sell
them
one
by
one
yes
i
will
run
away
there
no
help
for
it
maggie
at
aneta
suggestion
had
got
into
bed
but
even
to
think
of
sleep
was
beyond
her
power
she
got
up
again
presently
dressed
and
sat
by
the
foggy
window
the
fog
was
worse
it
was
so
thick
now
that
you
could
not
see
your
way
even
as
far
as
the
trees
in
the
middle
of
the
square
there
were
sounding
from
time
to
time
and
cabs
going
very
slowly
and
boys
carrying
torches
to
light
belated
and
lost
passengers
maggie
was
safe
enough
in
her
room
which
had
like
all
the
other
bedrooms
at
aylmer
house
a
small
fire
burning
in
the
grate
some
one
tapped
at
the
door
maggie
said
do
come
in
but
her
words
were
unheeded
the
door
was
opened
an
inch
or
two
and
merry
cardew
entered
oh
merry
you
of
all
people
said
maggie
and
why
not
said
merry
i

your
friend
your
own
very
very
great
friend

the
matter

most
dreadful
said
maggie
but
you
will
know
on
saturday
oh
said
merry
coming
up
to
maggie
and
dropping
on
her
knees
and
fondling
one
of
the
girl
cold
hands
why

i
wait

ca

some
one

lucy
johnson

come
in
oh
do
make
matters
worse
for
me
merry
maggie
seemed
so
anxious
that
merry
should
go
that
the
girl
felt
hurt
and
rose
to
her
feet
merry
dear
said
maggie
as
merry
was
walking
towards
the
door
then
she
added
in
a
which
merry
did
not
catch
and
merry
dear
we
shall
never
meet
again
merry
left
the
room
feeling
full
of
apprehension
she
thought
for
a
minute
as
she
stood
outside
then
she
went
and
knocked
at
door
aneta
may
i
come
in
of
course
dear
what
is
the
matter
said
her
cousin
merry
entered
at
once
i
have
been
to
see
maggie
she
is
awfully
queer
oh
i
know
i
broke
the
rules
i
must
tell
miss
johnson
in
the
morning
i
did
beg
of
you
merry
not
to
go
to
her
said
aneta
yes
i
know
you
did
but
i
could
not
help
thinking
and
thinking
about
her
she
is
very
queer
her
eyes
look
so
strange
i
hoped
she
was
in
bed
and
asleep
said
aneta
in
bed
said
merry
not
a
bit
of
it
she
was
up
and
sitting
by
the
window
gazing
at
the
fog
i
will
go
and
see
her
myself
said
aneta
will
you
neta
and
you
will
be
kind
to
her
yes
darling
of
course
somehow
she
used
to
think
that
that
you
did
love
her
said
merry
nor
did
i
said
aneta
but
i
will
be
kind
to
her
do
be
afraid
i
think
i
can
guess
what
is
the
matter
it
is
all
very
queer
said
merry
she
was
in
such
splendid
spirits
all
the
girls
said
so
when
they
were
out
preparing
for
our
party
and
now
she
looks
years
older
and
utterly
miserable
go
to
bed
merry
and
leave
your
friend
in
my
care
then
you
do
think
it
wrong
of
me
to
be
very
fond
of
her
i
do
not
merry
there
was
a
time
when
i
hoped
you
would
not
care
for
her
now
i
earnestly
want
you
to
be
her
true
friend
there
is
a
very
great
deal
of
good
in
her
and
she
has
had
many
sorrows
pray
for
her
do
be
anxious
everything
will
come
as
right
as
possible
oh
neta
said
merry
you
are
a
darling
and
when
you
talk
like
that
i
love
you
more
than
i
ever
did
before
you
see
dear
i
could
not
help
caring
for
maggie
from
the
very
first
and
nothing
nor
anybody
can
alter
my
love
aneta
kissed
merry
who
left
the
room
then
aneta
herself
taking
up
her
candle
went
out
she
was
wearing
a
long
white
wrapper
and
her
clouds
of
golden
hair
were
falling
far
below
her
waist
she
looked
almost
like
an
angel
as
she
went
down
the
corridor
as
far
as
miss
johnson
room
lucy
johnson
was
just
getting
into
bed
when
aneta
knocked
what
is
it
neta
said
the
governess
in
a
tone
almost
of
alarm
i
want
to
break
a
rule
lucy
said
aneta
so
put
me
down
for
punishment
oh
but
why
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
am
going
to
do
something
which
i
shall
be
punished
for
i
am
going
to
spend
if
necessary
with
maggie
howland
is
she
ill
neta
ought
we
to
send
for
the
doctor
oh
no
she
is
not
a
bit
ill
in
that
way
lucy
i
felt
i
ought
to
tell
you
aneta
continued
her
way
until
she
reached
maggie
room
it
was
now
past
midnight
the
quiet
and
regular
household
had
all
retired
to
bed
and
maggie
had
feverishly
begun
to
prepare
for
departure
she
knew
how
to
let
herself
out
once
out
of
the
house
she
would
be
so
she
felt
through
the
worst
part
of
her
trouble
she
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
ways
of
this
cruel
world
and
thought
that
she
might
be
taken
in
at
some
hotel
not
too
far
away
for
the
night
early
in
the
morning
she
would
go
by
train
to
some
seaside
place
from
there
she
would
embark
for
the
continent
beyond
that
she
had
made
no
plans
maggie
was
in
the
act
of
removing
her
father
treasures
from
the
tin
boxes
when
without
any
warning
the
was
opened
and
aneta
in
her
pure
white
dress
with
her
golden
hair
surrounding
her
very
fair
face
entered
the
room
oh
said
maggie
dropping
a
curiously
made
cross
in
her
confusion
and
turning
a
dull
whatever
have
you
come
about
aneta
closed
the
door
calmly
and
placed
her
lighted
candle
on
the
top
of
maggie
chest
of
drawers
i
hoped
you
were
in
bed
and
asleep
she
said
but
instead
of
that
you
are
up
i
have
made
arrangements
to
spend
the
night
with
you
it
is
bitterly
cold
we
must
build
up
the
fire
maggie
felt
wild
aneta
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
she
knelt
down
and
put
knobs
of
fresh
coal
on
the
fire
soon
it
was
blazing
up
merrily
better
she
said
now
do
you
think
a
cup
of
cocoa
each
would
be
advisable
i
do
want
to
eat
said
maggie
i
should
like
the
cocoa
said
aneta
and
i
have
brought
it
with
me
i
thought
your
supply
might
be
out
here
your
glass
of
milk
which
you
never
drank
and
here
a
little
saucepan
and
there
are
cups
and
saucers
in
your
cupboard
and
a
box
of
biscuits
just
sit
down
you
while
i
make
the
cocoa
maggie
felt
very
strange
her
dislike
of
aneta
was
growing
less
and
less
moment
by
moment
nevertheless
she
by
no
means
gave
up
her
primary
idea
of
running
away
she
felt
that
she
must
hoodwink
aneta
surely
she
was
clever
enough
for
that
the
best
plan
would
be
to
acquiesce
in
the
cocoa
scheme
afterwards
to
pretend
that
she
was
sleepy
and
go
to
bed
then
aneta
would
of
course
leave
her
and
there
would
still
be
plenty
of
time
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
disappear
into
the
foggy
world
of
london
the
glowing
fire
the
beautiful
young
girl
kneeling
by
it
the
preparation
for
the
little
meal
which
she
made
with
such
swiftness
and
dexterity
caused
maggie
to
gaze
at
her
in
speechless
amazement
maggie
drank
her
delicious
cocoa
and
munched
her
biscuits
with
appetite
and
afterwards
she
felt
better
the
world
was
not
quite
so
black
and
desolate
and
aneta
looked
lovely
with
her
soft
eyes
glowing
and
the
in
her
cheeks
why
are
you
doing
all
this
for
me
said
maggie
then
why
said
aneta
i
think
the
reason
is
very
simple
then
she
paused
for
a
minute
and
her
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
i
think
it
is
maggie
because
quite
unexpectedly
i
have
learned
to
love
you
you
to
love
me
me
said
maggie
yes
maggie
felt
herself
trembling
she
could
not
reply
she
did
not
understand
that
she
returned
the
love
so
suddenly
given
to
her
given
to
her
too
in
her
moment
of
deepest
degradation
of
her
most
utter
misery
once
again
the
feeling
that
she
must
go
that
she
could
not
face
confession
and
the
scorn
of
the
school
and
the
awful
words
of
and
her
poor
mother
as
wife
overpowered
her
you
are
very
kind
she
said
in
a
broken
voice
and
the
cocoa
was
good
and
if
you
do
mind
i
will
go
to
bed
now
and
perhaps
sleep
a
little
what
have
you
been
doing
with
all
those
lovely
curios
said
aneta
i
said
maggie
i
oh
i
like
to
look
at
them
do
pick
up
that
cross
which
is
lying
on
the
floor
and
let
me
examine
it
maggie
did
so
rather
unwillingly
please
bring
over
all
the
other
things
and
let
me
look
at
them
said
aneta
then
maggie
obeyed
but
grudgingly
as
though
she
did
not
care
that
aneta
should
handle
them
why
have
you
taken
them
out
of
their
boxes
and
put
them
all
in
a
muddle
like
this
said
aneta
i
i
wanted
something
to
do
said
maggie
i
could
sleep
was
that
the
only
reason
honor
bright
said
aneta
maggie
dropped
her
eyes
aneta
did
not
question
her
any
further
but
she
drew
her
down
to
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
and
put
a
hand
on
her
lap
and
kept
on
looking
at
the
treasures
the
bracelets
the
crosses
the
brooches
the
quaint
designs
belonging
to
a
bygone
period
after
a
time
she
said
i
am
not
at
all
sure
i
am
not
a
real
judge
of
treasures
but
i
have
an
uncle
sir
charles
lysle
who
knows
more
about
these
things
than
any
one
else
in
london
and
if
he
thinks
what
i
am
inclined
to
think
with
regard
to
the
contents
of
these
two
boxes
you
will
be
she
stopped
abruptly
maggie
eyes
were
shining
aneta
she
said
do
talk
of
these
any
more
and
do
talk
either
of
wealth
or
poverty
any
more
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
when
you
came
into
my
room
just
now
i
was
packing
up
to
run
away
oh
yes
i
know
that
said
aneta
i
saw
that
you
had
that
intention
the
moment
i
entered
the
room
and
you
said
nothing
why
should
i
i
did
want
to
force
your
confidence
but
you
not
going
to
run
away
now
mags
she
bent
towards
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
yes
said
maggie
trembling
i
want
you
to
let
me
go
i
can
not
possibly
do
that
dear
if
you
go
i
go
too
i
must
go
said
maggie
you
do
understand
you
found
things
out
about
me
and
you
have
behaved
well
splendidly
i
did
give
you
credit
for
it
i
did
know
you
now
i
do
know
you
and
i
see
that
no
girl
in
the
school
can
be
compared
to
you
for
nobleness
and
courage
and
just
for
being
downright
splendid
but
aneta
i
can
not
bear
that
which
is
before
me
the
fact
is
said
aneta
you
are
in
the
midst
of
a
terrible
battle
and
you
mean
to
give
in
and
turn
tail
and
let
the
enemy
walk
over
the
field
that
is
not
a
bit
what
i
should
have
expected
at
one
time
from
maggie
howland
i
will
tell
you
said
maggie
i
am
not
really
a
bit
brave
there
is
nothing
good
in
me
we
wo
talk
about
that
said
aneta
what
we
have
to
think
about
now
is
what
lies
straight
ahead
of
you
not
of
your
past
any
more
but
your
immediate
future
you
have
a
tough
time
before
you
in
fact
you
have
a
very
great
battle
to
fight
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
turn
tail
you
want
me
said
maggie
to
go
to
ward
and
tell
her
everything
you
must
do
that
maggie
there
is
no
second
course
to
pursue
there
is
no
way
out
but
i
have
been
thinking
since
i
saw
you
that
perhaps
you
might
have
your
day
on
saturday
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
tell
ward
and
i
think
she
would
not
prevent
you
having
your
day
on
saturday
perhaps
it
will
be
necessary
but
she
is
the
one
to
decide
that
some
of
your
schoolfellows
should
be
told
and
of
course
your
little
brooch
which
you
sold
to
pearce
must
be
got
back
even
pearce
is
far
too
honest
to
keep
it
for
the
price
he
paid
you
he
gave
me
five
pounds
and
i
have
spent
one
there
are
still
four
pounds
left
said
maggie
i
meant
to
run
away
with
the
help
of
these
i
will
lend
you
a
pound
said
aneta
and
we
get
the
brooch
back
but
aneta
i
have
not
yet
told
you
it
is
too
fearful
you
can
not
conceive
what
my
stepfather
is
like
it
is
only
his
being
a
grocer
for
i
have
no
doubt
there
are
lots
of
grocers
who
are
quite
quite
tolerable
but
you
can
not
imagine
what
he
is
i
had
a
letter
from
him
a
little
time
ago
that
time
you
remember
when
he
sent
me
those
perfectly
awful
dresses
and
he
said
then
that
he
and
my
mother
were
coming
to
see
me
as
he
wanted
to
interview
ward
and
to
look
at
the
school
for
himself
well
that
poor
tildy
brought
me
a
letter
from
mother
i
had
written
to
mother
to
beg
of
her
not
to
let
him
come
but
he
got
hold
of
the
letter
and
he
was
nearly
mad
about
it
the
end
of
it
is
that
he
and
she
are
coming
on
and
somehow
i
ca
bear
it
i
must
run
away
i
endure
it
i
do
wonder
said
aneta
let
me
think
lay
your
head
on
my
shoulder
maggie
oh
how
tired
you
are
aneta
you
seem
to
me
quite
new
just
as
though
i
had
never
seen
you
before
i
think
you
and
your
story
have
opened
my
eyes
and
done
me
good
said
aneta
then
what
you
said
about
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
i
mean
your
sort
of
poor
gave
me
great
pain
will
you
take
off
your
things
and
lie
down
and
let
me
lie
by
your
side
do
maggie
darling
maggie
darling
such
words
to
come
from
aneta
lysle
lips
maggie
felt
subjugated
she
allowed
her
rival
queen
to
undress
her
and
presently
the
two
girls
were
lying
side
by
side
in
the
little
bed
maggie
dropped
off
into
heavy
slumber
aneta
lay
awake
it
was
early
morning
when
aneta
touched
her
companion
maggie
i
have
been
thinking
hard
all
night
and
i
am
going
to
do
something
you
what
can
you
do
oh
i
remember
everything
now
oh
the
horror
oh
how
can
i
endure
it
why
did
i
run
away
maggie
you
must
promise
me
faithfully
that
you
will
never
run
away
say
it
now
this
minute
i
believe
in
your
word
i
believe
in
your
fine
nature
i
will
help
you
with
all
my
might
and
main
through
and
afterwards
give
me
your
word

poor
maggie

but
i
will
ask
miss
johnson

to
see

your
stepfather
aneta

not
easily
alarmed

will
take
aunt
lucia

me
i
am
going

with
the
preparations

believe
we

have
our
happy
day
chapter
xxiii
at
laburnum
villa
aneta
went
back
to
her
room
where
she
dressed
with
her
usual
expedition
and
extreme
neatness
when
she
had
finished
her
toilet
she
ran
downstairs
it
was
not
yet
eight
but
most
of
the
girls
were
assembled
in
the
large
hall
waiting
for
prayers
which
always
took
place
before
breakfast
ward
was
seen
passing
to
the
library
where
prayers
were
held
aneta
went
up
to
her
prayers
first
of
course
said
aneta
and
afterwards
may
i
talk
to
you
ward
looked
at
aneta
what
is
the
matter
dear
something
very
important
indeed
i
must
see
you
well
breakfast
follows
prayers
come
to
me
the
minute
breakfast
is
over
thank
you
dear
ward
said
aneta
at
breakfast
merry
asked
aneta
how
maggie
was
aneta
said
that
maggie
had
a
headache
and
would
not
be
in
school
during
the
morning
then
what
are
we
to
do
about
our
day
said
molly
tristram
who
overheard
this
remark
we
have
absolutely
more
to
get
through
than
we
can
possibly
manage
oh
will
be
quite
all
right
said
aneta
and
maggie
will
join
you
presently
aneta
was
so
respected
in
the
school
so
little
given
to
exaggeration
so
absolutely
to
be
relied
on
that
these
words
of
hers
had
a
most
calming
effect
the
girls
continued
their
breakfast
those
who
were
in
the
secret
of
occasionally
alluding
to
the
subject
in
french
which
was
the
only
language
allowed
to
be
spoken
the
others
talked
about
their
different
occupations
as
soon
as
ever
breakfast
was
over
aneta
went
to
ward
private
room
now
dear
what
is
it
said
the
i
have
to
take
the
class
for
literature
at
nine
and
have
very
little
time
to
spare
i
wo
keep
you
said
aneta
but
what
i
wanted
was
to
beg
for
a
day
holiday
my
dear
girl
what
do
you
mean
in
the
middle
of
term
a
holiday
can
you
not
take
it
oh
i
forgot
maggie

having
her
grand
carnival
as
i
call
it
but

the
matter

you
any
trouble
yes
said
aneta
and
i
can
not
tell
you
dear
mrs
ward
i
trust
you
of
course
aneta
i
know
you
do
and
i
want
you
to
trust
me
more
than
ever
it
has
something
to
do
with
maggie
ward
slightly
frowned
i
am
never
sure
she
began
but
aneta
stopped
her
impulsively
if
you
give
me
that
holiday
she
said
and
if
you
trust
me
and
if
you
will
also
give
me
martin
address
which
of
course
you
must
have
on
your
books
martin
address
said
ward
yes
you
know
maggie
mother

married
again
she
is
mrs
martin
of
course
of
course
i
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
yes
i
have
her
address
well
if
you
will
do
all
that
continued
aneta
i
think
that
you
will
find
a
new
maggie
in
the
future
one
whom
you
will
trust
and
and
love
as
i
love
her
my
dear
girl
as
you
love
maggie
howland
aneta
lowered
her
head
for
a
minute
it
is
true
i
did
not
love
her
she
said
in
the
past
but
i
have
changed
my
views
i
have
been
and
small
and
silly
she
herself
has
opened
my
eyes
i
can
not
tell
you
more
now
maggie
will
come
down
and
will
be
able
to
go
on
with
her
lessons
just
as

this
afternoon
but
i

will
let
me
have
a
cab
and
i
will
drive
to
aunt
lucia
house
in
eaton
square
at
once
ward
looked
doubtful
you
have
a
very
grave
reason
for
this
she
said
very
very
grave
and
i
will
tell
you
all
presently
i
have
never
had
reason
to
doubt
you
said
ward
and
i
doubt
you
now
does
maggie
know
of
this
yes
oh

but
please
do
question
her
until
i
return
very
well
dear
you
shall
have
your
way
oh

want
address
it
is
laburnum
villa
clapham
aneta
entered
the
address
in
a
little
tablet
bound
in
gold
which
she
always
wore
at
her
waist
thank
you
ever
so
much
she
said
and
then
left
the
room
a
minute
or
two
later
she
met
miss
johnson
give
me
something
stiff
to
learn
something
that
i
do
like
dear
lucy
she
said
i
am
off
for
a
whole
day
holiday
but
i
shall
be
back
in
the
evening
that
is
very
queer
said
miss
johnson
what
does
it
mean
i
can
not
explain
but
ward
knows
be
specially
kind
to
dear
maggie
and
give
me
something
that
i
do
like
to

when
i

miss
johnson
smiled
you
shall
hem
some
dusters
she
said
aneta
made
a
wry
face
thanks
ever
so
much
she
replied
then
she
ran
upstairs
to
get
ready
for
her
visit
just
before
leaving
the
house
she
looked
in
at
maggie
i
off
mags
it
all
right
i
shall
probably
see
you
about
before
maggie
had
time
even
to
expostulate
aneta
closed
the
door
and
a
minute
or
two
later
had
stepped
into
the
cab
which
agnes
had
called
for
her
the
cabman
was
desired
to
drive
miss
lysle
to
lady
house
in
eaton
square
this
was
accordingly
done
and
soon
after
ten
lady
lysle
who
had
not
yet
completed
her
morning
toilet
was
most
amazed
at
being
informed
by
her
maid
that
miss
lysle
was
waiting
for
her
downstairs
aneta
you
do
mean
aneta
purcell
yes
my
lady
and
she
wants
to
see
you
in
a
very
great
hurry
then
send
her
up
to
me
purcell
disappeared
lady
lysle
wondered
what
was
wrong
presently
aneta
burst
into
the
room
my
dear
child
said
her
aunt
what
can
be
wrong
why
have
you
left
school
i
do
hope
no
illness
has
broken
out
there
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
for
me
to
have
you
here
at
present
there
is
no
illness
whatever
at
the
school
aunt
lucia
said
aneta
going
up
to
her
aunt
and
kissing
her
only
there
is
a
girl
there
one
of
my
schoolfellows
in
a
good
bit
of
trouble
and
i
want
to
help
her
and
i
have
got
a
day
off
from
ward
who
does
know
why
she
is
giving
it
to
me
but
trusts
me
all
the
same
and
now
auntie
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
at
once
oh
my
dear
child
where

my
life

aneta
at

lady
lysle

miss
howland

you
know
i
told
you
that
her
stepfather
is
no
relation
whatever
to
the
martyns
of
the
meadows
i
can
not
make
out
why
she
should
have
given
you
to
understand
that
he
was
a
man
who
lives
at
clapham
dear
aneta
i
would
rather
be
excused
there
is
no
excuse
auntie

single
moment

all
about
maggie
stepfather
and
i
will

my
own
way
and
i
have
yes
i
have
tried
to
be
a
good
girl
but
there

something
before

more
important
and
more
difficult
than
i
ever
tackled
yet
and
if
i
ca
come
to
my
own
aunt
i
who
am
a
motherless
girl
for
help

this
crisis

shall
think
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
what
a
strange
earnest
way
you
do
speak
in
aneta
i
am
very
sorry

i
assure
you
the
case

most
urgent

of

somewhere
else
after
we
have
done
with
mrs
martin
well
aneta
i
always
was
wax
in
your
hands
and
i
suppose
i
must
do
what
you
wish
but
remember
your
promise
that
you
will
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
thing
during
our
drive
to
clapham
i
promise
faithfully
to
tell
you
what
is
necessary
for
the
fact
is
i
want
your
help
darling
auntie
you
are
doing
about
the
best
work
of
your
life
i
knew
you
would
stand
by
me
i
felt
certain
of
it
and
i
told
maggie
so
that
girl
said
lady
lysle
i
do
care
for
that
girl
you
will
change
your
mind
about
her
presently
said
aneta
and
she
ran
downstairs
to
request
davidson
the
butler
to
bring
her
something
to
eat
for
her
breakfast
had
been
slight
and
she
was
quite
hungry
enough
to
enjoy
some
of
her
aunt
nice
food
lady
lysle
looking
slim
and
beautiful
wearing
her
becoming
sables
and
her
toque
with
its
long
black
ostrich
plume
appeared
on
the
scene
and
a
minute
later
davidson
announced
that
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
the
two
ladies
stepped
in
aneta
giving
very
careful
directions
to
the
driver
he
expressed
some
astonishment
at
the
address
laburnum
villa
clapham
he
said
martin
laburnum
villa
clapham
clapham
a
big
place
miss
i
know
that
said
aneta
but
that
is
all
the
address
i
can
obtain
we
must
call
at
the
if
necessary
to
get
the
name
of
the
street
the
footman
sprang
into
his
place
and
aneta
and
her
aunt
drove
off
in
the
comfortable
brougham
towards
that
suburb
known
as
clapham
now
aneta
i
suppose
you
will
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
yes
i
will
said
aneta
i
made
a
mistake
about
maggie
and
i
am
willing
to
own
it
she
has
been
placed
in
a
difficult
position
i
do
not
mean
for
a
minute
to
imply
that
she
has
acted
in
a
straight
way
for
she
has
not
but
there
is
that
in
her
which
will
make
her
the
best
of
girls
in
the
future
as
she
is
one
of
the
cleverest
and
one
of
the
most
charming
yes
auntie
she
has
got
a
great
power
about
her
she
is
a
sort
of
magnet
she
attracts
people
to
her
she
has
never
attracted
me
said
lady
lysle
i
have
always
thought
her
a
singularly
plain
girl
ugliness
like
hers
is
really
attractive
said
aneta
but
now
the
thing
is
this
if
we
do
help
her
she
will
be
absolutely
lost
all
her
chance
taken
from
her
and
her
character
ruined
for
ever
we
do
a
lot
at
our
school
for
those
poor
but
we
never
do
anything
for
girls
in
our
class
now
i
mean
my
girl
in
future
to
be
maggie
howland
aneta
you
are
absurd
i
mean
it
auntie
her
father
daughter
deserves
help
her
father
was
as
good
a
man
as
ever
lived
and
for
his
sake
something
ought
to
be
done
for
his
only
child
as
to
her
mother
yes
the
woman
who
has
married
a
person
of
the
name
of
martin
and
to
whose
house
i
presume
we
are
going
auntie
i
have
rather
a
shock
to
give
you
poor
maggie
did
mean
to
imply
that
her
stepfather
was
in
a
different
class
of
life
from
what
he
is
he
is
a
grocer
lady
lysle
put
up
her
hand
to
pull
the
pray
auntie
do
do
that
maggie
is
the
daughter
of
a
grocer
and
she
ca
help
her
mother
having
married
this
dreadful
man
i
want
maggie
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
stepfather
in
the
future
and
i
mean
to
carry
out
my
ideas
and
you
have
got
to
help
me
indeed
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
what
a
disgraceful
girl
she
must
leave
aylmer
house
at
once
then
i
will
go
too
said
aneta
aneta
i
never
knew
you
behave
in
such
a
way
before
come
auntie
darling
you
know
you
are
the
sweetest
and
the
most
loving
and
sympathetic
person
in
the
world
and
why
should
you
turn
away
from
a
poor
little
girl
who
quite
against
her
own
will
finds
herself
the
stepdaughter
of
a
grocer
maggie
has
given
me
to
understand
that
he
is
a
dreadful
man
she
is
horrified
with
him
and
what
i
am
going
now
to
laburnum
villa
about
is
to
try
to
prevent
his
visiting
the
school
with
his
wife
on
saturday
i
will
do
the
talking
dear
and
you
have
only
to
sit
by
and
look
dignified
i
never
was
put
in
such
a
dreadful
position
before
said
lady
lysle
and
really
even
you
aneta
go
too
far
when
you
expect
me
to
do
this
but
you
would
visit
a
poor
woman
in
east
london
without
the
smallest
compunction
said
aneta
that
is
different
replied
lady
lysle
with
dignity
it
is
different
replied
aneta
but
the
difference
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
grocer
wife
is
very
much
higher
up
in
the
social
scale
than
the
east
end
woman
oh
my
dear
child
this
is
really
appalling
i
have
always
distrusted
that
miss
howland
does
ward
know
of
your
project
not
yet
but
she
will
and
what
am
i
to
do
when
i
visit
this
person
just
look
your
dear
sweet
dignified
self
and
allow
me
to
do
the
talking
i
think
you
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
i
have
taken
leave
of
my
senses
and
i
would
do
more
than
i
am
now
doing
to
help
a
fine
girl
round
a
nasty
corner
so
cheer
up
auntie
after
we
have
seen
martin
we
have
to
go
on
and
visit
the
grocer
aneta
that
i
do
decline
i
am
sure
you
wo
decline
but
let
us
think
of
martin
herself
first
and
try
to
remember
that
by
birth
she
is
a
lady
just
at
this
moment
the
carriage
drew
up
outside
a
there
was
a
short
delay
while
laburnum
villa
was
being
inquired
for
by
the
footman
at
last
the
street
in
which
this
small
suburban
dwelling
was
situated
was
discovered
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
carriage
with
its
splendid
horses
and
two
servants
on
the
box
drew
up
before
the
door
the
villa
was
small
but
it
was
exceedingly
neat
the
little
brass
knocker
shone
even
though
yesterday
was
a
day
of
such
fog
the
footman
came
to
the
to
make
inquiries
i
will
get
out
said
aneta
had
james
best
inquire
if
the
woman
is
in
said
lady
lysle
no
i
think
i
will
said
aneta
she
went
up
the
narrow
path
and
rang
the
bell
tildy
opened
the
door
the
new
cook
had
been
peeping
above
the
blinds
in
the
kitchen
tildy
had
hastily
put
on
a
white
apron
but
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
a
smut
was
once
more
on
her
cheek
somehow
aneta
liked
her
all
the
better
for
that
smut
i
want
to
see
your
mistress
tildy
she
said
it
is
something
about
miss
maggie
and

of
her
schoolfellows
lor
miss
yes

certain

that
proud
miss

aneta
she

martin

into
the
said
aneta
she
ran
back
to
fetch
lady
lysle
and
conducted
that
amazed
and
indignant
woman
into
the
house
tildy
rushed
upstairs
to
fetch
her
mistress
you
get
into
your
best
gown
in
no
time
mum
there
visitors
downstairs
that
most
beauteous
young
lady
who

yesterday
at
aylmer

and
a
lady
alongside

morning
said
martin
tildy
helped
her
into
a
merino
dress
one
of
her
extensive
trousseau
martin
then
went
downstairs
prepared
to
show
these
visitors
that
she
was
as
good
as
them
if
not
better
but
the
glimpse
of
the
carriage
and
horses
which
she
got
through
the
very
nearly
bowled
her
over
go
in
mum
now
you
kept
them
waitin
long
enough
i
can
serve
up
an
elegant
lunch
if
you
want
it
tildy
felt
almost
inclined
to
poke
at
her
mistress
in
order
to
hurry
her
movements
martin
opened
the
door
and
stood
just
for
a
minute
on
the
threshold
she
looked
at
that
moment
a
perfect
lady
her
gentle
faded
face
and
extreme
slimness
gave
her
a
grace
of
demeanor
which
lady
lysle
was
quick
to
acknowledge
she
bowed
and
looked
at
aneta
to
speak
for
her
how
do
you
do
martin
said
that
young
lady
i
am
aneta
lysle
one
of
your
daughter
schoolfellows
my
aunt
lady
lysle
martin
bowed
has
kindly
come
with
me
to
see
you
we
want
to
have
a
little
confidential
talk
with
you
oh
indeed
said
martin
has
maggie
done
anything
wrong
she
always
was
a
particularly
troublesome
girl
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
lady
lysle
at
that
moment
she
had
an
idea
of
maggie
in
disgrace
and
banished
from
aylmer
house
which
pleased
her
martin
stopped
speaking
when
lady
lysle
said
this
doubtless
you
agree
with
me
martin
continued
the
lady
that
your
daughter
would
do
better
at
another
school
oh
no
said
martin
we
wish
her
and
i
i
mean
james
and
i
to
stay
where
she
is
and
so
do
i
wish
her
to
stay
where
she
is
said
auntie
darling
you
do
quite
understand
but
martin
and
i
do
we
mrs
martin
well
i
am
sure
said
martin
i
have
the
faintest
idea
what
you
are
driving
at
miss
miss
lysle
well
it
is
just
this
said
aneta
you
sent
a
letter
yesterday
to
maggie
i
did
said
martin
and
great
need
i
had
to
send
it
in
that
letter
you
informed
maggie
that
you
and
your
husband
were
coming
to
see
her
wishes
i
mean
james
wishes
to
really
aneta
had
not
we
better
go
said
lady
lysle
not
yet
auntie
mrs
martin
i
begged
for
a
holiday
on
purpose
to
come
and
see
you
if
it
because
you
think
i
keep
james
i
mean
james
from
having
his
heart
wish
i
am
sorry
you
have
wasted
your
time
said
martin
the
fact
is
he
is
very
angry
indeed
with
maggie
he
considers
her
his
own
child
now
which
of
course
is
true
seeing
that
he
has
married
me
and
i
really
ca
go
into
particulars
but
he
is
determined
to
see
her
and
to
see
ward
and
he
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
being
being
well
what
he
is
an
honorable
tradesman
a
grocer
but
perhaps
you
are
aware
said
lady
lysle
that
the
daughters
of
grocers
i
mean
tradesmen
are
not
admitted
to
aylmer
house
martin
turned
her
frightened
eyes
on
the
lady
maggie
is
the
real
daughter
of
a
tradesman
she
said
then
she
is
only
the
stepdaughter
her
own
father
was
yes
said
aneta
we
all
know
what
her
own
father
was
a
splendid
man
one
of
the
makers
of
our
empire
we
are
all
proud
of
her
own
father
and
we
do
not
see
for
a
moment
why
maggie
should
not
live
up
to
the
true
circumstances
of
her
birth
and
i
have
come
here
martin
to
ask
you
to
help
me
if
you
and
your
husband
come
to
aylmer
house
there
will
be
no
help
for
maggie
will
certainly
have
to
leave
the
school
of
course
and
the
sooner
the
better
said
lady
lysle
but
if
you
will
help
us
and
prevent
your
husband
from
coming
to
our
school
there
is
no
reason
whatever
why
she
should
stay
at
the
school
even
her
expenses
can
be
paid
from
quite
another
source
martin
looked
intensely
nervous
a
bright
spot
of
color
came
into
her
left
cheek
her
right
cheek
was
deadly
pale
i
i
can
not
help
it
she
said
i
never
meant
to
go
i
never
wished
him
to
go
but
he
said
i
will
go
i
i
forgot
myself
of
course
you
do
understand
he
is
a
very
good
husband
to
me
but
he
and
maggie
never
get
on
i
am
sure
they
do
said
aneta
with
fervor
never
continued
martin
i
got
on
with
her
only
with
difficulty
before
i
married
my
present
dear
husband
i
am
not
at
all
ashamed
of
his
being
a
grocer
he
gives
me
comforts
and
is
fond
of
me
and
i
have
a
much
better
time
with
him
than
i
had
in
shabby
dirty
lodgings
at
shepherd
bush
i
do
want
him
to
go
to
that
school
but
i
thought
it
right
to
let
maggie
know
he
was
coming
for
all
the
same
go
he
will
when
james
puts
his
foot
down
he
is
a
very
determined
man
this
is
altogether
a
most
unpleasant
interview
said
lady
lysle
and
i
have
only
come
here
at
my
niece
perhaps
aneta
we
can
go
now
not
yet
auntie
mrs
martin
maggie
and
i
had
a
long
talk
yesterday
and
will
you
put
this
matter
into
my
hands
good
heavens
what
next
murmured
lady
lysle
to
herself
will
you
give
me
your
husband
address
and
may
i
go
to
see
him
you
mean
the
the
shop
said
martin
i
do
go
into
that
shop
said
lady
lysle
yes
i
mean
the
shop
said
aneta
i
want
to
go
and
see
him
there
oh
he
will
be
so
angry
and
i
am
really
terrified
of
him
when
he
is
angry
but
think
how
much
more
angry
he
will
be
if
you
do
give
me
that
address
and
things
happen
which
you
little
expect
oh
please
trust
me
aneta
said
a
few
more
words
and
in
the
end
she
was
in
possession
of
that
address
at
shepherd
bush
where
martin
the
grocer
flourishing
shop
was
to
be
found
thank
you
so
very
much
martin
i
do
think
you
will
ever
regret
this
said
the
girl
lady
lysle
bowed
to
the
wife
of
the
grocer
as
she
went
out
but
aneta
took
her
hand
perhaps
you
never
quite
understood
maggie
she
said
and
perhaps
in
the
future
you
wo
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
i
do
want
to
she
never
suited
me
a
bit
said
the
mother
and
i
am
very
happy
with
well
at
least
you
may
feel
said
aneta
that
i
am
going
to
be
maggie
special
friend
martin
stood
silent
while
lady
lysle
and
her
niece
walked
down
the
little
path
and
got
into
the
carriage
when
the
carriage
rolled
away
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
glad
or
sorry
but
somehow
she
had
faith
in
aneta
was
she
never
going
to
see
maggie
again
she
was
not
quite
without
maternal
love
for
her
only
child
but
she
cared
very
much
more
for
and
quite
felt
that
maggie
would
be
a
most
troublesome
inmate
of
laburnum
villa
now
aneta
said
her
aunt
as
the
carriage
rolled
away
i
have
gone
through
enough
in
your
service
for
one
day
you
have
been
at
all
nice
auntie
said
aneta
but
perhaps
you
will
be
better
when
you
get
to
the
shop
i
will
not
go
to
the
shop
auntie
just
think
once
and
for
all
that
you
are
doing
a
very
philanthropic
act
and
that
you
are
helping
me
whom
you
love
so
dearly
of
course
i
love
you
aneta
are
you
not
as
my
own
precious
child
well
now
i
want
you
to
buy
no
end
of
things
at
martin
shop
buy
things
good
gracious
child
at
a
grocer
shop
but
i
get
all
my
groceries
at
the
stores
and
the
housekeeper
attends
to
my
orders
well
anyhow
spend
from
five
to
ten
pounds
at
martin
you
can
get
tea
made
up
in
packets
and
give
it
away
wholesale
to
your
poor
women
christmas
is
coming
on
and
they
will
appreciate
good
tea
no
matter
where
it
has
been
bought
from
well
you
may
go
in
and
give
the
order
said
lady
lysle
but
i
wo
see
that
grocer
i
will
sit
in
the
carriage
and
wait
for
you
aneta
considered
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
in
a
sad
voice
very
well
lady
lysle
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
during
the
long
drive
which
followed
aneta
little
face
was
rather
pale
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
subdued
fire
she
was
determined
to
carry
the
day
at
any
cost
chapter
xxiv
a
visit
to
the
grocer
james
martin
abhorred
the
aristocracy
so
he
said
nevertheless
he
greatly
admired
his
elegant
wife
in
her
faded
beauty
he
liked
to
hear
her
speak
and
he
made
some
effort
to
copy
her
genteel
pronunciation
he
also
in
his
inmost
heart
admired
maggie
as
a
girl
of
spirit
although
not
a
beautiful
one
he
had
his
own
ideas
with
regard
to
female
loveliness
and
like
all
men
was
impressed
and
attracted
by
it
on
this
special
foggy
day
as
he
was
standing
behind
his
counter
busily
engaged
attending
to
a
customer
who
was
only
requiring
a
small
order
to
be
made
up
he
gave
a
visible
start
raised
his
eyes
dropped
his
let
his
pencil
roll
on
to
the
floor
and
stared
straight
before
him
for
somebody
was
coming
into
the
shop
somebody
so
very
beautiful
that
his
eyes
were
dazzled
and
as
he
said
afterwards
his
heart
melted
within
him
a
girl
with
wonderful
blue
eyes
and
hair
of
the
color
of
pure
gold
a
girl
with
a
refined
face
most
beautifully
dressed
although
martin
could
not
quite
make
out
in
what
fashion
she
was
apparelled
came
quickly
up
to
the
counter
and
then
stood
still
waiting
for
some
one
to
attend
to
her
the
other
men
in
the
shop
also
saw
this
lovely
vision
and
an
attendant
of
the
name
of
turtle
sprang
forward
to
ask
what
he
could
do

the
silvery
voice
martin
felt
pleased
and
said
chuck
it
turtle
out
of
it
old
boy
a
minute
later
he
was
standing
before
aneta
inquiring
in
a
trembling
voice

he
could
do
for
her

lady
lysle
i
will
enter
her
ladyship
name
in
my
book
yes
it
shall
be
done
said
martin
he
looked
at
aneta
and
aneta
looked
straight
back
at
him
martin
she
said
suddenly
i
am
the
of
your
stepdaughter
maggie
howland
may
i
have
a
little
conversation
with
you
in
your
private
room
ah
i
thought
there
was
something
said
martin
to
be
sure
miss
he
turtle
you
see
that
this
order
is
it
for
her
ladyship
lady
lysle
eaton
come
this
way
my
lady
i
am
only
miss
lysle
said
aneta
all
the
attendants
in
the
shop
gazed
in
wonder
as
the
beautiful
girl
and
the
excited
martin
went
into
the
little
parlor
at
the
back
of
the
business
establishment
there
martin
stood
with
his
hands
behind
him
but
aneta
sank
into
a
low
chair
i
want
to
ask
you
a
great
favor
martin
said
the
girl
she
looked
full
up
at
him
as
she
spoke
martin
thought
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
seen
such
melting
and
lovely
blue
eyes
before
she
bowls
me
over
he
kept
saying
to
himself
i
hate
the
aristocrats
but
somehow
she
bowls
me
over
anything
in
my
power
miss
he
said
aloud
and
he
made
a
low
bow
pressing
his
hand
to
his
chest
i
think
said
aneta
indeed
i
am
sure
to
judge
from
your
most
flourishing
shop
that
you
are
a
good
business
man
well
now
there
no
doubt
on
that
point
miss
miss
lysle
but
you
would
like
to
extend
your
custom
said
aneta
business
is
always
business
to
me
replied
martin
well
the
fact
is
it
lies
in
my
power
to
induce
my
aunt
lady
lysle
to
get
her
groceries
from
you
she
has
a
large
establishment
and
sees
a
great
deal
of
company
she
gets
them
now
at
the
army
and
navy
stores
but
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
she
would
not
object
to
have
them
from
you
you
are
exceedingly
good
miss
lysle
and
i
am
sure
anything
that
her
ladyship
ordered
should
have
my
very
best
attention
in
fact
i
should
make
it
my
business
to
get
in
specially
good
things
for
her
if
i
might
let
you
into
a
business
secret
miss
the
people
round
here
do
want
the
very
best
things
they
do
so
to
speak
appreciate
them
i
quite
understand
that
said
aneta
of
course
lady
lysle
would
require
the
very
best
she
should
have
the
best
miss
i
be
proud
of
her
custom
things
should
be
punctually
delivered
just
an
order
overnight
and
my
cart
would
convey
them
to
her
ladyship
door
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
day
yes
it
could
be
arranged
said
aneta
then
perhaps
miss
said
martin
who
saw
brilliant
prospects
opening
before
him
and
the
possibility
of
a
west
end
shop
a
genuine
west
end
shop
being
his
as
well
as
the
profitable
establishment
at
shepherd
bush
her
ladyship
might
be
so
kind
as
to
recommend
me
to
others
it
is
possible
said
aneta
coldly
but
of
course
i
can
only
speak
for
my
aunt
herself
then
she
added
and
even
for
her
i
can
not
quite
speak
although
i
believe
the
matter
can
be
arranged
i
have
given
you
a
large
order
you
have
miss
lysle
and
most
faithfully
will
it
be
attended
to
martin
took
out
his
red
silk
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
forehead
now
said
aneta
gently
i
have
come
here
all
the
way
from
aylmer
house
and
practically
given
up
a
day
of
my
for
nothing
i
have
come
on
behalf
of
another
ho
ho
said
martin
so
the
cat
going
to
be
let
out
of
the
bag
aneta
colored
martin
saw
he
had
gone
too
far
and
immediately
apologized
you
will
forgive
my
coarse
way
of
expressing
myself
miss
i
know
it
is
done
in
your
circle
it
does
matter
said
aneta
i
will
come
to
the
point
at
once
i
am
interested
in
miss
howland
ah
my
little
stepdaughter
i
keep
her
at
a
fine
smart
school
i
i
do
the
knowing
by
her
do
i
well
all
i
want
you
to
do
in
future
and
i
believe
her
mother
will
consent
for
i
have
seen
martin
this
morning
you
went
to
laburnum
villa
this
morning
tasty
place
that
eh
yes
a
very
comfortable
sort
of
house
my
aunt
lady
lysle
and
i
went
together
her
ladyship
and
you
we
drove
there
i
hope
the
neighbors
saw
said
martin
they
come
in
shoals
to
see
after
they
peeped
at
her
ladyship
carriage
aneta
could
scarcely
keep
back
a
smile
martin
she
said
if
i
do
what
i
intend
for
you
and
it
lies
in
my
power
will
you
please
not
come
to
aylmer
house
ho
hi

why
not
ashamed
of
me
eh
not
at
all
said
aneta
i
am
not
ashamed
of
you
in
your
walk
in
life
but
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
maggie
if
you
did
not
come
therefore
i
ask
you
not
to
do
so
but
the
girl
my
girl
no
she
is
her
mother
daughter
and
to
tell
the
truth
we
all
want
i
mean
my
aunt
and
i
and
others
to
have
her
to
ourselves
at
least
until
she
is
educated
but
come
now
miss
that
all
very
fine
who
pays
for
her
education
her
father
money

martin

aneta
that

martin
i
ask
you
to

to
my
aunt
lady
lysle
of
eaton
square
and
to
any
friends

the
sole
condition

maggie
howland

definite
promise
to

maggie
alone
my
aunt
must
make
a
definite
promise
to
you
lady
lysle
was
much
astonished
as
she
sat
wearily
in
her
carriage
when
a
stout
grocer
accompanied
her
elegant
young
niece
to
the
aunt
lucia
said
aneta
this
is
mr
martin
lady
lysle

the
faintest
inclination
of
her
head
proud
to

martin

aneta

aneta
my
dear

watson
my
housekeeper

watson
said
aneta
springing
lightly
into
the
carriage
her
face
all
beams
and
it
is
quite
right
martin
and
you
will
get
your
second
order
this
evening
you
forget
about
the
tea
and
currants
and
sugar
for
the
poor
now
auntie
will
you
drive
me
back
to
aylmer
house
or
shall
we
go
straight
to
eaton
square
eaton
square
i
think
mr
martin
the
carriage
rolled
out
of
sight
martin
stood
bareheaded
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
there
was
not
a
prouder
man
than
he
in
the
whole
of
christendom
when
he
returned
to
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
shop
itself
he
said
to
turtle
fresh
customer
turtle
west
end
turtle
that
a
fine
young
lady
eh
turtle
the
most
beautiful
young
female
i
ever
saw
returned
turtle
when
i
ask
you
what
you
think
of
her
personal
appearance
you
can
tell
me
turtle
now
go
and
attend
to
the
shop
meanwhile
aneta
her
heart
full
of
thankfulness
accompanied
her
aunt
to
eaton
square
i
have
got
what
i
want
she
said
and
dear
maggie
is
practically
saved
and
you
have
done
it
auntie
you
will
feel
happier
for
this
to
your
dying
day
lady
lysle
said
that
at
the
present
moment
she
did
not
feel
specially
elated
at
the
thought
of
getting
her
tea
and
numerous
groceries
at
a
shop
in
shepherd
bush
but
aneta
assured
her
that
that
was
a
very
tiny
sacrifice
to
make
for
so
great
an
end
as
she
had
in
view
it
will
help
martin
she
said
he
is
not
a
gentleman
and
does
pretend
to
be
but
he
a
good
honest
tradesman
and
perhaps
ward
too
will
give
him
some
of
her
custom
well
my
dear
aneta
if
you
happy
i
have
nothing
to
say
responded
her
aunt
but
you
must
tackle
watson
for
i
really
can
not
attempt
it
aneta
did
tackle
the
old
housekeeper
to
some
purpose
at
first
there
were
objections
protests
exclamations
but
aneta
was
sure
of
her
ground
did
not
watson
idolize
the
girl
having
known
her
from
her
earliest
days
about
a
tired
and
triumphant
girl
returned
to
aylmer
house
she
had
had
her
way
the
great
difficulty
was
overcome
maggie
looking
pale
and
tired
was
having
tea
with
the
others
aneta
sat
down
by
her
side
maggie
turned
anxious
eyes
towards
the
queen
of
the
school
whom
she
used
to
fear
and
almost
hate
but
there
was
no
hatred
now
in
maggie
eyes
far
far
from
that
she
looked
upon
aneta
as
a
refuge
in
the
storm
if
aneta
could
not
get
her
out
of
her
present
trouble
no
one
could
you
will
be
very
busy
during
the
leisure
hours
this
afternoon
said
aneta
when
the
meal
was
coming
to
an
end
but
first
of
all
i
want
to
speak
to
you
just
for
a
minute
or
two
yes
said
maggie
we
have
done
tea
now
may
maggie
and
i
go
away
by
ourselves
please
miss
johnson
for
a
few
minutes
said
aneta
miss
johnson
signified
her
consent
and
the
two
queens
left
the
room
together
the
other
girls
looked
after
them
wondering
vaguely
what
was
up
maggie
said
aneta
i
have
managed
everything
aneta
you
have
yes
he
is
coming
nor
is
your
mother
and
aunt
lucia
has
invited
you
to
spend
the
christmas
holidays
with
us
you
can
see
your
mother
occasionally
but
somehow
or
other
maggie
dear
you
are
to
be
my
friend
in
future
and
oh
maggie
oh
aneta
how
can
i
ever
ever
thank
you
well
the
beginning
of
the
way
is
a
little
hard
said
aneta
come
now
at
once
straight
to
ward
and
tell
her
every
single
thing
she
will
expel
me
if
i
do
said
maggie
that
i
know
she
will
not
she
is
too
true
and
dear
and
kind
besides
i
will
stay
with
you
all
the
time
while
you
are
telling
her
come
quick
you
can
get
your
confession
over
in
a
very
few
minutes
oh
aneta
for
you
i
would
do
anything
but
how
did
you
manage
to
get
my
dreadful
stepfather
to
give
up
his
plan
that
matters
little
he
has
given
it
up
now
come
there
much
to
do
to
prepare
for
but
you
must
get
your
confession
over
first
ward
always
had
her
tea
alone
and
she
was
just
finishing
it
on
this
special
evening
when
there
came
a
tap
at
her
door
and
to
her
great
amazement
aneta
and
maggie
entered
holding
each
hands
ward
maggie
has
something
to
say
to
you
yes
said
maggie
and
then
in
a
few
broken
words
choked
by
tears
of
true
repentance
she
told
her
story
she
had
been
ashamed
of
her
stepfather
she
had
been
deceitful
she
had
been
afraid
to
confess
that
she
was
taken
at
a
lower
fee
than
the
other
girls
at
the
school
she
had
gone
out
without
leave
to
sell
one
of
her
own
treasures
everything
was
told
ward
looked
very
grave
as
the
girl
with
bent
head
related
the
story
of
her
deceit
and
i
know
you
can
expel
me
said
maggie
but
you
will
not
said
aneta
i
feel
sure
of
that
for
i
who
never
cared
for
maggie
until
now
love
her
with
all
my
heart
there
will
be
no
rivalry
in
the
school
any
more
and
dear
maggie
must
not
go
oh
if
you
would
keep
me
if
you
would
keep
me
said
maggie
and
give
me
one
more
chance
have
you
asked
god
to
forgive
you
maggie
said
ward
i
can
not
somehow
my
heart
is
so
cold
but
if
if
you
would
we
will
ask
him
together
said
ward
there
and
then
she
knelt
down
and
aneta
and
maggie
knelt
at
each
side
of
her
and
she
said
a
few
words
of
prayer
which
touched
heart
as
no
words
had
ever
touched
it
before
keep
from
her
all
hurtful
things
and
give
her
those
things
which
are
necessary
for
her
salvation
pleaded
the
mistress
suddenly
ward
hand
was
taken
by
maggie
and
covered
with
kisses
oh
i
will
try
she
said
i
will
try
hard
to
be
really
good
and
she
added
i
will
take
any
punishment
you
give
me
ward
looked
at
her
with
sparkling
eyes
she
was
a
very
keen
observer
of
character
she
put
her
hand
under
the
girl
chin
and
looked
into
her
downcast
face
my
dear
she
said
full
and
absolute
forgiveness
means
the
doing
away
with
punishment
you
have
suffered
sorely
i
will
not
add
to
your
suffering
in
any
way
now
go
and
prepare
for
aneta
you
will
stay
with
me
for
a
few
minutes
maggie
left
the
room
but
in
a
short
time
she
returned
she
carried
in
her
arms
the
two
tin
boxes
which
contained
her
father
treasures
i
want
you
to
keep
these
for
me
or
to
sell
them
or
to
do
what
you
like
with
them
said
maggie
she
then
immediately
left
the
room
ward
and
aneta
bent
over
the
treasures
ward
gave
a
start
of
great
surprise
when
she
saw
them
why
these
she
said
are
a
fortune
in
themselves
i
thought
so
said
aneta
her
eyes
sparkling
i
felt
sure
of
it
we
must
get
that
brooch
back
from
pearce
yes
aneta
i
will
send
miss
johnson
round
for
it
at
once
what
did
you
say
he
gave
maggie
for
it
five
pounds
mrs
ward
it
is
very
honest
of
him
to
offer
to
restore
it
to
her
ring
the
bell
dear
and
lucy
johnson
will
come
miss
johnson
was
very
much
interested
when
she
saw
the
sparkling
treasures
maggie
she
exclaimed
i
am
glad
she
has
given
them
to
you
to
take
care
of
for
her
i
was
always
terrified
at
her
keeping
such
priceless
things
in
her
drawer
ward
gave
the
girl
some
directions
and
the
necessary
money
she
went
off
to
fulfill
her
errand
in
considerable
amazement
lucy
returned
in
less
than
with
the
lovely
little
brooch
which
was
immediately
added
to
the
collection
the
best
person
to
see
these
as
you
suggested
aneta
said
ward
is
sir
charles
lysle
they
are
really
no
good
to
maggie
but
ought
to
be
sold
for
their
utmost
value
for
her
benefit
she
has
many
fine
points
and
considerable
strength
of
character
and
if
you
take
her
up
dear
i
feel
certain
that
she
will
be
saved
from
all
those
things
which
would
ruin
a
nature
like
hers
i
mean
to
take
her
up
said
aneta
with
spirit
well
said
ward
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
over
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
a
success
meanwhile
will
you
write
a
line
to
your
uncle
sir
charles
and
ask
him
if
he
can
call
here
to
see
these
treasures
yes
i
will
write
to
him
at
once
said
aneta
he
spends
most
of
his
time
at
the
british
museum
could
i
send
him
a
wire
ward
and
then
he
would
come
yes
that
is
a
very
good
idea
do
so
my
love
the
girls
had
a
very
spirited
rehearsal
and
maggie
was
her
old
vivacious
daring
clever
self
once
more
that
inward
change
which
no
doubt
had
taken
place
brought
an
added
charm
to
her
always
expressive
face
between
seven
and
eight
that
evening
aneta
uncle
sir
charles
arrived
he
and
ward
had
a
long
consultation
his
opinion
was
that
the
bracelets
and
other
curios
were
worth
at
least
seven
thousand
pounds
and
that
such
a
sum
could
easily
be
obtained
for
them
in
fact
i
myself
would
buy
them
for
that
figure
said
sir
charles
it
is
not
only
that
there
are
in
this
collection
some
unique
and
valuable
stones
but
the
history
the
setting
and
the
make
of
these
ancient
relics
would
induce
the
british
museum
to
buy
many
of
them
doubtless
however
miss
howland
will
get
the
biggest
price
of
all
for
them
if
they
are
auctioned
at
christie
before
she
went
to
bed
that
night
aneta
told
maggie
that
she
was
by
no
means
a
penniless
girl
and
that
if
she
would
consent
to
having
her
father
treasures
sold
she
would
have
sufficient
money
to
be
well
educated
and
have
a
nice
in
the
future
to
start
in
any
profession
she
fancied
oh
aneta
it
is
all
too
wonderful
said
poor
maggie
to
think
of
me
as
i
am
and
of
me
as
i
felt
last
night
when
i
wanted
to
lose
myself
in
the
london
fog
aneta
i
can
never
love
you
enough
you
want
a
good
long
sleep
she
said
think
of
and
all
the
excitement
which
lies
before
us
maggie
did
sleep
soundly
that
night
for
she
was
quite
worn
out
and
when
saturday
arrived
she
awoke
without
a
fear
and
with
a
wonderful
lightness
of
heart
the
day
of
the
festival
and
rejoining
passed
without
a
hitch
the
supper
was
delightful
the
tableaux
vivants
were
the
best
the
school
had
ever
seen
the
games
the
fun
made
the
cardews
at
least
think
that
they
had
entered
into
a
new
world
but
perhaps
the
best
scene
of
all
came
at
the
end
when
aneta
went
up
to
maggie
and
took
her
hand
and
still
holding
it
turned
and
faced
the
assembled
school
maggie
and
i
do
mean
to
be
rival
queens
any
longer
she
said
we
are
all
maggie
subjects
are
my
subjects
and
all
my
subjects
are
maggie
any
girl
who
disapproves
of
this
will
she
hold
down
her
hand
any
girl
who
approves
will
she
hold
her
hand
up
in
the
air
instantly
all
the
pairs
of
hands
were
raised
and
there
was
such
a
clapping
and
so
many
cheers
for
the
queens
who
were
no
longer
rival
queens
that
mademoiselle
was
heard
to
exclaim
but
it
is
charming
it
makes
the
heart
to
bound
i
do
love
the
english
manner
and
mademoiselle
aneta
jolie
si
and
mademoiselle
maggie
who
has
a
large
charm
i
do
make
homage
to
them
as
the
two
queens
i
would
she
continued
turning
and
clasping
miss
johnson
hands
be
a
schoolgirl
myself
to
be
a
subject
of
them
a
few
words
will
suffice
to
end
this
story
lady
lysle
might
be
proud
and
perhaps
somewhat
disdainful
but
she
was
at
least
as
good
as
her
word
and
in
a
very
short
time
martin
the
grocer
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
open
a
very
shop
in
the
west
end
this
shop
lady
lysle
took
a
curious
interest
in
and
recommended
to
her
friends
so
that
martin
began
to
do
as
sound
a
business
in
the
neighborhood
of
eaton
square
as
he
did
in
shepherd
bush
of
all
things
in
the
world
he
liked
best
to
make
money
and
he
was
quite
glad
to
be
rid
of
maggie
when
his
own
prospects
became
golden
owing
to
her
absence
from
his
premises
as
to
martin
she
was
content
to
see
her
daughter
occasionally
maggie
curios
were
all
sold
except
the
little
brooch
which
she
kept
for
herself
in
memory
of
her
father
for
a
sufficiently
large
sum
to
pay
for
her
education
and
to
leave
her
enough
money
to
do
well
for
herself
having
no
longer
anything
to
conceal
and
under
the
beautiful
brave
influence
of
aneta
she
became
quite
a
different
girl
that
strength
of
character
and
that
strange
fascination
which
were
her
special
powers
were
now
turned
into
useful
channels
maggie
could
never
be
beautiful
but
her
talents
were
above
the
average
and
her
moral
nature
now
received
every
stimulus
in
the
right
direction
merry
cardew
could
love
her
and
gain
good
not
harm
from
her
influence
but
strange
to
say
although
perhaps
not
strange
aneta
was
her
special
friend
it
was
with
aneta
that
maggie
mostly
spent
her
holidays
it
was
aneta
least
word
that
maggie
obeyed
it
was
for
aneta
approval
that
maggie
lived
queens
of
the
school
they
still
remain
each
exercising
her
influence
in
her
own
way
and
yet
both
working
in
perfect
harmony
have
they
not
both
the
characters
beautiful
said
mademoiselle
i
think
there
is
no
girl
like
the
english
girl
doubtless
she
