an
hundred
stories
in

days
told
by
seven
ladies
and
three
young
men
proem
a
kindly
thing
it
is
to
have
compassion
of
the
afflicted
and
albeit
it
well
beseemeth
every
one
yet
of
those
is
it
more
particularly
required
who
have
erst
had
need
of
comfort
and
have
found
it
in
any
amongst
whom
if
ever
any
had
need
thereof
or
held
it
dear
or
took
pleasure
therein
aforetimes
certes
i
am
one
of
these
for
that
having
from
my
first
youth
unto
this
present
been
beyond
measure
inflamed
with
a
very
high
and
noble
passion
higher
and
nobler
perchance
than
might
appear
were
i
to
relate
it
to
sort
with
my
low
estate
albeit
by
persons
of
discretion
who
had
intelligence
thereof
i
was
commended
therefor
and
accounted
so
much
the
more
worth
natheless
a
passing
sore
travail
it
was
to
me
to
bear
it
not
certes
by
reason
of
the
cruelty
of
the
beloved
lady
but
because
of
the
exceeding
ardour
begotten
in
my
breast
of
an
appetite
for
which
for
that
it
suffered
me
not
to
stand
content
at
any
reasonable
bounds
caused
me
ofttimes
feel
more
chagrin
than
i
had
occasion
for
in
this
my
affliction
the
pleasant
discourse
of
a
certain
friend
of
mine
and
his
admirable
consolations
afforded
me
such
refreshment
that
i
firmly
believe
of
these
it
came
that
i
died
not
but
as
it
pleased
him
who
being
himself
infinite
hath
for
immutable
law
appointed
unto
all
things
mundane
that
they
shall
have
an
end
my
love
beyond
every
other
fervent
and
which
nor
stress
of
reasoning
nor
counsel
no
nor
yet
manifest
shame
nor
peril
that
might
ensue
thereof

there
were
who
conceived
that

the
best
defence
against
such

danger
wherefore
making
up
their
company
they
lived
removed
from

shut
themselves
up
in
those

none
had

unto

and
that
kinsfolk
seldom
or
never
visited
one
another
and
held
no
converse
together
save
from

tribulation

stricken
such
terror

of

alike
that

reason
whereof
there
remained
unto
those
and
the
number
of

males
and

was
incalculable
who
fell
sick
none
other
succour
than
that
which
they
owed
either
to
the
charity
of
friends
and
of
these
there
were
few
or
the
greed
of
servants
who
tended
them
allured
by
high
and
extravagant
wage
albeit
for
all
this
these
latter
were
not
grown
many
and
those
men
and
women
of
mean
understanding
and
for
the
most
part
unused
to
such
offices
who
served
for
well
nigh
nought
but
to
reach
things
called
for
by
the
sick
or
to
note
when
they
died
and
in
the
doing
of
these
services
many
of
them
perished
with
their
gain
of
this
abandonment
of
the
sick
by
neighbours
kinsfolk
and
friends
and
of
the
scarcity
of
servants
arose
an
usage
before
well
nigh
unheard
to
wit
that
no
woman
how
fair
or
lovesome
or
soever
she
might
be
once
fallen
sick
recked
aught
of
having
a
man
to
tend
her
whatever
he
might
be
or
young
or
old
and
without
any
shame
discovered
to
him
every
part
of
her
body
no
otherwise
than
she
would
have
done
to
a
woman
so
but
the
necessity
of
her
sickness
required
it
the
which
belike
in
those
who
recovered
was
the
occasion
of
lesser
modesty
in
time
to
come
moreover
there
ensued
of
this
abandonment
the
death
of
many
who
peradventure
had
they
been
succoured
would
have
escaped
alive
wherefore
as
well
for
the
lack
of
the
opportune
services
which
the
sick
availed
not
to
have
as
for
the
virulence
of
the
plague
such
was
the
multitude
of
those
who
died
in
the
city
by
day
and
by
night
that
it
was
an
astonishment
to
hear
tell
thereof
much
more
to
see
it
and
thence
as
it
were
of
necessity
there
sprang
up
among
those
who
abode
alive
things
contrary
to
the
pristine
manners
of
the
townsfolk
it
was
then
even
as
we
yet
see
it
used
a
custom
that
the
kinswomen
and
of
the
dead
should
assemble
in
his
house
and
there
condole
with
those
who
more
nearly
pertained
unto
him
whilst
his
neighbours
and
many
other
citizens
foregathered
with
his
next
of
kin
before
his
house
whither
according
to
the
dead
man
quality
came
the
clergy
and
he
with
funeral
pomp
of
chants
and
candles
was
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
his
peers
to
the
church
chosen
by
himself
before
his
death
which
usages
after
the
virulence
of
the
plague
began
to
increase
were
either
altogether
or
for
the
most
part
laid
aside
and
other
and
strange
customs
sprang
up
in
their
stead
for
that
not
only
did
folk
die
without
having
a
multitude
of
women
about
them
but
many
there
were
who
departed
this
life
without
witness
and
few
indeed
were
they
to
whom
the
pious
plaints
and
bitter
tears
of
their
kinsfolk
were
vouchsafed
nay
in
lieu
of
these
things
there
obtained
for
the
most

laughter

among

wherefore
purposing
henceforth
to
leave
such
part
thereof
as
i
can
fitly
i
say
that
our
city
being
at
this
pass
well
nigh
void
of
inhabitants
it
chanced
as
i
afterward
heard
from
a
person
worthy
of
credit
that
there
foregathered
in
the
venerable
church
of
santa
maria
novella
one
tuesday
morning
when
there
was
well
nigh
none
else
there
seven
young
ladies
all
knit
one
to
another
by
friendship
or
neighbourhood
or
kinship
who
had
heard
divine
service
in
mourning
attire
as
sorted
with
such
a
season
not
one
of
them
had
passed
her
year
nor
was
less
than
eighteen
years
old
and
each
was
discreet
and
of
noble
blood
fair
of
favour
and
and
full
of
honest
sprightliness
the
names
of
these
ladies
i
would
in
proper
terms
set
out
did
not
just
cause
forbid
me
to
wit
that
i
would
not
have
it
possible
that
in
time
to
come
any
of
them
should
take
shame
by
reason
of
the
things
hereinafter
related
as
being
told
or
hearkened
by
them
the
laws
of
disport
being
nowadays
somewhat
straitened
which
at
that
time
for
the
reasons
above
shown
were
of
the
largest
not
only
for
persons
of
their
years
but
for
those
of
a
much
riper
age
nor
yet
would
i
give
occasion
to
the
envious
who
are
still
ready
to
carp
at
every
praiseworthy
life
on
anywise
to
disparage
the
fair
fame
of
these
honourable
ladies
with
unseemly
talk
wherefore
so
that
which
each
saith
may
hereafterward
be
apprehended
without
confusion
i
purpose
to
denominate
them
by
names
altogether
or
in
part
sorting
with
each
one
quality
the
first
of
them
and
her
of
ripest
age
i
shall
call
pampinea

second

i
know

no

it

dear
my

you
may
like
myself
have
many
times
heard
that
whoso
honestly
useth
his

doth
no

wrong

it
is
the
natural
right
of
every
one
who
is
born
here
below
to
succour
keep
and
defend
his
own
life
as
best
he
may
and
in
so
far
is
this
allowed
that
it
hath
happened
whiles
that
for
the
preservation
thereof
men
have
been
slain
without
any
fault

this
much
be
conceded
of
the
laws
which
have
in

the
of
all
mortals
how
much
more
is
it
lawful
for
us
and
whatsoever
other
without
offence
unto
any
to
take
such
means
as
we
may
for
the
preservation
of
our

often
as
i
consider

morning
and
those
of
many
other
mornings
past
and
bethink
me
what
and
what
manner
discourses
are
ours
i
feel
and
you
likewise
must
feel
that
each
of
us
is
in
fear
for
herself
nor
do
i
anywise
wonder
at
this
but
i
wonder
exceedingly
considering
that
we
all
have
a
woman
wit
that
we
take
no
steps
to
provide
ourselves
against
that
which
each
of
us
justly
feareth
we
abide
here
to
my
seeming
no
otherwise
than
as
if
we
would
or
should
be
witness
of
how
many
dead
bodies
are
brought
hither
for
burial
or
to
hearken
if
the
friars
of
the
place
whose
number
is
come
well
nigh
to
nought
chant
their
offices
at
the
due
hours
or
by
our
apparel
to
show
forth
unto
whosoever
appeareth
here
the
nature
and
extent
of
our
distresses
if
we
depart
hence
we
either
see
dead
bodies
or
sick
persons
carried
about
or
those
whom
for
their
misdeeds
the
authority
of
the
public
laws
whilere
condemned
to
exile
overrun
the
whole
place
with
unseemly
excesses
as
if
scoffing
at
the
laws
for
that
they
know
the
executors
thereof
to
be
either
dead
or
sick
whilst
the
dregs
of
our
city
fattened
with
our
blood
style
themselves
and
ruffle
it
everywhere
in
mockery
of
us
riding
and
running
all
about
and
flouting
us
with
our
distresses
in
ribald
songs
we
hear
nothing
here
but
an
one
is
dead
or
an
one
is
at
the
point
of
death
and
were
there
any
to
make
them
we
should
hear
dolorous
lamentations
on
all
sides
and
if
we
return
to
our
houses
i
know
not
if
it
is
with
you
as
with
me
but
for
my
part
when
i
find
none
left
therein
of
a
great
household
save
my
i
wax
fearful
and
feel
every
hair
of
my
body
stand
on
end
and
wherever
i
go
or
abide
about
the
house
meseemeth
i
see
the
shades
of
those
who
are
departed
and
who
wear
not
those
countenances
that
i
was
used
to
see
but
terrify
me
with
a
horrid
aspect
i
know
not
whence
newly
come
to
them
by
reason
of
these
things
i
feel
myself
alike
ill
at
ease
here
and
abroad
and
at
home
more
by
token
that
meseemeth
none
who
hath
as
we
have
the
power
and
whither
to
go
is
left
here
other
than
ourselves
or
if
any
such
there
be
i
have
many
a
time
both
heard
and
perceived
that
without
making
any
distinction
between
things
lawful
and
unlawful
so
but
appetite
move
them
whether
alone
or
in
company
both
day
and
night
they
do
that
which
affordeth
them
most
delight
nor
is
it
the
laity
alone
who
do
thus
nay
even
those
who
are
shut
in
the
monasteries
persuading
themselves
that
what
befitteth
and
is
lawful
to
others
alike
sortable
and
unforbidden
unto
them
have
broken
the
laws
of
obedience
and
giving
themselves
to
carnal
delights
thinking
thus
to
escape
are
grown
lewd
and
dissolute
if
thus
then
it
be
as
is
manifestly
to
be
seen
what
do
we
here
what
look
we
for
what
dream
we
why
are
we
more
sluggish
and
slower
to
provide
for
our
safety
than
all
the
rest
of
the
townsfolk
deem
we
ourselves
of
less
price
than
others
or
do
we
hold
our
life
to
be
bounden
in
our
bodies
with
a
stronger
chain
than
is
theirs
and
that
therefore
we
need
reck
nothing
of
aught
that
hath
power
to
harm
it
we
err
we
are
deceived
what
folly
is
ours
if
we
think
thus
as
often
as
we
choose
to
call
to
mind
the
number
and
quality
of
the
youths
and
ladies
overborne
of
this
cruel
pestilence
we
may
see
a
most
manifest
proof
thereof
footnote
this
phrase
may
also
be
read
persuading
themselves
that
that
their
breach
of
the
laws
of
obedience
etc
beseemeth
them
and
is
forbidden
only
to
others

che
quello

the
reading
in
the
text
appears
more
in
harmony
with
the
general
sense

is
indeed
indicated
by
the
punctuation
of
the
giunta
edition
of
which
i
generally
follow
in
case
of
doubt
wherefore
in
order
that
we
may
not
through
wilfulness

nonchalance
fall
into
that

by
some
means
or
other
escape
i
know
not
if
it
seem
to
you
as
it
doth
to
me
but
methinketh
it
were
excellently
well
done
that
we
such
as
we
are
depart
this
city
as
many
have
done
before
us
and
eschewing
as
we
would
death
the
dishonourable
example
of
others
betake
ourselves
quietly
to
our
places
in
the
country
whereof
each
of
us
hath
great
plenty
and
there
take
such
diversion
such
delight
and
such
pleasance
as
we
may
without
anywise
overpassing
the
bounds
of
reason
there
may
we
hear
the
small
birds
sing
there
may
we
see
the
hills
and
plains
clad
all
in
green
and
the
fields
full
of
corn
wave
even
as
doth
the
sea
there
may
we
see
trees
a
thousand
sorts
and
there
is
the
face
of
heaven
more
open
to
view
the
which
angered
against
us
though
it
be
nevertheless
denieth
not
unto
us
its
eternal
beauties
far
goodlier
to
look
upon
than
the
empty
walls
of
our
city
moreover
there
is
the
air
far
fresher
and
there
at
this
season
is
more
plenty
of
that
which
behoveth
unto
life
and
less
is
the
sum
of
annoys
for
that
albeit
the
husbandmen
die
there
even
as
do
the
townsfolk
here
the
displeasance
is
there
the
less
insomuch
as
houses
and
inhabitants
are
rarer
than
in
the
city
footnote
syn
cooler
here
on
the
other
hand
if
i
deem
aright
we
abandon
no
one
nay
we
may
far
rather
say
with
truth
that
we
ourselves
are
abandoned
seeing
that
our
kinsfolk
either
dying
or
fleeing
from
death
have
left
us
alone
in
this
great
tribulation
as
it
were
we
pertained
not
unto
them
no
blame
can
therefore
befall
the
ensuing
of
this
counsel
nay
dolour
and
chagrin
and
belike
death
may
betide
us
an
we
ensue
it
not
wherefore
an
it
please
you
methinketh
we
should
do
well
to
take
our
maids
and
letting
follow
after
us
with
the
necessary
gear
sojourn
in
this
place
and
in
that
taking
such
pleasance
and
diversion
as
the
season
may
afford
and
on
this
wise
abide
till
such
time
an
we
be
not
earlier
overtaken
of
death
as
we
shall
see
what
issue
heaven
reserveth
unto
these
things
and
i
would
remind
you
that
it
is
no
more
forbidden
unto
us
honourably
to
depart
than
it
is
unto
many
others
of
our
sex
to
abide
in
dishonour
the
other
ladies
having
hearkened
to
pampinea
not
only
commended
her
counsel
but
eager
to
follow
it
had
already
begun
to
devise
more
particularly
among
themselves
of
the
manner
as
if
arising
from
their
session
there
they
were
to
set
off
out
of
hand
but
filomena
who
was
exceeding
discreet
said
ladies
albeit
that
which
pampinea
allegeth
is
excellently
well
said
yet
is
there
no
occasion
for
running
as
meseemeth
you
would
do
remember
that
we
are
all
women
and
none
of
us
is
child
enough
not
to
know
how
little
reasonable
women
are
among
themselves
and
how
ill
without
some
man
guidance
they
know
how
to
order
themselves
we
are
fickle
wilful
suspicious
and
timorous
for
which
reasons
i
misdoubt
me
sore
an
we
take
not
some
other
guidance
than
our
own
that
our
company
will
be
far
too
soon
dissolved
and
with
less
honour
to
ourselves
than
were
seemly
wherefore
we
should
do
well
to
provide
ourselves
ere
we
begin
verily
answered
elisa
men
are
the
head
of
women
and
without
their
ordinance
seldom
cometh
any
emprise
of
ours
to
good
end
but
how
may
we
come
by
these
men
there
is
none
of
us
but
knoweth
that
of
her
kinsmen
the
most
part
are
dead
and
those
who
abide
alive
are
all
gone
fleeing
that
which
we
seek
to
flee
in
divers
companies
some
here
and
some
there
without
our
knowing
where
and
to
invite
strangers
would
not
be
seemly
seeing
that
if
we
would
endeavour
after
our
welfare
it
behoveth
us
find
a
means
of
so
ordering
ourselves
that
wherever
we
go
for
diversion
and
repose
scandal
nor
annoy
may
ensue
thereof
whilst
such
discourse
was
toward
between
the
ladies
behold
there
entered
the
church
three
young
men
yet
not
so
young
that
the
age
of
the
youngest
of
them
was
less
than
years
in
whom
neither
the
perversity
of
the
time
nor
loss
of
friends
and
kinsfolk
no
nor
fear
for
themselves
had
availed
to
cool
much
less
to
quench
the
fire
of
love
of
these
one
was
called
pamfilo
another
filostrato
and
the
third
dioneo
all
very
agreeable
and
and
they
went
seeking
for
their
supreme
solace
in
such
a
perturbation
of
things
to
see
their
mistresses
who
as
it
chanced
were
all
three
among
the
seven
aforesaid
whilst
certain
of
the
other
ladies
were
near
kinswomen
of
one
or
other
of
the
young
men

seeing
that
the
lady
spoke
in
good
earnest
they
made
answer
joyfully
that
they
were
ready

without
losing

straying
with

young

together
about

themselves

weaving
goodly
garlands

there
the

with
the

seemed

everything
covered
with

having
washed
their

they
all
by

seated
themselves
according
to

came

delicately
drest

choicest
wines
were
proffered
and
the

quietly
tended

these
things

that
they
were

joyously
and
with

of
merry
talk
and
the
tables
being
cleared
away
the
queen
bade
bring
instruments
of
music
for
that
all
the
ladies
knew
how
to
dance
as
also
the
young
men
and
some
of
them
could
both
play

sing
excellent
well
accordingly
by
her
commandment

took
a
lute
and
fiammetta
a

began
softly
to
sound
a
dance
whereupon
the
queen
and
the
other
ladies
together
with
the
other
two
young
men
having
sent
the
to
eat
struck
up
a
round
and
began
with
a
slow
pace
to
dance

brawl
which
ended
they
fell
to
singing
quaint
and
merry
ditties
on
this
wise
they
abode
till
it
seemed
to
the
queen
time
to
go
to
sleep
and
she
accordingly
dismissed
them
all
whereupon
the
young
men
retired
to
their
chambers

were
withdrawn
from
the
ladies
lodging
and
finding
them
with
the
beds
well
made
and
as
full
of

as
the

put
off

betook

on

the
three
young
men
alleging
overmuch
sleep
to
be
harmful

and
so
they
betook
themselves
to
a
little
meadow

the

grew
green

as

my
counsel

followed
in

shall
pass
away
this
sultry
part
of
the
day
not
in
gaming
wherein
the
mind
of
one
of
the
players
must
of
necessity
be
troubled
without
any
great
pleasure
of
the
other
or
of
those
who
look
on
but
in
telling
stories
which
one
telling
may
afford
diversion
to
all
the
company
who
hearken
nor
shall
we
have
made
an
end
of
telling
each
his
story
but
the
sun
will
have
declined
and
the
heat
be
abated
and
we
can
then
go
whereas
it
may
be
most
agreeable
to
us
wherefore
if
this
that
i
say
please
you
for
i
am
disposed
to
follow
your
pleasure
therein
let
us
do
it
and
if
it
please
you
not
let
each
until
the
hour
of

do
what
most

patron
procuration
and
letters
commendatory
from
the
king
betook
himself
into
burgundy
where
well
nigh
none
knew
him
and
there
contrary
to
his
nature
began
courteously
and
blandly
to
seek
to
get
in
his
payments
and
do
that
wherefor
he
was
come
thither
as
if
reserving
choler
and
violence
for
a
last
resort
dealing
thus
and
lodging
in
the
house
of
two
florentines
brothers
who
there
lent
at
usance
and
who
entertained
him
with
great
honour
for
the
love
of
messer
musciatto
it
chanced
that
he
fell
sick
whereupon
the
two
brothers
promptly
fetched
physicians
and
servants
to
tend
him
and
furnished
him
with
all
that
behoved
unto
the
recovery
of
his
health
but
every
succour
was
in
vain
for
that
by
the
physicians
report
the
good
man
who
was
now
old
and
had
lived
disorderly
grew
daily
worse
as
one
who
had
a
mortal
sickness
wherefore
the
two
brothers
were
sore
concerned
and
one
day
being
pretty
near
the
chamber
where
he
lay
sick
they
began
to
take
counsel
together
saying
one
to
the
other
shall
we
do
with
yonder
fellow
we
have
a
sorry
bargain
on
our
hands
of
his
affair
for
that
to
send
him
forth
of
our
house
thus
sick
were
a
sore
reproach
to
us
and
a
manifest
sign
of
little
wit
on
our
part
if
the
folk
who
have
seen
us
first
receive
him
and
after
let
tend
and
medicine
him
with
such
solicitude
should
now
see
him
suddenly
put
out
of
our
house
sick
unto
death
as
he
is
without
it
being
possible
for
him
to
have
done
aught
that
should
displease
us
on
the
other
hand
he
hath
been
so
wicked
a
man
that
he
will
never
consent
to
confess
or
take
any
sacrament
of
the
church
and
he
dying
without
confession
no
church
will
receive
his
body
nay
he
will
be
cast
into
a
ditch
like
a
dog
again
even
if
he
do
confess
his
sins
are
so
many
and
so
horrible
that
the
like
will
come
of
it
for
that
there
is
nor
priest
nor
friar
who
can
or
will
absolve
him
thereof
wherefore
being
unshriven
he
will
still
be
cast
into
the
ditches
should
it
happen
thus
the
people
of
the
city
as
well
on
account
of
our
trade
which
appeareth
to
them
most
iniquitous
and
of
which
they
missay
all
day
as
of
their
itch
to
plunder
us
seeing
this
will
rise
up
in
riot
and
cry
out
these
lombard
dogs
whom
the
church
refuseth
to
receive
are
to
be
suffered
here
no
longer
and
they
will
run
to
our
houses
and
despoil
us
not
only
of
our
good
but
may
be
of
our
lives
to
boot
wherefore
in
any
case
it
will
go
ill
with
us
if
yonder
fellow
die
master
ciappelletto
who
as
we
have
said
lay
near
the
place
where
the
two
brothers
were
in
discourse
being
quick
of
hearing
as
is
most
times
the
case
with
the
sick
heard
what
they
said
of
him
and
calling
them
to
him
bespoke
them
thus
will
not
have
you
anywise
misdoubt
of
me
nor
fear
to
take
any
hurt
by
me
i
have
heard
what
you
say
of
me
and
am
well
assured
that
it
would
happen
even
as
you
say
should
matters
pass
as
you
expect
but
it
shall
go
otherwise
i
have
in
my
lifetime
done
god
the
lord
so
many
an
affront
that
it
will
make
neither
more
nor
less
an
i
do
him
yet
another
at
the
point
of
death
wherefore
do
you
make
shift
to
bring
me
the
holiest
and
worthiest
friar
you
may
avail
to
have
if
any
such
there
be
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
for
that
i
will
assuredly
order
your
affairs
and
mine
own
on
such
wise
that
all
shall
go
well
and
you
shall
have
good
cause
to
be
satisfied
footnote
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
holy
and
worthy
friar
the
two
brothers
albeit
they
conceived
no
great
hope
of
this
nevertheless
betook
themselves
to
a
brotherhood
of
monks
and
demanded
some
holy
and
learned
man
to
hear
the
confession
of
a
lombard
who
lay
sick
in
their
house
there
was
given
them
a
venerable
brother
of
holy
and
good
life
and
a
past
master
in
holy
writ
a
very
reverend
man
for
whom
all
the
townsfolk
had
a
very
great
and
special
regard
and
they
carried
him
to
their
house
where
coming
to
the
chamber
where
master
ciappelletto
lay
and
seating
himself
by
his
side
he
began
first
tenderly
to
comfort
him
and
after
asked
him
how
long
it
was
since
he
had
confessed
last
whereto
master
ciappelletto
who
had
never
confessed
in
his
life
answered
it
hath
been
my
usance
to
confess
every
week
once
at
the
least
and
often
more
it
is
true
that
since
i
fell
sick
to
wit
these
eight
days
past
i
have
not
confessed
such
is
the
annoy
that
my
sickness
hath
given
me
quoth
the
friar
son
thou
hast
done
well
and
so
must
thou
do
henceforward
i
see
since
thou
confessest
so
often
that
i
shall
be
at
little
pains
either
of
hearing
or
questioning
answered
master
ciappelletto
not
so
i
have
never
confessed
so
much
nor
so
often
but
i
would
still
fain
make
a
general
confession
of
all
my
sins
that
i
could
call
to
mind
from
the
day
of
my
birth
to
that
of
my
confession
wherefore
i
pray
you
good
my
father
question
me
as
punctually
of
everything
nay
everything
as
if
i
had
never
confessed
and
consider
me
not
because
i
am
sick
for
that
i
had
far
liefer
displease
this
my
flesh
than
in
consulting
its
ease
do
aught
that
might
be
the
perdition
of
my
soul
which
my
saviour
redeemed
with
his
precious
blood
these
words
much
pleased
the
holy
man
and
seemed
to
him
to
argue
a
mind
wherefore
after
he
had
much
commended
master
ciappelletto
for
that
his
usance
he
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
sinned
by
way
of
lust
with
any
woman
replied
master
ciappelletto
sighing
this
point
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
you
the
truth
fearing
to
sin
by
way
of
vainglory
quoth
the
friar
in
all
security
for
never
did
one
sin
by
telling
the
truth
whether
in
confession
or
otherwise
said
master
ciappelletto
you
certify
me
of
this
i
will
tell
you
i
am
yet
a
virgin
even
as
i
came
forth
of
my
mother
body
blessed
be
thou
of
god
cried
the
monk
well
hast
thou
done
and
doing
thus
thou
hast
the
more
deserved
inasmuch
as
an
thou
wouldst
thou
hadst
more
leisure
to
do
the
contrary
than
we
and
whatsoever
others
are
limited
by
any
rule
after
this
he
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
offended
against
god
in
the
sin
of
gluttony
whereto
master
ciappelletto
answered
sighing
ay
had
he
and
that
many
a
time
for
that
albeit
over
and
above
the
lenten
fasts
that
are
yearly
observed
of
the
devout
he
had
been
wont
to
fast
on
bread
and
water
three
days
at
the
least
in
every
week
he
had
oftentimes
and
especially
whenas
he
had
endured
any
fatigue
either
praying
or
going
drunken
the
water
with
as
much
appetite
and
as
keen
a
relish
as
great
drinkers
do
wine
and
many
a
time
he
had
longed
to
have
such
homely
salads
of
potherbs
as
women
make
when
they
go
into
the
country
and
whiles
eating
had
given
him
more
pleasure
than
himseemed
it
should
do
to
one
who
fasteth
for
devotion
as
did
he
son
said
the
friar
sins
are
natural
and
very
slight
and
i
would
not
therefore
have
thee
burden
thy
conscience
withal
more
than
behoveth
it
happeneth
to
every
man
how
devout
soever
he
be
that
after
long
fasting
meat
seemeth
good
to
him
and
after
travail
drink
father
mine
rejoined
ciappelletto
me
not
this
to
comfort
me
you
must
know
i
know
that
things
done
for
the
service
of
god
should
be
done
sincerely
and
with
an
ungrudging
mind
and
whoso
doth
otherwise
sinneth
quoth
the
friar
exceeding
well
pleased
am
content
that
thou
shouldst
thus
apprehend
it
and
thy
pure
and
good
conscience
therein
pleaseth
me
exceedingly
but
tell
me
hast
thou
sinned
by
way
of
avarice
desiring
more
than
befitted
or
withholding
that
which
it
behoved
thee
not
to
withhold
mine
replied
ciappelletto
would
not
have
you
look
to
my
being
in
the
house
of
these
usurers
i
have
nought
to
do
here
nay
i
came
hither
to
admonish
and
chasten
them
and
turn
them
from
this
their
abominable
way
of
gain
and
methinketh
i
should
have
made
shift
to
do
so
had
not
god
thus
visited
me
but
you
must
know
that
i
was
left
a
rich
man
by
my
father
of
whose
good
when
he
was
dead
i
bestowed
the
most
part
in
alms
and
after
to
sustain
my
life
and
that
i
might
be
able
to
succour
christ
poor
i
have
done
my
little
traffickings
and
in
these
i
have
desired
to
gain
but
still
with
god
poor
have
i
shared
that
which
i
gained
converting
my
own
half
to
my
occasion
and
giving
them
the
other
and
in
this
so
well
hath
my
creator
prospered
me
that
my
affairs
have
still
gone
from
good
to
better
hast
thou
done
said
the
friar
hast
thou
often
been
angered
cried
master
ciappelletto
i
must
tell
you
i
have
very
often
been
and
who
could
keep
himself
therefrom
seeing
men
do
unseemly
things
all
day
long
keeping
not
the
commandments
of
god
neither
fearing
his
judgment
many
times
a
day
i
had
liefer
been
dead
than
alive
seeing
young
men
follow
after
vanities
and
hearing
them
curse
and
forswear
themselves
haunting
the
taverns
visiting
not
the
churches
and
ensuing
rather
the
ways
of
the
world
than
that
of
god
son
said
the
friar
is
a
righteous
anger
nor
for
my
part
might
i
enjoin
thee
any
penance
therefor
but
hath
anger
at
any
time
availed
to
move
thee
to
do
any
manslaughter
or
to
bespeak
any
one
unseemly
or
do
any
other
unright
sir
answered
the
sick
man
who
seem
to
me
a
man
of
god
how
can
you
say
such
words
had
i
ever
had
the
least
thought
of
doing
any
one
of
the
things
whereof
you
speak
think
you
i
believe
that
god
would
so
long
have
forborne
me
these
be
the
doings
of
outlaws
and
men
of
nought
whereof
i
never
saw
any
but
i
said
still
go
may
god
amend
thee
then
said
the
friar
tell
me
my
son
blessed
be
thou
of
god
hast
thou
never
borne
false
witness
against
any
or
missaid
of
another
or
taken
others
good
without
leave
of
him
to
whom
it
pertained
indeed
sir
replied
master
ciappelletto
have
missaid
of
others
for
that
i
had
a
neighbour
aforetime
who
with
the
greatest
unright
in
the
world
did
nought
but
beat
his
wife
insomuch
that
i
once
spoke
ill
of
him
to
her
kinsfolk
so
great
was
the
compassion
that
overcame
me
for
the
poor
woman
whom
he
used
as
god
alone
can
tell
whenassoever
he
had
drunken
overmuch
quoth
the
friar
tellest
me
thou
hast
been
a
merchant
hast
thou
never
cheated
any
one
as
merchants
do
whiles
faith
yes
sir
answered
master
ciappelletto
i
know
not
whom
except
it
were
a
certain
man
who
once
brought
me
monies
which
he
owed
me
for
cloth
i
had
sold
him
and
which
i
threw
into
a
chest
without
counting
a
good
month
after
i
found
that
they
were
four
farthings
more
than
they
should
have
been
wherefore
not
seeing
him
again
and
having
kept
them
by
me
a
full
year
that
i
might
restore
them
to
him
i
gave
them
away
in
alms
quoth
the
friar
was
a
small
matter
and
thou
didst
well
to
deal
with
it
as
thou
didst
then
he
questioned
him
of
many
other
things
of
all
which
he
answered
after
the
same
fashion
and
the
holy
father
offering
to
proceed
to
absolution
master
ciappelletto
said
i
have
yet
sundry
sins
that
i
have
not
told
you
the
friar
asked
him
what
they
were
and
he
answered
mind
me
that
one
saturday
after
none
i
caused
my
servant
sweep
out
the
house
and
had
not
that
reverence
for
the
holy
day
which
it
behoved
me
have
said
the
friar
is
a
light
matter
my
son
rejoined
master
ciappelletto
it
not
a
light
matter
for
that
the
lord
day
is
greatly
to
be
honoured
seeing
that
on
such
a
day
our
lord
rose
from
the
dead
then
said
the
friar
hast
thou
done
aught
else
sir
answered
master
ciappelletto
unthinking
what
i
did
i
spat
in
the
church
of
god
thereupon
the
friar
fell
and
said
son
that
is
no
thing
to
be
recked
of
we
who
are
of
the
clergy
we
spit
there
all
day
long
you
do
very
ill
rejoined
master
ciappelletto
that
there
is
nought
which
it
so
straitly
behoveth
to
keep
clean
as
the
holy
temple
wherein
is
rendered
sacrifice
to
god
brief
he
told
him
great
plenty
of
such
like
things
and
presently
fell
and
after
weeping
sore
as
he
knew
full
well
to
do
whenas
he
would
quoth
the
holy
friar
aileth
thee
my
son
sir
replied
master
ciappelletto
have
one
sin
left
whereof
i
never
yet
confessed
me
such
shame
have
i
to
tell
it
and
every
time
i
call
it
to
mind
i
weep
even
as
you
see
and
meseemeth
very
certain
that
god
will
never
pardon
it
me
to
son
rejoined
the
friar
is
this
thou
sayest
if
all
the
sins
that
were
ever
wrought
or
are
yet
to
be
wrought
of
all
mankind
what
while
the
world
endureth
were
all
in
one
man
and
he
repented
him
thereof
and
were
contrite
therefor
as
i
see
thee
such
is
the
mercy
and
of
god
that
upon
confession
he
would
freely
pardon
them
to
him
wherefore
do
thou
tell
it
in
all
assurance
quoth
master
ciappelletto
still
weeping
sore
father
mine
mine
is
too
great
a
sin
and
i
can
scarce
believe
that
it
will
ever
be
forgiven
me
of
god
except
your
prayers
strive
for
me
then
said
the
friar
it
me
in
all
assurance
for
i
promise
thee
to
pray
god
for
thee
master
ciappelletto
however
still
wept
and
said
nought
but
after
he
had
thus
held
the
friar
a
great
while
in
suspense
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
mine
since
you
promise
me
to
pray
god
for
me
i
will
tell
it
you
know
then
that
when
i
was
little
i
once
cursed
my
mother
so
saying
he
fell
again
to
weeping
sore
my
son
quoth
the
friar
this
to
thee
so
heinous
a
sin
why
men
blaspheme
god
all
day
long
and
he
freely
pardoneth
whoso
repenteth
him
of
having
blasphemed
him
and
deemest
thou
not
he
will
pardon
thee
this
weep
not
but
comfort
thyself
for
certes
wert
thou
one
of
those
who
set
him
on
the
cross
he
would
pardon
thee
in
favour
of
such
contrition
as
i
see
in
thee
father
mine
what
say
you
replied
ciappelletto
kind
mother
who
bore
me
nine
months
in
her
body
day
and
night
and
carried
me
on
her
neck
an
hundred
times
and
more
i
did
passing
ill
to
curse
her
and
it
was
an
exceeding
great
sin
and
except
you
pray
god
for
me
it
will
not
be
forgiven
me
the
friar
then
seeing
that
master
ciappelletto
had
no
more
to
say
gave
him
absolution
and
bestowed
on
him
his
benison
holding
him
a
very
holy
man
and
devoutly
believing
all
that
he
had
told
him
to
be
true
and
who
would
not
have
believed
it
hearing
a
man
at
the
point
of
death
speak
thus
then
after
all
this
he
said
to
him
ciappelletto
with
god
help
you
will
speedily
be
whole
but
should

it
please
you

master

you
have

wherefore
i
pray
you
that
whenas
you
return
to
your

you
must
cause
bring
me
that
most
veritable
body
of
christ
which
you
consecrate
upon
the
altar
for
that
with
your
leave
i
purpose
all
unworthy
as
i
am
to
take
it
and
after
holy
and
extreme
unction
to
the
intent
that
if
i
have
lived
as
a
sinner
i
may
at
the
least
die
like
a
christian
the
good
friar
replied
that
it
pleased
him
much
and
that
he
said
well
and
promised
to
see
it
presently
brought
him
and
so
was
it
done
meanwhile
the
two
brothers
misdoubting
them
sore
lest
master
ciappelletto
should
play
them
false
had
posted
themselves
behind
a
wainscot
that
divided
the
chamber
where
he
lay
from
another
and
listening
easily
heard
and
apprehended
that
which
he
said
to
the
friar
and
had
whiles
so
great
a
mind
to
laugh
hearing
the
things
which
he
confessed
to
having
done
that
they
were
like
to
burst
and
said
one
to
other

of
man

this
whom
neither
old
age
nor
sickness
nor

of

whereunto
he
seeth
himself

yet

whose
he
looketh
to
be

long
have
availed
to
turn
from
his
wickedness
nor
hinder
him
from
choosing
to
die
as
he
hath
lived
however
seeing
that
he
had
so
spoken
that
he
should
be
admitted
to
burial
in
a
church
they
recked
nought
of
the
rest
master
ciappelletto
presently
took
the
sacrament
and
growing
rapidly
worse
received
extreme
unction
and
a
little
after
evensong
of
the
day
he
had
made
his
fine
confession
he
died
whereupon
the
two
brothers
having
of
his
proper
monies
taken
order
for
his
honourable
burial
sent
to
the
convent
to
acquaint
the
friars
therewith
bidding
them
come
thither
that
night
to
hold
vigil
according
to
usance
and
fetch
away
the
body
in
the
morning
and
meanwhile
made
ready
all
that
was
needful
thereunto
the
holy
friar
who
had
shriven
him
hearing
that
he
had
departed
this
life
betook
himself
to
the
prior
of
the
convent
and
letting
ring
to
chapter
gave
out
to
the
brethren
therein
assembled
that
master
ciappelletto
had
been
a
holy
man
according
to
that
which
he
had
gathered
from
his
confession
and
persuaded
them
to
receive
his
body
with
the
utmost
reverence
and
devotion
in
the
hope
that
god
should
show
forth
many
miracles
through
him
to
this
the
prior
and
brethren
credulously
consented
and
that
same
evening
coming
all
whereas
master
ciappelletto
lay
dead
they
held
high
and
solemn
vigil
over
him
and
on
the
morrow
clad
all
in
albs
and
copes
book
in
hand
and
crosses
before
them
they
went
chanting
the
while
for
his
body
and
brought
it
with
the
utmost
pomp
and
solemnity
to
their
church
followed
by
well
nigh
all
the
people
of
the
city
men
and
women
as
soon
as
they
had
set
the
body
down
in
the
church
the
holy
friar
who
had
confessed
him

the
pulpit
and
fell
marvellous
things
of
the
dead
man
and
of
his
life
his
fasts
his
virginity
his
simplicity
and
innocence
and
sanctity
recounting
amongst
other
things
that
which
he
had
confessed
to
him
as
his
greatest
sin
and
how
he
had
hardly
availed
to
persuade
him
that
god
would
forgive
it
him
thence
passing
on
to
reprove
the
folk
who
hearkened

stirreth
between

and

and
all
the

moreover
he
told
them
many
other
things

his
loyalty
and
purity
of
heart
brief
with
his
speech
whereto
entire
faith
was
yielded
of
the
people
of

city
he
so
established
the
dead
man
in
the
reverent
consideration
of
all
who
were
present
that
no
sooner
was
the
service
at
an
end
than
they
all
with
the
utmost
eagerness
flocked
to
kiss
his
hands
and
feet
and
the
clothes
were
torn
off
his
back
he
holding
himself
blessed
who
might
avail
to
have
never
so
little
thereof
and
needs
must
they
leave
him
thus
all
that
day
so
he
might
be
seen
and
visited
of
all
the
following
night
he
was
honourably
buried
in
a
marble
tomb
in
one
of
the
chapels
of
the
church
and
on
the
morrow
the
folk
began
incontinent
to
come
and
burn
candles
and
offer
up
prayers
and
make
vows
to
him
and
hang
images
of
wax
at
his
shrine
according
to
the
promise
made
nay
on
such

waxed

there
was
scarce
any

being
in

him

him

wrought

thus
then

became
a

as
you
have
heard
nor

i
deny
it
to
be
possible
that
he
is
beatified
in
god
presence
for
that

his
life
was
wicked

perverse
he
may
at

have
shown
such
contrition

him

is

that

of

benignness
as
i
have
heard
tell
gracious
ladies
there
was
once
in
paris
a
great
merchant
and
a
very
loyal
and
upright
man
whose
name
was
jehannot
de
chevign√©
and
who
was
of
great
traffic
in
silks
and
stuffs
he
had
particular
friendship
for
a
very
rich
jew
called
abraham
who
was
also
a
merchant
and
a
very
honest
and
trusty
man
and
seeing
the
worth
and
loyalty
it
began
to
irk
him
sore
that
the
soul
of
so
worthy
and
discreet
and
good
a
man
should
go
to
perdition
for
default
of
faith
wherefore
he
fell
to
beseeching
him
on
friendly
wise
leave
the
errors
of
the
jewish
faith
and
turn
to
the
christian
verity
which
he
might
see
still
wax
and
prosper
as
being
holy
and
good
whereas
his
own
faith
on
the
contrary
was
manifestly
on
the
wane
and
dwindling
to
nought
the
jew
made
answer
that
he
held
no
faith
holy
or
good
save
only
the
jewish
that
in
this
latter
he
was
born
and
therein
meant
to
live
and
die
nor
should
aught
ever
make
him
remove
therefrom
jehannot
for
all
that
desisted
not
from
him
but
some
days
after
returned
to
the
attack
with
similar
words
showing
him
on
rude
enough
wise
for
that
merchants
for
the
most
part
can
no
better
for
what
reasons
our
religion
is
better
than
the
jewish
and
albeit
the
jew
was
a
past
master
in
their
law
nevertheless
whether
it
was
the
great
friendship
he
bore
jehannot
that
moved
him
or
peradventure
words
wrought
it
that
the
holy
ghost
put
into
the
good
simple
man
mouth
the
latter
arguments
began
greatly
to
please
him
but
yet
persisting
in
his
own
belief
he
would
not
suffer
himself
to
be
converted
like
as
he
abode
obstinate
even
so
jehannot
never
gave
over
importuning
him
till
at
last
the
jew
overcome
by
such
continual
insistence
said
you
jehannot
thou
wouldst
have
me
become
a
christian
and
i
am
disposed
to
do
it
insomuch
indeed
that
i
mean
in
the
first
place
to
go
to
rome

there
see
him
who
thou
sayest

vicar
upon

and
consider
his
manners
and

and
likewise
those
of
his

these
appear
to
me
such

i
may
by

apprehend

is

mine

thou
hast
studied

when
jehannot
heard

had
right

were
he
already
a

would

turning

him
my

undertake

travail

so
great
a

as
it
will
be
to
thee

go

both
by

is
full

learned

than
are
here

better

thee

that
which
thou
wilt

to
my

superfluous

thee
that

those
thou
mayst

as

an
thou
wilt
be
counselled

reserve
this

unto
another

assured
that
he
would
never

once
he
should
have
seen

availing
nothing

this
is
probably
some
copyist
mistake
for
the
old
form
of
availing
the
jew
mounted
to
horse
and
as
quickliest
he
might
betook
himself
to
the
court
of
rome
he
was
honourably
entertained
of
his
brethren
and
there
abiding
without
telling
any
the
reason
of
his
coming
he
began
diligently
to
enquire
into
the
manners
and
fashions
of
the
pope
and
cardinals
and
other
prelates
and
of
all
the
members
of
his
court
and
what
with
that
which
he
himself
noted
being
a
mighty
man
and
that
which
he
gathered
from
others
he
found
all
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
most
shamefully
given
to
the
sin
of
lust
and
that
not
only
in
the
way
of
nature
but
after
the
sodomitical
fashion
without
any
restraint
of
remorse
or
shamefastness
insomuch
that
the
interest
of
courtezans
and
catamites
was
of
no
small
avail
there
in
obtaining
any
considerable
thing
moreover
he
manifestly
perceived
them
to
be
universally
gluttons
drunkards
and
slaves
to
their
bellies
fashion
more
than
to
aught
else
after
lust
and
looking
farther
he
saw
them
all
covetous
and
greedy
after
money
insomuch
that
human
nay
christian
blood
no
less
than
things
sacred
whatsoever
they
might
be
whether
pertaining
to
the
sacrifices
of
the
altar
or
to
the
benefices
of
the
church
they
sold
and
bought
indifferently
for
a
price
making
a
greater
traffic
and
having
more
brokers
thereof
than
folk
at
paris
of
silks
and
stuffs
or
what
not
else
manifest
simony
they
had
christened
and
gluttony
as
if
god
apprehended
not
let
be
the
meaning
of
words
but
the
intention
of
depraved
minds
and
would
suffer
himself
after
the
fashion
of
men
to
be
duped
by
the
names
of
things
all
this
together
with
much
else
which
must
be
left
unsaid
was
supremely
displeasing
to
the
jew
who
was
a
sober
and
modest
man
and
himseeming
he
had
seen
enough
he
determined
to
return
to
paris
and
did
so
as
soon
as
jehannot
knew
of
his
return
he
betook
himself
to
him
hoping
nothing
less
than
that
he
should
become
a
christian
and
they
greeted
each
other
with
the
utmost
joy
then
after
abraham
had
rested
some
days
jehannot
asked
him
how
himseemed
of
the
holy
father
and
of
the
cardinals
and
others
of
his
court
whereto
the
jew
promptly
answered
god
give
them
ill
one
and
all
and
i
say
this
for
that
if
i
was
able
to
observe
aright

piety
no
devoutness
no
good
work
or

and
banish
from

the

hearing

proceeded

addressing
the
female
part
of
the
company
saladin
whose
valour
was
such
that
not
only
from
a
man
of
little
account
it
made
him
soldan
of
babylon
but
gained
him
many
victories
over
kings
saracen
and
christian
having
in
divers
wars
and
in
the
exercise
of
his
extraordinary
munificences
expended
his
whole
treasure
and
having
an
urgent
occasion
for
a
good
sum
of
money
nor
seeing
whence
he
might
avail
to
have
it
as
promptly
as
it
behoved
him
called
to
mind
a
rich
jew
by
name
melchizedek
who
lent
at
usance
in
alexandria
and
bethought
himself
that
this
latter
had
the
wherewithal
to
oblige
him
and
he
would
but
he
was
so
miserly
that
he
would
never
have
done
it
of
his
freewill
and
saladin
was
loath
to
use
force
with
him
wherefore
need
constraining
him
he
set
his
every
wit
awork
to
find
a
means
how
the
jew
might
be
brought
to
serve
him
in
this
and
presently
concluded
to
do
him
a
violence
coloured
by
some
show
of
reason
accordingly
he
sent
for
melchizedek
and
receiving
him
familiarly
seated
him
by
himself
then
said
to
him
man
i
have
understood
from
divers
persons
that
thou
art
a
very
learned
man
and
deeply
versed
in
matters
of
divinity
wherefore
i
would
fain
know
of
thee
whether
of
the
three
laws
thou
reputest
the
true
the
jewish
the
saracen
or
the
christian
the
jew
who
was
in
truth
a
man
of
learning
and
understanding
perceived
but
too
well
that
saladin
looked
to
entrap
him
in
words
so
he
might
fasten
a
quarrel
on
him
and
bethought
himself
that
he
could
not
praise
any
of
the
three
more
than
the
others
without
giving
him
the
occasion
he
sought
accordingly
sharpening
his
wits
as
became
one
who
felt
himself
in
need
of
an
answer
by
which
he
might
not
be
taken
at
a
vantage
there
speedily
occurred
to
him
that
which
it
behoved
him
reply
and
he
said
lord
the
question
that
you
propound
to
me
is
a
nice
one
and
to
acquaint
you
with
that
which
i
think
of
the
matter
it
behoveth
me
tell
you
a
little
story
which
you
shall
hear
an
i
mistake
not
i
mind
me
to
have
many
a
time
heard
tell
that
there
was
once
a
great
man
and
a
rich
who
among
other
very
precious
jewels
in
his
treasury
had
a
very
goodly
and
costly
ring
whereunto
being
minded
for
its
worth
and
beauty
to
do
honour
and
wishing
to
leave
it
in
perpetuity
to
his
descendants
he
declared
that
whichsoever
of
his
sons
should
at
his
death
be
found
in
possession
thereof
by
his
bequest
unto
him
should
be
recognized
as
his
heir
and
be
held
of
all
the
others
in
honour
and
reverence
as
chief
and
head
he
to
whom
the
ring
was
left
by
him
held
a
like
course
with
his
own
descendants
and
did
even
as
his
father
had
done
in
brief
the
ring
passed
from
hand
to
hand
through
many
generations
and
came
at
last
into
the
possession
of
a
man
who
had
three
goodly
and
virtuous
sons
all
very
obedient
to
their
father
wherefore
he
loved
them
all
three
alike
the
young
men
knowing
the
usance
of
the
ring
each
for
himself
desiring
to
be
the
most
honoured
among
his
folk
as
best
he
might
besought
his
father
who
was
now
an
old
man
to
leave
him
the
ring
whenas
he
came
to
die
the
worthy
man
who
loved
them
all
alike
and
knew
not
himself
how
to
choose
to
which
he
had
liefer
leave
the
ring
bethought
himself
having
promised
it
to
each
to
seek
to
satisfy
all
three
and
privily
let
make
by
a
good
craftsman
other
two
rings
which
were
so
like
unto
the
first
that
he
himself
scarce
knew
which
was
the
true
when
he
came
to
die
he
secretly
gave
each
one
of
his
sons
his
ring
wherefore
each
of
them
seeking
after
their
father
death
to
occupy
the
inheritance
and
the
honour
and
denying
it
to
the
others
produced
his
ring
in
witness
of
his
right
and
the
three
rings
being
found
so
like
unto
one
another
that
the
true
might
not
be
known

question
which
was
the
father

saladin
perceived
that
the
jew
had
excellently
well
contrived
to
escape
the
snare
which
he
had
spread
before
his
feet
wherefore
he
concluded
to
discover
to
him
his
need
and
see
if
he
were
willing
to
serve
him
and
so
accordingly
he
did
confessing
to
him
that
which
he
had
it
in
mind
to
do
had
he
not
answered
him
on
such
discreet
wise
the
jew
freely
furnished
him
with
all
that
he
required
and
the
soldan
after
satisfied
him
in
full

he
gave
him
very
great
gifts
and
still
had
him
to
friend

him
about

high

i
purpose
without
looking
for
reprehension
from
you
briefly
to
relate
with
what
address
a
monk
delivered
his
body
from
a
very
grievous
punishment
there
was
in
lunigiana
a
country
not
very
far
hence
a
monastery
whilere
more
abounding
in
sanctity
and
monks
than
it
is
nowadays
and
therein
among
others
was
a
young
monk
whose
vigour
and
lustiness
neither
fasts
nor
vigils
availed
to
mortify
it
chanced
one
day
towards
noontide
when
all
the
other
monks
slept
that
as
he
went
all
alone
round
about
the
convent
which
stood
in
a
very
solitary
place
he
espied
a
very
lass
belike
some
daughter
of
the
country
who
went
about
the
fields
culling
certain
herbs
and
no
sooner
had
he
set
eyes
on
her
than
he
was
violently
assailed
by
carnal
appetite
wherefore
accosting
her
he
entered
into
parley
with
her
and
so
led
on
from
one
thing
to
another
that
he
came
to
an
accord
with
her
and
brought
her
to
his
cell
unperceived
of
any
but
whilst
carried
away
by
overmuch
ardour
he
disported
himself
with
her
less
cautiously
than
was
prudent
it
chanced
that
the
abbot
arose
from
sleep
and
softly
passing
by
the
monk
cell
heard
the
racket
that
the
twain
made
together
whereupon
he
came
stealthily
up
to
the
door
to
listen
that
he
might
the
better
recognize
the
voices
and
manifestly
perceiving
that
there
was
a
woman
in
the
cell
was
at
first
minded
to
cause
open
to
him
but
after
bethought
himself
to
hold
another
course
in
the
matter
and
returning
to
his
chamber
awaited
the
monk
coming
forth
footnote
lit
his
church
but
the
context
seems
to
indicate
that
the
monastery
itself
is
meant
the
latter
all
taken
up
as
he
was
with
the
wench
and
his
exceeding
pleasure
and
delight
in
her
company
was
none
the
less
on
his
guard
and
himseeming
he
heard
some
scuffling
of
feet
in
the
dormitory
he
set
his
eye
to
a
crevice
and
plainly
saw
the
abbot
stand
hearkening
unto
him
whereby
he
understood
but
too
well
that
the
latter
must
have
gotten
wind
of
the
wench
presence
in
his
cell
and
knowing
that
sore
punishment
would
ensue
to
him
thereof
he
was
beyond
measure
chagrined
however
without
discovering
aught
of
his
concern
to
the
girl
he
hastily
revolved
many
things
in
himself
seeking
to
find
some
means
of
escape
and
presently
hit
upon
a
rare
device
which
went
straight
to
the
mark
he
aimed
at
accordingly
making
a
show
of
thinking
he
had
abidden
long
enough
with
the
damsel
he
said
to
her
must
go
cast
about
for
a
means
how
thou
mayest
win
forth
hence
without
being
seen
wherefore
do
thou
abide
quietly
until
my
return
then
going
forth
and
locking
the
cell
door
on
her
he
betook
himself
straight
to
the
abbot
chamber
and
presenting
him
with
the
key
according
as
each
monk
did
whenas
he
went
abroad
said
to
him
with
a
good
countenance
i
was
unable
to
make
an
end
this
morning
of
bringing
off
all
the
faggots
i
had
cut
wherefore
with
your
leave
i
will
presently
go
to
the
wood
and
fetch
them
away
the
abbot
deeming
the
monk
unaware
that
he
had
been
seen
of
him
was
glad
of
such
an
opportunity
to
inform
himself
more
fully
of
the
offence
committed
by
him
and
accordingly
took
the
key
and
gave
him
the
leave
he
sought
then
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
gone
he
fell
to
considering
which
he
should
rather
do
whether
open
his
cell
in
the
presence
of
all
the
other
monks
and
cause
them
to
see
his
default
so
they
might
after
have
no
occasion
to
murmur
against
himself
whenas
he
should
punish
the
offender
or
seek
first
to
learn
from
the
girl
herself
how
the
thing
had
passed
and
bethinking
himself
that
she
might
perchance
be
the
wife
or
daughter
of
such
a
man
that
he
would
be
loath
to
have
done
her
the
shame
of
showing
her
to
all
the
monks
he
determined
first
to
see
her
and
after
come
to
a
conclusion
wherefore
betaking
himself
to
the
cell
he
opened
it
and
entering
shut
the
door
after
him
the
girl
seeing
the
abbot
enter
was
all
aghast
and
fell
for
fear
of
shame
but
my
lord
abbot
casting
his
eyes
upon
her
and
seeing
her
young
and
handsome
old
as
he
was
suddenly
felt
the
pricks
of
the
flesh
no
less
importunate
than
his
young
monk
had
done
and
fell
in
himself
why
should
i
not
take
somewhat
of
pleasure
whenas
i
may
more
by
token
that
displeasance
and
annoy
are
still
at
hand
whenever
i
have
a
mind
to
them
this
is
a
handsome
wench
and
is
here
unknown
of
any
in
the
world
if
i
can
bring
her
to
do
my
pleasure
i
know
not
why
i
should
not
do
it
who
will
know
it
no
one
will
ever
know
it
and
a
sin
that
hidden
is
half
forgiven
maybe
this
chance
will
never
occur
again
i
hold
it
great
sense
to
avail
ourselves
of
a
good
whenas
god
the
lord
sendeth
us
thereof
so
saying
and
having
altogether
changed
purpose
from
that
wherewith
he
came
he
drew
near
to
the
girl
and
began
gently
to
comfort
her
praying
her
not
to
weep
and
passing
from
one
word
to
another
he
ended
by
discovering
to
her
his
desire
the
girl
who
was
neither
iron
nor
adamant
readily
enough
lent
herself
to
the
pleasure
of
the
abbot
who
after
he
had
clipped
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
mounted
upon
the
monk
pallet
and
having
belike
regard
to
the
grave
burden
of
his
dignity
and
the
girl
tender
age
and
fearful
of
irking
her
for
overmuch
heaviness
bestrode
not
her
breast
but
set
her
upon
his
own
and
so
a
great
while
disported
himself
with
her
meanwhile
the
monk
who
had
only
made
believe
to
go
to
the
wood
and
had
hidden
himself
in
the
dormitory
was
altogether
reassured
whenas
he
saw
the
abbot
enter
his
cell
alone
doubting
not
but
his
device
should
have
effect
and
when
he
saw
him
lock
the
door
from
within
he
held
it
for
certain
accordingly
coming
forth
of
his
he
stealthily
betook
himself
to
a
crevice
through
which
he
both
heard
and
saw
all
that
the
abbot
did
and
said
when
it
seemed
to
the
latter
that
he
had
tarried
long
enough
with
the
damsel
he
locked
her
in
the
cell
and
returned
to
his
own
chamber
whence
after
awhile
he
heard
the
monk
stirring
and
deeming
him
returned
from
the
wood
thought
to
rebuke
him
severely
and
cast
him
into
prison
so
himself
might
alone
possess
the
prey
he
had
gotten
wherefore
sending
for
him
he
very
grievously
rebuked
him
and
with
a
stern
countenance
and
commanded
that
he
should
be
put
in
prison
the
monk
very
readily
answered
i
have
not
yet
pertained
long
enough
to
the
order
of
benedict
to
have
been
able
to
learn
every
particular
thereof
and
you
had

commended

had
taken
somewhat
of
rest
in
chambers
adorned
to

themselves
at

the

to

gazing
with
delight
the

upon
the
lovely
marchioness
was
mightily
pleased
with
his
entertainment
but
after
awhile
as
the
viands
followed
one
upon

he
began
somewhat
to
marvel
perceiving
that
for
all
the
diversity
of
the
dishes
they
were
nevertheless
of
nought
other
than
hens
and
this
although
he
knew
the
part
where
he
was
to
be
such
as
should
abound
in
game
of
various
kinds
and
although
he
had
by
advising
the
lady
in

given
her

to

however
much
as

might
marvel

he
chose
not

in

dignities
they
may
differ
somewhat
from
others

natheless

of

as

the
king
hearing
this
right
well
apprehended
the
meaning
of
the
banquet
of
hens
and
the
virtue
hidden
in
her
speech
and
perceived
that
words
would
be
wasted
upon
such
a
lady
and
that
violence
was
out
of
the
question
wherefore
even
as
he
had
taken
fire
for

now
it
behoved
him
sagely
for
his
own
honour
sake
stifle
his
passion
accordingly
without
making
any
more
words
with
her
for
fear
of

replies
he
dined
out
of

and
the
meal
ended
thanking
her
for
the
honourable
entertainment

had
received
from

there
was

none

who
delighted

feared

and
happen
on
a

where
there
might

no

readily
to
be
found
wherefore
in
order
that
if
this
should
betide
he
might
not
suffer
for
lack
of
food
he
bethought
himself
to
carry
with
him
three
cakes
of
bread
judging
that
water
albeit
it
was
little
to
his
taste
he
should
find
everywhere
the
bread
he
put
in
his
bosom
and
setting
out
was
fortunate
enough
to
reach
the
abbot
residence
before
the
he
entered
and
went
spying
all
about
and
seeing
the
great
multitude
of
tables
set
and
the
mighty
preparations
making
in
the
kitchen
and
what
not
else
provided
against
dinner
said
in
himself
of
a
truth
this
abbot
is
as
magnificent
as
folk
say
after
he
had
abidden
awhile
intent
upon
these
things
the
abbot
seneschal
being
come
bade
bring
water
for
the
hands
which
being
done
he
seated
each
man
at
table
and
it
chanced
that
primasso
was
set
right
over
against
the
door
of
the
chamber
whence
the
abbot
should
come
forth
into
the
now
it
was
the
usance
in
that
house
that
neither
wine
nor
bread
nor
aught
else
of
meat
or
drink
should
ever
be
set
on
the
tables
except
the
abbot
were
first
came
to
sit
at
his
own
table
accordingly
the
seneschal
having
set
the
tables
let
tell
the
abbot
that
whenas
it
pleased
him
the
meat
was
ready
the
abbot
let
open
the
that
he
might
pass
into
the
saloon
and
looking
before
him
as
he
came
as
chance
would
have
it
the
first
who
met
his
eyes
was
primasso
who
was
very
ill
accoutred
and
whom
he
knew
not
by
sight
when
he
saw
him
incontinent
there
came
into
his
mind
an
ill
thought
and
one
that
had
never
yet
been
there
and
he
said
in
himself
see
to
whom
i
give
my
substance
to
eat
then
turning
back
he
bade
shut
the
and
enquired
of
those
who
were
about
him
if
any
knew
yonder
losel
who
sat
at
table
over
against
his
but
all
answered
no
meanwhile
primasso
who
had
a
mind
to
eat
having
come
a
journey
and
being
unused
to
fast
waited
awhile
and
seeing
that
the
abbot
came
not
pulled
out
of
his
bosom
one
of
the
three
cakes
of
bread
he
had
brought
with
him
and
fell
to
eating
the
abbot
after
he
had
waited
awhile
bade
one
of
his
look
if
primasso
were
gone
and
the
man
answered
no
my
lord
nay
he
eateth
bread
which
it
seemeth
he
hath
brought
with

quoth
the
abbot
well
let
him
eat
of
his
own
an
he
have
thereof
for
of
ours
he
shall
not
eat
now
he
would
fain
have
had
primasso
depart
of
his
own
motion
himseeming
it
were
not
well
done
to
turn
him
away
but
the
latter
having
eaten
one
cake
of
bread
and
the
abbot
coming
not
began
upon
the
second
the
which
was
likewise
reported
to
the
abbot
who
had
caused
look
if
he
were
gone
at
last
the
abbot
still
tarrying
primasso
having
eaten
the
second
cake
began
upon
the
third
and
this
again
was
reported
to
the
abbot
who
fell
in
himself
and
saying
alack
what
new
maggot
is
this
that
is
come
into
my
head
what
avarice
what
despite
and
for

this

had

thereto

ever

came
there

my

entered

man

not
have
assailed
me
for
a
man
of
little
account
needs
must
this
who
seemeth
to
me
a
losel
be
some
great
matter
since
my
soul
hath
thus
repugned
to
do
him
honour
so
saying
he
desired
to
know
who
he
was
and
finding
that
it
was
primasso
whom
he
had
long
known
by
report
for
a
man
of
merit
come
thither
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
that
which
he
had
heard
of
his
magnificence
was
ashamed
and
eager
to
make
him
amends
studied
in
many
ways
to
do
him
honour
moreover
after
eating
he
caused
clothe
him
sumptuously
as
befitted
his
quality
and
giving
him
money
and
a
palfrey
left
it
to
his
own
choice
to
go
or
stay
whereupon
primasso
well
pleased
with
his
entertainment
rendered
him
the
best
thanks
in
his
power

returned
on

there
was
then
in

a

called

to
return

my
story
from
which
a
just
indignation
hath
carried
me
somewhat
farther
astray
than
i
purposed
i
say
that
the
aforesaid
guglielmo
was
honoured
by
all
the
gentlemen
of
genoa
and
gladly
seen
of
them
and
having
sojourned
some
days
in
the
city
and
hearing
many
tales
of
messer
ermino
avarice
and
sordidness
he
desired
to
see
him
messer
ermino
having
already
heard
how
worthy
a
man
was
this
guglielmo
borsiere
and
having
yet
all
miser
as
he
was
some
tincture
of
gentle
breeding
received
him
with
very
amicable
words
and
blithe
aspect
and
entered
with
him
into
many
and
various
discourses
devising
thus
he
carried
him
together
with
other
genoese
who
were
in
his
company
into
a
fine
new
house
of
his
which
he
had
lately
built
and
after
having
shown
it
all
to
him
said
messer
guglielmo
you
who
have
seen
and
heard
many
things
can
you
tell
me
of
something
that
was
never
yet
seen
which
i
may
have
depictured
in
the
saloon
of
this
my
house
guglielmo
hearing
this
his
preposterous
question
answered
i
doubt
me
i
can
not
undertake
to
tell
you
of
aught
that
was
never
yet
seen
except
it
were
sneezings
or
the
like
but
an
it
like
you
i
will
tell
you
of
somewhat
which
me
thinketh
you
never
yet
beheld
quoth
messer
ermino
not
looking
for
such
an
answer
as
he
got
pray
you
tell
me
what
it
is
whereto
guglielmo
promptly
replied
liberality
to
be
here
depictured
when
messer
ermino
heard
this
speech
there
took
him
incontinent
such
a
shame
that
it
availed
in
a
manner
to
change
his
disposition
altogether
to
the
contrary
of
that
which
it
had
been
and
he
said
guglielmo
i
will
have
it
here
depictured
after
such
a
fashion
that
neither
you
nor
any
other
shall
ever
again
have
cause
to
tell
me
that
i
have

from

then
that
in
the
days
of
the
first
king
of
cyprus
after
the
conquest
of
the
holy
land
by
godefroi
de
bouillon
it
chanced
that
a
gentlewoman
of
gascony
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
sepulchre
and
returning
thence
came
to
cyprus
where
she
was
shamefully
abused
of
certain
lewd
fellows
whereof
having
complained
without
getting
any
satisfaction
she
thought
to
appeal
to
the
king
for
redress
but
was
told
that
she
would
lose
her
pains
for
that
he
was
of
so
abject
a
composition
and
so
little
of
worth
that
far
from
justifying
others
of
their
wrongs
he
endured
with
shameful
pusillanimity
innumerable
affronts
offered
to
himself
insomuch
that
whose
had
any
grudge
against
him
was
wont
to
vent
his
despite
by
doing
him
some
shame
or
insult
the
lady
hearing
this
and
despairing
of
redress
bethought
herself
by
way
of
some
small
solacement
of
her
chagrin
to
seek
to
rebuke
the
king
pusillanimity
wherefore
presenting
herself
in
tears
before
him
she
said
to
him
lord
i
come
not
into
thy
presence
for
any
redress
that
i
expect
of
the
wrong
that
hath
been
done
me
but
in
satisfaction
thereof
i
prithee
teach
me
how
thou
dost
to
suffer
those
affronts
which
i
understand
are
offered
unto
thyself
so
haply
i
may
learn
of
thee
patiently
to
endure
mine
own
the
which
god
knoweth
an
i
might
i
would
gladly
bestow
on
thee
since
thou
art
so
excellent
a
supporter
thereof
the
king
who
till
then
had
been
sluggish
and
supine
awoke
as
if
from
sleep
and
beginning
with
the
wrong
done
to
the
lady
which
he
cruelly
avenged
thenceforth
became

that

of
hard
upon
seventy
years
of
age
and
well

all
natural
heat
had
departed

scrupled
not
to

himself
to
the
flames
of

he
fell
to
passing
continually

on

went

in

awhile
they
betook
them
to
repose
and
arising
thence
after
none
came
all
by
command
of
their
queen
into
the
fresh
meadows
where
they
seated
themselves
round
about
her

she
who
was

and
exceeding
pleasant
of

having
sat
awhile
crowned
with

looked

bade

stories
by
telling

of
her
fashion
whereupon

without
making

blithely
began
to

the

martellino
feigneth
himself
a

cometh
not
off
scathless
wherefore
that
i
may
obey
the
queen
commandment
and
give
beginning
to
the
appointed
theme
with
a
story
of
mine
i
purpose
to
relate
to
you
that
which
first
misfortunately
and
after
happily
beyond
his
every
thought
betided
a
townsman
of
ours
no
great
while
agone
there
was
at
treviso
a
german
called
arrigo
who
being
a
poor
man
served
whoso
required
him
to
carry
burdens
for
hire
and
withal
he
was
held
of
all
a
man
of
very
holy
and
good
life
wherefore
be
it
true
or
untrue
when
he
died
it
befell
according
to
that
which
the
trevisans
avouch
that
in
the
hour
of
his
death
the
bells
of
the
great
church
of
treviso
began
to
ring
without
being
pulled
of
any
the
people
of
the
city
accounting
this
a
miracle
proclaimed
this
arrigo
a
saint
and
running
all
to
the
house
where
he
lay
bore
his
body
for
that
of
a
saint
to
the
cathedral
whither
they
fell
to
bringing
the
halt
the
impotent
and
the
blind
and
others
afflicted
with
whatsoever
defect
or
infirmity
as
if
they
should
all
be
made
whole
by
the
touch
of
the
body
in
the
midst
of
this
great
turmoil
and
concourse
of
folk
it
chanced
that
there
arrived
at
treviso
three
of
our
townsmen
whereof
one
was
called
stecchi
another
martellino
and
the
third
marchese
men
who
visited
the
courts
of
princes
and
lords
and
diverted
the
beholders
by
travestying
themselves
and
counterfeiting
whatsoever
other
man
with
rare
motions
and
grimaces
never
having
been
there
before
and
seeing
all
the
folk
run
they
marvelled
and
hearing
the
cause
were
for
going
to
see
what
was
toward
wherefore
they
laid
up
their
baggage
at
an
inn
and
marchese
said
would
fain
go
look
upon
this
saint
but
for
my
part
i
see
not
how
we
may
avail
to
win
thither
for
that
i
understand
the
cathedral
place
is
full
of
german
and
other
whom
the
lord
of
this
city
hath
stationed
there
so
no
riot
may
betide
more
by
token
that
they
say
the
church
is
so
full
of
folk
that
well
nigh
none
else
might
enter
there
not
that
hinder
you
quoth
martellino
who
was
all
agog
to
see
the
show
warrant
you
i
will
find
a
means
of
winning
to
the
holy
body
so
asked
marchese
and
martellino
answered
will
tell
thee
i
will
counterfeit
myself
a
cripple
and
thou
on
one
side
and
stecchi
on
the
other
shall
go
upholding
me
as
it
were
i
could
not
walk
of
myself
making
as
if
you
would
fain
bring
me
to
the
saint
so
he
may
heal
me
there
will
be
none
but
seeing
us
will
make
way
for
us
and
let
us
pass
the
device
pleased
marchese
and
stecchi
and
they
went
forth
of
the
inn
without
delay
all
three
whenas
they
came
to
a
solitary
place
martellino
writhed
his
hands
and
fingers
and
arms
and
legs
and
eke
his
mouth
and
eyes
and
all
his
visnomy
on
such
wise
that
it
was
a
frightful
thing
to
look
upon
nor
was
there
any
saw
him
but
would
have
avouched
him
to
be
verily
all
fordone
and
palsied
of
his
person
marchese
and
stecchi
taking
him
up
counterfeited
as
he
was
made
straight
for
the
church
with
a
show
of
the
utmost
compunction
humbly
beseeching
all
who
came
in
their
way
for
the
love
of
god
to
make
room
for
them
the
which
was
lightly
yielded
them
brief
every
one
gazing
on
them
and
crying
well
nigh
all
way
make
way
they
came
whereas
saint
arrigo
body
lay
and
martellino
was
forthright
taken
up
by
certain
gentlemen
who
stood
around
and
laid
upon
the
body
so
he
might
thereby
regain
the
benefit
of
health
martellino
having
lain
awhile
whilst
all
the
folk
were
on
the
stretch
to
see
what
should
come
of
him
began
as
right
well
he
knew
how
to
make
a
show
of
opening
first
one
finger
then
a
hand
and
after
putting
forth
an
arm
and
so
at
last
coming
to
stretch
himself
out
altogether
which
when
the
people
saw
they
set
up
such
an
outcry
in
praise
of
saint
arrigo
as
would
have
drowned
the
very
thunder
now
as
chance
would
have
it
there
was
therenigh
a
certain
florentine
who
knew
martellino
very
well
but
had
not
recognized
him
counterfeited
as
he
was
whenas
he
was
brought
thither
however
when
he
saw
him
grown
straight
again
he
knew
him
and
straightway
fell
and
saying
confound
him
who
that
saw
him
come
had
not
deemed
him
palsied
in
good
earnest
his
words
were
overheard
of
sundry
trevisans
who
asked
him
incontinent
was
he
not
palsied
forbid
answered
the
florentine
hath
ever
been
as
straight
as
any
one
of
us
but
he
knoweth
better
than
any
man
in
the
world
how
to
play
off
tricks
of
this
kind
and
counterfeit
what
shape
soever
he
will
when
the
others
heard
this
there
needed
nothing
farther
but
they
pushed
forward
by
main
force
and
fell
out
and
saying
yonder
traitor
and
scoffer
at
god
and
his
saints
who
being
whole
of
his
body
hath
come
hither
in
the
guise
of
a
cripple
to
make
mock
of
us
and
of
our
saint
so
saying
they
laid
hold
of
martellino
and
pulled
him
down
from
the
place
where
he
lay
then
taking
him
by
the
hair
of
his
head
and
tearing
all
the
clothes
off
his
back
they
fell
upon
him
with
cuffs
and
kicks
nor
himseemed
was
there
a
man
in
the
place
but
ran
to
do
likewise
martellino
roared
out
for
sake
and
fended
himself
as
best
he
might
but
to
no
avail
for
the
crowd
redoubled
upon
him
momently
stecchi
and
marchese
seeing
this
began
to
say
one
to
the
other
that
things
stood
ill
but
fearing
for
themselves
dared
not
come
to
his
aid
nay
they
cried
out
with
the
rest
to
put
him
to
death
bethinking
them
the
while
how
they
might
avail
to
fetch
him
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
who
would
certainly
have
slain
him
but
for
a
means
promptly
taken
by
marchese
to
wit
all
the
officers
of
the
seignory
being
without
the
church
he
betook
himself
as
quickliest
he
might
to
him
who
commanded
for
the
provost
and
said
for
god
sake
there
is
a
lewd
fellow
within
who
hath
cut
my
purse
with
a
good
hundred
gold
florins
i
pray
you
take
him
so
i
may
have
mine
own
again
hearing
this
a
round
dozen
of
sergeants
ran
straightway
whereas
the
wretched
martellino
was
being
carded
without
a
comb
and
having
with
the
greatest
pains
in
the
world
broken
through
the
crowd
dragged
him
out
of
the
people
hands
all
bruised
and
tumbled
as
he
was
and
haled
him
off
to
the
palace
whither
many
followed
him
who
held
themselves
affronted
of
him
and
hearing
that
he
had
been
taken
for
a
cutpurse
and
themseeming
they
had
no
better
occasion
of
doing
him
an
ill
turn
began
each
on
like
wise
to
say
that
he
had
cut
his
purse
the
provost
judge
who
was
a
crabbed
fellow
hearing
this
forthright
took
him
apart
and
began
to
examine
him
of
the
matter
but
martellino
answered
jestingly
as
if
he
made
light
of
his
arrest
whereat
the
judge
incensed
caused
truss
him
up
and
give
him
two
or
three
good
bouts
of
the
strappado
with
intent
to
make
him
confess
that
which
they
laid
to
his
charge
so
he
might
after
have
him
strung
up
by
the
neck

this
passage
like
so
many
others
of
the
decameron
is
ambiguous
and
may
also
be
read
themseeming
none
other
had
a
juster
title
to
do
him
an
ill
turn
when
he
was
let
down
again
the
judge
asked
him
once
more
if
that
were
true
which
the
folk
avouched
against
him
and
martellino
seeing
that
it
availed
him
not
to
deny
answered
lord
i
am
ready
to
confess
the
truth
to
you
but
first
make
each
who
accuseth
me
say
when
and
where
i
cut
his
purse
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
did
and
what
not
quoth
the
judge
will
well
and
calling
some
of
his
accusers
put
the
question
to
them
whereupon
one
said
that
he
had
cut
his
purse
eight
another
six
and
a
third
four
days
agone
whilst
some
said
that
very
day
martellino
hearing
this
said
lord
these
all
lie
in
their
throats
and
i
can
give
you
this
proof
that
i
tell
you
the
truth
inasmuch
as
would
god
it
were
as
sure
that
i
had
never
come
hither
as
it
is
that
i
was
never
in
this
place
till
a
few
hours
agone
and
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
went
of
my
ill
fortune
to
see
yonder
holy
body
in
the
church
where
i
was
carded
as
you
may
see
and
that
this
i
say
is
true
the
prince
officer
who
keepeth

can
certify

and
his

also
can
my

therefore
you
find
it
as
i
tell
you
i
beseech
you
torture
me
not
neither
put
me
to
death
at
the
instance
of
these
wicked
men
whilst
things
were
at
this
pass
marchese
and
stecchi
hearing
that
the
judge
of
the
provostry
was
proceeding
rigorously
against
martellino
and
had
already
given
him
the
strappado
were
sore
affeared
and
said
in
themselves
have
gone
the
wrong
way
to
work
we
have
brought
him
forth
of
the
and
cast
him
into
the
fire
wherefore
they
went
with
all
diligence
in
quest
of
their
host
and
having
found
him
related
to
him
how
the
case
stood
he
laughed
and
carried
them
to
one
sandro
agolanti
who
abode
in
treviso
and
had
great
interest
with
the
prince
and
telling
him
everything
in
order
joined
with
them
in
beseeching
him
to
occupy
himself
with
affairs
sandro
after
many
a
laugh
repaired
to
the
prince
and
prevailed
upon
him
to
send
for
martellino
the
prince
messengers
found
martellino
still
in
his
shirt
before
the
judge
all
confounded
and
sore
adread
for
that
the
judge
would
hear
nothing
in
his
excuse
nay
having
by
chance
some
spite
against
the
people
of
florence
he
was
altogether
determined
to
hang
him
by
the
neck
and
would
on
no
wise
render
him
up
to
the
prince
till
such
time
as
he
was
constrained
thereto
in
his
despite
martellino
being
brought
before
the
lord
of
the
city
and
having
told
him
everything
in
order
besought
him
by
way
of
special
favour
to
let
him
go
about
his
business
for
that
until
he
should
be
in
florence
again
it
would
still
seem
to
him
he
had
the
rope
about
his
neck
the
prince
laughed
heartily
at
his
mischance
and
let
give
each
of
the
three
a
suit
of
apparel
wherewith
they
returned

religious

in
the
days
then
of
the
marquis
azzo
of
ferrara
there
came
a
merchant
called
rinaldo
to
bologna
on
his
occasions
which
having
despatched
and
returning
homeward
it
chanced
that
as
he
issued
forth
of
ferrara
and
rode
towards
verona
he
fell
in
with
certain
folk
who
seemed
merchants
but
were
in
truth
highwaymen
and
men
of
lewd
life
and
condition
with
whom
he
unwarily
joined
company
and
entered
into
discourse
they
seeing
him
to
be
a
merchant
and
judging
him
to
have
monies
about
him
took
counsel
together
to
rob
him
at
the
first
opportunity
that
should
offer
wherefore
that
he
might
take
no
suspicion
they
went
devising
with
him
like
decent
peaceable
folk
of
things
honest
and
seemly
and
of
loyalty
ordering
themselves
toward
him
in
so
far
as
they
knew
and
could
with
respect
and
complaisance
so
that
he
deemed
himself
in
great
luck
to
have
met
with
them
for
that
he
was
alone
with
a
of
his
on
horseback
thus
faring
on
and
passing
from
one
thing
to
another
as
it
chanceth
in
discourse
they
presently
fell
to
talking
of
the
orisons
that
men
offer
up
to
god
and
one
of
the
highwaymen
who
were
three
in
number
said
to
rinaldo
you
fair
sir
what
orison
do
you
use
to
say
on
a
journey
whereto
he
answered
to
say
i
am
but
a
plain
man
and
little
versed
in
these
matters
and
have
few
orisons
in
hand
i
live
after
the
old
fashion
and
let
a
couple
of
shillings
pass
for
pence
nevertheless
i
have
still
been
wont
when
on
a
journey
to
say
of
a
morning
what
time
i
come
forth
of
the
inn
a
pater
and
an
ave
for
the
soul
of
julian
father
and
mother
after
which
i
pray
god
and
the
saint
to
grant
me
a
good
lodging
for
the
ensuing
night
many
a
time
in
my
day
have
i
in
the
course
of
my
journeyings
been
in
great
perils
from
all
of
which
i
have
escaped
and
have
still
found
myself
at
night
to
boot
in
a
place
of
safety
and
well
lodged
wherefore
i
firmly
believe
that
julian
in
whose
honour
i
say
it
hath
gotten
me
this
favour
of
god
nor
meseemeth
should
i
fare
well
by
day
nor
come
to
good
harbourage
at
night
except
i
had
said
it
in
the
morning
did
you
say
it
this
morning
asked
he
who
had
put
the
question
to
him
did
i
answered
rinaldo
whereupon
quoth
the
other
in
himself
knowing
well
how
the
thing
was
to
go
it
stand
thee
in
stead
for
an
no
hindrance
betide
us
methinketh
thou
art
like
to
lodge
then
to
rinaldo
likewise
quoth
he
travelled
much
and
have
never
said
this
orison
albeit
i
have
heard
it
greatly
commended
nor
ever
hath
it
befallen
me
to
lodge
other
than
well
and
this
evening
maybe
you
shall
chance
to
see
which
will
lodge

better
you

have
said
it

thereof

they
came
late
in
the
day
to
a
place
a
little
beyond
castel

at
the
fording
of
a
river
the
three
rogues
seeing
the
hour
advanced
and
the
spot
solitary
and
close
shut
in
fell
upon
rinaldo
and
robbed
him
of
money
clothes
and
horse
then
leaving
him
afoot
and
in
his
shirt
they
departed
saying
see
if
thy
julian

give
thee
a

this
night
even
as
ours
will
assuredly
do
for
us
and
passing

they
went

rinaldo
servant
seeing
him
attacked
like
a
cowardly
knave
as
he
was
did
nought
to
help
him
but
turning
his
horse
head
never
drew
bridle
till
he
came
to
castel

entering

town
took
up
his
lodging

our
patron
saint
rinaldo
left
in
his
shirt
and
barefoot
it
being
very
cold
and
snowing
hard
knew
not
what
to
do
and
seeing
the
night
already
at
hand
looked
about
him
trembling
and
chattering
the
while
with
his
teeth
if
there
were
any
shelter
to
be
seen
therenigh
where
he
might
pass
the
night
so
he
should
not
perish
of
cold
but
seeing
none
for
that
a
little
before
there
had
been
war
in
those
parts
and
everything
had
been
burnt
set
off
at
a
run
spurred
by
the
cold
towards
castel
guglielmo
knowing
not
withal
if
his
servant
were
fled
thither
or
otherwise
and
thinking
that
so
he
might
but
avail
to
enter
therein
god
would
send
him
some
relief
but
darkness
overtook
him
near
a
mile
from
the
town
wherefore
he
arrived
there
so
late
that
the
gates
being
shut
and
the
raised
he
could
get
no
admission
thereupon
despairing
and
disconsolate
he
looked
about
weeping
for
a
place
where
he
might
shelter
so
at
the
least
it
should
not
snow
upon
him
and
chancing
to
espy
a
house
that
projected
somewhat
beyond
the
walls
of
the
town
he
determined
to
go
bide
thereunder
till
day
accordingly
betaking
himself
thither
he
found
there
a
door
albeit
it
was
shut
and
gathering
at
foot
thereof
somewhat
of
straw
that
was
therenigh
he
laid
himself
down
there
tristful
and
woebegone
complaining
sore
to
julian
and
saying
that
this
was
not
of
the
faith
he
had
in
him
however
the
saint
had
not
lost
sight
of
him
and
was
not
long
in
providing
him
with
a
good
lodging
there
was
in
the
town
a
widow
lady
as
fair
of
favour
as
any
woman
living
whom
the
marquis
azzo
loved
as
his
life
and
there
kept
at
his
disposition
and
she
abode
in
that
same
house
beneath
the
projection
whereof
rinaldo
had
taken
shelter
now
as
chance
would
have
it
the
marquis
had
come
to
the
town
that
day
thinking
to
lie
the
night
with
her
and
had
privily
let
make
ready
in
her
house
a
bath
and
a
sumptuous
supper
everything
being
ready
and
nought
awaited
by
the
lady
but
the
coming
of
the
marquis
it
chanced
that
there
came
a
to
the
gate
who
brought
him
news
which
obliged
him
to
take
horse
forthright
wherefore
sending
to
tell
his
mistress
not
to
expect
him
he
departed
in
haste
the
lady
somewhat
disconsolate
at
this
knowing
not
what
to
do
determined
to
enter
the
bath
prepared
for
the
marquis
and
after
sup
and
go
to
bed
accordingly
she
entered
the
bath
which
was
near
the
door
against
which
the
wretched
merchant
was
crouched
without
the
wherefore
she
being
therein
heard
the
weeping
and
trembling
kept
up
by
rinaldo
who
seemed
as
he
were
grown
a
stork
and
calling
her
maid
said
to
her
up
and
look
over
the
wall
who
is
at
the
and
what
he
doth
there
the
maid
went
thither
and
aided
by
the
clearness
of
the
air
saw
rinaldo
in
his
shirt
and
barefoot
sitting
there
as
hath
been
said
and
trembling
sore
whereupon
she
asked
him
who
he
was
he
told
her
as
briefliest
he
might
who
he
was
and
how
and
why
he
was
there
trembling
the
while
on
such
wise
that
he
could
scarce
form
the
words
and
after
fell
to
beseeching
her
piteously
not
to
leave
him
there
all
night
to
perish
of
cold
but
to
succour
him
an
it
might
be
the
maid
was
moved
to
pity
of
him
and
returning
to
her
mistress
told
her
all
the
lady
on
like
wise
taking
compassion
on
him
and
remembering
that
she
had
the
key
of
the
door
aforesaid
which
served
whiles
for
the
privy
entrances
of
the
marquis
said
softly
and
open
to
him
here
is
this
supper
and
none
to
eat
it
and
we
have
commodity
enough
for
his
lodging
footnote
whose
teeth
chattered
as
it
were
the
clapping
of
a
stork
beak
the
maid
having
greatly
commended
her
mistress
for
this
her
humanity
went
and
opening
to
rinaldo
brought
him
in
whereupon
the
lady
seeing
him
well
nigh
palsied
with
cold
said
to
him
good
man
enter
this
bath
which
is
yet
warm
rinaldo
without
awaiting
farther
invitation
gladly
obeyed
and
was
so
recomforted
with
the
warmth
of
the
bath
that
himseemed
he
was
come
back
from
death
to
life
the
lady
let
fetch
him
a
suit
of
clothes
that
had
pertained
to
her
husband
then
lately
dead
which
when
he
had
donned
they
seemed
made
to
his
measure
and
whilst
awaiting
what
she
should
command
him
he
fell
to
thanking
god
and
julian
for
that
they
had
delivered
him
from
the
scurvy
night
he
had
in
prospect
and
had
as
he
deemed
brought
him
to
good
harbourage
presently
the
lady
being
somewhat
rested
let
make
a
great
fire
in
her
and
betaking
herself
thither
asked
how
it
was
with
the
poor
man
whereto
the
maid
answered
he
hath
clad
himself
and
is
a
handsome
man
and
appeareth
a
person
of
good
condition
and
very
quoth
the
lady
call
him
and
bid
him
come
to
the
fire
and
sup
for
i
know
he
is
fasting
accordingly
rinaldo
entered
the
hall
and
seeing
the
gentlewoman
who
appeared
to
him
a
lady
of
quality
saluted
her
respectfully
and
rendered
her
the
best
thanks
in
his
power
for
the
kindness
done
him
the
lady
having
seen
and
heard
him
and
finding
him
even
as
her
maid
had
said
received
him
graciously
and
making
him
sit
familiarly
with
her
by
the
fire
questioned
him
of
the
chance
that
had
brought
him
thither
whereupon
he
related
everything
to
her
in
order
now
she
had
heard
somewhat
of
this
at
the
time
of
his
servant
coming
into
the
town
wherefore
she
gave
entire
belief
to
all
he
said
and
told
him
in
turn
what
she
knew
of
his
servant
and
how
he
might
lightly
find
him
again
on
the
morrow
then
the
table
being
laid
rinaldo
at
the
lady
instance
washed
his
hands
and
sat
down
with
her
to
supper
now
he
was
tall
of
his
person
and
comely
and
pleasant
of
favour
and
very
engaging
and
agreeable
of
manners
and
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
wherefore
the
lady
had
several
times
cast
her
eyes
on
him
and
found
him
much
to
her
liking
and
her
desires
being
already
aroused
for
the
marquis
who
was
to
have
come
to
lie
with
her
she
had
taken
a
mind
to
him
accordingly
after
supper
whenas
they
were
risen
from
table
she
took
counsel
with
her
maid
whether
herseemed
she
would
do
well
the
marquis
having
left
her
in
the
lurch
to
use
the
good
which
fortune
had
sent
her
the
maid
seeing
her
mistress
drift
encouraged
her
as
best
she
might
to
ensue
it
whereupon
the
lady
returning
to
the
fireside
where
she
had
left
rinaldo
alone
fell
to
gazing
amorously
upon
him
and
said
to
him
now
rinaldo
why
bide
you
thus
melancholy
think
you
you
can
not
be
requited

loss
of
a
horse

some
small

rinaldo
who
was
no

hearing
these
words

seeing
the
lady
eyes
sparkle
advanced
towards
her
with
open
arms

considering
that
i
owe
it
to
you
to
say
that
i
am
now
alive

you

me

i

you
embrace

me

willingly
there
needed
no
more

the
lady
who
was
all
afire
with
amorous
longing
straightway
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
after
she
had
strained
him
desirefully
to
her
bosom
and
bussed
him
a
thousand
times
and
had
of
him
been
kissed
as
often
they
went
off
to

themselves

having

commandment
she
proceeded

all

things
which
we

are
in

are
consequently
according

transmuted

her
without

conclusively

hath

pleasure
that

add
to

stories
aforesaid
one
of
my
own
which
methinketh
should
please
there
was
once
in
our
city
a
gentleman
by
name
messer
tedaldo
who
as
some
will
have
it
was
of
the
lamberti
family
albeit
others
avouch
that
he
was
of
the
agolanti
arguing
more
belike
from
the
craft
after
followed
by
his
sons
which
was
like
unto
that
which
the
agolanti
have
ever
practised
and
yet
practise
than
from
aught
else
but
leaving
be
of
which
of
these
two
houses
he
was
i
say
that
he
was
in
his
time
a
very
rich
gentleman

sons
whereof

eldest
was
named
lamberto
the

and
the
third
agolante
all
handsome
and
sprightly
youths
the
eldest
of
whom
had
not
reached
his
eighteenth
year
when
it
befell
that
the
aforesaid
messer
tedaldo
died
very
rich
and
left
all
his
possessions
both
moveable
and
immoveable
to
them
as
his
legitimate
heirs
the
young
men
seeing
themselves
left
very
rich
both
in
lands
and
monies
began
to
spend
without
check
or
reserve
or
other
governance
than
that
of
their
own
pleasure
keeping
a
vast
household
and
many
and
goodly
horses
and
dogs
and
hawks
still
holding
open
house
and
giving
largesse
and
making
tilts
and
tournaments
and
doing
not
only
that
which

it
occurred
to
their
youthful
appetite

footnote
usury
see
post
one
of
the
commentators
ridiculously
suggests
that
they
were
needlemakers
from
a
needle
they
had
not
long
led
this
manner
of
life
before
the
treasure
left
by
their
father
melted
away
and
their
revenues
alone
sufficing
not
unto
their
current
expenses
they
proceeded
to
sell
and
mortgage
their
estates
and
selling
one
and
another
they
found
themselves
well
nigh
to
nought
without
perceiving
it
and
poverty
opened
their
eyes
which
wealth
had
kept
closed
whereupon
lamberto
one
day
calling
the
other
two
reminded
them
how
great
had
been
their
father
magnificence
and
how
great
their
own
and
setting
before
them
what
wealth
had
been
theirs
and
the
poverty
to
which
they
were
come
through
their
inordinate
expenditure
exhorted
them
as
best
he
knew
ere
their
distress
should
become
more
apparent
to
sell
what
little
was
left
them
and
get
them
gone
together
with
himself
they
did
as
he
counselled
them
and
departing
florence
without
leavetaking
or
ceremony
stayed
not
till
they
came
to
england
where
taking
a
little
house
in
london
and
spending
very
little
they
addressed
themselves
with
the
utmost
diligence
to
lend
money
at
usance
in
this
fortune
was
so
favourable
to
them
that
in
a
few
years
they
amassed
a
vast
sum
of
money
wherewith
returning
to
florence
one
after
another
they
bought
back
great
part
of
their
estates
and
purchased
others
to
boot
and
took
unto
themselves
wives
nevertheless
they
still
continued
to
lend
money
in
england
and
sent
thither
to
look
to
their
affairs
a
young
man
a
nephew
of
theirs
alessandro
by
name
whilst
themselves
all
three
at
florence
for
all
they
were
become
fathers
of
families
forgetting
to
what
a
pass
inordinate
expenditure
had
aforetime
brought
them
began
to
spend
more
extravagantly
than
ever
and
were
high
in
credit
with
all
the
merchants
who
trusted
them
for
any
sum
of
money
however
great
the
monies
remitted
them
by
alessandro
who
had
fallen
to
lending
to
the
barons
upon
their
castles
and
other
their
possessions
which
brought
him
great
profit
helped
them
for
some
years
to
support
these
expenses
but
presently
what
while
the
three
brothers
spent
thus
freely
and
lacking
money
borrowed
still
reckoning
with
all
assurance
upon
england
it
chanced
that
contrary
to
all
expectation
there
broke
out
war
in
england
between
the
king
and
his
son
through
which
the
whole
island
was
divided
into
two
parties
some
holding
with
the
one
and
some
with
the
other
and
by
reason
thereof
all
the
castles
were
taken
from
alessandro
nor
was
there
any
other
source
of
revenue
that
answered
him
aught
hoping
that
from
day
to
day
peace
should
be
made
between
father
and
son
and
consequently
everything
restored
to
him
both
interest
and
capital
alessandro
departed
not
the
island
and
the
three
brothers
in
florence
no
wise
abated
their
extravagant
expenditure
borrowing
more
and
more
every
day
but
when
after
several
years
no
effect
was
seen
to
follow
upon
their
expectation
the
three
brothers
not
only
lost
their
credit
but
their
creditors
seeking
to
be
paid
their
due
they
were
suddenly
arrested
and
their
possessions
sufficing
not
unto
payment
they
abode
in
prison
for
the
residue
whilst
their
wives
and
little
ones
betook
themselves
some
into
the
country
some
hither
and
some
thither
in
very
ill
plight
unknowing
what
to
expect
but
misery
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
meanwhile
alessandro
after
waiting
several
years
in
england
for
peace
seeing
that
it
came
not
and
himseeming
that
not
only
was
his
tarrying
there
in
vain
but
that
he
went
in
danger
of
his
life
determined
to
return
to
italy
accordingly
he
set
out
all
alone
and
as
chance
would
have
it
coming
out
of
bruges
he
saw
an
abbot
of
white
friars
likewise
issuing
thence
accompanied
by
many
monks
and
with
a
numerous
household
and
a
great
in
his
van
after
him
came
two
old
knights
kinsmen
of
the
king
whom
alessandro
accosted
as
acquaintances
and
was
gladly
admitted
into
their
company
as
he
journeyed
with
them
he
asked
them
softly
who
were
the
monks
that
rode
in
front
with
so
great
a
train
and
whither
they
were
bound
and
one
of
them
answered
who
rideth
yonder
is
a
young
gentleman
of
our
kindred
who
hath
been
newly
elected
abbot
of
one
of
the
most
considerable
abbeys
of
england
and
for
that
he
is
younger
than
is
suffered
by
the
laws
for
such
a
dignity
we
go
with
him
to
rome
to
obtain
of
the
holy
father
that
he
dispense
him
of
his
defect
of
overmuch
youthfulness
and
confirm
him
in
the
dignity
aforesaid
but
this
must
not
be
spoken
of
with
any
the
new
abbot
faring
on
thus
now
in
advance
of
his
retinue
and
now
in
their
rear
as
daily
we
see
it
happen
with
noblemen
on
a
journey
chanced
by
the
way
to
see
near
him
alessandro
who
was
a
young
man
exceedingly
goodly
of
person
and
favour
agreeable
and
fair
of
fashion
as
any
might
be
and
who
at
first
sight
pleased
him
marvellously
as
nought
had
ever
done
and
calling
him
to
his
side
fell
pleasantly
with
him
asking
him
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
and
whither
he
was
bound
whereupon
alessandro
frankly
discovered
to
him
his
whole
case
and
satisfied
his
questions
offering
himself
to
his
service
in
what
little
he
might
the
abbot
hearing
his
goodly
and
speech
took
more
particular
note
of
his
manners
and
inwardly
judging
him
to
be
a
man
of
gentle
breeding
for
all
his
business
had
been
mean
grew
yet
more
enamoured
of
his
pleasantness
and
full
of
compassion
for
his
mishaps
comforted
him
on
very
friendly
wise
bidding
him
be
of
good
hope
for
that
an
he
were
a
man
of
worth
god
would
yet
replace
him
in
that
estate
whence
fortune
had
cast
him
down
nay
in
a
yet
higher
moreover
he
prayed
him
since
he
was
bound
for
tuscany
that
it
would
please
him
bear
him
company
inasmuch
as
himself
was
likewise
on
the
way
thitherward
whereupon
alessandro
returned
him
thanks
for
his
encouragement
and
declared
himself
ready
to
his
every
commandment
the
abbot
in
whose
breast
new
feelings
had
been
aroused
by
the
sight
of
alessandro
continuing
his
journey
it
chanced
that
after
some
days
they
came
to
a
village
not
overwell
furnished
with
hostelries
and
the
abbot
having
a
mind
to
pass
the
night
there
alessandro
caused
him
alight
at
the
house
of
an
innkeeper
who
was
his
familiar
acquaintance
and
let
prepare
him
his
in
the
least
incommodious
place
of
the
house
and
being
now
like
an
expert
man
as
he
was
grown
well
nigh
a
master
of
the
household
to
the
abbot
he
lodged
all
his
company
as
best
he
might
about
the
village
some
here
and
some
there
after
the
abbot
had
supped
the
night
being
now
well
advanced
and
every
one
gone
to
bed
alessandro
asked
the
host
where
he
himself
could
lie
whereto
he
answered
truth
i
know
not
thou
seest
that
every
place
is
full
and
i
and
my
household
must
needs
sleep
upon
the
benches
algates
in
the
abbot
chamber
there
be
certain
whereto
i
can
bring
thee
and
spread
thee
thereon
some
small
matter
of
bed
and
there
an
it
please
thee
thou
shalt
lie
this
night
as
best
thou
mayst
quoth
alessandro
shall
i
go
into
the
abbot
chamber
seeing
thou
knowest
it
is
little
and
of
its
straitness
none
of
his
monks
might
lie
there
had
i
bethought
me
of
this
ere
the
curtains
were
drawn
i
would
have
let
his
monks
lie
on
the
and
have
lodged
myself
where
they
sleep
answered
the
host
case
standeth
thus
but
an
thou
wilt
thou
mayst
lie
whereas
i
tell
thee
with
all
the
ease
in
the
world
the
abbot
is
asleep
and
his
curtains
are
drawn
i
will
quickly
lay
thee
a
there
and
do
thou
sleep
on
it
alessandro
seeing
that
this
might
be
done
without
giving
the
abbot
any
annoy
consented
thereto
and
settled
himself
on
the
as
softliest
he
might
footnote
the
thing
is
done
and
can
not
be
undone
there
is
no
help
for
it
the
abbot
who
slept
not
nay
whose
thoughts
were
ardently
occupied
with
his
new
desires
heard
what
passed
between
alessandro
and
the
host
and
noted
where
the
former
laid
himself
to
sleep
and
well
pleased
with
this
began
to
say
in
himself
hath
sent
an
occasion
unto
my
desires
an
i
take
it
not
it
may
be
long
ere
the
like
recur
to
me
accordingly
being
altogether
resolved
to
take
the
opportunity
and
himseeming
all
was
quiet
in
the
inn
he
called
to
alessandro
in
a
low
voice
and
bade
him
come
couch
with
him
alessandro
after
many
excuses
put
off
his
clothes
and
laid
himself
beside
the
abbot
who
put
his
hand
on
his
breast
and
fell
to
touching
him
no
otherwise
than
amorous
damsels
use
to
do
with
their
lovers
whereat
alessandro
marvelled
exceedingly
and
misdoubted
him
the
abbot
was
moved
by
unnatural
love
to
handle
him
on
that
wise
but
the
latter
promptly
divined
his
suspicions
whether
of
presumption
or
through
some
gesture
of
his
and
smiled
then
suddenly
putting
off
a
shirt
that
he
wore
he
took
alessandro
hand
and
laying
it
on
his
own
breast
said
put
away
thy
foolish
thought
and
searching
here
know
that
which
i
conceal
alessandro
accordingly
put
his
hand
to
the
abbot
bosom
and
found
there
two
little
breasts
round
and
firm
and
delicate
no
otherwise
than
as
they
were
of
ivory
whereby
perceiving
that
the
supposed
prelate
was
a
woman
without
awaiting
farther
bidding
he
straightway
took
her
in
his
arms
and
would
have
kissed
her
but
she
said
to
him
thou
draw
nearer
to
me
hearken
to
that
which
i
have
to
say
to
thee
as
thou
mayst
see
i
am
a
woman
and
not
a
man
and
having
left
home
a
maid
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
pope
that
he
might
marry
me
be
it
thy
good
fortune
or
my
mishap
no
sooner
did
i
see
thee
the
other
day
than
love
so
fired
me
for
thee
that
never
yet
was
woman
who
so
loved
man
wherefore
i
am
resolved
to
take
thee
before
any
other
to
husband
but
an
thou
wilt
not
have
me
to
wife
begone
hence
forthright
and
return
to
thy
place
alessandro
albeit
he
knew
her
not
having
regard
to
her
company
and
retinue
judged
her
to
be
of
necessity
noble
and
rich
and
saw
that
she
was
very
fair
wherefore
without
overlong
thought
he
replied
that
if
this
pleased
her
it
was
mighty
agreeable
to
him
accordingly
sitting
up
with
him
in
bed
she
put
a
ring
into
his
hand
and
made
him
espouse
her
before
a
picture
wherein
our
lord
was
portrayed
after
which
they
embraced
each
other
and
solaced
themselves
with
amorous
dalliance
to
the
exceeding
pleasure
of
both
parties
for
so

as
remained

the

was
formerly
and
still

in
certain
countries
the
most
essential
part
of
the
marriage
rite
when
the
day
came
after
they
had
taken
order
together
concerning
their
affairs
alessandro
arose
and
departed
the
chamber
by
the
way
he
had
entered
without
any
knowing
where
he
had
passed
the
night
then
glad
beyond

he
took
to
the
road
again
with
the
abbot
and
his
company
and
came
after
many
days
to
rome
there
they
abode
some
days
after
which
the
abbot
with
the
two
knights
and
alessandro
and
no
more
went
in
to
the
pope
and
having
done
him
due
reverence
bespoke
him
thus
father
as
you
should
know
better
than
any

to
live
well

should

may
eschew
every
occasion
that
may
lead
him
to
do
otherwise
the
which
that
i
who
would
fain
live
honestly
may
throughly
do
having
fled
privily
with
a
great
part
of
the
treasures
of
the
king
of
england
my
father
who
would
have
given
me
to
wife
to
the
king
of
scotland
a
very
old
prince
i
being
as
you
see
a
young
maid
i
set
out
habited
as
you
see
me
to
come
hither
so
your
holiness
might
marry
me
nor
was
it
so
much
the
age
of
the
king
of
scotland
that
made
me
flee
as
the
fear
if
i
were
married
to
him
lest
i
should
for
the
frailty
of
my
youth
be
led
to
do
aught
that
might
be
contrary
to
the
divine
laws
and
the
honour
of
the
royal
blood
of
my
father
as
i
came
thus
disposed
god
who
alone
knoweth
aright
that
which
behoveth
unto
every

set
before
mine

as
i
believe
of
his
mercy
him
whom
it
pleased
him
should
be
my
husband
to

this
young
man
showing
alessandro
you
see
here
beside
me
and
whose
fashions
and
desert
are
worthy
of
however
great
a
lady
although
belike
the
nobility
of
his
blood
is
not
so
illustrious
as
the
him
then
have
i
taken
and
him
i
desire
nor
will
i
ever
have
any
other
than
he
however
it
may
seem
to
my
father
or
to
other
folk
thus
the
principal
occasion
of
my
coming
is
done
away
but
it
pleased
me
to
make
an
end
of
my
journey
at
once
that
i
might
visit
the
holy
and
reverential
places
whereof
this
city
is
full
and
your
holiness
and
that
through
you
i
might
make
manifest
in
your
presence
and
consequently
in
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
the
marriage
contracted
between
alessandro
and
myself
in
the
presence
of
god
alone
wherefore
i
humbly
pray
you
that
this
which
hath
pleased
god
and
me
may
find
favour
with
you
and
that
you
will
vouchsafe
us
your
benison
in

that
with
this
as
with
more
assurance
of
his
approof
whose
vicar
you
are
we
may
live
and
ultimately
die
together
alessandro
marvelled
to
hear
that
the
damsel
was
the
king
daughter
of
england
and
was
inwardly
filled
with
exceeding
great
gladness
but
the
two
knights
marvelled
yet
more
and
were
so
incensed
that
had
they
been
otherwhere
than
in
the
pope
presence
they
had
done
alessandro
a
mischief
and
belike
the
lady
also
the
pope
also
on
his
part
marvelled
exceedingly
both
at
the
habit
of
the
lady
and
at
her
choice
but
seeing
that
there
was
no
going
back
on
that
which
was
done
he
consented
to
satisfy
her
of
her
prayer
accordingly
having
first
appeased
the
two
knights
whom
he
knew
to
be
angered
and
made
them
well
at
one
again
with
the
lady
and
alessandro
he
took
order
for
that
which
was
to
do
and
the
day
appointed
by
him
being
come
before
all
the
cardinals
and
many
other
men
of
great
worship

at
his
bidding
to
a
magnificent
prepared
by
him

produced
the
lady
royally
apparelled
who
showed
so
fair
and
so
agreeable
that
she
was
worthily
commended
of
all
and
on
like
wise
alessandro
splendidly
attired
in
bearing
and
appearance
no
whit
like
a
youth
who
had
lent
at
usury
but
rather
one
of
royal
blood
and
now

a

gave
him

in

he
approved
himself
a

made
shift

he
reconciled
the

there
ensued
great

thoroughly
recovered

as
any
in
the
world
among
the
said
cities
is
one
called
ravello
and
therein
albeit
nowadays
there
are
rich
men
there
there
was
aforetime
one
landolfo
ruffolo
by
name
who
was
exceeding
rich
and
who
his
wealth
sufficing
him
not
came
nigh
in
seeking
to
double
it
to
lose
it
all
and
himself
withal
this
man
then
having
after
the
usance
of
merchants
laid
his
plans
bought
a
great
ship
and
freighting
it
all
of
his
own
monies
with
divers
merchandise
repaired
therewith
to
cyprus
there
he
found
sundry
other
ships
come
with
the
same
kind
and
quality
of
merchandise
as
he
had
brought
by
reason
of
which
not
only
was
he
constrained
to
make
great
good
cheap
of
his
own
venture
but
it
behoved
him
an
he
would
dispose
of
his
goods
well
nigh
to
throw
them
away
whereby
he
was
brought
near
unto
ruin
sore
chagrined
at
this
mischance
and
knowing
not
what
to
do
seeing
himself
thus
from
a
very
rich
man
in
brief
space
grown
in
a
manner
poor
he
determined
either
to
die
or
repair
his
losses
by
pillage
so
he
might
not
return
thither
poor
whence
he
had
departed
rich
accordingly
having
found
a
purchaser
for
his
great
ship
with
the
price
thereof
and
that
which
he
had
gotten
of
his
wares
he
bought
a
little
vessel
light
and
apt
for
cruising
and
arming
and
garnishing
it
excellent
well
with
everything
needful
unto
such
a
service
addressed
himself
to
make
his
purchase
of
other
men
goods
and
especially
of
those
of
the
turks
in
this
trade
fortune
was
far
kinder
to
him
than
she
had
been
in
that
of
a
merchant
for
that
in
some
year
space
he
plundered
and
took
so
many
turkish
vessels
that
he
found
he
had
not
only
gotten
him
his
own
again
that
he
had
lost
in
trade
but
had
more
than
doubled
his
former
substance
whereupon
schooled
by
the
chagrin
of
his
former
loss
and
deeming
he
had
enough
he
persuaded
himself
rather
than
risk
a
second
mischance
to
rest
content
with
that
which
he
had
without
seeking
more
accordingly
he
resolved
to
return
therewith
to
his
own
country
and
being
fearful
of
trade
concerned
not
himself
to
employ
his
money
otherwise
but
thrusting
his
oars
into
the
water
set
out
homeward
in
that
same
little
vessel
wherewith
he
had
gained
it
he
had
already
reached
the
archipelago
when
there
arose
one
evening
a
violent
wind
which
was
not
only
contrary
to
his
course
but
raised
so
great
a
sea
that
his
little
vessel
could
not
endure
it
wherefore
he
took
refuge
in
a
bight
of
the
sea
made
by
a
little
island
and
there
abode
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
purposing
there
to
await
better
weather
he
had
not
lain
there
long
when
two
great
genoese
carracks
coming
from
constantinople
made
their
way
with
great
difficulty
into
the
little
harbour
to
avoid
that
from
which
himself
had
fled
the
newcomers
espied
the
little
ship
and
hearing
that
it
pertained
to
landolfo
whom
they
already
knew
by
report
to
be
very
rich
blocked
against
it
the
way
by
which
it
might
depart
and
addressed
themselves
like
men
by
nature
rapacious
and
greedy
of
gain
to
make
prize
of
it
accordingly
they
landed
part
of
their
men
well
harnessed
and
armed
with
crossbows
and
posted
them
on
such
wise
that
none
might
come
down
from
the
bark
an
he
would
not
be
shot
whilst
the
rest
warping
themselves
in
with
small
boats
and
aided
by
the
current
laid

ship
aboard
and
took
it

without
missing
a

they
carried
aboard
one
of
the
carracks
leaving
him
but
a
sorry
doublet
then
taking
everything
out
of
the
ship
they
scuttled

morrow

having
shifted

made
sail
westward
and
fared
on
their
voyage
prosperously
all
that
day
but
towards
evening
there
arose
a
tempestuous
wind
which
made
the

high

from

amidships
broke
all
in

no
otherwise

a

dashed
against

was
in
a
moment
all
full
of
bales
of
merchandise
and
chests
and
planks
that
floated
on
the
surface

wont
to
happen

such
cases

those
who
knew
how

it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
the

was

great
and
swollen
fell
to
laying
hold
of
such
things
as
came
within
their
reach
among
the

the
unfortunate
landolfo
albeit
many
a
time
that
day
he
had
called
for
death
choosing
rather
to
die
than
return
home
poor
as
he
found
himself
seeing
it
near
at
hand
was
fearful
thereof
and
like
the
others
laid
hold
of
a
plank
that
came
to
his
hand

an
he
put
off
drowning

might
send
him
some
means
of
escape
bestriding
this
he
kept
himself
afloat
as
best
he
might
driven
hither
and
thither
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
till
daylight
when
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
nothing
but
clouds
and
sea
and
a
chest
floating
on
the
waves
which
bytimes
to
his
sore
affright
drew
nigh
unto
him
for
that
he
feared
lest
peradventure
it
should
dash
against
him
on
such
wise
as
to
do
him
a
mischief
wherefore
as
often
as
it
came
near
him
he
put
it
away
from
him
as
best
he
might
with
his
hand
albeit
he
had
little
strength
thereof
but
presently
there
issued
a
sudden
flaw
of
wind
out
of
the
air
and
falling
on
the
sea
smote
upon
the
chest
and
drove
it
with
such
violence
against
landolfo
plank
that
the
latter
was
overset
and
he
himself
perforce
went
under
water
however
he
struck
out
and
rising
to
the
surface
aided
more
by
fear
than
by
strength
saw
the
plank
far
removed
from
him
wherefore
fearing
he
might
be
unable
to
reach
it
again
he
made
for
the
chest
which
was
pretty
near
him
and
laying
himself
flat
with
his
breast
on
the
lid
thereof
guided
it
with
his
arms
as
best
he
might

making

bright
with
sand
and
salt
water
seeing

draw
near

discerning
in

drew

crying
out

he
said
nothing

presently

carrying
him
landward
the

descried
the
shape
of
the

and
looking
straitlier
perceived
first
the
arms
outspread
upon
it
and
then
the
face
and
guessed
it
for
that
which
it
was

moved
with

she
entered

into

was
now
calm

seizing
landolfo
by
the
hair
dragged
him
ashore
chest
and
all
there
having
with
difficulty
unclasped
his
hands
from
the
chest
she
set
the
latter
on
the
head
of
a
young
daughter
of
hers
who
was
with
her
and
carried
him
off
as
he
were
a
little
child
to
her
hut
where
she
put
him
in
a
bagnio
and
so
chafed
and
bathed
him
with
warm
water
that
the
strayed
heat
returned
to
him

with
somewhat
of

lost

taking
him
up
out
of

bath
whenas
it
seemed

she
comforted
him
with
somewhat
of
good
wine
and
confections
and
tended
him
some
days
as
best
she
might
till
he
had
recovered
his
strength
and
knew
where
he
was

she
judged
it
time
to
restore
him
his
chest

she
had
kept
safe
for
him
and
to
tell
him
that
he
might
now
prosecute
his
fortune
landolfo
who
had
no
recollection
of
the
chest
yet
took
it
when
the
good
woman
presented
it
to
him
thinking
it
could
not
be
so
little
worth
but
that
it
might
defray
his
expenses
for
some
days
but
finding
it
very
light
was
sore
abated
of
his
hopes
nevertheless
what
while
his
hostess
was
abroad
he
broke
it
open
to
see
what
it
contained
and
found
therein
store
of
precious
stones
both
set
and
unset
he
had
some
knowledge
of
these
matters
and
seeing
them
knew
them
to
be
of
great
value
wherefore
he
praised
god
who
had
not
yet
forsaken
him
and
was
altogether
comforted
however
as
one
who
had
in
brief
space
been
twice
cruelly
baffled
by
fortune
fearing
a
third
misadventure
he
bethought
himself
that
it
behoved
him
use
great
wariness
and
he
would
bring
those
things
home
wherefore
wrapping
them
as
best
he
might
in
some
rags
he
told
the
good
woman
that
he
had
no
more
occasion
for
the
chest
but
that
an
it
pleased
her
she
should
give
him
a
bag
and
take
the
chest
herself
this
she
willingly
did
and
he
having
rendered
her
the
best
thanks
in
his
power
for
the
kindness
received
from
her
shouldered
his
bag
and
going
aboard
a
bark
passed
over
to
brindisi
and
thence
made
his
way
along
the
coast
to
trani
here
he
found
certain
townsmen
of
his
who
were
drapers
and
clad
him
for
the
love
of
god
after
he
had
related
to
them
all
his
adventures
except
that
of
the
chest
nay
more
they
lent
him
a
horse
and
sent
him
under
escort
to
ravello
whither
he
said
he
would
fain
return
there
deeming
himself
in
safety
and
thanking
god
who
had
conducted
him
thither
he
opened
his
bag
and
examining
everything
more
diligently
than
he
had
yet
done
found
he
had
so
many
and
such
stones
that
supposing
he
sold
them
at
a
fair
price
or
even
less
he
was
twice
as
rich
again
as
when
he
departed
thence
then
finding
means
to
dispose
of
his
jewels
he
sent
a
good
sum
of
money
to
corfu

the
good
woman

had
brought
him
forth
of
the
sea
in
requital
of
the
service
received

like

reclothed
him

a
young

a

who
hearing
that
horses
were
good
cheap
at
naples
put
five
hundred
gold
florins
in
his
purse
and
betook
himself
thither
with

having
never

been
away
from

arrived
there
one
sunday
evening
towards
vespers
and
having
taken
counsel
with
his
host
sallied
forth
next
morning
to
the
market
where
he
saw
great
plenty
of
horses
many
of
them
pleased
him
and
he
cheapened
one
and
another

could
not

came
and

and
catching

now
there
was
with
her
an
old
woman
likewise
a
sicilian
who
seeing
andreuccio
let
her
companion
pass
on
and
running
to
him
embraced
him
affectionately
which
when
the
damsel
saw
she
stepped
aside
to
wait
for
her
without
saying
aught
andreuccio
turning
to
the
old
woman
and
recognizing
her
gave
her
a
hearty
greeting
and
she
having
promised
to
visit
him
at
his
inn
took
leave
without
holding
overlong
parley
there
whilst
he
fell
again
to
chaffering
but
bought
nothing
that
morning
the
damsel
who
had
noted
first
andreuccio
purse
and
after
her
old
woman
acquaintance
with
him
began
cautiously
to
enquire
of
the
latter
by
way
of
casting
about
for
a
means
of
coming
at
the
whole
or
part
of
the
money
who
and
whence
he
was
and
what
he
did
there
and
how
she
came
to
know
him
the
old
woman
told
her
every
particular
of
andreuccio
affairs
well
nigh
as
fully
as
he
himself
could
have
done
having
long
abidden
with
his
father
first
in
sicily
and
after
at
perugia
and
acquainted
her
to
boot
where
he
lodged
and
wherefore
he
was
come
thither
the
damsel
being
thus
fully
informed
both
of
his
name
and
parentage
thereby
with
subtle
craft
laid
her
plans
for
giving
effect
to
her
desire
and
returning
home
set
the
old
woman
awork
for
the
rest
of
the
day
so
she
might
not
avail
to
return
to
andreuccio
then
calling
a
maid
of
hers
whom
she
had
right
well
lessoned
unto
such
offices
she
despatched
her
towards
evensong
to
the
inn
where
andreuccio
lodged
as
chance
would
have
it
she
found
him
alone
at
the
door
and
enquired
at
him
of
himself
he
answered
that
he
was
the
man
she
sought
whereupon
she
drew
him
aside
and
said
to
him
an
it
please
you
a
gentlewoman
of
this
city
would
fain
speak
with
you
andreuccio
hearing
this
considered
himself
from
head
to
foot
and
himseeming
he
was
a
handsome
varlet
of
his
person
he
concluded
as
if
there
were
no
other
young
fellow
to
be
found
in
naples
that
the
lady
in
question
must
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
accordingly
he
answered
without
further
deliberation
that
he
was
ready
and
asked
the
girl
when
and
where
the
lady
would
speak
with
him
whereto
she
answered
whenas
it
pleaseth
you
to
come
she
awaiteth
you
in
her
house
and
andreuccio
forthwith
rejoined
without
saying
aught
to
the
people
of
the
inn
thou
on
before
i
will
come
after
thee
thereupon
the
girl
carried
him
to
the
house
of
her
mistress
who
dwelt
in
a
street
called
malpertugio
the
very
name
whereof
denoteth
how
reputable
a
quarter
it
is
but
he
unknowing
neither
suspecting
aught
thereof
and
thinking
to
go
to
most
honourable
place
and
to
a
lady
of
quality
entered
the
house
without
hesitation
preceded
by
the
who
called
her
mistress
and
said
is
andreuccio
and
mounting
the
stair
saw
the
damsel
come
to
the
stairhead
to
receive
him
now
she
was
yet
in
the
prime
of
youth
tall
of
person
with
a
very
fair
face
and
very
handsomely
dressed
and
adorned
as
he
drew
near
her
she
came
down
three
steps
to
meet
him
with
open
arms
and
clasping
him
round
the
neck
abode
awhile
without
speaking
as
if
hindered
by
excess
of
tenderness
then
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
weeping
and
said
in
a
somewhat
broken
voice
my
andreuccio
thou
art
indeed
welcome

ill
hole
he
was
amazed
at
such
tender
caresses
and
answered
all
confounded
you
are
well
met
thereupon
taking
him
by
the
hand
she
carried
him
up
into
her
saloon
and
thence
without
saying
another
word
to
him
she
brought
him
into
her
chamber
which
was
all
redolent
of
roses
and
orange
flowers
and
other
perfumes
here
he
saw
a
very
fine
bed
hung
round
with
curtains
and
store
of
dresses
upon
the
pegs
and
other
very
goodly
and
rich
gear
after
the
usance
of
those
parts
by
reason
whereof
like
a
freshman
as
he
was
he
firmly
believed
her
to
be
no
less
than
a
great
lady
she
made
him
sit
with
her
on
a
chest
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
bespoke
him
thus
i
am
very
certain
thou
marvellest
at
these
caresses
that
i
bestow
on
thee
and
at
my
tears
as
he
may
well
do
who
knoweth
me
not
and
hath
maybe
never
heard
speak
of
me
but
i
have
that
to
tell
thee
which
is
like
to
amaze
thee
yet
more
namely
that
i
am
thy
sister
and
i
tell
thee
that
since
god
hath
vouchsafed
me
to
look

fain
would

my

and
thine
as
i
doubt
not
thou
knowest
abode
long
in
palermo
and
there
for
his
good
humour
and
pleasant
composition
was
and
yet
is
greatly
beloved
of
those
who
knew
him
but
among
all
his
lovers
my
mother
who
was
a
lady
of
gentle
birth
and
then
a
widow
was
she
who
most
affected
him
insomuch
that
laying
aside
the
fear
of
her
father
and
brethren
as
well
as
the
care
of
her
own
honour
she
became
so
private
with
him
that
i
was
born
thereof
and
grew
up
as
thou
seest
me
presently
having
occasion
to
depart
palermo
and
return
to
perugia
he
left
me
a
little
maid
with
my
mother
nor
ever
after
for
all
that
i
could
hear
remembered
him
of
me
or
her
whereof
were
he
not
my
father
i
should
blame
him
sore
having
regard
to
the
ingratitude
shown
by
him
to
my
mother
to
say
nothing
of
the
love
it
behoved
him
bear
me
as
his
daughter
born
of
no
nor
woman
of
mean
extraction
who
had
moved
by
very
faithful
love
without
anywise
knowing
who
he
might
be
committed
into
his
hands
her
possessions
and
herself
no
less
but
what
skilleth
it
things
ill
done
and
long
time
passed

easier
blamed
than

so
it
was
he
left
me
a
little
child
in

where
being
grown
well
nigh
as
i
am
now
my
mother
who
was
a
rich

gave
me
to

to
a
worthy
gentleman
of
girgenti
who
for
her
love
and
mine
came
to
abide
at
palermo
and
there
being
a
great
guelph
he
entered
into
treaty
with
our
king
charles
which
being
discovered
by
king
frederick
ere

could
be
given
to
it

the
occasion
of
our
being
enforced
to
flee
from
sicily

i
looked
to
be
the
greatest
lady

ever
in
the
island

taking
such
few
things
as
we
might
i
say
few
in
respect
of
the
many
we
had
and
leaving
our
lands

we
took
refuge
in

mindful
of

in

andreuccio
hearing
this
fable
so
orderly
so
artfully
delivered
by
the
damsel
without
ever
stammering
or
faltering
for
a
word
and
remembering
it
to
be
true
that
his
father
had
been
in
palermo
knowing
moreover
by
himself
the
fashions
of
young
men
and
how
lightly
they
fall
in
love
in
their
youth
and
seeing
the
affectionate
tears
and
embraces
and
the
chaste
kisses
that
she
lavished
on
him
held
all
she
told
him
for
more
than
true
wherefore
as
soon
as
she
was
silent
he
answered
her
saying
it
should
seem
to
you
no
very
great
matter
if
i
marvel
for
that
in
truth
whether
it
be
that
my
father
for
whatsoever
reason
never
spoke
of
your
mother
nor
of
yourself
or
that
if
he
did
it
came
not
to
my
notice
i
had
no
more
knowledge
of
you
than
if
you
had
never
been
and
so
much
the
dearer
is
it
to
me
to
find
you
my
sister
here
as
i
am
alone
in
this
city
and
the
less
expected
this
indeed
i
know
no
man
of
so
high
a
condition
that
you
should
not
be
dear
to
him
to
say
nothing
of
myself
who
am
but
a
petty
trader
but
i
pray
you
make
me
clear
of
one
thing
how
knew
you
that
i
was
here
whereto
she
made
answer
poor
woman
who
much
frequenteth
me
gave
me
this
morning
to
know
of
thy
coming
for
that
as
she
telleth
me
she
abode
long
with
our
father
both
at
palermo
and
at
perugia
and
but
that
meseemed
it
was
a
more
reputable
thing
that
thou
shouldst
visit
me
in
my
own
house
than
i
thee
in
that
of
another
i
had
come
to
thee
this
great
while
agone
after
this
she
proceeded
to
enquire
more
particularly
of
all
his
kinsfolk
by
name
and
he
answered
her
of
all
giving
the
more
credence
by
reason
of
this
to
that
which
it
the
less
behoved
him
to
believe
the
talk
being
long
and
the
heat
great
she
called
for
greek
wine
and
confections
and
let
give
andreuccio
to
drink
after
which
he
would
have
taken
leave
for
that
it
was
but
she
would
on
no
wise
suffer
it
and
making
a
show
of
being
sore
vexed
embraced
him
and
said
woe
is
me
i
see
but
too
clearly
how
little
dear
i
am
to
thee
who
would
believe
that
thou
couldst
be
with
a
sister
of
thine
whom
thou
hast
never
yet
seen
and
in
whose
house
thou
shouldst
have
lighted
down
whenas
thou
earnest
hither
and
offer
to
leave
her
to
go
sup
at
the
inn
indeed
thou
shalt
sup
with
me
and
albeit
my
husband
is
abroad
which
grieveth
me
mightily
i
shall
know
well
how
to
do
thee
some
little
honour
such
as
a
woman
may
to
which
andreuccio
unknowing
what
else
he
should
say
answered
hold
you
as
dear
as
a
sister
should
be
held
but
an
i
go
not
i
shall
be
expected
to
supper
all
the
evening
and
shall
do
an
unmannerliness
be
god
cried
she
would
think
i
had
no
one
in
the
house
to
send
to
tell
them
not
to
expect
thee
albeit
thou
wouldst
do
much
greater
courtesy
and
indeed
but
thy
duty
an
thou
sentest
to
bid
thy
companions
come
hither
to
supper
and
after
am
thou
must
begone
you
might
all
go
away
together
andreuccio
replied
that
he
had
no
desire
for
his
companions
that
evening
but
that
since
it
was
agreeable
to
her
she
might
do
her
pleasure
of
him
accordingly
she
made
a
show
of
sending
to
the
inn
to
say
that
he
was
not
to
be
expected
to
supper
and
after
much
other
discourse
they
sat
down
to
supper
and
were
sumptuously
served
with
various
meats
whilst
she
adroitly
contrived
to
prolong
the
repast
till
it
was
dark
night
then
when
they
rose
from
table
and
andreuccio
would
have
taken
his
leave
she
declared
that
she
would
on
no
wise
suffer
this
for
that
naples
was
no
place
to
go
about
in
by
night
especially
for
a
stranger
and
that
whenas
she
sent
to
the
inn
to
say
that
he
was
not
to
be
expected
to
supper
she
had
at
the
same
time
given
notice
that
he
would
lie
abroad
andreuccio
believing
this
and
taking
pleasure
in
being
with
her
beguiled
as
he
was
by
false
credence
abode
where
he
was
and
after
supper
they
held
much
and
long
discourse
not
without
reason
till
a
part
of
the
night
was
past
when
she
withdrew
with
her
women
into
another
room
leaving
andreuccio
in
her
own
chamber
with
a
little
lad
to
wait
upon
him
if
he
should
lack
aught
footnote
the
reason
was
that
she
wished
to
keep
him
in
play
till
late
into
the
night
when
all
the
folk
should
be
asleep
and
she
might
the
lightlier
deal
with
him
the
heat
being
great
andreuccio
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
alone
stripped
to
his
doublet
and
putting
off
his
hosen
laid
them
at
the
bedhead
after
which
natural
use
soliciting
him
to
rid
himself
of
the
overmuch
burden
of
his
stomach
he
asked
the
boy
where
this
might
be
done
who
showed
him
a
door
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
said
in
there
accordingly
he
opened
the
door
and
passing
through
in
all
assurance
chanced
to
set
foot
on
a
plank
which
being
broken
loose
from
the
joist
at
the
opposite
end
flew
up
and
down
they
went
plank
and
man
together
god
so
favoured
him
that
he
did
himself
no
hurt
in
the
fall
albeit
he
fell
from
some
height
but
he
was
all
bemired
with
the
ordure
whereof
the
place
was
full
and
in
order
that
you
may
the
better
apprehend
both
that
which
hath
been
said
and
that
which
ensueth
i
will
show
you
how
the
place
lay
there
were
in
a
narrow
alley
such
as
we
often
see
between
two
houses
a
pair
of
rafters
laid
from
one
house
to
another
and
thereon
sundry
boards
nailed
and
the
place
of
session
set
up
of
which
boards
that
which
gave
way
with
andreuccio
was
one
finding
himself
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
alley
and
sore
chagrined
at
the
mishap
he
fell
for
the
boy
but
the
latter
as
soon
as
he
heard
him
fall
had
run
to
tell
his
mistress
who
hastened
to
his
chamber
and
searching
hurriedly
if
his
clothes
were
there
found
them
and
with
them
the
money
which
in
his
mistrust
he
still
foolishly
carried
about
him
having
now
gotten
that
for
which
feigning
herself
of
palermo
and
sister
to
a
perugian
she
had
set
her
snare
she
took
no
more
reck
of
him
but
hastened
to
shut
the
door
whereby
he
had
gone
out
when
he
fell
andreuccio
getting
no
answer
from
the
boy
proceeded
to
call
loudlier
but
to
no
purpose
whereupon
his
suspicions
being
now
aroused
he
began
too
late
to
smoke
the
cheat
accordingly
he
scrambled
over
a
low
wall
that
shut
off
the
alley
from
the
street
and
letting
himself
down
into
the
road
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
house
which
he
knew
very
well
and
there
called
long
and
loud
and
shook
and
beat
upon
it
amain
but
all
in
vain
wherefore
bewailing
himself
as
one
who
was
now
fully
aware
of
his
mischance
woe
is
me
cried
he
how
little
time
have
i
lost
five
hundred
florins
and
a
sister
then
after
many
other
words
he
fell
again
to
battering
the
door
and
crying
out
and
this
he
did
so
long
and
so
lustily
that
many
of
the
neighbours
being
awakened
and
unable
to
brook
the
annoy
arose
and
one
of
the
courtezan
coming
to
the
window
apparently
all
said
peevishly
knocketh
below
there
cried
andreuccio
thou
not
know
me
i
am

to

whereto
quoth

an
thou

tales

replied
andreuccio
knowest
not
what
i
mean
certes
thou
knowest
but
if
sicilian
kinships
be
of
such
a
fashion
that
they
are
forgotten
in
so
short
a
time
at

give
me
back
my
clothes
and
i
will
begone
with

man
rejoined
she
as
if
laughing
thou
dreamest
and
to
say
this
and
to
draw
in
her
head
and
shut
the
window
were
one
and
the
same
thing
whereat
andreuccio
now
fully
certified
of
his
loss
was
like
for
chagrin
to
turn
his
exceeding
anger
into
madness
and
bethought
himself
to
seek
to
recover
by
violence
that
which
he
might
not
have
again
with
words
wherefore
taking
up
a
great
stone
he
began
anew
to
batter
the
door
more
furiously
than
ever
at
this
many
of
the
neighbours
who
had
already
been
awakened
and
had
arisen
deeming
him
some
pestilent
fellow
who
had
trumped
up
this
story
to
spite
the
woman
of
the
house
and
provoked
at
the
knocking
he
kept
up
came
to
the
windows
and
began
to
say
no
otherwise
than
as
all
the
dogs
of
a
quarter
bark
after
a
strange
dog
a
villainous
shame
to
come
at
this
hour
to
decent
women
houses
and
tell
these
stories
for
god
sake
good
man
please
you
begone
in
peace
and
let
us
sleep
an
thou
have
aught
to
mell
with
her
come
back
and
spare
us
this
annoy
taking
assurance
perchance
by
these
words
there
came
to
the
window
one
who
was
within
the
house
a
bully
of
the
gentlewoman
whom
andreuccio
had
as
yet
neither
heard
nor
seen
and
said
in
a
terrible
big
rough
voice
is
below
there
andreuccio
hearing
this
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
at
the
window
one
who
by
what
little
he
could
make
out
himseemed
should
be
a
very
masterful
fellow
with
a
bushy
black
beard
on
his
face
and
who
yawned
and
rubbed
his
eyes
as
he
had
arisen
from
bed
or
deep
sleep
whereupon
not
without
fear
he
answered
am
a
brother
of
the
lady
of
the
house
the
other
waited
not
for
him
to
make
an
end
of
his
reply
but
said
more
fiercely
than
before
know
not
what
hindereth
me
from
coming
down
and
cudgelling
thee
what
while
i
see
thee
stir
for
a
pestilent
drunken
ass
as
thou
must
be
who
will
not
let
us
sleep
this
night
then
drawing
back
into
the
house
he
shut
the
window
whereupon
certain
of
the
neighbours
who
were
better
acquainted
with
the
fellow
quality
said
softly
to
andreuccio
god
sake
good
man
begone
in
peace
and
abide
not
there
to
be
slain
get
thee
gone
for
thine
own
good
andreuccio
terrified
at
the
fellow
voice
and
aspect
and
moved
by
the
exhortations
of
the
neighbours
who
seemed
to
him
to
speak
out
of
charity
set
out
to
return
to
his
inn
in
the
direction
of
the
quarter
whence
he
had
followed
the
maid
without
knowing
whither
to
go
despairing
of
his
money
and
woebegone
as
ever
man
was
being
loathsome
to
himself
for
the
stench
that
came
from
him
and
thinking
to
repair
to
the
sea
to
wash
himself
he
turned
to
the
left
and
followed
a
street
called
ruga
catalana
that
led
towards
the
upper
part
of
the
city
presently
he
espied
two
men
coming
towards
him
with
a
lantern
and
fearing
they
might
be
officers
of
the
watch
or
other
folk
he
stealthily
took
refuge
to
avoid
them
in
a
hovel
that
he
saw
hard
by
but
they
as
of
malice
aforethought
made
straight
for
the
same
place
and
entering
in
began
to
examine
certain
irons
which
one
of
them
laid
from
off
his
shoulder
discoursing
various
things
thereof
the
while
footnote
catalan
street
presently
meaneth
this
quoth
one
smell
the
worst
stench
meseemeth
i
ever
smelt
so
saying
he
raised
the
lantern
and
seeing
the
wretched
andreuccio
enquired
in
amazement
is
there
andreuccio
made
no
answer
but
they
came
up
to
him
with
the
light
and
asked
him
what
he
did
there
in
such
a
pickle
whereupon
he
related
to
them
all
that
had
befallen
him
and
they
conceiving
where
this
might
have
happened
said
one
to
the
other
this
must
have
been
in
the
house
of
scarabone
buttafuocco
then
turning
to
him
man
quoth
one
thou
hast
lost
thy
money
thou
hast
much
reason
to
praise
god
that
this
mischance
betided
thee
so
that
thou
fellest
nor
couldst
after
avail
to
enter
the
house
again
for
hadst
thou
not
fallen
thou
mayst
be
assured
that
when
once
thou
wast
fallen
asleep
thou
hadst
been
knocked
on
the
head
and
hadst
lost
thy
life
as
well
as
thy
money
but
what
booteth
it
now
to
repine
thou
mayst
as
well
look
to
have
the
stars
out
of
the
sky
as
to
recover
a
farthing
of
thy
money
nay
thou
art
like
to
be
murdered
should
yonder
fellow
hear
that
thou
makest
any
words
thereof
then
they
consulted
together
awhile
and
presently
said
to
him
you
we
are
moved
to
pity
for
thee
wherefore
an
thou
wilt
join
with
us
in
somewhat
we
go
about
to
do
it
seemeth
to
us
certain
that
there
will
fall
to
thee
for
thy
share
much
more
than
the
value
of
that
which
thou
hast
lost
whereupon
andreuccio
in
his
desperation
answered
that
he
was
ready
now
there
had
been
that
day
buried
an
archbishop
of
naples
by
name
messer
filippo
minutolo
and
he
had
been
interred
in
his
richest
ornaments
and
with
a
ruby
on
his
finger
worth
more
than
five
hundred
florins
of
gold
him
they
were
minded
to
despoil
and
this
their
intent
they
discovered
to
andreuccio
who
more
covetous
than
set
out
with
them
for
the
cathedral
as
they
went
andreuccio
still
stinking
amain
one
of
the
thieves
said
we
not
find
means
for
this
fellow
to
wash
himself
a
little
be
it
where
it
may
so
he
may
not
stink
so
terribly
can
we
answered
the
other
are
here
near
a
well
where
there
useth
to
be
a
rope
and
pulley
and
a
great
bucket
let
us
go
thither
and
we
will
wash
him
in
a
trice
accordingly
they
made
for
the
well
in
question
and
found
the
rope
there
but
the
bucket
had
been
taken
away
wherefore
they
took
counsel
together
to
tie
him
to
the
rope
and
let
him
down
into
the
well
so
he
might
wash
himself
there
charging
him
shake
the
rope
as
soon
as
he
was
clean
and
they
would
pull
him
up
hardly
had
they
let
him
down
when
as
chance
would
have
it
certain
of
the
watch
being
athirst
for
the
heat
and
with
running
after
some
rogue
or
another
came
to
the
well
to
drink
and
the
two
rogues
setting
eyes
on
them
made
off
incontinent
before
the
officers
saw
them
presently
andreuccio
having
washed
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
shook
the
rope
and
the
thirsty
officers
laying
by
their
targets
and
arms
and
surcoats
began
to
haul
upon
the
rope
thinking
the
bucket
full
of
water
at
the
other
end
as
soon
as
andreuccio
found
himself
near
the
top
he
let
go
the
rope
and
laid
hold
of
the
marge
with
both
hands
which
when
the
officers
saw
overcome
with
sudden
affright
they
dropped
the
rope
without
saying
a
word
and
took
to
their
heels
as
quickliest
they
might
at
this
andreuccio
marvelled
sore
and
but
that
he
had
fast
hold
of
the
marge
would
have
fallen
to
the
bottom
to
his
no
little
hurt
or
maybe
death
however
he
made
his
way
out
and
finding
the
arms
which
he
knew
were
none
of
his
companions
bringing
he
was
yet
more
amazed
but
knowing
not
what
to
make
of
it
and
misdoubting
some
snare
he
determined
to
begone
without
touching
aught
and
accordingly
made
off
he
knew
not
whither
bewailing
his
as
he
went
he
met
his
two
comrades
who
came
to
draw
him
forth
of
the
well
and
when
they
saw
him
they
marvelled
exceedingly
and
asked
him
who
had
drawn
him
up
andreuccio
replied
that
he
knew
not
and
told
them
orderly
how
it
had
happened
and
what
he
had
found
by
the
wellside
whereupon
the
others
perceiving
how
the
case
stood
told
him
laughing
why
they
had
fled
and
who
these
were
that
had
pulled
him
up
then
without
farther
parley
it
being
now
middle
night
they
repaired
to
the
cathedral
and
making
their
way
thereinto
lightly
enough
went
straight
to
the
archbishop
tomb
which
was
of
marble
and
very
large
with
their
irons
they
raised
the
lid
which
was
very
heavy
and
propped
it
up
so
as
a
man
might
enter
which
being
done
quoth
one
shall
go
in
i
answered
the
other
i
rejoined
his
fellow
andreuccio
enter
will
i
not
said
the
latter
whereupon
the
two
rogues
turned
upon
him
and
said
thou
wilt
not
cock
faith
an
thou
enter
not
we
will
clout
thee
over
the
costard
with
one
of
these
iron
bars
till
thou
fall
dead
andreuccio
affrighted
crept
into
the
tomb
saying
in
himself
the
while
fellows
will
have
me
go
in
here
so
they
may
cheat
me
for
that
when
i
shall
have
given
them
everything
they
will
begone
about
their
business
whilst
i
am
labouring
to
win
out
of
the
tomb
and
i
shall
abide
accordingly
he
determined
to
make
sure
of
his
share
beforehand
wherefore
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
bottom
calling
to
mind
the
precious
ring
whereof
he
had
heard
them
speak
he
drew
it
from
the
archbishop
finger
and
set
it
on
his
own
then
he
passed
them
the
crozier
and
mitre
and
gloves
and
stripping
the
dead
man
to
his
shirt
gave
them
everything
saying
that
there
was
nothing
more
the
others
declared
that
the
ring
must
be
there
and
bade
him
seek
everywhere
but
he
replied
that
he
found
it
not
and
making
a
show
of
seeking
it
kept
them
in
play
awhile
at
last
the
two
rogues
who
were
no
less
wily
than
himself
bidding
him
seek
well
the
while
took
occasion
to
pull
away
the
prop
that
held
up
the
lid
and
made
off
leaving
him
shut
in
the
tomb
what
became
of
andreuccio
when
he
found
himself
in
this
plight
you
may
all
imagine
for
yourselves
he
strove
again
and
again
to
heave
up
the
lid
with
his
head
and
shoulders
but
only
wearied
himself
in
vain
wherefore
overcome
with
chagrin
and
despair
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
upon
the
archbishop
dead
body
and
whoso
saw
him
there
had
hardly
known
which
was
the
deader
the
prelate
or
he
presently
coming
to
himself
he
fell
into
a
passion
of
weeping
seeing
he
must
there
without
fail
come
to
one
of
two
ends
to
wit
either
he
must
if
none
came
thither
to
open
the
tomb
again
die
of
hunger
and
stench
among
the
worms
of
the
dead
body
or
if
any
came
and
found
him
there
he
would
certainly
be
hanged
for
a
thief
as
he
abode
in
this
mind
exceeding
woebegone
he
heard
folk
stirring
in
the
church
and
many
persons
speaking
and
presently
perceived
that
they
came
to
do
that
which
he
and
his
comrades
had
already
done
whereat
fear
redoubled
upon
him
but
after
the
newcomers
had
forced
open
the
tomb
and
propped
up
the
lid
they
fell
into
dispute
of
who
should
go
in
and
none
was
willing
to
do
it
however
after
long
parley
a
priest
said
fear
ye
think
you
he
will
eat
you
the
dead
eat
not
men
i
will
go
in
myself
so
saying
he
set
his
breast
to
the
marge
of
the
tomb
and
turning
his
head
outward
put
in
his
legs
thinking
to
let
himself
drop
andreuccio
seeing
this
started
up
and
catching
the
priest
by
one
of
his
legs
made
a
show
of
offering
to
pull
him
down
into
the
tomb
the
other
feeling
this
gave
a
terrible
screech
and
flung
precipitately
out
of
the
tomb
whereupon
all
the
others
fled
in
terror
as
they
were
pursued
by
an
hundred
thousand
devils
leaving
the
tomb
open
andreuccio
seeing
this
scrambled
hastily
out
of
the
tomb
rejoiced
beyond
all
hope
and
made
off
out
of
the
church
by
the
way
he
had
entered
in
the
day
now
drawing
near
he
fared
on
at
a
venture
with
the
ring
on
his
finger
till
he
came
to
the
and
thence
made
his
way
back
to
his
inn
where
he
found
his
comrades
and
the
host
who
had
been
in
concern
for
him
all
that
night
he
told
them
what
had
betided
him
and
themseemed
by
the
host

that

that
as

there
came
up

unobserved

having
made
an

diurnal
lamentation
returned
to
the
as
she
was
used
to
do
to
visit
her
children
but
found
none
there
whereat
she
first
marvelled
and
after
suddenly
misdoubting
her
of
that
which
had
happened
cast
her
eyes
out
to
sea
and
saw
the
galley
at
no
great
distance
towing
the
little
ship
after
it
whereby
she
knew
but
too
well
that
she
had
lost
her
children
as
well
as
her
husband
and
seeing
herself
there
poor
and
desolate
and
forsaken
unknowing
where
she
should
ever
again
find
any
of
them
she
fell
down
aswoon
upon
the
strand
calling
upon
her
husband
and
her
children
there
was
none
there
to
recall
her
distracted
spirits
with
cold
water
or
other
remedy
wherefore
they
might
at
their
leisure
go
wandering
whither
it
pleased
them
but
after
awhile
the
lost
senses
returning
to
her
wretched
body
in
company
with
tears
and
lamentations
she
called
long
upon
her
children
and
went
a
great
while
seeking
them
in
every
cavern
at
last
finding
all
her
labour
in
vain
and
seeing
the
night
coming
on
she
began
hoping
and
knowing
not
what
to
be
careful
for
herself
and
departing
the
returned
to
the
cavern
where
she
was
wont
to
weep
and
bemoan
herself
she
passed
the
night
in
great
fear
and
inexpressible
dolour
and
the
new
day
being
come
and
the
hour
of
tierce
past
she
was
fain
constrained
by
hunger
for
that
she
had
not
supped
overnight
to
browse
upon
herbs
and
having
fed
as
best
she
might
she
gave
herself
weeping
to
various
thoughts
of
her
future
life
pondering
thus
she
saw
a
enter
a
cavern
hard
by
and
presently
issue
thence
and
betake
herself
into
the
wood
whereupon
she
arose
and
entering
whereas
the
goat
had
come
forth
found
there
two
little
kidlings
born
belike
that
same
day
which
seemed
to
her
the
quaintest
and
prettiest
things
in
the
world
her
milk
being
yet
undried
from
her
recent
delivery
she
tenderly
took
up
the
kids
and
set
them
to
her
breast
they
refused
not
the
service
but
sucked
her
as
if
she
had
been
their
dam
and
thenceforth
made
no
distinction
between
the
one
and
the
other
wherefore
herseeming
she
had
found
some
company
in
that
desert
place
and
growing
no
less
familiar
with
the
old
goat
than
with
her
little
ones
she
resigned
herself
to
live
and
die
there
and
abode
eating
of
herbs
and
drinking
water
and
weeping
as
often
as
she
remembered
her
of
her
husband
and
children
and
of
her
past
life
the
gentle
lady
thus
grown
a
wild
creature
abiding
on
this
wise
it
befell
after
some
months
that
there
came
on
like
wise
to
the
place
whither
she
had
aforetime
been
driven
by
stress
of
weather
a
little
vessel
from
pisa
and
there
abode
some
days
on

this

was
a
gentleman
named
currado
of
the
family
of
the
marquises
of
malespina
who
with
his
wife
a
lady
of
worth
and
piety
was
on
his
return
home
from
a
pilgrimage
to
all
the
holy
places
that
be
in
the
kingdom
of
apulia
to
pass
away
the
time
currado
set
out
one
day
with
his
lady
and
certain
of
his
servants
and
his
dogs
to
go
about
the
island
and
not

the

started
the
two
kids
which
were
now
grown
pretty
big
as
they
went
grazing
the
latter
chased
by
the
dogs
fled
to
no
other
place
but
into
the
cavern
where
was
madam
beritola
who
seeing
this
started
to
her
feet
and
catching
up
a
staff
beat
off
the
dogs
currado
and
his
wife
who
came
after
them
seeing
the
lady
who
was
grown
swart
and
lean
and
hairy
marvelled
and
she
yet
more
at
them
but
after
currado
had
at
her
instance
called
off
his
dogs
they
prevailed
with
her
by
dint
of
much
entreaty
to
tell
them
who
she
was
and
what
she
did
there
whereupon
she
fully
discovered
to
them
her
whole
condition
and
all
that
had
befallen
her
together
with
her
firm
resolution
to
abide
alone
in
the
island
currado
who
had
know
arrighetto
capece
very
well
hearing
this
wept
for
pity
and
did
his
utmost
to
divert
her
with
words
from
so
barbarous
a
purpose
offering
to
carry
her
back
to
her
own
house
or
to
keep
her
with
himself
holding
her
in
such
honour
as
his
sister
until
god
should
send
her
happier
fortune
the
lady
not
yielding
to
these
proffers
currado
left
his
wife
with
her
bidding
the
latter
cause
bring
thither
to
eat
and
clothe
the
lady
who
was
all
in
rags
with
some
of
her
own
apparel
and
charging
her
contrive
by
whatsoever
means
to
bring
her
away
with
her
accordingly
the
gentle
lady
being
left
with
madam
beritola
after
condoling
with
her
amain
of
her
misfortunes
sent
for
raiment
and
victual
and
prevailed
on
her
with
all
the
pains
in
the
world
to
don
the
one
and
eat
the
other
ultimately
after
many
prayers
madam
beritola
protesting
that
she
would
never
consent
to
go
whereas
she
might
be
known
she
persuaded
her
to
go
with
her
into
lunigiana

with
the
two
kids
and
their
dam
which
latter
were
meantime
returned
and
had
greeted
her
with

the
no

wonderment
of
the
gentlewoman
accordingly
as
soon
as
fair

was
come
madam
beritola
embarked
with
currado
and
his
lady
in
their

carrying
with
her
the

and
the
on
whose
account
her
name
being

unknown
she
was

came

to

landed

madam

abode

she

comforted
herself
as

might

bethought

should
the

on

lasted
several

they
pushed
on
among

leaving

they
laid
themselves
down

place
full

the

after
by

chagrined
beyond

at
this
sight
without
saying
aught

had
them
both
seized
by
three
of

and
carried
in

apprehended
his

towards

hastened

not
run
madly
to
make
himself
in

the
murderer

i
purpose
an
thou
thyself
be
willing
to
put
an
end
to
thy
tribulations
and
relieving
thee
from
the
misery
and
duresse
wherein
thou
abidest
to
reinstate
at
once
thine
honour
and
mine
own
in
their
due
stead
as
thou
knowest
spina

thou
hast

a
fashion
misbeseeming

thyself

her

dowry

for
her
manners

her
father
and
mother
thou
knowest
them
and
of
thy
present
state
i
say
nothing
wherefore
an
thou
will
i
purpose
that
whereas
she
hath
unlawfully
been
thy
mistress
she
shall
now
lawfully
become
thy
wife
and
that
thou
shalt
abide
here
with
me
and
with
her

my
very
son
so

now
prison
had
mortified
giannotto
flesh
but
had
nothing
abated
the
generous
spirit
which
he
derived
from
his
noble
birth
nor
yet
the
entire
affection
he
bore
his
mistress
and
albeit
he
ardently
desired
that
which
currado
proffered
him
and
saw
himself
in
the
power
yet
no
whit
did
he
dissemble
of
that
which
the
greatness
of
his
soul
prompted
him
to
say
wherefore
he
answered
neither
lust
of
lordship
nor
greed
of
gain
nor
other
cause
whatever
hath
ever
made
me
lay
snares
for
thy
life
or
thy
good
i
loved
and
love
thy
daughter
and
still
shall
love
her
for
that
i
hold
her
worthy
of
my
love
and
if
i
dealt
with
her
less
than
honourably
in
the
opinion
of
the
vulgar
my
sin
was
one
which
still
goeth
hand
in
hand
with
youth
and
which
an
you
would
do
away
it
behoveth
you
first
do
away
with
youth
moreover
it
is
an
offence
which
would
the
old
but
remember
them
of
having
been
young
and
measure
the
defaults
of
others
by
their
own
and
their
own
by
those
of
others
would
show
less
grievous
than
thou
and
many
others
make
it
and
as
a
friend
and
not
as
an
enemy
i
committed
it
this
that
thou
profferest
me
i
have
still
desired
and
had
i
thought
it
should
be
vouchsafed
me
i
had
long
since
sought
it
and
so
much
the
dearer
will
it
now
be
to
me
as
my
hope
thereof
was
less
if
then
thou
have
not
that
intent
which
thy
words
denote
feed
me
not
with
vain
hope
but
restore
me
to
prison
and
there
torment
me
as
thou
wilt
for
so
long
as
i
love
spina
even
so
for
the
love
of
her
shall
i
still
love
thee
whatsoever
thou
dost
with
me
and
have
thee
in
reverence
currado
hearing
this
marvelled
and
held
him
great
of
soul
and
his
love
fervent
and
tendered
him
therefore
the
dearer
wherefore
rising
to
his
feet
he
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
and
without
more
delay
bade
privily
bring
spina
thither
accordingly
the
lady
who
was
grown
lean
and
pale
and
weakly
in
prison
and
showed
well
nigh
another
than
she
was
wont
to
be
as
on
like
wise
giannotto
another
man
being
come
the
two
lovers
in
currado
presence
with
one
consent
contracted
marriage
according
to
our
usance
then
after
some
days
during
which
he
had
let
furnish
the
pair
with
all
that
was
necessary
or
agreeable
to
them
he
deemed
it
time
to
gladden
their
mothers
with
the
good
news
and
accordingly
calling
his
lady
and
cavriuola
he
said
to
the
latter
would
you
say
madam
an
i
should
cause
you
have
again
your
elder
son
as
the
husband
of
one
of
my
daughters
whereto
she
answered
that
i
can
say
to
you
no
otherwhat
than
that
could
i
be
more
beholden
to
you
than
i
am
i
should
be
so
much
the
more
so
as
you
would
have
restored
to
me
that
which
is
dearer
to
me
than
mine
own
self
and
restoring
it
to
me
on
such
wise
as
you
say
you
would
in
some
measure
in
me
my
lost
hope
with
this
she
held
her
peace
weeping
and
currado
said
to
his
lady
thou
mistress
how
wouldst
thou
take
it
were
i
to
present
thee
with
such
a
the
lady
replied
a
common
churl
so
he
pleased
you
would
please
me
let
alone
one
of
these
who
are
men
of
gentle
birth
said
currado
hope
ere
many
days
to
make
you
happy
women

this

beritola
sons
accordingly
seeing
the
two
young
folk
now
restored
to
their
former
cheer
he
clad
them
sumptuously
and
said
to
giusfredi
it
not
dear
to
thee
over
and
above
thy
present
joyance
an
thou
sawest
thy
mother
here
whereto
he
answered
dare
not
flatter
myself
that
the
chagrin
of
her
unhappy
chances
can
have
left
her
so
long
alive
but
were
it
indeed
so
it
were
dear
to
me
above
all
more
by
token
that
methinketh
i
might
yet
by
her
counsel
avail
to
recover
great
part
of
my
estate
in
sicily
thereupon
currado
sent
for
both
the
ladies
who
came
and
made
much
of
the
wife
no
little
wondering
what
happy
inspiration
it
could
have
been
that
prompted
currado
to
such
exceeding
complaisance
as
he
had
shown
in
joining
giannotto
with
her
in
marriage
madam
beritola
by
reason
of
the
words
she
had
heard
from
currado
began
to
consider
giannotto
and
some
remembrance
of
the
boyish
lineaments
of
her
son
countenance
being
by
occult
virtue
awakened
in
her
without
awaiting
farther
explanation
she
ran
to
cast
herself
upon
his
neck
nor
did
overabounding
emotion
and
maternal
joy
suffer
her
to
say
a
word
nay
they
so
locked
up
all
her
senses
that
she
fell
into
her
son
arms
as
if
dead
the
latter
albeit
he
was
sore
amazed
remembering
to
have
many
times
before
seen
her
in
that
same
castle
and
never
recognized
her
nevertheless
knew
incontinent
the
maternal
odour
and
blaming
himself
for
his
past
heedlessness
received
her
weeping
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
tenderly
after
awhile
madam
beritola
being
affectionately
tended
by
currado
lady
and
spina
and
plied
both
with
cold
water
and
other
remedies
recalled
her
strayed
senses
and
embracing
her
son
anew
full
of
maternal
tenderness
with
many
tears
and
many
tender
words
kissed
him
a
thousand
times
whilst
he
all
reverently
beheld
and
entreated
her
after
these
joyful
and
honourable
greetings
had
been
thrice
or
four
times
repeated
to
the
no
small
contentment
of
the
bystanders
and
they
had
related
unto
each
other
all
that
had
befallen
them
currado
now
to
the
exceeding
satisfaction
of
all
signified
to
his
friends
the
new
alliance
made
by
him
and
gave
ordinance
for
a
goodly
and
magnificent
entertainment
then
said
giusfredi
to
him
you
have
made
me
glad
of
many
things
and
have
long
honourably
entertained
my
mother
and
now
that
no
whit
may
remain
undone
of
that
which
it
is
in
your
power
to
do
i
pray
you
gladden
my
mother
and
and
myself
with
the
presence
of
my
brother
whom
messer
guasparrino
holdeth
in
servitude
in
his
house
and
whom
as
i
have
already
told
you
he
took
with
me
in
one
of
his
cruises
moreover
i
would
have
you
send
into
sicily
one
who
shall
thoroughly
inform
himself
of
the
state
and
condition
of
the
country
and
study
to
learn
what
is
come
of
arrighetto
my
father
an
he
be
alive
or
dead
and
if
he
be
alive
in
what
estate
of
all
which
having
fully
certified
himself
let
him
return
to
us
giusfredi
request
was
pleasing
to
currado
and
without
any
delay
he
despatched
very
discreet
persons
both
to
genoa
and
to
sicily
he
who
went
to
genoa
there
sought
out
messer
guasparrino
and
instantly
besought
him
on
currado
part
to
send
him
scacciato
and
his
nurse
orderly
recounting
to
him
all
his
lord
dealings
with
giusfredi
and
his
mother
messer
guasparrino
marvelled
exceedingly
to
hear
this
and
said
is
it
i
would
do
all
i
may
to
pleasure
currado
and
i
have
indeed
these
fourteen
years
had
in
my
house
the
boy
thou
seekest
and
one
his
mother
both
of
whom
i
will
gladly
send
him
but
do
thou
bid
him
on
my
part
beware
of
lending
overmuch
credence
to
the
fables
of
giannotto
who
nowadays
styleth
himself
giusfredi
for
that
he
is
a
far
greater
knave
than
he
deemeth
so
saying
he
caused
honourably
entertain
the
gentleman
and
sending
privily
for
the
nurse
questioned
her
shrewdly
touching
the
matter
now
she
had
heard
of
the
sicilian
revolt
and
understood
arrighetto
to
be
alive
wherefore
casting
off
her
former
fears
she
told
him
everything
in
order
and
showed
him
the
reasons
that
had
moved
her
to
do
as
she
had
done
messer
guasparrino
finding
her
tale
to
accord
perfectly
with
that
of
currado
messenger
began
to
give
credit
to
the
latter
words
and
having
by
one
means
and
another
like
a
very
astute
man
as
he
was
made
enquiry
of
the
matter
and
happening
hourly
upon
things
that
gave
him
more
and
more
assurance
of
the
fact
took
shame
to
himself
of
his
mean
usage
of
the
lad
in
amends
whereof
knowing
what
arrighetto
had
been
and
was
he
gave
him
to
wife
a
fair
young
daughter
of
his
eleven
years
of
age
with
a
great
dowry
then
after
making
a
great
thereon
he
embarked
with
the
boy
and
girl
and
messenger
and
the
nurse
in
a
galliot
and
betook
himself
to
lerici
where
he
was
received
by
currado
and
went
up
with
all
his
company
to
one
of
the
latter
castles
not
far
removed
thence
where
there
was
a
great
banquet

the
mother

at
seeing
her
son
again
and
that

the
two
brothers
in
each
other
and
of
all
three
in
the
faithful
nurse
the
honour
done
of
all
to
messer
guasparrino
and
his
daughter
and
of
him
to
all
and
the
rejoicing
of
all
together
with
currado
and
his
lady
and
children
and
friends

things
reported
of

that

kept
in
captivity
by
king
charles
whenas
the
revolt
against
the
latter
broke
out
in
the
land
the
folk
ran
in
a
fury
to
the
prison
and
slaying
his
guards
delivered
himself
and
as
a
capital
enemy
of
king
charles
made
him
their
captain
and
followed
him
to
expel
and
slay
the
french
wherefore
he
was
become
in
especial
favour
with
king
pedro
who
had
reinstated
him
in
all
his
honours
and
possessions
and
was
now
in
great
good
case
the
messenger
added
that
he
had
received
himself
with
the
utmost
honour
and
had
rejoiced
with
inexpressible
joy
in
the
recovery
of
his
wife
and
son
of
whom
he
had
heard
nothing
since
his
capture
moreover
he
had
sent
a

for
them
with
divers
gentlemen
aboard
who
came
after
him

who
in
consequence
of
the
sicilian
vespers
succeeded
charles
as
king

sicily
the
messenger
was
received
and
hearkened
with
great
gladness
and
rejoicing
whilst
currado
with
certain
of
his
friends
set
out
incontinent
to
meet
the
gentlemen
who
came
for
madam
beritola
and
giusfredi
and
welcoming
them
joyously
introduced
them
into
his
banquet
which
was
not
yet
half
ended
there
both
the
lady
and
giusfredi
no
less
than
all
the
others
beheld
them
with
such
joyance
that
never

heard
the
like
and
the
gentlemen
ere
they
sat
down
to
meat
saluted
currado
and
his

on
the
part
of
arrighetto
thanking
them
as
best
they
knew
and
might
for
the
honour
done

himself

turning
to
messer
guasparrino

kindness
was
unlooked

avouched
themselves
most
certain
that
whenas
that
which
he
had
done
for
scacciato
should
be
known
of
arrighetto
the
like
thanks
and
yet
greater
would
be
rendered
him
footnote

in
modern
phrase
putting
himself
at
their
disposition
thereafter
they
banqueted
right
joyously
with
the
bridegrooms
at
the
of
the
two
wives
nor
that
day
alone
did
currado
entertain
his
and
other
his
kinsmen
and
friends
but
many
others
as
soon
as
the
rejoicings
were
somewhat
abated
it
appearing
to
madam
beritola
and
to
giusfredi
and
the
others
that
it
was
time
to
depart
they
took
leave
with
many
tears
of
currado
and
his
lady
and
messer
guasparrino
and
embarked
on
board
the
brigantine
carrying
spina
with
them
then
setting
sail
with
a
fair
wind
they
came
speedily
to
sicily
where
all
alike
both
sons
and
were
received
by
arrighetto
in
palermo
with
such
rejoicing
as
might
never
be
told

there
it
is
believed
that

all
lived
happily
a

thankfulness

not

sought

have
diligently
studied
to
acquire
them
grudging
no

no

in
the
quest

who
whereas
before
they
became
enriched
they
loved
their

without

perceived

can
with

be

by

sin

how
fair
was
a
saracen
lady
whom
it
befell
for
her
beauty
to
be
in
some
four
years
space
nine
times
wedded
anew
it
is
now
a
pretty
while
since
there
was
a
certain
soldan
of
babylon
by
name
berminedab
to
whom
in
his
day
many
things
happened
in
accordance
with
his
pleasure
amongst
many
other
children
both
male
and
female
he
had
a
daughter
called
alatiel
who
by
report
of
all
who
saw
her
was
the
fairest
woman
to
be
seen
in
the
world
in
those
days
and
having
in
a
great
defeat
he
had
inflicted
upon
a
vast
multitude
of
arabs
who
were
come
upon
him
been
seconded
by
the
king
of
algarve
had
at
his
request
given
her
to
him
to
wife
of
especial
favour
wherefore
embarking
her
aboard
a
ship
well
armed
and
equipped
with
an
honourable
company
of
men
and
ladies
and
store
of
rich
and
sumptuous
gear
and
furniture
he
despatched
her
to
him
commending
her
to
god

which
would
naturally
pass

on

from

the

seeing

gave

departing

fared
on
prosperously
many
days

having
now

deemed
themselves
near
the
end

voyage
when
there
arose
one
day
of
a
sudden
divers
contrary
winds
which
being
each
beyond
measure
boisterous
so
harassed
the
ship
wherein
was
the
lady
and
the
sailors
that
the
latter
more
than
once
gave
themselves
over
for
lost
however
like
valiant
men
using
every
art
and
means
in
their
power
they
rode
it
out
two
days
though
buffeted
by
a
terrible
sea
but
at
nightfall
of
the
third
day
the
tempest
abating
not
nay
waxing
momently
they
felt
the
ship
open
being
then
not
far
off
majorca
but
knowing
not
where
they
were
neither
availing
to
apprehend
it
either
by
nautical
reckoning
or
by
sight
for
that
the
sky
was
altogether
obscured
by
clouds
and
dark
night
wherefore
seeing
no
other
way
of
escape
and
having
each
himself
in
mind
and
not
others
they
lowered
a
shallop
into
the
water
into
which
the
officers
cast
themselves
choosing
rather
to
trust
themselves
thereto
than
to
the
leaking
ship
the
rest
of
the
men
in
the
ship
crowded
after
them
into
the
boat
albeit
those
who
had
first
embarked
therein
opposed
it
knife
in
hand
and
thinking
thus
to
flee
from
death
ran
straight
into
it
for
that
the
boat
availing
not
for
the
intemperance
of
the
weather
to
hold
so
many
foundered
and
they
perished
one
and
all
as
for
the
ship
being
driven
by
a
furious
wind
and
running
very
swiftly
albeit
it
was
now
well
nigh
none
being
left
on
board
save
the
princess
and
her
women
who
all
overcome
by
the
tempestuous
sea
and
by
fear
lay
about
the
decks
as
they
were
dead
it
stranded
upon
a
beach
of
the
island
of
majorca
and
such
and
so
great
was
the
shock
that
it
well
nigh
buried
itself
in
the
sand
some
stone
cast
from
the
shore
where
it
abode
the
night
beaten
by
the
waves
nor
might
the
wind
avail
to
stir
it
more
broad
day
came
and
the
tempest
somewhat
abating
the
princess
who
was
half
dead
raised
her
head
and
weak
as
she
was
fell
to
calling
now
one
now
another
of
her
household
but
to
no
purpose
for
that
those
she
called
were
too
far
distant
finding
herself
unanswered
of
any
and
seeing
no
one
she
marvelled
exceedingly
and
began
to
be
sore
afraid
then
rising
up
as
best
she
might
she
saw
the
ladies
who
were
in
her
company
and
the
other
women
lying
all
about
and
trying
now
one
and
now
another
found
few
who
gave
any
signs
of
life
the
most
of
them
being
dead
what
with
sore
travail
of
the
stomach
and
what
with
affright
wherefore
fear
redoubled
upon
her
nevertheless
necessity
constraining
her
for
that
she
saw
herself
alone
there
and
had
neither
knowledge
nor
inkling
where
she
was
she
so
goaded
those
who
were
yet
alive
that
she
made
them
arise
and
finding
them
unknowing
whither
the
men
were
gone
and
seeing
the
ship
stranded
and
full
of
water
she
fell
to
weeping
piteously
together
with
them
it
was
noon
ere
they
saw
any
about
the
shore
or
elsewhere
whom
they
might
move
to
pity
and
succour
them
but
about
that
hour
there
passed
by
a
gentleman
by
name
pericone
da
visalgo
returning
by
chance
from
a
place
of
his
with
sundry
of
his
servants
on
horseback
he
saw
the
ship
and
forthright
conceiving
what
it
was
bade
one
of
the
servants
board
it
without
delay
and
tell
him
what
he
found
there
the
man
though
with
difficulty
made
his
way
on
board
and
found
the
young
lady
with
what
little
company
she
had
crouched
all
adread
under
the
heel
of
the
bowsprit
when
they
saw
him
they
besought
him
weeping
of
mercy
again
and
again
but
perceiving
that
he
understood
them
not
nor
they
him
they
made
shift
to
make
known
to
him
their
misadventure
by
signs
the
servant
having
examined
everything
as
best
he
might
reported
to
pericone
that
which
was
on
board
whereupon
the
latter
promptly
caused
to
bring
the
ladies
ashore
together
with
the
most
precious
things
that
were
in
the
ship
and
might
be
gotten
and
carried
them
off
to
a
castle
of
his
where
the
women
being
refreshed
with
food
and
rest
he
perceived
from
the
richness
of
her
apparel
that
the
lady
whom
he
had
found
must
needs
be
some
great
gentlewoman
and
of
this
he
was
speedily
certified
by
the
honour
that
he
saw
the
others
do
her
and
her
alone
and
although
she
was
pale
and
sore
disordered
of
her
person
for
the
fatigues
of
the
voyage
her
features
seemed
to
him
exceeding
fair
wherefore
he
forthright
took
counsel
with
himself
an
she
had
no
husband
to
seek
to
have
her
to
wife
and
if
he
might
not
have
her
in
marriage
to
make
shift
to
have
her
favours
he
was
a
man
of
commanding
presence
and
exceeding
robust
and
having
for
some
days
let
tend
the
lady
excellently
well
and
she
being
thereby
altogether
restored
he
saw
her
lovely
past
all
conception
and
was
grieved
beyond
measure
that
he
could
not
understand
her
nor
she
him
and
so
he
might
not
learn
who
she
was
nevertheless
being
inordinately
inflamed
by
her
charms
he
studied
with
pleasing
and
amorous
gestures
to
engage
her
to
do
his
pleasure
without
contention
but
to
no
avail
she
altogether
rejected
his
advances
and
so
much
the
more
waxed
pericone
ardour
the
lady
seeing
this
and
having
now
abidden
there
some
days
perceived
by
the
usances
of
the
folk
that
she
was
among
christians
and
in
a
country
where
even
if
she
could
it
had
little
profited
her
to
make
herself
known
and
foresaw
that
in
the
end
either
perforce
or
for
love
needs
must
she
resign
herself
to
do
pericone
pleasure
but
resolved
nevertheless
by
dint
of
magnanimity
to
override
the
wretchedness
of
her
fortune
wherefore
she
commanded
her
women
of
whom
but
three
were
left
her
that
they
should
never
discover
to
any
who
she
was
except
they
found
themselves
whereas
they
might
look
for
manifest
furtherance
in
the
regaining
of
their
liberty
and
urgently
exhorted
them
moreover
to
preserve
their
chastity
avouching
herself
determined
that
none
save
her
husband
should
ever
enjoy
her
they
commended
her
for
this
and
promised
to
observe
her
commandment
to
the
best
of
their
power
meanwhile
pericone
waxing
daily
more
inflamed
insomuch
as
he
saw
the
thing
desired
so
near
and
yet
so
straitly
denied
and
seeing
that
his
blandishments
availed
him
nothing
resolved
to
employ
craft
and
artifice
reserving
force
unto
the
last
wherefore
having
observed
bytimes
that
wine
was
pleasing
to
the
lady
as
being
unused
to
drink
thereof
for
that
her
law
forbade
it
he
bethought
himself
that
he
might
avail
to
take
her
with
this
as
with
a
minister
of
enus
accordingly
feigning
to
reck
no
more
of
that
whereof
she
showed
herself
so
chary
he
made
one
night
by
way
of
special
festival
a
goodly
supper
whereto
he
bade
the
lady
and
therein
the
repast
being
gladdened
with
many
things
he
took
order
with
him
who
served
her
that
he
should
give
her
to
drink
of
various
wines
mingled
the
cupbearer
did
his
bidding
punctually
and
she
being
nowise
on
her
guard
against
this
and
allured
by
the
pleasantness
of
the
drink
took
more
thereof
than
consisted
with
her
modesty
whereupon
forgetting
all
her
past
troubles
she
waxed
merry
and
seeing
some
women
dance
after
the
fashion
of
majorca
herself
danced
in
the
alexandrian
manner
pericone
seeing
this
deemed
himself
on
the
high
road
to
that
which
he
desired
and
continuing
the
supper
with
great
plenty
of
meats
and
wines
protracted
it
far
into
the
night
ultimately
the
guests
having
departed
he
entered
with
the
lady
alone
into
her
chamber
where
she
more
heated
with
wine
than
restrained
by
modesty
without
any
reserve
of
shamefastness
undid
herself
in
his
presence
as
he
had
been
one
of
her
women
and
betook
herself
to
bed
pericone
was
not
slow
to
follow
her
but
putting
out
all
the
lights
promptly
hid
himself
beside
her
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
proceeded
without
any
gainsayal
on
her
part
amorously
to
solace
himself
with
her
which
when
once
she
had
felt

never
theretofore
known
with
what
manner

butt

repenting
her
of
not
having
yielded
to
solicitations
thenceforth
without
waiting
to
be
bidden
to
such
agreeable
nights
she
oftentimes
invited
herself
thereto
not
by
words
which
she
knew
not
how
to
make
understood

took
the

awake

in

threatening
her
with

if
she
made

should
revert
upon
herself

the
prayers
of

wounded
man

their
speedy
arrival
at

delivered
her
from
danger
of
death
there
she
went
ashore
with
the
wounded
man
and
took
up
her
abode
with
him
in
an
inn
where
the
report
of

great
beauty
soon
spread
through

chiarenza
and
was
fain
to
see
her
having
gotten
sight
of
her
and
himseeming
she
was
fairer
than
report
gave
out
he
straightway
became
so
sore
enamoured
of
her
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
hearing
how
she
came
thither
doubted
not
to
be
able
to
get
her
for
himself
as
he
cast
about
for
a
means
of
effecting
his
purpose
the
wounded
man
kinsfolk
got
wind
of
his
desire
and
without
awaiting
more
sent
her
to
him
forthright
which
was
mighty
agreeable
to
the
prince
and
to
the
lady
also
for
that
herseemed
she
was
quit
of
a
great
peril
the
prince
seeing
her
graced
over
and
above
her
beauty
with
royal
manners
and
unable
otherwise
to
learn
who
she
was
concluded
her
to
be
some
noble
lady
wherefore
he
redoubled
in
his
love
for
her
and
holding
her
in
exceeding
honour
entreated
her
not
as
a
mistress
but
as
his
very
wife
the
lady
accordingly
having
regard
to
her
past
troubles
and
herseeming
she
was
well
enough
bestowed
was
altogether
comforted
and
waxing
blithe
again
her
beauties
flourished
on
such
wise
that
it
seemed
all
roumelia
could
talk
of
nothing
else
the
report
of
her
loveliness
reaching
the
duke
of
athens
who
was
young
and
handsome
and
doughty
of
his
person
and
a
friend
and
kinsman
of
the
prince
he
was
taken
with
a
desire
to
see
her
and
making
a
show
of
paying
him
a
visit
as
he
was
wont
bytimes
to
do
repaired
with
a
fair
and
worshipful
company
to
chiarenza
where
he
was
honourably
received
and
sumptuously
entertained
some
days
after
the
two
kinsmen
coming
to
discourse
together
of
the
lady
charms
the
duke
asked
if
she
were
indeed
so
admirable
a
creature
as
was
reported
to
which
the
prince
answered
more
so
but
thereof
i
will
have
not
my
words
but
thine
own
eyes
certify
thee
accordingly
at
the
solicitation
they
betook
themselves
together
to
the
lodging
who
having
had
notice
of
their
coming
received
them
very
courteously
and
with
a
cheerful
favour
and
they
seated
her
between
them
but
might
not
have
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
her
for
that
she
understood
little
or
nothing
of
their
language
wherefore
each
contented
himself
with
gazing
upon
her
as
upon
a
marvel
and
especially
the
duke
who
could
scarce
bring
himself
to
believe
that
she
was
a
mortal
creature
and
thinking
to
satisfy
his
desire
with
her
sight
heedless
of
the
amorous
poison
he
drank
in
at
his
eyes
beholding
her
he
miserably
ensnared
himself
becoming
most
ardently
enamoured
of
her
after
he
had
departed
her
presence
with
the
prince
and
had
leisure
to
bethink
himself
he
esteemed
his
kinsman
happy
beyond
all
others
in
having
so
fair
a
creature
at
his
pleasure
and
after
many
and
various
thoughts
his
unruly
passion
weighing
more
with
him
than
his
honour
he
resolved
come
thereof
what
might
to
do
his
utmost
endeavour
to
despoil
the
prince
of
that
felicity
and
bless
himself
therewith
accordingly
being
minded
to
make
a
quick
despatch
of
the
matter
and
setting
aside
all
reason
and
all
equity
he
turned
his
every
thought
to
the
devising
of
means
for
the
attainment
of
his
wishes
and
one
day
in
accordance
with
the
nefarious
ordinance
taken
by
him
with
a
privy
chamberlain
of
the
prince
by
name
ciuriaci
he
let
make
ready
in
secret
his
horses
and
baggage
for
a
sudden
departure
the
night
come
he
was
with
a
companion
both
armed
stealthily
introduced
by
the
aforesaid
ciuriaci
into
the
prince
chamber
and
saw
the
latter
the
lady
being
asleep
standing
all
naked
for
the
great
heat
at
a
window
overlooking
the
to
take
a
little
breeze
that
came
from
that
quarter
whereupon
having
beforehand
informed
his
companion
of
that
which
he
had
to
do
he
went
softly
up
to
the
window
and
striking
the
prince
with
a
knife
stabbed
him
through
and
through
the
small
of
his
back
then
taking
him
up
in
haste
he
cast
him
forth
of
the
window
the
palace
stood
over
against
the
sea
and
was
very
lofty
and
the
window
in
question
looked
upon
certain
houses
that
had
been
undermined
by
the
beating
of
the
waves
and
where
seldom
or
never
any
came
wherefore
it
happened
as
the
duke
had
foreseen
that
the
fall
of
the
prince
body
was
not
nor
might
be
heard
of
any
the
duke
companion
seeing
this
done
pulled
out
a
halter
he
had
brought
with
him
to
that
end
and
making
a
show
of
caressing
ciuriaci
cast
it
adroitly
about
his
neck
and
drew
it
so
that
he
could
make
no
outcry
then
the
duke
coming
up
they
strangled
him
and
cast
him
whereas
they
had
cast
the
prince
this
done
and
they
being
manifestly
certified
that
they
had
been
unheard
of
the
lady
or
of
any
other
the
duke
took
a
light
in
his
hand
and
carrying
it
to
the
bedside
softly
uncovered
the
princess
who
slept
fast
he
considered
her
from
head
to
foot
and
mightily
commended
her
for
if
she
was
to
his
liking
being
clothed
she
pleased
him
naked
beyond
all
compare
wherefore
fired
with
hotter
desire
and
unawed
by
his
crime
he
couched
himself
by
her
side
with
hands
yet
bloody
and
lay
with
her
all
as
she
was
and
thinking
him
to
be
the
prince
after
he
had
abidden
with
her
awhile
in
the
utmost
pleasure
he
arose
and
summoning
certain
of
his
companions
caused
take
up
the
lady
on
such
wise
that
she
could
make
no
outcry
and
carry
her
forth
by
a
privy
door
whereat
he
had
entered
then
setting
her
on
horseback
he
took
to
the
road
with
all
his
men
as
softliest
he
might
and
returned
to
his
own
dominions
however
for
that
he
had
a
wife
he
carried
the
lady
who
was
the
most
distressful
of
women
not
to
athens
but
to
a
very
goodly
place
he
had
by
the
sea
a
little
without
the
city
and
there
entertained
her
in
secret
causing
honourably
furnish
her
with
all
that
was
needful
the
prince
courtiers
on
the
morrow
awaited
his
rising
till
none
when
hearing
nothing
they
opened
the
which
were
but
closed
and
finding
no
one
concluded
that
he
was
gone
somewhither
privily
to
pass
some
days
there
at
his
ease
with
his
fair
lady
and
gave
themselves
no
farther
concern
things
being
thus
it
chanced
next
day
that
an
idiot
entering
the
ruins
where
lay
the
bodies
of
the
prince
and
ciuriaci
dragged
the
latter
forth
by
the
halter
and
went
haling
him
after
him
the
body
was
with
no
little
wonderment
recognized
by
many
who
coaxing
the
idiot
to
bring
them
to
the
place
whence
he
had
dragged
it
there
to
the
exceeding
grief
of
the
whole
city
found
the
prince
corpse
and
gave
it
honourable
burial
then
enquiring
for
the
authors
of
so
heinous
a
crime
and
finding
that
the
duke
of
athens
was
no
longer
there
but
had
departed
by
stealth
they
concluded
even
as
was
the
case
that
it
must
be
he
who
had
done
this
and
carried
off
the
lady
whereupon
they
straightway
substituted
a
brother
of
the
dead
man
to
their
prince
and
incited
him
with
all
their
might
to
vengeance
the
new
prince
being
presently
certified
by
various
other
circumstances
that
it
was
as
they
had
surmised
summoned
his
friends
and
kinsmen
and
servants
from
divers
parts
and
promptly
levying
a
great
and
goodly
and
powerful
army
set
out
to
make
war
upon
the
duke
of
athens
the
latter
hearing
of
this
on
like
wise
mustered
all
his
forces
for
his
own
defence
and
to
his
aid
came
many
lords
amongst
whom
the
emperor
of
constantinople
sent
constantine
his
son
and
manual
his
nephew
with
a
great
and
goodly
following
the
two
princes
were
honourably
received
by
the
duke
and
yet
more
so
by
the
duchess
for
that
she
was
their
sister
and
matters
drawing
thus
daily
nearer
unto
war
taking
her
occasion
she
sent
for
them
both
one
day
to
her
chamber
and
there
with
tears
galore
and
many
words
related
to
them
the
whole
story
acquainting
them
with
the
causes
of
the
war
moreover
she
discovered
to
them
the
affront
done
her
by
the
duke
in
the
matter
of
the
woman
whom
it
was
believed
he
privily
entertained
and
complaining
sore
thereof
besought
them
to
apply
to
the
matter
such
remedy
as
best
they
might
for
the
honour
of
the
duke
and
her
own
solacement
footnote
sister
to
the
one
and
cousin
to
the
other
the
young
men
already
knew
all
the
facts
as
it
had
been
wherefore
without
enquiring
farther
they
comforted
the
duchess
as
best
they
might
and
filled
her
with
good
hope
then
having
learned
from
her
where
the
lady
abode
they
took
their
leave
and
having
a
mind
to
see
the
latter
for
that
they
had
oftentimes
heard
her
commended
for
marvellous
beauty
they
besought
the
duke
to
show
her
to
them
he
unmindful
of
that
which
had
befallen
the
prince
of
the
morea
for
having
shown
her
to
himself
promised
to
do
this
and
accordingly
next
morning
having
let
prepare
a
magnificent
collation
in
a
very
goodly
garden
that
pertained
to
the
lady
place
of
abode
he
carried
them
and
a
few
others
thither
to
eat
with
her
constantine
sitting
with
alatiel
fell
upon
her
full
of
wonderment
avouching
in
himself
that
he
had
never
seen
aught
so
lovely
and
that
certes
the
duke
must
needs
be
held
excused
ay
and
whatsoever
other
to
have
so
fair
a
creature
should
do
treason
or
other
foul
thing
and
looking
on
her
again
and
again
and
each
time
admiring
her
more
it
betided
him
no
otherwise
than
it
had
betided
the
duke
wherefore
taking
his
leave
enamoured
of
her
he
abandoned
all
thought
of
the
war
and
occupied
himself
with
considering
how
he
might
take
her
from
the
duke
carefully
concealing
his
passion
the
while
from
every
one
whilst
he
yet
burnt
in
this
fire
the
time
came
to
go
out
against
the
new
prince
who
now
drew
near
to
the
duke
territories
wherefore
the
latter
and
constantine
and
all
the
others
sallied
forth
of
athens
according
to
the
given
ordinance
and
betook
themselves
to
the
defence
of
certain
frontiers
so
the
prince
might
not
avail
to
advance
farther
when
they
had
lain
there
some
days
constantine
having
his
mind
and
thought
still
intent
upon
the
lady
and
conceiving
that
now
the
duke
was
no
longer
near
her
he
might
very
well
avail
to
accomplish
his
pleasure
feigned
himself
sore
indisposed
of
his
person
to
have
an
occasion
of
returning
to
athens
wherefore
with
the
duke
leave
committing
his
whole
power
to
manuel
he
returned
to
athens
to
his
sister
and
there
after
some
days
putting
her
upon
talk
of
the
affront
which
herseemed
she
suffered
from
the
duke
by
reason
of
the
lady
whom
he
entertained
he
told
her
that
an
it
liked
her
he
would
soon
ease
her
thereof
by
causing
take
the
lady
from
whereas
she
was
and
carry
her
off
the
duchess
conceiving
that
he
did
this
of
regard
for
herself
and
not
for
love
of
the
lady
answered
that
it
liked
her
exceeding
well
so
but
it
might
be
done
on
such
wise
that
the
duke
should
never
know
that
she
had
been
party
thereto
which
constantine
fully
promised
her
and
thereupon
she
consented
that
he
should
do
as
seemed
best
to
him
constantine
accordingly
let
secretly
equip
a
light
vessel
and
sent
it
one
evening
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
garden
where
the
lady
abode
then
having
taught
certain
of
his
men
who
were
on
board
what
they
had
to
do
he
repaired
with
others
to
the
lady
pavilion
where
he
was
cheerfully
received
by
those
in
her
service
and
indeed
by
the
lady
herself
who
at
his
instance
betook
herself
with
him
to
the
garden
attended
by
her
servitors
and
his
companions
there
making
as
he
would
speak
with
her
on
the
duke
part
he
went
with
her
alone
towards
a
gate
which
gave
upon
the
sea
and
had
already
been
opened
by
one
of
his
men
and
calling
the
bark
thither
with
the
given
signal
he
caused
suddenly
seize
the
lady
and
carry
her
aboard
then
turning
to
her
people
he
said
to
them
none
stir
or
utter
a
word
an
he
would
not
die
for
that
i
purpose
not
to
rob
the
duke
of
his
wench
but
to
do
away
the
affront
which
he
putteth
upon
my
sister
to
this
none
dared
make
answer
whereupon
constantine
embarking
with
his
people
and
seating
himself
by
the
side
of
the
weeping
lady
bade
thrust
the
oars
into
the
water
and
make
off
accordingly
they
put
out
to
sea
and
not
hieing

flying
came
after
a

after
daybreak
on
the
morrow
to
egina

they
landed
and
took
rest
whilst
constantine
solaced
himself
awhile
with
the
lady
who
bemoaned
her
beauty
thence
going
aboard
the
bark
again
they
made
their
way
in
a
few
days
to
chios
where
it
pleased
constantine
to
take
up
his
sojourn
as
in
a
place
of
safety
for
fear
of
his
resentment
and
lest
the
stolen
lady
should
be
taken
from
him
there
the
fair
lady
bewailed
her
ill
fate
some
days
but
being
presently
comforted
by
constantine
she
began
as

was
mighty
agreeable
to
her
as
well
as
it
might
be
to
one
whom
it
had
behoved
for
some
years
live
as
she
were
deaf
and
dumb
for
that
she
understood
none
neither
was
understanded
of
any
he
began
in
a
few
days
to
be
so
familiar
with
her
that
ere
long
having
no
regard
to
their
lord
and
master
who
was
absent
in
the
field
they
passed
from
friendly
commerce
to
amorous
privacy
taking
marvellous
pleasure
one
of
the
other
between
the
sheets
when
they
heard
that
osbech
was
defeated
and
slain
and
that
bassano
came
carrying
all
before
him
they
took
counsel
together
not
to
await
him
there
and
laying
hands
on
great
part
of
the
things
of
most
price
that
were
there
pertaining
to
osbech
gat
them
privily
to
rhodes
where
they
had
not
long
abidden
ere
antiochus
sickened
unto
death
as
chance
would
have
it
there
was
then
in
lodging
with
him
a
merchant
of
cyprus
who
was
much
loved
of
him
and
his
fast
friend
and
antiochus
feeling
himself
draw
to
his
end
bethought
himself
to
leave
him
both
his
possessions
and
his
beloved
lady
wherefore
being
now
nigh
upon
death
he
called
them
both
to
him
and
bespoke
them
thus
feel
myself
without
a
doubt
passing
away
which
grieveth
me
for
that
never
had
i
such
delight
in
life
as
i
presently
have
of
one
thing
indeed
i
die
most
content
in
that
since
i
must
die
i
see
myself
die
in
the
arms
of
those
twain
whom
i
love
over
all
others
that
be
in
the
world
to
wit
in
thine
dearest
friend
and
in
those
of
this
lady
whom
i
have
loved
more
than
mine
own
self
since
first
i
knew
her
true
it
grieveth
me
to
feel
that
when
i
am
dead
she
will
abide
here
a
stranger
without
aid
or
counsel
and
it
were
yet
more
grievous
to
me
did
i
not
know
thee
here
who
wilt
i
trust
have
that
same
care
of
her
for
the
love
of
me
which
thou
wouldst
have
had
of
myself
wherefore
i
entreat
thee
as
most
i
may
if
it
come
to
pass
that
i
die
that
thou
take
my
goods
and
her
into
thy
charge
and
do
with
them
and
her
that
which
thou
deemest
may
be
for
the
solacement
of
my
soul
and
thou
dearest
lady
i
prithee
forget
me
not
after
my
death
so
i
may
vaunt
me
in
the
other
world
of
being
beloved
here
below
of
the
fairest
lady
ever
nature
formed
of
which
two
things
an
you
will
give
me
entire
assurance
i
shall
depart
without
misgiving
and
comforted
the
merchant
his
friend
and
the
lady
hearing
these
words
wept
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
his
speech
they
comforted
him
and
promised
him
upon
their
troth
to
do
that
which
he
asked
if
it
came
to
pass
that
he
died
he
tarried
not
long
but
presently
departed
this
life
and
was
honourably
interred
of
them
a
few
days
after
the
merchant
having
despatched
all
his
business
in
rhodes
and
purposing
to
return
to
cyprus
on
board
a
catalan
carrack
that
was
there
asked
the
fair
lady
what
she
had
a
mind
to
do
for
that
it
behoved
him
return
to
cyprus
she
answered
that
an
it
pleased
him
she
would
gladly
go
with
him
hoping
for
antiochus
his
love
to
be
of
him
entreated
and
regarded
as
a
sister
the
merchant
replied
that
he
was
content
to
do
her
every
pleasure
and
the
better
to
defend
her
from
any
affront
that
might
be
offered
her
ere
they
came
to
cyprus
he
avouched
that
she
was
his
wife
accordingly
they
embarked
on
board
the
ship
and
were
given
a
little
cabin
on
the
poop
where
that
the
fact
might
not
belie
his
words
he
lay
with
her
in
one
very
small
bed
whereby
there
came
about
that
which
was
not
intended
of
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
at
departing
rhodes
to
wit
that
darkness
and
commodity
and
the
heat
of
the
bed
matters
of
no
small
potency
inciting
them
drawn
by
equal
appetite
and
forgetting
both
the
friendship
and
the
love
of
antiochus
dead
they
fell
to
dallying
with
each
other
and
before
they
reached
baffa
whence
the
cypriot
came
they
had
clapped
up
an
alliance
together
at
baffa
she
abode
some
time
with
the
merchant
till
as
chance
would
have
it
there
came
thither
for
his
occasions
a
gentleman
by
name
antigonus
great
of
years
and
greater
yet
of
wit
but
little
of
wealth
for
that
intermeddling
in
the
affairs
of
the
king
of
cyprus
fortune
had
in
many
things
been
contrary
to
him
chancing
one
day
to
pass
by
the
house
where
the
fair
lady
dwelt
with
the
merchant
who
was
then
gone
with
his
merchandise
into
armenia
he
espied
her
at
a
window
and
seeing
her
very
beautiful
fell
to
gazing
fixedly
upon
her
and
presently
began
to
recollect
that
he
must
have
seen
her
otherwhere
but
where
he
could
on
no
wise
call
to
mind
as
for
the
lady
who
had
long
been
the
sport
of
fortune
but
the
term
of
whose
ills
was
now
drawing
near
she
no
sooner
set
eyes
on
antigonus
than
she
remembered
to
have
seen
him
at
alexandria
in
no
mean
station
in
her
service
wherefore
conceiving
a
sudden
hope
of
yet
by
his
aid
regaining
her
royal
estate
and
knowing
her
merchant
to
be
abroad
she
let
call
him
to
her
as
quickliest
she
might
and
asked
him
blushing
an
he
were
not
as
she
supposed
antigonus
of
famagosta
he
answered
that
he
was
and
added
meseemeth
i
know
you
but
on
no
wise
can
i
remember
me
where
i
have
seen
you
wherefore
i
pray
you
an
it
mislike
you
not
put
me
in
mind
who
you
are
the
lady
hearing
that
it
was
indeed
he
to
his
great
amazement
cast
her
arms
about
his
neck
weeping
sore
and
presently
asked
him
if
he
had
never
seen
her
in
alexandria
antigonus
hearing
this
incontinent
knew
her
for
the
soldan
daughter
alatiel
who
was
thought
to
have
perished
at
sea
and
would
fain
have
paid
her
the
homage
due
to
her
quality
but
she
would
on
no
wise
suffer
it
and
besought
him
to
sit
with
her
awhile
accordingly
seating
himself
beside
her
he
asked
her
respectfully
how
and
when
and
whence
she
came
thither
seeing
that
it
was
had
for
certain
through
all
the
land
of
egypt
that
she
had
been
drowned
at
sea
years
agone
god
replied
she
had
been
so
rather
than
that
i
should
have
had
the
life
i
have
had
and
i
doubt
not
but
my
father
would
wish
the
like
if
ever
he
came
to
know
it
so
saying
she
fell
anew
to
weeping
whereupon
quoth
antigonus
to
her
despair
not
ere
it
behove
you
but
an
it
please
you
relate
to
me
your
adventures
and
what
manner
of
life
yours
hath
been
it
may
be
the
matter
hath
gone
on
such
wise
that
with
god
aid
we
may
avail
to
find
an
effectual
remedy
answered
the
fair
lady
i
beheld
thee
meseemed
i
saw
my
father
and
moved
by
that
love
and
tenderness
which
i
am
bounden
to
bear
him
i
discovered
myself
to
thee
having
it
in
my
power
to
conceal
myself
from
thee
and
few
persons
could
it
have
befallen
me
to
look
upon
in
whom
i
could
have
been
so
as
i
am
to
have
seen
and
known
thee
before
any
other
wherefore
that
which
in
my
ill
fortune
i
have
still
kept
hidden
to
thee
as
to
a
father
i
will
discover
if
after
thou
hast
heard
it
thou
see
any
means
of
restoring
me
to
my
pristine
estate
prithee
use
it
but
if
thou
see
none
i
beseech
thee
never
tell
any
that
thou
hast
seen
me
or
heard
aught
of
me
this
said
she
recounted
to
him
still
weeping
that
which
had
befallen
her
from
the
time
of
her
shipwreck
on
majorca
up
to
that
moment
whereupon
he
fell
for
pity
and
after
considering
awhile
said
he
in
your
misfortunes
it
hath
been
hidden
who
you
are
i
will
without
fail
restore
you
dearer
than
ever
to
your
father
and
after
to
the
king
of
algarve
to
wife
being
questioned
of
her
of
the
means
he
showed
her
orderly
that
which
was
to
do
and
lest
any
hindrance
should
betide
through
delay
he
presently
returned
to
famagosta
and
going
in
to
the
king
said
to
him
lord
an
it
like
you
you
have
it
in
your
power
at
once
to
do
yourself
exceeding
honour
and
me
who
am
poor
through
you
a
great
service
at
no
great
cost
of
yours
the
king
asked
how
and
antigonus
replied
is
come
to
baffa
the
soldan
fair
young
daughter
who
hath
so
long
been
reputed
drowned
and
who
to
save
her
honour
hath
long
suffered
very
great
unease
and
is
presently
in
poor
case
and
would
fain
return
to
her
father
an
it
pleased
you
send
her
to
him
under
my
guard
it
would
be
much
to
your
honour
and
to
my
weal
nor
do
i
believe
that
such
a
service
would
ever
be
forgotten
of
the
soldan
the
king
moved
by
a
royal
generosity
of
mind
answered
forthright
that
he
would
well
and
sending
for
alatiel
brought
her
with
all
honour
and
worship
to
famagosta
where
she
was
received
by
himself
and
the
queen
with
inexpressible
rejoicing
and
entertained
with
magnificent
hospitality
being
presently
questioned
of
the
king
and
queen
of
her
adventures
she
answered
according
to
the
instructions
given
her
by
antigonus
and
related
everything
and
a
few
days
after
at
her
request
the
king
sent
her
under
the
governance
of
antigonus
with
a
goodly
and
worshipful
company
of
men
and
women
back
to
the
soldan
of
whom
let
none
ask
if
she
was
received
with
rejoicing
as
also
was
antigonus
and
all
her
company
footnote
sic
but
this
is
an
oversight
of
the
author
as
it
is
evident
from
what
follows
that
she
did
relate
everything
as
soon
as
she
was
somewhat
rested
the
soldan
desired
to
know
how
it
chanced
that
she
was
yet
alive
and
where
she
had
so
long
abidden
without
having
ever
let
him
know
aught
of
her
condition
whereupon
the
lady
who
had
kept
antigonus
his
instructions
perfectly
in
mind
bespoke
him
thus

belike

twentieth
day
after
my
departure

you

night

coasts

place

what
became
of
the
men

were
aboard
i
know
not

do
i
remember
that
the
day

i
arisen
as
it
were
from
death
to
life
the
shattered
vessel
was
espied
of
the
country
people
who
ran
from
all
the
parts
around
to
plunder
it
i
and
two
of
my
women
were
first
set
ashore
and
the
latter
were
incontinent
seized
by
certain
of
the
young
men
who
fled
with
them
one
this
way
and
the
other
that
and
what
came
of
them
i
never
knew

ponant
the
western
coasts
of
the
mediterranean
as
opposed
to
the

as
for
myself
i
was
taken
despite
my
resistance
by
two
young
men
and
haled
along
by
the
hair
weeping
sore
the
while
but
as
they
crossed
over
a
road
to
enter
a
great
wood
there
passed
by
four
men
on
horseback
whom
when
my
ravishers
saw
they
loosed
me
forthwith
and
took
to
flight
the
new
comers
who
seemed
to
me
persons
of
great
authority
seeing
this
ran
where
i
was
and
asked
me
many
questions
whereto
i
answered
much
but
neither
understood
nor
was
understanded
of
them
however
after
long
consultation
they
set
me
on
one
of
their
horses
and
carried
me
to
a
convent
of
women
vowed
to
religion
according
to
their
law
where
whatever
they
said
i
was
of
all
the
ladies
kindly
received
and
still
entreated
with
honour
and
there
with
great
devotion
i
joined
them
in
serving
saint

saint
for
whom
the
women
of
that
country
have
a
vast
regard
after
i
had
abidden
with
them
awhile
and
learned
somewhat
of
their
language
they
questioned
me
of
who
i
was
and
fearing
an
i
told
the
truth
to
be
expelled
from
amongst
them
as
an
enemy
of
their
faith
i
answered
that
i
was
the
daughter
of
a
great
gentleman
of
cyprus
who
was
sending
me
to
be
married
in
crete
when
as
would
have
it
we
had
run
thither
and
suffered
shipwreck
moreover
many
a
time
and
in
many
things
i
observed
their
customs
for
fear
of
worse
and
being
asked
by
the
chief
of
the
ladies
her
whom
they
call
abbess
if
i
wished
to
return
thence
to
cyprus
i
answered
that
i
desired
nothing
so
much
but
she
tender
of
my
honour
would
never
consent
to
trust
me
to
any
person
who
was
bound
for
cyprus
till
some
two
months
agone
when
there
came
thither
certain
gentlemen
of
france
with
their
ladies
one
of
the
latter
being
a
kinswoman
of
the
abbess
and
she
hearing
that
they
were
bound
for
jerusalem
to
visit
the
sepulchre
where
he
whom
they
hold
god
was
buried
after
he
had
been
slain
by
the
jews
she
commended
me
to
their
care
and
besought
them
to
deliver
me
to
my
father
in
cyprus
with
what
honour
these
gentlemen
entreated
me
and
how
cheerfully
they
received
me
together
with
their
ladies
it
were
a
long
story
to
tell
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
took
ship
and
came
after
some
days
to
baffa
where
finding
myself
arrived
and
knowing
none
in
the
place
i
knew
not
what
to
say
to
the
gentlemen
who
would
fain
have
delivered
me
to
my
father
according
to
that
which
had
been
enjoined
them
of
the
reverend
lady
but
god
taking
pity
belike
on
my
affliction
brought
me
antigonus
upon
the
beach
what
time
we
disembarked
at
baffa
whom
i
straightway
hailed
and
in
our
tongue
so
as
not
to
be
understood
of
the
gentlemen
and
their
ladies
bade
him
receive
me
as
a
daughter
he
promptly
apprehended
me
and
receiving
me
with
a
great
show
of
joy
entertained
the
gentlemen
and
their
ladies
with
such
honour
as
his
poverty
permitted
and
carried
me
to
the
king
of
cyprus
who
received
me
with
such
hospitality
and
hath
sent
me
back
to
you
with
such
courtesy
as
might
never
be
told
of
me
if
aught
remain
to
be
said
let
antigonus
who
hath
ofttimes
heard
from
me
these
adventures
recount
it
accordingly
antigonus
turning
to
the
soldan
said
lord
even
as
she
hath
many
a
time
told
me
and
as
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
with
whom
she
came
said
to
me
so
hath
she
recounted
unto
you
only
one
part
hath
she
forborne
to
tell
you
the
which
methinketh
she
left
unsaid
for
that
it
beseemeth
her
not
to
tell
it
to
wit
how
much
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
with
whom
she
came
said
of
the
chaste
and
modest
life
which
she
led
with
the
religious
ladies
and
of
her
virtue
and
commendable
manners
and
the
tears
and
lamentations
of
her
companions
both
men
and
women
when
having
restored
her
to
me
they
took
leave
of
her
of
which
things
were
i
fain
to
tell
in
full
that
which
they
said
to
me
not
only
this
present
day
but
the
ensuing
night
would
not
suffice
unto
us
be
it
enough
to
say
only
that
according
to
that
which
their
words
attested
and
that
also
which
i
have
been
able
to
see
thereof
you
may
vaunt
yourself
of
having
the
fairest
daughter
and
the
chastest
and
most
virtuous
of
any
prince
that
nowadays
weareth
a
crown
the
soldan
was
beyond
measure
rejoiced
at
these
things
and
besought
god
again
and
again
to
vouchsafe
him
of
his
grace

the

thanks
to
the

that
which
he
had
done

which
was

should
have

acquainted

rejoiced
at

it
in

strange

grievous
chances
wherefore
to
come
to
tell
of
one
of
these
latter
which
are
innumerable
i
say
that
when
the
roman
empire
was
transferred
from
the
french
to
the
germans
there
arose
between
the
one
and
the
other
nation
an
exceeding
great
enmity
and
a
grievous
and
continual
war
by
reason
whereof
as
well
for
the
defence
of
their
own
country
as
for
the
offence
of
that
of
others
the
king
of
france
and
a
son
of
his
with
all
the
power
of
their
realm
and
of
such
friends
and
kinsfolk
as
they
could
command
levied
a
mighty
army
to
go
forth
upon
the
foe
and
ere
they
proceeded
thereunto
not
to
leave
the
realm
without
governance
knowing
gautier
count
of
antwerp
for
a
noble
and
discreet
gentleman
and
their
very
faithful
friend
and
servant
and
for
that
albeit
he
was
well
versed
in
the
art
of
war
he
seemed
to
them
more
apt
unto
things
delicate
than
unto
martial
toils
they
left
him
vicar
general
in
their
stead
over
all
the
governance
of
the
realm
of
france
and
went
on
their
way
gautier
accordingly
addressed
himself
with
both
order
and
discretion
to
the
office
committed
unto
him
still
conferring
of
everything
with
the
queen
and
her
whom
for
all
they
were
left
under
his
custody
and
jurisdiction
he
honoured
none
the
less
as
his
liege
ladies
and
mistresses

cast
her

on

and
considering
his

his

with
very
great
affection
was
secretly
fired
with
a
fervent
love
for
him
feeling
herself
young
and
lusty
and
knowing
him
wifeless
she
doubted
not
but
her
desire
might
lightly
be
accomplished
unto
her
and
thinking
nought
hindered
her
thereof
but
shamefastness
she
bethought
herself
altogether
to
put
that
away
and
discover
to
him
her
passion
accordingly
being
one
day
alone
and
it
seeming
to
her
time
she
sent
for
him
into
her
chamber
as
though
she
would
discourse
with
him
of
other
matters
the
count
whose
thought
was
far
from

of
the
lady
betook
himself
to
her
without
any
delay
and
at
her
bidding
seated
himself
by
her
side
on
a
couch
then
they
being
alone
together
he
twice
asked
her
the
occasion
for
which
she
had
caused

come
thither

she
made
him
no

last
urged
by
love
and
grown
all
vermeil
for
shame
well
nigh
in
tears
and
all
trembling
with
broken
speech
she
thus
began
to
say
and
sweet
friend
and
my
lord
you
may
easily
as
a
man
of
understanding
apprehend
how
great
is
the
frailty
both
of
men
and
of
women
and
that
more
for
divers
reasons
in
one
than
in
another
wherefore
at
the
hands
of
a
just
judge
the
same
sin
in
diverse
kinds
of
qualities
of
persons
should
not
in
equity
receive
one
same
punishment

who
is
there
will
deny

it
behoveth

which
is
needful

luxurious

should
furnish
forth
a
very
great

rise
up
in

afford

shall

it

have

many

overcome

overcome

say
nothing
of
weak
women

enjoying
the
commodities
and
the
leisures
wherein
you
see
me
i
have
suffered
myself
lapse
into
ensuing
love
his
pleasures
and
becoming
enamoured
the
which
albeit
were
it
known
i
acknowledge
it
would
not
be
seemly
yet
being
and
abiding
hidden
i
hold
well
nigh
nothing
unseemly
more
by
token
that
love
hath
been
insomuch
gracious
to
me
that
not
only
hath
he
not
bereft
me
of
due
discernment
in
the
choice
of
a
lover
but
hath
lent
me
great
plenty
thereof
to
that
end
showing
me
yourself
worthy
to
be
loved
of
a
lady
such
as
i
you
whom
if
my
fancy
beguile
me
not
i
hold
the
goodliest

most
agreeable

sprightliest

the
most
accomplished
cavalier

may
be
found
in

even
as
i
may
say
that
i
find
myself

you

i
pray
you
by
the
great

deny

love

bosom
the

was

with

up
and
departing
the
chamber

the

as
quickliest

to
his

without

he
set
his

mounting

off

seeing
her
in

plight
and
hearing
her
account
of
the
cause
of
her
outcry
not
only
gave
credence
to
her
words

added
that
the
count
gallant
bearing
and
debonair
address
had
long
been
used
by
him
to
win
to
that
end
accordingly
they
ran
in

to
his

to
arrest
him

presently

woeful
for
that

reached

hastily
over

betook
himself
in

to
london

ere

entered
with
many
words
he
lessoned
his
two
little
children
and
especially
in
two
things
first
that
they
should
brook
with
patience
the
poor
estate
whereunto
without
their
fault
fortune
had
brought
them
together
with
himself
and
after
that
with
all
wariness
they
should
keep
themselves
from
ever
discovering

any
whence

they
were

showed
it
thereafter
by
deed
that
this
might
be
the
better
done

deemed
it
well
to
change
their
names
wherefore
he
named
the
boy
perrot

the
girl
jeannette

three
entering

clad

themselves
to

being
on

one
morning
at
a
church
door
it
chanced
that
a
certain
great
lady
the
wife
of
one
of
the
king
marshals
of
england
coming
forth
of
the
church
saw
the
count
and
his
two
little
ones
asking
alms
and
questioned
him
whence
he
was
and
if
the
children
were
his
to
which
he
replied
that
he
was
from
picardy
and
that
by
reason
of
the
misfeasance
of
a
rakehelly
elder
son
of
his
it
had
behoved
him
depart
the
country
with
these
two
who
were
his
the
lady
who
was
pitiful
cast
her
eyes
on
the
girl
and
being
much
taken
with
her
for
that
she
was
handsome
and
engaging
said
man
an
thou
be
content
to
leave
thy
daughter
with
me
i
will
willingly
take
her
for
that
she
hath
a
good
favour
and
if
she
prove
an
honest
woman
i
will
in
due
time
marry
her
on
such
wise
that
she
shall
fare
well
this
offer
was
very
pleasing
to
the
count
who
promptly
answered
and
with
tears
gave
up
the
girl
to
the
lady
urgently
commending
her
to
her
care
having
thus
disposed
of
his
daughter
well
knowing
to
whom
he
resolved
to
abide
there
no
longer
and
accordingly
begging
his
way
across
the
island
came
not
without
sore
fatigue
as
one
who
was
unused
to
go
afoot
into
wales
here
dwelt
another
of
the
marshals
who
held
great
state
and
entertained
a
numerous
household
and
to
his
court
both
the
count
and
his
son
whiles
much
resorted
to
get
food
certain
sons
of
the
said
marshal
and
other
children
being
there
engaged
in
such
boyish
exercises
as
running
and
leaping
perrot
began
to
mingle
with
them
and
to
do
as
dextrously
as
any
of
the
rest
or
more
so
each
feat
that
was
practised
among
them
the
marshal
chancing
whiles
to
see
this
and
being
much
taken
with
the
manners
and
fashion
of
the
boy
asked
who
he
was
and
was
told
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
poor
man
who
came
there
bytimes
for
alms
whereupon
he
caused
require
him
of
the
count
and
the
latter
who
indeed
besought
god
of
nought
else
freely
resigned
the
boy
to
him
grievous
as
it
was
to
him
to
be
parted
from
him
having
thus
provided
his
son
and
daughter
he
determined
to
abide
no
longer
in
england
and
passing
over
into
ireland
made
his
way
as
best
he
might
to
stamford
where
he
took
service
with
a
knight
belonging
to
an
earl
of
the
country
doing
all
such
things
as
pertain
unto
a
lackey
or
a
horseboy
and
there
without
being
known
of
any
he
abode
a
great
while
in
unease
and
travail
galore
meanwhile
violante
called
jeannette
went
waxing
with
the
gentlewoman
in
london
in
years
and
person
and
beauty
and
was
in
such
favour
both
with
the
lady
and
her
husband
and
with
every
other
of
the
house
and
whoso
else
knew
her
that
it
was
a
marvellous
thing
to
see
nor
was
there
any
who
noted
her
manners
and
fashions
but
avouched
her
worthy
of
every
greatest
good
and
honour
wherefore
the
noble
lady
who
had
received
her
from
her
father
without
having
ever
availed
to
learn
who
he
was
otherwise
than
as
she
had
heard
from
himself
was
purposed
to
marry
her
honourably
according
to
that
condition
whereof
she
deemed
her
but
god
who
is
a
just
observer
of
folk
deserts
knowing
her
to
be
of
noble
birth
and
to
bear
without
fault
the
penalty
of
sin
ordained
otherwise
and
fain
must
we
believe
that
he
of
his
benignity
permitted
that
which
came
to
pass
to
the
end
that
the
gentle
damsel
might
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
man
of
low
estate
the
noble
lady
with
whom
jeannette
dwelt
had
of
her
husband
one
only
son
whom
both
she
and
his
father
loved
with
an
exceeding
love
both
for
that
he
was
their
child
and
that
he
deserved
it
by
reason
of
his
worth
and
virtues
he
being
some
six
years
older
than
jeannette
and
seeing
her
exceeding
fair
and
graceful
became
so
sore
enamoured
of
her
that
he
saw
nought
beyond
her
yet
for
that
he
deemed
her
to
be
of
mean
extraction
not
only
dared
he
not
demand
her
of
his
father
and
mother
to
wife
but
fearing
to
be
blamed
for
having
set
himself
to
love
unworthily
he
held
his
love
as
most
he
might
hidden
wherefore
it
tormented
him
far
more
than
if
he
had
discovered
it
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
for
excess
of
chagrin
he
fell
sick
and
that
grievously
divers
physicians
were
called
in
to
medicine
him
who
having
noted
one
and
another
symptom
of
his
case
and
being
nevertheless
unable
to
discover
what
ailed
him
all
with
one
accord
despaired
of
his
recovery
whereat
the
young
man
father
and
mother
suffered
dolour
and
melancholy
so
great
that
greater
might
not
be
brooked
and
many
a
time
with
piteous
prayers
they
questioned
him
of
the
cause
of
his
malady
whereto
or
sighs
he
gave
for
answer
or
replied
that
he
felt
himself
all
wasting
away
it
chanced
one
day
that
what
while
a
doctor
young
enough
but
exceedingly
deeply
versed
in
science
sat
by
him
and
held
him
by
the
arm
in
that
part
where
leaches
use
to
seek
the
pulse
jeannette
who
of
regard
for
his
mother
tended
him
solicitously
entered
on
some
occasion
or
another
the
chamber
where
the
young
man
lay
when
the
latter
saw
her
without
word
said
or
gesture
made
he
felt
the
amorous
ardour
redouble
in
his
heart
wherefore
his
pulse
began
to
beat
stronglier
than
of
wont
the
which
the
leach
incontinent
noted
and
marvelling
abode
still
to
see
how
long
this
should
last
as
soon
as
jeannette
left
the
chamber
the
beating
abated
wherefore
it
seemed
to
the
physician
he
had
gotten
impartment
of
the
cause
of
the
young
ailment
and
after
waiting
awhile
he
let
call
jeannette
to
him
as
he
would
question
her
of
somewhat
still
holding
the
sick
man
by
the
arm
she
came
to
him
incontinent
and
no
sooner
did
she
enter
than
the
beating
of
the
youth
pulse
returned
and
she
being
gone
again
ceased
thereupon
it
seeming
to
the
physician
that
he
had
full
enough
assurance
he
rose
and
taking
the
young
man
father
and
mother
apart
said
to
them
healing
of
your
son
is
not
in
the
succour
of
physicians
but
abideth
in
the
hands
of
jeannette
whom
as
i
have
by
sure
signs
manifestly
recognized
the
young
man
ardently
loveth
albeit
for
all
i
can
see
she
is
unaware
thereof
you
know
now
what
you
have
to
do
if
his
life
be
dear
to
you
the
gentleman
and
his
lady
hearing
this
were
well
pleased
inasmuch
as
some
means
was
found
for
his
recoverance
albeit
it
irked
them
sore
that
the
means
in
question
should
be
that
whereof
they
misdoubted
them
to
wit
that
they
should
give
jeannette
to
their
son
to
wife
accordingly
the
physician
being
gone
they
went
into
the
sick
man
and
the
lady
bespoke
him
thus
mine
i
could
never
have
believed
that
thou
wouldst
keep
from
me
any
desire
of
thine
especially
seeing
thyself
pine
away
for
lack
thereof
for
that
thou
shouldst
have
been
and
shouldst
be
assured
that
there
is
nought
i
can
for
thy
contentment
were
it
even
less
than
seemly
which
i
would
not
do
as
for
myself
but
since
thou
hast
done
this
god
the
lord
hath
been
more
pitiful
over
thee
than
thou
thyself
and
that
thou
mayst
not
die
of
this
sickness
hath
shown
me
the
cause
of
thine
ill
which
is
no
otherwhat
than
excess
of
love
for
some
damsel
or
other
whoever
she
may
be
and
this
indeed
thou
needest
not
have
thought
shame
to
discover
for
that
thine
age
requireth
it
and
wert
thou
not
enamoured
i
should
hold
thee
of
very
little
account
wherefore
my
son
dissemble
not
with
me
but
in
all
security
discover
to
me
thine
every
desire
and
put
away
from
thee
the
melancholy
and
the
which
be
upon
thee
and
from
which
proceedeth
this
thy
sickness
and
take
comfort
and
be
assured
that
there
is
nothing
of
that
which
thou
mayst
impose
on
me
for
thy
satisfaction
but
i
will
do
it
to
the
best
of
my
power
as
she
who
loveth
thee
more
than
her
life
banish
shamefastness
and
fearfulness
and
tell
me
if
i
can
do
aught
to
further
thy
passion
and
if
thou
find
me
not
diligent
therein
or
if
i
bring
it
not
to
effect
for
thee
account
me
the
cruellest
mother
that
ever
bore
son
the
young
man
hearing
his
mother
words
was
at
first
abashed
but
presently
bethinking
himself
that
none
was
better
able
than
she
to
satisfy
his
wishes
he
put
away
shamefastness
and
said
thus
to
her
nothing
hath
wrought
so
effectually
with
me
to
keep
my
love
hidden
as
my
having
noted
of
most
folk
that
once
they
are
grown
in
years
they
choose
not
to
remember
them
of
having
themselves
been
young
but
since
in
this
i
find
you
reasonable
not
only
will
i
not
deny
that
to
be
true
which
you
say
you
have
observed
but
i
will
to
boot
discover
to
you
of
whom
i
am
enamoured
on
condition
that
you
will
to
the
best
of
your
power
give
effect
to
your
promise
and
thus
may
you
have
me
whole
again
whereto
the
lady
trusting
overmuch
in
that
which
was
not
to
come
to
pass
for
her
on
such
wise
as
she
deemed
in
herself
answered
freely
that
he
might
in
all
assurance
discover
to
her
his
every
desire
for
that
she
would
without
any
delay
address
herself
to
contrive
that
he
should
have
his
pleasure
then
said
the
youth
exceeding
beauty
and
commendable
fashions
of
our
jeannette
and
my
unableness
to
make
her
even
sensible
still
less
to
move
her
to
pity
of
my
love
and
the
having
never
dared
to
discover
it
unto
any
have
brought
me
whereas
you
see
me
and
if
that
which
you
have
promised
me
come
not
one
way
or
another
to
pass
you
may
be
assured
that
my
life
will
be
brief
the
lady
to
whom
it
appeared
more
a
time
for
comfort
than
for
reproof
said
smilingly
my
son
hast
thou
then
for
this
suffered
thyself
to
languish
thus
take
comfort
and
leave
me
do
once
thou
shalt
be
recovered
the
youth
full
of
good
hope
in
a
very
short
time
showed
signs
of
great
amendment
whereas
the
lady
being
much
rejoiced
began
to
cast
about
how
she
might
perform
that
which
she
had
promised
him
accordingly
calling
jeannette
to
her
one
day
she
asked
her
very
civilly
as
by
way
of
a
jest
if
she
had
a
lover
whereupon
she
waxed
all
red
and
answered
it
concerneth
not
neither
were
it
seemly
in
a
poor
damsel
like
myself
banished
from
house
and
home
and
abiding
in
others
service
to
think
of
love
quoth
the
lady
you
have
no
lover
we
mean
to
give
you
one
in
whom
you
may
rejoice
and
live
merry
and
have
more
delight
of
your
beauty
for
it
behoveth
not
that
so
handsome
a
girl
as
you
are
abide
without
a
lover
to
this
jeannette
made
answer
you
took
me
from
my
father
poverty
and
have
reared
me
as
a
daughter
wherefore
it
behoveth
me
to
do
your
every
pleasure
but
in
this
i
will
nowise
comply
with
you
and
therein
methinketh
i
do
well
if
it
please
you
give
me
a
husband
him
do
i
purpose
to
love
but
none
other
for
that
since
of
the
inheritance
of
my
ancestors
nought
is
left
me
save
only
honour
this
latter
i
mean
to
keep
and
preserve
as
long
as
life
shall
endure
to
me
this
speech
seemed
to
the
lady
very
contrary
to
that
whereto
she
thought
to
come
for
the
keeping
of
her
promise
to
her
son
albeit
like
a
discreet
woman
as
she
was
she
inwardly
much
commended
the
damsel
therefor
and
she
said
now
jeannette
if
our
lord
the
king
who
is
a
young
cavalier
as
thou
art
a
very
fair
damsel
would
fain
have
some
easance
of
thy
love
wouldst
thou
deny
it
to
him
whereto
she
answered
forthright
king
might
do
me
violence
but
of
my
consent
he
should
never
avail
to
have
aught
of
me
save
what
was
honourable
the
lady
seeing
how
she
was
minded
left
parleying
with
her
and
bethought
herself
to
put
her
to
the
proof
wherefore
she
told
her
son
that
whenas
he
should
be
recovered
she
would
contrive
to
get
her
alone
with
him
in
a
chamber
so
he
might
make
shift
to
have
his
pleasure
of
her
saying
that
it
appeared
to
her
unseemly
that
she
should
plead
for
her
son
and
solicit
her
own
maid
with
this
the
young
man
was
nowise
content
and
presently
waxed
grievously
worse
which
when
his
mother
saw
she
opened
her
mind
to
jeannette
but
finding
her
more
constant
than
ever
recounted
what
she
had
done
to
her
husband
and
he
and
she
resolved
of
one
accord
grievous
though
it
seemed
to
them
to
give
her
to
him
to
wife
choosing
rather
to
have
their
son
alive
with
a
wife
unsorted
to
his
quality
than
dead
without
any
and
so
after
much
parley
they
did
whereat
jeannette
was
exceeding
content
and
with
a
devout
heart
rendered
thanks
to
god
who
had
not
forgotten
her
but
for
all
that
she
never
avouched
herself
other
than
the
daughter
of
a
picard
as
for
the
young
man
he
presently
recovered
and
celebrating
his
nuptials
the
gladdest
man
alive
proceeded
to
lead
a
merry
life
with
his
bride
meanwhile
perrot
who
had
been
left
in
wales
with
the
king
of
england
marshal
waxed
likewise
in
favour
with
his
lord
and
grew
up
very
goodly
of
his
person
and
doughty
as
any
man
in
the
island
insomuch
that
neither
in
tourneying
nor
jousting
nor
in
any
other
act
of
arms
was
there
any
in
the
land
who
could
cope
with
him
wherefore
he
was
everywhere
known
and
famous
under
the
name
of
perrot
the
picard
and
even
as
god
had
not
forgotten
his
sister
so
on
like
wise
he
showed
that
he
had
him
also
in
mind
for
that
a
pestilential
sickness
being
come
into
those
parts
carried
off
well
nigh
half
the
people
thereof
besides
that
most
part
of
those
who
survived
fled
for
fear
into
other
lands
wherefore
the
whole
country
appeared
desert
in
this
mortality
the
marshal
his
lord
and
his
lady
and
only
son
together
with
many
others
brothers
and
nephews
and
kinsmen
all
died
nor
was
any
left
of
all
his
house
save
a
daughter
just
and
perrot
with
sundry
other
serving
folk
the
pestilence
being
somewhat
abated
the
young
lady
with
the
approof
and
by
the
counsel
of
some
few
gentlemen
of
the
country
left
alive
took
perrot
for
that
he
was
a
man
of
worth
and
prowess
to
husband
and
made
him
lord
of
all
that
had
fallen
to
her
by
inheritance
nor
was
it
long
ere
the
king
of
england
hearing
the
marshal
to
be
dead
and
knowing
the
worth
of
perrot
the
picard
substituted
him
in
the
dead
man
room
and
made
him
his
marshal
this
in
brief
is
what
came
of
the
two
innocent
children
of
the
count
of
antwerp
left
by
him
for
lost
footnote
countrymen
but
boccaccio
evidently
uses
the
word
in
the
sense
of
vassals
eighteen
years
were
now
passed
since
the
count
flight
from
paris
when
as
he
abode
in
ireland
having
suffered
many
things
in
a
very
sorry
way
of
life
there
took
him
a
desire
to
learn
as
he
might
what
was
come
of
his
children
wherefore
seeing
himself
altogether
changed
of
favour
from
that
which
he
was
wont
to
be
and
feeling
himself
for
long
exercise
grown
more
robust
of
his
person
than
he
had
been
when
young
and
abiding
in
ease
and
idlesse
he
took
leave
of
him
with
whom
he
had
so
long
abidden
and
came
poor
and
ill
enough
in
case
to
england
thence
he
betook
himself
whereas
he
had
left
perrot
and
found
him
a
marshal
and
a
great
lord
and
saw
him
robust
and
goodly
of
person
the
which
was
mighty
pleasing
unto
him
but
he
would
not
make
himself
known
to
him
till
he
should
have
learned
how
it
was
with
jeannette
accordingly
he
set
out
and
stayed
not
till
he
came
to
london
where
cautiously
enquiring
of
the
lady
with
whom
he
had
left
his
daughter
and
of
her
condition
he
found
jeannette
married
to
her
son
which
greatly
rejoiced
him
and
he
counted
all
his
past
adversity
a
little
thing
since
he
had
found
his
children
again
alive
and
in
good
case
then
desirous
of
seeing
jeannette
he
began
beggarwise
to
haunt
the
neighbourhood
of
her
house
where
one
day
jamy
lamiens
for
so
was
jeannette
husband
called
espying
him
and
having
compassion
on
him
for
that
he
saw
him
old
and
poor
bade
one
of
his
servants
bring
him
in
and
give
him
to
eat
for
the
love
of
god
which
the
man
readily
did
now
jeannette
had
had
several
children
by
jamy
whereof
the
eldest
was
no
more
than
eight
years
old
and
they
were
the
handsomest
and
sprightliest
children
in
the
world
when
they
saw
the
count
eat
they
came
one
and
all
about
him
and
began
to
caress
him
as
if
moved
by
some
occult
virtue
they
divined
him
to
be
their
grandfather
he
knowing
them
for
his
grandchildren
fell
to
fondling
and
making
much
of
them
wherefore
the
children
would
not
leave
him
albeit
he
who
had
charge
of
their
governance
called
them
jeannette
hearing
this
issued
forth
of
a
chamber
therenigh
and
coming
whereas
the
count
was
chid
them
amain
and
threatened
to
beat
them
an
they
did
not
what
their
governor
willed
the
children
began
to
weep
and
say
that
they
would
fain
abide
with
that
honest
man
who
loved
them
better
than
their
governor
whereat
both
the
lady
and
the
count
laughed
now
the
latter
had
risen
nowise
as
a
father
but
as
a
poor
man
to
do
honour
to
his
daughter
as
to
a
mistress
and
seeing
her
felt
a
marvellous
pleasure
at
his
heart
but
she
nor
then
nor
after
knew
him
any
whit
for
that
he
was
beyond
measure
changed
from
what
he
was
used
to
be
being
grown
old
and
hoar
and
bearded
and
lean
and
swart
and
appeared
altogether
another
man
than
the
count
the
lady
then
seeing
that
the
children
were
unwilling
to
leave
him
and
wept
when
she
would
have
them
go
away
bade
their
governor
let
them
be
awhile
and
the
children
thus
being
with
the
good
man
it
chanced
that
jamy
father
returned
and
heard
from
their
governor
what
had
passed
whereupon
quoth
the
marshal
who
held
jeannette
in
despite
them
be
god
give
them
they
do
but
hark
back
to
that
whence
they
sprang
they
come
by
their
mother
of
a
vagabond
and
therefore
it
is
no
wonder
if
they
are
fain
to
herd
with
vagabonds
the
count
heard
these
words
and
was
mightily
chagrined
thereat
nevertheless
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
up
with
the
affront
even
as
he
had
put
up
with
many
others
jamy
hearing
how
the
children
had
welcomed
the
honest
man
to
wit
the
count
albeit
it
misliked
him
nevertheless
so
loved
them
that
rather
than
see
them
weep
he
commanded
that
if
the
good
man
chose
to
abide
there
in
any
capacity
he
should
be
received
into
his
service
the
count
answered
that
he
would
gladly
abide
there
but
he
knew
not
to
do
aught
other
than
tend
horses
whereto
he
had
been
used
all
his
lifetime
a
horse
was
accordingly
assigned
to
him
and
when
he
had
cared
for
it
he
busied
himself
with
making
sport
for
the
children
whilst
fortune
handled
the
count
of
antwerp
and
his
children
on
such
wise
as
hath
been
set
out
it
befell
that
the
king
of
france
after
many
truces
made
with
the
germans
died
and
his
son
whose
wife
was
she
through
whom
the
count
had
been
banished
was
crowned
in
his
place
and
no
sooner
was
the
current
truce
expired
than
he
again
began
a
very
fierce
war
to
his
aid
the
king
of
england
as
a
kinsman
despatched
much
people
under
the
commandment
of
perrot
his
marshal
and
jamy
lamiens
son
of
the
other
marshal
and
with
them
went
the
good
man
to
wit
the
count
who
without
being
recognized
of
any
abode
a
pretty
while
with
the
army
in
the
guise
of
a
horseboy
and
there
like
a
man
of
mettle
as
he
was
wrought
good
galore
more
than
was
required
of
him
both
with
counsels
and
with
deeds
during
the
war
it
came
to
pass
that
the
queen
of
france
fell
grievously
sick
and
feeling
herself
nigh
unto
death
contrite
for
all
her
sins
confessed
herself
unto
the
archbishop
of
rouen
who
was
held
of
all
a
very
holy
and
good
man
amongst
her
other
sins
she
related
to
him
that
which
the
count
of
antwerp
had
most
wrongfully
suffered
through
her
nor
was
she
content
to
tell
it
to
him
alone
nay
but
before
many
other
men
of
worth
she
recounted
all
as
it
had
passed
beseeching
them
so
to
do
with
the
king
that
the
count
an
he
were
on
life
or
if
not
one
of
his
children
should
be
restored
to
his
estate
after
which
she
lingered
not
long
but
departing
this
life
was
honourably
buried
her
confession
being
reported
to
the
king
moved
him
after
he
had
heaved
divers
sighs
of
regret
for
the
wrong
done
to
the
nobleman
to
let
cry
throughout
all
the
army
and
in
many
other
parts
that
whoso
should
give
him
news
of
the
count
of
antwerp
or
of
either
of
his
children
should
for
each
be
guerdoned
of
him
for
that
he
held
him
upon
the
queen
confession
innocent
of
that
for
which
he
had
gone
into
exile
and
was
minded
to
restore
him
to
his
first
estate
and
more
the
count
in
his
guise
of
a
horseboy
hearing
this
and
being
assured
that
it
was
the
truth
betook
himself
forthright
to
jamy
lamiens
and
prayed
him
go
with
him
to
perrot
for
that
he
had
a
mind
to
discover
to
them
that
which
the
king
went
seeking
all
three
being
then
met
together
quoth
the
count
to
perrot
who
had
it
already
in
mind
to
discover
himself
jamy
here
hath
thy
sister
to
wife
nor
ever
had
any
dowry
with
her
wherefore
that
thy
sister
may
not
go
undowered
i
purpose
that
he
and
none
other
shall
by
making
thee
known
as
the
son
of
the
count
of
antwerp
have
this
great
reward
that
the
king
promiseth
for
thee
and
for
violante
thy
sister
and
his
wife
and
myself
who
am
the
count
of
antwerp
and
your
father
perrot
hearing
this
and
looking
steadfastly
upon
him
presently
knew
him
and
cast
himself
weeping
at
his
feet
and
embraced
him
saying
mine
you
are
dearly
welcome
jamy
hearing
first
what
the
count
said
and
after
seeing
what
perrot
did
was
overcome
at
once
with
such
wonderment
and
such
gladness
that
he
scarce
knew
what
he
should
do
however
after
awhile
giving
credence
to
the
former
speech
and
sore
ashamed
for
the
injurious
words
he
had
whiles
used
to
the
he
let
himself
fall
weeping
at
his
feet
and
humbly
besought
him
pardon
of
every
past
affront
the
which
the
count
having
raised
him
to
his
feet
graciously
accorded
him
footnote
that
it
was
not
a
snare
then
after
they
had
all
three
discoursed
awhile
of
each
one
various
adventures
and
wept
and
rejoiced
together
amain
perrot
and
jamy
would
have
reclad
the
count
who
would
on
nowise
suffer
it
but
willed
that
jamy
having
first
assured
himself
of
the
promised
guerdon
should
the
more
to
shame
the
king
present
him
to
the
latter
in
that
his
then
plight
and
in
his
groom
habit
accordingly
jamy
followed
by
the
count
and
perrot
presented
himself
before
the
king
and
offered
provided
he
would
guerdon
him
according
to
the
proclamation
made
to
produce
to
him
the
count
and
his
children
the
king
promptly
let
bring
for
all
three
a
guerdon
marvellous
in
jamy
eyes
and
commanded
that
he
should
be
free
to
carry
it
off
whenas
he
should
in
very
deed
produce
the
count
and
his
children
as
he
promised
jamy
then
turning
himself
about
and
putting
forward
the
count
his
horseboy

said

the
son

is
my
wife
and
who
is
not
here
with
god
aid
you
shall
soon
see
the
king
hearing
this
looked
at
the
count
and
albeit
he
was
sore
changed
from
that
which
he
was
used
to
be
yet
after
he
had
awhile
considered
him
he
knew
him
and
well
nigh
with
tears
in
his
eyes
raised
him
for
that
he
was
on
his
knees
before
him
to
his
feet
and
kissed
and
embraced
him
perrot
also
he
graciously
received
and
commanded
that
the
count
should
incontinent
be
furnished
anew
with
clothes
and
servants
and
horses
and
harness
according
as
his
quality
required
which
was
straightway
done
moreover
he
entreated
jamy
with
exceeding
honour
and
would
fain
know
every
particular
of
his
past
adventures
then
jamy
being
about
to
receive
the
magnificent
guerdons
appointed
him
for
having
discovered
the

his

thy

accordingly
took
the

and
sent
for
his

to

came

there
they
all

the

constantly
used

the

in

sense

there
were
once
at
paris
in
an
inn
certain
very
considerable
italian
merchants
who
were
come
thither
according
to
their
usance
some
on
one
occasion
and
some
on
another
and
having
one
evening
among
others
supped
all
together
merrily
they
fell
to
devising
of
divers
matters
and
passing
from
one
discourse
to
another
they
came
at
last
to
speak
of
their
wives
whom
they
had
left
at
home
and
one
said
jestingly
know
not
how
mine

this
i

well
nigh
to
the
same
conclusion
and
in
brief
all
seemed
agreed
upon
this
point
that
the
wives
they
left
behind
had
no
mind
to
lose
time
in
their
husbands
absence
one
only
who
hight
bernabo
lomellini
of
genoa
maintained
the
contrary
avouching
that
he
by
special
grace
of
god
had
a
lady
to
wife
who
was
belike
the
most
accomplished
woman
of
all
italy
in
all
those
qualities
which
a
lady
nay
even
in
great
part
in
those
which
a
knight
or
an
esquire
should
have
for
that
she
was
fair
of
favour
and
yet
in
her
first
youth
and
adroit
and
robust
of
her
person
nor
was
there
aught
that
pertaineth
unto
a
woman
such
as
works
of
broidery
in
silk
and
the
like
but
she
did
it
better
than
any
other
of
her
sex
moreover
said
he
there
was
no
sewer
or
in
other
words
no
alive
who
served
better
or
more
deftly
at
a
nobleman
table
than
did
she
for
that
she
was
very
well
bred
and
exceeding
wise
and
discreet
he
after
went
on
to
extol
her
as
knowing
better
how
to
ride
a
horse
and
fly
a
hawk
to
read
and
write
and
cast
a
reckoning
than
if
she
were
a
merchant
and
thence
after
many
other
commendations
coming
to
that
whereof
it
had
been
discoursed
among
them
he
avouched
with
an
oath
that
there
could
be
found
no
honester
nor
chaster
woman
than
she
wherefore
he
firmly
believed
that
should
he
abide
half
a
score
years
or
even
always
from
home
she
would
never
incline
to
the
least
levity
with
another
man
among
the
merchants
who
discoursed
thus
was
a
young
man
called
ambrogiuolo
of
piacenza
who
fell
to
making
the
greatest
mock
in
the
world
of
this
last
commendation
bestowed
by
bernabo
upon
his
wife
and
asked
him
scoffingly
if
the
emperor
had
granted
him
that
privilege
over
and
above
all
other
men
bernabo
some
little
nettled
replied
that
not
the
emperor
but
god
who
could
somewhat
more
than
the
emperor
had
vouchsafed
him
the
favour
in
question
whereupon
quoth
ambrogiuolo
i
doubt
not
a
whit
but
that
thou
thinkest
to
say
sooth
but
meseemeth
thou
hast
paid
little
regard
to
the
nature
of
things
for
that
hadst
thou
taken
heed
thereunto
i
deem
thee
not
so
dull
of
wit
but
thou
wouldst
have
noted
therein
certain
matters
which
had
made
thee
speak
more
circumspectly
on
this
subject
and
that
thou
mayst
not
think
that
we
who
have
spoken
much
at
large
of
our
wives
believe
that
we
have
wives
other
or
otherwise
made
than
thine
but
mayst
see
that
we
spoke
thus
moved
by
natural
perception
i
will
reason
with
thee
a
little
on
this
matter
i
have
always
understood
man
to
be
the
noblest
animal
created
of
god
among
mortals
and
after
him
woman
but
man
as
is
commonly
believed
and
as
is
seen
by
works
is
the
more
perfect
and
having
more
perfection
must
without
fail
have
more
of
firmness
and
constancy
for
that
women
universally
are
more
changeable
the
reason
whereof
might
be
shown
by
many
natural
arguments
which
for
the
present
i
purpose
to
leave
be
if
then
man
be
of
more
stability
and
yet
can
not
keep
himself
let
alone
from
complying
with
a
woman
who
soliciteth
him
but
even
from
desiring
one
who
pleaseth
him
nay
more
from
doing
what
he
can
so
he
may
avail
to
be
with
her
and
if
this
betide
him
not
once
a
month
but
a
thousand
times
a
day
what
canst
thou
expect
a
woman
naturally
unstable
to
avail
against
the
prayers
the
blandishments
the
gifts
and
a
thousand
other
means
which
an
adroit
man
who
loveth
her
will
use
thinkest
thou
she
can
hold
out
certes
how
much
soever
thou
mayst
affirm
it
i
believe
not
that
thou
believest
it
and
thou
thyself
sayst
that
thy
wife
is
a
woman
and
that
she
is
of
flesh
and
blood
as
are
other
women
if
this
be
so
those
same
desires
must
be
hers
and
the
same
powers
that
are
in
other
women
to
resist
these
natural
appetites
wherefore
however
honest
she
be
it
is
possible
she
may
do
that
which
other
women
do
and
nothing
that
is
possible
she
be
so
peremptorily
denied
nor
the
contrary
thereof
affirmed
with
such
rigour
as
thou
dost
to
which
bernabo
made
answer
saying
am
a
merchant
and
not
a
philosopher
and
as
a
merchant
i
will
answer
and
i
say
that
i
acknowledge
that
what
thou
sayst
may
happen
to
foolish
women
in
whom
there
is
no
shame
but
those
who
are
discreet
are
so
careful
of
their
honour
that
for
the
guarding
thereof
they
become
stronger
than
men
who
reck
not
of
this
and
of
those
thus
fashioned
is
my
wife
rejoined
ambrogiuolo
for
every
time
they
occupy
themselves
with
toys
of
this
kind
there
sprouted
from
their
foreheads
a
horn
to
bear
witness
of
that
which
they
have
done
there
be
few
i
believe
who
would
incline
thereto
but
far
from
the
horn
sprouting
there
appeareth
neither
trace
nor
token
thereof
in
those
who
are
discreet
and
shame
and
soil
of
honour
consist
not
but
in
things
discovered
wherefore
whenas
they
may
secretly
they
do
it
or
if
they
forebear
it
is
for
stupidity
and
have
thou
this
for
certain
that
she
alone
is
chaste
who
hath
either
never
been
solicited
of
any
or
who
having
herself
solicited
hath
not
been
hearkened
and
although
i
know
by
natural
and
true
reasons
that
it
is
as
i
say
yet
should
i
not
speak
thereof
with
so
full
an
assurance
had
i
not
many
a
time
and
with
many
women
made
essay
thereof
and
this
i
tell
thee
that
were
i
near
this
most
sanctified
wife
of
thine
i
warrant
me
i
would
in
brief
space
of
time
bring
her
to
that
which
i
have
already
gotten
of
other
women
whereupon
quoth
bernabo
with
words
might
be
prolonged
without
end
thou
wouldst
say
and
i
should
say
and
in
the
end
it
would
all
amount
to
nothing
but
since
thou
wilt
have
it
that
all
women
are
so
compliant
and
that
thine
address
is
such
i
am
content
so
i
may
certify
thee
of
my
honesty
to
have
my
head
cut
off
and
thou
canst
anywise
avail
to
bring
her
to
do
thy
pleasure
in
aught
of
the
kind
and
if
thou
fail
thereof
i
will
have
thee
lose
no
otherwhat
than
a
thousand
gold
florins
replied
ambrogiuolo
who
was
now
grown
heated
over
the
dispute
know
not
what
i
should
do
with
thy
blood
if
i
won
the
wager
but
an
thou
have
a
mind
to
see
proof
of
that
which
i
have
advanced
do
thou
stake
five
thousand
gold
florins
of
thy
monies
which
should
be
less
dear
to
thee
than
thy
head
against
a
thousand
of
mine
and
whereas
thou
settest
no
limit
of
time
i
will
bind
myself
to
go
to
genoa
and
within
three
months
from
the
day
of
my
departure
hence
to
have
done
my
will
of
thy
wife
and
to
bring
back
with
me
in
proof
thereof
sundry
of
her
most
precious
things
and
such
and
so
many
tokens
that
thou
shalt
thyself
confess
it
to
be
truth
so
verily
thou
wilt
pledge
me
thy
faith
not
to
come
to
genoa
within
that
term
nor
write
her
aught
of
the
matter
bernabo
said
that
it
liked
him
well
and
albeit
the
other
merchants
endeavoured
to
hinder
the
affair
foreseeing
that
sore
mischief
might
come
thereof
the
two
merchants
minds
were
so
inflamed
that
in
despite
of
the
rest
they
bound
themselves
one
to
other
by
express
writings
under
their
hands
this
done
bernabo
abode
behind
whilst
ambrogiuolo
as
quickliest
he
might
betook
himself
to
genoa
there
he
abode
some
days
and
informing
himself
with
the
utmost
precaution
of
the
name
of
the
street
where
the
lady
dwelt
and
of
her
manner
of
life
understood
of
her
that
and
more
than
that
which
he
had
heard
of
her
from
bernabo
wherefore
himseemed
he
was
come
on
a
fool
errand
however
he
presently
clapped
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
poor
woman
who
was
much
about
the
house
and
whose
great
the
lady
was
and
availing
not
to
induce
her
to
aught
else
he
debauched
her
with
money
and
prevailed
with
her
to
bring
him
in
a
chest
wroughten
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
not
only
into
the
house
but
into
the
gentlewoman
very
bedchamber
where
according
to
the
ordinance
given
her
of
him
the
good
woman
commended
it
to
her
care
for
some
days
as
if
she
had
a
mind
to
go
somewhither
the
chest
then
being
left
in
the
chamber
and
the
night
come
ambrogiuolo
what
time
he
judged
the
lady
to
be
asleep
opened
the
chest
with
certain
engines
of
his
and
came
softly
out
into
the
chamber
where
there
was
a
light
burning
with
whose
aid
he
proceeded
to
observe
the
ordinance
of
the
place
the
paintings
and
every
other
notable
thing
that
was
therein
and
fixed
them
in
his
memory
then
drawing
near
the
bed
and
perceiving
that
the
lady
and
a
little
girl
who
was
with
her
were
fast
asleep
he
softly
altogether
uncovered
the
former
and
found
that
she
was
as
fair
naked
as
clad
but
saw
no
sign
about
her
that
he
might
carry
away
save
one
to
wit
a
mole
which
she
had
under
the
left
pap
and
about
which
were
sundry
little
hairs
as
red
as
gold
this
noted
he
covered
her
softly
up
again
albeit
seeing
her
so
fair
he
was
tempted
to
adventure
his
life
and
lay
himself
by
her
side
however
for
that
he
had
heard
her
to
be
so
obdurate
and
uncomplying
in
matters
of
this
kind
he
hazarded
not
himself
but
abiding
at
his
leisure
in
the
chamber
the
most
part
of
the
night
took
from
one
of
her
coffers
a
purse
and
a
together
with
sundry
rings
and
girdles
and
laying
them
all
in
his
chest
returned
thither
himself
and
shut
himself
up
therein
as
before
and
on
this
wise
he
did
two
nights
without
the
lady
being
ware
of
aught
on
the
third
day
the
good
woman
came
back
for
the
chest
according
to
the
given
ordinance
and
carried
it
off
whence
she
had
taken
it
whereupon
ambrogiuolo
came
out
and
having
rewarded
her
according
to
promise
returned
as
quickliest
he
might
with
the
things
aforesaid
to
paris
where
he
arrived
before
the
term
appointed
there
he
summoned
the
merchants
who
had
been
present
at
the
dispute
and
the
laying
of
the
wager
and
declared
in
bernabo
presence
that
he
had
won
the
wager
laid
between
them
for
that
he
had
accomplished
that
whereof
he
had
vaunted
himself
and
to
prove
this
to
be
true
he
first
described
the
fashion
of
the
chamber
and
the
paintings
thereof
and
after
showed
the
things
he
had
brought
with
him
thence
avouching
that
he
had
them
of
herself
bernabo
confessed
the
chamber
to
be
as
he
had
said
and
owned
moreover
that
he
recognized
the
things
in
question
as
being
in
truth
his
wife
but
said
that
he
might
have
learned
from
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
the
fashion
of
the
chamber
and
have
gotten
the
things
in
like
manner
wherefore
an
he
had
nought
else
to
say
himseemed
not
that
this
should
suffice
to
prove
him
to
have
won
whereupon
quoth
ambrogiuolo
sooth
this
should
suffice
but
since
thou
wilt
have
me
say
more
i
will
say
it
i
tell
thee
that
madam
ginevra
thy
wife
hath
under
her
left
pap
a
pretty
big
mole
about
which
are
maybe
half
a
dozen
little
hairs
as
red
as
gold
when
bernabo
heard
this
it
was
as
if
he
had
gotten
a
in
the
heart
such
anguish
did
he
feel
and
though
he
had
said
not
a
word
his
countenance
being
all
changed
gave
very
manifest
token
that
what
ambrogiuolo
said
was
true
then
after
awhile
quoth
he
which
ambrogiuolo
saith
is
true
wherefore
he
having
won
let
him
come
whenassoever
it
pleaseth
him
and
he
shall
be
paid
accordingly
on
the
ensuing
day
ambrogiuolo
was
paid
in
full
and
bernabo
departing
paris
betook
himself
to
genoa
with
fell
intent
against
the
lady
when
he
drew
near
the
city
he
would
not
enter
therein
but
lighted
down
a
good
score
miles
away
at
a
country
house
of
his
and
despatched
one
of
his
servants
in
whom
he
much
trusted
to
genoa
with
two
horses
and
letters
under
his
hand
advising
his
wife
that
he
had
returned
and
bidding
her
come
to
him
and
he
privily
charged
the
man
whenas
he
should
be
with
the
lady
in
such
place
as
should
seem
best
to
him
to
put
her
to
death
without
pity
and
return
to
him
the
servant
accordingly
repaired
to
genoa
and
delivering
the
letters
and
doing
his
errand
was
received
with
great
rejoicing
by
the
lady
who
on
the
morrow
took
horse
with
him
and
set
out
for
their
country
house
as
they
fared
on
together
discoursing
of
one
thing
and
another
they
came
to
a
very
deep
and
lonely
valley
beset
with
high
rocks
and
trees
which
seeming
to
the
servant
a
place
wherein
he
might
with
assurance
for
himself
do
his
lord
commandment
he
pulled
out
his
knife
and
taking
the
lady
by
the
arm
said
commend
your
soul
to
god
for
needs
must
you
die
without
faring
farther
the
lady
seeing
the
knife
and
hearing
these
words
was
all
dismayed
and
said
for
god
sake
ere
thou
slay
me
tell
me
wherein
i
have
offended
thee
that
thou
wouldst
put
me
to
death
answered
the
man
you
have
nowise
offended
but
wherein
you
have
offended
your
husband
i
know
not
save
that
he
hath
commanded
me
slay
you
by
the
way
without
having
any
pity
upon
you
threatening
me
an
i
did
it
not
to
have
me
hanged
by
the
neck
you
know
well
how
much
i
am
beholden
to
him
and
how
i
may
not
gainsay
him
in
aught
that
he
may
impose
upon
me
god
knoweth
it
irketh
me
for
you
but
i
can
no
otherwise
whereupon
quoth
the
lady
weeping
for
god
sake
consent
not
to
become
the
murderer
of
one
who
hath
never
wronged
thee
to
serve
another
god
who
knoweth
all
knoweth
that
i
never
did
aught
for
which
i
should
receive
such
a
recompense
from
my
husband
but
let
that
be
thou
mayst
an
thou
wilt
at
once
content
god
and
thy
master
and
me
on
this
wise
to
wit
that
thou
take
these
my
clothes
and
give
me
but
thy
doublet
and
a
hood
and
with
the
former
return
to
my
lord
and
thine
and
tell
him
that
thou
hast
slain
me
and
i
swear
to
thee
by
that
life
which
thou
wilt
have
bestowed
on
me
that
i
will
remove
hence
and
get
me
gone
into
a
country
whence
never
shall
any
news
of
me
win
either
to
him
or
to
thee
or
into
these
parts
the
servant
who
was
loath
to
slay
her
was
lightly
moved
to
compassion
wherefore
he
took
her
clothes
and
give
her
a
sorry
doublet
of
his
and
a
hood
leaving
her
sundry
monies
she
had
with
her
then
praying
her
depart
the
country
he
left
her
in
the
valley
and
afoot
and
betook
himself
to
his
master
to
whom
he
avouched
that
not
only
was
his
commandment
accomplished
but
that
he
had
left
the
lady
dead
body
among
a
pack
of
wolves
and
bernabo
presently
returned
to
genoa
where
the
thing
becoming
known
he
was
much
blamed
as
for
the
lady
she
abode
alone
and
disconsolate
till
nightfall
when
she
disguised
herself
as
most
she
might
and
repaired
to
a
village
hard
by
where
having
gotten
from
an
old
woman
that
which
she
needed
she
fitted
the
doublet
to
her
shape
and
shortening
it
made
a
pair
of
linen
breeches
of
her
shift
then
having
cut
her
hair
and
altogether
transformed
herself
in
the
guise
of
a
sailor
she
betook
herself
to
the
where
as
chance
would
have
it
she
found
a
catalan
gentleman
by
name
senor
encararch
who
had
landed
at
alba
from
a
ship
he
had
in
the
offing
to
refresh
himself
at
a
spring
there
with
him
she
entered
into
parley
and
engaging
with
him
as
a
servant
embarked
on
board
the
ship
under
the
name
of
sicurano
da
finale
there
being
furnished
by
the
gentleman
with
better
clothes
she
proceeded
to
serve
him
so
well
and
so
aptly
that
she
became
in
the
utmost
favour
with
him
no
great
while
after
it
befell
that
the
catalan
made
a
voyage
to
alexandria
with
a
lading
of
his
and
carrying
thither
certain
peregrine
falcons
for
the
soldan
presented
them
to
him
the
soldan
having
once
and
again
entertained
him
at
meat
and
noting
with
approof
the
fashions
of
sicurano
who
still
went
serving
him
begged
him
of
his
master
who
yielded
him
to
him
although
it
irked
him
to
do
it
and
sicurano
in
a
little
while
by
his
good
behaviour
gained
the
love
and
favour
of
the
soldan
even
as
he
had
gained
that
of
the
catalan
wherefore
in
process
of
time
it
befell
that
the
time
coming
for
a
great
assemblage
in
the
guise
of
a
fair
of
merchants
both
christian
and
saracen
which
was
wont
at
a
certain
season
of
the
year
to
be
held
in
acre
a
town
under
the
seignory
of
the
soldan
and
to
which
in
order
that
the
merchants
and
their
merchandise
might
rest
secure
the
latter
was
still
used
to
despatch
besides
other
his
officers
some
one
of
his
chief
men
with
troops
to
look
to
the
guard
he
bethought
himself
to
send
sicurano
who
was
by
this
well
versed
in
the
language
of
the
country
on
this
service
and
so
he
did
sicurano
accordingly
came
to
acre
as
governor
and
captain
of
the
guard
of
the
merchants
and
their
merchandise
and
there
well
and
diligently
doing
that
which
pertained
to
his
office
and
going
round
looking
about
him
saw
many
merchants
there
sicilians
and
pisans
and
genoese
and
venetians
and
other
italians
with
whom
he
was
fain
to
make
acquaintance
in
remembrance
of
his
country
it
befell
one
time
amongst
others
that
having
lighted
down
at
the
shop
of
certain
venetian
merchants
he
espied
among
other
trinkets
a
purse
and
a
girdle
which
he
straightway
knew
for
having
been
his
and
marvelled
thereat
but
without
making
any
sign
he
carelessly
asked
to
whom
they
pertained
and
if
they
were
for
sale
now
ambrogiuolo
of
piacenza
was
come
thither
with
much
merchandise
on
board
a
venetian
ship
and
hearing
the
captain
of
the
guard
ask
whose
the
trinkets
were
came
forward
and
said
laughing
the
things
are
mine
and
i
do
not
sell
them
but
if
they
please
you
i
will
gladly
give
them
to
you
sicurano
seeing
him
laugh
misdoubted
he
had
recognized
him
by
some
gesture
of
his
but
yet
keeping
a
steady
countenance
he
said
thou
laughest
to
see
me
a
soldier
go
questioning
of
these
women
toys
answered
ambrogiuolo
laugh
not
at
that
nay
but
at
the
way
i
came
by
them
then
said
sicurano
it
be
not
unspeakable
tell
me
how
thou
gottest
them
so
god
give
thee
good
luck
quoth
ambrogiuolo
a
gentlewoman
of
genoa
hight
madam
ginevra
wife
of
bernabo
lomellini
gave
me
these
things
with
certain
others
one
night
that
i
lay
with
her
and
prayed
me
keep
them
for
the
love
of
her
now
i
laugh
for
that
i
mind
me
of
the
simplicity
of
bernabo
who
was
fool
enough
to
lay
five
thousand
florins
to
one
that
i
would
not
bring
his
wife
to
do
my
pleasure
the
which
i
did
and
won
the
wager
whereupon
he
who
should
rather
have
punished
himself
for
his
stupidity
than
her
for
doing
that
which
all
women
do
returned
from
paris
to
genoa
and
there
by
what
i
have
since
heard
caused
her
put
to
death
sicurano
hearing
this
understood
forthwith
what
was
the
cause
of
bernabo
anger
against
his
wife
and
manifestly
perceiving
this
fellow
to
have
been
the
occasion
of
all
her
ills
determined
not
to
let
him
go
unpunished
therefor
accordingly
he
feigned
to
be
greatly
diverted
with
the
story
and
artfully
clapped
up
a
strait
acquaintance
with
him
insomuch
that
the
fair
being
ended
ambrogiuolo
at
his
instance
accompanied
him
with
all
his
good
to
alexandria
here
sicurano
let
build
him
a
warehouse
and
lodged
in
his
hands
store
of
his
own
monies
and
ambrogiuolo
foreseeing
great
advantage
to
himself
willingly
took
up
his
abode
there
meanwhile
sicurano
careful
to
make
bernabo
clear
of
his
innocence
rested
not
till
by
means
of
certain
great
genoese
merchants
who
were
then
in
alexandria
he
had
on
some
plausible
occasion
of
his
own
devising
caused
him
come
thither
where
finding
him
in
poor
enough
case
he
had
him
privily
entertained
by
a
friend
of
his
against
it
should
seem
to
him
time
to
do
that
which
he
purposed
now
he
had
already
made
ambrogiuolo
recount
his
story
before
the
soldan
for
the
latter
diversion
but
seeing
bernabo
there
and
thinking
there
was
no
need
to
use
farther
delay
in
the
matter
he
took
occasion
to
procure
the
soldan
to
have
ambrogiuolo
and
bernabo
brought
before
him
and
in
the
latter
presence
to
extort
from
the
former
by
dint
of
severity
an
it
might
not
easily
be
done
by
other
means
the
truth
of
that
whereof
he
vaunted
himself
concerning
bernabo
wife
accordingly
they
both
being
come
the
soldan
in
the
presence
of
many
with
a
stern
countenance
commanded
ambrogiuolo
to
tell
the
truth
how
he
had
won
of
bernabo
the
five
thousand
gold
florins
and
sicurano
himself
in
whom
he
most
trusted
with
a
yet
angrier
aspect
threatened
him
with
the
most
grievous
torments
an
he
told
it
not
whereupon
ambrogiuolo
affrighted
on
one
side
and
another
and
in

constrained
in
the
presence
of
bernabo
and
many
others
plainly
related
everything
even
as
it
passed
expecting
no
worse
punishment
therefor
than
the
restitution
of
the
five
thousand
gold
florins
and
of
the
stolen
trinkets
he
having
spoken
sicurano
as
he
were
the
soldan
minister
in
the
matter
turned
to
bernabo
and
said
to
him
thou
what
didst
thou
to
thy
lady
for
this
lie
whereto
bernabo
replied
with
wrath
for
the
loss
of
my
money
and
with
resentment
for
the
shame
which
meseemed
i
had
gotten
from
my
wife
i
caused
a
servant
of
mine
put
her
to
death
and
according
to
that
which
he
reported
to
me
she
was
straightway
devoured
by
a
multitude
of
wolves
these
things
said
in
the
presence
of
the
soldan
and
all
heard
and
apprehended
of
him
albeit
he
knew
not
yet
to
what
end
sicurano
who
had
sought
and
ordered
this
would
fain
come
the
latter
said
to
him
lord
you
may
very
clearly
see
how
much
reason
yonder
poor
lady
had
to
vaunt
herself
of
her
gallant
and
her
husband
for
that
the
former
at
once
bereaved
her
of
honour
marring
her
fair
fame
with
lies
and
despoiled
her
husband
whilst
the
latter
more
credulous
of
others
falsehoods
than
of
the
truth
which
he
might
by
long
experience
have
known
caused
her
to
be
slain
and
eaten
of
wolves
and
moreover
such
is
the
goodwill
and
the
love
borne
her
by
the
one
and
the
other
that
having
long
abidden
with
her
neither
of
them
knoweth
her
but
that
you
may
the
better
apprehend
that
which
each
of
these
hath
deserved
i
will
so
but
you
vouchsafe
me
of
special
favour
to
punish
the
deceiver
and
pardon
the
dupe
cause
her
come
hither
into
your
and
their
presence
the
soldan
disposed
in
the
matter
altogether
to
comply
with
sicurano
wishes
answered
that
he
would
well
and
bade
him
produce
the
lady
whereat
bernabo
marvelled
exceedingly
for
that
he
firmly
believed
her
to
be
dead
whilst
ambrogiuolo
now
divining
his
danger
began
to
be
in
fear
of
worse
than
paying
of
monies
and
knew
not
whether
more
to
hope
or
to
fear
from
the
coming
of
the
lady
but
awaited
her
appearance
with
the
utmost
amazement
the
soldan
then
having
accorded
sicurano
his
wish
the
latter
threw
himself
weeping
on
his
knees
before
him
and
putting
off
as
it
were
at
one
and
the
same
time
his
manly
voice
and
masculine
demeanour
said
lord
i
am
the
wretched
misfortunate
ginevra
who
have
these
six
years
gone
wandering
in
man
disguise
about
the
world
having
been
foully
and
wickedly
aspersed
by
this
traitor
ambrogiuolo
and
given
by
yonder
cruel
and
unjust
man
to
one
of
his
servants
to
be
slain
and
eaten
of
wolves
then
tearing
open
the
fore
part
of
her
clothes
and
showing
her
breast
she
discovered
herself
to
the
soldan
and
all
else
who
were
present
and
after
turning
to
ambrogiuolo
indignantly
demanded
of
him
when
he
had
ever
lain
with
her
according
as
he
had
aforetime
boasted
but
he
now
knowing
her
and
fallen
well
nigh
dumb
for
shame
said
nothing
the
soldan
who
had
always
held
her
a
man
seeing
and
hearing
this
fell
into
such
a
wonderment
that
he
more
than
once
misdoubted
that
which
he
saw
and
heard
to
be
rather
a
dream
than
true
however
after
his
amazement
had
abated
apprehending
the
truth
of
the
matter
he
lauded
to
the
utmost
the
life
and
fashions
of
ginevra
till
then
called
sicurano
and
extolled
her
constancy
and
virtue
and
letting
bring
her
very
sumptuous
woman
apparel
and
women
to
attend
her
he
pardoned
bernabo
in
accordance
with
her
request
the
death
he
had
merited
whilst
the
latter
recognizing
her
cast
himself
at
her
feet
weeping
and
craving
forgiveness
which
she
ill
worthy
as
he
was
thereof
graciously
accorded
him
and
raising
him
to
his
feet
embraced
him
tenderly
as
her
husband
then
the
soldan
commanded
that
ambrogiuolo
should
incontinent
be
bound
to
a
stake
and
smeared
with
honey
and
exposed
to
the
sun
in
some
high
place
of
the
city
nor
should
ever
be
loosed
thence
till
such
time
as
he
should
fall
of
himself
and
so
was
it
done
after
this
he
commanded
that
all
that
had
belonged
to
him
should
be
given
to
the
lady
the
which
was
not
so
little
but
that
it
outvalued
ten
thousand
doubloons
moreover
he
let
make
a
very
goodly
banquet
wherein
he
entertained
bernabo
with
honour
as
madam
ginevra
husband
and
herself
as
a
very
valiant
lady
and
gave
her
in
jewels
and
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
and
monies
that
which
amounted
to
better
than
other
ten
thousand
doubloons
then
the
banquet
over
he
caused
equip
them
a
ship
and
gave
them
leave
to
return
at
their
pleasure
to
genoa
whither
accordingly
they
returned
with
great
joyance
and
exceeding
rich
and
there
they
were
received
with
the
utmost
honour
especially
madam
ginevra
who
was
of
all
believed
to
be
dead
and
who
while
she
lived
was
still
reputed
of
great
worth
and
virtue
as
for
ambrogiuolo
being
that
same
day
bounded
to
the
stake
and
anointed
with
honey
he
was
to
his
exceeding

not
only
slain

devoured

made

for

was
sacred
not

to
many
in

that

should
abstain

behoved
to
keep

with

like
as
he
did
bytimes
whilst
pleading
in
the
courts
of
civil
law
this
fashion
to
the
no

chagrin
of
the
lady
whom
he
handled
maybe
once
a
month
and
hardly

he
followed
a

while
still
keeping
strait
watch
over
her
lest
peradventure
some
other
should
teach
her
to
know
even
as
he
had
taught
her
holidays
things

thus
it
chanced
that
the
heat
being
great
and
messer
ricciardo
having
a
mind
to
go
to
a
very
fair
he
had
near
monte

and
there
abide
some
days
to
take
the
air
he
betook
himself
thither
carrying
with
him
his
fair
lady
there
sojourning
to
give
her
some
diversion
he
caused
one
day
fish
and
they
went
out
to
sea
in
two
boats
he
in
one
with
the
fishermen
and
she
in
another
with
other
ladies
the
sport
luring
them
on
they
drifted
some
miles
out
to
sea
well
nigh
without
perceiving
it
and
whilst
they
were
intent
upon
their
diversion
there
came
up
of
a
sudden
a
galliot
belonging
to
paganino
da
mare
a
famous
corsair
of
those
days
the
latter
espying
the
boats
made
for
them
nor
could
they
flee
so
fast
but
he
overtook
that
in
which
were
the
women
and
seeing
therein
the
judge
fair
lady
he
carried
her
aboard
the
galliot
in
full
sight
of
messer
ricciardo
who
was
now
come
to
land
and
made
off
without
recking
of
aught
else
when
my
lord
judge
who
was
so
jealous
that
he
misdoubted
of
the
very
air
saw
this
it
booteth
not
to
ask
if
he
was
chagrined
and
in
vain
both
at
pisa
and
otherwhere
did
he
complain
of
the
villainy
of
the
corsairs
for
that
he
knew
not
who
had
taken
his
wife
from
him
nor
whither
he
had
carried
her
as
for
paganino
finding
her
so
fair
he
deemed
himself
in
luck
and
having
no
wife
resolved
to
keep
her
for
himself
accordingly
seeing
her
weeping
sore
he
studied
to
comfort
her
with
soft
words
till
nightfall
when
his
calendar
having
dropped
from
his
girdle
and
saints
days
and
holidays
gone
clean
out
of
his
head
he
fell
to
comforting
her
with
deeds
himseeming
that
words
had
availed
little
by
day
and
after
such
a
fashion
did
he
console
her
that
ere
they
came
to
monaco
the
judge
and
his
ordinances
had
altogether
escaped
her
mind
and
she
began
to
lead
the
merriest
of
lives
with
paganino
the
latter
carried
her
to
monaco
and
there
over
and
above
the
consolations
with
which
he
plied
her
night
and
day
he
entreated
her
honourably
as
his
wife
after
awhile
it
came
to
messer
ears
where
his
wife
was
and
he
being
possessed
with
the
most
ardent
desire
to
have
her
again
and
bethinking
himself
that
none
other
might
thoroughly
suffice
to
do
what
was
needful
to
that
end
resolved
to
go
thither
himself
determined
to
spend
any
quantity
of
money
for
her
ransom
accordingly
he
set
out
by
sea
and
coming
to
monaco
there
both
saw
and
was
seen
of
the
lady
who
told
it
to
paganino
that
same
evening
and
acquainted
him
with
her
intent
next
morning
messer
ricciardo
seeing
paganino
accosted
him
and
quickly
clapped
up
a
great
familiarity
and
friendship
with
him
whilst
the
other
feigned
not
to
know
him
and
waited
to
see
at
what
he
aimed
accordingly
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
messer
ricciardo
discovered
to
him
as
best
and
most
civilly
he
knew
the
occasion
of
his
coming
and
prayed
him
take
what
he
pleased
and
restore
him
the
lady
to
which
paganino
made
answer
with
a
cheerful
countenance
you
are
welcome
and
to
answer
you
briefly
i
say
thus
it
is
true
i
have
a
young
lady
in
my
house
if
she
be
your
wife
or
another
i
know
not
for
that
i
know
you
not
nor
indeed
her
save
in
so
much
as
she
hath
abidden
awhile
with
me
if
you
be
as
you
say
her
husband
i
will
since
you
seem
to
me
a
civil
gentleman
carry
you
to
her
and
i
am
assured
that
she
will
know
you
right
well
if
she
say
it
is
as
you
avouch
and
be
willing
to
go
with
you
you
shall
for
the
sake
of
your
civility
give
me
what
you
yourself
will
to
her
ransom
but
an
it
be
not
so
you
would
do
ill
to
seek
to
take
her
from
me
for
that
i
am
a
young
man
and
can
entertain
a
woman
as
well
as
another
and
especially
such
an
one
as
she
who
is
the
most
pleasing
i
ever
saw
quoth
messer
ricciardo
certain
she
is
my
wife
an
thou
bring
me
where
she
is
thou
shalt
soon
see
it
for
she
will
incontinent
throw
herself
on
my
neck
wherefore
i
ask
no
better
than
that
it
be
as
thou
proposest
said
paganino
us
be
going
accordingly
they
betook
themselves
to
the
corsair
house
where
he
brought
the
judge
into
a
saloon
of
his
and
let
call
the
lady
who
issued
forth
of
a
chamber
all
dressed
and
tired
and
came
whereas
they
were
but
accosted
messer
ricciardo
no
otherwise
than
as
she
would
any
other
stranger
who
might
have
come
home
with

the
judge
who
looked
to
have
been
received
by
her
with
the
utmost
joy
marvelled
sore
at
this
and
fell
in
himself
the
chagrin
and
long
grief
i
have
suffered
since
i
lost
her
have
so
changed
me
that
she
knoweth
me
not
wherefore
he
said
to
her
it
hath
cost
me
dear
to
carry
thee
for
that
never
was
grief
felt
like
that
which
i
have
suffered
since
i
lost
thee
and
now
meseemeth
thou
knowest
me
not
so
distantly
dost
thou
greet
me
seest
thou

that
i
am
thine
own

come
hither
to
pay
that
which
this
gentleman
in
whose
house
we
are
shall
require
to
thy
ransom
and
to
carry
thee
away
and
he
of
his
favour
restoreth
thee
to
me
for
what
i
will
the
lady
turned
to
him
and
said
smiling
somewhat
you
to
me
sir
look
you
mistake
me
not
for
for
my
part
i
mind
me
not
ever
to
have
seen
you
quoth
ricciardo
what
thou
sayest
consider
me
well
an
thou
wilt
but
recollect
thyself
thou
wilt
see
that
i
am
thine
own
ricciardo
di
chinzica
answered
the
lady
will
pardon
me
belike
it
is
not
so
seemly
a
thing
as
you
imagine
for
me
to
look
much
on
you
nevertheless
i
have
seen
enough
of
you
to
know
that
i
never
before
set
eyes
on
you
ricciardo
concluding
that
she
did
this
for
fear
of
paganino
and
chose
not
to
confess
to
knowing
him
in
the
presence
besought
him
of
his
favour
that
he
might
speak
with
her
in
a
room
alone
paganino
replied
that
he
would
well
so
but
he
would
not
kiss
her
against
her
will
and
bade
the
lady
go
with
him
into
a
chamber
and
there
hear
what
he
had
to
say
and
answer
him
as
it
should
please
her
accordingly
the
lady
and
messer
ricciardo
went
into
a
room
apart
and
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
the
latter
began
to
say
heart
of
my
body
sweet
my
soul
and
my
hope
knowest
thou
not
thy
ricciardo
who
loveth
thee
more
than
himself
how
can
this
be
am
i
so
changed
prithee
fair
mine
eye
do
but
look
on
me
a
little
the
lady
began
to
laugh
and
without
letting
him
say
more
replied
may
be
assured
that
i
am
not
so
scatterbrained
but
that
i
know
well
enough
you
are
messer
ricciardo
di
chinzica
my
husband
but
what
time
i
was
with
you
you
showed
that
you
knew
me
very
ill
for
that
you
should
have
had
the
sense
to
see
that
i
was
young
and
lusty
and
gamesome
and
should
consequently
have
known
that
which
behoveth
unto
young
ladies
over
and
above
clothes
and
meat
albeit
for
shamefastness
they
name
it
not
the
which
how
you
performed
you
know
if
the
study
of
the
laws
was
more
agreeable
to
you
than
your
wife
you
should
not
have
taken
her
albeit
it
never
appeared
to
me
that
you
were
a
judge
nay
you
seemed
to
me
rather
a
common
crier
of
days
and
sacraments
and
fasts
and
vigils
so
well
you
knew
them
and
i
tell
you
this
that
had
you
suffered
the
husbandmen
who
till
your
lands
keep
as
many
holidays
as
you
allowed
him
who
had
the
tilling
of
my
poor
little
field
you
would
never
have
reaped
the
least
grain
of
corn
however
as
god
having
compassion
on
my
youth
hath
willed
it
i
have
happened
on
yonder
man
with
whom
i
abide
in
this
chamber
wherein
it
is
unknown
what
manner
of
thing
is
a
holiday
i
speak
of
those
holidays
which
you
more
assiduous
in
the
service
of
god
than
in
that
of
the
ladies
did
so
diligently
celebrate
nor
ever
yet
entered
in
at
this
door
saturday
nor
friday
nor
vigil
nor
emberday
nor
lent
that
is
so
long
nay
here
swink
we
day
and
night
and
thump
our
wool
and
this
very
night
after
matinsong
i
know
right
well
how
the
thing
went
once
he
was
up
wherefore
i
mean
to
abide
with
him
and
work
whilst
i
am
young
and
leave
saints
days
and
jubilees
and
fasts
for
my
keeping
when
i
am
old
so
get
you
gone
about
your
business
as
quickliest
you
may
good
luck
go
with
you
and
keep
as
many
holidays
as
you
please
without
me
messer
ricciardo
hearing
these
words
was
distressed
beyond
endurance
and
said
whenas
he
saw
she
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
sweet
my
soul
what
is
this
thou
sayest
hast
thou
no
regard
for
thy
kinsfolk
honour
and
thine
own
wilt
thou
rather
abide
here
for
this
man
whore
and
in
mortal
sin
than
at
pisa
as
my
wife
he
when
he
is
weary
of
thee
will
turn
thee
away
to
thine
own
exceeding
reproach
whilst
i
will
still
hold
thee
dear
and
still
though
i
willed
it
not
thou
shalt
be
mistress
of
my
house
wilt
thou
for
the
sake
of
a
lewd
and
disorderly
appetite
forsake
thine
honour
and
me
who
love
thee
more
than
my
life
for
god
sake
dear
my
hope
speak
no
more
thus
but
consent
to
come
with
me
henceforth
since
i
know
thy
desire
i
will
enforce
myself
to
content
it
wherefore
sweet
my
treasure
change
counsel
and
come
away
with
me
who
have
never
known
weal
since
thou
wast
taken
from
me
whereto
answered
the
lady
have
no
mind
that
any
now
that
it
availeth
not
should
be
more
tender
of
my
honour
than
i
myself
would
my
kinsfolk
had
had
regard
thereto
whenas
they
gave
me
to
you
but
as
they
had
then
no
care
for
my
honour
i
am
under
no
present
concern
to
be
careful
of
theirs
and
if
i
am
herein
sin
i
shall
abide
though
it
be
in
pestle
sin
and
let
me
tell
you
that
here
meseemeth
i
am
paganino
wife
whereas
at
pisa
meseemed
i
was
your
whore
seeing
that
there
by
season
of
the
moon
and
quadratures
of
geometry
needs
must
be
planets
concur
to
couple
betwixt
you
and
me
whereas
here
paganino
holdeth
me
all
night
in
his
arms
and
straineth
me
and
biteth
me
and
how
he
serveth
me
let
god
tell
you
for
me
you
say
forsooth
you
will
enforce
yourself
to
what
to
do
it
in
three
casts
and
cause
it
stand
by
dint
of
cudgelling
i
warrant
me
you
are
grown
a
doughty
cavalier
since
i
saw
you
last
begone
and
enforce
yourself
to
live
for
methinketh
indeed
you
do
but
sojourn
here
below
upon
sufferance
so
peaked
and
scant
o
wind
you
show
to
me
and
yet
more
i
tell
you
that
should
he
leave
me
albeit
meseemeth
he
is
nowise
inclined
thereto
so
i
choose
to
stay
i
purpose
not
therefor
ever
to
return
to
you
of
whom
squeeze
you
as
i
might
there
were
no
making
a
porringer
of
sauce
for
that
i
abode
with
you
once
to
my
grievous
hurt
and
loss
wherefore
in
such
a
case
i
should
seek
my
vantage
elsewhere
nay
once
again
i
tell
you
here
be
neither
days
nor
vigils
wherefore
here
i
mean
to
abide
so
get
you
gone
in
god
name
as
quickliest
you
may
or
i
will
cry
out
that
you
would
fain
force
me
messer
ricciardo
seeing
himself
in
ill
case
and
now
recognizing
his
folly
in
taking
a
young
wife

he
was
himself
forspent
went
forth
the
chamber
tristful
and
woebegone
and
bespoke
paganino
with
many
words
that
skilled
not
a

leaving
the

he
returned
to

having
accomplished
aught

there
for

fell
into

as
he

greeted
him

gave
such

all
had

seeing
that
the
end
of

was

herself
somewhat

than

manner

of
those
who
have

make
manifest
to
you
in
few
words
my
opinion
which
an
it
be
approved
by
your
counsel
we
will
ensue
as
you
know
is
friday
and
the
next
day
is
saturday
days
which
by
reason
of
the
viands
that
are
used
therein
are
somewhat
irksome
to
most
folk
more
by
token
that
friday
considering
that
he
who
died
for
our
life
on
that
day
suffered
passion
is
worthy
of
reverence
wherefore
i
hold
it
a
just
thing
and
a
seemly
that
in
honour
of
the
divinity
we
apply
ourselves
rather
to
orisons
than
to
as
for
saturday
it
is
the
usance
of
ladies
on
that
day
to
wash
their
heads
and
do
away
all
dust
and
all
uncleanliness
befallen
them
for
the
labours
of
the
past
week
and
many
likewise
use
in
reverence
of
the
virgin
mother
of
the
son
of
god

fast
and
rest
from
all
manner
of
work
in
honour
of

ensuing
sunday

were
well
to
rest
from
on
that
day
also
after
which
for
that
we
shall
then
have
sojourned
here
four
days
i
hold
it
opportune
an
we
would
give
no
occasion
for
newcomers
to
intrude
upon
us
that
we
remove
hence
and
get
us
gone
elsewhither

i
have
already
considered
and
provided
there
when
we
shall
be
assembled
together
on
sunday
after
sleeping
we
having
had
leisure
enough
for
discoursing
at
large
i
have
bethought
myself
at
once
that
you
may
have
more
time
to
consider
and
because
it
will
be
yet
goodlier
that
the
license
of
our
be
somewhat
straitened
and
that
we
devise
of
one
of
the
many
fashions
of
fortune
that
our
discourse
shall
be
of
such
as
have
by
dint
of
diligence
acquired
some
much
desired
thing
or
recovered
some
lost

let
each
think
to

which
was
most

to

cellars
full
of
choicest
wines
and
the
very
cool
water
that
welled
there
in
great
abundance
they
praised
it
yet
more
thence
as
if
desirous
of
repose
they
betook
themselves
to
sit
in
a
gallery
which
commanded
all
the
courtyard
and
was
all
full
of
flowers
such
as
the
season
afforded
and
leafage
whereupon
there
came
the
careful
seneschal
and
entertained
and
refreshed
them
with
costliest
confections
and
wines
of
choice
thereafter
letting
open
to
them
a
garden
all
walled
about
which
coasted
the
palace
they
entered
therein
and
it
seeming
to
them
at
their
entering
altogether
they
addressed
themselves
more
intently
to
view
the
particulars
thereof
it
had
about
it
and
athwart
the
middle
very
spacious
alleys
all
straight
as
arrows
and
embowered
with
trellises
of
vines
which
made
great
show
of
bearing
abundance
of
grapes
that
year
and
being
then
all
in
blossom
yielded
so
rare
a
savour
about
the
garden
that
as
it
blent
with
the
fragrance
of
many
another
plant
that
there
gave
scent
themseemed
they
were
among
all
the
spiceries
that
ever
grew
in
the
orient
the
sides
of
these
alleys
were
all
in
a
manner
walled
about
with
roses
red
and
white
and
jessamine
wherefore
not
only
of
a
morning
but
what
while
the
sun
was
highest
one
might
go
all
about
untouched
thereby
neath
odoriferous
and
delightsome
shade
what
and
how
many
and
how
orderly
disposed
were
the
plants
that
grew
in
that
place
it
were
tedious
to
recount
suffice
it
that
there
is
none
goodly
of
those
which
may
brook
our
air
but
was
there
in
abundance
amiddleward
the
garden
what
was
not
less
but
yet
more
commendable
than
aught
else
there
was
a
plat
of
very
fine
grass
so
green
that
it
seemed
well
nigh
black
enamelled
all
with
belike
a
thousand
kinds
of
flowers
and
closed
about
with
the
greenest
and
lustiest
of
orange
and
citron
trees
the
which
bearing
at
once
old
fruits
and
new
and
flowers
not
only
afforded
the
eyes
a
pleasant
shade
but
were
no
less
grateful
to
the
smell
midmost
the
was
a
fountain
of
the
whitest
marble
enchased
with
sculptures
and
thence
whether
i
know
not
from
a
natural
or
an
artificial
source
there
sprang
by
a
figure
that
stood
on
a
column
in
its
midst
so
great
a
jet
of
water
and
so
high
towards
the
sky
whence
not
without
a
delectable
sound
it
fell
back
into
the
fount
that
a
mill
might
have
wrought
with
less
the
which
after
i
mean
the
water
which
overflowed
the
full
basin
issued
forth
of
the
lawn
by
a
hidden
way
and
coming
to
light
therewithout
encompassed
it
all
about
by
very
goodly
and
curiously
wroughten
channels
thence
by
like
channels
it
ran
through
well
nigh
every
part
of
the
pleasance
and
was
gathered
again
at
the
last
in
a
place
whereby
it
had
issue
from
the
fair
garden
and
whence
it
descended
in
the
clearest
of
streams
towards
the
plain
but
ere
it
won
thither
it
turned
two
mills
with
exceeding
power
and
to
the
no
small
vantage
of
the
lord
the
sight
of
this
garden
and
its
fair
ordinance
and
the
plants
and
the
fountain
with
the
rivulets
proceeding
therefrom
so
pleased
the
ladies
and
the
three
young
men
that
they
all
of
one
accord
avouched
that
an
paradise
might
be
created
upon
earth
they
could
not
avail
to
conceive
what
form
other
than
that
of
this
garden
might
be
given
it
nor
what
farther
beauty
might
possibly
be
added
thereunto
however
as
they
went
most
gladsomely
thereabout
weaving
them
the
goodliest
garlands
of
the
various
leafage
of
the
trees
and
hearkening
the
while
to
the
carols
of
belike
a
score
of
different
kinds
of
birds
that
sang
as
if
in
rivalry
one
of
other
they
became
aware
of
a
delectable
beauty
which
wonderstricken
as
they
were
with
the
other
charms
of
the
place
they
had
not
yet
noted
to
wit
they
found
the
garden
full
of
maybe
an
hundred
kinds
of
goodly
creatures
and
one
showing
them
to
other
they
saw
on
one
side
rabbits
issue
on
another
hares
run
here
lay
kids
and
there
fawns
went
grazing
and
there
was
many
another
kind
of
harmless
animal
each
going
about
his
pastime
at
his
pleasure
as
if
tame
the
which
added
unto
them
a
yet
greater
pleasure
than
the
others
after
they
had
gone
about
their
fill
viewing
now
this
thing
and
now
that
the
queen
let
set
the
tables
around
the
fair
fountain
and
at
her
commandment
having
first
sung
half
a
dozen
canzonets
and
danced
sundry
dances
they
sat
down
to
meat
there
being
right
well
and
orderly
served
after
a
very
fair
and
sumptuous
and
tranquil
fashion
with
goodly
and
delicate
viands
they
waxed
yet
blither
and
arising
thence
gave
themselves
anew
to
and
singing
and
dancing
till
it
seemed
good
to
the
queen
that
those
whom
it
pleased
should
betake
themselves
to
sleep
accordingly
some
went
thither
whilst
others
overcome
with
the
beauty
of
the
place
willed
not
to
leave
it
but
abiding
there
addressed
themselves
some
to
reading
romances
and
some
to
playing
chess
or
tables
whilst
the
others
slept
but
presently
the
hour
of
none
being
past
and
the
sleepers
having
arisen
and
refreshed
their
faces
with
cold
water
they
came
all
at
the
queen
commandment
to
the
lawn
hard
by
the
fountain
and
there
seating
themselves
after
the
wonted
fashion
waited
to
fall
to
upon
the
subject
proposed
by
her
the
first
upon
whom
she
laid
this
charge
was
filostrato
who
began
on
this
wise
footnote
half
not
half
tierce
or
the
equivalent
german
idiom
not
footnote
as
a
whole
the
first
story
day
the
third
masetto
of
lamporecchio
feigneth
himself
dumb
and
becometh
gardener
to
a
convent
of
women
who
all
flock
to
lie
with
him
fairest
ladies
there
be
many
men
and
women
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
whenas
the
white
fillet
is
bound
about
a
girl
head
and
the
black
cowl
clapped
upon
her
back
she
is
no
longer
a
woman
and
is
no
longer
sensible
of
feminine
appetites
as
if
the
making
her
a
nun
had
changed
her
to
stone
and
if
perchance
they
hear
aught
contrary
to
this
their
belief
they
are
as
much
incensed
as
if
a
very
great
and
heinous
misdeed
had
been
committed
against
nature
considering
not
neither
having
regard
to
themselves
whom
full
license
to
do
that
which
they
will
availeth
not
to
sate
nor
yet
to
the
much
potency
of
idlesse
and
on
like
wise
there
are
but
too
many
who
believe
that
spade
and
mattock
and
coarse
victuals
and
hard
living
do
altogether
purge
away
carnal
appetites
from
the
tillers
of
the
earth
and
render
them
exceeding
dull
of
wit
and
judgment
but
how
much
all
who
believe
thus
are
deluded
i
purpose
since
the
queen
hath
commanded
it
to
me
to
make
plain
to
you
in
a
little
story
without
departing
from
the
theme
by
her
appointed
footnote
the
commentators
will
have
it
that
this
is
an
error
for
solitude
but
i
see
no
necessity
for
the
substitution
the
text
being
perfectly
acceptable
as
it
stands
there
was
and
is
yet
in
these
our
parts
a
convent
of
women
very
famous
for
sanctity
the
which
that
i
may
not
anywise
abate
its
repute
i
will
not
name
wherein
no
great
while
agone
there
being
then
no
more
than
eight
nuns
and
an
abbess
all
young
in
the
nunnery
a
poor
silly
dolt
of
a
fellow
was
gardener
of
a
very
goodly
garden
of
theirs
who
being
miscontent
with
his
wage
settled
his
accounts
with
the
ladies
bailiff
and
returned
to
lamporecchio
whence
he
came
there
amongst
others
who
welcomed
him
home
was
a
young
labouring
man
stout
and
robust
and
for
a
countryman
a
fellow
by
name
of
masetto
who
asked
him
where
he
had
been
so
long
the
good
man
whose
name
was
nuto
told
him
whereupon
masetto
asked
him
in
what
he
had
served
the
convent
and
he
tended
a
great
and
goodly
garden
of
theirs
and
moreover
i
went
while
to
the
coppice
for
faggots
and
drew
water
and
did
other
such
small
matters
of
service
but
the
nuns
gave
me
so
little
wage
that
i
could
scare
find
me
in
shoon
withal
besides
they
are
all
young
and
methinketh
they
are
possessed
of
the
devil
for
there
was
no
doing
anything
to
their
liking
nay
when
i
was
at
work
whiles
in
the
hortyard
quoth
one
set
this
here
and
another
set
that
here
and
a
third
snatched
the
spade
from
my
hand
saying
that
is
naught
brief
they
gave
me
so
much
vexation
that
i
would
leave
work
be
and
begone
out
of
the
hortyard
insomuch
that
what
with
one
thing
and
what
with
another
i
would
abide
there
no
longer
and
took
myself
off
when
i
came
away
their
bailiff
besought
me
an
i
could
lay
my
hand
on
any
one
apt
unto
that
service
to
send
the
man
to
him
and
i
promised
it
him
but
may
god
make
him
sound
of
the
loins
as
he
whom
i
shall
get
him
else
will
i
send
him
none
at
all
masetto
hearing
this
was
taken
with
so
great
a
desire
to
be
with
these
nuns
that
he
was
all
consumed
therewith
judging
from
nuto
words
that
he
might
avail
to
compass
somewhat
of
that
which
he
desired
however
foreseeing
that
he
would
fail
of
his
purpose
if
he
discovered
aught
thereof
to
nuto
he
said
to
the
latter
thou
didst
well
to
come
away
how
is
a
man
to
live
with
women
he
were
better
abide
with
devils
six
times
out
of
seven
they
know
not
what
they
would
have
themselves
but
after
they
had
made
an
end
of
their
talk
masetto
began
to
cast
about
what
means
he
should
take
to
be
with
them
and
feeling
himself
well
able
to
do
the
offices
of
which
nuto
had
spoken
he
had
no
fear
of
being
refused
on
that
head
but
misdoubted
him
he
might
not
be
received
for
that
he
was
young
and
wherefore
after
pondering
many
things
in
himself
he
bethought
himself
thus
place
is
far
hence
and
none
knoweth
me
there
an
i
can
but
make
a
show
of
being
dumb
i
shall
for
certain
be
received
there
having
fixed
upon
this
device
he
set
out
with
an
axe
he
had
about
his
neck
without
telling
any
whither
he
was
bound
and
betook
himself
in
the
guise
of
a
beggarman
to
the
convent
where
being
come
he
entered
in
and
as
luck
would
have
it
found
the
bailiff
in
the
courtyard
him
he
accosted
with
signs
such
as
dumb
folk
use
and
made
a
show
of
asking
food
of
him
for
the
love
of
god
and
that
in
return
he
would
an
it
were
needed
cleave
wood
for
him
the
bailiff
willingly
gave
him
to
eat
and
after
set
before
him
divers
logs
that
nuto
had
not
availed
to
cleave
but
of
all
which
masetto
who
was
very
strong
made
a
speedy
despatch
by
and
by
the
bailiff
having
occasion
to
go
to
the
coppice
carried
him
thither
and
put
him
to
cutting
faggots
after
which
setting
the
ass
before
him
he
gave
him
to
understand
by
signs
that
he
was
to
bring
them
home
this
he
did
very
well
wherefore
the
bailiff
kept
him
there
some
days
so
he
might
have
him
do
certain
things
for
which
he
had
occasion
one
day
it
chanced
that
the
abbess
saw
him
and
asked
the
bailiff
who
he
was
answered
he
is
a
poor
deaf
and
dumb
man
who
came
hither
the
other
day
to
ask
an
alms
so
i
took
him
in
out
of
charity
and
have
made
him
do
sundry
things
of
which
we
had
need
if
he
knew
how
to
till
the
hortyard
and
chose
to
abide
with
us
i
believe
we
should
get
good
service
of
him
for
that
we
lack
such
an
one
and
he
is
strong
and
we
could
make
what
we
would
of
him
more
by
token
that
you
would
have
no
occasion
to
fear
his
playing
the
fool
with
yonder
lasses
of
yours
faith
rejoined
the
abbess
sayst
sooth
learn
if
he
knoweth
how
to
till
and
study
to
keep
him
here
give
him
a
pair
of
shoes
and
some
old
hood
or
other
and
make
much
of
him
caress
him
give
him
plenty
to
eat
which
the
bailiff
promised
to
do
masetto
was
not
so
far
distant
but
he
heard
all
this
making
a
show
the
while
of
sweeping
the
courtyard
and
said
merrily
in
himself
you
put
me
therein
i
will
till
you
your
hortyard
as
it
was
never
tilled
yet
accordingly
the
bailiff
seeing
that
he
knew
right
well
how
to
work
asked
him
by
signs
if
he
had
a
mind
to
abide
there
and
he
replied
on
like
wise
that
he
would
do
whatsoever
he
wished
whereupon
the
bailiff
engaged
him
and
charged
him
till
the
hortyard
showing
him
what
he
was
to
do
after
which
he
went
about
other
business
of
the
convent
and
left
him
presently
as
masetto
went
working
one
day
after
another
the
nuns
fell
to
plaguing
him
and
making
mock
of
him
as
ofttimes
it
betideth
that
folk
do
with
mutes
and
bespoke
him
the
naughtiest
words
in
the
world
thinking
he
understood
them
not
whereof
the
abbess
mayhap
supposing
him
to
be
tailless
as
well
as
tongueless
recked
little
or
nothing
it
chanced
one
day
however
that
as
he
rested
himself
after
a
hard
morning
work
two
young
nuns
who
went
about
the
garden
drew
near
the
place
where
he
lay
and
fell
to
looking
upon
him
whilst
he
made
a
show
of
sleeping
presently
quoth
one
who
was
somewhat
the
bolder
of
the
twain
to
the
other
i
thought
thou
wouldst
keep
my
counsel
i
would
tell
thee
a
thought
which
i
have
once
and
again
had
and
which
might
perchance
profit
thee
also
in
all
assurance
answered
the
other
certes
i
will
never
tell
it
to
any
then
said
the
forward
wench
know
not
if
thou
have
ever
considered
how
straitly
we
are
kept
and
how
no
man
dare
ever
enter
here
save
the
bailiff
who
is
old
and
yonder
dumb
fellow
and
i
have
again
and
again
heard
ladies
who
come
to
visit
us
say
that
all
other
delights
in
the
world
are
but
toys
in
comparison
with
that
which
a
woman
enjoyeth
whenas
she
hath
to
do
with
a
man
wherefore
i
have
often
had
it
in
mind
to
make
trial
with
this
mute
since
with
others
i
may
not
if
it
be
so
and
indeed
he
is
the
best
in
the
world
to
that
end
for
that
if
he
would
he
could
not
nor
might
tell
it
again
thou
seest
he
is
a
poor
silly
lout
of
a
lad
who
hath
overgrown
his
wit
and
i
would
fain
hear
how
thou
deemest
of
the
thing
rejoined
the
other
is
this
thou
sayest
knowest
thou
not
that
we
have
promised
our
virginity
to
god
as
for
that
answered
the
first
many
things
are
promised
him
all
day
long
whereof
not
one
is
fulfilled
unto
him
an
we
have
promised
it
him
let
him
find
himself
another
or
others
to
perform
it
to
him
if
went
on
her
fellow
should
prove
with
child
how
would
it
go
then
quoth
the
other
beginnest
to
take
thought
unto
ill
ere
it
cometh
when
that
betideth
then
will
we
look
to
it
there
will
be
a
thousand
ways
for
us
of
doing
so
that
it
shall
never
be
known
provided
we
ourselves
tell
it
not
the
other
hearing
this
and
having
now
a
greater
itch
than
her
companion
to
prove
what
manner
beast
a
man
was
said
then
how
shall
we
do
quoth
the
first
seest
it
is
nigh
upon
none
and
methinketh
the
sisters
are
all
asleep
save
only
ourselves
let
us
look
about
the
hortyard
if
there
be
any
there
and
if
there
be
none
what
have
we
to
do
but
to
take
him
by
the
hand
and
carry
him
into
yonder
hut
whereas
he
harboureth
against
the
rain
and
there
let
one
of
us
abide
with
him
whilst
the
other
keepeth
watch
he
is
so
simple
that
he
will
do
whatever
we
will
masetto
heard
all
this
talk
and
disposed
to
compliance
waited
but
to
be
taken
by
one
of
the
nuns
the
latter
having
looked
well
all
about
and
satisfied
themselves
that
they
could
be
seen
from
nowhere
she
who
had
broached
the
matter
came
up
to
masetto
and
aroused
him
whereupon
he
rose
incontinent
to
his
feet
the
nun
took
him
coaxingly
by
the
hand
and
led
him
grinning
like
an
idiot
to
the
hut
where
without
overmuch
pressing
he
did
what
she
would
then
like
a
loyal
comrade
having
had
her
will
she
gave
place
to
her
fellow
and
masetto
still
feigning
himself
a
simpleton
did
their
pleasure
before
they
departed
thence
each
of
the
girls
must
needs
once
more
prove
how
the
mute
could
horse
it
and
after
devising
with
each
other
they
agreed
that
the
thing
was
as
delectable
as
they
had
heard
nay
more
so
accordingly
watching
their
opportunity
they
went
oftentimes
at
fitting
seasons
to
divert
themselves
with
the
mute
till
one
day
it
chanced
that
one
of
their
sisters
espying
them
in
the
act
from
the
lattice
of
her
cell
showed
it
to
other
twain
at
first
they
talked
of
denouncing
the
culprits
to
the
abbess
but
after
changing
counsel
and
coming
to
an
accord
with
the
first
two
they
became
sharers
with
them
in
masetto
services
and
to
them
the
other
three
nuns
were
at
divers
times
and
by
divers
chances
added
as
associates
ultimately
the
abbess
who
had
not
yet
gotten
wind
of
these
doings
walking
one
day
alone
in
the
garden
the
heat
being
great
found
masetto
who
had
enough
of
a
little
fatigue
by
day
because
of
overmuch
posting
it
by
night
stretched
out
asleep
under
the
shade
of
an
and
the
wind
lifting
the
forepart
of
his
clothes
all
abode
discovered
the
lady
beholding
this
and
seeing
herself
alone
fell
into
that
same
appetite
which
had
gotten
hold
of
her
nuns
and
arousing
masetto
carried
him
to
her
chamber
where
to
the
no
small
miscontent
of
the
others
who
complained
loudly
that
the
gardener
came
not
to
till
the
hortyard
she
kept
him
several
days
proving
and
reproving
that
delight
which
she
had
erst
been
wont
to
blame
in
others
at
last
she
sent
him
back
to
his
own
lodging
but
was
fain
to
have
him
often
again
and
as
moreover
she
required
of
him
more
than
her
share
masetto
unable
to
satisfy
so
many
bethought
himself
that
his
playing
the
mute
might
an
it
endured
longer
result
in
his
exceeding
great
hurt
wherefore
being
one
night
with
the
abbess
he
gave
loose
to
his
tongue
and
bespoke
her
thus
i
have
heard
say
that
one
cock
sufficeth
unto
half
a
score
hens
but
that
half
a
score
men
can
ill
or
hardly
satisfy
one
woman
whereas
needs
must
i
serve
nine
and
to
this
i
can
no
wise
endure
nay
for
that
which
i
have
done
up
to
now
i
am
come
to
such
a
pass
that
i
can
do
neither
little
nor
much
wherefore
do
ye
either
let
me
go
in
god
name
or
find
a
remedy
for
the
matter
the
abbess
hearing
him
speak
whom
she
held
dumb
was
all
amazed
and
said
is
this
methought
thou
wast
dumb
answered
masetto
was
indeed
dumb
not
by
nature
but
by
reason
of
a
malady
which
bereft
me
of
speech
and
only
this
very
night
for
the
first
time
do
i
feel
it
restored
to
me
wherefore
i
praise
god
as
most
i
may
the
lady
believed
this
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
saying
that
he
had
to
serve
nine
masetto
told
her
how
the
case
stood
whereby
she
perceived
that
she
had
no
nun
but
was
far
wiser
than
herself
but
like
a
discreet
woman
as
she
was
she
resolved
to
take
counsel
with
her
nuns
to
find
some
means
of
arranging
the
matter
without
letting
masetto
go
so
the
convent
might
not
be
defamed
by
him
accordingly
having
openly
confessed
to
one
another
that
which
had
been
secretly
done
of
each
they
all
of
one
accord
with
masetto
consent
so
ordered
it
that
the
people
round
about
believed
speech
to
have
been
restored
to
him
after
he
had
long
been
mute
through
their
prayers
and
by
the
merits
of
the
saint
in
whose
name
the
convent
was
intituled
and
their
bailiff
being
lately
dead
they
made
masetto
bailiff
in
his
stead
and
apportioned
his
toils
on
such
wise
that
he
could
endure
them
thereafter
albeit
he
began
upon
them
monikins
galore
the
thing
was
so
discreetly
ordered
that
nothing
took
vent
thereof
till
after
the
death
of
the
abbess
when
masetto
began
to
grow
old
and
had
a
mind
to
return
home
rich
the
thing
becoming
known
enabled
him
lightly
to
accomplish
his
desire
and
thus
masetto
having
by
his
foresight
contrived
to
employ
his
youth
to
good
purpose
returned
in
his
old
age
rich
and
a
father
without
being
at
the
pains
or
expense
of
rearing
children
to
the
place
whence
he
had
set
out
with
an
axe
about
his
neck
avouching
that
thus
did
christ
entreat
whoso
set
horns
to
his
cap

of

agilulf
been

it
befell
that
one
of
the
said
queen
a
man
of
very
low
condition
in
respect
of
birth
but
otherwise
of
worth
far
above
so
mean
a
station
and
comely
of
person
and
tall
as
he
were
the
king
became
beyond
measure
enamoured
of
his
mistress
his
mean
estate
hindered
him
not
from
being
sensible
that
this
love
of
his
was
out
of
all
reason
wherefore
like
a
discreet
man
as
he
was
he
discovered
it
unto
none
nor
dared
he
make
it
known
to
her
even
with
his
eyes
but
albeit
he
lived
without
any
hope
of
ever
winning
her
favour
yet
inwardly
he
gloried
in
that
he
had
bestowed
his
thoughts
in
such
high
place
and
being
all
aflame
with
amorous
fire
he
studied
beyond
every
other
of
his
fellows
to
do
whatsoever
he
deemed
might
pleasure
the
queen
whereby
it
befell
that
whenas
she
had
occasion
to
ride
abroad
she
liefer
mounted
the
palfrey
of
which
he
had
charge
than
any
other
and
when
this
happened
he
reckoned
it
a
passing
great
favour
to
himself
nor
ever
stirred
from
her
stirrup
accounting
himself
happy
what
time
he
might
but
touch
her
clothes
but
as
often
enough
we
see
it
happen
that
even
as
hope
groweth
less
so
love
waxeth
greater
so
did
it
betide
this
poor
groom
insomuch
that
sore
uneath
it
was
to
him
to
avail
to
brook
his
great
desire
keeping
it
as
he
did
hidden
and
being
upheld
by
no
hope
and
many
a
time
unable
to
rid
himself
of
that
his
love
he
determined
in
himself
to
die
and
considering
inwardly
of
the
manner
he
resolved
to
seek
his
death
on
such
wise
that
it
should
be
manifest
he
died
for
the
love
he
bore
the
queen
to
which
end
he
bethought
himself
to
try
his
fortune
in
an
enterprise
of
such
a
sort
as
should
afford
him
a
chance
of
having
or
all
or
part
of
his
desire
he
set
not
himself
to
seek
to
say
aught
to
the
queen
nor
to
make
her
sensible
of
his
love
by
letters
knowing
he
should
speak
and
write
in
vain
but
chose
rather
to
essay
an
he
might
by
practice
avail
to
lie
with
her
nor
was
there
any
other
shift
for
it
but
to
find
a
means
how
he
might
in
the
person
of
the
king
who
he
knew
lay
not
with
her
continually
contrive
to
make
his
way
to
her
and
enter
her
bedchamber
accordingly
that
he
might
see
on
what
wise
and
in
what
habit
the
king
went
whenas
he
visited
her
he
hid
himself
several
times
by
night
in
a
great
saloon
of
the
palace
which
lay
between
the
king
bedchamber
and
that
of
the
queen
and
one
night
amongst
others
he
saw
the
king
come
forth
of
his
chamber
wrapped
in
a
great
mantle
with
a
lighted
taper
in
one
hand
and
a
little
wand
in
the
other
and
making
for
the
queen
chamber
strike
once
or
twice
upon
the
door
with
the
wand
without
saying
aught
whereupon
it
was
incontinent
opened
to
him
and
the
taper
taken
from
his
hand
noting
this
and
having
seen
the
king
return
after
the
same
fashion
he
bethought
himself
to
do
likewise
accordingly
finding
means
to
have
a
cloak
like
that
which
he
had
seen
the
king
wear
together
with
a
taper
and
a
wand
and
having
first
well
washed
himself
in
a
bagnio
lest
haply
the
smell
of
the
muck
should
offend
the
queen
or
cause
her
smoke
the
cheat
he
hid
himself
in
the
great
saloon
as
of
wont
whenas
he
knew
that
all
were
asleep
and
it
seemed
to
him
time
either
to
give
effect
to
his
desire
or
to
make
his
way
by
high
emprise
to
the
death
he
struck
a
light
with
a
flint
and
steel
he
had
brought
with
him
and
kindling
the
taper
wrapped
himself
fast
in
the
mantle
then
going
up
to
the
smote
twice
upon
it
with
the
wand
the
door
was
opened
by
a
all
who
took
the
light
and
covered
it
whereupon
without
saying
aught
he
passed
within
the
curtain
put
off
his
mantle
and
entered
the
bed
where
the
queen
slept
then
taking
her
desirefully
in
his
arms
and
feigning
himself
troubled
for
that
he
knew
the
king
wont
to
be
that
whenas
he
was
troubled
he
cared
not
to
hear
aught
without
speaking
or
being
spoken
to
he
several
times
carnally
knew
the
queen
after
which
grievous
as
it
seemed
to
him
to
depart
yet
fearing
lest
his
too
long
stay
should
be
the
occasion
of
turning
the
gotten
delight
into
dolour
he
arose
and
taking
up
the
mantle
and
the
light
withdrew
without
word
said
and
returned
as
quickliest
he
might
to
his
own
bed
he
could
scarce
yet
have
been
therein
when
the
king
arose
and
repaired
to
the
queen
chamber
whereat
she
marvelled
exceedingly
and
as
he
entered
the
bed
and
greeted
her
blithely
she
took
courage
by
his
cheerfulness
and
said
my
lord
what
new
fashion
is
this
of
you
left
me
but
now
after
having
taken
pleasure
of
me
beyond
your
wont
and
do
you
return
so
soon
have
a
care
what
you
do
the
king
hearing
these
words
at
once
concluded
that
the
queen
had
been
deceived
by
likeness
of
manners
and
person
but
like
a
wise
man
bethought
himself
forthright
seeing
that
neither
she
nor
any
else
had
perceived
the
cheat
not
to
make
her
aware
thereof
which
many
simpletons
would
not
have
done
but
would
have
said
have
not
been
here
i
who
is
it
hath
been
here
how
did
it
happen
who
came
hither
whence
many
things
might
have
arisen
whereby
he
would
needlessly
have
afflicted
the
lady
and
given
her
ground
for
desiring
another
time
that
which
she
had
already
tasted
more
by
token
that
an
he
kept
silence
of
the
matter
no
shame
might
revert
to
him
whereas
by
speaking
he
would
have
brought
dishonour
upon
himself
the
king
then
more
troubled
at
heart
than
in
looks
or
speech
answered
saying
seem
i
not
to
you
man
enough
to
have
been
here
a
first
time
and
to
come
yet
again
after
that
my
lord
answered
she
i
beseech
you
have
regard
to
your
health
quoth
agilulf
it
pleaseth
me
to
follow
your
counsel
wherefore
for
the
nonce
i
will
get
me
gone
again
without
giving
you
more
annoy
this
said
taking
up
his
mantle
he
departed
the
chamber
with
a
heart
full
of
wrath
and
despite
for
the
affront
that
he
saw
had
been
done
him
and
bethought
himself
quietly
to
seek
to
discover
the
culprit
concluding
that
he
must
be
of
the
household
and
could
not
whoever
he
might
be
have
issued
forth
of
the
palace
accordingly
taking
a
very
small
light
in
a
little
lantern
he
betook
himself
to
a
very
long
gallery
that
was
over
the
stables
of
his
palace
and
where
all
his
household
slept
in
different
beds
and
judging
that
whoever
he
might
be
that
had
done
what
the
queen
said
his
pulse
and
the
beating
of
his
heart
for
the
swink
endured
could
not
yet
have
had
time
to
abate
he
silently
beginning
at
one
end
of
the
gallery
fell
to
feeling
each
one
breast
to
know
if
his
heart
beat
high
although
every
other
slept
fast
he
who
had
been
with
the
queen
was
not
yet
asleep
but
seeing
the
king
come
and
guessing
what
he
went
seeking
fell
into
such
a
fright
that
to
the
beating
of
the
heart
caused
by
the
fatigue
fear
added
yet
a
greater
and
he
doubted
not
but
the
king
if
he
became
aware
of
this
would
put
him
to
death
without
delay
and
many
things
passed
through
his
thought
that
he
should
do
however
seeing
him
all
unarmed
he
resolved
to
feign
sleep
and
await
what
he
should
do
agilulf
then
having
examined
many
and
found
none
whom
he
judged
to
be
he
of
whom
he
was
in
quest
came
presently
to
the
horsekeeper
and
feeling
his
heart
beat
high
said
in
himself
is
the
man
nevertheless
an
he
would
have
nought
be
known
of
that
which
he
purposed
to
do
he
did
nought
to
him
but
poll
with
a
pair
of
scissors
he
had
brought
with
him
somewhat
on
one
side
of
his
hair
which
they
then
wore
very
long
so
by
that
token
he
might
know
him
again
on
the
morrow
and
this
done
he
withdrew
and
returned
to
his
own
chamber
the
culprit
who
had
felt
all
this
like
a
shrewd
fellow
as
he
was
understood
plainly
enough
why
he
had
been
thus
marked
wherefore
he
arose
without
delay
and
finding
a
pair
of
shears
whereof
it
chanced
there
were
several
about
the
stables
for
the
service
of
the
horses
went
softly
up
to
all
who
lay
in
the
gallery
and
clipped
each
one
hair
on
like
wise
over
the
ear
which
having
done
without
being
observed
he
returned
to
sleep
when
the
king
arose
in
the
morning
he
commanded
that
all
his
household
should
present
themselves
before
him
or
ever
the
were
opened
and
it
was
done
as
he
said
then
as
they
all
stood
before
him
with
uncovered
heads
he
began
to
look
that
he
might
know
him
whom
he
had
polled
but
seeing
the
most
part
of
them
with
their
hair
clipped
after
one
and
the
same
fashion
he
marvelled
and
said
in
himself
whom
i
seek
for
all
he
may
be
of
mean
estate
showeth
right
well
he
is
of
no
mean
wit
then
seeing
that
he
could
not
without
making
a
stir
avail
to
have
him
whom
he
sought
and
having
no
mind
to
incur
a
great
shame
for
the
sake
of
a
paltry
revenge
it
pleased
him
with
one
sole
word
to
admonish
the
culprit
and
show
him
that
he
was
ware
of
the
matter
wherefore
turning
to
all
who
were
present
he
said
him
who
did
it
do
it
no
more
and
get
you
gone
in
peace
another
would
have
been
for
giving
them
the
strappado
for
torturing
examining
and
questioning
and
doing
this
would
have
published
that
which
every
one
should
go
about
to
conceal
and
having
thus
discovered
himself
though
he
should
have
taken
entire
revenge
for
the
affront
suffered
his
shame
had
not
been
minished
nay
were
rather
much
enhanced
therefor
and
his
honour
sullied
those
who
heard
the
king
words
marvelled
and
long
debated
amongst
themselves
what
he
meant
by
this
speech
but
none
understood
it
save
he
whom
it
concerned
and
he
like
a
wise
man
never
during
agilulf
lifetime
discovered
the
matter
nor
ever
again
committed
his
life
to
the
hazard
of
such
a
venture

like

this
story
charming
ladies
i
shall
tell
you
not
only
for
the
ensuing
of
the
order
imposed
but
to
give
you
to
know
withal
that
even
the
clergy
to
whom
we
women
beyond
measure
credulous
as
we
are
yield
overmuch
faith
can
be
and
are
whiles
adroitly
befooled
and
that
not
by
men
only
but
even
by
certain
of
our
own
sex
in
our
city
the
which
is
fuller
of
cozenage
than
of
love
or
faith
there
was
not
many
years
agone
a
gentlewoman
adorned
with
beauty
and
charms
and
as
richly
endowed
by
nature
as
any
of
her
sex
with
engaging
manners
and
loftiness
of
spirit
and
subtle
wit
whose
name
albeit
i
know
i
purpose
not
to
discover
it
no
nor
any
other
that
pertaineth
unto
the
present
story

that
there
be
folk
yet
alive
who
would
take
it
in
despite
whereas
it
should
be
passed
over
with
a
laugh
this
lady
then
seeing
herself
though
of
high
lineage
married
to
a
and
unable
for
that
he
was
a
craftsman
to
put
off
the
haughtiness
of
her
spirit
whereby
she
deemed
no
man
of
mean
condition
how
rich
soever
he
might
be
worthy
of
a
gentlewoman
and
seeing
him
moreover
for
all
his
wealth
to
be
apt
unto
nothing
of
more
moment
than
to
lay
a
warp
for
a
piece
of
motley
or
let
weave
a
cloth
or
chaffer
with
a
spinster
anent
her
yarn
resolved
on
no
wise
to
admit
of
his
embraces
save
in
so
far
as
she
might
not
deny
him
but
to
seek
for
her
own
satisfaction
to
find
some
one
who
should
be
worthier
of
her
favours
than
the
appeared
to
her
to
be
and
accordingly
fell
so
fervently
in
love
with
a
man
of
very
good
quality
and
middle
age
that
whenas
she
saw
him
not
by
day
she
could
not
pass
the
ensuing
night
without
unease
the
gentleman
perceiving
not
how
the
case
stood
took
no
heed
of
her
and
she
being
very
circumspect
dared
not
make
the
matter
known
to
him
by
sending
of
women
nor
by
letter
fearing
the
possible
perils
that
might
betide
however
observing
that
he
companied
much
with
a
churchman
who
albeit
a
dull
lump
of
a
fellow
was
nevertheless
for
that
he
was
a
man
of
very
devout
life
reputed
of
well
nigh
all
a
most
worthy
friar
she
bethought
herself
that
this
latter
would
make
an
excellent
herself
and
her
lover
and
having
considered
what
means
she
should
use
she
repaired
at
a
fitting
season
to
the
church
where
he
abode
and
letting
call
him
to
her
told
him
that
an
he
pleased
she
would
fain
confess
herself
to
him
the
friar
seeing
her
and
judging
her
to
be
a
woman
of
condition
willingly
gave
ear
to
her
and
she
after
confession
said
to
him
mine
it
behoveth
me
have
recourse
to
you
for
aid
and
counsel
anent
that
which
you
shall
hear
i
know
as
having
myself
told
you
that
you
know
my
kinsfolk
and
my
husband
who
loveth
me
more
than
his
life
nor
is
there
aught
i
desire
but
i
have
it
of
him
incontinent
he
being
a
very
rich
man
and
one
who
can
well
afford
it
wherefore
i
love
him
more
than
mine
own
self
and
should
i
but
think
let
alone
do
aught
that
might
be
contrary
to
his
honour
and
pleasure
there
were
no
woman
more
wicked
or
more
deserving
of
the
fire
than
i
now
one
whose
name
in
truth
i
know
not
but
who
is
meseemeth
a
man
of
condition
and
is
if
i
mistake
not
much
in
your
company
a
man
and
tall
of
his
person
and
clad
in
very
decent
raiment
unaware
belike
of
the
constancy
of
my
purpose
appeareth
to
have
laid
siege
to
me
nor
can
i
show
myself
at
door
or
window
nor
go
without
the
house
but
he
incontinent
presenteth
himself
before
me
and
i
marvel
that
he
is
not
here
now
whereat
i
am
sore
concerned
for
that
such
fashions
as
these
often
bring
virtuous
women
into
reproach
without
their
fault
i
have
whiles
had
it
in
mind
to
have
him
told
of
this
by
my
brothers
but
then
i
have
bethought
me
that
men
oftentimes
do
messages
on
such
wise
that
ill
answers
ensue
which
give
rise
to
words
and
from
words
they
come
to
deeds
wherefore
lest
mischief
spring
therefrom
and
scandal
i
have
kept
silence
of
the
matter
and
have
determined
to
discover
it
to
yourself
rather
than
to
another
at
once
because
meseemeth
you
are
his
friend
and
for
that
it
beseemeth
you
to
rebuke
not
only
friends
but
strangers
of
such
things
i
beseech
you
therefore
for
the
one
sake
that
you
rebuke
him
of
this
and
pray
him
leave
these
his
fashions
there
be
women
enough
who
incline
belike
to
these
toys
and
would
take
pleasure
in
being
dogged
and
courted
by
him
whereas
to
me
who
have
no
manner
of
mind
to
such
matters
it
is
a
very
grievous
annoy
so
saying
she
bowed
her
head
as
she
would
weep
the
holy
friar
understood
incontinent
of
whom
she
spoke
and
firmly
believing
what
she
said
to
be
true
greatly
commended
her
righteous
intent
and
promised
her
to
do
on
such
wise
that
she
should
have
no
farther
annoy
from
the
person
in
question
and
knowing
her
to
be
very
rich
he
commended
to
her
works
of
charity
and
almsdeeds
recounting
to
her
his
own
need
quoth
the
lady
beseech
you
thereof
for
god
sake
and
should
he
deny
prithee
scruple
not
to
tell
him
that
it
was
i
who
told
you
this
and
complained
to
you
thereof
then
having
made
her
confession
and
gotten
her
penance
recalling
the
friar
exhortations
to
works
of
almsgiving
she
stealthily
filled
his
hand
with
money
praying
him
to
say
masses
for
the
souls
of
her
dead
kinsfolk
after
which
she
rose
from
his
feet
and
taking
leave
of
him
returned
home
not
long
after
up
came
the
gentleman
according
to
his
wont
and
after
they
had
talked
awhile
of
one
thing
and
another
the
friar
drawing
his
friend
aside
very
civilly
rebuked
him
of
the
manner
in
which
as
he
believed
he
pursued
and
spied
upon
the
lady
aforesaid
according
to
that
which
she
had
given
him
to
understand
the
other
marvelled
as
well
he
might
having
never
set
eyes
upon
her
and
being
used
very
rarely
to
pass
before
her
house
and
would
have
excused
himself
but
the
friar
suffered
him
not
to
speak
saying
make
no
show
of
wonderment
nor
waste
words
in
denying
it
for
it
will
avail
thee
nothing
i
learnt
not
these
matters
from
the
neighbours
nay
she
herself
told
them
to
me
complaining
sore
of
thee
and
besides
that
such
toys
beseem
not
a
man
of
thine
age
i
may
tell
thee
this
much
of
her
that
if
ever
i
saw
a
woman
averse
to
these
follies
it
is
she
wherefore
for
thine
own
credit
and
her
comfort
i
prithee
desist
therefrom
and
let
her
be
in
peace
the
gentleman
quicker
of
wit
than
the
friar
was
not
slow
to
apprehend
the
lady
device
and
feigning
to
be
somewhat
abashed
promised
to
meddle
no
more
with
her
thenceforward
then
taking
leave
of
the
friar
he
betook
himself
to
the
house
of
the
lady
who
still
abode
await
at
a
little
window
so
she
might
see
him
should
he
pass
that
way
when
she
saw
him
come
she
showed
herself
so
rejoiced
and
so
gracious
to
him
that
he
might
very
well
understand
that
he
had
gathered
the
truth
from
the
friar
words
and
thenceforward
under
colour
of
other
business
he
began
with
the
utmost
precaution
to
pass
continually
through
the
street
to
his
own
pleasure
and
to
the
exceeding
delight
and
solace
of
the
lady
after
awhile
perceiving
that
she
pleased
him
even
as
he
pleased
her
and
wishful
to
inflame
him
yet
more
and
to
certify
him
of
the
love
she
bore
him
she
betook
herself
again
choosing
her
time
and
place
to
the
holy
friar
and
seating
herself
at
his
feet
in
the
church
fell
the
friar
seeing
this
asked
her
affectionately
what
was
to
do
with
her
anew
father
mine
answered
she
which
aileth
me
is
none
other
than
yonder
friend
of
yours
of
whom
i
complained
to
you
the
other
day
for
that
methinketh
he
was
born
for
my
especial
torment
and
to
make
me
do
a
thing
such
that
i
should
never
be
glad
again
nor
ever
after
dare
to
seat
myself
at
your
feet
cried
the
friar
he
not
given
over
annoying
thee
indeed
answered
she
since
i
complained
to
you
of
him
as
if
of
despite
maybe
taking
it
ill
that
i
should
have
done
so
for
every
once
he
used
to
pass
before
my
house
i
verily
believe
he
hath
passed
seven
times
and
would
to
god
he
were
content
with
passing
and
spying
upon
me
nay
he
is
grown
so
bold
and
so
malapert
that
but
yesterday
he
despatched
a
woman
to
me
at
home
with
his
idle
tales
and
toys
and
sent
me
a
purse
and
a
girdle
as
if
i
had
not
purses
and
girdles
galore
the
which
i
took
and
take
so
ill
that
i
believe
but
for
my
having
regard
to
the
sin
of
it
and
after
for
the
love
of
you
i
had
played
the
devil
however
i
contained
myself
and
would
not
do
or
say
aught
whereof
i
should
not
first
have
let
you
know
nay
i
had
already
returned
the
purse
and
the
girdle
to
the
baggage
who
brought
them
that
she
might
carry
them
back
to
him
and
had
given
her
a
rough
dismissal
but
after
fearing
she
might
keep
them
for
herself
and
tell
him
that
i
had
accepted
them
as
i
hear
women
of
her
fashion
do
whiles
i
called
her
back
and
took
them
full
of
despite
from
her
hands
and
have
brought
them
to
you
so
you
may
return
them
to
him
and
tell
him
i
want
none
of
his
trash
for
that
thanks
to
god
and
my
husband
i
have
purses
and
girdles
enough
to
smother
him
withal
moreover
if
hereafter
he
desist
not
from
this
i
tell
you
as
a
father
you
must
excuse
me
but
i
will
tell
it
come
what
may
to
my
husband
and
my
brothers
for
i
had
far
liefer
he
should
brook
an
affront
if
needs
he
must
than
that
i
should
suffer
blame
for
him
wherefore
let
him
look
to
himself
so
saying
still
weeping
sore
she
pulled
out
from
under
her
surcoat
a
very
handsome
and
rich
purse
and
a
quaint
and
costly
girdle
and
threw
them
into
the
lap
of
the
friar
who
fully
crediting
that
which
she
told
him
and
incensed
beyond
measure
took
them
and
said
to
her
i
marvel
not
that
thou
art
provoked
at
these
doings
nor
can
i
blame
thee
therefor
but
i
much
commend
thee
for
following
my
counsel
in
the
matter
i
rebuked
him
the
other
day
and
he
hath
ill
performed
that
which
he
promised
me
wherefore
as
well
for
that
as
for
this
that
he
hath
newly
done
i
mean
to
warm
his
ears
for
him
after
such
a
fashion
that
methinketh
he
will
give
thee
no
farther
concern
but
do
thou
benison
on
thee
suffer
not
thyself
to
be
so
overcome
with
anger
that
thou
tell
it
to
any
of
thy
folk
for
that
overmuch
harm
might
ensue
thereof
unto
him
neither
fear
thou
lest
this
blame
anywise
ensue
to
thee
for
i
shall
still
before
both
god
and
men
be
a
most
constant
witness
to
thy
virtue
the
lady
made
believe
to
be
somewhat
comforted
and
leaving
that
talk
said
as
one
who
knew
his
greed
and
that
of
his
these
some
nights
past
there
have
appeared
to
me
sundry
of
my
kinsfolk
who
ask
nought
but
almsdeeds
and
meseemeth
they
are
indeed
in
exceeding
great
torment
especially
my
mother
who
appeareth
to
me
in
such
ill
case
and
affliction
that
it
is
pity
to
behold
methinketh
she
suffereth
exceeding
distress
to
see
me
in
this
tribulation
with
yonder
enemy
of
god
wherefore
i
would
have
you
say
me
forty
masses
of
saint
gregory
for
her
and
their
souls
together
with
certain
of
your
own
prayers
so
god
may
deliver
them
from
that
penitential
fire
so
saying
she
put
a
florin
into
his
hand
which
the
holy
father
blithely
received
and
confirming
her
devoutness
with
fair
words
and
store
of
pious
instances
gave
her
his
benison
and
let
her
go
the
lady
being
gone
the
friar
never
thinking
how
he
was
gulled
sent
for
his
friend
who
coming
and
finding
him
troubled
at
once
divined
that
he
was
to
have
news
of
the
lady
and
awaited
what
the
friar
should
say
the
latter
repeated
that
which
he
had
before
said
to
him
and
bespeaking
him
anew
angrily
and
reproachfully
rebuked
him
severely
of
that
which
according
to
the
lady
report
he
had
done
the
gentleman
not
yet
perceiving
the
friar
drift
faintly
enough
denied
having
sent
her
the
purse
and
the
girdle
so
as
not
to
undeceive
the
friar
in
case
the
lady
should
have
given
him
to
believe
that
he
had
done
this
whereat
the
good
man
was
sore
incensed
and
said
canst
thou
deny
it
wicked
man
that
thou
art
see
here
they
are
for
she
herself
brought
them
to
me
weeping
look
if
thou
knowest
them
the
gentleman
feigned
to
be
sore
abashed
and
answered
i
do
indeed
know
them
and
i
confess
to
you
that
i
did
ill
but
i
swear
to
you
since
i
see
her
thus
disposed
that
you
shall
never
more
hear
a
word
of
this
brief
after
many
words
the
numskull
of
a
friar
gave
his
friend
the
purse
and
the
girdle
and
dismissed
him
after
rating
him
amain
and
beseeching
him
occupy
himself
no
more
with
these
follies
the
which
he
promised
him
the
gentleman
overjoyed
both
at
the
assurance
that
himseemed
he
had
of
the
lady
love
and
at
the
goodly
gift
was
no
sooner
quit
of
the
friar
than
he
betook
himself
to
a
place
where
he
made
shift
to
let
his
mistress
see
that
he
had
the
one
and
the
other
thing
whereat
she
was
mightily
rejoiced
more
by
token
that
herseemed
her
device
went
from
good
to
better
she
now
awaited
nought
but
her
husband
going
abroad
to
give
completion
to
the
work
and
it
befell
not
long
after
that
it
behoved
him
repair
to
genoa
on
some
occasion
or
other
no
sooner
had
he
mounted
to
horse
in
the
morning
and
gone
his
way
than
the
lady
betook
herself
to
the
holy
man
and
after
many
lamentations
said
to
him
weeping
mine
i
tell
you
now
plainly
that
i
can
brook
no
more
but
for
that
i
promised
you
the
other
day
to
do
nought
without
first
telling
you
i
am
come
to
excuse
myself
to
you
and
that
you
may
believe
i
have
good
reason
both
to
weep
and
to
complain
i
will
tell
you
what
your
friend
or
rather
devil
incarnate
did
to
me
this
very
morning
a
little
before
matins
i
know
not
what
ill
chance
gave
him
to
know
that
my
husband
was
to
go
to
genoa
yestermorn
algates
this
morning
at
the
time
i
tell
you
he
came
into
a
garden
of
mine
and
climbing
up
by
a
tree
to
the
window
of
my
bedchamber
which
giveth
upon
the
garden
had
already
opened
the
lattice
and
was
for
entering
when
i
of
a
sudden
awoke
and
starting
up
offered
to
cry
out
nay
would
assuredly
have
cried
out
but
that
he
who
was
not
yet
within
besought
me
of
mercy
in
god
name
and
yours
telling
me
who
he
was
which
when
i
heard
i
held
my
peace
for
the
love
of
you
and
naked
as
i
was
born
ran
and
shut
the
window
in
his
face
whereupon
i
suppose
he
took
himself
off
go
with
him
for
i
heard
no
more
of
him
look
you
now
if
this
be
a
goodly
thing
and
to
be
endured
for
my
part
i
mean
to
bear
with
him
no
more
nay
i
have
already
forborne
him
overmuch
for
the
love
of
you
the
friar
hearing
this
was
the
wrathfullest
man
alive
and
knew
not
what
to
say
except
to
ask
again
and
again
if
she
had
well
certified
herself
that
it
was
indeed
he
and
not
another
to
which
she
answered
be
god
as
if
i
did
not
yet
know
him
from
another
i
tell
you
it
was
himself
and
although
he
should
deny
it
credit
him
not
then
said
the
friar
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
for
it
but
that
this
was
exceeding
effrontery
and
a
thing
exceeding
ill
done
and
in
sending
him
off
as
thou
didst
thou
didst
that
which
it
behoved
thee
to
do
but
i
beseech
thee
since
god
hath
preserved
thee
from
shame
that
like
as
thou
hast
twice
followed
my
counsel
even
so
do
thou
yet
this
once
to
wit
without
complaining
to
any
kinsman
of
thine
leave
it
to
me
to
see
an
i
can
bridle
yonder
devil
broke
loose
whom
i
believed
a
saint
if
i
can
make
shift
to
turn
him
from
this
lewdness
well
and
good
if
not
i
give
thee
leave
henceforth
to
do
with
him
that
which
thy
soul
shall
judge
best
and
my
benison
go
with
thee
then
answered
the
lady
this
once
i
will
well
not
to
vex
or
disobey
you
but
look
you
do
on
such
wise
that
he
be
ware
of
annoying
me
again
for
i
promise
you
i
will
never
again
return
to
you
for
this
cause
thereupon
without
saying
more
she
took
leave
of
the
friar
and
went
away
as
if
in
anger
hardly
was
she
out
of
the
church
when
up
came
the
gentleman
and
was
called
by
the
friar
who
taking
him
apart
gave
him
the
soundest
rating
ever
man
had
calling
him
disloyal
and
forsworn
and
traitor
the
other
who
had
already
twice
had
occasion
to
know
to
what
the
monk
reprimands
amounted
abode
expectant
and
studied
with
embarrassed
answers
to
make
him
speak
out
saying
at
the
first
all
this
passion
sir
have
i
crucified
christ
whereupon
this
shameless
fellow
cried
the
friar
what
he
saith
he
speaketh
as
if
a
year
or
two
were
passed
and
he
had
for
lapse
of
time
forgotten
his
misdeeds
and
his
lewdness
hath
it
then
escaped
thy
mind
between
this
and
matinsong
that
thou
hast
outraged
some
one
this
very
morning
where
wast
thou
this
morning
a
little
before
day

not
answered
the
gentleman
wherever
it
was
the
news
thereof
hath
reached
you
mighty
early
quoth
the
friar
the
news
hath
reached
me
doubtless
thou
supposedst
because
her
husband
was
abroad
that
needs
must
the
gentlewoman
receive
thee
incontinent
in
her
arms
a
fine
thing
indeed
here
a
pretty
fellow
here
an
honourable
man
grown
a
nighthawk
a
a
thinkest
thou
by
importunity
to
overcome
this
lady

that
thou
climbest
up
to
her
windows
anights
by
the
trees
there
is
nought
in
the
world
so
displeasing
to
her
as
thou
yet
must
thou
go
essaying
it
again
and
again
truly
thou
hast
profited
finely
by
my
admonitions
let
alone
that
she
hath
shown
thee
her
aversion
in
many
ways
but
this
i
have
to
say
to
thee
she
hath
up
to
now
not
for
any
love
she
beareth
thee
but
at
my
instant
entreaty
kept
silence
of
that
which
thou
hast
done
but
she
will
do
so
no
more
i
have
given
her
leave
to
do
what
seemeth
good
to
her
an
thou
annoy
her
again
in
aught
what
wilt
thou
do
an
she
tell
her
brothers
the
gentleman
having
now
gathered
enough
of
that
which
it
concerned
him
to
know
appeased
the
friar
as
best
he
knew
and
might
with
many
and
ample
promises
and
taking
leave
of
him
waited
till
matinsong
of
the
ensuing
night
when
he
made
his
way
into
the
garden
and
climbed
up
by
the
tree
to
the
window
he
found
the
lattice
open
and
entering
the
chamber
as
quickliest
he
might
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
his
fair
mistress
who
having
awaited
him
with
the
utmost
impatience
received
him
joyfully
saying
to
my
lord
the
friar
for
that
he
so
well
taught
thee
the
way
hither
then
taking
their
pleasure

of

they
solaced
themselves
together
with
great
delight
devising
and
laughing

simplicity
of

of
a
friar
and
gibing
at

teasels
and
moreover
having
taken
order
for
their
future
converse
they
did
on
such
wise
that
without
having
to
resort
anew
to
my
lord

friar
they
foregathered
in
equal
joyance
many
another

thus
madam
there
are
many
persons
who
what
while
they
study
to
enter
paradise
unwittingly
send
others
thither
the
which
happened
no
great
while
since
to
a
neighbour
of
ours
as
you
shall
hear
according
to
that
which
i
have
heard
tell
there
abode
near
san
pancrazio
an
honest
man
and
a
rich
called
puccio
di
rinieri
who
devoting
himself
in
his
latter
days
altogether
to
religious
practices
became
a
tertiary
of
the
order
of
francis
whence
he
was
styled
fra
puccio
and
ensuing
this
his
devout
life
much
frequented
the
church
for
that
he
had
no
family
other
than
a
wife
and
one
maid
and
consequently
it
behoved
him
not
apply
himself
to
any
craft
being
an
ignorant
fellow
he
said
his
paternosters
went
to
preachments
and
attended
mass
nor
ever
failed
to
be
at
the
lauds
chanted
by
the
seculars
and
fasted
and
mortified
himself
nay
it
was
buzzed
about
that
he
was
of
the
flagellants
his
wife
whose
name
was
mistress
isabetta
a
woman
yet
young
of
to
thirty
years
of
age
fresh
and
fair
and
plump
as
a
kept
by
reason
of
the
piety
and
belike
of
the
age
of
her
husband
much
longer
and
more
frequent
fasts
than
she
could
have
wished
and
when
she
would
have
slept
or
maybe
frolicked
with
him
he
recounted
to
her
the
life
of
christ
and
the
preachments
of
fra
nastagio
or
the
complaint
of
mary
magdalene
or
the
like
meantime
there
returned
home
from
paris
a
monk
hight
dom
felice
conventual
of
san
pancrazio
who
was
young
and
comely
enough
of
person
keen
of
wit
and
a
profound
scholar
and
with
him
fra
puccio
contracted
a
strait
friendship
and
for
that
this
dom
felice
right
well
resolved
him
his
every
doubt
and
knowing
his
pious
turn
of
mind
made
him
a
show
of
exceeding
devoutness
fra
puccio
fell
to
carrying
him
home
bytimes
and
giving
him
to
dine
and
sup
as
the
occasion
offered
and
the
lady
also
for
her
husband
sake
became
familiar
with
him
and
willingly
did
him
honour
the
monk
then
continuing
to
frequent
fra
puccio
house
and
seeing
the
latter
wife
so
fresh
and
plump
guessed
what
should
be
the
thing
whereof
she
suffered
the
most
default
and
bethought
himself
an
he
might
to
go
about
to
furnish
her
withal
himself
and
so
spare
fra
puccio
fatigue
accordingly
craftily
casting
his
eyes
on
her
at
one
time
and
another
he
made
shift
to
kindle
in
her
breast
that
same
desire
which
he
had
himself
which
when
he
saw
he
bespoke
her
of
his
wishes
as
first
occasion
betided
him
but
albeit
he
found
her
well
disposed
to
give
effect
to
the
work
he
could
find
no
means
thereunto
for
that
she
would
on
nowise
trust
herself
to
be
with
him
in
any
place
in
the
world
save
her
own
house
and
there
it
might
not
be
seeing
that
fra
puccio
never
went
without
the
town
at
this
the
monk
was
sore
chagrined
but
after
much
consideration
he
hit
upon
a
device
whereby
he
might
avail
to
foregather
with
the
lady
in
her
own
house
without
suspect
for
all
fra
puccio
should
be
at
home
accordingly
the
latter
coming
one
day
to
visit
him
he
bespoke
him
thus
have
many
a
time
understood
fra
puccio
that
all
thy
desire
is
to
become
a
saint
and
to
this
end
meseemeth
thou
goest
about
by
a
long
road
whereas
there
is
another
and
a
very
short
one
which
the
pope
and
the
other
great
prelates
who
know
and
practise
it
will
not
have
made
known
for
that
the
clergy
who
for
the
most
part
live
by
alms
would
incontinent
be
undone
inasmuch
as
the
laity
would
no
longer
trouble
themselves
to
propitiate
them
with
alms
or
otherwhat
but
for
that
thou
art
my
friend
and
hast
very
honourably
entertained
me
i
would
teach
it
thee
so
i
were
assured
thou
wouldst
practise
it
and
wouldst
not
discover
it
to
any
living
soul
fra
puccio
eager
to
know
the
thing
began
straightway
to
entreat
him
with
the
utmost
instancy
that
he
would
teach
it
him
and
then
to
swear
that
never
save
in
so
far
as
it
should
please
him
would
he
tell
it
to
any
engaging
an
if
it
were
such
as
he
might
avail
to
follow
to
address
himself
thereunto
whereupon
quoth
the
monk
thou
promisest
me
this
i
will
discover
it
to
thee
thou
must
know
that
the
doctors
of
the
church
hold
that
it
behoveth
whoso
would
become
blessed
to
perform
the
penance
which
thou
shalt
hear
but
understand
me
aright
i
do
not
say
that
after
the
penance
thou
wilt
not
be
a
sinner
like
as
thou
presently
art
but
this
will
betide
that
the
sins
which
thou
hast
committed
up
to
the
time
of
the
penance
will
all
by
virtue
thereof
be
purged
and
pardoned
unto
thee
and
those
which
thou
shalt
commit
thereafterward
will
not
be
written
to
thy
prejudice
but
will
pass
away
with
the
holy
water
as
venial
sins
do
now
it
behoveth
a
man
then
in
the
first
place
whenas
he
cometh
to
begin
the
penance
to
confess
himself
with
the
utmost
diligence
of
his
sins
and
after
this
he
must
keep
a
fast
and
a
very
strict
abstinence
for
the
space
of
forty
days
during
which
time
thou
must
abstain
from
touching
not
to
say
other
women
but
even
thine
own
wife
moreover
thou
must
have
in
thine
own
house
some
place
whence
thou
mayst
see
the
sky
by
night
whither
thou
must
betake
thyself
towards
the
hour
of
complines
and
there
thou
must
have
a
wide
plank
set
up
on
such
wise
that
standing
upright
thou
mayst
lean
thy
loins
against
it
and
keeping
thy
feet
on
the
ground
stretch
out
thine
arms
crucifix
fashion
an
thou
wouldst
rest
them
upon
some
peg
or
other
thou
mayst
do
it
and
on
this
wise
thou
must
abide
gazing
upon
the
sky
without
budging
a
jot
till
matins
wert
thou
a
scholar
thou
wouldst
do
well
to
repeat
certain
orisons
i
would
give
thee
but
as
thou
art
it
not
thou
must
say
three
hundred
paternosters
and
as
many
ave
marys
in
honour
of
the
trinity
and
looking
upon
heaven
still
have
in
remembrance
that
god
is
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
and
the
passion
of
christ
abiding
on
such
wise
as
he
abode
on
the
cross
when
the
bell
ringeth
to
matins
thou
mayst
an
thou
wilt
go
and
cast
thyself
clad
as
thou
art
on
thy
bed
and
sleep
and
after
in
the
forenoon
betake
thyself
to
church
and
there
hear
at
least
three
masses
and
repeat
fifty
paternosters
and
as
many
aves
after
which
thou
shalt
with
a
single
heart
do
all
and
sundry
thine
occasions
if
thou
have
any
to
do
and
dine
and
at
evensong
be
in
church
again
and
there
say
certain
orisons
which
i
will
give
thee
by
writ
and
without
which
it
can
not
be
done
then
towards
complines
do
thou
return
to
the
fashion
aforesaid
and
thus
doing
even
as
i
have
myself
done
aforetime
i
doubt
not
but
ere
thou
come
to
the
end
of
the
penance
thou
wilt
provided
thou
shalt
have
performed
it
with
devoutness
and
compunction
feel
somewhat
marvellous
of
eternal
beatitude
quoth
fra
puccio
is
no
very
burdensome
matter
nor
yet
overlong
and
may
very
well
be
done
wherefore
i
purpose
in
name
to
begin
on
sunday
then
taking
leave
of
him
and
returning
home
he
related
everything
in
due
order
to
his
wife
having
the
other
permission
therefor
the
lady
understood
very
well
what
the
monk
meant
by
bidding
him
stand
fast
without
stirring
till
matins
wherefore
the
device
seeming
to
her
excellent
she
replied
that
she
was
well
pleased
therewith
and
with
every
other
good
work
that
he
did
for
the
health
of
his
soul
and
that
so
god
might
make
the
penance
profitable
to
him
she
would
fast
with
him
but
do
no
more
they
being
thus
of
accord
and
sunday
come
fra
puccio
began
his
penance
and
my
lord
monk
having
agreed
with
the
lady
came
most
evenings
to
sup
with
her
bringing
with
him
store
of
good
things
to
eat
and
drink
and
after
lay
with
her
till
matinsong
when
he
arose
and
took
himself
off
whilst
fra
puccio
returned
to
bed
now
the
place
which
fra
puccio
had
chosen
for
his
penance
adjoined
the
chamber
where
the
lady
lay
and
was
parted
therefrom
but
by
a
very
slight
wall
wherefore
master
monk
wantoning
it
one
night
overfreely
with
the
lady
and
she
with
him
it
seemed
to
fra
puccio
that
he
felt
a
shaking
of
the
floor
of
the
house
accordingly
having
by
this
said
an
hundred
of
his
paternosters
he
made
a
stop
there
and
without
moving
called
to
his
wife
to
know
what
she
did
the
lady
who
was
of
a
waggish
turn
and
was
then
belike
astride
of
san
benedetto
his
beast
or
that
of
san
giovanni
gualberto
answered
faith
husband
mine
i
toss
as
most
i
may
quoth
fra
puccio
tossest
what
meaneth
this
tossing
the
lady
laughing
for
that
she
was
a
frolicsome
dame
and
doubtless
had
cause
to
laugh
answered
merrily
you
know
not
what
it
meaneth
why
i
have
heard
you
say
a
thousand
times
who
suppeth
not
by
night
must
toss
till
morning
light
fra
puccio
doubted
not
but
that
the
fasting
was
the
cause
of
her
unableness
to
sleep
and
it
was
for
this
she
tossed
thus
about
the
bed
wherefore
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
said
he
told
thee
not
to
fast
but
since
thou
wouldst
do
it
think
not
of
that
but
address
thyself
to
rest
thou
givest
such
vaults
about
the
bed
that
thou
makest
all
in
the
place
shake
no
care
for
that
answered
the
lady
know
what
i
am
about
do
you
but
well
you
and
i
will
do
as
well
as
i
may
fra
puccio
accordingly
held
his
peace
and
betook
himself
anew
to
his
paternosters
and
after
that
night
my
lord
monk
and
the
lady
let
make
a
bed
in
another
part
of
the
house
wherein
they
abode
in
the
utmost
joyance
what
while
fra
puccio
penance
lasted
at
one
and
the
same
hour
the
monk
took
himself
off
and
the
lady
returned
to
her
own
bed
whereto
a
little
after
came
fra
puccio
from
his
penance
and
on
this
wise
the
latter
continued
to
do
penance
whilst
his
wife
did
her
delight
with
the
monk
to
whom
quoth
she
merrily
now
and
again
hast
put
fra
puccio
upon
performing
a
penance
whereby
we
have
gotten
paradise
indeed
the
lady
finding
herself
in
good
case
took
such
a
liking
to
the
monk
fare
having
been
long
kept
on
low
diet
by
her
husband
that
whenas
fra
puccio
penance
was
accomplished
she
still
found
means
to
feed
her
fill
with
him
elsewhere
and
using
discretion
long
took
her
pleasure
thereof
thus
then
that
my
last
words
may
not
be
out
of
accord
with
my
first
it
came
to
pass
that
whereas
fra
puccio
by
doing
penance
thought
to
win
paradise
for
himself
he
put
therein
the
monk
who
had
shown
him
the
speedy
way
thither
and
his
wife
who
lived
with
him
in
great
lack
of
that

was
in

a

of

family
by

messer
francesco
a
man
of
great
wealth
and
understanding
and
well
advised
in
all
else
but
covetous
beyond
measure
being
made
provost
of
milan
he
had
furnished
himself
with
everything
necessary
for
his
honourable
going
thither
except
only
with
a
palfrey
handsome
enough
for
him
and
finding
none
to
his
liking
he
abode
in
concern
thereof
now
there
was
then
in
the
same
town
a
young
man
called
ricciardo
of
little
family
but
very
rich
who
still
went
so
quaintly
clad
and
so
brave
of
his
person
that
he
was
commonly
known
as
il
zima
and
he
had
long
in
vain
loved
and
courted
messer
francesco
wife
who
was
exceeding
fair
and
very
virtuous
now
he
had
one
of
the
handsomest
palfreys
in
all
tuscany
and
set
great
store
by
it
for
its
beauty
and
it
being
public
to
every
one
that
he
was
enamoured
of
messer
francesco
wife
there
were
those
who
told
the
latter
that
should
he
ask
it
he
might
have
the
horse
for
the
love

bore
his
lady
accordingly
moved

messer

let
call
il

to
him
and
sought
of
him
his
palfrey
by
way
of
sale
so
he
should
proffer
it
to
him
as
a
gift
the
other
hearing
this
was
well
pleased
and
made
answer
to
him
saying
sir
though
you
gave
me
all
you
have
in
the
world
you
might
not
avail
to
have
my
palfrey
by
way
of
sale
but
by
way
of
gift
you
may
have
it
whenas
it
pleaseth
you
on
condition
that
ere
you
take
it
i
may
have
leave
to
speak
some
words
with
your
lady
in
your
presence
but
so
far
removed
from
every
one
that
i
may
be
heard
of
none
other
than
herself
the
gentleman
urged
by
avarice
and
looking
to
outwit
the
other
answered
that
it
liked
him
well
and
that
he
might
speak
with
her
as
much
as
he
would
then
leaving
him
in
the
saloon
of
his
palace
he
betook
himself
to
the
lady
chamber
and
telling
her
how
easily
he
might
acquire
the
palfrey
bade
her
come
hearken
to
il
zima
but
charged
her
take
good
care
to
answer
neither
little
or
much
to
aught
that
he
should
say
to
this
the
lady
much
demurred
but
it
behoving
her
ensue
her
husband
pleasure
she
promised
to
do
his
bidding
and
followed
him
to
the
saloon
to
hear
what
il
zima
should
say
the
latter
having
renewed
his
covenant
with
the
gentleman
seated
himself
with
the
lady
in
a
part
of
the
saloon
at
a
great
distance
from
every
one
and
began
to
say
thus
lady
meseemeth
certain
that
you
have
too
much
wit
not
to
have
long
since
perceived
how
great
a
love
i
have
been
brought
to
bear
you
by
your
beauty
which
far
transcendeth
that
of
any
woman
whom
methinketh
i
ever
beheld
to
say
nothing
of
the
engaging
manners
and
the
peerless
virtues
which
be
in
you
and
which
might
well
avail
to
take
the
loftiest
spirits
of
mankind
wherefore
it
were
needless
to
declare
to
you
in
words
that
this
my
love
is
the
greatest
and
most
fervent
that
ever
man
bore
woman
and
thus
without
fail
will
i
do
so
long
as
my
wretched
life
shall
sustain
these
limbs
nay
longer
for
that
if
in
the
other
world
folk
love
as
they
do
here
below
i
shall
love
you
to
all
eternity
wherefore
you
may
rest
assured
that
you
have
nothing
be
it
much
or
little
worth
that
you
may
hold
so
wholly
yours
and
whereon
you
may
in
every
wise
so
surely
reckon
as
myself
such
as
i
am
and
that
likewise
which
is
mine
and
that
of
this
you
may
take
assurance
by
very
certain
argument
i
tell
you
that
i
should
count
myself
more
graced
did
you
command
me
somewhat
that
i
might
do
and
that
would
pleasure
you
than
if
i
commanding
all
the
world
should
promptliest
obey
me
since
then
i
am
yours
even
as
you
have
heard
it
is
not
without
reason
that
i
dare
to
offer
up
my
prayers
to
your
nobility
wherefrom
alone
can
all
peace
all
health
and
all
derive
for
me
and
no
otherwhence
yea
as
the
humblest
of
your
servants
i
beseech
you
dear
my
good
and
only
hope
of
my
soul
which
midmost
the
fire
of
love
feedeth
upon
its
hope
in
you
that
your
benignity
may
be
so
great
and
your
past
rigour
shown
unto
me
who
am
yours
on
such
wise
be
mollified
that
i
recomforted
by
your
kindness
may
say
that
like
as
by
your
beauty
i
was
stricken
with
love
even
so
by
your
pity
have
i
life
which
latter
an
your
haughty
soul
incline
not
to
my
prayers
will
without
fail
come
to
nought
and
i
shall
perish
and
you
may
be
said
to
be
my
murderer
letting
be
that
my
death
will
do
you
no
honour
i
doubt
not
eke
but
that
conscience
bytimes
pricking
you
therefor
you
will
regret
having
wrought
it
and
whiles
better
disposed
will
say
in
yourself
alack
how
ill
i
did
not
to
have
compassion
upon
my
poor
zima
and
this
repentance
being
of
no
avail
will
cause
you
the
great
annoy
wherefore
so
this
may
not
betide
now
that
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
succour
me
bethink
yourself
and
ere
i
die
be
moved
to
pity
on
me
for
that
with
you
alone
it
resteth
to
make
me
the
happiest
or
the
most
miserable
man
alive
i
trust
your
courtesy
will
be
such
that
you
will
not
suffer
me
to
receive
death
in
guerdon
of
such
and
so
great
a
love
but
will
with
a
glad
response
and
full
of
favour
quicken
my
fainting
spirits
which
flutter
all
dismayed
in
your
presence
therewith
he
held
his
peace
and
heaving
the
deepest
of
sighs
followed
up
with
sundry
tears
proceeded
to
await
the
lady
answer
the
latter
whom
the
long
court
he
had
paid
her
the
joustings
held
and
the
serenades
given
in
her
honour
and
other
like
things
done
of
him
for
the
love
of
her
had
not
availed
to
move
was
moved
by
the
passionate
speech
of
this
most
ardent
lover
and
began
to
be
sensible
of
that
which
she
had
never
yet
felt
to
wit
what
manner
of
thing
love
was
and
albeit
in
ensuance
of
the
commandment
laid
upon
her
by
her
husband
she
kept
silence
she
could
not
withal
hinder
sundry
gentle
sighs
from
discovering
that
which
in
answer
to
il
zima
she
would
gladly
have
made
manifest
il
zima
having
waited
awhile
and
seeing
that
no
response
ensued
was
wondered
and
presently
began
to
divine
the
husband
device
but
yet
looking
her
in
the
face
and
observing
certain
flashes
of
her
eyes
towards
him
now
and
again
and
noting
moreover
the
sighs
which
she
suffered
not
to
escape
her
bosom
with
all
her
strength
conceived
fresh
hope
and
heartened
thereby
took
new
counsel
and
proceeded
to
answer
himself
after
the
following
fashion
she
hearkening
the
while
mine
this
long
time
in
good
sooth
have
i
perceived
thy
love
for
me
to
be
most
great
and
perfect
and
now
by
thy
words
i
know
it
yet
better
and
am
well
pleased
therewith
as
indeed
i
should
be
algates
an
i
have
seemed
to
thee
harsh
and
cruel
i
will
not
have
thee
believe
that
i
have
at
heart
been
that
which
i
have
shown
myself
in
countenance
nay
i
have
ever
loved
thee
and
held
thee
dear
above
all
other
men
but
thus
hath
it
behoved
me
do
both
for
fear
of
others
and
for
the
preserving
of
my
fair
fame
but
now
is
the
time
at
hand
when
i
may
show
thee
clearly
that
i
love
thee
and
guerdon
thee
of
the
love
that
thou
hast
borne
and
bearest
me
take
comfort
therefore
and
be
of
good
hope
for
that
a
few
days
hence
messer
francesco
is
to
go
to
milan
for
provost
as
indeed
thou
knowest
who
hast
for
the
love
of
me
given
him
thy
goodly
palfrey
and
whenas
he
shall
be
gone
i
promise
thee
by
my
troth
and
of
the
true
love
i
bear
thee
that
before
many
days
thou
shalt
without
fail
foregather
with
me
and
we
will
give
gladsome
and
entire
accomplishment
to
our
love
and
that
i
may
not
have
to
bespeak
thee
otherwhiles
of
the
matter
i
tell
thee
presently
that
whenas
thou
shalt
see
two
napkins
displayed
at
the
window
of
my
chamber
which
giveth
upon
our
garden
do
thou
that
same
evening
at
nightfall
make
shift
to
come
to
me
by
the
garden
door
taking
good
care
that
thou
be
not
seen
thou
wilt
find
me
awaiting
thee
and
we
will
all
night
long
have
delight
and
pleasance
one
of
another
to
our
hearts
content
having
thus
spoken
for
the
lady
he
began
again
to
speak
in
his
own
person
and
rejoined
on
this
wise
lady
my
every
sense
is
so
transported
with
excessive
joy
for
your
gracious
reply
that

i
leave
it
to
your

imagine
that
which
for
all
my
will
i
am
unable
to
express
in
words
this
much
only
i
tell
you
that
i
will
without
fail
bethink
myself
to
do
as
you
have
charged
me
and
being
then
peradventure
better
certified
of
so
great
a
grace
as
that
which
you
have
vouchsafed
me
i
will
as
best
i
may
study
to
render
you
the
utmost
thanks
in
my
power
for
the
nonce
there
abideth
no
more
to
say
wherefore
dearest
lady
mine
god
give
you
that
gladness
and
that
weal
which
you
most
desire
and
so
to
him
i
commend
you
for
all
this
the
lady
said
not
a
word
whereupon
il
zima
arose
and
turned
towards
the
husband
who
seeing
him
risen
came
up
to
him
and
said
laughing
deemest
thou
have
i
well
performed
my
promise
to
thee
answered
il
zima
you
promised
to
let
me
speak
with
your
lady
and
you
have
caused
me
speak
with
a
marble
statue
these
words
were
mighty
pleasing
to
the
husband
who
for
all
he
had
a
good
opinion
of
the
lady
conceived
of
her
a
yet
better
and
said
is
thy
palfrey
fairly
mine
is
it
sir
replied
il
zima
had
i
thought
to
reap
of
this
favour
received
of
you
such
fruit
as
i
have
gotten
i
had
given
you
the
palfrey
without
asking
it
of
you
and
would
god
i
had
done
it
for
that
now
you
have
bought
the
palfrey
and
i
have
not
sold
it
the
other
laughed
at
this
and
being
now
provided
with
a
palfrey
set
out
upon
his
way
a
few
days
after
and
betook
himself
to
milan

enter
upon
the

the
lady
left

house
called
to

words
and
the
love
he
bore
her
and
the
palfrey
given
for
her
sake
and
seeing
him
pass
often
by
the
house
said
in
herself
do
i
why
waste
i
my
youth
yonder
man
is
gone

will
not
return
these
six

when
will
he
ever
render
me
them
again
when
i

moreover
when
shall
i
ever
find
such
a
lover
as
il

i
am
alone
and
have
no
one
to
fear
i

not
why
i
should
not
take
this
good
opportunity
what
while
i
may
i
shall
not
always
have
such
leisure
as
i
presently
have
none

know
the
thing
and
even
were
it
to
be

it
is
better
to
do

repent
than
to
abstain

no

was
the
night
come
than
he
betook
himself
secretly
and
alone
to
the
gate
of
the
lady
garden
and
finding
it
open
passed
on
to
another
door
that
opened
into
the
house

he
found
his
mistress
awaiting
him
she
seeing
him
come
started
up
to
meet
him
and
received
him
with
the
utmost
joy
whilst
he
clipped
and
kissed
her
an
hundred
thousand
times
and
followed
her
up
the
stair
to
her
chamber
where
getting
them
to

without
a
moment
delay
they
knew
the
utmost
term
of
amorous
delight

was
this

i
shall
tell
how
one
of
those
who
feign
themselves
so
shy
of
love
was
by
the
ingenuity
of
a
lover
of
hers
brought
to
taste
the
fruits

love
ere

which

afford
you

of
those
already
befallen
in
naples
a
very
ancient
city
and
as
delightful
as
any
in
italy
or
maybe
more
so
there
was
once
a
young
man
illustrious
for
nobility
of
blood
and
noted
for
his
much
wealth
whose
name
was
ricciardo
minutolo
albeit
he
had
to
wife
a
very
fair
and
lovesome
young
lady
he
fell
in
love
with
one
who
according
to
general
opinion
far
overpassed
in
beauty
all
the
other
ladies
of
naples
her
name
was
catella
and
she
was
the
wife
of
another
young
gentleman
of
like
condition
hight
filippello
fighinolfi
whom
like
a
very
virtuous
woman
as
she
was
she
loved
and
cherished
over
all
ricciardo
then
loving
this
catella
and
doing
all
those
things
whereby
the
love
and
favour
of
a
lady
are
commonly
to
be
won
yet
for
all
that
availing
not
to
compass
aught
of
his
desire
was
like
to
despair
and
unknowing
or
unable
to
rid
him
of
his
passion
he
neither
knew
how
to
die
nor
did
it
profit
him
to
live
abiding
in
this
mind
it
befell
that
he
was
one
day
urgently
exhorted
by
certain
ladies
of
his
kinsfolk
to
renounce
this
passion
of
his
seeing
he
did
but
weary
himself
in
vain
for
that
catella
had
none
other
good
than
filippello
of
whom
she
lived
in
such
jealousy
that
she
fancied
every
bird
that
flew
through
the
air
would
take
him
from
her
ricciardo
hearing
of
catella
jealousy
forthright
bethought
himself
how
he
might
compass
his
wishes
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
feign
himself
in
despair
of
her
love
and
to
have
therefore
set
his
mind
upon
another
lady
for
whose
love
he
began
to
make
a
show
of
jousting
and
tourneying
and
doing
all
those
things
which
he
had
been
used
to
do
for
catella
nor
did
he
do
this
long
before
well
nigh
all
the
neapolitans
and
among
the
rest
the
lady
herself
were
persuaded
that
he
no
longer
loved
catella
but
was
ardently
enamoured
of
this
second
lady
and
on
this
wise
he
persisted
until
it
was
so
firmly
believed
not
only
of
others
but
of
catella
herself
that
the
latter
laid
aside
a
certain
reserve
with
which
she
was
wont
to
entreat
him
by
reason
of
the
love
he
bore
her
and
coming
and
going
saluted
him
familiarly
neighbourwise
as
she
did
others
it
presently
befell
that
the
weather
being
warm
many
companies
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
went
according
to
the
usance
of
the
neapolitans
to
divert
themselves
on
the
banks
of
the
sea
and
there
to
dine
and
sup
and
ricciardo
knowing
catella
to
be
gone
thither
with
her
company
betook
himself
to
the
same
place
with
his
friends
and
was
received
into
catella
party
of
ladies
after
allowing
himself
to
be
much
pressed
as
if
he
had
no
great
mind
to
abide
there
the
ladies
and
catella
fell
to
rallying
him
upon
his
new
love
and
he
feigning
himself
sore
inflamed
therewith
gave
them
the
more
occasion
for
discourse
presently
one
lady
going
hither
and
thither
as
commonly
happeneth
in
such
places
and
catella
being
left
with
a
few
whereas
ricciardo
was
the
latter
cast
at
her
a
hint
of
a
certain
amour
of
filippello
her
husband
whereupon
she
fell
into
a
sudden
passion
of
jealousy
and
began
to
be
inwardly
all
afire
with
impatience
to
know
what
he
meant
at
last
having
contained
herself
awhile
and
being
unable
to
hold
out
longer
she
besought
ricciardo
for
that
sake
whom
he
most
loved
to
be
pleased
to
make
her
clear
of
that
which
he
had
said
of
filippello
whereupon
quoth
he
conjure
me
by
such
a
person
that
i
dare
not
deny
aught
you
ask
me
wherefore
i
am
ready
to
tell
it
you
so
but
you
promise
me
that
you
will
never
say
a
word
thereof
either
to
him
or
to
any
other
save
whenas
you
shall
by
experience
have
seen
that
which
i
shall
tell
you
to
be
true

that
when
you
please

will
teach
you
how
you
may
see
it
footnote
or
in
modern
parlance
to
enlighten
her
the
lady
consented
to
that
which
he
asked
and
swore
to
him
never
to
repeat
that
which
he
should
tell
her
believing
it
the
more
to
be
true
then
withdrawing
apart
with
her
so
they
might
not

he
proceeded

an
i
loved
you

once
i
loved
i
should
not
dare
tell
you
aught
which
i
thought
might
vex
you
but
since
that
love
is
passed
away
i
shall
be
less
chary
of
discovering
to
you
the
whole
truth
i
know
not
if
filippello
have
ever
taken
umbrage
at
the
love
i
bore
you

have
believed
that
i
was
ever

you

this
as
it
may

hath
never
personally
shown
me
aught
thereof
but
now
having
peradventure
awaited
a
time
whenas
he
deemed
i
should
be
less
suspicious
it
seemeth
he
would
fain
do
unto
me
that
which
i
misdoubt
me
he
feareth
i
have
done
unto
him
to
wit
he
seeketh
to
have
my
wife
at
his
pleasure
as
i
find
he
hath
for
some
little
time
past
secretly
solicited
her
with
sundry
messages
all
of
which
i
have
known
from
herself
and
she
hath
made
answer
thereunto
according
as
i
have
enjoined
her
this
very
day
however
ere
i
came
hither
i
found
in
the
house
in
close
conference
with
my
wife
a
woman
whom
i
set
down
incontinent
for
that
which
she
was
wherefore
i
called
my
wife
and
asked
her
what
the
woman
wanted
quoth
she
she
is
the
agent
of
filippello
with
whom
thou
hast
saddled
me
by
dint
of
making
me
answer
him
and
give
him
hopes
and
she
saith
that
he
will
know
once
for
all
what
i
mean
to
do
and
that
an
i
will
he
would
contrive
for
me
to
be
privily
at
a
bagnio
in
this
city
nay
of
this
he
prayeth
and
importuneth
me
and
hadst
thou
not
i
know
not
why
caused
me
keep
this
traffic
with
him
i
would
have
rid
myself
of
him
after
such
a
fashion
that
he
should
never
more
have
looked
whereas
i
might
be
thereupon
meseemed
this
was
going
too
far
and
that
it
was
no
longer
to
be
borne
and
i
bethought
myself
to
tell
it
to
you
so
you
might
know
how
he
requiteth
that
entire
fidelity
of
yours
whereby
aforetime
i
was
nigh
upon
death
and
so
you
shall
not
believe
this
that
i
tell
you
to
be
words
and
fables
but
may
whenas
you
have
a
mind
thereto
openly
both
see
and
touch
it
i
caused
my
wife
make
this
answer
to
her
who
awaited
it
that
she
was
ready
to
be
at
the
bagnio
in
question
at
none
whenas
the
folk
sleep
with
which
the
woman
took
leave
of
her
very
well
pleased
now
methinketh
not
you
believe
that
i
will
send
my
wife
thither
but
were
i
in
your
place
i
would
contrive
that
he
should
find
me
there
in
the
room
of
her
he
thinketh
to
meet
and
whenas
i
had
abidden
with
him
awhile
i
would
give
him
to
know
with
whom
he
had
been
and
render
him
such
honour
thereof
as
should
beseem
him
by
which
means
methinketh
you
would
do
him
such
a
shame
that
the
affront
he
would
fain
put
upon
yourself
and
upon
me
would
at
one
blow
be
avenged
catella
hearing
this
without
anywise
considering
who
it
was
that
said
it
to
her
or
suspecting
his
design
forthright
after
the
wont
of
jealous
folk
gave
credence
to
his
words
and
fell
to
his
story
certain
things
that
had
already
befallen
then
fired
with
sudden
anger
she
answered
that
she
would
certainly
do
as
he
counselled
it
was
no
such
great
matter
and
that
assuredly
if
filippello
came
thither
she
would
do
him
such
a
shame
that
it
should
still
recur
to
his
mind
as
often
as
he
saw
a
woman
ricciardo
well
pleased
at
this
and
himseeming
his
device
was
a
good
one
and
in
a
fair
way
of
success
confirmed
her
in
her
purpose
with
many
other
words
and
strengthened
her
belief
in
his
story
praying
her
natheless
never
to
say
that
she
had
heard
it
from
him
the
which
she
promised
him
on
her
troth
next
morning
ricciardo
betook
himself
to
a
good
woman
who
kept
the
bagnio
he
had
named
to
catella
and
telling
her
what
he
purposed
to
do
prayed
her
to
further
him
therein
as
most
she
might
the
good
woman
who
was
much
beholden
to
him
answered
that
she
would
well
and
agreed
with
him
what
she
should
do
and
say
now
in
the
house
where
the
bagnio
was
she
had
a
very
dark
chamber
for
that
no
window
gave
thereon
by
which
the
light
might
enter
this
chamber
she
made
ready
and
spread
a
bed
there
as
best
she
might
wherein
ricciardo
as
soon
as
he
had
dined
laid
himself
and
proceeded
to
await
catella
the
latter
having
heard
ricciardo
words
and
giving
more
credence
thereto
than
behoved
her
returned
in
the
evening
full
of
despite
to
her
house
whither
filippello
also
returned
and
being
by
chance
full
of
other
thought
maybe
did
not
show
her
his
usual
fondness
when
she
saw
this
her
suspicions
rose
yet
higher
and
she
said
in
herself
his
mind
is
occupied
with
yonder
lady
with
whom
he
thinketh
to
take
his
pleasure
but
of
a
surety
this
shall
not
come
to
pass
an
in
this
thought
she
abode
well
nigh
all
that
night
considering
how
she
should
bespeak
him
whenas
she
should
be
with
him
in
the
bagnio
what
more
need
i
say
the
hour
of
none
come
she
took
her
and
without
anywise
changing
counsel
repaired
to
the
bagnio
that
ricciardo
had
named
to
her
and
there
finding
the
good
woman
asked
her
if
filippello
had
been
there
that
day
whereupon
quoth
the
other
who
had
been
duly
lessoned
by
ricciardo
you
the
lady
that
should
come
to
speak
with
him
am
i
answered
catella
said
the
woman
you
in
to
him
catella
who
went
seeking
that
which
she
would
fain
not
have
found
caused
herself
to
be
brought
to
the
chamber
where
ricciardo
was
and
entering
with
covered
head
locked
herself
in
ricciardo
seeing
her
enter
rose
joyfully
to
his
feet
and
catching
her
in
his
arms
said
softly
my
soul
whilst
she
the
better
to
feign
herself
other
than
she
was
clipped
him
and
kissed
him
and
made
much
of
him
without
saying
a
word
fearing
to
be
known
of
him
if
she
should
speak
the
chamber
was
very
dark
wherewith
each
of
them
was
well
pleased
nor
for
long
abiding
there
did
the
eyes
recover
more
power
ricciardo
carried
her
to
the
bed
and
there
without
speaking
lest
their
voices
should
betray
them
they
abode
a
long
while
to
the
greater
delight
and
pleasance
of
the
one
party
than
the
other
but
presently
it
seeming
to
catella
time
to
vent
the
resentment
she
felt
she
began
all
afire
with
rage
and
despite
to
speak
thus
how
wretched
is
women
lot
and
how
ill
bestowed
the
love
that
many
of
them
bear
their
husbands
i
unhappy
that
i
am
these
eight
years
have
i
loved
thee
more
than
my
life
and
thou
as
i
have
felt
art
all
afire
and
all
consumed
with
love
of
a
strange
woman
wicked
and
perverse
man
that
thou
art
now
with
whom
thinkest
thou
to
have
been
thou
hast
been
with
her
whom
thou
hast
too
long
beguiled
with
thy
false
blandishments
making
a
show
of
love
to
her
and
being
enamoured
elsewhere
i
am
catella
not
ricciardo
wife
disloyal
traitor
that
thou
art
hearken
if
thou
know
my
voice
it
is
indeed
i
and
it
seemeth
to
me
a
thousand
years
till
we
be
in
the
light
so
i
may
shame
thee
as
thou
deservest
scurvy
discredited
cur
that
thou
art
alack
woe
is
me
to
whom
have
i
borne
so
much
love
these
many
years
to
this
disloyal
dog
who
thinking
to
have
a
strange
woman
in
his
arms
hath
lavished
on
me
more
caresses
and
more
fondnesses
in
this
little
while
i
have
been
here
with
him
than
in
all
the
rest
of
the
time
i
have
been
his
thou
hast
been
brisk
enough
renegade
cur
that
thou
art
that
usest
at
home
to
show
thyself
so
feeble
and
forspent
and
impotent
but
praised
be
god
thou
hast
tilled
thine
own
field
and
not
as
thou
thoughtest
that
of
another
no
wonder
thou
camest
not
anigh
me
yesternight
thou
lookedst
to
discharge
thee
of
thy
lading
elsewhere
and
wouldst
fain
come
fresh
to
the
battle
but
thanks
to
god
and
my
own
foresight
the
stream
hath
run
in
its
due
channel
why
answerest
thou
not
wicked
man
why
sayst
thou
not
somewhat
art
thou
grown
dumb
hearing
me
cock
faith
i
know
not
what
hindereth
me
from
thrusting
my
hands
into
thine
eyes
and
tearing
them
out
for
thee
thou
thoughtest
to
do
this
treason
very
secretly
but
perdie
one
knoweth
as
much
as
another
thou
hast
not
availed
to
compass
thine
end
i
have
had
better
beagles
at
thy
heels
than
thou
thoughtest
ricciardo
inwardly
rejoiced
at
these
words
and
without
making
any
reply
clipped
her
and
kissed
her
and
fondled
her
more
than
ever
whereupon
quoth
she
following
on
her
speech
thou
thinkest
to
cajole
me
with
thy
feigned
caresses
fashious
dog
that
thou
art
and
to
appease
and
console
me
but
thou
art
mistaken
i
shall
never
be
comforted
for
this
till
i
have
put
thee
to
shame
therefor
in
the
presence
of
all
our
friends
and
kinsmen
and
neighbours
am
i
not
as
fair
as
ricciardo
wife
thou
villain
am
i
not
as
good
a
gentlewoman
why
dost
thou
not
answer
thou
sorry
dog
what
hath
she
more
than
i
keep
thy
distance
touch
me
not
thou
hast
done
enough
feats
of
arms
for
now
thou
knowest
who
i
am
i
am
well
assured
that
all
thou
couldst
do
would
be
perforce
but
so
god
grant
me
grace
i
will
yet
cause
thee
suffer
want
thereof
and
i
know
not
what
hindereth
me
from
sending
for
ricciardo
who
hath
loved
me
more
than
himself
and
could
never
boast
that
i
once
even
looked
at
him
nor
know
i
what
harm
it
were
to
do
it
thou
thoughtest
to
have
his
wife
here
and
it
is
as
if
thou
hadst
had
her
inasmuch
as
it
is
none
of
thy
fault
that
the
thing
hath
miscarried
wherefore
were
i
to
have
himself
thou
couldst
not
with
reason
blame
me
brief
many
were
the
lady
words
and
sore
her
complaining
however
at
last
ricciardo
bethinking
himself
that
an
he
let
her
go
in
that
belief
much
ill
might
ensue
thereof
determined
to
discover
himself
and
undeceive
her
wherefore
catching
her
in
his
arms
and
holding
her
fast
so
she
might
not
get
away
he
said
my
soul
be
not
angered
that
which
i
could
not
have
of
you
by
simply
loving
you
love
hath
taught
me
to
obtain
by
practice
and
i
am
your
ricciardo
catella
hearing
this
and
knowing
him
by
the
voice
would
have
thrown
herself
incontinent
out
of
bed
but
could
not
whereupon
she
offered
to
cry
out
but
ricciardo
stopped
her
mouth
with
one
hand
and
said
this
that
hath
been
may
henceforth
on
nowise
be
undone
though
you
should
cry
all
the
days
of
your
life
and
if
you
cry
out
or
cause
this
ever
anywise
to
be
known
of
any
one
two
things
will
come
thereof
the
one
which
should
no
little
concern
you
will
be
that
your
honour
and
fair
fame
will
be
marred
for
that
albeit
you
may
avouch
that
i
brought
you
hither
by
practice
i
shall
say
that
it
is
not
true
nay
that
i
caused
you
come
hither
for
monies
and
gifts
that
i
promised
you
whereof
for
that
i
gave
you
not
so
largely
as
you
hoped
you
waxed
angry
and
made
all
this
talk
and
this
outcry
and
you
know
that
folk
are
more
apt
to
credit
ill
than
good
wherefore
i
shall
more
readily
be
believed
than
you
secondly
there
will
ensue
thereof
a
mortal
enmity
between
your
husband
and
myself
and
it
may
as
well
happen
that
i
shall
kill
him
as
he
me
in
which
case
you
are
never
after
like
to
be
happy
or
content
wherefore
heart
of
my
body
go
not
about
at
once
to
dishonour
yourself
and
to
cast
your
husband
and
myself
into
strife
and
peril
you
are
not
the
first
woman
nor
will
you
be
the
last
who
hath
been
deceived
nor
have
i
in
this
practised
upon
you
to
bereave
you
of
your
own
but
for
the
exceeding
love
that
i
bear
you
and
am
minded
ever
to
bear
you
and
to
be
your
most
humble
servant
and
although
it
is
long
since
i
and
all
that
i
possess
or
can
or
am
worth
have
been
yours
and
at
your
service
henceforward
i
purpose
that
they
shall
be
more
than
ever
so
now
you
are
well
advised
in
other
things
and
so
i
am
certain
you
will
be
in
this
catella
what
while
ricciardo
spoke
thus
wept
sore
but
albeit
she
was
sore
provoked
and
complained
grievously
nevertheless
her
reason
allowed
so
much
force
to
his
true
words
that
she
knew
it
to
be
possible
that
it
should
happen
as
he
said
wherefore
quoth
she
i
know
not
how
god
will
vouchsafe
me
strength
to
suffer
the
affront
and
the
cheat
thou
hast
put
upon
me
i
will
well
to
make
no
outcry
here
whither
my
simplicity
and
overmuch
jealousy
have
brought
me
but
of
this
be
assured
that
i
shall
never
be
content
till
one
way
or
another
i
see
myself
avenged
of
this
thou
hast
done
to
me
wherefore
leave
me
hold
me
no
longer
thou
hast
had
that
which
thou
desiredst
and
hast
tumbled
me
to
thy
heart
content
it
is
time
to
leave
me
let
me
go
i
prithee
ricciardo
seeing
her
mind
yet
overmuch
disordered
had
laid
it
to
heart
never
to
leave
her
till
he
had
gotten
his
pardon
of
her
wherefore
studying
with
the
softest
words
to
appease
her
he
so
bespoke
and
so
entreated
and
so
conjured
her
that
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
make
peace
with
him
and
of
like
accord
they
abode
together
a
great
while
thereafter
in
the
utmost
delight
moreover
catella
having
thus
learned
how
much
more
savoury
were
the
lover
kisses
than
those
of
the
husband
and
her
former
rigour
being
changed
into
kind
for
ricciardo
from
that
day
forth
she
loved
him
very
tenderly
and
thereafter
ordering
themselves
with
the
utmost
discretion
they
many
a
time
had
joyance
of
their
loves
god
grant
us
to
enjoy
ours
the
seventh
story
day
the
third
tedaldo
elisei
having
fallen
out
with
his
mistress
departeth
florence
and
returning
thither
after
awhile
in
a
pilgrim
favour
speaketh
with
the
lady
and
maketh
her
cognisant
of
her
error
after
which
he
delivereth
her
husband
who
had
been
convicted
of
murdering
him
from
death
and
reconciling
him
with
his
brethren
thenceforward
discreetly
enjoyeth
himself
with
his
mistress
fiammetta
being
now
silent
commended
of
all
the
queen
to
lose
no
time
forthright
committed
the
burden
of
discourse
to
emilia
who
began
thus
it
pleaseth
me
to
return
to
our
city
whence
it
pleased
the
last
two
speakers
to
depart
and
to
show
you
how
a
townsman
of
ours
regained
his
lost
mistress
there
was
then
in
florence
a
noble
youth
whose
name
was
tedaldo
elisei
and
who
being
beyond
measure
enamoured
of
a
lady
called
madam
ermellina
the
wife
of
one
aldobrandino
palermini
deserved
for
his
praiseworthy
fashions
to
enjoy
his
desire
however
fortune
the
enemy
of
the
happy
denied
him
this
solace
for
that
whatever
might
have
been
the
cause
the
lady
after
complying
awhile
with
wishes
suddenly
altogether
withdrew
her
good
graces
from
him
and
not
only
refused
to
hearken
to
any
message
of
his
but
would
on
no
wise
see
him
wherefore
he
fell
into
a
dire
and
cruel
melancholy
but
his
love
for
her
had
been
so
hidden
that
none
guessed
it
to
be
the
cause
of
his
chagrin
after
he
had
in
divers
ways
studied
amain
to
recover
the
love
himseemed
he
had
lost
without
his
fault
and
finding
all
his
labour
vain
he
resolved
to
withdraw
from
the
world
that
he
might
not
afford
her
who
was
the
cause
of
his
ill
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
pine
away
wherefore
without
saying
aught
to
friend
or
kinsman
save
to
a
comrade
of
his
who
knew
all
he
took
such
monies
as
he
might
avail
to
have
and
departing
secretly
came
to
ancona
where
under
the
name
of
filippo
di
sanlodeccio
he
made
acquaintance
with
a
rich
merchant
and
taking
service
with
him
accompanied
him
to
cyprus
on
board
a
ship
of
his
his
manners
and
behaviour
so
pleased
the
merchant
that
he
not
only
assigned
him
a
good
wage
but
made
him
in
part
his
associate
and
put
into
his
hands
a
great
part
of
his
affairs
which
he
ordered
so
well
and
so
diligently
that
in
a
few
years
he
himself
became
a
rich
and
famous
and
considerable
merchant
and
albeit
in
the
midst
of
these
his
dealings
he
oft
remembered
him
of
his
cruel
mistress
and
was
grievously
tormented
of
love
and
yearned
sore
to
look
on
her
again
such
was
his
constancy
that
seven
years
long
he
got
the
better
of
the
battle
but
chancing
one
day
to
hear
sing
in
cyprus
a
song
that
himself
had
made
aforetime
and
wherein
was
recounted
the
love
he
bore
his
mistress
and
she
him
and
the
pleasure
he
had
of
her
and
thinking
it
could
not
be
she
had
forgotten
him
he
flamed
up
into
such
a
passion
of
desire
to
see
her
again
that
unable
to
endure
longer
he
resolved
to
return
to
florence
accordingly
having
set
all
his
affairs
in
order
he
betook
himself
with
one
only
servant
to
ancona
and
transporting
all
his
good
thither
despatched
it
to
florence
to
a
friend
of
the
anconese
his
partner
whilst
he
himself
in
the
disguise
of
a
pilgrim
returning
from
the
holy
sepulchre
followed
secretly
after
with
his
servant
and
coming
to
florence
put
up
at
a
little
hostelry
kept
by
two
brothers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
mistress
house
whereto
he
repaired
first
of
all
to
see
her
an
he
might
however
he
found
the
windows
and
doors
and
all
else
closed
wherefore
his
heart
misgave
him
she
was
dead
or
had
removed
thence
and
he
betook
himself
in
great
concern
to
the
house
of
his
brethren
before
which
he
saw
four
of
the
latter
clad
all
in
black
at
this
he
marvelled
exceedingly
and
knowing
himself
so
changed
both
in
habit
and
person
from
that
which
he
was
used
to
be
whenas
he
departed
thence
that
he
might
not
lightly
be
recognized
he
boldly
accosted
a
cordwainer
hard
by
and
asked
him
why
they
were
clad
in
black
whereto
he
answered
men
are
clad
in
black
for
that
it
is
not
yet
a
fortnight
since
a
brother
of
theirs
who
had
not
been
here
this
great
while
was
murdered
and
i
understand
they
have
proved
to
the
court
that
one
aldobrandino
palermini
who
is
in
prison
slew
him
for
that
he
was
a
of
his
wife
and
had
returned
hither
unknown
to
be
with
her
tedaldo
marvelled
exceedingly
that
any
one
should
so
resemble
him
as
to
be
taken
for
him
and
was
grieved
for
aldobrandino
ill
fortune
then
having
learned
that
the
lady
was
alive
and
well
and
it
being
now
night
he
returned
full
of
various
thoughts
to
the
inn
and
having
supped
with
his
servant
was
put
to
sleep
well
nigh
at
the
top
of
the
house
there
what
with
the
many
thoughts
that
stirred
him
and
the
badness
of
the
bed
and
peradventure
also
by
reason
of
the
supper
which
had
been
meagre
half
the
night
passed
whilst
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
fall
asleep
wherefore
being
awake
himseemed
about
midnight
he
heard
folk
come
down
into
the
house
from
the
roof
and
after
through
the
chinks
of
the
he
saw
a
light
come
up
thither
thereupon
he
stole
softly
to
the
door
and
putting
his
eye
to
the
chink
fell
what
this
might
mean
and
saw
a
comely
enough
lass
who
held
the
light
whilst
three
men
who
had
come
down
from
the
roof
made
towards
her
and
after
some
greetings
had
passed
between
them
one
of
them
said
to
the
girl
praised
be
god
we
may
abide
secure
since
we
know
now
for
certain
that
the
death
of
tedaldo
elisei
hath
been
proved
by
his
brethren
against
aldobrandino
palermini
who
hath
confessed
thereto
and
judgment
is
now
recorded
nevertheless
it
behoveth
to
keep
strict
silence
for
that
should
it
ever
become
known
that
it
was
we
who
slew
him
we
shall
be
in
the
same
danger
as
is
aldobrandino
having
thus
bespoken
the
woman
who
showed
herself
much
rejoiced
thereat
they
left
her
and
going
below
betook
themselves
to
bed
tedaldo
hearing
this
fell
how
many
and
how
great
are
the
errors
which
may
befall
the
minds
of
men
bethinking
him
first
of
his
brothers
who
had
bewept
and
buried
a
stranger
in
his
stead
and
after
of
the
innocent
man
accused
on
false
suspicion
and
brought
by
untrue
witness
to
the
point
of
death
no
less
than
of
the
blind
severity
of
laws
and
rulers
who
ofttimes
under
cover
of
diligent
investigation
of
the
truth
cause
by
their
cruelties
prove
that
which
is
false
and
style
themselves
ministers
of
justice
and
of
god
whereas
indeed
they
are
executors
of
iniquity
and
of
the
devil
after
which
he
turned
his
thought
to
the
deliverance
of
aldobrandino
and
determined
in
himself
what
he
should
do
accordingly
arising
in
the
morning
he
left
his
servant
at
the
inn
and
betook
himself
alone
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
to
the
house
of
his
mistress
where
chancing
to
find
the
door
open
he
entered
in
and
saw
the
lady
seated
all
full
of
tears
and
bitterness
of
soul
in
a
little
ground
floor
room
that
was
there
at
this
sight
he

like
to

for
compassion
of
her
and
drawing

the

hearing
this
lifted
her
eyes
and
said
weeping
man
thou

to
me
a
stranger
pilgrim
what
knowest
thou
of
my

answered
tedaldo
am

but
now
come
hither
being
sent
of

to
turn
your
tears
into
laughter
and
to
deliver
your
husband
from
death
quoth
she
thou
be
of
constantinople
and
newly
come
hither
how
knowest
thou
who
i
am
or
who
is
my
husband
thereupon
the
pilgrim
beginning
from
the
beginning
recounted
to
her
the
whole
history
of
aldobrandino
troubles
and
told
her
who
she
was
and
how
long
she
had
been
married
and
other
things
which
he
very
well
knew
of
her
affairs
whereat
she
marvelled
exceedingly
and
holding
him
for
a
prophet
fell
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
beseeching
him
for
god
sake
an
he
were
come
for
aldobrandino
salvation
to
despatch
for
that
the
time
was
short
the
pilgrim
feigning
himself
a
very
holy
man
said
arise
and
weep
not
but
hearken
well
to
that
which
i
shall
say
to
you
and
take
good
care
never
to
tell
it
to
any
according
to
that
which
god
hath
revealed
unto
me
the
tribulation
wherein
you
now
are
hath
betided
you
because
of
a
sin
committed
by
you
aforetime
which
god
the
lord
hath
chosen
in
part
to
purge
with
this
present
annoy
and
will
have
altogether
amended
of
you
else
will
you
fall
into
far
greater
affliction
answered
the
lady
have
many
sins
and
know
not
which
one
more
than
another
god
the
lord
would
have
me
amend
wherefore
an
you
know
it
tell
me
and
i
will
do
what
i
may
to
amend
it
rejoined
the
pilgrim
know
well
enough
what
it
is
nor
do
i
question
you
thereof
the
better
to
know
it
but
to
the
intent
that
telling
it
yourself
you
may
have
the
more
remorse
thereof
but
let
us
come
to
the
fact
tell
me
do
you
remember
ever
to
have
had
a
lover
the
lady
hearing
this
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
marvelled
sore
supposing
none
had
ever
known
it
albeit
in
the
days
when
he
was
slain
who
had
been
buried
for
tedaldo
there
had
been
some
whispering
thereof
for
certain
words
not
very
discreetly
used
by
confidant
who
knew
it
then
answered
see
that
god
discovereth
unto
you
all
men
secrets
wherefore
i
am
resolved
not
to
hide
mine
own
from
you
true
it
is
that
in
my
youth
i
loved
over
all
the
youth
whose
death
is
laid
to
my
husband
charge
which
death
i
have
bewept
as
sore
as
it
was
grievous
to
me
for
that
albeit
i
showed
myself
harsh
and
cruel
to
him
before
his
departure
yet
neither
his
long
absence
nor
his
unhappy
death
hath
availed
to
tear
him
from
my
heart
quoth
the
pilgrim
hapless
youth
who
is
dead
you
never
loved
but
tedaldo
elisei
ay
but
tell
me
what
was
the
occasion
of
your
falling
out
with
him
did
he
ever
give
you
any
offence
no
replied
she
never
offended
against
me
the
cause
of
the
breach
was
the
prate
of
an
accursed
friar
to
whom
i
once
confessed
me
and
who
when
i
told
him
of
the
love
i
bore
tedaldo
and
the
privacy
i
had
with
him
made
such
a
racket
about
my
ears
that
i
tremble
yet
to
think
of
it
telling
me
that
an
i
desisted
not
therefrom
i
should
go
in
the
devil
mouth
to
the
deepest
deep
of
hell
and
there
be
cast
into
everlasting
fire
whereupon
there
entered
into
me
such
a
fear
that
i
altogether
determined
to
forswear
all
further
converse
with
him
and
that
i
might
have
no
occasion
therefor
i
would
no
longer
receive
his
letters
or
messages
albeit
i
believe
had
he
persevered
awhile
instead
of
getting
him
gone
as
i
presume
in
despair
that
seeing
him
as
i
did
waste
away
like
snow
in
the
sun
my
harsh
resolve
would
have
yielded
for
that
i
had
no
greater
desire
in
the
world

have
it
he
came
to
you

both
with

you
showed
him

so
as
i

it
was
what
cause
should
have
availed
to
move
you
so
harshly
to
withdraw
yourself
from
him
these
things
should
be
pondered
awhile
beforehand
and
if
you
think
you
may
presently
have
cause
to
repent
thereof
as
of
ill
doing
you
ought
not

do

you
might
at
your
pleasure
have
ordained
of
him
as
of

belonged
to
you
that
he
should
no
longer
be
yours

to
go
about
to
deprive
him

you

it

not

it

me
to
speak
of
them
so
you
may
henceforward
know
them
better
than
you
appear
to
have
done
in
the
past
friars

nothing

whereas

they
were
ordained
strait

poor

demonstrative

the
wearers
who
testified
that
they
held
things
temporal

they
wrapped
their
bodies

so
mean
a
habit
those
of
our
time
have
them
made
full

double

glossy

of
the
finest

and
have
brought
them
to
a
quaint
pontifical
cut
insomuch
that
they
think
it
no
shame
to
flaunt
it
withal
in
the
churches
and
public
places
even
as
do
the
laity
with
their
apparel

sin

to
rob

proceedeth
from
malignity
of
mind
that
you
robbed
tedaldo
i
have
already
shown
you
in
despoiling
him
of
yourself
who
had
become
his
of
your
spontaneous
will
and
i
say
also
that
so
far
as
in
you
lay
you
slew
him
for
that
it
was
none
of
your
fault

yourself
as
you
did
hourly
more
cruel
that

slew
not
himself

that
whoso
is
the

ill
that
is
done

held
alike
guilty

doth
it

that
you
were
the
cause
of
his
exile
and
of
his
going
wandering
seven
years
about
the

can
not
be
denied
so
that
in
whichever
one
of
these
three
things
aforesaid
you
have
committed
a

greater
sin
than
in
your

with

tedaldo
deserved
this
usage

default
without
doubt
to
have
been
great
in
that
which
i
wrought
against
tedaldo
and
an
i
might
i
would
gladly
amend
it
on
such
wise
as
you
have
said
but
how
may
this
be
done
tedaldo
can
never
more
return
hither
he
is
dead
wherefore
i
know
not
why
it
should
behove
me
promise
that
which
may
not
be
performed
replied
the
pilgrim
to
that
which
god
hath
revealed
unto
me
tedaldo
is
nowise
dead
but
alive
and
well
and
in
good
case
so
but
he
had
your
favour
quoth
the
lady
what
you
say
i
saw
him
dead
before
my
door
of
several
and
had
him
in
these
arms
and
bathed
his
dead
face
with
many
tears
the
which
it
may
be
gave
occasion
for
that
which
hath
been
spoken
thereof
unseemly
replied
the
pilgrim
you
may
say
i
certify
you
that
tedaldo
is
alive
and
if
you
will
promise
me
that
which
i
ask
with
intent
to
fulfil
your
promise
i
hope
you
shall
soon
see
him
quoth
she
do
i
promise
and
will
gladly
perform
nor
could
aught
betide
that
would
afford
me
such
content
as
to
see
my
husband
free
and
unharmed
and
tedaldo
alive
thereupon
it
seemed
to
tedaldo
time
to
discover
himself
and
to
comfort
the
lady
with
more
certain
hope
of
her
husband
and
accordingly
he
said
in
order
that
i
may
comfort
you
for
your
husband
it
behoveth
me
reveal
to
you
a
secret
which
look
you
discover
not
unto
any
as
you
value
your
life
now
they
were
in
a
very
retired
place
and
alone
the
lady
having
conceived
the
utmost
confidence
of
the
sanctity
which
herseemed
was
in
the
pilgrim
wherefore
tedaldo
pulling
out
a
ring
which
she
had
given
him
the
last
night
he
had
been
with
her
and
which
he
had
kept
with
the
utmost
diligence
and
showing
it
to
her
said
know
you
this
as
soon
as
she
saw
it
she
recognized
it
and
answered
sir
i
gave
it
to
tedaldo
aforetime
whereupon
the
pilgrim
rising
to
his
feet
hastily
cast
off
his
palmer
gown
and
hat
and
speaking
said
know
you
me
when
the
lady
saw
this
she
knew
him
to
be
tedaldo
and
was
all
aghast
fearing
him
as
one
feareth
the
dead
an
they
be
seen
after
death
to
go
as
if
alive
wherefore
she
made
not
towards
him
to
welcome
him
as
tedaldo
returned
from
cyprus
but
would
have
fled
from
him
in
affright
as
he
were
tedaldo
come
back
from
the
tomb
whereupon
quoth
he
not
i
am
your
tedaldo
alive
and
well
and
have
never
died
nor
been
slain
whatsoever
you
and
my
brothers
may
believe
the
lady
somewhat
reassured
and
knowing
his
voice
considered
him
awhile
longer
and
avouched
in
herself
that
he
was
certainly
tedaldo
wherefore
she
threw
herself
weeping
on
his
neck
and
kissed
him
saying
back
sweet
my
tedaldo
tedaldo
having
kissed
and
embraced
her
said
it
is
no
time
now
for
closer
greetings
i
must
go
take
order
that
aldobrandino
may
be
restored
to
you
safe
and
sound
whereof
i
hope
that
ere
come
eventide
you
shall
hear
news
that
will
please
you
nay
if
as
i
expect
i
have
good
news
of
his
safety
i
trust
this
night
to
be
able
to
come
to
you
and
report
them
to
you
at
more
leisure
than
i
can
at
this
present
then
donning
his
gown
and
hat
again
he
kissed
the
lady
once
more
and
bidding
her
be
of
good
hope
took
leave
of
her
and
repaired
whereas
aldobrandino
lay
in
prison
occupied
more
with
fear
of
imminent
death
than
with
hopes
of
deliverance
to
come
tedaldo
with
the
gaoler
consent
went
in
to
him
in
the
guise
of
a
ghostly
comforter
and
seating
himself
by
his
side
said
to
him
i
am
a
friend
of
thine
sent
thee
for
thy
deliverance
by
god
who
hath
taken
pity
on
thee
because
of
thine
innocence
wherefore
if
in
reverence
to
him
thou
wilt
grant
me
a
little
boon
that
i
shall
ask
of
thee
thou
shalt
without
fail
ere
be
night
whereas
thou
lookest
for
sentence
of
death
hear
that
of
thine
acquittance
man
replied
the
prisoner
thou
art
solicitous
of
my
deliverance
albeit
i
know
thee
not
nor
mind
me
ever
to
have
seen
thee
needs
must
thou
be
a
friend
as
thou
sayst
in
truth
the
sin
for
which
they
say
i
am
to
be
doomed
to
death
i
never
committed
though
others
enough
have
i
committed
aforetime
which
it
may
be
have
brought
me
to
this
pass
but
this
i
say
to
thee
of
reverence
to
god
an
he
presently
have
compassion
on
me
i
will
not
only
promise
but
gladly
do
any
thing
however
great
to
say
nothing
of
a
little
one
wherefore
ask
that
which
pleaseth
thee
for
without
fail
if
it
come
to
pass
that
i
escape
with
life
i
will
punctually
perform
it
then
said
the
pilgrim
i
would
have
of
thee
is
that
thou
pardon
tedaldo
four
brothers
the
having
brought
thee
to
this
pass
believing
thee
guilty
of
their
brother
death
and
have
them
again
for
brethren
and
for
friends
whenas
they
crave
thee
pardon
thereof
whereto
quoth
aldobrandino
knoweth
but
he
who
hath
suffered
the
affront
how
sweet
a
thing
is
vengeance
and
with
what
ardour
it
is
desired
nevertheless
so
god
may
apply
himself
to
my
deliverance
i
will
freely
pardon
them
nay
i
pardon
them
now
and
if
i
come
off
hence
alive
and
escape
i
will
in
this
hold
such
course
as
shall
be
to
thy
liking
this
pleased
the
pilgrim
and
without
concerning
himself
to
say
more
to
him
he
exhorted
him
to
be
of
good
heart
for
that
ere
the
ensuing
day
came
to
an
end
he
should
without
fail
hear
very
certain
news
of
his
safety
then
taking
leave
of
him
he
repaired
to
the
seignory
and
said
privily
to
a
gentleman
who
was
in
session
there
lord
every
one
should
gladly
labour
to
bring
to
light
the
truth
of
things
and
especially
those
who
hold
such
a
room
as
this
of
yours
to
the
end
that
those
may
not
suffer
the
penalty
who
have
not
committed
the
crime
and
that
the
guilty
may
be
punished
that
which
may
be
brought
about
to
your
honour
and
the
bane
of
those
who
have
merited
it
i
am
come
hither
to
you
as
you
know
you
have
rigorously
proceeded
against
aldobrandino
palermini
and
thinking
you
have
found
for
truth
that
it
was
he
who
slew
tedaldo
elisei
are
minded
to
condemn
him
but
this
is
most
certainly
false
as
i
doubt
not
to
show
you
ere
midnight
betide
by
giving
into
your
hands
the
murderers
of
the
young
man
in
question
the
worthy
gentleman
who
was
in
concern
for
aldobrandino
willingly
gave
ear
to
the
pilgrim
words
and
having
conferred
at
large
with
him
upon
the
matter
on
his
information
took
the
two
innkeeper
brothers
and
their
servant
without
resistance
in
their
first
sleep
he
would
have
put
them
to
the
question
to
discover
how
the
case
stood
but
they
brooked
it
not
and
each
first
for
himself
and
after
all
together
openly
confessed
that
it
was
they
who
had
slain
tedaldo
elisei
knowing
him
not
being
questioned
of
the
case
they
said
that
it
was
for
that
he
had
given
the
wife
of
one
of
them
sore
annoy
what
while
they
were
abroad
and
would
fain
have
enforced
her
to
do
his
will
the
pilgrim
having
heard
this
with
the
magistrate
consent
took
his
leave
and
repairing
privily
to
the
house
of
madam
ermellina
found
her
alone
and
awaiting
him
all
else
in
the
house
being
gone
to
sleep
alike
desirous
of
having
good
news
of
her
husband
and
of
fully
reconciling
herself
with
her
tedaldo
he
accosted
her
with
a
joyful
countenance
and
said
lady
mine
be
of
good
cheer
for
thou
shalt
certainly
have
thine
aldobrandino
here
again
safe
and
sound
and
to
give
her
more
entire
assurance
thereof
he
fully
recounted
to
her
that
which
he
had
done
whereupon
she
glad
as
ever
woman
was
of
two
so
sudden
and
so
happy
chances
to
wit
the
having
her
lover
alive
again
whom
she
verily
believed
to
have
bewept
dead
and
the
seeing
aldobrandino
free
from
peril
whose
death
she
looked
ere
many
days
to
have
to
mourn
affectionately
embraced
and
kissed
tedaldo
then
getting
them
to
bed
together
with
one
accord
they
made
a
glad
and
gracious
peace
taking
delight
and
joyance
one
of
the
other
whenas
the
day
drew
near
tedaldo
arose
after
showing
the
lady
that
which
he
purposed
to
do
and
praying
her
anew
to
keep
it
a
close
secret
and
went
forth
even
in
his
pilgrim
habit
to
attend
whenas
it
should
be
time
to
aldobrandino
affairs
the
day
come
it
appearing
to
the
seignory
that
they
had
full
information
of
the
matter
they
straightway
discharged
aldobrandino
and
a
few
days
after
let
strike
off
the
murderers
heads
whereas
they
had
committed
the
crime
aldobrandino
being
now
to
the
great
joy
of
himself
and
his
wife
and
of
all
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
free
and
manifestly
acknowledging
that
he
owed
his
deliverance
to
the
good
offices
of
the
pilgrim
carried
the
latter
to
his
house
for
such
time
as
it
pleased
him
to
sojourn
in
the
city
and
there
they
could
not
sate
themselves
of
doing
him
honour
and
worship
especially
the
lady
who
knew
with
whom
she
had
to
do
after
awhile
deeming
it
time
to
bring
his
brothers
to
an
accord
with
aldobrandino
and
knowing
that
they
were
not
only
put
to
shame
by
the
latter
acquittance
but
went
armed
for
fear
of
his
resentment
he
demanded
of
his
host
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
aldobrandino
freely
answered
that
he
was
ready
whereupon
the
pilgrim
caused
him
prepare
against
the
morrow
a
goodly
banquet
whereat
he
told
him
he
would
have
him
and
his
kinsmen
and
kinswomen
entertain
the
four
brothers
and
their
ladies
adding
that
he
himself
would
go
incontinent
and
bid
the
latter
on
his
part
to
peace
and
his
banquet
aldobrandino
consenting
to
all
that
liked
the
pilgrim
the
latter
forthright
betook
himself
to
the
four
brothers
and
plying
them
with
store
of
such
words
as
behoved
unto
the
matter
in
fine
with
irrepugnable
arguments
brought
them
easily
enough
to
consent
to
regain
aldobrandino
friendship
by
asking
pardon
which
done
he
invited
them
and
their
ladies
to
dinner
with
aldobrandino
next
morning
and
they
being
certified
of
his
good
faith
frankly
accepted
the
invitation
accordingly
on
the
morrow
towards
tedaldo
four
brothers
clad
all
in
black
as
they
were
came
with
sundry
of
their
friends
to
the
house
of
aldobrandino
who
stayed
for
them
and
there
in
the
presence
of
all
who
had
been
bidden
of
him
to
bear
them
company
cast
down
their
arms
and
committed
themselves
to
his
mercy
craving
forgiveness
of
that
which
they
had
wrought
against
him
aldobrandino
weeping
received
them
affectionately
and
kissing
them
all
on
the
mouth
despatched
the
matter
in
a
few
words
remitting
unto
them
every
injury
received
after
them
came
their
wives
and
sisters
clad
all
in
raiment
and
were
graciously
received
by
madam
ermellina
and
the
other
ladies
then
were
all
ladies
and
men
alike
magnificently
entertained
at
the
banquet
nor
was
there
aught
in
the
entertainment
other
than
commendable
except
it
were
the
taciturnity
occasioned
by
the
yet
fresh
sorrow
expressed
in
the
sombre
raiment
of
tedaldo
kinsfolk
now
on
this
account
the
device
of
the
banquet
had
been
blamed
of
some
and
he
had
observed
it
wherefore
the
time
being
come
to
do
away
with
the
constraint
aforesaid
he
rose
to
his
feet
according
as
he
had
foreordained
in
himself
what
while
the
rest
still
ate
of
the
fruits
and
said
hath
lacked
to
this
entertainment
that
should
make
it
joyful
save
only
tedaldo
himself
whom
since
having
had
him
continually
with
you
you
have
not
known
him
i
will
discover
to
you
so
saying
he
cast
off
his
palmer
gown
and
all
other
his
weeds
and
abiding
in
a
jerkin
of
green
sendal
was
with
no
little
amazement
long
eyed
and
considered
of
all
ere
any
would
venture
to
believe
it
was
indeed
he
tedaldo
seeing
this
recounted
many
particulars
of
the
relations
and
things
betided
between
them
as
well
as
of
his
own
adventures
whereupon
his
brethren
and
the
other
gentlemen
present
ran
all
to
embrace
him
with
eyes
full
of
joyful
tears
as
after
did
the
ladies
on
like
wise
as
well
strangers
as
kinswomen
except
only
madam
ermellina
which
aldobrandino
seeing
is
this
ermellina
quoth
he
dost
thou
not
welcome
tedaldo
as
do
the
other
ladies
whereto
she
answered
in
the
hearing
of
all
is
none
who
had
more
gladly
welcomed
and
would
yet
welcome
him
than
myself
who
am
more
beholden
to
him
than
any
other
woman
seeing
that
by
his
means
i
have
gotten
thee
again
but
the
unseemly
words
spoken
in
the
days
when
we
mourned
him
whom
we
deemed
tedaldo
made
me
refrain
therefrom
quoth
her
husband
to
thinkest
thou
i
believe
in
the
howlers
he
hath
right
well
shown
their
prate
to
be
false
by
procuring
my
deliverance
more
by
token
that
i
never
believed
it
quick
rise
and
go
and
embrace
him
footnote
lit
barkers
slanderers
the
lady
who
desired
nothing
better
was
not
slow
to
obey
her
husband
in
this
and
accordingly
arising
embraced
tedaldo
as
the
other
ladies
had
done
and
gave
him
joyous
welcome
this
liberality
of
aldobrandino
was
mighty
pleasing
to
tedaldo
brothers
and
to
every
man
and
woman
there
and
thereby
all
suspect
that
had
been
aroused
in
the
minds
of
some
by
the
words
aforesaid
was
done
away
then
every
one
having
given
tedaldo
joy
he
with
his
own
hands
rent
the
black
clothes
on
his
brothers
backs
and
the
on
those
of
his
sisters
and
kinswomen
and
would
have
them
send
after
other
apparel
which
whenas
they
had
donned
they
gave
themselves
to
singing
and
dancing
and
other
diversions
galore
wherefore
the
banquet
which
had
had
a
silent
beginning
had
a
ending
thereafter
with
the
utmost
mirth
they
one
and
all
repaired
even
as
they
were
to
tedaldo
house
where
they
supped
that
night
and
on
this
wise
they
continued
to
feast
several
days
longer
footnote
lit
despite
rancour
but
the
phrase
appears
to
refer
to
the
suspicions
excited
by
the
whispers
that
had
been
current
as
above
mentioned
of
the
connection
between
ermellina
and
tedaldo
the
florentines
awhile
regarded
tedaldo
with
amazement
as
a
man
risen
from
the
dead
nay
in
many
an
one
mind
and
even
in
that
of
his
brethren
there
abode
a
certain
faint
doubt
an
he
were
indeed
himself
and
they
did
not
yet
thoroughly
believe
it
nor
belike
had
they
believed
it
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
for
a
chance
which
made
them
clear
who
the
murdered
man
was
which
was
on
this
wise
there
passed
one
day
before
their
house
certain
footmen
of
lunigiana
who
seeing
tedaldo
made
towards
him
and
said
you
good
day
faziuolo
whereto
tedaldo
in
his
brothers
presence
answered
mistake
me
the
others
hearing
him
speak
were
abashed
and
cried
him
pardon
saying
you
resemble
more
than
ever
we
saw
one
man
favour
another
a
comrade
of
ours
called
faziuolo
of
pontremoli
who
came
hither
some
fortnight
or
more
agone
nor
could
we
ever
since
learn
what
is
come
of
him
indeed
we
marvelled
at
the
dress
for
that
he
was
a
soldier
even
as
we
are
tedaldo
elder
brother
hearing
this
came
forward
and
enquired
how
this
faziuolo
had
been
clad
they
told
him
and
it
was
found
to
have
been
punctually
as
they
said
wherefore
what
with
these
and
what
with
other
tokens
it
was
known
for
certain
that
he
who
had
been
slain
was
faziuolo

himself
to

the
abbot
who
played
the
trick
upon
ferondo
see
post
there
was
then
and
yet
is
in
tuscany
an
abbey
situate
like
as
we
see
many
thereof
in
a
place
not
overmuch
frequented
of
men
whereof
a
monk
was
made
abbot
who
was
a
very
holy
man
in
everything
save
in
the
matter
of
women
and
in
this
he
contrived
to
do
so
warily
that
well
nigh
none
not
to
say
knew
but
even
suspected
him
thereof
for
that
he
was
holden
exceeding
godly
and
just
in
everything
it
chanced
that
a
very
wealthy
farmer
by
name
ferondo
contracted
a
great
intimacy
with
him
a
heavy
clodpate
fellow
and
beyond
measure
whose
commerce
pleased
the
abbot
but
for
that
his
simplicity
whiles
afforded
him
some
diversion
and
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
the
latter
perceived
that
ferondo
had
a
very
handsome
woman
to
wife
of
whom
he
became
so
passionately
enamoured
that
he
thought
of
nothing
else
day
or
night
but
hearing
that
simple
and
as
ferondo
was
in
everything
else
he
was
shrewd
enough
in
the
matter
of
loving
and
guarding
his
wife
he
well
nigh
despaired
of
her
however
like
a
very
adroit
man
as
he
was
he
wrought
on
such
wise
with
ferondo
that
he
came
whiles
with
his
wife
to
take
his
pleasance
in
the
and
there
he
very
demurely
entertained
them
with
discourse
of
the
beatitude
of
the
life
eternal
and
of
the
pious
works
of
many
men
and
women
of
times
past
insomuch
that
the
lady
was
taken
with
a
desire
to
confess
herself
to
him
and
asked
and
had
leave
thereof
accordingly
to
the
abbot
exceeding
pleasure
she
came
to
confess
to
him
and
seating
herself
at
his
feet
before
she
proceeded
to
say
otherwhat
began
thus
if
god
had
given
me
a
right
husband
or
had
given
me
none
it
would
belike
be
easy
to
me
with
the
help
of
your
exhortations
to
enter
upon
the
road
which
you
say
leadeth
folk
unto
life
eternal
but
i
having
regard
to
what
ferondo
is
and
to
his
witlessness
may
style
myself
a
widow
and
yet
i
am
married
inasmuch
as
he
living
i
can
have
no
other
husband
and
dolt
as
he
is
he
is
without
any
cause
so
out
of
all
measure
jealous
of
me
that
by
reason
thereof
i
can
not
live
with
him
otherwise
than
in
tribulation
and
misery
wherefore
ere
i
come
to
other
confession
i
humbly
beseech
you
as
most
i
may
that
it
may
please
you
give
me
some
counsel
concerning
this
for
that
an
the
occasion
of
my
begin
not
therefrom
confession
or
other
good
work
will
profit
me
little
this
speech
gave
the
abbot
great
satisfaction
and
himseemed
fortune
had
opened
him
the
way
to
his
chief
desire
wherefore
quoth
he
can
well
believe
that
it
must
be
a
sore
annoy
for
a
fair
and
dainty
dame
such
as
you
are
to
have
a
blockhead
to
husband
but
a
much
greater
meseemeth
to
have
a
jealous
man
wherefore
you
having
both
the
one
and
the
other
i
can
lightly
credit
that
which
you
avouch
of
your
tribulation
but
for
this
speaking
briefly
i
see
neither
counsel
nor
remedy
save
one
the
which
is
that
ferondo
be
cured
of
this
jealousy
the
medicine
that
will
cure
him
i
know
very
well
how
to
make
provided
you
have
the
heart
to
keep
secret
that
which
i
shall
tell
you
mine
answered
the
lady
no
fear
of
that
for
i
would
liefer
suffer
death
than
tell
any
that
which
you
bid
me
not
repeat
but
how
may
this
be
done
quoth
the
abbot
we
would
have
him
cured
it
behoveth
of
necessity
that
he
go
to
purgatory
how
asked
she
he
go
thither
alive
must
he
die
replied
the
abbot
so
go
thither
and
whenas
he
shall
have
suffered
such
penance
as
shall
suffice
to
purge
him
of
his
jealousy
we
will
pray
god
with
certain
orisons
that
he
restore
him
to
this
life
and
he
will
do
it
said
the
lady
am
to
become
a
widow
answered
the
abbot
a
certain
time
wherein
you
must
look
well
you
suffer
not
yourself
to
be
married
again
for
that
god
would
take
it
in
ill
part
and
whenas
ferondo
returned
hither
it
would
behove
you
return
to
him
and
he
would
then
be
more
jealous
than
ever
quoth
she
he
be
but
cured
of
this
calamity
so
it
may
not
behove
me
abide
in
prison
all
my
life
i
am
content
do
as
it
pleaseth
you
i
will
do
it
rejoined
he
what
guerdon
am
i
to
have
of
you
for
such
a
service
answered
the
lady
shall
have
whatsoever
pleaseth
you
so
but
it
be
in
my
power
but
what
can
the
like
of
me
that
may
befit
such
a
man
as
yourself
replied
the
abbot
can
do
no
less
for
me
than
that
which
i
undertake
to
do
for
you
for
that
like
as
i
am
disposed
to
do
that
which
is
to
be
your
weal
and
your
solacement
even
so
can
you
do
that
which
will
be
the
saving
and
assainment
of
my
life
quoth
she
it
be
so
i
am
ready
said
the
abbot
must
give
me
your
love
and
vouchsafe
me
satisfaction
of
yourself
for
whom
i
am
all
afire
with
love
and
languishment
footnote
i
will
cure
your
husband
of
his
jealousy
the
lady
hearing
this
was
all
aghast
and
answered
father
mine
what
is
this
you
ask
methought
you
were
a
saint
doth
it
beseem
holy
men
to
require
women
who
come
to
them
for
counsel
of
such
things
my
soul
rejoined
the
abbot
not
for
that
sanctity
nowise
abateth
by
this
seeing
it
hath
its
seat
in
the
soul
and
that
which
i
ask
of
you
is
a
sin
of
the
body
but
be
that
as
it
may
your
ravishing
beauty
hath
had
such
might
that
love
constraineth
me
to
do
thus
and
i
tell
you
that
you
may
glory
in
your
charms
over
all
other
women
considering
that
they
please
holy
men
who
are
used
to
look
upon
the
beauties
of
heaven
moreover
abbot
though
i
be
i
am
a
man
like
another
and
am
as
you
see
not
yet
old
nor
should
this
that
i
ask
be
grievous
to
you
to
do
nay
you
should
rather
desire
it
for
that
what
while
ferondo
sojourneth
in
purgatory
i
will
bear
you
company
by
night
and
render
you
that
solacement
which
he
should
give
you
nor
shall
any
ever
come
to
know
of
this
for
that
every
one
believeth
of
me
that
and
more
than
that
which
you
but
now
believed
of
me
reject
not
the
grace
that
god
sendeth
you
for
there
be
women
enough
who
covet
that
which
you
may
have
and
shall
have
if
like
a
wise
woman
you
hearken
to
my
counsel
moreover
i
have
fair
and
precious
jewels
which
i
purpose
shall
belong
to
none
other
than
yourself
do
then
for
me
sweet
my
hope
that
which
i
willingly
do
for
you
the
lady
hung
her
head
knowing
not
how
to
deny
him
whilst
herseemed
it
were
ill
done
to
grant
him
what
he
asked
but
the
abbot
seeing
that
she
hearkened
and
hesitated
to
reply
and
himseeming
he
had
already
half
converted
her
followed
up
his
first
words
with
many
others
and
stayed
not
till
he
had
persuaded
her
that
she
would
do
well
to
comply
with
him
accordingly
she
said
blushing
that
she
was
ready
to
do
his
every
commandment
but
might
not
avail
thereto
till
such
time
as
ferondo
should
be
gone
to
purgatory
whereupon
quoth
the
abbot
exceeding
well
pleased
we
will
make
shift
to
send
him
thither
incontinent
do
you
but
contrive
that
he
come
hither
or
next
day
to
sojourn
with
me
so
saying
he
privily
put
a
very
handsome
ring
into
her
hand
and
dismissed
her
the
lady
rejoiced
at
the
gift
and
looking
to
have
others
rejoined
her
companions
to
whom
she
fell
to
relating
marvellous
things
of
the
abbot
sanctity
and
presently
returned
home
with
them
a
few
days
after
ferondo
repaired
to
the
abbey
whom
whenas
the
abbot
saw
he
cast
about
to
send
him
to
purgatory
accordingly
he
sought
out
a
powder
of
marvellous
virtue
which
he
had
gotten
in
the
parts
of
the
levant
of
a
great
prince
who
avouched
it
to
be
that
which
was
wont
to
be
used
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
whenas
he
would
fain
send
any
one
sleeping
into
his
paradise
or
bring
him
forth
thereof
and
that
according
as
more
or
less
thereof
was
given
without
doing
any
hurt
it
made
him
who
took
it
sleep
more
or
less
time
on
such
wise
that
whilst
its
virtue
lasted
none
would
say
he
had
life
in
him
of
this
he
took
as
much
as
might
suffice
to
make
a
man
sleep
three
days
and
putting
it
in
a
beaker
of
wine
that
was
not
yet
well
cleared
gave
it
to
ferondo
to
drink
in
his
cell
without
the
latter
suspecting
aught
after
which
he
carried
him
into
the
cloister
and
there
with
some
of
his
monks
fell
to
making
sport
of
him
and
his
dunceries
nor
was
it
long
before
the
powder
working
ferondo
was
taken
with
so
sudden
and
overpowering
a
drowsiness
that
he
slumbered
as
yet
he
stood
afoot
and
presently
fell
down
fast
asleep
footnote
the

in

boccaccio
seems
to
have
taken
his
idea
of
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
from
marco
polo
whose
travels
published
in
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
give
a
most
romantic
account
of
that
chieftain
and
his
followers
the
abbot
made
a
show
of
being
concerned
at
this
accident
and
letting
untruss
him
caused
fetch
cold
water
and
cast
it
in
his
face
and
essay
many
other
remedies
of
his
fashion
as
if
he
would
recall
the
strayed
life
and
senses
from
the
oppression
of
some
fumosity
of
the
stomach
or
what
not
like
affection
that
had
usurped
them
the
monks
seeing
that
for
all
this
he
came
not
to
himself
and
feeling
his
pulse
but
finding
no
sign
of
life
in
him
all
held
it
for
certain
that
he
was
dead
accordingly
they
sent
to
tell
his
wife
and
his
kinsfolk
who
all
came
thither
forthright
and
the
lady
having
bewept
him
awhile
with
her
kinswomen
the
abbot
caused
lay
him
clad
as
he
was
in
a
tomb
whilst
the
lady
returned
to
her
house
and
giving
out
that
she
meant
never
to
part
from
a
little
son
whom
she
had
had
by
her
husband
abode
at
home
and
occupied
herself
with
the
governance
of
the
child
and
of
the
wealth
which
had
been
ferondo
meanwhile
the
abbot
arose
stealthily
in
the
night
and
with
the
aid
of
a
bolognese
monk
in
whom
he
much
trusted
and
who
was
that
day
come
thither
from
bologna
took
up
ferondo
out
of
the
tomb
and
carried
him
into
a
vault
in
which
there
was
no
light
to
be
seen
and
which
had
been
made
for
prison
of
such
of
the
monks
as
should
make
default
in
aught
there
they
pulled
off
his
garments
and
clothing
him
laid
him
on
a
truss
of
straw
and
there
left
him
against
he
should
recover
his
senses
whilst
the
bolognese
monk
having
been
instructed
by
the
abbot
of
that
which
he
had
to
do
without
any
else
knowing
aught
thereof
proceeded
to
await
his
coming
to
himself
on
the
morrow
the
abbot
accompanied
by
sundry
of
his
monks
betook
himself
by
way
of
visitation
to
the
house
of
the
lady
whom
he
found
clad
in
black
and
in
great
tribulation
and
having
comforted
her
awhile
he
softly
required
her
of
her
promise
the
lady
finding
herself
free
and
unhindered
of
ferondo
or
any
other
and
seeing
on
his
finger
another
fine
ring
replied
that
she
was
ready
and
appointed
him
to
come
to
her
that
same
night
accordingly
night
come
the
abbot
disguised
in
ferondo
clothes
and
accompanied
by
the
monk
his
confidant
repaired
thither
and
lay
with
her
in
the
utmost
delight
and
pleasance
till
the
morning
when
he
returned
to
the
abbey
after
this
he
very
often
made
the
same
journey
on
a
like
errand
and
being
whiles
encountered
coming
or
going
of
one
or
another
of
the
villagers
it
was
believed
he
was
ferondo
who
went
about
those
parts
doing
penance
by
reason
whereof
many
strange
stories
were
after
bruited
about
among
the
simple
countryfolk
and
this
was
more
than
once
reported
to
ferondo
wife
who
well
knew
what
it
was
as
for
ferondo
when
he
recovered
his
senses
and
found
himself
he
knew
not
where
the
bolognese
monk
came
in
to
him
with
a
horrible
noise
and
laying
hold
of
him
gave
him
a
sound
drubbing
with
a
rod
he
had
in
his
hand
ferondo
weeping
and
crying
out
did
nought
but
ask
am
i
to
which
the
monk
answered
art
in
purgatory
cried
ferondo
i
then
dead
certes
replied
the
other
whereupon
ferondo
fell
to
bemoaning
himself
and
his
wife
and
child
saying
the
oddest
things
in
the
world
presently
the
monk
brought
him
somewhat
of
meat
and
drink
which
ferondo
seeing
cried
he
the
dead
eat
do
they
answered
the
monk
that
i
bring
thee
is
what
the
woman
thy
wife
that
was
sent
this
morning
to
the
church
to
let
say
masses
for
thy
soul
and
god
the
lord
willeth
that
it
be
made
over
to
thee
quoth
ferondo
grant
her
a
good
year
i
still
cherished
her
ere
i
died
insomuch
that
i
held
her
all
night
in
mine
arms
and
did
nought
but
kiss
her
and
t
other
thing
also
i
did
when
i
had
a
mind
thereto
then
being
very
he
fell
to
eating
and
drinking
and
himseeming
the
wine
was
not
overgood
confound
her
quoth
he
did
not
she
give
the
priest
wine
of
the
cask
against
the
wall
after
he
had
eaten
the
monk
laid
hold
of
him
anew
and
gave
him
another
sound
beating
with
the
same
rod
whereat
ferondo
roared
out
lustily
and
said
why
dost
thou
this
to
me
quoth
the
monk
thus
hath
god
the
lord
ordained
that
it
be
done
unto
thee
twice
every
day
for
what
cause
asked
ferondo
answered
the
monk
wast
jealous
having
the
best
woman
in
the
country
to
wife
said
ferondo
sayst
sooth
ay
and
the
kindest
creature
she
was
sweeter
than
syrup
but
i
knew
not
that
god
the
lord
held
it
for
ill
that
a
man
should
be
jealous
else
had
i
not
been
so
quoth
the
monk
shouldst
have
bethought
thyself
of
that
whenas
thou
wast
there
below
and
have
amended
thee
thereof
and
should
it
betide
that
thou
ever
return
thither
look
thou
so
have
in
mind
that
which
i
do
unto
thee
at
this
present
that
thou
be
nevermore
jealous
said
ferondo
the
dead
ever
return
thither
answered
the
monk
god
willeth
cried
ferondo
i
ever
return
thither
i
will
be
the
best
husband
in
the
world
i
will
never
beat
her
nor
give
her
an
ill
word
except
it
be
anent
the
wine
she
sent
hither
this
morning
and
for
that
she
sent
no
candles
so
it
behoved
me
to
eat
in
the
dark
said
the
monk
sent
candles
enough
but
they
were
all
burnt
for
the
masses
rejoined
ferondo
assuredly
an
i
return
thither
i
will
let
her
do
what
she
will
but
tell
me
who
art
thou
that
usest
me
thus
quoth
the
monk
also
am
dead
i
was
of
sardinia
and
for
that
aforetime
i
much
commended
a
master
of
mine
of
being
jealous
i
have
been
doomed
of
god
to
this
punishment
that
i
must
give
thee
to
eat
and
drink
and
beat
thee
thus
till
such
time
as
god
shall
ordain
otherwhat
of
thee
and
of
me
then
said
ferondo
there
none
here
other
than
we
twain
answered
the
monk
be
folk
by
the
thousands
but
thou
canst
neither
see
nor
hear
them
nor
they
thee
quoth
ferondo
how
far
are
we
from
our
own
countries
replied
the
other
are
distant
thence
more
miles
than
we
can
well
cack
at
a
bout
rejoined
the
farmer
is
far
enough
meseemeth
we
must
be
out
of
the
world
an
it
be
so
much
as
all
that
footnote
in
the
sublunary
world
in
such
and
the
like
discourse
was
ferondo
entertained
half
a
score
months
with
eating
and
drinking
and
beating
what
while
the
abbot
assiduously
visited
the
fair
lady
without
miscarriage
and
gave
himself
the
goodliest
time
in
the
world
with
her
at
last
as
would
have
it
the
lady
found
herself
with
child
and
straightway
acquainted
the
abbot
therewith
wherefore
it
seemed
well
to
them
both
that
ferondo
should
without
delay
be
recalled
from
purgatory
to
life
and
return
to
her
so
she
might
avouch
herself
with
child
by
him
accordingly
the
abbot
that
same
night
caused
call
to
ferondo
in
prison
with
a
counterfeit
voice
saying
take
comfort
for
it
is
god
pleasure
that
thou
return
to
the
world
where
thou
shalt
have
a
son
by
thy
wife
whom
look
thou
name
benedict
for
that
by
the
prayers
of
thy
holy
abbot
and
of
thy
wife
and
for
the
love
of
benedict
he
doth
thee
this
favour
ferondo
hearing
this
was
exceedingly
rejoiced
and
said
liketh
me
well
lord
grant
a
good
year
to
seignior
god
almighty
and
to
the
abbot
and
benedict
and
my
cheesy
sweet
honey
wife
the
abbot
let
give
him
in
the
wine
that
he
sent
him
so
much
of
the
powder
aforesaid
as
should
cause
him
sleep
maybe
four
hours
and
with
the
aid
of
his
monk
having
put
his
own
clothes
on
him
restored
him
privily
to
the
tomb
wherein
he
had
been
buried
footnote
meaning
that
he
loves
her
as
well
as
he
loves
cheese
for
which
it
is
well
known
that
the
italian
has
a
romantic
passion
according
to
alexandre
dumas
the
italian
loves
cheese
so
well
that
he
has
succeeded
in
introducing
it
into
everything
he
eats
or
drinks
with
the
one
exception
of
coffee
next
morning
at
break
of
day
ferondo
came
to
himself
and
espying
light
a
thing
which
he
had
not
seen
for
good
ten
months
through
some
crevice
of
the
tomb
doubted
not
but
he
was
alive
again
accordingly
he
fell
to
bawling
out
to
me
open
to
me
and
heaving
so
lustily
at
the
lid
of
the
tomb
with
his
head
that
he
stirred
it
for
that
it
was
eath
to
move
and
had
begun
to
move
it
away
when
the
monks
having
now
made
an
end
of
saying
matins
ran
thither
and
knew
ferondo
voice
and
saw
him
in
act
to
come
forth
of
the
sepulchre
whereupon
all
aghast
for
the
strangeness
of
the
case
they
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
to
the
abbot
who
made
a
show
of
rising
from
prayer
and
said
sons
have
no
fear
take
the
cross
and
the
holy
water
and
follow
after
me
so
we
may
see
that
which
god
willeth
to
show
forth
to
us
of
his
might
and
as
he
said
so
he
did
now
ferondo
was
come
forth
of
the
sepulchre
all
pale
as
well
might
he
be
who
had
so
long
abidden
without
seeing
the
sky
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
abbot
he
ran
to
cast
himself
at
his
feet
and
said
mine
according
to
that
which
hath
been
revealed
to
me
your
prayers
and
those
of
benedict
and
my
wife
have
delivered
me
from
the
pains
of
purgatory
and
restored
me
to
life
wherefore
i
pray
god
to
give
you
a
good
year
and
good
calends
now
and
always
quoth
the
abbot
be
god
his
might
go
my
son
since
he
hath
sent
thee
back
hither
comfort
thy
wife
who
hath
been
still
in
tears
since
thou
departedst
this
life
and
henceforth
be
a
friend
and
servant
of
god
replied
ferondo
hath
it
indeed
been
said
to
me
only
leave
me
do
for
as
soon
as
i
find
her
i
shall
buss
her
such
goodwill
do
i
bear
her
the
abbot
left
alone
with
his
monks
made
a
great
show
of
wonderment
at
this
miracle
and
caused
devoutly
sing
miserere
therefor
as
for
ferondo
he
returned
to
his
village
where
all
who
saw
him
fled
as
men
use
to
do
from
things
frightful
but
he
called
them
back
and
avouched
himself
to
be
raised
up
again
his
wife
on
like
wise
feigned
to
be
adread
of
him
but
after
the
folk
were
somewhat
reassured
anent
him
and
saw
that
he
was
indeed
alive
they
questioned
him
of
many
things
and
he
as
it
were
he
had
returned
wise
made
answer
to
all
and
gave
them
news
of
the
souls
of
their
kinsfolk
making
up
of
his
own
motion
the
finest
fables
in
the
world
of
the
affairs
of
purgatory
and
recounting
in
full
assembly
the
revelation
made
him
by
the
mouth
of
the
rangel

ere
he
was
raised
up
again
then
returning
to
his
house
and
entering
again
into

his
goods
he
got
his
wife

there
was
in
the
kingdom
of
france
a
gentleman
called
isnard
count
of
roussillon
who
for
that
he
was
scant
of
health
still
entertained
about
his
person
a
physician
by
name
master
gerard
de
narbonne
the
said
count
had
one
little
son
and
no

hight
bertrand
who
was
exceeding
handsome
and
agreeable
and
with
him
other
children
of
his
own
age
were
brought
up
among
these
latter
was
a
daughter
of
the

physician
by

gillette

vowed
to

an

love

fervent
more
than
pertained
unto

the
count
dying
and
leaving
his
son
in
the
hands
of
the
king
it
behoved
him
betake
himself
to
paris
whereof
the
damsel
abode
sore
disconsolate
and
her
own
father
dying
no
great
while
after
she
would
fain
an
she
might
have
had
a
seemly
occasion
have
gone
to
paris
to
see
bertrand
but
being
straitly
guarded
for
that
she
was
left
rich
and
alone
she
saw
no
honourable
way
thereto
and
being
now
of
age
for
a
husband
and
having
never
been
able
to
forget
bertrand
she
had
without
reason
assigned
refused
many

whom
her
kinsfolk
would
have
married

it
befell
that
what
while
she
burned
more
than
ever
for
love
of
bertrand
for
that
she
heard
he
was
grown
a
very
goodly
gentleman
news
came
to
her
how
the
king
of
france
by
an
imposthume
which
he
had
had
in
his
breast
and
which
had
been
ill
tended
had
gotten
a
fistula
which
occasioned
him
the
utmost
anguish
and
annoy
nor
had
he
yet
been
able
to
find
a
physician
who
might
avail
to
recover
him
thereof
albeit
many
had
essayed
it
but
all
had
aggravated
the
ill
wherefore
the
king
despairing
of
cure
would
have
no
more
counsel
nor
aid
of
any
hereof
the
young
lady
was
beyond
measure
content
and
bethought
herself
that
not
only
would
this
furnish
her
with
a
legitimate
occasion
of
going
to
paris
but
that
should
the
king
ailment
be
such
as
she
believed
she
might
lightly
avail
to
have
bertrand
to
husband
accordingly
having
aforetime
learned
many
things
of
her
father
she
made
a
powder
of
certain
simples
useful
for
such
an
infirmity
as
she
conceived
the
king
to
be
and
taking
horse
repaired
to
paris
before
aught
else
she
studied
to
see
bertrand
and
next
presenting
herself
before
the
king
she
prayed
him
of
his
favour
to
show
her
his
ailment
the
king
seeing
her
a
fair
and
engaging
damsel
knew
not
how
to
deny
her
and
showed
her
that
which
ailed
him
whenas
she
saw
it
she
was
certified
incontinent
that
she
could
heal
it
and
accordingly
said
lord
an
it
please
you
i
hope
in
god
to
make
you
whole
of
this
your
infirmity
in
eight
days
time
without
annoy
or
fatigue
on
your
part
the
king
scoffed
in
himself
at
her
words
saying
which
the
best
physicians
in
the
world
have
availed
not
neither
known
to
do
how
shall
a
young
woman
know
accordingly
he
thanked
her
for
her
good
will
and
answered
that
he
was
resolved
no
more
to
follow
the
counsel
of
physicians
whereupon
quoth
the
damsel
lord
you
make
light
of
my
skill
for
that
i
am
young
and
a
woman
but
i
would
have
you
bear
in
mind
that
i
medicine
not
of
mine
own
science
but
with
the
aid
of
god
and
the
science
of
master
gerard
de
narbonne
who
was
my
father
and
a
famous
physician
whilst
he
lived

king
hearing
this
said
in
himself
may
be
this
woman
is
sent
me
of
god
why
should
i
not
make
proof
of
her
knowledge
since
she
saith
she
will
without
annoy
of
mine
cure
me
in
little
time
accordingly
being
resolved
to
essay
her
he
said
and
if
you
cure
us
not
after
causing
us
break
our
resolution
what
will
you
have
ensue
to
you
therefor
lord
answered
she
a
guard
upon
me
and
if
i
cure
you
not
within
eight
days
let
burn
me
alive
but
if
i
cure
you
what
reward
shall
i
have
quoth
the
king
seem
as
yet
unhusbanded
if
you
do
this
we
will
marry
you
well

worshipfully

young
lady
am
well
pleased
that
you
should
marry
me

i
will
have
a
husband
such
as
i
shall
ask
of
you
excepting
always
any
one
of
your
sons
or
of
the
royal
house
he
readily
promised
her
that
which
she
sought
whereupon
she
began
her
cure
and
in
brief
before
the
term
limited
she
brought
him
back
to
health
the
king
feeling
himself
healed
said
you
have
well
earned
your
husband
whereto
she
answered
my
lord
i
have
earned
bertrand
de
roussillon
whom
i
began
to
love
even
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
and
have
ever
since
loved
over
all
the
king
deemed
it
a
grave
matter
to
give
him
to
her
nevertheless
having
promised
her
and
unwilling
to
fail
of
his
faith
he
let
call
the
count
to
himself
and
bespoke
him
thus
you
are
now
of
age
and
accomplished
in
all
that
behoveth
unto
man
estate
wherefore
it
is
our
pleasure
that
you
return
to
govern
your
county
and
carry
with
you
a
damsel
whom
we
have
given
you
to
wife
who
is
the
damsel
my
lord
asked
bertrand
to
which
the
king
answered
is
she
who
hath
with
her
medicines
restored
to
us
our
health

loveth
you
dear
wherefore
we
doubt
not
but
you
will
have
a

happier

her

lady

higher

bertrand
held
his
peace
and
the
king
let
make
great
preparations
for
the
celebration
of
the
marriage
the
appointed
day
being
come
bertrand
sore
against
his
will
in
the
presence
of
the
king
espoused
the
damsel
who
loved
him
more
than
herself
this
done
having
already
determined
in
himself
what
he
should
do
he
sought
leave
of
the
king
to
depart
saying
he
would
fain
return
to
his
county
and
there
consummate
the
marriage
then
taking
horse
he
repaired
not
thither
but
betook
himself
into
tuscany
where
hearing
that
the
florentines
were
at
war
with
those
of
sienna
he
determined
to
join
himself
to
the
former
by
whom
he
was
joyfully
received
and
made
captain
over
a
certain
number
of
and
there
being
well
provided
of
them
he
abode
a
pretty
while
in
their
service
footnote
getting
good
pay
and
allowances
buona
the
wife
ill
content
with
such
a
lot
but
hoping
by
her
fair
dealing
to
recall
him
to
his
county
betook
herself
to
roussillon
where
she
was
received
of
all
as
their
liege
lady
there
finding
everything
waste
and
disordered
for
the
long
time
that
the
land
had
been
without
a
lord
with
great
diligence
and
solicitude
like
a
discreet
lady
as
she
was
she
set
all
in
order
again
whereof
the
count
vassals
were
mightily
content
and
held
her
exceeding
dear
vowing
her
a
great
love
and
blaming
the
count
sore
for
that
he
accepted
not
of
her
the
lady
having
thoroughly
ordered
the
county
notified
the
count
thereof
by
two
knights
whom
she
despatched
to
him
praying
him
that
an
it
were
on
her
account
he
forbore
to
come
to
his
county
he
should
signify
it
to
her
and
she
to
pleasure
him
would
depart
thence
but
he
answered
them
very
harshly
saying
that
let
her
do
her
pleasure
i
for
my
part
will
return
thither
to
abide
with
her
whenas
she
shall
have
this
my
ring
on
her
finger
and
in
her
arms
a
son
by
me
begotten
now
the
ring
in
question
he
held
very
dear
and
never
parted
with
it
by
reason
of
a
certain
virtue
which
it
had
been
given
him
to
understand
that
it
had
the
knights
understood
the
hardship
of
the
condition
implied
in
these
two
well
nigh
impossible
requirements
but
seeing
that
they
might
not
by
their
words
avail
to
move
him
from
his
purpose
they
returned
to
the
lady
and
reported
to
her
his
reply
whereat
she
was
sore
afflicted
and
determined
after
long
consideration
to
seek
to
learn
if
and
where
the
two
things
aforesaid
might
be
compassed
to
the
intent
that
she
might
in
consequence
have
her
husband
again
accordingly
having
bethought
herself
what
she
should
do
she
assembled
certain
of
the
best
and
chiefest
men
of
the
county
and
with
plaintive
speech
very
orderly
recounted
to
them
that
which
she
had
already
done
for
love
of
the
count
and
showed
them
what
had
ensued
thereof
adding
that
it
was
not
her
intent
that
through
her
sojourn
there
the
count
should
abide
in
perpetual
exile
nay
rather
she
purposed
to
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
in
pilgrimages
and
works
of
mercy
and
charity
for
her
health
wherefore
she
prayed
them
take
the
ward
and
governance
of
the
county
and
notify
the
count
that
she
had
left
him
free
and
vacant
possession
and
had
departed
the
country
intending
nevermore
to
return
to
roussillon
many
were
the
tears
shed
by
the
good
folk
whilst
she
spoke
and
many
the
prayers
addressed
to
her
that
it
would
please
her
change
counsel
and
abide
there
but
they
availed
nought
then
commending
them
to
god
she
set
out
upon
her
way
without
telling
any
whither
she
was
bound
well
furnished
with
monies
and
jewels
of
price
and
accompanied
by
a
cousin
of
hers
and
a
chamberwoman
all
in
pilgrims
habits
and
stayed
not
till
she
came
to
florence
where
chancing
upon
a
little
inn
kept
by
a
decent
widow
woman
she
there
took
up
her
abode
and
lived
quietly
after
the
fashion
of
a
poor
pilgrim
impatient
to
hear
news
of
her
lord
it
befell
then
that
on
the
morrow
of
her
arrival
she
saw
bertrand
pass
before
her
lodging
with
his
company
and
albeit
she
knew
him
full
well
natheless
she
asked
the
good
woman
of
the
inn
who
he
was
the
hostess
answered
is
a
stranger
gentleman
who
calleth
himself
count
bertrand
a
pleasant
man
and
a
courteous
and
much
loved
in
this
city
and
he
is
the
most
enamoured
man
in
the
world
of
a
of
ours
who
is
a
gentlewoman
but
poor
sooth
to
say
she
is
a
very
virtuous
damsel
and
abideth
being
yet
unmarried
for
poverty
with
her
mother
a
very
good
and
discreet
lady
but
for
whom
maybe
she
had
already
done
the
count
pleasure
the
countess
took
good
note
of
what
she
heard
and
having
more
closely
enquired
into
every
particular
and
apprehended
all
aright
determined
in
herself
how
she
should
do
accordingly
having
learned
the
house
and
name
of
the
lady
whose
daughter
the
count
loved
she
one
day
repaired
privily
thither
in
her
pilgrim
habit
and
finding
the
mother
and
daughter
in
very
poor
case
saluted
them
and
told
the
former
that
an
it
pleased
her
she
would
fain
speak
with
her
alone
the
gentlewoman
rising
replied
that
she
was
ready
to
hearken
to
her
and
accordingly
carried
her
into
a
chamber
of
hers
where
they
seated
themselves
and
the
countess
began
thus
meseemeth
you
are
of
the
enemies
of
fortune
even
as
i
am
but
an
you
will
belike
you
may
be
able
to
relieve
both
yourself
and
me
the
lady
answered
that
she
desired
nothing
better
than
to
relieve
herself
by
any
honest
means
and
the
countess
went
on
must
you
pledge
me
your
faith
whereto
an
i
commit
myself
and
you
deceive
me
you
will
mar
your
own
affairs
and
mine
me
anything
you
will
in
all
assurance
replied
the
gentlewoman
never
shall
you
find
yourself
deceived
of
me
thereupon
the
countess
beginning
with
her
first
enamourment
recounted
to
her
who
she
was
and
all
that
had
betided
her
to
that
day
after
such
a
fashion
that
the
gentlewoman
putting
faith
in
her
words
and
having
indeed
already
in
part
heard
her
story
from
others
began
to
have
compassion
of
her
the
countess
having
related
her
adventures
went
on
to
say
have
now
amongst
my
other
troubles
heard
what
are
the
two
things
which
it
behoveth
me
have
an
i
would
have
my
husband
and
to
which
i
know
none
who
can
help
me
save
only
yourself
if
that
be
true
which
i
hear
to
wit
that
the
count
my
husband
is
passionately
enamoured
of
your
daughter
answered
the
gentlewoman
the
count
love
my
daughter
i
know
not
indeed
he
maketh
a
great
show
thereof
but
an
it
be
so
what
can
i
do
in
this
that
you
desire
rejoined
the
countess
will
tell
you
but
first
i
will
show
you
what
i
purpose
shall
ensue
thereof
to
you
an
you
serve
me
i
see
your
daughter
fair
and
of
age
for
a
husband
and
according
to
what
i
have
heard
meseemeth
i
understand
the
lack
of
good
to
marry
her
withal
it
is
that
causeth
you
keep
her
at
home
now
i
purpose
in
requital
of
the
service
you
shall
do
me
to
give
her
forthright
of
mine
own
monies
such
a
dowry
as
you
yourself
shall
deem
necessary
to
marry
her
honorably
the
mother
being
needy
was
pleased
with
the
offer
algates
having
the
spirit
of
a
gentlewoman
she
said
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
if
it
consist
with
my
honour
i
will
willingly
do
it
and
you
shall
after
do
that
which
shall
please
you
then
said
the
countess
behoveth
me
that
you
let
tell
the
count
my
husband
by
some
one
in
whom
you
trust
that
your
daughter
is
ready
to
do
his
every
pleasure
so
she
may
but
be
certified
that
he
loveth
her
as
he
pretendeth
the
which
she
will
never
believe
except
he
send
her
the
ring
which
he
carrieth
on
his
finger
and
by
which
she
hath
heard
he
setteth
such
store
an
he
send
you
the
ring
you
must
give
it
to
me
and
after
send
to
him
to
say
that
your
daughter
is
ready
do
his
pleasure
then
bring
him
hither
in
secret
and
privily
put
me
to
bed
to
him
in
the
stead
of
your
daughter
it
may
be
god
will
vouchsafe
me
to
conceive
and
on
this
wise
having
his
ring
on
my
finger
and
a
child
in
mine
arms
of
him
begotten
i
shall
presently
regain
him
and
abide
with
him
as
a
wife
should
abide
with
her
husband
and
you
will
have
been
the
cause
thereof
this
seemed
a
grave
matter
to
the
gentlewoman
who
feared
lest
blame
should
haply
ensue
thereof
to
her
daughter
nevertheless
bethinking
her
it
were
honourably
done
to
help
the
poor
lady
recover
her
husband
and
that
she
went
about
to
do
this
to
a
worthy
end
and
trusting
in
the
good
and
honest
intention
of
the
countess
she
not
only
promised
her
to
do
it
but
before
many
days
dealing
with
prudence
and
secrecy
in
accordance
with
the
latter
instructions
she
both
got
the
ring
albeit
this
seemed
somewhat
grievous
to
the
count
and
adroitly
put
her
to
bed
with
her
husband
in
the
place
of
her
own
daughter
in
these
first
embracements
most
ardently
sought
of
the
count
the
lady
by
god
pleasure
became
with
child
of
two
sons
as
her
delivery
in
due
time
made
manifest
nor
once
only
but
many
times
did
the
gentlewoman
gratify
the
countess
with
her
husband
embraces
contriving
so
secretly
that
never
was
a
word
known
of
the
matter
whilst
the
count
still
believed
himself
to
have
been
not
with
his
wife
but
with
her
whom
he
loved
and
whenas
he
came
to
take
leave
of
a
morning
he
gave
her
at
one
time
and
another
divers
goodly
and
precious
jewels
which
the
countess
laid
up
with
all
diligence
then
feeling
herself
with
child
and
unwilling
to
burden
the
gentlewoman
farther
with
such
an
office
she
said
to
her
thanks
to
god
and
you
i
have
gotten
that
which
i
desired
wherefore
it
is
time
that
i
do
that
which
shall
content
you
and
after
get
me
gone
hence
the
gentlewoman
answered
that
if
she
had
gotten
that
which
contented
her
she
was
well
pleased
but
that
she
had
not
done
this
of
any
hope
of
reward
nay
for
that
herseemed
it
behoved
her
to
do
it
an
she
would
do
well
rejoined
the
countess
which
you
say
liketh
me
well
and
so
on
my
part
i
purpose
not
to
give
you
that
which
you
shall
ask
of
me
by
way
of
reward
but
to
do
well
for
that
meseemeth
behoveful
so
to
do
the
gentlewoman
then
constrained
by
necessity
with
the
utmost
shamefastness
asked
her
an
hundred
pounds
to
marry
her
daughter
withal
but
the
countess
seeing
her
confusion
and
hearing
her
modest
demand
gave
her
five
hundred
and
so
many
rare
and
precious
jewels
as
were
worth
maybe
as
much
more
with
this
the
gentlewoman
was
far
more
than
satisfied
and
rendered
the
countess
the
best
thanks
in
her
power
whereupon
the
latter
taking
leave
of
her
returned
to
the
inn
whilst
the
other
to
deprive
bertrand
of
all
farther
occasion
of
coming
or
sending
to
her
house
removed
with
her
daughter
into
the
country
to
the
house
of
one
of
her
kinsfolk
and
he
being
a
little
after
recalled
by
his
vassals
and
hearing
that
the
countess
had
departed
the
country
returned
to
his
own
house
the
countess
hearing
that
he
had
departed
florence
and
returned
to
his
county
was
mightily
rejoiced
and
abode
at
florence
till
her
time
came
to
be
delivered
when
she
gave
birth
to
two
male
children
most
like
their
father
and
let
rear
them
with
all
diligence
whenas
it
seemed
to
her
time
she
set
out
and
came
without
being
known
of
any
to
montpellier
where
having
rested
some
days
and
made
enquiry
of
the
count
and
where
he
was
she
learned
that
he
was
to
hold
a
great
entertainment
of
knights
and
ladies
at
roussillon
on
all
saints
day
and
betook
herself
thither
still
in
her
pilgrim
habit
that
she
was
wont
to
wear
finding
the
knights
and
ladies
assembled
in
the
palace
and
about
to
sit
down
to
table
she
went
up
with
her
children
in
her
arms
and
without
changing
her
dress
into
the
banqueting
hall
and
making
her
way
between
man
and
man
whereas
she
saw
the
count
cast
herself
at
his
feet
and
said
weeping
am
thine
unhappy
wife
who
to
let
thee
return
and
abide
in
thy
house
have
long
gone
wandering
miserably
about
the
world
i
conjure
thee
in
the
name
of
god
to
accomplish
unto
me
thy
promise
upon
the
condition
appointed
me
by
the
two
knights
i
sent
thee
for
behold
here
in
mine
arms
is
not
only
one
son
of
thine
but
two
and
here
is
thy
ring
it
is
time
then
that
i
be
received
of
thee
as
a
wife
according
to
thy
promise
the
count
hearing
this
was
all
confounded
and
recognized
the
ring
and
the
children
also
so
like
were
they
to
him
but
yet
he
said
can
this
have
come
to
pass
the
countess
then
to
his
exceeding
wonderment
and
that
of
all
others
who
were
present
orderly
recounted
that
which
had
passed
and
how
it
had
happened
whereupon
the
count
feeling
that
she
spoke
sooth
and
seeing
her
constancy
and
wit
and
moreover
two
such
goodly
children
as
well
for
the
observance
of
his
promise
as
to
pleasure
all
his
liegemen
and
the
ladies
who
all
besought
him
thenceforth
to
receive
and
honour
her
as
his
lawful
wife
put
off
his
obstinate
despite
and
raising
the
countess
to
her
feet
embraced
her
and
kissing
her
acknowledged
her
for
his
lawful
wife
and
those
for
his
children
then
letting
clothe
her
in
apparel
such
as
beseemed
her
quality
to
the
exceeding
joyance
of
as
many
as
were
there
and
of
all
other

vassals
who
heard
the
news
he
held
high
festival
not
only
all
that
day
but
sundry
others
and
from
that
day
forth
still

in
the
town
mightily
extol
the
christian
faith
and
the
service
of
god
one
day
questioned
one
of
them
in
what
manner
one
might
avail
to
serve
god
with
the
least
hindrance
the
other
answered
that
they
best
served
god
who
most
strictly
eschewed
the
things
of
the
world
as
those
did
who
had
betaken
them
into
the
solitudes
of
the
deserts
of
thebais
the
girl
who
was
maybe
fourteen
years
old
and
very
simple
moved
by
no
ordered
desire
but
by
some
childish
fancy
set
off
next
morning
by
stealth
and
all
alone
to
go
to
the
desert
of
thebais
without
letting
any
know
her
intent
after
some
days
her
desire
persisting
she
won
with
no
little
toil
to
the
deserts
in
question
and
seeing
a
hut
afar
off
went
thither
and
found
at
the
door
a
holy
man
who
marvelled
to
see
her
there
and
asked
her
what
she
sought
she
replied
that
being
inspired
of
god
she
went
seeking
to
enter
into
his
service
and
was
now
in
quest
of
one
who
should
teach
her
how
it
behoved
to
serve
him
the
worthy
man
seeing
her
young
and
very
fair
and
fearing
lest
an
he
entertained
her
the
devil
should
beguile
him
commended
her
pious
intent
and
giving
her
somewhat
to
eat
of
roots
of
herbs
and
wild
apples
and
dates
and
to
drink
of
water
said
to
her
mine
not
far
hence
is
a
holy
man
who
is
a
much
better
master
than
i
of
that
which
thou
goest
seeking
do
thou
betake
thyself
to
him
and
put
her
in
the
way
however
when
she
reached
the
man
in
question
she
had
of
him
the
same
answer
and
faring
farther
came
to
the
cell
of
a
young
hermit
a
very
devout
and
good
man
whose
name
was
rustico
and
to
whom
she
made
the
same
request
as
she
had
done
to
the
others
he
having
a
mind
to
make
a
trial
of
his
own
constancy
sent
her
not
away
as
the
others
had
done
but
received
her
into
his
cell
and
the
night
being
come
he
made
her
a
little
bed
of
and
bade
her
lie
down
to
rest
thereon
this
done
temptations
tarried
not
to
give
battle
to
his
powers
of
resistance
and
he
finding
himself
grossly
deceived
by
these
latter
turned
tail
without
awaiting
many
assaults
and
confessed
himself
beaten
then
laying
aside
devout
thoughts
and
orisons
and
mortifications
he
fell
to
revolving
in
his
memory
the
youth
and
beauty
of
the
damsel
and
bethinking
himself
what
course
he
should
take
with
her
so
as
to
win
to
that
which
he
desired
of
her
without
her
taking
him
for
a
debauched
fellow
accordingly
having
sounded
her
with
sundry
questions
he
found
that
she
had
never
known
man
and
was
in
truth
as
simple
as
she
seemed
wherefore
he
bethought
him
how
under
colour
of
the
service
of
god
he
might
bring
her
to
his
pleasures
in
the
first
place
he
showeth
her
with
many
words
how
great
an
enemy
the
devil
was
of
god
the
lord
and
after
gave
her
to
understand
that
the
most
acceptable
service
that
could
be
rendered
to
god
was
to
put
back
the
devil
into
hell
whereto
he
had
condemned
him
the
girl
asked
him
how
this
might
be
done
and
he
shalt
soon
know
that
do
thou
but
as
thou
shalt
see
me
do
so
saying
he
proceeded
to
put
off
the
few
garments
he
had
and
abode
stark
naked
as
likewise
did
the
girl
whereupon
he
fell
on
his
knees
as
he
would
pray
and
caused
her
abide
over
against
himself
footnote
the
translators
regret
that
the
disuse
into
which
magic
has
fallen
makes
it
impossible
to

technicalities

mysterious
art

passage

from

no
whereupon
rustico
seeing
her
so
fair
felt
an
accession
of
desire
and
therewith
came
an
insurgence
of
the
flesh
which
alibech
marking
with
surprise
said
rustico
what
is
this
which
i
see
thee
have
that
so
protrudes
and
which
i
have
not
oh
my
daughter
said
rustico
is
the
devil
of
whom
i
have
told
thee
and
seest
thou
he
is
now
tormenting
me
most
grievously
insomuch
that
i
am
scarce
able
to
hold
out
then
praise
be
to
god
said
the
girl
i
see
that
i
am
in
better
case
than
thou
for
no
such
devil
have
i
sooth
sayst
thou
returned
rustico
but
instead
of
him
thou
hast
somewhat
else
that
i
have
not
oh
said
alibech
what
may
that
be
hell
answered
rustico
and
i
tell
thee
that
is
my
belief
that
god
has
sent
thee
hither
for
the
salvation
of
my
soul
seeing
that
if
this
devil
shall
continue
to
plague
me
thus
then
so
thou
wilt
have
compassion
on
me
and
permit
me
to
put
him
in
hell
thou
wilt
both
afford
me
great
and
exceeding
great
solace
and
render
to
god
an
exceeding
most
acceptable
service
if
as
thou
sayst
thou
art
come
into
these
parts
for
such
a
purpose
in
good
faith
the
girl
made
answer
as
i
have
hell
to
match
your
devil
be
it
my
father
as
and
when
you
will
whereupon
bless
thee
my
daughter
said
rustico
go
we
then
and
put
him
there
that
he
leave
me
henceforth
in
peace
which
said
he
took
the
girl
to
one
of
the
beds
and
taught
her
the
posture
in
which
she
must
lie
in
order
to
incarcerate
this
spirit
accursed
of
god
the
girl
having
never
before
put
any
devil
in
hell
felt
on
this
first
occasion
a
twinge
of
pain
wherefore
she
said
to
rustico
of
a
surety
my
father
he
must
be
a
wicked
fellow
this
devil
and
in
very
truth
a
foe
to
god
for
there
is
sorrow
even
in
hell
not
to
speak
of
other
places
when
he
is
put
there
daughter
said
rustico
not
be
always
so
and
for
better
assurance
thereof
they
put
him
there
six
times
before
they
quitted
the
bed
whereby
they
so
thoroughly
abased
his
pride
that
he
was
fain
to
be
quiet
however
the
proud
fit
returning
upon
him
from
time
to
time
and
the
girl
addressing
herself
always
obediently
to
its
reduction
it
so
befell
that
she
began
to
find
the
game
agreeable
and
would
say
to
rustico
now
see
i
plainly
that
was
true
what
the
worthy
men
said
at
capsa
of
the
service
of
god
being
so
delightful
indeed
i
can
not
remember
that
in
aught
that
ever
i
did
i
had
so
much
pleasure
so
much
solace
as
in
putting
the
devil
in
hell
for
which
cause
i
deem
it
insensate
folly
on
the
part
of
any
one
to
have
a
care
to
aught
else
than
the
service
of
god
wherefore
many
a
time
she
would
come
to
rustico
and
say
to
him
my
father
was
to
serve
god
that
i
came
hither
and
not
to
pass
my
days
in
idleness
go
we
then
and
put
the
devil
in
hell
and
while
they
did
so
she
would
now
and
again
say
i
know
not
rustico
why
the
devil
should
escape
from
hell
were
he
but
as
ready
to
stay
there
as
hell
is
to
receive
and
retain
him
he
would
never
come
out
of
it
so
the
girl
thus
frequently
inviting
and
exhorting
rustico
to
the
service
of
god
there
came
at
length
a
time
when
she
had
so
thoroughly
lightened
his
doublet
that
he
shivered
when
another
would
have
sweated
wherefore
he
began
to
instruct
her
that
the
devil
was
not
to
be
corrected
and
put
in
hell
save
when
his
head
was
exalted
with
pride
adding
and
we
by
god
grace
have
brought
him
to
so
sober
a
mind
that
he
prays
god
he
may
be
left
in
peace
by
which
means
he
for
a
time
kept
the
girl
quiet
but
when
she
saw
that
rustico
had
no
more
occasion
for
her
to
put
the
devil
in
hell
she
said
to
him
one
day
rustico
if
thy
devil
is
chastened
and
gives
thee
no
more
trouble
my
hell
on
the
other
hand
gives
me
no
peace
wherefore
i
with
my
hell
have
holpen
thee
to
abase
the
pride
of
thy
devil
so
thou
wouldst
do
well
to
lend
me
the
aid
of
thy
devil
to
allay
the
fervent
heat
of
my
hell
rustico
who
lived
on
roots
and
water
could
ill
avail
to
answer
her
calls
and
told
her
that
it
would
need
overmany
devils
to
appease
hell
but
he
would
do
what
he
might
thereof
accordingly
he
satisfied
her
bytimes
but
so
seldom
it
was
but
casting
a
bean
into
the
mouth
whereas
the
girl
herseeming
she
served
not
god
as
diligently
as
she
would
fain
have
done
murmured
somewhat
but
whilst
this
debate
was
toward
between
rustico
his
devil
and
alibech
her
hell
for
overmuch
desire
on
the
one
part
and
lack
of
power
on
the
other
it
befell
that
a
fire
broke
out
in
capsa
and
burnt
alibech
father
in
his
own
house
with
as
many
children
and
other
family
as
he
had
by
reason
whereof
she
abode
heir
to
all
his
good
thereupon
a
young
man
called
neerbale
who
had
spent
all
his
substance
in
gallantry
hearing
that
she
was
alive
set
out
in
search
of
her
and
finding
her
before
the
court
had
laid
hands
upon
her
father
estate
as
that
of
a
man
dying
without
heir
to
rustico
great
satisfaction
but
against
her
own
will
brought
her
back
to
capsa
where
he
took
her
to
wife
and
succeeded
in
her
right
to
the
ample
inheritance
of
her
father
footnote
the
government
there
being
asked
by
the
women
at
what
she
served
god
in
the
desert
she
answered
neerbale
having
not
yet
lain
with
her
that
she
served
him
at
putting
the
devil
in
hell
and
that
neerbale
had
done
a
grievous
sin
in
that
he
had
taken
her
from
such
service
the
ladies
asked
putteth
one
the
devil
in
hell
and
the
girl
what
with
words
and
what
with
gestures
expounded
it
to
them
whereat
they
set
up
so
great
a
laughing
that
they
laugh
yet
and
said
yourself
no
concern
my
child
nay
for
that
is
done
here
also
and
neerbale
will
serve
our
lord
full
well
with
thee
at
this
thereafter
telling
it
from
one
to
another
throughout
the
city
they
brought
it
to
a
common
saying
there
that
the
most
acceptable
service
one
could
render
to
god
was
to
put
the
devil
in
hell
which
byword
having
passed
the
sea
hither
is
yet
current
here
wherefore
do
all
you
young
ladies
who
have
need
of
god
grace
learn
to
put
the
devil
in
hell
for
that
this
is
highly
acceptable
to
him
and
pleasing
to
both
parties
and
much
good
may
grow
and
ensue
thereof
a
thousand
times
or

moved
the
modest
ladies
to

quaint

his
words
appear

them

he
had
made
an
end
thereof
the
queen
knowing
the
term
of
her
sovranty

lifted
the

from
her

appear

i
not

escape
being
cruelly
shaken

well
nigh
uprooted
of
the
aforesaid
wind
and
all
torn
of
the
fangs
of
envy
wherefore
i
can
very
manifestly
understand
that
to
be
true
which
the
wise
use
to
say
to

that
misery
alone
in

that

i
should
take

much

footnote

but
ere

come

to
any
of

it
pleaseth
me
in
mine
own
defence
to
relate
not
an
entire
story
lest
it
should
seem
i
would
fain
mingle
mine
own
stories
with
those
of
so
commendable
a
company
as
that
which
i
have
presented
to
you
but
a
part
of
one
that
so
its
very
default
of
completeness
may
attest
that
it
is
none
of
those
and
accordingly
speaking
to
my
assailants
i
say
that
in
our
city
a
good
while
agone
there
was
a
townsman
by
name
filippo
balducci
a
man
of
mean
enough
extraction
but
rich
and
well
addressed
and
versed
in
such
matters
as
his
condition
comported
he
had
a
wife
whom
he
loved
with
an
exceeding
love
as
she
him
and
they
lived
a
peaceful
life
together
studying
nothing
so
much
as
wholly
to
please
one
another
in
course
of
time
it
came
to
pass
as
it
cometh
to
pass
of
all
that
the
good
lady
departed
this
life
and
left
filippo
nought
of
herself
but
one
only
son
begotten
of
him
and
maybe
two
years
old
filippo
for
the
death
of
his
lady
abode
as
disconsolate
as
ever
man
might
having
lost
a
beloved
one
and
seeing
himself
left
alone
and
forlorn
of
that
company
which
most
he
loved
he
resolved
to
be
no
more
of
the
world
but
to
give
himself
altogether
to
the
service
of
god
and
do
the
like
with
his
little
son
wherefore
bestowing
all
his
good
for
the
love
of
god
he
repaired
without
delay
to
the
top
of
mount
asinajo
where
he
took
up
his
abode
with
his
son
in
a
little
hut
and
there
living
with
him
upon
alms
in
the
practice
of
fasts
and
prayers
straitly
guarded
himself
from
discoursing
whereas
the
boy
was
of
any
temporal
thing
neither
suffered
him
see
aught
thereof
lest
this
should
divert
him
from
the
service
aforesaid
but
still
bespoke
him
of
the
glories
of
life
eternal
and
of
god
and
the
saints
teaching
him
nought
but
pious
orisons
and
in
this
way
of
life
he
kept
him
many
years
never
suffering
him
go
forth
of
the
hermitage
nor
showing
him
aught
other
than
himself
footnote
in
alms
now
the
good
man
was
used
to
come
whiles
into
florence
where
being
succoured
according
to
his
occasions
of
the
friends
of
god
he
returned
to
his
hut
and
it
chanced
one
day
that
his
son
being
now
eighteen
years
old
and
filippo
an
old
man
the
lad
asked
him
whither
he
went
filippo
told
him
and
the
boy
said
father
mine
you
are
now
an
old
man
and
can
ill
endure
fatigue
why
do
you
not
whiles
carry
me
to
florence
and
bring
me
to
know
the
friends
and
devotees
of
god
and
yourself
to
the
end
that
i
who
am
young
and
better
able
to
toil
than
you
may
after
whenas
it
pleaseth
you
go
to
florence
for
our
occasions
whilst
you
abide
here
the
worthy
man
considering
that
his
son
was
now
grown
to
man
estate
and
thinking
him
so
inured
to
the
service
of
god
that
the
things
of
this
world
might
thenceforth
uneath
allure
him
to
themselves
said
in
himself
the
lad
saith
well
and
accordingly
having
occasion
to
go
thither
he
carried
him
with
him
there
the
youth
seeing
the
palaces
the
houses
the
churches
and
all
the
other
things
whereof
one
seeth
all
the
city
full
began
as
one
who
had
never
to
his
recollection
beheld
the
like
to
marvel
amain
and
questioned
his
father
of
many
things
what
they
were
and
how
they
were
called
filippo
told
him
and
he
hearing
him
abode
content
and
questioned
of
somewhat
else
as
they
went
thus
the
son
asking
and
the
father
answering
they
encountered
by
chance
a
company
of
pretty
and
young
women
coming
from
a
wedding
whom
as
soon
as
the
young
man
saw
he
asked
his
father
what
manner
of
things
these
were
my
son
answered
filippo
cast
your
eyes
on
the
ground
and
look
not
at
them
for
that
they
are
an
ill
thing
quoth
the
son
and
how
are
they
called
the
father
not
to
awaken
in
the
lad
mind
a
carnal
appetite
less
than
useful
would
not
name
them
by
the
proper
name
to
wit
women
but
said
they
are
called
green
geese
whereupon
marvellous
to
relate
he
who
have
never
seen
a
woman
and
who
recked
not
of
palaces
nor
oxen
nor
horses
nor
asses
nor
monies
nor
of
aught
else
he
had
seen
said
suddenly
father
mine
i
prithee
get
me
one
of
these
green
geese
alack
my
son
replied
the
father
hold
they
peace
i
tell
thee
they
are
an
ill
thing
how
asked
the
youth
are
ill
things
then
made
after
this
fashion
and
filippo
answered
ay
then
said
the
son
i
know
not
what
you
would
say
nor
why
these
are
an
ill
thing
for
my
part
meseemeth
i
never
yet
saw
aught
goodly
or
pleasing
as
are
these
they
are
fairer
than
the
painted
angels
you
have
shown
me
whiles
for
god
sake
an
you
reck
of
me
contrive
that
we
may
carry
one
of
yonder
green
geese
back
with
us
up
yonder
and
i
will
give
it
to
eat
nay
answered
the
father
i
will
not
thou
knowest
not
whereon
they
feed
and
he
understood
incontinent
that
nature
was
stronger
than
his
wit
and
repented
him
of
having
brought
the
youth
to
florence
but
i
will
have
it
suffice
me
to
have
told
this
much
of
the
present
story
and
return
to
those
for
whose
behoof
i
have
related
it
some
then
of
my
censurers
say
that
i
do
ill
young
ladies
in
studying
overmuch
to
please
you
and
that
you
please
me
overmuch
which
things
i
do
most
openly
confess
to
wit
that
you
please
me
and
that
i
study
to
please
you
and
i
ask
them
if
they
marvel
thereat
considering
let
be
the
having
known
the
dulcet
kisses
and
amorous
embracements
and
delightsome
couplings
that
are
of
you
most
sweet
ladies
often
gotten
only
my
having
seen
and
still
seeing
your
dainty
manners
and
lovesome
beauty
and
sprightly
grace
and
above
all
your
womanly
courtesy
whenas
he
who
had
been
reared
and
bred
on
a
wild
and
solitary
mountain
and
within
the
bounds
of
a
little
cell
without
other
company
than
his
father
no
sooner
set
eyes
on
you
than
you
alone
were
desired
of
him
you
alone
sought
you
alone
followed
with
the
eagerness
of
passion
will
they
then
blame
me
back
bite
me
rend
me
with
their
tongues
if
i
whose
body
heaven
created
all
apt
to
love
you
i
who
from
my
childhood
vowed
my
soul
to
you
feeling
the
potency
of
the
light
of
your
eyes
and
the
sweetness
of
your
honeyed
words
and
the
flame
enkindled
by
your
piteous
sighs
if
i
say
you
please
me
or
if
i
study
to
please
you
seeing
that
you
over
all
else
pleased
a
hermitling
a
lad
without
understanding
nay
rather
a
wild
animal
certes
it
is
only
those
who
having
neither
sense
nor
cognizance
of
the
pleasures
and
potency
of
natural
affection
love
you
not
nor
desire
to
be
loved
of
you
that
chide
me
thus
and
of
these
i
reck
little
as
for
those
who
go
railing
anent
mine
age
it
would
seem
they
know
ill
that
for
all
the
leek
hath
a
white
head
the
tail
thereof
is
green
but
to
these
laying
aside
pleasantry
i
answer
that
never
no
not
to
the
extreme
limit
of
my
life
shall
i
repute
it
to
myself
for
shame
to
seek
to
please
those
whom
guido
cavalcanti
and
dante
alighieri
when
already
stricken
in
years
and
messer
cino
da
pistoja
when
a
very
old
man
held
in
honour
and
whose
approof
was
dear
to
them
and
were
it
not
to
depart
from
the
wonted
usance
of
discourse
i
would
cite
history
in
support
and
show
it
to
be
all
full
of
stories
of
ancient
and
noble
men
who
in
their
ripest
years
have
still
above
all
studied
to
please
the
ladies
the
which
an
they
know
not
let
them
go
learn
that
i
should
abide
with
the
muses
on
parnassus
i
confess
to
be
good
counsel
but
since
we
can
neither
abide
for
ever
with
the
muses
nor
they
with
us
it
is
nothing
blameworthy
if
whenas
it
chanceth
a
man
is
parted
from
them
he
take
delight
in
seeing
that
which
is
like
unto
them
the
muses
are
women
and
albeit
women
may
not
avail
to
match
with
them
yet
at
first
sight
they
have
a
semblance
of
them
insomuch
that
an
they
pleased
me
not
for
aught
else
for
this
they
should
please
me
more
by
token
that
women
have
aforetime
been
to
me
the
occasion
of
composing
a
thousand
verses
whereas
the
muses
never
were
to
me
the
occasion
of
making
any
they
aided
me
indeed
and
showed
me
how
to
compose
the
verses
in
question
and
peradventure
in
the
writing
of
these
present
things
all
lowly
though
they
be
they
have
come
whiles
to
abide
with
me
in
token
maybe
and
honour
of
the
likeness
that
women
bear
to
them
wherefore
in
inditing
these
toys
i
stray
not
so
far
from
mount
parnassus
nor
from
the
muses
as
many
belike
conceive
but
what
shall
we
say
to
those
who
have
such
compassion
on
my
hunger
that
they
counsel
me
provide
myself
bread
certes
i
know
not
save
that
whenas
i
seek
to
imagine
in
myself
what
would
be
their
answer
an
i
should
of
necessity
beseech
them
thereof
to
wit
of
bread
methinketh
they
would
reply
go
seek
it
among
thy
fables
indeed
aforetime
poets
have
found
more
thereof
among
their
fables
than
many
a
rich
man
among
his
treasures
and
many
following
after
their
fables
have
caused
their
age
to
flourish
whereas
on
the
contrary
many
in
seeking
to
have
more
bread
than
they
needed
have
perished
miserably
what
more
shall
i
say
let
them
drive
me
forth
whenas
i
ask
it
of
them
not
that
godamercy
i
have
yet
need
thereof
and
even
should
need
betide
i
know
with
the
apostle
paul
both
how
to
abound
and
suffer
need
wherefore
let
none
be
more
careful
of
me
than
i
am
of
myself
for
those
who
say
that
these
things
have
not
been
such
as
i
have
here
set
them
down
i
would
fain
have
them
produce
the
originals
and
an
these
latter
accord
not
with
that
of
which
i
write
i
will
confess
their
objection
for
just
and
will
study
to
amend
myself
but
till
otherwhat
than
words
appeareth
i
will
leave
them
to
their
opinion
and
follow
mine
own
saying
of
them
that
which
they
say
of
me
footnote
i
know
both
how
to
be
abased
and
i
know
how
to
abound
everywhere
and
in
all
things
i
am
instructed
both
to
be
full
and
to
be
hungry
both
to
abound
and
suffer
need
iv
wherefore
deeming
that
for
the
nonce
i
have
answered
enough
i
say
that
armed
as
i
hope
to
be
with
god
aid
and
yours
gentlest
ladies
and
with
fair
patience
i
will
fare
on
with
this
that
i
have
begun
turning
my
back
to
the
wind
aforesaid
and
letting
it
blow
for
that
i
see
not
that
aught

an
and
a
worthy
of

tancred
lord
of
salerno
was
a
humane
prince
and
benign
enough
of
nature
had
he
not
in
his
old
age
imbrued
his
hands
in
blood
who
in
all
the
course
of
his
life
had
but
one
daughter
and
happier
had
he
been
if
he
had
none
she
was
of
him
as
tenderly
loved
as
ever
daughter
of
father
and
knowing
not
by
reason
of
this
his
tender
love
for
her
how
to
part
with
her
he
married
her
not
till
she
had
long
overpassed
the
age
when
she
should
have
had
a
husband
at
last
he
gave
her
to
wife
to
a
son
of
the
duke
of
capua
with
whom
having
abidden
a
little
while
she
was
left
a
widow
and
returned
to
her
father
now
she
was
most
fair
of
form
and
favour
as
ever
was
woman
and
young
and
sprightly
and
learned
perchance
more
than
is
required
of
a
lady
abiding
then
with
her
father
in
all
ease
and
luxury
like
a
great
lady
as
she
was
and
seeing
that
for
the
love
he
bore
her
he
recked
little
of
marrying
her
again
nor
did
it
seem
to
her
a
seemly
thing
to
require
him
thereof
she
bethought
herself
to
seek
an
it
might
be
to
get
her
privily
a
worthy
lover
she
saw
men
galore
gentle
and
simple
frequent
her
father
court
and
considering
the
manners
and
fashions
of
many
a
young
of
her
father
guiscardo
by

a
man
of
humble
enough
extraction
but
nobler
of
worth
and
manners
than
whatsoever
other
pleased
her
over
all
and
of
him
seeing
him
often
she
became
in
secret
ardently
enamoured
approving
more
and
more
his
fashions
every
hour
whilst
the
young
man
who
was
no
dullard
perceiving
her
liking
for
him
received
her
into
his
heart
on
such
wise
that
his
mind
was
thereby
diverted
from
well
nigh
everything
other
than
the
love
of
her
each
then
thus
secretly
tendering
the
other
the
young
lady
who
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
foregather
with
him
but
had
no
mind
to
make
any
one
a
confidant
of
her
passion
bethought
herself
of
a
rare
device
to
apprize
him
of
the
means
to
wit
she
wrote
him
a
letter
wherein
she
showed
him
how
he
should
do
to
foregather
with
her
on
the
ensuing
day
and
placing
it
in
the
hollow
of
a
cane
gave
the
letter
jestingly
to
guiscardo
saying
thee
a
bellows
thereof
for
thy
wherewith
she
may
blow

guiscardo
took
the
cane
and
bethinking
himself
that
she
would
not
have
given
it
him
nor
spoken
thus
without
some
cause
took
his
leave
and
returned
therewith
to
his
lodging
there
he
examined
the
cane
and
seeing
it
to
be
cleft
opened
it
and
found
therein
the
letter
which
having
read
and
well
apprehended
that
which
he
had
to
do
he
was
the
joyfullest
man
alive

set
about
taking
order

he
might
go

to
the
fashion
appointed

was
beside

grotto
hewn
out
of

rock

made
in

long
agone

to
this
grotto
some
little
light
was
given
by
a
tunnel
by
art
wrought
in
the
mountain
which
latter
for
that
the
grotto
was
abandoned
was

nigh
blocked
at
its
mouth

love

recalled
it
to
the
memory

the
enamoured

laboured
sore

grotto

seeing
the
tunnel
she
sent
to
bid
guiscardo
study
to
come
to
her
thereby

acquainted
him

should
be

end

promptly
made
ready
a
rope
with
certain
knots
and
loops
whereby
he
might
avail
to
descend
and
ascend
and
donning
a
leathern
suit
that
might
defend
him
from
the
briers
he
on
the
ensuing
night
repaired
without
letting

know
aught

tunnel
there
making
one
end
of
the
rope
fast
to
a
stout
that
had
grown
up
in
the
mouth
he
let
himself
down
thereby
into
the
grotto
and
there
awaited
the
lady
who
on
the
morrow
feigning
a
desire
to
sleep
dismissed
her
women
and
shut
herself
up
alone
in
her
chamber
then
opening
the
privy
door
she
descended
into
the
grotto
where
she
found
guiscardo

greeted
one
another
with
marvellous
joy
and
betook
themselves
to
her
chamber

they
abode
great
part
of
the
day
in

utmost
delight

had
taken
order
together

the
discreet
conduct

guiscardo
returned
to
the
grotto
whilst
she
shut
the
privy
door
and
went
forth
to
her
women

night

guiscardo
climbed
up
by
his
rope
to
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
and
issuing
forth
whence
he
had
entered

returned
to
his

returned
many
times
thereafter

fortune
jealous
of
so
long
and
so
great
a
delight
with
a
woeful
chance
changed
the
gladness
of
the
two
lovers
into
mourning
and
sorrow

wont
to
come
bytimes
all
alone
into
his
daughter
chamber
and
there
abide
with
her
and
converse
awhile
and
after
go
away
accordingly
one
day
after
dinner
he
came
thither
what
time
the
lady
whose
name
was
ghismonda
was
in
a
garden
of
hers
with
all
her
women
and
willing
not
to
take
her
from
her
diversion
he
entered
her
chamber
without
being
seen
or
heard
of
any
finding
the
windows
closed
and
the
curtains
let
down
over
the
bed
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
on
a
hassock
at
the
bedfoot
and
leant
his
head
against
the
bed
then
drawing
the
curtain
over
himself
as
if
he
had
studied
to
hide
himself
there
he
fell
asleep

slept

as
ill
chance
would
have

lover
to
come
thither

day
softly
entered
the
chamber
leaving
her
women
in
the
garden
and
having
shut
herself
in
without
perceiving
that
there
was
some
one
there
opened
the
secret
door
to
guiscardo
who
awaited
her
they
straightway
betook
themselves
to
bed
as
of
their
wont
and
what
while
they
sported
and
solaced
themselves
together
it
befell

awoke

heard
and
saw
that
which
guiscardo
and
his
daughter
did
whereat
beyond
measure
grieved

would
have
cried
out
at
them

bethought
himself
to
keep
silence

abide

with
more
secrecy
and
less
shame
to
himself
he
might
avail
to
do
that
which
had
already
occurred
to
his
mind
the
two
lovers
abode
a
great
while
together
according
to
their
usance
without
observing
tancred
and
coming
down
from
the
bed
whenas
it
seemed
to
them
time
guiscardo
returned
to
the
grotto
and
she
departed
the
chamber
whereupon
tancred
for
all
he
was
an
old
man
let
himself
down
into
the
garden
by
a
window
and
returned
unseen
of
any
to
his
own
chamber
sorrowful
unto
death
that
same
night
at
the
time
of
the
first
sleep
guiscardo
by
his
orders
was
seized
by
two
men
as
he
came
forth
of
the
tunnel
and
carried
secretly
trussed
as
he
was
in
his
suit
of
leather
to
tancred
who
whenas
he
saw
him
said
well
nigh
weeping
my
kindness
to
thee
merited
not
the
outrage
and
the
shame
thou
hast
done
me
in
mine
own
flesh
and
blood
as
i
have
this
day
seen
with
my
very
eyes
whereto
guiscardo
answered
nothing
but
this
can
far
more
than
either
you
or
i
tancred
then
commanded
that
he
should
be
kept
secretly
under
guard
and
in
one
of
the
chambers
of
the
palace
and
so
was
it
done
on
the
morrow
having
meanwhile
revolved
in
himself
many
and
divers
devices
he
betook
himself
after
eating
as
of
his
wont
to
his
daughter
chamber
and
sending
for
the
lady
who
as
yet
knew
nothing
of
these
things
shut
himself
up
with
her
and
proceeded
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
bespeak
her
thus
meseemed
i
knew
thy
virtue
and
thine
honesty
nor
might
it
ever
have
occurred
to
my
mind
though
it
were
told
me
had
i
not
seen
it
with
mine
own
eyes
that
thou
wouldst
even
so
much
as
in
thought
have
abandoned
thyself
to
any
man
except
he
were
thy
husband
wherefore
in
this
scant
remnant
of
life
that
my
eld
reserveth
unto
me
i
shall
still
abide
sorrowful
remembering
me
of
this
would
god
an
thou
must
needs
stoop
to
such
wantonness
thou
hadst
taken
a
man
sortable
to
thy
quality
but
amongst
so
many
who
frequent
my
court
thou
hast
chosen
guiscardo
a
youth
of
the
meanest
condition
reared
in
our
court
well
nigh
of
charity
from
a
little
child
up
to
this
day
wherefore
thou
hast
put
me
in
sore
travail
of
mind
for
that
i
know
not
what
course
to
take
with
thee
with
guiscardo
whom
i
caused
take
yesternight
as
he
issued
forth
of
the
tunnel
and
have
in
ward
i
am
already
resolved
how
to
deal
but
with
thee
god
knoweth
i
know
not
what
to
do
on
one
side
love
draweth
me
which
i
still
borne
thee
more
than
father
ever
bore
daughter
and
on
the
other
most
just
despite
conceived
for
thine
exceeding
folly
the
one
would
have
me
pardon
thee
the
other
would
have
me
against
my
nature
deal
harshly
by
thee
but
ere
i
come
to
a
decision
i
would
fain
hear
what
thou
hast
to
say
to
this
so
saying
he
bowed
his
head
and
wept
sore
as
would
a
beaten
child
ghismonda
hearing
her
father
words
and
seeing
that
not
only
was
her
secret
love
discovered
but
guiscardo
taken
felt
an
inexpressible
chagrin
and
came
many
a
time
near
upon
showing
it
with
outcry
and
tears
as
women
mostly
do
nevertheless
her
haughty
soul
overmastering
that
weakness
with
marvellous
fortitude
she
composed
her
countenance
and
rather
than
proffer
any
prayer
for
herself
determined
inwardly
to
abide
no
more
on
life
doubting
not
but
her
guiscardo
was
already
dead
wherefore
not
as
a
woman
rebuked
and
woeful
for
her
default
but
as
one
undaunted
and
valiant
with
dry
eyes
and
face
open
and
nowise
troubled
she
thus
bespoke
her
father
i
purpose
neither
to
deny
nor
to
entreat
for
that
the
one
would
profit
me
nothing
nor
would
i
have
the
other
avail
me
more
by
token
that
i
am
nowise
minded
to
seek
to
render
thy
mansuetude
and
thine
affection
favourable
to
me
but
rather
confessing
the
truth
first
with
true
arguments
to
vindicate
mine
honour
and
after
with
deeds
right
resolutely
to
ensue
the
greatness
of
my
soul
true
is
it
i
have
loved
and
love
guiscardo
and
what
while
i
live
which
will
be
little
i
shall
love
him
nor
if
folk
live
after
death
shall
i
ever
leave
loving
him
but
unto
this
it
was
not
so
much
my
feminine
frailty
that
moved
me
as
thy
little
solicitude
to
remarry
me
and
his
own
worth
it
should
have
been
manifest
to
thee
tancred
being
as
thou
art
flesh
and
blood
that
thou
hadst
begotten
a
daughter
of
flesh
and
blood
and
not
of
iron
or
stone
and
thou
shouldst
have
remembered
and
should
still
remember
for
all
thou
art
old
what
and
what
like
are
the
laws
of
youth
and
with
what
potency
they
work
nor
albeit
thou
being
a
man
hast
in
thy
best
years
exercised
thyself
in
part
in
arms
shouldst
thou
the
less
know
what
ease
and
leisure
and
luxury
can
do
in
the
old
to
say
nothing
of
the
young
i
am
then
as
being
of
thee
begotten
of
flesh
and
blood
and
have
lived
so
little
that
i
am
yet
young
and
for
the
one
and
the
other
reason
full
of
carnal
desire
whereunto
the
having
aforetime
by
reason
of
marriage
known
what
pleasure
it
is
to
give
accomplishment
to
such
desire
hath
added
marvellous
strength
unable
therefore
to
withstand
the
strength
of
my
desires
i
addressed
myself
being
young
and
a
woman
to
ensue
that
whereto
they
prompted
me
and
became
enamoured
and
certes
in
this
i
set
my
every
faculty
to
the
endeavouring
that
so
far
as
in
me
lay
no
shame
should
ensue
either
to
thee
or
to
me
through
this
to
which
natural
frailty
moved
me
to
this
end
compassionate
love
and
favouring
fortune
found
and
showed
me
a
very
occult
way
whereby
unknown
of
any
i
won
to
my
desire
and

it

discovered

guiscardo
i
took
not
at
hazard
as
many
women
do
nay
of
deliberate
counsel
i
chose
him
before
every
other
and
with
advisement
prepense
drew
him
to
me
and
by
dint
of
perseverance
and
discretion
on
my
part
and
on
his
i
have
long
had
enjoyment
of
my
desire
whereof
it
seemeth
that
thou
ensuing
rather
vulgar
prejudice
than
truth
reproachest
me
with
more
bitterness
than
of
having
sinned
by
way
of
love
saying
as
if
thou
shouldst
not

been
chagrined
had
i
chosen
therefor
a
man
of

birth

i
have

thou
seest
not
that
thou
blamest

lo
but
boccaccio

the

in
its
rarer
literal
sense
to
lead
to
draw
to
bring
in
but
now
let
us
leave
this
and
look
somewhat
to
the
first
principles
of
things
whereby
thou
wilt
see
that
we
all
get
our
flesh
from
one
same
stock
and
that
all
souls
were
by
one
same
creator
created
with
equal
faculties
equal
powers
and
equal
virtues

was

first
distinguished
between
us
who
were
all
and
still
are
born
equal
wherefore
those
who
had
and
used
the
greatest
sum
thereof
were
called
noble
and
the
rest
abode
not
noble

albeit
contrary
usance
hath
since
obscured
this
primary
law
yet
is
it
nowise
done
away
nor
blotted
out
from
nature
and
good
manners
wherefore
he
who
doth
worthily
manifestly
showeth
himself

gentleman

if
any
call
him
otherwise
not
he
who
is
called
but
he
who
calleth

look
among
all
thy
gentlemen
and
examine
into
their
worth
their
usances
and
their
manners
and
on
the
other
hand
consider
those
of
guiscardo
if
thou
wilt
consent
to
judge
without
animosity
thou
wilt
say
that
he
is
most
noble
and
that
these
thy
nobles
are
all
churls
with
regard
to
his
worth
and
virtue
i
trusted
not
to
the
judgment
of
any
other
but
to
that
of
thy
words
and
of
mine
own
eyes
who
ever
so
commended
him
as
thou
didst
in
all
those
praiseworthy
things
wherefor
a
man
of
worth
should
be
commended
and
certes
not
without
reason
for
if
mine
eyes
deceived
me
not
there
was
no
praise
given
him
of
thee
which
i
saw
him
not
justify
by
deeds
and
that
more
admirably
than
thy
words
availed
to
express
and
even
had
i
suffered
any
deceit
in
this
it
is
by
thyself
i
should
have
been

an
then
thou
say
that
i
have
committed
myself
with
a
man
of
mean
condition
thou
sayst
not
sooth
but
shouldst
thou
say
with
a
poor
man
it
might
peradventure
be
conceded
thee
to
thy
shame

hast
so
ill
known
to

that
thou

what
thou
shouldst

away
altogether
an
thou
in
thine
extreme
old
age
be
disposed
to
do
that
which
thou
usedst
not
being
young
namely
to
deal
cruelly

thy
cruelty

and
waxing
cruel
slay
him
and
me
with
one
same
blow
an
it
seem
to
thee
we
have
deserved
it
the
prince
knew
the
greatness
of
his
daughter
soul
but
notwithstanding
believed
her
not
altogether
so
firmly
resolved
as
she
said
unto
that
which
her
words
gave
out
wherefore
taking
leave
of
her
and
having
laid
aside
all
intent
of
using
rigour
against
her
person
he
thought
to
cool
her
fervent
love
with
other
suffering
and
accordingly
bade
guiscardo
two
guardians
strangle
him
without
noise
that
same
night
and
taking
out
his
heart
bring
it
to
him
they
did
even
as
it
was
commanded
them
and
on
the
morrow
the
prince
let
bring
a
great
and
goodly
bowl
of
gold
and
setting
therein

despatched
it
to
his

the
thing
thou
most

even
as
thou
hast
solaced

that
which
he
loved
most
now
ghismonda
unmoved
from
her
stern
purpose
had
after
her
departure
let
bring
poisonous
herbs
and
roots
and
distilled
and
reduced
them
in
water
so
she
might
have
it
at
hand
an
that
she
feared
should
come
to
pass
the
coming
to
her
with
the
prince
present
and
message
she
took
the
cup
with
a
steadfast
countenance
and
uncovered
it
whenas
she
saw
the
heart
and
apprehended
the
words
of
the
message
she
was
throughly
certified
that
this
was
guiscardo
heart
and
turning
her
eyes
upon
the
messenger
said
to
him
sepulchre
less
of
worth
than
one
of
gold
had
beseemed
a
heart
such
as
this
and
in
this
my
father
hath
done
discreetly
so
saying
she
set
the
heart
to
her
lips
and
kissing
it
said
in
everything
and
even
to
this
extreme
limit
of
my
life
have
i
found
my
father
love
most
tender
towards
me
but
now
more
than
ever
wherefore
do
than
render
him
on
my
part
for
so
great
a
gift
the
last
thanks
i
shall
ever
have
to
give
him
then
bending
down
over
the
cup
which
she
held
fast
she
said
looking
upon
the
heart
sweetest
harbourage

all
my
pleasures
accursed

his
cruelty

maketh
me
now
to

thee

at
all
hours
to
behold
thee
with
those
of
the
mind
thou
hast
finished
thy
course
and
hast
acquitted
thyself
on
such
wise
as
was
vouchsafed
thee
of
fortune
thou
art
come
to
the
end
whereunto
each
runneth
thou
hast
left
the
toils
and
miseries
of
the
world
and
of
thy
very
enemy
thou
hast
that
sepulchre
which
thy
worth
hath
merited
there
lacked
nought
to
thee
to
make
thy
funeral
rites
complete
save
her
tears
whom
in
life
thou
so
lovedst
the
which
that
thou
mightest
have

put
it
into
the
heart
of
my
unnatural
father
to
send
thee
to
me
and
i
will
give
them
to
thee
albeit
i
had
purposed
to
die
with
dry
eyes
and

undismayed
of
aught
and
having
given
them
to
thee
i
will
without
delay
so
do
that
my
soul

shall
rejoin
that
soul
which
thou

so
dearly
guardedst

company
could
i
betake
me
more
contentedly
or
with
better

to
the

with
it

that

in

so
saying
no
otherwise
than
as
she
had
a
fountain
of
water
in
her
head
bowing
herself
over
the
bowl
without
making
any
womanly
outcry
she
began
lamenting
to
shed
so
many
and
such
tears
that
they
were
a
marvel
to
behold
kissing
the
dead
heart
the
while
an
infinite
number
of
times
her
women
who
stood
about
her
understood
not
what
this
heart
was
nor
what
her
words
meant
but
overcome
with
compassion
wept
all
and
in
vain
questioned
her
affectionately
of
the
cause
of
her
lament
and
studied
yet
more
as
best
they
knew
and
might
to
comfort
her
the
lady
having
wept
as
much
as
herseemed
fit
raised
her
head
and
drying
her

said

i

thee

left

aught
else

to
come

thine

so
saying
she
called
for
the
vial
wherein
was
the
water
she
had
made
the
day
before
and
poured
the
latter
into
the
bowl
where
was
the
heart
bathed
with
so
many
of
her
tears
then
setting
her
mouth
thereto
without
any
fear
she
drank
it
all
off
and
having
drunken
mounted
with
the
cup
in
her
hand
upon
the
bed
where
composing
her
body
as
most
decently
she
might
she
pressed
her
dead
lover
heart
to
her
own
and
without
saying
aught
awaited
death
her
women
seeing
and
hearing
all
this
albeit
they
knew
not
what
water
this
was
she
had
drunken
had
sent
to
tell
tancred
everything
and
he
fearing
that
which
came
to
pass
came
quickly
down
into
his
daughter
chamber
where
he
arrived
what
time
she
laid
herself
on
her
bed
and
addressed
himself
too
late
to
comfort
her
with
soft
words
but
seeing
the
extremity
wherein
she
was
he
fell
grievously
whereupon
quoth
the
lady
to
him
keep
these
tears
against
a
less
desired
fate
than
this
of
mine
and
give
them
not
to
me
who
desire
them
not
who
ever
saw
any
other
than
thou
lament
for
that
which
he
himself
hath
willed
nevertheless
if
aught
yet
live

agony
of
his
grief

not
the
prince
to

whereupon
the
young
lady
feeling
herself
come
to
her
end
strained
the
dead
heart
to
her
breast
and
said
ye
with
god

i
go
hence
then
closing
her
eyes
and
losing
every
sense
she
departed
this
life
of
woe
such
then
as
you
have
heard
was
the
sorrowful
ending
of
the
loves
of
guiscardo
and
ghismonda
whose
bodies
tancred
after
much
lamentation
too
late
repenting
him
of
his
cruelty
caused
honourably

giveth
a
lady
to
believe
that
the
angel
gabriel
is
enamoured
of
her
and
in
his
shape
lieth
with
her
sundry
times
after
which
for
fear
of
her
kinsmen
he
casteth
himself
forth
of
her
window
into
the
canal
and
taketh
refuge
in
the
house
of
a
poor
man
who
on
the
morrow
carrieth
him
in
the
guise
of
a
wild
man
of
the
woods
to
the
piazza
where
being
recognized
he
is
taken
by
his
brethren
and
put
in
prison
the
story
told
by
fiammetta
had
more
than
once
brought
the
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
ladies
her
companions
but
it
being
now
finished
the
king
with
a
stern
countenance
said
my
life
would
seem
to
me
a
little
price
to
give
for
half
the
delight
that
guiscardo
had
with
ghismonda
nor
should
any
of
you
ladies
marvel
thereat
seeing
that
every
hour
of
my
life
i
suffer
a
thousand
deaths
nor
for
all
that
is
a
single
particle
of
delight
vouchsafed
me
but
leaving
be
my
affairs
for
the
present
it
is
my
pleasure
that
pampinea
follow
on
the
order
of
the
discourse
with
some
story
of
woeful
chances
and
fortunes
in
part
like
to
mine
own
which
if
she
ensue
like
as
fiammetta
hath
begun
i
shall
doubtless
begin
to
feel
some
dew
fallen
upon
my
fire
pampinea
hearing
the
order
laid
upon
her
more
by
her
affection
apprehended
the
mind
of
the
ladies
her
companions
than
that
of
filostrato
by
his
words
wherefore
being
more
disposed
to
give
them
some
diversion
than
to
content
the
king
farther
than
in
the
mere
letter
of
his
commandment
she
bethought
herself
to
tell
a
story
that
should
without
departing
from
the
proposed
theme
give
occasion
for
laughter
and
accordingly
began
as
follows
footnote
was
more
inclined
to
consider
the
wishes
of
the
ladies
her
companions
which
she
divined
by
sympathy
than
those
of
filostrato
as
shown
by
his
words

it
is
difficult
however
in
this
instance
as
in
many
others
to
discover
with
certainty
boccaccio
exact
meaning
owing
to
his
affectation
of
ciceronian
concision
and
delight
in
obscure
elliptical
forms
of
construction
whilst
his
use
of
words
in
a
remote
or
unfamiliar
sense
and
the
impossibility
of
deciding
in
certain
cases
the
person
of
the
pronouns
and
adjectives
employed
tend
still
farther
to
darken
counsel
if
we
render
sentiment
as
acknowledged
recognized
and
read
sue
as
meaning
instead
of
words
the
whole
sense
of
the
passage
is
changed
and
we
must
read
it
more
by
her
sentiment
by
the
tendency
and
spirit
of
her
story
recognized
the
inclination
of
her
companions
than
that
of
the
king
by
her
actual
words
i
have
commented
thus
at
large
on
this
passage
in
order
to
give
my
readers
some
idea
of
the
difficulties
which
at
every
page
beset
the
translator
of
the
decameron
and
which
make
boccaccio
perhaps
the
most
troublesome
of
all
authors
to
render
into
representative
english
the
vulgar
have
a
proverb
to
the
effect
that
he
who
is
naught
and
is
held
good
may
do
ill
and
it
is
not
believed
of
him
the
which
affordeth
me
ample
matter
for
discourse
upon
that
which
hath
been
proposed
to
me
and
at
the
same
time
to
show
what
and
how
great
is
the
hypocrisy
of
the
clergy
who
with
garments
long
and
wide
and
faces
paled
by
art
and
voices
humble
and
meek
to
solicit
the
folk
but
exceeding
loud
and
fierce
to
rebuke
in
others
their
own
vices
pretend
that
themselves
by
taking
and
others
by
giving
to
them
come
to
salvation
and
to
boot
not
as
men
who
have
like
ourselves
to
purchase
paradise
but
as
in
a
manner
they
were
possessors
and
lords
thereof
assign
unto
each
who
dieth
according
to
the
sum
of
the
monies
left
them
by
him
a
more
or
less
excellent
place
there
studying
thus
to
deceive
first
themselves
an
they
believe
as
they
say
and
after
those
who
put
faith
for
that
matter
in
their
words
anent
whom
were
it
permitted
me
to
discover
as
much
as
it
behoved
i
would
quickly
make
clear
to
many
simple
folk
that
which
they
keep
hidden
under
those
huge
wide
gowns
of
theirs
but
would
god
it
might
betide
them
all
of
their
cozening
tricks
as
it
betided
a
certain
minor
friar
and
he
no
youngling
but
held
one
of
the
first
casuists
in
venice
of
whom
it
especially
pleaseth
me
to
tell
you
so
as
peradventure
somewhat
to
cheer
your
hearts
that

full
of
compassion

there
was

seeing

might
no

he
removed
in

the
receptacle
of
every
kind
of

thinking
to
find
there
new

carrying
on

went

from

he
contrived
on
such

beyond
measure
in
love

reserving
blandishments
for
a
more
convenient

he
proceeded
for
the
nonce
so
he
might
show
himself
a
holy

to
rebuke

and
tell
her
that
this
was
vainglory

so
forth
the

was
an

knew
not
what
one
beauty
was
more
than
another

he
unwilling

overmuch

confession

a

in

ere
i
could
turn
me
to
see
what
it
might

beheld
over

a
very
fair
youth
with
a
stout
cudgel
in
his
hand
who
took
me
by
the
gown
and
dragging
me
to

gave
me
such
a
drubbing
that
he
broke
every
bone
in

i
asked
him
why
he
used
me
thus

he
answered
for
that
thou

that

might
not

he
purposeth
for
your
delectation
to

my
lady
conceit
answered
that
it
liked
her
well
that
the
angel
gabriel
loved
her
seeing
she
loved
him
well
nor
ever
failed
to
light
a
candle
of
a
groat
before
him
whereas
she
saw
him
depictured
and
that
what
time
soever
he
chose
to
come
to
her
he
should
be
dearly
welcome
and
would
find
her
all
alone
in
her
chamber
but
on
this
condition
that
he
should
not
leave
her
for
the
virgin
mary
whose
great
it
was
said
he
was
as
indeed
appeareth
inasmuch
as
in
every
place
where
she
saw
him
limned
he
was
on
his
knees
before
her
moreover
she
said
it
must
rest
with
him
to
come
in
whatsoever
form
he
pleased
so
but
she
was
not
affrighted
then
said
fra
alberto
you
speak
sagely
and
i
will
without
fail
take
order
with
him
of
that
which
you
tell
me
but
you
may
do
me
a
great
favour
which
will
cost
you
nothing
it
is
this
that
you
will
him
come
with
this
my
body
and
i
will
tell
you
in
what
you
will
do
me
a
favour
you
must
know
that
he
will
take
my
soul
forth
of
my
body
and
put
it
in
paradise
whilst
he
himself
will
enter
into
me
and
what
while
he
abideth
with
you
so
long
will
my
soul
abide
in
paradise
all
my
heart
answered
dame
littlewit
will
well
that
you
have
this
consolation
in
requital
of
the
buffets
he
gave
you
on
my
account
then
said
fra
alberto
that
he
find
the
door
of
your
house
open
so
he
may
come
in
thereat
for
that
coming
in
human
form
as
he
will
he
might
not
enter
save
by
the
door
the
lady
replied
that
it
should
be
done
whereupon
the
monk
took
his
leave
and
she
abode
in
such
a
transport
of
exultation
that
her
breech
touched
not
her
shift
and
herseemed
a
thousand
years
till
the
angel
gabriel
should
come
to
her
meanwhile
fra
alberto
bethinking
him
that
it
behoved
him
play
the
cavalier
not
the
angel
that
night
proceeded
to
fortify
himself
with
confections
and
other
good
things
so
he
might
not
lightly
be
unhorsed
then
getting
leave
as
soon
as
it
was
night
he
repaired
with
one
of
his
comrades
to
the
house
of
a
woman
a
friend
of
his
whence
he
was
used
whiles
to
take
his
start
what
time
he
went
to
course
the
fillies
and
thence
whenas

having
disguised
himself
he
betook
him
to
the
lady
house
there
he
tricked
himself
out
as
an
angel
with
the
trappings
he
had
brought
with
him
and
going
up
entered
the
chamber
of
the
lady
who
seeing
this
creature
all
in
white
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
the
angel
blessed
her
and
raising
her
to
her
feet
signed
to
her
to
go
to
bed
which
she
studious
to
obey
promptly
did
and
the
angel
after
lay
down
with
his
devotee
now
fra
alberto
was
a
personable
man
of
his
body
and
a
lusty
and
excellent
well
set
up
on
his
legs
wherefore
finding
himself
in
bed
with
madam
lisetta
who
was
young

he
showed
himself
another

bedfellow
than
her
husband
and
many
a
time
that
night
took
flight
without
wings
whereof
she
avowed
herself
exceeding
content
and
eke
he
told
her
many
things
of
the
glories
of
heaven
then
the
day
drawing
near
after
taking
order
for
his
return
he
made
off
with
his
trappings
and
returned
to
his
comrade
whom
the
good
woman
of
the
house
had
meanwhile
borne
amicable
company
lest
he
should
get
a
fright
lying
alone
as
for
the
lady
no
sooner
had
she
dined
than
taking
her
with
her
she
betook
herself
to
fra
alberto
and
gave
him
news
of
the
angel
gabriel
telling
him
that
which
she
had
heard
from
him
of
the
glories
of
life
eternal
and
how
he
was
made
and
adding
to
boot
marvellous
stories
of
her
own
invention
said
he
know
not
how
you
fared
with
him
i
only
know
that
yesternight
whenas
he
came
to
me
and
i
did
your
message
to
him
he
suddenly
transported
my
soul
amongst
such
a
multitude
of
roses
and
other
flowers
that
never
was
the
like
thereof
seen
here
below
and
i
abode
in
one
of
the
most
delightsome
places
that
was
aye
until
the
morning
but
what
became
of
my
body
meanwhile
i
know
not
i
not
tell
you
answered
the
lady
body
lay
all
night
in
mine
arms
with
the
angel
gabriel
if
you
believe
me
not
look
under
your
left
pap
whereas
i
gave
the
angel
such
a
kiss
that
the
marks
of
it
will
stay
by
you
for
some
days
to
come
quoth
the
friar
you
so
then
will
i
do
a
thing
i
have
not
done
this
great
while
i
will
strip
myself
to
see
if
you
tell
truth
then
after
much
prating
the
lady
returned
home
and
fra
alberto
paid
her
many
visits
in
without
suffering
any
hindrance
however
it
chanced
one
day
that
madam
lisetta
being
in
dispute
with
a
gossip
of
hers
upon
the
question
of
female
charms
to
set
her
own
above
all
others
said
like
a
woman
who
had
little
wit
in
her
noddle
you
but
knew
whom
my
beauty
pleaseth
in
truth
you
would
hold
your
peace
of
other
women
the
other
longing
to
hear
said
as
one
who
knew
her
well
maybe
you
say
sooth
but
knowing
not
who
this
may
be
one
can
not
turn
about
so
lightly
thereupon
quoth
lisetta
who
was
eath
enough
to
draw
it
must
go
no
farther
but
he
i
mean
is
the
angel
gabriel
who
loveth
me
more
than
himself
as
the
fairest
lady
for
that
which
he
telleth
me
who
is
in
the
world
or
the
maremma
the
other
had
a
mind
to
laugh
but
contained
herself
so
she
might
make
lisetta
speak
farther
and
said
madam
an
the
angel
gabriel
be
your
lover
and
tell
you
this
needs
must
it
be
so
but
methought
not
the
angels
did
these
things
answered
the
lady
are
mistaken
zounds
he
doth
what
you
wot
of
better
than
my
husband
and
telleth
me
they
do
it
also
up
yonder
but
for
that
i
seem
to
him
fairer
than
any
she
in
heaven
he
hath
fallen
in
love
with
me
and
cometh
full
oft
to
lie
with
me

fra

who
accordingly
repaired
one
night
to
the
lady
house
to
reprove
her
but
hardly
had
he
put
off
his

ere

fra

hearing
this
and
guessing
what
was
to
do
started
up
and
having
no
other
resource
opened
a
window
which
gave
upon
the
grand
canal
and
cast
himself
thence
into
the
water
the
canal
was
deep
there
and
he
could
swim
well
so
that
he
did
himself
no
hurt
but
made
his
way
to
the
opposite
bank
and
hastily
entering
a
house
that
stood
open
there
besought
a
poor
man
whom
he
found
within
to
save
his
life
for
the
love
of
god
telling
him
a
tale
of
his
own
fashion
to
explain
how
he
came
there
at
that
hour
and
naked
the
good
man
was
moved
to
pity
and
it
behoving
him
to
go
do
his
occasions
he
put
him
in
his
own
bed
and
bade
him
abide
there
against
his
return
then
locking
him
in
he
went
about
his
affairs
meanwhile
the
entered
her
chamber
and
found
that
the
angel
gabriel
had
flown
leaving
his
wings
there
whereupon
seeing
themselves
baffled
they
gave
her
all
manner
hard
words
and
ultimately
made
off
to
their
own
house
with
the
angel
trappings
leaving
her
disconsolate
broad
day
come
the
good
man
with
whom
fra
alberto
had
taken
refuge
being
on
the
rialto
heard
how
the
angel
gabriel
had
gone
that
night
to
lie
with
madam
lisetta
and
being
surprised
by
her
kinsmen
had
cast
himself
for
fear
into
the
canal
nor
was
it
known
what
was
come
of
him
and
concluded
forthright
that
this
was
he
whom
he
had
at
home
accordingly
he
returned
thither
and
recognizing
the
monk
found
means
after
much
parley
to
make
him
fetch
him
fifty
ducats
an
he
would
not
have
him
give
him
up
to
the
lady
kinsmen
having
gotten
the
money
and
fra

offering
to
depart
thence
the
good
man
said
to
him
is
no
way
of
escape
for
you
an
it
be
not
one
that
i
will
tell
you
we
hold
a
festival
wherein
one
bringeth
a
man
clad
and
another
one
accoutred
as
a
wild
man
of
the
woods
and
what
not
else
some
one
thing
and
some
another
and
there
is
a
hunt
held
in
mark
place
which
finished
the
festival
is
at
an
end
and
after
each
goeth
whither
it
pleaseth

whom
he
hath
brought

you
will
have
me
lead
you
thither
after
one
or
other
of
these
fashions
i
can
after
carry
you
whither
you
please
ere
it
be
spied
out
that
you
are
here
else
i
know
not
how
you
are
to
get
away
without
being
recognized
for
the

concluding
that
you
must
be
somewhere
hereabout
have
set
a
watch
for
you
on
all
sides
hard
as
it
seemed
to
fra
alberto
to
go
on
such
wise
nevertheless
of
the
fear
he
had
of
the
lady
kinsmen
he
resigned
himself
thereto
and
told
his
host
whither
he
would
be
carried
leaving
the
manner
to
him
accordingly
the
other
having
smeared
him
all
over
with
honey
and
covered
him
with
down
clapped
a
chain
about
his
neck
and
a
mask
on
his
face
then
giving
him
a
great
staff
in
on
hand
and
in
the
other
two
great
dogs
which
he
had
fetched
from
the
shambles
he
despatched
one
to
the
rialto
to
make
public
proclamation
that
whoso
would
see
the
angel
gabriel
should
repair
to
mark
place
and
this
was
venetian
loyalty
this
done
after
a
while
he
brought
him
forth
and
setting
him
before
himself
went
holding
him
by
the
chain
behind
to
the
no
small
clamour
of
the
folk
who
said
all
be
this
what
be
this
till
he
came
to
the
place
where
what
with
those
who
had
followed
after
them
and
those
who
hearing
the
proclamation
were
come
thither
from
the
rialto
were
folk
without
end
there
he
tied
his
wild
man
to
a
column
in
a
raised
and
high
place
making
a
show
of
awaiting
the
hunt
whilst
the
flies
and
gads
gave
the
monk
exceeding
annoy
for
that
he
was
besmeared
with
honey
but
when
he
saw
the
place
well
filled
making
as
he
would
unchain
his
wild
man
he
pulled
off
fra
alberto
mask
and
said
since
the
bear
cometh
not
and
there
is
no
hunt
toward

purpose
so
you
may
not

come

turning

that

in

there
was
overmuch
before

which

turning

you

laughing
you
are
too
cruel
towards
lovers
an
you
desire
of
them
only
an
ill
end

to
obey
you
i
will
tell
a
story
of
three
who
all
ended
equally
ill
having
had
scant
enjoyment
of
their
loves
so
saying
she
began
thus
young

as
you
should
manifestly
know
every
vice
may
turn
to
the
grievous
hurt
of
whoso
practiseth
it
and
often
of
other
folk
also
but
of
all
others
that
which
with
the
slackest
rein
carrieth
us
away
to
our
peril
meseemeth
is
anger
which
is
none
otherwhat
than
a
sudden
and
unconsidered
emotion
aroused
by
an
affront
suffered
and
which
banishing
all
reason
and
overclouding
the
eyes
of
the
understanding
with
darkness
kindleth
the
soul
to
the
hottest
fury
and
although
this
often
cometh
to
pass
in
men
and
more
in
one
than
in
another
yet
hath
it
been
seen
aforetime
to
work
greater
mischiefs
in
women
for
that
it
is
lightlier
enkindled
in
these
latter
and
burneth
in
them
with
a
fiercer
flame
and
urgeth
them
with
less
restraint
nor
is
this
to
be
marvelled
at
for
that
an
we
choose
to
consider
we
may
see
that
fire
of
its
nature
catcheth
quicklier
to
light
and
delicate
things
than
to
those
which
are
denser
and
more
ponderous
and
we
women
indeed
let
men
not
take
it
ill
are
more
delicately
fashioned
than
they
and
far
more
mobile
wherefore
seeing
that
we
are
naturally
inclined
thereunto
and
considering
after
how
our
mansuetude
and
our
loving
kindness
are
of
repose
and
pleasance
to
the
men
with
whom
we
have
to
do
and
how
big
with
harm

are
anger

the
intent

we
may
with
a
more
steadfast
mind
keep
ourselves
from

story
how
the
loves

young

as
many

marseilles
is
as
you
know
a
very
ancient
and
noble
city
situate
in
provence
on
the
and
was
once
more
abounding
in
rich
and
great
merchants
than
it
is
nowadays
among
the
latter
was
one
called
narnald
cluada
a
man
of
mean
extraction
but
of
renowned
good
faith
and
a
loyal
merchant
rich
beyond
measure
in
lands
and
monies
who
had
by
a
wife
of
his
several
children
whereof
the
three
eldest
were
daughters
two
of

born
at
a
birth
were
fifteen

fourteen
years
old

aught
awaited
by

the
return
of

who
was
gone
into

with
his
merchandise

elder
were

man
of
gentle
birth

poor
called

was
enamoured
as
much
as
man
might
be
and
she
of
him
and
they
had
contrived
to
do
on
such
wise
that
without
any
knowing
it
they
had
enjoyment
of
their
loves
they
had
already
a
pretty
while
enjoyed
this
satisfaction
when
it
chanced
that
two
young
companions
named
the
one
folco
and
the
other
ughetto
whose
fathers
were
dead
leaving
them
very
rich
fell
in
love
the
one
with
maddalena
and
the
other
with
bertella
restagnone
noting
this
it
having
been
shown
him
of
ninetta
bethought
himself
that
he
might
make
shift
to
supply
his
own
lack
by
means
of
the
newcomers
love
accordingly
he
clapped
up
an
acquaintance
with
them
so
that
now
one
now
the
other
of
them
accompanied
him
to
visit
their
mistresses
and
his
and
when
himseemed
he
was
grown
privy
enough
with
them
and
much
their
friend
he
called
them
one
day
into
his
house
and
said
to
them
youths
our
commerce
should
have
certified
you
how
great
is
the
love
i
bear
you
and
that
i
would
do
for
you
that
which
i
would
do
for
myself
and
for
that
i
love
you
greatly
i
purpose
to
discover
to
you
that
which
hath
occurred
to
my
mind
and
you
and
i
together
will
after
take
such
counsel
thereof
as
shall
seem
to
you
best
you
an
your

lie
not
and
for
that
to

which
meseemeth

your

daily
and
nightly
burn
with
an
exceeding
passion
for
the
two
young
ladies
beloved
of
you
as
do
i
for
the
third
their
sister
and
to
this
ardour
an
you
will
consent
thereunto
my
heart
giveth
me
to
find
a
very
sweet
and

remedy

which
is
as
follows
you

i
am
not

you
will
agree

the
proposal
i
have
to
make
the
two
young
men
who
were
beyond
measure
inflamed
hearing
that
they
were
to
have
their
lasses
were
not
long
in
making
up
their
minds
but
answered
that
so
this
should
ensue
they
were
ready
to
do
as
he
said
restagnone
having
gotten
this
answer
from
the
young
men
found
means
a
few
days
after
to
foregather
with
ninetta
to
whom
he
could
not
come
without
great
unease
and
after
he
had
abidden
with
her
awhile
he
told
her
what
he
had
proposed
to
the
others
and
with
many
arguments
studied
to
commend
the
emprise
to
her
this
was
little
uneath
to
him
seeing
that
she
was
yet
more
desirous
than
himself
to
be
with
him
without
suspect
wherefore
she
answered
him
frankly
that
it
liked
her
well
and
that
her
sisters
would
do
whatever
she
wished
especially
in
this
and
bade
him
make
ready
everything
needful
therefor
as
quickliest
he
might
restagnone
accordingly
returned
to
the
two
young
men
who
still
importuned
him
amain
to
do
that
whereof
he
had
bespoken
them
and
told
them
that
so
far
as
concerned
their
mistresses
the
matter
was
settled
then
having
determined
among
themselves
to
go
to
crete
they
sold
certain
lands
they
had
under
colour
of
meaning
to
go
with
the
price
and
having
made
money
of
all
their
other
goods
bought
a
light
brigantine
and
secretly
equipped
it
to
the
utmost
advantage
footnote
the
possession
of
their
mistresses
meanwhile
ninetta
who
well
enough
knew
her
sisters
mind
with
soft
words
inflamed
them
with
such
a
liking
for
the
venture
that
themseemed
they
might
not
live
to
see
the
thing
accomplished
accordingly
the
night
come
when
they
were
to
go
aboard
the
brigantine
the
three
sisters
opened
a
great
coffer
of
their
father
and
taking
thence
a
vast
quantity
of
money
and
jewels
stole
out
of
the
house
according
to
the
given
order
they
found
their
gallants
awaiting
them
and
going
straightway
all
aboard
the
brigantine
they
thrust
the
oars
into
the
water
and
put
out
to
sea
nor
rested
till
they
came
on
the
following
evening
to
genoa
where
the
new
lovers
for
the
first
time
took
ease
and
joyance
of
their
loves
there
having
refreshed
themselves
with
that
whereof
they
had
need
they
set
out
again
and
sailing
from
port
to
port
came
ere
it
was
the
eighth
day
without
any
hindrance
to
crete
where
they
bought
great
and
goodly
estates
near
candia
and
made
them
very
handsome
and
delightsome
thereon
here
they
fell
to
living
like
lords
and
passed
their
days
in
banquets
and
joyance
and
merrymaking
the
happiest
men
in
the
world
they
and
their
mistresses
with
great
plenty
of
servants
and
hounds
and
hawks
and
horses
abiding
on
this

it
befell
even
as
we
see
it
happen
all
day
long
that
how
much
soever
things
may
please
they
grow
irksome
an
one

overgreat
plenty
thereof
that
restagnone
who
had
much
loved
ninetta
being
now
able
to
have
her
at
his
every
pleasure
without
let
or
hindrance
began
to
weary
of
her
and
consequently
his
love
for
her
began
to
wane
having
seen
at
entertainment
a
damsel
of
the
country
a
fair
and
noble
young
lady
who
pleased
him
exceedingly
he
fell
to
courting
her
with
all
his
might
giving
marvellous
entertainments
in
her
honor
and
plying
her
with
all
manner
gallantries
which
ninetta
coming
to
know
she
fell
into
such
a
jealousy
that
he
could
not
go
a
step
but
she
heard
of
it
and
after
harassed
both
him
and
herself
with
words
and
reproaches
on
account
thereof
but
like
as
overabundance
of
aught
begetteth
weariness
even
so
doth
the
denial
of
a
thing
desired
redouble
the
appetite
accordingly
ninetta
reproaches
did
but
fan
the
flame
of
restagnone
new
love
and
in
process
of
time
it
came
to
pass
that
whether
he
had
the
favours
of
the
lady
he
loved
or
not
ninetta
held
it
for
certain
whoever
it
was
reported
it
to
her
wherefore
she
fell
into
such
a
passion
of
grief
and
thence
passed
into
such
a
fit
of
rage
and
despite
that
the
love
which
she
bore
restagnone
was
changed
to
bitter
hatred
and
blinded
by
her
wrath
she
bethought
herself
to
avenge
by
his
death
the
affront
which
herseemed
she
had
received
accordingly
betaking
herself
to
an
old
greek
woman
a
past
mistress
in
the
art
of
compounding
poisons
she
induced
her
with
gifts
and
promises
to
make
her
a
water
which
she
without
considering
farther
gave
restagnone
one
evening
to
drink
he
being
heated
and
misdoubting
him
not
thereof
and
such
was
the
potency
of
the
poison
that
ere
morning
came
it
had
slain
him
folco
and
ughetto
and
their
mistresses
hearing
of
his
death
and
knowing
not
of
what
poison
he
had
died
bewept
him
bitterly
together
with
ninetta
and
caused
bury
him
honourably
but
not
many
days
after
it
chanced
that
the
old
woman
who
had
compounded
the
poisoned
water
for
ninetta
was
taken
for
some
other
misdeed
and
being
put
to
the
torture
confessed
to
this
amongst
her
other
crimes
fully
declaring
that
which
had
betided
by
reason
thereof
whereupon
the
duke
of
crete
without
saying
aught
of
the
matter
beset
folco
palace
by
surprise
one
night
and
without
any
noise
or
gainsayal
carried
off
ninetta
prisoner
from
whom
without
putting
her
to
the
torture
he
readily
got
what
he
would
know
of
the
death

from

fire
whereto
they
doubted
not
she
would
be
condemned
as
indeed
she
richly
deserved

all
seemed

for
that
the

abode
firm
in
willing

her

who
was
a
beautiful
young
woman
and
had
long
been
courted
by
the

had
never

do
aught

by
complying
with

message
pleased
the
duke
and
after
long
debate
with
himself
if
he
should
do
as
she
proposed
he
ultimately
agreed
thereto
and
said
that
he
was
ready

one
night
having
with

consent
caused

went
secretly
to

a
show
of
putting
ninetta
in
a
sack
and
of
purposing
to
let
sink
her
that
night
in

carried
her

could

soon
became
aware

in
the

whereat
he
marvelled
exceedingly
and
suddenly
waxing
suspicious
for
that
he
had
heard
of
the
passion
for
maddalena
asked
the
latter
how
her
sister
came
to
be
there
maddalena
began
a
long
story
which
she
had
devised
to
account
to
him
therefor
but
was
little
believed
of
her
lover
who
was
shrewd
and
constrained
her
to
confess
the
truth
which
after
long
parley
she
told
him
folco
overcome
with
chagrin
and
inflamed
with
rage
pulled
out
a
sword
and
slew
her
whilst
she
in
vain
besought
mercy

fearing

wrath

justice
of

left

there
were

of
the
envy

hatred
they
bore

forthright
gave
notice
thereof

dying
before
his

left

was
diligently
reared
by

became
a
very
goodly
youth
and
a
renowned
for
prowess

courtesy
nor

fame

limits

resounding
in

nowhere
more
glorious
than
in
barbary
which
in
those
days
was
tributary
to
the
king
of
sicily
amongst
the
rest
to
whose
ears
came
the
magnificent
fame
of
gerbino
valour
and
courtesy
was
a
daughter
of
the
king
of
tunis
who
according
to
the
report
of
all
who
had
seen
her
was
one
of
the
fairest
creatures
ever
fashioned
by
nature
and
the
best
bred
and
of
a
noble
and
great
soul
she
delighting
to
hear
tell
of
men
of
valour
with
such
goodwill
received
the
tales
recounted
by
one
and
another
of
the
deeds
valiantly
done
of
gerbino
and
they
so
pleased
her
that
picturing
to
herself
the
prince
fashion
she
became
ardently
enamoured
of
him
and
discoursed
more
willingly
of
him
than
of
any
other
and
hearkened
to
whoso
spoke
of
him
on
the
other
hand
the
great
renown
of
her
beauty
and
worth
had
won
to
sicily
as
elsewhither
and
not
without
great
delight
nor
in
vain
had
it
reached
the
ears
of
gerbino
nay
it
had
inflamed
him
with
love
of
her
no
less
than
that
which
she
herself
had
conceived
for
him
wherefore
desiring
beyond
measure
to
see
her
against
he
should
find
a
colourable
occasion
of
having
his
grandfather
leave
to
go
to

charged
his
every
friend

went
thither
to
make
known
to
her
as
best
he
might
his
secret
and
great
love
and
bring
him
news
of
her
this
was
very
dexterously
done
by
one
of
them
who
under
pretence
of
carrying
her
women
trinkets
to
view
as
do
merchants
throughly
discovered
gerbino
passion
to
her
and
avouched
the
prince
and
all
that
was
his
to
be
at
her
commandment
the
princess
received
the
messenger
and
the
message
with
a
glad
flavour
and
answering
that
she
burnt
with
like
love
for
the
prince
sent
him
one
of
her
most
precious
jewels
in
token
thereof
this
gerbino
received
with
the
utmost
joy
wherewith
one
can
receive
whatsoever
precious
thing
and
wrote
to
her
once
and
again
by
the

messenger

her
the
most
costly
gifts

farther

one
hand
and

on

burning
with
desire
it
befell
that
the
king
of
tunis
gave
her
in
marriage
to
the
king
of
granada
whereat
she
was
beyond
measure
chagrined
bethinking
herself
that
not
only
should
she
be
separated
from
her
lover
by
long
distance
but
was
like
to
be
altogether
parted
from
him
and
had
she
seen
a
means
thereto
she
would
gladly
so
this
might
not
betide
have
fled
from
her
father
and
betaken
herself
to
gerbino
gerbino
in
like
manner
hearing
of
this
marriage
was
beyond

sorrowful
therefor
and
often
bethought
himself
to
take
her
by
force
if
it
should
chance
that
she
went
to
her
husband
by
sea
the
king
of
tunis
getting
some
inkling
of
gerbino
love
and
purpose
and
fearing
his
valour
and
prowess
sent
to
king
guglielmo
whenas
the
time
came
for
despatching
her
to
granada
advising
him
of
that
which
he
was
minded
to
do
and
that
having
assurance
from
him
that
he
should
not
be
hindered
therein
by
gerbino
or
others
he
purposed
to
do
it
the
king
of
sicily
who
was
an
old
man
and
had
heard
nothing
of
passion
and
consequently
suspected
not
that
it
was
for
this
that
such
an
assurance
was
demanded
freely
granted
it
and
in
token
thereof
sent
the
king
of
tunis
a
glove
of
his
the
latter
having
gotten
the
desired
assurance
caused
equip
a
very
great
and
goodly
ship
in
the
port
of
carthage
and
furnish
it
with
what
was
needful
for
those
who
were
to
sail
therein
and
having
fitted
and
adorned
it
for
the
sending
of
his
daughter
into
granada
awaited
nought
but
weather
the
young
lady
who
saw
and
knew
all
this
despatched
one
of
her
servants
secretly
to
palermo
bidding
him
salute
the
gallant
gerbino
on
her
part
and
tell
him
that
she
was
to
sail
in
a
few
days
for
granada
wherefore
it
would
now
appear
if
he
were
as
valiant
a
man
as
was
said
and
if
he
loved
her
as
much
as
he
had
sundry
times
declared
to
her
her
messenger
did
his
errand
excellent
well
and
returned
to
tunis
whilst
gerbino
hearing
this
and
knowing
that
his
grandfather
had
given
the
king
of
tunis
assurance
knew
not
what
to
do
however
urged
by
love
and
that
he
might
not
appear
a
craven
he
betook
himself
to
messina
where
he
hastily
armed
two
light
galleys
and
manning
them
with
men
of
approved
valour
set
sail
with
them
for
the
coast
of
sardinia
looking
for
the
lady
ship
to
pass
there
nor
was
he
far
out
in
his
reckoning
for
he
had
been
there
but
a
few
days
when
the
ship
hove
in
sight
with
a
light
wind
not
far
from
the
place
where
he
lay
expecting
it
gerbino
seeing
this
said
to
his
companions
an
you
be
the
men
of
mettle
i
take
you
for
methinketh
there
is
none
of
you
but
hath
either
felt
or
feeleth
love
without
which
as
i
take
it
no
mortal
can
have
aught
of
valour
or
worth
in
himself
and
if
you
have
been
or
are
enamoured
it
will
be
an
easy
thing
to
you
to
understand
my
desire
i
love
and
love
hath
moved
me
to
give
you
this
present
pains
and
she
whom
i
love
is
in
the
ship
which
you
see
becalmed
yonder
and
which
beside
that
thing
which
i
most
desire
is
full
of
very
great
riches
these
latter
an
ye
be
men
of
valour
we
may
with
little
difficulty
acquire
fighting
manfully
of
which
victory
i
desire
nothing
to
my
share
save
one
sole
lady
for
whose
love
i
have
taken
up
arms
everything
else
shall
freely
be
yours

then

us

without

the
gallant
gerbino
had
no
need
of
many
words
for
that
the
messinese
who
were
with
him
being
eager
for
plunder
were
already
disposed
to
do
that
unto
which
he
exhorted
them
wherefore
making
a
great
outcry
at
the
end
of
his
speech
that
it
should
be
so
they
sounded
the
trumpets
and
catching
up
their
arms
thrust
the
oars
into
the
water
and
made
for
the
tunis
ship
they
who
were
aboard
this
latter
seeing
the
galleys
coming
afar
off
and
being
unable
to
flee
made
ready
for
defence
the
gallant
gerbino
accosting
the
ship
let
command
that
the
masters
thereof
should
be
sent
on
board
the
galleys
an
they
had
no
mind
to
fight
but
the
saracens
having
certified
themselves
who
they
were
and
what
they
sought
declared
themselves
attacked
of
them
against
the
faith
plighted
them
by
king
guglielmo
in
token
whereof
they
showed
the
latter
glove
and
altogether
refused
to
surrender
themselves
save
for
stress
of
battle
or
to
give
them
aught
that
was
in
the
ship

gerbino
who
saw
the
lady
upon
the
poop
far
fairer
than
he
had
pictured
her
to
himself
and
was
more
inflamed
than
ever
replied
to
the
showing
of
the
glove
that
there
were
no
falcons
there
at
that
present
and
consequently
there
needed
no
gloves
wherefore
an
they
chose
not
to
give
up
the
lady
they
must
prepare
to
receive
battle
accordingly
without
further
parley
they
fell
to
casting
shafts
and
stones
at
one
another
and
on
this
wise
they
fought
a
great
while
with
loss
on
either
side
at
last
gerbino
seeing
that
he
did
little
to
the
purpose
took
a
little
vessel
he
had
brought
with
him
out
of
sardinia
and
setting
fire
therein
thrust
it
with
both
the
galleys
aboard
the
ship
the
saracens
seeing
this
and
knowing
that
they
must
of
necessity
surrender
or
die
fetched
the
king
daughter
who
wept
below
on
deck
and
brought
her
to
the
ship
prow
then
calling
gerbino
they
butchered
her
before
his
eyes
what
while
she
called
for
mercy
and
succour
and
cast
her
into
the
sea
saying
her
we
give
her
to
thee
such
as
we
may
and
such
as
thine
unfaith
hath
merited
gerbino
seeing
their
barbarous
deed
caused
lay
himself
alongside
the
ship
and
recking
not
of
shaft
or
stone
boarded
it
as
if
courting
death
in
spite
of
those
who
were
therein
then
even

cruelly
slew

waxing
in

enkindled

caused
the
sailors
fetch
thereout
what
they
might
in

of

pains
and
descended
thence

gotten
but
a
sorry
victory
over
his
adversaries
then

take
up

from

elisa
tale
being
ended
and

commended
of
the
king
filomena
was
bidden
to
discourse
who
full
of
compassion
for
the
wretched
gerbino
and
his
mistress
after
a
piteous
sigh
began
thus
my

gracious
ladies
will
not
treat
of
folk
of
so
high
condition
as
were
those
of
whom
elisa
hath
told
yet
peradventure
it
will
be
no
less
pitiful
and
what
brought
me
in
mind
of
it
was
the
mention
a
little
before
of
messina
where
the
case
befell
there
were
then
in
messina
three
young
brothers
merchants
and
left
very
rich
by
their
father
who
was
a
man
of
san
gimignano
and
they
had
an
only
sister
lisabetta
by
name
a
right
fair
and
maiden
whom
whatever
might
have
been
the
reason
thereof
they
had
not
yet
married
now
these
brothers
had
in
one
of
their
warehouses
a
youth
of
pisa
called
lorenzo
who
did
and
ordered
all
their
affairs
and
was
very
comely
and
agreeable
of
person
wherefore
lisabetta
looking
sundry
times
upon
him
it
befell
that
he
began
strangely
to
please
her
of
which
lorenzo
taking
note
at
one
time
and
another
he
in
like
manner
leaving
his
other
loves
began
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
her
and
so
went
the
affair
that
each
being
alike
pleasing
to
the
other
it
was
no
great
while
before
taking
assurance
they
did
that
which
each
of
them
most
desired
continuing
on
this
wise
and
enjoying
great
pleasure
and
delight
one
of
the
other
they
knew
not
how
to
do
so
secretly
but
that
one
night
lisabetta
going
whereas
lorenzo
lay
was
unknown
to
herself
seen
of
the
eldest
of
her
brothers
who
being
a
prudent
youth
for
all
the
annoy
it
gave
him
to
know
this
thing
being
yet
moved
by
more
honourable
counsel
abode
without
sign
or
word
till
the
morning
revolving
in
himself
various
things
anent
the
matter
the
day
being
come
he
recounted
to
his
brothers
that
which
he
had
seen
the
past
night
of
lisabetta
and
lorenzo
and
after
long
advisement
with
them
determined
so
that
neither
to
them
nor
to
their
sister
should
any
reproach
ensue
thereof
to
pass
the
thing
over
in
silence
and
feign
to
have
seen
and
known
nothing
thereof
till
such
time
as
without
hurt
or
unease
to
themselves
they
might
avail
to
do
away
this
shame
from
their
sight
ere
it
should
go
farther
in
this
mind
abiding
and
devising
and
laughing
with
lorenzo
as
was
their
wont
it
befell
that
one
day
feigning
to
go
forth
the
city
all
three
they
carried
him
with
them
to
a
very
lonely
and
remote
place
and
there
the
occasion
offering
they
slew
him
whilst
he
was
off
his
guard
and
buried
him
on
such
wise
that
none
had
knowledge
of
it
then
returning
to
messina
they
gave
out
that
they
had
despatched
him
somewhither
for
their
occasions
the
which
was
the
lightlier
credited
that
they
were
often
used
to
send
him
abroad
about
their
business
lorenzo
returning
not
and
lisabetta
often
and
instantly
questioning
her
brothers
of
him
as
one
to
whom
the
long
delay
was
grievous
it
befell
one
day
as
she
very
urgently
enquired
of
him
that
one
of
them
said
to
her
meaneth
this
what
hast
thou
to
do
often
of
him
an
thou
question
of
him
with
lorenzo
that
thou
askest
thus
more
we
will
make
thee
such
answer
as
thou
deservest
wherefore
the
girl
sad
and
grieving
and
fearful
she
knew
not
of
what
abode
without
more
asking
yet
many
a
time
anights
she
piteously
called
him
and
prayed
him
come
to
her
and
whiles
with
many
tears
she
complained
of
his
long
tarrying
and
thus
without
a
moment
gladness
she
abode
expecting
him
alway
till
one
night
having
sore
lamented
lorenzo
for
that
he
returned
not
and
being
at
last
fallen
asleep
weeping
he
appeared
to
her
in
a
dream
pale
and
all
disordered
with
clothes
all
rent
and
mouldered
and
herseemed
he
bespoke
her
thus
lisabetta
thou
dost
nought
but
call
upon
me
grieving
for
my
long
delay
and
cruelly
impeaching
me
with
thy
tears
know
therefore
that
i
may
never
more
return
to
thee
for
that
the
last
day
thou
sawest
me
thy
brothers
slew
me
then
having
discovered
to
her
the
place
where
they
had
buried
him
he
charged
her
no
more
call
him
nor
expect
him
and
disappeared
whereupon
she
awoke
and
giving
faith
to
the
vision
wept
bitterly
in
the
morning
being
risen
and
daring
not
say
aught
to
her
brothers
she
determined
to
go
to
the
place
appointed
and
see
if
the
thing
were
true
as
it
had
appeared
to
her
in
the
dream
accordingly
having
leave
to
go
somedele
without
the
city
for
her
disport
she
betook
herself
thither
as
quickliest
she
might
in
company
of
one
who
had
been
with
them
otherwhiles
and
knew
all
her
affairs
and
there
clearing
away
the
dead
leaves
from
the
place
she
dug
whereas
herseemed
the
earth
was
less
hard
she
had
not
dug
long
before
she
found
the
body
of
her
unhappy
lover
yet
nothing
changed
nor
rotted
and
thence
knew
manifestly
that
her
vision
was
true
wherefore
she
was
the
most
distressful
of
women
yet
knowing
that
this
was
no
place
for
lament
she
would
fain
an
she
but
might
have
borne
away
the
whole
body
to
give
it
fitter
burial
but
seeing
that
this
might
not
be
she
with
a
knife
did
off
the
head
from
the
body
as
best
she
could
and
wrapping
it
in
a
napkin
laid
it
in
her
maid
lap
then
casting
back
the
earth
over
the
trunk
she
departed
thence
without
being
seen
of
any
and
returned
home
where
shutting
herself
in
her
chamber
with
her
lover
head
she
bewept
it
long
and
bitterly
insomuch
that
she
bathed
it
all
with
her
tears
and
kissed
it
a
thousand
times
in
every
part
then
taking
a
great
and
goodly
pot
of
those
wherein
they
plant
marjoram
or
sweet
basil
she
set
the
head
therein
folded
in
a
fair
linen
cloth
and
covered
it
with
earth
in
which
she
planted
sundry
heads
of
right
fair
basil
of
salerno
nor
did
she
ever
water
these
with
other
water
than
that
of
her
tears
or
rose
or
water
moreover
she
took
wont
to
sit
still
near
the
pot
and
to
gaze
amorously
upon
it
with
all
her
desire
as
upon
that
which
held
her
lorenzo
hid
and
after
she
had
a
great
while
looked
thereon
she
would
bend
over
it
and
fall
to
weeping
so
sore
and
so
long
that
her
tears
bathed
all
the
basil
which
by
dint
of
long
and
assiduous
tending
as
well
as
by
reason
of
the
fatness
of
the
earth
proceeding
from
the
rotting
head
that
was
therein
waxed
passing
fair
and
very
sweet

savour

sundry
times

to

at
her
waste
beauty
and
that
her

seemed
to
have
fled
forth
her
head
for
weeping

this

have
noted
that
she
doth
every
day
after
such
a
fashion
the
brothers
hearing
and
seeing
this
and
having
once
and
again
reproved
her
therefor
but
without
avail
let
secretly
carry
away
from
her
the
pot
which
she
missing
with
the
utmost
instance
many
a
time
required
and
for
that
it
was
not
restored
to
her
stinted
not
to
weep
and
lament
till
she
fell
sick
nor
in
her
sickness
did
she
ask
aught
other
than
the
pot
of
basil
the
young
men
marvelled
greatly
at
this
continual
asking
and
bethought
them
therefor
to
see
what
was
in
this
pot
accordingly
turning
out
the
earth
they
found
the
cloth
and
therein
the
head
not
yet
so
rotted
but
they
might
know
it
by
the
curled
hair
to
be
that
of
lorenzo
at
this
they
were
mightily
amazed
and
feared
lest
the
thing
should
get
wind
wherefore
burying
the
head
without
word
said
they
privily
departed
messina
having
taken
order
how
they
should
withdraw
thence
and
betook
themselves
to
naples
the
damsel
ceasing
never
from
lamenting
and
still
demanding
her
pot
died
weeping
and
so
her
love
had
end
but
after
a
while
the
thing
being
grown
manifest
unto
many
there
was
one
who
made
thereon
the

that

wherein
is

mention
of
two
dreams
which
were
of
a
thing
to
come
even
as
the
former
was
of
a
thing
already
betided
and
scarce
were
they
finished
telling
by
those
who
had
dreamt
them
than
the
accomplishment
followed
of
both
you
must
know
then
lovesome
ladies
that
it
is
an
affection
common
to
all
alive
to
see
various
things
in
sleep
whereof
albeit
to
the
sleeper
what
while
he
sleepeth
they
all
appear
most
true
and
he
awakened
accounteth
some
true
others
probable
and
yet
others
out
of
all
likelihood
many
are
natheless
found
to
be
come
to
pass
by
reason
whereof
many
lend
to
every
dream
as
much
belief
as
they
would
to
things
they
should
see
waking
and
for
their
proper
dreams
they
sorrow
or
rejoice
according
as
by
these
they
hope
or
fear
and
contrariwise
there
are
those
who
believe
none
thereof
save
after
they
find
themselves
fallen
into
the
peril
foreshown
of
these
i
approve
neither
the
one
nor
other
for
that
dreams
are
neither
always
true
nor
always
false
that
they
are
not
all
true
each
one
of
us
must
often
enough
have
had
occasion
to
know
and
that
they
are
not
all
false
hath
been
already
shown
in
filomena
her
story
and
i
also
purpose
as
i
said
before
to
show
it
in
mine
wherefore
i
am
of
opinion
that
in
the
matter
of
living
and
doing
virtuously
one
should
have
no
fear
of
any
dream
contrary
thereto
nor
forego
good
intentions
by
reason
thereof
as
for
perverse
and
wicked
things
on
the
other
hand
however
favourable
dreams
may
appear
thereto
and
how
much
soever
they
may
hearten
him
who
seeth
them
with
propitious
auguries
none
of
them
should
be
credited
whilst
full
faith
should
be
accorded
unto
all
that
tend
to
the
contrary
but
to
come
to
the
story
footnote
these
two
classes
of
folk
footnote
to
the
encouragement
of
good
and
virtuous
actions
and
purposes
there
was
once
in
the
city
of
brescia
a
gentleman
called
messer
negro
da
ponte
carraro
who
amongst
sundry
other
children
had
a
daughter
named
andrevuola
young
and
unmarried
and
very
fair
it
chanced
she
fell
in
love
with
a
neighbour
of
hers
gabriotto
by
name
a
man
of
mean
condition
but
full
laudable
fashions
and
comely
and
pleasant
of
his
person
and
by
the
means
and
with
the
aid
of
the
of
the
house
she
so
wrought
that
not
only
did
gabriotto
know
himself
beloved
of
her
but
was
many
and
many
a
time
brought
to
the
delight
of
both
parties
into
a
goodly
garden
of
her
father
and
in
order
that
no
cause
other
than
death
should
ever
avail
to
sever
those
their
delightsome
loves
they
became
in
secret
husband
and
wife
and
so
stealthily
continuing
their
foregatherings
it
befell
that
the
young
lady
being
one
night
asleep
dreamt
that
she
was
in
her
garden
with
gabriotto
and
held
him
in
her
arms
to
the
exceeding
pleasure
of
each
but
as
they
abode
thus
herseemed
she
saw
come
forth
of
his
body
something
dark
and
frightful
the
form
whereof
she
could
not
discern
the
which
took
gabriotto
and
tearing
him
in
her
despite
with
marvellous
might
from
her
embrace
made
off
with
him
underground
nor
ever
more
might
she
avail
to
see
either
the
one
or
the
other
at
this
she
fell
into
an
inexpressible
passion
of
grief
whereby
she
awoke
and
albeit
awaking
she
was
rejoiced
to
find
that
it
was
not
as
she
had
dreamed
nevertheless
fear
entered
into
her
by
reason
of
the
dream
she
had
seen
wherefore
gabriotto
presently
desiring
to
visit
her
that
next
night
she
studied
as
most
she
might
to
prevent
his
coming
however
seeing
his
desire
and
so
he
might
not
misdoubt
him
of
otherwhat
she
received
him
in
the
garden
and
having
gathered
great
store
of
roses
white
and
red
for
that
it
was
the
season
she
went
to
sit
with
him
at
the
foot
of
a
very
goodly
and
clear
fountain
that
was
there
after
they
had
taken
great
and
long
delight
together
gabriotto
asked
her
why
she
would
have
forbidden
his
coming
that
night
whereupon
she
told
him
recounting
to
him
the
dream
she
had
seen
the
foregoing
night
and
the
fear
she
had
gotten
therefrom
he
hearing
this
laughed
it
to
scorn
and
said
that
it
was
great
folly
to
put
any
faith
in
dreams
for
that
they
arose
of
excess
of
food
or
lack
thereof
and
were
daily
seen
to
be
all
vain
adding
i
minded
to
follow
after
dreams
i
had
not
come
hither
not
so
much
on
account
of
this
of
thine
as
of
one
i
myself
dreamt
last
night
which
was
that
meseemed
i
was
in
a
fair
and
delightsome
wood
wherein
i
went
hunting
and
had
taken
the
fairest
and
loveliest
hind
was
ever
seen
for
methought
she
was
whiter
than
snow
and
was
in
brief
space
become
so
familiar
with
me
that
she
never
left
me
a
moment
moreover
meseemed
i
held
her
so
dear
that
so
she
might
not
depart
from
me
i
had
put
a
collar
of
gold
about
her
neck
and
held
her
in
hand
with
a
golden
chain
after
this
medreamed
that
once
upon
a
time
what
while
this
hind
lay
couched
with
its
head
in
my
bosom
there
issued
i
know
not
whence
a
greyhound
bitch
as
black
as
coal
anhungred
and
passing
gruesome
of
aspect
and
made
towards
me
methought
i
offered
it
no
resistance
wherefore
meseemed
it
thrust
its
muzzle
into
my
breast
on
the
left
side
and
gnawed
thereat
till
it
won
to
my
heart
which
methought
it
tore
from
me
to
carry
it
away
therewith
i
felt
such
a
pain
that
my
sleep
was
broken
and
awaking
i
straightway
clapped
my
hand
to
my
side
to
see
if
i
had
aught
there
but
finding
nothing
amiss
with
me
i
made
mock
of
myself
for
having
sought
but
after
all
what
booteth
this
dream
i
have
dreamed
many
such
and
far
more
frightful
nor
hath
aught
in
the
world
befallen
me
by
reason
thereof
wherefore
let
it
pass
and
let
us
think
to
give
ourselves
a
good
time

the
young
lady
already
sore
adread
for
her
own
dream
hearing
this
waxed
yet
more
so
but
hid
her
fear
as
most
she
might
not
to
be
the
occasion
of
any
unease
to
gabriotto
nevertheless
what
while
she
solaced
herself
with
him
clipping
and
kissing
him
again
and
again
and
being
of
him
clipped
and
kissed
she
many
a
time
eyed
him
in
the
face
more
than
of
her
wont
misdoubting
she
knew
not
what
and
whiles
she
looked
about
the
garden
and
she
should
see
aught
of
black
come

presently
as
they
abode
thus
gabriotto
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
embracing
her
said
my
soul
help
me
for
i
die
so
saying
he
fell
to
the
ground
upon
the
grass
of
the
lawn
the
young
lady
seeing
this
drew
him
up
into
her
lap
and
said
well
nigh
weeping
sweet
my
lord
what
aileth
thee
he
answered
not
but
panting
sore
and
sweating
all
over
no
great
while
after
departed
this
life
how
grievous
how
dolorous
was
this
to
the
young
lady
who
loved
him
more
than
her
life
each
one
of
you
may
conceive
for
herself
she
bewept
him
sore
and
many
a
time
called
him
in
vain
but
after
she
had
handled
him
in
every
part
of
his
body
and
found
him
cold
in
all
perceiving
that
he
was
altogether
dead
and
knowing
not
what
to
do
or
to
say
she
went
all
tearful
as
she
was
and
full
of
anguish
to
call
her
maid
who
was
privy
to
their
loves
and
discovered
to
her
misery
and
her
grief
then
after
they
had
awhile
made
woeful
lamentation
over
gabriotto
dead
face
the
young
lady
said
to
the
maid
god
hath
bereft
me
of
him
i
love
i
purpose
to
abide
no
longer
on
life
but
ere
i
go
about
to
slay
myself
i
would
fain
take
fitting
means
to
preserve
my
honour
and
the
secret
of
the
love
that
hath
been
between
us
twain
and
that
the
body
wherefrom
the
gracious
spirit
is
departed
may
be
buried
mine
answered
the
maid
not
of
seeking
to
slay
thyself
for
that
if
thou
have
lost
him
in
this
world
by
slaying
thyself
thou
wouldst
lose
him
in
the
world
to
come
also
since
thou
wouldst
go
to
hell
whither
i
am
assured
his
soul
hath
not
gone
for
he
was
a
virtuous
youth
it
were
better
far
to
comfort
thyself
and
think
of
succouring
his
soul
with
prayers
and
other
good
works
so
haply
he
have
need
thereof
for
any
sin
committed
the
means
of
burying
him
are
here
at
hand
in
this
garden
and
none
will
ever
know
of
the
matter
for
none
knoweth
that
he
ever
came
hither
or
an
thou
wilt
not
have
it
so
let
us
put
him
forth
of
the
garden
and
leave
him
be
he
will
be
found
morning
and
carried
to
his
house
where
his
kinsfolk
will
have
him
buried
the
young
lady
albeit
she
was
full
of
bitter
sorrow
and
wept
without
ceasing
yet
gave
ear
to
her
counsels
and
consenting
not
to
the
first
part
thereof
made
answer
to
the
second
saying
forbid
that
i
should
suffer
so
dear
a
youth
and
one
so
beloved
of
me
and
my
husband
to
be
buried
after
the
fashion
of
a
dog
or
left
to
lie
in
the
street
he
hath
had
my
tears
and
inasmuch
as
i
may
he
shall
have
those
of
his
kinsfolk
and
i
have
already
bethought
me
of
that
which
we
have
to
do
to
that
end
therewith
she
despatched
her
maid
for
a
piece
of
cloth
of
silk
which
she
had
in
a
coffer
of
hers
and
spreading
it
on
the
earth
laid
gabriotto
body
thereon
with
his
head
upon
a
pillow
then
with
many
tears
she
closed
his
eyes
and
mouth
and
weaving
him
a
chaplet
of
roses
covered
him
with
all
they
had
gathered
he
and
she
after
which
she
said
to
the
maid
is
but
a
little
way
hence
to
his
house
wherefore
we
will
carry
him
thither
thou
and
i
even
as
we
have
arrayed
him
and
lay
him
before
the
door
it
will
not
be
long
ere
it
be
day
and
he
will
be
taken
up
and
although
this
may
be
no
consolation
to
his
friends
yet
to
me
in
whose
arms
he
died
it
will
be
a
pleasure
so
saying
once
more
with
most
abundant
tears
she
cast
herself
upon
his
face
and
wept
a
great
while
then
being
urged
by
her
maid
to
despatch
for
that
the
day
was
at
hand
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
drawing
from
her
finger
the
ring
wherewith
gabriotto
had
espoused
her
she
set
it
on
his
and
said
weeping
my
lord
if
thy
soul
now
seeth
my
tears
or
if
any
sense
or
cognizance
abide
in
the
body
after
the
departure
thereof
benignly
receive
her
last
gift
whom
living
thou
lovedst
so
well
this
said
she
fell
down
upon
him
in
a
swoon
but
presently
coming
to
herself
and
rising
she
took
up
together
with
her
maid
the
cloth
whereon
the
body
lay
and
going
forth
the
garden
therewith
made
for
his
house
as
they
went
they
were
discovered
and
taken
with
the
dead
body
by
the
officers
of
the
provostry
who
chanced
to
be
abroad
at
that
hour
about
some
other
matter
andrevuola
more
desirous
of
death
than
of
life
recognizing
the
officers
said
frankly
know
who
you
are
and
that
it
would
avail
me
nothing
to
seek
to
flee
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
before
the
seignory
and
there
declare
how
the
case
standeth
but
let
none
of
you
dare
to
touch
me
provided
i
am
obedient
to
you
or
to
remove
aught
from
this
body
an
he
would
not
be
accused
of
me
accordingly
without
being
touched
of
any
she
repaired
with
gabriotto
body
to
the
palace
where
the
provost
hearing
what
was
to
do
arose
and
sending
for
her
into
his
chamber
proceeded
to
enquire
of
this
that
had
happened
to
this
end
he
caused
divers
physicians
look
if
the
dead
man
had
been
done
to
death
with
poison
or
otherwise
who
all
affirmed
that
it
was
not
so
but
that
some
imposthume
had
burst
near
the
heart
the
which
had
suffocated
him
the
magistrate
hearing
this
and
feeling
her
to
be
guilty
in
but
a
small
matter
studied
to
make
a
show
of
giving
her
that
which
he
could
not
sell
her
and
told
her
that
an
she
would
consent
to
his
pleasures
he
would
release
her
but
these
words
availing
not
he
offered
out
of
all
seemliness
to
use
force
however
andrevuola
fired
with
disdain
and
waxed
strong
for
indignation
defended
herself
manfully
rebutting
him
with
proud
and
scornful
words
meanwhile
broad
day

this
if

in

yet
in

will
appear
from
my
story
with
which
it
pleaseth
me
to

this
day
discoursing
diversely
of
divers
things
and
ranging
over
various
parts
of
the
world
we
have
so
far
departed
there
was
then
no
great
while
ago
in
florence
a
damsel
very
handsome
and
agreeable
according
to
her
condition
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
father
and
was
called
simona
and
although
it
behoved
her
with
her
own
hands
earn
the
bread
she
would
eat
and
sustain
her
life
by
spinning
wool
she
was
not
therefor
of
so
poor
a
spirit
but
that
she
dared
to
admit
into
her
heart
love
which
by
means
of
the
pleasing
words
and
fashions
of
a
youth
of
no
greater
account
than
herself
who
went
giving
wool
to
spin
for
a
master
of
his
a
had
long
made
a
show
of
wishing
to
enter
there
having
then
received
him
into
her
bosom
with
the
pleasing
aspect
of
the
youth
who
loved
her
whose
name
was
pasquino
she
heaved
a
thousand
sighs
hotter
than
fire
at
every
hank
of
yarn
she
wound
about
the
spindle
bethinking
her
of
him
who
had
given
it
her
to
spin
and
ardently
desiring
but
venturing
not
to
do
more
he
on
his
side
grown
exceeding
anxious
that
his
master
wool
should
be
well
spun
overlooked
simona
spinning
more
diligently
than
that
of
any
other
as
if
the
yarn
spun
by
her
alone
and
none
other
were
to
furnish
forth
the
whole
cloth
wherefore
the
one
soliciting
and
the
other
delighting
to
be
solicited
it
befell
that
he
growing
bolder
than
of
his
wont
and
she
laying
aside
much
of
the
timidity
and
shamefastness
she
was
used
to
feel
they
gave
themselves
up
with
a
common
accord
to
mutual
pleasures
which
were
so
pleasing
to
both
that
not
only
did
neither
wait
to
be
bidden
thereto
of
the
other
but
each
forewent
other
in
the
matter
of
invitation
ensuing
this
their
delight
from
day
to
day
and
waxing
ever
more
enkindled
for
continuance
it
chanced
one
day
that
pasquino
told
simona
he
would
fain
have
her
find
means
to
come
to
a
garden
whither
he
wished
to
carry
her
so
they
might
there
foregather
more
at
their
ease
and
with
less
suspect
simona
answered
that
she
would
well
and
accordingly
on
sunday
after
eating
giving
her
father
to
believe
that
she
meant
to
go
to
san
gallo
she
betook
herself
with
a
friend
of
hers
called
lagina
to
the
garden
appointed
her
of
pasquino
there
she
found
him
with
a
comrade
of
his
whose
name
was
puccino
but
who
was
commonly
called
stramba
and
an
amorous
acquaintance
being
quickly
clapped
up
between
the
latter
and
lagina
simona
and
her
lover
withdrew
to
one
part
of
the
garden
to
do
their
pleasure
leaving
stramba
and
lagina
in
another

footnote
now
in
that
part
of
the
garden
whither
pasquino
and
simona
had
betaken
themselves
was
a
very
great
and
goodly
bush
of
sage
at
the
foot
whereof
they
sat
down
and
solaced
themselves
together
a
great
while
holding
much
discourse
of
a
collation
they
purposed
to
make
there
at
their
leisure
presently
pasquino
turned
to
the
great
and
plucking
a
leaf
thereof
began
to
rub
his
teeth
and
gums
withal
avouching
that
sage
cleaned
them
excellent
well
of
aught
that
might
be
left
thereon
after
eating
after
he
had
thus
rubbed
them
awhile
he
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
collation
of
which
he
had
already
spoken
nor
had
he
long
pursued
his
discourse
when
he
began
altogether
to
change
countenance
and
well
nigh
immediately
after
lost
sight
and
speech
and
in
a
little
while
he
died
simona
seeing
this
fell
to
weeping
and
crying
out
and
called
stramba
and
lagina
who
ran
thither
in
haste
and
seeing
pasquino
not
only
dead
but
already
grown
all
swollen
and
full
of
dark
spots
about
his
face
and
body
stramba
cried
out
of
a
sudden
wicked
woman
thou
hast
poisoned
him
making
a
great
outcry
he
was
heard
of
many
who
dwelt
near
the
garden
and
who
running
to
the
clamour
found
pasquino
dead
and
swollen
hearing
stramba
lamenting
and
accusing
simona
of
having
poisoned
him
of
her
malice
whilst
she
for
dolour
of
the
sudden
mishap
that
had
carried
off
her
lover
knew
not
how
to
excuse
herself
being
as
it
were
beside
herself
they
all
concluded
that
it
was
as
he
said
and
accordingly
she
was
taken
and
carried
off
still
weeping
sore
to
the
provost
palace
where
at
the
instance
of
stramba
and
other
two
comrades
of
pasquino
by
name
atticciato
and
malagevole
who
had
come
up
meanwhile
a
judge
addressed
himself
without
delay
to
examine
her
of
the
fact
and
being
unable
to
discover
that
she
had
done
malice
in
the
matter
or
was
anywise
guilty
he
bethought
himself
in
her
presence
to
view
the
dead
body
and
the
place
and
manner
of
the
mishap
as
recounted
to
him
by
her
for
that
he
apprehended
it
not
very
well
by
her
words
accordingly
he
let
bring
her
without
any
stir
whereas
body
lay
yet
swollen
as
it
were
a
tun
and
himself
following
her
thither
marvelled
at
the
dead
man
and
asked
her
how
it
had
been
whereupon
going
up
to
the
she
recounted
to
him
all
the
foregoing
story
and
to
give
him
more
fully
to
understand
how
the
thing
had
befallen
she
did
even
as
pasquino
had
done
and
rubbed
one
of
the
against
her
teeth
then
whilst
her
words
were
in
the
judge
presence
flouted
by
stramba
and
atticciato
and
the
other
friends
and
comrades
of
pasquino
as
frivolous
and
vain
and
they
all
denounced
her
wickedness
with
the
more
instance
demanding
nothing
less
than
that
the
fire
should
be
the
punishment
of
such
perversity
the
wretched
girl
who
abode
all
confounded
for
dolour
of
her
lost
lover
and
fear
of
the
punishment
demanded
by
stramba
fell
for
having
rubbed
the
sage
against
her
teeth
into
that
same
mischance
whereinto
her
lover
had
fallen
and
dropped
dead
to
the
no
small
wonderment
of
as
many
as
were
present

happy
souls
to
whom
it
fell
in

day

innocence

of

her
a
more
honourable
way

unto
that
of

lover
to
deliver
herself
from
their
calumnies
and
to
follow
the
soul
so
dearly
loved
of
her
of
her
pasquino
the
judge
in
a
manner
astonied
as
were
likewise
as
many
as
were
there
at
this
mischance
and
unknowing
what
to
say
abode
long
silent
then
recollecting
himself
he
said
seemeth
this
sage
is
poisonous
the
which
is
not

to
happen

so
it
may
not

down

to
the
roots

cast
into

fire

the
keeper
of

garden
proceeded
to
do
in
the
judge
presence
and
no
sooner
had
he
levelled
the
great
bush
with
the
ground
than
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
two
unfortunate
lovers
appeared
for
thereunder
was
a
toad
of
marvellous
bigness
by
whose
pestiferous
breath
they
concluded
the
sage
to
have
become
venomous
none
daring
approach
the
beast

made
a
great
hedge
of
brushwood
about
it

began
thus
there
are
some
noble
ladies
who
believe
themselves
to
know
more
than
other
folk
albeit
to
my
thinking
they
know
less
and
who
by
reason
thereof
presume
to
oppose
their
judgment
not
only
to
the
counsels
of
men
but
even
to
set
it
up
against
the
very
nature
of
things
of
which
presumption
very
grave
ills
have
befallen
aforetime
nor
ever
was
any
good
known
to
come
thereof

for
that
of
all

that
which

brooketh

is
such
that

itself

it
hath
come
to
my
mind
to
narrate
to
you
a
story
of
a
lady
who
seeking

be
wiser

pertained
unto
her
and
than
she
was
nay
than
the
matter
comported
in
which
she
studied
to
show
her
wit
thought
to
tear
out
from
an
enamoured
heart
a
love
which
had
belike
been
set
there
of
the
stars
and
so
doing
succeeded
in
expelling
at
once
love
and
life
from
her
son
body
there
was
then
in
our
city
according
to
that
which
the
ancients
relate
a
very
great
and
rich
merchant
whose
name
was
lionardo
sighieri
and
who
had
by
his
wife
a
son
called
girolamo
after
whose
birth
having
duly
set
his
affairs
in
order
he
departed
this
life
the
guardians
of
the
boy
together
with
his
mother
well
and
loyally
ordered
his
affairs
and
he
growing
up
with
his
neighbour
children
became
familiar
with
a
girl
of
his
own
age
the
daughter
of
the
tailor

than
with
any
other
of
the
quarter

he
waxed
in

turned
to
love
so
great

so
ardent
that

was

loved
him

was
loved

observing
this
many
a
time
chid
and
rebuked
him
therefor
and
after
girolamo
availing
not
to
desist
therefrom
complained
thereof
to
his

to
them

neighbour
by
name
salvestra
that
except
we
remove
her
from
his
sight
he
will
peradventure
one
day
take
her
to
wife
without
any
one
knowledge
and
i
shall
never
after
be
glad
or
else
he
will
pine
away
from
her
if
he
see
her
married
to
another
wherefore
meseemeth
to
avoid
this
you
were
best
send
him
somewhither
far
from
here
about
the
business
of
the
warehouse
for
that
he
being
removed
from
seeing
her
she
will
pass
out
of
his
mind
and
we
may
after
avail
to
give
him
some
damsel
to
wife
the
guardians
answered
that
the
lady
said
well
and
that
they
would
do
this
to
the
best
of
their
power
wherefore
calling
the
boy
into
the
warehouse
one
of
them
began
very
lovingly
to
bespeak
him
thus
son
thou
art
now
somewhat
waxen
in
years
and
it
were
well
that
thou
shouldst
begin
to
look
for
thyself
to
thine
affairs
wherefore
it
would
much
content
us
that
thou
shouldst
go
sojourn
awhile
at
paris
where
thou
wilt
see
how
great
part
of
thy
wealth
is
employed
more
by
token
that
thou
wilt
there
become
far
better
bred
and
mannered
and
more
of
worth
than
thou
couldst
here
seeing
the
lords
and
barons
and
gentlemen
who
are
there
in
plenty
and
learning
their
usances
after
which
thou
mayst
return
hither
the
youth
hearkened
diligently
and
answered
curtly
that
he
was
nowise
disposed
to
do
this
for
that
he
believed
himself
able
to
fare
as
well
at
florence
as
another
the
worthy
men
hearing
this
essayed
him
again
with
sundry
discourse
but
failing
to
get
other
answer
of
him
told
his
mother
who
sore
provoked
thereat
gave
him
a
sound
rating
not
because
of
his
unwillingness
to
go
to
paris
but
of
his
enamourment
after
which
she
fell
to
cajoling
him
with
fair
words
coaxing
him
and
praying
him
softly
be
pleased
to
do
what
his
guardians
wished
brief
she
contrived
to
bespeak
him
to
such
purpose
that
he
consented
to
go
to
france
and
there
abide
a
year
and
no
more
accordingly
ardently
enamoured
as
he
was
he
betook
himself
to
paris
and
there
being
still
put
off
from
one
day
to
another
he
was
kept
two
years
at
the
end
of
which
time
returning
more
in
love
than
ever
he
found
his
salvestra
married
to
an
honest
youth
a
tent
maker
at
this
he
was
beyond
measure
woebegone
but
seeing
no
help
for
it
he
studied
to
console
himself
therefor
and
having
spied
out
where
she
dwelt
began
after
the
wont
of
young
men
in
love
to
pass
before
her
expecting
she
should
no
more
have
forgotten
him
than
he
her
but
the
case
was
otherwise
she
had
no
more
remembrance
of
him
than
if
she
had
never
seen
him
or
if
indeed
she
remembered
aught
of
him
she
feigned
the
contrary
and
of
this
in
a
very
brief
space
of
time
girolamo
became
aware
to
his
no
small
chagrin
nevertheless
he
did
all
he
might
to
bring
himself
to
her
mind
but
himseeming
he
wrought
nothing
he
resolved
to
speak
with
her
face
to
face
though
he
should
die
for
it
accordingly
having
learned
from
a
neighbour
how
her
house
stood
one
evening
that
she
and
her
husband
were
gone
to
keep
wake
with
their
neighbours
he
entered
therein
by
stealth
and
hiding
himself
behind
certain
tent
cloths
that
were
spread
there
waited
till
the
twain
having
returned
and
gotten
them
to
bed
he
knew
her
husband
to
be
asleep
whereupon
he
came
whereas
he
had
seen
salvestra
lay
herself
and
putting
his
hand
upon
her
breast
said
softly
thou
yet
o
my
soul
the
girl
who
was
awake
would
have
cried
out
but
he
said
hastily
god
sake
cry
not
for
i
am
thy
girolamo
she
hearing
this
said
all
trembling
for
god
sake
girolamo
get
thee
gone
the
time
is
past
when
it
was
not
forbidden
unto
our
childishness
to
be
lovers
i
am
as
thou
seest
married
and
it
beseemeth
me
no
more
to
have
regard
to
any
man
other
than
my
husband
wherefore
i
beseech
thee
by
god
the
only
to
begone
for
that
if
my
husband
heard
thee
even
should
no
other
harm
ensue
thereof
yet
would
it
follow
that
i
might
never
more
avail
to
live
with
him
in
peace
or
quiet
whereas
now
i
am
beloved
of
him
and
abide
with
him
in
weal
and
in
tranquility
the
youth
hearing
these
words
was
grievously
endoloured
and
recalled
to
her
the
time
past
and
his
love
no
whit
grown
less
for
absence
mingling
many
prayers
and
many
great
promises
but
obtained
nothing
wherefore
desiring
to
die
he
prayed
her
at
last
that
in
requital
of
so
much
love
she
would
suffer
him
couch
by
her
side
so
he
might
warm
himself
somewhat
for
that
he
was
grown
chilled
awaiting
her
promising
her
that
he
would
neither
say
aught
to
her
nor
touch
her
and
would
get
him
gone
so
soon
as
he
should
be
a
little
warmed
salvestra
having
some
little
compassion
of
him
granted
him
this
he
asked
upon
the
conditions
aforesaid
and
he
accordingly
lay
down
beside
her
without
touching
her
then
collecting
into
one
thought
the
long
love
he
had
borne
her
and
her
present
cruelty
and
his
lost
hope
he
resolved
to
live
no
longer
wherefore
straitening
in
himself
his
vital
spirits
he
clenched
his
hands
and
died
by
her
side
without
word
or
motion

an
obscure
passage
perhaps
holding
his
breath
is
meant
but
in
this
case
we
should
read
instead
of
after
a
while
the
young
woman
marvelling
at
his
continence
and
fearing
lest
her
husband
should
awake
began
to
say
girolamo
why
dost
thou
not
get
thee
gone
hearing
no
answer
she
concluded
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
putting
out
her
hand
to
awaken
him
found
him
cold
to
the
touch
as
ice
whereat
she
marvelled
sore
then
nudging
him
more
sharply
and
finding
that
he
stirred
not
she
felt
him
again
and
knew
that
he
was
dead
whereat
she
was
beyond
measure
woebegone
and
abode
a
great
while
unknowing
what
she
should
do
at
last
she
bethought
herself
to
try
in
the
person
of
another
what
her
husband
should
say
was
to
do
in
such
a
case
wherefore
awakening
him
she
told
him
as
having
happened
to
another
that
which
had
presently
betided
herself
and
after
asked
him
what
counsel
she
should
take
thereof
if
it
should
happen
to
herself
the
good
man
replied
that
himseemed
the
dead
man
should
be
quietly
carried
to
his
house
and
there
left
without
bearing
any
ill
will
thereof
to
the
woman
who
it
appeared
to
him
had
nowise
done
amiss
then
said
salvestra
so
it
behoveth
us
do
and
taking
his
hand
made
him
touch
the
dead
youth
whereupon
all
confounded
he
arose
without
entering
into
farther
parley
with
his
wife
and
kindled
a
light
then
clothing
the
dead
body
in
its
own
garments
he
took
it
without
any
delay
on
his
shoulders
and
carried
it
his
innocence
aiding
him
to
the
door
of
girolamo
house
where
he
set
it
down
and
left
it
footnote
what
course
she
should
take
in

matter

and
in
this
special
sense
when
the
day
came
and
girolamo
was
found
dead
before
his
own
door
great
was
outcry
especially
on
the
part
of
his
mother
and
the
physicians
having
examined
him
and
searched
his
body
everywhere
but
finding
no
wound
nor
bruise
whatsoever
on
him
it
was
generally
concluded
that
he
had
died
of
grief
as
was
indeed
the
case
then
was
the
body
carried
into
a
church
and
the
sad
mother
repairing
thither
with
many
other
ladies
kinswomen
and
neighbours
began
to
weep
without
stint
and
make
sore
moan
over
him
according
to
our
usance
what
while
the
lamentation
was
at
it
highest
the
good
man
in
whose
house
he
had
died
said
to
salvestra
put
some
mantlet
or
other
on
thy
head
and
get
thee
to
the
church
whither
girolamo
hath
been
carried
and
mingle
with
the
women
and
hearken
to
that
which
is
discoursed
of
the
matter
and
i
will
do
the
like
among
the
men
so
we
may
hear
if
aught
be
said
against
us
the
thing
pleased
the
girl
who
was
too
late
grown
pitiful
and
would
fain
look
upon
him
dead
whom
living
she
had
not
willed
to
pleasure
with
one
poor
kiss
and
she
went
thither
a
marvellous
thing
it
is
to
think
how
uneath

out
are
the
ways
of
love
that
heart

girolamo
fair
fortune
had
not

to
open

illhap

and
the
old
flames
reviving
all
therein
whenas
she
saw
the
dead
face
it
melted
of
a
sudden
into
such
compassion
that
she
pressed
between
the
women
veiled
as
she
was
in
the
mantlet
and
stayed
not
till
she
won
to
the
body
and
there
giving
a
terrible
great
shriek
she
cast
herself
face
downward
on
the
dead
youth
whom
she
bathed
not
with
many
tears
for
that
no
sooner
did
she
touch
him
than
grief
bereaved
her
of

as
it
had
bereft
him

her
heart
the
women
would
have
comforted
her
and
bidden
her
arise
not
yet
knowing
her
but
after
they
had
bespoken
her
awhile
in
vain
they
sought
to
lift
her
and
finding
her
motionless
raised
her
up
and
knew
her
at
once
for
salvestra
and
for
dead
whereupon
all
who
were
there
overcome
with
double
pity
set
up
a
yet
greater
clamour
of
lamentation
the
news
soon
spread
abroad
among
the
men
without
the
church
and
came
presently
to
the
ears
of
her
husband
who
was
amongst
them
and
who
without
lending
ear
to
consolation
or
comfort
from
any
wept
a
great
while
after
which
he
recounted
to
many
of
those
who
were
there
the
story
of
that
which
had
befallen
that
night
between
the
dead
youth
and

laid

was
the
mishap
that
befell
them
you
must
know
then
that
according
to
that
which
the
proven√ßals
relate
there
were
aforetime
in
provence
two
noble
knights
each
of
whom
had
castles
and
vassals
under
him
called
the
one
sir
guillaume
de
roussillon
and
the
other
sir
guillaume
de
guardestaing
and
for
that
they
were
both
men
of
great
prowess
in
arms
they
loved
each
other
with
an
exceeding
love
and
were
wont
to
go
still
together
and
clad
in
the
same
colours
to
every
tournament
or
jousting
or
other
act
of
arms
although
they
abode
each
in
his
own
castle
and
were
distant
one
from
other
a
good
half
score
miles
yet
it
came
to
pass
that
sir
guillaume
de
roussillon
having
a
very
fair
and
lovesome
lady
to
wife
sir
guillaume
de
guardestaing
notwithstanding
the
friendship
and
fellowship
that
was
between
them
become
beyond
measure
enamoured
of
her
and
so
wrought
now
with
one
means
and
now
with
another
that
the
lady
became
aware
of
his
passion
and
knowing
him
for
a
very
valiant
knight
it
pleased
her
and
she
began
to
return
his
love
insomuch
that
she
desired
and
tendered
nothing
more
than
him
nor
awaited
otherwhat
than
to
be
solicited
of
him
the
which
was
not
long
in
coming
to
pass
and
they
foregathered
once
and
again
loving
each
other
amain
and
conversing
together
less
discreetly
than
behoved
it
befell
that
the
husband
became
aware
of
their
familiarity
and
was
mightily
incensed
thereat
insomuch
that
the
great
love
he
bore
to
guardestaing
was
turned
into
mortal
hatred
but
this
he
knew
better
to
keep
hidden
than
the
two
lovers
had
known
to
conceal
their
love
and
was
fully
resolved
in
himself
to
kill
him
roussillon
being
in
this
mind
it
befell
that
a
great
tourneying
was
proclaimed
in
france
the
which
he
forthright
signified
to
guardestaing
and
sent
to
bid
him
come
to
him
an
it
pleased
him
so
they
might
take
counsel
together
if
and
how
they
should
go
thither
whereto
the
other
very
joyously
answered
that
he
would
without
fail
come
to
sup
with
him
on
the
ensuing
day
roussillon
hearing
this
thought
the
time
come
whenas
he
might
avail
to
kill
him
and
accordingly
on
the
morrow
he
armed
himself
and
mounting
to
horse
with
a
servant
of
his
lay
at
ambush
maybe
a
mile
from
his
castle
in
a
wood
whereas
guardestaing
must
pass
there
after
he
had
awaited
him
a
good
while
he
saw
him
come
unarmed
and
followed
by
two
servants
in
like
case
as
one
who
apprehends
nothing
from
him
and
when
he
saw
him
come
whereas
he
would
have
him
he
rushed
out
upon
him
lance
in
hand
full
of
rage
and
malice
crying
thou
art
dead
and
to
say
thus
and
to
plunge
the
lance
into
his
breast
were
one
and
the
same
thing
guardestaing
without
being
able
to
make
any
defence
or
even
to
say
a
word
fell
from
his
horse
transfixed
of
the
lance
and
a
little
after
died
whilst
his
servants
without
waiting
to
learn
who
had
done
this
turned
their
horses
heads
and
fled
as
quickliest
they
might
towards
their
lord
castle
roussillon
dismounted
and
opening
the
dead
breast
with
a
knife
with
his
own
hands
tore
out
his
heart
which
he
let
wrap
in
the
pennon
of
a
lance
and
gave
to
one
of
his
men
to
carry
then
commanding
that
none
should
dare
make
words
of
the
matter
he
remounted
it
being
now
night
and
returned
to
his
castle
the
lady
who
had
heard
that
guardestaing
was
to
be
there
that
evening
to
supper
and
looked
for
him
with
the
utmost
impatience
seeing
him
not
come
marvelled
sore
and
said
to
her
husband
is
it
sir
that
guardestaing
is
not
come
answered
he
have
had
word
from
him
that
he
can
not
be
here
till
whereat
the
lady
abode
somewhat
troubled
roussillon
then
dismounted
and
calling
the
cook
said
to
him
this
wild
boar
heart
and
look
thou
make
a
dainty
dish
thereof
the
best
and
most
delectable
to
eat
that
thou
knowest
and
when
i
am
at
table
send
it
to
me
in
a
silver
porringer
the
cook
accordingly
took
the
heart
and
putting
all
his
art
thereto
and
all
his
diligence
minced
it
and
seasoning
it
with
store
of
rich
spices
made
of
it
a
very
dainty
ragout
when
it
was
time
sir
guillaume
sat
down
to
table
with
his
wife
and
the
viands
came
but
he
ate
little
being
hindered
in
thought
for
the
ill
deed
he
had
committed
presently
the
cook
sent
him
the

said
to

deem
you

hesitated
awhile

said

have
you
made

you
have
eaten
answered
the

in

truth
the

you
disloyal

as
you

so
loved
and
know
for
certain
that

is
his
very
heart
for
that
i
tore
it
from
his
breast
with
these
hands
a
little
before
my
return
footnote
or
surfeited
it
needeth
not
to
ask
if
the
lady
were
woebegone
hearing
this
of
him
whom
she
loved
more
than
aught
else
and
after
awhile
she
said
have
done
the
deed
of
a
disloyal
and
base
knight
as
you
are
for
if
i
unenforced
of
him
made
him
lord

therein
offended

i
should
have
borne

upon
such
noble
meat
the

so
valiant

so
courteous
a

as
was
sir

rising
to

without

she
let
herself
fall
backward
through
a

was
behind

high

as
she
fell

killed

well

broken

sir

seeing
this
was
sore
dismayed

he
had
done
ill
wherefore
being
adread
of
the
country
people

of
the
count

he
let
saddle
his
horses
and
made
off
on
the
morrow
it
was
known
all
over
the

the

laid

you
must

then
fairest
lasses
that
there
was
in
salerno
no
great
while
since
a
very
famous
doctor
in
surgery
by
name
master
mazzeo
della
montagna
who
being
already
come
to
extreme
old
age
took
to
wife
a
fair
and
gentle
damsel
of
his
city
and
kept
better
furnished
with
sumptuous
and
rich
apparel
and
jewels
and
all
that
can
pleasure
a
lady
than
any
woman
of
the
place
true
it
is
she
went
most
of
her
time
being
kept
of
her
husband
ill
covered
abed
for
like
as
messer
ricardo
di
chinzica
of
whom
we
already
told
taught
his
wife
to
observe
saints
days
and
holidays
even
so
the
doctor
pretended
to
her
that
once
lying
with
a
woman
necessitated
i
know
not
how
many
days
study
to
recruit
the
strength
and
the
like
toys
whereof
she
abode
exceeding
ill
content
and
like
a
discreet
and
woman
as
she
was
bethought
herself
so
she
might
the
better
husband
the
household
good
to
betake
herself
to
the
highway
and
seek
to
spend
others
gear
to
this
end
considering
divers
young
men
at
last
she
found
one
to
her
mind
and
on
him
she
set
all
her
hope
whereof
he
becoming
aware
and
she
pleasing
him
mightily
he
in
like
manner
turned
all
his
love
upon
her
the
spark
in
question
was
called
ruggieri
da
jeroli
a
man
of
noble
birth
but
of
lewd
life
and
blameworthy
carriage
insomuch
that
he
had
left
himself
neither
friend
nor
kinsman
who
wished
him
well
or
cared
to
see
him
and
was
defamed
throughout
all
salerno
for
thefts
and
other
knaveries
of
the
vilest
but
of
this
the
lady
recked
little
he
pleasing
her
for
otherwhat
and
with
the
aid
of
a
maid
of
hers
she
wrought
on
such
wise
that
they
came
together
after
they
had
taken
some
delight
the
lady
proceeded
to
blame
his
past
way
of
life
and
to
pray
him
for
the
love
of
her
to
desist
from
these
ill
fashions
and
to
give
him
the
means
of
doing
this
she
fell
to
succouring
him
now
with
one
sum
of
money
and
now
with
another
on
this
wise
they
abode
together
using
the
utmost
discretion
till
it
befell
that
a
sick
man
was
put
into
the
doctor
hands
who
had
a
gangrened
leg
and
master
mazzeo
having
examined
the
case
told
the
patient
kinsfolk
that
except
a
decayed
bone
he
had
in
his
leg
were
taken
out
needs
must
he
have
the
whole
limb
cut
off
or
die
and
that
by
taking
out
the
bone
he
might
recover
but
that
he
would
not
undertake
him
otherwise
than
for
a
dead
man
to
which
those
to
whom
the
sick
man
pertained
agreed
and
gave
the
latter
into
his
hands
for
such
the
doctor
judging
that
the
patient
might
not
brook
the
pain
nor
would
suffer
himself
to
be
operated
without
an
opiate
and
having
appointed
to
set
about
the
matter
at
evensong
let
that
morning
distil
a
certain
water
of
his
composition
which
being
drunken
by
the
sick
man
should
make
him
sleep
so
long
as
he
deemed
necessary
for
the
performing
of
the
operation
upon
him
and
fetching
it
home
set
it
in
his
chamber
without
telling
any
what
it
was
the
hour
of
vespers
come
and
the
doctor
being
about
to
go
to
the
patient
in
question
there
came
to
him
a
messenger
from
certain
very
great
friends
of
his
at
malfi
charging
him
fail
not
for
anything
to
repair
thither
incontinent
for
that
there
had
been
a
great
fray
there
in
which
many
had
been
wounded
master
mazzeo
accordingly
put
off
the
tending
of
the
leg
until
the
ensuing
morning
and
going
aboard
a
boat
went
off
to
malfi
whereupon
his
wife
knowing
that
he
would
not
return
home
that
night
let
fetch
ruggieri
as
of
her
wont
and
bringing
him
into
her
chamber
locked
him
therewithin
against
certain
other
persons
of
the
house
should
be
gone
to
sleep
ruggieri
then
abiding
in
the
chamber
awaiting
his
mistress
and
being
whether
for
fatigue
endured
that
day
or
salt
meat
that
he
had
eaten
or
maybe
for
usance
sore
athirst
caught
sight
of
the
flagon
of
water
which
the
doctor
had
prepared
for
the
sick
man
and
which
stood
in
the
window
and
deeming
it
drinking
water
set
it
to
his
mouth
and
drank
it
all
off
nor
was
it
long
ere
a
great
drowsiness
took
him
and
he
fell
asleep
the
lady
came
to
the
chamber
as
first
she
might
and
finding
ruggieri
asleep
nudged
him
and
bade
him
in
a
low
voice
arise
but
to
no
effect
for
he
replied
not
neither
stirred
anywhit
whereat
she
was
somewhat
vexed
and
nudged
him
more
sharply
saying
up
slugabed
an
thou
hadst
a
mind
to
sleep
thou
shouldst
have
betaken
thee
to
thine
own
house
and
not
come
hither
ruggieri
being
thus
pushed
fell
to
the
ground
from
a
chest
whereon
he
lay
and
gave
no
more
sign
of
life
than
a
dead
body
whereupon
the
lady
now
somewhat
alarmed
began
to
seek
to
raise
him
up
and
to
shake
him
more
roughly
tweaking
him
by
the
nose
and
plucking
him
by
the
beard
but
all
in
vain
he
had
tied
his
ass
to
a
fast
picket
at
this
she
began
to
fear
lest
he
were
dead
nevertheless
she
proceeded
to
pinch
him
sharply
and
burn
his
flesh
with
a
lighted
taper
but
all
to
no
purpose
wherefore
being
no
doctress
for
all
her
husband
was
a
physician
she
doubted
not
but
he
was
dead
in
very
deed
loving
him
over
all
else
as
she
did
it
needeth
no
asking
if
she
were
woebegone
for
this
and
daring
not
make
any
outcry
she
silently
fell
over
him
and
bewailing
so
sore
a
mishap
footnote
a
proverbial
way
of
saying
that
he
was
fast
asleep
after
awhile
fearing
to
add
shame
to
her
loss
she
bethought
herself
that
it
behoved
her
without
delay
find
a
means
of
carrying
the
dead
man
forth
of
the
house
and
knowing
not
how
to
contrive
this
she
softly
called
her
maid
and
discovering
to
her
her
misadventure
sought
counsel
of
her
the
maid
marvelled
exceedingly
and
herself
pulled
and
pinched
ruggieri
but
finding
him
without
sense
or
motion
agreed
with
her
mistress
that
he
was
certainly
dead
and
counselled
her
put
him
forth
of
the
house
quoth
the
lady
where
can
we
put
him
so
it
may
not
be
suspected
whenas
he
shall
be
seen
morning
that
he
hath
been
brought
out
hence
answered
the
maid
saw
this
evening
at
nightfall
over
against
the
shop
of
our
neighbour
yonder
the
carpenter
a
chest
not
overbig
the
which
an
the
owner
have
not
taken
it
in
again
will
come
very
apt
for
our
affair
for
that
we
can
lay
him
therein
after
giving
him
two
or
three
slashes
with
a
knife
and
leave
him
be
i
know
no
reason
why
whoso
findeth
him
should
suppose
him
to
have
been
put
there
from
this
house
rather
than
otherwhence
nay
it
will
liefer
be
believed
seeing
he
was
a
young
man
of
lewd
life
that
he
hath
been
slain
by
some
enemy
of
his
whilst
going
about
to
do
some
mischief
or
other
and
after
clapped
in
the
chest
the
maid
counsel
pleased
the
lady
save
that
she
would
not
hear
of
giving
him
any
wound
saying
that
for
naught
in
the
world
would
her
heart
suffer
her
to
do
that
accordingly
she
sent
her
to
see
if
the
chest
were
yet
whereas
she
had
noted
it
and
she
presently
returned
and
said
then
being
young
and
lusty
with
the
aid
of
her
mistress
she
took
ruggieri
on
her
shoulders
and
carrying
him
out
whilst
the
lady
forewent
her
to
look
if
any
came
clapped
him
into
the
chest
and
shutting
down
the
lid
left
him
there
now
it
chanced
that
a
day
or
two
before
two
young
men
who
lent
at
usance
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
a
house
a
little
farther
and
lacking
household
gear
but
having
a
mind
to
gain
much
and
spend
little
had
that
day
espied
the
chest
in
question
and
had
plotted
together
if
it
should
abide
there
the
night
to
carry
it
off
to
their
own
house
accordingly
midnight
come
they
sallied
forth
and
finding
the
chest
still
there
without
looking
farther
they
hastily
carried
it
off
for
all
it
seemed
to
them
somewhat
heavy
to
their
own
house
where
they
set
it
down
beside
a
chamber
in
which
their
wives
slept
and
there
leaving
it
without
concerning
themselves
for
the
nonce
to
settle
it
overnicely
betook
them
to
bed
presently
the
morning
drawing
near
ruggieri
who
had
slept
a
great
while
having
by
this
time
digested
the
sleeping
draught
and
exhausted
its
effects
awoke
and
albeit
his
sleep
was
broken
and
his
senses
in
some
measure
restored
there
abode
yet
a
dizziness
in
his
brain
which
held
him
stupefied
not
that
night
only
but
some
days
after
opening
his
eyes
and
seeing
nothing
he
put
out
his
hands
hither
and
thither
and
finding
himself
in
the
chest
bethought
himself
and
said
is
this
where
am
i
am
i
asleep
or
awake
algates
i
mind
me
that
i
came
this
evening
into
my
mistress
chamber
and
now
meseemeth
i
am
in
a
chest
what
meaneth
this
can
the
physician
have
returned
or
other
accident
befallen
by
reason
whereof
the
lady
hath
hidden
me
here
i
being
asleep
methinketh
it
must
have
been
thus
assuredly
it
was
so
accordingly
he
addressed
himself
to
abide
quiet
and
hearken
if
he
could
hear
aught
and
after
he
had
abidden
thus
a
great
while
being
somewhat
ill
at
ease
in
the
chest
which
was
small
and
the
side
whereon
he
lay
irking
him
he
would
have
turned
over
to
the
other
and
wrought
so
dexterously
that
thrusting
his
loins
against
one
of
the
sides
of
the
chest
which
had
not
been
set
on
a
level
place
he
caused
it
first
to
incline
to
one
side
and
after
topple
over
in
falling
it
made
a
great
noise
whereat
the
women
who
slept
therenigh
awoke
and
being
affrighted
were
silent
for
fear
ruggieri
was
sore
alarmed
at
the
fall
of
the
chest
but
finding
that
it
had
opened
in
the
fall
chose
rather
if
aught
else
should
betide
to
be
out
of
it
than
to
abide
therewithin
accordingly
he
came
forth
and
what
with
knowing
not
where
he
was
and
what
with
one
thing
and
another
he
fell
to
groping
about
the
house
so
haply
he
should
find
a
stair
or
a
door
whereby
he
might
get
him
gone
the
women
hearing
this
began
to
say
is
there
but
ruggieri
knowing
not
the
voice
answered
not
whereupon
they
proceeded
to
call
the
two
young
men
who
for
that
they
had
overwatched
themselves
slept
fast
and
heard
nothing
of
all
this
thereupon
the
women
waxing
more
fearful
arose
and
betaking
themselves
to
the
windows
fell
thieves
at
this
sundry
of
the
neighbours
ran
up
and
made
their
way
some
by
the
roof
and
some
by
one
part
and
some
by
another
into
the
house
and
the
young
men
also
awaking
for
the
noise
arose
and
seized
ruggieri
who
finding
himself
there
was
in
a
manner
beside
himself
for
wonderment
and
saw
no
way
of
escape
then
they
gave
him
into
the
hands
of
the
officers
of
the
governor
of
the
city
who
had
now
run
thither
at
the
noise
and
carried
him
before
their
chief
the
latter
for
that
he
was
held
of
all
a
very
sorry
fellow
straightway
put
him
to
the
question
and
he
confessed
to
having
entered
the
usurers
house
to
steal
whereupon
the
governor
thought
to
let
string
him
up
by
the
neck
without
delay
the
news
was
all
over
salerno
by
the
morning
that
ruggieri
had
been
taken
in
the
act
of
robbing
the
house
which
the
lady
and
her
maid
hearing
they
were
filled
with
such
strange
and
exceeding
wonderment
that
they
were
like
to
persuade
themselves
that
they
had
not
done
but
had
only
dreamed
of
doing
that
which
they
had
done
overnight
whilst
the
lady
to
boot
was
so
concerned
at
the
news
of
the
danger
wherein
ruggieri
was
that
she
was
like
to
go
mad
soon
after
half
tierce
the
physician
having
returned
from
malfi
and
wishing
to
medicine
his
patient
called
for
his
prepared
water
and
finding
the
flagon
empty
made
a
great
outcry
saying
that
nothing
could
abide
as
it
was
in
his
house
the
lady
who
was
troubled
with
another
great
chagrin
answered
angrily
saying
wouldst
thou
say
doctor
of
grave
matter
whenas
thou
makest
such
an
outcry
anent
a
flagonlet
of
water
overset
is
there
no
more
water
to
be
found
in
the
world
rejoined
the
physician
thinkest
this
was
common
water
it
was
not
so
nay
it
was
a
water
prepared
to
cause
sleep
and
told
her
for
what
occasion
he
had
made
it
when
she
heard
this
she
understood
forthright
that
ruggieri
had
drunken
the
opiate
and
had
therefore
appeared
to
them
dead
and
said
to
her
husband
we
knew
it
not
wherefore
do
you
make
yourself
some
more
and
the
physician
accordingly
seeing
he
might
not
do
otherwise
let
make
thereof
anew
footnote
about
seven
a
little
after
the
maid
who
had
gone
by
her
mistress
commandment
to
learn
what
should
be
reported
of
ruggieri
returned
and
said
to
her
every
one
missaith
of
ruggieri
nor
for
aught
i
could
hear
is
there
friend
or
kinsman
who
hath
risen
up
or
thinketh
to
rise
up
to
assist
him
and
it
is
held
certain
that
the
prefect
of
police
will
have
him
hanged
moreover
i
have
a
strange
thing
to
tell
you
to
wit
meseemeth
i
have
discovered
how
he
came
into
the
house
and
hear
how
you
know
the
carpenter
overagainst
whose
shop
was
the
chest
wherein
we
laid
him
he
was
but
now
at
the
hottest
words
in
the
world
with
one
to
whom
it
seemeth
the
chest
belonged
for
the
latter
demanded
of
him
the
price
of
his
chest
and
the
carpenter
replied
that
he
had
not
sold
it
but
that
it
had
that
night
been
stolen
from
him
whereto
not
so
quoth
the
other
nay
thou
soldest
it
to
the
two
young
men
the
yonder
as
they
told
me
yesternight
when
i
saw
it
in
their
house
what
time
ruggieri
was
taken
they
lie
answered
the
carpenter
i
never
sold
it
to
them
but
they
stole
it
from
me
yesternight
let
us
go
to
them
so
they
went
off
with
one
accord
to
the
house
and
i
came
back
hither
on
this
wise
as
you
may
see
i
conclude
that
ruggieri
was
transported
whereas
he
was
found
but
how
he
came
to
life
again
i
can
not
divine
the
lady
now
understood
very
well
how
the
case
stood
and
telling
the
maid
what
she
had
heard
from
the
physician
besought
her
help
to
save
ruggieri
for
that
she
might
an
she
would
at
once
save
him
and
preserve
her
honour
quoth
she
teach
me
how
and
i
will
gladly
do
anything
whereupon
the
lady
whose
wits
were
sharpened
by
the
urgency
of
the
case
having
promptly
bethought
herself
of
that
which
was
to
do
particularly
acquainted
the
maid
therewith
who
first
betook
herself
to
the
physician
and
weeping
began
to
say
to
him
it
behoveth
me
ask
you
pardon
of
a
great
fault
which
i
have
committed
against
you
what
asked
the
doctor
and
she
never
giving
over
weeping
answered
you
know
what
manner
young
man
is
ruggieri
da
jeroli
he
took
a
liking
to
me
awhile
agone
and
partly
for
fear
and
partly
for
love
needs
must
i
become
his
mistress
yesternight
knowing
that
you
were
abroad
he
cajoled
me
on
such
wise
that
i
brought
him
into
your
house
to
lie
with
me
in
my
chamber
and
he
being
athirst
and
i
having
no
whither
more
quickly
to
resort
for
water
or
wine
unwilling
as
i
was
that
your
lady
who
was
in
the
saloon
should
see
me
i
remembered
me
to
have
seen
a
flagon
of
water
in
your
chamber
accordingly
i
ran
for
it
and
giving
him
the
water
to
drink
replaced
the
flagon
whence
i
had
taken
it
whereof
i
find
you
have
made
a
great
outcry
in
the
house
and
certes
i
confess
i
did
ill
but
who
is
there
doth
not
ill
bytimes
indeed
i
am
exceeding
grieved
to
have
done
it
not
so
much
for
the
thing
itself
as
for
that
which
hath
ensued
of
it
and
by
reason
whereof
ruggieri
is
like
to
lose
his
life
wherefore
i
pray
you
as
most
i
may
pardon
me
and
give
me
leave
to
go
succour
ruggieri
inasmuch
as
i
can
the
physician
hearing
this
for
all
he
was
angry
answered
jestingly
hast
given
thyself
thine
own
penance
therefor
seeing
that
whereas
thou
thoughtest
yesternight
to
have
a
lusty
young
fellow
who
would
shake
thy
skincoats
well
for
thee
thou
hadst
a
sluggard
wherefore
go
and
endeavour
for
the
deliverance
of
thy
lover
but
henceforth
look
thou
bring
him
not
into
the
house
again
or
i
will
pay
thee
for
this
time
and
that
together
the
maid
thinking
she
had
fared
well
for
the
first
venue
betook
herself
as
quickliest
she
might
to
the
prison
where
ruggieri
lay
and
coaxed
the
gaoler
to
let
her
speak
with
the
prisoner
whom
after
she
had
instructed
what
answers
he
should
make
to
the
prefect
of
police
an
he
would
fain
escape
she
contrived
to
gain
admission
to
the
magistrate
himself
the
latter
for
that
she
was
young
and
buxom
would
fain
ere
he
would
hearken
to
her
cast
his
grapnel
aboard
the
good
wench
whereof
she
to
be
the
better
heard
was
no
whit
chary
then
having
quitted
herself
of
the
grinding
due
said
she
have
here
ruggieri
da
jeroli
taken
for
a
thief
but
the
truth
is
not
so
then
beginning
from
the
beginning
she
told
him
the
whole
story
how
she
being
his
mistress
had
brought
him
into
the
physician
house
and
had
given
him
the
drugged
water
to
drink
unknowing
what
it
was
and
how
she
had
put
him
for
dead
into
the
chest
after
which
she
told
him
the
talk
she
had
heard
between
the
master
carpenter
and
the
owner
of
the
chest
showing
him
thereby
how
ruggieri
had
come
into
the
house
footnote
or
having
risen
from
the
grinding
dal
the
magistrate
seeing
it
an
easy
thing
to
come
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
first
questioned
the
physician
if
it
were
true
of
the
water
and
found
that
it
was
as
she
had
said
whereupon
he
let
summon
the
carpenter
and
him
to
whom
the
chest
belonged
and
the
two
and
after
much
parley
found
that
the
latter
had
stolen
the
chest
overnight
and
put
it
in
their
house
ultimately
he
sent
for
ruggieri
and
questioned
him
where
he
had
lain
that
night
whereto
he
replied
that
where
he
had
lain
he
knew
not
he
remembered
indeed
having
gone
to
pass
the
night
with
master
mazzeo
maid
in
whose
chamber
he
had
drunken
water
for
a
sore
thirst
he
had
but
what
became
of
him
after
he
knew
not
save
that
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
in
the
house
in
a
chest
the
prefect
hearing
these
things
and
taking
great
pleasure
therein
caused
the
maid
and
ruggieri
and
the
carpenter
and
the
repeat
their
story
again
and
again
and
in
the
end
seeing
ruggieri
to
be
innocent
he
released
him
and
amerced
the
in
half
a
score
ounces
for
that
they
had
stolen
the
chest
how
welcome
this
was
to
ruggieri
none
need
ask
and
it
was
beyond
measure
pleasing
to
his
mistress
who
together
with
her
lover
and
the
precious
maid
who
had
proposed
to
give
him
the
slashes
with
the
knife
many
a
time
after
laughed
and
made
merry
of
the
matter
still
continuing
their
loves
and
their
disport
from
good
to
better
the
which
i
would
well
might
so
betide
myself
save
always
the
being
put
in
the
chest
if
the
former
stories
had
saddened
the
hearts
of
the
lovesome
ladies
this
last
one
of
dioneo
made
them
laugh
heartily
especially
when
he
spoke
of
the
prefect
casting
his
grapnel
aboard
the
maid
that
they
were
able
thus
to
recover
themselves
of
the
melancholy
caused
by
the
others
but
the
king
seeing
that
the
sun
began
to
grow
yellow
and
that
the
term
of
his
seignory
was
come
with
very
courteous
speech
excused
himself
to
the
fair
ladies
for
that
which
he
had
done
to
wit
that
he
had
caused
discourse
of
so
sorrowful
a
matter
as
that
of
lovers
infelicity
which
done
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
taking
from
his
head
the
laurel
wreath
whilst
the
ladies
waited
to
see
on
whom
he
should
bestow

set
it
daintily
on

i
make
over

thee

commingled
with

she
after

taking
counsel
with
him
of
things
needful
arising
from

blithely
dismissed
all
the
company

accordingly
they
all
proceeded
according
to
their
various
appetites
to
take
their
several
pleasures
some
wandering
about
the
garden

beauties
were
not
such
as

themselves
towards

hour

there
supped
with

pleasance

addressed
themselves

said
filostrato
i
purpose
not

usance
of
those
who
have
foregone
me
in

sovranty

like
as
they
have
done
so
i
intend
that
a
song
be
sung
at
my
commandment

as
i
am
assured
that
thy

are
even
such

are
thy

so
no

would
well

the

there
was
then
in
the
island
of
cyprus
as
we
have
read
aforetime
in
the
ancient
histories
of
the
cypriots
a
very
noble
gentleman
by
name
aristippus
who
was
rich
beyond
any
other
of
the
country
in
all
temporal
things

himself

not

him
woeful
in

thing

wit
that
amongst
his
other
children
he
had
a
son
who
overpassed
all
the
other
youths
of
his
age
in
stature
and
goodliness
of
body
but
was
a
hopeless
dullard
and
well
nigh
an
idiot
his
true
name
was
galesus
but
for
that
neither
by
toil
of
teacher
nor
blandishment
nor
beating
of
his
father

study

of
whatsoever
other
had
it
been
found
possible
to
put
into
his
head
any
inkling

letters

good
breeding
and
that
he
had
a
rough
voice

an
uncouth
and

beast

a
man
he
was
of
well
nigh
all
by
way
of
mockery
called
cimon
which
in
their
tongue
signified
as
much
as
brute
beast
in
ours
his
father
brooked
his
wastrel
life
with
the
most
grievous
concern
and
having
presently
given
over
all
hope
of
him
he
bade
him
begone
to
his
country
house
and
there
abide
with
his
husbandmen
so
he
might
not
still
have
before
him
the
cause
of
his
chagrin
the
which
was
very
agreeable
to
cimon
for
that
the
manners
and
usages
of
clowns
and
churls
were
much
more
to
his
liking
than
those
of
the
townsfolk

or

cimon
then
betaking
himself
to
the
country
and
there
employing
himself
in
the
things
that
pertained
thereto
it
chanced
one
day
awhile
after
noon
as
he
passed
from
one
farm
to
another
with
his
staff
on
his
shoulder
that
he
entered
a
very
fair
coppice
which
was
in
those
parts
and
which
was
then
all
in
leaf
for
that
it
was
the
month
of
may
passing
therethrough
he
happened
even
as
his
fortune
guided
him
thither
upon
a
little
mead
compassed
about
with
very
high
trees
in
one
corner
whereof
was
a
very
clear
and
cool
spring
beside
which
he
saw
a
very
fair
damsel
asleep
upon
the
green
grass
with
so
thin
a
garment
upon
her
body
that
it
hid
well
nigh
nothing
of
her
snowy
flesh
she
was
covered
only
from
the
waist
down
with
a
very
white
and
light
coverlet
and
at
her
feet
slept
on
like
wise
two
women
and
a
man
her
servants
when
cimon
espied
the
young
lady
he
halted
and
leaning
upon
his
staff
fell
without
saying
a
word
to
gazing
most
intently
upon
her
with
the
utmost
admiration
no
otherwise
than
as
he
had
never
yet
seen
a
woman
form
whilst
in
his
rude
breast
wherein
for
a
thousand
lessonings
no
least
impression
of
civil
pleasance
had
availed
to
penetrate
he
felt
a
thought
awaken
which
intimated
to
his
gross
and
material
spirit
that
this
maiden
was
the
fairest
thing
that
had
been
ever
seen
of
any
living
soul
thence
he
proceeded
to
consider
her
various
parts
commending
her
hair
which
he
accounted
of
gold
her
brow
her
nose
her
mouth
her
throat
and
her
arms
and
above
all
her
breast
as
yet
but
little
upraised
and
grown
of
a
sudden
from
a
churl
a
judge
of
beauty
he
ardently
desired
in
himself
to
see
the
eyes
which
weighed
down
with
deep
sleep
she
kept
closed
to
this
end
he
had
it
several
times
in
mind
to
awaken
her
but
for
that
she
seemed
to
him
beyond
measure
fairer
than
the
other
women
aforetime
seen
of
him
he
misdoubted
him
she
must
be
some
goddess
now
he
had
wit
enough
to
account
things
divine
worthy
of
more
reverence
than
those
mundane
wherefore
he
forbore
waiting
for
her
to
awake
of
herself
and
albeit
the
delay
seemed
overlong
to
him
yet
taken
as
he
was
with
an
unwonted
pleasure
he
knew
not
how
to
tear
himself
away
it
befell
then
that
after
a
long
while
the
damsel
whose
name
was
iphigenia
came
to
herself
before
any
of
her
people
and
opening
her
eyes
saw
cimon
who
what
for
his
fashion
and
uncouthness
and
his
father
wealth
and
nobility
was
known
in
a
manner
to
every
one
in
the
country
standing
before
her
leant
on
his
staff
marvelled
exceedingly
and
said
what
goest
thou
seeking
in
this
wood
at
this
hour
he
made
her
no
answer
but
seeing
her
eyes
open
began
to
look
steadfastly
upon
them
himseeming
there
proceeded
thence
a
sweetness
which
fulfilled
him
with
a
pleasure
such
as
he
had
never
before
felt
the
young
lady
seeing
this
began
to
misdoubt
her
lest
his
so
fixed
looking
upon
her
should
move
his
rusticity
to
somewhat
that
might
turn
to
her
shame
wherefore
calling
her
women
she
rose
up
saying
abide
with
god
to
which
he
replied
will
begone
with
thee
and
albeit
the
young
lady
who
was
still
in
fear
of
him
would
have
declined
his
company
she
could
not
win
to
rid
herself
of
him
till
he
had
accompanied
her
to
her
own
house
thence
he
repaired
to
his
father
house
in
the
city
and
declared
to
him
that
he
would
on
no
wise
consent
to
return
to
the
country
the
which
was
irksome
enough
to
aristippus
and
his
kinsfolk
nevertheless
they
let
him
be
awaiting
to
see
what
might
be
the
cause
of
his
change

mind

arrow
having
then
through
iphigenia
beauty
penetrated
into
cimon
heart
whereinto
no
teaching
had
ever
availed
to
win
an
entrance
in
a
very
brief
time
proceeding
from
one
idea
to
another
he
made
his
father
marvel
and
all
his
kinsfolk
and
every
other
that
knew
him
in
the
first
place
he
besought
his
father
that
he
would
cause
him
go
bedecked
with
clothes
and
every
other
thing
even
as
his
brothers
the
which
aristippus
right
gladly
did
then
consorting
with
young
men
of
condition
and
learning
the
fashions
and
carriage
that
behoved
unto
gentlemen
and
especially
unto
lovers
he
first
to
the
utmost
wonderment
of
every
one
in
a
very
brief
space
of
time
not
only
learned
the
first
elements
of
letters
but
became
very
eminent
among
the
students
of
philosophy
and
after
the
love
which
he
bore
iphigenia
being
the
cause
of
all
this
he
not
only
reduced
his
rude
and
rustical
manner
of
speech
to
seemliness
and
civility
but
became
a
past
master
of
song
and
sound
and
exceeding
expert
and
doughty
in
riding
and
martial
exercises
both
by
land
and
by
sea
in
short
not
to
go
recounting
every
particular
of
his
merits
the
fourth
year
was
not
accomplished
from
the
day
of
his
first
falling
in
love
ere
he
was
grown
the
sprightliest
and
most
accomplished
gentleman
of
all
the
young
men
in
the
island
of
cyprus
ay
and
the
best
endowed
with
every
particular
excellence
what
then
charming
ladies
shall
we
say
of
cimon
certes
none
other
thing
than
that
the
lofty
virtues
implanted
by
heaven
in
his
generous
soul
had
been
bounden
with
exceeding
strong
bonds
of
jealous
fortune
and
shut
in
some
straitest
corner
of
his
heart
all
which
bonds
love
as
a
mightier
than
fortune
broke
and
burst
in
sunder
and
in
its
quality
of
awakener
and
quickener
of
drowsed
and
sluggish
wits
urged
forth
into
broad
daylight
the
virtues
aforesaid
which
had
till
then
been
overdarkened
with
a
barbarous
obscurity
thus
manifestly
discovering
from
how
mean
a
room
it
can
avail
to
uplift
those
souls
that
are
subject
unto
it
and
to
what
an
eminence
it
can
conduct
them
with
its
beams
footnote
of
music
vocal
and
instrumental
although
cimon
loving
iphigenia
as
he
did
might
exceed
in
certain
things
as
young
men
in
love
very
often
do
nevertheless
aristippus
considering
that
love
had
turned
him
from
a
dunce
into
a
man
not
only
patiently
bore
with
the
extravagances
into
which
it
might
whiles
lead
him
but
encouraged
him
to
ensue
its
every
pleasure
but
cimon
who
refused
to
be
called
galesus
remembering
that
iphigenia
had
called
him
by
the
former
name
seeking
to
put
an
honourable
term
to
his
desire
once
and
again
caused
essay
cipseus
iphigenia
father
so
he
should
give
him
his
daughter
to
wife
but
cipseus
still
answered
that
he
had
promised
her
to
pasimondas
a
young
nobleman
of
rhodes
to
whom
he
had
no
mind
to
fail
of
his
word
the
time
coming
the
covenanted
nuptials
of
iphigenia
and
the
bridegroom
having
sent
for
her
cimon
said
to
himself
o
iphigenia
is
the
time
to
prove
how
much
thou
are
beloved
of
me
by
thee
am
i
become
a
man
and
so
i
may
but
have
thee
i
doubt
not
to
become
more
glorious
than
any
god
and
for
certain
i
will
or
have
thee
or
die
accordingly
having
secretly
recruited
certain
young
noblemen
who
were
his
friends
and
let
privily
equip
a
ship
with
everything
apt
for
naval
battle
he
put
out
to
sea
and
awaited
the
vessel
wherein
iphigenia
was
to
be
transported
to
her
husband
in
rhodes
the
bride
after
much
honour
done
of
her
father
to
the
bridegroom
friends
took
ship
with
the
latter
who
turned
their
prow
towards
rhodes
and
departed
on
the
following
day
cimon
who
slept
not
came
out
upon
them
with
his
ship
and
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
from
the
prow
to
those
who
were
on
board
iphigenia
vessel
saying
strike
your
sails
or
look
to
be
beaten
and
sunken
in
the
sea
cimon
adversaries
had
gotten
up
their
arms
on
deck
and
made
ready
to
defend
themselves
whereupon
he
after
speaking
the
words
aforesaid
took
a
and
casting
it
upon
the
poop
of
the
rhodians
who
were
making
off
at
the
top
of
their
speed
made
it
fast
by
main
force
to
the
prow
of
his
own
ship
then
bold
as
a
lion
he
leapt
on
board
their
ship
without
waiting
for
any
to
follow
him
as
if
he
held
them
all
for
nought
and
love
spurring
him
he
fell
upon
his
enemies
with
marvellous
might
cutlass
in
hand
striking
now
this
one
and
now
that
and
hewing
them
down
like
sheep
the
rhodians
seeing
this
cast
down
their
arms
and
all
as
with
one
voice
confessed
themselves
prisoners
whereupon
quoth
cimon
to
them
men
it
was
neither
lust
of
rapine
nor
hate
that
i
had
against
you
made
me
depart
cyprus
to
assail
you
arms
in
hand
in
mid
sea
that
which
moved
me
thereunto
was
the
desire
of
a
thing
which
to
have
gotten
is
a
very
grave
matter
to
me
and
to
you
a
very
light
one
to
yield
me
in
peace
it
is
to
wit
iphigenia
whom
i
loved
over
all
else
and
whom
availing
not
to
have
of
her
father
on
friendly
and
peaceful
wise
love
hath
constrained
me
to
win
from
you
as
an
enemy
and
by
force
of
arms
wherefor
i
mean
to
be
to
her
that
which
your
friend
pasimondas
should
have
been
give
her
to
me
then
and
begone
and
god
grace
go
with
you
the
rhodians
more
by
force
constrained
than
of
freewill
surrendered
iphigenia
weeping
to
cimon
who
seeing
her
in
tears
said
to
her
lady
be
not
disconsolate
i
am
thy
cimon
who
by
long
love
have
far
better
deserved
to
have
thee
than
pasimondas
by
plighted
faith
thereupon
he
caused
carry
her
aboard
his
own
ship
and
returning
to
his
companions
let
the
rhodians
go
without
touching
aught
else
of
theirs
then
glad
beyond
any
man
alive
to
have
gotten
so
dear
a
prey
after
devoting
some
time
to
comforting
the
weeping
lady
he
took
counsel
with
his
comrades
not
to
return
to
cyprus
at
that
present
wherefore
of
one
accord
they
turned
the
ship
head
towards
crete
where
well
nigh
every
one
and
especially
cimon
had
kinsfolk
old
and
new
and
friends
in
plenty
and
where
they
doubted
not
to
be
in
safety
with
iphigenia
but
fortune
the
unstable
which
had
cheerfully
enough
vouchsafed
unto
cimon
the
acquisition
of
the
lady
suddenly
changed
the
inexpressible
joyance
of
the
enamoured
youth
into
sad
and
bitter
mourning
for
it
was
not
four
full
told
hours
since
he
had
left
the
rhodians
when
the
night
which
cimon
looked
to
be
more
delightsome
than
any
he
had
ever
known
came
on
and
with
it
a
very
troublous
and
tempestuous
shift
of
weather
which
filled
all
the
sky
with
clouds
and
the
sea
with
ravening
winds
by
reason
whereof
none
could
see
what
to
do
or
whither
to
steer
nor
could
any
even
keep
the
deck
to
do
any
office
how
sore
concerned
was
cimon
for
this
it
needeth
not
to
ask
himseemed
the
gods
had
vouchsafed
him
his
desire
but
to
make
death
the
more
grievous
to
him
whereof
without
that
he
had
before
recked
little
his
comrades
lamented
on
like
wise
but
iphigenia
bewailed
herself
over
all
weeping
sore
and
fearing
every
stroke
of
the
waves
and
in
her
chagrin
she
bitterly
cursed
cimon
love
and
blamed
his
presumption
avouching
that
the
tempest
had
arisen
for
none
other
thing
but
that
the
gods
chose
not
that
he
who
would
fain
against
their
will
have
her
to
wife
should
avail
to
enjoy
his
presumptuous
desire
but
seeing
her
first
die
should
after
himself
perish
miserably
amidst
such
lamentations
and
others
yet
more
grievous
the
wind
waxing
hourly
fiercer
and
the
seamen
knowing
not
what
to
do
they
came
without
witting
whither
they
went
or
availing
to
change
their
course
near
to
the
island
of
rhodes
and
unknowing
that
it
was
rhodes
they
used
their
every
endeavour
to
get
to
land
thereon
an
it
were
possible
for
the
saving
of
their
lives
in
this
fortune
was
favourable
to
them
and
brought
them
into
a
little
bight
of
the
sea
where
the
rhodians
whom
cimon
had
let
go
had
a
little
before
arrived
with
their
ship
nor
did
they
perceive
that
they
had
struck
the
island
of
rhodes
till
the
dawn
broke
and
made
the
sky
somewhat
clearer
when
they
found
themselves
maybe
a
bowshot
distant
from
the
ship
left
of
them
the
day
before
at
this
cimon
was
beyond
measure
chagrined
and
fearing
lest
that
should
betide
them
which
did
in
very
deed
ensue
bade
use
every
endeavour
to
issue
thence
and
let
fortune
after
carry
them
whither
it
should
please
her
for
that
they
could
be
nowhere
in
worse
case
than
there
accordingly
they
made
the
utmost
efforts
to
put
to
sea
but
in
vain
for
the
wind
blew
so
mightily
against
them
that
not
only
could
they
not
avail
to
issue
from
the
little
harbour
but
whether
they
would
or
no
it
drove
them
ashore
no
sooner
were
they
come
thither
than
they
were
recognized
by
the
rhodian
sailors
who
had
landed
from
their
ship
and
one
of
them
ran
nimbly
to
a
village
hard
by
whither
the
young
rhodian
gentlemen
had
betaken

cimon
and
iphigenia
were
come
thither
aboard

ship

like
themselves

stress
of
weather
they
hearing
this
were
greatly
rejoiced
and
repairing
in
all
haste
to
the
with
a
number
of
the
villagers
took
cimon
together
with
iphigenia
and
all
his
company
who
had
now
landed
and
taken
counsel
together
to
flee
into
some
neighbouring
wood
and
carried
them
to
the
village
the
news
coming
to
pasimondas
he
made
his
complaint
to
the
senate
of
the
island
and
according
as
he
had
ordered
it
with
them
lysimachus
in
whom
the
chief
magistracy
of
the
rhodians
was
for
that
year
vested
coming
thither
from
the
city
with
a
great
company
of
haled
cimon
and
all
his
men
to
prison
on
such
wise
did
the
wretched
and
lovelorn
cimon
lose
his
iphigenia
scantwhile
before
won
of
him
without
having
taken
of
her
more
than
a
kiss
or
two
whilst
she
herself
was
received
by
many
noble
ladies
of
rhodes
and
comforted
as
well
for
the
chagrin
had
of
her
seizure
as
for
the
fatigue
suffered
by
reason
of
the
troubled
sea
and
with
them
she
abode
against
the
day
appointed
for
her
nuptials

companions
their
lives
were
granted

in
consideration
of
the
liberty
given
by
them
to
the
young
rhodians
the
day

pasimondas
used
his

endeavour
to
procure
them
to
be
put
to
death
and
they
were
condemned
to
perpetual
prison
wherein
as
may
well
be
believed
they
abode
woebegone
and
without
hope
of
any
relief
however
whilst
pasimondas
as
most
he
might
hastened
the
preparations
for
his
coming
nuptials
fortune
as
if
repenting
her
of
the
sudden
injury
done
to
cimon
brought
about
a
new
circumstance
for
his
deliverance
the
which
was
on
this
wise
pasimondas
had
a
brother
called
ormisdas
less
in
years
but
not
in
merit
than
himself
who
had
been
long
in
treaty
for
the
hand
of
a
fair
and
noble
damsel
of
the
city
by
name
cassandra
whom
lysimachus
ardently
loved
and
the
match
had
sundry
times
been
broken
off
by
divers
untoward
accidents
now
pasimondas
being
about
to
celebrate
his
own
nuptials
with
the
utmost
splendour
bethought
himself
that
it
were
excellently
well
done
if
he
could
procure
ormisdas
likewise
to
take
wife
on
the
same
occasion
not
to
resort
afresh
to
expense
and
festival
making
accordingly
he
took
up
again
the
parleys
with
cassandra
parents
and
brought
them
to
a
successful
issue
wherefore
he
and
his
brother
agreed
in
concert
with
them
that
ormisdas
should
take
cassandra
to
wife
on
the
same
day
whenas
himself
took
iphigenia
lysimachus
hearing
this
it
was
beyond
measure
displeasing
to
him
for
that
he
saw
himself
bereaved
of
the
hope
which
he
cherished
that
an
ormisdas
took
her
not
he
should
certainly
have
her
however
like
a
wise
man
he
kept
his
chagrin
hidden
and
fell
to
considering
on
what
wise
he
might
avail
to
hinder
this
having
effect
but
could
see
no
way
possible
save
the
carrying
her
off
this
seemed
easy
to
him
to
compass
for
the
office
which
he
held
but
he
accounted
the
deed
far
more
dishonourable
than
if
he
had
not
held
the
office
in
question
ultimately
however
after
long
deliberation
honour
gave
place
to
love
and
he
determined
come
what
might
of
it
to
carry
off
cassandra
then
bethinking
himself
of
the
company
he
must
have
and
the
course
he
must
hold
to
do
this
he
remembered
him
of
cimon
whom
he
had
in
prison
with
his
comrades
and
concluded
that
he
might
have
no
better
or
trustier
companion
than
cimon
in
this
affair
accordingly
that
same
night
he
had
him
privily
into
his
chamber
and
proceeded
to
bespeak
him
on
this
wise
like
as
the
gods
are
very
excellent
and
bountiful
givers
of
things
to
men
even
so
are
they
most
sagacious
provers
of
their
virtues
and
those
whom
they
find
resolute
and
constant
under
all
circumstances
they
hold
deserving
as
the
most
worthy
of
the
highest
recompenses
they
have
been
minded
to
have
more
certain
proof
of
thy
worth
than
could
be
shown
by
thee
within
the
limits
of
thy
father
house
whom
i
know
to
be
abundantly
endowed
with
riches
wherefore
first
with
the
poignant
instigations
of
love
they
brought
thee
from
a
senseless
animal
to
be
a
man
and
after
with
foul
fortune
and
at
this
present
with
prison
dour
they
would
fain
try
if
thy
spirit

not
from
that
which
it
was
whenas
thou
wast
scantwhile
glad
of
the
gotten
prize

that

it

they
never

vouchsafed
thee
aught
so
gladsome

they
are
presently

thee

armed
under

into

having

kindled
them
to

secretly
despatched

to

it
does
not

that

the

her
back
to
lipari
and
starting
suddenly
to
her
feet
looked
about
her
but
knew
not
the
country
and
seeing
herself
on
land
asked
the
good
woman
where
she
was
to
which
she
answered
mine
thou
art
near
unto
susa
in
barbary
the
girl
hearing
this
was
woeful
for
that
god
had
not
chosen
to
vouchsafe
her
the
death
she
sought
and
being
in
fear
of
shame
and
knowing
not
what
to
do
she
seated
herself
at
the
foot
of
her
bark
and
fell
footnote
knew
not
whether
she
was
ashore
or
afloat
so
absorbed
was
she
in
her
despair
the
good
woman
seeing
this
took
pity
upon
her
and
brought
her
by
dint
of
entreaty
into
a
little
hut
of
hers
and
there
so
humoured
her
that
she
told
her
how
she
came
thither
whereupon
seeing
that
she
was
fasting
she
set
before
her
her
own
dry
bread
and
somewhat
of
fish
and
water
and
so
besought
her
that
she
ate
a
little
costanza
after
asked
her
who
she
was
that
she
spoke
latin
thus
to
which
she
answered
that
she
was
from
trapani
and
was
called
carapresa
and
served
certain
christian
fishermen
there
the
girl
hearing
the
name
of
carapresa
albeit
she
was
exceeding
woebegone
and
knew
not
what
reason
moved
her
thereunto
took
it
unto
herself
for
a
good
augury
to
have
heard
this
name
and
began
to
hope
without
knowing
what
and
somewhat
to
abate
of
her
wish
to
die
then
without
discovering
who
or
whence
she
was
she
earnestly
besought
the
good
woman
to
have
pity
for
the
love
of
god
on
her
youth
and
give
her
some
counsel
how
she
might
escape
any
affront
being
offered

like
a
good
woman
as
she
was
hearing
this
left
her
in
her
hut
whilst
she
hastily
gathered
up
her
nets
then
returning
to
her
she
wrapped
her
from
head
to
foot
in
her
own
mantle
and
carried
her
to
susa
where
she
said
to
her
i
will
bring
thee
into
the
house
of
a
very
good
saracen
lady
whom
i
serve
oftentimes
in
her
occasions
and
who
is
old
and
pitiful
i
will
commend
thee
to
her
as
most
i
may
and
i
am
very
certain
that
she
will
gladly
receive
thee
and
use
thee
as
a
daughter
and
do
thou
abiding
with
her
study
thine
utmost
in
serving
her
to
gain
her
favour
against
god
send
thee
better
fortune
and
as
she
said
so
she
did
the
lady
who
was
well
stricken
in
years
hearing
the
woman
story
looked
the
girl
in
the
face
and
fell
then
taking
her
by
the
hand
she
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
carried
her
into
her
house
where
she
and
sundry
other
women
abode
without
any
man
and
wrought
all
with
their
hands
at
various
crafts
doing
divers
works
of
silk
and
and
leather
costanza
soon
learned
to
do
some
of
these
and
falling
to
working
with
the
rest
became
in
such
favour
with
the
lady
and
the
others
that
it
was
a
marvellous
thing
nor
was
it
long
before
with
their
teaching
she
learnt
their
language
what
while
she
abode
thus
at
susa
being
now
mourned
at
home
for
lost
and
dead
it
befell
that
one
mariabdela
being
king
of
tunis
a
certain
youth
of
great
family
and
much
puissance
in
granada
avouching
that
that
kingdom
belonged
to
himself
levied
a
great
multitude
of
folk
and
came
upon
king
mariabdela
to
oust
him
from
the
kingship
this
came
to
the
ears
of
martuccio
gomito
in
prison
and
he
knowing
the
barbary
language
excellent
well
and
hearing
that
the
king
was
making
great
efforts
for
his
defence
said
to
one
of
those
who
had
him
and
his
fellows
in
keeping
i
might
have
speech
of
the
king
my
heart
assureth
me
that
i
could
give
him
a
counsel
by
which
he
should
gain
this
his
war
the
keeper
reported
these
words
to
his
chief
and
he
carried
them
incontinent
to
the
king
who
bade
fetch
martuccio
and
asked
him
what
might
be
his
counsel
whereto
he
made
answer
on
this
wise
lord
if
what
time
i
have
otherwhiles
frequented
these
your
dominions
i
have
noted
aright
the
order
you
keep
in
your
battles
meseemeth
you
wage
them
more
with
archers
than
with
aught
else
wherefore
if
a
means
could
be
found
whereby
your
adversary
bowmen
should
lack
of
arrows
whilst
your
own
had
abundance
thereof
methinketh
your
battle
would
be
won
doubt
answered
the
king
this
might
be
compassed
i
should
deem
myself
assured
of
victory
whereupon
lord
quoth
martuccio
you
will
this
may
very
well
be
done
and
you
shall
hear
how
you
must
let
make
strings
for
your
archers
bows
much
thinner
than
those
which
are
everywhere
commonly
used
and
after
let
make
arrows
the
notches
whereof
shall
not
serve
but
for
these
thin
strings
this
must
be
so
secretly
done
that
your
adversary
should
know
nought
thereof
else
would
he
find
a
remedy
therefor
and
the
reason
for
which
i
counsel
you
thus
is
this
after
your
enemy
archers
and
your
own
shall
have
shot
all
their
arrows
you
know
that
the
battle
lasting
it
will
behove
your
foes
to
gather
up
the
arrows
shot
by
your
men
and
the
latter
in
like
manner
to
gather
theirs
but
the
enemy
will
not
be
able
to
make
use
of
your
arrows
by
reason
of
the
strait
notches
which
will
not
take
their
thick
strings
whereas
the
contrary
will
betide
your
men
of
the
enemy
arrows
for
that
the
thin
strings
will
excellently
well
take
the
arrows
and
so
your
men
will
have
abundance
of
ammunition
whilst
the
others
will
suffer
default
thereof
footnote
this
name
is
apparently
a
distortion
of
the
arabic
the
king
who
was
a
wise
prince
was
pleased
with
martuccio
counsel
and
punctually
following
it
found
himself
thereby
to
have
won
his
war
wherefore
martuccio
became
in
high
favour
with
him
and
rose
in
consequence
to
great
and
rich
estate
the
report
of
these
things
spread
over
the
land
and
it
came
presently
to
costanza
ears
that
martuccio
gomito
whom
she
had
long
deemed
dead
was
alive
whereupon
the
love
of
him
that
was
now
grown
cool
in
her
heart
broke
out
of
a
sudden
into
fresh
flame
and
waxed
greater
than
ever
whilst
dead
hope
revived
in
her
therewithal
she
altogether
discovered
her
every
adventure
to
the
good
lady
with
whom
she
dwelt
and
told
her
that
she
would
fain
go
to
tunis
so
she
might
satisfy
her
eyes
of
that
whereof
her
ears
had
made
them
desireful
through
the
reports
received
the
old
lady
greatly
commended
her
purpose
and
taking
ship
with
her
carried
her
as
if
she
had
been
her
mother
to
tunis
where
they
were
honourably
entertained
in
the
house
of
a
kinswoman
of
hers
there
she
despatched
carapresa
who
had
come
with
them
to
see
what
she
could
learn
of
martuccio
and
she
finding
him
alive
and
in
great
estate
and
reporting
this
to
the
old
gentlewoman
it
pleased
the
latter
to
will
to
be
she
who
should
signify
unto
martuccio
that
his
costanza
was
come
thither
to
him
wherefore
betaking
herself
one
day
whereas
he
was
she
said
to
him
there
is
come
to
my
house
a
servant
of
thine
from
lipari
who
would
fain
speak
with
thee
privily
there
wherefore
not
to
trust
to
others
i
have
myself
at
his
desire
come
to
give
thee
notice
thereof
he
thanked
her
and
followed
her
to
her
house
where
when
costanza
saw
him
she
was
like
to
die
of
gladness
and
unable
to
contain
herself
ran
straightway
with
open
arms
to
throw
herself
on
his
neck
then
embracing
him
without
availing
to
say
aught
she
fell
tenderly
both
for
compassion
of
their
past
ill
fortunes
and
for
present
gladness
martuccio
seeing
his
mistress
abode
awhile
dumb
for
amazement
then
said
sighing
my
costanza
art
thou
then
yet
alive
it
is
long
since
i
heard
that
thou
wast
lost
nor
in
our
country
was
aught
known
of
thee
so
saying
he
embraced
her
weeping
and
kissed
her
tenderly
costanza
then
related
to
him
all
that
had
befallen
her
and
the
honourable
treatment
which
she
had
received
from
the
gentlewoman
with
whom
she
dwelt
and
martuccio
after
much
discourse
taking
leave
of
her
repaired
to
the
king
his
master
and
told
him
all
to
wit
his
own
adventures
and
those
of
the
damsel
adding
that
with
his
leave
he
meant
to
take
her
to
wife
according
to
our
law
the
king
marvelled
at
these
things
and
sending
for
the
damsel
and
hearing
from
her
that
it
was
even
as
martuccio
had
avouched
said
to
her
hast
thou
right
well
earned
him
to
husband
then
letting
bring
very
great
and
magnificent
gifts
he
gave
part
thereof
to
her
and
part
to
martuccio
granting
them
leave
to
do
one
with
the
other
that
which
was
most
pleasing
unto
each
of
them
whereupon
martuccio
having
entreated
the
gentlewoman
who
had
harboured
costanza
with
the
utmost
honour
and
thanked
her
for
that
which
she
had
done
to
serve
her
and
bestowed
on
her
such
gifts
as
sorted
with
her
quality
commended
her
to
god
and
took
leave
of
her
he
and
his
mistress
not
without
many
tears
from
the
latter
then
with
the
king
leave
they
embarked
with
carapresa
on
board
a
little
ship
and
returned
with
a
fair
wind
to
lipari
where
so
great
was
the
rejoicing
that
it
might
never
be
told
there
martuccio
took
costanza
to
wife
and
held
great
and
goodly
nuptials
after

as

that

there
was
a
little
while
agone
at
rome
once
the
head
as
it
is
nowadays
the
tail
of
the
world
a
youth
called
pietro
boccamazza
of
a
very
worshipful
family
among
those
of
the
city
who
fell
in
love
with
a
very
fair
and
lovesome
damsel
called
agnolella
the
daughter
of
one
gigliuozzo
saullo
a
plebeian
but
very
dear
to
the
romans
and
loving
her
he
contrived
so
to
do
that
the
girl
began
to
love
him
no
less
than
he
loved
her
whereupon
constrained
by
fervent
love
and
himseeming
he
might
no
longer
brook
the
cruel
pain
that
the
desire
he
had
of
her
gave
him
he
demanded
her
in
marriage
which
no
sooner
did
his
kinsfolk
know
than
they
all
repaired
to
him
and
chid
him
sore
for
that
which
he
would
have
done
and
on
the
other
hand
they
gave
gigliuozzo
to
understand
that
he
should
make
no
account
of
pietro
words
for
that
an
he
did
this
they
would
never
have
him
for
friend
or
kinsman
pietro
seeing
that
way
barred
whereby
alone
he
deemed
he
might
avail
to
win
to
his
desire
was
like
to
die
of
chagrin
and
had
gigliuozzo
consented
he
would
have
taken
his
daughter
to
wife
in
despite
of
all
his
kindred
however
he
determined
an
it
liked
the
girl
to
contrive
to
give
effect
to
their
wishes
and
having
assured
himself
by
means
of
an
intermediary
that
this
was
agreeable
to
her
he
agreed
with
her
that
she
should
flee

it
is
apparently
to
this
circumstance
that
boccaccio
alludes
in
the
text
accordingly
having
taken
order
for
this
pietro
arose
very
early
one
morning
and
taking
horse
with
the
damsel
set
out
for
anagni
where
he
had
certain
friends
in
whom
he
trusted
greatly
they
had
no
leisure
to
make
a
wedding
of
it
for
that
they
feared
to
be
followed
but
rode
on
devising
of
their
love
and
now
and
again
kissing
one
another
it
chanced
that
when
they
came
mayhap
eight
miles
from
rome
the
way
not
being
overwell
known
to
pietro
they
took
a
path
to
the
left
whereas
they
should
have
kept
to
the
right
and
scarce
had
they
ridden
more
than
two
miles
farther
when
they
found
themselves
near
a
little
castle
wherefrom
as
soon
as
they
were
seen
there
issued
suddenly
a
dozen
footmen
the
girl
espying
these
whenas
they
were
already
close
upon
them
cried
out
saying
let
us
begone
for
we
are
attacked
then
turning
her
rouncey
head
as
best
she
knew
towards
a
great
wood
hard
by
she
clapped
her
spurs
fast
to
his
flank
and
held
on
to
the
saddlebow
whereupon
the
nag
feeling
himself
goaded
bore
her
into
the
wood
at
a
gallop
pietro
who
went
gazing
more
at
her
face
than
at
the
road
not
having
become
so
quickly
aware
as
she
of
the
new
comers
was
overtaken
and
seized
by
them
whilst
he
still
looked
without
yet
perceiving
them
to
see
whence
they
should
come
they
made
him
alight
from
his
hackney
and
enquired
who
he
was
which
he
having
told
they
proceeded
to
take
counsel
together
and
said
fellow
is
of
the
friends
of
our
enemies
what
else
should
we
do
but
take
from
him
these
clothes
and
this
nag
and
string
him
up
to
one
of
yonder
oaks
to
spite
the
orsini
they
all
fell
in
with
this
counsel
and
bade
pietro
put
off
his
clothes
which
as
he
was
in
act
to
do
foreboding
him
by
this
of
the
ill
fate
which
awaited
him
it
chanced
that
an
ambush
of
good
footmen
started
suddenly
out
upon
the
others
crying
kill
the
rogues
taken
by
surprise
let
pietro
be
and
turned
to
stand
upon
their
defence
but
seeing
themselves
greatly
outnumbered
by
their
assailants
betook
themselves
to
flight
whilst
the
others
pursued
them
pietro
seeing
this
hurriedly
caught
up
his
gear
and
springing
on
his
hackney
addressed
himself
as
best
he
might
to
flee
by
the
way
he
had
seen
his
mistress
take
but
finding
her
not
and
seeing
neither
road
nor
footpath
in
the
wood
neither
perceiving
any
horse
hoof
marks
he
was
the
woefullest
man
alive
and
as
soon
as
himseemed
he
was
safe
and
out
of
reach
of
those
who
had
taken
him
as
well
as
of
the
others
by
whom
they
had
been
assailed
he
began
to
drive
hither
and
thither
about
the
wood
weeping
and
calling
but
none
answered
him
and
he
dared
not
turn
back
and
knew
not
where
he
might
come
an
he
went
forward
more
by
token
that
he
was
in
fear
of
the
wild
beasts
that
use
to
harbour
in
the
woods
at
once
for
himself
and
for
his
mistress
whom
he
looked
momently
to
see
strangled
of
some
bear
or
some
wolf
on
this
wise
then
did
the
unlucky
pietro
range
all
day
about
the
wood
crying
and
calling

going
backward
when
as
he
thought
to
go
forward
until
what
with
shouting

weeping
and
fear
and
long
fasting
he
was
so
spent
that

could
no

not
what
other
course
to
take
he
dismounted
from
his
hackney
and
tied
the
latter
to
a
great
oak
into
which
he
climbed
so
he
might
not
be
devoured
of
the
wild
beasts
in
the
night
a
little
after
the
moon
rose
and
the
night
being
very
clear
and
bright
he
abode
there
on
wake
sighing
and
weeping
and
cursing
his
ill
luck
for
that
he
durst
not
go
to
sleep
lest
he
should
fall
albeit
had
he
had
more
commodity
thereof
grief
and
the
concern
in
which
he
was
for
his
mistress
would
not
have
suffered
him
to
sleep
meanwhile
the
damsel
fleeing
as
we
have
before
said
and
knowing
not
whither
to
betake
herself
save
whereas
it
seemed
good
to
her
hackney
to
carry
her
fared
on
so
far
into
the
wood
that
she
could
not
see
where
she
had
entered
and
went
wandering
all
day
about
that
desert
place
no
otherwise
than
as
pietro
had
done
now
pausing
to
hearken
and
now
going
on
weeping
the
while
and
calling
and
making
moan
of
her
illhap
at
last
seeing
that
pietro
came
not
and
it
being
now
eventide
she
happened
on
a
little
path
into
which
her
hackney
turned
and
following
it
after
she
had
ridden
some
two
or
more
miles
she
saw
a
little
house
afar
off
thither
she
made
her
way
as
quickliest
she
might
and
found
there
a
good
man
sore
stricken
in
years
and
a
woman
his
wife
alike
old
who
seeing
her
alone
said
to
her
what
dost
thou
alone
at
this
hour
in
these
parts
the
damsel
replied
weeping
that
she
had
lost
her
company
in
the
wood
and
enquired
how
near
she
was
to
anagni
mine
answered
the
good
man
is
not
the
way
to
go
to
anagni
it
is
more
than
a
dozen
miles
hence
quoth
the
girl
how
far
is
it
hence
to
any
habitations
where
i
may
have
a
lodging
for
the
night
to
which
the
good
man
answered
is
none
anywhere
so
near
that
thou
mayst
come
thither
by
daylight
then
said
the
damsel
i
can
go
no
otherwhere
will
it
please
you
harbour
me
here
for
the
love
of
god
lady
replied
the
old
man
art
very
welcome
to
abide
with
us
this
night
algates
we
must
warn
you
that
there
are
many
ill
companies
both
of
friends
and
of
foes
that
come
and
go
about
these
parts
both
by
day
and
by
night
who
many
a
time
do
us
sore
annoy
and
great
mischief
and
if
by
ill
chance
thou
being
here
there
come
any
of
them
and
seeing
thee
fair
and
young
as
thou
art
should
offer
to
do
thee
affront
and
shame
we
could
not
avail
to
succour
thee
therefrom
we
deem
it
well
to
apprise
thee
of
this
so
that
an
it
betide
thou
mayst
not
be
able
to
complain
of
us
the
girl
seeing
that
it
was
late
albeit
the
old
man
words
affrighted
her
said
it
please
god
he
will
keep
both
you
and
me
from
that
annoy
and
even
if
it
befall
me
it
were
a
much
less
evil
to
be
maltreated
of
men
than
to
be
mangled
of
the
wild
beasts
in
the
woods
so
saying
she
alighted
from
the
rouncey
and
entered
the
poor
man
house
where
she
supped
with
him
on
such
poor
fare
as
they
had
and
after
all
clad
as
she
was
cast
herself
together
with
them
on
a
little
bed
of
theirs
she
gave
not
over
sighing
and
bewailing
her
own
mishap
and
that
of
pietro
all
night
knowing
not
if
she
might
hope
other
than
ill
of
him
and
when
it
drew
near
unto
morning
she
heard
a
great
trampling
of
folk
approaching
whereupon
she
arose
and
betaking
herself
to
a
great
courtyard
that
lay
behind
the
little
house
saw
in
a
corner
a
great
heap
of
hay
in
which
she
hid
herself
so
she
might
not
be
so
quickly
found
if
those
folk
should
come
thither
hardly
had
she
made
an
end
of
hiding
herself
when
these
who
were
a
great
company
of
ill
knaves
came
to
the
door
of
the
little
house
and
causing
open
to
them
entered
and
found
agnolella
hackney
yet
all
saddled
and
bridled
whereupon
they
asked
who
was
there
and
the
good
man
not
seeing
the
girl
answered
is
here
save
ourselves
but
this
rouncey
from
whomsoever
it
may
have
escaped
came
hither
yestereve
and
we
brought
it
into
the
house
lest
the
wolves
should
eat
it
said
the
captain
of
the
troop
it
hath
none
other
master
it
is
fair
prize
for
us
thereupon
they
all
dispersed
about
the
little
house
and
some
went
into
the
courtyard
where
laying
down
their
lances
and
targets
it
chanced
that
one
of
them
knowing
not
what
else
to
do
cast
his
lance
into
the
hay
and
came
very
near
to
slay
the
hidden
girl
and
she
to
discover
herself
for
that
the
lance
passed
so
close
to
her
left
breast
that
the
steel
tore
a
part
of
her
dress
wherefore
she
was
like
to
utter
a
great
cry
fearing
to
be
wounded
but
remembering
where
she
was
she
abode
still
all
presently
the
rogues
having
dressed
the
kids
and
other
meat
they
had
with
them
and
eaten
and
drunken
went
off
some
hither
and
some
thither
about
their
affairs
and
carried
with
them
the
girl
hackney
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
the
good
man
asked
his
wife
befell
of
our
young
woman
who
came
thither
yestereve
i
have
seen
nothing
of
her
since
we
arose
the
good
wife
replied
that
she
knew
not
and
went
looking
for
her
whereupon
the
girl
hearing
that
the
rogues
were
gone
came
forth
of
the
hay
to
the
no
small
contentment
of
her
host
who
rejoiced
to
see
that
she
had
not
fallen
into
their
hands
said
to
her
it
now
growing
day
that
the
day
cometh
we
will
an
it
please
thee
accompany
thee
to
a
castle
five
miles
hence
where
thou
wilt
be
in
safety
but
needs
must
thou
go
afoot
for
yonder
ill
folk
that
now
departed
hence
have
carried
off
thy
rouncey
the
girl
concerned
herself
little
about
the
nag
but
besought
them
for
god
sake
to
bring
her
to
the
castle
in
question
whereupon
they
set
out
and
came
thither
about
half
tierce
now
this
castle
belonged
to
one
of
the
orsini
family
by
name
lionello
di
campodifiore
and
there
by
chance
was
his
wife
a
very
pious
and
good
lady
who
seeing
the
girl
knew
her
forthright
and
received
her
with
joy
and
would
fain
know
orderly
how
she
came
thither
agnolella
told
her
all
and
the
lady
who
knew
pietro
on
like
wise
as
being
a
friend
of
her
husband
was
grieved
for
the
ill
chance
that
had
betided
and
hearing
where
he
had
been
taken
doubted
not
but
he
was
dead
wherefore
she
said
to
agnolella
thou
knowest
not
what
is
come
of
pietro
thou
shalt
abide
here
till
such
time
as
i
shall
have
a
commodity
to
send
thee
safe
to
rome
meanwhile
pietro
abode
as
woebegone
as
could
be
in
the
oak
and
towards
the
season
of
the
first
sleep
he
saw
a
good
score
of
wolves
appear
which
came
all
about
his
hackney
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
the
horse
scenting
them
tugged
at
his
bridle
till
he
broke
it
and
would
have
fled
but
being
surrounded
and
unable
to
escape
he
defended
himself
a
great
while
with
his
teeth
and
his
hoofs
at
last
however
he
was
brought
down
and
strangled
and
quickly
disembowelled
by
the
wolves
which
took
all
their
fill
of
his
flesh
and
having
devoured
him
made
off
without
leaving
aught
but
the
bones
whereat
pietro
to
whom
it
seemed
he
had
in
the
rouncey
a
companion
and
a
support
in
his
troubles
was
sore
dismayed
and
misdoubted
he
should
never
avail
to
win
forth
of
the
wood
however
towards
daybreak
being
perished
with
cold
in
the
oak
and
looking
still
all
about
him
he
caught
sight
of
a
great
fire
before
him
mayhap
a
mile
off
wherefore
as
soon
as
it
was
grown
broad
day
he
came
down
from
the
oak
not
without
fear
and
making
for
the
fire
fared
on
till
he
came
to
the
place
where
he
found
shepherds
eating
and
making
merry
about
it
by
whom
he
was
received
for
compassion
after
he
had
eaten
and
warmed
himself
he
acquainted
them
with
his
misadventure
and
telling
them
how
he
came
thither
alone
asked
them
if
there
was
in
those
parts
a
village
or
castle
to
which
he
might
betake
himself
the
shepherds
answered
that
some
three
miles
thence
there
was
a
castle
belonging
to
lionello
di
campodifiore
whose
lady
was
presently
there
whereat
pietro
was
much
rejoiced
and
besought
them
that
one
of
them
should
accompany
him
to
the
castle
which
two
of
them
readily
did
there
he
found
some
who
knew
him
and
was
in
act
to
enquire
for
a
means
of
having
search
made
about
the
forest
for
the
damsel
when
he
was
bidden
to
the
lady
presence
and
incontinent
repaired
to
her
never
was
joy
like
unto
his
when
he
saw
agnolella
with
her
and
he
was
all
consumed
with
desire
to
embrace
her
but
forbore
of
respect
for
the
lady
and
if
he
was
glad
the
girl
joy
was
no
less
great
the
gentle
lady
having
welcomed
him
and
made
much
of
him
and
heard
from
him
what
had
betided
him
chid
him
amain
of
that
which
he
would
have
done
against
the
will
of
his
kinsfolk
but
seeing
that
he
was
resolved
upon
this
and
that
it
was
agreeable
to
the
girl
also
she
said
in
herself
do
i
weary
myself
in
vain
these
two
love
and
know
each
other
and
both
are
friends
of
my
husband
their
desire
is
an
honourable
one
and
meseemeth
it
is
pleasing
to
god
since
the
one
of
them
hath
scaped
the
gibbet
and
the
other
the
and
both
the
wild
beasts
of
the
wood
wherefore
be
it
as
they
will
then
turning
to
the
lovers
she
said
to
them
you
have
it
still
at
heart
to
be
man
and
wife
it
is
my
pleasure
also
be
it
so
and
let
the
nuptials
be
celebrated
here
at
lionello
expense
i
will
engage
after
to
make
peace
between
you
and
your
families
accordingly
they
were
married
then
and
there
to
the
great
contentment
of
pietro
and
the
yet
greater
satisfaction
of
agnolella
and
the
gentle
lady
made
them
honourable
nuptials
in
so
far
as
might
be
in
the
mountains
there
with
the
utmost
delight
they
enjoyed
the
of
their
love
and
a
few
days
after
they
took
horse
with
the
lady
and
returned
under
good
escort
to
rome
where
she
found
pietro
kinsfolk
sore
incensed
at
that
which
he
had
done
but
contrived
to
make
his
peace
with
them
and
he
lived
with
his
agnolella
in
all
peace
and
pleasance
to
a
good
old
age
the

one
of
his

whereupon
he
began
laughing
i
have
been
so
often
rated
by
so
many
of
you
ladies
for
having
imposed
on
you
matter
for
woeful
discourse
and
such
as
tended
to
make
you
weep
that
methinketh
i
am
beholden
an
i
would
in
some
measure
requite
you
that
annoy
to
relate
somewhat
whereby
i
may
make
you
laugh
a
little
and
i
mean
therefore
to
tell
you
in
a
very
short
story
of
a
love
that
after
no
worse
hindrance
than
sundry
sighs
and
a
brief
fright
mingled
with
shame
came
to
a
happy
issue
it
is
then
noble
ladies
no
great
while
ago
since
there
lived
in
romagna
a
gentleman
of
great
worth
and
good
breeding
called
messer
lizio
da
valbona
to
whom
well
nigh
in
his
old
age
it
chanced
there
was
born
of
his
wife
madam
giacomina
by
name
a
daughter
who
grew
up
fair
and
agreeable
beyond
any
other
of
the
country
and
for
that
she
was
the
only
child
that
remained
to
her
father
and
mother
they
loved
and
tendered
her
exceeding
dear
and
guarded
her
with
marvellous
diligence
looking
to
make
some
great
alliance
by
her
now
there
was
a
young
man
of
the
manardi
of
brettinoro
comely
and
lusty
of
his
person
by
name
ricciardo
who
much
frequented
messer
lizio
house
and
conversed
amain
with
him
and
of
whom
the
latter
and
his
lady
took
no
more
account
than
they
would
have
taken
of
a
son
of
theirs
now
this
ricciardo
looking
once
and
again
upon
the
young
lady
and
seeing
her
very
fair
and
sprightly
and
commendable
of
manners
and
fashions
fell
desperately
in
love
with
her
but
was
very
careful
to
keep
his
love
secret
the
damsel
presently
became
aware
thereof
and
without
anywise
seeking
to
shun
the
stroke
began
on
like
wise
to
love
him
whereat
ricciardo
was
mightily
rejoiced
he
had
many
a
time
a
mind
to
speak
to
her
but
kept
silence
of
misdoubtance
however
one
day
taking
courage
and
opportunity
he
said
to
her
prithee
caterina
cause
me
not
die
of
love
to
which
she
straightway
made
answer
god
thou
wouldst
not
cause
die
this
answer
added
much
courage
and
pleasure
to
ricciardo
and
he
said
to
her
shall
aught
that
may
be
agreeable
to
thee
miscarry
for
me
but
it
resteth
with
thee
to
find
a
means
of
saving
thy
life
and
mine
answered
she
seest
how
straitly
i
am
guarded
wherefore
for
my
part
i
can
not
see
how
thou
mayst
avail
to
come
at
me
but
if
thou
canst
see
aught
that
i
may
do
without
shame
to
myself
tell
it
me
and
i
will
do
it
ricciardo
having
bethought
himself
of
sundry
things
answered
promptly
sweet
caterina
i
can
see
no
way
except
that
thou
lie
or
make
shift
to
come
upon
the
gallery
that
adjoineth
thy
father
garden
where
an
i
knew
that
thou
wouldst
be
anights
i
would
without
fail
contrive
to
come
to
thee
how
high
soever
it
may
be
thou
have
the
heart
to
come
thither
rejoined
caterina
i
can
well
enough
win
to
be
there
ricciardo
assented
and
they
kissed
each
other
once
only
in
haste
and
went
their
ways
footnote
lit
stand
abide
undone
next
day
it
being
then
near
the
end
of
may
the
girl
began
to
complain
before
her
mother
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
that
night
for
the
excessive
heat
quoth
the
lady
what
heat
dost
thou
speak
daughter
nay
it
was
nowise
hot
mine
answered
caterina
should
say
to
my
seeming
and
belike
you
would
say
sooth
but
you
should
consider
how
much
hotter
are
young
girls
than
ladies
in
years
mine
rejoined
the
lady
is
true
but
i
can
not
make
it
cold
and
hot
at
my
pleasure
as
belike
thou
wouldst
have
me
do
we
must
put
up
with
the
weather
such
as
the
seasons
make
it
maybe
this
next
night
will
be
cooler
and
thou
wilt
sleep
better
grant
it
may
be
so
cried
caterina
it
is
not
usual
for
the
nights
to
go
cooling
as
it
groweth
towards
summer
what
wouldst
thou
have
done
asked
the
mother
and
she
answered
it
please
my
father
and
you
i
would
fain
have
a
little
bed
made
in
the
gallery
that
is
beside
his
chamber
and
over
his
garden
and
there
sleep
there
i
should
hear
the
nightingale
sing
and
having
a
cooler
place
to
lie
in
i
should
fare
much
better
than
in
your
chamber
quoth
the
mother
comfort
thyself
i
will
tell
thy
father
and
as
he
will
so
will
we
do
messer
lizio
hearing
all
this
from
his
wife
said
for
that
he
was
an
old
man
and
maybe
therefore
somewhat
nightingale
is
this
to
whose
song
she
would
sleep
i
will
yet
make
her
sleep
to
the
chirp
of
the
crickets
caterina
coming
to
know
this
more
of
despite
than
for
the
heat
not
only
slept
not
that
night
but
suffered
not
her
mother
to
sleep
still
complaining
of
the
great
heat
accordingly
next
morning
the
latter
repaired
to
her
husband
and
said
to
him
you
have
little
tenderness
for
yonder
girl
what
mattereth
it
to
you
if
she
lie
in
the
gallery
she
could
get
no
rest
all
night
for
the
heat
besides
can
you
wonder
at
her
having
a
mind
to
hear
the
nightingale
sing
seeing
she
is
but
a
child
young
folk
are
curious
of
things
like
themselves
messer
lizio
hearing
this
said
to
make
her
a
bed
there
such
as
you
think
fit
and
bind
it
about
with
some
curtain
or
other
and
there
let
her
lie
and
hear
the
nightingale
sing
to
her
heart
content
the
girl
learning
this
straightway
let
make
a
bed
in
the
gallery
and
meaning
to
lie
there
that
same
night
watched
till
she
saw
ricciardo
and
made
him
a
signal
appointed
between
them
by
which
he
understood
what
was
to
be
done
messer
lizio
hearing
the
girl
gone
to
bed
locked
a
door
that
led
from
his
chamber
into
the
gallery
and
betook
himself
likewise
to
sleep
as
for
ricciardo
as
soon
as
he
heard
all
quiet
on
every
hand
he
mounted
a
wall
with
the
aid
of
a
ladder
and
thence
laying
hold
of
certain
toothings
of
another
wall
he
made
his
way
with
great
toil
and
danger
if
he
had
fallen
up
to
the
gallery
where
he
was
quietly
received
by
the
girl
with
the
utmost
joy
then
after
many
kisses
they
went
to
bed
together
and
took
delight
and
pleasure
one
of
another
well
nigh
all
that
night
making
the
nightingale
sing
many
a
time
the
nights
being
short
and
the
delight
great
and
it
being
now
though
they
thought
it
not
near
day
they
fell
asleep
without
any
covering
so
overheated
were
they
what
with
the
weather
and
what
with
their
sport
caterina
having
her
right
arm
entwined
about
ricciardo
neck
and
holding
him
with
the
left
hand
by
that
thing
which
you
ladies
think
most
shame
to
name
among
men
as
they
slept
on
this
wise
without
awaking
the
day
came
on
and
messer
lizio
arose
and
remembering
him
that
his
daughter
lay
in
the
gallery
opened
the
door
softly
saying
in
himself
us
see
how
the
nightingale
hath
made
caterina
sleep
this
night
then
going
in
he
softly
lifted
up
the
serge
wherewith
the
bed
was
curtained
about
and
saw
his
daughter
and
ricciardo
lying
asleep
naked
and
uncovered
embraced
as
it
hath
before
been
set
out
whereupon
having
recognized
ricciardo
he
went
out
again
and
repairing
to
his
wife
chamber
called
to
her
saying
wife
get
thee
up
and
come
see
for
that
thy
daughter
hath
been
so
curious
of
the
nightingale
that
she
hath
taken
it
and
hath
it
in
hand
can
that
be
quoth
she
and
he
answered
shalt
see
it
an
thou
come
quickly
accordingly
she
made
haste
to
dress
herself
and
quietly
followed
her
husband
to
the
bed
where
the
curtain
being
drawn
madam
giacomina
might
plainly
see
how
her
daughter
had
taken
and
held
the
nightingale
which
she
had
so
longed
to
hear
sing
whereat
the
lady
holding
herself
sore
deceived
of
ricciardo
would
have
cried
out
and
railed
at
him
but
messer
lizio
said
to
her
as
thou
holdest
my
love
dear
look
thou
say
not
a
word
for
verily
since
she
hath
gotten
it
it
shall
be
hers
ricciardo
is
young
and
rich
and
gently
born
he
can
not
make
us
other
than
a
good
an
he
would
part
from
me
on
good
terms
needs
must
he
first
marry
her
so
it
will
be
found
that
he
hath
put
the
nightingale
in
his
own
cage
and
not
in
that
of
another
the
lady
was
comforted
to
see
that
her
husband
was
not
angered
at
the
matter
and
considering
that
her
daughter
had
passed
a
good
night
and
rested
well
and
had
caught
the
nightingale
to
boot
she
held
her
tongue
nor
had
they
abidden
long
after
these
words
when
ricciardo
awoke
and
seeing
that
it
was
broad
day
gave
himself
over
for
lost
and
called
caterina
saying
my
soul
how
shall
we
do
for
the
day
is
come
and
hath
caught
me
here
whereupon
messer
lizio
came
forward
and
lifting
the
curtain
answered
shall
do
well
when
ricciardo
saw
him
himseemed
the
heart
was
torn
out
of
his
body
and
sitting
up
in
bed
he
said
lord
i
crave
your
pardon
for
god
sake
i
acknowledged
to
have
deserved
death
as
a
disloyal
and
wicked
man
wherefore
do
you
with
me
as
best
pleaseth
you
but
i
prithee
an
it
may
be
have
mercy
on
my
life
and
let
me
not
die
answered
messer
lizio
love
that
i
bore
thee
and
the
faith
i
had
in
thee
merited
not
this
return
yet
since
thus
it
is
and
youth
hath
carried
thee
away
into
such
a
fault
do
thou
to
save
thyself
from
death
and
me
from
shame
take
caterina
to
thy
lawful
wife
so
that
like
as
this
night
she
hath
been
thine
she
may
be
thine
so
long
as
she
shall
live
on
this
wise
thou
mayst
gain
my
pardon
and
thine
own
safety
but
an
thou
choose
not
to
do
this
commend
thy
soul
to
god
whilst
these
words
were
saying
caterina
let
go
the
nightingale
and
covering
herself
fell
to
weeping
sore
and
beseeching
her
father
to
pardon
ricciardo
whilst
on
the
other
hand
she
entreated
her
lover
to
do
as
messer
lizio
wished
so
they
might
long
pass
such
nights
together
in
security
but
there
needed
not
overmany
prayers
for
that
on
the
one
hand
shame
of
the
fault
committed
and
desire
to
make
amends
for
it
and
on
the
other
the
fear
of
death
and
the
wish
to
escape
to
say
nothing
of
his
ardent
love
and
longing
to
possess
the
thing
beloved
made
ricciardo
freely
and
without
hesitation
avouch
himself
ready
to
do
that
which
pleased
messer
lizio
whereupon
the
latter
borrowed
of
madam
giacomina
one
of
her
rings
and
there
without
budging
ricciardo
in
their
presence
took
caterina
to
his
wife
this
done
messer
lizio
and
his
lady
departed
saying
rest
yourselves
for
belike
you
have
more
need
thereof
than
of
rising
they
being
gone
the
young
folk
clipped
each
other
anew
and
not
having
run
more
than
half
a
dozen
courses
overnight
they
ran
other
twain
ere
they
arose
and
so
made
an
end
of
the
first
day
tilting
then
they
arose
and
ricciardo
having
had
more
orderly
conference
with
messer
lizio
a
few
days
after
as
it
beseemed
he
married
the
damsel
over
again
in
the
presence
of
their
friends
and
kinsfolk
and
brought
her
with
great
pomp
to
his
own
house
there
he
held
goodly
and
honourable
nuptials
and
after
went
long
with
her
to
his
heart
content
in
peace
and
solace
both
by
night
and
by
day
the
fifth
story
day
the
fifth
guidotto
da
cremona
leaveth
to
giacomino
da
pavia
a
daughter
of
his
and
dieth
giannole
di
severino
and
minghino
di
mingole
fall
in
love
with
the
girl
at
faenza
and
come
to
blows
on
her
account
ultimately
she
is
proved
to
be
giannole
sister
and
is
given
to
minghino
to
wife
all
the
ladies
hearkening
to
the
story
of
the
nightingale
had
laughed
so
much
that
though
filostrato
had
made
an
end
of
telling
they
could
not
yet
give
over
laughing
but
after
they
had
laughed
awhile
the
queen
said
to
filostrato
assuredly
if
thou
afflictedest
us
ladies
yesterday
thou
hast
so
tickled
us
that
none
of
us
can
deservedly
complain
of
thee
then
addressing
herself
to
neifile
she
charged
her
tell
and
she
blithely
began
to
speak
thus
since
filostrato
discoursing
hath
entered
into
romagna
it
pleaseth
me
on
like
wise
to
go
ranging
awhile
therein
with
mine
own
story
i
say
then
that
there
dwelt
once
in
the
city
of
fano
two
lombards
whereof
the
one
was
called
guidotto
da
cremona
and
the
other
giacomino
da
pavia
both
men
advanced
in
years
who
had
in
their
youth
been
well
nigh
always
soldiers
and
engaged
in
deeds
of
arms
guidotto
being
at
the
point
of
death
and
having
nor
son
nor
other
kinsmen
nor
friend
in
whom
he
trusted
more
than
in
giacomino
left
him
a
little
daughter
he
had
of
maybe
ten
years
of
age
and
all
that
he
possessed
in
the
world
and
after
having
bespoken
him
at
length
of
his
affairs
he
died
in
those
days
it
befell
that
the
city
of
faenza
which
had
been
long
in
war
and
ill
case
was
restored
to
somewhat
better
estate
and
permission
to
sojourn
there
was
freely
conceded
to
all
who
had
a
mind
to
return
thither
wherefore
giacomino
who
had
abidden
there
otherwhile
and
had
a
liking
for
the
place
returned
thither
with
all
his
good
and
carried
with
him
the
girl
left
him
by
guidotto
whom
he
loved
and
entreated
as
his
own
child
the
latter
grew
up
and
became
as
fair
a
damsel
as
any
in
the
city
ay
and
as
virtuous
and
well
bred
as
she
was
fair
wherefore
she
began
to
be
courted
of
many
but
especially
two
very
agreeable
young
men
of
equal
worth
and
condition
vowed
her
a
very
great
love
insomuch
that
for
jealousy
they
came
to
hold
each
other
in
hate
out
of
measure
they
were
called
the
one
giannole
di
severino
and
the
other
minghino
di
mingole
nor
was
there
either
of
them
but
would
gladly
have
taken
the
young
lady
who
was
now
fifteen
years
old
to
wife
had
it
been
suffered
of
his
kinsfolk
wherefore
seeing
her
denied
to
them
on
honourable
wise
each
cast
about
to
get
her
for
himself
as
best
he
might
now
giacomino
had
in
his
house
an
old
and
a
crivello
by
name
a
very
merry
and
obliging
person
with
whom
giannole
clapped
up
a
great
acquaintance
and
to
whom
whenas
himseemed
time
he
discovered
his
passion
praying
him
to
be
favourable
to
him
in
his
endeavour
to
obtain
his
desire
and
promising
him
great
things
an
he
did
this
whereto
quoth
crivello
you
i
can
do
nought
for
thee
in
this
matter
other
than
that
when
next
giacomino
goeth
abroad
to
supper
i
will
bring
thee
whereas
she
may
be
for
that
an
i
offered
to
say
a
word
to
her
in
thy
favour
she
would
never
stop
to
listen
to
me
if
this
like
thee
i
promise
it
to
thee
and
will
do
it
and
do
thou
after
an
thou
know
how
that
which
thou
deemest
shall
best
serve
thy
purpose
giannole
answered
that
he
desired
nothing
more
and
they
abode
on
this
understanding
meanwhile
minghino
on
his
part
had
suborned
the
maidservant
and
so
wrought
with
her
that
she
had
several
times
carried
messages
to
the
girl
and
had
well
night
inflamed
her
with
love
of
him
besides
which
she
had
promised
him
to
bring
him
in
company
with
her
so
soon
as
giacomino
should
chance
to
go
abroad
of
an
evening
for
whatever
cause
not
long
after
this
it
chanced
that
by
crivello
contrivance
giacomino
went
to
sup
with
a
friend
of
his
whereupon
crivello
gave
giannole
to
know
thereof
and
appointed
with
him
that
whenas
he
made
a
certain
signal
he
should
come
and
would
find
the
door
open
the
maid
on
her
side
knowing
nothing
of
all
this
let
minghino
know
that
giacomino
was
to
sup
abroad
and
bade
him
abide
near
the
house
so
that
whenas
he
saw
a
signal
which
she
should
make
he
might
come
and
enter
therein
the
evening
come
the
two
lovers
knowing
nothing
of
each
other
designs
but
each
misdoubting
of
his
rival
came
with
sundry
companions
armed
to
enter
into
possession
minghino
with
his
troop
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
a
neighbour
of
the
young
lady
whilst
giannole
and
his
friends
stationed
themselves
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
meanwhile
crivello
and
the
maid
giacomino
being
gone
studied
each
to
send
the
other
away
quoth
he
to
her
dost
thou
not
get
thee
to
bed
why
goest
thou
still
wandering
about
the
house
thou
retorted
she
goest
thou
not
for
thy
master
what
awaitest
thou
here
now
that
thou
hast
supped
and
so
neither
could
make
other
avoid
the
place
but
crivello
seeing
the
hour
come
that
he
had
appointed
with
giannole
said
in
himself
reck
i
of
her
an
she
abide
not
quiet
she
is
like
to
smart
for
it
accordingly
giving
the
appointed
signal
he
went
to
open
the
door
whereupon
giannole
coming
up
in
haste
with
two
companions
entered
and
finding
the
young
lady
in
the
saloon
laid
hands
on
her
to
carry
her
off
the
girl
began
to
struggle
and
make
a
great
outcry
as
likewise
did
the
maid
which
minghino
hearing
he
ran
thither
with
his
companions
and
seeing
the
young
lady
being
presently
dragged
out
at
the
door
they
pulled
out
their
swords
and
cried
all
traitors
ye
are
dead
men
the
thing
shall
not
go
thus
what
is
this
violence
so
saying
they
fell
to
hewing
at
them
whilst
the
neighbors
issuing
forth
at
the
clamour
with
lights
and
arms
began
to
blame
behaviour
and
to
second
minghino
wherefore
after
long
contention
the
latter
rescued
the
young
lady
from
his
rival
and
restored
her
to
giacomino
house
but
before
the
fray
was
over
up
came
the
officers
and
arrested
many
of
them
and
amongst
the
rest
minghino
and
giannole
and
crivello
were
taken
and
carried
off
to
prison
after
matters
were
grown
quiet
again
giacomino
returned
home
and
was
sore
chagrined
at
that
which
had
happened
but
enquiring
how
it
had
come
about
and
finding
that
the
girl
was
nowise
at
fault
he
was
somewhat
appeased
and
determined
in
himself
to
marry
her
as
quickliest
he
might
so
the
like
should
not
again
betide
next
morning
the
kinsfolk
of
the
two
young
men
hearing
the
truth
of
the
case
and
knowing
the
ill
that
might
ensue
thereof
for
the
imprisoned
youths
should
giacomino
choose
to
do
that
which
he
reasonably
might
repaired
to
him
and
prayed
him
with
soft
words
to
have
regard
not
so
much
to
the
affront
which
he
had
suffered
from
the
little
sense
of
the
young
men
as
to
the
love
and
goodwill
which
they
believed
he
bore
to
themselves
who
thus
besought
him
submitting
themselves
and
the
young
men
who
had
done
the
mischief
to
any
amends
it
should
please
him
take
giacomino
who
had
in
his
time
seen
many
things
and
was
a
man
of
sense
answered
briefly
were
i
in
mine
own
country
as
i
am
in
yours
i
hold
myself
so
much
your
friend
that
neither
in
this
nor
in
otherwhat
would
i
do
aught
save
insomuch
as
it
should
please
you
besides
i
am
the
more
bounden
to
comply
with
your
wishes
in
this
matter
inasmuch
as
you
have
therein
offended
against
yourselves
for
that
the
girl
in
question
is
not
as
belike
many
suppose
of
cremona
nor
of
pavia
nay
she
is
a
faentine
albeit
neither
i
nor
she
nor
he
of
whom
i
had
her
might
ever
learn
whose
daughter
she
was
wherefore
concerning
that
whereof
you
pray
me
so
much
shall
be
done
by
me
as
you
yourselves
shall
enjoin
me
footnote
a
native
of
faenza
the
gentlemen
hearing
this
marvelled
and
returning
thanks
to
giacomino
for
his
gracious
answer
prayed
him
that
it
would
please
him
tell
them
how
she
came
to
his
hands
and
how
he
knew
her
to
be
a
faentine
whereto
quoth
he
da
cremona
who
was
my
friend
and
comrade
told
me
on
his
deathbed
that
when
this
city
was
taken
by
the
emperor
frederick
and
everything
given
up
to
pillage
he
entered
with
his
companions
into
a
house
and
found
it
full
of
booty
but
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
save
only
this
girl
who
was
then
some
two
years
old
or
thereabouts
and
who
seeing
him
mount
the
stairs
called
him
father
whereupon
taking
compassion
upon
her
he
carried
her
off
with
him
to
fano
together
with
all
that
was
in
the
house
and
dying
there
left
her
to
me
with
what
he
had
charging
me
marry
her
in
due
time
and
give
her
to
her
dowry
that
which
had
been
hers
since
she
hath
come
to
marriageable
age
i
have
not
yet
found
an
occasion
of
marrying
her
to
my
liking
though
i
would
gladly
do
it
rather
than
that
another
mischance
like
that
of
yesternight
should
betide
me
on
her
account
now
among
the
others
there
was
a
certain
guiglielmino
da
medicina
who
had
been
with
guidotto
in
that
affair
and
knew
very
well
whose
house
it
was
that
he
had
plundered
and
he
seeing
the
person
in
question
there
among
the
rest
accosted
him
saying
hearest
thou
what
giacomino
saith
do
i
answered
bernabuccio
i
was
presently
in
thought
thereof
more
by
token
that
i
mind
me
to
have
lost
a
little
daughter
of
the
age
whereof
giacomino
speaketh
in
those
very
troubles
quoth
guiglielmino
is
she
for
certain
for
that
i
was
once
in
company
with
guidotto
when
i
heard
him
tell
where
he
had
done
the
plundering
and
knew
it
to
be
thy
house
that
he
had
sacked
wherefore
do
thou
bethink
thee
if
thou
mayst
credibly
recognize
her
by
any
token
and
let
make
search
therefor
for
thou
wilt
assuredly
find
that
she
is
thy
daughter

the
owner
of
the
plundered
house
accordingly
bernabuccio
bethought
himself
and
remembered
that
she
should
have
a
little
scar
over
her
left
ear
proceeding
from
a
tumour
which
he
had
caused
cut
for
her
no
great
while
before
that
occurrence
whereupon
without
further
delay
he
accosted
giacomino
who
was
still
there
and
besought
him
to
carry
him
to
his
house
and
let
him
see
the
damsel
to
this
he
readily
consented
and
carrying
him
thither
let
bring
the
girl
before
him
when
bernabuccio
set
eyes
on
her
himseemed
he
saw
the
very
face
of
her
mother
who
was
yet
a
handsome
lady
nevertheless
not
contenting
himself
with
this
he
told
giacomino
that
he
would
fain
of
his
favour
have
leave
to
raise
her
hair
a
little
above
her
left
ear
to
which
the
other
consented
accordingly
going
up
to
the
girl
who
stood
shamefast
he
lifted
up
her
hair
with
his
right
hand
and
found
the
cross
whereupon
knowing
her
to
be
indeed
his
daughter
he
fell
to
weeping
tenderly
and
embracing
her
notwithstanding
her
resistance
then
turning
to
giacomino
mine
quoth
he
is
my
daughter
it
was
my
house
guidotto
plundered
and
this
girl
was
in
the
sudden
alarm
forgotten
there
of
my
wife
and
her
mother
and
until
now
we
believed
that
she
had
perished
with
the
house
which
was
burned
me
that
same
day
the
girl
hearing
this
and
seeing
him
to
be
a
man
in
years
gave
credence
to
his
words
and
submitting
herself
to
his
embraces
as
moved
by
some
occult
instinct
fell
tenderly
with
him
bernabuccio
presently
sent
for
her
mother
and
other
her
kinswomen
and
for
her
sisters
and
brothers
and
presented
her
to
them
all
recounting
the
matter
to
them
then
after
a
thousand
embraces
he
carried
her
home
to
his
house
with
the
utmost
rejoicing
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
giacomino
the
who
was
a
man
of
worth
learning
this
and
knowing
that
giannole
whom
he
had
in
prison
was
bernabuccio
son
and
therefore
the
lady
own
brother
determined
indulgently
to
overpass
the
offence
committed
by
him
and
released
with
him
minghino
and
crivello
and
the
others
who
were
implicated
in
the
affair
moreover
he
interceded
with
bernabuccio
and
giacomino
concerning
these
matters
and
making
peace
between
the
two
young
men
gave
the
girl
whose
name
was
agnesa
to
minghino
to
wife
to
the
great
contentment
of
all
their
kinsfolk
whereupon
minghino
mightily
rejoiced
made
a

to

with
a
story
of
an
enamoured
youth
ischia
is
an
island
very
near
naples
and
therein
among
others
was
once
a
very
fair
and
sprightly
damsel
by
name
restituta
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
of
the
island
called
marino
bolgaro
and
whom
a
youth
named
gianni
a
native
of
a
little
island
near
ischia
called
procida
loved
more
than
his
life
as
she
on
like
wise
loved
him
not
only
did
he
come
by
day
from
procida
to
see
her
but
oftentimes
anights
not
finding
a
boat
he
had
swum
from
procida
to
ischia
at
the
least
to
look
upon
the
walls
of
her
house
an
he
might
no
otherwise
during
the
continuance
of
this
so
ardent
love
it
befell
that
the
girl
being
all
alone
one
summer
day
on
the
chanced
as
she
went
from
rock
to
rock
loosening
from
the
stones
with
a
knife
upon
a
place
hidden
among
the
cliffs
where
at
once
for
shade
and
for
the
commodity
of
a
spring
of
very
cool
water
that
was
there
certain
young
men
of
sicily
coming
from
naples
had
taken
up
their
quarters
with
a
pinnace
they
had
they
seeing
that
she
was
alone
and
very
handsome
and
was
yet
unaware
of
them
took
counsel
together
to
seize
her
and
carry
her
off
and
put
their
resolve
into
execution
accordingly
they
took
her
for
all
she
made
a
great
outcry
and
carrying
her
aboard
the
pinnace
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
calabria
where
they
fell
to
disputing
of
whose
she
should
be
brief
each
would
fain
have
her
wherefore
being
unable
to
agree
among
themselves
and
fearing
to
come
to
worse
and
to
mar
their
affairs
for
her
they
took
counsel
together
to
present
her
to
frederick
king
of
sicily
who
was
then
a
young
man
and
delighted
in
such
toys
accordingly
coming
to
palermo
they
made
gift
of
the
damsel
to
the
king
who
seeing
her
to
be
fair
held
her
dear
but
for
that
he
was
presently
somewhat
infirm
of
his
person
he
commanded
that
against
he
should
be
stronger
she
should
be
lodged
in
a
very
goodly
pavilion
belonging
to
a
garden
of
his
he
called
la
cuba
and
there
tended
and
so
it
was
done
great
was
the
outcry
in
ischia
for
the
ravishment
of
the
damsel
and
what
most
chagrined
them
was
that
they
could
not
learn
who
they
were
that
had
carried
her
off
but
gianni
whom
the
thing
concerned
more
than
any
other
not
looking
to
get
any
news
of
this
in
ischia
and
learning
in
what
direction
the
ravishers
had
gone
equipped
another
pinnace
and
embarking
therein
as
quickliest
as
he
might
scoured
all
the
coast
from
la
minerva
to
la
scalea
in
calabria
enquiring
everywhere
for
news
of
the
girl
being
told
at
la
scalea
that
she
had
been
carried
off
to
palermo
by
some
sicilian
sailors
he
betook
himself
thither
as
quickliest
he
might
and
there
after
much
search
finding
that
she
had
been
presented
to
the
king
and
was
by
him
kept
under
ward
at
la
cuba
he
was
sore
chagrined
and
lost
well
nigh
all
hope
not
only
of
ever
having
her
again
but
even
of
seeing
her
nevertheless
detained
by
love
having
sent
away
his
pinnace
and
seeing
that
he
was
known
of
none
there
he
abode
behind
and
passing
often
by
la
cuba
he
chanced
one
day
to
catch
sight
of
her
at
a
window
and
she
saw
him
to
the
great
contentment
of
them
both
gianni
seeing
the
place
lonely
approached
as
most
he
might
and
bespeaking
her
was
instructed
by
her
how
he
must
do
an
he
would
thereafterward
have
further
speech
of
her
he
then
took
leave
of
her
having
first
particularly
examined
the
ordinance
of
the
place
in
every
part
and
waited
till
a
good
part
of
the
night
was
past
when
he
returned
thither
and
clambering
up
in
places
where
a
woodpecker
had
scarce
found
a
foothold
he
made
his
way
into
the
garden
there
he
found
a
long
pole
and
setting
it
against
the
window
which
his
mistress
had
shown
him
climbed
up
thereby
lightly
enough
the
damsel
herseeming
she
had
already
lost
her
honour
for
the
preservation
whereof
she
had
in
times
past
been
somewhat
coy
to
him
thinking
that
she
could
give
herself
to
none
more
worthily
than
to
him
and
doubting
not
to
be
able
to
induce
him
to
carry
her
off
had
resolved
in
herself
to
comply
with
him
in
every
his
desire
wherefore
she
had
left
the
window
open
so
he
might
enter
forthright
accordingly
gianni
finding
it
open
softly
made
his
way
into
the
chamber
and
laid
himself
beside
the
girl
who
slept
not
and
who
before
they
came
to
otherwhat
discovered
to
him
all
her
intent
instantly
beseeching
him
to
take
her
thence
and
carry
her
away
gianni
answered
that
nothing
could
be
so
pleasing
to
him
as
this
and
promised
that
he
would
without
fail
as
soon
as
he
should
have
taken
his
leave
of
her
put
the
matter
in
train
on
such
wise
that
he
might
carry
her
away
with
him
the
first
time
he
returned
thither
then
embracing
each
other
with
exceeding
pleasure
they
took
that
delight
beyond
which
love
can
afford
no
greater
and
after
reiterating
it
again
and
again
they
fell
asleep
without
perceiving
it
in
each
other
arms
meanwhile
the
king
who
had
at
first
sight
been
greatly
taken
with
the
damsel
calling
her
to
mind
and
feeling
himself
well
of
body
determined
albeit
it
was
nigh
upon
day
to
go
and
abide
with
her
awhile
accordingly
he
betook
himself
privily
to
la
cuba
with
certain
of
his
servants
and
entering
the
pavilion
caused
softly
open
the
chamber
wherein
he
knew
the
girl
slept
then
with
a
great
lighted
flambeau
before
him
he
entered
therein
and
looking
upon
the
bed
saw
her
and
gianni
lying
asleep
and
naked
in
each
other
arms
whereas
he
was
of
a
sudden
furiously
incensed
and
flamed
up
into
such
a
passion
of
wrath
that
it
lacked
of
little
but
he
had
without
saying
a
word
slain
them
both
then
and
there
with
a
dagger
he
had
by
his
side
however
esteeming
it
a
very
base
thing
of
any
man
much
more
a
king
to
slay
two
naked
folk
in
their
sleep
he
contained
himself
and
determined
to
put
them
to
death
in
public
and
by
fire
wherefore
turning
to
one
only
companion
he
had
with
him
he
said
to
him
deemest
thou
of
this
vile
woman
on
whom
i
had
set
my
hope
and
after
he
asked
him
if
he
knew
the
young
man
who
had
dared
enter
his
house
to
do
him
such
an
affront
and
such
an
outrage
but
he
answered
that
he
remembered
not
ever
to
have
seen
him
the
king
then
departed
the
chamber
full
of
rage
and
commanded
that
the
two
lovers
should
be
taken
and
bound
naked
as
they
were
and
that
as
soon
as
it
was
broad
day
they
should
be
carried
to
palermo
and
there
bound
to
a
stake
back
to
back
in
the
public
place
where
they
should
be
kept
till
the
hour
of
tierce
so
they
might
be
seen
of
all
and
after
burnt
even
as
they
had
deserved
and
this
said
he
returned
to
his
palace
at
palermo
exceeding
wroth
the
king
gone
there
fell
many
upon
the
two
lovers
and
not
only
awakened
them
but
forthright
without
any
pity
took
them
and
bound
them
which
when
they
saw
it
may
lightly
be
conceived
if
they
were
woeful
and
feared
for
their
lives
and
wept
and
made
moan
according
to
the
king
commandment
they
were
carried
to
palermo
and
bound
to
a
stake
in
the
public
place
whilst
the
faggots
and
the
fire
were
made
ready
before
their
eyes
to
burn
them
at
the
hour
appointed
thither
straightway
flocked
all
the
townsfolk
both
men
and
women
to
see
the
two
lovers
the
men
all
pressed
to
look
upon
the
damsel
and
like
as
they
praised
her
for
fair
and
well
made
in
every
part
of
her
body
even
so
on
the
other
hand
the
women
who
all
ran
to
gaze
upon
the
young
man
supremely
commended
him
for
handsome
and
well
shapen
but
the
wretched
lovers
both
sore
ashamed
stood
with
bowed
heads
and
bewailed
their
sorry
fortune
hourly
expecting
the
cruel
death
by
fire
whilst
they
were
thus
kept
against
the
appointed
hour
the
default
of
them
committed
being
bruited
about
everywhere
came
to
the
ears
of
ruggieri
dell
oria
a
man
of
inestimable
worth
and
then
the
admiral
whereupon
he
repaired
to
the
place
where
they
were
bound
and
considering
first
the
girl
commended
her
amain
for
beauty
then
turning
to
look
upon
the
young
man
knew
him
without
much
difficulty
and
drawing
nearer
to
him
asked
him
if
he
were
not
gianni
di
procida
the
youth
raising
his
eyes
and
recognizing
the
admiral
answered
lord
i
was
indeed
he
of
whom
you
ask
but
i
am
about
to
be
no
more
the
admiral
then
asked
him
what
had
brought
him
to
that
pass
and
he
answered
and
the
king
anger
the
admiral
caused
him
tell
his
story
more
at
large
and
having
heard
everything
from
him
as
it
had
happened
was
about
to
depart
when
gianni
called
him
back
and
said
to
him
god
sake
my
lord
an
it
may
be
get
me
one
favour
of
him
who
maketh
me
to
abide
thus
is
that
asked
ruggieri
and
gianni
said
see
i
must
die
and
that
speedily
and
i
ask
therefore
by
way
of
favour
as
i
am
bound
with
my
back
to
this
damsel
whom
i
have
loved
more
than
my
life
even
as
she
hath
loved
me
and
she
with
her
back
to
me
that
we
may
be
turned
about
with
our
faces
one
to
the
other
so
that
dying
i
may
look
upon
her
face
and
get
me
gone
comforted
all
my
heart
answered
ruggieri
laughing
will
do
on
such
wise
that
thou
shalt
yet
see
her
till
thou
grow
weary
of
her
sight
then
taking
leave
of
him
he
charged
those
who
were
appointed
to
carry
the
sentence
into
execution
that
they
should
proceed
no
farther
therein
without
other
commandment
of
the
king
and
straightway
betook
himself
to
the
latter
to
whom
albeit
he
saw
him
sore
incensed
he
spared
not
to
speak
his
mind
saying
in
what
have
the
two
young
folk
offended
against
thee
whom
thou
hast
commanded
to
be
burned
yonder
in
the
public
place
the
king
told
him
and
ruggieri

gianni

was
a
sicilian
noble
to
whose
efforts

up

him

that
which

commanded
incontinent
that

before
him

by
way

as

happen
in

set
out

to
return
to

they
might
not

a

heavy
and

fled
into

apparently
a
without

house
attached
in
which
they
might
have
taken
shelter
from

and
the
young
lady
having
no
readier
shelter
took
refuge
in
a
little
old
hut
well
nigh
all
in
ruins
wherein
none
dwelt
and
there
huddled
together
under
a
small
piece
of
roof
that
yet
remained
whole
the
scantness

them
to
press
close

this
touching
was
the
means

somewhat
emboldening
their
minds
to
discover
the
amorous
desires
that
consumed
them
both

first
began
to

never

over
so

were
dear

from
these
words
they
came
to
taking
each
other
by
the
hands
and
pressing
them
and
from
that
to
clipping
and
after
to
kissing
it

still
the
while
and
in
short
not
to
recount
every
particular
the
weather
mended
not
before
they
had
known
the
utmost
delights
of

and
had
taken
order
to
have
their
pleasure
secretly
one
of
the
other
the
storm
ended
they
fared
on
to
the
gate
of
the
city
which
was
near
at
hand
and
there
awaiting
the
lady
returned
home
with
her
thereafter
with
very
discreet
and
secret
ordinance
they
foregathered
again
and
again
in
the
same
place
to
the
great
contentment
of
them
both
and
the
work
went
on
so
briskly
that
the
young
lady
became
with
child
which
was
sore
unwelcome
both
to
the
one
and
the
other
wherefore
she
used
many
arts
to
rid
herself
contrary

the
course
of
nature

her
burden
but
could
nowise
avail
to
accomplish
it
therewithal
pietro
fearing
for
his
life
bethought
himself
to
flee
and
told
her
to
which
she
answered
thou
depart
i
will
without
fail
kill
myself
whereupon
quoth
pietro
who
loved
her
exceedingly
mine
how
wilt
thou
have
me
abide
here
thy
pregnancy
will
discover
our
default
and
it
will
lightly
be
pardoned
unto
thee
but
i
poor
wretch
it
will
be
must
needs
bear
the
penalty
of
thy
sin
and
mine
own
replied
she
sin
must
indeed
be
discovered
but
be
assured
that
thine
will
never
be
known

thou
tell
not

thou
promisest

will
remain

the

as

she

her
being
with

seeing
that
for
the
waxing
of
her
body
she
might
no
longer
dissemble
it
one
day
discovered
her
case
to
her
mother
beseeching
her
with
many
tears
to
save
her
whereupon
the
lady
beyond
measure
woeful
gave
her
hard
words
galore
and
would
know
of
her
how
the
thing
had
come
about

no

might
come

pietro

her
a
story
of
her
own
devising
disguising
the
truth
in
other
forms
the
lady
believed
it
and
to
conceal
her
default
sent
her
away
to
a
country
house
of
theirs
there
the
time
of
her
delivery
coming
and
the
girl
crying
out
as
women
use
to
do
what
while
her
mother
never
dreamed
that
messer
amerigo
who
was
well
nigh
never
wont
to
do
so
should
come
thither
it
chanced
that
he
passed
on
his
return
from
hawking
by
the
chamber
where
his
daughter
lay
and
marvelling
at
the
outcry
she
made
suddenly
entered
the
chamber
and
demanded
what
was
to
do
the
lady
seeing
her
husband
come
unawares
started
up
all
woebegone
and
told
him
that
which
had
befallen
the
girl
but
he
less
easy
of
belief
than
his
wife
had
been
declared
that
it
could
not
be
true
that
she
knew
not
by
whom
she
was
with
child
and
would
altogether
know
who
he
was
adding
that
by
confessing
it
she
might
regain
his
favour
else
must
she
make
ready
to
die
without
mercy
the
lady
did
her
utmost
to
persuade
her
husband
to
abide
content
with
that
which
she
had
said
but
to
no
purpose
he
flew
out
into
a
passion
and
running
with
his
naked
sword
in
his
hand
at
his
daughter
who
what
while
her
mother
held
her
father
in
parley
had
given
birth
to
a
male
child
said
do
thou
discover
by
whom
the
child
was
begotten
or
thou
shalt
die
without
delay
the
girl
fearing
death
broke
her
promise
to
pietro
and
discovered
all
that
had
passed
between
him
and
her
which
when
the
gentleman
heard
he
fell
into
a
fury
of
anger
and
hardly
withheld
himself
from
slaying
her
however
after
he
had
said
to
her
that
which
his
rage
dictated
to
him
he
took
horse
again
and
returning
to
trapani
recounted
the
affront
that
pietro
had
done
him
to
a
certain
messer
currado
who
was
captain
there
for
the
king
the
latter
caused
forthright
seize
pietro
who
was
off
his
guard
and
put
him
to
the
torture
whereupon
he
confessed
all
and
being
a
few
days
after
sentenced
by
the
captain
to
be
flogged
through
the
city
and
after
strung
up
by
the
neck
messer
amerigo
whose
wrath
had
not
been
done
away
by
the
having
brought
pietro
to
death
in
order
that
one
and
the
same
hour
should
rid
the
earth
of
the
two
lovers
and
their
child
put
poison
in
a
hanap
with
wine
and
delivering
it
together
with
a
naked
poniard
to
a
of
his
said
to
him
these
two
things
to
violante
and
bid
her
on
my
part
forthright
take
which
she
will
of
these
two
deaths
poison
or
steel
else
will
i
have
her
burned
alive
even
as
she
hath
deserved
in
the
presence
of
as
many
townsfolk
as
be
here
this
done
thou
shalt
take
the
child
a
few
days
agone
born
of
her
and
dash
its
head
against
the
wall
and
after
cast
it
to
the
dogs
to
eat
this
barbarous
sentence
passed
by
the
cruel
father
upon
his
daughter
and
his
grandchild
the
servant
who
was
more
disposed
to
ill
than
to
good
went
off
upon
his
errand
meanwhile
pietro
as
he
was
carried
to
the
gallows
by
the
officers
being
scourged
of
them
the
while
passed
according
as
it
pleased
those
who
led
the
company
before
a
hostelry
wherein
were
three
noblemen
of
armenia
who
had
been
sent
by
the
king
of
that
country
ambassadors
to
rome
to
treat
with
the
pope
of
certain
matters
of
great
moment
concerning
a
crusade
that
was
about
to
be
undertaken
and
who
had
lighted
down
there
to
take
some
days
rest
and
refreshment
they
had
been
much
honoured
by
the
noblemen
of
trapani
and
especially
by
messer
amerigo
and
hearing
those
pass
who
led
pietro
they
came
to
a
window
to
see
now
pietro
was
all
naked
to
the
waist
with
his
hands
bounden
behind
his
back
and
one
of
the
three
ambassadors
a
man
of
great
age
and
authority
named
fineo
espied
on
his
breast
a
great
vermeil
spot
not
painted
but
naturally
imprinted
on
his
skin
after
the
fashion
of
what
women
here
call
seeing
this
there
suddenly
recurred
to
his
memory
a
son
of
his
who
had
been
carried
off
by
corsairs
fifteen
years
agone
upon
the
coast
of
lazistan
and
of
whom
he
had
never
since
been
able
to
learn
any
news
and
considering
the
age
of
the
poor
wretch
who
was
scourged
he
bethought
himself
that
if
his
son
were
alive
he
must
be
of
such
an
age
as
pietro
appeared
to
him
wherefore
he
began
to
suspect
by
that
token
that
it
must
be
he
and
bethought
himself
that
were
he
indeed
his
son
he
should
still
remember
him
of
his
name
and
that
of
his
father
and
of
the
armenian
tongue
accordingly
as
he
drew
near
he
called
out
saying
teodoro
pietro
hearing
this
straightway
lifted
up
his
head
and
fineo
speaking
in
armenian
said
to
him
countryman
art
thou
and
whose
son
the
sergeants
who
had
him
in
charge
halted
with
him
of
respect
for
the
nobleman
so
that
pietro
answered
saying
was
of
armenia
and
son
to
one
fineo
and
was
brought
hither
as
a
little
child
by
i
know
not
what
folk
fineo
hearing
this
knew
him
for
certain
to
be
the
son
whom
he
had
lost
wherefore
he
came
down
weeping
with
his
companions
and
ran
to
embrace
him
among
all
the
sergeants
then
casting
over
his
shoulders
a
mantle
of
the
richest
silk
which
he
had
on
his
own
back
he
besought
the
officer
who
was
escorting
him
to
execution
to
be
pleased
to
wait
there
till
such
time
as
commandment
should
come
to
him
to
carry
the
prisoner
back
to
which
he
answered
that
he
would
well
now
fineo
had
already
learned
the
reason
for
which
pietro
was
being
led
to
death
report
having
noised
it
abroad
everywhere
wherefore
he
straightway
betook
himself
with
his
companions
and
their
retinue
to
messer
currado
and
bespoke
him
thus
he
whom
you
have
doomed
to
die
as
a
slave
is
a
free
man
and
my
son
and
is
ready
to
take
to
wife
her
whom
it
is
said
he
hath
bereft
of
her
maidenhead
wherefore
may
it
please
you
to
defer
the
execution
till
such
time
as
it
may
be
learned
if
she
will
have
him
to
husband
so
in
case
she
be
willing
you
may
not
be
found
to
have
done
contrary
to
the
law
messer
currado
hearing
that
the
condemned
man
was
fineo
son
marvelled
and
confessing
that
which
the
latter
said
to
be
true
was
somewhat
ashamed
of
the
unright
of
fortune
and
straightway
caused
carry
pietro
home
then
sending
for
messer
amerigo
he
acquainted
him
with
these
things
messer
amerigo
who
by
this
believed
his
daughter
and
grandson
to
be
dead
was
the
woefullest
man
in
the
world
for
that
which
he
had
done
seeing
that
all
might
very
well
have
been
set
right
so
but
violante
were
yet
alive
nevertheless
he
despatched
a
runner
whereas
his
daughter
was
to
the
intent
that
in
case
his
commandment
had
not
been
done
it
should
not
be
carried
into
effect
the
messenger
found
the
servant
sent
by
messer
amerigo
rating
the
lady
before
whom
he
had
laid
the
poniard
and
the
poison
for
that
she
made
not
her
election
as
speedily
as
he
desired
and
would
have
constrained
her
to
take
the
one
or
the
other
but
hearing
his
lord
commandment
he
let
her
be
and
returning
to
messer
amerigo
told
him
how
the
case
stood
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
latter
who
betaking
himself
whereas
fineo
was
excused
himself
well
nigh
with
tears
as
best
he
knew
of
that
which
had
passed
craving
pardon
therefor
and
evouching
that
an
teodoro
would
have
his
daughter
to
wife
he
was
exceeding
well
pleased
to
give
her
to
him
fineo
gladly
received
his
excuses
and
answered
is
my
intent
that
my
son
shall
take
your
daughter
to
wife
and
if
he
will
not
let
the
sentence
passed
upon
him
take
its
course
accordingly
being
thus
agreed
they
both
repaired
whereas
teodoro
abode
yet
all
fearful
of
death
albeit
he
was
rejoiced
to
have
found
his
father
again
and
questioned
him
of
his
mind
concerning
this
thing
when
he
heard
that
an
he
would
he
might
have
violante
to
wife
such
was
his
joy
that
himseemed
he
had
won
from
hell
to
heaven
at
one
bound
and
he
answered
that
this
would
be
to
him
the
utmost
of
favours
so
but
it
pleased
both
of
them
thereupon
they
sent
to
know
the
mind
of
the
young
lady
who
whereas
she
abode
in
expectation
of
death
the
woefullest
woman
alive
hearing
that
which
had
betided
and
was
like
to
betide
teodoro
after
much
parley
began
to
lend
some
faith
to
their
words
and
taking
a
little
comfort
answered
that
were
she
to
ensue
her
own
wishes
in
the
matter
no
greater
happiness
could
betide
her
than
to
be
the
wife
of
teodoro
algates
she
would
do
that
which
her
father
should
command
her
accordingly
all
parties
being
of
accord
the
two
lovers
were
married
with
the
utmost
magnificence
to
the
exceeding
satisfaction
of
all
the
townsfolk
and
the
young
lady
heartening
herself
and
letting
rear
her
little
son
became
ere
long
fairer
than
ever
then
being
risen
from
childbed
she
went
out
to
meet
fineo
whose
return
was
expected
from
rome
and
paid
him
reverence
as
to
a
father
whereupon
he
exceeding
well
pleased
to
have
so
fair
a
caused
celebrate
their
nuptials
with
the
utmost
pomp
and
rejoicing
and
receiving
her
as
a
daughter
ever
after
held
her
such
and
after
some
days
taking
ship
with
his
son
and
her
and
his
little
grandson
he
carried
them
with
him
into
lazistan
where
the
two
lovers
abode
in
peace
and
happiness
so
long
as
life
endured

them

which

may
prove
to
you
and
so
engage
you
altogether
to
purge
yourselves
therefrom
it
pleaseth
me
tell
you
a
story
no
less
pitiful
than
delectable
in
ravenna
a
very
ancient
city
of
romagna
there
were
aforetime
many
noblemen
and
gentlemen
and
amongst
the
rest
a
young
man
called
nastagio
degli
onesti
who
had
by
the
death
of
his
father
and
an
uncle
of
his
been
left
rich
beyond
all
estimation
and
who
as
it
happeneth
often
with
young
men
being
without
a
wife
fell
in
love
with
a
daughter
of
messer
paolo
traversari
a
young
lady
of
much
greater
family
than
his
own
hoping
by
his
fashions
to
bring
her
to
love
him
in
return
but
these
though
great
and
goodly
and
commendable
not
only
profited
him
nothing
nay
it
seemed
they
did
him
harm
so
cruel
and
obdurate
and
intractable
did
the
beloved
damsel
show
herself
to
him
being
grown
belike
whether
for
her
singular
beauty
or
the
nobility
of
her
birth
so
proud
and
disdainful
that
neither
he
nor
aught
that
pleased
him
pleased
her
this
was
so
grievous
to
nastagio
to
bear
that
many
a
time
for
chagrin
being
weary
of
complaining
he
had
it
in
his
thought
to
kill
himself
but
held
his
hand
therefrom
and
again
and
again
he
took
it
to
heart
to
let
her
be
altogether
or
have
her
an
he
might
in
hatred
even
as
she
had
him
but
in
vain
did
he
take
such
a
resolve
for
that
the
more
hope
failed
him
the
more
it
seemed
his
love
redoubled
accordingly
he
persisted
both
in
loving
and
in
spending
without
stint
or
measure
till
it
seemed
to
certain
of
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
that
he
was
like
to
consume
both
himself
and
his
substance
wherefore
they
besought
him
again
and
again
and
counselled
him
depart
ravenna
and
go
sojourn
awhile
in
some
other
place
for
that
so
doing
he
would
abate
both
his
passion
and
his
expenditure
nastagio
long
made
light
of
this
counsel
but
at
last
being
importuned
of
them
and
able
no
longer
to
say
no
he
promised
to
do
as
they
would
have
him
and
let
make
great
preparations
as
he
would
go
into
france
or
spain
or
some
other
far
place
then
taking
horse
in
company
with
many
of
his
friends
he
rode
out
of
ravenna
and
betook
himself
to
a
place
called
chiassi
some
three
miles
from
the
city
where
sending
for
tents
and
pavilions
he
told
those
who
had
accompanied
him
thither
that
he
meant
to
abide
and
that
they
might
return
to
ravenna
accordingly
having
encamped
there
he
proceeded
to
lead
the
goodliest
and
most
magnificent
life
that
was
aye
inviting
now
these
now
those
others
to
supper
and
to
dinner
as
he
was
used
it
chanced
one
day
he
being
come
thus
well
nigh
to
the
beginning
of
may
and
the
weather
being
very
fair
that
having
entered
into
thought
of
his
cruel
mistress
he
bade
all
his
servants
leave
him
to
himself
so
he
might
muse
more
at
his
leisure
and
wandered
on
step
by
step
lost
in
melancholy
thought
till
he
came
unwillingly
into
the
the
fifth
hour
of
the
day
was
well
nigh
past
and
he
had
gone
a
good
half
mile
into
the
wood
remembering
him
neither
of
eating
nor
of
aught
else
when
himseemed
of
a
sudden
he
heard
a
terrible
great
wailing
and
loud
cries
uttered
by
a
woman
whereupon
his
dulcet
meditation
being
broken
he
raised
his
head
to
see
what
was
to
do
and
marvelled
to
find
himself
among
the
pines
then
looking
before
him
he
saw
a
very
fair
damsel
come
running
naked
through
a
thicket
all
thronged
with
underwood
and
briers
towards
the
place
where
he
was
weeping
and
crying
sore
for
mercy
and
all
dishevelled
and
torn
by
the
bushes
and
the
brambles
at
her
heels
ran
two
huge
and
fierce
mastiffs
which
followed
hard
upon
her
and
ofttimes
bit
her
cruelly
whenas
they
overtook
her
and
after
them
he
saw
come
riding
upon
a
black
courser
a
knight
arrayed
in
armour
with
a
very
wrathful
aspect
and
a
tuck
in
his
hand
threatening
her
with
death
in
foul
and
fearsome
words
this
sight
filled
nastagio
mind
at
once
with
terror
and
amazement
and
after
stirred
him
to
compassion
of
the
lady
wherefrom
arose
a
desire
to
deliver
her
an
but
he
might
from
such
anguish
and
death
finding
himself
without
arms
he
ran
to
take
the
branch
of
a
tree
for
a
club
armed
wherewith
he
advanced
to
meet
the
dogs
and
the
knight
when
the
latter
saw
this
he
cried
out
to
him
from
afar
off
saying
meddle
not
suffer
the
dogs
and
myself
to
do
that
which
this
wicked
woman
hath
merited
as
he
spoke
the
dogs
laying
fast
hold
of
the
damsel
by
the
flanks
brought
her
to
a
stand
and
the
knight
coming
up
lighted
down
from
his
horse
whereupon
nastagio
drew
near
unto
him
and
said
know
not
who
thou
mayst
be
that
knowest
me
so
well
but
this
much
i
say
to
see
that
it
is
a
great
felony
for
an
armed
knight
to
seek
to
slay
a
naked
woman
and
to
set
the
dogs
on
her
as
she
were
a
wild
beast
certes
i
will
defend
her
as
most
i
may
answered
the
knight
was
of
one
same
city
with
thyself
and
thou
wast
yet
a
little
child
when
i
who
hight
messer
guido
degli
anastagi
was
yet
more
passionately
enamoured
of
this
woman
than
thou
art
presently
of
yonder
one
of
the
traversari
and
my
ill
fortune
for
her
and
barbarity
came
to
such
a
pass
that
one
day
i
slew
myself
in
despair
with
this
tuck
thou
seest
in
my
hand
and
was
doomed
to
eternal
punishment
nor
was
it
long
ere
she
who
was
beyond
measure
rejoiced
at
my
death
died
also
and
for
the
sin
of
her
cruelty
and
of
the
delight
had
of
her
in
my
torments
whereof
she
repented
her
not
as
one
who
thought
not
to
have
sinned
therein
but
rather
to
have
merited
reward
was
and
is
on
like
wise
condemned
to
the
pains
of
hell
wherein
no
sooner
was
she
descended
than
it
was
decreed
unto
her
and
to
me
for
penance
thereof
that
she
should
flee
before
me
and
that
i
who
once
loved
her
so
dear
should
pursue
her
not
as
a
beloved
mistress
but
as
a
mortal
enemy
and
that
as
often
as
i
overtook
her
i
should
slay
her
with
this
tuck
wherewith
i
slew
myself
and
ripping
open
her
loins
tear
from
her
body
as
thou
shalt
presently
see
that
hard
and
cold
heart
wherein
nor
love
nor
pity
might
ever
avail
to
enter
together
with
the
other
entrails
and
give
them
to
the
dogs
to
eat
nor
is
it
a
great
while
after
ere
as
justice
and
puissance
will
it
she
riseth
up
again
as
she
had
not
been
dead
and
beginneth
anew
her
woeful
flight
whilst
the
dogs
and
i
again
pursue
her
and
every
friday
it
betideth
that
i
come
up
with
her
here
at
this
hour
and
wreak
on
her
the
slaughter
that
thou
shalt
see
and
think
not
that
we
rest
the
other
days
nay
i
overtake
her
in
other
places
wherein
she
thought
and
wrought
cruelly
against
me
thus
being
as
thou
seest
from
her
lover
grown
her
foe
it
behoveth
me
pursue
her
on
this
wise
as
many
years
as
she
was
cruel
to
me
months
wherefore
leave
me
to
carry
the
justice
of
god
into
effect
and
seek
not
to
oppose
that
which
thou
mayst
not
avail
to
hinder
footnote
of
her
sin
nastagio
hearing
these
words
drew
back
grown
all
adread
with
not
an
hair
on
his
body
but
stood
on
end
and
looking
upon
the
wretched
damsel
began
fearfully
to
await
that
which
the
knight
should
do
the
latter
having
made
an
end
of
his
discourse
ran
tuck
in
hand
as
he
were
a
ravening
dog
at
the
damsel
who
fallen
on
her
knees
and
held
fast
by
the
two
mastiffs
cried
him
mercy
and
smiting
her
with
all
his
might
amiddleward
the
breast
pierced
her
through
and
through
no
sooner
had
she
received
this
stroke
than
she
fell
grovelling
on
the
ground
still
weeping
and
crying
out
whereupon
the
knight
clapping
his
hand
to
his
ripped
open
her
loins
and
tearing
forth
her
heart
and
all
that
was
thereabout
cast
them
to
the
two
mastiffs
who
devoured
them
incontinent
as
being
sore
anhungred
nor
was
it
long
ere
as
if
none
of
these
things
had
been
the
damsel
of
a
sudden
rose
to
her
feet
and
began
to
flee
towards
the
sea
with
the
dogs
after
her
still
rending
her
and
in
a
little
while
they
had
gone
so
far
that
nastagio
could
see
them
no
more
the
latter
seeing
these
things
abode
a
great
while
between
pity
and
fear
and
presently
it
occurred
to
his
mind
that
this
might
much
avail
him
seeing
that
it
befell
every
friday
wherefore
marking
the
place
he
returned
to
his
servants
and
after
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
fit
he
sent
for
sundry
of
his
kinsmen
and
friends
and
said
to
them
have
long
urged
me
leave
loving
this
mine
enemy
and
put
an
end
to
my
expenditure
and
i
am
ready
to
do
it
provided
you
will
obtain
me
a
favour
the
which
is
this
that
on
the
coming
friday
you
make
shift
to
have
messer
paolo
traversari
and
his
wife
and
daughter
and
all
their
kinswomen
and
what
other
ladies
soever
it
shall
please
you
here
to
dinner
with
me
that
for
which
i
wish
this
you
shall
see
then
this
seemed
to
them
a
little
thing
enough
to
do
wherefore
returning
to
ravenna
they
in
due
time
invited
those
whom
nastagio
would
have
to
dine
with
him
and
albeit
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
bring
thither
the
young
lady
whom
he
loved
natheless
she
went
with
the
other
ladies
meanwhile
nastagio
let
make
ready
a
magnificent
banquet
and
caused
set
the
tables
under
the
pines
round
about
the
place
where
he
had
witnessed
the
slaughter
of
the
cruel
lady
the
time
come
he
seated
the
gentlemen
and
the
ladies
at
table
and
so
ordered
it
that
his
mistress
should
be
placed
right
over
against
the
spot
where
the
thing
should
befall
accordingly
hardly
was
the
last
dish
come
when
the
despairful
outcry
of
the
hunted
damsel
began
to
be
heard
of
all
whereat
each
of
the
company
marvelled
and
enquired
what
was
to
do
but
none
could
say
whereupon
all
started
to
their
feet
and
looking
what
this
might
be
they
saw
the
woeful
damsel
and
the
knight
and
the
dogs
nor
was
it
long
ere
they
were
all
there
among
them
great
was
the
clamor
against
both
dogs
and
knight
and
many
rushed
forward
to
succour
the
damsel
but
the
knight
bespeaking
them
as
he
had
bespoken
nastagio
not
only
made
them
draw
back
but
filled
them
all
with
terror
and
amazement
then
did
he
as
he
had
done
before
whereat
all
the
ladies
that
were
there
and
there
were
many
present
who
had
been
kinswomen
both
to
the
woeful
damsel
and
to
the
knight
and
who
remembered
them
both
of
his
love
and
of
his
death
wept
as
piteously
as
if
they
had
seen
this
done
to
themselves
the
thing
carried
to
its
end
and
the
damsel
and
the
knight
gone
the
adventure
set
those
who
had
seen
it
upon
many
and
various
discourses
but
of
those
who
were
the
most
affrighted
was
the
cruel
damsel
beloved
of
nastagio
who
had
distinctly
seen
and
heard
the
whole
matter
and
understood
that
these
things
concerned
her
more
than
any
other
who
was
there
remembering
her
of
the
cruelty
she
had
still
used
towards
nastagio
wherefore
herseemed
she
fled
already
before
her
enraged
lover
and
had
the
mastiffs
at
her
heels
such
was
the
terror
awakened
in
her
thereby
that
so
this
might
not
betide
her
no
sooner
did
she
find
an
opportunity
which
was
afforded
her
that
same
evening
than
turning
her
hatred
into
love
she
despatched
to
nastagio
a
trusty
chamberwoman
of
hers
who
besought
him
that
it
should
please
him
to
go
to
her
for
that
she
was
ready
to
do
all
that
should
be
his
pleasure
he
answered
that
this
was
exceeding
agreeable
to
him
but
that
so
it
pleased
her
he
desired
to
have
his
pleasure
of
her
with
honour
to
wit
by
taking
her
to
wife
the
damsel
who
knew
that
it
rested
with
none
other
than
herself
that
she
had
not
been
his
wife
made
answer
to
him
that
it
liked
her
well
then
playing
the
messenger
herself
she
told
her
father
and
mother
that
she
was
content
to
be
wife
whereat
they
were
mightily
rejoiced
and
he
espousing
her
on
the
ensuing
sunday
and
celebrating
his
nuptials
lived
with
her
long
and
happily
nor
was
this
affright
the
cause
of
that
good
only
nay
all
the
ladies
of
ravenna
became
so
fearful
by
reason
thereof

ever
after
they
were
much
more
amenable

the

you
must
know
then
that
coppo
di
borghese
domenichi
who
was
of
our
days
and
maybe
is
yet
a
man
of
great
worship
and
authority
in
our
city
and
illustrious
and
worthy
of
eternal
renown
much
more
for
his
fashions
and
his
merit
than
for
the
nobility
of
his
blood
being
grown
full
of
years
delighted
oftentimes
to
discourse
with
his
neighbours
and
others
of
things
past
the
which
he
knew
how
to
do
better
and
more
orderly
and
with
more
memory
and
elegance
of
speech
than
any
other
man
amongst
other
fine
things
of
his
he
was
used
to
tell
that
there
was
once
in
florence
a
young
man
called
federigo
son
of
messer
filippo
alberighi
and
renowned
for
deeds
of
arms
and
courtesy
over
every
other
bachelor
in
tuscany
who
as
betideth
most
gentlemen
became
enamoured
of
a
gentlewoman
named
madam
giovanna
in
her
day
held
one
of
the
fairest
and
sprightliest
ladies
that
were
in
florence
and
to
win
her
love
he
held
jousts
and
tourneyings
and
made
entertainments
and
gave
gifts
and
spent
his
substance
without
any
stint
but
she
being
no
less
virtuous
than
fair
recked
nought
of
these
things
done
for
her
nor
of
him
who
did
them
federigo
spending
thus
far
beyond
his
means
and
gaining
nought
his
wealth
as
lightly
happeneth
in
course
of
time
came
to
an
end
and
he
abode
poor
nor
was
aught
left
him
but
a
poor
little
farm
on
whose
returns
he
lived
very
meagrely
and
to
boot
a
falcon
he
had
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
wherefore
being
more
in
love
than
ever
and
himseeming
he
might
no
longer
make
such
a
figure
in
the
city
as
he
would
fain
do
he
took
up
his
abode
at
campi
where
his
farm
was
and
there
bore
his
poverty
with
patience
hawking
whenas
he
might
and
asking
of
no
one
federigo
being
thus
come
to
extremity
it
befell
one
day
that
madam
giovanna
husband
fell
sick
and
seeing
himself
nigh
upon
death
made
his
will
wherein
being
very
rich
he
left
a
son
of
his
now
well
grown
his
heir
after
which
having
much
loved
madam
giovanna
he
substituted
her
to
his
heir
in
case
his
son
should
die
without
lawful
issue
and
died
madam
giovanna
being
thus
left
a
widow
betook
herself
that
summer
as
is
the
usance
of
our
ladies
into
the
country
with
her
son
to
an
estate
of
hers
very
near
that
of
federigo
wherefore
it
befell
that
the
lad
made
acquaintance
with
the
latter
and
began
to
take
delight
in
hawks
and
hounds
and
having
many
a
time
seen
his
falcon
flown
and
being
strangely
taken
therewith
longed
sore
to
have
it
but
dared
not
ask
it
of
him
seeing
it
so
dear
to
him
the
thing
standing
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lad
fell
sick
whereat
his
mother
was
sore
concerned
as
one
who
had
none
but
him
and
loved
him
with
all
her
might
and
abode
about
him
all
day
comforting
him
without
cease
and
many
a
time
she
asked
him
if
there
were
aught
he
desired
beseeching
him
tell
it
her
for
an
it
might
be
gotten
she
would
contrive
that
he
should
have
it
the
lad
having
heard
these
offers
many
times
repeated
said
mine
an
you
could
procure
me
to
have
federigo
falcon
methinketh
i
should
soon
be
whole
the
lady
hearing
this
bethought
herself
awhile
and
began
to
consider
how
she
should
do
she
knew
that
federigo
had
long
loved
her
and
had
never
gotten
of
her
so
much
as
a
glance
of
the
eye
wherefore
quoth
she
in
herself
shall
i
send
or
go
to
him
to
seek
of
him
this
falcon
which
is
by
all
i
hear
the
best
that
ever
flew
and
which
to
boot
maintaineth
him
in
the
world
and
how
can
i
be
so
graceless
as
to
offer
to
take
this
from
a
gentleman
who
hath
none
other
pleasure
left
perplexed
with
this
thought
and
knowing
not
what
to
say
for
all
she
was
very
certain
of
getting
the
bird
if
she
asked
for
it
she
made
no
reply
to
her
son
but
abode
silent
however
at
last
the
love
of
her
son
so
got
the
better
of
her
that
she
resolved
in
herself
to
satisfy
him
come
what
might
and
not
to
send
but
to
go
herself
for
the
falcon
and
fetch
it
to
him
accordingly
she
said
to
him
son
take
comfort
and
bethink
thyself
to
grow
well
again
for
i
promise
thee
that
the
first
thing
i
do
morning
i
will
go
for
it
and
fetch
it
to
thee
the
boy
was
rejoiced
at
this
and
showed
some
amendment
that
same
day
next
morning
the
lady
taking
another
lady
to
bear
her
company
repaired
by
way
of
diversion
to
federigo
little
house
and
enquired
for
the
latter
who
for
that
it
was
no
weather
for
hawking
nor
had
been
for
some
days
past
was
then
in
a
garden
he
had
overlooking
the
doing
of
certain
little
matters
of
his
and
hearing
that
madam
giovanna
asked
for
him
at
the
door
ran
thither
rejoicing
and
marvelling
exceedingly
she
seeing
him
come
rose
and
going
with
womanly
graciousness
to
meet
him
answered
his
respectful
salutation
with
you
good
day
federigo
then
went
on
to
say
am
come
to
make
thee
amends
for
that
which
thou
hast
suffered
through
me
in
loving
me
more
than
should
have
behooved
thee
and
the
amends
in
question
is
this
that
i
purpose
to
dine
with
thee
this
morning
familiarly
i
and
this
lady
my
companion
answered
federigo
humbly
remember
me
not
to
have
ever
received
any
ill
at
your
hands
but
on
the
contrary
so
much
good
that
if
ever
i
was
worth
aught
it
came
about
through
your
worth
and
the
love
i
bore
you
and
assuredly
albeit
you
have
come
to
a
poor
host
this
your
gracious
visit
is
far
more
precious
to
me
than
it
would
be
an
it
were
given
me
to
spend
over
again
as
much
as
that
which
i
have
spent
aforetime
so
saying
he
shamefastly
received
her
into
his
house
and
thence
brought
her
into
his
garden
where
having
none
else
to
bear
her
company
he
said
to
her
since
there
is
none
else
here
this
good
woman
wife
of
yonder
husbandman
will
bear
you
company
whilst
i
go
see
the
table
laid
never
till
that
moment
extreme
as
was
his
poverty
had
he
been
so
dolorously
sensible
of
the
straits
to
which
he
had
brought
himself
for
the
lack
of
those
riches
he
had
spent
on
such
disorderly
wise
but
that
morning
finding
he
had
nothing
wherewithal
he
might
honourably
entertain
the
lady
for
love
of
whom
he
had
aforetime
entertained
folk
without
number
he
was
made
perforce
aware
of
his
default
and
ran
hither
and
thither
perplexed
beyond
measure
like
a
man
beside
himself
inwardly
cursing
his
ill
fortune
but
found
neither
money
nor
aught
he
might
pawn
it
was
now
growing
late
and
he
having
a
great
desire
to
entertain
the
gentle
lady
with
somewhat
yet
choosing
not
to
have
recourse
to
his
own
labourer
much
less
any
one
else
his
eye
fell
on
his
good
falcon
which
he
saw
on
his
perch
in
his
little
saloon
whereupon
having
no
other
resource
he
took
the
bird
and
finding
him
fat
deemed
him
a
dish
worthy
of
such
a
lady
accordingly
without
more
ado
he
wrung
the
hawk
neck
and
hastily
caused
a
little
maid
of
his
pluck
it
and
truss
it
and
after
put
it
on
the
spit
and
roast
it
diligently
then
the
table
laid
and
covered
with
very
white
cloths
whereof
he
had
yet
some
store
he
returned
with
a
blithe
countenance
to
the
lady
in
the
garden
and
told
her
that
dinner
was
ready
such
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
provide
accordingly
the
lady
and
her
friend
arising
betook
themselves
to
table
and
in
company
with
federigo
who
served
them
with
the
utmost
diligence
ate
the
good
falcon
unknowing
what
they
did
presently
after
they
had
risen
from
table
and
had
abidden
with
him
awhile
in
cheerful
discourse
the
lady
thinking
it
time
to
tell
that
wherefor
she
was
come
turned
to
federigo
and
courteously
bespoke
him
saying
i
doubt
not
a
jot
but
that
when
thou
hearest
that
which
is
the
especial
occasion
of
my
coming
hither
thou
wilt
marvel
at
my
presumption
remembering
thee
of
thy
past
life
and
of
my
virtue
which
latter
belike
thou
reputedst
cruelty
and
hardness
of
heart
but
if
thou
hadst
or
hadst
had
children
by
whom
thou
mightest
know
how
potent
is
the
love
one
beareth
them
meseemeth
certain
that
thou
wouldst
in
part
hold
me
excused
but
although
thou
hast
none
i
who
have
one
child
can
not
therefore
escape
the
common
laws
to
which
other
mothers
are
subject
and
whose
enforcements
it
behoveth
me
ensue
need
must
i
against
my
will
and
contrary
to
all
right
and
seemliness
ask
of
thee
a
boon
which
i
know
is
supremely
dear
to
thee
and
that
with
good
reason
for
that
thy
sorry
fortune
hath
left
thee
none
other
delight
none
other
diversion
none
other
solace
to
wit
thy
falcon
whereof
my
boy
is
so
sore
enamoured
that
an
i
carry
it
not
to
him
i
fear
me
his
present
disorder
will
be
so
aggravated
that
there
may
presently
ensue
thereof
somewhat
whereby
i
shall
lose
him
wherefore
i
conjure
thee
not
by
the
love
thou
bearest
me
and
whereto
thou
art
nowise
beholden
but
by
thine
own
nobility
which
in
doing
courtesy
hath
approved
itself
greater
than
in
any
other
that
it
please
thee
give
it
to
me
so
by
the
gift
i
may
say
i
have
kept
my
son
alive
and
thus
made
him
for
ever
thy
debtor
federigo
hearing
what
the
lady
asked
and
knowing
that
he
could
not
oblige
her
for
that
he
had
given
her
the
falcon
to
eat
fell
in
her
presence
ere
he
could
answer
a
word
the
lady
at
first
believed
that
his
tears
arose
from
grief
at
having
to
part
from
his
good
falcon
and
was
like
to
say
that
she
would
not
have
it
however
she
contained
herself
and
awaited
what
federigo
should
reply
who
after
weeping
awhile
made
answer
thus
since
it
pleased
god
that
i
should
set
my
love
on
you
i
have
in
many
things
reputed
fortune
contrary
to
me
and
have
complained
of
her
but
all
the
ill
turns
she
hath
done
me
have
been
a
light
matter
in
comparison
with
that
which
she
doth
me
at
this
present
and
for
which
i
can
never
more
be
reconciled
to
her
considering
that
you
are
come
hither
to
my
poor
house
whereas
you
deigned
not
to
come
what
while
i
was
rich
and
seek
of
me
a
little
boon
the
which
she
hath
so
wrought
that
i
can
not
grant
you
and
why
this
can
not
be
i
will
tell
you
briefly
when
i
heard
that
you
of
your
favour
were
minded
to
dine
with
me
i
deemed
it
a
light
thing
and
a
seemly
having
regard
to
your
worth
and
the
nobility
of
your
station
to
honour
you
as
far
as
in
me
lay
with
some
choicer
victual
than
that
which
is
commonly
set
before
other
folk
wherefore
remembering
me
of
the
falcon
which
you
ask
of
me
and
of
his
excellence
i
judged
him
a
dish
worthy
of
you
this
very
morning
then
you
have
had
him
roasted
upon
the
trencher
and
indeed
i
had
accounted
him
excellently
well
bestowed
but
now
seeing
that
you
would
fain
have
had
him
on
other
wise
it
is
so
great
a
grief
to
me
that
i
can
not
oblige
you
therein
that
methinketh
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
therefor
so
saying
in
witness
of
this
he
let
cast
before
her
the
falcon
feathers
and
feet
and
beak
the
lady
seeing
and
hearing
this
first
blamed
him
for
having
to
give
a
woman
to
eat
slain
such
a
falcon
and
after
inwardly
much
commended
the
greatness
of
his
soul
which
poverty
had
not
availed
nor
might
anywise
avail
to
abate
then
being
put
out
of
all
hope
of
having
the
falcon
and
fallen
therefore
in
doubt
of
her
son
recovery
she
took
her
leave
and
returned
all
disconsolate
to
the
latter
who
before
many
days
had
passed
whether
for
chagrin
that
he
could
not
have
the
bird
or
for
that
his
disorder
was
fated
to
bring
him
to
that
pass
departed
this
life
to
the
inexpressible
grief
of
his
mother
after
she
had
abidden
awhile
full
of
tears
and
affliction
being
left
very
rich
and
yet
young
she
was
more
than
once
urged
by
her
brothers
to
marry
again
and
albeit
she
would
fain
not
have
done
so
yet
finding
herself
importuned
and
calling
to
mind
worth
and
his
last
magnificence
to
wit
the
having
slain
such
a
falcon
for
her
entertainment
she
said
to
them
would
gladly
an
it
liked
you
abide
as
i
am
but
since
it
is
your
pleasure
that
i
take
a
second
husband
certes
i
will
never
take
any
other
an
i
have
not
federigo
degli
alberighi
whereupon
her
brothers
making
mock
of
her
said
woman
that
thou
art
what
is
this
thou
sayest
how
canst
thou
choose
him
seeing
he
hath
nothing
in
the
world
mine
answered
she
know
very
well
that
it
is
as
you
say
but
i
would
liefer
have
a
man
that
lacketh
of
riches
than
riches
that
lack
of
a
man
her
brethren
hearing
her
mind
and
knowing
federigo
for
a
man
of
great
merit
poor
though
he
was
gave
her
with
all
her
wealth
to
him
even
as
she
would
and
he
seeing
himself
married
to
a
lady
of
such
worth
and
one
whom
he
had
loved
so
dear
and
exceeding
rich
to
boot
became
a
better
husband
of
his
substance
and
ended
his
days
with
her
in
joy
and
solace
the
tenth
story
day
the
fifth
pietro
di
vinciolo
goeth
to
sup
abroad
whereupon
his
wife
letteth
fetch
her
a
youth
to
keep
her
company
and
her
husband
returning
unlooked
for
she
hideth
her
gallant
under
a
pietro
telleth
her
how
there
had
been
found
in
the
house
of
one
arcolano
with
whom
he
was
to
have
supped
a
young
man
brought
in
by
his
wife
and
she
blameth
the
latter
presently
an
ass
by
mischance
setteth
foot
on
the
fingers
of
him
who
is
under
the
coop
and
he
roareth
out
whereupon
pietro
runneth
thither
and
espying
him
discovereth
his
wife
unfaith
but
ultimately
cometh
to
an
accord
with
her
for
his
own
lewd
ends
the
queen
story
come
to
an
end
and
all
having
praised
god
for
that
he
had
rewarded
federigo
according
to
his
desert
dioneo
who
never
waited
for
commandment
began
on
this
wise
i
know
not
whether
to
say
if
it
be
a
casual
vice
grown
up
in
mankind
through
perversity
of
manners
and
usances
or
a
defect
inherent
in
our
nature
that
we
laugh
rather
at
things
ill
than
at
good
works
especially
when
they
concern
us
not
wherefore
seeing
that
the
pains
i
have
otherwhiles
taken
and
am
now
about
to
take
aim
at
none
other
end
than
to
rid
you
of
melancholy
and
afford
you
occasion
for
laughter
and
merriment
albeit
the
matter
of
my
present
story
may
be
in
part
not
altogether
seemly
nevertheless
lovesome
lasses
for
that
it
may
afford
diversion
i
will
tell
it
you
and
do
you
hearkening
thereunto
as
you
are
wont
to
do
whenas
you
enter
into
gardens
where
putting
out
your
dainty
hands
you
cull
the
roses
and
leave
the
thorns
be
on
this
wise
must
you
do
with
my
story
leaving
the
naughty
man
of
whom
i
shall
tell
you
to
his
infamy
and
go
with
him
what
while
you
laugh
merrily
at
the
amorous
devices
of
his
wife
having
compassion
whenas
need
is
of
the
mischances
of
others
there
was
then
in
perugia
no
great
while
agone
a
rich
man
called
pietro
di
vinciolo
who
belike
more
to
beguile
others
and
to
abate
the
general
suspect
in
which
he
was
had
of
all
the
perugians
than
for
any
desire
of
his
own
took
him
a
wife
and
fortune
in
this
was
so
far
conformable
to
his
inclination
that
the
wife
he
took
was
a
thickset
wench
who
would
liefer
have
had
two
husbands
than
one
whereas
she
happened
upon
one
who
had
a
mind
far
more
disposed
to
otherwhat
than
to
her
becoming
in
process
of
time
aware
of
this
and
seeing
herself
fair
and
fresh
and
feeling
herself
buxom
and
lusty
she
began
by
being
sore
incensed
thereat
and
came
once
and
again
to
unseemly
words
thereof
with
her
husband
with
whom
she
was
well
nigh
always
at
variance
then
seeing
that
this
might
result
rather
in
her
own
exhaustion
than
in
the
amendment
of
her
husband
depravity
she
said
in
herself
caitiff
forsaketh
me
to
go
of
his
ribaldries
on
pattens
through
the
dry
and
i
will
study
to
carry
others
on
shipboard
through
the
wet
i
took
him
to
husband
and
brought
him
a
fine
great
dowry
knowing
him
to
be
a
man
and
supposing
him
desireful
of
that
whereunto
men
are
and
should
be
fain
and
had
i
not
believed
that
he
would
play
the
part
of
a
man
i
had
never
taken
him
he
knew
that
i
was
a
woman
why
then
did
he
take
me
to
wife
if
women
were
not
to
his
mind
this
is
not
to
be
suffered
were
i
minded
to
renounce
the
world
i
should
have
made
myself
a
nun
but
if
choosing
to
live
in
the
world
as
i
do
i
look
for
delight
or
pleasure
from
yonder
fellow
i
may
belike
grow
old
expecting
in
vain
and
whenas
i
shall
be
old
i
shall
in
vain
repent
and
bemoan
myself
of
having
wasted
my
youth
which
latter
he
himself
is
a
very
good
teacher
and
demonstrator
how
i
should
solace
showing
me
by
example
how
i
should
delect
myself
with
that
wherein
he
delighteth
more
by
token
that
this
were
commendable
in
me
whereas
in
him
it
is
exceeding
blameworthy
seeing
that
i
should
offend
against
the
laws
alone
whereas
he
offendeth
against
both
law
and
nature
accordingly
the
good
lady
having
thus
bethought
herself
and
belike
more
than
once
to
give
effect
privily
to
these
considerations
clapped
up
an
acquaintance
with
an
old
woman
who
showed
like
saint
verdiana
that
giveth
the
serpents
to
eat
and
still
went
to
every
pardoning
beads
in
hand
nor
ever
talked
of
aught
but
the
lives
of
the
holy
fathers
or
of
the
wounds
of
francis
and
was
of
well
nigh
all
reputed
a
saint
and
whenas
it
seemed
to
her
time
frankly
discovered
to
her
her
intent
mine
replied
the
beldam
who
knoweth
all
knoweth
that
thou
wilt
do
exceeding
well
and
if
for
nought
else
yet
shouldst
thou
do
it
thou
and
every
other
young
woman
not
to
lose
the
time
of
your
youth
for
that
to
whoso
hath
understanding
there
is
no
grief
like
that
of
having
lost
one
time
and
what
a
devil
are
we
women
good
for
once
we
are
old
save
to
keep
the
ashes
about
the
if
none
else
knoweth
it
and
can
bear
witness
thereof
that
do
and
can
i
for
now
that
i
am
old
i
recognize
without
avail
but
not
without
very
sore
and
bitter
remorse
of
mind
the
time
that
i
let
slip
and
albeit
i
lost
it
not
altogether
for
that
i
would
not
have
thee
deem
me
a
ninny
still
i
did
not
what
i
might
have
done
whereof
whenas
i
remember
me
seeing
myself
fashioned
as
thou
seest
me
at
this
present
so
that
thou
wouldst
find
none
to
give
me
fire
to
my
tinder
god
knoweth
what
chagrin
i
feel
with
men
it
is
not
so
they
are
born
apt
for
a
thousand
things
not
for
this
alone
and
most
part
of
them
are
of
much
more
account
old
than
young
but
women
are
born
into
the
world
for
nothing
but
to
do
this
and
bear
children
and
it
is
for
this
that
they
are
prized
the
which
if
from
nought
else
thou
mayst
apprehend
from
this
that
we
women
are
still
ready
for
the
sport
more
by
token
that
one
woman
would
tire
out
many
men
at
the
game
whereas
many
men
can
not
tire
one
woman
and
for
that
we
are
born
unto
this
i
tell
thee
again
that
thou
wilt
do
exceeding
well
to
return
thy
husband
a
loaf
for
his
bannock
so
thy
soul
may
have
no
cause
to
reproach
thy
flesh
in
thine
old
age
each
one
hath
of
this
world
just
so
much
as
he
taketh
to
himself
thereof
and
especially
is
this
the
case
with
women
whom
it
behoveth
much
more
than
men
make
use
of
their
time
whilst
they
have
it
for
thou
mayst
see
how
when
we
grow
old
nor
husband
nor
other
will
look
at
us
nay
they
send
us
off
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
tales
to
the
cat
and
count
the
pots
and
pans
and
what
is
worse
they
tag
rhymes
on
us
and
say
tidbits
for
wenches
young
gags
for
the
old
wife
tongue
footnote
she
was
grown
so
repulsively
ugly
in
her
old
age
that
no
one
cared
to
do
her
even
so
trifling
a
service
as
giving
her
a
spark
in
tinder
to
light
her
fire
withal
footnote
or
chokebits
and
many
another
thing
to
the
like
purpose
and
that
i
may
hold
thee
no
longer
in
parley
i
tell
thee
in
fine
that
thou
couldst
not
have
discovered
thy
mind
to
any
one
in
the
world
who
can
be
more
useful
to
thee
than
i
for
that
there
is
no
man
so
high
and
mighty
but
i
dare
tell
him
what
behoveth
nor
any
so
dour
or
churlish
but
i
know
how
to
supple
him
aright
and
bring
him
to
what
i
will
wherefore
do
thou
but
show
me
who
pleaseth
thee
and
after
leave
me
do
but
one
thing
i
commend
to
thee
daughter
mine
and
that
is
that
thou
be
mindful
of
me
for
that
i
am
a
poor
body
and
would
have
thee
henceforth
a
sharer
in
all
my
pardonings
and
in
all
the
paternosters
i
shall
say
so
god
may
make
them
light
and
candles
for
thy
dead
footnote
that
they
may
serve
to
purchase
remission
from
purgatory
for
the
souls
of
her
dead
relatives
instead
of
the
burning
of
candles
and
tapers
which
is
held
by
the
roman
catholic
church
to
have
that
effect
with
this
she
made
an
end
of
her
discourse
and
the
young
lady
came
to
an
understanding
with
her
that
whenas
she
chanced
to
spy
a
certain
young
spark
who
passed
often
through
that
quarter
and
whose
every
feature
she
set
out
to
her
she
should
know
what
she
had
to
do
then
giving
her
a
piece
of
salt
meat
she
dismissed
her
with
blessing
nor
had
many
days
passed
ere
the
old
woman
brought
her
him
of
whom
she
had
bespoken
her
privily
into
her
chamber
and
a
little
while
after
another
and
another
according
as
they
chanced
to
take
the
lady
fancy
who
stinted
not
to
indulge
herself
in
this
as
often
as
occasion
offered
though
still
fearful
of
her
husband
it
chanced
one
evening
that
her
husband
being
to
sup
abroad
with
a
friend
of
his
ercolano
by
name
she
charged
the
old
woman
bring
her
a
youth
who
was
one
of
the
goodliest
and
most
agreeable
of
all
perugia
which
she
promptly
did
but
hardly
had
the
lady
seated
herself
at
table
to
sup
with
her
gallant
when
behold
pietro
called
out
at
the
door
to
have
it
opened
to
him
she
hearing
this
gave
herself
up
for
lost
but
yet
desiring
an
she
might
to
conceal
the
youth
and
not
having
the
presence
of
mind
to
send
him
away
or
hide
him
elsewhere
made
him
take
refuge
under
a
that
was
in
a
shed
adjoining
the
chamber
where
they
were
at
supper
and
cast
over
him
the
sacking
of
a
that
she
had
that
day
let
empty
this
done
she
made
haste
to
open
to
her
husband
to
whom
quoth
she
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
house
have
very
soon
despatched
this
supper
of
yours
have
not
so
much
as
tasted
it
replied
he
and
she
said
was
that
quoth
he
will
tell
thee
scarce
were
we
seated
at
table
ercolano
and
his
wife
and
i
when
we
heard
some
one
sneeze
hard
by
whereof
we
took
no
note
the
first
time
nor
the
second
but
he
who
sneezed
sneezing
yet
a
third
time
and
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
and
many
other
times
it
made
us
all
marvel
whereupon
ercolano
who
was
somewhat
vexed
with
his
wife
for
that
she
had
kept
us
a
great
while
standing
at
the
door
without
opening
to
us
said
as
if
in
a
rage
what
meaneth
this
who
is
it
sneezeth
thus
and
rising
from
table
made
for
a
stair
that
stood
near
at
hand
and
under
which
hard
by
the
stairfoot
was
a
closure
of
planks
wherein
to
bestow
all
manner
things
as
we
see
those
do
every
day
who
set
their
houses
in
order
himseeming
it
was
from
this
that
came
the
noise
of
sneezing
he
opened
a
little
door
that
was
therein
and
no
sooner
had
he
done
this
than
there
issued
forth
thereof
the
frightfullest
stench
of
sulphur
that
might
be
somewhat
of
this
smell
had
already
reached
us
and
we
complaining
thereof
the
lady
had
said
it
is
because
i
was
but
now
in
act
to
bleach
my
veils
with
sulphur
and
after
set
the
pan
over
which
i
had
spread
them
to
catch
the
fumes
under
the
stair
so
that
it
yet
smoketh
thereof
as
soon
as
the
smoke
was
somewhat
spent
ercolano
looked
into
the
cupboard
and
there
espied
him
who
had
sneezed
and
who
was
yet
in
act
to
sneeze
for
that
the
fumes
of
the
sulphur
constrained
him
thereto
and
indeed
they
had
by
this
time
so
straitened
his
breast
that
had
he
abidden
a
while
longer
he
had
never
sneezed
nor
done
aught
else
again
ercolano
seeing
him
cried
out
now
wife
i
see
why
whenas
we
came
hither
awhile
ago
we
were
kept
so
long
at
the
door
without
its
being
opened
to
us
but
may
i
never
again
have
aught
that
shall
please
me
an
i
pay
thee
not
for
this
the
lady
hearing
this
and
seeing
that
her
sin
was
discovered
stayed
not
to
make
any
excuse
but
started
up
from
table
and
made
off
i
know
not
whither
ercolano
without
remarking
his
wife
flight
again
and
again
bade
him
who
sneezed
come
forth
but
the
latter
who
was
now
at
the
last
gasp
offered
not
to
stir
for
all
that
he
could
say
whereupon
taking
him
by
one
foot
he
haled
him
forth
of
his
and
ran
for
a
knife
to
kill
him
but
i
fearing
the
police
on
mine
own
account
arose
and
suffered
him
not
to
slay
him
or
do
him
any
hurt
nay
crying
out
and
defending
him
i
gave
the
alarm
to
certain
of
the
neighbours
who
ran
thither
and
taking
the
now
youth
carried
him
forth
the
house
i
know
not
whither
wherefore
our
supper
being
disturbed
by
these
things
i
have
not
only
not
despatched
it
nay
i
have
as
i
said
not
even
tasted
it
the
lady
hearing
this
knew
that
there
were
other
women
as
wise
as
herself
albeit
illhap
bytimes
betided
some
of
them
thereof
and
would
fain
have
defended
ercolano
wife
with
words
but
herseeming
that
by
blaming
others
defaults
she
might
make
freer
way
for
her
own
she
began
to
say
be
fine
doings
a
holy
and
virtuous
lady
indeed
she
must
be
she
to
whom
as
i
am
an
honest
woman
i
would
have
confessed
myself
so
spiritually
minded
meseemed
she
was
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
she
being
presently
an
old
woman
setteth
a
mighty
fine
example
to
the
young
accursed
by
the
hour
she
came
into
the
world
and
she
also
who
suffereth
herself
to
live
perfidious
and
vile
woman
that
she
must
be
the
general
reproach
and
shame
of
all
the
ladies
of
this
city
who
casting
to
the
winds
her
honour
and
the
faith
plighted
to
her
husband
and
the
world
esteem
is
not
ashamed
to
dishonour
him
and
herself
with
him
for
another
man
him
who
is
such
a
man
and
so
worshipful
a
citizen
and
who
used
her
so
well
so
god
save
me
there
should
be
no
mercy
had
of
such
women
as
she
they
should
be
put
to
death
they
should
be
cast
alive
into
the
fire
and
burned
to
ashes
then
bethinking
her
of
her
gallant
whom
she
had
hard
by
under
the
coop
she
began
to
exhort
pietro
to
betake
himself
to
bed
for
that
it
was
time
but
he
having
more
mind
to
eat
than
to
sleep
enquired
if
there
was
aught
for
supper
quotha
answered
the
lady
we
are
much
used
to
get
supper
whenas
thou
art
abroad
a
fine
thing
indeed
dost
thou
take
me
for
wife
alack
why
dost
thou
not
go
to
sleep
for
how
far
better
thou
wilt
do
now
it
chanced
that
certain
husbandmen
of
pietro
being
come
that
evening
with
sundry
matters
from
the
farm
and
having
put
up
their
asses
without
watering
them
in
a
little
stable
adjoining
the
shed
one
of
the
latter
being
sore
athirst
slipped
his
head
out
of
the
halter
and
making
his
way
out
of
the
stable
went
smelling
to
everything
so
haply
he
might
find
some
water
and
going
thus
he
came
presently
full
on
the
under
which
was
the
young
man
the
latter
having
for
that
it
behoved
him
abide
on
all
fours
put
out
the
fingers
of
one
hand
on
the
ground
beyond
the
coop
such
was
his
luck
or
rather
let
us
say
his
ill
luck
that
the
ass
set
his
hoof
on
them
whereupon
the
youth
feeling
an
exceeding
great
pain
set
up
a
terrible
outcry
pietro
hearing
this
marvelled
and
perceived
that
the
noise
came
from
within
the
house
wherefore
he
went
out
into
the
shed
and
hearing
the
other
still
clamouring
for
that
the
ass
had
not
lifted
up
his
hoof
from
his
fingers
but
still
trod
hard
upon
them
said
is
there
then
running
to
the
he
raised
it
and
espied
the
young
man
who
beside
the
pain
he
suffered
from
his
fingers
that
were
crushed
by
the
ass
hoof
was
all
for
fear
lest
pietro
should
do
him
a
mischief
the
latter
knowing
him
for
one
whom
he
had
long
pursued
for
his
lewd
ends
asked
him
what
he
did
there
whereto
he
answered
him
nothing
but
prayed
him
for
the
love
of
god
do
him
no
harm
quoth
pietro
and
fear
not
that
i
will
do
thee
any
hurt
but
tell
me
how
thou
comest
here
and
for
what
purpose
the
youth
told
him
all
whereupon
pietro
no
less
rejoiced
to
have
found
him
than
his
wife
was
woeful
taking
him
by
the
hand
carried
him
into
the
chamber
where
the
lady
awaited
him
with
the
greatest
affright
in
the
world
and
seating
himself
overagainst
her
said
now
thou
cursedst
ercolano
wife
and
avouchedst
that
she
should
be
burnt
and
that
she
was
the
disgrace
of
all
you
women
why
didst
thou
not
speak
of
thyself
or
an
thou
choosedst
not
to
speak
of
thyself
how
could
thy
conscience
suffer
thee
to
speak
thus
of
her
knowing
thyself
to
have
done
even
as
did
she
certes
none
other
thing
moved
thee
thereunto
save
that
you
women
are
all
made
thus
and
look
to
cover
your
own
doings
with
defaults
would
fire
might
come
from
heaven
to
burn
you
all
up
perverse
generation
that
you
are
the
lady
seeing
that
in
the
first
heat
of
the
discovery
he
had
done
her
no
harm
other
than
in
words
and
herseeming
she
saw
that
he
was
all
agog
with
joy
for
that
he
held
so
goodly
a
stripling
by
the
hand
took
heart
and
said
this

i
am

may
sup
and
after
i

order
this

on
such

thou
shalt
have
no

caitiff

a
husband
and
the
young
man
after
supper
what
pietro
devised
for
the
satisfaction
of
all
three
hath
escaped
my
mind
but
this
much
i
know
that
on
the
following
morning
the
youth
was
escorted
back
to
the
public
place
not
altogether
certain
which
he
had
the
more
been
that
night
wife
or
husband
wherefore
dear
my
ladies
this
will
i
say
to
you
doth
it
to
you
do
you
it
to
him
and
if
you
can
not
presently
keep
it
in
mind
till
such
time
as
you
can
so
he
may
get
as
good
as
he
giveth
dioneo
having
made
an
end
of
his
story
which
had
been
less
laughed
at
by
the
ladies

usual

shamefastness

for
the
little
delight
they
took

introduction
to
the
last
story
of
the
first
day
as
many
of
you
ladies
may
either
know
by
sight
or
have
heard
tell
there
was
not
long
since
in
our
city
a
noble
and
and
gentlewoman
whose
worth
merited
not
that
her
name
be
left
unsaid
she
was
called
then
madam
oretta
and
was
the
wife
of
messer
geri
spina
she
chanced
to
be
as
we
are
in
the
country
going
from
place
to
place
by
way
of
diversion
with
a
company
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
whom
she
had
that
day
entertained
to
dinner
at
her
house
and
the
way
being
belike
somewhat
long
from
the
place
whence
they
set
out
to
that
whither
they
were
all
purposed
to
go
afoot

carry
you
great

way
we
have
to
go
with
one
of
the
finest
stories
in
the
world
sir
answered
the
lady
pray
you
instantly
thereof
indeed
it
will
be
most
agreeable
to
me
master
cavalier
who
maybe
fared
no
better
sword
at
side
than
tale
on
tongue
hearing
this
began
a
story
of
his
which
of
itself
was
in
truth
very
goodly
but
he
now
thrice
or
four
or
even
half
a
dozen
times
repeating
one
same
word
anon
turning
back
and
whiles
saying
said
not
aright
and
often
erring
in
the
names
and
putting
one
for
another
marred
it
cruelly
more
by
token
that
he
delivered
himself
exceedingly
ill
having
regard
to
the
quality
of
the
persons
and
the
nature
of
the
incidents
of
his
tale
by
reason
whereof
madam
oretta
hearkening
to
him
was
many
a
time
taken
with
a
sweat
and
failing
of
the
heart
as
she
were
sick
and
near
her
end
and
at
last
being
unable
to
brook
the
thing
any
more
and
seeing
the
gentleman
engaged
in
an
imbroglio
from
which
he
was
not
like
to
extricate
himself
she
said
to
him
pleasantly
this
horse
of
yours
hath
too
hard
a
trot
wherefore
i
pray
you
be
pleased
to
set
me
down
the
gentleman
who
as
it
chanced
understood
a
hint
better
than
he
told
a
story
took
the
jest
in
good
part
and
turning
it
off
with
a
laugh
fell
to
discoursing
of
other
matters
and
left
unfinished
the
story
that
he
had
begun
and
conducted

the

with
a
word
of
his

maketh
messer
geri
spina
sensible
of
an
indiscreet
request
of
his
madam
oretta
saying
was
greatly
commended
of
all
ladies
and
men
and
the
queen
bidding
pampinea
follow
on
she
began
thus
fair
ladies
i
know
not
of
mine
own
motion
to
resolve
me
which
is
the
more
at
fault
whether
nature
in
fitting
to
a
noble
soul
a
mean
body
or
fortune
in
imposing
a
mean
condition
upon
a
body
endowed
with
a
noble
soul
as
in
one
our
townsman
cisti
and
in
many
another
we
may
have
seen
it
happen
which
cisti
being
gifted
with
a
very
lofty
spirit
fortune
made
him
a
baker
and
for
this
certes
i
should
curse
both
nature
and
fortune
like
did
i
not
know
the
one
to
be
most
discreet
and
the
other
to
have
a
thousand
eyes
albeit
fools
picture
her
blind
and
i
imagine
therefore
that
being
exceeding
they
do
that
which
is
oftentimes
done
of
human
beings
who
uncertain
of
future
events
bury
their
most
precious
things
against
their
occasions
in
the
meanest
places
of
their
houses
as
being
the
least
suspect
and
thence
bring
them
forth
in
their
greatest
needs
the
mean
place
having
the
while
kept
them
more
surely
than
would
the
goodly
chamber
and
so
meseemeth
do
the
governors
of
the
world
hide
oftentimes
their
most
precious
things
under
the
shadow
of
crafts
and
conditions
reputed
most
mean
to
the
end
that
bringing
them
forth
therefrom
in
time
of
need
their
lustre
may
show
the
brighter
which
how
cisti
the
baker
made
manifest
though
in
but
a
trifling
matter
restoring
to
messer
geri
spina
whom
the
story
but
now
told
of
madam
oretta
who
was
his
wife
hath
recalled
to
my
memory
the
eyes
of
the
understanding
it
pleaseth
me
to
show
you
in
a
very
short
story
i
must
tell
you
then
that
pope
boniface
with
whom
messer
geri
spina
was
in
very
great
favour
having
despatched
to
florence
certain
of
his
gentlemen
on
an
embassy
concerning
sundry
important
matters
of
his
they
lighted
down
at
the
house
of
messer
geri
and
he
treating
the
pope
affairs
in
company
with
them
it
chanced
whatever
might
have
been
the
occasion
thereof
that
he
and
they
passed
well
nigh
every
morning
afoot
before
santa
maria
ughi
where
cisti
the
baker
had
his
bakehouse
and
plied
his
craft
in
person
now
albeit
fortune
had
appointed
cisti
a
humble
enough
condition
she
had
so
far
at
the
least
been
kind
to
him
therein
that
he
was
grown
very
rich
and
without
ever
choosing
to
abandon
it
for
any
other
lived
very
splendidly
having
amongst
his
other
good
things
the
best
wines
white
and
red
that
were
to
be
found
in
florence
or
in
the
neighbouring
country
seeing
messer
geri
and
the
pope
ambassadors
pass
every
morning
before
his
door
and
the
heat
being
great
he
bethought
himself
that
it
were
a
great
courtesy
to
give
them
to
drink
of
his
good
white
wine
but
having
regard
to
his
own
condition
and
that
of
messer
geri
he
deemed
it
not
a
seemly
thing
to
presume
to
invite
them
but
determined
to
bear
himself
on
such
wise
as
should
lead
messer
geri
to
invite
himself
accordingly
having
still
on
his
body
a
very
white
doublet
and
an
apron
fresh
from
the
wash
which
bespoke
him
rather
a
miller
than
a
baker
he
let
set
before
his
door
every
morning
towards
the
time
when
he
looked
for
messer
geri
and
the
ambassadors
to
pass
a
new
tinned
pail
of
fair
water
and
a
small
pitcher
of
new
bolognese
ware
full
of
his
good
white
wine
together
with
two
beakers
which
seemed
of
silver
so
bright
they
were
and
seated
himself
there
against
they
should
pass
when
after
clearing
his
throat
once
or
twice
he
fell
to
drinking
of
that
his
wine
with
such
a
relish
that
he
had
made
a
dead
man
mouth
water
for
it
messer
geri
having
seen
him
do
thus
one
and
two
mornings
said
on
the
third
now
cisti
is
it
good
whereupon
he
started
to
his
feet
and
said
is
it
sir
but
how
good
i
can
not
give
you
to
understand
except
you
taste
thereof
messer
geri
in
whom
either
the
nature
of
the
weather
or
belike
the
relish
with
which
he
saw
cisti
drink
had
begotten
a
thirst
turned
to
the
ambassadors
and
said
smiling
we
shall
do
well
to
taste
this
honest
man
wine
belike
it
is
such
that
we
shall
not
repent
thereof
accordingly
he
made
with
them
towards
cisti
who
let
bring
a
goodly
settle
out
of
his
bakehouse
and
praying
them
sit
said
to
their
who
pressed
forward
to
rinse
the
beakers
back
friends
and
leave
this
office
to
me
for
that
i
know
no
less
well
how
to
skink
than
to
wield
the
and
look
you
not
to
taste
a
drop
thereof
so
saying
he
with
his
own
hands
washed
out
four
new
and
goodly
beakers
and
letting
bring
a
little
pitcher
of
his
good
wine
busied
himself
with
giving
messer
geri
and
his
companions
to
drink
to
whom
the
wine
seemed
the
best
they
had
drunken
that
great
while
wherefore
they
commended
it
greatly
and
well
nigh
every
morning
whilst
the
ambassadors
abode
there
messer
geri
went
thither
to
drink
in
company
with
them
after
awhile
their
business
being
despatched
and
they
about
to
depart
messer
geri
made
them
a
magnificent
banquet
whereto
he
bade
a
number
of
the
most
worshipful
citizens
and
amongst
the
rest
cisti
who
would
however
on
no
condition
go
thither
whereupon
messer
geri
bade
one
of
his
go
fetch
a
flask
of
the
baker
wine
and
give
each
guest
a
half
beaker
thereof
with
the
first
course
the
servant
despiteful
most
like
for
that
he
had
never
availed
to
drink
of
the
wine
took
a
great
flagon
which
when
cisti
saw
son
said
he
geri
sent
thee
not
to
me
the
man
avouched
again
and
again
that
he
had
but
getting
none
other
answer
returned
to
messer
geri
and
reported
it
to
him
quoth
he
back
to
him
and
tell
him
that
i
do
indeed
send
thee
to
him
and
if
he
still
make
thee
the
same
answer
ask
him
to
whom
i
send
thee
an
it
be
not
to
him
accordingly
the
servant
went
back
to
the
baker
and
said
to
him
for
certain
messer
geri
sendeth
me
to
thee
and
none
other
certain
my
son
answered
the
baker
doth
it
not
said
the
man
whom
doth
he
send
me
the
arno
replied
cisti
which
answer
when
the
servant
reported
to
messer
geri
the
eyes
of
his
understanding
were
of
a
sudden
opened
and
he
said
to
the
man
me
see
what
flask
thou
carriedst
thither
when
he
saw
the
great
flagon
aforesaid
he
said
saith
sooth
and
giving
the
man
a
sharp
reproof
made
him
take
a
sortable
flask
which
when
cisti
saw
quoth
he
know
full
well
that
he
sendeth
thee
to
me
and
cheerfully
filled
it
unto
him
then
that
same
day
he
let
fill
a
little
cask
with
the
like
wine
and
causing
carry
it
softly
to
messer
geri

went
presently
thither
and
finding
him
there
said

remind

over

that
which
hath

that
the
nature
of

is
such
that
they
should
bite
upon

as

as
the
sheep
biteth
for
that
an
a

bit
like

it
were
not
a
trait
but
an
affront
the
right
mean
in
this
was
excellently
well
hit
both
by

speech

cisti
reply
it
is
true
that
if
a

thing
be
said
by
way
of

biteth
like
a
dog
having

bitten

he
is
not

be
blamed
as
he
would
have
been
had
this
not
been
the
case
wherefore
it
behoveth
us
look
how
and
with
whom
no
less
than
when
and
where
we
bandy
jests
to
which
considerations
a
prelate
of
ours
taking
too
little
heed
received
at
least
as
sharp
a
bite
as
he
thought
to
give
as
i
shall
show
you
in
a
little
story
messer
antonio
a
learned
and
worthy
prelate
being
bishop
of
florence
there
came
thither
a
catalan
gentleman
called
messer
dego
della
ratta
marshal
for
king
robert
who
being
a
man
of
a
very
fine
person
and
a
great
amorist
took
a
liking
to
one
among
other
florentine
ladies
a
very
fair
lady
and
granddaughter
to
a
brother
of
the
said
bishop
and
hearing
that
her
husband
albeit
a
man
of
good
family
was
very
sordid
and
miserly
agreed
with
him
to
give
him
five
hundred
gold
florins
so
he
would
suffer
him
lie
a
night
with
his
wife
accordingly
he
let
gild
so
many
silver
poplins
a
coin
which
was
then
current
and
having
lain
with
the
lady
though
against
her
will
gave
them
to
the
husband
the
thing
after
coming
to
be
known
everywhere
the
sordid
wretch
of
a
husband
reaped
both
loss
and
scorn
but
the
bishop
like
a
discreet
man
as
he
was
affected
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
wherefore
he
and
the
marshal
consorting
much
together
it
chanced
as
they
rode
side
by
side
with
each
other
one
john
day
viewing
the
ladies
on
either
side
of
the
way
where
the
mantle
is
run
for
the
prelate
espied
a
young
lady
of
whom
this
present
pestilence
hath
bereft
us
and
whom
all
you
ladies
must
have
known
madam
nonna
de
pulci
by
name
cousin
to
messer
alessio
rinucci
a
fresh
and
fair
young
woman
both
and
then
not
long
before
married
in
porta
san
piero
and
pointed
her
out
to
the
marshal
then
being
near
her
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
latter
shoulder
and
said
to
her
how
deemest
thou
of
this
gallant
thinkest
thou
thou
couldst
make
a
conquest
of
him
it
seemed
to
the
lady
that
those
words
somewhat
trenched
upon
her
honour
and
were
like
to
sully
it
in
the
eyes
of

hath
still

hath
ever
letting

having
one
day
with
a
falcon
of
his
brought
down
a
crane
and
finding
it
young
and
fat
he
sent
it
to
a
good
cook
he
had
a
venetian
hight
chichibio
bidding
him
roast
it
for
supper
and
dress
it
well
chichibio
who
looked
the
gull
he
was
trussed
the
crane
and
setting
it
to
the
fire
proceeded
to
cook
it
diligently
when
it
was
all
but
done
and
gave
out
a
very
savoury
smell
it
chanced
that
a
wench
of
the
neighbourhood
brunetta
by
name
of
whom
chichibio
was
sore
enamoured
entered
the
kitchen
and
smelling
the
crane
and
seeing
it
instantly
besought
him
to
give
her
a
thigh
thereof
he
answered
her
singing
and
said
shalt
not
have
it
from
me
mistress
brunetta
thou
shalt
not
have
it
from
me
whereat
she
being
vexed
said

an
thou
give
it
me
not
thou
shalt
never
have
of
me
aught
that
shall
pleasure
thee
in
brief
many
were
the
words
between
them
and
at
last
chichibio
not
to
anger
his
mistress
cut
off
one
of
the
thighs
of
the
crane
and
gave
it
her
the
bird
being
after
set
before
messer
currado
and
certain
stranger
guests
of
his
lacking
a
thigh
and
the
former
marvelling
thereat
he
let
call
chichibio
and
asked
him
what
was
come
of
the
other
thigh
whereto
the
liar
of
a
venetian
answered
without
hesitation
cranes
have
but
one
thigh
and
one
leg
a
devil
cried
currado
in
a
rage
have
but
one
thigh
and
one
leg
have
i
never
seen
a
crane
before
replied
chichibio
is
as
i
tell
you
and
whenas
it
pleaseth
you
i
will
cause
you
see
it
in
the
quick
currado
out
of
regard
for
the
strangers
he
had
with
him
chose
not
to
make
more
words
of
the
matter
but
said
thou
sayst
thou
wilt
cause
me
see
it
in
the
quick
a
thing
i
never
yet
saw
or
heard
tell
of
i
desire
to
see
it
morning
in
which
case
i
shall
be
content
but
i
swear
to
thee
by
christ
his
body
that
an
it
be
otherwise
i
will
have
thee
served
on
such
wise
that
thou
shalt
still
have

to
remember
my
name
to
thy
sorrow
so
long
as
thou
livest
there
was
an
end
of
the
talk
for
that
night
but
next
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
day
currado
whose
anger
was
nothing
abated
for
sleep
arose
still
full
of
wrath
and
bade
bring
the
horses
then
mounting
chichibio
upon
a
rouncey
he
carried
him
off
towards
a
watercourse
on
whose
banks
cranes
were
still
to
be
seen
at
break
of
day
saying
shall
soon
see
who
lied
yestereve
thou
or
i
chichibio
seeing
that
his
master
wrath
yet
endured
and
that
needs
must
be
made
good
his
lie
and
knowing
not
how
he
should
avail
thereunto
rode
after
currado
in
the
greatest
fright
that
might
be
and
fain
would
he
have
fled
so
but
he
might
but
seeing
no
way
of
escape
he
looked
now
before
him
and
now
behind
and
now
on
either
side
and
took
all
he
saw
for
cranes
standing
on
two
feet
presently
coming
near
to
the
river
he
chanced
to
catch
sight
before
any
other
of
a
round
dozen
of
cranes
on
the
bank
all
perched
on
one
leg
as
they
use
to
do
when
they
sleep
whereupon
he
straightway
showed
them
to
currado
saying
sir
if
you
look
at
those
that
stand
yonder
you
may
very
well
see
that
i
told
you
the
truth
yesternight
to
wit
that
cranes
have
but
one
thigh
and
one
leg
currado
seeing
them
answered
and
i
will
show
thee
that
they
have
two
and
going
somewhat
nearer
to
them
he
cried
out
ho
at
this
the
cranes
putting
down
the
other
leg
all
after
some
steps
took
to
flight
whereupon
currado
said
to
him
sayst
thou
now
malapert
knave
that
thou
art
deemest
thou
they
have
two
legs
chichibio
all
confounded
and
knowing
not
whether
he
stood
on
his
head
or
his
heels
answered
sir
but
you
did
not
cry
ho
ho
to
yesternight
crane
had
you
cried
thus
it
would
have
put
out
the
other
thigh
and
the
other
leg
even
as
did
those
yonder
this
reply
so
tickled
currado
that
all
his
wrath
was
changed
into
mirth
and
laughter
and
he
said
thou
art
in
the
right
indeed
i
should
have
done
it
thus
then
with
his
prompt
and
comical
answer
did
chichibio
avert
ill
luck
and
made
his
peace
with
his
master

under

are
marvellous
wits
found
to
have
been
lodged
by
nature
and
this
very
plainly
appeared
in
two
townsmen
of
ours
of
whom
i
purpose
briefly
to
entertain
you
for
that
the
one
who
was
called
messer
forese
da
rabatta
though
little
of
person
and
misshapen
with
a
flat
camoys
face
that
had
been
an
eyesore
on
the
shoulders
of
the
foulest
cadger
in
florence
was
yet
of
such
excellence
in
the
interpretation
of
the
laws
that
he
was
of
many
men
of
worth
reputed
a
very
treasury
of
civil
right
whilst
the
other
whose
name
was
giotto
had
so
excellent
a
genius
that
there
was
nothing
of
all
which
nature
mother
and
mover
of
all
things
presenteth
unto
us
by
the
ceaseless
revolution
of
the
heavens
but
he
with
pencil
and
pen
and
brush
depicted
it
and
that
so
closely
that
not
like
nay
but
rather
the
thing
itself
it
seemed
insomuch
that
visual
sense
is
found
to
have
been
oftentimes
deceived
in
things
of
his
fashion
taking
that
for
real
which
was
but
depictured
wherefore
he
having
brought
back
to
the
light
this
art
which
had
for
many
an
age
lain
buried
under
the
errors
of
certain
folk
who
painted
more
to
divert
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant
than
to
please
the
understanding
of
the
judicious
he
may
deservedly
be
styled
one
of
the
chief
glories
of
florence
the
more
so
that
he
bore
the
honours
he
had
gained
with
the
utmost
humility
and
although
while
he
lived
chief
over
all
else
in
his
art
he
still
refused
to
be
called
master
which
title
though
rejected
by
him
shone
so
much
the
more
gloriously
in
him
as
it
was
with
greater
eagerness
greedily
usurped
by
those
who
knew
less
than
he
or
by
his
disciples
yet
great
as
was
his
skill
he
was
not
therefore
anywise
goodlier
of
person
or
better
favoured
than
messer
forese
but
to
come
to
my
story
i
must
tell
you
that
messer
forese
and
giotto
had
each
his
country
house
at
mugello
and
the
former
having
gone
to
visit
his
estates
at
that
season
of
the
summer
when
the
courts
hold
holiday
and
returning
thence
on
a
sorry
chanced
to
fall
in
with
the
aforesaid
giotto
who
had
been
on
the
same
errand
and
was
then
on
his
way
back
to
florence
nowise
better
equipped
than
himself
in
horse
and
accoutrements
accordingly
they
joined
company
and
fared
on
softly
like
old
men
as
they
were
presently
it
chanced
as
we
often
see
it
happen
in
summer
time
that
a
sudden
shower
overtook
them
from
which
as
quickliest
they
might
they
took
shelter
in
the
house
of
a
husbandman
a
friend
and
acquaintance
of
both
of
them
after
awhile
the
rain
showing
no
sign
of
giving
over
and
they
wishing
to
reach
florence
by
daylight
they
borrowed
of
their
host
two
old
homespun
cloaks
and
two
hats
rusty
with
age
for
that
there
were
no
better
to
be
had
and
set
out
again
upon
their
way
when
they
had
gone
awhile
and
were
all
drenched
and
bemired
with
the
splashing
that
their
hackneys
kept
up
with
their
hoofs
things
which
use
not
to
add
worship
to
any
one
looks
the
weather
began
to
clear
a
little

the
two
wayfarers
who
had
long
fared
on
in
silence
fell
to
conversing
together
messer

he
rode
hearkening
to
giotto

was
a
very
fine
talker
fell
to
considering
his
companion
from
head
to
foot
and
seeing
him
everywise
so
ill
accoutred
and
in
such
scurvy
case
burst
out
laughing
and
without
taking
any
thought
to
his
own
plight
said
to
him

there

a
stranger

thee

thee
to

as
thou
art
the
finest
painter
in

might
believe
it

looking
upon
you
he
should
believe
that
you

a
b
messer

this
was

sold

a
story
wherein
without
deviating
from

appointed
theme
it
is
demonstrated
how
great
is
their
nobility
and
it
pleaseth
me
therefore
to
relate
it
it
is
no
great
while
since
there
was
in
our
city
a
young
man
called
michele
scalza
who
was
the
merriest
and
most
agreeable
man
in
the
world
and
he
had
still
the
rarest
stories
in
hand
wherefore
the
young
florentines
were
exceeding
glad
to
have
his
company
whenas
they
made
a
party
of
pleasure
amongst
themselves
it
chanced
one
day
he
being
with
certain
folk
at
monte
ughi
that
the
question
was
started
among
them
of
who
were
the
best
and
oldest
gentlemen
of
florence
some
said
the
uberti
others
the
lamberti
and
one
this
family
and
another
that
according
as
it
occurred
to
his
mind
which
scalza
hearing
he
fell
and
said
to
addlepates
that
you
are
you
know
not
what
you
say
the
best
gentlemen
and
the
oldest
not
only
of
florence
but
of
all
the
world
or
the
maremma
are
the
cadgers
a
matter
upon
which
all
the
phisopholers
and
every
one
who
knoweth
them
as
i
do
are
of
accord
and
lest
you
should
understand
it

i
speak

to

in
the
days
when

the

to

and
to
assure
yourselves
that
in
this
i

sooth
do

consider
the
cadgers
in
comparison
with
other
folk
whereas
you
see
all
the
rest
of
mankind
with
faces
well
composed
and
duly
proportioned
you
may
see
the
cadgers
this
with
a
visnomy
very
long
and
strait
and
with
a
face
out
of

short

a
third
hath
a
chin
jutting
out
and
turned
upward
and
huge
jawbones
that
show
as
they
were
those
of
an

whilst
some
there
be
who
have

some

the

that
children
used
to
make
whenas
they
first
begin
to
learn
to
draw
wherefore
as
i
have
already
said
it
is
abundantly
apparent
that
god
the
lord
made
them
what
time
he
was
learning
to

so
that
they
are
more
ancient

consequently
nobler

had
wagered

all

hearing
scalza
comical
argument
and
remembering
themselves
fell
all
and
affirmed
that
he
was
in
the
right
and
had
won

for
that
the

were
assuredly
the
noblest
and
most
ancient
gentlemen
that
were
to
be
found
not
in
florence
alone
but
in
the
world
or
the
maremma
wherefore
it
was
very
justly
said
of
pamfilo
seeking
to
show
the
foulness
of
messer

that
it
would
have
showed
notably
ugly

of

of
the
comical

of

by
her
husband
with
a
lover
of
hers
and
brought
to

with

prompt
and
pleasant

and
causeth

statute

was
now
silent
and
all
laughed
yet
at
the
novel
argument
used
by
scalza
for
the
ennoblement
over
all
of
the
cadgers
when
the
queen
enjoined
filostrato
to
tell
and
he
accordingly
began
to
say
it
is
everywise
a
fine
thing
noble
ladies
to
know
how
to
speak
well
but
i
hold
it
yet
goodlier
to
know
how
to
do
it
whereas
necessity
requireth
it
even
as
a
gentlewoman
of
whom
i
purpose
to
entertain
you
knew
well
how
to
do
on
such
wise
that
not
only
did
she
afford
her
hearers
matter
for
mirth
and
laughter
but
did
herself
loose
from
the
toils
of
an
ignominious
death
as
you
shall
presently
hear
there
was
then
aforetime
in
the
city
of
prato
a
statute
in
truth
no
less
blameworthy
than
cruel
which
without
making
any
distinction
ordained
that
any
woman
found
by
her
husband
in
adultery
with
any
her
lover
should
be
burnt
even
as
she
who
should
be
discovered
to
have
sold
her
favours
for
money
what
while
this
statute
was
in
force
it
befell
that
a
noble
and
beautiful
lady
by
name
madam
filippa
who
was
of
a
singularly
amorous
complexion
was
one
night
found
by
rinaldo
pugliesi
her
husband
in
her
own
chamber
in
the
arms
of
lazzerino
guazzagliotri
a
noble
and
handsome
youth
of
that
city
whom
she
loved
even
as
herself
rinaldo
seeing
this
was
sore
enraged
and
scarce
contained
himself
from
falling
upon
them
and
slaying
them
and
but
that
he
feared
for
himself
an
he
should
ensue
the
promptings
of
his
anger
he
had
certainly
done
it
however
he
forbore
from
this
but
could
not
refrain
from
seeking
of
the
law
of
prato
that
which
it
was
not
permitted
him
to
accomplish
with
his
own
hand
to
wit
the
death
of
his
wife
having
therefore
very
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
the
lady
default
no
sooner
was
the
day
come
than
without
taking
other
counsel
he
lodged
an
accusation
against
her
and
caused
summon
her
before
the
provost
madam
filippa
being
great
of
heart
as
women
commonly
are
who
are
verily
in
love
resolved
although
counselled
to
the
contrary
by
many
of
her
friends
and
kinsfolk
to
appear
choosing
rather
confessing
the
truth
to
die
with
an
undaunted
spirit
than
meanly
fleeing
to
live
an
outlaw
in
exile
and
confess
herself
unworthy
of
such
a
lover
as
he
in
whose
arms
she
had
been
the
foregoing
night
wherefore
presenting
herself
before
the
provost
attended
by
a
great
company
of
men
and
ladies
and
exhorted
of
all
to
deny
the
charge
she
demanded
with
a
firm
voice
and
an
assured
air
what
he
would
with
her
the
magistrate
looking
upon
her
and
seeing
her
very
fair
and
commendable
of
carriage
and
according
as
her
words
testified
of
a
lofty
spirit
began
to
have
compassion
of
her
fearing
lest
she
should
confess
somewhat
wherefore
it
should
behoove
him
for
his
own
honour
sake
condemn
her
to
die
however
having
no
choice
but
to
question
her
of
that
which
was
laid
to
her
charge
he
said
to
her
as
you
see
here
is
rinaldo
your
husband
who
complaineth
of
you
avouching
himself
to
have
found
you
in
adultery
with
another
man
and
demanding
that
i
should
punish
you
therefor
by
putting
you
to
death
according
to
the
tenor
of
a
statute
which
here
obtaineth
but
this
i
can
not
do
except
you
confess
it
wherefore
look
well
what
you
answer
and
tell
me
if
that
be
true
whereof
your
husband
impeacheth
you
the
lady
no
wise
dismayed
replied
very
cheerfully
true
it
is
that
rinaldo
is
my
husband
and
that
he
found
me
last
night
in
the
arms
of
lazzarino
wherein
for
the
great
and
perfect
love
i
bear
him
i
have
many
a
time
been
nor
am
i
anywise
minded
to
deny
this
but
as
i
am
assured
you
know
laws
should
be
common
to
all
and
made
with
the
consent
of
those
whom
they
concern
and
this
is
not
the
case
with
this
statute
which
is
binding
only
upon
us
unhappy
women
who
might
far
better
than
men
avail
to
satisfy
many
more
by
token
that
when
it
was
made
not
only
did
no
woman
yield
consent
thereunto
but
none
of
us
was
even
cited
to
do
so
wherefore
it
may
justly
be
styled
naught
however
an
you
choose
to
the
prejudice
of
my
body
and
of
your
own
soul
to
be
the
executor
of
this
unrighteous
law
it
resteth
with
you
to
do
so
but
ere
you
proceed
to
adjudge
aught
i
pray
you
do
me
one
slight
favour
to
wit
that
you
question
my
husband
if
at
all
times
and
as
often
as
it
pleased
him
without
ever
saying
him
nay
i
have
or
not
vouchsafed
him
entire
commodity
of
myself
rinaldo
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
of
the
provost
straightway
made
answer
that
undoubtedly
the
lady
had
at
his
every
request
accorded
him
his
every
pleasure
of
herself
whereupon
my
lord
provost
straightway
rejoined
she
he
have
still
taken
of
me
that
which
was
needful
and
pleasing
to
him
what
i
ask
you
was
or
am
i
to
do
with
that
which
remaineth
over
and
above
his
requirements
should
i
cast
it
to
the
dogs
was
it
not
far
better
to
gratify
withal
a
gentleman
who
loveth
me
more
than
himself
than
to
leave
it
waste
or
spoil
now
well
nigh
all
the
people
of
prato
had
flocked
thither
to
the
trial
of
such
a
matter
and
of
so
fair
and
famous
a
lady
and
hearing
so
comical
a
question
they
all
after
much
laughter
cried
out
as
with
one
voice
that
she
was
in
the
right
of
it
and
that
she
said
well
moreover
ere
they
departed
thence
at
the
instance
of
the
provost
they
modified
the
cruel
statute
and
left
it
to
apply
to
those
women
only
who
should
for
money
make
default
to
their
husbands
thereupon
rinaldo
having
taken
nought
but
shame
by
so
fond
an
emprise
departed
the
court
and
the
lady
returned
in
triumph
to
her
own
house
joyful
and
free
and
in
a
manner
raised
up
out
of
the
fire
the
eighth
story
day
the
sixth
fresco
exhorteth
his
niece
not
to
mirror
herself
in
the
glass
if
as
she
saith
it
irketh
her
to
see
disagreeable
folk
the
story
told
by
filostrato
at
first
touched
the
hearts
of
the
listening
ladies
with
some
little
shamefastness
and
they
gave
token
thereof
by
a
modest
redness
that
appeared
upon
their
faces
but
after
looking
one
at
another
they
hearkened
thereto
tittering
the
while
and
scarce
able
to
abstain
from
laughing
as
soon
as
he
was
come
to
the
end
thereof
the
queen
turned
to
emilia
and
bade
her
follow
on
whereupon
sighing
no
otherwise
than
as
she
had
been
aroused
from
a
dream
she
began
lovesome
lasses
for
that
long
thought
hath
held
me
far
from
here
i
shall
to
obey
our
queen
content
myself
with
relating
a
story
belike
much
slighter
than
that
which
i
might
have
bethought
myself
to
tell
had
my
mind
been
present
here
recounting
to
you
the
silly
default
of
a
damsel
corrected
by
an
uncle
of
hers
with
a
jocular
retort
had
she
been
woman
enough
to
have
apprehended
it
a
certain
fresco
da
celatico
then
had
a
niece
familiarly
called
ciesca
who
having
a
comely
face
and
person
though
none
of
those
angelical
beauties
that
we
have
often
seen
aforetime
set
so
much
store
by
herself
and
accounted
herself
so
noble
that
she
had
gotten
a
habit
of
carping
at
both
men
and
women
and
everything
she
saw
without
anywise
taking
thought
to
herself
who
was
so
much
more
fashous
froward
and
humoursome
than
any
other
of
her
sex
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
her
liking
beside
all
this
she
was
so
prideful
that
had
she
been
of
the
blood
royal
of
france
it
had
been
overweening
and
when
she
went
abroad
she
gave
herself
so
many
airs
that
she
did
nought
but
make
wry
faces
as
if
there
came
to
her
a
stench
from
whomsoever
she
saw
or
met
but
letting
be
many
other
vexatious
and
tiresome
fashions
of
hers
it
chanced
one
day
that
she
came
back
to
the
house
where
fresco
was
and
seating
herself
near
him
all
full
of
airs
and
grimaces
did
nothing
but
puff
and
blow
whereupon
quoth
he
meaneth
this
ciesca
that
being
a
holiday
thou
comest
home
so
early
to
which
she
answered
all
like
to
die
away
with
affectation
is
true
i
have
come
back
soon
for
that
i
believe
there
were
never
in
this
city
so
many
disagreeable
and
tiresome
people
both
men
and
women
as
there
are
there
passeth
none
about
the
streets
but
is
hateful
to
me
as
and
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
woman
in
the
world
to
whom
it
is
more
irksome
to
see
disagreeable
folk
than
it
is
to
me
wherefore
i
have
returned
thus
early
not
to
see
them
lass
rejoined
fresco
to
whom
his
niece
airs
and
graces
were
mighty
displeasing
disagreeable
folk
be
so
distasteful
to
thee
as
thou
sayest
never
mirror
thyself
in
the
glass
so
thou
wouldst
live
merry
but
she
emptier
than
a
reed
albeit
herseemed
she
was
a
match
for
solomon
in
wit
apprehended
fresco
true
speech
no
better
than
a
block
nay
she
said
that
she
chose
to
mirror
herself
in
the
glass
like
other
women
and
so
she
abode
in
her
folly
and
therein
abideth
yet
footnote
an
abbreviation
of
francesca
the
ninth
story
day
the
sixth
guido
cavalcanti
with
a
pithy
speech
courteously
flouteth
certain
florentine
gentlemen
who
had
taken
him
by
surprise
the
queen
seeing
emilia
delivered
of
her
story
and
that
it
rested
with
none
other
than
herself
to
tell
saving
him
who
was
privileged
to
speak
last
began
thus
although
sprightly
ladies
you
have
this
day
taken
out
of
my
mouth
at
the
least
two
stories
whereof
i
had
purposed
to
relate
one
i
have
yet
one
left
to
tell
the
end
whereof
compriseth
a
saying
of
such
a
fashion
that
none
peradventure
of
such
pertinence
hath
yet
been
cited
to
us
you
must
know
then
that
there
were
in
our
city
of
times
past
many
goodly
and
commendable
usances
whereof
none
is
left
there
nowadays
thanks
to
the
avarice
that
hath
waxed
therein
with
wealth
and
hath
banished
them
all
among
these
there
was
a
custom
to
the
effect
that
the
gentlemen
of
the
various
quarters
of
florence
assembled
together
in
divers
places
about
the
town
and
formed
themselves
into
companies
of
a
certain
number
having
a
care
to
admit
thereinto
such
only
as
might
aptly
bear
the
expense
whereof
the
one
and
the
other
and
so
all
in
turn
hold
open
house
each
his
day
for
the
whole
company
at
these
banquets
they
often
entertained
both
stranger
gentlemen
whenas
there
came
any
thither
and
those
of
the
city
and
on
like
wise
once
at
the
least
in
the
year
they
clad
themselves
alike
and
rode
in
procession
through
the
city
on
the
most
notable
days
and
whiles
they
held
passes
of
arms
especially
on
the
chief
holidays
or
whenas
some
glad
news
of
victory
or
the
like
came
to
the
city
amongst
these
companies
was
one
of
messer
betto
brunelleschi
whereinto
the
latter
and
his
companions
had
studied
amain
to
draw
guido
son
of
messer
cavalcante
de
cavalcanti
and
not
without
cause
for
that
besides
being
one
of
the
best
logicians
in
the
world
and
an
excellent
natural
philosopher
of
which
things
indeed
they
recked
little
he
was
very
sprightly
and
and
a
mighty
man
and
knew
better
than
any
other
to
do
everything
that
he
would
and
that
pertained
unto
a
gentleman
more
by
token
that
he
was
very
rich
and
knew
how
to
entertain
whomsoever
he
deemed
deserving
of
honour
but
messer
betto
had
never
been
able
to
win
and
to
have
him
and
he
and
his
companions
believed
that
this
betided
for
that
guido
being
whiles
engaged
in
abstract
speculations
became
much
distraught
from
mankind
and
for
that
he
inclined
somewhat
to
the
opinion
of
the
epicureans
it
was
reported
among
the
common
folk
that
these
his
speculations
consisted
only
in
seeking
if
it
might
be
discovered
that
god
was
not
it
chanced
one
day
that
guido
set
out
from
orto
san
michele
and
came
by
way
of
the
corso
degli
ademari
the
which
was
oftentimes
his
road
to
san
giovanni
round
about
which
there
were
at
that
present
divers
great
marble
tombs
which
are
nowadays
at
santa
reparata
and
many
others
as
he
was
between
the
columns
of
porphyry
there
and
the
tombs
in
question
and
the
door
of
the
church
which
was
shut
messer
betto
and
his
company
coming
along
the
piazza
di
santa
reparata
espied
him
among
the
tombs
and
said
us
go
plague
him
accordingly
spurring
their
horses
they
charged
all
down
upon
him
in
sport
and
coming
upon
him
ere
he
was
aware
of
them
said
to
him
thou
refusest
to
be
of
our
company
but
harkye
whenas
thou
shalt
have
found
that
god
is
not
what
wilt
thou
have
accomplished
guido
seeing
himself
hemmed
in
by
them
answered
promptly
you
may
say
what
you
will
to
me
in
your
own
house
then
laying
his
hand
on
one
of
the
great
tombs
aforesaid
and
being
very
nimble
of
body
he
took
a
spring
and
alighting
on
the
other
side
made
off
having
thus
rid
himself
of
them
the
gentlemen
abode
looking
one
upon
another
and
fell
that
he
was
a
and
that
this
that
he
had
answered
them
amounted
to
nought
seeing
that
there
where
they
were
they
had
no
more
to
do
than
all
the
other
citizens
nor
guido
himself
less
than
any
of
themselves
but
messer
betto
turned
to
them
and
said
is
you
who
are
the
crackbrains
if
you
have
not
apprehended
him
he
hath
courteously
and
in
a
few
words
given
us
the
sharpest
rebuke
in
the
world
for
that
an
you
consider
aright
these
tombs
are
the
houses
of
the
dead
seeing
they
are
laid
and
abide
therein
and
these
saith
he
are
our
house
meaning
thus
to
show
us
that
we
and
other
foolish
and
unlettered
men
are
compared
with
him
and
other
men
of
learning
worse
than
dead
folk
wherefore
being
here
we
are
in
our
own
house
thereupon
each
understood
what
guido

of

which
remained
in

broke
off

went

when
he
said

were
in
the
church
among
many

two
roguish
young
fellows
hight
one
giovanni
del
bragioniera
and
the
other
biagio
pizzini
who
after
laughing
with
one
another
awhile
over
fra

relic
took
counsel
together
for
all
they
were
great
friends
and
cronies
of
his
to
play
him
some
trick
in
the
matter
of
the
feather
in
question
accordingly
having
learned
that
he
was
to
dine
that
morning
with
a
friend
of
his
in
the
burgh
they
went
down
into
the
street
as
soon
as
they
knew
him
to
be
at
table
and
betook
themselves
to
the
inn
where
he
had
alighted
purposing
that
biagio
should
hold
his
servant
in
parley
whilst
giovanni
should
search
his
baggage
for
the
feather
aforesaid
whatever
it
might
be
and
carry
it
off
to
see
what
he
should
say
to
the
people
of
the
matter
fra

had
a
servant
whom
some
called
guccio
balena
others
guccio
imbratta
and
yet
others
guccia
porco
and
who
was
such
a
scurvy
knave
that
lipo
topo
never
wrought
his
like
inasmuch
as
his
master
used
oftentimes
to
jest
of
him
with
his
cronies
and
say
servant
hath
in
him
nine
defaults
such
that
were
one
of
them
in
solomon
or
aristotle
or
seneca
it
would
suffice
to
mar
all
their
worth
all
their
wit
and
all
their
sanctity
consider
then
what
a
man
he
must
be
who
hath
all
nine
of
them
and
in
whom
there
is
neither
worth
nor
wit
nor
sanctity
being
questioned
whiles
what
were
these
nine
defaults
and
having
put
them
into
doggerel
rhyme
he
would
answer

tell
you

a

a
sloven
a
slugabed

neglectful
ill
bred
a
dunderhead
beside
which
he
hath
divers
other
peccadilloes
whereof
it
booteth
not
to
speak
but
what
is
most
laughable
of
all
his
fashions
is
that
wherever
he
goeth
he
is
still
for
taking
a
wife
and
hiring
a
house
for
having
a
big
black
greasy
beard
he
is
so
exceeding
handsome

agreeable
that
he
conceiteth
himself
all
the
women
who
see
him
fall
in
love
with
him
and
if
you
let
him
alone
he
would
run
after
them
all
till
he
lost
his
girdle

to
say
he
is
of
great
assistance
to
me
for
that
none
can
ever
seek
to
speak
with
me
so
secretly
but
he
must
needs
hear
his
share
and
if
it
chance
that
i
be
questioned
of
aught
he
is
so
fearful
lest
i
should
not

into

accordingly
found

busy
about

whereat
they
were
well
pleased
for
that
it
spared
them
half
their
pains
and
entering
fra

chamber
which
they
found
open
the
first
thing
that
came
under
their
examination
was
the
wherein
was
the
feather
in
these
they
found
enveloped
in
a
great
taffetas
wrapper
a
little
casket
and
opening
this
latter
discovered
therein
a
which
they
concluded
must
be
that
which
the
friar
had
promised
to
show
the
people
of
certaldo
and
certes
he
might
lightly
cause
it
to
be
believed
in
those
days
for
that
the
refinements
of
egypt
had
not
yet
made
their
way
save
into
a
small
part
of
tuscany
as
they
have
since
done
in
very
great
abundance
to
the
undoing
of
all
italy
and
wherever
they
may
have
been
some
little
known
in
those
parts
they
were
well
nigh
altogether
unknown
of
the
inhabitants
nay
the
rude
honesty
of
the
ancients
yet
enduring
there
not
only
had
they
never
set
eyes
on
a
parrot
but
were
far
from
having
ever
heard
tell
of
such
a
bird
the
young
men
then
rejoiced
at
finding
the
feather
laid
hands
on
it
and
not
to
leave
the
casket
empty
filled
it
with
some
coals
they
saw
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
shut
it
again
then
putting
all
things
in
order
as
they
had
found
them
they
made
off
in
high
glee
with
the
feather
without
having
been
seen
and
began
to
await
what
fra
cipolli
should
say
when
he
found
the
coals
in
place
thereof
the
simple
men
and
women
who
were
in
the
church
hearing
that
they
were
to
see
the
angel
gabriel
feather
after
none
returned
home
as
soon
as
mass
was
over
and
neighbor
telling
it
to
neighbor
and
gossip
to
gossip
no
sooner
had
they
all
dined
than
so
many
men
and
women
flocked
to
the
burgh
that
it
would
scarce
hold
them
all
looking
eagerly
to
see
the
aforesaid
feather
fra
cipolla
having
well
dined
and
after
slept
awhile
arose
a
little
after
none
and
hearing
of
the
great
multitude
of
country
folk
come
to
see
the
feather
sent
to
bid
guccio
imbratta
come
thither
with
the
bells
and
bring
his
guccio
tearing
himself
with
difficulty
away
from
the
kitchen
and
nuta
betook
himself
with
the
things
required
to
the
appointed
place
whither
coming
out
of
breath
for
that
the
water
he
had
drunken
had
made
his
belly
swell
amain
he
repaired
by
his
master
commandment
to
the
church
door
and
fell
to
ringing
the
bells
lustily
when
all
the
people
were
assembled
there
fra
cipolla
without
observing
that
aught
of
his
had
been
meddled
with
began
his
preachment
and
said
many
words
anent
his
affairs
after
which
thinking
to
come
to
the
showing
of
the
angel
gabriel
feather
he
first
recited
the
confiteor
with
the
utmost
solemnity
and
let
kindle
a
pair
of
flambeaux
then
pulling
off
his
bonnet
he
delicately
unfolded
the
taffetas
wrapper
and
brought
out
the
casket
having
first
pronounced
certain
ejaculations
in
praise
and
commendation
of
the
angel
gabriel
and
of
his
relic
he
opened
the
casket
and
seeing
it
full
of
coals
suspected
not
guccio
balena
of
having
played
him
this
trick
for
that
he
knew
him
not
to
be
man
enough
nor
did
he
curse
him
for
having
kept
ill
watch
lest
others
should
do
it
but
silently
cursed
himself
for
having
committed
to
him
the
care
of
his
gear
knowing
him
as
he
did
to
be
negligent
disobedient
careless
and
forgetful
nevertheless
without
changing
colour
he
raised
his
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
and
said
so
as
to
be
heard
of
all
god
praised
be
still
thy
puissance
then
shutting
the
casket
and
turning
to
the
people
and
ladies
quoth
he
must
know
that
whilst
i
was
yet
very
young
i
was
dispatched
by
my
superior
to
those
parts
where
the
sun
riseth
and
it
was
expressly
commanded
me
that
i
should
seek
till
i
found
the
privileges
of
porcellana
which
though
they
cost
nothing
to
seal
are
much
more
useful
to
others
than
to
us
on
this
errand
i
set
out
from
venice
and
passed
through
borgo
de
greci
whence
riding
through
the
kingdom
of
algarve
and
baldacca
i
came
to

from
there
not
without
thirst
i
came
after
awhile
into

it

set
out

all

explored

passing
the

came
into
truffia

countries
much
inhabited
and
with
great
populations
and
thence
into
the
land
of
menzogna
where
i
found
great
plenty
of
our
brethren
and
of
friars
of
other
religious
orders
who
all
went
about
those
parts
shunning
unease
for
the
love

god
recking
little

travail
whenas
they
saw
their
own
advantage
to
ensue
and
spending
none
other
money
than
such
as
was
uncoined
thence
i
passed
into
the
land
of
the
abruzzi
where
the
men
and
women
go
in
clogs
over
the
mountains
clothing
the
swine
in
their
own
guts
and
a
little
farther
i
found
folk
who
carried
bread
on
sticks
and
wine
in
bags
from
this
i
came
to
the
mountains
of
the
bachi
where
all
the
waters
run
down
hill
and
in
brief
i
made
my
way
so
far
inward

i
won
at

even
to

pastinaca

i
swear
to
you

not

leave
you
disconsolate
i
will
tell
you
some
thereof
first
he
showed
me
the
finger
of
the
holy
ghost
as
whole
and
sound
as
ever
it
was
and
the
forelock
of
the
seraph

appeared

appeared

of

he
fought
with
the

and
the

of
the
death
of
lazarus
and
others
and
for
that
i
made
him
a

gift
of
the
steeps
of
monte
morello
in
the
vernacular
and
of
some
chapters
of
the
caprezio
which
he
had
long
gone
seeking
he
made
me
a
sharer
in
his
holy
relics
and
gave
me
one
of
the
teeth
of
the
holy
rood
and
somewhat
of
the
sound
of
the
bells
of

not

i
gave

hath
a

gave
me
also
of
the
coals

the
most
blessed
martyr
lawrence
was
roasted
all
which
things
i
devoutly
brought
home
with

by

letters
received
from

he
hath
been

now
i
carry
the
angel
gabriel
feather
so
it
may
not
be
marred
in
one
casket
and
the
coals
wherewith
lawrence
was
roasted
in
another
the
which
are
so
like
one
to
other
that
it
hath
often
happened
to
me
to
take
one
for
the
other
and
so
hath
it
betided
me
at
this
present
for
that
thinking
to
bring
hither
the
casket
wherein
was
the
feather
i
have
brought
that
wherein
are
the
coals
the
which
i
hold
not
to
have
been
an
error
nay
meseemeth
certain
that
it
was
god
will
and
that
he
himself
placed
the
casket
with
the
coals
in
my
hands
especially
now
i
mind
me
that
the
feast
of
lawrence
is
but
two
days
hence
wherefore
god
willing
that
by
showing
you
the
coals
wherewith
he
was
roasted
i
should
rekindle
in
your
hearts
the
devotion
it
behoveth
you
have
for
him
caused
me
take
not
the
feather
as
i
purposed
but
the
blessed
coals
extinguished
by
the
sweat
of
that
most
holy
body
so
o
my
blessed
children
put
off
your
bonnets
and
draw
near
devoutly
to
behold
them
but
first
i
would
have
you
knew
that
whoso
is
scored
with
these
coals
in
the
form
of
the
sign
of
the
cross
may
rest
assured
for
the
whole
year
to
come
that
fire
shall
not
touch
him
but
he
shall
feel
it
having
thus
spoken
he
opened
the
casket
chanting
the
while
a
canticle
in
praise
of
lawrence
and
showed
the
coals
which
after
the
simple
multitude
had
awhile
beheld
with
reverent
admiration
they
all
crowded
about
fra
cipolla
and
making
him
better
offerings
than
they
were
used
besought
him
to
touch
them
withal
accordingly
taking
the
coals
in
hand
he
fell
to
making
the
biggest
crosses
for
which
he
could
find
room
upon
their
white
smocks
and
doublets
and
upon
the
veils
of
the
women
avouching
that
how
much
soever
the
coals
diminished
in
making
these
crosses
they
after
grew
again
in
the
casket
as
he
had
many
a
time
proved
on
this
wise
he
crossed
all
the
people
of
certaldo
to
his
no
small
profit
and
thus
by
his
ready
wit
and
presence
of
mind
he
baffled
those
who
by
taking
the
feather
from
him
had
thought
to
baffle
him
and
who
being
present
at
his
preachment
and
hearing
the
rare
shift
employed
by
him
and
from
how
far
he
had
taken
it
and
with
what
words
had
so
laughed
that
they
thought
to
have
cracked
their
jaws
then
after
the
common
folk
had
departed
they
went
up
to
him
and
with
all
the
mirth
in
the
world
discovered
to
him
that
which
they
had
done
and
after
restored
him
his
feather
which
next
year
stood
him
in
as
good
stead
as
the
coals
had
done
that
day
this
story
afforded
unto
all
the
company
alike
the
utmost
pleasure
and
solace
and
it
was
much
laughed
of
all
at
fra
cipolla
and
particularly
of
his
pilgrimage
and
the
relics
seen
and
brought
back
by
him
the
queen
seeing
the
story
and
likewise
her
sovantry
at
an
end
rose
to
her
feet
and
put
off
the
crown
which
she
set
laughingly
on
dioneo
head
saying
it
is
time
dioneo
that
thou
prove
awhile
what
manner
charge
it
is
to
have
ladies
to
govern
and
guide
be
thou
then
king
and
rule
on
such
wise
that
in
the
end
we
may
have
reason
to
give
ourselves
joy
of
thy
governance
dioneo
took
the
crown
and
answered
laughing
you
may
often
enough
have
seen
much
better
kings
than
i
i
mean
but
an
you
obey
me
as
a
king
should
in
truth
be
obeyed
i
will
cause
you
enjoy
that
without
which
assuredly
no
entertainment
is
ever
complete
in
its
gladness
but
let
that
talk
be
i
will
rule
as
best
i
know
then
sending
for
the
seneschal
according
to
the
wonted
usance
he
orderly
enjoined
him
of
that
which
he
should
do
during
the
continuance
of
his
seignory
and
after
said
noble
ladies
it
hath
in
divers
manners
been
devised
of
human
industry
and
of
the
various
chances
of
fortune
insomuch
that
had
not
dame
licisca
come
hither
a
while
agone
and
found
me
matter
with
her
prate
for
our
morrow
relations
i
misdoubt
me
i
should
have
been
long
at
pains
to
find
a
subject
of
discourse
as
you
heard
she
avouched
that
she
had
not
a
single
gossip
who
had
come
to
her
husband
a
maid
and
added
that
she
knew
right
well
how
many
and
what
manner
tricks
married
women
yet
played
their
husbands
but
letting
be
the
first
part
which
is
a
childish
matter
methinketh
the
second
should
be
an
agreeable
subject
for
discourse
wherefore
i
will
and
ordain
it
that
since
licisca
hath
given
us
occasion
therefor
it
be
discoursed
of
the
tricks
which
or
for
love
or
for
their
own
preservation
women
have
heretofore
played
their
husbands
with
or
without
the
latter
cognizance
thereof
footnote
in
the
old
sense
of
ingenuity
skilful
procurement
etc
it
seemed
to
some
of
the
ladies
that
to
discourse
of
such
a
matter
would
ill
beseem
them
and
they
prayed
him
therefore
to
change
the
theme
proposed
wherefore
answered
he
ladies
i
am
no
less
cognizant
than
yourselves
of
that
which
i
have
ordained
and
that
which
you
would
fain
allege
to
me
availed
not
to
deter
me
from
ordaining
it
considering
that
the
times
are
such
that
provided
men
and
women
are
careful
to
eschew
unseemly
actions
all
liberty
of
discourse
is
permitted
know
you
not
that
for
the
malignity
of
the
season
the
judges
have
forsaken
the
tribunals
that
the
laws
as
well
divine
as
human
are
silent
and
full
licence
is
conceded
unto
every
one
for
the
preservation
of
his
life
wherefore
if
your
modesty
allow
itself
some
little
freedom
in
discourse
not
with
intent
to
ensue
it
with
aught
of
unseemly
in
deeds
but
to
afford
yourselves
and
others
diversion
i
see
not
with
what
plausible
reason
any
can
blame
you
in
the
future
moreover
your
company
from
the
first
day
of
our
assembling
until
this
present
hath
been
most
decorous
nor
for
aught
that
hath
been
said
here
doth
it
appear
to
me
that
its
honour
hath
anywise
been
sullied
again
who
is
there
knoweth
not
your
virtue
which
not
to
say
mirthful
discourse
but
even
fear
of
death
i
do
not
believe
could
avail
to
shake
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
whosoever
should
hear
that
you
shrank
from
devising
bytimes
of
these
toys
would
be
apt
to
suspect
that
you
were
guilty
in
the
matter
and
were
therefore
unwilling
to
discourse
thereof
to
say
nothing
of
the
fine
honour
you
would
do
me
in
that
i
having
been
obedient
unto
all
you
now
having
made
me
your
king
seek
to
lay
down
the
law
to
me
and
not
to
discourse
of
the
subject
which
i
propose
put
off
then
this
misdoubtance
apter
to
mean
minds
than
to
yours
and
good
luck
to
you
let
each
of
you
bethink
herself
of
some
goodly
story
to
tell
when
the
ladies
heard
this
they
said
it
should
be
as
he
pleased
whereupon
he
gave
them
all
leave
to
do
their
several
pleasures
until
the
sun
was
yet
high
for
that
the
discoursement
had
been
brief
wherefor
dioneo
having
addressed
himself
to
play
at
tables
with
the
other
young
men
elisa
called
the
other
ladies
apart
and
said
to
them
since
we
have
been
here
i
have
still
wished
to
carry
you
to
a
place
very
near
at
hand
whither
methinketh
none
of
you
hath
ever
been
and
which
is
called
the
ladies
valley
but
have
never
yet
found
an
occasion
of
bringing
you
thither
unto
wherefore
as
the
sun
is
yet
high
i
doubt
not
but
an
it
please
you
come
thither
you
will
be
exceeding
well
pleased
to
have
been
there
they
answered
that
they
were
ready
and
calling
one
of
their
maids
set
out
upon
their
way
without
letting
the
young
men
know
aught
thereof
nor
had
they
gone
much
more
than
a
mile
when
they
came
to
the
ladies
valley
they
entered
therein
by
a
very
strait
way
on
one
side
whereof
ran
a
very
clear
streamlet
and
saw
it
as
fair
and
as
delectable
especially
at
that
season
whenas
the
heat
was
great
as
most
might
be
conceived
according
to
that
which
one
of
them
after
told
me
the
plain
that
was
in
the
valley
was
as
round
as
if
it
had
been
traced
with
the
compass
albeit
it
seemed
the
work
of
nature
and
not
of
art
and
was
in
circuit
a
little
more
than
half
a
mile
encompassed
about
with
six
little
hills
not
on
the
summit
of
each
of
which
stood
a
palace
builded
in
guise
of
a
goodly
castle
the
sides
of
these
hills
went
sloping
gradually
downward
to
the
plain
on
such
wise
as
we
see
in
amphitheatres
the
degrees
descend
in
ordered
succession
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
still
contracting
their
circuit
and
of
these
slopes
those
which
looked
toward
the
south
were
all
full
of
vines
and
olives
and
almonds
and
cherries
and
figs
and
many
another
kind
of
trees
without
a
span
thereof
being
wasted
whilst
those
which
faced
the
north
star
were
all
covered
with
thickets
of
dwarf
oaks
and
ashes
and
other
trees
as
green
and
straight
as
might
be
the
middle
plain
which
had
no
other
inlet
than
that
whereby
the
ladies
were
come
thither
was
full
of
firs
and
cypresses
and
laurels
and
various
sorts
of
pines
as
well
arrayed
and
ordered
as
if
the
best
artist
in
that
kind
had
planted
them
and
between
these
little
or
no
sun
even
at
its
highest
made
its
way
to
the
ground
which
was
all
one
meadow
of
very
fine
grass
with
flowers
purpurine
and
others
moreover
that
which
afforded
no
less
delight
than
otherwhat
was
a
little
stream
which
ran
down
from
a
valley
that
divided
two
of
the
hills
aforesaid
and
falling
over
cliffs
of
live
rock
made
a
murmur
very
delectable
to
hear
what
while
it
showed
from
afar
as
it
broke
over
the
stones
like
so
much
quicksilver
jetting
out
under
pressure
of
somewhat
into
fine
spray
as
it
came
down
into
the
little
plain
it
was
there
received
into
a
fair
channel
and
ran
very
swiftly
into
the
middest
thereof
where
it
formed
a
lakelet
such
as
the
townsfolk
made
whiles
by
way
of
fishpond
in
their
gardens
whenas
they
have
a
commodity
thereof
this
lakelet
was
no
deeper
than
a
stature
breast
high
and
its
waters
being
exceeding
clear
and
altogether
untroubled
with
any
admixture
it
showed
its
bottom
to
be
of
a
very
fine
gravel
the
grains
whereof
whoso
had
nought
else
to
do
might
an
he
would
have
availed
to
number
nor
looking
into
the
water
was
the
bottom
alone
to
be
seen
nay
but
so
many
fish
fleeting
hither
and
thither
that
over
and
above
the
pleasure
thereof
it
was
a
marvel
to
behold
nor
was
it
enclosed
with
other
banks
than
the
very
soil
of
the
meadow
which
was
the
goodlier
thereabout
in
so
much
as
it
received
the
more
of
its
moisture
the
water
that
abounded
over
and
above
the
capacity
of
the
lake
was
received
into
another
channel
whereby
issuing
forth
of
the
little
valley
it
ran
off
into
the
lower
parts

lit

hither
then
came
the
young
ladies
and
after
they
had
gazed
all
about
and
much
commended
the
place
they
took
counsel
together
to
bathe
for
that
the
heat
was
great
and
that
they
saw
the
lakelet
before
them
and
were
in
no
fear
of
being
seen
accordingly
bidding
their
serving
maid
abide
over
against
the
way
whereby
one
entered
there
and
look
if
any
should
come
and
give
them
notice
thereof
they
stripped
themselves
naked
all
seven
and
entered
the
lake
which
hid
their
white
bodies
no
otherwise
than
as
a
thin
glass
would
do
with
a
vermeil
rose
then
they
being
therein
and
no
troubling
of
the
water
ensuing
thereof
they
fell
as
best
they
might
to
faring
hither
and
thither
in
pursuit
of
the
fish
which
had
uneath
where
to
hide
themselves
and
seeking
to
take
them
with
the
naked
hand
after
they
had
abidden
awhile
in
such
joyous
pastime
and
had
taken
some
of
the
fish
they
came
forth
of
the
lakelet
and
clad
themselves
anew
then
unable
to
commend
the
place
more
than
they
had
already
done
and
themseeming
time
to
turn
homeward
they
set
out
with
soft
step
upon
their
way
discoursing
much
of
the
goodliness
of
the
valley
they
reached
the
palace
betimes

found

at
play

they
had

we
have
stolen

on
you

asked
dioneo
do
you
begin
to
do
deeds
ere

come
to
say
words

my

answered
she
and
related
to
him
at

whence
they
came

how
the

was
fashioned

how
far
distant
thence
and
that
which
they
had
done
the
king
hearing
tell
of
the
goodliness
of
the
place
and
desirous
of
seeing
it
caused
straightway
order
the
supper
which
being
dispatched
to
the
general
satisfaction
the
three
young
men
leaving
the
ladies
betook
themselves
with
their
servants
to
the
valley
and
having
viewed
it
in
every
part
for
that
none
of
them
had
ever
been
there
before
extolled
it
for
one
of
the
goodliest
things
in
the
world
then
for
that
it
grew
late
after
they
had
bathed
and
donned
their
clothes
they
returned
home
where
they
found
the
ladies
dancing
a
round
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
song
sung
by
fiammetta
footnote
alluding
to
the
subject
fixed
for
the
next
discourse
as
who
should
say
have
you
begun
already
to
play
tricks
upon
us
men
in
very
deed
ere
you
tell
about
them
in
words
the
dance
ended
they
entered
with
them
into
a
discourse
of
the
ladies
valley
and
said
much
in
praise
and
commendation
thereof
moreover
the
king
sending
for
the
seneschal
bade
him
look
that
the
dinner
be
made
ready
there
on
the
following
morning
and
have
sundry
beds
carried
thither
in
case
any
should
have
a
mind
to
lie
or
sleep
there
for
nooning
after
which
he
let
bring
lights
and
wine
and
confections
and
the
company
having
somedele
refreshed
themselves
he
commanded
that
all
should
address
themselves
to
dancing
then
pamfilo
having
at
his
commandment
set
up
a
dance
the
king
turned
to
elisa
and
said
courteously
to
her
fair
damsel
thou
has
done
me
the
honour
of
the
crown
and
i
purpose
this
evening
to
do
thee
that
of
the
song
wherefore
look
thou
sing
such
an
one
as
most
liketh
thee
elisa
answered
smiling
that
she
would
well
and
with
dulcet
voice
began
on
this
wise
love
from
thy
clutches

i
but
win
free
hardly
methinks
again
shall
any
other
hook
take
hold
on
me
i
entered
in
thy
wars
a
youngling
maid
thinking
thy
strife
was
utmost
peace
and
sweet
and
all
my
weapons
on
the
ground
i
laid
as
one
secure
undoubting
of
defeat
but
thou
false
tyrant
with
rapacious
heat
didst
fall
on
me
amain
with
all
the
grapnels
of
thine
armoury
then
wound
about
and
fettered
with
thy
chains
to
him
who
for
my
death
in
evil
hour
was
born
thou
me
bounden
full
of
pains
and
bitter
tears
and
syne
within
his
power
he
hath
me
and
his
rule
so
harsh
and
dour
no
sighs
can
move
the
swain
nor
all
my
wasting
plaints
to
set
me
free
my
prayers
the
wild
winds
bear
them
all
away
he
hearkeneth
unto
none
and
none

each
hour
my
torment
waxeth

can
not

irks

ah
lord
have
pity
on
my
heavy
cheer

that
i
seek
in

trust
as
was
my
use
whilere
and
being
quit
of

myself
with
white
flowers
and
with
red
besee
elisa
ended
her
song
with
a
very
plaintive
sigh
and
albeit
all
marvelled
at
the
words
thereof
yet
was
there
none
who
might
conceive
what
it
was
that
caused
her
sing
thus
but
the
king
who
was
in
a
merry
mood
calling
for
tindaro
bade
him
bring
out
his
bagpipes
to
the
sound
whereof
he
let
dance
many
dances
after
which
a
great
part
of
the
night
being
now
past
he
bade
each
go
sleep
here
endeth
the
sixth
day
of
the
decameron
the
here
beginneth
the
seventh
day
of
the
decameron
wherein
under
the
governance
of
dioneo
is
discoursed
of
the
tricks
which
or
for
love
or
for
their
own
preservation
women
have
heretofore
played
their
husbands
with
or
without
the
latter
cognizance
thereof
every
star
was
already
fled
from
the
parts
of
the
east
save
only
that
which
we
style
lucifer
and
which
shone
yet
in
the
whitening
dawn
when
the
seneschal
arising
betook
himself
with
a
great
to
the
ladies
valley
there
to
order
everything
according
to
commandment
had
of
his
lord
the
king
whom
the
noise
of
the
packers
and
of
the
beasts
had
awakened
tarried
not
long
after
his
departure
to
rise
and
being
risen
caused
arouse
all
the
ladies
and
likewise
the
young
men
nor
had
the
rays
of
the
sun
yet
well
broken
forth
when
they
all
entered
upon
the
road
never
yet
had
the
nightingales
and
the
other
birds
seemed
to
them
to
sing
so
blithely
as
they
did
that
morning
what
while
accompanied
by
their
carols
they
repaired
to
the
ladies
valley
where
they
were
received
by
many
more
which
seemed
to
them
to
make
merry
for
their
coming
there
going
round
about
the
place
and
reviewing
it
all
anew
it
appeared
to
them
so
much
fairer
than
on
the
foregoing
day
as
the
season
of
the
day
was
more
sorted
to
its
goodliness
then
after
they
had
broken
their
fast
with
good
wine
and
confections
not
to
be
behindhand
with
the
birds
in
the
matter
of
song
they
fell
and
the
valley
with
them
still
echoing
those
same
songs
which
they
did
sing
whereto
all
the
birds
as
if
they
would
not
be
outdone
added
new
and
dulcet
notes
presently
the
being
come
and
the
tables
spread
hard
by
the
fair
lakelet
under
the
thickset
laurels
and
other
goodly
trees
they
seated
themselves
there
as
it
pleased
the
king
and
eating
watched
the
fish
swim
in
vast
shoals
about
the
lake
which
gave
bytimes
occasion
for
talk
as
well
as
observation
when
they
had
made
an
end
of
dining
and
the
meats
and
tables
were
removed
they
fell
anew
to
singing
more
blithely
than
ever
after
which
beds
having
been
spread
in
various
places
about
the
little
valley
and
all
enclosed
about
by
the
discreet
seneschal
with
curtains
and
canopies
of
french
serge
whoso
would
might
with
the
king
permission
go
sleep
whilst
those
who
had
no
mind
to
sleep
might
at
their
will
take
pleasure
of
their
other
wonted
pastimes
but
after
awhile
all
being
now
arisen
and
the
hour
come
when
they
should
assemble
together
for
carpets
were
at
the
king
commandment
spread
upon
the
grass
not
far
from
the
place
where
they
had
eaten
and
all
having
seated
themselves
thereon
hard
by
the
lake
the
king
bade
emilia
begin
whereupon
she
blithely
proceeded
to
speak
smiling
thus
the
first
story

the
seventh
gianni
lotteringhi
heareth
knock
at
his
door
by
night
and
awakeneth
his
wife
who
giveth
him
to
believe
that
it
is
a
phantom
whereupon
they
go
to
exorcise
it
with
a
certain
orison
and
the
knocking
ceaseth
my
lord
it
had
been
very
agreeable
to
me
were
such
your
pleasure
that
other
than
i
should
have
given
a
beginning
to
so
goodly
a
matter
as
is
that
whereof
we
are
to
speak
but
since
it
pleaseth
you
that
i
give
all
the
other
ladies
assurance
by
my
example
i
will
gladly
do
it
moreover
dearest
ladies
i
will
study
to
tell
a
thing
that
may
be
useful
to
you
in
time
to
come
for
that
if
you
others
are
as
fearful
as
i
and
especially
of
phantoms
though
what
manner
of
thing
they
may
be
god
knoweth
i
know
not
nor
ever
found
i
any
woman
who
knew
it
albeit
all
are
alike
adread
of
them
you
may
by
noting
well
my
story
learn
a
holy
and
goodly
orison
of
great
virtue
for
the
conjuring
them
away
should
they
come
to
you
there
was
once
in
florence
in
the
quarter
of
san
brancazio
a
called
gianni
lotteringhi
a
man
more
fortunate
in
his
craft
than
wise
in
other
things
for
that
savoring
of
the
simpleton
he
was
very
often
made
captain
of
the
laudsingers
of
santa
maria
novella
and
had
the
governance
of
their
confraternity
and
he
many
a
time
had
other
little
offices
of
the
same
kind
upon
which
he
much
valued
himself
this
betided
him
for
that
being
a
man
of
substance
he
gave
many
a
good
pittance
to
the
clergy
who
getting
of
him
often
this
a
pair
of
hose
that
a
gown
and
another
a
scapulary
taught
him
in
return
store
of
goodly
orisons
and
gave
him
the
paternoster
in
the
vulgar
tongue
the
song
of
saint
alexis
the
lamentations
of
saint
bernard
the
canticles
of
madam
matilda
and
the
like
trumpery
all
which
he
held
very
dear
and
kept
very
diligently
for
his
health
now
he
had
a
very
fair
and
lovesome
lady
to
wife
by
name
mistress
tessa
who
was
the
daughter
of
mannuccio
dalla
cuculia
and
was
exceeding
discreet
and
well
advised
she
knowing
her
simplicity
and
being
enamoured
of
federigo
di
neri
pegolotti
a
brisk
and
handsome
youth
and
he
of
her
took
order
with
a
of
hers
that
he
should
come
speak
with
her
at
a
very
goodly
country
house
which
her
husband
had
at
camerata
where
she
sojourned
all
the
summer
and
whither
gianni
came
whiles
to
sup
and
sleep
returning
in
the
morning
to
his
shop
and
bytimes
to
his
laudsingers
footnote
see
note
federigo
who
desired
this
beyond
measure
taking
his
opportunity
repaired
thither
on
the
day
appointed
him
towards
vespers
and
gianni
not
coming
thither
that
evening
supped
and
lay
the
night
in
all
ease
and
delight
with
the
lady
who
being
in
his
arms
taught
him
that
night
a
good
half
dozen
of
her
husband
lauds
then
neither
she
nor
federigo
purposing
that
this
should
be
the
last
as
it
had
been
the
first
time
of
their
foregathering
they
took
order
together
on
this
wise
so
it
should
not
be
needful
to
send
the
maid
for
him
each
time
to
wit
that
every
day
as
he
came
and
went
to
and
from
a
place
he
had
a
little
farther
on
he
should
keep
his
eye
on
a
vineyard
that
adjoined
the
house
where
he
would
see
an
ass
skull
set
up
on
one
of
the
vine
poles
which
whenas
he
saw
with
the
muzzle
turned
towards
florence
he
should
without
fail
and
in
all
assurance
betake
himself
to
her
that
evening
after
dark
and
if
he
found
the
door
shut
he
should
knock
softly
thrice
and
she
would
open
to
him
but
that
whenas
he
saw
the
ass
muzzle
turned
towards
fiesole
he
should
not
come
for
that
gianni
would
be
there
and
doing
on
this
wise
they
foregathered
many
a
time
but
once
amongst
other
times
it
chanced
that
federigo
being
one
night
to
sup
with
mistress
tessa
and
she
having
let
cook
two
fat
capons
gianni
who
was
not
expected
there
that
night
came
thither
very
late
whereat
the
lady
was
much
chagrined
and
having
supped
with
her
husband
on
a
piece
of
salt
pork
which
she
had
let
boil
apart
caused
the
maid
wrap
the
two
boiled
capons
in
a
white
napkin
and
carry
them
together
with
good
store
of
eggs
and
a
flask
of
good
wine
into
a
garden
she
had
whither
she
could
go
without
passing
through
the
house
and
where
she
was
wont
to
sup
whiles
with
her
lover
bidding
her
lay
them
at
the
foot
of
a
that
grew
beside
a
lawn
there
but
such
was
her
trouble
and
annoy
that
she
remembered
not
to
bid
the
maid
wait
till
federigo
should
come
and
tell
him
that
gianni
was
there
and
that
he
should
take
the
viands
from
the
garden
wherefore
she
and
gianni
betaking
themselves
to
bed
and
the
maid
likewise
it
was
not
long
before
federigo
came
to
the
door
and
knocked
softly
once
the
door
was
so
near
to
the
bedchamber
that
gianni
heard
it
incontinent
as
also
did
the
lady
but
she
made
a
show
of
being
asleep
so
her
husband
might
have
no
suspicion
of
her
after
waiting
a
little
federigo
knocked
a
second
time
whereupon
gianni
marvelling
nudged
his
wife
somewhat
and
said
hearest
thou
what
i
hear
meseemeth
there
is
a
knocking
at
our
door
the
lady
who
had
heard
it
much
better
than
he
made
a
show
of
awaking
and
said
how
sayst
thou
say
answered
gianni
meseemeth
there
is
a
knocking
at
our
door
cried
she
gianni
mine
knowst
thou
not
what
it
is
it
is
a
phantom
that
hath
these
last
few
nights
given
me
the
greatest
fright
that
ever
was
insomuch
that
whenas
i
hear
it
i
put
my
head
under
the
clothes
and
dare
not
bring
it
out
again
until
it
is
broad
day
quoth
gianni
to
wife
have
no
fear
if
it
be
so
for
i
said
the
and
the
and
such
and
such
other
pious
orisons
before
we
lay
down
and
crossed
the
bed
from
side
to
side
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
so
that
we
have
no
need
to
fear
for
that
what
power
soever
it
have
it
can
not
avail
to
harm
us
the
lady
fearing
lest
federigo
should
perchance
suspect
otherwhat
and
be
angered
with
her
determined
at
all
hazards
to
arise
and
let
him
know
that
gianni
was
there
wherefore
quoth
she
to
her
husband
is
all
very
well
thou
sayst
thy
words
thou
but
for
my
part
i
shall
never
hold
myself
safe
nor
secure
except
we
exorcise
it
since
thou
art
here
how
is
it
to
be
exorcised
asked
he
and
she
know
full
well
how
to
exorcise
it
for
the
other
day
when
i
went
to
the
pardon
at
fiesole
a
certain
anchoress
the
very
holiest
of
creatures
gianni
mine
god
only
can
say
how
holy
she
is
seeing
me
thus
fearful
taught
me
a
pious
and
effectual
orison
and
told
me
that
she
had
made
trial
of
it
several
times
ere
she
became
a
recluse
and
that
it
had
always
availed
her
god
knoweth
i
should
never
have
dared
go
alone
to
make
proof
of
it
but
now
that
thou
art
here
i
would
have
us
go
exorcise
the
phantom
gianni
answered
that
he
would
well
and
accordingly
they
both
arose
and
went
softly
to
the
door
without
which
federigo
who
now
began
to
misdoubt
him
of
somewhat
was
yet
in
waiting
when
they
came
thither
the
lady
said
to
gianni
thou
spit
whenas
i
shall
bid
thee
and
he
answered
then
she
began
the
conjuration
and
said
phantom
that
goest
by
night
with
tail
upright
thou
to
us
now
get
thee
gone
with
tail
upright
begone
into
the
garden
to
the
foot
of
the
great
peach
tree
there
shalt
thou
find
an
anointed
one
and
an
hundred
turds
of
my
sitting
hen
set
thy
mouth
to
the
flagon
and
get
thee
gone
again
and
do
thou
no
hurt
to
my
gianni
nor
to
me
then
to
her
husband
gianni
quoth
she
and
he
spat
federigo
who
heard
all
this
from
without
and
was
now
quit
of
jealousy
had
for
all
his
vexation
so
great
a
mind
to
laugh
that
he
was
like
to
burst
and
when
gianni
spat
he
said
under
his
breath
would
it

with
her

whilst
federigo
who
had
not
supped
looking
to
sup
with
her
and
had
right
well
apprehended
the
words

himself
to

ass
skull
towards
fiesole
but
that
a
husbandman
passing
through
the
vineyard
had
given
it
a
blow
with
a
stick
and
caused
it
spin
round
and
it
had
become
turned
towards
florence
wherefore
federigo
thinking
himself
summoned
had
come
thither
and
that
the
lady
had
made
the
conjuration
on
this
wise
phantom
get
thee
gone
in
god
name
for
it
was
not
i
turned
the
ass
head
but
another
it
was
god
put
him
to
shame
and
i
am
here
with
my
gianni
in
bed
whereupon
he
went
away
and
abode
without
supper
or
lodging
but
a
neighbour
of
mine
a
very
ancient
lady
telleth
me
that
according
to
that
which
she
heard
when
a
child
both
the
one
and
the
other
were
true
but
that
the
latter
happened
not
to
gianni
lotteringhi
but
to
one
gianni
di
nello
who
abode
at
porta
san
piero
and
was
no
less
exquisite
a
ninny
than
the
other
wherefore
dear
my
ladies
it
abideth
at
your
election
to
take
whether
of
the
two
orisons
most
pleaseth
you
except
you
will
have
both
they
have
great
virtue
in
such
cases
as
you
have
had
proof
in
the
story
you
have
heard
get
them
therefore
by
heart
and
they
may
yet
avail
you
the
second
story
day
the
seventh
peronella
hideth
a
lover
of
hers
in
a
vat
upon
her
husband
unlooked
for
return
and
hearing
from
the
latter
that
he
hath
sold
the
vat
avoucheth
herself
to
have
sold
it
to
one
who
is
presently
therewithin
to
see
if
it
be
sound
whereupon
the
gallant
jumping
out
of
the
vat
causeth
the
husband
scrape
it
out
for
him
and
after
carry
it
home
to
his
house
emilia
story
was
received
with
loud
laughter
and
the
conjuration
commended
of
all
as
goodly
and
excellent
and
this
come
to
an
end
the
king
bade
filostrato
follow
on
who
accordingly
began
dearest
ladies
so
many
are
the
tricks
that
men
and
particularly
husbands
play
you
that
if
some
woman
chance
whiles
to
put
a
cheat
upon
her
husband
you
should
not
only
be
blithe
that
this
hath
happened
and
take
pleasure
in
coming
to
know
it
or
hearing
it
told
of
any
but
should
yourselves
go
telling
it
everywhere
so
men
may
understand
that
if
they
are
knowing
women
on
their
part
are
no
less
so
the
which
can
not
be
other
than
useful
unto
you
for
that
when
one
knoweth
that
another
is
on
the
alert
he
setteth
himself
not
overlightly
to
cozen
him
who
then
can
doubt
but
that
which
we
shall
say
concerning
this
matter
coming
to
be
known
of
men
may
be
exceeding
effectual
in
restraining
them
from
cozening
you
ladies
whenas
they
find
that
you
likewise
know
how
to
cozen
an
you
will
i
purpose
therefore
to
tell
you
the
trick
which
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
a
young
woman
albeit
she
was
of
mean
condition
played
her
husband
for
her
own
preservation
in
naples
no
great
while
agone
there
was
a
poor
man
who
took
to
wife
a
fair
and
lovesome
damsel
called
peronella
and
albeit
he
with
his
craft
which
was
that
of
a
mason
and
she
by
spinning
earned
but
a
slender
pittance
they
ordered
their
life
as
best
they
might
it
chanced
one
day
that
a
young
gallant
of
the
neighbourhood
saw
this
peronella
and
she
pleasing
him
mightily
he
fell
in
love
with
her
and
importuned
her
one
way
and
another
till
he
became
familiar
with
her
and
they
took
order
with
each
other
on
this
wise
so
they
might
be
together
to
wit
seeing
that
her
husband
arose
every
morning
betimes
to
go
to
work
or
to
find
work
they
agreed
that
the
young
man
should
be
whereas
he
might
see
him
go
out
and
that
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
the
street
where
she
abode
which
was
called
avorio
being
very
solitary
he
should
come
to
her
house
on
this
wise
they
did
many
times
but
one
morning
the
good
man
having
gone
out
and
giannello
strignario
for
so
was
the
lover
named
having
entered
the
house
and
being
with
peronella
it
chanced
that
after
awhile
the
husband
returned
home
whereas
it
was
his
wont
to
be
abroad
all
day
and
finding
the
door
locked
within
knocked
and
after
fell
in
himself
my
god
praised
be
thou
ever
for
though
thou
hast
made
me
poor
at
least
thou
hast
comforted
me
with
a
good
and
honest
damsel
to
wife
see
how
she
locked
the
door
within
as
soon
as
i
was
gone
out
so
none
might
enter
to
do
her
any
annoy
peronella
knowing
her
husband
by
his
way
of
knocking
said
to
her
lover
giannello
mine
i
am
a
dead
woman
for
here
is
my
husband
whom
god
confound
come
back
and
i
know
not
what
this
meaneth
for
never
yet
came
he
back
hither
at
this
hour
belike
he
saw
thee
whenas
thou
enteredst
here
but
for
the
love
of
god
however
the
case
may
be
get
thee
into
yonder
vat
whilst
i
go
open
to
him
and
we
shall
see
what
is
the
meaning
of
his
returning
home
so
early
this
morning
accordingly
giannello
betook
himself
in
all
haste
into
the
vat
whilst
peronella
going
to
the
door
opened
to
her
husband
and
said
to
him
with
an
angry
air
is
to
do
now
that
thou
returnest
home
so
soon
this
morning
meseemeth
thou
hast
a
mind
to
do
nought
that
i
see
thee
come
back
tools
in
hand
and
if
thou
do
thus
on
what
are
we
to
live
whence
shall
we
get
bread
thinkest
thou
i
will
suffer
thee
pawn
my
gown
and
my
other
poor
clothes
i
who
do
nothing
but
spin
day
and
night
till
the
flesh
is
come
apart
from
my
nails
so
i
may
at
the
least
have
so
much
oil
as
will
keep
our
lamp
burning
husband
husband
there
is
not
a
neighbour
wife
of
ours
but
marvelleth
thereat
and
maketh
mock
of
me
for
the
pains
i
give
myself
and
all
that
i
endure
and
thou
thou
returnest
home
to
me
with
thy
hands
whenas
thou
shouldst
be
at
work
so
saying
she
fell
and
went
on
to
say
woe
is
me
unhappy
woman
that
i
am
in
what
an
ill
hour
was
i
born
at
what
an
ill
moment
did
i
come
hither
i
who
might
have
had
a
young
man
of
such
worth
and
would
none
of
him
so
i
might
come
to
this
fellow
here
who
taketh
no
thought
to
her
whom
he
hath
brought
home
other
women
give
themselves
a
good
time
with
their
lovers
for
there
is
none
i
know
but
hath
two
and
some
three
and
they
enjoy
themselves
and
show
their
husbands
the
moon
for
the
sun
but
i
wretch
that
i
am
because
i
am
good
and
occupy
myself
not
with
such
toys
i
suffer
ill
and
ill
hap
i
know
not
why
i
do
not
take
me
a
lover
as
do
other
women
understand
well
husband
mine
that
had
i
a
mind
to
do
ill
i
could
soon
enough
find
the
wherewithal
for
there
be
store
of
brisk
young
fellows
who
love
me
and
wish
me
well
and
have
sent
to
me
proffering
money
galore
or
dresses
and
jewels
at
my
choice
but
my
heart
would
never
suffer
me
to
do
it
for
that
i
was
no
mother
daughter
of
that
ilk
and
here
thou
comest
home
to
me
whenas
thou
shouldst
be
at
work
lack
wife
answered
the
husband
not
thyself
for
sake
thou
shouldst
be
assured
that
i
know
what
manner
of
woman
thou
art
and
indeed
this
morning
i
have
in
part
had
proof
thereof
it
is
true
that
i
went
out
to
go
to
work
but
it
seemeth
thou
knowest
not
as
i
myself
knew
not
that
this
is
the
of
san
galeone
and
there
is
no
work
doing
that
is
why
i
am
come
back
at
this
hour
but
none
the
less
i
have
provided
and
found
a
means
how
we
shall
have
bread
for
more
than
a
month
for
i
have
sold
yonder
man
thou
seest
here
with
me
the
vat
which
as
thou
knowest
hath
this
long
while
cumbered
the
house
and
he
is
to
give
me
five
for
it
quoth
peronella
much
the
more
cause
have
i
to
complain
thou
who
art
a
man
and
goest
about
and
should
be
versed
in
the
things
of
the
world
thou
hast
sold
a
vat
for
five
florins
whilst
i
a
poor
silly
woman
who
hath
scarce
ever
been
without
the
door
seeing
the
hindrance
it
gave
us
in
the
house
have
sold
it
for
seven
to
an
honest
man
who
entered
it
but
now
as
thou
camest
back
to
see
if
it
were
sound
when
the
husband
heard
this
he
was
more
than
satisfied
and
said
to
him
who
had
come
for
the
vat
man
begone
in
peace
for
thou
hearest
that
my
wife
hath
sold
the
vat
for
seven
florins
whereas
thou
wast
to
give
me
but
five
for
it
replied
the
other
and
went
his
way
whereupon
quoth
peronella
to
her
husband
thou
art
here
come
up
and
settle
with
him
thyself
giannello
who
abode
with
his
ears
pricked
up
to
hear
if
it
behoved
him
fear
or
be
on
his
guard
against
aught
hearing
his
mistress
words
straightway
scrambled
out
of
the
vat
and
cried
out
as
if
he
had
heard
nothing
of
the
husband
return
art
thou
good
wife
whereupon
the
goodman
coming
up
answered
am
i
what
wouldst
thou
have
art
thou
asked
giannello
want
the
woman
with
whom
i
made
the
bargain
for
this
vat
quoth
the
other
may
deal
with
me
in
all
assurance
for
i
am
her
husband
then
said
giannello
vat
appeareth
to
me
sound
enough
but
meseemeth
you
have
kept
dregs
or
the
like
therein
for
it
is
all
overcrusted
with
i
know
not
what
that
is
so
hard
and
dry
that
i
can
not
remove
aught
thereof
with
my
nails
wherefore
i
will
not
take
it
except
i
first
see
it
clean
answered
peronella
bargain
shall
not
fall
through
for
that
my
husband
will
clean
it
all
out
will
i
rejoined
the
latter
and
laying
down
his
tools
put
off
his
coat
then
calling
for
a
light
and
a
scraper
he
entered
the
vat
and
fell
to
scraping
peronella
as
if
she
had
a
mind
to
see
what
he
did
thrust
her
head
and
one
of
her
arms
shoulder
and
all
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
vat
which
was
not
overbig
and
fell
to
saying
here
and
and
also
and
here
is
a
little
left
footnote
so
called
from
the
figure
of
a
lily
stamped
on
the
coin
cf
our
whilst
she
was
thus
engaged
in
directing
her
husband
and
showing
him
where
to
scrape
giannello
who
had
scarce
yet
that
morning
done
his
full
desire
when
they
were
interrupted
by
the
mason
coming
seeing
that
he
could
not
as
he
would
bethought
himself
to
accomplish
it
as
he
might
wherefore
boarding
her
as
she
held
the
mouth
of
the
vat
all
closed
up
on
such
wise
as
in
the
ample
plains
the
unbridled
stallions
afire
with
love
assail
the
mares
of
parthia
he
satisfied
his
juvenile
ardour
the
which
enterprise
was
brought
to
perfection
well
nigh
at
the
same
moment
as
the
scraping
of
the
vat
whereupon
he
dismounted
and
peronella
withdrawing
her
head
from
the
mouth
of
the
vat
the
husband
came
forth
thereof
then
said
she
to
her
gallant
this
light
good
man
and
look
if
it
be
clean
to
thy
mind
giannello
looked
in
and
said
that
it
was
well
and
that
he
was
satisfied
and
giving
the
husband
seven
florins
caused
carry
the
vat
to
his
own
house
the
third
story
day
the
seventh
fra
rinaldo
lieth
with
his
gossip
and
being
found
of
her
husband
closeted
with
her
in
her
chamber
they
give
him
to
believe
that
he
was
in
act
to
conjure
worms
from
his
godson
filostrato
had
not
known
to
speak
so
obscurely
of
the
mares
of
parthia
but
that
the
roguish
ladies
laughed
thereat
making
believe
to
laugh
at
otherwhat
but
when
the
king
saw
that
his
story
was
ended
he
bade
elisa
tell
who
accordingly
with
obedient
readiness
began
charming
ladies
emilia
conjuration
of
the
phantom
hath
brought
to
my
memory
the
story
of
another
conjuration
which
latter
though
it
be
not
so
goodly
as
hers
nevertheless
for
that
none
other
bearing
upon
our
subject
occurreth
to
me
at
this
present
i
will
proceed
to
relate
you
must
know
that
there
was
once
in
siena
a
very
agreeable
young
man
and
of
a
worshipful
family
by
name
rinaldo
who
was
passionately
enamored
of
a
very
beautiful
lady
a
neighbour
of
his
and
the
wife
of
a
rich
man
and
flattered
himself
that
could
he
but
find
means
to
speak
with
her
unsuspected
he
might
avail
to
have
of
her
all
that
he
should
desire
seeing
none
other
way
and
the
lady
being
great
with
child
he
bethought
himself
to
become
her
gossip
and
accordingly
clapping
up
an
acquaintance
with
her
husband
he
offered
him
on
such
wise
as
appeared
to
him
most
seemly
to
be
godfather
to
his
child
his
offer
was
accepted
and
he
being
now
become
madam
agnesa
gossip
and
having
a
somewhat
more
colourable
excuse
for
speaking
with
her
he
took
courage
and
gave
her
in
so
many
words
to
know
that
of
his
intent
which
she
had
indeed
long
before
gathered
from
his
looks
but
little
did
this
profit
him
although
the
lady
was
nothing
displeased
to
have
heard
him
not
long
after
whatever
might
have
been
the
reason
it
came
to
pass
that
rinaldo
turned
friar
and
whether
or
not
he
found
the
pasturage
to
his
liking
he
persevered
in
that
way
of
life
and
albeit
in
the
days
of
his
becoming
a
monk
he
had
for
awhile
laid
on
one
side
the
love
he
bore
his
gossip
together
with
sundry
other
vanities
of
his
yet
in
process
of
time
without
quitting
the
monk
habit
he
resumed
them
and
began
to
delight
in
making
a
show
and
wearing
fine
stuffs
and
being
dainty
and
elegant
in
all
his
fashions
and
making
canzonets
and
sonnets
and
ballads
and
in
singing
and
all
manner
other
things
of
the
like
sort
but
what
say
i
of
our
fra
rinaldo
of
whom
we
speak
what
monks
are
there
that
do
not
thus
alack
shame
that
they
are
of
the
corrupt
world
they
blush
not
to
appear
fat
and
ruddy
in
the
face
dainty
in
their
garb
and
in
all
that
pertaineth
unto
them
and
strut
along
not
like
doves
but
like
very
with
crest
erect
and
breast
puffed
out
and
what
is
worse
to
say
nothing
of
having
their
cells
full
of
gallipots
crammed
with
electuaries
and
unguents
of
boxes
full
of
various
confections
of
phials
and
flagons
of
distilled
waters
and
oils
of
pitchers
brimming
with
malmsey
and
cyprus
and
other
wines
of
price
insomuch
that
they
seem
to
the
beholder
not
friars
cells
but
rather
apothecaries
or
shops
they
think
no
shame
that
folk
should
know
them
to
be
gouty
conceiving
that
others
see
not
nor
know
that
strict
fasting
coarse
viands
and
spare
and
sober
living
make
men
lean
and
slender
and
for
the
most
part
sound
of
body
and
that
if
indeed
some
sicken
thereof
at
least
they
sicken
not
of
the
gout
whereto
it
is
used
to
give
for
medicine
chastity
and
everything
else
that
pertaineth
to
the
natural
way
of
living
of
an
honest
friar
yet
they
persuade
themselves
that
others
know
not
that
let
alone
the
scant
and
sober
living
long
vigils
praying
and
discipline
should
make
men
pale
and
mortified
and
that
neither
dominic
nor
francis
far
from
having
four
gowns
for
one
clad
themselves
in
cloth
dyed
in
grain
nor
in
other
fine

the
discarded
vanities
aforesaid
fra
rinaldo
then
having
returned
to
his
former
appetites
began
to
pay
frequent
visits
to
his
gossip
and
waxing
in
assurance
proceeded
to
solicit
her
with
more
than
his
former
instancy
to
that
which
he
desired
of
her
the
good
lady
seeing
herself
hard
pressed
and
fra
rinaldo
seeming
to
her
belike
goodlier
than
she
had
thought
him
aforetime
being
one
day
sore
importuned
of
him
had
recourse
to
that
argument
which
all
women
use
who
have
a
mind
to
yield
that
which
is
asked
of
them
and
said
now
fra
rinaldo
do
monks
such
things
answered
he
as
i
shall
have
this
gown
off
my
back
and
i
can
put
it
off
mighty
easily
i
shall
appear
to
you
a
man
fashioned
like
other
men
and
not
a
monk
the
lady
pulled
a
demure
face
and
said
wretched
me
you
are
my
gossip
how
can
i
do
this
it
were
sadly
ill
and
i
have
heard
many
a
time
that
it
is
a
very
great
sin
but
certes
were
it
not
for
this
i
would
do
that
which
you
wish
quoth
fra
rinaldo
are
a
simpleton
if
you
forbear
for
this
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
not
a
sin
but
god
pardoneth
greater
than
this
to
whoso
repenteth
but
tell
me
who
is
more
akin
to
your
child
i
who
held
him
at
baptism
or
your
husband
who
begat
him
husband
is
more
akin
to
him
answered
the
lady
whereupon
say
sooth
rejoined
the
friar
doth
not
your
husband
lie
with
you
doth
he
replied
she
said
fra
rinaldo
who
am
less
akin
to
your
child
than
is
your
husband
may
lie
with
you
even
as
doth
he
the
lady
who
knew
no
logic
and
needed
little
persuasion
either
believed
or
made
a
show
of
believing
that
the
friar
spoke
the
truth
and
answered
might
avail
to
answer
your
learned
words
and
after
notwithstanding
the
gossipship
she
resigned
herself
to
do
his
pleasure
nor
did
they
content
themselves
with
one
bout
but
foregathered
many
and
many
a
time
having
the
more
commodity
thereof
under
cover
of
the
gossipship
for
that
there
was
less
suspicion
but
once
amongst
other
times
it
befell
that
fra
rinaldo
coming
to
the
lady
house
and
finding
none
with
her
but
a
little
maid
of
hers
who
was
very
pretty
and
agreeable
despatched
his
comrade
with
the
latter
to
the
to
teach
her
her
paternoster
and
entered
with
the
lady
who
had
her
child
in
her
hand
into
her
bedchamber
where
they
locked
themselves
in
and
fell
to
taking
their
pleasure
upon
a
daybed
that
was
there
as
they
were
thus
engaged
it
chanced
that
the
husband
came
home
and
making
for
the
unperceived
of
any
knocked
and
called
to
the
lady
who
hearing
this
said
to
the
friar
am
a
dead
woman
for
here
is
my
husband
and
now
he
will
certainly
perceive
what
is
the
reason
of
our
familiarity
now
rinaldo
was
stripped
to
his
waistcoat
to
wit
he
had
put
off
his
gown
and
his
scapulary
and
hearing
this
answered
say
sooth
were
i
but
dressed
there
might
be
some
means
but
if
you
open
to
him
and
he
find
me
thus
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
us
the
lady
seized
with
a
sudden
idea
said
dress
yourself
and
when
you
are
dressed
take
your
godchild
in
your
arms
and
hearken
well
to
that
which
i
shall
say
to
him
so
your
words
may
after
accord
with
mine
and
leave
me
do
then
to
the
good
man
who
had
not
yet
left
knocking
come
to
thee
quoth
she
and
rising
opened
the
and
said
with
a
good
countenance
mine
i
must
tell
thee
that
fra
rinaldo
our
gossip
is
come
hither
and
it
was
god
sent
him
to
us
for
certes
but
for
his
coming
we
should
have
lost
our
child
the
good
simple
man
hearing
this
was
like
to
swoon
and
said
so
husband
mine
answered
agnesa
took
him
but
now
of
a
sudden
a
that
methought
he
was
dead
and
i
knew
not
what
to
do
or
say
but
just
then
fra
rinaldo
our
gossip
came
in
and
taking
him
in
his
arms
said
gossip
these
be
worms
he
hath
in
his
body
the
which
draw
near
to
his
heart
and
would
infallibly
kill
him
but
have
no
fear
for
i
will
conjure
them
and
make
them
all
die
and
ere
i
go
hence
you
shall
see
the
child
whole
again
as
ever
you
saw
him
and
for
that
we
had
need
of
thee
to
repeat
certain
orisons
and
that
the
maid
could
not
find
thee
he
caused
his
comrade
say
them
in
the
highest
room
of
our
house
whilst
he
and
i
came
hither
and
locked
ourselves
in
so
none
should
hinder
us
for
that
none
other
than
the
child
mother
might
be
present
at
such
an
office
indeed
he
hath
the
child
yet
in
his
arms
and
methinketh
he
waiteth
but
for
his
comrade
to
have
made
an
end
of
saying
the
orisons
and
it
will
be
done
for
that
the
boy
is
already
altogether
restored
to
himself
the
good
simple
man
believing
all
this
was
so
straitened
with
concern
for
his
child
that
it
never
entered
his
mind
to
suspect
the
cheat
put
upon
him
by
his
wife
but
heaving
a
great
sigh
he
said
will
go
see
him
answered
she
wouldst
mar
that
which
hath
been
done
wait
i
will
go
see
an
thou
mayst
come
in
and
call
thee
meanwhile
fra
rinaldo
who
had
heard
everything
and
had
dressed
himself
at
his
leisure
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
called
out
as
soon
as
he
had
ordered
matters
to
his
mind
saying
gossip
hear
i
not
my
gossip
your
husband
there
sir
answered
the
simpleton
whereupon
said
the
other
hither
the
cuckold
went
to
him
and
fra
rinaldo
said
to
him
your
son
by
the
grace
of
god
whole
and
well
whereas
i
deemed
but
now
you
would
not
see
him
alive
at
vespers
and
look
you
let
make
a
waxen
image
of
his
bigness
and
set
it
up
to
the
praise
and
glory
of
god
before
the
statue
of
our
lord
ambrose
through
whose
intercession
he
hath
vouchsafed
to
restore
him
unto
you
the
child
seeing
his
father
ran
to
him
and
caressed
him
as
little
children
used
to
do
whilst
the
latter
taking
him
weeping
in
his
arms
no
otherwise
than
as
he
had
brought
him
forth
of
the
grave
fell
to
kissing
him
and
returning
thanks
to
his
gossip
for
that
he
had
made
him

had
by

more

had
given
her

he
had
from
a
nun
and
made

devotee
hearing
the

softly
betaken
himself
to
a
place
whence
he
could
himself
unseen
both
see
and
hear
what
should
betide
and
presently
seeing
that
all
had
passed
off
well
came
down
and
entering
the
chamber
said
rinaldo
i
have
despatched
all
four
of
the
orisons

you
bade

entertained
his

the

with
that
whereof
they
had
more
need
than
of
aught
else
then
attending
them
to
the
door
he
commended
them
to

make

syn

there
was
once
then
in
arezzo
a
rich
man
called
tofano
and
he
was
given
to
wife
a
very
fair
lady
by
name
madam
ghita
of
whom
without
knowing
why
he
quickly
waxed
jealous
the
lady
becoming
aware
of
this
was
despited
thereat
and
questioned
him
once
and
again
of
the
reason
of
his
jealousy
but
he
was
able
to
assign
her
none
save
such
as
were
general
and
naught
wherefore
it
occurred
to
her
mind
to
cause
him
die
of
the
disease
whereof
he
stood
without
reason
in
fear
accordingly
perceiving
that
a
young
man
who
was
much
to
her
taste
sighed
for
her
she
proceeded
discreetly
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
and
things
being
so
far
advanced
between
them
that
there
lacked
but
with
deeds
to
give
effect
to
words
she
cast
about
for
a
means
of
bringing
this
also
to
pass
wherefore
having
already
remarked
amongst
her
husband
other
ill
usances
that
he
delighted
in
drinking
she
began
not
only
to
commend
this
to
him
but
would
often
artfully
incite
him
thereto
this
became
so
much
his
wont
that
well
nigh
whensoever
it
pleased
her
she
led
him
to
drink
even
to
intoxication
and
putting
him
to
bed
whenas
she
saw
him
well
drunken
she
a
first
time
foregathered
with
her
lover
with
whom
many
a
time
thereafter
she
continued
to
do
so
in
all
security
indeed
she
grew
to
put
such
trust
in
her
husband
drunkenness
that
not
only
did
she
make
bold
to
bring
her
gallant
into
the
house
but
went
whiles
to
pass
a
great
part
of
the
night
with
him
in
his
own
house
which
was
not
very
far
distant
the
enamoured
lady
continuing
on
this
wise
it
befell
that
the
wretched
husband
came
to
perceive
that
she
whilst
encouraging
him
to
drink
natheless
herself
drank
never
wherefore
suspicion
took
him
that
it
might
be
as
in
truth
it
was
to
wit
that
she
made
him
drunken
so
she
might
after
do
her
pleasure
what
while
he
slept
and
wishing
to
make
proof
of
this
an
it
were
so
he
one
evening
not
having
drunken
that
day
feigned
himself
both
in
words
and
fashions
the
drunkenest
man
that
was
aye
the
lady
believing
this
and
judging
that
he
needed
no
more
drink
put
him
to
bed
in
all
haste
and
this
done
betook
herself
as
she
was
used
to
do
whiles
to
the
house
of
her
lover
where
she
abode
till
midnight
as
for
tofano
no
sooner
did
he
know
the
lady
to
have
left
the
house
than
he
straightway
arose
and
going
to
the
doors
locked
them
from
within
after
which
he
posted
himself
at
the
window
so
he
might
see
her
return
and
show
her
that
he
had
gotten
wind
of
her
fashions
and
there
he
abode
till
such
time
as
she
came
back
the
lady
returning
home
and
finding
herself
locked
out
was
beyond
measure
woeful
and
began
to
essay
an
she
might

to
open
the
door
by
force
which
after
tofano
had
awhile
suffered

fell
to

him
for
the
love

that
it
would
please
him
open
to
her
for
that
she
came
not
whence
he
supposed

from
keeping
vigil
with
a
of
hers
for
that
the
nights
were
long
and
she
could
not
sleep
them
all
out
nor
watch
at

however
prayers
profited
her
nought

that

was
minded
to
have
all
the

their
shame
whereas
none

seeing
that

at

chid
him
for

abroad

came
thither

took
tofano
and

him
such
a

took

carried
her
off
home
with
them
threatening
tofano
with

the
latter
finding
himself
in
ill
case
and
seeing
that
his
jealousy
had
brought
him
to
a
sorry
pass
for
that
he
still
loved
his
wife
heartily
procured
certain
friends
to
intercede
for
him
and
so
wrought
that
he
made
his
peace
with
the
lady
and
had
her
home
again
with
him
promising
her
that
he
would
never
be
jealous
again

he
gave
her
leave
to
do
her
every
pleasure
provided
she
wrought
so
discreetly
that
he
should
know
nothing
thereof
and
on
this
wise
like
a
churl

made
peace
after
suffering

of
a

husband
accounting

i
do
all
that
their
wives
do
unto
such
particularly
whenas
they
are
jealous
without
cause
to
be
well
done
and
holding
that
if
the
makers
of
the
laws
had
considered
everything
they
should
have
appointed
none
other
penalty
unto
women
who
offend
in
this
than
that
which
they
appoint
unto
whoso
offendeth

abide
all
the
week
mewed
up
at
home
occupying
themselves
with
domestic
offices
and
the
occasions
of
their
families
and
households
and
after
they
would
fain
like
every
one
else
have
some
solace
and
some
rest
on
holidays
and
be
at
leisure
to
take
some
diversion
even
as
do
the
tillers
of
the
fields
the
artisans
of
the
towns
and
the
administrators
of
the
laws
according
to
the
example
of
god
himself
who
rested
from
all
his
labours
the
seventh
day
and
to
the
intent
of
the
laws
both
human
and
divine
which
looking
to
the
honour
of
god
and
the
common
weal
of
all
have
distinguished
working
days
from
those
of
repose
but
to
this
jealous
men
will
on
no
wise
consent
nay
those
days
which
are
gladsome
for
all
other
women
they
make
wretcheder
and
more
doleful
than
the
others
to
their
wives
keeping
them
yet
closelier
straitened
and
confined
and
what
a
misery
and
a
languishment
this
is
for
the
poor
creatures
those
only
know
who
have
proved
it
wherefore
to
conclude
i
say
that
what
a
woman
doth
to
a
husband
who
is
jealous
without
cause
should
certes
not
be
condemned
but
rather
commended
there
was
then
in
arimino
a
merchant
very
rich
both
in
lands
and
monies
who
having
to
wife
a
very
fair
lady
became
beyond
measure
jealous
of
her
nor
had
he
other
cause
for
this
save
that
as
he
loved
her
exceedingly
and
held
her
very
fair
and
saw
that
she
studied
with
all
her
might
to
please
him
even
so
he
imagined
that
every
man
loved
her
and
that
she
appeared
fair
to
all
and
eke
that
she
studied
to
please
others
as
she
did
himself
which
was
the
reasoning
of
a
man
of
nought
and
one
of
little
sense
being
grown
thus
jealous
he
kept
such
strict
watch
over
her
and
held
her
in
such
constraint
that
belike
many
there
be
of
those
who
are
condemned
to
capital
punishment
who
are
less
straitly
guarded
of
their
gaolers
for
far
from
being
at
liberty
to
go
to
weddings
or
entertainments
or
to
church
or
indeed
anywise
to
set
foot
without
the
house
she
dared
not
even
stand
at
the
window
nor
look
abroad
on
any
occasion
wherefore
her
life
was
most
wretched
and
she
brooked
this
annoy
with
the
more
impatience
as
she
felt
herself
the
less
to
blame
accordingly
seeing
herself
unjustly
suspected
of
her
husband
she
determined
for
her
own
solacement
to
find
a
means
an
she
but
might
of
doing
on
such
wise
that
he
should
have
reason
for
his
ill
usage
of
her
and
for
that
she
might
not
station
herself
at
the
window
and
so
had
no
opportunity
of
showing
herself
favourable
to
the
suit
of
any
one
who
might
take
note
of
her
as
he
passed
along
her
street
and
pay
his
court
to
her
knowing
that
in
the
adjoining
house
there
was
a
certain
young
man
both
handsome
and
agreeable
she
bethought
herself
to
look
if
there
were
any
hole
in
the
wall
that
parted
the
two
houses
and
therethrough
to
spy
once
and
again
till
such
time
as
she
should
see
the
youth
aforesaid
and
find
an
occasion
of
speaking
with
him
and
bestowing
on
him
her
love
so
he
would
accept
thereof
purposing
if
a
means
could
be
found
to
foregather
with
him
bytimes
and
on
this
wise
while
away
her
sorry
life
till
such
time
as
the
demon
of
jealousy
should
take
leave
of
her
husband
accordingly
she
went
spying
about
the
walls
of
the
house
now
in
one
part
and
now
in
another
whenas
her
husband
was
abroad
and
happened
at
last
upon
a
very
privy
place
where
the
wall
was
somewhat
opened
by
a
fissure
and
looking
therethrough
albeit
she
could
ill
discover
what
was
on
the
other
side
algates
she
perceived
that
the
opening
gave
upon
a
bedchamber
there
and
said
in
herself
this
be
the
chamber
of
filippo
to
wit
the
youth
her
neighbour
were
half
sped
then
causing
secretly
enquire
of
this
by
a
maid
of
hers
who
had
pity
upon
her
she
found
that
the
young
man
did
indeed
sleep
in
that
chamber
all
alone
wherefore
by
dint
of
often
visiting
the
crevice
and
dropping
pebbles
and
such
small
matters
whenas
she
perceived
him
to
be
there
she
wrought
on
such
wise
that
he
came
to
the
opening
to
see
what
was
to
do
whereupon
she
called
to
him
softly
he
knowing
her
voice
answered
her
and
she
profiting
by
the
occasion
discovered
to
him
in
brief
all
her
mind
whereat
the
youth
was
mightily
content
and
made
shift
to
enlarge
the
hole
from
his
side
on
such
wise
that
none
could
perceive
it
and
therethrough
they
many
a
time
bespoke
one
another
and
touched
hands
but
could
go
no
farther
for
the
jealous
vigilance
of
the
husband
after
awhile
the
feast
of
the
nativity
drawing
near
the
lady
told
her
husband
that
an
it
pleased
him
she
would
fain
go
to
church
on
christmas
morning
and
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
as
other
christians
did
quoth
he
what
sin
hast
thou
committed
that
thou
wouldst
confess
answered
the
lady
thou
that
i
am
a
saint
because
thou
keepest
me
mewed
up
thou
must
know
well
enough
that
i
commit
sins
like
all
others
that
live
in
this
world
but
i
will
not
tell
them
to
thee
for
that
thou
art
not
a
priest
the
jealous
wretch
took
suspicion
at
these
words
and
determined
to
seek
to
know
what
sins
she
had
committed
wherefore
having
bethought
himself
of
a
means
whereby
he
might
gain
his
end
he
answered
that
he
was
content
but
that
he
would
have
her
go
to
no
other
church
than
their
parish
chapel
and
that
thither
she
must
go
betimes
in
the
morning
and
confess
herself
either
to
their
chaplain
or
to
such
priest
as
the
latter
should
appoint
her
and
to
none
other
and
presently
return
home
herseemed
she
half
apprehended
his
meaning
but
without
saying
otherwhat
she
answered
that
she
would
do
as
he
said
accordingly
christmas
day
come
the
lady
arose
at
daybreak
and
attiring
herself
repaired
to
the
church
appointed
her
of
her
husband
who
on
his
part
betook
himself
to
the
same
place
and
reached
it
before
her
having
already
taken
order
with
the
chaplain
of
that
which
he
had
a
mind
to
do
he
hastily
donned
one
of
the
latter
gowns
with
a
great
flapped
cowl
such
as
we
see
priests
wear
and
drawing
the
hood
a
little
over
his
face
seated
himself
in
the
choir
the
lady
entering
the
chapel
enquired
for
the
chaplain
who
came
and
hearing
from
her
that
she
would
fain
confess
said
that
he
could
not
hear
her
but
would
send
her
one
of
his
brethren
accordingly
going
away
he
sent
her
the
jealous
man
in
an
ill
hour
for
the
latter
who
came
up
with
a
very
grave
air
and
albeit
the
day
was
not
over
bright
and
he
had
drawn
the
cowl
far
over
his
eyes
knew
not
so
well
to
disguise
himself
but
he
was
readily
recognized
by
the
lady
who
seeing
this
said
in
herself
be
god
from
a
jealous
man
he
is
turned
priest
but
no
matter
i
will
give
him
what
he
goeth
seeking
accordingly
feigning
not
to
know
him
she
seated
herself
at
his
feet
my
lord
jealousy
had
put
some
pebbles
in
his
mouth
to
impede
his
speech
somewhat
so
his
wife
might
not
know
him
by
his
voice
himseeming
he
was
in
every
other
particular
so
thoroughly
disguised
that
he
was
nowise
fearful
of
being
recognized
by
her
to
come
to
the
confession
the
lady
told
him
amongst
other
things
having
first
declared
herself
to
be
married
that
she
was
enamoured
of
a
priest
who
came
every
night
to
lie
with
her
when
the
jealous
man
heard
this
himseemed
he
had
gotten
a
in
the
heart
and
had
not
desire
constrained
him
to
know
more
he
had
abandoned
the
confession
and
gone
away
standing
fast
then
he
asked
the
lady
doth
not
your
husband
lie
with
you
doth
he
sir
replied
she
then
asked
the
jealous
man
the
priest
also
lie
with
you
answered
she
what
art
he
doth
it
i
know
not
but
there
is
not
a
door
in
the
house
so
fast
locked
but
it
openeth
so
soon
as
he
toucheth
it
and
he
telleth
me
that
whenas
he
cometh
to
the
door
of
my
chamber
before
opening
it
he
pronounceth
certain
words
by
virtue
whereof
my
husband
incontinent
falleth
asleep
and
so
soon
as
he
perceiveth
him
to
be
fast
he
openeth
the
door
and
cometh
in
and
lieth
with
me
and
this
never
faileth
quoth
the
mock
priest
this
is
ill
done
and
it
behoveth
you
altogether
to
refrain
therefrom
answered
the
lady
i
could
never
do
that
for
that
i
love
him
too
well
said
the
other
can
not
shrive
you
quoth
she
am
grieved
for
that
but
i
came
not
hither
to
tell
you
lies
an
i
thought
i
could
do
it
i
would
tell
you
so
truth
madam
replied
the
husband
am
concerned
for
you
for
that
i
see
you
lose
your
soul
at
this
game
but
to
do
you
service
i
will
well
to
take
the
pains
of
putting
up
my
special
orisons
to
god
in
your
name
the
which
maybe
shall
profit
you
and
i
will
send
you
bytimes
a
little
clerk
of
mine
to
whom
you
shall
say
if
they
have
profited
you
or
not
and
if
they
have
profited
you
we
will
proceed
farther
answered
the
lady
you
do
send
none
to
me
at
home
for
should
my
husband
come
to
know
of
it
he
is
so
terribly
jealous
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
get
it
out
of
his
head
that
your
messenger
came
hither
for
nought
but
ill
and
i
should
have
no
peace
with
him
this
year
to
come
quoth
the
other
have
no
fear
of
that
for
i
will
certainly
contrive
it
on
such
wise
that
you
shall
never
hear
a
word
of
the
matter
from
him
then
said
she
but
you
can
engage
to
do
that
i
am
content
then
having
made
her
confession
and
gotten
her
penance
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
went
off
to
hear
mass
whilst
the
jealous
man
ill
luck
go
with
him
withdrew
bursting
with
rage
to
put
off
his
priest
habit
and
returned
home
impatient
to
find
a
means
of
surprising
the
priest
with
his
wife
so
he
might
play
the
one
and
the
other
an
ill
turn
footnote
boccaccio
writes
carelessly
for
which
makes
nonsense
of
the
passage
presently
the
lady
came
back
from
church
and
saw
plainly
enough
from
her
husband
looks
that
she
had
given
him
an
ill
christmas
albeit
he
studied
as
most
he
might
to
conceal
that
which
he
had
done
and
what
himseemed
he
had
learned
then
being
inwardly
resolved
to
lie
in
wait
near
the
that
night
and
watch
for
the
priest
coming
he
said
to
the
lady
must
i
sup
and
lie
abroad
wherefore
look
thou
lock
the
fast
as
well
as
that
of
the
midstair
and
that
of
thy
chamber
and
get
thee
to
bed
whenas
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
the
lady
answered
is
well
and
betaking
herself
as
soon
as
she
had
leisure
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
she
made
the
wonted
signal
which
when
filippo
heard
he
came
to
her
forthright
she
told
him
how
she
had
done
that
morning
and
what
her
husband
had
said
to
her
after
dinner
and
added
am
certain
he
will
not
leave
the
house
but
will
set
himself
to
watch
the
door
wherefore
do
thou
find
means
to
come
hither
to
me
by
the
roof
so
we
may
lie
together
the
young
man
was
mightily
rejoiced
at
this
and
answered
leave
me
do
accordingly
the
night
come
the
jealous
man
took
his
arms
and
hid
himself
by
stealth
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
whilst
the
lady
whenas
it
seemed
to
her
time
having
caused
lock
all
the
doors
and
in
particular
that
of
the
midstair
so
he
might
not
avail
to
come
up
summoned
the
young
man
who
came
to
her
from
his
side
by
a
very
privy
way
thereupon
they
went
to
bed
and
gave
themselves
a
good
time
taking
their
pleasure
one
of
the
other
till
daybreak
when
the
young
man
returned
to
his
own
house
meanwhile
the
jealous
man
stood
to
his
arms
well
nigh
all
night
beside
the
sorry
and
supperless
and
dying
of
cold
and
waited
for
the
priest
to
come
till
near
upon
day
when
unable
to
watch
any
longer
he
returned
to
the
ground
floor
room
and
there
fell
asleep
towards
tierce
he
awoke
and
the
street
door
being
now
open
he
made
a
show
of
returning
from
otherwhere
and
went
up
into
his
house
and
dined
a
little
after
he
sent
a
lad
as
he
were
the
priest
clerkling
that
had
confessed
her
to
the
lady
to
ask
if
she
wot
of
were
come
thither
again
she
knew
the
messenger
well
enough
and
answered
that
he
had
not
come
thither
that
night
and
that
if
he
did
thus
he
might
haply
pass
out
of
her
mind
albeit
she
wished
it
not
what
more
should
i
tell
you
the
jealous
man
abode
on
the
watch
night
after
night
looking
to
catch
the
priest
at
his
entering
in
and
the
lady
still
had
a
merry
life
with
her
lover
the
while
at
length
the
cuckold
able
to
contain
himself
no
longer
asked
his
wife
with
an
angry
air
what
she
had
said
to
the
priest
the
morning
she
had
confessed
herself
to
him
she
answered
that
she
would
not
tell
him
for
that
it
was
neither
a
just
thing
nor
a
seemly
whereupon
woman
that
thou
art
cried
he
despite
of
thee
i
know
what
thou
saidst
to
him
and
needs
must
i
know
the
priest
of
whom
thou
art
so
mightily
enamoured
and
who
by
means
of
his
conjurations
lieth
with
thee
every
night
else
will
i
slit
thy
weasand
she
replied
that
it
was
not
true
that
she
was
enamoured
of
any
priest
cried
the
husband
thou
not
thus
and
thus
to
the
priest
who
confessed
thee
and
she
couldst
not
have
reported
it
better
not
to
say
if
he
had
told
it
thee
but
if
thou
hadst
been
present
ay
i
did
tell
him
this
rejoined
the
jealous
man
me
who
is
this
priest
and
that
quickly
the
lady
fell
and
answered
rejoiceth
me
mightily
to
see
a
wise
man
led
by
the
nose
by
a
woman
even
as
one
leadeth
a
ram
by
the
horns
to
the
shambles
albeit
thou
art
no
longer
wise
nor
hast
been
since
the
hour
when
unknowing
why
thou
sufferedst
the
malignant
spirit
of
jealousy
to
enter
thy
breast
and
the
sillier
and
more
besotted
thou
art
so
much
the
less
is
my
glory
thereof
deemest
thou
husband
mine
i
am
as
blind
of
the
eyes
of
the
body
as
thou
of
those
of
the
mind
certes
no
i
perceived
at
first
sight
who
was
the
priest
that
confessed
me
and
know
that
thou
wast
he
but
i
had
it
at
heart
to
give
thee
that
which
thou
wentest
seeking
and
in
sooth
i
have
done
it
wert
thou
as
wise
as
thou
thinkest
to
be
thou
wouldst
not
have
essayed
by
this
means
to
learn
the
secrets
of
thy
good
wife
but
wouldst
without
taking
vain
suspicion
have
recognized
that
which
she
confessed
to
thee
to
be
the
very
truth
without
her
having
sinned
in
aught
i
told
thee
that
i
loved
a
priest
and
wast
not
thou
whom
i
am
much
to
blame
to
love
as
i
do
become
a
priest
i
told
thee
that
no
door
of
my
house
could
abide
locked
whenas
he
had
a
mind
to
lie
with
me
and
what
door
in
the
house
was
ever
kept
against
thee
whenas
thou
wouldst
come
whereas
i
might
be
i
told
thee
that
the
priest
lay
with
me
every
night
and
when
was
it
that
thou
layest
not
with
me
and
whenassoever
thou
sentest
thy
clerk
to
me
which
was
thou
knowest
as
often
as
thou
layest
from
me
i
sent
thee
word
that
the
priest
had
not
been
with
me
what
other
than
a
like
thee
who
has
suffered
thyself
to
be
blinded
by
thy
jealousy
had
failed
to
understand
these
things
thou
hast
abidden
in
the
house
keeping
watch
anights
and
thoughtest
to
have
given
me
to
believe
that
thou
wast
gone
abroad
to
sup
and
sleep
bethink
thee
henceforth
and
become
a
man
again
as
thou
wast
wont
to
be
and
make
not
thyself
a
laughing
stock
to
whoso
knoweth
thy
fashions
as
do
i
and
leave
this
unconscionable
watching
that
thou
keepest
for
i
swear
to
god
that
an
the
fancy
took
me
to
make
thee
wear
the
horns
i
would
engage
haddest
thou
an
hundred
eyes
as
thou
hast
but
two
to
do
my
pleasure
on
such
wise
that
thou
shouldst
not
be
ware
thereof
the
jealous
wretch
who
thought
to
have
very
adroitly
surprised
his
wife
secrets
hearing
this
avouched
himself
befooled
and
without
answering
otherwhat
held
the
lady
for
virtuous
and
discreet
and
whenas
it
behoved
him
to
be
jealous
he
altogether
divested
himself
of
his
jealousy
even
as
he
had
put
it
on
what
time
he
had
no
need
thereof
wherefore
the
discreet
lady
being
in
a
manner
licensed
to
do
her
pleasures
thenceforward
no
longer
caused
her
lover
to
come
to
her
by
the
roof
as
go
the
cats
but
brought
him
in
at
the
door
and
dealing
advisedly
many
a
day
thereafter
gave
herself
a
good
time
and
led
a
merry
life
with
him
the
sixth
story
day
the
seventh
madam
isabella
being
in
company
with
leonetto
her
lover
is
visited
by
one
messer
lambertuccio
of
whom
she
is
beloved
her
husband
returning
unexpected
she
sendeth
lambertuccio
forth
of
the
house
whinger
in
hand
and
the
husband
after
escorteth
leonetto
home
the
company
were
pleased
with
fiammetta
story
all
affirming
that
the
lady
had
done
excellently
well
and
as
it
behoved
unto
such
a
brute
of
a
man
and
after
it
was
ended
the
king
bade
pampinea
follow
on
who
proceeded
to
say
there
are
many
who
speaking
ignorantly
avouch
that
love
bereaveth
folk
of
their
senses
and
causeth
whoso
loveth
to
become
witless
meseemeth
this
is
a
foolish
opinion
as
hath
indeed
been
well
enough
shown
by
the
things
already
related
and
i
purpose
yet
again
to
demonstrate
it
in
our
city
which
aboundeth
in
all
good
things
there
was
once
a
young
lady
both
gently
born
and
very
fair
who
was
the
wife
of
a
very
worthy
and
notable
gentleman
and
as
it
happeneth
often
that
folk
can
not
for
ever
brook
one
same
food
but
desire
bytimes
to
vary
their
diet
this
lady
her
husband
not
altogether
satisfying
her
became
enamoured
of
a
young
man
called
leonetto
and
very
well
bred
and
agreeable
for
all
he
was
of
no
great
extraction
he
on
like
wise
fell
in
love
with
her
and
as
you
know
that
seldom
doth
that
which
both
parties
desire
abide
without
effect
it
was
no
great
while
before
accomplishment
was
given
to
their
loves
now
it
chanced
that
she
being
a
fair
and
engaging
lady
a
gentleman
called
messer
lambertuccio
became
sore
enamoured
of
her
whom
for
that
he
seemed
to
her
a
disagreeable
man
and
a
tiresome
she
could
not
for
aught
in
the
world
bring
herself
to
love
however
after
soliciting
her
amain
with
messages
and
it
availing
him
nought
he
sent
to
her
threatening
her
for
that
he
was
a
notable
man
to
dishonour
her
an
she
did
not
his
pleasure
wherefore
she
fearful
and
knowing
his
character
submitted
herself
to
do
his
will
it
chanced
one
day
that
the
lady
whose
name
was
madam
isabella
being
gone
as
is
our
custom
in
to
abide
at
a
very
goodly
estate
she
had
in
the
country
and
her
husband
having
ridden
somewhither
to
pass
some
days
abroad
she
sent
for
leonetto
to
come
and
be
with
her
whereat
he
was
mightily
rejoiced
and
betook
himself
thither
incontinent
meanwhile
messer
lambertuccio
hearing
that
her
husband
was
gone
abroad
took
horse
and
repairing
all
alone
to
her
house
knocked
at
the
door
the
lady
seeing
him
came
straight
to
her
mistress
who
was
closeted
with
leonetto
and
called
to
her
saying
messer
lambertuccio
is
below
all
alone
the
lady
hearing
this
was
the
woefullest
woman
in
the
world
but
as
she
stood
in
great
fear
of
messer
lambertuccio
she
besought
leonetto
not
to
take
it
ill
to
hide
himself
awhile
behind
the
curtains
of
her
bed
till
such
time
as
the
other
should
be
gone
accordingly
leonetto
who
feared
him
no
less
than
did
the
lady
hid
himself
there
and
she
bade
the
maid
go
open
to
messer
lambertuccio
which
being
done
he
lighted
down
in
the
courtyard
and
making
his
palfrey
fast
to
a
staple
there
went
up
into
the
house
the
lady
put
on
a
cheerful
countenance
and
coming
to
the
head
of
the
stair
received
him
with
as
good
a
grace
as
she
might
and
asked
him
what
brought
him
thither
whereupon
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
clipped
her
and
kissed
her
saying
soul
i
understood
that
your
husband
was
abroad
and
am
come
accordingly
to
be
with
you
awhile
after
these
words
they
entered
a
bedchamber
where
they
locked
themselves
in
and
messer
lambertuccio
fell
to
taking
delight
of
her
as
they
were
thus
engaged
it
befell
altogether
out
of
the
expectation
that
her
husband
returned
whom
when
the
maid
saw
near
the
house
she
ran
in
haste
to
the
lady
chamber
and
said
here
is
my
lord
come
back
methinketh
he
is
already
below
in
the
courtyard
when
the
lady
heard
this
bethinking
her
that
she
had
two
men
in
the
house
and
knowing
that
there
was
no
hiding
messer
lambertuccio
by
reason
of
his
palfrey
which
was
in
the
courtyard
she
gave
herself
up
for
lost
nevertheless
taking
a
sudden
resolution
she
sprang
hastily
down
from
the
bed
and
said
to
messer
lambertuccio
an
you
wish
me
anywise
well
and
would
save
me
from
death
do
that
which
i
shall
bid
you
take
your
hanger
naked
in
your
hand
and
go
down
the
stair
with
an
angry
air
and
all
disordered
and
begone
saying
i
vow
to
god
that
i
will
take
him
elsewhere
and
should
my
husband
offer
to
detain
you
or
question
you
of
aught
do
you
say
no
otherwhat
than
that
which
i
have
told
you
but
take
horse
and
look
you
abide
not
with
him
on
any
account
the
gentleman
answered
that
he
would
well
and
accordingly
drawing
his
hanger
he
did
as
she
had
enjoined
him
with
a
face
all
afire
what
with
the
swink
he
had
furnished
and
with
anger
at
the
husband
return
the
latter
was
by
this
dismounted
in
the
courtyard
and
marvelled
to
see
the
palfrey
there
then
offering
to
go
up
into
the
house
he
saw
messer
lambertuccio
come
down
and
wondering
both
at
his
words
and
his
air
said
is
this
sir
messer
lambertuccio
putting
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
mounting
to
horse
said
nought
but
body
i
shall
find
him
again
otherwhere
and
made
off
the
gentleman
going
up
found
his
wife
at
the
stairhead
all
disordered
and
fearful
and
said
to
her
is
all
this
whom
goeth
messer
lambertuccio
threatening
thus
in
such
a
fury
the
lady
withdrawing
towards
the
chamber
where
leonetto
was
so
he
might
hear
her
answered
never
had
i
the
like
of
this
fright
there
came
fleeing
hither
but
now
a
young
man
whom
i
know
not
followed
by
messer
lambertuccio
hanger
in
hand
and
finding
by
chance
the
door
of
this
chamber
open
said
to
me
all
trembling
for
god
sake
madam
help
me
that
i
be
not
slain
in
your
arms
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
was
about
to
question
him
who
he
was
and
what
ailed
him
when
behold
in
rushed
messer
lambertuccio
saying
where
art
thou
traitor
i
set
myself
before
the
and
hindered
him
from
entering
and
he
was
in
so
far
courteous
that
after
many
words
seeing
it
pleased
me
not
that
he
should
enter
there
he
went
his
way
down
as
you
have
seen
quoth
the
husband
thou
didst
well
it
were
too
great
a
reproach
to
us
had
a
man
been
slain
in
our
house
and
messer
lambertuccio
did
exceeding
unmannerly
to
follow
a
person
who
had
taken
refuge
here
then
he
asked
where
the
young
man
was
and
the
lady
answered
sir
i
know
not
where
he
hath
hidden
himself
then
said
the
husband
art
thou
come
forth
in
safety
whereupon
leonetto
who
had
heard
everything
came
forth
all
trembling
for
fear
as
indeed
he
had
had
a
great
fright
of
the
place
where
he
had
hidden
himself
and
the
gentleman
said
to
him
hast
thou
to
do
with
messer
lambertuccio
answered
he
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
him
wherefore
methinketh
assuredly
he
is
either
not
in
his
right
wits
or
he
hath
mistaken
me
for
another
for
that
no
sooner
did
he
set
eyes
on
me
in
the
road
not
far
from
this
house
than
he
forthright
clapped
his
hand
to
his
hanger
and
said
traitor
thou
art
a
dead
man
i
stayed
not
to
ask
why
but
took
to
my
heels
as
best
i
might
and
made
my
way
hither
where
thanks
to
god
and
to
this
gentlewoman
i
have
escaped
quoth
the
husband
to
have
no
fears
i
will
bring
thee
to
thine
own
house
safe
and
sound
and
thou
canst
after
seek
out
what
thou
hast
to
do
with
him
accordingly
when
they
had
supped
he
mounted
him
and
carrying
him
back
to
florence
left
him
in
his
own
house
as
for
leonetto
that
same
evening
according
as
he
had
been
lessoned
of
the
lady
he
privily
bespoke
messer
lambertuccio
and
took
such
order
with
him
albeit
there
was
much
talk
of
the
matter
thereafterward
the
husband
never
for
all
that
became
aware
of
the
cheat
that
had
been
put
on
him
by
his
wife
the
seventh
story
day
the
seventh
lodovico
discovereth
to
madam
beatrice
the
love
he
beareth
her
whereupon
she
sendeth
egano
her
husband
into
the
garden
in
her
own
favour
and
lieth
meanwhile
with
lodovico
who
presently
arising
goeth
and
cudgelleth
egano
in
the
garden
madam
isabella
presence
of
mind
as
related
by
pampinea
was
held
admirable
by
all
the
company
but
whilst
they
yet
marvelled
thereat
filomena
whom
the
king
had
appointed
to
follow
on
said
lovesome
ladies
and
i
mistake
not
methinketh
i
can
tell
you
no
less
goodly
a
story
on
the
same
subject
and
that
forthright
you
must
know
then
that
there
was
once
in
paris
a
florentine
gentleman
who
was
for
poverty
turned
merchant
and
had
thriven
so
well
in
commerce
that
he
was
grown
thereby
very
rich
he
had
by
his
lady
one
only
son
whom
he
had
named
lodovico
and
for
that
he
might
concern
himself
with
his
father
nobility
and
not
with
trade
he
had
willed
not
to
place
him
in
any
warehouse
but
had
sent
him
to
be
with
other
gentlemen
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
france
where
he
learned
store
of
goodly
manners
and
other
fine
things
during
his
sojourn
there
it
befell
that
certain
gentlemen
who
were
returned
from
visiting
the
holy
sepulchre
coming
in
upon
a
conversation
between
certain
young
men
of
whom
lodovico
was
one
and
hearing
them
discourse
among
themselves
of
the
fair
ladies
of
france
and
england
and
other
parts
of
the
world
one
of
them
began
to
say
that
assuredly
in
all
the
lands
he
had
traversed
and
for
all
the
ladies
he
had
seen
he
had
never
beheld
the
like
for
beauty
of
madam
beatrice
the
wife
of
messer
egano
de
gulluzzi
of
bologna
to
which
all
his
companions
who
had
with
him
seen
her
at
bologna
agreed
lodovico
who
had
never
yet
been
enamoured
of
any
woman
hearkening
to
this
was
fired
with
such
longing
to
see
her
that
he
could
hold
his
thought
to
nothing
else
and
being
altogether
resolved
to
journey
to
bologna
for
that
purpose
and
there
if
she
pleased
him
to
abide
awhile
he
feigned
to
his
father
that
he
had
a
mind
to
go
visit
the
holy
sepulchre
the
which
with
great
difficulty
he
obtained
of
him
accordingly
taking
the
name
of
anichino
he
set
out
for
bologna
and
on
the
day
following
his
arrival
as
fortune
would
have
it
he
saw
the
lady
in
question
at
an
entertainment
where
she
seemed
to
him
fairer
far
than
he
had
imagined
her
wherefore
falling
most
ardently
enamoured
of
her
he
resolved
never
to
depart
bologna
till
he
should
have
gained
her
love
then
devising
in
himself
what
course
he
should
take
to
this
end
he
bethought
himself
leaving
be
all
other
means
that
an
he
might
but
avail
to
become
one
of
her
husband
servants
whereof
he
entertained
many
he
might
peradventure
compass
that
which
he
desired
accordingly
having
sold
his
horses
and
disposed
as
best
might
be
of
his
servants
bidding
them
make
a
show
of
knowing
him
not
he
entered
into
discourse
with
his
host
and
told
him
that
he
would
fain
engage
for
a
servant
with
some
gentleman
of
condition
could
such
an
one
be
found
quoth
the
host
art
the
right
to
please
a
gentleman
of
this
city
by
name
egano
who
keepeth
many
and
will
have
them
all
well
looking
as
thou
art
i
will
bespeak
him
of
the
matter
as
he
said
so
he
did
and
ere
he
took
leave
of
egano
he
had
brought
anichino
to
an
accord
with
him
to
the
exceeding
satisfaction
of
the
latter
who
abiding
with
egano
and
having
abundant
opportunity
of
seeing
his
lady
often
proceeded
to
serve
him
so
well
and
so
much
to
his
liking
that
he
set
such
store
by
him
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
him
and
committed
to
him
the
governance
not
of
himself
alone
but
of
all
his
affairs
it
chanced
one
day
that
egano
being
gone
and
having
left
anichino
at
home
madam
beatrice
who
was
not
yet
become
aware
of
his
love
for
her
albeit
considering
him
and
his
fashions
she
had
ofttimes
much
commended
him
to
herself
and
he
pleased
her
fell
to
playing
chess
with
him
and
he
desiring
to
please
her
very
adroitly
contrived
to
let
himself
be
beaten
whereat
the
lady
was
marvellously
rejoiced
presently
all
her
women
having
gone
away
from
seeing
them
play
and
left
them
playing
alone
anichino
heaved
a
great
sigh
whereupon
she
looked
at
him
and
said
aileth
thee
anichino
doth
it
irk
thee
that
i
should
beat
thee
answered
he
far
greater
thing
than
that
was
the
cause
of
my
sighing
quoth
the
lady
as
thou
wishest
me
well
tell
it
me
when
anichino
heard
himself
conjured
thou
wishest
me
well
by
her
whom
he
loved
over
all
else
he
heaved
a
sigh
yet
heavier
than
the
first
wherefore
the
lady
besought
him
anew
that
it
would
please
him
tell
her
the
cause
of
his
sighing
replied
anichino
am
sore
fearful
lest
it
displease
you
if
i
tell
it
you
and
moreover
i
misdoubt
me
you
will
tell
it
again
to
others
whereto
rejoined
she
it
will
not
displease
me
and
thou
mayst
be
assured
that
whatsoever
thou
sayest
to
me
i
will
never
tell
to
any
save
whenas
it
shall
please
thee
quoth
he
you
promise
me
this
i
will
tell
it
you
then
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
told
her
who
he
was
and
what
he
had
heard
of
her
and
when
and
how
he
was
become
enamoured
of
her
and
why
he
had
taken
service
with
her
husband
and
after
humbly
besought
her
that
it
would
please
her
have
compassion
on
him
and
comply
with
him
in
that
his
secret
and
so
fervent
desire
and
in
case
she
willed
not
to
do
this
that
she
should
suffer
him
to
love
her
leaving
him
be
in
that
his
then
present
guise
o
singular
blandness
of
the
bolognese
blood
how
art
thou
still
to
be
commended
in
such
circumstance
never
wast
thou
desirous
of
tears
or
sighs
still
wast
thou
compliant
unto
prayers
and
amenable
unto
amorous
desires
had
i
words
worthy
to
commend
thee
my
voice
should
never
weary
of
singing
thy
praises
the
gentle
lady
what
while
anichino
spoke
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
giving
full
credence
to
his
words
received
by
the
prevalence
of
his
prayers
the
love
of
him
with
such
might
into
her
heart
that
she
also
fell
and
presently
answered
my
anichino
be
of
good
courage
neither
presents
nor
promises
nor
solicitations
of
nobleman
or
gentleman
or
other
for
i
have
been
and
am
yet
courted
of
many
have
ever
availed
to
move
my
heart
to
love
any
one
of
them
but
thou
in
this
small
space
of
time
that
thy
words
have
lasted
hast
made
me
far
more
thine
than
mine
own
methinketh
thou
hast
right
well
earned
my
love
wherefore
i
give
it
thee
and
promise
thee
that
i
will
cause
thee
have
enjoyment
thereof
ere
this
next
night
be
altogether
spent
and
that
this
may
have
effect
look
thou
come
to
my
chamber
about
midnight
i
will
leave
the
door
open
thou
knowest
which
side
the
bed
i
lie
do
thou
come
thither
and
if
i
sleep
touch
me
so
i
may
awake
and
i
will
ease
thee
of
this
so
long
desire
that
thou
hast
had
and
that
thou
mayst
believe
this
that
i
say
i
will
give
thee
a
kiss
by
way
of
arles
accordingly
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
kissed
him
amorously
and
he
on
like
wise
kissed
her
these
things
said
he
left
her
and
went
to
do
certain
occasions
of
his
awaiting
with
the
greatest
gladness
in
the
world
the
coming
of
the
night
presently
egano
returned
from
fowling
and
being
weary
betook
himself
to
bed
as
soon
as
he
had
supper
and
after
him
the
lady
who
left
the
open
as
she
had
promised
thither
at
the
appointed
hour
came
anichino
and
softly
entering
the
chamber
shut
the
door
again
from
within
then
going
up
to
the
bed
on
the
side
where
the
lady
lay
he
put
his
hand
to
her
breast
and
found
her
awake
as
soon
as
she
felt
him
come
she
took
his
hand
in
both
her
own
and
held
it
fast
then
turning
herself
about
in
the
bed
she
did
on
such
wise
that
egano
who
was
asleep
awoke
whereupon
quoth
she
to
him
would
not
say
aught
to
thee
yestereve
for
that
meseemed
thou
was
weary
but
tell
me
egano
so
god
save
thee
whom
holdest
thou
thy
best
and
trustiest
servant
and
him
who
most
loveth
thee
of
those
whom
thou
hast
in
the
house
answered
egano
is
this
whereof
thou
askest
me
knowest
thou
it
not
i
have
not
nor
had
aye
any
in
whom
i
so
trusted
and
whom
i
loved
as
i
love
and
trust
in
anichino
but
why
dost
thou
ask
me
thereof
anichino
seeing
egano
awake
and
hearing
talk
of
himself
was
sore
afraid
lest
the
lady
had
a
mind
to
cozen
him
and
offered
again
and
again
to
draw
his
hand
away
so
he
might
begone
but
she
held
it
so
fast
that
he
could
not
win
free
then
said
she
to
egano
will
tell
thee
i
also
believed
till
that
he
was
even
such
as
thou
sayest
and
that
he
was
more
loyal
to
thee
than
any
other
but
he
hath
undeceived
me
for
that
what
while
thou
wentest
he
abode
here
and
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
he
was
not
ashamed
to
solicit
me
to
yield
myself
to
his
pleasures
and
i
so
i
might
make
thee
touch
and
see
this
thing
and
that
it
might
not
behove
me
certify
thee
thereof
with
too
many
proofs
replied
that
i
would
well
and
that
this
very
night
after
midnight
i
would
go
into
our
garden
and
there
await
him
at
the
foot
of
the
pine
now
for
my
part
i
mean
not
to
go
thither
but
thou
an
thou
have
a
mind
to
know
thy
servant
fidelity
thou
mayst
lightly
do
it
by
donning
a
gown
and
a
veil
of
mine
and
going
down
yonder
to
wait
and
see
if
he
will
come
thither
as
i
am
assured
he
will
egano
hearing
this
answered
needs
must
i
go
see
and
rising
donned
one
of
the
lady
gowns
as
best
he
knew
in
the
dark
then
covering
his
head
with
a
veil
he
betook
himself
to
the
garden
and
proceeded
to
await
anichino
at
the
foot
of
the
pine
as
for
the
lady
as
soon
as
she
knew
him
gone
forth
of
the
chamber
she
arose
and
locked
the
door
from
within
whilst
anichino
who
had
had
the
greatest
fright
he
had
ever
known
and
had
enforced
himself
as
most
he
might
to
escape
from
the
lady
hands
cursing
her
and
her
love
and
himself
who
had
trusted
in
her
an
hundred
thousand
times
seeing
this
that
she
had
done
in
the
end
was
the
joyfullest
man
that
was
aye
then
she
having
returned
to
bed
he
at
her
bidding
put
off
his
clothes
and
coming
to
bed
to
her
they
took
delight
and
pleasure
together
a
pretty
while
after
which
herseeming
he
should
not
abide
longer
she
caused
him
arise
and
dress
himself
and
said
to
him
do
thou
take
a
stout
cudgel
and
get
thee
to
the
garden
and
there
feigning
to
have
solicited
me
to
try
me
rate
egano
as
he
were
i
and
ring
me
a
good
peal
of
bells
on
his
back
with
the
cudgel
for
that
thereof
will
ensue
to
us
marvellous
pleasance
and
delight
anichino
accordingly
repaired
to
the
garden
with
a
in
his
hand
and
egano
seeing
him
draw
near
the
pine
rose
up
and
came
to
meet
him
as
he
would
receive
him
with
the
utmost
joy
whereupon
quoth
anichino
wicked
woman
art
thou
then
come
hither
and
thinkest
thou
i
would
do
my
lord
such
a
wrong
a
thousand
times
ill
come
to
thee
then
raising
the
cudgel
he
began
to
lay
on
to
him
egano
hearing
this
and
seeing
the
cudgel
took
to
his
heels
without
saying
a
word
whilst
anichino
still
followed
after
him
saying
to
god
give
thee
an
ill
year
vile
woman
that
thou
art
i
will
certainly
tell
it
to
egano
morning
egano
made
his
way
back
to
the
chamber
as
quickliest
he
might
having
gotten
sundry
good
clouts
and
being
questioned
of
the
lady
if
anichino
had
come
to
the
garden
god
he
had
not
answered
he
that
taking
me
for
thee
he
hath
cudgelled
me
to
a
mummy
and
given
me
the
soundest
rating
that
was
aye
bestowed
upon
lewd
woman
certes
i
marvelled
sore
at
him
that
he
should
have
said
these
words
to
thee
with
intent
to
do
aught
that
might
be
a
shame
to
me
but
for
that
he
saw
thee
so
blithe
and
gamesome
he
had
a
mind
to
try
thee
then
said
the
lady
be
god
that
he
hath
tried
me
with
words
and
thee
with
deeds
methinketh
he
may
say
that
i
suffered
his
words
more
patiently
than
thou
his
deeds
but
since
he
is
so
loyal
to
thee
it
behoveth
thee
hold
him
dear
and
do
him
honour
answered
egano
sayst
sooth
and
reasoning
by
this
he
concluded
that
he
had
the
truest
wife
and
the
trustiest
servant
that
ever
gentleman
had
by
reason
whereof
albeit
both
he
and
the
lady
made
merry
more
than
once
with
anichino
over
this
adventure
the
latter
and
his
mistress
had
leisure
enough
of
that
which
belike
but
for
this
they
would
not
have
had
to
wit
to
do
that
which
afforded
them
pleasance
and
delight
that
while
it
pleased
anichino
abide
with
egano
in
bologna
the
eighth
story
day
the
seventh
a
man
waxeth
jealous
of
his
wife
who
bindeth
a
piece
of
packthread
to
her
great
toe
anights
so
she
may
have
notice
of
her
lover
coming
one
night
her
husband
becometh
aware
of
this
device
and
what
while
he
pursueth
the
lover
the
lady
putteth
another
woman
to
bed
in
her
room
this
latter
the
husband
beateth
and
cutteth
off
her
hair
then
fetcheth
his
wife
brothers
who
finding
his
story
seemingly
untrue
give
him
hard
words
it
seemed
to
them
all
that
madam
beatrice
had
been
extraordinarily
ingenious
in
cozening
her
husband
and
all
agreed
that
fright
must
have
been
very
great
whenas
being
the
while
held
fast
by
the
lady
he
heard
her
say
that
he
had
required
her
of
love
but
the
king
seeing
filomena
silent
turned
to
neifile
and
said
to
her
do
you
tell
whereupon
she
smiling
first
a
little
began
fair
ladies
i
have
a
hard
task
before
me
if
i
desire
to
pleasure
you
with
a
goodly
story
as
those
of
you
have
done
who
have
already
told
but
with
god
aid
i
trust
to
discharge
myself
thereof
well
enough
you
must
know
then
that
there
was
once
in
our
city
a
very
rich
merchant
called
arriguccio
berlinghieri
who
foolishly
thinking
as
merchants
yet
do
every
day
to
ennoble
himself
by
marriage
took
to
wife
a
young
gentlewoman
ill
sorting
with
himself
by
name
madam
sismonda
who
for
that
he
was
much
abroad
and
sojourned
little
with
her
fell
in
love
with
a
young
man
called
ruberto
who
had
long
courted
her
and
clapped
up
a
lover
privacy
with
him
using
belike
discretion
in
her
dealings
with
her
lover
for
that
they
were
supremely
delightsome
to
her
it
chanced
that
whether
arriguccio
scented
aught
of
the
matter
or
how
else
soever
it
happened
the
latter
became
the
most
jealous
man
alive
and
leaving
be
his
going
about
and
all
his
other
concerns
applied
himself
well
nigh
altogether
to
the
keeping
good
watch
over
his
wife
nor
would
he
ever
fall
asleep
except
he
first
felt
her
come
into
the
bed
by
reason
whereof
the
lady
suffered
the
utmost
chagrin
for
that
on
no
wise
might
she
avail
to
be
with
her
ruberto
however
after
pondering
many
devices
for
finding
a
means
to
foregather
with
him
and
being
to
boot
continually
solicited
thereof
by
him
it
presently
occurred
to
her
to
do
on
this
wise
to
wit
having
many
a
time
observed
that
arriguccio
tarried
long
to
fall
asleep
but
after
slept
very
soundly
she
determined
to
cause
ruberto
come
about
midnight
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
to
go
open
to
him
and
abide
with
him
what
while
her
husband
slept
fast
and
that
she
might
know
when
he
should
be
come
she
bethought
herself
to
hang
a
twine
out
of
the
window
of
her
bedchamber
which
looked
upon
the
street
on
such
wise
that
none
might
perceive
it
one
end
whereof
should
well
nigh
reach
the
ground
whilst
she
carried
the
other
end
along
the
floor
of
the
room
to
the
bed
and
hid
it
under
the
clothes
meaning
to
make
it
fast
to
her
great
toe
whenas
she
should
be
abed
accordingly
she
sent
to
acquaint
ruberto
with
this
and
charged
him
when
he
came
to
pull
the
twine
whereupon
if
her
husband
slept
she
would
let
it
go
and
come
to
open
to
him
but
if
he
slept
not
she
would
hold
it
fast
and
draw
it
to
herself
so
he
should
not
wait
the
device
pleased
ruberto
and
going
thither
frequently
he
was
whiles
able
to
foregather
with
her
and
whiles
not
on
this
wise
they
continued
to
do
till
one
night
the
lady
being
asleep
it
chanced
that
her
husband
stretched
out
his
foot
in
bed
and
felt
the
twine
whereupon
he
put
his
hand
to
it
and
finding
it
made
fast
to
his
wife
toe
said
in
himself
should
be
some
trick
and
presently
perceiving
that
the
twine
led
out
of
window
he
held
it
for
certain
accordingly
he
cut
it
softly
from
the
lady
toe
and
making
it
fast
to
his
own
abode
on
the
watch
to
see
what
this
might
mean
he
had
not
waited
long
before
up
came
ruberto
and
pulled
at
the
twine
as
of
his
wont
whereupon
arriguccio
started
up
but
he
not
having
made
the
twine
well
fast
to
his
toe
and
ruberto
pulling
hard
it
came
loose
in
the
latter
hand
whereby
he
understood
that
he
was
to
wait
and
did
so
as
for
arriguccio
he
arose
in
haste
and
taking
his
arms
ran
to
the
door
to
see
who
this
might
be
and
do
him
a
mischief
for
albeit
a
merchant
he
was
a
stout
fellow
and
a
strong
when
he
came
to
the
door
he
opened
it
not
softly
as
the
lady
was
used
to
do
which
when
ruberto
who
was
await
observed
he
guessed
how
the
case
stood
to
wit
that
it
was
arriguccio
who
opened
the
door
and
accordingly
made
off
in
haste
and
the
other
after
him
at
last
having
fled
a
great
way
and
arriguccio
stinting
not
from
following
him
ruberto
being
also
armed
drew
his
sword
and
turned
upon
his
pursuer
whereupon
they
fell
to
blows
the
one
attacking
and
the
other
defending
himself
meanwhile
the
lady
awaking
as
arriguccio
opened
the
and
finding
the
twine
cut
from
her
toe
knew
incontinent
that
her
device
was
discovered
whereupon
perceiving
that
her
husband
had
run
after
her
lover
she
arose
in
haste
and
foreseeing
what
might
happen
called
her
maid
who
knew
all
and
conjured
her
to
such
purpose
that
she
prevailed
with
her
to
take
her
own
place
in
the
bed
beseeching
her
patiently
to
endure
without
discovering
herself
whatsoever
buffets
arriguccio
might
deal
her
for
that
she
would
requite
her
therefor
on
such
wise
that
she
should
have
no
cause
to
complain
after
which
she
did
out
the
light
that
burnt
in
the
chamber
and
going
forth
thereof
hid
herself
in
another
part
of
the
house
and
there
began
to
await
what
should
betide
meanwhile
the
people
of
the
quarter
aroused
by
the
noise
of
the
affray
between
arriguccio
and
ruberto
arose
and
fell
at
them
whereupon
the
husband
fearing
to
be
known
let
the
youth
go
without
having
availed
to
learn
who
he
was
or
to
do
him
any
hurt
and
returned
to
his
house
full
of
rage
and
despite
there
coming
into
the
chamber
he
cried
out
angrily
saying
art
thou
vile
woman
thou
hast
done
out
the
light
so
i
may
not
find
thee
but
thou
art
mistaken
then
coming
to
the
bedside
he
seized
upon
the
maid
thinking
to
take
his
wife
and
laid
on
to
her
so
lustily
with
cuffs
and
kicks
as
long
as
he
could
wag
his
hands
and
feet
that
he
bruised
all
her
face
ending
by
cutting
off
her
hair
still
giving
her
the
while
the
hardest
words
that
were
ever
said
to
worthless
woman
the
maid
wept
sore
as
indeed
she
had
good
cause
to
do
and
albeit
she
said
whiles
mercy
for
god
sake
and
no
more
her
voice
was
so
broken
with
sobs
and
arriguccio
was
so
hindered
with
his
rage
that
he
never
discerned
it
to
be
that
of
another
woman
than
his
wife
having
then
as
we
have
said
beaten
her
to
good
purpose
and
cut
off
her
hair
he
said
to
her
woman
that
thou
art
i
mean
not
to
touch
thee
otherwise
but
shall
now
go
fetch
thy
brothers
and
acquaint
them
with
thy
fine
doings
and
after
bid
them
come
for
thee
and
deal
with
thee
as
they
shall
deem
may
do
them
honour
and
carry
thee
away
for
assuredly
in
this
house
thou
shalt
abide
no
longer
so
saying
he
departed
the
chamber
and
locking
the
door
from
without
went
away
all
alone
as
soon
as
madam
sismonda
who
had
heard
all
was
certified
of
her
husband
departure
she
opened
the
door
and
rekindling
the
light
found
her
maid
all
bruised
and
weeping
sore
whereupon
she
comforted
her
as
best
she
might
and
carried
her
back
to
her
own
chamber
where
she
after
caused
privily
tend
her
and
care
for
her
and
so
rewarded
her
of
arriguccio
own
monies
that
she
avouched
herself
content
no
sooner
had
she
done
this
than
she
hastened
to
make
the
bed
in
her
own
chamber
and
all
restablished
it
and
set
it
in
such
order
as
if
none
had
lain
there
that
night
after
which
she
dressed
and
tired
herself
as
if
she
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
then
lighting
a
lamp
she
took
her
clothes
and
seated
herself
at
the
stairhead
where
she
proceeded
to
sew
and
await
the
issue
of
the
affair
meanwhile
arriguccio
betook
himself
in
all
haste
to
the
house
of
his
wife
brothers
and
there
knocked
so
long
and
so
loudly
that
he
was
heard
and
it
was
opened
to
him
the
lady
three
brothers
and
her
mother
hearing
that
it
was
arriguccio
rose
all
and
letting
kindle
lights
came
to
him
and
asked
what
he
went
seeking
at
that
hour
and
alone
whereupon
beginning
from
the
twine
he
had
found
tied
to
toe
he
recounted
to
them
all
that
he
had
discovered
and
done
and
to
give
them
entire
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
story
he
put
into
their
hands
the
hair
he
thought
to
have
cut
from
his
wife
head
ending
by
requiring
them
to
come
for
her
and
do
with
her
that
which
they
should
judge
pertinent
to
their
honour
for
that
he
meant
to
keep
her
no
longer
in
his
house
the
lady
brothers
hearing
this
and
holding
it
for
certain
were
sore
incensed
against
her
and
letting
kindle
torches
set
out
to
accompany
arriguccio
to
his
house
meaning
to
do
her
a
mischief
which
their
mother
seeing
she
followed
after
them
weeping
and
entreating
now
the
one
now
the
other
not
to
be
in
such
haste
to
believe
these
things
of
their
sister
without
seeing
or
knowing
more
of
the
matter
for
that
her
husband
might
have
been
angered
with
her
for
some
other
cause
and
have
maltreated
her
and
might
now
allege
this
in
his
own
excuse
adding
that
she
marvelled
exceedingly
how
this
whereof
he
accused
her
could
have
happened
for
that
she
knew
her
daughter
well
as
having
reared
her
from
a
little
child
with
many
other
words
to
the
like
purpose
when
they
came
to
arriguccio
house
they
entered
and
proceeded
to
mount
the
stair
whereupon
madam
sismonda
hearing
them
come
said
is
there
to
which
one
of
her
brothers
answered
shalt
soon
know
who
it
is
vile
woman
that
thou
art
aid
us
cried
she
meaneth
this
then
rising
to
her
feet
mine
quoth
she
are
welcome
but
what
go
you
all
three
seeking
at
this
hour
the
brothers
seeing
her
seated
sewing
with
no
sign
of
beating
on
her
face
whereas
arriguccio
avouched
that
he
had
beaten
her
to
a
mummy
began
to
marvel
and
curbing
the
violence
of
their
anger
demanded
of
her
how
that
had
been
whereof
arriguccio
accused
her
threatening
her
sore
and
she
told
them
not
all
quoth
she
know
not
what
you
would
have
me
say
nor
of
what
arriguccio
can
have
complained
to
you
of
me
arriguccio
seeing
her
thus
eyed
her
as
if
he
had
lost
his
wits
remembering
that
he
had
dealt
her
belike
a
thousand
buffets
on
the
face
and
scratched
her
and
done
her
all
the
ill
in
the
world
and
now
he
beheld
her
as
if
nothing
of
all
this
had
been
her
brothers
told
her
briefly
what
they
had
heard
from
arriguccio
twine
and
beating
and
all
whereupon
she
turned
to
him
and
said
husband
mine
what
is
this
i
hear
why
wilt
thou
make
me
pass
to
thine
own
great
shame
for
an
ill
woman
where
as
i
am
none
and
thyself
for
a
cruel
and
wicked
man
which
thou
art
not
when
wast
thou
in
this
house
till
now
let
alone
with
me
when
didst
thou
beat
me
for
my
part
i
have
no
remembrance
of
it
vile
woman
that
thou
art
cried
he
we
not
go
to
bed
together
here
did
i
not
return
hither
after
running
after
thy
lover
did
i
not
deal
thee
a
thousand
buffets
and
cut
off
thy
hair
wentest
not
to
bed
in
this
house
replied
sismonda
let
that
pass
for
i
can
give
no
proof
thereof
other
than
mine
own
true
words
and
let
us
come
to
that
which
thou
sayest
to
wit
that
thou
didst
beat
me
and
cut
off
my
hair
me
thou
hast
never
beaten
and
do
all
who
are
here
and
thou
thyself
take
note
of
me
if
i
have
any
mark
of
beating
in
any
part
of
my
person
indeed
i
should
not
counsel
thee
make
so
bold
as
to
lay
a
hand
on
me
for
by
christ
his
cross
i
would
mar
thy
face
for
thee
neither
didst
thou
cut
off
my
hair
for
aught
that
i
felt
or
saw
but
haply
thou
didst
it
on
such
wise
that
i
perceived
it
not
let
me
see
if
i
have
it
shorn
or
no
then
putting
off
her
veil
from
her
head
she
showed
that
she
had
her
hair
unshorn
and
whole
her
mother
and
brothers
seeing
and
hearing
all
this
turned
upon
her
husband
and
said
to
him
meanest
thou
arriguccio
this
is
not
that
so
far
which
thou
camest
to
tell
us
thou
hadst
done
and
we
know
not
how
thou
wilt
make
good
the
rest
arriguccio
stood
as
one
in
a
trance
and
would
have
spoken
but
seeing
that
it
was
not
as
he
thought
he
could
show
he
dared
say
nothing
whereupon
the
lady
turning
to
her
brothers
said
to
them
mine
i
see
he
hath
gone
seeking
to
have
me
do
what
i
have
never
yet
chosen
to
do
to
wit
that
i
should
acquaint
you
with
his
lewdness
and
his
vile
fashions
and
i
will
do
it
i
firmly
believe
that
this
he
hath
told
you
hath
verily
befallen
him
and
that
he
hath
done
as
he
saith
and
you
shall
hear
how
this
worthy
man
to
whom
in
an
ill
hour
for
me
you
gave
me
to
wife
who
calleth
himself
a
merchant
and
would
be
thought
a
man
of
credit
this
fellow
forsooth
who
should
be
more
temperate
than
a
monk
and
chaster
than
a
maid
there
be
few
nights
but
he
goeth
fuddling
himself
about
the
taverns
foregathering
now
with
this
lewd
woman
and
now
with
that
and
keeping
me
waiting
for
him
on
such
wise
as
you
find
me
half
the
night
and
whiles
even
till
morning
i
doubt
not
but
that
having
well
drunken
he
went
to
bed
with
some
trull
of
his
and
waking
found
the
twine
on
her
foot
and
after
did
all
these
his
fine
feats
whereof
he
telleth
winding
up
by
returning
to
her
and
beating
her
and
cutting
off
her
hair
and
not
being
yet
well
come
to
himself
he
fancied
and
i
doubt
not
yet
fancieth
that
he
did
all
this
to
me
and
if
you
look
him
well
in
the
face
you
will
see
he
is
yet
half
fuddled
algates
whatsoever
he
may
have
said
of
me
i
will
not
have
you
take
it
to
yourselves
except
as
a
drunken
man
talk
and
since
i
forgive
him
do
you
also
pardon
him
her
mother
hearing
this
began
to
make
an
outcry
and
say
christ
his
cross
daughter
mine
it
shall
not
pass
thus
nay
he
should
rather
be
slain
for
a
thankless
dog
who
was
never
worthy
to
have
a
girl
of
thy
fashion
to
wife
marry
a
fine
thing
forsooth
he
could
have
used
thee
no
worse
had
he
picked
thee
up
out
of
the
dirt
devil
take
him
if
thou
shalt
abide
at
the
mercy
of
the
spite
of
a
paltry
little
merchant
of
asses
dung
they
come
to
us
out
of
their
pigstyes
in
the
country
clad
in
homespun
frieze
with
their
and
pen
in
arse
and
as
soon
as
they
have
gotten
a
leash
of
groats
they
must
have
the
daughters
of
gentlemen
and
right
ladies
to
wife
and
bear
arms
and
say
i
am
of
such
a
family
and
those
of
my
house
did
thus
and
thus
would
god
my
sons
had
followed
my
counsel
in
the
matter
for
that
they
might
have
stablished
thee
so
worshipfully
in
the
family
of
the
counts
guidi
with
a
crust
of
bread
to
thy
dowry
but
they
must
needs
give
thee
to
this
fine
jewel
of
fellow
who
whereas
thou
art
the
best
girl
in
florence
and
the
modestest
is
not
ashamed
to
knock
us
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
tell
us
that
thou
art
a
strumpet
as
if
we
knew
thee
not
but
by
god
his
faith
an
they
would
be
ruled
by
me
he
should
get
such
a
trouncing
therefor
that
he
should
stink
for
it
then
turning
to
the
lady
brothers
sons
said
she
told
you
this
could
not
be
have
you
heard
how
your
fine
here
entreateth
your
sister
huckster
that
he
is
were
i
in
your
shoes
he
having
said
what
he
hath
of
her
and
doing
that
which
he
doth
i
would
never
hold
myself
content
nor
appeased
till
i
had
rid
the
earth
of
him
and
were
i
a
man
as
i
am
a
woman
i
would
trouble
none
other
than
myself
to
despatch
his
business
confound
him
for
a
sorry
drunken
beast
that
hath
no
shame
footnote
or
in
modern
parlance
the
young
men
seeing
and
hearing
all
this
turned
upon
arriguccio
and
gave
him
the
soundest
rating
ever
losel
got
and
ultimately
they
said
to
him
pardon
thee
this
as
to
a
drunken
man
but
as
thou
tenderest
thy
life
look
henceforward
we
hear
no
more
news
of
this
kind
for
if
aught
of
the
like
come
ever
again
to
our
ears
we
will
pay
thee
at
once
for
this
and
for
that
so
saying
they
went
their
ways
leaving
arriguccio
all
aghast
as
it
were
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
wits
unknowing
in
himself
whether
that
which
he
had
done
had
really
been
or
whether
he
had
dreamed
it
wherefore
he
made
no
more
words
thereof
but
left
his
wife
in
peace
thus
the
lady
by
her
ready
wit
not
only
escaped
the
imminent
peril
that
threatened
her
but
opened
herself
a
way
to
do
her
every
pleasure
in
time
to
come
without
evermore
having
any
fear
of
her
husband
the
ninth
story
day
the
seventh
lydia
wife
of
nicostratus
loveth
pyrrhus
who
so
he
may
believe
it
requireth
of
her
three
things
all
which
she
doth
moreover
she
solaceth
herself
with
him
in
the
presence
of
nicostratus
and
maketh
the
latter
believe
that
that
which
he
hath
seen
is
not
real
neifile
story
so
pleased
the
ladies
that
they
could
neither
give
over
to
laugh
at
nor
to
talk
of
it
albeit
the
king
having
bidden
pamfilo
tell
his
story
had
several
times
imposed
silence
upon
them
however
after
they
had
held
their
peace
pamfilo
began
thus
i
do
not
believe
worshipful
ladies
that
there
is
anything
how
hard
and
doubtful
soever
it
be
that
whoso
loveth
passionately
will
not
dare
to
do
the
which
albeit
it
hath
already
been
demonstrated
in
many
stories
methinketh
nevertheless
i
shall
be
able
yet
more
plainly
to
show
forth
to
you
in
one
which
i
purpose
to
tell
you
and
wherein
you
shall
hear
of
a
lady
who
was
in
her
actions
much
more
favoured
of
fortune
than
of
reason
wherefore
i
would
not
counsel
any
one
to
adventure
herself
in
the
footsteps
of
her
of
whom
i
am
to
tell
for
that
fortune
is
not
always
well
disposed
nor
are
all
men
in
the
world
equally
blind
in
argos
city
of
achia
far
more
famous
for
its
kings
of
past
time
than
great
in
itself
there
was
once
a
nobleman
called
nicostratus
to
whom
when
already
neighbouring
on
old
age
fortune
awarded
a
lady
of
great
family
to
wife
whose
name
was
lydia
and
who
was
no
less
than
fair
nicostratus
like
a
nobleman
and
a
man
of
wealth
as
he
was
kept
many
servants
and
hounds
and
hawks
and
took
the
utmost
delight
in
the
chase
among
his
other
servants
he
had
a
young
man
called
pyrrhus
who
was
sprightly
and
well
bred
and
comely
of
his
person
and
adroit
in
all
that
he
had
a
mind
to
do
and
him
he
loved
and
trusted
over
all
else
of
this
pyrrhus
lydia
became
so
sore
enamoured
that
neither
by
day
nor
by
night
could
she
have
her
thought
otherwhere
than
with
him
but
he
whether
it
was
that
he
perceived
not
her
liking
for
him
or
that
he
would
none
of
it
appeared
to
reck
nothing
thereof
by
reason
whereof
the
lady
suffered
intolerable
chagrin
in
herself
and
being
altogether
resolved
to
give
him
to
know
of
her
passion
called
a
chamberwoman
of
hers
lusca
by
name
in
whom
she
much
trusted
and
said
to
her
the
favours
thou
hast
had
of
me
should
make
thee
faithful
and
obedient
wherefore
look
thou
none
ever
know
that
which
i
shall
presently
say
to
thee
save
he
to
whom
i
shall
charge
thee
tell
it
as
thou
seest
lusca
i
am
a
young
and
lusty
lady
abundantly
endowed
with
all
those
things
which
any
woman
can
desire
in
brief
i
can
complain
of
but
one
thing
to
wit
that
my
husband
years
are
overmany
an
they
be
measured
by
mine
own
wherefore
i
fare
but
ill
in
the
matter
of
that
thing
wherein
young
women
take
most
pleasure
and
none
the
less
desiring
it
as
other
women
do
i
have
this
long
while
determined
in
myself
since
fortune
hath
been
thus
little
my
friend
in
giving
me
so
old
a
husband
that
i
will
not
be
so
much
mine
own
enemy
as
not
to
contrive
to
find
means
for
my
pleasures
and
my
weal
which
that
i
may
have
as
complete
in
this
as
in
other
things
i
have
bethought
myself
to
will
that
our
pyrrhus
as
being
worthier
thereof
than
any
other
should
furnish
them
with
his
embracements
nay
i
have
vowed
him
so
great
a
love
that
i
never
feel
myself
at
ease
save
whenas
i
see
him
or
think
of
him
and
except
i
foregather
with
him
without
delay
methinketh
i
shall
certainly
die
thereof
wherefore
if
my
life
be
dear
to
thee
thou
wilt
on
such
wise
as
shall
seem
best
to
thee
signify
to
him
any
love
and
beseech
him
on
my
part
to
be
pleased
to
come
to
me
whenas
thou
shalt
go
for
him
the
chamberwoman
replied
that
she
would
well
and
taking
pyrrhus
apart
whenas
first
it
seemed
to
her
time
and
place
she
did
her
errand
to
him
as
best
she
knew
pyrrhus
hearing
this
was
sore
amazed
thereat
as
one
who
had
never
anywise
perceived
aught
of
the
matter
and
misdoubted
him
the
lady
had
let
say
this
to
him
to
try
him
wherefore
he
answered
roughly
and
hastily
i
can
not
believe
that
these
words
come
from
my
lady
wherefore
have
a
care
what
thou
sayst
or
if
they
do
indeed
come
from
her
i
do
not
believe
that
she
caused
thee
say
them
with
intent
and
even
if
she
did
so
my
lord
doth
me
more
honour
than
i
deserve
and
i
would
not
for
my
life
do
him
such
an
outrage
wherefore
look
thou
bespeak
me
no
more
of
such
things
lusca
nowise
daunted
by
his
austere
speech
said
to
him
i
will
bespeak
thee
both
of
this
and
of
everything
else
wherewithal
my
lady
shall
charge
me
when
and
as
often
as
she
shall
bid
me
whether
it
cause
thee
pleasure
or
annoy
but
thou
art
an
ass
then
somewhat
despited
at
his
words
she
returned
to
her
mistress
who
hearing
what
pyrrhus
had
said
wished
for
death
but
some
days
after
she
again
bespoke
the
chamberwoman
of
the
matter
and
said
to
her
thou
knowest
that
the
oak
falleth
not
for
the
first
stroke
wherefore
meseemeth
well
that
thou
return
anew
to
him
who
so
strangely
willeth
to
abide
loyal
to
my
prejudice
and
taking
a
sortable
occasion
throughly
discover
to
him
my
passion
and
do
thine
every
endeavour
that
the
thing
may
have
effect
for
that
an
it
fall
through
thus
i
shall
assuredly
die
of
it
moreover
he
will
think
to
have
been
befooled
and
whereas
we
seek
to
have
his
love
hate
will
ensue
thereof
the
maid
comforted
her
and
going
in
quest
of
pyrrhus
found
him
merry
and
and
said
to
him
i
showed
thee
a
few
days
agone
in
what
a
fire
my
lady
and
thine
abideth
for
the
love
she
beareth
thee
and
now
anew
i
certify
thee
thereof
for
that
an
thou
persist
in
the
rigour
thou
showedst
the
other
day
thou
mayst
be
assured
that
she
will
not
live
long
wherefore
i
prithee
be
pleased
to
satisfy
her
of
her
desire
and
if
thou
yet
abide
fast
in
thine
obstinacy
whereas
i
have
still
accounted
thee
mighty
discreet
i
shall
hold
thee
a
blockhead
what
can
be
a
greater
glory
for
thee
than
that
such
a
lady
so
fair
and
so
noble
should
love
thee
over
all
else
besides
how
greatly
shouldst
thou
acknowledge
thyself
beholden
unto
fortune
seeing
that
she
proffereth
thee
a
thing
of
such
worth
and
so
conformable
to
the
desires
of
thy
youth
and
to
boot
such
a
resource
for
thy
necessities
which
of
thy
peers
knowest
thou
who
fareth
better
by
way
of
delight
than
thou
mayst
fare
an
thou
be
wise
what
other
couldst
thou
find
who
may
fare
so
well
in
the
matter
of
arms
and
horses
and
apparel
and
monies
as
thou
mayst
do
so
thou
wilt
but
vouchsafe
thy
love
to
this
lady
open
then
thy
mind
to
my
words
and
return
to
thy
senses
bethink
thee
that
once
and
no
oftener
it
is
wont
to
betide
that
fortune
cometh
unto
a
man
with
smiling
face
and
open
arms
who
an
he
know
not
then
to
welcome
if
after
he
find
himself
poor
and
beggarly
he
hath
himself
and
not
her
to
blame
besides
there
is
no
call
to
use
that
loyalty
between
servants
and
masters
that
behoveth
between
friends
and
kinsfolk
nay
servants
should
use
their
masters
in
so
far
as
they
may
like
as
themselves
are
used
of
them
thinkest
thou
an
thou
hadst
a
fair
wife
or
mother
or
daughter
or
sister
who
pleased
nicostratus
that
he
would
go
questing
after
this
loyalty
that
thou
wouldst
fain
observe
towards
him
in
respect
of
this
lady
thou
are
a
fool
if
thou
think
thus
for
thou
mayst
hold
it
for
certain
that
if
blandishments
and
prayers
sufficed
him
not
he
would
not
scruple
to
use
force
in
the
matter
whatsoever
thou
mightest
deem
thereof
let
us
then
entreat
them
and
their
affairs
even
as
they
entreat
us
and
ours
profit
by
the
favour
of
fortune
and
drive
her
not
away
but
welcome
her
with
open
arms
and
meet
her
halfway
for
assuredly
and
thou
do
it
not
thou
wilt
yet
leave
alone
the
death
that
will
without
fail
ensue
thereof
to
thy
lady
repent
thee
thereof
so
many
a
time
thou
wilt
be
fain
to
die
therefor
pyrrhus
who
had
again
and
again
pondered
the
words
that
lusca
had
said
to
him
had
determined
and
she
should
return
to
him
to
make
her
another
guess
answer
and
altogether
to
submit
himself
to
comply
with
the
lady
wishes
so
but
he
might
be
certified
that
it
was
not
a
trick
to
try
him
and
accordingly
answered
lusca
all
that
thou
sayst
to
me
i
allow
to
be
true
but
on
the
other
hand
i
know
my
lord
for
very
discreet
and
and
as
he
committeth
all
his
affairs
to
my
hands
i
am
sore
adread
lest
lydia
with
his
counsel
and
by
his
wish
do
this
to
try
me
wherefore
an
it
please
her
for
mine
assurance
do
three
things
that
i
shall
ask
she
shall
for
certain
thereafterward
command
me
nought
but
i
will
do
it
forthright
and
the
three
things
i
desire
are
these
first
that
in
nicostratus
his
presence
she
slay
his
good
hawk
secondly
that
she
send
me
a
lock
of
her
husband
beard
and
lastly
one
of
his
best
teeth
these
conditions
seemed
hard
unto
lusca
and
to
the
lady
harder
yet
however
love
who
is
an
excellent
comforter
and
a
past
master
in
shifts
and
devices
made
her
resolve
to
do
his
pleasure
and
accordingly
she
sent
him
word
by
her
chamberwoman
that
she
would
punctually
do
what
he
required
and
that
quickly
and
that
over
and
above
this
for
that
he
deemed
nicostratus
so
she
would
solace
herself
with
him
in
her
husband
presence
and
make
the
latter
believe
that
it
was
not
true
footnote
syn
encourager
helper
auxiliary
pyrrhus
accordingly
began
to
await
what
the
lady
should
do
and
nicostratus
having
a
few
days
after
made
as
he
oftentimes
used
to
do
a
great
dinner
to
certain
gentlemen
madam
lydia
whenas
the
tables
were
cleared
away
came
forth
of
her
chamber
clad
in
green
samite
and
richly
bedecked
and
entered
the
saloon
where
the
guests
were
there
in
the
sight
of
pyrrhus
and
of
all
the
rest
she
went
up
to
the
perch
whereon
was
the
hawk
that
nicostratus
held
so
dear
and
cast
it
loose
as
she
would
set
it
on
her
hand
then
taking
it
by
the
jesses
she
dashed
it
against
the
wall
and
killed
it
whereupon
nicostratus
cried
out
at
her
saying
wife
what
hast
thou
done
she
answered
him
nothing
but
turning
to
the
gentlemen
who
had
eaten
with
him
she
said
to
them
i
should
ill
know
how
to
avenge
myself
on
a
king
who
did
me
a
despite
an
i
dared
not
take
my
wreak
of
a
hawk
you
must
know
that
this
bird
hath
long
robbed
me
of
all
the
time
which
should
of
men
be
accorded
to
the
pleasuring
of
the
ladies
for
that
no
sooner
is
the
day
risen
than
nicostratus
is
up
and
drest
and
away
he
goeth
with
his
hawk
on
his
fist
to
the
open
plains
to
see
him
fly
whilst
i
such
as
you
see
me
abide
in
bed
alone
and
wherefore
i
have
many
a
time
had
a
mind
to
do
that
which
i
have
now
done
nor
hath
aught
hindered
me
therefrom
but
that
i
waited
to
do
it
in
the
presence
of
gentlemen
who
would
be
just
judges
in
my
quarrel
as
methinketh
you
will
be
the
gentlemen
hearing
this
and
believing
her
affection
for
nicostratus
to
be
no
otherwise
than
as
her
words
denoted
turned
all
to
the
latter
who
was
angered
and
said
laughing
how
well
hath
the
lady
done
to
avenge
herself
of
her
wrong
by
the
death
of
the
hawk
then
with
divers
of
pleasantries
upon
the
subject
the
lady
being
now
gone
back
to
her
chamber
they
turned
nicostratus
his
annoy
into
laughter
whilst
pyrrhus
seeing
all
this
said
in
himself
lady
hath
given
a
noble
beginning
to
my
happy
loves
god
grant
she
persevere
lydia
having
thus
slain
the
hawk
not
many
days
were
passed
when
being
in
her
chamber
with
nicostratus
she
fell
to
toying
and
frolicking
with
him
and
he
pulling
her
somedele
by
the
hair
by
way
of
sport
gave
her
occasion
to
accomplish
the
second
thing
required
of
her
by
pyrrhus
accordingly
taking
him
of
a
sudden
by
a
lock
of
his
beard
she
tugged
so
hard
at
it
laughing
the
while
that
she
plucked
it
clean
out
of
his
chin
whereof
he
complaining
now
quoth
she
aileth
thee
to
pull
such
a
face
is
it
because
i
have
plucked
out
maybe
half
a
dozen
hairs
of
thy
beard
thou
feltest
not
that
which
i
suffered
whenas
thou
pulledst
me
now
by
the
hair
on
this
wise
continuing
their
disport
from
one
word
to
another
she
privily
kept
the
lock
of
hair
that
she
had
plucked
from
his
beard
and
sent
it
that
same
day
to
her
lover
anent
the
last
of
the
three
things
required
by
pyrrhus
she
was
harder
put
to
it
for
a
device
nevertheless
being
of
a
surpassing
wit
and
love
making
her
yet
quicker
of
invention
she
soon
bethought
herself
what
means
she
should
use
to
give
it
accomplishment
nicostratus
had
two
boys
given
him
of
their
father
to
the
intent
that
being
of
gentle
birth
they
might
learn
somewhat
of
manners
and
good
breeding
in
his
house
of
whom
whenas
he
was
at
meat
one
carved
before
him
and
the
other
gave
him
to
drink
lydia
called
them
both
and
giving
them
to
believe
that
they
stank
at
the
mouth
enjoined
them
that
whenas
they
served
nicostratus
they
should
still
hold
their
heads
backward
as
most
they
might
nor
ever
tell
this
to
any
the
boys
believing
that
which
she
said
proceeded
to
do
as
she
had
lessoned
them
and
she
after
a
while
said
to
her
husband
one
day
thou
noted
that
which
yonder
boys
do
whenas
they
serve
thee
have
i
replied
nicostratus
indeed
i
had
it
in
mind
to
ask
them
why
they
did
it
quoth
the
lady
it
not
for
i
can
tell
thee
the
reason
and
i
have
kept
it
silent
from
thee
this
long
while
not
to
cause
thee
annoy
but
now
i
perceive
that
others
begin
to
be
aware
thereof
it
skilleth
not
to
hide
it
from
thee
longer
this
betideth
thee
for
none
other
what
than
that
thou
stinkest
terribly
at
the
mouth
and
i
know
not
what
can
be
the
cause
thereof
for
that
it
used
not
to
be
thus
now
this
is
a
very
unseemly
thing
for
thee
who
hast
to
do
with
gentlemen
and
needs
must
we
see
for
a
means
of
curing
it
whereupon
said
he
can
this
be
can
i
have
some
rotten
tooth
in
my
head
ay
answered
lydia
and
carried
him
to
a
window
where
she
made
him
open
his
mouth
and
after
she
had
viewed
it
in
every
part
nicostratus
cried
she
canst
thou
have
put
up
with
it
so
long
thou
hast
a
tooth
on
this
side
which
meseemth
is
not
only
decayed
but
altogether
rotten
and
assuredly
and
thou
keep
it
much
longer
in
thy
mouth
it
will
mar
thee
those
which
be
on
either
side
wherefore
i
counsel
thee
have
it
drawn
ere
the
thing
go
farther
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
answered
he
will
well
let
a
surgeon
be
sent
for
without
more
delay
who
shall
draw
it
for
me
forbid
rejoined
the
lady
a
surgeon
come
hither
for
that
methinketh
it
lieth
on
such
wise
that
i
myself
without
any
surgeon
can
very
well
draw
it
for
thee
more
by
token
that
these
same
surgeons
are
so
barbarous
in
doing
such
offices
that
my
heart
would
on
no
account
suffer
me
to
see
or
know
thee
in
the
hands
of
any
one
of
them
for
an
it
irk
thee
overmuch
i
will
at
least
loose
thee
incontinent
which
a
surgeon
would
not
do
accordingly
she
let
fetch
the
proper
instruments
and
sent
every
one
forth
of
the
chamber
except
only
lusca
after
which
locking
herself
in
she
made
nicostratus
lie
down
on
a
table
and
thrusting
the
pincers
into
his
mouth
what
while
the
maid
held
him
fast
she
pulled
out
one
of
his
teeth
by
main
force
albeit
he
roared
out
lustily
for
the
pain
then
keeping
to
herself
that
which
she
had
drawn
she
brought
out
a
frightfully
decayed
tooth
she
had
ready
in
her
hand
and
showed
it
to
her
husband
half
dead
as
he
was
for
pain
saying
what
thou
hast
had
in
thy
mouth
all
this
while
nicostratus
believed
what
she
said
and
now
that
the
tooth
was
out
for
all
he
had
suffered
the
most
grievous
pain
and
made
sore
complaint
thereof
him
seemed
he
was
cured
and
presently
having
comforted
himself
with
one
thing
and
another
and
the
pain
being
abated
he
went
forth
of
the
chamber
whereupon
his
wife
took
the
tooth
and
straightway
despatched
it
to
her
gallant
who
being
now
certified
of
her
love
professed
himself
ready
to
do
her
every
pleasure
the
lady
albeit
every
hour
seemed
to
her
a
thousand
till
she
should
be
with
him
desiring
to
give
him
farther
assurance
and
wishful
to
perform
that
which
she
had
promised
him
made
a
show
one
day
of
being
ailing
and
being
visited
after
dinner
by
nicostratus
with
no
one
in
his
company
but
pyrrhus
she
prayed
them
by
way
of
allaying
her
unease
to
help
her
go
into
the
garden
accordingly
nicostratus
taking
her
on
one
side
and
pyrrhus
on
the
other
they
carried
her
into
the
garden
and
set
her
down
on
a
grassplot
at
the
foot
of
a
fine
where
after
they
had
sat
awhile
the
lady
who
had
already
given
her
gallant
to
know
what
he
had
to
do
said
i
have
a
great
desire
to
eat
of
yonder
pears
do
thou
climb
up
and
throw
us
down
some
of
them
pyrrhus
straightway
climbed
up
into
the
tree
and
fell
to
throwing
down
of
the
pears
which
as
he
did
he
began
to
say
now
my
lord
what
is
this
you
do
and
you
madam
are
you
not
ashamed
to
suffer
it
in
my
presence
think
you
i
am
blind
but
now
you
were
sore
disordered
how
cometh
it
you
have
so
quickly
recovered
that
you
do
such
things
an
you
have
a
mind
unto
this
you
have
store
of
goodly
chambers
why
go
you
not
do
it
in
one
of
these
it
were
more
seemly
than
in
my
presence
the
lady
turned
to
her
husband
and
said
saith
pyrrhus
doth
he
rave
madam
answered
the
young
man
rave
not
think
you
i
can
not
see
as
for
nicostratus
he
marvelled
sore
and
said
pyrrhus
methinketh
thou
dreamest
lord
replied
pyrrhus
dream
not
a
jot
neither
do
you
dream
nay
you
bestir
yourselves
on
such
wise
that
were
this
tree
to
do
likewise
there
would
not
be
a
pear
left
on
it
quoth
the
lady
may
this
be
can
it
be
that
this
he
saith
appeareth
to
him
to
be
true
so
god
save
me
and
i
were
whole
as
i
was
aforetime
i
would
climb
up
into
the
tree
to
see
what
marvels
are
those
which
this
fellow
saith
he
seeth
meanwhile
pyrrhus
from
the
top
of
the
still
said
the
same
thing
and
kept
up
the
pretence
whereupon
nicostratus
bade
him
come
down
accordingly
he
came
down
and
his
master
said
to
him
what
sayst
thou
thou
sawest
answered
he
take
me
for
a
lackwit
or
a
loggerhead
since
i
must
needs
say
it
i
saw
you
of
your
lady
and
after
as
i
came
down
i
saw
you
arise
and
seat
yourself
where
you
presently
are
said
nicostratus
dotest
for
we
have
not
stirred
a
jot
save
as
thou
seest
since
thou
climbest
up
into
the
whereupon
quoth
pyrrhus
booteth
it
to
make
words
of
the
matter
i
certainly
saw
you
and
if
i
did
see
you
it
was
of
your
own
nicostratus
waxed
momently
more
and
more
astonished
insomuch
that
he
said
must
i
see
if
this
is
enchanted
and
if
whoso
is
thereon
seeth
marvels
thereupon
he
climbed
up
into
the
tree
and
no
sooner
was
he
come
to
the
top
than
the
lady
and
pyrrhus
fell
to
solacing
themselves
together
which
when
nicostratus
saw
he
began
to
cry
out
saying
vile
woman
that
thou
art
what
is
this
thou
dost
and
thou
pyrrhus
in
whom
i
most
trusted
so
saying
he
proceeded
to
descend
the
tree
whilst
the
lovers
said
are
sitting
here
then
seeing
him
come
down
they
reseated
themselves
whereas
he
had
left
them
as
soon
as
he
was
down
and
saw
his
wife
and
pyrrhus
where
he
had
left
them
he
fell
at
them
whereupon
quoth
pyrrhus
verily
nicostratus
i
acknowledged
that
as
you
said
before
i
must
have
seen
falsely
what
while
i
was
in
the
nor
do
i
know
it
otherwise
than
by
this
that
i
see
and
know
yourself
to
have
seen
falsely
in
the
like
case
and
that
i
speak
the
truth
nought
else
should
be
needful
to
certify
you
but
that
you
have
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
consider
if
it
be
possible
that
your
lady
who
is
the
most
virtuous
of
women
and
discreeter
than
any
other
of
her
sex
could
an
she
had
a
mind
to
outrage
you
on
such
wise
bring
herself
to
do
it
before
your
very
eyes
i
speak
not
of
myself
who
would
rather
suffer
myself
to
be
torn
than
so
much
as
think
of
such
a
thing
much
more
come
to
do
it
in
your
presence
wherefore
the
fault
of
this
misseeing
must
needs
proceed
from
the
for
that
all
the
world
had
not
made
me
believe
but
that
you
were
in
act
to
have
carnal
knowledge
of
your
lady
here
had
i
not
heard
you
say
that
it
appeared
to
yourself
that
i
did
what
i
know
most
certainly
i
never
thought
much
less
did
thereupon
the
lady
feigning
to
be
mightily
incensed
rose
to
her
feet
and
said
luck
betide
thee
dost
thou
hold
me
so
little
of
wit
that
an
i
had
a
mind
to
such
filthy
fashions
as
thou
wouldst
have
us
believe
thou
sawest
i
should
come
to
do
them
before
thy
very
eyes
thou
mayst
be
assured
of
this
that
if
ever
the
fancy
took
me
thereof
i
should
not
come
hither
marry
methinketh
i
should
have
sense
enough
to
contrive
it
in
one
of
our
chambers
on
such
wise
and
after
such
a
fashion
that
it
would
seem
to
me
an
extraordinary
thing
if
ever
thou
camest
to
know
of
it
nicostratus
himseeming
that
what
the
lady
and
pyrrhus
said
was
true
to
wit
that
they
would
never
have
ventured
upon
such
an
act
there
before
himself
gave
over
words
and
reproaches
and
fell
to
discoursing
of
the
strangeness
of
the
fact
and
the
miracle
of
the
sight
which
was
thus
changed
unto
whoso
climbed
up
into
the
but
his
wife
feigning
herself
chagrined
for
the
ill
thought
he
had
shown
of
her
said
this
shall
never
again
if
i
can
help
it
do
me
nor
any
other
lady
the
like
of
this
shame
wherefore
do
thou
run
pyrrhus
and
fetch
a
hatchet
and
at
one
stroke
avenge
both
thyself
and
me
by
cutting
it
down
albeit
it
were
better
yet
lay
it
about
nicostratus
his
cosard
who
without
any
consideration
suffered
the
eyes
of
his
understanding
to
be
so
quickly
blinded
whenas
however
certain
that
which
thou
saidst
might
seem
to
those
which
thou
hast
in
thy
head
thou
shouldst
for
nought
in
the
world
in
the
judgment
of
thy
mind
have
believed
or
allowed
that
such
a
thing
could
be
footnote
this
sudden
change
from
the
third
to
the
second
person
in
speaking
of
nicostratus
is
a
characteristic
example
of
constant
abuse
of
the
figure
enallage
in
his
dialogues
footnote
those
eyes
pyrrhus
very
readily
fetched
the
hatchet
and
cut
down
the
tree
which
when
the
lady
saw
fallen
she
said
to
nicostratus
i
see
the
enemy
of
mine
honour
overthrown
my
anger
is
past
and
graciously
forgave
her
husband
who
besought
her
thereof
charging
him
that
it
should
never
again
happen
to
him
to
presume
such
a
thing
of
her
who
loved
him
better
than

accordingly
the
wretched
husband
thus
befooled
returned
with
her
and
her
lover
to
the
palace

many
a

took

returning
to
his

according
to
promise
made

relateth
to
him
how
folk

rested
only
with
the

to
tell
and
he
accordingly
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
ladies
quieted
who
lamented
the
cutting
down
of
the
unoffending
began
it
is
a
very
manifest
thing
that
every
just
king
should
be
the
first
to
observe
the
laws
made
by
him
and
an
he
do
otherwise
he
must
be
adjudged
a
slave
deserving
of
punishment
and
not
a
king
into
which
offence
and
under
which
reproach
i
who
am
your
king
am
in
a
manner
constrained
to
fall
true
it
is
that
yesterday
i
laid
down
the
law
for
discourses
purposing
not
this
day
to
make
use
of
my
privilege
but
submitting
myself
to
the
same
obligation
as
you
to
discourse
of
that
whereof
you
have
all
discoursed
however
not
only
hath
that
story
been
told
which
i
had
thought
to
tell
but
so
many
other
and
far
finer
things
have
been
said
upon
the
matter
that
for
my
part
ransack
my
memory
as
i
will
i
can
call
nothing
to
mind
and
must
avouch
myself
unable
to
say
aught
anent
such
a
subject
that
may
compare
with
those
stories
which
have
already
been
told
wherefore
it
behoving
me
transgress
against
the
law
made
by
myself
i
declare
myself
in
advance
ready
as
one
deserving
of
punishment
to
submit
to
any
forfeit
which
may
be
imposed
on
me
and
so
have
recourse
to
my
wonted
privilege
accordingly
dearest
ladies
i
say
that
elisa
story
of
fra
rinaldo
and
his
gossip
and
eke
the
simplicity
of
the
siennese
have
such
efficacy
that
they
induce
me
letting
be
the
cheats
put
upon
foolish
husbands
by
their
wily
wives
to
tell
you
a
slight
story
of
them
which
though
it
have
in
it
no
little
of
that
which
must
not
be
believed
will
natheless
in
part
at
least
be
pleasing
to
hear
footnote
the
siennese
there
were
then
in
siena
two
young
men
of
the
people
whereof
one
was
called
tingoccio
mini
and
the
other
meuccio
di
tura
they
abode
at
porta
salaja
and
consorted
well
nigh
never
save
one
with
the
other
to
all
appearance
they
loved
each
exceedingly
and
resorting
as
men
do
to
churches
and
preachings
they
had
many
a
time
heard
tell
of
the
happiness
and
of
the
misery
that
are
according
to
their
deserts
allotted
in
the
next
world
to
the
souls
of
those
who
die
of
which
things
desiring
to
have
certain
news
and
finding
no
way
thereto
they
promised
one
another
that
whichever
of
them
died
first
should
an
he
might
return
to
him
who
abode
on
life
and
give
him
tidings
of
that
which
he
would
fain
know
and
this
they
confirmed
with
an
oath
having
come
to
this
accord
and
companying
still
together
as
hath
been
said
it
chanced
that
tingoccio
became
godfather
to
a
child
which
one
ambruogio
anselmini
abiding
at
campo
reggi
had
had
of
his
wife
mistress
mita
by
name
and
from
time
to
time
visiting
together
with
meuccio
his
gossip
who
was
a
very
fair
and
lovesome
lady
he
became
notwithstanding
the
gossipship
enamoured
of
her
meuccio
on
like
wise
hearing
her
mightily
commended
of
his
friend
and
being
himself
much
pleased
with
her
fell
in
love
with
her
and
each
hid
his
love
from
the
other
but
not
for
one
same
reason
tingoccio
was
careful
not
to
discover
it
to
meuccio
on
account
of
the
naughty
deed
which
himseemed
he
did
to
love
his
gossip
and
which
he
had
been
ashamed
that
any
should
know
meuccio
on
the
other
hand
kept
himself
therefrom
for
that
he
had
already
perceived
that
the
lady
pleased
tingoccio
whereupon
he
said
in
himself
i
discover
this
to
him
he
will
wax
jealous
of
me
and
being
able
as
her
gossip
to
bespeak
her
at
his
every
pleasure
he
will
inasmuch
as
he
may
bring
me
in
ill
savour
with
her
and
so
i
shall
never
have
of
her
aught
that
may
please
me
footnote
from
discovering
to
his
friend
his
liking
for
the
lady
things
being
at
this
pass
it
befell
that
tingoccio
having
more
leisure
of
discovering
his
every
desire
to
the
lady
contrived
with
acts
and
words
so
to
do
that
he
had
his
will
of
her
of
which
meuccio
soon
became
aware
and
albeit
it
sore
misliked
him
yet
hoping
some
time
or
other
to
compass
his
desire
he
feigned
ignorance
thereof
so
tingoccio
might
not
have
cause
or
occasion
to
do
him
an
ill
turn
or
hinder
him
in
any
of
his
affairs
the
two
friends
loving
thus
the
one
more
happily
than
the
other
it
befell
that
tingoccio
finding
the
soil
of
his
gossip
demesne
soft
and
eath
to
till
so
delved
and
laboured
there
that
there
overcame
him
thereof
a
malady
which
after
some
days
waxed
so
heavy
upon
him
that
being
unable
to
brook
it
he
departed
this
life
the
third
day
after
his
death
for
that
belike
he
had
not
before
been
able
he
came
by
night
according
to
the
promise
made
into
meuccio
chamber
and
called
the
latter
who
slept
fast
meuccio
awoke
and
said
art
thou
whereto
he
answered
am
tingoccio
who
according
to
the
promise
which
i
made
thee
am
come
back
to
thee
to
give
thee
news
of
the
other
world
meuccio
was
somewhat
affrighted
at
seeing
him
nevertheless
taking
heart
art
welcome
brother
mine
quoth
he
and
presently
asked
him
if
he
were
lost
are
lost
that
are
not
to
be
found
replied
tingoccio
how
should
i
be
here
if
i
were
lost
cried
meuccio
say
not
so
nay
i
ask
thee
if
thou
art
among
the
damned
souls
in
the
avenging
fire
of
hell
whereto
quoth
tingoccio
for
that
no
but
i
am
notwithstanding
in
very
grievous
and
anguishful
torment
for
the
sins
committed
by
me
meuccio
then
particularly
enquired
of
him
what
punishments
were
awarded
in
the
other
world
for
each
of
the
sins
that
folk
use
to
commit
here
below
and
he
told
him
them
all
after
this
meuccio
asked
if
there
were
aught
he
might
do
for
him
in
this
world
whereto
tingoccio
replied
that
there
was
to
wit
that
he
should
let
say
for
him
masses
and
orisons
and
do
alms
in
his
name
for
that
these
things
were
mightily
profitable
to
those
who
abode
yonder
meuccio
said
that
he
would
well
and
tingoccio
offering
to
take
leave
of
him
he
remembered
himself
of
the
latter
amour
with
his
gossip
and
raising
his
head
said
that
i
bethink
me
tingoccio
what
punishment
is
given
thee
over
yonder
anent
thy
gossip
with
whom
thou
layest
whenas
thou
wast
here
below
mine
answered
tingoccio
i
came
yonder
there
was
one
who
it
seemed
knew
all
my
sins
by
heart
and
bade
me
betake
myself
to
a
certain
place
where
i
bemoaned
my
offences
in
exceeding
sore
punishment
and
where
i
found
many
companions
condemned
to
the
same
penance
as
myself
being
among
them
and
remembering
me
of
that
which
i
had
done
whilere
with
my
gossip
i
looked
for
a
much
sorer
punishment
on
account
thereof
than
that
which
had
presently
been
given
me
and
went
all
shivering
for
fear
albeit
i
was
in
a
great
fire
and
an
exceeding
hot
which
one
who
was
by
my
side
perceiving
he
said
to
me
what
aileth
thee
more
than
all
the
others
who
are
here
that
thou
shiverest
being
in
the
fire
marry
said
i
my
friend
i
am
sore
in
fear
of
the
sentence
i
expect
for
a
grievous
sin
i
wrought

the

asked
me
what
sin
this
was

i
answered
it
was
that
i
lay
with
a
gossip

mine

that
with
such
a
vengeance

it
cost
me
my

no

no
manner
of
account
taken
of
gossips
which
when
i
heard
i
was
altogether
reassured
this
said
and
the
day
drawing
near
quoth
he
with
god
for
i
may
no
longer
be
with
thee
and
was
suddenly
gone

hearing
that
no
account
was
taken
of
gossips

began
to
make
mock
of
his
own
simplicity
for
that
whiles
he
had
spared
several
of
them
wherefore
laying
by
his
ignorance
he
became
wiser
in
that
respect
for
the
future
which
things
if
fra
rinaldo
had
known
he
had
not
needed
to
go

he
converted
his
good

to
his
pleasure

zephyr
was
now
arisen
for
the
sun

drew
near
unto
the
setting
when
the
king
having
made
an
end
of
his
story
and
there
being
none
other
left
to
tell
put
off
the
crown
from
his
own
head
and
set
it
on

you

bade
him
look

dismissed

accordingly
they
all
ladies

arose
and
some
began
to
go
barefoot
through
the
clear
water
whilst
others
went
upon
the
greensward

the
straight
and
goodly
trees

sang

taking
various

delights
they
passed
the
time
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
until
the
hour
of
supper
which
being
come
they
seated
themselves
at
table
beside
the
lakelet
and
there
to
the
song
of

thousand
birds
still
refreshed
by
a
gentle

came
from

supped
in

being
removed
and
the

being

high
after
they
had
gone
awhile

they
wended
their

again

as
it
pleased
their
queen
with
slow
steps
towards
their
wonted
and
jesting
and
chattering
a
thousand
things
as
well
of
those
whereof
it
had
been

day
discoursed

they
came
near
upon
nightfall
to
the
fair
palace
where
having
with
the
coolest
of
wines
and
confections
done
away
the
fatigues
of
the
little
journey
they
presently
fell
to
dancing
about
the
fair
fountain
carolling

to
the
sound
of
tindaro
bagpipe
and

to
that
of

after
awhile
the

bade

sing

the

at

this

caused
all
the
company
conclude
that
a
new
and
pleasing
love
held
filomena
in
bonds
and
as
by
the
words
it
appeared
that
she
had
tasted
more
thereof
than
sight
alone
she
was
envied
of
this
by
certain
who
were
there
and
who
held
her
therefor
so
much
the
happier
but
after
her
song
was
ended
the
queen
remembering
her
that
the
ensuing
day
was
friday
thus
graciously
bespoke
all
you
know
noble
ladies
and
you
also
young
men
that
is
the
day
consecrated
to
the
passion
of
our
lord
the
which
an
you
remember
aright
what
time
neifile
was

we
celebrated
devoutly
and
therein
gave
pause
to
our
delightsome
discoursements
and
on
like
wise
we
did
with
the
following
saturday
wherefore
being
minded
to
follow
the
good
example
given
us
by
neifile
i
hold
it
seemly
that
and
the
next
day
we
abstain
even
as
we
did
a
week
agone
from
our
pleasant
recalling
to
memory
that
which
on
those
days
befell
whilere

salvation

speech
was
pleasing
unto

already
on
the
sunday
morning
the
rays
of
the
rising
light
appeared
on
the
summits
of
the
higher
mountains
and
every
shadow
having
departed
things
might
manifestly
be
discerned
when
the
queen
arising
with
her
company
went
wandering
first
through
the
dewy
grass
and
after
towards
visiting
a
little
neighboring
church
heard
there
divine
service
then
returning
home
they
ate
with
mirth
and
joyance
and
after
sang
and
danced
awhile
till
the
queen
dismissed
them
so
whoso
would
might
go
rest
himself
but
whenas
the
sun
had
passed
the
meridian
they
all
seated
themselves
according
as
it
pleased
the
queen
near
the
fair
fountain
for
the
wonted
and
neifile
by
her
commandment
began
thus

the
first

day
the
eighth
gulfardo
borroweth
of
guasparruolo
certain
monies
for
which
he
hath
agreed
with
his
wife
that
he
shall
lie
with
her
and
accordingly
giveth
them
to
her
then
in
her
presence
he
telleth
guasparruolo
that
he
gave
them
to
her
and
she
confesseth
it
to
be
true
since
god
hath
so
ordered
it
that
i
am
to
give
a
beginning
to
the
present
day
discourses
with
my
story
i
am
content
and
therefore
lovesome
ladies
seeing
that
much
hath
been
said
of
the
tricks
played
by
women
upon
men
it
is
my
pleasure
to
relate
one
played
by
a
man
upon
a
woman
not
that
i
mean
therein
to
blame
that
which
the
man
did
or
to
deny
that
it
served
the
woman
aright
nay
rather
to
commend
the
man
and
blame
the
woman
and
to
show
that
men
also
know
how
to
cozen
those
who
put
faith
in
them
even
as
themselves
are
cozened
by
those
in
whom
they
believe
indeed
to
speak
more
precisely
that
whereof
i
have
to
tell
should
not
be
called
cozenage
nay
it
should
rather
be
styled
a
just
requital
for
that
albeit
a
woman
should
still
be
virtuous
and
guard
her
chastity
as
her
life
nor
on
any
account
suffer
herself
be
persuaded
to
sully
it
yet
seeing
that
by
reason
of
our
frailty
this
is
not
always
possible
as
fully
as
should
be
i
affirm
that
she
who
consenteth
to
her
own
dishonour
for
a
price
is
worthy
of
the
fire
whereas
she
who
yieldeth
for
love
sake
knowing
his
exceeding
great
puissance
meriteth
forgiveness
from
a
judge
not
too
severe
even
as
a
few
days
agone
filostrato
showed
it
to
have
been
observed
towards
madam
filippa
at
prato
there
was
then
aforetime
at
milan
a
german
by
name
gulfardo
in
the
pay
of
the
state
a
stout
fellow
of
his
person
and
very
loyal
to
those
in
whose
service
he
engaged
himself
which
is
seldom
the
case
with
germans
and
for
that
he
was
a
very
punctual
repayer
of
such
loans
as
were
made
him
he
might
always
find
many
merchants
ready
to
lend
him
any
quantity
of
money
at
little
usance
during
his
sojourn
in
milan
he
set
his
heart
upon
a
very
fair
lady
called
madam
ambruogia
the
wife
of
a
rich
merchant
by
name
guasparruolo
cagastraccio
who
was
much
his
acquaintance
and
friend
and
loving
her
very
discreetly
so
that
neither
her
husband
nor
any
other
suspected
it
he
sent
one
day
to
speak
with
her
praying
her
that
it
would
please
her
vouchsafe
him
her
favours
and
protesting
that
he
on
his
part
was
ready
to
do
whatsoever
she
should
command
him
the
lady
after
many
parleys
came
to
this
conclusion
that
she
was
ready
to
do
that
which
gulfardo
wished
provided
two
things
should
ensue
thereof
one
that
this
should
never
be
by
him
discovered
to
any
and
the
other
that
as
she
had
need
of
two
hundred
gold
florins
for
some
occasion
of
hers
he
who
was
a
rich
man
should
give
them
to
her
after
which
she
would
still
be
at
his
service
gulfardo
hearing
this
and
indignant
at
the
sordidness
of
her
whom
he
had
accounted
a
lady
of
worth
was
like
to
exchange
his
fervent
love
for
hatred
and
thinking
to
cheat
her
sent
back
to
her
saying
that
he
would
very
willingly
do
this
and
all
else
in
his
power
that
might
please
her
and
that
therefore
she
should
send
him
word
when
she
would
have
him
go
to
her
for
that
he
would
carry
her
the
money
nor
should
any
ever
hear
aught
of
the
matter
save
a
comrade
of
his
in
whom
he
trusted
greatly
and
who
still
bore
him
company
in
whatsoever
he
did
the
lady
or
rather
i
should
say
the
vile
woman
hearing
this
was
well
pleased
and
sent
to
him
saying
that
guasparruolo
her
husband
was
to
go
to
genoa
for
his
occasions
a
few
days
hence
and
that
she
would
presently
let
him
know
of
this
and
send
for
him
meanwhile
gulfardo
taking
his
opportunity
repaired
to
guasparruolo
and
said
to
him
have
present
occasion
for
two
hundred
gold
florins
the
which
i
would
have
thee
lend
me
at
that
same
usance
whereat
thou
art
wont
to
lend
me
other
monies
the
other
replied
that
he
would
well
and
straightway
counted
out
to
him
the
money
a
few
days
thereafterward
guasparruolo
went
to
genoa
even
as
the
lady
had
said
whereupon
she
sent
to
gulfardo
to
come
to
her
and
bring
the
two
hundred
gold
florins
accordingly
he
took
his
comrade
and
repaired
to
the
lady
house
where
finding
her
expecting
him
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
put
into
her
hands
the
two
hundred
gold
florins
in
his
friend
presence
saying
to
her
take
these
monies
and
give
them
to
your
husband
whenas
he
shall
be
returned
the
lady
took
them
never
guessing
why
he
said
thus
but
supposing
that
he
did
it
so
his
comrade
should
not
perceive
that
he
gave
them
to
her
by
way
of
price
and
answered
all
my
heart
but
i
would
fain
see
how
many
they
are
accordingly
she
turned
them
out
upon
the
table
and
finding
them
full
two
hundred
laid
them
up
mighty
content
in
herself
then
returning
to
gulfardo
and
carrying
him
into
her
chamber
she
satisfied
him
of
her
person
not
that
night
only
but
many
others
before
her
husband
returned
from
genoa
as
soon
as
the
latter
came
back
gulfardo
having
spied
out
a
time
when
he
was
in
company
with
his
wife
betook
himself
to
him
together
with
his
comrade
aforesaid
and
said
to
him
in
the
lady
presence
i
had
no
occasion
for
the
monies
to
wit
the
two
hundred
gold
florins
thou
lentest
me
the
other
day
for
that
i
could
not
compass
the
business
for
which
i
borrowed
them
accordingly
i
brought
them
presently
back
to
thy
lady
here
and
gave
them
to
her
wherefore
look
thou
cancel
my
account
guasparruolo
turning
to
his
wife
asked
her
if
she
had
the
monies
and
she
seeing
the
witness
present
knew
not
how
to
deny
but
said
i
had
them
and
had
not
yet
remembered
me
to
tell
thee
whereupon
quoth
guasparruolo
i
am
satisfied
get
you
gone
and
god
go
with
you
i
will
settle
your
account
aright
gulfardo
gone
the
lady
finding
herself
cozened
gave
her
husband
the
dishonourable
price
of
her
baseness
and
on
this
wise
the
crafty
lover
enjoyed
his
sordid
mistress
without
cost
the
second
story
day
the
eighth
the
parish
priest
of
varlungo
lieth
with
mistress
belcolore
and
leaveth
her
a
cloak
of
his
in
pledge
then
borrowing
a
mortar
of
her
he
sendeth
it
back
to
her
demanding
in
return
the
cloak
left
by
way
of
token
which
the
good
woman
grudgingly
giveth
him
back
men
and
ladies
alike
commended
that
which
gulfardo
had
done
to
the
sordid
milanese
lady
and
the
queen
turning
to
pamfilo
smilingly
charged
him
follow
on
whereupon
quoth
he
fair
ladies
it
occurreth
to
me
to
tell
you
a
little
story
against
those
who
continually
offend
against
us
without
being
open
to
retaliation
on
our
part
to
wit
the
clergy
who
have
proclaimed
a
crusade
against
our
wives
and
who
whenas
they
avail
to
get
one
of
the
latter
under
them
conceive
themselves
to
have
gained
forgiveness
of
fault
and
pardon
of
penalty
no
otherwise
than
as
they
had
brought
the
soldan
bound
from
alexandria
to
avignon
whereof
the
wretched
laymen
can
not
return
them
the
like
albeit
they
wreak
their
ire
upon
the
priests
mothers
and
sisters
doxies
and
daughters
assailing
them
with
no
less
ardour
than
the
former
do
their
wives
wherefore
i
purpose
to
recount
to
you
a
village
more
laughable
for
its
conclusion
than
long
in
words
wherefrom
you
may
yet
gather
by
way
of
fruit
that
priests
are

note
you

that
there
was
once
at

a
village
very
near

as
each
of

either
knoweth

may
have
heard
a
worthy
priest
and
a
lusty
of
his
person
in
the
service
of
the
ladies
who
albeit
he
knew
not
overwell
how
to

regaled
his
parishioners
with
store
of
good
and
pious
saws
at
the
elmfoot
on
sundays
and
visited
their
women
whenas
they
went
abroad

had
been
there
aforetime
carrying

fairings

holy

a

to

it
chanced
that
among

his

were
most
to

one
pleased
him
over
all
by
name
mistress
belcolore
the
wife
of
a
husbandman
who
styled
himself
bentivegna
del
mazzo
a
jolly
buxom
country
wench
and
as
apt
at
turning
the
mill
as
any
woman
alive
moreover
it
was
she
who
knew
how
to
play
the
tabret
and
sing
water
runneth
to
the
ravine
and
lead
up
the
haye
and
the
round
when
need
was
with
a
fine
muckender
in
her
hand
and
a
quaint
better
than
any
woman
of
her
neighbourhood
by
reason
of
which
things
my
lord
priest
became
so
sore
enamoured
of
her
that
he
was
like
to
lose
his
wits
therefor
and
would
prowl
about
all
day
long
to
get
a
sight
of
her
whenas
he
espied
her
in
church
of
a
sunday
morning
he
would
say
a
kyrie
and
a
sanctus
studying
to
show
himself
a
past
master
in
descant
that
it
seemed
as
it
were
an
ass
whereas
when
he
saw
her
not
there
he
passed
that
part
of
the
service
over
lightly
enough
but
yet
he
made
shift
to
do
on
such
wise
that
neither
bentivegna
nor
any
of
his
neighbours
suspected
aught
and
the
better
to
gain
mistress
belcolore
goodwill
he
made
her
presents
from
time
to
time
sending
her
whiles
a
clove
of
garlic
which
he
had
the
finest
of
all
the
countryside
in
a
garden
he
tilled
with
his
own
hands
and
otherwhiles
a
punnet
of
peascods
or
a
bunch
of
chives
or
scallions
and
whenas
he
saw
his
opportunity
he
would
ogle
her
askance
and
cast
a
friendly
gibe
at
her
but
she
putting
on
the
prude
made
a
show
of
not
observing
it
and
passed
on
with
a
demure
air
wherefore
my
lord
priest
could
not
come
by
his
will
of
her
footnote
or
as
la
fontaine
would
say
aussi
bien
faite
pour

lit
it
chanced
one
day
that
as
he
sauntered
about
the
quarter
on
the
stroke
of
noon
he
encountered
bentivegna
del
mazzo
driving
an
ass
laden
with
gear
and
accosting
him
asked
whither
he
went
sir
answered
the
husbandman
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
going
to
town
about
a
business
of
mine
and
am
carrying
these
things
to
squire
bonaccorri
da
ginestreto
so
he
may
help
me
in
i
know
not
what
whereof
the
judge
hath
summoned
me
by
his
proctor
for
a
peremptory
attendance
the
priest
was
rejoiced
to
hear
this
and
said
dost
well
my
son
go
now
with
my
benison
and
return
speedily
and
shouldst
thou
chance
to
see
lapuccio
or
naldino
forget
not
to
bid
them
bring
me
those
straps
they
wot
of
for
my
flails
bentivegna
answered
that
it
should
be
done
and
went
his
way
towards
florence
whereupon
the
priest
bethought
himself
that
now
was
his
time
to
go
try
his
luck
with
belcolore
accordingly
he
let
not
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
but
set
off
forthright
and
stayed
not
till
he
came
to
her
house
and
entering
in
said
send
us
all
well
who
is
within
there
belcolore
who
was
gone
up
into
the
hearing
him
said
sir
you
are
welcome
but
what
do
you
gadding
it
abroad
in
this
heat
god
give
me
good
luck
answered
he
came
to
abide
with
thee
awhile
for
that
i
met
thy
man
going
to
town
belcolore
came
down
and
taking
a
seat
fell
to
picking
over
which
her
husband
had
threshed
out
a
while
before
whereupon
quoth
the
priest
to
her
belcolore
wilt
thou
still
cause
me
die
for
thee
on
this
wise
she
laughed
and
answered
is
it
i
do
to
you
quoth
he
dost
nought
to
me
but
thou
sufferest
me
not
do
to
thee
that
which
i
would
fain
do
and
which
god
commandeth
cried
belcolore
to
go
to
do
priests
do
such
things
do
we
replied
he
well
as
other
men
and
why
not
and
i
tell
thee
more
we
do
far
and
away
better
work
and
knowest
thou
why
because
we
grind
with
a
full
head
of
water
but
in
good
sooth
it
shall
be
shrewdly
to
thy
profit
an
thou
wilt
but
abide
quiet
and
let
me
do
what
might
this
shrewdly
to
my
profit
be
asked
she
all
you
priests
are
stingier
than
the
devil
quoth
he
know
not
ask
thou
wilt
have
a
pair
of
shoes
or
a
or
a
fine
stammel
waistband
or
what
thou
wilt
cried
belcolore
have
enough
and
to
spare
of
such
things
but
an
you
wish
me
so
well
why
do
you
not
render
me
a
service
and
i
will
do
what
you
will
quoth
the
priest
what
thou
wilt
have
of
me
and
i
will
do
it
willingly
then
said
she
must
i
go
to
florence
come
saturday
to
carry
back
the
wool
i
have
spun
and
get
my
mended
and
an
you

i

i
can
not

after
i
will
still
do
what
you
would
have

god
give
me
a
good

replied
the
priest
have
them
not

believe
me
ere
saturday

i
will
contrive
that
thou
shalt
have
them

after
perform
nothing

you

luck
just
now

my

off

had

ill

him

the

he
fell
to
considering
how
he
might
have
it
again
without

in

he
soon
hit
upon
a
device

it
succeeded

his
wish

that
on
the
morrow

being

he
sent
a

of

to
dine
with
him
that
morning
and
he
had
a
mind
to
make
sauce
she
sent
it
to
him
and
towards
the
priest
having
spied
out
when
bentivegna
and
his
wife
were
at
meat
together
called
his
clerk
and
said
to
him
this
mortar
back
to
belcolore

say
to
her
reverence
biddeth
you
gramercy
and
prayeth
you
send
him
back
the
cloak
that
the
boy
left
you
by
way

token
the
clerk
accordingly
repaired
to
her
house
and
there
finding
her
at
table
with
bentivegna
set
down
the
mortar
and
did
the
priest
errand
belcolore
hearing
require
the
cloak
again
would
have
answered
but
her
husband
said
with
an
angry
air
thou
a
pledge
of
his
reverence
i
vow
to
christ
i
have
a
mind
to
give
thee
a
good
clout
over
the

give
it

take
thee

in

him
ask
what
he

he

it

belcolore
rose
grumbling

pulling
the
cloak
out

it
to
the

made
off
with

her

her
when
thou

her
that

me

will

her
my

so
we

bentivegna
concluded
that
his
wife
had
said
this
because
he
had
chidden
her
and
took
no
heed
thereof
but
belcolore
bore
the
priest
a
grudge
and

him
at

i
will
do
my
endeavor
thereof
in
our
city
then
which
hath
ever
abounded
in
various
fashions
and
strange
folk
there
was
once
no
great
while
since
a
painter
called
calandrino
a
man
and
of
strange
usances
he
companied
most
of
his
time
with
other
two
painters
called
the
one
bruno
and
the
other
buffalmacco
both
very
merry
men
but
otherwise
and
shrewd
who
consorted
with
calandrino
for
that
they
ofttimes
had
great
diversion
of
his
fashions
and
his
simplicity
there
was
then
also
in
florence
a
young
man
of
a
mighty
pleasant
humor
and
marvellously
adroit
in
all
he
had
a
mind
to
do
astute
and
plausible
who
was
called
maso
del
saggio
and
who
hearing
certain
traits
of
calandrino
simplicity
determined
to
amuse
himself
at
his
expense
by
putting
off
some
cheat
on
him
or
causing
him
believe
some
strange
thing
he
chanced
one
day
to
come
upon
him
in
the
church
of
san
giovanni
and
seeing
him
intent
upon
the
carved
work
and
paintings
of
the
pyx
which
is
upon
the
altar
of
the
said
church
and
which
had
then
not
long
been
placed
there
he
judged
the
place
and
time
opportune
for
carrying
his
intent
into
execution
accordingly
acquainting
a
friend
of
his
with
that
which
he
purposed
to
do
they
both
drew
near
unto
the
place
where
calandrino
sat
alone
and
feigning
not
to
see
him
fell
together
of
the
virtues
of
divers
stones
whereof
maso
spoke
as
authoritatively
as
if
he
had
been
a
great
and
famous
lapidary
calandrino
gave
ear
to
their
talk
and
presently
seeing
that
it
was
no
secret
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
joined
himself
to
them
to
the
no
small
satisfaction
of
maso
who
pursuing
his
discourse
was
asked
by
calandrino
where
these
stones
were
to
be
found
maso
replied
that
the
most
of
them
were
found
in
berlinzone
a
city
of
the
basques
in
a
country
called
bengodi
where
the
vines
are
tied
up
with
sausages
and
a
goose
is
to
be
had
for
a
farthing
and
a
gosling
into
the
bargain

that
there
was
a
mountain

of
grated
parmesan

abode

who
did
nothing
but
make
maccaroni
and
ravioli

cook
them

them
down
thence

got
most
thereof

tell
me
what
is
done
with
the
capons

said
is
overfar
for
my
money
though
were
it
nearer
i
tell
thee
aright
i
would
go
thither
with
thee
once
upon
a
time
if
but
to
see
the
maccaroni
come
tumbling
headlong
down
and
take
my
fill
thereof
but
tell
me
god
keep
thee
merry
is
there
none
of
those
stones
to
be
found
in
these
parts
is
there
answered
maso
be
two
kinds
of
stones
of
very
great
virtue
found
here
the
first
are
the
grits
of
settignano
and
montisci
by
virtue
whereof
when
they
are
wrought
into
millstones
flour
is
made
wherefore
it
is
said
in
those
parts
that
grace
cometh
from
god
and
millstones
from
montisci
but
there
is
such
great
plenty
of
these
grits
that
they
are
as
little
prized
with
us
as
emeralds
with
the
folk
over
yonder
where
they
have
mountains
of
them
bigger
than
mount
morello
which
shine
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
warrant
thee
and
thou
must
know
that
whoso
should
cause
set
fine
and
perfect
millstones
before
they
are
pierced
in
rings
and
carry
them
to
the
soldan
might
have
for
them
what
he
would
the
other
is
what
we
lapidaries
call
heliotrope
a
stone
of
exceeding
great
virtue
for
that
whoso
hath
it
about
him
is
not
seen
of
any
other
person
whereas
he
is
not
what
while
he
holdeth
it
quoth
calandrino
be
indeed
great
virtues
but
where
is
this
second
stone
found
to
which
maso
replied
that
it
was
commonly
found
in
the
mugnone
bigness
is
this
stone
asked
calandrino
what
is
its
colour
quoth
maso
is
of
various
sizes
some
more
and
some
less
but
all
are
well
nigh
black
of
colour
calandrino
noted
all
this
in
himself
and
feigning
to
have
otherwhat
to
do
took
leave
of
maso
inwardly
determined
to
go
seek
the
stone
in
question
but
bethought
himself
not
to
do
it
without
the
knowledge
of
bruno
and
buffalmacco
whom
he
most
particularly
affected
accordingly
he
addressed
himself
to
seek
for
them
so
they
might
without
delay
and
before
any
else
set
about
the
search
and
spent
all
the
rest
of
the
morning
seeking
them
at
last
when
it
was
past
none
he
remembered
him
that
they
were
awork
in
the
ladies
convent
at
faenza
and
leaving
all
his
other
business
he
betook
himself
thither
well
nigh
at
a
run
notwithstanding
the
great
heat
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
he
called
them
and
bespoke
them
thus
an
you
will
hearken
to
me
we
may
become
the
richest
men
in
all
florence
for
that
i
have
learned
from
a
man
worthy
of
belief
that
in
the
mugnone
is
to
be
found
a
stone
which
whoso
carrieth
about
him
is
not
seen
of
any
wherefore
meseemeth
we
were
best
go
thither
in
quest
thereof
without
delay
ere
any
forestall
us
we
shall
certainly
find
it
for
that
i
know
it
well
and
when
we
have
gotten
it
what
have
we
to
do
but
put
it
in
our
poke
and
getting
us
to
the
moneychangers
tables
which
you
know
stand
still
laden
with
groats
and
florins
take
as
much
as
we
will
thereof
none
will
see
us
and
so
may
we
grow
rich
of
a
sudden
without
having
to
smear
walls
all
day
long
bruno
and
buffalmacco
hearing
this
fell
in
their
sleeves
and
eyeing
each
other
askance
made
a
show
of
exceeding
wonderment
and
praised
calandrino
counsel
but
bruno
asked
how
the
stone
in
question
was
called
calandrino
who
was
a
fellow
had
already
forgotten
the
name
wherefore
quoth
he
have
we
to
do
with
the
name
since
we
know
the
virtue
of
the
stone
meseemeth
we
were
best
go
about
the
quest
without
more
ado
then
said
bruno
is
it
fashioned
is
of
all
fashions
replied
calandrino
all
are
well
nigh
black
wherefore
meseemeth
that
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
gather
up
all
the
black
stones
we
see
till
we
happen
upon
the
right
so
let
us
lose
no
time
but
get
us
gone
quoth
bruno
awhile
and
turning
to
his
comrade
said
calandrino
saith
well
but
meseemeth
this
is
no
season
for
the
search
for
that
the
sun
is
high
and
shineth
full
upon
the
mugnone
where
it
hath
dried
all
the
stones
so
that
certain
of
those
that
be
there
appear
presently
white
which
of
a
morning
ere
the
sun
have
dried
them
show
black
more
by
token
that
being
a
working
day
there
be
many
folk
on
one
occasion
or
another
abroad
along
the
banks
who
seeing
us
may
guess
what
we
are
about
and
maybe
do
likewise
whereby
the
stone
may
come
to
their
hands
and
we
shall
have
lost
the
trot
for
the
amble
meseemeth
an
you
be
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
that
this
is
a
business
to
be
undertaken
of
a
morning
whenas
the
black
may
be
the
better
known
from
the
white
and
of
a
holiday
when
there
will
be
none
there
to
see
us
buffalmacco
commended
bruno
counsel
and
calandrino
fell
in
therewith
wherefore
they
agreed
to
go
seek
for
the
stone
all
three
on
the
following
sunday
morning
and
calandrino
besought
them
over
all
else
not
to
say
a
word
of
the
matter
to
any
one
alive
for
that
it
had
been
imparted
to
him
in
confidence
and
after
told
them
that
which
he
had
heard
tell
of
the
land
of
bengodi
affirming
with
an
oath
that
it
was
as
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
leave
the
two
others
agreed
with
each
other
what
they
should
do
in
the
matter
and
calandrino
impatiently
awaited
the
sunday
morning
which
being
come
he
arose
at
break
of
day
and
called
his
friends
with
whom
he
sallied
forth
of
the
city
by
the
san
gallo
gate
and
descending
into
the
bed
of
the
mugnone
began
to
go
searching
down
stream
for
the
stone
calandrino
as
the
eagerest
of
the
three
went
on
before
skipping
nimbly
hither
and
thither
and
whenever
he
espied
any
black
stone
he
pounced
upon
it
and
picking
it
up
thrust
it
into
his
bosom
his
comrades
followed
after
him
picking
up
now
one
stone
and
now
another
but
calandrino
had
not
gone
far
before
he
had
his
bosom
full
of
stones
wherefore
gathering
up
the
skirts
of
his
grown
which
was
not
cut
flanders
fashion
he
tucked
them
well
into
his
surcingle
all
round
and
made
an
ample
lap
thereof
however
it
was
no
great
while
ere
he
had
filled
it
and
making
a
lap
on
like
wise
of
his
mantle
soon
filled
this
also
with
stones
presently
the
two
others
seeing
that
he
had
gotten
his
load
and
that
drew
nigh
quoth
bruno
to
buffalmacco
in
accordance
with
the
plan
concerted
between
them
is
calandrino
buffalmacco
who
saw
him
hard
by
turned
about
and
looking
now
here
and
now
there
answered
know
not
but
he
was
before
us
but
now
now
quotha
cried
bruno
warrant
you
he
is
presently
at
home
at
dinner
and
hath
left
us
to
play
the
fool
here
seeking
black
stones
down
the
mugnone
rejoined
buffalmacco
hath
done
well
to
make
mock
of
us
and
leave
us
here
since
we
were
fools
enough
to
credit
him
marry
who
but
we
had
been
simple
enough
to
believe
that
a
stone
of
such
virtue
was
to
be
found
in
the
mugnone
footnote
not
calandrino
hearing
this
concluded
that
the
heliotrope
had
fallen
into
his
hands
and
that
by
virtue
thereof
they
saw
him
not
albeit
he
was
present
with
them
and
rejoiced
beyond
measure
at
such
a
piece
of
good
luck
answered
them
not
a
word
but
determined
to
return
wherefore
turning
back
he
set
off
homeward
buffalmacco
seeing
this
said
to
bruno
shall
we
do
why
do
we
not
get
us
gone
whereto
bruno
answered
us
begone
but
i
vow
to
god
that
calandrino
shall
never
again
serve
me
thus
and
were
i
presently
near
him
as
i
have
been
all
the
morning
i
would
give
him
such
a
clout
on
the
shins
with
this
stone
that
he
should
have
cause
to
remember
this
trick
for
maybe
a
month
to
come
to
say
this
and
to
let
fly
at
calandrino
shins
with
the
stone
were
one
and
the
same
thing
and
the
latter
feeling
the
pain
lifted
up
his
leg
and
began
to
puff
and
blow
but
yet
held
his
peace
and
fared
on
presently
buffalmacco
took
one
of
the
flints
he
had
picked
up
and
said
to
bruno
at
this
fine
flint
here
should
go
for
calandrino
loins
so
saying
he
let
fly
and
dealt
him
a
sore
rap
in
the
small
of
the
back
with
the
stone
brief
on
this
wise
now
with
one
word
and
now
with
another
they
went
pelting
him
up
the
mugnone
till
they
came
to
the
san
gallo
gate
where
they
threw
down
the
stones
they
had
gathered
and
halted
awhile
at
the
custom
house
the
officers
forewarned
by
them
feigned
not
to
see
calandrino
and
let
him
pass
laughing
heartily
at
the
jest
whilst
he
without
stopping
made
straight
for
his
house
which
was
near
the
canto
alla
macina
and
fortune
so
far
favoured
the
cheat
that
none
accosted
him
as
he
came
up
the
stream
and
after
through
the
city
as
indeed
he
met
with
few
for
that
well
nigh
every
one
was
at
dinner
accordingly
he
reached
his
house
thus
laden
and
as
chance
would
have
it
his
wife
a
fair
and
virtuous
lady
by
name
mistress
tessa
was
at
the
stairhead
seeing
him
come
and
somewhat
provoked
at
his
long
tarriance
she
began
to
rail
at
him
saying
take
the
man
wilt
thou
never
think
to
come
home
betimes
all
the
folk
have
already
dined
whenas
thou
comest
back
to
dinner
calandrino
hearing
this
and
finding
that
he
was
seen
was
overwhelmed
with
chagrin
and
vexation
and
cried
out
wicked
woman
that
thou
art
wast
thou
there
thou
hast
undone
me
but
by
god
his
faith
i
will
pay
thee
therefor
therewithal
he
ran
up
to
a
little
saloon
he
had
and
there
disburdened
himself
of
the
mass
of
stones
he
had
brought
home
then
running
in
a
fury
at
his
wife
he
laid
hold
of
her
by
the
hair
and
throwing
her
down
at
his
feet
cuffed
and
kicked
her
in
every
part
as
long
as
he
could
wag
his
arms
and
legs
without
leaving
a
hair
on
her
head
or
a
bone
in
her
body
that
was
not
beaten
to
a
mash
nor
did
it
avail
her
aught
to
cry
him
mercy
with
clasped
hands
meanwhile
bruno
and
buffalmacco
after
laughing
awhile
with
the
keepers
of
the
gate
proceeded
with
slow
step
to
follow
calandrino
afar
off
and
presently
coming
to
the
door
of
his
house
heard
the
cruel
beating
he
was
in
act
to
give
his
wife
whereupon
making
a
show
of
having
but
then
come
back
they
called
calandrino
who
came
to
the
window
all
asweat
and
red
with
anger
and
vexation
and
prayed
them
come
up
to
him
accordingly
they
went
up
making
believe
to
be
somewhat
vexed
and
seeing
the
room
full
of
stones
and
the
lady
all
torn
and
dishevelled
and
black
and
blue
in
the
face
for
bruises
weeping
piteously
in
one
corner
of
the
room
whilst
calandrino
sat
in
another
untrussed
and
panting
like
one
forspent
eyed
them
awhile
then
said
is
this
calandrino
art
thou
for
building
that
we
see
all
these
stones
here
and
mistress
tessa
what
aileth
her
it
seemeth
thou
hast
beaten
her
what
is
all
this
ado
calandrino
outwearied
with
the
weight
of
the
stones
and
the
fury
with
which
he
had
beaten
his
wife
no
less
than
with
chagrin
for
the
luck
which
himseemed
he
had
lost
could
not
muster
breath
to
give
them
aught
but
broken
words
in
reply
wherefore
as
he
delayed
to
answer
buffalmacco
went
on
calandrino
whatever
other
cause
for
anger
thou
mightest
have
had
thou
shouldst
not
have
fooled
us
as
thou
hast
done
in
that
after
thou
hadst
carried
us
off
to
seek
with
thee
for
the
stone
thou
leftest
us
in
the
mugnone
like
a
couple
of
gulls
and
madest
off
home
without
saying
so
much
as
god
be
with
you
or
devil
the
which
we
take
exceeding
ill
but
assuredly
this
shall
be
the
last
trick
thou
shalt
ever
play
us
therewithal
calandrino
enforcing
himself
answered
be
not
angered
the
case
standeth
otherwise
than
as
you
deem
i
unlucky
wretch
that
i
am
had
found
the
stone
in
question
and
you
shall
hear
if
i
tell
truth
when
first
you
questioned
one
another
of
me
i
was
less
than
half
a
score
yards
distant
from
you
but
seeing
that
you
made
off
and
saw
me
not
i
went
on
before
you
and
came
back
hither
still
keeping
a
little
in
front
of
you
then
beginning
from
the
beginning
he
recounted
to
them
all
that
they
had
said
and
done
first
and
last
and
showed
them
how
the
stones
had
served
his
back
and
shins
after
which
i
may
tell
you
continued
he
whenas
i
entered
in
at
the
gate
with
all
these
stones
about
me
which
you
see
here
there
was
nothing
said
to
me
albeit
you
know
how
vexatious
and
tiresome
these
gatekeepers
use
to
be
in
wanting
to
see
everything
more
by
token
that
i
met
by
the
way
several
of
my
friends
and
gossips
who
are
still
wont
to
accost
me
and
invite
me
to
drink
but
none
of
them
said
a
word
to
me
no
nor
half
a
word
as
those
who
saw
me
not
at
last
being
come
home
hither
this
accursed
devil
of
a
woman
presented
herself
before
me
for
that
as
you
know
women
cause
everything
lose
its
virtue
wherefore
i
who
might
else
have
called
myself
the
luckiest
man
in
florence
am
become
the
most
unlucky
for
this
i
have
beaten
her
as
long
as
i
could
wag
my
fists
and
i
know
not
what
hindereth
me
from
slitting
her
weasand
accursed
be
the
hour
when
first
i
saw
her
and
when
she
came
to
me
in
this
house
then
flaming
out
into
fresh
anger
he
offered
to
rise
and
beat
her
anew
footnote
recovering
his
wind
with
an
effort
bruno
and
buffalmacco
hearing
all
this
made
believe
to
marvel
exceedingly
and
often
confirmed
that
which
calandrino
said
albeit
they
had
the
while
so
great
a
mind
to
laugh
that
they
were
like
to
burst
but
seeing
him
start
up
in
a
rage
to
beat
his
wife
again
they
rose
upon
him
and
withheld
him
avouching
that
the
lady
was
nowise
at
fault
but
that
he
had
only
himself
to
blame
for
that
which
had
happened
since
he
knew
that
women
caused
things
to
lose
their
virtue
and
had
not
bidden
her
beware
of
appearing
before
him
that
day
and
that
god
had
bereft
him
of
foresight
to
provide
against
this
either
for
that
the
adventure
was
not
to
be
his
or
because
he
had
had
it
in
mind
to
cozen
his
comrades
to
whom
he
should
have
discovered
the
matter
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
he
had
found
the
stone
brief
after
many
words
they
made
peace
not
without
much
ado
between
him
and
the
woebegone
lady
and
went
their
ways

him
disconsolate

have
not
forgotten
noble
ladies
that
it
hath
already
been
shown
in
sundry
of
the
foregoing
stories
how
much
we
women
are
exposed
to
the
importunities
of
the
priests
and
friars
and
clergy
of
every
kind
but
seeing
that
so
much
can
not
be
said
thereof
but
that
yet
more
will
remain
to
say
i
purpose
to
boot
to
tell
you
a
story
of
a
rector
who
maugre
all
the
world
would
have
a
gentlewoman
wish
him
well
whether
she
would
or
not
whereupon
she
like
a
very
discreet
woman
as
she
was
used
him
as
he
deserved
footnote
love
him
grant
him
her
favours
see
ante
passim
as
all
of
you
know
fiesole
whose
hill
we
can
see
hence
was
once
a
very
great
and
ancient
city
nor
albeit
it
is
nowadays
all
undone
hath
it
ever
ceased
to
be
as
it
is
yet
the
seat
of
a
bishop
near
the
cathedral
church
there
a
widow
lady
of
noble
birth
by
name
madam
piccarda
had
an
estate
where
for
that
she
was
not
overwell
to
do
she
abode
the
most
part
of
the
year
in
a
house
of
hers
that
was
not
very
big
and
with
her
two
brothers
of
hers
very
courteous
and
worthy
youths
it
chanced
that
the
lady
frequenting
the
cathedral
church
and
being
yet
very
young
and
fair
and
agreeable
the
rector
of
the
church
became
so
sore
enamoured
of
her
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
after
awhile
making
bold
to
discover
his
mind
to
her
he
prayed
her
accept
of
his
love
and
love
him
as
he
loved
her
now
he
was
already
old
in
years
but
very
young
in
wit
malapert
and
arrogant
and
presumptuous
in
the
extreme
with
manners
and
fashions
full
of
conceit
and
ill
grace
and
withal
so
froward
and
that
there
was
none
who
wished
him
well
and
if
any
had
scant
regard
for
him
it
was
the
lady
in
question
who
not
only
wished
him
no
whit
of
good
but
hated
him
worse
than
the
megrims
wherefore
like
a
discreet
woman
as
she
was
she
answered
him
that
you
love
me
should
be
mighty
pleasing
to
me
who
am
bound
to
love
you
and
will
gladly
do
so
but
between
your
love
and
mine
nothing
unseemly
should
ever
befall
you
are
my
spiritual
father
and
a
priest
and
are
presently
well
stricken
in
years
all
which
things
should
make
you
both
modest
and
chaste
whilst
i
on
the
other
hand
am
no
girl
nor
do
these
amorous
toys
beseem
my
present
condition
for
that
i
am
a
widow
and
you
well
know
what
discretion
is
required
in
widows
wherefore
i
pray
you
hold
me
excused
for
that
i
shall
never
love
you
after
the
fashion
whereof
you
require
me
nor
do
i
wish
to
be
thus
loved
of
you
the
rector
could
get
of
her
no
other
answer
for
that
time
but
nowise
daunted
or
disheartened
by
the
first
rebuff
solicited
her
again
and
again
with
the
most
overweening
importunity
both
by
letter
and
message
nay
even
by
word
of
mouth
whenas
he
saw
her
come
into
the
church
wherefor
herseeming
that
this
was
too
great
and
too
grievous
an
annoy
she
cast
about
to
rid
herself
of
him
after
such
a
fashion
as
he
deserved
since
she
could
no
otherwise
but
would
do
nought
ere
she
had
taken
counsel
with
her
brothers
accordingly
she
acquainted
them
with
the
rector
behaviour
towards
her
and
that
which
she
purposed
to
do
and
having
therein
full
license
from
them
went
a
few
days
after
to
the
church
as
was
her
wont
as
soon
as
the
rector
saw
her
he
came
up
to
her
and
with
his
usual
assurance
accosted
her
familiarly
the
lady
received
him
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
withdrawing
apart
with
him
after
he
had
said
many
words
to
her
in
his
wonted
style
she
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
said
i
have
heard
that
there
is
no
fortalice
so
strong
but
that
being
every
day
assaulted
it
cometh
at
last
to
be
taken
and
this
i
can
very
well
see
to
have
happened
to
myself
for
that
you
have
so
closely
beset
me
with
soft
words
and
with
one
complaisance
and
another
that
you
have
made
me
break
my
resolve
and
i
am
now
disposed
since
i
please
you
thus
to
consent
to
be
yours
madam
answered
the
rector
overjoyed
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
often
wondered
how
you
could
hold
out
so
long
considering
that
never
did
the
like
betide
me
with
any
woman
nay
i
have
said
whiles
were
women
of
silver
they
would
not
be
worth
a
farthing
for
that
not
one
of
them
would
stand
the
hammer
but
let
that
pass
for
the
present
when
and
where
can
we
be
together
whereto
quoth
the
lady
my
lord
as
for
the
when
it
may
be
what
time
soever
most
pleaseth
us
for
that
i
have
no
husband
to
whom
it
behoveth
me
render
an
account
of
my
nights
but
for
the
where
i
know
not
how
to
contrive
cried
the
priest
in
your
house
to
be
sure
answered
the
lady
know
i
have
two
young
brothers
who
come
and
go
about
the
house
with
their
companions
day
and
night
and
my
house
is
not
overbig
wherefore
it
may
not
be
there
except
one
chose
to
abide
there
without
saying
a
word
or
making
the
least
sound
and
be
in
the
dark
after
the
manner
of
the
blind
an
you
be
content
to
do
this
it
might
be
for
they
meddle
not
with
my
bedchamber
but
their
own
is
so
close
to
mine
that
one
can
not
whisper
the
least
word
without
its
being
heard
answered
the
rector
shall
not
hinder
us
for
a
night
or
two
against
i
bethink
me
where
we
may
foregather
more
at
ease
quoth
she
let
that
rest
with
you
but
of
one
thing
i
pray
you
that
this
abide
secret
so
no
word
be
ever
known
thereof
replied
he
no
fear
for
that
but
an
it
may
be
make
shift
that
we
shall
foregather
this
evening
all
my
heart
said
the
lady
and
appointing
him
how
and
when
he
should
come
she
took
leave
of
him
and
returned
home
now
she
had
a
who
was
not
overyoung
but
had
the
foulest
and
visnomy
was
ever
seen
for
she
had
a
nose
flattened
sore
a
mouth
all
awry
thick
lips
and
great
teeth
moreover
she
inclined
to
squint
nor
was
ever
without
sore
eyes
and
had
a
green
and
yellow
complexion
which
gave
her
the
air
of
having
passed
the
summer
not
at
fiesole
but
at
sinigaglia
besides
all
this
she
was
hipshot
and
a
thought
crooked
on
the
right
side
her
name
was
ciuta
but
for
that
she
had
such
a
dog
visnomy
of
her
own
she
was
called
of
every
one
ciutazza
and
for
all
she
was
misshapen
of
her
person
she
was
not
without
a
spice
of
roguishness
the
lady
called
her
and
said
to
her
ciutazza
an
thou
wilt
do
me
a
service
this
night
i
will
give
thee
a
fine
new
shift
ciutazza
hearing
speak
of
the
shift
answered
so
you
give
me
a
shift
i
will
cast
myself
into
the
fire
let
alone
otherwhat
then
said
her
mistress
would
have
thee
lie
with
a
man
in
my
bed
and
load
him
with
caresses
but
take
good
care
not
to
say
a
word
lest
thou
be
heard
by
my
brothers
who
as
thou
knowest
sleep
in
the
next
room
and
after
i
will
give
thee
the
shift
quoth
ciutazza
all
my
heart
i
will
lie
with
half
a
dozen
men
if
need
be
let
alone
one
accordingly
at
nightfall
my
lord
the
rector
made
his
appearance
according
to
agreement
whilst
the
two
young
men
by
the
lady
appointment
were
in
their
bedchamber
and
took
good
care
to
make
themselves
heard
wherefore
he
entered
the
lady
chamber
in
silence
and
darkness
and
betook
himself
as
she
had
bidden
him
straight
to
the
bed
whither
on
her
part
came
ciutazza
who
had
been
well
lessoned
by
the
lady
of
that
which
she
had
to
do
my
lord
rector
thinking
he
had
his
mistress
beside
him
caught
ciutazza
in
his
arms
and
fell
to
kissing
her
without
saying
a
word
and
she
him
whereupon
he
proceeded
to
solace
himself
with
her
taking
as
he
thought
possession
of
the
good
footnote
in
the
malaria
district
footnote
great
ugly
ciuta
the
lady
having
done
this
charged
her
brothers
carry
the
rest
of
the
plot
into
execution
wherefore
stealing
softly
out
of
the
chamber
they
made
for
the
great
square
and
fortune
was
more
favorable
to
them
than
they
themselves
asked
in
that
which
they
had
a
mind
to
do
inasmuch
as
the
heat
being
great
the
bishop
had
enquired
for
the
two
young
gentlemen
so
he
might
go
to
their
house
and
drink
with
them
but
seeing
them
coming
he
acquainted
them
with
his
wish
and
returned
with
them
to
their
house
where
entering
a
cool
little
courtyard
of
theirs
in
which
were
many
flambeaux
alight
he
drank
with
great
pleasure
of
an
excellent
wine
of
theirs
when
he
had
drunken
the
young
men
said
to
him
lord
since
you
have
done
us
so
much
favour
as
to
deign
to
visit
this
our
poor
house
whereto
we
came
to
invite
you
we
would
have
you
be
pleased
to
view
a
small
matter
with
which
we
would
fain
show
you
the
bishop
answered
that
he
would
well
whereupon
one
of
the
young
men
taking
a
lighted
flambeau
in
his
hand
made
for
the
chamber
where
my
lord
rector
lay
with
ciutazza
followed
by
the
bishop
and
all
the
rest
the
rector
to
arrive
the
quicklier
at
his
journey
end
had
hastened
to
take
horse
and
had
already
ridden
more
than
three
miles
before
they
came
thither
wherefore
being
somewhat
weary
he
had
notwithstanding
the
heat
fallen
asleep
with
ciutazza
in
his
arms
accordingly
when
the
young
man
entered
the
chamber
light
in
hand
and
after
him
the
bishop
and
all
the
others
he
was
shown
to
the
prelate
in
this
plight
whereupon
he
awoke
and
seeing
the
light
and
the
folk
about
him
was
sore
abashed
and
hid
his
head
for
fear
under
the
the
bishop
gave
him
a
sound
rating
and
made
him
put
out
his
head
and
see
with
whom
he
had
lain
whereupon
the
rector
understanding
the
trick
that
had
been
played
him
of
the
lady
what
with
this
and
what
with
the
disgrace
himseemed
he
had
gotten
became
of
a
sudden
the
woefullest
man
that
was
aye
then
having
by
the
bishop
commandment
reclad
himself
he
was
despatched
to
his
house
under
good
guard
to
suffer
sore
penance
for
the
sin
he
had
committed
the
bishop
presently
enquiring
how
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
gone
thither
to
lie
with
ciutazza
the
young
men
orderly
related
everything
to
him
which
having
heard
he
greatly
commended
both
the
lady
and
her
brothers
for
that
without
choosing
to
imbrue
their
hands
in
the
blood
of
a
priest
they
had
entreated
him
as
he
deserved
as
for
the
rector
he
caused
him
bewail
his
offence
forty
days
space
but
love
and
despite
made
him
rue
it
for
more
than
more
by
token
that
for
a
great
while
after
he
could
never
go
abroad
but
the
children
would
point
at
him
and
say
there
is
he
who
lay
with
ciutazza
the
which
was
so
sore
an
annoy
to
him
that
he
was
like
to
go
mad
therefor
on
such
wise
did
the
worthy
lady
rid
herself
of
the
importunity
of
the
malapert
rector
and
ciutazza
gained
the
shift

leave
a
story
i
purposed
to
tell

so
i
may
relate
to
you
one
of
him
and
certain
companions
of
his
which
if

unseemly
it
offer
certain
expressions
which
you
think

use
is
natheless
so
laughable
that
i
will
tell
it
as
you
may
all
have
heard
there
come
oftentimes
to
our
city
governors
from
the
marches
of
ancona
who
are
commonly
folk
and
so
paltry
and
sordid
of
life
that
their
every
fashion
seemeth
nought
other
than
a
lousy
cadger
trick
and
of
this
innate
paltriness
and
avarice
they
bring
with
them
judges
and
notaries
who
seem
men
taken
from
the
or
the
cobbler
stall
rather
than
from
the
schools
of
law
now
one
of
these
being
come
hither
for
provost
among
the
many
judges
whom
he
brought
with
him
was
one
who
styled
himself
messer
niccola
da
san
lepidio
and
who
had
more
the
air
of
a
tinker
than
of
aught
else
and
he
was
set
with
other
judges
to
hear
criminal
causes
as
it
oft
happeneth
that
for
all
the
townsfolk
have
nought
in
the
world
to
do
at
the
courts
of
law
yet
bytimes
they
go
thither
it
befell
that
maso
del
saggio
went
thither
one
morning
in
quest
of
a
friend
of
his
and
chancing
to
cast
his
eyes
whereas
this
said
messer
niccola
sat
himseemed
that
here
was
a
rare
outlandish
kind
of
wild
fowl
accordingly
he
went
on
to
examine
him
from
head
to
foot
and
albeit
he
saw
him
with
the
miniver
bonnet
on
his
head
all
black
with
smoke
and
grease
and
a
paltry
inkhorn
at
his
girdle
a
gown
longer
than
his
mantle
and
store
of
other
things
all
foreign
to
a
man
of
good
breeding
and
manners
yet
of
all
these
the
most
notable
to
his
thinking
was
a
pair
of
breeches
the
backside
whereof
as
the
judge
sat
with
his
clothes
standing
open
in
front
for
straitness
he
perceived
came
halfway
down
his
legs
thereupon
without
tarrying
longer
to
look
upon
him
he
left
him
with
whom
he
went
seeking
and
beginning
a
new
quest
presently
found
two
comrades
of
his
called
one
ribi
and
the
other
matteuzzo
men
much
of
the
same
mad
humour
as
himself
and
said
to
them
you
tender
me
come
with
me
to
the
law
courts
for
i
wish
to
show
you
the
rarest
scarecrow
you
ever
saw
accordingly
carrying
them
to
the
court
house
he
showed
them
the
aforesaid
judge
and
his
breeches
whereat
they
fell
as
soon
as
they
caught
sight
of
him
afar
off
then
drawing
nearer
to
the
platform
whereon
my
lord
judge
sat
they
saw
that
one
might
lightly
pass
thereunder
and
that
moreover
the
boards
under
his
feet
were
so
broken
that
one
might
with
great
ease
thrust
his
hand
and
arm
between
them
whereupon
quoth
maso
to
his
comrades
must
we
pull
him
off
those
breeches
of
his
altogether
for
that
it
may
very
well
be
done
each
of
the
others
had
already
seen
how
wherefore
having
agreed
among
themselves
what
they
should
say
and
do
they
returned
thither
next
morning
when
the
court
being
very
full
of
folk
matteuzzo
without
being
seen
of
any
crept
under
the
bench
and
posted
himself
immediately
beneath
the
judge
feet
meanwhile
maso
came
up
to
my
lord
judge
on
one
side
and
taking
him
by
the
skirt
of
his
gown
whilst
ribi
did
the
like
on
the
other
side
began
to
say
lord
my
lord
i
pray
you
for
god
sake
ere
yonder
scurvy
thief
on
the
other
side
of
you
go
elsewhere
make
him
restore
me
a
pair
of
whereof
he
hath
saith
indeed
he
did
it
not
but
i
saw
him
not
a
month
ago
in
act
to
have
them
resoled
ribi
on
his
side
cried
out
with
all
his
might
him
not
my
lord
he
is
an
arrant
knave
and
for
that
he
knoweth
i
am
come
to
lay
a
complaint
against
him
for
a
pair
of
whereof
he
hath
robbed
me
he
cometh
now
with
his
story
of
the
boothose
which
i
have
had
in
my
house
this
many
a
day
an
you
believe
me
not
i
can
bring
you
to
witness
my
neighbor
trecca
and
grassa
the
tripewoman
and
one
who
goeth
gathering
the
sweepings
from
santa
masia
at
verjaza
who
saw
him
when
he
came
back
from
the
country
footnote
how
they
might
do
this
maso
on
the
other
hand
suffered
not
ribi
to
speak
but
bawled
his
loudest
whereupon
the
other
but
shouted
the
more
the
judge
stood
up
and
leaned
towards
them
so
he
might
the
better
apprehend
what
they
had
to
say
wherefore
matteuzzo
watching
his
opportunity
thrust
his
hand
between
the
crack
of
the
boards
and
laying
hold
of
messer
niccola
galligaskins
by
the
breech
tugged
at
them
amain
the
breeches
came
down
incontinent
for
that
the
judge
was
lean
and
lank
of
the
crupper
whereupon
feeling
this
and
knowing
not
what
it
might
be
he
would
have
sat
down
again
and
pulled
his
skirts
forward
to
cover
himself
but
maso
on
the
one
side
and
ribi
on
the
other
still
held
him
fast
and
cried
out
lord
you
do
ill
not
to
do
me
justice
and
to
seek
to
avoid
hearing
me
and
get
you
gone
otherwhere
there
be
no
writs
granted
in
this
city
for
such
small
matters
as
this
so
saying
they
held
him
fast
by
the
clothes
on
such
wise
that
all
who
were
in
the
court
perceived
that
his
breeches
had
been
pulled
down
however
matteuzzo
after
he
had
held
them
awhile
let
them
go
and
coming
forth
from
under
the
platform
made
off
out
of
the
court
and
went
his
way
without
being
seen
whereupon
quoth
ribi
himseeming
he
had
done
enough
vow
to
god
i
will
appeal
to
the
syndicate
whilst
maso
on
his
part
let
go
the
mantle
and
said
i
will
come
hither
again
and
again
until
such
time
as
i
find
you
not
hindered
as
you
seem
to
be
this
morning
so
saying
they
both
made
off
as
quickliest
they
might
each
on
his
own
side
whilst
my
lord
judge
pulled
up
his
breeches
in
every
one
presence
as
if
he
were
arisen
from
sleep
then
perceiving
how
the
case
stood
he
enquired
whither
they
were
gone
who
were
at
difference
anent
the
boothose
and
the
but
they
were
not
to
be
found
whereupon
he
began
to
swear
by
cock
bowels
that
need
must
he
know
and
learn
if
it
were
the
wont
at
florence
to
pull
down
the
judges
breeches
whenas
they
sat
on
the
judicial
bench
the
provost
on
his
part
hearing
of
this
made
a
great
stir
but
his
friends
having
shown
him
that
this
had
only
been
done
to
give
him
notice
that
the
florentines
right
well
understood
how
whereas
he
should
have
brought
judges
he
had
brought
them
sorry
patches
to
have
them
better
cheap
he
thought
it
best
to
hold
his
peace
and
so
the
thing
went
no
farther
for
the
nonce
the
sixth
story
day
the
eighth
bruno
and
buffalmacco
having
stolen
a
pig
from
calandrino
make
him
try
the
ordeal
with
ginger
boluses
and
sack
and
give
him
instead
of
the
ginger
two
compounded
with
aloes
whereby
it
appeareth
that
he
himself
hath
had
the
pig
and
they
make
him
pay
blackmail
an
he
would
not
have
them
tell
his
wife
no
sooner
had
filostrato
despatched
his
story
which
had
given
rise
to
many
a
laugh
than
the
queen
bade
filomena
follow
on
whereupon
she
began
gracious
ladies
even
as
filostrato
was
led
by
the
mention
of
maso
to
tell
the
story
which
you
have
just
heard
from
him
so
neither
more
nor
less
am
i
moved
by
that
of
calandrino
and
his
friends
to
tell
you
another
of
them
which
methinketh
will
please
you
who
calandrino
bruno
and
buffalmacco
were
i
need
not
explain
to
you
for
that
you
have
already
heard
it
well
enough
wherefore
to
proceed
with
my
story
i
must
tell
you
that
calandrino
owned
a
little
farm
at
no
great
distance
from
florence
that
he
had
had
to
his
wife
dowry
from
this
farm
amongst
other
things
that
he
got
thence
he
had
every
year
a
pig
and
it
was
his
wont
still
to
betake
himself
thither
he
and
his
wife
and
kill
the
pig
and
have
it
salted
on
the
spot
it
chanced
one
year
that
his
wife
being
somewhat
ailing
he
went
himself
to
kill
the
pig
which
bruno
and
buffalmacco
hearing
and
knowing
that
his
wife
was
not
gone
to
the
farm
with
him
they
repaired
to
a
priest
very
great
friend
of
theirs
and
a
neighbor
of
calandrino
to
sojourn
some
days
with
him
now
calandrino
had
that
very
morning
killed
the
pig
and
seeing
them
with
the
priest
called
to
them
saying
are
welcome
i
would
fain
have
you
see
what
a
good
husband
i
am
then
carrying
them
into
the
house
he
showed
them
the
pig
which
they
seeing
to
be
a
very
fine
one
and
understanding
from
calandrino
that
he
meant
to
salt
it
down
for
his
family
lack
quoth
bruno
to
him
a
ninny
thou
art
sell
it
and
let
us
make
merry
with
the
price
and
tell
thy
wife
that
it
hath
been
stolen
from
thee
answered
calandrino
would
never
believe
it
and
would
drive
me
out
of
the
house
spare
your
pains
for
i
will
never
do
it
and
many
were
the
words
but
they
availed
nothing
footnote
in
the
old
sense
of
manager
calandrino
invited
them
to
supper
but
with
so
ill
a
grace
that
they
refused
to
sup
there
and
took
their
leave
of
him
whereupon
quoth
bruno
and
buffalmacco
sayest
thou
to
stealing
yonder
pig
from
him
replied
the
other
can
we
do
it
quoth
bruno
can
see
how
well
enough
an
he
remove
it
not
from
where
it
was
but
now
rejoined
his
companion
us
do
it
why
should
we
not
and
after
we
will
make
merry
over
it
with
the
parson
here
the
priest
answered
that
he
would
well
and
bruno
said
must
some
little
art
be
used
thou
knowest
buffalmacco
how
niggardly
calandrino
is
and
how
gladly
he
drinketh
when
others
pay
let
us
go
and
carry
him
to
the
tavern
where
the
priest
shall
make
believe
to
pay
the
whole
scot
in
our
honor
nor
suffer
him
to
pay
aught
calandrino
will
soon
grow
fuddled
and
then
we
can
manage
it
lightly
enough
for
that
he
is
alone
in
the
house
as
he
said
so
they
did
and
calandrino
seeing
that
the
priest
suffered
none
to
pay
gave
himself
up
to
drinking
and
took
in
a
good
load
albeit
it
needed
no
great
matter
to
make
him
drunk
it
was
pretty
late
at
night
when
they
left
the
tavern
and
calandrino
without
troubling
himself
about
supper
went
straight
home
where
thinking
to
have
shut
the
door
he
left
it
open
and
betook
himself
to
bed
buffalmacco
and
bruno
went
off
to
sup
with
the
priest
and
after
supper
repaired
quietly
to
calandrino
house
carrying
with
them
certain
implements
wherewithal
to
break
in
whereas
bruno
had
appointed
it
but
finding
the
door
open
they
entered
and
unhooking
the
pig
carried
it
off
to
the
priest
house
where
they
laid
it
up
and
betook
themselves
to
sleep
on
the
morrow
calandrino
having
slept
off
the
fumes
of
the
wine
arose
in
the
morning
and
going
down
missed
his
pig
and
saw
the
door
open
whereupon
he
questioned
this
one
and
that
if
they
knew
who
had
taken
it
and
getting
no
news
of
it
began
to
make
a
great
outcry
saying
is
me
miserable
wretch
that
i
am
for
that
the
pig
had
been
stolen
from
him
as
soon
as
bruno
and
buffalmacco
were
risen
they
repaired
to
calandrino
house
to
hear
what
he
would
say
anent
the
pig
and
he
no
sooner
saw
them
than
he
called
out
to
them
well
nigh
weeping
and
said
me
comrades
mine
my
pig
hath
been
stolen
from
me
whereupon
bruno
came
up
to
him
and
said
softly
is
a
marvel
that
thou
hast
been
wise
for
once
replied
calandrino
i
say
sooth
the
thing
to
say
quoth
bruno
a
great
outcry
so
it
may
well
appear
that
it
is
as
thou
sayst
therewithal
calandrino
bawled
out
yet
loudlier
saying
body
i
tell
thee
it
hath
been
stolen
from
me
in
good
earnest
good
replied
bruno
the
way
to
speak
cry
out
lustily
make
thyself
well
heard
so
it
may
seem
true
quoth
calandrino
wouldst
make
me
give
my
soul
to
the
fiend
i
tell
thee
and
thou
believest
me
not
may
i
be
strung
up
by
the
neck
an
it
have
not
been
stolen
from
me
lack
cried
bruno
can
that
be
i
saw
it
here
but
yesterday
thinkest
thou
to
make
me
believe
that
it
hath
flown
away
quoth
calandrino
is
as
i
tell
thee
lack
repeated
bruno
it
be
replied
calandrino
is
so
more
by
token
that
i
am
undone
and
know
not
how
i
shall
return
home
my
wife
will
never
believe
me
or
even
if
she
do
i
shall
have
no
peace
with
her
this
year
to
come
quoth
bruno
god
save
me
this
is
ill
done
if
it
be
true
but
thou
knowest
calandrino
i
lessoned
thee
yesterday
to
say
thus
and
i
would
not
have
thee
at
once
cozen
thy
wife
and
us
therewithal
calandrino
fell
to
crying
out
and
saying
why
will
you
drive
me
to
desperation
and
make
me
blaspheme
god
and
the
saints
i
tell
you
the
pig
was
stolen
from
me
yesternight
then
said
buffalmacco
it
be
so
indeed
we
must
cast
about
for
a
means
of
having
it
again
an
we
may
contrive
it
what
means
asked
calandrino
we
find
quoth
buffalmacco
may
be
sure
that
there
hath
come
none
from
the
indies
to
rob
thee
of
thy
pig
the
thief
must
have
been
some
one
of
thy
neighbors
an
thou
canst
make
shift
to
assemble
them
i
know
how
to
work
the
ordeal
by
bread
and
cheese
and
we
will
presently
see
for
certain
who
hath
had
it
put
in
bruno
wouldst
make
a
fine
thing
of
bread
and
cheese
with
such
gentry
as
we
have
about
here
for
one
of
them
i
am
certain
hath
had
the
pig
and
he
would
smoke
the
trap
and
would
not
come
then
shall
we
do
asked
buffalmacco
and
bruno
said
must
do
it
with
ginger
boluses
and
good
vernage
and
invite
them
to
drink
they
will
suspect
nothing
and
come
and
the
ginger
boluses
can
be
blessed
even
as
the
bread
and
cheese
quoth
buffalmacco
thou
sayst
sooth
what
sayst
thou
calandrino
shall
do
replied
the
gull
pray
you
thereof
for
the
love
of
god
for
did
i
but
know
who
hath
had
it
i
should
hold
myself
half
consoled
then
said
bruno
am
ready
to
go
to
florence
to
oblige
thee
for
the
things
aforesaid
so
thou
wilt
give
me
the
money
now
calandrino
had
maybe
forty
shillings
which
he
gave
him
and
bruno
accordingly
repaired
to
florence
to
a
friend
of
his
a
druggist
of
whom
he
bought
a
pound
of
fine
ginger
boluses
and
caused
compound
a
couple
of
dogballs
with
fresh
confect
of
hepatic
aloes
after
which
he
let
cover
these
latter
with
sugar
like
the
others
and
set
thereon
a
privy
mark
by
which
he
might
very
well
know
them
so
he
should
not
mistake
them
nor
change
them
then
buying
a
flask
of
good
vernage
he
returned
to
calandrino
in
the
country
and
said
to
him
thou
morning
invite
those
whom
thou
suspectest
to
drink
with
thee
it
is
a
holiday
and
all
will
willingly
come
meanwhile
buffalmacco
and
i
will
make
the
conjuration
over
the
pills
and
bring
them
to
thee
morning
at
home
and
for
the
love
of
thee
i
will
administer
them
myself
and
do
and
say
that
which
is
to
be
said
and
done
footnote
white
wine
see
note
calandrino
did
as
he
said
and
assembled
on
the
following
morning
a
goodly
company
of
such
young
florentines
as
were
presently
about
the
village
and
of
husbandmen
whereupon
bruno
and
buffalmacco
came
with
a
box
of
pills
and
the
flask
of
wine
and
made
the
folk
stand
in
a
ring
then
said
bruno
needs
must
i
tell
you
the
reason
wherefore
you
are
here
so
that
if
aught
betide
that
please
you
not
you
may
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
me
calandrino
here
was
robbed
yesternight
of
a
fine
pig
nor
can
he
find
who
hath
had
it
and
for
that
none
other
than
some
one
of
us
who
are
here
can
have
stolen
it
from
him
he
proffereth
each
of
you
that
he
may
discover
who
hath
had
it
one
of
these
pills
to
eat
and
a
draught
of
wine
now
you
must
know
that
he
who
hath
had
the
pig
will
not
be
able
to
swallow
the
pill
nay
it
will
seem
to
him
more
bitter
than
poison
and
he
will
spit
it
out
wherefore
rather
than
that
shame
be
done
him
in
the
presence
of
so
many
he
were
better
tell
it
to
the
parson
by
way
of
confession
and
i
will
proceed
no
farther
with
this
matter
all
who
were
there
declared
that
they
would
willingly
eat
of
the
pills
whereupon
bruno
ranged
them
in
order
and
set
calandrino
among
them
then
beginning
at
one
end
of
the
line
he
proceeded
to
give
each
his
bolus
and
whenas
he
came
over
against
calandrino
he
took
one
of
the
dogballs
and
put
it
into
his
hand
calandrino
clapped
it
incontinent
into
his
mouth
and
began
to
chew
it
but
no
sooner
did
his
tongue
taste
the
aloes
than
he
spat
it
out
again
being
unable
to
brook
the
bitterness
meanwhile
each
was
looking
other
in
the
face
to
see
who
should
spit
out
his
bolus
and
whilst
bruno
not
having
made
an
end
of
serving
them
out
went
on
to
do
so
feigning
to
pay
no
heed
to
calandrino
doing
he
heard
say
behind
him
now
calandrino
what
meaneth
this
whereupon
he
turned
suddenly
round
and
seeing
that
calandrino
had
spat
out
his
bolus
said
maybe
somewhat
else
hath
caused
him
spit
it
out
take
another
of
them
then
taking
the
other
dogball
he
thrust
it
into
calandrino
mouth
and
went
on
to
finish
giving
out
the
rest
if
the
first
ball
seemed
bitter
to
calandrino
the
second
was
bitterer
yet
but
being
ashamed
to
spit
it
out
he
kept
it
awhile
in
his
mouth
chewing
it
and
shedding
tears
that
seemed
so
big
they
were
till
at
last
unable
to
hold
out
longer
he
cast
it
forth
like
as
he
had
the
first
meanwhile
buffalmacco
and
bruno
gave
the
company
to
drink
and
all
seeing
this
declared
that
calandrino
had
certainly
stolen
the
pig
from
himself
nay
there
were
those
there
who
rated
him
roundly
after
they
were
all
gone
and
the
two
rogues
left
alone
with
calandrino
buffalmacco
said
to
him
still
had
it
for
certain
that
it
was
thou
tookst
the
pig
thyself
and
wouldst
fain
make
us
believe
that
it
had
been
stolen
from
thee
to
escape
giving
us
one
poor
while
to
drink
of
the
monies
thou
hadst
for
it
calandrino
who
was
not
yet
quit
of
the
bitter
taste
of
the
aloes
began
to
swear
that
he
had
not
had
it
and
buffalmacco
said
in
good
earnest
comrade
what
gottest
thou
for
it
was
it
six
florins
calandrino
hearing
this
began
to
wax
desperate
and
bruno
said
calandrino
there
was
such
an
one
in
the
company
that
ate
and
drank
with
us
who
told
me
that
thou
hast
a
wench
over
yonder
whom
thou
keepest
for
thy
pleasure
and
to
whom
thou
givest
whatsoever
thou
canst
scrape
together
and
that
he
held
it
for
certain
that
thou
hadst
sent
her
the
pig
thou
hast
learned
of
late
to
play
pranks
of
this
kind
thou
carriedst
us
off
day
down
the
mugnone
picking
up
black
stones
and
whenas
thou
hadst
gotten
us
aboard
ship
without
biscuit
thou
madest
off
and
wouldst
after
have
us
believe
that
thou
hadst
found
the
magic
stone
and
now
on
like
wise
thou
thinkest
by
dint
of
oaths
to
make
us
believe
that
the
pig
which
thou
hast
given
away
or
more
like
sold
hath
been
stolen
from
thee
but
we
are
used
to
thy
tricks
and
know
them
thou
shalt
not
avail
to
play
us
any
more
of
them
and
to
be
plain
with
thee
since
we
have
been
at
pains
to
make
the
conjuration
we
mean
that
thou
shalt
give
us
two
pairs
of
capons
else
will
we
tell
mistress
tessa
everything
calandrino
seeing
that
he
was
not
believed
and
himseeming
he
had
had
vexation
enough
without
having
his
wife
scolding
into
the
bargain
gave
them
two
pairs
of
capons
which
they
carried
off
to
florence
after
they
had
salted
the
pig
leaving
calandrino
to
digest
the
loss
and
the
flouting
as
best
he
might
footnote
embarked
on
a
bootless
quest
the
seventh
story
day
the
eighth
a
scholar
loveth
a
widow
lady
who
being
enamoured
of
another
causeth
him
spend
one
winter
night
in
the
snow
awaiting
her
and
he
after
contriveth
by
his
sleight
to
have
her
abide
naked
all
one
day
on
the
summit
of
a
tower
exposed
to
flies
and
gads
and
sun
the
ladies
laughed
amain
at
the
unhappy
calandrino
and
would
have
laughed
yet
more
but
that
it
irked
them
to
see
him
fleeced
of
the
capons
to
boot
by
those
who
had
already
robbed
him
of
the
pig
but
as
soon
as
the
end
of
the
story
was
come
the
queen
charged
pampinea
tell
hers
and
she
promptly
began
thus
it
chanceth
oft
dearest
ladies
that
craft
is
put
to
scorn
by
craft
and
it
is
therefore
a
sign
of
little
wit
to
delight
in
making
mock
of
others
we
have
for
several
stories
laughed
amain
at
tricks
that
have
been
played
upon
folk
and
whereof
no
vengeance
is
recorded
to
have
been
taken
but
i
purpose
now
to
cause
you
have
some
compassion
of
a
just
retribution
wreaked
upon
a
townswoman
of
ours
on
whose
head
her
own
cheat
recoiled
and
was
retorted
well
nigh
unto
death
and
the
hearing
of
this
will
not
be
without
profit
unto
you
for
that
henceforward
you
will
the
better
keep
yourselves
from
making
mock
of
others
and
in
this
you
will
show
great
good
sense
not
many
years
ago
there
was
in
florence
a
young
lady
by
name
elena
fair
of
favour
and
haughty
of
humour
of
very
gentle
lineage
and
endowed
with
sufficient
abundance
of
the
goods
of
fortune
who
being
widowed
of
her
husband
chose
never
to
marry
again
for
that
she
was
enamoured
of
a
handsome
and
agreeable
youth
of
her
own
choice
and
with
the
aid
of
a
maid
of
hers
in
whom
she
put
great
trust
being
quit
of
every
other
care
she
often
with
marvellous
delight
gave
herself
a
good
time
with
him
in
these
days
it
chanced
that
a
young
gentleman
of
our
city
by
name
rinieri
having
long
studied
in
paris
not
for
the
sake
of
after
selling
his
knowledge
by
retail
as
many
do
but
to
know
the
nature
of
things
and
their
causes
the
which
excellently
becometh
a
gentleman
returned
thence
to
florence
and
there
lived
much
honoured
as
well
for
his
nobility
as
for
his
learning
but
as
it
chanceth
often
that
those
who
have
the
most
experience
of
things
profound
are
the
soonest
snared
of
love
even
so
it
befell
this
rinieri
for
having
one
day
repaired
by
way
of
diversion
to
an
entertainment
there
presented
herself
before
his
eyes
the
aforesaid
elena
clad
all
in
black
as
our
widows
go
and
full
to
his
judgment
of
such
beauty
and
pleasantness
as
himseemed
he
had
never
beheld
in
any
other
woman
and
in
his
heart
he
deemed
that
he
might
call
himself
blest
whom
god
should
vouchsafe
to
hold
her
naked
in
his
arms
then
furtively
considering
her
once
and
again
and
knowing
that
great
things
and
precious
were
not
to
be
acquired
without
travail
he
altogether
determined
in
himself
to
devote
all
his
pains
and
all
his
diligence
to
the
pleasing
her
to
the
end
that
thereby
he
might
gain
her
love
and
so
avail
to
have
his
fill
of
her
the
young
lady
who
kept
not
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
nether
world
but
conceiting
herself
as
much
and
more
than
as
much
as
she
was
moved
them
artfully
hither
and
thither
gazing
all
about
and
was
quick
to
note
who
delighted
to
look
upon
her
soon
became
aware
of
rinieri
and
said
laughing
in
herself
have
not
come
hither
in
vain
for
an
i
mistake
not
i
have
caught
a
woodcock
by
the
bill
accordingly
she
fell
to
ogling
him
from
time
to
time
with
the
tail
of
her
eye
and
studied
inasmuch
as
she
might
to
let
him
see
that
she
took
note
of
him
thinking
that
the
more
men
she
allured
and
ensnared
with
her
charms
so
much
the
more
of
price
would
her
beauty
be
especially
to
him
on
whom
she
had
bestowed
it
together
with
her
love
the
learned
scholar
laying
aside
philosophical
speculations
turned
all
his
thoughts
to
her
and
thinking
to
please
her
enquired
where
she
lived
and
proceeded
to
pass
to
and
fro
before
her
house
colouring
his
comings
and
goings
with
various
pretexts
whilst
the
lady
idly
glorying
in
this
for
the
reason
already
set
out
made
believe
to
take
great
pleasure
in
seeing
him
accordingly
he
found
means
to
clap
up
an
acquaintance
with
her
maid
and
discovering
to
her
his
love
prayed
her
make
interest
for
him
with
her
mistress
so
he
might
avail
to
have
her
favour
the
maid
promised
freely
and
told
the
lady
who
hearkened
with
the
heartiest
laughter
in
the
world
and
said
thou
where
yonder
man
cometh
to
lose
the
wit
he
hath
brought
back
from
paris
marry
we
will
give
him
that
which
he
goeth
seeking
an
he
bespeak
thee
again
do
thou
tell
him
that
i
love
him
far
more
than
he
loveth
me
but
that
it
behoveth
me
look
to
mine
honour
so
i
may
hold
up
my
head
with
the
other
ladies
whereof
and
he
be
as
wise
as
folk
say
he
will
hold
me
so
much
the
dearer
alack
poor
silly
soul
she
knew
not
aright
ladies
mine
what
it
is
to
try
conclusions
with
scholars
the
maid
went
in
search
of
rinieri
and
finding
him
did
that
which
had
been
enjoined
her
of
her
mistress
whereat
he
was
overjoyed
and
proceeded
to
use
more
urgent
entreaties
writing
letters
and
sending
presents
all
of
which
were
accepted
but
he
got
nothing
but
vague
and
general
answers
and
on
this
wise
she
held
him
in
play
a
great
while
at
last
to
show
her
lover
to
whom
she
had
discovered
everything
and
who
was
whiles
somewhat
vexed
with
her
for
this
and
had
conceived
some
jealousy
of
rinieri
that
he
did
wrong
to
suspect
her
thereof
she
despatched
to
the
scholar
now
grown
very
pressing
her
maid
who
told
him
on
her
mistress
part
that
she
had
never
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
do
aught
that
might
pleasure
him
since
he
had
certified
her
of
his
love
but
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
festival
of
the
nativity
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
be
with
him
wherefore
an
it
liked
him
he
was
on
the
evening
of
the
feast
to
come
by
night
to
her
courtyard
whither
she
would
go
for
him
as
first
she
might
at
this
the
scholar
was
the
gladdest
man
alive
and
betook
himself
at
the
appointed
time
to
his
mistress
house
where
he
was
carried
by
the
maid
into
a
courtyard
and
being
there
locked
in
proceeded
to
wait
the
lady
coming
the
latter
had
that
evening
sent
for
her
lover
and
after
she
had
supped
merrily
with
him
she
told
him
that
which
she
purposed
to
do
that
night
adding
thou
mayst
see
for
thyself
what
and
how
great
is
the
love
i
have
borne
and
bear
him
of
whom
thou
hast
taken
a
jealousy
the
lover
heard
these
words
with
great
satisfaction
and
was
impatient
to
see
by
the
fact
that
which
the
lady
gave
him
to
understand
with
words
it
had
by
chance
snowed
hard
during
the
day
and
everything
was
covered
with
snow
wherefore
the
scholar
had
not
long
abidden
in
the
courtyard
before
he
began
to
feel
colder
than
he
could
have
wished
but
looking
to
recruit
himself
speedily
he
was
fain
to
endure
it
with
patience
presently
the
lady
said
to
her
lover
us
go
look
from
a
lattice
what
yonder
fellow
of
whom
thou
art
waxed
jealous
doth
and
hear
what
he
shall
answer
the
maid
whom
i
have
sent
to
parley
with
him
accordingly
they
betook
themselves
to
a
lattice
and
thence
seeing
without
being
seen
they
heard
the
maid
from
another
lattice
bespeak
the
scholar
and
say
my
lady
is
the
woefullest
woman
that
was
aye
for
that
there
is
one
of
her
brothers
come
hither
who
hath
talked
much
with
her
and
after
must
needs
sup
with
her
nor
is
yet
gone
away
but
methinketh
he
will
soon
be
gone
wherefore
she
hath
not
been
able
to
come
to
thee
but
will
soon
come
now
and
prayeth
thee
not
to
take
the
waiting
in
ill
part
rinieri
believing
this
to
be
true
replied
my
lady
to
give
herself
no
concern
for
me
till
such
time
as
she
can
at
her
commodity
come
to
me
but
bid
her
do
this
as
quickliest
she
may
the
maid
turned
back
into
the
house
and
betook
herself
to
bed
whilst
the
lady
said
to
her
gallant
how
sayst
thou
thinkest
thou
that
an
i
wished
him
such
weal
as
thou
fearest
i
would
suffer
him
stand
down
yonder
so
saying
she
betook
herself
to
bed
with
her
lover
who
was
now
in
part
satisfied
and
there
they
abode
a
great
while
in
joyance
and
liesse
laughing
and
making
mock
of
the
wretched
scholar
who
fared
to
and
fro
the
while
in
the
courtyard
making
shift
to
warm
himself
with
exercise
nor
had
whereas
he
might
seat
himself
or
shelter
from
the
he
cursed
her
brother
long
stay
with
the
lady
and
took
everything
he
heard
for
the
opening
of
a
door
to
him
by
her
but
hoped
in
vain
the
lady
having
solaced
herself
with
her
lover
till
near
upon
midnight
said
to
him
deemest
thou
my
soul
of
our
scholar
whether
seemeth
to
thee
the
greater
his
wit
or
the
love
i
bear
him
will
the
cold
which
i
presently
cause
him
suffer
do
away
from
thy
mind
the
doubts
which
my
pleasantries
aroused
therein
the
other
day
whereto
he
replied
of
my
body
yes
i
know
right
well
that
like
as
thou
art
my
good
and
my
peace
and
my
delight
and
all
my
hope
even
so
am
i
thine
rejoined
she
me
a
thousand
times
so
i
may
see
if
thou
say
sooth
whereupon
he
clipped
her
fast
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
not
a
thousand
but
more
than
an
hundred
thousand
times
then
after
they
had
abidden
awhile
in
such
discourse
the
lady
said
let
us
arise
a
little
and
go
see
if
the
fire
is
anydele
spent
wherein
this
my
new
lover
wrote
me
that
he
burnt
all
day
long
accordingly
they
arose
and
getting
them
to
the
accustomed
lattice
looked
out
into
the
courtyard
where
they
saw
the
scholar
dancing
a
right
merry
jig
on
the
snow
so
fast
and
brisk
that
never
had
they
seen
the
like
to
the
sound
of
the
chattering
of
the
teeth
that
he
made
for
excess
of
cold
whereupon
quoth
the
lady
sayst
thou
sweet
my
hope
seemeth
to
thee
that
i
know
how
to
make
folk
jig
it
without
sound
of
trump
or
bagpipe
whereto
he
answered
laughing
dost
thou
my
chief
delight
quoth
the
lady
will
that
we
go
down
to
the
door
thou
shalt
abide
quiet
whilst
i
bespeak
him
and
we
shall
hear
what
he
will
say
belike
we
shall
have
no
less
diversion
thereof
than
we
had
from
seeing
him
accordingly
they
softly
opened
the
chamber
and
stole
down
to
the
door
where
without
opening
it
anydele
the
lady
called
to
the
scholar
in
a
low
voice
by
a
little
hole
that
was
there
rinieri
hearing
himself
called
praised
god
taking
it
oversoon
for
granted
that
he
was
to
be
presently
admitted
and
coming
up
to
the
door
said
am
i
madam
open
for
god
sake
for
i
die
of
cold
ay
replied
the
lady
know
thou
art
a
chilly
one
is
then
the
cold
so
exceeding
great
because
forsooth
there
is
a
little
snow
about
i
wot
the
nights
are
much
colder
in
paris
i
can
not
open
to
thee
yet
for
that
accursed
brother
of
mine
who
came
to
sup
with
me
is
not
yet
gone
but
he
will
soon
begone
and
i
will
come
incontinent
to
open
to
thee
i
have
but
now
very
hardly
stolen
away
from
him
that
i
might
come
to
exhort
thee
not
to
wax
weary
of
waiting
madam
cried
the
scholar
pray
you
for
god
sake
open
to
me
so
i
may
abide
within
under
cover
for
that
this
little
while
past
there
is
come
on
the
thickest
snow
in
the
world
and
it
yet
snoweth
and
i
will
wait
for
you
as
long
as
it
shall
please
you
me
sweet
my
treasure
replied
the
lady
can
not
i
for
this
door
maketh
so
great
a
noise
whenas
it
is
opened
that
it
would
lightly
be
heard
of
my
brother
if
i
should
open
to
thee
but
i
will
go
bid
him
begone
so
i
may
after
come
back
and
open
to
thee
go
quickly
rejoined
he
i
prithee
let
make
a
good
fire
so
i
may
warm
me
as
soon
as
i
come
in
for
that
i
am
grown
so
cold
i
can
scarce
feel
myself
quoth
the
lady
should
not
be
possible
an
that
be
true
which
thou
hast
many
a
time
written
me
to
wit
that
thou
burnest
for
the
love
of
me
now
i
must
go
wait
and
be
of
good
heart
then
with
her
lover
who
had
heard
all
this
with
the
utmost
pleasure
she
went
back
to
bed
and
that
night
they
slept
little
nay
they
spent
it
well
nigh
all
in
dalliance
and
delight
and
in
making
mock
of
rinieri
meanwhile
the
unhappy
scholar
now
well
nigh
grown
a
stork
so
sore
did
his
teeth
chatter
perceiving
at
last
that
he
was
befooled
essayed
again
and
again
to
open
the
door
and
sought
an
he
might
not
avail
to
issue
thence
by
another
way
but
finding
no
means
thereunto
he
fell
to
and
fro
like
a
lion
cursing
the
foulness
of
the
weather
and
the
lady
malignity
and
the
length
of
the
night
together
with
his
own
credulity
wherefore
being
sore
despited
against
his
mistress
the
long
and
ardent
love
he
had
borne
her
was
suddenly
changed
to
fierce
and
bitter
hatred
and
he
revolved
in
himself
many
and
various
things
so
he
might
find
a
means
of
revenge
the
which
he
now
desired
far
more
eagerly
than
he
had
before
desired
to
be
with
the
lady
at
last
after
much
long
tarriance
the
night
drew
near
unto
day
and
the
dawn
began
to
appear
whereupon
the
maid
who
had
been
lessoned
by
the
lady
coming
down
opened
the
courtyard
door
and
feigning
to
have
compassion
of
rinieri
said
luck
may
he
have
who
came
hither
yestereve
he
hath
kept
us
all
night
upon
thorns
and
hath
caused
thee
freeze
but
knowest
thou
what
bear
it
with
patience
for
that
which
could
not
be
shall
be
another
time
indeed
i
know
nought
could
have
happened
that
had
been
so
displeasing
to
my
lady
the
despiteful
scholar
like
a
wise
man
as
he
was
who
knew
that
threats
are
but
arms
for
the
threatened
locked
up
in
his
breast
that
which
untempered
will
would
fain
have
vented
and
said
in
a
low
voice
without
anywise
showing
himself
vexed
truth
i
have
had
the
worst
night
i
ever
had
but
i
have
well
apprehended
that
the
lady
is
nowise
to
blame
for
this
inasmuch
as
she
herself
of
her
compassion
for
me
came
down
hither
to
excuse
herself
and
to
hearten
me
and
as
thou
sayest
that
which
hath
not
been
shall
be
another
time
commend
me
to
her
and
god
be
with
thee
therewithal
well
nigh
stark
with
cold
he
made
his
way
as
best
he
might
back
to
his
house
where
being
drowsed
to
death
he
cast
himself
upon
his
bed
to
sleep
and
awoke
well
nigh
crippled
of
his
arms
and
legs
wherefore
sending
for
sundry
physicians
and
acquainting
them
with
the
cold
he
had
suffered
he
caused
take
order
for
his
cure
the
leaches
plying
him
with
prompt
and
very
potent
remedies
hardly
after
some
time
availed
to
recover
him
of
the
shrinking
of
the
sinews
and
cause
them
relax
and
but
that
he
was
young
and
that
the
warm
season
came
on
he
had
overmuch
to
suffer
however
being
restored
to
health
and
lustihead
he
kept
his
hate
to
himself
and
feigned
himself
more
than
ever
enamoured
of
his
widow
now
it
befell
after
a
certain
space
of
time
that
fortune
furnished
him
with
an
occasion
of
satisfying
his
desire
for
vengeance
for
that
the
youth
beloved
of
the
widow
being
without
any
regard
for
the
love
she
bore
him
fallen
enamoured
of
another
lady
would
have
nor
little
nor
much
to
say
to
her
nor
do
aught
to
pleasure
her
wherefore
she
pined
in
tears
and
bitterness
but
her
maid
who
had
great
compassion
of
her
finding
no
way
of
rousing
her
mistress
from
the
chagrin
into
which
the
loss
of
her
lover
had
cast
her
and
seeing
the
scholar
pass
along
the
street
after
the
wonted
manner
entered
into
a
fond
conceit
to
wit
that
the
lady
lover
might
be
brought
by
some
necromantic
operation
or
other
to
love
her
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
and
that
the
scholar
should
be
a
past
master
in
this
manner
of
thing
and
told
her
thought
to
her
mistress
the
latter
little
wise
without
considering
that
had
the
scholar
been
acquainted
with
the
black
art
he
would
have
practised
it
for
himself
lent
her
mind
to
her
words
and
bade
her
forthright
learn
from
him
if
he
would
do
it
and
give
him
all
assurance
that
in
requital
thereof
she
would
do
whatsoever
pleased
him
the
maid
did
her
errand
well
and
diligently
which
when
the
scholar
heard
he
was
overjoyed
and
said
in
himself
be
thou
my
god
the
time
is
come
when
with
thine
aid
i
may
avail
to
make
yonder
wicked
woman
pay
the
penalty
of
the
harm
she
did
me
in
requital
of
the
great
love
i
bore
her
then
to
the
maid
my
lady
quoth
he
she
need
be
in
no
concern
for
this
for
that
were
her
lover
in
the
indies
i
would
speedily
cause
him
come
to
her
and
crave
pardon
of
that
which
he
hath
done
to
displeasure
her
but
the
means
she
must
take
to
this
end
i
purpose
to
impart
to
herself
when
and
where
it
shall
most
please
her
so
say
to
her
and
hearten
her
on
my
part
the
maid
carried
his
answer
to
her
mistress
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
foregather
at
santa
lucia
del
prato
whither
accordingly
the
lady
and
the
scholar
being
come
and
speaking
together
alone
she
remembering
her
not
that
she
had
aforetime
brought
him
well
nigh
to
death
door
openly
discovered
to
him
her
case
and
that
which
she
desired
and
besought
him
to
succour
her
answered
he
is
true
that
amongst
the
other
things
i
learned
at
paris
was
necromancy
whereof
for
certain
i
know
that
which
is
extant
thereof
but
for
that
the
thing
is
supremely
displeasing
unto
god
i
had
sworn
never
to
practise
it
either
for
myself
or
for
others
nevertheless
the
love
i
bear
you
is
of
such
potency
that
i
know
not
how
i
may
deny
you
aught
that
you
would
have
me
do
wherefore
though
it
should
behove
me
for
this
alone
go
to
the
devil
stead
i
am
yet
ready
to
do
it
since
it
is
your
pleasure
but
i
must
forewarn
you
that
the
thing
is
more
uneath
to
do
than
you
perchance
imagine
especially
whenas
a
woman
would
recall
a
man
to
loving
her
or
a
man
a
woman
for
that
this
can
not
be
done
save
by
the
very
person
unto
whom
it
pertaineth
and
it
behoveth
that
whoso
doth
it
be
of
an
assured
mind
seeing
it
must
be
done
anights
and
in
solitary
places
without
company
which
things
i
know
not
how
you
are
disposed
to
do
the
lady
more
enamoured
than
discreet
replied
spurreth
me
on
such
wise
that
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
have
again
him
who
hath
wrongfully
forsaken
me
algates
an
it
please
you
show
me
in
what
i
must
approve
myself
assured
of
mind
replied
the
scholar
who
had
a
patch
of
ill
hair
to
his
tail
must
make
an
image
of
pewter
in
his
name
whom
you
desire
to
get
again
which
whenas
i
shall
send
you
it
will
behove
you
seven
times
bathe
yourself
therewith
all
naked
in
a
running
stream
at
the
hour
of
the
first
sleep
what
time
the
moon
is
far
on
the
wane
thereafter
naked
as
you
are
you
must
get
you
up
into
a
tree
or
to
the
top
of
some
uninhabited
house
and
turning
to
the
north
with
the
image
in
your
hand
seven
times
running
say
certain
words
which
i
shall
give
you
written
which
when
you
shall
have
done
there
will
come
to
you
two
of
the
fairest
damsels
you
ever
beheld
who
will
salute
you
and
ask
you
courteously
what
you
would
have
done
do
you
well
and
throughly
discover
to
them
your
desires
and
look
it
betide
you
not
to
name
one
for
another
as
soon
as
you
have
told
them
they
will
depart
and
you
may
then
come
down
to
the
place
where
you
shall
have
left
your
clothes
and
yourself
and
return
home
and
for
certain
ere
it
be
the
middle
of
the
ensuing
night
your
lover
will
come
weeping
to
crave
you
pardon
and
mercy
and
know
that
from
that
time
forth
he
will
never
again
leave
you
for
any
other
footnote
a
proverbial
way
of
saying
that
he
bore
malice
and
was
vindictive
the
lady
hearing
all
this
and
lending
entire
faith
thereto
was
half
comforted
herseeming
she
already
had
her
lover
again
in
her
arms
and
said
fear
i
will
very
well
do
these
things
and
i
have
therefor
the
finest
commodity
in
the
world
for
i
have
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
val
a
farm
which
is
very
near
the
and
it
is
now
july
so
that
bathing
will
be
pleasant
more
by
token
that
i
mind
me
there
is
not
far
from
the
stream
a
little
uninhabited
tower
save
that
the
shepherds
climb
up
bytimes
by
a
ladder
of
that
is
there
to
a
sollar
at
the
top
to
look
for
their
strayed
beasts
otherwise
it
is
a
very
solitary
place
thither
will
i
betake
myself
and
there
i
hope
to
do
that
which
you
shall
enjoin
me
the
best
in
the
world
the
scholar
who
very
well
knew
both
the
place
and
the
tower
mentioned
by
the
lady
was
rejoiced
to
be
certified
of
her
intent
and
said
i
was
never
in
these
part
and
therefore
know
neither
the
farm
nor
the
tower
but
an
it
be
as
you
say
nothing
in
the
world
can
be
better
wherefore
whenas
it
shall
be
time
i
will
send
you
the
image
and
the
conjuration
but
i
pray
you
instantly
whenas
you
shall
have
gotten
your
desire
and
shall
know
i
have
served
you
well
that
you
be
mindful
of
me
and
remember
to
keep
your
promise
to
me
she
answered
that
she
would
without
fail
do
it
and
taking
leave
of
him
returned
to
her
house
whilst
the
scholar
rejoiced
for
that
himseemed
his
desire
was
like
to
have
effect
made
an
image
with
certain
talismanic
characters
of
his
own
devising
and
wrote
a
rigmarole
of
his
fashion
by
way
of
conjuration
the
which
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
he
despatched
to
the
lady
and
sent
to
tell
her
that
she
must
that
very
night
without
more
tarriance
do
that
which
he
had
enjoined
her
after
which
he
secretly
betook
himself
with
a
servant
of
his
to
the
house
of
one
of
his
friends
who
abode
very
near
the
tower
so
he
might
give
effect
to
his
design

lit

di
the
lady
on
her
part
set
out
with
her
maid
and
repaired
to
her
farm
where
as
soon
as
the
night
was
come
she
made
a
show
of
going
to
bed
and
sent
the
maid
away
to
sleep
but
towards
the
hour
of
the

she
issued
quietly
forth
of
the
house

herself
to
the
bank
of
the
arno
hard
by
the
tower
where
looking
first
well
all
about
and
seeing
nor
hearing
any
she
put
off
her
clothes
and
hiding
them
under
a
bush
bathed
seven
times
with
the
image
after
which
naked
as
she
was
she
made
for

the

who
had
at
the
coming
on
of
the
night
hidden
himself
with
his
servant
among
the
willows
and
other
trees
near
the
tower
and
had
witnessed
all
this
seeing
her
as
she
passed
thus
naked
close
to
him
overcome
the
darkness
of
the
night
with
the
whiteness
of
her
body
and
after
considering
her
breast
and
the
other
parts
of
her
person
and
seeing
them
fair
bethought
himself
what
they
should
become
in
a
little
while
and
felt
some
compassion
of
her
whilst
on
the
other
hand
the
pricks
of
the
flesh
assailed
him
of
a
sudden
and
caused
that
stand
on
end
which
erst
lay
prone
inciting
him
to
issue
forth
of
his
ambush
and
go
take
her
and
do
his
will
of
her
between
the
one
and
the
other
he
was
like
to
be
overcome
but
calling
to
mind
who
he
was
and
what
the
injury
he
had
suffered
and
wherefore
and
at
whose
hands
and
he
being
thereby
rekindled
in
despite
and
compassion
and
carnal
appetite
banished
he
abode
firm
in
his
purpose
and
let
her
go
the
lady
going
up
on
to
the
tower
and
turning
to
the
north
began
to
repeat
the
words
given
her
by
the
scholar
who
coming
quietly
into
the
tower
awhile
after
little
by
little
removed
the
ladder
which
led
to
the
sollar
where
she
was
and
after
awaited
that
which
she
should
do
and
say
meanwhile
the
lady
having
seven
times
said
her
conjuration
began
to
look
for
the
two
damsels
and
so
long
was
her
waiting
more
by
token
that
she
felt
it
cooler
than
she
could
have
wished
that
she
saw
the
dawn
appear
whereupon
woeful
that
it
had
not
befallen
as
the
scholar
had
told
her
she
said
in
herself
fear
me
yonder
man
hath
had
a
mind
to
give
me
a
night
such
as
that
which
i
gave
him
but
an
that
be
his
intent
he
hath
ill
known
to
avenge
himself
for
that
this
night
hath
not
been
as
long
by
a
third
as
was
his
forbye
that
the
cold
was
of
anothergates
sort
then
so
the
day
might
not
surprise
her
there
she
proceeded
to
seek
to
go
down
from
the
tower
but
found
the
ladder
gone
whereupon
her
courage
forsook
her
as
it
were
the
world
had
failed
beneath
her
feet
and
she
fell
down
aswoon
upon
the
platform
of
the
tower
as
soon
as
her
sense
returned
to
her
she
fell
to
weeping
piteously
and
bemoaning
herself
and
perceiving
but
too
well
that
this
must
have
been
the
doing
she
went
on
to
blame
herself
for
having
affronted
others
and
after
for
having
overmuch
trusted
in
him
whom
she
had
good
reason
to
believe
her
enemy
and
on
this
wise
she
abode
a
great
while
then
looking
if
there
were
no
way
of
descending
and
seeing
none
she
fell
again
to
her
lamentation
and
gave
herself
up
to
bitter
thought
saying
in
herself
unhappy
woman
what
will
be
said
of
thy
brothers
and
kinsfolk
and
neighbours
and
generally
of
all
the
people
of
florence
when
it
shall
be
known
that
thou
has
been
found
here
naked
thy
repute
that
hath
hitherto
been
so
great
will
be
known
to
have
been
false
and
shouldst
thou
seek
to
frame
lying
excuses
for
thyself
if
indeed
there
are
any
to
be
found
the
accursed
scholar
who
knoweth
all
thine
affairs
will
not
suffer
thee
lie
oh
wretched
woman
that
wilt
at
one
stroke
have
lost
the
youth
so
beloved
and
thine
own
honour
therewithal
she
fell
into
such
a
passion
of
woe
that
she
was
like
to
cast
herself
down
from
the
tower
to
the
ground
but
the
sun
being
now
risen
and
she
drawing
near
to
one
side
of
the
walls
of
the
tower
to
look
if
any
boy
should
pass
with
cattle
whom
she
might
send
for
her
maid
it
chanced
that
the
scholar
who
had
slept
awhile
at
the
foot
of
a
bush
awaking
saw
her
and
she
him
whereupon
quoth
he
to
her
day
madam
are
the
damsels
come
yet
the
lady
seeing
and
hearing
him
began
afresh
to
weep
sore
and
besought
him
to
come
within
the
tower
so
she
might
speak
with
him
in
this
he
was
courteous
enough
to
comply
with
her
and
she
laying
herself
prone
on
the
platform
and
showing
only
her
head
at
the
opening
said
weeping
rinieri
if
i
gave
thee
an
ill
night
thou
hast
well
avenged
thyself
of
me
for
that
albeit
it
is
july
i
have
thought
to
freeze
this
night
naked
as
i
am
more
by
token
that
i
have
so
sore
bewept
both
the
trick
i
put
upon
thee
and
mine
own
folly
in
believing
thee
that
it
is
a
wonder
i
have
any
eyes
left
in
my
head
wherefore
i
entreat
thee
not
for
the
love
of
me
whom
thou
hast
no
call
to
love
but
for
the
love
of
thyself
who
are
a
gentleman
that
thou
be
content
for
vengeance
of
the
injury
i
did
thee
with
that
which
thou
hast
already
done
and
cause
fetch
me
my
clothes
and
suffer
me
come
down
hence
nor
seek
to
take
from
me
that
which
thou
couldst
not
after
restore
me
an
thou
wouldst
to
wit
my
honour
for
if
i
took
from
thee
the
being
with
me
that
night
i
can
render
thee
many
nights
for
that
one
whenassoever
it
liketh
thee
let
this
then
suffice
and
let
it
content
thee
as
a
man
of
honour
to
have
availed
to
avenge
thyself
and
to
have
caused
me
confess
it
seek
not
to
use
thy
strength
against
a
woman
no
glory
is
it
for
an
eagle
to
have
overcome
a
dove
wherefore
for
the
love
of
god
and
thine
own
honour
have
pity
on
me
the
scholar
with
stern
mind
revolving
in
himself
the
injury
suffered

concerned
for
thine
honour
than
in
the

and
it
be

thee

these
thy
prayers

him
in
whose
arms
thou
didst
not
scruple
that
night
which
thou
thyself
recallest

me
the

go
about
thy
courtyard
chattering
with
my
teeth

trampling
the
snow
and
get
thee
succour
of
him
cause
him
fetch
thee
thy
clothes
and
set
thee
the
ladder
whereby
thou
mayest
descend
and
study
to
inform
him
with
tenderness
for
thine
honour
the
which
thou
hast
not
scrupled
both
now
and
a
thousand
other
times
to
imperil
for
him
why
dost
thou
not
call
him
to
come
help
thee
to
whom
pertaineth
it
more

unto

what
should

if
the

together

to

thee
from

folly

thy

that
thou

off

thine

i
had
overmuch
of
one
of

and
it
sufficeth
me
to
have
been
once
befooled
again
using
thy
craft
and
wiliness
in
speech
thou
studiest
by
extolling
me
to
gain
my
goodwill
and
callest
me
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
thinking
thus
to
cajole
me
into
playing
the
magnanimous
and
forebearing
to
punish
thee
for
thy
wickedness
but
thy
blandishments
shall
not
now
darken
me
the
eyes
of
the
understanding
as
did
thy
disloyal
promises
whilere
i
know
myself
nor

i
learn
so
much
of
myself
what
while
i
sojourned
at

me
in

single
night

thine

granted
i
were
indeed
magnanimous
thou
art
none
of
those
towards
whom
magnanimity
should
be
shown
the
issue
of
punishment
as
likewise
of
vengeance
in
the
case
of
wild
beasts
such
as
thou
art
behoveth
to
be
death
whereas
for
human
beings
that
should
suffice
whereof
thou
speakest
wherefore
albeit
i
am
no
eagle
knowing
thee
to
be
no
dove
but
a
venomous
serpent
i
mean
to
pursue
thee
as
an
immemorial
enemy
with
every
hate
and
all
my
might
albeit
this
that
i
do
to
thee
can
scarce
properly
be
styled
vengeance
but
rather
chastisement
inasmuch
as
vengeance
should
overpass
the
offence
and
this
will
not
attain
thereto
for
that
an
i
sought
to
avenge
myself
considering
to
what
a
pass
thou
broughtest
my
soul
thy

i
take
it
from
thee

not
suffice
me
no

the

an
hundred

thou
since
slaying
thee

should

slay
a
vile
wicked

trull

a

now
whose

in

thee

never

off

take

even
as
he
hath
made

went
forth

not

woebegone
sat
up

creeping
close
to
that
part

there
was

in
company

very

abode

hoping

passing
from

another
she
presently
fell
asleep
as
one
who
was
overcome
of
dolour
and
who
had
slept
no
whit
the
past
night
the
sun
which
was
exceeding
hot
being
now
risen
to
the
meridian
beat
full
and
straight
upon
her
tender
and
delicate
body
and
upon
her
head
which
was
all
uncovered
with
such
force
that
not
only
did
it
burn
her
flesh
wherever
it
touched
it
but
cracked
and
opened
it
all
over
little
by
little
and
such
was
the
pain
of
the
burning
that
it
constrained
her
to
awake
albeit
she
slept
fast
feeling
herself
on
the
roast
and
moving
somewhat
it
seemed
as
if
all
her
scorched
skin
cracked
and
clove
asunder
for
the
motion
as
we
see
happen
with
a
scorched
sheepskin
if
any
stretch
it
and
to

her
head
irked
her
so
sore
that
it
seemed
it
would
burst
which
was
no
wonder
and
the
platform
of
the
tower
was
so
burning
hot
that
she
could
find
no
restingplace
there
either
for
her
feet
or
for

wherefore
without
standing
fast
she
still
removed
now
hither
and
now
thither
weeping

there
being
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
flies
and
gads
flocked
thither
in
swarms

settling
upon

cracked
flesh
stung
her
so
cruelly
that
each

up
hither

quoth

recognizing

hath
brought
you
up

gone

you

unable

manner
all
recomforted
and
with
the

aid
mounting
the
ladder

was

naked
on

forspent

as
she

log
than

thrust
her
nails
into
her
own
face

fell
over
her

otherwise
than
as
she
had
been
dead
footnote
boccaccio
appears
to
have
forgotten
to
mention
that
rinieri
had
broken
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
when
he
withdrew
it
as
stated
apparently
to
place
an
additional
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
lady

the
lady
besought
her
for

be
silent

from
her
that
none
knew
where
she
had
been
save
those
who
had
carried
her
the
clothes
and
the
husbandman
there
present
was
somewhat
comforted
and
prayed
them
for
god
sake
never
to
say
aught
of
the
matter
to
any
one
then
after
much
parley
the
husbandman
taking
the
lady
in
his
arms
for
that
she
could
not
walk
brought
her
safely
without
the
tower
but
the
unlucky
maid
who
had
remained
behind
descending
less
circumspectly
made
a
slip
of
the
foot
and
falling
from
the
ladder
to
the
ground
broke
her
thigh
whereupon
she
fell
for
the
pain
that
it
seemed
a
lion
the
husbandman
setting
the
lady
down
on
a
plot
of
grass
went
to
see
what
ailed
the
maid
and
finding
her
with
her
thigh
broken
carried
her
also
to
the
and
laid
her
beside
her
mistress
who
seeing
this
befallen
in
addition
to
her
other
troubles
and
that
she
had
broken
her
thigh
by
whom
she
looked
to
have
been
succoured
more
than
by
any
else
was
beyond
measure
woebegone
and
fell
afresh
and
so
piteously
that
not
only
could
the
husbandman
not
avail
to
comfort
her
but
himself
fell
like
wise
but
presently
the
sun
being
now
low
he
repaired
at
the
instance
of
the
disconsolate
lady
lest
the
night
should
overtake
them
there
to
his
own
house
and
there
called
his
wife
and
two
brothers
of
his
who
returned
to
the
tower
with
a
plank
and
setting
the
maid
thereon
carried
her
home
whilst
he
himself
having
comforted
the
lady
with
a
little
cold
water
and
kind
words
took
her
up
in
his
arms
and
brought
her
to
her
own
chamber
his
wife
gave
her
a
to
eat
and
after
undressing
her
put
her
to
bed
and
they
contrived
that
night
to
have
her
and
her
maid
carried
to
florence
there
the
lady
who
had
shifts
and
devices
great
plenty
framed
a
story
of
her
fashion
altogether
out
of
conformity
with
that
which
had
passed
and
gave
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
every
one
else
to
believe
that
this
had
befallen
herself
and
her
maid
by
dint
of
diabolical
bewitchments
physicians
were
quickly
at
hand
who
not
without
putting
her
to
very
great
anguish
and
vexation
recovered
the
lady
of
a
sore
fever
after
she
had
once
and
again
left
her
skin
sticking
to
the
sheets
and
on
like
wise
healed
the
maid
of
her
broken

wherefore
forgetting
her
lover
from
that
time
forth
she
discreetly
forbore
both
from
making
mock
of

from
loving

the
scholar
hearing
that
the

had
broken
her
thigh
held
himself
fully
avenged

young

i
purpose
to
tell
you
a
little
story
of
a
young
man
who
received
an
injury
in
a
milder
spirit
and
avenged
it
after
a
more
moderate
fashion
by
which
you
may
understand
that

goeth
about

avenge
an
injury
suffered
it
should
suffice
him
to
give
as
good
as
he
hath
gotten

seeking
to
do

overpassing
the
behoof
of
the
feud
you
must
know
then
that
there
were
once
in
siena
as
i
have
understood
aforetime
two
young
men
in
easy
enough
case
and
of
good
city
families
whereof
one
was
named
spinelloccio
tanena
and
the
other
zeppa
di
mino
and
they
were
neighbours
in
camollia
these
two
young
men
still
companied
together
and
loved
each
other
to
all
appearance
as
they
had
been
brothers
or
better
and
each
of
them
had
a
very
fair
wife
it
chanced
that
spinelloccio
by
dint
of
much
frequenting
zeppa
house
both
when
the
latter
was
at
home
and
when
he
was
abroad
grew
so
private
with
his
wife
that
he
ended
by
lying
with
her
and
on
this
wise
they
abode
a
pretty
while
before
any
became
aware
thereof
however
at
last
one
day
zeppa
being
at
home
unknown
to
his
wife
spinelloccio
came
to
call
him
and
the
lady
said
that
he
was
abroad
whereupon
the
other
came
straightway
up
into
the
house
and
finding
her
in
the
saloon
and
seeing
none
else
there
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
fell
to
kissing
her
and
she
him
zeppa
who
saw
this
made
no
sign
but
abode
hidden
to
see
in
what
the
game
should
result
and
presently
saw
his
wife
and
spinelloccio
betake
themselves
thus
embraced
to
a
chamber
and
there
lock
themselves
in
whereat
he
was
sore
angered
but
knowing
that
his
injury
would
not
become
less
for
making
an
outcry
nor
for
otherwhat
nay
that
shame
would
but
wax
therefor
he
set
himself
to
think
what
revenge
he
should
take
thereof
so
his
soul
might
abide
content
without
the
thing
being
known
all
about
and
himseeming
after
long
consideration
he
had
found
the
means
he
abode
hidden
so
long
as
spinelloccio
remained
with
his
wife
footnote
the
street
of
that
name
as
soon
as
the
other
was
gone
away
he
entered
the
chamber
and
there
finding
the
lady
who
had
not
yet
made
an
end
of
adjusting
her
which
spinelloccio
had
plucked
down
in
dallying
with
her
said
to
her
what
dost
thou
quoth
she
thou
not
and
zeppa
answered
indeed
i
have
seen
more
than
i
could
wish
so
saying
he
taxed
her
with
that
which
had
passed
and
she
in
sore
affright
confessed
to
him
after
much
parley
that
which
she
could
not
aptly
deny
of
her
familiarity
with
spinelloccio
then
she
began
to
crave
him
pardon
weeping
and
zeppa
said
to
her
wife
thou
hast
done
ill
and
if
thou
wilt
have
me
pardon
it
to
thee
bethink
thee
punctually
to
do
that
which
i
shall
enjoin
thee
which
is
this
i
will
have
thee
bid
spinelloccio
find
an
occasion
to
part
company
with
me
morning
towards
tierce
and
come
hither
to
thee
when
he
is
here
i
will
come
back
and
so
soon
as
thou
hearest
me
do
thou
make
him
enter
this
chest
here
and
lock
him
therein
then
when
thou
shalt
have
done
this
i
will
tell
thee
what
else
thou
shalt
do
and
have
thou
no
fear
of
doing
this
for
that
i
promise
thee
i
will
do
him
no
manner
of
hurt
the
lady
to
satisfy
him
promised
to
do
his
bidding
and
so
she
did
the
morrow
come
and
zeppa
and
spinelloccio
being
together
towards
tierce
the
latter
who
had
promised
the
lady
to
be
with
her
at
that
hour
said
to
the
former
am
to
dine
this
morning
with
a
friend
whom
i
would
not
keep
waiting
for
me
wherefore
god
be
with
thee
quoth
zeppa
is
not
yet
awhile
but
spinelloccio
answered
matter
i
am
to
speak
with
him
also
of
an
affair
of
mine
so
that
needs
must
i
be
there
betimes
accordingly
taking
leave
of
him
he
fetched
a
compass
and
making
for
zeppa
house
entered
a
chamber
with
the
latter
wife
he
had
not
been
there
long
ere
zeppa
returned
whom
when
the
lady
heard
feigning
to
be
mightily
affrighted
she
made
him
take
refuge
in
the
chest
as
her
husband
had
bidden
her
and
locking
him
therein
went
forth
of
the
chamber
zeppa
coming
up
said
is
it
answered
she
quoth
he
is
gone
to
dine
this
morning
with
a
friend
of
his
and
hath
left
his
wife
alone
get
thee
to
the
window
and
call
her
and
bid
her
come
dine
with
us
the
lady
fearing
for
herself
and
grown
therefor
mighty
obedient
did
as
he
bade
her
and
spinelloccio
wife
being
much
pressed
by
her
and
hearing
that
her
own
husband
was
to
dine
abroad
came
hither
zeppa
made
much
of
her
and
whispering
his
wife
begone
into
the
kitchen
took
her
familiarly
by
the
hand
and
carried
her
into
the
chamber
wherein
no
sooner
were
they
come
than
turning
back
he
locked
the
door
within
when
the
lady
saw
him
do
this
she
said
zeppa
what
meaneth
this
have
you
then
brought
me
hither
for
this
is
this
the
love
you
bear
spinelloccio
and
the
loyal
companionship
you
practise
towards
him
whereupon
quoth
zeppa
drawing
near
to
the
chest
wherein
was
her
husband
locked
up
and
holding
her
fast
ere
thou
complainest
hearken
to
that
which
i
have
to
say
to
thee
i
have
loved
and
love
spinelloccio
as
a
brother
and
yesterday
albeit
he
knoweth
it
not
i
found
that
the
trust
i
had
in
him
was
come
to
this
that
he
lieth
with
my
wife
even
as
with
thee
now
for
that
i
love
him
i
purpose
not
to
take
vengeance
of
him
save
on
such
wise
as
the
offence
hath
been
he
hath
had
my
wife
and
i
mean
to
have
thee
an
thou
wilt
not
needs
must
i
take
him
here
and
for
that
i
mean
not
to
let
this
affront
go
unpunished
i
will
play
him
such
a
turn
that
neither
thou
nor
he
shall
ever
again
be
glad
the
lady
hearing
this
and
believing
what
zeppa
said
after
many
affirmations
made
her
of
him
replied
mine
since
this
vengeance
is
to
fall
on
me
i
am
content
so
but
thou
wilt
contrive
notwithstanding
what
we
are
to
do
that
i
may
abide
at
peace
with
thy
wife
even
as
i
intend
to
abide
with
her
notwithstanding
this
that
she
hath
done
to
me
rejoined
zeppa
will
do
it
and
to
boot
i
will
give
thee
a
precious
and
fine
jewel
as
none
other
thou
hast
so
saying
he
embraced
her
then
laying
her
flat
on
the
chest
there
to
his
heart
content
he
solaced
himself
with
her
and
she
with
him
spinelloccio
hearing
from
within
the
chest
all
that
zeppa
said
his
wife
answer
and
feeling
the
morrisdance
that
was
toward
over
his
head
was
at
first
so
sore
despited
that
himseemed
he
should
die
and
but
that
he
stood
in
fear
of
zeppa
he
had
rated
his
wife
finely
shut
up
as
he
was
however
bethinking
himself
that
the
offence
had
begun
with
him
and
that
zeppa
was
in
his
right
to
do
as
he
did
and
had
indeed
borne
himself
towards
him
humanely
and
like
a
comrade
he
presently
resolved
in
himself
to
be
an
he
would
more
than
ever
his
friend
zeppa
having
been
with
the
lady
so
long
as
it
pleased
him
dismounted
from
the
chest
and
she
asking
for
the
promised
jewel
he
opened
the
and
called
his
wife
who
said
nought
else
than
you
have
given
me
a
loaf
for
my
bannock
and
this
she
said
laughing
to
her
quoth
zeppa
this
chest
accordingly
she
opened
it
and
therein
zeppa
showed
the
lady
her
husband
saying
is
the
jewel
i
promised
thee
it
were
hard
to
say
which
was
the
more
abashed
of
the
twain
spinelloccio
seeing
zeppa
and
knowing
that
he
knew
what
he
had
done
or
his
wife
seeing
her
husband
and
knowing
that
he
had
both
heard
and
felt
that
which
she
had
done
over
his
head
but
spinelloccio
coming
forth
of
the
chest
said
without
more
parley
we
are
quits
wherefore
it
is
well
as
thou
saidst
but
now
to
my
wife
that
we
be
still
friends
as
we
were
and
that
since
there
is
nothing
unshared
between
us
two
but
our
wives
we
have
these
also
in

zeppa
was
content
and
they
all
four
dined
together
in
the
utmost
possible
harmony
and
thenceforward
each
of
the
two
ladies
had
two
husbands

he
should

took
note

them
all
up

memory

on
whom
it
occurred
to
him
more
particularly
to
cast
his
eyes
were
two
painters
of
whom
it
hath
already
twice
been
discoursed
namely
bruno
and
buffalmacco
who
were
neighbours
of
his
and
still
went
in
company
himseeming
they
recked
less
of
the
world
and
lived
more
merrily
than
other
folk
as
was
indeed
the
case
he
questioned
divers
persons
of
their
condition
and
hearing
from
all
that
they
were
poor
men
and
painters
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
it
might
not
be
they
lived
so
blithely
of
their
poverty
but
concluded
for
that
he
had
heard
they
were
shrewd
fellows
that
they
must
needs
derive
very
great
profits
from
some
source
unknown
to
the
general
wherefore
he
was
taken
with
a
desire
to
clap
up
an
acquaintance
an
he
might
with
them
both
or
at
least
with
one
of
them
and
succeeded
in
making
friends
with
bruno
the
latter
perceiving
after
he
had
been
with
him
a
few
times
that
the
physician
was
a
very

to
give
himself
the
finest
time
in

declared
that

never

what
he
should
tell

and
bruno
said
must
know
then
honey
doctor
mine
that
not
long
since
there
was
in
this
city
a
great
master
in
necromancy
who
was
called
michael
scott
for
that
he
was
of
scotland
and
who
received
the
greatest
hospitality
from
many
gentlemen
of
whom
few
are
nowadays
alive
wherefore
being
minded
to
depart
hence
he
left
them
at
their
instant
prayers
two
of
his
ablest
disciples
whom
he
enjoined
still
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
satisfy
every
wish
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
so
worshipfully
entertained
him
these
two
then
freely
served
the
aforesaid
gentlemen
in
certain
amours
of
theirs
and
other
small
matters
and
afterward
the
city
and
the
usages
of
the
folk
pleasing
them
they
determined
to
abide
there
always
accordingly
they
contracted
great
and
strait
friendship
with
certain
of
the
townfolk
regarding
not
who
they
were
whether
gentle
or
simple
rich
or
poor
but
solely
if
they
were
men
comfortable
to
their
own
usances
and
to
pleasure
these
who
were
thus
become
their
friends
they
founded
a
company
of
maybe
men
who
should
foregather
twice
at
the
least
in
the
month
in
some
place
appointed
of
them
where
being
assembled
each
should
tell
them
his
desire
which
they
would
forthright
accomplish
unto
him
for
that
night
buffalmacco
and
i
having
an
especial
friendship
and
intimacy
with
these
two
were
put
of
them
on
the
roll
of
the
aforesaid
company
and
are
still
thereof
and
i
may
tell
you
that
what
time
it
chanceth
that
we
assemble
together
it
is
a
marvellous
thing
to
see
the
hangings
about
the
saloon
where
we
eat
and
the
tables
spread
on
royal
wise
and
the
multitude
of
noble
and
goodly
servants
as
well
female
as
male
at
the
pleasure
of
each
one
who
is
of
the
company
and
the
basons
and
ewers
and
flagons
and
goblets
and
the
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
wherein
we
eat
and
drink
more
by
token
of
the
many
and
various
viands
that
are
set
before
us
each
in
its
season
according
to
that
which
each
one
desireth
i
could
never
avail
to
set
out
to
you
what
and
how
many
are
the
sweet
sounds
of
innumerable
instruments
and
the
songs
full
of
melody
that
are
heard
there
nor
might
i
tell
you
how
much
wax
is
burned
at
these
suppers
nor
what
and
how
many
are
the
confections
that
are
consumed
there
nor
how
costly
are
the

that
are
drunken

i
would
not
have
you

mine
that
we
abide
there
in
this
habit

with
these
clothes
that
you
see
us
wear
every

there
is
none
of
us

little
account

would
seem
to
you
an
emperor
so
richly
are
we
adorned
with
vestments
of
price
and
fine
things
but
over
all
the
other
pleasures
that
be
there
is
that
of
fair
ladies
who
so
one
but

it
are
incontinent
brought
thither

the
physician
who
had
been
born
and
bred
at

understood
not
their
canting

accordingly
avouched
himself
well
pleased
with
the

not
long
after
this
talk
the

brought
him
news
that
he
was
accepted
to

the
day
being
come
before
the
night
appointed
for
their
assembly
he
had
them
both
to
dinner
when
they
had
dined
he
asked
them
what
means
it
behoved
him
take
to
come
thither
whereupon
quoth
buffalmacco

will

a

horned
beast

will
go
capering
about

terrify
you

you

bytimes
do

put

on

than

wherefore
i
will
certainly
be
there
thereupon
they
took
leave
of
him
and
whenas
it
began
to
grow
towards
night
master
simone
contrived
to
make
some
excuse
or
other
to
his
wife
and
secretly
got
out
his
fine
gown
then
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
he
donned
it
and
betook
himself
to
santa
maria
novella
where
he
mounted
one
of
the
aforesaid
tombs
and
huddling
himself
up
on
the
marble
for
that
the
cold
was
great
he
proceeded
to
wait
the
coming
of
the
beast
meanwhile
buffalmacco
who
was
tall
and
robust
of
his
person
made
shift
to
have
one
of
those
masks
that
were
wont
to
be
used
for
certain
games
which
are
not
held
nowadays
and
donning
a
black
fur
pelisse
inside
out
arrayed
himself
therein
on
such
wise
that
he
seemed
a
very
bear
save
that
his
mask
had
a
devil
face
and
was
horned
thus
accoutred
he
betook
himself
to
the
new
piazza
of
santa
maria
bruno
following
him
to
see
how
the
thing
should
go
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
the
physician
was
there
he
fell
and
caracoling
and
made
a
terrible
great
blustering
about
the
piazza
whistling
and
howling
and
bellowing
as
he
were
possessed
of
the
devil
when
master
simone
who
was
more
fearful
than
a
woman
heard
and
saw
this
every
hair
of
his
body
stood
on
end
and
he
fell
all
over
and
it
was
now
he
had
liefer
been
at
home
than
there
nevertheless
since
he
was
there
he
enforced
himself
to
take
heart
so
overcome
was
he
with
desire
to
see
the
marvels
whereof
the
painters
had
told
him
after
buffalmacco
had
raged
about
awhile
as
hath
been
said
he
made
a
show
of
growing
pacified
and
coming
up
to
the
tomb
whereon
was
the
physician
stood
master
simone
who
was
all
for
fear
knew
not
what
to
do
whether
to
mount
or
abide
where
he
was
however
at
last
fearing
that
the
beast
should
do
him
a
mischief
an
he
mounted
him
not
he
did
away
the
first
fear
with
the
second
and
coming
down
from
the
tomb
mounted
on
his
back
saying
softly
aid
me
then
he
settled
himself
as
best
he
might
and
still
trembling
in
every
limb
crossed
his
hands
upon
his
breast
as
it
had
been
enjoined
him
whereupon
buffalmacco
set
off
at
an
amble
towards
santa
maria
della
scala
and
going
on
all
fours
brought
him
hard
by
the
nunnery
of
ripole
in
those
days
there
were
dykes
in
that
quarter
wherein
the
tillers
of
the
neighbouring
lands
let
empty
the
jakes
to
manure
their
fields
withal
whereto
whenas
buffalmacco
came
nigh
he
went
up
to
the
brink
of
one
of
them
and
taking
the
opportunity
laid
hold
of
one
of
the
physician
legs
and
jerking
him
off
his
back
pitched
him
clean
in
head
foremost
then
he
fell
and
snarling
and
capering
and
raged
about
awhile
after
which
he
made
off
alongside
santa
maria
della
scala
till
he
came
to
allhallows
fields
there
he
found
bruno
who
had
taken
to
flight
for
that
he
was
unable
to
restrain
his
laughter
and
with
him
after
they
had
made
merry
together
at
master
simone
expense
he
addressed
himself
to
see
from
afar
what
the
bemoiled
physician
should
do
my
lord
leech
finding
himself
in
that
abominable
place
struggled
to
arise
and
strove
as
best
he
might
to
win
forth
thereof
and
after
falling
in
again
and
again
now
here
and
now
there
and
swallowing
some
drachms
of
the
filth
he
at
last
succeeded
in
making
his
way
out
of
the
dyke
in
the
woefullest
of
plights
bewrayed
from
head
to
foot
and
leaving
his
bonnet
behind
him
then
having
wiped
himself
as
best
he
might
with
his
hands
and
knowing
not
what
other
course
to
take
he
returned
home
and
knocked
till
it
was
opened
to
him
hardly
was
he
entered
stinking
as
he
did
and
the
door
shut
again
ere
up
came
bruno
and
buffalmacco
to
hear
how
he
should
be
received
of
his
wife
and
standing
hearkening
they
heard
the
lady
give
him
the
foulest
rating
was
ever
given
poor
devil
saying
lack
what
a
pickle
thou
art
in
thou
hast
been
gallanting
it
to
some
other
woman
and
must
needs
seek
to
cut
a
figure
with
thy
gown
of
scarlet
what
was
not
i
enough
for
thee
why
man
alive
i
could
suffice
to
a
whole
people
let
alone
thee
would
god
they
had
choked
thee
like
as
they
cast
thee
whereas
thou
deservedst
to
be
thrown
here
a
fine
physician
for
you
to
have
a
wife
of
his
own
and
go
anights
after
other
womankind
and
with
these
and
many
other
words
of
the
same
fashion
she
gave
not
over
tormenting
him
till
midnight
what
while
the
physician
let
wash
himself
from
head
to
foot
next
morning
up
came
bruno
and
buffalmacco
who
had
painted
all
their
flesh
under
their
clothes
with
livid
blotches
such
as
beatings
use
to
make
and
entering
the
physician
house
found
him
already
arisen
accordingly
they
went
in
to
him
and
found
the
whole
place
full
of
stench
for
that
they
had
not
yet
been
able
so
to
clean
everything
that
it
should
not
stink
there
master
simone
seeing
them
enter
came
to
meet
them
and
bade
god
give
them
good
day
whereto
the
two
rogues
as
they
had
agreed
beforehand
replied
with
an
angry
air
saying
say
we
not
to
you
nay
rather
we
pray
god
give
you
so
many
ill
years
that
you
may
die
a
dog
death
as
the
most
disloyal
man
and
the
vilest
traitor
alive
for
it
was
no
thanks
to
you
that
whereas
we
studied
to
do
you
pleasure
and
worship
we
were
not
slain
like
dogs
as
it
is
thanks
to
your
disloyalty
we
have
gotten
so
many
buffets
this
past
night
that
an
ass
would
go
to
rome
for
less
without
reckoning
that
we
have
gone
in
danger
of
being
expelled
the
company
into
which
we
had
taken
order
for
having
you
received
an
you
believe
us
not
look
at
our
bodies
and
see
how
they
have
fared
then
opening
their
clothes
in
front
they
showed
him
by
an
uncertain
light
their
breasts
all
painted
and
covered
them
up
again
in
haste
the
physician
would
have
excused
himself
and
told
of
his
mishaps
and
how
and
where
he
had
been
cast
but
buffalmacco
said
he
had
thrown
you
off
the
bridge
into
the
arno
why
did
you
call
on
god
and
the
saints
were
you
not
forewarned
of
this
god
his
faith
replied
the
physician
did
it
not
cried
buffalmacco
did
not
call
on
them
egad
you
did
it
again
and
again
for
our
messenger
told
us
that
you
shook
like
a
reed
and
knew
not
where
you
were
marry
for
the
nonce
you
have
befooled
us
finely
but
never
again
shall
any
one
serve
us
thus
and
we
will
yet
do
you
such
honour
thereof
as
you
merit
the
physician
fell
to
craving
pardon
and
conjuring
them
for
god
sake
not
to
dishonour
him
and
studied
to
appease
them
with
the
best
words
he
could
command
and
if
aforetime
he
had
entreated
them
with
honour
from
that
time
forth
he
honoured
them
yet
more
and
made
much
of
them
entertaining
them
with
banquets
and
otherwhat
for
fear
lest
they
should
publish
his
shame

cozened
by

of

used

all

who
come

with
merchandise
having

it
should
carry

what
he
is
worth
it
chanced
not
long
since
that
there
came
thither
sent
by
his
masters
one
of
our
young
florentines
by
name
niccolo
da
cignano
though
more
commonly
called
salabaetto
with
as
many
woollen
cloths
left
on
his
hands
from
the
salerno
fair
as
might
be
worth
some
five
hundred
gold
florins
which
having
given
the
customhouse
officers
the
invoice
thereof
he
laid
up
in
a
magazine
and
began
without
showing
overmuch
haste
to
dispose
of
them
to
go
bytimes
about
the
city
he
being
of
a
fair
complexion
and
and
withal
very
sprightly
and
personable
it
chanced
that
one
of
these
same
barberesses
who
styled
herself
madam
biancofiore
having
heard
somewhat
of
his
affairs
cast
her
eyes
on
him
which
he
perceiving
and
taking
her
for
some
great
lady
concluded
that
he
pleased
her
for
his
good
looks
and
bethought
himself
to
order
this
amour
with
the
utmost
secrecy
wherefore
without
saying
aught
thereof
to
any
he
fell
to
passing
and
repassing
before
her
house
she
noting
this
after
she
had
for
some
days
well
enkindled
him
with
her
eyes
making
believe
to
languish
for
him
privily
despatched
to
him
one
of
her
women
who
was
a
past
mistress
in
the
procuring
art
and
who
after
much
parley
told
him
well
nigh
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
he
had
so
taken
her
mistress
with
his
comeliness
and
his
pleasing
fashions
that
she
could
find
no
rest
day
or
night
wherefore
whenas
it
pleased
him
she
desired
more
than
aught
else
to
avail
to
foregather
with
him
privily
in
a
bagnio
then
pulling
a
ring
from
her
pouch
she
gave
it
to
him
on
the
part
of
her
mistress
salabaetto
hearing
this
was
the
joyfullest
man
that
was
aye
and
taking
the
ring
rubbed
it
against
his
eyes
and
kissed
it
after
which
he
set
it
on
his
finger
and
replied
to
the
good
woman
that
if
madam
biancofiore
loved
him
she
was
well
requited
it
for
that
he
loved
her
more
than
his
proper
life
and
was
ready
to
go
whereassoever
it
should
please
her
and
at
any
hour
the
messenger
returned
to
her
mistress
with
this
answer
and
it
was
appointed
salabaetto
out
of
hand
at
what
bagnio
he
should
expect
her
on
the
ensuing
day
after
vespers
accordingly
without
saying
aught
of
the
matter
to
any
he
punctually
repaired
thither
at
the
hour
appointed
him
and
found
the
bagnio
taken
by
the
lady
nor
had
he
waited
long
ere
there
came
two
laden
with
gear
and
bearing
on
their
heads
the
one
a
fine
large
mattress
of
cotton
wool
and
the
other
a
great
basket
full
of
gear
the
mattress
they
set
on
a
bedstead
in
one
of
the
chambers
of
the
bagnio
and
spread
thereon
a
pair
of
very
fine
sheets
laced
with
silk
together
with
a
counterpane
of
cyprus
buckram
and
two
pillows
wrought
then
putting
off
their
clothes
they
entered
the
bath
and
swept
it
all
and
washed
it
excellent
well
nor
was
it
long
ere
the
lady
herself
came
thither
with
other
two
and
accosted
salabaetto
with
the
utmost
joy
then
as
first
she
had
commodity
after
she
had
both
clipped
and
kissed
him
amain
heaving
the
heaviest
sighs
in
the
world
she
said
to
him
know
not
who
could
have
brought
me
to
this
pass
other
than
thou
thou
hast
kindled
a
fire
in
my
vitals
little
dog
of
a
tuscan
then
at
her
instance
they
entered
the
bath
both
naked
and
with
them
two
of
the
and
there
without
letting
any
else
lay
a
finger
on
him
she
with
her
own
hands
washed
salabaetto
all
with
musk
and
soap
after
which
she
let
herself
be
washed
and
rubbed
of
the
this
done
the
latter
brought
two
very
white
and
fine
sheets
whence
came
so
great
a
scent
of
roses
that
everything
there
seemed
roses
in
one
of
which
they
wrapped
salabaetto
and
in
the
other
the
lady
and
taking
them
in
their
arms
carried
them
both
to
the
bed
prepared
for
them
there
whenas
they
had
left
sweating
the
did
them
loose
from
the
sheets
wherein
they
were
wrapped
and
they
abode
naked
in
the
others
whilst
the
girls
brought
out
of
the
basket
of
silver
full
of
sweet
waters
rose
and
jessamine
and
orange
and
scented
and
sprinkled
them
all
therewith
after
which
boxes
of
succades
and
wines
of
great
price
were
produced
and
they
refreshed
themselves
awhile

the
word
buckram

anciently
applied

in
needlework
it
seemed
to
salabaetto
as
he
were
in
paradise
and
he
cast
a
thousand
glances
at
the
lady
who
was
certes
very
handsome
himseeming
each
hour
was
an
hundred
years
till
the
should
begone
and
he
should
find
himself
in
her
arms
presently
at
her
commandment
the
girls
departed
the
chamber
leaving
a
flambeau
alight
there
whereupon
she
embraced
salabaetto
and
he
her
and
they
abode
together
a
great
while
to
the
exceeding
pleasure
of
the
florentine
to
whom
it
seemed
she
was
all
afire
for
love
of
him
whenas
it
seemed
to
her
time
to
rise
she
called
the
and
they
clad
themselves
then
they
recruited
themselves
somedele
with
a
second
collation
of
wine
and
sweetmeats
and
washed
their
hands
and
faces
with
odoriferous
waters
after
which
being
about
to
depart
the
lady
said
to
salabaetto
it
be
agreeable
to
thee
it
were
doing
me
a
very
great
favour
an
thou
camest
this
evening
to
sup
and
lie
the
night
with
me
salabaetto
who
was
by
this
time
altogether
captivated
by
her
beauty
and
the
artful
pleasantness
of
her
fashions
and
firmly
believed
himself
to
be
loved
of
her
as
he
were
the
heart
out
of
her
body
replied
your
every
pleasure
is
supremely
agreeable
to
me
wherefore
both
and
at
all
times
i
mean
to
do
that
which
shall
please
you
and
that
which
shall
be
commanded
me
of
you
accordingly
the
lady
returned
to
her
house
where
she
caused
well
bedeck
her
bedchamber
with
her
dresses
and
gear
and
letting
make
ready
a
splendid
supper
awaited
salabaetto
who
as
soon
as
it
was
grown
somewhat
dark
betook
himself
thither
and
being
received
with
open
arms
supped
with
all
cheer
and
commodity
of
service
thereafter
they
betook
themselves
into
the
bedchamber
where
he
smelt
a
marvellous
fragrance
of
and
saw
the
bed
very
richly
adorned
with
cyprian
and
store
of
fine
dresses
upon
the
pegs
all
which
things
together
and
each
of
itself
made
him
conclude
that
this
must
be
some
great
and
rich
lady
and
although
he
had
heard
some
whispers
to
the
contrary
anent
her
manner
of
life
he
would
not
anywise
believe
it
or
if
he
gave
so
much
credit
thereto
as
to
allow
that
she
might
erst
have
cozened
others
for
nothing
in
the
world
could
he
have
believed
that
this
might
possibly
happen
to
himself
he
lay
that
night
with
her
in
the
utmost
delight
still
waxing
more
enamoured
and
in
the
morning
she
girt
him
on
a
quaint
and
goodly
girdle
of
silver
with
a
fine
purse
thereto
saying
my
salabaetto
i
commend
myself
to
thy
remembrance
and
like
as
my
person
is
at
thy
pleasure
even
so
is
all
that
is
here
and
all
that
dependeth
upon
me
at
thy
service
and
commandment
salabaetto
rejoiced
embraced
and
kissed
her
then
going
forth
of
her
house
he
betook
himself
whereas
the
other
merchants
were
used
to
resort
footnote
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
to
attach
to
the
bedposts
sundry
small
instruments
in
the
form
of
birds
which
by
means
of
certain
mechanical
devices
gave
forth
sounds
modulated
like
the
song
of
actual
birds
on
this
wise
consorting
with
her
at
one
time
and
another
without
its
costing
him
aught
in
the
world
and
growing
every
hour
more
entangled
it
befell
that
he
sold
his
stuffs
for
ready
money
and
made
a
good
profit
thereby
of
which
the
lady
incontinent
heard
not
from
him
but
from
others
and
salabaetto
being
come
one
night
to
visit
her
she
fell
to
prattling
and
wantoning
with
him
kissing
and
clipping
him
and
feigning
herself
so
enamoured
of
him
that
it
seemed
she
must
die
of
love
in
his
arms
moreover
she
would
fain
have
given
him
two
very
fine
hanaps
of
silver
that
she
had
but
he
would
not
take
them
for
that
he
had
had
of
her
at
one
time
and
another
what
was
worth
a
good
thirty
gold
florins
without
availing
to
have
her
take
of
him
so
much
as
a
groat
worth
at
last
whenas
she
had
well
enkindled
him
by
showing
herself
so
enamoured
and
freehanded
one
of
her
called
her
as
she
had
ordained
beforehand
whereupon
she
left
the
chamber
and
coming
back
after
awhile
in
tears
cast
herself
face
downward
on
the
bed
and
fell
to
making
the
woefullest
lamentation
ever
woman
made
salabaetto
marvelling
at
this
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
fell
with
her
and
saying
heart
of
my
body
what
aileth
thee
thus
suddenly
what
is
the
cause
of
this
grief
for
sake
tell
it
me
my
soul
the
lady
after
letting
herself
be
long
entreated
answered
me
sweet
my
lord
i
know
not
what
to
say
or
to
do
i
have
but
now
received
letters
from
messina
and
my
brother
writeth
me
that
should
i
sell
or
pawn
all
that
is
here
i
must
without
fail
send
him
a
thousand
gold
florins
within
eight
days
from
this
time
else
will
his
head
be
cut
off
and
i
know
not
how
i
shall
do
to
get
this
sum
so
suddenly
had
i
but
fifteen
days
grace
i
would
find
a
means
of
procuring
it
from
a
certain
quarter
whence
i
am
to
have
much
more
or
i
would
sell
one
of
our
farms
but
as
this
may
not
be
i
had
liefer
be
dead
than
that
this
ill
news
should
have
come
to
me

syn
that
which
belongeth
to
us
che
ci
as
i
have
before
noted
signifying
both
here
and
us
dative
and
accusative
so
saying
she
made
a
show
of
being
sore
afflicted
and
stinted
not
from
weeping
whereupon
quoth
salabaetto
whom
the
flames
of
love
had
bereft
of
great
part
of
his
wonted
good
sense
so
that
he
believed
her
tears
to
be
true
and
her
words
truer
yet
i
can
not
oblige
you
with
a
thousand
florins
but
five
hundred
i
can
very
well
advance
you
since
you
believe
you
will
be
able
to
return
them
to
me
within
a
fortnight
from
this
time
and
this
is
of
your
good
fortune
that
i
chanced
but
yesterday
to
sell
my
stuffs
for
had
it
not
been
so
i
could
not
have
lent
you

groat
cried
the
lady
thou
then

straitened
for
lack

why
didst
thou
not
require
me
thereof
though
i
have
not
a
thousand
i
had
an
hundred
and
even
two
hundred
to
give
thee
thou
hast
deprived
me
of
all
heart
to
accept
of
thee
the
service
thou
profferest
me
salabaetto
was
more
than
ever
taken
with
these
words
and
said
i
would
not
have
you
refrain
on
that
account
for
had
i
had
such
an
occasion
therefor
as
you
presently
have
i
would
assuredly
have
asked
you
salabaetto
mine
replied
the
lady
know
i
aright
that
thine
is
a
true
and
perfect
love
for
me
since
without
waiting
to
be
required
thou
freely
succoureth
me
in
such
a
strait
with
so
great
a
sum
of
money
certes
i
was
all
thine
without
this
but
with
this
i
shall
be
far
more
so
nor
shall
i
ever
forget
that
i
owe
thee
my
life
but
god
knoweth
i
take
it
sore
unwillingly
seeing
that
thou
art
a
merchant
and
that
with
money
merchants
transact
all
their
affairs
however
since
need
constraineth
me
and
i
have
certain
assurance
of
speedily
restoring
it
to
thee
i
will
take
it
and
for
the
rest
an
i
find
no
readier
means
i
will
pawn
all
these
my
possessions
so
saying
she
let
herself
fall
weeping
on

neck
he
fell
to
comforting
her
and
after
abiding

received

in

eyes
but
laughter
in
her
heart
salabaetto
contenting
himself
with
her
simple
promise
as
soon
as
the
lady
had
the
money
the
signs
began
to
change
and
whereas
before
he
had
free
access
to
her
whenassoever
it
pleased
him
reasons
now
began
to
crop
up
whereby
it
betided
him
not
to
win
admission
there
once
out
of
seven
times
nor
was
he
received
with
the
same
countenance
nor
the
same
caresses
and
rejoicings
as
before
and
the
term
at
which
he
was
to
have
had
his
monies
again
being
not
to
say
come
but
past
by
a
month
or
two
and
he
requiring
them
words
were
given
him
in
payment
thereupon
his
eyes
were
opened
to
the
wicked
woman
arts
and
his
own
lack
of
wit
wherefore
feeling
that
he
could
say
nought
of
her
beyond
that
which
might
please
her
concerning
the
matter
since
he
had
neither
script
nor
other
evidence
thereof
and
being
ashamed
to
complain
to
any
as
well
for
that
he
had
been
forewarned
thereof
as
for
fear
of
the
scoffs
which
he
might
reasonably
expect
for
his
folly
he
was
beyond
measure
woeful
and
inwardly
bewailed
his
credulity
at
last
having
had
divers
letters
from
his
masters
requiring
him
to
change
the
monies
in
question
and
remit
them
to
them
he
determined
to
depart
lest
an
he
did
it
not
his
default
should
be
discovered
there
and
accordingly
going
aboard
a
little
ship
he
betook
himself
not
to
pisa
as
he
should
have
done
but
to
naples

wit
and
a
fast
friend
of
salabaetto
and
his
family
and
to
him
as
to
a
very
discreet
man
the
disconsolate
florentine
recounted
that
which
he
had
done
and
the
mischance
that
had
befallen
him
requiring
him
of
aid
and
counsel
so
he
might
contrive
to
gain
his
living
there
and
avouching
his
intention
nevermore
to
return
to
florence
canigiano
was
concerned
for
this
and
said
hast
thou
done
and
ill
hast
thou
carried
thyself
thou
hast
disobeyed
thy
masters
and
hast
at
one
cast
spent
a
great
sum
of
money
in
wantonness
but
since
it
is
done
we
must
look
for
otherwhat
accordingly
like
a
shrewd
man
as
he
was
he
speedily
bethought
himself
what
was
to
be
done
and
told
it
to
salabaetto
who
was
pleased
with
the
device
and
set
about
putting
it
in
execution
he
had
some
money
and
canigiano
having
lent
him
other
some
he
made
up
a
number
of
bales
well
packed
and
corded
then
buying
a
score
of
and
filling
them
he
embarked
the
whole
and
returned
to
palermo
where
having
given
the
customhouse
officers
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
value
of
the
casks
and
let
enter
everything
to
his
account
he
laid
the
whole
up
in
the
magazines
saying
that
he
meant
not
to
touch
them
till
such
time
as
certain
other
merchandise
which
he
expected
should
be
come
footnote
procure
bills
of
exchange
for
footnote
we
must
see
what
is
to
be
done
biancofiore
getting
wind
of
this
and
hearing
that
the
merchandise
he
had
presently
brought
with
him
was
worth
good
two
thousand
florins
without
reckoning
what
he
looked
for
which
was
valued
at
more
than
three
thousand
bethought
herself
that
she
had
flown
at
too
small
game
and
determined
to
restore
him
the
five
hundred
florins
so
she
might
avail
to
have
the
greater
part
of
the
five
thousand
accordingly
she
sent
for
him
and
salabaetto
grown
cunning
went
to
her
whereupon
making
believe
to
know
nothing
of
that
which
he
had
brought
with
him
she
received
him
with
a
great
show
of
fondness
and
said
to
him
if
thou
wast
vexed
with
me
for
that
i
repaid
thee
not
thy
monies
on
the
very
day
salabaetto
fell
and
answered
truth
madam
it
did
somewhat
displease
me
seeing
i
would
have
torn
out
my
very
heart
to
give
it
you
an
i
thought
to
pleasure
you
withal
but
i
will
have
you
hear
how
i
am
vexed
with
you
such
and
so
great
is
the
love
i
bear
you
that
i
have
sold
the
most
part
of
my
possessions
and
have
presently
brought
hither
merchandise
to
the
value
of
more
than
two
thousand
florins
and
expect
from
the
westward
as
much
more
as
will
be
worth
over
three
thousand
with
which
i
mean
to
stock
me
a
warehouse
in
this
city
and
take
up
my
sojourn
here
so
i
may
still
be
near
you
meseeming
i
fare
better
of
your
love
than
ever
lover
of
his
lady
you
salabaetto
answered
the
lady
commodity
of
thine
is
mighty
pleasing
to
me
as
that
of
him
whom
i
love
more
than
my
life
and
it
pleaseth
me
amain
that
thou
art
returned
hither
with
intent
to
sojourn
here
for
that
i
hope
yet
to
have
good
time
galore
with
thee
but
i
would
fain
excuse
myself
somedele
to
thee
for
that
whenas
thou
wast
about
to
depart
thou
wouldst
bytimes
have
come
hither
and
couldst
not
and
whiles
thou
camest
and
wast
not
so
gladly
seen
as
thou
wast
used
to
be
more
by
token
that
i
returned
thee
not
thy
monies
at
the
time
promised
thou
must
know
that
i
was
then
in
very
great
concern
and
sore
affliction
and
whoso
is
in
such
case
how
much
soever
he
may
love
another
can
not
always
show
him
so
cheerful
a
countenance
or
pay
him
such
attention
as
he
might
wish
moreover
thou
must
know
that
it
is
mighty
uneasy
for
a
woman
to
avail
to
find
a
thousand
gold
florins
all
day
long
we
are
put
off
with
lies
and
that
which
is
promised
us
is
not
performed
unto
us
wherefore
needs
must
we
in
our
turn
lie
unto
others
hence
cometh
it
and
not
of
my
default
that
i
gave
thee
not
back
thy
monies
however
i
had
them
a
little
after
thy
departure
and
had
i
known
whither
to
send
them
thou
mayst
be
assured
that
i
would
have
remitted
them
to
thee
but
not
knowing
this
i
kept
them
for
thee
then
letting
fetch
a
purse
wherein
were
the
very
monies
he
had
brought
her
she
put
it
into
his
hand
saying
them
if
there
be
five
hundred
never
was
salabaetto
so
glad
he
counted
them
and
finding
them
five
hundred
put
them
up
and
said
i
am
assured
that
you
say
sooth
but
you
have
done
enough
to
convince
me
of
your
love
for
me
and
i
tell
you
that
for
this
and
for
the
love
i
bear
you
you
could
never
require
me
for
any
your
occasion
of
whatsoever
sum
i
might
command
but
i
would
oblige
you
therewith
and
whenas
i
am
established
here
you
may
put
this
to
the
proof
having
again
on
this
wise
renewed
his
loves
with
her
in
words
he
fell
again
to
using
amically
with
her
whilst
she
made
much
of
him
and
showed
him
the
greatest
goodwill
and
honour
in
the
world
feigning
the
utmost
love
for
him
but
he
having
a
mind
to
return
her
cheat
for
cheat
being
one
day
sent
for
by
her
to
sup
and
sleep
with
her
went
thither
so
chapfallen
and
so
woebegone
that
it
seemed
as
he
would
die
biancofiore
embracing
him
and
kissing
him
began
to
question
him
of
what
ailed
him
to
be
thus
melancholy
and
he
after
letting
himself
be
importuned
a
good
while
answered
am
a
ruined
man
for
that
the
ship
wherein
is
the
merchandise
i
expected
hath
been
taken
by
the
corsairs
of
monaco
and
held
to
ransom
in
ten
thousand
gold
florins
whereof
it
falleth
to
me
to
pay
a
thousand
and
i
have
not
a
farthing
for
that
the
five
hundred
pieces
thou
returnedst
to
me
i
sent
incontinent
to
naples
to
lay
out
in
cloths
to
be
brought
hither
and
should
i
go
about
at
this
present
to
sell
the
merchandise
i
have
here
i
should
scarce
get
a
penny
for
two
pennyworth
for
that
it
is
no
time
for
selling
nor
am
i
yet
so
well
known
that
i
could
find
any
here
to
help
me
to
this
wherefore
i
know
not
what
to
do
or
to
say
for
if
i
send
not
the
monies
speedily
the
merchandise
will
be
carried
off
to
monaco
and
i
shall
never
again
have
aught
thereof
the
lady
was
mightily
concerned
at
this
fearing
to
lose
him
altogether
and
considering
how
she
should
do
so
he
might
not
go
to
monaco
said
knoweth
i
am
sore
concerned
for
the
love
of
thee
but
what
availeth
it
to
afflict
oneself
thus
if
i
had
the
monies
god
knoweth
i
would
lend
them
to
thee
incontinent
but
i
have
them
not
true
there
is
a
certain
person
here
who
obliged
me
the
other
day
with
the
five
hundred
florins
that
i
lacked
but
he
will
have
heavy
usance
for
his
monies
nay
he
requireth
no
less
than
thirty
in
the
hundred
and
if
thou
wilt
borrow
of
him
needs
must
he
be
made
secure
with
a
good
pledge
for
my
part
i
am
ready
to
engage
for
thee
all
these
my
goods
and
my
person
to
boot
for
as
much
as
he
will
lend
thereon
but
how
wilt
thou
assure
him
of
the
rest
salabaetto
readily
apprehended
the
reason
that
moved
her
to
do
him
this
service
and
divined
that
it
was
she
herself
who
was
to
lend
him
the
money
wherewith
he
was
well
pleased
and
thanking
her
answered
that
he
would
not
be
put
off
for
exorbitant
usance
need
constraining
him
moreover
he
said
that
he
would
give
assurance
of
the
merchandise
he
had
in
the
customhouse
letting
inscribe
it
to
him
who
should
lend
him
the
money
but
that
needs
must
be
kept
the
key
of
the
magazines
as
well
that
he
might
be
able
to
show
his
wares
an
it
were
required
of
him
as
that
nothing
might
be
touched
or
changed
or
tampered
withal
the
lady
answered
that
it
was
well
said
and
that
this
was
good
enough
assurance
wherefore
as
soon
as
the
day
was
come
she
sent
for
a
broker
in
whom
she
trusted
greatly
and
taking
order
with
him
of
the
matter
gave
him
a
thousand
gold
florins
which
he
lent
to
salabaetto
letting
inscribe
in
his
own
name
at
the
customhouse
that
which
the
latter
had
there
then
having
made
their
writings
and
together
and
being
come
to
an
accord
they
occupied
themselves
with
their
other
affairs
salabaetto
as
soonest
he
might
embarked
with
the
fifteen
hundred
gold
florins
on
board
a
little
ship
and
returned
to
pietro
dello
canigiano
at
naples
whence
he
remitted
to
his
masters
who
had
despatched
him
with
the
stuffs
a
good
and
entire
account
thereof
then
having
repaid
pietro
and
every
other
to
whom
he
owed
aught
he
made
merry
several
days
with
canigiano
over
the
cheat
he
had
put
upon
the
sicilian
trickstress
after
which
resolved
to
be
no
more
a
merchant
he
betook
himself
to
ferrara
footnote
having
executed
and
exchanged
the
necessary
legal
documents
for
the
proper
carrying
out
of
the
transaction
and
completed
the
matter
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
meanwhile
biancofiore
finding
that
salabaetto
had
left
palermo
began
to
marvel
and
wax
misdoubtful
and
after
having
awaited
him
good
two
months
seeing
that
he
came
not
she
caused
the
broker
force
open
the
magazines
trying
first
the
casks
which
she
believed
to
be
filled
with
oil
she
found
them
full
of
seawater
save
that
there
was
in
each
maybe
a
runlet
of
oil
at
the
top
near
the
bunghole
then
undoing
the
bales
she
found
them
all
full
of
tow
with
the
exception
of
two
which
were
stuffs
and
in
brief
with
all
that
was
there
there
was
not
more
than
two
hundred
florins
worth
wherefore
biancofiore
confessing
herself
outwitted
long
lamented
the
five
hundred
florins
repaid
and
yet
more
the
thousand
lent
saying
often
with
a
tuscan
hath
to
do
must
nor
be
blind
nor
see
askew
on
this
wise
having
gotten
nothing
for
her
pains
but
loss
and
scorn
she
found
to
her
cost
that
some
folk
know
as
much
as
others
no
sooner
had
dioneo
made
an
end
of
his
story
than
lauretta
knowing
the
term
to
be
come
beyond
which
she
was
not
to
reign
and
having
commended
canigiano
counsel
which
was
approved
good
by
its
effect
and
salabaetto
shrewdness
which
was
no
less
commendable
in
carrying
it
into
execution
lifted
the
laurel
from
her
own
head
and
set
it
on
that
of
emilia
saying
with
womanly
grace
madam
i
know
not
how
pleasant
a
queen
we
shall
have
of
you
but
at
the
least
we
shall
have
a
fair
one
look
then
that
your
actions
be
conformable
to
your
beauties
so
saying
she
returned
to
her
seat
whilst
emilia
a
thought
abashed
not
so
much
at
being
made
queen
as
to
see
herself
publicly
commended
of
that
which
women
use
most
to
covet
waxed
such
in
face
as
are
the
roses
in
the
dawning
however
after
she
had
kept
her
eyes
awhile
lowered
till
the
redness
had
given
place
she
took
order
with
the
seneschal
of
that
which
concerned
the
general
entertainment
and
presently
said
delightsome
ladies
it
is
common
after
oxen
have
toiled
some
part
of
the
day
confined
under
the
yoke
to
see
them
loosed
and
eased
thereof
and
freely
suffered
to
go
where
most
it
liketh
them
about
the
woods
and
it
is
manifest
also
that
leafy
gardens
embowered
with
various
plants
are
not
less
but
much
more
fair
than
groves
wherein
one
seeth
only
oaks
wherefore
seeing
how
many
days
we
have
discoursed
under
the
restraint
of
a
fixed
law
i
opine
that
as
well
unto
us
as
to
those
whom
need
constraineth
to
labour
for
their
daily
bread
it
is
not
only
useful
but
necessary
to
play
the
truant
awhile
and
wandering
thus
afield
to
regain
strength
to
enter
anew
under
the
yoke
wherefore
for
that
which
is
to
be
related
ensuing
your
delectable
usance
of
discourse
i
purpose
not
to
restrict
you
to
any
special
subject
but
will
have
each
discourse
according
as
it
pleaseth
him
holding
it
for
certain
that
the
variety
of
the
things
which
will
be
said
will
afford
us
no
less
entertainment
than
to
have
discoursed
of
one
alone
and
having
done
thus
whoso
shall
come
after
me
in
the
sovranty
may
as
stronger
than
i
avail
with
greater
assurance
to
restrict
us
within
the
limits
of
the
wonted
laws
so
saying
she
set
every
one
at
liberty
till
all
commended
the
queen
of
that
which
she
had
said
holding
it
sagely
spoken
and
rising
to
their
feet
addressed
themselves
this
to
one
kind
of
diversion
and
that
to
another
the
ladies
to
weaving
garlands
and
to
gambolling
and
the
young
men
to
gaming
and
singing
on
this
wise
they
passed
the
time
until
the
which
being
come
they
supped
with
mirth
and
good
cheer
about
the
fair
fountain
and
after
diverted
themselves
with
singing
and
dancing
according
to
the
wonted
usance
at
last
the
queen
to
ensue
the
fashion
of
her
predecessors
commanded
pamfilo
to
sing
a
song
notwithstanding
those
which
sundry
of
the
company
had
already
sung
of
their
freewill
and
he
readily
began
thus
such
is
thy
pleasure
love
and
such
the
allegresse
i
feel
thereby
that
happy
burning
in
thy
fire
am
i
the
abounding
gladness
in
my
heart
that
glows
for
the
high
joy
and
dear
whereto
thou
hast
me
led
unable
to
contain
there
overflows
and
in
my
face
cheer
displays
my
happihead
for
being
enamour√©d
in
such
a
place
and
high
makes
eath
to
me
the
burning
i
aby
i
can
not
with
my
finger
what
i
feel
limn
love
nor
do
i
know
my
bliss
in
song
to
vent
nay
though
i
knew
it
needs
must
i
conceal
for
once
divulged
i
trow
turn
to
dreariment
yet
am
i
so
content
all
speech
were
halt
and
feeble
did
i
try
the
least
thereof
with
words
to
signify
who
might
conceive
it
that
these
arms
of
mine
should
anywise
attain
whereas
i
held
them
aye
or
that
my
face
should
reach
so
fair
a
shrine
as
that
of
favour
fain
and
grace
i
won
to
nay
such
fortune
a
day
believed
me
were
whence
all
afire
am
i
hiding
the
source
of
my
liesse
thereby
this
was
the
end
of
pamfilo
song
whereto
albeit
it
had
been
completely
responded
of
all
there
was
none
but
noted
the
words
thereof
with
more
attent
solicitude
than
pertained
unto
him
studying
to
divine
that
which
as
he
sang
it
behoved
him
to
keep
hidden
from
them
and
although
sundry
went
imagining
various
things
nevertheless
none
happened
upon
the
truth
of
the
case
but
the
queen
seeing
that
the
song
was
ended
and
that
both
young
ladies
and
men
would
gladly
rest
themselves
commanded
that
all
should
betake
themselves
to
bed

song

lift
their

along

emilia
uprising
let
call
the

her
comrades
and
on
like
wise
the
young
men
who
being
come
fared
forth
ensuing
the
slow
steps
of
the
queen
and
betook
themselves
to
a
coppice
but
little
distant
from
the
palace
therein
entering
they
saw
the
animals
wild
goats
and
deer
and
others
as
if
assured
of
security
from
the
hunters
by
reason
of
the
prevailing
pestilence
stand
awaiting
them
no
otherwise
than
as
they
were
grown
without
fear
or
tame
and
diverted
themselves
awhile
with
them
drawing
near
now
to
this
one
and
now
to
that
as
if
they
would
fain
lay
hands
on
them
and
making
them
run

skip
but
the
sun
now
waxing
high
they
deemed
it
well
to
turn
back
they
were
all
garlanded
with
oak
leaves
with
their
hands
full
of
flowers
and
herbs
and
whoso
encountered
them
had
said
no
otherwhat
than
or
these
shall
not
be
overcome
of
death
or
it
will
slay
them
merry
on
this
wise
then
they
fared
on
step
by
step
singing
and
chatting
and
laughing
till
they
came
to
the
palace
where
they
found
everything
orderly
disposed
and
their
servants
full
of
mirth
and
joyous
cheer
there
having
rested
awhile
they
went
not
to
dinner
till
half
a
dozen
canzonets
each
merrier
than
other
had
been
carolled
by
the
young
men
and
the
ladies
then
water
being
given
to
their
hands
the
seneschal
seated
them
all
at
table
according
to
the
pleasure
and
the
viands
being
brought
they
all
ate
blithely
rising
thence
they
gave
themselves
awhile
to
dancing
and
and
after
by
the
queen
commandment
whoso
would
betook
himself
to
rest
but
presently
the
wonted
hour
being
come
all
in
the
accustomed
place
assembled
to
discourse
whereupon
the
queen
looking
at
filomena
bade
her
give
commencement
to
the
stories
of
that
day
and
she
smiling
began
on
this
wise

according
to
the
ptolemaic
system

been

no

we
should
speak

nothing

for
a

to

and
that
not
only
doth
love
bring
lovers
into
divers
dangers
of
death
but
causeth
them
even
to
enter
for
dead
into
the
of
the
dead
it
is
my
pleasure
to
relate
to
you
a
story
thereof
over
and
above
those
which
have
been
told
whereby
not
only
will
you
apprehend
the
puissance
of
love
but
will
know
the
wit
used
by
a
worthy
lady
in
ridding
herself
of
two
who
loved
her
against
her
will
you
must
know
then
that
there
was
once
in
the
city
of
pistoia
a
very
fair
widow
lady
of
whom
two
of
our
townsmen
called
the
one
rinuccio
palermini
and
the
other
alessandro
chiarmontesi
there
abiding
by
reason
of
banishment
from
florence
were
without
knowing
one
of
other
passionately
enamoured
having
by
chance
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
doing
privily
each
his
utmost
endeavour
to
win
her
favour
the
gentlewoman
in
question
whose
name
was
madam
francesca
de
lazzari
being
still
importuned
of
the
one
and
the
other
with
messages
and
entreaties
to
which
she
had
whiles
somewhat
unwisely
given
ear
and
desiring
but
in
vain
discreetly
to
retract
bethought
herself
how
she
might
avail
to
rid
herself
of
their
importunity
by
requiring
them
of
a
service
which
albeit
it
was
possible
she
conceived
that
neither
of
them
would
render
her
to
the
intent
that
they
not
doing
that
which
she
required
she
might
have
a
fair
and
colourable
occasion
of
refusing
to
hearken
more
to
their
messages
and
the
device
which
occurred
to
her
was
on
this
wise
there
had
died
that
very
day
at
pistoia
one
who
albeit
his
ancestors
were
gentlemen
was
reputed
the
worst
man
that
was
not
only
in
pistoia
but
in
all
the
world
more
by
token
that
he
was
in
his
lifetime
so
misshapen
and
of
so
monstrous
a
favour
that
whoso
knew
him
not
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
had
been
affeared
of
him
and
he
had
been
buried
in
a
tomb
without
the
church
of
the
minor
friars
this
circumstance
she
bethought
herself
would
in
part
be
very
apt
to
her
purpose
and
accordingly
she
said
to
a
maid
of
hers
knowest
the
annoy
and
the
vexation
i
suffer
all
day
long
by
the
messages
of
yonder
two
florentines
rinuccio
and
alessandro
now
i
am
not
disposed
to
gratify
either
of
them
with
my
love
and
to
rid
myself
of
them
i
have
bethought
myself
for
the
great
proffers
that
they
make
to
seek
to
make
proof
of
them
in
somewhat
which
i
am
certain
they
will
not
do
so
shall
i
do
away
from
me
this
their
importunity
and
thou
shalt
see
how
thou
knowest
that
scannadio
for
so
was
the
wicked
man
called
of
whom
we
have
already
spoken
this
morning
buried
in
the
of
the
minor
brethren
scannadio
of
whom
whenas
they
saw
him
alive
let
alone
dead
the
doughtiest
men
of
this
city
went
in
fear
wherefore
go
thou
privily
first
to
alessandro
and
bespeak
him
saying
madam
francesca
giveth
thee
to
know
that
now
is
the
time
come
whenas
thou
mayst
have
her
love
which
thou
hast
so
much
desired
and
be
with
her
an
thou
wilt
on
this
wise
this
night
for
a
reason
which
thou
shalt
know
after
the
body
of
scannadio
who
was
this
morning
buried
is
to
be
brought
to
her
house
by
a
kinsman
of
hers
and
she
being
in
great
fear
of
him
dead
though
he
be
would
fain
not
have
him
there
wherefore
she
prayeth
thee
that
it
please
thee
by
way
of
doing
her
a
great
service
go
this
evening
at
the
time
of
the
first
sleep
to
the
tomb
wherein
he
is
buried
and
donning
the
dead
man
clothes
abide
as
thou
wert
he
until
such
time
as
they
shall
come
for
thee
then
without
moving
or
speaking
thou
must
suffer
thyself
be
taken
up
out
of
the
tomb
and
carried
to
her
house
where
she
will
receive
thee
and
thou
mayst
after
abide
with
her
and
depart
at
thy
leisure
leaving
to
her
the
care
of
the
rest
an
he
say
that
he
will
do
it
well
and
good
but
should
he
refuse
bid
him
on
my
part
never
more
show
himself
whereas
i
may
be
and
look
as
he
valueth
his
life
that
he
send
me
no
more
letters
or
messages
then
shalt
thou
betake
thee
to
rinuccio
palermini
and
say
to
him
madam
francesca
saith
that
she
is
ready
to
do
thine
every
pleasure
an
thou
wilt
render
her
a
great
service
to
wit
that
towards
the
middle
hour
thou
get
thee
to
the
tomb
wherein
scannadio
was
this
morning
buried
and
take
him
up
softly
thence
and
bring
him
to
her
at
her
house
without
saying
a
word
of
aught
thou
mayst
hear
or
feel
there
shalt
thou
learn
what
she
would
with
him
and
have
of
her
thy
pleasure
but
an
it
please
thee
not
to
do
this
she
chargeth
thee
never
more
send
her
writ
nor
message
footnote
signifies
and
was
no
doubt
a
nickname
bestowed
upon
the
dead
man
on
account
of
his
wicked
and
reprobate
way
of
life
the
maid
betook
herself
to
the
two
lovers
and
did
her
errand
punctually
to
each
saying
as
it
had
been
enjoined
her
whereto
each
made
answer
that
an
it
pleased
her
they
would
go
not
only
into
a
tomb
but
into
hell
itself
the
maid
carried
their
reply
to
the
lady
and
she
waited
to
see
if
they
would
be
mad
enough
to
do
it
the
night
come
whenas
it
was
the
season
of
the
first
sleep
alessandro
chiarmontesi
having
stripped
himself
to
his
doublet
went
forth
of
his
house
to
take
scannadio
place
in
the
tomb
but
by
the
way
there
came
a
very
frightful
thought
into
his
head
and
he
fell
in
himself
lack
what
a
fool
i
am
whither
go
i
how
know
i
but
yonder
woman
kinsfolk
having
maybe
perceived
that
i
love
her
and
believing
that
which
is
not
have
caused
me
do
this
so
they
may
slaughter
me
in
yonder
tomb
an
it
should
happen
thus
i
should
suffer
for
it
nor
would
aught
in
the
world
be
ever
known
thereof
to
their
detriment
or
what
know
i
but
maybe
some
enemy
of
mine
hath
procured
me
this
whom
she
belike
loveth
and
seeketh
to
oblige
therein
then
said
he
grant
that
neither
of
these
things
be
and
that
her
kinsfolk
are
for
carrying
me
to
her
house
i
must
believe
that
they
want
not
scannadio
body
to
hold
it
in
their
arms
or
to
put
it
in
hers
nay
it
is
rather
to
be
conceived
that
they
mean
to
do
it
some
mischief
as
the
body
of
one
who
maybe
disobliged
them
in
somewhat
aforetime
she
saith
that
i
am
not
to
say
a
word
for
aught
that
i
may
feel
but
should
they
put
out
mine
eyes
or
draw
my
teeth
or
lop
off
my
hands
or
play
me
any
other
such
trick
how
shall
i
do
how
could
i
abide
quiet
and
if
i
speak
they
will
know
me
and
mayhap
do
me
a
mischief
or
though
they
do
me
no
hurt
yet
shall
i
have
accomplished
nothing
for
that
they
will
not
leave
me
with
the
lady
whereupon
she
will
say
that
i
have
broken
her
commandment
and
will
never
do
aught
to
pleasure
me
so
saying
he
had
well
nigh
returned
home
but
nevertheless
his
great
love
urged
him
on
with
counter
arguments
of
such
potency
that
they
brought
him
to
the
tomb
which
he
opened
and
entering
therein
stripped
scannadio
of
his
clothes
then
donning
them
and
shutting
the
tomb
upon
himself
he
laid
himself
in
the
dead
man
place
thereupon
he
began
to
call
to
mind
what
manner
of
man
the
latter
had
been
and
remembering
him
of
all
the
things
whereof
he
had
aforetime
heard
tell
as
having
befallen
by
night
not
to
say
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
dead
but
even
otherwhere
his
every
hair
began
to
stand
on
end
and
himseemed
each
moment
as
if
scannadio
should
rise
upright
and
butcher
him
then
and
there
however
aided
by
his
ardent
love
he
got
the
better
of
these
and
the
other
fearful
thoughts
that
beset
him
and
abiding
as
he
were
the
dead
man
he
fell
to
awaiting
that
which
should
betide
him
meanwhile
rinuccio
midnight
being
now
at
hand
departed
his
house
to
do
that
which
had
been
enjoined
him
of
his
mistress
and
as
he
went
he
entered
into
many
and
various
thoughts
of
the
things
which
might
possibly
betide
him
as
to
wit
that
he
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
police
with
scannadio
body
on
his
shoulders
and
be
doomed
to
the
fire
as
a
sorcerer
and
that
he
should
an
the
thing
came
to
be
known
incur
the
of
his
kinsfolk
and
other
like
thoughts
whereby
he
was
like
to
have
been
deterred
but
after
bethinking
himself
again
quoth
he
i
deny
this
gentlewoman
whom
i
have
so
loved
and
love
the
first
thing
she
requireth
of
me
especially
as
i
am
thereby
to
gain
her
favour
god
forbid
though
i
were
certainly
to
die
thereof
but
i
should
set
myself
to
do
that
which
i
have
promised
accordingly
he
went
on
and
presently
coming
to
the
sepulchre
opened
it
easily
which
alessandro
hearing
abode
still
albeit
he
was
in
great
fear
rinuccio
entering
in
and
thinking
to
take
scannadio
body
laid
hold
of
feet
and
drew
him
forth
of
the
tomb
then
hoisting
him
on
his
shoulders
he
made
off
towards
the
lady
house
going
thus
and
taking
no
manner
of
heed
to
his
burden
he
jolted
it
many
a
time
now
against
one
corner
and
now
another
of
certain
benches
that
were
beside
the
way
more
by
token
that
the
night
was
so
cloudy
and
so
dark
he
could
not
see
whither
he
went
he
was
already
well
nigh
at
the
door
of
the
gentlewoman
who
had
posted
herself
at
the
window
with
her
maid
to
see
if
he
would
bring
alessandro
and
was
ready
armed
with
an
excuse
to
send
them
both
away
when
it
chanced
that
the
officers
of
the
watch
who
were
ambushed
in
the
street
and
abode
silently
on
the
watch
to
lay
hands
upon
a
certain
outlaw
hearing
the
scuffling
that
rinuccio
made
with
his
feet
suddenly
put
out
a
light
to
see
what
was
to
do
and
whither
to
go
and
rattled
their
targets
and
halberds
crying
goeth
there
rinuccio
seeing
this
and
having
scant
time
for
deliberation
let
fall
his
burden
and
made
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
whereupon
alessandro
arose
in
haste
and
made
off
in
his
turn
for
all
he
was
hampered
with
the
dead
clothes
which
were
very
long
the
lady
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
put
out
by
the
police
had
plainly
recognized
rinuccio
with
alessandro
on
his
shoulders
and
perceiving
the
latter
to
be
clad
in
scannadio
clothes
marvelled
amain
at
the
exceeding
hardihood
of
both
but
for
all
her
wonderment
she
laughed
heartily
to
see
alessandro
cast
down
on
the
ground
and
to
see
him
after
take
to
flight
then
rejoiced
at
this
accident
and
praising
god
that
he
had
rid
her
of
the
annoy
of
these
twain
she
turned
back
into
the
house
and
betook
herself
to
her
chamber
avouching
to
her
maid
that
without
doubt
they
both
loved
her
greatly
since
as
it
appeared
they
had
done
that
which
she
had
enjoined
them
meanwhile
rinuccio
woeful
and
cursing
his
ill
fortune
for
all
that
returned
not
home
but
as
soon
as
the
watch
had
departed
the
neighbourhood
he
came
back
whereas
he
had
dropped
alessandro
and
groped
about
to
see
if
he
could
find
him
again
so
he
might
make
an
end
of
his
service
but
finding
him
not
and
concluding
that
the
police
had
carried
him
off
he
returned
to
his
own
house
woebegone
whilst
alessandro
unknowing
what

concluded
that

nevertheless
each
of

signified
to
the

that

curt
response
to
the
effect
that

an
abbess
arising
in
haste
and
in
the
dark
to
find
one
of
her
nuns
who
had
been
denounced
to
her
in
bed
with
her
lover
and
thinking
to
cover
her
head
with
her
coif

the

of

which

accused

observing
and
making

is

hath

lover

now
silent
and
the
lady
address
in
ridding
herself
of
those
whom
she
chose
not
to
love
having
been
commended
of
all
whilst
on
the
other
hand
the
presumptuous
hardihood
of
the
two
gallants
was
held
of
them
to
be
not
love
but
madness
the
queen
said
gaily
to
elisa
elisa
follow
on
accordingly
she
promptly
began
adroitly
indeed
dearest
ladies
did
madam
francesca
contrive
to
rid
herself
of
her
annoy
as
hath
been
told
but
a
young
nun
fortune
aiding
her
delivered
herself
with
an
apt
speech
from
an
imminent
peril
as
you
know
there
be
many
very
dull
folk
who
set
up
for
teachers
and
censors
of
others
but
whom
as
you
may
apprehend
from
my
story
fortune
bytimes
deservedly
putteth
to
shame
as
befell
the
abbess
under
whose
governance
was
the
nun
of
whom
i
have
to
tell
you
must
know
then
that
there
was
once
in
lombardy
a
convent
very
famous
for
sanctity
and
religion
wherein
amongst
the
other
nuns
who
were
there
was
a
young
lady
of
noble
birth
and
gifted
with
marvellous
beauty
who
was
called
isabetta
and
who
coming
one
day
to
the
grate
to
speak
with
a
kinsman
of
hers
fell
in
love
with
a
handsome
young
man
who
accompanied
him
the
latter
seeing
her
very
fair
and
divining
her
wishes
with
his
eyes
became
on
like
wise
enamoured
of
her
and
this
love
they
suffered
a
great
while
without
fruit
to
the
no
small
unease
of
each
at
last
each
being
solicited
by
a
like
desire
the
young
man
hit
upon
a
means
of
coming
at
his
nun
in
all
secrecy
and
she
consenting
thereto
he
visited
her
not
once
but
many
times
to
the
great
contentment
of
both
but
this
continuing
it
chanced
one
night
that
he
was
without
the
knowledge
of
himself
or
his
mistress
seen
of
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
convent
to
take
leave
of
isabetta
and
go
his
ways
the
nun
communicated
her
discovery
to
divers
others
and
they
were
minded
at
first
to
denounce
isabetta
to
the
abbess
who
was
called
madam
usimbalda
and
who
in
the
opinion
of
the
nuns
and
of
whosoever
knew
her
was
a
good
and
pious
lady
but
on
consideration
they
bethought
themselves
to
seek
to
have
the
abbess
take
her
with
the
young
man
so
there
might
be
no
room
for
denial
accordingly
they
held
their
peace
and
kept
watch
by
turns
in
secret
to
surprise
her
now
it
chanced
that
isabetta
suspecting
nothing
of
this
nor
being
on
her
guard
caused
her
lover
come
thither
one
night
which
was
forthright
known
to
those
who
were
on
the
watch
for
this
and
who
whenas
it
seemed
to
them
time
a
good
part
of
the
night
being
spent
divided
themselves
into
two
parties
whereof
one
abode
on
guard
at
the
door
of
her
cell
whilst
the
other
ran
to
the
abbess
chamber
and
knocking
at
the
door
till
she
answered
said
to
her
madam
arise
quickly
for
we
have
discovered
that
isabetta
hath
a
young
man
in
her
cell
now
the
abbess
was
that
night
in
company
with
a
priest
whom
she
ofttimes
let
come
to
her
in
a
chest
but
hearing
the
outcry
and
fearing
lest
of
their
overhaste
and
eagerness
they
should
push
open
the
door
she
hurriedly
arose
and
dressed
herself
as
best
she
might
in
the
dark
thinking
to
take
certain
plaited
veils
which
nuns
wear
on
their
heads
and
call
a
psalter
she
caught
up
by
chance
the
priest
breeches
and
such
was
her
haste
that
without
remarking
what
she
did
she
threw
them
over
her
head
in
lieu
of
the
psalter
and
going
forth
hurriedly
locked
the
door
after
her
saying
is
this
accursed
one
of
god
then
in
company
with
the
others
who
were
so
ardent
and
so
intent
upon
having
isabetta
taken
in
default
that
they
noted
not
that
which
the
abbess
had
on
her
head
she
came
to
the
and
breaking
it
open
with
the
aid
of
the
others
entered
and
found
the
two
lovers
abed
in
each
other
arms
who
all
confounded
at
such
a
surprise
abode
fast
unknowing
what
to
do
the
young
lady
was
incontinent
seized
by
the
other
nuns
and
haled
off
by
command
of
the
abbess
to
the
whilst
her
gallant
dressed
himself
and
abode
await
to
see
what
should
be
the
issue
of
the
adventure
resolved
if
any
hurt
were
offered
to
his
mistress
to
do
a
mischief
to
as
many
nuns
as
he
could
come
at
and
carry
her
off
the
abbess
sitting
in
chapter
proceeded
in
the
presence
of
all
the
nuns
who
had
no
eyes
but
for
the
culprit
to
give
the
latter
the
foulest
rating
that
ever
woman
had
as
having
by
her
lewd
and
filthy
practices
an
the
thing
should
come
to
be
known
without
the
walls
sullied
the
sanctity
the
honour
and
the
fair
fame
of
the
convent
and
to
this
she
added
very
grievous
menaces
the
young
lady
shamefast
and
fearful
as
feeling
herself
guilty
knew
not
what
to
answer
and
keeping
silence
possessed
the
other
nuns
with
compassion
for
her
however
after
a
while
the
abbess
multiplying
words
she
chanced
to
raise
her
eyes
and
espied
that
which
the
former
had
on
her
head
and
the
that
hung
down
therefrom
on
either
side
whereupon
guessing
how
the
matter
stood
she
was
all
reassured
and
said
god
aid
you
tie
up
your
coif
and
after
say
what
you
will
to
me
the
abbess
taking
not
her
meaning
answered
coif
vile
woman
that
thou
art
hast
thou
the
face
to
bandy
pleasantries
at
such
a
time
thinkest
thou
this
that
thou
hast
done
is
a
jesting
matter
madam
answered
isabetta
up
your
coif
and
after
say
what
you
will
to
me
thereupon
many
of
the
nuns
raised
their
eyes
to
the
abbess
head
and
she
also
putting
her
hand
thereto
perceived
as
did
the
others
why
isabetta
spoke
thus
wherefore
the
abbess
becoming
aware
of
her
own
default
and
perceiving
that
it
was
seen
of
all
past
hope
of
recoverance
changed
her
note
and
proceeding
to
speak
after
a
fashion
altogether
different
from
her
beginning
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
impossible
to
withstand
the
pricks
of
the
flesh
wherefore
she
said
that
each
should
whenas
she
might
privily
give
herself
a
good
time
even
as
it
had
been
done
until
that
day
accordingly
setting
the
young
lady
free
she
went
back
to
sleep
with
her
priest
and
isabetta
returned
to
her
lover
whom
many
a
time
thereafter
she
let
come
thither
in
despite
of
those
who
envied
her
whilst
those
of
the
others
who
were
loverless
pushed
their
fortunes
in
secret
as
best
they
knew
the
third
story
day
the
ninth
master
simone
at
the
instance
of
bruno
and
buffalmacco
and
nello
maketh
calandrino
believe
that
he
is
with
child
wherefore
he
giveth
them
capons
and
money
for
medicines
and
recovereth
without
bringing
forth
after
elisa
had
finished
her
story
and
all
the
ladies
had
returned
thanks
to
god
who
had
with
a
happy
issue
delivered
the
young
nun
from
the
claws
of
her
envious
companions
the
queen
bade
filostrato
follow
on
and
he
without
awaiting
further
commandment
began
fairest
ladies
the
unmannerly
lout
of
a
marchegan
judge
of
whom
i
told
you
yesterday
took
out
of
my
mouth
a
story
of
calandrino
and
his
companions
which
i
was
about
to
relate
and
for
that
albeit
it
hath
been
much
discoursed
of
him
and
them
aught
that
is
told
of
him
can
not
do
otherwise
than
add
to
our
merriment
i
will
tell
you
that
which
i
had
then
in
mind
it
hath
already
been
clearly
enough
shown
who
calandrino
was
and
who
were
the
others
of
whom
i
am
to
speak
in
this
story
wherefore
without
further
preface
i
shall
tell
you
that
an
aunt
of
his
chanced
to
die
and
left
him
two
hundred
crowns
in
small
coin
whereupon
he
fell
of
wishing
to
buy
an
estate
and
entered
into
treaty
with
all
the
brokers
in
florence
as
if
he
had
ten
thousand
gold
florins
to
expend
but
the
matter
still
fell
through
when
they
came
to
the
price
of
the
estate
in
question
bruno
and
buffalmacco
knowing
all
this
had
told
him
once
and
again
that
he
were
better
spend
the
money
in
making
merry
together
with
them
than
go
buy
land
as
if
he
had
had
to
make
pellets
but
far
from
this
they
had
never
even
availed
to
bring
him
to
give
them
once
to
eat
one
day
as
they
were
complaining
of
this
there
came
up
a
comrade
of
theirs
a
painter
by
name
nello
and
they
all
three
took
counsel
together
how
they
might
find
a
means
of
greasing
their
gullets
at
calandrino
expense
wherefore
without
more
delay
having
agreed
among
themselves
of
that
which
was
to
do
they
watched
next
morning
for
his
coming
forth
of
his
house
nor
had
he
gone
far
when
nello
accosted
him
saying
calandrino
calandrino
answered
god
give
him
good
day
and
good
year
and
nello
halting
awhile
fell
to
looking
him
in
the
face
whereupon
calandrino
asked
him
what
lookest
thou
quoth
the
painter
aught
ailed
thee
this
night
meseemeth
thou
are
not
thyself
this
morning
calandrino
incontinent
began
to
quake
and
said
how
so
what
deemest
thou
aileth
me
answered
nello
for
that
i
ca
say
but
thou
seemest
to
me
all
changed
belike
it
is
nothing
so
saying
he
let
him
pass
and
calandrino
fared
on
all
misdoubtful
albeit
he
felt
no
whit
ailing
but
buffalmacco
who
was
not
far
off
seeing
him
quit
of
nello
made
for
him
and
saluting
him
enquired
if
aught
ailed
him
quoth
calandrino
know
not
nay
nello
told
me
but
now
that
i
seemed
to
him
all
changed
can
it
be
that
aught
aileth
me
rejoined
buffalmacco
must
be
something
or
other
amiss
with
thee
for
thou
appearest
half
dead
footnote
balls
for
a
pellet
bow
usually
made
out
of
clay
bruno
and
buffalmacco
were
punning
upon
the
double
meaning
land
and
earth
or
clay
of
the
word
by
this
time
it
seemed
to
calandrino
that
he
had
the
fevers
when
lo
up
came
bruno
and
the
first
thing
he
said
was
what
manner
of
face
is
this
calandrino
hearing
them
all
in
the
same
tale
held
it
for
certain
that
he
was
in
an
ill
way
and
asked
them
all
aghast
shall
i
do
quoth
bruno
thou
wert
best
return
home
and
get
thee
to
bed
and
cover
thyself
well
and
send
thy
water
to
master
simone
the
doctor
who
is
as
thou
knowest
as
our
very
creature
and
will
tell
thee
incontinent
what
thou
must
do
we
will
go
with
thee
and
if
it
behoveth
to
do
aught
we
will
do
it
accordingly
nello
having
joined
himself
to
them
they
returned
home
with
calandrino
who
betook
himself
all
dejected
into
the
bedchamber
and
said
to
his
wife
cover
me
well
for
i
feel
myself
sore
disordered
then
laying
himself
down
he
despatched
his
water
by
a
little
maid
to
master
simone
who
then
kept
shop
in
the
old
market
at
the
sign
of
the
pumpkin
whilst
bruno
said
to
his
comrades
you
here
with
him
whilst
i
go
hear
what
the
doctor
saith
and
bring
him
hither
if
need
be
for
god
sake
comrade
mine
cried
calandrino
thither
and
bring
me
back
word
how
the
case
standeth
for
i
feel
i
know
not
what
within
me
accordingly
bruno
posted
off
to
master
simone
and
coming
thither
before
the
girl
who
brought
the
water
acquainted
him
with
the
case
wherefore
the
maid
being
come
and
the
physician
having
seen
the
water
he
said
to
her
and
bid
calandrino
keep
himself
well
warm
and
i
will
come
to
him
incontinent
and
tell
him
that
which
aileth
him
and
what
he
must
do
the
maid
reported
this
to
her
master
nor
was
it
long
before
the
physician
and
bruno
came
whereupon
the
former
seating
himself
beside
calandrino
fell
to
feeling
his
pulse
and
presently
the
patient
wife
being
there
present
he
said
calandrino
to
speak
to
thee
as
a
friend
there
aileth
thee
nought
but
that
thou
art
with
child
when
calandrino
heard
this
he
fell
for
dolour
and
said
me
tessa
this
is
thy
doing
for
that
thou
wilt
still
be
uppermost
i
told
thee
how
it
would
be
the
lady
who
was
a
very
modest
person
hearing
her
husband
speak
thus
blushed
all
red
for
shamefastness
and
hanging
her
head
went
out
of
the
room
without
answering
a
word
whilst
calandrino
pursuing
his
complaint
said
wretch
that
i
am
how
shall
i
do
how
shall
i
bring
forth
this
child
whence
shall
he
issue
i
see
plainly
i
am
a
dead
man
through
the
mad
lust
of
yonder
wife
of
mine
whom
god
make
as
woeful
as
i
would
fain
be
glad
were
i
as
well
as
i
am
not
i
would
arise
and
deal
her
so
many
and
such
buffets
that
i
would
break
every
bone
in
her
body
albeit
it
serveth
me
right
for
that
i
should
never
have
suffered
her
get
the
upper
hand
but
for
certain
an
i
come
off
alive
this
time
she
may
die
of
desire
ere
she
do
it
again
bruno
and
buffalmacco
and
nello
were
like
to
burst
with
laughter
hearing
calandrino
words
however
they
contained
themselves
but
doctor
laughed
so
immoderately
that
you
might
have
drawn
every
tooth
in
his
head
finally
calandrino
commending
himself
to
the
physician
and
praying
him
give
him
aid
and
counsel
in
this
his
strait
the
latter
said
to
him
i
will
not
have
thee
lose
heart
for
praised
be
god
we
have
taken
the
case
so
betimes
that
in
a
few
days
and
with
a
little
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
thereof
but
it
will
cost
thee
some
little
expense
doctor
mine
cried
calandrino
for
the
love
of
god
do
it
i
have
here
two
hundred
crowns
wherewith
i
was
minded
to
buy
me
an
estate
take
them
all
if
need
be
so
i
be
not
brought
to
bed
for
i
know
not
how
i
should
do
seeing
i
hear
women
make
such
a
terrible
outcry
whereas
they
are
about
to
bear
child
for
all
they
have
ample
commodity
therefor
that
methinketh
if
i
had
that
pain
to
suffer
i
should
die
ere
i
came
to
the
bringing
forth
quoth
the
doctor
no
fear
of
that
i
will
let
make
thee
a
certain
ptisan
of
distilled
waters
very
good

this
hath
right

in

his

caused

somewhat
of

which

me
to
relate
to
you
there
were
then
in
siena
not
many
years
ago
two
as
far
as
age
went
men
each
of
whom
was
called
cecco
one
was
the
son
of
messer
angiolieri
and
the
other
of
messer
fortarrigo
and
albeit
in
most
other
things
they
sorted
ill
of
fashions
one
with
the
other
they
were
natheless
so
far
of
accord
in
one
particular
to
wit
that
they
were
both
hated
of
their
fathers
that
they
were
by
reason
thereof
grown
friends
and
companied
often
together
after
awhile
angiolieri
who
was
both
a
handsome
man
and
a
himseeming
he
could
ill
live
at
siena
of
the
provision
assigned
him
of
his
father
and
hearing
that
a
certain
cardinal
a
great
patron
of
his
was
come
into
the
marches
of
ancona
as
the
pope
legate
determined
to
betake
himself
to
him
thinking
thus
to
better
his
condition
accordingly
acquainting
his
father
with
his
purpose
he
took
order
with
him
to
have
at
once
that
which
he
was
to
give
him
in
six
months
so
he
might
clothe
and
horse
himself
and
make
an
honourable
figure
as
he
went
seeking
some
one
whom
he
might
carry
with
him
for
his
service
the
thing
came
to
fortarrigo
knowledge
whereupon
he
presently
repaired
to
angiolieri
and
besought
him
as
best
he
knew
to
carry
him
with
him
offering
himself
to
be
to
him
lackey
and
and
all
without
any
wage
beyond
his
expenses
paid
angiolieri
answered
that
he
would
nowise
take
him
not
but
he
knew
him
to
be
right
well
sufficient
unto
every
manner
of
service
but
for
that
he
was
a
gambler
and
bytimes
a
drunkard
to
boot
but
the
other
replied
that
he
would
without
fail
keep
himself
from
both
of
these
defaults
and
affirmed
it
unto
him
with
oaths
galore
adding
so
many
prayers
that
angiolieri
was
prevailed
upon
and
said
that
he
was
content
accordingly
they
both
set
out
one
morning
and
went
to
dine
at
buonconvento
where
after
dinner
the
heat
being
great
angiolieri
let
make
ready
a
bed
at
the
inn
and
undressing
himself
with
fortarrigo
aid
went
to
sleep
charging
the
latter
call
him
at
the
stroke
of
none
as
soon
as
his
master
was
asleep
fortarrigo
betook
himself
to
the
tavern
and
there
after
drinking
awhile
he
fell
to
gaming
with
certain
men
who
in
a
trice
won
of
him
some
money
he
had
and
after
the
very
clothes
he
had
on
his
back
whereupon
desirous
of
retrieving
himself
he
repaired
in
his
shirt
as
he
was
to
angiolieri
chamber
and
seeing
him
fast
asleep
took
from
his
purse
what
monies
he
had
and
returning
to
play
lost
these
as
he
had
lost
the
others
presently
angiolieri
awoke
and
arising
dressed
himself
and
enquired
for
fortarrigo
the
latter
was
not
to
be
found
and
angiolieri
concluding
him
to
be
asleep
drunken
somewhere
as
was
bytimes
his
wont
determined
to
leave
him
be
and
get
himself
another
servant
at
corsignano
accordingly
he
caused
put
his
saddle
and
his
valise
on
a
palfrey
he
had
and
thinking
to
pay
the
reckoning
so
he
might
get
him
gone
found
himself
without
a
penny
whereupon
great
was
the
outcry
and
all
the
hostelry
was
in
an
uproar
angiolieri
declaring
that
he
had
been
robbed
there
and
threatening
to
have
the
host
and
all
his
household
carried
prisoners
to
siena
at
this
moment
up
came
fortarrigo
in
his
shirt
thinking
to
take
his
master
clothes
as
he
had
taken
his
money
and
seeing
the
latter
ready
to
mount
said
is
this
angiolieri
must
we
needs
be
gone
already
good
lack
wait
awhile
there
will
be
one
here
forthwith
who
hath
my
doublet
in
pawn
for
shillings
and
i
am
certain
that
he
will
render
it
up
for
money
down
as
he
spoke
there
came
one
who
certified
angiolieri
that
it
was
fortarrigo
who
had
robbed
him
of
his
monies
by
showing
him
the
sum
of
those
which
the
latter
had
lost
at
play
wherefore
he
was
sore
incensed
and
loaded
fortarrigo
with
reproaches
and
had
he
not
feared
others
more
than
he
feared
god
he
had
done
him
a
mischief
then
threatening
to
have
him
strung
up
by
the
neck
or
outlawed
from
siena
he
mounted
to
horse
fortarrigo

if
he
spoke
not
to
him

this

may
have
it
again
for
shillings

if
we
tarry

till
he
will
not
take
less
than
the
he
lent
me
thereon

this
favour
he

three
shillings

the

angiolieri
hearing
him
talk
thus
lost
all
patience
more
by
token
that
he
saw
himself
eyed
askance
by
the
bystanders
who
manifestly
believed
not
that
fortarrigo
had
gamed
away
his
monies
but
that
he
had
yet
monies
of
fortarrigo
in
hand
and
said
to
him
have

to
do
with
thy

mayst
thou
be

up

not

thou

fortarrigo
still
stood
to
it

said

this

should

yonder
fellow
have
it
for

forty

thou

angiolieri
beyond
measure
exasperated
to
see
himself
first
robbed
and
now
held
in
parley
after
this
fashion
made
him
no
further
answer
but
turning
his
palfrey
head
took
the
road
to
torrenieri
whilst
fortarrigo
bethinking
himself
of
a
subtle
piece
of
knavery
proceeded
to
trot
after
him
in
his
shirt
good
two
miles
still
requiring
him
of
his
doublet
presently
angiolieri
pricking
on

his

annoy
fortarrigo
espied
some
husbandmen
in
a
field
adjoining
the
highway
in
advance
of
him
and
cried
out
to
them
saying
him
stop
him
accordingly
they
ran
up
some
with
spades
and
others
with
mattocks
and
presenting
themselves
in
the
road
before
angiolieri
concluding
that
he
had
robbed
him
who
came
crying
after
him
in
his

stopped
and
took
him
it
availed
him
little
to
tell
them
who
he
was
and
how
the
case
stood

fortarrigo
coming
up

with
an
angry
air

told
them
his
own

but
his
words
were
not

fortarrigo
with
the
aid
of
the
countrymen
pulled
him
off
his
palfrey
and
stripping
him
clad
himself
in

then
mounting
to

he
left

mounted

aforesaid
niccolo
cornacchini
was
a
townsman
of
ours
and
a
rich
man
and
had
among
his
other
possessions
a
fine
estate
at
camerata
whereon
he
let
build
a
magnificent
mansion
and
agreed
with
bruno
and
buffalmacco
to
paint
it
all
for
him
and
they
for
that
the
work
was
great
joined
to
themselves
nello
and
calandrino
and
fell
to
work
thither
for
that
there
was
none
of
the
family
in
the
house
although
there
were
one
or
two
chambers
furnished
with
beds
and
other
things
needful
and
an
old
abode
there
as
guardian
of
the
place
a
son
of
the
said
niccolo
by
name
filippo
being
young
and
without
a
wife
was
wont
bytimes
to
bring
some
wench
or
other
for
his
diversion
and
keep
her
there
a
day
or
two
and
after
send
her
away
it
chanced
once
among
other
times
that
he
brought
thither
one
called
niccolosa
whom
a
lewd
fellow
by
name
mangione
kept
at
his
disposal
in
a
house
at
camaldoli
and
let
out
on
hire
she
was
a
woman
of
a
fine
person
and
well
clad
and
for
her
kind
well
enough
mannered
and
spoken
one
day
at
noontide
she
having
come
forth
her
chamber
in
a
white
petticoat
with
her
hair
twisted
about
her
head
and
being
in
act
to
wash
her
hands
and
face
at
a
well
that
was
in
the
courtyard
of
the
mansion
it
chanced
that
calandrino
came
thither
for
water
and
saluted
her
familiarly
she
returned
him
his
greeting
and
fell
to
eying
him
more
because
he
seemed
to
her
an
odd
sort
of
fellow
than
for
any
fancy
she
had
for
him
whereupon
he
likewise
fell
her
and
himseeming
she
was
handsome
he
began
to
find
his
occasions
for
abiding
there
and
returned
not
to
his
comrades
with
the
water
but
knowing
her
not
dared
not
say
aught
to
her
she
who
had
noted
his
looking
glanced
at
him
from
time
to
time
to
make
game
of
him
heaving
some
small
matter
of
sighs
the
while
wherefore
calandrino
fell
suddenly
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
and
left
not
the
courtyard
till
she
was
recalled
by
filippo
into
the
chamber
therewithal
he
returned
to
work
but
did
nought
but
sigh
which
bruno

had
still
an
eye
to

for
that
he

he
dost
nought
but
sigh
answered
calandrino
i
but
some
one
to
help
me
i
should
fare
well
so
enquired
bruno
and
calandrino
replied
must
not
be
told
to
any
but
there
is
a
lass
down
yonder
fairer
than
a
fairy
who
hath
fallen
so
mightily
in
love
with
me
that
seem
to
thee
a
grave
matter
i
noted
it
but
now
whenas
i
went
for
the
water
cried
bruno
she
be
not
filippo
wife
quoth
calandrino
it
is
she
for
that
he
called
her
and
she
went
to
him
in
the
chamber
but
what
of
that
in
matters
of
this
kind
i
would
jockey
christ
himself
let
alone
filippo
and
to
tell
thee
the
truth
comrade
she
pleaseth
me
more
than
i
can
tell
thee
answered
bruno
will
spy
thee
out
who
she
is
and
if
she
be
filippo
wife
i
will
order
thine
affairs
for
thee
in
a
brace
of
words
for
she
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
but
how
shall
we
do
so
buffalmacco
may
not
know
i
can
never
get
a
word
with
her
but
he
is
with
me
quoth
calandrino
buffalmacco
i
reck
not
but
we
must
beware
of
nello
for
that
he
is
tessa
kinsman
and
would
mar
us
everything
and
bruno
said
now
he
knew
very
well
who
the
wench
was
for
that
he
had
seen
her
come
and
moreover
filippo
had
told
him
accordingly
calandrino
having
left
work
awhile
and
gone
to
get
a
sight
of
her
bruno
told
nello
and
buffalmacco
everything
and
they
took
order
together
in
secret
what
they
should
do
with
him
in
the
matter
of
this
his
enamourment
when
he
came
back
bruno
said
to
him
softly
seen
her
yes
replied
calandrino
hath
slain
me
quoth
bruno
must
go
see
an
it
be
she
i
suppose
and
if
it
be
so
leave
me
do
accordingly
he
went
down
into
the
courtyard
and
finding
filippo
and
niccolosa
there
told
them
precisely
what
manner
of
man
calandrino
was
and
took
order
with
them
of
that
which
each
of
them
should
do
and
say
so
they
might
divert
themselves
with
the
lovesick
gull
and
make
merry
over
his
passion
then
returning
to
calandrino
he
said
is
indeed
she
wherefore
needs
must
the
thing
be
very
discreetly
managed
for
should
filippo
get
wind
of
it
all
the
water
in
the
arno
would
not
wash
us
but
what
wouldst
thou
have
me
say
to
her
on
thy
part
if
i
should
chance
to
get
speech
of
her
answered
calandrino
shalt
tell
her
to
begin
with
that
i
will
her
a
thousand
measures
of
that
good
stuff
that
getteth
with
child
and
after
that
i
am
her
servant
and
if
she
would
have
aught
thou
takest
me
said
bruno
me
do
presently
being
come
the
painters
left
work
and
went
down
into
the
courtyard
where
they
found
filippo
and
niccolosa
and
tarried
there
awhile
to
oblige
calandrino
the
latter
fell
to
ogling
niccolosa
and
making
the
oddest
grimaces
in
the
world
such
and
so
many
that
a
blind
man
would
have
remarked
them
she
on
her
side
did
everything
that
she
thought
apt
to
inflame
him
and
filippo
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
he
had
of
bruno
made
believe
to
talk
with
buffalmacco
and
the
others
and
to
have
no
heed
of
this
whilst
taking
the
utmost
diversion
in
calandrino
fashions
however
after
a
while
to
the
latter
exceeding
chagrin
they
took
their
leave
and
as
they
returned
to
florence
bruno
said
to
calandrino
can
tell
thee
thou
makest
her
melt
like
ice
in
the
sun
cock
body
wert
thou
to
fetch
thy
rebeck
and
warble
thereto
some
of
those
amorous
ditties
of
thine
thou
wouldst
cause
her
cast
herself
out
of
window
to
come
to
thee
quoth
calandrino
thou
gossip
deemest
thou
i
should
do
well
to
fetch
it
do
i
answered
bruno
and
calandrino
went
on
wouldst
not
credit
me
this
morning
whenas
i
told
it
thee
but
for
certain
gossip
methinketh
i
know
better
than
any
man
alive
to
do
what
i
will
who
other
than
i
had
known
to
make
such
a
lady
so
quickly
in
love
with
me
not
your
trumpeting
young
braggarts
i
warrant
you
who
are
up
and
down
all
day
long
and
could
not
make
shift
in
a
thousand
years
to
get
together
three
handsful
of
cherry
stones
i
would
fain
have
thee
see
me
with
the
rebeck
be
fine
sport
for
thee
i
will
have
thee
to
understand
once
for
all
that
i
am
no
dotard
as
thou
deemest
me
and
this
she
hath
right
well
perceived
she
but
i
will
make
her
feel
it
othergates
fashion
so
once
i
get
my
claw
into
her
back
by
the
very
body
of
christ
i
will
lead
her
such
a
dance
that
she
will
run
after
me
as
the
madwoman
after
her
child
rejoined
bruno
warrant
me
thou
wilt
rummage
her
methinketh
i
see
thee
with
those
teeth
of
thine
that
were
made
for
virginal
jacks
bite
that
little
vermeil
mouth
of
hers
and
those
her
cheeks
that
show
like
two
roses
and
after
eat
her
all
up
footnote
di
tromba
the
sense
seems
as
above
the
commentators
say
that
di
tromba
is
a
name
given
to
those
youths
who
go
trumpeting
about
everywhere
the
favours
accorded
them
by
women
but
the
is
a
not
a
wind
a
sort
of
primitive
violoncello
with
one
string
footnote
your
teeth
did
dance
like
virginal
jacks
calandrino
hearing
this
fancied
himself
already
at
it
and
went
singing
and
skipping
so
overjoyed
that
he
was
like
to
jump
out
of
his
skin
on
the
morrow
having
brought
the
rebeck
he
to
the
great
diversion
of
all
the
company
sang
sundry
songs
thereto
and
in
brief
he
was
taken
with
such
an
itch
for
the
frequent
seeing
of
her
that
he
wrought
not
a
whit
but
ran
a
thousand
times
a
day
now
to
the
window
now
to
the
door
and
anon
into
the
courtyard
to
get
a
look
at
her
whereof
she
adroitly
carrying
out
bruno
instructions
afforded
him
ample
occasion
bruno
on
his
side
answered
his
messages
in
her
name
and
bytimes
brought
him
others
as
from
her
and
whenas
she
was
not
there
which
was
mostly
the
case
he
carried
him
letters
from
her
wherein
she
gave
him
great
hopes
of
compassing
his
desire
feigning
herself
at
home
with
her
kinsfolk
where
he
might
not
presently
see
her
on
this
wise
bruno
with
the
aid
of
buffalmacco
who
had
a
hand
in
the
matter
kept
the
game
afoot
and
had
the
greatest
sport
in
the
world
with
calandrino
antics
causing
him
give
them
bytimes
as
at
his
mistress
request
now
an
ivory
comb
now
a
purse
and
anon
a
knife
and
such
like
toys
for
which
they
brought
him
in
return
divers
paltry
counterfeit
rings
of
no
value
with
which
he
was
vastly
delighted
and
to
boot
they
had
of
him
for
their
pains
store
of
dainty
collations
and
other
small
matters
of
entertainment
so
they
might
be
diligent
about
his
affairs
on
this
wise
they
kept
him
in
play
good
two
months
without
getting
a
step
farther
at
the
end
of
which
time
seeing
the
work
draw
to
an
end
and
bethinking
himself
that
an
he
brought
not
his
amours
to
an
issue
in
the
meantime
he
might
never
have
another
chance
thereof
he
began
to
urge
and
importune
bruno
amain
wherefore
when
next
the
girl
came
to
the
mansion
bruno
having
first
taken
order
with
her
and
filippo
of
what
was
to
be
done
said
to
calandrino
gossip
yonder
lady
hath
promised
me
a
good
thousand
times
to
do
that
which
thou
wouldst
have
and
yet
doth
nought
thereof
and
meseemeth
she
leadeth
thee
by
the
nose
wherefore
since
she
doth
it
not
as
she
promiseth
we
will
an
it
like
thee
make
her
do
it
will
she
nill
she
ay
answered
calandrino
the
love
of
god
let
it
be
done
speedily
quoth
bruno
thy
heart
serve
thee
to
touch
her
with
a
script
i
shall
give
thee
sure
replied
calandrino
and
the
other
do
thou
make
shift
to
bring
me
a
piece
of
virgin
parchment
and
a
live
bat
together
with
three
grains
of
frankincense
and
a
candle
that
hath
been
blessed
by
the
priest
and
leave
me
do
accordingly
calandrino
lay
in
wait
all
the
next
night
with
his
engines
to
catch
a
bat
and
having
at
last
taken
one
carried
it
to
bruno
with
the
other
things
required
whereupon
the
latter
withdrawing
to
a
chamber
scribbled
divers
toys
of
his
fashion
upon
the
parchment
in
characters
of
his
own
devising
and
brought
it
to
him
saying
calandrino
that
if
thou
touch
her
with
this
script
she
will
incontinent
follow
thee
and
do
what
thou
wilt
wherefore
if
filippo
should
go
abroad
anywhither
do
thou
contrive
to
accost
her
on
some
pretext
or
other
and
touch
her
then
betake
thyself
to
the
barn
yonder
which
is
the
best
place
here
for
thy
purpose
for
that
no
one
ever
frequenteth
there
thou
wilt
find
she
will
come
thither
and
when
she
is
there
thou
knowest
well
what
thou
hast
to
do
calandrino
was
the
joyfullest
man
alive
and
took
the
script
saying
leave
me
do
now
nello
whom
calandrino
mistrusted
had
as
much
diversion
of
the
matter
as
the
others
and
bore
a
hand
with
them
in
making
sport
of
him
wherefore
of
accord
with
bruno
he
betook
himself
to
florence
to
calandrino
wife
and
said
to
her
thou
knowest
what
a
beating
calandrino
gave
thee
without
cause
the
day
he
came
back
laden
with
stones
from
the
mugnone
wherefore
i
mean
to
have
thee
avenge
thyself
on
him
and
if
thou
do
it
not
hold
me
no
more
for
kinsman
or
for
friend
he
hath
fallen
in
love
with
a
woman
over
yonder
and
she
is
lewd
enough
to
go
very
often
closeting
herself
with
him
a
little
while
agone
they
appointed
each
other
to
foregather
together
this
very
day
wherefore
i
would
have
thee
come
thither
and
lie
in
wait
for
him
and
chastise
him
well
when
the
lady
heard
this
it
seemed
to
her
no
jesting
matter
but
starting
to
her
feet
she
fell
common
thief
that
thou
art
is
it
thus
that
thou
usest
me
by
christ
his
cross
it
shall
not
pass
thus
but
i
will
pay
thee
therefor
then
taking
her
mantle
and
a
little
maid
to
bear
her
company
she
started
off
at
a
good
round
pace
for
the
mansion
together
with
nello
as
soon
as
bruno
saw
the
latter
afar
off
he
said
to
filippo
cometh
our
friend
whereupon
the
latter
betaking
himself
whereas
calandrino
and
the
others
were
at
work
said
needs
must
i
go
presently
to
florence
work
with
a
will
then
going
away
he
hid
himself
in
a
place
when
he
could
without
being
seen
see
what
calandrino
should
do
the
latter
as
soon
as
he
deemed
filippo
somewhat
removed
came
down
into
the
courtyard
and
finding
niccolosa
there
alone
entered
into
talk
with
her
whilst
she
who
knew
well
enough
what
she
had
to
do
drew
near
him
and
entreated
him
somewhat
more
familiarly
than
of
wont
thereupon
he
touched
her
with
the
script
and
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
he
turned
without
saying
a
word
and
made
for
the
barn
whither
she
followed
him
as
soon
as
she
was
within
she
shut
the
door
and
taking
him
in
her
arms
threw
him
down
on
the
straw
that
was
on
the
floor
then
mounting
astride
of
him
and
holding
him
with
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
without
letting
him
draw
near
her
face
she
gazed
at
him
as
he
were
her
utmost
desire
and
said
sweet
my
calandrino
heart
of
my
body
my
soul
my
treasure
my
comfort
how
long
have
i
desired
to
have
thee
and
to
be
able
to
hold
thee
at
my
wish
thou
hast
drawn
all
the
thread
out
of
my
shift
with
thy
gentilesse
thou
hast
tickled
my
heart
with
thy
rebeck
can
it
be
true
that
i
hold
thee
calandrino
who
could
scarce
stir
said
god
sake
sweet
my
soul
let
me
buss
thee
answered
she
art
in
a
mighty
hurry
let
me
first
take
my
fill
of
looking
upon
thee
let
me
sate
mine
eyes
with
that
sweet
face
of
thine
now
bruno
and
buffalmacco
were
come
to
join
filippo
and
all
three
heard
and
saw
all
this
as
calandrino
was
now
offering
to
kiss
niccolosa
perforce
up
came
nello
with
dame
tessa
and
said
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
place
vow
to
god
they
are
together
then
coming
up
to
the
door
of
the
barn
the
lady
who
was
all
with
rage
dealt
it
such
a
push
with
her
hands
that
she
sent
it
flying
and
entering
saw
niccolosa
astride
of
calandrino
the
former
seeing
the
lady
started
up
in
haste
and
taking
to
flight
made
off
to
join
filippo
whilst
dame
tessa
fell
tooth
and
nail
upon
calandrino
who
was
still
on
his
back
and
clawed
all
his
face
then
clutching
him
by
the
hair
and
haling
him
hither
and
thither
sorry
shitten
cur
quoth
she
thou
then
use
me
thus
besotted
dotard
that
thou
art
accursed

the
weal
i
have
willed
thee

thee

enough
to
do

to
be
squeezed

there
would
not
come
as
much
juice
from
thee
as
might
suffice
for
a
sauce
faith
thou
canst
not
say
it
was
tessa
that
was
presently
in
act
to
get
thee
with
child
god
make
her
sorry
who
ever
she
is
for
a
scurvy
trull
as
she
must
be
to
have
a
mind
to
so
fine
a
jewel
as
thou
calandrino
seeing
his
wife
come
abode
neither
dead
nor
alive
and
had
not
the
hardihood
to
make
any
defence
against
her
but
rising
all
scratched
and
flayed
and
baffled
as
he
was
and
picking
up
his
bonnet
he
fell
to
humbly
beseeching
her
leave
crying
out
an
she
would
not
have
him
cut
in
pieces
for
that
she
who
had
been
with
him
was
the
wife
of
the
master
of
the
house
whereupon
quoth
she
be
it
god
give
her
an
ill
year
at
this
moment
bruno
and
buffalmacco
having
laughed
their
fill
at
all
this
in
company
with
filippo
and
niccolosa
came
up
feigning
to
be
attracted
by
the
clamour
and
having
with
no
little
ado
appeased
the
lady
counselled
calandrino
betake
himself
to
florence
and
return
thither
no
more
lest
filippo
should
get
wind
of
the
matter
and
do
him
a
mischief
accordingly
he
returned
to
florence
chapfallen
and
woebegone
all
flayed
and
scratched
and
never
ventured
to
go
thither
again
but
being
plagued
and
harassed
night
and
day
with
his
wife
reproaches
he
made
an
end
of
his
fervent
love
having
given
much
cause
for
laughter
to
his
companions
no
less
than
to
niccolosa
and
filippo
the
sixth
story
day
the
ninth
two
young
gentlemen
lodge
the
night
with
an
innkeeper
whereof
one
goeth
to
lie
with
the
host

whilst
his
wife
unwittingly
coucheth
with
the
other
after
which
he
who
lay
with
the
girl
getteth
him
to
bed
with
her
father
and
telleth
him

thinking
to
bespeak
his
comrade
therewithal
they
come
to
words
but
the
wife
perceiving
her
mistake
entereth
her
daughter
bed
and
thence
with
certain
words
appeaseth
everything
calandrino
who
had
otherwhiles
afforded
the
company
matter
for
laughter
made
them
laugh
this
time
also
and
whenas
the
ladies
had
left
devising
of
his
fashions
the
queen
bade
pamfilo
tell
whereupon
quoth
he
laudable
ladies
the
name
of
niccolosa
mistress
hath
brought
me
back
to
mind
a
story
of
another
niccolosa
which
it
pleaseth
me
to
tell
you
for
that
therein
you
shall
see
how
a
goodwife
ready
wit
did
away
a
great
scandal
in
the
plain
of
mugnone
there
was
not
long
since
a
good
man
who
gave
wayfarers
to
eat
and
drink
for
their
money
and
although
he
was
poor
and
had
but
a
small
house
he
bytimes
at
a
pinch
gave
not
every
one
but
sundry
acquaintances
a
night
lodging
he
had
a
wife
a
very
handsome
woman
by
whom
he
had
two
children
whereof
one
was
a
fine
buxom
lass
of
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
who
was
not
yet
married
and
the
other
a
little
child
not
yet
a
year
old
whom
his
mother
herself
suckled
now
a
young
gentleman
of
our
city
a
sprightly
and
pleasant
youth
who
was
often
in
those
parts
had
cast
his
eyes
on
the
girl
and
loved
her
ardently
and
she
who
gloried
greatly
in
being
beloved
of
a
youth
of
his
quality
whilst
studying
with
pleasing
fashions
to
maintain
him
in
her
love
became
no
less
enamoured
of
him
and
more
than
once
by
mutual
accord
this
their
love
had
had
the
desired
effect
but
that
pinuccio
for
such
was
the
young
man
name
feared
to
bring
reproach
upon
his
mistress
and
himself
however
his
ardour
waxing
from
day
to
day
he
could
no
longer
master
his
desire
to
foregather
with
her
and
bethought
himself
to
find
a
means
of
harbouring
with
her
father
doubting
not
from
his
acquaintance
with
the
ordinance
of
the
latter
house
but
he
might
in
that
event
contrive
to
pass
the
night
in
her
company
without
any
being
the
wiser
and
no
sooner
had
he
conceived
this
design
than
he
proceeded
without
delay
to
carry
it
into
execution
accordingly
in
company
with
a
trusty
friend
of
his
called
adriano
who
knew
his
love
he
late
one
evening
hired
a
couple
of
hackneys
and
set
thereon
two
pairs
of
filled
belike
with
straw
with
which
they
set
out
from
florence
and
fetching
a
compass
rode
till
they
came
overagainst
the
plain
of
mugnone
it
being
by
this
night
then
turning
about
as
they
were
on
their
way
back
from
romagna
they
made
for
the
good
man
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
the
host
being
very
familiar
with
both
of
them
promptly
opened
the
door
and
pinuccio
said
to
him
you
thou
must
needs
harbour
us
this
night
we
thought
to
reach
florence
before
dark
but
have
not
availed
to
make
such
haste
but
that
we
find
ourselves
here
as
thou
seest
at
this
hour
answered
the
host
well
knowest
how
little
commodity
i
have
to
lodge
such
men
as
you
are
however
since
the
night
hath
overtaken
you
here
and
there
is
no
time
for
you
to
go
otherwhere
i
will
gladly
harbour
you
as
i
may
the
two
young
men
accordingly
alighted
and
entered
the
inn
where
they
first
eased
their
hackneys
and
after
supper
with
the
host
having
taken
good
care
to
bring
provision
with
them
footnote
unsaddled
and
stabled
and
fed
them
now
the
good
man
had
but
one
very
small
bedchamber
wherein
were
three
set
as
best
he
knew
two
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
the
third
overagainst
them
at
the
other
end
nor
for
all
that
was
there
so
much
space
left
that
one
could
go
there
otherwise
than
straitly
the
least
ill
of
the
three
the
host
let
make
ready
for
the
two
friends
and
put
them
to
lie
there
then
after
a
while
neither
of
the
gentlemen
being
asleep
though
both
made
a
show
thereof
he
caused
his
daughter
betake
herself
to
bed
in
one
of
the
two
others
and
lay
down
himself
in
the
third
with
his
wife
who
set
by
the
bedside
the
cradle
wherein
she
had
her
little
son
things
being
ordered
after
this
fashion
and
pinuccio
having
seen
everything
after
a
while
himseeming
that
every
one
was
asleep
he
arose
softly
and
going
to
the
bed
where
slept
the
girl
beloved
of
him
laid
himself
beside
the
latter
by
whom
for
all
she
did
it
timorously
he
was
joyfully
received
and
with
her
he
proceeded
to
take
of
that
pleasure
which
both
most
desired
whilst
pinuccio
abode
thus
with
his
mistress
it
chanced
that
a
cat
caused
certain
things
fall
which
the
good
wife
awaking
heard
whereupon
fearing
lest
it
were
otherwhat
she
arose
as
she
was
in
the
dark
and
betook
herself
whereas
she
had
heard
the
noise
meanwhile
adriano
without
intent
aforethought
arose
by
chance
for
some
natural
occasion
and
going
to
despatch
this
came
upon
the
cradle
whereas
it
had
been
set
by
the
good
wife
and
unable
to
pass
without
moving
it
took
it
up
and
set
it
down
beside
his
own
bed
then
having
accomplished
that
for
which
he
had
arisen
he
returned
and
betook
himself
to
bed
again
without
recking
of
the
cradle
the
good
wife
having
searched
and
found
the
thing
which
had
fallen
was
not
what
she
thought
never
troubled
herself
to
kindle
a
light
to
see
it
but
chiding
the
cat
returned
to
the
chamber
and
groped
her
way
to
the
bed
where
her
husband
lay
finding
the
cradle
not
there
o
me
quoth
she
in
herself
what
i
was
about
to
do
as
i
am
a
christian
i
had
well
nigh
gone
straight
to
our
guest
bed
then
going
a
little
farther
and
finding
the
cradle
she
entered
the
bed
whereby
it
stood
and
laid
herself
down
beside
adriano
thinking
to
couch
with
her
husband
adriano
who
was
not
yet
asleep
feeling
this
received
her
well
and
joyously
and
laying
her
aboard
in
a
trice
clapped
on
all
sail
to
the
no
small
contentment
of
the
lady
meanwhile
pinuccio
fearing
lest
sleep
should
surprise
him
with
his
lass
and
having
taken
of
her
his
fill
of
pleasure
arose
from
her
to
return
to
his
own
bed
to
sleep
and
finding
the
cradle
in
his
way
took
the
adjoining
bed
for
that
of
his
host
wherefore
going
a
little
farther
he
lay
down
with
the
latter
who
awoke
at
his
coming
pinuccio
deeming
himself
beside
adriano
said
tell
thee
there
never
was
so
sweet
a
creature
as
is
niccolosa
cock
body
i
have
had
with
her
the
rarest
sport
ever
man
had
with
woman
more
by
token
that
i
have
gone
upwards
of
six
times
into
the
country
since
i
left
thee
the
host
hearing
this
talk
and
being
not
overwell
pleased
therewith
said
first
in
himself
a
devil
doth
this
fellow
here
then
more
angered
than
quoth
he
hath
been
a
great
piece
of
villainy
of
thine
and
i
know
not
why
thou
shouldst
have
used
me
thus
but
by
the
body
of
god
i
will
pay
thee
for
it
pinuccio
who
was
not
the
wisest
lad
in
the
world
seeing
his
mistake
addressed
not
himself
to
mend
it
as
best
he
might
but
said
what
wilt
thou
pay
me
what
canst
thou
do
to
me
therewithal
the
hostess
who
thought
herself
with
her
husband
said
to
adriano
lack
hark
to
our
guests
how
they
are
at
i
know
not
what
words
together
quoth
adriano
laughing
them
do
god
land
them
in
an
ill
year
they
drank
overmuch
yesternight
the
good
wife
herseeming
she
had
heard
her
husband
scold
and
hearing
adriano
speak
incontinent
perceived
where
and
with
whom
she
had
been
whereupon
like
a
wise
woman
as
she
was
she
arose
forthright
without
saying
a
word
and
taking
her
little
son
cradle
carried
it
at
a
guess
for
that
there
was
no
jot
of
light
to
be
seen
in
the
chamber
to
the
side
of
the
bed
where
her
daughter
slept
and
lay
down
with
the
latter
then
as
if
she
had
been
aroused
by
her
husband
clamour
she
called
him
and
enquired
what
was
to
do
between
himself
and
pinuccio
he
answered
thou
not
what
he
saith
he
hath
done
this
night
unto
niccolosa
quoth
she
lieth
in
his
throat
for
he
was
never
abed
with
niccolosa
seeing
that
i
have
lain
here
all
night
more
by
token
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
sleep
a
wink
and
thou
art
an
ass
to
believe
him
you
men
drink
so
much
of
an
evening
that
you
do
nothing
but
dream
all
night
and
fare
hither
and
thither
without
knowing
it
and
fancy
you
do
wonders
is
a
thousand
pities
you
break
your
necks
but
what
doth
pinuccio
yonder
why
bideth
he
not
in
his
own
bed
adriano
on
his
part
seeing
how
adroitly
the
good
wife
went
about
to
cover
her
own
shame
and
that
of
her
daughter
chimed
in
with
i
have
told
thee
an
hundred
times
not
to
go
abroad
for
that
this
thy
trick
of
arising
in
thy
sleep
and
telling
for
true
the
extravagances
thou
dreamest
will
bring
thee
into
trouble
some
day
or
other
come
back
here
god
give
thee
an
ill
night
the
host
hearing
what
his
wife
and
adriano
said
began
to
believe
in
good
earnest
that
pinuccio
was
dreaming
and
accordingly
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
he
fell
to
shaking
and
calling
him
saying
awake
return
to
thine
own
bed
pinuccio
having
apprehended
all
that
had
been
said
began
to
wander
off
into
other
extravagances
after
the
fashion
of
a
man
whereat
the
host
set
up
the
heartiest
laughter
in
the
world
at
last
he
made
believe
to
awake
for
stress
of
shaking
and
calling
to
adriano
said
it
already
day
that
thou
callest
me
answered
the
other
hither
accordingly
pinuccio
dissembling
and
making
a
show
of
being
arose
at
last
from
beside
the
host
and
went
back
to
bed
with
adriano
the
day
come
and
they
being
risen
the
host
fell
to
laughing
and
mocking
at
pinuccio
and
his
dreams
and
so
they
passed
from
one
jest
to
another
till
the
young
men
having
saddled
their
rounceys
and
strapped
on
their
valises
and
drunken
with
the
host
remounted
to
horse
and
rode
away
to
florence
no
less
content
with
the
manner
in
which
the
thing
had
betided
than
with
the
effect
itself
thereof
thereafter
pinuccio
found
other
means
of
foregathering
with
niccolosa
who
vowed
to
her
mother
that
he
had
certainly
dreamt
the
thing
wherefore
the
goodwife
remembering
her
of
embracements
inwardly
avouched
herself
alone
to
have
waked
the
seventh
story
day
the
ninth
talano
di
molese
dreameth
that
a
wolf
mangleth
all
his
wife
neck
and
face
and
biddeth
her
beware
thereof
but
she
payeth
no
heed
to
his
warning
and
it
befalleth
her
even
as
he
had
dreamed
pamfilo
story
being
ended
and
the
goodwife
presence
of
mind
having
been
commended
of
all
the
queen
bade
pampinea
tell
hers
and
she
thereupon
began
it
hath
been
otherwhile
discoursed
among
us
charming
ladies
of
the
truths
foreshown
by
dreams
the
which
many
of
our
sex
scoff
at
wherefore
notwithstanding
that
which
hath
been
said
thereof
i
shall
not
scruple
to
tell
you
in
a
very
few
words
that
which
no
great
while
ago
befell
a
of
mine
for
not
giving
credit
to
a
dream
of
herself
seen
by
her
husband
i
know
not
if
you
were
acquainted
with
talano
di
molese
a
very
worshipful
man
who
took
to
wife
a
young
lady
called
margarita
fair
over
all
others
but
so
humoursome
and
froward
that
she
would
do
nought
of
other
folk
judgment
nor
could
others
do
aught
to
her
liking
the
which
irksome
as
it
was
to
talano
to
endure
natheless
as
he
could
no
otherwise
needs
must
he
put
up
with
it
chanced
one
night
that
being
with
this
margarita
of
his
at
an
estate
he
had
in
the
country
himseemed
in
his
sleep
he
saw
his
wife
go
walking
in
a
very
fair
wood
which
they
had
not
far
from
their
house
and
as
she
went
himseemed
there
came
forth
of
a
thicket
a
great
and
fierce
wolf
which
sprang
straight
at
her
throat
and
pulling
her
to
the
ground
enforced
himself
to
carry
her
off
whilst
she
screamed
for
aid
and
after
she
winning
free
of
his
fangs
it
seemed
he
had
marred
all
her
throat
and
face
accordingly
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
he
said
to
the
lady
albeit
thy
frowardness
hath
never
suffered
me
to
have
a
good
day
with
thee
yet
it
would
grieve
me
should
ill
betide
thee
wherefore
an
thou
wilt
hearken
to
my
counsel
thou
wilt
not
go
forth
the
house
and
being
asked
of
her
why
he
orderly
recounted
to
her
his
dream
the
lady
shook
her
head
and
said
willeth
thee
ill
dreameth
thee
thou
feignest
thyself
mighty
careful
of
me
but
thou
dreamest
of
me
that
which
thou
wouldst
fain
see
come
to
pass
and
thou
mayst
be
assured
that
i
will
be
careful
both
and
always
not
to
gladden
thee
with
this
or
other
mischance
of
mine
quoth
talano
knew
thou
wouldst
say
thus
for
that
such
thanks
still
hath
he
who
combeth
a
but
believe
as
thou
listeth
i
for
my
part
tell
it
to
thee
for
good
and
once
more
i
counsel
thee
abide
at
home
or
at
least
beware
of
going
into
our
wood
answered
the
lady
will
do
it
and
after
fell
to
herself
thou
how
artfully
yonder
man
thinketh
to
have
feared
me
from
going
to
our
wood
doubtless
he
hath
given
some
trull
or
other
tryst
there
and
would
not
have
me
find
him
with
her
marry
it
were
fine
eating
for
him
with
blind
folk
and
i
should
be
a
right
simpleton
an
i
saw
not
his
drift
and
if
i
believed
him
but
certes
he
shall
not
have
his
will
nay
though
i
abide
there
all
day
needs
must
i
see
what
traffic
is
this
that
he
hath
in
hand
accordingly
her
husband
being
gone
out
at
one
door
she
went
out
at
the
other
and
betook
herself
as
most
secretly
she
might
straight
to
the
wood
and
hid
herself
in
the
thickest
part
thereof
standing
attent
and
looking
now
here
and
now
there
an
she
should
see
any
one
come
as
she
abode
on
this
wise
without
any
thought
of
danger
behold
there
sallied
forth
of
a
thick
coppice
hard
by
a
terrible
great
wolf
and
scarce
could
she
say
aid
me
when
it
flew
at
her
throat
and
laying
fast
hold
of
her
proceeded
to
carry
her
off
as
she
were
a
lambkin
she
could
neither
cry
nor
aid
herself
on
other
wise
so
sore
was
her
gullet
straitened
wherefore
the
wolf
carrying
her
off
would
assuredly
have
throttled
her
had
he
not
encountered
certain
shepherds
who
shouted
at
him
and
constrained
him
to
loose
her
the
shepherds
knew
her
and
carried
her
home
in
a
piteous
plight
where
after
long
tending
by
the
physicians
she
was
healed
yet
not
so
wholly
but
she
had
all
her
throat
and
a
part
of
her
face
marred
on
such
wise
that
whereas
before
she
was
fair
she
ever
after
appeared
misfeatured
and
very
foul
of
favour
wherefore
being
ashamed
to
appear
whereas
she
might
be
seen
she
many
a
time
bitterly
repented
her
of
her
frowardness
and
her
perverse
denial
to
put
faith
in
a
matter
which
cost
her
nothing
in
her
husband
true

the
eighth
story

the
ninth
biondello
cheateth
ciacco
of
a
dinner
whereof
the
other
craftily
avengeth
himself
procuring
him
to
be
shamefully
beaten
the
merry
company
with
one
accord
avouched
that
which
talano
had
seen
in
sleep
to
have
been
no
dream
but
a
vision
so
punctually
without
there
failing
aught
thereof
had
it
come
to
pass
but
all
being
silent
the

as
those
most
discreet
ladies
who
have
foregone

moved
to

by
something

vengeance
wreaked
by
the
scholar

yesterday
moveth
me
to
tell
of
a
piece
of
revenge
which
without
being
so
barbarous
as
the
former
was
nevertheless
grievous
unto
him
who
brooked
it
i
must
tell
you
then
that
there
was
once
in
florence
a
man
whom
all
called
ciacco
as
great
a
glutton
as
ever
lived
his
means
sufficing
him
not
to
support
the
expense
that
his
gluttony
required
and
he
being
for
the
rest
a
very
man
and
full
of
goodly
and
pleasant
sayings
he
addressed
himself
to
be
not
altogether
a
buffoon
but
a
spunger
and
to
company
with
those
who
were
rich
and
delighted
to
eat
of
good
things
and
with
these
he
went
often
to
dine
and
sup
albeit
he
was
not
always
bidden
there
was
likewise
at
florence
in
those
days
a
man
called
biondello
a
little
dapper
fellow
of
his
person
very
quaint
of
his
dress
and
sprucer
than
a
fly
with
his
coif
on
his
head
and
his
yellow
periwig
still
drest
to
a
nicety
without
a
hair
awry
who
plied
the
same
trade
as
ciacco
going
one
morning
in
lent
whereas
they
sell
the
fish
and
cheapening
two
very
fine
lampreys
for
messer

he
was
seen
by
ciacco
who
accosted
him
and
said

this
whereto
biondello
made
answer
there
were
sent
unto
messer

three
lampreys
much
finer
than
these
and
a
sturgeon
to
which
sufficing
him
not
for
a
dinner
he
is
minded
to
give
certain
gentlemen
he
would
have
me
buy
these
other

lit
a

accordingly
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
he
betook
himself
to
messer
corso
house
where
he
found
him
with
sundry
neighbours
of
his
not
yet
gone
to
dinner
and
being
asked
of
him
what
he
went
doing
answered
i

come

with
you

your

quoth
messer

art
welcome
and
as
it
is
time
let

to

thereupon
they
seated
themselves
at
table
and
had
to
begin
with
chickpease
and
pickled
tunny
and
after
a
dish
of
fried
fish
from
the
arno
and
no

ciacco
perceiving
the
cheat
that
biondello
had
put

was
inwardly
no

angered
thereat
and
resolved
to
pay
him
for
it
nor
had
many
days
passed
ere
he
again
encountered
the

who
had
by
this
time
made
many
folk
merry
with
the
trick
he
had
played
him
biondello
seeing
him
saluted
him
and
asked
him
laughing
how
he
had
found
messer

lampreys
to
which
ciacco
answered
shalt
thou
know
much
better
than
i
ere
eight
days
be
past
then
without
wasting
time
over
the
matter
he
took
leave
of
biondello
and
agreeing
for
a
price
with
a
shrewd
huckster
carried
him
near
to
the
cavicciuoli
gallery
and
showing
him
a
gentleman
there
called
messer
filippo
argenti
a
big
burly
rawboned
fellow
and
the
most
despiteful
choleric
and
humoursome
man
alive
gave
him
a
great
glass
flagon
and
said
to
him
to
yonder
gentleman
with
this
flask
in
hand
and
say
to
him
sir
biondello
sendeth
me
to
you
and
prayeth
you
be
pleased
to
rubify
him
this
flask
with
your
good
red
wine
for
that
he
would
fain
make
merry
somedele
with

but
take
good

he
lay
not
his

on
thee
else
will
he
give
thee
an
ill
morrow
and
thou
wilt
have
marred
my
plans
i
aught
else
to
say
asked
the
huckster
and
ciacco
answered
do
but
go
and
say
this
and
after
come
back
to
me
here
with
the
flask
and
i
will
pay
thee
the
huckster
accordingly
set
off
and
did
his
errand
to
messer
filippo
who
hearing
the
message
and
being
lightly
ruffled
concluded
that
biondello
whom
he
knew
had
a
mind
to
make
mock
of
him
and
waxing
all
red
in
the
face
said
rubify
me
and
what
minions
be
these
god
land
thee
and
him
an
ill
year
then
starting
to
his
feet
he
put
out
his
hand
to
lay
hold
of
the
huckster
but
the
latter
who
was
on
his
guard
promptly
took
to
his
heels
and
returning
by
another
way
to
ciacco
who
had
seen
all
that
had
passed
told
him
what
messer
filippo
had
said
to
him
ciacco
well
pleased
paid
him
and
rested
not
till
he
found
biondello
to
whom
quoth
he
thou
been
late
at
the
cavicciuoli
gallery
answered
the
other
dost
thou
ask
me
replied
ciacco
must
tell
thee
that
messer
filippo
enquireth
for
thee
i
know
not
what
he
would
have
rejoined
biondello
am
going
that
way
and
will
speak
with
him
accordingly
he
made
off
and
ciacco
followed
him
to
see
how
the
thing
should
pass
meanwhile
messer
filippo
having
failed
to
come
at
the
huckster
abode
sore
disordered
and
was
inwardly
all
with
rage
being
unable
to
make
anything
in
the
world
of
the
huckster
words
if
not
that
biondello
at
whosesoever
instance
was
minded
to
make
mock
of
him
as
he
fretted
himself
thus
up
came
biondello
whom
no
sooner
did
he
espy
than
he
made
for
him
and
dealt
him
a
sore
buffet
in
the
face
sir
cried
biondello
is
this
whereupon
messer
filippo
clutching
him
by
the
hair
and
tearing
his
coif
cast
his
bonnet
to
the
ground
and
said
laying
on
to
him
amain
the
while
that
thou
art
thou
shalt
soon
see
what
it
is
what
is
this
thou
sendest
to
say
to
me
with
thy
rubify
me
and
thy
minions
deemest
thou
me
a
child
to
be
flouted
on
this
wise
so
saying
he
battered
his
whole
face
with
his
fists
which
were
like
very
iron
nor
left
him
a
hair
on
his
head
unruffled
then
rolling
him
in
the
mire
he
tore
all
the
clothes
off
his
back
and
to
this
he
applied
himself
with
such
a
will
that
biondello
could
not
avail
to
say
a
word
to
him
nor
ask
why
he
served
him
thus
he
had
heard
him
indeed
speak
of
me
and
but
knew
not
what
this
meant
at
last
messer
filippo
having
beaten
him
soundly
the
bystanders
whereof
many
had
by
this
time
gathered
about
them
dragged
him
with
the
utmost
difficulty
out
of
the
other
clutches
all
bruised
and
battered
as
he
was
and
told
him
why
the
gentleman
had
done
this
blaming
him
for
that
which
he
had
sent
to
say
to
him
and
telling
him
that
he
should
by
that
time
have
known
messer
filippo
better
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
jest
withal
biondello
all
in
tears
protested
his
innocence
declaring
that
he
had
never
sent
to
messer
filippo
for
wine
and
as
soon
as
he
was
somewhat
recovered
he
returned
home
sick
and
sorry
divining
that
this
must
have
been
ciacco
doing
when
after
many
days
the
bruises
being
gone
he
began
to
go
abroad
again
it
chanced
that
ciacco
encountered
him
and
asked
him
laughing
biondello
how
deemest

she
after
the

had
laughed
at
the
unlucky
biondello
began
blithely
to
speak
thus
lovesome
ladies
if
the
ordinance
of
created
things
be
considered
with
a
whole
mind
it
will
lightly
enough
be
seen
that
the
general
multitude
of
women
are
by
nature
by
custom
and
by
law
subjected
unto
men
and
that
it
behoveth
them
order
and
govern
themselves
according
to
the
discretion
of
these
latter
wherefore
each
woman
who
would
have
quiet
and
ease
and
solace
with
those
men
to
whom
she
pertaineth
should
be
humble
patient
and
obedient
besides
being
virtuous
which
latter
is
the
supreme
and
especial
treasure
of
every
wise
woman
nay
though
the
laws
which
in
all
things
regard
the
general
weal
and
usance
or
let
us
say
custom
whose
puissance
is
both
great
and
taught
us
not
this
nature
very
manifestly
showeth
it
unto
us
inasmuch
as
she
hath
made
us
women
tender
and
delicate
of
body
and
timid
and
fearful
of
spirit
and
hath
given
us
little
bodily
strength
sweet
voices
and
soft
and
graceful
movements
all
things
testifying
that
we
have
need
of
the
governance
of
others
now
those
who
have
need
to
be
helped
and
governed
all
reason
requireth
that
they
be
obedient
and
submissive
and
reverent
to
their
governors
and
whom
have
we
to
governors
and
helpers
if
not
men
to
men
therefore
it
behoveth
us
submit
ourselves
honouring
them
supremely
and
whoso
departeth
from
this
i
hold
her
deserving
not
only
of
grave
reprehension
but
of
severe
punishment
to
these
considerations
i
was
lead
though
not
for
the
first
time
by
that
which
pampinea
told
us
a
while
ago
of
froward
wife
upon
whom
god
sent
that
chastisement
which
her
husband
had
not
known
to
give
her
wherefore
as
i
have
already
said
all
those
women
who
depart
from
being
loving
compliant
and
amenable
as
nature
usance
and
law
will
it
are
in
my
judgment
worthy
of
stern
and
severe
chastisement
it
pleaseth
me
therefore
to
recount
to
you
a
counsel
given
by
solomon
as
a
salutary
medicine
for
curing
women
who
are
thus
made
of
that
malady
which
counsel
let
none
who
meriteth
not
such
treatment
repute
to
have
been
said
for
her
albeit
men
have
a
byword
which
saith
horse
and
bad
horse
both
the
spur
need
still
and
women
need
the
stick
both
good
and
which
words
an
one
seek
to
interpret
them
by
way
of
pleasantry
all
women
will
lightly
allow
to
be
true
nay
but
considering
them
morally
i
say
that
the
same
must
be
conceded
of
them
for
that
women
are
all
naturally
unstable
and
prone
to
frailty
wherefore
to
correct
the
iniquity
of
those
who
allow
themselves
too
far
to
overpass
the
limits
appointed
them
there
needeth
the
stick
which
punisheth
them
and
to
support
the
virtue
of
others
who
suffer
not
themselves
to
transgress
there
needeth
the
stick
which
sustaineth
and
affeareth
them

no

rode

with
a
young
man

held
the

is

he
entered
into
discourse
with
him
and
having
learned
from
him
what
and
whence
he
was
he
asked
him
whither
he
went
and
upon
what
occasion
to
which
giosefo
replied
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
solomon

have
counsel

what

he
should

he
in

after

for
some

they
came
to
a

over
which
was
a
fine

and
a

of
and
being
in

to

it
behoved

tarry
till

the

having

crossed
it

took
umbrage
as
oftentimes
we
see
them
do
and
would
by
no

a
muleteer
taking
a

began
to

it
at

moderately
enough
to
make
it
go
on

the
mule
shied
now
to
this
and
now
to
that
side
of
the
road
and
whiles
turned
back
altogether
but
would
on
no

incensed

to
dealing

on

stood
watching
this
and
said
often
to
the

wretch
that
thou
art

dost
thou
wilt
thou
kill
the
beast
why
studiest
thou
not

by

answered

i
know
my

leave
me

saying
he
fell
again
to
cudgelling
him
and
belaboured
him
to
such
purpose
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
that
the
mule
passed
on
and
the
muleteer
won
the
bout

a

sat
at

fared
on
and
came
after
some
days
to
antioch
where
giosefo
kept
melisso
with
him
that
he
might
rest
himself
a
day
or
two
and
being
scurvily
enough
received
of
his
wife
he
bade
her
prepare
supper
according
as
melisso
should
ordain
whereof
the
latter
seeing
that
it
was
his
friend
pleasure
acquitted
himself
in
a
few
words
the
lady
as
her
usance
had
been
in
the
past
did
not
as
melisso
had
ordained
but
well
nigh
altogether
the
contrary
which
giosefo
seeing
he
was
vexed
and
said
it
not
told
thee
on
what
wise
thou
shouldst
prepare
the
supper
the
lady
turning
round
haughtily
answered
meaneth
this
good
lack
why
dost
thou
not
sup
an
thou
have
a
mind
to
sup
an
if
it
were
told
me
otherwise
it
seemed
good
to
me
to
do
thus
if
it
please
thee
so
be
it
if
not
leave
it
be
melisso
marvelled
at
the
lady
answer
and
blamed
her
exceedingly
whilst
giosefo
hearing
this
said
thou
art
still
what
thou
wast
wont
to
be
but
trust
me
i
will
make
thee
change
thy
fashion
then
turning
to
melisso
said
he
shall
soon
see
what
manner
of
counsel
was
solomon
but
i
prithee
let
it
not
irk
thee
to
stand
to
see
it
and
hold
that
which
i
shall
do
for
a
sport
and
that
thou
mayest
not
hinder
me
bethink
thee
of
the
answer
the
muleteer
made
us
when
we
pitied
his
mule
quoth
melisso
am
in
thy
house
where
i
purpose
not
to
depart
from
thy
good
pleasure
giosefo
then
took
a
round
stick
made
of
a
young
oak
and
repaired
a
chamber
whither
the
lady
having
arisen
from
table
for
despite
had
betaken
herself
grumbling
then
laying
hold
of
her
by
the
hair
he
threw
her
down
at
his
feet
and
proceeded
to
give
her
a
sore
beating
with
the
stick
the
lady
at
first
cried
out
and
after
fell
to
threats
but
seeing
that
giosefo
for
all
that
stinted
not
and
being
by
this
time
all
bruised
she
began
to
cry
him
mercy
for
god
sake
and
besought
him
not
to
kill
her
declaring
that
she
would
never
more
depart
from
his
pleasure
nevertheless
he
held
not
his
hand
nay
he
continued
to
baste
her
more
furiously
than
ever
on
all
her
seams
belabouring
her
amain
now
on
the
ribs
now
on
the
haunches
and
now
about
the
shoulder
nor
stinted
till
he
was
weary
and
there
was
not
a
place
left
unbruised
on
the
good
lady
back
this
done
he
returned
to
his
friend
and
said
to
him
we
shall
see
what
will
be
the
issue
of
the
counsel
to
go
to
goosebridge
then
after
he
had
rested
awhile
and
they
had
washed
their
hands
he
supped
with
melisso
and
in
due
season
they
betook
themselves
to
bed
meanwhile
the
wretched
lady
arose
with
great
pain
from
the
ground
and
casting
herself
on
the
bed
there
rested
as
best
she
might
until
the
morning
when
she
arose
betimes
and
let
ask
giosefo
what
he
would
have
dressed
for
dinner
the
latter
making
merry
over
this
with
melisso
appointed
it
in
due
course
and
after
whenas
it
was
time
returning
they
found
everything
excellently
well
done
and
in
accordance
with
the
ordinance
given
wherefore
they
mightily
commended
the
counsel
at
first
so
ill
apprehended
of
them
after
some
days
melisso
took
leave
of
giosefo
and
returning
to
his
own
house
told
one
who
was
a
man
of
understanding
the
answer
he
had
had
from
solomon
whereupon
quoth
the
other
could
have
given
thee
no
truer
nor
better
counsel
thou
knowest
thou
lovest
no
one
and
the
honours
and
services
thou
renderest
others
thou
dost
not
for
love
that
thou
bearest
them
but
for
pomp
and
ostentation
love
then
as
solomon
bade
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
loved
on
this
wise
then
was
the
froward
wife
corrected
and
the
young
man
loving
was
beloved
the
tenth
story
day
the
ninth
dom
gianni
at
the
instance
of
his
gossip
pietro
performeth
a
conjuration
for
the
purpose
of
causing
the
latter
wife
to
become
a
mare
but
whenas
he
cometh
to
put
on
the
tail
pietro
marreth
the
whole
conjuration
saying
that
he
will
not
have
a
tail
the
queen
story
made
the
young
men
laugh
and
gave
rise
to
some
murmurs
on
the
part
of
the
ladies
then
as
soon
as
the
latter
were
quiet
dioneo
began
to
speak
thus
sprightly
ladies
a
black
crow
amongst
a
multitude
of
white
doves
addeth
more
beauty
than
would
a
swan
and
in
like
manner
among
many
sages
one
less
wise
is
not
only
an
augmentation
of
splendour
and
goodliness
to
their
maturity
but
eke
a
source
of
diversion
and
solace
wherefore
you
ladies
being
all
exceeding
discreet
and
modest
i
who
savour
somewhat
of
the
scatterbrain
should
be
dearer
to
you
causing
as
i
do
your
worth
to
shine
the
brightlier
for
my
default
than
if
with
my
greater
merit
i
made
this
of
yours
wax
dimmer
and
consequently
i
should
have
larger
license
to
show
you
myself
such
as
i
am
and
should
more
patiently
be
suffered
of
you
in
saying
that
which
i
shall
say
than
if
i
were
wiser
i
will
therefore
tell
you
a
story
not
overlong
whereby
you
may
apprehend
how
diligently
it
behoveth
to
observe
the
conditions
imposed
by
those
who
do
aught
by
means
of
enchantment
and
how
slight
a
default
thereof
sufficeth
to
mar
everything
done
by
the
magician
a
year
or
two
agone
there
was
at
barletta
a
priest
called
dom
gianni
di
barolo
who
for
that
he
had
but
a
poor
cure
took
to
eking
out
his
livelihood
by
hawking
merchandise
hither
and
thither
about
the
fairs
of
apulia
with
a
mare
of
his
and
buying
and
selling
in
the
course
of
his
travels
he
contracted
a
strait
friendship
with
one
who
styled
himself
pietro
da
tresanti
and
plied
the
same
trade
with
the
aid
of
an
ass
he
had
in
token
of
friendship
and
affection
he
called
him
still
gossip
pietro
after
the
apulian
fashion
and
whenassoever
he
visited
barletta
he
carried
him
to
his
parsonage
and
there
lodged
him
with
himself
and
entertained
him
to
the
best
of
his
power
gossip
pietro
on
his
part
albeit
he
was
very
poor
and
had
but
a
sorry
little
house
at
tresanti
scarce
sufficing
for
himself
and
a
young
and
buxom
wife
he
had
and
his
ass
as
often
as
dom
gianni
came
to
tresanti
carried
him
home
with
him
and
entertained
him
as
best
he
might
in
requital
of
the
hospitality
received
from
him
at
barletta
nevertheless
in
the
matter
of
lodging
having
but
one
sorry
little
bed
in
which
he
slept
with
his
handsome
wife
he
could
not
entertain
him
as
he
would
but
dom
gianni
mare
being
lodged
with
pietro
ass
in
a
little
stable
he
had
needs
must
the
priest
himself
lie
by
her
side
on
a
truss
of
straw
the
goodwife
knowing
the
hospitality
which
the
latter
did
her
husband
at
barletta
would
more
than
once
whenas
the
priest
came
thither
have
gone
to
lie
with
a
neighbor
of
hers
by
name
zita
caraprese
daughter
of
giudice
leo
so
he
might
sleep
in
the
bed
with
her
husband
and
had
many
a
time
proposed
it
to
dom
gianni
but
he
would
never
hear
of
it
and
once
amongst
other
times
he
said
to
her
gemmata
fret
not
thyself
for
me
i
fare
very
well
for
that
whenas
it
pleaseth
me
i
cause
this
mare
of
mine
become
a
handsome
wench
and
couch
with
her
and
after
when
i
will
i
change
her
into
a
mare
again
wherefore
i
care
not
to
part
from
her
the
young
woman
marvelled
but
believed
his
tale
and
told
her
husband
saying
he
is
so
much
thy
friend
as
thou
sayest
why
dost
thou
not
make
him
teach
thee
his
charm
so
thou
mayst
avail
to
make
of
me
a
mare
and
do
thine
affairs
with
the
ass
and
the
mare
so
should
we
gain
two
for
one
and
when
we
were
back
at
home
thou
couldst
make
me
a
woman
again
as
i
am
pietro
who
was
somewhat
dull
of
wit
believed
what
she
said
and
falling
in
with
her
counsel
began
as
best
he
knew
to
importune
dom
gianni
to
teach
him
the
trick
the
latter
did
his
best
to
cure
him
of
that
folly
but
availing
not
thereto
he
said
since
you
will
have
it
so
we
will
arise
morning
before
day
as
of
our
wont
and
i
will
show
you
how
it
is
done
to
tell
thee
the
truth
the
uneathest
part
of
the
matter
is
the
putting
on
of
the
tail
as
thou
shalt
see
accordingly
whenas
it
drew
near
unto
day
goodman
pietro
and
gossip
gemmata
who
had
scarce
slept
that
night
with
such
impatience
did
they
await
the
accomplishment
of
the
matter
arose
and
called
dom
gianni
who
arising
in
his
shirt
betook
himself
to
pietro
little
chamber
and
said
to
him
know
none
in
the
world
except
you
for
whom
i
would
do
this
wherefore
since
it
pleaseth
you
i
will
do
it
but
needs
must
you
do
as
i
shall
bid
you
an
you
would
have
the
thing
succeed
they
answered
that
they
would
do
that
which
he
should
say
whereupon
taking
the
light
he
put
it
into
pietro
hand
and
said
to
him
how
i
shall
do
and
keep
well
in
mind
that
which
i
shall
say
above
all
have
a
care
an
thou
wouldst
not
mar
everything
that
whatsoever
thou
hearest
or
seest
thou
say
not
a
single
word
and
pray
god
that
the
tail
may
stick
fast
pietro
took
the
light
promising
to
do
exactly
as
he
said
whereupon
dom
gianni
let
strip
gemmata
naked
as
she
was
born
and
caused
her
stand
on
all
fours
enjoining
herself
likewise
not
to
utter
a
word
for
aught
that
should
betide
then
passing
his
hand
over
her
face
and
her
head
he
proceeded
to
say
this
a
fine
mare
head
and
touching
her
hair
said
this
a
fine
mare
mane
after
which
he
touched
her
arms
saying
these
fine
mare
legs
and
feet
and
coming
presently
to
her
breast
and
finding
it
round
and
firm
such
an
one
awoke
that
was
not
called
and
started
up
on
end
whereupon
quoth
he
this
a
fine
mare
chest
and
on
like
wise
he
did
with
her
back
and
belly
and
crupper
and
thighs
and
legs
ultimately
nothing
remaining
to
do
but
the
tail
he
pulled
up
his
shirt
and
taking
the
dibble
with
which
he
planted
men
he
thrust
it
hastily
into
the
furrow
made
therefor
and
said
be
this
a
fine
mare
tail

thitherto
watched
everything
intently
seeing

ill
done

dom

there
the

moisture
wherewith
all

by
this
come
and
dom

drew
it
forth
saying

pietro
what
hast

done
did
i
not
bid
thee
say
not
a
word
for
aught
that
thou
shouldst

the

was

marred

over
again
henceforth

why
did

not

to
me
make
it
thou
more

not

for
the

to
set
it
on
so
well
as
i
the
young
woman
hearing
all
this
stood
up
and
said
to
her

in
all
good
faith
that
thou
art
why

thou
marred
thine
affairs
and
mine
what
mare

it
would
serve
thee
right

much
poorer

no

donned

woebegone

disconsolate
and
pietro
continuing
to
ply
his

trade
with
an
ass
as
he
was
used
betook
himself
in
company
with
dom
gianni
to
the
bitonto
fair
nor
ever
again
required
him
of
such
a
service
how
much
the
company
laughed
at
this
story
which
was
better
understood
of
the
ladies
than
dioneo
willed
let
her
who

thereat
imagine

the
day
stories
being
now
ended
and
the
sun
beginning
to
abate
of

the
queen
knowing
the
end

seignory
to

come
rose
to
her
feet

putting
off
the
crown
set
it
on
the
head
of
pamfilo

alone
it
remained
to
honour
after

thee
a
great
burden
inasmuch

with

my

of

lend
thee
grace

vouchsafed

blithely
received
the
honour
done
him
and
answered
your
merit

that
of
my
other
subjects
will
do
on
such
wise
that
i
shall
be
adjudged
deserving
of
commendation
even
as
the
others
have
been
then
having
according
to
the
usance
of
his
predecessors
taken
order
with
the
seneschal
of
the
things
that
were
needful
he
turned
to
the
expectant
ladies
and
said
to
them
lovesome
ladies
it
was
the
pleasure
of
emilia
who
hath
this
day
been
our
queen
to
give
you
for
the
purpose
of
affording
some
rest
to
your
powers
license
to
discourse
of
that
which
should
most
please
you
wherefore
you
being
now
rested
i
hold
it
well
to
return
to
the
wonted
ordinance
and
accordingly
i
will
that
each
of
you
bethink
herself
to
discourse
of
this
to
wit
of
whoso
hath
anywise
wrought
generously
or
magnificently
in
matters
of
love
or
otherwhat
the
telling
and
doing
of
these
things
will
doubtless
fire
your
minds
to
do
worthily
so
will
our
life
which
may
not
be
other
than
brief
in
this
mortal
body
be
made
perpetual
in
laudatory
renown
a
thing
which
all
who
serve
not
the
belly
only
as
do
the
beasts
should
not
only
desire
but
with
all
diligence
seek
and
endeavour

theme

joyous
company

having
all
with
the
new

arisen
from
session
gave
themselves
to
their
wonted
diversions
according
to
that
unto
which
each
was
most
drawn
by
desire
and
on
this
wise
they
did
until
the
hour
of
supper
whereunto
they
came
joyously
and
were
served
with
diligence
and
fair
ordinance
supper
at
an
end
they
arose
to
the
wonted
dances
and
after
they
had
sung
a
thousand
canzonets
more
diverting
of
words
than
masterly
of
music
the
king
bade
neifile
sing
one
in
her
own
name
whereupon
with
clear
and
blithesome
voice
she
cheerfully
and
without
delay
began

full
of

fare
unto
his

much
commended
both
of
the
king
and
of
the
other
ladies
after
which
for
that
a
great
part
of
the
night
was
now
spent
the
king
commanded
that
all
should
betake
themselves
to

day

ninth
day
of

tenth
and
last
day
of

decameron

under
the
governance
of
pamfilo
is
discoursed
of
whoso
hath
anywise
wrought
generously
or
magnificently
in
matters
of
love
or
otherwhat
certain
cloudlets
in
the

were
yet
vermeil
what
time
those
of
the
east
were
already
at
their
marges
grown
lucent
like
unto
very
gold
when
pamfilo
arising
let
call
his
comrades
and
the
ladies
who
being
all
come
he
took
counsel
with
them
of
whither
they
should
go
for
their
diversion
and
fared
forth
with
slow
step
accompanied
by
filomena
and
fiammetta
whilst
all
the
others
followed
after
on
this
wise
devising
and
telling
and
answering
many
things
of
their
future
life
together
they
went
a
great
while
then
having
made
a
pretty
long
circuit
and
the
sun
beginning
to
wax
overhot
they
returned
to
the
palace
there
they
let
rinse
the
beakers
in
the
clear
fountain
and
whoso
would
drank
somewhat
after
which
they
went
frolicking
among
the
pleasant
shades
of
the
garden
until
the
then
having
eaten
and
slept
as
of
their
wont
they
assembled
whereas
it
pleased
the
king
and
there
he
called
upon
neifile
for
the
first
discourse
who
blithely
began
thus
the
first
story
day
the
tenth
a
knight
in
the
king
service
of
spain
thinking
himself
ill
guerdoned
the
king
by
very
certain
proof
showeth
him
that
this
is
not
his
fault
but
that
of
his
own
perverse
fortune
and
after
largesseth
him
magnificently
needs
honourable
ladies
must
i
repute
it
a
singular
favour
to
myself
that
our
king
hath
preferred
me
unto
such
an
honour
as
it
is
to
be
the
first
to
tell
of
magnificence
the
which
even
as
the
sun
is
the
glory
and
adornment
of
all
the
heaven
is
the
light
and
lustre
of
every
other
virtue
i
will
therefore
tell
you
a
little
story
thereof
quaint
and
pleasant
enough
to
my
thinking
which
to
recall
can
certes
be
none
other
than
useful
you
must
know
then
that
among
the
other
gallant
gentlemen
who
have
from
time
immemorial
graced
our
city
there
was
one
and
maybe
the
most
of
worth
by
name
messer
ruggieri
de
figiovanni
who
being
both
rich
and
and
seeing
that
in
view
of
the
way
of
living
and
of
the
usages
of
tuscany
he
might
if
he
tarried
there
avail
to
display
little
or
nothing
of
his
merit
resolved
to
seek
service
awhile
with
alfonso
king
of
spain
the
renown
of
whose
valiance
transcended
that
of
every
other
prince
of
his
time
wherefore
he
betook
himself
very
honourably
furnished
with
arms
and
horses
and
followers
to
alfonso
in
spain
and
was
by
him
graciously
received
accordingly
he
took
up
his
abode
there
and
living
splendidly
and
doing
marvellous
deeds
of
arms
he
very
soon
made
himself
known
for
a
man
of
worth
and
valour
when
he
had
sojourned
there
a
pretty
while
and
had
taken
particular
note
of
the
king
fashions
himseemed
he
bestowed
castles
and
cities
and
baronies
now
upon
one
and
now
upon
another
with
little
enough
discretion
as
giving
them
to
those
who
were
unworthy
thereof
and
for
that
to
him
who
held
himself
for
that
which
he
was
nothing
was
given
he
conceived
that
his
repute
would
be
much
abated
by
reason
thereof
wherefore
he
determined
to
depart
and
craved
leave
of
the
king
the
latter
granted
him
the
leave
he
sought
and
gave
him
one
of
the
best
and
finest
mules
that
ever
was
ridden
the
which
for
the
long
journey
he
had
to
make
was
very
acceptable
to
messer
ruggieri
moreover
he
charged
a
discreet
servant
of
his
that
he
should
study
by
such
means
as
seemed
to
him
best
to
ride
with
messer
ruggieri
on
such
wise
that
he
should
not
appear
to
have
been
sent
by
the
king
and
note
everything
he
should
say
of
him
so
as
he
might
avail
to
repeat
it
to
him
and
that
on
the
ensuing
morning
he
should
command
him
return
to
the
court
accordingly
the
servant
lying
in
wait
for
messer
ruggieri
departure
accosted
him
as
he
came
forth
the
city
and
very
aptly
joined
company
with
him
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
also
was
bound
for
italy
messer
ruggieri
then
fared
on
riding
the
mule
given
him
by
the
king
and
devising
of
one
thing
and
another
with
the
latter
servant
till
hard
upon
tierce
when
he
said
it
were
well
done
to
let
our
beasts
stale
accordingly
they
put
them
up
in
a
stable
and
they
all
staled
except
the
mule
then
they
rode
on
again
whilst
the
squire
still
took
note
of
the
gentleman
words
and
came
presently
to
a
river
where
as
they
watered
their
cattle
the
mule
staled
in
the
stream
which
messer
ruggieri
seeing
quoth
he
confound
thee
beast
for
that
thou
art
made
after
the
same
fashion
as
the
prince
who
gave
thee
to
me
the
squire
noted
these
words
and
albeit
he
took
store
of
many
others
as
he
journeyed
with
him
all
that
day
he
heard
him
say
nought
else
but
what
was
to
the
highest
praise
of
the
king
next
morning
they
being
mounted
and
ruggieri
offering
to
ride
towards
tuscany
the
squire
imparted
to
him
the
king
commandment
whereupon
he
incontinent
turned
back
when
he
arrived
at
court
the
king
learning
what
he
had
said
of
the
mule
let
call
him
to
himself
and
receiving
him
with
a
cheerful
favour
asked
him
why
he
had
likened
him
to
his
mule
or
rather
why
he
had
likened
the
mule
to
him
lord
replied
ruggieri
frankly
likened
her
to
you
for
that
like
as
you
give
whereas
it
behoveth
not
and
give
not
whereas
it
behoveth
even
so
she
staled
not
whereas
it
behoved
but
staled
whereas
it
behoved
not
then
said
the
king
ruggieri
if
i
have
not
given
to
you
as
i
have
given
unto
many
who
are
of
no
account
in
comparison
with
you
it
happened
not
because
i
knew
you
not
for
a
most
valiant
cavalier
and
worthy
of
every
great
gift
nay
but
it
is
your
fortune
which
hath
not
suffered
me
guerdon
you
according
to
your
deserts
that
hath
sinned
in
this
and
not
i
and
that
i
may
say
sooth
i
will
manifestly
prove
to
you
lord
replied
ruggieri
was
not
chagrined
because
i
have
gotten
no
largesse
of
you
for
that
i
desire
not
to
be
richer
than
i
am
but
because
you
have
on
no
wise
borne
witness
to
my
merit
natheless
i
hold
your
excuse
for
good
and
honourable
and
am
ready
to
see
that
which
it
shall
please
you
show
me
albeit
i
believe
you
without
proof
the
king
then
carried
him
into
a
great
hall
of
his
where
as
he
had
ordered
it
beforehand
were
two
great
locked
coffers
and
said
to
him
in
presence
of
many
ruggieri
in
one
of
these
coffers
is
my
crown
the
royal
sceptre
and
the
orb
together
with
many
goodly
girdles
and
ouches
and
rings
of
mine
and
in
fine
every
precious
jewel
i
have
and
the
other
is
full
of
earth
take
then
one
and
be
that
which
you
shall
take
yours
and
you
may
thus
see
whether
of
the
twain
hath
been
ungrateful
to
your
worth
myself
of
your
ill
fortune
messer
ruggieri
seeing
that
it
was
the
king
pleasure
took
one
of
the
coffers
which
being
opened
by
alfonso
commandment
was
found
to
be
that
which
was
full
of
earth
whereupon
quoth
the
king
laughing
can
you
see
messer
ruggieri
that
this
that
i
tell
you
of
your
fortune
is
true
but
certes
your
worth
meriteth
that
i
should
oppose
myself
to
her
might
i
know
you
have
no
mind
to
turn
spaniard
and
therefore
i
will
bestow
upon
you
neither
castle
nor
city
in
these
parts
but
this
coffer
of
which
fortune
deprived
you
i
will
in
her
despite
shall
be
yours
so
you
may
carry
it
off
to
your
own
country
and
justly
glorify
yourself
of
your
worth
in
the
sight
of
your
countrymen
by
the
witness
of
my
gifts
messer
ruggieri
accordingly
took
the
coffer
and
having
rendered
the
king
those
thanks
which
sorted
with
such
a
gift
joyfully
returned
therewith
to
tuscany
the
second
story
day
the
tenth
ghino
di
tacco
taketh
the
abbot
of
cluny
and
having
cured
him
of
the
letteth
him
go
whereupon
the
abbot
returning
to
the
court
of
rome
reconcileth
him
with
pope
boniface
and
maketh
him
a
prior
of
the
hospitallers
the
magnificence
shown
by
king
alfonso
to
the
florentine
cavalier
having
been
duly
commended
the
king
who
had
been
mightily
pleased
therewith
enjoined
elisa
to
follow
on
and
she
straightway
began
thus
dainty
dames
it
can
not
be
denied
that
for
a
king
to
be
munificent
and
to
have
shown
his
munificence
to
him
who
had
served
him
is
a
great
and
a
praiseworthy
thing
but
what
shall
we
say
if
a
churchman
be
related
to
have
practised
marvellous
magnanimity
towards
one
whom
if
he
had
used
as
an
enemy
he
had
of
none
been
blamed
therefor
certes
we
can
say
none
otherwise
than
that
the
magnificence
was
a
virtue
whilst
that
of
the
churchman
was
a
miracle
inasmuch
as
the
clergy
are
all
exceeding
niggardly
nay
far
more
so
than
women
and
sworn
enemies
of
all
manner
of
liberality
and
albeit
all
men
naturally
hunger
after
vengeance
for
affronts
received
we
see
churchmen
for
all
they
preach
patience
and
especially
commend
the
remission
of
offences
pursue
it
more
eagerly
than
other
folk
this
then
to
wit
how
a
churchman
was
magnanimous
you
may
manifestly
learn
from
the
following
story
of
mine
ghino
di
tacco
a
man
very
famous
for
his
cruelty
and
his
robberies
being
expelled
transcriber
note
missing
siena
and
at
feud
with
the
counts
of
santa
fiore
raised
radicofani
against
the
church
of
rome
and
taking
up
his
sojourn
there
caused
his
swashbucklers
despoil
whosoever
passed
through
the
surrounding
country
now
boniface
the
eighth
being
pope
in
rome
there
came
to
court
the
abbot
of
cluny
who
is
believed
to
be
one
of
the
richest
prelates
in
the
world
and
having
there
marred
his
stomach
he
was
advised
by
the
physicians
to
repair
to
the
baths
of
siena
and
he
would
without
fail
be
cured
accordingly
having
gotten
the
pope
leave
he
set
out
on
his
way
thither
in
great
pomp
of
gear
and
baggage
and
horses
and
servitors
unrecking
of
ghino
ill
report
the
latter
hearing
of
his
coming
spread
his
nets
and
hemmed
him
and
all
his
household
and
gear
about
in
a
strait
place
without
letting
a
single
footboy
escape
this
done
he
despatched
to
the
abbot
one
the
most
sufficient
of
his
men
well
accompanied
who
in
his
name
very
lovingly
prayed
him
be
pleased
to
light
down
and
sojourn
with
the
aforesaid
ghino
in
his
castle
the
abbot
hearing
this
answered
furiously
that
he
would
nowise
do
it
having
nought
to
do
with
ghino
but
that
he
would
fare
on
and
would
fain
see
who
should
forbid
his
passage
whereto
quoth
the
messenger
on
humble
wise
you
are
come
into
parts
where
barring
god
his
might
there
is
nothing
to
fear
for
us
and
where
excommunications
and
interdicts
are
all
excommunicated
wherefore
may
it
please
you
you
were
best
comply
with
ghino
in
this
during
this
parley
the
whole
place
had
been
encompassed
about
with
wherefore
the
abbot
seeing
himself
taken
with
his
men
betook
himself
sore
against
his
will
to
the
castle
in
company
with
the
ambassador
and
with
him
all
his
household
and
gear
and
alighting
there
was
by
ghino
orders
lodged
all
alone
in
a
very
dark
and
mean
little
chamber
in
one
of
the
pavilions
whilst
every
one
else
was
well
enough
accommodated
according
to
his
quality
about
the
castle
and
the
horses
and
all
the
gear
put
in
safety
without
aught
thereof
being
touched
this
done
ghino
betook
himself
to
the
abbot
and
said
to
him
ghino
whose
guest
you
are
sendeth
to
you
praying
you
acquaint
him
whither
you
are
bound
and
on
what
occasion
the
abbot
like
a
wise
man
had
by
this
laid
by
his
pride
and
told
him
whither
he
went
and
why
ghino
hearing
this
took
his
leave
and
bethought
himself
to
go
about
to
cure
him
without
baths
accordingly
he
let
keep
a
great
fire
still
burning
in
the
little
room
and
causing
guard
the
place
well
returned
not
to
the
abbot
till
the
following
morning
when
he
brought
him
in
a
very
white
napkin
two
slices
of
toasted
bread
and
a
great
beaker
of
his
own
corniglia
vernage
and
bespoke
him
thus
when
ghino
was
young
he
studied
medicine
and
saith
that
he
learned
there
was
no
better
remedy
for
the
than
that
which
he
purposeth
to
apply
to
you
and
of
which
these
things
that
i
bring
you
are
the
beginning
wherefore
do
you
take
them
and
refresh
yourself
footnote
see
note
the
abbot
whose
hunger
was
greater
than
his
desire
to
bandy
words
ate
the
bread
and
drank
the
wine
though
he
did
it
with
an
ill
will
and
after
made
many
haughty
speeches
asking
and
counselling
of
many
things
and
demanding
in
particular
to
see
ghino
the
latter
hearing
this
talk
let
part
of
it
pass
as
idle
and
answered
the
rest
very
courteously
avouching
that
ghino
would
visit
him
as
quickliest
he
might
this
said
he
took
his
leave
of
him
and
returned
not
until
the
ensuing
day
when
he
brought
him
as
much
toasted
bread
and
as
much
malmsey
and
so
he
kept
him
several
days
till
such
time
as
he
perceived
that
he
had
eaten
some
dried
beans
which
he
had
of
intent
aforethought
brought
secretly
thither
and
left
there
whereupon
he
asked
him
on
ghino
part
how
he
found
himself
about
the
stomach
the
abbot
answered
i
should
fare
well
were
i
but
out
of
his
hands
and
after
that
i
have
no
greater
desire
than
to
eat
so
well
have
his
remedies
cured
me
thereupon
ghino
caused
the
own
people
array
him
a
goodly
chamber
with
his
own
gear
and
let
make
ready
a
magnificent
banquet
to
which
he
bade
the
prelate
whole
household
together
with
many
folk
of
the
burgh
next
morning
he
betook
himself
to
the
abbot
and
said
to
him
since
you
feel
yourself
well
it
is
time
to
leave
the
infirmary
then
taking
him
by
the
hand
he
brought
him
to
the
chamber
prepared
for
him
and
leaving
him
there
in
company
of
his
own
people
occupied
himself
with
caring
that
the
banquet
should
be
a
magnificent
one
the
abbot
solaced
himself
awhile
with
his
men
and
told
them
what
his
life
had
been
since
his
capture
whilst
they
on
the
other
hand
avouched
themselves
all
to
have
been
entreated
of
ghino
the
come
the
abbot
and
the
rest
were
well
and
orderly
served
with
goodly
viands
and
fine
wines
without
ghino
yet
letting
himself
be
known

the
prelate

after
the
latter
had
abidden
some
days
on
this
wise
the
outlaw
having
let
bring
all
his
gear
into
one
saloon
and
all
his
horses
down
to
the
sorriest
rouncey
into
a
courtyard
that
was
under
the
windows
thereof
betook
himself
to
him
and
asked
him
how
he
did
and
if
he
deemed
himself
strong
enough
to
take
horse
the
abbot
answered
that
he
was
strong
enough
and
quite
recovered
of
his
and
that
he
should
fare
perfectly
well
once
he
should
be
out
of
ghino
hands
ghino
then
brought
him
into
the
saloon
wherein
was
his
gear
and
all
his
train

carrying
him
to
a
window
whence
he
might
see
all
his
horses
said
lord
abbot
you
must
know
that
it
was
the
being
a
gentleman
and
expelled
from
his
house
and
poor
and
having
many
and
puissant
enemies
and
not
evilness
of
mind
that
brought
ghino
di
tacco
who
is
none
other
than
myself
to
be
for
the
defence
of
his
life
and
his
nobility
a
and
an
enemy
of
the
court
of
rome
nevertheless
for
that
you
seem
to
me
a
worthy
gentleman
i
purpose
not
now
that
i
have
cured
you
of
your
to
use
you
as
i
would
another
from
whom
he
being
in
my
hands
as
you
are
i
would
take
for
myself
such
part
of
his
goods
as
seemed
well
to
me
nay
it
is
my
intent
that
you
having
regard
to
my
need
shall
appoint
to
me
such
part
of
your
good
as
you
yourself
will
it
is
all
here
before
you
in
its
entirety
and
your
horses
you
may
from
this
window
see
in
the
courtyard
take
therefore
both
part
and
all
as
it
pleaseth
you
and
from
this
time
forth
be
it
at
your
pleasure
to
go
or
to
stay
the
abbot
marvelled
to
hear
such
generous
words
from
a
and
was
exceeding
well
pleased
therewith
insomuch
that
his
anger
and
despite
being
of
a
sudden
fallen
nay
changed
into
goodwill
he
became
ghino
hearty
friend
and
ran
to
embrace
him
saying
vow
to
god
that
to
gain
the
friendship
of
a
man
such
as
i
presently
judge
thee
to
be
i
would
gladly
consent
to
suffer
a
far
greater
affront
than
that
which
meseemed
but
now
thou
hadst
done
me
accursed
be
fortune
that
constrained
thee
to
so
damnable
a
trade
then
letting
take
of
his
many
goods
but
a
very
few
necessary
things
and
the
like
of
his
horses
he
left
all
the
rest
to
ghino
and
returned
to
rome
the
pope
had
had
news
of
the
taking
of
the
abbot
and
albeit
it
had
given
him
sore
concern
he
asked
him
when
he
saw
him
how
the
baths
had
profited
him
whereto
he
replied
smiling
father
i
found
a
worthy
physician
nearer
than
at
the
baths
who
hath
excellently
well
cured
me
and
told
him
how
whereat
the
pope
laughed
and
the
abbot
following
on
his
speech
and
moved
by
a
magnanimous
spirit
craved
a
boon
of
him
the
pope
thinking
he
would
demand
otherwhat
freely
offered
to
do
that
which
he
should
ask
and
the
abbot
said
father
that
which
i
mean
to
ask
of
you
is
that
you
restore
your
favour
to
ghino
di
tacco
my
physician
for
that
of
all
the
men
of
worth
and
high
account
whom
i
ever
knew
he
is
certes
one
of
the
most
deserving
and
for
this
ill
that
he
doth
i
hold
it
much
more
fortune
fault
than
his
the
which
if
you
change
by
bestowing
on
him
somewhat
whereby
he
may
live
according
to
his
condition
i
doubt
not
anywise
but
you
will
in
brief
space
of
time
deem
of
him
even
as
i
do
the
pope
who
was
great
of
soul
and
a
lover
of
men
of
worth
hearing
this
replied
that
he

gladly
do
it

indeed
of

the
abbot
avouched
and

ghino
at

came
to

upon

in

of
cattajo
a
man
of
noble
lineage
and
rich
beyond
compare
called
nathan
who
having
an
estate
adjoining
a
highway
whereby
as
of
necessity
passed
all
who
sought
to
go
from
the
ponant
to
the
levant
or
from
the
levant
to
the
ponant
and
being
a
man
of
great
and
generous
soul
and
desirous
that
it
should
be
known
by
his
works
assembled
a
great
multitude
of
artificers
and
let
build
there
in
a
little
space
of
time
one
of
the
fairest
and
greatest
and
richest
palaces
that
had
ever
been
seen
the
which
he
caused
excellently
well
furnished
with
all
that
was
apt
unto
the
reception
and
entertainment
of
gentlemen
then
having
a
great
and
goodly
household
he
there
received
and
honourably
entertained
with
joyance
and
good
cheer
whosoever
came
and
went
and
in
this
praiseworthy
usance
he
persevered
insomuch
that
not
only
the
levant
but
well
nigh
all
the
ponant
knew
him
by
report
he
was
already
full
of
years
nor
was
therefore
grown
weary
of
the
practice
of
hospitality
when
it
chanced
that
his
fame
reached
the
ears
of
a
young
man
of
a
country
not
far
from
his
own
by
name
mithridanes
who
knowing
himself
no
less
rich
than
nathan
and
waxing
envious
of
his
renown
and
his
virtues
bethought
himself
to
eclipse
or
shadow
them
with
greater
liberality
accordingly
letting
build
a
palace
like
unto
that
of
nathan
he
proceeded
to
do
the
most
unbounded
courtesies
that
ever
any
did
whosoever
came
or
went
about
those
parts
and
in
a
short
time
he
became
without
doubt
very
famous

footnote
to
show
the
most
extravagant
hospitality
it
chanced
one
day
that
as
he
abode
all
alone
in
the
midcourt
of
his
palace
there
came
in
by
one
of
the
gates
a
poor
woman
who
sought
of
him
an
alms
and
had
it
then
coming
in
again
to
him
by
the
second
she
had
of
him
another
alms
and
so
on
for
twelve
times
in
succession
but
whenas
she
returned
for
the
thirteenth
time
he
said
to
her
woman
thou
art
very
diligent
in
this
thine
asking
and
natheless
gave
her
an
alms
the
old
crone
hearing
these
words
exclaimed
liberality
of
nathan
how
marvellous
art
thou
for
that
entering
in
by
each
of
the
gates
which
his
palace
hath
and
asking
of
him
an
alms
never
for
all
that
he
showed
was
i
recognized
of
him
and
still
i
had
it
whilst
here
having
as
yet
come
in
but
at
thirteen
gates
i
have
been
both
recognized
and
chidden
so
saying
she
went
her
ways
and
returned
thither
no
more
mithridanes
hearing
the
old
woman
words
flamed
up
into
a
furious
rage
as
he
who
held
that
which
he
heard
of
nathan
fame
a
diminishment
of
his
own
and
fell
to
saying
woe
is
me
when
shall
i
attain
to
nathan
liberality
in
great
things
let
alone
overpass
it
as
i
seek
to
do
seeing
that
i
can
not
approach
him
in
the
smallest
verily
i
weary
myself
in
vain
an
i
remove
him
not
from
the
earth
wherefore
since
eld
carrieth
him
not
off
needs
must
i
with
mine
own
hands
do
it
without
delay
accordingly
rising
upon
that
motion
he
took
horse
with
a
small
company
without
communicating
his
design
to
any
and
came
after
three
days
whereas
nathan
abode
he
arrived
there
at
eventide
and
bidding
his
followers
make
a
show
of
not
being
with
him
and
provide
themselves
with
lodging
against
they
should
hear
farther
from
him
abode
alone
at
no
great
distance
from
the
fair
palace
where
he
found
nathan
all
unattended
as
he
went
walking
for
his
diversion
without
any
pomp
of
apparel
and
knowing
him
not
asked
him
if
he
could
inform
him
where
nathan
dwelt
son
answered
the
latter
cheerfully
is
none
in
these
parts
who
is
better
able
than
i
to
show
thee
that
wherefore
whenas
it
pleaseth
thee
i
will
carry
thee
thither
mithridanes
rejoined
that
this
would
be
very
acceptable
to
him
but
that
an
it
might
be
he
would
fain
be
neither
seen
nor
known
of
nathan
and
the
latter
said
also
will
i
do
since
it
pleaseth
thee
mithridanes
accordingly
dismounted
and
repaired
to
the
goodly
palace
in
company
with
nathan
who
quickly
engaged
him
in
most
pleasant
discourse
there
he
caused
one
of
his
servants
take
the
young
horse
and
putting
his
mouth
to
his
ear
charged
him
take
order
with
all
those
of
the
house
so
none
should
tell
the
youth
that
he
was
nathan
and
so
was
it
done
moreover
he
lodged
him
in
a
very
goodly
chamber
where
none
saw
him
save
those
whom
he
had
deputed
to
this
service
and
let
entertain
him
with
the
utmost
honour
himself
bearing
him
company
after
mithridanes
had
abidden
with
him
awhile
on
this
wise
he
asked
him
albeit
he
held
him
in
reverence
as
a
father
who
he
was
to
which
nathan
answered
am
an
unworthy
servant
of
nathan
who
have
grown
old
with
him
from
my
childhood
nor
hath
he
ever
advanced
me
to
otherwhat
than
that
which
thou
seest
me
wherefore
albeit
every
one
else
is
mighty
well
pleased
with
him
i
for
my
part
have
little
cause
to
thank
him
these
words
afforded
mithridanes
some
hope
of
availing
with
more
certitude
and
more
safety
to
give
effect
to
his
perverse
design
and
nathan
very
courteously
asking
him
who
he
was
and
what
occasion
brought
him
into
those
parts
and
proffering
him
his
advice
and
assistance
insomuch
as
lay
in
his
power
he
hesitated
awhile
to
reply
but
presently
resolving
to
trust
himself
to
him
he
with
a
long
circuit
of
words
required
him
first
of
secrecy
and
after
of
aid
and
counsel
and
entirely
discovered
to
him
who
he
was
and
wherefore
and
on
what
motion
he
came
nathan
hearing
his
discourse
and
his
cruel
design
was
inwardly
all
disordered
but
nevertheless
without
much
hesitation
he
answered
him
with
an
undaunted
mind
and
a
firm
countenance
saying
thy
father
was
a
noble
man
and
thou
showest
thyself
minded
not
to
degenerate
from
him
in
having
entered
upon
so
high
an
emprise
as
this
thou
hast
undertaken
to
wit
to
be
liberal
unto
all
and
greatly
do
i
commend
the
jealousy
thou
bearest
unto
nathan
virtues
for
that
were
there
many
such
the
world
that
is
most
wretched
would
soon
become
good
the
design
that
thou
hast
discovered
to
me
i
will
without
fail
keep
secret
but
for
the
accomplishment
thereof
i
can
rather
give
thee
useful
counsel
than
great
help
the
which
is
this
thou
mayst
from
here
see
a
coppice
maybe
half
a
mile
hence
wherein
nathan
well
nigh
every
morning
walketh
all
alone
taking
his
pleasure
there
a
pretty
long
while
and
there
it
will
be
a
light
matter
to
thee
to
find
him
and
do
thy
will
of
him
if
thou
slay
him
thou
must
so
thou
mayst
return
home
without
hindrance
get
thee
gone
not
by
that
way
thou
camest
but
by
that
which
thou
wilt
see
issue
forth
of
the
coppice
on
the
left
hand
for
that
albeit
it
is
somewhat
wilder
it
is
nearer
to
thy
country
and
safer
for
thee

mithridanes

betook
himself

mithridanes
arose
and
taking
his
bow

his

for

he
had
not

made
for

thou

him
forthright

had
so
lovingly

him
and
familiarly
companied
with

faithfully
counselled
him
whereupon
his
fury
incontinent
subsided

was
changed
into
shame
accordingly
casting
away
the
sword
which
he
had
already
pulled
out
to
smite
him
and
lighting
down
from
his
horse
he
ran
weeping
to
throw
himself
at

said
to
him
dearest

do

recognize
your

with

you

give
me
your

without

i

of

i
myself

in

raised
mithridanes
to

tenderly
embraced

him
saying

be
assured
that
there
is
no
man
alive
who
loveth
thee
as
i
do
having
regard
to
the
loftiness
of
thy
soul
which
hath
given
itself
not
to
the
amassing
of
monies
as
do
the
covetous
but
to
the
expenditure
of
those
that
have
been
amassed
neither
be
thou
ashamed
of
having
sought
to
slay
me
so
though
mightest
become
famous

think
that
i
marvel
thereat
the
greatest
emperors
and
the
most
illustrious
kings
have
with
well
nigh
none
other
art
than
that
of
slaying
not
one
man
as
thou
wouldst
have
done
but
an
infinite
multitude
of
men
and
burning
countries
and
razing
cities
enlarged
their
realms
and
consequently
their
fame
wherefore
an
thou
wouldst
to
make
thyself
more
famous
have
slain
me

thou
diddest
no
new
nor
extraordinary
thing
but
one
much
used
mithridanes
without
holding
himself
excused
of
his
perverse
design
commended
the
honourable
excuse
found
by
nathan
and
came
in
course
of
converse
with
him
to
say
that
he
marvelled
beyond
measure
how
he
could
have
brought
himself
to
meet
his
death
and
have
gone
so
far
as
even
to
give
him
means
and
counsel
to
that
end
whereto
quoth
nathan
i
would
not
have
thee
marvel
at
my
resolution
nor
at
the
counsel
i
gave
thee
for
that
since
i
have
been
mine
own
master
and
have
addressed
myself
to
do
that
same
thing
which
thou
hast
undertaken
to
do
there
came
never
any
to
my
house
but
i
contented
him
so
far
as
in
me
lay
of
that
which
was
required
of
me
by
him
thou
camest
hither
desirous
of
my
life
wherefore
learning
that
thou
soughtest
it
i
straightway
determined
to
give
it
thee
so
thou
mightest
not
be
the
only
one
to
depart
hence
without
his
wish
and
in
order
that
thou
mightest
have
thy
desire
i
gave
thee
such
counsel
as
i
thought
apt
to
enable
thee
to
have
my
life
and
not
lose
thine
own
and
therefore
i
tell
thee
once
more
and
pray
thee
an
it
please
thee
take
it
and
satisfy
thyself
thereof
i
know
not
how
i
may
better
bestow
it
these
fourscore
years
have
i
occupied
it
and
used
it
about
my
pleasures
and
my
diversions
and
i
know
that
in
the
course
of
nature
according
as
it
fareth
with
other
men
and
with
things
in
general
it
can
now
be
left
me
but
a
little
while
longer
wherefore
i
hold
it
far
better
to
bestow
it
by
way
of
gift
like
as
i
have
still
given
and
expended
my
other
treasures
than
to
seek
to
keep
it
until
such
times
as
it
shall
be
taken
from
me
by
nature
against
my
will
to
give
an
hundred
years
is
no
great
boon

much
less

is
it
to

from

your

even

i
did
your
life
whose
years
far
from
seeking
to
lessen
i
would
willingly
add
thereto
of
mine
own
whereto
nathan
straightway
rejoined
art
thou
indeed
willing
it
being
in
thy
power
to
do
it
to
add
of
thy
years
unto
mine
and
in
so
doing
to
cause
me
do
for
thee
that
which
i
never
yet
did
for
any
man
to

take
of
thy
good
i
who
never

took
aught

myself

mithridanes
i
knew
how
to
do
as
well
as
you
have
done
and
do
i
would
without
hesitation
take
that
which
you
proffer
me
but
since
meseemeth
very
certain
that
my
actions
would
be
a
diminishment
of
nathan

as
i

not
to
mar
in
another
that
which
i

not
how
to

him

mithridanes

there
was
then
in
bologna
a
very
noble
city
of
lombardy
a
gentleman
very
notable
for
virtue
and
nobility
of
blood
called
messer
gentile
carisendi
who
being
young
became
enamoured
of
a
noble
lady
called
madam
catalina
the
wife
of
one
niccoluccio
caccianimico
and
for
that
he
was
ill
repaid
of
his
love
by
the
lady
being
named
provost
of
modona
he
betook
himself
thither
as
in
despair
of
her
meanwhile
niccoluccio
being
absent
from
bologna
and
the
lady
having
for
that
she
was
with
child
gone
to
abide
at
a
country
house
she
had
maybe
three
miles
distant
from
the
city
she
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
grievous
fit
of
sickness
which
overcame
her
with
such
violence
that
it
extinguished
in
her
all
sign
of
life
so
that
she
was
even
adjudged
dead
of
divers
physicians
and
for
that
her
nearest
kinswomen
declared
themselves
to
have
had
it
from
herself
that
she
had
not
been
so
long
pregnant
that
the
child
could
be
fully
formed
without
giving
themselves
farther
concern

buried
her

as
she
was
after
much
lamentation
in

accident
the
thing
was
forthright
signified
by
a
friend
of
his
to
messer
gentile
who
poor
as
he
had
still
been
of
her
favour
grieved
sore
therefor
and
ultimately
said
in
himself
madam
catalina
thou
art
dead
thou
of
whom
what
while
thou
livedst
i
could
never
avail
to
have
so
much
as
a
look
wherefore
now
thou
canst
not
defend
thyself
needs
must
i
take
of
thee
a
kiss
or
two
all
dead
as
thou
art
this
said
he
took
order
so
his
going
should
be
secret
and
it
being
presently
night
he
mounted
to
horse
with
one
of
his
servants
and
rode
without
halting
till
he
came
whereas
the
lady
was
buried
and
opened
the
sepulchre
with
all
despatch
then
entering
therein
he
laid
himself
beside
her
and
putting
his
face
to
hers
kissed
her
again
and
again
with
many
tears
but
presently
as
we
see
men
appetites
never
abide
content
within
any
limit
but
still
desire
farther
and
especially
those
of
lovers
having
bethought
himself
to
tarry
there
no
longer
he
said
now
that
i
am
here
why
should
i
not
touch
her
somedele
on
the
breast
i
may
never
touch
her
more
nor
have
i
ever
yet
done
so
accordingly
overcome
with
this
desire
he
put
his
hand
into
her
bosom
and
holding
it
there
awhile
himseemed
he
felt
her
heart
beat
somewhat
thereupon
putting
aside
all
fear
he
sought
more
diligently
and
found
that
she
was
certainly
not
dead
scant
and
feeble
as
he
deemed
the
life
that
lingered
in
her
wherefore
with
the
help
of
his
servant
he
brought
her
forth
of
the
tomb
as
softliest
he
might
and
setting
her
before
him
on
his
horse
carried
her
privily
to
his
house
in
bologna
there
was
his
mother
a
worthy
and
discreet
gentlewoman
and
she
after
she
had
heard
everything
at
large
from
her
son
moved
to
compassion
quietly
addressed
herself
by
means
of
hot
baths
and
great
fires
to
recall
the
strayed
life
to
the
lady
who
coming
presently
to
herself
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
said
me
where
am
i
to
which
the
good
lady
replied
of
good
comfort
thou
art
in
safety
madam
catalina
collecting
herself
looked
about
her
and
knew
not
aright
where
she
was
but
seeing
messer
gentile
before
her
she
was
filled
with
wonderment
and
besought
his
mother
to
tell
her
how
she
came
thither
whereupon
messer
gentile
related
to
her
everything
in
order
at
this
she
was
sore
afflicted
but
presently
rendered
him
such
thanks
as
she
might
and
after
conjured
him
by
the
love
he
had
erst
borne
her
and
of
his
courtesy
that
she
might
not
in
his
house
suffer
at
his
hands
aught
that
should
be
anywise
contrary
to
her
honour
and
that
of
her
husband
and
that
as
soon
as
the
day
should
be
come
he
would
suffer
her
return
to
her
own
house
answered
messer
gentile
may
have
been
my
desire
of
time
past
i
purpose
not
either
at
this
present
or
ever
henceforth
since
god
hath
vouchsafed
me
this
grace
that
he
hath
restored
you
to
me
from
death
to
life
and
that
by
means
of
the
love
i
have
hitherto
borne
you
to
use
you
either
here
or
elsewhere
otherwise
than
as
a
dear
sister
but
this
my
service
that
i
have
done
you
meriteth
some
recompense
wherefore
i
would
have
you
deny
me
not
a
favour
that
i
shall
ask
you
the
lady
very
graciously
replied
that
she
was
ready
to
do
his
desire
so
but
she
might
and
it
were
honourable
then
said
he
your
kinsfolk
and
all
the
bolognese
believe
and
hold
you
for
certain
to
be
dead
wherefore
there
is
no
one
who
looketh
for
you
more
at
home
and
therefore
i
would
have
you
of
your
favour
be
pleased
to
abide
quietly
here
with
my
mother
till
such
time
as
i
shall
return
from
modona
which
will
be
soon
and
the
reason
for
which
i
require
you
of
this
is
that
i
purpose
to
make
a
dear
and
solemn
present
of
you
to
your
husband
in
the
presence
of
the
most
notable
citizens
of
this
place

lady
confessing
herself
beholden
to
the
gentleman
and
that
his
request
was
an
honourable
one
determined
to
do
as
he
asked
how
much
soever
she
desired
to
gladden
her
kinsfolk
of
her
life
and
so
she
promised
it
to
him
upon
her
faith
hardly
had
she
made
an
end
of
her
reply
when
she
felt
the
time
of
her
delivery
to
be
come
and
not
long
after
being
lovingly
tended
of
messer
gentile
mother
she
gave
birth
to
a
goodly
male
child
which
manifold
redoubled
his
gladness
and
her
own
messer
gentile
took
order
that
all
things
needful
should
be
forthcoming
and
that
she
should
be
tended
as
she
were
his
proper
wife
and
presently
returned
in
secret
to
modona
there
having
served
the
term
of
his
office
and
being
about
to
return
to
bologna
he
took
order
for
the
holding
of
a
great
and
goodly
banquet
at
his
house
on
the
morning

was
to
enter
the
city

thereto
he
bade
many
gentlemen
of
the
place
amongst
whom
was
niccoluccio
caccianimico

when
he
returned

dismounted
he
found
them
all

the
lady
fairer

sounder
than
ever
and
her
little
son

custom
i
purpose

observe
in

you
of
your
favour
have
honoured
my
banquet

you
after
the
persian
fashion

you
the
most
precious
thing
i
have

ever
have
in

ere

to

him
off

would
fain
know
whether

his

committed
the
response
to
niccoluccio
caccianimico
for
that
he
was

speaker
whereupon
the

having
first
commended
the

declared
that
he

of
opinion
that
the

master
had
no

his
servant

in

at
table
and
there
were
men
there
of
worth
and
worship
said
all
of
one
accord
that
they
held
to
that
which
had
been
answered
by
niccoluccio
and
messer
gentile
well
pleased
with
this
response
and
that
niccoluccio
had
made
it
avouched
himself
also
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
then
said
he
is
now
time
that
i
honour
you
according
to
promise
and
calling
two
of
his
servants
despatched
them
to
the
lady
whom
he
had
let
magnificently
dress
and
adorn
praying
her
be
pleased
to
come
gladden
the
company
with
her
presence
accordingly
she
took
her
little
son
who
was
very
handsome
in
her
arms
and
coming
into
the
attended
by
two
seated
herself
as
messer
gentile
willed
it
by
the
side
of
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
then
said
he
this
is
the
thing
which
i
hold
and
purpose
to
hold
dearer
than
any
other
look
if
it
seem
to
you
that
i
have
reason
to
do
so
the
guests
having
paid
her
the
utmost
honour
commending
her
amain
and
declaring
to
messer
gentile
that
he
might
well
hold
her
dear
fell
to
looking
upon
her
and
there
were
many
there
who
had
avouched
her
to
be
herself
had
they
not
held
her
for
dead
but
niccoluccio
gazed
upon
her
above
all
and
unable
to
contain
himself
asked
her
messer
gentile
having
withdrawn
awhile
as
one
who
burned
to
know
who
she
was
if
she
were
a
bolognese
lady
or
a
foreigner
the
lady
seeing
herself
questioned
of
her
husband
hardly
restrained
herself
from
answering
but
yet
to
observe
the
appointed
ordinance
she
held
her
peace
another
asked
her
if
the
child
was
hers
and
a
third
if
she
were
messer
gentile
wife
or
anywise
akin
to
him
but
she
made
them
no
reply
presently
messer
gentile
coming
up
one
of
his
guests
said
to
him
this
is
a
fair
creature
of
yours
but
she
seemeth
to
us
mute
is
she
so
replied
he
not
having
spoken
at
this
present
is
no
small
proof
of
her
virtue
and
the
other
said
us
then
who
she
is
quoth
messer
gentile
will
i
gladly
so
but
you
will
promise
me
that
none
for
aught
that
i
shall
say
will
budge
from
his
place
till
such
time
as
i
shall
have
made
an
end
of
my
story

who
would
have
recognized
her
as
madam
catalina
all
promised
this
and
the
tables
being
presently
removed
messer
gentile
seating
himself
beside
the
lady
said
this
lady
is
that
loyal
and
faithful
servant
of
whom
i
questioned
you
awhile
agone
and
who
being
held
little
dear
of
her
folk
and
so
as
a
thing
without
worth
and
no
longer
useful
cast
out
into
the
midward
of
the
street
was
by
me
taken
up
yea
by
my
solicitude
and
of
my
handiwork
i
brought
her
forth
of
the
jaws
of
death
and
god
having
regard
to
my
good
intent
hath
caused
her
by
my
means
from
a
frightful
corpse
become
thus
beautiful
but
that
you
may
more
manifestly
apprehend
how
this
betided
me
i
will
briefly
declare
it
to
you
then
beginning
from
his
falling
enamoured
of
her
he
particularly
related
to
them
that
which
had
passed
until
that
time
to
the
great
wonderment
of
the
hearers
and
added
reason
of
which
things
an
you
and
especially
niccoluccio
have
not
changed
counsel
since
awhile
ago
the
lady
is
fairly
mine
nor
can
any
with
just
title
demand
her
again
of
me
to
this
none
made
answer
nay
all
awaited
that
which
he
should
say
farther
whilst
niccoluccio
and
the
lady
and
certain
of
the
others
who
were
there
wept
for
compassion

emotion
then
messer
gentile
rising
to
his
feet
and
taking
the
little
child
in
his
arms
and
the
lady
by
the
hand
made
for
niccoluccio
and
said
to
him
up
gossip
i
do
not
restore
thee
thy
wife
whom
thy
kinsfolk
and
hers
cast
away
nay
but
i
will
well
bestow
on
thee
this
lady
my
gossip
with
this
her
little
son
who
i
am
assured
was
begotten
of
thee
and
whom
i
held
at
baptism
and
named
gentile
and
i
pray
thee
that
she
be
none
the
less
dear
to
thee
for
that
she
hath
abidden
near
upon
three
months
in
my
house
for
i
swear
to
thee
by
that
god
who
belike
caused
me
aforetime
fall
in
love
with
her
to
the
intent
that
my
love
might
be

in

hath
been
the
occasion
of
her
deliverance
that
never
whether
with

she
lived
more
chastely
than
she
hath
done

my
house

saying
he
turned
to
the
lady
and
said
to
her
from
this
time
forth
i
absolve
you
of
every
promise
made
me
and
leave
you
free
to
return
to
niccoluccio

the

he
returned

niccoluccio
received
them
with
the

eagerness
so
much
the

rejoiced
as
he
was
the
farther
removed
from
hope
thereof
and
thanked
messer
gentile
as
best
he
might
and
knew
whilst
the
others
who
all
wept
for
compassion
commended
the
latter
amain
of
this
yea
and
he
was
commended
of
whosoever
heard
it
the
lady

received
in
her
house
with
marvellous
rejoicing
and
long
beheld
with
amazement
by
the
bolognese
as
one
raised
from

what

will
you

of

think
you
a

an
having
without

himself
reconciled
an

proffered
his
weasand

to
be
evened

this
deed

messer

young
and
ardent

had
a
just
title

that
which
the
heedlessness

dames
none
can
with

deny
that
messer
gentile
wrought
magnificently
but
if
it
be
sought
to
say
that
his
magnanimity
might
not
be
overpassed
it
will
not
belike
be
uneath
to
show
that
more
is
possible
as
i
purpose
to
set
out
to
you
in
a
little
story
of
mine
in
friuli
a
country
though
cold
glad
with
goodly
mountains
and
store
of
rivers
and
clear
springs
is
a
city
called
udine
wherein
was
aforetime
a
fair
and
noble
lady
called
madam
dianora
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
gentleman
named
gilberto
who
was
very
debonair
and
easy
of
composition
the
lady
charm
procured
her
to
be
passionately
loved
of
a
noble
and
great
baron
by
name
messer
ansaldo
gradense
a
man
of
high
condition
and
everywhere
renowned
for
prowess
and
courtesy
he
loved
her
fervently
and
did
all
that
lay
in
his
power
to
be
beloved
of
her
to
which
end
he
frequently
solicited
her
with
messages
but
wearied
himself
in
vain
at
last
his
importunities
being
irksome
to
the
lady
and
she
seeing
that
for
all
she
denied
him
everything
he
sought
of
her
he
stinted
not
therefor
to
love
and
solicit
her
she
determined
to
seek
to
rid
herself
of
him
by
means
of
an
extraordinary
and
in
her
judgment
an
impossible
demand
wherefore
she
said
one
day
to
a
woman
who
came
often
to
her
on
his
part
woman
thou
hast
many
times
avouched
to
me
that
messer
ansaldo
loveth
me
over
all
things
and
hast
proffered
me
marvellous
great
gifts
on
his
part
which
i
would
have
him
keep
to
himself
seeing
that
never
thereby
might
i
be
prevailed
upon
to
love
him
or
comply
with
his
wishes
but
an
i
could
be
certified
that
he
loveth
me
in
very
deed
as
much
as
thou
sayest
i
might
doubtless
bring
myself
to
love
him
and
do
that
which
he
willeth
wherefore
an
he
choose
to
certify
me
of
this
with
that
which
i
shall
require
of
him
i
shall
be
ready
to
do
his
commandments
quoth
the
good
woman
what
is
that
madam
which
you
would
have
him
do
which
i
desire
replied
the
lady
this
i
will
have
for
this
coming
month
of
january
a
garden
near
this
city
full
of
green
grass
and
flowers
and
trees
in
full
leaf
no
otherwise
than
as
it
were
may
the
which
if
he
contrive
not
let
him
never
more
send
me
thee
nor
any
other
for
that
an
he
importune
me
more
so
surely
as
i
have
hitherto
kept
his
pursuit
hidden
from
my
husband
and
my
kinsfolk
i
will
study
to
rid
myself
of
him
by
complaining
to
them
the
gentleman
hearing
the
demand
and
the
offer
of
his
mistress
for
all
it
seemed
to
him
a
hard
thing
and
in
a
manner
impossible
to
do
and
he
knew
it
to
be
required
of
the
lady
for
none
otherwhat
than
to
bereave
him
of
all
hope
determined
nevertheless
to
essay
whatsoever
might
be
done
thereof
and
sent
into
various
parts
about
the
world
enquiring
if
there
were
any
to
be
found
who
would
give
him
aid
and
counsel
in
the
matter
at
last
he
happened
upon
one
who
offered
so
he
were
well
guerdoned
to
do
the
thing
by
nigromantic
art
and
having
agreed
with
him
for
a
great
sum
of
money
he
joyfully
awaited
the
appointed
time
which
come
and
the
cold
being
extreme
and
everything
full
of
snow
and
ice
the
learned
man
the
night
before
the
calends
of
january
so
wrought
by
his
arts
in
a
very
goodly
meadow
adjoining
the
city
that
it
appeared
in
the
morning
according
to
the
testimony
of
those
who
saw
it
one
of
the
goodliest
gardens
was
ever
seen
of
any
with
grass
and
trees
and
fruits
of
every
kind
messer
ansaldo
after
viewing
this
with
the
utmost
gladness
let
cull
of
the
finest
fruits
and
the
fairest
flowers
that
were
there
and
caused
privily
present
them
to
his
mistress
bidding
her
come
and
see
the
garden
required
by
her
so
thereby
she
might
know
how
he
loved
her
and
after
remembering
her
of
the
promise
made
him
and
sealed
with
an
oath
bethink
herself
as
a
loyal
lady
to
accomplish
it
to
him
the
lady
seeing
the
fruits
and
flowers
and
having
already
from
many
heard
tell
of
the
miraculous
garden
began
to
repent
of
her
promise
natheless
curious
for
all
her
repentance
of
seeing
strange
things
she
went
with
many
other
ladies
of
the
city
to
view
the
garden
and
having
with
no
little
wonderment
commended
it
amain
returned
home
the
woefullest
woman
alive
bethinking
her
of
that
to
which
she
was
bounden
thereby
such
was
her
chagrin
that
she
availed
not
so
well
to
dissemble
it
but
needs
must
it
appear
and
her
husband
perceiving
it
was
urgent
to
know
the
reason
the
lady
for
shamefastness
kept
silence
thereof
a
great
while
but
at
last
constrained
to
speak
she
orderly
discovered
to
him
everything
which
gilberto
hearing
was
at
the
first
sore
incensed
but
presently
considering
the
purity
of
the
lady
intent
and
chasing
away
anger
with
better
counsel
he
said
it
is
not
the
part
of
a
discreet
nor
of
a
virtuous
woman
to
give
ear
unto
any
message
of
this
sort
nor
to
compound
with
any
for
her
chastity
under
whatsoever
condition
words
received
into
the
heart
by
the
channel
of
the
ears
have
more
potency
than
many
conceive
and
well
nigh
every
thing
becometh
possible
to
lovers
thou
didst
ill
then
first
to
hearken
and
after
to
enter
into
terms
of
composition
but
for
that
i
know
the
purity
of
thine
intent
i
will
to
absolve
thee
of
the
bond
of
the
promise
concede
thee
that
which
peradventure
none
other
would
do
being
thereto
the
more
induced
by
fear
of
the
nigromancer
whom
messer
ansaldo
an
thou
cheat
him
will
maybe
cause
make
us
woeful
i
will
then
that
thou
go
to
him
and
study
to
have
thyself
absolved
of
this
thy
promise
preserving
thy
chastity
if
thou
mayst
anywise
contrive
it
but
an
it
may
not
be
otherwise
thou
shalt
for
this
once
yield
him
thy
body
but
not
thy
soul
the
lady
hearing
her
husband
speech
wept
and
denied
herself
willing
to
receive
such
a
favour
from
him
but
for
all
her
much
denial
he
would
have
it
be
so
accordingly
next
morning
at
daybreak
the
lady
without
overmuch
adorning
herself
repaired
to
messer
ansaldo
house
with
two
of
her
before
and
a
chamberwoman
after
her
ansaldo
hearing
that
his
mistress
was
come
to
him
marvelled
sore
and
letting
call
the
nigromancer
said
to
him
will
have
thee
see
what
a
treasure
thy
skill
hath
gotten
me
then
going
to
meet
her
he
received
her
with
decency
and
reverence
without
ensuing
any
disorderly
appetite
and
they
entered
all
into
a
goodly
chamber
wherein
was
a
great
fire
there
he
caused
set
her
a
seat
and
said
i
prithee
if
the
long
love
i
have
borne
you
merit
any
recompense
let
it
not
irk
you
to
discover
to
me
the
true
cause
which
hath
brought
you
hither
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
company
the
lady
shamefast
and
well
nigh
with
tears
in
her
eyes
answered
neither
love
that
i
bear
you
nor
plighted
faith
bringeth
me
hither
but
the
commandment
of
my
husband
who
having
more
regard
to
the
travails
of
your
disorderly
passion
than
to
his
honour
and
mine
own
hath
caused
me
come
hither
and
by
his
behest
i
am
for
this
once
disposed
to
do
your
every
pleasure
if
messer
ansaldo
had
marvelled
at
the
sight
of
the
lady
far
more
did
he
marvel
when
he
heard
her
words
and
moved
by
gilberto
generosity
his
heat
began
to
change
to
compassion
and
he
said
forbid
madam
an
it
be
as
you
say
that
i
should
be
a
marrer
of
his
honour
who
hath
compassion
of
my
love
wherefore
you
shall
what
while
it
is
your
pleasure
to
abide
here
be
no
otherwise
entreated
than
as
you
were
my
sister
and
whenas
it
shall
be
agreeable
to
you
you
are
free
to
depart
so
but
you
will
render
your
husband
on
my
part
those
thanks
which
you
shall
deem
befitting
unto
courtesy
such
as
his
hath
been
and
have
me
ever
in
time
to
come
for
brother
and
for
servant
footnote
ansaldo
dianora
and
the
nigromancer
the
lady
hearing
these
words
was
the
joyfullest
woman
in
the
world
and
answered
saying
having
regard
to
your
fashions
could
ever
make
me
believe
that
aught
should
ensue
to
me
of
my
coming
other
than
this
that
i
see
you
do
in
the
matter
whereof
i
shall
still
be
beholden
to
you
then
taking
leave
she
returned
under
honourable
escort
to
messer
gilberto
and
told
him
that
which
had
passed
of
which
there
came

entered

upon

garment
of

white
as

which
from

was

a

seeing
them
marvelled
and
in

came
forward
modestly
and

themselves

one
of

deftly
kindled
fire
under

with

whereas
she
knew
the
fish
lay
hid
and
the
other
standing
ready
with
the
net
in
a
short
space
of
time
took
fish

to
the

pleasure
of

eyed

attently

throwing
some
thereof
to

put
them
in

proceeded
as

had
been
lessoned
to
take
of
the
finest
and
cast
them
on
the
table
before
the
king

the
fish
wriggled
about
the
table
to
the
marvellous
diversion
of
the
king
who
took
of
them
in
his
turn
and
sportively
cast
them
back
to
the
damsels
and
on
this
wise
they
frolicked
awhile
till
such
time
as
the
servant
had
cooked
the
fish
which
had
been
given
him
and
which
messer
neri
having
so
ordered
it
were
now
set
before
the

as
a
relish

as

cooked

taken
enough
came

thin

clinging
to

before
the

returned
to
the
house
the
latter
and
the
count
and
the
others
who
served
had
well
considered
the
damsels
and
each
inwardly
greatly
commended
them
for
fair
and
well
shapen
no
less
than
for
agreeable
and
well
mannered
but
above
all
they
pleased
the
king
who
had
so
intently
eyed
every
part
of
their
bodies
as
they
came
forth
of
the
water
that
had
any
then
pricked
him
he
would
not
have
felt
it
and
as
he
called
them
more
particularly
to
mind
unknowing
who
they
were
he
felt
a
very
fervent
desire
awaken
in
his
heart
to
please
them
whereby
he
right
well
perceived
himself
to
be
in
danger
of
becoming
enamoured
an
he
took
no
heed
to
himself
thereagainst
nor
knew
he
indeed
whether
of
the
twain
it
was
the
more
pleased
him
so
like
in
all
things
was
the
one
to
the
other
after
he
had
abidden
awhile
in
this
thought
he
turned
to
messer
neri
and
asked
him
who
were
the
two
damsels
to
which
the
gentleman
answered
lord
these
are
my
daughters
born
at
a
birth
whereof
the
one
is
called
ginevra
the
fair
and
the
other
isotta
the
blonde
the
king
commended
them
greatly
and
exhorted
him
to
marry
them
whereof
messer
neri
excused
himself
for
that
he
was
no
more
able
thereunto
meanwhile
nothing
now
remaining
to
be
served
of
the
supper
but
the
fruits
there
came
the
two
damsels
in
very
goodly
gowns
of
sendal
with
two
great
silver
platters
in
their
hands
full
of
various
fruits
such
as
the
season
afforded
and
these
they
set
on
the
table
before
the
king
which
done
they
withdrew
a
little
apart
and
fell
to
singing
a
canzonet
whereof
the
words
began
thus
whereas
i
come
o
love
it
might
not
be
indeed
at
length
recounted
etc
this
song
they
carolled
on
such
dulcet
wise
and
so
delightsomely
that
to
the
king
who
beheld
and
hearkened
to
them
with
ravishment
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
hierarchies
of
the
angels
were
lighted
there
to
sing
the
song
sung
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
respectfully
craved
of
him
leave
to
depart
who
albeit
their
departure
was
grievous
to
him
yet
with
a
show
of
blitheness
accorded
it
to
them
the
supper
being
now
at
an
end
the
king
remounted
to
horse
with
his
company
and
leaving
messer
neri
returned
to
the
royal
lodging
devising
of
one
thing
and
another
there
holding
his
passion
hidden
but
availing
not
for
whatsoever
great
affair
might
supervene
to
forget
the
beauty
and
grace
of
ginevra
the
fair
for
love
of
whom
he
loved
her
sister
also
who
was
like
unto
her
he
became
so
fast
entangled
in
the
amorous
snares
that
he
could
think
of
well
nigh
nought
else
and
feigning
other
occasions
kept
a
strait
intimacy
with
messer
neri
and
very
often
visited
his
fair
garden
to
see
ginevra
at
last
unable
to
endure
longer
and
bethinking
himself
in
default
of
other
means
of
compassing
his
desire
to
take
not
one
alone
but
both
of
the
damsels
from
their
father
he
discovered
both
his
passion
and
his
intent
to
count
guy
who
for
that
he
was
an
honourable
man
said
to
him
lord
i
marvel
greatly
at
that
which
you
tell
me
and
that
more
than
would
another
inasmuch
as
meseemeth
i
have
from
your
childhood
to
this
day
known
your
fashions
better
than
any
other
wherefore
meseeming
never
to
have
known
such
a
passion
in
your
youth
wherein
love
might
lightlier
have
fixed
his
talons
and
seeing
you
presently
hard
upon
old
age
it
is
so
new
and
so
strange
to
me
that
you
should
love
by
way
of
enamourment
that
it
seemeth
to
me
well
nigh
a
miracle
and
were
it
my
office
to
reprove
you
thereof
i
know
well
that
which
i
should
say
to
you
thereanent
having
in
regard
that
you
are
yet
with
your
harness
on
your
back
in
a
kingdom
newly
gained
amidst
a
people
unknown
and
full
of
wiles
and
treasons
and
are
all
occupied
with
very
grave
cares
and
matters
of
high
moment
nor
have
you
yet
availed
to
seat
yourself
in
security
and
yet
among
such
and
so
many
affairs
you
have
made
place
for
the
allurements
of
love
this
is
not
the
fashion
of
a
magnanimous
king
nay
but
rather
that
of
a
pusillanimous
boy
moreover
what
is
far
worse
you
say
that
you
are
resolved
to
take
his
two
daughters
from
a
gentleman
who
hath
entertained
you
in
his
house
beyond
his
means
and
who
to
do
you
the
more
honour
hath
shown
you
these
twain
in
a
manner
naked
thereby
attesting
how
great
is
the
faith
he
hath
in
you
and
that
he
firmly
believeth
you
to
be
a
king
and
not
a
ravening
wolf
again
hath
it
so
soon
dropped
your
memory
that
it
was
the
violences
done
of
manfred
to
women
that
opened
you
the
entry
into
this
kingdom
what
treason
was
ever
wroughten
more
deserving
of

punishment

this
would
be
that

they
may
let

tell
you

it
was
an
exceedingly
great
glory
to
you
to
have
overcome
manfred

a
far
greater
one
it
is
to
overcome
one
self
wherefore
do
you

have
to
correct

conquer
yourself

borne
him
by
lisa
comforteth
the
maid
and
presently
marrieth
her
to
a
noble
young
gentleman
then
kissing
her
on
the
brow
he
ever
after
avoucheth
himself
her
knight
fiammetta
having
made
an
end
of
her
story
and
the
manful
magnanimity
of
king
charles
having
been
much
commended
albeit
there
was
one
lady
there
who
being
a
ghibelline
was
loath
to
praise
him
pampinea
by
the
king
commandment
began
thus
there
is
no
one
of
understanding
worshipful
ladies
but
would
say
that
which
you
say
of
good
king
charles
except
she
bear
him
for
otherwhat
but
for
that
there
occurreth
to
my
memory
a
thing
belike
no
less
commendable
than
this
done
of
one
his
adversary
to
one
of
our
florentine
damsels
it
pleaseth
me
to
relate
it
to
you
at
the
time
of
the
expulsion
of
the
french
from
sicily
one
of
our
florentines
was
an
apothecary
at
palermo
a
very
rich
man
called
bernardo
puccini
who
had
by
his
wife
an
only
daughter
a
very
fair
damsel
and
already
apt
for
marriage
now
king
pedro
of
arragon
become
lord
of
the
island
held
high
festival
with
his
barons
at
palermo
wherein
he
tilting
after
the
catalan
fashion
it
chanced
that
bernardo
daughter
whose
name
was
lisa
saw
him
running
at
the
ring
from
a
window
where
she
was
with
other
ladies
and
he
so
marvellously
pleased
her
that
looking
upon
him
once
and
again
she
fell
passionately
in
love
with
him
and
the
festival
ended
and
she
abiding
in
her
father
house
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
of
this
her
illustrious
and
exalted
love
and
what
most
irked
her
in
this
was
the
consciousness
of
her
own
mean
condition
which
scarce
suffered
her
to
cherish
any
hope
of
a
happy
issue
natheless
she
could
not
therefor
bring
herself
to
leave
loving
the
king
albeit
for
fear
of
greater
annoy
she
dared
not
discover
her
passion
the
king
had
not
perceived
this
thing
and
recked
not
of
her
wherefor
she
suffered
intolerable
chagrin
past
all
that
can
be
imagined
thus
it
befell
that
love
still
waxing
in
her
and
melancholy
redoubling
upon
melancholy
the
fair
maid
unable
to
endure
more
fell
sick
and
wasted
visibly
away
from
day
to
day
like
snow
in
the
sun
her
father
and
mother
sore
concerned
for
this
that
befell
her
studied
with
assiduous
tenderness
to
hearten
her
and
succoured
her
in
as
much
as
might
be
with
physicians
and
medicines
but
it
availed
nothing
for
that
despairing
of
her
love
she
had
elected
to
live
no
longer
it
chanced
one
day
that
her
father
offering
to
do
her
every
pleasure
she
bethought
herself
and
she
might
aptly
to
seek
before
she
died
to
make
the
king
acquainted
with
her
love
and
her
intent
and
accordingly
she
prayed
him
bring
her
minuccio
now
this
minuccio
was
in
those
days
held
a
very
quaint
and
subtle
singer
and
player
and
was
gladly
seen
of
the
king
and
bernardo
concluded
that
lisa
had
a
mind
to
hear
him
sing
and
play
awhile
accordingly
he
sent
to
tell
him
and
minuccio
who
was
a
man
of
a
debonair
humour
incontinent
came
to
her
and
having
somedele
comforted
her
with
kindly
speech
softly
played
her
a
fit
or
two
on
a
viol
he
had
with
him
and
after
sang
her
sundry
songs
the
which
were
fire
and
flame
unto
the
damsel
passion
whereas
he
thought
to
solace
her
presently
she
told
him
that
she
would
fain
speak
some
words
with
him
alone
wherefore
all
else
having
withdrawn
she
said
to
him
i
have
chosen
thee
to
keep
me
very
faithfully
a
secret
of
mine
hoping
in
the
first
place
that
thou
wilt
never
discover
it
to
any
one
save
to
him
of
whom
i
shall
tell
thee
and
after
that
thou
wilt
help
me
in
that
which
lieth
in
thy
power
and
of
this
i
pray
thee
thou
must
know
then
minuccio
mine
that
the
day
our
lord
king
pedro
held
the
great
festival
in
honour
of
his
exaltation
to
the
throne
it
befell
me
as
he
tilted
to
espy
him
at
so
dour
a
point
that
for
the
love
of
him
there
was
kindled
in
my
heart
a
fire
that
hath
brought
me
to
this
pass
wherein
thou
seest
me
and
knowing
how
ill
my
love
beseemeth
to
a
king
yet
availing
not
let
alone
to
drive
it
away
but
even
to
abate
it
and
it
being
beyond
measure
grievous
to
me
to
bear
i
have
as
a
lesser
evil
elected
to
die
as
i
shall
do
true
it
is
that
i
should
begone
hence
cruelly
disconsolate
an
he
first
knew
it
not
wherefore
unknowing
by
whom
i
could
more
aptly
acquaint
him
with
this
my
resolution
than
by
thyself
i
desire
to
commit
it
to
thee
and
pray
thee
that
thou
refuse
not
to
do
it
and
whenas
thou
shalt
have
done
it
that
thou
give
me
to
know
thereof
so
that
dying
comforted
i
may
be
assoiled
of
these
my
pains
and
this
said
she
stinted
weeping
footnote
si
forte
or
in
modern
parlance
at
so
critical
or
a
moment
minuccio
marvelled
at
the
greatness
of
the
damsel
soul
and
at
her
cruel
resolve
and
was
sore
concerned
for
her
then
it
suddenly
occurring
to
his
mind
how
he
might
honourably
oblige
her
he
said
to
her
i
pledge
thee
my
faith
whereof
thou
mayst
live
assured
that
thou
wilt
never
find
thyself
deceived
and
after
commending
thee
of
so
high
an

as
it
is
to
have
set
thy

great
a

thee

about
it

lisa
having
anew
besought
him
amain
thereof
and
promised
him
to
take
comfort
bade
him
god
speed
whereupon
minuccio
taking
his
leave
betook
himself
to
one
mico
da
siena
a
mighty
good
rhymer
of
those
days
and
constrained
him
with
prayers
to
make
the

get
thee
to

my

hath
inflamed
so
sadly

for
the
fire
wherewith
i
all
aglow
i
fear
to
die
nor
yet
the
hour
can
tell
when
i
shall
part
from

and

i
dree
in
shame
and
fear
ah
me
for

cause
him

my

him
i
grew
thou
hast
not
given
me
the

to
dare
so
much
as
one
poor

my
lord
unto
my

and
longing
plainly
to
declare
my
lord
who
maketh
me
so
sore
to

thus
were
hard
to
me
to

indeed
for
he
is
debonair
not
displease
him
did
he
know
what
pain
i
feel
and
didst
thou
deign
me
daring
to
make
known
to
him
my
fire
yet
since
was
not
thy
pleasure
to
impart
love
such
assurance
to
me
that
by
glance
or
sign
or
writ
i
might
make
known
my

unto
my
lord
for
my
deliverance
i
prithee
sweet
my
master
of
thine

get
thee
to
him
and
give
him
souvenance
of
that
fair
day
i
saw
him
shield
and
lance
bear
with
the
other
knights
and
looking
more
enamoured
fell
so
sore
my
heart
thereof
doth
perish
and
expire
these
words
minuccio
forthwith
set
to
a
soft
and
plaintive
air
such
as
the
matter
thereof
required
and
on
the
third
day
he
betook
himself
to
court
where
king
pedro
being
yet
at
meat
he
was
bidden
by
him
sing
somewhat
to
his
viol
thereupon
he
fell
to
singing
the
song
aforesaid
on
such
dulcet
wise
that
all
who
were
in
the
royal
hall
appeared
men
astonied
so
still
and
attent
stood
they
all
to
hearken
and
the
king
maybe
more
than
the
others
minuccio
having
made
an
end
of
his
singing
the
king
enquired
whence
came
this
song
that
himseemed
he
had
never
before
heard
lord
replied
the
minstrel
is
not
yet
three
days
since
the
words
were
made
and
the
air
the
king
asked
for
whom
it
had
been
made
and
minuccio
answered
dare
not
discover
it
save
to
you
alone
the
king
desirous
to
hear
it
as
soon
as
the
tables
were
removed
sent
for
minuccio
into
his
chamber
and
the
latter
orderly
recounted
to
him
all
that
he
had
heard
from
lisa
wherewith
don
pedro
was
exceeding
well
pleased
and
much
commended
the
damsel
avouching
himself
resolved
to
have
compassion
of
so
worthful
a
young
lady
and
bidding
him
therefore
go
comfort
her
on
his
part
and
tell
her
that
he
would
without
fail
come
to
visit
her
that
day
towards
vespers
minuccio
overjoyed
to
be
the
bearer
of
such
pleasing
news
betook
himself
incontinent
viol
and
all
to
the
damsel
and
bespeaking
her
in
private
recounted
to
her
all
that
had
passed
and
after
sang
her
the
song
to
his
viol
whereat
she
was
so
rejoiced
and
so
content
that
she
straightway
showed
manifest
signs
of
great
amendment
and
longingly
awaited
the
hour
of
vespers
whenas
her
lord
should
come
without
any
of
the
household
knowing
or
guessing
how
the
case
stood
meanwhile
the
king
who
was
a
debonair
and
generous
prince
having
sundry
times
taken
thought
to
the
things
heard
from
minuccio
and
very
well
knowing
the
damsel
and
her
beauty
waxed
yet
more
pitiful
over
her
and
mounting
to
horse
towards
vespers
under
colour
of
going
abroad
for
his
diversion
betook
himself
to
the
apothecary
house
where
having
required
a
very
goodly
garden
which
he
had
to
be
opened
to
him
he
alighted
therein
and
presently
asked
bernardo
what
was
come
of
his
daughter
and
if
he
had
yet
married
her
lord
replied
the
apothecary
is
not
married
nay
she
hath
been
and
is
yet
very
sick
albeit
it
is
true
that
since
none
she
hath
mended
marvellously
the
king
readily
apprehended
what
this
amendment
meant
and
said
good
sooth
pity
so
fair
a
creature
should
be
yet
taken
from
the
world
we
would
fain
go
visit
her
accordingly
a
little
after
he
betook
himself
with
bernardo
and
two
companions
only
to
her
chamber
and
going
up
to
the
bed
where
the
damsel
somedele
upraised
awaited
him
with
impatience
took
her
by
the
hand
and
said
to
her
meaneth
this
my
mistress
you
are
young
and
should
comfort
other
women
yet
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
sick
we
would
beseech
you
be
pleased
for
the
love
of
us
to
hearten
yourself
on
such
wise
that
you
may
speedily
be
whole
again
the
damsel
feeling
herself
touched
of
his
hands
whom
she
loved
over
all
else
albeit
she
was
somewhat
shamefast
felt
yet
such
gladness
in
her
heart
as
she
were
in
paradise
and
answered
him
as
best
she
might
saying
lord
my
having
willed
to
subject
my
little
strength
unto
very
grievous
burdens
hath
been
the
cause
to
me
of
this
mine
infirmity
whereof
thanks
to
your
goodness
you
shall
soon
see
me
quit
the
king
alone
understood
the
damsel
covert
speech
and
held
her
momently
of
more
account
nay
sundry
whiles
he
inwardly
cursed
fortune
who
had
made
her
daughter
unto
such
a
man
then
after
he
had
tarried
with
her
awhile
and
comforted
her
yet
more
he
took
his
leave
footnote
syn
solaced
relieved
or
agitated
troubled
this
humanity
of
the
king
was
greatly
commended
and
attributed
for
great
honour
to
the
apothecary
and
his
daughter
which
latter
abode
as
well
pleased
as
ever
was
woman
of
her
lover
and
sustained
of
better
hope
in
a
few
days
recovered
and
became
fairer
than
ever
when
she
was
whole
again
the
king
having
taken
counsel
with
the
queen
of
what
return
he
should
make
her
for
so
much
love
mounting
one
day
to
horse
with
many
of
his
barons
repaired
to
the
apothecary
house
and
entering
the
garden
let
call
master
bernardo
and
his
daughter
then
the
queen
presently
coming
thither
with
many
ladies
and
having
received
lisa
among
them
they
fell
to
making
after
a
while
the
king
and
queen
called
lisa
to
them
and
the
former
said
to
her
damsel
the
much
love
you
have
borne
us
hath
gotten
you
a
great
honour
from
us
wherewith
we
would
have
you
for
the
love
of
us
be
content
to
wit
that
since
you
are
apt
for
marriage
we
would
have
you
take
him
to
husband
whom
we
shall
bestow
on
you
purposing
notwithstanding
this
to
call
ourselves
still
your
knight
without
desiring
aught
from
you
of
so
much
love
but
one
sole
kiss
the
damsel
grown
all
vermeil
in
the
face
for
shamefastness
making
the
king
pleasure
hers
replied
in
a
low
voice
on
this
wise
lord
i
am
well
assured
that
were
it
known
that
i
had
fallen
enamoured
of
you
most
folk
would
account
me
mad
therefor
thinking
belike
that
i
had
forgotten
myself
and
knew
not
mine
own
condition
nor
yet
yours
but
god
who
alone
seeth
the
hearts
of
mortals
knoweth
that
in
that
same
hour
whenas
first
you
pleased
me
i
knew
you
for
a
king
and
myself
for
the
daughter
of
bernardo
the
apothecary
and
that
it
ill
beseemed
me
to
address
the
ardour
of
my
soul
unto
so
high
a
place
but
as
you
know
far
better
than
i
none
here
below
falleth
in
love
according
to
fitness
of
election
but
according
to
appetite
and
inclination
against
which
law
i
once
and
again
strove
with
all
my
might
till
availing
no
farther
i
loved
and
love
and
shall
ever
love
you
but
since
first
i
felt
myself
taken
with
love
of
you
i
determined
still
to
make
your
will
mine
wherefore
not
only
will
i
gladly
obey
you
in
this
matter
of
taking
a
husband
at
your
hands
and
holding
him
dear
whom
it
shall
please
you
to
bestow
on
me
since
that
will
be
mine
honour
and
estate
but
should
you
bid
me
abide
in
the
fire
it
were
a
delight
to
me
an
i
thought
thereby
to
pleasure
you
to
have
you
a
king
to
knight
you
know
how
far
it
befitteth
me
wherefore
to
that
i
make
no
farther
answer
nor
shall
the
kiss
be
vouchsafed
you
which
alone
of
my
love
you
would
have
without
leave
of
my
lady
the
queen
natheless
of
such
graciousness
as
hath
been
yours
towards
me
and
that
of
our
lady
the
queen
here
god
render
you
for
me
both
thanks
and
recompense
for
i
have
not
the
wherewithal
and
with
that
she
was
silent
her
answer
much
pleased
the
queen
and
she
seemed
to
her
as
discreet
as
the
king
had
reported
her
don
pedro
then
let
call
the
girl
father
and
mother
and
finding
that
they
were
well
pleased
with
that
which
he
purposed
to
do
summoned
a
young
man
by
name
perdicone
who
was
of
gentle
birth
but
poor
and
giving
certain
rings
into
his
hand
married
him
nothing
loath
to
lisa
which
done
he
then
and
there
over
and
above
many
and
precious
jewels
bestowed
by
the
queen
and
himself
upon
the
damsel
gave
him
ceffalu
and
calatabellotta
two
very
rich
and
goodly
fiefs
and
said
to
him
we
give
thee
to
the
lady
dowry
that
which
we
purpose
to
do
for
thyself
thou
shalt
see
in
time
to
come
this
said
he
turned
to
the
damsel
and
saying
will
we
take
that
fruit
which
we
are
to
have
of
your
love
took
her
head
in
his

commended
of

and
i
purpose
accordingly
to
recount
to
you
in
a
story
the
praiseworthy
and
magnanimous
dealings
of
two
citizens
and
friends
with
each
other
you
must
know
then
that
at
the
time
when
octavianus
c√¶sar
not
yet
styled
augustus
ruled
the
roman
empire
in
the
office
called
triumvirate
there
was
in
rome
a
gentleman
called
publius
quintius
fulvus
who
having
a
son
of
marvellous
understanding
by
name
titus
quintius
fulvus
sent
him
to
athens
to
study
philosophy
and
commended
him
as
most
he
might
to
a
nobleman
there
called
chremes
his
very
old
friend
by
whom
titus
was
lodged
in
his
own
house
in
company
of
a
son
of
his
called
gisippus
and
set
to
study
with
the
latter
under
the
governance
of
a
philosopher
named
aristippus
the
two
young
men
coming
to
consort
together
found
each
other
usances
so
conformable
that
there
was
born
thereof
a
brotherhood
between
them
and
a
friendship
so
great
that
it
was
never
sundered
by
other
accident
than
death
and
neither
of
them
knew
weal
nor
peace
save
in
so
much
as
they
were
together
entering
upon
their
studies
and
being
each
alike
endowed
with
the
highest
understanding
they
ascended
with
equal
step
and
marvellous
commendation
to
the
glorious
altitudes
of
philosophy
and
in
this
way
of
life
they
continued
good
three
years
to
the
exceeding
contentment
of
chremes
who
in
a
manner
looked
upon
the
one
as
no
more
his
son
than
the
other
at
the
end
of
this
time
it
befell
even
as
it
befalleth
of
all
things
that
chremes
now
an
old
man
departed
this
life
whereof
the
two
young
men
suffered
a
like
sorrow
as
for
a
common
father
nor
could
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
discern
which
of
the
twain
was
the
more
in
need
of
consolation
for
that
which
had
betided
them
footnote
sic
quinzio
but
should
it
not
rather
be
quinto
publius
quintus
fulvius
a
form
of
the
name
which
seems
more
in
accordance
with
the
genius
of
the
latin
language
it
came
to
pass
after
some
months
that
the
friends
and
kinsfolk
of
gisippus
resorted
to
him
and
together
with
titus
exhorted
him
to
take
a
wife
to
which
he
consenting
they
found
him
a
young
athenian
lady
of
marvellous
beauty
and
very
noble
parentage
whose
name
was
sophronia
and
who
was
maybe
fifteen
years
old
the
term
of
the
future
nuptials
drawing
nigh
gisippus
one
day
besought
titus
to
go
visit
her
with
him
for
that
he
had
not
yet
seen
her
accordingly
they
being
come
into
her
house
and
she
seated
between
the
twain
titus
proceeded
to
consider
her
with
the
utmost
attention
as
if
to
judge
of
the
beauty
of
his
friend
bride
and
every
part
of
her
pleasing
him
beyond
measure
what
while
he
inwardly
commended
her
charms
to
the
utmost
he
fell
without
showing
any
sign
thereof
as
passionately
enamoured
of
her
as
ever
yet
man
of
woman
after
they
had
been
with
her
awhile
they
took
their
leave
and
returned
home
where
titus
betaking
himself
alone
into
his
chamber
fell
of
the
charming
damsel
and
grew
the
more
enkindled
the
more
he
enlarged
upon
her
in
thought
which
perceiving
he
fell
to
saying
in
himself
after
many
ardent
sighs
the
wretchedness
of
thy
life
titus
where
and
on
what
settest
thou
thy
mind
and
thy
love
and
thy
hope
knowest
thou
not
that
it
behoveth
thee
as
well
for
the
kindness
received
from
chremes
and
his
family
as
for
the
entire
friendship
that
is
between
thee
and
gisippus
whose
bride
she
is
to
have
yonder
damsel
in
such
respect
as
a
sister
whom
then
lovest
thou
whither
lettest
thou
thyself
be
carried
away
by
delusive
love
whither
by
fallacious
hope
open
the
eyes
of
thine
understanding
and
recollect
thyself
wretch
that
thou
art
give
place
to
reason
curb
thy
carnal
appetite
temper
thine
unhallowed
desires
and
direct
thy
thoughts
unto
otherwhat
gainstand
thy
lust
in
this
its
beginning
and
conquer
thyself
whilst
it
is
yet
time
this
thou
wouldst
have
is
unseemly
nay
it
is
dishonourable
this
thou
art
minded
to
ensue
it
behoveth
thee
even
wert
thou
assured
which
thou
art
not
of
obtaining
it
to
flee
from
an
thou
have
regard
unto
that
which
true
friendship
requireth
and
that
which
thou
oughtest
what
then
wilt
thou
do
titus
thou
wilt
leave
this
unseemly
love
an
thou
wouldst
do
that
which
behoveth
then
remembering
him
of
sophronia
and
going
over
to
the
contrary
he
denounced
all
that
he
had
said
saying
laws
of
love
are
of
greater
puissance
than
any
others
they
annul
even
the
divine
laws
let
alone
those
of
friendship
how
often
aforetime
hath
father
loved
daughter
brother
sister
stepmother
stepson
things
more
monstrous
than
for
one
friend
to
love
the
other
wife
the
which
hath
already
a
thousand
times
befallen
moreover
i
am
young
and
youth
is
altogether
subject
to
the
laws
of
love
wherefor
that
which
pleaseth
him
needs
must
it
please
me
things
honourable
pertain
unto
maturer
folk
i
can
will
nought
save
that
which
love
willeth
the
beauty
of
yonder
damsel
deserveth
to
be
loved
of
all
and
if
i
love
her
who
am
young
who
can
justly
blame
me
therefor
i
love
her
not
because
she
is
gisippus
nay
i
love
her
for
that
i
should
love
her
whosesoever
she
was
in
this
fortune
sinneth
that
hath
allotted
her
to
gisippus
my
friend
rather
than
to
another
and
if
she
must
be
loved
as
she
must
and
deservedly
for
her
beauty
gisippus
an
he
came
to
know
it
should
be
better
pleased
that
i
should
love
her
i
than
another
then
from
that
reasoning
he
reverted
again
to
the
contrary
making
mock
of
himself
and
wasted
not
only
that
day
and
the
ensuing
night
in
passing
from
this
to
that
and
back
again
but
many
others
insomuch
that
losing
appetite
and
sleep
therefor
he
was
constrained
for
weakness
to
take
to
his
bed
gisippus
having
beheld
him
several
days
full
of
melancholy
thought
and
seeing
him
presently
sick
was
sore
concerned
and
with
every
art
and
all
solicitude
studied
to
comfort
him
never
leaving
him
and
questioning
him
often
and
instantly
of
the
cause
of
his
melancholy
and
his
sickness
titus
after
having
once
and
again
given
him
idle
tales
which
gisippus
knew
to
be
such
by
way
of
answer
finding
himself
constrained
thereunto
with
tears
and
sighs
replied
to
him
on
this
wise
had
it
pleased
the
gods
death
were
far
more
to
me
than
to
live
longer
considering
that
fortune
hath
brought
me
to
a
pass
whereas
it
behoved
me
make
proof
of
my
virtue
and
that
i
have
to
my
exceeding
shame
found
this
latter
overcome
but
certes
i
look
thereof
to
have
ere
long
the
reward
that
befitteth
me
to
wit
death
and
this
will
be
more
pleasing
to
me
than
to
live
in
remembrance
of
my
baseness
which
latter
for
that
i
can
not
nor
should
hide
aught
from
thee
i
will
not
without
sore
blushing
discover
to
thee
then
beginning
from
the
beginning
he
discovered
to
him
the
cause
of
his
melancholy
and
the
conflict
of
his
thoughts
and
ultimately
gave
him
to
know
which
had
gotten
the
victory
and
confessed
himself
perishing
for
love
of
sophronia
declaring
that
knowing
how
much
this
misbeseemed
him
he
had
for
penance
thereof
resolved
himself
to
die
whereof
he
trusted
speedily
to
make
an
end
gisippus
hearing
this
and
seeing
his
tears
abode
awhile
irresolute
as
one
who
though
more
moderately
was
himself
taken
with
the
charms
of
the
fair
damsel
but
speedily
bethought
himself
that
his
life
should
be
dearer
to
him
than
sophronia
accordingly
solicited
to
tears
by
those
of
his
friend
he
answered
him
weeping
wert
thou
not
in
need
as
thou
art
of
comfort
i
should
complain
of
thee
to
thyself
as
of
one
who
hath
transgressed
against
our
friendship
in
having
so
long
kept
thy
most
grievous
passion
hidden
from
me
since
albeit
it
appeared
not
to
thee
honourable
nevertheless
dishonourable
things
should
not
more
than
honourable
be
hidden
from
a
friend
for
that
a
friend
like
as
he
rejoiceth
with
his
friend
in
honourable
things
even
so
he
studieth
to
do
away
the
dishonourable
from
his
friend
mind
but
for
the
present
i
will
refrain
therefrom
and
come
to
that
which
i
perceive
to
be
of
greater
urgency
that
thou
lovest
sophronia
who
is
betrothed
to
me
i
marvel
not
nay
i
should
marvel
indeed
if
it
were
not
so
knowing
her
beauty
and
the
nobility
of
thy
mind
so
much
the
more
susceptible
of
passion
as
the
thing
that
pleaseth
hath
the
more
excellence
and
the
more
reason
thou
hast
to
love
sophronia
so
much
the
more
unjustly
dost
thou
complain
of
fortune
albeit
thou
expressest
this
not
in
so
many
words
in
that
it
hath
awarded
her
to
me
it
seeming
to
thee
that
thy
love
for
her
had
been
honourable
were
she
other
than
mine
but
tell
me
if
thou
be
as
well
advised
as
thou
usest
to
be
to
whom
could
fortune
have
awarded
her
whereof
thou
shouldst
have
more
cause
to
render
it
thanks
than
of
having
awarded
her
to
me
whoso
else
had
had
her
how
honourable
soever
thy
love
had
been
had
liefer
loved
her
for
himself
than
for
thee
a
thing
which
thou
shouldst
not
fear
from
me
an
thou
hold
me
a
friend
such
as
i
am
to
thee
for
that
i
mind
me
not
since
we
have
been
friends
to
have
ever
had
aught
that
was
not
as
much
thine
as
mine
now
were
the
matter
so
far
advanced
that
it
might
not
be
otherwise
i
would
do
with
her
as
i
have
done
with
my
other
possessions
but
it
is
yet
at
such
a
point
that
i
can
make
her
thine
alone
and
i
will
do
so
for
that
i
know
not
why
my
friendship
should
be
dear
to
thee
if
in
respect
of
a
thing
that
may
honourably
be
done
i
knew
not
of
a
desire
of
mine
to
make
thine
true
it
is
that
sophronia
is
my
promised
bride
and
that
i
loved
her
much
and
looked
with
great
joyance
for
my
nuptials
with
her
but
since
thou
being
far
more
understanding
than
i
with
more
ardour
desirest
so
dear
a
thing
as
she
is
live
assured
that
she
shall
enter
my
chamber
not
as
my
wife
but
as
thine
wherefore
leave
put
away
melancholy
call
back
thy
lost
health
and
comfort
and
allegresse
and
from
this
time
forth
expect
with
blitheness
the
reward
of
thy
love
far
worthier
than
was
mine
footnote
or
his
footnote
or
thine
footnote
lit
hope
see
note
p
footnote
i
would
have
her
in
common
with
thee
when
titus
heard
gisippus
speak
thus
the
more
the
flattering
hopes
given
him
of
the
latter
afforded
him
pleasure
so
much
the
more
did
just
reason
inform
him
with
shame
showing
him
that
the
greater
was
gisippus
his
liberality
the
more
unworthy
it
appeared
of
himself
to
use
it
wherefore
without
giving
over
weeping
he
with
difficulty
replied
to
him
thus
thy
generous
and
true
friendship
very
plainly
showeth
me
that
which
it
pertaineth
unto
mine
to
do
god
forfend
that
her
whom
he
hath
bestowed
upon
thee
as
upon
the
worthier
i
should
receive
from
thee
for
mine
had
he
judged
it
fitting
that
she
should
be
mine
nor
thou
nor
others
can
believe
that
he
would
ever
have
bestowed
her
on
thee
use
therefore
joyfully
thine
election
and
discreet
counsel
and
his
gifts
and
leave
me
to
languish
in
the
tears
which
as
to
one
undeserving
of
such
a
treasure
he
hath
prepared
unto
me
and
which
i
will
either
overcome
and
that
will
be
dear
to
thee
or
they
will
overcome
me
and
i
shall
be
out
of
pain
rejoined
gisippus
our
friendship
might
accord
me
such
license
that
i
should
enforce
thee
to
ensue
a
desire
of
mine
and
if
it
may
avail
to
induce
thee
to
do
so
it
is
in
this
case
that
i
mean
to
use
it
to
the
utmost
and
if
thou
yield
not
to
my
prayers
with
a
good
grace
i
will
with
such
violence
as
it
behoveth
us
use
for
the
weal
of
our
friends
procure
that
sophronia
shall
be
thine
i
know
how
great
is
the
might
of
love
and
that
not
once
but
many
a
time
it
hath
brought
lovers
to
a
miserable
death
nay
unto
this
i
see
thee
so
near
that
thou
canst
neither
turn
back
nor
avail
to
master
thy
tears
but
proceeding
thus
wouldst
pine
and
die
whereupon
i
without
any
doubt
should
speedily
follow
after
if
then
i
loved
thee
not
for
otherwhat
thy
life
is
dear
to
me
so
i
myself
may
live
sophronia
therefore
shall
be
thine
for
that
thou
couldst
not
lightly
find
another
woman
who
would
so
please
thee
and
as
i
shall
easily
turn
my
love
unto
another
i
shall
thus
have
contented
both
thyself
and
me
i
should
not
peradventure
be
so
free
to
do
this
were
wives
as
scarce
and
as
uneath
to
find
as
friends
however
as
i
can
very
easily
find
me
another
wife
but
not
another
friend
i
had
liefer
i
will
not
say
her
for
that
i
shall
not
lose
her
giving
her
to
thee
but
shall
transfer
her
to
another
and
a
better
self
but
transfer
her
than
lose
thee
wherefore
if
my
prayers
avail
aught
with
thee
i
beseech
thee
put
away
from
thee
this
affliction
and
comforting
at
once
thyself
and
me
address
thee
with
good
hope
to
take
that
joyance
which
thy
fervent
love
desireth
of
the
thing
beloved
although
titus
was
ashamed
to
consent
to
this
namely
that
sophronia
should
become
his
wife
and
on
this
account
held
out
yet
awhile
nevertheless
love
on
the
one
hand
drawing
him
and
gisippus
his
exhortations
on
the
other
urging
him
he
said
you
gisippus
i
know
not
which
i
can
say
i
do
most
my
pleasure
or
thine
in
doing
that
whereof
thou
prayest
me
and
which
thou
tellest
me
is
so
pleasing
to
thee
and
since
thy
generosity
is
such
that
it
overcometh
my
just
shame
i
will
do
it
but
of
this
thou
mayst
be
assured
that
i
do
it
as
one
who
knoweth
himself
to
receive
of
thee
not
only
the
beloved
lady
but
with
her
his
life
the
gods
grant
an
it
be
possible
that
i
may
yet
be
able
to
show
thee
for
thine
honour
and
thy
weal
how
grateful
to
me
is
that
which
thou
more
pitiful
for
me
than
i
for
myself
dost
for
me
these
things
said
quoth
gisippus
this
matter
an
we
would
have
it
take
effect
meseemeth
this
course
is
to
be
held
as
thou
knowest
sophronia
after
long
treaty
between
my
kinsfolk
and
hers
is
become
my
affianced
bride
wherefore
should
i
now
go
about
to
say
that
i
will
not
have
her
to
wife
a
sore
scandal
would
ensue
thereof
and
i
should
anger
both
her
kinsfolk
and
mine
own
of
this
indeed
i
should
reck
nothing
an
i
saw
that
she
was
thereby
to
become
thine
but
i
misdoubt
me
that
an
i
renounce
her
at
this
point
her
kinsfolk
will
straightway
give
her
to
another
who
belike
will
not
be
thyself
and
so
wilt
thou
have
lost
that
which
i
shall
not
have
gained
wherefore
meseemeth
well
an
thou
be
content
that
i
follow
on
with
that
which
i
have
begun
and
bring
her
home
as
mine
and
hold
the
nuptials
and
thou
mayst
after
as
we
shall
know
how
to
contrive
privily
lie
with
her
as
with
thy
wife
then
in
due
place
and
season
we
will
make
manifest
the
fact
which
if
it
please
them
not
will
still
be
done
and
they
must
perforce
be
content
being
unable
to
go
back
upon
it
the
device
pleased
titus
wherefore
gisippus
received
the
lady
into
his
house
as
his
titus
being
by
this
recovered
and
in
good
case
and
after
holding
high
festival
the
night
being
come
the
ladies
left
the
wife
in
her
husband
bed
and
went
their
ways
now
titus
his
chamber
adjoined
that
of
gisippus
and
one
might
go
from
the
one
room
into
the
other
wherefore
gisippus
being
in
his
chamber
and
having
put
out
all
the
lights
betook
himself
stealthily
to
his
friend
and
bade
him
go
couch
with
his
mistress
titus
seeing
this
was
overcome
with
shame
and
would
fain
have
repented
and
refused
to
go
but
gisippus
who
with
his
whole
heart
no
less
than
in
words
was
minded
to
do
his
friend
pleasure
sent
him
thither
after
long
contention
whenas
he
came
into
the
bed
he
took
the
damsel
in
his
arms
and
asked
her
softly
as
if
in
sport
if
she
chose
to
be
his
wife
she
thinking
him
to
be
gisippus
answered
whereupon
he
set
a
goodly
and
rich
ring
on
her
finger
saying
i
choose
to
be
thy
husband
then
the
marriage
consummated
he
took
long
and
amorous
pleasance
of
her
without
her
or
others
anywise
perceiving
that
other
than
gisippus
lay
with
her
the
marriage
of
sophronia
and
titus
being
at
this
pass
publius
his
father
departed
this
life
wherefore
it
was
written
him
that
he
should
without
delay
return
to
rome
to
look
to
his
affairs
and
he
accordingly
took
counsel
with
gisippus
to
betake
himself
thither
and
carry
sophronia
with
him
which
might
not
nor
should
aptly
be
done
without
discovering
to
her
how
the
case
stood
accordingly
one
day
calling
her
into
the
chamber
they
thoroughly
discovered
to
her
the
fact
and
thereof
titus
certified
her
by
many
particulars
of
that
which
had
passed
between
them
twain
sophronia
after
eying
the
one
and
the
other
somewhat
despitefully
fell
bitterly
complaining
of
gisippus
his
deceit
then
rather
than
make
any
words
of
this
in
his
house
she
repaired
to
that
of
her
father
and
there
acquainted
him
and
her
mother
with
the
cheat
that
had
been
put
upon
her
and
them
by
gisippus
avouching
herself
to
be
the
wife
of
titus
and
not
of
gisippus
as
they
believed
this
was
exceeding
grievous
to
father
who
made
long
and
sore
complaint
thereof
to
her
kinsfolk
and
those
of
gisippus
and
much
and
great
was
the
talk
and
the
clamour
by
reason
thereof
gisippus
was
held
in
despite
both
by
his
own
kindred
and
those
of
sophronia
and
every
one
declared
him
worthy
not
only
of
blame
but
of
severe
chastisement
whilst
he
on
the
contrary
avouched
himself
to
have
done
an
honourable
thing
and
one
for
which
thanks
should
be
rendered
him
by
sophronia
kinsfolk
having
married
her
to
a
better
than
himself
titus
on
his
part
heard
and
suffered
everything
with
no
little
annoy
and
knowing
it
to
be
the
usance
of
the
greeks
to
press
on
with
clamours
and
menaces
till
such
times
as
they
found
who
should
answer
them
and
then
to
become
not
only
humble
but
abject
he
bethought
himself
that
their
clamour
was
no
longer
to
be
brooked
without
reply
and
having
a
roman
spirit
and
an
athenian
wit
he
adroitly
contrived
to
assemble
gisippus
his
kinsfolk
and
those
of
sophronia
in
a
temple
wherein
entering
accompanied
by
gisippus
alone
he
thus
bespoke
the
expectant
folk
is
the
belief
of
many
philosophers
that
the
actions
of
mortals
are
determined
and
foreordained
of
the
immortal
gods
wherefore
some
will
have
it
that
all
that
is
or
shall
ever
be
done
is
of
necessity
albeit
there
be
others
who
attribute
this
necessity
to
that
only
which
is
already
done
if
these
opinions
be
considered
with
any
diligence
it
will
very
manifestly
be
seen
that
to
blame
a
thing
which
can
not
be
undone
is
to
do
no
otherwhat
than
to
seek
to
show
oneself
wiser
than
the
gods
who
we
must
believe
dispose
of
and
govern
us
and
our
affairs
with
unfailing
wisdom
and
without
any
error
wherefore
you
may
very
easily
see
what
fond
and
brutish
overweening
it
is
to
presume
to
find
fault
with
their
operations
and
eke
how
many
and
what
chains
they
merit
who
suffer
themselves
be
so
far
carried
away
by
hardihood
as
to
do
this
of
whom
to
my
thinking
you
are
all
if
that
be
true
which
i
understand
you
have
said
and
still
say
for
that
sophronia
is
become
my
wife
whereas
you
had
given
her
to
gisippus
never
considering
that
it
was
foreordained
from
all
eternity
that
she
should
become
not
his
but
mine
as
by
the
issue
is
known
at
this
present
but
for
that
to
speak
of
the
secret
foreordinance
and
intention
of
the
gods
appeareth
unto
many
a
hard
thing
and
a
grievous
to
apprehend
i
am
willing
to
suppose
that
they
concern
not
themselves
with
aught
of
our
affairs
and
to
condescend
to
the
counsels
of
mankind
in
speaking
whereof
it
will
behove
me
to
do
two
things
both
very
contrary
to
my
usances
the
one
somedele
to
commend
myself
and
the
other
in
some
measure
to
blame
or
disparage
others
but
for
that
i
purpose
neither
in
the
one
nor
in
the
other
to
depart
from
the
truth
and
that
the
present
matter
requireth
it
i
will
do
it
footnote
or
arguments
your
complainings
dictated
more
by
rage
than
by
reason
upbraid
revile
and
condemn
gisippus
with
continual
murmurs
or
rather
clamours
for
that
of
his
counsel
he
hath
given
me
to
wife
her
whom
you
of
yours
had
given
him
whereas
i
hold
that
he
is
supremely
to
be
commended
therefor
and
that
for
two
reasons
the
one
for
that
he
hath
done
that
which
a
friend
should
do
and
the
other
for
that
he
hath
in
this
wrought
more
discreetly
than
did
you
that
which
the
sacred
laws
of
friendship
will
that
one
friend
should
do
for
the
other
it
is
not
my
intention
at
this
present
to
expound
being
content
to
have
recalled
to
you
this
much
only
thereof
to
wit
that
the
bonds
of
friendship
are
far
more
stringent
than
those
of
blood
or
of
kindred
seeing
that
the
friends
we
have
are
such
as
we
choose
for
ourselves
and
our
kinsfolk
such
as
fortune
giveth
us
wherefore
if
gisippus
loved
my
life
more
than
your
goodwill
i
being
his
friend
as
i
hold
myself
none
should
marvel
thereat
but
to
come
to
the
second
reason
whereanent
it
more
instantly
behoveth
to
show
you
that
he
hath
been
wiser
than
yourselves
since
meseemeth
you
reck
nothing
of
the
foreordinance
of
the
gods
and
know
yet
less
of
the
effects
of
friendship
i
say
then
that
you
of
your
judgment
of
your
counsel
and
of
your
deliberation
gave
sophronia
to
gisippus
a
young
man
and
a
philosopher
gisippus
of
his
gave
her
to
a
young
man
and
a
philosopher
your
counsel
gave
her
to
an
athenian
and
that
of
gisippus
to
a
roman
your
counsel
gave
her
to
a
youth
of
noble
birth
and
his
to
one
yet
nobler
yours
to
a
rich
youth
his
to
a
very
rich
yours
to
a
youth
who
not
only
loved
her
not
but
scarce
knew
her
his
to
one
who
loved
her
over
his
every
happiness
and
more
than
his
very
life
and
to
show
you
that
this
i
say
is
true
and
that
gisippus
his
action
is
more
commendable
than
yours
let
us
consider
it
part
by
part
that
i
like
gisippus
am
a
young
man
and
a
philosopher
my
favour
and
my
studies
may
declare
without
more
discourse
thereof
one
same
age
is
his
and
mine
and
still
with
equal
step
have
we
proceeded
studying
true
he
is
an
athenian
and
i
am
a
roman
if
it
be
disputed
of
the
glory
of
our
native
cities
i
say
that
i
am
a
citizen
of
a
free
city
and
he
of
a
tributary
one
i
am
of
a
city
mistress
of
the
whole
world
and
he
of
a
city
obedient
unto
mine
i
am
of
a
city
most
illustrious
in
arms
in
empery
and
in
letters
whereas
he
can
only
commend
his
own
for
letters
moreover
albeit
you
see
me
here
on
lowly
wise
enough
a
student
i
am
not
born
of
the
dregs
of
the
roman
populace
my
houses
and
the
public
places
of
rome
are
full
of
antique
images
of
my
ancestors
and
the
roman
annals
will
be
found
full
of
many
a
triumph
led
by
the
quintii
up
to
the
roman
capitol
nor
is
the
glory
of
our
name
fallen
for
age
into
decay
nay
it
presently
flourisheth
more
splendidly
than
ever
i
speak
not
for
shamefastness
of
my
riches
bearing
in
mind
that
honourable
poverty
hath
ever
been
the
ancient
and
most
ample
patrimony
of
the
noble
citizens
of
rome
but
if
this
be
condemned
of
the
opinion
of
the
vulgar
and
treasures
commended
i
am
abundantly
provided
with
these
latter
not
as
one
covetous
but
as
beloved
of
fortune
i
know
very
well
that
it
was
and
should
have
been
and
should
be
dear
unto
you
to
have
gisippus
here
in
athens
to
kinsman
but
i
ought
not
for
any
reason
to
be
less
dear
to
you
at
rome
considering
that
in
me
you
would
have
there
an
excellent
host
and
an
useful
and
diligent
and
powerful
patron
no
less
in
public
occasions
than
in
matters
of
private
need
footnote
of
your
counsel
footnote
my
riches
are
not
the
result
of
covetous
amassing
but
of
the
favours
of
fortune
who
then
letting
be
wilfulness
and
considering
with
reason
will
commend
your
counsels
above
those
of
my
gisippus
certes
none
sophronia
then
is
well
and
duly
married
to
titus
quintius
fulvus
a
noble
rich
and
citizen
of
rome
and
a
friend
of
gisippus
wherefore
whoso
complaineth
or
maketh
moan
of
this
doth
not
that
which
he
ought
neither
knoweth
that
which
he
doth
some
perchance
will
say
that
they
complain
not
of
sophronia
being
the
wife
of
titus
but
of
the
manner
wherein
she
became
his
wife
to
wit
in
secret
and
by
stealth
without
friend
or
kinsman
knowing
aught
thereof
but
this
is
no
marvel
nor
thing
that
betideth
newly
i
willingly
leave
be
those
who
have
aforetime
taken
husbands
against
their
parents
will
and
those
who
have
fled
with
their
lovers
and
have
been
mistresses
before
they
were
wives
and
those
who
have
discovered
themselves
to
be
married
rather
by
pregnancy
or
than
with
the
tongue
yet
hath
necessity
commended
it
to
their
kinsfolk
nothing
of
which
hath
happened
in
sophronia
case
nay
she
hath
orderly
discreetly
and
honourably
been
given
by
gisippus
to
titus
others
will
say
that
he
gave
her
in
marriage
to
whom
it
appertained
not
to
do
so
but
these
be
all
foolish
and
womanish
complaints
and
proceed
from
lack
of
advisement
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
fortune
hath
made
use
of
various
means
and
strange
instruments
to
bring
matters
to
foreordained
issues
what
have
i
to
care
if
it
be
a
cordwainer
rather
than
a
philosopher
that
hath
according
to
his
judgment
despatched
an
affair
of
mine
and
whether
in
secret
or
openly
provided
the
issue
be
good
if
the
cordwainer
be
indiscreet
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
look
well
that
he
have
no
more
to
do
with
my
affairs
and
thank
him
for
that
which
is
done
if
gisippus
hath
married
sophronia
well
it
is
a
superfluous
folly
to
go
complaining
of
the
manner
and
of
him
if
you
have
no
confidence
in
his
judgment
look
he
have
no
more
of
your
daughters
to
marry
and
thank
him
for
this
one
nevertheless
i
would
have
you
to
know
that
i
sought
not
either
by
art
or
by
fraud
to
impose
any
stain
upon
the
honour
and
illustriousness
of
your
blood
in
the
person
of
sophronia
and
that
albeit
i
took
her
secretly
to
wife
i
came
not
as
a
ravisher
to
rob
her
of
her
maidenhead
nor
sought
after
the
manner
of
an
enemy
whilst
shunning
your
alliance
to
have
her
otherwise
than
honourably
but
being
ardently
enkindled
by
her
lovesome
beauty
and
by
her
worth
and
knowing
that
had
i
sought
her
with
that
ordinance
which
you
will
maybe
say
i
should
have
used
i
should
not
she
being
much
beloved
of
you
have
had
her
for
fear
lest
i
should
carry
her
off
to
rome
i
used
the
occult
means
that
may
now
be
discovered
to
you
and
caused
gisippus
in
my
person
consent
unto
that
which
he
himself
was
not
disposed
to
do
moreover
ardently
as
i
loved
her
i
sought
her
embraces
not
as
a
lover
but
as
a
husband
nor
as
she
herself
can
truly
testify
did
i
draw
near
to
her
till
i
had
first
both
with
the
due
words
and
with
the
ring
espoused
her
asking
her
if
she
would
have
me
for
husband
to
which
she
answered
ay
if
it
appear
to
her
that
she
hath
been
deceived
it
is
not
i
who
am
to
blame
therefor
but
she
who
asked
me
not
who
i
was
this
then
is
the
great
misdeed
the
grievous
crime
the
sore
default
committed
by
gisippus
as
a
friend
and
by
myself
as
a
lover
to
wit
that
sophronia
hath
secretly
become
the
wife
of
titus
quintius
and
this
it
is
for
which
you
defame
and
menace
and
plot
against
him
what
more
could
you
do
had
he
bestowed
her
upon
a
churl
a
losel
or
a
slave
what
chains
what
prison
what
gibbets
had
sufficed
thereunto
but
let
that
be
for
the
present
the
time
is
come
which
i
looked
not
for
yet
to
wit
my
father
is
dead
and
it
behoveth
me
return
to
rome
wherefore
meaning
to
carry
sophronia
with
me
i
have
discovered
to
you
that
which
i
should
otherwise
belike
have
yet
kept
hidden
from
you
and
with
which
an
you
be
wise
you
will
cheerfully
put
up
for
that
had
i
wished
to
cheat
or
outrage
you
i
might
have
left
her
to
you
scorned
and
dishonored
but
god
forfend
that
such
a
baseness
should
ever
avail
to
harbour
in
a
roman
breast
she
then
namely
sophronia
by
the
consent
of
the
gods
and
the
operation
of
the
laws
of
mankind
no
less
than
by
the
admirable
contrivance
of
my
gisippus
and
mine
own
amorous
astuteness
is
become
mine
and
this
it
seemeth
that
you
holding
yourselves
belike
wiser
than
the
gods
and
than
the
rest
of
mankind
brutishly
condemn
showing
your
disapproval
in
two
ways
both
exceedingly
noyous
to
myself
first
by
detaining
sophronia
over
whom
you
have
no
right
save
in
so
far
as
it
pleaseth
me
to
allow
it
and
secondly
by
entreating
gisippus
to
whom
you
are
justly
beholden
as
an
enemy
how
foolishly
you
do
in
both
which
things
i
purpose
not
at
this
present
to
make
farther
manifest
to
you
but
will
only
counsel
you
as
a
friend
to
lay
by
your
despites
and
altogether
leaving
your
resentments
and
the
rancours
that
you
have
conceived
to
restore
sophronia
to
me
so
i
may
joyfully
depart
your
kinsman
and
live
your
friend
for
of
this
whether
that
which
is
done
please
you
or
please
you
not
you
may
be
assured
that
if
you
offer
to
do
otherwise
i
will
take
gisippus
from
you
and
if
i
win
to
rome
i
will
without
fail
however
ill
you
may
take
it
have
her
again
who
is
justly
mine
and
ever
after
showing
myself
your
enemy
will
cause
you
know
by
experience
that
whereof
the
despite
of
roman
souls
is
capable
titus
having
thus
spoken
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
countenance
all
disordered
for
anger
and
taking
gisippus
by
the
hand
went
forth
of
the
temple
shaking
his
head
threateningly
and
showing
that
he
recked
little
of
as
many
as
were
there
the
latter
in
part
reconciled
by
his
reasonings
to
the
alliance
and
desirous
of
his
friendship
and
in
part
terrified
by
his
last
words
of
one
accord
determined
that
it
was
better
to
have
him
for
a
kinsman
since
gisippus
had
not
willed
it
than
to
have
lost
the
latter
to
kinsman
and
gotten
the
former
for
an
enemy
accordingly
going
in
quest
of
titus
they
told
him
that
they
were
willing
that
sophronia
should
be
his
and
to
have
him
for
a
dear
kinsman
and
gisippus
for
a
dear
friend
then
having
mutually
done
each
other
such
honours
and
courtesies
as
beseem
between
kinsmen
and
friends
they
took
their
leaves
and
sent
sophronia
back
to
him
she
like
a
wise
woman
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
readily
transferred
to
titus
the
affection
she
bore
gisippus
and
repaired
with
him
to
rome
where
she
was
received
with
great
honour
meanwhile
gisippus
abode
in
athens
held
in
little
esteem
of
well
nigh
all
and
no
great
while
after
through
certain
intestine
troubles
was
with
all
those
of
his
house
expelled
from
athens
in
poverty
and
misery
and
condemned
to
perpetual
exile
finding
himself
in
this
case
and
being
grown
not
only
poor
but
beggarly
he
betook
himself
as
least
ill
he
might
to
rome
to
essay
if
titus
should
remember
him
there
learning
that
the
latter
was
alive
and
high
in
favour
with
all
the
romans
and
enquiring
for
his
he
stationed
himself
before
the
door
and
there
abode
till
such
time
as
titus
came
to
whom
by
reason
of
the
wretched
plight
wherein
he
was
he
dared
not
say
a
word
but
studied
to
cause
himself
be
seen
of
him
so
he
might
recognize
him
and
let
call
him
to
himself
wherefore
titus
passed
on
without
noting
him
and
gisippus
conceiving
that
he
had
seen
and
shunned
him
and
remembering
him
of
that
which
himself
had
done
for
him
aforetime
departed
despiteful
and
despairing
it
being
by
this
night
and
he
fasting
and
penniless
he
wandered
on
unknowing
whither
and
more
desirous
of
death
than
of
otherwhat
and
presently
happened
upon
a
very
desert
part
of
the
city
where
seeing
a
great
cavern
he
addressed
himself
to
abide
the
night
there
and
presently
forspent
with
long
weeping
he
fell
asleep
on
the
naked
earth
and
ill
in
case
to
this
cavern
two
who
had
gone
together
that
night
came
towards
morning
with
the
booty
they
had
gotten
and
falling
out
over
the
division
one
who
was
the
stronger
slew
the
other
and
went
away
gisippus
had
seen
and
heard
this
and
himseemed
he
had
found
a
way
to
the
death
so
sore
desired
of
him
without
slaying
himself
wherefore
he
abode
without
stirring
till
such
time
as
the
serjeants
of
the
watch
who
had
by
this
gotten
wind
of
the
deed
came
thither
and
laying
furious
hands
of
him
carried
him
off
prisoner
gisippus
being
examined
confessed
that
he
had
murdered
the
man
nor
had
since
availed
to
depart
the
cavern
whereupon
the
pr√¶tor
who
was
called
marcus
varro
commanded
that
he
should
be
put
to
death
upon
the
cross
as
the
usance
then
was
now
titus
was
by
chance
come
at
that
juncture
to
the
pr√¶torium
and
looking
the
wretched
condemned
man
in
the
face
and
hearing
why
he
had
been
doomed
to
die
suddenly
knew
him
for
gisippus
whereupon
marvelling
at
his
sorry
fortune
and
how
he
came
to
be
in
rome
and
desiring
most
ardently
to
succour
him
but
seeing
no
other
means
of
saving
him
than
to
accuse
himself
and
thus
excuse
him
he
thrust
forward
in
haste
and
cried
out
saying
varro
call
back
the
poor
man
whom
thou
hast
condemned
for
that
he
is
innocent
i
have
enough
offended
against
the
gods
with
one
crime
in
slaying
him
whom
thine
officer
found
this
morning
dead
without
willing
presently
to
wrong
them
with
the
death
of
another
innocent
varro
marvelled
and
it
irked
him
that
all
the
pr√¶torium
should
have
heard
him
but
being
unable
for
his
own
honour
sake
to
forbear
from
doing
that
which
the
laws
commanded
he
caused
bring
back
gisippus
and
in
the
presence
of
titus
said
to
him
camest
thou
to
be
so
mad
that
without
suffering
any
torture
thou
confessedst
to
that
which
thou
didst
not
it
being
a
capital
matter
thou
declaredst
thyself
to
be
he
who
slew
the
man
yesternight
and
now
this
man
cometh
and
saith
that
it
was
not
thou
but
he
that
slew
him
gisippus
looked
and
seeing
that
it
was
titus
perceived
full
well
that
he
did
this
to
save
him
as
grateful
for
the
service
aforetime
received
from
him
wherefore
weeping
for
pity
quoth
he
it
was
i
slew
him
and
titus
his
solicitude
for
my
safety
is
now
too
late
titus
on
the
other
hand
said
do
as
thou
seest
this
man
is
a
stranger
and
was
found
without
arms
beside
the
murdered
man
and
thou
mayst
see
that
his
wretchedness
giveth
him
occasion
to
wish
to
die
wherefore
do
thou
release
him
and
punish
me
who
have
deserved
it
varro
marvelled
at
the
insistence
of
these
two
and
beginning
now
to
presume
that
neither
of
them
might
be
guilty
was
casting
about
for
a
means
of
acquitting
them
when
behold
up
came
a
youth
called
publius
ambustus
a
man
of
notorious
ill
life
and
known
to
all
the
romans
for
an
arrant
rogue
who
had
actually
done
the
murder
and
knowing
neither
of
the
twain
to
be
guilty
of
that
whereof
each
accused
himself
such
was
the
pity
that
overcame
his
heart
for
the
innocence
of
the
two
friends
that
moved
by
supreme
compassion
he
came
before
varro
and
said
my
fates
impel
me
to
solve
the
grievous
contention
of
these
twain
and
i
know
not
what
god
within
me
spurreth
and
importuneth
me
to
discover
to
thee
my
sin
know
then
that
neither
of
these
men
is
guilty
of
that
whereof
each
accuseth
himself
i
am
verily
he
who
slew
yonder
man
this
morning
towards
daybreak
and
i
saw
this
poor
wretch
asleep
there
what
while
i
was
in
act
to
divide
the
booty
gotten
with
him
whom
i
slew
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
excuse
titus
his
renown
is
everywhere
manifest
and
every
one
knoweth
him
to
be
no
man
of
such
a
condition
release
him
therefore
and
take
of
me
that
forfeit
which
the
laws
impose
on
me
by
this
octavianus
had
notice
of
the
matter
and
causing
all
three
be
brought
before
him
desired
to
hear
what
cause
had
moved
each
of
them
to
seek
to
be
the
condemned
man
accordingly
each
related
his
own
story
whereupon
octavianus
released
the
two
friends
for
that
they
were
innocent
and
pardoned
the
other
for
the
love
of
them
thereupon
titus
took
his
gisippus
and
first
reproaching
him
sore
for
lukewarmness
and
diffidence
rejoiced
in
him
with
marvellous
great
joy
and
carried
him
to
his
house
where
sophronia
with
tears
of
compassion
received
him
as
a
brother
then
having
awhile
recruited
him
with
rest
and
refreshment
and
reclothed
him
and
restored
him
to
such
a
habit
as
sorted
with
his
worth
and
quality
he
first
shared
all
his
treasures
and
estates
in
common
with
him
and
after
gave
him
to
wife
a
young
sister
of
his
called
fulvia

henceforth

resteth
with
thee
whether
thou
wilt

he
justly
bore

see
the

set
out
in

the
soldan
enquiring
of
one
of
his
servants
how
far
they
were
yet
distant
from
pavia
and
if
he
might
win
thither
in
time
to
enter
the
city
he
suffered
not
the
man
to
reply
but
himself
answered
you
can
not
reach
pavia
in
time
to
enter
therein
said
saladin
it
please
you
acquaint
us
for
that
we
are
strangers
where
we
may
best
lodge
the
night
quoth
messer
torello
will
i
willingly
do
i
had
it
presently
in
mind
to
dispatch
one
of
my
men
here
to
the
neighborhood
of
pavia
for
somewhat
i
will
send
him
with
you
and
he
shall
bring
you
to
a
place
where
you
may
lodge
conveniently
enough
then
turning
to
the
discreetest
of
his
men
he
privily
enjoined
him
what
he
should
do
and
sent
him
with
them
whilst
he
himself
making
for
his
country
house
let
order
as
best
he
might
a
goodly
supper
and
set
the
tables
in
the
garden
which
done
he
posted
himself
at
the
door
to
await
his
guests
footnote
to
cross
the
alps
into
france
meanwhile
the
servant
devising
with
the
gentlemen
of
one
thing
and
another
led
them
about
by
certain
and
brought
them
without
their
suspecting
it
to
his
lord
residence
where
whenas
messer
torello
saw
them
he
came
to
meet
them
afoot
and
said
smiling
you
are
very
welcome
saladin
who
was
very
quick
of
apprehension
understood
that
the
gentleman
had
misdoubted
him
they
would
not
have
accepted
his
invitation
had
he
bidden
them
whenas
he
fell
in
with
them
and
had
therefore
brought
them
by
practice
to
his
house
so
they
might
not
avail
to
refuse
to
pass
the
night
with
him
and
accordingly
returning
his
greeting
he
said
an
one
could
complain
of
men
of
courtesy
we
might
complain
of
you
for
that
letting
be
that
you
have
somewhat
hindered
us
from
our
road
you
have
without
our
having
merited
your
goodwill
otherwise
than
by
a
mere
salutation
constrained
us
to
accept
of
such
noble
hospitality
as
is
this
of
yours
answered
messer
torello
who
was
a
discreet
and
man
is
but
a
sorry
hospitality
that
you
will
receive
from
us
regard
had
to
that
which
should
behove
unto
you
an
i
may
judge
by
that
which
i
apprehend
from
your
carriage
and
that
of
your
companions
but
in
truth
you
could
nowhere
out
of
pavia
have
found
any
decent
place
of
entertainment
wherefore
let
it
not
irk
you
to
have
gone
somedele
beside
your
way
to
have
a
little
less
unease
meanwhile
his
servants
came
round
about
the
travellers
and
helping
them
to
dismount
eased
their
horses
footnote
see
note
messer
torello
then
brought
the
three
stranger
gentlemen
to
the
chambers
prepared
for
them
where
he
let
unboot
them
and
refresh
them
somewhat
with
very
cool
wines
and
entertained
them
in
agreeable
discourse
till
such
time
as
they
might
sup
saladin
and
his
companions
and
servants
all
knew
latin
wherefore
they
understood
very
well
and
were
understood
and
it
seemed
to
each
of
them
that
this
gentleman
was
the
most
pleasant
and
man
they
had
ever
seen
ay
and
the
best
spoken
it
appeared
to
messer
torello
on
the
other
hand
that
they
were
men
of
magnificent
fashions
and
much
more
of
account
than
he
had
at
first
conceived
wherefore
he
was
inwardly
chagrined
that
he
could
not
honour
them
that
evening
with
companions
and
with
a
more
considerable
entertainment
but
for
this
he
bethought
himself
to
make
them
amends
on
the
morrow
and
accordingly
having
instructed
one
of
his
servants
of
that
which
he
would
have
done
he
despatched
him
to
pavia
which
was
very
near
at
hand
and
where
no
gate
was
ever
locked
to
his
lady
who
was
exceeding
discreet
and
then
carrying
the
gentlemen
into
the
garden
he
courteously
asked
them
who
they
were
to
which
saladin
answered
are
merchants
from
cyprus
and
are
bound
to
paris
on
our
occasions
to
god
cried
messer
torello
this
our
country
produced
gentlemen
of
such
a
fashion
as
i
see
cyprus
doth
merchants
in
these
and
other
discourses
they
abode
till
it
was
time
to
sup
whereupon
he
left
it
to
them
to
honour
themselves
at
table
and
there
for
an
improvised
supper
they
were
very
well
and
orderly
served
nor
had
they
abidden
long
after
the
tables
were
removed
when
messer
torello
judging
them
to
be
weary
put
them
to
sleep
in
very
goodly
beds
and
himself
a
little
after
in
like
manner
betook
himself
to
rest
footnote
to
place
themselves
according
to
their
several
ranks
which
were
unknown
to
torello
meanwhile
the
servant
sent
to
pavia
did
his
errand
to
the
lady
who
with
no
womanly
but
with
a
royal
spirit
let
call
in
haste
a
great
number
of
the
friends
and
servants
of
messer
torello
and
made
ready
all
that
behoved
unto
a
magnificent
banquet
moreover
she
let
bid
by
torchlight
many
of
the
noblest
of
the
townfolk
to
the
banquet
and
bringing
out
cloths
and
silks
and
furs
caused
throughly
order
that
which
her
husband
had
sent
to
bid
her
do
the
day
come
saladin
and
his
companions
arose
whereupon
messer
torello
took
horse
with
them
and
sending
for
his
falcons
carried
them
to
a
neighbouring
ford
and
there
showed
them
how
the
latter
flew
then
saladin
enquiring
for
some
one
who
should
bring
him
to
pavia
and
to
the
best
inn
his
host
said
will
be
your
guide
for
that
it
behoveth
me
go
thither
the
others
believing
this
were
content
and
set
out
in
company
with
him
for
the
city
which
they
reached
about
tierce
and
thinking
to
be
on
their
way
to
the
best
inn
were
carried
by
messer
torello
to
his
own
house
where
a
good
of
the
most
considerable
citizens
were
already
come
to
receive
the
stranger
gentlemen
and
were
straightway
about
their
bridles
and
stirrups
saladin
and
his
companions
seeing
this
understood
but
too
well
what
was
forward
and
said
torello
this
is
not
what
we
asked
of
you
you
have
done
enough
for
us
this
past
night
ay
and
far
more
than
we
are
worth
wherefore
you
might
now
fitly
suffer
us
fare
on
our
way
replied
messer
torello
my
yesternight
dealing
with
you
i
am
more
indebted
to
fortune
than
to
you
which
took
you
on
the
road
at
an
hour
when
it
behoved
you
come
to
my
poor
house
but
of
your
this
morning
visit
i
shall
be
beholden
to
yourselves
and
with
me
all
these
gentlemen
who
are
about
you
and
to
whom
an
it
seem
to
you
courteous
to
refuse
to
dine
with
them
you
can
do
so
if
you
will
saladin
and
his
companions
overcome
dismounted
and
being
joyfully
received
by
the
assembled
company
were
carried
to
chambers
which
had
been
most
sumptuously
arrayed
for
them
where
having
put
off
their
travelling
gear
and
somewhat
refreshed
themselves
they
repaired
to
the
saloon
where
the
banquet
was
splendidly
prepared
water
having
been
given
to
the
hands
they
were
seated
at
table
with
the
goodliest
and
most
orderly
observance
and
magnificently
served
with
many
viands
insomuch
that
were
the
emperor
himself
come
thither
it
had
been
impossible
to
do
him
more
honour
and
albeit
saladin
and
his
companions
were
great
lords
and
used
to
see
very
great
things
natheless
they
were
mightily
wondered
at
this
and
it
seemed
to
them
of
the
greatest
having
regard
to
the
quality
of
the
gentleman
whom
they
knew
to
be
only
a
citizen
and
not
a
lord
dinner
ended
and
the
tables
removed
they
conversed
awhile
of
divers
things
then
at
messer
torello
instance
the
heat
being
great
the
gentlemen
of
pavia
all
betook
themselves
to
repose
whilst
he
himself
abiding
alone
with
his
three
guests
carried
them
into
a
chamber
and
that
no
precious
thing
of
his
should
remain
unseen
of
them
let
call
thither
his
noble
lady
accordingly
the
latter
who
was
very
fair
and
tall
of
her
person
came
in
to
them
arrayed
in
rich
apparel
and
flanked
by
two
little
sons
of
hers
as
they
were
two
angels
and
saluted
them
courteously
the
strangers
seeing
her
rose
to
their
feet
and
receiving
her
with
worship
caused
her
sit
among
them
and
made
much
of
her
two
fair
children
therewithal
she
entered
into
pleasant
discourse
with
them
and
presently
messer
torello
having
gone
out
awhile
she
asked
them
courteously
whence
they
were
and
whither
they
went
to
which
they
made
answer
even
as
they
had
done
to
her
husband
whereupon
quoth
she
with
a
blithe
air
see
i
that
my
womanly
advisement
will
be
useful
wherefore
i
pray
you
of
your
especial
favour
refuse
me
not
neither
disdain
a
slight
present
which
i
shall
cause
bring
you
but
accept
it
considering
that
women
of
their
little
heart
give
little
things
and
regarding
more
the
goodwill
of
the
giver
than
the
value
of
the
gift
then
letting
fetch
them
each
two
gowns
one
lined
with
silk
and
the
other
with
miniver
no
wise
citizens
clothes
nor
merchants
but
fit
for
great
lords
to
wear
and
three
doublets
of
sendal
and
linen
breeches
to
match
she
said
these
i
have
clad
my
lord
in
gowns
of
the
like
fashion
and
the
other
things
for
all
they
are
little
worth
may
be
acceptable
to
you
considering
that
you
are
far
from
your
ladies
and
the
length
of
the
way
you
have
travelled
and
that
which
is
yet
to
travel
and
that
merchants
are
proper
men
and
nice
of
their
persons
the
saracens
marvelled
and
manifestly
perceived
that
messer
torello
was
minded
to
leave
no
particular
of
hospitality
undone
them
nay
seeing
the
magnificence
of
the
unmerchantlike
gowns
they
misdoubted
them
they
had
been
recognized
of
him
however
one
of
them
made
answer
to
the
lady
saying
these
are
very
great
matters
and
such
as
should
not
lightly
be
accepted
an
your
prayers
to
which
it
is
impossible
to
say
no
constrained
us
not
thereto
this
done
and
messer
torello
being
now
returned
the
lady
commending
them
to
god
took
leave
of
them
and
let
furnish
their
servants
with
like
things
such
as
sorted
with
their
condition
messer
torello
with
many
prayers
prevailed
upon
them
to
abide
with
him
all
that
day
wherefore
after
they
had
slept
awhile
they
donned
their
gowns
and
rode
with
him
somedele
about
the
city
then
the
come
they
supped
magnificently
with
many
worshipful
companions
and
in
due
time
betook
themselves
to
rest
on
the
morrow
they
arose
with
day
and
found
in
place
of
their
tired
hackneys
three
stout
and
good
palfreys
and
on
likewise
fresh
and
strong
horses
for
their
servants
which
when
saladin
saw
he
turned
to
his
companions
and
said
vow
to
god
that
never
was
there
a
more
accomplished
gentleman
nor
a
more
courteous
and
apprehensive
than
this
one
and
if
the
kings
of
the
christians
are
kings
of
such
a
fashion
as
this
is
a
gentleman
the
soldan
of
babylon
can
never
hope
to
stand
against
a
single
one
of
them
not
to
speak
of
the
many
whom
we
see
make
ready
to
fall
upon
him
then
knowing
that
it
were
in
vain
to
seek
to
refuse
this
new
gift
they
very
courteously
thanked
him
therefor
and
mounted
to
horse
messer
torello
with
many
companions
brought
them
a
great
way
without
the
city
till
grievous
as
it
was
to
saladin
to
part
from
him
so
much
was
he
by
this
grown
enamoured
of
him
natheless
need
constraining
him
to
press
on
he
presently
besought
him
to
turn
back
whereupon
loath
as
he
was
to
leave
them
quoth
he
it
pleaseth
you
i
will
do
it
but
one
thing
i
will
say
to
you
i
know
not
who
you
are
nor
do
i
ask
to
know
more
thereof
than
it
pleaseth
you
to
tell
me
but
be
you
who
you
may
you
will
never
make
me
believe
that
you
are
merchants
and
so
i
commend
you
to
god
saladin
having
by
this
taken
leave
of
all
messer
companions
replied
to
him
saying
we
may
yet
chance
to
let
you
see
somewhat
of
our
merchandise
whereby
we
may
confirm
your
belief
meantime
god
be
with
you
thereupon
he
departed
with
his
followers
firmly
resolved
if
life
should
endure
to
him
and
the
war
he
looked
for
undo
him
not
to
do
messer
torello
no
less
honour
than
that
which
he
had
done
him
and
much
did
he
discourse
with
his
companions
of
him
and
of
his
lady
and
all
his
affairs
and
fashions
and
dealings
mightily
commending
everything
then
after
he
had
with
no
little
fatigue
visited
all
the
west
he
took
ship
with
his
companions
and
returned
to
alexandria
where
being
now
fully
informed
he
addressed
himself
to
his
defence
as
for
messer
torello
he
returned
to
pavia
and
went
long
in
thought
who
these
might
be
but
never
hit
upon
the
truth
no
nor
came
near
it
footnote
sic
vostra
credenza
but
the
meaning
is
whereby
we
may
amend
your
unbelief
and
give
you
cause
to
credit
our
assertion
that
we
are
merchants
the
time
being
now
come
for
the
crusade
and
great
preparations
made
everywhere
messer
torello
notwithstanding
the
tears
and
entreaties
of
his
wife
was
altogether
resolved
to
go
thereon
and
having
made
his
every
provision
and
being
about
to
take
horse
he
said
to
his

he
loved
over

as
thou
seest
i
go
on
this
crusade
as
well
for
the
honour

as
for

i
commend

thee
our

for
that
i
am

of
the
going
but
of
the
returning
for
a
thousand
chances

betide
i
have
no

thee

thou
shalt
await
me
a
year
and
a
month
and
a
day
ere
thou
marry
again
beginning
from
this
the
day
of
my
departure
the
lady
who
wept
sore
answered
torello
i
know
not
how
i
shall
endure
the
chagrin
wherein
you
leave
me
by
your
departure

an
my
life
prove
stronger

aught
befall
you
you
may
live
and
die

that
i
shall
live
and
die
the
wife
of
messer
torello
and
of
his
memory
rejoined
messer
torello
am
very
certain
that
inasmuch
as
in
thee
lieth
this
that
thou
promisest
me
will
come
to
pass
but
thou
art
a
young
woman
and
fair
and
of
high
family
and
thy
worth
is
great
and
everywhere
known
wherefore
i
doubt
not
but
many
great
and
noble
gentlemen
will
should
aught
be
misdoubted
of
me
demand
thee
of
thy
brethren
and
kinsfolk
from
whose
importunities
how
much
soever
thou
mightest
wish
thou
wilt
not
be
able
to
defend
thyself
and
it
will
behove
thee
perforce
comply
with
their
wishes
and
this
is
why
i
ask
of
thee
this
term
and
not
a
greater
one
quoth
the
lady
will
do
what
i
may
of
that
which
i
have
told
you
and
should
it
nevertheless
behove
me
to
do
otherwise
i
will
assuredly
obey
you
in
this
that
you
enjoin
me
but
i
pray
god
that
he
bring
nor
you
nor
me
to
such
an
extremity
in
these
days
this
said
she
embraced
him
weeping
and
drawing
a
ring
from
her
finger
gave
it
to
him
saying
it
chance
that
i
die
ere
i
see
you
again
remember
me
when
you
look
upon
this
ring
footnote
should
any
rumour
get
wind
of
death
torello
took
the
ring
and
mounted
to
horse
then
bidding
all
his
people
adieu
he
set
out
on
his
journey
and
came
presently
with
his
company
to
genoa
there
he
embarked
on
board
a
galleon
and
coming
in
a
little
while
to
acre
joined
himself
to
the
other
army
of
the
christians
wherein
well
nigh
out
of
hand
there
began
a
sore
sickness
and
mortality
during
this
whether
by
saladin
skill
or
of
his
good
fortune
well
nigh
all
the
remnant
of
the
christians
who
had
escaped
alive
were
taken
by
him
without
blow
stricken
and
divided
among
many
cities
and
imprisoned
messer
torello
was
one
of
those
taken
and
was
carried
prisoner
to
alexandria
where
being
unknown
and
fearing
to
make
himself
known
he
addressed
himself
of
necessity
constrained
to
the
training
of
hawks
of
which
he
was
a
great
master
and
by
this
he
came
under
the
notice
of
saladin
who
took
him
out
of
prison
and
entertained
him
for
his
falconer
messer
torello
who
was
called
by
the
soldan
by
none
other
name
than
the
christian
recognized
him
not
nor
did
saladin
recognize
him
nay
all
his
thoughts
were
in
pavia
and
he
had
more
than
once
essayed
to
flee
but
without
avail
wherefore
certain
genoese
coming
ambassadors
to
saladin
to
treat
for
the
ransom
of
sundry
of
their
townsmen
and
being
about
to
depart
he
bethought
himself
to
write
to
his
lady
giving
her
to
know
that
he
was
alive
and
would
return
to
her
as
quickliest
he
might
and
bidding
her
await
him
accordingly
he
wrote
letters
to
this
effect
and
instantly
besought
one
of
the
ambassadors
whom
he
knew
to
cause
them
come
to
the
hands
of
the
abbot
of
san
pietro
in
ciel
who
was
his
uncle

the

such
part
of

things
being
at
this
pass
with
him
it
befell
one
day
that
as
saladin
was
devising
with
him
of
his
hawks
messer
torello
chanced
to
smile
and
made
a
motion
with
his
mouth
which
the
former
had
much
noted
what
while
he
was
in
his
house
at
pavia
this
brought
the
gentleman
to
his
mind
and
looking
steadfastly
upon
him
himseemed
it
was
himself
wherefore
leaving
the
former
discourse
christian
said
he
countryman
art
thou
of
the
west
lord
replied
torello
am
a
lombard
of
a
city
called
pavia
a
poor
man
and
of
mean
condition
saladin
hearing
this
was
in
a
manner
certified
of
the
truth
of
his
suspicion
and
said
joyfully
in
himself
hath
vouchsafed
me
an
opportunity
of
showing
this
man
how
grateful
his
courtesy
was
to
me
accordingly
without
saying
otherwhat
he
let
lay
out
all
his
apparel
in
a
chamber
and
carrying
him
thither
said
to
him
christian
if
there
be
any
among
these
gowns
that
thou
hast
ever
seen
torello
looked
and
saw
those
which
his
lady
had
given
saladin
but
natheless
conceiving
not
that
they
could
possibly
be
the
same
he
answered
lord
i
know
none
of
them
albeit
in
good
sooth
these
twain
do
favour
certain
gowns
wherewithal
i
together
with
three
merchants
who
came
to
my
house
was
invested
aforetime
thereupon
saladin
unable
to
contain
himself
farther
embraced
him
tenderly
saying
are
messer
torello
and
i
am
one
of
the
three
merchants
to
whom
your
lady
gave
these
gowns
and
now
is
the
time
come
to
certify
you
what
manner
merchandise
mine
is
even
as
i
told
you
at
my
parting
from
you
might
chance
to
betide
messer
torello
hearing
this
was
at
once
rejoiced
and
ashamed
rejoiced
to
have
had
such
a
guest
and
ashamed
for
that
himseemed
he
had
entertained
him
but
scurvily
then
said
saladin
torello
since
god
hath
sent
you
hither
to
me
henceforth
consider
that
not
i
but
you
are
master
here
accordingly
after
they
had
mightily
rejoiced
in
each
other
he
clad
him
in
royal
apparel
and
carrying
him
into
the
presence
of
all
his
chief
barons
commanded
after
saying
many
things
in
praise
of
his
worth
that
he
should
of
all
who
held
his
favour
dear
be
honoured
as
himself
which
was
thenceforward
done
of
all
but
above
all
of
the
two
gentlemen
who
had
been
companions
in
his
house
the
sudden
height
of
glory
to
which
messer
torello
thus
found
himself
advanced
put
his
lombardy
affairs
somedele
out
of
his
mind
more
by
token
that
he
had
good
reason
to
hope
that
his
letters
were
by
this
come
to
his
uncle
hands
now
there
had
died
and
been
buried
in
the
camp
or
rather
in
the
host
of
the
christians
the
day
they
were
taken
by
saladin
a
proven√ßal
gentleman
of
little
account
by
name
messer
torello
de
dignes
by
reason
whereof
messer
torello
being
renowned
throughout
the
army
for
his
magnificence
whosoever
heard
say
torello
is
dead
believed
it
of
messer
torello
not
of
him
of
dignes
the
hazard
of
the
capture
that
ensued
thereupon
suffered
not
those
who
had
been
thus
misled
to
be
undeceived
wherefore
many
italians
returned
with
this
news
amongst
whom
were
some
who
scrupled
not
to
avouch
that
they
had
seen
him
dead
and
had
been
at
the
burial
this
coming
to
be
known
of
his
wife
and
kinsfolk
was
the
cause
of
grievous
and
inexpressible
sorrow
not
only
to
them
but
to
all
who
had
known
him
it
were
longsome
to
set
forth
what
and
how
great
was
the
grief
and
sorrow
and
lamentation
of
his
lady
but
after
having
bemoaned
herself
some
months
in
continual
affliction
coming
to
sorrow
less
and
being
sought
in
marriage
with
the
chiefest
men
in
lombardy
she
began
to
be
presently
importuned
by
her
brothers
and
other
her
kinsfolk
to
marry
again
after
having
again
and
again
refused
with
many
tears
needs
must
she
at
the
last
consent
perforce
to
do
her
kinsfolk
will
on
condition
that
she
should
abide
without
going
to
a
husband
so
long
as
she
had
promised
messer
torello
the
lady
affairs
at
pavia
being
at
this
pass
and
there
lacking
maybe
eight
days
of
the
term
appointed
for
her
going
to
her
new
husband
it
chanced
that
messer
torello
espied
one
day
in
alexandria
one
whom
he
had
seen
embark
with
the
genoese
ambassadors
on
board
the
galley
that
was
to
carry
them
back
to
genoa
and
calling
him
asked
him
what
manner
voyage
they
had
had
and
when
they
had
reached
genoa
whereto
the
other
replied
the
galleon
as
i
heard
in
crete
where
i
remained
made
an
ill
voyage
for
that
as
she
drew
near
unto
sicily
there
arose
a
furious
northerly
wind
which
drove
her
on
to
the
barbary
quicksands
nor
was
any
one
saved
and
amongst
the
rest
two
brothers
of
mine
perished
there
messer
torello
giving
credit
to
his
words
which
were
indeed
but
too
true
and
remembering
him
that
the
term
required
by
him
of
his
wife
ended
a
few
days
thence
concluded
that
nothing
could
be
known
at
pavia
of
his
condition
and
held
it
for
certain
that
the
lady
must
have
married
again
wherefore
he
fell
into
such
a
chagrin
that
he
lost
sleep
and
appetite
and
taking
to
his
bed
determined
to
die
when
saladin
who
loved
him
above
all
heard
of
this
he
came
to
him
and
having
by
dint
of
many
and
urgent
prayers
learned
the
cause
of
his
grief
and
his
sickness
upbraided
him
sore
for
that
he
had
not
before
told
it
to
him
and
after
besought
him
to
be
comforted
assuring
him
that
if
he
would
but
take
heart
he
would
so
contrive
that
he
should
be
in
pavia
at
the
appointed
term
and
told
him
how
messer
torello
putting
faith
in
saladin
words
and
having
many
a
time
heard
say
that
this
was
possible
and
had
indeed
been
often
enough
done
began
to
take
comfort
and
pressed
saladin
to
despatch
the
soldan
accordingly
charged
a
nigromancer
of
his
of
whose
skill
he
had
aforetime
made
proof
to
cast
about
for
a
means
whereby
messer
torello
should
be
in
one
night
transported
upon
a
bed
to
pavia
to
which
the
magician
replied
that
it
should
be
done
but
that
for
the
gentleman
own
weal
he
must
put
him
to
sleep
this
done
saladin
returned
to
messer
torello
and
finding
him
altogether
resolved
to
seek
at
any
hazard
to
be
in
pavia
at
the
term
appointed
if
it
were
possible
and
in
default
thereof
to
die
bespoke
him
thus
torello
god
knoweth
that
i
neither
will
nor
can
anywise
blame
you
if
you
tenderly
love
your
lady
and
are
fearful
of
her
becoming
another
for
that
of
all
the
women
i
ever
saw
she
it
is
whose
manners
whose
fashions
and
whose
demeanour
leaving
be
her
beauty
which
is
but
a
flower
appear
to
me
most
worthy
to
be
commended
and
held
dear
it
had
been
very
grateful
to
me
since
fortune
hath
sent
you
hither
that
we
should
have
passed
together
as
equal
masters
in
the
governance
of
this
my
realm
such
time
as
you
and
i
have
to
live
and
if
this
was
not
to
be
vouchsafed
me
of
god
it
being
fated
that
you
should
take
it
to
heart
to
seek
either
to
die
or
to
find
yourself
in
pavia
at
the
appointed
term
i
should
above
all
have
desired
to
know
it
in
time
that
i
might
have
you
transported
to
your
house
with
such
honour
such
magnificence
and
in
such
company
as
your
worth
meriteth
however
since
this
hath
not
been
vouchsafed
and
you
desire
to
be
presently
there
i
will
as
i
may
despatch
you
thither
after
the
fashion
whereof
i
have
bespoken
you
lord
replied
messer
torello
acts
without
your
words
have
given
me
sufficient
proof
of
your
favour
which
i
have
never
merited
in
such
supreme
degree
and
of
that
which
you
say
though
you
had
not
said
it
i
shall
live
and
die
most
assured
but
since
i
have
taken
this
resolve
i
pray
you
that
that
which
you
tell
me
you
will
do
may
be
done
speedily
for
that
is
the
last
day
i
am
to
be
looked
for
saladin
answered
that
this
should
without
fail
be
accomplished
and
accordingly
on
the
morrow
meaning
to
send
him
away
that
same
night
he
let
make
in
a
great
hall
of
his
palace
a
very
goodly
and
rich
bed
of
mattresses
all
according
to
their
usance
of
velvet
and
cloth
of
gold
and
caused
lay
thereon
a
counterpoint
curiously
wrought
in
various
figures
with
great
pearls
and
jewels
of
great
price
the
which
here
in
italy
was
after
esteemed
an
inestimable
treasure
and
two
pillows
such
as
sorted
with
a
bed
of
that
fashion
this
done
he
bade
invest
messer
torello
who
was
presently
well
and
strong
again
in
a
gown
of
the
saracen
fashion
the
richest
and
goodliest
thing
that
had
ever
been
seen
of
any
and
wind
about
his
head
after
their
guise
one
of
his
longest
then
it
growing
late
he
betook
himself
with
many
of
his
barons
to
the
chamber
where
messer
torello
was
and
seating
himself
well
nigh
weeping
by
his
side
bespoke
him
thus
torello
the
hour
draweth
near
that
is
to
sunder
me
from
you
and
since
i
may
not
bear
you
company
nor
cause
you
to
be
accompanied
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
the
journey
you
have
to
make
which
suffereth
it
not
needs
must
i
take
leave
of
you
here
in
this
chamber
to
which
end
i
am
come
hither
wherefore
ere
i
commend
you
to
god
i
conjure
you
by
that
love
and
that
friendship
that
is
between
us
that
you
remember
you
of
me
and
if
it
be
possible
ere
our
times
come
to
an
end
that
whenas
you
have
ordered
your
affairs
in
lombardy
you
come
at
the
least
once
to
see
me
to
the
end
that
what
while
i
am
cheered
by
your
sight
i
may
then
supply
the
default
which
needs
must
i
presently
commit
by
reason
of
your
haste
and
against
that
betide
let
it
not
irk
you
to
visit
me
with
letters
and
require
me
of
such
things
as
shall
please
you
for
that
of
a
surety
i
will
more
gladly
do
them
for
you
than
for
any
man
alive
footnote
it
may
be
well
to
remind
the
european
reader
that
the
turban
consists
of
two
parts
a
and
a
linen
cloth
which
is
wound
round
it
in
various
folds
and
shapes
to
form
the
eastern
as
for
messer
torello
he
could
not
contain
his
tears
wherefore
being
hindered
thereby
he
answered
in
a
few
words
that
it
was
impossible
his
benefits
and
his
nobility
should
ever
escape
his
mind
and
that
he
would
without
fail
do
that
which
he
enjoined
him
whenas
occasion
should
be
afforded
him
whereupon
saladin
having
tenderly
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
bade
him
with
many
tears
god
speed
and
departed
the
chamber
the
other
barons
then
all
took
leave
of
him
and
followed
the
soldan
into
the
hall
where
he
had
caused
make
ready
the
bed
meanwhile
it
waxing
late
and
the
nigromant
awaiting
and
pressing
for
despatch
there
came
a
physician
to
messer
torello
with
a
draught
and
making
him
believe
that
he
gave
it
him
to
fortify
him
caused
him
drink
it
nor
was
it
long
ere
he
fell
asleep
and
so
by
commandment
was
carried
into
the
hall
and
laid
upon
the
bed
aforesaid
whereon
the
soldan
placed
a
great
and
goodly
crown
of
great
price
and
inscribed
it
on
such
wise
that
it
was
after
manifestly
understood
to
be
sent
by
him
to
messer
torello
lady
after
which
he
put
on
torello
finger
a
ring
wherein
was
a
carbuncle
enchased
so
resplendent
that
it
seemed
a
lighted
flambeau
the
value
whereof
could
scarce
be
reckoned
and
girt
him
with
a
sword
whose
garniture
might
not
lightly
be
appraised
moreover
he
let
hang
a
fermail
on
his
breast
wherein
were
pearls
whose
like
were
never
seen
together
with
other
precious
stones
galore
and
on
his
either
side
he
caused
set
two
great
basins
of
gold
full
of
doubloons
and
many
strings
of
pearls
and
rings
and
girdles
and
other
things
which
it
were
tedious
to
recount
round
about
him
this
done
he
kissed
him
once
more
and
bade
the
nigromant
despatch
whereupon
in
his
presence
the
bed
was
incontinent
taken
away
messer
torello
and
all
and
saladin
abode
devising
of
him
with
his
barons
meanwhile
messer
torello
had
been
set
down
even
as
he
had
requested
in
the
church
of
san
pietro
in
ciel
at
pavia
with
all
the
jewels
and
ornaments
aforesaid
and
yet
slept
when
matins
having
sounded
the
sacristan
of
the
church
entered
with
a
light
in
his
hand
and
chancing
suddenly
to
espy
the
rich
bed
not
only
marvelled
but
seized
with
a
terrible
fright
turned
and
fled
the
abbot
and
the
monks
seeing
him
flee
marvelled
and
questioned
him
of
the
cause
which
he
told
them
whereupon
quoth
the
abbot
thou
art
no
child
nor
art
thou
new
to
the
church
that
thou
shouldst
thus
lightly
take
fright
let
us
go
see
who
hath
played
the
bugbear
with
thee
accordingly
kindling
several
lights
the
abbot
and
all
his
monks
entered
the
church
and
saw
that
and
goodly
bed
and
thereon
the
gentleman
asleep
and
what
while
misdoubting
and
fearful
they
gazed
upon
the
noble
jewels
without
drawing
anywise
near
to
the
bed
it
befell
that
the
virtue
of
the
draught
being
spent
messer
torello
awoke
and
heaved
a
great
sigh
which
when
the
monks
saw
and
heard
they
took
to
flight
abbot
and
all
affrighted
and
crying
aid
us
messer
torello
opened
his
eyes
and
looking
about
him
plainly
perceived
himself
to
be
whereas
he
had
asked
saladin
to
have
him
carried
at
which
he
was
mightily
content
then
sitting
up
he
particularly
examined
that
which
he
had
about
him
and
for
all
he
had
before
known
of
the
magnificence
of
saladin
it
seemed
to
him
now
greater
and
he
knew
it
more
nevertheless
without
moving
farther
seeing
the
monks
flee
and
divining
why
he
proceeded
to
call
the
abbot
by
name
praying
him
be
not
afraid
for
that
he
was
torello
his
nephew
the
abbot
hearing
this
waxed
yet
more
fearful
as
holding
him
as
dead
many
months
before
but
after
awhile
taking
assurance
by
true
arguments
and
hearing
himself
called
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
went
up
to
him
whereupon
quoth
messer
torello
now
father
mine
of
what
are
you
adread
godamercy
i
am
alive
and
returned
hither
from
beyond
seas
the
abbot
for
all
he
had
a
great
beard
and
was
clad
after
the
saracen
fashion
presently
recognized
him
and
altogether
reassured
took
him
by
the
hand
saying
son
thou
art
welcome
back
then
he
continued
must
not
marvel
at
our
affright
for
that
there
is
not
a
man
in
these
parts
but
firmly
believeth
thee
to
be
dead
insomuch
that
i
must
tell
thee
that
madam
adalieta
thy
wife
overmastered
by
the
prayers
and
threats
of
her
kinsfolk
and
against
her
own
will
is
married
again
and
is
this
morning
to
go
to
her
new
husband
ay
and
the
and
all
that
pertaineth
unto
the
nuptial
festivities
is
prepared
therewithal
messer
torello
arose
from
off
the
rich
bed
and
greeting
the
abbot
and
the
monks
with
marvellous
joyance
prayed
them
all
to
speak
with
none
of
that
his
return
against
he
should
have
despatched
an
occasion
of
his
after
which
having
caused
lay
up
the
costly
jewels
in
safety
he
recounted
to
his
uncle
all
that
had
befallen
him
up
to
that
moment
the
abbot
rejoiced
in
his
happy
fortunes
and
together
with
him
rendered
thanks
to
god
after
which
messer
torello
asked
him
who
was
his
lady
new
husband
the
abbot
told
him
and
torello
said
have
a
mind
ere
folk
know
of
my
return
to
see
what
manner
countenance
is
that
of
my
wife
in
these
nuptials
wherefore
albeit
it
is
not
the
usance
of
men
of
your
habit
to
go
to
entertainments
of
this
kind
i
would
have
you
contrive
for
the
love
of
me
that
we
may
go
thither
you
and
i
the
abbot
replied
that
he
would
well
and
accordingly
as
soon
as
it
was
day
he
sent
to
the
new
bridegroom
saying
that
he
would
fain
be
at
his
nuptials
with
a
friend
of
his
whereto
the
gentleman
answered
that
it
liked
him
passing
well
accordingly
come
messer
torello
clad
as
he
was
repaired
with
his
uncle
to
the
bridegroom
house
beheld
with
wonderment
of
all
who
saw
him
but
recognized
of
none
and
the
abbot
told
every
one
that
he
was
a
saracen
sent
ambassador
from
the
soldan
to
the
king
of
france
he
was
therefore
seated
at
a
table
right
overagainst
his
lady
whom
he
beheld
with
the
utmost
pleasure
and
himseemed
she
was
troubled
in
countenance
at
these
new
nuptials
she
in
her
turn
looked
whiles
upon
him
but
not
of
any
cognizance
that
she
had
of
him
for
that
his
great
beard
and
outlandish
habit
and
the
firm
assurance
she
had
that
he
was
dead
hindered
her
thereof
presently
whenas
it
seemed
to
him
time
to
essay
if
she
remembered
her
of
him
he
took
the
ring
she
had
given
him
at
his
parting
and
calling
a
lad
who
served
before
her
said
to
him
to
the
bride
on
my
part
that
it
is
the
usance
in
my
country
whenas
any
stranger
such
as
i
am
here
eateth
at
the
of
any
lady
like
herself
that
she
in
token
that
she
holdeth
him
welcome
at
her
table
send
him
the
cup
wherein
she
drinketh
full
of
wine
whereof
after
the
stranger
hath
drunken
what
he
will
the
cup
being
covered
again
the
bride
drinketh
the
rest
the
page
did
his
errand
to
the
lady
who
like
a
and
discreet
woman
as
she
was
believing
him
to
be
some
great
gentleman
commanded
to
show
him
that
she
had
his
coming
in
gree
that
a
great
gilded
cup
which
stood
before
her
should
be
washed
and
filled
with
wine
and
carried
to
the
gentleman
and
so
it
was
done
messer
torello
taking
her
ring
in
his
mouth
contrived
in
drinking
to
drop
it
unseen
of
any
into
the
cup
wherein
having
left
but
a
little
wine
he
covered
it
again
and
despatched
it
to
the
lady
madam
adalieta
taking
the
cup
and
uncovering
it
that
she
might
accomplish
his
usance
set
it
to
her
mouth
and
seeing
the
ring
considered
it
awhile
without
saying
aught
then
knowing
it
for
that
which
she
had
given
to
messer
torello
at
parting
she
took
it
up
and
looking
fixedly
upon
him
whom
she
deemed
a
stranger
presently
recognized
him
whereupon
as
she
were
waxen
mad
she
overthrew
the
table
she
had
before
her
and
cried
out
saying
is
my
lord
it
is
indeed
messer
torello
then
running
to
the
place
where
he
sat
she
cast
herself
as
far
forward
as
she
might
without
taking
thought
to
her
clothes
or
to
aught
that
was
on
the
table
and
clipped
him
close
in
her
arms
nor
could
for
word
or
deed
of
any
there
be
loosed
from
his
neck
till
she
was
bidden
of
messer
torello
contain
herself
somewhat
for
that
time
enough
would
yet
be
afforded
her
to
embrace
him
she
accordingly
having
arisen
and
the
nuptials
being
by
this
all
troubled
albeit
in
part
more
joyous
than
ever
for
the
recovery
of
such
a
gentleman
every
one
at
messer
torello
request
abode
quiet
whereupon
he
related
to
them
all
that
had
betided
him
from
the
day
of
his
departure
up
to
that
moment
concluding
that
the
gentleman
who
deeming
him
dead
had
taken
his
lady
to
wife
must
not
hold
it
ill
if
he
being
alive
took
her
again
unto
himself
the
bridegroom
though
somewhat
mortified
answered
frankly
and
as
a
friend
that
it
rested
with
himself
to
do
what
most
pleased
him
of
his
own
accordingly
the
lady
put
off
the
ring
and
crown
had
of
her
new
groom
and
donned
the
ring
which
she
had
taken
from
the
cup
and
the
crown
sent
her
by
the
soldan
then
issuing
forth
of
the
house
where
they
were
they
betook
themselves
with
all
the
nuptial
train
to
messer
torello
house
and
there
recomforted
his
disconsolate
friends
and
kindred
and
all
the
townsfolk
who
regarded
his
return
as
well
nigh
a
miracle
with
long
and
joyous
festival
as
for
messer
torello
after
imparting
of
his
precious
jewels
to
him
who
had
had
the
expense
of
the
nuptials
as
well
as
to
the
abbot
and
many
others
and
signifying
his
happy
repatriation
by
more
than
one
message
to
saladin
whose
friend
and
servant
he
still
professed
himself
he
lived
many
years
thereafterward
with
his
noble
lady
and
thenceforth
used
more
hospitality
and
courtesy
than
ever
such
then
was
the
issue
of
the
troubles
of
messer
torello
and
his
beloved
lady
and
the
recompense
of
their
cheerful
and
ready
hospitalities
the
which
many
study
to
practise
who
albeit
they
have
the
wherewithal
do
yet
so
ill
contrive
it
that
they
make
those
on
whom
they
bestow
their
courtesies
buy
them
ere
they
have
done
with
them
for
more
than
their
worth
wherefore
if
no
reward
ensue
to
them
thereof
neither
themselves
nor
others
should
marvel
thereat
the
tenth
story
day
the
tenth
the
marquess
of
saluzzo
constrained
by
the
prayers
of
his
vassals
to
marry

determined

after
his
own

taketh
to

the
daughter
of
a
peasant
and
hath
of
her
two
children
whom
he
maketh
believe
to
her
to
put
to
death
after
which
feigning
to
be
grown
weary
of
her
and
to
have
taken
another
wife
he
letteth
bring
his
own
daughter
home
to
his
house
as
she
were
his
new
bride
and
turneth
his
wife
away
in
her
shift
but
finding
her
patient
under
everything
he
fetcheth
her
home
again
dearer
than
ever
and
showing
her
her
children
grown
great
honoureth
and
letteth
honour
her
as

ended

looked
that
night
to
abase
the
phantom
tail
upright
had
not
given
a
brace
of
farthings
of
all
the
praises
that
you
bestow
on
messer
torello
then
knowing
that
it
rested
with
him
alone
to
tell
he
proceeded
gentle
ladies
mine
it
appeareth
to
me
that
this
day
hath
been
given
up
to
kings
and
soldans
and
the
like
folk
wherefore
that
i
may
not
remove
overfar
from
you
i
purpose
to
relate
to
you
of
a
marquess
not
an
act
of
magnificence
but
a
monstrous
folly
which
albeit
good
ensued
to
him
thereof
in
the
end
i
counsel
not
any
to
imitate
for
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
weal
betided
him
thereof
footnote
he
who
was
to
have
married
madam
adalieta
footnote
see
p
it
is
now
a
great
while
agone
since
the
chief
of
the
house
among
the
marquesses
of
saluzzo
was
a
youth
called
gualtieri
who
having
neither
wife
nor
children
spent
his
time
in
nought
but
hunting
and
hawking
nor
had
any
thought
of
taking
a
wife
nor
of
having
children
wherein
he
deserved
to
be
reputed
very
wise
the
thing
however
not
pleasing
his
vassals
they
besought
him
many
times
to
take
a
wife
so
he
might
not
abide
without
an
heir
nor
they
without
a
lord
and
offered
themselves
to
find
him
one
of
such
a
fashion
and
born
of
such
parents
that
good
hopes
might
be
had
of
her
and
he
be
well
content
with
her
whereto
he
answered
friends
you
constrain
me
unto
that
which
i
was
altogether
resolved
never
to
do
considering
how
hard
a
thing
it
is
to
find
a
wife
whose
fashions
sort
well
within
one
own
humour
and
how
great
an
abundance
there
is
of
the
contrary
sort
and
how
dour
a
life
is
his
who
happeneth
upon
a
woman
not
well
suited
unto
him
to
say
that
you
think
by
the
manners
and
fashions
of
the
parents
to
know
the
daughters
wherefrom
you
argue
to
give
me
a
wife
such
as
will
please
me
is
a
folly
since
i
know
not
whence
you
may
avail
to
know
their
fathers
nor
yet
the
secrets
of
their
mothers
and
even
did
you
know
them
daughters
are
often
unlike
their
parents
however
since
it
pleaseth
you
to
bind
me
in
these
chains
i
am
content
to
do
your
desire
but
that
i
may
not
have
occasion
to
complain
of
other
than
myself
if
it
prove
ill
done
i
mean
to
find
a
wife
for
myself
certifying
you
that
whomsoever
i
may
take
me
if
she
be
not
honoured
of
you
as
your
lady
and
mistress
you
shall
prove
to
your
cost
how
much
it
irketh
me
to
have
at
your
entreaty
taken
a
wife
against
mine
own
will
the
good
honest
men
replied
that
they
were
content
so
he
would
but
bring
himself
to
take
a
wife
now
the
fashions
of
a
poor
girl
who
was
of
a
village
near
to
his
house
had
long
pleased
gualtieri
and
himseeming
she
was
fair
enough
he
judged
that
he
might
lead
a
very
comfortable
life
with
her
wherefore
without
seeking
farther
he
determined
to
marry
her
and
sending
for
her
father
who
was
a
very
poor
man
agreed
with
him
to
take
her
to
wife
this
done
he
assembled
all
his
friends
of
the
country
round
and
said
to
them
friends
it
hath
pleased
and
pleaseth
you
that
i
should
dispose
me
to
take
a
wife
and
i
have
resigned
myself
thereto
more
to
complease
you
than
of
any
desire
i
have
for
marriage
you
know
what
you
promised
me
to
wit
that
you
would
be
content
with
and
honour
as
your
lady
and
mistress
her
whom
i
should
take
whosoever
she
might
be
wherefore
the
time
is
come
when
i
am
to
keep
my
promise
to
you
and
when
i
would
have
you
keep
yours
to
me
i
have
found
a
damsel
after
mine
own
heart
and
purpose
within
some
few
days
hence
to
marry
her
and
bring
her
home
to
my
house
wherefore
do
you
bethink
yourselves
how
the
may
be
a
goodly
one
and
how
you
may
receive
her
with
honour
on
such
wise
that
i
may
avouch
myself
contented
of
your
promise
even
as
you
will
have
cause
to
be
of
mine
the
good
folk
all
answered
joyfully
that
this
liked
them
well
and
that
be
she
who
he
would
they
would
hold
her
for
lady
and
mistress
and
honour
her
as
such
in
all
things
after
which
they
all
addressed
themselves
to
hold
fair
and
high
and
glad
festival
and
on
like
wise
did
gualtieri
who
let
make
ready
very
great
and
goodly
nuptials
and
bade
thereto
many
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
and
great
gentlemen
and
others
of
the
neighbourhood
moreover
he
let
cut
and
fashion
store
of
rich
and
goodly
apparel
after
the
measure
of
a
damsel
who
seemed
to
him
like
of
her
person
to
the
young
woman
he
was
purposed
to
marry
and
provided
also
rings
and
girdles
and
a
rich
and
goodly
crown
and
all
that
behoveth
unto
a
bride
the
day
come
that
he
had
appointed
for
the
nuptials
gualtieri
towards
half
tierce
mounted
to
horse
he
and
all
those
who
were
come
to
do
him
honour
and
having
ordered
everything
needful
quoth
he
is
time
to
go
fetch
the
bride
then
setting
out
with
all
his
company
he
rode
to
the
village
and
betaking
himself
to
the
house
of
the
girl
father
found
her
returning
in
great
haste
with
water
from
the
spring
so
she
might
after
go
with
other
women
to
see
bride
come
when
the
marquess
saw
her
he
called
her
by
name
to
wit
griselda
and
asked
her
where
her
father
was
to
which
she
answered
bashfully
lord
he
is
within
the
house
thereupon
gualtieri
dismounted
and
bidding
all
await
him
entered
the
poor
house
alone
where
he
found
her
father
whose
name
was
giannucolo
and
said
to
him
am
come
to
marry
griselda
but
first
i
would
fain
know
of
her
somewhat
in
thy
presence
accordingly
he
asked
her
if
an
he
took
her
to
wife
she
would
still
study
to
please
him
nor
take
umbrage
at
aught
that
he
should
do
or
say
and
if
she
would
be
obedient
and
many
other
like
things
to
all
of
which
she
answered
ay
whereupon
gualtieri
taking
her
by
the
hand
led
her
forth
and
in
the
presence
of
all
his
company
and
of
every
one
else
let
strip
her
naked
then
sending
for
the
garments
which
he
had
let
make
he
caused
forthright
clothe
and
shoe
her
and
would
have
her
set
the
crown
on
her
hair
all
tumbled
as
it
was
after
which
all
marvelling
at
this
he
said
this
is
she
who
i
purpose
shall
be
my
wife
an
she
will
have
me
to
husband
then
turning
to
her
where
she
stood
all
shamefast
and
confounded
he
said
to
her
wilt
thou
have
me
to
thy
husband
to
which
she
answered
my
lord
quoth
he
i
will
have
thee
to
my
wife
and
espoused
her
in
the
presence
of
all
then
mounting
her
on
a
palfrey
he
carried
her
honourably
accompanied
to
his
mansion
where
the
nuptials
were
celebrated
with
the
utmost
splendour
and
rejoicing
no
otherwise
than
as
he
had
taken
to
wife
the
king
daughter
of
france
the
young
wife
seemed
to
have
together
with
her
clothes
changed
her
mind
and
her
manners
she
was
as
we
have
already
said
goodly
of
person
and
countenance
and
even
as
she
was
fair
on
like
wise
she
became
so
engaging
so
pleasant
and
so
that
she
seemed
rather
to
have
been
the
child
of
some
noble
gentleman
than
the
daughter
of
giannucolo
and
a
tender
of
sheep
whereof
she
made
every
one
marvel
who
had
known
her
aforetime
moreover
she
was
so
obedient
to
her
husband
and
so
diligent
in
his
service
that
he
accounted
himself
the
happiest
and
best
contented
man
in
the
world
and
on
like
wise
she
bore
herself
with
such
graciousness
and
such
loving
kindness
towards
her
husband
subjects
that
there
was
none
of
them
but
loved
and
honoured
her
with
his
whole
heart
praying
all
for
her
welfare
and
prosperity
and
advancement
and
whereas
they
were
used
to
say
that
gualtieri
had
done
as
one
of
little
wit
to
take
her
to
wife
they
now
with
one
accord
declared
that
he
was
the
sagest
and
man
alive
for
that
none
other
than
he
might
ever
have
availed
to
know
her
high
worth
hidden
as
it
was
under
poor
clothes
and
a
rustic
habit
brief
it
was
no
great
while
ere
she
knew
so
to
do
that
not
only
in
her
husband
marquisate
but
everywhere
else
she
made
folk
talk
of
her
virtues
and
her
and
turned
to
the
contrary
whatsoever
had
been
said
against
her
husband
on
her
account
whenas
he
married
her
she
had
not
long
abidden
with
gualtieri
ere
she
conceived
with
child
and
in
due
time
bore
a
daughter
whereat
he
rejoiced
greatly
but
a
little
after
a
new
thought
having
entered
his
mind
to
wit
to
seek
by
dint
of
long
tribulation
and
things
unendurable
to
make
trial
of
her
patience
he
first
goaded
her
with
words
feigning
himself
troubled
and
saying
that
his
vassals
were
exceeding
ill
content
with
her
by
reason
of
her
mean
extraction
especially
since
they
saw
that
she
bore
children
and
that
they
did
nothing
but
murmur
being
sore
chagrined
for
the
birth
of
her
daughter
the
lady
hearing
this
replied
without
anywise
changing
countenance
or
showing
the
least
distemperature
lord
do
with
me
that
which
thou
deemest
will
be
most
for
thine
honour
and
solace
for
that
i
shall
be
content
with
all
knowing
as
i
do
that
i
am
of
less
account
than
they
and
that
i
was
unworthy
of
this
dignity
to
which
thou
hast
advanced
me
of
thy
courtesy
this
reply
was
mighty
agreeable
to
gualtieri
for
that
he
saw
she
was
not
uplifted
into
aught
of
pridefulness
for
any
honour
that
himself
or
others
had
done
her
but
a
little
after
having
in
general
terms
told
her
that
his
vassals
could
not
brook
this
girl
that
had
been
born
of
her
he
sent
to
her
a
of
his
whom
he
had
lessoned
and
who
said
to
her
with
a
very
woeful
countenance
an
i
would
not
die
needs
must
i
do
that
which
my
lord
commandeth
me
he
hath
bidden
me
take
this
your
daughter
and
and
said
no
more
the
lady
hearing
this
and
seeing
the
aspect
and
remembering
her
of
her
husband
words
concluded
that
he
had
enjoined
him
put
the
child
to
death
whereupon
without
changing
countenance
albeit
she
felt
a
sore
anguish
at
heart
she
straightway
took
her
from
the
cradle
and
having
kissed
and
blessed
her
laid
her
in
the
servant
arms
saying
her
and
punctually
do
that
which
thy
lord
hath
enjoined
thee
but
leave
her
not
to
be
devoured
of
the
beasts
and
the
birds
except
he
command
it
thee
the
servant
took
the
child
and
reported
that
which
the
lady
had
said
to
gualtieri
who
marvelled
at
her
constancy
and
despatched
him
with
the
child
to
a
kinswoman
of
his
at
bologna
praying
her
to
bring
her
up
and
rear
her
diligently
without
ever
saying
whose
daughter
she
was

strange

his
vassals
in
course
of
time
the
lady
again
conceived
and
in
due
season
bore
a
male
child
to
her
husband
great
joy
but
that
which
he
had
already
done
sufficing
him
not
he
addressed
himself
to
probe
her
to
the
quick
with
a
yet
sorer
stroke
and
accordingly
said
to
her
one
day
with
a
troubled
air
since
thou
hast
borne
this
male
child
i
have
nowise
been
able
to
live
in
peace
with
these
my
people
so
sore
do
they
murmur
that
a
grandson
of
giannucolo
should
become
their
lord
after
me
wherefore
i
misdoubt
me
an
i
would
not
be
driven
forth
of
my
domains
it
will
behove
me
do
in
this
case
that
which
i
did
otherwhen
and
ultimately
put
thee
away
and
take
another
wife
the
lady
gave
ear
to
him
with
a
patient
mind
nor
answered
otherwhat
then
lord
study
to
content
thyself
and
to
satisfy
thy
pleasure
and
have
no
thought
of
me
for
that
nothing
is
dear
to
me
save
in
so
much
as
i
see
it
please
thee
not
many
days
after
gualtieri
sent
for
the
son
even
as
he
had
sent
for
the
daughter
and
making
a
like
show
of
having
him
put
to
death
despatched
him
to
bologna
there
to
be
brought
up
even
as
he
had
done
with
the
girl
but
the
lady
made
no
other
countenance
nor
other
words
thereof
than
she
had
done
of
the
girl
whereat
gualtieri
marvelled
sore
and
affirmed
in
himself
that
no
other
woman
could
have
availed
to
do
this
that
she
did
and
had
he
not
seen
her
tender
her
children
with
the
utmost
fondness
what
while
it
pleased
him
he
had
believed
that
she
did
this
because
she
recked
no
more
of
them
whereas
in
effect
he
knew
that
she
did
it
of
her
discretion
his
vassals
believing
that
he
had
caused
put
the
children
to
death
blamed
him
sore
accounting
him
a
barbarous
man
and
had
the
utmost
compassion
of
his
wife
who
never
answered
otherwhat
to
the
ladies
who
condoled
with
her
for
her
children
thus
slain
than
that
that
which
pleased
him
thereof
who
had
begotten
them
pleased
her
also
at
last
several
years
being
passed
since
the
birth
of
the
girl
gualtieri
deeming
it
time
to
make
the
supreme
trial
of
her
endurance
declared
in
the
presence
of
his
people
that
he
could
no
longer
endure
to
have
griselda
to
wife
and
that
he
perceived
that
he
had
done
ill
and
boyishly
in
taking
her
wherefore
he
purposed
as
far
as
in
him
lay
to
make
interest
with
the
pope
to
grant
him
a
dispensation
so
he
might
put
her
away
and
take
another
wife
for
this
he
was
roundly
taken
to
task
by
many
men
of
worth
but
answered
them
nothing
save
that
needs
must
it
be
so
the
lady
hearing
these
things
and
herseeming
she
must
look
to
return
to
her
father
house
and
maybe
tend
sheep
again
as
she
had
done
aforetime
what
while
she
saw
another
woman
in
possession
of
him
to
whom
she
willed
all
her
weal
sorrowed
sore
in
herself
but
yet
even
as
she
had
borne
the
other
affronts
of
fortune
so
with
a
firm
countenance
she
addressed
herself
to
bear
this
also
gualtieri
no
great
while
after
let
come
to
him
from
rome
counterfeit
letters
of
dispensation
and
gave
his
vassals
to
believe
that
the
pope
had
thereby
licensed
him
to
take
another
wife
and
leave
griselda
then
sending
for
the
latter
he
said
to
her
in
presence
of
many
by
concession
made
me
of
the
pope
i
am
free
to
take
another
wife
and
put
thee
away
and
accordingly
for
that
mine
ancestors
have
been
great
gentlemen
and
lords
of
this
country
whilst
thine
have
still
been
husbandmen
i
mean
that
thou
be
no
more
my
wife
but
that
thou
return
to
giannucolo
his
house
with
the
dowry
which
thou
broughtest
me
and
i
will
after
bring
hither
another
wife
for
that
i
have
found
one
more
sorted
to
myself
the
lady
hearing
this
contained
her
tears
contrary
to
the
nature
of
woman
though
not
without
great
unease
and
answered
lord
i
ever
knew
my
mean
estate
to
be
nowise
sortable
with
your
nobility
and
for
that
which
i
have
been
with
you
i
have
still
confessed
myself
indebted
to
you
and
to
god
nor
have
i
ever
made
nor
held
it
mine
as
given
to
me
but
have
still
accounted
it
but
as
a
loan
it
pleaseth
you
to
require
it
again
and
it
must
and
doth
please
me
to
restore
it
to
you
here
is
your
ring
wherewith
you
espoused
me
take
it
you
bid
me
carry
away
with
me
that
dowry
which
i
brought
hither
which
to
do
you
will
need
no
paymaster
and
i
neither
purse
nor
packhorse
for
i
have
not
forgotten
that
you
had
me
naked
and
if
you
account
it
seemly
that
this
my
body
wherein
i
have
carried
children
begotten
of
you
be
seen
of
all
i
will
begone
naked
but
i
pray
you
in
requital
of
my
maidenhead
which
i
brought
hither
and
bear
not
hence
with
me
that
it
please
you
i
may
carry
away
at
the
least
one
sole
shift
over
and
above
my
dowry
gualtieri
who
had
more
mind
to
weep
than
to
otherwhat
natheless
kept
a
stern
countenance
and
said
be
it
carry
away
a
shift
as
many
as
stood
around
besought
him
to
give
her
a
gown
so
that
she
who
had
been
thirteen
years
and
more
his
wife
should
not
be
seen
go
forth
of
his
house
on
such
mean
and
shameful
wise
as
it
was
to
depart
in
her
shift
but
their
prayers
all
went
for
nothing
wherefore
the
lady
having
commended
them
to
god
went
forth
his
house
in
her
shift
barefoot
and
nothing
on
her
head
and
returned
to
her
father
followed
by
the
tears
and
lamentations
of
all
who
saw
her
giannucolo
who
had
never
been
able
to
believe
it
true
that
gualtieri
should
entertain
his
daughter
to
wife
and
went
in
daily
expectation
of
this
event
had
kept
her
the
clothes
which
she
had
put
off
the
morning
that
gualtieri
had
married
her
and
now
brought
them
to
her
whereupon
she
donned
them
and
addressed
herself
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
to
the
little
offices
of
her
father
house
enduring
the
cruel
onslaught
of
hostile
fortune
with
a
stout
heart
gualtieri
having
done
this
gave
out
to
his
people
that
he
had
chosen
a
daughter
of
one
of
the
counts
of
panago
and
letting
make
great
preparations
for
the
nuptials
sent
for
griselda
to
come
to
him
and
said
to
her
am
about
to
bring
home
this
lady
whom
i
have
newly
taken
to
wife
and
mean
at
this
her
first
coming
to
do
her
honour
thou
knowest
i
have
no
women
about
me
who
know
how
to
array
me
the
rooms
nor
to
do
a
multitude
of
things
that
behove
unto
such
a
festival
wherefore
do
thou
who
art
better
versed
than
any
else
in
these
household
matters
order
that
which
is
to
do
here
and
let
bid
such
ladies
as
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
and
receive
them
as
thou
wert
mistress
here
then
when
the
nuptials
are
ended
thou
mayst
begone
back
to
thy
house
albeit
these
words
were
all
daggers
to
heart
who
had
been
unable
to
lay
down
the
love
she
bore
him
as
she
had
laid
down
her
fair
fortune
she
replied
lord
i
am
ready
and
willing
then
in
her
coarse
homespun
clothes
entering
the
house
whence
she
had
a
little
before
departed
in
her
shift
she
fell
to
sweeping
and
ordering
the
chambers
and
letting
place
hangings
and
about
the
saloons
and
make
ready
the
viands
putting
her
hand
to
everything
as
she
were
some
paltry
of
the
house
nor
ever
gave
over
till
she
had
arrayed
and
ordered
everything
as
it
behoved
thereafter
having
let
invite
all
the
ladies
of
the
country
on
gualtieri
part
she
awaited
the
day
of
the
festival
which
being
come
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
the
spirit
and
bearing
of
a
lady
of
high
degree
for
all
she
had
mean
clothes
on
her
back
she
received
all
the
ladies
who
came
thither
meanwhile
gualtieri
who
had
caused
the
two
children
be
diligently
reared
in
bologna
by
his
kinswoman
who
was
married
to
a
gentleman
of
the
panago
family
the
girl
being
now
twelve
years
old
and
the
fairest
creature
that
ever
was
seen
and
the
boy

had
sent
to
his
kinsman
at
bologna
praying
him
be
pleased
to
come
to
saluzzo
with
his
son
and
daughter
and
take
order
to
bring
with
him
a
goodly
and
honourable
company
and
bidding
him
tell
every
one
that
he
was
carrying
him
the
young
lady
to
his
wife
without
otherwise
discovering
to
any
aught
of
who
she
was
the
gentleman
did
as
the
marquess
prayed
him
and
setting
out
with
the
girl
and
boy
and
a
goodly
company
of
gentlefolk
after
some
days
journey
arrived
about
at
saluzzo
where
he
found
all
the
countryfolk
and
many
others
of
the
neighbourhood
awaiting
gualtieri
new
bride
the
latter
being
received
by
the
ladies
and
come
into
the
saloon
where
the
tables
were
laid
griselda
came
to
meet
her
clad
as
she
was
and
accosted
her
blithely
saying
and
fair
welcome
to
my
lady
thereupon
the
ladies
who
had
urgently
but
in
vain
besought
gualtieri
to
suffer
griselda
to
abide
in
a
chamber
or
lend
her
one
of
the
gowns
that
had
been
hers
so
that
she
might
not
go
thus
before
his
guests
were
seated
at
table
and
it
was
proceeded
to
serve
them
the
girl
was
eyed
by
every
one
and
all
declared
that
gualtieri
had
made
a
good
exchange
and
among
the
rest
griselda
commended
her
amain
both
her
and
her
young
brother
footnote
the
husband
of
his
kinswoman
aforesaid
gualtieri
perceiving
that
the
strangeness
of
the
case
in
no
wise
changed
her
and
being
assured
that
this
proceeded
not
from
lack
of
understanding
for
that
he
knew
her
to
be
very
quick
of
wit
himseemed
he
had
now
seen
fully
as
much
as
he
desired
of
his
lady
patience
and
he
judged
it
time
to
deliver
her
from
the
bitterness
which
he
doubted
not
she
kept
hidden
under
her
constant
countenance
wherefore
calling
her
to
himself
he
said
to
her
smiling
in
the
presence
of
every
one
deemest
thou
of
our
bride
lord
answered
she
deem
exceeding
well
of
her
and
if
as
i
believe
she
is
as
discreet
as
she
is
fair
i
doubt
not
a
whit
but
you
will
live
the
happiest
gentleman
in
the
world
with
her
but
i
beseech
you
as
most
i
may
that
you
inflict
not
on
her
those
pangs
which
you
inflicted
whilere
on
her
who
was
sometime
yours
for
methinketh
she
might
scarce
avail
to
endure
them
both
because
she
is
younger
and
because
she
hath
been
delicately
reared
whereas
the
other
had
been
in
continual
fatigues
from
a
little
child
thereupon
gualtieri
seeing
she
firmly
believed
that
the
young
lady
was
to
be
his
wife
nor
therefore
spoke
anywise
less
than
well
seated
her
by
his
side
and
said
to
her
it
is
now
time
that
thou
reap
the
fruits
of
thy
long
patience
and
that
those
who
have
reputed
me
cruel
and
unjust
and
brutish
should
know
that
this
which
i
have
done
i
wrought
to
an
end
aforeseen
willing
to
teach
thee
to
be
a
wife
and
to
show
them
how
to
take
and
use
one
and
at
the
same
time
to
beget
myself
perpetual
quiet
what
while
i
had
to
live
with
thee
the
which
whenas
i
came
to
take
a
wife
i
was
sore
afraid
might
not
betide
me
and
therefore
to
make
proof
thereof
i
probed
and
afflicted
thee
after
such
kind
as
thou
knowest
and
meseeming
for
that
i
have
never
perceived
that
either
in
word
or
in
deed
hast
thou
departed
from
my
pleasure
that
i
have
of
thee
that
solace
which
i
desired
i
purpose
presently
to
restore
thee
at
one
stroke
that
which
i
took
from
thee
at
many
and
to
requite
thee
with
a
supreme
delight
the
pangs
i
have
inflicted
on
thee
wherefore
with
a
joyful
heart
take
this
whom
thou
deemest
my
bride
and
her
brother
for
thy
children
and
mine
for
these
be
they
whom
thou
and
many
others
have
long
accounted
me
to
have
barbarously
let
put
to
death
and
i
am
thy
husband
who
loveth
thee
over
all
else
believing
i
may
vaunt
me
that
there
is
none
else
who
can
be
so
content
of
his
wife
as
can
i
so
saying
he
embraced
her
and
kissed
her
then
rising
up
he
betook
himself
with
griselda
who
wept
for
joy
whereas
the
daughter
hearing
these
things
sat
all
stupefied
and
tenderly
embracing
her
and
her
brother
undeceived
her
and
many
others
who
were
there
thereupon
the
ladies
arose
from
table
overjoyed
and
withdrew
with
griselda
into
a
chamber
where
with
happier
augury
pulling
off
her
mean
attire
they
clad
her
anew
in
a
magnificent
dress
of
her
own
and
brought
her
again
to
the
saloon
as
a
gentlewoman
which
indeed
she
appeared
even
in
rags
there
she
rejoiced
in
her
children
with
joy
and
all
being
overjoyed
at
this
happy
issue
they
redoubled
in
feasting
and
merrymaking
and
prolonged
the
festivities
several
days
accounting
gualtieri
a
very
wise
man
albeit
they
held
the
trials
which
he
had
made
of
his
lady
overharsh
nay
intolerable
but
over
all
they
held
griselda
most
sage
the
count
of
panago
returned
after
some
days
to
bologna
and
gualtieri
taking
giannucolo
from
his
labour
placed
him
in
such
estate
as
befitted
his
so
that
he
lived
in
honour
and
great
solace
and
so
ended
his
days
whilst
he
himself
having
nobly
married
his
daughter
lived
long
and
happily
with
griselda
honouring
her
as
most
might
be
what
more
can
here
be
said
save
that
even
in
poor
cottages
there
rain
down
divine
spirits
from
heaven
like
as
in
princely
palaces
there
be
those
who
were
worthier
to
tend
swine
than
to
have
lordship
over
men
who
but
griselda
could
with
a
countenance
not
only
dry
but
cheerful
have
endured
the
barbarous
and
unheard
proofs
made
by
gualtieri
which
latter
had
not
belike
been
ill
requited
had
he
happened
upon
one
who
when
he
turned
her
out
of
doors
in
her
shift
had
let
jumble
her
furbelows
of
another
to
such
purpose
that
a
fine
gown
had
come
of
it
footnote
unwetted
with
tears
dioneo
story
being
finished
and
the
ladies
having
discoursed
amain
thereof
some
inclining
to
one
side
and
some
to
another
this
blaming
one
thing
and
that
commending
it
the
king
lifting
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
seeing
that
the
sun
was
now
low
and
the
hour
of
vespers
at
hand
proceeded
without
arising
from
session
to
speak
thus
charming
ladies
as
i
doubt
not
you
know
the
understanding
of
mortals
consisteth
not
only
in
having
in
memory
things
past
and
taking
cognizance
of
things
present
but
in
knowing
by
means
of
the
one
and
the
other
of
these
to
forecast
things
future
is
reputed
by
men
of
mark
to
consist
the
greatest
wisdom
as
you
know
it
will
be
fifteen
days
since
we
departed
florence
to
take
some
diversion
for
the
preservation
of
our
health
and
of
our
lives
eschewing
the
woes
and
dolours
and
miseries
which
since
this
pestilential
season
began
are
continually
to
be
seen
about
our
city
this
to
my
judgment
we
have
well
and
honourably
done
for
that
an
i
have
known
to
see
aright
albeit
merry
stories
and
belike
incentive
to
concupiscence
have
been
told
here
and
we
have
continually
eaten
and
drunken
well
and
danced
and
sung
and
made
music
all
things
apt
to
incite
weak
minds
to
things
less
seemly
i
have
noted
no
act
no
word
in
fine
nothing
blameworthy
either
on
your
part
or
on
that
of
us
men
nay
meseemeth
i
have
seen
and
felt
here
a
continual
decency
an
unbroken
concord
and
a
constant
fraternal
familiarity
the
which
at
once
for
your
honour
and
service
and
for
mine
own
is
certes
most
pleasing
to
me
lest
however
for
overlong
usance
aught
should
grow
thereof
that
might
issue
in
tediousness
and
that
none
may
avail
to
cavil
at
our
overlong
tarriance
each
of
us
moreover
having
had
his
or
her
share
of
the
honour
that
yet
resideth
in
myself
i
hold
it
meet
an
it
be
your
pleasure
that
we
now
return
whence
we
came
more
by
token
that
if
you
consider
aright
our
company
already
known
to
several
others
of
the
neighbourhood
may
multiply
after
a
fashion
that
will
deprive
us
of
our
every
commodity
wherefore
if
you
approve
my
counsel
i
will
retain
the
crown
conferred
on
me
until
our
departure
which
i
purpose
shall
be
morning
but
should
you
determine
otherwise
i
have
already
in
mind
whom
i
shall
invest
withal
for
the
ensuing
day
much
was
the
debate
between
the
ladies
and
the
young
men
but
ultimately
they
all
took
the
king
counsel
for
useful
and
seemly
and
determined
to
do
as
he
proposed
whereupon
calling
the
seneschal
he
bespoke
him
of
the
manner
which
he
should
hold
on
the
ensuing
morning
and
after
having
dismissed
the
company
until
he
rose
to
his
feet
the
ladies
and
the
young
men
following
his
example
gave
themselves
this
to
one
kind
of
diversion
and
that
to
another
no
otherwise
than
of
their
wont
and
come
they
betook
themselves
to
table
with
the
utmost
pleasure
and
after
fell
to
singing
and
carolling
and
making
music
presently
lauretta
leading
up
a
dance
the
king
bade
fiammetta
sing
a
song
whereupon
she
very
blithely
proceeded
to
sing
thus
if
love
came
but
withouten
jealousy
i
know
no
lady
born
so
blithe
as
i
were
she
be
if
gladsome
youthfulness
in
a
fair
lover
might
content
a
maid
virtue
and
worth
discreet
valiance
or
gentilesse
wit
and
sweet
speech
and
fashions
all
arrayed
in
pleasantness
complete
certes
i
she
for
whose
behoof
these
meet
in
one
for
all
these
in
him
who
is
my
hope
i
see
but
for
that
i
perceive
that
other
women
are
as
wise
as
i
i
tremble
for
affright
and
tending
to
believe
the
worst
in
others
the
desire
espy
of
him
who
steals
my
spright
thus
this
that
is
my
good
and
chief
delight
enforceth
me
forlorn
sigh
sore
and
live
in
dole
and
misery
if
i
knew
fealty
such
in
him
my
lord
as
i
know
merit
there
i
were
not
jealous
i
but
here
is
seen
so
much
lovers
to
tempt
how
true
they
be
i
hold
all
false
whereby
i
all
disconsolate
and
fain
would
die
of
each
with
doubting
torn
who
eyes
him
lest
she
bear
him
off
from
me
be
then
each
lady
prayed
by
god
that
she
in
this
be
not
intent
me
to
do
amiss
for
sure
if
any
maid
should
or
with
words
or
becks
or
blandishment
my
detriment
in
this
seek
or
procure
and
if
i
ywis
be
all
my
charms
forsworn
but
i
will
make
her
rue
it
bitterly
no
sooner
had
fiammetta
made
an
end
of
her
song
than
dioneo
who
was
beside
her
said
laughing
madam
you
would
do
a
great
courtesy
to
let
all
the
ladies
know
who
he
is
lest
you
be
ousted
of
his
possession
through
ignorance
since
you
would
be
so
sore
incensed
thereat
after
this
divers
other
songs
were
sung
and
the
night
being
now
well
nigh
half
spent
they
all
by
the
king
commandment
betook
themselves
to
repose
as
the
new
day
appeared
they
arose
and
the
seneschal
having
already
despatched
all
their
gear
in
advance
they
returned
under
the
guidance
of
their
discreet
king
to
florence
where
the
three
young
men
took
leave
of
the
seven
ladies
and
leaving
them
in
santa
maria
novella
whence
they
had
set
out
with
them
went
about
their
other
pleasures
whilst
the
ladies
whenas
it
seemed
to
them
time
returned
to
their
houses
here
endeth
the
tenth
and
last
day
of
the
decameron
of
the
most
noble
damsels
for
whose
solace
i
have
addressed
myself
to
so
long
a
labour
i
have
now
methinketh
with
the
aid
of
the
divine
favour
vouchsafed
me
as
i
deem
for
your
pious
prayers
and
not
for
my
proper
merits
throughly
accomplished
that
which
i
engaged
at
the
beginning
of
this
present
work
to
do
wherefore
returning
thanks
first
to
god
and
after
to
you
it
behoveth
to
give
rest
to
my
pen
and
to
my
tired
hand
which
ere
i
accord
them
i
purpose
briefly
to
reply
as
to
objections
tacitly
broached
to
certain
small
matters
that
may
peradventure
be
alleged
by
some
one
of
you
or
by
others
since
meseemeth
very
certain
that
these
stories
have
no
especial
privilege
more
than
other
things
nay
i
mind
me
to
have
shown
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
day
that
they
have
none
such
there
are
peradventure
some
of
you
who
will
say
that
i
have
used
overmuch
license
in
inditing
these
stories
as
well
as
in
making
ladies
whiles
say
and
very
often
hearken
to
things
not
very
seemly
either
to
be
said
or
heard
of
modest
women
this
i
deny
for
that
there
is
nothing
so
unseemly
as
to
be
forbidden
unto
any
one
so
but
he
express
it
in
seemly
terms
as
meseemeth
indeed
i
have
here
very
aptly
done
but
let
us
suppose
that
it
is
so
for
that
i
mean
not
to
plead
with
you
who
would
overcome
me
i
say
that
many
reasons
very
readily
offer
themselves
in
answer
why
i
have
done
this
firstly
if
there
be
aught
thereof
in
any
of
them
the
nature
of
the
stories
required
it
the
which
an
they
be
considered
with
the
rational
eye
of
a
person
of
understanding
it
will
be
abundantly
manifest
that
i
could
not
have
otherwise
recounted
an
i
would
not
altogether
disfeature
them
and
if
perchance
there
be
therein
some
tittle
some
wordlet
or
two
freer
maybe
than
liketh
your
squeamish
hypocritical
prudes
who
weigh
words
rather
than
deeds
and
study
more
to
appear
than
to
be
good
i
say
that
it
should
no
more
be
forbidden
me
to
write
them
than
it
is
commonly
forbidden
unto
men
and
women
to
say
all
day
long
and
and
and
and
and
and
all
manner
like
things
without
reckoning
that
no
less
liberty
should
be
accorded
to
my
pen
than
is
conceded
to
the
brush
of
the
limner
who
without
any
or
at
the
least
any
just
reprehension
maketh
let
be
michael
smite
the
serpent
with
sword
or
spear
and
george
the
dragon
whereas
it
pleaseth
them
but
adam
male
and
eve
female
and
affixeth
to
the
cross
whiles
with
one
nail
and
whiles
with
two
the
feet
of
him
himself
who
willed
for
the
salvation
of
the
human
race
to
die
upon
the
rood
moreover
it
is
eath
enough
to
see
that
these
things
are
spoken
not
in
the
church
of
the
affairs
whereof
it
behoveth
to
speak
with
a
mind
and
in
terms
alike
of
the
chastest
albeit
among
its
histories
there
are
tales
enough
to
be
found
of
anothergates
fashion
than
those
written
by
me
nor
yet
in
the
schools
of
philosophy
where
decency
is
no
less
required
than
otherwhere
nor
among
churchmen
or
philosophers
anywhere
but
amidst
gardens
in
a
place
of
pleasance
and
diversion
and
among
men
and
women
though
young
yet
of
mature
wit
and
not
to
be
led
astray
by
stories
at
a
time
when
it
was
not
forbidden
to
the
most
virtuous
to
go
for
their
own
preservation
with
their
breeches
on
their
heads
again
such
as
they
are
these
stories
like
everything
else
can
both
harm
and
profit
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
listener
who
knoweth
not
that
wine
though
according
to
cinciglione
and
scolajo
and
many
others
an
excellent

people
in
health

whoso

the
welfare
of
those
who
desire
to
live
in
peace
and

oftentimes
slay
men
not
of
any
malice
of
their
own
but
of
the
perversity
of
those
who
use
them
wrongfully

which

not

be
minded
to
draw
therefrom
ill
counsel
or
ill
practice
they
will
nowise
forbid
it
him

perchance
they
have
it
in
them
or
be
strained
and
twisted
into
having
it
and
who
so
will
have
profit
and
utility
thereof
they
will
not
deny
it
him
nor
will
they
be
ever
styled
or
accounted
other
than
useful
and
seemly
if
they
be
read
at
those
times
and
to
those
persons
for
which
and
for
whom
they

been
recounted
whoso
hath

lit
living
folk
there
be
some
ladies
also
who
will
say
that
there
are
some
stories
here
which
had
been
better
away
granted
but
i
could
not
nor
should
write
aught
save
those
actually
related
wherefore
those
who
told

should
have
told

goodly

goodly

if
folk
will
pretend
that
i
am
both
the

writer
thereof
which
i

not
i
say
that
i
should
not
take
shame
to
myself
that

therein
or
nettles

thistles

somewhat
of
briers

might
be
found
mingled
with
the
better
herbs
besides
having
to
speak
to
simple
lasses
such

the

it

folly

to

very

whoso

offend

branded
upon

that
which
they
hold
hidden

again
i
doubt
not
but
there
be
those
who
will
say
that
some
of
them
are
overlong
to
whom
i
say
again
that
whoso
hath
overwhat
to
do
doth
folly
to
read
these
stories
even

they
were
brief

it
hath
not
therefor
escaped
my

unto
whoso

nothing

that
as
none
of
you
goeth
to
athens
or
bologna
or
paris
to
study
it
behoveth
to
speak
to
you
more
at
large
than
to
those
who
have
had
their
wits
whetted
by
study
again
i
doubt
not
a
jot
but
there
be
yet
some
of
you
who
will
say
that
the
things
aforesaid
are
full
of
quips
and
cranks
and
quodlibets
and
that
it
ill
beseemeth
a
man
of
weight
and
gravity
to
have
written
thus
to
these
i
am
bound
to
render
and
do
render
thanks
for
that
moved
by
a
virtuous
jealousy
they
are
so
tender
of
my
fame
but
to
their
objection
i
reply
on
this
wise
i
confess
to
being
a
man
of
weight
and
to
have
been
often
weighed
in
my
time
wherefore
speaking
to
those
ladies
who
have
not
weighed
me
i
declare
that
i
am
not
heavy
nay
i
am
so
light
that
i
abide
like
a
nutgall
in
water
and
considering
that
the
preachments
made
of
friars
to
rebuke
men
of
their
sins
are
nowadays
for
the
most
part
seen
full
of
quips
and
cranks
and
gibes
i
conceived
that
these
latter
would
not
sit
amiss
in
my
stories
written
to
ease
women
of
melancholy
algates
an
they
should
laugh
overmuch
on
that
account
the
lamentations
of
jeremiah
the
passion
of
our
saviour
and
the
complaint
of
mary
magdalen
will
lightly
avail
to
cure
them
thereof
again
who
can
doubt
but
there
will
to
boot
be
found
some
to
say
that
i
have
an
ill
tongue
and
a
venomous
for
that
i
have
in
sundry
places
written
the
truth
anent
the
friars
to
those
who
shall
say
thus
it
must
be
forgiven
since
it
is
not
credible
that
they
are
moved
by
other
than
just
cause
for
that
the
friars
are
a
good
sort
of
folk
who
eschew
unease
for
the
love
of
god
and
who
grind
with
a
full
head
of
water
and
tell
no
tales
and
but
that
they
all
savour
somewhat
of
the
their
commerce
would
be
far
more
agreeable
natheless
i
confess
that
the
things
of
this
world
have
no
stability
and
are
still
on
the
change
and
so
may
it
have
befallen
of
my
tongue
the
which
not
to
trust
to
mine
own
judgment
which
i
eschew
as
most
i
may
in
my
affairs
a
of
mine
told
me
not
long
since
was
the
best
and
sweetest
in
the
world
and
in
good
sooth
were
this
the
case
there
had
been
few
of
the
foregoing
stories
to
write
but
for
that
those
who
say
thus
speak
despitefully
i
will
have
that
which
hath
been
said
suffice
them
for
a
reply
wherefore
leaving
each
of
you
henceforth
to
say
and
believe
as
seemeth
good
to
her
it
is
time
for
me
to
make
an
end
of
words
humbly
thanking
him
who
hath
after
so
long
a
labour
brought
us
with
his
help
to
the
desired
end
and
you
charming
ladies
abide
you
in
peace
with
his
favour
remembering
you
of
me
if
perchance
it
profit
any
of
you
aught
to
have
read
these
stories
here
endeth
the
book
called
decameron

surnamed
