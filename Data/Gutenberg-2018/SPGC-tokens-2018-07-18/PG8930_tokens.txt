introduction
sassoon
the
man
in
appearance
he
is
tall
loosely
built
he
is
pale
or
with
a
flush
has
a
heavy
jaw
wide
mouth
with
the
upper
lip
slightly
protruding
and
the
curve
of
it
very
pronounced
like
that
of
a
shrivelled
leaf
as
i
have
noticed
is
common
in
many
poets
his
nose
is
aquiline
the
nostrils
being
wide
and
heavily
arched
this
characteristic
and
the
fullness
depth
and
heat
of
his
dark
eyes
give
him
the
air
of
a
sullen
falcon
he
speaks
slowly
enunciating
the
words
as
if
they
pained
him
in
a
voice
that
has
something
of
the
troubled
thickness
apparent
in
the
voices
of
those
who
emerge
from
a
deep
grief
as
he
speaks
his
large
hands
roughened
by
trench
toil
and
by
riding
wander
aimlessly
until
some
emotion
grips
him
when
the
knuckles
harden
and
he
clutches
at
his
knees
or
at
the
edge
of
the
table
and
all
the
while
he
will
be
breathing
hard
like
a
man
who
has
swum
a
distance
when
he
reads
his
poems
he
chants
and
one
would
think
that
he
communed
with
himself
save
that
at
the
pauses
he
shoots
a
powerful
glance
at
the
listener
between
the
poems
he
is
still
but
moves
his
lips
he
likes
best
to
speak
of
hunting
he
will
shout
of
it
of
open
air
mornings
when
the
gorse
alone
flames
brighter
than
the
sky
of
country
quiet
of
his
mother
footnote
his
father
was
a
country
gentleman
of
stock
his
mother
an
english
woman
a
miss
thornycroft
sister
of
the
sculptor
of
that
name
of
poetry
usually
shelley
masefield
and
thomas
hardy
and
last
and
chiefly
but
always
with
a
rapid
tumbling
enunciation
and
a
desperate
air
filled
with
pain
of
soldiers
for
the
incubus
of
war
is
on
him
so
that
his
days
are
shot
with
anguish
and
his
nights
with
horror
he
is
years
old
was
educated
at
marlborough
and
christchurch
oxford
was
a
master
of
and
is
a
captain
in
the
royal
welsh
fusiliers
thrice
he
has
fought
in
france
and
once
in
palestine
behind
his
name
are
set
the
letters
since
he
has
won
the
military
cross
for
an
act
of
valour
which
went
near
to
securing
him
a
higher
honour
sassoon
the
poet
the
poetry
of
siegfried
sassoon
divides
itself
into
two
rough
classes
the
idyllic
and
the
satiric
war
has
defiled
one
to
produce
the
other
at
heart
siegfried
sassoon
is
an
idealist
before
the
war
he
had
hardly
published
a
line
he
spent
his
summers
in
the
company
of
books
at
the
piano
on
expeditions
and
in
playing
tennis
during
winter
he
hunted
hunting
was
a
greater
passion
with
him
than
poetry
much
of
his
poetry
celebrated
the
loveliness
of
the
field
as
seen
by
the
huntsman
in
the
early
morning
light
but
few
probably
guessed
that
the
youth
known
to
excel
in
field
sports
excelled
also
in
poetry
for
in
its
way
this
early
poetry
does
excel
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
nearly
every
little
book
he
then
wrote
was
privately
printed
poetry
was
for
him
just
something
for
private
and
particular
enjoyment
like
a
ride
alone
before
breakfast
among
these
privately
printed
books
are
twelve
sonnets
melodies
an
ode
for
music
hyacinth
all
the
names
are
significant
he
was
occupied
with
natural
beauty
and
with
music
in
he
publishes
in
a
limited
and
obscure
edition
apollo
in
doelyrium
wherein
it
seems
that
he
is
beginning
to
find
a
certain
want
of
body
and
basis
in
his
poems
made
of
beautiful
words
about
beautiful
objects
later
in
the
same
year
with
masefield
everlasting
mercy
widow
in
the
bye
sheet
and
daffodil
fields
before
him
he
starts
to
write
a
parody
of
these
uncouth
intrusions
of
the
sorrows
of
obscure
persons
into
his
paradise
but
half
way
through
the
poem
adopts
the
masefield
manner
in
earnest

i
had
this
from
his
own
mouth
and
finishes
by
unsuccessfully
endeavouring
to
rival

master

the
war
breaks
out
home
on
leave
in
he
privately
prints
discoveries
a
little
book
which
contains
some
of
the
loveliest
of
his
poems
in
the
change
has
come
he
can
hardly
believe
it
himself
glory
privately
printed
includes
four
war
poems
he
has
not
definitely
turned
to
his
later
style
but
he
hovers
on
the
brink
the
war
is
beginning
to
pain
him
the
poems
victory
and
dragon
and
the
undying
show
him
turning
toward
his
paradise
to
see
if
its
beauty
can
save
him
the
year

the
publication
of
the
old
huntsman
footnote
old
huntsman
dutton
this
book
secured
instantaneous
success
siegfried
sassoon
on
its
publication
became
one
of
the
leading
young
poets
of
england
the
book
begins
with
the
long
monologue
of
a
retired
huntsman
a
piece
of
remarkable
characterisation
it
continues
with
all
the
best
of
the
poems
including
the
loveliest
in
and
glory
there
are
also
the
poems
between
his
old
manner
and
his
new
such
as
the
victory
mentioned
above
but
interspersed
among
the
paradise
poems
are
the
first
poems
in
his
final
war
style
he
tells
the
story
of
the
change
in
a
characteristic
manner
conscripts

old
huntsman
for
like
nearly
every
one
of
the
young
english
poets
he
is
to
some
extent
a
humourist
his
humour
is
not
however
even
through
old
huntsman
all
of
such
a
wise
and
gentle
tenor
he
breaks
out
into
lively
bitterness
in
such
poems
as
tombstone

conscripts

that
awkward
squad

and

marching
up

i
drilled
them
till
they

raucous

his
lute
away
and

fall

they
looked
at
me
reproachful
how
i
longed
to
set
them
free
i
gave
them
lectures
on
defence
attack
they
fidgeted
and
shuffled
yawned
and
sighed
and
boggled
at
my
questions
joy
was
slack
and
wisdom
gnawed
his
fingers
young
fancy
how
i
loved
him
all
the
while
stared
at
his
with
a
rueful
smile
their
training
done
i
shipped
them
all
to
france
where
most
of
those
i
loved
too
well
got
killed
rapture
and
pale
enchantment
and
romance
and
many
a
sickly
slender
lord
who
filled
my
soul
long
since
with
litanies
of
sin
went
home
because
they
could
stand
the
din
but
the
kind
common
ones
that
i
despised
hardly
a
man
of
them
i
count
as
friend
what
virtues
they
disguised
they
stood
and
played
the
hero
to
the
end
won
gold
and
silver
medals
bright
with
bars
and
marched
resplendent

stars
this
book
in
consequence
almost
wholly
of
these
bitter
poems
enjoyed
a
remarkable
success
with
the
soldiers
fighting
in
france
one
met
it
everywhere
hello
you
know
siegfried
sassoon
then
do
you
well
tell
him
from
me
that
the
more
he
lays
it
on
thick
to
those
who
do
realize
the
war
the
better
the
stuff
we
want
we
fed
up
with
the
old
stunt
in
appeared
attack
here
there
is
hardly
a
trace
of
the
feeling
you
ca
even
think
of
paradise
when
in
hell
for
sassoon
was
now
well
along
the
way
of
thorns
how
many
lives
had
he
not
seen
spilled
apparently
to
no
purpose
did
not
the
fact
of
war
arch
him
in
like
a
dirty
sky
he
breaks
out
almost
like
a
mad
man
into
imprecations
into
vehement
tirades
into
sarcasms
ironies
the
hellish
laughters
that
arise
from
a
heart
that
is
not
broken
once
for
all
but
that
is
newly
broken
every
day
while
the
monster
that
devours
the
lives
of
the
young
continues
its
ravages
take
for
instance
the
magnificent
any
dead
officer
written
just
before
america
entered
the
war
many
reading
this
poem
would
think
great
britain
was
going
to
cease
fighting
but
nothing
of
the
sort
one
must
always
remember
that
bitter
as
these
imprecations
are
against
those
who
mismanaged
certain
episodes
in
the
war
the
ultimate
foe
is
not
they
but
the
german
junkers
who
planned
this
war
for
forty
years
who
have
given
the
lovely
earth
over
to
hideous
defilement
and
the
youths
of
all
nations
to
carnage
sometimes
in
this
book
sassoon
fails
to
express
himself
properly
this
fact
is
i
think
a
tribute
to
his
sincerity
for
his
earlier
work
very
clearly
displays
his
technical
proficiency
but
here
what
can
he
do
indignation
chokes
and
strangles
him
he
claws
often
enough
at
unsatisfactory
words
dislocates
his
sentences
tumbles
out
his
images
as
if
he
would
pulp
the
makers
of
war
beneath
them
very
rarely
does
he
attain
to
the
poignant
simplicity
of
hawthorn
tree
or
the
detached
irony
of
it
matter
can
he
then
see
nothing
else
in
war
i
remember
him
once
turning
to
me
and
saying
suddenly
apropos
of
certain
exalté
poems
in
my
and
endurances
i
see
all
that
and
i
agree
with
you
robert
war
has
made
me
i
think
i
am
a
man
now
as
well
as
a
poet
you
have
said
the
things
well
enough
now
let
us
nevermore
say
another
word
of
whatever
little
may
be
good
in
war
for
the
individual
who
has
a
heart
to
be
steeled
i
remember
i
nodded
for
further
acquaintance
with
war
inclines
me
to
his
opinion
no
one
ever
he
continued
henceforth
say
a
word
in
any
way
countenancing
war
it
is
dangerous
even
to
speak
of
how
here
and
there
the
individual
may
gain
some
hardship
of
soul
by
it
for
war
is
hell
and
those
who
institute
it
are
criminals
were
there
anything
to
say
for
it
it
should
not
be
said
for
its
spiritual
disasters
far
outweigh
any
of
its
advantages
for
myself
this
is
the
truth
war
does
ennoble
it
degrades
the
words
of
barbusse
placed
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
should
be
engraved
over
the
doors
of
every
war
office
of
every
state
in
the
world
while
war
is
a
possibility
man
is
little
better
than
a
savage
and
civilisation
the
mere
moments
of
rest
between
a
succession
of
nightmares
it
is
to
help
to
end
this
horror
that
siegfried
sassoon
and
the
many
others
who
feel
like
him
have
continued
to
fight
as
after
the
publication
of
this
book
he
fought
in
palestine
and
in
france
you
civilized
persons
who
read
this
book
not
only
as
a
poet
but
as
a
soldier
i
beg
of
you
not
to
turn
from
it
read
it
again
and
again
till
its
words
become
part
of
your
consciousness
it
was
written
by
a
man
for
sake
that
which
is
humane
might
no
more
be
an
empty
phrase
that
the
words
of
blake
might
blossom
to
a
new
meaning

art

no

gloom
shudders

drizzling

reveals
disconsolate
men
who
stamp
their
sodden

turn
dulled
sunken
faces
to
the
sky
haggard

they
who
have
beaten
down

of
night
must
now
renew
their
desolation

truce

dawn
murdering
the
livid
hours

grope

peace

these
who
cling
to
life
with
stubborn
hands
can
grin
through
storms
of
death
and
find
a
gap
in
the
clawed
cruel
tangles
of
his
defence

march
from
safety
and
the
joy
of
thickets
to
the
land
where
all
is
ruin
and
nothing
blossoms
but
the
sky
that
hastens
over
them
where
they
endure
sad
smoking
flat
horizons
reeking
woods
and
foundered
volleying
doom
for
doom
o
my
brave
brown
companions
when
your
souls
flock
silently
away
and
the
eyeless
dead
shame
the
wild
beast
of
battle
on
the
ridge
death
will
stand
grieving
in
that
field
of
war
since
your
unvanquished
hardihood
is
spent
and
through
some
mooned
valhalla
there
will
pass
battalions
and
battalions
scarred
from
hell
the
unreturning
army
that
was
youth
the
legions
who
have
suffered
and
are
dust
we
gained
our
first
objective

before
while
dawn
broke
like
a
face
with
blinking
eyes
pallid
unshaved
and
thirsty
blind
with
smoke
things
seemed
all
right
at
first
we
held
their
line
with
bombers
posted
lewis
guns
well
placed
and
clink
of
shovels
deepening
the
shallow
trench
the
place
was
rotten
with
dead
green
clumsy
legs
sprawled
and
grovelled
along
the
saps
and
trunks
face
downward
in
the
sucking
mud
wallowed
like
trodden
loosely
filled
and
naked
sodden
buttocks
mats
of
hair
bulged
clotted
heads
slept
in
the
plastering
slime
and
then
the
rain
began
the
jolly
old
rain
a
yawning
soldier
knelt
against
the
bank
staring
across
the
morning
blear
with
fog
he
wondered
when
the
allemands
would
get
busy
and
then
of
course
they
started
with
traversing
sure
as
fate
and
never
a
dud
mute
in
the
clamour
of
shells
he
watched
them
burst
spouting
dark
earth
and
wire
with
gusts
from
hell
while
posturing
giants
dissolved
in
drifts
of
smoke
he
crouched
and
flinched
dizzy
with
galloping
fear
sick
for
escape
loathing
the
strangled
horror
and
butchered
frantic
gestures
of
the
dead
an
officer
came
blundering
down
the
trench
and
man
the
on
he
went
gasping
and
bawling
then
the
haze
lifted
bombing
on
the
right
down
the
old
sap
on
the
left
and
stumbling
figures
looming
out
in
front
o
christ
they
coming
at
us
bullets
spat
and
he
remembered
his
rifle
rapid
fire
and
started
blazing
wildly
then
a
bang
crumpled
and
spun
him
sideways
knocked
him
out
to
grunt
and
wriggle
none
heeded
him
he
choked
and
fought
the
flapping
veils
of
smothering
gloom
lost
in
a
blurred
confusion
of
yells
and
groans
down
and
down
and
down
he
sank
and
drowned
bleeding
to
death
the
had

the
hindenburg
line
april
groping
along
the
tunnel
step
by
step
he
winked
his
prying
torch
with
patching
glare
from
side
to
side
and
sniffed
the
unwholesome
air
tins
boxes
bottles
shapes
too
vague
to
know
a
mirror
smashed
the
mattress
from
a
bed
and
he
exploring
fifty
feet
below
the
rosy
gloom
of
battle
overhead
tripping
he
grabbed
the
wall
saw
some
one
lie
humped
at
his
feet
by
a
rug
and
stooped
to
give
the
sleeper
arm
a
tug
i
looking
for

for
days
he
had
no

up
and

me
through
this
stinking
place
savage
he
kicked
a
soft
unanswering
heap
and
flashed
his
beam
across
the
livid
face
terribly
glaring
up
whose
eyes
yet
wore
agony
dying
hard
ten
days
before
and
fists
of
fingers
clutched
a
blackening
wound
alone
he
staggered
on
until
he
found
dawn
ghost
that
filtered
down
a
shafted
stair
to
the
dazed
muttering
creatures
underground
who
hear
the
boom
of
shells
in
muffled
sound
at
last
with
sweat
of
horror
in
his
hair
he
climbed
through
darkness
to
the
twilight
air
unloading
hell
behind
him
step
by
step
wirers
pass
it
along
the
wiring
party
going
out
and
yawning
sentries
mumble
wirers
going
out
unravelling
twisting
hammering
stakes
with
muffled
thud
they
toil
with
stealthy
haste
and
anger
in
their
blood
the
boche
sends
up
a
flare
black
forms
stand
rigid
there
like
posts
then
darkness
and
the
clumsy
ghosts
stride
hither
and
thither
whispering
tripped
by
clutching
snare
of
snags
and
tangles
ghastly
dawn
with
vaporous
coasts
gleams
desolate
along
the
sky
night
misery
ended
young
hughes
was
badly
hit
i
heard
him
carried
away
moaning
at
every
lurch
no
doubt
he
die
but
can
say
the
wire
been
safely
mended
attack
at
dawn
the
ridge
emerges
massed
and
dun
in
the
wild
purple
of
the
glowering
sun
smouldering
through
spouts
of
drifting
smoke
that
shroud
the
menacing
scarred
slope
and
one
by
one
tanks
creep
and
topple
forward
to
the
wire
the
barrage
roars
and
lifts
then
clumsily
bowed
with
bombs
and
guns
and
shovels
and
men
jostle
and
climb
to
meet
the
bristling
fire
lines
of
grey
muttering
faces
masked
with
fear
they
leave
their
trenches
going
over
the
top
while
time
ticks
blank
and
busy
on
their
wrists
and
hope
with
furtive
eyes
and
grappling
fists
flounders
in
mud
o
jesu
make
it
stop
dreamers
soldiers
are
citizens
of
death
grey
land
drawing
no
dividend
from
time
in
the
great
hour
of
destiny
they
stand
each
with
his
feuds
and
jealousies
and
sorrows
soldiers
are
sworn
to
action
they
must
win
some
flaming
fatal
climax
with
their
lives
soldiers
are
dreamers
when
the
guns
begin
they
think
of
firelit
homes
clean
beds
and
wives
i
see
them
in
foul
gnawed
by
rats
and
in
the
ruined
trenches
lashed
with
rain
dreaming
of
things
they
did
with
balls
and
bats
and
mocked
by
hopeless
longing
to
regain
and
picture
shows
and
spats
and
going
to
the
office
in
the
train
how
to
die
dark
clouds
are
smouldering
into
red
while
down
the
craters
morning
burns
the
dying
soldier
shifts
his
head
to
watch
the
glory
that
returns
he
lifts
his
fingers
toward
the
skies
where
holy
brightness
breaks
in
flame
radiance
reflected
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
lips
a
whispered
name
you
think
to
hear
some
people
talk
that
lads
go
west
with
sobs
and
curses
and
sullen
faces
white
as
chalk
hankering
for
wreaths
and
tombs
and
hearses
but
they
been
taught
the
way
to
do
it
like
christian
soldiers
not
with
haste
and
shuddering
groans
but
passing
through
it
with
due
regard
for
decent
taste
the
effect
the
effect
of
our
bombardment
was
terrific
one
man
told
me
he
had
never
seen
so
many
dead
before
he
never
seen
so
many
dead
before
they
sprawled
in
yellow
daylight
while
he
swore
and
gasped
and
lugged
his
everlasting
load
of
bombs
along
what
once
had
been
a
road
how
peaceful
are
the
dead
who
put
that
silly
gag
in
some
one
head
he
never
seen
so
many
dead
before
the
lilting
words
danced
up
and
down
his
brain
while
corpses
jumped
and
capered
in
the
rain
no
no
he
would
count
them
any
more
the
dead
have
done
with
pain
they
choked
they
ca
come
back
to
life
again
when
dick
was
killed
last
week
he
looked
like
that
flapping
along
the
like
a
fish
after
the
blazing
crump
had
knocked
him
flat
how
many
dead
as
many
as
ever
you
wish
do
count
they
too
many
who
buy
my
nice
fresh
corpses
two
a
penny
twelve
months
after
hullo
here
my
platoon
the
lot
i
had
last
year
the
war
be
over
soon
what
no
bloody
fear
then
number
seven
all
present
and
correct
they
standing
in
the
sun
impassive
and
erect
young
gibson
with
his
grin
and
morgan
tired
and
white
jordan
who
out
to
win
a
some
night
and
hughes
that
keen
on
wiring
and
davies
who
always
must
be
firing
at
the
boche
front
line
old
soldiers
never
die
they
simply
fide
that
what
they
used
to
sing
along
the
roads
last
spring
that
what
they
used
to
say
before
the
push
began
that
where
they
are
knocked
over
to
a
man
the
fathers
snug
at
the
club
two
fathers
sat
gross
and
full
of
chat
one
of
them
said
my
eldest
lad
writes
cheery
letters
from
bagdad
but
arthur
getting
all
the
fun
at
arras
with
his
gun
yes
wheezed
the
other
that
the
luck
my
boy
quite
stuck
in
england
training
all
this
year
still
if
there
truth
in
what
we
hear
the
huns
intend
to
ask
for
more
before
they
bolt
across
the
rhine
i
watched
them
toddle
through
the
door
these
impotent
old
friends
of
mine
base
details
if
i
were
fierce
and
bald
and
short
of
breath
i
live
with
scarlet
majors
at
the
base
and
speed
glum
heroes
up
the
line
to
death
you
see
me
with
my
puffy
petulant
face
guzzling
and
gulping
in
the
best
hotel
reading
the
roll
of
honour
poor
young
chap
i
say
i
used
to
know
his
father
well
yes
we
lost
heavily
in
this
last
scrap
and
when
the
war
is
done
and
youth
stone
dead
i
toddle
safely
home
and
die
in
bed
the
general
the
general
said
when
we
met
him
last
week
on
our
way
to
the
line
now
the
soldiers
he
smiled
at
are
most
of
dead
and
we
cursing
his
staff
for
incompetent
swine
he
a
cheery
old
card
grunted
harry
to
jack
as
they
slogged
up
to
arras
with
rifle
and
pack
but
he
did
for
them
both
by
his
plan
of
attack
lamentations
i
found
him
in
the
at
the
base
from
the
blind
darkness
i
had
heard
his
crying
and
blundered
in
with
puzzled
patient
face
a
sergeant
watched
him
it
was
no
good
trying
to
stop
it
for
he
howled
and
beat
his
chest
and
all
because
his
brother
had
gone
west
raved
at
the
bleeding
war
his
rampant
grief
moaned
shouted
sobbed
and
choked
while
he
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
in
my
belief
such
men
have
lost
all
patriotic
feeling
does
it
matter
does
it
matter
losing
your
leg
for
people
will
always
be
kind
and
you
need
not
show
that
you
mind
when
the
others
come
in
after
hunting
to
gobble
their
muffins
and
eggs
does
it
matter
losing
your
sight
there
such
splendid
work
for
the
blind
and
people
will
always
be
kind
as
you
sit
on
the
terrace
remembering
and
turning
your
face
to
the
light
do
they
matter
those
dreams
from
the
pit
you
can
drink
and
forget
and
be
glad
and
people
wo
say
that
you
mad
for
they
know
that
you
fought
for
your
country
and
no
one
will
worry
a
bit
fight
to
a
finish
the
boys
came
back
bands
played
and
flags
were
flying
and
thronged
the
sunlit
street
to
cheer
the
soldiers
who
refrained
from
dying
and
hear
the
music
of
returning
feet
of
all
the
thrills
and
ardours
war
has
brought
this
moment
is
the
finest
so
they
thought
snapping
their
bayonets
on
to
charge
the
mob
grim
fusiliers
broke
ranks
with
glint
of
steel
at
last
the
boys
had
found
a
cushy
job
i
heard
the
grunt
and
squeal
and
with
my
trusty
bombers
turned
and
went
to
clear
those
junkers
out
of
parliament
editorial
impressions
he
seemed
so
certain
all
was
going
well
as
he
discussed
the
glorious
time
he
had
while
visiting
the
trenches
one
can
tell
you
gathered
big
impressions
grinned
the
lad
who
been
severely
wounded
in
the
back
in
some
impossible
attack
impressions
yes
most
vivid
i
am
writing
a
little
book
called
on
the
based
on
notes
made
while
witnessing
the
fighting
i
hope
i
caught
the
feeling
of
and
the
amazing
spirit
of
the
troops
by
jove
those
of
ours
are
fine
i
watched
one
daring
beggar
looping
loops
soaring
and
diving
like
some
bird
of
prey
and
through
it
all
i
felt
that
splendour
shine
which
makes
us
win
the
soldier
sipped
his
wine
ah
yes
but
it
the
press
that
leads
the
way
suicide
in
the
trenches
i
knew
a
simple
soldier
boy
who
grinned
at
life
in
empty
joy
slept
soundly
through
the
lonesome
dark
and
whistled
early
with
the
lark
in
winter
trenches
cowed
and
glum
with
crumps
and
lice
and
lack
of
rum
he
put
a
bullet
through
his
brain
no
one
spoke
of
him
again
you
crowds
with
kindling
eye
who
cheer
when
soldier
lads
march
by
sneak
home
and
pray
you
never
know
the
hell
where
youth
and
laughter
go
glory
of
women
you
love
us
when
we
heroes
home
on
leave
or
wounded
in
a
mentionable
place
you
worship
decorations
you
believe
that
chivalry
redeems
the
war
disgrace
you
make
us
shells
you
listen
with
delight
by
tales
of
dirt
and
danger
fondly
thrilled
you
crown
our
distant
ardours
while
we
fight
and
mourn
our
laurelled
memories
when
we
killed
you
ca
believe
that
british
troops
retire
when
hell
last
horror
breaks
them
and
they
run
trampling
the
terrible
corpses
blind
with
blood
o
german
mother
dreaming
by
the
fire
while
you
are
knitting
socks
to
send
your
son
his
face
is
trodden
deeper
in
the
mud
their
frailty
he
got
a
blighty
wound
he
safe
and
then
war
fine
and
bold
and
bright
she
can
forget
the
doomed
and
prisoned
men
who
agonize
and
fight
he
back
in
france
she
loathes
the
listless
strain
and
peril
of
his
plight
beseeching
heaven
to
send
him
home
again
she
prays
for
peace
each
night
husbands
and
sons
and
lovers
everywhere
they
die
war
bleeds
us
white
mothers
and
wives
and
sweethearts
they
do
care
so
long
as
he
all
right
the
hawthorn
tree
not
much
to
me
is
yonder
lane
where
i
go
every
day
but
when
there
been
a
shower
of
rain
and
whistle
gay
i
know
my
lad
that
out
in
france
with
fearsome
things
to
see
would
give
his
eyes
for
just
one
glance
at
our
white
hawthorn
tree
not
much
to
me
is
yonder
lane
where
so
longs
to
tread
but
when
there
been
a
shower
of
rain
i
think
i
never
weep
again
until
i
heard
he
dead
the
investiture
god
with
a
roll
of
honour
in
his
hand
sits
welcoming
the
heroes
who
have
died
while
sorrowless
angels
ranked
on
either
side
stand
easy
in
elysium
then
come
shyly
through
the
garden
gate
wearing
a
bandage
on
your
head
and
god
says
something
kind
because
you
dead
and
homesick
discontented
with
your
fate
if
i
were
there
we
snowball
death
with
skulls
or
ride
away
to
hunt
in
devil
wood
with
ghosts
of
puppies
that
we
walked
of
old
but
you
alone
and
solitude
annuls
our
earthly
jokes
and
strangely
wise
and
good
you
roam
forlorn
along
the
streets
of
gold
trench
duty
shaken
from
sleep
and
numbed
and
scarce
awake
out
in
the
trench
with
three
hours
watch
to
take
i
blunder
through
the
splashing
mirk
and
then
hear
the
gruff
muttering
voices
of
the
men
crouching
in
cabins
with
light
hark
there
the
big
bombardment
on
our
right
rumbling
and
bumping
and
the
dark
a
glare
of
flickering
horror
in
the
sectors
where
we
raid
the
boche
men
waiting
stiff
and
chilled
or
crawling
on
their
bellies
through
the
wire
what
wanted
some
one
killed
five
minutes
ago
i
heard
a
sniper
fire
why
did
he
do
it
starlight
overhead
blank
stars
i
and
some
chap
dead
break
of
day
there
seemed
a
smell
of
autumn
in
the
air
at
the
bleak
end
of
night
he
shivered
there
in
a
dank
musty
where
he
lay
legs
wrapped
in
lumps
of
chalk
and
clay
spattering
his
face
he
thought
we
start
the
damned
attack
and
lord
knows
why
zero
at
nine
how
bloody
if
i
done
in
under
the
freedom
of
that
morning
sky
and
then
he
coughed
and
dozed
cursing
the
din
was
it
the
ghost
of
autumn
in
that
smell
of
underground
or
god
blank
heart
grown
kind
that
sent
a
happy
dream
to
him
in
hell
where
men
are
crushed
like
clods
and
crawl
to
find
some
crater
for
their
wretchedness
who
lie
in
outcast
immolation
doomed
to
die
far
from
clean
things
or
any
hope
of
cheer
cowed
anger
in
their
eyes
till
darkness
brims
and
roars
into
their
heads
and
they
can
hear
old
childish
talk
and
tags
of
foolish
hymns
he
sniffs
the
chilly
air
his
dreaming
starts
he
riding
in
a
dusty
sussex
lane
in
quiet
september
slowly
night
departs
and
he
a
living
soul
absolved
from
pain
beyond
the
brambled
fences
where
he
goes
are
glimmering
fields
with
harvest
piled
in
sheaves
and
dark
against
the
stars
grown
pale
then
clear
and
shrill
a
distant
crows
and
there
a
wall
of
mist
along
the
vale
where
willows
shake
their
leaves
he
gazes
on
it
all
and
scarce
believes
that
earth
is
telling
its
old
peaceful
tale
he
thanks
the
blessed
world
that
he
was
born
then
far
away
a
lonely
note
of
the
horn
they
drawing
the
big
wood
unlatch
the
gate
and
set
golumpus
going
on
the
grass
knows
the
corner
where
it
best
to
wait
and
hear
the
crashing
woodland
chorus
pass
the
corner
where
old
foxes
make
their
track
to
the
long
spinney
that
the
place
to
be
the
bracken
shakes
below
an
ivied
tree
and
then
a
cub
looks
out
and
he
bawls
and
swings
his
thong
with
volleying
crack
all
the
clean
thrill
of
autumn
in
his
blood
and
hunting
surging
through
him
like
a
flood
in
joyous
welcome
from
the
untroubled
past
while
the
war
drifts
away
forgotten
at
last
now
a
red
sleepy
sun
above
the
rim
of
twilight
stares
along
the
quiet
weald
and
the
kind
simple
country
shines
revealed
in
solitudes
of
peace
no
longer
dim
the
old
horse
lifts
his
face
and
thanks
the
light
then
stretches
down
his
head
to
crop
the
green
all
things
that
he
has
loved
are
in
his
sight
the
places
where
his
happiness
has
been
are
in
his
eyes
his
heart
and
they
are
good
hark
there
the
horn
they
drawing
the
big
wood
to
any
dead
officer
well
how
are
things
in
heaven
i
wish
you
say
because
i
like
to
know
that
you
all
right
tell
me
have
you
found
everlasting
day
or
been
sucked
in
by
everlasting
night
for
when
i
shut
my
eyes
your
face
shows
pain
i
hear
you
make
some
cheery
old
remark
i
can
rebuild
you
in
my
brain
though
you
gone
out
patrolling
in
the
dark
you
hated
tours
of
trenches
you
were
proud
of
nothing
more
than
having
good
years
to
spend
longed
to
get
home
and
join
the
careless
crowd
of
chaps
who
work
in
peace
with
time
for
friend
that
all
washed
out
now
you
beyond
the
wire
no
earthly
chance
can
send
you
crawling
back
you
finished
with
fire
knocked
over
in
a
hopeless
somehow
i
always
thought
you
get
done
in
because
you
were
so
desperate
keen
to
live
you
were
all
out
to
try
and
save
your
skin
well
knowing
how
much
the
world
had
got
to
give
you
joked
at
shells
and
talked
the
usual
shop
stuck
to
your
dirty
job
and
did
it
fine
with
jesus
christ
when
it
stop
three
years
it
hell
unless
we
break
their
line
so
when
they
told
me
you
been
left
for
dead
i
would
believe
them
feeling
it
be
true
next
week
the
bloody
roll
of
honour
said
wounded
and
missing
that
the
thing
to
do
when
lads
are
left
in
dying
slow
with
nothing
but
blank
sky
and
wounds
that
ache
moaning
for
water
till
they
know
it
night
and
then
it
not
worth
while
to
wake
old
lad
remember
me
to
god
and
tell
him
that
our
politicians
swear
they
wo
give
in
till
prussian
rule
been
trod
under
the
heel
of
england
are
you
there
yes
and
the
war
wo
end
for
at
least
two
years
but
we
got
stacks
of
men
i
blind
with
tears
staring
into
the
dark
cheero
i
wish
they
killed
you
in
a
decent
show
sick
leave
when
i
asleep
dreaming
and
lulled
and
warm
they
come
the
homeless
ones
the
noiseless
dead
while
the
dim
charging
breakers
of
the
storm
bellow
and
drone
and
rumble
overhead
out
of
the
gloom
they
gather
about
my
bed
they
whisper
to
my
heart
their
thoughts
are
mine
why
are
you
here
with
all
your
watches
ended
from
ypres
to
frise
we
sought
you
in
the
line
in
bitter
safety
i
awake
unfriended
and
while
the
dawn
begins
with
slashing
rain
i
think
of
the
battalion
in
the
mud
when
are
you
going
out
to
them
again
are
they
not
still
your
brothers
through
our
blood
banishment
i
am
banished
from
the
patient
men
who
fight
they
smote
my
heart
to
pity
built
my
pride
shoulder
to
aching
shoulder
side
by
side
they
trudged
away
from
life
broad
wealds
of
light
their
wrongs
were
mine
and
ever
in
my
sight
they
went
arrayed
in
honour
but
they
died
not
one
by
one
and
mutinous
i
cried
to
those
who
sent
them
out
into
the
night
the
darkness
tells
how
vainly
i
have
striven
to
free
them
from
the
pit
where
they
must
dwell
in
outcast
gloom
convulsed
and
jagged
and
riven
by
grappling
guns
love
drove
me
to
rebel
love
drives
me
back
to
grope
with
them
through
hell
and
in
their
tortured
eyes
i
stand
forgiven
of
the
war
in
fifty
years
when
peace
outshines
remembrance
of
the
battle
lines
adventurous
lads
will
sigh
and
cast
proud
looks
upon
the
plundered
past
on
summer
morn
or
winter
night
their
hearts
will
kindle
for
the
fight
reading
a
snatch
of
savage
and
jaunty
fierce
and
strong
and
through
the
angry
marching
rhymes
of
blind
regret
and
haggard
mirth
they
envy
us
the
dazzling
times
when
sacrifice
absolved
our
earth
some
ancient
man
with
silver
locks
will
lift
his
weary
face
to
say
war
was
a
fiend
who
stopped
our
clocks
although
we
met
him
grim
and
gay
and
then
he
speak
of
haig
last
drive
marvelling
that
any
came
alive
out
of
the
shambles
that
men
built
and
smashed
to
cleanse
the
world
of
guilt
but
the
boys
with
grin
and
sidelong
glance
will
think
poor
grandad
day
is
done
and
dream
of
those
who
fought
in
france
and
lived
in
time
to
share
the
fun
thrushes
tossed
on
the
glittering
air
they
soar
and
skim
whose
voices
make
the
emptiness
of
light
a
windy
palace
quavering
from
the
brim
of
dawn
and
bold
with
song
at
edge
of
night
they
clutch
their
leafy
pinnacles
and
sing
scornful
of
man
and
from
his
toils
aloof
whose
heart
a
haunted
woodland
whispering
whose
thoughts
return
on
wing
who
hears
the
cry
of
god
in
everything
and
storms
the
gate
of
nothingness
for
proof
autumn
october
bellowing
anger
breaks
and
cleaves
the
bronzed
battalions
of
the
stricken
wood
in
whose
lament
i
hear
a
voice
that
grieves
for
battle
fruitless
harvest
and
the
feud
of
outraged
men
their
lives
are
like
the
leaves
scattered
in
flocks
of
ruin
tossed
and
blown
along
the
westering
furnace
flaring
red
o
martyred
youth
and
manhood
overthrown
the
burden
of
your
wrongs
is
on
my
head
invocation
come
down
from
heaven
to
meet
me
when
my
breath
chokes
and
through
drumming
shafts
of
stifling
death
i
stumble
toward
escape
to
find
the
door
opening
on
morn
where
i
may
breathe
once
more
clear
airs
across
some
valley
dim
with
whispering
trees
while
dawn
along
the
rim
of
night
horizon
flows
in
lakes
of
fire
come
down
from
heaven
bright
hill
my
song
desire
belov
and
faithful
teach
my
soul
to
wake
in
glades
with
flowers
that
gleam
and
shake
and
flock
your
paths
with
wonder
in
your
gaze
show
me
the
vanquished
vigil
of
my
days
mute
in
that
golden
silence
hung
with
green
come
down
from
heaven
and
bring
me
in
your
eyes
remembrance
of
all
beauty
that
has
been
and
stillness
from
the
pools
of
paradise
repression
of
war
experience
now
light
the
candles
one
two
there
a
moth
what
silly
beggars
they
are
to
blunder
in
and
scorch
their
wings
with
glory
liquid
flame
no
no
not
that
it
bad
to
think
of
war
when
thoughts
you
gagged
all
day
come
back
to
scare
you
and
it
been
proved
that
soldiers
do
go
mad
unless
they
lose
control
of
ugly
thoughts
that
drive
them
out
to
jabber
among
the
trees
now
light
your
pipe
look
what
a
steady
hand
draw
a
deep
breath
stop
thinking
count
fifteen
and
you
as
right
as
rain
why
wo
it
rain
i
wish
there
be
a
with
bucketsful
of
water
to
sluice
the
dark
and
make
the
roses
hang
their
dripping
heads
books
what
a
jolly
company
they
are
standing
so
quiet
and
patient
on
their
shelves
dressed
in
dim
brown
and
black
and
white
and
green
and
every
kind
of
colour
which
will
you
read
come
on
o
read
something
they
so
wise
i
tell
you
all
the
wisdom
of
the
world
is
waiting
for
you
on
those
shelves
and
yet
you
sit
and
gnaw
your
nails
and
let
your
pipe
out
and
listen
to
the
silence
on
the
ceiling
there
one
big
dizzy
moth
that
bumps
and
flutters
and
in
the
breathless
air
outside
the
house
the
garden
waits
for
something
that
delays
there
must
be
crowds
of
ghosts
among
the
trees
not
people
killed
in
battle
they
in
france
but
horrible
shapes
in
shrouds
old
men
who
died
slow
natural
deaths
old
men
with
ugly
souls
who
wore
their
bodies
out
with
nasty
sins
you
quiet
and
peaceful
summering
safe
at
home
you
never
think
there
was
a
bloody
war
on
o
yes
you
would
why
you
can
hear
the
guns
hark
thud
thud
thud
quite
soft
they
never
cease
those
whispering
guns
o
christ
i
want
to
go
out
and
screech
at
them
to
stop
i
going
crazy
i
going
stark
staring
mad
because
of
the
guns
the
triumph
when
life
was
a
cobweb
of
stars
for
beauty
who
came
in
the
whisper
of
leaves
or
a
bird
lone
cry
in
the
glen
on
hills
and
horizons
girdled
with
flame
i
sought
for
the
triumph
that
troubles
the
faces
of
men
with
death
in
the
terrible
flickering
gloom
of
the
fight
i
was
cruel
and
fierce
with
despair
i
was
naked
and
bound
was
stricken
and
beauty
returned
through
the
shambles
of
night
in
the
faces
of
men
she
returned
and
their
triumph
i
found
survivors
no
doubt
they
soon
get
well
the
shock
and
strain
have
caused
their
stammering
disconnected
talk
of
course
they
longing
to
go
out
again
these
boys
with
old
scared
faces
learning
to
walk
they
soon
forget
their
haunted
nights
their
cowed
subjection
to
the
ghosts
of
friends
who
died
their
dreams
that
drip
with
murder
and
they
be
proud
of
glorious
war
that
shatter
all
their
pride
men
who
went
out
to
battle
grim
and
glad
children
with
eyes
that
hate
you
broken
and
mad
craiglockart
ring
your
sweet
bells
but
let
them
be
farewells
to
the
gladness
of
the
past
that
changed
us
into
soldiers
swing
your
bells
to
a
joyful
chime
but
let
it
be
the
last
what
means
this
metal
in
windy
belfries
hung
when
guns
are
all
our
need
dissolve
these
bells
whose
tones
are
tuned
for
peace
with
martial
tongue
let
them
cry
doom
and
storm
the
sun
with
shells
bells
are
like
prelates
who
proclaim
that
if
our
lord
returned
he
fight
for
so
let
our
bells
and
bishops
do
the
same
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
motor
bus
remorse
lost
in
the
swamp
and
welter
of
the
pit
he
flounders
off
the
only
he
knows
each
flash
and
spouting
crash
each
instant
lit
when
gloom
reveals
the
streaming
rain
he
goes
heavily
blindly
on
and
while
he
blunders
could
anything
be
worse
than
this
he
wonders
remembering
how
he
saw
those
germans
run
screaming
for
mercy
among
the
stumps
of
trees
they
dodged
and
darted
there
was
one
livid
with
terror
clutching
at
his
knees
our
chaps
were
sticking
like
pigs
o
hell
he
thought
there
things
in
war
one
dare
not
tell
poor
father
sitting
safe
at
home
who
reads
of
dying
heroes
and
their
deathless
deeds
dead
musicians
i
from
you
beethoven
bach
mozart
the
substance
of
my
dreams
took
fire
you
built
cathedrals
in
my
heart
and
lit
my
pinnacled
desire
you
were
the
ardour
and
the
bright
procession
of
my
thoughts
toward
prayer
you
were
the
wrath
of
storm
the
light
on
distant
citadels
aflare
ii
great
names
i
can
not
find
you
now
in
these
loud
years
of
youth
that
strives
through
doom
toward
peace
upon
my
brow
i
wear
a
wreath
of
banished
lives
you
have
no
part
with
lads
who
fought
and
laughed
and
suffered
at
my
side
your
fugues
and
symphonies
have
brought
no
memory
of
my
friends
who
died
iii
for
when
my
brain
is
on
their
track
in
slangy
speech
i
call
them
back
with
tunes
their
ghosts
i
charm
another
little
drink
wo
do
us
any
harm
i
think
of
a
bit
of
and
see
their
faces
crowding
round
to
the
sound
of
the
syncopated
beat
they
got
such
jolly
things
to
tell
home
from
hell
with
a
blighty
wound
so
neat
and
so
the
song
breaks
off
and
i
alone
they
dead
for
god
sake
stop
that
gramophone
the
dream
i
moonlight
and
blossom
and
the
scent
of
summer
gardens
these
can
bring
you
all
those
dreams
that
in
the
starlit
silence
fall
sweet
songs
are
full
of
odours
while
i
went
last
night
in
drizzling
dusk
along
a
lane
i
passed
a
squalid
farm
from
byre
and
midden
came
the
rank
smell
that
brought
me
once
again
a
dream
of
war
that
in
the
past
was
hidden
ii
up
a
disconsolate
straggling
village
street
i
saw
the
tired
troops
trudge
i
heard
their
feet
the
cheery
was
there
to
meet
and
guide
our
company
in
i
watched
them
stumble
into
some
crazy
hovel
too
beat
to
grumble
saw
them
file
inward
slipping
from
their
backs
rifles
equipment
packs
on
filthy
straw
they
sit
in
the
gloom
each
face
bowed
to
patched
sodden
boots
they
must
unlace
while
the
wind
chills
their
sweat
through
chinks
and
cracks
iii
i
looking
at
their
blistered
feet
young
jones
stares
up
at
me
and
white
and
jaded
out
of
his
eyes
the
morning
light
has
faded
old
soldiers
with
three
winters
in
their
bones
puff
their
damp
woodbines
whistle
stretch
their
toes
can
still
grin
at
me
for
each
of
knows
that
i
as
tired
as
they
are
can
they
guess
the
secret
burden
that
is
always
mine
pride
in
their
courage
pity
for
their
distress
and
burning
bitterness
that
i
must
take
them
to
the
accursèd
line
iv
i
can
not
hear
their
voices
but
i
see
dim
candles
in
the
barn
they
gulp
their
tea
and
soon
they
sleep
like
logs
ten
miles
away
the
battle
winks
and
thuds
in
blundering
strife
and
i
must
lead
them
nearer
day
by
day
to
the
foul
beast
of
war
that
bludgeons
life
in
barracks
the
washed
clean
with
rain
shines
wet
and
and
cold
young
fusiliers
and
bold
march
and
wheel
and
march
again
the
sun
looks
over
the
barrack
gate
warm
and
white
with
glaring
shine
to
watch
the
soldiers
of
the
line
that
life
has
hired
to
fight
with
fate
fall
out
the
long
parades
are
done
up
comes
the
dark
down
goes
the
sun
the
square
is
walled
with
windowed
light
sleep
well
you
lusty
fusiliers
shut
your
brave
eyes
on
sense
and
sight
and
banish
from
your
dreamless
ears
the
bugle
lying
notes
that
say
another
night
another
day
together
splashing
along
the
boggy
woods
all
day
and
over
brambled
hedge
and
holding
clay
i
shall
not
think
of
him
but
when
the
watery
fields
grow
brown
and
dim
and
hounds
have
lost
their
fox
and
horses
tire
i
know
that
he
be
with
me
on
my
way
home
through
the
darkness
to
the
evening
fire
he
jumped
each
stile
along
the
glistening
lanes
his
hand
will
be
upon
the
reins
hearing
the
saddle
creak
he
wonder
if
the
frost
will
come
next
week
i
shall
forget
him
in
the
morning
light
and
while
we
gallop
on
he
will
not
speak
but
at
the
he
say
