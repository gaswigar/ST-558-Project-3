a
drum
begins
hides
in
the
house
of
aram
baksh
the
speaker
voice
quivered
with
earnestness
and
his
lean
fingers
clawed
at
conan
mightily
muscled
arm
as
he
croaked
his
warning
he
was
a
wiry
man
with
a
straggling
black
beard
and
his
ragged
garments
proclaimed
him
a
nomad
he
looked
smaller
and
meaner
than
ever
in
contrast
to
the
giant
cimmerian
with
his
black
brows
broad
chest
and
powerful
limbs
they
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
bazar
and
on
either
side
of
them
flowed
past
the
stream
of
the
zamboula
streets
which
is
exotic
hybrid
flamboyant
and
clamorous
conan
pulled
his
eyes
back
from
following
a
ghanara
whose
short
skirt
bared
her
brown
thigh
at
each
insolent
step
and
frowned
down
at
his
importunate
companion
do
you
mean
by
peril
he
demanded
the
desert
man
glanced
furtively
over
his
shoulder
before
replying
and
lowered
his
voice
can
say
but
desert
men
and
travelers
slept
in
the
house
of
aram
baksh
and
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
again
what
became
of
them
swore
they
rose
and
went
their
way
and
it
is
true
that
no
citizen
of
the
city
has
ever
disappeared
from
his
house
but
no
one
saw
the
travelers
again
and
men
say
that
goods
and
equipment
recognized
as
theirs
have
been
seen
in
the
bazars
if
aram
did
not
sell
them
after
doing
away
with
their
owners
how
came
they
here
have
no
goods
growled
the
cimmerian
touching
the
hilt
of
the
broadsword
that
hung
at
his
hip
have
even
sold
my
horse
it
is
not
always
rich
strangers
who
vanish
by
night
from
the
house
of
aram
baksh
chattered
the
zuagir
poor
desert
men
have
slept
there
because
his
score
is
less
than
that
of
the
other
taverns
and
have
been
seen
no
more
once
a
chief
of
the
zuagirs
whose
son
had
thus
vanished
complained
to
the
satrap
jungir
khan
who
ordered
the
house
searched
by
soldiers
they
found
a
cellar
full
of
corpses
asked
conan
in
derision
they
found
naught
and
drove
the
chief
from
the
city
with
threats
and
curses
but
he
drew
closer
to
conan
and
shivered
else
was
found
at
the
edge
of
the
desert
beyond
the
houses
there
is
a
clump
of
palm
trees
and
within
that
grove
there
is
a
pit
and
within
that
pit
have
been
found
human
bones
charred
and
blackened
not
once
but
many
times
proves
what
grunted
the
cimmerian
baksh
is
a
demon
nay
in
this
accursed
city
which
stygians
built
and
which
hyrkanians
rule
where
white
brown
and
black
folk
mingle
together
to
produce
hybrids
of
all
unholy
hues
and
breeds
who
can
tell
who
is
a
man
and
who
a
demon
in
disguise
aram
baksh
is
a
demon
in
the
form
of
a
man
at
night
he
assumes
his
true
guise
and
carries
his
guests
off
into
the
desert
where
his
fellow
demons
from
the
waste
meet
in
conclave
does
he
always
carry
off
strangers
asked
conan
skeptically
people
of
the
city
would
not
suffer
him
to
slay
their
people
but
they
care
naught
for
the
strangers
who
fall
into
his
hands
conan
you
are
of
the
west
and
know
not
the
secrets
of
this
ancient
land
but
since
the
beginning
of
happenings
the
demons
of
the
desert
have
worshipped
yog
the
lord
of
the
empty
abodes
with
fire
fire
that
devours
human
victims
warned
you
have
dwelt
for
many
moons
in
the
tents
of
the
zuagirs
and
you
are
our
brother
go
not
to
the
house
of
aram
baksh
out
of
sight
conan
said
suddenly
comes
a
squad
of
the
if
they
see
you
they
may
remember
a
horse
that
was
stolen
from
the
satrap
stable
the
zuagir
gasped
and
moved
convulsively
he
ducked
between
a
booth
and
a
stone
pausing
only
long
enough
to
chatter
warned
my
brother
there
are
demons
in
the
house
of
aram
baksh
then
he
darted
down
a
narrow
alley
and
was
gone
conan
shifted
his
broad
to
his
liking
and
calmly
returned
the
searching
stares
directed
at
him
by
the
squad
of
watchmen
as
they
swung
past
they
eyed
him
curiously
and
suspiciously
for
he
was
a
man
who
stood
out
even
in
such
a
motley
throng
as
crowded
the
winding
streets
of
zamboula
his
blue
eyes
and
alien
features
distinguished
him
from
the
eastern
swarms
and
the
straight
sword
at
his
hip
added
point
to
the
racial
difference
the
watchmen
did
not
accost
him
but
swung
on
down
the
street
while
the
crowd
opened
a
lane
for
them
they
were
pelishtim
squat
with
beards
sweeping
their
mailed
breasts
mercenaries
hired
for
work
the
ruling
turanians
considered
beneath
themselves
and
no
less
hated
by
the
mongrel
population
for
that
reason
conan
glanced
at
the
sun
just
beginning
to
dip
behind
the
houses
on
the
western
side
of
the
bazar
and
hitching
once
more
at
his
belt
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
aram
baksh
tavern
with
a
hillman
stride
he
moved
through
the
colors
of
the
streets
where
the
ragged
tunics
of
whining
beggars
brushed
against
the
khalats
of
lordly
merchants
and
the
satin
of
rich
courtezans
giant
black
slaves
slouched
along
jostling
wanderers
from
the
shemitish
cities
ragged
nomads
from
the
surrounding
deserts
traders
and
adventurers
from
all
the
lands
of
the
east
the
native
population
was
no
less
heterogenous
here
centuries
ago
the
armies
of
stygia
had
come
carving
an
empire
out
of
the
eastern
desert
zamboula
was
but
a
small
then
lying
amidst
a
ring
of
oases
and
inhabited
by
descendants
of
nomads
the
stygians
built
it
into
a
city
and
settled
it
with
their
own
people
and
with
shemite
and
kushite
slaves
the
ceaseless
caravans
threading
the
desert
from
east
to
west
and
back
again
brought
riches
and
more
mingling
of
races
then
came
the
conquering
turanians
riding
out
of
the
east
to
thrust
back
the
boundaries
of
stygia
and
now
for
a
generation
zamboula
had
been
westernmost
outpost
ruled
by
a
turanian
satrap
the
babel
of
a
myriad
tongues
smote
on
the
cimmerian
ears
as
the
restless
pattern
of
the
zamboula
streets
weaved
about
him
cleft
now
and
then
by
a
squad
of
clattering
horsemen
the
tall
supple
warriors
of
turan
with
dark
clinking
metal
and
curved
swords
the
throng
scampered
from
under
their
horses
hoofs
for
they
were
the
lords
of
zamboula
but
tall
somber
stygians
standing
back
in
the
shadows
glowered
darkly
remembering
their
ancient
glories
the
hybrid
population
cared
little
whether
the
king
who
controlled
their
destinies
dwelt
in
dark
khemi
or
gleaming
aghrapur
jungir
khan
ruled
zamboula
and
men
whispered
that
nafertari
the
satrap
mistress
ruled
jungir
khan
but
the
people
went
their
way
flaunting
their
myriad
colors
in
the
streets
bargaining
disputing
gambling
swilling
loving
as
the
people
of
zamboula
have
done
for
all
the
centuries
its
towers
and
minarets
have
lifted
over
the
sands
of
the
kharamun
bronze
lanterns
carved
with
leering
dragons
had
been
lighted
in
the
streets
before
conan
reached
the
house
of
aram
baksh
the
tavern
was
the
last
occupied
house
on
the
street
which
ran
west
a
wide
garden
enclosed
by
a
wall
where
grew
thick
separated
it
from
the
houses
farther
east
to
the
west
of
the
inn
stood
another
grove
of
palms
through
which
the
street
now
become
a
road
wound
out
into
the
desert
across
the
road
from
the
tavern
stood
a
row
of
deserted
huts
shaded
by
straggling
palm
trees
and
occupied
only
by
bats
and
jackals
as
conan
came
down
the
road
he
wondered
why
the
beggars
so
plentiful
in
zamboula
had
not
appropriated
these
empty
houses
for
sleeping
quarters
the
lights
ceased
some
distance
behind
him
here
were
no
lanterns
except
the
one
hanging
before
the
tavern
gate
only
the
stars
the
soft
dust
of
the
road
underfoot
and
the
rustle
of
the
palm
leaves
in
the
desert
breeze
aram
gate
did
not
open
upon
the
road
but
upon
the
alley
which
ran
between
the
tavern
and
the
garden
of
the
conan
jerked
lustily
at
the
rope
which
depended
from
the
bell
beside
the
lantern
augmenting
its
clamor
by
hammering
on
the
teakwork
gate
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
a
wicket
opened
in
the
gate
and
a
black
face
peered
through
blast
you
requested
conan
a
guest
i
paid
aram
for
a
room
and
a
room
i
have
by
crom
the
black
craned
his
neck
to
stare
into
the
starlit
road
behind
conan
but
he
opened
the
gate
without
comment
and
closed
it
again
behind
the
cimmerian
locking
and
bolting
it
the
wall
was
unusually
high
but
there
were
many
thieves
in
zamboula
and
a
house
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
might
have
to
be
defended
against
a
nocturnal
nomad
raid
conan
strode
through
a
garden
where
great
pale
blossoms
nodded
in
the
starlight
and
entered
the
where
a
stygian
with
the
shaven
head
of
a
student
sat
at
a
table
brooding
over
nameless
mysteries
and
some
nondescripts
wrangled
over
a
game
of
dice
in
a
corner
aram
baksh
came
forward
walking
softly
a
portly
man
with
a
black
beard
that
swept
his
breast
a
jutting
and
small
black
eyes
which
were
never
still
wish
food
he
asked
ate
a
joint
of
beef
and
a
loaf
of
bread
in
the
grunted
conan
me
a
tankard
of
ghazan
wine
i
got
just
enough
left
to
pay
for
it
he
tossed
a
copper
coin
on
the
board
did
not
win
at
the
could
i
with
only
a
handful
of
silver
to
begin
with
i
paid
you
for
the
room
this
morning
because
i
knew
i
probably
lose
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
had
a
roof
over
my
head
tonight
i
notice
nobody
sleeps
in
the
streets
in
zamboula
the
very
beggars
hunt
a
niche
they
can
barricade
before
dark
the
city
must
be
full
of
a
particularly
brand
of
thieves
he
gulped
the
cheap
wine
with
relish
and
then
followed
aram
out
of
the
behind
him
the
players
halted
their
game
to
stare
after
him
with
a
cryptic
speculation
in
their
eyes
they
said
nothing
but
the
stygian
laughed
a
ghastly
laugh
of
inhuman
cynicism
and
mockery
the
others
lowered
their
eyes
uneasily
avoiding
one
another
glance
the
arts
studied
by
a
stygian
scholar
are
not
calculated
to
make
him
share
the
feelings
of
a
normal
human
being
conan
followed
aram
down
a
corridor
lighted
by
copper
lamps
and
it
did
not
please
him
to
note
his
host
noiseless
tread
aram
feet
were
clad
in
soft
slippers
and
the
hallway
was
carpeted
with
thick
turanian
rugs
but
there
was
an
unpleasant
suggestion
of
stealthiness
about
the
zamboulan
at
the
end
of
the
winding
corridor
aram
halted
at
a
door
across
which
a
heavy
iron
bar
rested
in
powerful
metal
brackets
this
aram
lifted
and
showed
the
cimmerian
into
a
chamber
the
windows
of
which
conan
instantly
noted
were
small
and
strongly
set
with
twisted
bars
of
iron
tastefully
gilded
there
were
rugs
on
the
floor
a
couch
after
the
eastern
fashion
and
ornately
carved
stools
it
was
a
much
more
elaborate
chamber
than
conan
could
have
procured
for
the
price
nearer
the
center
of
the
city
a
fact
that
had
first
attracted
him
when
that
morning
he
discovered
how
slim
a
purse
his
roisterings
for
the
past
few
days
had
left
him
he
had
ridden
into
zamboula
from
the
desert
a
week
before
aram
had
lighted
a
bronze
lamp
and
he
now
called
conan
attention
to
the
two
doors
both
were
provided
with
heavy
bolts
may
sleep
safely
tonight
cimmerian
said
aram
blinking
over
his
bushy
beard
from
the
inner
doorway
conan
grunted
and
tossed
his
naked
broadsword
on
the
couch
bolts
and
bars
are
strong
but
i
always
sleep
with
steel
by
my
side
aram
made
no
reply
he
stood
fingering
his
thick
beard
for
a
moment
as
he
stared
at
the
grim
weapon
then
silently
he
withdrew
closing
the
door
behind
him
conan
shot
the
bolt
into
place
crossed
the
room
opened
the
opposite
door
and
looked
out
the
room
was
on
the
side
of
the
house
that
faced
the
road
running
west
from
the
city
the
door
opened
into
a
small
court
that
was
enclosed
by
a
wall
of
its
own
the
which
shut
it
off
from
the
rest
of
the
tavern
compound
were
high
and
without
entrances
but
the
wall
that
flanked
the
road
was
low
and
there
was
no
lock
on
the
gate
conan
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
door
the
glow
of
the
bronze
lamp
behind
him
looking
down
the
road
to
where
it
vanished
among
the
dense
palms
their
leaves
rustled
together
in
the
faint
breeze
beyond
them
lay
the
naked
desert
far
up
the
street
in
the
other
direction
lights
gleamed
and
the
noises
of
the
city
came
faintly
to
him
here
was
only
starlight
the
whispering
of
the
palm
leaves
and
beyond
that
low
wall
the
dust
of
the
road
and
the
deserted
huts
thrusting
their
flat
roofs
against
the
low
stars
somewhere
beyond
the
palm
groves
a
drum
began
the
garbled
warnings
of
the
zuagir
returned
to
him
seeming
somehow
less
fantastic
than
they
had
seemed
in
the
crowded
sunlit
streets
he
wondered
again
at
the
riddle
of
those
empty
huts
why
did
the
beggars
shun
them
he
turned
back
into
the
chamber
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
the
light
began
to
flicker
and
he
investigated
swearing
when
he
found
the
palm
oil
in
the
lamp
was
almost
exhausted
he
started
to
shout
for
aram
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
blew
out
the
light
in
the
soft
darkness
he
stretched
himself
fully
clad
on
the
couch
his
sinewy
hand
by
instinct
searching
for
and
closing
on
the
hilt
of
his
broadsword
glancing
idly
at
the
stars
framed
in
the
barred
windows
with
the
murmur
of
the
breeze
through
the
palms
in
his
ears
he
sank
into
slumber
with
a
vague
consciousness
of
the
muttering
drum
out
on
the
desert
the
low
rumble
and
mutter
of
a
drum
beaten
with
soft
rhythmic
strokes
of
an
open
black
hand
the
night
skulkers
it
was
the
stealthy
opening
of
a
door
which
awakened
the
cimmerian
he
did
not
awake
as
civilized
men
do
drowsy
and
drugged
and
stupid
he
awoke
instantly
with
a
clear
mind
recognizing
the
sound
that
had
interrupted
his
sleep
lying
there
tensely
in
the
dark
he
saw
the
outer
door
slowly
open
in
a
widening
crack
of
starlit
sky
he
saw
framed
a
great
black
bulk
broad
stooping
shoulders
and
a
misshapen
head
blocked
out
against
the
stars
conan
felt
the
skin
crawl
between
his
shoulders
he
had
bolted
that
door
securely
how
could
it
be
opening
now
save
by
supernatural
agency
and
how
could
a
human
being
possess
a
head
like
that
outlined
against
the
stars
all
the
tales
he
had
heard
in
the
zuagir
tents
of
devils
and
goblins
came
back
to
bead
his
flesh
with
clammy
sweat
now
the
monster
slid
noiselessly
into
the
room
with
a
crouching
posture
and
a
shambling
gait
and
a
familiar
scent
assailed
the
cimmerian
nostrils
but
did
not
reassure
him
since
zuagir
legendry
represented
demons
as
smelling
like
that
noiselessly
conan
coiled
his
long
legs
under
him
his
naked
sword
was
in
his
right
hand
and
when
he
struck
it
was
as
suddenly
and
murderously
as
a
tiger
lunging
out
of
the
dark
not
even
a
demon
could
have
avoided
that
catapulting
charge
his
sword
met
and
clove
through
flesh
and
bone
and
something
went
heavily
to
the
floor
with
a
strangling
cry
conan
crouched
in
the
dark
above
it
sword
dripping
in
his
hand
devil
or
beast
or
man
the
thing
was
dead
there
on
the
floor
he
sensed
death
as
any
wild
thing
senses
it
he
glared
through
the
door
into
the
starlit
court
beyond
the
gate
stood
open
but
the
court
was
empty
conan
shut
the
door
but
did
not
bolt
it
groping
in
the
darkness
he
found
the
lamp
and
lighted
it
there
was
enough
oil
in
it
to
burn
for
a
minute
or
so
an
instant
later
he
was
bending
over
the
figure
that
sprawled
on
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
blood
it
was
a
gigantic
black
man
naked
but
for
a
one
hand
still
grasped
a
bludgeon
the
fellow
kinky
wool
was
built
up
into
spindles
with
twigs
and
dried
mud
this
barbaric
coiffure
had
given
the
head
its
misshapen
appearance
in
the
starlight
provided
with
a
clue
to
the
riddle
conan
pushed
back
the
thick
red
lips
and
grunted
as
he
stared
down
at
teeth
filed
to
points
he
understood
now
the
mystery
of
the
strangers
who
had
disappeared
from
the
house
of
aram
baksh
the
riddle
of
the
black
drum
thrumming
out
there
beyond
the
palm
groves
and
of
that
pit
of
charred
bones
that
pit
where
strange
meat
might
be
roasted
under
the
stars
while
black
beasts
squatted
about
to
glut
a
hideous
hunger
the
man
on
the
floor
was
a
cannibal
slave
from
darfar
there
were
many
of
his
kind
in
the
city
cannibalism
was
not
tolerated
openly
in
zamboula
but
conan
knew
now
why
people
locked
themselves
in
so
securely
at
night
and
why
even
beggars
shunned
the
open
alleys
and
doorless
ruins
he
grunted
in
disgust
as
he
visualized
brutish
black
shadows
skulking
up
and
down
the
nighted
streets
seeking
human
prey
and
such
men
as
aram
baksh
to
open
the
doors
to
them
the
innkeeper
was
not
a
demon
he
was
worse
the
slaves
from
darfar
were
notorious
thieves
there
was
no
doubt
that
some
of
their
pilfered
loot
found
its
way
into
the
hands
of
aram
baksh
and
in
return
he
sold
them
human
flesh
conan
blew
out
the
light
stepped
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
ran
his
hand
over
the
ornaments
on
the
outer
side
one
of
them
was
movable
and
worked
the
bolt
inside
the
room
was
a
trap
to
catch
human
prey
like
rabbits
but
this
time
instead
of
a
rabbit
it
had
caught
a
tiger
conan
returned
to
the
other
door
lifted
the
bolt
and
pressed
against
it
it
was
immovable
and
he
remembered
the
bolt
on
the
other
side
aram
was
taking
no
chances
either
with
his
victims
or
the
men
with
whom
he
dealt
buckling
on
his
the
cimmerian
strode
out
into
the
court
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
had
no
intention
of
delaying
the
settlement
of
his
reckoning
with
aram
baksh
he
wondered
how
many
poor
devils
had
been
bludgeoned
in
their
sleep
and
dragged
out
of
that
room
and
down
the
road
that
ran
through
the
shadowed
palm
groves
to
the
he
halted
in
the
court
the
drum
was
still
muttering
and
he
caught
the
reflection
of
a
leaping
red
glare
through
the
groves
cannibalism
was
more
than
a
perverted
appetite
with
the
black
men
of
darfar
it
was
an
integral
element
of
their
ghastly
cult
the
black
vultures
were
already
in
conclave
but
whatever
flesh
filled
their
bellies
that
night
it
would
not
be
his
to
reach
aram
baksh
he
must
climb
one
of
the
walls
which
separated
the
small
enclosure
from
the
main
compound
they
were
high
meant
to
keep
out
the
but
conan
was
no
black
man
his
thews
had
been
steeled
in
boyhood
on
the
sheer
cliffs
of
his
native
hills
he
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
nearer
wall
when
a
cry
echoed
under
the
trees
in
an
instant
conan
was
crouching
at
the
gate
glaring
down
the
road
the
sound
had
come
from
the
shadows
of
the
huts
across
the
road
he
heard
a
frantic
choking
and
gurgling
such
as
might
result
from
a
desperate
attempt
to
shriek
with
a
black
hand
fastened
over
the
victim
mouth
a
clump
of
figures
emerged
from
the
shadows
beyond
the
huts
and
started
down
the
road
three
huge
black
men
carrying
a
slender
struggling
figure
between
them
conan
caught
the
glimmer
of
pale
limbs
writhing
in
the
starlight
even
as
with
a
convulsive
wrench
the
captive
slipped
from
the
grasp
of
the
brutal
fingers
and
came
flying
up
the
road
a
supple
young
woman
naked
as
the
day
she
was
born
conan
saw
her
plainly
before
she
ran
out
of
the
road
and
into
the
shadows
between
the
huts
the
blacks
were
at
her
heels
and
back
in
the
shadows
the
figures
merged
and
an
intolerable
scream
of
anguish
and
horror
rang
out
stirred
to
red
rage
by
the
ghoulishness
of
the
episode
conan
raced
across
the
road
neither
victim
nor
abductors
were
aware
of
his
presence
until
the
soft
swish
of
the
dust
about
his
feet
brought
them
about
and
then
he
was
almost
upon
them
coming
with
the
gusty
fury
of
a
hill
wind
two
of
the
blacks
turned
to
meet
him
lifting
their
bludgeons
but
they
failed
to
estimate
properly
the
speed
at
which
he
was
coming
one
of
them
was
down
disemboweled
before
he
could
strike
and
wheeling
conan
evaded
the
stroke
of
the
other
cudgel
and
lashed
in
a
whistling
the
black
head
flew
into
the
air
the
headless
body
took
three
staggering
steps
spurting
blood
and
clawing
horribly
at
the
air
with
groping
hands
and
then
slumped
to
the
dust
the
remaining
cannibal
gave
back
with
a
strangled
yell
hurling
his
captive
from
him
she
tripped
and
rolled
in
the
dust
and
the
black
fled
in
blind
panic
toward
the
city
conan
was
at
his
heels
fear
winged
the
black
feet
but
before
they
reached
the
easternmost
hut
he
sensed
death
at
his
back
and
bellowed
like
an
ox
in
the
dog
of
hell
conan
drove
his
sword
between
the
dusky
shoulders
with
such
vengeful
fury
that
the
broad
blade
stood
out
half
its
length
from
the
black
breast
with
a
choking
cry
the
black
stumbled
headlong
and
conan
braced
his
feet
and
dragged
out
his
sword
as
his
victim
fell
only
the
breeze
disturbed
the
leaves
conan
shook
his
head
as
a
lion
shakes
its
mane
and
growled
his
unsatiated
but
no
more
shapes
slunk
from
the
shadows
and
before
the
huts
the
starlit
road
stretched
empty
he
whirled
at
the
quick
patter
of
feet
behind
him
but
it
was
only
the
girl
rushing
to
throw
herself
on
him
and
clasp
his
neck
in
a
desperate
grasp
frantic
from
terror
of
the
abominable
fate
she
had
just
escaped
girl
he
grunted
all
right
how
did
they
catch
you
she
sobbed
something
unintelligible
he
forgot
all
about
aram
baksh
as
he
scrutinized
her
by
the
light
of
the
stars
she
was
white
though
a
very
definite
brunette
obviously
one
of
zamboula
many
mixed
breeds
she
was
tall
with
a
slender
supple
form
as
he
was
in
a
good
position
to
observe
admiration
burned
in
his
fierce
eyes
as
he
looked
down
on
her
splendid
bosom
and
her
lithe
limbs
which
still
quivered
from
fright
and
exertion
he
passed
an
arm
around
her
flexible
waist
and
said
reassuringly
shaking
wench
you
safe
enough
his
touch
seemed
to
restore
her
shaken
sanity
she
tossed
back
her
thick
glossy
locks
and
cast
a
fearful
glance
over
her
shoulder
while
she
pressed
closer
to
the
cimmerian
as
if
seeking
security
in
the
contact
caught
me
in
the
streets
she
muttered
shuddering
in
wait
beneath
a
dark
arch
black
men
like
great
hulking
apes
set
have
mercy
on
me
i
shall
dream
of
it
were
you
doing
out
on
the
streets
this
time
of
night
he
inquired
fascinated
by
the
satiny
feel
of
her
sleek
skin
under
his
questing
fingers
she
raked
back
her
hair
and
stared
blankly
up
into
his
face
she
did
not
seem
aware
of
his
caresses
lover
she
said
lover
drove
me
into
the
streets
he
went
mad
and
tried
to
kill
me
as
i
fled
from
him
i
was
seized
by
those
beasts
like
yours
might
drive
a
man
mad
quoth
conan
running
his
fingers
experimentally
through
her
glossy
tresses
she
shook
her
head
like
one
emerging
from
a
daze
she
no
longer
trembled
and
her
voice
was
steady
was
the
spite
of
a
priest
of
totrasmek
the
high
priest
of
hanuman
who
desires
me
for
himself
the
dog
need
to
curse
him
for
that
grinned
conan
old
hyena
has
better
taste
than
i
thought
she
ignored
the
bluff
compliment
she
was
regaining
her
poise
swiftly
lover
is
a
a
young
turanian
soldier
to
spite
me
totrasmek
gave
him
a
drug
that
drove
him
mad
tonight
he
snatched
up
a
sword
and
came
at
me
to
slay
me
in
his
madness
but
i
fled
from
him
into
the
streets
the
negroes
seized
me
and
brought
me
to
this
was
that
conan
had
already
moved
soundlessly
as
a
shadow
he
drew
her
behind
the
nearest
hut
beneath
the
straggling
palms
they
stood
in
tense
stillness
while
the
low
mutterings
both
had
heard
grew
louder
until
voices
were
distinguishable
a
group
of
negroes
some
nine
or
ten
were
coming
along
the
road
from
the
direction
of
the
city
the
girl
clutched
conan
arm
and
he
felt
the
terrified
quivering
of
her
supple
body
against
his
now
they
could
understand
the
gutturals
of
the
black
men
brothers
have
already
assembled
at
the
pit
said
one
have
had
no
luck
i
hope
they
have
enough
for
us
promised
us
a
man
muttered
another
and
conan
mentally
promised
aram
something
keeps
his
word
grunted
yet
another
a
man
we
have
taken
from
his
tavern
but
we
pay
him
well
i
myself
have
given
him
ten
bales
of
silk
i
stole
from
my
master
it
was
good
silk
by
set
the
blacks
shuffled
past
bare
splay
feet
scuffing
up
the
dust
and
their
voices
dwindled
down
the
road
for
us
those
corpses
are
lying
behind
these
huts
muttered
conan
they
look
in
aram
they
find
another
let
begone
let
us
hasten
begged
the
girl
almost
hysterical
again
lover
is
wandering
somewhere
in
the
streets
alone
the
negroes
may
take
him
devil
of
a
custom
this
is
growled
conan
as
he
led
the
way
toward
the
city
paralleling
the
road
but
keeping
behind
the
huts
and
straggling
trees
do
the
citizens
clean
out
these
black
dogs
are
valuable
slaves
murmured
the
girl
are
so
many
of
them
they
might
revolt
if
they
were
denied
the
flesh
for
which
they
lust
the
people
of
zamboula
know
they
skulk
the
streets
at
night
and
all
are
careful
to
remain
within
locked
doors
except
when
something
unforeseen
happens
as
it
did
to
me
the
blacks
prey
on
anything
they
catch
but
they
seldom
catch
anybody
but
strangers
the
people
of
zamboula
are
not
concerned
with
the
strangers
that
pass
through
the
city
men
as
aram
baksh
sell
these
strangers
to
the
blacks
he
would
not
dare
attempt
such
a
thing
with
a
citizen
conan
spat
in
disgust
and
a
moment
later
led
his
companion
out
into
the
road
which
was
becoming
a
street
with
still
unlighted
houses
on
each
side
slinking
in
the
shadows
was
not
congenial
to
his
nature
do
you
want
to
go
he
asked
the
girl
did
not
seem
to
object
to
his
arm
about
her
waist
my
house
to
rouse
my
servants
she
answered
bid
them
search
for
my
lover
i
do
not
wish
the
city
the
priests
anyone
to
know
of
his
madness
he
he
is
a
young
officer
with
a
promising
future
perhaps
we
can
drive
this
madness
from
him
if
we
can
find
him
find
him
rumbled
conan
makes
you
think
i
want
to
spend
the
night
scouring
the
streets
for
a
lunatic
she
cast
a
quick
glance
into
his
face
and
properly
interpreted
the
gleam
in
his
blue
eyes
any
woman
could
have
known
that
he
would
follow
her
wherever
she
led
for
a
while
at
least
but
being
a
woman
she
concealed
her
knowledge
of
that
fact
she
began
with
a
hint
of
tears
in
her
voice
have
no
one
else
to
ask
for
help
you
have
been
kind
right
he
grunted
right
what
the
young
reprobate
name
alafdhal
i
am
zabibi
a
i
have
danced
often
before
the
satrap
jungir
khan
and
his
mistress
nafertari
and
before
all
the
lords
and
royal
ladies
of
zamboula
totrasmek
desired
me
and
because
i
repulsed
him
he
made
me
the
innocent
tool
of
his
vengeance
against
alafdhal
i
asked
a
love
potion
of
totrasmek
not
suspecting
the
depth
of
his
guile
and
hate
he
gave
me
a
drug
to
mix
with
my
lover
wine
and
he
swore
that
when
alafdhal
drank
it
he
would
love
me
even
more
madly
than
ever
and
grant
my
every
wish
i
mixed
the
drug
secretly
with
my
lover
wine
but
having
drunk
my
lover
went
raving
mad
and
things
came
about
as
i
have
told
you
curse
totrasmek
the
hybrid
snake
ahhh
she
caught
his
arm
convulsively
and
both
stopped
short
they
had
come
into
a
district
of
shops
and
stalls
all
deserted
and
unlighted
for
the
hour
was
late
they
were
passing
an
alley
and
in
its
mouth
a
man
was
standing
motionless
and
silent
his
head
was
lowered
but
conan
caught
the
weird
gleam
of
eery
eyes
regarding
them
unblinkingly
his
skin
crawled
not
with
fear
of
the
sword
in
the
man
hand
but
because
of
the
uncanny
suggestion
of
his
posture
and
silence
they
suggested
madness
conan
pushed
the
girl
aside
and
drew
his
sword
kill
him
she
begged
the
name
of
set
do
not
slay
him
you
are
strong
overpower
him
see
he
muttered
grasping
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
and
clenching
his
left
into
a
fist
he
took
a
wary
step
toward
the
alley
and
with
a
horrible
moaning
laugh
the
turanian
charged
as
he
came
he
swung
his
sword
rising
on
his
toes
as
he
put
all
the
power
of
his
body
behind
the
blows
sparks
flashed
blue
as
conan
parried
the
blade
and
the
next
instant
the
madman
was
stretched
senseless
in
the
dust
from
a
thundering
buffet
of
conan
left
fist
the
girl
ran
forward
he
is
not
he
is
not
conan
bent
swiftly
turned
the
man
on
his
side
and
ran
quick
fingers
over
him
not
hurt
much
he
grunted
at
the
nose
but
likely
to
do
that
after
a
clout
on
the
jaw
he
come
to
after
a
bit
and
maybe
his
mind
will
be
right
in
the
meantime
i
tie
his
wrists
with
his
so
now
where
do
you
want
me
to
take
him
she
knelt
beside
the
senseless
figure
seized
the
bound
hands
and
scanned
them
avidly
then
shaking
her
head
as
if
in
baffled
disappointment
she
rose
she
came
close
to
the
giant
cimmerian
and
laid
her
slender
hands
on
his
arching
breast
her
dark
eyes
like
wet
black
jewels
in
the
starlight
gazed
up
into
his
are
a
man
help
me
totrasmek
must
die
slay
him
for
me
put
my
neck
into
a
turanian
noose
he
grunted
the
slender
arms
strong
as
pliant
steel
were
around
his
corded
neck
her
supple
body
throbbed
against
his
hyrkanians
have
no
love
for
totrasmek
the
priests
of
set
fear
him
he
is
a
mongrel
who
rules
men
by
fear
and
superstition
i
worship
set
and
the
turanians
bow
to
erlik
but
totrasmek
sacrifices
to
hanuman
the
accursed
the
turanian
lords
fear
his
black
arts
and
his
power
over
the
hybrid
population
and
they
hate
him
if
he
were
slain
in
his
temple
at
night
they
would
not
seek
his
slayer
very
closely
what
of
his
magic
rumbled
the
cimmerian
are
a
she
answered
risk
your
life
is
part
of
your
profession
a
price
he
admitted
will
be
a
price
she
breathed
rising
on
tiptoe
to
gaze
into
his
eyes
the
nearness
of
her
vibrant
body
drove
a
flame
through
his
veins
the
perfume
of
her
breath
mounted
to
his
brain
but
as
his
arms
closed
about
her
supple
figure
she
avoided
them
with
a
lithe
movement
saying
first
serve
me
in
this
matter
your
price
he
spoke
with
some
difficulty
up
my
lover
she
directed
and
the
cimmerian
stooped
and
swung
the
tall
form
easily
to
his
broad
shoulder
at
the
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
could
have
toppled
over
jungir
khan
palace
with
equal
ease
the
girl
murmured
an
endearment
to
the
unconscious
man
and
there
was
no
hypocrisy
in
her
attitude
she
obviously
loved
alafdhal
sincerely
whatever
business
arrangement
she
made
with
conan
would
have
no
bearing
on
her
relationship
with
alafdhal
women
are
more
practical
about
these
things
than
men
me
she
hurried
along
the
street
while
the
cimmerian
strode
easily
after
her
in
no
way
discomforted
by
his
limp
burden
he
kept
a
wary
eye
out
for
black
shadows
skulking
under
arches
but
saw
nothing
suspicious
doubtless
the
men
of
darfar
were
all
gathered
at
the
the
girl
turned
down
a
narrow
side
street
and
presently
knocked
cautiously
at
an
arched
door
almost
instantly
a
wicket
opened
in
the
upper
panel
and
a
black
face
glanced
out
she
bent
close
to
the
opening
whispering
swiftly
bolts
creaked
in
their
sockets
and
the
door
opened
a
giant
black
man
stood
framed
against
the
soft
glow
of
a
copper
lamp
a
quick
glance
showed
conan
the
man
was
not
from
darfar
his
teeth
were
unfiled
and
his
kinky
hair
was
cropped
close
to
his
skull
he
was
from
the
wadai
at
a
word
from
zabibi
conan
gave
the
limp
body
into
the
black
arms
and
saw
the
young
officer
laid
on
a
velvet
divan
he
showed
no
signs
of
returning
consciousness
the
blow
that
had
rendered
him
senseless
might
have
felled
an
ox
zabibi
bent
over
him
for
an
instant
her
fingers
nervously
twining
and
twisting
then
she
straightened
and
beckoned
the
cimmerian
the
door
closed
softly
the
locks
clicked
behind
them
and
the
closing
wicket
shut
off
the
glow
of
the
lamps
in
the
starlight
of
the
street
zabibi
took
conan
hand
her
own
hand
trembled
a
little
will
not
fail
me
he
shook
his
maned
head
massive
against
the
stars
follow
me
to
hanuman
shrine
and
the
gods
have
mercy
on
our
souls
along
the
silent
streets
they
moved
like
phantoms
of
antiquity
they
went
in
silence
perhaps
the
girl
was
thinking
of
her
lover
lying
senseless
on
the
divan
under
the
copper
lamps
or
was
shrinking
with
fear
of
what
lay
ahead
of
them
in
the
shrine
of
hanuman
the
barbarian
was
thinking
only
of
the
woman
moving
so
supplely
beside
him
the
perfume
of
her
scented
hair
was
in
his
nostrils
the
sensuous
aura
of
her
presence
filled
his
brain
and
left
room
for
no
other
thoughts
once
they
heard
the
clank
of
feet
and
drew
into
the
shadows
of
a
gloomy
arch
while
a
squad
of
pelishtim
watchmen
swung
past
there
were
fifteen
of
them
they
marched
in
close
formation
pikes
at
the
ready
and
the
rearmost
men
had
their
broad
brass
shields
slung
on
their
backs
to
protect
them
from
a
from
behind
the
skulking
menace
of
the
black
was
a
threat
even
to
armed
men
as
soon
as
the
clang
of
their
sandals
had
receded
up
the
street
conan
and
the
girl
emerged
from
their
and
hurried
on
a
few
moments
later
they
saw
the
squat
edifice
they
sought
looming
ahead
of
them
the
temple
of
hanuman
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
broad
square
which
lay
silent
and
deserted
beneath
the
stars
a
marble
wall
surrounded
the
shrine
with
a
broad
opening
directly
before
the
portico
this
opening
had
no
gate
or
any
sort
of
barrier
do
the
blacks
seek
their
prey
here
muttered
conan
nothing
to
keep
them
out
of
the
temple
he
could
feel
the
trembling
of
zabibi
body
as
she
pressed
close
to
him
fear
totrasmek
as
all
in
zamboula
fear
him
even
jungir
khan
and
nafertari
come
come
quickly
before
my
courage
flows
from
me
like
water
the
girl
fear
was
evident
but
she
did
not
falter
conan
drew
his
sword
and
strode
ahead
of
her
as
they
advanced
through
the
open
gateway
he
knew
the
hideous
habits
of
the
priests
of
the
east
and
was
aware
that
an
invader
of
hanuman
shrine
might
expect
to
encounter
almost
any
sort
of
nightmare
horror
he
knew
there
was
a
good
chance
that
neither
he
nor
the
girl
would
ever
leave
the
shrine
alive
but
he
had
risked
his
life
too
many
times
before
to
devote
much
thought
to
that
consideration
they
entered
a
court
paved
with
marble
which
gleamed
whitely
in
the
starlight
a
short
flight
of
broad
marble
steps
led
up
to
the
pillared
portico
the
great
bronze
doors
stood
wide
open
as
they
had
stood
for
centuries
but
no
worshippers
burnt
incense
within
in
the
day
men
and
women
might
come
timidly
into
the
shrine
and
place
offerings
to
the
on
the
black
altar
at
night
the
people
shunned
the
temple
of
hanuman
as
hares
shun
the
lair
of
the
serpent
burning
censers
bathed
the
interior
in
a
soft
weird
glow
that
created
an
illusion
of
unreality
near
the
rear
wall
behind
the
black
stone
altar
sat
the
god
with
his
gaze
fixed
for
ever
on
the
open
door
through
which
for
centuries
his
victims
had
come
dragged
by
chains
of
roses
a
faint
groove
ran
from
the
sill
to
the
altar
and
when
conan
foot
felt
it
he
stepped
away
as
quickly
as
if
he
had
trodden
upon
a
snake
that
groove
had
been
worn
by
the
faltering
feet
of
the
multitude
of
those
who
had
died
screaming
on
that
grim
altar
bestial
in
the
uncertain
light
hanuman
leered
with
his
carven
mask
he
sat
not
as
an
ape
would
crouch
but
as
a
man
would
sit
but
his
aspect
was
no
less
simian
for
that
reason
he
was
carved
from
black
marble
but
his
eyes
were
rubies
which
glowed
red
and
lustful
as
the
coals
of
hell
deepest
pits
his
great
hands
lay
upon
his
lap
palms
upward
taloned
fingers
spread
and
grasping
in
the
gross
emphasis
of
his
attributes
in
the
leer
of
his
was
reflected
the
abominable
cynicism
of
the
degenerate
cult
which
deified
him
the
girl
moved
around
the
image
making
toward
the
back
wall
and
when
her
sleek
flank
brushed
against
a
carven
knee
she
shrank
aside
and
shuddered
as
if
a
reptile
had
touched
her
there
was
a
space
of
several
feet
between
the
broad
back
of
the
idol
and
the
marble
wall
with
its
frieze
of
gold
leaves
on
either
hand
flanking
the
idol
an
ivory
door
under
a
gold
arch
was
set
in
the
wall
doors
open
into
each
end
of
a
shaped
corridor
she
said
hurriedly
i
was
in
the
interior
of
the
shrine
once
she
shivered
and
twitched
her
slim
shoulders
at
a
memory
both
terrifying
and
obscene
corridor
is
bent
like
a
horseshoe
with
each
horn
opening
into
this
room
totrasmek
chambers
are
enclosed
within
the
curve
of
the
corridor
and
open
into
it
but
there
is
a
secret
door
in
this
wall
which
opens
directly
into
an
inner
chamber
she
began
to
run
her
hands
over
the
smooth
surface
where
no
crack
or
crevice
showed
conan
stood
beside
her
sword
in
hand
glancing
warily
about
him
the
silence
the
emptiness
of
the
shrine
with
imagination
picturing
what
might
lie
behind
that
wall
made
him
feel
like
a
wild
beast
nosing
a
trap
the
girl
had
found
a
hidden
spring
at
last
a
square
opening
gaped
blackly
in
the
wall
she
screamed
and
even
as
conan
leaped
toward
her
he
saw
that
a
great
misshapen
hand
had
fastened
itself
in
her
hair
she
was
snatched
off
her
feet
and
jerked
through
the
opening
conan
grabbing
ineffectually
at
her
felt
his
fingers
slip
from
a
naked
limb
and
in
an
instant
she
had
vanished
and
the
wall
showed
blank
as
before
only
from
beyond
it
came
briefly
the
muffled
sounds
of
a
struggle
a
scream
faintly
heard
and
a
low
laugh
that
made
conan
blood
congeal
in
his
veins
black
hands
gripping
with
an
oath
the
cimmerian
smote
the
wall
a
terrific
blow
with
the
pommel
of
his
sword
and
the
marble
cracked
and
chipped
but
the
hidden
door
did
not
give
way
and
reason
told
him
that
doubtless
it
had
been
bolted
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
turning
he
sprang
across
the
chamber
to
one
of
the
ivory
doors
he
lifted
his
sword
to
shatter
the
panels
but
on
a
venture
tried
the
door
first
with
his
left
hand
it
swung
open
easily
and
he
glared
into
a
long
corridor
that
curved
away
into
dimness
under
the
weird
light
of
censers
similar
to
those
in
the
shrine
a
heavy
gold
bolt
showed
on
the
jamb
of
the
door
and
he
touched
it
lightly
with
his
finger
tips
the
faint
warmness
of
the
metal
could
have
been
detected
only
by
a
man
whose
faculties
were
akin
to
those
of
a
wolf
that
bolt
had
been
touched
and
therefore
drawn
within
the
last
few
seconds
the
affair
was
taking
on
more
and
more
of
the
aspect
of
a
baited
trap
he
might
have
known
totrasmek
would
know
when
anyone
entered
the
temple
to
enter
the
corridor
would
undoubtedly
be
to
walk
into
whatever
trap
the
priest
had
set
for
him
but
conan
did
not
hesitate
somewhere
in
that
interior
zabibi
was
a
captive
and
from
what
he
knew
of
the
characteristics
of
hanuman
priests
he
was
sure
that
she
needed
help
badly
conan
stalked
into
the
corridor
with
a
pantherish
tread
poised
to
strike
right
or
left
on
his
left
ivory
arched
doors
opened
into
the
corridor
and
he
tried
each
in
turn
all
were
locked
he
had
gone
perhaps
feet
when
the
corridor
bent
sharply
to
the
left
describing
the
curve
the
girl
had
mentioned
a
door
opened
into
this
curve
and
it
gave
under
his
hand
he
was
looking
into
a
broad
square
chamber
somewhat
more
clearly
lighted
than
the
corridor
its
walls
were
of
white
marble
the
floor
of
ivory
the
ceiling
of
fretted
silver
he
saw
divans
of
rich
satin
footstools
of
ivory
a
table
of
some
massive
substance
on
one
of
the
divans
a
man
was
reclining
looking
toward
the
door
he
laughed
as
he
met
the
cimmerian
startled
glare
this
man
was
naked
except
for
a
and
sandals
he
was
with
black
hair
and
restless
black
eyes
that
set
off
a
broad
arrogant
face
in
girth
and
breadth
he
was
enormous
with
huge
limbs
on
which
the
great
muscles
swelled
and
rippled
at
each
slightest
movement
his
hands
were
the
largest
conan
had
ever
seen
the
assurance
of
gigantic
physical
strength
colored
his
every
action
and
inflection
not
enter
barbarian
he
called
mockingly
with
an
exaggerated
gesture
of
invitation
conan
eyes
began
to
smolder
ominously
but
he
trod
warily
into
the
chamber
his
sword
ready
the
devil
are
you
he
growled
am
the
man
answered
long
ago
and
in
another
land
i
had
another
name
but
this
is
a
good
name
and
why
totrasmek
gave
it
to
me
any
temple
wench
can
tell
you
you
his
dog
grunted
conan
curse
your
brown
hide
where
the
wench
you
jerked
through
the
wall
master
entertains
her
laughed
from
beyond
a
door
opposite
the
one
by
which
conan
had
entered
there
sounded
a
woman
scream
faint
and
muffled
in
the
distance
your
soul
conan
took
a
stride
toward
the
door
then
wheeled
with
his
skin
tingling
was
laughing
at
him
and
that
laugh
was
edged
with
menace
that
made
the
hackles
rise
on
conan
neck
and
sent
a
red
wave
of
driving
across
his
vision
he
started
toward
the
knuckles
on
his
showing
white
with
a
swift
motion
the
brown
man
threw
something
at
him
a
shining
crystal
sphere
that
glistened
in
the
weird
light
conan
dodged
instinctively
but
miraculously
the
globe
stopped
short
in
midair
a
few
feet
from
his
face
it
did
not
fall
to
the
floor
it
hung
suspended
as
if
by
invisible
filaments
some
five
feet
above
the
floor
and
as
he
glared
in
amazement
it
began
to
rotate
with
growing
speed
and
as
it
revolved
it
grew
expanded
became
nebulous
it
filled
the
chamber
it
enveloped
him
it
blotted
out
furniture
walls
the
smiling
countenance
of
he
was
lost
in
the
midst
of
a
blinding
bluish
blur
of
whirling
speed
terrific
winds
screamed
past
conan
tugging
tearing
at
him
striving
to
wrench
him
from
his
feet
to
drag
him
into
the
vortex
that
spun
madly
before
him
with
a
choking
cry
conan
lurched
backward
reeled
felt
the
solid
wall
against
his
back
at
the
contact
the
illusion
ceased
to
be
the
whirling
titanic
sphere
vanished
like
a
bursting
bubble
conan
reeled
upright
in
the
room
with
a
gray
mist
coiling
about
his
feet
and
saw
lolling
on
the
divan
shaking
with
silent
laughter
of
a
slut
conan
lunged
at
him
but
the
mist
swirled
up
from
the
floor
blotting
out
that
giant
brown
form
groping
in
a
rolling
cloud
that
blinded
him
conan
felt
a
rending
sensation
of
dislocation
and
then
room
and
mist
and
brown
man
were
gone
together
he
was
standing
alone
among
the
high
reeds
of
a
marshy
fen
and
a
buffalo
was
lunging
at
him
head
down
he
leaped
aside
from
the
ripping
horns
and
drove
his
sword
in
behind
the
foreleg
through
ribs
and
heart
and
then
it
was
not
a
buffalo
dying
there
in
the
mud
but
the
with
a
curse
conan
struck
off
his
head
and
the
head
soared
from
the
ground
and
snapped
tusks
into
his
throat
for
all
his
mighty
strength
he
could
not
tear
it
loose
he
was
choking
strangling
then
there
was
a
rush
and
roar
through
space
the
dislocating
shock
of
an
immeasurable
impact
and
he
was
back
in
the
chamber
with
whose
head
was
once
more
set
firmly
on
his
shoulders
and
who
laughed
silently
at
him
from
the
divan
muttered
conan
crouching
and
digging
his
toes
hard
against
the
marble
his
eyes
blazed
this
brown
dog
was
playing
with
him
making
sport
of
him
but
this
mummery
this
child
play
of
mists
and
shadows
of
thought
it
could
not
harm
him
he
had
but
to
leap
and
strike
and
the
brown
acolyte
would
be
a
mangled
corpse
under
his
heel
this
time
he
would
not
be
fooled
by
shadows
of
illusion
but
he
was
a
snarl
sounded
behind
him
and
he
wheeled
and
struck
in
a
flash
at
the
panther
crouching
to
spring
on
him
from
the
table
even
as
he
struck
the
apparition
vanished
and
his
blade
clashed
deafeningly
on
the
adamantine
surface
instantly
he
sensed
something
abnormal
the
blade
stuck
to
the
table
he
wrenched
at
it
savagely
it
did
not
give
this
was
no
mesmeristic
trick
the
table
was
a
giant
magnet
he
gripped
the
hilt
with
both
hands
when
a
voice
at
his
shoulder
brought
him
about
to
face
the
brown
man
who
had
at
last
risen
from
the
divan
slightly
taller
than
conan
and
much
heavier
loomed
before
him
a
daunting
image
of
muscular
development
his
mighty
arms
were
unnaturally
long
and
his
great
hands
opened
and
closed
twitching
convulsively
conan
released
the
hilt
of
his
imprisoned
sword
and
fell
silent
watching
his
enemy
through
slitted
lids
head
cimmerian
taunted
shall
take
it
with
my
bare
hands
twisting
it
from
your
shoulders
as
the

blood
and
we
waste
not
a
drop
from
the
victim
veins
when
i
was
a
child
they
gave
me
infants
to
throttle
when
i
was
a
boy
i
strangled
young
girls
as
a
youth
women
old
men
and
young
boys
not
until
i
reached
my
full
manhood
was
i
given
a
strong
man
to
slay
on
the
altar
of
years
i
offered
the
sacrifices
to
yajur
hundreds
of
necks
have
snapped
between
these
fingers
he
worked
them
before
the
angry
eyes
i
fled
from
to
become
totrasmek
servant
is
no
concern
of
yours
in
a
moment
you
will
be
beyond
curiosity
the
priests
of
kosala
the
stranglers
of
yajur
are
strong
beyond
the
belief
of
men
and
i
was
stronger
than
any
with
my
hands
barbarian
i
shall
break
your
neck
and
like
the
stroke
of
twin
cobras
the
great
hands
closed
on
throat
the
cimmerian
made
no
attempt
to
dodge
or
fend
them
away
but
his
own
hands
darted
to
the
kosalan
black
eyes
widened
as
he
felt
the
thick
cords
of
muscles
that
protected
the
barbarian
throat
with
a
snarl
he
exerted
his
inhuman
strength
and
knots
and
lumps
and
ropes
of
thews
rose
along
his
massive
arms
and
then
a
choking
gasp
burst
from
him
as
conan
fingers
locked
on
his
throat
for
an
instant
they
stood
there
like
statues
their
faces
masks
of
effort
veins
beginning
to
stand
out
purply
on
their
temples
thin
lips
drew
back
from
his
teeth
in
a
grinning
snarl
eyes
were
distended
in
them
grew
an
awful
surprize
and
the
glimmer
of
fear
both
men
stood
motionless
as
images
except
for
the
expanding
of
their
muscles
on
rigid
arms
and
braced
legs
but
strength
beyond
common
conception
was
warring
there
strength
that
might
have
uprooted
trees
and
crushed
the
skulls
of
bullocks
the
wind
whistled
suddenly
from
between
parted
teeth
his
face
was
growing
purple
fear
flooded
his
eyes
his
thews
seemed
ready
to
burst
from
his
arms
and
shoulders
yet
the
muscles
of
the
thick
neck
did
not
give
they
felt
like
masses
of
woven
iron
cords
under
his
desperate
fingers
but
his
own
flesh
was
giving
way
under
the
iron
fingers
of
the
cimmerian
which
ground
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
yielding
crushing
them
in
upon
jugular
and
windpipe
the
statuesque
immobility
of
the
group
gave
way
to
sudden
frenzied
motion
as
the
kosalan
began
to
wrench
and
heave
seeking
to
throw
himself
backward
he
let
go
of
conan
throat
and
grasped
his
wrists
trying
to
tear
away
those
inexorable
fingers
with
a
sudden
lunge
conan
bore
him
backward
until
the
small
of
his
back
crashed
against
the
table
and
still
farther
over
its
edge
conan
bent
him
back
and
back
until
his
spine
was
ready
to
snap
conan
low
laugh
was
merciless
as
the
ring
of
steel
fool
he
all
but
whispered
think
you
never
saw
a
man
from
the
west
before
did
you
deem
yourself
strong
because
you
were
able
to
twist
the
heads
off
civilized
folk
poor
weaklings
with
muscles
like
rotten
string
hell
break
the
neck
of
a
wild
cimmerian
bull
before
you
call
yourself
strong
i
did
that
before
i
was
a
man
like
this
and
with
a
savage
wrench
he
twisted
head
around
until
the
ghastly
face
leered
over
the
left
shoulder
and
the
vertebrae
snapped
like
a
rotten
branch
conan
hurled
the
flopping
corpse
to
the
floor
turned
to
the
sword
again
and
gripped
the
hilt
with
both
hands
bracing
his
feet
against
the
floor
blood
trickled
down
his
broad
breast
from
the
wounds
finger
nails
had
torn
in
the
skin
of
his
neck
his
black
hair
was
damp
sweat
ran
down
his
face
and
his
chest
heaved
for
all
his
vocal
scorn
of
strength
he
had
almost
met
his
match
in
the
inhuman
kosalan
but
without
pausing
to
catch
his
breath
he
exerted
all
his
strength
in
a
mighty
wrench
that
tore
the
sword
from
the
magnet
where
it
clung
another
instant
and
he
had
pushed
open
the
door
from
behind
which
the
scream
had
sounded
and
was
looking
down
a
long
straight
corridor
lined
with
ivory
doors
the
other
end
was
masked
by
a
rich
velvet
curtain
and
from
beyond
that
curtain
came
the
devilish
strains
of
such
music
as
conan
had
never
heard
not
even
in
nightmares
it
made
the
short
hairs
bristle
on
the
back
of
his
neck
mingled
with
it
was
the
panting
hysterical
sobbing
of
a
woman
grasping
his
sword
firmly
he
glided
down
the
corridor
dance
girl
dance
when
zabibi
was
jerked
through
the
aperture
which
opened
in
the
wall
behind
the
idol
her
first
dizzy
disconnected
thought
was
that
her
time
had
come
she
instinctively
shut
her
eyes
and
waited
for
the
blow
to
fall
but
instead
she
felt
herself
dumped
unceremoniously
onto
the
smooth
marble
floor
which
bruised
her
knees
and
hip
opening
her
eyes
she
stared
fearfully
around
her
just
as
a
muffled
impact
sounded
from
beyond
the
wall
she
saw
a
giant
in
a
standing
over
her
and
across
the
chamber
into
which
she
had
come
a
man
sat
on
a
divan
with
his
back
to
a
rich
velvet
curtain
a
broad
fleshy
man
with
fat
white
hands
and
snaky
eyes
and
her
flesh
crawled
for
this
man
was
totrasmek
the
priest
of
hanuman
who
for
years
had
spun
his
slimy
webs
of
power
throughout
the
city
of
zamboula
barbarian
seeks
to
batter
his
way
through
the
wall
said
totrasmek
sardonically
the
bolt
will
hold
the
girl
saw
that
a
heavy
golden
bolt
had
been
shot
across
the
hidden
door
which
was
plainly
discernible
from
this
side
of
the
wall
the
bolt
and
its
sockets
would
have
resisted
the
charge
of
an
elephant
open
one
of
the
doors
for
him
ordered
totrasmek
him
in
the
square
chamber
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
the
kosalan
salaamed
and
departed
by
the
way
of
a
door
in
the
side
wall
of
the
chamber
zabibi
rose
staring
fearfully
at
the
priest
whose
eyes
ran
avidly
over
her
splendid
figure
to
this
she
was
indifferent
a
dancer
of
zamboula
was
accustomed
to
nakedness
but
the
cruelty
in
his
eyes
started
her
limbs
to
quivering
you
come
to
me
in
my
retreat
beautiful
one
he
purred
with
cynical
hypocrisy
is
an
unexpected
honor
you
seemed
to
enjoy
your
former
visit
so
little
that
i
dared
not
hope
for
you
to
repeat
it
yet
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
provide
you
with
an
interesting
experience
for
a
zamboulan
dancer
to
blush
would
be
an
impossibility
but
a
smolder
of
anger
mingled
with
the
fear
in
zabibi
dilated
eyes
pig
you
know
i
did
not
come
here
for
love
of
you
laughed
totrasmek
came
like
a
fool
creeping
through
the
night
with
a
stupid
barbarian
to
cut
my
throat
why
should
you
seek
my
life
know
why
she
cried
knowing
the
futility
of
trying
to
dissemble
are
thinking
of
your
lover
he
laughed
fact
that
you
are
here
seeking
my
life
shows
that
he
quaffed
the
drug
i
gave
you
well
did
you
not
ask
for
it
and
did
i
not
send
what
you
asked
for
out
of
the
love
i
bear
you
asked
you
for
a
drug
that
would
make
him
slumber
harmlessly
for
a
few
hours
she
said
bitterly
you
you
sent
your
servant
with
a
drug
that
drove
him
mad
i
was
a
fool
ever
to
trust
you
i
might
have
known
your
protestations
of
friendship
were
lies
to
disguise
your
hate
and
spite
did
you
wish
your
lover
to
sleep
he
retorted
you
could
steal
from
him
the
only
thing
he
would
never
give
you
the
ring
with
the
jewel
men
call
the
star
of
khorala
the
star
stolen
from
the
queen
of
ophir
who
would
pay
a
roomful
of
gold
for
its
return
he
would
not
give
it
to
you
willingly
because
he
knew
that
it
holds
a
magic
which
when
properly
controlled
will
enslave
the
hearts
of
any
of
the
opposite
sex
you
wished
to
steal
it
from
him
fearing
that
his
magicians
would
discover
the
key
to
that
magic
and
he
would
forget
you
in
his
conquests
of
the
queens
of
the
world
you
would
sell
it
back
to
the
queen
of
ophir
who
understands
its
power
and
would
use
it
to
enslave
men
as
she
did
before
it
was
stolen
why
did
want
it
she
demanded
sulkily
understand
its
powers
it
would
increase
the
power
of
my
arts
she
snapped
have
it
now
have
the
star
of
khorala
nay
you
err
bother
to
lie
she
retorted
bitterly
had
it
on
his
finger
when
he
drove
me
into
the
streets
he
did
not
have
it
when
i
found
him
again
your
servant
must
have
been
watching
the
house
and
have
taken
it
from
him
after
i
escaped
him
to
the
devil
with
it
i
want
my
lover
back
sane
and
whole
you
have
the
ring
you
have
punished
us
both
why
do
you
not
restore
his
mind
to
him
can
you
could
he
assured
her
in
evident
enjoyment
of
her
distress
he
drew
a
phial
from
among
his
robes
contains
the
juice
of
the
golden
lotus
if
your
lover
drank
it
he
would
be
sane
again
yes
i
will
be
merciful
you
have
both
thwarted
and
flouted
me
not
once
but
many
times
he
has
constantly
opposed
my
wishes
but
i
will
be
merciful
come
and
take
the
phial
from
my
hand
she
stared
at
totrasmek
trembling
with
eagerness
to
seize
it
but
fearing
it
was
but
some
cruel
jest
she
advanced
timidly
with
a
hand
extended
and
he
laughed
heartlessly
and
drew
back
out
of
her
reach
even
as
her
lips
parted
to
curse
him
some
instinct
snatched
her
eyes
upward
from
the
gilded
ceiling
four
vessels
were
falling
she
dodged
but
they
did
not
strike
her
they
crashed
to
the
floor
about
her
forming
the
four
corners
of
a
square
and
she
screamed
and
screamed
again
for
out
of
each
ruin
reared
the
hooded
head
of
a
cobra
and
one
struck
at
her
bare
leg
her
convulsive
movement
to
evade
it
brought
her
within
reach
of
the
one
on
the
other
side
and
again
she
had
to
shift
like
lightning
to
avoid
the
flash
of
its
hideous
head
she
was
caught
in
a
frightful
trap
all
four
serpents
were
swaying
and
striking
at
foot
ankle
calf
knee
thigh
hip
whatever
portion
of
her
voluptuous
body
chanced
to
be
nearest
to
them
and
she
could
not
spring
over
them
or
pass
between
them
to
safety
she
could
only
whirl
and
spring
aside
and
twist
her
body
to
avoid
the
strokes
and
each
time
she
moved
to
dodge
one
snake
the
motion
brought
her
within
range
of
another
so
that
she
had
to
keep
shifting
with
the
speed
of
light
she
could
move
only
a
short
space
in
any
direction
and
the
fearful
hooded
crests
were
menacing
her
every
second
only
a
dancer
of
zamboula
could
have
lived
in
that
grisly
square
she
became
herself
a
blur
of
bewildering
motion
the
heads
missed
her
by
hair
breadths
but
they
missed
as
she
pitted
her
twinkling
feet
flickering
limbs
and
perfect
eye
against
the
blinding
speed
of
the
scaly
demons
her
enemy
had
conjured
out
of
thin
air
somewhere
a
thin
whining
music
struck
up
mingling
with
the
hissing
of
the
serpents
like
an
evil
blowing
through
the
empty
sockets
of
a
skull
even
in
the
flying
speed
of
her
urgent
haste
she
realized
that
the
darting
of
the
serpents
was
no
longer
at
random
they
obeyed
the
grisly
piping
of
the
eery
music
they
struck
with
a
horrible
rhythm
and
perforce
her
swaying
writhing
spinning
body
attuned
itself
to
their
rhythm
her
frantic
motions
melted
into
the
measures
of
a
dance
compared
to
which
the
most
obscene
tarantella
of
zamora
would
have
seemed
sane
and
restrained
sick
with
shame
and
terror
zabibi
heard
the
hateful
mirth
of
her
merciless
tormentor
dance
of
the
cobras
my
lovely
one
laughed
totrasmek
maidens
danced
in
the
sacrifice
to
hanuman
centuries
ago
but
never
with
such
beauty
and
suppleness
dance
girl
dance
how
long
can
you
avoid
the
fangs
of
the
poison
people
minutes
hours
you
will
weary
at
last
your
swift
sure
feet
will
stumble
your
legs
falter
your
hips
slow
in
their
rotations
then
the
fangs
will
begin
to
sink
deep
into
your
ivory
flesh
behind
him
the
curtain
shook
as
if
struck
by
a
gust
of
wind
and
totrasmek
screamed
his
eyes
dilated
and
his
hands
caught
convulsively
at
the
length
of
bright
steel
which
jutted
suddenly
from
his
breast
the
music
broke
off
short
the
girl
swayed
dizzily
in
her
dance
crying
out
in
dreadful
anticipation
of
the
flickering
fangs
and
then
only
four
wisps
of
harmless
blue
smoke
curled
up
from
the
floor
about
her
as
totrasmek
sprawled
headlong
from
the
divan
conan
came
from
behind
the
curtain
wiping
his
broad
blade
looking
through
the
hangings
he
had
seen
the
girl
dancing
desperately
between
four
swaying
spirals
of
smoke
but
he
had
guessed
that
their
appearance
was
very
different
to
her
he
knew
he
had
killed
totrasmek
zabibi
sank
down
on
the
floor
panting
but
even
as
conan
started
toward
her
she
staggered
up
again
though
her
legs
trembled
with
exhaustion
phial
she
gasped
phial
totrasmek
still
grasped
it
in
his
stiffening
hand
ruthlessly
she
tore
it
from
his
locked
fingers
and
then
began
frantically
to
ransack
his
garments
the
devil
are
you
looking
for
conan
demanded
ring
he
stole
it
from
alafdhal
he
must
have
while
my
lover
walked
in
madness
through
the
streets
set
devils
she
had
convinced
herself
that
it
was
not
on
the
person
of
totrasmek
she
began
to
cast
about
the
chamber
tearing
up
and
hangings
and
upsetting
vessels
she
paused
and
raked
a
damp
lock
of
hair
out
of
her
eyes
forgot
in
hell
with
his
neck
broken
conan
assured
her
she
expressed
vindictive
gratification
at
the
news
but
an
instant
later
swore
expressively
ca
stay
here
it
not
many
hours
until
dawn
lesser
priests
are
likely
to
visit
the
temple
at
any
hour
of
the
night
and
if
discovered
here
with
his
corpse
the
people
will
tear
us
to
pieces
the
turanians
could
not
save
us
she
lifted
the
bolt
on
the
secret
door
and
a
few
moments
later
they
were
in
the
streets
and
hurrying
away
from
the
silent
square
where
brooded
the
shrine
of
hanuman
in
a
winding
street
a
short
distance
away
conan
halted
and
checked
his
companion
with
a
heavy
hand
on
her
naked
shoulder
forget
there
was
a
price
have
not
forgotten
she
twisted
free
we
must
go
to
to
alafdhal
first
a
few
minutes
later
the
black
slave
let
them
through
the
wicket
door
the
young
turanian
lay
upon
the
divan
his
arms
and
legs
bound
with
heavy
velvet
ropes
his
eyes
were
open
but
they
were
like
those
of
a
mad
dog
and
foam
was
thick
on
his
lips
zabibi
shuddered
his
jaws
open
she
commanded
and
conan
iron
fingers
accomplished
the
task
zabibi
emptied
the
phial
down
the
maniac
gullet
the
effect
was
like
magic
instantly
he
became
quiet
the
glare
faded
from
his
eyes
he
stared
up
at
the
girl
in
a
puzzled
way
but
with
recognition
and
intelligence
then
he
fell
into
a
normal
slumber
he
awakes
he
will
be
quite
sane
she
whispered
motioning
to
the
silent
slave
with
a
deep
bow
he
gave
into
her
hands
a
small
leathern
bag
and
drew
about
her
shoulders
a
silken
cloak
her
manner
had
subtly
changed
when
she
beckoned
conan
to
follow
her
out
of
the
chamber
in
an
arch
that
opened
on
the
street
she
turned
to
him
drawing
herself
up
with
a
new
regality
must
now
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
am
not
zabibi
i
am
nafertari
and
is
not
alafdhal
a
poor
captain
of
the
guardsmen
he
is
jungir
khan
satrap
of
zamboula
conan
made
no
comment
his
scarred
dark
countenance

you

i
dared
not
divulge
the
truth
to
anyone
she
said
were
alone
when
jungir
khan
went
mad
none
knew
of
it
but
myself
had
it
been
known
that
the
satrap
of
zamboula
was
a
madman
there
would
have
been
instant
revolt
and
rioting
even
as
totrasmek
planned
who
plotted
our
destruction
see
now
how
impossible
is
the
reward
for
which
you
hoped
the
satrap
mistress
is
not
can
not
be
for
you
but
you
shall
not
go
unrewarded
here
is
a
sack
of
gold
she
gave
him
the
bag
she
had
received
from
the
slave
now
and
when
the
sun
is
come
up
to
the
palace
i
will
have
jungir
khan
make
you
captain
of
his
guard
but
you
will
take
your
orders
from
me
secretly
your
first
duty
will
be
to
march
a
squad
to
the
shrine
of
hanuman
ostensibly
to
search
for
clues
of
the
priest
slayer
in
reality
to
search
for
the
star
of
khorala
it
must
be
hidden
there
somewhere
when
you
find
it
bring
it
to
me
you
have
my
leave
to
go
now
he
nodded
still
silent
and
strode
away
the
girl
watching
the
swing
of
his
broad
shoulders
was
piqued
to
note
that
there
was
nothing
in
his
bearing
to
show
that
he
was
in
any
way
chagrined
or
abashed
when
he
had
rounded
a
corner
he
glanced
back
and
then
changed
his
direction
and
quickened
his
pace
a
few
moments
later
he
was
in
the
quarter
of
the
city
containing
the
horse
market
there
he
smote
on
a
door
until
from
the
window
above
a
bearded
head
was
thrust
to
demand
the
reason
for
the
disturbance
horse
demanded
conan
swiftest
steed
you
have
open
no
gates
at
this
time
of
night
grumbled
the
conan
rattled
his
coins
son
knave
do
you
see
i
white
and
alone
come
down
before
i
smash
your
door
presently
on
a
bay
stallion
conan
was
riding
toward
the
house
of
aram
baksh
he
turned
off
the
road
into
the
alley
that
lay
between
the
tavern
compound
and
the
garden
but
he
did
not
pause
at
the
gate
he
rode
on
to
the
northeast
corner
of
the
wall
then
turned
and
rode
along
the
north
wall
to
halt
within
a
few
paces
of
the
northwest
angle
no
trees
grew
near
the
wall
but
there
were
some
low
bushes
to
one
of
these
he
tied
his
horse
and
was
about
to
climb
into
the
saddle
again
when
he
heard
a
low
muttering
of
voices
beyond
the
corner
of
the
wall
drawing
his
foot
from
the
stirrup
he
stole
to
the
angle
and
peered
around
it
three
men
were
moving
down
the
road
toward
the
palm
groves
and
from
their
slouching
gait
he
knew
they
were
negroes
they
halted
at
his
low
call
bunching
themselves
as
he
strode
toward
them
his
sword
in
his
hand
their
eyes
gleamed
whitely
in
the
starlight
their
brutish
lust
shone
in
their
ebony
faces
but
they
knew
their
three
cudgels
could
not
prevail
against
his
sword
just
as
he
knew
it
are
you
going
he
challenged
bid
our
brothers
put
out
the
fire
in
the
pit
beyond
the
groves
was
the
sullen
guttural
reply
baksh
promised
us
a
man
but
he
lied
we
found
one
of
our
brothers
dead
in
the
we
go
hungry
this
night
think
not
smiled
conan
baksh
will
give
you
a
man
do
you
see
that
door
he
pointed
to
a
small
portal
set
in
the
midst
of
the
western
wall
there
aram
baksh
will
give
you
a
man
backing
warily
away
until
he
was
out
of
reach
of
a
sudden
bludgeon
blow
he
turned
and
melted
around
the
northwest
angle
of
the
wall
reaching
his
horse
he
paused
to
ascertain
that
the
blacks
were
not
sneaking
after
him
and
then
he
climbed
into
the
saddle
and
stood
upright
on
it
quieting
the
uneasy
steed
with
a
low
word
he
reached
up
grasped
the
coping
of
the
wall
and
drew
himself
up
and
over
there
he
studied
the
grounds
for
an
instant
the
tavern
was
built
in
the
southwest
corner
of
the
enclosure
the
remaining
space
of
which
was
occupied
by
groves
and
gardens
he
saw
no
one
in
the
grounds
the
tavern
was
dark
and
silent
and
he
knew
all
the
doors
and
windows
were
barred
and
bolted
conan
knew
that
aram
baksh
slept
in
a
chamber
that
opened
into
a
path
that
led
to
the
door
in
the
western
wall
like
a
shadow
he
glided
among
the
trees
and
a
few
moments
later
he
rapped
lightly
on
the
chamber
door
is
it
asked
a
rumbling
voice
within
baksh
hissed
conan
blacks
are
stealing
over
the
wall
almost
instantly
the
door
opened
framing
the
naked
but
for
his
shirt
with
a
dagger
in
his
hand
he
craned
his
neck
to
stare
into
the
cimmerian
face
tale
is
this
conan
vengeful
fingers
strangled
the
yell
in
his
throat
they
went
to
the
floor
together
and
conan
wrenched
the
dagger
from
his
enemy
hand
the
blade
glinted
in
the
starlight
and
blood
spurted
aram
baksh
made
hideous
noises
gasping
and
gagging
on
a
mouthful
of
blood
conan
dragged
him
to
his
feet
and
again
the
dagger
slashed
and
most
of
the
curly
beard
fell
to
the
floor
still
gripping
his
captive
throat
for
a
man
can
scream
incoherently
even
with
his
tongue
slit
conan
dragged
him
out
of
the
dark
chamber
and
down
the
path
to
the
door
in
the
outer
wall
with
one
hand
he
lifted
the
bolt
and
threw
the
door
open
disclosing
the
three
shadowy
figures
which
waited
like
black
vultures
outside
into
their
eager
arms
conan
thrust
the
innkeeper
a
horrible
scream
rose
from
the
zamboulan
throat
but
there
was
no
response
from
the
silent
tavern
the
people
there
were
used
to
screams
outside
the
wall
aram
baksh
fought
like
a
wild
man
his
distended
eyes
turned
frantically
on
the
cimmerian
face
he
found
no
mercy
there
conan
was
thinking
of
the
scores
of
wretches
who
owed
their
bloody
doom
to
this
man
greed
in
glee
the
negroes
dragged
him
down
the
road
mocking
his
frenzied
gibberings
how
could
they
recognize
aram
baksh
in
this
bloodstained
figure
with
the
grotesquely
shorn
beard
and
unintelligible
babblings
the
sounds
of
the
struggle
came
back
to
conan
standing
beside
the
gate
even
after
the
clump
of
figures
had
vanished
among
the
palms
closing
the
door
behind
him
conan
returned
to
his
horse
mounted
and
turned
westward
toward
the
open
desert
swinging
wide
to
skirt
the
sinister
belt
of
palm
groves
as
he
rode
he
drew
from
his
belt
a
ring
in
which
gleamed
a
jewel
that
snared
the
starlight
in
a
shimmering
iridescence
he
held
it
up
to
admire
it
turning
it
this
way
and
that
the
compact
bag
of
gold
pieces
clinked
gently
at
his
like
a
promise
of
the
greater
riches
to
come
wonder
what
she
say
if
she
knew
i
recognized
her
as
nafertari
and
him
as
jungir
khan
the
instant
i
saw
them
he
mused
knew
the
star
of
khorala
too
there
be
a
fine
scene
if
she
ever
guesses
that
i
slipped
it
off
his
finger
while
i
was
tying
him
with
his
but
they
never
catch
me
with
the
start
i
getting
he
glanced
back
at
the
shadowy
palm
groves
among
which
a
red
glare
was
mounting
a
chanting
rose
to
the
night
vibrating
with
savage
exultation
and
another
sound
mingled
with
it
a
mad
incoherent
screaming
a
frenzied
gibbering
in
which
no
words
could
be
distinguished
the
noise
followed
conan
as
he
rode
westward
beneath
the
paling
stars
