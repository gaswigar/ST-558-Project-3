way
of
peace

as
a
man
thinketh
out
from
the
heart
contents
the
power
of
meditation
the
two
masters
self
and
truth
the
acquirement
of
spiritual
power
the
realization
of
selfless
love
entering
into
the
infinite
saints
sages
and
saviors
the
law
of
service
the
realization
of
perfect
peace
the
power
of
meditation
spiritual
meditation
is
the
pathway
to
divinity
it
is
the
mystic
ladder
which
reaches
from
earth
to
heaven
from
error
to
truth
from
pain
to
peace
every
saint
has
climbed
it
every
sinner
must
sooner
or
later
come
to
it
and
every
weary
pilgrim
that
turns
his
back
upon
self
and
the
world
and
sets
his
face
resolutely
toward
the
father
home
must
plant
his
feet
upon
its
golden
rounds
without
its
aid
you
can
not
grow
into
the
divine
state
the
divine
likeness
the
divine
peace
and
the
fadeless
glories
and
unpolluting
joys
of
truth
will
remain
hidden
from
you
meditation
is
the
intense
dwelling
in
thought
upon
an
idea
or
theme
with
the
object
of
thoroughly
comprehending
it
and
whatsoever
you
constantly
meditate
upon
you
will
not
only
come
to
understand
but
will
grow
more
and
more
into
its
likeness
for
it
will
become
incorporated
into
your
very
being
will
become
in
fact
your
very
self
if
therefore
you
constantly
dwell
upon
that
which
is
selfish
and
debasing
you
will
ultimately
become
selfish
and
debased
if
you
ceaselessly
think
upon
that
which
is
pure
and
unselfish
you
will
surely
become
pure
and
unselfish
tell
me
what
that
is
upon
which
you
most
frequently
and
intensely
think
that
to
which
in
your
silent
hours
your
soul
most
naturally
turns
and
i
will
tell
you
to
what
place
of
pain
or
peace
you
are
traveling
and
whether
you
are
growing
into
the
likeness
of
the
divine
or
the
bestial
there
is
an
unavoidable
tendency
to
become
literally
the
embodiment
of
that
quality
upon
which
one
most
constantly
thinks
let
therefore
the
object
of
your
meditation
be
above
and
not
below
so
that
every
time
you
revert
to
it
in
thought
you
will
be
lifted
up
let
it
be
pure
and
unmixed
with
any
selfish
element
so
shall
your
heart
become
purified
and
drawn
nearer
to
truth
and
not
defiled
and
dragged
more
hopelessly
into
error
meditation
in
the
spiritual
sense
in
which
i
am
now
using
it
is
the
secret
of
all
growth
in
spiritual
life
and
knowledge
every
prophet
sage
and
savior
became
such
by
the
power
of
meditation
buddha
meditated
upon
the
truth
until
he
could
say
i
am
the
truth
jesus
brooded
upon
the
divine
immanence
until
at
last
he
could
declare
i
and
my
father
are
one
meditation
centered
upon
divine
realities
is
the
very
essence
and
soul
of
prayer
it
is
the
silent
reaching
of
the
soul
toward
the
eternal
mere
petitionary
prayer
without
meditation
is
a
body
without
a
soul
and
is
powerless
to
lift
the
mind
and
heart
above
sin
and
affliction
if
you
are
daily
praying
for
wisdom
for
peace
for
loftier
purity
and
a
fuller
realization
of
truth
and
that
for
which
you
pray
is
still
far
from
you
it
means
that
you
are
praying
for
one
thing
while
living
out
in
thought
and
act
another
if
you
will
cease
from
such
waywardness
taking
your
mind
off
those
things
the
selfish
clinging
to
which
debars
you
from
the
possession
of
the
stainless
realities
for
which
you
pray
if
you
will
no
longer
ask
god
to
grant
you
that
which
you
do
not
deserve
or
to
bestow
upon
you
that
love
and
compassion
which
you
refuse
to
bestow
upon
others
but
will
commence
to
think
and
act
in
the
spirit
of
truth
you
will
day
by
day
be
growing
into
those
realities
so
that
ultimately
you
will
become
one
with
them
he
who
would
secure
any
worldly
advantage
must
be
willing
to
work
vigorously
for
it
and
he
would
be
foolish
indeed
who
waiting
with
folded
hands
expected
it
to
come
to
him
for
the
mere
asking
do
not
then
vainly
imagine
that
you
can
obtain
the
heavenly
possessions
without
making
an
effort
only
when
you
commence
to
work
earnestly
in
the
kingdom
of
truth
will
you
be
allowed
to
partake
of
the
bread
of
life
and
when
you
have
by
patient
and
uncomplaining
effort
earned
the
spiritual
wages
for
which
you
ask
they
will
not
be
withheld
from
you
if
you
really
seek
truth
and
not
merely
your
own
gratification
if
you
love
it
above
all
worldly
pleasures
and
gains
more
even
than
happiness
itself
you
will
be
willing
to
make
the
effort
necessary
for
its
achievement
if
you
would
be
freed
from
sin
and
sorrow
if
you
would
taste
of
that
spotless
purity
for
which
you
sigh
and
pray
if
you
would
realize
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
would
enter
into
the
possession
of
profound
and
abiding
peace
come
now
and
enter
the
path
of
meditation
and
let
the
supreme
object
of
your
meditation
be
truth
at
the
outset
meditation
must
be
distinguished
from
there
is
nothing
dreamy
and
unpractical
about
it
it
is
process
of
searching
and
uncompromising
thought
which
allows
nothing
to
remain
but
the
simple
and
naked
thus
meditating
you
will
no
longer
strive
to
build
yourself
up
in
your
prejudices
but
forgetting
self
you
will
remember
only
that
you
are
seeking
the
truth
and
so
you
will
remove
one
by
one
the
errors
which
you
have
built
around
yourself
in
the
past
and
will
patiently
wait
for
the
revelation
of
truth
which
will
come
when
your
errors
have
been
sufficiently
removed
in
the
silent
humility
of
your
heart
you
will
realize
that
there
is
an
inmost
centre
in
us
all
where
truth
abides
in
fulness
and
around
wall
upon
wall
the
gross
flesh
hems
it
in
this
perfect
clear
perception
which
is
truth
a
baffling
and
perverting
carnal
mesh
blinds
it
and
makes
all
error
and
to
know
rather
consists
in
opening
out
a
way
whence
the
imprisoned
splendour
may
escape
than
in
effecting
entry
for
a
light
supposed
to
be
without
select
some
portion
of
the
day
in
which
to
meditate
and
keep
that
period
sacred
to
your
purpose
the
best
time
is
the
very
early
morning
when
the
spirit
of
repose
is
upon
everything
all
natural
conditions
will
then
be
in
your
favor
the
passions
after
the
long
bodily
fast
of
the
night
will
be
subdued
the
excitements
and
worries
of
the
previous
day
will
have
died
away
and
the
mind
strong
and
yet
restful
will
be
receptive
to
spiritual
instruction
indeed
one
of
the
first
efforts
you
will
be
called
upon
to
make
will
be
to
shake
off
lethargy
and
indulgence
and
if
you
refuse
you
will
be
unable
to
advance
for
the
demands
of
the
spirit
are
imperative
to
be
spiritually
awakened
is
also
to
be
mentally
and
physically
awakened
the
sluggard
and
the
can
have
no
knowledge
of
truth
he
who
possessed
of
health
and
strength
wastes
the
calm
precious
hours
of
the
silent
morning
in
drowsy
indulgence
is
totally
unfit
to
climb
the
heavenly
heights
he
whose
awakening
consciousness
has
become
alive
to
its
lofty
possibilities
who
is
beginning
to
shake
off
the
darkness
of
ignorance
in
which
the
world
is
enveloped
rises
before
the
stars
have
ceased
their
vigil
and
grappling
with
the
darkness
within
his
soul
strives
by
holy
aspiration
to
perceive
the
light
of
truth
while
the
unawakened
world
dreams
on
the
heights
by
great
men
reached
and
kept
were
not
attained
by
sudden
flight
but
they
while
their
companions
slept
were
toiling
upward
in
the
night
no
saint
no
holy
man
no
teacher
of
truth
ever
lived
who
did
not
rise
early
in
the
morning
jesus
habitually
rose
early
and
climbed
the
solitary
mountains
to
engage
in
holy
communion
buddha
always
rose
an
hour
before
sunrise
and
engaged
in
meditation
and
all
his
disciples
were
enjoined
to
do
the
same
if
you
have
to
commence
your
daily
duties
at
a
very
early
hour
and
are
thus
debarred
from
giving
the
early
morning
to
systematic
meditation
try
to
give
an
hour
at
night
and
should
this
by
the
length
and
laboriousness
of
your
daily
task
be
denied
you
you
need
not
despair
for
you
may
turn
your
thoughts
upward
in
holy
meditation
in
the
intervals
of
your
work
or
in
those
few
idle
minutes
which
you
now
waste
in
aimlessness
and
should
your
work
be
of
that
kind
which
becomes
by
practice
automatic
you
may
meditate
while
engaged
upon
it
that
eminent
christian
saint
and
philosopher
jacob
boehme
realized
his
vast
knowledge
of
divine
things
whilst
working
long
hours
as
a
shoemaker
in
every
life
there
is
time
to
think
and
the
busiest
the
most
laborious
is
not
shut
out
from
aspiration
and
meditation
spiritual
meditation
and
are
inseparable
you
will
therefore
commence
to
meditate
upon
yourself
so
as
to
try
and
understand
yourself
for
remember
the
great
object
you
will
have
in
view
will
be
the
complete
removal
of
all
your
errors
in
order
that
you
may
realize
truth
you
will
begin
to
question
your
motives
thoughts
and
acts
comparing
them
with
your
ideal
and
endeavoring
to
look
upon
them
with
a
calm
and
impartial
eye
in
this
manner
you
will
be
continually
gaining
more
of
that
mental
and
spiritual
equilibrium
without
which
men
are
but
helpless
straws
upon
the
ocean
of
life
if
you
are
given
to
hatred
or
anger
you
will
meditate
upon
gentleness
and
forgiveness
so
as
to
become
acutely
alive
to
a
sense
of
your
harsh
and
foolish
conduct
you
will
then
begin
to
dwell
in
thoughts
of
love
of
gentleness
of
abounding
forgiveness
and
as
you
overcome
the
lower
by
the
higher
there
will
gradually
silently
steal
into
your
heart
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
law
of
love
with
an
understanding
of
its
bearing
upon
all
the
intricacies
of
life
and
conduct
and
in
applying
this
knowledge
to
your
every
thought
word
and
act
you
will
grow
more
and
more
gentle
more
and
more
loving
more
and
more
divine
and
thus
with
every
error
every
selfish
desire
every
human
weakness
by
the
power
of
meditation
is
it
overcome
and
as
each
sin
each
error
is
thrust
out
a
fuller
and
clearer
measure
of
the
light
of
truth
illumines
the
pilgrim
soul
thus
meditating
you
will
be
ceaselessly
fortifying
yourself
against
your
only
enemy
your
selfish
perishable
self
and
will
be
establishing
yourself
more
and
more
firmly
in
the
divine
and
imperishable
self
that
is
inseparable
from
truth
the
direct
outcome
of
your
meditations
will
be
a
calm
spiritual
strength
which
will
be
your
stay
and
in
the
struggle
of
life
great
is
the
overcoming
power
of
holy
thought
and
the
strength
and
knowledge
gained
in
the
hour
of
silent
meditation
will
enrich
the
soul
with
saving
remembrance
in
the
hour
of
strife
of
sorrow
or
of
temptation
as
by
the
power
of
meditation
you
grow
in
wisdom
you
will
relinquish
more
and
more
your
selfish
desires
which
are
fickle
impermanent
and
productive
of
sorrow
and
pain
and
will
take
your
stand
with
increasing
steadfastness
and
trust
upon
unchangeable
principles
and
will
realize
heavenly
rest
the
use
of
meditation
is
the
acquirement
of
a
knowledge
of
eternal
principles
and
the
power
which
results
from
meditation
is
the
ability
to
rest
upon
and
trust
those
principles
and
so
become
one
with
the
eternal
the
end
of
meditation
is
therefore
direct
knowledge
of
truth
god
and
the
realization
of
divine
and
profound
peace
let
your
meditations
take
their
rise
from
the
ethical
ground
which
you
now
occupy
remember
that
you
are
to
into
truth
by
steady
perseverance
if
you
are
an
orthodox
christian
meditate
ceaselessly
upon
the
spotless
purity
and
divine
excellence
of
the
character
of
jesus
and
apply
his
every
precept
to
your
inner
life
and
outward
conduct
so
as
to
approximate
more
and
more
toward
his
perfection
do
not
be
as
those
religious
ones
who
refusing
to
meditate
upon
the
law
of
truth
and
to
put
into
practice
the
precepts
given
to
them
by
their
master
are
content
to
formally
worship
to
cling
to
their
particular
creeds
and
to
continue
in
the
ceaseless
round
of
sin
and
suffering
strive
to
rise
by
the
power
of
meditation
above
all
selfish
clinging
to
partial
gods
or
party
creeds
above
dead
formalities
and
lifeless
ignorance
thus
walking
the
high
way
of
wisdom
with
mind
fixed
upon
the
spotless
truth
you
shall
know
no
short
of
the
realization
of
truth
he
who
earnestly
meditates
first
perceives
a
truth
as
it
were
afar
off
and
then
realizes
it
by
daily
practice
it
is
only
the
doer
of
the
word
of
truth
that
can
know
of
the
doctrine
of
truth
for
though
by
pure
thought
the
truth
is
perceived
it
is
only
actualized
by
practice
said
the
divine
gautama
the
buddha
he
who
gives
himself
up
to
vanity
and
does
not
give
himself
up
to
meditation
forgetting
the
real
aim
of
life
and
grasping
at
pleasure
will
in
time
envy
him
who
has
exerted
himself
in
meditation
and
he
instructed
his
disciples
in
the
following
five
great
meditations
the
first
meditation
is
the
meditation
of
love
in
which
you
so
adjust
your
heart
that
you
long
for
the
weal
and
welfare
of
all
beings
including
the
happiness
of
your
enemies
the
second
meditation
is
the
meditation
of
pity
in
which
you
think
of
all
beings
in
distress
vividly
representing
in
your
imagination
their
sorrows
and
anxieties
so
as
to
arouse
a
deep
compassion
for
them
in
your
soul
the
third
meditation
is
the
meditation
of
joy
in
which
you
think
of
the
prosperity
of
others
and
rejoice
with
their
rejoicings
the
fourth
meditation
is
the
meditation
of
impurity
in
which
you
consider
the
evil
consequences
of
corruption
the
effects
of
sin
and
diseases
how
trivial
often
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
and
how
fatal
its
consequences
the
fifth
meditation
is
the
meditation
on
serenity
in
which
you
rise
above
love
and
hate
tyranny
and
oppression
wealth
and
want
and
regard
your
own
fate
with
impartial
calmness
and
perfect
tranquillity
by
engaging
in
these
meditations
the
disciples
of
the
buddha
arrived
at
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
whether
you
engage
in
these
particular
meditations
or
not
matters
little
so
long
as
your
object
is
truth
so
long
as
you
hunger
and
thirst
for
that
righteousness
which
is
a
holy
heart
and
a
blameless
life
in
your
meditations
therefore
let
your
heart
grow
and
expand
with
love
until
freed
from
all
hatred
and
passion
and
condemnation
it
embraces
the
whole
universe
with
thoughtful
tenderness
as
the
flower
opens
its
petals
to
receive
the
morning
light
so
open
your
soul
more
and
more
to
the
glorious
light
of
truth
soar
upward
upon
the
wings
of
aspiration
be
fearless
and
believe
in
the
loftiest
possibilities
believe
that
a
life
of
absolute
meekness
is
possible
believe
that
a
life
of
stainless
purity
is
possible
believe
that
a
life
of
perfect
holiness
is
possible
believe
that
the
realization
of
the
highest
truth
is
possible
he
who
so
believes
climbs
rapidly
the
heavenly
hills
whilst
the
unbelievers
continue
to
grope
darkly
and
painfully
in
the
valleys
so
believing
so
aspiring
so
meditating
divinely
sweet
and
beautiful
will
be
your
spiritual
experiences
and
glorious
the
revelations
that
will
enrapture
your
inward
vision
as
you
realize
the
divine
love
the
divine
justice
the
divine
purity
the
perfect
law
of
good
or
god
great
will
be
your
bliss
and
deep
your
peace
old
things
will
pass
away
and
all
things
will
become
new
the
veil
of
the
material
universe
so
dense
and
impenetrable
to
the
eye
of
error
so
thin
and
gauzy
to
the
eye
of
truth
will
be
lifted
and
the
spiritual
universe
will
be
revealed
time
will
cease
and
you
will
live
only
in
eternity
change
and
mortality
will
no
more
cause
you
anxiety
and
sorrow
for
you
will
become
established
in
the
unchangeable
and
will
dwell
in
the
very
heart
of
immortality
star
of
wisdom
star
that
of
the
birth
of
vishnu
birth
of
krishna
buddha
jesus
told
the
wise
ones
heavenward
looking
waiting
watching
for
thy
gleaming
in
the
darkness
of
the
in
the
starless
gloom
of
midnight
shining

ancient

of
holy
vishnu
light
of
krishna
buddha
jesus
the
two
masters
self
and
truth
upon
the
battlefield
of
the
human
soul
two
masters
are
ever
contending
for
the
crown
of
supremacy
for
the
kingship
and
dominion
of
the
heart
the
master
of
self
called
also
the
prince
of
this
world
and
the
master
of
truth
called
also
the
father
god
the
master
self
is
that
rebellious
one
whose
weapons
are
passion
pride
avarice
vanity
implements
of
darkness
the
master
truth
is
that
meek
and
lowly
one
whose
weapons
are
gentleness
patience
purity
sacrifice
humility
love
instruments
of
light
in
every
soul
the
battle
is
waged
and
as
a
soldier
can
not
engage
at
once
in
two
opposing
armies
so
every
heart
is
enlisted
either
in
the
ranks
of
self
or
of
truth
there
is
no
course
there
is
self
and
there
is
truth
where
self
is
truth
is
not
where
truth
is
self
is
not
thus
spake
buddha
the
teacher
of
truth
and
jesus
the
manifested
christ
declared
that
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
and
love
the
other
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
and
despise
the
other
ye
can
not
serve
god
and
mammon
truth
is
so
simple
so
absolutely
undeviating
and
uncompromising
that
it
admits
of
no
complexity
no
turning
no
qualification
self
is
ingenious
crooked
and
governed
by
subtle
and
snaky
desire
admits
of
endless
turnings
and
qualifications
and
the
deluded
worshipers
of
self
vainly
imagine
that
they
can
gratify
every
worldly
desire
and
at
the
same
time
possess
the
truth
but
the
lovers
of
truth
worship
truth
with
the
sacrifice
of
self
and
ceaselessly
guard
themselves
against
worldliness
and
do
you
seek
to
know
and
to
realize
truth
then
you
must
be
prepared
to
sacrifice
to
renounce
to
the
uttermost
for
truth
in
all
its
glory
can
only
be
perceived
and
known
when
the
last
vestige
of
self
has
disappeared
the
eternal
christ
declared
that
he
who
would
be
his
disciple
must
deny
himself
daily
are
you
willing
to
deny
yourself
to
give
up
your
lusts
your
prejudices
your
opinions
if
so
you
may
enter
the
narrow
way
of
truth
and
find
that
peace
from
which
the
world
is
shut
out
the
absolute
denial
the
utter
extinction
of
self
is
the
perfect
state
of
truth
and
all
religions
and
philosophies
are
but
so
many
aids
to
this
supreme
attainment
self
is
the
denial
of
truth
truth
is
the
denial
of
self
as
you
let
self
die
you
will
be
reborn
in
truth
as
you
cling
to
self
truth
will
be
hidden
from
you
whilst
you
cling
to
self
your
path
will
be
beset
with
difficulties
and
repeated
pains
sorrows
and
disappointments
will
be
your
lot
there
are
no
difficulties
in
truth
and
coming
to
truth
you
will
be
freed
from
all
sorrow
and
disappointment
truth
in
itself
is
not
hidden
and
dark
it
is
always
revealed
and
is
perfectly
transparent
but
the
blind
and
wayward
self
can
not
perceive
it
the
light
of
day
is
not
hidden
except
to
the
blind
and
the
light
of
truth
is
not
hidden
except
to
those
who
are
blinded
by
self
truth
is
the
one
reality
in
the
universe
the
inward
harmony
the
perfect
justice
the
eternal
love
nothing
can
be
added
to
it
nor
taken
from
it
it
does
not
depend
upon
any
man
but
all
men
depend
upon
it
you
can
not
perceive
the
beauty
of
truth
while
you
are
looking
out
through
the
eyes
of
self
if
you
are
vain
you
will
color
everything
with
your
own
vanities
if
lustful
your
heart
and
mind
will
be
so
clouded
with
the
smoke
and
flames
of
passion
that
everything
will
appear
distorted
through
them
if
proud
and
opinionative
you
will
see
nothing
in
the
whole
universe
except
the
magnitude
and
importance
of
your
own
opinions
there
is
one
quality
which
distinguishes
the
man
of
truth
from
the
man
of
self
and
that
is
to
be
not
only
free
from
vanity
stubbornness
and
egotism
but
to
regard
one
own
opinions
as
of
no
value
this
indeed
is
true
humility
he
who
is
immersed
in
self
regards
his
own
opinions
as
truth
and
the
opinions
of
other
men
as
error
but
that
humble
who
has
learned
to
distinguish
between
opinion
and
truth
regards
all
men
with
the
eye
of
charity
and
does
not
seek
to
defend
his
opinions
against
theirs
but
sacrifices
those
opinions
that
he
may
love
the
more
that
he
may
manifest
the
spirit
of
truth
for
truth
in
its
very
nature
is
ineffable
and
can
only
be
lived
he
who
has
most
of
charity
has
most
of
truth
men
engage
in
heated
controversies
and
foolishly
imagine
they
are
defending
the
truth
when
in
reality
they
are
merely
defending
their
own
petty
interests
and
perishable
opinions
the
follower
of
self
takes
up
arms
against
others
the
follower
of
truth
takes
up
arms
against
himself
truth
being
unchangeable
and
eternal
is
independent
of
your
opinion
and
of
mine
we
may
enter
into
it
or
we
may
stay
outside
but
both
our
defense
and
our
attack
are
superfluous
and
are
hurled
back
upon
ourselves
men
enslaved
by
self
passionate
proud
and
condemnatory
believe
their
particular
creed
or
religion
to
be
the
truth
and
all
other
religions
to
be
error
and
they
proselytize
with
passionate
ardor
there
is
but
one
religion
the
religion
of
truth
there
is
but
one
error
the
error
of
self
truth
is
not
a
formal
belief
it
is
an
unselfish
holy
and
aspiring
heart
and
he
who
has
truth
is
at
peace
with
all
and
cherishes
all
with
thoughts
of
love
you
may
easily
know
whether
you
are
a
child
of
truth
or
a
worshiper
of
self
if
you
will
silently
examine
your
mind
heart
and
conduct
do
you
harbor
thoughts
of
suspicion
enmity
envy
lust
pride
or
do
you
strenuously
fight
against
these
if
the
former
you
are
chained
to
self
no
matter
what
religion
you
may
profess
if
the
latter
you
are
a
candidate
for
truth
even
though
outwardly
you
may
profess
no
religion
are
you
passionate
ever
seeking
to
gain
your
own
ends
and
or
are
you
gentle
mild
unselfish
quit
of
every
form
of
and
are
ever
ready
to
give
up
your
own
if
the
former
self
is
your
master
if
the
latter

is
the
object

you

you

power

leadership
are
you
given
to
ostentation
and
or
have
you
given
up
the
love
of
riches
have
you
relinquished
all
strife
are
you
content
to
take
the
lowest
place
and
to
be
passed
by
unnoticed
and
have
you
ceased

talk
about
yourself
and
to

yourself
with
pride
if
the
former
even
though
you
may
imagine
you
worship

the

nobly

an
unrevengeful
spirit
never

too
high
such
be
the
signs
o
indian
prince
of
him
whose
feet
are
set
on
that
fair
path
which
leads
to
heavenly
birth
when
men
lost
in
the
devious
ways
of
error
and
self
have
forgotten
the
heavenly
birth
the
state
of
holiness
and
truth
they
set
up
artificial
standards
by
which
to
judge
one
another
and
make
acceptance
of
and
adherence
to
their
own
particular
theology
the
test
of
truth
and
so
men
are
divided
one
against
another
and
there
is
ceaseless
enmity
and
strife
and
unending
sorrow
and
suffering
reader
do
you
seek
to
realize
the
birth
into
truth
there
is
only
one
way
self
all
those
lusts
appetites
desires
opinions
limited
conceptions
and
prejudices
to
which
you
have
hitherto
so
tenaciously
clung
let
them
fall
from
you
let
them
no
longer
hold
you
in
bondage
and
truth
will
be
yours
cease
to
look
upon
your
own
religion
as
superior
to
all
others
and
strive
humbly
to
learn
the
supreme
lesson
of
charity
no
longer
cling
to
the
idea
so
productive
of
strife
and
sorrow
that
the
savior
whom
you
worship
is
the
only
savior
and
that
the
savior
whom
your
brother
worships
with
equal
sincerity
and
ardor
is
an
impostor
but
seek
diligently
the
path
of
holiness
and
then
you
will
realize
that
every
holy
man
is
a
savior
of
mankind
the
giving
up
of
self
is
not
merely
the
renunciation
of
outward
things
it
consists
of
the
renunciation
of
the
inward
sin
the
inward
error
not
by
giving
up
vain
clothing
not
by
relinquishing
riches
not
by
abstaining
from
certain
foods
not
by
speaking
smooth
words
not
by
merely
doing
these
things
is
the
truth
found
but
by
giving
up
the
spirit
of
vanity
by
relinquishing
the
desire
for
riches
by
abstaining
from
the
lust
of
by
giving
up
all
hatred
strife
condemnation
and
and
becoming
gentle
and
pure
at
heart
by
doing
these
things
is
the
truth
found
to
do
the
former
and
not
to
do
the
latter
is
pharisaism
and
hypocrisy
whereas
the
latter
includes
the
former
you
may
renounce
the
outward
world
and
isolate
yourself
in
a
cave
or
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
but
you
will
take
all
your
selfishness
with
you
and
unless
you
renounce
that
great
indeed
will
be
your
wretchedness
and
deep
your
delusion
you
may
remain
just
where
you
are
performing
all
your
duties
and
yet
renounce
the
world
the
inward
enemy
to
be
in
the
world
and
yet
not
of
the
world
is
the
highest
perfection
the
most
blessed
peace
is
to
achieve
the
greatest
victory
the
renunciation
of
self
is
the
way
of
truth
therefore
enter
the
path
there
is
no
grief
like
hate
no
pain
like
passion
no
deceit
like
sense
enter
the
path
far
hath
he
gone
whose
foot
treads
down
one
fond
offense
as
you
succeed
in
overcoming
self
you
will
begin
to
see
things
in
their
right
relations
he
who
is
swayed
by
any
passion
prejudice
like
or
dislike
adjusts
everything
to
that
particular
bias
and
sees
only
his
own
delusions
he
who
is
absolutely
free
from
all
passion
prejudice
preference
and
partiality
sees
himself
as
he
is
sees
others
as
they
are
sees
all
things
in
their
proper
proportions
and
right
relations
having
nothing
to
attack
nothing
to
defend
nothing
to
conceal
and
no
interests
to
guard
he
is
at
peace
he
has
realized
the
profound
simplicity
of
truth
for
this
unbiased
tranquil
blessed
state
of
mind
and
heart
is
the
state
of
truth
he
who
attains
to
it
dwells
with
the
angels
and
sits
at
the
footstool
of
the
supreme
knowing
the
great
law
knowing
the
origin
of
sorrow
knowing
the
secret
of
suffering
knowing
the
way
of
emancipation
in
truth
how
can
such
a
one
engage
in
strife
or
condemnation
for
though
he
knows
that
the
blind
world
surrounded
with
the
clouds
of
its
own
illusions
and
enveloped
in
the
darkness
of
error
and
self
can
not
perceive
the
steadfast
light
of
truth
and
is
utterly
incapable
of
comprehending
the
profound
simplicity
of
the
heart
that
has
died
or
is
dying
to
self
yet
he
also
knows
that
when
the
suffering
ages
have
piled
up
mountains
of
sorrow
the
crushed
and
burdened
soul
of
the
world
will
fly
to
its
final
refuge
and
that
when
the
ages
are
completed
every
prodigal
will
come
back
to
the
fold
of
truth
and
so
he
dwells
in
goodwill
toward
all
and
regards
all
with
that
tender
compassion
which
a
father
bestows
upon
his
wayward
children
men
can
not
understand
truth
because
they
cling
to
self
because
they
believe
in
and
love
self
because
they
believe
self
to
be
the
only
reality
whereas
it
is
the
one
delusion
when
you
cease
to
believe
in
and
love
self
you
will
desert
it
and
will
fly
to
truth
and
will
find
the
eternal
reality
when
men
are
intoxicated
with
the
wines
of
luxury
and
pleasure
and
vanity
the
thirst
of
life
grows
and
deepens
within
them
and
they
delude
themselves
with
dreams
of
fleshly
immortality
but
when
they
come
to
reap
the
harvest
of
their
own
sowing
and
pain
and
sorrow
supervene
then
crushed
and
humiliated
relinquishing
self
and
all
the
intoxications
of
self
they
come
with
aching
hearts
to
the
one
immortality
the
immortality
that
destroys
all
delusions
the
spiritual
immortality
in
truth
men
pass
from
evil
to
good
from
self
to
truth
through
the
dark
gate
of
sorrow
for
sorrow
and
self
are
inseparable
only
in
the
peace
and
bliss
of
truth
is
all
sorrow
vanquished
if
you
suffer
disappointment
because
your
cherished
plans
have
been
thwarted
or
because
someone
has
not
come
up
to
your
anticipations
it
is
because
you
are
clinging
to
self
if
you
suffer
remorse
for
your
conduct
it
is
because
you
have
given
way
to
self
if
you
are
overwhelmed
with
chagrin
and
regret
because
of
the
attitude
of
someone
else
toward
you
it
is
because
you
have
been
cherishing
self
if
you
are
wounded
on
account
of
what
has
been
done
to
you
or
said
of
you
it
is
because
you
are
walking
in
the
painful
way
of
self
all
suffering
is
of
self
all
suffering
ends
in
truth
when
you
have
entered
into
and
realized
truth
you
will
no
longer
suffer
disappointment
remorse
and
regret
and
sorrow
will
flee
from
you
self
is
the
only
prison
that
can
ever
bind
the
soul
truth
is
the
only
angel
that
can
bid
the
gates
unroll
and
when
he
comes
to
call
thee
arise
and
follow
fast
his
way
may
lie
through
darkness
but
it
leads
to
light
at
last
the
woe
of
the
world
is
of
its
own
making
sorrow
purifies
and
deepens
the
soul
and
the
extremity
of
sorrow
is
the
prelude
to
truth
have
you
suffered
much
have
you
sorrowed
deeply
have
you
pondered
seriously
upon
the
problem
of
life
if
so
you
are
prepared
to
wage
war
against
self
and
to
become
a
disciple
of
truth
the
intellectual
who
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
giving
up
self
frame
endless
theories
about
the
universe
and
call
them
truth
but
do
thou
pursue
that
direct
line
of
conduct
which
is
the
practice
of
righteousness
and
thou
wilt
realize
the
truth
which
has
no
place
in
theory
and
which
never
changes
cultivate
your
heart
water
it
continually
with
unselfish
love
and
pity
and
strive
to
shut
out
from
it
all
thoughts
and
feelings
which
are
not
in
accordance
with
love
return
good
for
evil
love
for
hatred
gentleness
for
and
remain
silent
when
attacked
so
shall
you
transmute
all
your
selfish
desires
into
the
pure
gold
of
love
and
self
will
disappear
in
truth
so
will
you
walk
blamelessly
among
men
yoked
with
the
easy
yoke
of
lowliness
and
clothed
with
the
divine
garment
of
humility
o
come
weary
brother
thy
struggling
and
striving
end

in
the
heart
of
the
master
of
ruth
across
self
drear
desert
why
wilt
thou
be
driving
athirst
for
the
quickening
waters
of
truth
when
here
by
the
path
of
thy
searching
and
sinning
flows
life
gladsome
stream
lies
love

come
turn
thou
and
rest
know
the
end
and
beginning
the
sought
and
the
searcher
the
seer
and
seen
thy
master
sits
not
in
the
unapproached
mountains
nor
dwells
in
the
mirage
which
floats
on
the
air
nor
shalt
thou
discover
his
magical
fountains
in
pathways
of
sand
that
encircle
despair
in
selfhood
dark
desert
cease
wearily
seeking
the
odorous
tracks
of
the
feet
of
thy
king
and
if
thou
wouldst
hear
the
sweet
sound
of
his
speaking
be
deaf
to
all
voices
that
emptily
sing
flee
the
vanishing
places
renounce
all
thou

leave
all
that

at
the
shrine
of
the
cast
the
highest
the
holiest
the
changeless
is
there
within
in
the
heart
of
the
silence
he
dwelleth
leave
sorrow
and
sin
leave
thy
wanderings
sore
come
bathe
in
his
joy
whilst
he
whispering
telleth
thy
soul
what
it
seeketh
and
wander
no

then
cease
weary

thy
struggling
and
striving

peace
in
the
heart
of
the
master
of
ruth
across
self
dark
desert
cease
wearily
driving
come
drink
at
the
beautiful
waters
of
truth
the
acquirement
of
spiritual
power
the
world
is
filled
with
men
and
women
seeking
pleasure
excitement
novelty
seeking
ever
to
be
moved
to
laughter
or
tears
not
seeking
strength
stability
and
power
but
courting
weakness
and
eagerly
engaged
in
dispersing
what
power
they
have
men
and
women
of
real
power
and
influence
are
few
because
few
are
prepared
to
make
the
sacrifice
necessary
to
the
acquirement
of
power
and
fewer
still
are
ready
to
patiently
build
up
character
to
be
swayed
by
your
fluctuating
thoughts
and
impulses
is
to
be
weak
and
powerless
to
rightly
control
and
direct
those
forces
is
to
be
strong
and
powerful
men
of
strong
animal
passions
have
much
of
the
ferocity
of
the
beast
but
this
is
not
power
the
elements
of
power
are
there
but
it
is
only
when
this
ferocity
is
tamed
and
subdued
by
the
higher
intelligence
that
real
power
begins
and
men
can
only
grow
in
power
by
awakening
themselves
to
higher
and
ever
higher
states
of
intelligence
and
consciousness
the
difference
between
a
man
of
weakness
and
one
of
power
lies
not
in
the
strength
of
the
personal
will
for
the
stubborn
man
is
usually
weak
and
foolish
but
in
that
focus
of
consciousness
which
represents
their
states
of
knowledge
the
the
lovers
of
excitement
the
hunters
after
novelty
and
the
victims
of
impulse
and
hysterical
emotion
lack
that
knowledge
of
principles
which
gives
balance
stability
and
influence
a
man
commences
to
develop
power
when
checking
his
impulses
and
selfish
inclinations
he
falls
back
upon
the
higher
and
calmer
consciousness
within
him
and
begins
to
steady
himself
upon
a
principle
the
realization
of
unchanging
principles
in
consciousness
is
at
once
the
source
and
secret
of
the
highest
power
when
after
much
searching
and
suffering
and
sacrificing
the
light
of
an
eternal
principle
dawns
upon
the
soul
a
divine
calm
ensues
and
joy
unspeakable
gladdens
the
heart
he
who
has
realized
such
a
principle
ceases
to
wander
and
remains
poised
and
he
ceases
to
be
passion
slave
and
becomes
a
in
the
temple
of
destiny
the
man
that
is
governed
by
self
and
not
by
a
principle
changes
his
front
when
his
selfish
comforts
are
threatened
deeply
intent
upon
defending
and
guarding
his
own
interests
he
regards
all
means
as
lawful
that
will
subserve
that
end
he
is
continually
scheming
as
to
how
he
may
protect
himself
against
his
enemies
being
too
to
perceive
that
he
is
his
own
enemy
such
a
man
work
crumbles
away
for
it
is
divorced
from
truth
and
power
all
effort
that
is
grounded
upon
self
perishes
only
that
work
endures
that
is
built
upon
an
indestructible
principle
the
man
that
stands
upon
a
principle
is
the
same
calm
dauntless
man
under
all
circumstances
when
the
hour
of
trial
comes
and
he
has
to
decide
between
his
personal
comforts
and
truth
he
gives
up
his
comforts
and
remains
firm
even
the
prospect
of
torture
and
death
can
not
alter
or
deter
him
the
man
of
self
regards
the
loss
of
his
wealth
his
comforts
or
his
life
as
the
greatest
calamities
which
can
befall
him
the
man
of
principle
looks
upon
these
incidents
as
comparatively
insignificant
and
not
to
be
weighed
with
loss
of
character
loss
of
truth
to
desert
truth
is
to
him
the
only
happening
which
can
really
be
called
a
calamity
it
is
the
hour
of
crisis
which
decides
who
are
the
minions
of
darkness
and
who
the
children
of
light
it
is
the
epoch
of
threatening
disaster
ruin
and
persecution
which
divides
the
sheep
from
the
goats
and
reveals
to
the
reverential
gaze
of
succeeding
ages
the
men
and
women
of
power
it
is
easy
for
a
man
so
long
as
he
is
left
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
possessions
to
persuade
himself
that
he
believes
in
and
adheres
to
the
principles
of
peace
brotherhood
and
universal
love
but
if
when
his
enjoyments
are
threatened
or
he
imagines
they
are
threatened
he
begins
to
clamor
loudly
for
war
he
shows
that
he
believes
in
and
stands
upon
not
peace
brotherhood
and
love
but
strife
selfishness
and
hatred
he
who
does
not
desert
his
principles
when
threatened
with
the
loss
of
every
earthly
thing
even
to
the
loss
of
reputation
and
life
is
the
man
of
power
is
the
man
whose
every
word
and
work
endures
is
the
man
whom
the
afterworld
honors
reveres
and
worships
rather
than
desert
that
principle
of
divine
love
on
which
he
rested
and
in
which
all
his
trust
was
placed
jesus
endured
the
utmost
extremity
of
agony
and
deprivation
and
today
the
world
prostrates
itself
at
his
pierced
feet
in
rapt
adoration
there
is
no
way
to
the
acquirement
of
spiritual
power
except
by
that
inward
illumination
and
enlightenment
which
is
the
realization
of
spiritual
principles
and
those
principles
can
only
be
realized
by
constant
practice
and
application
take
the
principle
of
divine
love
and
quietly
and
diligently
meditate
upon
it
with
the
object
of
arriving
at
a
thorough
understanding
of
it
bring
its
searching
light
to
bear
upon
all
your
habits
your
actions
your
speech
and
intercourse
with
others
your
every
secret
thought
and
desire
as
you
persevere
in
this
course
the
divine
love
will
become
more
and
more
perfectly
revealed
to
you
and
your
own
shortcomings
will
stand
out
in
more
and
more
vivid
contrast
spurring
you
on
to
renewed
endeavor
and
having
once
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
incomparable
majesty
of
that
imperishable
principle
you
will
never
again
rest
in
your
weakness
your
selfishness
your
imperfection
but
will
pursue
that
love
until
you
have
relinquished
every
discordant
element
and
have
brought
yourself
into
perfect
harmony
with
it
and
that
state
of
inward
harmony
is
spiritual
power
take
also
other
spiritual
principles
such
as
purity
and
compassion
and
apply
them
in
the
same
way
and
so
exacting
is
truth
you
will
be
able
to
make
no
stay
no
until
the
inmost
garment
of
your
soul
is
bereft
of
every
stain
and
your
heart
has
become
incapable
of
any
hard
condemnatory
and
pitiless
impulse
only
in
so
far
as
you
understand
realize
and
rely
upon
these
principles
will
you
acquire
spiritual
power
and
that
power
will
be
manifested
in
and
through
you
in
the
form
of
increasing
dispassion
patience
and
equanimity
dispassion
argues
superior
sublime
patience
is
the
very
of
divine
knowledge
and
to
retain
an
unbroken
calm
amid
all
the
duties
and
distractions
of
life
marks
off
the
man
of
power
it
is
easy
in
the
world
to
live
after
the
world
opinion
it
is
easy
in
solitude
to
live
after
our
own
but
the
great
man
is
he
who
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
keeps
with
perfect
sweetness
the
independence
of
solitude
some
mystics
hold
that
perfection
in
dispassion
is
the
source
of
that
power
by
which
miracles
are
performed
and
truly
he
who
has
gained
such
perfect
control
of
all
his
interior
forces
that
no
shock
however
great
can
for
one
moment
unbalance
him
must
be
capable
of
guiding
and
directing
those
forces
with
a
to
grow
in
in
patience
in
equanimity
is
to
grow
in
strength
and
power
and
you
can
only
thus
grow
by
focusing
your
consciousness
upon
a
principle
as
a
child
after
making
many
and
vigorous
attempts
to
walk
unaided
at
last
succeeds
after
numerous
falls
in
accomplishing
this
so
you
must
enter
the
way
of
power
by
first
attempting
to
stand
alone
break
away
from
the
tyranny
of
custom
tradition
conventionality
and
the
opinions
of
others
until
you
succeed
in
walking
lonely
and
erect
among
men
rely
upon
your
own
judgment
be
true
to
your
own
conscience
follow
the
light
that
is
within
you
all
outward
lights
are
so
many
there
will
be
those
who
will
tell
you
that
you
are
foolish
that
your
judgment
is
faulty
that
your
conscience
is
all
awry
and
that
the
light
within
you
is
darkness
but
heed
them
not
if
what
they
say
is
true
the
sooner
you
as
a
searcher
for
wisdom
find
it
out
the
better
and
you
can
only
make
the
discovery
by
bringing
your
powers
to
the
test
therefore
pursue
your
course
bravely
your
conscience
is
at
least
your
own
and
to
follow
it
is
to
be
a
man
to
follow
the
conscience
of
another
is
to
be
a
slave
you
will
have
many
falls
will
suffer
many
wounds
will
endure
many
buffetings
for
a
time
but
press
on
in
faith
believing
that
sure
and
certain
victory
lies
ahead
search
for
a
rock
a
principle
and
having
found
it
cling
to
it
get
it
under
your
feet
and
stand
erect
upon
it
until
at
last
immovably
fixed
upon
it
you
succeed
in
defying
the
fury
of
the
waves
and
storms
of
selfishness
for
selfishness
in
any
and
every
form
is
dissipation
weakness
death
unselfishness
in
its
spiritual
aspect
is
conservation
power
life
as
you
grow
in
spiritual
life
and
become
established
upon
principles
you
will
become
as
beautiful
and
as
unchangeable
as
those
principles
will
taste
of
the
sweetness
of
their
immortal
essence
and
will
realize
the
eternal
and
indestructible
nature
of
the
god
within
no
harmful
shaft
can
reach
the
righteous
man
standing
erect
amid
the
storms
of
hate
defying
hurt
and
injury
and
ban
surrounded
by
the
trembling
slaves
of
fate
majestic
in
the
strength
of
silent
power
serene
he
stands
nor
changes
not
nor
turns
patient
and
firm
in
suffering
darkest
hour
time
bends
to
him
and
death
and
doom
he
spurns
wrath
lurid
lightnings
round
about
him
play
and
hell
deep
thunders
roll
about
his
head
yet
heeds
he
not
for
him
they
can
not
slay
who
stands
whence
earth
and
time
and
space
are
fled
sheltered
by
deathless
love
what
fear
hath
he
armored
in
changeless
truth
what
can
he
know
of
loss
and
gain
knowing
eternity
he
moves
not
whilst
the
shadows
come
and
go
call
him
immortal
call
him
truth
and
light
and
splendor
of
prophetic
majesty
who
bideth
thus
amid
the
powers
of
night
clothed
with
the
glory
of
divinity
the
realization
of
selfless
love
it
is
said
that
michael
angelo
saw
in
every
rough
block
of
stone
a
thing
of
beauty
awaiting
the
to
bring
it
into
reality
even
so
within
each
there
reposes
the
divine
image
awaiting
the
of
faith
and
the
chisel
of
patience
to
bring
it
into
manifestation
and
that
divine
image
is
revealed
and
realized
as
stainless
selfless
love
hidden
deep
in
every
human
heart
though
frequently
covered
up
with
a
mass
of
hard
and
almost
impenetrable
accretions
is
the
spirit
of
divine
love
whose
holy
and
spotless
essence
is
undying
and
eternal
it
is
the
truth
in
man
it
is
that
which
belongs
to
the
supreme
that
which
is
real
and
immortal
all
else
changes
and
passes
away
this
alone
is
permanent
and
imperishable
and
to
realize
this
love
by
ceaseless
diligence
in
the
practice
of
the
highest
righteousness
to
live
in
it
and
to
become
fully
conscious
in
it
is
to
enter
into
immortality
here
and
now
is
to
become
one
with
truth
one
with
god
one
with
the
central
heart
of
all
things
and
to
know
our
own
divine
and
eternal
nature
to
reach
this
love
to
understand
and
experience
it
one
must
work
with
great
persistency
and
diligence
upon
his
heart
and
mind
must
ever
renew
his
patience
and
keep
strong
his
faith
for
there
will
be
much
to
remove
much
to
accomplish
before
the
divine
image
is
revealed
in
all
its
glorious
beauty
he
who
strives
to
reach
and
to
accomplish
the
divine
will
be
tried
to
the
very
uttermost
and
this
is
absolutely
necessary
for
how
else
could
one
acquire
that
sublime
patience
without
which
there
is
no
real
wisdom
no
divinity
ever
and
anon
as
he
proceeds
all
his
work
will
seem
to
be
futile
and
his
efforts
appear
to
be
thrown
away
now
and
then
a
hasty
touch
will
mar
his
image
and
perhaps
when
he
imagines
his
work
is
almost
completed
he
will
find
what
he
imagined
to
be
the
beautiful
form
of
divine
love
utterly
destroyed
and
he
must
begin
again
with
his
past
bitter
experience
to
guide
and
help
him
but
he
who
has
resolutely
set
himself
to
realize
the
highest
recognizes
no
such
thing
as
defeat
all
failures
are
apparent
not
real
every
slip
every
fall
every
return
to
selfishness
is
a
lesson
learned
an
experience
gained
from
which
a
golden
grain
of
wisdom
is
extracted
helping
the
striver
toward
the
accomplishment
of
his
lofty
object
to
recognize
that
of
our
vices
we
can
frame
a
ladder
if
we
will
but
tread
beneath
our
feet
each
deed
of
shame
is
to
enter
the
way
that
leads
unmistakably
toward
the
divine
and
the
failings
of
one
who
thus
recognizes
are
so
many
dead
selves
upon
which
he
rises
as
upon
to
higher
things
once
come
to
regard
your
failings
your
sorrows
and
sufferings
as
so
many
voices
telling
you
plainly
where
you
are
weak
and
faulty
where
you
fall
below
the
true
and
the
divine
you
will
then
begin
to
ceaselessly
watch
yourself
and
every
slip
every
pang
of
pain
will
show
you
where
you
are
to
set
to
work
and
what
you
have
to
remove
out
of
your
heart
in
order
to
bring
it
nearer
to
the
likeness
of
the
divine
nearer
to
the
perfect
love
and
as
you
proceed
day
by
day
detaching
yourself
more
and
more
from
the
inward
selfishness
the
love
that
is
selfless
will
gradually
become
revealed
to
you
and
when
you
are
growing
patient
and
calm
when
your
petulances
tempers
and
irritabilities
are
passing
away
from
you
and
the
more
powerful
lusts
and
prejudices
cease
to
dominate
and
enslave
you
then
you
will
know
that
the
divine
is
awakening
within
you
that
you
are
drawing
near
to
the
eternal
heart
that
you
are
not
far
from
that
selfless
love
the
possession
of
which
is
peace
and
immortality
divine
love
is
distinguished
from
human
loves
in
this
supremely
important
particular
is
free
from
human
loves
cling
to
a
particular
object
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
and
when
that
object
is
removed
great
and
deep
is
the
resultant
suffering
to
the
one
who
loves
divine
love
embraces
the
whole
universe
and
without
clinging
to
any
part
yet
contains
within
itself
the
whole
and
he
who
comes
to
it
by
gradually
purifying
and
broadening
his
human
loves
until
all
the
selfish
and
impure
elements
are
burnt
out
of
them
ceases
from
suffering
it
is
because
human
loves
are
narrow
and
confined
and
mingled
with
selfishness
that
they
cause
suffering
no
suffering
can
result
from
that
love
which
is
so
absolutely
pure
that
it
seeks
nothing
for
itself
nevertheless
human
loves
are
absolutely
necessary
as
steps
toward
the
divine
and
no
soul
is
prepared
to
partake
of
divine
love
until
it
has
become
capable
of
the
deepest
and
most
intense
human
love
it
is
only
by
passing
through
human
loves
and
human
sufferings
that
divine
love
is
reached
and
realized
all
human
loves
are
perishable
like
the
forms
to
which
they
cling
but
there
is
a
love
that
is
imperishable
and
that
does
not
cling
to
appearances
all
human
loves
are
counterbalanced
by
human
hates
but
there
is
a
love
that
admits
of
no
opposite
or
reaction
divine
and
free
from
all
taint
of
self
that
sheds
its
fragrance
on
all
alike
human
loves
are
reflections
of
the
divine
love
and
draw
the
soul
nearer
to
the
reality
the
love
that
knows
neither
sorrow
nor
change
it
is
well
that
the
mother
clinging
with
passionate
tenderness
to
the
little
helpless
form
of
flesh
that
lies
on
her
bosom
should
be
overwhelmed
with
the
dark
waters
of
sorrow
when
she
sees
it
laid
in
the
cold
earth
it
is
well
that
her
tears
should
flow
and
her
heart
ache
for
only
thus
can
she
be
reminded
of
the
evanescent
nature
of
the
joys
and
objects
of
sense
and
be
drawn
nearer
to
the
eternal
and
imperishable
reality
it
is
well
that
lover
brother
sister
husband
wife
should
suffer
deep
anguish
and
be
enveloped
in
gloom
when
the
visible
object
of
their
affections
is
torn
from
them
so
that
they
may
learn
to
turn
their
affections
toward
the
invisible
source
of
all
where
alone
abiding
satisfaction
is
to
be
found
it
is
well
that
the
proud
the
ambitious
the
should
suffer
defeat
humiliation
and
misfortune
that
they
should
pass
through
the
scorching
fires
of
affliction
for
only
thus
can
the
wayward
soul
be
brought
to
reflect
upon
the
enigma
of
life
only
thus
can
the
heart
be
softened
and
purified
and
prepared
to
receive
the
truth
when
the
sting
of
anguish
penetrates
the
heart
of
human
love
when
gloom
and
loneliness
and
desertion
cloud
the
soul
of
friendship
and
trust
then
it
is
that
the
heart
turns
toward
the
sheltering
love
of
the
eternal
and
finds
rest
in
its
silent
peace
and
whosoever
comes
to
this
love
is
not
turned
away
comfortless
is
not
pierced
with
anguish
nor
surrounded
with
gloom
and
is
never
deserted
in
the
dark
hour
of
trial
the
glory
of
divine
love
can
only
be
revealed
in
the
heart
that
is
chastened
by
sorrow
and
the
image
of
the
heavenly
state
can
only
be
perceived
and
realized
when
the
lifeless
formless
accretions
of
ignorance
and
self
are
hewn
away
only
that
love
that
seeks
no
personal
gratification
or
reward
that
does
not
make
distinctions
and
that
leaves
behind
no
heartaches
can
be
called
divine
men
clinging
to
self
and
to
the
comfortless
shadows
of
evil
are
in
the
habit
of
thinking
of
divine
love
as
something
belonging
to
a
god
who
is
out
of
reach
as
something
outside
themselves
and
that
must
for
ever
remain
outside
truly
the
love
of
god
is
ever
beyond
the
reach
of
self
but
when
the
heart
and
mind
are
emptied
of
self
then
the
selfless
love
the
supreme
love
the
love
that
is
of
god
or
good
becomes
an
inward
and
abiding
reality
and
this
inward
realization
of
holy
love
is
none
other
than
the
love
of
christ
that
is
so
much
talked
about
and
so
little
comprehended
the
love
that
not
only
saves
the
soul
from
sin
but
lifts
it
also
above
the
power
of
temptation
but
how
may
one
attain
to
this
sublime
realization
the
answer
which
truth
has
always
given
and
will
ever
give
to
this
question
is
empty
thyself
and
i
will
fill
thee
divine
love
can
not
be
known
until
self
is
dead
for
self
is
the
denial
of
love
and
how
can
that
which
is
known
be
also
denied
not
until
the
stone
of
self
is
rolled
away
from
the
sepulcher
of
the
soul
does
the
immortal
christ
the
pure
spirit
of
love
hitherto
crucified
dead
and
buried
cast
off
the
bands
of
ignorance
and
come
forth
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
resurrection
you
believe
that
the
christ
of
nazareth
was
put
to
death
and
rose
again
i
do
not
say
you
err
in
that
belief
but
if
you
refuse
to
believe
that
the
gentle
spirit
of
love
is
crucified
daily
upon
the
dark
cross
of
your
selfish
desires
then
i
say
you
err
in
this
unbelief
and
have
not
yet
perceived
even
afar
off
the
love
of
christ
you
say
that
you
have
tasted
of
salvation
in
the
love
of
christ
are
you
saved
from
your
temper
your
irritability
your
vanity
your
personal
dislikes
your
judgment
and
condemnation
of
others
if
not
from
what
are
you
saved
and
wherein
have
you
realized
the
transforming
love
of
christ
he
who
has
realized
the
love
that
is
divine
has
become
a
new
man
and
has
ceased
to
be
swayed
and
dominated
by
the
old
elements
of
self
he
is
known
for
his
patience
his
purity
his
his
deep
charity
of
heart
and
his
unalterable
sweetness
divine
or
selfless
love
is
not
a
mere
sentiment
or
emotion
it
is
a
state
of
knowledge
which
destroys
the
dominion
of
evil
and
the
belief
in
evil
and
lifts
the
soul
into
the
joyful
realization
of
the
supreme
good
to
the
divinely
wise
knowledge
and
love
are
one
and
inseparable
it
is
toward
the
complete
realization
of
this
divine
love
that
the
whole
world
is
moving
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
the
universe
came
into
existence
and
every
grasping
at
happiness
every
reaching
out
of
the
soul
toward
objects
ideas
and
ideals
is
an
effort
to
realize
it
but
the
world
does
not
realize
this
love
at
present
because
it
is
grasping
at
the
fleeting
shadow
and
ignoring
in
its
blindness
the
substance
and
so
suffering
and
sorrow
continue
and
must
continue
until
the
world
taught
by
its
pains
discovers
the
love
that
is
selfless
the
wisdom
that
is
calm
and
full
of
peace
and
this
love
this
wisdom
this
peace
this
tranquil
state
of
mind
and
heart
may
be
attained
to
may
be
realized
by
all
who
are
willing
and
ready
to
yield
up
self
and
who
are
prepared
to
humbly
enter
into
a
comprehension
of
all
that
the
giving
up
of
self
involves
there
is
no
arbitrary
power
in
the
universe
and
the
strongest
chains
of
fate
by
which
men
are
bound
are
men
are
chained
to
that
which
causes
suffering
because
they
desire
to
be
so
because
they
love
their
chains
because
they
think
their
little
dark
prison
of
self
is
sweet
and
beautiful
and
they
are
afraid
that
if
they
desert
that
prison
they
will
lose
all
that
is
real
and
worth
having
ye
suffer
from
yourselves
none
else
compels
none
other
holds
ye
that
ye
live
and
die
and
the
indwelling
power
which
forged
the
chains
and
built
around
itself
the
dark
and
narrow
prison
can
break
away
when
it
desires
and
wills
to
do
so
and
the
soul
does
will
to
do
so
when
it
has
discovered
the
worthlessness
of
its
prison
when
long
suffering
has
prepared
it
for
the
reception
of
the
boundless
light
and
love
as
the
shadow
follows
the
form
and
as
smoke
comes
after
fire
so
effect
follows
cause
and
suffering
and
bliss
follow
the
thoughts
and
deeds
of
men
there
is
no
effect
in
the
world
around
us
but
has
its
hidden
or
revealed
cause
and
that
cause
is
in
accordance
with
absolute
justice
men
reap
a
harvest
of
suffering
because
in
the
near
or
distant
past
they
have
sown
the
seeds
of
evil
they
reap
a
harvest
of
bliss
also
as
a
result
of
their
own
sowing
of
the
seeds
of
good
let
a
man
meditate
upon
this
let
him
strive
to
understand
it
and
he
will
then
begin
to
sow
only
seeds
of
good
and
will
burn
up
the
tares
and
weeds
which
he
has
formerly
grown
in
the
garden
of
his
heart
the
world
does
not
understand
the
love
that
is
selfless
because
it
is
engrossed
in
the
pursuit
of
its
own
pleasures
and
cramped
within
the
narrow
limits
of
perishable
interests
mistaking
in
its
ignorance
those
pleasures
and
interests
for
real
and
abiding
things
caught
in
the
flames
of
fleshly
lusts
and
burning
with
anguish
it
sees
not
the
pure
and
peaceful
beauty
of
truth
feeding
upon
the
swinish
husks
of
error
and
it
is
shut
out
from
the
mansion
of
love
not
having
this
love
not
understanding
it
men
institute
innumerable
reforms
which
involve
no
inward
sacrifice
and
each
imagines
that
his
reform
is
going
to
right
the
world
for
ever
while
he
himself
continues
to
propagate
evil
by
engaging
it
in
his
own
heart
that
only
can
be
called
reform
which
tends
to
reform
the
human
heart
for
all
evil
has
its
rise
there
and
not
until
the
world
ceasing
from
selfishness
and
party
strife
has
learned
the
lesson
of
divine
love
will
it
realize
the
golden
age
of
universal
blessedness
let
the
rich
cease
to
despise
the
poor
and
the
poor
to
condemn
the
rich
let
the
greedy
learn
how
to
give
and
the
lustful
how
to
grow
pure
let
the
partisan
cease
from
strife
and
the
uncharitable
begin
to
forgive
let
the
envious
endeavor
to
rejoice
with
others
and
the
slanderers
grow
ashamed
of
their
conduct
let
men
and
women
take
this
course
and
lo
the
golden
age
is
at
hand
he
therefore
who
purifies
his
own
heart
is
the
greatest
benefactor
yet
though
the
world
is
and
will
be
for
many
ages
to
come
shut
out
from
that
age
of
gold
which
is
the
realization
of
selfless
love
you
if
you
are
willing
may
enter
it
now
by
rising
above
your
selfish
self
if
you
will
pass
from
prejudice
hatred
and
condemnation
to
gentle
and
forgiving
love
where
hatred
dislike
and
condemnation
are
selfless
love
does
not
abide
it
resides
only
in
the
heart
that
has
ceased
from
all
condemnation
you
say
how
can
i
love
the
drunkard
the
hypocrite
the
sneak
the
murderer
i
am
compelled
to
dislike
and
condemn
such
men
it
is
true
you
can
not
love
such
men
but
when
you
say
that
you
must
perforce
dislike
and
condemn
them
you
show
that
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
great
love
for
it
is
possible
to
attain
to
such
a
state
of
interior
enlightenment
as
will
enable
you
to
perceive
the
train
of
causes
by
which
these
men
have
become
as
they
are
to
enter
into
their
intense
sufferings
and
to
know
the
certainty
of
their
ultimate
purification
possessed
of
such
knowledge
it
will
be
utterly
impossible
for
you
any
longer
to
dislike
or
condemn
them
and
you
will
always
think
of
them
with
perfect
calmness
and
deep
compassion
if
you
love
people
and
speak
of
them
with
praise
until
they
in
some
way
thwart
you
or
do
something
of
which
you
disapprove
and
then
you
dislike
them
and
speak
of
them
with
dispraise
you
are
not
governed
by
the
love
which
is
of
god
if
in
your
heart
you
are
continually
arraigning
and
condemning
others
selfless
love
is
hidden
from
you
he
who
knows
that
love
is
at
the
heart
of
all
things
and
has
realized
the
power
of
that
love
has
no
room
in
his
heart
for
condemnation
men
not
knowing
this
love
constitute
themselves
judge
and
executioner
of
their
fellows
forgetting
that
there
is
the
eternal
judge
and
executioner
and
in
so
far
as
men
deviate
from
them
in
their
own
views
their
particular
reforms
and
methods
they
brand
them
as
fanatical
unbalanced
lacking
judgment
sincerity
and
honesty
in
so
far
as
others
approximate
to
their
own
standard
do
they
look
upon
them
as
being
everything
that
is
admirable
such
are
the
men
who
are
centered
in
self
but
he
whose
heart
is
centered
in
the
supreme
love
does
not
so
brand
and
classify
men
does
not
seek
to
convert
men
to
his
own
views
not
to
convince
them
of
the
superiority
of
his
methods
knowing
the
law
of
love
he
lives
it
and
maintains
the
same
calm
attitude
of
mind
and
sweetness
of
heart
toward
all
the
debased
and
the
virtuous
the
foolish
and
the
wise
the
learned
and
the
unlearned
the
selfish
and
the
unselfish
receive
alike
the
benediction
of
his
tranquil
thought
you
can
only
attain
to
this
supreme
knowledge
this
divine
love
by
unremitting
endeavor
in
and
by
gaining
victory
after
victory
over
yourself
only
the
pure
in
heart
see
god
and
when
your
heart
is
sufficiently
purified
you
will
enter
into
the
new
birth
and
the
love
that
does
not
die
nor
change
nor
end
in
pain
and
sorrow
will
be
awakened
within
you
and
you
will
be
at
peace
he
who
strives
for
the
attainment
of
divine
love
is
ever
seeking
to
overcome
the
spirit
of
condemnation
for
where
there
is
pure
spiritual
knowledge
condemnation
can
not
exist
and
only
in
the
heart
that
has
become
incapable
of
condemnation
is
love
perfected
and
fully
realized
the
christian
condemns
the
atheist
the
atheist
satirizes
the
christian
the
catholic
and
protestant
are
ceaselessly
engaged
in
wordy
warfare
and
the
spirit
of
strife
and
hatred
rules
where
peace
and
love
should
be
he
that
hateth
his
brother
is
a
murderer
a
crucifier
of
the
divine
spirit
of
love
and
until
you
can
regard
men
of
all
religions
and
of
no
religion
with
the
same
impartial
spirit
with
all
freedom
from
dislike
and
with
perfect
equanimity
you
have
yet
to
strive
for
that
love
which
bestows
upon
its
possessor
freedom
and
salvation
the
realization
of
divine
knowledge
selfless
love
utterly
destroys
the
spirit
of
condemnation
disperses
all
evil
and
lifts
the
consciousness
to
that
height
of
pure
vision
where
love
goodness
justice
are
seen
to
be
universal
supreme
indestructible
train
your
mind
in
strong
impartial
and
gentle
thought
train
your
heart
in
purity
and
compassion
train
your
tongue
to
silence
and
to
true
and
stainless
speech
so
shall
you
enter
the
way
of
holiness
and
peace
and
shall
ultimately
realize
the
immortal
love
so
living
without
seeking
to
convert
you
will
convince
without
arguing
you
will
teach
not
cherishing
ambition
the
wise
will
find
you
out
and
without
striving
to
gain
opinions
you
will
subdue
their
hearts
for
love
is
and
the
thoughts
and
deeds
and
words
of
love
can
never
perish
to
know
that
love
is
universal
supreme
to
be
freed
from
the
trammels
of
evil
to
be
quit
of
the
inward
unrest
to
know
that
all
men
are
striving
to
realize
the
truth
each
in
his
own
way
to
be
satisfied
sorrowless
serene
this
is
peace
this
is
gladness
this
is
immortality
this
is
divinity
this
is
the
realization
of
selfless
love
i
stood
upon
the
shore
and
saw
the
rocks
resist
the
onslaught
of
the
mighty
sea
and
when
i
thought
how
all
the
countless
shocks
they
had
withstood
through
an
eternity
i
said
to
wear
away
this
solid
main
the
ceaseless
efforts
of
the
waves
are
vain
but
when
i
thought
how
they
the
rocks
had
rent
and
saw
the
sand
and
shingles
at
my
feet
poor
passive
remnants
of
resistance
spent
tumbled
and
tossed
where
they
the
waters
meet
then
saw
i
ancient
landmarks
the
waves
and
knew
the
waters
held
the
stones
their
slaves
i
saw
the
mighty
work
the
waters
wrought
by
patient
softness
and
unceasing
flow
how
they
the
proudest
promontory
brought
unto
their
feet
and
massy
hills
laid
low
how
the
soft
drops
the
adamantine
wall
conquered
at
last
and
brought
it
to
its
fall
and
then
i
knew
that
hard
resisting
sin
should
yield
at
last
to
love
soft
ceaseless
roll
coming
and
going
ever
flowing
in
upon
the
proud
rocks
of
the
human
soul
that
all
resistance
should
be
spent
and
past
and
every
heart
yield
unto
it
at
last
entering
into
the
infinite
from
the
beginning
of
time
man
in
spite
of
his
bodily
appetites
and
desires
in
the
midst
of
all
his
clinging
to
earthly
and
impermanent
things
has
ever
been
intuitively
conscious
of
the
limited
transient
and
illusionary
nature
of
his
material
existence
and
in
his
sane
and
silent
moments
has
tried
to
reach
out
into
a
comprehension
of
the
infinite
and
has
turned
with
tearful
aspiration
toward
the
restful
reality
of
the
eternal
heart
while
vainly
imagining
that
the
pleasures
of
earth
are
real
and
satisfying
pain
and
sorrow
continually
remind
him
of
their
unreal
and
unsatisfying
nature
ever
striving
to
believe
that
complete
satisfaction
is
to
be
found
in
material
things
he
is
conscious
of
an
inward
and
persistent
revolt
against
this
belief
which
revolt
is
at
once
a
refutation
of
his
essential
mortality
and
an
inherent
and
imperishable
proof
that
only
in
the
immortal
the
eternal
the
infinite
can
he
find
abiding
satisfaction
and
unbroken
peace
and
here
is
the
common
ground
of
faith
here
the
root
and
spring
of
all
religion
here
the
soul
of
brotherhood
and
the
heart
of
love
that
man
is
essentially
and
spiritually
divine
and
eternal
and
that
immersed
in
mortality
and
troubled
with
unrest
he
is
ever
striving
to
enter
into
a
consciousness
of
his
real
nature
the
spirit
of
man
is
inseparable
from
the
infinite
and
can
be
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
the
infinite
and
the
burden
of
pain
will
continue
to
weigh
upon
man
heart
and
the
shadows
of
sorrow
to
darken
his
pathway
until
ceasing
from
his
wanderings
in
the
of
matter
he
comes
back
to
his
home
in
the
reality
of
the
eternal
as
the
smallest
drop
of
water
detached
from
the
ocean
contains
all
the
qualities
of
the
ocean
so
man
detached
in
consciousness
from
the
infinite
contains
within
him
its
likeness
and
as
the
drop
of
water
must
by
the
law
of
its
nature
ultimately
find
its
way
back
to
the
ocean
and
lose
itself
in
its
silent
depths
so
must
man
by
the
unfailing
law
of
his
nature
at
last
return
to
his
source
and
lose
himself
in
the
great
ocean
of
the
infinite
to
one
with
the
infinite
is
the
goal
of
man
to
enter
into
perfect
harmony
with
the
eternal
law
is
wisdom
love
and
peace
but
this
divine
state
is
and
must
ever
be
incomprehensible
to
the
merely
personal
personality
separateness
selfishness
are
one
and
the
same
and
are
the
antithesis
of
wisdom
and
divinity
by
the
unqualified
surrender
of
the
personality
separateness
and
selfishness
cease
and
man
enters
into
the
possession
of
his
divine
heritage
of
immortality
and
infinity
such
surrender
of
the
personality
is
regarded
by
the
worldly
and
selfish
mind
as
the
most
grievous
of
all
calamities
the
most
irreparable
loss
yet
it
is
the
one
supreme
and
incomparable
blessing
the
only
real
and
lasting
gain
the
mind
unenlightened
upon
the
inner
laws
of
being
and
upon
the
nature
and
destiny
of
its
own
life
clings
to
transient
appearances
things
which
have
in
them
no
enduring
substantiality
and
so
clinging
perishes
for
the
time
being
amid
the
shattered
wreckage
of
its
own
illusions
men
cling
to
and
gratify
the
flesh
as
though
it
were
going
to
last
for
ever
and
though
they
try
to
forget
the
nearness
and
inevitability
of
its
dissolution
the
dread
of
death
and
of
the
loss
of
all
that
they
cling
to
clouds
their
happiest
hours
and
the
chilling
shadow
of
their
own
selfishness
follows
them
like
a
remorseless
specter
and
with
the
accumulation
of
temporal
comforts
and
luxuries
the
divinity
within
men
is
drugged
and
they
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
materiality
into
the
perishable
life
of
the
senses
and
where
there
is
sufficient
intellect
theories
concerning
the
immortality
of
the
flesh
come
to
be
regarded
as
infallible
truths
when
a
man
soul
is
clouded
with
selfishness
in
any
or
every
form
he
loses
the
power
of
spiritual
discrimination
and
confuses
the
temporal
with
the
eternal
the
perishable
with
the
permanent
mortality
with
immortality
and
error
with
truth
it
is
thus
that
the
world
has
come
to
be
filled
with
theories
and
speculations
having
no
foundation
in
human
experience
every
body
of
flesh
contains
within
itself
from
the
hour
of
birth
the
elements
of
its
own
destruction
and
by
the
unalterable
law
of
its
own
nature
must
it
pass
away
the
perishable
in
the
universe
can
never
become
permanent
the
permanent
can
never
pass
away
the
mortal
can
never
become
immortal
the
immortal
can
never
die
the
temporal
can
not
become
eternal
nor
the
eternal
become
temporal
appearance
can
never
become
reality
nor
reality
fade
into
appearance
error
can
never
become
truth
nor
can
truth
become
error
man
can
not
immortalize
the
flesh
but
by
overcoming
the
flesh
by
relinquishing
all
its
inclinations
he
can
enter
the
region
of
immortality
god
alone
hath
immortality
and
only
by
realizing
the
god
state
of
consciousness
does
man
enter
into
immortality
all
nature
in
its
myriad
forms
of
life
is
changeable
impermanent
unenduring
only
the
informing
principle
of
nature
endures
nature
is
many
and
is
marked
by
separation
the
informing
principle
is
one
and
is
marked
by
unity
by
overcoming
the
senses
and
the
selfishness
within
which
is
the
overcoming
of
nature
man
emerges
from
the
chrysalis
of
the
personal
and
illusory
and
wings
himself
into
the
glorious
light
of
the
impersonal
the
region
of
universal
truth
out
of
which
all
perishable
forms
come
let
men
therefore
practice
let
them
conquer
their
animal
inclinations
let
them
refuse
to
be
enslaved
by
luxury
and
pleasure
let
them
practice
virtue
and
grow
daily
into
high
and
ever
higher
virtue
until
at
last
they
grow
into
the
divine
and
enter
into
both
the
practice
and
the
comprehension
of
humility
meekness
forgiveness
compassion
and
love
which
practice
and
comprehension
constitute
divinity
gives
insight
and
only
he
who
has
so
conquered
his
personality
that
he
has
but
one
attitude
of
mind
that
of
toward
all
creatures
is
possessed
of
divine
insight
and
is
capable
of
distinguishing
the
true
from
the
false
the
supremely
good
man
is
therefore
the
wise
man
the
divine
man
the
enlightened
seer
the
knower
of
the
eternal
where
you
find
unbroken
gentleness
enduring
patience
sublime
lowliness
graciousness
of
speech
and
deep
and
abounding
sympathy
look
there
for
the
highest
wisdom
seek
the
company
of
such
a
one
for
he
has
realized
the
divine
he
lives
with
the
eternal
he
has
become
one
with
the
infinite
believe
not
him
that
is
impatient
given
to
anger
boastful
who
clings
to
pleasure
and
refuses
to
renounce
his
selfish
gratifications
and
who
practices
not
and
compassion
for
such
a
one
hath
not
wisdom
vain
is
all
his
knowledge
and
his
works
and
words
will
perish
for
they
are
grounded
on
that
which
passes
away
let
a
man
abandon
self
let
him
overcome
the
world
let
him
deny
the
personal
by
this
pathway
only
can
he
enter
into
the
heart
of
the
infinite
the
world
the
body
the
personality
are
mirages
upon
the
desert
of
time
transitory
dreams
in
the
dark
night
of
spiritual
slumber
and
those
who
have
crossed
the
desert
those
who
are
spiritually
awakened
have
alone
comprehended
the
universal
reality
where
all
appearances
are
dispersed
and
dreaming
and
delusion
are
destroyed
there
is
one
great
law
which
exacts
unconditional
obedience
one
unifying
principle
which
is
the
basis
of
all
diversity
one
eternal
truth
wherein
all
the
problems
of
earth
pass
away
like
shadows
to
realize
this
law
this
unity
this
truth
is
to
enter
into
the
infinite
is
to
become
one
with
the
eternal
to
center
one
life
in
the
great
law
of
love
is
to
enter
into
rest
harmony
peace
to
refrain
from
all
participation
in
evil
and
discord
to
cease
from
all
resistance
to
evil
and
from
the
omission
of
that
which
is
good
and
to
fall
back
upon
unswerving
obedience
to
the
holy
calm
within
is
to
enter
into
the
inmost
heart
of
things
is
to
attain
to
a
living
conscious
experience
of
that
eternal
and
infinite
principle
which
must
ever
remain
a
hidden
mystery
to
the
merely
perceptive
intellect
until
this
principle
is
realized
the
soul
is
not
established
in
peace
and
he
who
so
realizes
is
truly
wise
not
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
the
learned
but
with
the
simplicity
of
a
blameless
heart
and
of
a
divine
manhood
to
enter
into
a
realization
of
the
infinite
and
eternal
is
to
rise
superior
to
time
and
the
world
and
the
body
which
comprise
the
kingdom
of
darkness
and
is
to
become
established
in
immortality
heaven
and
the
spirit
which
make
up
the
empire
of
light
entering
into
the
infinite
is
not
a
mere
theory
or
sentiment
it
is
a
vital
experience
which
is
the
result
of
assiduous
practice
in
inward
purification
when
the
body
is
no
longer
believed
to
be
even
remotely
the
real
man
when
all
appetites
and
desires
are
thoroughly
subdued
and
purified
when
the
emotions
are
rested
and
calm
and
when
the
oscillation
of
the
intellect
ceases
and
perfect
poise
is
secured
then
and
not
till
then
does
consciousness
become
one
with
the
infinite
not
until
then
is
childlike
wisdom
and
profound
peace
secured
men
grow
weary
and
gray
over
the
dark
problems
of
life
and
finally
pass
away
and
leave
them
unsolved
because
they
can
not
see
their
way
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
personality
being
too
much
engrossed
in
its
limitations
seeking
to
save
his
personal
life
man
forfeits
the
greater
impersonal
life
in
truth
clinging
to
the
perishable
he
is
shut
out
from
a
knowledge
of
the
eternal
by
the
surrender
of
self
all
difficulties
are
overcome
and
there
is
no
error
in
the
universe
but
the
fire
of
inward
sacrifice
will
burn
it
up
like
chaff
no
problem
however
great
but
will
disappear
like
a
shadow
under
the
searching
light
of
problems
exist
only
in
our
own
illusions
and
they
vanish
away
when
self
is
yielded
up
self
and
error
are
synonymous
error
is
involved
in
the
darkness
of
unfathomable
complexity
but
eternal
simplicity
is
the
glory
of
truth
love
of
self
shuts
men
out
from
truth
and
seeking
their
own
personal
happiness
they
lose
the
deeper
purer
and
more
abiding
bliss
says
carlyle
there
is
in
man
a
higher
than
love
of
happiness
he
can
do
without
happiness
and
instead
thereof
find
blessedness
love
not
pleasure
love
god
this
is
the
everlasting
yea
wherein
all
contradiction
is
solved
wherein
whoso
walks
and
works
it
is
well
with
him
he
who
has
yielded
up
that
self
that
personality
that
men
most
love
and
to
which
they
cling
with
such
fierce
tenacity
has
left
behind
him
all
perplexity
and
has
entered
into
a
simplicity
so
profoundly
simple
as
to
be
looked
upon
by
the
world
involved
as
it
is
in
a
network
of
error
as
foolishness
yet
such
a
one
has
realized
the
highest
wisdom
and
is
at
rest
in
the
infinite
he
accomplishes
without
striving
and
all
problems
melt
before
him
for
he
has
entered
the
region
of
reality
and
deals
not
with
changing
effects
but
with
the
unchanging
principles
of
things
he
is
enlightened
with
a
wisdom
which
is
as
superior
to
ratiocination
as
reason
is
to
animality
having
yielded
up
his
lusts
his
errors
his
opinions
and
prejudices
he
has
entered
into
possession
of
the
knowledge
of
god
having
slain
the
selfish
desire
for
heaven
and
along
with
it
the
ignorant
fear
of
hell
having
relinquished
even
the
love
of
life
itself
he
has
gained
supreme
bliss
and
life
eternal
the
life
which
bridges
life
and
death
and
knows
its
own
immortality
having
yielded
up
all
without
reservation
he
has
gained
all
and
rests
in
peace
on
the
bosom
of
the
infinite
only
he
who
has
become
so
free
from
self
as
to
be
equally
content
to
be
annihilated
as
to
live
or
to
live
as
to
be
annihilated
is
fit
to
enter
into
the
infinite
only
he
who
ceasing
to
trust
his
perishable
self
has
learned
to
trust
in
boundless
measure
the
great
law
the
supreme
good
is
prepared
to
partake
of
undying
bliss
for
such
a
one
there
is
no
more
regret
nor
disappointment
nor
remorse
for
where
all
selfishness
has
ceased
these
sufferings
can
not
be
and
whatever
happens
to
him
he
knows
that
it
is
for
his
own
good
and
he
is
content
being
no
longer
the
servant
of
self
but
the
servant
of
the
supreme
he
is
no
longer
affected
by
the
changes
of
earth
and
when
he
hears
of
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
his
peace
is
not
disturbed
and
where
men
grow
angry
and
cynical
and
quarrelsome
he
bestows
compassion
and
love
though
appearances
may
contradict
it
he
knows
that
the
world
is
progressing
and
that
through
its
laughing
and
its
weeping
through
its
living
and
its
keeping
through
its
follies
and
its
labors
weaving
in
and
out
of
sight
to
the
end
from
the
beginning
through
all
virtue
and
all
sinning
reeled
from
god
great
spool
of
progress
runs
the
golden
thread
of
light
when
a
fierce
storm
is
raging
none
are
angered
about
it
because
they
know
it
will
quickly
pass
away
and
when
the
storms
of
contention
are
devastating
the
world
the
wise
man
looking
with
the
eye
of
truth
and
pity
knows
that
it
will
pass
away
and
that
out
of
the
wreckage
of
broken
hearts
which
it
leaves
behind
the
immortal
temple
of
wisdom
will
be
built
sublimely
patient
infinitely
compassionate
deep
silent
and
pure
his
very
presence
is
a
benediction
and
when
he
speaks
men
ponder
his
words
in
their
hearts
and
by
them
rise
to
higher
levels
of
attainment
such
is
he
who
has
entered
into
the
infinite
who
by
the
power
of
utmost
sacrifice
has
solved
the
sacred
mystery
of
life
questioning
life
and
destiny
and
truth
i
sought
the
dark
and
labyrinthine
sphinx
who
spake
to
me
this
strange
and
wondrous
thing
concealment
only
lies
in
blinded
eyes
and
god
alone
can
see
the
form
of
god
i
sought
to
solve
this
hidden
mystery
vainly
by
paths
of
blindness
and
of
pain
but
when
i
found
the
way
of
love
and
peace
concealment
ceased
and
i
was
blind
no
more
then
saw
i
god
with
the
eyes
of
god
saints
sages
and
saviors
the
law
of
service
the
spirit
of
love
which
is
manifested
as
a
perfect
and
rounded
life
is
the
crown
of
being
and
the
supreme
end
of
knowledge
upon
this
earth
the
measure
of
a
man
truth
is
the
measure
of
his
love
and
truth
is
far
removed
from
him
whose
life
is
not
governed
by
love
the
intolerant
and
condemnatory
even
though
they
profess
the
highest
religion
have
the
smallest
measure
of
truth
while
those
who
exercise
patience
and
who
listen
calmly
and
dispassionately
to
all
sides
and
both
arrive
themselves
at
and
incline
others
to
thoughtful
and
unbiased
conclusions
upon
all
problems
and
issues
have
truth
in
fullest
measure
the
final
test
of
wisdom
is
this
how
does
a
man
live
what
spirit
does
he
manifest
how
does
he
act
under
trial
and
temptation
many
men
boast
of
being
in
possession
of
truth
who
are
continually
swayed
by
grief
disappointment
and
passion
and
who
sink
under
the
first
little
trial
that
comes
along
truth
is
nothing
if
not
unchangeable
and
in
so
far
as
a
man
takes
his
stand
upon
truth
does
he
become
steadfast
in
virtue
does
he
rise
superior
to
his
passions
and
emotions
and
changeable
personality
men
formulate
perishable
dogmas
and
call
them
truth
truth
can
not
be
formulated
it
is
ineffable
and
ever
beyond
the
reach
of
intellect
it
can
only
be
experienced
by
practice
it
can
only
be
manifested
as
a
stainless
heart
and
a
perfect
life
who
then
in
the
midst
of
the
ceaseless
pandemonium
of
schools
and
creeds
and
parties
has
the
truth
he
who
lives
it
he
who
practices
it
he
who
having
risen
above
that
pandemonium
by
overcoming
himself
no
longer
engages
in
it
but
sits
apart
quiet
subdued
calm
and
freed
from
all
strife
all
bias
all
condemnation
and
bestows
upon
all
the
glad
and
unselfish
love
of
the
divinity
within
him
he
who
is
patient
calm
gentle
and
forgiving
under
all
circumstances
manifests
the
truth
truth
will
never
be
proved
by
wordy
arguments
and
learned
treatises
for
if
men
do
not
perceive
the
truth
in
infinite
patience
undying
forgiveness
and
compassion
no
words
can
ever
prove
it
to
them
it
is
an
easy
matter
for
the
passionate
to
be
calm
and
patient
when
they
are
alone
or
are
in
the
midst
of
calmness
it
is
equally
easy
for
the
uncharitable
to
be
gentle
and
kind
when
they
are
dealt
kindly
with
but
he
who
retains
his
patience
and
calmness
under
all
trial
who
remains
sublimely
meek
and
gentle
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
he
and
he
alone
is
possessed
of
the
spotless
truth
and
this
is
so
because
such
lofty
virtues
belong
to
the
divine
and
can
only
be
manifested
by
one
who
has
attained
to
the
highest
wisdom
who
has
relinquished
his
passionate
and
nature
who
has
realized
the
supreme
and
unchangeable
law
and
has
brought
himself
into
harmony
with
it
let
men
therefore
cease
from
vain
and
passionate
arguments
about
truth
and
let
them
think
and
say
and
do
those
things
which
make
for
harmony
peace
love
and
let
them
practice
and
search
humbly
and
diligently
for
the
truth
which
frees
the
soul
from
all
error
and
sin
from
all
that
blights
the
human
heart
and
that
darkens
as
with
unending
night
the
pathway
of
the
wandering
souls
of
earth
there
is
one
great
law
which
is
the
foundation
and
cause
of
the
universe
the
law
of
love
it
has
been
called
by
many
names
in
various
countries
and
at
various
times
but
behind
all
its
names
the
same
unalterable
law
may
be
discovered
by
the
eye
of
truth
names
religions
personalities
pass
away
but
the
law
of
love
remains
to
become
possessed
of
a
knowledge
of
this
law
to
enter
into
conscious
harmony
with
it
is
to
become
immortal
invincible
indestructible
it
is
because
of
the
effort
of
the
soul
to
realize
this
law
that
men
come
again
and
again
to
live
to
suffer
and
to
die
and
when
realized
suffering
ceases
personality
is
dispersed
and
the
fleshly
life
and
death
are
destroyed
for
consciousness
becomes
one
with
the
eternal
the
law
is
absolutely
impersonal
and
its
highest
manifested
expression
is
that
of
service
when
the
purified
heart
has
realized
truth
it
is
then
called
upon
to
make
the
last
the
greatest
and
holiest
sacrifice
the
sacrifice
of
the
enjoyment
of
truth
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
sacrifice
that
the
soul
comes
to
dwell
among
men
clothed
with
a
body
of
flesh
content
to
dwell
among
the
lowliest
and
least
and
to
be
esteemed
the
servant
of
all
mankind
that
sublime
humility
which
is
manifested
by
the
world
saviors
is
the
seal
of
godhead
and
he
who
has
annihilated
the
personality
and
has
become
a
living
visible
manifestation
of
the
impersonal
eternal
boundless
spirit
of
love
is
alone
singled
out
as
worthy
to
receive
the
unstinted
worship
of
posterity
he
only
who
succeeds
in
humbling
himself
with
that
divine
humility
which
is
not
only
the
extinction
of
self
but
is
also
the
pouring
out
upon
all
the
spirit
of
unselfish
love
is
exalted
above
measure
and
given
spiritual
dominion
in
the
hearts
of
mankind
all
the
great
spiritual
teachers
have
denied
themselves
personal
luxuries
comforts
and
rewards
have
abjured
temporal
power
and
have
lived
and
taught
the
limitless
and
impersonal
truth
compare
their
lives
and
teachings
and
you
will
find
the
same
simplicity
the
same
the
same
humility
love
and
peace
both
lived
and
preached
by
them
they
taught
the
same
eternal
principles
the
realization
of
which
destroys
all
evil
those
who
have
been
hailed
and
worshiped
as
the
saviors
of
mankind
are
manifestations
of
the
great
impersonal
law
and
being
such
were
free
from
passion
and
prejudice
and
having
no
opinions
and
no
special
letter
of
doctrine
to
preach
and
defend
they
never
sought
to
convert
and
to
proselytize
living
in
the
highest
goodness
the
supreme
perfection
their
sole
object
was
to
uplift
mankind
by
manifesting
that
goodness
in
thought
word
and
deed
they
stand
between
man
the
personal
and
god
the
impersonal
and
serve
as
exemplary
types
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
men
who
are
immersed
in
self
and
who
can
not
comprehend
the
goodness
that
is
absolutely
impersonal
deny
divinity
to
all
saviors
except
their
own
and
thus
introduce
personal
hatred
and
doctrinal
controversy
and
while
defending
their
own
particular
views
with
passion
look
upon
each
other
as
being
heathens
or
infidels
and
so
render
null
and
void
as
far
as
their
lives
are
concerned
the
unselfish
beauty
and
holy
grandeur
of
the
lives
and
teachings
of
their
own
masters
truth
can
not
be
limited
it
can
never
be
the
special
prerogative
of
any
man
school
or
nation
and
when
personality
steps
in
truth
is
lost
the
glory
alike
of
the
saint
the
sage
and
the
savior
is
this
that
he
has
realized
the
most
profound
lowliness
the
most
sublime
unselfishness
having
given
up
all
even
his
own
personality
all
his
works
are
holy
and
enduring
for
they
are
freed
from
every
taint
of
self
he
gives
yet
never
thinks
of
receiving
he
works
without
regretting
the
past
or
anticipating
the
future
and
never
looks
for
reward
when
the
farmer
has
tilled
and
dressed
his
land
and
put
in
the
seed
he
knows
that
he
has
done
all
that
he
can
possibly
do
and
that
now
he
must
trust
to
the
elements
and
wait
patiently
for
the
course
of
time
to
bring
about
the
harvest
and
that
no
amount
of
expectancy
on
his
part
will
affect
the
result
even
so
he
who
has
realized
truth
goes
forth
as
a
sower
of
the
seeds
of
goodness
purity
love
and
peace
without
expectancy
and
never
looking
for
results
knowing
that
there
is
the
great
law
which
brings
about
its
own
harvest
in
due
time
and
which
is
alike
the
source
of
preservation
and
destruction
men
not
understanding
the
divine
simplicity
of
a
profoundly
unselfish
heart
look
upon
their
particular
savior
as
the
manifestation
of
a
special
miracle
as
being
something
entirely
apart
and
distinct
from
the
nature
of
things
and
as
being
in
his
ethical
excellence
eternally
unapproachable
by
the
whole
of
mankind
this
attitude
of
unbelief
for
such
it
is
in
the
divine
perfectibility
of
man
paralyzes
effort
and
binds
the
souls
of
men
as
with
strong
ropes
to
sin
and
suffering
jesus
grew
in
wisdom
and
was
perfected
by
suffering
what
jesus
was
he
became
such
what
buddha
was
he
became
such
and
every
holy
man
became
such
by
unremitting
perseverance
in
once
recognize
this
once
realize
that
by
watchful
effort
and
hopeful
perseverance
you
can
rise
above
your
lower
nature
and
great
and
glorious
will
be
the
vistas
of
attainment
that
will
open
out
before
you
buddha
vowed
that
he
would
not
relax
his
efforts
until
he
arrived
at
the
state
of
perfection
and
he
accomplished
his
purpose
what
the
saints
sages
and
saviors
have
accomplished
you
likewise
may
accomplish
if
you
will
only
tread
the
way
which
they
trod
and
pointed
out
the
way
of
of
service
truth
is
very
simple
it
says
give
up
self
come
unto
me
away
from
all
that
defiles
and
i
will
give
you
rest
all
the
mountains
of
commentary
that
have
been
piled
upon
it
can
not
hide
it
from
the
heart
that
is
earnestly
seeking
for
righteousness
it
does
not
require
learning
it
can
be
known
in
spite
of
learning
disguised
under
many
forms
by
erring
man
the
beautiful
simplicity
and
clear
transparency
of
truth
remains
unaltered
and
undimmed
and
the
unselfish
heart
enters
into
and
partakes
of
its
shining
radiance
not
by
weaving
complex
theories
not
by
building
up
speculative
philosophies
is
truth
realized
but
by
weaving
the
web
of
inward
purity
by
building
up
the
temple
of
a
stainless
life
is
truth
realized
he
who
enters
upon
this
holy
way
begins
by
restraining
his
passions
this
is
virtue
and
is
the
beginning
of
saintship
and
saintship
is
the
beginning
of
holiness
the
entirely
worldly
man
gratifies
all
his
desires
and
practices
no
more
restraint
than
the
law
of
the
land
in
which
he
lives
demands
the
virtuous
man
restrains
his
passions
the
saint
attacks
the
enemy
of
truth
in
its
stronghold
within
his
own
heart
and
restrains
all
selfish
and
impure
thoughts
while
the
holy
man
is
he
who
is
free
from
passion
and
all
impure
thought
and
to
whom
goodness
and
purity
have
become
as
natural
as
scent
and
color
are
to
the
flower
the
holy
man
is
divinely
wise
he
alone
knows
truth
in
its
fullness
and
has
entered
into
abiding
rest
and
peace
for
him
evil
has
ceased
it
has
disappeared
in
the
universal
light
of
the
holiness
is
the
badge
of
wisdom
said
krishna
to
the
prince
arjuna
humbleness
truthfulness
and
harmlessness
patience
and
honor
reverence
for
the
wise
purity
constancy
control
of
self
contempt
of
perception
of
the
certitude
of
ill
in
birth
death
age

and

an
ever
tranquil
heart
in
fortunes
good
and
fortunes

endeavors
resolute
to
reach
perception
of
the
utmost
soul
and
grace
to
understand
what
gain
it
were
so
to
attain
this
is
true
wisdom
prince
and
what
is
otherwise
is
ignorance
whoever
fights
ceaselessly
against
his
own
selfishness
and
strives
to
supplant
it
with
love
is
a
saint
whether
he
live
in
a
cottage
or
in
the
midst
of
riches
and
influence
or
whether
he
preaches
or
remains
obscure
to
the
worldling
who
is
beginning
to
aspire
towards
higher
things
the
saint
such
as
a
sweet
francis
of
assisi
or
a
conquering
anthony
is
a
glorious
and
inspiring
spectacle
to
the
saint
an
equally
enrapturing
sight
is
that
of
the
sage
sitting
serene
and
holy
the
conqueror
of
sin
and
sorrow
no
more
tormented
by
regret
and
remorse
and
whom
even
temptation
can
never
reach
and
yet
even
the
sage
is
drawn
on
by
a
still
more
glorious
vision
that
of
the
savior
actively
manifesting
his
knowledge
in
selfless
works
and
rendering
his
divinity
more
potent
for
good
by
sinking
himself
in
the
throbbing
sorrowing
aspiring
heart
of
mankind
and
this
only
is
true
service
to
forget
oneself
in
love
towards
all
to
lose
oneself
in
working
for
the
whole
o
thou
vain
and
foolish
man
who
thinkest
that
thy
many
works
can
save
thee
who
chained
to
all
error
talkest
loudly
of
thyself
thy
work
and
thy
many
sacrifices
and
magnifiest
thine
own
importance
know
this
that
though
thy
fame
fill
the
whole
earth
all
thy
work
shall
come
to
dust
and
thou
thyself
be
reckoned
lower
than
the
least
in
the
kingdom
of
truth
only
the
work
that
is
impersonal
can
live
the
works
of
self
are
both
powerless
and
perishable
where
duties
howsoever
humble
are
done
without
and
with
joyful
sacrifice
there
is
true
service
and
enduring
work
where
deeds
however
brilliant
and
apparently
successful
are
done
from
love
of
self
there
is
ignorance
of
the
law
of
service
and
the
work
perishes
it
is
given
to
the
world
to
learn
one
great
and
divine
lesson
the
lesson
of
absolute
unselfishness
the
saints
sages
and
saviors
of
all
time
are
they
who
have
submitted
themselves
to
this
task
and
have
learned
and
lived
it
all
the
scriptures
of
the
world
are
framed
to
teach
this
one
lesson
all
the
great
teachers
reiterate
it
it
is
too
simple
for
the
world
which
scorning
it
stumbles
along
in
the
complex
ways
of
selfishness
a
pure
heart
is
the
end
of
all
religion
and
the
beginning
of
divinity
to
search
for
this
righteousness
is
to
walk
the
way
of
truth
and
peace
and
he
who
enters
this
way
will
soon
perceive
that
immortality
which
is
independent
of
birth
and
death
and
will
realize
that
in
the
divine
economy
of
the
universe
the
humblest
effort
is
not
lost
the
divinity
of
a
krishna
a
gautama
or
a
jesus
is
the
crowning
glory
of
the
end
of
the
soul
pilgrimage
in
matter
and
mortality
and
the
world
will
not
have
finished
its
long
journey
until
every
soul
has
become
as
these
and
has
entered
into
the
blissful
realization
of
its
own
divinity
great
glory
crowns
the
heights
of
hope
by
arduous
struggle
won
bright
honor
rounds
the
hoary
head
that
mighty
works
hath
done
fair
riches
come
to
him
who
strives
in
ways
of
golden
gain
and
fame
enshrines
his
name
who
works
with
brain
but
greater
glory
waits
for
him
who
in
the
bloodless
strife
self
and
wrong
adopts
in
love
the
sacrificial
life
and
brighter
honor
rounds
the
brow
of
him
who
the
scorns
of
blind
idolaters
of
self
accepts
the
crown
of
thorns
and
fairer
purer
riches
come
to
him
who
greatly
strives
to
walk
in
ways
of
love
and
truth
to
sweeten
human
lives
and
he
who
serveth
well
mankind
exchanges
fleeting
fame
for
light
eternal
joy
and
peace
and
robes
of
heavenly
flame
the
realization
of
perfect
peace
in
the
external
universe
there
is
ceaseless
turmoil
change
and
unrest
at
the
heart
of
all
things
there
is
undisturbed
repose
in
this
deep
silence
dwelleth
the
eternal
man
partakes
of
this
duality
and
both
the
surface
change
and
disquietude
and
the
eternal
abode
of
peace
are
contained
within
him
as
there
are
silent
depths
in
the
ocean
which
the
fiercest
storm
can
not
reach
so
there
are
silent
holy
depths
in
the
heart
of
man
which
the
storms
of
sin
and
sorrow
can
never
disturb
to
reach
this
silence
and
to
live
consciously
in
it
is
peace
discord
is
rife
in
the
outward
world
but
unbroken
harmony
holds
sway
at
the
heart
of
the
universe
the
human
soul
torn
by
discordant
passion
and
grief
reaches
blindly
toward
the
harmony
of
the
sinless
state
and
to
reach
this
state
and
to
live
consciously
in
it
is
peace
hatred
severs
human
lives
fosters
persecution
and
hurls
nations
into
ruthless
war
yet
men
though
they
do
not
understand
why
retain
some
measure
of
faith
in
the
overshadowing
of
a
perfect
love
and
to
reach
this
love
and
to
live
consciously
in
it
is
peace
and
this
inward
peace
this
silence
this
harmony
this
love
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
which
is
so
difficult
to
reach
because
few
are
willing
to
give
up
themselves
and
to
become
as
little
children
heaven
gate
is
very
narrow
and
minute
it
can
not
be
perceived
by
foolish
men
blinded
by
vain
illusions
of
the
world
the
who
discern
the
way
and
seek
to
enter
find
the
portal
barred
and
hard
to
be
unlocked
its
massive
bolts
are
pride
and
passion
avarice
and
lust
men
cry
peace
peace
where
there
is
no
peace
but
on
the
contrary
discord
disquietude
and
strife
apart
from
that
wisdom
which
is
inseparable
from
there
can
be
no
real
and
abiding
peace
the
peace
which
results
from
social
comfort
passing
gratification
or
worldly
victory
is
transitory
in
its
nature
and
is
burnt
up
in
the
heat
of
fiery
trial
only
the
peace
of
heaven
endures
through
all
trial
and
only
the
selfless
heart
can
know
the
peace
of
heaven
holiness
alone
is
undying
peace
leads
to
it
and
the
light
of
wisdom
guides
the
pilgrim
on
his
way
it
is
partaken
of
in
a
measure
as
soon
as
the
path
of
virtue
is
entered
upon
but
it
is
only
realized
in
its
fullness
when
self
disappears
in
the
consummation
of
a
stainless
life
this
is
peace
to
conquer
love
of
self
and
lust
of
life
to
tear
passion
from
the
heart
to
still
the
inward
strife
if
o
reader
you
would
realize
the
light
that
never
fades
the
joy
that
never
ends
and
the
tranquillity
that
can
not
be
disturbed
if
you
would
leave
behind
for
ever
your
sins
your
sorrows
your
anxieties
and
perplexities
if
i
say
you
would
partake
of
this
salvation
this
supremely
glorious
life
then
conquer
yourself
bring
every
thought
every
impulse
every
desire
into
perfect
obedience
to
the
divine
power
resident
within
you
there
is
no
other
way
to
peace
but
this
and
if
you
refuse
to
walk
it
your
much
praying
and
your
strict
adherence
to
ritual
will
be
fruitless
and
unavailing
and
neither
gods
nor
angels
can
help
you
only
to
him
that
overcometh
is
given
the
white
stone
of
the
regenerate
life
on
which
is
written
the
new
and
ineffable
name
come
away
for
awhile
from
external
things
from
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
from
the
arguments
of
the
intellect
from
the
noise
and
the
excitements
of
the
world
and
withdraw
yourself
into
the
inmost
chamber
of
your
heart
and
there
free
from
the
sacrilegious
intrusion
of
all
selfish
desires
you
will
find
a
deep
silence
a
holy
calm
a
blissful
repose
and
if
you
will
rest
awhile
in
that
holy
place
and
will
meditate
there
the
faultless
eye
of
truth
will
open
within
you
and
you
will
see
things
as
they
really
are
this
holy
place
within
you
is
your
real
and
eternal
self
it
is
the
divine
within
you
and
only
when
you
identify
yourself
with
it
can
you
be
said
to
be
clothed
and
in
your
right
mind
it
is
the
abode
of
peace
the
temple
of
wisdom
the
of
immortality
apart
from
this
inward
this
mount
of
vision
there
can
be
no
true
peace
no
knowledge
of
the
divine
and
if
you
can
remain
there
for
one
minute
one
hour
or
one
day
it
is
possible
for
you
to
remain
there
always
all
your
sins
and
sorrows
your
fears
and
anxieties
are
your
own
and
you
can
cling
to
them
or
you
can
give
them
up
of
your
own
accord
you
cling
to
your
unrest
of
your
own
accord
you
can
come
to
abiding
peace
no
one
else
can
give
up
sin
for
you
you
must
give
it
up
yourself
the
greatest
teacher
can
do
no
more
than
walk
the
way
of
truth
for
himself
and
point
it
out
to
you
you
yourself
must
walk
it
for
yourself
you
can
obtain
freedom
and
peace
alone
by
your
own
efforts
by
yielding
up
that
which
binds
the
soul
and
which
is
destructive
of
peace
the
angels
of
divine
peace
and
joy
are
always
at
hand
and
if
you
do
not
see
them
and
hear
them
and
dwell
with
them
it
is
because
you
shut
yourself
out
from
them
and
prefer
the
company
of
the
spirits
of
evil
within
you
you
are
what
you
will
to
be
what
you
wish
to
be
what
you
prefer
to
be
you
can
commence
to
purify
yourself
and
by
so
doing
can
arrive
at
peace
or
you
can
refuse
to
purify
yourself
and
so
remain
with
suffering
step
aside
then
come
out
of
the
fret
and
the
fever
of
life
away
from
the
scorching
heat
of
self
and
enter
the
inward
where
the
cooling
airs
of
peace
will
calm
renew
and
restore
you
come
out
of
the
storms
of
sin
and
anguish
why
be
troubled
and
when
the
haven
of
peace
of
god
is
yours
give
up
all
give
up
self
and
lo
the
peace
of
god
is
yours
subdue
the
animal
within
you
conquer
every
selfish
uprising
every
discordant
voice
transmute
the
base
metals
of
your
selfish
nature
into
the
unalloyed
gold
of
love
and
you
shall
realize
the
life
of
perfect
peace
thus
subduing
thus
conquering
thus
transmuting
you
will
o
reader
while
living
in
the
flesh
cross
the
dark
waters
of
mortality
and
will
reach
that
shore
upon
which
the
storms
of
sorrow
never
beat
and
where
sin
and
suffering
and
dark
uncertainty
can
not
come
standing
upon
that
shore
holy
compassionate
awakened
and
and
glad
with
unending
gladness
you
will
realize
that
never
the
spirit
was
born
the
spirit
will
cease
to
be
never
never
was
time
it
was
not
end
and
beginning
are
dreams
birthless
and
deathless
and
changeless
remaineth
the
spirit
for
ever
death
hath
not
touched
it
at
all
dead
though
the
house
of
it
seems
you
will
then
know
the
meaning
of
sin
of
sorrow
of
suffering
and
that
the
end
thereof
is
wisdom
will
know
the
cause
and
the
issue
of
existence
and
with
this
realization
you
will
enter
into
rest
for
this
is
the
bliss
of
immortality
this
the
unchangeable
gladness
this
the
untrammeled
knowledge
undefiled
wisdom
and
undying
love
this
and
this
only
is
the
realization
of
perfect
peace
o
thou
who
wouldst
teach
men
of
truth
hast
thou
passed
through
the
desert
of
doubt
art
thou
purged
by
the
fires
of
sorrow
hath
ruth
the
fiends
of
opinion
cast
out
of
thy
human
heart
is
thy
soul
so
fair
that
no
false
thought
can
ever
harbor
there
o
thou
who
wouldst
teach
men
of
love
hast
thou
passed
through
the
place
of
despair
hast
thou
wept
through
the
dark
night
of
grief
does
it
move
now
freed
from
its
sorrow
and
care
thy
human
heart
to
pitying
gentleness
looking
on
wrong
and
hate
and
ceaseless
stress
o
thou
who
wouldst
teach
men
of
peace
hast
thou
crossed
the
wide
ocean
of
strife
hast
thou
found
on
the
shores
of
the
silence
release
from
all
the
wild
unrest
of
life
from
thy
human
heart
hath
all
striving
gone
leaving
but
truth
and
love
and
peace
alone
