december
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
changing
the
world
is
simple
the
trick
is
to
do
it
before
you
have
a
chance
to
undo
it
it
was
a
good
job
and
max
alben
knew
whom
he
had
to
thank
for
it
his
good
old
giovanni
albeni
he
muttered
as
he
hurried
into
the
laboratory
slightly
ahead
of
the
escorting
technicians
all
of
them
despite
the
excitement
of
the
moment
remembering
to
bob
their
heads
deferentially
at
the
and
men
lolling
on
the
couches
that
had
been
set
up
around
the
time
machine
he
shrugged
rapidly
out
of
his
rags
as
he
had
been
instructed
in
the
anteroom
and
stepped
into
the
housing
of
the
enormous
mechanism
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
it
since
he
had
been
taught
how
to
operate
it
on
a
dummy
model
and
now
he
stared
at
the
great
transparent
coils
and
the
susurrating
energy
bubble
with
much
respect
this
machine
the
pride
and
the
hope
of
was
something
almost
outside
his
powers
of
comprehension
but
max
alben
knew
how
to
run
it
and
he
knew
roughly
what
it
was
supposed
to
accomplish
he
knew
also
that
this
was
the
first
backward
journey
of
any
great
duration
and
being
scientifically
unpredictable
might
well
be
the
death
of
him
good
old
giovanni
albeni
he
muttered
again
affectionately
if
his
had
not
volunteered
for
the
earliest
experiments
way
back
in
the
back
even
before
the
blight
it
would
never
have
been
discovered
that
he
and
his
seed
possessed
a
great
deal
of
immunity
to
blackout
and
if
that
had
not
been
discovered
the
ruling
powers
of
earth
more
than
a
century
later
would
never
have
plucked
max
alben
out
of
an
obscure
job
as
a
relief
guard
at
the
north
american
chicken
reservation
to
his
present
heroic
and
remunerative
eminence
he
would
still
be
patrolling
the
barbed
wire
that
surrounded
the
three
white
leghorn
hens
and
two
roosters
about
of
the
known
livestock
wealth
of
the
western
hemisphere
thoroughly
content
with
the
of
dried
apricots
he
received
each
and
every
payday
no
if
his
had
not
demonstrated
long
ago
his
unique
capacity
for
remaining
conscious
during
time
travel
max
alben
would
not
now
be
shifting
from
foot
to
foot
in
a
physics
laboratory
facing
the
black
market
kings
of
the
world
and
awaiting
their
final
instructions
with
an
uncertain
and
submissive
grin
men
like
who
controlled
mushrooms
levney
the
blackberry
tycoon
sorgasso
the
monopolist
would
black
marketeers
of
their
tremendous
stature
so
much
as
waste
a
glance
on
someone
like
alben
ordinarily
let
alone
confer
a
lifetime
pension
on
his
wife
and
five
children
of
a
full
spoonful
each
of
sugar
a
day
even
if
he
did
come
back
his
family
was
provided
for
like
almost
no
other
family
on
earth
this
was
a
damn
good
job
and
he
was
lucky
alben
noticed
that
abd
sadha
had
risen
from
the
straight
chair
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
and
was
approaching
him
with
a
sealed
metal
cylinder
in
one
hand
we
decided
to
add
a
further
precaution
at
the
last
moment
the
old
man
said
that
is
the
scientists
have
suggested
it
and
i
have
er
i
have
given
my
approval
the
last
remark
was
added
with
a
slight
questioning
note
as
the
of
the
united
nations
looked
back
rapidly
at
the
black
market
princes
on
the
couches
behind
him
since
they
stared
back
stonily
but
offered
no
objection
he
coughed
in
relief
and
returned
to
alben
i
am
sure
young
man
that
i
do
have
to
go
into
the
details
of
your
instructions
once
more
you
enter
the
time
machine
and
go
back
the
duration
for
which
it
has
been
preset
a
hundred
and
thirteen
years
to
the
moment
after
the
guided
missile
of
was
launched
it
is
it
he
asked
suddenly
uncertain
yes
sir
one
of
the
technicians
standing
by
the
time
machine
said
respectfully
the
experiment
with
an
atomic
warhead
guided
missile
that
resulted
in
the
blight
was
conducted
on
this
site
on
april
he
glanced
proudly
at
the
unemotional
men
on
the
couches
very
much
like
a
small
boy
after
completing
a
recitation
before
visiting
dignitaries
from
the
board
of
education
just
so
abd
sadha
nodded
april
and
on
this
site
you
see
young
man
you
will
materialize
at
the
very
moment
and
on
the
very
spot
where
the
station
handling
the
missile
was
er
handling
the
missile
you
will
be
in
a
superb
position
a
superb
position
to
deflect
the
missile
in
its
downward
course
and
alter
human
history
for
the
better
very
much
for
the
better
yes
he
paused
having
evidently
stumbled
out
of
his
thought
sequence
and
he
pulls
the
red
switch
toward
him
gomez
the
magnate
reminded
him
sharply
impatiently
ah
yes
the
red
switch
he
pulls
the
little
red
switch
toward
him
thank
you
gomez
thank
you
very
much
sir
he
pulls
the
little
red
switch
on
the
green
instrument
panel
toward
him
thus
preventing
the
error
that
caused
the
missile
to
explode
in
the
brazilian
jungle
and
causing
it
instead
to
explode
somewhere
in
the
as
originally
planned
the
of
the
united
nations
beamed
thus
preventing
the
blight
making
it
nonexistent
as
it
were
producing
a
world
in
which
the
blight
never
occurred
that
is
correct
is
it
not
gentlemen
he
asked
turning
anxiously
again
none
of
the
men
on
couches
deigned
to
answer
him
and
alben
kept
his
eyes
deferentially
in
their
direction
too
as
he
had
throughout
this
period
of
instruction
he
knew
who
ruled
his
world
these
stolid
men
in
clean
garments
with
a
minimum
of
patches
and
where
patches
occurred
at
least
they
were
the
color
of
the
surrounding
cloth
sadha
might
be
of
the
united
nations
but
that
was
still
a
job
only
a
few
social
notches
higher
than
a
chicken
guard
his
clothes
were
fully
as
ragged
fully
as
as
those
that
alben
had
stepped
out
of
and
the
gnawing
in
his
stomach
was
no
doubt
almost
as
great
you
understand
do
you
not
young
man
that
if
anything
goes
wrong
abd
sadha
asked
his
head
nodding
tremulously
and
anticipating
the
answer
if
anything
unexpected
occurs
you
are
not
to
continue
with
the
experiment
but
return
immediately
he
understands
everything
he
has
to
understand
gomez
told
him
let
get
this
thing
moving
the
old
man
smiled
again
yes
of
course
mr
gomez
he
came
up
to
where
alben
stood
in
the
entrance
of
the
time
machine
and
handed
the
sealed
metal
cylinder
to
him
this
is
the
precaution
the
scientists
have
just
added
when
you
arrive
at
your
destination
just
before
materializing
you
will
release
it
into
the
surrounding
temporal
medium
our
purpose
here
as
you
no
doubt
levney
sat
up
on
his
couch
and
snapped
his
fingers
peremptorily
i
just
heard
gomez
tell
you
to
get
this
thing
moving
sadha
and
it
moving
we
busy
men
we
wasted
enough
time
i
was
just
trying
to
explain
a
crucial
final
fact
the
apologized
a
fact
which
may
be
highly
you
explained
enough
facts
levney
turned
to
the
man
inside
the
time
machine
hey
fella
you
max
alben
gulped
and
nodded
violently
he
darted
to
the
rear
of
the
machine
and
turned
the
dial
which
activated
it
it
was
a
good
job
and
mac
albin
knew
whom
he
had
to
thank
for
it
his
good
old
giovanni
albeni
he
laughed
as
he
looked
at
the
morose
faces
of
his
two
colleagues
bob
skeat
and
hugo
honek
had
done
as
much
as
he
to
build
the
tiny
time
machine
in
the
secret
lab
under
the
helicopter
garage
and
they
were
fully
as
eager
to
go
but
unfortunately
for
them
they
were
not
descended
from
the
right
ancestor
leisurely
he
unzipped
the
richly
embroidered
garment
that
as
the
father
of
two
children
he
was
privileged
to
wear
and
wriggled
into
the
housing
of
the
complex
little
mechanism
this
was
hardly
the
first
time
he
had
seen
it
since
he
been
helping
to
build
the
device
from
the
moment
honek
had
nodded
and
risen
from
the
drafting
board
and
now
he
barely
wasted
a
glance
on
the
translucent
coils
growing
out
of
the
almost
microscopic
energy
bubbles
which
powered
them
this
machine
was
the
last
hope
of
even
if
the
world
of
as
a
whole
did
not
know
of
its
existence
and
would
try
to
prevent
its
being
put
into
operation
but
it
meant
a
lot
more
to
mac
albin
than
merely
saving
a
world
it
meant
an
adventurous
mission
with
the
risk
of
death
good
old
giovanni
albeni
he
laughed
again
happily
if
his
had
not
volunteered
for
the
earliest
experiments
way
back
in
the
back
even
before
the
epidemic
it
would
never
have
been
discovered
that
he
and
his
seed
possessed
a
great
deal
of
immunity
to
blackout
and
if
that
had
not
been
discovered
the
albins
would
not
have
become
physicists
upon
the
passage
of
the
united
nations
law
that
everyone
on
earth
absolutely
without
exception
had
to
choose
a
branch
of
research
science
in
which
to
specialize
in
the
flabby
careful
world
the
earth
had
become
mac
albin
would
never
have
been
reluctantly
selected
by
his
two
as
the
one
to
carry
the
forbidden
banner
of
dangerous
experiment
no
if
his
had
not
demonstrated
long
ago
his
unique
capacity
for
remaining
conscious
during
time
travel
mac
albin
would
probably
be
a
biologist
today
like
almost
everyone
else
on
earth
laboriously
working
out
dreary
gene
problems
instead
of
embarking
on
the
greatest
adventure
man
had
known
to
date
even
if
he
did
come
back
he
had
at
last
found
a
socially
useful
escape
from
genetic
responsibility
to
humanity
in
general
and
his
own
family
in
particular
this
was
a
damn
good
job
and
he
was
lucky
wait
a
minute
mac
skeat
said
and
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
laboratory
albin
and
honek
watched
him
stuff
several
sheets
of
paper
into
a
small
metal
box
which
he
closed
without
locking
you
will
take
care
of
yourself
wo
you
mac
hugo
honek
pleaded
any
time
you
feel
like
taking
an
unnecessary
risk
remember
that
bob
and
i
will
have
to
stand
trial
if
you
do
come
back
we
might
be
sentenced
to
complete
loss
of
professional
status
and
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
supervising
robot
factories
oh
it
wo
be
that
bad
albin
reassured
him
from
where
he
lay
contorted
inside
the
time
machine
he
watched
skeat
coming
toward
him
with
the
box
honek
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
might
be
a
lot
worse
than
even
that
and
you
know
it
the
disappearance
of
a
father
is
going
to
leave
an
awful
big
vacancy
in
the
world
like
bob
and
me
are
all
over
the
place
if
either
of
us
dropped
out
of
sight
it
would
cause
nearly
as
much
uproar
but
bob
and
you
both
tried
to
operate
the
machine
albin
reminded
him
and
you
blacked
out
after
a
temporal
displacement
so
i
the
only
chance
the
only
way
to
stop
the
human
race
from
dwindling
and
dwindling
till
it
hits
absolute
zero
like
that
fat
old
security
council
seems
willing
for
it
to
do
take
it
easy
mac
bob
skeat
said
as
he
handed
the
metal
box
to
albin
the
security
council
is
just
trying
to
solve
the
problem
in
their
way
the
conservative
way
a
worldwide
concentration
on
genetics
research
coupled
with
the
maximum
preservation
of
existing
human
lives
especially
those
that
have
a
high
reproductive
potential
we
three
disagree
with
them
we
been
skulking
down
here
nights
to
solve
it
way
and
ours
is
a
radical
approach
and
plenty
risky
the
reason
for
the
metal
box
trying
to
cover
one
more
explosive
possibility
albin
turned
it
around
curiously
how
i
sat
up
all
last
night
writing
the
manuscript
that
inside
it
look
mac
when
you
go
back
to
the
guided
missile
experiment
of
and
push
that
red
switch
away
from
you
a
lot
of
other
things
are
going
to
happen
than
just
deflecting
the
missile
so
that
it
will
explode
in
the
brazilian
jungle
instead
of
the
pacific
ocean
sure
i
know
if
it
explodes
in
the
jungle
the
epidemic
occur
no
shapiro
mumps
skeat
jiggled
his
pudgy
little
face
impatiently
that
not
what
i
mean
the
epidemic
does
occur
but
something
else
does
a
new
world
a
different
an
alternate
time
sequence
it
be
a
world
in
which
humanity
has
a
better
chance
to
survive
but
it
be
one
with
problems
of
its
own
maybe
tough
problems
maybe
the
problems
will
be
tough
enough
so
that
they
get
the
same
idea
we
did
and
try
to
go
back
to
the
same
point
in
time
to
change
them
albin
laughed
that
just
looking
for
trouble
maybe
it
is
but
that
my
job
hugo
the
designer
of
the
time
machine
and
you
the
operator
but
i
the
theoretical
man
in
this
research
team
it
my
job
to
look
for
trouble
so
just
in
case
i
wrote
a
brief
history
of
the
world
from
the
time
the
missile
exploded
in
the
pacific
it
tells
why
ours
is
the
worst
possible
of
futures
it
in
that
box
what
do
i
do
with
it
hand
it
to
the
guy
from
the
alternate
the
small
fat
man
exasperatedly
hit
the
side
of
the
time
machine
with
a
palm
you
know
better
there
wo
be
any
alternate
until
you
push
that
red
switch
on
the
green
instrument
panel
the
moment
you
do
our
world
with
all
its
slow
slide
to
extinction
goes
out
and
its
alternate
goes
on
just
like
two
electric
light
bulbs
on
a
circuit
we
and
every
single
one
of
our
artifacts
including
the
time
machine
disappear
the
problem
is
how
to
keep
that
manuscript
from
disappearing
well
all
you
do
if
i
have
this
figured
right
is
shove
the
metal
box
containing
the
manuscript
out
into
the
surrounding
temporal
medium
a
moment
before
you
materialize
to
do
your
job
that
temporal
medium
in
which
you
be
traveling
is
something
that
exists
independent
of
and
autonomous
to
all
possible
futures
it
my
hunch
that
something
that
immersed
in
it
will
not
be
altered
by
a
new
time
sequence
remind
him
to
be
careful
bob
honek
rumbled
he
thinks
he
captain
blood
and
this
is
his
big
chance
to
run
away
to
sea
and
become
a
swashbuckling
pirate
albin
grimaced
in
annoyance
i
excited
by
doing
something
besides
sitting
in
a
safe
little
corner
working
out
safe
little
abstractions
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
i
know
that
this
is
a
first
experiment
honestly
hugo
i
really
have
enough
intelligence
to
recognize
that
simple
fact
i
know
that
if
anything
unexpected
pops
up
anything
we
did
foresee
i
supposed
to
come
scuttling
back
and
ask
for
advice
i
hope
you
do
bob
skeat
sighed
i
hope
you
do
know
that
a
twentieth
century
poet
once
wrote
something
to
the
effect
that
the
world
will
end
not
with
a
bang
but
a
whimper
well
our
world
is
ending
with
a
whimper
try
to
see
that
it
does
end
with
a
bang
either
that
i
promise
you
albin
said
a
trifle
disgustedly
it
end
with
neither
a
bang
a
whimper
so
long
hugo
so
long
bob
he
twisted
around
reaching
overhead
for
the
lever
which
activated
the
forces
that
drove
the
time
machine
it
was
strange
max
alben
reflected
that
this
time
travel
business
which
knocked
unconscious
everyone
who
tried
it
only
made
him
feel
slightly
dizzy
that
was
because
he
was
descended
from
giovanni
albeni
he
had
been
told
there
must
be
some
complicated
scientific
explanation
for
it
he
decided
and
that
would
make
it
none
of
his
business
better
forget
about
it
all
around
the
time
machine
there
was
a
heavy
gray
murk
in
which
objects
were
hinted
at
rather
than
stated
definitely
it
reminded
him
of
patrolling
his
beat
at
the
north
american
chicken
reservation
in
a
thick
fog
according
to
his
gauges
he
was
now
in
he
cut
speed
until
he
hit
the
last
day
of
april
then
cut
speed
again
drifting
slowly
backward
to
the
eighteenth
the
day
of
the
infamous
guided
missile
experiment
carefully
carefully
like
a
man
handling
a
strange
bomb
made
on
a
strange
planet
he
watched
the
center
gauge
until
the
needle
came
to
rest
against
the
thin
etched
line
that
indicated
the
exactly
crucial
moment
then
he
pulled
the
brake
and
stopped
the
machine
dead
all
he
had
to
do
now
was
materialize
in
the
right
spot
flash
out
and
pull
the
red
switch
toward
him
then
his
assignment
would
be
done
but
he
stopped
and
scratched
his
hair
was
there
something
he
was
supposed
to
do
a
second
before
materialization
yes
that
useless
old
windbag
sadha
had
given
him
a
last
instruction
he
picked
up
the
sealed
metal
cylinder
walked
to
the
entrance
of
the
time
machine
and
tossed
it
into
the
gray
murk
a
solid
object
floating
near
the
entrance
caught
his
eye
he
put
his
arm
out
whew
it
was
cold
and
pulled
it
inside
a
small
metal
box
funny
what
was
it
doing
out
there
curiously
he
opened
it
hoping
to
find
something
valuable
nothing
but
a
few
sheets
of
paper
alben
noted
disappointedly
he
began
to
read
them
slowly
very
slowly
for
the
manuscript
was
full
of
a
lot
of
long
and
complicated
words
like
a
letter
from
one
bookworm
scientist
to
another
the
problems
all
began
with
the
guided
missile
experiment
of
he
read
there
had
been
a
number
of
such
experiments
but
it
was
the
one
of
that
finally
did
the
damage
the
biologists
had
been
warning
about
the
missile
with
its
deadly
warhead
exploded
in
the
pacific
ocean
as
planned
the
physicists
and
the
military
men
went
home
to
study
their
notes
and
the
world
shivered
once
more
over
the
approaching
war
and
tried
to
forget
about
it
but
there
was
fallout
a
radioactive
rain
several
hundred
miles
to
the
north
and
a
small
fishing
fleet
got
thoroughly
soaked
by
it
fortunately
the
radioactivity
in
the
rain
was
sufficiently
low
to
do
little
obvious
physical
damage
all
it
did
was
cause
a
mutation
in
the
mumps
virus
that
several
of
the
men
in
the
fleet
were
incubating
at
the
time
having
caught
it
from
the
children
of
the
fishing
town
among
whom
a
minor
epidemic
was
raging
the
fleet
returned
to
its
home
town
which
promptly
came
down
with
the
new
kind
of
mumps
llewellyn
shapiro
the
only
physician
in
town
was
the
first
man
to
note
that
while
the
symptoms
of
this
disease
were
substantially
milder
than
those
of
its
unmutated
parent
practically
no
one
was
immune
to
it
and
its
effects
on
human
reproductivity
were
truly
terrible
most
people
were
completely
sterilized
by
it
the
rest
were
rendered
much
less
capable
of
fathering
or
bearing
offspring
shapiro
mumps
spread
over
the
entire
planet
in
the
next
few
decades
it
leaped
across
every
quarantine
erected
for
a
long
time
it
successfully
defied
all
the
vaccines
and
serums
attempted
against
it
then
when
a
vaccine
was
finally
perfected
humanity
discovered
to
its
dismay
that
its
generative
powers
had
been
permanently
and
fundamentally
impaired
something
had
happened
to
the
germ
plasm
a
large
percentage
of
individuals
were
born
sterile
and
of
those
who
were
not
one
child
was
usually
the
most
that
could
be
expected
a
parent
being
quite
rare
and
a
parent
almost
unknown
strict
eugenic
control
was
instituted
by
the
security
council
of
the
united
nations
so
that
fertile
men
and
women
would
not
be
wasted
upon
mates
fertility
was
the
most
important
avenue
to
social
status
and
right
after
it
came
successful
genetic
research
genetic
research
had
the
very
best
minds
prodded
into
it
the
lesser
ones
went
into
the
other
sciences
everyone
on
earth
was
engaged
in
some
form
of
scientific
research
to
some
extent
since
the
population
was
now
so
limited
in
proportion
to
the
great
resources
available
all
physical
labor
had
long
been
done
by
robots
the
government
saw
to
it
that
everybody
had
an
ample
supply
of
goods
and
in
return
asked
only
that
they
experiment
without
any
risk
to
their
own
lives
every
human
being
was
now
a
highly
guarded
rarity
there
were
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
of
them
well
below
the
danger
point
it
had
been
estimated
where
a
species
might
be
wiped
out
by
a
new
calamity
not
that
another
calamity
would
be
needed
since
the
end
of
the
epidemic
the
birth
rate
had
been
moving
further
and
further
behind
the
death
rate
in
another
century
that
was
why
a
desperate
and
secret
attempt
to
alter
the
past
was
being
made
this
kind
of
world
was
evidently
impossible
max
alben
finished
the
manuscript
and
sighed
what
a
wonderful
world
what
a
comfortable
place
to
live
he
walked
to
the
rear
dials
and
began
the
process
of
materializing
at
the
crucial
moment
on
april
it
was
odd
mac
albin
reflected
that
these
temporal
journeys
which
induced
coma
in
everyone
who
tried
it
only
made
him
feel
slightly
dizzy
that
was
because
he
was
descended
from
giovanni
albeni
he
knew
maybe
there
was
some
genetic
relationship
with
his
fertility
might
be
a
good
idea
to
mention
the
idea
to
a
biologist
or
two
when
he
returned
he
returned
all
around
the
time
machine
there
was
a
soupy
gray
murk
in
which
objects
were
hinted
at
rather
than
stated
definitely
it
reminded
him
of
the
problems
of
landing
a
helicopter
in
a
thick
fog
when
the
robot
butler
had
not
been
told
to
turn
on
the
ground
lights
according
to
the
insulated
register
he
was
now
in
he
lowered
speed
until
he
registered
april
then
maneuvered
slowly
backward
through
time
to
the
eighteenth
the
day
of
the
infamous
guided
missile
experiment
carefully
carefully
like
an
obstetrician
supervising
surgical
robots
at
an
unusually
difficult
birth
he
watched
the
register
until
it
rolled
to
rest
against
the
notch
that
indicated
the
exactly
crucial
moment
then
he
pushed
a
button
and
froze
the
machine
where
it
was
all
he
had
to
do
now
was
materialize
in
the
right
spot
flash
out
and
push
the
red
switch
from
him
then
his
exciting
adventure
would
be
over
but
he
paused
and
tapped
at
his
sleek
chin
he
was
supposed
to
do
something
a
second
before
materialization
yes
that
nervous
theoretician
bob
skeat
had
given
him
a
last
suggestion
he
picked
up
the
small
metal
box
twisted
around
to
face
the
opening
of
the
time
machine
and
dropped
it
into
the
gray
murk
a
solid
object
floating
near
the
opening
attracted
his
attention
he
shot
his
arm
out
it
was
as
cold
as
they
had
figured
and
pulled
the
object
inside
a
sealed
metal
cylinder
strange
what
was
it
doing
out
there
anxiously
he
opened
it
not
daring
to
believe
he
find
a
document
inside
yes
that
was
exactly
what
it
was
he
saw
excitedly
he
began
to
read
it
rapidly
very
rapidly
as
if
it
were
a
newly
published
paper
on
neutrinos
besides
the
manuscript
was
written
with
almost
painful
simplicity
like
a
textbook
composed
by
a
stuffy
pedagogue
for
the
use
of
morons
the
problems
all
began
with
the
guided
missile
experiment
of
he
read
there
had
been
a
number
of
such
experiments
but
it
was
the

that
finally
did
the
damage
the
biologists
had
been
warning
about
the
missile
with
its
deadly
warhead
exploded
in
the
brazilian
jungle
through
some
absolutely
unforgivable
error
in
the
station
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
station
was
reprimanded
and
the
men
under
him
and
the
brazilian
government
was
paid
a
handsome
compensation
for
the
damage
but
there
had
been
more
damage
than
anyone
knew
at
the
time
a
plant
virus
similar
to
the
tobacco
mosaic
had
mutated
under
the
impact
of
radioactivity
five
years
later
it
burst
out
of
the
jungle
and
completely
wiped
out
every
last
rice
plant
on
earth
japan
and
a
large
part
of
asia
became
inhabited
by
a
few
struggling
nomads
then
the
virus
adjusted
to
wheat
and
corn
and
famine
howled
in
every
street
of
the
planet
all
attempts
by
botanists
to
control
the
blight
failed
because
of
the
swiftness
of
its
onslaught
and
after
it
had
fed
it
hit
again
at
a
new
plant
and
another
and
another
most
of
the
world
mammals
had
been
slaughtered
for
food
long
before
they
could
starve
to
death
many
insects
too
before
they
became
extinct
at
the
loss
of
their
edible
plants
served
to
assuage
hunger
to
some
small
extent
but
the
nutritive
potential
of
earth
was
steadily
diminishing
in
a
horrifying
geometric
progression
recently
it
had
been
observed
plankton
the
tiny
organism
on
which
most
of
the
sea
ecology
was
based
had
started
to
disappear
and
with
its
diminution
dead
fish
had
begun
to
pile
up
on
the
beaches
mankind
had
lunged
out
desperately
in
all
directions
in
an
effort
to
survive
but
nothing
had
worked
for
any
length
of
time
even
the
other
planets
of
the
solar
system
which
had
been
reached
and
explored
at
a
tremendous
cost
in
remaining
resources
had
yielded
no
edible
vegetation
synthetics
had
failed
to
fill
the
prodigious
gap
in
the
midst
of
the
sharply
increasing
hunger
social
controls
had
pretty
much
dissolved
pathetic
attempts
at
rationing
still
continued
but
black
markets
became
the
only
markets
and
black
marketeers
the
barons
of
life
starvation
took
the
hindmost
and
only
the
most
agile
economically
lived
in
comparative
comfort
law
and
order
were
had
only
by
those
who
could
afford
to
pay
for
them
and
children
of
impoverished
families
were
sold
on
the
open
market
for
a
bit
of
food
but
the
blight
was
still
adjusting
to
new
plants
and
the
food
supply
kept
shrinking
in
another
century
that
was
why
the
planet
powerful
individuals
had
been
persuaded
to
pool
their
wealth
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
alter
the
past
this
kind
of
world
was
manifestly
impossible
mac
albin
finished
the
document
and
sighed
what
a
magnificent
world
what
an
exciting
place
to
live
he
dropped
his
hand
on
the
side
levers
and
began
the
process
of
materializing
at
the
crucial
moment
on
april
as
the
equipment
of
the
station
began
to
take
on
a
blurred
reality
all
around
him
max
alben
felt
a
bit
of
fear
at
what
he
was
doing
the
technicians
he
remembered
the
even
the
black
market
kings
had
all
warned
him
not
to
go
ahead
with
his
instructions
if
anything
unusual
turned
up
that
was
an
awful
lot
of
power
to
disobey
he
knew
he
should
return
with
this
new
information
and
let
better
minds
work
on
it
they
with
their
easy
lives
what
did
they
know
what
existence
had
been
like
for
such
as
he
hunger
always
hunger
scrabbling
servility
and
more
hunger
every
time
things
got
really
tight
you
and
your
wife
looking
sideways
at
your
kids
and
wondering
which
of
them
would
bring
the
best
price
buying
security
for
them
as
he
was
now
at
the
risk
of
his
life
but
in
this
other
world
this
other
there
was
a
state
that
took
care
of
you
and
that
treasured
your
children
a
man
like
himself
with
children
why
he
be
a
big
man
maybe
the
biggest
man
on
earth
and
he
have
robots
to
work
for
him
and
lots
of
food
above
all
lots
and
lots
of
food
he
even
be
a
scientist
was
a
scientist
there
they
and
he
have
a
big
laboratory
all
to
himself
this
other
world
had
its
troubles
but
it
was
a
lot
nicer
place
than
where
he
come
from
he
would
return
he
go
through
with
it
the
fear
left
him
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
max
alben
felt
the
sensation
of
power
he
materialized
the
time
machine
around
the
green
instrument
panel
sweating
a
bit
at
the
sight
of
the
roomful
of
military
figures
despite
the
technicians
reassurances
that
all
this
would
be
happening
too
fast
to
be
visible
he
saw
the
single
red
switch
pointing
upward
on
the
instrument
panel
the
switch
that
controlled
the
course
of
the
missile
now
now
to
make
a
halfway
decent
world
max
alben
pulled
the
little
red
switch
toward
him
as
the
equipment
of
the
station
began
to
oscillate
into
reality
all
around
him
mac
albin
felt
a
bit
of
shame
at
what
he
was
doing
he
promised
bob
and
hugo
to
drop
the
experiment
at
any
stage
if
a
new
factor
showed
up
he
knew
he
should
go
back
with
this
new
information
and
have
all
three
of
them
kick
it
around
but
what
would
they
be
able
to
tell
him
they
with
their
blissful
adjustment
to
their
thoroughly
blueprinted
lives
they
at
least
had
been
ordered
to
marry
women
they
could
live
with
he
drawn
a
female
with
whom
he
was
completely
incompatible
in
any
but
a
genetic
sense
genetics
he
was
tired
of
genetics
and
the
sanctity
of
human
life
tired
to
the
tip
of
his
uncalloused
fingers
tired
to
the
recesses
of
his
unused
muscles
he
was
tired
of
having
to
undertake
a
simple
adventure
like
a
thief
in
the
night
but
in
this
other
world
this
other
someone
like
himself
would
be
a
monarch
of
the
black
market
a
suzerain
of
chaos
making
his
own
rules
taking
his
own
women
so
what
if
the
weaklings
those
unfit
to
carry
on
the
race
went
to
the
wall
his
kind
would
he
formed
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
kind
of
men
who
ruled
that
other
world
from
the
document
in
the
sealed
metal
cylinder
the
black
marketeers
had
not
even
read
it
why
the
fools
had
obviously
been
duped
by
the
technicians
into
permitting
the
experiment
they
had
not
grasped
the
idea
that
an
alternate
time
track
would
mean
their
own
this
other
world
had
its
troubles
but
it
was
certainly
a
livelier
place
than
where
he
come
from
it
deserved
a
chance
yes
that
was
how
he
felt
his
world
was
drowsily
moribund
this
alternate
was
starving
but
managing
to
flail
away
at
destiny
it
a
chance
albin
decided
that
he
was
experiencing
renunciation
and
felt
proud
he
materialized
the
time
machine
around
the
green
instrument
panel
disregarding
the
roomful
of
military

since
he
knew
they
could
not
see

the
