the
runaway
skyscraper
murray
leinster
complete
in
this
issue
i
the
whole
thing
started
when
the
clock
on
the
metropolitan
tower
began
to
run
backward
it
was
not
a
graceful
proceeding
the
hands
had
been
moving
onward
in
their
customary
deliberate
fashion
slowly
and
thoughtfully
but
suddenly
the
people
in
the
offices
near
the
clock
face
heard
an
ominous
creaking
and
groaning
there
was
a
slight
hardly
discernible
shiver
through
the
tower
and
then
something
gave
with
a
crash
the
big
hands
on
the
clock
began
to
move
backward
immediately
after
the
crash
all
the
creaking
and
groaning
ceased
and
instead
the
usual
quiet
again
hung
over
everything
one
or
two
of
the
occupants
of
the
upper
offices
put
their
heads
out
into
the
halls
but
the
elevators
were
running
as
usual
the
lights
were
burning
and
all
seemed
calm
and
peaceful
the
clerks
and
stenographers
went
back
to
their
ledgers
and
typewriters
the
business
callers
returned
to
the
discussion
of
their
errands
and
the
ordinary
course
of
business
was
resumed
arthur
chamberlain
was
dictating
a
letter
to
estelle
woodward
his
sole
stenographer
when
the
crash
came
he
paused
listened
and
then
resumed
his
task
it
was
not
a
difficult
one
talking
to
estelle
woodward
was
at
no
time
an
onerous
duty
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
arthur
chamberlain
found
it
difficult
to
keep
his
conversation
strictly
upon
his
business
he
was
at
this
time
engaged
in
dictating
a
letter
to
his
principal
creditors
the
gary
milton
company
explaining
that
their
demand
for
the
immediate
payment
of
the
installment
then
due
upon
his
office
furniture
was
untimely
and
unjust
a
young
and
budding
engineer
in
new
york
never
has
too
much
money
and
when
he
is
young
as
arthur
chamberlain
was
and
as
fond
of
pleasant
company
and
not
too
fond
of
economizing
he
is
liable
to
find
all
demands
for
payment
untimely
and
he
usually
considers
them
unjust
as
well
arthur
finished
dictating
the
letter
and
sighed
miss
woodward
he
said
regretfully
i
am
afraid
i
shall
never
make
a
successful
man
miss
woodward
shook
her
head
vaguely
she
did
not
seem
to
take
his
remark
very
seriously
but
then
she
had
learned
never
to
take
any
of
his
remarks
seriously
she
had
been
puzzled
at
first
by
his
manner
of
treating
everything
with
a
pessimism
but
now
ignored
it
she
was
interested
in
her
own
problems
she
had
suddenly
decided
that
she
was
going
to
be
an
old
maid
and
it
bothered
her
she
had
discovered
that
she
did
not
like
any
one
well
enough
to
marry
and
she
was
in
her
year
she
was
not
a
native
of
new
york
and
the
few
young
men
she
had
met
there
she
did
not
care
for
she
had
regretfully
decided
she
was
too
finicky
too
fastidious
but
could
not
seem
to
help
herself
she
could
not
understand
their
absorption
in
boxing
and
baseball
and
she
did
not
like
the
way
they
danced
she
had
considered
the
matter
and
decided
that
she
would
have
to
reconsider
her
former
opinion
of
women
who
did
not
marry
heretofore
she
had
thought
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
them
now
she
believed
that
she
would
come
to
their
own
estate
and
probably
for
the
same
reason
she
could
not
fall
in
love
and
she
wanted
to
she
read
all
the
popular
novels
and
thrilled
at
the
contained
in
them
but
when
any
of
the
young
men
she
knew
became
in
the
slightest
degree
sentimental
she
found
herself
bored
and
disgusted
with
herself
for
being
bored
still
she
could
not
help
it
and
was
struggling
to
reconcile
herself
to
a
life
without
romance
she
was
far
too
pretty
for
that
of
course
and
arthur
chamberlain
often
longed
to
tell
her
how
pretty
she
really
was
but
her
abstracted
air
held
him
at
arms
length
he
lay
back
at
ease
in
his
and
considered
looking
at
her
with
unfeigned
pleasure
she
did
not
notice
it
for
she
was
so
much
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
that
she
rarely
noticed
anything
he
said
or
did
when
they
were
not
in
the
line
of
her
duties
miss
woodward
he
repeated
i
said
i
think
i
never
make
a
successful
man
do
you
know
what
that
means
she
looked
at
him
mutely
polite
inquiry
in
her
eyes
it
means
he
said
gravely
that
i
going
broke
unless
something
turns
up
in
the
next
three
weeks
or
a
month
at
the
latest
have
to
get
a
job
and
that
means
she
asked
all
this
will
go
to
pot
he
explained
with
a
sweeping
gesture
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
as
much
in
advance
as
i
could
you
mean
you
going
to
give
up
your
office
and
me
she
asked
a
little
alarmed
giving
up
you
will
be
the
harder
of
the
two
he
said
with
a
smile
but
that
what
it
means
you
have
no
difficulty
finding
a
new
place
with
three
weeks
in
which
to
look
for
one
but
i
sorry
i
sorry
too
chamberlain
she
said
her
brow
puckered
she
was
not
really
frightened
because
she
knew
she
could
get
another
position
but
she
became
aware
of
rather
more
regret
than
she
had
expected
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
jove
said
arthur
suddenly
it
getting
dark
is
it
it
was
it
was
growing
dark
with
unusual
rapidity
arthur
went
to
his
window
and
looked
out
funny
he
remarked
in
a
moment
or
two
things
do
look
just
right
down
there
somehow
there
are
very
few
people
about
he
watched
in
growing
amazement
lights
came
on
in
the
streets
below
but
none
of
the
buildings
lighted
up
it
grew
darker
and
darker
it
should
be
dark
at
this
hour
arthur
exclaimed
estelle
went
to
the
window
by
his
side
it
looks
awfully
queer
she
agreed
it
must
be
an
eclipse
or
something
they
heard
doors
open
in
the
hall
outside
and
arthur
ran
out
the
halls
were
beginning
to
fill
with
excited
people
what
on
earth
the
matter
asked
a
worried
stenographer
probably
an
eclipse
replied
arthur
only
it
odd
we
read
about
it
in
the
papers
he
glanced
along
the
corridor
no
one
else
seemed
better
informed
than
he
and
he
went
back
into
his
office
estelle
turned
from
the
window
as
he
appeared
the
streets
are
deserted
she
said
in
a
puzzled
tone
the
matter
did
you
hear
arthur
shook
his
head
and
reached
for
the
telephone
i
call
up
and
find
out
he
said
confidently
he
held
the
receiver
to
his
ear
what
the
he
exclaimed
listen
to
this
a
roar
was
coming
from
the
receiver
arthur
hung
up
and
turned
a
blank
face
upon
estelle
look
she
said
suddenly
and
pointed
out
of
the
window
all
the
city
was
now
lighted
up
and
such
of
the
signs
as
they
could
see
were
brilliantly
illumined
they
watched
in
silence
the
streets
once
more
seemed
filled
with
vehicles
they
darted
along
their
headlamps
lighting
up
the
roadway
brilliantly
there
was
however
something
strange
even
about
their
motion
arthur
and
estelle
watched
in
growing
amazement
and
perplexity
are
are
you
seeing
what
i
am
seeing
asked
estelle
breathlessly
see
them
arthur
watched
and
collapsed
into
a
chair
for
the
love
of
mike
he
exclaimed
softly
ii
he
was
roused
by
another
exclamation
from
estelle
it
getting
light
again
she
said
arthur
rose
and
went
eagerly
to
the
window
the
darkness
was
becoming
less
intense
but
in
a
way
arthur
could
hardly
credit
far
to
the
west
over
beyond
the
jersey
hills
easily
visible
from
the
height
at
which
arthur
office
was
located
a
faint
light
appeared
in
the
sky
grew
stronger
and
then
took
on
a
reddish
tint
that
in
turn
grew
deeper
and
at
last
the
sun
appeared
rising
unconcernedly
the
arthur
gasped
the
streets
below
continued
to
be
thronged
with
people
and
the
sun
was
traveling
with
extraordinary
rapidity
it
rose
overhead
and
as
if
by
magic
the
streets
were
thronged
with
people
every
one
seemed
to
be
running
at
the
few
teams
they
saw
moved
at
a
breakneck
pace
backward
in
spite
of
the
suddenly
topsyturvy
state
of
affairs
there
seemed
to
be
no
accidents
arthur
put
his
hands
to
his
head
miss
woodward
he
said
pathetically
i
afraid
i
gone
crazy
do
you
see
the
same
things
i
do
estelle
nodded
her
eyes
wide
open
what
the
matter
she
asked
helplessly
she
turned
again
to
the
window
the
square
was
almost
empty
once
more
the
still
traveling
about
the
streets
were
going
so
swiftly
they
were
hardly
visible
their
speed
seemed
to
increase
steadily
soon
it
was
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
them
and
only
a
grayish
blur
marked
their
paths
along
fifth
avenue
and
street
it
grew
dusk
and
then
rapidly
dark
as
their
office
was
on
the
western
side
of
the
building
they
could
not
see
that
the
sun
had
sunk
in
the
east
but
subconsciously
they
realized
that
this
must
be
the
case
in
silence
they
watched
the
panorama
grow
black
except
for
the
remain
thus
for
a
time
and
then
suddenly
spring
into
brilliantly
illuminated
activity
again
this
lasted
for
a
little
while
and
the
west
once
more
began
to
glow
the
sun
rose
somewhat
more
hastily
from
the
jersey
hills
and
began
to
soar
overhead
but
very
soon
darkness
fell
again
with
hardly
an
interval
the
city
became
illuminated
and
then
the
west
grew
red
once
more
apparently
said
arthur
steadying
his
voice
with
a
conscious
effort
there
been
a
cataclysm
somewhere
the
direction
of
the
earth
rotation
has
been
reversed
and
its
speed
immensely
increased
it
seems
to
take
only
about
five
minutes
for
a
rotation
now
as
he
spoke
darkness
fell
for
the
third
time
estelle
turned
from
the
window
with
a
white
face
what
going
to
happen
she
cried
i
do
know
answered
arthur
the
scientist
fellows
tell
us
if
the
earth
were
to
spin
fast
enough
the
centrifugal
force
would
throw
us
all
off
into
space
perhaps
that
what
going
to
happen
estelle
sank
into
a
chair
and
stared
at
him
appalled
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
behind
them
with
a
start
estelle
jumped
to
her
feet
and
turned
a
little
gilt
clock
over
her
lay
in
fragments
arthur
hastily
glanced
at
his
own
watch
great
bombs
and
little
he
shouted
look
at
this
his
watch
trembled
and
quivered
in
his
hand
the
hands
were
going
around
so
swiftly
it
was
impossible
to
watch
the
and
the
traveled
like
the
wind
while
they
looked
it
made
two
complete
revolutions
in
one
of
them
the
glory
of
daylight
had
waxed
waned
and
vanished
in
the
other
darkness
reigned
except
for
the
glow
from
the
electric
light
overhead
there
was
a
sudden
tension
and
catch
in
the
watch
arthur
dropped
it
instantly
it
flew
to
pieces
before
it
reached
the
floor
if
you
got
a
watch
arthur
ordered
swiftly
stop
it
this
instant
estelle
fumbled
at
her
wrist
arthur
tore
the
watch
from
her
hand
and
threw
open
the
case
the
machinery
inside
was
going
so
swiftly
it
was
hardly
visible
relentlessly
arthur
jabbed
a
penholder
in
the
works
there
was
a
sharp
click
and
the
watch
was
still
arthur
ran
to
the
window
as
he
reached
it
the
sun
rushed
up
day
lasted
a
moment
there
was
darkness
and
then
the
sun
appeared
again
miss
woodward
arthur
ordered
suddenly
look
at
the
ground
estelle
glanced
down
the
next
time
the
sun
flashed
into
view
she
gasped
the
ground
was
white
with
snow
what
happened
she
demanded
terrified
oh
what
happened
arthur
fumbled
at
his
chin
awkwardly
watching
the
astonishing
panorama
outside
there
was
hardly
any
distinguishing
between
the
times
the
sun
was
up
and
the
times
it
was
below
now
as
the
darkness
and
light
followed
each
other
so
swiftly
the
effect
was
the
same
as
one
of
the
old
flickering
as
arthur
watched
this
effect
became
more
pronounced
the
tall
fifth
avenue
building
across
the
way
began
to
disintegrate
in
a
moment
it
seemed
there
was
only
a
skeleton
there
then
that
vanished
story
by
story
a
great
cavity
in
the
earth
appeared
and
then
another
building
became
visible
a
smaller
unimpressive
structure
with
bulging
eyes
arthur
stared
across
the
city
except
for
the
flickering
he
could
see
almost
clearly
now
he
no
longer
saw
the
sun
rise
and
set
there
was
merely
a
streak
of
unpleasantly
brilliant
light
across
the
sky
bit
by
bit
building
by
building
the
city
began
to
disintegrate
and
become
replaced
by
smaller
dingier
buildings
in
a
little
while
those
began
to
disappear
and
leave
gaps
where
they
vanished
arthur
strained
his
eyes
and
looked
far
he
saw
a
forest
of
masts
and
spars
along
the
waterfront
for
a
moment
and
when
he
turned
his
eyes
again
to
the
scenery
near
him
it
was
almost
barren
of
houses
and
what
few
showed
were
mean
small
residences
apparently
set
in
the
midst
of
farms
and
plantations
estelle
was
sobbing
oh
chamberlain
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
arthur
had
lost
his
fear
of
what
their
fate
would
be
in
his
absorbing
interest
in
what
he
saw
he
was
staring
out
of
the
window
lost
in
the
sight
before
him
at
estelle
cry
however
he
reluctantly
left
the
window
and
patted
her
shoulder
awkwardly
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
he
said
uncomfortably
but
obvious
that
my
first
surmise
was
all
wrong
the
speed
of
the
rotation
ca
have
been
increased
because
if
it
had
to
the
extent
we
see
we
have
been
thrown
off
into
space
long
ago
but
have
you
read
anything
about
the
fourth
dimension
estelle
shook
her
head
hopelessly
well
then
have
you
ever
read
anything
by
wells
the
machine
for
instance
again
she
shook
her
head
i
do
know
how
i
going
to
say
it
so
you
understand
but
time
is
just
as
much
a
dimension
as
length
and
breadth
from
what
i
can
judge
i
say
there
has
been
an
earthquake
and
the
ground
has
settled
a
little
with
our
building
on
it
only
instead
of
settling
down
toward
the
center
of
the
earth
or
it
settled
in
this
fourth
dimension
but
what
does
that
mean
asked
estelle
uncomprehendingly
if
the
earth
had
settled
down
we
have
been
lower
if
it
had
settled
to
one
side
we
have
been
moved
one
way
or
another
but
as
it
settled
back
in
the
fourth
dimension
we
going
back
in
time
then
we
in
a
runaway
skyscraper
bound
for
some
time
back
before
the
discovery
of
america
iii
it
was
very
still
in
the
office
except
for
the
flickering
outside
everything
seemed
very
much
as
usual
the
electric
light
burned
steadily
but
estelle
was
sobbing
with
fright
and
arthur
was
trying
vainly
to
console
her
have
i
gone
crazy
she
demanded
between
her
sobs
not
unless
i
gone
mad
too
said
arthur
soothingly
the
excitement
had
quite
a
soothing
effect
upon
him
he
had
ceased
to
feel
afraid
but
was
simply
waiting
to
see
what
had
happened
way
back
before
the
founding
of
new
york
now
and
still
going
strong
are
you
sure
that
what
has
happened
if
you
look
outside
he
suggested
you
see
the
seasons
following
each
other
in
reverse
order
one
moment
the
snow
covers
all
the
ground
then
you
catch
a
glimpse
of
autumn
foliage
then
summer
follows
and
next
spring
estelle
glanced
out
of
the
window
and
covered
her
eyes
not
a
house
she
said
despairingly
not
a
building
nothing
nothing
nothing
arthur
slipped
his
arm
about
her
and
patted
hers
comfortingly
it
all
right
he
reassured
her
we
bring
up
presently
and
there
we
be
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
she
rested
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
sobbed
hopelessly
for
a
little
while
longer
but
presently
quieted
then
suddenly
realizing
that
arthur
arm
was
about
her
and
that
she
was
crying
on
his
shoulder
she
sprang
away
blushing
crimson
arthur
walked
to
the
window
look
there
he
exclaimed
but
it
was
too
late
i
swear
to
it
i
saw
the
half
moon
hudson
ship
he
declared
excitedly
we
way
back
now
and
do
seem
to
be
slacking
up
either
estelle
came
to
the
window
by
his
side
the
rapidly
changing
scene
before
her
made
her
gasp
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
distinguish
night
from
day
a
wavering
streak
moving
first
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
showed
where
the
sun
flashed
across
the
sky
what
makes
the
sun
wabble
so
she
asked
moving
north
and
south
of
the
equator
arthur
explained
casually
when
it
farthest
south
to
the
left
there
always
snow
on
the
ground
when
it
farthest
right
it
summer
see
how
green
it
is
a
few
moments
observation
corroborated
his
statement
i
say
arthur
remarked
reflectively
that
it
takes
about
fifteen
seconds
for
the
sun
to
make
the
round
trip
from
farthest
north
to
farthest
south
he
felt
his
pulse
do
you
know
the
normal
rate
of
the
we
can
judge
time
that
way
a
clock
will
go
all
to
pieces
of
course
why
did
your
watch
explode
and
the
clock
running
forward
in
time
unwinds
a
clock
does
it
asked
arthur
it
follows
of
course
that
when
you
move
it
backward
in
time
it
winds
up
when
you
move
it
too
far
back
you
wind
it
so
tightly
that
the
spring
just
breaks
to
pieces
he
paused
a
moment
his
fingers
on
his
pulse
yes
it
takes
about
fifteen
seconds
for
all
the
four
seasons
to
pass
that
means
we
going
backward
in
time
about
four
years
a
minute
if
we
go
on
at
this
rate
another
hour
we
be
back
in
the
time
of
the
northmen
and
will
be
able
to
tell
if
they
did
discover
america
after
all
funny
we
do
hear
any
noises
estelle
observed
she
had
caught
some
of
arthur
calmness
it
passes
so
quickly
that
though
our
ears
hear
it
we
do
separate
the
sounds
if
you
notice
you
do
hear
a
sort
of
humming
it
very
though
estelle
listened
but
could
hear
nothing
no
matter
said
arthur
it
probably
a
little
higher
than
your
ears
will
catch
lots
of
people
ca
hear
a
bat
squeak
i
never
could
said
estelle
out
in
the
country
where
i
come
from
other
people
could
hear
them
but
i
could
they
stood
a
while
in
silence
watching
when
are
we
going
to
stop
asked
estelle
uneasily
it
seems
as
if
we
going
to
keep
on
indefinitely
i
guess
we
stop
all
right
arthur
reassured
her
it
obvious
that
whatever
it
was
only
affected
our
own
building
or
we
see
some
other
one
with
us
it
looks
like
a
fault
or
a
flaw
in
the
rock
the
building
rests
on
and
that
can
only
give
so
far
estelle
was
silent
for
a
moment
oh
i
ca
be
sane
she
burst
out
semihysterically
this
be
happening
you
are
crazy
said
arthur
sharply
you
sane
as
i
am
just
something
queer
is
happening
buck
up
say
your
multiplication
tables
say
anything
you
know
say
something
sensible
and
know
you
all
right
but
do
get
frightened
now
there
be
plenty
to
get
frightened
about
later
the
grimness
in
his
tone
alarmed
estelle
what
are
you
afraid
of
she
asked
quickly
time
enough
to
worry
when
it
happens
arthur
retorted
briefly
you
you
are
afraid
we
go
back
before
the
beginning
of
the
world
are
you
asked
estelle
in
sudden
access
of
fright
arthur
shook
his
head
tell
me
said
estelle
more
quietly
getting
a
grip
on
herself
i
wo
mind
but
please
tell
me
arthur
glanced
at
her
her
face
was
pale
but
there
was
more
resolution
in
it
than
he
had
expected
to
find
i
tell
you
then
he
said
reluctantly
we
going
back
a
little
faster
than
we
were
and
the
flaw
seems
to
be
a
deeper
one
than
i
thought
at
the
roughest
kind
of
an
estimate
we
all
of
a
thousand
years
before
the
discovery
of
america
now
and
i
think
nearer
three
or
four
and
we
gaining
speed
all
the
time
so
though
i
am
as
sure
as
i
can
be
sure
of
anything
that
we
stop
this
eventually
i
do
know
where
it
like
a
crevasse
in
the
earth
opened
by
an
earthquake
which
may
be
only
a
few
feet
deep
or
it
may
be
hundreds
of
yards
or
even
a
mile
or
two
we
started
off
smoothly
we
going
at
a
terrific
rate
will
happen
when
we
stop
estelle
caught
her
breath
what
she
asked
quietly
i
do
know
said
arthur
in
an
irritated
tone
to
cover
his
apprehension
how
could
i
know
estelle
turned
from
him
to
the
window
again
look
she
said
pointing
the
flickering
had
begun
again
while
they
stared
hope
springing
up
once
more
in
their
hearts
it
became
more
pronounced
soon
they
could
distinctly
see
the
difference
between
day
and
night
they
were
slowing
up
the
white
snow
on
the
ground
remained
there
for
an
appreciable
time
autumn
lasted
quite
a
while
they
could
catch
the
flashes
of
the
sun
as
it
made
its
revolutions
now
instead
of
its
seeming
like
a
ribbon
of
fire
at
last
day
lasted
all
of
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
it
grew
longer
and
longer
then
half
an
hour
then
an
hour
the
sun
wavered
in
midheaven
and
was
still
far
below
them
the
watchers
in
the
tower
of
the
skyscraper
saw
trees
swaying
and
bending
in
the
wind
though
there
was
not
a
house
or
a
habitation
to
be
seen
and
a
dense
forest
covered
all
of
manhattan
island
such
of
the
world
as
they
could
see
looked
normal
wherever
or
rather
in
whatever
epoch
of
time
they
were
they
had
arrived
iv
arthur
caught
at
estelle
arm
and
the
two
made
a
dash
for
the
elevators
fortunately
one
was
standing
still
the
door
open
on
their
floor
the
had
deserted
his
post
and
was
looking
with
all
the
rest
of
the
occupants
of
the
building
at
the
strange
landscape
that
surrounded
them
no
sooner
had
the
pair
reached
the
car
however
than
the
boy
came
hurrying
along
the
corridor
three
or
four
other
people
following
him
also
at
a
run
without
a
word
the
boy
rushed
inside
the
others
crowded
after
him
and
the
car
shot
downward
all
of
the
newcomers
panting
from
their
sprint
theirs
was
the
first
car
to
reach
the
bottom
they
rushed
out
and
to
the
western
door
here
where
they
had
been
accustomed
to
see
madison
square
spread
out
before
them
a
clearing
of
perhaps
half
an
acre
in
extent
showed
itself
where
their
eyes
instinctively
looked
for
the
dark
bronze
fountain
near
which
orators
aforetime
held
sway
they
saw
a
tent
a
wigwam
of
hides
and
bark
gaily
painted
and
before
the
wigwam
were
two
or
three
indians
utterly
petrified
with
astonishment
behind
the
first
wigwam
were
others
painted
like
the
first
with
daubs
of
brightly
colored
clay
from
them
too
indians
issued
and
stared
in
incredulous
amazement
their
eyes
growing
wider
and
wider
when
the
group
of
white
people
confronted
the
indians
there
was
a
moment
deathlike
silence
then
with
a
wild
yell
the
redskins
broke
and
ran
not
stopping
to
gather
together
their
belongings
nor
pausing
for
even
a
second
glance
at
the
weird
strangers
who
invaded
their
domain
arthur
took
two
or
three
deep
breaths
of
the
fresh
air
and
found
himself
even
then
comparing
its
quality
with
that
of
the
city
estelle
stared
about
her
with
unbelieving
eyes
she
turned
and
saw
the
great
bulk
of
the
office
building
behind
her
then
faced
this
small
clearing
with
a
virgin
forest
on
its
farther
side
she
found
herself
trembling
from
some
undefined
cause
arthur
glanced
at
her
he
saw
the
trembling
and
knew
she
would
have
a
fit
of
nerves
in
a
moment
if
something
did
not
come
up
demanding
instant
attention
we
better
take
a
look
at
this
village
he
said
in
an
voice
we
can
probably
find
out
how
long
ago
it
is
from
the
weapons
and
so
on
he
grasped
her
arm
firmly
and
led
her
in
the
direction
of
the
tents
the
other
people
left
behind
displayed
their
emotions
in
different
ways
two
or
three
of
them
women
sat
frankly
down
on
the
steps
and
indulged
in
tears
of
bewilderment
fright
and
relief
in
a
peculiar
combination
defying
analysis
two
or
three
of
the
men
swore
in
shaken
voices
meantime
the
elevators
inside
the
building
were
rushing
and
clanging
and
the
hall
filled
with
a
mob
desperately
anxious
to
find
out
what
had
happened
and
why
the
people
poured
out
of
the
door
and
stared
about
blankly
there
was
a
peculiar
expression
of
doubt
on
every
one
of
their
faces
each
one
was
asking
himself
if
he
were
awake
and
having
proved
that
by
pinches
openly
administered
the
next
query
was
whether
they
had
gone
mad
arthur
led
estelle
cautiously
among
the
tents
the
village
contained
about
a
dozen
wigwams
most
of
them
were
made
of
strips
of
cleverly
overlapping
each
other
the
seams
cemented
with
gum
all
had
hide
flaps
for
doors
and
one
or
two
were
built
almost
entirely
of
hides
sewed
together
with
strips
of
sinew
arthur
made
only
a
cursory
examination
of
the
village
his
principal
motive
in
taking
estelle
there
was
to
give
her
some
mental
occupation
to
ward
off
the
reaction
from
the
excitement
of
the
cataclysm
he
looked
into
one
or
two
of
the
tents
and
found
merely
couches
of
hides
with
minor
domestic
utensils
scattered
about
he
brought
from
one
tent
a
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
the
workmanship
was
good
but
very
evidently
the
maker
had
no
knowledge
of
metal
tools
arthur
acquaintance
with
archeological
subjects
was
very
slight
but
he
observed
that
the
were
chipped
and
not
rubbed
smooth
they
were
attached
to
the
shafts
with
strips
of
gut
or
tendon
arthur
was
still
pursuing
his
investigation
when
a
sob
from
estelle
made
him
stop
and
look
at
her
oh
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
asked
tearfully
what
we
going
to
do
where
are
we
you
mean
are
we
arthur
corrected
with
a
grim
smile
i
do
know
way
back
before
the
discovery
of
america
though
you
can
see
in
everything
in
the
village
that
there
is
a
trace
of
european
civilization
i
suspect
that
we
are
several
thousand
years
back
i
ca
tell
of
course
but
this
pottery
makes
me
think
so
see
this
bowl
he
pointed
to
a
bowl
of
red
clay
lying
on
the
ground
before
one
of
the
wigwams
if
you
look
you
see
that
it
is
really
pottery
at
all
a
basket
that
was
woven
of
reeds
and
then
smeared
with
clay
to
make
it
the
people
who
made
that
did
know
about
baking
clay
to
make
it
stay
put
when
america
was
discovered
nearly
all
the
tribes
knew
something
about
pottery
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
estelle
tearfully
insisted
we
going
to
muddle
along
as
well
as
we
can
answered
arthur
cheerfully
until
we
can
get
back
to
where
we
started
from
maybe
the
people
back
in
the
twentieth
century
can
send
a
relief
party
after
us
when
the
skyscraper
vanished
it
must
have
left
a
hole
of
some
sort
and
it
may
be
possible
for
them
to
follow
us
down
if
that
so
said
estelle
quickly
why
ca
we
climb
up
it
without
waiting
for
them
to
come
after
us
arthur
scratched
his
head
he
looked
across
the
clearing
at
the
skyscraper
it
seemed
to
rest
very
solidly
on
the
ground
he
looked
up
the
sky
seemed
normal
to
tell
the
truth
he
admitted
there
does
seem
to
be
any
hole
i
said
that
more
to
cheer
you
up
than
anything
else
estelle
clenched
her
hands
tightly
and
took
a
grip
on
herself
just
tell
me
the
truth
she
said
quietly
i
was
rather
foolish
but
tell
me
what
you
honestly
think
arthur
eyed
her
keenly
in
that
case
he
said
reluctantly
i
admit
we
in
a
pretty
bad
fix
i
do
know
what
has
happened
how
it
happened
or
anything
about
it
i
just
going
to
keep
on
going
until
i
see
a
way
clear
to
get
out
of
this
mess
there
are
two
thousand
of
us
people
more
or
less
and
among
all
of
us
we
must
be
able
to
find
a
way
out
estelle
had
turned
very
pale
we
in
no
great
danger
from
indians
went
on
arthur
thoughtfully
or
from
anything
else
that
i
know
of
except
one
thing
what
is
that
asked
estelle
quickly
arthur
shook
his
head
and
led
her
back
toward
the
skyscraper
which
was
now
thronged
with
the
people
from
all
the
floors
who
had
come
down
to
the
ground
and
were
standing
excitedly
about
the
concourse
asking
each
other
what
had
happened
arthur
led
estelle
to
one
of
the
corners
wait
for
me
here
he
ordered
i
going
to
talk
to
this
crowd
he
pushed
his
way
through
until
he
could
reach
the
confectionery
and
in
the
main
hallway
here
he
climbed
up
on
the
counter
and
shouted
people
listen
to
me
i
going
to
tell
you
what
happened
in
an
instant
there
was
dead
silence
he
found
himself
the
center
of
a
sea
of
white
faces
every
one
contorted
with
fear
and
anxiety
to
begin
with
he
said
confidently
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
we
going
to
get
back
to
where
we
started
from
i
know
how
yet
but
we
do
it
do
get
frightened
now
tell
you
what
happened
he
rapidly
sketched
out
for
them
in
words
as
simple
as
he
could
make
them
his
theory
that
a
flaw
in
the
rock
on
which
the
foundations
rested
had
developed
and
let
the
skyscraper
sink
not
downward
but
into
the
fourth
dimension
i
an
engineer
he
finished
what
nature
can
do
we
can
imitate
nature
let
us
into
this
hole
we
climb
out
in
the
mean
time
matters
are
serious
we
need
be
afraid
of
not
getting
back
we
do
that
what
we
got
to
fight
is
starvation
we
got
to
fight
starvation
and
we
got
to
beat
it
arthur
continued
doggedly
i
telling
you
this
right
at
the
outset
because
i
want
you
to
begin
right
at
the
beginning
and
pitch
in
to
help
we
have
very
little
food
and
a
lot
of
us
to
eat
it
first
i
want
some
volunteers
to
help
with
rationing
next
i
want
every
ounce
of
food
in
this
place
put
under
guard
where
it
can
be
served
to
those
who
need
it
most
who
will
help
out
with
this
the
swift
succession
of
shocks
had
paralyzed
the
faculties
of
most
of
the
people
there
but
half
a
dozen
moved
forward
among
them
was
a
single
man
with
an
air
of
accustomed
authority
arthur
recognized
him
as
the
president
of
the
bank
on
the
ground
floor
i
do
know
who
you
are
or
if
you
right
in
saying
what
has
happened
said
the
man
but
i
see
something
got
to
be
done
and
well
for
the
time
being
i
take
your
word
for
what
that
is
later
on
we
thrash
this
matter
out
arthur
nodded
he
bent
over
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
the
man
who
moved
away
grayson
walters
terhune
simpson
and
forsythe
come
here
the
man
called
at
a
doorway
a
number
of
men
began
to
press
dazedly
toward
him
arthur
resumed
his
harangue
you
people
those
of
you
who
are
too
dazed
to
think
are
remembering
there
a
restaurant
in
the
building
and
no
need
to
starve
you
wrong
there
are
nearly
two
thousand
of
us
here
that
means
six
thousand
meals
a
day
we
got
to
have
nearly
ten
tons
of
food
a
day
and
we
got
to
have
it
at
once
hunt
some
one
suggested
i
saw
indians
some
one
else
shouted
can
we
trade
with
them
we
can
hunt
and
we
can
trade
with
the
indians
arthur
admitted
but
we
need
food
by
the
ton
by
the
ton
people
the
indians
store
up
supplies
and
besides
they
much
too
scattered
to
have
a
surplus
for
us
but
we
got
to
have
food
now
how
many
of
you
know
anything
about
hunting
fishing
trapping
or
any
possible
way
of
getting
food
there
were
a
few
hands
raised
pitifully
few
arthur
saw
hand
up
very
well
he
said
those
of
you
who
raised
your
hands
then
come
with
me
up
on
the
second
floor
and
we
talk
it
over
the
rest
of
you
try
to
conquer
your
fright
and
do
go
outside
for
a
while
we
got
some
things
to
attend
to
before
it
will
be
quite
safe
for
you
to
venture
out
and
keep
away
from
the
restaurant
there
are
armed
guards
over
that
food
before
we
pass
it
out
indiscriminately
we
see
to
it
there
more
for
and
the
next
day
he
stepped
down
from
the
counter
and
moved
toward
the
stairway
it
was
not
worth
while
to
use
the
elevator
for
the
ride
of
only
one
floor
estelle
managed
to
join
him
and
they
mounted
the
steps
together
do
you
think
we
pull
through
all
right
she
asked
quietly
we
got
to
arthur
told
her
setting
his
chin
firmly
simply
got
to
the
president
of
the
bank
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
my
name
is
van
deventer
he
said
shaking
hands
with
arthur
who
gave
his
own
name
where
shall
our
emergency
council
sit
he
asked
the
bank
has
a
board
room
right
over
the
safety
vault
i
dare
say
we
can
accommodate
everybody
there
everybody
in
the
council
anyway
arthur
followed
into
the
and
the
others
trooped
in
after
him
i
just
assuming
temporary
leadership
arthur
explained
because
it
imperative
some
things
be
done
at
once
later
on
we
can
talk
about
electing
officials
to
direct
our
activities
right
now
we
need
food
how
many
of
you
can
shoot
about
a
quarter
of
the
hands
were
raised
estelle
was
among
the
number
and
how
many
are
fishermen
a
few
more
went
up
what
do
the
rest
of
you
do
there
was
a
chorus
of
gardener
i
have
a
garden
in
my
yard
i
grow
peaches
in
new
jersey
and
three
men
confessed
that
they
raised
chickens
as
a
hobby
we
want
you
gardeners
in
a
little
while
do
go
yet
but
the
most
important
are
huntsmen
and
fishermen
have
any
of
you
weapons
in
your
offices
a
number
had
revolvers
but
only
one
man
had
a
shotgun
and
shells
i
was
going
on
my
vacation
this
afternoon
straight
from
the
office
he
explained
and
have
all
my
vacation
tackle
good
man
arthur
exclaimed
you
go
after
the
heavy
game
with
a
shotgun
the
sportsman
asked
aghast
if
you
get
close
to
them
a
shotgun
will
do
as
well
as
anything
and
we
ca
waste
a
shell
on
every
bird
or
rabbit
those
shells
of
yours
are
precious
you
other
fellows
will
have
to
turn
fishermen
for
a
while
your
pistols
are
no
good
for
hunting
the
watchmen
at
the
bank
have
riot
guns
said
van
deventer
and
there
are
one
or
two
there
i
do
know
about
ammunition
good
i
do
mean
about
the
ammunition
but
about
the
guns
hope
for
the
ammunition
you
fishermen
get
to
work
to
improvise
tackle
out
of
anything
you
can
get
hold
of
will
you
do
that
a
series
of
nods
answered
his
question
now
for
the
gardeners
you
people
will
have
to
roam
through
the
woods
in
company
with
the
hunters
and
locate
anything
in
the
way
of
edibles
that
grows
do
all
of
you
know
what
wild
plants
look
like
i
mean
wild
fruits
and
vegetables
that
are
good
to
eat
a
few
of
them
nodded
but
the
majority
looked
dubious
the
consensus
of
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
they
would
try
arthur
seemed
a
little
discouraged
i
guess
you
the
man
to
tell
about
the
restaurant
van
deventer
said
quietly
and
as
this
is
the
food
commission
or
something
of
that
sort
everybody
here
will
be
better
for
hearing
it
anyway
everybody
will
have
to
know
it
before
night
i
took
over
the
restaurant
as
you
suggested
and
posted
some
of
the
men
from
the
bank
that
i
knew
i
could
trust
about
the
doors
but
there
was
hardly
any
use
in
doing
it
the
restaurant
stocks
up
in
the
afternoon
as
most
of
its
business
is
in
the
morning
and
at
noon
it
only
carries
a
stock
of
foodstuffs
and
the
the
cataclysm
or
whatever
it
was
came
at
three
there
is
practically
nothing
in
the
place
we
could
make
sandwiches
for
half
the
women
that
are
caught
with
us
let
alone
the
men
everybody
will
go
hungry
there
will
be
no
breakfast
nor
anything
to
eat
until
we
either
make
arrangements
with
the
indians
for
some
supplies
or
else
get
food
for
ourselves
arthur
leaned
his
jaw
on
his
hand
and
considered
a
slow
flush
crept
over
his
cheek
he
was
getting
his
fighting
blood
up
at
school
when
he
began
to
flush
slowly
his
schoolmates
had
known
the
symptom
and
avoided
his
wrath
now
he
was
growing
angry
with
mere
circumstances
but
it
would
be
none
the
less
unfortunate
for
those
circumstances
well
he
said
at
last
deliberately
we
got
to
what
that
there
was
a
great
creaking
and
groaning
suddenly
a
sort
of
vibration
was
felt
under
foot
the
floor
began
to
take
on
a
slight
slant
great
heaven
some
one
cried
the
building
turning
over
and
we
be
buried
in
the
ruins
the
tilt
of
the
floor
became
more
pronounced
an
empty
chair
slid
to
one
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
crash
vi
arthur
woke
to
find
some
one
tugging
at
his
shoulders
trying
to
drag
him
from
beneath
the
heavy
table
which
had
wedged
itself
across
his
feet
and
pinned
him
fast
while
a
flying
chair
had
struck
him
on
the
head
and
knocked
him
unconscious
oh
come
and
help
estelle
voice
was
calling
deliberately
somebody
come
and
help
he
caught
in
here
she
was
sobbing
in
a
combination
of
panic
and
some
unknown
emotion
help
me
please
she
gasped
then
her
voice
broke
despondently
but
she
never
ceased
to
tug
ineffectually
at
chamberlain
trying
to
drag
him
out
of
the
mass
of
wreckage
arthur
moved
a
little
dazedly
are
you
alive
she
called
anxiously
are
you
alive
hurry
oh
hurry
and
wriggle
out
the
building
falling
to
pieces
i
all
right
arthur
said
weakly
you
get
out
before
it
all
comes
down
i
wo
leave
you
she
declared
where
are
you
caught
are
you
badly
hurt
hurry
please
hurry
arthur
stirred
but
could
not
loosen
his
feet
he
over
and
the
table
moved
as
if
it
had
been
precariously
balanced
and
slid
heavily
to
one
side
with
estelle
still
tugging
at
him
he
managed
to
get
to
his
feet
on
the
slanting
floor
and
stared
about
him
arthur
continued
to
stare
about
no
danger
he
said
weakly
just
the
floor
of
the
one
room
gave
way
the
aftermath
of
the
he
made
his
way
across
the
splintered
flooring
and
chairs
we
on
top
of
the
vault
he
said
that
why
we
did
fall
all
the
way
to
the
floor
below
i
wonder
how
going
to
get
down
estelle
followed
him
still
frightened
for
fear
of
the
building
falling
upon
them
some
of
the
long
stretched
over
the
edge
of
the
vault
and
rested
on
a
tall
bronze
grating
that
protected
the
approach
to
the
massive
arthur
tested
them
with
his
foot
they
seem
to
be
pretty
solid
he
said
tentatively
his
strength
was
coming
back
to
him
every
moment
he
had
been
no
more
than
stunned
he
walked
out
on
the
planking
to
the
bronze
grating
and
turned
if
you
do
get
dizzy
you
might
come
on
he
said
we
can
swing
down
the
grille
here
to
the
floor
estelle
followed
gingerly
and
in
a
moment
they
were
safely
below
the
corridor
was
quite
empty
when
the
crash
came
estelle
explained
her
voice
shaking
with
the
reaction
from
her
fear
of
a
moment
ago
every
one
thought
the
building
was
coming
to
pieces
and
ran
out
i
afraid
they
all
run
away
they
be
back
in
a
little
while
arthur
said
quietly
they
went
along
the
big
marble
corridor
to
the
same
western
door
out
of
which
they
had
first
gone
to
see
the
indian
village
as
they
emerged
into
the
sunlight
they
met
a
few
of
the
people
who
had
already
recovered
from
their
panic
and
were
returning
a
crowd
of
respectable
size
gathered
in
a
few
moments
all
still
pale
and
shaken
but
coming
back
to
the
building
which
was
their
refuge
arthur
leaned
wearily
against
the
cold
stone
it
seemed
to
vibrate
under
his
touch
he
turned
quickly
to
estelle
feel
this
he
exclaimed
she
did
so
i
been
wondering
what
that
rumble
was
she
said
i
been
hearing
it
ever
since
we
landed
here
but
did
understand
where
it
came
from
you
hear
a
rumble
arthur
asked
puzzled
i
ca
hear
anything
it
is
as
loud
as
it
was
but
i
hear
it
estelle
insisted
very
deep
like
the
lowest
possible
bass
note
of
an
organ
you
could
hear
the
shrill
whistle
when
we
were
coming
here
arthur
exclaimed
suddenly
and
you
ca
hear
the
squeak
of
a
bat
of
course
your
ears
are
pitched
lower
than
usual
and
you
can
hear
sounds
that
are
lower
than
i
can
hear
listen
carefully
does
it
sound
in
the
least
like
a
liquid
rushing
through
somewhere
said
estelle
hesitatingly
somehow
i
do
quite
understand
how
it
gives
me
the
impression
of
a
tidal
flow
or
something
of
that
sort
arthur
rushed
indoors
when
estelle
followed
him
she
found
him
excitedly
examining
the
marble
floor
about
the
base
of
the
vault
it
cracked
he
said
excitedly
it
cracked
the
vault
rose
all
of
an
inch
estelle
looked
and
saw
the
cracks
what
does
that
mean
it
means
we
going
to
get
back
where
we
belong
arthur
cried
jubilantly
it
means
i
on
the
track
of
the
whole
trouble
it
means
everything
going
to
be
all
right
he
prowled
about
the
vault
exultantly
noting
exactly
how
the
cracks
in
the
flooring
ran
and
seeing
in
each
a
corroboration
of
his
theory
i
have
to
make
some
inspections
in
the
cellar
he
went
on
happily
but
i
nearly
sure
i
on
the
right
track
and
can
figure
out
a
corrective
how
soon
can
we
hope
to
start
back
asked
estelle
eagerly
arthur
hesitated
then
a
great
deal
of
the
excitement
ebbed
from
his
face
leaving
it
rather
worried
and
stern
it
may
be
a
month
or
two
months
or
a
year
he
answered
gravely
i
do
know
if
the
first
thing
i
try
will
work
it
wo
be
long
if
we
have
to
experiment
i
dare
guess
how
long
we
may
be
but
his
chin
set
firmly
we
going
to
get
back
estelle
looked
at
him
speculatively
her
own
expression
grew
a
little
worried
too
but
in
a
month
she
said
dubiously
we
there
is
hardly
any
hope
of
our
finding
food
for
two
thousand
people
for
a
month
is
there
we
got
to
arthur
declared
we
ca
hope
to
get
that
much
food
from
the
indians
it
will
be
days
before
they
dare
to
come
back
to
their
village
if
they
ever
come
it
will
be
weeks
before
we
can
hope
to
have
them
earnestly
at
work
to
feed
us
and
leaving
aside
the
question
of
how
we
communicate
with
them
and
how
we
manage
to
trade
with
them
frankly
i
think
everybody
is
going
to
have
to
draw
his
belt
tight
before
we
get
through
if
we
do
some
of
us
will
get
along
anyway
estelle
eyes
opened
wide
as
the
meaning
of
his
last
sentence
penetrated
her
mind
you
mean
that
all
of
us
wo
i
going
to
take
care
of
you
arthur
said
gravely
but
there
are
liable
to
be
lively
doings
around
here
when
people
begin
to
realize
they
really
in
a
tight
fix
for
food
i
going
to
get
van
deventer
to
help
me
organize
a
police
band
to
enforce
martial
law
we
must
have
any
disorder
that
certain
and
i
trust
a
man
in
a
pinch
unless
i
know
him
he
stooped
and
picked
up
a
revolver
from
the
floor
left
there
by
one
of
the
bank
watchmen
when
he
fled
in
the
belief
that
the
building
was
falling
vii
arthur
stood
at
the
window
of
his
office
and
stared
out
toward
the
west
the
sun
was
setting
but
upon
what
a
scene
where
from
this
same
window
arthur
had
seen
the
sun
setting
behind
the
jersey
hills
all
edged
with
the
angular
roofs
of
factories
with
their
chimneys
emitting
columns
of
smoke
he
now
saw
the
same
sun
sinking
redly
behind
a
mass
of
luxuriant
foliage
and
where
he
was
accustomed
to
look
upon
the
tops
of
high
buildings
each
entitled
to
the
name
of
skyscraper
he
now
saw
miles
and
miles
of
waving
green
branches
the
wide
hudson
flowed
on
placidly
all
unruffled
by
the
arrival
of
this
strange
monument
upon
its
shores
the
same
hudson
arthur
knew
as
a
busy
thoroughfare
of
puffing
steamers
and
chugging
launches
two
or
three
small
streams
wandered
unconcernedly
across
the
land
that
arthur
had
known
as
the
most
closely
territory
on
earth
and
far
far
below
him
arthur
had
to
lean
well
out
of
his
window
to
see
it
stood
a
collection
of
tiny
wigwams
those
small
bark
structures
represented
the
original
metropolis
of
new
york
his
telephone
rang
van
deventer
was
on
the
wire
the
exchange
in
the
building
was
still
working
van
deventer
wanted
arthur
to
come
down
to
his
private
office
there
were
still
a
great
many
things
to
be
settled
the
arrangements
for
commandeering
offices
for
sleeping
quarters
for
the
women
and
numberless
other
details
the
men
who
seemed
to
have
best
kept
their
heads
were
gathering
there
to
settle
upon
a
course
of
action
arthur
glanced
out
of
the
window
again
before
going
to
the
elevator
he
saw
a
curiously
compact
dark
cloud
moving
swiftly
across
the
sky
to
the
west
miss
woodward
he
said
sharply
what
is
that
estelle
came
to
the
window
and
looked
they
are
birds
she
told
him
birds
flying
in
a
group
often
seen
them
in
the
country
though
never
as
many
as
that
how
do
you
catch
birds
arthur
asked
her
i
know
about
shooting
them
and
so
on
but
we
have
guns
enough
to
count
could
we
catch
them
in
traps
do
you
think
i
would
be
surprised
said
estelle
thoughtfully
but
it
would
be
hard
to
catch
many
come
directed
arthur
you
know
as
much
as
any
of
the
men
here
and
more
than
most
apparently
we
going
to
make
you
show
us
how
to
catch
things
estelle
smiled
a
trifle
wanly
arthur
led
the
way
to
the
elevator
in
the
car
he
noticed
that
she
looked
distressed
what
the
matter
he
asked
you
are
really
frightened
are
you
no
she
answered
shakily
but
i
rather
upset
about
this
thing
it
so
so
terrible
somehow
to
be
back
here
thousands
of
miles
or
years
away
from
all
one
friends
and
everybody
please
arthur
smiled
encouragingly
at
her
please
count
me
your
friend
wo
you
she
nodded
but
blinked
back
some
tears
arthur
would
have
tried
to
hearten
her
further
but
the
elevator
stopped
at
their
floor
they
walked
into
the
room
where
the
meeting
of
cool
heads
was
to
take
place
no
more
than
a
dozen
men
were
in
there
talking
earnestly
but
dispiritedly
when
arthur
and
estelle
entered
van
deventer
came
over
to
greet
them
we
got
to
do
something
he
said
in
a
low
voice
a
wave
of
homesickness
has
swept
over
the
whole
place
look
at
those
men
every
one
is
thinking
about
his
family
and
contrasting
his
cozy
fireside
with
all
that
wilderness
outside
you
do
seem
to
be
worried
arthur
observed
with
a
smile
van
deventer
eyes
twinkled
i
a
bachelor
he
said
cheerfully
and
i
live
in
a
hotel
been
longing
for
a
chance
to
see
some
real
excitement
for
thirty
years
business
has
kept
me
from
it
up
to
now
but
i
enjoying
myself
hugely
estelle
looked
at
the
group
of
dispirited
men
we
simply
have
to
do
something
she
said
with
a
shaky
smile
i
feel
just
as
they
do
this
morning
i
hated
the
thought
of
having
to
go
back
to
my
but
right
now
i
feel
as
if
the
odor
of
cabbage
in
the
hallway
would
seem
like
heaven
arthur
led
the
way
to
the
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
room
let
settle
a
few
of
the
more
important
matters
he
said
in
a
businesslike
tone
none
of
us
has
any
authority
to
act
for
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
tower
but
so
many
of
us
are
in
a
state
of
blue
funk
that
those
who
are
here
must
have
charge
for
a
while
anybody
any
suggestions
housing
answered
van
deventer
promptly
i
suggest
that
we
draft
a
gang
of
men
to
haul
all
the
upholstered
settees
and
rugs
that
are
to
be
found
to
one
floor
for
the
women
to
sleep
on
m
yes
that
a
good
idea
anybody
a
better
plan
no
one
spoke
they
all
still
looked
much
too
homesick
to
take
any
great
interest
in
anything
but
they
began
to
listen
more
or
less
i
been
thinking
about
coal
said
arthur
there
undoubtedly
a
supply
in
the
basement
but
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
well
to
cut
the
lights
off
most
of
the
floors
only
lighting
up
the
ones
we
using
that
might
be
a
good
idea
later
estelle
said
quietly
but
light
is
cheering
somehow
and
every
one
feels
so
blue
that
i
do
it
they
begin
to
get
up
their
resolution
again
and
you
can
ask
them
to
do
things
if
we
going
to
starve
to
death
one
of
the
other
men
said
gloomily
we
might
as
well
have
plenty
of
light
to
do
it
by
we
are
going
to
starve
to
death
retorted
arthur
sharply
just
before
i
came
down
i
saw
a
great
cloud
of
birds
greater
than
i
had
ever
seen
before
when
we
get
at
those
birds
when
echoed
the
gloomy
one
they
were
pigeons
estelle
explained
they
should
be
hard
to
snare
or
trap
i
usually
have
my
dinner
before
now
the
gloomy
one
protested
and
i
told
i
wo
get
anything
the
other
men
began
to
straighten
their
shoulders
the
peevishness
of
one
of
their
number
seemed
to
bring
out
their
latent
courage
well
we
got
to
stand
it
for
the
present
one
of
them
said
almost
philosophically
what
i
most
anxious
about
is
getting
back
have
we
any
chance
arthur
nodded
emphatically
i
think
so
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
as
to
the
cause
of
our
sinking
into
the
fourth
dimension
and
when
that
is
verified
a
corrective
can
be
looked
for
and
applied
how
long
will
that
take
ca
say
arthur
replied
frankly
i
do
know
what
tools
what
materials
or
what
workmen
we
have
and
what
rather
more
to
the
point
i
do
even
know
what
work
will
have
to
be
done
the
pressing
problem
is
food
oh
bother
the
food
some
one
protested
impatiently
i
care
about
myself
i
can
go
hungry
i
want
to
get
back
to
my
family
that
all
that
really
matters
a
chorus
of
voices
echoed
we
better
not
bother
about
anything
else
unless
we
find
we
ca
get
back
concentrate
on
getting
back
one
man
stated
more
explicitly
look
here
said
arthur
incisively
you
a
family
and
so
have
a
great
many
of
the
others
in
the
tower
but
your
family
and
everybody
else
family
has
got
to
wait
as
an
inside
limit
we
can
hope
to
begin
to
work
on
the
problem
of
getting
back
when
we
sure
nothing
else
going
to
happen
i
tell
you
quite
honestly
that
i
think
i
know
what
is
the
direct
cause
of
this
catastrophe
and
i
tell
you
even
more
honestly
that
i
think
i
the
only
man
among
us
who
can
put
this
tower
back
where
it
started
from
and
i
tell
you
most
honestly
of
all
that
any
attempt
to
meddle
at
this
present
time
with
the
forces
that
let
us
down
here
will
result
in
a
catastrophe
considerably
greater
than
the
one
that
happened
well
if
you
sure
some
one
began
reluctantly
i
am
so
sure
that
i
going
to
keep
to
myself
the
knowledge
of
what
will
start
those
forces
to
work
again
arthur
said
quietly
i
do
want
any
impatient
meddling
if
we
start
them
too
soon
god
only
knows
what
will
happen
viii
van
deventer
was
eying
arthur
chamberlain
keenly
it
is
a
question
of
your
wanting
pay
in
exchange
for
your
services
in
putting
us
back
is
it
he
asked
coolly
arthur
turned
and
faced
him
his
face
began
to
flush
slowly
van
deventer
put
up
one
hand
i
beg
your
pardon
i
see
we
are
settling
the
things
we
came
here
for
estelle
interrupted
she
had
noted
the
threat
of
friction
and
hastened
to
put
in
a
diversion
arthur
relaxed
i
think
that
as
a
beginning
he
suggested
we
better
get
sleeping
arrangements
completed
we
can
get
everybody
together
somewhere
i
dare
say
and
then
secure
volunteers
for
the
work
right
van
deventer
was
anxious
to
make
amends
for
his
blunder
of
a
moment
before
shall
i
send
the
bank
watchmen
to
go
on
each
floor
in
turn
and
ask
everybody
to
come
you
might
start
them
arthur
said
it
will
take
a
long
time
for
every
one
to
assemble
van
deventer
spoke
into
the
telephone
on
his
desk
in
a
moment
he
hung
up
the
receiver
they
on
their
way
he
said
arthur
was
frowning
to
himself
and
scribbling
in
a
of
course
he
announced
abstractedly
the
pressing
problem
is
food
we
quite
a
number
of
fishermen
and
a
few
hunters
we
got
to
have
a
lot
of
food
at
once
and
everything
considered
i
think
we
better
count
on
the
fishermen
at
sunrise
we
better
have
some
people
begin
to
dig
bait
and
wake
our
anglers
better
make
their
tackle
do
you
think
there
was
a
general
nod
we
announce
that
then
the
fishermen
will
go
to
the
river
under
guard
of
the
men
we
have
who
can
shoot
i
think
what
indians
there
are
will
be
much
too
frightened
to
try
to
ambush
any
of
us
but
better
be
on
the
safe
side
they
keep
together
and
fish
at
nearly
the
same
spot
with
our
hunters
patrolling
the
woods
behind
them
taking
at
game
if
they
see
any
the
fishermen
should
make
more
or
less
of
a
success
i
think
the
indians
were
extensive
fishers
that
i
ever
heard
of
and
the
river
ought
fairly
to
swarm
with
fish
he
closed
his
how
many
weapons
can
we
count
on
altogether
arthur
asked
van
deventer
in
the
bank
about
a
dozen
and
half
a
dozen
repeating
rifles
elsewhere
i
do
know
forty
or
fifty
men
said
they
had
revolvers
though
we
give
revolvers
to
the
men
who
go
with
the
fishermen
the
indians
have
heard
firearms
and
will
run
at
the
report
even
if
they
dare
attack
our
men
we
can
send
out
the
men
as
hunters
some
one
suggested
and
send
gardeners
with
them
to
look
for
vegetables
and
such
things
we
have
to
take
a
sort
of
census
really
arthur
suggested
finding
what
every
one
can
do
and
getting
him
to
do
it
i
never
planned
anything
like
this
before
van
deventer
remarked
and
i
never
thought
i
should
but
this
is
much
more
fun
than
running
a
bank
arthur
smiled
let
go
and
have
our
meeting
he
said
cheerfully
but
the
meeting
was
a
gloomy
and
despairing
affair
nearly
every
one
had
watched
the
sun
set
upon
a
strange
wild
landscape
hardly
an
individual
among
the
whole
two
thousand
of
them
had
ever
been
out
of
sight
of
a
house
before
in
his
or
her
life
to
look
out
at
a
vast
untouched
wilderness
where
hitherto
they
had
seen
the
most
highly
civilized
city
on
the
globe
would
have
been
startling
and
depressing
enough
in
itself
but
to
know
that
they
were
alone
in
a
whole
continent
of
savages
and
that
there
was
not
indeed
in
all
the
world
a
single
community
of
people
they
could
greet
as
brothers
was
terrifying
few
of
them
thought
so
far
but
there
was
actually
if
estimate
of
several
thousand
years
drop
back
through
time
was
correct
there
was
actually
no
other
group
of
people
in
the
world
the
english
language
was
yet
to
be
invented
even
rome
the
synonym
for
antiquity
of
culture
might
still
be
an
obscure
village
inhabited
by
a
band
of
tatterdemalions
under
the
leadership
of
an
upstart
romulus
soft
in
body
as
these
people
were
and
unaccustomed
to
face
other
than
the
most
conventionalized
emergencies
of
life
they
were
terrified
hardly
one
of
them
had
even
gone
without
a
meal
in
all
his
life
to
have
the
prospect
of
having
to
earn
their
food
not
by
the
manipulation
of
figures
in
a
book
or
by
expert
juggling
of
profits
and
prices
but
by
literal
wresting
of
that
food
from
its
source
in
the
earth
or
stream
was
a
really
terrifying
thing
for
them
in
addition
every
one
of
them
was
bound
to
the
life
of
modern
times
by
a
hundred
ties
many
of
them
had
families
a
thousand
years
away
all
had
interests
engrossing
interests
in
modern
new
york
one
young
man
felt
an
anxiety
that
was
really
ludicrous
because
he
had
promised
to
take
his
sweetheart
to
the
theater
that
night
and
if
he
did
not
come
she
would
be
very
angry
another
was
to
have
been
married
in
a
week
some
of
the
people
were
like
van
deventer
and
arthur
so
situated
that
they
could
view
the
episode
as
an
adventure
or
like
estelle
who
had
no
immediate
fear
because
all
her
family
was
provided
for
without
her
help
and
lived
far
from
new
york
so
they
would
not
learn
of
the
catastrophe
for
some
time
many
however
felt
instant
and
pressing
fear
for
the
families
whose
expenses
ran
always
so
close
to
their
incomes
that
the
disappearance
of
the
breadwinner
for
a
week
would
mean
actual
want
or
debt
there
are
very
many
such
families
in
new
york
the
people
therefore
that
gathered
hopelessly
at
the
call
of
van
deventer
watchmen
were
dazed
and
spiritless
their
excitement
after
arthur
first
attempt
to
explain
the
situation
to
them
had
evaporated
they
were
no
longer
keyed
up
to
a
high
pitch
by
the
startling
thing
that
had
happened
to
them
nevertheless
although
only
half
comprehending
what
had
actually
occurred
they
began
to
realize
what
that
occurrence
meant
no
matter
where
they
might
go
over
the
whole
face
of
the
globe
they
would
always
be
aliens
and
strangers
if
they
had
been
carried
away
to
some
unknown
shore
some
wilderness
far
from
their
own
land
they
might
have
thought
of
building
ships
to
return
to
their
homes
they
had
seen
new
york
vanish
before
their
eyes
however
they
had
seen
their
civilization
disappear
while
they
watched
they
were
in
a
barbarous
world
there
was
not
for
example
a
single
sulfur
match
on
the
whole
earth
except
those
in
the
runaway
skyscraper
ix
arthur
and
van
deventer
in
turn
with
the
others
of
the
cooler
heads
thundered
at
the
apathetic
people
trying
to
waken
them
to
the
necessity
for
work
they
showered
promises
of
inevitable
return
to
modern
times
they
pledged
their
honor
to
the
belief
that
a
way
would
ultimately
be
found
by
which
they
would
all
yet
find
themselves
safely
back
home
again
the
people
however
had
seen
new
york
disintegrate
and
explanation
sounded
like
some
wild
dream
of
an
imaginative
novelist
not
one
person
in
all
the
gathering
could
actually
realize
that
his
home
might
yet
be
waiting
for
him
though
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
pathetic
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
its
inmates
every
one
was
in
a
turmoil
of
contradictory
beliefs
on
the
one
hand
they
knew
that
all
of
new
york
could
not
be
actually
destroyed
and
replaced
by
a
splendid
forest
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
so
the
accident
or
catastrophe
must
have
occurred
to
those
in
the
tower
and
on
the
other
hand
they
had
seen
all
of
new
york
vanish
by
bits
and
fragments
to
be
replaced
by
a
smaller
and
dingier
town
had
beheld
that
replaced
in
turn
and
at
last
had
landed
in
the
midst
of
this
forest
every
one
too
began
to
feel
am
unusual
and
uncomfortable
sensation
of
hunger
it
was
a
mild
discomfort
as
yet
but
few
of
them
had
experienced
it
before
without
an
immediate
prospect
of
assuaging
the
craving
and
the
knowledge
that
there
was
no
food
to
be
had
somehow
increased
the
desire
for
it
they
were
really
in
a
pitiful
state
van
deventer
spoke
encouragingly
and
then
asked
for
volunteers
for
immediate
work
there
was
hardly
any
response
every
one
seemed
sunk
in
despondency
arthur
then
began
to
talk
straight
from
the
shoulder
and
succeeded
in
rousing
them
a
little
but
every
one
was
still
rather
too
frightened
to
realize
that
work
could
help
at
all
in
desperation
the
dozen
or
so
men
who
had
gathered
in
van
office
went
about
among
the
gathering
and
simply
selected
men
at
random
ordering
them
to
follow
and
begin
work
this
began
to
awaken
the
crowd
but
they
wakened
to
fear
rather
than
resolution
they
were
and
unaccustomed
to
face
the
unusual
or
the
alarming
arthur
noted
the
new
restlessness
but
attributed
it
to
growing
uneasiness
rather
than
selfish
panic
he
was
rather
pleased
that
they
were
outgrowing
their
apathy
when
the
meeting
had
come
to
an
end
he
felt
satisfied
that
by
morning
the
latent
resolution
among
the
people
would
have
crystallized
and
they
would
be
ready
to
work
earnestly
and
intelligently
on
whatever
tasks
they
were
directed
to
undertake
he
returned
to
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
feeling
much
more
hopeful
than
before
two
thousand
people
all
earnestly
working
for
one
end
are
hard
to
down
even
when
faced
with
such
a
task
as
confronted
the
inhabitants
of
the
runaway
skyscraper
even
if
they
were
never
able
to
return
to
modern
times
they
would
still
be
able
to
form
a
community
that
might
do
much
to
hasten
the
development
of
civilization
in
other
parts
of
the
world
his
hope
received
a
rude
shock
when
he
reached
the
great
hallway
on
the
lower
floor
there
was
a
fruit
and
confectionery
stand
here
and
as
arthur
arrived
at
the
spot
he
saw
a
surging
mass
of
men
about
it
the
keeper
of
the
stand
looked
frightened
but
was
selling
off
his
stock
as
fast
as
he
could
make
change
arthur
forced
his
way
to
the
counter
here
he
said
sharply
to
the
keeper
of
the
stand
stop
selling
this
stuff
it
got
to
be
held
until
we
can
dole
it
out
where
it
needed
i
i
ca
help
myself
the
keeper
said
they
it
anyway
get
back
there
arthur
cried
to
the
crowd
do
you
call
this
decent
trying
to
get
more
than
your
share
of
this
stuff
you
get
your
portion
it
is
going
to
be
divided
up
go
to
hell
some
one
panted
you
starve
if
you
want
to
but
i
goin
to
look
out
myself
the
men
were
not
really
starving
but
had
been
put
into
a
panic
by
the
plain
speeches
of
arthur
and
his
helpers
and
were
seizing
what
edibles
they
could
lay
hands
upon
in
preparation
for
the
hunger
they
had
been
warned
to
expect
arthur
pushed
against
the
mob
trying
to
thrust
them
away
from
the
counter
but
his
very
effort
intensified
their
panic
there
was
a
quick
surge
and
a
crash
the
glass
front
of
the
showcase
broke
in
in
a
flash
of
rage
arthur
struck
out
viciously
the
crowd
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
him
however
every
man
was
too
and
too
intent
on
getting
some
of
this
food
before
it
was
all
gone
to
bother
with
him
arthur
was
simply
crushed
back
by
the
bodies
of
the
forty
or
fifty
men
in
a
moment
he
found
himself
alone
amid
the
wreckage
of
the
stand
with
the
keeper
wringing
his
hands
over
the
remnants
of
his
goods
van
deventer
ran
down
the
stairs
what
the
matter
he
demanded
as
he
saw
arthur
nursing
a
bleeding
hand
cut
on
the
broken
glass
of
the
showcase
bolsheviki
answered
arthur
with
a
grim
smile
we
woke
up
some
of
the
crowd
too
successfully
they
got
and
started
to
buy
out
this
stuff
here
i
tried
to
stop
them
and
you
see
what
happened
we
better
look
to
the
restaurant
though
i
doubt
if
they
try
anything
else
just
now
he
followed
van
deventer
up
to
the
restaurant
floor
there
were
picked
men
before
the
door
but
just
as
arthur
and
the
bank
president
appeared
two
or
three
men
went
up
to
the
guards
and
started
conversations
arthur
reached
the
spot
in
time
to
forestall
bribery
arthur
collared
one
man
van
deventer
another
and
in
a
moment
the
two
were
sent
reeling
down
the
hallway
some
fools
have
got
van
deventer
explained
to
the
men
before
the
doors
in
a
casual
voice
though
he
was
breathing
heavily
from
the
unaccustomed
exertion
they
smashed
up
the
on
the
ground
floor
and
stolen
the
contents
it
nothing
but
blue
funk
only
if
any
of
them
start
to
gather
around
here
hit
them
first
and
talk
it
over
afterward
you
do
that
we
will
the
men
said
heartily
shall
we
use
our
guns
asked
another
hopefully
van
deventer
grinned
no
he
replied
we
have
any
excuse
for
that
yet
but
you
might
shoot
at
the
ceiling
if
they
get
excited
they
just
frightened
he
took
arthur
arm
and
the
two
walked
toward
the
stairway
again
chamberlain
he
said
happily
tell
me
why
i
never
had
as
much
fun
as
this
before
arthur
smiled
a
bit
wearily
i
glad
you
enjoying
yourself
he
said
i
not
i
going
outside
and
walk
around
i
want
to
see
if
any
cracks
have
appeared
in
the
earth
anywhere
it
dark
and
i
borrow
a
lantern
down
in
the
but
i
want
to
find
out
if
there
are
any
more
developments
in
the
condition
of
the
building
x
despite
his
preoccupation
with
his
errand
which
was
to
find
if
there
were
other
signs
of
the
continued
activity
of
the
strange
forces
that
had
lowered
the
tower
through
the
fourth
dimension
into
the
dim
and
unrecorded
years
of
aboriginal
america
arthur
could
not
escape
the
fascination
of
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
a
bright
moon
shone
overhead
and
silvered
the
white
sides
of
the
tower
while
the
windows
of
the
offices
within
glittered
like
jewels
set
into
the
shining
shaft
from
his
position
on
the
ground
he
looked
into
the
dimness
of
the
forest
on
all
sides
black
obscurity
had
gathered
beneath
the
dark
masses
of
moonlit
foliage
the
tiny
teepees
of
the
now
deserted
indian
village
glowed
palely
above
the
stars
looked
calmly
down
at
the
accusing
finger
of
the
tower
pointing
upward
as
if
in
reproach
at
their
indifference
to
the
savagery
that
reigned
over
the
whole
earth
like
a
fairy
tower
of
jewels
the
building
rose
alone
among
a
wilderness
of
trees
and
streams
it
towered
in
a
strange
beauty
moonlit
to
silver
lighted
from
within
to
a
mass
of
brilliant
gems
it
stood
serenely
still
arthur
carrying
his
futile
lantern
about
its
base
felt
his
own
insignificance
as
never
before
he
wondered
what
the
indians
must
think
he
knew
there
must
be
hundreds
of
eyes
fixed
upon
the
strange
sight
fixed
in
terror
or
superstitious
reverence
upon
this
unearthly
visitor
to
their
hunting
grounds
a
tiny
figure
dwarfed
by
the
building
whose
base
he
skirted
arthur
moved
slowly
about
the
vast
pile
the
earth
seemed
not
to
have
been
affected
by
the
vast
weight
of
the
tower
arthur
knew
however
that
long
concrete
piles
reached
far
down
to
bedrock
it
was
these
piles
that
had
sunk
into
the
fourth
dimension
carrying
the
building
with
them
arthur
had
followed
the
plans
with
great
interest
when
the
metropolitan
was
constructed
it
was
an
engineering
feat
and
in
the
engineering
periodicals
whose
study
was
a
part
of
business
great
space
had
been
given
to
the
building
and
the
methods
of
its
construction
while
examining
the
earth
carefully
he
went
over
his
theory
of
the
cause
for
the
catastrophe
the
whole
structure
must
have
sunk
at
the
same
time
or
it
too
would
have
disintegrated
as
the
other
buildings
had
appeared
to
disintegrate
mentally
arthur
likened
the
submergence
of
the
tower
in
the
oceans
of
time
to
an
elevator
sinking
past
the
different
floors
of
an
office
building
all
about
the
building
the
other
of
new
york
had
seemed
to
vanish
in
an
elevator
the
floors
one
passes
seem
to
rise
upward
carrying
out
the
analogy
to
its
logical
end
arthur
reasoned
that
the
building
itself
had
no
more
cause
to
disintegrate
as
the
buildings
it
passed
seemed
to
disintegrate
than
the
elevator
in
the
office
building
would
have
cause
to
rise
because
its
surroundings
seemed
to
rise
within
the
building
he
knew
there
were
strange
stirrings
of
emotions
queer
currents
of
panic
were
running
about
throwing
the
people
to
and
fro
as
leaves
are
thrown
about
by
a
current
of
wind
yet
underneath
all
those
undercurrents
of
fear
was
a
rapidly
growing
resolution
strengthened
by
an
increasing
knowledge
of
the
need
to
work
men
were
busy
even
then
shifting
all
possible
comfortable
furniture
to
a
single
story
for
the
women
in
the
building
to
occupy
the
men
would
sleep
on
the
floor
for
the
present
beds
of
boughs
could
be
improvised
on
the
morrow
at
sunrise
on
the
following
morning
many
men
would
go
to
the
streams
to
fish
guarded
by
other
men
all
would
be
frightened
no
doubt
but
there
would
be
a
grim
resolution
underneath
the
fear
other
men
would
wander
about
to
hunt
there
was
little
likelihood
of
indians
approaching
for
some
days
at
least
but
when
they
did
come
arthur
meant
to
avoid
hostilities
by
all
possible
means
the
indians
would
be
fearful
of
their
strange
visitors
and
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
convince
them
that
friendliness
was
safest
even
if
they
displayed
unfriendly
desires
the
pressing
problem
was
food
there
were
two
thousand
people
in
the
building
and
they
were
unaccustomed
to
hardship
and
could
not
endure
what
more
primitive
people
would
hardly
have
noticed
they
must
be
fed
but
first
they
must
be
taught
to
feed
themselves
the
fishermen
would
help
but
arthur
could
only
hope
that
they
would
prove
equal
to
the
occasion
he
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
them
from
the
hunters
he
expected
but
little
the
indians
were
wary
hunters
and
game
would
be
shy
if
not
scarce
the
great
cloud
of
birds
he
had
seen
at
sunset
was
a
hopeful
sign
arthur
vaguely
remembered
stories
of
great
flocks
of
which
had
been
exterminated
as
the
buffalo
was
exterminated
as
he
considered
the
remembrance
became
more
clear
they
had
flown
in
huge
flocks
which
nearly
darkened
the
sky
as
late
as
the
forties
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
had
been
an
important
article
of
food
and
had
glutted
the
market
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
estelle
had
said
the
birds
he
had
seen
at
sunset
were
pigeons
perhaps
this
was
one
of
the
great
flocks
if
it
were
really
so
the
food
problem
would
be
much
lessened
provided
a
way
could
be
found
to
secure
them
the
ammunition
in
the
tower
was
very
limited
and
a
shell
could
not
be
found
for
every
bird
that
was
needed
nor
even
for
every
three
or
four
great
traps
must
be
devised
or
might
possibly
be
produced
arthur
made
a
mental
note
to
ask
estelle
if
she
knew
anything
of
a
vague
humming
roar
altering
in
pitch
came
to
his
ears
he
listened
for
some
time
before
he
identified
it
as
the
sound
of
the
wind
playing
upon
the
irregular
surfaces
of
the
tower
in
the
city
the
sound
was
drowned
by
the
multitude
of
other
noises
but
here
arthur
could
hear
it
plainly
he
listened
a
moment
and
became
surprised
at
the
number
of
night
noises
he
could
hear
in
new
york
he
had
closed
his
ears
to
incidental
sounds
from
sheer
somewhere
he
heard
the
ripple
of
a
little
spring
as
the
idea
of
a
spring
came
into
his
mind
he
remembered
estelle
description
of
the
roar
she
had
heard
he
put
his
hand
on
the
cold
stone
of
the
building
there
was
still
a
vibrant
quivering
of
the
rock
it
was
weaker
than
before
but
was
still
noticeable
he
drew
back
from
the
rock
and
looked
up
into
the
sky
it
seemed
to
blaze
with
stars
far
more
stars
than
arthur
had
ever
seen
in
the
city
and
more
than
he
had
dreamed
existed
as
he
looked
however
a
cloud
seemed
to
film
a
portion
of
the
heavens
the
stars
still
showed
through
it
but
they
twinkled
in
a
peculiar
fashion
that
arthur
could
not
understand
he
watched
in
growing
perplexity
the
cloud
moved
very
swiftly
thin
as
it
seemed
to
be
it
should
have
been
silvery
from
the
moonlight
but
the
sky
was
noticeably
darker
where
it
moved
it
advanced
toward
the
tower
and
seemed
to
obscure
the
upper
portion
a
confused
motion
became
visible
among
its
parts
wisps
of
it
whirled
away
from
the
brilliantly
lighted
tower
and
then
returned
swiftly
toward
it
arthur
heard
a
faint
tinkle
then
a
musical
scraping
which
became
louder
a
faint
scream
sounded
then
another
the
tinkle
developed
into
the
sound
made
by
breaking
glass
and
the
scraping
sound
became
that
of
the
broken
fragments
as
they
rubbed
against
the
sides
of
the
tower
in
their
fall
the
scream
came
again
it
was
the
frightened
cry
of
a
woman
a
soft
body
struck
the
earth
not
ten
feet
from
where
arthur
stood
then
another
and
another
xi
arthur
urged
the
elevator
boy
to
greater
speed
they
were
speeding
up
the
shaft
as
rapidly
as
possible
but
it
was
not
fast
enough
when
they
at
last
reached
the
height
at
which
the
excitement
seemed
to
be
centered
the
car
was
stopped
with
a
jerk
and
arthur
dashed
down
the
hall
half
a
dozen
frightened
stenographers
stood
there
huddled
together
what
the
matter
arthur
demanded
men
were
running
from
the
other
floors
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
the
the
windows
broke
and
and
something
flew
in
at
us
one
of
them
gasped
there
was
a
crash
inside
the
nearest
office
and
the
women
screamed
again
arthur
drew
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
advanced
to
the
door
he
quickly
threw
it
open
entered
and
closed
it
behind
him
those
left
out
in
the
hall
waited
tensely
there
was
no
sound
the
women
began
to
look
even
more
frightened
the
men
shuffled
their
feet
uneasily
and
looked
uncomfortably
at
one
another
van
deventer
appeared
on
the
scene
puffing
a
little
from
his
haste
the
door
opened
again
and
arthur
came
out
he
was
carrying
something
in
his
hands
he
had
put
his
revolver
aside
and
looked
somewhat
foolish
but
very
much
delighted
the
food
question
is
settled
he
said
happily
look
he
held
out
the
object
he
carried
it
was
a
bird
apparently
a
pigeon
of
some
sort
it
seemed
to
have
been
stunned
but
as
arthur
held
it
out
it
stirred
then
struggled
and
in
a
moment
was
flapping
wildly
in
an
attempt
to
escape
it
a
said
arthur
they
must
fly
after
dark
sometimes
a
big
flock
of
them
ran
afoul
of
the
tower
and
were
dazed
by
the
lights
they
broken
a
lot
of
windows
i
dare
say
but
a
great
many
of
them
ran
into
the
stonework
and
were
stunned
i
was
outside
the
tower
and
when
i
came
in
they
were
dropping
to
the
ground
by
hundreds
i
did
know
what
they
were
then
but
if
we
wait
twenty
minutes
or
so
i
think
we
can
go
out
and
gather
up
our
supper
and
breakfast
and
several
other
meals
all
at
once
estelle
had
appeared
and
now
reached
out
her
hands
for
the
bird
i
take
care
of
this
one
she
said
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
see
if
there
are
some
more
stunned
in
the
other
offices
in
half
an
hour
the
electric
stoves
of
the
restaurant
were
going
at
their
full
capacity
men
cheerfully
excited
men
now
were
bringing
in
pigeons
by
armfuls
and
other
men
were
skinning
them
there
was
no
time
to
pluck
them
though
a
great
many
of
the
women
were
busily
engaged
in
that
occupation
as
fast
as
the
birds
could
be
cooked
they
were
served
out
to
the
impatient
but
much
cheered
castaways
and
in
a
little
while
nearly
every
person
in
the
place
was
walking
casually
about
the
halls
with
a
roasted
broiled
or
fried
pigeon
in
his
hands
the
ovens
were
roasting
pigeons
the
were
frying
them
and
the
broilers
were
loaded
down
with
the
small
but
tender
birds
the
unexpected
solution
of
the
most
pressing
question
cheered
every
one
amazingly
many
people
were
still
frightened
but
less
frightened
than
before
worry
for
their
families
still
oppressed
a
great
many
but
the
removal
of
the
fear
of
immediate
hunger
led
them
to
believe
that
the
other
problems
before
them
would
be
solved
too
and
in
as
satisfactory
a
manner
arthur
had
returned
to
his
office
with
four
broiled
pigeons
in
a
sheet
of
as
he
somehow
expected
estelle
was
waiting
there
thought
i
bring
lunch
up
he
announced
are
you
hungry
starving
estelle
replied
and
laughed
the
whole
catastrophe
began
to
become
an
adventure
she
bit
eagerly
into
a
bird
arthur
began
as
hungrily
on
another
for
some
time
neither
spoke
a
word
at
last
however
arthur
waved
the
leg
of
his
second
pigeon
toward
his
desk
look
what
we
got
here
he
said
estelle
nodded
the
stunned
pigeon
arthur
had
first
picked
up
was
tied
by
one
foot
to
a
i
thought
we
might
keep
him
for
a
souvenir
she
suggested
you
seem
pretty
confident
we
get
back
all
right
arthur
observed
it
was
surely
lucky
those
blessed
birds
came
along
they
heartened
up
the
people
wonderfully
oh
i
knew
you
manage
somehow
said
estelle
confidently
i
manage
arthur
repeated
smiling
what
have
i
done
why
you
done
everything
affirmed
estelle
stoutly
told
the
people
what
to
do
from
the
very
first
and
you
going
to
get
us
back
arthur
grinned
then
suddenly
his
face
grew
a
little
more
serious
i
wish
i
were
as
sure
as
you
are
he
said
i
think
we
be
all
right
though
sooner
or
later
i
sure
of
it
estelle
declared
with
conviction
why
you
why
i
asked
arthur
again
he
bent
forward
in
his
chair
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
estelle
she
looked
up
met
his
gaze
and
stammered
you
you
do
things
she
finished
lamely
i
tempted
to
do
something
now
arthur
said
look
here
miss
woodward
you
been
in
my
employ
for
three
or
four
months
in
all
that
time
i
never
had
anything
but
the
most
impersonal
comments
from
you
why
the
sudden
change
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
robbed
his
words
of
any
impertinence
why
i
really
i
really
suppose
i
never
noticed
you
before
said
estelle
please
notice
me
hereafter
said
arthur
i
have
been
noticing
you
i
been
doing
practically
nothing
else
estelle
flushed
again
she
tried
to
meet
arthur
eyes
and
failed
she
bit
desperately
into
her
pigeon
drumstick
trying
to
think
of
something
to
say
when
we
get
back
went
on
arthur
meditatively
i
have
nothing
to
do
no
work
or
anything
i
be
broke
and
out
of
a
job
estelle
shook
her
head
emphatically
arthur
paid
no
attention
estelle
he
said
smiling
would
you
like
to
be
out
of
a
job
with
me
estelle
turned
crimson
i
not
very
successful
arthur
went
on
soberly
i
afraid
i
would
make
a
very
good
husband
i
rather
worthless
and
lazy
you
are
broke
in
estelle
you
you
arthur
reached
over
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
what
he
demanded
she
would
not
look
at
him
but
she
did
not
draw
away
he
held
her
from
him
for
a
moment
what
am
i
he
demanded
again
somehow
he
found
himself
kissing
the
tips
of
her
ears
her
face
was
buried
against
his
shoulder
what
am
i
he
repeated
sternly
her
voice
was
muffled
by
his
coat
you
you
dear
she
said
there
was
an
interlude
of
about
a
minute
and
a
half
then
she
pushed
him
away
from
her
do
she
said
breathlessly
please
do
are
you
going
to
marry
me
he
demanded
still
crimson
she
nodded
shyly
he
kissed
her
again
please
do
she
protested
she
fondled
the
lapels
of
his
coat
quite
content
to
have
his
arms
about
her
why
may
i
kiss
you
if
you
going
to
marry
me
arthur
demanded
she
looked
up
at
him
with
an
air
of
demure
primness
you
you
been
eating
pigeon
she
told
him
in
mock
gravity
and
and
your
mouth
is
greasy
xii
it
was
two
weeks
later
estelle
looked
out
over
the
now
familiar
wild
landscape
it
was
much
the
same
when
she
looked
far
away
but
near
by
there
were
great
changes
a
cleared
trail
led
through
the
woods
to
the
waterfront
and
a
raft
of
logs
extended
out
into
the
river
for
hundreds
of
feet
both
sides
of
the
raft
were
lined
with
busy
fishermen
men
and
women
too
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
base
of
the
building
a
huge
mound
of
earth
smoked
sullenly
the
coal
in
the
cellar
had
given
out
and
charcoal
had
been
found
to
be
the
best
substitute
they
could
improvise
the
mound
was
where
the
charcoal
was
made
it
was
work
to
keep
the
fires
going
with
charcoal
because
it
burned
so
rapidly
in
the
powerful
draft
of
the
furnaces
but
the
original
gang
had
been
recruited
to
several
times
its
original
number
from
among
the
towerites
and
the
work
was
divided
until
it
did
not
seem
hard
as
estelle
looked
down
two
tiny
figures
sauntered
across
the
clearing
from
the
woods
with
a
heavy
animal
slung
between
them
one
of
them
was
using
a
gun
as
a
estelle
saw
the
flash
of
the
sun
on
its
polished
metal
barrel
there
were
a
number
of
indians
in
the
clearing
watching
with
eyes
the
activities
of
the
whites
dozens
of
canoes
dotted
the
hudson
each
with
its
load
of
fishermen
industriously
working
for
the
white
people
it
had
been
hard
to
overcome
the
fear
in
the
indians
and
they
still
paid
superstitious
reverence
to
the
whites
but
fair
dealings
coupled
with
a
constant
readiness
to
defend
themselves
had
enabled
arthur
to
institute
a
system
of
trading
for
food
that
had
so
far
proved
satisfactory
the
whites
had
found
spare
bulbs
valuable
currency
in
dealing
with
the
redmen
too
was
highly
prized
there
was
not
a
picture
left
hanging
in
any
of
the
offices
metal
bought
huge
quantities
of
provisions
from
the
eager
indian
traders
and
the
story
was
current
in
the
tower
that
arthur
had
received
eight
of
corn
and
vegetables
in
exchange
for
a
typewriter
no
one
could
guess
what
the
savages
wanted
with
the
typewriter
but
they
had
carted
it
away
triumphantly
estelle
smiled
tenderly
to
herself
as
she
remembered
how
arthur
had
been
the
leading
spirit
in
all
the
numberless
enterprises
in
which
the
castaways
had
been
forced
to
engage
he
would
come
to
her
in
a
spare
ten
minutes
and
tell
her
how
everything
was
going
he
seemed
curiously
boylike
in
those
moments
sometimes
he
would
come
straight
from
the
he
insisted
on
taking
part
in
all
the
more
arduous
duties
having
hastily
cleaned
himself
for
her
inspection
snatch
a
hurried
kiss
and
then
go
off
laughing
to
help
chop
down
trees
for
the
long
he
had
told
them
how
to
make
charcoal
had
taken
a
leading
part
in
establishing
and
maintaining
friendly
relations
with
the
indians
and
was
now
down
in
the
deepest
working
with
a
gang
of
volunteers
to
try
to
put
the
building
back
where
it
belonged
estelle
had
said
after
the
collapse
of
the
flooring
in
the
that
she
heard
a
sound
like
the
rushing
of
waters
arthur
on
examining
the
floor
where
the
vault
stood
found
it
had
risen
an
inch
on
these
facts
he
had
built
up
his
theory
the
building
like
all
modern
rested
on
concrete
piles
extending
down
to
bedrock
in
the
center
of
one
of
those
piles
there
was
a
hollow
tube
originally
intended
to
serve
as
an
artesian
well
the
flow
had
been
insufficient
and
the
well
had
been
stopped
up
arthur
of
course
as
an
engineer
had
studied
the
construction
of
the
building
with
great
care
and
happened
to
remember
that
this
partly
hollow
pile
was
the
one
nearest
the
vault
the
collapse
of
the
floor
had
suggested
that
some
change
had
happened
in
the
building
itself
and
that
was
found
when
he
saw
that
the
had
actually
risen
an
inch
he
at
once
connected
the
rise
in
the
flooring
above
the
hollow
pile
with
the
pipe
in
the
pile
estelle
had
heard
liquid
sounds
evidently
water
had
been
forced
into
the
hollow
artesian
pipe
under
an
unthinkable
pressure
when
the
catastrophe
occurred
from
the
rumbling
and
the
suddenness
of
the
whole
catastrophe
a
volcanic
or
seismic
disturbance
was
evident
the
connection
of
volcanic
or
seismic
action
with
a
flow
of
water
suggested
a
geyser
or
a
hot
spring
of
some
sort
probably
a
spring
which
had
broken
through
its
normal
confines
some
time
before
but
whose
pressure
had
been
sufficient
to
prevent
the
accident
until
the
failure
of
its
flow
when
the
flow
ceased
the
building
sank
rapidly
for
the
fact
that
this
sinking
was
in
the
fourth
direction
the
fourth
dimension
arthur
had
no
explanation
he
simply
knew
that
in
some
mysterious
way
an
outlet
for
the
pressure
had
developed
in
that
fashion
and
that
the
tower
had
followed
the
spring
in
its
fall
through
time
the
sole
apparent
change
in
the
building
had
occurred
above
the
one
hollow
concrete
pile
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
if
access
were
to
be
had
to
the
mysterious
and
so
far
only
assumed
spring
it
must
be
through
that
pile
while
the
vault
retained
its
abnormal
elevation
arthur
believed
that
there
was
still
water
at
an
immense
and
incalculable
pressure
in
the
pipe
he
dared
not
attempt
to
tap
the
pipe
until
the
pressure
had
abated
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
found
the
vault
slowly
settling
back
into
place
when
its
return
to
the
normal
was
complete
he
dared
begin
boring
a
hole
to
reach
the
hollow
tube
in
the
concrete
pile
as
he
suspected
he
found
water
in
the
pile
water
whose
sulfurous
and
mineral
nature
confirmed
his
belief
that
a
geyser
reaching
deep
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
as
well
as
far
back
in
the
realms
of
time
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
extraordinary
jaunt
of
the
tower
geysers
were
still
far
from
satisfactory
things
to
explain
there
are
many
of
their
vagaries
which
we
can
not
understand
at
all
we
do
know
a
few
things
which
affect
them
and
one
thing
is
that
soaping
them
will
stimulate
their
flow
in
an
extraordinary
manner
arthur
proposed
to
soap
this
mysterious
geyser
when
the
renewal
of
its
flow
should
lift
the
runaway
back
to
the
epoch
from
which
the
failure
of
the
flow
had
caused
it
to
fall
he
made
his
preparations
with
great
care
he
confidently
expected
his
plan
to
work
and
to
see
the
once
more
towering
over
new
york
as
was
its
wont
but
he
did
not
allow
the
fishermen
and
hunters
to
relax
their
efforts
on
that
account
they
labored
as
before
while
deep
down
in
the
of
the
colossal
building
arthur
and
his
volunteers
toiled
mightily
they
had
to
bore
through
the
concrete
pile
until
they
reached
the
hollow
within
it
then
when
the
evidence
gained
from
the
water
in
the
pipe
had
confirmed
his
surmises
they
had
to
prepare
their
charge
of
soapy
liquids
by
which
the
geyser
was
to
be
stirred
to
renewed
activity
great
quantities
of
the
soap
used
by
the
scrubwomen
in
scrubbing
down
the
floors
was
boiled
with
water
until
a
sirupy
mess
was
evolved
means
had
then
to
be
provided
by
which
this
could
be
quickly
introduced
into
the
hollow
pile
the
hole
then
closed
and
then
braced
to
withstand
a
pressure
unparalleled
in
hydraulic
science
arthur
believed
that
from
the
hollow
pile
the
soapy
liquid
would
find
its
way
to
the
geyser
proper
where
it
would
take
effect
in
stimulating
the
lessened
flow
to
its
former
proportions
when
that
took
place
he
believed
that
the
building
would
return
as
swiftly
and
as
surely
as
it
had
left
them
to
normal
modern
times
the
telephone
rang
in
his
office
and
estelle
answered
it
arthur
was
on
the
wire
a
signal
was
being
hung
out
for
all
the
castaway
to
return
to
the
building
from
their
several
occupations
they
were
about
to
soap
the
geyser
did
estelle
want
to
come
down
and
watch
she
did
she
stood
in
the
main
hallway
as
the
excited
and
hopeful
people
trooped
in
when
the
last
was
inside
the
doors
were
firmly
closed
the
few
friendly
indians
outside
stared
perplexedly
at
the
mysterious
white
strangers
the
whites
laughing
excitedly
began
to
wave
to
the
indians
their
was
premature
estelle
took
her
way
down
into
the
cellar
arthur
was
awaiting
her
arrival
van
deventer
stood
near
with
the
grinning
grimy
members
of
arthur
volunteer
work
gang
the
massive
concrete
pile
stood
in
the
center
of
the
cellar
a
big
was
coupled
to
a
tiny
pipe
that
led
into
the
heart
of
the
mass
of
concrete
arthur
was
going
to
force
the
soapy
liquid
into
the
hollow
pile
by
steam
at
a
signal
steam
began
to
hiss
in
the
boiler
live
steam
from
the
forced
the
soapy
sirup
out
of
the
boiler
through
the
small
iron
pipe
into
the
hollow
that
led
to
the
geyser
far
underground
six
thousand
gallons
in
all
were
forced
into
the
opening
in
a
space
of
three
minutes
arthur
grimy
gang
began
to
work
with
desperate
haste
quickly
they
withdrew
the
iron
pipe
and
inserted
a
long
steel
plug
painfully
beaten
from
a
bar
of
solid
metal
then
girding
the
colossal
concrete
pile
ring
after
ring
of
metal
was
slipped
on
to
hold
the
plug
in
place
the
last
of
the
safeguards
was
hardly
fastened
firmly
when
estelle
listened
intently
i
hear
a
rumbling
she
said
quietly
arthur
reached
forward
and
put
his
hand
on
the
mass
of
concrete
it
is
quivering
he
reported
as
quietly
i
think
we
be
on
our
way
in
a
very
little
while
the
group
broke
for
the
stairs
to
watch
the
panorama
as
the
runaway
made
its
way
back
through
the
thousands
of
years
to
the
times
that
had
built
it
for
a
monument
to
modern
commerce
arthur
and
estelle
went
high
up
in
the
tower
from
the
window
of
arthur
office
they
looked
eagerly
and
felt
the
slight
quiver
as
the
tower
got
under
way
estelle
looked
up
at
the
sun
and
saw
it
mend
its
pace
toward
the
west
night
fell
the
evening
sounds
became
and
shrill
then
seemed
to
cease
altogether
in
a
very
little
while
there
was
light
again
and
the
sun
was
speeding
across
the
sky
it
sank
hastily
and
returned
almost
immediately
the
east
its
pace
became
a
breakneck
rush
down
behind
the
hills
and
up
in
the
east
down
in
the
west
up
in
the
east
down
and
up
the
flickering
began
the
race
back
toward
modern
times
had
started
arthur
and
estelle
stood
at
the
window
and
looked
out
as
the
sun
rushed
more
and
more
rapidly
across
the
sky
until
it
became
but
a
streak
of
light
shifting
first
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
as
the
seasons
passed
in
their
turn
with
arthur
arms
about
her
shoulders
estelle
stared
out
across
the
unbelievable
landscape
while
the
nights
and
days
the
winters
and
summers
and
the
storms
and
calms
of
a
thousand
years
swept
past
them
into
the
irrevocable
past
presently
arthur
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
while
he
kissed
her
so
swiftly
did
the
days
and
years
flee
by
three
generations
were
born
grew
and
begot
children
and
died
again
estelle
held
fast
in
arthur
arms
thought
nothing
of
such
trivial
things
she
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
while
the
years
passed
them
unheeded
of
course
you
know
that
the
building
landed
safely
in
the
exact
hour
minute
and
second
from
which
it
started
so
that
when
the
frightened
and
excited
people
poured
out
of
it
to
stand
in
madison
square
and
feel
that
the
world
was
once
more
right
side
up
their
hilarious
and
incomprehensible
conduct
made
such
of
the
world
as
was
passing
by
think
a
contagious
madness
had
broken
out
days
passed
before
the
story
of
the
two
thousand
was
believed
but
at
last
it
was
accepted
as
truth
and
eminent
scientists
studied
the
matter
exhaustively
there
has
been
one
rather
queer
result
of
the
journey
of
the
runaway
a
certain
isidore
eckstein
a
dealer
in
jewelry
novelties
whose
office
was
in
the
tower
when
it
disappeared
into
the
past
has
entered
suit
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
against
all
the
holders
of
land
on
manhattan
island
it
seems
that
during
the
two
weeks
in
which
the
tower
rested
in
the
wilderness
he
traded
independently
with
one
of
the
indian
chiefs
and
in
exchange
for
two
necklaces
sixteen
and
one
dollar
in
money
received
a
to
the
entire
he
claims
that
his
deed
is
a
conveyance
made
previous
to
all
other
sales
whatever
strictly
speaking
he
is
undoubtedly
right
as
his
deed
was
signed
before
the
discovery
of
america
the
courts
however
are
deliberating
the
question
with
a
great
deal
of
perplexity
eckstein
is
quite
confident
that
in
the
end
his
claim
will
be
allowed
and
he
will
be
admitted
as
the
sole
owner
of
on
manhattan
island
with
all
occupiers
of
buildings
and
territory
paying
him
ground
rent
at
a
rate
he
will
fix
himself
in
the
mean
time
though
the
foundations
are
being
reinforced
so
the
catastrophe
can
not
occur
again
his
entire
office
is
packed
full
of
articles
suitable
for
trading
with
the
indians
if
the
tower
makes
another
trip
back
through
time
eckstein
hopes
to
become
a
landholder
of
some
importance
no
less
than
books
have
been
written
by
members
of
the
memorable
two
thousand
in
description
of
their
trip
to
the
hinterland
of
time
but
arthur
who
could
write
more
intelligently
about
the
matter
than
any
one
else
is
so
extremely
busy
that
he
can
not
bother
with
such
things
he
has
two
very
important
matters
to
look
after
one
is
of
course
the
reenforcement
of
the
foundations
of
the
building
so
that
a
repetition
of
the
catastrophe
can
not
occur
and
the
other
is
to
convince
his
wife
who
is
estelle
naturally
that
she
is
the
most
adorable
person
in
the
universe
he
finds
the
latter
task
the
more
difficult
because
she
insists
that
is
the
most
adorable
person
