of

chapple
bachelor
of
house
wrykyn
let
us
examine
and
ponder
over
it
it
has
been
well
said
that
this
is
the
age
of
the
specialist
everybody
if
they
wish
to
leave
the
world
a
better
and
happier
place
for
their
stay
in
it
should
endeavour
to
adopt
some
speciality
and
make
it
their
own
chapple
speciality
was
being
late
for
breakfast
he
was
late
not
once
or
twice
but
every
day
sometimes
he
would
scramble
in
about
the
time
of
the
second
cup
of
coffee
buttoning
his
waistcoat
as
he
sidled
to
his
place
generally
he
would
arrive
just
as
the
rest
of
the
house
were
filing
out
when
having
lurked
hidden
until
seymour
was
out
of
the
way
he
would
enter
into
private
treaty
with
herbert
the
factotum
who
had
influence
with
the
cook
for
something
hot
and
maybe
a
fresh
brew
of
coffee
for
there
was
nothing
of
the
amateur
about
chapple
your
amateur
slinks
in
with
blushes
deepening
the
naturally
healthy
hue
of
his
face
and
bolting
a
piece
of
dry
bread
and
gulping
down
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
dashes
out
again
filled
more
with
good
resolutions
for
the
future
than
with
food
not
so
chapple
he
liked
his
meals
he
wanted
a
good
deal
here
below
and
wanted
it
hot
and
fresh
conscience
had
but
a
poor
time
when
it
tried
to
bully
chapple
he
had
it
weak
in
the
first
round
but
there
was
one
more
powerful
than
conscience
seymour
he
had
marked
the
constant
lateness
of
our
hero
and
disapproved
of
it
thus
it
happened
that
chapple
having
finished
an
excellent
breakfast
one
morning
some
twenty
minutes
after
everybody
else
was
informed
as
he
sat
in
the
junior
trying
with
the
help
of
an
illustrated
article
in
a
boys
paper
to
construct
a
handy
model
out
of
a
reel
of
cotton
and
an
old
for
his
was
in
many
ways
a
giant
brain
that
seymour
would
like
to
have
a
friendly
chat
with
him
in
his
study
laying
aside
his
handy
model
he
went
off
to
the
housemaster
study
you
were
late
for
breakfast
said
seymour
in
the
horrid
abrupt
way
housemasters
have
why
yes
sir
said
chapple
pleasantly
and
the
day
before
yes
sir
and
the
day
before
that
chapple
did
not
deny
it
he
stood
on
one
foot
and
smiled
a
propitiating
smile
so
far
seymour
was
entitled
to
demand
a
cigar
or
cocoanut
every
time
the
housemaster
walked
to
the
window
looked
out
returned
to
the
mantelpiece
and
shifted
the
position
of
a
china
vase
two
and
a
quarter
inches
to
the
left
chapple
by
way
of
spirited
repartee
stood
on
the
other
leg
and
curled
the
disengaged
foot
round
his
ankle
the
conversation
was
getting
quite
intellectual
you
will
write
out
sir
please
sir
interrupted
chapple
in
an
tone
of
voice
well
it
awfully
hard
to
hear
the
bell
from
where
i
sleep
sir
owing
to
the
increased
numbers
of
the
house
this
term
chapple
had
been
removed
from
his
dormitory
proper
to
a
small
room
some
distance
away
nonsense
the
bell
can
be
heard
perfectly
well
all
over
the
house
there
was
reason
in
what
he
said
herbert
who
woke
the
house
of
a
morning
did
so
by
ringing
a
bell
it
was
a
big
bell
and
he
enjoyed
ringing
it
few
sleepers
however
sound
could
dream
on
peacefully
through
herbert
morning
solo
after
five
seconds
of
it
they
would
turn
over
uneasily
after
seven
they
would
sit
up
at
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
a
minute
they
would
be
out
of
bed
and
you
would
be
wondering
where
they
picked
up
such
expressions
chapple
murmured
wordlessly
in
reply
he
realised
that
his
defence
was
a
thin
one
seymour
followed
up
his
advantage
you
will
write
a
hundred
lines
of
vergil
he
said
and
if
you
are
late
again
i
shall
double
them
chapple
retired
this
he
felt
was
a
crisis
he
had
been
pursuing
his
career
of
unpunctuality
so
long
that
he
had
never
quite
realised
that
a
time
might
come
when
the
authorities
would
drop
on
him
for
a
moment
he
felt
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
not
meet
wishes
in
the
matter
but
the
pluck
of
the
true
englishman
caused
him
to
reconsider
this
he
would
at
least
have
a
dash
at
it
i
tell
you
what
to
do
said
his
friend
brodie
when
consulted
on
the
point
over
a
quiet
pot
of
tea
that
afternoon
you
ought
to
sleep
without
so
many
things
on
the
bed
how
many
blankets
do
you
use
for
instance
i
do
know
said
chapple
as
many
as
they
shove
on
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
reckon
up
the
amount
of
his
bedclothes
before
retiring
to
rest
well
you
take
my
tip
said
brodie
and
only
sleep
with
one
on
then
the
cold
wake
you
in
the
morning
and
you
get
up
because
it
be
more
comfortable
than
staying
in
bed
this
scientific
plan
might
have
worked
in
fact
to
a
certain
extent
it
did
work
it
woke
chapple
in
the
morning
as
brodie
had
predicted
but
it
woke
him
at
the
wrong
hour
it
is
no
good
springing
out
of
bed
when
there
are
still
three
hours
to
breakfast
when
chapple
woke
at
five
the
next
morning
after
a
series
of
dreams
the
scenes
of
which
were
laid
mainly
in
the
arctic
regions
he
first
sneezed
then
he
piled
upon
the
bed
everything
he
could
find
including
his
boots
and
then
went
to
sleep
again
the
genial
warmth
oozed
through
his
form
and
continued
to
ooze
until
he
woke
once
more
this
time
at
breakfast
being
at
eight
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
position
with
seymour
was
not
improved
while
he
was
devoting
a
few
profound
meditation
to
this
point
the
genial
warmth
got
in
its
fell
work
once
again
when
he
next
woke
the
bell
was
ringing
for
school
he
lowered
the
world
record
for
rapid
dressing
and
was
just
in
time
to
accompany
the
tail
of
the
procession
into
the
you
were
late
again
this
morning
said
seymour
after
dinner
yes
sir
i
overslebbed
myselb
sir
replied
chapple
who
was
suffering
from
a
cold
in
the
head
two
hundred
lines
yes
sir
things
had
now
become
serious
it
was
no
good
going
to
brodie
again
for
counsel
brodie
had
done
for
himself
proved
himself
a
fraud
an
idiot
in
fine
a
rotter
he
must
try
somebody
else
happy
thought
spenlow
it
was
a
cold
day
when
spenlow
got
left
behind
he
would
know
what
to
do
was
a
chap
for
you
if
you
liked
young
mind
you
but
what
a
brain
colossal
what
should
do
said
spenlow
is
this
i
should
put
my
watch
on
half
an
hour
what
be
the
good
of
that
why
do
you
see
you
wake
up
and
find
it
was
ten
to
eight
say
by
your
watch
so
you
shove
on
the
pace
dressing
and
nip
downstairs
and
then
find
that
you
really
got
tons
of
time
what
price
that
but
i
should
remember
i
put
my
watch
on
objected
chapple
oh
no
probably
not
you
be
half
asleep
and
you
shoot
out
of
bed
before
you
remembered
and
that
all
you
want
it
the
getting
out
of
bed
that
so
difficult
if
you
were
once
out
you
want
to
get
back
again
oh
should
i
said
chapple
well
you
might
want
to
but
you
have
the
sense
not
to
do
it
it
not
a
bad
idea
said
chapple
thanks
that
night
he
took
his
waterbury
prised
open
the
face
with
a
as
if
he
were
opening
an
oyster
put
the
minute
hand
on
exactly
half
an
hour
and
retired
to
bed
satisfied
there
was
going
to
be
no
nonsense
about
it
this
time
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
the
reader
but
facts
are
facts
and
i
must
not
tamper
with
them
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
state
however
reluctantly
that
chapple
was
not
in
time
for
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
he
woke
at
seven
when
the
hands
of
the
watch
pointed
to
primed
with
virtuous
resolutions
he
was
just
about
to
leap
from
his
couch
when
his
memory
began
to
work
and
he
recollected
that
he
had
still
an
hour
punctuality
he
felt
was
an
excellent
thing
a
noble
virtue
in
fact
but
it
was
no
good
overdoing
it
he
could
give
himself
at
least
another
half
hour
so
he
dozed
off
he
woke
again
with
something
of
a
start
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
been
asleep
for
a
considerable
time
but
no
a
glance
at
the
watch
showed
the
hands
pointing
to
to
eight
minutes
more
he
had
a
good
long
doze
this
time
then
feeling
that
now
he
really
must
be
getting
up
he
looked
once
more
at
the
watch
and
rubbed
his
eyes
it
was
still
to
eight
the
fact
was
that
in
the
exhilaration
of
putting
the
hands
on
he
had
forgotten
that
other
and
even
more
important
operation
winding
up
the
watch
had
stopped
there
are
few
more
disturbing
sensations
than
that
of
suddenly
discovering
that
one
has
no
means
of
telling
the
time
this
is
especially
so
when
one
has
to
be
in
a
certain
place
by
a
certain
hour
it
gives
the
discoverer
a
weird
lost
feeling
as
if
he
had
stopped
dead
while
all
the
rest
of
the
world
had
moved
on
at
the
usual
rate
it
is
a
sensation
not
unlike
that
of
the
man
who
arrives
on
the
platform
of
a
railway
station
just
in
time
to
see
the
of
his
train
disappear
until
that
morning
the
world
record
for
dressing
set
up
the
day
before
had
been
five
minutes
and
a
fifth
seconds
he
lowered
this
by
two
seconds
and
went
downstairs
the
house
was
empty
in
the
passage
that
led
to
the
he
looked
at
the
clock
and
his
heart
turned
a
somersault
was
five
minutes
past
not
only
was
he
late
for
breakfast
but
late
for
school
too
never
before
had
he
brought
off
the
double
event
there
was
a
little
unpleasantness
in
his
form
room
when
he
stole
in
at
seven
minutes
past
the
hour
dexter
his
never
a
jolly
sort
of
man
to
have
dealings
with
was
rather
bitter
on
the
subject
you
are
incorrigibly
lazy
and
unpunctual
said
dexter
towards
the
end
of
the
address
you
will
do
me
a
hundred
lines
said
chapple
but
he
felt
at
the
time
that
it
was
not
much
of
a
repartee
after
dinner
there
was
the
usual
interview
with
seymour
you
were
late
again
this
morning
he
said
yes
sir
said
chapple
two
hundred
lines
yes
sir
the
thing
was
becoming
monotonous
chapple
pulled
himself
together
this
must
stop
he
had
said
that
several
times
previously
but
now
he
meant
it
nor
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
should
make
him
oversleep
himself
again
this
time
he
would
try
a
combination
of
schemes
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
put
his
watch
on
half
an
hour
wound
it
up
and
placed
it
on
a
chair
at
his
bedside
then
he
seized
his
rug
and
all
the
blankets
except
one
and
tore
them
off
then
he
piled
them
in
an
untidy
heap
in
the
most
distant
corner
of
the
room
he
meant
to
put
temptation
out
of
his
reach
there
should
be
no
genial
warmth
on
this
occasion
nor
was
there
he
woke
at
six
feeling
as
if
he
were
one
solid
chunk
of
ice
he
put
up
with
it
in
a
torpid
sort
of
way
till
seven
then
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
it
would
not
be
pleasant
getting
up
and
going
downstairs
to
the
cheerless
junior
but
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
he
knew
that
if
he
once
wrapped
himself
in
the
blankets
which
stared
at
him
invitingly
from
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
he
was
lost
so
he
crawled
out
of
bed
shivering
washed
unenthusiastically
and
he
proceeded
to
put
on
his
clothes
downstairs
it
was
more
unpleasant
than
one
would
have
believed
possible
the
was
in
its
usual
state
of
disorder
the
fire
was
not
lit
there
was
a
vague
smell
of
apples
life
was
very
very
grey
there
seemed
no
brightness
in
it
at
all
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
once
more
the
task
of
constructing
a
handy
model
but
he
speedily
realised
what
he
had
suspected
before
that
the
instructions
were
the
work
of
a
dangerous
madman
what
was
the
good
of
going
on
living
when
gibbering
lunatics
were
allowed
to
write
for
weekly
papers
about
this
time
his
gloom
was
deepened
by
the
discovery
that
a
tin
labelled
mixed
biscuits
which
he
had
noticed
in
brodie
locker
was
empty
he
thought
he
would
go
for
a
stroll
it
would
be
beastly
of
course
but
not
so
beastly
as
sitting
in
the
junior
it
is
just
here
that
the
tragedy
begins
to
deepen
passing
out
of
seymour
gate
he
met
brooke
of
appleby
brooke
wore
an
earnest
thoughtful
expression
hullo
brooke
said
chapple
where
are
you
off
to
it
seemed
that
brooke
was
off
to
the
carpenter
shop
hence
the
earnest
thoughtful
expression
his
mind
was
wrestling
with
certain
pieces
of
wood
which
he
proposed
to
fashion
into
photograph
frames
there
was
always
a
steady
demand
in
the
school
for
photograph
frames
and
the
gifted
were
in
the
habit
of
turning
here
and
there
an
honest
penny
by
means
of
them
the
artist
soul
is
not
always
unfavourable
to
a
gallery
brooke
said
he
did
mind
if
chapple
came
along
only
he
was
to
go
rotting
about
or
anything
so
chapple
went
along
arrived
at
the
carpenter
shop
brooke
was
soon
absorbed
in
his
labours
chapple
watched
him
for
a
time
with
the
interest
of
a
for
had
he
not
tried
to
construct
handy
model
in
his
day
indeed
yes
after
a
while
however
the
of
spectator
began
to
pall
he
wanted
to
something
wandering
round
the
room
he
found
a
chisel
and
upon
the
instant
in
direct
contravention
of
the
treaty
respecting
rotting
he
sat
down
and
started
carving
his
name
on
a
smooth
deal
board
which
looked
as
if
nobody
wanted
it
the
pair
worked
on
in
silence
broken
only
by
an
occasional
hard
breath
as
the
toil
grew
exciting
tongue
was
out
and
performing
mystic
evolutions
as
he
carved
the
letters
he
felt
inspired
he
was
beginning
the
a
when
he
was
brought
to
earth
again
by
the
voice
of
brooke
you
an
idiot
said
brooke
complainingly
board
and
now
you
spoilt
it
spoilt
it
chapple
liked
that
spoilt
it
if
you
please
when
he
had
done
a
beautiful
piece
of
carving
on
it
well
it
ca
be
helped
now
said
brooke
philosophically
i
suppose
it
not
your
fault
you
such
an
ass
anyhow
come
on
now
it
struck
eight
it
what
gasped
chapple
struck
eight
but
it
does
matter
appleby
never
minds
one
being
a
bit
late
for
breakfast
oh
said
chapple
oh
does
he
go
into
seymour
at
eight
sharp
any
morning
and
look
down
the
table
and
you
will
see
the
face
of
chapple
obscured
every
now
and
then
perhaps
by
a
coffee
cup
or
a
slice
of
bread
and
marmalade
he
has
not
been
late
for
three
weeks
the
spare
room
is
now
occupied
by
postlethwaite
of
the
upper
fourth
whose
place
in
milton
dormitory
has
been
taken
by
chapple
milton
is
the
head
of
the
house
and
stands
alone
among
the
house
prefects
for
the
strenuousness
of
his
methods
in
dealing
with
his
dormitory
nothing
in
this
world
is
certain
but
it
is
highly
improbable
that
chapple
will
be
late
again
there
are
shields
and
the
cricket
cup
the
house
cricket
cup
at
wrykyn
has
found
itself
on
some
strange
mantelpieces
in
its
time
new
talent
has
a
way
of
cropping
up
in
the
house
matches
men
hit
up
fifties
and
bowlers
who
have
never
taken
a
wicket
before
except
at
the
nets
go
on
fifth
change
and
dismiss
first
eleven
experts
with
deliveries
that
bounce
twice
and
shoot
so
that
nobody
is
greatly
surprised
in
the
ordinary
run
of
things
if
the
cup
does
not
go
to
the
favourites
or
even
to
the
second
or
third
favourites
but
one
likes
to
draw
the
line
and
wrykyn
drew
it
at
shields
and
yet
as
we
shall
proceed
to
show
shields
once
won
the
cup
and
that
too
in
a
year
when
donaldson
had
four
first
eleven
men
and
dexter
three
shields
occupied
a
unique
position
at
the
school
it
was
an
absolutely
inconspicuous
house
there
were
other
houses
that
were
slack
or
wild
or
both
but
the
worst
of
these
did
something
never
did
anything
it
never
seemed
to
want
to
do
anything
this
may
have
been
due
in
some
degree
to
shields
as
the
housemaster
is
so
the
house
is
he
was
the
most
inconspicuous
master
on
the
staff
he
taught
a
minute
form
in
the
junior
school
where
earnest
infants
wrestled
with
somebody
handy
book
of
easy
latin
sentences
and
depraved
infants
threw
cunningly
compounded
at
one
another
and
the
ceiling
after
school
he
would
range
the
countryside
with
a
in
search
of
polly
woggles
and
other
big
game
which
he
subsequently
transferred
to
slides
and
examined
through
a
microscope
till
an
advanced
hour
of
the
night
the
curious
part
of
the
matter
was
that
his
house
was
never
riotous
perhaps
he
was
looked
on
as
a
one
whom
it
would
be
unfair
and
unsporting
to
rag
at
any
rate
a
weird
calm
reigned
over
the
place
and
this
spirit
seemed
to
permeate
the
public
lives
of
the
shieldsites
they
said
nothing
much
and
they
did
nothing
much
and
they
were
very
inoffensive
as
a
rule
one
hardly
knew
they
were
there
into
this
abode
of
came
clephane
a
day
boy
owing
to
the
departure
of
his
parents
for
india
clephane
wanted
to
go
to
donaldson
in
fact
he
said
so
his
expressions
indeed
when
he
found
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
settled
and
that
he
was
to
spend
his
last
term
at
school
at
a
house
which
had
never
turned
out
so
much
as
a
member
of
the
gym
six
bordered
on
the
unfilial
it
appeared
that
his
father
had
met
shields
at
dinner
in
the
town
a
fact
to
which
he
seemed
to
attach
a
mystic
importance
clephane
criticism
of
this
attitude
of
mind
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
lead
his
father
to
address
him
as
archibald
instead
of
archie
however
the
thing
was
done
and
clephane
showed
his
good
sense
by
realising
this
and
turning
his
energetic
mind
to
the
discovery
of
the
best
way
of
making
life
at
shields
endurable
fortune
favoured
him
by
sending
to
the
house
another
day
boy
one
mansfield
clephane
had
not
known
him
intimately
before
though
they
were
both
members
of
the
second
eleven
but
at
shields
they
instantly
formed
an
alliance
and
in
due
season
or
a
little
later
the
house
matches
began
henfrey
of
day
the
wrykyn
cricket
captain
met
clephane
at
the
nets
when
the
drawing
for
opponents
had
been
done
just
the
man
i
wanted
to
see
said
henfrey
i
suppose
captain
of
shields
lot
clephane
well
you
going
to
scratch
as
usual
i
suppose
for
the
last
five
seasons
that
lamentable
house
had
failed
to
put
a
team
into
the
field
you
better
said
henfrey
we
overmuch
time
as
it
is
that
match
with
paget
team
has
thrown
us
out
a
lot
we
ought
to
have
started
the
house
matches
a
week
ago
scratch
said
clephane
do
you
wish
we
would
my
good
chap
we
going
to
get
the
cup
you
need
be
a
funny
ass
said
henfrey
in
his
complaining
voice
we
really
are
awfully
pushed
as
it
is
we
shall
have
to
settle
the
opening
rounds
on
the
first
innings
that
to
say
we
can
only
give
a
day
each
if
they
do
finish
the
winner
of
the
first
innings
wins
you
might
as
well
scratch
i
ca
help
your
troubles
by
rotten
mismanagement
you
have
got
the
crowded
up
into
the
last
ten
days
of
term
and
you
come
and
expect
me
to
sell
a
fine
side
like
shields
to
get
you
out
of
the
consequences
of
your
reckless
act
my
word
henfrey
you
sunk
pretty
low
nice
young
fellow
henfrey
was
at
one
time
but
seems
to
have
got
among
bad
companions
quite
changed
now
avoid
him
as
much
as
i
can
leave
me
henfrey
i
would
be
alone
but
you
ca
raise
a
team
raise
a
team
do
you
happen
to
know
that
half
the
house
is
itself
with
agony
because
we
ca
find
room
for
all
shields
gives
in
his
study
after
prep
one
every
time
you
hit
the
ball
two
into
the
bowl
of
goldfish
and
out
if
you
smash
the
microscope
well
said
henfrey
viciously
if
you
want
to
go
through
the
farce
of
playing
one
round
and
making
idiots
of
yourselves
you
have
to
wait
a
bit
you
got
a
bye
in
the
first
round
clephane
told
the
news
to
mansfield
after
tea
i
been
and
let
the
house
in
for
a
rollicking
time
he
said
abstracting
the
copy
of
latin
verses
which
his
friend
was
doing
and
sitting
on
them
to
ensure
undivided
attention
to
his
words
wanting
to
score
off
old
henfrey
i
have
few
pleasures
i
told
him
that
shields
was
not
going
to
scratch
so
we
are
booked
to
play
in
the
second
round
of
the
housers
we
drew
a
bye
for
the
first
it
would
be
an
awful
rag
if
we
could
do
something
we
raise
a
team
of
some
sort
henfrey
would
score
so
if
we
did
who
there
think
that
can
play
mansfield
considered
the
question
thoughtfully
they
all
i
suppose
he
said
slowly
if
you
can
call
it
playing
what
i
mean
to
say
is
cricket
compulsory
here
so
i
suppose
they
all
had
an
innings
or
two
at
one
time
or
another
in
the
eightieth
game
or
so
but
if
you
want
i
should
trust
to
shields
too
much
not
a
bit
so
long
as
we
put
a
full
team
into
the
field
that
all
i
care
about
i
often
wondered
what
it
like
to
go
in
first
and
bowl
unchanged
the
whole
time
you
do
that
all
right
said
mansfield
i
should
think
bowling
ran
to
slow
grubs
to
judge
from
the
look
of
you
better
go
and
see
wilkins
about
raising
the
team
as
head
of
the
house
he
probably
considers
himself
captain
of
cricket
wilkins
however
took
a
far
more
modest
view
of
his
position
the
notion
of
leading
a
happy
band
of
cricketers
from
shields
into
the
field
had
it
seemed
small
attractions
for
him
but
he
went
so
far
as
to
get
a
house
list
and
help
choose
a
really
representative
team
and
as
details
about
historic
teams
are
always
welcome
we
may
say
that
the
averages
ranged
from
to
this
last
was
wilkins
own
and
was
as
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
admit
substantially
helped
by
a
contribution
of
nineteen
in
a
single
innings
in
the
fifth
game
so
the
team
was
selected
and
clephane
turned
out
after
school
next
day
to
give
them
a
little
to
his
surprise
the
fielding
was
not
so
outrageous
as
might
have
been
expected
all
the
simpler
catches
were
held
and
one
or
two
of
the
harder
as
well
given
this
form
on
the
day
of
their
appearance
in
public
and
henfrey
might
be
disappointed
when
he
came
to
watch
and
smile
sarcastically
a
batting
fiasco
is
not
one
half
so
ridiculous
as
maniac
fielding
in
the
meantime
the
first
round
of
the
house
matches
had
been
played
off
and
it
would
be
as
well
to
describe
at
this
point
the
positions
of
the
rival
houses
and
their
prospects
in
the
first
place
there
were
only
four
teams
really
in
the
running
for
the
cup
day
headed
by
the
redoubtable
henfrey
spence
who
had
jackson
that
season
a
head
and
shoulders
above
the
other
batsmen
in
the
first
eleven
he
had
just
wound
up
the
school
season
with
an
average
of
donaldson
and
dexter
all
the
other
house
teams
were
mainly
tail
now
in
the
first
round
the
powerful
quartette
had
been
diminished
by
the
fact
that
donaldson
had
drawn
dexter
and
had
lost
to
them
by
a
couple
of
wickets
for
the
second
round
shields
drew
appleby
a
poor
team
space
on
the
wrykyn
field
being
a
consideration
with
three
house
matches
to
be
played
off
at
the
same
time
clephane
men
fought
their
first
battle
on
rugged
ground
in
an
obscure
corner
as
the
captain
of
cricket
ordered
these
matters
henfrey
had
naturally
selected
the
best
bit
of
turf
for
day
dexter
that
section
of
the
ground
which
was
sacred
to
the
school
matches
was
allotted
to
spence
the
school
house
the
idle
public
divided
its
attention
between
the
two
big
games
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
death
struggle
in
progress
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
whereby
it
missed
a
deal
of
quiet
fun
i
say
death
struggle
advisedly
clephane
had
won
his
cap
as
a
fast
bowler
he
had
failed
to
get
into
the
first
eleven
because
he
was
considered
too
erratic
put
these
two
facts
together
and
you
will
suspect
that
dark
deeds
were
wrought
on
the
men
of
appleby
in
that
lonely
corner
of
the
wrykyn
meadow
the
pitch
was
not
a
good
one
as
a
sample
of
the
groundman
art
it
was
sketchy
and
amateurish
it
lacked
finish
clephane
won
the
toss
took
a
hasty
glance
at
the
corrugated
turf
and
decided
to
bat
first
the
wicket
was
hardly
likely
to
improve
with
use
he
and
mansfield
opened
the
batting
he
stood
three
feet
out
of
his
ground
and
smote
the
first
four
balls
he
took
full
pitch
the
last
two
owing
to
a
passion
for
variety
on
the
part
of
the
bowler
were
long
hops
at
the
end
of
the
over
shields
score
was
mansfield
pursued
the
same
tactics
when
the
first
wicket
fell
seventy
was
on
the
board
a
spirit
of
martial
enthusiasm
pervaded
the
ranks
of
the
house
team
mild
youths
with
spectacles
leaped
out
of
their
ground
like
tigers
and
snicked
fours
through
the
slips
when
the
innings
concluded
blood
had
been
spilt
from
an
injured
finger
but
the
total
was
a
hundred
and
two
then
clephane
walked
across
to
the
school
shop
for
a
vanilla
ice
he
said
he
could
get
more
devil
as
it
were
into
his
bowling
after
a
vanilla
ice
he
had
a
couple
when
he
bowled
his
first
ball
it
was
easy
to
see
that
there
was
truth
in
the
report
of
the
causes
of
his
inclusion
in
the
second
eleven
and
exclusion
from
the
first
the
batsman
observed
somewhat
weakly
here
i
and
backed
towards
square
leg
the
ball
soared
over
the
head
and
went
to
the
boundary
the
bowler
grinned
pleasantly
and
said
he
was
just
getting
his
arm
in
the
second
ball
landed
on
the
batsman
right
thigh
the
third
was
another
full
pitch
this
time
on
the
top
of
the
middle
stump
which
it
smashed
with
profound
satisfaction
the
batsman
hobbled
to
the
trees
and
sat
down
let
somebody
else
have
a
shot
he
said
kindly
appleby
made
that
innings
their
defeat
by
an
innings
and
runs
they
attributed
subsequently
to
the
fact
that
only
seven
of
the
team
could
be
induced
to
go
to
the
wickets
in
the
second
venture
so
you
managed
to
win
a
match
grunted
henfrey
i
should
like
to
have
been
there
you
might
just
as
well
have
been
said
clephane
from
what
they
tell
me
at
which
henfrey
became
abusive
for
he
had
achieved
an
egg
that
afternoon
and
missed
a
catch
which
things
soured
him
though
had
polished
off
dexter
handsomely
well
he
said
at
length
you
in
the
now
of
all
weird
places
you
better
play
spence
next
when
can
you
play
henfrey
said
clephane
i
have
a
bright
open
boyish
countenance
but
i
was
not
born
yesterday
you
want
to
get
a
dangerous
rival
out
of
the
way
without
trouble
so
you
set
shields
to
smash
up
spence
no
henfrey
i
do
not
intend
to
be
your
catspaw
we
will
draw
lots
who
is
to
play
which
here
comes
jackson
we
toss
odd
man
out
and
when
the
coins
fell
there
were
two
tails
and
one
head
and
the
head
belonged
to
the
coin
of
clephane
so
you
see
he
said
to
henfrey
shields
is
in
the
final
no
wonder
you
wanted
us
to
scratch
i
should
like
this
story
to
end
with
a
vivid
description
of
a
tight
finish
considering
that
day
beat
spence
and
consequently
met
shields
in
the
final
that
would
certainly
be
the
most
artistic
ending
henfrey
batting
clephane
bowling
one
to
tie
two
to
win
one
wicket
to
fall
up
goes
the
ball
will
the
lad
catch
it
he
fumbles
it
it
falls
all
is
over
but
look
with
a
supreme
effort
and
so
on
the
real
conclusion
was
a
little
sensational
in
its
way
but
not
nearly
so
exciting
as
that
the
match
between
day
and
shields
opened
in
a
conventional
enough
manner
day
batted
first
and
made
two
hundred
and
fifty
henfrey
carried
his
bat
for
and
there
were
some
thirties
for
shields
clephane
and
mansfield
made
their
usual
stand
and
the
rest
brought
the
total
up
to
at
this
point
henfrey
introduced
a
variation
on
custom
the
match
was
a
three
match
in
fact
owing
to
the
speed
with
which
the
other
games
had
been
played
it
could
if
necessary
last
four
days
the
was
therefore
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
side
which
led
henfrey
and
his
team
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
not
have
another
pleasant
spell
of
batting
before
dismissing
their
opponents
for
the
second
time
and
acquiring
the
cup
so
in
they
went
again
and
made
another
two
hundred
and
fifty
odd
shields
being
left
with
four
hundred
and
twelve
to
make
to
win
on
the
morning
after
day
second
innings
a
fag
from
day
brought
clephane
a
message
from
henfrey
henfrey
was
apparently
in
bed
he
would
be
glad
if
clephane
would
go
and
see
him
in
the
the
interview
lasted
fifteen
minutes
then
clephane
burst
out
of
the
house
and
dashed
across
to
shields
in
search
of
mansfield
i
say
you
heard
he
shouted
what
up
why
every
man
in
day
team
bar
two
kids
is
in
bed
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
heard
they
thought
they
got
that
house
cup
safe
so
all
the
team
except
the
two
kids
fags
you
know
had
a
feed
in
honour
of
it
in
henfrey
study
some
ass
went
and
bought
a
bad
rabbit
pie
and
now
they
laid
up
not
badly
but
they
wo
be
out
for
a
day
or
two
but
what
about
the
match
oh
that
go
on
i
made
a
point
of
that
they
can
play
subs
mansfield
looked
thoughtful
but
i
say
he
said
it
is
very
sporting
is
it
ought
we
to
wait
or
something
sporting
my
dear
chap
a
case
like
this
must
be
judged
by
ordinary
standards
we
ca
spoil
the
giant
rag
of
the
century
because
it
is
quite
sporting
think
what
it
means
shields
getting
the
cup
it
keep
the
school
laughing
for
terms
what
do
you
want
to
spoil
people
pleasure
for
oh
all
right
said
mansfield
besides
think
of
the
moral
effect
it
have
on
the
house
it
may
turn
it
into
the
blood
house
of
wrykyn
shields
himself
may
get
quite
sportive
we
must
miss
the
chance
the
news
having
got
about
the
school
clephane
and
mansfield
opened
their
second
innings
to
the
somewhat
embarrassed
trundling
of
masters
royce
and
tibbit
of
the
junior
school
before
a
substantial
and
appreciative
audience
both
played
carefully
at
first
but
soon
getting
the
measure
of
the
bowling
which
was
not
deep
began
to
hit
out
and
runs
came
quickly
at
fifty
tibbit
understudying
henfrey
as
captain
of
the
side
summoned
to
his
young
friend
todby
from
short
leg
and
instructed
him
to
have
a
go
at
the
top
end
it
was
here
that
clephane
courteously
interfered
substitutes
he
pointed
out
were
allowed
by
the
laws
of
cricket
only
to
field
not
to
bowl
he
must
therefore
request
friend
todby
to
return
to
his
former
sphere
of
utility
where
he
added
politely
he
was
a
perfect
demon
but
blow
it
said
master
tibbit
who
alas
was
addicted
to
the
use
of
strong
language
royce
and
i
ca
bowl
the
whole
blessed
time
you
have
to
i
afraid
said
clephane
with
the
kindly
air
of
a
doctor
soothing
a
refractory
patient
of
course
you
can
take
a
spell
at
grubs
whenever
you
like
oh
darn
said
master
tibbit
shortly
afterwards
clephane
made
his
century
the
match
ended
late
on
the
following
afternoon
in
a
victory
for
shields
by
nine
wickets
and
the
scene
at
the
school
shop
when
royce
and
tibbit
arrived
to
drown
their
sorrows
and
moisten
their
dry
throats
with
ginger
beer
is
said
by
eyewitnesses
to
have
been
something
quite
out
of
the
common
run
the
score
sheet
of
the
match
is
also
a
little
unusual
three
hundred
and
one
not
out
is
described
in
the
as
a
masterly
exhibition
of
sound
yet
aggressive
batting
how
henfrey
described
it
we
have
never
heard
an
international
affair
part
the
whole
thing
may
be
said
to
have
begun
when
oliver
ring
of
new
york
changing
cars
as
he
called
it
at
wrykyn
on
his
way
to
london
had
to
wait
an
hour
for
his
train
he
put
in
that
hour
by
strolling
about
the
town
and
seeing
the
sights
which
were
not
numerous
wrykyn
except
on
market
day
was
wont
to
be
wrapped
in
a
primaeval
calm
which
very
nearly
brought
tears
to
the
strenuous
eyes
of
the
man
from
manhattan
he
had
always
been
told
that
england
was
a
slow
country
and
his
visit
now
in
its
third
week
had
confirmed
this
opinion
but
even
in
england
he
had
not
looked
to
find
such
a
place
as
wrykyn
he
looked
at
the
shop
windows
they
resembled
the
shop
windows
of
every
other
country
town
in
england
there
was
no
dash
no
initiative
about
them
they
did
not
leap
to
the
eye
and
arrest
the
progress
they
ordered
these
things
thought
ring
better
in
the
states
and
then
something
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
that
here
was
the
place
to
set
up
a
branch
of
ring
stores
during
his
stroll
he
had
gathered
certain
pieces
of
information
to
wit
that
wrykyn
was
where
the
county
families
for
ten
miles
round
did
their
shopping
that
the
population
of
the
town
was
larger
than
would
appear
at
first
sight
to
a
casual
observer
and
finally
that
there
was
a
school
of
six
hundred
boys
only
a
mile
away
nothing
could
be
better
within
a
month
he
would
take
to
himself
the
entire
trade
of
the
neighbourhood
it
a
cinch
murmured
ring
with
a
glad
smile
as
he
boarded
his
train
a
cinch
everybody
who
has
moved
about
the
world
at
all
knows
ring
stores
the
main
office
is
in
new
york
broadway
to
be
exact
on
the
left
as
you
go
down
just
before
you
get
to
park
row
where
the
newspapers
come
from
there
is
another
office
in
chicago
others
in
louis
paul
and
across
the
seas
in
london
paris
berlin
and
in
short
everywhere
the
peculiar
advantage
about
ring
stores
is
that
you
can
get
anything
you
happen
to
want
there
from
a
motor
to
a
macaroon
and
rather
cheaper
than
you
could
get
it
anywhere
else
england
had
up
to
the
present
been
with
these
handy
paradises
the
one
in
piccadilly
being
the
only
extant
specimen
but
now
ring
in
person
had
crossed
the
atlantic
on
a
tour
of
inspection
and
things
were
shortly
to
be
so
brisk
that
you
would
be
able
to
hear
them
whizz
so
an
army
of
workmen
invaded
wrykyn
a
trio
of
decrepit
houses
in
the
high
street
were
pulled
down
with
a
run
and
from
the
ruins
there
began
to
rise
like
a
phoenix
the
striking
building
which
was
to
be
the
wrykyn
branch
of
ring
stores
the
sensation
among
the
tradesmen
caused
by
the
invasion
was
as
may
be
imagined
immense
and
painful
the
thing
was
a
public
disaster
it
resembled
the
advent
of
a
fox
in
a
for
years
the
tradesmen
of
wrykyn
had
jogged
along
in
their
comfortable
way
each
making
his
little
profits
with
no
thought
of
competition
or
modern
hustle
and
now
the
enemy
was
at
their
doors
many
were
the
gloomy
looks
cast
at
the
gaudy
building
as
it
grew
like
a
mushroom
it
was
finished
with
incredible
speed
and
then
advertisements
began
to
flood
the
local
papers
a
special
sheaf
of
bills
was
despatched
to
the
school
dunstable
got
hold
of
one
and
read
it
with
interest
then
he
went
in
search
of
his
friend
linton
to
find
out
what
he
thought
of
it
linton
was
at
work
in
the
laboratory
he
was
an
enthusiastic
but
unskilful
chemist
the
only
thing
he
could
do
with
any
real
certainty
was
to
make
oxygen
but
he
had
ambitions
beyond
that
feat
and
was
continually
experimenting
in
a
reckless
way
which
made
the
chemistry
master
look
wan
and
uneasy
he
was
bending
over
a
complicated
mixture
of
tubes
acids
and
bunsen
burners
when
dunstable
found
him
it
was
after
school
so
that
the
laboratory
was
empty
but
for
them
do
mind
me
said
dunstable
taking
a
seat
on
the
table
look
out
man
do
jog
sit
tight
and
i
broaden
your
mind
for
you
i
take
this
bit
of
litmus
paper
and
dip
it
into
this
bilge
and
if
i
done
it
right
it
turn
blue
then
i
bet
it
does
said
dunstable
the
paper
turned
red
hades
said
linton
calmly
well
i
not
going
to
sweat
at
it
any
more
let
go
down
to
cook
cook
is
the
one
school
institution
which
nobody
forgets
who
has
been
to
wrykyn
it
is
a
little
confectioner
shop
in
the
high
street
its
exterior
is
somewhat
forbidding
and
the
uninitiated
would
probably
shudder
and
pass
on
wondering
how
on
earth
such
a
place
could
find
a
public
daring
enough
to
support
it
by
eating
its
wares
but
the
school
went
there
in
flocks
tea
at
cook
was
the
alternative
to
a
study
tea
there
was
a
large
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
here
oceans
of
hot
tea
and
tons
of
toast
were
consumed
the
staff
of
consisted
of
cook
late
sergeant
in
a
line
regiment
six
foot
three
disposition
amiable
left
leg
cut
off
above
the
knee
by
a
spirited
fuzzy
in
the
last
soudan
war
cook
wife
of
the
above
disposition
similar
and
possessing
the
useful
gift
of
being
able
to
listen
to
five
people
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
an
invisible
menial
or
menials
who
made
toast
in
some
nether
region
at
a
perfectly
dizzy
rate
of
speed
such
was
cook
talking
of
cook
said
dunstable
producing
his
pamphlet
have
you
seen
this
it
be
a
bit
of
a
for
them
i
should
think
linton
took
the
paper
and
began
to
read
dunstable
roamed
curiously
about
the
laboratory
examining
things
what
are
these
little
crystal
sort
of
bits
of
stuff
he
asked
coming
to
a
standstill
before
a
large
jar
and
opening
it
they
look
good
to
eat
shall
i
try
one
do
you
be
an
idiot
said
the
expert
looking
up
what
have
you
got
hold
of
great
scott
no
do
eat
that
stuff
why
not
is
it
poison
no
but
it
would
make
you
sick
as
a
cat
it
sal
ammoniac
sal
how
much
ammoniac
you
be
awfully
bad
all
right
then
i
wo
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
thing
it
be
rough
on
cook
wo
it
you
see
they
advertise
a
special
tea
as
they
call
it
it
sounds
jolly
good
i
know
what
buckwheat
cakes
are
but
they
ought
to
be
decent
i
suppose
now
everybody
chuck
cook
and
go
there
it
a
beastly
shame
considering
that
cook
has
been
a
sort
of
school
shop
so
long
and
they
really
depend
on
the
school
at
least
one
never
sees
anybody
else
going
there
well
i
shall
stick
to
cook
i
do
want
any
of
your
beastly
yankee
invaders
support
home
industries
be
a
patriot
the
band
then
played
god
save
the
king
and
the
meeting
dispersed
but
seriously
man
i
am
rather
sick
about
this
the
cooks
are
such
awfully
good
sorts
and
this
is
bound
to
make
them
lose
a
tremendous
lot
the
school
simply
crawling
with
chaps
who
do
anything
to
get
a
good
tea
cheaper
than
they
getting
now
they
simply
scrum
in
to
this
new
place
well
i
do
see
what
we
can
do
said
linton
except
keep
on
going
to
cook
ourselves
let
be
going
now
by
the
way
we
get
as
many
chaps
as
we
can
to
promise
to
stick
to
them
but
we
ca
prevent
the
rest
going
where
they
like
come
on
the
atmosphere
at
cook
that
evening
was
heavily
charged
with
gloom
exsergeant
cook
usually
a
treasury
of
jest
and
anecdote
was
silent
and
thoughtful
cook
bustled
about
with
her
customary
vigour
but
she
too
was
disinclined
for
conversation
the
place
was
ominously
empty
a
quartette
of
school
house
juniors
in
one
corner
and
a
solitary
prefect
from
donaldson
completed
the
sum
of
the
customers
nobody
seemed
to
want
to
talk
a
great
deal
there
was
something
in
the
air
which
as
plain
as
whisper
in
the
ear
the
place
is
and
so
it
was
haunted
by
the
spectre
of
that
hideous
new
glaring
building
down
the
street
which
had
opened
its
doors
to
the
public
on
the
previous
afternoon
look
there
said
dunstable
as
they
came
out
he
pointed
along
the
street
the
doors
of
the
new
establishment
were
congested
a
crowd
made
up
of
members
of
various
houses
was
pushing
to
get
past
another
crowd
which
was
trying
to
get
out
the
tea
at
one
shilling
appeared
to
have
proved
attractive
look
at
said
dunstable
sordid
beasts
all
they
care
about
is
filling
themselves
there
goes
that
man
merrett
with
him
here
come
four
more
come
on
it
makes
me
sick
i
wish
it
would
make
sick
said
linton
perhaps
it
will
by
george
he
started
what
up
said
linton
oh
nothing
i
was
only
thinking
of
something
they
walked
on
without
further
conversation
dunstable
brain
was
working
fast
he
had
an
idea
and
was
busy
developing
it
the
manager
of
the
wrykyn
branch
of
ring
stores
stood
at
the
entrance
to
his
shop
on
the
following
afternoon
spitting
with
energy
and
precision
on
to
the
pavement
he
was
a
american
citizen
and
eyeing
the
high
street
as
a
monarch
might
gaze
at
his
kingdom
he
had
just
completed
a
highly
satisfactory
report
to
headquarters
and
was
feeling
contented
with
the
universe
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
managed
even
in
the
short
time
since
the
opening
of
the
store
he
had
managed
to
wake
up
the
sluggish
britishers
as
if
they
had
had
an
electric
shock
we
he
observed
epigrammatically
to
a
passing
cat
which
had
stopped
on
its
way
to
look
at
him
are
it
as
he
spoke
he
perceived
a
youth
coming
towards
him
down
the
street
he
wore
a
cap
of
divers
colours
from
which
the
manager
argued
that
he
belonged
to
the
school
evidently
a
devotee
of
the
advertised
shillingsworth
and
one
who
as
urged
by
the
small
bills
had
come
early
to
avoid
the
rush
step
right
in
mister
he
said
moving
aside
from
the
doorway
and
what
can
i
do
for
are
you
the
manager
of
this
place
asked
dunstable
for
the
youth
was
that
strategist
and
no
other
on
the
bull
eye
first
time
replied
the
manager
with
easy
courtesy
will
you
take
a
cigar
or
a
can
i
have
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
you
if
you
are
busy
sure
step
right
in
now
sir
said
the
manager
what
little
trouble
it
about
this
public
school
tea
business
said
dunstable
rather
a
shame
you
see
before
you
came
bargeing
in
everybody
used
to
go
to
cook
and
now
interrupted
the
manager
they
come
to
us
correct
sir
we
the
main
stem
and
why
not
cook
such
a
good
sort
i
should
like
to
know
him
said
the
manager
politely
you
see
said
dunstable
it
does
so
much
matter
about
the
other
things
you
sell
but
cook
simply
relies
on
giving
fellows
tea
in
the
afternoon
one
moment
sir
said
the
man
from
the
states
let
me
remind
you
of
a
little
rule
which
will
be
useful
to
you
when
you
butt
into
the
big
cold
world
that
is
never
let
sentiment
interfere
with
business
see
either
ring
stores
or
your
friend
has
got
to
be
on
top
and
if
i
know
anything
it
going
to
be
we
we
and
i
afraid
that
all
i
can
do
for
you
unless
you
that
hungry
feeling
and
want
to
sample
our
tea
at
cents
no
thanks
said
dunstable
here
come
some
chaps
though
who
look
as
if
they
might
he
stepped
aside
as
half
a
dozen
school
house
juniors
raced
up
for
one
day
only
said
the
manager
to
dunstable
you
may
partake
free
if
you
care
to
you
have
man
most
priceless
possession
cool
cheek
and
cool
cheek
when
recognised
should
not
go
unrewarded
step
in
no
thanks
said
dunstable
you
find
me
at
cook
if
you
want
me
kindness
said
he
to
himself
as
cook
served
him
in
the
depressed
way
which
had
now
become
habitual
with
her
kindness
having
failed
we
must
try
severity
part
those
who
knew
and
liked
dunstable
were
both
pained
and
disgusted
at
his
behaviour
during
the
ensuing
three
days
he
suddenly
exhibited
a
weird
fondness
for
some
of
wrykyn
least
deserving
inmates
he
walked
over
to
school
with
merrett
of
seymour
and
ruthven
of
donaldson
both
notorious
outsiders
when
linton
wanted
him
to
come
and
play
fives
after
school
he
declined
on
the
ground
that
he
was
teaing
with
chadwick
of
appleby
now
in
the
matter
of
absolute
outsiderishness
chadwick
of
appleby
was
to
merrett
of
seymour
as
captain
is
to
subaltern
linton
was
horrified
and
said
so
what
do
you
want
to
do
it
for
he
asked
what
the
point
of
it
you
ca
like
those
chaps
awfully
good
sorts
when
you
get
to
know
them
said
dunstable
you
been
some
time
finding
it
out
i
know
chadwick
an
acquired
taste
by
the
way
i
giving
a
tea
on
thursday
will
you
come
who
going
to
be
there
inquired
linton
warily
well
chadwick
for
one
and
merrett
and
ruthven
and
three
other
chaps
then
said
linton
with
some
warmth
i
think
you
have
to
do
without
me
i
believe
you
mad
and
he
went
off
in
disgust
to
the
when
on
the
following
thursday
dunstable
walked
into
ring
stores
with
his
five
guests
and
demanded
six
teas
the
manager
was
perhaps
justified
in
allowing
a
triumphant
smile
to
wander
across
his
face
it
was
a
signal
victory
for
him
no
free
list
sir
he
said
entirely
suspended
never
mind
said
dunstable
i
good
for
six
shillings
free
list
said
merrett
as
the
manager
retired
i
did
know
there
was
one
there
is
only
he
and
i
palled
up
so
much
the
other
day
that
he
offered
me
a
tea
for
nothing
did
you
take

said
chadwick
you
take
my
tip
dun
old
chap
and
come
here
dun
old
chap
smiled
amiably
i
do
know
he
said
looking
up
from
the
into
which
he
had
been
pouring
water
you
can
be
certain
of
the
food
at
cook
what
do
you
mean
so
you
can
here
oh
said
dunstable
i
did
know
i
never
had
tea
here
before
but
i
often
heard
that
american
food
upsets
one
sometimes
by
this
time
the
tea
having
stood
long
enough
he
poured
out
and
the
meal
began
merrett
and
his
friends
were
hearty
feeders
and
conversation
languished
for
some
time
then
chadwick
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
breathed
heavily
you
could
get
stuff
like
that
at
cook
he
said
i
suppose
it
is
a
bit
different
said
dunstable
have
any
of
you
noticed
something
queer
merrett
stared
at
ruthven
ruthven
stared
at
merrett
i
said
merrett
know
said
ruthven
chadwick
face
was
a
delicate
green
i
believe
said
dunstable
the
stuff
was
poisoned
i
drink
this
said
the
school
doctor
briskly
bending
over
dunstable
bed
with
a
in
his
hand
and
be
ashamed
of
yourself
the
fact
is
you
yourself
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
why
ca
you
boys
be
content
to
feed
moderately
i
do
think
i
ate
much
sir
protested
dunstable
it
must
have
been
what
i
ate
i
went
to
that
new
american
place
so
went
there
too
why
i
just
come
from
attending
a
bilious
boy
in
seymour
house
he
said
he
had
been
at
the
american
place
too
was
that
merrett
sir
he
was
one
of
the
party
we
were
all
bad
we
ca
all
have
eaten
too
much
the
doctor
looked
thoughtful
h
curious
very
curious
do
you
remember
what
you
had
i
had
some
things
the
man
called
buckwheat
cakes
with
some
stuff
he
said
was
maple
syrup
bah
american
trash
the
doctor
was
a
staunch
briton
conservative
in
his
views
both
on
politics
and
on
food
why
ca
you
boys
eat
good
english
food
i
must
tell
the
headmaster
of
this
i
have
time
to
look
after
the
school
if
all
the
boys
are
going
to
poison
themselves
you
lie
still
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
and
you
be
right
enough
in
no
time
but
dunstable
did
not
go
to
sleep
he
stayed
awake
to
interview
linton
who
came
to
pay
him
a
visit
well
said
linton
looking
down
at
the
sufferer
with
an
expression
that
was
a
delicate
blend
of
pity
and
contempt
you
made
a
nice
sort
of
ass
of
yourself
have
you
i
do
know
if
it
any
consolation
to
you
but
merrett
just
as
bad
as
you
are
and
i
hear
the
others
are
too
so
now
you
see
what
comes
of
going
to
instead
of
cook
and
now
said
dunstable
if
you
quite
finished
you
can
listen
to
me
for
a
bit
so
now
you
know
he
concluded
linton
face
beamed
with
astonishment
and
admiration
well
i
hanged
he
said
you
a
marvel
but
how
did
you
know
it
would
poison
you
i
relied
on
you
you
said
it
was
poison
when
i
asked
you
in
the
lab
my
faith
in
you
is
touching
but
why
did
you
take
any
yourself
sort
of
idea
of
diverting
suspicion
but
the
thing
is
finished
yet
listen
linton
left
the
dormitory
five
minutes
later
with
a
look
of
a
young
disciple
engaged
on
some
holy
mission
part
you
think
the
food
is
unwholesome
then
said
the
headmaster
after
dinner
that
night
unwholesome
said
the
school
doctor
it
must
be
deadly
it
must
be
positively
lethal
here
we
have
six
ordinary
strong
healthy
boys
struck
down
at
one
fell
swoop
as
if
there
were
a
pestilence
raging
why
one
moment
said
the
headmaster
come
in
a
small
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
please
sir
said
the
figure
in
the
strained
voice
of
one
speaking
a
piece
which
he
has
committed
to
memory
seymour
says
please
would
you
mind
letting
the
doctor
come
to
his
house
at
once
because
linton
is
what
exclaimed
the
doctor
what
the
matter
with
him
please
sir
i
believe
it
buckwheat
cakes
what
and
here
another
of
them
a
second
small
figure
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
sir
please
sir
said
the
newcomer
bradfield
says
may
the
doctor
and
what
boy
is
it
time
please
sir
it
brown
he
went
to
ring
stores
the
headmaster
rose
perhaps
you
had
better
go
at
once
oakes
he
said
this
is
becoming
serious
that
place
is
a
positive
menace
to
the
community
i
shall
put
it
out
of
bounds
tomorrow
morning
and
when
dunstable
and
linton
pale
but
cheerful
made
their
way
slowly
as
befitted
convalescents
to
cook
two
days
afterwards
they
had
to
sit
on
the
counter
all
the
other
seats
were
occupied
the
guardian
in
his
sunday
suit
with
ten
shillings
in
specie
in
the
trouser
pocket
and
a
bowler
hat
the
youngest
of
the
shearnes
thomas
beauchamp
algernon
was
being
launched
by
the
combined
strength
of
the
family
on
his
career
it
was
a
solemn
moment
the
landscape
was
dotted
with
relatives
here
a
small
sister
awed
by
the
occasion
into
refraining
from
insult
there
an
aunt
vaguely
admonitory
well
tom
said
shearne
you
soon
be
off
now
you
sure
to
like
eckleton
remember
to
cultivate
your
bowling
everyone
can
bat
nowadays
and
play
forward
not
outside
the
outsides
get
most
of
the
fun
certainly
but
then
if
you
a
forward
you
got
eight
chances
of
getting
into
a
team
all
right
father
oh
and
work
hard
this
by
way
of
an
afterthought
all
right
father
and
tom
said
shearne
you
are
sure
to
be
comfortable
at
school
because
i
asked
davy
to
write
to
her
sister
spencer
who
has
a
son
at
eckleton
and
tell
her
to
tell
him
to
look
after
you
when
you
get
there
he
is
in
dencroft
house
which
is
next
door
to
blackburn
so
you
will
be
quite
close
to
one
another
mind
you
write
directly
you
get
there
all
right
mother
and
look
here
tom
his
eldest
brother
stepped
to
the
front
and
spoke
earnestly
look
here
do
you
forget
what
i
been
telling
you
all
right
you
be
right
enough
if
you
do
go
sticking
on
side
do
forget
that
however
much
of
a
blood
you
may
have
been
at
that
rotten
little
private
school
of
yours
you
not
one
at
eckleton
all
right
you
look
clean
which
is
the
great
thing
there
nothing
much
wrong
with
you
except
cheek
you
got
enough
of
that
to
float
a
ship
keep
it
under
all
right
keep
your
hair
on
there
you
go
said
the
expert
with
gloomy
triumph
if
you
say
that
sort
of
thing
at
eckleton
you
get
jolly
well
sat
on
by
jove
bai
jove
old
chap
murmured
the
younger
brother
we
devils
in
the
the
other
whose
chief
sorrow
in
life
was
that
he
could
not
get
the
smaller
members
of
the
family
to
look
with
proper
awe
on
the
fact
that
he
had
just
passed
into
sandhurst
gazed
wistfully
at
the
speaker
but
realising
that
there
was
a
locked
door
between
them
tried
no
active
measures
well
anyhow
he
said
you
soon
get
it
knocked
out
of
you
that
one
comfort
look
here
if
you
do
get
scrapping
with
anybody
do
forget
all
i
taught
you
and
i
should
go
on
boxing
there
if
i
were
you
so
as
to
go
down
to
aldershot
some
day
you
ought
to
make
a
fairly
decent
featherweight
if
you
practise
all
right
let
know
when
eckleton
playing
haileybury
and
i
come
and
look
you
up
i
want
to
see
that
match
all
right
tom
tom
dear
chorus
of
aunts
and
other
supers
goodbye
tom
tom
comprehensively
the
train
left
the
station
kennedy
the
head
of
dencroft
said
that
when
he
wanted
his
study
turned
into
a
beastly
furnace
he
would
take
care
to
let
spencer
know
he
pointed
out
that
just
because
it
was
his
habit
to
warm
the
study
during
the
winter
months
there
was
no
reason
why
spencer
should
light
the
on
an
afternoon
in
the
summer
term
when
the
thermometer
was
in
the
eighties
spencer
thought
he
might
want
some
muffins
cooked
for
tea
did
he
kennedy
earnestly
advised
spencer
to
give
up
thinking
as
nature
had
not
equipped
him
for
the
strain
thinking
necessitated
mental
effort
and
spencer
in
kennedy
opinion
had
no
mind
but
rubbed
along
on
a
cheap
substitute
of
mud
and
putty
more
chatty
remarks
were
exchanged
and
then
spencer
tore
himself
away
from
the
pleasant
interview
and
went
downstairs
to
the
junior
study
where
he
remarked
to
his
friend
phipps
that
life
was
getting
a
bit
thick
what
up
now
inquired
phipps
everything
we
just
had
a
week
of
term
and
i
been
in
extra
once
already
for
doing
practically
nothing
and
i
got
a
hundred
lines
and
kennedy
been
slanging
me
for
lighting
the
stove
how
was
i
to
know
he
did
want
it
lit
wish
i
was
fagging
for
somebody
else
all
the
while
you
jawing
said
phipps
there
a
letter
for
you
on
the
mantelpiece
staring
at
you
so
there
is
hullo
what
up
hullo
is
that
a
postal
order
how
much
for
five
bob
i
say
who
shearne
new
kid
in
blackburn
why
great
scott
i
remember
now
they
told
me
to
look
after
him
i
have
seen
him
yet
and
listen
to
this
shearne
has
sent
me
the
enclosed
to
give
to
you
her
son
writes
to
say
that
he
is
very
happy
and
getting
on
very
well
so
she
is
sure
you
must
have
been
looking
after
him
why
i
do
know
the
kid
by
sight
i
clean
forgot
all
about
him
well
you
better
go
and
see
him
now
just
to
say
you
done
it
spencer
perpended
beastly
nuisance
having
a
new
kid
hanging
on
to
you
he
probably
a
frightful
rotter
well
anyway
you
ought
to
said
phipps
who
possessed
the
of
a
conscience
i
ca
all
right
do
then
but
you
ought
to
send
back
that
postal
order
look
here
phipps
said
spencer
plaintively
you
need
be
an
idiot
you
know
and
the
trivial
matter
of
thomas
b
shearne
was
shelved
thomas
as
he
had
stated
in
his
letter
to
his
mother
was
exceedingly
happy
at
eckleton
and
getting
on
very
nicely
indeed
it
is
true
that
there
had
been
one
or
two
small
unpleasantnesses
at
first
but
those
were
over
now
and
he
had
settled
down
completely
the
little
troubles
alluded
to
above
had
begun
on
his
second
day
at
blackburn
thomas
as
the
reader
may
have
gathered
from
his
glimpse
of
him
at
the
station
was
not
a
diffident
youth
he
was
quite
prepared
for
anything
fate
might
have
up
its
sleeve
for
him
and
he
entered
the
junior
at
blackburn
ready
for
emergencies
on
the
first
day
nothing
happened
one
or
two
people
asked
him
his
name
but
none
inquired
what
his
father
was
a
question
which
he
had
understood
from
books
of
school
life
was
invariably
put
to
the
new
boy
he
was
thus
prevented
from
replying
coolly
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
questioner
a
gentleman
yours
and
this
of
course
had
been
a
disappointment
but
he
reconciled
himself
to
it
and
on
the
whole
enjoyed
his
first
day
at
eckleton
on
the
second
there
occurred
an
episode
thomas
had
inherited
from
his
mother
a
pleasant
rather
meek
cast
of
countenance
he
had
pink
cheeks
and
golden
hair
almost
indecently
golden
in
one
who
was
not
a
choirboy
now
if
you
are
going
to
look
like
a
ministering
child
or
a
little
willie
the
sunbeam
of
the
home
when
you
go
to
a
public
school
you
must
take
the
consequences
as
thomas
sat
by
the
window
of
the
junior
reading
a
magazine
and
deeply
interested
in
it
there
fell
upon
his
face
such
a
rapt
angelic
expression
that
the
sight
of
it
silhouetted
against
the
window
roused
master
burge
his
as
it
had
been
a
to
seize
a
bradley
arnold
latin
prose
exercises
and
hurl
it
across
the
room
was
with
master
burge
the
work
of
a
moment
it
struck
thomas
on
the
ear
he
jumped
and
turned
some
shades
pinker
then
he
put
down
his
magazine
picked
up
the
bradley
arnold
and
sat
on
it
after
which
he
resumed
his
magazine
the
acute
interest
of
the
junior
always
fond
of
a
break
in
the
monotony
of
things
induced
burge
to
go
further
into
the
matter
you
with
the
face
said
burge
rudely
thomas
looked
up
what
the
dickens
are
you
going
with
my
book
pass
it
back
oh
is
this
yours
said
thomas
here
you
are
he
walked
towards
him
carrying
the
book
at
two
yards
range
he
fired
it
in
it
hit
burge
with
some
force
in
the
waistcoat
and
there
was
a
pause
while
he
collected
his
wind
then
the
thing
may
be
said
to
have
begun
yes
said
burge
interrogated
on
the
point
five
minutes
later
he
had
enough
good
said
thomas
pleasantly
want
a
handkerchief
that
evening
he
wrote
to
his
mother
and
thanking
her
for
kind
inquiries
stated
that
he
was
not
being
bullied
he
added
also
in
answer
to
inquiries
that
he
had
not
been
tossed
in
a
blanket
and
that
so
far
no
hulking
senior
with
scowl
had
let
him
down
from
the
dormitory
window
after
midnight
by
a
sheet
in
order
that
he
might
procure
gin
from
the
local
as
far
as
he
could
gather
the
seniors
were
mostly
teetotallers
yes
he
had
seen
spencer
several
times
he
did
not
add
that
he
had
seen
him
from
a
distance
i
so
glad
i
asked
davy
to
get
her
nephew
to
look
after
tom
said
shearne
concluding
the
reading
of
the
epistle
at
breakfast
it
makes
such
a
difference
to
a
new
boy
having
somebody
to
protect
him
at
first
only
drawback
is
said
his
eldest
brother
gloomily
wo
get
cheek
knocked
out
of
him
tom
kid
be
no
holding
him
and
he
helped
himself
to
marmalade
of
which
delicacy
his
mouth
was
full
with
a
sort
of
magnificent
despondency
by
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
of
his
school
career
thomas
beauchamp
algernon
had
overcome
all
the
little
ruggednesses
which
relieve
the
path
of
the
new
boy
from
monotony
he
had
been
taken
in
by
a
primaeval
sell
which
the
junior
invariably
sprang
on
the
but
as
he
had
sat
on
the
head
of
the
engineer
of
the
same
for
the
space
of
ten
minutes
despite
the
latter
complaints
of
pain
and
forecasts
of
what
he
would
do
when
he
got
up
the
laugh
had
not
been
completely
against
him
he
had
received
the
honourable
distinction
of
extra
lesson
for
ragging
in
french
he
had
been
touched
up
by
the
prefect
of
his
dormitory
for
creating
a
disturbance
in
the
small
hours
in
fact
he
had
gone
through
all
the
usual
preliminaries
and
become
a
eckletonian
his
letters
home
were
so
cheerful
at
this
point
that
a
second
postal
order
relieved
the
dwindling
fortune
of
spencer
and
it
was
this
coupled
with
the
remonstrances
of
phipps
that
induced
the
dencroftian
to
break
through
his
icy
reserve
look
here
spencer
said
phipps
his
conscience
thoroughly
stirred
by
this
second
windfall
it
all
rot
you
must
either
send
back
that
postal
order
or
go
and
see
the
chap
besides
he
quite
a
decent
kid
we
in
the
same
game
at
cricket
he
rather
a
good
bowler
getting
to
know
him
quite
well
i
got
a
jolly
sight
more
right
to
those
postal
orders
than
you
have
but
he
an
awful
ass
to
look
at
pleaded
spencer
what
wrong
with
him
does
look
nearly
such
a
goat
as
you
said
phipps
with
the
refreshing
directness
of
youth
he
got
yellow
hair
argued
spencer
why
should
he
have
he
looks
like
a
sort
of
young
kid
well
he
jolly
well
is
then
because
i
happen
to
know
that
had
scraps
with
some
of
the
fellows
in
his
house
and
simply
mopped
them
well
all
right
then
said
spencer
reluctantly
the
historic
meeting
took
place
outside
the
school
shop
at
the
quarter
to
eleven
interval
next
morning
thomas
was
leaning
against
the
wall
eating
a
bun
spencer
approached
him
with
half
a
jam
sandwich
in
his
hand
there
was
an
awkward
pause
hullo
said
spencer
at
last
hullo
said
thomas
spencer
finished
his
sandwich
and
brushed
the
crumbs
off
his
trousers
thomas
continued
operations
on
the
bun
with
the
concentrated
expression
of
a
lunching
python
i
believe
your
people
know
my
people
said
spencer
we
have
some
awfully
swell
friends
said
thomas
spencer
chewed
this
thoughtfully
awhile
beastly
cheek
he
said
at
last
sorry
said
thomas
not
looking
it
spencer
produced
a
bag
of
gelatines
have
one
he
asked
what
wrong
with
all
right
do
he
selected
a
gelatine
and
consumed
it
ever
had
your
head
smacked
he
inquired
courteously
a
slightly
strained
look
came
into
thomas
blue
eyes
not
often
he
replied
politely
why
oh
i
do
know
said
spencer
i
was
only
wondering
oh
look
here
said
spencer
my
mater
told
me
to
look
after
you
well
you
can
look
after
me
now
if
you
want
to
because
i
going
and
thomas
dissolved
the
meeting
by
walking
off
in
the
direction
of
the
junior
block
that
kid
said
spencer
to
his
immortal
soul
wants
his
head
smacked
badly
at
lunch
phipps
had
questions
to
ask
saw
you
talking
to
shearne
in
the
interval
he
said
what
were
you
talking
about
oh
nothing
in
particular
what
did
you
think
of
him
little
idiot
ask
him
to
tea
this
afternoon
no
you
must
dash
it
all
you
must
do
something
for
him
you
had
ten
bob
out
of
his
people
spencer
made
no
reply
going
to
the
school
shop
that
afternoon
he
found
thomas
seated
there
with
phipps
behind
a
pot
of
tea
as
a
rule
he
and
phipps
together
and
he
resented
this
desertion
come
on
said
phipps
we
were
waiting
for
you
pining
away
added
thomas
unnecessarily
spencer
frowned
austerely
come
and
look
after
me
urged
thomas
spencer
sat
down
in
silence
for
a
minute
no
sound
could
be
heard
but
the
champing
of
thomas
jaws
as
he
dealt
with
a
slab
of
gingerbread
buck
up
said
phipps
uneasily
give
me
said
thomas
just
one
loving
look
spencer
ignored
the
request
the
silence
became
tense
once
more
coming
to
the
house
net
phipps
asked
spencer
we
were
going
to
the
baths
why
do
you
come
all
right
said
spencer
doctors
tell
us
that
we
should
allow
one
hour
to
elapse
between
taking
food
and
bathing
but
the
rule
was
not
rigidly
adhered
to
at
eckleton
the
three
proceeded
straight
from
the
to
the
baths
the
place
was
rather
empty
when
they
arrived
it
was
a
little
earlier
than
the
majority
of
eckletonians
bathed
the
bath
filled
up
as
drew
near
with
the
exception
of
a
couple
of
infants
splashing
about
in
the
shallow
end
and
a
stout
youth
who
dived
in
from
the
scrambled
out
and
dived
in
again
each
time
flatter
than
the
last
they
had
the
place
to
themselves
what
it
like
gorrick
inquired
phipps
of
the
stout
youth
who
had
just
appeared
above
the
surface
again
blowing
like
a
whale
the
question
was
rendered
necessary
by
the
fact
that
many
years
before
the
boiler
at
the
eckleton
baths
had
burst
and
had
never
been
repaired
with
the
consequence
that
the
temperature
of
the
water
was
apt
to
vary
that
is
to
say
most
days
it
was
colder
than
others
simply
boiling
said
the
man
of
weight
climbing
out
i
say
did
i
go
in
all
right
then
not
bad
said
phipps
bit
flat
added
thomas
critically
gorrick
blinked
severely
at
the
speaker
a
at
a
fashionable
restaurant
is
cordial
in
his
manner
compared
with
a
boy
who
has
been
at
a
public
school
a
year
when
addressed
familiarly
by
a
new
boy
after
reflecting
on
the
outrage
for
a
moment
he
dived
in
again
worse
than
ever
said
truthful
thomas
look
here
said
gorrick
oh
come
exclaimed
phipps
and
led
thomas
away
that
kid
said
gorrick
to
spencer
wants
his
head
smacked
badly
that
just
what
i
say
agreed
spencer
with
the
eagerness
of
a
great
mind
which
has
found
another
that
thinks
alike
with
itself
spencer
was
the
first
of
the
trio
ready
to
enter
the
water
his
movements
were
wary
and
deliberate
there
was
nothing
of
the
professional
diver
about
spencer
first
he
stood
on
the
edge
and
rubbed
his
arms
regarding
the
green
water
beneath
with
suspicion
and
dislike
then
crouching
down
he
inserted
three
toes
of
his
left
foot
drew
them
back
sharply
and
said
oo
then
he
stood
up
again
his
next
move
was
to
slap
his
chest
and
dance
a
few
steps
after
which
he
put
his
right
foot
into
the
water
again
remarked
oo
and
resumed
position
i
thought
you
said
it
was
warm
he
shouted
to
gorrick
so
it
is
hot
as
anything
come
on
in
and
spencer
came
on
in
not
because
he
wanted
to
for
by
rights
there
were
some
twelve
more
movements
to
be
gone
through
before
he
should
finally
creep
in
at
the
shallow
end
but
because
a
cold
hand
placed
suddenly
on
the
small
of
his
back
urged
him
forward
down
he
went
with
the
water
fizzing
and
bubbling
all
over
and
all
round
him
he
swallowed
a
good
deal
of
it
but
there
was
still
plenty
left
and
what
there
was
was
colder
than
one
would
have
believed
possible
he
came
to
the
surface
after
what
seemed
to
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
struck
out
for
the
side
when
he
got
out
phipps
and
thomas
had
just
got
in
gorrick
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
cocoanut
matting
which
formed
a
pathway
to
the
gorrick
was
blue
but
determined
i
say
did
i
go
in
all
right
then
inquired
gorrick
how
the
dickens
do
i
know
said
spencer
stung
to
fresh
wrath
by
the
inanity
of
the
question
spencer
did
said
thomas
appearing
in
the
water
below
them
and
holding
on
to
the
rail
look
here
cried
spencer
did
you
shove
me
in
then
me
shove
thomas
voice
expressed
horror
and
pain
why
you
dived
in
jolly
good
one
too
reminded
me
of
the
diving
elephants
at
the
hippodrome
and
he
swam
off
that
kid
said
gorrick
gazing
after
him
wants
his
head
smacked
badly
agreed
spencer
look
here
did
he
shove
me
in
did
you
see
him
i
was
doing
my
dive
but
it
must
have
been
him
phipps
never
rags
in
the
bath
spencer
grunted
an
expressive
grunt
and
creeping
down
the
steps
entered
the
water
again
it
was
spencer
ambition
to
swim
ten
lengths
of
the
bath
he
was
not
a
young
channel
swimmer
and
ten
lengths
represented
a
very
respectable
distance
to
him
he
proceeded
now
to
attempt
to
lower
his
record
it
was
not
often
that
he
got
the
bath
so
much
to
himself
usually
there
was
barely
in
the
water
and
swimming
was
impossible
but
now
with
a
clear
field
he
should
he
thought
be
able
to
complete
the
desired
distance
he
was
beginning
the
fifth
length
before
interruption
came
just
as
he
reached
halfway
a
reproachful
voice
at
his
side
said
oh
percy
you
tire
yourself
and
a
hand
on
the
top
of
his
head
propelled
him
firmly
towards
the
bottom
every
schoolboy
as
honble
macaulay
would
have
put
it
knows
the
sensation
of
being
ducked
it
is
always
unpleasant
sometimes
more
sometimes
less
the
present
case
belonged
to
the
former
class
there
was
just
room
inside
spencer
for
another
of
water
he
swallowed
it
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
swam
to
the
side
without
a
word
and
climbed
out
it
was
the
last
straw
honour
could
now
be
satisfied
only
with
gore
he
hung
about
outside
the
baths
till
phipps
and
thomas
appeared
then
with
a
steadfast
expression
on
his
face
he
walked
up
to
the
latter
and
kicked
him
thomas
seemed
surprised
but
not
alarmed
his
eyes
grew
a
little
rounder
and
the
pink
on
his
cheeks
deepened
he
looked
like
a
in
a
bad
temper
hullo
what
up
you
ass
spencer
inquired
phipps
spencer
said
nothing
where
shall
we
go
asked
thomas
oh
chuck
it
said
phipps
the
peacemaker
spencer
and
thomas
were
eyeing
each
other
warily
you
chaps
are
going
to
fight
said
phipps
the
notion
seemed
to
distress
him
unless
he
cares
to
take
a
kicking
said
spencer
suavely
not
i
think
thanks
replied
thomas
without
heat
then
look
here
said
phipps
briskly
i
know
a
ripping
little
place
just
off
the
lelby
road
it
is
five
minutes
walk
and
there
no
chance
of
being
booked
there
rot
if
someone
was
to
come
and
stop
it
through
it
in
a
field
thick
hedges
no
one
can
see
and
i
tell
you
what
i
keep
time
i
got
a
watch
two
minute
rounds
and
in
between
and
i
the
referee
so
if
anybody
fouls
the
other
chap
i
stop
the
fight
see
come
on
of
the
details
of
that
conflict
we
have
no
very
clear
record
phipps
is
enthusiastic
but
vague
he
speaks
in
eulogistic
terms
of
a
corker
which
spencer
brought
off
in
the
second
round
and
again
of
a
tremendous
biff
which
thomas
appears
to
have
consummated
in
the
fourth
but
of
the
more
subtle
points
of
the
fighting
he
is
content
merely
to
state
comprehensively
that
they
were
as
to
the
result
it
would
seem
that
in
the
capacity
of
referee
he
declared
the
affair
a
draw
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
round
and
later
in
his
capacity
of
second
to
both
parties
helped
his
principals
home
by
back
and
secret
ways
one
on
each
arm
the
next
items
to
which
the
chronicler
would
call
the
attention
of
the
reader
are
two
letters
the
first
was
from
shearne
to
spencer
and
ran
as
follows
my
dear
spencer
i
am
writing
to
you
direct
instead
of
through
your
aunt
because
i
want
to
thank
you
so
much
for
looking
after
my
boy
so
well
i
know
what
a
hard
time
a
new
boy
has
at
a
public
school
if
he
has
got
nobody
to
take
care
of
him
at
first
i
heard
from
tom
this
morning
he
seems
so
happy
and
so
fond
of
you
he
says
you
are
an
awfully
decent
chap
and
the
only
chap
who
has
stood
up
to
him
at
all
i
suppose
he
means
for
him
i
hope
you
will
come
and
spend
part
of
your
holidays
with
us
catch
said
spencer
sincerely
i
hope
you
will
manage
to
buy
something
nice
with
the
enclosed
the
enclosed
was
yet
another
postal
order
for
five
shillings
as
somebody
wisely
observed
a
woman
is
always
the
most
important
part
of
her
letter
that
kid
murmured
spencer
between
swollen
lips
has
got
cheek
enough
for
eighteen
decent
chap
he
proceeded
to
compose
a
letter
in
reply
and
for
dignity
combined
with
lucidity
it
may
stand
as
a
model
to
young
writers
college
grounds
spencer
begs
to
present
his
compliments
to
shearne
and
returns
the
postal
order
because
he
does
see
why
he
should
have
it
he
notes
your
remarks
my
being
a
decent
chap
in
your
favour
of
the
but
can
not
see
where
it
quite
comes
in
as
the
only
thing
i
done
to
shearne
son
is
to
fight
seven
rounds
with
him
in
a
field
phipps
refereeing
it
was
a
draw
i
got
a
black
eye
and
rather
a
whack
in
the
mouth
but
gave
him
beans
also
particularly
in
the
wind
which
i
learned
to
do
from
reading
rodney
stone
the
bit
where
bob
whittaker
beats
the
eyetalian
gondoleery
cove
hoping
that
this
will
be
taken
in
the
spirit
which
is
meant
sincerely
he
sent
this
off
after
and
retired
to
bed
full
of
spiritual
pride
on
the
following
morning
going
to
the
shop
during
the
interval
he
came
upon
thomas
negotiating
a
hot
bun
hullo
said
thomas
as
was
generally
the
case
after
he
had
had
a
fair
and
spirited
with
a
fellow
human
being
thomas
had
begun
to
feel
that
he
loved
his
late
adversary
as
a
brother
a
wholesome
respect
which
had
hitherto
been
wanting
formed
part
of
his
opinion
of
him
hullo
said
spencer
pausing
i
say
said
thomas
what
up
i
say
i
do
believe
we
shook
hands
did
we
i
do
remember
doing
it
they
shook
hands
spencer
began
to
feel
that
there
were
points
about
thomas
after
all
i
say
said
thomas
hullo
i
sorry
about
in
the
bath
you
know
i
did
know
you
minded
being
ducked
oh
all
right
said
spencer
awkwardly
eight
bars
rest
i
say
said
thomas
hullo
doing
anything
this
afternoon
nothing
special
why
come
and
have
tea
all
right
thanks
i
wait
for
you
outside
the
house
all
right
it
was
just
here
that
spencer
regretted
that
he
had
sent
back
that
postal
order
five
good
shillings
simply
chucked
away
oh
life
life
but
they
were
not
after
all
on
his
plate
at
breakfast
next
day
spencer
found
a
letter
this
was
the
letter
shearne
father
of
b
shearne
and
shearne
brother
of
same
beg
to
acknowledge
receipt
of
esteemed
communication
of
yesterday
date
and
in
reply
desire
to
inform
spencer
of
their
hearty
approval
of
his
attentions
to
b
shearne
wind
it
is
their
opinion
that
the
above
a
nice
boy
but
inclined
to
cheek
badly
needs
treatment
on
these
lines
occasionally
they
therefore
beg
to
return
the
postal
order
together
with
another
for
a
like
sum
and
trust
that
this
will
meet
with
spencer
approval
signed
shearne
two
enclosures
of
course
what
up
really
said
spencer
to
himself
after
reading
this
is
that
the
whole
family
jolly
well
cracked
his
eye
fell
on
the
postal
orders
still
he
said
that
evening
he
entertained
phipps
and
thomas
b
shearne
lavishly
at
tea
a
corner
in
lines
of
all
the
useless
and
irritating
things
in
this
world
lines
are
probably
the
most
useless
and
the
most
irritating
in
fact
i
only
know
of
two
people
who
ever
got
any
good
out
of
them
dunstable
of
day
was
one
linton
of
seymour
the
other
for
a
portion
of
one
winter
term
they
flourished
on
lines
the
more
there
were
set
the
better
they
liked
it
they
would
have
been
disappointed
if
masters
had
given
up
the
habit
of
doling
them
out
dunstable
was
a
youth
of
ideas
he
saw
far
more
possibilities
in
the
routine
of
life
at
locksley
than
did
the
majority
of
his
contemporaries
and
every
now
and
then
he
made
use
of
these
possibilities
in
a
way
that
caused
a
considerable
sensation
in
the
school
in
the
ordinary
way
of
school
work
however
he
was
not
particularly
brilliant
and
suffered
in
consequence
his
chief
foe
was
his
langridge
the
feud
between
them
had
begun
on
dunstable
arrival
in
the
form
two
terms
before
and
had
continued
ever
since
the
balance
of
points
lay
with
the
master
the
staff
has
ways
of
scoring
which
the
school
has
not
this
story
really
begins
with
the
last
day
but
one
of
the
summer
term
it
happened
that
dunstable
people
were
going
to
make
their
annual
migration
to
scotland
on
that
day
and
the
headmaster
approached
on
the
subject
both
by
letter
and
in
person
saw
no
reason
why
the
examinations
being
over
dunstable
should
not
leave
locksley
a
day
before
the
end
of
term
he
called
dunstable
to
his
study
one
night
after
preparation
your
father
has
written
to
me
dunstable
he
said
to
ask
that
you
may
be
allowed
to
go
home
on
wednesday
instead
of
thursday
i
think
that
under
the
special
circumstances
there
will
be
no
objection
to
this
you
had
better
see
that
the
matron
packs
your
boxes
yes
sir
said
dunstable
good
business
he
added
to
himself
as
he
left
the
room
when
he
got
back
to
his
own
den
he
began
to
ponder
over
the
matter
to
see
if
something
could
not
be
made
out
of
it
that
was
way
he
never
let
anything
drop
until
he
had
made
certain
that
he
had
exhausted
all
its
possibilities
just
before
he
went
to
bed
he
had
evolved
a
neat
little
scheme
for
scoring
off
langridge
the
knowledge
of
his
plans
was
confined
to
himself
and
the
headmaster
his
would
imagine
that
he
was
going
to
stay
on
till
the
last
day
of
term
therefore
if
he
misbehaved
himself
in
form
langridge
would
set
him
lines
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
he
would
not
be
there
next
day
to
show
them
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
term
moreover
he
would
not
be
in
langridge
form
for
he
was
certain
of
his
move
up
he
acted
accordingly
he
spent
the
earlier
part
of
wednesday
morning
in
breaches
of
the
peace
langridge
instead
of
pulling
him
up
put
him
on
to
translate
dunstable
went
on
to
translate
as
he
had
not
prepared
the
lesson
and
was
not
an
adept
at
construing
unseen
his
performance
was
poor
after
a
minute
and
a
half
the
wearied
have
you
looked
at
this
dunstable
he
asked
there
was
a
answer
to
this
question
yes
sir
he
said
ethics
do
not
demand
that
you
should
reply
truthfully
to
the
spirit
of
a
question
the
letter
of
it
is
all
that
requires
attention
dunstable
had
at
the
lesson
he
was
looking
at
it
then
masters
should
practise
exactness
of
speech
a
certain
form
at
harrow
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
across
a
copy
of
a
latin
author
before
they
could
then
say
with
truth
that
they
had
been
over
it
this
is
not
an
isolated
case
go
on
said
langridge
dunstable
smiled
as
he
did
so
langridge
was
annoyed
what
are
you
laughing
at
what
do
you
mean
by
it
stand
up
you
will
write
out
the
lesson
in
latin
and
english
and
show
it
up
to
me
by
four
this
afternoon
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
you
imagine
that
because
this
is
the
end
of
the
term
you
can
do
as
you
please
but
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
mind
by
four
at
four
dunstable
was
enjoying
an
excellent
tea
in
green
street
park
lane
and
telling
his
mother
that
he
had
had
a
most
enjoyable
term
marred
by
no
unpleasantness
whatever
his
holidays
were
sweetened
by
the
thought
of
langridge
baffled
wrath
on
discovering
the
true
inwardness
of
the
recent
episode
when
he
returned
to
locksley
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
term
he
was
at
once
made
aware
that
that
episode
was
not
to
be
considered
closed
on
the
first
evening
day
his
housemaster
sent
for
him
well
dunstable
he
said
where
is
that
imposition
dunstable
affected
ignorance
please
sir
you
set
me
no
imposition
no
dunstable
no
day
peered
at
him
gravely
through
his
spectacles
set
you
no
imposition
but
langridge
did
dunstable
imitated
that
eminent
tactician
rabbit
he
lay
low
and
said
nuffin
surely
continued
day
in
tones
of
mild
reproach
you
did
not
think
that
you
could
take
langridge
in
dunstable
rather
thought
he
taken
langridge
in
but
he
made
no
reply
well
said
day
i
must
set
you
some
punishment
i
shall
give
the
butler
instructions
to
hand
you
a
note
from
me
at
three
the
next
day
was
a
in
that
note
you
will
find
indicated
what
i
wish
you
to
write
out
why
this
business
dunstable
wondered
then
it
dawned
upon
him
day
wished
to
break
up
his
thoroughly
that
afternoon
dunstable
retired
in
disgust
to
his
study
to
brood
over
his
wrongs
to
him
entered
charles
his
friend
one
linton
to
wit
of
seymour
a
very
hearty
sportsman
good
said
linton
did
think
i
should
find
you
in
thought
you
might
have
gone
off
somewhere
as
it
such
a
ripping
day
tell
you
what
we
do
scull
a
mile
or
two
up
the
river
and
have
tea
somewhere
i
should
like
to
awfully
said
dunstable
but
i
afraid
i
ca
and
he
explained
day
ingenious
scheme
for
preventing
him
from
straying
that
afternoon
rot
is
it
he
said
beastly
would
have
thought
old
day
had
it
in
him
but
i
tell
you
what
he
said
do
the
impot
now
and
then
you
be
able
to
start
at
three
sharp
and
we
shall
get
in
a
good
time
on
the
river
day
always
sets
the
same
thing
i
known
scores
of
chaps
get
impots
from
him
and
they
all
had
to
do
the
greek
numerals
he
mad
on
the
greek
numerals
never
does
anything
else
you
be
as
safe
as
anything
if
you
do
them
buck
up
i
help
they
accordingly
sat
down
there
and
then
by
three
an
imposing
array
of
sheets
of
foolscap
covered
with
greek
lay
on
the
study
table
that
ought
to
be
enough
said
linton
laying
down
his
pen
he
set
you
more
than
we
done
i
should
think
rummy
how
alike
our
writing
looks
said
dunstable
collecting
the
sheets
and
examining
them
you
can
hardly
tell
which
is
which
even
when
you
know
well
there
goes
three
my
watch
is
slow
as
it
always
is
i
go
and
get
that
note
two
minutes
later
he
returned
full
of
abusive
references
to
day
the
crafty
pedagogue
appeared
to
have
foreseen
dunstable
attempt
to
circumvent
him
by
doing
the
greek
numerals
on
the
chance
of
his
setting
them
the
imposition
he
had
set
in
his
note
was
ten
pages
of
irregular
verbs
and
they
were
to
be
shown
up
in
his
study
before
five
linton
programme
for
the
afternoon
was
out
of
the
question
now
but
he
loyally
gave
up
any
other
plans
which
he
might
have
formed
in
order
to
help
dunstable
with
his
irregular
verbs
dunstable
was
too
disgusted
with
fate
to
be
properly
grateful
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
said
as
they
adjourned
for
tea
at
four
having
deposited
the
verbs
on
day
table
that
all
those
numerals
will
be
wasted
now
i
should
keep
them
though
said
linton
they
may
come
in
useful
you
never
know
towards
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
term
fate
by
way
of
compensation
allowed
dunstable
a
distinct
stroke
of
luck
forman
the
master
of
his
new
form
set
him
a
hundred
lines
of
virgil
and
told
him
to
show
them
up
next
day
to
dunstable
delight
the
next
day
passed
without
mention
of
them
and
when
the
day
after
that
went
by
and
still
nothing
was
said
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
forman
had
forgotten
all
about
them
which
was
indeed
the
case
forman
was
engaged
in
editing
a
new
edition
of
the
bacchae
and
was
apt
to
be
in
consequence
so
dunstable
with
a
glad
smile
hove
the
lines
into
a
cupboard
in
his
study
to
keep
company
with
the
greek
numerals
which
he
had
done
for
day
and
went
out
to
play
fives
with
linton
linton
curiously
enough
had
also
had
a
stroke
of
luck
in
a
rather
similar
way
he
told
dunstable
about
it
as
they
strolled
back
to
the
houses
after
their
game
bit
of
luck
this
afternoon
he
said
you
remember
appleby
setting
me
a
the
day
before
yesterday
well
i
showed
them
up
and
he
looked
through
them
and
chucked
them
into
the
basket
under
his
desk
i
thought
at
the
time
i
had
seen
him
muck
them
up
at
all
with
his
pencil
which
is
his
usual
game
so
after
he
had
gone
at
the
end
of
school
i
nipped
to
the
basket
and
fished
them
out
they
were
as
good
as
new
so
i
saved
them
up
in
case
i
get
any
more
dunstable
hastened
to
tell
of
his
own
good
fortune
linton
was
impressed
by
the
coincidence
i
tell
you
what
he
said
we
score
either
way
because
if
we
never
get
any
more
lines
dunstable
laughed
yes
i
know
linton
went
on
we
bound
to
but
even
supposing
we
do
what
we
got
in
stock
need
be
wasted
i
do
see
that
said
dunstable
going
to
have
bound
in
cloth
and
published
or
were
you
thinking
of
framing
them
why
do
you
see
sell
them
of
course
there
are
dozens
of
chaps
in
the
school
who
would
be
glad
of
a
few
hundred
lines
cheap
it
would
work
they
be
spotted
rot
it
been
done
before
and
nobody
said
anything
a
chap
in
seymour
who
left
last
easter
sold
all
his
stock
lines
by
auction
on
the
last
day
of
term
they
were
virgil
mostly
and
greek
numerals
they
sold
like
hot
cakes
there
were
about
five
hundred
of
them
altogether
and
i
happen
to
know
that
every
word
of
them
has
been
given
up
and
passed
all
right
well
i
shall
keep
mine
said
dunstable
i
am
sure
to
want
all
the
lines
in
stock
that
i
can
get
i
used
to
think
langridge
was
fairly
bad
in
the
way
of
impots
but
forman
takes
the
biscuit
easily
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
hobby
of
his
you
ca
stop
him
but
it
was
not
until
the
middle
of
preparation
that
the
great
idea
flashed
upon
dunstable
mind
it
was
the
simplicity
of
the
thing
that
took
his
breath
away
that
and
its
possibilities
this
was
the
idea
why
not
start
a
lines
trust
in
the
school
an
agency
for
supplying
lines
at
moderate
rates
to
all
who
desired
them
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
single
flaw
in
the
scheme
he
and
linton
between
them
could
turn
out
enough
material
in
a
week
to
give
the
trust
a
good
working
capital
and
as
for
the
risk
of
detection
when
customers
came
to
show
up
the
goods
supplied
to
them
that
was
very
slight
as
has
been
pointed
out
before
there
was
practically
one
handwriting
common
to
the
whole
school
when
it
came
to
writing
lines
it
resembled
the
movements
of
a
fly
that
had
fallen
into
an
and
subsequently
taken
a
little
brisk
exercise
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
by
way
of
restoring
the
circulation
then
again
the
attitude
of
the
master
to
whom
the
lines
were
shown
was
not
likely
to
be
critical
so
that
everything
seemed
in
favour
of
scheme
linton
to
whom
he
confided
it
was
inclined
to
scoff
at
first
but
when
he
had
had
the
beauties
of
the
idea
explained
to
him
at
length
became
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
the
scheme
but
he
objected
it
take
up
all
our
time
is
it
worth
it
we
ca
spend
every
afternoon
sweating
away
at
impots
for
other
people
it
all
right
said
dunstable
i
thought
of
that
we
shall
need
to
pitch
in
pretty
hard
for
about
a
week
or
ten
days
that
will
give
us
a
good
big
stock
and
after
that
if
we
turn
out
a
hundred
each
every
day
it
will
be
all
right
a
hundred
not
much
fag
if
you
spread
them
over
a
day
linton
admitted
that
this
was
sound
and
the
locksley
lines
supplying
trust
set
to
work
in
earnest
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
agency
left
a
great
deal
to
chance
the
writing
of
lines
in
advance
may
seem
a
very
speculative
business
but
both
dunstable
and
linton
had
had
a
wide
experience
of
locksley
masters
and
the
methods
of
the
same
when
roused
and
they
were
thus
enabled
to
reduce
the
element
of
chance
to
a
minimum
they
knew
for
example
that
day
favourite
imposition
was
the
greek
numerals
and
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
that
would
be
what
the
youth
who
had
dealings
with
him
would
need
to
ask
for
from
the
lines
trust
appleby
on
the
other
hand
invariably
set
virgil
the
oldest
inhabitant
had
never
known
him
to
depart
from
this
custom
for
the
french
masters
extracts
from
the
works
of
victor
hugo
would
probably
pass
muster
a
week
from
the
date
of
the
above
conversation
everyone
in
the
school
with
the
exception
of
the
prefects
and
the
sixth
form
found
in
his
desk
on
arriving
at
his
a
printed
slip
of
paper
spiking
the
stationer
in
the
high
street
had
printed
it
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
prospectus
of
the
new
trust
it
set
forth
in
glowing
terms
the
advantages
offered
by
the
agency
dunstable
had
written
it
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
skill
with
his
pen
and
linton
had
suggested
subtle
and
captivating
additions
the
whole
presented
rather
a
striking
appearance
the
document
was
headed
with
the
name
of
the
trust
in
large
letters
under
this
came
a
number
of
scare
headlines
such
as
see
what
you
save
no
more
worry
peace
perfect
peace
why
do
lines
when
we
do
them
for
you
then
came
the
real
prospectus
the
locksley
lines
supplying
trust
has
been
instituted
to
meet
the
growing
demand
for
lines
and
other
impositions
while
there
are
masters
at
our
public
schools
there
will
always
be
lines
at
locksley
the
crop
of
masters
has
always
flourished
and
still
flourishes
very
rankly
and
the
demand
for
lines
has
greatly
taxed
the
powers
of
those
to
whom
has
been
assigned
the
task
of
supplying
them
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
affording
relief
to
these
that
the
lines
trust
has
been
formed
it
is
proposed
that
all
orders
for
lines
shall
be
supplied
out
of
our
vast
stock
our
charges
are
moderate
and
vary
between
threepence
and
sixpence
per
hundred
lines
the
higher
charge
is
made
for
greek
impositions
which
for
obvious
reasons
entail
a
greater
degree
of
labour
on
our
large
and
efficient
staff
of
writers
all
orders
which
will
be
promptly
executed
should
be
forwarded
to
dunstable
college
grounds
locksley
or
to
linton
college
grounds
locksley
must
be
inclosed
with
order
or
the
latter
will
not
be
under
no
conditions
will
notes
of
hand
or
cheques
be
accepted
as
legal
tender
there
is
no
trust
about
us
except
the
name
come
in
your
thousands
we
have
lines
for
all
if
the
stock
of
lines
were
to
be
placed
end
to
end
it
would
reach
part
of
the
way
to
london
you
pay
the
threepence
we
do
the
rest
then
a
blank
space
after
which
came
a
few
unsolicited
testimonials
lower
fifth
writes
i
was
set
two
hundred
lines
of
virgil
on
saturday
last
at
one
having
laid
in
a
supply
from
your
agency
i
was
enabled
to
show
them
up
at
five
minutes
past
one
the
master
who
gave
me
the
commission
was
unable
to
restrain
his
admiration
at
the
rapidity
and
neatness
of
my
work
you
may
make
what
use
of
this
you
please
dexter
house
writes
please
send
me
one
hundred
lines
from
book
dexter
was
so
delighted
with
the
last
i
showed
him
that
he
has
asked
me
to
do
some
more
enthusiast
writes
thank
you
for
your
greek
numerals
day
took
them
without
blinking
so
beautifully
were
they
executed
that
i
can
hardly
believe
even
now
that
i
did
not
write
them
myself
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
popularity
of
the
trust
it
caught
on
instantly
nothing
else
was
discussed
in
the
at
the
quarter
to
eleven
interval
and
in
the
houses
after
lunch
it
was
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
dunstable
and
linton
were
bombarded
with
questions
and
witticisms
of
the
near
personal
sort
to
the
latter
they
replied
with
directness
to
the
former
evasively
what
it
all
someone
would
ask
fluttering
the
leaflet
before
dunstable
unmoved
face
you
should
read
it
carefully
dunstable
would
reply
it
all
there
but
what
are
you
playing
at
we
tried
to
make
it
clear
to
the
meanest
intelligence
sorry
you
ca
understand
it
while
at
the
same
time
linton
in
his
would
be
explaining
to
excited
inquirers
that
he
was
sorry
but
it
was
impossible
to
reply
to
their
query
as
to
who
was
running
the
trust
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
reveal
business
secrets
suffice
it
that
there
the
lines
were
waiting
to
be
bought
and
he
was
there
to
sell
them
so
that
if
anybody
cared
to
lay
in
a
stock
large
or
small
according
to
taste
would
he
kindly
walk
up
and
deposit
the
necessary
coin
but
here
the
public
showed
an
unaccountable
disinclination
to
deal
it
was
gratifying
to
have
acquaintances
coming
up
and
saying
admiringly
you
are
an
ass
you
know
as
if
they
were
paying
the
highest
of
compliments
as
indeed
they
probably
imagined
that
they
were
all
this
was
magnificent
but
it
was
not
business
dunstable
and
linton
felt
that
the
whole
attitude
of
the
public
towards
the
new
enterprise
was
wrong
locksley
seemed
to
regard
the
trust
as
a
huge
joke
and
its
prospectus
as
a
literary
in
fact
it
looked
very
much
as
if
from
a
purely
commercial
point
of
view
the
great
lines
supplying
trust
was
going
to
be
what
is
known
in
theatrical
circles
as
a
frost
for
two
whole
days
the
public
refused
to
bite
and
dunstable
and
linton
turning
over
the
stacks
of
lines
in
their
studies
thought
gloomily
that
this
world
is
no
place
for
original
enterprise
then
things
began
to
move
it
was
quite
an
accident
that
started
them
jackson
of
dexter
was
teaing
with
linton
and
as
was
his
habit
was
giving
him
a
condensed
history
of
his
life
since
he
last
saw
him
in
the
course
of
this
he
touched
on
a
small
encounter
with
gaudinois
which
had
occurred
that
afternoon
so
i
got
two
pages
of
treize
to
write
he
concluded
for
doing
practically
nothing
all
jackson
impositions
according
to
him
were
given
him
for
doing
practically
nothing
now
and
then
he
got
them
for
doing
literally
nothing
when
he
ought
to
have
been
doing
done
asked
linton
not
yet
no
replied
jackson
more
tea
please
what
you
want
to
do
then
said
linton
is
to
apply
to
the
locksley
lines
supplying
trust
that
what
you
must
do
you
need
rot
a
chap
on
a
painful
subject
protested
jackson
i
was
rotting
said
linton
why
do
you
apply
to
the
lines
trust
then
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
really
is
such
a
thing
jackson
said
incredulously
why
i
thought
it
was
all
a
rag
i
know
you
did
it
the
rotten
sort
of
thing
you
would
think
rag
by
jove
look
at
this
now
do
you
understand
that
this
is
a
genuine
concern
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
cupboard
which
filled
the
space
between
the
stove
and
the
bookshelf
from
this
he
extracted
a
great
pile
of
manuscript
and
dumped
it
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
which
caused
a
good
deal
of
jackson
tea
to
spring
from
its
native
cup
on
to
its
owner
trousers
when
you
finished
protested
jackson
mopping
himself
with
a
handkerchief
that
had
seen
better
days
sorry
but
look
at
these
what
did
you
say
your
impot
was
oh
i
remember
here
you
are
two
pages
of
treize
i
know
which
two
pages
but
i
suppose
any
will
do
jackson
was
amazed
great
scott
what
a
wad
of
stuff
when
did
you
do
it
all
oh
at
odd
times
dunstable
got
just
as
much
over
at
day
so
you
see
the
trust
is
a
jolly
big
show
here
are
your
two
pages
that
looks
just
like
your
scrawl
does
it
these
would
be
fourpence
in
the
ordinary
way
but
you
can
have
for
nothing
this
time
oh
i
say
said
jackson
gratefully
that
awfully
good
of
you
after
that
the
locksley
lines
supplying
trust
went
ahead
with
a
rush
the
brilliant
success
which
attended
its
first
specimen
gaudinois
took
jackson
imposition
without
a
murmur
promoted
confidence
in
the
public
and
they
rushed
to
buy
orders
poured
in
from
all
the
houses
and
by
the
middle
of
the
term
the
organisers
of
the
scheme
were
able
to
divide
a
substantial
sum
how
are
you
getting
on
round
your
way
asked
linton
of
dunstable
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
of
term
ripping
selling
like
hot
cakes
so
are
mine
said
linton
i
almost
come
to
the
end
of
my
stock
i
ought
to
have
written
some
more
but
i
been
a
bit
slack
lately
yes
buck
up
we
must
keep
a
lot
in
hand
i
say
did
you
hear
that
about
merrett
in
our
house
asked
linton
what
about
him
why
he
tried
to
start
a
rival
show
wrote
a
prospectus
and
everything
but
it
did
catch
on
a
bit
the
only
chap
who
bought
any
of
his
lines
was
young
shoeblossom
he
wanted
a
couple
of
hundred
for
appleby
appleby
was
on
to
them
like
bricks
spotted
shoeblossom
had
written
them
and
asked
who
had
he
would
say
so
he
got
them
doubled
everyone
in
the
house
is
jolly
sick
with
merrett
they
think
he
ought
to
have
owned
up
did
that
smash
up
merrett
show
is
he
going
to
turn
out
any
more
rather
not
who
buy
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
lines
supplying
trust
if
merrett
had
not
received
this
crushing
blow
and
had
been
allowed
to
carry
on
a
rival
business
on
legitimate
lines
locksley
was
conservative
in
its
habits
and
would
probably
have
continued
to
support
the
old
firm
as
it
was
the
baffled
merrett
a
youth
of
vindictive
nature
brooded
over
his
defeat
and
presently
hit
upon
a
scheme
whereby
things
might
be
levelled
up
one
afternoon
shortly
before
dunstable
was
surprised
by
the
advent
of
linton
to
his
study
in
a
bruised
and
dishevelled
condition
one
of
his
expressive
eyes
was
closed
and
blackened
he
also
wore
what
is
known
in
ring
circles
as
a
thick
ear
what
on
earth
up
inquired
dunstable
amazed
at
these
phenomena
have
you
been
scrapping
yes
merrett
i
won
what
are
you
up
to
writing
lines
you
may
as
well
save
yourself
the
trouble
they
wo
be
any
good
dunstable
stared
the
trust
bust
said
linton
he
never
wasted
words
in
moments
of
emotion
what
was
what
i
said
that
beast
merrett
gave
the
show
away
what
did
he
do
surely
he
did
tell
a
master
well
he
did
the
next
thing
to
it
he
hauled
out
that
prospectus
and
started
reading
it
in
form
i
watched
him
do
it
he
kept
it
under
the
desk
and
made
a
foul
row
laughing
over
it
appleby
could
help
spotting
him
of
course
he
told
him
to
bring
him
what
he
was
reading
up
went
merrett
with
the
prospectus
was
appleby
sick
i
do
believe
he
was
really
at
least
he
laughed
when
he
read
the
thing
but
he
hauled
me
up
after
school
and
gave
me
a
long
jaw
and
made
me
take
all
the
lines
i
got
to
his
house
he
burnt
them
i
had
it
out
with
merrett
just
now
he
swears
he
did
mean
to
get
the
thing
spotted
but
i
knew
he
did
where
did
you
scrag
him
in
the
dormitory
he
chucked
it
after
the
third
round
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
shouted
dunstable
buxton
appeared
a
member
of
appleby
house
oh
dunstable
appleby
wants
to
see
you
all
right
said
dunstable
wearily
appleby
was
in
facetious
mood
he
chaffed
dunstable
genially
about
his
prospectus
and
admitted
that
it
had
amused
him
dunstable
smiled
without
enjoyment
it
was
a
good
thing
perhaps
that
appleby
saw
the
humorous
rather
than
the
lawless
side
of
the
trust
but
all
the
quips
in
the
world
could
not
save
that
institution
from
ruin
presently
appleby
manner
changed
i
am
a
funny
dog
i
know
he
seemed
to
say
but
duty
is
duty
and
must
be
done
how
many
lines
have
you
at
your
house
dunstable
he
asked
about
eight
hundred
sir
then
you
had
better
write
me
eight
hundred
lines
and
show
them
up
to
me
in
this
room
at
shall
we
say
at
ten
minutes
to
five
it
is
now
a
quarter
to
so
that
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
dunstable
went
and
returned
five
minutes
later
bearing
an
armful
of
manuscript
i
do
think
i
shall
need
to
count
them
said
appleby
kindly
take
them
in
batches
of
ten
sheets
and
tear
them
in
half
dunstable
yes
sir
the
last
sheet
fluttered
in
two
sections
into
the
surfeited
basket
it
an
awful
waste
sir
said
dunstable
regretfully
appleby
beamed
we
must
however
he
said
always
endeavour
to
look
on
the
bright
side
dunstable
the
writing
of
these
eight
hundred
lines
will
have
given
you
a
fine
grip
of
the
rhythm
of
virgil
the
splendid
prose
of
victor
hugo
and
the
unstudied
majesty
of
the
greek
numerals
dunstable
sir
said
the
president
of
the
locksley
lines
supplying
trust
ltd
the
autograph
hunters
dunstable
had
his
reasons
for
wishing
to
obtain
montagu
autograph
but
admiration
for
that
gentleman
novels
was
not
one
of
them
it
was
nothing
to
him
that
critics
considered
watson
one
of
the
most
remarkable
figures
in
english
literature
since
scott
if
you
had
told
him
of
this
he
would
merely
have
wondered
in
his
coarse
material
way
how
much
watson
gave
the
critics
for
saying
so
to
the
reviewer
of
the
the
great
man
latest
effort
the
soul
of
anthony
carrington
popgood
and
grooly
seemed
a
work
that
speaks
eloquently
in
every
line
of
a
genius
that
time
can
not
wither
nor
custom
stale
to
dunstable
who
got
it
out
of
the
school
library
where
it
had
been
placed
at
the
request
of
a
literary
prefect
and
read
the
first
eleven
pages
it
seemed
rot
and
he
said
as
much
to
the
librarian
on
returning
it
yet
he
was
very
anxious
to
get
the
novelist
autograph
the
fact
was
that
day
his
a
man
whose
private
life
was
in
other
ways
unstained
by
vicious
habits
collected
autographs
also
day
had
behaved
in
a
square
manner
towards
dunstable
on
several
occasions
in
the
past
and
dunstable
always
ready
to
punish
bad
behaviour
in
a
master
was
equally
anxious
to
reward
and
foster
any
good
trait
which
he
might
exhibit
on
the
occasion
of
the
announcement
that
watson
had
taken
the
big
white
house
near
chesterton
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
school
day
had
expressed
in
dunstable
hearing
a
wish
that
he
could
add
that
celebrity
signature
to
his
collection
dunstable
had
instantly
determined
to
play
the
part
of
a
benevolent
providence
he
would
get
the
autograph
and
present
it
to
the
as
who
should
say
see
what
comes
of
being
good
it
would
be
pleasant
to
observe
the
innocent
joy
of
the
recipient
his
triumph
and
his
amazement
at
the
donor
ingenuity
in
securing
the
treasure
a
touching
scene
well
worth
the
trouble
involved
in
the
quest
and
there
would
be
trouble
for
montagu
watson
was
notoriously
a
foe
to
the
his
curt
replies
signed
by
a
secretary
had
damped
the
ardour
of
scores
of
brave
men
and
more
or
less
fair
women
a
genuine
montagu
watson
was
a
prize
in
the
autograph
market
dunstable
was
a
man
of
action
when
mark
the
at
day
carried
his
burden
of
letters
to
the
post
that
evening
there
nestled
among
them
one
addressed
to
watson
the
white
house
chesterton
looking
at
it
casually
few
of
his
friends
would
have
recognised
dunstable
handwriting
for
it
had
seemed
good
to
that
man
of
guile
to
adopt
for
the
occasion
the
role
of
a
backward
youth
of
twelve
years
old
he
thought
tender
years
might
touch
heart
this
was
the
letter
i
am
only
a
littel
boy
but
i
think
your
books
ripping
i
often
wonder
how
you
think
of
it
all
will
you
please
send
me
your
ortograf
i
like
your
books
very
much
i
have
named
my
white
rabit
montagu
after
you
i
punched
jones
ii
in
the
eye
becos
he
did
like
your
books
i
have
spent
the
only
penny
i
have
on
the
stampe
for
this
letter
which
i
might
have
spent
on
tuck
i
want
to
be
like
maltby
in
the
soul
of
anthony
carrington
when
i
grow
up
sincere
dunstable
it
was
a
little
unfortunate
perhaps
that
he
selected
maltby
as
his
ideal
character
that
gentleman
was
considered
by
critics
a
masterly
portrait
of
the
cynical
but
it
was
the
only
name
he
remembered
hot
stuff
said
dunstable
to
himself
as
he
closed
the
envelope
little
beast
said
watson
to
himself
as
he
opened
it
it
arrived
by
the
morning
post
and
he
never
felt
really
himself
till
after
breakfast
here
morrison
he
said
to
his
secretary
later
in
the
morning
just
answer
this
will
you
the
usual
thing
thanks
and
most
deeply
grateful
next
day
the
following
was
included
in
dunstable
correspondence
montagu
watson
presents
his
compliments
to
dunstable
and
begs
to
thank
him
for
all
the
kind
things
he
says
about
his
work
in
his
letter
of
the
for
which
he
is
deeply
grateful
foiled
said
dunstable
and
went
off
to
seymour
to
see
his
friend
linton
got
any
notepaper
he
asked
heaps
said
linton
why
want
some
then
get
out
a
piece
i
want
to
dictate
a
letter
linton
stared
what
up
hurt
your
hand
dunstable
explained
day
collects
autographs
you
know
and
he
wants
montagu
badly
pining
away
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
wo
smile
until
he
gets
it
i
had
a
shot
at
it
yesterday
and
got
this
linton
inspected
the
document
so
i
ca
send
up
another
myself
you
see
why
worry
oh
i
like
to
put
day
one
up
he
not
been
bad
this
term
come
on
all
right
let
her
rip
dunstable
let
her
rip
i
can
not
refrain
from
writing
to
tell
you
what
an
inestimable
comfort
your
novels
have
been
to
me
during
years
of
sore
tribulation
and
distress
look
here
interrupted
linton
with
decision
at
this
point
if
you
think
i
going
to
shove
my
name
at
the
end
of
this
rot
you
making
the
mistake
of
a
lifetime
of
course
not
you
a
widow
who
has
lost
two
sons
in
south
africa
we
think
of
a
good
name
afterwards
ready
ever
since
my
darling
charles
herbert
and
percy
lionel
were
taken
from
me
in
that
dreadful
war
i
have
turned
for
consolation
to
the
pages
of
soul
of
anthony
carrington
and
what
another
asked
linton
there
one
called
sure
sounds
rummy
that
all
right
you
have
to
get
a
queer
title
nowadays
if
you
want
to
sell
a
book
go
on
then
jam
it
down
and
i
hate
to
bother
you
but
if
you
could
send
me
your
autograph
i
should
be
more
grateful
than
words
can
say
yours
admiringly
what
a
good
name
how
would
dorothy
maynard
do
you
want
something
more
aristocratic
what
price
hilda
dunstable
made
no
objection
and
linton
signed
the
letter
with
a
flourish
they
installed
at
spiking
in
the
high
street
it
was
not
a
very
likely
address
for
a
lady
whose
blood
was
presumably
of
the
bluest
but
they
could
think
of
none
except
that
obliging
stationer
who
would
take
in
letters
for
them
there
was
a
letter
for
next
day
whatever
his
other
defects
as
a
correspondent
watson
was
at
least
prompt
with
his
responses
montagu
watson
presented
his
compliments
and
was
deeply
grateful
for
all
the
kind
things
had
said
about
his
work
in
her
letter
of
the
inst
he
was
however
afraid
that
he
scarcely
deserved
them
her
opportunities
of
deriving
consolation
from
the
soul
of
anthony
carrington
had
been
limited
by
the
fact
that
that
book
had
only
been
published
ten
days
before
while
as
for
pancakes
to
which
she
had
referred
in
such
flattering
terms
he
feared
that
another
author
must
have
the
credit
of
any
refreshment
her
bereaved
spirit
might
have
extracted
from
that
volume
for
he
had
written
no
work
of
such
a
name
his
own
pan
wakes
would
he
hoped
administer
an
equal
quantity
of
balm
secretary
morrison
had
slept
badly
on
the
night
before
he
wrote
this
letter
and
had
expended
some
venom
upon
its
composition
sold
again
said
dunstable
you
better
chuck
it
now
it
no
good
said
linton
i
have
another
shot
then
i
try
and
think
of

two
days
later
morrison
replied
to
edgar
of
green
street
park
lane
to
the
effect
that
montagu
watson
was
deeply
grateful
for
all
the
kind
things
green
street
was
dunstable
home
address
at
this
juncture
the
correspondence
ceases
and
the
relations
become
more
personal
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
the
month
watson
taking
a
meditative
stroll
through
the
wood
which
formed
part
of
his
property
was
infuriated
by
the
sight
of
a
boy
he
was
not
a
man
who
was
fond
of
boys
even
in
their
proper
place
and
the
sight
of
one
in
the
middle
of
his
wood
prancing
lightly
about
among
the
nesting
pheasants
stirred
his
never
too
placid
mind
to
its
depths
he
shouted
the
apparition
paused
here
hi
you
boy
sir
said
the
stripling
with
a
winning
smile
lifting
his
cap
with
the
air
of
a
what
business
have
you
in
my
wood
not
business
corrected
the
visitor
pleasure
come
here
shrilled
the
novelist
the
stranger
receded
coyly
watson
advanced
at
the
double
his
quarry
dodged
behind
a
tree
for
five
minutes
the
great
man
devoted
his
powerful
mind
solely
to
the
task
of
catching
his
visitor
the
latter
however
proved
as
elusive
as
the
point
of
a
epigram
and
at
the
end
of
the
five
minutes
he
was
no
longer
within
sight
watson
went
off
and
addressed
his
keeper
in
terms
which
made
that
worthy
envious
for
a
week
it
eddication
he
said
subsequently
to
a
friend
at
the
cowslip
inn
you
and
me
could
talk
like
that
it
wants
eddication
for
the
next
few
days
the
keeper
existence
was
enlivened
by
visits
from
what
appeared
to
be
a
most
enthusiastic
by
no
other
theory
could
he
account
for
it
only
a
boy
with
a
collection
to
support
would
run
such
risks
to
the
keeper
mind
the
human
boy
up
to
the
age
of
twenty
or
so
had
no
object
in
life
except
to
collect
eggs
after
twenty
of
course
he
took
to
poaching
this
was
a
boy
of
about
seventeen
on
the
fifth
day
he
caught
him
and
conducted
him
into
the
presence
of
montagu
watson
watson
was
brief
and
to
the
point
he
recognised
his
visitor
as
the
boy
for
whose
benefit
he
had
made
himself
stiff
for
two
days
the
keeper
added
further
damaging
facts
bin
here
every
day
he
sir
for
the
last
week
well
i
says
to
myself
supposition
is
he
come
once
too
often
he
come
once
too
often
i
says
and
then
i
says
i
cotch
him
and
i
cotched
him
the
keeper
narrative
style
had
something
of
the
classic
simplicity
of
julius
caesar
watson
bit
his
pen
what
you
boys
come
for
i
ca
understand
he
said
irritably
you
from
the
school
of
course
yes
said
the
captive
well
i
shall
report
you
to
your
what
is
your
name
dunstable
your
house
day
very
good
that
is
all
dunstable
retired
his
next
appearance
in
public
life
was
in
day
study
day
had
sent
for
him
after
preparation
he
held
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
he
looked
annoyed
come
in
dunstable
i
have
just
received
a
letter
complaining
of
you
it
seems
that
you
have
been
trespassing
yes
sir
i
am
surprised
dunstable
that
a
sensible
boy
like
you
should
have
done
such
a
foolish
thing
it
seems
so
objectless
you
know
how
greatly
the
dislikes
any
sort
of
friction
between
the
school
and
the
neighbours
and
yet
you
deliberately
trespass
in
watson
wood
i
very
sorry
sir
i
have
had
a
most
indignant
letter
from
him
you
may
see
what
he
says
you
do
not
deny
it
dunstable
ran
his
eye
over
the
straggling
untidy
sentences
no
sir
it
quite
true
in
that
case
i
shall
have
to
punish
you
severely
you
will
write
me
out
the
greek
numerals
ten
times
and
show
them
up
to
me
on
tuesday
yes
sir
that
will
do
at
the
door
dunstable
paused
well
dunstable
said
day
er
i
glad
you
got
his
autograph
after
all
sir
he
said
then
he
closed
the
door
as
he
was
going
to
bed
that
night
dunstable
met
the
on
the
stairs
dunstable
said
day
yes
sir
on
second
thoughts
it
would
be
better
if
instead
of
the
greek
numerals
ten
times
you
wrote
me
the
first
ode
of
the
first
book
of
horace
the
numerals
would
be
a
little
long
perhaps
pillingshot
detective
life
at
austin
was
rendered
somewhat
hollow
and
burdensome
for
pillingshot
by
the
fact
that
he
fagged
for
scott
not
that
scott
was
the
bully
in
any
way
far
from
it
he
showed
a
kindly
interest
in
pillingshot
welfare
and
sometimes
even
did
his
latin
verses
for
him
but
the
noblest
natures
have
flaws
and
scott
was
no
exception
he
was
by
way
of
being
a
humorist
and
pillingshot
with
his
rather
serious
outlook
on
life
was
puzzled
and
inconvenienced
by
this
it
was
through
this
defect
in
scott
character
that
pillingshot
first
became
a
detective
he
was
toasting
muffins
at
the
study
fire
one
evening
while
scott
seated
on
two
chairs
and
five
cushions
read
sherlock
holmes
when
the
prefect
laid
down
his
book
and
fixed
him
with
an
earnest
eye
do
you
know
pillingshot
he
said
you
got
a
bright
intelligent
face
i
should
wonder
if
you
were
rather
clever
why
do
you
hide
your
light
under
a
bushel
pillingshot
grunted
we
must
find
some
way
of
advertising
you
why
do
you
go
in
for
a
junior
scholarship
too
old
said
pillingshot
with
satisfaction
senior
then
too
young
i
believe
by
sitting
up
all
night
and
swotting
here
i
say
said
pillingshot
alarmed
you
got
no
enterprise
said
scott
sadly
what
are
those
muffins
well
well
i
suppose
i
had
better
try
and
peck
a
bit
he
ate
four
in
rapid
succession
and
resumed
his
scrutiny
of
pillingshot
countenance
the
great
thing
he
said
is
to
find
out
your
special
line
till
then
we
are
working
in
the
dark
perhaps
it
music
singing
sing
me
a
bar
or
two
pillingshot
wriggled
uncomfortably
left
your
music
at
home
said
scott
never
mind
then
perhaps
all
for
the
best
what
are
those
still
muffins
hand
me
another
after
all
one
must
keep
one
strength
up
you
can
have
one
if
you
like
pillingshot
face
brightened
he
became
more
affable
he
chatted
there
rather
a
row
on
downstairs
he
said
in
the
junior
there
always
is
said
scott
if
it
grows
too
loud
i
shall
get
in
amongst
them
with
a
i
attribute
half
my
success
at
bringing
off
to
the
practice
i
have
had
in
the
junior
it
keeps
the
wrist
supple
i
do
mean
that
sort
of
row
it
about
evans
what
about
evans
he
lost
a
sovereign
silly
young
ass
pillingshot
furtively
helped
himself
to
another
muffin
he
thinks
some
one
taken
it
he
said
what
stolen
it
pillingshot
nodded
what
makes
him
think
that
he
does
see
how
else
it
could
have
gone
oh
i
do
by
jove
scott
sat
up
with
some
excitement
i
got
it
he
said
i
knew
we
should
hit
on
it
sooner
or
later
here
a
field
for
your
genius
you
shall
be
a
detective
pillingshot
i
hand
this
case
over
to
you
i
employ
you
pillingshot
gaped
i
feel
certain
that
your
line
i
often
noticed
you
walking
over
to
school
looking
exactly
like
a
get
to
work
as
a
start
you
better
fetch
evans
up
here
and
question
him
but
look
here
buck
up
man
buck
up
do
you
know
that
every
moment
is
precious
evans
a
small
stout
youth
was
not
disposed
to
be
reticent
the
gist
of
his
rambling
statement
was
as
follows
rich
uncle
impecunious
nephew
visit
of
former
to
latter
handsome
tip
one
sovereign
impecunious
nephew
pouches
sovereign
and
it
vanishes
and
i
call
it
beastly
rot
concluded
evans
volubly
and
if
i
could
find
the
cad
who
pinched
it
i
jolly
well
less
of
it
said
scott
now
then
pillingshot
i
begin
this
thing
just
to
start
you
off
what
makes
you
think
the
quid
has
been
stolen
evans
because
i
jolly
well
know
it
has
what
you
jolly
well
know
is
evidence
we
must
thresh
this
thing
out
to
begin
with
where
did
you
last
see
it
when
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
good
make
a
note
of
that
pillingshot
where
your
notebook
not
got
one
here
you
are
then
you
can
tear
out
the
first
few
pages
the
ones
i
written
on
ready
carry
on
evans
when

what
when
did
you

it
in
your
pocket

time

of
bags

on
it
where

gone
to
the
about
time

i
noticed
them

the
wash

i
turned
both
the
pockets
inside
out

hole
in
the
pocket

when
did
you
take
off
the
bags

you
sleep
in
them
i
wore
till
and
then
shoved
them
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
bed
it
was
till
next
morning
that
i
remembered
the
quid
was
in
them
but
it
was
objected
scott
i
thought
it
was
it
ought
to
have
been
he
thought
it
was
that
a
clue
young
pillingshot
work
on
it
well
well
when
i
went
to
take
the
quid
out
of
my
cricket
bags
it
there
what
time
was
that
seven
this
morning
what
time
did
you
go
to
bed
ten
then
the
theft
occurred
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
mind
you
i
giving
you
a
jolly
good
young
pillingshot
but
as
it
your
first
case
i
do
mind
that
be
all
from
you
evans
pop
off
evans
disappeared
scott
turned
to
the
detective
well
young
pillingshot
he
said
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
do
know
what
steps
do
you
propose
to
take
i
do
know
you
a
lot
of
use
are
you
as
a
start
you
better
examine
the
scene
of
the
robbery
i
should
say
pillingshot
reluctantly
left
the
room
well
said
scott
when
he
returned
any
clues
no
you
thoroughly
examined
the
scene
of
the
robbery
i
looked
under
the
bed
the
bed
what
the
good
of
that
did
you
go
over
every
inch
of
the
strip
of
carpet
leading
to
the
chair
with
a
had
got
a
then
you
better
buck
up
and
get
one
if
you
going
to
be
a
detective
do
you
think
sherlock
holmes
ever
moved
a
step
without
his
not
much
well
anyhow
did
you
find
any
or
there
was
a
jolly
lot
of
dust
about
did
you
preserve
a
sample
no
my
word
you
a
lot
to
learn
now
weighing
the
evidence
does
anything
strike
you
no
you
a
bright
sort
of
are
you
it
seems
to
me
doing
all
the
work
on
this
case
i
have
to
give
you
another
considering
the
time
when
the
quid
disappeared
i
should
say
that
somebody
in
the
dormitory
must
have
collared
it
how
many
fellows
are
there
in
evans
dormitory
i
do
know
cut
along
and
find
out
the
detective
reluctantly
trudged
off
once
more
well
said
scott
on
his
return
seven
said
pillingshot
counting
evans
we
need
count
evans
if
he
ass
enough
to
steal
his
own
quids

deserves
to
lose
them

the
other
six
there

green
berkeley
hanson
and
daubeny
every
one
of
them
well
known
to
the
police
why
the
place
is
a
perfect
thieves
kitchen
look
here
we
must
act
swiftly
young
pillingshot
this
is
a
black
business
we
take
them
in
alphabetical
order
run
and
fetch
berkeley
berkeley
interrupted
in
a
game
of
halma
came
unwillingly
now
then
pillingshot
put
your
questions
said
scott
this
is
a
black
business
berkeley
young
evans
has
lost
a
sovereign
if
you
think
i
taken
his
beastly

berkeley
warmly
make
a
note
that
on
being
questioned
the
man
berkeley
exhibited
suspicious
emotion
go
on
jam
it
down
pillingshot
reluctantly
entered
the
statement
under
indignant
gaze
now
then
carry
on
you
know
it
all
rot
protested
pillingshot
i
never
said
berkeley
had
anything
to
do
with
it
never
mind
ask
him
what
his
movements
were
on
the
night
of
the
what
was
yesterday
on
the
night
of
the
sixteenth
of
july
pillingshot
put
the
question
nervously
i
was
in
bed
of
course
you
silly
ass
were
you
asleep
inquired
scott
of
course
i
was
then
how
do
you
know
what
you
were
doing
pillingshot
make
a
note
of
the
fact
that
the
man
berkeley
statement
was
confused
and
contradictory
it
a
clue
work
on
it
who
next
daubeny
berkeley
send
daubeny
up
here
all
right
pillingshot
you
wait
was
berkeley
exit
speech
daubeny
when
examined
exhibited
the
same
suspicious
emotion
that
berkeley
had
shown
and
hanson
simms
and
green
behaved
in
a
precisely
similar
manner
this
said
scott
somewhat
complicates
the
case
we
must
have
further
clues
you
better
pop
off
now
pillingshot
i
got
a
latin
prose
to
do
bring
me
reports
of
your
progress
daily
and
overlook
the
importance
of
trifles
why
in
blaze
it
was
a
burnt
match
that
first
put
holmes
on
the
scent
entering
the
junior
with
some
apprehension
the
found
an
excited
gathering
of
suspects
waiting
to
interview
him
one
sentiment
animated
the
meeting
each
of
the
five
wanted
to
know
what
pillingshot
meant
by
it
what
the
row
queried
interested
spectators
rallying
round
that
cad
pillingshot
been
accusing
us
of
bagging
evans
quid
what
scott
got
to
do
with
it
inquired
one
of
the
spectators
pillingshot
explained
his
position
all
the
same
said
daubeny
you
need
have
dragged
us
into
it
i
could
help
it
he
made
me
awful
ass
scott
admitted
green
pillingshot
welcomed
this
sign
that
the
focus
of
popular
indignation
was
being
shifted
shoving
himself
into
other
people
business
grumbled
pillingshot
trying
to
be
funny
berkeley
summed
up
rotten
at
cricket
too
ca
play
a
yorker
for
nuts
see
him
drop
that
sitter
on
saturday
so
that
was
all
right
as
far
as
the
junior
was
concerned
pillingshot
felt
himself
vindicated
but
his
employer
was
less
easily
satisfied
pillingshot
had
hoped
that
by
the
next
day
he
would
have
forgotten
the
subject
but
when
he
went
into
the
study
to
get
tea
ready
up
it
came
again
any
clues
yet
pillingshot
pillingshot
had
to
admit
that
there
were
none
hullo
this
wo
do
you
must
bustle
about
you
must
get
your
nose
to
the
trail
have
you
trent
yet
no
well
there
you
are
then
nip
off
and
do
it
now
but
i
say
scott
he
a
prefect
in
the
dictionary
of
crime
said
scott
sententiously
there
is
no
such
word
as
prefect
all
are
alike
go
and
take
down
statement
to
tax
a
prefect
with
having
stolen
a
sovereign
was
a
task
at
which
pillingshot
imagination
boggled
he
went
to
trent
study
in
a
sort
of
dream
a
hoarse
roar
answered
his
feeble
tap
there
was
no
doubt
about
trent
being
in
inspection
revealed
the
fact
that
the
prefect
was
working
and
evidently
to
conversation
he
wore
a
haggard
look
and
his
eye
as
it
caught
that
of
the
collector
of
statements
was
dangerous
well
said
trent
scowling
murderously
pillingshot
legs
felt
perfectly
boneless
said
trent
pillingshot
yammered
the
roar
shook
the
window
and
pillingshot
presence
of
mind
deserted
him
altogether
have
you
bagged
a
sovereign
he
asked
there
was
an
awful
silence
during
which
the
detective
his
limbs
suddenly
becoming
active
again
banged
the
door
and
shot
off
down
the
passage
he
scott
study
at
the
double
well
said
scott
what
did
he
say
nothing
get
out
your
and
put
down
under
the
heading
silence
a
very
bad
lot
trent
keep
him
under
constant
espionage
it
a
clue
work
on
it
pillingshot
made
a
note
of
the
silence
but
later
on
when
he
and
the
prefect
met
in
the
dormitory
felt
inclined
to
erase
it
for
silence
was
the
last
epithet
one
would
have
applied
to
trent
on
that
occasion
as
he
crawled
painfully
into
bed
pillingshot
became
more
than
ever
convinced
that
the
path
of
the
amateur
detective
was
a
thorny
one
this
conviction
deepened
next
day
scott
help
was
possibly
well
meant
but
it
was
certainly
inconvenient
his
theories
were
of
the
brilliant
dashing
order
and
pillingshot
could
never
be
certain
who
and
in
what
rank
of
life
the
next
suspect
would
be
he
spent
that
afternoon
shadowing
the
greaser
the
combination
of
and
butler
who
did
the
odd
jobs
about
the
school
house
and
in
the
evening
seemed
likely
to
be
about
to
move
in
the
very
highest
circles
this
was
when
scott
remarked
in
a
dreamy
voice
you
know
i
told
the
old
man
has
been
spending
a
good
lot
of
money
lately
to
which
the
burden
of
pillingshot
reply
was
that
he
would
do
anything
in
reason
but
he
was
blowed
if
he
was
going
to
the
it
seems
to
me
said
scott
sadly
that
you
do
to
find
that
sovereign
do
you
like
evans
or
what
is
it
it
was
on
the
following
morning
after
breakfast
that
the
close
observer
might
have
noticed
a
change
in
the
detective
demeanour
he
no
longer
looked
as
if
he
were
weighed
down
by
a
secret
sorrow
his
manner
was
even
jaunty
scott
noticed
it
what
up
he
inquired
got
a
clue
pillingshot
nodded
what
is
it
let
have
a
look
sh
h
h
said
pillingshot
mysteriously
scott
interest
was
aroused
when
his
fag
was
making
tea
in
the
afternoon
he
questioned
him
again
out
with
it
he
said
what
the
point
of
all
this
silent
mystery
business
sherlock
holmes
never
gave
anything
away
out
with
it
walls
have
ears
said
pillingshot
so
have
you
replied
scott
crisply
and
i
smite
them
in
half
a
second
pillingshot
sighed
resignedly
and
produced
an
envelope
from
this
he
poured
some
dried
mud
here
steady
on
with
my
said
scott
what
this
mud
what
about
it
where
do
you
think
it
came
from
how
should
i
know
road
i
suppose
pillingshot
smiled
faintly
eighteen
different
kinds
of
mud
about
here
he
said
patronisingly
this
is
mud
from
the
house
well
what
about
it
sh
h
h
said
pillingshot
and
glided
out
of
the
room
well
asked
scott
next
day
clues
pouring
in
all
right
rather
what
got
another
pillingshot
walked
silently
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
he
looked
up
and
down
the
passage
then
he
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
the
table
where
he
took
from
his
a
used
match
scott
turned
it
over
inquiringly
what
the
idea
of
this
a
clue
said
pillingshot
see
anything
queer
about
it
see
that
rummy
brown
stain
on
it
yes
blood
snorted
pillingshot
what
the
good
of
blood
there
been
no
murder
pillingshot
looked
serious
i
never
thought
of
that
you
must
think
of
everything
the
worst
mistake
a
detective
can
make
is
to
get
switched
off
on
to
another
track
while
he
working
on
a
case
this
match
is
a
clue
to
something
else
you
ca
work
on
it
i
suppose
not
said
pillingshot
do
be
discouraged
you
doing
fine
i
know
said
pillingshot
i
shall
find
that
quid
all
right
nothing
like
sticking
to
it
pillingshot
shuffled
then
rose
to
a
point
of
order
i
been
reading
those
sherlock
holmes
stories
he
said
and
sherlock
holmes
always
got
a
fee
if
he
brought
a
thing
off
i
think
i
ought
to
too
mercenary
young
brute
it
has
been
a
beastly
sweat
done
you
good
supplied
you
with
a
serious
interest
in
life
well
i
expect
evans
will
give
you
something
a
jewelled
or
something
if
you
pull
the
thing
off
do
well
he
buy
you
a
tea
or
something
he
wo
he
not
going
to
break
the
quid
he
saving
up
for
a
camera
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
pillingshot
kicked
the
leg
of
the
table
put
me
on
to
the
case
he
said
casually
what
if
you
think
i
going
to
squander
i
think
you
ought
to
let
me
off
fagging
for
the
rest
of
the
term
scott
reflected
there
something
in
that
all
right
thanks
do
mention
it
you
have
found
the
quid
yet
i
know
where
it
is
where
ah
fool
said
scott
after
breakfast
next
day
scott
was
seated
in
his
study
when
pillingshot
entered
here
you
are
said
pillingshot
he
unclasped
his
right
hand
and
exhibited
a
sovereign
scott
inspected
it
is
this
the
one
he
said
yes
said
pillingshot
how
do
you
know
it
i
sifted
all
the
evidence
who
had
bagged
it
i
do
want
to
mention
names
oh
all
right
as
he
did
spend
any
of
it
it
does
much
matter
not
that
it
much
catch
having
a
thief
roaming
at
large
about
the
house
anyhow
what
put
you
on
to
him
how
did
you
get
on
the
track
you
a
jolly
smart
kid
young
pillingshot
how
did
you
work
it
i
have
my
methods
said
pillingshot
with
dignity
buck
up
i
shall
have
to
be
going
over
to
school
in
a
second
i
hardly
like
to
tell
you
tell
me
dash
it
all
i
put
you
on
to
the
case
i
your
employer
you
wo
touch
me
up
if
i
tell
you
i
will
if
you
do
but
not
if
i
do
no
and
how
about
the
fee
that
all
right
go
on
all
right
then
well
i
thought
the
whole
thing
over
and
i
make
anything
out
of
it
at
first
because
it
did
seem
likely
that
trent
or
any
of
the
other
fellows
in
the
dormitory
had
taken
it
and
then
suddenly
something
evans
told
me
the
day
before
yesterday
made
it
all
clear
what
was
that
he
said
that
the
matron
had
just
given
him
back
his
quid
which
one
of
the
housemaids
had
found
on
the
floor
by
his
bed
it
had
dropped
out
of
his
pocket
that
first
night
scott
eyed
him
fixedly
pillingshot
coyly
evaded
his
gaze
that
was
it
was
it
said
scott
pillingshot
nodded
it
was
a
clue
he
said
i
worked
on
it
