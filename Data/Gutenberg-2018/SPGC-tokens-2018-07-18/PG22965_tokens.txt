this
volume
is
affectionately
inscribed
by
the
author
preface
this
volume
deals
with
a
series
of
journeys
taken
with
a
dog
team
over
the
winter
trails
in
the
interior
of
alaska
the
title
might
have
claimed
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
miles
instead
of
ten
for
the
book
was
projected
and
the
title
adopted
some
years
ago
and
the
journeys
have
continued
but
ten
thousand
is
a
good
round
titular
number
and
is
none
the
worse
for
being
well
within
the
mark
so
far
as
mere
distance
is
concerned
anyway
there
is
nothing
noteworthy
in
this
record
there
are
many
men
in
alaska
who
have
done
much
more
a
on
one
of
the
longer
dog
routes
will
cover
four
thousand
miles
in
a
winter
while
the
writer
average
is
less
than
two
thousand
but
his
sled
has
gone
far
off
the
beaten
track
across
the
arctic
wilderness
into
many
remote
corners
wherever
indeed
white
men
or
natives
were
to
be
found
in
all
the
great
interior
these
journeys
were
connected
primarily
with
the
administration
of
the
extensive
work
of
the
episcopal
church
in
the
interior
of
alaska
under
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
but
that
feature
of
them
has
been
fully
set
forth
from
time
to
time
in
the
church
publications
and
finds
only
incidental
reference
here
it
is
a
great
wild
country
little
known
save
along
accustomed
routes
of
travel
a
country
with
a
beauty
and
a
fascination
all
its
own
mere
arctic
wilderness
indeed
and
nine
tenths
of
it
probably
destined
always
to
remain
such
yet
full
of
interest
and
charm
common
opinion
outside
about
alaska
seems
to
be
veering
from
the
view
that
it
is
a
land
of
perpetual
snow
and
ice
to
the
other
extreme
of
holding
it
to
be
a
world
of
mineral
wealth
and
agricultural
possibility
the
world
treasure
is
deposited
in
many
houses
and
alaska
has
its
share
its
mineral
wealth
is
very
great
and
hidden
doors
of
opulence
may
open
at
any
time
but
its
agricultural
possibilities
in
the
ordinary
sense
in
which
the
phrase
is
used
are
confined
to
very
small
areas
in
proportion
to
the
enormous
whole
and
in
very
limited
degree
it
is
no
new
thing
for
those
who
would
build
railways
to
write
in
style
about
the
regions
they
would
penetrate
and
indeed
to
speak
of
millions
of
acres
waiting
for
the
plough
is
not
necessarily
a
misrepresentation
they
are
waiting
nor
is
it
altogether
unnatural
that
professional
agricultural
experimenters
at
the
stations
established
by
the
government
should
make
the
most
of
their
experiments
when
dean
stanley
spoke
disdainfully
of
dogma
lord
beaconsfield
replied
ah
but
you
must
always
remember
no
dogmas
no
deans
besides
the
physical
attractions
of
this
country
it
has
a
gentle
aboriginal
population
that
arouses
in
many
ways
the
respect
and
the
sympathy
of
all
kindly
people
and
it
has
some
of
the
hardiest
and
most
adventurous
white
men
in
the
world
the
reader
will
come
into
contact
with
both
in
these
pages
so
much
for
the
book
scope
a
word
of
its
limitations
it
is
confined
to
the
interior
of
alaska
confined
in
the
main
to
the
great
valley
of
the
yukon
and
its
tributaries
being
a
record
of
sled
journeys
it
is
confined
to
the
winter
there
is
no
man
living
who
knows
the
whole
of
alaska
or
who
has
any
right
to
speak
about
the
whole
of
alaska
bishop
rowe
knows
more
about
alaska
in
all
probability
than
any
other
living
man
and
there
are
large
areas
of
the
country
in
which
he
has
never
set
foot
there
is
probably
no
man
living
save
bishop
rowe
who
has
visited
even
the
localities
of
all
the
missions
of
the
episcopal
church
in
alaska
if
one
were
to
travel
continuously
for
a
whole
year
using
the
most
expeditious
means
at
his
command
and
not
wasting
a
day
anywhere
it
is
doubtful
whether
summer
and
winter
by
sea
and
land
squeezing
the
last
mile
out
of
the
seasons
travelling
on
the
last
ice
and
the
first
water
he
could
even
touch
at
all
the
mission
stations
so
when
a
man
from
nome
speaks
of
alaska
he
means
his
part
of
alaska
the
seward
peninsula
when
a
man
from
valdez
or
cordova
speaks
of
alaska
he
means
the
prince
william
sound
country
when
a
man
from
juneau
speaks
of
alaska
he
means
the
southeastern
coast
alaska
is
not
one
country
but
many
with
different
climates
different
resources
different
problems
different
populations
different
interests
and
what
is
true
of
one
part
of
it
is
often
grotesquely
untrue
of
other
parts
this
is
the
reason
why
so
many
contradictory
things
have
been
written
about
the
country
not
only
do
these
various
parts
of
alaska
differ
radically
from
one
another
but
they
are
separated
from
one
another
by
almost
insuperable
natural
obstacles
so
that
they
are
in
reality
different
countries
when
alaska
is
spoken
of
in
this
book
the
interior
is
meant
in
which
the
writer
has
travelled
almost
continuously
for
the
past
eight
years
the
seward
peninsula
is
the
only
other
part
of
the
country
that
the
book
touches
and
as
regards
summer
travel
and
the
summer
aspect
of
the
country
there
is
material
for
another
book
should
the
reception
of
this
one
warrant
its
preparation
the
problems
of
the
civil
government
of
the
country
will
be
found
touched
upon
somewhat
freely
as
they
rise
from
time
to
time
in
the
course
of
these
journeys
and
some
faint
hope
is
entertained
that
drawing
attention
to
evils
may
hasten
a
remedy
alaska
is
not
now
and
never
has
been
a
lawless
country
in
the
old
wild
western
sense
of
unpunished
homicides
and
crimes
of
violence
it
has
been
on
the
whole
singularly
free
from
bloodshed
a
record
due
in
no
small
part
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
the
custom
of
the
country
to
carry
pistols
for
which
again
there
is
climatic
and
geographic
reason
due
also
in
part
to
the
very
peaceable
and
even
timid
character
of
its
native
people
but
as
regards
the
stringent
laws
enacted
by
congress
for
the
protection
of
these
native
people
and
especially
in
the
essential
particular
of
protecting
them
from
the
fatal
effects
of
intoxicating
liquor
the
country
is
not
for
these
laws
are
virtually
a
dead
letter
justices
of
the
peace
who
must
live
wholly
upon
fees
in
regions
where
fees
will
not
furnish
a
living
and
united
states
deputy
marshals
appointed
for
political
reasons
constitute
a
very
feeble
staff
against
when
it
is
remembered
that
on
the
whole
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
the
american
yukon
there
are
but
six
of
these
deputy
marshals
and
that
these
six
men
with
another
five
or
six
on
the
tributary
rivers
form
all
the
police
of
the
country
it
will
be
seen
that
congress
must
do
something
more
than
pass
stringent
laws
if
those
laws
are
to
be
of
any
effect
a
body
of
stipendiary
magistrates
a
police
force
wholly
removed
from
politics
and
modelled
somewhat
upon
the
canadian
northwest
mounted
police
these
are
two
of
the
great
needs
of
the
country
if
the
liquor
laws
are
to
be
enforced
and
the
native
people
are
to
survive
that
the
danger
of
the
extermination
of
the
natives
is
a
real
one
all
vital
statistics
kept
at
yukon
river
points
in
the
last
five
years
show
and
that
there
are
powerful
influences
in
the
country
opposed
to
the
execution
of
the
liquor
laws
some
recent
trials
at
fairbanks
would
leave
no
room
for
doubt
if
there
had
been
any
room
before
indeed
at
this
writing
when
the
pages
of
this
book
are
closed
and
there
remains
no
place
save
the
preface
where
the
matter
can
be
referred
to
an
impudent
attempt
is
on
foot
with
large
commercial
backing
to
secure
the
removal
of
a
zealous
and
fearless
united
states
district
attorney
who
has
been
too
active
in
prosecuting
to
suit
the
wholesale
dealers
in
liquor
there
are
of
course
those
who
view
with
perfect
equanimity
the
destruction
of
the
natives
that
is
now
going
on
and
look
forward
with
complacency
to
the
time
when
the
alaskan
indian
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
but
to
men
of
thought
and
feeling
such
cynicism
is
abhorrent
and
the
duty
of
the
government
towards
its
simple
and
kindly
wards
is
clear
a
measure
of
real
protection
must
be
given
the
native
communities
against
the
whites
who
seek
to
intrude
into
them
and
build
habitations
for
convenient
resort
upon
occasions
of
drunkenness
and
debauchery
and
some
adequate
machinery
set
up
for
suppressing
the
contemptible
traffic
in
adulterated
spirits
they
subsist
largely
upon
the
licensed
do
not
themselves
sell
to
indians
but
they
notoriously
sell
to
men
who
notoriously
peddle
to
indians
and
the
suppression
of
this
illicit
commerce
would
materially
reduce
the
total
sales
of
liquor
some
measure
of
protection
one
thinks
must
also
be
afforded
against
a
predatory
class
of
indian
traders
the
back
rooms
of
whose
stores
are
often
barrooms
and
houses
of
assignation
and
headquarters
and
harbourage
for
the
white
degenerates
even
if
the
government
go
the
length
of
setting
up
indian
stores
in
the
interior
as
has
been
done
in
some
places
on
the
coast
this
last
is
a
matter
in
which
the
missions
are
helpless
for
there
is
no
wise
combination
of
religion
and
trade
so
this
book
goes
forth
with
a
plea
in
the
front
of
it
which
will
find
incidental
support
and
expression
throughout
it
for
the
natives
of
interior
alaska
that
they
be
not
wantonly
destroyed
off
the
face
of
the
earth

preface
to
second
edition
it
is
gratifying
to
know
that
a
second
edition
of
this
book
has
been
called
for
and
it
is
interesting
to
write
another
preface
it
even
proved
interesting
to
do
what
was
set
about
most
reluctantly
the
reading
of
the
book
over
again
after
entire
avoidance
of
it
for
two
years
it
was
necessary
to
do
it
though
one
shrank
from
it
and
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
after
this
comparatively
long
and
complete
detachment
i
find
little
to
add
and
less
to
correct
upon
a
complete
rereading
i
am
content
to
let
the
book
stand
with
two
or
three
footnotes
thrown
in
and
the
correction
of
the
one
printer
error
it
contained
from
cover
to
cover
an
error
that
a
score
of
kind
correspondents
pointed
out
for
it
was
conspicuous
in
the
title
of
a
picture
the
tendency
to
which
attention
is
drawn
in
the
original
preface
the
pendulum
swing
from
the
old
notion
that
alaska
is
a
land
of
polar
bears
and
icebergs
to
the
new
notion
that
it
is
a
world
of
mineral
wealth
and
unbounded
agricultural
possibilities
is
yet
more
marked
than
it
was
two
years
ago
the
beginning
of
the
building
of
the
government
railway
has
given
new
impetus
to
the
boosting
writers
for
magazines
and
newspapers
quite
recently
it
was
stated
in
one
such
publication
that
we
need
not
worry
about
the
destruction
of
our
forests
for
had
we
not
the
inexhaustible
timber
resources
of
the
interior
of
alaska
to
draw
upon
and
in
the
north
itself
though
no
one
there
would
write
about
the
timber
resources
of
the
interior
in
certain
shrill
journals
the
man
who
does
not
confidently
expect
to
see
the
yukon
flats
waving
with
golden
grain
and
the
lowing
herd
wind
slowly
the
lea
of
the
koyukuk
and
the
chandalar
is
regarded
as
a
traitor
to
his
country
and
his
god
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
are
a
number
of
journalists
in
alaska
who
know
nothing
of
the
country
outside
their
respective
towns
and
that
boosting
grows
shriller
as
eugene
field
found
red
paint
grow
redder
the
further
out
west
one
goes
when
they
get
a
newspaper
at
cape
prince
of
wales
what
a
clarion
it
will
be
truth
however
is
not
more
wont
than
of
old
to
be
found
in
extremes
and
the
author
of
this
book
believes
that
those
who
desire
a
sober
view
of
the
country
it
deals
with
will
find
it
herein
he
claims
no
more
than
that
he
has
had
adequate
opportunity
of
forming
his
opinions
and
that
he
has
a
right
to
their
expression
it
is
now
twelve
years
since
he
began
almost
constant
travelling
winter
and
summer
in
the
interior
of
alaska
he
has
described
nothing
that
he
has
not
seen
ventured
no
judgment
that
he
has
not
well
digested
and
has
nothing
to
retract
or
even
modify
but
he
would
repeat
and
emphasise
a
caution
of
the
original
preface
alaska
is
not
one
country
but
many
countries
and
so
widely
do
they
differ
from
one
another
in
almost
every
respect
that
no
general
statements
about
alaska
can
be
true
the
present
author
knowledge
of
the
territory
is
confined
in
the
main
to
the
interior
to
the
valley
of
the
yukon
and
its
tributary
rivers
which
make
up
one
of
the
great
waterways
and
nothing
of
his
writing
applies
with
his
authority
to
other
parts
the
matter
of
the
preservation
of
the
native
peoples
still
presses
and
is
nearer
to
the
author
heart
than
any
other
matter
whatever
the
united
states
congress
which
voted
millions
of
dollars
for
the
government
railroad
strikes
out
year
by
year
the
modest
additional
score
or
two
of
thousands
that
year
by
year
the
bureau
of
education
asks
for
the
establishment
of
hospital
work
amongst
the
indians
of
the
interior
and
the
preventable
mortality
continues
to
be
very
great
in
the
last
two
years
largely
as
the
result
of
the
untiring
efforts
of
bishop
rowe
on
behalf
of
the
natives
two
modern
hospitals
have
been
built
with
money
that
he
and
his
clergy
have
gathered
on
the
yukon
river
one
at
fort
yukon
and
one
at
tanana
and
these
are
the
only
places
of
any
kind
on
nearly
a
thousand
miles
of
the
river
where
sick
or
injured
indians
may
be
received
and
cared
for
amongst
men
of
thought
and
feeling
there
is
noticeable
revulsion
from
the
supercilious
attitude
that
used
not
to
be
uncommon
toward
the
little
peoples
of
the
world
it
begins
to
be
recognised
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
even
the
smallest
of
the
little
peoples
may
have
some
contribution
to
make
to
the
welfare
and
progress
of
the
human
race
what
is
the
boy
scout
movement
that
is
sweeping
the
country
to
the
enormous
benefit
of
the
rising
generation
but
the
incorporating
into
the
nurture
of
our
youth
of
the
things
that
were
the
nurture
of
the
indian
youth
that
are
a
large
part
of
the
nurture
of
the
alaskan
indian
youth
and
the
clubs
and
woodcraft
associations
and
the
whole
trend
to
the
life
of
the
open
recognise
that
the
indian
had
developed
a
technique
of
wilderness
life
deserving
of
preservation
for
its
value
to
the
white
man
while
as
for
the
esquimaux
the
author
never
sees
the
extraordinary
prevalence
amongst
them
of
the
art
of
graphic
delineation
displayed
in
bold
etchings
of
incidents
of
the
chase
upon
their
implements
and
weapons
though
not
upon
the
articles
made
by
the
dozen
for
the
at
nome
and
saint
michael
without
dreaming
that
some
day
an
artist
will
come
from
out
that
singular
and
most
interesting
people
who
shall
teach
the
world
something
new
about
art
whatever
the
future
may
hold
for
the
interior
of
alaska
the
author
is
convinced
that
its
population
will
derive
very
largely
from
the
present
native
stocks
and
this
alone
would
justify
any
efforts
to
prevent
further
inroads
upon
their
health
and
vitality

note
three
fundamental
facts
are
to
be
borne
constantly
in
mind
by
those
who
would
form
any
intelligent
conception
of
the
territory
of
alaska
its
area
of
approximately
square
miles
makes
it
two
and
a
half
times
as
large
as
the
state
of
texas
but
it
is
not
like
texas
one
homogeneous
body
of
land
it
is
not
in
any
geographical
sense
one
country
at
all
sweeping
in
a
great
arc
over
sixteen
degrees
of
latitude
and
degrees
of
longitude
it
is
no
less
than
four
and
some
might
say
five
different
countries
differing
from
one
another
in
almost
every
way
that
one
country
can
differ
from
another
in
climate
in
population
in
resources
in
requirements
and
these
different
countries
are
not
merely
different
from
one
another
they
are
from
one
another

formidable
natural

the
plan
for
the
winter
journey
of
my
second
winter
on
the
trail
was
an
ambitious
one
for
it
contemplated
a
visit
to
point
hope
on
the
shore
of
the
arctic
ocean
between
kotzebue
sound
and
point
barrow
and
a
return
to
fairbanks
in
the
summer
such
a
journey
would
be
practicable
only
by
water
down
the
tanana
to
the
yukon
down
the
yukon
to
its
mouth
and
then
through
the
straits
of
bering
and
along
the
arctic
coast
in
the
winter
it
is
possible
to
make
the
journey
across
country
a
desire
to
visit
our
most
northerly
and
most
inaccessible
mission
in
alaska
and
a
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
general
conditions
in
the
wide
country
north
of
the
yukon
were
equal
factors
in
the
planning
of
a
journey
which
would
carry
me
through
three
and
a
half
degrees
of
latitude
and
no
less
than
eighteen
degrees
of
longitude
the
course
of
winter
travel
in
alaska
follows
the
frozen
waterways
so
far
as
they
lead
in
the
general
direction
desired
leaves
them
to
cross
mountain
ranges
and
divides
at
the
most
favourable
points
and
drops
down
into
the
streams
again
so
soon
as
streams
are
available
the
country
is
notably
well
watered
and
the
waterways
are
the
natural
highways
the
more
frequented
routes
gradually
cut
out
the
serpentine
bends
of
the
rivers
by
land
trails
but
in
the
wilder
parts
of
the
country
travel
sticks
to
the
ice
our
course
therefore
lay
up
the
chatanika
river
and
one
of
its
tributaries
until
the
watershed
was
reached
then
through
the
mountains
crossing
two
steep
summits
to
the
yukon
slope
and
down
that
slope
by
convenient
streams
to
the
yukon
river
at
circle
city
sidenote
the
gold
train
we
set
out
on
the
of
november
with
six
dogs
and
a
basket
sled
and
about
five
hundred
pounds
weight
of
load
including
tent
and
stove
bedding
clothes
for
the
winter
grub
box
and
its
equipment
and
dog
feed
the
dogs
were
those
that
i
had
used
the
previous
winter
with
one
exception
the
leader
had
come
home
lame
from
the
fish
camp
where
he
had
been
boarded
during
the
summer
and
despite
all
attentions
the
lameness
had
persisted
so
he
must
be
left
behind
and
there
was
much
difficulty
in
securing
another
leader
a
recent
stampede
to
a
new
mining
district
had
advanced
the
price
of
dogs
and
gathered
up
all
the
good
ones
so
it
was
necessary
to
hunt
all
over
fairbanks
and
pay
a
hundred
dollars
for
a
dog
that
proved
very
indifferent
after
all
jimmy
was
a
handsome
beast
the
handsomest
i
ever
owned
and
the
costliest
but
as
i
learned
later
from
one
who
knew
his
history
had
travelled
on
his
looks
all
his
life
he
earned
the
name
of
jimmy
the
fake
midway
to
cleary
city
on
the
chief
creek
of
the
district
our
first
day
run
we
encountered
the
gold
train
for
some
time
previous
a
lone
highwayman
had
robbed
solitary
miners
on
their
way
to
fairbanks
with
and
now
a
posse
was
organised
that
went
the
rounds
of
the
creeks
and
gathered
up
the
dust
and
bore
it
on
to
the
bank
escorted
by
half
a
dozen
armed
and
mounted
men
shotguns
were
the
favourite
weapons
and
one
judged
them
deadly
enough
at
short
range
the
heavy
pokes
galled
the
animals
backs
however
they
might
be
slung
and
the
little
procession
wound
slowly
along
a
man
ahead
a
man
behind
and
four
clustered
round
the
treasure
these
raw
temporary
mining
towns
are
much
alike
the
world
over
one
supposes
though
perhaps
a
little
worse
up
here
in
the
far
north
it
was
late
at
night
when
we
reached
the
place
but
saloon
and
were
ablaze
with
light
and
loud
with
the
raucity
of
phonographs
and
the
stamping
of
feet
everything
was
wide
open
and
there
was
not
even
the
thinnest
veneer
of
respectability
drinking
and
gambling
and
dancing
go
on
all
night
long
drunken
men
reel
out
upon
the
snow
painted
faces
leer
over
muslin
curtains
as
one
passes
by
without
any
government
without
any
pretence
of
municipal
organisation
there
is
no
for
public
enterprise
there
are
no
streets
there
are
no
sidewalks
save
such
as
a
man
may
choose
to
lay
in
front
of
his
own
premises
and
the
simplest
sanitary
precautions
are
entirely
neglected
nothing
but
the
cold
climate
of
the
north
prevents
epidemic
disease
from
sweeping
through
these
places
they
rise
in
a
few
days
wherever
gold
is
found
in
quantities
they
flourish
as
the
production
increases
decline
with
its
decline
and
are
left
gaunt
dark
and
abandoned
so
soon
as
the
diggings
are
exhausted
the
next
day
we
were
on
the
chatanika
river
to
which
cleary
creek
is
tributary
and
were
immediately
confronted
with
one
of
the
main
troubles
and
difficulties
of
winter
travel
in
this
and
as
may
be
supposed
in
any
arctic
or
subarctic
country
overflow
water
sidenote
overflow
water
and
ice
in
the
lesser
rivers
where
deep
pools
alternate
with
swift
shallows
the
stream
freezes
solid
to
the
bottom
upon
the
shoals
and
riffles
since
the
subterranean
fountains
that
supply
the
river
do
not
cease
to
discharge
their
waters
in
the
winter
however
cold
it
may
be
there
comes
presently
an
increasing
pressure
under
the
ice
above
such
a
barrier
the
water
is
strong
enough
to
heave
the
ice
into
mounds
and
at
last
to
break
forth
spreading
itself
far
along
the
frozen
surface
of
the
river
at
times
it
may
be
seen
gushing
out
like
an
artesian
well
rising
three
or
four
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
ice
until
the
pressure
is
relieved
sometimes
for
many
miles
at
a
stretch
the
whole
river
will
be
covered
with
a
succession
of
such
overflows
from
two
or
three
inches
deep
to
eight
or
ten
or
even
twelve
some
just
bursting
forth
some
partially
frozen
some
resolved
into
solid
glare
ice
thus
the
surface
of
the
river
is
continually
renewed
the
whole
winter
through
and
a
section
of
the
ice
crust
in
the
spring
would
show
a
series
of
laminations
here
ice
upon
ice
there
ice
upon
snow
that
mark
the
successive
inundations
this
explanation
has
been
given
at
length
because
of
the
large
part
that
the
phenomenon
plays
in
the
difficulty
and
danger
of
winter
travel
and
because
it
seems
hard
to
make
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
it
understand
it
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
that
after
a
week
or
ten
days
of
weather
for
instance
all
water
everywhere
would
be
frozen
into
quiescence
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
throw
a
bucket
of
water
into
the
air
and
it
is
frozen
solid
as
soon
as
it
reaches
the
ground
there
would
be
no
more
trouble
one
would
think
with
water
yet
some
of
the
worst
trouble
the
traveller
has
with
overflow
water
is
during
very
cold
weather
and
it
is
then
of
course
that
there
is
the
greatest
danger
of
in
getting
one
feet
wet
footwear
therefore
becomes
one
of
the
musher
great
concerns
and
difficulties
the
best
footwear
is
the
esquimau
mukluk
not
easily
obtainable
in
the
interior
of
alaska
but
the
mukluk
is
an
inconvenient
footwear
to
put
on
rubber
boots
or
shoes
of
any
kind
are
most
uncomfortable
things
to
travel
in
nothing
equals
the
moccasin
on
the
trail
nothing
is
so
good
to
in
the
traveller
has
moccasins
for
dry
trails
and
mukluks
for
wet
trails
and
even
then
may
sometimes
get
his
feet
wet
nor
are
his
own
feet
his
only
consideration
his
dogs
feet
are
collectively
as
important
as
his
own
when
the
dog
comes
out
of
water
into
snow
again
the
snow
collects
and
freezes
between
the
toes
and
if
not
removed
will
soon
cause
a
sore
and
lameness
then
a
dog
moccasin
must
be
put
on
and
the
foot
continually
nursed
and
doctored
when
several
dogs
of
a
team
are
thus
affected
it
may
be
with
several
feet
each
the
labour
and
trouble
of
travel
are
greatly
increased
so
whenever
his
dogs
have
been
through
water
the
careful
musher
will
stop
and
go
all
down
the
line
cleaning
out
the
ice
and
snow
from
their
feet
with
his
fingers
four
interdigital
spaces
per
foot
make
sixteen
per
dog
and
with
a
team
of
six
dogs
that
means
several
operations
with
the
bare
hand
if
it
be
done
effectually
every
time
the
team
gets
into
an
overflow
the
dogs
will
do
it
for
themselves
if
they
are
given
time
tearing
out
the
lumps
of
ice
with
their
teeth
but
inasmuch
as
they
usually
feel
conscientiously
obliged
to
eat
each
lump
as
they
pull
it
out
it
takes
much
longer
and
in
a
short
daylight
there
is
little
time
to
spare
if
the
day
march
is
to
be
made
sidenote
overflow
ice
we
found
overflow
almost
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
chatanika
river
and
in
one
form
or
another
we
encountered
it
during
all
the
two
days
and
a
half
that
we
were
pursuing
the
river
windings
at
times
it
was
covered
with
a
sheet
of
new
ice
that
would
support
the
dogs
but
would
not
support
the
sled
so
that
the
dogs
were
travelling
on
one
level
and
the
sled
on
another
and
a
man
had
to
walk
along
in
the
water
between
the
dogs
and
the
sled
for
several
hundred
yards
at
a
time
breaking
down
the
overflow
ice
with
his
feet
at
other
times
the
thin
sheets
of
overflow
ice
would
sway
and
bend
as
the
sled
passed
quickly
over
them
in
a
way
that
gives
to
ice
in
such
condition
its
alaskan
name
of
while
for
the
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
of
mcmanus
creek
the
headwaters
of
the
chatanika
we
had
continuous
stretches
of
fine
glare
ice
with
enough
frost
crystals
upon
it
from
condensing
moisture
to
give
a
tooth
to
the
dogs
feet
just
as
varnish
on
a
photographic
negative
gives
tooth
to
the
retouching
pencil
perfectly
smooth
ice
is
a
very
difficult
surface
for
dogs
to
pass
over
glare
ice
slightly
roughened
by
frost
deposit
makes
splendid
fast
going
miles
or
so
from
fairbanks
and
just
about
to
circle
the
watercourse
is
left
and
the
first
summit
is
the
as
it
is
called
we
tried
hard
to
take
our
load
up
at
one
trip
but
found
it
impossible
to
do
so
and
had
to
unlash
the
sled
and
take
half
the
load
at
a
time
caching
it
on
the
top
while
we
returned
for
the
other
half
it
took
us
half
a
day
to
get
our
load
to
the
top
of
the
summit
a
rise
of
about
one
thousand
three
hundred
feet
from
the
creek
bed
as
the
aneroid
gave
it
in
the
steeper
pitches
we
had
to
take
the
axe
and
cut
steps
so
hard
and
smooth
does
the
incessant
wind
at
these
heights
beat
the
snow
and
on
our
second
trip
to
the
top
we
were
just
in
time
to
rescue
a
roll
of
bedding
that
had
been
blown
from
the
cache
and
was
about
to
descend
a
gully
from
which
we
could
hardly
have
recovered
it
this
summit
descended
we
were
in
birch
creek
water
and
had
we
followed
the
watercourse
would
have
reached
the
yukon
but
we
would
have
travelled
hundreds
of
miles
and
would
have
come
out
below
fort
yukon
while
we
were
bound
for
circle
city
so
there
was
another
and
a
yet
more
difficult
summit
to
cross
before
we
could
descend
the
yukon
slope
we
were
able
to
hire
a
man
and
two
dogs
to
help
us
over
the
eagle
summit
so
that
the
necessity
of
relaying
was
avoided
one
man
ahead
continually
calling
to
the
dogs
eight
dogs
steadily
pulling
and
two
men
behind
steadily
pushing
foot
by
foot
with
many
stoppages
as
one
bench
after
another
was
surmounted
we
got
the
load
to
the
top
at
last
a
rise
of
one
thousand
four
hundred
feet
in
less
than
three
miles
a
driving
cut
off
all
view
and
would
have
left
us
at
a
loss
which
way
to
proceed
but
for
the
stakes
that
indicated
it
the
descent
was
as
anxious
and
hazardous
as
the
ascent
had
been
laborious
the
dogs
were
loosed
and
sent
racing
down
the
slope
with
a
rope
around
the
sled
runners
one
man
took
the
gee
pole
and
another
the
and
each
himself
through
the
loose
deep
snow
to
check
the
momentum
of
the
sled
until
sled
and
men
turned
aside
and
came
to
a
stop
in
a
drift
to
avoid
a
steep
smooth
pitch
the
sled
extricated
it
was
poised
on
the
edge
of
the
pitch
and
turned
loose
on
the
hardened
snow
hurtling
down
three
or
four
hundred
feet
until
it
buried
itself
in
another
drift
the
dogs
were
necessary
to
drag
it
from
this
drift
and
one
had
to
go
down
and
bring
them
up
then
again
they
were
loosed
and
from
bench
to
bench
the
process
was
repeated
until
the
slope
grew
gentle
enough
to
permit
the
regulation
of
the
downward
progress
by
the
sidenote
summits
the
eagle
summit
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
summits
in
alaska
the
wind
blows
so
fiercely
that
sometimes
for
days
together
its
passage
is
almost
impossible
no
amount
of
trail
making
could
be
of
much
help
for
the
snow
smothers
up
everything
on
the
lee
of
the
hill
and
the
end
of
every
storm
presents
a
new
surface
and
an
altered
route
a
summit
in
this
alaskan
sense
is
of
course
a
saddle
between
peaks
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
easier
pass
and
no
way
around
the
only
way
to
avoid
the
eagle
summit
without
going
out
of
the
district
altogether
would
be
to
tunnel
it
the
summit
passed
we
found
better
trails
and
a
more
frequented
country
for
in
this
district
are
a
number
of
creeks
that
draw
supplies
from
circle
city
and
that
had
been
worked
ten
years
or
more
at
the
time
of
the
klondike
stampede
of
circle
city
was
already
established
as
a
flourishing
mining
camp
and
boasted
itself
the
largest
town
in
the
world
before
the
klondike
drew
away
its
people
as
a
stronger
magnet
draws
iron
filings
from
a
lesser
one
circle
had
a
population
of
about
three
thousand
take
a
town
of
three
thousand
and
reduce
it
to
thirty
or
forty
and
it
is
hard
to
resist
the
melancholy
impression
which
entrance
upon
it
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
brings
there
lay
the
great
white
yukon
in
the
middle
distance
beyond
it
the
yukon
flats
desolate
stretched
away
enormously
hedged
here
at
their
beginning
by
grey
dim
hills
spread
out
in
the
foreground
were
the
little
squat
huddling
cabins
that
belonged
to
no
one
with
never
a
light
in
a
window
or
smoke
from
a
chimney
the
untrodden
snow
drifted
against
door
and
porch
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
drearier
prospect
and
one
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
a
city
of
the
dead
rather
than
merely
a
dead
city
the
weather
had
grown
steadily
colder
since
we
reached
the
yukon
slope
and
for
two
days
before
reaching
circle
the
thermometer
had
stood
between
and
below
zero
it
was
all
right
for
us
to
push
on
the
trail
was
good
and
nearly
all
and
there
were
every
ten
or
twelve
miles
freighters
came
to
the
doors
as
we
passed
by
with
our
jangle
of
bells
and
would
raise
a
somewhat
chechaco
pride
in
our
breasts
by
remarking
you
do
seem
to
care
what
weather
you
travel
in
the
evil
of
it
was
that
the
perfectly
safe
travelling
between
eagle
creek
and
circle
emboldened
us
to
push
on
from
circle
under
totally
different
conditions
when
travelling
at
such
low
temperatures
became
highly
dangerous
and
brought
us
into
grave
misadventure
that
might
easily
have
been
fatal
catastrophe
our
original
start
was
a
week
later
than
had
been
planned
and
we
had
made
no
time
but
rather
lost
it
on
this
first
division
of
the
journey
if
we
were
to
reach
bettles
on
the
koyukuk
river
for
christmas
there
was
no
more
time
to
lose
and
i
was
anxious
to
spend
the
next
sunday
at
fort
yukon
three
days
journey
away
so
we
started
for
fort
yukon
on
thursday
the
of
december
the
day
after
we
reached
circle
sidenote
the
yukon
flats
a
certain
arctic
traveller
has
said
that
adventures
always
imply
either
incompetence
or
ignorance
of
local
conditions
and
there
is
some
truth
in
the
saying
our
misadventure
was
the
result
of
a
series
of
mistakes
no
one
of
which
would
have
been
other
than
discreditable
to
men
of
more
experience
our
course
lay
for
miles
through
the
yukon
flats
which
begin
at
circle
and
extend
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
the
river
course
below
that
point
the
flats
constitute
the
most
difficult
and
dangerous
part
of
the
whole
length
of
the
yukon
river
summer
or
winter
and
the
section
between
circle
city
and
fort
yukon
is
the
most
difficult
and
dangerous
part
of
the
flats
save
for
a
portage
or
land
trail
of
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
out
of
circle
the
trail
is
on
the
river
itself
which
is
split
up
into
many
channels
without
salient
landmarks
the
current
is
so
swift
that
many
stretches
run
open
water
far
into
the
winter
and
are
numerous
there
is
little
travel
on
the
flats
in
winter
and
a
accompanied
by
wind
may
obliterate
what
trail
there
is
in
an
hour
the
vehicle
used
in
the
flats
is
not
a
sled
but
a
toboggan
and
our
first
mistake
was
in
not
conforming
to
local
usage
in
this
respect
there
is
always
a
very
good
reason
for
local
usage
about
snow
vehicles
but
a
toboggan
which
had
been
ordered
from
a
native
at
fort
yukon
would
be
waiting
for
us
and
it
seemed
not
worth
while
to
go
to
the
expense
of
buying
another
merely
for
three
days
journey
the
second
mistake
was
in
engaging
a
boy
as
guide
instead
of
a
man
he
was
an
attractive
youth
of
about
fourteen
who
had
done
good
service
at
the
circle
city
mission
the
previous
winter
when
our
was
contending
against
an
epidemic
of
diphtheria
he
was
a
pleasant
boy
with
some
english
who
wanted
to
go
and
professed
knowledge
of
the
route
the
greatest
mistake
of
all
was
starting
out
through
that
lonely
waste
with
the
thermometer
at
below
zero
the
in
alaska
have
a
saying
that
travelling
at
below
is
all
right
as
long
as
it
all
right
if
there
be
a
good
trail
if
there
be
convenient
if
nothing
go
wrong
one
may
travel
without
special
risk
and
with
no
extraordinary
discomfort
at
below
zero
and
a
good
deal
lower
i
have
since
that
time
made
a
short
day
run
at
below
and
once
travelled
for
two
or
three
hours
on
a
stretch
at
below
but
there
is
always
more
or
less
chance
in
travelling
at
low
temperatures
because
a
very
small
thing
may
necessitate
a
stop
and
a
stop
may
turn
into
a
serious
thing
at
such
temperatures
one
must
keep
going
no
amount
of
clothing
that
it
is
possible
to
wear
on
the
trail
will
keep
one
warm
while
standing
still
for
dogs
and
men
alike
constant
brisk
motion
is
necessary
for
dogs
as
well
as
men
even
though
dogs
will
sleep
outdoors
in
such
cold
without
harm
for
they
can
not
take
as
good
care
of
themselves
in
the
harness
as
they
can
when
loose
a
trace
that
needs
mending
a
broken
buckle
a
string
that
must
be
replaced
may
chill
one
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
recover
warmth
again
the
bare
hand
can
not
be
exposed
for
many
seconds
without
beginning
to
freeze
it
is
dangerous
to
breathe
the
air
into
the
lungs
for
any
length
of
time
without
a
muffler
over
the
mouth
our
troubles
began
as
soon
as
we
started
the
trail
was
a
narrow
winding
toboggan
track
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
inches
while
our
sled
was
twenty
inches
wide
so
that
one
runner
was
always
dragging
in
the
loose
snow
and
that
meant
slow
heavy
going
sidenote
sunrise
and
sunset
the
days
were
nearing
the
shortest
of
the
year
when
in
these
latitudes
the
sun
does
but
show
himself
and
withdraw
again
but
especially
in
very
cold
weather
which
is
nearly
always
very
clear
weather
that
brief
appearance
is
preceded
by
a
feast
of
rich
delicate
colour
first
a
greenish
glow
on
the
southern
horizon
brightening
into
lemon
and
then
into
clear
primrose
invades
the
deep
purple
of
the
starry
heavens
then
a
beautiful
circle
of
blush
pink
above
a
circle
of
pure
amethyst
gradually
stretches
all
around
the
edge
of
the
sky
slowly
brightening
while
the
stars
fade
out
and
the
heavens
change
to
blue
the
dead
white
mirror
of
the
snow
takes
every
tint
that
the
skies
display
with
a
faint
but
exquisite
radiance
then
the
sun
disk
appears
with
a
flood
of
yellow
light
but
with
no
appreciable
warmth
and
for
a
little
space
his
level
rays
shoot
out
and
gild
the
tree
tops
and
the
distant
hills
the
snow
springs
to
life
dead
white
no
longer
its
dry
crystalline
particles
glitter
in
myriads
of
diamond
facets
with
every
colour
of
the
prism
then
the
sun
is
gone
and
the
lovely
circle
of
rose
pink
over
amethyst
again
stretches
round
the
horizon
slowly
fading
until
once
more
the
pale
primrose
glows
in
the
south
against
the
purple
sky
with
its
silver
stars
thus
sunrise
and
sunset
form
a
continuous
spectacle
with
a
purity
of
delicate
yet
splendid
colour
that
only
perfectly
dry
atmosphere
permits
the
primrose
glow
the
heralding
circle
the
ball
of
orange
light
the
valedictory
circle
the
primrose
glow
again
and
a
day
has
come
and
gone
air
can
hold
no
moisture
at
all
at
these
low
temperatures
and
the
skies
are
cloudless
sidenote
an
escapade
on
the
yukon
moreover
in
the
wilds
at
below
zero
there
is
the
most
complete
silence
all
animal
life
is
hidden
away
not
a
rabbit
flits
across
the
trail
in
the
absolutely
still
air
not
a
twig
moves
a
rare
raven
passes
overhead
and
his
cry
changed
from
a
hoarse
croak
to
a
sweet
liquid
note
reverberates
like
the
musical
glasses
there
is
no
more
delightful
sound
in
the
wilderness
than
this
occasional
lapse
into
music
of
the
raven
we
wound
through
the
scrub
spruce
and
willow
and
over
the
niggerhead
swamps
a
faint
tinkle
of
bells
a
little
cloud
of
steam
for
in
the
great
cold
the
moisture
of
the
animals
breath
hangs
over
their
heads
in
the
still
air
and
on
looking
back
it
stands
awhile
along
the
course
at
dogs
height
until
it
is
presently
deposited
on
twigs
and
tussocks
we
wound
along
a
faint
tinkle
of
bells
a
little
cloud
of
steam
and
in
the
midst
of
the
cloud
a
tousle
of
shaggy
hair
and
pompons
going
out
of
the
dead
silence
behind
into
the
dead
silence
before
the
dusk
came
and
still
we
plodded
and
pushed
our
weary
way
swinging
that
heavy
sled
incessantly
by
the
gee
pole
in
front
and
the
behind
in
the
vain
effort
to
keep
it
on
the
trail
two
miles
an
hour
was
all
that
we
were
making
we
had
come
but
thirteen
or
fourteen
miles
out
of
and
it
was
dark
and
it
grew
colder
the
dogs
whined
and
stopped
every
few
yards
worn
out
by
wallowing
in
the
snow
and
the
labour
of
the
collar
the
long
scarfs
that
wrapped
our
mouths
and
noses
had
been
shifted
and
shifted
as
one
part
after
another
became
solid
with
ice
from
the
breath
until
over
their
whole
length
they
were
stiff
as
boards
after
two
more
miles
of
it
it
was
evident
that
we
could
not
reach
the
mail
cabin
that
night
then
i
made
my
last
and
worst
mistake
we
should
have
stopped
and
camped
then
and
there
we
had
tent
and
stove
and
everything
requisite
but
the
native
boy
insisted
that
the
cabin
was
only
little
way
and
any
one
who
knows
the
misery
of
making
camp
in
extremely
cold
weather
in
the
dark
will
understand
our
reluctance
to
do
so
i
decided
to
make
a
cache
of
the
greater
part
of
our
load
tent
and
stove
and
supplies
generally
and
to
push
on
to
the
cabin
with
but
the
bedding
and
the
grub
box
returning
for
the
stuff
in
the
morning
and
since
in
the
deepest
depths
of
blundering
there
is
a
deeper
still
by
some
one
carelessness
but
certainly
by
my
fault
the
axe
was
left
behind
in
the
cache
with
our
reduced
burden
we
made
better
progress
and
in
a
short
time
reached
the
end
of
the
portage
and
came
out
on
the
frozen
river
just
as
the
moon
a
day
or
two
past
the
full
rose
above
the
opposite
bank
one
sees
many
strange
distortions
of
sun
and
moon
in
this
land
but
never
was
a
stranger
seen
than
this
her
disk
shining
through
the
dense
air
of
the
river
bottom
was
in
shape
an
almost
perfect
octagon
regular
as
though
it
had
been
laid
off
with
dividers
and
a
ruler
we
were
soon
in
doubt
about
the
trail
the
had
gone
down
only
two
or
three
times
this
winter
and
each
time
had
taken
a
different
route
as
more
and
more
of
the
river
closed
and
gave
him
more
and
more
direct
passage
a
number
of
indians
had
been
hunting
and
their
tracks
added
to
the
tangle
of
trails
presently
we
entered
a
thick
mist
that
even
to
inexperienced
eyes
spoke
of
open
water
or
new
ice
yet
moist
so
heavy
was
the
vapour
that
to
the
man
at
the
the
man
at
the
gee
pole
loomed
ghostly
and
the
man
ahead
of
the
dogs
could
not
be
distinguished
at
all
we
had
gone
so
much
farther
than
our
native
boy
had
declared
we
had
to
go
that
we
began
to
fear
that
in
the
confusion
of
trails
we
had
taken
the
wrong
one
and
had
passed
the
cabin
that
is
the
tenderfoot
or
as
we
say
the
chechaco
fear
it
is
the
one
thing
that
it
may
almost
be
said
never
happens
but
the
boy
fell
down
completely
and
was
frankly
at
a
loss
all
we
could
get
out
of
him
was
we
catch
cabin
bymeby
no
if
we
had
passed
the
cabin
it
was
twenty
odd
miles
to
the
next
and
it
grew
colder
and
the
dogs
were
utterly
weary
again
prone
upon
the
trail
at
every
small
excuse
for
a
stop
only
to
be
stirred
by
the
whip
heavily
wielded
surely
never
men
thrust
themselves
foolhardily
into
worse
predicament
then
i
made
my
last
mistake
dimly
the
bank
loomed
through
the
mist
and
i
said
we
ca
go
any
farther
i
think
we
missed
the
trail
and
going
across
to
yon
bank
to
see
if
there
a
place
to
camp
i
had
not
gone
six
steps
from
the
trail
when
the
ice
gave
way
under
my
feet
and
i
found
myself
in
water
to
my
hips
sidenote
an
escapade
on
the
yukon
under
providence
i
owe
it
to
the
mukluks
i
wore
tied
tight
round
my
knees
that
i
did
not
lose
my
life
or
at
least
my
feet
the
thermometer
at
circle
city
stood
at
below
zero
at
dark
that
day
and
down
on
the
ice
it
is
always
about
colder
than
on
the
bank
because
cold
air
is
heavy
air
and
sinks
to
the
lowest
level
and
below
zero
means
below
freezing
my
breeches
froze
solid
the
moment
i
scrambled
out
but
not
a
drop
of
water
got
to
my
feet
if
the
water
had
reached
my
feet
they
would
have
frozen
almost
as
quickly
as
the
moose
hide
in
that
fearful
cold
thoroughly
alarmed
now
and
realising
our
perilous
situation
we
did
the
only
thing
there
was
to
do
we
turned
the
dogs
loose
and
abandoned
the
sled
and
went
back
along
the
trail
we
had
followed
as
fast
as
we
could
we
knew
that
we
could
safely
retrace
our
steps
and
that
the
trail
would
lead
us
to
the
bank
after
a
while
we
knew
not
where
the
trail
would
lead
us
in
the
other
direction
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
led
to
the
mail
cabin
two
miles
farther
on
and
the
was
at
that
time
occupying
it
at
the
end
of
his
day
run
the
dogs
stayed
with
the
sled
dogs
will
usually
stay
with
their
sled
they
seem
to
recognise
their
first
allegiance
to
the
load

as
walking
what
time
we
were
with
the

with
nothing
to

it
was
too
cold
to

for

in

to
this

had
been
in

none

took
any

it
was
a
providential
overruling
of
blundering
foolhardiness
for
which
we
were
deeply
thankful
the
next
day
a

with

there
were

visits

there
seems
no

there
was

was

man
married

into

dignified
it
by
the

the
great
literature
of
the
sacred
books
the
language
is
of
course
a
dying
one
english
is
slowly
superseding
it
but
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
for
a
generation
or
two
yet
to
come
it
will
be
the
basis
of
the
common
speech
of
the
people
and
the
language
of
worship
it
is
chiefly
in
matters
of
trading
and
handicrafts
that
english
is
taking
its
place
though
here
as
elsewhere
it
stands
to
the
discredit
of
the
civilised
race
that
blackguard
english
is
the
first
english
that
is
learned
there
seems
ground
to
question
whether
the
substitution
of
a
smattering
of
broken
english
for
the
flexibility
and
picturesque
expressiveness
of
an
indigenous
tongue
thoroughly
understood
carries
with
it
any
great
intellectual
gain
though
to
suggest
such
a
doubt
is
treason
to
some
minds
the
time
threatens
when
all
the
world
will
speak
two
or
three
great
languages
when
all
little
tongues
will
be
extinct
and
all
little
peoples
swallowed
up
when
all
costume
will
be
reduced
to
a
dead
level
of
blue
jeans
and
shoddy
and
all
strange
customs
abolished
the
world
will
be
a
much
less
interesting
world
then
the
spice
and
savour
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
will
be
gone
nor
does
it
always
appear
unquestionable
that
the
world
will
be
the
better
or
the
happier
the
advance
of
civilisation
would
be
a
great
thing
to
work
for
if
we
were
quite
sure
what
we
meant
by
it
and
what
its
goal
is
to
the
ordinary
government
in
alaska
with
some
notable
exceptions
it
seems
to
mean
chiefly
teaching
the
indians
to
call
themselves
and
and
teaching
the
women
to
wear
millinery
with
a
contemptuous
attitude
toward
the
native
language
and
all
native
customs
the

as

such
a
gathering
had
already
taken
place
in
preparation
for
the
christmas
holidays
when
we
reached
fort
yukon
on
the
of
december
it
would
have
been
pleasant
to
spend
christmas
with
them
but
we
were
due
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
at
bettles
for
that
feast
if
by
any
means
we
could
get
there
so
we
lingered
but
the
two
days
necessary
to
equip
ourselves
jimmy
had
torn
our
bedding
to
pieces
on
the
night
of
the
mishap
it
was
lashed
on
the
outside
of
the
load
and
he
had
scratched
and
clawed
it
to
make
a
nest
for
himself
until
fur
from
the
robe
and
feathers
from
the
quilts
were
all
over
the

the
other

not

warmly
coated

there

as

once
a
month
went
at
that
time
from
fort
yukon
to
the
koyukuk
and
there
was
little
other

the
course
lay
fifty
or
sixty
miles
across
country
to
the
chandalar
river
about
one
hundred
miles
up
that
stream
and
then
across
a
divide
to
the
south
fork
of
the
koyukuk
and
across
another
to
the
middle
fork
on
which
coldfoot
is
situated
it
is
not
possible
to
procure
any
supplies
save
sometimes
a
little
fish
for
dog
food
and
that
not
certainly
between
fort
yukon
and
coldfoot
so
that
provision
for
the
whole
journey
must
be
taken
sidenote
the
chandalar
a
new
indian
guide
had
been
engaged
as
far
as
coldfoot
and
we
set
out
three
men
two
toboggans
and
seven
dogs
four
on
the
larger
vehicle
and
three
on
the
smaller
one
of
the
dogs
brought
by
our
guide
three
miles
from
fort
yukon
we
crossed
the
porcupine
river
and
then
plunged
into
the
wilderness
of
lake
and
swamp
and
forest
that
stretches
north
of
the
yukon
a
portage
trail
as
such
a
track
across
country
is
called
to
distinguish
it
from
a
river
trail
has
the
advantage
of
such
protection
from
storm
as
its
timbered
stretches
afford
for
miles
and
miles
the
route
passes
through
scrub
spruce
that
has
been
burned
over
with
no
prospect
but
a
maze
of
charred
poles
against
the
snow
some
upright
others
at
every
angle
of
inclination
then
comes
a
lake
with
difficulty
in
finding
the
trail
on
its
surface
and
sometimes
much
casting
about
to
discover
where
it
leaves
the
lake
again
and
then
more
small
burned
timber
wherever
the
route
is
through
woods

or
dead
it
is

it
strikes

pitching

one
is
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
distant
mountains
and
at
the
intimation
they
bring
that
the
inexpressible
dreariness
of
the
yukon
flats
is
nearly
past
and
presently
the
trail
opens
suddenly
upon
the
broad
chandalar
the
hudson
bay
voyageurs
are
responsible
for
many
names
in
this
part
of
alaska
and
chandalar
is
a
corruption
of
their
gens
de

the
various
native
tribes
received
appellations
indicating
habitats
a
tribe
that
differed
from
most
northern
indians
in
having
no
permanent
villages
and
in
living
altogether
in
encampments
was
named
gens
de
large
and
the
river
which
they
frequented
took
their
name
it
is
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
yukon
and
in
general
its
waters
are
swift
and
shallow
not
navigable
for
steamboats
for
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
save
at
flood
and
not
easily
navigable
at
all
it
is
these
swift
shallow
streams
that
are
so
formidable
in
winter
on
account
of
overflow
water
and
the
chandalar
is
one
of
the
most
dreaded
sidenote
diphtheria
ten
miles
along
the
river
surface
brought
us
to
the
chandalar
native
village
a
settlement
of
half
a
dozen
cabins
and
or
thirty
souls
the
people
came
out
to
meet
us
and
said
they
were
just
about
to
bury
a
baby
and
asked
me
to
conduct
the
funeral
because
we
had
not
done
a
day
march
and
were
under
compulsion
to
push
on
at
our
best
speed
i
did
not
unlash
the
sled
but
went
just
as
i
was
up
the
hill
with
the
sorrowful
procession
to
the
little
graveyard
on
the
way
down
i
asked
as
best
i
could
of
what
sickness
the
baby
had
died
and
i
felt
some
uneasiness
when
the
throat
was
pointed
to
as
the
seat
of
disease
when
presently
i
was
informed
that
two
others
were
sick
and
of
the
same
complaint
my
uneasiness
became
alarm
i
went
at
once
to
see
them
and
the
angry
swollen
throats
patched
with
white
membrane
which
i
discovered
left
no
room
for
doubt
that
we
were
in
the
presence
of
another
outbreak
of
diphtheria
that
disease
had
scourged
the
yukon
in
the
two
preceding
years
children
died
at
fort
yukon
in
the
summer
of
half
a
dozen
at
circle
in
the
following
winter
though
that
outbreak
was
grappled
with
from
the
first
and
all
along
the
river
the
loss
of
life
was
terrible
there
was
no
question
that
we
must
give
up
all
hope
of
reaching
bettles
for
christmas
and
stay
and
do
what
we
could
for
these
people
so
we
made
camp
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
i
went
to
work
swabbing
out
the
throats
with
carbolic
acid
and
preparing
liquid
food
from
our
grub
box
there
was
nothing
to
eat
in
the
village
but
dried
fish
and
a
little
dried
moose
and
these
throats
like
iron
could
hardly
swallow
liquids
the
two
patients
were
a
boy
of
sixteen
and
a
grown
woman
it
was
evident
that
unless
we
could
isolate
them
the
disease
would
probably
pass
through
the
whole
village
and
indeed
others
might
have
been
infected
already
it
was
likely
that
we
were
in
for
a
siege
of
it
and
our
supply
of
condensed
milk
and
extract
of
beef
would
soon
be
exhausted
moreover
at
fort
yukon
was
the
trained
nurse
who
had
coped
with
the
epidemic
there
and
at
circle
while
we
had
virtually
no
experience
with
the
disease
at
all
it
was
resolved
to
send
back
to
fort
yukon
for
supplies
and
for
the
nurse
the
next
morning
knapp
and
the
native
boy
took
the
dogs
and
the
sled
and
started
back
with
no
load
save
a
little
grub
and
bedding
they
could
make
the
journey
in
two
days
a
day
must
be
allowed
for
preparations
and
with
the
aid
of
another
dog
team
two
days
more
would
bring
them
back
five
days
was
the
least
they
could
be
gone
it
was
asking
a
great
deal
of
this
lady
to
abandon
her
christmas
festival
preparations
for
which
had
long
been
making
and
to
come
miles
through
the
frozen
wilderness
in
a
toboggan
but
i
felt
sure
she
would
drop
everything
and
come
for
those
five
days
i
was
busied
in
close
attention
to
the
patients
and
in
strenuous
though
not
altogether
availing
efforts
to
maintain
a
quarantine
of
the
cabin
in
which
they
lay
there
was
little
more
that
i
could
do
than
swab
out
the
throats
and
administer
food
every
two
hours
as
the
disease
advanced
it
was
increasingly
painful
to
swallow
and
exceedingly
difficult
to
induce
the
sufferers
to
make
the
attempt
or
to
open
their
mouths
for
the
swabbing
after
two
or
three
days
the
woman
seemed
to
have
passed
the
crisis
of
the
disease
and
to
be
mending
but
the
boy
i
thought
grew
worse
one
becomes
attached
to
those
to
whom
one
ministers
and
this
poor
speechless
boy
with
his
terrible
throat
and
the
agony
in
his
big
black
eyes
appealed
to
me
very
strongly
indeed
it
was
torture
to
move
his
head
or
to
open
his
mouth
and
i
had
to
torture
him
continually
every
night
i
gathered
the
people
for
divine
service
here
was
a
little
community
far
off
in
the
wilds
that
had
carefully
conserved
and
handed
on
to
their
children
the
teaching
they
had
received
no
less
than
thirty
years
before
the
native
bibles
and
and
hymnals
were
brought
out
bearing
dates
of
publication
in
the
seventies
one
of
their
number
acted
as
leader
and
what
he
read
was
painfully
followed
in
the
books
they
lifted
their
voices
in
a
weird
transformation
of
familiar
tunes
with
quavers
and
glides
that
had
crept
in
through
long
uncorrected
use
and
amongst
the
prayers
said
was
one
for
our
sovereign
lady
queen
victoria
and
albert
edward
prince
of
wales
i
tried
to
explain
that
queen
victoria
was
dead
that
they
were
not
living
under
british
rule
and
i
took
a
pencil
and
struck
out
the
prayers
for
the
royal
family
from
the
books
but
there
was
doubt
in
their
minds
and
a
reluctance
to
alter
in
any
particular
the
liturgy
that
had
been
taught
them
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
intercessions
for
a
defunct
sovereign
of
another
land
still
arise
from
the
chandalar
village
one
can
not
but
feel
a
deep
admiration
for
the
pioneer
missionaries
of
this
region
bishop
bompas
archdeacon
macdonald
and
the
others
whose
teaching
was
so
thorough
and
so
lasting
and
who
lived
and
laboured
here
long
before
any
gold
seeker
had
thought
of
alaska
when
the
country
was
an
indian
country
exclusively
with
none
of
the
comforts
and
conveniences
that
can
now
be
enjoyed
it
was
to
a
remote
cabin
on
the
east
fork
of
this
river
that
archdeacon
macdonald
retired
for
a
year
to
make
part
of
his
translation
of
the
bible
according
to
the
indian
account
sidenote
the
shortest
day
at
noon
on
the
of
december
the
shortest
day
there
is
a
note
in
my
diary
that
i
saw
the
sun
disk
shining
through
the
trees
although
fully
half
a
degree
of
latitude
north
of
the
arctic
circle
the
refraction
is
sufficient
to
lift
his
whole
sphere
above
the
horizon
one
speculates
how
much
farther
north
it
would
be
possible
to
see
any
part
of
the
sun
at
noon
on
the
shortest
day
but
north
of
here
throughout
alaska
is
broken
and
mountainous
country
we
were
on
the
northern
edge
of
the
great
flat
of
the
interior
the
fifth
day
at
the
village
was
christmas
eve
my
boy
was
in
a
critical
condition
very
low
and
weak
with
a
temperature
that
stayed
around
and
as
night
approached
i
watched
with
the
greatest
anxiety
for
the
party
from
fort
yukon
and
just
as
the
last
lingering
glow
of
the
long
twilight
was
fading
from
the
south
there
was
a
distant
tinkle
of
bells
on
the
trail
and
faintly
once
and
again
a
man
voice
was
raised
in
command
and
i
knew
that
relief
was
at
hand
the
nurse
had
dropped
everything
and
had
come
as
i
felt
sure
she
would
gathering
medicines
and
supplies
and
hiring
a
native
dog
team
and
driver
she
had
left
immediately
and
the
round
trip
had
been
made
in
the
shortest
time
it
was
possible
to
make
it
it
was
a
tremendous
relief
to
see
her
step
out
of
the
rugs
and
robes
of
the
toboggan
and
take
charge
of
the
situation
in
her
quiet
competent
way
a
small
outlying
cabin
was
selected
for
a
hospital
the
family
that
occupied
it
bundled
out
into
a
tent
and
the
two
sick
persons
carefully
moved
into
it
with
whom
and
the
mother
of
the
sick
boy
the
nurse
took
up
her
abode
then
there
was
the
in
the
chief
cabin
with
little
gifts
for
the
children
sent
out
from
the
mission
at
fort
yukon
some
time
before
and
a
dance
afterward
for
christmas
festivities
must
go
on
whatever
happens
at
a
native
village
i
took
james
to
him
after
the
celebration
was
over
and
i
think
he
really
tried
to
smile
as
he
thanked
me
with
his
eyes
the
next
day
after
the
services
although
it
was
christmas
day
we
set
to
work
on
the
disinfecting
of
the
large
cabin
in
which
the
sick
had
lain
stringing
bedclothes
and
wearing
apparel
on
lines
from
wall
to
wall
and
stuffing
up
every
crack
and
cranny
with
cotton
we
burned
quantities
of
sulphur
that
the
nurse
had
brought
with
her
all
day
long
a
recent
article
in
a
stray
number
of
a
professional
journal
picked
up
in
the
office
of
a
medical

column
after
column

the
uselessness
of
all
known
methods
of

potash
chloride
of
lime
bichloride
of

the
author
knew
not
which
of
these
fetiches
to
be
most
sarcastic
about
it
may
be
that
the
net
result
of
our
copious
fumigation
was
but
the
bleaching
of
the
coloured
garments
hung
up
but
at
least
it
did
no
harm
one
sometimes
wishes
that
these
scientists
who
sit
up
so
high
in
the
seat
of
the
scornful
would
condescend
to
a
little
plain
instruction
the
serum
is
now
kept
in
readiness
at
all
our
missions
in
alaska
and
the
disease
seems
to
have
ceased
its
depredations
but
it
has
taken
terrible
toll
of
the
native
people
sidenote
the
missionary
nurse
we
wished
to
stay
with
the
nurse
until
the
sickness
should
be
done
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
and
insisted
upon
the
resumption
of
our
journey
it
did
not
seem
right
to
go
off
and
leave
this
lonely
woman
miles
from
the
nearest
white
person
to
cope
with
an
outbreak
of
disease
that
might
not
yet
have
spent
itself
although
there
had
been
no
new
case
for
a
week
you
done
your
work
here
now
leave
me
to
do
mine
you
not
get
to

hope
this
winter
if
you
stay
much
longer
are
you
afraid
to
stay
all
by
yourself
i
asked
somewhat
fatuously
afraid
afraid
of
what
you
surely
do
mean
afraid
of
the
natives
i
did
not
know
what
i
meant
it
seemed
not
unnatural
that
a
woman
with
such
prospect
before
her
should
be
a
little
timid
but
she
was
resolute
that
we
go
and
we
went
not
until
the
next
summer
did
i
learn
the
upshot
both
patients
recovered
and
there
was
no
other
case
six
years
later
when
these
words
are
written
i
have
just
baptized
a
son
of
the
boy

lay
so
ill

would

the
faint
of
dancing

dropped
down

it
is
strange
that
in
this
day
of
invention
and
improvement
in
artificial
illumination
a
candle
in
a
tin
can
is
still
the
most
dependable
light
for
the
trail
a
lamp
requires
a
glass
which
is
easily
broken
and
the
ordinary
that
comes
to
alaska
freezes
at
about
below
in
very
cold
weather
a
lantern
full
of
oil
will
go
out
completely
from
the
freezing
of
its
supply
all
the
various
acetylene
lamps
are
useless
because
water
is
required
to
generate
the
gas
and
water
may
not
be
had
without
stopping
and
building
a
fire
and
melting
ice
or
snow
the
electric
useful
enough
round
camp
goes
out
of
operation
altogether
on
the
trail
because
the
dry
cell
that
supplies
its
current
is
not
a
dry
cell
at
all
but
a
moist
cell
and
when
its
moisture
freezes
is
dead
until
it
thaws
out
again
no
extremity
of
cold
will
stop
a
candle
from
burning
and
if
it
be
properly
sheltered
by
the
tin
can
it
will
stand
a
great
deal
of
wind
the
folding
pocket
lantern
which
is
nothing
but
a
convenient
tin
can
with
mica
sides
is
the
best
equipment
for
travel

sometimes
easier

come

chandalar

in
these
parts

several

and
the
trail
was
hard
to
follow
one
track
we
pursued
led
us
up
a
bank
and
along
a
portage
and
presently
stopped
at
a
marten
trap
and
we
had
to
cut
across
to
the
river

cast
about

and
thither

these

noted
for
wind
and
the
chandalar
gap
which
had
loomed
before
us
since
daybreak
is
deservedly
in
especial
bad
repute
the
most
hateful
thing
in
the
arctic
regions
is
the
wind
cold

may
protect
one
self

there
is
no
adequate
protection

unfortunately
in
the
confusion
of
striking
the
tent
and
packing
in
the
dark
my
scarf
had
been
rolled
up
in
the
bedding
and
since
the
wind
was
not
bad
until
we
approached
the
gap
in
the
evening
i
had
not
troubled
about
it
now
as
we
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
wind
rose
constantly
the
thermometer
was
at
below
zero
and
wind
at
that
temperature
cuts
like
a
knife
but
to
get
my
scarf
meant
stopping
the
whole
procession
and
unlashing
and
unloading
the
sled
and
the
man
who
unlashed
in
that
wind
would
almost
certainly
freeze
his
fingers
so
i
gave
up
the
thought
of
it
turned
my
back
to
the
wind
while
i
tied
my
pocket
handkerchief
round
mouth

nose
drew
the
strings
of
my
parkee

close

then
faced
it
again

a
cold
lodging
the
cabin
was
just
the
other
side
of
the
gap
and
it
was
well
that
it
was
no
farther
for
we
were
weary
with
our
run
and
dangerously
cold
with
the
exposure
of
the
last
hour
it
was
rather
a
large
cabin
as
trail
cabins
go
with
a
rickety
stove
in
the
middle
burned
full
of
holes
and
it
was
hours
before
the
fire
began
to
make
any
impression
on
the
obstinate
sullen
cold
of
that
hut
when
we
went
to
bed
the
frost
still
stood
thick
and
heavy
on
the
walls
all
over
the
room
a
log
building
properly
constructed
is
a
warm
building

slowness
in
parting
with

slowness

a

cabin
that
has
been
unoccupied

a
long

in
very
cold
weather
is
hard
to
heat

evening

we
started
next
morning
the
thermometer
stood
at
below
zero
but
we
were
out
of
the
wind
region
and
did
not
mind
the
cold
it
is
curious
that
a
few
miles
on
either
side
of
that
gap
the
air
will
be
still
while
in
the
gap
itself
a
gale
is
blowing
seven
times
i
have
passed
through
that
gap
and
only
once
without
wind
the
great
flats
were
now
behind
us
we
had
passed
into
the
mountains
and
for
the
remainder
of
our
long
journey
we
should
scarce
ever
be
out
of
sight
of
mountains
again
up
the
river
with
its
constant
trouble
of
overflow
going
around
the
open
water
whenever
we
could
plunging
through
it
in
our
mukluks
when
it
could
not
be
avoided
with
the
care
of
the
dogs
feet
that
the
cold
weather
rendered
more
than
ever
necessary
when
they
got
wet
and
the
added
nuisance
of
throwing
the
toboggans
on
their
sides
and
beating
the
ice
from
them
with
the
flat
of
the
axe
wherever
water
had
been
passed
through
for
two
days
we
followed
its
windings
the
thermometer
between
and
the
mountains
rising
higher
and
the
scenery
growing
more
picturesque
as
we
advanced
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
from
the
gap
we
were
at
the
mouth
of
the
west
fork
of
the
chandalar
and
after
passing
up
it
for
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
we
left
that
watercourse
to
cross
the
mountains
to
the
south
fork
of
the
koyukuk
river
then
began
hard
labour
again
a
toboggan
is
not
a
good
vehicle
for
crossing
summits
its
bottom
is
perfectly
flat
and
smooth
polished
like
glass
by
the
friction
of
the
snow
if
the
trail
be
at
all
sidling
and
mountain
trails
are
almost
always
sidling
the
toboggan
swings
off
on
the
side
of
the
inclination
and
must
be
kept
on
the
trail
by
main
force
the
runners
of
a
sled
will
grip
the
surface
if
there
be
any
inequalities
at
all
but
a
toboggan
swings
now
this
way
and
now
that
like
a
great
pendulum
dragging
the
near
dogs
with
it
again
and
again
we
had
to
hitch
both
teams
to
one
toboggan
to
get
up
a
sidling
pitch
while
all
hands
kept
the
vehicle
on
the
trail
and
our
progress
was
painful
and
slow
in
soft
snow
on
a
level
surface
like
the
river
bed
or
through
the
flat
country
generally
the
toboggan
is
much
the
more
convenient
vehicle
for
it
rides
over
the
snow
instead
of
ploughing
through
it
but
on
hard
snow
anywhere
or
on
grades
the
toboggan
is
a
nuisance
thus
wallowing
through
the
deep
snow
at
the
side
of
the
toboggans
to
hold
them
in
place
we
sweated
and
slaved
our
way
mile
after
mile
up
the
gradual
ascent
until
we
reached
the
spot
just
under
a
shoulder
of
the
summit
where
there
was
dry
spruce
and
green
spruce
for
camping
the
dry
for
fire
and
the
green
for
couch
and
there
we
halted
for
the
night

next
morning
we
crossed
the
low
pass
and
dropped
down
easily
into
the
wide
valley
of
the
koyukuk
south
fork
with
a
fine
prospect
of
mountains
everywhere
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
i
had
stood
and
gazed
upon
those
same
mountains
on
my
journey
of
the
previous
winter
my
first
winter
in
alaska
and
had
seen
a
most
remarkable
sight
as
we
began
the
descent
and
a
turn
of
the
trail
gave
a
new
panorama
of
peaks
i
did
not
at
first
realise
the
nature
of
the
peculiar
phenomenon
i
was
gazing
at
each
peak
had
a
fine
filmy
cloud
stretching
straight
out
from
it
into
the
sky
waving
and
shimmering
as
it
stretched
the
sun
was
not
above
the
horizon
but
his
rays
caught
these
sheer
streamers
and
played
upon
them
with
a
most
delicate
opalescent
radiance
then
all
at
once
came
to
my
mind
the
recollection
of
a
description
in
john
of
surely
the
finest
mountain
book
ever
written
of
the
snow
banners
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
i
knew
that
i
was
looking
at
a
similar
spectacle
it
meant
that
a
storm
was
raging
on
high
although
so
far
we
were
sheltered
from
it
it
meant
that
the
dry
snow
of
the
mountain
flanks
was
driven
up
those
flanks
so
fiercely
before
the
wind
that
it
was
carried
clean
over
them
and
beyond
them
out
into
the
sky
and
still
had
such
pressure
behind
it
that
it
continued
its
course
and
spread
out
horizontally
thinning
and
spreading
for
maybe
a
mile
before
it
lost
all
coherence
and
visibility
as
far
as
i
could
see
mountain
peaks
i
could
see
the
snow
banners
all
pointing
one
way
all
waving
all
luminous
and
shimmering
in
the
it
was
a
very
noble
sight
and
i
gazed
a
long
while
entranced
not
knowing
how
ominous
it
was
when
we
reached
the
valley
and
left
the
shelter
of
the
gulch
we
struck
the
full
force
of
that
fearful
gale
and
for
two
days
and
nights
of
incessant
blizzard
we
lay
in
a
hole
dug
out
of
a
for
we
had
no
tent
that
year
the
trail
lost
the
grub
box
nearly
empty
and
no
fire
possible
to
cook
anything
with
had
the
grub
box
been
full
the
valley
before
us
to
resume
the
narrative
is
a
high
region
of
niggerhead
and
swamp
the
of
the
south
fork
of
the
koyukuk
river
the
trail
descends
one
of
its
southern
draws
follows
up
the
main
valley
awhile
crosses
it
and
leaves
by
one
of
its
northern
draws
to
pass
over
the
mountains
that
separate
its
drainage
from
the
main
fork
of
the
koyukuk
the
cold
had
given
place
to
wind
and
though
the
gale
did
not
approach
the
fierceness
of
last
year
storm
it
gave
great
trouble
in
following
the
track
these
high
headwater
basins
are
always
windy
the
timber
is
scrubby
spruce
with
many
open
places
and
in
such
open
places
the
trail
is
soon
obliterated
altogether
when
the
light
fails
this
casting
about
for
blazes
whenever
a
clump
of
spruce
is
reached
becomes
increasingly
slow
and
difficult
and
at
last
becomes
hopeless
the
general
direction
determined
it
might
be
thought
that
the
traveller
could
ignore
the
tracks
of
previous
passage
and
strike
out
for
himself
but
he
knows
that
the
trail
however
rough
is
at
least
practicable
whereas
an
independent
course
may
soon
lead
to
steep
gullies
or
cut
banks
or
may
entangle
him
in
some
thicket
that
he
must
resort
to
the
axe
to
pass
through
moreover
even
two
or
three
passages
through
the
snow
in
the
winter
will
give
some
bottom
to
a
trail
a
bottom
that
when
the
areas
are
passed
and
the
are
resumed
both
he
and
his
dogs
will
be
thankful
for
sidenote
camp
making
so
we
made
a
camp
as
it
darkened
to
night
not
far
from
the
spot
where
i
had
siwashed
with
an
indian
companion
the
previous
winter
the
wind
blowing
half
a
gale
at
below
zero
making
camp
under
such
circumstances
is
always
a
very
disagreeable
proceeding
it
takes
time
and
care
to
make
a
comfortable
camp
and
time
and
care
in
the
wind
and
the
cold
involve
suffering
two
suitable
trees
must
be
selected
between
which
the
tent
is
to
be
suspended
by
the
and
the
snow
must
all
be
scraped
away
by
the
or
if
it
be
too
deep
beaten
down
then
while
one
man
unlashes
and
unpacks
the
sleds
another
cuts
green
spruce
and
lays
it
all
over
the
tent
space
thicker
and
finer
where
the
bed
is
to
be
then
up
goes
the
tent
its
corner
ropes
and
its
side
strings
made
fast
to
boughs
if
there
be
such
or
to
stakes
or
to
logs
laid
parallel
to
the
sides
then
the
stovepipe
is
jointed
and
the
stove
set
up
on
the
edge
of
green
billets
properly
shaped
meanwhile
the
the
green
boughs
cut
has
been
felling
and
splitting
a
dry
tree
for
stove
wood
and
the
whole
proceedings
are
rushed
and
hastened
towards
getting
a
fire
in
that
stove
sometimes
it
is
a
question
whether
we
shall
get
a
fire
before
we
freeze
our
fingers
or
freeze
our
fingers
before
we
get
a
fire
the
fire
once
going
we
are
safe
for
however
much
more
work
there
is
in
the
open
and
there
is
always
a
good
deal
more
one
can
go
to
the
tent
to
get
warm
enough
stove
wood
must
be
cut
not
only
for
night
and
morning
but
for
cooking
the
dog
feed
the
dog
pot
filled
with
snow
into
which
the
fish
are
cut
up
is
put
upon
the
outdoor
fire
as
soon
as
begins
cooking
in
the
tent
when
it
boils
the
rice
and
tallow
must
be
added
and
when
the
rice
has
boiled
twenty
minutes
the
whole
is
set
aside
to
cool
meanwhile
the
two
aluminum
pots
full
of
snow
replenished
from
time
to
time
as
it
melts
are
put
upon
the
stove
in
the
tent
as
the
necessary
preliminary
to
cooking
sometimes
ice
and
more
rarely
water
may
be
had
and
then
supper
is
hastened
if
we
are
camped
on
the
river
bank
sometimes
a
fired
straight
down
into
the
ice
will
penetrate
to
the
water
below
and
allow
a
little
jet
to
bubble
up
melting
snow
is
a
tedious
business
at
best
but
since
three
times
out
of
four
when
camping
it
must
be
done
the
aluminum
pots
are
a
treasure
there
is
still
work
for
every
one
as
well
as
the
cook
snow
must
be
banked
all
round
the
tent
to
keep
out
the
wind
little
heaps
of
spruce
boughs
must
be
cut
for
the
dogs
beds
it
is
all
we
can
do
for
them
whatever
the
weather
and
they
appreciate
it
highly
it
may
be
that
dog
moccasins
must
be
taken
off
and
strung
around
the
stove
to
dry
and
before
supper
is
ready
the
inside
of
the
tent
is
heavy
with
all
sorts
of
drying
socks
moccasins
scarfs
toques
mittens
one
of
the
earliest
habits
a
man
learns
on
the
trail
is
to
hang
up
everything
to
dry
as
soon
as
he
takes
it
off
why
should
it
be
hung
up
to
dry
unless
it
has
got
wet
the
writer
was
once
asked
in
detailing
these
operations
because
there
is
no
other
way
to
remove
the
ice
with
which
everything
becomes
incrusted
in
very
cold
weather
sidenote
camp
cooking
as
his
snow
melts
the
cook
throws
into
the
pot
a
few
handfuls
of
evaporated
potatoes
a
handful
of
evaporated
onions
and
smaller
quantities
of
evaporated
soup
vegetables
and
leaves
them
to
soak
and
simmer
and
resume
their
original
size
and
flavour
by
and
by
he
will
cut
up
the
moose
meat
or
the
rabbits
or
birds
or
whatever
game
he
may
have
and
throw
it
in
and
in
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
there
will
be
a
savoury
stew
that
with
a
pan
of
biscuits
cooked
in
an
aluminum
reflector
beside
the
stove
and
a
big
pot
of
tea
constitutes
the
principal
meal
of
the
day
or
if
the
day
has
been
long
and
sleep
seems
more
attractive
even
than
grub
he
will
turn
some
frozen
beans
already
boiled
into
a
with
a
big
lump
of
butter
and
when
his
meat
is
done
supper
is
ready
beans
thus
prepared
eaten
red
hot
with
grated
cheese
are
delicious
to
a
hungry
man
with
the
stove
for
a
sideboard
food
may
always
be
eaten
hot
and
that
is
one
advantage
of
camp
fare
the
men
satisfied
the
dogs
remain
and
while
two
of
the
party
wash
dishes
and
clean
up
the
third
feeds
the
dogs
their
pot
of
food
has
been
cooling
for
an
hour
or
more
they
will
not
eat
it
until
it
is
cold
and
a
mess
of
rice
will
hold
heat
a
long
time
even
in
the
coldest
weather
when
it
is
nearly
cold
it
is
dished
out
with
a
paddle
into
the
individual
pans
and
the
dogs
make
short
work
of
it
there
are
some
who
feed
straight
fish
and
if
the
fish
be
king
salmon
of
the
best
quality
the
dogs
do
well
enough
on
it
but
on
any
long
run
it
is
decidedly
economical
to
cook
for
the
dogs
not
so
much
from
the
standpoint
of
direct
cost
as
from
that
of
weight
and
ease
of
hauling
an
hundred
pounds
of
fish
plus
an
hundred
pounds
of
rice
plus
fifty
pounds
of
tallow
will
go
a
great
deal
farther
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
fish
alone
there
is
little
doubt
too
that
in
the
long
run
the
dogs
do
better
on
cooked
food
it
is
easier
of
digestion
and
easier
to
apportion
in
uniform
rations
rice
and
fish
make
excellent
food
the
japs
took
port
arthur
on
rice
and
fish
the
tallow
answers
a
demand
of
the
climate
and
is
increased
as
the
weather
grows
colder
man
and
dog
alike
require
quantities
of
fat
food
in
this
climate
it
is
astonishing
how
much
bacon
and
butter
one
can
eat
when
the
dogs
have
eaten
and
each
one
has
made
the
rounds
of
all
the
other
pans
to
be
sure
nothing
is
left
they
retire
to
their
respective
nests
of
spruce
bough
and
curl
themselves
up
with
many
turnings
round
and
much
rearranging
of
the
litter
feet
and
nose
are
neatly
tucked
in
the
tail
is
adjusted
carefully
over
all
the
hair
on
the
body
stands
straight
up
and
the
dogs
have
gone
to
bed
and
do
not
like
to
be
disturbed
again
sidenote
therein
lies
the
cruelty
of
depriving
them
of
their
tails
which
used
to
be
the
general
custom
in
this
country
the
old
tandem
harness
almost
required
it
as
the
breath
of
the
dog
behind
condensed
upon
the
tail
of
the
dog
in
front
until
he
was
carrying
around
permanently
a
mass
of
ice
that
was
a
burden
to
him
and
rendered
his
tail
useless
for
warmth
but
the
rig
with
a
long
mid
rope
to
which
the
dogs
are
attached
by
in
such
manner
that
they
may
at
will
be
hitched
abreast
or
one
ahead
of
the
other
as
the
trail
is
wide
or
narrow
is
superseding
the
tandem
rig
and
one
sees
more
bushy
tails
amongst
the
dogs
the
thick
tail
of
the
dog
in
this
country
is
indeed
his
blanket
and
in
cold
weather
the
tailless
dog
is
at
a
great
disadvantage
it
was
said
that
all
the
dogs
retired
to
the
nests
of
spruce
bough
it
should
have
been
all
but
one
it
is
lingo
special
charge
to
guard
the
sled
and
his
special
privilege
to
sleep
on
it
turning
around
and
curling
up
on
the
softest
spot
he
can
find
of
the
unlashed
and
partly
unloaded
toboggan
he
will
not
touch
anything
it
contains
nor
permit
any
other
dog
to
touch
it
the
northern
skies
are
clouded
the
next
morning
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
and
there
is
a
ruddy
dawn
that
is
glorious
to
behold
the
white
earth
gives
back
a
soft
rose
tint
as
an
organ
pipe
gives
back
a
faint
tone
to
the
strong
vibration
of
another
pipe
in
pitch
with
it
we
shall
not
see
the
sun
himself
any
more
for
many
weeks
but
we
see
his
light
upon
the
flanks
of
the
mountains
for
an
hour
or
so
around
noon
the
bold
shapely
peaks
of
the
south
fork
of
the
koyukuk
turn
their
snows
to
pink
fire
as
his
rays
slowly
descend
their
sides
and
the
whole
scene
is
exquisitely
beautiful
what
a
wonderful
thing
colour
is
when
the
skies
are
overcast
this
is
a
dead
country
in
winter
for
spruce
the
prevailing
wood
is
black
in
the
mass
at
a
little
distance
gaze
where
one
will
there
is
naught
but
black
and
white
the
eye
becomes
tired
of
the
monotony
and
longs
for
some
warmer
tone
that
is
surely
the
reason
why
all
those
who
live
in
the
country
cherish
some
gay
article
of
attire
why
the
natives
love
brilliant
handkerchiefs
why
the
white
man
also
will
choose
a
crimson
scarf
trudging
at
the
i
have
found
pleasure
in
the
red
pompons
of
the
dogs
harness
in
the
gay
beading
of
mitten
and
and
that
is
why
a
lavish
feast
of
colour
such
as
this
dawn
stirs
one
spirit
with
such
keen
delight
it
gives
life
to
a
dead
world
but
the
wind
is
still
bitter
and
interferes
sadly
with
one
enjoyment
all
through
the
valley
up
the
creek
by
which
we
leave
it
past
the
twin
lakes
on
the
low
summit
the
wind
grows
in
force
and
when
we
leave
slate
creek
for
the
present
and
make
a
portage
over
a
mountain
shoulder
to
strike
the
creek
again
much
lower
down
the
wind
has
risen
to
a
gale
that
overturns
the
toboggans
and
makes
the
men
fight
for
their
footing
the
actual
physical
labour
of
it
is
enormous
and
there
can
be
no
rest
it
is
too
bitterly
cold
in
that
blast
to
stop
for
a
mile
or
two
we
struggle
and
slave
to
beat
our
way
around
that
mountain
shoulder
and
then
drop
down
to
the
creek
again
the
blessed
relief
it
is
to
get
out
of
the
fury
of
that
wind
into
the
comparative
shelter
of
the
creek
to
be
done
with
the
ceaseless
toil
of
holding
the
heavy
toboggans
from
hurtling
down
the
hillside
to
be
able
to
keep
one
feet
without
continually
slipping
and
falling
on
the
snow
no
words
can
adequately
convey
we
are
all
frozen
again
a
little

is
touched

man
cheeks
and

sidenote
the
koyukuk
gold
camp
on
the
middle
fork
of
the
koyukuk
at
the
mouth
of
slate
creek
coldfoot
sits
within
a
cirque
of
rugged
mountain
peaks
the
most
northerly
postal
town
in
the
interior
of
alaska
the
most
northerly
town
in
the
world
as
it
claims
it
sprang
into
existence
in
and
flourished
for
a
season
or
two
with
the
usual
accompaniments
of
such
florification
in
it
was
already
much
decayed
and
is
now
dead
ever
since
its
start
the
koyukuk
camp
has
steadily
produced
gold
and
given
occupation
to
miners
numbering
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
three
hundred
but
the
scene
of
operations
and
therefore
the
depot
for
supplies
has
continually
changed
in
the
chief
producing
creek
was
myrtle
which
is
a
tributary
of
slate
creek
and
the
town
at
the
mouth
was
in
eligible
situation
though
much
from
the
first
then
the
centre
of
interest
shifted
to
nolan
creek
fifteen
miles
farther
up
the
river
which
is
a
tributary
of
wiseman
creek
and
the
town
of
wiseman
sprang
up
at
the
mouth
of
that
creek
the
the
commissioner
office
and
the
saloon
the
stores
and
migrated
to
the
new
spot
and
coldfoot
was
abandoned
now
the
chief
producing
creek
is
the
hammond
river
still
farther
up
the
koyukuk
and
if
its
placer
deposits
prove
as
rich
as
they
promise
it
is
likely
that
a
town
will
spring
up
at
the
mouth
of
the
hammond
which
will
supersede
wiseman
there
has
never
been
found
a
continuous
in
the
koyukuk
camp
it
is
what
is
known
as
a
pocket
camp
now
and
again
a
spot
is
found
which
enriches
its
discoverers
while
on
the
claims
above
and
below
that
spot
the
ground
may
be
too
poor
to
work
at
a
profit
for
ground
must
be
rich
to
be
worked
at
all
in
the
koyukuk
it
is
the
most
expensive
camp
in
alaska
perhaps
in
the
world
this
is
due
to
its
remoteness
and
difficulty
of
access
far
north
of
the
arctic
circle
the
diggings
are
about
miles
above
the
head
of
steamboat
navigation
and
more
than
six
hundred
miles
above
the
confluence
of
the
koyukuk
with
the
yukon
transshipped
at
nulato
to
the

make
three
or
four

all

the

of

the

the

is
much
higher
than
on
the
yukon
or
on
the
other
tributaries
of
that
river
the
very
smallness
of
the
camp
is
a
factor
in
the
high
prices
for
there
is
not
trade
enough
to
induce
brisk
competition
with
the
reduction
of
rates
that
competition
brings
sidenote
miners
generosity
yet
the
smallness
and
the
isolation
of
the
camp
have
their
compensations
there
is
more
community
life
more
de
amongst
the
koyukuk
miners
than
will
be
found
in
any
other
camp
in
alaska
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
for
amusement
social
gatherings
are
more
common
and
are
made
more
of
and
hospitality
is
universal
like
all
sparsely
settled
and
frontier
lands
alaska
is
a
very
hospitable
place
in
general
but
the
koyukuk
has
earned
the
name
of
the
most
hospitable
camp
in
alaska
since
the
numbers
are
small
and
each
man
is
well
known
to
all
the
others
any
sickness
or
suffering
makes
an
immediate
appeal
and
brings
a
generous
response
again
and
again
the
unfortunate
victim
of
accident
or
disease
has
been
sent
outside
for
treatment
the
considerable
money
required
being
quickly
raised
by
public
subscription
there
is
probably
no
other
gold
camp
in
the
world
where
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
owner
of
a
good
claim
to
tell
a
neighbour
who
is
broke
to
take
a
pan
and
go
down
to
the
drift
and
help
himself
until
my
visit
of
the
previous
year
no
minister
of
religion
of
any
sort
had
penetrated
to
the
koyukuk
and
save
for
one
journey
thither
by
bishop
rowe
my
annual
visits
have
been
the
only
opportunities
for
public
worship
since
it
will
suffice
for
the
visit
now
describing
as
well
as
for
all
the
others
to
say
that
the
reception
was
most
cordial
and
the
opportunity
much
appreciated
we
went
from
creek
to
creek
and
gathered
the
men
and
the
few
women
in
whatever
cabin
was
most
convenient
and
no
clergyman
could
wish
for
more
attentive
or
interested
congregations

the

stood
at

although
it
had
been
no
lower
than
below
when
we
left
the
last

some
fifteen
miles
away
as
a
general
rule
the
temperature
on
these
mountain
creeks
which
are
at
some
considerable
elevation
above
the
river
into
which
they
flow
will
read
from
to
higher
than
on

and
if
one
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
peaks
around

the

then
would
probably
be

at
the
summit
between
fairbanks
and

country
in

sidenote

this
interesting
fact
which
surprises
a
good
many
people
for
we
are
used
to
think
of
elevated
places
as
cold
places
is
due
to
the
greater
heaviness
of
cold
air
which
sinks
to
the
lowest
level
it
can
reach
and
the
river
bed
is
the
lowest
part
of
the
country
it
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
to
what
extent
this
rule
holds
good
the
ridges
and
the
hilltops
are
always
the
warmest
places
in
cold
weather
would
this
hold
as
regards
mountain
tops
as
regards
high
mountain
tops
probably
it
would
hold
in
the
sunshine
but
the
rapid
radiation
of
heat
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
mountain
tops
would
swing
the
balance
the
other
way
after
dark
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
the
coldest
place
in
cold
weather
in
alaska
is
the
river
surface
and
it
is
on
the
river
surface
that
most
of
our
travelling
is
done
the
night
we
returned
to
coldfoot
we
put
our
toboggan
up
high
on
the
roof
of
an
outhouse
to
keep
its
skin
sides
from
the
teeth
of
some
hungry
native
dogs
leaving
some
of
the
load
that
was
not
required
within
it
covered
by
the
sled
cloth
later
on
i
saw
by
the
light
of
the
moon
lingo
silhouetted
figure
sitting
bolt
upright
on
top
of
the
sled
and
he
gave
his
short
double
bark
as
i
drew
near
to
make
me
notice
that
he
was
still
doing
his
duty
although
under
difficulties
the
dog
had
climbed
up
a
and
had
jumped
to
the
top
of
the
outhouse
and
so
to
the
sled
i
thought
of
kipling
that
fought
at
for
fatigue
it
was
their
pride
and
they
would
be
denied
to
clean
the
floor
here
at
coldfoot
we
came
first
into
contact
with
that
interesting
tribe
of
wandering
inland
esquimaux
known
as
the
kobuks
from
their
occupation
of
the
river
of
that
name
the
koyukuk
has
its
own
indian
people
but
these
enterprising
kobuks
have
pushed
their
way
farther
and
farther
from
salt
water
into
what
used
to
be
exclusive
indian
territory
representatives
of
both
races
were
at
coldfoot
and
as
we
lay
for
a
couple
of
days
i
was
enabled
to
renew
last
acquaintance
with
them
though
without
a
good
interpreter
not
much
progress
was
made
the
delight
of
these
people
at
the
phonograph
the
first
they
had
ever
heard
was
some
compensation
for
the
incessant
snarl
and
scream
of
the
instrument
itself
it
was
very
funny
to
see
them
sitting
on
the
floor
roaring
with
laughter
at
one
particularly
silly
spoken
record
of
the
uncle
josh
at
the
world
fair
order
over
and
over
again
they
would
ask
for
that
record
and
it
never
ceased
to
convulse
them
with
laughter
he
been
enjoyin
poor
health
lately
but
this
mornin
i
heard
him
complain
that
he
felt
a
little
better
how
sick
and
tired
we
got
of
this
and
similar
jokes
drawled
out
a
dozen
times
running
the
natives
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
it
was
the
human
voice
with
its
pronounced
unusual
inflections
that
aroused
their
merriment
the
phonograph
is
becoming
a
powerful
agency
for
disseminating
a
knowledge
of
english
amongst
the
natives
throughout
alaska
and
one
wishes
that
it
were
put
to
better
use
than
the
reproduction
of
silly
and
often
vulgar
monologue
and
dialogue
and
trashy
ragtime
music
as
an
index
of
the
taste
of
those
who
purchase
records
the
selection
brought
to
this
country
points
low
the
third
day
the
thermometer
stood
at
and
we
were
free
to
leave
without
actually
breaking
the
rule
we
had
made
after
the
escapade
on
the
yukon
two
other
teams
were
going
down
the
river
so
we
started
with
them
on
the
mile
journey
to
bettles
twenty
miles
or
so
below
coldfoot
the
koyukuk
passes
for
several
miles
in
a
narrow
channel
between
steep
rock
bluffs
with
here
and
there
great
detached
masses
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
river
one
has
a
grotesque
resemblance
to
an
aged
bishop
in
his
vestments
and
is
known
as
the
bishop
rock
another
a
more
remote
likeness
to
an
indian
woman
and
this
is
known
as
the
squaw
rock
this
part
of
the
river
which
is
called
the
cañon
of
the
koyukuk
though
it
is
not
a
true
cañon
is
very
picturesque
and
because
of
frequent
overflow
offers
glare
ice
and
swift
passage
to
the
traveller
when
it
does
not
embarrass
him
with
running
water
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
pass
it
without
getting
our
dogs
feet
wet
and
made
the
in
a
brilliant
moon
that
rendered
travelling
at
night
pleasanter
than
during
the
day
sidenote
travelling
at
below
the
next
day
we
started
again
at
near
below
but
because
there
was
a
good
trail
and
a
for
noon
the
travelling
was
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
if
there
be
a
warm
house
to
break
the
day
march
and
eat
in
where
scarfs
and
parkees
and
caps
and
mittens
may
be
dried
out
with
a
warm
outhouse
where
the
dogs
may
rest
in
comfort
travelling
in
such
weather
is
not
too
risky
or
too
severely
trying
the
continual
condensation
of
the
moisture
from
the
breath
upon
everything
about
the
head
and
face
is
a
decided
inconvenience
and
when
it
condenses
upon
the
and
the
upper
and
the
lower
lashes
freeze
together
the
ice
must
be
removed
or
it
is
impossible
to
open
the
eyes
this
requires
the
momentary
application
of
the
bare
hand
and
every
time
it
goes
back
into
the
mitten
it
carries
some
moisture
with
it
so
that
after
a
while
mittens
are
wet
as
well
as
moreover
there
is
always
a
certain
perspiration
that
condenses
one
gets
into
the
habit
of
turning
the
duffel
lining
of
the
mitts
inside
out
and
hanging
them
up
the
moment
one
gets
inside
a
cabin
round
every
stove
there
is
a
rack
constructed
for
just
that
purpose
there
is
no
more
striking
phenomenon
of
the
arctic
trail
than
the
behaviour
of
smoke
in
cold
weather
as
one
approaches
a
and
to
greater
degree
a
village
or
a
town
it
is
seen
enveloped
in
mist
although
there
be
no
open
water
to
account
for
it
and
the
prospect
in
every
other
direction
be
brilliantly
clear
it
is
not
mist
at
all
it
is
merely
the
smoke
from
the
stovepipes
and
the
explanation
is
simple
although
not
all
at
once
arrived
at
smoke
rises
because
it
is
warmer
than
the
air
into
which
it
is
discharged
for
that
and
no
other
reason
now
when
smoke
is
discharged
into
air
at
a
temperature
of
below
zero
it
is
deprived
of
its
heat
immediately
and
falls
to
the
ground
by
its
greater
specific
gravity
the
smoke
may
be
observed
just
issuing
from
the
pipe
or
rising
but
a
few
feet
and
then
curling
downward
to
be
diffused
amidst
the
air
near
the
ground
it
was
to
such
a
inn
that
we
pulled
up
to
warm
and
refresh
ourselves
and
our
team
for
the
twenty
miles
that
remained
of
the
day

we
had
almost
reached
the
limit
of
koyukuk
bettles
being
the
head
of
navigation
and
merchandise
late
in
the
season
finding
water
too
shallow
for
transport
to
the
diggings
there
is
more
or
less
freighting
with
dog
teams
and
horses
all
the
winter
this
travel
keeps
open
the

the
route
from
an
outside
point
of
view
they
may
appear
rough
and
the
fare
coarse
the
night
accommodation
is
a
double
row
of
bunks
on
each
side
of
a
long
room
with
a
great
stove
in
the
middle
sometimes
there
is
straw
in
the
bunks
sometimes
spruce
boughs
in
the
better
class
even
sometimes
mattresses
but
to
the
weary
traveller
who
has
battled
with
the
storm
or
endured
the
intense
cold
for
hours
at
a
stretch
they
are
glad

are

the
usual
explanation
that
the
cloud
acts
as
a
blanket
that
checks
the
radiation
of
heat
from
the
earth
is
one
of
those
explanations
that
do
not

there

to
radiate
the
cloud
is
a
mass
of
moist
air
which
is
warm
air
introducing
itself
from
some
milder
region
so
the

brings
the

the

extract
it
and
thereby
discharge
the
moisture

there
was

snow
then
the
skies
cleared
because
they
were
discharged
of

their

and
the

went
down

three
times
a

every

the

the

every

the

the

because
the
barometer
gives
notice
of
changes
in
the

of

it
is
valuable
in

in
our

well
is
this
established
that
during
spells
at
fairbanks
impatient
travellers
and

would
busy
the
hospital
telephone
with
inquiries
about
the

the
hospital
having
the
only

in
the

after
another
long
cold
run
on
the
night
of
friday
the
of
january
we
reached
bettles
the
place
we
had
planned
to
spend
christmas
at
we
were
unable
to
stir
from
bettles
for
two
solid
weeks
for
during
the
whole
of
that
time
the
thermometer
never
rose
above
below

the
long
wait
at

would
have
been
excessively
tedious
had
it
not
been
for
the
kind
hospitality
of

charles
grimm
the
commercial
company
agent
and
his
wife
and
this
is
but
one
of
many
times
that
i
have
been
under
obligation
to
them
for
cordial
welcome
and
entertainment
for
needs
anticipated
and
every
sort
of
assistance
gladly
rendered
we
had
been
expected
many
days
the
christmas
festivities
with
a
gathering
of
natives
of
both
races
had
come
and
gone
still
they
looked
for
us
for
in
this
country
one
does
not
give
a
man
up
merely
because
he
is
a
few
weeks
behind
time
nor
hold
him
to
account
for
unpunctuality
the
natives
remained
for
the
most
part
and
there
was
abundant
opportunity
of
intercourse
with
them
and
some
beginnings
of
instruction
as
the
days
passed
and
all
arrangements
for
our
advance
were
made
we
chafed
more
and
more
at
the
delay
for
it
was
very
plain
that
the
prospect
of
visiting
point
hope
grew
less
and
less
but
this
is
a
great
country
for
teaching
patience
and
resignation
sidenote
paraselenæ
some
of
the
weather
during
that
two
weeks
wait
was
of
quite
exceptional
severity
one
night
is
fixed
for
ever
in
my
memory
it
is
a
very
rare
thing
for
the
wind
to
blow
in
the
strong
cold
but
that
night
there
was
a
wind
at
below
zero
and
high
up
in
the
heavens
was
a
sight
i
had
never
seen
before
the
moon
little
past
her
full
had
a
great
ring
around
her
faintly
prismatic
and
equidistant
from
her
where
a
line
through
her
centre
parallel
with
the
horizon
would
cut
the
ring
were
two
other
moons
distinct
and
clear
it
was
a
strangely
beautiful
thing
this
sight
of
three
moons
sailing
aloft
through
the
starry
sky
as
though
the
beholder
had
been
suddenly
translated
to
some
planet
that
enjoys
a
plurality
of
satellites
but
no
living
being
could
stand
long
at
gaze
in
that
wind
and
that
cold
a
perfect
paraselene
is
i
am
convinced
an
extremely
rare
thing
much
rarer
than
a
perfect
parhelion
my
companion
thought
the
phenomenon
should
be
called
saving
the
canine
simile
for
the
sun
for
in
seven
years
travel
i
have
never
seen
another
and
the
references
to
it
in
literature
are
few
the
next
day
at
noon
the
sun
not
visible
above
the
distant
mountains
there
appeared
in
the
sky
a
great
shining
cross
of
orange
light
just
over
the
sun
position
that
held
and
shone
for
nigh
an
hour
and
only
faded
with
the
twilight
it
is
not
surprising
that
these
appearances
should
deeply
impress
the
untutored
mind
and
should
be
deemed
significant
and
portentous
they
must
deeply
impress
any
normal
mind
they
are
so
grand
and
so
strange
the
man
who
has
trained
his
intellect
until
it
is
so
stale
and
starved
his
imagination
until
it
is
so
shrivelled
that
he
can
gaze
unmoved
at
such
spectacles
that
they
are
insignificant
to
him
has
but
reduced
himself
to
the
level
of
the
dog
upon
whom
also
they
make
no
impression
though
even
a
dog
will
howl
at
a
great
aurora
of
course
we
know
all
about
them
any
schoolboy
can
pick
up
a
primer
of
physical
geography
and
explain
the
laws
of
refraction
and
the
ugly
and
most
libellous
diagram
of
circles
and
angles
that
shows
just
how
these
lustrous
splendours
happen
but
the
mystery
beyond
is
not
by
one
hair
breadth
impaired
nor
their
influence
upon
the

perhaps
more
than
any
other
country
it
is
the

that
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
that
shows
his
handiwork
and
the
awestruck
indian
who
comes
with
timid
inquiry
of
the
import
of
such
phenomena
is
rightfully
and
scientifically
answered
that
the
great
father
is
setting
a
sign
in
the
sky
that
he
still
rules
that
his
laws
and
commandments
shall
never
lose
their
force
whether
in
the
heavens
above
or
on
the
earth
beneath
sidenote
the
strong
cold
the
strong
cold
itself
is
an
thing
even
to
those
who
have
been
familiar
with
it
all
their
lives
and
a
dweller
in
other
climes
endowed
with
any
imagination
may
without
much
difficulty
enter
into
the
feelings
of
one
who
experiences
it
for
the
first
time
it
descends
upon
the
earth
in
the
brief
twilight
and
long
darkness
of
the
dead
of
winter
with
an
irresistible
power
and
an
inflexible
menace

still
and
despite
all

all
woollens
all

the
body
will
gradually
become
numb
and
death
stalk
upon
the
scene
the
strong
cold
brings
fear
with
it
all
devices
to
exclude
it
to
conserve
the
vital
heat
seem
feeble
and
futile
to
contend
with
its

it

to
hold
all

in

crushing
relentless
grasp
and
to
tighten
and
tighten
the
grip
as
the
temperature
falls
yet
the
very
power
of
it
and
the
dread
that
accompanies
it
give
a
certain
fearful
and
romantic
joy
to
the
conquest
of
it

fully
into

feels
an
exultation
that
manhood
is
stronger
even
than
the
strong
cold
but
he
is
a
fool
if
ever
he
grow
to
disdain
the
enemy
it
waits
inexorable
for
just
such
disdain
and
has
slain
many
at

who
had
long
and
often
withstood
it
on
those
rare
occasions
when
there
is
any
wind
any
movement
of
the
air
at
all
there
enters
another
and
a
different
feeling
into
the
menace
of
a
power
irresistible
inflexible
but
yet
insentient
there
seems
to
enter
a
purposeful
vengeful
evil
it
pursues
the
cold
itself
becomes
merely
a
condition
the
wind
a
deadly
weapon
which
uses
that
condition
to
deprive
its
victim
of
all
defence
the
warmth
which
active
exercise
stores
up
the
buckler
of
the
traveller
is
borne
away
his
reserves
are
invaded
depleted
destroyed
and
then
the
wind
falls
upon
him
with
its
sword
of
all
of
which
we
were
to
have
instance
here
on
the
koyukuk
sidenote
found
frozen
in
the
second
week
of
our
stay
at
bettles
while
divine
service
was
in
progress
in
the
store
building
crowded
with
whites
and
natives
the
door
opened
and
with
an
inrush
of
cold
air
that
condensed
the
moisture
at
that
end
of
the
room
into
a
cloud
and
shot
along
the
floor
like
steam
from
an
engine
exhaust
there
entered
an
indian
covered
with
rime
his
whole
one
mass
of
white
frost
his
just
removed
under
his
arm
and
a
beaded
wallet
over
his
shoulder
every
eye
was
at
once
turned
to
him
as
he
beat
the
frost
from
his
parkee
hood
and
thrust
it
back
unwrapped
fold
after
fold
of
the
scarf
from
his
face
and
pulled
off
his
mittens
seeking
out
the
agent
he
moved
over
to
him
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
it
was
plain
that
the
errand
was
of
moment
and
the
message
disturbing
and
as
i
had
lost
the
attention
of
the
congregation
and
the
continuity
of
my
own
discourse
i
drew
things
to
a
close
as
quickly
as
i
decently
could
that
indian
had
come
miles
on
in
one
run
without
stopping
at
all
save
to
eat
two
or
three
times
at
a
continuous
temperature
of
below
zero
or
lower
to
bring
word
that
he
had
found
a
white
man
frozen
to
death
on
the
trail
and
on
the
koyukuk
that
feat
will
always
be
counted
to
albert
the
pilot
for
righteousness
from
the
location
and
description
of
the
dead
man
there
was
no
difficulty
in
identifying
him
he
was
a
under
contract
with
the
company
to
cut
one
hundred
cords
of
steamboat
wood
against
next
navigation
at
a
spot
about
one
hundred
miles
below
bettles
he
had
taken
down
with
him
on
the
last
water
enough
grub
for
about
three
months
and
was
to
return
to
bettles
for
christmas
and
for
fresh
supplies
after
a
day
or
two
rest
the
indian
was
sent
back
with
instructions
to
bring
the
body
to
a
native
village
we
should
visit
to
whipsaw
lumber
for
a
coffin
and
dig
a
grave
and
we
engaged
to
give
the
body
christian
burial
uneasy
at
the
softening
muscles
and
sinews
of
this
long
inaction
i
took
and
a
couple
of
kobuks
one
day
and
made
an
ascent
of
the
hill
behind
bettles
known
as
lookout
mountain
because
from
its
top
the
smoke
of
the
eagerly
expected
first
steamboat
of
the
summer
may
be
seen
many
miles
down
the
river
being
moved
to
that
particular
excursion
by
dispute
among
the
freighters
as
to
the
hill
height
the
change
of
temperature
as
we
climbed
the
hill
was
striking
on
the
first
shoulder
we
were
already
out
of
the
dense
atmosphere
of
the
valley
and
above
the
smoke
gloom
of
the
houses
and
as
we
rose
the
air
grew
milder
and
milder
until
at
the
top
we
emerged
into
the
first
sunshine
of
many
weeks
and
were
in
an
altogether
different
climate
balmy
and
grateful
it
was
to
us
just
come
up
from
the
strong
cold
the
aneroid
showed
the
altitude
about
seven
hundred
feet
above
bettles
and
i
regretted
very
much
i
had
not
brought
the
thermometer
as
well
for
its
reading
would
have
been
most
interesting
the
view
from
the
top
was
brilliantly
clear
and
the
broad
plain
across
the
river
was
checkered
black
and
white
with
alternating
spruce
thickets
and
lakes
beyond
it
and
the
mountains
that
bounded
it
lay
the
valley
of
the
south
fork
which
we
had
crossed
fifty
or
sixty
miles
farther
up
on
our
journey
hither
right
in
front
of
us
the
middle
fork
made
its
big
bend
from
southwest
to
south
and
to
the
left
that
is
to
the
north
the
valley
of
the
john
river
opened
up
its
course
through
the
sharp
white
peaks
of
the
endicott
mountains
it
was
in
this
direction
that
my
eyes
lingered
longest
i
knew
that
sixty
or
seventy
miles
up
this
river
we
could
cross
the
low
anaktuvak
pass
into
the
anaktuvak
river
which
flows
into
the
colville
and
that
descending
the
colville
we
could
reach
the
shores
of
the
northern
ocean
it
was
a
journey
i
had
wished
to
make
and
have
wished
ever
since
there
are
many
bands
of
esquimaux
on
that
coast
never
visited
save
by
those
who
make
merchandise
of
them
in
one
way
or
another
please
god
some
day
i
should
get
there
meanwhile
our
present
hopes
lay
west
though
indeed
these
grew
daily
fainter

kobuk

kotzebue
sound
all
our
preparations
were
long
since
made
our
indian
guide
had
been
sent
back
to
fort
yukon
from
coldfoot
and
here
we
engaged
a
young
esquimau
with
his
dog
team
and
sled
to
go
across
to
kotzebue
sound
with
us
there
was
also
a
young
dane
who
wished
to
go
from
the
koyukuk
diggings
to
the
diggings
at
candle
creek
on
the
seward
peninsula
and
him
we
were
willing
to
feed
in
return
for
his
assistance
on
the
trail
the
supplies
had
been
carefully
calculated
for
the
journey
the
toboggans
were
already
loaded
and
we
waited
but
a
break
in
the
cold
weather
to
start
our
course
from
bettles
would
lead
us
miles
farther
down
the
koyukuk
to
the
mouth
of
the
alatna
the
visit
to
the
native
village
and
the
burial
of
the
poor
fellow
frozen
to
death
would
take
us
ten
miles
farther
down
than
that
and
we
would
return
to
the
alatna
mouth
then
the
way
would
lie
for
fifty
miles
or
so
up
that
stream
and
then
over
a
portage
across
to
the
kobuk
river
which
we
should
descend
to
its
mouth
in
kotzebue
sound
the
whole
distance
being
about
five
hundred
miles
through
a
very
little
travelled
country
we
learned
indeed
that
it
had
been
travelled
but
once
this
winter
and
that
on
the
first
snow
it
was
thought
at
bettles
that
we
might
possibly
procure
some
supplies
at
a
newly
established
mission
of
the
society
of
friends
about
down
the
kobuk
river
but
there
was
no
certainty
about
it
and
we
must
carry
with
us
enough
to
take
us
to
salt
water
our
supply
of
dog
fish
we
might
safely
count
upon
replenishing
from
the
natives
on
the
kobuk
another
thing
that
caused
some
thought
was
the
supply
of
small
money
there
was
no
silver
and
no
currency
except
large
bills
on
the
koyukuk
and
we
should
need
money
in
small
sums
to
buy
fish
with
so
the
agent
weighed
out
a
number
of
little
packets
of
carefully
sealed
up
in
stout
like
medicine
powders
some
worth
a
dollar
some
worth
two
dollars
the
value
written
on
the
face
and
we
found
them
readily
accepted
by
the
natives
and
very
convenient
two
years
later
i
heard
of
some
of
those
packets
unbroken
still
current
on
the
kobuk
at
last
on
the
of
january
we
got
away
the
thermometer
stood
only
a
few
degrees
above
when
we
left
but
the
barometer
had
been
falling
slowly
for
a
couple
of
days
and
i
was
convinced
the
cold
spell
was
over
with
our
three
teams
and
four
men
we
made
quite
a
little
expedition
but
dogs
and
men
were
alike
soft
and
for
the
first
two
days
the
travel
was
laborious
and
slow
then
came
milder
weather
and
better
going

to
the
koyukuk

reports

recent
discoveries
there
a
great
many
little
steamboat
outfits
made
their
way
up
this
river
late
in
the
season
until
their
excessive
draught
in
the
falling
water
brought
them
to
a
stand
where
they
stopped
they
wintered
building
cabins
and
starting
towns
in
one
or
two
cases
the
towns
were
electrically
lit
from
the

dynamo
the
next
summer
they
all
left
all
save
those
who
were
wrecked
by
the
ice
and
the
towns
were
abandoned

they
had
got
upon

some
enterprising
representative

nothing

though
at
bergman
the
commercial
company
had
a
plant
for
a
while
we
passed
the
mouth
of
the
alatna
where
were
two
or
three
indian
cabins
and
went
on
the
remaining
ten
miles
to
moses
village
where
the
body
of
the
man
frozen
to
death
had
been
brought
moses
village
named
from
the
chief
was
the
largest
native
village
on
the
koyukuk
river
and
we
were
glad
despite
our
haste
that
we
had
gone
there
the
repeated
requests
from
all
the
indians
we
met
for
a
mission
and
school
on
the
koyukuk
river
and
the
neglected
condition
of
the
people
had
moved
me
the
previous
year
to
take
up
the
matter
this
was
my
first
visit
however
so
far
down
the
river
we
found
the
coffin
unmade
and
the
grave
undug
and
set
men
vigorously
to
work
at
both
the
frozen
body
had
been
found
fallen
forward
on
hands
and
feet
and
since
to
straighten
it
would
be
impossible
without
several
days
thawing
in
a
cabin
the
coffin
had
to
be
of
the
size
and
shape
of
a
of
course
the
ground
for
the
grave
had
to
be
thawed
down
for
so
are
all
graves
dug
in
alaska
and
that
is
a
slow
business
a
fire
is
kindled
on
the
ground
and
when
it
has
burned
out
as
much
ground
as
it
has
thawed
is
dug
and
then
another
fire
is
kindled
we
had
our
own
gruesome
task
the
body
should
be
examined
to
make
legally
sure
that
death
came
from
natural
causes
with
difficulty
the
clothes
were
stripped
from
the
poor
marble
corpse
my
companion
made
the
examination
and
as
a
notary
public
i
swore
him
to
a
report
for
the
nearest
united
states
commissioner
this
would
furnish
legal
proof
of
death
were
it
ever
required
otherwise
since
there
is
no
provision
for
the
travelling
expenses
of
coroners
and
the
nearest
was
one
hundred
and
forty
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
there
would
have
been
no
inquest
and
no
such
proof
sidenote
a
wilderness
tragedy
the
man
had
delayed
his
return
to
bettles
too
long
when
his
food
was
exhausted
and
he
had
to
go
there
came
on
that
terrible
cold
spell
a
little
in
his
pocket
told
the
pitiful
story
day
by
day
he
lingered
hoping
for
a
change
and
day
by
day
there
was
entry
of
the
awful
cold
he
had
no
thermometer
but
he
knew
the
temperature
was
or
lower
by
the
cracking
noise
that
his
breath
made
the
test
at
last
the
grub
was
all
gone
and
he
must
go
or
starve
the
final
entry
read
all
aboard
hope
to
god
i
get
there
the
indians
estimated
that
he
had
been
walking
two
days
and
had
siwashed
it
at
night
somewhere
beside
a
fire
in
the
open
without
bedding
holes
were
burned
in
his
breeches
in
two
places
where
doubtless
he
had
got
too
near
the
fire
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
eat
with
him
save
a
piece
of
bacon
gnawed
to
the
rind
there
were
only
two
matches
in
his
pocket
and
they
were
mixed
up
with
trash
of
and
tobacco
so
it
is
likely
he
did
not
know
he
had
them
he
had
lit
all
the
fires
he
could
light
and
eaten
all
the
food
he
had
to
eat
still
he
was
plugging
along
towards
the
native
village
nine
miles
away
then
he
lost
the
trail
probably
in
the
dark
for
it
was
faint
and
much
drifted
and
had
taken
off
his
to
feel
with
his
moccasined
feet
for
the
hardened
snow
that
would
indicate
it
that
was
almost
the
end
he
had
gone
across
the
river
and
back
again
feeling
for
the
trail
and
then
with
the
deadly
numbness
already
upon
his
brain
had
wandered
in
a
circle
the
date
of
his
starting
in
the
and
the
distance
travelled
made
it
almost
certain
that
at
some
moment
between
the
time
when
those
three
moons
floated
in
the
sky
and
the
time
when
that
cross
glared
on
the
horizon
he
had
fallen
in
the
snow
never
to
rise
again
below
zero
and
a
wind
blowing
one
supposes
that
the
actual
death
by
freezing
is
painless
as
it
is
certainly
slow
and
gradual
the
only
instance
of
sudden
gelation
i
ever
heard
of
is
in
longfellow
wreck
of
the
hesperus
where
the
skipper
having
answered
one
question
upon
being
asked
another
answered
never
a
word
for
a
frozen
corpse
was
he
but
if
the
actual
death
be
painless
the
long
conscious
fight
against
it
must
be
an
agony
for
a
man
of
any
experience
must
realise
the
peril
he
is
in
the
tingling
in
fingers
and
toes
and
then
in
knees
and
elbows
is
a
warning
he
recognises
only
too
well
he
knows
that
unless
he
can
restore
warmth
by
restoring
the
circulation
he
is
as
good
as
frozen
already
he
increases
his
pace
and
beats
his
arms
against
his
breast
but
if
his
vitality
be
too
much
reduced
by
hunger
and
fatigue
and
cold
to
make
more
than
a
slight
response
to
the
stimulation
if
the
distance
to
warmth
and
shelter
be
too
great
for
a
spurt
to
carry
him
there
he
is
soon
in
worse
case
than
before
then
the
appalling
prospect
of
perishing
by
the
cold
must
rise
nakedly
before
him
the
enemy
is
in
the
breach
swarming
over
the
ramparts
advancing
to
the
heart
of
the
fortress
not
to
be
again
repelled
he
becomes
aware
that
his
hands
and
feet
are
already
frozen
and
presently
there
may
be
a
momentary
terrible
recognition
that
his
wits
begin
to
wander
frantically
he
stumbles
on
thrashing
his
body
with
his
arms
forcing
his
gait
to
the
uttermost
a
prey
to
the
terror
that
hangs
over
him
until
his
growing
horror
and
despair
are
mercifully
swallowed
up
in
the
somnolent
torpidity
that
overwhelms
him
all
of
us
who
have
travelled
in
cold
weather
know
how
uneasy
and
apprehensive
a
man
becomes
when
the
fingers
grow
obstinately
cold
and
he
realises
that
he
is
not
succeeding
in
getting
them
warm
again
it
is
the
beginning
of
death
by
freezing
we
buried
the
body
on
a
bench
of
the
bluff
across
the
river
from
the
native
village
the
natives
all
standing
around
reverently
while
the
words
of
committal
were
said
and
set
up
a
cross
marked
with
eric
ericson
found
frozen
january
two
or
three
years
later
a
friend
sent
me
a
small
bronze
tablet
with
the
same
legend
and
that
was
affixed
to
the
cross
there
are
many
such
lonely
graves
in
alaska
for
scarce
a
winter
passes
that
does
not
claim
its
victims
in
every
section
of
the
country
that
same
winter
we
heard
of
two
men
frozen
on
the
seward
peninsula
two
on
the
yukon
one
on
the
tanana
and
one
on
the
valdez
trail
this
day
i
recorded
a
temperature
of
the
first
plus
temperature
in
days
and
that
previous
rise
above
zero
was
the
first
in
twenty
days
sidenote
neglected
natives
that
night
we
gathered
all
the
natives
and
after
long
speech
with
poor
interpretation
i
ventured
to
promise
them
a
mission
the
next
year
some
of
them
had
been
across
to
the
yukon
years
before
and
had
visited
the
mission
at
tanana
some
had
been
baptized
there
some
had
never
seen
a
clergyman
or
missionary
of
any
sort
before
and
had
never
heard
the
gospel
preached
we
were
touched
by
one
old
blind
woman
who
told
of
a
visit
to
a
mission
on
the
yukon
and
how
she
learned
to
sing
a
hymn
there
her
son
interpreted
she
say
every
night
she
sing
that
hymn
for
speak
to
god
she
was
encouraged
to
sing
it
and
it
turned
out
to
be
the
alphabet
set
to
a
tune
after
much
pleading
and
with
some
hesitation
i
baptized
seventeen
children
comforting
myself
with
the
assurance
of
the
coming
mission
which
would
undertake
their
christian
training
and
instruction
back
next
day
at
the
mouth
of
the
alatna
i
was
again
impressed
with
the
eligibility
of
that
spot
as
a
mission
site
it
was
but
ten
miles
above
the
present
native
village
and
with
church
and
school
established
the
whole
population
would
sooner
or
later
move
to
it
this
gives
opportunity
for
regulating
the
building
of
cabins
and
the
advantage
of
a
new
clean
start
moreover
the
alatna
river
is
the
highway
between
the
kobuk
and
the
koyukuk
and
the
esquimaux
coming
over
in
increasing
numbers
would
be
served
by
a
mission
at
this
place
as
well
as
the
indians
i
foresaw
two
villages
perhaps
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
river
one
clustered
about
the
church
and
the
school
the
other
a
little
lower
down
where
these
ancient
hereditary
enemies
might
live
side
by
side
in
peace
and
harmony
under
the
firm
yet
gentle
influence
of
the
church
so
i
staked
a
mission
site
and
set
up
notices
claiming
ground
for
that
purpose
almost
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
alatna
which
in
the
native
tongue
is
allakaket
or
allachaket
sidenote
the
inland
esquimaux
there
was
some
trail
up
the
alatna
and
we
made
fair
headway
on
its
surface
stopping
two
nights
at
kobuk
huts
we
are
out
of
the
indian
country
now
and
shall
see
no
more
indians
until
we
are
back
on
the
yukon
the
mode
of
life
the
habits
the
character
of
the
races
are
very
different
the
first
esquimau
habitation
we
visited
proclaiming
it
these
inland
esquimaux
though
some
of
the
younger
ones
have
never
seen
salt
water
our
guide
roxy
for
one
are
still
essentially
a
people
their
huts
even
in
the
midst
of
trees
are
affairs
for
they
have
not
learned
the
windows
are
of
seal
gut
and
seal
oil
is
a
staple
article
of
their
diet
their
clothing
is
also
marine
their
parkees
of
the
and
their
mukluks
of
the
giant
seal
communications
are
always
kept
up
with
the
coast
and
the
sea
products
required
are
brought
across
the
time
for
the
movement
of
the
kobuks
back
and
forth
was
not
quite
yet
though
we
hoped
we
should
meet
some
parties
and
get
the
benefit
of
their
trail
just
before
we
left
the
alatna
river
we
stopped
at
roxy
fish
cache
and
got
some
green
fish
hewing
them
out
of
the
frozen
mass
with
the
axe
the
young
man
had
fished
here
the
previous
summer
had
cached
the
fish
caught
too
late
to
dry
in
the
sun
and
they
had
remained
where
he
left
them
for
four
or
five
months
most
of
them
had
begun
to
decay
before
they
froze
but
that
did
not
impair
their
value
as
dog
food
though
it
rendered
the
cooking
of
them
a
disagreeable
proceeding
to
white
nostrils
this
caching
of
food
is
a
common
thing
amongst
both
natives
and
whites
and
it
is
rarely
that
a
cache
is
violated
except
under
great
stress
of
hunger
when
violation
is
recognised
as
legitimate
doughty
in
his
mentions
the
same
custom
amongst
the
arabs
sven
hedin
amongst
the
tartars
sparsely
peopled
waste
countries
have
much
the
same
customs
all
over
the
world
even
the
outer
garb
in
the
oriental
deserts
has
much
resemblance
to
our
parkee
both
burnoose
and
parkee
are
primarily
windbreaks
and
it
makes
little
difference
whether
the
wind
be
charged
with
snow
or
sand
at
midday
on
the
of
february
we
left
the
alatna
river
and
took
our
way
across
country
for
the
kobuk
we
had
now
no
trail
at
all
save
what
had
been
made
a
couple
of
months
before
by
the
only
other
party
that
had
crossed
the
portage
this
winter
and
it
was
buried
under
fifteen
or
sixteen
inches
of
snow
there
was
quite
a
grade
to
be
climbed
to
reach
the
plateau
over
which
our
course
lay
and
the
men
with
rope
over
the
shoulder
had
to
help
the
dogs
hauling
at
the
sled
indeed
over
a
good
deal
of
this
portage
from
time
to
time
the
men
had
to
do
dog
work
for
the
country
is
rolling
one
ridge
succeeding
another
and
the
loose
deep
snow
made
heavy
and
slow
going
one
man
must
go
ahead
breaking
trail
and
that
was
generally
my
task
though
when
the
route
grew
doubtful
and
the
indications
too
faint
for
white
man
eye
roxy
took
my
place
and
i
took
his
gee
pole
and
slipped
his
rope
around
my
chest
breaking
trail
would
not
be
so
laborious
if
one
could
wear
the
large
that
are
used
for
hunting
but
the
hunting
shoe
though
it
carries
the
man
without
fatigue
does
not
help
the
dogs
the
small
shoe
known
as
the
trail
shoe
packs
the
snow
beneath
it
and
by
the
time
the
trail
breaker
has
gone
forward
then
back
again
and
then
forward
once
more
the
snow
is
usually
packed
hard
enough
to
give
the
dogs
some
footing
footing
the
dog
must
have
or
he
can
not
pull
a
dog
wallowing
in
snow
to
his
belly
can
not
exert
much
traction
on
the
vehicle
behind
him
the
notion
of
as
a
sport
always
seems
strange
to
us
on
the
trail
for
to
us
it
is
a
laborious
necessity
and
no
sport
at
all
the
trail
breaker
thus
goes
over
most
of
the
ground
thrice
and
when
he
is
anxious
at
the
same
time
to
get
a
fairly
accurate
estimate
by
the
pedometer
of
the
distance
travelled
he
must
constantly
remember
to
upend
the
instrument
in
his
pocket
when
he
retraces
his
steps
and
restore
it
to
its
recording
position
when
he
attacks
unbroken
snow
again
also
he
must
take
himself
unawares
so
to
speak
from
time
to
time
and
check
the
length
of
his
stride
with
the
tape
measure
and
alter
the
step
index
as
the
varying
surfaces
passed
over
require
conscientiously
used
with
due
regard
to
its
limitations
the
pedometer
will
give
a
fair
approximation
of
the
length
of
a
journey
but
a
man
can
no
more
tell
how
far
he
has
gone
by
merely
hanging
a
pedometer
in
his
pocket
than
he
can
tell
the
height
above
of
an
inland
mountain
by
merely
carrying
an
aneroid
barometer
to
the
top
sidenote
the
sunrise
and
the
mountains
it
was
on
this
portage
that
we
saw
the
most
magnificent
sunrise
any
of
us
could
remember
it
had
been
cloudy
for
some
days
with
threat
of
snow
which
did
not
fall
we
were
camped
in
a
little
hollow
between
two
ridges
and
i
had
been
busy
packing
up
the
stuff
in
the
tent
preparatory
to
the
start
when
i
stepped
out
with
a
load
of
bedding
in
my
arms
right
into
the
midst
of
the
spectacle
it
was
simple
as
the
greatest
things
are
always
simple
but
so
gorgeous
and
splendid
that
it
was
startling
the
whole
southeastern
sky
was
filled
with
great
luminous
bands
of
alternate
purple
and
crimson
at
the
horizon
the
bands
were
deeper
in
tone
and
as
they
rose
they
grew
lighter
but
they
maintained
an
unmixed
purity
of
contrasting
colour
throughout
i
gazed
at
it
until
the
tent
was
struck
and
the
dogs
hitched
and
it
was
time
to
start
and
then
i
had
to
turn
my
back
upon
it
for
our
course
lay
due
west
and
i
was
breaking
trail
but
on
the
crest
of
the
rising
ground
ahead
there
burst
upon
my
delighted
eyes
a
still
more
astonishing
prospect
we
were
come
to
the
first
near
view
of
the
kobuk
mountains
and
the
reflected
light
of
that
gorgeous
sunrise
was
caught
by
the
flanks
of
a
group
of
wild
and
lofty
snow
peaks
and
they
stood
up
incandescent
with
a
vivid
colour
that
seemed
to
come
through
them
as
well
as
from
them
to
right
and
left
mountains
out
of
the
direct
path
of
that
light
gave
a
soft
dead
mauve
but
these
favoured
peaks
bathed
from
base
to
summit
in
clear
crimson
effulgence
glowed
like
molten
metal
it
was
not
the
reflected
light
of
the
sun
but
of
the
flaming
sky
for
even
as
i
looked
a
swift
change
came
over
them
they
passed
through
the
tones
of
red
to
lightest
pink
not
fading
but
brightening
and
before
my
companions
reached
me
the
sun
rays
sprang
upon
the
mountains
from
the
horizon
and
they
were
golden
it
seems
almost
foolish
to
the
writer
and
may
well
seem
tedious
to
the
reader
to
attempt
in
words
the
description
of
such
scenes
yet
so
deep
is
the
impression
they
produce
and
so
large
the
place
they
take
in
the
memory
that
to
omit
them
would
be
to
strike
out
much
of
the
charm
and
zest
of
these
arctic
journeys
again
and
again
in
the
years
that
have
passed
the
recollection
of
that
pomp
of
colour
on
the
way
to
the
kobuk
has
come
suddenly
upon
me
and
always
with
a
bounding
of
the
spirit
i
can
shut
my
eyes
now
and
see
that
incomparable
sunrise
i
can
see
again
that
vision
of
mountains
filling
half
the
sky
with
their
unimaginable
ardency
and
i
think
that
this
world
never
presented
nobler
sight
surely
for
its
pageantry
of
burning
living
colour
for
purity
and
depth
and
intensity
of
tint
the
far
north
with
its
setting
of
snow
surpasses
all
other
regions
of
the
earth
sidenote
travelling
kobuk
lads
that
same
day
we
met
a
couple
of
kobuk
youths
on
their
way
to
the
koyukuk
and
they
gave
us
the
greatest
gift
it
was
in
the
power
of
man
to
give
us
a
trail
there
is
no
finer
illustration
of
the
mutual
service
of
man
to
man
than
the
meeting
of
parties
going
opposite
ways
across
the
unbroken
snows
each
is
at
once
conferring
and
receiving
the
greatest
of
favours
without
loss
to
himself
is
heaping
benefit
on
the
other
is
it
may
be
has
often
been
saving
the
other
and
being
himself
saved
no
more
hunting
and
peering
for
blazes
no
more
casting
about
hither
and
thither
when
open
stretches
are
crossed
no
more
three
times
back
and
forth
to
beat
the
snow
down
twenty
miles
a
day
instead
of
ten
or
twelve
the
boys
trail
meant
all
that
to
us
and
our
trail
meant
almost
as
much
to
them
so
we
were
rejoiced
to
see
them
sturdy
youths
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
making
the
journey
all
by
themselves
my
heart
goes
out
to
these
adventurous
kobuks
amiable
industrious
keen
hunters
following
the
far
up
where
the
indian
will
not
go
adepts
in
all
the
wilderness
arts
heirs
of
the
uncharted
arctic
wastes
and
occupying
their
heritage
if
i
were
not
a
white
man
i
would
far
rather
be
one
of
these
nomadic
inland
esquimaux
than
any
other
native
i
know
of
that
same
day
we
crossed
two
headwater
forks
of
the
kokochatna
as
the
kobuks
call
it
or
the
hogatzitna
as
the
koyukuks
call
it
or
the
hog
river
as
the
white
men
call
it
a
tributary
of
the
koyukuk
that
comes
in
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
below
the
alatna
as
we
came
down
a
steep
descent
to
the
little
east
fork
it
showed
so
picturesque
and
attractive
with
clumps
of
fine
open
timber
on
an
island
that
it
remains
in
my
mind
one
of
the
many
places
from
the
grand
cañon
of
the
colorado
almost
to
the
grand
cañon
of
the
noatak
where
i
should
like
to
have
a
lodge
in
the
vast
wilderness
we
had
but
crossed
the
west
fork
when
we
knew
that
we
were
close
to
the
watershed
between
the
kobuk
and
the
koyukuk
between
the
streams
that
fall
into
kotzebue
sound
and
those
that
fall
by
the
koyukuk
and
the
yukon
rivers
into
bering
sea
and
because
it
seemed
a
capital
geographic
feature
it
was
disappointing
that
it
was
so
inconspicuous
indeed
we
were
not
sure
which
of
two
ridges
was
the
actual
divide
beyond
those
ridges
there
was
no
question
for
the
ground
sloped
down
to
lake
noyutak
a
body
of
water
some
three
and
a
half
miles
in
length
and
of
varying
breadth
that
drains
into
the
kobuk
here
in
a
cabin
we
found
three
more
young
kobuks
and
spent
the
night
getting
our
first
view
of
the
kobuk
river
next
day
not
from
an
eminence
as
i
had
hoped
but
only
as
we
came
down
a
bank
through
thick
timber
and
opened
suddenly
upon
it
by
the
pedometer
i
made
the
portage
miles
sidenote
the
kobuk
river
the
upper
kobuk
is
a
picturesque
river
the
timber
being
especially
large
and
handsome
for
interior
alaska
we
reached
it
just
above
the
mouth
of
the
reed
river
tributary
from
the
north
the
weather
was
warm
too
warm
for
good
travelling
the
thermometer
standing
at
and
one
day
even
above
zero
all
day
long
so
that
we
were
all
bareheaded
and
in
our
from
time
to
time
as
the
course
of
the
river
varied
we
had
distant
views
of
the
rocky
mountains
of
the
endicott
range
or
as
it
might
be

the
division

four
gave
us
all
some
leisure
at

i

to

with
much
pleasure
quite
agreeing
with
sir

judgment
that
the

is
one
of
the
best
historical

ever

this
matter
of
winter
reading
is
a
difficult
one
because
it
is
impossible
to
carry
many
books
my
plan
is
to
take
two
or
three
volumes
of
classics
that
have
been
read
before
and
renew
my
acquaintance
with
them
but
reading
by
the
light
of
one
candle
though
it
sufficed
our
forefathers
is
hard
on
our
degenerate
eyes
the
days
were
much
lengthened
now
and
the
worst
of
the
winter
was
done
there
would
still
be
cold
and
storm
but
hardly
again
of
the
same
intensity
and
duration
when
the
traveller
gets
well
into
february
he
feels
that
the
back
of
the
winter
is
broken
for
nothing
can
take
from
him
the
advantage
of
the
days
the
sun
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
on
the
kobuk
we
reached
a
cabin
occupied
by
two
white
men
the
first
we
had
seen
since
we
left
bettles
and
we
were
the
first
white
men
they
had
seen
all
the
winter
they
were
waiting
for
the
spring
having
a
prospecting
trip
in
view
simply
spending
the
winter
eating
up
their
grub
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
read
in
the
cabin
and
they
had
been
there
since
the
they
welcomed
us
and
we
stayed
overnight
with
them
and
that
night
there
was
a
total
eclipse
of
the
moon
of
which
we
had
a
fine
view
we
had
an
almanac
which
gave
the
time
of
totality
at
sitka
and
we
knew
the
approximate
longitude
of
our
position
so
we
were
able
to
set
our
watches
by
it
the
next
two
days
are
noted
in
my
diary
as
two
of
the
pleasantest
days
of
the
whole
journey
two
of
the
pleasantest
days
i
ever
spent
anywhere
i
think
a
clear
cloudless
sky
brilliant
sunshine
white
mountain
peaks
all
about
us
gave
picture
after
picture
and
the
warm
balmy
air
made
travelling
a
delight
there
are
few
greater
pleasures
than
that
of
penetrating
into
a
new
country
with
continually
changing
views
of
beauty
under
kindly
conditions
of
weather
and
trail
in
the
yellow
rays
of
the
early
sun
the
spruce
on
the
river
bank
looked
like
a
screen
of
carved
bronze
while
the
slender
stems
of
birches
in
front
of
the
spruce
looked
like
an
inlaying
of
old
ivory
upon
the
bronze
the
whole
set
upon
its
pedestal
of
snow
the
second
day
we
took
a
portage
of
nine
or
ten
miles
across
a
barren
flat
and
struck
the
river
again
just
below
a
remarkable
stretch
of
bank
a
mile
or
so
in
length
with
never
a
tree
or
a
bush
or
so
much
as
the
smallest
shrub
growing
on
it
thick
timber
above
suddenly
ceased
thick
timber
below
suddenly
began
again
and
this
bare
bank
reached
back
through
open
barren
flat
to
a
low
pass
in
the
mountains
it
was
a
bank
of
solid
ice
so
we
were
told
later
and
i
remembered
to
have
heard
of
ice
bluffs
on
the
kobuk
and
wished
that
the
portage
had
struck
the
river
above
this
spot
instead
of
below
it
that
there
might
have
been
opportunity
to
examine
it
sidenote
the
mission
sidenote
english
and
esquimau
a
little
farther
down
the
river
and
we
were
at
the
new
mission
of
the
society
of
friends
where
a
cordial
reception
awaited
us
and
luxury
of
luxuries
a
warm
bath
again
and
again
the
was
emptied
and
fresh
water
was
heated
until
we
all
had
wallowed
to
our
heart
content
the
rude
log
buildings
of
the
mission
had
been
begun
the
previous
fall
and
were
not
yet
complete
but
they
were
advanced
enough
for
occupation
and
the
work
of
the
mission
went
actively
on
it
was
in
charge
of
rather
an
extraordinary
man
he
gave
us
a
sketch
of
his
life
which
was
full
of
interest
and
matter
for
thought
for
many
years
he
was
a
police
officer
and
jailer
in
the
west
then
he
sailed
on
a
whaler
and
thus
became
acquainted
with
the
esquimaux
he
was
converted
from
a
life
of
drunkenness
and
debauchery
though
one
fancied
his
character
was
not
really
ever
so
bad
as
he
painted
it
at
a
peniel
mission
in
a
californian
town
he
went
in
out
of
mere
idle
curiosity
just
recovered
from
a
spree
and
was
so
wrought
upon
that
when
he
came
out
he
was
a
different
creature
a
new
man
the
old
life
with
its
appetite
for
vicious
indulgence
sloughed
off
and
left
behind
him
and
he
now
possessed
with
a
burning
desire
to
do
some
such
active
service
for
god
as
aforetime
he
had
done
for
the
devil
after
three
or
four
months
of
some
sort
of
training
in
an
institution
maintained
by
the
california
society
of
friends
a
body
more
like
the
salvation
army
one
judges
than
the
old
quakers
he
volunteered
for
service
at
a
branch
which
the
mission
of
the
society
at
the
mouth
of
the
kobuk
desired
to
plant
two
hundred
miles
or
so
up
the
river
and
had
come
out
and
had
plunged
at
once
into
his
task
so
here
he
was
some
six
or
seven
months
installed
teacher
preacher
trader
in
a
small
way
and
indefatigable
worker
in
general
pedagogical
training
or
knowledge
of
methods
he
had
none
at
all
but
the
root
of
the
matter
was
in
him
and
surely
never
was
such
an
insatiable
morning
noon
and
night
he
was
teaching
while
he
was
cooking
he
was
hearing
lessons
while
he
was
washing
the
dishes
and
cleaning
the
house
he
was
correcting
exercises
in
simple
addition
in
the
schoolroom
he
was
full
of
a
genial
enthusiasm
that
seemed
to
impart
instruction
by
sheer
dynamic
force
boot
the
lesson
book
said
there
was
no
boot
in
the
schoolroom
all
were
shod
in
mukluks
he
dives
into
his
attachment
and
comes
back
holding
up
a
boot
boot
he
says
and
boot
they
all
repeat
presently
the
word
tooth
was
introduced
in
the
lesson
withdrawing
a
loose
artificial
tooth
of
the
pivot
variety
from
his
upper
jaw
he
holds
it
aloft
and
tooth
he
cries
out
and
toot
they
all
cry
and
he
claps
it
back
into
his
head
again
we
were
present
on
sunday
at
the
services
there
was
hearty
singing
of
pentecostal
hymns
with
catchy
refrains
but
we
were
compelled
to
notice
again
what
we
had
noticed
amongst
the
little
bands
of
these
people
on
the
koyukuk
when
we
set
them
to
singing
that
the
english
was
unintelligible
and
since
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
us
could
have
had
little
for
them
this
is
the
inevitable
result
of
ignoring
the
native
tongue
and
adopting
the
easy
expedient
of
teaching
the
singing
of
hymns
and
the
recitation
of
formulas
like
the
commandments
in
english
for
a
generation
or
two
at
least
the
english
learned
save
by
children
at
a
where
nothing
but
english
is
spoken
is
fragmentary
and
of
doubtful
import
in
all
except
the
commonest
matters
of
speech
and
at
such
there
is
danger
of
the
real
misfortune
and
drawback
of
natives
growing
up
to
live
their
lives
amongst
natives
ignorant
of
the
native
tongue
there
is
no
quick
and
easy
way
of
stamping
out
a
language
thank
god
there
is
no
quick
and
easy
way
of
imparting
instruction
in
a
foreign
language
by
and
by
all
the
alaskan
natives
will
be
more
or
less
bilingual
but
the
intimate
speech
and
the
most
clearly
understood
speech
will
still
be
the
mother
tongue
the
singing
done
there
was
preaching
through
an
interpreter
and
then
each
individual
present
gave
testimony
which
consisted
for
the
most
part
in
the
recitation
of
a
text
of
scripture
then
there
were
individual
prayers
by
one
and
another
of
the
congregation
and
then
some
more
singing
the
only
hymn
i
could
find
in
the
book
that
i
knew
was
the
fine
old
hymn
how
firm
a
foundation
and
that
was
sung
heartily
to
the
adeste
fideles
they
are
naturally
a
musical
race
picking
up
airs
with
great
facility
and
they
thoroughly
enjoy
singing
sidenote
the
double
standard
after
the
service
the
missionary
confided
some
of
his
troubles
to
me
he
had
lately
learned
through
his
interpreter
that
the
burden
of
most
of
the
individual
prayers
was
that
the
supplicator
might
catch
plenty
skins
and
be
more
successful
in
hunting
than
his
fellows
and
though
he
had
done
his
best
to
impress
upon
them
the
superior
importance
of
making
request
for
spiritual
benefit
he
was
afraid
they
had
made
no
change
our
people
he
said
do
understand
these
folk
and
not
sure
that
i
thoroughly
understand
them
myself
they
all
he
said
they
all
claim
to
have
experienced
a
change
of
heart
but
some
of
them
i
know
are
not
living
like
converted
people
and
sometimes
i
have
my
doubts
about
most
of
them
my
sympathy
went
out
to
him
in
his
loneliness
and
his
earnestness
and
his
disappointments
i
pointed
out
that
the
emotional
response
to
emotional
preaching
was
comparatively
easy
to
get
from
any
primitive
people
but
that
to
change
their
whole
lives
to
uproot
old
customs
of
sensual
indulgence
to
engraft
new
ideas
of
virtue
and
chastity
was
a
long
slow
process
anywhere
in
the
world
it
was
chiefly
in
the
matter
of
sexual
morality
that
his
doubts
and
difficulties
lay
and
i
was
able
to
assure
him
that
his
experience
was
but
the
common
experience
of
all
those
who
had
laboured
for
the
uplifting
of
savage
people
indeed
how
should
it
be
otherwise
until
quite
lately
there
was
almost
promiscuous
use
of
women
a
man
receiving
a
traveller
in
his
dwelling
overnight
proffered
his
wife
as
a
part
of
his
hospitality
the
temporary
interchange
of
wives
was
common
young
men
and
young
women
gratified
themselves
without
rebuke
children
were
valuable
however
come
by
and
there
was
no
special
distinction
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
offspring
as
one
reflects
on
these
conditions
and
then
looks
back
upon
conditions
amongst
white
people
it
would
seem
that
all
the
civilised
races
have
done
is
to
set
up
a
double
standard
of
sexual
morality
as
against
the
single
standard
of
the
savage
it
can
hardly
be
claimed
that
the
average
white
man
is
continent
or
even
much
more
continent
than
the
average
esquimau
but
he
has
forced
continence
upon
the
greater
part
of
his
women
reserving
a
dishonoured
remnant
for
his
own
irresponsible
use
and
there
are
signs
that
some
of
those
who
nowadays
inveigh
against
the
white
man
double
standard
are
in
reality
desirous
of
substituting
not
the
single
standard
of
the
christian
ideal
but
the
single
standard
of
the
savage
in
the
mining
camps
the
prostitute
has
a
sort
of
social
position
and
in
polite
parlance
is
referred
to
as
a
sporting
lady
surely
the
most
horribly
incongruous
phrase
ever
coined
she
often
marries
a
miner
who
will
tell
you
that
she
is
as
good
as
he
is
and
she
is
received
afterwards
by
all
but
a
few
as
a
respectable
married
woman
there
had
been
some
trouble
of
this
sort
at
this
mission
the
great
northern
gold
seekers
wave
of
and
threw
a
numerous
band
of
prospectors
up
the
kobuk
as
well
as
up
the
koyukuk
the
wave
had
receded
and
left
on
the
kobuk
but
one
little
pool
behind
it
a
handful
of
men
who
found
something
better
than
pay
on
the
shungnak
a
few
miles
away
and
there
was
much
criticism
of
the
missionary
methods
amongst
them
word
of
the
arrival
of
strangers
had
brought
some
of
them
to
long
beach
and
on
sunday
night
i
had
opportunity
of
addressing
them
with
a
view
to
enlisting
their
sympathy
if
possible
what
if
mistakes
were
made
what
if
some
of
the
methods
employed
were
open
to
question
here
was
a
man
who
beyond
doubt
was
earnestly
labouring
in
the
best
way
he
knew
for
the
improvement
of
these
natives
such
an
effort
demanded
the
of
every
man
sidenote
personal
cleanliness
after
all
however
grand
the
physical
scenery
the
meteorological
phenomena
may
be
the
people
of
any
country
are
the
most
interesting
thing
in
it
and
we
found
these
esquimaux
extraordinarily
interesting
dirty
they
certainly
are
it
is
almost
impossible
for
dwellers
in
the
arctic
regions
to
be
clean
in
the
winter
and
the
winter
lasts
so
long
that
the
habit
of
winter
becomes
the
habit
of
the
year
white
and
native
alike
accept
a
lower
standard
of
personal
cleanliness
than
is
tolerated
outside
i
remember
asking
bishop
rowe
before
i
came
to
alaska
what
do
you
do
about
bathing
when
you
travel
in
the
winter
to
which
he
replied
laconically
do
without
it
is
even
so
travellers
on
the
alaskan
trails
as
well
as
natives
belong
to
the
great
unwashed
in
the
very
cold
weather
the
procuring
of
water
in
any
quantity
is
a
very
difficult
thing
even
for
house
dwellers
every
drop
of
it
has
to
be
carried
from
a
cut
far
out
on
the
ice
up
a
steep
grade
and
then
quite
a
little
distance
back
to
the
dwelling
for
we
do
not
build
directly
upon
these
eroding
banks
the
is
continually
freezing
up
and
has
to
be
continually
hewed
free
of
ice
and
as
the
streams
dwindle
with
the
progress
of
winter
new
holes
must
be
cut
farther
and
farther
out
on
the
trail
where
snow
must
usually
be
melted
for
water
it
is
obvious
that
bathing
is
out
of
the
question
even
the
water
for
hands
and
face
is
sparingly
doled
by
the
cook
and
two
people
will
sometimes
use
the
same
water
rather
than
resort
to
the
painful
though
efficient
expedient
of
washing
with
snow
if
this
be
so
despite
aluminum
pots
and
a
full
kit
of
camp
vessels
it
is
much
more
so
with
the
native
whose
supply
of
pots
and
pans
is
very
limited
i
have
seen
a
white
man
melt
snow
in
a
wash
hands
and
face
in
it
throw
it
out
fry
bacon
and
beans
in
it
then
melt
more
snow
and
wash
his
cup
and
plate
in
it
there
is
however
this
to
be
said
anent
the
disuse
of
the
bath
in
this
country
that
in
cold
weather
most
men
perspire
very
little
indeed
and
the
perspiration
that
is
exuded
passes
through
to
the
outer
garments
and
is
immediately
deposited
upon
them
as
frost
and
there
is
this
further
to
be
said
about
dirt
in
general
that
one
blessed
property
of
the
cold
is
to
kill
all
odours
one
grows
tolerant
of
dirt
in
this
country
there
is
no
denying
it
and
it
is
well
that
it
is
so
otherwise
one
would
be
in
a
chronic
state
of
disgust
with
oneself
and
every
one
else
so
the
dirt
of
the
native
unless
specially
prominent
and
offensive
is
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
and
ignored
this
obstacle
overcome
the
esquimaux
are
an
attractive
and
most
interesting
race
and
compare
to
advantage
with
the
indians
in
almost
every
particular
they
are
a
very
industrious
people
go
into
an
esquimau
hut
at
almost
any
time
when
they
are
not
sleeping
and
you
will
find
every
individual
occupied
at
some
task
here
is
a
man
working
in
wood
or
bone
with
the
ingenious
tools
they
have
evolved
here
are
women
working
in
skin
or
fur
and
some
of
them
are
admirable
needlewomen
here
perhaps
is
another
woman
chewing
mukluks
and
many
a
white
man
who
has
kept
his
feet
dry
in
overflow
water
is
grateful
to
the
teeth
that
do
not
disdain
this
most
effective
way
of
securing
an
intimate
union
between
sole
and
upper
even
the
children
are
busy
here
is
a
boy
whittling
out
bow
and
arrow
and
they
do
great
execution
amongst
rabbits
and
ptarmigan
with
these
weapons
that
entail
no
cost
of
powder
and
shot
here
is
a
girl
beating
out
threads
from
sinew
with
a
couple
of
flat
stones
some
of
us
troubled
with
unconscientious
tailors
wish
that
a
law
could
be
passed
requiring
all
buttons
to
be
sewn
on
with
sinew
they
never
come
off
sidenote
a
folk
they
are
a
very
people
easily
amused
bubbling
over
with
laughter
and
merriment
romping
and
skylarking
with
one
another
at
every
intermission
of
labour
one
of
my
white
travelling
companions
on
this
journey
was
in
the
habit
of
using
a
little
piece
of
rabbit
skin
to
protect
his
nose
in
cold
or
windy
weather
the
care
of
the
nose
is
sometimes
very
troublesome
indeed
it
freezes
more
readily
than
any
other
portion
of
the
body
and
a
little
piece
of
rabbit
skin
moistened
and
applied
to
the
nose
will
stay
there
and
keep
it
warm
and
comfortable
all
day
but
it
does
not
exactly
enhance
one
personal
attractions
we
had
stopped
for
camp
and
were
all
together
for
the
first
time
in
four
or
five
hours
when
roxy
noticed
this
nose
protector
upon
which
the
breath
had
condensed
all
the
afternoon
until
two
long
icicles
depended
from
it
one
on
each
side
reaching
down
below
the
mouth
and
he
fell
straightway
into
a
fit
of
laughter
that
grew
uncontrollable
he
rolled
on
the
snow
and
roared
a
little
annoyed
at
this
exhibition
i
spoke
sharply
what
the
matter
with
you
roxy
what
on
earth
are
you
cutting
up
like
that
for
checking
himself
for
a
moment
he
pointed
to
my
companion
and
said
alleesame
and
went
off
into
another
paroxysm
of
laughter
rolling
about
and
roaring
at
intervals
all
the
evening
he
would
break
out
again
and
when
we
sat
down
to
eat
it
overcame
him
once
more
and
he
rushed
outside
where
he
could
give
vent
to
his
mirth
with
less
offence
the
boy
was
straightforward
and
conscientious
we
were
camped
over
sunday
once
and
roxy
had
noticed
many
marten
tracks
in
the
neighbourhood
he
had
brought
a
few
traps
along
with
him
to
set
out
as
we
went
and
pick
up
on
his
return
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
thought
he
might
set
some
that
day
although
it
was
the
day
of
rest
careful
not
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
religious
instruction
any
native
has
received
from
any
source
i
told
him
that
was
a
matter
for
him
to
decide
himself
that
each
man
was
responsible
for
his
own
conduct
the
boy
thought
awhile
and
he
did
not
set
his
traps
now
that
young
man
had
never
received
any
instruction
at
a
mission
all
his
teaching
had
been
from
other
esquimaux
this
same
question
of
working
on
sunday
was
the
cause
of
some
of
the
difficulty
between
the
missionary
at
long
beach
and
the
miners
at
shungnak
the
sluicing
or
season
is
short
and
mining
operators
generally
consider
that
they
can
not
afford
to
lose
an
hour
of
it
the
kobuks
employed
by
these
miners
quit
their
work
on
sunday
and
that
brought
the
operations
to
a
standstill
there
was
something
to
be
said
on
the
miners
side
but
i
rejoiced
that
the
esquimau
boys
showed
such
steadfastness
to
their
teaching
if
you
can
not
use
them
six
days
in
the
week
if
it
has
to
be
seven
or
none
then
do
as
the
miners
on
the
yukon
side
do
consider
the
country
uninhabited
and
make
your
arrangements
as
though
there
were
no
kobuks
that
was
my
advice
and
this
may
be
read
in
connection
with
stefanson
caustic
comments
on
the
same
rigidity
of
observance
we
left
long
beach
with
a
grateful
feeling
for
the
hospitality
with
which
we
had
been
received
and
with
a
substantial
respect
for
the
earnest
missionary
effort
that
was
being
put
forth
there
we
were
able
to
replenish
our
grub
supply
and
also
to
exchange
our
two
toboggans
for
one
large
sled
for
we
were
out
of
the
toboggan
country
again
and
they
had
already
become
a
nuisance
slipping
and
sliding
about
on
the
trail
our
host
was
up
early
with
a
good
breakfast
for
us
and
speeded
the
parting
guest
which
on
the
trail
is
certainly
an
essential
part
of
true
hospitality
with
all
the
honours
the
natives
lined
up
on
the
bank
and
the
younger
ones
running
along
with
us
for
a
few
hundred
yards
sidenote
the
jade
mountains
soon
after
we
left
the
mission
we
went
up
a
series
of
terraces
to
a
desolate
barren
flat
the
portage
across
which
cut
off
a
great
bend
of
the
river
and
saved
us
many
miles
of
travel
to
our
right
rose
the
jade
mountains
whence
the
supply
of
this
stone
which
used
to
be
of
importance
for
and
other
implements
was
obtained
and
carried
far
and
wide
a
light
crust
on
the
snow
broke
through
at
every
step
though
the
snow
was
not
deep
enough
and
the
ground
too
uneven
to
make
useful
so
we
all
had
more
or
less
sore
feet
that
night
when
we
regained
the
river
and
made
our
camp
near
the
mouth
of
the
ambler
another
tributary
from
the
north
the
next
day
was
an
exceedingly
long
tedious
day
the
kobuk
river
which
in
its
upper
reaches
is
a
very
picturesque
stream
began
now
to
be
as
monotonous
as
the
lower
yukon
it
had
grown
to
considerable
size
and
the
bends
to
be
great
curves
of
many
miles
at
a
stretch
one
of
which
a
decided
bend
to
the
north
of
the
general
westerly
direction
of
the
river
we
were
three
full
hours
in
passing
down
it
was
while
traversing
this
bend
that
we
witnessed
a
singular
mirage
that
lent
to
the
day
all
the
enlivenment
it
had
before
us
for
ten
or
twelve
miles
stretched
the
broad
white
expanse
of
the
river
bed
shimmering
in
the
mellow
sunlight
and
far
beyond
remote
but
clear
rose
the
sharp
white
peaks
of
the
mountains
that
divide
the
almost
parallel
valleys
of
the
kobuk
and
the
noatak
as
we
travelled
these
distant
peaks
began
to
take
the
most
fantastic
shapes
they
flattened
into
a
level
and
then
they
shot
up
into
pinnacles
and
spires
then
they
shrank
together
in
the
middle
and
spread
out
on
top
till
they
looked
like
great
domed
mushrooms
then
the
broad
convex
tops
separated
themselves
entirely
from
their
bases
and
hung
detached
in
the
sky
with
daylight
underneath
and
then
these
mushroom
tops
stretched
out
laterally
and
threw
up
peaks
of
their
own
until
there
were
distinct
duplicate
ranges
one
on
the
earth
and
one
in
the
sky
it
was
fascinating
to
watch
these
whimsical
vagaries
of
nature
that
went
on
for
hours
a
change
in
own
position
from
erect
to
stooping
caused
the
most
convulsive
contortions
and
when
once
i
lay
down
on
the
trail
that
i
might
view
the
scene
through
the
lowest
stratum
of
the
agitated
air
every
peak
shot
up
suddenly
far
into
the
sky
like
the
outspreading
of
one
fingers
to
subside
as
suddenly
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
again
the
psalmist
query
came
naturally
to
the
mind
why
hop
ye
so
ye
hills
and
our
kobuk
boy
roxy
whose
enjoyment
of
fine
landscapes
and
strange
sights
was
always
a
pleasure
to
witness
answered
the
unspoken
question
god
make
mountains
dance
because
spring
come
he
said
prettily
enough
then
we
crossed
another
portage
and
cut
off
ten
miles
of
river
by
it
and
when
we
reached
the
river
again
i
wanted
to
stop
for
it
grew
towards
evening
and
here
was
good
but
we
had
lately
met
some
travelling
kobuks
and
they
had
told
roxy
of
a
cabin
just
little
way
farther
on
and
i
yielded
to
the
rest
of
the
company
who
would
push
on
to
it
and
thus
avoid
the
necessity
of
making
camp
that
native
just
little
way
is
worse
than
the
scotch
mile
and
a
bittock
indeed
the
natives
have
poor
notion
of
distance
in
general
and
miles
have
as
vague
meaning
to
them
as
kilometres
have
to
the
average
sidenote
a
belated
camp
on
and
on
we
pushed
mile
after
mile
and
still
no
cabin
in
the
gathering
dusk
we
would
continually
think
we
saw
it
trees
or
sloping
branches
simulating
gables
at
last
it
grew
quite
dark
and
when
there
was
general
agreement
that
we
must
seek
the
cabin
no
longer
but
camp
there
was
no
place
to
camp
in
either
the
bank
was
inaccessible
or
there
was
lack
of
dry
timber
we
went
on
thus
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
until
and
then
made
camp
by
in
a
poor
place
at
that
having
trudged
miles
that
day
a
camp
is
always
an
uncomfortable
camp
and
an
uncomfortable
camp
means
a
miserable
night
which
must
pay
for
we
did
not
get
to
bed
till
nearly
midnight
and
it
was
when
we
started
out
next
morning
and
we
made
only
fifteen
miles
that
day
the
kobuk
valley
continued
to
open
out
wider
and
wider
and
the
mountains
right
and
left
to
recede
the
jade
mountains
were
now
dim
and
distant
behind
us
and
new
ranges
were
coming
into
view
the
people
on
this
lower
river
are
very
few
it
was
just
about
one
hundred
miles
from
long
beach
when
we
reached
the
next
native
village
a
miserable
collection
of
pole
dwellings
half
underground
with
perhaps
a
score
of
inhabitants
certainly
the
conditions
of
life
deteriorated
as
we
descended
this
river
the
country
seems
to
afford
nothing
but
fish
we
were
amongst
the
ichthyophagi
pure
and
simple
roxy
bred
and
born
on
the
upper
kobuk
and
never
so
far
down
before
is
very
scornful
about
it
me
no
likee
this
country
he
says
no
caribou
no
ptarmigan
no
rabbits
no
timber
no
nothin
the
weather
had
grown
raw
and
cold
again
with
a
constant
disagreeable
wind
that
took
all
the
fun
out
of
travelling
we
passed
a
place
where
a
white
man
was
pessimistically
picking
away
at
a
vein
of
coal
in
the
river
bluff
yes
we
been
here
all
winter
he
said
working
on
the
blamed
ledge
i
always
knowed
it
was
goin
to
pinch
out
and
now
it
begun
to
pinch
my
partner
gone
to
candle
for
more
grub
but
i
told
him
it
were
no
use
it
pinchin
out
right
now
i
knowed
it
afore
we
started
work
but
the
blamed
fool
would
listen
to
me
pinch
out
i
told
him
a
dozen
times
mark
my
word
pinch
out
i
told
him
and
now
it
begun
to
pinch
and
i
hope
he
be
satisfied
we
were
reminded
of
the
many
from
time
to
time
located
on
the
yukon
in
all
or
nearly
all
of
which
the
vein
has
pinched
out
the
deposits
on
the
coast
may
be
all
the
fancy
of
the
magazine
writer
paints
and
may
hold
the
incalculable
wealth
that
is
attributed
to
them
but
the
coal
on
the
interior
rivers
seems
in
scant
measure
and
of
inferior
quality
the
same
night
we
reached
the
native
village
at
the
mouth
of
the
squirrel
river
another
northern
tributary
the
kobuk
receives
most
of
its
waters
from
the
north
and
we
spent
the
night
and
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
in
one
of
the
huts
of
the
place
in
company
with
twelve
other
people
here
we
found
roxy
brother
dubbed
napoleon
by
some
white
man
they
had
not
seen
one
another
for
years
yet
all
the
greeting
was
a
mutual
grunt
the
kobuks
are
not
demonstrative
in
their
affections
but
it
would
not
be
right
to
conclude
the
affection
lacking
i
have
seen
an
old
esquimau
woman
taking
part
in
a
dance
the
night
after
her
husband
was
buried
yet
it
would
have
been
unjust
to
have
concluded
that
she
was
callous
and
indifferent
it
is
very
easy
to
misunderstand
a
strange
people
and
very
hard
to
understand
them
thoroughly
sidenote
the
canine
intruder
the
roof
of
the
tent
was
and
it
was
lit
by
a
skylight
in
the
morning
while
i
was
conducting
divine
service
and
attempting
most
lamely
by
the
mouth
of
a
poor
interpreter
to
convey
some
instruction
a
dog
fight
outside
adjourned
to
the
roof
and
presently
both
combatants
came
tumbling
through
the
gut
window
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
they
were
unceremoniously
picked
up
and
flung
out
of
the
door
a
few
stitches
with
a
needleful
of
sinew
repaired
the
window
and
the
proceedings
were
resumed
these
gut
windows
have
their
convenience
as
well
as
their
inconvenience
when
the
hut
gets
too
warm
and
close
even
for
esquimaux
the
seal
gut
is
folded
back
and
the
outer
air
rushes
in
to
the
great
refreshment
of
the
occupants
when
the
hut
is
cool
enough
the
gut
is
replaced
a
skylight
is
far
and
away
the
best
method
of
illuminating
any
structure
and
this
membrane
is
remarkably
translucent
while
the
snow
that
falls
or
frost
that
forms
upon
such
a
skylight
is
quickly
removed
by
beating
the
hand
upon
the
surface
all
glass
windows
must
be
double
glazed
or
else
in
the
very
cold
weather
they
are
quickly
covered
with
a
thick
deposit
of
frost
from
the
condensation
of
the
moisture
inside
the
room
and
then
they
admit
much
less
light
than
gut
does
one
of
its
unpleasant
features
is
the
way
the
membrane
snaps
back
and
forth
with
a
report
like
a
pistol
whenever
the
door
is
opened
and
shut
but
on
the
whole
it
is
a
very
good
substitute
for
glass
indeed
sidenote
sleeping
customs
these
river
esquimaux
vary
greatly
in
physical
appearance
while
many
of
them
are
somewhat
undersized
and
all
have
small
feet
and
hands
some
are
specimens
of
manhood
riley
jim
the
chief
of
this
tribe
would
be
counted
a
tall
stalwart
man
anywhere
and
while
many
have
coarse
squat
features
here
and
there
is
one
who
is
decidedly
attractive
in
appearance
a
sweet
smile
which
is
often
upon
the
face
and
small
regular
white
teeth
greatly
help
to
redeem
any
countenance
a
youth
of
about
eighteen
at
the
squirrel
river
would
properly
be
called
handsome
one
thinks
though
amongst
native
people
one
grows
a
little
afraid
of
forgetting
standards
of
comparison
and
his
wife
for
he
was
already
a
husband
was
a
decidedly
pretty
girl
a
word
ought
to
be
said
which
applies
to
all
the
esquimaux
we
met
although
many
people
live
in
one
hut
and
there
is
no
possible
privacy
yet
we
saw
no
immodesty
of
any
sort
they
sleep
entirely
nude
probably
our
own
did
the
same
at
least
the
people
of
defoe
and
smollet
did
for
nightshirts
and
pyjamas
are
very
modern
things
there
is
much
to
be
said
from
an
hygienic
point
of
view
in
favour
of
that
custom
as
against
turning
in
all
standing
as
the
indian
generally
does
or
sleeping
in
the
day
underwear
as
most
white
men
do
but
although
every
one
of
a
dozen
people
in
cabin
after
cabin
that
we
stayed
at
on
the
kobuk
river
above
and
below
this
place
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
would
thus
strip
completely
and
go
to
bed
there
was
never
any
exposure
of
the
body
at
all
it
may
be
of
course
that
our
presence
imposed
a
greater
care
in
this
respect
but
it
did
not
so
impress
us
it
seemed
the
normal
thing
another
noticeable
feature
of
the
lives
of
all
these
people
was
their
devoutness
in
the
matter
of
thanks
before
and
after
meat
some
of
them
would
not
so
much
as
give
and
receive
a
drink
of
cold
water
without
a
long
responsive
grace
as
we
went
on
down
the
river
the
country
grew
bleaker
and
drearier
and
the
few
scattered
inhabitants
were
living
more
and
more
the
life
of
the
seacoast
the
dwellings
resembled
igloos
more
than
cabins
being
completely
covered
with
snow
and
approached
by
underground
passages
with
heavy
flaps
of
untanned
sealskin
to
close
them
when
we
passed
a
fork
of
the
river
we
knew
that
we
were
entering
the
delta
of
the
kobuk
and
that
another
day
would
take
us
to
the
mission
on
kotzebue
sound
it
was
a
long
hard
day
in
which
we
made
forty
miles
but
an
interesting
one
with
a
start
at
six
we
were
at
the
mouth
by
the
spruce
which
had
for
some
time
been
dwarfing
and
dwindling
gave
place
to
willows
the
willows
shrank
to
shrubs
the
shrubs
changed
to
coarse
grass
thrusting
yellow
tassels
through
the
snow
the
river
banks
sank
and
flattened
out
and
ceased
and
we
were
on
hotham
inlet
with
the
long
of
the
peninsula
that
forms
it
stretching
away
north
and
south
in
the
distance
roxy
bewilderment
was
amusing
he
stopped
and
gazed
about
him
and
said
kobuk
river
all
pechuk
pechuk
means
played
out
what
the
matter
no
more
kobuk
river
i
think
his
mind
had
never
really
entertained
the
notion
of
the
river
ending
though
of
course
he
must
often
have
heard
of
its
mouth
in
the
salt
water
he
was
out
of
his
country
his
bearings
all
gone
a
feeling
of
helpless
insecurity
taking
the
place
of
his
usual
confidence
and
i
think
he
said
no
more
all
that
day
we
had
to
traverse
the
ice
of
hotham
inlet
northward
to
its
mouth
double
the
end
of
the
peninsula
and
then
travel
south
along
the
coast
to
the
mission
at
kikitaruk
the
peninsula
being
too
rugged
to
cross
three
considerable
rivers
drain
into
hotham
inlet
roughly
parallel
in
their
east
and
west
courses
the
noatak
the
kobuk
and
the
selawik
so
that
its
waters
must
be
commonly
more
fresh
than
salt
for
its
bounds
are
narrow
and
the
extensive
delta
of
its
eastern
shore
would
argue
its
depth
slight
ahead
of
us
as
we
travelled
north
making
a
for
the
end
of
the
peninsula
all
the
afternoon
loomed
the
rocky
promontory
of
krusenstern
one
of
kotzebue
capes
and
far
beyond
stretching
up
the
dim
lay
the
way
to
point
hope
it
was
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
that
i
gazed
upon
it
for
i
knew
already
though
i
had
not
announced
a
decision
that
the
road
to
point
hope
could
not
be
my
road
that
year
all
day
long
the
thermometer
stood
between
and
and
the
constant
light
kept
scarfs
wrapped
closely
about
mouths
and
noses
which
always
means
disagreeable
travel
when
the
company
stopped
at
noon
to
eat
a
little
frozen
lunch
i
was
too
chilly
to
cease
my
movement
and
pressed
on
the
day
of
that
blessed
comfort
of
the
trail
the
thermos
flask
was
not
yet
by
we
had
reached
pipe
spit
which
still
further
contracts
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
inlet
and
turning
west
for
a
mile
or
two
rounded
the
point
and
then
turned
south
for
ten
miles
along
the
coast
just
about
dark
we
reached
the
mission
and
stood
gazing
out
over
the
rough
ice
of
kotzebue
sound
to
the
arctic
ocean
having
made
the
forty
miles
in
ten
and
a
half
hours
we
had
come
about
one
thousand
miles
from
fairbanks
all
of
it
on
foot
and
most
of
it
on
sidenote
the
arctic
ocean
so
here
was
my
first
sight
of
the
arctic
ocean
all
day
long
i
had
anticipated
it
and
it
stirred
me
a
dim
grey
expanse
stretching
vast
and
vague
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
old
navigators
whose
stories
i
had
read
as
a
boy
passed
before
me
in
their
wonderful
bold
sailing
vessels
going
in
and
out
uncharted
waters
that
steamships
will
not
venture
kotzebue
beechey
collinson
mcclure
pushing
resolutely
northward
less
happy
had
been
my
first
sight
of
the
pacific
ocean
five
years
before
i
had
the
ill
luck
to
come
upon
it
by
way
of
that
western
coney
island
santa
monica
and
from
the
and
cheap
eating
places
balboa
and
magellan
and
franky
drake
fled
away
incontinent
and
would
not
be
conjured
back
though
indeed
the
original
discoverers
would
have
had
yet
further
occasion
to
gaze
at
one
another
with
a
wild
surmise
if
they
had
seen
shrieking
companies
shooting
the
chutes
but
here
was
vastness
here
was
desolation
here
was
silence
jagged
ice
masses
in
the
foreground
and
boundless
expanse
beyond
solemn
and
mysterious
the
arctic
ocean
was
even
as
i
had
pictured
it
the
missionary
in
charge
at
kikitaruk
had
been
informed
by
letter
of
our
projected
journey
during
the
previous
summer
and
had
long
expected
us
we
were
received
with
kindness
and
hospitality
and
after
supper
began
at
once
our
acquaintance
with
his
work
for
there
was
a
service
that
night
which
it
was
thought
we
should
attend
i
spoke
for
a
few
minutes
through
an
excellent
interpreter
and
then
spent
a
couple
of
hours
nodding
over
the
stove
overcome
with
sleep
while
there
was
much
singing
and
testimony
sidenote
esquimaux
the
californian
society
of
friends
established
here
a
number
of
years
with
branches
at
other
points
on
kotzebue
sound
has
done
an
excellent
work
amongst
the
esquimaux
if
they
had
accomplished
nothing
else
it
would
stand
to
the
everlasting
credit
of
the
society
missionaries
that
they
have
succeeded
in
imbuing
the
natives
under
their
charge
with
a
total
aversion
to
all
intoxicating
liquor
we
had
come
down
from
the
remotest
points
to
which
the
influence
of
these
people
has
extended
we
had
met
their
natives
five
hundred
miles
away
from
their
base
of
instruction
and
everywhere
we
found
the
same
thing
it
was
said
by
the
white
men
on
the
koyukuk
that
a
kobuk
could
not
be
induced
to
take
a
drink
of
whisky
it
seemed
to
us
a
pity
that
the
force
of
this
most
wholesome
doctrine
should
be
weakened
by
the
unsuccessful
attempt
to
include
tobacco
in
the
same
rigorous
prohibition
in
several
cabins
where
we
stayed
there
was
no
sign
of
smoking
until
members
of
our
party
produced
pipes
whereupon
other
pipes
were
furtively
produced
and
the
tobacco
that
was
offered
was
eagerly
accepted
from
any
rational
point
of
view
the
putting
of
whisky
and
tobacco
in
the
same
category
is
surely
a
folly
there
can
be
few
more
harmless
indulgences
to
the
native
than
his
pipe
and
no
one
knows
the
solace
of
the
pipe
until
he
has
smoked
it
around
the
in
the
arctic
regions
after
a
hard
day
journey
the
decision
to
turn
my
back
on
point
hope
was
i
think
the
most
painful
decision
i
ever
made
in
my
life
with
all
my
heart
i
wanted
to
go
on
it
was
only
one
hundred
and
sixty
or
one
hundred
and
seventy
miles
away
the
journey
had
been
made
in
three
or
four
days
but
we
were
now
come
to
a
country
where
travel
is
impossible
in
bad
weather
and
where
bad
weather
prevails
and
that
journey
might
quite
as
likely
take
two
weeks
i
worked
over
the
calendar
in
my
diary
figuring
how
many
days
of
travel
still
remained
allowing
reasonable
margins
and
i
could
not
see
that
i
had
much
more
than
time
to
get
back
to
fairbanks
before
the
which
for
sufficient
reason
i
regarded
as
my
first
duty
the
day
of
rest
at
kikitaruk
was
washington
birthday
the
of
february
eight
weeks
would
bring
us
to
the
april
by
which
time
the
trails
would
be
already
breaking
up
counting
out
sundays
that
left
days
of
travelling
with
something
like
twelve
hundred
miles
yet
to
make
without
going
to
point
hope
an
average
of
about
miles
a
day
i
knew
that
we
had
made
no
such
average
in
the
distance
already
covered
and
though
i
knew
also
that
travelling
improved
generally
as
the
season
advanced
i
did
not
know
how
very
much
better
going
there
is
on
the
snows
of
the
coast
when
travelling
is
possible
at
all
again
and
again
i
have
regretted
that
i
did
not
take
the
chance
and
push
on
but
at
the
time
i
decided
as
i
thought
i
ought
to
decide
and
one
has
no
real
compunctions
when
that
is
the
case
sidenote
the
resolution
to
turn
south
so
a
knowledge
of
our
own
most
interesting
work
among
the
esquimaux
was
not
for
me
on
that
occasion
and
there
has
arisen
no
opportunity
since
knapp
who
had
planned
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
winter
at
point
hope
would
get
a
guide
and
a
team
here
and
turn
north
after
some
days
rest
while
i
would
turn
south
roxy
was
impatient
to
return
to
bettles
me
no
likee
this
country
was
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
him
so
i
paid
him
his
money
and
made
him
a
present
of
the
repeating
rifle
with
which
he
had
killed
so
many
ptarmigan
on
the
journey
outfitted
him
with
clothes
grub
and
ammunition
and
let
him
go
saying
with
regret
for
he
was
a
good
boy
to
us
all
the
way
it
was
late
on
the
night
of
our
single
day
of
rest
when
i
got
to
bed
for
there
had
been
squaring
up
of
accounts
and
much
writing
and
when
i
went
to
bed
i
did
not
sleep
again
and
again
i
reviewed
the
decision
i
had
come
to
and
fought
against
it
though
such
is
far
from
my
common
habit
even
as
i
write
years
after
the
bitter
rebellious
reluctance
with
which
i
turned
south
comes
back
to
me
i
wished
the
hospital
at
fairbanks
at
the
bottom
of
the
deep
blue
sea
i
protested
i
would
go
on
and
complete
my
journey
even
though
it
involved
thawing
out
at
tanana
and
getting
to
fairbanks
on
a
steamboat
in
the
summer
i
had
a
free
hand
a
kindly
and
complaisant
bishop
and
none
would
call
me
strictly
to
account
then
i
realised
that
it
was
merely
pride
of
purpose
resolution
of
accomplishing
what
had
been
essayed
in
a
word
personal
gratification
for
which
i
was
fighting
and
with
that
realisation
came
surrender
and
sleep
chapter
iv
the
seward
peninsula
candle
creek
council
and
nome
one
day
rest
was
not
a
great
deal
after
the
distance
we
had
come
and
that
day
fully
occupied
with
business
but
since
point
hope
was
abandoned
some
sort
of
schedule
must
be
made
for
the
seward
peninsula
and
where
sunday
shall
be
spent
is
always
an
important
factor
in
arranging
these
itineraries
there
was
just
time
to
reach
candle
for
the
next
sunday
and
it
was
decided
to
attempt
it
hans
would
accompany
me
as
far
as
candle
where
he
hoped
to
find
work
it
meant
two
days
of
miles
each
for
it
is
ninety
miles
from
kikitaruk
to
candle
but
they
told
us
it
could
be
done
so
the
reluctant
adieus
made
letters
despatched
some
mailed
here
at
kikitaruk
some
to
be
carried
back
to
bettles
and
mailed
there
these
latter
getting
outside
long
before
the
former
we
started
at
seven
in
the
morning
instead
of
six
as
we
had
planned
on
the
journey
down
the
shore
of
kotzebue
sound
that
hour
delay
turned
out
to
be
a
calamity
for
us
the
trail
was
smooth
along
the
beach
until
cape
blossom
was
reached
and
i
had
the
first
riding
of
the
winter
hans
and
i
alternately
running
and
jumping
on
the
sled
there
was
a
portage
across
the
cape
and
three
or
four
miles
below
it
was
the
wreck
of
the
river
steamer
which
used
to
make
a
voyage
up
the
kobuk
with
supplies
for
the
miners
at
the
shungnak
the
thermometer
was
at
when
we
started
and
the
same
light
but
keen
breeze
was
blowing
that
had
annoyed
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
peninsula
what
a
barren
desolate
region
it
is
low
rocks
sinking
away
to
the
dead
level
of
the
on
the
one
hand
nothing
but
the
on
the
other
sidenote
a
bad
night
sidenote
camped
in
the
open
we
were
bound
for
an
igloo
miles
from
the
mission
the
only
shelter
between
kikitaruk
on
the
peninsula
and
kewalik
on
the
mainland
and
we
had
been
warned
that
the
igloo
would
be
easy
to
miss
if
it
grew
dark
as
it
would
be
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
of
the
shore
some
directions
from
a
multitude
of
counsellors
remembered
in
one
sense
by
hans
and
in
another
by
me
added
to
our
uncertainty
as
to
just
where
the
igloo
lay
the
wind
increased
in
force
as
the
evening
advanced
and
the
last
time
i
looked
at
the
thermometer
it
still
registered
the
sun
set
over
the
sound
with
another
of
those
curious
distortions
which
had
before
proved
ominous
to
us
it
was
flattened
and
swollen
out
like
a
chinese
lantern
with
a
neck
to
it
and
an
irregular
veining
over
its
surface
that
completed
the
resemblance
the
wind
increased
until
the
air
was
full
of
flying
snow
and
it
grew
dark
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
igloo
only
slowly
and
with
much
difficulty
could
the
trail
be
followed
and
that
meant
we
were
soon
not
moving
fast
enough
to
keep
warm
in
the
fierce
wind
at
last
we
lost
the
trail
altogether
and
sometimes
we
found
ourselves
out
on
the
rough
ice
of
the
sound
and
sometimes
wallowing
in
a
fresh
on
the
shore
i
became
possessed
with
the
fear
that
we
had
passed
the
igloo
i
was
positive
that
we
were
told
at
the
mission
that
we
should
reach
it
the
high
bluffs
were
passed
and
we
had
passed
them
a
long
way
and
had
now
but
a
shallow
shelf
to
mark
the
it
is
strange
how
long
that
delusion
about
passing
his
destination
will
pursue
the
alaskan
traveller
presently
the
dogs
dropped
off
a
steep
bank
in
the
dark
and
only
by
good
fortune
we
were
able
to
keep
the
heavy
sled
from
falling
upon
them
for
they
were
dead
tired
and
lay
where
they
dropped
with
freezing
fingers
i
unhitched
the
dogs
while
hans
held
the
sled
and
we
lowered
it
safely
down
but
it
was
plain
that
it
was
dangerous
to
proceed
we
could
not
find
the
trail
again
and
were
growing
alarmingly
cold
we
were
up
against
it
as
they
say
here
up
against
it
good
and
strong
we
had
a
tent
but
no
means
of
putting
it
up
a
stove
but
nothing
to
burn
in
it
a
grub
box
full
of
food
but
no
way
to
cook
it
so
the
first
night
of
coast
travel
was
to
show
us
the
full
rigour
and
inhospitality
of
the
coast
and
to
make
us
long
for
the
interior
again
wood
can
almost
always
be
found
there
within
a
few
miles
if
it
be
not
immediately
at
hand
and
no
one
properly
appreciates
the
hospitality
of
a
clump
of
until
he
has
spent
a
night
of
storm
lying
out
on
this
barren
coast
we
turned
the
dogs
loose
and
threw
them
a
fish
apiece
unlashed
the
sled
and
got
out
our
bedding
i
had
been
sleeping
in
robes
hans
in
a
shedding
that
was
my
pet
aversion
when
he
crawled
out
in
the
morning
he
was
so
covered
with
hair
that
he
looked
like
a
caribou
and
the
miserable
hairs
were
always
getting
into
the
food
we
fished
them
out
of
the
coffee
pulled
them
out
of
the
butter
and
picked
them
out
of
the
bread
but
now
in
that
he
had
an
enormous
advantage
we
lay
side
by
side
on
the
snow
in
the
lee
of
the
sled
and
tuck
myself
up
with
blanket
and
robe
as
i
would
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
swirling
snow
from
coming
in
i
called
the
dogs
to
me
and
made
them
lie
on
my
feet
and
up
against
my
side
and
so
long
as
they
lay
still
i
could
get
a
little
warmth
but
whenever
they
rose
and
left
me
i
grew
numb
again
but
hans
in
his
was
snoring
the
bag
is
the
only
bedding
on
the
coast
added
to
the
physical
discomfort
of
that
sleepless
shivery
night
was
some
mental
uneasiness
there
was
no
telling
to
what
height
the
storm
might
rise
nor
how
long
it
might
continue
sometimes
travellers
overtaken
in
this
way
on
the
coast
have
to
lie
in
their
for
three
days
and
nights
before
they
can
resume
their
journey
the
only
interest
the
night
held
was
the
thought
that
came
to
me
that
as
nearly
as
i
could
tell
we
camped
exactly
on
the
arctic
circle
the
long
night
dragged
its
slow
length
to
the
dawn
at
last
and
the
wind
moderated
a
little
at
the
same
time
so
with
the
first
streak
in
the
east
i
awoke
hans
we
gathered
our
poor
dogs
together
rolled
up
the
bedding
and
resumed
our
journey
two
miles
farther
on
was
the
igloo
our
calls
awoke
some
one
and
we
were
bidden
to
enter
descending
a
ladder
and
crawling
through
a
dark
passage
we
came
in
to
the
grateful
warmth
and
shelter
the
chamber
was
crowded
with
sleeping
esquimaux
and
reeked
with
seal
oil
and
fish
but
hans
said
it
looked
good
and
smelled
good
to
him
and
so
it
did
to
me
also
one
has
to
lie
out
on
that
coast
in
a
storm
to
appreciate
the
value
of
mere
shelter
we
went
at
once
to
cooking
for
we
had
eaten
nothing
but
a
doughnut
or
two
in
hours
and
surely
never
meal
was
more
relished
than
the
reindeer
steaks
and
the
coffee
we
took
amongst
those
still
sleeping
esquimaux
i
should
have
liked
to
spend
the
day
and
the
next
night
there
for
they
were
friendly
and
kindly
but
the
wind
had
moderated
somewhat
and
there
was
still
a
chance
to
reach
candle
for
sunday
with
the
offer
of
a
sack
of
flour
at
kewalik
we
induced
a
couple
of
esquimaux
to
accompany
us
for
i
knew
we
had
to
cross
the
mouth
of
a
bay
over
the
ice
to
reach
the
mainland
and
i
wanted
to
take
no
more
chances
our
company
again
raised
to
four
started
out
about
nine
and
until
the
choris
peninsula
was
reached
the
trail
still
skirted
the
shore
it
is
strange
that
kotzebue
who
named
this
peninsula
of
a
peninsula
for
the
artist
who
accompanied
his
expedition
in
should
have
left
the
main
peninsula
itself
unnamed
and
that
the
british
expedition
which
named
cape
blossom
ten
years
later
should
have
failed
to
supply
the
omission
it
still
bears
no
name
on
the
map
we
portaged
across
the
choris
peninsula
and
at
the
end
of
the
portage
took
a
straight
course
across
the
mouth
of
escholtz
bay
escholtz
was
kotzebue
surgeon
for
kewalik
on
the
mainland
passing
chamisso
island
named
for
kotzebue
poet
friend
there
is
something
very
interesting
to
me
in
this
voyage
of
kotzebue
and
i
have
long
wished
to
come
across
a
full
narrative
of
it
but
the
bitter
wind
that
swept
across
that
with
the
thermometer
at
brought
one
thoughts
back
to
one
own
condition
my
hands
i
could
not
keep
warm
with
the
gear
that
had
sufficed
for
and
below
in
the
interior
and
i
was
very
glad
to
procure
from
one
of
our
native
companions
a
pair
of
caribou
mitts
with
the
hair
inside
an
almost
invulnerable
gauntlet
against
cold
if
that
wind
had
been
in
our
faces
instead
of
on
our
sides
i
am
sure
we
could
not
have
travelled
at
all
at
last
we
won
across
the
ice
and
brought
up
at
a
comfortable
at
kewalik
about
ten
miles
from
candle
here
we
lay
overnight
taking
the
opportunity
of
thawing
out
and
drying
the
bedding
leaving
the
short
run
into
town
for
the
morning
sidenote
candle
creek
the
diggings
on
candle
creek
yield
to
the
koyukuk
diggings
only
as
the
most
northerly
gold
mining
in
the
world
although
the
general
methods
are
the
same
in
all
alaskan
camps
local
circumstances
introduce
many
differences
in
all
alaskan
camps
the
ground
is
frozen
and
must
be
thawed
down
the
timber
of
the
interior
renders
wood
the
natural
fuel
for
the
production
of
the
steam
that
thaws
the
ground
but
the
scarcity
of
wood
on
the
seward
peninsula
substitutes
coal
there
is
coal
on
the
peninsula
itself
but
of
very
inferior
quality
mixed
with
ice
one
may
see
chunks
of
coal
with
veins
of
ice
running
through
them
thrown
upon
the
fire
the
wood
of
the
interior
is
a
great
factor
in
its
commercial
and
domestic
economy
and
its
absence
on
the
seward
peninsula
makes
great
change
not
only
in
the
natural
aspect
of
the
country
but
in
the
whole
aspect
of
its
industrial
and
domestic
life
also
for
the
stove
and
the
mill
employ
no
small
percentage
of
all
the
white
men
in
the
interior
occupations
which
do
not
exist
at
all
on
the
peninsula
but
its
encompassment
by
the
sea
its
peninsularity
is
the
dominating
difference
between
the
seward
peninsula
and
the
interior
and
does
indeed
make
a
different
country
of
it
altogether
all
prices
are
very
much
lower
on
the
peninsula
because
ships
can
bring
merchandise
directly
from
the
outside
thus
amongst
those
who
have
money
to
spend
there
is
a
more
lavish
scale
of
living
than
in
the
interior
towns
and
luxuries
may
be
enjoyed
here
that
are
out
of
the
question
there
perhaps
conversely
it
is
true
that
life
on
the
peninsula
is
somewhat
harder
for
the
poorer
class
whether
a
railway
from
salt
water
to
the
would
redress
this
great
difference
in
the
cost
of
everything
may
be
doubted
railways
do
not
usually
operate
at
less
than
there
will
probably
always
be
an
advantage
in
the
cost
of
living
and
mining
in
favour
of
the
seward
peninsula
camps
there
had
been
no
public
religious
service
of
any
sort
in
candle
with
its
several
hundreds
of
population
in
three
years
so
there
was
special
satisfaction
in
having
reached
the
place
for
sunday
when
many
miners
were
in
town
from
the
creeks
and
an
overflowing
congregation
was
readily
assembled
and
there
was
great
pleasure
in
three
days
rest
at
the
hospitable
home
of
a
friend
while
the
temperature
remained
below
exacerbated
by
a
wind
that
rendered
travelling
dangerous
moreover
by
waiting
i
had
company
on
the
way
and
now
that
i
was
without
native
attendant
or
white
companion
and
disposed
if
possible
to
make
the
journey
right
across
the
peninsula
to
council
and
then
to
nome
without
engaging
fresh
assistance
i
was
doubly
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
travelling
with
two
men
bound
for
the
same
places
and
acquainted
with
the
route
sidenote
the
seward
peninsula
travelling
like
so
many
other
things
is
very
different
on
the
seward
peninsula
the
constant
winds
beat
down
and
harden
the
snow
until
it
has
a
crust
that
will
carry
a
man
anywhere
there
are
only
two
means
by
which
snow
becomes
crusted
one
is
this
packing
and
solidifying
by
the
wind
and
the
other
is
thawing
and
freezing
again
there
is
much
less
wind
in
the
interior
than
on
the
coast
and
usually
much
less
snowfall
and
the
greater
part
of
the
surface
of
the
country
is
protected
by
trees
the
climate
being
continental
instead
of
marine
is
not
subject
to
such
great
fluctuations
of
temperature
a
thaw
sufficiently
pronounced
or
sufficiently
prolonged
to
put
a
stout
crust
on
the
snow
when
freezing
is
resumed
is
a
very
rare
thing
in
the
interior
and
a
common
thing
on
the
coast
so
a
striking
difference
in
travel
at
once
manifests
itself
in
the
interior
all
the
snow
is
soft
except
on
a
beaten
trail
itself
while
in
the
seward
peninsula
all
the
snow
is
alike
hard
the
musher
is
not
confined
to
trails
he
can
go
where
he
pleases
and
his
vehicle
is
under
no
necessity
of
conforming
in
width
to
a
general
usage
of
the
country
it
may
be
as
wide
as
he
pleases
hence
the
hitching
of
dogs
two
and
three
abreast
hence
the
sleds
of
or
inches
in
width
my
tandem
rig
aroused
the
curiosity
of
those
who
saw
it
hence
many
other
differences
also
hitherto
we
had
not
dreamed
of
watering
the
dogs
since
snow
fell
now
i
found
their
mouths
bloody
from
their
ineffectual
attempts
to
dig
up
the
hard
snow
with
their
teeth
and
had
to
water
them
night
and
morning
it
is
not
the
custom
on
the
seward
peninsula
to
cook
for
the
dogs
and
dog
mushers
there
argue
the
needlessness
of
that
trouble
but
the
true
reason
is
other
and
obvious
it
is
difficult
for
the
traveller
to
get
enough
wood
to
cook
for
himself
let
alone
the
dogs
on
the
seward
peninsula
skis
are
extensively
used
when
there
is
soft
snow
the
prevalence
of
brush
almost
everywhere
in
the
interior
renders
them
of
little
use
and
they
are
therefore
little
used
being
universal
so
as
in
nearly
all
such
matters
everywhere
local
peculiarities
local
differences
local
customs
usually
arise
from
local
conditions
and
the
wise
man
will
commonly
conform
so
soon
as
he
discovers
them
there
is
almost
always
a
sufficient
reason
for
them
sidenote
a
sidling
trail
the
journey
from
candle
to
council
was
a
surprisingly
swift
one
we
covered
the
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
in
three
days
far
and
away
the
best
travelling
of
the
winter
so
far
but
the
usual
time
i
found
the
hard
snow
gives
smooth
passage
though
the
interior
of
the
peninsula
is
rugged
and
mountainous
two
prominent
elevations
the
ass
ears
standing
up
as
landmarks
during
the
first
day
of
the
journey
the
route
crossed
ridge
after
ridge
with
steep
grades
and
the
handling
of
the
heavy
sled
alone
was
too
much
for
me
again
and
again
it
was
overturned
and
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
and
more
than
i
ought
to
have
done
to
set
it
up
again
the
wind
continued
to
blow
with
violence
and
shelter
from
it
there
was
none
one
hillside
struggle
i
shall
always
remember
the
trail
sloped
with
the
hill
and
the
wind
was
blowing
directly
down
it
i
could
keep
no
footing
on
the
marble
snow
and
had
fallen
heavily
again
and
again
in
my
frantic
efforts
to
hold
sled
and
dogs
and
all
from
sweeping
down
into
a
dark
ravine
that
loomed
below
when
i
bethought
me
of
the
creepers
in
the
used
on
the
rivers
in
passing
over
glare
ice
with
these
irons
strapped
to
my
feet
i
was
able
to
stand
upright
but
it
was
only
by
a
hair
breadth
once
and
again
that
i
got
my
load
safely
across
when
i
was
wallowing
in
a
hot
bath
at
council
two
days
later
i
found
that
my
hip
and
thigh
were
black
and
blue
where
i
had
fallen
though
at
the
time
in
my
anxiety
to
save
the
dogs
and
the
sled
i
had
not
noticed
that
i
had
bruised
myself
so
judging
great
things
by
little
one
understands
how
a
soldier
may
be
sorely
wounded
without
knowing
it
in
the
heat
and
exaltation
of
battle
then
for
a
while
there
would
be
such
travel
as
one
sees
in
the
children
where
the
man
sits
in
the
sled
and
cracks
his
whip
and
is
whisked
along
as
gaily
as
you
please
such
travel
as
i
had
never
had
before
but
there
was
no
pleasure
in
it
the
wind
saw
to
that
on
the
second
day
we
crossed
death
valley
so
called
because
two
men
were
once
found
frozen
in
it
a
bleak
barren
expanse
five
or
six
miles
across
with
a
great
gale
blowing
right
down
it
charged
not
only
with
particles
of
hard
snow
but
with
spicules
of
ice
and
grains
of
sand
our
course
was
south
and
the
gale
blew
from
the
northwest
and
the
right
side
of
one
body
and
the
right
arm
were
continually
numb
from
the
incessant
beating
of
the
wind
the
parkee
hood
had
to
be
drawn
closely
all
the
time
and
the
eyes
were
sore
from
trying
to
peer
ahead
through
the
fur
edging
of
the
hood
one
grows
to
hate
that
wind
with
something
like
a
personal
animosity
so
brutal
so
malicious
does
it
seem
an
incautious
turn
of
the
head
and
the
scarf
that
protected
mouth
and
nose
was
snatched
from
me
and
borne
far
away
in
an
instant
beyond
thought
of
recovery
it
seems
to
lie
in
wait
and
one
fancies
a
fresh
shrill
of
glee
in
its
note
at
every
new
discomfiture
it
can
inflict
there
is
nothing
in
the
native
superstition
that
puts
a
malignant
spirit
in
the
wind
it
is
the
most
natural
feeling
in
the
world
i
said
so
that
night
in
camp
and
one
of
my
companions
mentioned
something
about
rude
boreas
and
i
laughed
the
gentle
myths
of
greece
do
not
fit
this
country
the
indian
name
means
the
wind
beast
and
is
appropriate
a
savage
forbidding
country
this
whole
interior
of
the
seward
peninsula
uninhabited
and
unfit
for
habitation
a
country
of
naked
rock
and
bare
hillside
and
desolate
barren
valley
without
amenities
of
any
kind
and
cursed
with
a
perpetual
icy
blast
sidenote
death
valley
the
valley
crossed
and
its
ridge
surmounted
a
still
more
experience
was
in
store
we
descended
the
frozen
bed
of
a
creek
from
which
the
wind
had
swept
every
trace
of
snow
so
that
the
ice
was
polished
as
smooth
as
glass
the
dogs
could
get
no
footing
and
were
continually
down
on
their
bellies
moving
their
legs
instinctively
but
helplessly
like
the
flippers
of
a
turtle
while
the
wind
carried
dogs
and
sled
where
it
pleased
the
grade
was
considerable
and
in
bends
the
creek
spread
out
wide
nothing
but
the
creepers
enabled
a
man
to
stand
at
all
and
creepers
and
brake
together
could
not
hold
the
sled
from
careering
sideways
across
the
ice
dragging
the
dogs
with
it
until
the
runners
struck
some
pebble
or
twig
frozen
in
the
ice
and
the
sled
would
be
violently
overturned
twice
with
freezing
fingers
i
unlashed
that
sled
lying
on
its
side
and
took
out
nearly
all
the
load
before
i
could
succeed
in
getting
it
upright
again
losing
some
of
the
lighter
articles
each
time
the
third
time
was
the
worst
of
all
the
brake
had
been
little
more
than
a
pivot
on
which
sled
and
dogs
were
swung
to
leeward
but
now
the
teeth
had
become
so
blunt
that
though
i
stood
upon
it
with
all
my
weight
it
would
not
hold
at
all
nor
check
the
sideways
motion
under
the
impulse
of
the
wind
right
across
the
creek
we
went
dragging
the
dogs
behind
jerking
them
hither
and
thither
over
the
glassy
surface
i
saw
the
rocks
towards
which
we
were
driving
but
was
powerless
to
avert
the
disaster
and
hung
on
in
some
hope
i
suppose
of
being
able
to
minimise
it
till
with
a
crash
that
broke
two
of
the
uprights
and
threw
me
so
hard
that
i
skinned
my
elbow
and
hurt
my
head
we
were
once
more
overturned
never
since
i
reached
manhood
i
think
did
i
feel
so
much
like
sitting
down
and
crying
it
seemed
hopeless
to
think
about
getting
down
that
creek
until
the
wind
stopped
and
one
doubts
if
the
wind
ever
does
stop
in
that
country
but
there
was
no
good
sitting
there
like
a
shipwrecked
mariner
nursing
sores
and
misfortunes
presently
one
would
begin
to
feel
sorry
for
oneself
that
last
resort
of
incompetence
and
the
bitter
wind
is
a
great
stimulus
it
will
not
permit
inaction
so
i
was
up
again
fumbling
at
the
sled
lashings
as
best
i
could
with
torpid
fingers
when
one
of
my
companions
uneasy
at
my
delay
very
kindly
made
his
way
back
and
with
his
assistance
i
was
able
to
get
the
sled
upright
again
without
unloading
and
hold
it
somewhat
better
on
its
course
until
another
bend
or
two
brought
us
to
the
partial
shelter
of
bluffs
and
a
little
farther
to
the
cabin
where
we
were
to
spend
the
night
i
understood
now
why
my
companions
had
a
sort
of
hinged
fastened
to
one
runner
of
their
sled
by
the
pressure
of
a
foot
the
engaged
the
ice
and
held
the
sled
on
its
course
this
is
another
seward
peninsula
device

the
kindly
swede
i
have
it
in
my
diary
that
a
swede
named
petersen
was
very
kind
to
us
at
the
cabin
cooking
for
us
and
giving

feed

never
forget
that
particular
one
kindness
the
only
man
i
met
in
the
seward
peninsula
who
still
persisted
in
cooking
dog
feed
whenever
he
could
he
had
cooked
up
a
mess
of
rice
and
fish
enough
to
last
his
three
or
four
dogs
several
days
while
he
sojourned
at
this
cabin
and
he
gave
it
all
to
us
and
would
take
nothing
for
it
his
language
was
what
truthful
james
calls
frequent
and
painful
and
free
i
ignored
it
for
a
while
loath
to
take
exception
to
anything
a
man
said
who
had
been
so
kind
but
at
last
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
it
took
all
the
savour
out
of
his
hospitality
and
i
said
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
saying
it
for
i
hate
to
give
offence
to
a
man
who
has
been
so
good
to
strangers
as
you
have
but
i
wish
you
cut
out
that
cursing
it
hurts
my
ears
he
sat
silent
a
moment
looking
straight
at
me
and
i
was
not
sure
how
he
had
taken
it
then
he
said
maybe
you
been
kinder
to
me
saying
that
than
i
been
to
you
that
the
first
time
i
ever
been
call
down
for
cursin
i
do
mean
nothin
by
it
it
just
foolishness
and
i
try
to
cut
it
out
the
dogs
had
done
but
ill
on
the
dry
fish
accustomed
as
they
were
to
cooked
food
and
they
ate
ravenously
of
their
supper
only
the
previous
night
lingo
had
betrayed
his
trust
for
the
first
and
last
time
coming
out
of
the
cabin
just
before
turning
in
to
take
a
last
look
round
i
saw
lingo
on
top
of
the
sled
eating
something
and
i
found
that
he
had
dug
a
slab
of
bacon
out
of
the
unlashed
load
and
had
eaten
most
of
it
i
knew
he
was
hungry
missing
the
filling
satisfying
mess
he
was
used
to
and
i
did
not
thrash
him
i
simply
said
oh
lingo
and
the
dog
got
off
the
sled
and
slunk
away
the
very
picture
of
conscious
shamefaced
guilt
that
was
the
only
time
he
did
such
a
thing
in
all
the
six
years
i
drove
him
council
was
past
its
prime
at
the
time
of
this
visit
but
just
as
we
entered
the
town
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
run
it
seemed
in
danger
of
going
through
all
the
stages
of
decadence
with
a
rush
to
total
destruction
out
of
hand
for
a
fire
had
broken
out
in
a
laundry
and
with
the
high
wind
still
blowing
it
looked
as
though
every
building
was
doomed
of
two
chemical
engines
possessed
by
the
town
one
refused
to
work
but
the
vigour
and
promptness
of
the
people
in
forming
two
lines
down
to
the
river
and
passing
buckets
with
the
utmost
rapidity
coped
with
the
outbreak
just
in
time
to
prevent
its
spreading
beyond
all
control
tired
as
we
were
we
all
pitched
in
and
passed
buckets
until
parkees
and
mitts
and
mukluks
were
incrusted
with
ice
from
water
that
was
spilled
efficient
protection
is
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
and
expense
in
alaskan
towns
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
has
escaped
being
swept
by
fire
the
buildings
are
almost
necessarily
all
of
wood
the
cost
of
brick
and
stone
construction
being
prohibitive
no
one
can
guarantee
ten
years
of
life
to
a
town
and
there
would
be
no
warrant
for
the
expenditure
of
the
sums
required
for
fireproof
building
even
were
the
capital
available
but
the
rapidity
with
which
they
are
rebuilt
where
rebuilding
is
justified
is
even
more
remarkable
than
the
rapidity
with
which
they
are
destroyed
a
saturday
and
sunday
were
very
welcome
at
council
and
the
courtesy
of
the
presbyterian
minister
who
gave
up
his
church
and
his
congregations
to
me
esquimaux
in
the
morning
and
white
at
night
was
much
appreciated
sidenote
norton
sound
in
warmer
weather
the
thermometer
no
lower
than
at
the
start
but
with
the
same
gale
blowing
that
had
blown
ever
since
we
left
candle
though
it
had
shifted
towards
the
northeast
we
got
away
on
monday
morning
bound
for
nome
ninety
miles
away
hoping
to
reach
the
house
that
night
five
or
six
hours
run
over
good
trails
with
no
greater
inconvenience
than
the
acceleration
of
our
pace
by
the
wind
on
down
grades
until
the
sled
frequently
overran
the
dogs
with
entanglements
and
spillings
brought
us
to
the
seacoast
at
topkok
and
a
noble
view
opened
up
as
we
climbed
the
great
bluff
there
norton
sound
spread
out
before
us
its
ice
largely
cleared
away
and
blown
into
bering
sea
by
the
strong
wind
that
had
prevailed
for
nearly
a
week
its
waves
sparkling
and
dashing
into
foam
in
the
march
sunshine
the
distant
cliffs
and
mountains
of
its
other
shore
just
visible
in
the
clear
air
it
was
an
exhilarating
sight
the
first
free
water
that
i
had
seen
since
the
summer
and
it
seemed
rejoicing
in
its
freedom
leaping
up
with
glee
to
greet
the
mighty
ally
that
had
struck
off
its
fetters
but
from
this
point
troubles
began
to
grow
we
dropped
down
presently
to
the
shore
and
passed
along
the
glare
surface
of
lagoon
after
lagoon
the
wind
doing
what
it
liked
with
the
sled
for
it
was
impossible
to
handle
it
at
all
sometimes
we
went
along
broadside
on
sometimes
the
sled
first
and
the
dogs
trailing
behind
moving
their
silly
helpless
paws
from
side
to
side
as
they
were
dragged
over
the
ice
on
their
bellies
when
we
had
passed
these
lagoons
the
trail
took
the
beach
running
alongside
and
just
to
windward
of
a
with
rough
shore
ice
to
the
left
and
bare
rocks
to
the
right
again
and
again
the
already
injured
sled
was
smashed
heavily
against
a
telephone
pole
i
would
see
the
impact
coming
and
strive
my
utmost
to
avert
it
but
without
a
gee
pole
and
swinging
the
sled
only
by
the
it
was
more
than
i
could
do
to
hold
the
sled
on
its
course
against
the
beam
wind
that
was
forcing
it
towards
the
ice
and
the
telephone
poles
and
a
gee
pole
could
not
be
used
at
the
rate
we
had
travelled
ever
since
we
left
candle
mile
after
mile
we
went
along
in
this
way
i
do
not
know
how
many
poles
i
hit
and
how
many
i
missed
but
every
pole
on
that
stretch
of
coast
was
a
fresh
and
separate
anxiety
and
menace
to
me
i
think
i
would
have
been
perfectly
willing
to
have
abolished
and
wiped
out
the
whole
invention
of
the
telephone
so
i
could
be
rid
of
those
hateful
poles
what
were
telephone
poles
doing
in
the
arctic
regions
anyway
telephone
poles
belonged
with
electric
cars
and
interurban
not
with
dog
teams
and
sleds
then
it
grew
dark
and
the
wind
increased
i
did
not
know
it
but
i
was
approaching
that
stretch
of
coast
which
is
notorious
as
the
windiest
place
in
all
alaska
a
place
the
topography
of
which
makes
it
a
natural
funnel
for
the
outlet
of
wind
should
any
be
blowing
anywhere
in
the
interior
of
the
peninsula
my
companions
were
far
ahead
long
since
out
of
sight
i
struggled
along
a
little
farther
and
just
after
a
particularly
bad
collision
and
an
overturning
i
saw
a
light
glimmering
in
the
snow
to
my
right
it
was
a
little
buried
to
the
eaves
and
over
the
roof
in
with
window
tunnels
and
a
door
tunnel
excavated
in
the
snow
i
was
yet
i
learned
five
miles
from
solomon
my
destination
but
i
hailed
this
haven
as
my
refuge
for
the
night
and
went
no
farther
more
exhausted
by
the
struggle
of
the
last
two
or
three
hours
than
by
many
an
tramp
on
it
was
a
miserable
dirty
little
shack
but
it
was
tight
it
meant
shelter
from
that
pitiless
wind
that
night
the
thermometer
stood
at
the
first
plus
temperature
in
days
by
morning
the
gale
had
greatly
diminished
and
by
the
time
i
reached
solomon
and
rejoined
my
companions
it
was
calm
the
first
calm
since
we
left
the
middle
kobuk
we
had
some
rough
ice
to
cross
to
avoid
a
long
detour
of
the
coast
and
then
we
were
back
on
the
shore
again
and
it
began
to
snow
the
snow
was
soon
done
and
the
sun
shone
but
the
new
coating
of
dazzling
white
gave
such
a
glare
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
on
the
snow
glasses
for
the
first
time
of
the
winter
and
that
is
always
a
sign
winter
draws
to
a
close
sidenote
dogs
and
reindeer
on
the
approach
to
nome
we
had
our
first
encounter
with
reindeer
and
at
once
my
dog
team
became
unmanageable
i
had
had
some
trouble
that
morning
with
a
horse
a
new
dog
i
procured
at
kikitaruk
had
never
seen
a
horse
before
and
made
frantic
efforts
to
get
at
him
leaping
at
his
haunches
as
we
passed
by
but
when
they
saw
the
reindeer
the
whole
team
set
off
at
a
run
dragging
the
heavy
sled
as
if
it
were
nothing
the
esquimau
driving
the
deer
saw
the
approaching
dogs
and
hastily
drew
his
equipage
off
the
trail
farther
inshore
standing
between
the
deer
and
the
dogs
with
a
heavy
whip
what
the
result
would
have
been
had
the
dogs
reached
the
deer
it
is
hard
to
say
i
had
kept
my
stand
on
the
step
behind
the
sled
and
managed
to
check
its
wild
career
with
the
brake
and
to
throw
it
over
and
stop
the
approach
before
the
carnivora
reached
their
immemorial
prey
herein
lies
one
of
the
difficulties
of
the
domestication
of
reindeer
in
alaska
a
country
where
so
far
dogs
have
been
the
only
domestic
animals
again
as
we
entered
the
outskirts
of
nome
the
incident
was
repeated
and
only
the
hasty
driving
of
the
reindeer
into
a
barn
prevented
the
dogs
from
seizing
the
deer
that
time
sidenote
nome
jimmy
was
long
deposed
from
his
ineffectual
leadership
and
a
little
dog
named
kewalik
the
one
i
obtained
at
kikitaruk
was
at
the
head
of
the
team
kewalik
had
never
seen
so
many
houses
before
hitherto
almost
every
cabin
he
had
reached
on
his
journeys
had
been
a
and
he
wanted
to
dive
into
every
house
we
passed
at
candle
and
council
both
our
had
been
near
the
entrance
to
the
little
town
but
now
we
had
to
pass
up
one
long
street
after
another
and
i
had
continually
to
drag
him
and
the
team
he
led
first
from
a
yard
on
this
side
of
the
road
and
then
from
one
on
the
other
the
dog
was
perfectly
bewildered
and
out
of
his
head
by
the
number
of
people
and
the
number
of
houses
he
saw
we
were
indeed
a
sorry
unkempt
uncivilised
band
man
and
dogs
with
an
old
battered
vehicle
and
we
felt
our
incongruity
with
the
new
environment
as
we
entered
the
metropolis
of
the
luxury
and
wealth
of
the
north
here
we
passed
a
jeweller
shop
the
whole
window
aglow
with
the
dull
gleam
of
gold
and
ivory
the
terrible
nugget
jewellery
so
much
affected
in
these
parts
and
the
walrus
ivory
which
is
alaska
other
contribution
of
material
for
the
ornamental
arts
here
we
passed
a
veritable
department
store
its
window
set
as
a
with
gilded
brocaded
chairs
marquetry
table
and
ormolu
clock
and
i
know
not
what
costliness
of
rug
and
curtain
it
was
all
so
strange
that
it
seemed
unreal
after
that
long
passage
of
the
savage
wilds
that
long
habitation
of
huts
and
igloos
and
tents
hitherto
we
had
often
been
fortunate
could
we
buy
a
little
flour
and
bacon
here
the
choice
comestibles
of
the
earth
were
for
sale
i
looked
askance
at
my
greasy
parkee
as
i
passed
shops
where
english
broadcloth
and
scotch
tweeds
were
displayed
at
my
worn
clumsy
mukluks
when
i
saw
pumps
but
nome
knows
how
to
welcome
the
wanderer
from
the
wilderness
and
to
make
him
altogether
at
home
there
could
be
no
warmer
hospitality
than
that
with
which
i
was
received
by
the
reverend
john
white
and
his
wife
than
that
which
i
had
at
many
a
home
during
my
week
stay
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
caused
the
building
of
a
city
where
nome
is
built
except
the
thing
that
caused
it
the
finding
of
gold
on
the
beach
itself
and
in
the
creeks
immediately
behind
it
it
has
no
harbour
or
roadstead
no
shelter
or
protection
of
any
kind
it
is
in
as
bleak
and
exposed
a
position
as
a
man
would
find
if
he
should
set
out
to
hunt
the
earth
over
for
ineligible
sites
but
nome
is
also
a
fine
instance
of
the
way
men
in
the
north
conquer
local
conditions
and
wring
comfort
out
of
bleakness
and
desolation
by
the
clever
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
the
art
of
living
comfortably
in
the
north
had
to
be
learned
and
it
has
been
learned
pretty
thoroughly
people
live
at
nome
as
well
as
they
do
outside
one
may
sit
down
to
dinners
as
well
cooked
as
well
furnished
as
well
served
as
any
dinners
anywhere
the
good
folk
of
nome
delight
in
spreading
their
dainty
store
before
the
unjaded
appetite
of
the
winter
traveller
and
it
would
be
affectation
to
deny
that
there
is
keen
relish
of
enjoyment
in
the
gleam
of
wax
candle
or
electrolier
upon
perfect
appointment
of
glass
silver
and
napery
in
the
unobtrusive
but
vigilant
service
of
chinaman
or
jap
nome
has
a
great
advantage
over
its
only
rival
in
the
interior
fairbanks
in
the
matter
of
freight
rates
the
same
merchandise
that
is
landed
at
the
one
place
for
ten
or
twelve
dollars
a
ton
within
ten
or
twelve
days
of
its
leaving
seattle
costs
fifty
or
sixty
at
the
other
and
takes
a
month
or
more
to
arrive
but
this
accessibility
in
the
summer
is
exactly
reversed
in
the
winter
no
practicable
route
has
been
discovered
along
the
uninhabited
shores
of
bering
sea
and
all
the
mail
for
nome
comes
from
valdez
to
fairbanks
and
then
down
the
yukon
and
round
norton
sound

in

fairbanks
is
within
seven
or
eight
days
of

salt
water
nome
a
full
month
after
navigation
closes
in
october
the
first
mail
does
not
commonly
reach
the
seward
peninsula
until
january
so
that
with
all
its
comforts
and
luxuries
nome
is
a
very
isolated
place
for
eight
months
in
the
year
illustration
at
nome
illustration
pulling
the
pelican
out
with
a
spanish
windlass
sidenote
mining
at
nome
we
went
out
with
the
dog
sled
to
the
diggings
a
few
miles
behind
the
town
and
a
busy
scene
we
found
enveloped
in
steam
and
smoke
here
an
old
beach
line
had
been
discovered
and
was
yielding
rich
reward
for
the
working
a
long
line
of
conical
dumps
marked
its
extension
roughly
parallel
with
the
present
shore
and
the
buckets
that
arose
from
the
depths
travelled
along
a
cable
and
at
just
the
right
moment
upset
their
contents
continually
added
to
these
heaps
all
the
winter
is
thus
excavated
and
stored
in
the
summer
when
the
streams
run
the
gold
is
sluiced
out
but
that
phrase
when
the
streams
run
covers
a
world
of
difficulty
and
expense
to
the
miner
in
some
places
in
this
seward
peninsula
ditches
thirty
and
forty
miles
long
have
been
constructed
to
insure
the
streams
running
when
and
where
they
are
needed
there
was
quite
a
little
to
do
in
nome
a
new
sled
must
be
bought
and
another
dog
and
above
all
some
arrangement
made
about
a
travelling
companion
i
was
not
willing
to
hire
a
native
who
would
have
to
return
here
and
i
was
resolved
never
again
to
travel
alone
so
i
put
an
advertisement
in
the
newspaper
desiring
communication
with
some
man
who
was
intending
a
journey
to
fairbanks
immediately
and
was
fortunate
to
meet
a
sober
reliable
man
who
undertook
to
accompany
and
assist
me
for
the
payment
of
his
travelling
expenses
the
week
wore
rapidly
away
and
i
began
to
be
eager
to
depart
mindful
of
the
eight
hundred
odd
miles
yet
to
be
covered
spring
seemed
already
here
and
summer
treading
upon
her
heels
for
the
town
was
all
slush
and
mud
from
a
decided
soft
snap
the
thermometer
standing
well
above
freezing
for
days
in
succession
a
visitor
to
this
place
is
struck
by
the
number
of
articles
made
from
walrus
ivory
exposed
for
sale
chief
amongst
them
being
a
walk
down
the
streets
would
argue
the
whole
population
given
over
to
the
incessant
playing
of
cribbage
the
explanation
is
found
in
the
difficulty
of
changing
the
direction
of
esquimau
activity
once
that
direction
is
established
these
clever
artificers
were
started
making
long
ago
and
it
seems
impossible
to
stop
them
every
summer
they
come
in
from
their
winter
hunting
with
fresh
supplies
carved
during
the
leisure
of
the
long
nights
the
beautiful
walrus
tusk
becomes
almost
an
ugly
thing
when
it
is
thus
hacked
flat
and
bored
full
of
holes
the
best
pieces
of
esquimau
carving
are
not
these
things
made
by
the
dozen
but
the
domestic
implements
made
for
their
own
use
and
some
of
this
work
is
very
clever
and
tasteful
indeed
adorned
with
fine
bold
etchings
of
the
chase
of
walrus

the

up
the

to

we
left
nome
on
the
of
march
the
night
before
being
taken
up
by
a
banquet
which
the
commercial
club
was
kind
enough
to
give
me
indeed
the
whole
stay
was
marked
by
lavish
kindness
and
hospitality
and
i
left
with
the
feeling
that
nome
was
one
of
the
most
generous
and
places
i
had
ever
visited
the
soft
weather
continued
and
made
sloppy
travel
our
course
lay
all
around
norton
sound
to
unalaklík
and
then
over
the
portage
to
kaltag
on
the
yukon
up
the
yukon
to
the
mouth
of
the
tanana
and
then
up
that
river
to
fairbanks
the
first
day
run
was
the
retracing
of
our
steps
to
solomon
and
that
was
done
without
difficulty
save
for
a
new
trouble
with
the
dogs
it
appeared
that
we
no
longer
had
any
leader
all
the
winter
through
my
team
had
been
behind
another
team
and
that
constant
second
place
had
turned
our
leaders
into
followers
we
thought
we
had
two
leaders
but
neither
one
was
willing
to
proceed
without
some
one
or
something
ahead
of
him
on
such
good
as
this
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
one
of
us
to
run
ahead
of
the
team
simply
to
please
these
and
the
whip
had
to
be
wielded
heavily
on
back
ere
he
could
be
induced
to
fill
his
proper
office
and
then
he
did
it
ill
with
constant
exasperating
stoppings
and
at
solomon
i
met
a
man
who
had
spent
some
years
with
peary
in
his
arctic
explorations
and
i
sat
up
far
into
the
night
drawing
interesting
narratives
out
of
him
so
far
as
topkok
we
were
still
retracing
our
steps
but
once
over
the
great
bluff
which
gave
no
view
this
time
owing
to
the
mist
which
accompanies
this
soft
weather
we
were
on
new
ground
our
course
lying
wholly
along
the
beach
at
bluff
was
the
most
interesting
curious
gold
mining
i
have
ever
seen
the
extraction
of
gold
from
the
sand
of
norton
sound
two
hundred
yards
or
more
out
from
the
beach
there
it
lies
under
ten
or
twelve
feet
of
water
with
the
ice
on
top
how
shall
it
be
reached
why
by
the
exact
converse
of
the
usual
alaskan
placer
mining
by
freezing
down
instead
of
thawing
down
the
ice
is
cut
away
from
the
beginning
of
a
shaft
almost
but
not
quite
down
to
the
water
leaving
just
a
thin
cake
the
atmospheric
cold
penetrating
this
cake
freezes
the
water
below
it
and
presently
the
hole
is
chopped
down
a
little
farther
leaving
always
a
thin
cake
above
the
water
a
canvas
chute
is
arranged
over
the
shaft
with
a
head
like
a
ship
ventilator
that
can
be
turned
any
way
to
catch
the
wind
gradually
the
water
is
frozen
down
and
as
it
is
frozen
more
and
more
ice
is
removed
until
the
bottom
is
reached
surrounded
and
protected
by
a
cylindrical
shaft
of
ice
then
the
sand
can
be
removed
and
the
gold
it
contains
washed
out
they
told
us
they
were
making
good
money
and
their
ingenuity
certainly
deserved
it
sidenote
ice
travel
we
stopped
that
night
at
the
native
village
of
chinnik
the
people
of
which
are
looked
after
by
a
mission
of
the
swedish
evangelical
church
on
golofnin
bay
which
we
should
cross
but
the
mission
is
off
the
trail
and
we
did
not
come
to
an
acquaintance
with
the
missionaries
of
this
body
until
we
reached
unalaklík
next
day
climbing
and
descending
considerable
grades
in
warm
misty
weather
we
reached
golofnin
bay
pursued
it
some
distance
and
left
it
by
a
very
steep
long
hill
that
was
close
to
one
thousand
feet
high
at
the
foot
of
which
we
were
once
more
on
the
beach
of
the
sound
and
at
the
for
the
night
from
that
place
the
trail
no
longer
hugged
the
coast
but
struck
out
boldly
across
the
ice
for
a
distant
headland
moses
point
where
we
lunched
and
that
point
reached
struck
out
again
for
point
most
of
the
travelling
during
a
long
day
in
which
we
made
miles
being
four
or
five
miles
from
land
the
day
was
clear
and
the
of
the
other
side
of
the
sound
which
grew
nearer
as
we
proceeded
was
subject
to
strange
distortions
of
mirage
the
that
night
nestled
picturesquely
against
a
great
bluff
and
right
across
the
ice
lay
texas
point
for
which
we
should
make
a
sometimes
the
traveller
must
go
all
round
norton
bay
but
at
this
time
the
ice
was
in
good
condition
and
our
route
cut
across
the
mouth
of
the
bay
for
miles
straight
for
the
other
side
it
was
like
crossing
from
dover
to
calais
on
the
ice
the
passage
made
the
alaskan
mainland
was
reached
once
more
the
seward
peninsula
left
behind
us
and
our
way
lay
across
desolate
tundra
strewn
with
driftwood
and
hollowed
out
here
and
there
into
little
lagoons
evidently
the
waves
sweep
clean
across
it
in
stormy
weather
when
the
sound
is
open
a
salt
marsh
in
the
midst
of
it
reared
a
sort
of
lookout
tripod
of
driftwood
thirty
or
forty
feet
high
lashed
and
nailed
together
with
a
precarious
little
platform
on
top
and
cleats
nailed
to
one
of
the
uprights
for
ascent
i
essayed
the
view
but
the
rusty
nails
broke
under
my
feet
we
deemed
it
a
hunting
tower
from
which
might
be
spied
in
the
spring
sixteen
miles
of
this
melancholy
waste
brought
us
to
the
shore
again
to
a
tiny
esquimau
village
and
a
shack
of
a
where
we
should
spend
the
night
a
little
schooner
lying
beached
in
front
of
it
if
its
exterior
were
uninviting
the
scene
as
we
entered
was
sinister
by
the
light
of
a
single
candle
though
it
was
not
yet
dark
outside
amidst
unwashed
dishes
and
general
grime
sat
an
portuguese
or
spaniard
in
a
red
toque
playing
poker
with
three
esquimaux
so
absorbed
were
they
in
the
game
that
they
had
not
heard
us
arrive
nor
seen
us
enter
with
a
brief
reluctant
interval
for
the
preparation
of
a
poor
supper
the
card
playing
went
on
all
the
evening
far
into
the
night
my
companion
discovered
that
the
chips
were
worth
a
dollar
apiece
and
judged
it
to
be
considerable
of
a
game
at
last
i
arose
from
my
bunk
and
said
that
we
were
tired
and
had
come
there
to
sleep
and
with
an
ill
grace
the
playing
was
shortly
abandoned
and
the
natives
went
off
the
arctic
shores
have
their
as
well
as
the
south
sea
islands
sidenote
unalaklík
the
next
day
was
sunday
but
i
was
anxious
to
spend
my
day
of
rest
at
unalaklík
and
most
indisposed
to
spend
it
here
so
we
got
away
with
a
very
early
start
long
before
daylight
six
or
seven
miles
of
tundra
and
lagoon
travel
and
the
trail
crossed
abruptly
a
tongue
of
land
and
struck
out
over
the
ice
for
a
cape
fifteen
miles
away
the
going
was
splendid
it
was
not
glare
ice
but
ice
upon
which
snow
had
melted
and
frozen
again
it
was
so
smooth
that
one
dog
could
have
drawn
the
sled
yet
not
so
smooth
as
to
deny
good
footing
we
kept
well
out
to
sea
passing
close
to
the
mountainous
mass
of
besborough
island
plainly
riven
by
some
ancient
convulsion
from
the
sheer
bluffs
of
the
mainland
our
only
trouble
was
in
keeping
the
dogs
well
enough
out
for
not
being
or
other
marine
species
they
had
a
hankering
after
the
land
and
a
continual
tendency
to
edge
in
to
shore
so
from
headland
to
headland
we
made
rapid
easy
traverse
thoroughly
enjoying
the
ride
munching
chocolate
and
raisins
speculating
about
the
seasons
when
it
had
been
possible
to
cross
direct
from
nome
to
saint
michael
on
the
ice
and
exchanging
stories
we
had
heard
of
the
disasters
and
hairbreadth
escapes
attending
such
overbold
venture
only
this
winter
three
men
and
a
dog
team
were
blown
out
into
bering
sea
by
a
sudden
storm
and
lay
for
four
days
in
their
drifting
up
and
down
on
an
ice
cake
until
at
last
they
were
blown
back
to
the
shore
ice
and
made
their
escape
and
there
is
a
fine
story
of
a
white
man
rescued
in
state
by
his
esquimau
wife
and
carried
for
miles
on
her
back
to
safety
at
last
we
turned
a
point
and
drew
in
to
the
shore
and
not
seeing
the
little
town
till
we
were
almost
upon
it
arrived
at
unalaklík
early
in
the
afternoon
we
had
made
the
two
hundred
and
forty
miles
as
it
is
called
from
nome
in
six
days
in
the
last
twelve
days
of
travel
we
had
covered
five
hundred
miles
an
average
of
nearly
miles
per
day
far
and
away
the
best
travelling
of
the
winter
the
preceding
five
hundred
miles
had
taken
days
we
were
in
time
to
attend
the
esquimau
services
at
the
mission
both
afternoon
and
night
and
i
found
them
very
much
the
same
as
at
kikitaruk
with
the
exception
that
the
singing
was
much
more
advanced
and
was
very
good
indeed
there
was
an
anthem
of
the
danks
type
sung
by
a
choir
the
parts
well
maintained
throughout
the
attacks
good
the
voices
under
excellent
control
that
it
pleased
and
surprised
me
to
hear
and
there
was
a
long
discourse
most
patiently
and
as
i
judged
faithfully
interpreted
by
a
esquimau
boy
it
is
well
for
those
who
speak
much
through
an
interpreter
to
listen
occasionally
to
similar
discourse
only
so
may
its
unavoidable
tediousness
be
appreciated
sidenote
government
schools
the
school
next
day
pleased
me
still
more
and
i
was
glad
that
i
had
a
at
the
place
i
heard
good
reading
and
spelling
saw
good
writing
and
listened
with
real
enjoyment
to
the
fresh
young
voices
raised
again
and
again
in
song
there
was
however
something
so
curiously
exotic
that
for
a
moment
it
seemed
irresistibly
funny
in
the
old
oaken
bucket
from
lips
that
have
difficulty
with
the
vowel
sounds
of
english
from
children
that
never
saw
a
well
and
never
will
see
one
and
i
was
irreverent
enough
to
have
much
the
same
feeling
about
i
love
thy
templed
hills
in
that
patriotic
plymouth
rock
song
which
is
so
little
adapted
for
universal
american
use
that
in
a
gibe
not
without
justice
it
has
been
called
smith
country
is
of
thee
one
wonders
if
they
sing
it
in
the
philippine
schools
and
so
far
as
these
regions
are
concerned
one
wishes
that
some
teacher
with
a
spark
of
genius
would
take
goldsmith
hint
and
write
a
simple
song
for
esquimau
children
that
should
extol
the
treasures
of
their
finny
seas
and
their
long
nights
of
revelry
and
ease
the
splendour
of
summer
perpetual
sunshine
and
the
weird
radiance
of
the
northern
lights
but
prosody
is
not
taught
in
your
normal
school
the
thing
is
a
vain
artificial
attempt
to
impose
a
whole
body
of
ideas
notions
standards
of
comparison
metaphors
similes
and
sentiments
upon
a
race
to
which
in
great
measure
they
must
ever
be
foreign
and
unintelligible
here
were
girls
reading
in
a
of
physiology
and
as
it
happened
the
lesson
that
day
was
on
the
evils
of
tight
lacing
the
reading
of
that
book
i
was
informed
is
imposed
by
special
united
states
statute
and
the
teacher
must
make
a
separate
report
that
so
much
of
it
has
been
duly
gone
through
each
month
before
the
salary
can
be
drawn
yet
none
of
those
girls
ever
saw
a
corset
or
ever
will
one
is
reminded
of
the
dear
old
lady
who
used
to
visit
the
jails
and
distribute
tracts
on
evils
of
keeping
bad
but
these
incongruities
aside
the
school
was
a
good
school
and
well
taught
the
government
appointing
the
teachers
as
i
learned
upon
the
nomination
of
the
mission
authorities
the
only
way
that
a
government
school
can
be
successful
at
any
mission
station
for
the
two
agencies
must
work
together
as
one
right
hand
works
with
one
left
to
effect
any
satisfactory
result
the
hours
spent
in
it
were
very
enjoyable
and
one
wished
one
might
have
had
opportunity
for
further
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
interesting

unalaklík
is
a
thriving
esquimau
community
noted
for
its
native
schooner
building
and
its
successful
seal
hunters
and
fishermen
we
were
rejoiced
to
see
signs
of
native
prosperity
and
advance
and
we
left
unalaklík
with
high
hope
for
its
future
here
also
was
real
rest
and
refreshment
at
a
in
alaska
are
as
various
in
quality
as
inns
are
outside
our
previous
night
halt
was
at
one
of
the
worst
this
was
one
of
the
best
the
proprietor
was
a
good
cook
and
he
did
his
best
for
us
with
omelet
and
pastry
and
young
tender
reindeer
it
has
been
said
that
keeping
in
alaska
is
like
soliciting
life
insurance
outside
the
last
resort
of
incompetence
certain
it
is
that
a
thoroughly
lazy
and
incompetent
man
may
yet
make
a
living
keeping
a
for
there
is
no
rivalry
save
at
the
more
important
points
and
travellers
are
commonly
so
glad
to
reach
any
shelter
that
they
are
not
disposed
to
be
censorious
none
the
less
when
they
find
a
man
who
takes
a
pride
in
his
business
and
an
interest
in
the
comfort
of
his
guests
they
are
highly
appreciative
sidenote
the
kaltag
portage
we
should
have
only
an
occasional
from
now
on
but
expected
to
reach
some
inhabited
cabin
each
night
our
good
travelling
was
over
though
we
did
not
know
it
we
knew
that
the
hard
snows
of
the
seward
peninsula
and
the
bare
ice
of
norton
sound
were
behind
us
but
we
kept
telling
ourselves
that
the
travel
of
all
the
winter
would
surely
have
left
a
fine
trail
on
the
yukon
we
were
now
about
miles
from
saint
michael
by
the
coast
but
taking
the
portage
from
unalaklík
to
kaltag
we
should
reach
the
yukon
river
more
than
five
hundred
miles
above
saint
michael
so
much
does
that
portage
cut
off
this
is
the
route
the
military
takes
and
we
should
travel
along
close
beside
it
much
of
the
way
until
the
yukon
was
reached
the
soft
weather
persisted
and
we
had
even
doubt
about
starting
out
in
such
a
rapid
thaw
a
visit
to
the
telegraph
station
informed
us
that
the
warm
wave
was
spread
all
over
interior
alaska
and
that
there
was
general
expectation
of
an
early
but
if
the
snow
on
the
portage
were
indeed
rapidly
going
that
was
all
the
more
reason
for
getting
across
before
it
had
altogether
gone
so
we
pulled
out
in
the
warm
muggy
weather
and
even
as
we
pulled
out
it
began
to
rain
up
the
little
unalaklík
river
water
over
the
ice
everywhere
we
went
for
a
few
miles
and
then
took
to
the
tundra
all
the
snow
had
gone
except
just
the
hard
snow
of
the
trail
a
winding
ribbon
of
white
across
the
brown
moss
the
rain
changed
to
sleet
and
back
to
rain
again
and
soon
we
were
wet
through
and
had
much
trouble
in
keeping
that
penetrating
persistent
drizzle
from
wetting
our
load
through
the
canvas
cover
though
not
an
unique
experience
it
is
rare
to
be
wet
with
rain
on
the
winter
trail
rarer
in
the
interior
probably
than
on
the
coast
once
since
on
the
kuskokwim
and
once
on
the
fortymile
it
has
happened
to
me
in
seven
winters
travel
we
pushed
on
for
thirty
miles
past
several
little
native
villages
until
we
came
to
whaleback
a
village
part
esquimau
and
part
indian
these
were
the
last
esquimaux
we
should
see
and
i
was
sorry
for
i
had
grown
to
like
very
heartily
and
to
respect
very
sincerely
this
kindly
gentle
industrious
race
surely
they
are
a
people
any
nation
may
be
proud
to
have
fringing
its
otherwise
uninhabitable
coasts
and
should
be
eager
to
aid
and
conserve
there
comes
a
feeling
of
impotent
exasperation
to
me
when
i
realise
how
many
white
men
there
are
who
speak
of
them
continually
with
the
utmost
contempt
and
see
them
dwindle
with
entire
complacency
the
same
thing
is
true
in
even
more
marked
degree
about
the
indians
of
the
interior
nine
tenths
of
the
land
will
never
have
other
inhabitant
of
that
i
am
convinced
and
the
only
question
is
shall
it
be
an
inhabited
wilderness
or
an
uninhabited
wilderness
here
lodging
with
the
natives
and
i
make
no
doubt
living
off
them
too
we
found
a
queer
skulking
white
man
whom
i
had
met
in
several
different
sections
of
interior
alaska
known
as
joe
or
the
frozen
hobo
the
arctic
regions
one
would
esteem
a
poor
place
for
the
hobo
but
this
man
manages
to
eke
out
an
existence
if
not
to
flourish
therein
work
he
will
not
under
any
circumstances
but
subsists
on
the
hospitality
of
the
whites
until
he
has
entirely
worn
it
out
and
then
removes
to
the
natives
mushing
from
camp
to
camp
and
bumming
his
way
as
he
goes
he
was
on
his
way
to
saint
michael
he
told
me
with
perfect
gravity
to
get
work
sidenote
the
before
dark
we
had
reached
our
destination
for
the
night
at
the
old
woman
mountain
the
divide
between
the
waters
of
the
yukon
and
the
waters
of
norton
sound
and
were
kindly
received
and
well
treated
at
the
telegraph
station
the
only
resort
on
this
portage
for
weary
travellers
here
is
surely
a
lonely
post
for
reasons
connected
with
the
maintenance
of
the
wires
and
the
keeping
open
of
communications
it
is
necessary
to
have
telegraph
stations
every
forty
or
fifty
miles
each
with
two
or
three
men
and
a
dog
team
and
shelter
cabins
about
between
stations
a
wind
that
blows
a
tree
down
in
the
narrow
cut
through
the
forest
for
we
were
come
to
forest
again
or
a
heavy
snowfall
that
loads
branches
until
they
fall
across
the
wires
a
post
that
comes
up
out
of
its
hole
as
the
thawing
of
spring
heaves
the
ground
around
it
or
the
caving
of
the
bank
of
a
stream
along
which
the
line
passes
any
one
of
a
dozen
such
happenings
anywhere
along
its
thousand
miles
of
course
may
put
the
entire
inland
telegraph
system
out
of
operation
and
the
young
men
in
whose
section
the
interruption
occurs
they
have
a
means
of
determining
that
must
get
out
at
once
find
the
seat
of
the
trouble
and
repair
it
in
all
sorts
of
weather
unless
the
thermometer
be
below
out
they
must
go
it
may
be
doubted
if
any
other
army
in
the
world
ever
constructed
and
maintained
a
permanent
telegraph
line
under
such
arduous
conditions
it
has
been
the
army
one
contribution
to
alaska
the
one
justification
for
the
enormous
expense
of
maintaining
army
posts
in
the
interior
indeed
it
is
often
said
by
those
who
feel
keenly
the
neglect
of
the
territory
by
the
general
government
that
this
telegraph
system
is
the
one
contribution
of
the
united
states
to
alaska
it
is
certainly
a
great
public
convenience
and
has
assisted
very
materially
in
such
development
as
the
country
has
made
the
men
of
the
deserve
great
credit
for
the
faithful
dogged
way
in
which
they
have
carried
out
year
after
year
their
difficult
and
hazardous
work
and
often
and
often
the
traveller
has
been
grateful
for
the
hospitality
which
their
cabins
have
afforded
him
they
have
not
been
an
unmixed
blessing
to
the
country
soldiers
do
not
usually
represent
the
highest
morale
of
the
nation
and
though
the
is
in
some
respect
a
picked
corps
yet
the
men
are
soldiers
with
many
of
the
soldier
characteristics
too
often
a
remote
telegraph
station
has
been
a
little
centre
of
drunkenness
gambling
and
debauchery
with
a
little
circumference
of
native
men
and
women
and
while
some
of
the
officers
of
the
corps
have
been
willing
and
anxious
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
suppress
this
sort
of
thing
in
their
scattered
and
difficult
commands
others
have
been
jealous
only
for
the
technical
efficiency
of
their
work
sidenote
more
snow
there
are
many
allowances
to
be
made
for
young
men
taken
from
the
society
of
their
kind
and
thrust
out
hundreds
of
miles
in
the
wilderness
to
sit
down
for
a
year
or
two
at
one
of
these
isolated
spots
they
may
see
no
women
save
those
amongst
a
straggling
band
of
indians
for
the
whole
time
of
their
exile
they
may
see
no
white
man
save
a
and
in
many
places
not
even
a

weeks

very
heavily
on

hands

not
always
blowing
down
nor

snapping
through

of
the
cold
and
at
some
stations
there

not

messages
sent

winter
through

a
young
man

firmly
founded

be
lowered
and
what
is
here
written
of
the
young
men
of
the
may
well
apply
in
great
measure
to
a
large
proportion
of
all
the
white
men
in
the
country
the
portage
we
had
heard
of
at
nome
became
ninety
miles
at
unalaklík
and
added
another
five
to
itself
here
so
that
although
we
had
travelled
miles
that
day
we
were
told
that
there
were
yet
ahead
before
we
reached
the
yukon
so
we
decided
not
to
attempt
it
in
one
day
and
to
rest
the
next
night
at
a
repair
cabin
miles
farther
making
a
somewhat
late
start
in
view
of
a
short
journey
it
had
been
wiser
to
have
started
early
during
our
night
at
old
woman
mountain
some
three
inches
of
snow
fell
and
we
found
as
we
descended
the
yukon
slope
that
all
the
moisture
that
had
fallen
upon
us
as
rain
the
previous
day
had
fallen
on
this
side
as
snow
the
trail
was
filled
full
and
buried
and
so
soft
and
mushy
was
it
that
although
were
badly
needed
they
were
impossible
the
snow
clung
to
them
and
came
off
the
ground
with
them
in
heavy
clogging
masses
every
time
they
were
lifted
it
clung
to
the
sled
to
the
harness
to
the
dogs
feet
to
everything
that
touched
it
it
gathered
in
snowballs
on
the
long
hair
of
the
dogs
travelling
in
warm
weather
in
loose
new
snow
is
most
disagreeable
work
we
plugged
along
for
twenty
miles
and
then
in
the
dark
in
an
open
country
with
little
patches
of
scattering
spruce
had
great
trouble
in
finding
the
trail
at
all
at
last
we
could
find
it
no
longer
and
when
there
was
no
hope
of
reaching
the
cabin
that
night
we
made
a
camp
we
had
now
no
tent
or
stove
with
us
so
a
siwash
camp
in
the
open
was
the
best
we
could
do
and
a
wet
miserable
camp
it
was
by
inexcusable
carelessness
on
my
part
candles
had
been
altogether
forgotten
in
the
replenishing
of
the
supplies
and
a
little
piece
an
inch
long
which
we
found
loose
in
the
grub
box
was
all
that
we
possessed
dogs
and
men
alike
exhausted
with
the
long
day
sweating
struggle
through
the
deep
snow
sleep
should
have
come
soundly
and
soon
it
did
to
the
rest
but
i
lay
awake
the
night
through
the
easy
riding
travel
of
the
preceding
week
had
been
a
poor
preparation
for
incessant
toil
and
i
was
too
tired
to
sleep
in
the
morning
our
bedding
was
covered
with
a
couple
of
inches
of
new
snow
my
companion
got
up
at
daylight
and
made
a
journey
of
investigation
ahead
following
the
trail
better
but
not
finding
the
cabin
we
had
thought
ourselves
within
a
mile
or
two
of
it
but
evidently
were
farther
away
however
when
we
had
eaten
a
hasty
breakfast
and
hitched
up
and
had
gone
along
the
trail
that
had
been
broken
that
morning
to
its
end
ten
yards
beyond
the
place
where
my
companion
had
turned
back
we
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
and
there
we
lay
and
rested
and
dried
things
out
all
day
and
spent
the
next
night
during
the
day
there
came
a
team
from
kaltag
and
once
again
we
enjoyed
the
delight
of
receiving
and
at
the
same
time
conferring
the
richest
gift
and
greatest
possible
benefit
to
the
traveller
a
trail
sidenote
the
yukon
once
more
the
next
evening
as
it
drew
towards
dark
after
another
day
of
soft
warm
disagreeable
travel
we
reached
the
end
of
the
portage
and
the
broad
white
yukon
stretched
before
us
once
more
our
hearts
leaped
up
and
i
think
the
dogs
hearts
leaped
up
also
at
the
sight
i
called
to
nanook
as
we
stopped
on
the
bank
nanook
there
the
good
old
yukon
again
and
he
lifted
his
voice
in
that
intelligent
significant
bark
that
surely
meant
that
he
saw
and
understood
we
had
left
the
yukon
on
the
of
december
at
fort
yukon
we
reached
it
again
on
the
of
march
at
kaltag
more
than
six
hundred
miles
lower
down
we
had
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
travel
on
its
surface
before
us
and
then
close
to
another
two
hundred
and
fifty
up
the
tanana
river
to
fairbanks
but
alas
for
the
fine
yukon
trail
we
had
promised
ourselves
as
we
looked
out
across
the
broad
river
there
was
no
narrow
dark
line
undulating
over
its
surface
nor
even
a
faint
continuous
inequality
to
hint
that
trail
had
been
on
snow
less
hideously
serene
its
perfect
smoothness
and
whiteness
were
unscarred
and
unsullied
the
trail
was
wiped
out
and
swallowed
up
by
the
late
snows
and
winds
sidenote
a
learned
jesuit
there
is
little
interest
in
lingering
over
the
long
laborious
monotonous
grind
up
that
river
on
when
one
has
looked
forward
to
pleasant
quick
travel
the
disappointment
at
slow
heavy
plodding
is
the
keener
the
first
little
bit
of
trail
we
had
was
as
we
approached
nulato
two
days
later
on
a
sunday
morning
and
it
was
made
by
the
villagers
from
below
going
up
to
church
at
the
roman
catholic
mission
we
arrived
in
time
for
service
and
enjoyed
the
natives
voices
raised
in
the
latin
chants
as
well
as
in
hymns
wisely
put
into
the
vernacular
it
is
historically
a
little
curious
to
find
roman
catholic
natives
singing
praises
in
their
own
tongue
and
protestant
missions
like
those
on
the
kobuk
and
kotzebue
sound
using
a
language
not
understanded
of
the
people
the
day
was
the
feast
of
the
annunciation
as
well
as
sunday
and
there
was
some
special
decorating
of
the
church
and
perhaps
some
elaboration
of
the
music
here
for
the
first
and
only
time
i
listened
to
a
white
man
so
fluent
and
vigorous
in
the
native
tongue
that
he
gave
one
the
impression
of
eloquence
father
jetté
of
the
society
of
jesus
is
the
most
distinguished
scholar
in
alaska
he
is
the
chief
authority
on
the
native
language
and
manners
and
customs
beliefs
and
traditions
of
the
middle
yukon
and
has
brought
to
the
patient
enthusiastic
labour
of
years
the
skill
of
the
trained
philologist
it
is
said
by
the
indians
that
he
knows
more
of
the
indian
language
than
any
one
of
them
does
and
this
is
not
hard
to
believe
when
it
is
understood
that
he
has
systematically
gleaned
his
knowledge
from
widely
scattered
segments
of
tribes
jotting
down
in
his
old
forms
of
speech
lingering
amongst
isolated
communities
and
legends
and
stories
still
remembered
by
the
aged

repeated

that
always
adorn
though
they
by
no

always
accompany
the
profession
of

is
better
able
to
understand
after
some
acquaintance
with
such
a
man
after
falling
under
the
authority
of
his
learning
and
the
charm
of
his
courtesy
the
wonderful
power
which
the
society

praiseworthy

to

fill
with
credit

and
burning
come
to
light
old
copper
kettles
and
samovars
buttons
and
glass
beads
all
sorts
of
metal
vessels
and
implements
have
been
sorted
out
from
charred
wood
and
ashes
together
with
numerous
skulls
and
quantities
of
bones
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
these
relics
was
a
brass
button
from
an
official
coat
with
the
russian
crowned
eagle
on
the
face
and
on
the
back
upon
examination
with
a
lens
the
word
birmingham
half
the
day
serving
for
our
day
of
rest
this
week
we
were
up
and
ready
to
start
early
the
next
morning
but
so
violent
a
wind
was
blowing
from
the
southeast
that
we
decided
to
remain
and
the
clatter
of
the
corrugated
iron
roof
and
the
whirling
whiteness
outside
the
windows
made
us
glad
to
be
in
shelter
as
the
day
advanced
the
wind
increased
to
almost
hurricane
force
and
the
house
in
which
we
lay
began
to
rock
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
proprietor
alarmed
for
his
dwelling
there
was
an
independent
at
this
village
which
seemed
to
present
an
in
rapacity
and
greed
there
was
not
an
article
of
standard
quality
in
the
store
the
clothing
was
the
most
rascally
shoddy
the
canned
goods
of
the
poorest
brands
the
whole
stock
the
cheapest
stuff
that
could
possibly
be
bought
at
bargain
prices
outside
yet
the
prices
were
higher
even
than
those
that
prevail
in
alaska
for
the
best
merchandise
loud
complaints
are
often
made
against
the
commercial
corporation
which
does
the
great
bulk
of
the
business
in
interior
alaska
yet
if
the
writer
had
to
choose
whether
he
would
be
in
the
hands
of
that
company
or
in
the
hands
of
an
independent
trader
he
would
unhesitatingly
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
company
the
independent
trader
makes
money
sometimes
makes
large
money
and
makes
it
fairly
easily
but
the
calling
seems
to
appeal
mainly
if
not
wholly
to
men
of
low
character
and
no
conscience
there
are
few
things
that
would
redound
more
to
the
benefit
of
the
indian
than
a
great
improvement
in
the
character
of
the
men
with
whom
he
is
compelled
to
do
business
the
wind
had
subsided
by
the
next
morning
and
had
been
of
benefit
rather
than
injury
to
us
for
it
had
blown
the
accumulated
new
snow
off
the
old
trail
so
that
it
was
possible
to
perceive
and
follow
it
but
what
was
our
surprise
to
find
with
the
recollection
of
that
rattling
roof
and
swaying
building
fresh
in
our
minds
that
ten
miles
away
there
had
been
no
wind
at
all
the
snow
lay
undisturbed
on
every
twig
and
bough
from
which
the
gentlest
breeze
would
have
dislodged
it
one
never
ceases
to
wonder
at
what
for
want
of
a
better
word
must
be
called
the
of
much
of
the
weather
in
alaska
though
for
that
matter
in
all
probability
it
is
characteristic
of
weather
in
all
countries
the
habit
of
continual
outdoor
travel
gives
scope
as
well
as
edge
to
observation
of
such
things
which
a
life
in
one
place
denies
that
had
cut
a
clean
swath
across
the
yukon
valley
yet
it
seems
strange
that
so
violent
a
disturbance
could
take
place
without
affecting
and
to
some
extent
agitating
the
atmosphere
for
many
miles
adjacent
sidenote
snow
glasses
so
sometimes
in
sometimes
in
wind
always
on
and
often
hard
put
to
it
to
find
and
follow
the
trail
at
all
we
struggled
on
for
two
or
three
days
more
sleeping
one
night
at
a
hut
another
in
a
telegraph
cabin
crowded
with
infantrymen
sent
out
to
repair
the
extensive
damage
of
the
recent
storm
and
none
too
pleased
at
the
detail
we
plodded
our
weary
way
up
that
interminable
river
at
last
we
met
the
that
person
on
the
alaskan
trail
and
his
track
greatly
lightened
our
labour
by
his
permission
we
broke
into
his
padlocked
cabin
that
night
by
the
skilful
application
of
an
to
a
link
of
the
chain
and
were
more
comfortable
than
we
had
been
for
some
time
past
the
mouth
of
the
koyukuk
past
grimcop
past
lowden
past
melozikaket
to
kokrine
and
mouse
point
we
plugged
along
making
miles
one
day
and
thirty
another
and
then
dropping
again
to
eighteen
the
temperature
dropped
to
zero
and
a
keen
wind
made
it
necessary
to
keep
the
nose
continually
covered
at
this
time
of
year
the
covering
of
the
nose
involves
a
fresh
annoyance
for
it
deflects
the
breath
upward
and
the
moisture
of
it
continually
condenses
on
the
snow
glasses
which
means
continual
wiping
a
stick
of
some
sort
of
waxy
compound
to
be
rubbed
upon
the
glass
bought
in
new
york
as
a
preventive
of
the
deposit
of
moisture
proved
entirely
useless
in
this
respect
the
esquimau
snow
goggle
which
is
simply
a
piece
of
wood
hollowed
out
into
a
cup
and
illuminated
by
narrow
slits
has
advantage
over
any
shape
or
kind
of
glass
protection
a
french
metal
device
of
the
same
order
that
is
advertised
in
the
dealer
catalogues
was
found
to
fail
perhaps
owing
to
a
wrong
optical
arrangement
of
the
slits
it
caused
an
that
brought
on
headache
but
if
that
principle
could
be
scientifically
worked
out
and
such
a
device
perfected
it
would
be
a
boon
to
the
traveller
over
snow
for
it
would
do
away
with
glass
altogether
with
its
two
chief
objections
its
fragility
and
its
opacity
when
covered
with
vapour
sidenote
the
indispensability
of
some
eye
protection
when
travelling
in
the
late
winter
and
the
serious
consequences
that
follow
its
neglect
were
once
again
demonstrated
at
mouse
point
the
was
crowded
with
busted
stampeders
coming
out
of
the
nowikaket
country
there
had
been
a
report
of
a
rich
strike
on
a
creek
of
the
nowitna
late
the
previous
fall
and
a
number
of
men
from
other
camps
some
from
as
far
as
nome
had
gone
in
there
with
outfits
for
the
winter
the
stampede
had
been
a
failure
no
gold
was
found
there
was
much
indignant
assertion
that
no
gold
ever
been
found
and
that
the
reported
strike
was
a
fake
though
to
what
end
or
profit
such
a
fake
stampede
should
be
caused
unless
by
some
neighbouring
trader
it
is
hard
to
understand
and
here
were
the
stampeders
streaming
out
again
a
ragged
unkempt
crowd
in
every
variety
of
arctic
toggery
many
of
them
suffering
from
acute
it
is
surprising
that
even
will
go
out
in
the
hills
for
the
whole
winter
without
providing
themselves
with
protection
against
the
glare
of
the
sun
which
they
know
will
inevitably
assail
their
eyes
before
the
spring
yet
so
it
is
and
this
lack
of
forethought
is
not
confined
to
the
matter
of
snow
glasses
the
first
half
dozen
men
we
received
in
saint
hospital
at
fairbanks
suffering
from
severely
frozen
feet
were
all
grown
careless
father
ragarou
another
jesuit
priest
of
another
type
reached
the
from
the
opposite
direction
about
the
same
time
we
did
and
i
was
interested
in
watching
his
treatment
of
the
inflamed
eyes
upon
a
disk
of
lead
he
folded
a
little
piece
of
cotton
cloth
in
the
shape
of
a
tent
and
setting
fire
to
it
allowed
it
to
burn
out
completely
then
with
a
wet
brush
he
gathered
up
the
slight
yellow
residuum
of
the
combustion
and
painted
it
over
the
eyes
holding
the
lids
open
with
thumb
and
finger
and
drawing
the
brush
through
and
through
an
incredulous
spectator
noticing
the
sacred
monogram
neatly
stamped
upon
the
disk
of
lead
made
some
sneering
remark
to
me
about
romish
superstition
but
remembering
the
jesuit
bark
and
recalling
that
i
had
in
my
at
that
moment
a
letter
i
had
brought
all
the
way
from
the
koyukuk
addressed
to
this
very
priest
begging
for
a
further
supply
of
a
pile
ointment
that
had
proved
efficacious
i
held
my
peace
whether
it
be
an
oxide
or
a
carbonate
or
some
salt
that
is
formed
by
the
combustion
i
am
not
chemist
enough
to
know
but
i
saw
man
after
man
relieved
by
this
application
even
the
scoffer
was
convinced
there
was
merit
in
the
treatment
though
stoutly
protesting
that
them
letters
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
which
nobody
took
the
trouble
to
argue
with
him
my
own
custom
we
are
all
of
us
doctors
of
a
sort
in
this
country
is
to
instil
a
few
drops
of
a
solution
of
cocaine
which
gives
immediate
temporary
relief
and
then
apply
frequent
washes
of
boric
acid
bandaging
up
the
eyes
completely
in
bad
cases
by
cloths
kept
wet
with
the
solution
but
i
do
not
know
that
it
brings
better
result
than
the
lead
treatment
certainly
it
is
a
matter
in
which
an
ounce
of
any
sort
of
prevention
is
better
than
a
pound
of
any
sort
of
cure
the
affection
is
a
serious
one
being
nothing
more
or
less
than
acute
ophthalmia
the
pain
is
very
severe
and
repeated
attacks
are
said
to
bring
permanent
weakness
of
the
eyes
smoked
glasses
or
goggles
a
veils
of
green
or
blue
or
black
even
a
crescent
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
or
cardboard
and
blackened
on
its
with
charcoal
will
prevent
the
hours
and
sometimes
days
of
torture
which
this
distemper
entails
sidenote
horses
and
mules
for
a
few
miles
we
had
the
trail
of
the
stampeders
but
when
that
crossed
the
river
we
put
on
our
and
settled
to
the
steady
grind
once
more
a
day
mush
brought
us
to
the
birches
and
another
to
gold
mountain
between
the
two
places
there
was
a
portage
and
the
trail
thereon
protected
by
the
timber
was
good
we
longed
for
the
time
when
all
trails
in
alaska
shall
be
taken
off
the
rivers
and
cut
in
the
protecting
forest
but
we
had
gone
but
a
mile
along
this
good
trail
when
our
hearts
sank
for
we
saw
ahead
of
us
a
procession
of
army
mules
packing
supplies
from
fort
gibbon
to
the
telegraph
repair
parties
we
pulled
out
into
the
snow
that
the
mules
might
pass
and
the
soldiers
said
no
word
for
they
knew
just
how
we
felt
until
the
last
soldier
leading
the
last
mule
was
going
by
and
he
turned
round
and
said
and
her
name
was
maud
it
was
in
the
height
of
opper
popularity
his
comic
supplements
the
chief
dependence
of
the
for
the
reference
was
so
apposite
that
we
burst
into
laughter
but
there
was
nothing
funny
about
the
devastation
that
had
been
wrought
that
good
trail
was
all
gone
the
bottom
pounded
out
of
it
and
nothing
was
left
but
a
ploughed
lane
punched
full
of
we
had
no
trouble
following
the
trail
on
the
river
after
this
encounter
but
it
had
been
almost
as
easy
going
to
have
struck
out
for
ourselves
in
the
unbroken
snow
of
the
winter
it
is
hard
to
make
outsiders
understand
how
a
man
who
loves
all
animals
may
come
to
hate
horses
and
mules
particularly
mules
in
this
country
our
travelling
is
above
all
a
matter
of
surface
distance
counts
and
weather
counts
but
surface
counts
for
more
than
either
see
how
fast
we
came
across
the
seward
peninsula
in
the
most
distressing
weather
imaginable
a
dog
trail
becomes
so
hard
and
smooth
that
it
offers
scarce
any
resistance
to
the
passage
of
the
sled
and
for
walking
or
running
over
in
moccasins
or
mukluks
is
the
most
perfect
surface
imaginable
the
more
it
is
used
the
better
it
becomes
but
put
a
horse
on
that
trail
and
in
one
passage
it
is
ruined
the
hoofs
break
through
the
crust
at
every
step
and
throw
up
the
broken
pieces
as
they
are
withdrawn
with
mules
it
is
even
worse
the
holes
they
punch
are
deeper
and
sharper
neither
man
nor
dog
can
pass
over
it
again
in
comfort
one
slips
and
slides
about
at
every
step
the
leg
leaders
and
ankle
sinews
are
strained
the
soles
of
the
feet
though
hardened
by
a
thousand
miles
in
moccasins
become
sore
and
inflamed
and
at
night
there
is
a
new
sort
of
weariness
that
only
a
trail
gives
as
a
rule
the
dog
trail
is
of
so
little
service
to
the
horse
or
mule
that
it
were
as
cheap
to
break
out
a
new
one
in
the
snow
and
it
is
this
knowledge
that
exasperates
the
dog
musher
so
there
is
not
much
love
lost
between
the
horse
man
and
the
dog
man
in
alaska
sidenote
army
posts
and
natives
at
last
after
a
night
at
old
station
we
came
in
sight
of
tanana
where
is
fort
gibbon
the
one
the
name
of
the
town
and
the
the
other
the
name
of
the
military
post
and
the
telegraph
office
the
military
authorities
refuse
to
call
their
post
fort
tanana
and
the
postal
authorities
refuse
to
allow
the
town
to
be
called
fort
gibbon
so
there
they
lie
cheek
by
jowl
two
separate
places
with
a
fence
between
them
a
source
of
endless
confusion
a
letter
addressed
to
fort
gibbon
is
likely
to
go
astray
and
a
telegram
addressed
to
tanana
to
be
refused
stretching
along
a
mile
and
a
half
of
river
bank
and
beginning
to
come
into
view
ten
miles
before
they
are
reached
the
military
and
commercial
structures
gradually
separate
themselves
here
to
the
left
are
the
ugly
frame
buildings
all
painted
yellow
barracks
canteen
officers
quarters
hospital
commissariat
and
so
on
two
clumsy
give
height
without
dignity
a
quality
denied
to
military
architecture
in
alaska
to
the
right
the
town
begins
and
an
irregular
row
of
one
and
two
story
buildings
stores
warehouses
drinking
shops
straggle
along
the
unlike
most
towns
in
interior
alaska
tanana
does
not
depend
upon
an
adjacent
mining
camp
it
owes
its
existence
first
to
its
geographical
position
as
the
central
point
of
interior
alaska
at
the
confluence
of
the
tanana
and
yukon
rivers
most
of
the
freight
and
passenger
traffic
for
fairbanks
and
the
upper
river
is
transshipped
at
tanana
and
extensive
stocks
of
merchandise
are
maintained
there
the
army
post
is
the
other
important
factor
in
the
town
prosperity
and
is
especially
accountable
for
the
number
of
saloons
not
only
the
soldiers
but
many
civilian
employees
are
supported
by
the
post
and
when
it
is
understood
that
three
thousand
cords
of
wood
are
burned
annually
in
the
military
reservation
it
will
be
seen
that
quite
a
number
of
men
must
find
work
as
choppers
and
haulers
for
the
wood
contractors
setting
aside
the
maintenance
of
the
telegraph
service
which
has
already
been
referred
to
it
may
be
said
without
unfairness
that
the
salient
activities
of
the
army
in
the
interior
of
alaska
are
the
consumption
of
whisky
and
wood
there
is
no
opportunity
for
military
training
for
more
than
six
months
in
the
year
it
is
impossible
to
drill
outdoors
and
the
officers
complain
of
the
retrogression
of
their
men
in
all
soldierly
accomplishments
during
the
two
years
detail
in
alaska
whether
the
prosperity
of
the
liquor
dealer
be
in
any
real
sense
the
prosperity
of
the
country
and
whether
the
rapid
destruction
of
the
forest
be
compensated
for
by
the
wages
paid
to
its
destroyers
may
reasonably
be
doubted
three
miles
away
is
a
considerable
native
village
where
the
mission
of
our
saviour
of
the
episcopal
church
is
situated
with
an
attractive
church
building
and
a
picturesque
graveyard
the
evil
influence
which
the
town
and
the
army
post
have
exerted
upon
the
indians
finds
its
ultimate
expression
in
the
growth
of
the
graveyard
and
the
dwindling
of
the
village
this
point
at
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
was
an
important
place
for
the
inhabitants
of
interior
alaska
ages
before
the
white
man
reached
the
country
tribes
from
all
the
middle
yukon
from
the
lower
yukon
from
the
tanana
from
the
upper
kuskokwim
met
here
for
trading
and
for
general
festivity
it
is
impossible
nowadays
to
determine
when
first
the
white
man
merchandise
began
to
penetrate
into
this
country
but
it
was
long
before
the
white
man
came
himself
such
prized
and
portable
articles
as
axes
and
knives
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
from
tribe

the
stories
that
linger
with
the
village
ancients
of
the
great
numbers
of
indians
who
used
to
inhabit
the
country
are
doubtless
based
upon
recollections
of
the
gathering
at
old
nuchalawóya
when
furs
were
brought
here
from
far
and
wide
when
there
was
no
other
place
of
merchandise
in
now
almost
every
indian
village
has
a
trader
and
a
store
that
the
race
has
diminished
and
in
most
places
is
still
diminishing
is
beyond
question
but
that
it
was
ever
very
largely
numerous
the
natural
conditions
of
the
country
forbid
us
to
believe
sidenote
during
the
reverend
jules
prevost
time
at
tanana
and
he
was
in
residence
in
the
year
of
this
journey
from
careful
vital
statistics
kept
during
two
periods
of
five
years
each
the
race
seemed
barely
to
be
holding
its
own
but
since
that
time
there
has
been
a
considerable
decline
coincident
with
the
increase
of
drunkenness
and
debauchery
at
the
village
when
prevost
firm
hand
and
watchful
eye
were
withdrawn
the
situation
tends
to
grow
worse
and
while
one
does
not
give
up
hope
for
that
would
mean
to
give
up
serious
effort
the
outlook
for
the
indians
at
this
place
seems
unfavourable

hundred

or
eight

the
number
varies
from

to

souls

occupied
by
bootleggers
and
that
is
the
tanana
situation
in
a
nutshell
the
men
desire
the
native
girls
and
the
liquor
is
largely
a
lure
to
get
them
tuberculosis
and
venereal
disease
are
rife
and
the
two
make
a
terribly
fatal
combination
amongst
indians
it
was
good
to
enjoy
and
prevost
hospitality
and
it
was
good
to
speak
through
such
an
admirable
interpreter
as
paul
something
more
than
intelligence
and
knowledge
of
the
languages
are
required
to
make
a
good
interpreter
there
must
be
sympathy
and
the
ability
to
take
fire
with
such
an
interpreter
leaping
at
the
speaker
thoughts
carrying
himself
entirely
into
his
changing
moods
rising
to
vehemence
with
him
and
again
dropping
to
gentleness
forgetting
himself
in
his
identification
with
his
principal
there
is
real
pleasure
in
speaking
to
the
natives
who
hang
upon
his
vicarious
lips
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
most
intelligent
mission
interpreters
in
the
country
is
also
so
phlegmatic
in
disposition
so
lifeless
and
monotonous
in
his
speech
and
particularly
so
impassive
of
countenance
that
he
reminds
one
of
napoleon
saying
about
talleyrand
that
if
some
one
kicked
him
behind
while
he
was
speaking
to
you
his
face
would
give
no
sign
of
it
at
all
sidenote
chena
and
fairbanks
it
is
not
necessary
to
write
much
detail
of
the
journey
to
fairbanks
up
the
tanana
river
the
trail
was
then
wholly
on
the
river
but
now
it
has
been
taken
wholly
off
as

some
day
will
be

the
region
about
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
for
some
miles
up
is
one
of
the
windiest
in
the
country
and
there
is
always
troublesome
crossing
of
bare
and
of

its
close

alike
realise
it
and
push
on
willingly
over
longer
stages
than
they
had
before
attempted
two
days
from
tanana
we
were
luxuriating
in
the
natural
hot
springs
near
baker
creek
wallowing
in
the
crude
wooden
vat
when
daddy
karstner
had
shovelled
enough
snow
in
to
make
entering
the
water
possible
and
emerging
ruddy
as
boiled
lobsters
it
was
a
beautiful
and
interesting
spot
then
with
noble
groves
of
birch
and
the
finest
grove
of
in
alaska
all
cut
down
now
all
ruined
in
a
plunging
and
bounding
and
quite
unsuccessful
attempt
to
make
a
health
resort
of
the
place
for
the
smart
set
of
fairbanks
it
is
a
scurvy
trick
of
fortune
when
she
gives
large
wealth
to
a
man
with
no
feeling
for
trees
we
spent
sunday
there
and
roamed
over
the
curious
domain
amidst
all
the
surrounding
snow
rank
in
vegetation
amidst
the
winter
death
and
then
we
wallowed
again
tolovana
nenana
and
then
one
long
run
of
miles
the
longest
and
last
run
of
the
winter
and
chena
and
fairbanks
but
just
before
we
reached
chena
as
we
passed
the
fish
camp
where
the
dogs
had
been
boarded
the
previous
summer
nanook
stopped
the
whole
team
looked
up
at
the
bank
and
gave
utterance
to
his
pronounced
five
barks
on
the
descending
scale
none
of
the
other
dogs
seemed
to
notice
or
recognise
the
place
but
nanook
said
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
uttered
speech
well
well
there
where
i
spent
last
summer
we
reached
fairbanks
on
the
of
april
in
time
for
good
friday
and
easter
after
an
absence
of
four
months
and
a
half
with
the
accumulated
mail
of
all
that
period
awaiting
me
the
distance
covered
was
about
hundred
miles
three
fourths
of
it
on
foot
more
than
half
of
it
on
at
chena
i
had
called
up
the
hospital
at
fairbanks
on
the
telephone
and
the
exchange
operator
had
immediately
recognised
my
voice
and
bidden
me
welcome
but
when
i
reached
fairbanks
a
light
beard
that
i
had
suffered
to
grow
during
the
winter
made
me
unrecognisable
by
those
who
knew
me
best
so
effectually
does
a
beard
disguise
a
man
and
so
surely
may
his
voice
identify
him

to
excitement
for

is
deep
satisfaction

to
reach
some
remote
band
of
indians
and
preach
to
them

three

of
a
journey
that

in

had
been
the
happy
duty
of
the
writer
to
return
to
the
koyukuk
late
in
the
winter
of
empowered
to
build
the
promised
mission
for
the
hitherto
neglected

of

tent
at

spot
opposite
the
mouth
of

the
aid
of

brought
from

district

the

of
the
indians
the
little
log
church
and
the

were
put
up

should

the

on

all
the

waters
of

alaska
do
not
belong
to
a
narrative
concerned
solely
with
winter
travel
but
her
maiden
voyage
ended
in
an
unexpected
and
rather
extraordinary
journey
over
the
ice
which
is
perhaps
worth
describing
after
the
voyage
down
the
yukon
and
up
and
down
the
tanana
it
was
purposed
to
take
the
boat
up
the
koyukuk
to
the
new
mission
at
the
allakaket
where
dogs
and
gear
had
been
left
and
put
her
in
winter
quarters
there
the
delays
that
associate
themselves
not
unnaturally
with
three
novices
and
a
gasoline
engine
had
brought
the
date
for
ascending
the
koyukuk
a
little
too
late
for
safety
though
still
well
within
the
ordinary
season
of
open
water
the
possibility
of
an
early
winter
closing
the
navigation
of
that
stream
before
the
reached
her
destination
had
been
entertained
and
provided
against
though
it
seemed
remote
three
dogs
needed
anyway
to
replace
superannuated
members
of
the
team
had
been
bargained
for
at
tanana
and
accommodations
for
them
arranged
and
a
supply
of
dog
fish
stowed
on
the
after
deck
of
the
launch
but
when
we
went
to
pay
the
arranged
price
and
receive
the
dogs
the
vender
wife
and
children
set
up
such
a
remonstrance
and
plaintive
that
he
went
back
on
his
bargain
and
we
did
not
get
the
dogs
there
was
no
time
to
hunt
others
to
linger
was
to
invite
the
very
mishap
we
sought
to
guard
against
so
we
pulled
out
dogless
reached
the
mouth
of
the
koyukuk
on
the
of
september
and
having
taken
on
board
the
supply
of
gasoline
cached
there
turned
our
bow
up
the
river
the
next
morning
for
five
days
we
pushed
up
the
waters
of
that
great
lonely
river
and
by
that
time
we
were
some
miles
above
hogatzakaket
three
hundred
and
miles
from
the
mouth
and
one
hundred
and
miles
from
the
mission
at
the
camp
of
a
prospector
who
had
recently
poled
up
from
the
yukon
we
woke
on
board
the
launch
the
next
morning
to
find
ice
formed
all
around
us
and
ice
running
in
the
river
the
thermometer
had
gone
to
zero
in
the
night
sidenote
the
running
ice
a
very
brief
attempt
to
make
our
way
against
the
running
ice
showed
the
danger
of
doing
so
for
the
thin
cakes
had
and
cut
the
planking
of
the
boat
so
that
she
began
to
leak
then
there
came
to
me
with
some
bitterness
that
i
had
earnestly
desired
a
thin
steel
at
the
but
had
allowed
myself
to
be
persuaded
out
of
it
by
her
builders
so
again
my
forethought
had
been
of
no
avail
though
of
course
lightness
of
draught
the
first
consideration
we
put
back
to
the
camp
and
proceeded
to
flatten
out
and
cut
up
all
the
empty
cans
and
tinware
we
could
find
and
nail
it
along
the
of
the
boat
but
the
prospector
persuaded
us
to
wait
a
day
or
two
he
had
never
seen
a
river
close
with
the
first
little
run
of
ice
he
looked
for
a
soft
spell
and
open
water
yet
it
was
foolish
to
risk
the
boat
against
the
ice
so
we
waited
and
night
after
night
the
thermometer
fell
a
little
lower
and
a
little
lower
until
presently
a
sheet
of
ice
stretched
across
the
whole
river
in
the
bend
where
we
lay
we
were
frozen
in
the
remote
possibility
we
had
feared
and
sought
to
guard
against
had
happened
navigation
had
ceased
on
the
koyukuk
at
the
earliest
date
anybody
remembered
the
of
september
three
days
more
had
surely
taken
us
to
the
mission
where
they
had
long
expected
us
now
we
should
have
to
make
our
way
on
foot
without
dogs
on
the
dangerous
first
ice
as
it
is
called
taking
all
sorts
of
chances
pulling
a
yukon
sled
with
tent
and
stove
grub
and
bedding
by
the
back
of
the
face
but
first
there
was
the
launch
to
pull
out
and
make
snug
for
the
winter
and
safe
against
the
spring
a
convenient
little
creek
mouth
with
easy
grade
offered
which
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
had
not
pushed
on
the
few
more
miles
we
could
have
made
here
were
eligible
winter
quarters
farther
on
we
might
have
trouble
in
putting
the
boat
in
safety
here
also
was
a
kindly
and
capable
man
willing
to
assist
us
it
was
our
great
good
fortune
to
find
this
man
at
this
spot
a
steamboat
he
had
signalled
as
she
entered
the
mouth
of
the
koyukuk
had
passed
him
by
unheeded
and
he
had
been
left
to
make
his
way
six
hundred
miles
up
to
the
diggings
with
his
winter
outfit
in
a
poling
boat
he
had
accomplished
more
than
half
the
task
and
warned
by
the
approach
of
winter
had
stopped
at
this
place
a
few
days
before
we
reached
it
and
had
begun
the
building
of
a
little
cabin
meaning
to
prospect
the
creek
which
had
taken
his
eye
as
having
a
promising
look
the
cabin
we
helped
him
finish
was
the
cabin
he
had
built
in
alaska
he
informed
us
there
is
something
very
impressive
about
the
quiet
unrecorded
hardihood
of
the
class
of
which
this
man
was
an
excellent
type
we
asked
him
why
he
had
no
partner
and
he
said
he
had
had
several
partners
but
they
all
snored
and
he
would
not
live
with
a
man
that
snored
he
had
prospected
and
mined
in
many
districts
of
alaska
during
nearly
twenty
years
once
he
had
sold
a
claim
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
that
had
yielded
many
thousands
to
the
purchaser
and
that
was
as
near
wealth
as
he
had
ever
come
but
he
had
always
made
a
living
always
had
enough
money
at
the
close
of
the
summer
to
buy
his
winter
outfit
and
try
his
luck
somewhere
else
sidenote
the
prospector
singly
or
in
pairs
men
of
this
type
have
wandered
all
over
this
vast
country
preceding
the
government
surveys
preceding
the
professional
explorer
settling
down
for
a
winter
on
some
creek
that
caught
their
fancy
building
a
cabin

holes

the
more
one
admiration
grows
for
the
silent
strong
men
who
have
gone
out
all
over
this
land
and
pitted
themselves
successfully
against
its
savage
wildness
often
in
stress
for
the
necessaries
of
life
there
are
yet
no
men
as
a
class
more
and
generous
trained
to
do
everything
for
themselves
there
are
none
more
willing
to
help
others
it
is
no
small
task
to
pull
a
boat
out
of
the
water
with
only
such
wilderness
tackle
as
we
could
devise
we
made
ways
of
soft
timbers
squaring
and
smoothing
them
we
cut
down
many
trees
for
rollers
we
dug
and
graded
the
beach
then
having
altogether
unloaded
her
and
built
a
high
cache
of
poles
and
a
platform
for
her
stuff
and
having
chopped
the
ice
from
all
around
her
we
rigged
a
spanish
windlass
and
wound
that
boat
out
of
the
water
with
the
cable
she
carried
and
up
on
the
ways
and
well
into
the
mouth
of
the
little
creek
then
we
levelled
her
up
and
thoroughly
braced
her
and
put
her
canvas
cover
all
over
her
and
she
lay
there
until
spring
and
took
no
harm
at
all
arthur
had
meantime
been
making
a
sled
of
birch
intending
to
pull
it
himself
while
the
doctor
and
i
pulled
a
yukon
sled
borrowed
from
our
friend
the
prospector
by
the
of
october
all
our
dispositions
were
made
for
departure
and
the
ice
seemed
strong
enough
to
warrant
trusting
ourselves
to
it
but
we
waited
another
two
days
the
thermometer
still
reaching
a
minimum
each
night
somewhere
around
zero
when
we
said
to
our
friend
martin
nelson
sometimes
one
wonders
if
anywhere
else
in
the
world
can
be
found
men
as
kind
and
helpful
to
strangers
and
started
on
our
journey
it
soon
appeared
that
arthur
sled
was
more
hindrance
than
help
there
was
no
material
to
iron
the
runners
save
strips
of
tin
can
and
these
could
not
be
beaten
so
smooth
that
they
did
not
drag
and
cut
on
the
ice
so
the
load
was
transferred
to
our
sled
and
the
little
sled
abandoned
and
we
took
turns
at
the
harness
this
was
the
order
of
the
journey
one
man
went
ahead
with
an
axe
to
test
the
ice
one
man
put
the
rope
trace
about
his
shoulders
one
man
pushed
at
the
which
had
been
affixed
to
the
sled
it
was
fortunate
that
amidst
the
equipment
on
the
launch
were
two
pairs
of
without
them
any
sort
of
pulling
and
pushing
on
the
glare
ice
would
have
been
impossible
we
soon
found
that
the
bend
in
which
we
had
frozen
was
no
sort
of
index
of
the
general
condition
of
the
river
much
of
it
was
still
wide
open
and
every
elbow
between
bends
was
piled
high
with
rough
ice
from
pressure
jams
there
was
shore
ice
however
even
in
the
open
bends
along
which
we
were
able
to
creep
and
though
the
gave
considerable
trouble
yet
we
did
very
well
the
first
day
and
camped
at
dark
with
eighteen
or
nineteen
miles
to
our
credit
in
the
presence
of
a
great
red
smoky
sunset
and
a
glorious
alpenglow
on
a
distant
snow
mountain
the
next
day
was
full
of
risks
and
difficulties
we
were
to
learn
more
about
the
varieties
and
vagaries
of
ice
on
that
journey
than
many
winters
travel
on
older
ice
would
teach
illustration
the
start
over
the
first
ice
illustration
rough
going
sidenote
the
start
at
times
for
a
few
hundred
yards
the
sled
would
glide
with
little
effort
over
smooth
polished
ice
then
would
come
a
long
the
side
of
which
we
had
to
hug
close
and
the
ice
upon
it
was
what
is
called
through
several
layers
of
which
we
broke
at
every
step
as
the
river
fell
each
night
had
left
a
thin
sheet
of
ice
underneath
the
preceding
night
ice
and
the
foot
crashed
through
the
layers
and
the
sled
runners
cut
through
them
down
to
the
gravel
and
sand
at
the
bottom
then
would
come
another
smooth
stretch
on
which
we
made
good
time
but
as
we
advanced
up
the
river
the
current
was
swifter
and
swifter
and
the
ice
conditions
grew
steadily
worse
here
was
a
bank
with
just
about
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
of
ice
adhering
to
it
and
the
black
rushing
water
beyond
we
must
either
get
our
load
along
that
shelf
or
unload
the
sled
and
pack
everything
over
the
face
of
a
rocky
bluff
arthur
passed
over
it
first
testing
gently
with
the
axe
and
found
it
none
too
strong
but
the
alternative
was
so
toilsome
that
we
resolved
to
take
the
chance
the
doctor
put
the
trace
over
his
shoulders
arthur
took
the
while
i
climbed
to
a
ledge
of
the
rocks
and
with
a
rope
made
of
a
pair
of
puttees
unwound
for
the
purpose
and
fastened
to
the
sled
took
all
the
weight
i
could
and
eased
the
sled
over
the
worst
place
where
the
ice
sloped
to
the
water
if
the
ice
had
broken
i
might
have
held
the
sled
from
sinking
until
one
of
the
others
came
to
me
or
i
might
not
the
boys
would
probably
have
gone
in
too
it
was
a
most
risky
spot
and
the
sort
of
chance
no
one
would
think
of
taking
under
ordinary
circumstances
as
it
was
the
ice
broke
under
arthur
feet
and
only
by
throwing
his
weight
on
the
sled
did
he
save
himself
a
ducking
but
we
got
the
load
safely
across
a
good
run
of
perhaps
a
mile
and
then
we
had
to
go
back
at
least
half
a
mile
for
the
ice
played
out
altogether
on
our
side
of
the
river
as
we
reached
the
batzakaket
and
there
was
open
water
in
the
middle
to
reach
the
shore
ice
that
was
continuous
on
the
other
side
we
had
to
double
the
open
water
with
such
varying
fortune
the
day
passed
and
we
camped
on
the
level
ice
of
a
little
creek
tributary
to
the
right
bank
having
made
perhaps
another
nineteen
miles
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
my
heart
sank
at
the
tiny
creeping
patter
of
fine
snow
on
the
silk
tent
snow
was
one
thing
i
greatly
dreaded
for
there
was
not
a
pair
of
amongst
us
a
little
snow
would
not
do
much
harm
but
if
once
snow
began
to
fall
we
might
have
a
foot
or
two
before
it
ceased
and
then
we
should
be
in
bad
case
it
stopped
before
noon
but
the
that
fell
made
the
sled
drag
much
heavier
the
actual
force
to
be
exerted
was
not
the
most
laborious
feature
of
pulling
that
sled
it
was
the
jerk
jerk
jerk
on
the
shoulders
a
dog
four
legs
give
him
much
smoother
traction
than
a
man
two
legs
give
just
as
a
engine
will
turn
a
propeller
with
much
less
vibration
than
a
engine
every
step
forward
gave
an
impulse
that
spent
itself
before
the
next
impulse
was
given
and
the
result
was
that
the
shoulders
grew
sore
we
came
that
morning
to
the
longest
and
roughest
we
had
so
far
encountered
it
was
as
though
a
thousand
bulls
had
been
turned
loose
in
a
mammoth
warehouse
jagged
slabs
of
ice
upended
everywhere
in
the
most
riotous
confusion
and
it
was
impossible
to
pick
any
way
amongst
them
so
a
man
had
to
go
ahead
and
hew
a
path
it
was
while
thus
engaged
that
the
doctor
fell
and
injured
his
knee
so
severely
on
a
sharp
ice
point
that
he
hobbled
in
pain
the
rest
of
the
trip
this
was
a
very
serious
matter
to
us
for
though
he
insisted
on
still
taking
his
trick
at
the
traces
his
effectiveness
as
a
motive
power
was
much
diminished
and
we
had
no
sooner
thus
hewed
and
smashed
our
way
through
that
jam
than
we
had
to
hew
and
smash
it
across
to
the
other
side
again
in
our
search
for
passage
sidenote
by
the
back
of
the
face
then
we
came
to
a
place
where
in
order
to
cut
off
a
long
sweeping
curve
of
the
river
with
open
water
and
bad
shore
ice
we
went
through
a
dry
slough
and
had
to
drag
those
iron
runners
over
gravel
and
stones
where
sometimes
it
was
all
the
three
of
us
could
do
to
move
the
sled
a
few
feet
at
a
time
yet
all
along
the
banks
were
willows
and
if
we
had
only
known
then
what
we
know
now
we
would
have
cut
down
and
split
some
saplings
and
bound
them
over
the
iron
and
so
have
saved
three
fourths
of
that
labour
sidenote
bear
meat
and
beans
so
the
day
run
was
short
though
the
most
exhausting
yet
and
we
were
all
thoroughly
tired
out
when
we
pitched
the
tent
i
have
note
of
a
great
supper
of
bear
meat
and
beans
the
meat
the
spoil
of
our
friend
the
prospector
gun
it
is
one
of
the
compensations
of
human
nature
that
the
satisfaction
of
appetite
increases
in
pleasure
in
proportion
to
the
bodily
labour
that
is
done
with
food
abundant
and
at
choice
i
do
not
like
bear
meat
and
will
not
eat
beans
yet
my
diary
bears
special
note
of
the
delicious
meal
they
furnished
on
this
occasion
put
any
philosopher
in
the
traces
or
set
him
ahead
of
the
dog
team
on
breaking
trail
all
day
and
towards
evening
it
is
odds
that
his
mind
is
not
occupied
with
deep
speculations
about
the
infinite
and
the
absolute
but
rather
with
the
question
of
what
he
will
have
for
supper
particularly
should
the
grub
be
a
little
short
should
fresh
meat
give
out
or
above
all
should
sugar
be
shy
it
is
astonishing
how
one
mind
runs
on
eating
and
what
elaborate
imaginary
repasts
one
partakes
of
yet
of
all
food
that
a
man
ever
eats
there
is
none
that
is
so
relished
and
gives
such
clear
gustatory
pleasure
as
the
plain
rough
fare
of
the
camp
provided
it
be
well
cooked
greatly
as
we
were
in
need
of
sleep
we
got
little
for
the
doctor
knee
pained
him
all
night
and
poor
arthur
developed
a
raging
toothache
that
did
not
yield
until
carbolic
acid
had
been
thrice
applied
soon
after
we
started
the
next
day
the
river
narrowed
and
swept
round
a
series
of
mountain
bluffs
and
we
began
to
have
the
gloomiest
expectations
of
trouble
it
seemed
certain
that
ice
would
fail
us
for
passage
and
we
would
have
to
pack
our
sled
and
its
load
by
slow
relays
over
the
mountain
but
to
our
delight
we
passed
between
the
bluffs
on
good
firm
smooth
ice
and
it
was
not
until
we
emerged
on
the
flat
beyond
that
our
difficulty
began
so
it
is
again
and
again
on
the
trail
almost
always
it
is
the
unexpected
that
happens
almost
always
it
is
something
quite
different
from
what
our
apprehensions
have
dwelt
upon
that
arises
to
hinder
and
distress
us
a
tongue
of
level
land
that
struck
far
out
into
the
water
a
cut
mud
bank
with
a
current
so
swift
that
no
ice
at
all
had
formed
along
it
interposed
an
obstacle
that
it
took
hours
to
circumvent
we
had
to
leave
the
sled
and
cut
a
trail
through
the
brush
for
half
a
mile
along
this
peninsula
in
order
to
reach
a
stretch
of
the
river
where
the
ice
was
resumed
and
the
little
snow
that
had
fallen
being
quite
insufficient
to
give
the
sled
good
passage
we
had
an
exceedingly
arduous
job
in
getting
it
across
a
mile
or
two
of
good
going
brought
us
in
view
of
the
smoke
of
a
human
habitation
what
a
blessed
sight
often
and
often
this
waving
column
of
blue
smoke
in
the
distance
is
sometimes
it
means
life
itself
to
the
alaskan
musher
and
it
always
means
warmth
shelter
food
companionship
assistance
all
that
one
human
being
can
bring
to
another
the
bright
and
the
balmy
effulgence
of
morn
never
breaks
on
the
traveller
faint
and
astray
with
half
the
rejoicing
that
comes
with
the
first
sight
of
mere
smoke
i
believe
i
see
smoke
cried
arthur
with
the
quick
vision
of
the
native
where
where
we
eagerly
inquired
and
the
doctor
left
the
and
limped
forward
to
the
boy
ahead
with
the
axe
away
yonder
on
that
bank
pointed
arthur
i
see
it
i
see
it
the
doctor
shouted
we
coming
to
a
house
coming
to
people
the
trip
was
a
severe
apprenticeship
to
alaskan
life
for
a
man
straight
from
the
new
york
hospitals
although
before
the
accident
to
his
knee
i
had
declared
that
if
only
they
could
be
trained
to
live
on
dry
fish
i
thought
a
team
of
young
doctors
would
haul
a
sled
very
well
he
was
delighted
at
coming
upon
the
first
inhabited
house
we
had
seen
since
we
helped
nelson
to
build
his
little
cabin
and
was
only
the
second
inhabited
house
in
three
hundred
miles
sidenote
breaking
through
but
perhaps
because
we
grew
less
cautious
in
our
excitement
almost
immediately
after
we
had
spied
the
smoke
of
the
cabin
we
got
into
one
of
the
worst
messes
of
the
whole
trip
arthur
had
pushed
ahead
and
we
had
followed
with
a
spurt
and
almost
at
the
same
time
all
three
of
us
became
aware
that
we
were
on
dangerous
ice
arthur
cried
the
ice
is
breaking
go
back
just
as
we
began
to
feel
it
swaying
under
our
feet
i
shouted
to
the
doctor
go
to
the
bank
quick
and
pushed
with
all
my
might
and
we
managed
to
make
a
few
yards
more
towards
shallow
water
over
ice
that
bent
and
cracked
at
every
step
before
it
gave
way
and
let
down
the
sled
and
the
men
into
two
feet
of
water
arthur
had
run
safely
over
the
breaking
ice
and
had
gained
the
bank
and
as
i
write
in
my
mind
eye
i
can
see
the
doctor
who
had
been
duly
instructed
in
the
elementary
lessons
of
the
trail
standing
in
the
water
and
calling
to
arthur
make
a
fire
quick
make
a
fire
i
all
wet
but
it
was
not
necessary
to
make
a
fire
for
the
thermometer
was
no
lower
than
or
above
zero
and
the
chief
trouble
was
not
the
wetting
of
our
legs
but
the
wetting
of
the
contents
of
the
sled
along
the
bank
was
stronger
ice
and
we
managed
though
not
without
much
difficulty
to
get
the
sled
upon
it
and
to
make
our
way
to
the
indian
cabin
as
soon
as
old
atler
i
have
never
been
quite
sure
of
what
white
man
name
that
is
a
corruption
knew
who
we
were
his
hospitality
which
had
been
ready
enough
at
first
sight
became
most
cordial
and
expansive
while
we
pulled
off
our
wet
clothing
his
wife
hung
it
up
to
dry
and
had
the
kettle
on
and
some
tea
making
and
he
and
arthur
got
out
our
wet
bedding
and
festooned
it
about
the
cabin
most
fortunately
the
things
that
would
have
suffered
most
from
water
did
not
get
wet
so
there
we
lay
all
the
afternoon
having
made
no
more
than
six
miles
and
there
we
lay
all
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
there
was
a
sort
of
awful
interest
that
centred
upon
one
member
of
this
family
a
boy
of
seven
or
eight
years
the
previous
spring
he
had
killed
his
uncle
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
a
rifle
shooting
him
through
the
heart
the
gun
had
been
brought
in
loaded
and
cocked
and
had
been
set
in
a
corner
of
the
cabin
and
the
child
playing
with
it
had
pulled
the
trigger
the
carelessness
of
indians
with
firearms
is
the
frequent
cause
of
terrible
accidents
like
this
the
child
was
still
too
young
to
realise
what
he
had
done
but
one
fancies
that
later
it
will
throw
a
gloom
on
his
life
to
my
great
relief
and
satisfaction
i
was
able
to
arrange
here
for
a
young
indian
man
to
accompany
us
with
his
one
dog
he
was
a
native
of
those
parts
and
knew
every
bend
and
turn
of
the
river
we
were
indeed
in
great
need
of
help
the
doctor
knee
grew
worse
rather
than
better
and
arthur
was
suffering
the
return
of
an
old
rheumatism
in
his
leg
i
was
the
only
sound
member
of
the
party
and
my
shoulders
were
galled
by
the
rope
and
my
feet
tender
and
sore
from
continual
wearing
of
the
crampons
we
were
now
not
quite
some
sixty
miles
lay
behind
us
and
before
and
we
had
been
travelling
four
days
sidenote
william
divine
service
being
done
on
sunday
morning
the
whole
of
it
well
interpreted
by
arthur
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
indians
he
and
william
our
recruit
started
out
to
survey
route
in
this
reconnaissance
william
broke
through
some
slush
ice
at
the
greatest
depth
of
the
river
in
seeking
a
safe
place
to
cross
and
had
arthur
not
been
with
him
would
almost
certainly
have
drowned
for
the
current
was
very
swift
and
the
man
like
most
indians
unable
to
swim
a
stroke
though
indeed
swimming
is
of
little
avail
for
escape
out
of
such
predicament
and
is
a
poor
dependence
in
these
icy
waters
winter
or
summer
more
beans
boiled
and
a
batch
of
biscuits
baked
against
our
departure
and
evening
prayer
said
and
interpreted
we
were
ready
for
bed
again
our
visit
was
a
great
delight
to
old
atler
an
inflamed
eye
was
much
relieved
by
the
doctor
ministrations
and
the
natural
piety
which
he
shares
with
most
indians
was
gratified
at
the
opportunity
of
worship
and
instruction
a
good
old
man
according
to
his
lights
i
take
atler
to
be
well
known
for
benevolence
of
disposition
and
particularly
priding
himself
on
being
a
friend
of
the
white
man
he
told
us
of
one
unworthy
representative
of
that
race
he
had
helped
a
year
ago
the
man
had
come
out
of
the
hogatzitna
hog
river
country
entirely
out
of
food
himself
and
a
couple
of
dogs
nigh
to
starvation
and
atler
had
taken
care
of
him
for
several
days
while
he
recuperated
and
had
given
him
grub
and
dog
fish
enough
to
get
him
to
bettles
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
away
where
he
could
purchase
supplies
the
old
indian
had
robbed
his
own
family
little
winter
stock
of
grub
that
this
stranger
might
be
provided
and
had
never
heard
a
word
from
him
since
though
he
had
promised
to
make
return
when
he
reached
bettles
unfortunately
alaska
white
population
is
sprinkled
with
men
like
this
men
without
heart
and
without
conscience
and
it
is
precisely
such
rascals
who
are
loudest
in
their
contemptuous
talk
of
the
indians
it
is
such
men
who
chop
down
the
woodwork
of
cabins
rather
than
be
troubled
to
take
the
axe
into
the
forest
a
few
rods
away
who
depart
in
the
morning
without
making
kindling
and
shavings
careless
how
other
travellers
may
fare
so
themselves
be
warm
without
labour
who
make
easy
money
in
the
by
dropping
down
the
yukon
with
a
of
whisky
leaving
drunkenness
and
riot
at
every
village
they
pass
who
beget
children
of
the
native
women
and
regard
them
no
more
than
a
dog
does
his
pups
indifferent
that
their
own
flesh
and
blood
go
cold
and
hungry
they
are
the
curse
and
disgrace
of
alaska
and
they
often
go
long
time
insolent
and
unwhipped
because
our
poor
lame
law
is
not
nimble
enough
to
overtake
them
to
whom
is
reserved
the
blackness
of
darkness
for
ever
one
indignation
is
sometimes
disposed
to
thunder
savagely
with
saint
jude
and
indeed
there
needs
a
future
punishment
to
redress
the
balance
in
this
country
sidenote
fido
at
break
of
day
our
reinforced
company
was
off
arthur
and
william
going
ahead
to
sound
the
ice
and
pick
the
way
the
dog
fido
such
a
name
for
a
siwash
dog
and
myself
in
the
traces
the
doctor
at
the
the
rest
had
benefited
the
doctor
knee
but
walking
was
still
painful
and
he
needed
the
support
of
the
all
day
what
a
great
difference
that
one
strong
willing
little
dog
made
his
steady
pulling
kept
the
sled
in
motion
and
relieved
one
shoulders
of
the
galling
jerk
of
the
rope
at
every
step
the
going
was
not
too
bad
as
they
say
here
all
day
though
it
carried
one
rather
severe
disappointment
william
had
told
us
of
a
portage
he
thought
we
could
take
that
would
cut
off
eight
or
nine
miles
of
the
river
but
when
we
reached
it
the
snow
upon
it
proved
insufficient
to
afford
a
passage
for
it
was
a
rough
niggerhead
flat
and
we
had
to
swing
around
the
outer
edges
of
the
great
curves
the
river
makes
where
alone
was
ice
with
trouble
and
danger
at
every
crossing
the
decision
as
to
whether
we
should
halt
or
go
forward
as
to
whether
ice
was
safe
or
unsafe
as
to
whether
we
should
cross
the
river
or
stay
where
we
were
every
decision
that
concerned
the
secure
advance
of
the
party
i
put
wholly
upon
william
and
would
not
permit
myself
or
any
other
to
question
his
judgment
or
to
argue
it
with
him
there
was
no
sense
in
this
young
man
knew
the
river
as
none
of
us
did
knew
ice
as
none
of
us
did
and
we
must
put
ourselves
entirely
in
his
hands
the
debate
that
had
become
usual
at
every
doubtful
course
arose
at
the
portage
just
referred
to
but
it
was
at
once
suppressed
by
the
announcement
that
hereafter
no
one
could
have
the
floor
but
william
and
that
when
he
had
spoken
the
matter
was
settled
day
by
day
i
think
we
all
came
to
a
keener
realisation
of
how
very
dangerous
a
journey
we
were
making
it
lay
heavily
on
my
mind
that
i
had
brought
these
two
young
men
whether
by
mishap
or
mismanagement
into
real
peril
of
their
lives
again
and
again
i
blamed
myself
for
the
delays
that
had
deferred
our
start
up
the
koyukuk
again
and
again
i
wished
that
we
had
waited
longer
before
leaving
the
winter
quarters
i
had
even
contemplated
a
week
stay
at
atler
to
give
the
river
a
chance
to
get
into
better
shape
but
unless
there
came
a
very
much
sharper
spell
than
we
had
had
so
far
a
week
would
not
make
much
difference
and
our
grub
began
to
run
short
and
atler
was
none
too
well
supplied
so
it
seemed
best
to
push
on
the
next
day
was
full
of
toil
and
difficulty
there
was
no
good
ice
to
make
fine
time
over
that
day
starting
in
the
grey
dawn
for
mile
after
mile
we
had
to
haul
the
sled
over
crumbly
that
broke
through
to
gravel
and
when
the
was
done
we
came
to
a
new
bend
where
a
rapid
current
washed
a
steep
mud
bank
there
was
just
a
little
shelf
of
ice
but
the
brush
overhung
it
so
that
the
passage
of
the
sled
was
not
possible
william
and
arthur
started
with
the
axes
to
clear
away
the
brush
but
it
seemed
to
me
foolish
to
do
that
unless
the
ledge
held
out
and
led
somewhere
for
the
turn
of
the
bank
threw
it
out
of
sight
so
they
went
forward
cautiously
along
that
ledge
to
the
end
and
an
end
they
found
sure
enough
so
that
had
we
followed
the
axemen
with
the
sled
we
should
have
had
to
creep
all
the
way
back
again
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
cut
another
land
trail
on
a
bench
that
we
could
reach
where
the
sled
was
stopped
but
that
could
not
be
reached
at
all
farther
on
a
long
and
slow
and
laborious
job
it
was
that
took
most
of
the
morning
to
cut
that
trail
and
then
get
the
load
over
it
to
ice
again
by
noon
we
were
opposite
the
red
mountain
one
of
the
koyukuk
landmarks
and
on
the
site
of
an
old
indian
fishing
camp
william
and
arthur
had
made
a
great
fire
when
we
came
up
and
we
heated
some
beans
and
made
some
tea
and
ate
lunch
a
mile
farther
on
was
the
cabin
of
a
white
man
and
we
paid
him
a
brief
visit
and
got
a
little
tea
from
him
for
ours
was
nearly
gone
it
did
me
good
to
hear
him
sing
the
praises
of
deaconess
carter
the
trained
nurse
at
the
mission
she
had
taken
him
in
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
had
cured
him
already
the
new
mission
was
proving
a
boon
to
whites
as
well
as
natives
we
made
no
more
than
four
or
five
miles
farther
when
coming
to
spruce
with
no
more
in
sight
for
a
long
distance
we
pitched
the
tent
all
very
tired
that
night
the
thermometer
went
to
below
zero
the
coldest
weather
of
the
season
so
far
as
a
consequence
the
next
day
we
had
a
new
and
very
disagreeable
trouble
the
cold
weather
by
increasing
the
amount
of
running
ice
in
the
still
open
stretches
had
brought
about
a
jam
that
had
raised
the
level
of
the
water
and
caused
an
overflow
of
the
ice
a
very
common
phenomenon
of
a
closing
river
we
picked
our
way
much
of
the
day
and
towards
evening
came
to
a
complete
in
the
middle
of
the
river
with
open
water
in
front
and
on
one
hand
and
new
thin
ice
on
the
other
so
we
had
to
turn
round
and
go
back
again
a
long
way
the
being
the
only
traversable
place
until
when
it
seemed
that
we
should
have
to
go
round
another
bend
to
reach
a
crossing
arthur
proposed
that
he
and
william
who
wore
mukluks
should
carry
the
doctor
and
me
who
wore
moccasins
across
the
overflow
and
then
rush
the
sled
across
and
this
we
did
wetting
its
contents
somewhat
however
we
camped
immediately
for
we
had
landed
on
impassable
gravel
sidenote
the
red
mountain
that
night
the
thermometer
went
to
below
zero
and
we
took
good
hope
that
the
cold
which
began
to
approach
the
real
cold
of
winter
would
put
an
end
to
overflow
but
on
the
contrary
it
only
aggravated
the
trouble
for
the
first
mile
or
two
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
through
it
and
at
below
it
is
a
miserable
business
to
be
wading
in
moccasins
even
for
an
hour
we
had
rearranged
our
load
so
that
it
stood
up
somewhat
higher
but
we
could
not
avoid
wetting
the
things
on
the
bottom
of
the
sled
and
the
ice
formed
about
it
very
inconveniently
moreover
the
little
dog
who
had
a
great
dislike
to
wetting
his
feet
began
to
give
us
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
at
one
time
nothing
but
the
admirable
presence
of
mind
and
prompt
action
of
william
saved
us
from
losing
our
whole
load
we
had
reached
a
strip
of
new
dry
ice
formed
the
night
before
with
black
rushing
water
on
the
left
towards
which
the
slippery
surface
sloped
presently
as
we
advanced
we
began
to
encounter
a
little
overflow
water
coming
from
the
bank
on
the
right
seeping
up
between
the
ice
and
the
bank
and
that
dog
to
avoid
wetting
his
feet
in
the
overflow
deliberately
turned
towards
the
open
water
and
set
the
sled
sliding
in
the
same
direction
without
the
crampons
which
we
had
not
used
for
the
past
few
days
it
was
impossible
to
hold
the
sled
against
the
dog
traction
and
in
another
moment
we
should
have
lost
everything
for
the
dog
paid
no
heed
to
our
voices
when
william
with
a
blow
of
his
axe
cut
the
rope
by
which
the
dog
pulled
and
grasping
the
sled
and
throwing
himself
full
length
on
the
ice
managed
to
stop
it
on
the
very
brink
of
the
water
it
was
a
close
shave
but
once
more
we
were
safe
and
the
doctor
in
the
exuberance
of
his
gratitude
said
that
night
if
william
wants
a
glass
eye
i
send
to
new
york
to
get
him
one
but
when
william
learned
that
the
glass
eye
was
a
mere
matter
of
looks
and
would
in
no
wise
improve
his
vision
he
lost
interest
in
it
looks
do
not
count
for
much
amongst
the
koyukuk
indians
illustration
arthur
and
doctor
burke
illustration
saint
allakaket
koyukuk
river
that
night
was
a
long
way
off
yet
however
we
had
other
risks
to
run
other
labours
here
were
two
islands
in
the
river
and
the
current
running
like
a
and
burdened
with
ice
cakes
swept
around
the
shore
of
one
of
them
leaving
the
passage
between
them
quite
dry
there
was
no
shore
ice
at
all
where
the
channel
was
and
it
was
so
a
reach
that
had
there
been
any
there
i
am
sure
we
should
not
have
ventured
it
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
drag
the
sled
half
a
mile
over
the
gravel
and
we
did
it
the
most
labour
of
the
whole
trip
it
took
us
exactly
an
hour
to
make
that
half
mile
william
did
not
know
the
trick
of
the
split
willows
either
so
we
all
four
of
us
sweated
for
our
ignorance
shortly
after
our
guide
pointed
out
the
spot
where
poor
ericson
frozen
body
was
found
two
years
and
eight
months
before
sidenote
a
narrow
escape
sidenote
rubber
ice
near
the
kornuchaket
or
the
mouth
of
old
man
creek
where
the
koyukuk
receives
a
considerable
tributary
we
approached
the
most
dangerous
travelling
we
had
had
yet
the
river
here
is
swift
and
deep
and
there
are
several
islands
set
in
it
most
of
its
surface
was
frozen
but
the
ice
was
very
thin
william
stopped
the
procession
before
we
reached
the
bad
stretch
and
went
hastily
over
a
part
of
it
under
his
single
weight
we
could
see
the
undulating
it
had
been
our
rule
that
ice
was
not
safe
unless
it
took
three
blows
of
the
axe
to
bring
water
but
this
ice
gave
water
at
a
blow
when
william
returned
he
made
quite
an
harangue
which
arthur
interpreted
he
thought
we
could
make
it
past
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
if
we
could
we
should
find
good
going
to
village
but
we
must
go
just
as
fast
as
we
could
travel
we
must
not
let
the
sled
stop
an
instant
the
ice
would
bend
and
crack
but
he
thought
if
we
went
quickly
we
could
get
across
so
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
rushed
that
sled
over
rubber
ice
that
swayed
and
cracked
and
yielded
under
our
feet
and
under
the
sled
until
we
reached
the
bank
of
one
of
the
islands
and
then
again
we
launched
her
and
ran
with
her
to
the
shore
once
one
of
my
feet
broke
through
and
immediately
the
water
welled
up
all
around
with
the
steamboat
channel
underneath
but
without
pause
we
increased
our
speed
and
made
the
strong
shore
ice
safely
at
last
no
man
will
ever
doubt
the
plasticity
the
viscosity
of
ice
as
it
used
to
be
styled
in
the
old
glacier
controversies
who
has
passed
over
the
rubber
ice
that
forms
under
certain
circumstances
and
at
certain
seasons
on
these
rivers
we
would
never
i
am
sure
have
attempted
that
ice
had
not
william
been
with
us
we
would
have
struck
a
blow
with
the
axe
and
declared
it
unsafe
of
course
it
was
unsafe
the
whole
journey
was
unsafe
but
i
am
convinced
that
this
thin
continuous
sheet
of
ice
cushioned
actually
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
out
of
which
it
was
growing
was
really
safer
than
much
of
the
thicker
but
brittle
unsupported
ice
we
had
unhesitatingly
come
over
chemists
tell
us
that
certain
substances
in
the
act
of
formation
which
they
call
nascent
substances
are
extraordinarily
active
and
potent
and
it
may
be
that
ice
in
the
same
state
has
a
special
tenacity
of
texture
which
belongs
to
that
state
alone
i
wish
that
i
could
have
measured
the
thickness
of
that
ice
where
my
foot
went
through
i
know
it
was
very
thin
but
its
thickness
i
will
not
venture
to
guess
there
was
the
distinct
feeling
that
the
water
was
bearing
the
ice
up
and
when
it
was
punctured
the
water
welled
up
with
pressure
behind
it
beyond
the
kornuchaket
much
more
snow
had
fallen
and
a
few
miles
brought
us
to
moses
village
called
grandiosely
arctic
city
since
a
trader
had
established
a
store
and
a
there
at
this
spot
a
new
overland
mail
trail
from
tanana
strikes
the
koyukuk
and
although
ten
or
twelve
miles
remained
we
felt
that
our
journey
was
done
my
sled
dogs
were
there
and
as
i
had
not
seen
them
for
more
than
a
year
that
was
a
joyful
reunion
nanook
bark
of
welcome
which
no
one
but
i
ever
got
with
quite
the
same
inflection
was
as
grateful
to
me
as
all
the
licking
and
slobbering
of
the
others
for
nanook
is
a
very
independent
beast
reserved
in
his
demonstrations
and
not
wearing
his
heart
on
his
sleeve
so
to
speak
they
were
all
glad
to
see
me
old
lingo
and
nig
and
even
jimmy
the
fake
billy
was
dead
for
fifteen
or
sixteen
months
they
had
been
boarded
here
and
since
fish
had
been
very
scarce
the
preceding
summer
their
food
had
been
chiefly
bacon
and
rice
and
tallow
and
there
was
a
bill
of
close
to
four
hundred
dollars
against
us
dogs
are
very
expensive
things
in
this
expensive
country
when
used
the
winter
through
on
the
trail
and
boarded
the
summer
through
at
a
fish
camp
we
estimate
that
it
costs
one
hundred
dollars
per
head
per
annum
to
feed
a
dog
so
that
the
maintenance
of
a
team
of
five
dogs
which
is
the
minimum
practicable
team
will
cost
five
hundred
dollars
per
annum

food

sidenote
saturated
snow
when
we
had
eaten
a
good
supper
and
were
reclining
on
spring
cots
in
the
bunk
house
there
was
not
one
of
us
but
confidently
expected
to
be
at
the
mission
in
the
next
forenoon
for
a
week
past
the
natives
had
been
going
to
and
fro
in
three
or
four
hours
the
river
was
completely
closed
above
here
and
there
was
much
more
snow
than
we
found
below
so
we
hitched
our
own
dogs
to
our
own
sled
the
next
morning
when
the
doctor
had
visited
a
sick
person
or
two
and
started
out
on
the
last
stretch
of
the
journey
all
went
well
until
we
had
turned
the
long
bend
at
the
head
of
which
the
old
abandoned
post
of
bergman
is
situated
just
on
the
arctic
circle
but
a
mile
or
two
beyond
we
were
wallowing
in
saturated
snow
that
stretched
all
across
the
river
right
up
to
the
banks
on
either
side
an
overflow
was
in
progress
the
water
running
along
the
surface
of
the
ice
and
soaking
up
the
snow
so
that
there
was
six
inches
of
slush
all
over
it
we
struggled
along
awhile
though
from
the
first
it
seemed
hopeless
and
then
we
gave
it
up
and
went
back
to
the
there
would
be
no
passing
that
stretch
of
river
with
the
sled
until
the
cold
had
dealt
with
the
overflow
it
is
almost
always
the
unexpected
that
happens
the
next
morning
i
put
on
a
pair
of
doctor
burke
knee
forbade
him
their
use
and
taking
william
with
me
mushed
up
through
the
slush
and
the
snow
to
the
mission
leaving
the
others
to
come
on
with
the
team
so
soon
as
they
found
it
practicable
a
mile
before
we
reached
the
mission
was
the
new
village
built
by
the
esquimaux
kobuk
town
they
call
it
and
right
in
front
of
the
village
the
malamute
riffle
a
noted
difficulty
of
navigation
was
still
running
wide
open
though
all
the
rest
of
the
river
was
long
closed
near
the
riffle
the
kobuks
had
a
and
some
who
were
busy
getting
out
fish
saw
and
recognised
me
and
the
whole
population
came
swarming
out
for
greetings
it
was
good
to
see
these
kindly
simple
people
again
to
shake
their
hands
and
hear
their
i
glad
i
see
you
which
is
the
general
native
greeting
where
there
is
any
english
at
all
every
one
must
shake
hands
even
the
babies
on
their
mothers
backs
stretch
out
their
little
fingers
eagerly
and
if
they
be
too
small
for
that
the
mother
will
take
the
little
hand
and
hold
it
out
at
the
bend
we
take
a
portage
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
brings
us
to
the
allakaket
to
the
familiar
modest
buildings
of
the
mission
with
its
new
koyukuk
village
gradually
clustering
round
it
the
whole
scene
was
growing
into
almost
the
exact
realisation
of
my
dream
when
first
i
camped
on
this
spot
two
years
and
nine
months
before
there
was
a
distinct
thrill
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
church
built
entirely
of
logs
with
the
bark
on
there
was
nothing
visible
anywhere
about
it
but
spruce
bark
save
for
the
gleam
of
the
gilded
cross
that
surmounted
the
little
belfry
the
roof
its
regular
construction
finished
was
covered
with
small
spruce
poles
with
the
bark
on
nailed
together
at
the
apex
and
where
it
projected
well
beyond
the
gables
its
was
covered
with
bark
as
well
as
the
cornice
all
round
that
finished
it
off
even
the
and
the
were
covered
with
bark
it
was
of
the
same
tone
because
of
the
selfsame
substance
as
the
forest
still
growing
around
it
and
it
gave
at
the
first
glance
the
satisfied
impression
of
fitness
it
gave
the
feeling
that
it
belonged
where
it
was
placed
it
is
ill
praising
one
own
work
but
i
had
been
keen
to
see
how
it
would
strike
me
fresh
from
the
outside
after
a
year
absence
and
i
was
very
glad
indeed
that
it
pleased
me
again
sidenote
a
starving
white
man
i
had
no
more
than
entered
upon
the
warm
welcome
that
waited
at
saint
and
was
still
wondering
at
the
homelike
cosiness
which
the
mission
house
had
assumed
under
the
deft
hands
of
the
two
ladies
who
occupied
it
when
there
came
an
indian
with
word
of
a
white
man
he
had
found
starving
in
the
wilderness
fifteen
miles
away
another
native
with
a
dog
team
and
a
supply
of
immediate
food
was
hastily
despatched
to
bring
the
man
in
and
that
night
the
poor
emaciated
fellow
looking
like
a
man
of
or
seventy
though
he
was
really
no
more
than
forty
crawled
out
of
the
sled
and
tottered
into
the
house
he
had
started
out
from
tanana
two
months
before
with
two
to
make
his
way
across
to
the
koyukuk
diggings
had
lost
his
way
and
wandered
aimlessly
in
that
vast
wilderness
one
horse
had
been
drowned
the
other
he
had
killed
for
meat
he
had
made
a
raft
to
come
down
the
kornutna
old
man
creek
to
the
koyukuk
knowing
that
there
was
a
near
its
mouth
and
had
been
frozen
in
and
forced
to
abandon
it
since
that
time
he
had
been
living
on
a
few
spoonfuls
of
meal
a
day
with
frozen
berries
and
once
or
twice
a
ptarmigan
and
when
ned
found
him
was
at
the
last
extremity
and
had
given
up
intending
to
die
where
he
was
that
man
hunger
was
tremendous
but
miss
carter
having
knowledge
and
experience
of
such
cases
was
apprehensive
that
if
any
large
quantity
of
food
were
taken
at
a
time
there
would
be
serious
danger
to
him
so
for
a
day
or
two
he
ate
frequently
but
sparingly
a
little
later
as
he
grew
stronger
to
such
extremes
did
his
hunger
pinch
him
that
he
would
watch
till
there
was
no
one
looking
and
would
go
into
the
kitchen
and
steal
food
that
was
preparing
even
taking
it
out
of
the
on
the
stove
he
would
be
hungry
immediately
after
having
a
full
meal
in
ten
days
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
resume
his
journey
to
the
diggings
and
when
i
saw
him
at
coldfoot
two
months
later
i
did
not
recognise
him
so
greatly
had
he
changed
from
the
poor
shrunken
creature
that
crept
into
the
mission
we
all
think
we
have
been
hungry
time
and
again
if
ever
we
have
gone
a
few
days
on
short
rations
we
are
quite
sure
of
it
this
man
had
sounded
the
height
and
depth
and
stretched
the
length
and
breadth
of
it
and
none
of
the
rest
of
us
really
know
what
hunger
means
i
tried
to
get
him
to
talk
about
it
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
forget
it
he
said
he
was
ashamed
to
think
of
some
of
the
things
he
had
done
and
of
some
of
the
terrible
thoughts
that
had
come
to
him
and
i
pressed
him
no
more
i
have
always
felt
that
even
in
its
last
hideousness
of
cannibalism
only
god
himself
can
judge
starvation
sidenote
two
interpreters
here
began
my
first
experience
of
the
difficulties
of
conducting
a
mission
at
the
same
place
for
two
different
races
of
natives
speaking
totally
different
languages
although
the
indian
language
spoken
here
is
the
same
as
at
tanana
and
much
of
the
liturgy
had
been
put
into
that
tongue
by
prevost
and
was
therefore
available
yet
it
was
found
impracticable
to
have
two
sets
of
services
whenever
the
church
was
used
for
both
races
would
always
attend
anyway
since
the
mastery
of
the
two
tongues
was
out
of
the
question
and
there
were
no
translations
at
all
into
the
esquimau
it
became
a
question
of
teaching
the
esquimaux
to
take
part
in
an
indian
service
or
dropping
both
vernaculars
altogether
and
conducting
the
service
in
english
after
much
doubt
and
experiment
the
latter
was
resolved
upon
and
the
whole
service
of
prayer
and
praise
is
in
english
when
the
lessons
are
read
and
the
address
delivered
it
is
necessary
to
use
two
interpreters
the
minister
delivers
his
sentence
in
english
then
the
koyukuk
interpreter
puts
it
in
indian
and
when
he
is
done
the
esquimau
interpreter
puts
it
into
that
tongue
it
is
a
very
tedious
business
this
double
interpretation
and
a
sermon
takes
fully
an
hour
to
deliver
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
the
singing
is
hearty
and
enthusiastic
though
the
repertory
is
wisely
very
limited
and
here
north
of
the
arctic
circle
is
a
vested
choir
of
eight
or
ten
kobuk
and
koyukuk
boys
who
lead
the
singing
and
lead
it
very
well
already
the
influence
of
the
mission
and
the
school
was
very
marked
given
the
native
off
by
himself
like
this
in
the
hands
of
those
in
whom
he
has
learned
to
place
entire
confidence
remote
from
debasing
agencies
and
his
improvement
is
evident

his
survival

happy
conclusion

perilous
journey
over
the
first
ice
one
is
often
glad
to
have
had
experiences
that
one
would
by
no
means
repeat
and
this
is
a
case
in
point
we
had
learned
a
good
deal
about
ice
we
had
taken
liberties
with
ice
that
none
of
us
had
ever
thought
before
could
be
taken
with
impunity
we
had
learned
to
trust
ice
and
at
the
same
time
to
distrust
it
and
in
some
measure
to
discriminate
about
it
the
last
ice
is
bad
but
the
first
ice
is
much
worse
and
all
three
of
us
were
agreed
that
we
wanted
no
more
travelling
over
it
and
no
more
pulling
of
a
sled
by
the
back
of
the
face
then
followed
a
very
happy
busy
time
of
several
weeks
while
the
river

was
consolidating
and

establishing

with
its
manifold
evidences
of

rapid

in
that
three
weeks
we
travelled
all
day
at

below

and
we
spent
one
night
in
camp
at
below
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
severe
winter
with
much
snow
north
of
the
yukon
and
long
periods
of
great
cold
sidenote
birth
burial
and
dancing
the
two
weeks
or
so
spent
at
the
mission
of
saint
was
enjoyed
as
only
a
rest
is
enjoyed
after
making
such
a
journey
as
only
christmas
is
enjoyed
at
such
a
native
mission
it
is
the
time
of
the
whole
year
for
the
people
they
come
in
from
near
and
far
intent
upon
the
festival
in
both
of
its
aspects
religious
and
social
and
they
enter
so
heartily
into
all
that
is
provided
for
them
that
one
does
not
know
which
to
admire
most
their
simple
earnest
piety
or
the
enthusiasm
of
their
sports
and
pastimes
right
out
of
church
they
go
to
the
frozen
river
old
men
and
maidens
young
men
and
matrons
mothers
with
babies
on
their
backs
and
their
skirts
tucked
up
and
they
quickly
line
up
and
are
kicking
the
football
stuffed
with
moose
hair
and
covered
with
moose
hide
in
the
native
game
that
their
forefathers
played
ages
before
rugby
was
invented
b
when
the
rings
back
they
all
troop
again
to
take
their
places
and
listen
patiently
and
reverently
to
the
long
service
the
babies
still
on
their
mothers
backs
sometimes
asleep
sometimes
waking
up
and
crying
comforted
by
slinging
them
round
and
applying
their
lips
to
the
fountain
of
nourishment
and
solace
on
the
nights
when
there
is
no
church
service
there
is
feasting
and
dancing
the
native
dance
is
a
very
simple
affair
entirely
without
any
objectionable
feature
and
one
can
not
see
any
reason
in
the
world
for
attempting
to
suppress
it
a
man
and
a
woman
get
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
dance
opposite
one
another
without
touching
at
all
the
moccasined
toes
of
an
expert
man
in
this
dance
move
with
surprising
rapidity
the
woman
with
eyes
downcast
the
picture
of
demureness
sways
slightly
from
side
to
side
and
moves
on
her
toes
in
rhythm
to
the
man
movement
presently
another
man
jumps
up
and
the
first
man
yields
his
place
then
another
woman
comes
forward
and
the
first
woman
yields
her
place
and
so
the
dance
goes
on
for
a
variety
of
late
years
there
is
an
occasional
dance
of
the
quadrille
or
the
waltz
kind
but
the
natives
much
prefer
their
own
dancing
here
at
the
allakaket
the
presence
of
the
esquimaux
adds
picturesqueness
and
strangeness
and
the
esquimau
dance
which
consists
of
a
series
of
jerky
attitudinisings
with
every
muscle
tense
to
a
curious
monotonous
chant
and
the
beating
of
a
drum
is
a
source
of
amusement
to
the
indians
an
old
man
funeral
in
the
morning
away
up
on
the
high
bluff
overlooking
the
mission
a
birth
in
the
evening
a
dance
the
same
night
so
goes
the
drama
of
life
in
this
little
isolated
native
world
so
soon
as
these
people
make
up
their
minds
that
one
of
their
number
is
sick
unto
death
they
make
the
coffin
for
when
trees
must
be
felled
and
lumber
whipsawed
from
them
it
is
well
to
be
forehanded
sidenote
before
and
after
there
is
one
old
woman
living
up
there
yet
whose
coffin
had
been
made
three
times
when
it
becomes
evident
that
the
unfavourable
prognosis
was
mistaken
the
coffin
is
torn
apart
and
made
into
shelves
or
some
other
article
of
household
utility
it
seems
very
but
it
is
easy
to
misjudge
these
people
the
emotion
of
grief
is
real
with
them
i
believe
but
transient
they
are
and
entirely
devoid
of
pretence
and
when
once
a
funeral
has
taken
place
and
the
service
is
all
over
they
dismiss
the
gloomy
event
from
their
minds
as
soon
as
possible
the
night
of
old
mesuk
death
however
there
were
fires
lighted
on
all
the
trails
and
before
most
of
the
esquimau
cabins
the
object
of
which
was
probably
to
frighten
the
spirit
away
from
the
dwellings
of
the
living
we
shall
get
the
better
of
these
superstitions
by
and
by
but
superstitions
die
hard
not
only
amongst
esquimaux
moreover
practices
like
this
linger
as
traditional
practices
long
after
their
superstitious
content
is
dissipated
and
men
of
feeling
do
not
wantonly
lay
hands
on
ancient
traditional
custom
i
think
that
if
i
were
an
esquimau
and
knew
that
from
immemorial
antiquity
fires
had
been
lighted
on
the
trails
and
outside
the
doors
upon
the
death
of
my
ancestors
i
should
be
tempted
to
kindle
them
myself
upon
an
occasion
however
firmly
i
held
the
communion
of
saints
and
the
safe
repose
of
the
blessed
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
i
were
a
thlinket
i
should
set
up
a
despite
all
the
missionaries
in
the
world
when
one
comes
to
think
about
it
dispassionately
there
is
really
nothing
in
christianity
averse
to
the
kindling
of
corpse
fires
or
the
blazoning
of
native
heraldry
when
all
the
little
superstitions
and
peculiar
picturesque
customs
are
abolished
out
of
the
world
it
will
be
a
much
less
interesting
world
than
it
is
if
there
were
any
evidence
or
reason
to
believe
that
morality
and
religion
will
be
furthered
by
the
or
cajoling
of
the
little
peoples
into
a
close
similitude
of
the
white
race
in
dress
and
manners
and
customs
all
other
considerations
would
of
course
be
swallowed
up
in
a
glad
welcome
of
such
advance
but
almost
the
exact
opposite
is
true
the
young
indian
or
esquimau
who
by
much
mixing
with
white
men
has
been
wised
up
as
the
expressive
phrase
goes
here
is
commonly
one
of
the
least
useful
the
least
attractive
the
least
moral
of
his
kind
we
have
many
such
on
the
yukon
young
men
who
work
on
the
steamboats
in
the
summer
and
do
odd
jobs
and
hang
around
the
stores
in
winter
and
will
not
condescend
to
fish
any
more
or
to
hunt
or
trap
unless
driven
by
the
pinch
of
hunger
show
me
an
indian
who
affects
the
white
man
in
garb
in
speech
in
general
habits
and
external
characteristics
and
it
will
be
easy
to
show
an
indian
whose
death
would
be
little
loss
to
his
community
or
his
race
while
the
native
woman
who
aspires
to
dress
herself
like
a
white
woman
has
very
commonly
the
purpose
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
white
men
i
think
the
young
indian
man
i
recall
as
the
best
dressed
most
debonair
and
most
completely
civilised
was
living
in
idleness
upon
the
bounty
of
the
white
trader
whom
every
one
knew
to
be
his
paramour
and
was
impudently
careless
of
the
general
knowledge
of
all
the
photographs
that
illustrate
missionary
publications
and
i
have
contributed
enough
villainous
to
warrant
me
in
a
criticism
the
ones
i
dislike
most
are
of
the
before
and
after
type
here
is
a
group
of
savages
clad
in
skins
or
furs
or
feathers
or
palm
fibre
or
some
patient
skilful
weave
of
native
wool
or
grass
in
each
case
clad
congruously
with
their
environment
and
out
of
the
products
it
affords
set
against
it
is
the
same
or
a
similar
group
clad
out
of
the
clad
in
hickory
shirts
and
trousers
clad
so
that
if
faces
could
be
changed
as
easily
as
clothing
they
would
pass
for
any
commonplace
group
of
whites
anywhere
and
as
if
such
change
were
in
itself
the
symbol
and
guarantee
of
a
change
from
all
that
is
brutal
and
idolatrous
to
all
that
is
gentle
and
christian
there
follows
the
triumphant
before
and
after
inscription
all
the
fitness
has
gone
all
the
individuality
all
the
clever
adaptation
of
indigenous
material
all
the
artistic
and
human
interest
and
a
smirk
of
superiority
radiates
over
factory
garments
instead
whenever
i
see
such
contrasting
photographs
there
comes
over
me
a
shamed
perverse
recollection
of
a
pair
of
engravings
by
hogarth
usually
suppressed
which
a
london
bookseller
once
pulled
out
of
a
portfolio
in
the
back
room
of
his
shop
and
showed
me
they
bore
the
same
title
i
profess
myself
a
friend
of
the
native
tongue
because
it
is
the
native
tongue
the
easy
familiar
natural
vehicle
of
expression
of
the
native
dress
because
it
is
almost
always
comfortable
and
comely
of
the
native
customs
whenever
they
are
not
unhealthy
or
demoralising
because
they
are
the
distinctive
heritage
of
a
people
and
again
of
tongue
dress
and
customs
alike
if
you
will
simply
because
they
are
dissimilar
sidenote
a
barren
uniformity
for
it
has
always
seemed
a
trumpery
notion
that
uniformity
in
these
things
has
any
connection
with
the
upbuilding
of
a
people
has
any
ethical
relation
at
all
and
i
have
always
wondered
that
so
trumpery
a
notion
should
have
so
wide
an
influence
moreover
is
it
not
a
little
curious
that
whereas
the
trend
of
biological
evolution
on
its
upward
course
as
spencer
assures
us
is
towards
differentiation
and
dissimilarity
the
trend
of
sociological
evolution
should
be
so
marked
towards
this
bald
and
barren
uniformity
but
these
be
deep
matters
i
have
never
been
able
to
join
in
the
reproach
of
superciliousness
so
often
applied
to
the
lines
of
that
noblest
of
missionary
hymns
in
which
bishop
heber
asks
can
we
whose
souls
are
lighted
with
wisdom
from
on
high
can
we
to
men
benighted
the
lamp
of
life
deny
if
that
be
superciliousness
it
is
an
essential
superciliousness
of
christianity
itself
for
the
question
lies
at
the
very
core
of
our
religion
and
will
not
cease
to
be
asked
so
long
as
the
world
contains
those
who
believe
with
all
their
hearts
and
those
who
do
not
believe
because
they
have
not
heard
i
never
listen
to
that
hymn
without
emotion
it
can
still
shake
me
like
a
cry
of
trumpets
going
by
but
the
question
that
seems
to
stir
the
souls
of
some
missionaries
and
most
can
we
deny
to
these
unfortunate
heathen
our
millinery
our
oaken
bucket
our
and
our
leaves
me
quite
cold
here
was
the
weekly
afternoon
routine
at
this
mission
only
the
mornings
being
devoted
to
books
and
classes
on
monday
the
children
brought
their
soiled
clothes
of
the
week
to
the
schoolroom
and
washed
them
on
tuesday
they
were
dried
and
ironed
on
wednesday
they
were
mended
on
thursday
a
juvenile
society
did
some
sort
of
work
for
another
mission
on
friday
every
child
in
the
village
had
a
hot
bath
now
let
a
routine
of
that
sort
be
kept
up
week
after
week
month
after
month
year
after
year
during
the
whole
school
life
of
a
child
and
it
is
bound
to
leave
its
mark
and
there
is
no
other
way
in
which
the
same
mark
may
be
made
at
the
allakaket
is
fine
example
of
what
i
think
is
the
best
rule
in
the
world
for
the
inferior
races
the
absolute
rule
of
a
devoted
intelligent
capable
gentlewoman
we
are
but
now
writing
the
indentures
of
their
apprenticeship
to
in
the
elective
village
councils
we
have
set
up
it
is
good
for
them
to
serve
it
under
this
loving
and
unquestioned
despotism
sidenote
matters
meteorological
during
all
that
christmas
season
the
temperature
was
subject
to
such
violent
fluctuations
that
a
chart
of
them
would
look
like
the
picture
showing
the
comparative
heights
of
mountains
that
used
to
be
presented
under
the
world
in
hemispheres
in
the
school
geographies
a
minimum
of
below
zero
and
a
maximum
of
below
was
followed
by
a
minimum
of
below
and
a
maximum
of
below
and
that
by
a
minimum
of
below
and
a
maximum
of
below
while
on
christmas
day
itself
we
registered
a
minimum
of
below
zero
and
a
maximum
of
above
a
range
of
in
less
than
twelve
hours
at
a
time
of
the
year
when
the
sun
has
scarcely
any
effect
upon
the
temperature
such
tremendous
changes
point
to
corresponding
atmospheric
disturbances
and
each
rise
was
caused
by
the
irruption
of
clouds
upon
a
clear
sky
and
was
followed
by
a
fall
of
snow
it
is
a
beautifully
simple
process
driven
into
these
regions
by
some
compelling
current
of
the
upper
atmosphere
comes
a
mass
of
warm
air
laden
with
moisture
a
cloud
as
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
cold
air
of
the
region
it
parts
with
its
heat
and
the
temperature
of
the
lower
air
rises
having
parted
with
its
heat
it
can
no
longer
contain
its
moisture
and
having
parted
with
its
moisture
it
ceases
to
exist
the
cold
of
the
earth
and
of
its
immediate
air
envelope
has
seized
upon
that
cloud
and
devoured
it
and
the
cold
resumes
its
sway
so
have
i
opened
the
door
of
a
crowded
cabin
when
an
indian
dance
or
other
gathering
was
in
progress
at
or
below
zero
and
the
cold
dry
air
meeting
the
hot
moist
air
has
caused
an
immediate
fall
of
snow
on
the
threshold
after
the
abrupt
rise
in
temperature
on
christmas
day
the
snow
began
to
fall
heavily
with
a
barometer
continually
falling
until
it
reached
inches
the
lowest
point
recorded
here
at
an
elevation
of
about
feet
above
the
sea
in
two
years
and
a
half
and
before
the
snow
ceased
three
feet
had
fallen
our
winter
itinerary
called
us
to
leave
the
allakaket
immediately
after
new
year
day
and
our
route
lay
overland
through
a
totally
uninhabited
country
for
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
tanana
on
the
yukon
we
knew
that
it
would
not
greatly
interfere
with
our
plans
to
lie
another
week
at
the
allakaket
and
that
would
bring
our
departure
after
the
monthly
journey
of
the
and
would
thus
compel
him
to
break
trail
for
us
through
all
that
snow
that
is
the
way
the
in
alaska
are
usually
treated
but
arthur
and
i
took
some
pride
in
keeping
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
announced
dates
of
visitation
and
in
doing
such
share
of
trail
breaking
as
fell
to
us
sidenote
trail
breaking
so
on
monday
the
of
january
we
bade
farewell
to
deaconess
carter
and
her
colleague
and
to
the
native
charges
they
rule
and
care
for
so
admirably
and
set
out
on
our
journey
with
an
additional
boy
from
the
mission
to
help
us
through
the
heavy
snow
of
the
koyukuk
valley
for
ten
or
twelve
miles
the
way
lay
down
the
river
and
the
going
was
slow
and
toilsome
from
the
first
although
there
had
been
some
passage
from
moses
village
to
the
mission
and
there
was
therefore
some
trail
our
start
had
been
late
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
get
an
early
start
from
a
mission
there
is
always
some
native
who
must
have
audience
at
the
last
moment
and
after
the
long
repose
we
were
so
soft
that
the
heavy
trail
had
wearied
us
and
we
decided
to
call
it
a
day
when
in
five
and
a
half
hours
we
came
to
the
the
last
occupied
habitation
between
the
allakaket
and
tanana
soon
after
we
reached
the
village
there
came
trooping
down
from
the
mission
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
gone
up
for
christmas
who
after
weeping
upon
our
necks
so
to
speak
at
our
departure
had
left
us
to
break
out
that
drifted
trail
for
their
convenient
return
so
will
indians
treat
a
white
man
almost
always
but
i
had
thought
myself
an
exception
and
was
vexed
to
find
that
so
they
had
treated
me
the
next
morning
we
entered
the
uninhabited
wilderness
with
three
feet
of
new
snow
on
the
trail
and
no
passage
over
it
since
it
had
fallen
our
first
trouble
was
finding
the
trail
at
all
the
previous
fall
the
alaska
road
commission
had
appropriated
a
sum
of
money
to
stake
this
trail
from
tanana
to
the
koyukuk
river
for
it
passes
over
treeless
wastes
where
many
men
had
lost
their
way
starting
out
from
tanana
the
men
employed
had
done
their
work
well
until
within
ten
miles
of
the
koyukuk
river
there
it
was
found
that
the
labour
and
cost
already
expended
had
exhausted
the
appropriation
whereupon
the
proceedings
were
immediately
stopped
not
another
stake
was
driven
and
the
whole
party
returned
to
tanana
and
mushed
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
up
the
yukon
to
spend
another
little
appropriation
upon
another
trail
that
is
the
unbusinesslike
system
in
which
the
money
available
for
such
work
in
alaska
has
been
handled
the
first
trail
breaker
goes
ahead
with
a
long
stick
which
he
thrusts
continually
down
through
the
snow
the
slightly
harder
surface
over
which
sleds
and
dogs
have
passed
reveals
itself
by
offering
more
resistance
to
the
penetration
of
the
stick
and
that
is
the
only
way
the
trail
can
be
found
even
with
three
feet
of
new
snow
upon
it
it
is
well
worth
while
finding
or
otherwise
there
is
no
bottom
at
all
and
way
must
be
made
through
all
the
snow
of
the
winter
but
all
alaskan
trails
are
serpentine
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
put
the
new
trail
right
on
top
of
the
old
one
back
and
forth
the
second
trail
breaker
goes
between
his
leader
and
the
sled
and
at
intervals
the
first
man
comes
back
and
forth
also
and
with
it
all
is
no
path
packed
solid
enough
for
the
dogs
to
draw
the
heavy
sled
without
great
difficulty
we
should
have
had
a
toboggan
but
toboggans
are
little
used
on
the
koyukuk
and
we
had
only
our
sled
in
five
hours
we
made
five
miles
and
were
worn
out
we
decided
to
pitch
our
tent
and
go
ahead
and
break
trail
for
the
journey
on
the
lakes
interspersed
amongst
the
brush
we
had
to
break
an
entirely
new
trail
for
we
could
find
no
trace
of
the
old
one
if
five
miles
in
five
hours
be
poor
going
what
is
four
miles
in
seven
and
a
half
hours
that
is
all
we
made
the
next
day
despite
the
of
the
previous
evening
the
heavy
sled
was
continually
getting
off
the
trail
however
wide
we
it
the
two
of
us
ahead
went
over
every
step
of
the
distance
four
or
five
times
and
sometimes
all
of
us
had
to
go
back
and
forth
again
and
again
before
the
sled
could
be
brought
along
at
all
it
was
from
to
above
zero
all
day
and
at
intervals
snow
fell
heavily
we
got
at
last
to
the
middle
of
a
little
lake
and
were
confronted
by
open
water
the
result
of
some
warm
spring
one
supposes
here
we
must
stop
until
a
laborious
journey
was
made
to
the
bank
trees
were
cut
and
carried
and
the
open
place
bridged
so
that
the
sled
might
be
passed
over
it
then
again
our
painful
progress
was
resumed
until
as
it
grew
dark
we
reached
the
bank
of
the
kornutna
or
old
man
creek
and
here
we
pitched
tent
again
and
i
went
forward
upon
the
bed
of
the
stream
to
break
out
a
part
of
path
that
night
two
more
inches
of
snow
fell
sidenote
dog
driving
for
four
miles
the
trail
lies
along
the
surface
of
this
creek
and
then
takes
up
a
steep
gully
and
over
a
divide
that
four
miles
was
all
we
made
the
next
day
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
wearily
tramping
it
to
and
fro
dogs
and
men
alike
exhausted
with
the
toil
the
hatefulness
of
dog
mushing
usually
appears
under
such
circumstances
the
whip
is
constantly
plied
the
senseless
objurgations
rise
shriller
and
fuller
once
the
sled
is
started
it
must
by
any
means
be
kept
going
that
as
great
a
distance
as
possible
may
be
covered
before
it
stops
again
the
poor
brutes
sinking
almost
to
their
bellies
despite
the
have
no
purchase
for
the
exercise
of
their
strength
and
continually
flounder
and
wallow
our
whip
was
lost
and
i
was
glad
of
it
for
even
as
considerate
a
boy
as
arthur
is
apt
to
lose
patience
and
temper
when
having
started
the
sled
with
much
labour
by
gee
pole
and
rope
about
his
chest
it
goes
but
a
few
feet
and
comes
to
a
halt
again
or
slips
from
the
track
and
turns
over
in
the
deep
snow
but
it
is
at
such
times
too
that
one
appreciates
at
his
full
value
such
a
noble
puller
as
our
wheel
dog
nanook
he
spares
himself
not
at
all
the
one
absorbing
occupation
of
every
nerve
and
muscle
of
his
body
is
pulling
his
trace
is
always
taut
or
if
he
lose
footing
for
a
moment
and
the
trace
slacken
he
is
up
and
at
it
again
that
the
sled
lose
not
its
momentum
if
he
can
help
it
when
the
lead
line
is
pulled
back
that
the
sled
may
be
started
by
the
jerk
of
the
dogs
sudden
traction
nanook
lunges
forward
at
the
command
mush
and
strains
at
the
collar
mouth
open
and
panting
tongue
dropping
moisture
as
keen
and
eager
to
keep
that
sled
moving
as
is
the
driver
himself
all
day
he
labours
and
struggles
snatching
a
mouthful
of
snow
now
and
then
to
cool
his
overheated
body
and
he
drops
in
his
tracks
when
the
final
halt
is
made
utterly
weary
yet
always
with
the
brave
heart
in
him
to
give
his
bark
his
characteristic
bark
of
gladness
that
the
day
work
is
done
at
last
it
is
senseless
brutality
to
whip
such
a
dog
and
most
of
our
dogs
were
of
that
mettle
though
nanook
was
the
strongest
and
most
faithful
of
the
bunch
one
heart
goes
out
to
them
with
gratitude
and
love
old
lingo

snowball
wolf
and

as
one
realises
what
loyal
cheerful
service
they
give
sidenote
violent
fluctuations
arthur
was
so
unwell
with
a
violent
cold
and
cough
that
had
been
growing
worse
for
a
couple
of
days
that
i
decided
on
two
things
to
leave
him
in
the
tent
while
i
ahead
the
next
day
and
to
send
back
the
boy
i
had
brought
from
the
mission
to
secure
a
fresh
supply
of
food
for
the
back
trail
was
of
course
comparatively
easy
condition
threatened
pneumonia
to
my
notion
and
i
believe
he
was
saved
from
an
attack
of
that
disease
which
is
so
often
fatal
in
this
country
by
long
rubbing
all
over
the
neck
and
the
chest
with
a
remedy
that
was
new
then
a
menthol
balm
i
have
used
it
again
and
again
since
and
i
am
now
never
without
it
a
second
application
made
in
the
morning
i
started
out
up
the
long
hill
and
then
down
into
the
flat
and
so
to
the
little
hut
that
is
reached
under
good
conditions
of
trail
the
first
day
from
moses
village
and
then
back
again
to
the
tent
that
day
a
tendon
in
my
right
leg
behind
the
knee
became
increasingly
troublesome
and
in
climbing
the
hill
on
the
return
was
acutely
painful
i
recognised
it
as
well
known
in
the
northwest
where
the
snow
is
commonly
much
deeper
than
in
alaska
and
i
found
relief
in
the
application
of
the
same
analgesic
menthol
balm
that
i
was
rejoiced
to
find
had
wrought
a
great
improvement
in
condition
meanwhile
the
warm
weather
of
the
past
three
or
four
days
was
over
and
another
period
of
violent
fluctuations
of
temperature
similar
to
that
around
christmastide
was
upon
us
we
went
to
bed
with
the
thermometer
at
below
zero
and
were
wakened
by
the
cold
at
two
in
the
morning
to
find
it
at
below
so
we
had
to
keep
a
fire
going
the
rest
of
the
night
for
as
soon
as
the
fire
in
the
stove
goes
out
a
tent
becomes
just
as
cold
as
outdoors
we
moved
forward
the
next
morning
but
the
trail
we
had
broken
was
too
narrow
and
had
to
be
widened
which
meant
one
in
the
deep
snow
all
the
time
a
very
fatiguing
process
that
brought
into
painful
play
again
the
tendon
strained
with
five
days
heavy
the
temperature
was
around
below
all
day
and
our
progress
was
so
slow
that
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
warm
and
the
dogs
whined
at
the
innumerable
stops
yesterday
it
had
been
below
the
day
before
above
and
now
below
it
is
hard
to
dress
for
such
changeable
weather
especially
hard
to
dress
the
feet
my
own
wear
all
the
winter
through
is
a
pair
of
breeches
tanned
on
the
yukon
but
tailored
outside
they
are
a
perfect
windbreak
yet
allow
ventilation
and
they
are
very
warm
but
those
who
perspire
much
on
exertion
can
not
wear
them
the
amount
of
covering
upon
the
feet
must
be
varied
in
some
measure
at
least
as
the
temperature
changes
the
esquimau
fur
boot
with
fur
on
the
inside
of
the
sole
and
on
the
outside
of
the
upper
is
my
favourite
footwear
with
more
or
less
of
sock
inside
it
as
the
weather
requires
but
such
sudden
changes
as
we
were
experiencing
always
find
one
or
leave
one
with
too
much
or
too
little
footwear
by
we
had
struggled
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
it
was
very
evident
that
the
cabin
was
out
of
the
question
that
day
so
since
to
pass
down
into
the
flat
was
to
pass
out
of
eligible
camping
timber
we
pitched
tent
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
cold
business
of
making
camp
was
done
all
dispositions
for
the
night
complete
supper
for
men
and
dogs
was
cooked
and
ours
eating
when
we
heard
a
noise
in
the
distance
that
set
our
dogs
barking
and
presently
came
the
boy
i
had
sent
back
accompanied
by
an
indian
and
a
fresh
team
loaded
with
such
a
bountiful
supply
of
food
much
of
it
cooked
that
one
felt
it
was
worth
while
to
get
into
distress
to
receive
such
generous
and
prompt
succour
the
ladies
at
the
mission
had
sat
up
and
cooked
all
night
and
had
despatched
the
fastest
team
in
the
village
the
next
morning
to
bring
their
provisions
to
us
and
to
help
us
along
they
had
thought
us
at
tanana
when
we
were
not
yet
at
the
end
of
the
first
stage
from
moses
village
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
us
to
reach
tanana
on
the
dog
food
and
man
food
we
started
with
sidenote
below
zero
it
was
so
cold
and
we
were
so
crowded
that
i
arose
at
three
and
made
a
fire
and
sat
over
it
the
rest
of
the
night
and
after
breakfast
although
it
was
sunday
morning
prayer
being
said
i
started
ahead
again
to
break
out
the
trail
deeper
and
wider
leaving
the
teams
with
the
distributed
loads
to
follow
the
thermometer
stood
at
below
zero
when
i
left
camp
but
as
i
began
the
descent
it
was
evident
that
it
grew
colder
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
i
was
sure
it
was
colder
at
least
reaching
the
cabin
i
kindled
a
fire
and
started
back
to
meet
the
teams
about
a
mile
from
the
cabin
i
saw
them
for
since
the
load
was
distributed
in
the
two
sleds
progress
was
much
better
but
by
this
time
it
had
grown
so
cold
that
the
dogs
were
almost
entirely
obscured
from
view
by
the
clouds
of
steam
that
encompassed
them
we
hurried
as
best
we
might
and
reached
the
cabin
about
eleven
and
as
soon
as
we
were
arrived
i
took
out
the
thermometer
and
let
it
lie
long
enough
to
get
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
it
read
below
zero
there
had
been
no
atmospheric
change
at
all
it
was
simply
the
most
marked
instance
i
ever
knew
of
the
influence
of
altitude
upon
temperature
we
had
descended
perhaps
three
hundred
feet
and
in
that
distance
had
found
a
difference
of
in
temperature
the
cabin
was
a
wretched
shack
without
door
or
window
and
full
of
holes
and
in
no
part
of
it
could
one
stand
upright
we
set
ourselves
to
make
things
as
comfortable
as
possible
however
rigging
up
the
canvas
sled
cover
for
an
outer
door
and
a
blanket
for
an
inner
door
and
stopping
up
the
worst
of
the
holes
with
sacking
then
we
went
out
and
cut
fresh
spruce
boughs
to
lie
upon
and
prospected
around
quite
a
while
before
we
found
dry
wood
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
it
was
quite
a
business
cutting
that
wood
and
packing
the
heavy
sticks
on
one
shoulders
through
the
brush
and
up
and
down
the
banks
of
the
little
creek
where
it
grew
on
at
below
zero
our
sabbath
day
journey
done
the
hut
safely
reached
and
furnished
with
fuel
we
did
not
linger
long
after
supper
but
evening
prayer
said
went
to
bed
as
the
most
comfortable
place
in
the
still
cold
cabin
thankful
not
to
be
in
a
tent
in
such
severe
weather
the
next
day
gave
us
fresh
temperature
fluctuations
at
nine
it
clouded
and
rose
to
below
by
noon
it
had
cleared
again
and
the
thermometer
fell
to
below
and
at
nine
it
stood
once
more
at
below
the
milder
weather
of
the
morning
sent
all
hands
out
breaking
trail
save
myself
for
with
all
our
stuff
in
a
cabin
without
a
door
it
was
not
wise
to
leave
it
altogether
a
dog
might
break
a
chain
and
work
havoc
so
i
stayed
behind
in
the
little
dark
hovel
a
candle
burning
all
day
and
read
some
fifty
pages
of
boswell
of
samuel
over
again
some
such
little
classic
it
is
my
habit
to
carry
each
winter
last
year
i
reread
pepys
and
the
year
before
much
of
the
and
certain
places
are
for
ever
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
rereading
of
certain
old
books
the
chandalar
river
is
to
me
as
much
the
scene
of
which
i
read
for
the
sixth
or
seventh
time
on
my
first
journey
along
it
as
exmoor
itself
and
cloister
and
the
that
noble
historical
romance
belongs
in
my
literary
geography
to
the
portage
so
will
boswell
always
bring
back
to
me
this
trip
across
country
from
the
koyukuk
to
the
yukon
through
the
deep
snow
the
boys
came
back
after
dark
having
broken
some
nine
miles
of
trail
and
having
suffered
a
good
deal
from
the
cold
i
had
supper
cooked
and
when
that
was
done
and
the
dogs
fed
we
fell
to
reading
the
gospels
and
epistles
for
the
epiphany
season
the
boys
reading
aloud
by
turns
the
fire
had
warmed
the
little
hut
thoroughly
and
despite
the
cold
outside
we
were
snug
and
comfortable
within
sidenote
seventy
below
zero
that
night
the
thermometer
touched
below
zero
within
of
the
greatest
cold
i
have
recorded
in
seven
years
winter
travel
a
greater
cold
i
believe
than
any
arctic
expedition
has
ever
recorded
for
it
is
in
a
continental
climate
like
siberia
or
interior
alaska
and
not
in
the
marine
climate
around
the
north
pole
that
the
thermometer
falls
lowest
save
for
an
hour
or
two
getting
wood
we
all
lay
close
next
day
for
the
temperature
at
noon
was
no
higher
than
below
it
is
impossible
to
break
trail
at
such
temperature
or
to
travel
as
slowly
as
we
were
travelling
in
the
strong
cold
one
must
travel
fast
if
one
travel
at
all
indeed
it
is
distinctly
dangerous
to
be
outdoors
as
soon
as
one
leaves
the
hut
the
cold
smites
one
in
the
face
like
a
mailed
fist
the
expiration
of
the
breath
makes
a
crackling
sound
due
one
judges
to
the
sudden
congealing
of
the
moisture
that
is
expelled
from
every
cranny
of
the
cabin
a
stream
of
vapour
pours
into
the
air
giving
the
appearance
that
the
house
is
on
fire
within
however
warmly
hands
and
feet
may
be
clad
one
can
not
stand
still
for
a
minute
without
feeling
the
heat
steadily
oozing
out
and
the
cold
creeping
in
notwithstanding
the
weather
that
evening
the
mail
came
along
the
white
man
who
is
the
carrier
two
tall
strong
natives
and
nine
dogs
only
since
descending
to
the
flat
had
they
suffered
from
the
cold
for
they
found
as
great
a
difference
as
we
did
in
the
temperature
and
they
were
grateful
to
us
for
the
trail
we
had
broken
the
hut
was
uncomfortably
crowded
that
night
with
seven
people
in
it
but
the
thermometer
stood
at
and
was
rising
and
gave
us
hope
that
we
might
move
along
augmented
as
our
party
was
into
seven
men
three
sleds
and
nineteen
or
twenty
dogs
trail
breaking
would
not
be
so
arduous
and
progress
would
be
much
accelerated
there
was
good
hope
moreover
that
the
heavy
snow
was
confined
to
the
koyukuk
valley
and
that
when
we
passed
out
of
it
we
should
find
better
going
the
morning
found
a
temperature
of
below
and
we
sallied
forth
quite
an
expedition
four
including
myself
went
ahead
beating
down
the
trail
one
was
at
each
gee
pole
our
team
last
getting
advantage
of
everything
preceding
so
far
as
the
trail
had
been
broken
we
made
good
time
covering
the
nine
miles
in
about
four
hours
another
hour
of
somewhat
slower
progress
took
us
to
the
top
of
a
hill
and
here
the
two
indians
had
run
ahead
and
built
a
great
roaring
fire
and
arranged
a
wide
commodious
couch
of
spruce
boughs
and
we
cooked
our
lunch
and
took
our
ease
for
half
an
hour
the
sky
had
clouded
again
and
the
temperature
had
risen
to
below
sidenote
close
quarters
it
is
strange
how
some
scenes
of
the
trail
linger
in
the
memory
while
others
are
completely
forgotten
this
noon
halt
i
always
remember
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
of
all
my
journeyings
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
and
the
smoke
rose
straight
into
the
air
instead
of
volleying
and
eddying
into
one
face
as
so
often
do
on
whichever
side
of
them
one
sits
we
were
all
weary
with
our
five
hours
trudge
and
the
rest
was
grateful
hungry
and
the
boiled
ham
they
had
sent
from
the
mission
was
delicious
the
warmth
of
the
great
fire
and
the
cosiness
of
the
thick
deep
spruce
boughs
gave
solid
comfort
and
the
pipe
after
the
meal
was
a
luxurious
enjoyment
from
that
on
the
going
was
heavier
and
our
progress
slower
but
we
kept
at
it
till
dark
and
still
far
into
the
night
fortunate
in
having
two
indians
who
knew
every
step
of
the
way
until
at
last
we
reached
the
hut
that
marks
the
end
of
the
second
stage
from
the
koyukuk
river
on
the
top
of
a
birch
hill
we
had
made
nineteen
and
a
half
miles
that
day
and
had
taken
eleven
hours
to
do
it
if
the
noon
rest
be
remembered
as
one
of
the
pleasantest
episodes
of
the
trail
that
night
in
the
cabin
on
the
hill
i
recall
as
one
of
the
most
miserable
in
my
life
the
hut
was
still
smaller
than
the
previous
one
like
it
without
door
and
window
and
so
low
that
one
was
bent
double
all
the
time
walls
and
roof
alike
were
covered
with
a
thick
coating
of
frost
the
only
wood
discoverable
in
the
dark
was
birch
which
would
not
burn
in
the
stove
but
sent
out
volumes
of
smoke
that
blinded
us
when
the
hut
did
begin
to
get
a
little
warm
moisture
from
the
roof
dropped
on
everything
there
we
seven
men
huddled
together
chilly
and
damp
choked
and
weary
a
wretched
band
there
was
no
room
for
the
necessary
cooking
operations
we
had
to
cook
and
eat
in
relays
and
how
we
slept
in
what
way
seven
men
managed
to
pack
themselves
and
stretch
themselves
in
those
narrow
quarters
i
can
not
tell
however
we
said
our
prayers
and
went
to
bed
snow
falling
heavily
the
indians
were
soon
snoring
but
sleep
would
not
come
to
me
tired
as
i
was
and
i
had
not
slept
at
all
the
previous
night
so
presently
i
took
trional
x
and
dozed
off
till
morning
then
we
resolved
to
divide
forces
rather
than
subject
ourselves
to
the
miserable
inconvenience
of
overcrowding
these
tiny
huts
and
at
this
stage
of
the
journey
it
was
possible
to
do
so
without
losing
a
whole
day
for
there
was
a
cabin
for
the
noon
rest
it
was
arranged
that
the
should
start
first
and
make
the
full
day
run
if
possible
while
we
should
call
it
a
day
at
the
hut
so
bob
and
his
indians
sallied
forth
while
yet
my
boys
were
reading
their
lessons
to
me
and
when
they
were
done
we
hitched
up
and
followed
and
as
soon
as
we
were
down
the
hill
and
started
along
the
bald
flat
it
was
evident
that
we
were
out
of
the
deep
snowfall
for
the
present
at
any
rate
and
we
plucked
up
spirit
for
we
were
now
to
cross
the
wide
open
uplands
of
the
headwaters
of
the
melozitna
and
tozitna
tributaries
of
the
yukon
the
tozi
and
melozi
as
the
white
men
call
them
where
snow
never
lies
deep
or
long
we
were
out
of
the
koyukuk
watershed
now
and
in
country
drained
by
direct
tributaries
of
the
yukon
the
going
was
now
incomparably
the
best
we
had
had
since
we
left
the
mission
the
snow
was
light
and
we
had
the
trail
but
although
the
temperature
had
risen
to
below
a
keen
wind
put
our
parkee
hoods
up
and
our
scarfs
around
our
faces
and
made
our
below
clothing
none
too
warm
in
three
hours
we
had
reached
the
melozi
cabin
although
that
had
included
the
climbing
of
a
long
steep
hill
and
here
we
stayed
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
and
shot
some
ptarmigan
for
supper
though
we
could
easily
have
gone
on
and
made
the
rest
of
the
run
the
next
day
i
sent
the
auxiliary
sled
and
team
and
driver
back
to
the
allakaket
keeping
the
mission
boy
with
me
however
to
return
with
the
who
was
already
late
and
must
go
back
as
soon
as
he
reached
tanana
i
parted
with
the
indian
regretfully
for
he
had
been
most
helpful
and
always
and
cheerful
and
had
really
begun
to
learn
a
little
at
our
travelling
sidenote
the
staked
trail
sidenote
the
arctic
skies
a
high
wind
was
blowing
with
the
thermometer
at
below
and
the
trail
was
already
drifted
over
and
quite
indistinguishable
in
the
dark
and
we
began
to
appreciate
the
recent
staking
of
this
trail
by
the
road
commission
but
for
these
stakes
set
double
a
hundred
yards
apart
so
that
they
formed
a
lane
it
would
have
been
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
us
to
travel
on
a
day
like
this
for
here
was
a
stretch
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
miles
with
never
a
tree
and
hardly
the
smallest
bush
the
wind
blew
stronger
and
stronger
directly
in
our
faces
as
we
rose
out
of
the
melozitna
basin
on
the
hill
that
is
its
watershed
and
when
the
summit
was
reached
and
we
turned
and
looked
back
there
was
nothing
visible
but
a
white
waste
but
ahead
all
the
snow
was
most
beautifully
and
delicately
tinted
from
the
reflection
of
the
dawn
on
ragged
shredded
clouds
that
streamed
across
the
southeastern
sky
where
the
sky
was
free
of
cloud
it
gave
a
wonderful
clear
green
that
was
almost
but
not
quite
the
colour
of
malachite
it
was
exactly
the
colour
of
the
water
the
propeller
of
a
steamship
churns
up
where
the
atlantic
ocean
shallows
to
the
rocky
shore
of
the
north
coast
of
ireland
the
clouds
themselves
caught
a
deep
dull
red
from
the
sunrise
which
the
snow
gave
back
in
blush
pink
such
an
exquisite
colour
harmony
did
the
scene
compose
that
the
wind
lulling
for
a
moment
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
seemed
charmed
into
peace
by
it
the
feast
of
colour
brought
a
train
of
colour
memories
one
hard
upon
the
heels
of
another
as
we
went
down
the
hill
the
catbells
this
golden
with
bracken
that
purple
with
heather
and
each
doubled
in
the
depths
of
derwentwater
an
october
morning
in
the
hardwood
forests
of
the
mountains
of
tennessee
when
for
half
an
hour
every
gorgeous
tint
of
red
and
yellow
was
lavishly
flaunted
and
then
the
whole
pride
and
splendour
of
it
wiped
out
at
once
by
a
wind
that
sprang
up
the
encircling
and
towering
reds
and
pinks
of
a
gigantic
amphitheatre
of
rock
in
the
dolomites
a
patch
of
flowers
right
against
the
snow
in
the
high
rockies
so
intensely
blue
that
it
seemed
the
whole
vault
of
heaven
could
be
tinctured
with
the
pigment
that
one
petal
would
distil
and
more
inspiring
than
them
all
there
came
the
recollection
of
that
wonderful
sunrise
and
those
blazing
mountains
of
the
portage
every
land
has
its
glories
and
the
sky
is
everywhere
a
blank
canvas
for
the
display
of
splendid
colour
but
the
tints
of
the
arctic
sky
are
of
an
infinite
purity
of
individual
tone
that
no
other
sky
can
show
as
we
descended
the
hill
into
the
tozitna
basin
the
wind
rose
again
now
charged
with
heavy
driving
snow
while
in
the
valley
the
underfoot
snow
grew
deep
so
that
it
was
drawing
to
dusk
when
we
reached
the
cabin
on
a
fork
of
the
tozitna
where
bob
the
had
spent
the
previous
night
and
there
we
stayed
the
next
day
is
worthy
of
record
for
the
sharp
contrast
it
affords
all
the
night
it
had
snowed
heavily
and
it
snowed
all
the
morning
and
into
the
afternoon
some
sixteen
or
seventeen
inches
of
snow
had
fallen
since
bob
and
his
party
passed
and
again
we
had
no
trail
at
all
moreover
strange
plaint
in
january
in
alaska
the
weather
grew
so
warm
that
the
snow
continually
balled
up
under
the
and
clung
to
the
sled
and
the
dogs
at
noon
the
thermometer
stood
at
above
zero
and
it
was
but
four
days
ago
that
we
recorded
below
it
will
be
readily
understood
how
such
wide
and
sudden
ranges
of
temperature
add
to
the
inconvenience
and
discomfort
of
mushing
parkees
sweaters
shirts
are
shed
one
after
the
other
the
fur
cap
becomes
a
nuisance
the
mittens
a
burden
and
still
ploughing
through
the
snow
he
is
bathed
in
sweat
who
had
forgotten
what
sweating
felt
like
the
poor
dogs
suffer
the
most
for
they
have
nothing
they
can
shed
and
they
can
perspire
only
through
the
mouth
their
tongues
drop
water
almost
in
a
stream
they
labour
for
their
breath
and
their
eyes
have
a
look
that
comes
only
with
soft
weather
and
a
heavy
trail
so
constantly
do
they
grab
mouthfuls
of
snow
that
the
operation
becomes
quite
a
check
on
our
progress
by
two
it
was
growing
dusk
and
we
had
but
reached
the
bank
of
the
other
fork
of
the
tozitna
not
more
than
eight
or
nine
miles
from
the
cabin
where
we
spent
the
night
and
yet
thirteen
or
fourteen
miles
from
the
cabin
we
had
hoped
to
reach
beyond
the
banks
of
the
stream
was
no
more
timber
for
a
long
distance
was
such
another
stretch
of
open
country
as
we
had
passed
the
previous
day
so
here
was
another
disappointment
for
camp
must
be
made
now
lest
there
be
no
chance
to
make
camp
at
all
but
it
was
a
good
and
comfortable
camp
amidst
the
large
spruce
of
the
watercourse
such
disappointments
are
part
of
life
on
the
trail
and
supper
done
there
was
the
more
time
for
the
boys
the
open
country
was
again
and
being
the
snow
was
somewhat
hardened
and
we
fought
our
way
against
a
gale
covering
the
twelve
and
three
quarter
miles
in
ten
hours
sunday
though
it
was
at
that
last
stage
on
the
road
to
tanana
came
out
a
young
man
from
the
mission
with
a
dog
team
and
an
indian
anxious
at
our
long
delay
and
harry
strangman
name
is
written
here
with
grateful
recognition
of
this
kindness
and
many
others
we
went
joyfully
into
town
on
the
morrow
the
of
january
having
taken
fifteen
days
to
make
a
journey
that
is
normally
made
in
five
sidenote
the
on
that
last
day
mush
we
met
the
returning
to
the
koyukuk
so
much
had
he
been
delayed
that
there
was
danger
of
a
fine
and
all
sorts
of
trouble
and
the
mail
had
been
sent
out
to
meet
him
at
the
noon
cabin
together
with
a
supply
of
grub
for
the
return
trip
but
the
caterer
whoever
he
was
forgot
candles
and
the
would
have
had
to
make
his
way
back
to
the
koyukuk
without
any
means
of
artificial
light
in
the
shortest
days
of
the
year
had
we
not
been
able
to
supply
him
with
half
a
dozen
candles
that
remained
to
us
it
was
a
disappointment
to
george
the
boy
i
had
brought
from
the
mission
that
he
must
turn
round
and
go
back
also
he
had
never
seen
tanana
which
is
quite
a
metropolis
to
him
and
had
looked
forward
to
it
keenly
all
the
journey
but
the
boy
braced
up
and
took
his
disappointment
manfully
a
pitiful
procession
it
was
that
passed
us
by
and
took
our
boy
away
the
poor
wearied
dogs
that
had
certainly
earned
the
few
days
rest
they
were
so
badly
in
need
of
left
a
trail
of
blood
behind
them
that
was
sickening
to
see
almost
every
one
of
them
had
sore
frozen
feet
many
of
them
were
lame
and
when
we
came
to
descend
the
long
hill
they
had
just
climbed
right
at
its
brow
where
the
stiffest
pull
had
been
was
a
claw
from
a
dog
foot
frozen
into
bloody
snow
so
far
as
there
is
anything
heroic
about
the
alaskan
trail
the
are
the
real
heroes
they
must
start
out
in
all
weathers
at
all
temperatures
they
have
a
certain
specified
time
in
which
to
make
their
trips
and
they
must
keep
within
that
time
or
there
is
trouble
the
bordering
country
of
the
canadian
yukon
has
a
more
humane
government
than
ours
there
neither
nor
any
one
else
save
in
some
emergency
with
licence
from
the
northwest
mounted
police
may
take
out
horse
or
dogs
to
start
a
journey
when
the
temperature
is
lower
than
below
zero
but
i
have
seen
a
reluctant
chased
out
at
below
zero
on
pain
of
losing
his
job
on
the
american
side
moreover
between
the
seasons
when
travel
on
the
rivers
is
positively
dangerous
to
life
the
mail
must
still
be
despatched
and
received
although
so
great
is
the
known
risk
to
the
mail
as
well
as
to
the
carrier
that
no
one
will
send
any
letter
that
he
cares
at
all
about
reaching
its
destination
until
the
trails
are
established
or
the
steamboats
run
but
the
virtually
empty
pouches
must
be
transported
from
office
to
office
through
the
running
or
over
the
rotting
ice
just
the
same
on
pain
of
the
high
displeasure
and
penalty
of
a
department
without
brains
and
without
bowels
i
have
often
wished
since
i
came
to
alaska
that
i
could
be
for
one
week
and
so
i
suppose
has
almost
every
other
resident
of
the
country
the
week
following
my
arrival
at
tanana
was
a
solid
week
of
cold
weather
the
thermometer
ranging
around
and
below
zero
and
that
means
keeping
pretty
close
to
the
house
even
the
sentries
at
the
army
post
are
withdrawn
and
the
protection
of
the
garrison
is
confided
to
a
man
who
watches
the
grounds
from
a
cupola
above
the
headquarters
building
yet
a
week
of
confinement
and
inaction
grows
tiresome
after
life
in
the
open
sunday
is
always
a
busy
day
here
the
mission
and
native
village
are
three
miles
away
from
the
town
and
service
must
be
held
at
both
the
mission
at
tanana
is
not
a
happy
place
to
visit
for
one
who
has
the
welfare
of
the
natives
at
heart
despite
faithful
and
devoted
effort
to
check
it
the
demoralisation
goes
on
apace
and
the
outlook
is
dark
sidenote
single
men
in
barracks
single
men
in
barracks
do
grow
into
plaster
saints
we
are
told
sometimes
they
seem
to
grow
into
drunken
lustful
devils
without
compassion
for
childhood
not
to
mention
any
feeling
of
magnanimity
towards
a
feebler
race
and
when
a
girl
who
has
been
or
who
has
been
given
drink
until
she
is
unable
to
resist
the
multiple
outrage
practised
upon
her
is
told
to
pick
out
the
malefactors
from
a
company
of
soldiers
all
all
dressed
alike
all
around
the
same
age
she
generally
fails
to
identify
altogether
so
the
offence
goes
unwhipped
and
the
officer
is
likely
as
not
to
address
a
reprimand
to
the
complaining
missionary
for
preferring
charges
you
are
unable
to
substantiate
yet
an
officer
who
had
himself
written
such
a
letter
told
me
once
that
all
indians
looked
alike
to
him
even
should
the
girl
identify
one
or
more
men
they
have
usually
half
a
dozen
comrades
ready
to
swear
an
alibi
add
to
the
trouble
given
by
the
soldiers
the
constant
operation
of
the
slinking
bootleggers
of
the
town
a
score
or
more
of
whom
are
known
to
make
money
by
this
liquor
peddling
and
some
of
whom
do
nothing
else
for
a
living
yet
whom
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
convict
owing
to
the
cumbrous
machinery
of
the
law
and
the
attitude
of
juries
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
hands
of
those
who
are
fighting
for
the
native
race
are
tied
what
has
been
said
about
the
military
does
not
by
any
means
apply
to
all
either
officers
or
men
some
of
the
officers
have
been
decent
men
conscious
of
the
evil
and
zealous
to
suppress
it
some
of
the
men
indeed
in
all
probability
most
of
the
men
quite
free
from
such
offence
some
commanding
officers
have
kept
such
a
post
that
offences
of
all
kinds
have
been
greatly
reduced
but
the
commanding
officer
is
changed
every
year
and
the
whole
force
is
changed
every
two
years
so
that
there
is
no
continuity
of
policy
at
the
post
and
an
administration
that
has
grown
familiar
with
conditions
and
that
stands
so
far
as
it
can
for
clean
living
and
sobriety
and
decency
and
the
protection
of
the
native
people
may
be
followed
by
one
that
is
loftily
ignorant
of
the
situation
careless
about
offences
against
morality
and
impatient
of
any
complaint
off
by
himself
separate
from
the
demoralising
influence
of
the
white
there
is
every
hope
and
encouragement
in
the
effort
to
elevate
and
educate
the
indian
set
down
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
riffraff
of
towns
and
barracks
his
fate
seems
sealed
sidenote
and
let
these
two
mission
stations
the
allakaket
and
tanana
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
or
so
apart
by
the
winter
trail
represent
the
two
conditions
in
six
years
time
there
has
been
manifest
advance
at
the
one
and
decay
at
the
other
the
is
greatly
in
excess
of
the
at
the
allakaket
the
greatly
in
excess
of
the
at
tanana
in
the
year
in
which
this
journey
was
made
there
were
deaths
and
fourteen
births
at
tanana
and
while
the
difference
was
an
unusually
large
one
yet
in
the
six
years
referred
to
there
has
not
been
one
year
in
which
the
number
of
births
exceeded
the
number
of
deaths
one
does
not
have
to
be
a
prophet
to
foresee
the
inevitable
result
if
the
process
be
not
stopped
a
tribute
should
be
paid
to
the
zeal
now
of
one
now
of
another
army
surgeon
at
fort
gibbon
in
tending
the
native
sick
three
miles
away
when
we
have
been
unable
to
procure
a
physician
of
our
own

the

nurse
for
five
years

has
been

up

then
across

to
the
hot

on
the

river
the
miles
up
the
yukon
was
through
the
lower
ramparts
one
of
the
most
picturesque
portions
of
this
great
river
the
stream
is
confined
in
one
deep
channel
by
lofty
mountains
on
both
banks
and
the
scenery
at
times
is
very
bold
and
wild
but
its
topography
makes
it
the
natural
wind
course
of
the
country
a
wind
in
winter
an
wind
in
summer
blows
almost
continually
it
was
no
colder
than
below
zero
when
we
started
on
the
trip
but
the
wind
made
the
travelling
unpleasant
the
second
day
it
had
increased
to
a
gale
and
every
mile
we
travelled
it
grew
stronger
we
travelled
three
hours
and
the
last
hour
we
made
scarcely
a
mile
so
thickly
charged
with
flying
snow
was
the
wind
and
so
dead
ahead
that
despite
parkee
hoods
it
blinded
us
and
the
dogs
could
hardly
be
forced
to
keep
their
heads
towards
it
their
faces
were
so
coated
with
crusted
snow
that
they
looked
curiously
like
the
face
of
harlequin
in
the
pantomime
it
did
become
literally
intolerable
and
when
arthur
said
that
he
knew
there
was
a
cabin
right
across
the
river
we
made
our
way
thither
and
shortly
found
it
and
lay
there
the
rest
of
the
day
the
gale
blowing
incessantly
this
was
disappointing
because
it
meant
that
i
could
not
reach
rampart
for
the
sunday
i
had
appointed
next
day
the
wind
had
ceased
and
the
thermometer
went
down
to
below
zero
in
places
the
ice
was
blown
clear
of
snow
in
other
places
it
was
heavily
drifted
by
midday
we
had
reached
the
lonely
telegraph
station
at
the
rapids
and
were
very
kindly
received
by
the
men
in
charge
they
gave
us
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
would
take
no
money
there
is
little
travel
on
this
part
of
the
river
nowadays
and
the
telegraph
men
are
glad
to
see
any
one
who
may
chance
to
pass
by
we
pushed
on
heavily
again
and
had
to
stop
and
cut
a
gee
pole
presently
for
it
was
hard
to
handle
the
sled
without
it
but
the
gee
pole
always
means
laborious
travel
the
cold
was
welcome
it
meant
no
wind
and
we
were
glad
to
see
the
thermometer
drop
lower
than
below
zero
that
night
at
the
old
mail
cabin
the
mail
goes
no
longer
on
the

fort

to
tanana

barring
this
point

we
were
travelling

is

the
route

should
traverse

spot

hundred

miles

at

the

small
and
scattered
it
is
true
on
the
same
grounds
alaska
might
be
denied
any
mail
at
all
there
has
been
much
resentment
at
this
abandonment
of
the
yukon
river
by
the
and
several
petitions
for
its
restoration
but
it
has
not
been
restored
sidenote
the
yukon
we
travelled
all
the
next
day
at
below
zero
and
it
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
days
of
the
winter
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind

going
steadily
improved
and
best
of
all

three
hours

were
travelling
in

the
first

winter
only
those
who
have
been
deprived
of
the
sun
can
really
understand
how
joyful
and
grateful
his
return
is
there
was
no
heat
in
his
rays
this
last
day
of
january
the
thermometer
stood
at
below
at
noon
and
had
risen
but
since
our
start
in
the
morning
but
the
mere
sight
of
him
glowing
in
the
south
where
a
great
bend
of
the
river
gave
him
to
us
through
a
gap
in
the
mountains
was
cheerful
and
invigorating
after
two
months
in
which
we
had
seen
no
more
than
his
gilding
of
the
high
snows
the
sun
gives
life
to
the
dead
landscape
colour
to
the
oppressive
monotony
of
white
and
black

from

up

and
follows
the
valley
to
its
head
then
crosses
a
summit
and
passes
down
through
several
small
mining
settlements
to
the
hot
springs
the
trail
saves
traversing
two
sides
of
the
triangle
which
it
makes
with
the
two
rivers
the
dogs
feet
and
legs
had
suffered
so
much
from
the
deep
snow
and
the
heavy
labour
of
the
journey
out
of
the
koyukuk
and
the
rough
ice
of
the
yukon
that
i
was
compelled
to
have
not
merely
moccasins
but
leggings
made
here
coming
right
up
to
the
belly
and
tying
over
the
back
all
the
hair
was
worn
away
from
the
back
of
the
legs
and
the
skin
was
in
many
places
raw
we
had
thought
to
cover
the
or
thirty
miles
up
the
valley
and
over
the
summit
to
a
just
beyond
its
foot
but
rough
drifted
trails
and
a
high
wind
held
us
back
until
it
was
dark
before
the
ascent
was
reached
and
we
pitched
our
tent
and
reserved
the
climb
for
the
morrow
it
was
a
hard
grind
owing
to
the
drifted
snow
and
the
wind
that
still
disputed
our
passage
but
the
view
from
the
summit
nearly
eighteen
hundred
feet
above
last
night
camp
was
compensation
enough
for
it
gave
us
the
great
mountain
denali
or
as
the
map
makers
and
some
white
men
call
it
mount
mckinley
perhaps
an
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
as
the
crow
flies
it
rose
up
and
filled
all
the
angle
of
vision
to
the
southwest
it
is
not
a
peak
it
is
a
region
a
great
soaring
of
the
earth
crust
rising
twenty
thousand
feet
high
so
enormous
in
its
mass
in
its
and
glaciers
its
buttresses
its
flanking
spurs
its
terraces
of
and
approaches
that
it
completely
dominates
the
view
whenever
it
is
seen
at
all
i
have
heard
people
say
they
thought
they
had
seen
denali
as
i
have
heard
travellers
say
they
thought
they
had
seen
mount
everest
from
darjiling
but
no
one
ever
thought
he
saw
denali
if
he
saw
it
at
all
there
is
no
possible
question
about
it
once
the
mountain
has
risen
before
the
eyes
and
although
mount
everest
is
but
the
highest
of
a
number
of
great
peaks
while
denali
stands
alone
in
unapproached
predominance
yet
i
think
the
man
who
has
really
looked
upon
the
loftiest
mountain
in
the
world
could
have
no
doubt
about
it
ever
after
how
my
heart
burns
within
me
whenever
i
get
view
of
this
great
monarch
of
the
north
there
it
stood
revealed
from
base
to
summit
in
all
its
stupendous
size
all
its
glistening
majesty
i
would
far
rather
climb
that
mountain
than
own
the
richest
in
alaska
yet
how
its
apparent
nearness
mocks
one
what
time
and
cost
and
labour
are
involved
even
in
approaching
its
base
with
food
and
equipment
for
an
attempt
to
reach
its
summit
how
many
schemes
i
have
pondered
and
dreamed
these
seven
years
past
for
climbing
it
some
day
time
and
opportunity
and
resource
may
serve
please
god
and
i
may
have
that
one
of
my
desires
if
not
still
it
is
good
to
have
seen
it
from
many
different
coigns
of
vantage
from
this
side
and
from
that
to
have
felt
the
awe
of
its
vast
swelling
bulk
the
superb
dignity
of
its
uplift
to
the
skies
with
a
whole
continent
for
a
pedestal
to
have
gazed
eagerly
and
longingly
at
its
serene
untrodden
summit
far
above
the
eagle
flight
above
even
the
most
daring
airman
venture
and
to
have
desired
and
hoped
to
reach
it
to
desire
and
hope
to
reach
it
still
d
plunging
down
the
steep
descent
we
went
for
four
miles
and
then
after
a
hearty
dinner
at
the
essayed
to
make
miles
more
to
the
hot
springs
but
night
fell
again
with
a
number
of
miles
yet
to
come
the
recent
storm
had
furrowed
the
trail
diagonally
with
hard
windrows
of
snow
that
overturned
the
sled
repeatedly
and
formed
an
hindrance
that
grew
greater
and
greater
and
again
we
made
camp
in
the
dark
short
of
our
expected
goal
of
late
i
had
been
carrying
an
hip
ring
a
rubber
ring
inflated
by
the
breath
that
is
the
best
substitute
for
a
mattress
the
ring
had
been
left
behind
at
rampart
and
so
dependent
does
one
grow
on
the
little
luxuries
and
ameliorations
one
permits
oneself
that
these
two
nights
in
camp
were
almost
sleepless
for
lack
of
it
sidenote
the
hot
springs
three
hours
more
brought
us
to
the
spacious
hotel
with
its
forty
empty
rooms
that
had
been
put
up
out
of
all
sense
or
keeping
in
a
wild
plunging
attempt
to
exploit
the
hot
springs
and
make
a
great
health
resort
of
the
place
the
hot
water
had
been
piped
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
to
spacious
in
the
hotel
all
sorts
of
expense
had
been
lavished
on
the
place
but
it
had
been
a
failure
from
the
first
and
has
since
been
closed
and
has
fallen
into
dilapidation
the
bottoms
have
dropped
out
of
the
cement
baths
the
paper
hangs
drooping
from
the
damp
walls
the
unsubstantial
foundations
have
yielded
until
the
floors
are
heaved
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
e
but
at
this
time
the
hotel
was
still
maintained
and
we
stayed
there
and
its
wide
and
lobby
formed
an
excellent
place
to
gather
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
town
for
divine
service
again
the
only
opportunity
in
the
year
what
a
curious
phenomenon
thermal
springs
constitute
in
these
parts
here
is
a
series
of
patches
of
ground
free
from
snow
while
all
the
country
has
been
covered
two
or
three
feet
deep
these
four
months
green
with
vegetation
while
all
living
things
elsewhere
are
wrapped
in
winter
sleep
here
is
open
rushing
water
throwing
up
clouds
of
steam
that
settles
upon
everything
as
dense
hoar
frost
while
all
other
water
is
held
in
the
adamantine
fetters
of
the
ice
where
does
that
constant
unfailing
stream
of
water
at
fahrenheit
come
from
where
does
it
get
its
heat
i
know
of
half
a
dozen
such
thermal
springs
in
alaska
one
far
away
above
the
arctic
circle
between
the
upper
courses
of
the
kobuk
and
the
noatak
rivers
that
i
have
heard
strange
tales
about
from
the
esquimaux
and
that
i
have
always
wanted
to
visit
whenever
i
see
this
gush
of
hot
water
in
the
very
midst
of
the
ice
and
the
snow
i
am
reminded
of
my
surprise
on
the
top
of
mount
tacoma
we
had
climbed
some
eight
thousand
feet
of
snow
and
were
shivering
in
a
bitter
wind
on
the
summit
yet
when
the
hand
was
thrust
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
it
had
to
be
withdrawn
by
reason
of
the
heat
one
knows
about
the
internal
fire
of
some
portion
of
the
earth
mass
of
course
but
such
striking
manifestations
of
it
such
bold
irruption
of
heat
in
the
midst
of
the
kingdom
of
the
cold
must
always
bring
a
certain
astonishment
except
to
those
who
take
everything
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
evident
that
this
hot
water
capable
of
distribution
over
a
considerable
area
of
land
makes
an
exceedingly
favourable
condition
for
subarctic
agriculture
and
a
great
deal
of
ground
has
been
put
under
cultivation
with
large
yield
of
potatoes
and
cabbage
and
other
vegetables
but
the
limitations
of
alaskan
conditions
have
shorn
all
profit
from
the
enterprise
there
is
no
considerable
market
nearer
than
fairbanks
almost
two
hundred
miles
away
by
the
river
if
the
potatoes
are
allowed
to
remain
in
the
ground
until
they
are
mature
there
is
the
greatest
danger
of
the
whole
crop
freezing
while
on
the
way
to
market
and
in
any
case
the
around
fairbanks
find
that
their
proximity
to
the
consumer
more
than
offsets
the
advantage
of
the
hot
springs
sidenote
arctic
agriculture
when
the
great
initial
difficulties
of
farming
in
alaska
are
overcome
when
the
moss
is
removed
and
the
ground
frozen
solidly
to
bedrock
is
broken
and
thawed
when
its
natural
acidity
is
counteracted
by
the
application
of
some
alkali
and
its
reeking
surface
moisture
is
drained
away
when
after
three
or
four
years
cultivation
it
begins
to
make
some
adequate
return
of
roots
and
greens
there
remains
the
constant
difficulty
of
a
market
around
the
mining
settlements
and
during
the
uncertain
life
of
the
mining
settlements
pays
very
well
but
it
could
easily
be
overdone
so
that
prices
would
fall
below
the
point
of
any
profit
at
all
transportation
is
expensive
and
rates
for
a
short
haul
on
the
rivers
are
high
out
of
all
proportion
to
rates
for
the
long
haul
from
the
outside
so
that
potatoes
from
the
pacific
coast
are
brought
in
and
sold
in
competition
with
the
and
despite
the
protestations
of
the
agricultural
experimental
stations
the
outside
or
chechaco
potato
has
the
advantage
of
far
better
quality
than
that
grown
in
alaska
tastes
differ
and
a
man
may
speak
only
as
he
finds
for
my
part
i
have
eaten
native
potatoes
raised
in
almost
every
section
of
interior
alaska
and
have
been
glad
to
get
them
but
i
have
never
eaten
a
native
potato
that
compared
favourably
with
any
good
outside
potato
the
native
potato
is
commonly
wet
and
waxy
i
have
never
seen
a
native
potato
that
would
burst
into
a
glistening
mass
of
white
flour
or
that
had
the
flavour
of
a
really
good
potato
there
has
been
much
misconception
about
the
interior
of
alaska
that
obtains
yet
in
some
quarters
although
there
is
no
excuse
for
it
now
not
only
the
interior
of
alaska
but
all
land
at
or
near
in
the
arctic
regions
that
is
not
under
glacial
is
snow
free
and
in
the
summer
and
has
a
luxuriant
vegetation
the
polar
ox
sverdrup
protest
against
the
term
should
surely
prevail
ranges
in
great
bands
north
of
the
parallel
and
must
secure
abundant
food
and
when
peary
determined
the
insularity
of
greenland
he
found
its
most
northerly
point
a
mass
of
verdure
and
flowers
no
doubt
potatoes
and
turnips
lettuce
and
cabbage
could
be
raised
anywhere
in
those
regions
the
intensity
of
the
season
compensates
for
its
shortness
the
sun
is
in
the
heavens
hours
in
the
day
and
all
living
things
sprout
and
grow
with
amazing
rankness
and
celerity
under
the
strong
compulsion
of
his
continuous
rays
spring
comes
literally
with
a
shout
and
a
rush
here
in
alaska
and
must
cry
even
louder
and
stride
even
faster
in
the
ultimate
climes
of
the
pole
if
the
possibility
of
raising
and
tubers
constitutes
a
farming
country
then
all
the
arctic
regions
not
actually
under
glacial
ice
may
be
so
classed
any
one
who
visits
the
koyukuk
may
see
monster
turnips
and
cabbages
raised
at
coldfoot
near
the
parallel
from
sir
william
description
we
may
feel
quite
sure
that
vegetables
of
size
and
excellence
might
be
raised
at
the
head
of
bushnan
cove
of
melville
island
on
the
parallel
he
called
it
an
arctic
paradise
greely
reported
grass
inches
high
and
many
butterflies
in
the
interior
of
grinnell
land
under
the
parallel
and
if
gold
were
ever
discovered
on
the
north
coast
of
greenland
one
might
quite
expect
to
hear
that
some
enterprising
swede
was
growing
turnips
and
cabbages
at
cape
morris
jessup
above
the
parallel
and
getting
a
dollar
a
pound
for
them
in
favourable
seasons
and
in
favourable
spots
of
interior
alaska
certain
early
varieties
of
siberian
oats
and
rye
have
been
matured
and
it
stands
to
the
credit
of
the
experiment
station
at
rampart
that
a
little
wheat
was
once
ripened
there
though
it
took
thirteen
months
from
the
sowing
to
the
ripening
when
the
rest
of
the
world
fills
up
so
that
economic
pressure
demands
the
utilisation
of
all
earth
that
will
produce
any
sort
of
food
it
may
be
that
large
tracts
in
alaska
will
be
put
under
the
plough
but
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
nine
tenths
of
all
this
vast
country
will
ever
be
other
than
wild
waste
land
at
present
the
farming
population
is
strictly
an
appendage
of
the
mining
population
and
the
mining
population
rather
diminishes
than
increases
your
health
resort
that
no
one
will
resort
to
is
a
dull
place
at
best
and
a
poor
dependence
for
merchandising
so
that
the
little
town
of
hot
springs
is
fortunate
in
having
some
mining
country
around
it
to
fall
back
upon
for
its
trade
we
lay
an
extra
day
there
waiting
for
the
stage
from
fairbanks
to
break
trail
for
us
through
the
heavy
drifted
snow
having
had
enough
of
trail
breaking
for
a
while
at
midnight
the
stage
came
two
days
late
and
its
coming
caused
me
as
keen
a
sorrow
and
as
great
a
loss
as
i
have
had
since
i
came
to
alaska
sidenote
nanook
death
we
knew
naught
of
it
until
the
next
morning
when
breakfast
done
and
the
sled
lashed
we
were
ready
to
hitch
the
dogs
and
depart
they
had
been
put
in
the
horse
stable
for
there
was
no
dog
house
the
health
resorter
actual
or
prospective
is
not
likely
to
be
a
dog
man
one
supposes
but
they
were
loose
in
the
morning
and
came
to
the
call
all
but
one
nanook
him
we
sought
high
and
low
and
at
last
arthur
found
him
but
in
what
pitiful
case
he
dragged
himself
slowly
and
painfully
along
his
poor
bowels
hanging
down
in
the
outer
hide
of
his
belly
fearfully
injured
internally
done
for
and
killed
already
it
was
not
difficult
to
account
for
it
when
the
horses
came
in
at
midnight
one
of
them
had
kicked
the
dog
and
ruptured
his
whole
abdomen
there
was
no
use
in
inquiring
whose
fault
it
was
the
dogs
should
have
been
chained
so
much
was
our
fault
but
it
was
hard
to
resist
some
bitter
recollection
that
before
this
exploitation
of
the
springs
when
there
was
a
modest
instead
of
a
mammoth
hotel
there
had
been
kennels
for
dogs
instead
of
nothing
but
stables
for
horses
i
doubt
if
all
the
veterinary
surgeons
in
the
world
could
have
saved
the
dog
but
there
was
none
to
try
and
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
hate
it
as
we
might
arthur
and
i
were
grateful
that
neither
of
us
had
to
do
it
for
the
driver
of
the
mail
stage
who
had
some
compunctions
of
conscience
i
think
volunteered
to
save
us
the
painful
duty
i
know
how
you
feel
he
said
slowly
and
kindly
i
got
a
dog
i
think
a
heap
of
myself
but
that
dog
ai
nothin
to
me
an
i
do
it
for
you
nanook
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
all
over
with
him
head
and
tail
down
the
picture
of
resigned
dejection
he
stood
like
a
petrified
dog
and
when
i
put
my
face
down
to
his
and
said
he
licked
me
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
in
the
six
years
i
had
owned
him
and
driven
him
i
had
never
felt
his
tongue
before
though
i
had
always
loved
him
best
of
the
bunch
he
was
not
the
licking
kind
we
hitched
up
our
diminished
team
and
pulled
out
for
we
had
thirty
miles
to
make
in
the
short
daylight
and
we
had
lost
time
already
and
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
steaming
slough
we
saw
the
man
going
slowly
down
to
the
river
with
the
dog
the
chain
in
one
hand
a
gun
in
the
other
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
could
not
look
at
arthur
nor
he
at
me
as
i
passed
forward
to
run
ahead
of
the
team
and
i
was
glad
when
i
realised
that
we
had
drawn
out
of
all
day
as
i
trudged
or
trotted
now
on
and
now
off
as
the
trail
varied
in
badness
that
dog
was
in
my
mind
and
his
loss
upon
my
heart
the
feel
of
his
tongue
upon
my
cheek
it
takes
the
close
companionship
between
a
man
and
his
dogs
in
this
country
travelling
all
the
winter
long
winter
after
winter
through
the
bitter
cold
and
the
storm
and
darkness
through
the
long
pleasant
days
of
the
warm
sunshine
of
approaching
spring
sharing
labour
and
sharing
ease
sharing
privation
and
sharing
plenty
it
takes
this
close
companionship
to
make
a
man
appreciate
a
dog
as
i
reckoned
it
up
nanook
had
fallen
just
short
of
pulling
my
sled
ten
thousand
miles
if
he
had
finished
this
season
with
me
he
would
have
done
fully
that
and
i
had
intended
to
pension
him
after
this
winter
to
provide
that
so
long
as
he
lived
he
should
have
his
fish
and
rice
every
day
some
doubt
i
had
had
of
old
lingo
lasting
through
the
winter
but
none
of
nanook
and
they
were
the
only
survivors
of
my
original
team
sidenote
the
talking
dog
nanook
was
in
as
good
spirits
as
ever
i
knew
him
that
last
night
coming
to
me
and
plumping
his
huge
fore
paws
down
on
my
moccasins
challenging
me
to
play
the
game
of
toe
treading
that
he
loved
and
whenever
he
beat
me
at
it
he
would
seize
my
ankle
in
his
jaws
and
make
me
hop
around
on
one
foot
to
his
great
delight
he
was
my
talking
dog
he
had
more
different
tones
in
his
bark
than
any
other
dog
i
ever
knew
he
never
came
to
the
collar
in
the
morning
he
never
was
released
from
it
at
night
without
a
cheery
and
we
never
stopped
finally
to
make
camp
but
he
lifted
up
his
voice
there
was
something
curious
about
that
only
two
nights
before
when
we
had
been
unable
to
reach
the
health
resort
owing
to
drifts
right
across
the
trail
that
overturned
the
heavy
sled
again
and
again
swing
the
gee
pole
as
one
would
and
had
stopped
several
times
in
the
growing
dusk
to
inspect
a
spot
that
seemed
to
promise
a
camping
place
arthur
had
remarked
that
nanook
never
spoke
until
the
spot
was
reached
on
which
we
decided
to
pitch
the
tent
what
faculty
he
had
of
recognising
a
good
place
of
seeing
that
both
green
spruce
and
dry
spruce
were
there
in
sufficient
quantity
i
do
not
know
or
whether
he
got
his
cue
from
the
tones
of
our
voice
but
he
never
failed
to
give
tongue
when
the
stop
was
final
and
never
opened
his
mouth
when
it
was
but
tentative
i
could
almost
tell
the
nature
of
any
disturbance
that
arose
from
the
tone
of
nanook
bark
was
it
some
stray
indian
dog
prowling
round
the
camp
was
it
the
distant
howling
of
wolves
was
it
the
approach
of
some
belated
traveller
there
was
a
distinct
difference
in
the
way
he
announced
each
i
well
remember
the
new
note
that
came
into
his
passionate
protest
when
he
was
chained
to
a
stump
at
the
reindeer
camp
and
the
foolish
creatures
streamed
all
over
the
that
night
to
have
them
right
beside
him
and
yet
be
unable
to
reach
them
to
have
them
brushing
him
with
their
antlers
while
he
strained
helplessly
at
the
chain
was
adding
insult
to
injury
and
he
kept
me
awake
over
it
all
night
and
told
me
about
it
at
intervals
all
next
day
the
coat
that
dog
had
was
the
heaviest
and
thickest
i
ever
saw
on
his
back
the
long
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
underneath
the
hair
was
fur
and
underneath
the
fur
was
wool
he
was
an
outdoors
dog
strictly
it
was
only
in
the
last
year
or
two
that
he
could
be
induced
voluntarily
to
enter
a
house
he
seemed
like
mowgli
to
have
a
suspicion
of
houses
and
if
he
did
come
in
he
had
no
respect
for
the
house
at
all
when
first
i
had
him
he
would
dig
and
scratch
out
of
a
on
the
coldest
night
if
he
could
and
lay
himself
down
comfortably
on
the
snow
cold
meant
little
to
him
fifty
sixty
seventy
below
zero
all
night
long
at
such
temperatures
he
would
sleep
quite
contentedly
the
only
difference
i
could
see
that
these
low
temperatures
made
to
him
was
an
increasing
dislike
to
be
disturbed
when
he
had
carefully
tucked
his
nose
between
his
paws
and
adjusted
his
tail
over
all
he
had
gone
to
bed
and
to
make
him
take
his
nose
out
of
its
nest
and
uncurl
himself
was
like
throwing
the
clothes
off
a
sleeping
man
he
never
dug
a
hole
for
himself
in
the
snow
i
never
saw
a
dog
do
that
yet
in
my
opinion
that
is
one
of
the
stories
a
dog
lies
in
snow
just
as
he
lies
in
sand
with
the
same
preliminary
that
has
been
so
much
speculated
about
we
always
make
a
bed
for
them
when
it
is
very
cold
by
cutting
and
stripping
a
few
spruce
boughs
and
they
highly
appreciate
such
a
couch
and
will
growl
and
fight
if
another
dog
try
to
take
it
they
need
more
food
and
particularly
they
need
more
fat
when
they
lie
out
at
extreme
low
temperatures
and
we
seek
to
increase
that
element
in
their
rations
by
adding
tallow
or
bacon
or
or
seal
oil
or
whatever
oleaginous
substance
we
can
come
by
sidenote
canine
character
he
was
a
most
independent
dog
was
nanook
a
thoroughly
bad
dog
as
one
would
say
in
some
use
of
that
term
a
thief
who
had
no
shame
in
his
thievery
but
rather
gloried
in
it
if
you
left
anything
edible
within
his
ingenious
and
comprehensive
reach
he
regarded
it
as
a
challenge
there
comes
to
me
a
ludicrous
incident
that
concerned
a
companion
of
one
winter
journey
he
had
carefully
prepared
a
lunch
and
had
wrapped
it
neatly
in
paper
and
he
placed
it
for
a
moment
on
the
sled
while
he
turned
to
put
his
scarf
about
him
but
in
that
moment
nanook
saw
it
and
it
was
gone
through
the
snow
over
the
brush
in
and
out
amongst
the
stumps
the
chase
proceeded
until
nanook
was
finally
caught
and
my
companion
recovered
most
of
the
paper
for
the
dog
had
wolfed
the
grub
as
he
ran
he
would
stand
and
take
any
licking
you
offered
and
never
utter
a
sound
but
give
a
bark
of
defiance
when
you
were
done
and
he
would
bear
you
no
ill
will
in
the
world
and
repeat
his
offence
at
the
next
opportunity
yet
so
absurdly
sensitive
was
he
in
other
matters
of
his
person
that
the
simple
operation
of
clipping
the
hair
from
between
his
toes
to
prevent
the
of
the
snow
took
two
men
to
perform
one
to
sit
on
the
dog
and
the
other
to
ply
the
scissors
and
was
accompanied
always
with
such
howls
and
squeals
as
would
make
a
hearer
think
we
were
flaying
him
alive
nanook
acquaintance
with
horses
began
in
fairbanks
the
first
season
i
owned
him
before
i
had
had
the
harness
upon
him
when
he
was
rising
two
years
old
the
dogs
and
i
were
staying
at
the
hospital
we
had
just
established
because
in
those
days
there
was
nowhere
else
to
stay
waiting
for
the
winter
one
of
the
mining
magnates
of
the
infancy
of
the
camp
broken
and
dead
long
since
bret
harte
lines
busted
himself
in
white
pine
and
blew
out
his
brains
down
in
often
occur
to
me
as
the
sordid
histories
of
repeat
those
of
fifty
years
ago
had
imported
a
and
as
the
mild
days
of
that
charming
autumn
still
deferred
the
snow
he
used
to
ride
out
past
the
hospital
for
a
canter
the
dog
had
learned
to
lift
the
latch
of
the
gate
of
the
hospital
yard
with
his
nose
and
get
out
and
when
i
put
a
wedge
above
the
latch
for
greater
security
he
learned
also
to
circumvent
that
precaution
and
whenever
the
horse
and
his
rider
passed
nanook
would
open
the
gate
and
lead
the
whole
pack
in
a
noisy
pursuit
that
changed
the
canter
to
a
run
and
brought
us
natural
but
mortifying
remonstrance
the
rider
had
just
passed
and
the
dogs
had
pursued
as
usual
and
i
had
rushed
out
and
recalled
them
with
difficulty
nanook
i
had
by
the
collar
dragging
him
into
the
yard
shutting
the
gate
and
putting
in
the
wedge
i
picked
up
a
stick
and
gave
him
a
few
sharp
blows
with
it
then
flinging
him
off
i
said
now
you
stay
in
here
i
give
you
a
sound
thrashing
if
you
do
that
again
i
was
just
getting
acquainted
with
him
then
the
moment
i
loosed
his
collar
the
dog
went
deliberately
to
the
gate
stood
on
his
hind
legs
while
he
pulled
out
the
wedge
with
his
teeth
lifted
the
latch
with
his
nose
and
swung
open
the
gate
and
standing
in
the
midst
turned
round
and
said
to
me
it
was
so
pointed
that
a
who
had
paused
to
see
the
proceedings
and
was
leaning
on
the
fence
said
to
me
well
you
know
where
can
go
to
that
the
doggonedest
dog
i
ever
seen
sidenote
partners
it
was
a
pleasure
to
come
back
to
nanook
after
any
long
absence
a
pleasure
i
was
used
to
look
forward
to
there
was
no
special
fawning
or
demonstration
of
affection
he
was
not
that
kind
that
i
might
have
from
any
of
the
others
but
from
none
but
nanook
the
bark
of
welcome
with
my
particular
inflection
in
it
that
no
one
else
ever
got
well
well
here
the
boss
again
glad
to
see
you
back
that
was
about
all
it
said
for
he
was
a
most
independent
dog
and
took
to
himself
an
air
of
partnership
rather
than
subjection
any
man
can
make
friends
with
any
dog
if
he
will
there
is
no
question
about
that
but
it
takes
a
long
time
and
mutual
trust
and
mutual
forbearance
and
mutual
appreciation
to
make
a
partnership
not
every
dog
is
fit
to
be
partner
with
a
man
nor
every
man
i
think
fit
to
be
partner
with
a
dog
well
that
long
partnership
was
dissolved
by
the
horse
hoof
and
i
was
sore
for
its
dissolution
there
was
none
left
now
that
could
remember
the
old
days
of
the
team
save
lingo
and
he
grew
crusty
and
somewhat
crabbed
he
was
still
the
guardian
of
the
sled
still
the
insatiable
but
he
grew
more
and
more
unsocial
with
his
mates
and
we
heard
his
short
sharp
angry
double
bark
at
night
more
frequently
than
we
used
to
he
reminded
me
of
the
complaining
owl
in
gray
elegy
he
resented
any
dog
even
approaching
the
sled
resented
the
dogs
moving
about
at
all
to
disturb
his
ancient
solitary
reign
his
work
was
done
and
old
lingo
had
honestly
earned
his
rest
with
the
end
of
this
winter
he
would
enter
upon
the
easy
old
age
that
i
had
designed
for
both
of
them
lingo
had
never
failed
me
never
let
his
traces
slack
if
he
could
keep
them
taut
never
in
his
life
had
whip
laid
on
his
back
to
make
him
pull
a
faithful
old
work
dog
for
whom
i
had
a
hearty
respect
and
regard
but
he
never
found
his
way
to
my
heart
as
nanook
did
i
loved
nanook
and
had
lost
something
personal
out
of
my
life
in
losing
him
there
are
other
dogs
that
i
am
fond
of
better
dogs
in
some
ways
that
either
nanook
or
lingo
swifter
certainly
but
i
think
i
shall
never
have
two
dogs
again
that
have
meant
as
much
to
me
as
these
two
all
the
other
dogs
were
of
the
last
two
years
and
thought
they
belonged
to
arthur
who
fed
them
and
handled
them
most
but
nanook
and
lingo
had
seen
boys
come
and
boys
go
and
they
knew
better
six
years
is
not
very
much
of
a
man
life
but
it
is
all
a
dog
life
all
his
effective
working
life
nanook
had
given
it
all
to
me
willingly
gladly
he
pulled
so
freely
because
he
loved
to
pull
he
delighted
in
the
winter
in
the
snow
and
the
cold
rejoiced
to
be
on
the
trail
rejoiced
to
work
when
we
made
ready
to
depart
after
a
few
days
at
a
mission
or
in
a
town
nanook
was
beside
himself
with
joy
he
would
burst
forth
into
song
as
he
saw
the
preparations
in
hand
would
run
all
up
and
down
the
gamut
of
his
singular
flexible
voice
would
tell
as
plainly
to
all
around
as
though
he
spoke
it
in
english
and
indian
and
esquimau
that
the
inaction
had
irked
him
that
he
was
eager
to
be
gone
again
well
he
was
dead
as
fine
a
dog
as
ever
lived
as
faithful
and
intelligent
a
creature
as
any
man
ever
had
not
of
human
race
for
servant
companion
and
friend
and
i
thought
the
more
of
myself
that
he
had
put
his
tongue
to
my
cheek
when
i
said
to
him
sidenote
the
amateur
photographer
here
on
the
tanana
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
original
characters
of
the
many
in
the
land
an
old
inhabitant
of
alaska
and
of
the
northwest
who
had
followed
many
avocations
and
was
now
settled
down
on
the
river
bank
with
a
steamboat
a
for
the
entertainment
of
occasional
travellers
and
a
little
stock
of
trade
goods
chiefly
for
indians
of
the
vicinity
a
round
fat
pursy
man
he
was
past
the
middle
life
with
a
twinkling
eye
and
a
bristling
moustache
and
a
most
amazing
knack
of
picking
up
new
words
and
using
them
incorrectly
he
had
fallen
out
with
the
great
trading
company
of
alaska
and
did
almost
all
his
purchasing
from
a
house
in
chicago
the
enormous
quarto
catalogue
on
the
flimsiest
thin
paper
issued
by
that
establishment
being
his
chief
book
of
reference
and
his
choice
continual
reading
he
would
declaim
by
the
hour
on
the
iniquitous
prices
that
prevail
in
the
interior
and
had
the
quotations
of
prices
of
every
conceivable
merchandise
from
his
at
his
ends
but
his
chief
passion
of
the
past
two
or
three
years
was
photography
in
the
which
he
had
made
but
little
progress
despite
considerable
expenditures
and
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
about
the
time
of
our
visit
that
what
he
needed
was
a
fine
lens
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
never
learned
to
use
his
cheap
one
he
had
recently
become
acquainted
with
sensitive
film
and
had
ordered
a
supply
by
a
transposition
of
letters
which
the
nature
of
the
substance
doubtless
confirmed
in
his
mind
when
it
arrived
he
always
spoke
of
these
convenient
strips
of
celluloid
as
flims
and
was
just
now
most
eloquently
indignant
that
although
he
had
broken
utterly
with
the
northern
commercial
company
and
refused
to
trade
with
them
at
all
the
supply
of
flims
he
had
received
from
the
house
were
labelled
them
blamed
monopolists
has
cornered
the
flims
he
exclaimed
and
was
hardly
persuaded
that
the
letters
signified
and
did
not
darkly
hint
at
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
he
produced
and
displayed
a
number
of
pieces
of
apparatus
of
a
generally
useless
kind
which
he
had
ordered
on
the
strength
of
their
much
advertising
and
he
observed
sententiously
we
get
badly
imposed
upon
here
were
patent
gimcrack
printing
devices
although
he
had
scarce
anything
worth
printing
all
sorts
of
atrocious
fancy
borders
with
which
he
sought
in
vain
to
embellish
orthochromatic
filters
and
colour
screens
with
which
he
was
eliminating
undesirable
rays
although
the
chief
thing
his
negatives
lacked
was
light
of
any
kind
his
soiled
and
stained
development
trays
were
scattered
about
a
large
table
amidst
dirty
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
and
dishes
while
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
surmounting
a
pile
of
thumbed
and
greasy
magazines
and
newspapers
lay
the
monstrous
catalogue
with
pencilled
indications
of
further
apparatus
to
be
purchased
but
his
zeal
and
enthusiasm
and
resolute
riding
of
his
hobby
were
very
attractive
if
he
ever
gets
out
of
his
head
the
notion
that
success
depends
upon
apparatus
he
will
doubtless
become
a
photographer
of
sorts
enthusiasm
of
any
kind
other
than
mining
and
mushing
enthusiasm
is
so
rare
in
this
land
that
it
is
welcome
even
when
it
seems
wasted
he
had
recently
discovered
the
wax
match
in
his
catalogue
and
as
a
parting
gift
he
presented
me
with
a
box
of
them
there
wax
which
beats
the
sulphur
match
all
to
thunder
sidenote
the
sulphur
match
but
they
do
not
nothing
in
this
country
can
take
the
place
of
the
sulphur
match
long
since
banished
from
civilised
communities
and
the
sulphur
match
is
the
only
match
a
man
upon
the
trail
will
employ
manufactured
from
blocks
of
wood
without
complete
severance
so
that
the
ends
of
the
matches
are
still
held
together
at
the
bottom
in
one
solid
mass
it
is
easy
to
strip
one
off
at
need
and
strike
it
upon
the
block
a
block
of
a
hundred
such
matches
will
take
up
much
less
space
than
fifty
of
any
other
kind
of
match
and
the
blocks
may
be
freely
carried
in
any
as
they
are
commonly
carried
in
every
pocket
without
fear
of
accidental
ignition
the
only
fire
producer
that
it
is
worth
while
supplementing
the
sulphur
match
with
is
the
even
flint
and
steel
which
to
a
man
who
smokes
is
a
convenience
in
a
wind
all
the
modern
alcohol
and
gasoline
pocket
devices
are
extinguished
by
the
lightest
puff
of
wind
but
the
tinder
once
ignited
burns
the
fiercer
for
the
blast
with
dry
shredded
i
have
made
a
fire
upon
occasion
from
the
flint
and
steel
one
resource
may
here
be
mentioned
since
we
are
on
the
subject
which
is
always
carried
in
the
of
my
sled
against
difficulty
in
fire
making
it
is
a
tin
filled
with
strips
of
cotton
cloth
cut
to
the
size
of
the
box
and
the
whole
saturated
with
kerosene
one
or
two
of
these
strips
will
help
very
greatly
in
kindling
a
fire
when
damp
twigs
or
shavings
are
all
that
are
at
hand
a
few
camphor
balls
the
ordinary
moth
balls
will
serve
equally
well
and
there
may
come
a
time
on
any
long
journey
when
the
forethought
that
has
provided
such
aid
will
be
looked
back
upon
with
very
great
satisfaction
the
mail
trail
from
tanana
to
fairbanks
touches
the
tanana
river
only
at
one
point
a
few
miles
beyond
the
hot
springs
but
as
we
wished
to
visit
nenana
we
had
to
leave
the
mail
trail
after
two
days
more
of
uneventful
travel
and
strike
out
to
the
river
and
over
its
surface
for
seventeen
or
eighteen
miles
sidenote
a
notable
gentlewoman
nenana
is
a
native
village
situated
on
the
left
bank
of
the
tanana
a
little
above
the
confluence
of
the
nenana
river
with
that
stream
and
we
have
established
an
important
and
flourishing
school
there
which
receives
its
forty
pupils
from
many
points
on
the
yukon
and
tanana
rivers
none
but
thoroughly
sound
and
healthy
children
of
promise
full
natives
or
are
received
at
the
school
and
we
seek
to
give
both
boys
and
girls
opportunity
for
the
cultivation
of
the
native
arts
and
for
some
of
the
white
man
industrial
training
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
work
of
the
schoolroom
the
school
was
started
and
had
the
good
fortune
of
its
first
four
years
life
under
the
care
of
a
notable
gentlewoman
miss
annie
cragg
farthing
who
was
yet
at
its
head
at
the
time
of
this
visit
but
who
died
suddenly
a
martyr
to
her
devotion
to
the
children
a
year
later
and
a
great
celtic
cross
in
concrete
standing
high
on
the
bluff
across
the
river
now
marks
the
spot
of
her
own
selection
a
spot
that
gives
a
fine
view
of
denali
where
her
body
rests
and
also
the
alaskan
mission
sense
of
the
extraordinary
value
of
her
life
it
would
be
easy
to
give
striking
instances
of
the
potency
and
stretch
of
this
remarkable
woman
influence
amongst
the
native
people
an
influence
strange
as
it
may
sound
to
those
who
deem
any
white
woman
competent
to
take
charge
of
an
indian
school
due
as
much
to
her
wide
culture
her
perfect
dignity
and
her
high
breeding
as
to
the
love
and
consecrated
enthusiasm
of
her
character
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
miss
farthing
work
has
left
a
mark
broad
and
deep
upon
the
indian
race
of
this
whole
region
that
will
never
be
wiped
out
there
is
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
spend
a
few
days
at
this
school
to
foregather
again
with
so
many
of
the
hopeful
young
scamps
that
one
has
oneself
selected
here
and
there
and
brought
to
the
place
to
mark
the
improvement
in
them
the
taming
and
gentling
the
drawing
out
of
the
sweet
side
of
the
nature
that
is
commonly
buried
to
the
casual
observer
in
the
rudeness
and
shyness
of
savage
childhood
to
romp
with
them
to
tell
them
tales
and
jingles
to
get
insensibly
back
into
their
familiar
confidence
again
to
say
the
evening
prayers
with
them
to
join
with
their
clear
fresh
voices
in
the
hymns
and
chants
is
indeed
to
rejuvenate
oneself
and
to
go
away
believing
that
real
strength
of
character
is
developing
that
real
preparation
is
making
for
an
indian
race
that
shall
be
a
better
indian
race
and
not
an
imitation
white
race
is
the
cure
for
the
discouragement
that
must
sometimes
come
to
all
those
who
are
committed
heart
and
soul
to
the
cause
of
the
alaskan
native
it
would
seem
ought
never
to
grow
old
they
should
suck
in
new
youth
continually
from
the
young
life
around
them
and
children
are
far
and
away
the
most
interesting
things
in
the
world
more
interesting
even
than
dogs
and
great
mountains
sidenote
chivalrous
indian
youth
all
the
boys
in
the
school
i
think
swarmed
across
the
river
with
us
when
we
started
away
early
in
the
morning
and
the
elder
ones
ran
with
the
sled
along
the
portage
mile
after
mile
until
i
turned
them
back
lest
they
be
late
for
school
but
when
they
were
gone
still
i
saw
them
saw
them
gathered
round
the
lady
i
had
left
fawning
upon
her
with
their
eyes
their
hearts
filled
with
as
true
chivalry
as
ever
animated
knight
or
champion
of
the
olden
time
tall
upstanding
fellows
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
and
all
their
lives
hunters
with
a
tale
of
big
game
to
the
credit
of
some
of
them
would
make
an
english
sportsman
envious
unaccustomed
to
any
restraint
at
all
and
prone
to
chafe
at
the
slightest
unaccustomed
to
any
respect
for
women
to
any
of
the
courtesies
of
life
i
saw
them
fly
at
a
word
at
a
look
to
do
her
bidding
saw
cap
snatched
from
head
if
they
encountered
her
about
the
buildings
saw
them
jump
up
and
hold
open
the
door
if
she
moved
to
pass
out
of
a
room
saw
the
eager
devotion
that
would
have
served
her
upon
bended
knee
had
they
thought
it
would
please
her
it
was
wonderful
the
only
thing
of
quite
its
kind
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
when
early
in
the
school
history
an
old
at
nenana
had
been
roused
to
animosity
by
her
refusal
to
countenance
an
offensive
indian
custom
touching
the
adolescent
girls
and
had
defiantly
announced
his
intention
to
make
medicine
against
her
i
can
see
her
now
her
staff
in
her
hand
attended
by
two
or
three
of
her
devoted
youths
invading
the
midnight
pavilion
of
the

across

driving
the
gaping

their
awe

overawed
by
her
commanding

i
make
no
apology
that
i
thought
of
the
scourge
of
small
cords
that
was
used
on
an
occasion
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
when
i
heard
of
it
it
gave
a
shrewder
blow
to
the
lingering
tyrannical
superstition
of
the
than
decades
of
preaching
and
reasoning
would
have
done
no
man
living
could
have
done
the
thing
with
like
effect
nor
any
woman

one
of
her
complete
and
natural
authority
the
younger
villagers
chuckle
over
the
jest
of
it
to
this
day
and
the
old
himself
was
crouching
at
her
feet
and
as
one
may
say
eating
out
of
her
hand
within
the
year
i
saw
these
boys
again
in
my
mind
eye
gone
back
to
their
homes
here
and
there
on
the
yukon
and
the
tanana
after
their
two
or
three
years
at
this
school
carrying
with
them
some
better
ideal
of
human
life
than
they
could
ever
get
from
the
elders
of
the
tribe
from
the
little
sordid
village
trader
from
most
of
the
whites
they
would
be
thrown
with
keeping
something
of
the
vision
of
gentle
womanhood
something
of
the
unbought
grace
of
life
something
of
the
keen
sense
of
truth
and
honour
of
the
nobility
of
service
something
deeper
and
stronger
than
mere
words
of
the
love
of
god
which
they
had
learned
of
her
whom
they
all
revered
each
one
however
much
overflowed
again
by
the
surrounding
waters
of
mere
animal
living
tending
a
little
shrine
of
sweeter
and
better
things
in
his
heart
sidenote
teaching
here
three
years
after
the
visit
and
the
journey
narrated
when
these
words
are
written
with
diaries
and
letters
and
memoranda
around
me
i
am
just
come
from
a
long
native
powwow
a
meeting
of
all
the
indians
of
a
village
for
the
annual
election
of
a
village
council
important
in
the
evolution
of
that
we
covet
for
these
people
but
undeniably
tedious
and
because
at
our
missions
we
seek
to
associate
with
us
every
force
that
looks
to
the
betterment
of
the
natives
we
had
invited
the
new
government
teacher
a
lady
of
long
experience
in
indian
schools
to
be
present
she
had
sat
patiently
through
the
protracted
meeting
and
at
its
close
when
she
rose
to
go
a
young
indian
man
jumped
up
and
held
her
fur
cloak
for
her
and
put
it
gently
about
her
shoulders
when
she
had
thanked
him
she
asked
with
a
smile
where
did
you
learn
to
be
so
polite
a
gleam
came
into
the
fellow
eyes
then
he
dropped
them
and
replied
miss
farthing
taught
me
two
days
before
returning
from
a
journey
i
had
spent
the
night
at
a
kept
by
a
white
man
married
to
an
indian
woman
there
was
excellent
yeast
bread
on
the
table
and
good
bread
is
a
rare
thing
in
alaska
where
did
you
learn
to
make
such
good
bread
i
inquired
of
the
woman
there
came
the
same
light
to
her
eyes
and
the
same
answer
to
her
lips
yet
it
was
nine
years
ago
long
before
the
school
at
nenana
was
started
that
this
indian
boy
and
girl
had
been
under
miss
teaching
at
circle
city
they
tell
us
there
is
no
longer
much
place
or
use
for
gentility
in
the
world
for
men
and
women
nurtured
and
refined
above
the
common
level
tell
us
in
particular
that
woman
is
only
now
emancipating
herself
from
centuries
of
ineffectual
nonage
only
now
entering
upon
her
active
career
yet
i
am
of
opinion
from
such
opportunities
to
observe
and
compare
as
my
constant
travel
has
given
me
that
the
quiet
work
of
this
gracious
woman
of
the
old
school
with
her
dignity
that
nothing
ever
invaded
and
her
poise
that
nothing
ever
disturbed
is
perhaps
the
most
powerful
single
influence
that
has
come
into
the
lives
of
the
natives
of
interior
alaska
two
days
brought
us
past
the
little
native
village
and
mission
at
chena
which
is
pronounced
past
the
little
white
town
of
the
same
name
to
fairbanks
the
chief
town
of
interior
alaska
chena
is
at
the
virtual
head
of
the
navigation
of
the
tanana
river
and
is
quite
as
near
to
the
creeks
as
fairbanks
which
latter
place
is
not
on
the
tanana
river
at
all
but
on
a
slough
impracticable
for
almost
any
craft
at
low
water
for
every
topographical
reason
from
every
consideration
of
natural
advantage
chena
should
have
been
the
river
port
and
town
of
these
but
chena
was
so
sure
of
her
manifold
natural
advantages
that
she
became
unduly
confident
and
grasping
when
the
traders
at
fairbanks
offered
to
remove
to
chena
at
the
beginning
of
the
camp
if
the
traders
at
chena
would
provide
a
site
the
offer
was
scornfully
rejected
they
would
have
to
come
anyway
or
go
out
of
business
but
they
did
not
come
rather
they
put
their
backs
up
and
fought
and
because
fairbanks
was
enterprising
and
while
chena
was
avaricious
and
narrow
because
fairbanks
offered
free
sites
and
chena
charged
enormously
for
business
went
the
ten
miles
up
the
often
unnavigable
slough
and
settled
there
and
by
and
by
built
a
little
railway
that
it
might
be
independent
of
the
uncertain
boat
service
the
company
came
the
courts
came
the
hospital
came
the
churches
came
and
chena
woke
up
from
its
dreams
of
easy
wealth
to
find
itself
and
its
manifold
natural
advantages
passed
by
and
ignored
and
the
big
town
firmly
established
elsewhere
how
well
i
remember
the
virulent
little
newspaper
published
at
chena
in
those
days
and
the
bitterness
and
vituperation
it
used
to
pour
out
week
by
week
one
wishes
a
file
of
it
had
been
preserved
alaskan
journalism
has
presented
many
amusing
curiosities
that
no
one
has
had
leisure
to
collect
but
nothing
more
amusing
than
the
frenzy
of
impotent
wrath
chena
vented
when
it
saw
its
cherished
prospects
and
opportunities
slipping
out
of
its
grasp
for
ever
if
of
all
words
on
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
might
have
been
full
sad
are
those
we
often
see
it
is
but
it
had
ought
to
be
it
takes
bret
harte
to
strike
the
note
for
such
rivalry
and
such
disappointment

c
in
december
a
determined
effort
was
made
by
the
better
element
of
the
little
handful
of
white
people
in
this
town
to
secure
the
withdrawal
of
the
licence
of
this
saloon
the
justice
of
the
peace
the
government
the
postmaster
and
others
went
up
to
fairbanks
a
week
journey
over
the
trail
and
opposed
the
granting
of
the
licence
in
court
it
was
shown
that
the
white
men
of
the
locality
were
so
reduced
in
numbers
that
the
business
could
not
be
carried
on
at
a
profit
unless
liquor
was
sold
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
indians
but
because
by
hook
and
by
crook
the
names
of
a
majority
of
one
or
two
of
all
the
white
residents
of
the
precinct
were
secured
for
a
petition
in
favour
of
the
licence
two
or
three
were
secured
by
telegraph
at
the
last
moment
the
judge
held
that
he
had
no
option
under
the
law
but
to
grant
the
licence
so
on
the
one
hand
it
is
a
felony
to
sell
liquor
to
indians
and
annually
thousands
of
dollars
are
expended
in
trying
to
suppress
such
sale
while
on
the
other
hand
a
man
is
licenced
to
sell
liquor
when
it
is
shown
that
he
can
not
make
a
living
unless
he
sells
to
indians
that
is
to
say
he
is
virtually
granted
a
licence
to
sell
to
indians
this
note
is
not
intended
to
reflect
upon
the
judge
who
granted
the
licence
although
all
his
predecessors
have
not
put
that
construction
upon
the
law

upon

steady
decline
in

drop

from
twenty
millions
down

five
there
is
little

all
over

there
is
no
marked
visible
diminution
in

as
a
matter

both

largely
fallen
off
the
thing
that
more
than
any
other
has
sustained
the
spirits
and
retained
the
presence
of

men
is
the
expectation
that
seems
to
grow
brighter
and
brighter
of
the
development
of
a
quartz
camp
now
that
the
placers
are
being
exhausted
and
in
that
hope
lies
the
chance
of
fairbanks
to
become
the
one
permanent
considerable
town
of

it
is
a
substantial
place
with
good
business
houses
and
many
comfortable
homes
well
protected
against

better
than
against

and
though
it
does
not
display
the
style
and
luxury
of
the
palmy
days
of

it
has
amenities
enough
to
make
disinterested
visitors

wish
that
its
hopes
may
be
realised

of

in

season
we
had
another
canine
misfortune
while
we
lay
there
doc
one
of
our
leaders
got
his
chain
twisted
around
his
foot
the
night
before
we
were
to
leave
and
in
pulling
to
free
it
stopped
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
the
foot
froze
it
was
as
hard
as
wood
and
sounded
like
wood
when
it
hit
the
sidewalks
from
which
the
snow
had
been
cleared
as
the
dog
came
limping
along
an
hour
soaking
in
cold
water
drew
the
frost
out
of
the
foot
and
we
swathed
it
in
cotton
saturated
with
carron
oil
upon
which
it
swelled
so
greatly
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
extent
of
the
injury
or
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
dog
would
ever
be
of
use
again
a
kindly
nurse
at
the
hospital
undertook
his
care
and
we
left
him
behind
one
does
not
buy
a
dog
so
late
in
the
season
with
all
the
idle
summer
to
feed
him
through
if
any
shift
can
be
made
to
avoid
it
and
there
was
a
great
dane
pup
at
the
salchaket
forty
miles
away
that
i
might
pick
up
as
i
passed
and
perhaps
make
some
use
of
for
the
remainder
of
the
winter
that
mission
was
the
next
stop
on
our
journey
and
we
reached
it
over

of

of

established
by
the
energy
and
zeal
of
the
reverend
charles
eugene
betticher
during
his
incumbency
at
fairbanks
that
have
already
brought
a
great
change
for
the
better
in
native
conditions
five
years
had
elapsed
since
last
i
visited
this
tribe
a
reconnoitring
visit
on
one
of
the
first
steamboats
that
ever
went
up
the
tanana
river
above
fairbanks
and
it
was
a
delight
to
see
the
new
clean
village
with
the
little
gardens
round
the
cabins
and
to
note
the
appreciative
attitude
which
the
indians
showed
so
highly
do
they
value
the
missionary
nurse
in
charge
that
however
far
afield
their
hunting
may
lead
them
one
of
their
number
is
sent
back
every
week
to
see
that
the
mission
does
not
lack
wood
and
water
and
meat
a
simple
docile
kindly
people
that
one
heart
warms
to
this
mission
was
our
last
outpost
to
the
south
my
farther
journey
had
for
its
prime
object
the
visiting
of
the
natives
of
the
upper
tanana
as
far
as
the
tanana
crossing
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
beyond
the
salchaket
the
inquiring
into
their
condition
and
into
the
desirability
of
establishing
a
post
amongst
them
sidenote
the
upper

the
upper
tanana
is
probably
one
of
the
most
difficult
streams
in
the
world
to
navigate
that
can
by
any
stretch
of
the
term
be
called
navigable
the
great
alaskan
range
begins
to
approach
the
tanana
river
so
soon
as
one
gets
above
fairbanks
its
prominent
peaks
ten
thousand
to
twelve
thousand
feet
high
are
continually
in
view
from
one
angle
to
another
as
one
pursues
the
river
trail
and
come
constantly
nearer
and
nearer
all
the
streams
that
are
confluent
with
the
tanana
on
its
left
bank
are
glacial
streams
draining
the
high
ice
of
these
mountains
they
come
down
laden
thick
with
silt
at
times
foaming
torrents
at
times
merely
trickling
watercourses
that
seam
with
numerous
small
runnels
the
wide
deltas
at
their
mouths
the
tributaries
of
the
right
bank
flow
for
the
most
part
through
heavily
wooded
country
and
come
out
cleanly
into
the
river
so
the
glacial
waters
form
shoals
and
bars
and
the
woodland
waters
during
freshets
pile
them
high
with
driftwood
such
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
upper
tanana
a
multiplicity
of
swift
narrow
channels
amidst
bars
laden
with
drift
it
is
subject
to
sudden
rises
of
great
violence
the
attempt
to
stem
a
freshet
on
the
upper
tanana
is
a
experience
as
the
log
of
the
would
show
but
does
not
come
within
this
narrative
owing
to
the
origin
of
much
of
its
water
the
tanana
is
often
in
flood
in
dry
hot
seasons
when
other
rivers
run
meagrely
as
well
as
in
times
of
rain
it
can
not
be
stemmed
in
flood
its
shoals
deny
passage
in
drouth
there
must
be
just
the
right
stage
of
water
to
permit
its
navigation
and
that
stage
without
full
is
not
often
found
of
duration
to
serve
the
voyage
after
the
month
of
june
a
river
difficult
to
navigate
in
summer
is
usually
a
river
difficult
to
travel
upon
in
winter
and
the
upper
tanana
is
notoriously
dangerous
and
treacherous
scarce
a
winter
or
a
summer
that
it
does
not
claim
victims
it
is
emphatically
a
bad
river
therefore
as
far
as
there
is
any
travel
to
speak
of
land
trails
parallel
the
river
past
richardson
where
the
next
night
is
spent
a
decayed
mining
and
trading
town
that
dates
back
to
the
stampedes
of
when
it
was
thought
the
upper
tanana
would
prove
rich
in
gold
past
tenderfoot
creek
on
which
the
discoveries
were
made
past
the
mouth
of
the
big
delta
with
the
great
bluff
on
the
opposite
shore
and
the
rushing
black
water
at
its
foot
that
never
entirely
closes
all
the
winter
and
on
the
other
hand
the
wide
barrens
of
the
big
delta
itself
giving
the
whole
fine
sweep
of
the
alaskan
range
we
came
at
length
to
mccarthy
the
last
telegraph
station
on
the
river
for
the
line
strikes
across
country
thence
to
valdez
following
the
government
trail
and
there
spent
another
night
and
here
we
leave
the
trail
and
take
to
the
river
surface
and
the
wilderness
illustration
a
pleasant
woodland
trail
illustration
an
alaskan
chief
and
his
henchman
twelve
miles
through
the
woods
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
brought
us
to
the
aptly
named
clearwater
creek
a
tributary
that
comes
only
from
the
and
carries
no
glacial
water
this
stream
by
reason
of
hot
springs
runs
wide
open
all
the
winter
and
must
be
crossed
by
a
ferry
a
raft
on
a
heavy
wire
the
man
who
owned
the
ferry
and
the
house
adjacent
was
gone
from
home
so
we
proceeded
to
cross
as
best
we
could
the
raft
was
so
small
that
first
we
took
the
dogs
across
then
unloaded
the
sled
and
took
part
of
the
load
and
returned
for
the
remainder
and
the
sled
itself
finally
a
canoe
was
loaded
on
the
raft
and
when
it
had
been
moored
on
the
side
we
found
it
arthur
paddled
himself
back
it
was
a
strange
scene
rafting
and
paddling
a
canoe
in
interior
alaska
on
the
of
march
with
the
thermometer
at
some
eight
miles
farther
along
the
portage
trail
we
came
to
a
little
cabin
about
dusk
but
disdaining
its
dirt
and
darkness
we
pitched
our
tent
another
eighteen
miles
the
next
day
is
noted
in
my
diary
for
pleasant
woodland
travel
and
for
the
particular
interest
of
the
numerous
animal
tracks
we
passed
here
a
moose
had
crossed
the
trail
ploughing
through
the
snow
like
a
great
here
for
two
or
three
miles
a
lynx
had
urgent
business
in
the
direction
of
the
healy
river
a
lynx
will
always
follow
a
trail
if
there
be
one
and
will
pick
out
the
best
going
on
the
ice
or
snow
in
the
absence
of
trail
i
once
followed
a
lynx
track
from
the
head
of
the
dall
river
to
its
mouth
and
save
for
turning
aside
occasionally
to
investigate
a
clump
of
willows
or
brush
the
lynx
was
an
excellent
guide
here
were
rabbit
tracks
and
every
now
and
then
the
little
sharp
tracks
of
a
squirrel
we
stopped
for
lunch
under
a
tall
and
arthur
pointed
out
that
the
trunk
up
to
a
high
crotch
was
all
seamed
by
bear
claws
he
said
that
the
black
bear
climbed
the
same
tree
season
after
season
and
told
me
that
according
to
the
indians
this
was
chiefly
done
when
first
he
came
from
his
winter
den
for
the
purpose
of
getting
his
bearings
as
the
boy
suggested
with
a
chuckle
a
fox
a
marten
and
a
weasel
had
all
passed
across
lately
and
of
course
then
came
the
exclamation
that
scarce
fails
from
native
lips
when
a
fox
track
is
seen
i
wonder
if
it
were
a
black
fox
a
black
fox
means
sudden
wealth
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
to
an
indian
and
any
fox
track
may
be
the
track
of
a
black
fox
the
end
of
that
portage
brought
us
out
on
the
tanana
river
opposite
the
little
at
the
mouth
of
the
healy
the
last
post
of
any
kind
we
should
see
sidenote
indian
traders
the
trader
by
whom
we
were
hospitably
entertained
had
heard
of
our
projected
occupation
of
the
upper
tanana
and
alert
to
his
own
interests
was
anxious
to
know
the
plans
for
the
establishment
of
a
mission
plans
which
were
yet
all
to
make
he
naturally
favoured
this
spot
which
it
was
already
plain
was
quite
out
of
the
question
but
professed
his
readiness
to
move
to
any
place
that
we
might
decide
upon
and
his
entire
sympathy
and
the
question
of
the
trader
which
always
arises
upon
the
establishment
of
a
new
mission
site
is
an
important
and
sometimes
a
vexatious
one
for
he
wields
an
influence
amongst
the
indians
second
only
to
that
of
the
mission
itself
and
may
be
either
a
great
help
or
a
great
hindrance
there
is
a
natural
desire
to
secure
a
man
of
character
for
the
new
post
and
at
the
same
time
a
natural
reluctance
to
disturb
vested
interests
and
arouse
bitter
enmity
by
diverting
trade
the
suggestion
has
often
been
made
that
the
mission
should
itself
undertake
a
store
in
the
interest
of
the
natives
but
those
with
most
experience
in
such
matters
will
agree
that
it
is
the
wisdom
of
the
bishop
that
sets
his
face
against
mission
trading
the
two
offices
are
so
essentially
dissimilar
as
to
be
almost
incompatible
with
one
another
either
the
person
in
charge
is
a
missionary
first
and
a
trader
afterwards
in
which
case
the
store
suffers
or
he
is
a
trader
first
and
a
missionary
afterwards
in
which
case
he
is
not
a
missionary
at
all
a
clean
sober
and
honest
trader
content
to
take
his
time
about
getting
rich
is
a
blessing
to
an
indian
community
there
are
some
such
one
thinks
but
they
are
not
numerous
the
profits
are
large
though
the
turnover
is
but
one
a
year
the
capital
required
is
small
it
is
a
life
with
much
leisure
but
in
the
main
it
attracts
only
a
certain
class
of
men
a
band
of
indians
to
whom
word
of
our
visit
had
been
sent
had
come
down
the
river
this
far
to
meet
us
and
escort
us
but
dog
food
was
scarce
and
our
arrival
was
delayed
and
they
had
been
compelled
to
return
to
their
hunting
camp
whither
we
must
follow
them
we
were
now
farther
up
the
tanana
river
than
either
of
us
had
ever
been
before
the
country
had
the
fascination
of
a
new
country
every
bend
of
the
river
held
unknown
possibilities
and
the
keenness
and
elation
that
only
the
penetration
of
a
new
country
brings
were
upon
the
boy
as
well
as
upon
myself
the
river
and
the
mountains
were
already
drawn
much
closer
together
and
as
we
pursued
our
journey
upon
the
one
we
had
continual
fine
views
of
the
other
the
going
was
good
too
good
for
much
of
it
was
new
ice
and
spoke
of
recent
overflow
and
all
too
soon
we
came
upon
the
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
johnson
river
one
of
the
glacial
streams
the
whole
river
was
overflowed
and
we
waded
for
a
mile
through
water
that
deepened
continually
until
there
was
risk
of
wetting
our
load
then
we
were
compelled
to
take
to
the
woods
and
to
cut
a
portage
around
the
worst
and
deepest
of
it
and
so
passed
beyond
it
to
good
ice
and
to
an
empty
cabin
where
we
spent
the
night
glad
to
be
sheltered
from
an
exceedingly
bitter
wind
that
had
blown
all
day
and
had
taken
all
the
pleasure
out
of
travel
sidenote
the
thermos
bottles
it
is
in
such
weather
particularly
that
the
thermos
flasks
prove
such
a
boon
to
the
musher
to
stop
and
build
a
fire
in
the
wind
means
to
get
chilled
through
there
is
no
pleasure
in
it
at
all
and
i
would
rather
push
on
until
the
day
journey
is
done
but
the
native
boy
must
have
his
lunch
and
will
build
a
fire
in
any
sort
of
weather
and
make
a
pot
of
tea
the
thermos
bottle
with
its
cocoa
gives
one
the
stimulation
and
nourishment
that
are
desired
without
stopping
for
more
than
a
few
moments
i
have
carried
a
pair
of
these
bottles
all
day
at
below
zero
and
when
opened
snow
had
to
be
put
into
the
cocoa
before
it
was
cool
enough
to
drink
of
course
it
is
perfectly
simple
all
the
astonishing
things
are
but
i
never
open
one
of
those
bottles
in
the
cold
weather
and
pour
out
its
contents
without
marvelling
at
it
we
left
the
river
and
struck
inland
towards
the
of
the
alaskan
range
a
long
rough
journey
over
a
trail
that
had
been
made
by
the
band
that
came
out
to
the
healy
to
meet
us
and
had
been
travelled
no
more
than
by
their
coming
and
going
the
snow
in
this
region
had
been
as
much
lighter
than
usual
as
the
snow
in
the
koyukuk
had
been
heavier
through
the
tangle
of
prostrate
trunks
of
a
forest
and
the
dense
underbrush
that
follows
such
a
fire
with
not
enough
snow
to
give
smooth
passage
over
the
obstacles
we
made
our
toilsome
way
the
labour
of
the
dogs
calling
for
the
continual
supplement
of
the
men
one
at
the
gee
pole
and
one
at
the
some
twenty
miles
perhaps
a
long
day
continuous
journey
we
pushed
laboriously
into
the
hills
and
then
pitched
our
tent
but
in
a
few
miles
next
morning
we
had
struck
the
main
indian
trail
from
the
village
near
the
tanana
crossing
by
which
the
hunting
party
had
come
and
what
little
was
left
of
the
journey
went
easily
enough
until
we
reached
the
considerable
native
encampment
the
men
were
all
gone
after
moose
save
one
old
paralytic
a
dreadful
creature
who
shambled
and
hobbled
up
asking
for
tobacco
the
women
were
expecting
us
however
and
took
the
encamping
out
of
our
hands
entirely
setting
up
the
tent
hauling
stove
wood
and
splitting
it
up
making
our
couch
of
spruce
boughs
starting
a
fire
and
bringing
a
plentiful
present
of
moose
and
caribou
meat
for
ourselves
and
our
dogs
nothing
could
have
been
kinder
than
our
reception
the
full
hospitality
of
the
wilderness
was
heaped
upon
us
it
was
not
until
dark
that
the
men
returned
and
we
had
all
the
afternoon
to
get
acquainted
with
the
women
and
children
already
the
chief
difficulty
we
had
to
encounter
presented
itself
these
people
did
not
speak
the
language
of
the
lower
tanana
and
middle
yukon
arthur
language
at
all
their
speech
had
much
more
affinity
with
the
upper
yukon
language
and
it
dawned
upon
me
that
they
were
not
of
the
migration
that
had
pushed
up
the
tanana
river
from
the
yukon
as
all
the
natives
as
far
as
the
salchaket
certainly
did
were
not
of
that
tribe
or
that
movement
at
all
but
had
come
across
country
by
the
ketchumstock
from
the
neighbourhood
of
eagle
the
route
we
should
return
to
the
yukon
by
and
were
of
the
porcupine
and
peel
river
stock
this
was
certainly
a
surprise
i
had
deemed
all
the
tanana
river
indians
of
the
same
extraction
and
tongue
but
the
stretch
of
bad
water
from
the
salchaket
to
the
tanana
crossing
was
evidently
the
boundary
between
two
peoples
sidenote
chief
isaac
that
night
we
met
chief
isaac
and
the
principal
men
of
his
tribe
at
first
it
seemed
that
such
broken
english
as
three
or
four
of
them
had
would
be
our
only
medium
of
intercourse
but
later
one
was
discovered
who
had
visited
the
lower
tanana
and
the
yukon
and
who
understood
arthur
indifferently
well
and
by
the
double
interpretation
halting
and
inefficient
but
growing
somewhat
better
as
we
proceeded
it
was
possible
to
enter
into
communication
these
preliminaries
arranged
the
chief
made
a
set
speech
of
dignity
and
force
he
thanked
me
for
coming
to
them
and
regretted
he
had
not
been
able
to
wait
longer
at
the
healy
river
to
help
us
to
his
camp
when
he
was
a
boy
he
had
been
across
to
the
yukon
and
had
seen
bishop
bompas
and
had
been
taught
and
baptized
by
him
but
he
was
an
old
man
now
and
he
had
forgotten
what
he
had
learned
i
was
the
first
minister
most
of
his
people
had
ever
seen
they
heard
that
indians
in
other
places
had
mission
and
school
and
they
had
felt
sorry
a
long
time
that
no
one
came
to
teach
them
for
they
were
very
ignorant
little
children
who
knew
nothing
and
when
they
heard
a
rumour
that
a
mission
and
school
would
be
brought
to
them
their
hearts
were
very
glad
wherever
we
should
see
fit
to
make
mission
there
he
and
his
people
would
go
and
would
help
build
for
us
and
help
us
in
every
way
but
he
hoped
it
would
be
near
lake
mansfield
and
the
crossing
where
most
of
them
lived
at
present
farther
down
the
river
was
not
so
good
for
their
hunting
and
fishing
but
they
would
go
wherever
we
said
that
was
the
burden
of
the
chief
speech
i
took
a
liking
to
the
old
man
at
once
he
was
evidently
a
chief
that
was
a
chief
the
chieftainship
here
was
plainly
not
the
effete
and
decaying
institution
it
is
in
many
places
on
the
yukon
he
spoke
for
all
his
people
without
hesitation
or
question
and
one
felt
that
what
he
said
was
law
amongst
them
there
followed
for
two
days
an
almost
continuous
course
of
instruction
in
the
elements
of
the
christian
faith
and
christian
morals
all
day
long
and
far
into
the
night
with
no
more
interval
than
cooking
and
eating
required
in
the
largest
tent
of
the
encampment
packed
full
of
men
and
women
the
children
wedged
in
where
they
could
get
myself
seated
on
a
pile
of
robes
and
skins
my
interpreters
at
my
side
my
hearers
squatted
on
the
spruce
boughs
of
the
floor
the
instruction
went
on
as
it
proceeded
the
interpretation
improved
though
it
was
still
difficult
and
clumsy
as
speaking
through
two
minds
and
two
mouths
must
always
be
whenever
i
stopped
there
was
urgent
request
to
go
on
until
at
last
my
voice
was
almost
gone
with
incessant
use
over
and
over
the
same
things
i
went
the
cardinal
facts
of
religion
the
incarnation
the
crucifixion
the
resurrection
the
ascension
the
cardinal
laws
of
morality
the
prohibition
of
murder
adultery
theft
and
falsehood
that
something
definite
might
be
left
behind
that
should
not
be
lost
in
the
vagueness
of
general
recollection
and
always
with
the
insistence
that
this
was
god
world
and
not
the
devil
world
a
world
in
which
good
should
ultimately
prevail
in
spite
of
all
opposition
sidenote
savage
heathen
pagan
it
is
at
once
a
high
privilege
and
a
solemn
responsibility
to
deal
with
souls
to
whom
the
appeal
of
the
christian
religion
had
never
before
been
made
as
were
most
of
my
hearers
one
can
not
call
them
heathen
one
never
thinks
of
these
alaskan
natives
as
heathen
savage
and
heathen
and
pagan
all
meant
of
course
in
their
origin
just
country
people
and
point
to
some
tremendous
superciliousness
of
the
long
since
disappeared
except
perhaps
from
such
places
as
whitechapel
and
the
bowery
a
savage
is
simply
a
forest
dweller
a
heathen
a
heath
dweller
and
for
a
large
part
of
each
year
i
come
etymologically
within
the
terms
myself
but
with
its
ordinary
implication
of
ferocity
and
bloodthirstiness
it
is
absurd
to
apply
the
word
savage
to
the
mild
and
gentle
alaskan
indian
and
with
its
ordinary
implication
of
bowing
down
to
wood
and
stone
it
is
misleading
to
apply
the
term
heathen
to
those
who
never
made
any
sort
of
graven
image

has
been
written
and
cleverly
written
about
the
alaskan
indian
that
is
preposterously
untrue
arthur
my
boy
had
recently
been
reading
a
story
by
jack
london
dealing
with
the
indians
in
the
vicinity
of
tanana
where
he
was
bred
and
born
and
his
indignation
at
the
representation
of
his
people
in
this
story
was
amusing
the
story
was
called
wit
of
and
it
presented
a
native
chief
in
almost
baronial
state
with
slaves
waiting
upon
him
in
a
large
banqueting
hall
and
i
know
not
what
accumulated
wealth
of
furs
and
gold
such
pictures
are
far
more
flagrantly
untrue
to
any
conditions
that
ever
existed
in
alaska
than
anything
fenimore
cooper
wrote
about
the
five
nations
there
were
never
any
slaves
in
the
interior
there
was
never
any
wealth
amongst
the
indians
there
was
never
any
state
and
circumstance
of
life
and
the
more
one
lives
amongst
them
and
knows
them
the
less
one
believes
that
they
could
ever
have
been
a
warlike
people
despite
their
own
traditions
sporadic
forays
fostered
by
their
ignorant
dread
of
one
another
or
stirred
up
by
rival
there
may
have
been
between
different
tribes
and
there
certainly
were
between
the
indians
and
the
esquimaux
with
ambuscade
and
slaughter
of
isolated
hunting
parties
that
ventured
too
far
beyond
the
confines
of
their
own
territory
and
one
such
affair
would
furnish
tradition
for
generations
to
dilate
upon
i
have
myself
found
all
the
men
of
nulato
gone
scouting
or
hiding
i
could
not
determine
which
in
the
hills
with
their
guns
upon
a
rumour
that
the
huskies
or
esquimaux
were
coming
i
have
known
the
indians
of
the
yukon
and
the
tanana
and
as
far
as
the
koyukuk
excited
and
alarmed
over
the
friendly
visit
of
a
handful
of
ragged
natives
from
the
copper
river
to
nenana
at
christmas
time
although
in
either
case
it
must
certainly
have
been
fifty
years
since
there
was
any
actual
hostile
incursion
and
probably
much
longer
sidenote
a
gentle
timid
people
they
are
a
very
timid
people
and
an
exceedingly
peaceable
people
years
and
years
may
be
spent
amongst
them
without
knowledge
of
a
single
act
of
violence
between
indian
men
they
do
not
quarrel
and
fight
bold
enough
in
the
chase
willing
to
face
dangers
of
ice
and
water
and
wild
beast
they
have
a
dread
of
anything
like
personal
encounter
and
will
submit
to
a
surprising
amount
of
imposition
and
overbearing
on
the
part
of
a
white
man
without
resorting
to
it
i
knew
a
certain
white
man
who
claimed
a
whole
river
valley
north
of
the
yukon
as
his
who
warned
off
hunting
parties
of
indians
who
ventured
upon
it
and
made
them
give
up
game
killed
in
his
territory
they
came
to
the
mission
and
complained
about
it
but
they
never
withstood
the
usurper
it
ought
to
be
added
that
it
always
appeared
more
as
the
making
good
of
a
practical
joke
than
as
a
serious
pretension
but
the
point
is
the
indians
submitted
so
far
as
these
natives
of
the
interior
are
concerned
they
were
never
idolaters
i
can
not
find
that
they
had
any
distinct
notion
of
worship
at
all
their
religion
had
root
in
a
certain
frantic
terror
of
the
unknown
and
found
expression
in
ceaseless
efforts
to
propitiate
the
malign
spirits
surrounding
them
on
every
side
thus
they
were
given
over
to
the
mastery
of
those
amongst
them
who
had
the
traditional
art
of
such
propitiation
and
fell
more
or
less
completely
under
that
cruellest
and
most
venal
of
sways
the
tyranny
of
the
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
and
hard
to
exaggerate
the
grinding
and
brutal
exactions
to
which
this
rule
led
anything
that
a
man
possessed
might
be
demanded
and
must
be
yielded
on
pain
of
disease
and
death
even
to
the
whole
season
catch
of
fur
or
the
deflowering
of
a
young
daughter
the
utmost
greed
and
lust
that
can
disgrace
humanity
found
its
indian
expression
in
the
lives
of
some
of
these
since
every
sort
of
tyranny
has
its
vulnerable
spot
since
the
despotism
of
russia
was
tempered
by
assassination
and
of
japan
by
the
effect
of
public
suicide
so
melioration
of
the
tyranny
of
the
seems
to
have
been
found
in
rivalry
amongst
members
of
the
craft
itself
oppressed
beyond
endurance
by
one
practitioner
allegiance
would
be
transferred
to
some
new
claimant
of
occult
powers
and
the
breaking
of
the
monopoly
of
magic
would
be
followed
by
a
temporary
lightening
of
the
burdens
some
of
the
most
lurid
of
alaskan
legends
deal
with
the
thaumaturgic
contests
of
rival
and
one
judges
that
sleight
of
hand
and
even
hypnotic
suggestion
were
cultivated
to
a
fine
point
to
such
minds
the
christian
teaching
comes
with
glad
and
one
may
say
instantaneous
acceptance
their
attitude
is
entirely
childlike
they
are
anxious
to
be
told
more
and
more
about
it
to
be
told
it
over
and
over
again
there
is
never
the
slightest
sign
of
incredulity
it
does
not
occur
to
them
as
possible
that
a
man
should
be
sent
all
this
way
to
them
should
hunt
them
up
and
seek
them
out
to
tell
it
to
them
unless
it
were
true
and
one
learns
over
again
how
universal
is
the
appeal
the
christian
religion
and
in
particular
the
life
of
our
lord
makes
to
mankind
i
have
seen
indians
and
esquimaux
mixed
hearing
for
the
first
time
the
details
of
the
passion
stirred
to
as
great
indignation
as
was
that
barbarian
chieftain
who
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
and
cried
would
i
and
my
men
had
been
there
or
those
western
cowboys
so
the
story
runs
bred
in
illiteracy
and
irreligion
to
whose
children
a
had
given
an
account
of
the
same
great
events
and
who
rode
up
to
the
schoolhouse
the
next
day
with
guns
and
ropes
and
asked
which
way
did
them
blamed
jews
go
the
lies
low
may
himself
profess
acceptance
of
the
new
teaching
may
even
really
accept
it
for
it
is
very
hard
indeed
to
follow
and
judge
all
the
mental
processes
of
an
indian
yes
though
it
expressly
sweep
all
his
devils
away
out
of
the
sick
out
of
the
wind
and
storm
from
off
every
grave
mound
though
it
leave
him
no
paltry
or
sprite
to
work
upon
with
his
conjurations
yet
the
old
superstition
dies
hard
often
crops
up
when
one
had
thought
it
perished
and
even
sometimes
maintains
itself
sub
rosa
side
by
side
with
definite
regular
christian
worship
sidenote
the
old
old
story
the
arctic
explorer
stefanson
a
careful
and
acute
observer
who
has
had
exceptional
opportunities
for
observation
of
the
intimate
life
of
the
esquimaux
has
written
much
lately
of
the
grafting
of
christianity
upon
native
superstition
and
the
existence
of
both
together
as
though
it
were
some
new
thing
or
newly
noticed
by
himself
yet
every
one
familiar
with
the
history
of
christianity
knows
that
it
has
characterised
the
progress
of
religion
in
all
ages
there
was
never
a
people
yet
that
did
not
in
great
measure
do
this
thing
nor
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
of
men
minds
it
is
impossible
to
uproot
customs
of
immemorial
antiquity
without
leaving
some
rootlets
behind
and
what
is
acquired
joins
itself
insensibly
to
what
is
retained
and
either
the
incongruity
is
hidden
beneath
a
change
of
nomenclature
or
is
not
hidden
at
all
our
own
social
life
is
threaded
through
and
through
with
customs
and
practices
which
go
back
to
a
superstitious
origin
the
matter
is
such
a
commonplace
of
history
that
it
is
bootless
to
labour
it
here
a
scientist
is
only
a
scientist
how
that
name
tends
continually
to
depreciate
itself
as
the
pursuit
of
physical
science
is
divorced
more
and
more
completely
from
a
knowledge
of
literature
from
a
knowledge
of
the
humanities
and
a
scientist
is
a
poor
guide
to
an
acquaintance
with
man
civilised
or
uncivilised
to
come
to
the
study
of
any
race
of
man
even
the
most
primitive
without
some
knowledge
of
all

history
of

ill
equipped
that
no

conclusions
are
likely
to
be
reached
your

such
are
most
of
them
may
be
competent
to
deal
with
circles
and
triangles
with
wheels
and

with

with

and
generally
with
magnetos

with
all
the
heavenly

if
you
like
but
he
has
no
equipment
to
deal
with

somatic
anthropology
in
particular
tends
to
assume
in
some
quarters
such
an
overimportance
that
one
falls
back
upon
the
recollection
that
the
original
head
measurers
were
hatters
and
that
all
hatters
are
proverbially
mad
the
occupation
would
seem
to
carry
the
taint
it
was
with
much
pleasure
that
i
was
able
to
hold
out
hope
to
chief
isaac
of
the
mission
and
the
school
he
desired
so
earnestly
for
his
people
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
of
them
were
in
the
completely
unevangelised
state
which
has
been
dwelt
upon
that
to
all
of
them
the
teaching
of
those
two
full
days
was
novel
some
of
them
like
the
chief
himself
had
been
across
to
the
yukon
long
ago
and
still
bore
some
trace
of
the
early
labours
of
the
church
of
england
missionaries
to
whom
this
region
of
alaska
that
adjoins
canada
is
so
much
indebted
others
had
once
been
to
the
ketchumstock
upon
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
our
missionary
at
eagle
and
had
received
instruction
from
him
but
there
were
many
present
in
that
tent
who
had
never
seen
any
missionary
never
had
any
teaching
to
whom
it
was
wholly
new
save
as
they
might
have
picked
up
some
inkling
from
those
that
had
been
more
fortunate

tribal
connections
when
we
left
this
encampment
isaac
sent
two
of
his
young
men
to
guide
us
with
a
sled
drawn
by
three
or
four
small
dogs
so
gaily
caparisoned
with
and

that

here

is

of

with
the
upper

natives
and
so
with
those
of

never
saw
the
a
broad
bright
ornamented

that
lies
upon
the
dog

under

a
few
hours
journey
brought
us
to
the
tanana
river
again
which
we
crossed
and
took
a
portage
on
the
other
side
that
went
up
a
long
defile
and
then
along
a
ridge
and
then
down
another
long
defile
until
at
night
we
reached
the
native
village
at
lake
mansfield
a
picturesque
spot
for
the
lake
is
entirely
surrounded
by
mountains
except
on
the
side
which
opens
to
the
river
here
the
alaskan
range
and
the
tanana
river
have
approached
so
close
that
the
water
almost
washes
the
base
of
the
and
the
scenery
is
as
fine
and
bold
as
any
in
alaska
and
here
at
lake
mansfield
if
only
there
were
navigable
connection
between
the
lake
and
the
river
into
which
it
drains
would
be
an
admirable
place
for
a
mission
station
a
couple
of
hours
next
day
took
us
the
seven
remaining
miles
to
the
tanana
crossing
here
at
that
time
was
a
station
of
the
military
telegraph
connecting
valdez
on
the
coast
with
fort
egbert
eagle
on
the
yukon
a
line
maintained
at
enormous
expense
purely
for
military
purposes
it
passed
through
an
almost
entirely
uninhabited
country
in
which
perhaps
scarcely
a
dozen
messages
would
originate
in
a
year
the
and
fort
egbert
itself
are
now
abandoned
strategic
considerations
constitute
a
vague
and
variable
quantity
it
was
strange
to
find
this
little
station
with
two
or
three
men
of
the
away
out
here
in
the
wilderness
their
post
was
supplied
by
mule
from
fort
egbert
more
than
two
hundred
miles
away
and
they
told
me
that
only
ten
pounds
out
of
every
hundred
that
left
fort
egbert
reached
the
crossing
so
is
a
through
such
country
we
amused
ourselves
calculating
just
how
much
farther
mules
and
men
could
go
until
they
ate
up
they
could
carry
the
tanana
crossing
is
a
central
spot
for
the
indians
of
this
region
two
days
journey
up
the
river
was
the
village
of
the
tetlin
indians
two
days
journey
into
the
mountain
range
were
the
mantasta
indians
two
days
journey
across
towards
the
yukon
were
the
ketchumstock
indians
most
of
them
would
congregate
at
this
spot
for
certain
parts
of
the
year
should
we
plant
a
mission
there
and
despite
the
picturesque
situation
of
lake
mansfield
it
looked
as
if
the
crossing
were
the
best
point
for
building
sidenote
the
tanana
crossing
our
route
lay
northeast
across
country
to
fortymile
on
the
yukon
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
along
the
trail
for
the
greater
part
of
the
distance
by
which
the
mule
train
reached
the
tanana
crossing
the
first
five
miles
was
all
a
long
stiff
steady
climb
to
the
crest
of
the
mountain
that
rises
just
behind
the
crossing
we
had
to
take
it
slowly
with
frequent
stops
so
steep
was
the
grade
and
every
now
and
then
we
got
tantalising
glimpses
through
the
timber
of
the
scene
that
spread
wider
and
wider
below
us
bend
after
bend
of
the
tanana
river
unfolded
itself
the
alaskan
range
gave
peak
after
peak
there
lay
lake
mansfield
deep
in
its
amphitheatre
of
hills
with
the
indian
village
at
its
head
at
last
my
impatience
for
the
view
that
promised
made
me
leave
the
boys
we
still
had
isaac
young
men
and
push
on
alone
to
the
top
and
it
was
indeed
by
far
the
noblest
view
of
the
winter
one
of
the
grandest
and
most
extensive
panoramas
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
perhaps
three
miles
away
as
the
crow
flies
from
the
river
and
seventeen
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
it
as
the
aneroid
gave
it
we
were
already
on
the
watershed
and
everywhere
in
the
direction
we
were
travelling
the
draws
and
gullies
of
the
fortymile
river
stretched
out
so
clear
and
beautiful
a
display
of
the
beginnings
of
a
great
drainage
system
that
my
attention
was
arrested
notwithstanding
my
eagerness
for
the
sight
that
awaited
my
turning
around
but
it
was
upon
turning
around
and
looking
in
the
direction
from
which
we
had
come
that
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
entered
into
the
scene
there
was
indeed
no
one
great
dominating
feature
in
this
prospect
as
in
the
view
of
denali
from
the
rampart
portage
but
the
whole
background
bounding
the
vision
completely
was
one
vast
wall
of
lofty
white
peaks
stretching
without
a
break
for
a
hundred
miles
enormous
cloud
masses
rose
and
fell
about
this
barrier
now
unfolding
to
reveal
dark
chasms
and
glittering
glaciers
now
enshrouding
them
again
in
the
middle
distance
the
tanana
river
wound
and
twisted
its
firm
white
line
amidst
broken
patches
of
snow
and
timber
far
away
to
either
hand
and
where
glacial
affluents
discharged
into
it
were
finer
threadlike
lines
that
marked
the
many
mouths
the
thick
spruce
mantling
the
slope
in
the
foreground
gave
a
sombre
contrast
to
the
fields
of
snow
and
the
yellow
march
sunshine
was
poured
over
all
the
wide
landscape
save
where
the
great
clouds
contended
with
the
great
mountains
the
boys
had
stopped
to
build
a
fire
and
brew
some
tea
before
leaving
the
timber
and
i
was
glad
of
it
for
it
gave
me
the
chance
to
gaze
my
fill
upon
the
inspiring
and
fascinating
scene
in
the
pleasant
warmth
of
the
mountain
top
with
the
thermometer
at
in
the
shade
and
just
higher
in
the
sunshine
sidenote
a
noble
view
how
grateful
i
was
for
the
clear
bright
day
what
a
disappointment
it
has
been
again
and
again
to
reach
such
an
eminence
and
see
nothing
it
was
the
most
extensive
view
of
the
great
alaskan
range
i
had
ever
secured
that
long
line
of
sharp
peaks
that
stretches
and
broadens
from
the
coast
inland
until
it
culminates
in
the
highest
point
of
the
north
american
continent
and
then
curves
its
way
back
to
the
coast
again
of
course
what
lay
here
within
the
vision
was
only
a
small
part
of
one
arm
of
the
range
it
stopped
far
short
of
denali
on
the
one
hand
and
mount
sanford
on
the
other
though
it
included
mount
kimball
and
mount
hayes
yet
it
was
the
most
impressive
sight
of
a
mountain
chain
i
had
ever
beheld
it
was
a
sight
to
be
glad
and
grateful
for
to
put
high
amongst
one
joyful
remembrances
and
with
this
notable
sight
we
bade
farewell
to
the
tanana
valley
down
the
hill
we
went
into
fortymile
water
and
into
a
rolling
country
crossed
by
the
military
mule
trail
if
the
morning
had
been
glorious
the
evening
was
full
of
penance
long
before
night
our
feet
were
sore
from
slipping
and
sliding
into
those
wretched
mule
tracks
one
can
not
take
one
eyes
from
the
trail
for
a
moment
every
footstep
must
be
watched
and
even
then
one
is
continually
stumbling
we
were
able
however
to
rig
our
team
with
the
double
hitch
that
is
so
much
more
economical
of
power
than
the
tandem
hitch
whenever
the
width
of
the
trail
permits
it
we
now
carry
a
convertible
rig
so
that
on
narrow
trails
or
in
deep
snow
we
can
string
out
the
dogs
one
in
front
of
the
other
and
when
the
trail
is
wide
enough
can
hitch
them
side
by
side
seal
the
great
dane
pup
we
got
at
the
salchaket
was
a
good
and
strong
puller
but
he
had
no
coat
and
no
sense
it
is
bad
enough
to
have
no
coat
in
this
country
but
to
have
no
coat
and
no
sense
is
fatal
as
he
found
his
feet
were
continually
sore
and
he
had
to
be
specially
provided
for
at
night
if
it
were
at
all
cold
a
dog
utterly
unsuited
to
alaska
thirty
miles
of
such
going
as
has
been
described
is
tiring
in
the
extreme
and
when
we
reached
the
lone
cabin
behold
fifteen
indians
camped
about
it
for
whom
when
supper
was
done
followed
two
hours
of
teaching
and
the
baptism
of
six
children
i
would
have
liked
to
have
stayed
a
day
with
them
but
if
we
were
to
spend
palm
sunday
at
fortymile
and
easter
at
eagle
as
had
been
promised
the
time
remaining
did
no
more
than
serve
and
there
was
a
large
band
of
indians
to
visit
at
ketchumstock
the
next
day
took
us
into
and
across
the
ketchumstock
flats
a
wide
basin
surrounded
by
hills
and
drained
by
the
mosquito
fork
of
the
fortymile
the
supported
on
tripods
against
the
summer
yielding
of
the
marshy
soil
cuts
straight
across
country
this
basin
and
the
hills
around
form
one
of
the
greatest
caribou
countries
perhaps
in
the
world
all
day
we
had
passed
fragments
of
the
long
fences
that
were
in
use
in
times
past
by
the
indians
for
driving
the
animals
into
convenient
places
for
slaughter
the
annual
migration
of
the
vast
herd
that
roams
the
section
of
alaska
between
the
yukon
and
the
tanana
rivers
swarms
over
this
flat
and
through
these
hills
and
we
were
told
at
the
ketchumstock
telegraph
station
by
the
men
that
they
estimated
that
upward
of
one
hundred
thousand
animals
crossed
the
mosquito
fork
the
previous
october
sidenote
caribou
the
big
game
of
alaska
is
not
yet
seriously
diminished
though
there
was
need
for
the
legal
protection
that
has
of
late
years
been
given
it
is
probable
that
more
caribou
and
young
moose
are
killed
every
year
by
wolves
than
by
hunters
only
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
considerable
settlement
is
there
danger
of
reckless
and
wasteful
slaughter
and
some
attention
is
paid
by
game
wardens
to
the
markets
of
such
places
the
stands
in
greater
danger
of
extermination
than
either
caribou
or
moose
its
meat
the
most
delicious
mutton
in
the
world
as
it
has
been
pronounced
by
epicures
brings
a
higher
price
than
other
wild
meat
and
it
is
easy
to
destroy
a
band
completely
the
sheep
on
the
mountains
of
the
alaskan
range
nearest
to
fairbanks
have
it
is
said
been
very
greatly
diminished
and
that
need
not
be
wondered
at
when
one
sees
sled
load
after
sled
load
aggregating
several
tons
of
meat
brought
in
at
one
shipment
the
law
protecting
the
sheep
probably
needs
tightening
up
the
big
game
is
a
great
resource
to
all
the
people
of
the
country
white
and
native
it
is
no
small
advantage
to
be
able
to
take
one
gun
in
the
fall
and
go
out
in
the
valleys
and
kill
a
moose
that
will
suffice
for
one
man
meat
almost
the
whole
winter
or
go
into
the
hills
and
kill
four
or
five
caribou
that
will
stock
his
larder
equally
well
the
fresh
clean
meat
of
the
wilds
has
to
most
palates
far
finer
flavour
than
any
meat
that
can
be
brought
into
the
country
and
save
at
one
or
two
centres
of
population
and
distribution
meat
is
not
available
at
all
without
its
big
game
alaska
would
be
virtually
uninhabitable
therefore
most
white
men
are
content
that
the
necessary
measures
be
taken
to
prevent
the
wasteful
slaughter
of
the
game
for
the
rights
of
the
prospector
and
trapper
and
traveller
and
the
rights
of
the
natives
to
kill
at
any
time
what
is
necessary
for
food
are
explicitly
reserved
sidenote
the
ketchumstock
we
reached
the
village
and
telegraph
post
of
ketchumstock
for
the
night
only
to
find
all
the
natives
gone
hunting
but
since
they
had
gone
in
the
direction
of
chicken
creek
towards
which
we
were
travelling
we
were
able
to
catch
up
with
them
the
next
morning
without
going
far
out
of
our
way
while
we
were
pitching
our
tent
near
their
encampment
came
two
or
three
natives
with
dog
teams
and
as
the
dogs
hesitated
to
pass
our
dogs
loose
on
the
trail
a
voluble
string
of
curses
in
english
fell
from
the
indian
lips
such
is
usually
the
first
indication
of
contact
with
white
men
and
in
this
case
it
spoke
of
the
proximity
of
the
mining
on
chicken
creek
to
discover
the
women
chewing
tobacco
was
to
add
but
another
evidence
of
the
sophistication
of
this
tribe
a
different
people
from
chief
isaac
tribe
different
through
many
years
familiarity
with
the
whites
at
these
diggings
if
the
mission
to
be
built
at
the
crossing
tends
to
keep
these
indians
on
the
tanana
river
and
thus
away
from
the
demoralisation
of
the
diggings
it
will
do
them
solid
service
in
some
way
foul
and
profane
language
falls
even
more
offensively
from
indians
than
from
whites
for
the
same
reason
perhaps
that
it
sounds
more
offensive
and
shocking
from
children
than
from
adults
sometimes
the
indian
does
not
in
the
least
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
uses
they
are
the
first
english
words
he
ever
heard
and
he
hears
them
over
and
over
again
so
here
another
day
and
a
half
was
spent
in
instruction
there
are
some
forty
souls
in
this
tribe
and
they
have
had
teaching
from
time
to
time
though
not
in
the
last
few
years
at
the
mouths
of
missionaries
from
yukon
posts
most
of
the
adults
had
been
baptized
i
baptized
sixteen
children
one
curious
feature
of
my
stay
was
the
megaphonic
recapitulation
of
the
heads
of
the
instruction
after
each
session
by
an
elderly
indian
who
stood
out
in
the
midst
of
the
tents
what
on
earth
this
man
with
his
voice
was
proclaiming
at
such
length
we
were
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
and
upon
inquiry
were
informed
them
women
not
much
sense
one
time
tell
quick
forget
two
time
tell
maybe
little
remember
so
when
we
stopped
for
dinner
and
for
supper
and
for
bed
each
time
this
spieler
stood
forth
and
reiterated
the
main
points
of
the
discourse
for
the
as
doughty
would
say
whose
account
of
the
attitude
of
the
arabs
to
their
women
often
reminds
me
of
the
alaskan
indians
it
was
interesting
but
i
should
have
preferred
to
edit
the
recapitulation
when
all
was
done
for
the
day
and
we
thought
to
go
to
bed
came
an
indian
named
these
white
man
nicknames
however
dreadful
are
always
accepted
and
used
for
a
long
confabulation
about
the
affairs
of
the
tribe
and
i
gathered
incidentally
that
gambling
at
the
telegraph
station
had
been
the
main
diversion
of
the
winter
it
seems
ungracious
to
insist
so
much
upon
the
evil
influence
of
the
white
men
we
had
been
cordially
received
and
entertained
at
that
very
place
and
our
money
refused
but
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
abandonment
of
the
will
be
a
good
thing
for
these
natives
put
two
or
three
young
men
of
no
special
intellectual
resource
or
ambition
down
in
a
lonely
spot
like
this
with
no
society
at
all
save
that
of
the
natives
and
practically
nothing
to
do
and
there
is
a
natural
and
almost
inevitable
trend
to
evil
to
the
exceptional
man
with
the
desire
of
promotion
with
books
and
all
this
leisure
it
would
be
an
admirable
opportunity
but
he
would
be
quite
an
exceptional
man
who
should
rise
altogether
superior
to
the
temptations
to
idleness
and
debauchery
one
may
have
true
and
deep
sympathy
with
these
young
men
and
yet
be
conscious
of
the
harm
they
often
bring
about
ten
miles
or
so
from
the
encampment
brought
us
to
chicken
creek
and
from
that
point
we
took
the
fortymile
river
the
direct
trail
to
eagle
with
its
exasperating
mule
tracks
was
now
left
and
our
journey
was
on
the
ice
but
so
warm
was
the
weather
that
of
march
that
we
were
all
day
and
within
the
space
of
eight
hours
that
we
were
travelling
we
had
snow
sleet
rain
and
sunshine
leaving
the
main
river
we
turned
up
walker
fork
and
after
a
few
miles
leaving
that
we
turned
up
jack
wade
creek
and
pursued
it
far
up
towards
its
head
ere
we
reached
the
for
the
night
sidenote
the
fortymile
we
were
now
on
historic
ground
so
far
as
gold
mining
in
alaska
is
concerned
the
fortymilers
bear
the
same
pioneer
relation
to
gold
mining
in
the
north
that
the
fortyniners
bear
to
gold
mining
in
california
ever
since
placers
have
been
worked
in
this
district
and
it
still
yields
gold
though
the
output
and
the
number
of
men
are
alike
much
reduced
it
is
interesting
to
talk
with
some
of
the
original
locators
of
this
camp
who
may
yet
be
found
here
and
there
in
the
country
and
to
learn
of
the
conditions
in
those
early
days
when
a
steamboat
came
up
the
yukon
once
in
a
season
bringing
such
supplies
and
mail
as
the
men
received
for
the
year
it
was
here
that
the
problem
of
working
frozen
ground
was
first
confronted
and
solved
here
that
the
first
miner
law
was
promulgated
the
first
miners
meeting
dealt
out
justice
your
anywhere
is
commonly
temporis
but
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
these
early
and
certainly
most
adventurous
some
of
whom
forced
a
way
into
the
country
when
there
were
no
routes
of
travel
and
subsisted
on
its
resources
while
they
explored
and
prospected
it
were
men
of
a
higher
stamp
than
many
who
have
come
in
since
the
extent
to
which
that
early
prospecting
was
carried
is
not
generally
known
for
these
men
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
left
no
record
behind
them
there
are
few
creek
beds
that
give
any
promise
at
all
in
the
whole
of
this
vast
country
that
have
not
had
some
holes
sunk
in
them
even
in
districts
so
remote
as
the
koyukuk
signs
of
old
prospecting
are
encountered
when
a
stampede
took
place
to
the
red
mountain
or
indian
river
country
of
the
middle
koyukuk
in
i
was
told
that
there
was
not
a
creek
in
the
camp
that
did
not
show
signs
of
having
been
prospected
long
before
although
it
had
passed
altogether
out
of
knowledge
that
this
particular
region
had
ever
been
visited
by
prospectors
sidenote
sniping
on
the
bars
as
the
fortymile
is
the
oldest
gold
camp
in
the
north
some
of
its
trail
making
is
of
the
best
in
alaska
in
particular
the
trail
from
the
head
of
jack
wade
creek
down
into
steel
creek
reminded
one
of
the
alpine
roads
in
its
bold
not
to
say
daring
engineering
it
drops
from
bench
to
bench
in
great
sweeping
curves
always
with
a
practicable
grade
and
must
descend
nigh
a
thousand
feet
in
a
couple
of
miles
at
the
mouth
of
steel
creek
we
are
on
the
fortymile
river
again
having
saved
a
journey
by
this
traverse
and
here
on
the
fortymile
we
passed
several
men
sniping
on
the
bars
as
the
very
first
alaskan
did
on
this
same
river
and
probably
on
these
same
bars
years
ago
one
hand
moved
the
rocker
to
and
fro
and
the
other
poured
water
into
it
with
the
long
tom
so
was
the
gold
washed
out
of
the
gravel
taken
from
just
below
the
ice
it
was
interesting
to
see
this
primitive
method
still
in
practice
and
to
learn
from
the
men
that
they
were
making
better
than
wages
the
fortymile
is
a
very
picturesque
but
most
tortuous
river
in
one
place
called
appropriately
the
kink
i
was
able
to
clamber
over
a
ridge
of
rocks
and
reach
another
bend
of
the
river
in
six
or
seven
minutes
and
then
had
to
wait
minutes
for
the
dog
team
going
at
a
good
clip
to
come
around
to
me
at
length
we
reached
the
spot
where
a
vista
cut
through
the
timber
that
clothes
both
banks
marked
the
meridian
the
international
boundary
and
passed
out
of
alaska
into
british
territory
a
few
miles
more
brought
us
to
moose
creek
where
a
little
canadian
is
situated
and
there
we
spent
the
night
the
next
day
we
reached
the
yukon
passing
gold
dredges
laid
up
for
the
winter
and
other
signs
of
mining
activity
going
through
the
narrow
wild
cañon
of
the
fortymile
and
so
to
the
little
town
at
its
mouth
of
the
same
name
where
there
is
a
mission
of
the
church
of
england
and
a
post
of
the
royal
northwest
mounted
police
i
never
come
into
contact
with
this
admirable
body
of
men
without
wishing
that
we
had
a
similar
body
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
law
in
alaska
sunday
was
spent
there
officiating
for
the
layman
in
charge
of
the
mission
and
in
interesting
talk
with
the
sergeant
of
police
about
the
annual
winter
journey
from
dawson
to
fort
mcpherson
on
the
mckenzie
from
which
he
had
just
returned
with
a
detail
of
men
the
next
winter
he
and
his
detail
lost
their
way
and
starved
and
froze
to
death
on
the
same
journey
here
at
one
time
was
a
flourishing
indian
mission
and
school
and
here
bishop
bompas
the
true
apostle
of
the
north
lived
for
some
time
the
story
of
this
man
years
devotion
to
the
indians
of
the
yukon
and
mckenzie
rivers
is
one
of
the
brave
chapters
of
missionary
history
but
the
church
of
england
does
not
advertise
writers
about
alaska
even
writers
about
alaskan
missions
carefully
collect
all
the
data
of
the
early
russian
missions
on
the
coast
but
ignore
altogether
the
equally
influential
and
lasting
work
done
along
five
hundred
miles
of
what
is
now
the
american
yukon
by
the
missionary
clergy
of
the
english
church
before
and
after
the
purchase
bishop
bompas
identified
himself
so
closely
with
the
natives
as
to
become
almost
one
of
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
white
men
and
many
curious
stories
linger
amongst
the
as
to
his
habits
and
appearance
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
bishop
was
a
son
of
that
sergeant
bompas
of
the
english
bar
from
whom
dickens
drew
the

two
short

travel
brought
us
across
the

again
to

at

have
perhaps
the

commanding
situation
of

on

the

rise
with
dignity
just
across

break
pleasingly
into

robert
louis
stevenson
said
that
edinburgh
has
the
finest
situation
of
any
capital
in
europe
and
pays
for
it
by
having
the
worst
climate
of
any
city
in
the
world
it
would
not
be
just
to
paraphrase
this
description
with
regard
to
eagle
for
while
it
is
unsurpassed
on
the
yukon
for
site
there
are
spots
on
that
river
where
still
more
disagreeable
weather
prevails
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
position
of
the
place
subjects
it
to
exceedingly
bitter
winds
or
that
the
valley
of
eagle
creek
which
gives
pleasing
variety
to
the
prospect
acts
also
as
a
channel
to
convey
the
full
force
of
the
blast
climate
everywhere
is
a
very
local
thing
topographical
considerations
often
altogether
outweigh
geographical
and
nowhere
is
this
truer
than
in
alaska
commanding
sites
are
necessarily
exposed
sites
and
he
who
would
dwell
in
comfort
must
build
in
seclusion
a
native
village
of
eighty
or
ninety
souls
with
its
church
and
school
lies
three
miles
from
the
town
so
that
the
relative
positions
of
village
town
and
military
post
exactly
duplicate
those
at
tanana
it
must
at
once
be
stated
however
that
this
situation
has
not
led
to
anything
like
the
demoralisation
amongst
the
natives
at
eagle
that
thrusts
itself
into
notice
at
the
other
place
whether
it
were
the
longer
training
in
christian
morals
that
lay
behind
these
people
or
better
hap
in
the
matter
of
post
commanders
certainly
there
was
never
such
scandalous
irregularity
and
indifference
at
egbert
as
marked
one
administration
at
gibbon
or
the
vigilance
during
a
number
of
consecutive
years
of
an
especially
active
deputy
marshal
and
the
wisdom
and
concern
through
an
even
longer
period
of
a
commissioner
much
above
the
common
stamp
f
or
all
these
causes
combined
the
natives
at
eagle
have
not
suffered
from
the
proximity
of
soldiers
and
civilians
in
the
same
measure
as
the
natives
at
tanana
drunkenness
and
debauchery
there
have
been
again
and
again
but
they
have
been
severely
checked
and
restrained
by
both
the
civil
and
military
authorities
it
was
pleasant
during
holy
week
and
easter
to
see
so
many
of
the
enlisted
men
of
the
garrison
taking
part
in
the
services
in
town
pleasant
especially
to
see
officers
and
men
singing
together
in
the
choir
a
tribute
to
the
tact
and
zeal
of
the
earnest
layman
in
charge
of
this
mission
and
it
was
pleasant
at
the
village
to
hear
the
native
liturgy
again
and
to
see
old
men
and
women
following
the
lessons
in

army
as

after
regiment
spent
its
brief
term
of
foreign
service
in
the
north
gazing
upon
the
empty
quarters
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
came
back
vividly
when
there
was
diphtheria
amongst
the
natives
at
circle
and
none
to
cope
with
it
save
the
missionary
nurse
the
civil
codes
containing
no
provision
for
quarantine
the
united
states
commissioner
at
circle
could
not
help
and
the
indians
grew
restive
and
rebellious
and
when
christmas
came
broke
through
the
restrictions
completely
even
some
of
the
whites
of
the
place
defied
her
prohibition
and
attended
native
dances
and
encouraged
the
indians
in
their
folly
sidenote
some
army
officers
so
i
went
up
the
week
journey
to
eagle
and
sought
assistance
from
major
plummer
the
officer
commanding
the
post
who
after
telegraphing
to
washington
promptly
despatched
a
hospital
steward
and
a
couple
of
soldiers
and
placed
them
entirely
at
the
nurse
disposal
i
think
we
have
any
law
for
it
he
said
but
we
bluff
it
out
and
bluff
it
out
they
did
very
effectively
until
the
disease
was
stamped
out
and
then
they
thoroughly
disinfected
and
whitewashed
every
cabin
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
sick
i
used
to
tell
that
nurse
that
so
far
as
i
knew
she
was
the
only
woman
who
had
ever
had
command
of
united
states
soldiers
then
there
was
captain
langdon
of
the
same
regiment
the
scholarly
soldier
with
the
account
of
every
great
campaign
in
history
at
his
fingers
ends
i
recollect
one
evening
when
we
had
been
talking
of
the
peninsular
war
i
ventured
to
spring
on
him
the
ancient
schoolboy
conundrum
what
lines
are
those
the
most
famous
ever
made
by
an
englishman
yet
that
are
never
quoted
lines
said
he
lines
though
i
do
think
he
had
ever
heard
the
jest
they
must
be
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
how
well
i
remember
the
musical
box
that
used
to
arouse
me
at
seven
in
the
morning
however
late
we
had
sat
talking
the
night
before
and
that
young
lieutenant
of
wealthy
new
york
people
just
arrived
from
west
point
who
was
sent
by
another
commandant
to
report
upon
the
condition
of
the
natives
at
the
village
and
who
came
back
and
reported
the
whole
population
in
utter
destitution
and
recommended
the
issue
of
free
rations
to
them
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
the
administration
of
this
commanding
officer
some
sixteen
or
eighteen
persons
were
put
upon
the
list
for
gratuitous
grub
and
it
took
a
written
protest
to
get
them
off
for
no
one
who
has
the
welfare
of
the
natives
at
heart
can
tolerate
the
notion
of
making
them
paupers
these
who
have
always
fended
abundantly
for
themselves
and
can
entirely
do
so
yet
with
free
rations
there
would
be
no
more
hunting
no
more
trapping
no
more
fishing
and
a
hardy
race
would
sink
at
once
to
sloth
and
beggary
and
forget
all
that
made
men
of
them
if
it
were
designed
to
destroy
the
indian
at
a
blow
here
is
an
easy
way
to
do
it
yet
there
are
some
obsessed
with
the
craze
about
what
is
called
education
regarding
it
as
an
end
in
itself
and
not
as
a
means
to
any
end
who
recommend
this
pauperising
because
it
would
permit
the
execution
of
a
compulsory
law
or
is
it
a
personal
delusion
of
mine
that
esteems
an
honest
industrious
indian
who
can
not
read
and
write
english
above
one
who
can
read
and
write
english
and
can
do
nothing
else
and
so
separates
me
from
many
who
are
working
amongst
the
natives
these
days
at
the
end
of
march
when
the
sun
shines
more
than
twelve
hours
in
the
are
too
long
for
the
ordinary
winter
miles
or
so
and
yet
not
quite
long
enough
even
if
man
and
dogs
could
stand
it
to
double
the
stage
so
that
there
is
much
daylight
leisure
at
one
grows
anxious
after
four
months
on
the
trail
to
be
done
with
it
to
draw
as
quickly
as
may
be
to
place
one
even
becomes
a
little
impatient
of
the
continual
dog
talk
and
mining
talk
of
the
to
which
one
has
listened
all
the
winter
on
the
other
hand
the
travelling
is
very
pleasant
and
the
going
usually
very
good
so
that
one
may
often
ride
on
the
sled
for
long
stretches
by
river

portage
one
portage
that
comes
so
finely
down
to
the
yukon
from
a
bench
that
there
is
pleasure
in
anticipating
the
view
it
affords
in
two
days
we
reached
the
nation
just
below
the
mouth
of
the
nation
river
a
name
that
has
always
puzzled
me
here
all
night
long
the
wolves
howling
around
the
carcass
of
a
horse
kept
our
dogs
awake
and
the
whimpering
of
the
dogs
kept
us
awake
the
country
beyond
the
yukon
to
the
northeast
the
large
area
included
between
the
yukon
and
the
porcupine
into
which
the
nation

offers
passage

one
of
the
wildest
and
least
known

in
game

as
inadequate

permitted
round
coal

the
scenery
becomes
bold
and
attractive
but
we
found
as
usual
that
as
we
pushed
farther
and
farther
down
the
river
the
snow
was
deeper
and
the
going
not
so
good
the
sun
grows
very
bright

the
snow
these
days
of
late
march
and
early
april
even
through
heavily
tinted
glasses
it
inflames
the
eyes
more
or
less
and
a
couple
of
hours
without
protection
would
bring
bright
days
at
this
season
are
the
only
days
in
all
the
year
when
the

fort

we
reached
circle
in
a
day
and
a
half
from
woodchopper
creek
in
time
to
spend
sunday
there
circle
had
not
changed
much
in
the
five
years
that
had
elapsed
since
the
first
visit
to
it
mentioned
in
these
pages
the
slender
trellis
of
the
wireless
telegraph
had
added
a
prominent
feature
to
its
river
bank
a
few
more
empty
cabins
had
been
torn
down
for
here
it
was
necessary
to
shoot
the
great
dane
pup
we
got
at
the
salchaket
his
feet
were
still
very
sore
and
he
quite
useless
for
the
next
winter
while
doc
was
returned
to
me
from
fairbanks
not
much
the
worse
for
his
severe
indian
after

begged
for
the
dog
but
i
had
more
regard
for
him
than
to
turn
him
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
an
indian
there
are
exceptional
indians
but
for
my
part
i
would
rather
be
a
dead
dog
than
an
ordinary
indian
dog
so
he
died
there
remained
the
or
eighty
miles
through
the
yukon
flats
to
fort
yukon
always
the
most
dangerous
stretch
of
the
river
and
at
this
season
when
the
winter
trail
was
beginning
to
break
up
particularly
so
it
would
be
entirely
practicable
to
cut
a
land
trail
that
should
not
touch
the
river
at
all
or
not
at
more
than
one
point
between
circle
and
fort
yukon
and
such
a
portage
besides
removing
all
the
danger
would
save
perhaps
twenty
miles
in
many
places
it
was
necessary
for
one
of
us
to
go
ahead
with
an
axe
constantly
sounding
and
testing
the
ice
here
and
there
we
made
a
circuit
around
open
water
into
which
the
ice
that
bore
the
trail
had
collapsed
bodily
one
of
them
a
particularly
ugly
place
with
black
water
twenty
feet
deep
running
at
six
or
seven
miles
an
hour
i
never
pass
this
stretch
of
river
without
a
feeling
of
gratitude
that
i
am
safely
over
it
once
more
sidenote
captain
amundsen
as
we
left
the
halfway
island
we
passed
an
indian
from
fort
yukon
going
up
the
river
with
dogs
and
toboggan
and
i
chuckled
as
i
returned
his
very
polite
salutation
and
shook
hands
with
him
at
the
success
of
the
way
he
had
been
dealt
with
the
previous
fall
for
he
had
been
a
particularly
churlish
fellow
with
an
insolent
manner
six
or
seven
years
before
he
had
been
taken
by
captain
amundsen
of
the
as
guide
along
this
stretch
of
the
river
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
that
skilful
and
fortunate
navigator
had
reached
herschell
island
from
the
east
he
left
his
ship
in
winter
quarters
and
made
a
rapid
journey
with
esquimaux
across
country
to
fort
yukon
expecting
to
find
a
telegraph
station
there
from
which
he
could
send
word
of
his
success
but
to
his
disappointment
he
found
it
necessary
to
go
two
hundred
and
thirty
miles
farther
up
the
river
to
eagle
before
he
could
despatch
his
message
so
he
left
his
esquimaux
at
fort
yukon
and
took
this
indian
as
guide
and
in
his
modest
and
most
interesting
book
he
mentions
the
surliness
and
says
he
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
at
circle
some
new
outbreak
of
insolence
for
which
he
had
been
flung
out
of
a
store
decided
that
he
must
be
dealt
with
and
i
sent
for
him
for
the
chief
the
native
minister
and
the
interpreter
with
these
assessors
beside
me
and
captain
amundsen
book
open
on
the
table
i
spoke
to
the
man
of
his
general
conduct
and
reputation
i
read
the
derogatory
remark
about
him
in
the
book
printed
for
all
the
world
to
read
and
told
him
that
of
all
the
people
white
and
native
the
captain
had
met
on
his
journeys
only
one
was
spoken
of
harshly
and
he
was
the
one
it
made
a
great
impression
on
the
man
the
chief
and
the
native
minister
followed
it
up
with
their
harangues
and
the
net
result
was
a
thorough
change
in
his
whole
attitude
and
demeanour
he
told
us
he
felt
the
shame
of
being
held
up
to
the
world
as
rude
and
impudent
and
would
try
to
amend
he
has
tried
so
successfully
that
he
is
now
one
of
the
politest
and
most
courteous
indians
in
the
village
for
which
if
this
should
ever
chance
to
reach

he
will
accept

the
winter

strike
on
the
iditarod
a
tributary
of
the
innoko
some
three
years
later
opened
up
a
new
region
of
alaska
it
is
characteristic
of
a
gold
discovery
in
a
new
district
that
it
sets
men
feverishly
to
work
prospecting
all
the
adjacent
country
and
sends
them
as
far
afield
from
it
as
the
new
base
of
supplies
will
allow
them
to
stretch
their
tether
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
that
the
innoko
and
iditarod
country
lies
between
the
two
great
rivers
of
alaska
the
yukon
and
the
kuskokwim
much
lower
down
the
yukon
than
any
of
the
earlier
gold
discoveries
that
is
to
say
that
while
the
tanana
gold
fields
lie
off
the
middle
yukon
the
circle
fields
off
the
upper
yukon
the
iditarod
camp
belongs
to
the
lower
river
the
innoko
workings
were
not
extensive
nor
very
rich
but
they
furnished
a
base
for
prospecting
from
which
the
iditarod
was
reached
and
flat
creek
in
the
latter
district
promised
to
be
wonderfully
rich
immediately
upon
the
news
of
this
strike
reaching
the
other
camps
of
the
interior
preparations
were
made
far
and
wide
for
migrating
thither
upon
the
opening
of
yukon
navigation
and
the
early
summer
of
saw
a
wild
stampede
to
the
iditarod
traders
of
all
kinds
and
the
and
bobtail
that
always
flock
to
a
new
camp
were
on
the
move
so
soon
as
the
ice
went
out
from
dawson
from
the
fortymile
from
circle
from
fairbanks
from
the
koyukuk
and
as
soon
as
bering
sea
permitted
from
nome
all
sorts
of
craft
bore
all
sorts
of
people
to
the
new
eldorado
while
the
first
through
steamboats
from
the
outside
were
crowded
with
people
from
the
pacific
coast
eager
to
share
in
the
opportunity
of
wealth
the
sensational
magazines
had
been
printing
article
after
article
about
the
incalculable
riches
of
alaska
and
here
were
people
hoping
to
pick
some
of
it
up
iditarod
city
sprang
into
life
as
the
largest
city
of
the
interior
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
population
of
the
interior
of
alaska
was
shifted
a
thousand
miles
in
a
month
iditarod
city
furnished
a
new
and
large
base
of
supplies
amidst
the
heterogeneous
mass
of
humanity
that
swarmed
into
the
place
though
by
no
means
the
largest
element
in
it
were
experienced
prospectors
from
every
other
district
in
alaska
under
the
iniquitous
law
that
then
prevailed
and
has
only
recently
been
modified
by
which
there
was
no
limit
at
all
to
the
number
of
claims
in
a
district
which
one
man
could
stake
for
himself
and
others
every
creek
adjacent
to
flat
creek
every
creek
for
many
miles
in
every
direction
had
long
since
been
tied
up
by
the
men
with
and
hatchets
so
the
newly
arrived
prospectors
must
spread
out
yet
wider
and
they
were
soon
scattered
over
all
the
rugged
hundred
miles
between
iditarod
city
and
the
kuskokwim
river
here
and
there
they
found
prospects
and
here
and
there
what
promised
to
be
pay
they
started
a
new
town
georgetown
on
the
kuskokwim
itself
another
town
sprang
up
on
the
takotna
a
tributary
of
the
kuskokwim
and
the
great
commercial
company
of
alaska
ever
alert
for
new
developments
put
a
steamboat
on
the
kuskokwim
and
built
at
both
these
points
thus
the
kuskokwim
country
which
for
long
had
been
one
of
the
portions
of
alaska
was
opened
up
almost
at
a
stroke
sidenote
camp
at
below
it
was
my
purpose
to
visit
iditarod
city
during
the
winter
of
although
by
reason
of
the
distance
to
be
travelled
a
journey
thither
would
involve
the
omission
of
the
customary
winter
visit
to
upper
yukon
points
when
the
northern
trip
to
the
koyukuk
was
returned
from
at
tanana
a
sad
journey
had
to
be
made
to
nenana

body
of

accompanied

as
we
came
back
to
tanana
again
as
doctor
burke
had
in
our
journey
over
the
first
ice
of
the
koyukuk
two
years
before
two
feet
of
new
snow
lay
on
the
trail
and
the
thermometer
went
down

the

from
tanana
the
beaten
track
to
the
iditarod
lay
one
hundred
and
sixty
miles
down
the
yukon
to
lewis
landing
and
then
across
country
by
the
lewis
one
hundred
miles
to
dishkaket
on
the
innoko
and
thence
across
country
another
hundred
miles
to
iditarod
city
but
i
designed
to
penetrate
to
the
iditarod
by
another
route
i
had
long
desired
to
visit
lake
minchúmina
and
its
little
band
of
indians
and
to
pass
through
the
upper
kuskokwim
country
so
i
had
engaged
a
minchúmina
indian
as
a
guide
and
laid
my
course
up
the
tanana
river
to
the
coschaket
and
then
due
south
across
country
to
lake
minchúmina
and
the
upper
kuskokwim
the
cosna
is
a
small
stream
confluent
with
the
tanana
about
thirty
miles
above
the
mouth
of
that
river
and
we
had
hoped
to
reach
it
by
the
river
trail
upon
the
same
day
we
left
the
mission
at
tanana
the
of
february
but
the
trail
was
too
heavy
and
the
going
too
slow
and
the
start
too
late
when
we
had
reached
fish
creek
about
it
was
already
growing
dark
and
we
were
glad
to
stop
in
a
native
cabin
where
was
an
old
widow
woman
with
a
blind
daughter
the
daughter
unmarried
had
a
little
baby
and
i
inquired
through
walter
who
the
father
was
and
whether
the
girl
had
willingly
received
the
man
or
if
he
had
taken
advantage
of
her
blindness
she
named
an
unmarried
indian
known
to
me
and
declared
that
she
had
not
been
consenting
it
seemed
a
paltry
and
contemptible
trick
to
take
advantage
of
a
fatherless
blind
girl
i
baptized
the
baby
and
resolved
to
make
the
man
marry
the
girl
the
next
night
we
reached
the
coschaket
which
following
the
indian
rule
means
mouth
of
the
cosna
and
found
that
our
guide
minchúmina
john
had
already
relayed
a
load
of
grub
that
walter
had
previously
brought
here
from
tanana
one
day
march
upon
our
journey
our
course
from
the
coschaket
left
the
tanana
river
and
struck
across
country
by
an
old
indian
trail
that
had
not
been
used
that
winter
through
scrubby
spruce
and
over
frozen
lakes
and
swamps
crossing
the
cosna
several
times
a
narrow
little
river
with
high
steep
banks
the
trail
went
until
it
brought
us
to
a
hunting
camp
of
the
indians
about
eighteen
miles
from
the
coschaket
here
our
stuff
was
cached
and
here
we
spent
the
night
doctoring
the
sick
amongst
them
as
well
as
we
could
my
eyes
had
been
sorely
tried
this
day
despite
dark
smoked
glasses
for
we
were
travelling
almost
due
south
and
the
sun
was
now
some
hours
in
the
sky
and
yet
low
enough
to
shine
right
in
one
face
so
walter
stopped
at
a
stripped
some
of
the
bark
and
made
an
that
was
a
great
comfort
and
relief
from
this
place
began
the
slow
work
of
the
unbroken
snow
was
too
deep
to
permit
the
hauling
of
our
increased
load
over
it
without
a
preliminary
breaking
out
of
a
trail
on
so
camp
was
left
standing
and
walter
and
john
went
ahead
all
day
and
returned
late
at
night
with
eight
or
nine
miles
of
trail
broken
while
i
stayed
in
camp
and
had
dog
feed
cooked
and
supper
ready
the
next
day
we
advanced
the
camp
so
far
as
the
trail
was
broken
a
moose
had
used
the
trail
for
some
distance
however
since
the
boys
left
it
and
his
great
plunging
hoofs
had
torn
up
the
snow
worse
than
a
horse
would
have
done
a
driving
wind
and
heavy
snowfall
had
drifted
the
new
trail
in
the
night
so
badly
moreover
that
we
were
not
able
to
cover
the
full
stretch
that
had
been
but
camped
in
the
dusk
after
we
had
gone
eight
miles
eight
miles
in
two
days
was
certainly
very
poor
travel
and
at
this
rate
our
supplies
would
never
take
us
down
to
the
forks
of
the
kuskokwim
yet
there
was
no
other
way
in
which
we
could
proceed
the
weather
was
exceedingly
mild
too
mild
for
comfort
the
thermometer
ranging
from
to
above
and
the
dogs
felt
the
unseasonable
warmth
it
took
us
all
that
week
to
make
the
watershed
between
the
drainage
of
the
tanana
and
the
drainage
of
the
kuskokwim
a
point
about
to
lake
minchúmina
one
day
trail
was
broken
the
next
day
the
loads
went
forward
tie
the
dogs
as
securely
as
one
would
it
was
not
safe
to
go
off
and
leave
our
supplies
exposed
to
the
ravages
that
a
broken
chain
or
a
slipped
collar
might
bring
so
two
went
forward
and
i
sat
down
in
camp
the
boys
on
their
return
usually
brought
with
them
a
few
brace
of
ptarmigan
or
grouse
or
spruce
hen
or
at
the
least
a
rabbit
or
so
sidenote
the
the
to
my
mind
the
most
interesting
of
alaskan
birds
became
very
friendly
and
tame
on
these
vigils
they
stay
in
the
country
all
the
winter
when
most
birds
have
migrated
like
prosperous
mine
owners
to
less
rigorous
climates
they
turn
up
everywhere
in
the
most
mysterious
way
so
soon
as
one
begins
to
make
any
preparation
for
camping
and
they
are
bold
and
fearless
and
take
all
sorts
of
chances
on
this
journey
more
than
once
they
alighted
on
a
moving
sled
and
pecked
at
the
dried
fish
that
happened
to
be
exposed
yet
they
are
so
alert
and
so
quick
in
their
movements
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
catch
them
were
they
actually
under
one
hand
one
of
them
during
a
long
day
in
camp
grew
so
tame
that
it
pecked
crumbs
off
the
toe
of
my
moccasin
and
in
another
day
or
two
would
one
feels
sure
have
eaten
out
of
the
hand
there
is
a
curious
belief
strongly
intrenched
in
the
alaskan
mind
that
the
nest
of
this
most
common
bird
has
never
been
found
and
that
the
smithsonian
institution
has
a
standing
offer
of
a
large
sum
of
money
for
the
discovery
they
build
in
the
ten
or
twelve
feet
above
the
ground
a
nest
of
rough
twigs
and
lay
five
very
small
eggs
grey
spotted
with
black
this
at
any
rate
is
the
description
that
walter
gives
me
of
a
nest
he
discovered
with
the
bird
sitting
upon
it
and
i
have
found
the
boy
accounts
of
such
matters
entirely
trustworthy
it
is
curious
however
that
the
nest
of
a
bird
so
common
all
over
alaska
as
the
should
be
so
rarely
found
at
times
they
are
very
mischievous
and
destructive
and
the
man
who
builds
a
careless
cache
will
often
be
heard
denouncing
them
but
to
my
mind
a
bird
who
gives
us
his
enlivening
company
throughout
the
dead
of
an
alaskan
winter
deserves
what
pickings
he
can
get
sidenote
soft
weather
on
saturday
the
of
february
after
climbing
a
rather
stiff
hill
we
passed
temporarily
out
of
yukon
into
kuskokwim
waters
for
the
tributaries
of
these
two
great
drainage
systems
interlock
in
these
hills
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
we
stopped
for
lunch
a
roaring
fire
was
soon
built
and
a
great
cube
of
beaten
snow
impaled
upon
a
stake
was
set
up
before
the
fire
to
drip
into
a
pan
for
tea
water
while
the
boys
roasted
rabbits
in
a
few
hours
more
we
were
on
the
banks
of
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
east
fork
properly
the
north
fork
of
the
kuskokwim
here
in
an
unoccupied
native
cabin
we
made
our
camp
and
lay
over
sunday
and
here
began
the
most
remarkable
spell
of
weather
i
have
known
in
the
interior
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
thermometer
rose
to
and
then
to
the
snow
everywhere
was
thawing
and
presently
it
began
to
rain
steadily
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
a
decided
thaw
in
february
let
alone
rain
next
day
the
rain
turned
to
snow
but
since
the
thermometer
still
stood
around
the
snow
melted
as
it
fell
and
we
were
wet
through
all
day
the
snow
underfoot
however
was
so
much
less
and
so
much
harder
that
we
were
able
to
proceed
without
preliminary
trail
breaking
but
it
was
a
most
disagreeable
day
and
the
prelude
to
a
more
disagreeable
night
soft
wet
snow
clings
to
everything
it
touches
the
dogs
are
soon
carrying
an
additional
burden
balls
of
snow
form
on
all
projecting
tufts
of
hair
masses
of
snow
must
continually
be
beaten
off
the
sled
every
time
a
is
lifted
from
the
ground
it
lifts
a
few
pounds
of
snow
with
it
one
moccasins
and
socks
are
soon
wet
through
and
the
feet
encased
in
this
sodden
cold
covering
grow
numb
and
stay
so
we
crossed
a
considerable
mountain
pass
in
driving
snow
and
should
never
have
found
the
way
without
john
for
much
of
it
was
above
timber
and
when
it
took
us
through
woods
the
blazes
on
the
trees
were
so
bleached
with
age
as
to
be
difficult
of
recognition
the
indians
have
used
this
trail
for
generations
but
few
white
men
have
ever
passed
along
it
wet
snow
wet
spruce
boughs
wet
tent
wet
wood
wet
clothing
make
poor
camping
equipment
is
so
rarely
needed
on
the
winter
trail
that
one
does
not
bother
with
it
but
the
climate
of
the
kuskokwim
valley
is
evidently
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
interior
if
as
john
said
such
weather
is
not
remarkable
in
these
parts
at
this
season
a
third
day
was
of
much
the
same
description
thawing
and
heavily
snowing
all
day
the
thermometer
between
and
the
labour
of
going
ahead
of
the
teams
and
breaking
trail
on
the
through
slush
grew
so
great
that
i
relinquished
it
to
john
and
took
the
of
his
sled
we
were
approaching
lake
minchúmina
but
the
hills
that
led
us
into
yukon
waters
once
more
and
should
have
given
us
views
of
the
lake
and
the
great
mountains
beyond
gave
nothing
it
is
a
keen
disappointment
to
be
utterly
denied
great
views
the
expectation
of
which
has
been
a
support
through
long
distances
and
fatigues
at
noon
we
built
a
fire
with
considerable
difficulty
but
once
it
was
started
we
plied
it
with
fuel
till
we
had
a
noble
roaring
bonfire
and
we
hung
our
wet
socks
and
moccasins
and
parkees
and
caps
and
mitts
around
it
and
stayed
there
until
they
were
dry
though
the
resumption
of
our
journey
in
the
continuous
melting
snow
soon
wet
everything
through
again
sidenote
lake
minchúmina
at
length
late
in
the
evening
of
the
of
february
we
descended
a
long
ridge
and
came
upon
the
northeastern
shore
of
lake
minchúmina
one
of
the
most
considerable
lakes
of
interior
alaska
it
stretched
its
broad
expanse
away
into
the
misty
distance
the
farther
shore
quite
invisible
the
snow
driving
slowly
over
it
and
it
looked
as
though
we
had
stumbled
by
mistake
upon
the
shores
of
the
arctic
ocean
there
was
no
sort
of
trail
upon
it
and
the
sank
through
the
melting
snow
of
its
surface
into
the
water
that
lay
upon
the
ice
and
brought
up
a
load
of
slush
at
every
step
yet
the
going
would
have
been
still
worse
without
them
the
recollection
of
the
six
miles
we
trudged
across
that
lake
is
a
dismal
recollection
of
utter
fatigue
of
mechanical
lifting
and
falling
of
encumbered
feet
with
the
recurring
feeling
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
lift
them
any
more
all
across
that
lake
i
ate
snow
and
that
and
the
legacy
of
an
old
strain
are
my
signs
of
approaching
exhaustion
four
hours
passed
ere
we
heard
the
noise
of
dogs
and
saw
the
glimmer
of
a
light
through
the
darkness
and
the
hearts
of
men
and
beasts
alike
leaped
to
the
expectation
of
rest
and
shelter
we
had
feared
the
village
might
be
deserted
and
were
rejoiced
that
the
indians
were
still
there
never
was
hospitality
more
grateful
than
that
we
had
from
the
little
remote
band
of
natives
at
the
minchúmina
village
they
made
a
pot
of
tea
and
fried
some
for
us
and
that
was
our
supper
though
i
think
the
boys
ate
some
boiled
moose
meat
from
a
pot
on
the
stove
we
had
plenty
of
grub
but
were
too
weary
to
cook
it
we
spread
our
bedding
down
on
the
floor
amongst
a
dozen
others
and
fell
almost
at
once
into
a
deep
sleep
almost
at
once
for
the
arrival
of
our
eight
dogs
had
made
a
commotion
amongst
the
canine
population
of
the
place
that
after
repeated
outbreaks
of
noisy
animosity
and
defiance
seemed
to
turn
by
common
consent
into
a
friendly
and
most
protracted
howling
contest
in
which
my
malamute
muk
plainly
outdid
all
competitors
how
much
longer
the
noise
would
have
kept
up
it
is
hard
to
say
dogs
never
seem
too
tired
to
howl
but
when
the
limit
of
indian
patience
was
reached
an
aged
crone
rolled
out
of
the
bed
into
which
she
had
rolled
all
standing
seized
a
staff
and
went
outdoors
to
lay
it
impartially
upon
the
backs
of
all
the
disturbers
of
the
peace
domestic
and
foreign
with
a
screech
that
was
as
formidable
as
the
blows
the
rest
was
silence
the
next
morning
a
dozen
went
off
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
every
adult
in
that
cabin
owned
a
separate
and
rose
one
supposes
to
the
summons
of
no
other
timepiece
at
any
rate
the
clocks
went
off
at
intervals
and
the
natives
arose
one
by
one
and
seemed
hugely
to
enjoy
the
clatter
let
one
purchase
a
new
thing
and
every
individual
in
the
community
must
have
one
also
but
what
struck
me
instantly
upon
arising
was
the
miraculous
transformation
that
had
taken
place
outdoors
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
through
a
clear
sky
i
hastened
to
dress
and
not
waiting
for
breakfast
seized
my
camera
and
started
out
the
chinook
was
over
the
sharp
welcome
tang
of
frost
was
in
the
air
the
snow
was
hard
underfoot
out
upon
the
gleaming
surface
of
the
lake
i
went
for
nigh
a
mile
resolutely
refusing
to
look
behind
i
knew
what
vision
awaited
me
when
i
turned
around
had
indeed
caught
a
slight
glimpse
as
i
left
the
cabin
and
i
wanted
the
smooth
open
foreground
of
the
lake
that
i
might
see
it
to
the
best
advantage
sidenote
denali
and
his
wife
there
is
probably
no
other
view
of
north
america
greatest
mountain
group
comparable
to
that
from
lake
minchúmina
from
almost
every
other
coign
of
vantage
in
the
interior
i
had
seen
it
and
found
it
more
or
less
unsatisfying
only
from
distant
points
like
the
pedro
dome
or
the
summit
between
rampart
and
glen
gulch
does
the
whole
mass
and
uplift
of
it
come
into
view
with
dignity
and
impressiveness
at
close
range
the
peaks
seem
stunted
and
inconspicuous
their
rounded
retreating
slopes
lacking
strong
lines
and
decided
character
but
from
the
lake
the
precipitous
western
face
of
denali
and
denali
wife
rise
sheer
revealed
by
the
level
foreground
of
the
snow
from
base
to
summit
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
scene
there
stood
the
master
peak
seeming
a
stupendous
vertical
wall
of
rock
rising
twenty
thousand
feet
to
a
splendid
sharp
crest
perhaps
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
away
there
a
little
farther
to
the
south
rose
the
companion
mass
a
smaller
but
still
enormous
elevation
of
equally
savage
inaccessibility
while
between
them
near
the
base
little
sharp
peaks
stretched
like
a
corridor
of
ruined
arches
from
mass
to
mass
one
was
struck
at
once
by
the
simple
appropriateness
of
the
native
names
for
these
mountains
the
master
peak
is
denali
the
great
one
the
lesser
peak
is
denali
wife
and
the
little
peaks
between
are
the
children
and
my
indignation
kindled
at
the
substitution
of
modern
names
for
these
ancient
mountain
names
bestowed
immemorially
by
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
land
is
it
too
late
to
strike
mount
mckinley
and
mount
foraker
from
the
map
the
names
were
given
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
ago
only
by
one
who
saw
them
no
nearer
than
a
hundred
miles
is
it
too
late
to
restore
the
native
names
contemptuously
displaced
the
majesty
of
the
scene
grew
upon
me
as
i
gazed
and
presently
hand
went
to
camera
that
some
record
of
it
might
be
attempted
but
alas
for
the
limitations
of
photography
i
knew
even
as
i
made
the
exposures
first
at
one
of
a
second
and
then
at
that
there
was
little
hope
of
securing
a
picture
the
air
was
yet
faintly
hazy
with
thin
vapour
the
early
sun
made
too
acute
an
angle
with
the
peaks
and
the
yellow
lens
screen
was
left
in
the
of
the
sled
it
was
even
as
i
feared
when
developed
some
months
later
the
film
held
absolutely
no
trace
of
the
mighty
mountains
that
had
risen
so
proudly
before
it
i
promised
myself
that
at
noon
when
the
sun
had
removed
to
a
greater
distance
from
the
mountains
and
made
a
more
favourable
angle
with
them
i
would
return
and
try
again
but
by
noon
had
come
another
sudden
violent
change
of
the
weather
and
snow
was
falling
once
more
sidenote
the
minchúmina
folk
so
i
got
no
picture
save
the
picture
indelibly
impressed
upon
my
memory
of
the
noblest
mountain
scene
i
had
ever
gazed
upon
which
made
memorable
this
of
march
perhaps
one
of
the
noblest
mountain
scenes
in
the
whole
world
for
one
does
not
recall
another
so
great
uplift
from
so
low
a
base
the
marshy
flat
country
that
stretches
from
minchúmina
to
the
mountains
can
not
be
much
more
than
one
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
those
awful
precipices
dropping
thousands
of
feet
at
a
leap
those
peaks
rising
serene
and
everlasting
into
the
highest
heaven
the
overwhelming
size
and
strength
and
solidity
of
their
rocky
bulk
all
this
sank
into
my
heart
and
there
sprang
up
once
again
the
passionate
desire
of
exploring
the
bowels
of
them
of
creeping
along
their
glaciers
and
up
their
icy
ridges
of
penetrating
their
hidden
chambers
inviolate
since
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
maybe
scaling
their
ultimate
summits
and
looking
down
upon
all
the
earth
even
as
they
look
down
men
however
and
not
mountains
made
the
immediate
demand
upon
interest
and
attention
and
i
returned
to
breakfast
and
the
duties
of
the
day
the
minchúmina
people
are
a
very
feeble
folk
some
sixteen
all
told
at
the
time
of
our
visit
greatly
reduced
by
the
epidemics
of
the
last
decade
living
remote
from
all
others
on
the
verge
of
their
habitat
they
trade
chiefly
at
tanana
a
hundred
and
thirty
miles
or
so
away
walking
an
annual
trip
thither
with
their
furs
and
owning
a
nominal
allegiance
to
our
mission
at
that
place
it
was
the
first
time
that
any
clergyman
had
ever
visited
them
and
the
whole
of
the
day
was
spent
with
them
discovering
what
they
knew
and
trying
to
teach
them
a
little
more
the
people
sat
around
on
the
floor
and
hung
upon
the
lips
of
the
interpreter
but
what
a
barrier
a
difference
of
language
is
an
interpreter
is
like
a
mountain
pass
a
means
of
access
but
at
the
cost
of
time
and
labour
he
does
not
remove
the
obstruction
the
minchúmina
people
occupy
a
fine
country
that
could
amply
support
ten
times
the
indian
population
that
now
inhabits
it
we
were
indeed
now
entering
a
country
that
has
been
almost
depopulated
by
successive
epidemics
of
contagious
diseases
the
measles
in
slew
most
of
them
and
diphtheria
in
destroyed
all
the
children
and
many
of
the
adults
that
remained
the
chief
of
this
little
band
wore
a
hat
proudly
adorned
with
ribbons
and
plumes
and
flew
a
flag
before
his
dwelling
with
the
initials
of
the
north
american
trading
and
transportation
company
on
it
a
defunct
alaskan
corporation
we
could
not
learn
the
origin
thereof
the
flag
and
the
letters
were
plainly
it
was
probably
a
mere
imitation
of
a
flag
he
had
seen
years
ago
at
tanana
copied
without
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
the
letters
as
the
esquimaux
often
copy
into
the
decoration
of
their
clothing
and
equipment
the
legends
from
canned
foods
lake
minchúmina
drains
by
a
fork
of
the
kantishna
river
into
the
tanana
and
so
into
the
yukon
just
beyond
the
southwestern
edge
of
the
lake
runs
a
deep
gully
for
perhaps
a
mile
that
leads
to
another
lake
called
tsórmina
which
drains
into
minchúmina
and
just
beyond
tsórmina
is
a
little
height
of
land
on
the
other
side
of
which
lies
lake
sishwóymina
which
drains
into
the
kuskokwim
so
that
little
height
of
land
is
another
watershed
between
alaska
two
great
rivers
lakes
tsórmina
and
sishwóymina
are
not
on
any
maps
indeed
this
region
has
never
been
mapped
save
very
crudely
from
the
distant
flanks
of
denali
upon
one
of
alfred
brook
early
bold
journeys
into
the
interior
of
alaska
on
behalf
of
the
geological
survey
although
the
russians
had
establishments
on
the
lower
kuskokwim
years
ago
and
the
river
is
the
second
largest
in
alaska
and
easy
of
navigation
yet
the
white
man
had
penetrated
very
little
into
this
country
until
the
innoko
and
iditarod
strikes
of
and
respectively
it
was
our
plan
to
follow
the
main
valley
of
the
kuskokwim
until
the
confluence
of
the
takotna
with
that
stream
just
below
the
junction
of
the
main
north
and
south
forks
of
the
kuskokwim
and
then
strike
northwestward
across
country
to
the
iditarod
the
snow
had
passed
and
the
sun
was
bright
and
the
thermometer
around
zero
all
day
when
we
left
minchúmina
to
pursue
our
journey
the
welcome
change
in
the
weather
had
brought
a
still
more
welcome
change
in
travel
the
decided
and
continued
thaw
followed
by
sharp
cold
had
put
a
crust
on
the
snow
that
would
hold
up
the
dogs
and
the
sled
and
a
man
on
small
trail
anywhere
trail
making
was
no
longer
necessary
and
in
two
days
we
made
upward
of
fifty
miles
so
much
difference
does
surface
make
sidenote
talida
across
the
end
of
lake
minchúmina
across
tsórmina
and
sishwóymina
and
a
number
of
lesser
lakes
we
went
following
a
faint
trail
towards
a
distant
mountain
group
to
the
southwest
the
talida
mountains
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
talida
village
on
the
other
hand
to
the
east
and
southeast
we
had
tantalising
glimpses
through
haze
and
cloud
of
the
two
great
mountains
and
presently
of
the
lesser
peaks
of
the
whole
alaskan
range
sweeping
its
proud
curve
to
the
coast
for
a
long
way
on
the
second
day
we
travelled
on
the
flat
top
of
a
narrow
ridge
that
must
surely
have
been
a
lateral
moraine
of
a
glacier
what
time
the
ice
poured
down
from
the
heights
and
stretched
far
over
this
valley
then
through
scattered
timber
increasing
in
size
and
thickness
and
already
displaying
character
that
differed
somewhat
from
the
familiar
forests
of
the
yukon
the
trail
we
were
following
was
made
by
a
messenger
despatched
by
the
minchúmina
people
to
invite
the
talida
people
to
a
potlatch
for
the
caches
were
filled
with
moose
meat
beyond
local
consumption
early
on
the
second
day
we
met
him
returning
and
learned
that
he
had
gone
on
to
yet
another
village
a
day
journey
farther
still
on
our
route
the
people
were
all
gone
hunting
from
the
tiny
native
hamlet
of
talida
but
we
entered
a
cabin
and
made
ourselves
at
home
we
had
passed
into
the
region
where
the
greek
church
holds
nominal
sway
of
which
the
icons
with
little
candles
before
them
on
the
walls
gave
token
no
priest
ever
visits
them
but
a
native
at
a
village
on
the
south
fork
where
is
a
church
holds
some
position
analogous
to
that
of
a
lay
reader
the
nearest
priest
is
a
ill
spoken
of
for
irregularity
of
life
some
two
hundred
miles
farther
down
the
river
the
greek
church
is
relaxing
its
hold
in
alaska
perhaps
inevitably
and
suffers
sadly
since
the
removal
of
the
bishop
from
sitka
from
lack
of
supervision
also
we
had
passed
out
of
indian
country
into
the
land
of
the
esquimaux
for
these
people
far
up
towards
the
head
of
the
river
as
they
were
had
yet
come
at
some
period
from
the
mouth
we
were
out
of
walter
language
range
now
and
were
glad
that
the
bilingual
john
of
the
march
country
was
with
us
to
serve
as
interpreter
standing
proudly
up
against
the
wall
in
one
corner
of
the
cabin
was
a
rather
pathetic
object
to
my
eyes
an
elaborate
silk
umbrella
there
needed
no
one
to
tell
its
story
it
spoke
of
a
visit
to
the
yukon
with
furs
to
sell
and
the
usual
foolish
purchase
of
gay
and
glittering
trash
novel
and
quite
useless
what
easy
prey
these
poor
people
are
to
the
wiles
of
the
trader
said
one
of
them
to
me
recently
when
i
asked
the
purpose
of
an
annex
to
his
store
with
a
huge
in
it
at
an
exclusive
native
village
it
to
get
their
money
there
no
use
trying
to
fool
you
if
we
ca
get
it
one
way
we
got
to
get
it
another
this
gorgeous
silk
umbrella
was
concrete
expression
of
the
same
sentiment
it
was
bought
outside
it
was
brought
into
the
country
it
was
set
on
exhibition
in
the
store
because
some
trader
judged
it
likely
to
attract
a
native
eye
no
one
white
or
native
uses
an
umbrella
in
interior
alaska
we
made
miles
the
next
day
through
a
wide
open
country
well
wooded
in
places
with
a
distribution
of
trees
unwonted
in
our
travels
and
attractive
a
new
species
of
spruce
threw
thick
branches
right
down
to
the
ground
and
tapered
up
to
a
perfect
cone
each
tree
apart
from
the
others
and
surrounded
by
sward
instead
of
underbrush
there
was
a
dignity
about
these
trees
that
the
common
yukon
spruce
never
attains
rolling
hills
of
small
elevation
stretched
on
either
hand
and
game
signs
abounded
after
eight
hours
of
such
travel
we
spoke
of
camping
but
presently
saw
footprints
in
the
snow
and
pushed
on
to
the
bank
of
a
little
river
the
chedolothna
where
stood
a
cabin
a
tent
and
several
high
caches
here
with
two
families
that
occupied
the
cabin
we
stayed
the
night
sidenote

and
diphtheria

people
at
this
place

perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
square
yet
it
is
a
noble
indian
country
one
of
the
most
favourable
in
all
the
interior
capable
of
supporting
hundreds
of
people
signs
indeed
of
a
much
larger
occupation
of
it
were
not
wanting
and
all
accounts
speak
of
the
wholesale
destruction
of
the
natives
by
disease
we
were
told
of
a
village
a
little
farther
up
this
stream
where
every
living
being
save
one
old
man
died
of
diphtheria
five
years
previously
while
those
who
have
heard
the
stories
of
the
horrors
of
the
epidemic
of
measles
in
usually
connected
in
some
way
with
the
stampede
to
nome
of
that
year
when
the
disease
seems
to
have
entered
the
country
will
understand
how
a
region
once
thickly
peopled
for
alaska
has
become
the
most
thinly
peopled
in
all
the
territory
a
trader
long
resident
at
a
point
perhaps
two
hundred
miles
lower
down
the
kuskokwim
told
me
of
coming
back
to
a
populous
village
after
an
absence
of
a
few
weeks
to
find
every
person
dead
and
the
starving
dogs
tearing
at
the
rotting
corpses
it
is
terrible
to
think
what
the
irruption
of
a
new
disease
may
mean
to
these
primitive
natives
even
a
disease
like
measles
rarely
fatal
and
not
commonly
regarded
as
serious
amongst
whites
takes
to
itself
a
strange
and
awful
virulence
when
it
invades
this
virgin
blood
the
people
know
no
proper
treatment
maddened
by
the
itching
rash
that
covers
the
body
they
fling
off
all
cover
rush
outdoors
naked
whatever
the
weather
and
either
roll
in
the
snow
or
plunge
into
the
stream
with
the
result
that
the
disease
strikes
in
and
kills
them
such
is
the
description
that
is
given
of
its
course
along
the
lower
yukon
and
kuskokwim
at
many
a
yukon
village
half
the
people
died
despite
the
aid
the
few
missionaries
then
on
the
river
could
afford
upon
the
kuskokwim
the
havoc
seems
to
have
been
still
greater
six
years
later
death
again
stalked
through
this
region
after
having
visited
the
yukon
and
this
time
seized
his
victims
by
the
throat
in
another
chapter
has
been
given
some
account
of
an
outbreak
of
diphtheria
on
the
chandalar
following
a
more
serious
epidemic
at
circle
city
and
fort
yukon
it
was
during
that
same
winter
the
disease
raged
in
this
region
remote
from
any
sort
of
medical
or
even
intelligent
lay
aid
and
swept
off
all
the
children
that
had
been
spared
by
the
measles
or
had
been
born
since
that
time
at
our
next
we
saw
the
graves
of
nineteen
children
who
died
in
one
day
sidenote
the
indian
guide
we
learned
that
we
were
now
within
one
day
travel
of
a
at
or
near
the
junction
of
the
forks
of
the
kuskokwim
and
that
a
government
trail
had
been
surveyed
and
staked
from
the
iditarod
to
the
sushitna
passing
close
to
the
same
point
and
that
during
the
present
winter
had
sprung
up
along
the
western
portion
of
it
so
that
we
should
not
have
to
make
camp
again
on
the
way
to
iditarod
city
all
of
which
minchúmina
john
had
collected
from
the
people
in
the
cabin
and
now
presented
to
me
as
reason
why
he
should
be
released
from
further
service
i
was
loath
to
let
him
go
until
we
were
actually
the
described
but
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
lake
for
the
potlatch
then
preparing
and
said
that
two
days
delay
would
bar
him
from
the
best
of
the
festivities
so
i
settled
with
him
giving
him
fifty
dollars
of
the
sixty
dollars
covenanted
to
the
iditarod
and
grub
enough
to
take
him
back
to
the
lake
and
a
rifle
for
he
was
unprovided
with
firearms
and
he
went
his
way
back
richly
content
to
the
gorging
of
unlimited
moose
meat
that
awaited
him
and
the
boy
and
i
went
ours
so
far
as
merely
his
company
was
concerned
i
was
not
sorry
to
lose
him
the
old
saying
holds
good
upon
the
trail
that
two
is
company
and
three
is
none
he
interfered
with
my
boy
lessons
since
he
had
scarce
any
english
and
could
not
be
ignored
the
conversation
was
mainly
in
indian
in
a
word
he
pulled
the
company
down
to
a
native
level
and
i
was
anxious
that
education
should
proceed
this
boy
had
been
with
me
for
two
years
winter
and
summer
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
witness
his
gracious
development
of
body
mind
and
character
slender
and
supple
his
indian
blood
showing
chiefly
in
a
slight
swarth
of
complexion
and
aquilinity
of
feature
he
now
approached
his
twentieth
year
and
began
to
gain
the
strength
of
his
manhood
and
to
give
promise
of
more
than
the
average
stature
and
physical
power
with
only
one
full
year
schooling
behind
him
the
year
before
he
came
to
me
his
active
intelligence
had
made
such
quick
use
of
it
that
there
was
good
foundation
to
build
upon
and
our
desultory
lessons
in
camp
reading
aloud
writing
from
dictation
geography
and
history
in
such
snippets
as
circumstances
permitted
were
eagerly
made
the
most
of
and
his
mental
horizon
broadened
continually
until
his
sixteenth
year
he
had
lived
amongst
the
indians
almost
exclusively
and
had
little
english
and
could
not
read
nor
write
he
was
adept
in
all
wilderness
arts
an
axe
a
rifle
a
flaying
knife
a
skin
needle
with
its
sinew
thread
with
all
these
he
was
at
home
he
could
construct
a
sled
or
a
pair
of
going
to
the
woods
for
his
birch
drying
it
and
steaming
it
and
bending
it
and
could
pitch
camp
with
all
the
native
comforts
and
amenities
as
quickly
as
anybody
i
ever
saw
he
spoke
the
naked
truth
and
was
so
gentle
and
unobtrusive
in
manner
that
he
was
a
welcome
guest
at
the
table
of
any
mission
we
visited
miss
farthing
at
nenana
had
laid
her
mark
deep
upon
him
in
the
one
year
he
was
with
her
sidenote
the
before
he
came
to
me
i
had
another
for
two
years
and
before
that
there
had
been
a
series
of
native
boys
i
found
the
greatly
preferable
with
full
command
of
the
native
language
with
such
insight
into
the
native
mind
as
few
white
men
ever
attain
he
combines
the
white
man
quickness
of
apprehension
and
desire
for
knowledge
and
the
companionship
had
been
pleasant
and
profitable
both
these
boys
had
picked
up
quickly
and
efficiently
without
the
slightest
previous
experience
the
running
and
the
care
of
the
gasoline
engine
of
the
mission
launch
and
took
a
great
and
intelligent
interest
in
all
machinery
as
an
interpreter
the
is
far
superior
to
most
he
takes
one
purport
immediately
his
mind
seems
to
leap
with
the
speaker
mind
not
only
to
follow
faithfully
but
to
anticipate
and
the
further
his
english
progresses
so
much
the
more
excellent
interpreter
does
he
become
my
heart
goes
out
to
the
large
and
rapidly
increasing
number
of
these
youths
of
mixed
blood
in
alaska
it
is
common
to
hear
them
spoken
of
slightingly
and
contemptuously
there
is
what
my
mind
always
regards
as
a
damnable
epigram
current
in
the
country
to
the
effect
that
the
inherits
the
vices
of
both
races
and
the
virtues
of
neither
the
white
man
who
utters
this
saying
with
a
chuckle
at
his
wit
has
generally
not
much
virtue
to
transmit
were
virtue
heritable
but
to
thoughtful
men
nowadays
this
talk
of
the
inheritance
of
virtues
and
vices
is
mere
folly
the
in
alaska
as
elsewhere
is
the
product
of
his
environment
often
without
legitimate
father
although
in
an
indian
community
where
nothing
is
secret
his
parentage
is
usually
well
known
he
is
left
for
some
native
woman
to
support
with
the
aid
of
her
native
husband
he
is
reared
with
the
offspring
of
the
couple
in
the
frankness
that
knows
no
reserve
and
the
intimacy
that
knows
no
restraint
of
indian
life
the
full
extent
of
that
frankness
and
intimacy
shocks
even
the
white
man
when
he
first
becomes
aware
of
it
where
religion
and
decency
have
not
been
faithfully
inculcated
there
is
no
bound
to
it
at
all
it
is
complete
presently
as
his
superior
intellectual
inheritance
begins
to
manifest
itself
as
he
grows
up
into
consciousness
that
he
is
different
from
and
in
many
ways
superior
to
the
indians
around
him
he
is
naturally
drawn
to
such
white
society
as
comes
his
way
sidenote
the
white
in
this
book
a
good
deal
has
been
said
and
it
may
be
thought
by
the
reader
said
with
a
good
deal
of
asperity
about
the
whites
who
frequent
indian
communities
and
come
most
into
contact
with
the
native
people
yet
the
more
the
author
sees
of
this
class
the
less
is
he
disposed
to
modify
any
of
the
strictures
he
has
put
upon
it
the
white
is
the
subject
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
and
scathing
of
robert
ballads
those
most
unequal
productions
with
their
mixture
of
strength
and
feebleness
of
true
and
forced
notes
the
best
of
which
should
certainly
live
amongst
the
scant
literature
of
the
north
and
indeed
the
spectacle
of
the
man
of
the
higher
race
with
all
the
traditions
and
habits
of
civilisation
behind
him
descending
below
the
level
of
the
savage
corrupting
and
debauching
the
savage
and
making
this
corrupting
and
debauching
the
sole
exercise
of
his
more
intelligent
and
cultivated
mind
is
one
that
has
aroused
the
disgust
and
indignation
of
whites
in
all
quarters
of
the
world
kipling
and
conrad
have
drawn
him
in

east

any

officer
will
draw
him
for
you
in
the
philippines
which
lack
as
yet
their
great
delineator
service
has
not
overdrawn
him
on
the
yukon
now
it
is
to
this
man
society
for
lack
of
other
white
society
open
to
him
that
the
young
who
feels
his
father
blood
stirring
within
him
is
drawn
and
is
made
welcome
he
finds
standards
even
lower
because
more
sophisticated
than
the
standards
of
the
indians
themselves
he
finds
that
honesty
and
morality
are
a
sham
religion
a
he
finds
the
chastity
of
women
and
the
honour
of
men
sneeringly
regarded
as
he
is
taught
to
curse
and
swear
to
talk
lewdly
to
drink
and
gamble
he
is
taught
that
drunkenness
and
sensuality
are
the
only
enjoyments
worth
looking
forward
to
and
he
soon
becomes
as
vile
as
his
preceptors
the
back
room
of
the
indian
store
is
often
the
scene
of
this
tuition
barroom
assignation
house
gambling
hell
in
one
but
let
that
same
youth
be
taken
early
in
hand
by
one
who
has
a
care
for
him
and
will
be
at
some
personal
pains
to
train
him
cleanly
and
uprightly
and
he
is
as
amenable
to
the
good
influences
as
he
would
be
to
the
bad
if
they
were
his
sole
environment
conscious
all
the
time
of
his
equivocal
position
shy
and
timid
about
asserting
himself
amongst
whites
he
is
easy
prey
to
the
viciously
as
he
is
apt
pupil
to
the
virtuously
disposed
what
is
said
here
of
the
male
applies
to
the
female
unless
early
taken
in
hand
by
the
missionary
or
put
under
the
protection
of
some
church
and
sometimes
despite
all
such
care
and
teaching
the
lot
of
the
girl
is
a
sad
one
and
some
of
the
lowest
and
vilest
women
of
the
land
are
of
mixed
blood
the
is
assuredly
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
future
of
alaska
he
is
here
to
stay
he
is
here
in
increasing
numbers
he
is
the
natural
leader
of
the
indian
population
there
seems
little
doubt
that
when
he
cares
to
assert
his
rights
he
is
already
an
american
citizen
although
judicial
decisions
are
uncertain
and
conflicting
in
this
matter
the
missions
in
the
interior
have
recognised
though
perhaps
somewhat
tardily
the
importance
of
the
and
have
picked
them
up
here
and
there
along
the
rivers
and
become
responsible
for
their
decent
rearing
some
assuredly
of
the
future
leaders
of
the
native
people
are
now
in
training
at
the
mission
schools
some
unfortunately
are
in
quite
as
assiduous
training
by
the
unscrupulous
indian
trader
and
his
coterie
of
whites
the
skies
had
threatened
snow
since
we
arose
and
when
our
diminished
expedition
was
well
upon
its
way
the
snow
began
to
fall
for
hours
it
fell
without
cessation
three
days
of
good
travel
had
put
us
forward
or
eighty
miles
now
once
more
we
were
up
against
deep
snow
and
trail
breaking
an
old
native
whom
we
met
on
his
way
to
the
potlatch
later
in
the
day
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
look
of
despair
and
cried
good
trail
all
lose
all
day
we
pushed
on
against
the
driving
storm
the
flakes
stinging
our
faces
and
striking
painfully
against
our
eyeballs
now
following
a
narrow
steep
woodland
trail
now
awhile
along
a
creek
bed
now
across
open
country
with
increasing
difficulty
in
finding
our
way
until
it
grew
dark
while
yet
we
were
some
miles
from
our
destination
and
we
made
camp
and
all
night
long
the
heavy
snow
continued
so
soon
as
we
had
struck
our
tent
crusted
with
ice
and
had
broken
up
our
wet
camp
next
morning
there
was
trouble
about
finding
the
trail
wide
open
spaces
with
never
an
indication
of
direction
stretched
before
us
again
and
again
we
cast
about
the
boy
to
the
left
i
to
the
right
to
find
some
blaze
or
mark
but
much
of
the
course
lay
across
open
country
that
bore
none
and
then
i
sorely
regretted
having
let
john
go
back
some
miles
before
we
came
to
a
stop
the
previous
evening
we
passed
a
native
encampment
with
naught
but
women
and
children
in
it
the
men
gone
hunting
but
we
could
not
speak
with
them
or
get
any
information
from
them
for
our
kuskokwim
interpreter
was
gone
and
now
it
seemed
likely
that
we
should
lose
our
way
in
this
wilderness
at
last
we
were
entirely
at
a
loss
the
boy
returning
on
the
one
side
and
i
on
the
other
from
wide
detours
in
which
we
had
found
no
sign
at
all
the
snow
still
fell
heavily
there
lay
more
than
a
foot
of
it
upon
the
late
crust
trail
or
sign
of
a
trail
on
the
snow
or
above
it
was
not
at
all
sidenote
the
dog
guides
then
occurred
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
i
have
known
in
all
my
journeyings
straight
ahead
in
the
middle
distance
i
spied
two
stray
dogs
making
a
direct
course
towards
us
not
wandering
about
but
evidently
going
somewhere
now
there
are
no
such
things
as
unattached
dogs
in
alaska
any
dog
entirely
detached
from
human
ownership
and
some
sort
of
human
maintenance
would
soon
be
a
dead
dog
the
explanation
full
of
hope
sprang
at
once
to
the
boy
mind
the
dogs
must
belong
to
the
native
encampment
some
six
miles
back
and
they
had
been
to
the
for
what
scraps
they
could
pick
up
and
were
returning
it
was
probably
a
daily
excursion
and
they
had
doubtless
followed
their
accustomed
trail
so
it
turned
out
all
the
way
to
that
eight
miles
farther
we
followed
the
trail
left
by
those
dogs
growing
fainter
and
fainter
indeed
as
the
new
snow
fell
upon
it
but
still
discernible
until
we
had
almost
reached
the
it
led
across
open
swampy
wastes
and
presently
across
two
considerable
lakes
over
which
we
should
never
have
been
able
to
find
our
way
for
the
trail
swung
to
one
hand
or
the
other
and
did
not
leave
the
lake
in
the
same
general
direction
by
which
it
had
reached
it
walter
cut
a
bundle
of
boughs
and
staked
the
trail
out
as
we
pursued
it
lest
we
should
return
this
way
but
from
the
moment
we
saw
the
dogs
there
was
never
any
question
about
the
trail
they
kept
it
perfectly
we
were
four
and
a
half
hours
making
the
eight
miles
or
so
to
nicoli
village
and
the
but
we
might
have
been
days
making
it
but
for
those
dogs
and
at
the
we
learned
that
the
boy
theory
of
their
movements
was
the
right
one
they
came
across
the
twelve
or
fourteen
miles
every
day
for
such
scraps
as
they
could
pick
up
sidenote
the
wilderness
poet
so
here
was
our
first
white
man
in
sixteen
days
an
intelligent
man
of
meagre
education
with
a
great
bent
for
versifying
a
courteous
approval
of
one
set
of
verse
brought
upon
us
the
accumulated
output
of
years
in
the
wilderness
without
much
opportunity
of
audience
as
one
supposes
and
most
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
was
thus
spent
amidst
the
overwrought
sentimentality
and
faulty
scansion
which
marked
most
of
the
pieces
was
one
simple
little
poem
that
struck
a
true
note
said
its
little
say
and
quit
without
a
superfluous
word
its
author
set
no
store
by
it
at
all
compared
with
his
more
pretentious
and
meretricious
work
yet
it
was
the
one
poem
in
the
whole
mass
it
described
the
writing
of
a
letter
to
his
father
he
had
spent
all
he
had
in
prospecting
and
working
a
small
claim
and
had
just
realised
that
a
year
labour
was
gone
for
naught
his
father
would
worry
if
he
got
no
word
at
all
but
there
was
no
use
telling
the
old
man
he
was
broke
so
he
just
wrote
that
he
was
well
and
that
was
all
the
old
man
would
come
pretty
near
understanding
anyway
in
simple
lines
that
scanned
and
rhymed
naturally
that
was
what
the
three
or
four
stanzas
said
and
it
was
so
typical
of
many
a
man
situation
in
this
country
gave
so
simply
and
well
the
reason
why
many
men
cease
writing
to
their
relatives
at
all
that
it
pleased
me
and
seemed
of
value
that
note
came
from
the
heart
and
from
the
life
experience
nicoli
village
is
a
very
small
place
with
a
mere
handful
of
people
situated
on
the
south
fork
of
the
kuskokwim
some
forty
miles
by
river
above
the
junction
of
the
forks
before
the
epidemics
devastated
it
it
had
been
a
considerable
native
community
a
greek
church
which
the
natives
built
entirely
themselves
and
which
boasted
a
large
painted
icon
of
sorts
was
the
most
important
building
in
the
place
and
was
served
by
the
lay
minister
referred
to
before
thus
far
the
kuskokwim
is
navigable
for
vessels
of
light
draught
and
a
small
steamboat
lay
wintering
upon
the
bank
sidenote
our
way
now
left
the
kuskokwim
and
struck
across
country
to
a
point
just
below
the
junction
of
the
forks
and
then
across
country
again
to
a
tributary
of
the
right
bank
the
takotna
with
a
general
northerly
direction
there
indeed
were
in
the
crudity
and
discomfort
of
their
first
season
and
other
evidences
of
the
proximity
of
the
white
man
here
were
two
men
camped
hunting
moose
for
the
iditarod
market
more
than
a
hundred
and
miles
away
and
here
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
near
the
mouth
of
the
takotna
was
the
new
post
of
the
commercial
company
in
the
charge
of
an
old
acquaintance
who
welcomed
us
warmly
and
entertained
us
most
hospitably
after
camping
and
experience
of
nearly
three
weeks
a
comfortable
bed
and
table
and
the
general
unmistakable
ménage
of
a
woman
are
very
highly
enjoyed
that
night
the
whole
population
of
the
settlement
fourteen
persons
gathered
in
the
store
for
divine
service
sixteen
miles
farther
on
was
another
settlement
the
upper
takotna
post
with
a
rival
company
established
and
some
larger
population
here
also
we
spent
a
night
with
old
fairbanks
acquaintances
we
were
yet
a
hundred
miles
from
iditarod
city
and
the
trail
lay
over
a
very
rugged
hilly
country
up
one
creek
to
its
head
over
a
divide
and
down
another
in
the
way
of
the
usual
traverse
there
had
not
been
so
much
snowfall
in
this
section
but
the
weather
began
to
be
very
severe
the
thermometer
fell
to
and
and
on
three
successive
nights
and
all
day
long
rose
not
above
with
a
keen
wind
the
cost
of
transporting
supplies
to
the
on
this
trail
justified
the
high
prices
charged
one
dollar
and
a
half
for
a
poor
meal
of
rabbits
and
beans
and
bacon
or
ptarmigan
and
beans
and
bacon
and
one
dollar
for
a
lunch
of
coffee
bread
and
butter
and
dried
fruit
but
no
such
exigency
could
be
pleaded
to
excuse
the
dirt
and
discomfort
and
lack
of
the
commonest
provision
of
outhouse
decency
at
most
of
these
places
was
mere
shiftlessness
there
is
not
often
much
middle
ground
in
alaskan
they
are
either
very
good
in
their
way
or
very
bad
either
kept
by
professional
victuallers
who
take
pride
in
them
or
by
idle
incompetents
who
make
an
easy
living
out
of
the
necessities
of
travellers
one
wishes
that
some
of
the
travellers
who
used
to
wax
so
eloquently
indignant
over
the
inns
in
the
pyrenees
could
make
a
winter
journey
in
the
interior
of
alaska
illustration

pursues
a
hogback
ridge
for
a

and
a
half
at
the

level
illustration
a
street
in
iditarod
city
one
thing
pleased
me
at
these
the
only
in
any
of
them
consisted
of
magazines
bearing
the
rubber
stamp
of
saint
matthew
at
fairbanks
part
of
a
cargo
of
magazines
which
the
mission
launch
brought
to
the
iditarod
the
previous
summer
virtually
the
only
in
the
whole
camp
it
was
pleasant
to
know
that
we
had
been
able
to
avert
the
real
calamity
of
a
total
absence
of
anything
to
read
for
a
whole
winter
throughout
this
wide
district
but
although
they
were
brought
to
the
iditarod
and
distributed
absolutely
free
each
of
these
magazines
had
cost
the
keeper
cents
for
carriage
over
the
trail
from
iditarod
city
and
they
had
been
read
to
death
some
of
them
were
so
black
and
greasy
from
continued
handling
that
the
print
at
the
edges
of
the
pages
was
almost
unreadable
these
creeks
swarmed
with
ptarmigan
and
it
was
well
they
did
for
the
new
camp
was
ill
supplied
with
food
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
region
of
growing
scarcity
as
we
approached
the
iditarod
the
ptarmigan
seem
to
have
supplemented
the
meagre
stocks
in
the
iditarod
during
this
winter
of
as
effectively
as
the
rabbits
did
in
the
fairbanks
camp
in
the
scarce
winter
of
in
place
after
place
the
whole
creek
valley
where
it
was
open
was
crisscrossed
with
ptarmigan
tracks
and
the
birds
rose
in
coveys
uttering
their
harsh
guttural
cry
at
every
turn
of
the
trail
the
summit
between
the
head
of
moose
creek
and
the
head
of
bonanza
creek
is
again
a
watershed
between
the
waters
of
the
kuskokwim
and
the
waters
of
the
yukon
for
moose
creek
is
tributary
to
the
takotna
and
bonanza
creek
is
tributary
to
otter
creek
which
is
tributary
to
the
iditarod
river
the
summit
is
high
above
and
when
the
trail
has
reached
it
it
does
not
descend
immediately
but
pursues
a
hogback
ridge
for
a
mile
and
a
half
at
about
the
summit
level
we
passed
over
it
in
clear
bright
weather
without
difficulty
but
it
would
be
a
bad
passage
in
wind
or
snow
or
fog
the
rugged
broken
country
with
small
rounded
domes
of
hills
stretched
away
in
all
directions
a
maze
of
little
valleys
threading
in
and
out
amongst
them
sidenote
the
bonanza
creek
was
by
far
the
best
of
any
between
the
kuskokwim
and
the
iditarod
and
showed
what
can
be
done
for
comfort
even
under
adverse
circumstances
by
a
couple
who
care
and
try
but
how
the
names
of
creeks
or
creeks
that
are
expected
to
be
are
repeated
again
and
again
in
every
new
camp
i
once
counted
up
the
following
list
of
mining
in
alaska
bonanza
creeks
eldorados
and
little
eldorados
nugget
creeks
or
gulches
gold
creeks
gold
runs
nor
is
it
only
in
creeks
with
auriferous
deposit
or
expectation
of
auriferous
deposit
that
this
reduplication
occurs
there
are
bear
creeks
boulder
creeks
moose
creeks
willow
creeks
canyon
creeks
glacier
creeks
the
imagination
of
the
average
prospector
is
not
his
most
active
faculty
but
even
when
his
imagination
is
given
play
and
he
names
a
place
twilight
as
he
did
the
original
settlement
at
this
base
of
supplies
the
ineradicable
prose
of
trade
comes
along
the
next
summer
and
changes
it
to
iditarod
city
there
must
have
been
some
remarkable
personality
strong
enough
to
repress
the
chamber
of
commerce
at
tombstone
arizona
or
the
place
would
have
lost
its
distinctive
name
so
soon
as
it
grew
large
enough
to
have
mercantile
establishments
instead
of
stores
sidenote
iditarod
city
we
went
through
discovery
otter
and
into
flat
city
on
flat
creek
the
jealous
rival
of
iditarod
city
and
so
over
the
hills
to
iditarod
city
on
the
wings
of
a
storm
the
wind
whirled
the
snow
behind
us
and
drove
the
sled
along
almost
on
top
of
the
dogs
in
its
bleak
situation
and
its
exposure
to
the
full
force
of
the
wind
iditarod
city
reminds
one
of
nome
or
candle
on
the
seward
peninsula
the
hills
and
flats
that
surround
it
are
in
the
main
treeless
and
the
snow
drifts
and
drives
over
everything
almost
all
the
week
that
we
spent
in
the
town
it
was
smothered
up
in
a
howling
so
that
it
was
quite
a
serious
undertaking
to
walk
a
block
or
two
along
the
streets
deep
drifts
were
piled
up
on
all
the
corners
and
on
the
lee
side
of
all
buildings
we
reached
iditarod
city
on
monday
the
of
march
until
the
following
friday
morning
was
no
cessation
or
moderation
of
the
and
this
they
told
us
represented
most
of
the
weather
since
the
of
january
overgrown
and
overdone
in
every
way
the
place
presented
all
the
features
sordid
and
otherwise
of
a
raw
mining
town
prices
had
risen
enormously
on
all
manner
of
supplies
for
everything
that
was
not
actually
short
was
believed
to
be
cornered
bacon
was
ninety
cents
a
pound
butter
one
dollar
and
a
half
a
pound
flour
was
twenty
dollars
a
hundred
pounds
and
most
things
in
like
ratio
some
said
the
grub
was
not
in
the
camp
others
that
the
tradesmen
had
it
cached
away
waiting
for
the
still
higher
prices
they
believed
would
obtain
before
fresh
supplies
could
arrive
in
july
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
disappointment
and
discouragement
enhanced
by
discomfort
and
actual
suffering
from
the
terrible
stormy
weather
of
the
winter
and
the
exorbitant
and
growing
price
of
provisions
many
men
without
occupation
were
living
on
one
meal
a
day
the
saloons
and
the
parasitical
classes
male
and
female
seemed
to
flourish
and
to
play
their
usual
prominent
part
in
the
life
of
such
places
the
doings
of
notorious
women
whose
sobriquets
seemed
household
words
the
lavish
expenditures
of
certain
men
upon
them
the
presents
of
diamonds
they
received
with
the
amount
paid
for
them
constituted
a
large
part
of
the
general
talk
one
is
compelled
to
admire
the
vigour
and
enthusiastic
enterprise
daunted
by
no
difficulty
that
is
displayed
in
the
wonderfully
rapid
upraising
of
a
new
town
the
building
goes
far
ahead
of
the
known
wealth
of
the
camp
and
commonly
far
ahead
of
the
reasonable
expectation
but
the
element
of
chance
is
so
important
a
factor
in
placer
mining
that
the
whole
thing
partakes
more
of
the
nature
of
gambling
than
of
a
commercial
venture
any
new
camp
may
suddenly
present
the
world
with
a
new
klondike
with
riches
abundant
and
to
spare
for
every
one
who
is
fortunate
enough
to
be
on
the
spot
here
was
flat
creek
with
a
surprisingly
rich
deposit
why
should
there
not
be
a
dozen
such
amidst
the
multitudinous
creeks
of
the
district
how
could
any
one
know
that
it
would
be
almost
the
only
creek
on
which
pay
would
be
found
at
all
for
there
is
no
law
about
the
distribution
of
gold
deposits
there
is
not
even
a
general
rule
that
has
not
its
notable
exceptions
it
is
very
generally
believed
by
the
old
prospectors
and
miners
that
somewhere
in
the
bible
may
be
found
these
words
silver
occurs
in
veins
but
gold
is
where
you
find
it
which
of
course
is
a
mere
misreading
or
faulty
remembering
of
a
verse
in
the
book
of
job
surely
there
is
a
vein
for
the
silver
and
a
place
for
the
gold
where
they
fine
it
refine
it
but
that
gold
is
where
you
find
it
is
about
the
only
law
touching
auriferous
deposits
that
holds
universally
good
three
long
parallel
streets
of
one
and
two
story
wooden
buildings
with
cross
streets
connecting
them
made
up
the
town
because
the
country
is
poorly
timbered
the
usual
log
construction
had
yielded
in
the
main
to
framed
buildings
and
great
quantities
of
lumber
had
been
brought
the
previous
summer
from
fairbanks
and
even
from
nome
and
the
outside
to
supplement
the
output
of
two
local
mills
but
the
price
of
building
materials
had
been
very
high
and
the
average
dwelling
was
very
small
and
incommodious
people
accustomed
to
the
comparative
luxury
of
the
older
camps
had
suffered
a
good
deal
from
the
lack
of
all
domestic
conveniences
in
this
new
of
an
eldorado
so
there
the
town
stretched
away
lumber
and
paper
the
usual
alaskan
construction
stores
slap
up
against
one
another
with
no
alleyways
between
in
the
busiest
part
of
it
and
along
the
even
an
adequate
provision
of
side
streets
grudged
and
and
waiting
for
the
careless
match
and
the
fanning
wind
and
the
five
minutes
start
that
should
send
it
all
up
in
smoke
a
week
after
we
left
it
came
as
it
came
to
dawson
as
it
came
to
nome
as
it
came
to
fairbanks
without
teaching
any
lesson
or
leaving
any
precautionary
regulations
on
the
statute
book
to
save
men
from
their
own
competitive
greed
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
fire
however
it
was
all
rebuilt
and
a
plunging
local
bank
held
mortgages
on
most
of
the
structures
for
the
cost
of
the
new
material
and
holds
them
yet
sidenote
thousands
without
church
with
at
least
a
thousand
people
resident
in
the
town
not
to
mention
the
thousands
more
out
upon
the
creeks
and
at
flat
city

discovery

there
was
no
minister
of
religion
of
any
sort
in
the
whole
region
nor
had
public
divine
service
been
conducted
since
the
occasion
of
the
visit
the
previous
summer
yet
there
were
many
in
the
place
who
sorely
missed
the
opportunities
of
worship
twice
on
sunday
the
largest
dancing
hall
in
the
town
was
crowded
at
service
at
night
it
could
have
been
filled
a
second
time
with
those
unable
to
get
in
places
like
this
present
very
difficult
problems
to
those
desirous
of
providing
for
their
religious
need
to
occupy
them
at
all
they
should
be
occupied
at

when

eligible
sites
may
be
had

staking

come
into
them

at
a
high
price

what
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
shall
have
foresight
enough
to
tell
the
fortunes
of
them
the
north
is
strewn
with
cities
of
one
winter
nor
is
the
selection
of
suitable
men
to
minister
to
such
communities
a
simple
matter
amidst
the
overthrow
of

criteria
of
conduct
the
fading
out
of
the
usual
dividing

and
the
blending

a
tactful

to
keep

happy

much
stiffness
in

to
much
easiness
in
admitting

if
he

to
have
any
influence

must
not
exclude
the
point
of
view
of
the
great
majority
he
must
accept
the
situation
in

to
have
any
chance
of
improving
the
situation

yet
in
the
fundamentals
of
character
and
conduct
he
must
be
unswerving
and
if
on
any
such
fundamental
the
battle
gauge
is
thrown
down
he
must
take
it
up

fight
the
quarrel
out

left

on

the
of
march
the
dogs
the
fatter
and
fresher
for
their
week
rest
resolved
not
to
return
by
the
kuskokwim
but
to
take
the
beaten
trail
out
to
the
yukon
and
so
all
the
way
up
that
stream
to
fort
yukon
the
monthly
mail
had
arrived
a
few
days
previously
a
monthly
mail
was
all
that
the
thousands
of
men
in
this
camp
could
secure
and
had
gone
out
again
the
very
next
morning
before
people
had
time
to
answer
their
letters
before
the
registered
mail
had
even
been
delivered
so
our
departure
for
the
yukon
was
eagerly
seized
upon
and
advertised
as
a
means
of
despatching
probably
the
last
mail
that
would
go
outside
over
the
ice
i
was
sworn
in
as
special
carrier
and
a
heavy
sack
of
mail
added
to
our
load
as
far
as
tanana
the
first
stage
of
thirty
miles
led
to
dikeman
a
town
at
the
headwaters
of
ordinary
steamboat
navigation
of
the
iditarod
river
at
which
the
commercial
company
had
built
a
depot
and
extensive
warehouse
since
in
the
main
abandoned
two
streets
of
cabins
lined
the
bank
but
forty
or
fifty
souls
comprised
the
population
and
almost
all
of
them
gathered
for
divine
service
that
night
sidenote
the
moving
of
the
meat
from
dikeman
to
dishkaket
on
the
innoko
river
a
distance
of
some
seventy
miles
our
route
lay
over
one
of
the
dreariest
and
most
dismal
regions
in
all
alaska
it
is
one
succession
of
lakes
and
swamps
with
narrow
almost
ridges
between
fringed
with
stunted
spruce
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
to
right
and
left
the
country
was
the
same
it
is
safe
to
say
broadly
that
all
the
land
between
the
iditarod
and
innoko
rivers
is
of
this
character
we
passed
over
it
in
mild
weather
but
it
must
be
a
terrible
country
to
cross
in
storm
or
through
deep
snow
for
ten
miles
at
a
stretch
there
was
scarcely
a
place
where
a
man
might
make
a
decent
camp
at
a
midway
was
gathered
the
greatest
assemblage
of
dogs
and
loaded
sleds
i
had
ever
seen
together
at
one
time
each
team
with
an
indian
driver
they
must
have
covered
a
quarter
or
a
third
of
a
mile
it
was
a
freight
train
engaged
in
transporting
a
whole
of
butcher
meat
to
iditarod
city
the
cargo
of
a
steamboat
that
had
frozen
in
on
the
yukon
the
previous
october
or
early
november
all
the
winter
through
efforts
had
been
made
to
get
this
meat
two
hundred
odd
miles
overland
to
its
destination
but
the
weather
had
been
so
stormy
and
the
snow
so
deep
that
near
the
end
of
march
most
of
it
was
still
on
the
way
and
some
yet
far
down
the
trail
towards
the
yukon
waiting
for
another
trip
of
the
teams
dishkaket
was
merely
a
native
village
on
the
innoko
river
two
or
three
years
before
but
since
three
new
trails
from
the
yukon
come
together
here
from
kaltag
nulato
and
lewis
landing
and
in
the
other
directions
two
trails
branch
off
here
to
the
innoko
diggings
at
ophir
and
to
the
iditarod
a
store
or
two
and
a
couple
of
had
sprung
up
from
dishkaket
after
crossing
the
innoko
we
took
the
most
northerly
of
the
three
trails
to
the
yukon
the
lewis
a
trail
of
a
hundred
miles
that
strikes
straight
across
country
and
reaches
the
yukon
eighty
miles
farther
up
that
stream
than
the
nulato
trail
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
farther
up
than
the
kaltag
trail
the
kaltag
trail
is
the
trail
to
nome
the
nulato
trail
is
the
mail
trail
simply
because
it
suits
the
contractors
to
throw
business
to
nulato
the
lewis
is
the
direct
route
the
shortest
by
about
a
hundred
miles
but
it
was
cut
by
the
private
individual
whose
name
it
bears
and
leads
out
to
his
store
and
on
the
yukon
so
a
rival
was
built
close
by
on
the
river
and
the
prestige
and
advertisement
of
the
united
states
mail
route
thrown
to
the
trail
that
covers
one
hundred
unnecessary
miles
for
no
other
reason
than
to
deprive
lewis
of
the
legitimate
fruit
of
his
enterprise
the
character
of
the
country
changed
so
soon
as
the
innoko
was
crossed
the
wide
swamps
gave
place
to
a
broken
country
of
ridges
and
hollows
and
the
rough
laborious
trail
across
it
made
bad
travelling
buckskin
bill
with
his
cayuses
was
also
engaged
in
moving
the
meat
the
measured
miles
moreover
gave
place
to
estimated
miles
and
the
nominal
we
made
the
first
day
was
probably
not
much
more
than
twenty
sidenote
millinery
the
first
fifty
miles
of
the
country
between
the
innoko
and
the
yukon
is
much
the
same
and
we
were
climbing
and
descending
ridges
for
a
couple
of
days
then
we
crossed
a
high
ridge
and
dropped
out
of
innoko
waters
into
the
valley
of
the
yukatna
a
tributary
of
the
yukon
and
passed
down
this
valley
for
thirty
or
forty
miles
and
then
across
some
more
broken
country
to
the
yukon
at
one
of
the
a
woman
was
stopping
going
in
with
three
or
four
large
sled
loads
of
millinery
and
ladies
furnishings
we
were
told
that
the
merchandise
had
cost
her
twelve
thousand
dollars
in
fairbanks
and
that
she
expected
to
realise
thirty
thousand
dollars
by
selling
it
to
the
sporting
women
of
the
iditarod
now
a
whole
winter
debarred
from
the
latest
imported
french
fashions
this
woman
was
dressed
in
overalls
like
a
man
and
the
drivers
of
her
teams
two
white
men
and
a
native
cursed
and
swore
and
used
filthy
language
to
the
dogs
in
her
presence
it
always
angers
me
to
hear
an
indian
curse
to
hear
one
curse
in
the
presence
of
a
white
woman
was
particularly
disgusting
and
exasperating
but
what
could
one
expect
when
the
white
men
put
no
slightest
restraint
upon
themselves
and
the
woman
seemed
utterly
indifferent
i
called
the
indian
aside
and
spoke
very
plainly
to
him
and
he
ceased
his
ribaldry
but
the
white
men
still
poured
it
out
as
they
struggled
to
hitch
their
many
dogs
at
last
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
madam
i
said
to
the
woman
i
do
know
who
you
are
save
that
you
are
a
white
woman
and
as
a
white
woman
if
i
were
you
i
would
make
those
blackguards
treat
me
with
more
respect
than
to
use
such
language
before
me
she
flushed
and
made
no
reply
the
men
who
heard
what
i
said
scowled
and
made
no
reply
presently
dispositions
were
done
and
the
train
moved
off
but
i
did
not
hear
any
more
foul
language
this
is
set
down
here
chiefly
because
it
was
the
first
and
only
time
in
all
his
travels
in
alaska
that
the
writer
heard
such
language
in
such
presence

another
was
kept
by
a
man
who
had
been
cook
upon
a
recent
arctic
expedition
off
the
coast
of
alaska
and
he
gave
some
interesting
inside
information
about
an
enterprise
the
published
narrative
of
which
had
always
seemed
unsatisfactory
it
was
just
gossip
from
a
drunken
scamp
but
it
filled
several
gaps
in
the
book
as
we
approached
the
yukon
we
passed
several
meat
caches
where
great
quarters
of
beef
sewn
up
in
burlap
were
piled
on
the
side
of
the
trail
at
one
of
these
caches
the
had
been
at
work
industriously
they
had
stripped
the
burlap
from
parts
of
several
quarters
exposing
the
fat
and
had
dug
out
and
carried
it
away
little
by
little
until
it
was
all
gone
the
lean
probably
defied
their
best
efforts
at
any
rate
the
fat
offered
less
resistance
but
where
else
in
the
world
could
men
dump
quarters
of
beef
beside
the
road
and
go
off
and
leave
them
for
weeks
with
no
more
danger
of
depredation
than
the
bills
of
birds
can
effect
a
few
miles
from
the
river
the
rival
signs
began
to
appear
patronise
lewis
he
cut
this
trail
at
his
own
expense
pleaded
one
why
go
five
miles
out
of
your
way
sneered
another
across
the
wide
yukon
and
there
was
no
point
in
crossing
the
river
save
one
determination
to
lend
no
countenance
to
the
spitefulness
of
these
mail
runners
so
across
the
river
we
went
and
were
glad
to
be
on
the
yukon
again
the
next
morning
we
encountered
the
same
rival
signs
at
the
point
where
the
trail
from
lewis
joined
the
mail
trail
sidenote
treasure
island
most
of
our
travelling
was
now
upon
the
surface
of
the
yukon
and
four
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
it
stretched
ahead
of
us
ere
our
travel
should
end
at
fort
yukon
four
hours
brought
us
to
the
military
telegraph
station
at
melozi
and
we
were
able
to
send
word
ahead
that
we
were
safely
out
of
the
kuskokwim
wilderness
then
a
portage
was
crossed
and
then
the
river
pursued
again
until
with
about
thirty
miles
to
our
credit
we
made
camp
the
days
were
lengthening
out
now
the
weather
growing
mild
although
a
keen
cold
breeze
was
rarely
absent
and
travel
began
to
be
pleasant
and
camping
no
hardship
we
preferred
camping
on
several
scores
when
the
day
work
had
not
been
too
arduous
chief
amongst
them
being
that
it
gave
more
opportunity
and
privacy
for
walter
schooling
he
was
reading
aloud
and
i
was
getting
as
great
pleasure
from
renewing
as
he
from
beginning
an
acquaintance
with
that
prince
of
all
pirate
stories
kokrines
and
mouse
point
one
day
the
next
the
birches
we
passed
these
yukon
landmarks
camping
after
a
run
of
miles
some
six
miles
beyond
the
place
with
a
run
of
miles
before
us
to
tanana
i
judged
it
too
much
but
the
trail
was
greatly
improved
and
we
decided
to
attempt
it
in
one
stage
a
misreading
of
the
watch
so
that
i
roused
myself
and
walter
at
instead
of
and
did
not
realise
the
mistake
until
the
fire
was
made
and
it
was
not
worth
while
returning
to
bed
gave
us
a
fine
start
and
we
made
good
progress

so
called

because
there
is
no

there
there
is
no
other
reason

creek
old
station
were
passed
by
and
at
length
tanana
loomed
before
us
while
yet
ten
miles
away
in
just
eleven
hours
we
ran
the
miles
making
with
three
additional
miles
out
to
the
mission
altogether
by
far
the
longest
journey
of
the
winter
we
reached
tanana
on
the
of
april
just
six
weeks
since
we
left
sidenote
an
untravelled
river
we
spent
eight
days
at
tanana
including
two
sundays
passion
sunday
and
palm
sunday
but
i
was
under
an
old
promise
to
spend
easter
there
also
now
easter
fell
on
the
of
april
and
for
the
journey
to
fort
yukon
a
period
of
ten
or
twelve
days
at
the
least
would
be
necessary
that
might
easily
stretch
to
two
weeks
travelling
on
the
yukon
ice
so
late
in
april
as
this
would
involve
was
not
only
fraught
with
great
difficulty
and
discomfort
but
also
with
actual
danger
and
i
had
to
beg
to
be
absolved
of
my
promise
some
considerable
preparation
was
on
foot
for
the
festival
and
i
was
loath
to
leave
for
tanana
was
then
without
any
resident
minister
but
it
seemed
foolish
to
take
the
chances
that
would
have
to
be
taken
if
we
stayed
five
days
of
almost
ceaseless
during
our
stay
at
tanana
did
not
give
prospect
of
good
travelling
and
indeed
when
we
pulled
out
from
the
mission
on
the
monday
in
holy
week
there
was
no
sign
of
any
trail
from
tanana
up
to
fort
yukon
there
is
very
little
travel
since
the
whole
of
this
long
stretch
of
river
was
deprived
of
winter
mail
a
year
or
two
before
no
through
travel
at
all
cabins
may
usually
be
found
to
camp
in
but
there
are
no
what
travel
still
takes
place
is
local
the
journey
divided
itself
into
two
roughly
equal
parts
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
through
the
lower
ramparts
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
through
the
yukon
flats
almost
all
of
it
on
the
surface
of
the
river
it
was
hoped
to
reach
stephen
village
a
native
settlement
just
within
the
second
half
of
the
journey
for
easter
snow
does
not
lie
long
at
rest
upon
the
river
within
the
ramparts
and
particularly
within
the
narrow
stretch
of
miles
from
tanana
to
rampart
city
violent
and
almost
ceaseless
winds
sweep
the
deep
defile
in
the
mountains
through
which
the
river
winds
its
course
in
places
the
ice
is
bare
of
snow
in
places
the
snow
is
piled
in
huge
hardened
drifts
so
strong
and
so
persistent
is
this
wind
that
it
is
often
possible
to
skate
over
an
uninterrupted
black
surface
of
ice
polished
like
plate
glass
for
twenty
miles
on
a
journey
to
make
way
over
such
a
surface
against
such
wind
is
however
almost
impossible
the
dogs
get
no
footing
and
the
wind
carries
the
sled
where
it
listeth
the
journey
so
far
as
rampart
city
has
been
described
before
it
will
suffice
now
that
it
took
three
days
of
toilsome
battling
against
wind
and
bad
surface
with
nights
spent
upon
the
floor
of
grimy
cabins
so
cold
was
the
wind
that
it
is
noted
in
my
diary
with
surprise
on
the
of
april
that
i
had
worn
fur
cap
parkee
and
muffler
all
day
as
though
it
had
been
the
dead
of
winter
instead
of
three
weeks
past
the
vernal
equinox
on
wednesday
night
there
was
divine
service
at
rampart
and
on
maundy
thursday
after
four
miles
upon
the
river
we
took
the
portage
of
eleven
miles
that
cuts
a
chord
to
the
arc
of
the
greatest
bend
of
the
river
within
the
ramparts
and
so
saves
nine
miles
three
miles
more
took
us
to
the
deserted
cabin
at
the
site
of
the
abandoned
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
mike
hess
river
here
confluent
with
the
yukon
and
in
that
cabin
we
spent
the
night
having
had
the
high
bitter
wind
in
our
faces
all
day
we
hated
to
leave
the
shelter
of
the
wooded
portage
and
face
the
blast
of
the
last
three
miles
sidenote
wind
and
snow
we
woke
the
next
morning
to
a
veritable
gale
of
wind
and
snow
and
lay
in
the
cabin
till
noon
occupied
with
the
exercises
of
the
solemn
anniversary
the
wind
having
then
abated
somewhat
and
the
snow
ceased
we
sallied
forth
still
hopeful
of
making
stephen
village
for
easter
but
when
we
got
down
upon
the
river
surface
it
became
doubtful
if
we
could
proceed
and
as
we
turned
the
first
bend
we
encountered
a
fresh
gale
that
did
not
fall
short
of
a
blizzard
the
air
was
filled
with
flying
snow
that
stung
our
faces
and
blinded
us
the
dogs
muzzles
became
incrusted
with
snow
and
their
eyes
filled
with
it
so
that
it
was
hard
to
keep
them
facing
it
i
could
not
see
the
boy
at
all
when
he
was
a
hundred
feet
ahead
of
the
team
we
struggled
along
for
four
miles
and
since
it
was
then
evident
that
we
could
not
go
much
farther
without
useless
risk
we
turned
to
a
spot
on
the
bank
where
walter
knew
another
deserted
cabin
to
stand
for
he
knows
every
foot
of
this
section
of
the
river
and
once
spent
a
summer
camped
at
the
fishing
the
spot
was
reached
but
the
cabin
was
gone
the
fish
rack
still
stood
there
but
the
cabin
was
burned
down
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
return
to
the
cabin
so
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
all
my
journeyings
it
was
necessary
to
abandon
a
day
march
that
had
been
entered
upon
and
go
back
whence
we
had
come
we
ran
before
the
gale
at
great
speed
and
were
within
the
cabin
again
by
all
the
evening
and
all
night
the
storm
raged
and
i
was
in
two
minds
about
running
back
to
rampart
before
it
for
easter
since
it
was
now
out
of
the
question
to
reach
stephen
village
if
the
season
had
not
been
so
far
advanced
this
is
what
i
should
have
done
but
it
would
set
us
back
three
days
more
on
the
journey
and
on
reflection
i
was
not
willing
to
take
that
chance
with
the
so
near
so
on
the
morning
of
easter
eve
we
sallied
again
snow
falling
and
driving
heavily
and
the
wind
still
strong
but
with
yesterday
keen
edge
blunted
by
the
time
we
had
beaten
around
the
long
bend
up
which
we
had
fought
our
way
the
day
before
the
snow
had
ceased
and
by
noon
the
wind
had
dropped
and
the
sun
was
shining
and
in
a
few
moments
of
his
unobscured
strength
all
the
loose
snow
on
the
sled
was
melted
a
warning
of
the
rapidity
with
which
the
general
thaw
would
proceed
once
the
skies
were
clear
that
night
saw
us
in
the
habitable
though
dirty
deserted
cabin
at
salt
creek
so
called
one
supposes
because
the
water
of
it
is
perfectly
fresh
at
which
we
had
hoped
to
lodge
the
previous
night
sidenote
alaskan
forts
buoyed
by
the
hope
of
doing
a
double
stage
in
a
clear
windless
day
and
thus
reaching
stephen
village
for
service
at
night
we
made
a
very
early
start
that
beautiful
easter
morning
but
it
was
not
to
be
such
trail
as
there
was
ran
high
up
on
the
bank
ice
level
doubtless
when
it
was
made
much
earlier
in
the
season
but
now
at
a
slope
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
through
the
falling
of
the
water
and
seamed
with
great
cracks
such
a
trail
called
a
sidling
trail
in
the
vernacular
of
mushing
is
always
difficult
and
laborious
to
travel
for
the
sled
slips
continually
off
it
into
the
loose
snow
or
the
ice
cracks
and
often
for
long
stretches
at
a
time
one
man
must
hold
up
the
nose
of
the
sled
while
the
other
toils
at
the
in
one
place
while
thus
holding
the
front
of
the
sled
on
the
trail
walter
slipped
into
an
ugly
ice
crack
concealed
by
drifted
snow
and
so
wedged
his
foot
that
i
had
difficulty
in
extricating
him
the
last
two
bends
of
the
river
within
the
ramparts
seemed
interminable
and
it
was
with
twelve
hours
travel
behind
us
when
we
reached
old
fort
hamlin
on
the
verge
of
the
yukon
flats
these
forts
it
might
be
explained
if
one
chose
to
pursue
the
elucidation
of
alaskan
nomenclature
in
the
same
strain
are
so
called
because
they
never
had
any
defences
and
never
needed
any
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
early
days
when
the
hudson
bay
company
made
its
first
establishments
on
the
upper
river
there
was
supposed
to
be
some
need
of
fortification
and
fort
selkirk
and
fort
yukon
were
stockaded
fort
selkirk
indeed
was
sacked
and
burned
sixty
years
ago
but
not
by
yukon
indians
the
chilkats
from
the
coast
indignant
at
the
loss
of
their
profits
by
the
invasion
of
the
interior
crossed
the
mountains
descended
the
river
and
destroyed
the
post
it
thus
became
customary
to
call
a
a
fort
and
every
little
point
where
a
store
and
a
warehouse
stood
was
so
dignified
hence
fort
reliance
fort
hamlin
fort
adams
for
years
fort
hamlin
had
been
quite
deserted
but
now
smoke
issued
from
the
stovepipe
and
dogs
gave
tongue
at
our
approach
and
we
found
a
white
man
with
an
esquimau
wife
from
saint
michael
and
a
child
dwelling
there
and
carrying
a
few
goods
for
sale
with
him
we
made
our
lodging
and
with
him
and
his
family
said
our
evening
service
of
easter
and
so
to
bed
thoroughly
tired
sidenote
travelling
by
night
a
mile
beyond
fort
hamlin
the
ramparts
suddenly
cease
and
the
wide
expanse
of
the
yukon
flats
opens
at
once
ten
miles
or
so
brought
us
to
stephen
village
where
we
had
been
long
expected
and
where
a
very
busy
day
was
spent
a
number
of
indians
were
gathered
and
there
were
children
to
baptize
and
couples
to
marry
as
well
as
the
lesson
of
the
season
to
teach
it
was
a
great
disappointment
that
we
had
been
unable
to
get
here
before
and
matter
of
regret
that
being
here
at
such
labour
only
so
short
a
time
could
be
spent
but
the
closing
season
called
to
us
loudly
a
mild
warm
day
set
all
the
banks
running
with
melting
snow
and
made
the
surface
of
the
river
mushy
there
was
really
no
time
to
lose
for
the
next
miles
was
to
give
us
the
most
difficult
and
disagreeable
travelling
of
the
journey
here
in
the
flats
where
is
greatest
need
of
travel
direction
on
the
whole
river
was
no
trail
at
all
beyond
part
of
the
first
day
journey
within
the
ramparts
the
river
is
confined
in
one
channel
however
bad
the
travelling
may
be
there
is
no
danger
of
losing
the
way
but
in
the
flats
the
river
divides
into
many
wide
channels
and
these
lead
off
into
many
more
back
sloughs
with
low
timbered
banks
and
no
salient
landmarks
at
all
behind
us
were
the
bluffs
of
the
ramparts
already
growing
faint
afar
off
on
the
horizon
to
the
right
were
the
dim
shapes
of
the
beaver
mountains
all
the
rest
was
level
for
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
a
local
trail
to
a
neighbouring
took
us
some
twelve
miles
and
then
we
were
at
a
loss
the
general
direction
we
knew
and
previous
journeys
both
in
winter
and
summer
gave
us
some
notion
of
the
river
bends
to
follow
but
we
wallowed
and
floundered
until
late
at
night
before
we
reached
the
cabin
we
were
bound
for
the
snow
exceeding
soft
and
wet
for
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
time
had
plainly
come
to
change
our
day
travel
into
night
travel
for
freezing
was
resumed
each
night
after
the
sun
was
set
and
the
surface
grew
hard
again
so
at
this
cabin
we
lay
all
the
next
day
with
an
interesting
recluse
of
these
parts
who
knows
many
passages
of
shakespeare
by
heart
and
who
drew
us
a
chart
of
our
course
to
the
next
habitation
marking
every
bend
to
be
followed
and
the
place
where
the
river
must
be
crossed
but
there
is
always
difficulty
in
getting
a
new
travel
schedule
under
way
and
we
did
not
leave
until
five
in
the
morning
instead
of
at
two
as
we
had
planned
this
gave
us
insufficient
time
to
make
the
day
march
before
the
sun
softened
the
snow
and
moccasins
grew
wet
and
strings
began
to
stretch
and
the
webbing
underfoot
to
yield
and
sag
and
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
half
a
stage
by
nine
we
were
off
again
and
did
pretty
well
until
the
night
grew
so
dark
that
we
could
no
longer
distinguish
our
landmarks
then
we
went
to
the
bank
and
built
a
big
fire
and
made
a
pot
of
tea
and
sat
and
dozed
around
it
for
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
until
the
brief
darkness
of
alaskan
spring
was
overpast
and
the
dawn
began
to
give
light
enough
to
see
our
way
again
when
our
course
lay
on
the
open
river
the
snow
had
crust
enough
to
hold
us
upon
our
but
when
it
took
us
through
little
sheltered
sloughs
the
crust
was
too
thin
and
we
broke
through
all
the
time
and
that
makes
slow
painful
travel
at
last
we
came
to
a
portage
that
cuts
off
a
number
of
miles
but
the
snow
slope
by
which
the
top
of
the
bank
should
be
reached
had
a
southern
exposure
and
was
entirely
melted
and
gone
the
dogs
had
to
be
unhitched
the
sled
to
be
unloaded
the
stuff
packed
in
repeated
journeys
up
the
steep
bank
and
the
sled
hauled
up
with
a
rope
then
came
the
repacking
and
reloading
and
the
rehitching
and
when
the
portage
was
crossed
the
same
thing
had
to
be
done
to
get
down
to
the
river
bed
again
twice
more
on
that
day
the
process
was
gone
through
and
each
time
it
took
nigh
an
hour
to
get
up
the
bank
so
that
it
was
around
noon
and
the
snow
miserably
wet
and
mushy
again
when
we
reached
beaver
and
went
to
bed
at
the
only
between
fort
yukon
and
tanana
beaver
city
owes
its
existence
to
quartz
prospects
in
the
chandalar
in
which
men
of
money
and
influence
in
the
east
were
interested
the
alaska
road
commission
had
built
a
trail
some
years
before
from
the
chandalar
diggings
out
to
the
yukon
striking
the
river
at
this
point
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
another
trail
is
projected
and
swamped
out
direct
to
fairbanks
the
opening
up
of
this
route
was
expected
to
bring
much
travel
through
beaver
and
a
town
site
was
staked
and
many
cabins
built
but
chandalar
quartz
remains
an
interesting
prospect
and
the
chandalar
placers
have
not
proved
productive
and
all
but
a
few
of
the
cabins
at
beaver
city
are
unoccupied
if
the
chandalar
should
ever
make
good
beaver
city
will
be
its
river
port
sidenote
last
day
we
left
beaver
at
eleven
on
friday
night
hoping
in
two
long
runs
to
cover
the
eighty
miles
and
reach
fort
yukon
by
sunday
morning
here
was
the
first
trail
since
we
left
stephen
village
and
the
first
fairly
good
trail
since
we
left
tanana
for
there
had
been
some
recent
travel
between
fort
yukon
and
beaver
here
for
the
first
time
we
had
no
need
of
and
when
they
have
been
worn
virtually
all
the
winter
through
and
nigh
a
couple
of
thousand
miles
travelled
in
them
walking
is
strange
at
first
in
the
naked
moccasin
it
is
a
blessed
relief
however
to
be
rid
of
even
the
lightest
of
trail
we
stepped
out
gaily
into
a
beautiful
clear
night
with
a
sharp
tang
of
frost
in
the
air
and
even
the
dogs
rejoiced
in
the
knowledge
that
the
end
of
the
journey
was
at
hand
all
night
long
we
made
good
time
and
kept
it
up
without
a
stop
until
eight
in
the
morning
when
we
reached
an
inhabited
but
just
then
unoccupied
cabin
and
ate
supper
or
breakfast
as
one
chooses
to
call
it
and
went
to
bed
having
covered
fully
half
the
distance
to
fort
yukon
about
noon
we
were
rudely
awakened
by
one
of
the
usual
alaskan
accompaniments
of
approaching
summer
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
melting
the
snow
above
us
and
water
came
trickling
through
the
dirt
roof
upon
our
bed
we
moved
to
a
dry
part
of
the
cabin
and
slept
again
until
the
evening
and
at
nine
entered
upon
what
we
hoped
would
be
our
last
run
but
once
more
our
plans
to
spend
sunday
were
frustrated
the
trail
led
through
dry
sloughs
from
which
the
advancing
thaw
had
removed
the
snow
in
great
patches
sometimes
the
sled
had
to
be
hauled
over
bare
sand
sometimes
wide
detours
had
to
be
made
to
avoid
such
sand
sometimes
pools
of
open
water
covered
with
only
that
night
ice
lay
across
our
path
by
eight
in
the
morning
we
estimated
that
we
were
not
more
than
seven
or
eight
miles
from
fort
yukon
but
already
the
snow
grew
soft
and
our
feet
wet
and
the
dogs
were
very
weary
with
the
eleven
hours
mushing
it
would
take
a
long
time
and
much
toil
to
plough
through
slush
even
that
seven
or
eight
miles
so
i
gave
the
word
to
stop
and
we
made
an
camp
on
a
sunny
bank
and
after
breakfast
we
covered
our
heads
in
the
blankets
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
slept
till
five
then
we
ate
our
last
trail
meal
and
were
washed
up
and
packed
up
and
hitched
up
an
hour
and
more
before
the
snow
was
frozen
enough
for
travel
a
couple
of
hours
run
took
us
to
fort
yukon
and
so
ended
the
winter
journey
of
on
the
of
april
having
been
started
on
the
of
november
we
were
back
none
too
soon
every
day
we
should
have
found
travelling
decidedly
worse
in
a
few
more
days
the
river
would
have
begun
to
open
in
places
and
only
the
middle
would
be
safe
for
travel
with
streams
of
water
against
either
bank
and
no
way
of
getting
ashore
seventeen
days
later
the
ice
was
gone
out
and

yukon
flowing
bank

chapter
xi
the
natives
of
alaska
when
one
contemplates
the
native
people
of
the
interior
of
alaska
in
the
mass
when
with
the
stories
told
by
the
old
men
and
old
women
of
the
days
before
they
saw
the
white
man
in
mind
one
reconstructs
that
primitive
life
lacking
any
of
the
implements
the
conveniences
the
alleviations
of
civilisation
the
chief
feeling
that
arises
is
a
feeling
of
admiration
and
respect
what
a
hardy
people
they
must
have
been
how
successfully
for
untold
generations
did
they
pit
themselves
against
the
rigour
of
this
most
inhospitable
climate
with
no
tool
but
the
and
the
flint
knife
with
no
weapon
but
the
bow
and
arrow
and
spear
with
no
material
for
fish
nets
but
root
fibres
or
for
or
needles
but
bone
and
with
no
means
of
fire
making
save
two
dry
sticks
one
wonders
at
the
skill
and
patient
endurance
that
rendered
subsistence
possible
at
all
and
there
follows
quickly
upon
such
wonder
a
hot
flush
of
indignation
that
after
so
conquering
their
savage
environment
or
accommodating
themselves
to
it
that
they
not
only
held
their
own
but
increased
throughout
the
land
they
should
be
threatened
with
a
wanton
extermination
now
that
the
resources
of
civilisation
are
opened
to
them
now
that
tools
and
weapons
and
the
knowledge
of
easier
and
more
comfortable
ways
of
life
are
available
the
natives
of
the
interior
are
of
two
races
the
indian
and
the
esquimau
the
indian
inhabits
the
valley
of
the
yukon
down
to
within
three
or
four
hundred
miles
of
its
mouth
the
esquimau
occupies
the
lower
reaches
of
the
yukon
and
the
kuskokwim
and
the
whole
of
the
rivers
that
drain
into
the
arctic
ocean
west
and
north
these
inland
esquimaux
are
of
the
same
race
as
the
coast
esquimaux
and
constitute
an
interesting
people
of
whom
something
has
been
said
in
the
account
of
journeys
through
their
country
sidenote
the
athabascans
the
indians
of
the
interior
are
of
one
general
stock
the
athabascan
as
it
is
called
and
of
two
main
languages
derived
from
a
common
root
but
differing
as
much
perhaps
as
spanish
and
portuguese
the
language
of
the
upper
yukon
and
by
this
term
in
these
pages
is
meant
the
upper
american
yukon
is
almost
identical
with
the
language
of
the
lower
mackenzie
from
which
region
doubtless
these
people
came
and
with
it
have
always
maintained
intercourse
the
theory
of
the
asiatic
origin
of
the
natives
of
interior
alaska
has
always
seemed
fanciful
and
to
the
writer
the
same
translations
of
the
bible
and
the
book
of
common
prayer
serve
for
the
lower
mackenzie
and
the
upper
yukon
and
are
in
active
use
through
all
that
wide
region
despite
minor
dialectical
variations
near
the
lower
ramparts
of
the
yukon
at
stephen
village
the
language
changes
and
the
new
tongue
maintains
itself
though
with
continually
increasing
dialectical
differences
until
the
indians
overlap
the
esquimaux
six
hundred
miles
farther
down
fort
yukon
is
the
most
populous
place
on
the
river
and
the
last
place
on
the
river
where
the
upper
language
or
takhud
is
spoken
a
stretch
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
separates
it
from
the
next
native
village
and
the
inhabitants
of
that
village
are
not
intelligible
to
the
fort
yukon
indians
an
unintelligibility
which
seems
to
speak
of
long
ages
of
little
intercourse
the
history
of
the
migrations
of
the
indians
from
the
athabascan
or
mackenzie
region
is
impossible
to
trace
now
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
movement
was
by
way
of
the
porcupine
river
and
it
would
seem
that
there
must
have
been
two
distinct
migrations
one
that
passed
down
the
yukon
to
the
tanana
district
and
spread
thence
up
the
tanana
river
and
up
the
koyukuk
and
long
after
as
one
supposes
a
migration
that
peopled
the
upper
yukon
a
portion
of
this
last
migration
must
have
gone
across
country
to
the
ketchumstock
and
the
upper
tanana
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
upper
tanana
do
not
speak
the
tanana
tongue
which
is
the
tongue
of
the
middle
yukon
but
a
variant
of
the
tongue
of
the
upper
yukon
illustration
a
docile
folk
eager
for
instruction
illustration
the
mission
type
illustration
wild
and
shy
how
long
ago
these
migrations
took
place
there
is
not
the
slightest
knowledge
to
base
even
a
surmise
upon
the
natives
themselves
have
no
records
nor
even
traditions
and
the
first
point
of
contact
between
white
men
and
the
natives
of
the
interior
is
within
three
quarters
of
a
century
ago
it
may
have
been
two
or
three
families
only
which
penetrated
to
this
region
or
to
that
and
settled
there
and
what
pressure
started
them
on
their
wanderings
no
one
will
ever
know
perhaps
some
venturesome
hunter
pursuing
his
game
across
the
highlands
that
separate
the
mackenzie
from
the
yukon
was
disabled
and
compelled
to
remain
until
the
summer
and
then
discovered
the
salmon
that
made
their
way
up
the
tributaries
of
the
porcupine
the
mackenzie
has
no
salmon
or
a
local
tribal
quarrel
may
have
sent
fugitives
over
the
divide
when
first
the
white
man
came
to
the
upper
yukon
in
and
no
one
knew
that
it
was
the
same
river
at
the
mouth
of
which
the
russians
had
built
redoubt
saint
michael
ten
or
twelve
years
before
the
natives
of
the
upper
river
knew
nothing
about
the
lower
river
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
float
down
the
yukon
for
a
thousand
miles
in
a
canoe
but
an
exceedingly
difficult
matter
to
come
up
again
it
was
not
until
the
voyageurs
of
the
hudson
bay
company
in
their
adventurous
expeditions
met
at
the
mouth
of
the
tanana
river
the
agents
of
the
russian
fur
company
come
up
from
nulato
on
the
same
quest
that
the
identity
of
the
yukon
and
kwikpak
rivers
was
discovered
and
that
seems
to
have
been
well
past
the
middle
of
the
century
in
the
map
of
north
america
that
the
writer
first
used
at
school
the
yukon
flowed
north
into
the
arctic
ocean
parallel
with
the
mackenzie
sidenote
an
inoffensive
people
the
indians
of
the
interior
of
alaska
are
a
gentle
and
kindly
and
tractable
people
they
have
old
traditions
of
bloody
tribal
warfare
that
have
grown
in
ferocity
one
supposes
with
the
lapse
of
time
for
it
is
very
difficult
for
one
who
knows
them
to
believe
that
so
mild
a
race
could
ever
have
been
pugnacious
or
bloodthirsty
whether
it
were
that
the
exigencies
of
subsistence
under
arctic
conditions
demanded
almost
all
their
energies
or
that
a
realisation
of
their
constant
dependence
upon
one
another
checked
the
play
of
passion
they
differ
most
widely
and
it
seems
certain
always
differed
most
widely
in
character
from
the
indians
of
the
american
plains
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
greater
part
of
all
the
natives
of
interior
alaska
gained
by
living
amongst
them
and
travelling
from
village
to
village
during
seven
or
eight
years
furnishes
but
a
single
instance
of
an
indian
man
guilty
of
any
sort
of
violence
against
another
indian
or
against
a
white
man
except
under
the
influence
of
liquor
it
is
true
that
there
are
unquestioned
murders
that
have
been
committed
murders
of
white
men
at
that
but
in
the
sixty
years
from
the
nulato
massacre
of
over
the
whole
vast
interior
these
crimes
can
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
they
are
not
a
revengeful
people
they
do
not
cherish
the
memory
of
injuries
and
await
opportunities
of
repayment
that
trait
is
foreign
to
their
character
on
the
contrary
they
are
exceedingly
placable
and
bear
no
malice
moreover
they
are
very
submissive
even
to
the
point
of
being
imposed
upon
in
fact
they
are
decidedly
a
timid
people
in
the
matter
of
personal
encounter
in
all
these
characteristics
they
differ
from
the
north
american
indian
generally
as
he
appears
in
history
they
are
capable
of
hard
work
though
apparently
not
of
continuous
hard
work
they
will
cheerfully
support
great
privation
and
fatigue
but
when
the
immediate
necessity
is
past
they
enjoy
long
periods
of
feasting
and
leisure
having
no
property
nor
desire
of
property
save
their
clothes
their
implements
and
weapons
and
the
rude
furnishings
of
their
cabins
there
is
no
incentive
to
hard
and
continuous
work
after
all
where
is
the
high
and
peculiar
virtue
that
lies
in
the
performance
of
continuous
hard
work
why
should
any
one
labour
incessantly
this
is
the
question
the
indian
would
ask
and
one
is
not
always
sure
that
the
mills
of
massachusetts
and
the
of
pennsylvania
return
an
entirely
satisfactory
answer
as
regards
thrift
the
indian
knows
little
of
it
but
the
average
white
man
of
the
country
does
not
know
much
more
there
is
little
difference
as
regards
thrift
between
wasting
one
substance
in
a
potlatch
which
is
a
feast
for
all
comers
and
wasting
it
in
drunkenness
which
is
a
feast
for
the
liquor
sellers
save
that
one
is
barbarous
and
the
other
civilised
as
the
terms
go
it
would
seem
that
the
general
timidity
of
the
native
character
is
the
reason
for
a
very
general
untruthfulness
though
there
one
must
speak
with
qualification
and
exception
there
are
indians
whose
word
may
be
taken
as
unhesitatingly
as
the
word
of
any
white
man
and
there
are
white
men
in
the
country
whose
word
carries
no
more
assurance
than
the
word
of
any
indian
the
indian
is
prone
to
evasion
and
quibbling
rather
than
to
downright
lying
though
there
are
many
who
are
utterly
unreliable
and
untrustworthy
sidenote
sexual
morality
in
the
matter
of
sexual
morality
the
indian
standards
are
very
low
though
certainly
not
any
lower
than
the
standards
of
the
average
white
man
in
the
country
one
is
forced
to
this
constant
comparison
the
white
man
in
the
country
is
the
only
white
man
the
indian
knows
anything
about
to
the
indian
a
physical
act
is
merely
a
physical
act
all
down
his
generations
there
has
been
no
moral
connotation
therewith
and
it
is
hard
to
change
the
point
of
view
of
ages
when
it
affects
personal
indulgence
so
profoundly
the
white
man
has
been
taught
down
as
many
ages
perhaps
that
these
physical
acts
have
moral
connotation
and
are
illicit
when
divorced
therefrom
yet
he
is
as
careless
and
immoral
in
this
country
as
the
indian
is
careless
and
and
the
white
man
careless
and
immoral
conduct
is
the
chief
obstacle
which
those
who
would
engraft
upon
the
indian
the
moral
consciousness
must
contend
against
the
indian
woman
is
not
chaste
because
the
indian
man
does
not
demand
chastity
of
her
does
not
set
any
special
value
upon
her
chastity
as
such
and
the
example
of
the
chastity
which
the
white
man
demands
of
his
women
though
he
be
not
chaste
himself
is
an
example
with
which
the
native
of
alaska
has
not
come
much
into
contact
too
often
in
the
vicinity
of
mining
camps
the
white
women
who
are
most
in
evidence
are
of
another
class
sidenote
government
schools
the
indian
is
commonly
intelligent
and
teachable
and
in
most
cases
eager
to
learn
and
eager
that
his
children
may
learn
here
it
becomes
necessary
to
deal
with
a
difficult
and
somewhat
contentious
matter
that
one
would
rather
let
alone
the
government
has
undertaken
the
education
of
the
indian
and
has
set
up
a
bureau
charged
with
the
establishment
and
conduct
of
native
schools
there
are
five
such
schools
on
the
yukon
between
eagle
and
tanana
including
these
two
points
amongst
indians
all
of
whom
belong
to
the
episcopal
church
and
five
more
between
tanana
and
anvik
amongst
natives
divided
in
allegiance
between
the
episcopal
and
the
roman
catholic
churches
below
anvik
to
the
river
mouth
the
natives
are
divided
between
the
roman
and
the
greek
churches
and
they
are
outside
the
scope
of
this
book
on
the
tributaries
of
the
yukon
the
only
native
schools
are
conducted
by
the
missions
of
the
episcopal
church
on
the
koyukuk
and
tanana
rivers
and
have
no
connection
with
the
government
when
somewhat
late
in
the
day
the
government
set
its
hand
to
the
education
of
the
natives
mission
schools
had
been
conducted
for
many
years
at
the
five
stations
of
the
episcopal
church
above
tanana
and
at
the
various
mission
stations
below
that
point
the
bureau
of
education
professed
its
earnest
purpose
of
working
in
harmony
with
the
mission
authorities
and
upon
this
profession
it
secured
deeds
of
gift
for
government
school
sites
within
the
mission
reservations
from
the
bishop
of
alaska
it
can
not
be
stated
upon
a
survey
of
the
last
five
or
six
years
that
this
profession
has
been
carried
out
the
administration
of
the
bureau
of
education
has
shared
too
much
the
common
fault
of
other
departments
of
the
government
in
a
detached
and
lofty
not
to
say
supercilious
attitude
things
are
not
necessarily
right
because
a
government
bureau
orders
them
nor
are
government
officials
invested
with
superior
wisdom
merely
by
reason
of
their
connection
with
washington
it
is
just
as
important
for
a
government
school
as
for
a
mission
school
to
be
in
harmony
with
its
environment
to
adapt
itself
to
the
needs
of
the
people
it
designs
to
serve
and
that
harmony
and
adaptation
may
only
be
secured
by
a
study
of
the
situation
and
of
the
habits
and
character
the
occupations
and
resources
of
the
people
to
keep
a
school
in
session
when
the
population
of
a
village
is
gone
on
its
necessary
occasions
of
hunting
or
trapping
and
to
have
the
annual
recess
when
all
the
population
is
returned
again
is
folly
whoever
orders
it
in
accord
with
what
routine
soever
and
this
has
not
infrequently
been
done
moreover
it
is
folly
to
fail
to
recognise
that
the
apprenticeship
of
an
indian
boy
to
the
arts
by
which
he
must
make
a
living
the
arts
of
hunting
and
trapping
is
more
important
than
schooling
however
important
the
latter
may
be
and
that
any
talk
and
there
has
been
loud
talk
of
a
compulsory
education
law
which
shall
compel
such
boys
to
be
in
school
at
times
when
they
should
be
off
in
the
wilds
with
their
parents
is
worse
than
mere
folly
and
would
if
carried
out
be
a
fatal
blunder
if
such
boys
grow
up
incompetent
to
make
a
living
out
of
the
surrounding
wilderness
whence
shall
their
living
come
the
next
step
would
be
the
issuing
of
rations
and
that
would
mean
the
ultimate
degradation
and
extinction
of
the
natives
when
the
question
is
stated
in
its
baldest
terms
is
the
writer
perverse
and
barbarous
and
uncivilised
if
he
avow
his
belief
that
a
race
of
hardy
peaceful
independent
illiterates
is
of
more
value
and
worthy
of
more
respect
than
a
race
of
literate
paupers
be
it
remembered
also
that
many
of
these
illiterates
can
read
the
bible
in
their
own
tongue
and
can
make
written
communication
with
one
another
in
the
same
very
scornful
as
the
officials
of
the
bureau
have
been
about
such
attainment
one
grows
a
little
impatient
sometimes
when
a
high
official
at
washington
writes
in
response
to
a
request
for
permission
to
use
a
school
building
school
hours
for
a
class
of
instruction
in
the
native
bible
that
the
law
requires
that
all
instruction
in
the
school
be
in
the
english
language
and
that
it
is
against
the
policy
of
congress
to
use
public
money
for
religious
instruction
when
the
thermometer
drops
to
below
zero
and
stays
there
for
a
couple
of
weeks
it
is
an
expensive
matter
to
heat
a
church
for
a
bible
class
three
times
a
week
and
the
schoolhouse
is
already
cosy
and
warm
but
the
question
does
not
reduce
itself
to
the
bald
terms
referred
to
above
by
proper
advantage
of
times
and
seasons
the
indian
boy
may
have
all
the
english
education
that
will
be
of
any
service
to
him
and
may
yet
serve
his
apprenticeship
in
the
indispensable
wilderness
arts
and
given
a
kindly
and
competent
teacher
there
is
no
need
of
any
sort
of
compulsion
to
bring
indian
boys
and
girls
to
school
when
they
are
within
reach
of
it
the
indian
school
problem
is
not
an
easy
one
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
solved
by
issuing
rules
and
regulations
at
washington
but
it
can
be
solved
by
sympathetic
study
and
by
the
careful
selection
of
intelligent
cultured
teachers
after
all
this
last
is
the
most
important
requisite
too
often
it
is
assumed
that
any
one
can
teach
ignorant
youth
and
women
with
no
culture
at
all
or
with
none
beyond
the
bald
pedagogy
of
a
schoolroom
have
been
sent
to
alaska
there
have
indeed
been
notable
exceptions
there
have
been
some
very
valuable
and
capable
teachers
and
with
such
there
has
never
been
friction
at
the
missions
but
glad
the
situation
shows
signs
of
improvement
there
are
signs
of
withdrawal
from
its
detached
and
supercilious
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
bureau
signs
which
are
very
welcome
to
those
connected
with
the
missions
for
the
best
interest
of
the
native
demands
that
the
two
agencies
at
work
for
his
good
work
heartily
and
sympathetically
together
the
missions
can
do
without
the
government
did
do
without
it
for
many
years
though
glad
of
the
government
aid
in
carrying
the
burden
of
the
schools
but
the
government
can
not
do
without
the
missions
and
if
the
missions
were
forced
to
the
of
their
own
schools
there
would
be
empty
benches
in
the
schools
of
the
government
sidenote
the
threat
of
extinction
that
the
indian
race
of
interior
alaska
is
threatened
with
extinction
there
is
unhappily
little
room
to
doubt
and
that
the
threat
may
be
averted
is
the
hope
and
labour
of
the
missionaries
amongst
them
at
most
places
where
vital
statistics
are
kept
the
exceeds
the
though
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult
to
secure
accurate
statistics
and
to
be
sure
that
they
always
cover
the
same
ground
the
natives
wander
within
certain
territorial
limits
they
wander
widely
whenever
a
child
is
born
it
is
certain
that
if
it
lives
long
enough
it
will
be
brought
to
a
mission
to
be
baptized
but
a
death
often
occurs
at
some
isolated
camp
that
is
not
reported
till
long
after
and
may
escape
registration
altogether
certain
diseases
that
have
played
havoc
in
the
past
are
not
much
feared
now
for
the
last
seven
years
supplies
of
the
diphtheritic
antitoxin
have
been
kept
at
all
the
missions
of
the
episcopal
church
and
in
the
summer
of
when
there
was
an
outbreak
of
smallpox
at
porcupine
river
almost
every
indian
of
interior
alaska
was
vaccinated
mainly
by
the
mission
staffs
diphtheria
has
been
a
dreadful
scourge
the
valley
of
the
upper
kuskokwim
was
almost
depopulated
by
it
in
a
disease
resembling
measles
took
half
the
population
of
the
lower
yukon
villages
in
in
the
last
few
years
there
have
been
no
serious
epidemics
but
epidemic
disease
does
not
constitute
the
chief
danger
that
threatens
the
native
sidenote
dwelling
and
clothing
that
chief
danger
looms
from
two
things
tuberculosis
and
whisky
whether
tuberculosis
is
a
disease
indigenous
to
these
parts
or
whether
it
was
introduced
with
the
white
man
has
been
disputed
and
would
be
difficult
of
determination
probably
it
was
always
present
amongst
the
natives
the
old
ones
declare
that
it
was
but
the
changed
conditions
of
their
lives
have
certainly
much
aggravated
it
they
lived
much
more
in
the
open
when
they
had
no
tool
but
a
and
did
not
build
cabins
the
winter
residence
in
those
days
was
it
is
true
a
dark
hut
covered
with
earth
and
poles
but
the
time
of

usually
sells

from
the

at

the

there
is
no
country
in

where
it
is
more

for

usually
at
about
the

for

the

has
done
his

the

has
most
of
his

back
again
the

that
an
indian
has
caught
a
black
fox
the
most
exciting
item
of

that
ever
flies
around
a
native

does
not
give
any
great

to
one
who
is
acquainted
with

conditions
because
he
knows
that
it
will
bring
little

there
will
be
keen
competition

there

abundant

that
the

amongst

developed
by
the

at
nominal
prices

for
fish

a
little

this
naturally
does
not

sometimes
at

itself
to
all

the

in

can
combine
the

it
a
man
who
was
removed

retained
the
and
no
one
could
be
found
to
accept
the
vacant
judgeship
in

precinct
the
commissioner
was
moving
all
those
whom
he
thought
had
influence
to
get
him
appointed
deputy
marshal
instead
of
commissioner
because
the
deputy
marshal
gets
a
salary
of
two
thousand

and

which
was
more
than
the

yielded

reminded
of
some
topsyturvyism
when

in

sounds
like
the

compelled
to
wink
at

quickly

a

a

shift
the

in

indeed
a
certain
restless
belief
in
the
superior

of
some
other

is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
prospector
the
tide
of
white
men
that
has
flowed
into
an

neighbourhood
gradually
ebbs
away
and
leaves
the
indian
behind
with
new

with
new
desires
with
new
diseases
with
new
vices
and
with
a
varied
assortment
of
illegitimate
children
to
support
the
indian
remains
usually
in
diminished
numbers
with
impaired
character
with
lowered
physique
with
the
of
the
white

blackguardism
as
his
chief
acquirement
in
english
but
he
remains
it
is
unquestionable
that
the
best
natives
in
the
country
are
those
that
have
had
the
least
intimacy
with
the
white
man
and
it
follows
that
the
most
hopeful
and
promising
mission
stations
are
those
far
up
the
tributary
streams
away
from
mining

and
off
the

never

at

only
of
those
who
seek
them
with

trouble
at
such
stations
the
improvement
of
the
indian
is
manifest
and
the
population
increases
by
reason
of
their
remoteness
they
are
very
expensive
to
equip
and
maintain
but
they
are
well
worth
while
one
such
has
been
described
on
the
koyukuk
another
at
this
writing
is
establishing
with
equal
promise
at
the
tanana
crossing
one
of
the
most
difficult
points
to
reach
in
all
interior
alaska
this
chapter
must
not
close
without
a
few
words
about
the
native
children
dirty
of
course
they
almost
always
are
children
in
a
state
of
nature
will
always
be
dirty
and
even
those
farthest
removed
from
that
state
show
a
marked
tendency
to
revert
to
it
but
when
one
has
become
sufficiently
used
to
their
dirt
to
be
able
to
ignore
it
they
are
very
attractive
intolerance
of
dirt
is
largely
an
acquired
habit
anyway
in
view
of
their
indulgent
rearing
for
indian
parents
are
perhaps
the
most
indulgent
in
the
world
they
are
singularly
docile
they
have
an
affectionate
disposition
and
are
quick
and
eager
to
learn
many
of
them
are
very
pretty
with
a
soft
beauty
of
complexion
and
a
delicate
moulding
of
feature
that
are
lost
as
they
grow
older
it
takes
some
time
to
overcome
their
shyness
and
win
their
confidence
but
when
friendly
relations
have
been
established
one
grows
very
fond
of
them
foregathering
with
them
again
is
distinctly
something
to
look
forward
to
upon
the
return
to
a
mission
and
to
see
them
come
running
to
have
them
press
around
thrusting
their
little
hands
into
one
own
or
hanging
to
one
coat
is
a
delight
that
compensates
for
much
disappointment
with
the
grown
ups
in
the
midst
of
such
a
crowd
of
healthy
vivacious
youngsters
and
eager
one
positively
refuses
to
be
hopeless
about
the
race
chapter
xii
photography
in
the
arctic
there
is
no
country
in
which
an
anastigmatic
lens
is
of
more
use
to
the
photographer
than
alaska
and
every
camera
with
which
it
is
hoped
to
take
winter
scenes
should
have
this
equipment
during
two
or
three
months
in
the
year
it
makes
the
difference
in
practice
between
getting
photographs
and
getting
none
in
theory
one
may
always
set
up
a
tripod
and
increase
length
of
exposure
as
light
diminishes
but
the
most
interesting
scenes
the
most
attractive
effects
often
present
themselves
under
the
severest
conditions
of
weather
and
he
must
be
an
enthusiast
indeed
who
will
get
his
tripod
from
the
sled
pull
out
its
telescoped
tubes
set
it
up
and
adjust
it
for
a
picture
with
the
thermometer
at
or
below
zero
and
when
he
is
done
he
is
very
likely
to
be
a
frozen
enthusiast
with
an
anastigmatic
lens
working
at
say
and
with
a
speed
film
glass
plates
are
utterly
out
of
the
question
on
the
trail
it
is
possible
to
make
a
at
one
of
a
second
on
a
clear
day
around
noon
even
in
the
dead
of
winter
in
any
part
of
alaska
that
the
writer
has
travelled
in
there
are
those
who
write
that
they
can
always
hold
a
camera
still
enough
to
get
a
sharp
negative
at
even
one
tenth
of
a
second
probably
the
personal
equation
counts
largely
in
such
a
matter
and
a
man
of
very
decided
phlegmatic
temperament
may
have
advantage
over
his
more
sanguine
and
nervous
brother
the
thing
may
be
done
the
writer
has
done
it
himself
but
the
point
is
it
can
not
be
depended
on
at
this
speed
three
out
of
four
of
his
exposures
will
be
blurred
whereas
at
one
of
a
second
a
sharp
clear
negative
may
always
be
secured
it
may
be
admitted
at
once
that
at
extremely
low
temperatures
the
working
of
any
shutter
becomes
doubtful
and
most
of
them
go
out
of
any
reliable
action
altogether
after
trying
and
failing
completely
with
three
or
four
of
the
more
expensive
makes
of
shutters
the
writer
has
for
the
last
few
years
used
a
volute
with
general
satisfaction
though
in
the
great
cold
even
that
shutter
from
which
all
trace
of
grease
or
oil
was
carefully
removed
by
the
makers
is
somewhat
slowed
up
so
that
a
rare
exposure
at
or
below
zero
would
be
made
at
an
indicated
speed
of
one
fiftieth
rather
than
at
one
taking
the
chance
of
an
rather
than
a
blurred
negative
to
wish
for
a
shutter
of
absolute
correctness
and
of
absolute
dependability
under
all
circumstances
arranged
for
exposures
of
one
fifteenth
and
one
twentieth
as
well
as
one
tenth
and
one
is
probably
to
wish
for
the
unobtainable
sidenote
care
of
films
and
cameras
the
care
of
the
camera
and
the
films
exposed
and
unexposed
the
winter
through
when
travelling
on
the
alaskan
trail
is
a
very
important
and
very
simple
matter
though
not
generally
learned
until
many
negatives
have
been
spoiled
and
sometimes
lenses
injured
it
may
be
summed
up
in
one
general
rule
keep
instrument
and
films
always
outdoors
one
unfamiliar
with
arctic
conditions
would
not
suppose
that
much
trouble
would
be
caused
by
that
of
all
photographic
preparations
and
apparatus
damp
in
a
country
where
the
thermometer
rarely
goes
above
freezing
the
winter
through
and
that
is
a
just
conclusion
provided
such
things
be
kept
in
the
natural
temperature
outdoors
but
consider
the
great
range
of
temperature
when
the
thermometer
stands
at
outdoors
and
say
indoors
here
is
a
difference
of
anything
wooden
or
metallic
especially
anything
metallic
brought
into
the
house
immediately
condenses
the
moisture
with
which
the
warm
interior
atmosphere
is
laden
and
becomes
in
a
few
moments
covered
with
frost
gradually
as
the
article
assumes
the
temperature
of
the
room
the
frost
melts
the
water
is
absorbed
and
the
damage
is
done
as
surely
as
though
it
had
been
soused
in
a
bucket
if
it
be
necessary
to
take
camera
and
films
indoors
for
an
interior
view
which
one
does
somewhat
reluctantly
the
films
must
be
taken
at
once
to
the
stove
and
the
camera
only
very
gradually
leaving
the
latter
on
the
floor
the
coldest
part
of
the
room
for
a
while
and
shifting
its
position
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
frost
it
has
accumulated
begins
to
melt
whereupon
it
should
be
placed
close
to
the
heat
that
the
water
may
evaporate
as
fast
as
it
forms
outdoors
camera
and
films
alike
are
perfectly
safe
however
intense
the
cold
indeed
films
keep
almost
indefinitely
in
the
cold
and
do
not
deteriorate
at
all
one
learns
by
and
by
to
have
all
films
sent
sealed
up
in
tin
cans
to
put
them
back
and
seal
them
up
again
when
despite
the
maker
instructions
not
to
do
so
the
maker
knows
the
rules
but
the
user
learns
the
exceptions
when
films
are
thus
protected
they
may
be
taken
indoors
or
left
out
indifferently
as
no
moist
air
can
get
to
them
the
rule
given
is
one
that
all
men
in
this
country
follow
with
firearms
they
are
always
left
outdoors
and
no
iron
will
rust
outdoors
in
the
winter
unless
a
man
intend
to
take
his
gun
to
pieces
and
clean
it
thoroughly
he
never
brings
it
in
the
house
the
writer
has
on
several
occasions
removed
an
exposed
film
and
inserted
a
new
one
outdoors
using
the
loaded
sled
for
a
table
at
below
zero
taking
the
chance
of
freezing
his
fingers
rather
than
of
ruining
the
film
it
is
an
interesting
exercise
in
dexterity
of
manipulation
everything
that
can
be
done
with
the
mittened
hand
is
done
the
material
is
placed
within
easy
reach
then
off
with
the
mittens
and
gloves
and
make
the
change
as
quickly
as
may
be
there
is
just
one
brief
season
in
the
year
when
high
speeds
of
shutters
may
be
used
in
the
month
of
april
when
a
new
flurry
of
snow
has
put
a
mantle
of
dazzling
whiteness
upon
the
earth
and
the
sun
mounts
comparatively
high
in
the
heavens
under
such
circumstances
there
is
almost
if
not
quite
tropical
illumination
here
is
a
picture
of
native
football
at
the
allakaket
just
north
of
the
arctic
circle
made
late
in
april
with
a
graflex
fitted
with
a
lens
working
at
at
the
full
speed
of
its
shutter
one
of
a
second
in
five
years
use
that
was
the
only
time
when
that
speed
was
used
or
any
speed
above
one
commonly
even
in
summer
many
more
exposures
are
made
with
it
at
one
fiftieth
than
at
one
for
this
is
not
a
brightly
lit
country
in
summer
and
nearly
all
visitors
and
tourists
find
their
negatives
much
the
graflex
though
unapproached
in
its
own
sphere
is
not
a
good
camera
despite
confident
assertions
to
the
contrary
it
is
too
bulky
to
carry
at
all
in
the
winter
and
its
mechanism
is
apt
to
refuse
duty
in
the
cold
the
graflex
can
not
be
turned
to
make
a
perpendicular
photograph
but
must
always
be
used
with
the
greatest
dimension
horizontal
except
in
brilliant
sunshine
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
sharp
focus
and
even
though
the
focus
appear
sharp
on
the
ground
glass
the
negative
may
prove
blurred
then
the
instrument
is
a
great
dust
catcher
and
seems
to
have
been
constructed
with
a
perverse
ingenuity
so
as
to
make
it
as
difficult
as
possible
to
clean
the
writer
uses
his
graflex
almost
solely
for
native
portraits
and
studies
for
which
purpose
it
is
admirable
and
has
enabled
him
to
secure
negatives
that
he
could
not
have
obtained
with
any
other
hand
camera
even
in
the
summer
however
he
always
carries
his
folding
pocket
kodak
as
well
and
uses
it
instead
of
the
graflex
for
landscapes
and
large
groups
if
he
had
to
choose
between
the
two
instruments
and
confine
himself
to
one
he
would
unhesitatingly
choose
the
folding
pocket
kodak
the
difficulties
of
winter
photography
in
alaska
do
not
end
with
the
making
of
the
exposure
all
water
must
be
brought
up
in
a
bucket
from
a
in
the
river
and
though
it
be
clear
water
when
it
is
dipped
up
from
under
the
ice
it
is
chiefly
ice
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
house
during
any
cold
spell
one
learns
to
be
very
economical
of
water
when
it
is
procured
with
such
difficulty
learns
to
dry
prints
with
between
the
successive
washings
which
is
the
best
way
of
washing
with
the
minimum
of
water
is
decidedly
cheaper
than
water
under
some
circumstances
while
the
rivers
run
perfectly
clear
and
bright
under
the
ice
in
the
winter
in
summer
the
turbid
water
of
nearly
all
our
large
streams
introduces
another
difficulty
and
photographic
operation
must
sometimes
be
deferred
for
weeks
unless
the
rain
barrels
be
full
or
enough
ice
be
found
in
the
over
and
above
the
domestic
needs
to
serve
sidenote
effect
of
cold
on
emulsions
it
seems
certain
that
the
speed
of
the
sensitive
emulsions
with
which
the
films
are
covered
is
reduced
in
very
cold
weather
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
was
so
the
following
experiments
were
resorted
to
the
camera
was
brought
out
of
the
house
half
an
hour
before
noon
at
below
zero
and
an
exposure
made
immediately
then
the
camera
was
left
in
position
for
an
hour
and
another
exposure
made
there
was
little
difference
in
the
strength
of
the
negatives
and
what
difference
there
was
seemed
in
favour
of
the
second
exposure
evidently
if
the
emulsion
had
slowed
the
shutter
had
slowed
also
so
opportunity
was
awaited
to
make
a
more
decisive
test
when
there
remained
but
one
exposure
on
a
roll
of
film
the
camera
was
set
outdoors
at
a
temperature
of
below
zero
and
left
for
an
hour
then
an
exposure
was
made
and
the
film
wound
up
and
withdrawn
while
a
new
film
just
brought
from
the
house
was
as
quickly
as
possible
inserted
in
its
place
and
a
second
exposure
made
the
latter
was
appreciably
stronger
even
this
test
is
of
course
not
entirely
conclusive
one
would
have
to
be
quite
sure
that
the
emulsions
were
identical
but
it
confirms
the
writer
impression
that
extreme
cold
slows
the
film
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
the
manufacturers
to
settle
this
point
beyond
question
in
a
modern
laboratory
and
it
is
certainly
worth
doing
there
is
much
sameness
about
winter
scenes
in
alaska
as
the
reader
has
doubtless
already
remarked
yet
the
sameness
is
more
due
to
a
lack
of
alertness
in
the
photographer
than
to
an
absence
of
variety
if
the
traveller
had
nothing
to
think
about
but
his
camera
if
all
other
considerations
could
be
subordinated
to
the
securing
of
negatives
then
here
as
elsewhere
the
average
merit
of
pictures
would
be
greater
sometimes
the
most
interesting
scenes
occur
in
the
midst
of
stress
of
difficult
travel
when
there
is
opportunity
for
no
more
than
a
fleeting
recognition
of
their
pictorial
interest
tight
places
often
make
attractive
pictures
but
most
commonly
do
not
get
made
into
pictures
at
all
the
study
of
the
aspects
of
nature
is
likely
to
languish
amidst
the
severe
weather
of
the
northern
winter
and
the

yet
there

the

to

the
fear
of
the
camera
or
the
dislike
of
the
camera
that
used
to
affect
the
native
mind
is
gone
now
save
perhaps
in
certain
remote
quarters
and
these
interesting
people
are
generally
quite
willing
to
stand
still
and
be
snapped

ask
for

upon

there
is
clamorous

a
famous
french
physician
said
that
his
dread
of
the
world
to
come
lay
in
his
expectation
that
the
souls
he
met
would
reproach
him
for
not
having
cured
a
certain
obstinate
malady
that
he
had
much
repute
in
dealing
with
so
the
travelling
amateur
in
photography
sometimes
feels
his
conscience
heavy
under
a
load
of
promised
pictures
that
he
has
forgotten
or
has
been
unable
to
make
he
feels
that
his
native
friends
whom
he
shall
meet
in
the
world
to
come
will
assuredly
greet
him
with
my
picture
the
burden
increases
all
the
time
and
the
indian
never
forgets
it
avails
nothing
even
to
explain
that
the
exposure
was
a
failure
a
picture
was
promised
no
picture
has
been
given
that
is
as
far
as
the
native
gets
and
the
making
of
extra
prints
in
the
cases
where
it
is
possible
to
make
them
is
itself
quite
a
tax
upon
time
and
material
just
as
it
is
true
that
to
be
well
informed
on
any
subject
a
man
must
read
a
great
deal
and
be
content
not
to
have
use
for
a
great
deal
that
he
reads
so
to
secure
good
photographs
of
spots
and
scenes
of
note
as
he
travels
he
must
make
many
negatives
and
be
content
to
destroy
many
the
records
of
a
second
visit
in
better
weather
or
at
a
more
favourable
season
will
supersede
an
earlier
typical
groups
more
casual
ones
the
standard
that
he
exacts
of
himself
rises
and
work
he
was
content
with
contents
him
no
more
sometimes
one
is
tempted
to
think
that
the
main
difference
between
an
unsuccessful
and
a
successful
amateur
photographer
is
that
the
former
hoards
all
his
negatives
while
the
latter
relentlessly
burns
those
which
do
not
come
up
to
the
mark
if
not
at
once
yet
assuredly
by
and
by
so
the
surprise
that
one
feels
at
many
of
the
illustrations
in
modern
books
of
arctic
travel
is
not
that
the
travellers
made
such
poor
photographs
but
that
they
kept
them
and
used
them
for
there
can
be
no
question
that
poor
photographs
are
worse
than
none
at
all

the
northern
lights
the
northern
lights
are
a
very
common
phenomenon
of
interior
alaska
much
more
common
than
in
the
very
high
latitudes
around
the
north
pole
for
it
has
been
pretty
well
determined
that
there
is
an
auroral
pole
just
as
there
is
a
magnetic
pole
and
a
pole
of
cold
none
of
which
coincides
with
the
geographical
pole
itself
all
the
arctic
explorers
seem
agreed
that
north
of
the
parallel
these
appearances
are
less
in
frequency
and
brilliance
than
in
the
regions
ten
or
fifteen
degrees
farther
south
it
may
be
said
roundly
that
it
is
a
rare
thing
in
winter
for
a
still
clear
night
when
there
is
not
much
moon
to
pass
without
some
auroral
display
in
the
interior
of
alaska
as
long
as
we
have
any
night
at
all
in
the
early
summer
and
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
have
night
again
late
in
the
summer
they
may
be
seen
so
that
one
gains
the
impression
that
the
phenomenon
occurs
the
year
round
and
is
merely
rendered
invisible
by
the
perpetual
daylight
of
midsummer
sidenote
a
general
aurora
the
alaskan
auroras
seem
to
divide
themselves
into
two
great
classes
those
that
occupy
the
whole
heavens
on
a
grand
scale
and
appear
to
be
at
a
great
distance
above
the
earth
and
those
that
are
smaller
and
seem
much
closer
inasmuch
as
a
letter
written
from
fort
yukon
to
a
town
in
massachusetts
describing
one
of
the
former
class
brought
a
reply
that
on
the
same
night
a
brilliant
aurora
was
observed
there
also
it
would
seem
that
auroras
on
the
grand
scale
are
visible
over
a
large
part
of
the
earth
surface
at
once
whereas
the
lesser
manifestations
though
sometimes
of
great
brilliance
and
beauty
give
one
the
impression
of
being
local
one
gets
unfortunately
so
accustomed
to
this
light
in
the
sky
in
alaska
that
it
becomes
a
matter
of
course
and
is
little
noticed
unless
it
be
extraordinarily
vivid
again
often
very
splendid
displays
occur
in
the
intensely
cold
weather
when
no
matter
how
warmly
one
may
be
clad
it
is
impossible
to
stand
still
long
outdoors
and
outdoors
an
observer
must
be
to
follow
the
constant
movement
that
accompanies
the
aurora
moreover
there
is
something
very
tantalising
in
the
observing
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
what
moment
an
ordinary
waving
auroral
streamer
that
stretches
its
greenish
milky
light
across
the
sky
beautiful
yet
commonplace
may
burst
forth
into
a
display
of
the
first
magnitude
or
if
it
will
do
so
at
all
the
winter
traveller
has
the
best
chance
for
observing
this
phenomenon
because
much
of
his
travel
is
done
before
daylight
and
often
much
more
than
he
desires
or
deserves
is
done
after
daylight
while
if
his
journeys
be
protracted
so
long
as
snow
and
ice
serve
for
passage
at
all
towards
spring
he
will
travel
entirely
at
night
instead
of
by
day
it
is
intended
in
this
chapter
merely
to
attempt
a
description
of
a
few
of
the
more
striking
auroral
displays
that
the
writer
has
seen
the
accounts
being
transcribed
from
journals
written
within
a
few
hours
at
most
from
the
time
of
occurrence
and
in
the
first
case
written
so
soon
as
he
went
indoors
this
was
on
the
of
october
at
fairbanks
a
little
removed
from
the
town
itself
when
first
the
heavens
were
noticed
there
was
one
clear
bow
of
milky
light
stretching
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
horizon
reflected
in
the
broken
surface
of
the
river
and
glistening
on
the
ice
cakes
that
swirled
down
with
the
swift
current
then
the
southern
end
of
the
bow
began
to
twist
on
itself
until
it
had
produced
a
queer
elongated
corkscrew
appearance
up
to
the
zenith
while
the
northern
end
spread
out
and
bellied
from
east
to
west
then
the
whole
display
moved
rapidly
across
the
sky
until
it
lay
low
and
faint
on
the
western
horizon
and
it
seemed
to
be
all
over
but
before
one
could
turn
to
go
indoors
a
new
point
of
light
appeared
suddenly
high
up
in
the
sky
and
burst
like
a
pyrotechnic
bomb
into
a
thousand
globules
with
a
molten
centre
flung
far
out
to
north
and
south
then
began
one
of
the
most
beautiful
celestial
exhibitions
that
the
writer
has
ever
seen
these
globules
stretched
into
ribbon
streamers
dividing
and
subdividing
until
the
whole
sky
was
filled
with
them
and
these
ribbon
streamers
of
greenish
opalescent
light
curved
constantly
inward
and
outward
upon
themselves
with
a
quick
jerking
movement
like
the
cracking
of
a
whip
and
every
time
the
ribbons
curved
their
lower
edges
frayed
out
and
the
fringe
was
prismatic
the
pinks
and
mauves
flashed
as
the
ribbon
curved
and
frayed
and
were
gone
there
was
no
other
colour
in
the
whole
heavens
save
the
milky
light
but
every
time
the
streamers
thrashed
back
and
forth
their
under
edges
fringed
into
the
glowing
tints
of
presently
the
whole
display
faded
out
until
it
was
gone
but
as
we
turned
again
to
seek
the
warmth
of
the
house
all
at
once
tiny
fingers
of
light
appeared
all
over
the
upper
sky
like
the
flashing
of
spicules
of
alum
under
a
microscope
when
a
solution
has
dried
to
the
point
of
crystallisation
and
stretched
up
and
down
lengthening
and
lengthening
to
the
horizon
and
gathering
themselves
together
at
the
zenith
into
a
crown
three
times
this
was
repeated
each
time
the
light
faded
gradually
but
completely
from
the
sky
and
flashed
out
again
instantaneously
for
a
full
hour
until
it
was
impossible
to
stand
gazing
any
longer
for
the
cold
the
fascinating
display
was
watched
and
how
much
longer
it
continued
can
not
be
said
it
was
a
grand
general
aurora
high
in
the
heavens
not
vividly
coloured
save
for
the
prismatic
fringes
but
of
brilliant
illumination
and
remarkable
amongst
all
the
auroras
observed
since
for
its
sudden
changes
and
startling
climaxes
draped
auroras
are
common
in
this
country
though
it
has
been
wrongly
stated
that
they
are
only
seen
near
open
seas
but
their
undulations
are
generally
more
deliberate
and
their
character
maintained
this
one
flashed
on
and
off
and
changed
its
nature
as
though
some
finger
were
pressing
buttons
that
controlled
the
electrical
discharges
of
the
universe
yet
it
was
noticed
that
even
in
its
brightest
moments
the
light
of
the
stars
could
be
seen
through
it
sidenote
a
local
aurora
the
next
aurora
to
be
described
was
of
a
totally
different
kind
it
occurred
on
the
of
march
the
writer
with
an
indian
attendant
was
travelling
on
the
koyukuk
river
from
coldfoot
to
bettles
and
owing
to
a
heavy
drifted
trail
night
had
fallen
while
yet
the
was
far
away
there
was
no
moon
and
the
trail
was
wholly
indistinguishable
from
the
surrounding
snow
yet
to
keep
on
the
trail
was
the
only
chance
of
going
forward
at
all
for
whenever
the
toboggan
slid
off
into
the
deep
soft
snow
it
came
to
a
standstill
and
had
to
be
dragged
laboriously
back
again
a
good
leader
would
have
kept
the
trail
but
we
had
none
such
amongst
our
dogs
that
year
thus
slowly
we
went
along
in
the
dark
continually
missing
the
trail
on
this
side
and
on
that
we
did
not
know
on
which
bank
of
the
river
the
was
situated
for
it
was
our
first
journey
in
those
parts
we
only
knew
the
trail
would
take
us
there
could
we
follow
it
all
at
once
a
light
burst
forth
seemingly
not
a
hundred
yards
above
our
heads
that
lit
up
that
trail
like
a
and
threw
our
shadows
black
upon
the
snow
there
was
nothing
faint
and
fluorescent
about
that
aurora
it
burned
and
gleamed
like
magnesium
wire
and
by
its
light
we
were
able
to
see
our
path
distinctly
and
to
make
good
time
along
it
until
in
a
mile
or
two
we
were
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
the
candle
shining
in
the
window
of
the
and
were
safe
for
the
night
now
one
does
not
really
know
that
this
was
an
aurora
at
all
save
that
there
was
nothing
else
it
could
have
been
it
was
a
phenomenon
altogether
apart
from
the
one
first
described
not
occupying
the
vault
of
heaven
streaming
from
horizon
to
zenith
not
remote
and
majestic
there
was
really
little
opportunity
to
observe
it
at
all
one
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
trail
it
illumined
anxious
not
to
set
foot
to
the
right
or
left
save
for
an
occasional
glance
upward
we
saw
only
its
reflected
light
upon
the
white
expanse
beneath
it
was
simply
a
streak
of
light
right
above
our
heads
holding
steadily
in
position
though
fluctuating
a
little
in
strength
a
light
to
light
us
home
that
is
what
it
was
to
us
and
it
was
the
most
surprising
and
opportune
example
of
what
has
been
referred
to
here
as
the
aurora
that
eight
winters
have
afforded
the
most
opportune
but
not
the
most
beautiful
the
next
to
be
described
though
of
the
local
order
was
the
most
striking
and
beautiful
manifestation
of
the
northern
lights
the
writer
has
ever
seen
it
was
that
rare
and
lovely
thing
a
coloured
aurora
all
of
one
rich
deep
tint
sidenote
a
red
aurora
it
was
on
the
of
march
on
the
chandalar
river
a
day
march
above
the
gap
by
which
that
stream
enters
the
yukon
flats
and
five
days
north
of
fort
yukon
a
new
strike
had
been
made
on
the
chandalar
and
a
new
town
caro
established
abandoned
since
all
day
long
we
had
been
troubled
and
hindered
by
overflow
water
on
the
ice
saturating
the
snow
an
unpleasant
feature
for
which
this
stream
is
noted
and
when
night
fell
and
we
thought
we
ought
to
be
approaching
the
town
it
seemed
yet
unaccountably
far
off
at
last
in
the
darkness
we
came
to
a
creek
that
we
decided
must
surely
be
flat
creek
near
the
mouth
of
which
the
new
settlement
stood
and
at
the
same
time
we
came
to
overflow
water
so
deep
that
it
covered
both
ice
and
snow
and
looked
dangerous
so
the
dogs
were
halted
while
the
indian
boy
went
ahead
cautiously
to
see
if
the
town
were
not
just
around
the
bend
and
the
writer
sat
down
tired
on
the
sled
while
sitting
there
all
at
once
from
the
top
of
the
mountainous
bluff
that
marked
the
mouth
of
the
creek
a
clear
red
light
sprang
up
and
spread
out
across
the
sky
dyeing
the
snow
and
gleaming
in
the
water
lighting
up
all
the
river
valley
from
mountain
to
mountain
with
a
most
beautiful
carmine
of
the
utmost
intensity
and
depth
in
wave
after
wave
it
came
growing
brighter
and
brighter
as
though
some
gigantic
hand
on
that
mountain
top
were
flinging
out
the
liquid
radiance
into
the
night
there
was
no
suggestion
of
any
other
colour
it
was
all
pure
carmine
and
it
seemed
to
accumulate
in
until
all
the
landscape
was
bathed
in
its
effulgence
and
then
it
gradually
died
away
the
native
boy
was
gone
just
half
an
hour
it
began
about
five
minutes
after
he
left
and
ended
about
five
minutes
before
he
returned
so
that
its
whole
duration
was
twenty
minutes
there
had
been
no
aurora
at
all
before
there
was
nothing
after
for
his
quest
had
been
fruitless
and
since
we
would
not
venture
that
water
in
the
dark
we
made
our
camp
on
the
bank
and
were
thus
two
hours
or
more
yet
in
the
open
the
boy
had
stopped
to
look
at
it
himself
long
time
as
he
said
and
declared
it
was
the
only
red
aurora
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
twenty
odd
years
life
it
was
a
very
rare
and
beautiful
sight
and
it
was
hard
to
resist
that
impression
of
a
gigantic
hand
flinging
liquid
red
fire
from
the
mountain
top
into
the
sky
its
source
seemed
no
higher
than
the
mountain
top
seemed
to
be
the
mountain
top
itself
and
its
extent
seemed
confined
within
the
river
valley
sidenote
a
grand
general
display
there
is
only
one
other
that
shall
be
described
although
there
are
many
mentioned
with
more
or
less
particularity
in
the
diaries
of
these
travels
and
this
last
one
is
of
the
character
of
the
first
and
not
at
all
of
the
second
and
third
for
it
was
on
the
grand
scale
filling
all
the
heavens
a
phenomenon
one
is
convinced
of
an
order
distinct
and
different
from
the
local
kind
there
was
exceptionally
good
opportunity
for
observing
this
display
since
it
occurred
during
an
journey
the
night
of
the
of
april
with
brilliant
starlight
but
no
moon
while
we
were
hastening
to
reach
eagle
for
easter
we
had
made
a
new
traverse
from
the
tanana
to
the
yukon
through
two
hundred
miles
of
uninhabited
country
and
had
missed
the
head
of
the
creek
that
would
have
taken
us
to
the
latter
river
in
thirty
miles
dropping
into
one
that
meandered
for
upward
of
a
hundred
before
it
discharged
into
the
great
river
it
was
one
on
good
friday
morning
when
we
reached
a
on
the
yukon
eighty
miles
from
eagle
the
only
chance
to
keep
the
appointment
was
to
travel
all
the
two
remaining
nights
so
we
cached
almost
all
our
load
at
the
for
we
should
retrace
our
steps
when
eagle
was
visited
and
thus
were
able
to
travel
fast
both
nights
were
marked
by
fine
auroral
displays
so
extensive
and
of
such
apparent
height
as
to
give
the
impression
that
they
must
be
visible
over
large
areas
of
the
earth
both
continued
all
night
long
and
were
of
the
same
general
description
but
the
second
night
display
was
emphasised
in
its
main
features
and
elaborated
in
its
detail
and
was
the
more
striking
and
notable
and
worthy
of
description
it
began
by
an
exquisite
and
delicate
weaving
of
fine
fluorescent
filaments
of
light
in
and
out
among
the
stars
until
at
times
a
perfect
network
was
formed
like
lace
amidst
diamonds
first
in
one
quarter
of
the
heavens
then
in
another
then
stretching
and
weaving
its
web
right
across
the
sky
the
yukon
runs
roughly
north
and
south
in
these
reaches
and
the
general
trend
of
the
whole
display
was
parallel
with
the
course
for
an
hour
or
more
the
ceaseless
extension
and
looping
of
these
infinitely
elastic
threads
of
light
went
on
with
constant
variation
in
their
brilliance
but
no
change
in
their
form
and
never
an
cessation
of
motion

muk
a
pure
malamute
then
the
familiar
feature
of
the
draped
aurora
was
introduced
always
a
beautiful
sight
to
watch
slowly
and
most
gracefully
issued
out
of
the
north
band
after
band
band
after
band
of
fire
each
curling
and
recurling
on
itself
like
the
ribbon
that
carries
the
motto
under
a
shield
of
arms
and
each
continually
fraying
out
its
lower
edge
into
subdued
rainbow
tints
then
these
bands
never
for
a
moment
still
were
gathered
up
together
to
the
zenith
till
from
almost
all
round
the
horizon
vibrant
meridians
of
light
stretched
up
to
a
crown
of
glory
almost
but
not
quite
directly
overhead
so
bright
that
all
the
waving
bands
that
now
assumed
more
the
appearance
of
its
rays
paled
before
it
then
the
crown
began
to
revolve
and
as
it
revolved
with
constantly
increasing
speed
it
gathered
all
its
rays
into
one
gigantic
spiral
that
travelled
as
it
spun
towards
the
east
until
all
form
was
dissipated
in
a
nebulous
mist
that
withdrew
behind
the
mountains
and
glowered
there
like
a
dawn
and
left
the
skies
void
of
all
light
save
the
stars
it
was
a
fine
instance
of
the
stupendous
sportiveness
of
the
aurora
that
sometimes
seems
to
have
no
more
law
or
rule
than
the
gambolling
of
a
kitten
and
to
build
up
splendid
and
majestic
effects
merely
to
whelm
them
all
in
wantonness
a
moment
later
a
particularly
fine
and
striking
phase
of
an
aurora
is
very
likely
to
be
followed
by
some
such
sudden
whimsical
destruction
it
was
as
though
that
light
hidden
behind
the
mountains
were
mocking
us
then
from
out
the
north
again
appeared
one
clear
belt
of
light
that
stretched
rapidly
and
steadily
all
across
the
heavens
until
it
formed
an
arch
that
stood
there
stationary
and
from
that
motionless
arch
the
only
motionless
manifestation
that
whole
night
there
came
a
gradual
superb
crescendo
of
light
that
lit
the
wide
white
river
basin
from
mountain
top
to
mountain
top
and
threw
the
shadows
of
the
dogs
and
the
sled
sharper
and
blacker
upon
the
snow
and
in
the
very
moment
of
its
climax
was
gone
again
utterly
while
yet
the
exclamations
of
wonder
were
on
our
lips
it
was
as
though
piqued
at
our
admiration
the
aurora
had
wiped
itself
out
and
often
and
often
there
is
precisely
that
impression
of
wilfulness
about
it
all
night
long
the
splendour
kept
up
and
all
night
long
as
the
dogs
went
at
a
good
clip
and
one
of
us
rode
while
the
other
was
at
the
sled
we
gazed
and
marvelled
at
its
infinite
variety
at
its
astonishing
fertility
of
effect
at
its
whimsical
vagaries
until
the
true
dawn
of
easter
swallowed
up
the
beauty
of
the
night
as
we
came
in
sight
of
eagle
and
we
wondered
with
what
more
lavish
advertisement
the
dawn
of
the
first
easter
was
heralded
into
the
waste
places
of
the
snow
sidenote
sound
and
smell
there
are
men
in
alaska
whose
statements
demand
every
respect
who
claim
to
have
heard
frequently
and
unmistakably
a
swishing
sound
accompanying
the
movements
of
the
aurora
and
there
are
some
who
claim
to
have
detected
an
odour
accompanying
it
without
venturing
any
opinion
on
the
subject
in
general
the
writer
would
simply
say
that
though
he
thinks
he
possesses
as
good
ears
and
as
good
a
nose
as
most
people
he
has
never
heard
any
sound
or
smelled
any
odour
that
he
believed
to
come
from
the
northern
lights
indeed
he
has
often
felt
that
with
all
the
energy
and
with
all
the
rapid
movement
of
the
aurora
it
was
mysterious
that
there
should
be
absolutely
no
sound
the
aurora
often
looks
as
if
it
to
swish
but
to
his
ears
it
has
never
done
it
so
much
phosphorescent
light
might
naturally
be
accompanied
by
some
chemical
odour
but
to
his
nostrils
never
has
been
queer
uncertain
noises
in
the
silence
of
an
arctic
night
there
often
are
noises
of
crackling
twigs
perhaps
noises
of
settling
snow
noises
in
the
ice
itself
but
they
are
to
be
heard
when
there
is
no
aurora
as
well
as
when
there
is
it
is
rare
to
stand
on
the
banks
of
the
yukon
on
a
cold
night
and
not
hear
some
faint
crepitating
sounds
sometimes
running
back
and
forth
across
the
frozen
river
sometimes
resembling
the
ring
of
distant
skates
without
offering
any
pronouncement
upon
what
is
a
very
interesting
question
it
seems
to
the
writer
possible
that
to
an
ear
intently
listening
some
such
noise
coinciding
with
a
decided
movement
of
a
great
auroral
streamer
might
seem
to
be
caused
by
the
movement

there
are
two
breeds
of
native
dogs
in
alaska
and
a
third
that
is
usually
spoken
of
as
such
the
malamute
is
the
esquimau
dog
and
what
for
want
of
a
better
name
is
called
the
siwash
is
the
indian
dog
many
years
ago
the
hudson
bay
voyageurs
bred
some
selected
strains
of
imported
dog
with
the
indian
dogs
of
those
parts
or
else
did
no
more
than
carefully
select
the
best
individuals
of
the
native
species
and
bred
from
them
exclusively
it
is
variously
stated
and
that
is
the
accepted
origin
of
the

and
the

dog
teams
though
with
setters
and
pointers
hounds
of
various
sorts
mastiffs
saint
bernards

has
resulted
in
a
general
admixture
of
breeds
so
that
the
work
dogs
of
alaska
are
an
heterogeneous
lot
it
should
also
be
stated
that
the
terms
malamute
and
husky
are
very
generally
confused
and
often
used
interchangeably
the
malamute
the
alaskan
esquimau
dog
is
precisely
the
same
dog
as
that
found
amongst
the
natives
of
baffin

and

they
are

was
never
animal

the
malamute
dog
his
coat
while
it
is
not
fluffy
nor
the
hair
long
is
yet
so
dense
and
heavy
that
it
affords
him
a
perfect
protection
against
the
utmost
severity
of
cold
his
feet
are
tough
and
clean
and
do
not
readily
accumulate
snow
between
the
toes
and
therefore
do
not
easily
get
sore
which
is
the
great
drawback
of
nearly
all
outside
dogs
and
their
mixed
progeny
he
is
hardy
and
thrifty
and
does
well
on
less
food
than
the
mixed
breeds
and
despite
peary
to
the
contrary
he
will
eat
anything
he
will
not
eat
anything
but
meat
says
peary
i
have
tried
and
i
know
no
dog
accustomed
to
a
flesh
diet
willingly
leaves
it
for
other
food
the

is
a
carnivorous
animal
but
hunger
will
whet
his
appetite
for
anything
that
his

can
digest

the
counterpart
of
peary

malamute
has
thriven
for
years
on
his
daily
ration
of
dried
fish
tallow
and
rice
and
eats
biscuits
and
doughnuts
whenever
he
can
get
them
the
malamute
is
affectionate
and
faithful
and
likes
to
be
made
a
pet
of
but
he
is
very
jealous
and
an
incorrigible
fighter
he
has
little
of
the
fawning
submissiveness
of
pet
dogs
outside
but
is
independent
and
and
apt
to
make
a
troublesome
pet
however
pets
that
give
little
trouble
seldom
give
much
pleasure
his
comparative
shortness
of
leg
makes
him
somewhat
better
adapted
to
the
hard
crusted
snow
of
the
coast
than
to
the
soft
snow
of
the
interior
but
he
is
a
ceaseless
and
tireless
worker
who
loves
to
pull
his
prick
ears
always
erect
his
bushy
graceful
tail
carried
high
unless
it
curl
upon
the
back
as
is
the
case
with
some
his
compact
coat
of
his
sharp
muzzle
and
black
nose
and
quick
narrow
eyes
give
him
an
air
of
keenness
and
alertness
that
marks
him
out
amongst
dogs
when
he
is
in
good
condition
and
his
coat
is
taken
care
of
he
is
a
handsome
fellow
and
he
will
weigh
from
to
or
ninety
pounds
the
husky
is
a
long
rangy
dog
with
more
body
and
longer
legs
than
the
malamute
and
with
a
shorter
coat
the
coat
is
very
thick
and
dense
however
and
furnishes
a
sufficient
protection
a
good
spirited
husky
will
carry
his
tail
erect
like
a
malamute
but
the
ears
are
not
permanently
pricked
up
they
are
mobile
he
is
perhaps
the
general
preference
amongst
dog
drivers
in
the
interior
but
he
has
not
the
graceful
distinction
of
appearance
of
the
malamute
the
siwash
dog
is
the
common
indian
dog
generally
undersized
uncared
for
half
starved
most
of
the
time
and
snappish
because
not
handled
save
with
roughness
in
general
appearance
he
resembles
somewhat
a
small
malamute
though
indeed
nowadays
so
mixed
have
breeds
become
that
he
may
be
any
cur
or
mongrel
he
is
a
wonderful
little
worker
and
the
loads
he
will
pull
are
astonishing
sometimes
with
it
all
he
is
an
fellow
especially
when
there
has
been
a
good
moose
or
caribou
killing
and
he
has
gorged
upon
the
refuse
and
put
some
flesh
upon
his
bones
and
if
one
will
take
a
little
trouble
to
make
friends
with
him
he
likes
petting
as
much
as
any
dog
most
indian
dogs
sabe
white
man
and
will
snap
at
one
first
advances
on
the
whole
it
is
far
better
to
let
them
alone
for
encouraged
at
all
they
are
terrible
thieves
what
hungry
creatures
are
not
and
make
all
sorts
of
trouble
with
one
own
team
the
pure
malamute
and
the
pure
husky
do
not
bark
at
all
they
howl
barking
is
a
sure
sign
of
an
admixture
of
other
strains
sidenote
dog
breeding
here
it
may
be
worth
while
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
general
belief
that
dogs
in
alaska
are
interbred
with
wolves
that
the
dog
and
the
wolf
have
a
common
origin
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
that
they
will
interbreed
is
equally
sure
but
diligent
inquiry
on
the
part
of
the
writer
for
a
number
of
years
throughout
all
interior
alaska
amongst
whites
and
natives
has
failed
to
educe
one
authentic
instance
of
intentional
interbreeding
has
failed
to
discover
one
man
who
knows
of
his
own
knowledge
that
any
living
dog
is
the
offspring
of
such
union
while
therefore
it
is
not
here
stated
that
such
has
not
taken
place
or
even
that
it
does
not
take
place
yet
the
author
is
satisfied
that
it
is
a
very
rare
thing
indeed
and
that
the
common
stories
of
dogs
that
are
half
wolf
are
fabulous
indeed
it
seems
a
rare
thing
when
any
sort
of
pains
is
taken
about
the
breeding
of
dogs
in
a
country
where
dogs
are
so
important
where
they
are
indispensable
for
any
sort
of
travel
during
six
or
seven
months
in
the
year
over
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
it
one
would
expect
that
much
attention
would
be
paid
to
dog
breeding
but
this
is
not
the
case
here
and
there
a
man
who
takes
pride
in
a
team
will
carefully
mate
the
best
available
couple
and
carefully
rear
their
offspring
but
for
the
most
part
breeding
seems
left
to
chance
a
team
all
of
malamutes
or
all
of
huskies
a
matched
team
of
any
sort
is
the
exception
and
excites
interest
and
remark
the
market
for
dogs
is
so
uncertain
that
it
is
doubtful
if
there
would
be
any
money
in
scientific
breeding
for
the
trail
when
a
stampede
to
new
diggings
takes
place
the
price
of
dogs
rises
enormously
any
sort
of
good
dog
on
the
spot
may
be
worth
a
hundred
dollars
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
man
with
a
kennel
would
make
a
small
fortune
out
of
hand
but
at
other
times
it
is
hard
to
get
dollars
for
the
best
of
dogs
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
a
dog
team
is
considerable
when
the
went
all
down
the
yukon
and
dogs
were
used
exclusively
the
contracting
company
estimated
that
it
cost
dollars
per
head
per
annum
to
feed
its
dogs
while
to
the
traveller
in
remote
regions
buying
dog
feed
in
small
parcels
here
and
there
the
cost
is
not
less
than
one
hundred
dollars
per
head
of
course
a
man
engaged
in
dog
raising
would
have
his
own
on
the
yukon
and
would
catch
almost
all
that
his
dogs
would
eat
fish
is
plentiful
in
alaska
it
is
transportation
that
costs
dogs
not
working
can
do
very
well
on
straight
dried
fish
but
for
the
working
dog
this
ration
is
supplemented
by
rice
and
tallow
or
other
cereal
and
fat
not
only
because
the
animal
does
better
on
it
but
also
because
straight
dried
fish
is
a
very
bulky
food
and
weight
for
weight
goes
not
nearly
so
far
cooking
for
the
dogs
is
troublesome
but
economical
of
weight
and
bulk
and
conserves
the
vigour
of
the
team
in
the
the
dogs
are
still
an
expense
they
must
be
boarded
at
some
fish
camp
at
a
cost
of
about
five
dollars
per
head
per
month
the
white
man
found
the
dog
team
in
use
amongst
the
natives
all
over
the
interior
but
he
taught
the
indian
how
to
drive
dogs
the
natives
had
never
evolved
a
leader
some
fleet
stripling
always
ran
ahead
and
the
dogs
followed
the
leader
guided
by
the
voice
geeing
and
hawing
stopping
and
advancing
at
the
word
of
command
is
a
white
innovation
though
now
universally
adopted
by
the
natives
so
is
the
dog
collar
the
siwash
harness
is
simply
a
band
that
goes
round
the
shoulders
and
over
the
breast
in
the
interior
the
universal
siwash
hitch
was
tandem
and
is
yet
but
as
trails
have
widened
and
improved
more
and
more
the
tendency
grows
amongst
white
men
to
hitch
two
abreast
and
the
most
convenient
rig
is
a
lead
line
to
which
each
dog
is
attached
independently
by
a
either
two
abreast
or
by
adding
a
further
length
to
the
lead
line
one
behind
the
other
so
that
on
a
narrow
trail
the
tandem
rig
may
be
quickly
resorted
to
sidenote
the
docking
of
tails
one
advantage
of
the
change
from
single
to
double
rig
is
the
decay
of
the
cruel
custom
of
bobbing
the
dogs
tails
when
dogs
are
hitched
one
close
behind
the
other
and
the
closer
the
better
for
pulling
the
tail
of
the
dog
in
front
becomes
heavy
with
ice
from
the
condensation
of
the
breath
of
the
dog
behind
until
not
only
is
he
carrying
weight
but
the
use
of
the
tail
for
warmth
at
night
is
foregone
so
it
was
the
universal
practice
to
cut
tails
short
off
but
sleeping
out
in
the
open
as
travelling
dogs
often
must
do
in
all
sorts
of
weather
with
the
thermometer
at
or
below
zero
sometimes
a
thick
bushy
tail
is
a
great
protection
to
a
dog
with
it
he
covers
nose
and
feet
and
is
tucked
up
snug
and
warm
it
is
the
dog
natural
protection
for
the
muzzle
and
the
thinly
haired
extremities
a
few
years
ago
almost
all
work
dogs
in
the
interior
were
bobtailed
now
the
plumes
wave
over
the
teams
again
five
dogs
are
usually
considered
the
minimum
team
and
seven
dogs
make
a
good
team
a
good
load
for
a
dog
team
is
fifty
pounds
to
the
dog
on
ordinary
trails
the
dogs
will
pull
as
much
as
one
hundred
pounds
apiece
or
more
but
that
becomes
more
like
freighting
than
travelling
on
a
good
level
trail
with
strong
big
dogs
men
sometimes
haul
two
hundred
pounds
to
the
dog
these
however
are
propositions
in
the
slang
of
the
trail
and
the
man
is
doing
hard
work
with
a
band
around
his
chest
and
the
pole
in
his
hand
for
quick
travelling
fifty
pounds
to
the
dog
is
enough
the
most
useful
outside
strains
that
the
white
man
has
introduced
into
the
dogs
of
the
interior
are
the
pointer
and
setter
and
collie
the
themselves
make
very
fast
teams
and
soon
adapt
themselves
to
the
climate
but
their
feet
will
not
stand
the
strain
the
intelligence
would
make
him
a
most
admirable
leader
did
he
not
have
so
pronouncedly
the
faults
of
his
good
qualities
he
wants
to
do
all
the
work
he
works
himself
to
death
it
is
the
leader
business
to
keep
the
team
strung
out
it
is
not
his
business
to
pull
the
load
but
the
admixture
of
these
strains
with
the
native
blood
has
produced
some
very
fine
dogs
the
newfoundland
and
saint
bernard
strains
have
been
perhaps
the
least
successful
admixtures
they
are
too
heavy
and
cumbersome
and
always
have
tender
feet
their
bodies
and
the
bodies
of
their
mongrel
progeny
are
too
heavy
for
their
feet
sidenote
dog
loyalty
the
last
statement
with
regard
to
newfoundland
and
saint
bernard
dogs
has
an
interesting
exception
there
is
a
dog
not
uncommon
in
alaska
that
by
a
curious
inversion
of
phrase
is
known
as
the
what
is
meant
is
the
dog
the
dog
that
belongs
to
the
man
that
uses
only
one
dog
many
and
many
a
prospector
pulls
his
whole
winter
a
hundred
miles
or
more
into
the
hills
with
the
aid
of
one
dog
his
progress
is
slow
in
bad
places
or
on
up
grades
he
must
relay
and
all
the
time
he
is
doing
more
work
than
the
dog
is
but
he
manages
to
get
his
stuff
to
his
cabin
or
his
camp
with
no
other
aid
than
one
dog
can
give
it

usually

being

of
one
of
the
breeds
mentioned
or
of
its
predominant
strain
the
companionship
between
such
a
man
and
such
a
dog
is
very
close
and
the
understanding
complete
sometimes
the
dog
will
be
his
master
sole
society
for
the
whole
winter
indeed
any
man
of
feeling
who
spends
the
winters
with
a
dog
team
must
grow
to
a
deep
sympathy
with
the
animals
and
to
a
keen
sometimes
almost
a
poignant
sense
of
what
he
owes
to
them
there
is
a
mystery
about
domestic
animals
of
whatever
kind
it
is
a
mystery
that
man
should
be
able
to
impose
his
will
upon
them
change
their
habits
and
characters
constrain
them
to
his
tasks
take
up
all
their
lives
with
unnatural
toil
and
that
he
should
get
affection
and
devotion
in
return
makes
the
mystery
yet
more
mysterious
the
dog
gets
his
food
often
of
poor
quality
and
scant
quantity
and
that
is
all
he
gets
yet
the
life
of
a
work
dog
that
has
a
kind
and
considerate
master
is
not
an
unhappy
one
the
dog
is
as
full
of
the
canine
joy
of
life
as
though
he
had
never
worn
a
collar
and
not
only
sports
and
gambols
when
free
but
really
seems
to
like
his
work
and
do
it
gladly
he
will
chafe
at
inaction
he
will
come
eagerly
to
the
harness
in
the
morning
often
will
come
before
he
is
called
and
ask
to
be
harnessed
and
if
for
any
reason
lameness
or
galled
neck
or
sore
feet
a
dog
is
cut
out
of
the
team
temporarily
to
run
loose
he
will
try
at
every
chance
to
get
back
into
his
place
and
will
often
attack
the
dog
that
seems
to
him
to
be
occupying
it
while
a
dog
left
behind
will
howl
most
piteously
and
make
desperate
efforts
to
break
his
chain
and
rejoin
his
companions
and
his
labour
and
the
wonderful
and
pitiful
thing
about
it
is
that
no
sort
of
severity
or
brutality
on
his
part
will
destroy
that
zealous
allegiance
the
dog
in
alaska
is
absolutely
dependent
upon
man
for
subsistence
and
he
seems
to
realise
it
there
is
a
great
deal
of
cruelty
and
brutality
amongst
dog
drivers
in
alaska
at
times
it
is
true
most
dogs
need
some
punishment
dogs
differ
as
much
as
men
do
and
some
are
lazy
and
some
are
the
best
of
them
will
develop
bad
trail
habits
if
they
are
allowed
to
habits
which
will
prove
hard
to
break
by
and
by
and
be
a
continual
source
of
delay
and
annoyance
until
broken
but
a
very
slight
punishment
judicially
administered
at
the
moment
will
usually
suffice
just
as
well
as
a
severe
one
and
the
main
source
of
brutality
in
the
punishment
of
dogs
is
sheer
bad
temper
on
the
part
of
the
driver
and
has
for
its
only
possible
end
not
the
correction
of
the
animal
fault
but
the
satisfaction
of
its
owner
rage
to
see
some
hulking
passionate
brute
lashing
a
poor
little
dog
with
a
chain
or
beating
him
with
a
club
to
see
dogs
overworked
to
utter
exhaustion
and
their
lagging
steps
still
hastened
by
a
rain
of
blows
these
are
the
sickening
sights
of
the
trail
and
they
are
not
uncommon
the
language
of
most
dog
drivers
to
their
dogs
consists
of
a
mixture
of
cursing
and
ribaldry
excused
by
the
statement
that
only
by
the
use
of
such
speech
may
dogs
be
driven
at
all
but
there
is
little
point
in
the
excuse
such
speech
is
to
an
extent
not
far
from
universal
the
speech
of
the
country
swedes
who
have
little
and
indians
who
have
none
other
english
will
yet
be
volubly
profane
and
obscene
in
the
latter
case
often
with
complete
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
the
terms
yet
it
must
be
recorded
not
ungratefully
by
the
impartial
observer
that
the
rare
presence
of
a
decent
woman
or
a
clergyman
will
almost
always
put
a
check
upon
blackguardly
speech
even
that
of
a
dog
driver
women
and
clergymen
being
supposed
the
only
two
classes
who
could
have
any
possible
objection
to
foulness
of
mouth
to
refer
continually
to
the
excrements
of
the
body
to
sexual
commerce
natural
and
unnatural
all
in
the
grossest
terms
and
to
mix
these
matters
intimately
with
the
sacred
names
is
manly
speech
amongst
a
large
part
of

as

it
has
been
claimed
with
justice
that
the
introduction

into

has
been
highly
successful
yet
there
is
much
misconception
amongst

the

of
that
success
stimulated
by
the

of
the

the

gives

to

as

eliminate

scourge
of

the

to
announce
such
a
hope
based
upon

in

is
to
announce
misconception
of
the

as
similarity

warrant
us
in
expecting
similar
results
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
the

will
never
eliminate
the

before
discussing
the
success
of
the
reindeer
experiment
and
its
lack
of
any
bearing
upon
the
number
or
the
usefulness
of
the

the
writer
would
pause
to
take
strong
exception
to
the
description
of
the
husky
dog
as
the
scourge
of
labrador
and
would
insist
that
any
such
wholesale
condemnation
is
a
boomerang
that
returns
upon
the
head
of
the
labradorian
who
uses
it
for
as
the
dog
is
one
of
the
most
adaptable
of
all
domestic
animals
and
is
to
an
amazing
extent
what
his
master
makes
him
to
bring
a
railing
accusation
against
the
whole
race
of
dogs
is
in
reality
to
accuse
those
who
breed
and
rear
them
why
should
the
dog
have
richly
earned
the
gratitude
and
affection
of
all
the

should
he
be

and

the

made

his
claim
upon

it
is
he
and
his

have

up

so
far
as

without

the

would
suddenly
cease

the
question
that
is
often
asked
outside
as
to
whether
the

dog
is
not
a
savage
beast
it
is
justly
replied
not
unless
he
happens
to
belong
to
a
savage
beast
is
it
really
otherwise
anywhere
instead
of
the
reindeer
eliminating
the

there
is
far
greater
likelihood
of
the

eliminating
the

and
the
professed
dog
lover
indignant
at
the
opprobrious
term
applied
to
a
whole
race
of

may
be
disposed
to
echo
lady
macbeth
wish
may
good
digestion
wait
on
appetite
so
far
as
substituting
another
draught
animal
for
the
dog
is
concerned
if
the
whole
equine
tribe
even
down
to
manchurian
ponies
should
for
some
strange
reason
be
out
of
the
question
the
canadian
government
had
better
import
the
polar
ox
or
the
yak
it
is
only
amongst
a
nomadic
people
whose
main
quest
is
pasturage
that
the
reindeer
is
a
satisfactory
draught
animal
when
introduced
into
alaska
there
was
doubtless
expectation
that
he
would
be
generally
useful
in
this
capacity
for
a
while
certain
on
the
seward
peninsula
were
served
by
him
and
here
and
there
a
deluded
prospector
put
his
on
a
reindeer
sled
it
is
safe
to
say
that
no
reindeer
are
so
employed
they
were
soon
abandoned
on
the
mail
trails
and
the
prospector
after
one
season
experience
slaughtered
his
reindeer
and
traded
its
meat
and
hide
for
a
couple
of
dogs
consider
that
the
reindeer
feeds
upon
one
thing
alone
the
moss
that
is
named
after
him
and
that
while
this
moss
is
very
widely
distributed
indeed
throughout
alaska
it
is
not
found
at
all
in
the
river
valleys
or
the
forests
but
only
upon
the
treeless
hills
at
considerable
elevation
now
the
rivers
are
the
highways
it
is
on
their
frozen
surface
or
on
portage
trails
through
the
woods
that
the
greater
part
of
all
travelling
is
done
and
in
particular
that
established
routes
of
regular
communication
are
maintained
to
leave
the
trail
after
a
journey
to
wander
miles
into
the
hills
to
herd
the
deer
while
they
browse
from
slope
to
slope
digging
the
snow
away
in
search
of
their
provender
is
wholly
incompatible
with
any
sustained
or
regular
travel
the
reindeer
is
a
timid
and
almost
defenceless
creature
wolves
and
lynxes
prey
upon
him
one
lynx
is
thought
to
have
killed
upward
of
twenty
head
in
one
season
out
of
the
herd
that
was
stationed
at
tanana
leaping
upon
the
backs
of
the
creatures
cutting
their
throats
sucking
their
blood
and
riding
them
until
they
dropped
and
died
a
few
dogs
will
soon
work
havoc
in
a
herd
so
the
reindeer
must
be
constantly
protected
and
at
the
same
time
must
have
range
over
a
considerable
scope
of
country
the
care
of
reindeer
is
a
business
in
itself

incredulous

sidenote
the
reindeer
usefulness
speaking
broadly
the
reindeer
is
a
stupid
unwieldy
and
intractable
brute
not
comparing
for
a
moment
with
the
dog
in
intelligence
or
adaptability
the
common
notion
that
his
name
is
derived
from
the
use
of
reins
in
driving
him
thus
putting
him
in
the
class
with
the
horse
is
a
mistake
the
word
comes
from
a
norse
root
which
refers
to
his
habit
the
rein
with
which
he
is
driven
is
a
rope
tied
around
one
of
his
horns
he
has
no
cognisance
of
gee
and
haw
nor
of
any
other
vocal
direction
but
must
be
yanked
hither
and
thither
with
the
rope
by
main
force
while
to
stop
him
in
his
mad
career
once
he
is
started
it
is
often
necessary
to
throw
him
with
the
rope
in
lapland
there
are
doubtless
individual
deer
better
trained
the
lap
herders
tell
of
them
with
pride
but
in
the
main
this
is
a
just
description
of
reindeer
handling
all
the
chief
herders
in
alaska
are
laps
brought
over
for
their
knowledge
of
the
animals
and
the
writer
has
repeatedly
ridden
behind
some
of
their
best
deer
wherein
then
lies
the
success
of
the
reindeer
experiment
in
alaska
chiefly
in
the
provision
of
a
regular
meat
supply
by
which
the
natives
and
whites
in
the
vicinity
of
a
herd
are
relieved
from
the
precariousness
of
the
chase
or
the
rapacity
of
the
butcher
company
the
esquimau
having
served
his
allotted
apprenticeship
of
five
years
and
entered
upon
possession
of
a
herd
can
at
any
time
kill
and
dress
a
kid
of
the
flock
for
his
family
or
for
the
market
the
price
of
butcher
meat
has
been
kept
down
all
over
the
seward
peninsula
by
the
competition
of
the
numerous
reindeer
herds
to
the
comfort
of
the
population
and
the
exasperation
of
the
butcher
company
and
many
an
esquimau
has
become
passably
rich
the
skin
of
the
animal
also
furnishes
a
warm
and
material
for
clothing
and
finds
a
ready
sale
at
a
good
price
this
success
is
however
confined
so
far
to
the
coast
the
herds
have
not
thriven
in
the
interior
and
have
now
all
been
withdrawn
to
the
coast
beasts
of
prey
killed
them
a
hoof
disease
destroyed
many
others
are
supposed
to
have
died
from
eating
some
poisonous
fungus
in
five
or
six
years
the
herd
at
tanana
had
not
increased
at
all
but
rather
diminished
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
other
herds
on
the
yukon
the
indian
moreover
does
not
take
to
herding
as
the
esquimau
does
and
can
hardly
be
induced
to
the
segregation
of
himself
and
his
family
from
his
tribe
which
reindeer
herding
involves
the
apprentices
on
the
yukon
were
nearly
all
of
them
esquimaux
from
the
coast
it
may
be
that
the
salt
of
the
coast
region
is
essential
to
the
of
the
reindeer
it
is
not
so
with
the
caribou
and
the
reindeer
is
nothing
but
a
domesticated
caribou
many
herds
of
which
in
the
interior
of
alaska
never
visit
the
coast
at
all
but
all
caribou
herds
have
their
and
one
wishes
that
the
plan
of
furnishing
salt
for
the
herds
in
the
interior
had
been
adopted
by
the
government
for
a
season
before
their
removal
was
determined
upon
like
most
other
resources
of
alaska

imported

first
decried
and
ridiculed
has
now
become
the
slender
foundation
for
extravagant
speculations
of
prosperity
the
millions
of
acres
waiting
for
the
plough
in
the
interior
have
lately
been
supplemented
in
this
visionary
treasury
by
the
capitalisation
of
the
vast
tundras
of
the
coast
the
golden
of
the
one
finding
counterpart
in
the
multitudinous
herds
of
the
other
the
growing
dearth
of
in
the
united
states
offers
it
seems
to
alaska
the
opportunity
of
supplying
the
american
market
with
meat
and
the
kindling
fancy
of
the
enthusiastic
booster
sees
trains
loaded
with
frozen
reindeer
meat
rolling
into
chicago
while
the
reindeer
will
never
supersede
the
dog
as
a
draught
animal
anywhere
the
horse
is
rapidly
superseding
him
on
good
trails
in
the
more
settled
and
peopled
regions
in
the
fairbanks
and
nome
districts
in
the
circle
and
koyukuk
districts
in
the
fortymile
and
in
the
iditarod
in
all
districts
where
any
extensive
mining
is
carried
on
heavy
freights
are
moved
by
horses
and
this
tendency
will
doubtless
increase
rather
than
diminish
the
dog
team
can
not
compete
with
the
horse
team
when
it
comes
to
moving
heavy
loads
over
good
trails
the
grain
that
the
horse
eats
is
imported
and
in
the
main
will
probably
always
be
imported
but
oats
cut
green
and
properly
cared
for
make
excellent
fodder
and
the
native
hay
while
not
nearly
as
nutritious
as
the
imported
timothy
will
sufficiently
supplement
grain
we
hear
a
great
deal
nowadays
of
the
benefits
which
are
to
come
to
alaska
from
the
railroad
which
the
united
states
is
expected
to
build
from
to
the
yukon
and
the
clamorous
voices
of
the
journalist
and
the
professional
promoter
and
politician
which
seem
the
only
voices
which
ever
reach
the
ear
of
government
are
insistent
that
this
is
the
one
great
thing
that
will
bring
prosperity
to
the
country
yet
the
writer
is
confident
that
he
expresses
almost
the
unanimous
opinion
of
those
who
live
in
the
country
outside
of
the
classes
mentioned
when
he
says
that
if
the
amount
of
money
which
this
railroad
will
cost
were
expended
upon
good
highways
and
trails
the
benefit
would
be
much
greater
it
is
means
of
intercommunication
between
the
various
parts
of
the
country
that
is
the
great
need
of
alaska
some
of
its
most
promising
sections
are
almost
inaccessible
now
or
accessible
only
at
great
trouble
and
expense
access
to
the
country
itself
for
the
introduction
of
merchandise
is
furnished
easily
enough
during
three
or
four
months
of
the
year
by
its
incomparable
system
of
waterways
good
highways
well
engineered
and
well
maintained
over
which
horse
teams
could
be
used
summer
and
winter
would
remove
much
of
what
at
present
is
the
almost
prohibitive
cost
of
distributing
that
merchandise
from
river
points
such
roads
would
give
an
enormous
stimulus
to
prospecting
and
would
render
it
possible
to
work
gold
placers
all
over
the
country
that
are
of
too
low
grade
to
be
worked
at
the
present
rates
of
transportation
a
good
highway
from
valdez
to
fairbanks
and
the
making
of
the
begun
road
a
good
highway
from
fairbanks
to
the
upper
tanana
as
far
as
the
nabesna
connecting
with
the
one
from
the
copper
river
country
and
the
coast
another
from
the
yukon
into
the
koyukuk
and
the
chandalar
another
from
fairbanks
into
the
kantishna
connecting
with
one
from
the
lower
kuskokwim
and
one
from
the
iditarod
a
road
from
eagle
across
the
almost
unknown
region
save
for
the
line
of
the
meridian
between
the
yukon
and
the
porcupine
rivers
two
or
three
roads
between
the
yukon
and
the
tanana
a
road
from
the
koyukuk
to
kotzebue
sound
these
would
constitute
main
arteries
of
travel
and
would
open
up
the
country
as
no
trunk
railroad
will
ever
do
the
expense
would
be
great
both
of
construction
and
maintenance
but
it
would
probably
not
be
greater
than
the
cost
of
constructing
and
maintaining
the
proposed
railroad
twenty
or
thirty
ordinary
freight
trains
a
year
would
bring
in
all
the
goods
that
alaska
consumes
before
that
amount
can
be
very
greatly
increased
there
must
be
a
large
development
of
the
means
by
which
it
is
to
be
distributed
throughout
the
country
some
day
perhaps
these
roads
will
be
made
and
the
horse
not
the
dog
will
be
the
draught
animal
upon
them
yet
it
would
be
a
rash
conclusion
that
even
then
the
time
will
be
at
hand
when
there
will
be
no
longer
use
for
the
work
dog
in
alaska
away
from
these
main
arteries
of
travel
he
will
still
be
employed
so
long
as
great
part
of
the
land
remains
a
noble
arctic
wilderness
so
long
as
the
prospector
strikes
farther
and
farther
into
the
rugged
mountains
so
long
as
quick
travel
over
great
stretches
of
country
is
necessary
or
desirable
so
long
as
the
salmon
swarm
up
the
rivers
to
furnish
food
for
the
catching
so
long
as
the
indian
moves
from
fishing
camp
to
village
and
from
village
to
hunting
camp
so
long
will
the
dog
be
hitched
to
the
sled
in
alaska
so
long
will
his
joyful
yelp
and
his
plaintive
whine
be
heard
in
the
land
so
long
will
his
warm
tongue
seek
his
master
hand
even
the
hand
that
strikes
him
and
his
eloquent
eyes
speak
his
