notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors

notes
what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you

any

with
my

choices
please
feel
free

i

our

increast
by

voyages
i
often
made
to
epidamium
till
my

death
and
he
great
care
of

drew
me
from

embracements
of
my

from
whom
my
absence
was
not
sixe
moneths
olde
before
her
selfe
almost
at
fainting
vnder
the
pleasing
punishment
that
women
beare
had
made
prouision
for

following
me
and
soone
and
safe
arriued
where
i
was
there
had
she
not
beene
long
but
she
became
a
ioyfull
mother
of
two
goodly
sonnes
and
which
was
strange
the
one
so
like
the
other
as
could
not
be

but
by
names
that
very
howre
and
in
the
inne
a
meane

was
deliuered
of
such
a
burthen
male

both
alike
those
for
their

were
exceeding
poore

prowd
of

such
boyes
made

motions
for

returne
vnwilling
i
agreed
alas
too
soone
wee
came
aboord
a
league
from
epidamium
had
we
saild
before
the
alwaies
deepe
gaue
any
tragicke
instance
of
our
harme
but
longer
did
we
not
retaine
much
hope
for
what
obscured
light
the
heauens
did
grant
did
but
conuay
vnto
our
fearefull
mindes
a
doubtfull
warrant
of
immediate
death
which
though
my
selfe
would
gladly
haue
imbrac
yet
the
incessant
weepings
of
my
wife
weeping
before
for
what
she
saw
must
come
and
pitteous
playnings
of
the
prettie
babes
that
mourn
for
fashion
ignorant
what
to
feare
forst
me
to
seeke
delayes
for
them
and
me
and
this
it
was
for
other
meanes
was
none
the
sailors
sought
for
safety
by
our
boate
and
left
the
ship
then
sinking
ripe
to
my
wife
more
carefull
for
the
latter
borne
had
fastned
him
vnto
a
small
spare
mast
such
as
men
prouide
for
stormes
to
him
one
of
the
other
twins
was
bound
i
had
beene
like
heedfull
of
the
other
the
children
thus
dispos
my
wife
and
i
fixing
our
eyes
on
whom
our
care
was
fixt
fastned
our
selues
at
eyther
end
the
mast
and
floating
straight
obedient
to
the
streame
was
carried
towards
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
the
sonne
gazing
vpon
the
earth
disperst
those
vapours
that
offended
vs
and
by
the
benefit
of
his
wished
light
the
seas
waxt
calme
and
we
discouered
two
shippes
from
farre
making
amaine
to
vs
of
corinth
that
of
epidarus
this
but
ere
they
came
oh
let
me
say
no
more
gather
the
sequell
by
that
went
before
duk
nay
forward
old
man
doe
not
breake
off
so
for
we
may
pitty
though
not
pardon
thee
merch
oh
had
the
gods
done
so
i
had
not
now
worthily
tearm
them
mercilesse
to
vs
for
ere
the
ships
could
meet
by
twice
fiue
leagues
we
were
encountred
by
a
mighty
rocke
which
being
violently
borne
vp
our
helpefull
ship
was
splitted
in
the
midst
so
that
in
this
vniust
diuorce
of
vs
fortune
had
left
to
both
of
vs
alike
what
to
delight
in
what
to
sorrow
for
her
part
poore
soule
seeming
as
burdened
with
lesser
waight
but
not
with
lesser
woe
was
carried
with
more
speed
before
the
winde
and
in
our
sight
they
three
were
taken
vp
by
fishermen
of
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
another
ship
had
seiz
on
vs
and
knowing
whom
it
was
their
hap
to
saue
gaue
healthfull
welcome
to
their
guests
and
would
haue
reft
the
fishers
of
their
prey
had
not
their
backe
beene
very
slow
of
saile
and
therefore
homeward
did
they
bend
their
course
thus
haue
you
heard
me
seuer
from
my
blisse
that
by
misfortunes
was
my
life
prolong
to

no
time
for
a

ant
may
he
not
doe
it
by
fine
and
recouerie
yes
to
pay
a
fine
for
a
perewig
and
recouer
the
lost
haire
of
another
man
ant
why
is
time
such
a
niggard
of
haire
being
as
it
is
so
plentifull
an
excrement
because
it

why
but
theres
manie
a
man
hath
more
haire
then
wit
not
a
man
of
those
but
he
hath
the
wit
to
lose
his
haire
ant
why
thou
didst
conclude
hairy
men
plain
dealers
without
wit
the
plainer
dealer
the
sooner
lost
yet
he
looseth
it
in
a
kinde
of
iollitie
an
for
what
reason
for
two
and
sound
ones
to
an
nay
not
sound
i
pray
you
sure
ones
then
an
nay
not
sure
in
a
thing
falsing
certaine
ones
then
an
name
them
the
one
to
saue
the
money
that
he
spends
in
trying
the
other
that
at
dinner
they
should
not
drop
in
his
porrage
an
you
would
all
this
time
haue
prou
there
is
no
time
for
all
things
marry
and
did
sir
namely
in
no
time
to
recouer
haire
lost
by
nature
an
but
your
reason
was
not
substantiall
why
there
is
no
time
to
recouer
thus
i
mend
it
time
himselfe
is
bald
and
therefore
to
the
worlds
end
