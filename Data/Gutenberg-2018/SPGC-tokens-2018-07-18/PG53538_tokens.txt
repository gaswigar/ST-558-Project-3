of
criticism
every
now
and
then
a
sense
of
the
futility
of
their
daily
endeavors
falling
suddenly
upon
them
the
critics
of
christendom
turn
to
a
somewhat
sour
and
depressing
consideration
of
the
nature
and
objects
of
their
own
craft
that
is
to
say
they
turn
to
criticizing
criticism
what
is
it
in
plain
words
what
is
its
aim
exactly
stated
in
legal
terms
how
far
can
it
go
what
good
can
it
do
what
is
its
normal
effect
upon
the
artist
and
the
work
of
art
such
a
spell
of
has
been
in
progress
for
several
years
past
and
the
critics
of
various
countries
have
contributed
theories
of
more
or
less
lucidity
and
plausibility
to
the
discussion
their
views
of
their
own
art
it
appears
are
quite
as
divergent
as
their
views
of
the
arts
they
more
commonly
deal
with
one
group
argues
partly
by
direct
statement
and
partly
by
attacking
all
other
groups
that
the
one
defensible
purpose
of
the
critic
is
to
encourage
the
virtuous
and
oppose
the
brief
to
police
the
fine
arts
and
so
hold
them
in
tune
with
the
moral
order
of
the
world
another
group
repudiating
this
constabulary
function
argues
hotly
that
the
arts
have
nothing
to
do
with
morality
their
concern
is
solely
with
pure
beauty
a
third
group
holds
that
the
chief
aspect
of
a
work
of
art
particularly
in
the
field
of
literature
is
its
aspect
as
psychological
if
it
doesn
t
help
men
to
know
themselves
it
is
nothing
a
fourth
group
reduces
the
thing
to
an
exact
science
and
sets
up
standards
that
resemble
algebraic
is
the
group
of
metrists

contrapuntists

major
spingarn
a
major
spingarn
lately
served
formal
notice
upon
me
that
he
had
abandoned
the
life
of
the
academic
grove
for
that
of
the
armed
array
and
so
i
give
him
his
military
title
but
at
the
time
he
wrote
his
creative
criticism
he
was
a
professor
in
columbia
university
and
i
still
find
myself
thinking
of
him
not
as
a
soldier
extraordinarily
literate
but
as
a
professor
in
rebellion
for
his
notions
whatever
one
may
say
in
opposition
to
them
are
at
least
magnificently
fly
violently
in
the
face
of
the
principles
that
distinguish
the
largest
and
most
influential
group
of
campus
critics
as
witness
to
say
that
poetry
is
moral
or
immoral
is
as
meaningless
as
to
say
that
an
equilateral
triangle
is
moral
and
an
isosceles
triangle
or
worse
it
is
only
conceivable
in
a
world
in
which
conversation
runs
after
this
fashion
this
cauliflower
would
be
good
if
it
had
only
been
prepared
in
accordance
with
international
one
imagines
on
hearing
such
atheism
flying
about
the
amazed
indignation
of
william
lyon
phelps
with
his
discovery
that
joseph
conrad
preaches
the
axiom
of
the
moral
law
the
hey
what
s
that
of
brownell
the
amherst
aristotle
with
his
eloquent
plea
for
standards
as
as
the
westminster
confession
the
loud
patriotic
alarm
of
the
gifted
stuart
sherman
of
iowa
with
his
maxim
that
puritanism
is
the
official
philosophy
of
america
and
that
all
who
dispute
it
are
enemy
aliens
and
should
be
deported
major
spingarn
in
truth
here
performs
a
treason
most
horrible
upon
the
reverend
order
he
once
adorned
and
having
achieved
it
he
straightway
performs
another
and
then
another
that
is
to
say
he
tackles
all
the
antagonistic
groups
of
orthodox
critics
seriatim
and
knocks
them
about
the
aforesaid
agents
of
the
sweet
and
pious
then
the
advocates
of
unities
meters
all
rigid
formulæ
then
the
experts
in
imaginary
psychology
then
the
historical
comparers
pigeonholers
and
makers
of
categories
finally
the
professors
of
pure
æsthetic
one
and
all
they
take
their
places
upon
his
operating
table
and
one
and
all
they
are
stripped
and
anatomized
but
what
is
the
anarchistic
s
own
theory
a
professor
must
have
a
theory
as
a
dog
must
have
fleas
in
brief
what
he
offers
is
a
doctrine
borrowed
from
the
italian
benedetto
croce
and
by
croce
filched
from
doctrine
anything
but
new
in
the
world
even
in
goethe
s
time
but
nevertheless
long
buried
in
wit
the
doctrine
that
it
is
the
critic
s
first
and
only
duty
as
carlyle
once
put
it
to
find
out
what
the
poet
s
aim
really
and
truly
was
how
the
task
he
had
to
do
stood
before
his
eye
and
how
far
with
such
materials
as
were
afforded
him
he
has
fulfilled
for
poet
read
artist
or
if
literature
is
in
question
substitute
the
germanic
word
is
the
artist
in
words
the
creator
of
beautiful
letters
whether
in
verse
or
in
prose
ibsen
always
called
himself
a
not
a
or
so
i
daresay
did
shakespeare
well
what
is
this
generalized
poet
trying
to
do
asks
major
spingarn
and
how
has
he
done
it
that
and
no
more
is
the
critic
s
quest
the
morality
of
the
work
does
not
concern
him
it
is
not
his
business
to
determine
whether
it
heeds
aristotle
or
flouts
aristotle
he
passes
no
judgment
on
its
rhyme
scheme
its
length
and
breadth
its
iambics
its
politics
its
patriotism
its
piety
its
psychological
exactness
its
good
taste
he
may
note
these
things
but
he
may
not
protest
about
may
not
complain
if
the
thing
criticized
fails
to
fit
into
a
every
sonnet
every
drama
every
novel
is
it
must
stand
on
its
own
bottom
it
must
be
judged
by
its
own
inherent
intentions
poets
says
major
spingarn
do
not
really
write
epics
pastorals
lyrics
however
much
they
may
be
deceived
by
these
false
abstractions
they
express
and
this
expression
is
their
only
there
are
not
therefore
only
three
or
ten
or
a
hundred
literary
kinds
there
are
as
many
kinds
as
there
are
individual
nor
is
there
any
valid
appeal
the
character
and
background
of
the
poet
are
beside
the
mark
the
poem
itself
is
the
thing
oscar
wilde
weak
and
yet
wrote
beautiful
prose
to
reject
that
prose
on
the
ground
that
wilde
had
filthy
habits
is
as
absurd
as
to
reject
what
is
man
on
the
ground
that
its
theology
is
beyond
the
intelligence
of
the
editor
of
the
new
york
this
theory
of
course
throws
a
heavy
burden
upon
the
critic
it
presupposes
that
he
is
a
civilized
and
tolerant
man
hospitable
to
all
intelligible
ideas
and
capable
of
reading
them
as
he
runs
this
is
a
demand
that
at
once
rules
out
of
the
sophomores
who
carry
on
the
business
of
criticism
in
america
their
trouble
is
simply
that
they
lack
the
intellectual
resilience
necessary
for
taking
in
ideas
and
particularly
new
ideas
the
only
way
they
can
ingest
one
is
by
transforming
it
into
the
nearest
related
a
harsh
and
devastating
operation
this
fact
accounts
for
their
chronic
inability
to
understand
all
that
is
most
personal
and
original
and
hence
most
forceful
and
significant
in
the
emerging
literature
of
the
country
they
can
get
down
what
has
been
digested
and
redigested
and
so
brought
into
forms
that
they
know
and
carefully
labeled
by
predecessors
of
their
own
they
exhibit
alarm
immediately
they
come
into
the
presence
of
the
extraordinary
here
we
have
an
explanation
of
brownell
s
loud
appeal
for
a
tightening
of
a
larger
respect
for
precedents
patterns
here
we
have
an
explanation
of
phelps
s
inability
to
comprehend
the
colossal
phenomenon
of
dreiser
and
of
boynton
s
childish
nonsense
about
realism
and
of
sherman
s
effort
to
apply
the
espionage
act
to
the
arts
and
of
more
s
querulous
enmity
to
romanticism
and
of
all
the
fatuous
that
passes
for
criticism
in
the
more
solemn
literary
periodicals
as
practiced
by
all
such
learned
and
diligent
but
essentially
ignorant
and
unimaginative
men
criticism
is
little
more
than
a
branch
of
homiletics
they
judge
a
work
of
art
not
by
its
clarity
and
sincerity
not
by
the
force
and
charm
of
its
ideas
not
by
the
technical
virtuosity
of
the
artist
not
by
his
originality
and
artistic
courage
but
simply
and
solely
by
his
orthodoxy
if
he
is
what
is
called
a
right
thinker
if
he
devotes
himself
to
advocating
the
transient
platitudes
in
a
sonorous
manner
then
he
is
worthy
of
respect
but
if
he
lets
fall
the
slightest
hint
that
he
is
in
doubt
about
any
of
them
or
worse
still
that
he
is
indifferent
then
he
is
a
scoundrel
and
hence
by
their
theory
a
bad
artist
such
pious
piffle
is
horribly
familiar
among
us
i
do
not
exaggerate
its
terms
you
will
find
it
running
through
the
critical
writings
of
practically
all
the
dull
fellows
who
combine
criticism
with
tutoring
in
the
words
of
many
of
them
it
is
stated
in
the
plainest
way
and
defended
with
much
heat
theological
and
pedagogical
in
its
baldest
form
it
shows
itself
in
the
doctrine
that
it
is
scandalous
for
an
a
dramatist
or
a
depict
vice
as
attractive
the
fact
that
vice
more
often
than
not
undoubtedly
why
should
it
ever
gobble
any
of
us
disposed
of
with
a
lofty
gesture
what
of
it
say
these
the
artist
is
not
a
reporter
but
a
great
teacher
it
is
not
his
business
to
depict
the
world
as
it
is
but
as
it
ought
to
be
against
this
notion
american
criticism
makes
but
feeble
headway
we
are
in
fact
a
nation
of
evangelists
every
third
american
devotes
himself
to
improving
and
lifting
up
his
usually
by
force
the
messianic
delusion
is
our
national
disease
thus
the
moral
have
the
crowd
on
their
side
and
it
is
difficult
to
shake
their
authority
even
the
vicious
are
still
in
favor
of
crying
vice
down
here
is
a
novel
says
the
artist
why
didn
t
you
write
a
tract
roars
the
down
the
chute
go
novel
and
novelist
this
girl
is
pretty
says
the
painter
but
she
has
left
off
her
undershirt
protests
the
off
goes
the
poor
dauber
s
head
at
its
mildest
this
balderdash
takes
the
form
of
the
late
hamilton
wright
mabie
s
white
list
of
books
at
its
worst
it
is
comstockery
an
idiotic
and
abominable
thing
genuine
criticism
is
as
impossible
to
such
inordinately
narrow
and
cocksure
men
as
music
is
to
a
man
who
is
the
critic
to
interpret
his
artist
even
to
understand
his
artist
must
be
able
to
get
into
the
mind
of
his
artist
he
must
feel
and
comprehend
the
vast
pressure
of
the
creative
passion
as
major
spingarn
says
æsthetic
judgment
and
artistic
creation
are
instinct
with
the
same
vital
this
is
why
all
the
best
criticism
of
the
world
has
been
written
by
men
who
have
had
within
them
not
only
the
reflective
and
analytical
faculty
of
critics
but
also
the
gusto
of
carlyle
lessing
schlegel
and
to
drop
a
story
or
two
hazlitt
hermann
bahr
georg
brandes
and
james
huneker
huneker
tackling
also
sprach
zarathustra
revealed
its
content
in
illuminating
flashes
but
tackled
by
paul
elmer
more
it
became
no
more
than
a
dull
student
s
exercise
corrected
so
much
for
the
theory
of
major
spingarn
late
professor
of
modern
languages
and
literatures
in
columbia
university
obviously
it
is
a
far
sounder
and
more
stimulating
theory
than
any
of
those
cherished
by
the
other
professors
it
demands
that
the
critic
be
a
man
of
intelligence
of
toleration
of
wide
information
of
genuine
hospitality
to
ideas
whereas
the
others
only
demand
that
he
have
learning
and
accept
anything
as
learning
that
has
been
said
before
but
once
he
has
stated
his
doctrine
the
ingenious
immediately
begins
to
corrupt
it
by
claiming
too
much
for
it
having
laid
and
hatched
so
to
speak
his
somewhat
stale
but
still
highly
nourishing
egg
he
begins
to
argue
fatuously
that
the
resultant
flamingo
is
the
whole
mustering
of
the
critical
but
the
fact
is
of
course
that
criticism
as
humanly
practiced
must
needs
fall
a
good
deal
short
of
this
intuitive
recreation
of
beauty
and
what
is
more
it
must
go
a
good
deal
further
for
one
thing
it
must
be
interpretation
in
terms
that
are
not
only
exact
but
are
also
comprehensible
to
the
reader
else
it
will
leave
the
original
mystery
as
dark
as
once
interpretation
comes
in
paraphrase
and
transliteration
come
in
what
is
recondite
must
be
made
plainer
the
transcendental
to
some
extent
at
least
must
be
done
into
common
modes
of
thinking
well
what
are
morality
trochaics
hexameters
movements
historical
principles
psychological
maxims
the
dramatic
are
all
these
save
common
modes
of
thinking
short
cuts
rubber
stamps
words
of
one
syllable
moreover
beauty
as
we
know
it
in
this
world
is
by
no
means
the
apparition
that
spingarn
seems
to
see
it
has
its
social
its
political
even
its
moral
implications
the
finale
of
beethoven
s
c
minor
symphony
is
not
only
colossal
as
music
it
is
also
colossal
as
revolt
it
says
something
against
something
yet
more
the
springs
of
beauty
are
not
within
itself
alone
nor
even
in
genius
alone
but
often
in
things
without
brahms
wrote
his
deutsches
requiem
not
only
because
he
was
a
great
artist
but
also
because
he
was
a
good
german
and
in
nietzsche
there
are
times
when
the
divine
afflatus
takes
a
back
seat
and
the
have
the
floor
major
spingarn
himself
seems
to
harbor
some
sense
of
this
limitation
on
his
doctrine
he
gives
warning
that
the
poet
s
intention
must
be
judged
at
the
moment
of
the
creative
act
opens
the
door
enough
for
many
an
ancient
to
creep
in
but
limited
or
not
he
at
least
clears
off
a
lot
of
moldy
rubbish
and
gets
further
toward
the
truth
than
any
of
his
former
colleagues
they
waste
themselves
upon
theories
that
only
conceal
the
poet
s
achievement
the
more
the
more
diligently
they
are
applied
he
at
all
events
grounds
himself
upon
the
sound
notion
that
there
should
be
free
speech
in
art
and
no
protective
tariffs
and
no
assumptions
and
no
testing
of
ideas
by
mere
words
the
safe
ground
probably
lies
between
the
contestants
but
nearer
spingarn
the
critic
who
really
illuminates
starts
off
much
as
he
starts
off
but
with
a
due
regard
for
the
prejudices
and
imbecilities
of
the
world
i
think
the
best
feasible
practice
is
to
be
found
in
certain
chapters
of
huneker
a
critic
of
vastly
more
solid
influence
and
of
infinitely
more
value
to
the
arts
than
all
the
prating
pedagogues
since
rufus
griswold
here
as
in
the
case
of
poe
a
sensitive
and
intelligent
artist
recreates
the
work
of
other
artists
but
there
also
comes
to
the
ceremony
a
man
of
the
world
and
the
things
he
has
to
say
are
apposite
and
instructive
too
to
denounce
moralizing
out
of
hand
is
to
pronounce
a
moral
judgment
to
dispute
the
categories
is
to
set
up
a
new
category
and
to
admire
the
work
of
shakespeare
is
to
be
interested
in
his
handling
of
blank
verse
his
social
aspirations
his
marriage
and
his
frequent
concessions
to
the
bombastic
frenzy
of
his
actors
and
to
have
some
curiosity
about
the
really
competent
critic
must
be
an
empiricist
he
must
conduct
his
exploration
with
whatever
means
lie
within
the
bounds
of
his
personal
limitation
he
must
produce
his
effects
with
whatever
tools
will
work
if
pills
fail
he
gets
out
his
saw
if
the
saw
won
t
cut
he
seizes
a
club
perhaps
after
all
the
chief
burden
that
lies
upon
major
spingarn
s
theory
is
to
be
found
in
its
label
the
word
creative
is
a
bit
too
flamboyant
it
says
what
he
wants
to
say
but
it
probably
says
a
good
deal
more
in
this
emergency
i
propose
getting
rid
of
the
misleading
label
by
pasting
another
over
it
that
is
i
propose
the
substitution
of
catalytic
for
creative
despite
the
fact
that
catalytic
is
an
unfamiliar
word
and
suggests
the
of
the
seminaries
i
borrow
it
from
chemistry
and
its
meaning
is
really
quite
simple
a
catalyzer
in
chemistry
is
a
substance
that
helps
two
other
substances
to
react
for
example
consider
the
case
of
ordinary
cane
sugar
and
water
dissolve
the
sugar
in
the
water
and
nothing
happens
but
add
a
few
drops
of
acid
and
the
sugar
changes
into
glucose
and
fructose
meanwhile
the
acid
itself
is
absolutely
unchanged
all
it
does
is
to
stir
up
the
reaction
between
the
water
and
the
sugar
the
process
is
called
catalysis
the
acid
is
a
catalyzer
well
this
is
almost
exactly
the
function
of
a
genuine
critic
of
the
arts
it
is
his
business
to
provoke
the
reaction
between
the
work
of
art
and
the
spectator
the
spectator
untutored
stands
unmoved
he
sees
the
work
of
art
but
it
fails
to
make
any
intelligible
impression
on
him
if
he
were
spontaneously
sensitive
to
it
there
would
be
no
need
for
criticism
but
now
comes
the
critic
with
his
catalysis
he
makes
the
work
of
art
live
for
the
spectator
he
makes
the
spectator
live
for
the
work
of
art
out
of
the
process
comes
understanding
appreciation
intelligent
that
is
precisely
what
the
artist
tried
to
produce
ii
the
late
wells
the
man
as
artist
i
fear
is
by
some
sudden
and
romantic
catastrophe
like
his
own
richard
remington
but
after
a
process
of
gradual
and
obscure
decay
in
his
day
he
was
easily
the
most
brilliant
if
not
always
the
most
profound
of
contemporary
english
novelists
there
were
in
him
all
of
the
requisites
for
the
business
and
most
of
them
very
abundantly
he
had
a
lively
and
charming
imagination
he
wrote
with
the
utmost
fluency
and
address
he
had
humor
and
eloquence
he
had
a
sharp
eye
for
the
odd
and
intriguing
in
human
character
and
most
of
all
he
was
full
of
feeling
and
could
transmit
it
to
the
reader
that
high
day
of
his
lasted
say
from
to
it
began
with
and
ended
amid
the
last
scenes
of
marriage
as
the
play
of
scribe
gave
up
the
ghost
in
the
last
act
of
a
doll
s
there
in
marriage
were
the
first
faint
signs
of
something
wrong
invention
succumbed
to
theories
that
somehow
failed
to
hang
together
and
the
story
after
vast
heavings
incontinently
went
to
pieces
one
had
begun
with
an
acute
and
highly
diverting
study
of
monogamy
in
modern
london
one
found
one
s
self
toward
the
close
gaping
over
an
unconvincing
fable
of
marriage
in
the
stone
age
coming
directly
after
so
vivid
a
personage
as
remington
richard
godwin
trafford
simply
refused
to
go
down
and
his
marjorie
following
his
example
stuck
in
the
gullet
of
the
imagination
one
ceased
to
believe
in
them
when
they
set
out
for
labrador
and
after
that
it
was
impossible
to
revive
interest
in
them
the
more
they
were
explained
and
vivisected
and
drenched
with
theories
the
more
unreal
they
became
since
then
the
decline
of
wells
has
been
as
steady
as
his
rise
was
rapid
call
the
roll
of
his
books
and
you
will
discern
a
progressive
and
unmistakable
falling
off
into
the
passionate
friends
there
crept
the
first
downright
dullness
by
this
time
his
readers
had
become
familiar
with
his
machinery
and
his
elbowing
suffragettes
his
london
uplifters
his
smattering
of
his
intellectualized
adulteries
his
thackerayan
asides
his
paragraphs
his
journalistic
all
these
things
had
thus
begun
to
lose
the
blush
of
their
first
charm
to
help
them
out
he
heaved
in
larger
and
larger
doses
of
diverting
enough
and
sometimes
even
persuasive
but
in
the
long
run
a
poor
substitute
for
the
proper
ingredients
of
character
situation
and
human
passion
next
came
the
wife
of
sir
isaac
harman
an
attempt
to
rewrite
a
doll
s
house
with
a
fourth
act
in
terms
of
the
result
was
pages
of
bosh
a
flabby
and
tedious
piece
of
work
wells
for
the
first
time
in
the
rôle
of
unmistakable
bore
and
then
bealby
with
its
palais
royal
jocosity
its
running
in
and
out
of
doors
its
humor
of
physical
collision
its
reminiscences
of
a
trip
to
chinatown
and
peck
s
bad
and
then
boon
a
satire
often
incomprehensible
always
incommoded
by
its
disguise
as
a
novel
and
then
the
research
magnificent
a
poor
soup
from
the
dry
bones
of
nietzsche
and
then
mr
britling
sees
it
through
here
for
a
happy
moment
there
seemed
to
be
something
in
fact
a
recrudescence
of
the
wells
of
but
that
seeming
was
only
seeming
what
confused
the
judgment
was
the
enormous
popular
success
of
the
book
because
it
presented
a
englishman
in
an
heroic
aspect
because
it
sentimentalized
the
whole
reaction
of
the
english
proletariat
to
the
war
it
offered
a
subtle
sort
of
flattery
to
other
englishmen
and
to
americans
of
corresponding
degree
to
wit
the
second
thus
it
made
a
great
pother
and
was
hymned
as
a
masterpiece
in
such
gazettes
as
the
new
york
as
blasco
ibáñez
s
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
was
destined
to
be
hymned
three
years
later
but
there
was
in
the
book
in
point
of
fact
a
great
hollowness
and
that
hollowness
presently
begat
an
implosion
that
disposed
of
the
shell
i
daresay
many
a
returns
now
and
then
to
and
even
to
ann
but
surely
only
a
reader
with
absolutely
nothing
else
to
read
would
return
to
mr
britling
sees
it
there
the
soul
of
a
bishop
perhaps
the
worst
novel
ever
written
by
a
serious
novelist
since
began
and
perhaps
a
bit
before
or
idiotic
religious
tract
so
utterly
feeble
and
preposterous
that
even
the
scotchman
william
archer
could
not
stomach
it
and
then
to
make
an
end
came
joan
and
peter
the
collapse
of
wells
was
revealed
at
last
in
its
true
proportions
this
joan
and
peter
i
confess
lingers
in
my
memory
as
unpleasantly
as
a
summer
cold
and
so
in
retrospect
i
may
perhaps
exaggerate
its
intrinsic
badness
i
would
not
look
into
it
again
for
gold
and
frankincense
i
was
at
the
job
of
reading
it
for
days
and
days
endlessly
daunted
and
halted
by
its
laborious
dullness
its
flatulent
fatuity
its
almost
fabulous
inconsequentiality
it
was
and
is
nearly
impossible
to
believe
that
the
wells
of
and
the
history
of
polly
wrote
it
or
that
he
was
in
the
full
possession
of
his
faculties
when
he
allowed
it
to
be
printed
under
his
name
for
in
it
there
is
the
fault
that
the
wells
of
those
days
almost
beyond
any
other
fictioneer
of
the
time
was
incapable
fault
of
dismalness
of
witless
and
contagious
coma
of
the
evangelist
here
for
nearly
six
hundred
pages
of
fine
type
he
rolls
on
in
an
intellectual
cloud
boring
one
abominably
with
uninteresting
people
pointless
situations
revelations
that
reveal
nothing
arguments
that
have
no
appositeness
expositions
that
expose
naught
save
an
insatiable
and
torturing
garrulity
where
is
the
old
fine
address
of
the
man
where
is
his
sharp
eye
for
the
salient
and
significant
in
character
where
is
his
instinct
for
form
his
skill
at
putting
a
story
together
his
hand
for
making
it
unwind
itself
these
things
are
so
far
gone
that
it
becomes
hard
to
believe
that
they
ever
existed
there
is
not
the
slightest
sign
of
them
in
joan
and
the
book
is
a
botch
from
end
to
end
and
in
that
botch
there
is
not
even
the
palliation
of
an
arduous
enterprise
gallantly
attempted
no
inherent
difficulty
is
visible
the
story
is
anything
but
complex
and
surely
anything
but
subtle
its
badness
lies
wholly
in
the
fact
that
the
author
made
a
mess
of
the
writing
that
his
quondam
cunning
once
so
exhilarating
was
gone
when
he
began
it
reviewing
it
at
the
time
of
its
publication
i
inclined
momentarily
to
the
notion
that
the
war
was
to
blame
no
one
could
overestimate
the
cost
of
that
struggle
to
the
english
not
only
in
men
and
money
but
also
and
more
importantly
in
the
things
of
the
spirit
it
developed
national
traits
that
were
greatly
at
odds
with
the
old
ideal
of
extravagant
hysteria
a
tendency
to
whimper
under
blows
political
radicalism
and
credulity
it
overthrew
the
old
ruling
caste
of
the
land
and
gave
over
the
control
of
things
to
upstarts
from
the
lowest
jews
snuffling
methodists
prehensile
commercial
gents
disgusting
demagogues
all
sorts
of
adventurers
worst
of
all
the
strain
seemed
to
work
havoc
with
the
customary
dignity
and
reticence
and
even
with
the
plain
commonsense
of
many
englishmen
on
a
higher
level
and
in
particular
many
english
writers
the
astounding
bawling
of
kipling
and
the
no
less
astounding
bombast
of
chesterton
were
anything
but
isolated
there
were
in
fact
scores
of
other
eminent
authors
in
the
same
state
of
eruption
and
a
study
of
the
resultant
literature
of
objurgation
will
make
a
fascinating
job
for
some
sweating
of
say
out
of
göttingen
or
jena
it
occurred
to
me
as
i
say
that
wells
might
have
become
afflicted
by
this
same
demoralization
but
reflection
disposed
of
the
notion
on
the
one
hand
there
was
the
plain
fact
that
his
actual
writings
on
the
war
while
marked
by
the
bitterness
of
the
time
were
anything
but
insane
and
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
equally
plain
fact
that
his
decay
had
been
in
progress
a
long
while
before
the
germans
made
their
fateful
thrust
at
liége
the
precise
thing
that
ailed
him
i
found
at
last
on
page
of
the
american
edition
of
his
book
there
it
was
plainly
described
albeit
unwittingly
but
if
you
will
go
back
to
the
other
novels
since
marriage
you
will
find
traces
of
it
in
all
of
them
and
even
more
vivid
indications
in
the
books
of
exposition
and
philosophizing
that
have
accompanied
them
what
has
slowly
crippled
him
and
perhaps
disposed
of
him
is
his
gradual
acceptance
of
the
theory
corrupting
to
the
artist
and
scarcely
less
so
to
the
man
that
he
is
one
of
the
great
thinkers
of
his
era
charged
with
a
pregnant
message
to
the
younger
his
ideas
rammed
into
enough
skulls
will
save
the
empire
not
only
from
the
satanic
nietzscheism
of
the
hindenburgs
and
but
also
from
all
those
inner
weaknesses
that
taint
and
flabbergast
its
vitals
as
the
tapeworm
with
nineteen
heads
devoured
atharippus
of
macedon
in
brief
he
suffers
from
a
messianic
once
a
man
begins
to
suffer
from
a
messianic
delusion
his
days
as
a
serious
artist
are
ended
he
may
yet
serve
the
state
with
laudable
devotion
he
may
yet
enchant
his
millions
he
may
yet
posture
and
gyrate
before
the
world
as
a
man
of
mark
but
not
in
the
character
of
artist
not
as
a
creator
of
sound
books
not
in
the
separate
place
of
one
who
observes
the
eternal
tragedy
of
man
with
full
sympathy
and
understanding
and
yet
with
a
touch
of
godlike
remoteness
not
as
homer
saw
it
smiting
the
while
his
blooming
lyre
i
point
as
i
say
to
page
of
joan
and
peter
whereon
imperfectly
concealed
by
jocosity
you
will
find
wells
private
view
of
view
at
once
too
flattering
and
libelous
what
it
shows
is
the
absorption
of
the
artist
in
the
reformer
and
professional
wise
man
a
descent
indeed
the
man
impinged
upon
us
and
made
his
first
solid
success
not
as
a
merchant
of
banal
pedagogics
not
as
a
hawker
of
sociological
but
as
a
master
of
brilliant
and
representation
an
evoker
of
unaccustomed
but
none
the
less
emotions
a
dramatist
of
fine
imagination
and
highly
resourceful
execution
it
was
the
stupendous
drama
and
spectacle
of
modern
life
and
not
its
dubious
and
unintelligible
lessons
that
drew
him
from
his
and
and
made
an
artist
of
him
and
to
the
business
of
that
artist
once
he
had
served
his
apprenticeship
he
brought
a
vision
so
keen
a
point
of
view
so
fresh
and
sane
and
a
talent
for
exhibition
so
lively
and
original
that
he
straightway
conquered
all
of
us
nothing
could
exceed
the
sheer
radiance
of
it
is
a
work
that
glows
with
reality
it
projects
a
whole
epoch
with
unforgettable
effect
it
is
a
conceived
and
arranged
not
by
the
usual
or
chorus
man
but
by
an
extremely
civilized
and
sophisticated
observer
alert
to
every
detail
of
the
surface
and
yet
acutely
aware
of
the
internal
play
of
forces
the
essential
springs
the
larger
deeper
lines
of
it
in
brief
it
is
a
work
of
art
of
the
soundest
merit
for
it
both
represents
accurately
and
interprets
convincingly
and
under
everything
is
a
current
of
feeling
that
coordinates
and
informs
the
whole
but
in
the
success
of
the
book
and
of
the
two
or
three
following
it
there
was
a
temptation
and
in
the
temptation
a
peril
the
audience
was
there
high
in
expectation
eagerly
demanding
more
and
in
the
ego
of
the
true
proletarian
and
hence
born
with
morals
faiths
certainties
vasty
gaseous
was
an
urge
that
urge
it
seems
to
me
began
to
torture
him
when
he
set
about
the
passionate
in
the
presence
of
it
he
was
dissuaded
from
the
business
of
an
artist
discontented
with
the
business
of
an
artist
it
was
not
enough
to
display
the
life
of
his
time
with
accuracy
and
understanding
it
was
not
even
enough
to
criticize
it
with
a
penetrating
humor
and
sagacity
from
the
depths
of
his
being
like
some
foul
miasma
there
arose
the
old
fatuous
yearning
to
change
it
to
improve
it
to
set
it
right
where
it
was
wrong
to
make
it
over
according
to
some
pattern
superior
to
the
one
followed
by
the
lord
god
jehovah
with
this
sinister
impulse
as
aberrant
in
an
artist
as
a
taste
for
legs
in
an
archbishop
the
instinct
that
had
created
and
the
new
machiavelli
gave
battle
and
for
a
while
the
issue
was
in
doubt
but
with
marriage
its
trend
began
to
be
before
long
the
evangelist
was
triumphant
and
his
bray
battered
the
ear
and
in
the
end
there
was
a
quite
different
wells
before
us
and
a
wells
worth
infinitely
less
than
the
one
driven
off
one
must
put
him
where
he
has
begun
to
put
among
the
literary
artists
of
english
but
among
the
brummagem
prophets
of
england
his
old
rival
was
arnold
bennett
his
new
rival
is
the
fabian
society
or
maybe
lord
northcliffe
or
the
surviving
chesterton
or
the
later
hillaire
belloc
the
prophesying
business
is
like
writing
fugues
it
is
fatal
to
every
one
save
the
man
of
absolute
genius
the
lesser
wells
for
all
his
cleverness
is
surely
one
of
the
lesser
bound
to
come
to
grief
at
it
and
one
of
the
first
signs
of
his
coming
to
grief
is
the
drying
up
of
his
sense
of
humor
compare
the
soul
of
a
bishop
or
joan
and
peter
to
ann
veronica
or
the
history
of
one
notices
instantly
the
disappearance
of
the
comic
spirit
the
old
searching
brief
of
the
precise
thing
that
keeps
the
breath
of
life
in
arnold
bennett
it
was
in
boon
i
believe
that
this
irony
showed
its
last
flare
there
is
a
passage
in
that
book
which
somehow
lingers
in
the
memory
a
portrait
of
the
united
states
as
it
arose
in
the
mind
of
an
englishman
reading
the
of
yesteryear
a
vain
garrulous
and
prosperous
female
of
uncertain
age
and
still
more
uncertain
temper
with
unfounded
pretensions
to
intellectuality
and
an
idea
of
refinement
of
the
most
negative
description
the
aunt
errant
of
a
capital
blooming
almost
alone
a
sense
of
humor
had
it
been
able
to
survive
the
theology
would
certainly
have
saved
us
from
lady
sunderbund
in
the
soul
of
a
bishop
and
from
lady
charlotte
sydenham
in
joan
and
but
it
did
not
and
could
not
survive
it
always
withers
in
the
presence
of
the
messianic
delusion
like
justice
and
the
truth
in
front
of
patriotic
passion
what
takes
its
place
is
the
oafish
witless
buffoonishness
of
the
chautauquas
and
the
floor
of
example
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
an
intolerable
bore
of
nor
are
wells
ideas
as
he
has
so
laboriously
expounded
them
worth
the
sacrifice
of
his
old
lively
charm
they
are
in
fact
and
he
often
muddles
them
in
the
telling
in
first
and
last
things
he
preaches
a
flabby
socialism
and
then
toward
the
end
admits
frankly
that
it
doesn
t
work
in
boon
he
erects
a
whole
book
upon
an
platitude
to
wit
the
platitude
that
english
literature
in
these
latter
times
is
banality
indeed
for
his
own
argument
is
a
case
in
point
and
so
helps
to
prove
what
was
already
obvious
in
the
research
magnificent
he
smouches
an
idea
from
nietzsche
and
then
mauls
it
so
badly
that
one
begins
to
wonder
whether
he
is
in
favor
of
it
or
against
it
in
the
undying
fire
he
first
states
the
obvious
and
then
flees
from
it
in
alarm
in
his
war
books
he
borrows
right
and
wilson
from
the
british
socialists
from
romain
rolland
even
from
such
profound
thinkers
as
james
beck
and
the
editor
of
the
new
york
everything
that
he
borrows
is
flat
in
joan
and
peter
he
first
argues
that
england
is
going
to
pot
because
english
education
is
too
formal
and
archaic
and
then
that
germany
is
going
to
pot
because
german
education
is
too
realistic
and
opportunist
he
seems
to
respond
to
all
the
varying
crazes
and
fallacies
of
the
day
he
swallows
them
without
digesting
them
he
tries
to
substitute
mere
timeliness
for
reflection
and
feeling
and
under
all
the
of
bad
ideas
is
the
imbecile
assumption
of
the
jitney
messiah
at
all
times
and
everywhere
that
human
beings
may
be
made
over
by
changing
the
rules
under
which
they
live
that
progress
is
a
matter
of
intent
and
foresight
that
an
act
of
parliament
can
cure
the
blunders
and
check
the
practical
joking
of
god
such
notions
are
surely
no
baggage
for
a
serious
novelist
a
novelist
of
course
must
have
a
point
of
view
but
it
must
be
a
point
of
view
untroubled
by
the
crazes
of
the
moment
it
must
regard
the
internal
workings
and
meanings
of
existence
and
not
merely
its
superficial
appearances
a
novelist
must
view
life
from
some
secure
rock
drawing
it
into
a
definite
perspective
interpreting
it
upon
an
ordered
plan
even
if
he
hold
as
conrad
does
and
dreiser
and
hardy
and
anatole
france
that
it
is
essentially
meaningless
he
must
at
least
display
that
meaninglessness
with
reasonable
clarity
and
consistency
wells
shows
no
such
solid
and
intelligible
attitude
he
is
too
facile
too
enthusiastic
too
eager
to
teach
what
he
learned
yesterday
van
wyck
brooks
once
tried
to
reduce
the
whole
body
of
his
doctrine
to
a
succinct
statement
the
result
was
a
little
volume
a
great
deal
more
plausible
than
any
that
wells
himself
has
ever
also
one
that
probably
surprised
him
now
and
then
as
he
read
it
in
it
all
his
contradictions
were
reconciled
all
his
gaps
bridged
all
his
shifts
ameliorated
brooks
did
for
him
in
brief
what
william
bayard
hale
did
for
wilson
in
the
new
freedom
and
has
lived
to
regret
it
i
daresay
or
at
all
events
the
vain
labor
of
it
in
the
same
manner
what
remains
of
wells
there
remains
a
little
shelf
of
very
excellent
books
beginning
with
and
ending
with
it
is
a
shelf
flanked
on
the
one
side
by
a
long
row
of
extravagant
romances
in
the
manner
of
jules
verne
and
on
the
other
side
by
an
even
longer
row
of
puerile
tracts
but
let
us
not
underestimate
it
because
it
is
in
such
uninviting
company
there
is
on
it
some
of
the
liveliest
most
original
most
amusing
and
withal
most
respectable
fiction
that
england
has
produced
in
our
time
in
that
fiction
there
is
a
sufficient
memorial
to
a
man
who
between
two
debauches
of
claptrap
had
his
day
as
an
artist
iii
arnold
bennett
of
bennett
it
is
quite
easy
to
conjure
up
a
recognizable
picture
by
imaging
everything
that
wells
is
is
everything
interior
everything
having
to
do
with
attitudes
and
ideas
everything
beyond
the
mere
craft
of
arranging
words
in
ingratiating
sequences
as
stylists
of
course
they
have
many
points
of
contact
each
writes
a
journalese
that
is
extraordinarily
fluent
and
tuneful
each
is
apt
to
be
carried
away
by
the
rush
of
his
own
smartness
but
in
their
matter
they
stand
at
opposite
poles
wells
has
a
believing
mind
and
can
not
resist
the
lascivious
beckonings
and
of
meretricious
novelty
bennett
carries
skepticism
so
far
that
it
often
takes
on
the
appearance
of
a
mere
suspicion
of
ideas
bellicose
and
unintelligent
wells
is
astonishingly
intimate
and
confidential
and
more
than
one
of
his
novels
reeks
with
a
shameless
sort
of
autobiography
bennett
even
when
he
makes
use
of
personal
experience
contrives
to
get
impersonality
into
it
wells
finally
is
a
sentimentalist
and
can
not
conceal
his
feelings
bennett
of
all
the
english
novelists
of
the
day
is
the
most
steadily
aloof
and
ironical
this
habit
of
irony
in
truth
is
the
thing
that
gives
bennett
all
his
characteristic
color
and
is
at
the
bottom
of
both
his
peculiar
merit
and
his
peculiar
limitation
on
the
one
hand
it
sets
him
free
from
the
besetting
sin
of
the
contemporary
novelist
he
never
preaches
he
has
no
messianic
delusion
he
is
above
the
puerile
theories
that
have
engulfed
such
romantic
men
as
wells
winston
churchill
and
the
late
jack
london
and
even
at
times
such
sentimental
agnostics
as
dreiser
but
on
the
other
hand
it
leaves
him
empty
of
the
passion
that
is
when
all
is
said
and
done
the
chief
mark
of
the
true
novelist
the
trouble
with
him
is
that
he
can
not
feel
with
his
characters
that
he
never
involves
himself
emotionally
in
their
struggles
against
destiny
that
the
drama
of
their
lives
never
thrills
or
dismays
the
result
is
that
he
is
unable
to
arouse
in
the
reader
that
penetrating
sense
of
kinship
that
profound
and
instinctive
sympathy
which
in
its
net
effect
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
understanding
born
of
experiences
actually
endured
and
emotions
actually
shared
joseph
conrad
in
a
memorable
piece
of
criticism
once
put
the
thing
clearly
my
task
he
said
is
by
the
power
of
the
written
word
to
make
you
hear
to
make
you
is
above
all
to
make
you
here
seeing
it
must
be
obvious
is
no
more
than
feeling
put
into
physical
terms
it
is
not
the
outward
aspect
that
is
to
be
seen
but
the
inner
the
end
to
be
sought
by
that
apprehension
of
inner
truth
is
responsive
recognition
the
sympathy
of
poor
mortal
for
poor
mortal
the
tidal
uprush
of
feeling
that
makes
us
all
one
bennett
it
seems
to
me
can
not
evoke
it
his
characters
as
they
pass
have
a
deceptive
brilliance
of
outline
but
they
soon
fade
one
never
finds
them
haunting
the
memory
as
lord
jim
haunts
it
or
carrie
meeber
or
huck
finn
or
tom
jones
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
it
lies
in
the
plain
fact
that
they
appear
to
their
creator
not
as
men
and
women
whose
hopes
and
agonies
are
of
poignant
concern
not
as
tragic
comedians
in
isolated
and
concentrated
dramas
but
as
mean
figures
in
an
infinitely
dispersed
and
unintelligible
farce
as
helpless
nobodies
in
an
epic
struggle
that
transcends
both
their
volition
and
their
comprehension
thus
viewing
them
he
fails
to
humanize
them
completely
and
so
he
fails
to
make
their
emotions
contagious
they
are
in
their
way
often
vividly
real
they
are
thoroughly
accounted
for
what
there
is
of
them
is
unfailingly
they
move
and
breathe
in
an
environment
that
pulses
and
glows
but
the
attitude
of
the
author
toward
them
remains
in
the
end
the
attitude
of
a
biologist
toward
his
laboratory
animals
he
does
not
with
neither
does
his
reader
bennett
s
chief
business
in
fact
is
not
with
individuals
at
all
even
though
he
occasionally
brings
them
up
almost
to
what
concerns
him
principally
is
the
common
life
of
large
groups
the
action
and
reaction
of
castes
and
classes
the
struggle
among
societies
in
particular
he
is
engrossed
by
the
colossal
and
disorderly
functioning
of
the
english
middle
division
of
mankind
inordinately
mixed
in
race
confused
in
ideals
and
illogical
in
ideas
it
is
a
group
that
has
had
interpreters
aplenty
past
and
present
a
full
half
of
the
literature
of
the
victorian
era
was
devoted
to
it
but
never
i
believe
has
it
had
an
interpreter
more
resolutely
detached
and
has
it
had
one
less
shaken
by
emotional
involvement
here
the
very
lack
that
detracts
so
much
from
bennett
s
stature
as
a
novelist
in
the
conventional
sense
is
converted
into
a
valuable
possession
better
than
any
other
man
of
his
time
he
has
got
upon
paper
the
social
anatomy
and
physiology
of
the
masses
of
average
everyday
unimaginative
englishmen
one
leaves
the
long
series
of
five
towns
books
with
a
sense
of
having
looked
down
the
tube
of
a
microscope
upon
a
huge
swarm
of
infinitely
little
but
incessantly
struggling
engaged
furiously
in
the
pursuit
of
grotesque
and
unintelligible
participants
in
and
victims
of
a
struggle
that
takes
on
to
their
eyes
a
thousand
lofty
purposes
all
of
them
puerile
to
the
observer
above
its
turmoil
here
he
seems
to
say
is
the
middle
the
average
the
typical
englishman
here
is
the
fellow
as
he
appears
to
laborious
important
intelligent
made
in
god
s
image
and
here
he
is
in
ineffective
inconsequential
stupid
a
feeble
parody
upon
his
maker
it
is
irony
that
penetrates
and
devastates
and
it
is
unrelieved
by
any
show
of
the
pity
that
gets
into
the
irony
of
conrad
or
of
the
tolerant
claim
of
kinship
that
mitigates
that
of
fielding
and
thackeray
it
is
harsh
and
cocksure
it
has
at
its
moments
some
flavor
of
actual
bounderism
one
instinctively
shrinks
from
so
a
pulling
off
of
underclothes
and
unveiling
of
warts
it
is
easy
to
discern
in
it
indeed
a
note
of
distinct
hostility
and
even
of
disgust
the
long
exile
of
the
author
is
not
without
its
significance
he
not
only
got
in
france
something
of
the
frenchman
s
aloof
and
disdainful
view
of
the
english
he
must
have
taken
a
certain
distaste
for
the
national
scene
with
him
in
the
first
place
else
he
would
not
have
gone
at
all
the
same
attitude
shows
itself
in
george
another
englishman
smeared
with
gallic
foreignness
both
men
it
will
be
recalled
reacted
to
the
tremendous
emotional
assault
of
the
war
not
by
yielding
to
it
ecstatically
in
the
manner
of
the
unpolluted
islanders
but
by
shrinking
from
it
into
a
reserve
that
was
naturally
misunderstood
george
has
put
his
sniffs
into
blind
alley
bennett
has
got
his
into
the
pretty
i
do
not
say
that
either
book
is
positively
french
what
i
do
say
is
that
both
mirror
an
attitude
that
has
been
somehow
emptied
of
mere
nationalism
an
italian
adventure
i
daresay
would
have
produced
the
same
effect
or
a
spanish
or
russian
or
german
but
it
happened
to
be
french
what
the
bennett
story
attempts
to
do
is
what
every
serious
bennett
story
attempts
to
do
to
exhibit
dramatically
the
great
gap
separating
the
substance
from
the
appearance
in
the
english
character
it
seems
to
me
that
its
prudent
and
hoape
is
a
vastly
more
real
englishman
of
his
class
and
what
is
more
an
englishman
vastly
more
useful
and
creditable
to
england
than
any
of
the
gaudy
bayards
and
cids
of
conventional
war
fiction
here
indeed
the
irony
somehow
fails
the
man
we
are
obviously
expected
to
disdain
converts
himself
toward
the
end
into
a
man
not
without
his
touches
of
the
admirable
he
is
no
hero
god
knows
and
there
is
no
more
brilliance
in
him
than
you
will
find
in
an
average
country
squire
or
parliament
man
but
he
has
the
rare
virtue
of
common
sense
and
that
is
probably
the
virtue
that
has
served
the
english
better
than
all
others
curiously
enough
the
english
reading
public
recognized
the
irony
but
failed
to
observe
its
confutation
and
so
the
book
got
bennett
into
bad
odor
at
home
and
into
worse
odor
among
the
sedulous
apes
of
english
ideas
and
emotions
on
this
side
of
the
water
but
it
is
a
sound
work
sound
work
with
a
large
and
unescapable
defect
that
defect
is
visible
in
a
good
many
of
the
other
things
that
bennett
has
done
it
is
the
product
of
his
emotional
detachment
and
it
commonly
reveals
itself
as
an
inability
to
take
his
own
story
seriously
sometimes
he
pokes
open
fun
at
it
as
in
the
more
often
he
simply
abandons
it
before
it
is
done
as
if
weary
of
a
too
tedious
foolery
this
last
process
is
plainly
visible
in
the
pretty
the
thing
that
gives
form
and
direction
to
that
story
is
a
simple
enough
problem
in
psychology
to
wit
what
will
happen
when
a
man
of
sound
education
and
decent
instincts
of
sober
age
and
prudent
habit
of
common
sense
and
even
of
certain
mild
will
happen
logically
and
naturally
when
such
a
normal
respectable
cautious
fellow
finds
himself
disquietingly
in
love
with
a
lady
of
no
position
at
brief
with
a
lady
but
lately
of
the
town
bennett
sets
the
problem
and
for
a
couple
of
hundred
pages
investigates
it
with
the
utmost
ingenuity
and
address
exposing
and
discussing
its
tracing
the
gradual
shifting
of
its
terms
prodding
with
sharp
insight
into
the
psychological
material
entering
into
it
and
then
as
if
suddenly
tired
of
as
if
suddenly
convinced
that
the
thing
has
gone
on
long
enough
that
he
has
given
the
public
enough
of
a
book
for
its
forthwith
evades
the
solution
altogether
and
brings
down
his
curtain
upon
a
palpably
artificial
dénouement
the
device
murders
the
book
one
is
arrested
at
the
start
by
a
fascinating
statement
of
the
problem
one
follows
a
discussion
of
it
that
shows
bennett
at
his
brilliant
best
fertile
in
detail
alert
to
every
twist
of
motive
incisively
ironical
at
every
then
at
the
end
one
is
incontinently
turned
out
of
the
booth
the
effect
is
that
of
being
assaulted
with
an
by
a
hitherto
amiable
bartender
almost
that
of
being
bitten
by
a
pretty
girl
in
the
midst
of
an
amicable
buss
that
effect
unluckily
is
no
stranger
to
the
reader
of
bennett
novels
one
encounters
it
in
many
of
them
there
is
a
tremendous
marshaling
of
meticulous
and
illuminating
observation
the
background
throbs
with
color
the
sardonic
humor
is
never
failing
it
is
a
capital
always
one
goes
away
from
it
with
a
sense
of
having
missed
the
conclusion
always
there
is
a
final
begging
of
the
question
it
is
not
hard
to
perceive
the
attitude
of
mind
underlying
this
chronic
evasion
of
issues
it
is
in
essence
agnosticism
carried
to
the
last
place
of
decimals
life
itself
is
meaningless
therefore
the
discussion
of
life
is
meaningless
therefore
why
try
futilely
to
get
a
meaning
into
it
the
reasoning
unluckily
has
holes
in
it
it
may
be
sound
logically
but
it
is
psychologically
unworkable
one
goes
to
novels
not
for
the
bald
scientific
fact
but
for
a
romantic
amelioration
of
it
when
they
carry
that
amelioration
to
the
point
of
uncritical
certainty
when
they
are
full
of
ideas
that
click
and
whirl
like
machines
then
the
mind
revolts
against
the
childish
naïveté
of
the
thing
but
when
there
is
no
organization
of
the
spectacle
at
all
when
it
is
presented
as
a
mere
formless
panorama
when
to
the
sense
of
its
unintelligibility
is
added
the
suggestion
of
its
inherent
chaos
then
the
mind
revolts
no
less
art
can
never
be
simple
representation
it
can
not
deal
solely
with
precisely
what
is
it
must
at
the
least
present
the
real
in
the
light
of
some
recognizable
ideal
it
must
give
to
the
eternal
farce
if
not
some
moral
then
at
all
events
some
direction
for
without
that
formulation
there
can
be
no
separation
of
the
individual
will
from
the
general
stew
and
turmoil
of
things
and
without
that
separation
there
can
be
no
coherent
drama
and
without
that
drama
there
can
be
no
evocation
of
emotion
and
without
that
emotion
art
is
unimaginable
the
field
of
the
novel
is
very
wide
there
is
room
on
the
one
side
for
a
brilliant
play
of
ideas
and
theories
provided
only
they
do
not
stiffen
the
struggle
of
man
with
man
or
of
man
with
destiny
into
a
mere
struggle
of
abstractions
there
is
room
on
the
other
side
for
the
most
complete
agnosticism
provided
only
it
be
tempered
by
feeling
joseph
conrad
is
quite
as
unshakable
an
agnostic
as
bennett
he
is
a
ten
times
more
implacable
ironist
but
there
is
yet
a
place
in
his
scheme
for
a
sardonic
sort
of
pity
and
pity
however
sardonic
is
perhaps
as
good
an
emotion
as
another
the
trouble
with
bennett
is
that
he
essays
to
sneer
not
only
at
the
futile
aspiration
of
man
but
also
at
the
agony
that
goes
with
it
the
result
is
an
air
of
affectation
of
superficiality
almost
of
stupidity
the
manner
on
the
one
hand
is
that
of
a
highly
skillful
and
profoundly
original
artist
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
that
of
a
sophomore
just
made
aware
of
haeckel
bradlaugh
and
nietzsche
bennett
s
unmitigated
skepticism
explains
two
things
that
have
constantly
puzzled
the
reviewers
and
that
have
been
the
cause
of
a
great
deal
of
idiotic
writing
about
him
as
well
as
against
him
one
of
these
things
is
his
utter
lack
of
anything
properly
describable
as
artistic
extreme
readiness
to
play
the
star
houri
in
the
seraglio
of
the
publishers
the
other
is
his
habit
of
translating
platitudes
into
racy
journalese
and
gravely
offering
them
to
the
suburban
trade
as
pocket
both
crimes
it
seems
to
me
have
their
rise
in
his
congenital
incapacity
for
taking
ideas
seriously
even
including
his
own
if
this
he
appears
to
say
is
the
tosh
you
want
then
here
is
another
dose
of
it
personally
i
have
little
interest
in
that
sort
of
thing
even
good
best
i
can
no
more
than
compromises
with
a
silly
convention
i
am
not
interested
in
stories
i
am
interested
in
the
anatomy
of
human
melancholy
i
am
a
descriptive
sociologist
with
overtones
of
malice
but
if
you
want
stories
and
can
pay
for
them
i
am
willing
to
give
them
to
you
and
if
you
prefer
bad
stories
then
here
is
a
bad
one
don
t
assume
you
can
shame
me
by
deploring
my
willingness
think
of
what
your
doctors
do
every
day
and
your
lawyers
and
your
men
of
god
and
your
stockbrokers
and
your
traders
and
politicians
i
am
surely
no
worse
than
the
average
in
fact
i
am
probably
a
good
deal
superior
to
the
average
for
i
am
at
least
not
deceived
by
my
own
at
least
know
my
sound
goods
from
my
such
i
daresay
is
the
process
of
thought
behind
such
hollow
as
buried
alive
and
the
lion
s
one
does
not
need
the
man
s
own
amazing
confidences
to
hear
his
snickers
at
his
audience
at
his
work
and
at
himself
the
books
of
philosophy
in
the
manner
of
orison
swett
marden
and
frank
crane
and
the
occasional
for
the
newspapers
and
magazines
probably
have
much
the
same
origin
what
appears
in
them
is
not
a
weakness
for
ideas
that
are
stale
and
obvious
but
a
distrust
of
all
ideas
whatsoever
the
public
with
its
mob
yearning
to
be
instructed
edified
and
pulled
by
the
nose
demands
certainties
it
must
be
told
definitely
and
a
bit
raucously
that
this
is
true
and
that
is
false
but
there
no
certainties
one
notion
is
as
good
as
another
and
if
it
happens
to
be
utter
flubdub
so
much
the
it
is
precisely
flubdub
that
penetrates
the
popular
skull
with
the
greatest
facility
the
way
is
already
made
the
hole
already
gapes
an
effort
to
approach
the
hidden
and
baffling
truth
would
simply
burden
the
enterprise
with
difficulty
moreover
the
effort
is
intrinsically
laborious
and
ungrateful
moreover
there
is
probably
no
hidden
truth
to
be
uncovered
thus
by
the
route
of
skepticism
bennett
apparently
arrives
at
his
that
he
actually
believes
in
his
own
theorizing
is
inconceivable
he
is
far
too
intelligent
a
man
to
hold
that
any
truths
within
the
comprehension
of
the
popular
audience
are
sound
enough
to
be
worth
preaching
or
that
it
would
do
any
good
to
preach
them
if
they
were
no
doubt
he
is
considerably
amused
by
the
gravity
with
which
his
bedizened
platitudes
have
been
received
by
persons
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
fare
particularly
in
america
it
would
be
interesting
to
hear
his
private
view
of
the
critics
who
hymn
him
as
a
profound
and
impassioned
moralist
with
a
mission
to
rescue
the
plain
people
from
the
heresies
of
such
fellows
as
dreiser
so
much
for
two
of
the
salient
symptoms
of
his
underlying
skepticism
another
is
to
be
found
in
his
incapacity
to
be
in
the
ordinary
sense
ingratiating
it
is
simply
beyond
him
to
say
the
pleasant
thing
with
any
show
of
sincerity
of
all
his
books
probably
the
worst
are
his
book
on
the
war
and
his
book
on
the
united
states
the
latter
was
obviously
undertaken
with
some
notion
of
paying
off
a
debt
bennett
had
been
to
the
united
states
the
newspapers
had
hailed
him
in
their
way
the
women
s
clubs
had
pawed
over
him
he
had
no
doubt
come
home
a
good
deal
richer
what
he
essayed
to
do
was
to
write
a
volume
on
the
republic
that
should
be
at
once
colorably
accurate
and
discreetly
agreeable
the
enterprise
was
quite
beyond
him
the
book
not
only
failed
to
please
americans
it
offended
them
in
a
thousand
subtle
ways
and
from
its
appearance
dates
the
decline
of
the
author
s
vogue
among
us
he
is
not
of
course
completely
forgotten
but
it
must
be
plain
that
wells
now
stands
a
good
deal
above
him
in
the
popular
the
later
wells
of
bad
novel
after
bad
novel
his
war
book
missed
fire
in
much
the
same
way
it
was
workmanlike
it
was
deliberately
urbane
it
was
undoubtedly
it
fell
flat
in
england
and
it
fell
flat
in
america
there
is
no
little
significance
in
the
fact
that
the
british
government
in
looking
about
for
english
authors
to
uphold
the
british
cause
in
america
and
labor
for
american
participation
in
the
war
found
no
usefulness
in
bennett
practically
every
other
novelist
with
an
american
audience
was
drafted
for
service
but
not
bennett
he
was
during
the
heat
of
the
fray
and
when
at
length
he
came
forward
with
the
pretty
lady
the
pained
manner
with
which
it
was
received
quite
justified
the
judgment
of
those
who
had
passed
him
over
what
all
this
amounts
to
may
be
very
briefly
put
in
one
of
the
requisite
qualities
of
the
novelist
bennett
is
almost
completely
lacking
and
so
it
would
be
no
juggling
with
paradox
to
argue
that
at
bottom
he
is
scarcely
a
novelist
at
all
his
books
indeed
is
his
serious
books
the
books
of
his
better
fail
utterly
to
achieve
the
effect
that
one
associates
with
the
true
novel
one
carries
away
from
them
not
the
impression
of
a
definite
transaction
not
the
memory
of
an
outstanding
and
appealing
personality
not
the
of
a
profound
emotion
but
merely
the
sense
of
having
witnessed
a
gorgeous
but
incomprehensible
parade
coming
out
of
nowhere
and
going
to
god
knows
where
they
are
magnificent
as
representation
they
bristle
with
charming
detail
they
radiate
the
humors
of
an
acute
and
extraordinary
man
they
are
entertainment
of
the
best
there
is
seldom
anything
in
them
of
that
clear
and
solid
effect
which
one
associates
with
the
novel
as
work
of
art
most
of
these
books
indeed
are
no
more
than
collections
of
essays
defectively
dramatized
what
is
salient
in
them
is
not
their
people
but
their
their
people
are
forever
fading
into
their
backgrounds
is
there
a
character
in
any
of
these
books
that
shows
any
sign
of
living
as
pendennis
lives
and
barry
lyndon
and
emma
bovary
and
david
copperfield
and
the
george
moore
who
is
always
his
own

remembers
much
about

that

no
more
than
an

only
inscrutable
she
is
also
dim
the
man
and
woman
of
whom
god
hath
joined
perhaps
the
best
of
all
the
bennett
novels
i
have
so
far
forgotten
that
i
can
not
remember
their
names
even
denry
the
audacious
grows
misty
one
remembers
that
he
was
the
center
of
the
farce
but
now
he
is
long
gone
and
the
farce
remains
this
constant
remainder
whether
he
be
actually
novelist
or
no
novelist
is
sufficient
to
save
bennett
it
seems
to
me
from
the
swift
oblivion
that
so
often
overtakes
the
popular
fictioneer
he
may
not
play
the
game
according
to
the
rules
but
the
game
that
he
plays
is
nevertheless
extraordinarily
diverting
and
calls
for
an
incessant
display
of
the
finest
sort
of
skill
no
writer
of
his
time
has
looked
into
the
life
of
his
time
with
sharper
eyes
or
set
forth
his
findings
with
a
greater
charm
and
plausibility
within
his
deliberately
narrow
limits
he
had
done
precisely
the
thing
that
balzac
undertook
to
do
and
zola
after
him
he
has
painted
a
portrait
of
a
whole
society
accurately
brilliantly
and
in
certain
areas
almost
exhaustively
the
middle
the
individual
but
the
there
displayed
more
vividly
than
he
is
displayed
anywhere
else
that
i
know
of
the
thing
is
rigidly
held
to
its
aim
there
is
no
episodic
descent
or
ascent
to
other
fields
but
within
that
one
field
every
resource
of
observation
of
invention
and
of
imagination
has
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
one
save
that
deep
feeling
for
man
in
his
bitter
tragedy
which
is
the
most
important
of
them
all
bennett
whatever
his
failing
in
this
capital
function
of
the
artist
is
certainly
of
the
very
highest
consideration
as
craftsman
scattered
through
his
books
even
his
bad
books
there
are
fragments
of
writing
that
are
quite
unsurpassed
in
our
episode
in
the
pretty
lady
the
adulterous
interlude
in
whom
god
hath
joined
the
dinner
party
in
paris
nights
the
whole
discussion
of
the
marriage
in
the
the
studio
party
in
the
lion
s
such
writing
is
rare
and
exhilarating
it
is
to
be
respected
and
the
man
who
did
it
is
not
to
be
dismissed

them

question

of
american
letters
in
point
of
years
and
in
point
of
published
quantity
and
in
point
of
public
prominence
and
influence
he
has
been
gradually
enveloped
in
a
web
of
superstitious
reverence
and
it
grates
harshly
to
hear
his
actual
achievement
discussed
in
cold
blood
nevertheless
all
this
merited
respect
for
an
industrious
and
inoffensive
man
is
bound
soon
or
late
to
yield
to
a
critical
examination
of
the
artist
within
and
that
examination
i
fear
will
have
its
bitter
moments
for
those
who
naïvely
accept

legend

will
show
without
doubt
a
journeyman
a
contriver
of
pretty
things
a
clever

will
also
show
a
long
row
of
uninspired
and
hollow
books
with
no
more
ideas
in
them
than
so
many
volumes
of
the
home
and
no
more
deep
and
contagious
feeling
than
so
many
reports
of
autopsies
and
no
more
glow
and
gusto
than
so
many
tables
of

the
profound
dread
and
agony
of
life
the
surge
of
passion
and
aspiration
the
grand
crash
and
glitter
of
things
the
tragedy
that
runs
eternally
under
the
this
the
critic
of
the
future
will
seek
in
vain
in
howells
elegant
and
shallow
volumes
and
seeking
it
in
vain
he
will
probably
dismiss
all
of
them
together
with
fewer
words
than
he
gives
to
huckleberry
already
indeed
the
howells
legend
tends
to
become
a
mere
legend
and
empty
of
all
genuine
significance
who
actually
reads
the
howells
novels
who
even
remembers
their
names
the
minister
s
charge
an
imperative
duty
the
unexpected
guests
out
of
the
question
no

are

as

perhaps
the

go
read
it
if
you
would
tumble
downstairs
the
truth
about
howells
is
that
he
really
has
nothing
to
say
for
all
the
charm
he
gets
into
saying
it
his
psychology
is
superficial
amateurish
often
nonsensical
his
irony
is
scarcely
more
than
a
polite
facetiousness
his
characters
simply
refuse
to
live
no
figure
even
remotely
comparable
to
norris
mcteague
or
dreiser
s
frank
cowperwood
is
to
be
encountered
in
his
novels
he
is
quite
unequal
to
any
such
evocation
of
the
of
the
essential
conflict
of
forces
among
us
of
the
peculiar
drift
and
color
of
american
life
the
world
he
moves
in
is
suburban
caged
flabby
he
could
no
more
have
written
the
last
chapters
of
lord
jim
than
he
could
have
written
the
book
of
mark
the
vacuity
of
his
method
is
well
revealed
by
one
of
the
books
of
his
old
age
the
leatherwood
its
composition
we
are
told
spread
over
many
years
its
genesis
was
in
the
days
of
his
full
maturity
an
examination
of
it
shows
nothing
but
a
suave
piling
up
of
words
a
vast
accumulation
of
nothings
the
central
character
one
dylks
is
a
backwoods
evangelist
who
acquires
a
belief
in
his
own
buncombe
and
ends
by
announcing
that
he
is
god
the
job
before
the
author
was
obviously
that
of
tracing
the
psychological
steps
whereby
this
mountebank
proceeds
to
that
conclusion
the
fact
indeed
is
recognized
in
the
canned
review
which
says
that
the
book
is
a
study
of
american
religious
but
an
inspection
of
the
text
shows
that
no
such
study
is
really
in
it
howells
does
not
how
dylks
came
to
believe
himself
god
he
merely
that
he
did
so
the
whole
discussion
of
the
process
indeed
is
confined
to
two
and
is
quite
infantile
in
its
inadequacy
nor
do
we
get
anything
approaching
a
revealing
look
into
the
heads
of
the
other
methodists
and
baptists
of
a
remote
ohio
settlement
of
seventy
or
eighty
years
ago
all
we
have
is
the
casual
statement
that
they
are
converted
and
begin
to
offer
dylks
their
howls
of
devotion
and
when
in
the
end
they
go
back
to
their
original
bosh
dethroning
dylks
overnight
and
restoring
the
gaseous
vertebrate
of
calvin
and
this
contrary
process
is
recorded
it
is
accompanied
by
no
more
illumination
in
brief
the
story
is
not
a
study
at
all
whether
psychological
or
otherwise
but
simply
an
anecdote
and
without
either
point
or
interest
its
virtues
are
all
negative
ones
it
is
short
it
keeps
on
the
track
it
deals
with
a
religious
maniac
and
yet
contrives
to
offer
no
offense
to
other
religious
maniacs
but
on
the
positive
side
it
merely
skims
the
skin
so
in
all
of
the
other
howells
novels
that
i
know
somehow
he
seems
blissfully
ignorant
that
life
is
a
serious
business
and
full
of
mystery
it
is
a
sort
of
college
town
that
one
finds
in
him
he
is
an
agnes
repplier
in
pantaloons
in
one
of
the
later
stories
new
leaf
mills
he
makes
a
faltering
gesture
of
recognition
here
so
to
speak
one
gets
at
least
a
sniff
of
the
universal
mystery
howells
seems
about
to
grow
profound
at
last
but
the
sniff
is
only
a
sniff
the
tragedy
at
the
end
peters
out
compare
the
story
to
howe
s
the
story
of
a
country
town
which
howells
himself
has
intelligently
praised
and
you
will
get
some
measure
of
his
own
failure
howe
sets
much
the
same
stage
and
deals
with
much
the
same
people
his
story
is
full
of
technical
one
thing
it
is
overladen
with
melodrama
and
sentimentality
but
nevertheless
it
achieves
the
prime
purpose
of
a
work
of
the
imagination
it
grips
and
stirs
the
emotions
it
implants
a
sense
of
something
experienced
such
a
book
leaves
scars
one
is
not
quite
the
same
after
reading
it
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
to
a
howells
book
that
produces
any
such
effect
if
he
actually
tries
like
conrad
to
make
you
hear
to
make
you
all
to
make
you
then
he
fails
almost
completely
one
often
suspects
indeed
that
he
doesn
t
really
feel
or
see
himself
as
a
critic
he
belongs
to
a
higher
level
if
only
because
of
his
eager
curiosity
his
gusto
in
novelty
his
praise
of
howe
i
have
mentioned
he
dealt
valiant
licks
for
other
débutantes
frank
norris
edith
wharton
and
william
vaughn
moody
among
them
he
brought
forward
the
russians
diligently
and
persuasively
albeit
they
left
no
mark
upon
his
own
manner
in
his
ingratiating
way
back
in
the
seventies
and
eighties
he
made
war
upon
the
prevailing
sentimentalities
but
his
history
as
a
critic
is
full
of
errors
and
omissions
one
finds
him
loosing
a
fanfare
for
trites
the
philadelphia
zola
and
praising
frank
one
finds
him
leaving
the
discovery
of
all
the
shaws
george
moores
dreisers
synges
galsworthys
phillipses
and
george
ades
to
the
pollards
meltzers
and
hunekers
busy
in
the
sideshows
he
didn
t
see
the
elephants
go
by
here
temperamental
defects
handicapped
him
turn
to
his
my
mark
twain
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
the
mark
that
is
exhibited
in
this
book
is
a
mark
whose
himalayan
outlines
are
discerned
but
hazily
through
a
pink
fog
of
howells
there
is
a
moral
note
in
the
obvious
effort
to
palliate
to
touch
up
to
excuse
the
poor
fellow
of
course
was
charming
and
there
was
talent
in
him
but
what
a
weakness
he
had
for
thinking
such
shocking
thoughts
what
oaths
in
his
speech
what
awful
cigars
he
smoked
how
barbarous
his
contempt
for
the
strict
sonata
form
it
seems
incredible
indeed
that
two
men
so
unlike
should
have
found
common
denominators
for
a
friendship
lasting
years
the
one
derived
from
rabelais
chaucer
the
elizabethans
and
of
the
literary
high
seas
loud
laughers
giants
of
a
lordlier
day
the
other
came
down
from
jane
austen
washington
irving
and
hannah
more
the
one
wrote
english
as
michelangelo
hacked
marble
broadly
brutally
magnificently
the
other
was
a
maker
of
pretty
waxen
groups
the
one
was
utterly
unconscious
of
the
way
he
achieved
his
staggering
effects
the
other
was
the
most
toilsome
fastidious
and
of
craftsmen
what
remains
of
howells
is
his
style
he
invented
a
new
harmony
of
the
old
old
he
destroyed
the
stately
periods
of
the
poe
tradition
and
erected
upon
the
ruins
a
complex
and
savory
carelessness
full
of
naïvetés
that
were
sophisticated
to
the
last
degree
he
loosened
the
tightness
of
english
and
let
a
blast
of
elizabethan
air
into
it
he
achieved
for
all
his
triviality
for
all
his
narrowness
of
vision
a
pungent
and
admirable
style
professor
veblen
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
being
engaged
in
a
bombastic
discussion
with
what
was
then
known
as
an
intellectual
socialist
like
the
rest
of
the
he
succumbed
to
the
first
of
the
war
pulled
down
the
red
flag
damned
marx
as
a
german
spy
and
began
whooping
for
elihu
root
otto
kahn
and
abraham
lincoln
i
was
greatly
belabored
and
incommoded
by
his
long
quotations
from
a
certain
thorstein
veblen
then
quite
unknown
to
me
my
antagonist
manifestly
attached
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
these
borrowed
sagacities
for
he
often
heaved
them
at
me
in
lengths
of
a
column
or
two
and
urged
me
to
read
every
word
of
them
i
tried
hard
enough
but
found
it
impossible
going
the
more
i
read
them
in
fact
the
less
i
could
make
of
them
and
so
in
the
end
growing
impatient
and
impolite
i
denounced
this
veblen
as
a
geyser
of
pishposh
refused
to
waste
any
more
time
upon
his
incomprehensible
syllogisms
and
applied
myself
to
the
other
socialist
witnesses
in
the
case
seeking
to
set
fire
to
their
shirts
that
old
debate
which
took
place
by
mail
for
the
socialist
lived
like
a
munitions
patriot
on
his
country
estate
and
i
was
a
attached
to
a
city
newspaper
was
afterward
embalmed
in
a
dull
book
and
made
the
mild
pother
of
a
day
the
book
by
name
men
the
man
is
now
as
completely
forgotten
as
baxter
s
saint
s
rest
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
i
myself
perhaps
the
only
man
who
remembers
it
at
all
have
not
looked
into
it
for
six
or
eight
years
and
all
i
can
recall
of
my
opponent
s
argument
beyond
the
fact
that
it
not
only
failed
to
convert
me
to
the
nascent
bolshevism
of
the
time
but
left
me
a
bitter
and
incurable
scoffer
at
democracy
in
all
its
forms
is
his
curious
respect
for
the
aforesaid
thorstein
veblen
and
his
delight
in
the
learned
gentleman
s
long
tortuous
and
to
me
at
least
intolerably
flapdoodlish
phrases
there
was
indeed
a
time
when
i
forgot
even
my
mind
was
empty
of
the
professor
s
very
name
that
was
say
from
or
thereabout
to
the
middle
of
during
those
years
having
lost
all
my
old
superior
interest
in
socialism
even
as
an
amateur
psychiatrist
i
ceased
to
read
its
literature
and
thus
lost
track
of
its
great
thinkers
the
periodicals
that
i
then
gave
an
eye
to
setting
aside
newspapers
were
chiefly
the
familiar
american
imitations
of
the
english
weeklies
of
opinion
and
in
these
the
dominant
great
thinker
was
first
the
late
william
james
and
after
his
decease
john
dewey
the
reign
of
james
as
the
illuminated
will
recall
was
long
and
glorious
for
three
or
four
years
running
he
was
mentioned
in
every
one
of
those
american
and
at
least
once
a
week
and
often
a
dozen
times
among
the
less
somber
gazettes
of
the
republic
to
be
sure
there
were
other
heroes
maeterlinck
rabindranath
tagore
judge
ben
lindsey
the
late
roosevelt
tom
lawson
and
so
on
still
further
down
the
literary
and
intellectual
scale
there
were
yet
others
hall
caine
brieux
and
jack
johnson
among
them
with
cookery
and
the
twilight
sleep
to
dispute
their
popularity
but
on
the
majestic
level
of
the
old
among
the
white
and
lavender
peaks
of
professorial
ratiocination
there
was
scarcely
a
serious
rival
to
james
now
and
then
perhaps
jane
addams
had
a
month
of
vogue
and
during
one
winter
there
was
a
rage
for
bergson
and
for
a
short
space
the
unspeakable
bernstorff
tried
to
set
up
eucken
now
damned
with
wagner
nietzsche
and
ludendorff
but
taking
one
day
with
another
james
held
his
own
against
the
field
his
ideas
immediately
they
were
stated
became
the
ideas
of
every
pedagogue
from
harvard
to
leland
stanford
and
the
pedagogues
laboring
furiously
at
space
rates
rammed
them
into
the
skulls
of
the
lesser
to
have
called
james
an
ass
during
the
year
would
have
been
as
fatal
as
to
have
written
a
sentence
like
this
one
without
having
used
so
many
he
died
a
bit
later
but
his
ghost
went
marching
on
it
took
three
or
four
years
to
interpret
and
his
philosophical
remains
and
to
take
down
and
redact
his
messages
via
sir
oliver
lodge
little
brighteyes
the
indian
chief
and
other
gifted
psychics
from
the
spirit
world
but
then
gradually
he
achieved
the
ultimate
stupendous
and
irrevocable
act
of
death
and
there
was
a
vacancy
to
it
dewey
was
elected
by
the
acclamation
of
all
and
men
he
was
an
expert
in
pedagogics
metaphysics
psychology
ethics
logic
politics
pedagogical
metaphysics
metaphysical
psychology
psychological
ethics
ethical
logic
logical
politics
and
political
pedagogics
he
was
and
twice
he
had
written
a
book
called
how
to
he
sat
in
a
professor
s
chair
and
caned
sophomores
for
blowing
he
was
the
ideal
candidate
and
so
he
was
nominated
elected
and
inaugurated
and
for
three
years
more
or
less
he
enjoyed
a
peaceful
reign
in
the
groves
of
sapience
and
the
inferior
venerated
him
as
they
had
once
venerated
james
i
myself
greatly
enjoyed
and
profited
by
the
discourses
of
this
dewey
and
was
in
hopes
that
he
would
last
born
so
recently
as
and
a
man
of
the
highest
bearable
sobriety
he
seemed
likely
to
peg
along
until
or
a
gentle
and
charming
volcano
of
correct
thought
but
it
was
not
alas
to
be
under
cover
of
pragmatism
that
serpent
s
metaphysic
there
was
unrest
beneath
the
surface
young
professors
in
remote
and
obscure
universities
apparently
as
harmless
as
so
many
convicts
in
the
were
secretly
flirting
with
new
and
ideas
whole
regiments
and
brigades
of
them
yielded
in
stealthy
privacy
to
rebellious
and
often
incomprehensible
yearnings
now
and
then
as
if
to
reveal
what
was
brewing
a
hell
fire
blazed
and
a
scott
nearing
went
through
its
smoke
one
heard
whispers
of
strange
sociological
even
political
gossip
had
it
that
pedagogy
was
hatching
vipers
nay
was
already
brought
to
bed
but
not
much
of
this
got
into
the
and
yankee
hint
or
two
maybe
but
no
more
in
the
main
they
kept
to
their
old
resolute
demands
for
a
pure
the
budget
system
in
congress
the
abolition
of
hazing
at
the
naval
academy
an
honest
primary
and
justice
to
the
filipinos
with
extermination
of
the
prussian
serpent
added
after
august
and
dewey
on
his
remote
socratic
alp
pursued
the
calm
reënforcement
of
the
philosophical
principles
underlying
these
and
all
other
lofty
and
indignant
causes
then
of
a
sudden
siss
boom
ah
then
overnight
the
upspringing
of
the
intellectual
soviets
the
headlong
assault
upon
all
the
old
axioms
of
pedagogical
speculation
the
nihilistic
dethronement
of
rah
rah
rah
for
thorstein
veblen
veblen
could
it
aye
it
was
my
old
acquaintance
the
of
my
bout
with
the
intellectual
socialist
the
great
thinker
here
indeed
he
was
again
and
in
a
few
it
seemed
a
few
was
all
over
the
the
the
and
the
rest
of
them
and
his
books
and
pamphlets
began
to
pour
from
the
presses
and
the
newspapers
reported
his
every
wink
and
whisper
and
everybody
who
was
anybody
began
gabbling
about
him
the
spectacle
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
somewhat
disconcerted
me
and
even
distressed
me
on
the
one
hand
i
was
sorry
to
see
so
learned
and
interesting
a
man
as
dewey
sent
back
to
the
insufferable
dungeons
of
columbia
there
to
lecture
in
imperfect
yiddish
to
classes
of
grand
street
platos
and
on
the
other
hand
i
shrunk
supinely
from
the
appalling
job
newly
rearing
itself
before
me
of
the
whole
canon
of
the
singularly
laborious
and
muggy
the
incomparably
tangled
and
unintelligible
works
of
thorstein
veblen
but
if
a
sense
of
duty
tortures
a
man
it
also
enables
him
to
achieve
prodigies
and
so
i
managed
to
get
through
the
whole
infernal
job
i
read
the
theory
of
the
leisure
class
i
read
the
theory
of
business
enterprise
and
then
i
read
the
instinct
of
an
hiatus
followed
i
was
racked
by
a
severe
neuralgia
with
delusions
of
persecution
on
recovering
i
tackled
imperial
germany
and
the
industrial
malaria
for
a
month
and
then
the
nature
of
peace
and
the
terms
of
its
what
ensued
was
never
diagnosed
probably
it
was
some
low
infection
of
the
mesentery
or
spleen
when
it
passed
off
leaving
only
an
asthmatic
cough
i
read
the
higher
learning
in
america
and
then
went
to
mt
clemens
to
drink
the
glauber
s
salts
eureka
the
business
was
done
it
had
strained
me
but
now
it
was
over
alas
a
good
part
of
the
agony
had
been
needless
what
i
found
myself
aware
of
coming
to
the
end
was
that
practically
the
whole
system
of
veblen
was
in
his
first
book
and
his
is
in
the
theory
of
the
leisure
class
and
the
higher
learning
in
i
pass
on
the
good
news
read
these
two
and
you
won
t
have
to
read
the
others
and
if
even
two
daunt
you
then
read
the
first
once
through
it
though
you
will
have
missed
many
a
pearl
and
many
a
pain
you
will
have
a
fairly
good
general
acquaintance
with
the
gifted
metaphysician
s
ideas
for
those
ideas
in
the
main
are
quite
simple
and
often
anything
but
revolutionary
in
essence
what
is
genuinely
remarkable
about
them
is
not
their
novelty
or
their
complexity
nor
even
the
fact
that
a
professor
should
harbor
them
it
is
the
astoundingly
grandiose
and
rococo
manner
of
their
statement
the
almost
unbelievable
tediousness
and
flatulence
of
the
gifted
headmaster
s
prose
his
unprecedented
talent
for
saying
nothing
in
an
august
and
heroic
manner
there
are
tales
of
an
actress
of
the
last
generation
probably
sarah
bernhardt
who
could
put
pathos
and
even
terror
into
a
recitation
of
the
multiplication
table
the
late
louis
james
did
something
of
the
sort
he
introduced
limericks
into
peer
gynt
and
still
held
the
yokelry
agape
the
same
talent
raised
to
a
high
power
is
in
this
veblen
tunnel
under
his
great
moraines
and
stalagmites
of
words
dig
down
into
his
vast
of
discordant
and
raucous
polysyllables
blow
up
the
hard
thick
shell
of
his
almost
theological
manner
and
what
you
will
find
in
his
discourse
is
chiefly
a
mass
of
made
horrifying
the
obvious
in
terms
of
the
staggering
marx
i
daresay
said
a
good
deal
of
it
and
what
marx
overlooked
has
been
said
over
and
over
again
by
his
heirs
and
assigns
but
marx
at
this
business
labored
under
a
technical
handicap
he
wrote
in
german
a
language
he
actually
understood
veblen
submits
himself
to
no
such
disadvantage
though
born
i
believe
in
these
states
and
resident
here
all
his
life
he
achieves
the
effect
perhaps
without
employing
the
means
of
thinking
in
some
unearthly
foreign
swahili
sumerian
or
old
then
painfully
clawing
his
thoughts
into
a
copious
but
uncertain
and
english
the
result
is
a
style
that
affects
the
higher
cerebral
centers
like
a
constant
roll
of
subway
expresses
the
second
result
is
a
sort
of
bewildered
numbness
of
the
senses
as
before
some
fabulous
and
unearthly
marvel
and
the
third
result
if
i
make
no
mistake
is
the
celebrity
of
the
professor
as
a
great
thinker
in
brief
he
states
his
hollow
nothings
in
such
high
astounding
terms
that
they
must
inevitably
arrest
and
blister
the
mind
he
makes
them
mysterious
he
makes
them
shocking
he
makes
them
portentous
and
so
flinging
them
at
naïve
and
believing
minds
he
makes
them
stick
and
burn
no
doubt
you
think
that
i
even
that
i
lie
if
so
then
consider
this
first
paragraph
of
chapter
xiii
of
the
theory
of
the
leisure
class
in
an
increasing
proportion
as
time
goes
on
the
anthropomorphic
cult
with
its
code
of
devout
observances
suffers
a
progressive
disintegration
through
the
stress
of
economic
exigencies
and
the
decay
of
the
system
of
status
as
this
disintegration
proceeds
there
come
to
be
associated
and
blended
with
the
devout
attitude
certain
other
motives
and
impulses
that
are
not
always
of
an
anthropomorphic
origin
nor
traceable
to
the
habit
of
personal
subservience
not
all
of
these
subsidiary
impulses
that
blend
with
the
bait
of
devoutness
in
the
later
devotional
life
are
altogether
congruous
with
the
devout
attitude
or
with
the
anthropomorphic
apprehension
of
sequence
of
phenomena
their
origin
being
not
the
same
their
action
upon
the
scheme
of
devout
life
is
also
not
in
the
same
direction
in
many
ways
they
traverse
the
underlying
norm
of
subservience
or
vicarious
life
to
which
the
code
of
devout
observances
and
the
ecclesiastical
and
sacerdotal
institutions
are
to
be
traced
as
their
substantial
basis
through
the
presence
of
these
alien
motives
the
social
and
industrial
régime
of
status
gradually
disintegrates
and
the
canon
of
personal
subservience
loses
the
support
derived
from
an
unbroken
tradition
extraneous
habits
and
proclivities
encroach
upon
the
field
of
action
occupied
by
this
canon
and
it
presently
comes
about
that
the
ecclesiastical
and
sacerdotal
structures
are
partially
converted
to
other
uses
in
some
measure
alien
to
the
purposes
of
the
scheme
of
devout
life
as
it
stood
in
the
days
of
the
most
vigorous
and
characteristic
development
of
the
priesthood
well
what
have
we
here
what
does
this
appalling
salvo
of
rhetorical
artillery
signify
what
is
the
sweating
professor
trying
to
say
what
is
his
message
now
simply
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
worship
of
god
is
commonly
corrupted
by
other
enterprises
and
that
the
church
ceasing
to
be
a
mere
temple
of
adoration
becomes
the
headquarters
of
these
other
enterprises
more
simply
still
that
men
sometimes
vary
serving
god
by
serving
other
men
which
means
of
course
serving
themselves
this
bald
platitude
which
must
be
obvious
to
any
child
who
has
ever
been
to
a
church
bazaar
or
a
parish
house
is
here
tortured
worried
and
run
through
rollers
until
it
is
spread
out
to
words
of
which
fully
are
unnecessary
the
next
paragraph
is
even
worse
in
it
the
master
undertakes
to
explain
in
his
peculiar
dialect
the
meaning
of
that
sense
of
æsthetic
congruity
with
the
environment
which
is
left
as
a
residue
of
the
act
of
worship
after
elimination
of
its
anthropomorphic
just
what
does
he
mean
by
this
sense
of
æsthetic
congruity
i
have
studied
the
whole
paragraph
for
three
days
halting
only
for
prayer
and
sleep
and
i
have
come
to
certain
conclusions
i
may
be
wrong
but
nevertheless
it
is
the
best
that
i
can
do
what
i
conclude
is
this
he
is
trying
to
say
that
many
people
go
to
church
not
because
they
are
afraid
of
the
devil
but
because
they
enjoy
the
music
and
like
to
look
at
the
stained
glass
the
potted
lilies
and
the
rev
pastor
to
get
this
profound
and
highly
original
observation
upon
paper
he
wastes
not
merely
but
more
than
words
to
say
what
might
be
said
on
a
postage
stamp
he
takes
more
than
a
page
in
his
book
and
so
it
goes
alas
alas
in
all
his
other
cent
s
worth
of
information
wrapped
in
a
bale
of
polysyllables
in
the
higher
learning
in
america
the
thing
perhaps
reaches
its
damndest
and
worst
it
is
as
if
the
practice
of
that
incredibly
obscure
and
malodorous
style
were
a
relentless
disease
a
sort
of
progressive
intellectual
diabetes
a
leprosy
of
the
horse
sense
words
are
flung
upon
words
until
all
recollection
that
there
must
be
a
meaning
in
them
a
ground
and
excuse
for
them
is
lost
one
wanders
in
a
labyrinth
of
nouns
adjectives
verbs
pronouns
adverbs
prepositions
conjunctions
and
participles
most
of
them
swollen
and
nearly
all
of
them
unable
to
walk
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
worse
english
within
the
limits
of
intelligible
grammar
it
is
clumsy
affected
opaque
bombastic
windy
empty
it
is
without
grace
or
distinction
and
it
is
often
without
the
most
elementary
order
the
learned
professor
gets
himself
enmeshed
in
his
gnarled
sentences
like
a
bull
trapped
by
barbed
wire
and
his
efforts
to
extricate
himself
are
quite
as
furious
and
quite
as
spectacular
he
heaves
he
leaps
he
writhes
at
times
he
seems
to
be
at
the
point
of
yelling
for
the
police
it
is
a
picture
to
bemuse
the
vulgar
and
to
give
the
judicious
grief
worse
there
is
nothing
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
strident
ideas
it
is
designed
to
set
forth
are
in
the
overwhelming
main
poor
ideas
and
often
they
are
ideas
that
are
almost
idiotic
one
never
gets
the
thrill
of
sharp
and
original
thinking
dexterously
put
into
phrases
the
concepts
underlying
say
the
theory
of
the
leisure
class
are
simply
socialism
and
water
the
concepts
underlying
the
higher
learning
in
america
are
so
childishly
obvious
that
even
the
poor
drudges
who
write
editorials
for
newspapers
have
often
voiced
them
when
now
and
then
the
professor
tires
of
this
emission
of
stale
bosh
and
attempts
flights
of
a
more
original
character
he
straightway
comes
tumbling
down
into
absurdity
what
the
reader
then
has
to
struggle
with
is
not
only
intolerably
bad
writing
but
also
loose
flabby
cocksure
and
preposterous
thinking
again
i
take
refuge
in
an
example
it
is
from
chapter
iv
of
the
theory
of
the
leisure
the
problem
before
the
author
here
has
to
do
with
the
social
convention
which
frowns
upon
the
consumption
of
alcohol
by
least
to
the
extent
to
which
men
may
consume
it
decorously
well
then
what
is
his
explanation
of
this
convention
here
in
brief
is
his
process
of
reasoning
the
leisure
class
which
is
the
predatory
class
of
feudal
times
reserves
all
luxuries
for
itself
and
disapproves
their
use
by
members
of
the
lower
classes
for
this
use
takes
away
their
charm
by
taking
away
their
exclusive
possession
women
are
chattels
in
the
possession
of
the
leisure
class
and
hence
subject
to
the
rules
made
for
inferiors
the
patriarchal
tradition
says
that
the
woman
being
a
chattel
should
consume
only
what
is
necessary
to
her
sustenance
except
so
far
as
her
further
consumption
contributes
to
the
comfort
or
the
good
repute
of
her
the
consumption
of
alcohol
contributes
nothing
to
the
comfort
or
good
repute
of
the
woman
s
master
but
detracts
sensibly
from
the
comfort
or
pleasure
of
her
master
she
is
forbidden
to
drink
this
i
believe
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
veblenian
ratiocination
observe
it
well
for
it
is
typical
that
is
to
say
it
starts
off
with
a
gratuitous
and
highly
dubious
assumption
proceeds
to
an
equally
dubious
deduction
and
then
ends
with
a
platitude
which
begs
the
whole
question
what
sound
reason
is
there
for
believing
that
exclusive
possession
is
the
of
luxury
there
is
none
that
i
can
see
it
may
be
true
of
a
few
luxuries
but
it
is
certainly
not
true
of
the
most
familiar
ones
do
i
enjoy
a
decent
bath
because
i
know
that
john
smith
can
not
afford
because
i
delight
in
being
clean
do
i
admire
beethoven
s
fifth
symphony
because
it
is
incomprehensible
to
congressmen
and
because
i
genuinely
love
music
do
i
prefer
terrapin
à
la
maryland
to
fried
liver
because
must
put
up
with
the
because
the
terrapin
is
intrinsically
a
more
charming
dose
do
i
prefer
kissing
a
pretty
girl
to
kissing
a
charwoman
because
even
a
janitor
may
kiss
a
because
the
pretty
girl
looks
better
smells
better
and
kisses
better
now
and
then
to
be
sure
the
idea
of
exclusive
possession
enters
into
the
concept
of
luxury
i
may
if
i
am
a
bibliophile
esteem
a
book
because
it
is
a
unique
first
edition
i
may
if
i
am
fond
esteem
a
woman
because
she
smiles
on
no
one
else
but
even
here
save
in
a
very
small
minority
of
cases
other
attractions
plainly
enter
into
the
matter
it
pleases
me
to
have
a
unique
first
edition
but
i
wouldn
t
care
anything
for
a
unique
first
edition
of
robert
chambers
or
elinor
glyn
the
author
must
have
my
respect
the
book
must
be
intrinsically
valuable
there
must
be
much
more
to
it
than
its
mere
uniqueness
and
if
being
fond
i
glory
in
the
exclusive
smiles
of
a
certain
miss
or
then
surely
my
satisfaction
depends
chiefly
upon
the
lady
herself
and
not
upon
my
mere
monopoly
would
i
delight
in
the
fidelity
of
the
charwoman
would
it
give
me
any
joy
to
learn
that
through
a
sense
of
duty
to
me
she
had
ceased
to
kiss
the
janitor
confronted
by
such
considerations
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
little
truth
left
in
veblen
s
theory
of
conspicuous
consumption
and
conspicuous
what
remains
of
it
after
it
is
practically
applied
a
few
times
is
no
more
than
a
wraith
of
balderdash
in
so
far
as
it
is
true
it
is
obvious
all
the
professor
accomplishes
with
it
is
to
take
what
every
one
knows
and
pump
it
up
to
such
proportions
that
every
one
begins
to
doubt
it
what
could
be
plainer
than
his
failure
in
the
case
just
cited
he
starts
off
with
a
platitude
and
ends
in
absurdity
no
one
denies
i
take
it
that
in
a
clearly
limited
sense
women
occupy
a
place
in
the
more
accurately
aspire
to
a
place
in
the
is
a
good
deal
like
that
of
a
chattel
marriage
the
goal
of
their
only
honest
and
permanent
hopes
invades
their
individuality
a
married
woman
becomes
the
function
of
another
individuality
thus
the
appearance
she
presents
to
the
world
is
often
the
mirror
of
her
husband
s
egoism
a
rich
man
hangs
his
wife
with
expensive
clothes
and
jewels
for
the
same
reason
among
others
that
he
adorns
his
own
head
with
a
plug
hat
to
notify
everybody
that
he
can
afford
brief
to
excite
the
envy
of
socialists
but
he
also
does
it
let
us
hope
for
another
and
far
better
and
more
powerful
reason
to
wit
that
she
intrigues
him
that
he
delights
in
her
that
he
loves
so
wants
to
make
her
gaudy
and
happy
this
reason
may
not
appeal
to
socialist
sociologists
in
russia
according
to
an
old
scandal
officially
endorsed
by
the
british
bureau
for
pulling
yankee
noses
the
bolsheviki
actually
repudiated
it
as
insane
nevertheless
it
continues
to
appeal
very
forcibly
to
the
majority
of
normal
husbands
in
the
nations
of
the
west
and
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
a
hundred
times
as
potent
as
any
other
reason
the
american
husband
in
particular
dresses
his
wife
like
a
circus
horse
not
primarily
because
he
wants
to
display
his
wealth
upon
her
person
but
because
he
is
a
soft
and
moony
fellow
and
ever
ready
to
yield
to
her
desires
however
preposterous
if
any
conception
of
her
as
a
chattel
were
actively
in
him
even
unconsciously
he
would
be
a
good
deal
less
her
slave
as
it
is
her
vicarious
practice
of
conspicuous
waste
commonly
reaches
such
a
development
that
her
master
himself
is
forced
into
brings
veblen
s
theory
to
his
final
conclusion
is
as
unsound
as
his
premisses
all
it
comes
to
is
a
plain
begging
of
the
question
why
does
a
man
forbid
his
wife
to
drink
all
the
alcohol
she
can
hold
because
he
says
it
detracts
sensibly
from
his
comfort
or
in
other
words
it
detracts
from
his
comfort
and
pleasure
because
it
detracts
from
his
comfort
and
pleasure
meanwhile
the
real
answer
is
so
plain
that
even
a
professor
should
know
it
a
man
forbids
his
wife
to
drink
too
much
because
deep
in
his
secret
archives
he
has
records
of
the
behavior
of
other
women
who
drank
too
much
and
is
eager
to
safeguard
his
wife
s
and
his
own
dignity
against
what
he
knows
to
be
certain
invasion
in
brief
it
is
a
commonplace
of
observation
familiar
to
all
males
beyond
the
age
of
that
once
a
woman
is
drunk
the
rest
is
a
mere
matter
of
time
and
place
the
girl
is
already
there
a
husband
viewing
this
prospect
perhaps
shrinks
from
having
his
chattel
damaged
but
let
us
be
soft
enough
to
think
that
he
may
also
shrink
from
seeing
humiliation
ridicule
and
bitter
regret
inflicted
upon
one
who
is
under
his
protection
and
one
whose
dignity
and
happiness
are
precious
to
him
and
one
whom
he
regards
with
deep
and
i
surely
hope
lasting
affection
a
man
s
grandfather
is
surely
not
his
chattel
even
by
the
terms
of
the
veblen
theory
and
yet
i
am
sure
that
no
sane
man
would
let
the
old
gentleman
go
beyond
a
discreet
cocktail
or
two
if
a
bout
of
genuine
bibbing
were
certain
to
be
followed
by
the
complete
destruction
of
his
dignity
his
chastity
and
if
a
presbyterian
his
immortal
soul
one
more
example
of
the
veblenian
logic
and
i
must
pass
on
i
have
other
fish
to
fry
on
page
of
the
theory
of
the
leisure
class
he
turns
his
garish
and
buzzing
upon
another
problem
of
the
domestic
hearth
this
time
a
double
one
first
why
do
we
have
lawns
around
our
country
houses
secondly
why
don
t
we
employ
cows
to
keep
them
clipped
instead
of
importing
italians
croatians
and
blackamoors
the
first
question
is
answered
by
an
appeal
to
ethnology
we
delight
in
lawns
because
we
are
the
descendants
of
a
pastoral
people
inhabiting
a
region
with
a
humid
true
enough
there
is
in
a
lawn
an
element
of
sensuous
beauty
but
that
is
secondary
the
main
thing
is
that
our
ancestors
had
flocks
and
thus
took
a
keen
professional
interest
in
grass
the
marx
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
in
e
flat
but
why
don
t
keep
flocks
why
do
we
renounce
cows
and
hire
because
to
the
average
popular
apprehension
a
herd
of
cattle
so
pointedly
suggests
thrift
and
usefulness
that
their
presence
would
be
intolerably
with
the
highest
veneration
bosh
plowing
through
a
bad
book
from
end
to
end
i
can
find
nothing
sillier
than
this
here
indeed
the
whole
theory
of
conspicuous
waste
is
exposed
for
precisely
what
it
is
one
per
cent
platitude
and
per
cent
nonsense
has
the
genial
professor
pondering
his
great
problems
ever
taken
a
walk
in
the
country
and
has
he
in
the
course
of
that
walk
ever
crossed
a
pasture
inhabited
by
a
cow
and
has
he
making
that
crossing
ever
passed
astern
of
the
cow
herself
and
has
he
thus
passing
astern
ever
stepped
carelessly
but
this
is
not
a
medical
work
and
so
i
had
better
haul
up
the
cow
to
me
symbolizes
the
whole
speculation
of
this
laborious
and
humorless
pedagogue
from
end
to
end
you
will
find
the
same
tedious
torturing
of
plain
facts
the
same
relentless
piling
up
of
thin
and
theory
the
same
flatulent
bombast
the
same
intellectual
strabismus
and
always
with
an
air
of
vast
importance
always
in
vexed
and
formidable
sentences
always
in
the
longest
words
possible
always
in
the
most
cacophonous
english
that
even
a
professor
ever
wrote
one
visualizes
him
with
his
head
thrown
back
searching
for
cryptic
answers
in
the
firmament
and
not
seeing
the
overt
and
disconcerting
cow
not
watching
his
step
one
sees
him
as
the
pundit
infinitely
earnest
and
diligent
infinitely
honest
and
patient
but
also
infinitely
humorless
futile
and
hollow
so
much
at
least
for
the
present
for
this
thorstein
veblen
head
great
thinker
to
the
parlor
radicals
socrates
of
the
intellectual
greenwich
village
chief
star
at
least
transiently
of
the
american
i
am
tempted
to
crowd
in
mention
of
some
of
his
other
astounding
example
the
theory
that
the
presence
of
pupils
the
labor
of
teaching
a
concern
with
pedagogy
is
necessary
to
the
highest
functioning
of
a
scientific
notion
magnificently
supported
by
the
examples
of
flexner
ehrlich
metchnikoff
loeb
and
carrel
i
am
tempted
too
to
devote
a
thirdly
to
the
astounding
materialism
almost
the
downright
hoggishness
of
his
whole
absolute
exclusion
of
everything
approaching
an
æsthetic
motive
but
i
must
leave
all
these
fallacies
and
absurdities
to
your
own
inquiry
more
important
than
any
of
them
more
important
as
a
phenomenon
than
the
professor
himself
and
all
his
works
is
the
gravity
with
which
his
muddled
and
highly
dubious
ideas
have
been
received
at
the
moment
i
daresay
he
is
in
decline
such
great
thinkers
have
a
way
of
going
out
as
quickly
as
they
come
in
but
a
year
or
so
ago
he
dominated
the
american
scene
all
the
reviews
were
full
of
his
ideas
a
hundred
lesser
sages
reflected
them
every
one
of
intellectual
pretentions
read
his
books
veblenism
was
shining
in
full
brilliance
there
were
veblenists
veblen
clubs
veblen
remedies
for
all
the
sorrows
of
the
world
there
were
even
in
chicago
veblen
gibson
girls
grown
and
despairing
the
spectacle
unluckily
was
not
novel
go
back
through
the
history
of
america
since
the
early
nineties
and
you
will
find
a
long
succession
of
just
such
violent
and
uncritical
enthusiasms
james
had
his
day
dewey
had
his
day
ibsen
had
his
day
maeterlinck
had
his
day
almost
every
year
sees
another
intellectual
munyon
arise
with
his
infallible
peruna
for
all
the
current
malaises
sometimes
this
great
thinker
is
imported
once
he
was
pastor
wagner
once
he
was
bergson
once
he
was
eucken
once
he
was
tolstoi
once
he
was
a
lady
by
name
ellen
key
again
he
was
another
lady
signorina
montessori
but
more
often
he
is
of
native
growth
and
full
of
the
pervasive
cocksureness
and
superficiality
of
the
land
i
do
not
rank
veblen
among
the
worst
of
these
haruspices
save
perhaps
as
a
stylist
i
am
actually
convinced
that
he
belongs
among
the
best
of
them
but
that
best
is
surely
depressing
enough
what
lies
behind
it
is
the
besetting
intellectual
sin
of
the
united
habit
of
turning
intellectual
concepts
into
emotional
concepts
the
vice
of
orgiastic
and
inflammatory
thinking
there
is
in
america
no
orderly
and
thorough
working
out
of
the
fundamental
problems
of
our
society
there
is
only
as
one
englishman
has
said
an
eternal
combat
of
crazes
the
things
of
capital
importance
are
habitually
discussed
not
by
men
soberly
trying
to
get
at
the
truth
about
them
but
by
brummagem
great
thinkers
trying
only
to
get
out
of
them
we
are
beset
endlessly
by
they
are
not
the
less
quacks
when
they
happen
to
be
quite
honest
in
all
fields
from
politics
to
pedagogics
and
from
theology
to
public
hygiene
there
is
a
constant
emotional
obscuration
of
the
true
issues
a
violent
combat
of
credulities
an
inane
debasement
of
scientific
curiosity
to
the
level
of
mob
gaping
the
thing
to
blame
of
course
is
our
lack
of
an
intellectual
in
its
information
skeptical
in
its
habit
of
mind
and
above
all
secure
in
its
position
and
authority
every
other
civilized
country
has
such
an
aristocracy
it
is
the
natural
corrective
of
enthusiasms
from
below
it
is
hospitable
to
ideas
but
as
adamant
against
crazes
it
stands
against
the
pollution
of
logic
by
emotion
the
sophistication
of
evidence
to
the
glory
of
god
but
in
america
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
more
powerful
here
more
capable
of
putting
its
idiotic
ideas
into
execution
than
anywhere
surely
more
eager
to
follow
platitudinous
messiahs
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
ruling
hostile
to
inquiry
tyrannical
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
suspicious
of
ideas
of
whatever
sort
in
the
middle
ground
there
is
little
save
an
indistinct
herd
of
intellectual
eunuchs
chiefly
quite
as
stupid
as
the
plutocracy
and
always
in
great
fear
of
it
when
it
produces
a
stray
rebel
he
goes
over
to
the
mob
there
is
no
place
for
him
within
his
own
order
this
feeble
and
vacillating
class
unorganized
and
without
authority
is
responsible
for
what
passes
as
the
opinion
of
the
the
sort
of
opinion
that
one
encounters
in
the
serious
what
later
on
leaks
down
much
diluted
into
the
few
newspapers
that
are
not
frankly
imbecile
veblen
has
himself
described
it
in
the
higher
learning
in
america
he
is
one
of
its
characteristic
products
and
he
proves
that
he
is
thoroughly
of
it
by
the
timorousness
he
shows
in
that
book
it
is
in
the
main
only
it
lacks
experience
of
the
world
assurance
the
consciousness
of
class
solidarity
and
security
of
no
definite
position
in
our
national
life
exposed
alike
to
the
clamors
of
the
mob
and
the
discipline
of
the
plutocracy
it
gets
no
public
respect
and
is
deficient
in
thus
the
better
sort
of
men
are
not
tempted
to
enter
it
it
recruits
only
men
of
feeble
courage
men
of
small
originality
its
sublimest
flower
is
the
american
college
president
well
described
by
perambulating
sycophant
and
platitudinarian
a
gaudy
mendicant
and
bounder
engaged
all
his
life
not
in
the
battle
of
ideas
the
pursuit
and
dissemination
of
knowledge
but
in
the
courting
of
rich
donkeys
and
the
entertainment
of
mobs
nay
veblen
is
not
the
worst
veblen
is
almost
the
best
the
worst
i
begin
to
grow
indignant
and
indignation
as
old
friedrich
used
to
say
is
foreign
to
my
nature
vi
the
new
poetry
movement
the
current
pother
about
poetry
now
gradually
subsiding
seems
to
have
begun
about
seven
years
in
it
was
during
that
year
that
harriet
monroe
established
a
magazine
of
in
chicago
and
ever
since
then
she
has
been
the
mother
superior
of
the
movement
other
leaders
have
occasionally
disputed
her
bombastic
braithwaite
with
his
annual
anthology
of
magazine
verse
amy
lowell
with
her
solemn
pronunciamentos
in
the
manner
of
a
harvard
professor
vachel
lindsay
with
his
nebulous
vaporings
and
chautauqua
posturings
even
such
cheap
jacks
as
alfred
kreymborg
out
of
greenwich
village
but
the
importance
of
miss
monroe
grows
more
manifest
as
year
chases
year
she
was
to
begin
with
clearly
the
pioneer
was
on
the
stands
nearly
two
years
before
the
first
braithwaite
anthology
and
long
before
miss
lowell
had
been
lured
from
her
earlier
doggerels
by
the
imagists
it
antedated
too
all
the
other
salient
documents
of
the
s
spoon
river
anthology
frost
s
north
of
boston
lindsay
s
general
william
booth
enters
heaven
the
historic
bulls
of
the
imagists
the
frantic
balderdash
of
the
others
group
moreover
miss
monroe
has
always
managed
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
all
wings
of
the
host
and
has
thus
managed
to
exert
a
ponderable
influence
both
to
starboard
and
to
port
this
i
daresay
is
because
she
is
a
very
intelligent
woman
which
fact
is
alone
sufficient
to
give
her
an
austere
eminence
in
a
movement
so
beset
by
mountebanks
and
their
dupes
i
have
read
since
the
first
number
and
find
it
constantly
entertaining
it
has
printed
a
great
deal
of
extravagant
stuff
and
not
a
little
downright
nonsensical
stuff
but
in
the
main
it
has
steered
a
safe
and
intelligible
course
with
no
salient
blunders
no
other
poetry
there
have
been
dozens
of
even
remotely
approached
it
in
interest
or
for
that
matter
in
genuine
hospitality
to
ideas
practically
all
of
the
others
have
been
operated
by
passionate
enthusiasts
often
extremely
ignorant
and
always
narrow
and
humorless
but
miss
monroe
has
managed
to
retain
a
certain
judicial
calm
in
the
midst
of
all
the
whooping
and
and
so
she
has
avoided
running
amuck
and
her
magazine
has
printed
the
very
best
of
the
new
poetry
and
avoided
much
of
the
worst
as
i
say
the
movement
shows
signs
of
having
spent
its
strength
the
mere
bulk
of
the
verse
that
it
produces
is
a
great
deal
less
than
it
was
three
or
four
years
ago
or
even
one
or
two
years
ago
and
there
is
a
noticeable
tendency
toward
the
conservatism
once
so
loftily
disdained
i
daresay
the
burlesque
of
witter
bynner
and
arthur
davison
ficke
was
a
hard
blow
to
the
more
fantastic
radicals
at
all
events
they
subsided
after
it
was
perpetrated
and
for
a
couple
of
years
nothing
has
been
heard
from
them
these
radicals
chiefly
collected
in
what
was
called
the
others
group
rattled
the
slapstick
in
a
sort
of
to
the
main
exhibition
they
attracted
of
course
all
the
more
credulous
and
uninformed
partisans
of
the
movement
and
not
a
few
advanced
professors
out
of
universities
began
to
lecture
upon
them
before
bucolic
women
s
clubs
they
committed
in
the
end
by
beginning
to
believe
in
their
own
buncombe
when
their
leaders
took
to
the
chautauquas
and
sought
to
convince
the
peasantry
that
james
whitcomb
riley
was
a
fraud
the
time
was
ripe
for
the
lethal
buffoonery
of
mm
bynner
and
ficke
that
buffoonery
was
enormously
the
best
hoax
in
american
literary
history
it
was
swallowed
indeed
by
so
many
magnificoes
that
it
made
criticism
very
timorous
thereafter
and
so
did
damage
to
not
a
few
quite
honest
bards
a
new
poet
if
he
departs
ever
so
little
from
the
path
already
beaten
is
kept
in
a
sort
of
literary
delousing
pen
until
it
is
established
that
he
is
genuinely
sincere
and
not
merely
another
bynner
in
hempen
whiskers
and
a
cloak
to
go
invisible
well
what
is
the
net
produce
of
the
whole
uproar
how
much
actual
poetry
have
all
these
truculent
rebels
against
stedman
s
anthology
and
mcguffey
s
sixth
reader
manufactured
i
suppose
i
have
read
nearly
all
of
great
deal
of
it
as
a
magazine
editor
in
yet
as
i
look
back
my
memory
is
lighted
up
by
very
few
flashes
of
any
lasting
brilliance
the
best
of
all
the
lutists
of
the
new
school
i
am
inclined
to
think
are
carl
sandburg
and
james
oppenheim
and
particularly
sandburg
he
shows
a
great
deal
of
raucous
crudity
he
is
often
a
bit
uncertain
and
wobbly
and
sometimes
he
is
downright
taking
one
bard
with
another
he
is
probably
the
soundest
and
most
intriguing
of
the
lot
compare
for
example
his
war
eloquent
and
extraordinarily
the
humorless
balderdash
of
amy
lowell
or
to
go
outside
the
movement
to
the
childish
gush
of
joyce
kilmer
hermann
hagedorn
and
charles
hanson
towne
often
he
gets
memorable
effects
by
astonishingly
austere
means
as
in
his
famous
chicago
rhapsody
and
his
cool
and
always
he
is
thoroughly
individual
a
true
original
his
own
man
oppenheim
equally
eloquent
is
more
conventional
he
stands
as
to
one
leg
on
the
shoulders
of
walt
whitman
and
as
to
the
other
on
a
stack
of
old
testaments
the
stuff
he
writes
despite
his
belief
to
the
contrary
is
not
american
at
all
it
is
absolutely
jewish
levantine
almost
asiatic
but
here
is
something
criticism
too
often
forgets
the
jew
intrinsically
is
the
greatest
of
poets
beside
his
gorgeous
rhapsodies
the
highest
flights
of
any
western
bard
seem
feeble
and
cerebral
oppenheim
inhabiting
a
brick
house
in
new
york
manages
to
get
that
sonorous
eastern
note
into
his
dithyrambs
they
are
often
inchoate
and
feverish
but
at
their
best
they
have
the
gigantic
gusto
of
solomon
s
song
miss
lowell
is
the
schoolmarm
of
the
movement
and
vastly
more
the
pedagogue
than
the
artist
she
has
written
perhaps
half
a
dozen
excellent
pieces
in
imitation
of
richard
aldington
and
john
gould
fletcher
and
a
great
deal
of
highfalutin
bathos
her
a
dome
of
glass
is
full
of
infantile
poppycock
and
though
it
is
true
that
it
was
first
printed
in
before
she
joined
the
imagists
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
it
was
reprinted
with
her
consent
in
after
she
had
definitely
set
up
shop
as
a
foe
of
the
her
celebrity
i
fancy
is
largely
if
she
were
miss
tilly
jones
of
fort
smith
there
would
be
a
great
deal
less
rowing
about
her
and
her
successive
masterpieces
would
be
received
less
gravely
a
literary
craftsman
in
america
as
i
have
already
said
once
or
twice
is
never
judged
by
his
work
alone
miss
lowell
has
been
helped
very
much
by
her
excellent
social
position
the
majority
and
perhaps
fully
of
the
revolutionary
poets
are
of
no
social
position
at
reporters
jews
foreigners
of
vague
nationality
school
teachers
lawyers
advertisement
writers
itinerant
lecturers
greenwich
village
posturers
and
so
on
i
have
a
suspicion
that
it
has
subtly
flattered
such
denizens
of
the
to
find
the
sister
of
a
president
of
harvard
in
their
midst
and
that
their
delight
has
materially
corrupted
their
faculties
miss
lowell
s
book
of
exposition
tendencies
in
modern
american
poetry
is
commonplace
to
the
last
degree
louis
untermeyer
s
the
new
era
in
american
poetry
is
very
much
better
and
so
is
john
livingston
lowes
convention
and
revolt
in
as
for
edgar
lee
masters
for
a
short
season
the
undisputed
homer
of
the
movement
i
believe
that
he
is
already
extinct
what
made
the
fame
of
the
spoon
river
anthology
was
not
chiefly
any
great
show
of
novelty
in
it
nor
any
extraordinary
poignancy
nor
any
grim
truthfulness
unparalleled
but
simply
the
public
notion
that
it
was
improper
it
fell
upon
the
country
at
the
height
of
the
last
sex
wave
eternally
ebbing
and
flowing
now
high
now
low
it
was
read
not
as
work
of
art
but
as
document
its
large
circulation
was
undoubtedly
mainly
among
persons
to
whom
poetry
poetry
was
as
sour
a
dose
as
symphonic
music
to
such
persons
of
course
it
seemed
something
new
under
the
sun
they
were
unacquainted
with
the
verse
of
george
crabbe
they
were
quite
innocent
of
robinson
and
robert
frost
they
knew
nothing
of
the
formula
they
had
never
heard
of
the
greek
anthology
the
roar
of
his
popular
success
won
masters
case
with
the
critics
his
undoubted
merits
in
cynicism
his
capacity
for
evoking
simple
emotions
his
deft
skill
at
managing
the
puny
difficulties
of
thereupon
pumped
up
to
such
an
extent
that
his
defects
were
lost
sight
of
those
defects
however
shine
blindingly
in
his
later
books
without
the
advantage
of
content
that
went
with
the
anthology
they
reveal
themselves
as
volumes
of
empty
doggerel
with
now
and
then
a
brief
moment
of
illumination
it
would
be
difficult
indeed

bad

lindsay
alas
he
has
done
his
own
burlesque
what
was
new
in
him
at
the
start
was
an
echo
of
the
barbaric
rhythms
of
the
jubilee
songs
but
very
soon
the
thing
ceased
to
be
a
marvel
and
of
late
his
elephantine
college
yells
have
ceased
to
be
amusing
his
retirement
to
the
chautauquas
is
of
uncommon
penetration
frost

of
sour
resignationism
for
sweet
resignationism

robinson
ditto
but
with
a
politer
bow
he
has
written
sound
poetry
but
not
much
of
it
the
late
roosevelt
ruined
him
by
praising
him
as
he
ruined

headlong
flight

the

east
pound
it
seems
to
me
is
the
most
picturesque
man
in
the
whole
professor
turned
fantee
abelard
in
grand
opera
his
knowledge
is
abysmal
he
has
it
readily
on
tap
moreover
he
has
a
fine
ear
and
has
written
many
an
excellent
verse
but
now
all
the
glow
and
gusto
of
the
bard
have
been
transformed
into
the
rage
of
the
pamphleteer
he
drops
the
lute
for
the
bayonet
one
sympathizes
with
him
in
his
choler
the
stupidity
he
combats
is
actually
almost
unbearable
every
normal
man
must
be
tempted
at
times
to
spit
on
his
hands
hoist
the
black
flag
and
begin
slitting
throats
but
this
business
alas
is
fatal
to
the
placid
moods
and
fine
of
the
poet
pound
gives
a
thrilling
show
the
remaining
stars
of
the
liberation
need
not
detain
us
they
are
the
following
the
calliope
they
have
labored
with
diligence
but
they
have
produced
no
poetry
miss
monroe
if
she
would
write
a
book
about
it
would
be
the
most
competent
historian
of
the
movement
and
perhaps
also
its
keenest
critic
she
has
seen
it
from
the
inside
she
knows
precisely
what
it
is
about
she
is
able
finally
to
detach
herself
from
its
extravagances
and
to
estimate
its
opponents
without
bile
her
failure
to
do
a
volume
about
it
leaves
untermeyer
s
the
new
era
in
american
poetry
the
best
in
the
field
lowes
treatise
is
very
much
more
thorough
but
it
has
the
defect
of
stopping
with
the
has
too
little
to
say
about
specific
poets
untermeyer
discusses
all
of
them
and
then
throws
in
a
dozen
or
two
orthodox
bards
wholly
untouched
by
bolshevism
for
good
measure
his
criticism
is
often
trenchant
and
always
very
clear
he
thinks
he
knows
what
he
thinks
he
knows
and
he
states
it
with
the
utmost
indeed
as
in
the
case
of
pound
with
a
good
deal
more
address
than
its
essential
accuracy
deserves
but
the
messianic
note
that
gets
into
the
bulls
and
ukases
of
pound
himself
the
profound
solemnity
of
miss
lowell
the
windy
nothings
of
lindsay
the
contradictions
of
the
imagists
the
puerilities
of
kreymborg
these
things
are
happily
absent
and
so
it
is
possible
to
follow
him
amiably
even
when
he
is
palpably
wrong
that
is
not
seldom
at
the
very
start
for
example
he
permits
himself
a
lot
of
highly
dubious
about
the
inherent
americanism
and
soaring
democracy
of
the
movement
once
he
says
the
most
exclusive
and
aristocratic
of
the
arts
appreciated
and
fostered
only
by
little
and
erudite
groups
poetry
has
suddenly
swung
away
from
its
strictures
and
is
expressing
itself
once
more
in
terms
of
pondering
excessively
i
can
think
of
nothing
that
would
be
more
untrue
than
this
the
fact
is
that
the
new
poetry
is
neither
american
nor
democratic
despite
its
remote
grounding
on
whitman
it
started
not
in
the
united
states
at
all
but
in
france
and
its
exotic
color
is
still
its
most
salient
characteristic
practically
every
one
of
its
practitioners
is
palpably
under
some
strong
foreign
influence
and
most
of
them
are
no
more
than
a
samovar
or
a
toccata
the
deliberate
strangeness
of
pound
his
almost
fanatical
is
a
mere
accentuation
of
what
is
in
every
other
member
of
the
fraternity
many
of
them
like
frost
fletcher
and
pound
have
exiled
themselves
from
the
republic
others
such
as
oppenheim
sandburg
giovannitti
benét
and
untermeyer
himself
are
palpably
continental
europeans
often
with
levantine
traces
yet
others
such
as
miss
lowell
and
masters
are
little
more
at
their
best
than
translators
and
the
french
from
the
japanese
from
the
greek
even
lindsay
superficially
the
most
national
of
them
all
has
also
his
exotic
smear
as
i
have
shown
let
miss
lowell
herself
be
a
witness
we
shall
see
them
she
says
at
the
opening
of
her
essay
on
robinson
ceding
more
and
more
to
the
influence
of
other
alien
peoples
a
glance
is
sufficient
to
show
the
correctness
of
this
observation
there
is
no
more
inherent
americanism
in
the
new
poetry
than
there
is
in
the
new
american
painting
and
music
it
lies
in
fact
quite
outside
the
main
stream
of
american
culture
nor
is
it
democratic
in
any
intelligible
sense
the
poetry
of
whittier
and
longfellow
was
democratic
it
voiced
the
elemental
emotions
of
the
masses
of
the
people
it
was
full
of
their
simple
ideas
they
comprehended
it
and
cherished
it
and
so
with
the
poetry
of
james
whitcomb
riley
and
with
that
of
walt
mason
and
ella
wheeler
wilcox
but
the
new
poetry
grounded
firmly
upon
novelty
of
form
and
boldness
of
idea
is
quite
beyond
their
understanding
it
seems
to
them
to
be
idiotic
just
as
the
poetry
of
whitman
seemed
to
them
to
be
idiotic
and
if
they
could
summon
up
enough
interest
in
it
to
examine
it
at
length
they
would
undoubtedly
clamor
for
laws
making
the
confection
of
it
a
felony
the
mistake
of
untermeyer
and
of
others
who
talk
to
the
same
effect
lies
in
confusing
the
beliefs
of
poets
and
the
subject
matter
of
their
verse
with
its
position
in
the
national
consciousness
oppenheim
sandburg
and
lindsay
are
democrats
just
as
whitman
was
a
democrat
but
their
poetry
is
no
more
a
democratic
phenomenon
than
his
was
or
than
to
go
to
music
beethoven
s
eroica
symphony
was
many
of
the
new
poets
in
truth
are
ardent
enemies
of
democracy
for
example
pound
only
one
of
them
has
ever
actually
sought
to
take
his
strophes
to
the
vulgar
that
one
is
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
yokels
welcomed
him
not
because
they
were
interested
in
his
poetry
but
because
it
struck
them
as
an
amazing
and
perhaps
even
a
fascinatingly
obscene
thing
for
a
sane
man
to
go
about
the
country
on
any
such
bizarre
and
undemocratic
business
no
sound
art
in
fact
could
possibly
be
democratic
tolstoi
wrote
a
whole
book
to
prove
the
contrary
and
only
succeeded
in
making
his
case
absurd
the
only
art
that
is
capable
of
reaching
the
is
art
that
is
already
debased
and
music
official
sculpture
pears
soap
painting
the
popular
novel
what
is
honest
and
worthy
of
praise
in
the
new
poetry
is
greek
to
the
general
and
despite
much
nonsense
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
little
in
it
that
is
honest
and
worthy
of
praise
it
has
for
one
thing
made
an
effective
war
upon
the
and
so
purged
the
verse
of
the
nation
of
much
of
its
old
banality
in
subject
and
phrase
the
elegant
album
pieces
of
richard
henry
stoddard
and
edmund
clarence
stedman
are
no
longer
in
perhaps
among
the
democrats
that
untermeyer
mentions
and
in
the
second
place
it
has
substituted
for
this
ancient
conventionality
an
eager
curiosity
in
life
as
men
and
women
are
actually
living
spirit
of
daring
experimentation
that
has
made
poetry
vivid
and
full
of
human
interest
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
elizabeth
the
thing
often
passes
into
the
grotesque
it
is
shot
through
and
through
with
but
at
its
high
points
it
has
achieved
invaluable
pioneering
a
new
poet
emerging
out
of
the
baptist
night
of
peoria
or
little
rock
comes
into
an
atmosphere
charged
with
subtle
electricities
there
is
a
stimulating
restlessness
ideas
have
a
welcome
the
art
he
aspires
to
is
no
longer
a
merely
formal
exercise
like
practicing
czerny
when
a
henry
van
dyke
arises
at
some
college
banquet
and
begins
to
discharge
an
ode
to
there
is
a
definite
snicker
it
is
almost
as
if
he
were
to
appear
in
congress
gaiters
or
a
beaver
hat
an
audience
for
such
things
of
course
still
exists
it
is
no
doubt
an
enormously
large
audience
but
it
has
changed
a
good
deal
qualitatively
if
not
quantitatively
the
relatively
civilized
reader
has
been
educated
to
something
better
he
has
heard
a
music
that
has
spoiled
his
ear
for
the
old
wheezing
of
the
melodeon
he
weeps
no
more
over
what
wrung
him
yesteryear
unluckily
the
new
movement
in
america
even
more
than
in
england
france
and
germany
suffers
from
a
very
crippling
lack
and
that
is
the
lack
of
a
genuinely
poet
it
has
produced
many
talents
but
it
has
yet
to
produce
any
genius
or
even
the
shadow
of
genius
there
has
been
a
general
lifting
of
the
plain
but
no
vasty
and
melodramatic
throwing
up
of
new
peaks
worse
still
it
has
had
to
face
hard
competition
from
is
from
poets
who
while
also
emerged
from
platitude
have
yet
stood
outside
it
and
perhaps
in
some
doubt
of
it
untermeyer
discusses
a
number
of
such
poets
in
his
book
there
is
one
of
them
lizette
woodworth
reese
who
has
written
more
sound
poetry
more
genuinely
eloquent
and
beautiful
poetry
than
all
the
new
poets
put
than
a
whole
posse
of
masterses
and
lindsays
more
than
a
hundred
amy
lowells
and
there
are
others
neihardt
and
john
mcclure
among
mcclure
untermeyer
usually
anything
but
an
ass
once
committed
the
unforgettable
asininity
of
sneering
at
mcclure
the
blunder
i
daresay
is
already
lamented
it
is
not
embalmed
in
his
book
but
it
will
haunt
him
on
tyburn
hill
for
this
mcclure
attempting
the
simplest
thing
in
the
simplest
way
has
done
it
almost
superbly
he
seems
to
be
entirely
without
theories
there
is
no
pedagogical
passion
in
him
he
is
no
reformer
but
more
than
any
of
the
reformers
now
or
lately
in
the
arena
he
is
a
poet
vii
the
heir
of
mark
twain
nothing
could
be
stranger
than
the
current
celebrity
of
irvin
cobb
an
author
of
whom
almost
as
much
is
heard
as
if
he
were
a
new
thackeray
or
molière
one
is
solemnly
told
by
various
extravagant
partisans
some
of
them
not
otherwise
insane
that
he
is
at
once
the
successor
to
mark
twain
and
the
heir
of
edgar
allan
poe
one
hears
of
public
dinners
given
in
devotion
to
his
genius
of
public
presentations
of
learned
degrees
conferred
upon
him
by
universities
of
other
extraordinary
adulations
few
of
them
shared
by
such
relatively
puny
fellows
as
howells
and
dreiser
his
talents
and
sagacity
pass
into
popular
anecdotes
he
has
sedulous
boswells
he
begins
to
take
on
the
august
importance
of
an
behind
the
scenes
of
course
a
highly
dexterous
publisher
pulls
the
strings
but
much
of
it
is
undoubtedly
more
or
less
sincere
men
pledge
their
sacred
honor
to
the
doctrine
that
his
existence
honors
the
national
literature
moreover
he
seems
to
take
the
thing
somewhat
seriously
himself
he
gives
his
to
various
other
authors
including
joseph
conrad
he
engages
himself
to
lift
the
literary
tone
of
he
lends
his
name
to
movements
he
exposes
himself
in
the
chautauquas
he
takes
on
the
responsibilities
of
a
patriot
and
a
public
man
altogether
a
curious
and
in
some
of
its
aspects
a
caressingly
ironical
spectacle
one
wonders
what
the
graduate
sophomores
of
composing
their
dull
tomes
upon
american
letters
will
make
of
it
in
the
actual
books
of
the
man
i
can
find
nothing
that
seems
to
justify
so
much
enthusiasm
nor
even
the
hundredth
part
of
it
his
serious
fiction
shows
a
certain
undoubted
facility
but
there
are
at
least
forty
other
americans
who
do
the
thing
quite
as
well
his
public
bulls
and
ukases
are
no
more
than
clever
and
inconsequential
first
saying
one
thing
and
then
quite
another
thing
and
in
his
humor
which
his
admirers
apparently
put
first
among
his
products
i
can
discover
at
best
nothing
save
a
somewhat
familiar
aptitude
for
grotesque
anecdote
and
at
worst
only
the
laborious
of
bill
nye
in
the
volume
called
those
times
and
these
there
is
an
excellent
comic
story
to
wit
hark
from
the
tomb
but
it
would
surely
be
an
imbecility
to
call
it
a
masterpiece
too
many
other
authors
have
done
things
quite
as
good
more
than
a
few
i
need
cite
only
george
ade
owen
johnson
and
ring
lardner
have
done
things
very
much
better
worse
it
lies
in
the
book
like
a
slice
of
smithfield
ham
between
two
slabs
of
stale
on
both
sides
of
it
are
very
stupid
without
point
stories
in
which
rustic
characters
try
to
talk
like
wilson
mizner
stories
altogether
and
depressing
turn
now
to
another
book
vastly
praised
in
its
name
cobb
s
one
laughs
precisely
as
one
laughs
over
a
comic
supplement
or
the
jokes
in
s
for
example
there
never
was
a
hansom
cab
made
that
would
hold
a
fat
man
comfortably
unless
he
left
the
doors
open
and
that
makes
him
feel
undressed
again
your
hair
gives
you
bother
so
long
as
you
have
it
and
more
bother
when
it
starts
to
go
you
are
always
doing
something
for
it
and
it
is
always
showing
ingratitude
in
return
or
else
the
dye
isn
t
deep
enough
which
is
even
worse
exactly
it
is
even
worse
and
then
this
once
there
was
a
manicure
lady
who
wouldn
t
take
a
tip
but
she
is
now
no
more
her
indignant
sisters
stabbed
her
to
death
with
hatpins
and
i
do
not
think
i
quote
unfairly
i
have
tried
to
select
honest
specimens
of
the
author
s
fancy
perhaps
it
may
be
well
to
glance
at
another
book
i
choose
at
random
speaking
of
a
work
described
by
the
publisher
as
the
funniest
yet
written
by
cobb
and
the
funniest
book
we
know
in
this
judgment
many
other
persons
seem
to
have
concurred
the
thing
was
an
undoubted
success
when
it
appeared
as
an
article
in
the
evening
and
it
sold
thousands
of
copies
between
covers
well
what
is
in
it
in
it
after
a
diligent
reading
i
find
half
a
dozen
mildly
clever
sixty
odd
pages
of
ancient
and
infantile
wheezes
as
flat
to
the
taste
as
so
many
crystals
of
hyposulphite
of
soda
for
example
the
wheeze
to
the
effect
that
in
the
days
of
the
author
s
nonage
germs
had
not
been
invented
for
example
the
wheeze
to
the
effect
that
doctors
bury
their
mistakes
for
example
the
wheeze
to
the
effect
that
the
doctor
always
prescribed
medicines
of
abominably
evil
flavor
but
let
us
go
into
the
volume
more
in
detail
and
so
unearth
all
its
gems
on
page
in
the
very
first
paragraph
there
is
the
doddering
old
joke
about
the
steepness
of
doctors
bills
in
the
second
paragraph
there
is
the
somewhat
newer
but
still
fully
adult
joke
about
the
extreme
willingness
of
persons
who
have
been
butchered
by
surgeons
to
talk
about
it
afterward
these
two
witticisms
are
all
that
i
can
find
on
page
for
the
rest
it
consists
almost
entirely
of
a
reference
to
mm
bryan
and
reference
well
known
by
all
newspaper
paragraphists
and
vaudeville
monologists
to
be
as
provocative
of
laughter
as
a
mention
of
bunions
or
pottstown
on
page
bryan
and
roosevelt
are
succeeded
by
certain
heavy
stuff
in
the
petroleum
nasby
manner
upon
the
condition
of
obstetrics
pediatrics
and
the

page
starts
off
with
the
old
jocosity
to
the
effect
that
people
talk
too
much
about
the
weather
it
progresses
or
resolves
as
the
musicians
say
into
the
wheeze
to
the
effect
that
people
like
to
dispute
over
what
is
the
best
thing
to
eat
for
breakfast
on
page
we
come
to
what
musicians
would
call
the
formal
statement
of
the
main
is
of
the
motif
we
have
thus
covered
four
pages
page
starts
out
with
an
enharmonic
change
to
wit
from
the
idea
that
like
to
talk
of
their
operations
to
the
idea
that
patients
in
being
like
to
swap
symptoms
following
this
there
is
a
repetition
of
the
gold
is
the
theme
of
the
doctor
s
bill
on
page
there
are
two
chuckles
one
springs
out
of
a
reference
to
light
housekeeping
a
phrase
which
invariably
strikes
an
american
vaudeville
audience
as
salaciously
whimsical
the
other
is
grounded
upon
the
desire
of
baseball
fans
to
cut
the
umpire
s
throat
on
page
there
enters
for
the
first
time
what
may
be
called
the
second
theme
of
the
book
this
is
the
whiskers
motif
the
whole
of
this
page
with
the
exception
of
a
sentence
embodying
the
old
wheeze
about
the
happy
times
before
germs
were
invented
is
given
over
to
variations
of
the
whiskers
joke
page
continues
this
development
section
whiskers
of
various
fantastic
varieties
are
whiskers
bosky
whiskers
ambush
whiskers
loose
luxuriant
whiskers
landscaped
whiskers
whiskers
that
are
winter
quarters
for
pathogenic
organisms
some
hard
hard
squeezing
and
the
humor
in
whiskers
is
temporarily
exhausted
page
closes
with
the
old
joke
about
the
cruel
thumping
which
doctors
perform
upon
their
patients
clavicles
now
for
page
it
opens
with
a
third
statement
of
the
gold
he
then
took
my
temperature
and
following
comes
the
dentist
s
office
is
the
motif
of
reluctance
of
oozing
courage
of
flight
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
the
gold
motif
is
repeated
in
the
key
of
e
minor
pages
and
are
devoted
to
simple
description
with
very
little
effort
at
humor
on
page
there
is
a
second
statement
for
the
full
brass
choir
of
the
dentist
s
office
motif
on
page
there
are
more
echoes
from
petroleum
nasby
the
subject
this
time
being
a
man
who
got
his
spleen
back
from
the
doctor
s
and
now
keeps
it
in
a
bottle
of
on
page
one
finds
the
innocent
bystander
joke
on
page
the
joke
about
the
terrifying
effects
of
reading
a
patent
medicine
almanac
also
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
there
is
a
third
statement
of
the
dentist
s
office
joke
on
page
it
gives
way
to
a
restatement
of
the
whiskers
theme
in
augmentation
which
in
turn
yields
to
the
third
or
fifth
restatement
of
the
gold
theme
let
us
now
jump
a
few
pages
on
page
we
come
to
the
old
joke
about
the
talkative
barber
on
page
to
the
joke
about
the
book
agent
on
the
same
page
to
the
joke
about
the
fashionableness
of
appendicitis
on
page
to
the
joke
about
the
clumsy
carver
who
projects
the
turkey
s
gizzard
into
the
visiting
pastor
s
eye
on
page
to
a
restatement
of
the
barber
joke
on
page
to
another
it
the
fifth
or
sixth
the
dentist
s
office
joke
on
page
to
the
katzenjammer
joke
on
page
to
the
old
joke
about
doctors
burying
their
mistakes
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
on
pages
and
there
is
a
perfect
riot
of
old
jokes
including
the
nth
variation
of
the
whiskers
joke
and
a
fearful
and
wonderful
pun
about
belgian
hares
and
heirs
on
second
thoughts
i
go
no
further
this
remember
is
the
book
that
cobb
s
publishers
apparently
with
his
own
choose
as
his
best
this
is
the
official
masterpiece
of
the
new
mark
nevertheless
even
so
laboriously
flabby
a
farceur
has
his
moments
i
turn
to
frank
wilstach
s
dictionary
of
similes
and
find
this
credited
to
him
no
more
privacy
than
a
here
at
last
is
something
genuinely
humorous
here
moreover
is
something
apparently
new
viii
hermann
sudermann
the
fact
that
sudermann
is
the
author
of
the
most
successful
play
that
has
come
out
of
germany
since
the
collapse
of
the
romantic
movement
is
the
most
eloquent
of
all
proofs
perhaps
of
his
lack
of
force
and
originality
as
a
dramatist
heimat
englished
frenched
and
italianized
as
magda
gave
a
new
and
gaudy
leading
rôle
to
all
the
chewers
of
scenery
they
fell
upon
it
as
upon
a
new
marguerite
gautier
and
with
it
they
coaxed
the
tears
of
all
nations
that
was
in
the
middle
nineties
the
piece
seems
almost
as
as
the
princess
bonnie
and
even
in
germany
it
has
gone
under
the
counter
if
it
is
brought
out
at
all
it
is
to
adorn
the
death
agonies
of
some
doddering
star
of
the
last
generation
sudermann
was
one
of
the
first
deer
flushed
by
arno
holz
and
johannes
schlaf
the
founders
of
german
naturalism
he
had
written
a
couple
of
successful
novels
frau
sorge
and
der
katzensteg
before
the
got
on
its
legs
and
so
he
was
a
recruit
worth
snaring
the
initial
fruit
of
his
enlistment
was
die
ehre
a
ad
of
prussian
notions
of
honor
as
incomprehensible
outside
of
germany
as
franz
adam
beyerlein
s
zapfenstreich
or
carl
bleibtreu
s
die
edelsten
der
then
followed
sodoms
ende
and
after
it
already
the
emptiness
of
naturalism
was
beginning
to
oppress
sudermann
as
it
was
also
oppressing
hauptmann
the
latter
in
rebounded
from
it
to
the
unblushing
romanticism
of
hanneles
as
for
sudermann
he
chose
to
temper
the
rigors
of
the
formula
by
ibsen
out
of
zola
with
sardoodledum
the
result
was
this
heimat
in
which
naturalism
was
wedded
to
a
mellow
sentimentality
caressing
to
audiences
bred
upon
the
drama
of
perfumed
adultery
the
whole
last
scene
of
the
play
indeed
was
no
more
than
an
echo
of
augier
s
le
mariage
d
it
is
no
wonder
that
even
sarah
bernhardt
pronounced
it
a
great
work
since
then
sudermann
has
wobbled
and
in
the
novel
as
well
as
in
the
drama
lacking
the
uncanny
versatility
of
hauptmann
he
has
been
unable
to
conquer
the
two
fields
of
romance
and
reality
instead
he
has
lost
himself
between
them
a
rat
without
a
tail
das
hohe
lied
his
most
successful
novel
since
frau
sorge
is
anything
but
a
work
its
opening
chapter
is
a
superlatively
fine
piece
of
writing
but
after
that
he
grows
uncertain
of
his
way
and
toward
the
end
one
begins
to
wonder
what
it
is
all
about
no
coherent
idea
is
in
it
it
is
simply
a
sentimentalization
of
the
unpleasant
if
it
were
not
for
the
naughtiness
of
some
of
the
scenes
no
one
would
read
it
an
american
dramatist
has
made
a
play
of
shocker
for
the
same
clowns
who
were
entranced
by
brieux
s
les
the
trouble
with
sudermann
here
and
elsewhere
is
that
he
has
no
sound
underpinnings
and
is
a
bit
uncertain
about
his
characters
and
his
story
he
starts
off
furiously
let
us
say
as
a
zola
and
then
dilutes
zolaism
with
romance
and
then
pulls
himself
up
and
begins
to
imitate
ibsen
and
then
trips
and
falls
headlong
into
the
sugar
bowl
of
sentimentality
lily
czepanek
in
das
hohe
lied
swoons
at
critical
moments
like
the
heroine
of
a
tale
for
chambermaids
it
is
almost
as
if
lord
jim
should
get
converted
at
a
gospel
mission
or
nora
helmer
let
down
her
hair
but
these
are
defects
in
sudermann
the
novelist
and
dramatist
and
in
that
sudermann
only
in
the
short
story
they
conceal
themselves
he
is
done
before
he
begins
to
vacillate
in
this
field
indeed
all
his
brisk
incisive
writing
of
flashing
observation
of
dexterous
stage
management
of
emotional
fire
and
a
chance
to
show
themselves
and
without
any
wearing
thin
the
book
translated
as
the
indian
lily
contains
some
of
the
best
short
stories
that
any
other
language
for
that
offer
they
are
mordant
succinct
and
extraordinarily
vivid
character
studies
each
full
of
penetrating
irony
and
sardonic
pity
each
with
the
chill
wind
of
disillusion
blowing
through
it
each
preaching
that
life
is
a
hideous
farce
that
good
and
bad
are
almost
meaningless
words
that
truth
is
only
the
lie
that
is
easiest
to
believe
it
is
hard
to
choose
between
stories
so
high
in
merit
but
surely
the
purpose
is
one
of
the
best
of
all
the
germans
only
ludwig
thoma
in
ein
bayrischer
soldat
has
ever
got
a
more
brilliant
reality
into
a
crowded
space
here
in
less
than
fifteen
thousand
words
sudermann
rehearses
the
tragedy
of
a
whole
life
and
so
great
is
the
art
of
the
thing
that
one
gets
a
sense
of
perfect
completeness
almost
of
exhaustiveness
antonie
wiesner
the
daughter
of
a
country
innkeeper
falls
in
love
with
robert
messerschmidt
a
medical
student
and
they
sin
the
scarlet
sin
to
robert
perhaps
the
thing
is
a
mere
interlude
of
midsummer
but
to
toni
it
is
all
life
s
meaning
and
glory
robert
is
poor
and
his
degree
is
still
two
years
ahead
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
him
to
marry
very
well
toni
will
find
a
father
for
her
child
she
is
her
lover
s
property
and
that
property
must
be
protected
and
she
will
wait
willingly
careless
of
the
years
for
the
distant
day
of
triumph
and
redemption
all
other
ideas
and
ideals
drop
out
of
her
mind
she
becomes
an
automaton
moved
by
the
one
impulse
the
one
yearning
she
marries
one
wiegand
a
decayed
innkeeper
he
poor
fool
accepts
the
parentage
of
her
child
her
father
rich
and
unsuspicious
buys
them
a
likely
inn
they
begin
to
make
money
and
then
begins
the
second
chapter
of
toni
s
sacrifice
she
robs
her
husband
systematically
and
steadily
she
takes
commissions
on
all
his
goods
she
becomes
the
houri
of
his
bar

may
grow
and
pickings
increase

goes
to

sees
him
through

university
it
gives
him
his
year
or
two
in
the
hospitals
it
buys
him
a

it
feeds
and

and
his
mother

him
the
months
and
years
pass

progress
is
slow
but
finally
the
great
day
approaches
soon
robert
will
be
ready
for
his
wife
but
of
him
toni
thinks
of
half
a
dozen
plans
the
notion
of
poisoning
him
gradually
formulates
itself
not
a
touch
of
horror
stays
her
she
is
by
this
time
beyond
all
the
common
monomaniac
with
no
thought
for
anything
save
her
great
purpose
but
an
accident
saves
wiegand
toni
too
elaborate
in
her
plans
poisons
herself
by
mischance
and
comes
near
dying
very
well
if
not
poison
then
some
more
subtle
craft
she
puts
a
barmaid
into
wiegand

path
she
manages
the
whole
affair
before
long
she
sees
her
victim
safely
enmeshed

her

she
is
off
to

in

little
flat
that
she
has
rented
in

and
her
child
the
child
of
robert
robert
is
to
come
at
noon
as
the
slow
moments
pass
the
burden
of
her
happiness
seems
too
great
to
bear
and
then
suddenly
the
ecstatic
ring
at
the
door
a
gentleman
entered
a
strange
gentleman
wholly
strange
had
she
met
him
on
the
street
she
would
not
have
known
him
he
had
grown
fifty
a
hundred
years
yet
his
real
age
could
not
be
over
he
had
grown
fat
he
carried
a
little
paunch
around
with
him
round
and
comfortable
and
the
honorable
scars
gleamed
in
round
red
cheeks
his
eyes
seemed
small
and
receding
and
when
he
said
here
i
am
at
last
it
was
no
longer
the
old
voice
clear
and
a
little
resonant
which
had
echoed
and
reëchoed
in
her
spiritual
ear
he
gurgled
as
though
he
had
swallowed
an
oaf
without
and
an
oaf
within
toni
is
for
splendors
triumphs
the
life
robert
has
settled
his
remote
village
hard
by
the
russian
border
is
to
his
liking
he
has
made
comfortable
friends
there
he
is
building
up
a
practice
he
is
of
course
a
man
of
honor
he
will
marry
and
with
gratitude
even
with
genuine
affection
going
further
he
will
pay
back
to
her
every
cent
that
ever
came
from
wiegand
s
till
he
has
kept
a
strict
account
here
it
is
in
a
little
blue
years
of
entries
as
he
reads
them
aloud
the
events
of
those
seven
years
unroll
themselves
before
toni
and
every
mark
brings
up
its
cash
and
trinkets
savings
in
railroad
fares
and
food
commissions
upon
furniture
and
wines
profits
of
champagne
debauches
with
the
county
councilor
sharp
trading
in
milk
and
eggs
suspense
and
longing
an
inextricable
web
of
falsification
and
trickery
of
terror
and
lying
without
end
the
memory
of
no
guilt
is
spared
robert
is
an
honest
an
honorable
man
he
has
kept
a
strict
account
the
money
is
waiting
in
bank
what
is
more
he
will
make
all
necessary
confessions
he
has
not
perhaps
kept
to
the
letter
of
fidelity
there
was
a
waitress
in
berlin
there
was
a
nurse
at
the
surgical
clinic
there
is
even
now
a
lithuanian
servant
girl
at
his
bachelor
quarters
the
last
named
of
course
will
be
sent
away
forthwith
robert
is
a
man
of
honor
a
man
sensitive
to
every
requirement
of
the
punctilio
a
gentleman
he
will
order
the
announcement
cards
consult
a
not
forget
to
get
rid
of
the
lithuanian
and
air
the
house
poor
toni
stares
at
him
as
he
departs
will
he
come
back
soon
asks
the
child
i
scarcely
think
so
she
answers
that
night
she
broke
the
purpose
of
her
life
the
purpose
that
had
become
interwoven
with
a
thousand
others
and
when
the
morning
came
she
wrote
a
letter
of
farewell
to
the
beloved
of
her
a
short
story
of
rare
and
excellent
quality
a
short
miracle
reading
twice
it
is
not
so
much
that
its
motive
is
motive
indeed
has
appeared
in
fiction
many
times
though
usually
with
the
man
as
the
that
its
workmanship
is
superb
sudermann
here
shows
that
for
all
his
failings
elsewhere
he
knows
superlatively
how
to
write
his
act
divisions
are
exactly
right
his
à
are
magnificently
managed
he
has
got
into
the
thing
that
rhythmic
ebb
and
flow
of
emotion
which
makes
for
great
drama
and
in
most
of
the
other
stories
in
this
book
you
will
find
much
the
same
skill
no
other
perhaps
is
quite
so
good
as
the
purpose
but
at
least
one
of
them
the
song
of
death
is
not
far
behind
here
we
have
the
tragedy
of
a
woman
brought
up
rigorously
puritanically
stupidly
who
discovers
just
as
it
is
too
late
that
love
may
be
a
wild
dance
an
ecstasy
an
orgy
i
can
imagine
no
more
grotesquely
pathetic
scene
than
that
which
shows
this
drab
preacher
s
wife
watching
by
her
husband
s
through
the
door
comes
the
sound
of
amorous
delirium
from
the
next
room
and
then
there
is
a
strangely
moving
christmas
story
merry
folk
with
the
hard
iron
in
it
and
there
are

is
the
curious
persistence
with
which
the
dons
native
to
the
land
have
overlooked
its
emerging
men
of
letters
i
mean
of
course
its
genuine
men
of
letters
its
salient
and
truly
original
men
its
men
of
intrinsic
and
unmistakable
distinction
the
have
fared
well
enough
god
knows
go
back
to
any
standard
literature
book
of
ten
or
twenty
or
thirty
or
fifty
years
ago
and
you
will
be
amazed
by
its
praise
of
shoddy
mediocrities
long
since
and
forgotten
george
william
curtis
now
seldom
heard
of
at
all
save
perhaps
in
the
reminiscences
of
senile
publishers
was
treated
in
his
day
with
all
the
deference
due
to
a
prince
of
the
blood
artemus
ward
petroleum
nasby
and
half
a
dozen
other
such
hollow
buffoons
were
ranked
with
mark
twain
and
even
above
him
frank
stockton
for
thirty
years
was
the
delight
of
all
reviewers
richard
henry
stoddard
and
edmund
clarence
stedman
were
eminent
personages
both
as
critics
and
as
poets
and
donald
mitchell
to
make
an
end
of
dull
names
bulked
so
grandly
in
the
academic
eye
that
he
was
snatched
from
his
and
his
to
become
a
charter
member
of
the
national
institute
of
arts
and
letters
and
actually
died
a
member
of
the
american
academy
meanwhile
three
of
the
five
indubitably
artists
that
america
has
produced
went
quite
without
orthodox
recognition
at
home
until
either
foreign
enthusiasm
or
domestic
clamor
from
below
forced
them
into
a
belated
and
grudging
sort
of
notice
i
need
not
say
that
i
allude
to
poe
whitman
and
mark
twain
if
it
ever
occurred
to
any
american
critic
of
position
during
poe
s
lifetime
that
he
was
a
greater
man
than
either
cooper
or
irving
then
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
trace
of
the
fact
in
the
critical
literature
of
the
time
the
truth
is
that
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
facile
and
somewhat
dubious
journalist
too
cocksure
by
half
and
not
a
man
to
be
encouraged
lowell
praised
him
in
and
at
the
same
time
denounced
the
current
of
lesser
men
but
later
on
this
encomium
was
diluted
with
very
important
reservations
and
there
the
matter
stood
until
baudelaire
discovered
the
poet
and
his
belated
fame
came
winging
home
whitman
as
every
one
knows
fared
even
worse
emerson
first
hailed
him
and
then
turned
tail
upon
him
eager
to
avoid
any
share
in
his
among
blockheads
no
other
critic
of
any
influence
gave
him
help
he
was
carried
through
his
dark
days
of
poverty
and
persecution
by
a
few
private
enthusiasts
none
of
them
with
the
ear
of
the
public
and
in
the
end
it
was
frenchmen
and
englishmen
who
lifted
him
into
the
light
imagine
a
harvard
professor
lecturing
upon
him
in
as
for
mark
twain
the
story
of
his
first
fifteen
years
has
been
admirably
told
by
william
lyon
phelps
of
yale
the
dons
were
unanimously
against
him
some
sneered
at
him
as
a
feeble
mountebank
others
refused
to
discuss
him
at
all
not
one
harbored
the
slightest
suspicion
that
he
was
a
man
of
genius
or
even
one
leg
of
a
man
of
genius
phelps
makes
merry
over
this
academic
attempt
to
dispose
of
mark
by
putting
him
into
himself
joins
the
sanctimonious
brethren
who
essay
the
same
enterprise
against
dreiser
i
come
by
this
route
to
george
perhaps
fails
to
fit
into
the
argument
doubly
for
on
the
one
hand
he
is
certainly
not
a
literary
artist
of
the
first
rank
and
on
the
other
hand
he
has
long
enjoyed
a
meed
of
appreciation
and
even
of
honor
for
the
national
institute
of
arts
and
letters
elevated
him
to
its
purple
in
its
first
days
and
he
is
still
on
its
roll
of
men
of
notable
achievement
in
art
music
or
literature
along
with
robert
chambers
henry
sydnor
harrison
oliver
herford
martin
and
townsend
author
of
chimmie
nevertheless
he
does
not
fall
too
far
outside
after
all
for
if
he
is
not
of
the
first
rank
then
he
surely
deserves
a
respectable
place
in
the
second
rank
and
if
the
national
institute
broke
the
spell
by
admitting
him
then
it
was
probably
on
the
theory
that
he
was
a
second
chambers
or
herford
or
maybe
even
a
second
martin
or
townsend
as
for
the
dons
they
hold
resolutely
to
the
doctrine
that
he
scarcely
exists
and
is
not
worth
noticing
at
all
for
example
there
is
fred
lewis
pattee
author
of
a
history
of
american
literature
since
pattee
notices
chambers
marion
harland
herford
townsend
amélie
rives
munkittrick
and
many
other
such
ornaments
of
the
national
letters
and
even
has
polite
bows
for
gelett
burgess
carolyn
wells
and
john
kendrick
bangs
but
the
name
of
ade
is
missing
from
his
index
as
is
that
of
dreiser
so
with
the
other
pedagogues
they
are
unanimously
shy
of
ade
in
their
for
sophomores
and
they
are
gingery
in
their
praise
of
him
in
their
innumerable
review
articles
he
is
commended
when
at
all
much
as
the
late
joseph
jefferson
used
to
be
is
to
the
accompaniment
of
reminders
that
even
a
clown
is
one
of
god
s
creatures
and
may
have
the
heart
of
a
christian
under
his
motley
the
most
laudatory
thing
ever
said
of
him
by
any
critic
of
the
apostolic
succession
so
far
as
i
can
discover
is
that
he
is
he
does
not
import
the
lewd
buffooneries
of
the
barroom
the
and
the
wedding
reception
into
his
books
but
what
are
the
facts
the
facts
are
that
ade
is
one
of
the
few
genuinely
original
literary
craftsmen
now
in
practice
among
us
that
he
comes
nearer
to
making
literature
when
he
has
full
steam
up
than
any
save
a
scant
of
our
current
novelists
and
that
the
whole
body
of
his
work
both
in
books
and
for
the
stage
is
as
thoroughly
american
in
cut
and
color
in
tang
and
savor
in
structure
and
point
of
view
as
the
work
of
howells
howe
or
mark
twain
no
single
american
novel
that
i
can
think
of
shows
half
the
sense
of
nationality
the
keen
feeling
for
national
prejudice
and
peculiarity
the
sharp
and
pervasive
americanism
of
such
adean
fables
as
the
good
fairy
of
the
eighth
ward
and
the
dollar
excursion
of
the
the
mandolin
players
and
the
willing
performer
and
the
adult
girl
who
got
busy
before
they
could
ring
the
bell
on
here
amid
a
humor
so
grotesque
that
it
almost
tortures
the
midriff
there
is
a
startlingly
vivid
and
accurate
evocation
of
the
american
scene
here
under
all
the
labored
extravagance
there
are
brilliant
flashlight
pictures
of
the
american
people
and
american
ways
of
thinking
and
the
whole
of
american
here
the
veritable
americano
stands
forth
lacking
not
a
waggery
a
superstition
a
snuffle
or
a
wen
ade
himself
for
all
his
s
pretense
of
remoteness
is
as
absolutely
american
as
any
of
his
traders
and
pushers
shylocks
and
dogberries
beaux
and
belles
no
other
writer
of
our
generation
save
perhaps
howe
is
more
unescapably
national
in
his
every
gesture
and
trick
of
mind
he
is
as
american
as
buckwheat
cakes
or
the
knights
of
pythias
or
the
chautauqua
or
billy
sunday
or
a
bull
by
wilson
he
fairly
reeks
of
the
national
philistinism
the
national
respect
for
respectability
the
national
distrust
of
ideas
he
is
a
marcher
one
fancies
in
parades
he
joins
movements
and
movements
against
movements
he
knows
no
language
save
his
own
he
regards
a
roosevelt
quite
seriously
and
a
mozart
or
an
ibsen
as
a
joke
one
would
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
until
he
went
off
to
his
college
he
slept
in
his
underwear
and
read
the
but
like
dreiser
he
is
a
peasant
touched
by
the
divine
fire
somehow
a
great
instinctive
artist
got
himself
born
out
there
on
that
lush
indiana
farm
he
has
the
rare
faculty
of
seeing
accurately
even
when
the
thing
seen
is
directly
under
his
nose
and
he
has
the
still
rarer
faculty
of
recording
vividly
of
making
the
thing
seen
move
with
life
one
often
doubts
a
character
in
a
novel
even
in
a
good
novel
but
who
ever
doubted
gus
in
the
two
mandolin
players
or
mae
in
sister
mae
or
to
pass
from
the
fables
payson
in
mr
payson
s
satirical
christmas
here
with
strokes
so
crude
and
obvious
that
they
seem
to
be
laid
on
with
a
broom
ade
achieves
what
henry
with
all
his
ingenuity
always
failed
to
achieve
he
fills
his
bizarre
tales
with
human
beings
there
is
never
any
artfulness
on
the
surface
the
tale
itself
is
never
novel
or
complex
it
never
surprises
often
it
is
downright
banal
but
underneath
there
is
an
artfulness
infinitely
well
wrought
and
that
is
the
artfulness
of
a
who
dredges
his
story
out
of
his
people
swiftly
and
skillfully
and
does
not
squeeze
his
people
into
his
story
laboriously
and
unconvincingly
needless
to
say
a
moralist
stands
behind
the
comedian
he
would
teach
he
even
grows
indignant
roaring
like
a
yokel
at
a
burlesque
show
over
such
wild
and
jocosities
as
paducah
s
favorite
comedians
and
why
gondola
was
put
away
one
turns
with
something
of
a
start
to
such
things
as
little
lutie
the
honest
money
maker
and
the
corporation
director
and
the
mislaid
up
to
a
certain
point
it
is
all
laughter
but
after
that
there
is
a
flash
of
the
knife
a
show
of
teeth
here
a
national
limitation
often
closes
in
upon
the
satirist
he
can
not
quite
separate
the
unaccustomed
from
the
abominable
he
is
unable
to
avoid
rattling
his
philistine
trappings
a
bit
proudly
he
must
prove
that
he
too
is
a
american
a
solid
citizen
and
a
patriot
unshaken
in
his
lofty
rectitude
by
such
poisons
as
aristocracy
adultery
d
and
the
sonata
form
but
in
other
directions
this
thoroughgoing
nationalism
helps
him
rather
than
hinders
him
it
enables
him
for
one
thing
to
see
into
sentimentality
and
to
comprehend
it
and
project
it
accurately
i
know
of
no
book
which
displays
the
mooniness
of
youth
with
more
feeling
and
sympathy
than
artie
save
it
be
frank
norris
forgotten
in
such
fields
ade
achieves
a
success
that
is
rare
and
indubitable
he
makes
the
thing
charming
and
he
makes
it
plain
but
all
these
fables
and
other
compositions
of
his
are
mere
sketches
inconsiderable
trifles
impromptus
in
bad
english
easy
to
write
and
of
no
importance
are
they
indeed
do
not
believe
it
for
a
moment
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
when
ade
was
at
the
height
of
his
celebrity
as
a
newspaper
sganarelle
scores
of
hack
comedians
tried
to
imitate
all
failed
i
myself
was
of
the
number
i
operated
a
funny
column
in
a
daily
newspaper
and
like
my
colleagues
near
and
far
i
essayed
to
manufacture
fables
in
slang
what
miserable
botches
they
were
how
easy
it
was
to
imitate
ade
s
how
impossible
to
imitate
his
matter
no
please
don
t
get
the
notion
that
it
is
a
simple
thing
to
write
such
a
fable
as
that
of
the
seance
and
the
limit
that
ceased
to
be
or
that
of
the
preacher
who
flew
his
kite
but
not
because
he
wished
to
do
so
or
that
of
the
roystering
far
from
it
on
the
contrary
the
only
way
you
will
ever
accomplish
the
feat
will
be
by
first
getting
ade
s
firm
grasp
upon
american
character
and
his
ability
to
think
out
a
straightforward
simple
amusing
story
and
his
alert
feeling
for
contrast
and
climax
and
his
extraordinary
talent
for
devising
novel
vivid
and
unforgettable
phrases
those
phrases
of
his
sometimes
wear
the
external
vestments
of
a
passing
slang
but
they
are
no
more
commonplace
and
vulgar
at
bottom
than
gray
s
mute
inglorious
milton
or
the
somewheres
east
of
suez
of
kipling
they
reduce
an
idea
to
a
few
pregnant
syllables
they
give
the
attention
a
fillip
and
light
up
a
whole
scene
in
a
flash
they
are
the
running
evidences
of
an
eye
that
sees
clearly
and
of
a
mind
that
thinks
shrewdly
they
give
distinction
to
the
work
of
a
man
who
has
so
well
concealed
a
highly
complex
and
efficient
artistry
that
few
have
ever
noticed
it
x
the
butte
bashkirtseff
of
all
the
who
have
raised
a
tarletan
black
flag
in
these
states
surely
mary
maclane
is
one
of
the
most
pathetic
when
at
nineteen
she
fluttered
vassar
with
the
story
of
mary
maclane
the
truth
about
her
was
still
left
somewhat
obscure
the
charm
of
her
flapperhood
so
to
speak
distracted
attention
from
it
and
so
concealed
it
but
when
at
she
achieved
i
mary
maclane
it
emerged
she
had
learned
to
describe
her
malady
accurately
though
she
still
wondered
a
bit
wistfully
just
what
it
was
and
that
malady
that
truth
simply
that
a
scotch
presbyterian
with
a
soaring
soul
is
as
cruelly
beset
as
a
wolf
with
fleas
a
zebra
with
the
botts
let
a
spark
of
the
divine
fire
spring
to
life
in
that
arid
corpse
and
it
must
fight
its
way
to
flame
through
a
drum
fire
of
wet
sponges
a
humming
bird
immersed
in
walter
pater
writing
for
the
london
lucullus
traveling
steerage
a
puritan
wooed
and
tortured
by
the
leers
of
beauty
mary
maclane
in
a
moral
republic
in
a
presbyterian
diocese
in
butte
i
hope
my
figures
of
speech
are
not
too
abstruse
what
i
mean
to
say
is
simply
this
that
the
secret
of
mary
maclane
is
simply
this
that
the
origin
of
all
her
inchoate
naughtiness
is
simply
this
that
she
is
a
puritan
who
has
heard
the
call
of
joy
and
is
struggling
against
it
damnably
remember
so
much
and
the
whole
of
her
wistful
heresy
becomes
intelligible
on
the
one
hand
the
loveliness
of
the
world
enchants
her
on
the
other
hand
the
fires
of
hell
warn
her
this
tortuous
conflict
accounts
for
her
whole
bag
of
tricks
her
timorous
flirtations
with
the
devil
her
occasional
outbreaks
of
rebellion
her
hurried
protestations
of
virginity
above
all
her
incurable
philistinism
one
need
not
be
told
that
she
admires
the
late
major
general
roosevelt
and
atherton
that
she
wallows
in
the
poetry
of
keats
one
knows
quite
as
well
that
her
phonograph
plays
the
peer
gynt
suite
and
that
she
is
charmed
by
the
syllogisms
of
chesterton
she
is
in
brief
an
absolutely
typical
american
of
the
transition
stage
between
christian
endeavor
and
civilization
there
is
in
her
a
definite
poison
of
ideas
an
æsthetic
impulse
that
will
not
every
time
she
yields
to
it
she
is
halted
and
plucked
back
by
qualms
and
doubts
by
the
dominant
superstitions
of
her
race
and
time
by
the
dead
hand
of
her
scotch
forebears
it
is
precisely
this
grisly
touch
upon
her
shoulder
that
stimulates
her
to
those
naïve
explosions
of
scandalous
confidence
which
make
her
what
she
is
if
there
were
no
sepulchral
voice
in
her
ear
warning
her
that
it
is
the
mark
of
a
hussy
to
be
kissed
by
a
man
with
hair
a
brow
like
apollo
and
a
jowl
like
bill
sykes
she
would
not
confess
it
and
boast
of
it
as
she
does
on
page
of
i
mary
if
it
were
not
a
presbyterian
axiom
that
a
lady
who
says
damn
is
fit
only
to
join
the
white
slaves
she
would
not
pen
a
defiant
damniad
as
she
does
on
pages
and
and
if
it
were
not
held
universally
in
butte
that
sex
passion
is
the
exclusive
infirmity
of
the
male
she
would
not
blab
out
in
meeting
here
i
get
into
forbidden
waters
and
had
better
refer
you
to
page
it
is
not
the
godless
voluptuary
who
patronizes
and
the
cabaret
it
is
the
methodist
deacon
with
unaccustomed
in
his
hair
it
is
not
genuine
artists
serving
beauty
reverently
and
proudly
who
herd
in
greenwich
village
and
bawl
for
art
it
is
precisely
a
mob
of
middle
western
baptists
to
whom
the
very
idea
of
art
is
still
novel
and
intoxicating

more
than
a
little
bawdy
and
to
make
an
end
it
is
not
cocottes
who
read
the
magazines
which
burden
all
the
it
is
sedentary
married
women
who
while
faithful
to
their
depressing
husbands
in
the
flesh
yet
allow
their
imaginations
to
play
furtively
upon
the
charms
of
theoretical
intrigues
with
such
pretty
fellows
as
francis
bushman
enrico
caruso
and
vincent
astor
an
understanding
of
this
plain
fact
not
only
explains
the
maclane
and
her
gingery
carnalities
of
the
chair
it
also
explains
a
good
part
of
american
literature
that
literature
is
the
of
a
people
who
have
got
only
half
way
up
the
ladder
leading
from
moral
slavery
to
intellectual
freedom
at
every
step
there
is
a
warning
tug
a
protest
from
below
sometimes
the
climber
docilely
drops
back
sometimes
he
emits
a
petulant
defiance
and
reaches
boldly
for
the
next
round
it
is
this
occasional
defiance
which
accounts
for
the
periodical
efflorescence
of
mere
naughtiness
in
the
midst
of
our
oleaginous
the
shouldering
out
of
the
home
by
magazines
of
adultery
all
the
provocative
baring
of
calf
and
scapula
by
women
who
regard
it
as
immoral
to
take
benedictine
with
their
the
peopling
of
greenwich
village
by
oafs
who
think
it
a
devilish
adventure
to
victual
in
cellars
and
read
and
stare
at
the
nakedness
of
decadent
i
have
said
that
the
climber
is
but
half
way
up
the
ladder
i
wish
i
could
add
that
he
is
moving
ahead
but
the
truth
is
that
he
is
probably
quite
stationary
we
have
our
spasms
of
revolt
our
flarings
up
of
peekaboo
waists
free
love
and
art
but
a
mighty
backwash
of
piety
fetches
each
and
every
one
of
them
soon
or
late
a
mongrel
and
inferior
people
incapable
of
any
spiritual
aspiration
above
that
of
english
colonials
we
seek
refuge
inevitably
in
the
one
sort
of
superiority
that
the
lower
castes
of
men
can
authentically
boast
to

superiority
in
docility
in
credulity
in
resignation
in
morals
we
are
the
most
moral
race
in
the
world
there
is
not
another
that
we
do
not
look
down
upon
in
that
department
our
confessed
aim
and
destiny
as
a
nation
is
to
inoculate
them
all
with
our
incomparable
rectitude
in
the
last
analysis
all
ideas
are
judged
among
us
by
moral
standards
moral
values
are
our
only
permanent
tests
of
worth
whether
in
the
arts
in
politics
in
philosophy
or
in
life
itself
even
the
instincts
of

so
intrinsically
immoral
so
innocent
are
fitted
with
moral
that
bedevilment
by
sex
ideas
which
punishes
continence
so
abhorrent

moral
frenzy

up

by
incomprehensible
taboos

i
believe
who
set
going
the
doctrine
that
robert
chambers
is
a
man
of
bit
too
commercial
perhaps
but
still
fundamentally
a
man
of
talent
you
will
find
it
argued
at
length
in
their
day
in
there
pollard
called
the
roll
of
the
promising
young
men
of
the
time
they
were
winston
churchill
david
graham
chambers
alas
for
all
prophets
and
their
prognostications
phillips
with
occasional
reversions
to
honest
work
devoted
most
of
his
later
days
to
sensational
serials
for
the
magazines
and
when
he
died
his
desk
turned
out
to
be
full
of
them
and
they
kept
dribbling
along
for
three
or
four
years
churchill
seduced
by
the
uplift
has
become
an
evangelist
and
a
worse
case
even
than
that
of
wells
and
chambers
let
the
new
york
answer
here
in
all
sobriety
is
its
description
of
the
heroine
of
the
moonlit
way
one
of
his
latest
pieces
she
is
a
lovely
and
fascinating
dancer
who
before
the
war
held
the
attention
of
all
europe
and
incited
a
great
many
men
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
to
fall
in
love
with
her
she
bursts
upon
the
astonished
gaze
of
several
of
the
important
characters
of
the
story
when
she
dashes
into
the
ballroom
of
the
german
embassy
upon
a
bridled
which
she
compels
to
dance
and
go
through
its
paces
at
her
command
she
is
dressed
mr
chambers
assures
us
nothing
but
the
skin
of
her
virtuous
youth
modified
slightly
by
a
yashmak
and
a
zone
of
blue
jewels
about
her
hips
and
the
italics
are
mine
i
wonder
what
poor
pollard
would
think
of
it
he
saw
the
shoddiness
in
chambers
the
leaning
toward
profitable
but
he
saw
too
a
fundamental
earnestness
and
a
high
degree
of
skill
what
has
become
of
these
things
are
they
visible
even
as
ghosts
in
the
preposterous
serials
that
engaud
the
magazines
of
hearst
and
then
load
the
as
books
were
they
in
fact
ever
there
at
all
did
pollard
observe
them
or
did
he
merely
imagine
them
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
merely
imagined
his
delight
in
what
he
described
as
many
admirable
tricks
led
him
into
a
fatuity
that
he
now
has
an
eternity
to
regret
chambers
grows
sillier
and
sillier
emptier
and
emptier
worse
and
worse
but
was
he
ever
more
than
a
i
doubt
it
let
us
go
back
half
a
dozen
years
to
the
days
before
the
war
forced
the
down
into
utter
imbecility
i
choose
at
random
the
gay
here
is
a
specimen
of
the
dialogue
it
startled
me
how
did
i
know
what
it
might
have
been
it
might
have
been
a
a
you
talk
said
sayre
angrily
like
william
dean
howells
haven
t
you
romance
in
you
not
what
call
romance
pass
the
sayre
passed
them
my
attention
he
said
instantly
became
riveted
upon
the
bushes
i
strove
to
pierce
them
with
a
piercing
glance
sure
suddenly
always
comes
suddenly
the
leaves
were
stealthily
parted
a
naked
savage
in
full
war
naked
nothing
a
young
girl
perfectly
fitting
gown
stepped
noiselessly
out
of
what
you
gink
the
bushes
dammit
she
looked
at
me
i
gazed
at
her
in
plainer
terms
she
gave
you
the
eye
what
that
s
a
peculiarly
coarse
then
tell
it
in
your
own
i
will
the
sunlight
fell
softly
upon
the
trees
of
the
ancient
that
bark
you
and
so
on
and
so
on
for
page
after
page
can
you
imagine
more
idiotic
pierce
and
piercing
you
gink
she
gave
you
the
eye
that
bark
you
one
is
reminded
of
horrible
repartees
of
comedians
in
vaudeville
the
whimsical
editorials
in
the
forbidding
of
irvin
cobb
among
jokes
pale
and
clammy
in
death
but
let
us
you
may
say
go
back
a
bit
to
the
days
of
the
there
was
then
perhaps
a
far
different
fellow
of
sound
talent
and
artistic
well
deserving
the
confidence
and
encouragement
of
pollard
was
there
indeed
if
you
think
so
go
read
the
king
in
yellow
you
can
i
myself
full
of
hope
have
tried
it
in
it
i
have
found
drivel
almost
as
dull
as
that
say
in
ailsa
stranger
on
the
case
of
hamlin
garland
belongs
to
pathos
in
the
grand
manner
as
you
will
discover
on
reading
his
autobiography
a
son
of
the
middle
what
ails
him
is
a
vision
of
beauty
a
seductive
strain
of
bawdy
music
over
the
hills
he
is
a
sort
of
male
mary
maclane
but
without
either
mary
s
capacity
for
picturesque
blasphemy
or
her
skill
at
plain
english
the
vision
in
his
youth
tore
him
from
his
prairie
plow
and
set
him
to
clawing
the
anthills
at
the
foot
of
parnassus
he
became
an
in
modern
times
would
be
called
a
chautauquan
he
aspired
to
write
for
the
he
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
boston
of
which
is
as
if
one
were
to
take
fire
from
a
finally
after
embracing
the
single
tax
he
achieved
a
couple
of
depressing
earnest
honest
and
full
of
indignation
american
criticism
which
always
mistakes
a
poignant
document
for
æsthetic
form
and
organization
greeted
these
moral
volumes
as
works
of
art
and
so
garland
found
himself
an
accepted
artist
and
has
made
shift
to
be
an
artist
ever
since
no
more
grotesque
miscasting
of
a
diligent
and
worthy
man
is
recorded
in
profane
history
he
has
no
more
feeling
for
the
intrinsic
dignity
of
beauty
no
more
comprehension
of
it
as
a
thing
in
itself
than
a
policeman
he
is
and
always
has
been
a
moralist
endeavoring
ineptly
to
translate
his
messianic
passion
into
æsthetic
terms
and
always
failing
a
son
of
the
middle
border
undoubtedly
the
best
of
all
his
books
projects
his
failure
brilliantly
it
is
in
substance
a
document
of
considerable
naïve
and
often
highly
illuminating
contribution
to
the
history
of
the
american
peasantry
it
is
in
form
a
thoroughly
piece
of
flat
banal
repellent
garland
gets
facts
into
it
he
gets
the
relentless
sincerity
of
the
rustic
puritan
he
gets
a
sort
of
evangelical
passion
but
he
doesn
t
get
any
charm
he
doesn
t
get
any
beauty
in
such
a
career
as
in
such
a
book
there
is
something
profoundly
pathetic
one
follows
the
progress
of
the
man
with
a
constant
sense
that
he
is
steering
by
faulty
compasses
that
fate
is
leading
him
into
paths
too
steep
and
too
dark
and
him
an
awareness
of
beauty
is
there
and
a
wistful
desire
to
embrace
it
but
the
confident
gusto
of
the
artist
is
always
lacking
what
one
encounters
in
its
place
is
the
enthusiasm
of
the
pedagogue
the
desire
to
yank
the
world
up
to
the
soaring
methodist
level
the
hot
yearning
to
displace
old
ideas
with
new
ideas
and
usually
much
worse
ideas
for
example
the
single
tax
and
the
natural
goal
of
the
man
was
the
evangelical
stump
he
was
led
astray
when
those
boston
brahmins
of
the
last
generation
enchanted
by
his
sophomoric
platitudes
about
shakespeare
set
him
up
as
a
critic
of
the
arts
and
then
as
an
imaginative
artist
he
should
have
gone
back
to
the
saleratus
belt
taken
to
the
chautauquas
preached
his
foreordained
perunas
got
himself
into
congress
and
so
helped
to
save
the
republic
from
the
demons
that
beset
it
what
a
gladiator
he
would
have
made
against
the
plunderbund
the
white
slave
traffic
the
rum
demon
the
kaiser
what
a
rival
to
the
hon
claude
kitchin
the
rev
newell
dwight
hillis
his
worst
work
i
daresay
is
in
some
of
his
example
in
the
forester
s
but
my
own
favorite
among
his
books
is
the
shadow
world
a
record
of
his
communings
with
the
gaseous
precipitates
of
the
departed
he
takes
great
pains
at
the
start
to
assure
us
that
he
is
a
man
of
alert
intelligence
and
without
prejudices
or
superstitions
he
has
no
patience
it
appears
with
those
idiots
who
swallow
the
buffooneries
of
spiritualist
mediums
too
greedily
for
him
the
scientific
method
which
examines
all
evidence
cynically
and
keeps
on
doubting
until
the
accumulated
proof
piled
sweeps
down
in
an
overwhelming
avalanche
thus
he
proceeds
to
the
haunted
chamber
and
begins
his
dalliance
with
the
banshees
they
touch
him
with
clammy
spectral
hands
they
wring
music
for
him
out
of
locked
pianos
they
throw
heavy
tables
about
the
room
they
give
him
messages
from
the
golden
shore
and
make
him
the
butt
of
their
coarse
transcendental
humor
through
it
all
he
sits
tightly
and
solemnly
his
mind
open
and
his
verdict
up
his
sleeve
he
is
belligerently
agnostic
and
calls
attention
to
it
proudly
then
in
the
end
he
gives
himself
away
one
of
his
fellow
scientists
more
frankly
credulous
expresses
the
belief
that
real
scientists
will
soon
prove
the
existence
of
spooks
i
hope
they
will
says
the
agnostic
garland
well
let
us
not
laugh
the
believing
mind
is
a
curious
thing
it
must
absorb
its
endless
rations
of
balderdash
or
perish
a
son
of
the
middle
border
is
less
amusing
but
a
good
deal
more
respectable
it
is
an
honest
book
there
is
some
bragging
in
it
of
course
but
not
too
much
it
tells
an
interesting
story
it
radiates
hard
effort
and
earnest
purpose
but
what
a
devastating
exposure
of
a
member
of
the
american
academy
of
arts
and
letters
merchant
of
henry
sydnor
harrison
is
thoroughly
american
to
this
extent
that
his
work
is
a
bad
imitation
of
something
english
find
me
a
american
in
any
of
the
arts
and
i
ll
find
you
his
master
and
prototype
among
third
fourth
or
englishmen
in
the
present
case
the
model
is
obviously
locke
but
between
master
and
disciple
there
is
a
great
gap
locke
at
his
high
points
is
a
man
of
very

i
can
discover
no
sign
of
any
of

in

christmas
cards
they
are
simply
sentimental
for

to

over

often
extremely
amusing

are
missing
in

of

there
are

silent

maudlin
war
veterans
and
angelic

of

the

the

no

say
by

chaste

for

these
ancient
sweets
will
be
on

at
the
and
they
will
grow
sweeter
and
sweeter
i
daresay
as
he
works
them
over
and
over
in
his
very
first
book
of
fiction
there
was
a
flavor
of
and
marshmallows
in
a
certain
rich
man
the
intelligent
palate
detected
saccharine
in
in
the
heart
of
a
fool
his
latest
the
thing
is
carried
a
step
further
if
you
are
a
and
a
if
you
believe
that
god
is
in
his
heaven
and
all
is
for
the
best
if
you
yearn
to
uplift
and
like
to
sob
then
the
volume
will
probably
affect
you
in
the
incomparable
phrase
of
clayton
hamilton
like
the
music
of
a
million
leaping
from
the
grave
and
laughing
with
a
silver
but
if
you
are
a
carnal
fellow
as
i
am
with
a
stomach
ruined
by
alcohol
it
will
gag
you
when
i
say
that
white
is
a
victorian
i
do
not
allude
of
course
to
the
victorianism
of
thackeray
and
tennyson
but
to
that
of
felicia
hemens
of
samuel
smiles
and
of
dickens
at
his
most
maudlin
perhaps
an
even
closer
relative
is
to
be
found
in
the
white
like
the
duchess
is
absolutely
humorless
and
when
he
begins
laying
on
the
mayonnaise
absolutely
shameless
i
daresay
the
same
sort
of
reader
admires
both
the
girl
first
seized
by
amorous
tremors
the
obese
multipara
in
her
greasy
kimono
the
remote
and
weepful
but
here
a
doubt
intrudes
itself
is
it
possible
to
imagine
a
woman
sentimental
enough
to
survive
in
the
heart
of
a
fool
i
am
constrained
to
question
it
in
women
once
they
get
beyond
adolescence
there
is
always
a
saving
touch
of
irony
the
life
they
lead
infallibly
makes
cynics
of
them
though
sometimes
they
don
t
know
it
observe
the
books
they
sardonic
stuff
with
heroes
who
are
fools
even
their
glad
books
enormously
successful
among
other
women
stop
far
short
of
the
sentimentality
put
between
covers
by
example
the
aforesaid
harrison
harold
bell
wright
and
the
present
white
nay
it
is
the
male
sex
that
snuffles
most
and
is
easiest
touched
particularly
in
america
the
american
man
is
forever
falling
a
victim
to
his
tender
feelings
it
was
by
that
route
that
the
collectors
for
the
reached
him
it
is
thus
that
he
is
bagged
incessantly
by
political
it
is
precisely
his
softness
that
makes
him
the
slave
of
his
what
white
gives
him
is
exactly
the
sort
of
mush
that
is
on
tap
in
the
chautauquas
in
the
heart
of
a
fool
like
a
certain
rich
man
is
aimed
deliberately
and
with
the
utmost
accuracy
at
the
delicate
gizzard
of
the
yokel
the
yokel
the
horrible
of
fifty
years
of
christian
endeavor
the
little
red
schoolhouse
and
the
direct
primary
the
white
formula
is
simple
to
the
verge
of
austerity
it
is
in
essence
no
more
than
a
dramatization
of
all
the
current
political
and
sociological
by
roosevelt
out
of
coxey
s
army
with
music
by
the
choir
of
the
first
methodist
church
on
the
one
side
are
the
hell
hounds
of
plutocracy
the
money
demons
the
plunderbund
and
their
attendant
bosses
strike
breakers
seducers
nietzscheans
free
lovers
atheists
and
corrupt
journalists
on
the
other
side
are
the
great
masses
of
the
plain
people
and
their
attendant
uplifters
good
samaritans
honest
workingmen
faithful
husbands
inspired
dreamers
and
messiahs
these
two
armies
join
battle
the
bad
against
the
good
and
for
five
hundred
pages
or
more
the
good
get
all
the
worst
of
it
their
jobs
are
taken
away
from
them
their
votes
are
bartered
their
mortgages
are
foreclosed
their
women
are
debauched
their
savings
are
looted
their
poor
orphans
are
turned
out
to
starve
a
sad
business
surely
one
wallows
in
almost
unendurable
emotions
the
tears
gush
it
is
as
affecting
as
a
movie
even
the
prose
rises
to
a
sort
of
chant
like
that
of
a
baptist
savonarola
with
every
second
sentence
beginning
with
or
but
we
are
already
near
the
end
and
no
escape
is
in
sight
can
it
be
that
white
is
stumped
like
mark
twain
in
his
mediæval
virtue
will
succumb
to
the
interests
do
not

a
violet
and
then
a
blue

by

the
rays
of
hope
begin
to
shoot
across
the
stage
hamilton

leap
from
their
tomb
the
all
save
the
local
pierpont
morgan
begin
laughing
with
a
silver
singing
and
as
the
curtain
falls
the
whole
scene
is
bathed
in
luminiferous
ether
and
the
professor
breaks
into
onward
christian
soldiers
on
the
and
there
is
a
happy
comfortable
sobbing
and
an
upward
rolling
of
eyes
and
a
vast
blowing
of
noses
in
brief
the
finish
of
a
chautauqua
lecture
on
the
grand
future
of
america
or
the
glory
of
in
brief
slobber
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
more
saccharine
writing
or
a
more
mawkish
and
preposterous
point
of
view
life
as
white
sees
it
is
a
purely
moral
phenomenon
like
living
pictures
by
the
epworth
league
the
virtuous
are
the
downtrodden
the
up
and
doing
are
all
scoundrels
it
pays
to
be
poor
and
pious
ambition
is
a
serpent
one
honest
knight
of
pythias
is
worth
ten
thousand
rockefellers
the
pastor
is
always
right
so
is
the
home
the
impulse
that
leads
a
young
yokel
of
say
to
seek
marriage
with
a
poor
of
say
eighteen
is
the
most
elevating
noble
honorable
and
godlike
impulse
native
to
the
human
consciousness
not
the
slightest
sign
of
an
apprehension
of
life
as
the
gaudiest
and
most
gorgeous
of
a
trace
of
healthy
delight
in
the
eternal
struggle
for
the
faintest
suggestion
of
dreiser
s
great
gusto
or
of
conrad
s
penetrating
irony
not
even
in
the
massive
fact
of
death
like
all
the
other
victorians
this
one
from
the
kansas
steppes
is
given
to
wholesale
he
see
anything
mysterious
staggering
awful
inexplicable
but
only
an
excuse
for
a
sentimental
orgy
alas
what
would
you
it
is
ghastly
drivel
to
be
sure
but
isn
t
it
after
all
thoroughly
american
i
have
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
it
in
the
heart
of
a
fool
is
at
bottom
a
vastly
more
american
book
than
anything
that
james
branch
cabell
has
done
or
vincent
o
sullivan
or
edith
wharton
or
even
howells
it
springs
from
the
heart
of
the
land
it
is
the
æsthetic
echo
of
thousands
of
movements
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
sentimental
crusades
of
millions
of
ecstatic
this
is
what
the
authentic
american
public
unpolluted
by
intelligence
wants
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
english
sniff
whenever
they
look
our
way
but
has
white
no
merit
he
has
he
is
an
honest
and
a
respectable
man
he
is
a
patriot
he
trusts
god
he
venerates
what
is
left
of
the
constitution
he
once
wrote
a
capital
editorial
what
s
the
matter
with
kansas
he
has
the
knack
when
his
tears
are
turned
off
of
writing
a
clear
and
graceful
english
bad
as
i
have
said
it
is
not
the
artistic
merit
and
dignity
of
a
novel
but
often
simply
its
content
as
document
that
makes
for
its
success
in
the
united
states
the
criterion
of
truth
applied
to
it
is
not
the
criterion
of
an
artist
but
that
of
a
newspaper
editorial
writer
the
question
is
not
is
it
in
accord
with
the
profoundest
impulses
and
motives
of
humanity
but
is
it
in
accord
with
the
current
pishposh
this
accounts
for
the
huge
popularity
of
such
confections
as
upton
sinclair
s
the
jungle
and
blasco
ibáñez
s
the
four
horsemen
of
the
neither
had
much
value
as
a
work
of
all
events
neither
was
perceptibly
superior
to
many
contemporary
novels
that
made
no
stir
at
each
had
the
advantage
of
reënforcing
an
emotion
already
aroused
of
falling
into
step
with
the
procession
of
the
moment
had
there
been
no
fever
of
and
trust
busting
in
the
jungle
would
have
died
the
death
in
the
columns
of
the
to
unheard
of
by
the
populace
in
general
and
had
the
united
states
been
engaged
against
france
instead
of
for
france
in
there
would
have
been
no
argument
in
the
literary
weeklies
that
blasco
was
a
novelist
of
the
first
rank
and
his
story
a
masterpiece
comparable
to
sinclair
was
made
by
the
jungle
and
has
been
trying
his
hardest
to
unmake
himself
ever
since
another
of
the
same
sort
is
ernest
poole
author
of
the
the
harbor
judged
by
any
intelligible
æsthetic
standard
was
a
bad
novel
its
transactions
were
forced
and
unconvincing
its
central
character
was
shadowy
and
often
incomprehensible
the
manner
of
its
writing
was
quite
without
distinction
but
it
happened
to
be
printed
at
a
time
when
the
chief
ideas
in
it
had
a
great
deal
of
its
vague
grappling
with
insoluble
sociological
problems
was
the
sport
of
all
the
weeklies
and
of
half
the
more
sober
a
nebulous
highfalutin
bolshevism
was
in
the
so
it
excited
interest
and
took
on
an
aspect
of
profundity
that
its
discussion
of
those
problems
was
superficial
that
it
said
nothing
new
and
got
this
was
not
an
influence
against
its
success
but
an
influence
in
favor
of
its
success
for
the
sort
of
mind
that
fed
upon
the
nebulous
politics
and
sociology
of
was
the
sort
of
mind
that
is
chronically
avid
of
and
as
chronically
suspicious
of
forthright
thinking
this
has
been
demonstrated
since
that
time
by
its
easy
in
the
presence
of
emotion
the
very
ideas
that
poole
s
vapid
hero
toyed
with
in
to
the
delight
of
the
would
have
damned
the
book
as
a
pamphlet
for
the
or
even
perhaps
as
german
propaganda
three
years
later
but
meanwhile
it
had
been
forgotten
as
novels
are
always
forgotten
and
all
that
remained
of
it
was
a
general
impression
that
poole
in
some
way
or
other
was
a
superior
fellow
and
to
be
treated
with
respect
his
subsequent
books
have
tried
that
theory
severely
the
family
was
grounded
upon
one
of
the
elemental
tragedies
which
serve
a
novelist
most
dismay
of
an
aging
man
as
his
children
drift
away
from
him
here
was
a
subject
full
of
poignant
drama
and
what
is
more
drama
simple
enough
to
develop
itself
without
making
any
great
demand
upon
the
invention
poole
burdened
it
with
too
much
background
and
then
killed
it
altogether
by
making
his
characters
wooden
it
began
with
a
high
air
it
creaked
and
wobbled
at
the
close
the
catastrophe
was
quite
without
effect
his
second
wife
dropped
several
stories
lower
it
turned
out
on
inspection
to
be
no
more
than
a
moral
tale
feeble
and
irritating
everything
in
the
corrupting
effects
of
and
display
about
the
swinishness
of
cabaret
society
in
new
york
about
the
american
male
s
absurd
slavery
to
his
been
said
before
by
such
gifted
balzacs
as
robert
chambers
and
owen
johnson
and
what
is
more
far
better
said
the
writing
in
fact
exactly
matched
the
theme
it
was
labored
artificial
dull
in
the
whole
volume
there
was
not
a
single
original
phrase
once
it
was
put
down
not
a
scene
remained
in
the
memory
or
a
character
it
was
a
cheap
a
hollow
and
in
places
almost
an
idiotic
book
at
the
time
i
write
this
is
the
whole
product
of
poole

novelist
three

i
now
print
the
whole
passage
whenever
in
a
war
the
side
of

has
triumphed
a
great
overflowing
of

has
followed
soon
upon
the
fact
of

instincts
of
in
perilous
moments
fraught
with
intimations
of

and
soared
beneath
the
sunshine
of

and

into
an
immeasurable
empyrean
of
heroic
eloquence

has
sprung
alive
into
the

with
the
music
of

leaping
from

and
laughing
with

singing
with
the

for
a
a
pedagogue
of

in

and
the
classical

the
genealogy
of

is
yet
of

scarcely
a

at
all

rather
a
monkeyshine
which

the
youngest
of

sciences
and
hence
chiefly
guesswork
empiricism
poppycock
on
the
one
hand
there
are
still
enormous
gaps
in
its
data
so
that
the
determination
of
its
simplest
principles
remains
difficult
not
to
say
impossible
and
on
the
other
hand
the
very
hollowness
and
nebulosity
of
it
particularly
around
its
edges
encourages
a
horde
of
quacks
to
invade
it
sophisticate
it
and
make
nonsense
of
it
worse
this
state
of
affairs
tends
to
such
confusion
of
effort
and
direction
that
the
quack
and
the
honest
inquirer
are
often
found
in
the
same
man
it
is
indeed
a
commonplace
to
encounter
a
professor
who
spends
his
days
in
the
laborious
accumulation
of
psychological
statistics
sticking
pins
into
babies
and
platting
upon
a
chart
the
ebb
and
flow
of
their
yells
and
his
nights
chasing
poltergeists
and
other
such
celestial
fauna
over
the
hurdles
of
a
spiritualist
s
atelier
or
gazing
into
a
crystal
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
chamber
the
binét
test
and
the
buncombe
of
mesmerism
are
alike
the
children
of
what
we
roughly
denominate
psychology
and
perhaps
of
equal
legitimacy
even
so
ingenious
and
competent
an
investigator
as
sigmund
freud
who
has
told
us
a
lot
that
is
of
the
first
importance
about
the
materials
and
machinery
of
thought
has
also
told
us
a
lot
that
is
trivial
and
dubious
the
essential
doctrines
of
freudism
no
doubt
come
close
to
the
truth
but
many
of
freud
s
remoter
deductions
are
far
more
scandalous
than
sound
and
many
of
the
professed
freudians
both
american
and
european
have
on
their
noses
and
bladders
in
their
hands
and
are
otherwise
quite
indistinguishable
from
evangelists
and

wasting
its

upon

are
petty
and

and
passing
over

do
not

with
rejoicing

and

before
us

after
all
they
do

there
is
nothing
in

they
fail
to
make

more
bearable
what
we
yearn
to
know
something
about
is
the
process
whereby
the
ideas
of
everyday
are
engendered
in
the
skulls
of
those
about
us
to
the
end
that
we
may
pursue
a
straighter
and
a
safer
course
through
the
muddle
that
is
life
why
do
the

as

regard

are
the

behind
the

what

of

morality
what
is
the
true
nature
of
the
vague
pooling

rousseau
called

contract

does
an
american
regard
it
as
scandalous
to
wear
dress
clothes
at
a
funeral
and
a
frenchman
regard
it
as
equally
scandalous
to
wear
them
why
is
it
that
men
trust
one
another
so
readily
and
women
trust
one
another
so
seldom
why
are
we
all
so
greatly
affected
by
statements
that
we
know
are
not
true
in
lincoln
s
gettysburg
speech
the
declaration
of

and
the

psalm
what
is
the
origin
of
the
double
standard
of
morality
why
are
women
forbidden
to

off
their

in

what
is
happiness
intelligence
sin
courage
virtue
beauty
all
these
are
questions
of
interest

importance
to
all
of

their
solution
would
materially
improve
the
accuracy
of
our
outlook
upon
the
world
and
with
it
our
mastery
of
our
environment
but
the
psychologists
busily
engaged
in
chasing
their
tails
leave
them
unanswered
and
in
most
cases
even
unasked
the
late
william
james
more
acute
than
the
general
saw
how
precious
little
was
known
about
the
psychological
inwardness
of
religion
and
to
the
illumination
of
this
darkness
he
addressed
himself
in
his
book
the
varieties
of
religious
but
life
being
short
and
science
long
he
got
little
beyond
the
statement
of
the
problem
and
the
marshaling
of
the
grosser
even
at
this
business
he
allowed
himself
to
be
constantly
interrupted
by
spooks
hobgoblins
seventh
sons
of
seventh
sons
and
other
such
characteristic
pets
of
psychologists
in
the
same
way
one
gustav
le
bon
a
frenchman
undertook
a
psychological
study
of
the
crowd
then
blew
up
add
the
investigations
of
freud
and
his
school
chiefly
into
abnormal
states
of
mind
and
those
of
lombroso
and
his
school
chiefly
quackish
and
for
the
yellow
journals
and
the
idle
romancing
of
such
inquirers
as
thorstein
veblen
and
you
have
exhausted
the
list
of
contributions
to
what
may
be
called
practical
and
everyday
psychology
the
rev
professors
i
daresay
have
been
doing
some
useful
plowing
and
planting
all
of
their
meticulous
and
measuring
and
in
the
course
of
time
will
enable
their
successors
to
approach
the
real
problems
of
mind
with
more
assurance
than
is
now
possible
and
perhaps
help
to
their
solution
but
in
the
meantime
the
public
and
social
utility
of
psychology
remains
very
small
for
it
is
still
unable
to
differentiate
accurately
between
the
true
and
the
false
or
to
give
us
any
effective
protection
against
the
fallacies
superstitions
crazes
and
hysterias
which
rage
in
the
world
in
this
emergency
it
is
not
only
permissible
but
even
laudable
for
the
amateur
to
sniff
inquiringly
through
the
psychological
pasture
essaying
modestly
to
uproot
things
that
the
myopic
or
perhaps
more
accurately
hypermetropic
professionals
have
overlooked
the
late
friedrich
wilhelm
nietzsche
did
it
often
and
the
usufructs
were
many
curious
and
daring
guesses
some
of
them
probably
close
to
accuracy
as
to
the
genesis
of
this
that
or
the
other
common
delusion
of
the
delusion
that
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
may
be
repealed
by
an
act
of
congress
into
the
same
field
several
very
interesting
expeditions
have
been
made
by
elsie
clews
parsons
a
lady
once
celebrated
by
park
row
for
her
invention
of
trial
invention
by
the
way
in
which
the
nietzsche
aforesaid
preceded
her
by
at
least
a
dozen
years
the
records
of
her
researches
are
to
be
found
in
a
brief
series
of
books
the
family
the
woman
and
fear
and
apparently
they
have
wrung
relatively
little
esteem
from
the
learned
for
i
seldom
encounter
a
reference
to
them
and
parsons
herself
is
denied
the
very
modest
reward
of
mention
in
who
s
who
in
nevertheless
they
are
extremely
instructive
books
particularly
fear
and
i
know
of
no
other
work
indeed
which
offers
a
better
array
of
observations
upon
that
powerful
complex
of
assumptions
prejudices
instinctive
reactions
racial
emotions
and
unbreakable
vices
of
mind
which
enters
so
massively
into
the
daily
thinking
of
all
of
us
the
author
does
not
concern
herself
as
so
many
psychologists
fall
into
the
habit
of
doing
with
thinking
as
a
purely
laboratory
phenomenon
a
process
in
vacuo
what
she
deals
with
is
thinking
as
it
is
done
by
men
and
women
in
the
real
that
is
only
half
intellectual
the
other
half
being
as
automatic
and
unintelligent
as
swallowing
blinking
the
eye
or
falling
in
love
the
power
of
the
complex
that
i
have
mentioned
is
usually
very
much
underestimated
not
only
by
psychologists
but
also
by
all
other
persons
who
pretend
to
culture
we
take
pride
in
the
fact
that
we
are
thinking
animals
and
like
to
believe
that
our
thoughts
are
free
but
the
truth
is
that
of
them
are
rigidly
conditioned
by
the
babbling
that
goes
on
around
us
from
birth
and
that
the
business
of
considering
this
babbling
objectively
separating
the
true
in
it
from
the
false
is
an
intellectual
feat
of
such
stupendous
difficulty
that
very
few
men
are
ever
able
to
achieve
it
the
amazing
slanging
which
went
on
between
the
english
professors
and
the
german
professors
in
the
early
days
of
the
late
war
showed
how
little
even
cold
and
academic
men
are
really
moved
by
the
bald
truth
and
how
much
by
hot
and
unintelligible
likes
and
dislikes
the
patriotic
hysteria
of
the
war
simply
allowed
these
eminent
pedagogues
to
say
of
one
another
openly
and
to
loud
applause
what
they
would
have
been
ashamed
to
say
in
times
of
greater
amenity
and
what
most
of
them
would
have
denied
stoutly
that
they
believed
nevertheless
it
is
probably
a
fact
that
before
there
was
a
sign
of
war
the
average
english
professor
deep
down
in
his
heart
thought
that
any
man
who
ate
sauerkraut
and
went
to
the
opera
in
a
and
intrigued
for
the
appellation
of
and
preferred
german
music
to
english
poetry
and
venerated
bismarck
and
called
his
wife
mutter
was
a
scoundrel
he
did
not
say
so
aloud
and
no
doubt
it
would
have
offended
him
had
you
accused
him
of
believing
it
but
he
believed
it
all
the
same
and
his
belief
in
it
gave
a
muddy
bilious
color
to
his
view
of
german
metaphysics
german
and
the
german
chronology
of
babylonian
kings
and
by
the
same
token
the
average
german
professor
far
down
in
the
ghostly
recesses
of
his
hulk
held
that
any
man
who
read
the
london
and
ate
salt
fish
at
first
breakfast
and
drank
tea
of
an
afternoon
and
spoke
of
oxford
as
a
university
was
a
a
and
possibly
even
a
nay
not
one
of
us
is
a
free
agent
not
one
of
us
actually
thinks
for
himself
or
in
any
orderly
and
scientific
manner
the
pressure
of
environment
of
mass
ideas
of
the
socialized
intelligence
improperly
so
called
is
too
enormous
to
be
withstood
no
american
no
matter
how
sharp
his
critical
sense
can
ever
get
away
from
the
notion
that
democracy
is
in
some
subtle
and
mysterious
way
more
conducive
to
human
progress
and
more
pleasing
to
a
just
god
than
any
of
the
systems
of
government
which
stand
opposed
to
it
in
the
privacy
of
his
study
he
may
observe
very
clearly
that
it
exalts
the
facile
and
specious
man
above
the
really
competent
man
and
from
this
observation
he
may
draw
the
conclusion
that
its
abandonment
would
be
desirable
but
once
he
emerges
from
his
academic
seclusion
and
resumes
the
rubbing
of
noses
with
his
he
will
begin
to
be
tortured
by
a
sneaking
feeling
that
such
ideas
are
heretical
and
unmanly
and
the
next
time
the
band
begins
to
play
he
will
thrill
with
the
best
of
the
worst
the
actual
phenomenon
in
truth
was
copiously
on
display
during
the
war
having
myself
the
character
among
my
acquaintances
of
one
holding
the
democratic
theory
in
some
doubt
i
was
often
approached
by
gentlemen
who
told
me
in
great
confidence
that
they
had
been
seized
by
the
same
tremors
among
them
were
journalists
employed
daily
in
demanding
that
democracy
be
forced
upon
the
whole
world
and
army
officers
engaged
at
least
theoretically
in
forcing
it
all
these
men
in
reflective
moments
struggled
with
ifs
and
buts
but
every
one
of
them
in
his
public
capacity
as
a
good
citizen
quickly
went
back
to
as
a
good
citizen
was
then
expected
to
think
and
even
to
a
certain
inflammatory
ranting
for
what
behind
the
door
he
gravely
questioned
it
is
the
business
of
parsons
in
fear
and
conventionality
to
prod
into
certain
of
the
ideas
which
thus
pour
into
every
man
s
mind
from
the
circumambient
air
sweeping
away
like
some
huge
cataract
the
feeble
resistance
that
his
own
powers
of
ratiocination
can
offer
in
particular
she
devotes
herself
to
an
examination
of
those
general
ideas
which
condition
the
thought
and
action
of
man
as
a
social
general
ideas
which
govern
his
everyday
attitude
toward
his
and
his
prevailing
view
of
himself
in
one
direction
they
lay
upon
us
the
bonds
of
what
we
call
etiquette
the
duty
of
considering
the
habits
and
feelings
of
those
around
in
another
direction
they
throttle
us
with
what
we
call
the
rules
which
protect
the
life
and
property
of
those
around
us
but
as
parsons
shows
the
boundary
between
etiquette
and
morality
is
very
dimly
drawn
and
it
is
often
impossible
to
say
of
a
given
action
whether
it
is
downright
immoral
or
merely
a
breach
of
the
punctilio
even
when
the
moral
law
is
plainly
running
considerations
of
mere
amenity
and
politeness
may
still
make
themselves
felt
thus
as
parsons
points
out
there
is
even
an
etiquette
of
adultery
the
de
la
vows
not
to
kiss
his
mistress
in
her
husband
s
house
in
fear
but
as
an
expression
of
conjugal
consideration
as
a
sign
that
he
has
not
forgotten
the
thoughtfulness
expected
of
a
gentleman
and
in
this
delicate
field
as
might
be
expected
the
differences
in
racial
attitudes
are
almost
diametrical
the
englishman
surprising
his
wife
with
a
lover
sues
the
rogue
for
damages
and
has
public
opinion
behind
him
but
for
an
american
to
do
it
would
be
for
him
to
lose
caste
at
once
and
forever
the
plain
and
only
duty
of
the
american
is
to
open
upon
the
fellow
with
artillery
hitting
him
if
the
scene
is
south
of
the
potomac
and
missing
him
if
it
is
above
i
confess
to
an
endless
interest
in
such
puzzling
niceties
and
to
much
curiosity
as
to
their
origins
and
meaning
why
do
we
americans
take
off
our
hats
when
we
meet
a
flapper
on
the
street
and
yet
stand
covered
before
a
male
of
the
highest
eminence
a
continental
would
regard
this
last
as
boorish
to
the
last
degree
in
greeting
any
equal
or
superior
male
or
female
actual
or
merely
conventional
he
lifts
his
why
does
it
strike
us
as
ludicrous
to
see
a
man
in
dress
clothes
before
the
continental
puts
them
on
whenever
he
has
a
solemn
visit
to
make
whether
the
hour
be
six
or
noon
why
do
we
regard
it
as
indecent
to
tuck
the
napkin
between
the
waistcoat
into
the
neck
meals
the
frenchman
does
it
without
thought
of
crime
so
does
the
italian
so
does
the
german
all
three
are
punctilious
more
so
indeed
than
we
are
why
do
we
snicker
at
the
man
who
wears
a
wedding
ring
most
continentals
would
stare
askance
at
the
husband
who
didn
t
why
is
it
bad
manners
in
europe
and
america
to
ask
a
stranger
his
or
her
age
and
a
friendly
attention
in
china
why
do
we
regard
it
as
absurd
to
distinguish
a
woman
by
her
husband
s
judge
jones
mrs
professor
smith
in
teutonic
and
scandinavian
europe
the
omission
of
the
title
would
be
looked
upon
as
an
affront
such
fine
distinctions
so
ardently
supported
raise
many
interesting
questions
but
the
attempt
to
answer
them
quickly
gets
one
bogged
several
years
ago
i
ventured
to
lift
a
sad
voice
against
a
custom
common
in
america
that
of
married
men
in
speaking
of
their
wives
employing
the
full
panoply
of
mrs
it
was
my
i
thought
by
logical
considerations
of
the
loftiest
a
husband
in
speaking
of
his
wife
to
his
equals
should
say
my
wife
the
more
formal
mode
of
designation
should
be
reserved
for
inferiors
and
for
strangers
of
undetermined
position
this
contention
somewhat
to
my
surprise
was
vigorously
combated
by
various
volunteer
experts
at
first
they
rested
their
case
upon
the
mere
authority
of
custom
forgetting
that
this
custom
was
by
no
means
universal
but
finally
one
of
them
came
forward
with
a
more
analytical
and
cogent
defense
to
wit
that
my
wife
connoted
proprietorship
and
was
thus
offensive
to
a
wife
s
but
what
of
my
sister
and
my
mother
surely
it
is
nowhere
the
custom
for
a
man
addressing
an
equal
to
speak
of
his
sister
as
miss
the
discussion
however
came
to
nothing
it
was
impossible
to
carry
it
on
logically
the
essence
of
all
such
inquiries
lies
in
the
discovery
that
there
is
a
force
within
the
liver
and
lights
of
man
that
is
infinitely
more
potent
than
logic
his
reflections
perhaps
may
take
on
intellectually
recognizable
forms
but
they
seldom
lead
to
intellectually
recognizable
conclusions
nevertheless
parsons
offers
something
in
her
book
that
may
conceivably
help
to
a
better
understanding
of
them
and
that
is
the
doctrine
that
the
strange
persistence
of
these
ideas
often
unintelligible
and
sometimes
plainly
absurd
is
due
to
fear
and
that
this
fear
is
the
product
of
a
very
real
danger
the
safety
of
human
society
lies
in
the
assumption
that
every
individual
composing
it
in
a
given
situation
will
act
in
a
manner
hitherto
approved
as
seemly
that
is
to
say
he
is
expected
to
react
to
his
environment
according
to
a
fixed
pattern
not
necessarily
because
that
pattern
is
the
best
imaginable
but
simply
because
it
is
determined
and
understood
if
he
fails
to
do
so
if
he
reacts
in
a
novel
perhaps
to
his
better
advantage
or
to
what
he
thinks
is
his
better
he
disappoints
the
expectation
of
those
around
him
and
forces
them
to
meet
the
new
situation
he
has
created
by
the
exercise
of
independent
thought
such
independent
thought
to
a
good
many
men
is
quite
impossible
and
to
the
overwhelming
majority
of
men
extremely
painful
to
all
of
us
says
parsons
to
the
animal
to
the
savage
and
to
the
civilized
being
few
demands
are
as
uncomfortable
disquieting
or
fearful
as
the
call
to
innovate
adaptations
we
all
of
us
dislike
or
hate
we
dodge
or
shirk
them
as
best
we
and
the
man
who
compels
us
to
make
them
against
our
wills
we
punish
by
withdrawing
from
him
that
understanding
and
friendliness
which
he
in
turn
looks
for
and
counts
upon
in
other
words
we
set
him
apart
as
one
who
is
and
not
to
be
dealt
with
and
according
as
his
rebellion
has
been
small
or
great
we
call
him
a
boor
or
a
criminal
this
distrust
of
the
unknown
this
fear
of
doing
something
unusual
is
probably
at
the
bottom
of
many
ideas
and
institutions
that
are
commonly
credited
to
other
motives
for
example
monogamy
the
orthodox
explanation
of
monogamy
is
that
it
is
a
manifestation
of
the
desire
to
have
and
to
hold
the
husband
defends
his
solitary
right
to
his
wife
even
at
the
cost
of
his
own
freedom
because
she
is
the
pearl
among
his
chattels
but
parsons
argues
and
with
a
good
deal
of
plausibility
that
the
real
moving
force
both
in
the
husband
and
the
wife
may
be
merely
the
force
of
habit
the
antipathy
to
experiment
and
innovation
it
is
easier
and
safer
to
stick
to
the
one
wife
than
to
risk
adventures
with
another
the
immense
social
pressure
that
i
have
just
described
is
all
on
the
side
of
sticking
moreover
the
indulgence
of
a
habit
automatically
strengthens
its
bonds
what
we
have
done
once
or
thought
once
we
are
more
apt
than
we
were
before
to
do
and
think
again
or
as
the
late
william
james
put
it
the
selection
of
a
particular
hole
to
live
in
of
a
particular
mate
a
particular
anything
in
short
out
of
a
possible
multitude
carries
with
it
an
insensibility
to
opportunities
and
insensibility
which
can
only
be
described
physiologically
as
an
inhibition
of
new
impulses
by
the
habit
of
old
ones
already
formed
the
possession
of
homes
and
wives
of
our
own
makes
us
strangely
insensible
to
the
charms
of
other
people
the
original
impulse
which
got
us
homes
wives
seems
to
exhaust
itself
in
its
first
achievements
and
to
leave
no
surplus
energy
for
reacting
on
new
thus
the
benedict
looks
no
more
on
women
at
least
for
a
while
and
the
bride
as
the
late
david
graham
phillips
once
told
us
neglects
the
bedizenments
which
got
her
a
man
in
view
of
the
popular
or
general
character
of
most
of
the
taboos
which
put
a
brake
upon
personal
liberty
in
thought
and
is
to
say
in
view
of
their
enforcement
by
people
in
the
mass
and
not
by
definite
specialists
in
is
quite
natural
to
find
that
they
are
of
extra
force
in
democratic
societies
for
it
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
democratic
societies
that
they
exalt
the
powers
of
the
majority
almost
infinitely
and
tend
to
deny
the
minority
any
rights
whatever
under
a
society
dominated
by
a
small
caste
the
revolutionist
in
custom
despite
the
axiom
to
the
contrary
has
a
relatively
easy
time
of
it
for
the
persons
whose
approval
he
seeks
for
his
innovation
are
relatively
few
in
number
and
most
of
them
are
already
habituated
to
more
or
less
intelligible
and
independent
thinking
but
under
a
democracy
he
is
opposed
by
a
horde
so
vast
that
it
is
a
practical
impossibility
for
him
without
complex
and
expensive
machinery
to
reach
and
convince
all
of
its
members
and
even
if
he
could
reach
them
he
would
find
most
of
them
quite
incapable
of
rising
out
of
their
accustomed
grooves
they
can
not
understand
innovations
that
are
genuinely
novel
and
they
don
t
want
to
understand
them
their
one
desire
is
to
put
them
down
even
at
this
late
day
with
enlightenment
raging
through
the
republic
like
a
pestilence
it
would
cost
the
average
southern
or
middle
western
congressman
his
seat
if
he
appeared
among
his
constituents
in
spats
or
wearing
a
and
if
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
however
gigantic
his
learning
and
his
juridic
rectitude
were
taken
in
crim
con
with
the
wife
of
a
senator
he
would
be
destroyed
instanter
and
if
suddenly
revolting
against
the
democratic
idea
he
were
to
propose
however
gingerly
its
abandonment
he
would
be
destroyed
with
the
same
dispatch
but
how
then
explain
the
fact
that
the
populace
is
constantly
ravished
and
set
aflame
by
fresh
brigades
of
moral
political
and
sociological
it
is
forever
playing
the
eager
victim
to
new
mountebanks
the
explanation
lies
in
the
simple
circumstance
that
these
performers
upon
the
public
midriff
are
always
careful
to
ladle
out
nothing
actually
new
and
hence
nothing
incomprehensible
alarming
and
accursed
what
they
offer
is
always
the
same
old
panacea
with
an
tried
tasted
and
dose
the
colic
cure
that
mother
used
to
make
superficially
the
united
states
seems
to
suffer
from
an
endless
and
astounding
neophilism
actually
all
its
thinking
is
done
within
the
boundaries
of
a
very
small
group
of
political
economic
and
religious
ideas
most
of
them
unsound
for
example
there
is
the
fundamental
idea
of
idea
that
all
political
power
should
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
populace
that
its
exercise
by
superior
men
is
intrinsically
immoral
out
of
this
idea
spring
innumerable
notions
and
crazes
that
are
no
more
at
bottom
than
restatements
of
it
in
sentimental
terms
rotation
in
office
direct
elections
the
initiative
and
referendum
the
recall
the
popular
primary
and
so
on
again
there
is
the
primary
doctrine
that
the
possession
of
great
wealth
is
a
doctrine
half
a
religious
heritage
and
half
the
product
of
mere
mob
envy
out
of
it
have
come
free
silver
government
ownership
populism
bleaseism
progressivism
the
milder
forms
of
socialism
the
whole
gasconade
of
reform
politics
yet
again
there
is
the
ineradicable
peasant
suspicion
of
the
man
who
is
having
a
better
time
in
the
suspicion
grounded
like
the
foregoing
partly
upon
undisguised
envy
and
partly
upon
archaic
and
barbaric
religious
taboos
out
of
it
have
come
all
the
glittering
pearls
of
the
uplift
from
abolition
to
prohibition
and
from
the
crusade
against
horseracing
to
the
mann
act
the
whole
political
history
of
the
united
states
is
a
history
of
these
three
ideas
there
has
never
been
an
issue
before
the
people
that
could
not
be
translated
into
one
or
another
of
them
what
is
more
they
have
also
colored
the
fundamental
philosophical
and
particularly
epistemological
doctrines
of
the
american
people
and
their
moral
theory
and
even
their
foreign
relations
the
late
war
very
unpopular
at
the
start
was
sold
to
them
as
the
advertising
phrase
has
it
by
representing
it
as
a
campaign
for
the
salvation
of
democracy
half
religious
and
wholly
altruistic
so
represented
to
them
they
embraced
it
represented
as
the
highly
obscure
and
complex
thing
it
actually
was
it
would
have
been
beyond
their
comprehension
and
hence
abhorrent
to
them
outside
this
circle
of
their
elemental
convictions
they
are
quite
incapable
of
rational
thought
one
is
not
surprised
to
hear
of
bismarck
a
thorough
royalist
discussing
democracy
with
calm
and
fairness
but
it
would
be
unimaginable
for
the
american
people
or
for
any
other
democratic
people
to
discuss
royalism
in
the
same
manner
it
would
take
a
cataclysm
to
bring
them
to
any
such
violation
of
their
mental
habits
when
such
a
cataclysm
occurs
they
embrace
the
new
ideas
that
are
its
fruits
with
the
same
adamantine
firmness
one
year
before
the
french
revolution
disobedience
to
the
king
was
unthinkable
to
the
average
frenchman
only
a
few
daringly
immoral
men
cherished
the
notion
but
one
year
the
fall
of
the
bastile
obedience
to
the
king
was
equally
unthinkable
the
russian
bolsheviki
whose
doings
have
furnished
a
great
deal
of
immensely
interesting
material
to
the
student
of
popular
psychology
put
the
principle
into
plain
words
once
they
were
in
the
saddle
they
decreed
the
abolition
of
the
old
imperial
censorship
and
announced
that
speech
would
be
free
only
so
long
as
it
kept
within
the
bounds
of
the
bolshevist
revelation
in
other
words
any
citizen
was
free
to
think
and
speak
whatever
he
only
so
long
as
it
did
not
violate
certain
fundamental
ideas
this
is
precisely
the
sort
of
freedom
that
has
prevailed
in
the
united
states
since
the
first
days
it
is
the
only
sort
of
freedom
comprehensible
to
the
average
man
it
accurately
reveals
his
constitutional
inability
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
illogical
and
often
quite
unintelligible
prejudices
instincts
and
mental
vices
that
condition
ninety
per
cent
of
all
his
thinking
but
here
i
wander
into
political
speculation
and
no
doubt
stand
in
contumacy
of
some
statute
of
congress
parsons
avoids
politics
in
her
very
interesting
book
she
confines
herself
to
the
purely
social
relations
between
man
and
woman
parent
and
child
host
and
guest
master
and
servant
the
facts
she
offers
are
vastly
interesting
and
their
discovery
and
coördination
reveal
a
tremendous
industry
but
of
even
greater
interest
are
the
facts
that
lie
over
the
margin
of
her
inquiry
here
is
a
golden
opportunity
for
other
investigators
i
often
wonder
that
the
field
is
so
little
explored
perhaps
the
freudians
once
they
get
rid
of
their
sexual
obsession
will
enter
it
and
chart
it
no
doubt
the
inferiority
complex
described
by
alfred
adler
will
one
day
provide
an
intelligible
explanation
of
many
of
the
puzzling
phenomena
of
mob
thinking
in
the
work
of
freud
himself
there
is
perhaps
a
clew
to
the
origin
and
anatomy
of
puritanism
that
worst
of
intellectual
nephritises
i
live
in
hope
that
the
freudians
will
fall
upon
the
business
without
much
further
delay
why
do
otherwise
sane
men
believe
in
spirits
what
is
the
genesis
of
the
american
axiom
that
the
fine
arts
are
unmanly
what
is
the
precise
machinery
of
the
process
called
falling
in
love
why
do
people
believe
newspapers
let
there
be
light
xiii
the
american
magazine
it
is
astonishing
considering
the
enormous
influence
of
the
popular
magazine
upon
american
literature
such
as
it
is
that
there
is
but
one
book
in
type
upon
magazine
history
in
the
republic
that
lone
volume
is
the
magazine
in
america
by
algernon
tassin
a
learned
of
the
great
university
of
columbia
and
it
is
so
badly
written
that
the
interest
of
its
matter
is
almost
but
fortunately
not
quite
the
professor
in
fact
puts
english
to
paper
with
all
the
traditional
dullness
of
his
flatulent
order
and
as
usual
he
is
most
horribly
dull
when
he
is
trying
most
kittenishly
to
be
lively
i
spare
you
examples
of
his
writing
if
you
know
the
lady
essayists
of
the
united
states
and
their
academic
imitators
in
pantaloons
you
know
the
sort
of
arch
and
whimsical
jocosity
he
ladles
out
but
as
i
have
hinted
there
is
something
worth
attending
to
in
his
story
for
all
the
defects
of
its
presentation
and
so
his
book
is
not
to
be
sniffed
at
he
has
at
all
events
brought
together
a
great
mass
of
scattered
and
concealed
facts
and
arranged
them
conveniently
for
whoever
deals
with
them
next
the
job
was
plainly
a
long
and
laborious
one
and
rasping
to
the
higher
cerebral
centers
the
historian
had
to
make
his
way
through
the
endless
files
of
old
and
stupid
magazines
he
had
to
read
the
insipid
biographies
and
autobiographies
of
dead
and
forgotten
editors
many
of
them
college
professors
preachers
out
of
work
uplifters
and
bad
poets
he
had
to
sort
out
the
facts
from
the
fancies
of
such
incurable
liars
as
griswold
he
had
to
hack
and
blast
a
path
across
a
virgin
wilderness
the
thing
was
worth
doing
and
as
i
say
it
has
been
done
with
commendable
pertinacity
considering
the
noisiness
of
the
american
magazines
of
it
is
rather
instructive
to
glance
back
at
the
timorous
and
bloodless
quality
of
their
progenitors
all
of
the
early
ones
when
they
were
not
simply
monthly
newspapers
or
almanacs
were
depressingly
literary
in
tone
and
dealt
chiefly
in
stupid
poetry
silly
essays
and
artificial
fiction
the
one
great
fear
of
their
editors
seems
to
have
been
that
of
offending
some
one
all
of
the
pioneer
prospectuses
were
full
of
assurances
that
nothing
would
be
printed
which
even
the
most
fastidious
could
object
to
literature
in
those
days
from
to
almost
completely
cut
off
from
contemporary
life
it
mirrored
not
the
struggle
for
existence
so
fierce
and
dramatic
in
the
new
nation
but
the
pallid
reflections
of
poetasters
clergymen
sissified
gentlemen
of
taste
and
other
such
donkeys
poe
waded
into
these
and
shook
them
up
a
bit
but
even
after
the
civil
war
the
majority
of
them
continued
to
spin
pretty
cobwebs
edmund
clarence
stedman
and
donald
mitchell
were
excellent
specimens
of
the
clan
its
last
survivor
was
the
lachrymose
william
winter
the
literature
manufactured
by
these
though
often
enough
produced
in
beer
cellars
was
frankly
aimed
at
the
young
person
its
main
purpose
was
to
avoid
giving
offense
it
breathed
a
heavy
and
oleaginous
piety
a
snug
niceness
a
sickening
sweetness
it
is
as
dead
as
baalam
s
ass
the
was
set
up
by
men
in
revolt
against
this
reign
of
mush
as
had
been
a
few
years
before
but
the
business
of
reform
proved
to
be
difficult
and
hazardous
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
a
healthier
breed
of
authors
could
be
developed
and
a
public
for
them
found
there
is
not
much
in
the
wrote
charles
eliot
norton

lowell
in
that
is
likely
to
be
read
twice

by
its
writers
and
this
is
what
the
great
public
likes
you
should
hear
godkin
express
himself
in
private
on
this
s
in
those
days
was
made
up
almost
wholly
of
cribbings
from
england
the
american
had
sunk
into
stodginess
and
imbecility
was
dead
or
dying
the
had
yet
to
discover
mark

it
was
the
era
of
s
lady
s
the
new
note
so
long
awaited
was
struck
at
last
by
now
the
and
not
to
be
confused
with
the
of
it
not
only
threw
all
the
old
traditions
overboard
it
established
new
traditions
almost
at
once
for
the
first
time
a
great
magazine
began
to
take
notice
of
the
daily
life
of
the
american
people
it
started
off
with
a
truly
remarkable
series
of
articles
on
the
civil
war
it
plunged
into
contemporary
politics
it
eagerly
sought
out
and
encouraged
new
writers
it
began
printing
decent
pictures
instead
of
the
old
chromos
it
forced
itself
by
the
sheer
originality
and
enterprise
of
its
editing
upon
the
public
attention
american
literature
owes
more
to
the
than
to
any
other
magazine
and
perhaps
american
thinking
owes
almost
as
much
it
was
the
first
literary
periodical
to
arrest
and
interest
the
really
men
of
the
country
it
beat
the
because
it
wasn
t
burdened
with
the
decaying
cargo
of
boston
brahmins
it
beat
all
the
others
because
it
was
infinitely
and
obviously
better
almost
everything
that
is
good
in
the
american
magazine
of
almost
everything
that
sets
it
above
the
english
magazine
or
the
continental
magazine
stems
from
the
at
the
moment
of
course
it
holds
no
such
clear
field
perhaps
it
has
served
its
function
and
is
ready
for
a
placid
old
age
the
thing
that
displaced
it
was
the
yellow
magazine
of
the
variety
of
magazine
which
surpassed
it
in
the
race
for
circulation
by
exaggerating
and
vulgarizing
all
its
merits
tassin
seems
to
think
with
william
archer
that
mcclure
was
the
inventor
of
this
type
but
the
truth
is
that
its
real
father
was
the
unknown
originator
of
the
sunday
supplement
what
shrewd
literary
was
to
apply
the
sensational
methods
of
the
cheap
newspaper
to
a
new
and
cheap
magazine
yellow
journalism
was
rising
and
he
went
in
on
the
tide
the
satanic
hearst
was
getting
on
his
legs
at
the
same
time
and
i
daresay
that
the
magazines
even
in
their
palmy
days
followed
him
a
good
deal
more
than
they
led
him
mcclure
and
the
imitators
of
mcclure
borrowed
his
adept
thumping
of
the
munsey
and
the
imitators
of
munsey
borrowed
his
mush
and
even
when
they
had
the
whole
nation
by
the
ears
did
little
save
repeat
in
solemn
awful
tones
what
hearst
had
said
before
as
for
at
the
height
of
its
circulation
it
was
little
more
than
a
sunday
magazine
section
on
smooth
paper
and
with
somewhat
clearer
than
hearst
could
print
nearly
all
the
genuinely
original
ideas
of
these
yankee
harmsworths
of
yesterday
turned
out
badly
john
brisben
walker
with
the
tried
to
make
his
magazine
a
sort
of
national
university
and
it
went
to
pot
ridgway
of
planned
a
weekly
to
be
published
in
a
dozen
cities
simultaneously
and
lost
a
fortune
trying
to
establish
it
mcclure
facing
a
situation
to
be
described
presently
couldn
t
manage
it
and
his
magazine
got
away
from
him
as
for
munsey
there
are
many
wrecks
behind
him
he
is
forever
experimenting
boldly
and
failing
gloriously
even
his
claim
to
have
invented
the
magazine
is
open
to
caveat
there
were
probably
plenty
of
such
things
in
substance
if
not
in
name
before
the
hearst
the
teacher
of
them
all
now
openly
holds
the
place
that
belongs
to
him
he
has
galvanized
the
corpse
of
the
old
into
a
great
success
he
has
distanced
all
rivals
with
he
has
beaten
the
english
on
their
own
ground
with
and
he
has
rehabilitated
various
lesser
magazines
more
he
has
forced
the
other
magazine
publishers
to
imitate
him
a
glance
at
offers
all
the
proof
that
is
needed
of
his
influence
upon
his
inferiors
tassin
apparently
in
fear
of
making
his
book
too
nearly
good
halts
his
chronicle
at
its
most
interesting
point
for
he
says
nothing
of
what
has
gone
on
since
very
much
indeed
has
gone
on
since
for
one
thing
the
evening
has
made
its
unparalleled
success
created
its
new
type
of
american
literature
for
department
store
buyers
and
shoe
drummers
and
bred
its
school
of
brisk
authors
for
another
thing
the
home
once
supreme
in
its
field
has
seen
the
rise
of
a
swarm
of
imitators
some
of
them
very
prosperous
for
a
third
thing
the
magazine
of
munsey
robert
bonner
and
street
smith
has
degenerated
into
so
dubious
a
hussy
that
munsey
a
very
moral
man
must
blush
every
time
he
thinks
of
it
for
a
fourth
thing
the
craze
has
created
an
entirely
new
type
of
magazine
and
it
has
elbowed
many
other
types
from
the
stands
and
for
a
fifth
thing
to
make
an
end
the
magazine
has
blown
up
and
is
no
more
why
this
last
have
all
the
possible
candidates
for
the
rake
been
raked
is
there
no
longer
any
taste
for
scandal
in
the
popular
breast
i
have
heard
endless
discussion
of
these
questions
and
many
ingenious
answers
but
all
of
them
fail
to
answer
in
this
emergency
i
offer
one
of
my
own
it
is
this
that
the
magazine
came
to
grief
not
because
the
public
tired
of
but
because
the
that
it
began
with
succeeded
that
is
to
say
the
villains
so
long
belabored
by
the
steffenses
the
tarbells
and
the
phillipses
were
either
driven
from
the
national
scene
or
forced
at
least
temporarily
into
rectitude
worse
their
places
in
public
life
were
largely
taken
by
nominees
whose
chemical
purity
was
guaranteed
by
these
same
magazines
and
so
the
latter
found
their
occupation
gone
and
their
following
with
it
the
great
masses
of
the
plain
people
eager
to
swallow
denunciation
in
doses
gagged
at
the
first
spoonful
of
praise
they
chortled
and
read
on
when
aldrich
boss
cox
gas
addicks
john
rockefeller
and
the
other
bugaboos
of
the
time
were
belabored
every
month
but
they
promptly
sickened
and
went
elsewhere
when
judge
ben
lindsey
francis
heney
governor
folk
and
the
rest
of
the
bogus
saints
began
to
be
hymned
the
same
phenomenon
is
constantly
witnessed
upon
the
lower
level
of
daily
journalism
let
a
vociferous
reform
newspaper
overthrow
the
old
gang
and
elect
its
own
candidates
and
at
once
it
is
in
a
perilous
condition
its
stock
in
trade
is
gone
it
can
no
longer
give
a
good
the
popular
meaning
of
a
good
show
for
what
the
public
wants
least
the
american
rough
work
it
delights
in
vituperation
it
revels
in
scandal
it
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
man
or
journal
making
the
charges
no
matter
how
slight
the
probability
that
the
accused
is
guilty
the
late
roosevelt
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
the
world
has
ever
seen
was
privy
to
this
fact
and
made
it
the
of
his
singularly
cynical
and
effective
politics
he
was
forever
calling
names
making
accusations
unearthing
and
denouncing
demons
wilson
a
performer
of
scarcely
less
talent
has
sought
to
pursue
the
same
plan
with
varying
fidelity
and
success
he
was
a
popular
hero
so
long
as
he
confined
himself
to
reviling
men
and
hell
hounds
of
plutocracy
the
socialists
the
kaiser
the
irish
the
senate
minority
but
the
moment
he
found
himself
on
the
side
of
the
defense
he
began
to
wobble
just
as
roosevelt
before
him
had
begun
to
wobble
when
he
found
himself
burdened
with
the
intricate
constructive
program
of
the
progressives
roosevelt
shook
himself
free
by
deserting
the
progressives
but
wilson
found
it
impossible
to
get
rid
of
his
league
of
nations
and
so
for
awhile
at
least
he
presented
a
quite
typical
picture
of
a
hamstrung
by
blows
from
the
wrong
end
of
the
rake
that
the
old
appetite
for
bloody
shows
is
not
dead
but
only
sleepeth
is
well
exhibited
by
the
recent
revival
of
the
weekly
of
opinion
ten
years
ago
the
weekly
seemed
to
be
absolutely
extinct
even
the
survived
only
as
a
appendage
of
the
then
of
a
sudden
the
alliance
was
broken
the
succumbed
to
wall
street
the
started
on
an
independent
straightway
made
a
great
success
and
why
simply
because
it
began
breaking
the
old
heads
of
the
era
of
course
but
nevertheless
heads
salient
enough
to
make
excellent
targets
for
years
it
had
been
moribund
no
one
read
it
save
a
dwindling
company
of
old
men
its
influence
gradually
approached
but
by
the
elementary
device
of
switching
from
mild
expostulation
to
violent
and
effective
denunciation
it
made
a
new
public
almost
overnight
and
is
now
very
widely
read
extensively
quoted
and
increasingly
heeded
i
often
wonder
that
so
few
publishers
of
periodicals
seem
aware
of
the
psychological
principle
here
exposed
it
is
known
to
every
newspaper
publisher
of
the
slightest
professional
intelligence
all
successful
newspapers
are
ceaselessly
querulous
and
bellicose
they
never
defend
any
one
or
anything
if
they
can
help
it
if
the
job
is
forced
upon
them
they
tackle
it
by
denouncing
some
one
or
something
else
the
plan
never
fails
turn
to
the
trade
magazines
the
most
prosperous
of
them
is
given
over
in
the
main
to
bitter
attacks
upon
new
films
come
back
to
daily
journalism
the
new
york
a
decaying
paper
well
nigh
rehabilitated
itself
by
attacking
hearst
the
cleverest
of
them
all
for
a
moment
apparently
dismayed
he
attempted
a
defense
of
came
near
falling
into
actual
disaster
then
recovering
his
old
form
he
began
a
whole
series
of
counter
attacks
and
cover
attacks
and
in
six
months
he
was
safe
and
sound
again
xiv
the
ulster
polonius
a
good
half
of
the
humor
of
the
late
mark
twain
consisted
of
admitting
frankly
the
possession
of
vices
and
weaknesses
that
all
of
us
have
and
few
of
us
care
to
acknowledge
practically
all
of
the
sagacity
of
george
bernard
shaw
consists
of
bellowing
vociferously
what
every
one
knows
i
think
i
am
as
well
acquainted
with
his
works
both
hortatory
and
dramatic
as
the
next
man
i
wrote
the
first
book
ever
devoted
to
a
discussion
of
them
and
i
read
them
pretty
steadily
even
and
with
endless
enjoyment
yet
so
far
as
i
know
i
have
never
found
an
original
idea
in
a
single
statement
of
fact
or
opinion
that
was
not
anteriorly
familiar
and
almost
commonplace
put
the
thesis
of
any
of
his
plays
into
a
plain
proposition
and
i
doubt
that
you
could
find
a
literate
man
in
christendom
who
had
not
heard
it
before
or
who
would
seriously
dispute
it
the
roots
of
each
one
of
them
are
in
platitude
the
roots
of
effective
are
in
platitude
that
a
dramatist
is
inevitably
a
platitudinarian
is
itself
a
platitude
double
damned
but
shaw
clings
to
the
obvious
even
when
he
is
not
hampered
by
the
suffocating
conventions
of
the
stage
his
fabian
tracts
and
his
pamphlets
on
the
war
are
veritable
compendiums
of
the
undeniable
what
is
seriously
stated
in
them
is
quite
beyond
logical
dispute
they
have
excited
a
great
deal
of
ire
they
have
brought
down
upon
him
a
great
deal
of
amusing
abuse
but
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
any
one
actually
controverting
them
as
well
try
to
controvert
the
copernican
astronomy
they
are
as
in
essence
as
the
multiplication
table
and
vastly
more
than
the
ten
commandments
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
well
then
why
does
the
ulsterman
kick
up
such
a
pother
why
is
he
regarded
as
an
almost
comparable
to
galileo
nietzsche
or
simon
magnus
for
the
simplest
of
reasons
because
he
practices
with
great
zest
and
skill
the
fine
art
of
exhibiting
the
obvious
in
unexpected
and
terrifying
he
is
a
master
of
the
logical
trick
of
so
matching
two
apparently
safe
premisses
that
they
yield
an
incongruous
and
inconvenient
all
because
he
is
a
fellow
of
the
utmost
charm
and
address
bold
persuasive
humorous
iconoclastic
brief
an
irishman
and
so
the
exact
antithesis
of
the
solemn
sassenachs
who
ordinarily
instruct
and
exhort
us
turn
to
his
man
and
superman
and
you
will
see
the
whole
shaw
machine
at
work
what
he
starts
out
with
is
the
fact
disputed
by
no
one
not
idiotic
that
a
woman
has
vastly
more
to
gain
by
marriage
under
christian
monogamy
than
a
man
that
fact
is
as
old
as
monogamy
itself
it
was
i
daresay
the
admitted
basis
of
the
palace
revolution
which
brought
monogamy
into
the
world
but
now
comes
shaw
with
an
implication
that
the
sentimentality
of
the
world
chooses
to
a
deduction
plainly
resident
in
the
original
proposition
but
kept
in
safe
silence
there
by
a
preposterous
and
hypocritical
wit
the
deduction
that
women
are
well
aware
of
the
profit
that
marriage
yields
for
them
and
that
they
are
thus
much
more
eager
to
marry
than
men
are
and
ever
alert
to
take
the
lead
in
the
business
this
second
fact
to
any
man
who
has
passed
through
the
terrible
years
between
and
forty
is
as
plain
as
the
first
but
by
a
sort
of
general
consent
it
is
not
openly
stated
violate
that
general
consent
and
you
are
guilty
of
shaw
is
simply
one
who
is
guilty
of
habitually
a
professional
criminal
in
that
department
it
is
his
life
work
to
announce
the
obvious
in
terms
of
the
scandalous
what
lies
under
the
horror
of
such
blabbing
is
the
deepest
and
most
widespread
of
human
weaknesses
which
is
to
say
intellectual
cowardice
the
craven
appetite
for
mental
ease
and
security
the
fear
of
thinking
things
out
all
men
are
afflicted
by
it
more
or
less
not
even
the
most
courageous
and
frank
of
men
likes
to
admit
in
specific
terms
that
his
wife
is
fat
or
that
she
seduced
him
to
the
altar
by
a
transparent
trick
or
that
their
joint
progeny
resemble
her
brother
or
father
and
are
thus
cads
a
few
extraordinary
heroes
of
logic
and
evidence
may
do
it
occasionally
but
only
occasionally
the
average
man
never
does
it
at
all
he
is
eternally
in
fear
of
what
he
knows
in
his
heart
his
whole
life
is
made
up
of
efforts
to
dodge
it
and
conceal
it
he
is
always
running
away
from
what
passes
for
his
intelligence
and
taking
refuge
in
what
pass
for
his
higher
feelings
his
stupidities
his
delusions
his
sentimentalities
shaw
is
devoted
to
the
art
of
hauling
this
recreant
fellow
up
he
is
one
who
for
purposes
of
sensation
often
for
the
mere
joy
of
outraging
the
resolutely
and
mercilessly
thinks
things
with
the
utmost
ingenuity
and
humor
but
often
it
must
be
said
in
the
same
muddled
way
that
the
average
would
do
it
if
he
ever
got
up
the
courage
remember
this
formula
and
all
of
the
fellow
s
alleged
originality
becomes
no
more
than
a
sort
of
audacity
usually
in
bad
taste
he
drags
skeletons
from
their
closet
and
makes
them
dance
every
one
of
course
knew
that
they
were
there
all
the
while
he
would
produce
an
excitement
of
exactly
the
same
kind
though
perhaps
superior
in
intensity
if
he
should
walk
down
the
strand
bared
to
the
waist
and
so
remind
the
shocked
londoners
of
the
unquestioned
fact
though
conventionally
concealed
and
forgotten
that
he
is
a
mammal
and
has
an
umbilicus
turn
to
a
typical
of
his
later
canon
say
androcles
and
the
here
the
complete
shaw
formula
is
exposed
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
mass
of
platitudes
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
air
of
a
on
the
one
hand
he
rehearses
facts
so
stale
that
even
methodist
clergymen
have
probably
heard
of
them
on
the
other
hand
he
states
them
so
scandalously
that
the
pious
get
all
of
the
thrills
out
of
the
business
that
would
accompany
a
view
of
the
rector
in
liquor
in
the
pulpit
here
for
example
are
some
of
his
contentions
a
that
the
social
and
economic
doctrines
preached
by
jesus
were
indistinguishable
from
what
is
now
called
socialism
b
that
the
pauline
transcendentalism
visible
in
the
acts
and
the
epistles
differs
enormously
from
the
simple
humanitarianism
set
forth
in
the
four
gospels
c
that
the
christianity
on
tap
would
be
almost
as
abhorrent
to
jesus
supposing
him
returned
to
earth
as
the
theories
of
nietzsche
hindenburg
or
clemenceau
and
vastly
more
abhorrent
than
those
of
emma
goldman
d
that
the
rejection
of
the
biblical
miracles
and
even
of
the
historical
credibility
of
the
gospels
by
no
means
disposes
of
christ
himself
e
that
the
early
christians
were
persecuted
not
because
their
theology
was
regarded
as
unsound
but
because
their
public
conduct
constituted
a
nuisance
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
on
could
any
one
imagine
a
more
abject
surrender
to
the
undeniable
would
it
be
possible
to
reduce
the
german
exegesis
of
a
century
and
a
half
to
a
more
depressing
series
of
platitudes
but
his
discussion
of
the
inconsistencies
between
the
four
gospels
is
even
worse
you
will
find
all
of
its
points
set
forth
in
any
elemental
treatise
upon
new
testament
in
so
childish
a
tract
as
ramsden
balmforth
s
he
actually
dishes
up
with
a
heavy
air
of
profundity
the
news
that
there
is
a
glaring
conflict
between
the
genealogy
of
jesus
in
matthew
i
and
the
direct
claim
of
divine
paternity
in
matthew
i
more
he
breaks
out
with
the
astounding
discovery
that
jesus
was
a
good
jew
and
that
paul
s
repudiation
of
circumcision
now
a
cardinal
article
of
the
christian
faith
would
have
surprised
him
and
perhaps
greatly
shocked
him
the
whole
preface
running
to
pages
is
made
up
of
just
such
stuff
searching
it
from
end
to
end
with
eagle
eye
i
have
failed
to
find
a
single
fact
or
argument
that
was
not
previously
familiar
to
me
despite
the
circumstance
that
i
ordinarily
give
little
attention
to
the
sacred
sciences
and
thus
might
have
been
expected
to
be
surprised
by
their
veriest
commonplaces
nevertheless
this
preface
makes
bouncing
therein
lies
the
secret
of
the
continued
vogue
of
shaw
he
has
a
large
and
extremely
uncommon
capacity
for
provocative
utterance
he
knows
how
to
get
a
touch
of
bellicosity
into
the
most
banal
of
doctrines
he
is
forever
on
tiptoe
forever
challenging
forever
his
matter
may
be
from
the
public
store
even
from
the
public
but
his
manner
is
always
all
his
own
the
tune
is
old
but
the
words
are
new
consider
for
example
his
discussion
of
the
personality
of
jesus
the
idea
is
simple
and
obvious
jesus
was
not
a
prophet
of
evil
like
john
the
baptist
nor
was
he
an
ascetic
or
a
mystic
but
here
is
the
shaw
way
of
saying
it
he
was
what
we
call
an
artist
and
a
bohemian
in
his
manner
of
the
fact
remains
unchanged
but
in
the
extravagant
statement
of
it
there
is
a
shock
for
those
who
have
been
confusing
the
sour
donkey
they
hear
of
a
sunday
with
the
tolerant
likable
man
they
profess
to
perhaps
there
is
even
a
genial
snicker
in
it
for
their
betters
so
with
his
treatment
of
the
atonement
his
objections
to
it
are
but
suddenly
he
gets
the
effect
of
novelty
by
pointing
out
the
quite
manifest
fact
that
acceptance
of
it
is
apt
to
make
for
weakness
that
the
man
who
rejects
it
is
thrown
back
upon
his
own
courage
and
circumspection
and
is
hence
stimulated
to
augment
them
the
first
jesus
was
of
free
and
easy
so
commonplace
that
i
have
heard
it
voiced
by
a
bishop
the
second
suggests
itself
so
naturally
that
i
myself
once
employed
it
against
a
chance
christian
encountered
in
a
pullman
this
christian
was
at
first
shocked
as
he
might
have
been
by
reading
shaw
but
in
half
an
hour
he
was
confessing
that
he
had
long
ago
thought
of
the
objection
himself
and
put
it
away
as
immoral
i
well
remember
his
fascinated
interest
as
i
showed
him
how
my
inability
to
accept
the
doctrine
put
a
heavy
burden
of
moral
responsibility
upon
me
and
forced
me
to
be
more
watchful
of
my
conduct
than
the
elect
of
god
and
so
robbed
me
of
many
pleasant
advantages
in
finance
the
dialectic
and
amour
a
double
jest
conceals
itself
in
the
shaw
legend
the
first
half
of
it
i
have
already
disclosed
the
second
half
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
shaw
is
not
at
all
the
wholesale
agnostic
his
fascinated
victims
see
him
but
an
orthodox
scotch
presbyterian
of
the
most
cocksure
and
bilious
fact
almost
the
archetype
of
the
in
the
theory
that
he
is
irish
i
take
little
stock
his
very
name
is
as
scotch
as
haggis
and
the
part
of
ireland
from
which
he
springs
is
peopled
almost
exclusively
by
scots
the
true
irishman
is
a
romantic
he
senses
life
as
a
mystery
a
thing
of
wonder
an
experience
of
passion
and
beauty
in
politics
he
is
not
logical
but
emotional
in
religion
his
interest
centers
not
in
the
commandments
but
in
the
sacraments
the
scot
on
the
contrary
is
almost
devoid
of
romanticism
he
is
a
materialist
a
logician
a
utilitarian
life
to
him
is
not
a
poem
but
a
series
of
police
regulations
god
is
not
an
indulgent
father
but
a
hanging
judge
there
are
no
saints
but
only
devils
beauty
is
a
lewdness
redeemable
only
in
the
service
of
morality
it
is
more
important
to
get
on
in
the
world
than
to
be
brushed
by
angels
wings
here
shaw
runs
exactly
true
to
type
read
his
critical
writings
from
end
to
end
and
you
will
not
find
the
slightest
hint
that
objects
of
art
were
passing
before
him
as
he
wrote
he
founded
in
england
the
superstition
that
ibsen
was
no
more
than
a
sort
of
brother
to
general
booth
pankhurst
and
the
syndics
of
the
sex
hygiene
society
he
turned
shakespeare
into
a
bird
of
evil
croaking
dismally
in
a
he
even
injected
a
moral
content
by
dint
of
herculean
straining
into
the
music
dramas
of
richard
the
most
colossal
sacrifices
of
moral
ideas
ever
made
on
the
altar
of
beauty
always
the
ethical
obsession
the
of
the
scotch
puritan
is
visible
in
him
his
politics
is
mere
moral
indignation
his
æsthetic
theory
is
cannibalism
upon
æsthetics
and
in
his
general
writing
he
is
forever
discovering
an
atrocity
in
what
was
hitherto
passed
as
no
more
than
a
human
weakness
he
is
forever
inventing
new
sins
and
demanding
their
punishment
he
always
sees
his
opponent
not
only
as
wrong
but
also
as
a
scoundrel
i
have
called
him
a
presbyterian
need
i
add
that
he
flirts
with
predestination
under
the
de
of
he
seems
to
be
convinced
that
while
men
may
not
be
responsible
for
their
virtues
they
are
undoubtedly
responsible
for
their
offendings
and
deserve
to
be
clubbed
therefor
and
this
is
shaw
the
revolutionist
the
heretic
next
perhaps
we
shall
be
hearing
of
benedict
xv
the
atheist
xv
an
unheeded
one
discerns
in
all
american
criticism
the
doctrine
that
ralph
waldo
emerson
was
a
great
man
but
the
specifications
supporting
that
doctrine
are
seldom
displayed
with
any
clarity
despite
the
vast
mass
of
writing
about
him
he
remains
to
be
worked
out
critically
practically
all
the
existing
criticism
of
him
is
marked
by
his
own
mellifluous
obscurity
perhaps
a
good
deal
of
this
obscurity
is
due
to
contradictions
inherent
in
the
man
s
character
he
was
dualism
ambulant
what
he
actually
was
seldom
identical
with
what
he
represented
himself
to
be
or
what
his
admirers
thought
him
to
be
universally
greeted
in
his
own
day
as
a
revolutionary
he
was
in
point
of
fact
imitative
and
importer
of
stale
german
elixirs
sometimes
direct
and
sometimes
through
the
carlylean
branch
house
who
took
good
care
to
dilute
them
with
buttermilk
before
merchanting
them
the
theoretical
spokesman
all
his
life
long
of
bold
and
forthright
thinking
of
the
unafraid
statement
of
ideas
he
stated
his
own
so
warily
and
so
muggily
that
they
were
ratified
on
the
one
hand
by
nietzsche
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
messiahs
of
the
new
thought
that
lavender
buncombe
what
one
notices
about
him
chiefly
is
his
lack
of
influence
upon
the
main
stream
of
american
thought
such
as
it
is
he
had
admirers
and
even
worshipers
but
no
apprentices
nietzscheism
and
the
new
thought
are
alike
tremendous
violations
of
orthodox
american
doctrine
the
one
makes
a
headlong
attack
upon
egalitarianism
the
of
american
politics
the
other
substitutes
mysticism
which
is
the
notion
that
the
true
realities
are
all
concealed
for
the
prevailing
american
notion
that
the
only
true
realities
lie
upon
the
surface
and
are
easily
discerned
by
congressmen
newspaper
editorial
writers
and
members
of
the
junior
order
of
united
american
mechanics
the
emerson
cult
in
america
has
been
an
affectation
from
the
start
not
many
of
the
chautauqua
orators
literary
professors
vassarized
old
maids
and
other
such
bogus
who
devote
themselves
to
it
have
any
intelligible
understanding
of
the
transcendentalism
at
the
heart
of
it
and
not
one
of
them
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
has
ever
executed
emerson
s
command
to
defer
never
to
the
popular
on
the
contrary
it
is
precisely
within
the
circle
of
emersonian
adulation
that
one
finds
the
greatest
tendency
to
test
all
ideas
by
their
respectability
to
combat
free
thought
as
something
intrinsically
vicious
and
to
yield
placidly
to
some
great
decorum
some
fetish
of
a
government
some
ephemeral
trade
or
war
or
it
is
surely
not
unworthy
of
notice
that
the
country
of
this
prophet
of
man
thinking
is
precisely
the
country
in
which
every
sort
of
dissent
from
the
current
pishposh
is
combated
most
ferociously
and
in
which
there
is
the
most
vigorous
existing
tendency
to
suppress
free
speech
altogether
thus
emerson
on
the
side
of
ideas
has
left
but
faint
tracks
behind
him
his
quest
was
for
facts
amidst
appearances
and
his
whole
metaphysic
revolved
around
a
doctrine
of
transcendental
first
causes
a
conception
of
interior
and
immutable
realities
distinct
from
and
superior
to
mere
transient
phenomena
but
the
philosophy
that
actually
prevails
among
his
philosophy
put
into
caressing
terms
by
william
an
almost
exactly
contrary
doctrine
its
central
idea
is
that
whatever
satisfies
the
immediate
need
is
substantially
true
that
appearance
is
the
only
form
of
fact
worthy
the
consideration
of
a
man
with
money
in
the
bank
and
the
old
flag
floating
over
him
and
hair
on
his
chest
nor
has
emerson
had
any
ponderable
influence
as
a
literary
artist
in
the
technical
sense
or
as
the
prophet
of
a
is
at
home
despite
the
feeble
imitations
of
campus
critics
his
manner
has
vanished
with
his
matter
there
is
in
the
true
sense
no
emersonian
school
of
american
writers
current
american
writing
with
its
cocksureness
its
somewhat
hard
competence
its
air
of
selling
goods
is
utterly
at
war
with
his
loose
impressionistic
method
his
often
mystifying
groping
for
ideas
his
relentless
pursuit
of
phrases
in
the
same
way
one
searches
the
country
in
vain
for
any
general
reaction
to
the
cultural
ideal
that
he
set
up
when
one
casts
about
for
salient
men
whom
he
moved
profoundly
men
who
got
light
from
his
torch
one
thinks
first
and
last
not
of
americans
but
of
such
men
as
nietzsche
and
hermann
grimm
the
germans
and
tyndall
and
matthew
arnold
the
englishmen
what
remains
of
him
at
home
as
i
have
said
is
no
more
than
on
the
one
hand
a
somewhat
absurd
affectation
of
intellectual
fastidiousness
now
almost
extinct
even
in
new
england
and
on
the
other
hand
a
debased
transcendentalism
rolled
into
pills
for
fat
women
with
vague
pains
and
inattentive
brief
the
new
brief
imbecility
this
new
thought
a
decadent
of
american
superficiality
now
almost
monopolizes
him
one
hears
of
him
in
its
preposterous
literature
and
one
hears
of
him
in
for
the
young
but
not
often
elsewhere
allowing
everything
it
would
surely
be
absurd
to
hold
that
he
has
colored
and
conditioned
the
main
stream
of
american
thought
as
goethe
colored
and
conditioned
the
thought
of

or

of

or

once
so
scanty
and
so
timorous
now
piles
mountain
high
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
formidable
series
of
books
of
instruction
for
inquirers
of
all
ages
beginning
with
what
every
child
of
ten
should
know
and
ending
with
what
a
woman
of
should
know
and
they
all
sell
amazingly
scores
of
diligent
authors
some
medical
some
clerical
and
some
merely
shrewdly
chautauqual
grow
rich
at
the
industry
of
composing
them
one
of
these
amateur
havelock
ellises
had
the
honor
during
the
last
century
of
instructing
me
in
the
elements
of
the
sacred
sciences
he
was
then
the
pastor
of
a
church
in
a
decaying
neighborhood
and
i
was
sent
to
his
in
response
to
some
obscure
notion
that
the
agony
of
it
would
improve
me
presently
he
disappeared
and
for
a
long
while
i
heard
nothing
about
him
then
he
came
into
sudden
prominence
as
the
author
of
such
a
series
of
handbooks
and
as
the
chief
stockholder
it
would
seem
in
the
publishing
house
printing
them
by
the
time
he
died
a
few
years
ago
he
had
been
so
well
rewarded
by
a
just
god
that
he
was
able
to
leave
funds
to
establish
a
missionary
college
in
some
remote
and
heathen
land
this
holy
man
i
believe
was
honest
and
took
his
platitudinous
compositions
quite
seriously
regarding
other
contributors
to
the
literature
it
may
be
said
without
malice
that
their
altruism
is
obviously
corrupted
by
a
good
deal
of
some
of
them
lecture
in
the
chautauquas
peddling
their
books
before
and
after
charming
the
yokels
others
being
members
of
the
faculty
seem
to
carry
on
medical
practice
on
the
side
yet
others
are
kept
in
profitable
jobs
by
the
salacious
old
men
who
finance
vice
crusades
it
is
hard
to
draw
the
line
between
the
mere
thrifty
enthusiast
and
the
downright
fraud
so
too
with
the
actual
vice
crusaders
the
books
of
the
latter
like
the
sex
hygiene
books
are
often
sold
not
as
wisdom
but
as
pornography
true
enough
they
are
always
displayed
in
the
of
the
methodist
book
you
will
also
find
them
in
the
of
dubious
side
by
side
with
the
familiar
editions
of
rabelais
margaret
of
navarre
and
balzac
s
droll
some
time
ago
in
a
book
advertisement
headed
snappy
fiction
i
found
announcements
of
my
battles
with
vice
by
virginia
life
of
my
heart
by
victoria
cross
the
former
was
described
by
the
publisher
as
a
record
of
personal
experiences
in
the
fight
against
the
gray
wolves
and
love
pirates
of
modern
the
book
was
offered
to
all
comers
by
mail
one
may
easily
imagine
the
effects
of
such
an
offer
but
even
the
most
serious
and
honest
of
the
sex
hygiene
volumes
are
probably
futile
for
they
are
all
founded
upon
a
pedagogical
error
that
is
to
say
they
are
all
founded
upon
an
attempt
to
explain
a
romantic
mystery
in
terms
of
an
exact
science
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
as
well
attempt
to
interpret
beethoven
in
terms
of
mathematical
many
a
fatuous
contrapuntist
indeed
has
tried
to
do
the
mystery
of
sex
presents
itself
to
the
young
not
as
a
scientific
problem
to
be
solved
but
as
a
romantic
emotion
to
be
accounted
for
the
only
result
of
the
current
endeavor
to
explain
its
phenomena
by
seeking
parallels
in
botany
is
to
make
botany
obscene
and
one
of
the
favorite
notions
of
the
puritan
mullahs
who
specialize
in
this
moral
pornography
is
that
the
sex
instinct
if
suitably
repressed
may
be
sublimated
into
the
higher
sorts
of
idealism
and
especially
into
æsthetic
idealism
that
notion
is
to
be
found
in
all
their
books
upon
it
they
ground
the
theory
that
the
enforcement
of
chastity
by
a
huge
force
of
spies
stool
pigeons
and
police
would
convert
the
republic
into
a
nation
of
incomparable
uplifters
and
artists
all
this
of
course
is
simply
pious
fudge
if
the
notion
were
actually
sound
then
all
the
great
artists
of
the
world
would
come
from
the
ranks
of
the
hermetically
repressed
from
the
ranks
of
puritan
old
maids
male
and
female
but
the
truth
is
as
every
one
knows
that
the
great
artists
of
the
world
are
never
puritans
and
seldom
even
ordinarily
respectable
no
virtuous
is
virtuous
in
the
ever
painted
a
picture
worth
looking
at
or
written
a
symphony
worth
hearing
or
a
book
worth
reading
and
it
is
highly
improbable
that
the
thing
has
ever
been
done
by
a
virtuous
woman
the
actual
effect
of
repression
lamentable
though
it
may
be
is
to
destroy
idealism
altogether
the
puritan
for
all
his
pretensions
is
the
worst
of
materialists
passed
through
his
sordid
and
unimaginative
mind
even
the
stupendous
romance
of
sex
is
reduced
to
a
disgusting
transaction
in
physiology
as
artist
he
is
thus
hopeless
as
well
expect
an
auctioneer
to
qualify
for
the
sistine
chapel
choir
all
he
ever
achieves
taking
pen
or
brush
in
hand
is
a
feeble
burlesque
of
his
betters
all
of
whom
by
his
hog
s
theology
are
doomed
to
hell
loss
to
perhaps
the
worst
thing
that
this
sex
hygiene
nonsense
has
accomplished
is
the
thing
mourned
by
agnes
repplier
in
the
repeal
of
in
america
at
least
innocence
has
been
killed
and
romance
has
been
sadly
wounded
by
the
same
discharge
of
smutty
artillery
the
flapper
is

all
this
of
course
is
highly
embarrassing
to
the
more
romantic
and
ingenuous
sort
of
men
of
whom
i
have
the
honor
to
be
one
we
are
constantly
in
the
position
of
general
mitchener
in
shaw
s
press
cuttings
when
he
begs
farrell
the
talkative
charwoman
to
reserve
her
confidences
for
her
medical
adviser
one
often
wonders
indeed
what
women
now
talk
of
to
doctors
please
do
not
misunderstand
me
here
i
do
not
object
to
this
new
freedom
on
moral
grounds
but
on
æsthetic
grounds
in
the
relations
between
the
sexes
all
beauty
is
founded
upon
romance
all
romance
is
founded
upon
mystery
and
all
mystery
is
founded
upon
ignorance
or
failing
that
upon
the
deliberate
denial
of
the
known
truth
to
be
in
love
is
merely
to
be
in
a
state
of
perceptual
mistake
an
ordinary
young
man
for
a
greek
god
or
an
ordinary
young
woman
for
a
goddess
but
how
can
this
condition
of
mind
survive
the
deadly
which
sex
hygiene
and
the
new
science
of
eugenics
impose
how
can
a
woman
continue
to
believe
in
the
honor
courage
and
loving
tenderness
of
a
man
after
she
has
learned
perhaps
by
affidavit
that
his
hæmoglobin
count
is
that
he
is
free
from
sugar
and
albumen
that
his
blood
pressure
is
and
that
his
wassermann
reaction
is
negative
moreover
all
this
frankness
tends
to
dam
up
at
least
for
civilized
adults
one
of
the
principal
of
art
to
wit
impropriety
what
is
neither
hidden
nor
forbidden
is
seldom
very
charming
if
women
continuing
their
present
tendency
to
its
logical
goal
end
by
going
stark
naked
there
will
be
no
more
poets
and
painters
but
only
dermatologists
and
photographers
on
the
the
effort
to
convert
the
theater
into
a
forum
of
solemn
sex
discussion
is
another
abhorrent
of
the
sex
hygiene
fortunately
it
seems
to
be
failing
a
few
years
ago
crowds
flocked
to
see
brieux
s
les
avariés
but
it
is
forgotten
and
its
successors
are
all
obscure
the
movement
originated
in
germany
with
the
production
of
frank
wedekind
s
frühlings
the
germans
gaped
and
twisted
in
their
seats
for
a
season
or
two
and
then
abandoned
sex
as
a
horror
and
went
back
to
sex
as
a
comedy
this
last
is
what
it
actually
should
be
at
least
in
the
theater
the
theater
is
no
place
for
painful
speculation
it
is
a
place
for
diverting
representation
its
best
and
truest
sex
plays
are
not
such
overstrained
shockers
as
le
mariage
d
olympe
and
damaged
goods
but
such
penetrating
and
excellent
comedies
as
much
ado
about
nothing
and
the
taming
of
the
in
much
ado
we
have
an
accurate
and
unforgettable
picture
of
the
way
in
which
the
normal
male
of
the
human
species
is
brought
to
the
is
by
the
way
of
appealing
to
his
hollow
vanity
the
way
of
capitalizing
his
native
and
ineradicable
asininity
and
in
the
taming
of
the
shrew
we
have
a
picture
of
the
way
in
which
the
average
woman
having
so
snared
him
is
purged
of
her
resultant
vainglory
and
bombast
and
thus
reduced
to
decent
discipline
and
decorum
that
the
marriage
may
go
on
in
solid
tranquillity
the
whole
drama
of
sex
in
real
life
as
well
as
on
the
stage
revolves
around
these
two
enterprises
of
it
consists
of
pitting
the
native
intelligence
of
women
against
the
native
sentimentality
of
men
and
the
other
half
consists
of
bringing
women
into
a
reasonable
order
that
their
superiority
may
not
be
too
horribly
obvious
to
the
first
division
belong
the
dramas
of
courtship
and
a
good
many
of
those
of
marital
conflict
in
each
case
the
essential
drama
is
not
a
tragedy
but
a
a
farce
in
each
case
the
conflict
is
not
between
imperishable
verities
but
between
mere
vanities
and
pretensions
this
is
the
essence
of
the
comic
the
unmasking
of
fraud
its
destruction
by
worse
fraud
marriage
as
we
know
it
in
christendom
though
its
utility
is
obvious
and
its
necessity
is
at
least
arguable
is
just
such
a
series
of
frauds
it
begins
with
the
fraud
that
the
impulse
to
it
is
lofty
unearthly
and
disinterested
it
proceeds
to
the
fraud
that
both
parties
are
equally
eager
for
it
and
equally
benefited
by
actually
happens
only
when
two
mondays
come
together
and
it
rests
thereafter
upon
the
fraud
that
what
is
once
agreeable
or
tolerable
remains
agreeable
ever
i
shall
be
exactly
the
same
man
in
that
i
am
and
that
my
wife
will
be
the
same
woman
and
intrigued
by
the
merits
of
the
same
man
this
last
assumption
is
so
outrageous
that
on
purely
evidential
and
logical
grounds
not
even
the
most
sentimental
person
would
support
it
it
thus
becomes
necessary
to
reënforce
it
by
attaching
to
it
the
concept
of
honor
that
is
to
say
it
is
held
up
not
on
the
ground
that
it
is
actually
true
but
on
the
ground
that
a
recognition
of
its
truth
is
part
of
the
bargain
made
at
the
altar
and
that
a
repudiation
of
this
bargain
would
be
dishonorable
here
we
have
honor
which
is
based
upon
a
sense
of
the
deepest
and
most
inviolable
truth
brought
in
to
support
something
admittedly
not
true
here
in
other
words
we
have
a
situation
in
comedy
almost
exactly
parallel
to
that
in
which
a
colored
bishop
whoops
onward
christian
soldiers
like
a
calliope
in
order
to
drown
out
the
crowing
of
the
rooster
concealed
beneath
his
chasuble
in
all
plays
of
the
sort
that
are
regarded
as
strong
and
significant
in
greenwich
village
in
the
finishing
schools
and
by
the
newspaper
critics
connubial
infidelity
is
the
chief
theme
smith
having
a
wife
smith
betrays
her
love
and
trust
by
running
off
with
miss
rabinowitz
his
stenographer
or
brown
detecting
her
husband
brown
in
lamentable
proceedings
with
a
neighbor
the
grass
widow
kraus
forgives
him
and
continues
to
be
true
to
him
in
consideration
of
her
children
fred
pansy
and
little
fern
both
situations
produce
a
great
deal
of
and
snuffing
among
the
softies
aforesaid
yet
neither
contains
the
slightest
touch
of
tragedy
and
neither
at
bottom
is
even
honest
both
on
the
contrary
are
based
upon
an
assumption
that
is
unsound
and
assumption
to
wit
that
the
position
of
the
injured
wife
is
grounded
upon
the
highest
the
injury
she
suffers
is
directed
at
her
lofty
and
impeccable
it
leaves
her
standing
in
an
heroic
attitude
all
this
soberly
examined
is
found
to
be
untrue
the
fact
is
that
her
moving
impulse
is
simply
a
desire
to
cut
a
good
figure
before
her
brief
that
plain
vanity
is
what
animates
her
this
public
expectation
that
she
will
endure
and
renounce
is
itself
hollow
and
sentimental
and
so
much
so
that
it
can
seldom
stand
much
strain
if
for
example
her
heroism
goes
beyond
a
certain
modest
she
carries
it
to
the
extent
of
complete
abnegation
and
reward
is
not
that
she
is
thought
heroic
but
that
she
is
thought
weak
and
foolish
and
if
by
any
chance
the
external
pressure
upon
her
is
removed
and
she
is
left
to
go
on
with
her
alleged
idealism
say
her
recreant
husband
dies
and
some
new
suitor
enters
to
dispute
the
theory
of
her
deathless
it
is
regarded
as
downright
insane
for
her
to
continue
playing
her
artificial
part
in
frank
comedy
we
see
the
situation
more
accurately
dealt
with
and
hence
more
honestly
and
more
instructively
instead
of
depicting
one
party
as
revolting
against
the
assumption
of
eternal
fidelity
melodramatically
and
the
other
as
facing
the
revolt
heroically
and
tragically
we
have
both
criticizing
it
by
a
flouting
of
necessarily
by
act
but
by
attitude
this
attitude
is
normal
and
sensible
it
rests
upon
genuine
human
traits
and
tendencies
it
is
sound
natural
and
honest
it
gives
the
comedy
of
the
stage
a
high
validity
that
the
bombastic
fustian
of
the
stage
can
never
show
all
the
sophomores
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
when
i
speak
of
infidelity
of
course
i
do
not
mean
only
the
gross
infidelity
of
strong
sex
plays
and
the
divorce
courts
but
that
lighter
infidelity
which
relieves
and
makes
bearable
the
burdens
of
theoretical
brief
the
natural
reaction
of
human
nature
against
an
artificial
and
preposterous
assumption
the
assumption
is
that
a
sexual
choice
once
made
is
that
all
desire
to
revoke
it
even
transiently
disappears
the
fact
is
that
no
human
choice
can
ever
be
of
that
irrevocable
character
and
that
the
very
existence
of
such
an
assumption
is
a
constant
provocation
to
challenge
it
and
rebel
against
it
what
we
have
in
marriage
in
any
other
such
a
constant
war
between
the
impulse
to
give
that
rebellion
objective
reality
and
a
social
pressure
which
puts
a
premium
on
submission
the
rebel
if
he
strikes
out
at
once
collides
with
a
solid
wall
the
bricks
of
which
are
made
up
of
the
social
assumption
of
his
docility
and
the
mortar
of
which
is
the
frozen
sentimentality
of
his
own
lost
fatuous
assumption
that
what
was
once
agreeable
to
him
would
be
always
agreeable
to
him
here
we
have
the
very
essence
of
situation
almost
exactly
parallel
to
that
of
the
pompous
old
gentleman
who
kicks
a
plug
hat
lying
on
the
sidewalk
and
stumps
his
toe
against
the
cobblestone
within
under
the
whole
of
the
conventional
assumption
reposes
an
assumption
even
more
foolish
to
wit
that
sexual
choice
is
regulated
by
some
transcendental
process
that
a
mysterious
accuracy
gets
into
it
that
it
is
limited
by
impenetrable
powers
that
there
is
for
every
man
one
certain
woman
this
sentimentality
not
only
underlies
the
theory
of
marriage
but
is
also
the
chief
apology
for
divorce
nothing
could
be
more
ridiculous
the
truth
is
that
marriages
in
christendom
are
determined
not
by
elective
affinities
but
by
the
most
trivial
accidents
and
that
the
issue
of
those
accidents
is
relatively
unimportant
that
is
to
say
a
normal
man
could
be
happy
with
any
one
of
at
least
two
dozen
women
of
his
acquaintance
and
a
man
specially
fitted
to
accept
the
false
assumptions
of
marriage
could
be
happy
with
almost
any
presentable
woman
of
his
race
class
and
age
he
is
married
to
marie
instead
of
to
gladys
because
marie
definitely
decided
to
marry
him
whereas
gladys
vacillated
between
him
and
some
other
and
marie
decided
to
marry
him
instead
of
some
other
not
because
the
impulse
was
irresistibly
stronger
but
simply
because
the
thing
seemed
more
feasible
in
such
choices
at
least
among
women
there
is
often
not
even
any
they
see
the
facts
clearly
and
even
if
later
on
they
are
swathed
in
sentimental
trappings
the
revelation
is
not
entirely
obliterated
here
we
have
comedy
double
combat
of
pretensions
on
the
one
side
perhaps
risen
to
but
on
the
other
side
more
or
less
uneasily
conscious
and
deliberate
this
is
the
true
soul
of
high
farce
this
is
something
not
to
snuffle
over
but
to
roar
at
xvii
george
jean
nathan
one
thinks
of
gordon
craig
not
as
a
jester
but
as
a
very
serious
and
even
solemn
fellow
for
a
dozen
years
past
all
the
more
sober
dramatic
critics
of
america
have
approached
him
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
to
the
gushing
old
maids
and
professors
of
the
drama
league
of
america
he
has
stood
for
the
last
word
in
theatrical
æstheticism
moreover
a
good
deal
of
this
veneration
has
been
deserved
for
craig
has
done
excellent
work
in
the
theater
and
is
a
man
of
much
force
and
ingenuity
and
no
little
originality
nevertheless
there
must
be
some
flavor
of
low
barroom
wit
in
him
some
echo
of
sir
toby
belch
and
the
captain
of
köpenick
for
a
year
or
so
ago
he
shook
up
his
admirers
with
a
joke
most
foul
need
i
say
that
i
refer
to
the
notorious
nathan
affair
imagine
the
scene
the
campus
archers
and
walkleys
in
ponderous
conclave
perhaps
preparing
their
monthly
cablegram
of
devotion
to
maeterlinck
arrives
now
a
messenger
with
dreadful
news
gordon
craig
from
his
italian
retreat
has
issued
a
bull
praising
nathan
which
nathan
george
jean
of
course
what
the
scaramouche
the
ribald
fellow
the
raffish
mocker
with
his
praise
of
florenz
ziegfeld
his
naughty
enthusiasm
for
pretty
legs
his
contumacious
scoffing
at
brieux
belasco
augustus
thomas
fiske
aye
even
so
and
what
has
craig
to
say
of
him
in
brief
that
he
is
the
american
dramatic
critic
worth
reading
that
he
knows
far
more
about
the
theater
than
all
the
honorary
pallbearers
of
criticism
rolled
together
that
he
is
immeasurably
the
superior
in
learning
in
sense
in
shrewdness
in
candor
in
plausibility
in
skill
at
writing
but
names
do
not
matter
craig
in
fact
did
not
bother
to
rehearse
them
he
simply
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
board
and
then
deftly
placed
the
somewhat
disconcerted
nathan
in
the
center
of
the
vacant
space
it
was
a
sad
day
for
the
honest
donkeys
who
for
half
a
decade
had
been
laboriously
establishing
craig
s
authority
in
america
but
it
was
a
glad
day
for
knopf
the
publisher
knopf
at
the
moment
had
just
issued
nathan
s
the
popular
at
once
he
rushed
to
a
job
printer
in
eighth
avenue
ordered
copies
of
the
craig
encomium
and
flooded
the
country
with
them
the
result
was
amusing
and
typical
of
the
republic
nathan
s
previous
books
when
praised
at
all
had
been
praised
faintly
and
with
reservations
the
fellow
it
appeared
was
too
spoofish
he
lacked
the
sobriety
and
dignity
necessary
to
a
true
critic
he
was
entertaining
but
not
to
be
taken
seriously
but
now
with
foreign
backing
and
particularly
english
backing
he
suddenly
began
to
acquire
merit
and
even
a
certain
vague
the
popular
theater
was
reviewed
more
lavishly
and
more
favorably
than
i
have
ever
seen
any
other
theater
book
reviewed
before
or
since
the
phenomenon
as
i
say
was
typical
the
childish
mass
of
superstitions
passing
for
civilized
opinion
in
america
was
turned
inside
out
overnight
by
one
authoritative
foreign
voice
i
have
myself
been
a
figure
in
the
same
familiar
process
all
of
my
books
up
to
the
american
language
were
in
the
main
hostilely
noticed
a
book
of
prefaces
in
particular
was
manhandled
by
the
orthodox
reviewers
then
just
before
the
american
language
was
issued
the
de
printed
an
article
commending
a
book
of
prefaces
in
high
astounding
terms
the
consequence
was
that
the
american
language
a
far
inferior
work
was
suddenly
discovered
to
be
full
of
merit
and
critics
of
the
utmost
respectability
who
had
ignored
all
my
former
books
printed
extremely
friendly
reviews
of
it
but
to
return
to
nathan
what
deceived
the
drama
leaguers
and
other
such
imposing
popinjays
for
so
long
causing
them
to
mistake
him
for
a
mere
sublimated
alan
dale
was
his
refusal
to
take
imbecilities
seriously
his
easy
casualness
and
avoidance
of
pedagogics
his
frank
delight
in
the
theater
as
a
all
his
bellicose
iconoclasm
and
devastating
wit
what
craig
an
intelligent
man
discerned
underneath
was
his
extraordinary
capacity
for
differentiating
between
sham
and
reality
his
catholic
freedom
from
formulæ
and
prejudice
his
astonishing
acquaintance
with
the
literature
of
the
practical
theater
his
firm
grounding
in
rational
æsthetic
all
his
capacity
for
making
the
thing
he
writes
of
interesting
his
uncommon
craftsmanship
this
craftsmanship
had
already
got
him
a
large
audience
he
had
been
for
half
a
dozen
years
indeed
one
of
the
most
widely
read
of
american
dramatic
critics
but
the
traditional
delusion
that
sagacity
and
dullness
are
somehow
identical
had
obscured
the
hard
and
accurate
thinking
that
made
the
show
what
was
so
amusing
seemed
necessarily
superficial
it
remained
for
craig
to
show
that
this
appearance
of
superficiality
was
only
an
appearance
that
the
nathan
criticism
was
well
planned
and
soundly
articulated
that
at
the
heart
of
it
there
was
a
sound
theory
of
the
theater
and
of
the
literature
of
the
theater
no
less
and
what
was
that
theory
you
will
find
it
nowhere
put
into
a
ready
formula
but
the
outlines
of
it
must
surely
be
familiar
to
any
one
who
has
read
another
book
on
the
theater
the
popular
theater
and
mr
george
jean
nathan
in
brief
it
is
the
doctrine
preached
with
so
much
ardor
by
benedetto
croce
and
his
disciple
spingarn
and
by
them
borrowed
from
goethe
and
doctrine
to
wit
that
every
work
of
art
is
at
bottom
unique
and
that
it
is
the
business
of
the
critic
not
to
label
it
and
it
but
to
seek
for
its
inner
intent
and
content
and
to
value
it
according
as
that
intent
is
carried
out
and
that
content
is
valid
and
worth
while
this
is
the
precise
opposite
of
the
academic
critical
attitude
the
professor
is
nothing
if
not
a
maker
of
he
must
classify
or
be
damned
his
masterpiece
is
the
dictum
that
it
is
excellent
but
it
is
not
a
nathan
has
a
far
more
intelligent
and
hospitable
eye
his
criterion
elastic
and
undefined
is
inimical
only
to
the
hollow
the
meretricious
the
fraudulent
it
bars
out
the
play
of
flabby
and
artificial
sentiment
it
bars
out
the
cheap
melodrama
however
gaudily
set
forth
it
bars
out
the
moony
mush
of
the
bad
imitators
of
ibsen
and
maeterlinck
it
bars
out
all
mere
claptrap
and
but
it
lets
in
every
play
however
conceived
or
designed
that
contains
an
intelligible
idea
well
worked
out
it
lets
in
every
play
by
a
dramatist
who
is
ingenious
and
original
and
genuinely
amusing
and
it
lets
in
every
other
sort
of
theatrical
spectacle
that
has
an
honest
aim
and
achieves
that
aim
passably
and
is
presented
frankly
for
what
it
is
bear
this
theory
in
mind
and
you
have
a
clear
explanation
of
nathan
s
actual
his
merciless
lampooning
of
the
of
broadway
and
the
pifflings
of
the
drama
league
geniuses
and
secondly
his
ardent
championing
of
such
widely
diverse
men
as
avery
hopwood
florenz
ziegfeld
ludwig
thoma
lord
dunsany
sasha
guitry
lothar
schmidt
ferenz
molnar
roberto
bracco
and
gerhart
hauptmann
all
of
whom
have
one
thing
in
common
they
are
intelligent
and
full
of
ideas
and
know
their
trade
in
europe
of
course
there
are
many
more
such
men
than
in
america
and
some
of
the
least
of
them
are
almost
as
good
as
our
best
that
is
why
nathan
is
forever
announcing
them
and
advocating
the
presentation
of
their
because
he
favors
foreignness
for
its
own
sake
but
because
it
is
so
often
accompanied
by
sound
achievement
and
by
stimulating
example
to
our
own
artists
and
that
is
why
when
he
tackles
the
maudlin
flubdub
of
the
broadway
dons
he
does
it
with
the
weapons
of
comedy
and
even
of
farce
does
an
augustus
thomas
rise
up
with
his
magic
and
platitudes
proving
heavily
that
love
is
mightier
than
the
sword
that
a
pure
heart
will
baffle
the
electric
chair
that
the
eye
is
quicker
than
the
hand
then
nathan
proceeds
against
him
with
a
slapstick
and
makes
excellent
practice
upon
his
pantaloons
does
a
belasco
thumb
on
forelock
posture
before
the
yeomanry
as
a
great
artist
the
evidence
being
a
large
chromo
of
a
childs
restaurant
and
a
studio
like
a
madison
avenue
then
nathan
flings
a
laugh
at
him
and
puts
him
in
his
place
and
does
some
fat
rhinoceros
of
an
actress
unearthing
a
smutty
play
by
a
racine
loose
its
banal
obscenities
upon
the
vulgar
in
the
name
of
sex
hygiene
presuming
thus
to
teach
a
great
lesson
and
break
the
conspiracy
of
silence
and
carry
on
the
noble
work
of
brieux
and
company
and
so
save
impatient
flappers
from
the
moloch
s
sacrifice
of
the
such
a
bumptious
and
preposterous
baggage
fill
the
newspapers
with
her
pishposh
and
the
largest
theater
in
manhattan
with
eager
dunderheads
then
the
ribald
jean
has
at
her
with
a
filled
with
the
pollen
of
the
driving
her
from
the
scene
to
the
tune
of
her
own
unearthly
sneezing
necessarily
he
has
to
lay
on
with
frequency
for
one
honest
play
honestly
produced
and
honestly
played
broadway
sees
two
dozen
that
are
simply
so
much
to
devote
serious
exposition
to
the
badness
of
such
stuff
would
be
to
descend
to
the
donkeyish
futility
of
william
winter
sometimes
indeed
even
ridicule
is
not
enough
there
must
be
a
briefer
and
more
dramatic
display
of
the
essential
banality
well
then
why
not
recreate
it
in
the
manner
of
touching
up
a
line
here
a
color
there
the
result
is
burlesque
but
burlesque
that
is
the
most
searching
and
illuminating
sort
of
criticism
who
will
forget
nathan
s
demonstration
that
a
platitudinous
play
by
thomas
would
be
better
if
played
backward
a
superb
bravura
piece
enormously
beyond
the
talents
of
any
other
american
writer
on
the
theater
it
smashed
the
thomas
legend
with
one
stroke
in
the
little
volume
called
bottoms
up
you
will
find
many
other
such
annihilating
waggeries
nathan
does
not
denounce
melodrama
with
a
black
cap
upon
his
head
painfully
demonstrating
its
inferiority
to
the
drama
of
ibsen
scribe
and
euripides
he
simply
sits
down
and
writes
a
little
melodrama
so
extravagantly
ludicrous
that
the
whole
genus
collapses
and
he
does
not
prove
in
four
columns
of
a
sunday
paper
that
french
plays
done
into
american
are
spoiled
he
simply
shows
the
spoiling
in
six
lines
this
method
of
course
makes
for
broken
heads
it
outrages
the
feelings
of
tender
theatrical
mountebanks
it
provokes
reprisals
more
or
less
furtive
and
behind
the
door
the
theater
in
america
as
in
most
other
countries
is
operated
chiefly
by
bounders
men
so
constantly
associated
with
actors
tend
to
take
on
the
qualities
of
the
idiotic
vanity
his
herculean
stupidity
his
chronic
underrating
of
his
betters
the
miasma
spreads
to
dramatists
and
dramatic
critics
the
former
drift
into
charlatanry
and
the
latter
into
a
cowardly
and
disgusting
dishonesty
amid
such
scenes
a
man
of
positive
ideas
of
civilized
tastes
and
of
unshakable
integrity
is
a
stranger
and
he
must
face
all
the
hostility
that
the
lower
orders
of
men
display
to
strangers
there
is
so
far
as
i
know
no
in
broadway
who
has
not
tried
at
one
time
or
another
to
dispose
of
nathan
by
he
has
been
exposed
to
all
the
measures
ordinarily
effective
against
rebellious
reviewers
and
resisting
them
he
has
been
treated
to
special
treatment
with
infernal
machines
of
novel
and
startling
design
no
writer
for
the
theater
has
been
harder
beset
and
none
has
been
less
incommoded
by
the
onslaught
what
is
more
he
has
never
made
the
slightest
effort
to
capitalize
this
invariable
device
of
lesser
men
so
far
as
i
am
aware
and
i
have
been
in
close
association
with
him
for
ten
years
it
has
had
not
the
slightest
effect
upon
him
whatsoever
a
thoroughgoing
skeptic
with
no
trace
in
him
of
the
messianic
delusion
he
has
avoided
timorousness
on
the
one
hand
and
indignation
on
the
other
no
man
could
be
less
a
public
martyr
of
the
metcalfe
type
it
would
probably
amuse
him
vastly
to
hear
it
argued
that
his
unbreakable
independence
and
often
somewhat
high
and
mighty
sniffishness
has
been
of
any
public
usefulness
i
sometimes
wonder
what
keeps
such
a
man
in
the
theater
breathing
bad
air
nightly
gaping
at
prancing
imbeciles
sitting
cheek
by
jowl
with
cads
perhaps
there
is
at
bottom
a
secret
lingering
residuum
of
a
boyish
delight
in
pasteboard
and
spangles
gaudy
colors
and
soothing
sounds
preposterous
heroes
and
appetizing
wenches
but
more
likely
it
is
a
sense
of
zest
of
a
man
to
whom
life
is
a
spectacle
that
never
grows
show
infinitely
surprising
amusing
buffoonish
vulgar
obscene
the
theater
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
not
life
in
miniature
but
life
enormously
magnified
life
hideously
exaggerated
its
emotions
are
ten
times
as
powerful
as
those
of
reality
its
ideas
are
twenty
times
as
idiotic
as
those
of
real
men
its
lights
and
colors
and
sounds
are
forty
times
as
blinding
and
deafening
as
those
of
nature
its
people
are
grotesque
burlesques
of
every
one
we
know
here
is
diversion
for
a
cynic
and
here
it
may
be
is
the
explanation
of
nathan
s
fidelity
whatever
the
cause
of
his
enchantment
it
seems
to
be
lasting
to
a
man
so
fertile
in
ideas
and
so
facile
in
putting
them
into
words
there
is
a
constant
temptation
to
make
experiments
to
plunge
into
strange
waters
to
seek
in
circles
and
yet
at
the
brink
of
forty
years
nathan
remains
faithful
to
the
theater
of
his
half
dozen
books
only
one
does
not
deal
with
it
and
that
one
is
a
very
small
one
in
four
or
five
years
he
has
scarcely
written
of
aught
else
i
doubt
that
anything
properly
describable
as
enthusiasm
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
assiduity
perhaps
the
right
word
is
curiosity
he
is
interested
mainly
not
in
the
staple
fare
of
the
playhouse
but
in
what
might
be
called
its
fancy
its
endless
stream
of
new
men
its
restless
innovations
the
radical
overhauling
that
it
has
been
undergoing
in
our
time
i
do
not
recall
in
any
of
his
books
or
articles
a
single
paragraph
appraising
the
classics
of
the
stage
or
more
than
a
brief
note
or
two
on
their
interpretation
his
attention
is
always
turned
in
a
quite
opposite
direction
he
is
intensely
interested
in
novelty
of
whatever
sort
if
it
be
only
free
from
sham
such
experimentalists
as
max
reinhardt
george
bernard
shaw
sasha
guitry
and
the
daring
nobodies
of
the
grand
guignol
such
divergent
originals
as
dunsany
ziegfeld
george
cohan
and
schnitzler
have
enlisted
his
eager
partisanship
he
saw
something
new
to
our
theater
in
the
farces
of
hopwood
before
any
one
else
saw
it
he
was
quick
to
welcome
the
novel
points
of
view
of
eleanor
gates
and
clare
kummer
he
at
once
rescued
what
was
sound
in
the
little
theatre
movement
from
what
was
mere
attitudinizing
and
in
the
view
of
broadway
an
exigent
and
even
malignant
fellow
wielding
a
pen
dipped
in
he
is
actually
amiable
to
the
last
degree
and
constantly
announces
pearls
in
the
fodder
of
the
swine
is
the
new
play
in
street
a
serious
work
of
art
as
the
and
the
newspaper
reviewers
say
then
so
are
your
grandmother
s
false
teeth
is
maeterlinck
a
great
thinker
then
so
is
frank
crane
is
belasco
a
profound
artist
then
so
is
the
man
who
designs
the
ceilings
of
hotel
dining
rooms
but
let
us
not
weep
too
soon
in
the
play
around
the
corner
there
is
a
clever
scene
next
door
amid
sickening
dullness
there
are
two
buffoons
who
could
be
worse
one
clouts
the
other
with
a
filled
with
mayonnaise
and
a
block
away
there
is
a
girl
in
the
second
row
with
a
very
charming
twist
of
the
let
us
sniff
the
roses
and
forget
the
thorns
what
this
attitude
chiefly
wars
with
even
above
cheapness
meretriciousness
and
banality
is
the
fatuous
effort
to
turn
the
theater
a
place
of
amusement
into
a
sort
of
outhouse
to
the
academic
complex
no
critic
in
america
and
none
in
england
save
perhaps
walkley
has
combated
this
movement
more
vigorously
than
nathan
he
is
under
no
illusion
as
to
the
functions
and
limitations
of
the
stage
he
knows
with
victor
hugo
that
the
best
it
can
do
in
the
domain
of
ideas
is
to
turn
thoughts
into
food
for
the
crowd
and
he
knows
that
only
the
simplest
and
shakiest
ideas
may
undergo
that
transformation
coming
upon
the
scene
at
the
height
of
the
ibsen
mania
of
half
a
generation
ago
he
ranged
himself
against
its
windy
pretenses
from
the
start
he
saw
at
once
the
high
merit
of
ibsen
as
a
dramatic
craftsman
and
welcomed
him
as
a
reformer
of
dramatic
technique
but
he
also
saw
how
platitudinous
was
the
ideational
content
of
his
plays
and
announced
the
fact
in
terms
highly
offensive
to
the
ibsenites
but
the
ibsenites
have
vanished
and
nathan
remains
he
has
survived
too
the
brieux
hubbub
he
has
lived
to
preach
the
funeral
sermon
of
the
belasco
legend
he
has
himself
sworded
maeterlinck
and
granville
barker
he
has
done
frightful
execution
upon
many
a
poor
mime
and
meanwhile
breasting
the
murky
tide
of
professorial
buncombe
of
solemn
pontificating
of
and
other
such
decaying
forms
of
he
has
rescued
dramatic
criticism
among
us
from
its
exile
with
theology
embalming
and
obstetrics
and
given
it
a
place
among
what
nietzsche
called
the
gay
sciences
along
with
war
and
laparotomy
he
has
made
it
amusing
stimulating
challenging
even
at
times
a
bit
startling
and
to
the
business
artfully
concealed
he
has
brought
a
sound
and
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
heavy
work
of
the
pioneers
lessing
schlegel
hazlitt
lewes
an
even
wider
acquaintance
lavishly
displayed
with
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
current
theatrical
scene
across
the
water
and
to
discharge
this
extraordinarily
copious
mass
of
information
he
has
hauled
and
battered
the
english
language
into
new
and
often
astounding
forms
and
when
english
has
failed
he
has
helped
it
out
with
french
german
italian
american
swedish
russian
turkish
latin
sanskrit
and
old
church
slavic
and
with
algebraic
symbols
chemical
formulæ
musical
notation
and
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
this
manner
of
course
is
not
without
its
perils
a
man
so
inordinately
articulate
is
bound
to
succumb
now
and
then
to
the
seductions
of
mere
virtuosity
the
average
writer
and
particularly
the
average
critic
of
the
drama
does
well
if
he
gets
a
single
new
and
racy
phrase
into
an
essay
nathan
does
well
if
he
dilutes
his
inventions
with
enough
commonplaces
to
enable
the
average
reader
to
understand
his
discourse
at
all
he
carries
the
avoidance
of
the
to
the
length
of
an
it
would
be
difficult
in
all
his
books
to
find
a
dozen
of
the
usual
rubber
stamps
of
criticism
i
daresay
it
would
kill
him
or
at
all
events
bring
him
down
with
cholera
morbus
to
discover
that
he
had
called
a
play
convincing
or
found
authority
in
the
snorting
of
an
english
at
best
this
incessant
flight
from
the
obvious
makes
for
a
piquant
and
arresting
style
a
procession
of
fantastic
and
often
highly
pungent
brief
for
nathanism
at
worst
it
becomes
artificiality
pedantry
obscurity
i
cite
an
example
from
an
essay
on
eleanor
gates
the
poor
little
rich
girl
prefaced
to
the
printed
play
as
against
the
not
unhallow
symbolic
strut
and
gasconade
of
such
pieces
as
let
us
for
example
say
the
blue
bird
of
maeterlinck
so
simple
and
unaffected
a
bit
of
stage
writing
as
school
dramatic
intrinsically
the
the
more
honest
heart
and
satisfies
more
plausibly
and
fully
those
of
us
whose
thumbs
are
ever
being
pulled
professionally
for
a
native
stage
less
smeared
with
the
snobberies
of
empty
albeit
nomenclatures
from
overseas
fancy
that
hedda
in
praise
of
a
simple
and
unaffected
bit
of
stage
writing
i
denounced
it
at
the
time
and
perhaps
with
some
effect
at
all
events
i
seem
to
notice
a
gradual
disentanglement
of
the
parts
of
speech
the
old
florid
invention
is
still
there
one
encounters
startling
coinages
in
even
the
most
casual
of
reviews
the
thing
still
flashes
and
glitters
the
tune
is
yet
upon
the
e
string
but
underneath
i
hear
a
more
sober
rhythm
than
of
old
the
fellow
in
fact
takes
on
a
sedater
habit
both
in
style
and
in
point
of
view
without
abandoning
anything
essential
without
making
the
slightest
concession
to
the
orthodox
opinion
that
he
so
magnificently
disdains
he
yet
begins
to
yield
to
the
middle
years
the
mere
shocking
of
the
stupid
is
no
longer
as
charming
as
it
used
to
be
what
he
now
offers
is
rather
more
sometimes
it
even
verges
upon
the
instructive
but
i
doubt
that
nathan
will
ever
become
a
professor
even
if
he
enjoys
the
hideously
prolonged
senility
of
a
william
winter
he
will
be
full
of
surprises
to
the
end
with
his
last
gasp
he
will
make
a
phrase
to
flabbergast
a

xviii
portrait
of
an
immortal
soul
one
day
in
spring
six
or
eight
years
ago
i
received
a
letter
from
a
man
somewhere
beyond
the
wabash
announcing
that
he
had
lately
completed
a
very
powerful
novel
and
hinting
that
my
critical
judgment
upon
it
would
give
him
great
comfort
such
notifications
at
that
time
reached
me
far
too
often
to
be
agreeable
and
so
i
sent
him
a
telling
him
that
i
was
ill
with
pleurisy
had
just
been
forbidden
by
my
oculist
to
use
my
eyes
and
was
about
to
become
a
father
the
aim
of
this
was
to
shunt
all
that
sort
of
trade
off
to
other
reviewers
but
for
once
it
failed
that
is
to
say
the
unknown
kept
on
writing
to
me
and
finally
offered
to
pay
me
an
honorarium
for
my
labor
this
offer
was
so
unusual
that
it
quite
demoralized
me
and
before
i
could
recover
i
had
received
cashed
and
dissipated
a
modest
check
and
was
confronted
by
an
accusing
manuscript
perhaps
four
inches
thick
but
growing
thicker
every
time
i
glanced
at
it
one
night
tortured
by
conscience
and
by
the
inquiries
and
reminders
arriving
from
the
author
by
every
post
i
took
up
the
sheets
and
settled
down
for
a
depressing
hour
or
two
of
it
no
i
did
read
all
night
no
it
was
a
masterpiece
no
it
has
made
the
stranger
famous
let
me
tell
the
story
quite
honestly
i
am
in
fact
far
too
rapid
a
reader
to
waste
a
whole
night
on
a
novel
i
had
got
through
this
one
by
midnight
and
was
sound
asleep
at
my
usual
time
and
it
was
by
no
means
a
masterpiece
on
the
contrary
it
was
inchoate
clumsy
and
in
part
artificial
insincere
and
preposterous
and
to
this
day
the
author
remains
obscure
but
underneath
all
the
amateurish
writing
the
striving
for
effects
that
failed
to
come
off
the
absurd
literary
the
recurrent
falsity
and
all
these
stigmata
of
a
neophyte
s
book
there
was
yet
a
capital
story
unusual
in
content
naïve
in
manner
and
enormously
engrossing
what
is
more
the
faults
that
it
showed
in
execution
were
most
of
them
not
ineradicable
on
page
after
page
as
i
read
on
i
saw
chances
to
improve
get
rid
of
its
intermittent
bathos
to
hasten
its
action
to
eliminate
its
spells
of
fine
writing
to
purge
it
of
its
imitations
of
all
the
bad
novels
ever
brief
to
tighten
it
organize
it
and
as
the
painters
say
tease
it
up
the
result
was
that
i
spent
the
next
morning
writing
the
author
a
long
letter
of
advice
it
went
to
him
with
the
manuscript
and
for
weeks
i
heard
nothing
from
him
then
the
manuscript
returned
and
i
read
it
again
this
time
i
had
a
genuine
surprise
not
only
had
the
unknown
followed
my
suggestions
with
much
intelligence
in
addition
once
set
up
on
the
right
track
he
had
devised
a
great
many
excellent
improvements
of
his
own
in
its
new
form
in
fact
the
thing
was
a
very
competent
and
even
dexterous
piece
of
writing
and
after
it
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
with
even
keener
interest
than
before
i
sent
it
to
mitchell
kennerley
then
an
active
publisher
and
asked
him
to
look
through
it
kennerley
made
an
offer
for
it
at
once
and
eight
or
nine
months
later
it
was
published
with
his
imprint
the
author
chose
to
conceal
himself
behind
the
de
of
robert
steele
i
myself
gave
the
book
the
title
of
one
it
came
from
the
straightway
died
the
death
the
only
favorable
review
it
received
was
mine
in
the
no
other
reviewer
paid
any
heed
to
it
no
one
gabbled
about
it
no
one
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
even
read
it
the
sale
was
small
from
the
start
and
quickly
stopped
altogether
to
this
day
the
fact
fills
me
with
wonder
to
this
day
i
marvel
that
so
dramatic
so
penetrating
and
so
curiously
moving
a
story
should
have
failed
so
overwhelmingly
for
i
have
never
been
able
to
convince
myself
that
i
was
wrong
about
it
on
the
contrary
i
am
more
certain
than
ever
it
after
half
a
dozen
years
that
i
was
it
was
and
is
one
of
the
most
honest
and
absorbing
human
documents
ever
printed
in
america
i
have
called
it
following
the
author
a
novel
it
is
in
fact
nothing
of
the
sort
it
is
autobiography
more
it
is
autobiography
unadorned
and
shameless
autobiography
almost
unbelievably
cruel
and
betraying
autobiography
that
is
as
devoid
of
artistic
sophistication
as
an
operation
for
this
steele
is
simply
too
stupid
too
ingenuous
too
moral
to
lie
he
is
the
very
reverse
of
an
artist
he
is
a
born
and
incurable
in
his
alleged
novel
he
draws
the
most
faithful
and
merciless
picture
of
an
american
puritan
that
has
ever
got
upon
paper
there
is
never
the
slightest
effort
at
amelioration
he
never
evades
the
ghastly
horror
of
it
he
never
tries
to
palm
off
himself
as
a
good
fellow
a
hero
instead
he
simply
takes
his
stand
in
the
center
of
the
platform
where
all
the
spotlights
meet
and
there
calmly
strips
off
his
raiment
of
his
sunday
then
his
coat
then
his
boiled
shirt
then
his
shoes
and
socks
and
finally
his
very
s
the
closing
scene
shows
the
authentic
the
eternal
in
the
nude
with
every
wart
and
pimple
glittering
and
every
warped
bone
and
flabby
muscle
telling
its
abhorrent
tale
there
stands
the
puritan
stripped
of
every
artifice
and
concealment
like
thackeray
s
louis
xiv
searching
my
memory
i
can
drag
up
no
recollection
of
another
such
of
secret
chambers
and
skeletonic
closets
set
beside
this
pious
babbler
the
late
giovanni
jacopo
casanova
de
seingalt
shrinks
to
the
puny
proportions
of
a
mere
barroom
boaster
a
don
juan
an
eighteenth
century
stock
company
leading
man
or
whiskey
drummer
so
too
benvenuto
cellini
a
fellow
vastly
entertaining
true
enough
but
after
all
not
so
much
a
psychological
historian
as
a
liar
a
yellow
journalist
one
always
feels
in
reading
benvenuto
that
the
man
who
is
telling
the
story
is
quite
distinct
from
the
man
about
whom
it
is
being
told
the
fellow
indeed
was
too
noble
an
artist
to
do
a
mere
portrait
with
fidelity
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
repair
a
cauliflower
ear
here
to
paint
out
a
scar
there
to
shine
up
the
eyes
a
bit
to
straighten
the
legs
down
below
but
this
whatever
his
name
may
steps
out
of
himself
he
is
never
describing
the
gaudy
one
he
would
to
be
but
always
the
commonplace
the
weak
the
emotional
the
ignorant
the
christian
male
that
he
actually
is
he
deplores
himself
he
distrusts
himself
he
plainly
wishes
heartily
that
he
was
not
himself
but
he
never
makes
the
slightest
attempt
to
disguise
and
bedizen
himself
such
as
he
is
cheap
mawkish
unæsthetic
he
depicts
himself
with
fierce
and
unrelenting
honesty
superficially
the
man
that
he
sets
before
us
seems
to
be
a
felonious
fellow
for
he
confesses
frankly
to
a
long
series
of
youthful
larcenies
to
a
somewhat
banal
adventure
in
forgery
leading
to
a
term
in
jail
to
sundry
petty
deceits
and
breaches
of
trust
and
to
an
almost
endless
chain
of
exploits
in
amour
most
of
them
sordid
and
unrelieved
by
anything
approaching
romance
but
the
inner
truth
about
him
of
course
is
that
he
is
really
a
moralist
of
the
his
one
fundamental
and
virtue
is
what
he
himself
regards
as
his
he
is
never
genuinely
human
and
likable
save
in
those
moments
which
lead
swiftly
to
his
most
florid
in
brief
the
history
is
that
of
a
moral
young
man
the
child
of
parents
and
its
moral
if
it
has
one
is
that
a
strictly
moral
upbringing
injects
poisons
into
the
system
that
even
the
most
steadfast
morality
can
not
resist
it
is
in
a
way
the
old
story
of
the
preacher
s
son
turned
sot
and
cutthroat
here
we
see
an
apparently
sound
and
normal
youngster
converted
into
a
sneak
and
rogue
by
the
intolerable
pressure
of
his
father
s
abominable
puritanism
and
once
a
rogue
we
see
him
make
himself
into
a
scoundrel
by
the
very
force
of
his
horror
of
his
roguery
every
step
downward
is
helped
from
above
it
is
not
until
he
resigns
himself
frankly
to
the
fact
of
his
incurable
degradation
and
so
ceases
to
struggle
against
it
that
he
ever
steps
out
of
it
the
external
facts
of
the
chronicle
are
simple
enough
the
son
of
a
school
teacher
turned
petty
lawyer
and
politician
the
hero
is
brought
up
under
such
barbaric
rigors
that
he
has
already
become
a
fluent
and
ingenious
liar
in
sheer
at
the
age
of
five
or
six
from
lying
he
proceeds
quite
naturally
to
stealing
he
lifts
a
few
dollars
from
a
neighbor
and
then
rifles
a
tin
bank
and
then
takes
to
filching
all
sorts
of
small
articles
from
the
storekeepers
of
the
vicinage
his
harsh
stupid
christian
father
getting
wind
of
these
peccadilloes
has
at
him
in
the
manner
of
a
mad
bull
beating
him
screaming
at
him
half
killing
him
the
boy
for
all
the
indecent
cruelty
of
it
is
convinced
of
the
justice
of
it
he
sees
himself
as
one
lost
he
accepts
the
fact
that
he
is
a
disgrace
to
his
family
in
the
end
he
embraces
the
parental
theory
that
there
is
something
strange
and
sinister
in
his
soul
that
he
couldn
t
be
good
if
he
tried
finally
filled
with
some
vague
notion
of
taking
his
abhorrent
self
out
of
sight
he
runs
away
from
home
brought
back
in
the
character
of
a
felon
he
runs
away
again
soon
he
is
a
felon
in
fact
that
is
to
say
he
forges
his
father
s
name
to
a
sheaf
of
checks
and
his
father
allows
him
to
go
to
prison
this
prison
term
gives
the
youngster
a
chance
to
think
things
out
for
himself
without
the
constant
intrusion
of
his
father
s
presbyterian
notions
of
right
or
wrong
the
result
is
a
measurably
saner
philosophy
than
that
he
absorbed
at
home
but
there
is
still
enough
left
of
the
old
moral
obsession
to
cripple
him
in
all
his
thinking
and
especially
in
his
thinking
about
himself
his
attitude
toward
women
for
example
is
constantly
conditioned
by
puritanical
misgivings
and
superstitions
he
can
never
view
them
innocently
joyously
unmorally
as
a
young
fellow
of
twenty
or
should
but
is
always
oppressed
by
notions
of
his
duty
to
them
and
to
society
in
general
on
the
one
hand
he
is
appalled
by
his
ready
yielding
to
those
hussies
who
have
at
him
unofficially
and
on
the
other
hand
he
is
filled
with
the
idea
that
it
would
be
immoral
for
him
an
to
go
to
the
altar
with
a
virgin
the
result
of
these
doubts
is
that
he
gives
a
good
deal
more
earnest
thought
to
the
woman
question
than
is
good
for
him
the
second
result
is
that
he
proves
an
easy
victim
to
the
discarded
mistress
of
his
employer
this
worthy
working
girl
craftily
snares
him
and
marries
then
breaks
down
on
their
wedding
night
unwomaned
so
to
speak
by
the
pathetic
innocence
of
the
ass
and
confesses
to
a
choice
roll
of
her
past
doings
ending
with
the
news
that
she
is
suffering
from
what
the
vice
crusaders
mellifluously
denominate
a
social
naturally
enough
the
blow
almost
kills
the
poor
is
still
in
fact
scarcely
out
of
his
the
problems
that
grow
out
of
the
confession
engage
him
for
the
better
part
of
the
next
two
years
always
he
approaches
them
and
wrestles
with
them
morally
always
his
search
is
for
the
way
that
the
maxims
approve
not
for
the
way
that
demands
even
when
a
brilliant
chance
for
revenge
presents
itself
and
he
is
forced
to
embrace
it
by
the
sheer
magnetic
pull
of
it
he
does
so
hesitatingly
doubtingly
ashamedly
his
whole
attitude
to
this
affair
indeed
is
that
of
an
early
christian
father
he
hates
himself
for
gathering
rosebuds
while
he
may
he
hates
the
woman
with
a
double
hatred
for
strewing
them
so
temptingly
in
his
path
and
in
the
end
like
the
moral
and
upright
fellow
that
he
is
he
sells
out
the
temptress
for
cash
in
hand
and
salves
his
conscience
by
handing
over
the
money
to
an
orphan
asylum
this
after
prayers
for
divine
guidance
a
fact
don
t
miss
the
story
of
it
in
the
book
you
will
go
far
before
you
get
another
such
illuminating
glimpse
into
a
pure
and
righteous
mind
so
in
episode
after
episode
one
observes
a
constant
oscillation
between
a
pharisaical
piety
and
a
hoggish
carnality
the
praying
brother
of
yesterday
is
the
roisterer
of
the
roisterer
of
is
the
snuffling
penitent
and
of
finally
he
is
pulled
both
ways
at
once
and
suffers
the
greatest
of
all
his
tortures
again
of
course
a
woman
is
at
the
center
of
time
a
stenographer
he
has
no
delusions
about
her
admits
herself
in
fact
that
it
is
all
the
same
he
falls
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
and
is
filled
with
an
inordinate
yearning
to
marry
her
and
settle
down
with
her
why
not
indeed
she
is
pretty
and
a
nice
girl
she
seems
to
reciprocate
his
affection
she
is
naturally
eager
for
the
obliterating
gold
band
she
will
undoubtedly
make
him
an
excellent
wife
but
he
has
forgotten
his
it
rises
up
in
revenge
and
floors
him
what
marry
a
girl
with
such
a
past
take
a
fancy
woman
to
his
bosom
jealousy
quickly
comes
to
the
aid
of
conscience
will
he
be
able
to
forget
contemplating
the
damsel
in
the
years
to
come
at
breakfast
at
dinner
across
the
domestic
hearth
in
the
cold
blue
dawn
will
he
ever
rid
his
mind
of
those
abhorrent
images
those
phantasms
of
men
here
at
the
very
end
we
come
to
the
most
engrossing
chapter
in
this
extraordinary
book
the
duelist
of
sex
thrust
through
the
gizzard
at
last
goes
off
to
a
lonely
hunting
camp
to
wrestle
with
his
intolerable
problem
he
describes
his
vacillations
faithfully
elaborately
cruelly
on
the
one
side
he
sets
his
honest
yearning
his
desire
to
have
done
with
light
loves
the
girl
herself
on
the
other
hand
he
ranges
his
moral
qualms
his
sneaking
distrusts
the
sinister
shadows
of
those
nameless
ones
his
morganatic
the
struggle
within
his
soul
is
gigantic
he
suffers
as
prometheus
suffered
on
the
rock
his
very
vitals
are
devoured
he
emerges
battered
and
exhausted
he
decides
in
the
end
that
he
will
marry
the
girl
she
has
wasted
the
shining
dowry
of
her
sex
she
comes
to
him
spotted
and
at
snickers
will
appear
in
the
polyphony
of
the
wedding
he
will
marry
her
nevertheless
it
will
be
a
marriage
unblessed
by
holy
writ
it
will
be
a
flying
in
the
face
of
moses
luck
and
the
archangels
will
be
against
he
will
marry
her
all
the
same
moses
or
no
moses
and
so
with
his
face
made
bright
by
his
first
genuine
revolt
against
the
archaic
barbaric
morality
that
has
dragged
him
down
and
his
heart
pulsing
to
his
first
display
of
authentic
unpolluted
charity
generosity
and
nobility
he
takes
his
departure
from
us
may
the
fates
favor
him
with
their
mercy
may
the
lord
god
strain
a
point
to
lift
him
out
of
his
purgatory
at
last
he
has
suffered
all
the
agonies
of
belief
he
has
done
abominable
penance
for
the
westminster
catechism
and
for
the
moral
order
of
the
world
and
for
all
the
despairing
misery
of
black
bombazine
little
bethel
goodness
he
is
puritanism
incarnate
and
puritanism
become
intolerable
i
daresay
any
bookseller
will
be
able
to
find
a
copy
of
the
book
for
you
one
man
by
robert
steele
there
is
some
raciness
in
the
detail
of
it
perhaps
despite
its
public
failure
it
enjoys
a
measure
of
esteem
behind
the
door
the
author
having
achieved
its
colossal
became
intrigued
by
the
notion
that
he
was
a
literary
man
of
sorts
and
informed
me
that
he
was
undertaking
the
story
of
the
girl
spotted
but
he
apparently
never
finished
it
no
doubt
he
discovered
before
he
had
gone
very
far
that
the
tale
was
intrinsically
beyond
his
fingers
all
turned
into
thumbs
when
he
got
beyond
his
own
personal
history
such
a
writer
once
he
has
told
the
one
big
story
is
done
for
xix
jack
london
the
of
genealogy
as
it
is
practiced
in
the
united
states
is
directed
almost
exclusively
toward
establishing
aristocratic
descents
for
nobodies
that
is
to
say
it
records
and
glorifies
decay
its
typical
masterpiece
is
the
discovery
that
the
wife
of
some
obscure
county
judge
is
the
grandchild
infinitely
removed
of
mary
queen
of
scots
or
that
the
blood
of
geoffrey
of
monmouth
flows
in
the
veins
of
a
philadelphia
stockbroker
how
much
more
profitably
its
professors
might
be
employed
in
tracing
the
lineage
of
truly
salient
and
distinguished
men
for
example
the
late
jack
london
where
did
he
get
his
hot
artistic
passion
his
delicate
feeling
for
form
and
color
his
extraordinary
skill
with
words
the
man
in
truth
was
an
instinctive
artist
of
a
high
order
and
if
ignorance
often
corrupted
his
art
it
only
made
the
fact
of
his
inborn
mastery
the
more
remarkable
no
other
popular
writer
of
his
time
did
any
better
writing
than
you
will
find
in
the
call
of
the
wild
or
in
parts
of
john
barleycorn
or
in
such
short
stories
as
the
sea
farmer
and
here
indeed
are
all
the
elements
of
sound
fiction
clear
thinking
a
sense
of
character
the
dramatic
instinct
and
above
all
the
adept
putting
together
of
charming
and
slyly
significant
words
arranged
in
a
french
phrase
for
the
respiration
and
the
ear
you
will
never
convince
me
that
this
æsthetic
sensitiveness
so
rare
so
precious
so
distinctively
aristocratic
burst
into
abiogenetic
flower
on
a
san
francisco
there
must
have
been
some
intrusion
of
an
alien
and
superior
strain
some
fillup
from
above
there
was
obviously
a
great
deal
more
to
the
thing
than
a
routine
hatching
in
low
life
perhaps
the
explanation
is
to
be
sought
in
a
jewish
smear
jews
were
not
few
in
the
california
of
a
generation
ago
and
one
of
them
at
least
attained
to
a
certain
high
if
transient
fame
with
the
pen
moreover
the
name
london
has
a
jewish
smack
the
jews
like
to
call
themselves
after
great
cities
i
have
indeed
heard
this
possibility
of
an
old
testament
descent
put
into
an
actual
rumor
stranger
genealogies
are
not
unknown
in
seaports
but
london
the
artist
did
not
live
there
was
also
london
the
amateur
great
thinker
and
the
second
often
hamstrung
the
first
that
great
thinking
of
his
of
course
took
color
from
the
sordid
misery
of
his
early
life
it
was
in
the
main
a
jejune
socialism
wholly
uncriticised
by
humor
some
of
his
propagandist
and
expository
books
are
almost
unbelievably
nonsensical
and
whenever
he
allowed
any
of
his
ideas
to
sneak
into
an
imaginative
work
the
intrusion
promptly
spoiled
it
socialism
in
truth
is
quite
incompatible
with
art
its
materialism
is
fundamentally
at
war
with
the
first
principle
of
the
æsthetic
gospel
which
is
that
one
daffodil
is
worth
ten
shares
of
bethlehem
steel
it
is
not
by
accident
that
there
has
never
been
a
book
on
socialism
which
was
also
a
work
of
art
papa
marx
s
das
kapital
at
once
comes
to
mind
it
is
as
wholly
devoid
of
graces
as
the
origin
of
species
or
science
and
health
one
simply
can
not
conceive
a
reasonable
man
reading
it
without
aversion
it
is
as
revolting
as
a
barrel
organ
london
preaching
socialism
or
or
whatever
it
was
that
he
preached
took
over
this
offensive
dullness
the
materialistic
conception
of
history
was
too
heavy
a
load
for
him
to
carry
when
he
would
create
beautiful
books
he
had
to
throw
it
overboard
as
wagner
threw
overboard
democracy
the
superman
and
free
thought
a
sort
of
temporary
christian
created
a
sort
of
temporary
aristocrat
created
the
call
of
the
also
in
another
way
london
s
early
absorption
of
social
and
economic
nostrums
damaged
him
as
an
artist
it
led
him
into
a
socialistic
exaltation
of
mere
money
it
put
a
touch
of
avarice
into
him
hence
his
too
deadly
industry
his
relentless
thousand
words
a
day
his
steady
emission
of
books
the
prophet
of
freedom
he
yet
sold
himself
into
slavery
to
the
publishers
and
paid
off
with
his
soul
for
his
ranch
his
horses
his
trappings
of
a
wealthy
his
volumes
rolled
out
almost
as
fast
as
those
of
phillips
oppenheim
he
simply
could
not
make
them
perfect
at
such
a
gait
there
are
books
on
his
example
the
scarlet
plague
and
the
little
lady
of
the
big
house
are
little
more
than
garrulous
notes
for
books
but
even
in
the
worst
of
them
one
comes
upon
sudden
splashes
of
brilliant
color
stray
proofs
of
the
adept
penman
reminders
that
london
at
bottom
was
no
fraud
he
left
enough
i
am
convinced
to
keep
him
in
mind
there
was
in
him
a
vast
delicacy
of
perception
a
high
feeling
a
sensitiveness
to
beauty
and
there
was
in
him
too
under
all
his
blatancies
a
poignant
sense
of
the
infinite
romance
and
mystery
of
human
life
xx
among
the
avatars
it
may
be
as
they
say
that
we
americanos
lie
in
the
gutter
of
civilization
but
all
the
while
our
eyes
steal
cautious
glances
at
the
stars
in
the
midst
of
the
prevailing
thin
incense
of
mysticism
as
a
relief
from
money
drives
politics
and
the
struggle
for
the
knights
of
pythias
passwords
grips
secret
work
the
degree
in
flight
from
peruna
mandrake
pills
and
science
the
emmanuel
movement
the
new
thought
the
tendency
already
has
its
poets
edwin
markham
and
ella
wheeler
wilcox
it
has
acquired
its
romancer
will
levington
comfort
this
comfort
wields
an
easy
pen
he
has
done
indeed
some
capital
melodramas
and
when
his
ardor
heats
him
up
he
grows
downright
eloquent
but
of
late
the
whole
force
of
his
æsthetic
engines
has
been
thrown
into
propaganda
by
the
bhagavad
gītā
out
of
victorian
sentimentalism
the
nature
of
this
propaganda
is
quickly
discerned
what
comfort
preaches
is
a
sort
of
mellowed
mariolatry
a
humorless
exaltation
of
woman
a
flashy
effort
to
turn
the
of
the
sexes
ordinarily
a
mere
cause
of
scandal
into
something
transcendental
and
highly
portentous
woman
it
appears
is
the
the
the
nascent
angel
she
is
the
upward
path
the
way
to
consecration
the
door
to
the
third
lustrous
dimension
all
the
mysteries
of
the
cosmos
are
concentrated
in
mystic
motherhood
whatever
that
may
be
i
capitalize
in
the
comfortian
and
new
thought
manner
on
one
page
of
fate
knocks
at
the
door
i
find
voices
pits
of
trade
woman
the
great
light
the
big
deep
and
the
twentieth
century
lie
on
another
are
the
rising
road
of
man
the
transcendental
soul
essence
the
way
uphill
the
sempiternal
mother
thus
andrew
bedient
the
spouting
hero
of
the
tale
i
believe
in
the
natural
greatness
of
woman
that
through
the
spirit
of
woman
are
born
sons
of
strength
that
only
through
the
potential
greatness
of
woman
comes
the
militant
greatness
of
man
i
believe
mothering
is
the
loveliest
of
the
arts
that
great
mothers
are
handmaidens
of
the
spirit
to
whom
are
intrusted
god
s
avatars
that
no
prophet
is
greater
than
his
mother
i
believe
when
humanity
arises
to
spiritual
evolution
as
it
once
evolved
through
flesh
and
is
now
evolving
through
mind
woman
will
assume
the
ethical
guiding
of
the
race
i
believe
that
the
holy
spirit
of
the
trinity
is
mystic
motherhood
and
the
source
of
the
divine
principle
is
woman
that
the
prophets
are
the
union
of
this
divine
principle
and
the
higher
manhood
that
they
are
beyond
the
attractions
of
women
of
flesh
because
unto
their
manhood
has
been
added
mystic
motherhood
i
believe
that
the
way
to
godhood
is
the
rising
road
of
man
i
believe
that
as
the
human
mother
brings
a
child
to
her
husband
the
mystic
motherhood
the
holy
spirit
is
bringing
the
world
to
god
the
father
the
capitals
are
andrew
comfort
s
i
merely
transcribe
and
perspire
this
andrew
it
appears
is
a
sea
cook
who
has
been
mellowed
and
transfigured
by
exhaustive
study
of
the
bhagavad
gītā
one
of
the
sacred
nonsense
books
of
the
hindus
he
doesn
t
know
who
his
father
was
and
he
remembers
his
mother
only
as
one
dying
in
a
strange
city
when
she
finally
passed
away
he
took
to
the
high
seas
and
mastered
marine
cookery
thus
for
many
years
up
and
down
the
world
then
he
went
ashore
at
manila
and
became
chef
to
an
army
packtrain
then
he
proceeded
to
china
to
japan
then
to
india
where
he
entered
the
forestry
service
and
plodded
the
himalayan
heights
always
with
the
bhagavad
gītā
under
his
arm
at
some
time
or
other
during
his
years
of
culinary
seafaring
he
saved
the
life
of
a
yankee
ship
captain
and
that
captain
later
dying
left
him
untold
millions
in
south
america
but
it
is
long
after
all
this
is
past
that
we
have
chiefly
to
do
with
him
he
is
now
a
young
monte
cristo
at
large
in
new
york
a
monte
cristo
worshiped
and
gurgled
over
by
a
crowd
of
mushy
old
maids
a
hero
of
parties
in
studios
the
madness
and
despair
of
senescent
virgins
but
it
is
not
andrew
s
wealth
that
inflames
these
old
girls
nor
even
his
manly
beauty
but
rather
his
revolutionary
and
astounding
sapience
his
great
gift
for
solemn
and
incomprehensible
utterance
his
skill
as
a
metaphysician
they
hang
upon
his
every
word
his
rhetoric
makes
their
heads
swim
once
he
gets
fully
under
way
they
almost
swoon
and
what
girls
they
are
alas
what
pathetic
toward
tinsel
stars
what
eager
hearing
of
the
soulful
gassy
stuff
one
of
them
has
red
hair
and
wine
dark
eyes
now
cryptic
black
now
suffused
with
red
glows
like
the
night
sky
above
a
prairie
another
is
tall
and
lovely
in
a
tragic
way
and
performs
upon
the
violoncello
a
third
is
a
tanned
woman
rather
variously
weathered
who
writes
stupefying
epigrams
about
whitman
and
the
latter
s
name
nietschze
of
course
a
fourth
is
the
gray
one
mystic
appellation
a
enough
you
get
the
picture
you
can
imagine
how
andrew
s
sagacity
staggers
these
poor
dears
you
can
see
them
fighting
for
him
each
against
all
with
sharp
psychical
excaliburs
arm
in
arm
with
all
this
exaltation
of
woman
of
course
goes
a
great
suspicion
of
mere
woman
the
combination
is
as
old
as
christian
mysticism
and
havelock
ellis
has
discussed
its
origin
and
nature
at
great
length
on
the
one
hand
is
the
on
the
other
hand
is
the
temptress
the
lorelei
the
madonna
and
mother
eve
the
celestial
virgins
and
the
succubi
the
hero
of
fate
knocks
at
the
door
for
all
his
flaming
words
still
distrusts
his
goddess
his
colleague
of
down
among
men
is
poisoned
by
the
same
suspicions
woman
has
led
him
up
to
grace
she
has
shown
him
the
upward
path
she
has
illuminated
him
with
her
mystic
the
moment
she
lets
go
his
hand
he
takes
to
his
heels
what
is
worse
he
sends
a
friend
to
her
i
forget
her
name
and
his
to
explain
in
detail
how
unfavorably
any
further
communion
with
her
would
corrupt
his
high
mission
to
save
the
downtrodden
by
writing
plays
that
fail
and
books
that
not
even
americans
will
read
an
intellectual
a
mixture
of
frank
crane
and
mother
tingley
of
edward
bok
and
the
archangel
eddy
so
far
not
much
of
this
ineffable
stuff
has
got
among
the
but
i
believe
that
it
is
on
its
way
despite
materialism
and
pragmatism
mysticism
is
steadily
growing
in
fashion
i
hear
of
paunchy
freemasons
holding
sacramental
meetings
on
maundy
thursday
of
senators
in
congress
railing
against
of
presidents
invoking
divine
intercession
at
cabinet
meetings
the
new
thoughters
march
on
they
have
at
least
a
dozen
prosperous
magazines
and
one
of
them
has
a
circulation
comparable
to
that
of
any
repository
of
lingerie
fiction
such
things
as
karma
the
ineffable
essence
and
the
zeitgeist
become
familiar
fauna
chained
up
in
the
cage
of
every
woman
s
club
thousands
of
american
women
know
far
more
about
the
subconscious
than
they
know
about
plain
sewing
the
pungency
of
myrrh
and
frankincense
is
mingled
with
de
physiology
is
formally
repealed
and
repudiated
its
laws
are
all
lies
no
doubt
the
fleshly
of
the
last
decade
with
its
blushing
amorousness
its
flashes
of
underwear
its
obstetrics
between
chapters
will
give
place
to
a
more
delicate
piece
of
in
this
new
thought
novel
the
hero
and
heroine
will
seek
each
other
out
not
to
spoon
obscenely
behind
the
door
but
for
the
purpose
of
uplifting
the
race
kissing
is
already
unsanitary
in
a
few
years

may
be
downright
sacrilegious

accursed
xxi
three
american
immortals
i
take
the
following
from
the
boston
of
may
a
beautiful
floral
book
stood
at
the
left
of
the
pulpit
being
spread
out
on
a
stand
its
last
page
was
composed
of
white
carnations
white
daisies
and
immortelles
on
the
leaf
was
displayed
in
neat
letters
of
purple
immortelles
the
word
this
device
was
about
two
feet
square
and
its
border
was
composed
of
different
colored
the
other
portion
of
the
book
was
composed
of
dark
and
flowers
the
front
of
the
large
pulpit
was
covered
with
a
mass
of
white
pine
boughs
laid
on
loosely
in
the
center
of
this
mass
of
boughs
appeared
a
large
harp
composed
of
yellow
jonquils
above
this
harp
was
a
handsome
bouquet
of
dark
pansies
on
each
side
appeared
large
clusters
of
calla
lilies
well
what
have
we
here
the
funeral
of
a
grand
exalted
pishposh
of
the
odd
fellows
of
an
east
side
tammany
leader
of
an
aged
and
much
respected
nay
what
we
have
here
is
the
funeral
of
ralph
waldo
emerson
it
was
thus
that
new
england
lavished
the
loveliest
fruits
of
the
puritan
æsthetic
upon
the
bier
of
her
greatest
son
it
was
thus
that
puritan
mourned
a
philosopher
allan
the
myth
that
there
is
a
monument
to
edgar
allan
poe
in
baltimore
is
widely
believed
there
are
even
persons
who
stopping
off
in
baltimore
to
eat
oysters
go
to
look
at
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
such
monument
exists
all
that
the
explorer
actually
finds
is
a
cheap
and
hideous
tombstone
in
the
corner
of
a
presbyterian
tombstone
quite
as
bad
as
the
worst
in
père
la
chaise
for
years
after
poe
s
death
there
was
not
even
this
the
grave
remained
wholly
unmarked
poe
had
surviving
relatives
in
baltimore
and
they
were
one
day
one
of
them
ordered
a
local
stonecutter
to
put
a
plain
stone
over
the
grave
the
stonecutter
hacked
it
out
and
was
preparing
to
haul
it
to
the
churchyard
when
a
runaway
smashed
into
his
and
broke
the
stone
to
bits
thereafter
the
poes
seem
to
have
forgotten
cousin
edgar
at
all
events
nothing
further
was
done
the
existing
tombstone
was
erected
by
a
committee
of
baltimore
schoolmarms
and
cost
about
it
took
the
dear
girls
ten
long
years
to
raise
the
money
they
started
out
with
a
literary
entertainment
which
yielded
this
was
in
six
years
later
the
fund
had
made
such
slow
progress
that
with
accumulated
interest
it
came
to
but
three
years
more
went
by
it
now
reached
then
some
anonymous
poeista
came
down
with
two
others
gave
each
one
of
the
devoted
schoolmarms
raised
in
nickels
and
dimes
and
george
childs
agreed
to
pay
any
remaining
deficit
during
all
this
time
not
a
single
american
author
of
position
gave
the
project
any
aid
and
when
finally
a
stone
was
carved
and
set
up
and
the
time
came
for
the
unveiling
the
only
one
who
appeared
at
the
ceremony
was
walt
whitman
all
the
other
persons
present
were
baltimore
schoolteachers
and
preachers
there
were
three
set
by
the
principal
of
a
local
high
school
the
second
by
a
teacher
in
the
same
seminary
and
the
third
by
a
man
who
was
invited
to
give
his
personal
recollections
of
poe
but
who
announced
in
his
third
sentence
that
i
never
saw
poe
but
once
and
our
interview
did
not
last
an
this
was
the
gaudiest
poe
celebration
ever
held
in
america
the
poet
has
never
enjoyed
such
august
posthumous
attentions
as
those
which
lately
flattered
the
shade
of
james
russell
lowell
at
his
actual
burial
in
exactly
eight
persons
were
present
of
whom
six
were
relatives
he
was
planted
as
i
have
said
in
a
presbyterian
churchyard
among
generations
of
honest
believers
in
infant
damnation
but
the
officiating
clergyman
was
a
methodist
two
days
after
his
death
a
baptist
gentleman
of
god
the
illustrious
rufus
griswold
printed
a
defamatory
article
upon
him
in
the
new
york
and
for
years
it
set
the
tone
of
native
criticism
of
him
and
so
he
rests
thrust
among
presbyterians
by
a
methodist
and
formally
damned
by
a
baptist
let
us
summon
from
the
shades
the
immortal
soul
of
james
harlan
born
in
entered
into
rest
in
in
the
year
this
harlan
resigned
from
the
united
states
senate
to
enter
the
cabinet
of
abraham
lincoln
as
secretary
of
the
interior
one
of
the
clerks
in
that
department
at
a
year
was
walt
whitman
lately
emerged
from
three
years
of
hard
service
as
an
army
nurse
during
the
civil
war
one
day
discovering
that
whitman
was
the
author
of
a
book
called
leaves
of
grass
harlan
ordered
him
incontinently
kicked
out
and
it
was
done
forthwith
let
us
remember
this
event
and
this
man
he
is
too
precious
to
die
let
us
repair
once
a
year
to
our
accustomed
houses
of
worship
and
there
give
thanks
to
god
that
one
day
in
brought
together
the
greatest
