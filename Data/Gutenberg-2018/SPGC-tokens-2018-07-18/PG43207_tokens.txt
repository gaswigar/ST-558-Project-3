introductory
note
there
is
one
question
upon
which
the
critics
and
lovers
of
dickens
seem
never
able
to
get
into
agreement
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
original
illustrations
to
his
works
to
the
enthusiast
phiz
and
dickens
seem
inseparable
and
no
edition
which
does
not
contain
the
old
familiar
grotesques
of
hablot
browne
imagination
or
in
the
earlier
volume
the
equally
abnormal
lineaments
portrayed
by
cruikshank
or
seymour
would
be
deemed
worthy
of
a
place
upon
his
bookshelf
but
a
younger
generation
is
growing
up
for
whom
the
pictures
have
not
the
charm
of
long
association
and
among
them
it
is
common
to
hear
the
complaint
that
the
natural
humour
and
pathos
of
the
best
works
are
spoiled
to
modern
fancy
by
the
violent
caricatures
of
the
illustrator
let
us
abolish
these
pictures
altogether
they
say
and
illustrate
the
books
with
pretty
conventionalities
by
more
fashionable
artists
at
the
opposite
pole
stands
yet
another
group
of
critics
the
superior
people
who
have
made
up
their
minds
that
dickens
himself
was
a
caricaturist
and
that
therefore
the
early
illustrations
even
if
they
do
a
little
emphasise
his
exaggerations
are
only
conceived
in
fitting
harmony
with
a
world
of
fancy
which
drowns
itself
in
excesses
of
the
grotesque
among
so
many
doctors
and
all
so
emphatic
who
shall
decide
it
is
at
any
rate
no
easy
task
it
happens
however
that
there
does
exist
a
series
of
dickens
illustrations
now
in
some
danger
of
being
unduly
neglected
in
which
the
artists
were
wonderfully
happy
in
preserving
the
original
features
of
phiz
and
cruikshank
interpretations
while
they
toned
down
the
more
extravagant
details
and
brought
imagination
into
closer
harmony
with
reality
these
were
the
illustrations
to
the
household
edition
published
in
just
after
the
great
novelist
death
and
now
reissued
in
this
dickens
in
the
hope
that
those
who
love
the
stories
may
like
to
possess
in
separate
form
what
is
perhaps
the
best
pictorial
accompaniment
that
the
novels
ever
received
at
the
time
of
its
first
publication
the
household
edition
enjoyed
an
enormous
success
at
the
moment
the
name
of
dickens
was
on
every
lips
and
the
fact
that
this
splendidly
illustrated
reprint
was
issued
in
penny
numbers
and
sixpenny
parts
placed
it
within
reach
of
even
the
most
humbly
stocked
purse
its
sale
was
stupendous
and
the
familiar
pamphlets
percolated
through
every
town
and
village
where
the
english
tongue
is
spoken
the
original
copies
may
still
be
met
with
under
many
a
country
timbered
roof
carefully
treasured
as
one
of
the
most
cherished
household
possessions
undoubtedly
a
great
part
of
the
success
was
due
to
the
art
of
the
illustrators
to
begin
with
there
was
an
unusually
liberal
display
of
pictures
the
edition
as
a
whole
containing
close
upon
nine
hundred
but
more
important
than
the
number
were
the
truth
and
sincerity
of
the
interpretations
qualities
which
helped
to
give
a
new
life
to
characters
already
secure
of
immortality
first
and
foremost
of
course
the
edition
will
always
be
associated
with
the
memory
of
fred
barnard
whose
pictures
are
the
outstanding
feature
of
the
present
volume
barnard
seemed
destined
by
nature
to
illustrate
dickens
the
spirit
of
boz
ran
again
in
his
veins
and
nothing
in
his
work
is
more
impressively
ingenious
than
the
skill
with
which
he
took
the
types
already
created
by
his
predecessors
preserved
their
characteristics
so
that
each
was
unmistakably
himself
and
yet
by
the
illuminating
touch
of
genius
transferred
them
every
one
from
the
realm
of
caricature
to
that
of
portraiture
not
far
inferior
to
him
was
that
admirable
draughtsman
charles
green
who
exactly
adopted
barnard
attitude
to
the
originals
the
reader
who
will
compare
green
illustrations
to
the
old
curiosity
shop
with
phiz
will
scarcely
fail
to
notice
with
interest
how
often
green
has
chosen
the
same
subject
as
his
predecessor
and
all
but
treated
it
in
the
same
manner
save
that
a
twisted
grotesque
suddenly
becomes
under
the
magic
of
his
wand
a
natural
human
being
his
picture
of
sally
brass
and
the
marchioness
is
a
remarkable
instance
in
point
but
there
are
many
others
equally
eloquent
of
his
sympathetic
and
interpretative
method
nor
should
the
work
of
mahony
a
b
frost
gordon
thomson
and
others
be
forgotten
for
each
in
his
own
way
has
helped
to
make
this
volume
what
its
publishers
confidently
claim
it
to
be
a
collection
of
dickens
pictures
unrivalled
for
humour
pathos
character
and
interpretative
skill
in
the
certainty
that
such
a
gallery
of
good
work
can
hardly
fail
to
find
appreciators
the

is
